00:02.323 --> 00:04.884
In New York City's war on crime,

00:04.884 --> 00:07.989
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:07.989 --> 00:10.024
of the Major Case Squad.

00:10.024 --> 00:12.724
These are their stories.

00:13.659 --> 00:17.092
Nana, when you were sick 
and you prayed to Brother Jerome,

00:17.092 --> 00:19.218
he visited you in a dream, right?

00:19.218 --> 00:20.515
That's right.

00:20.515 --> 00:24.089
Well, my doll Emily prayed 
to Brother Jerome, too.

00:24.089 --> 00:26.006
About her arthritis?

00:26.039 --> 00:31.201
But... I don't know if he can visit her 
because I don't know if dolls dream.

00:31.201 --> 00:33.075
I'm sure dolls dream.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.752
Maybe more than we do.

00:34.752 --> 00:36.509
Thanks, Nana.

00:36.509 --> 00:38.227
I'm happy to announce...

00:38.227 --> 00:41.851
that with this last quarter's acquisitions,
we're now fully documented.

00:41.851 --> 00:45.096
As Sean can attest,
the materials are spectacular.

00:45.096 --> 00:46.933
Yes. Yes, they are.

00:46.933 --> 00:52.642
We can now take the last step in 
what's been a journey of 82 years.

00:57.189 --> 00:59.566
If we hadn't been in housewares 
when we started fighting,

00:59.566 --> 01:01.184
I wouldn't have tried to stab him.

01:01.184 --> 01:06.948
That's the kind of rationalization that keeps 
you showing up to detox talkin' like a jerk.

01:06.948 --> 01:08.303
Who's this from?

01:08.303 --> 01:11.567
I don't know.
Somebody left it for me at the desk.

01:19.261 --> 01:23.724
I know this isn't the solution 
we anticipated.

01:23.724 --> 01:26.045
I tried to explain on the phone.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.316
You're sure?

01:27.316 --> 01:28.671
It's not too late to 
change your mind.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.442
It's the only thing 
we can do for now.

01:32.443 --> 01:35.266
Thanks for being so understanding.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.069
Is that for me?

01:42.069 --> 01:45.422
No, but I was gonna 
let you open it after your bath.

01:45.422 --> 01:48.868
It's getting cold, Lulu.
Come on.

01:49.259 --> 01:53.718
Nana, it's bad luck to let 
other people open your presents.

01:54.954 --> 01:56.332
Okay.

Nana!

02:27.285 --> 02:29.182
That's it then.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.041
It's finished.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.194
I don't want to hear 
any more about it.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2004/03/14

03:21.767 --> 03:24.462
Mrs. Politano's daughter said she 
brought the box home from work.

03:24.462 --> 03:27.303
The trick was inside...
a balloon loaded with lye.

03:27.303 --> 03:29.580
The top of the box was 
rigged with a pin.

03:29.580 --> 03:31.478
Where did she work?

03:31.478 --> 03:34.287
A rehab center in the Village.
She was a counselor.

03:34.287 --> 03:37.529
With lots of law-abiding clients,
I'm sure.

03:37.529 --> 03:40.046
And someone with 
a science background.

03:40.046 --> 03:43.642
How much science does lye 
in a balloon take?

03:43.775 --> 03:45.713
Um, enough.

03:45.713 --> 03:47.086
This device, uh,

03:47.086 --> 03:49.376
resolves a couple of problems.

03:49.376 --> 03:51.896
The first one is, uh,

03:51.930 --> 03:56.468
it would pass through 
any bomb-screening machine.

03:56.468 --> 04:00.488
And only the person who 
opens the box is... is affected.

04:00.488 --> 04:04.240
And only if she's standing 
directly over the top of it.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.599
Who put this here?

04:08.599 --> 04:11.703
Uh, her daughter,
while they were waiting for E.M.S.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.094
A relic.

04:18.346 --> 04:20.468
From a Brother Jerome.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.407
To watch over her?

04:23.557 --> 04:27.714
Why did BrotherJerome let Nana die 
this time and save her the time before?

04:27.714 --> 04:31.578
I'm sorry. Come on, Lulu.
You have to stay with Mommy.

04:36.592 --> 04:40.238
We're gonna stay with friends,
uh, for a few days.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.937
We're very sorry about your mother.

04:44.010 --> 04:46.411
Did she say anything about the gift?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.329
- Who it was from?
- No.

04:48.329 --> 04:51.733
Mom sometimes got 
presents from her clients.

04:51.826 --> 04:55.197
Was she having problems 
with anybody apart from her work?

04:55.197 --> 04:57.465
Mom was pretty good 
at hiding that stuff,

04:57.465 --> 05:00.736
but I could tell when 
she was having a bad time.

05:00.736 --> 05:04.011
Marzipan... 
she'd bring home a box.

05:04.011 --> 05:05.721
The last time she did that?

05:05.721 --> 05:07.797
A couple weeks ago.

05:09.867 --> 05:13.281
What did your daughter mean 
about your mother being saved?

05:14.477 --> 05:18.451
My mother was diagnosed 
with polio when she was 15,

05:18.451 --> 05:22.585
and she prayed to Brother Jerome,
and she recovered.

05:22.585 --> 05:25.185
People said it was a miracle.

05:25.185 --> 05:29.823
I'm not praying to him anymore 
and neither are my dolls.

New Morning Rehabilitation Center
227 West 118th Street
Wendesday, February 11

05:33.735 --> 05:37.184
The package was left at the front,
and nobody saw who delivered it.

05:37.184 --> 05:40.190
We'll need a list ofher clients 
going back a couple years.

05:40.190 --> 05:44.086
We're specifically interested in anyone 
with a science background.

05:44.086 --> 05:45.762
Doesn't ring any bells.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.522
Two weeks ago,
anything happen to upset her?

05:48.522 --> 05:50.155
Nothing she mentioned.

05:50.155 --> 05:52.050
If you need me, I'll be at the front.

05:53.516 --> 05:55.913
Just got a poem in the mail.

05:58.576 --> 06:01.857
It's postmarked upstate... 
Tannerville.

06:01.857 --> 06:04.278
A little over two weeks ago.

06:06.155 --> 06:09.791
"The Deceit of Nature's Radiance."

06:09.983 --> 06:13.686
It seems to be about 
the consequences of lying.

06:14.098 --> 06:15.873
It's unsigned.

06:15.873 --> 06:18.462
- There's no return address.
- Never a good sign.

06:18.462 --> 06:23.004
And our poet...
compares lying to the Drosera...

06:23.004 --> 06:28.750
and the carnivorous plants who 
disguise themselves to trap their prey.

06:28.750 --> 06:31.591
This person knows botany.

06:31.863 --> 06:35.968
- Looks old.
- It was written with a fountain pen.

06:36.098 --> 06:39.628
And the ink is...
bleeds to the other side of the paper.

06:39.628 --> 06:42.299
This was probably 
written 30, 40 years ago.

06:42.299 --> 06:46.534
There was a receipt 
in here for a church.

06:46.534 --> 06:49.165
She had a mass said 
for somebody last week.

06:49.165 --> 06:50.713
Here.

06:50.713 --> 06:53.048
At St. Anne's.

06:53.048 --> 06:55.145
A mass for the dead.

06:55.145 --> 06:57.161
It was for someone called Mack.

06:57.161 --> 07:00.072
I don't know whether that was 
a first name or a nickname.

07:00.072 --> 07:02.021
Louise didn't tell me 
anything about them.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.553
Was it a recent death?

07:03.553 --> 07:07.136
Louise didn't say,
but my guess, it was fairly recent.

07:07.136 --> 07:10.014
Ms. Politano was still in pain over it. 
You could tell.

07:10.014 --> 07:14.142
She asked me if one person 
could be held responsible...

07:14.142 --> 07:16.541
for another's loss of faith in God.

07:16.541 --> 07:20.637
I said, "Sure... 
if that one person is the devil."

07:20.637 --> 07:22.694
The person that 
you said the mass for,

07:22.694 --> 07:27.162
maybe their death was a result 
of a loss of faith, maybe a suicide?

07:27.162 --> 07:31.046
That would fit the bill.
But Louise didn't say.

07:31.239 --> 07:34.926
- Thanks, Father.
- All right. God bless.

07:34.926 --> 07:37.346
The poem was about deceit.

07:37.543 --> 07:41.269
Maybe the killer blames Louise 
for some kind of betrayal...

07:41.269 --> 07:43.126
that led to a suicide.

07:43.126 --> 07:45.503
Maybe the killer's a poet.

07:46.373 --> 07:48.377
We've been through her 
address book, client files.

07:48.377 --> 07:52.028
Nobody in there from Tannerville 
or the immediate area.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.800
No usable prints other than...

07:54.800 --> 07:56.880
Louise's on the poem.

07:57.770 --> 08:03.172
And the lab traced the watermark on the paper 
to a company that went out of business in 1959,

08:03.172 --> 08:07.913
and the ink contained a synthetic pigment 
manufacturers started using in 1957.

08:07.913 --> 08:10.676
So the poem was written...

08:11.007 --> 08:14.810
when Louise was in her mid-20s.
Could be an old boyfriend.

08:14.810 --> 08:17.250
Whoever it was...

08:17.250 --> 08:20.935
used language with confidence.

08:21.466 --> 08:23.995
"Hiding her decay 
under a mantle of ice,

08:23.995 --> 08:28.173
Mother Nature comes with hands pale 
and perfect forming the future."

08:28.173 --> 08:29.929
Nice.

08:29.929 --> 08:31.645
And this here.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.979
"It is not lying to seem 
one thing and be another.

08:34.979 --> 08:38.784
We learn from the deceit of nature."

08:40.052 --> 08:44.719
That wasn't their first effort 
and maybe not their last.

08:46.739 --> 08:48.898
Keyword poet,

08:48.898 --> 08:52.642
botany, suicide.

08:52.642 --> 08:56.629
Mary Karen Carnahan,
poet and botany professor.

08:56.629 --> 08:58.445
She took her own life...

08:58.445 --> 09:01.848
two years ago at age 70.

09:02.682 --> 09:04.116
A childhood friend.

09:04.116 --> 09:06.312
She's not in Louise's phone book.

09:06.312 --> 09:09.686
Maybe you should check 
Mary Carnahan's address book.

09:10.040 --> 09:14.033
Uh, her papers are archived 
at her alma mater, Dickerson College.

09:21.598 --> 09:23.558
Dickerson College
Bedford, New York
Thursday, February 12

09:23.558 --> 09:26.282
Mary Carnahan wrote 
this poem in her late 20s...

09:26.282 --> 09:29.057
when she really 
found her poetic voice.

09:29.057 --> 09:34.328
Did you ever come across a... 
a reference to, um, Louise Politano?

09:34.328 --> 09:36.044
I don't recognize the name.

09:36.044 --> 09:38.574
Maybe it's in 
the personal correspondence.

09:38.574 --> 09:42.729
So far, I've just been able 
to sort it chronologically.

09:42.729 --> 09:44.395
The early letters?

09:44.395 --> 09:47.777
Uh, let's see. 
This bundle here.

09:50.870 --> 09:53.673
Anything else from her youth?

09:53.673 --> 09:55.720
Well, there are...

09:55.720 --> 09:59.203
some high school essays,

09:59.203 --> 10:03.801
and, uh, some yearbooks 
in this box here...

10:03.801 --> 10:06.062
and some short stories.

10:06.062 --> 10:07.409
If you need me,
I'll be in the stacks.

10:07.409 --> 10:08.666
Pardon me.

10:12.119 --> 10:13.329
Bingo.

10:13.329 --> 10:16.015
Mary and Louise were 
on the yearbook committee together.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.434
Get a load of those saddle shoes.

10:18.686 --> 10:22.180
This is a note from, uh, 
Louise to Mary when they were teenagers.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.075
She refers to her as Mack.

10:24.075 --> 10:27.005
"Mack, I really messed up 
telling my mother

10:27.005 --> 10:30.348
I couldn't walk just so Father Luke 
would come to my house.

10:30.348 --> 10:32.000
"What a little idiot I am.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.434
Then pretending I had 
a dream about Brother Jerome?

10:34.434 --> 10:37.498
God must be so angry with me."

10:37.672 --> 10:41.344
She faked a miracle 
because of a crush on a priest.

10:41.344 --> 10:43.618
Yeah. Mary knew it and saw 
how people would believe it.

10:43.618 --> 10:47.581
Might be the reason for her 
depression and suicide.

10:47.581 --> 10:51.723
One fake miracle, 
two real deaths.

10:51.723 --> 10:56.436
Whoever sent the poem had to know 
Louise faked her miraculous cure.

10:56.436 --> 11:00.197
I had an aunt who used to pray to 
Brother Jerome instead of getting a flu shot.

11:00.197 --> 11:02.580
Someone could have been 
offended by what Louise did.

11:02.580 --> 11:05.904
Well, the stakes 
might be higher than that.

11:06.376 --> 11:09.141
Brother Jerome is up for a sainthood.

11:09.812 --> 11:12.631
He was a porter at Saint Joseph's 
in the Bronx in the late 1800s,

11:12.631 --> 11:17.979
and then he developed a following after he used 
"oil from the church lamps to heal a sick child."

11:17.979 --> 11:21.774
It says he healed hundreds of people 
before he died in 1920.

11:21.774 --> 11:24.577
One miracle, more or less,
is gonna make a difference to his sainthood?

11:24.577 --> 11:28.251
A-Aside from a documented 
miracle during a saint's life,

11:28.251 --> 11:31.227
you also need two miracles 
after his death.

11:31.227 --> 11:34.275
Like being healed after 
the saint visits you in a dream.

11:34.275 --> 11:36.877
If it comes out it was a teenage prank...

11:36.877 --> 11:39.742
Brother Jerome's 
sainthood might hit the skids.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.895
The Brother Jerome Foundation...

11:43.327 --> 11:46.256
is running the campaign for sainthood.

11:46.670 --> 11:49.063
Brother Jerome Foundation
81 West 85th Street
Monday, February 16

11:49.063 --> 11:53.684
The Louise Politano case was 
reviewed by the archdiocese.

11:53.684 --> 11:55.339
Her cure was fully documented.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.477
Mr. Sullivan,
Ms. Politano...

11:57.477 --> 11:59.859
She might have been killed to...

11:59.859 --> 12:02.581
keep her deception 
from coming out...

12:02.581 --> 12:05.365
and maybe by someone known 
to your foundation.

12:05.365 --> 12:07.880
I don't know anyone like that.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.374
Anyway, this whole thing is predicated 
on what I believe is a fabrication...

12:11.374 --> 12:15.713
by this disturbed poet to...
discredit Louise.

12:15.713 --> 12:20.686
Do you have any samples of Louise's 
handwriting from when she was 15?

12:20.686 --> 12:23.389
We have the essay that she wrote.

12:23.389 --> 12:28.443
The one she wrote for her parish priest 
describing her dream.

12:28.443 --> 12:34.780
Dad, they're suggesting that we have the note 
authenticated by comparing it to Louise's essay.

12:34.780 --> 12:36.901
Oh. Of course.

12:36.901 --> 12:38.357
Let's do that.

12:38.357 --> 12:41.840
But I don't want just anyone 
handling our documents.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.144
We have a man, a first-rate expert.

12:45.144 --> 12:48.267
Sean, give him James's number.

12:49.320 --> 12:53.671
The pressure of the downstroke,
the way it cuts into the paper.

12:53.671 --> 12:56.462
And the way she dots the "l" 
just to the right as an afterthought.

12:56.462 --> 12:59.785
- They look identical to me.
- That's because they are.

12:59.785 --> 13:03.740
The internal rhythms of the writing,
the isochrone... it's an identical match.

13:03.740 --> 13:06.381
Louise Politano wrote both of these.

13:06.632 --> 13:10.390
Well, that's not the answer 
the Sullivans expected...

13:10.390 --> 13:11.745
especially Richard.

13:11.745 --> 13:14.516
Ever since he took over 
the foundation from his grandfather,

13:14.516 --> 13:16.935
he's pushed very hard for sainthood.

13:16.935 --> 13:18.733
His son, Sean, hasn't?

13:18.733 --> 13:21.043
He's more interested 
in caring for sick children.

13:21.043 --> 13:23.342
That's the real work 
of the foundation.

13:24.536 --> 13:28.071
Did Richard or Sean say 
how they wanted to pay for this?

13:29.947 --> 13:31.906
Oh, uh,

13:32.638 --> 13:34.285
how do they normally pay you?

13:34.285 --> 13:38.985
They pay me a finder's fee 
to locate artifacts for their reliquary.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.482
What kinds of artifacts?

13:40.482 --> 13:43.482
Brother Jerome's clothes,
eating utensils, rosaries.

13:43.482 --> 13:48.351
Once he gets canonized, all this stuff is gonna 
be not only very valuable, but hard to find.

13:48.351 --> 13:50.752
The sainthood documents...

13:51.682 --> 13:54.023
Um, he didn't use you.

13:54.023 --> 13:58.112
Is that why you're wondering,
uh, how you're gonna get paid?

13:58.112 --> 14:01.231
I'll just call Sean. / Actually, 
the department will take care of it.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.424
We just need a bill.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.716
Just give me a minute.

14:05.525 --> 14:09.862
Sullivan, Sr. Sent us here thinking 
the call would go his way.

14:09.862 --> 14:15.176
Unless there's another reason he kept us 
away from his regular authenticator.

14:15.176 --> 14:17.503
Bartleby's Auction house
142 East 72nd Street
Thursday, February 19

14:17.503 --> 14:21.488
I can't imagine why Richard Sullivan 
sent you toJames Bennett.

14:21.488 --> 14:24.535
The archdiocese told us that over 
the last 10 years you've been...

14:24.535 --> 14:27.220
authenticating all 
the foundation's documents.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.811
That's right.

14:29.443 --> 14:32.234
Well, what... 
what were they?

14:32.234 --> 14:33.429
Um, old letters?

14:33.429 --> 14:36.279
Testimonials dating back 
to BrotherJerome's time?

14:36.279 --> 14:39.873
Uh, yes. Uh, 
most were 19th century.

14:39.873 --> 14:43.307
As for these, they were 
written by the same person.

14:43.307 --> 14:47.745
The... The dotting of the "I's" 
and the speed of the pen stroke.

14:47.745 --> 14:49.183
That's what Bennett told us.

14:49.183 --> 14:51.850
He also said that 
the samples were identical.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.445
You know,

14:53.445 --> 14:55.806
I really do believe that, um,

14:55.806 --> 14:57.833
there's a problem 
between you and Sullivan.

14:57.833 --> 15:01.509
Yeah, he told us he didn't trust anyone 
but Bennett to handle the documents.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.465
What'd you do,
drop a jelly doughnut on 'em?

15:03.465 --> 15:05.362
I didn't do anything.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.805
It... It's those two...
Richard and Sean Sullivan.

15:08.805 --> 15:12.740
Two months ago 
I authenticated this letter.

15:12.740 --> 15:16.960
It's dated 1877...
from a Reverend...

15:16.960 --> 15:22.139
Jacob Spencer to his daughter Gracelyn,
telling her about Brother Jerome's healings.

15:22.139 --> 15:23.894
"Jerome is Thomas Ketcham's cousin,

15:23.894 --> 15:26.643
and he said he was in 
the woods along the Bronx River...

15:26.643 --> 15:28.701
"and God told him to use the oil.

15:28.701 --> 15:32.222
"Now people are coming from all 
over after hearing about the blessed oil.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.936
I have seen it with my own eyes."

15:33.936 --> 15:35.230
Then, last month,

15:35.230 --> 15:38.646
Sean Sullivan came to me 
with an envelope to authenticate.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.005
It's also dated 1877.

15:41.005 --> 15:42.861
But the envelope doesn't 
belong to the letter?

15:42.861 --> 15:48.345
No. The thing is, normally 
they ask me to go to their offices to work.

15:48.345 --> 15:51.378
Sean brought the envelope here.

15:52.605 --> 15:55.756
He didn't want his father 
to know what he was doing?

15:56.630 --> 15:59.913
Um, this missing letter...

15:59.913 --> 16:01.558
Do you have any idea what it was?

16:01.558 --> 16:03.737
He wouldn't tell me.

16:04.266 --> 16:05.865
It was authentic.

16:05.865 --> 16:06.836
I couldn't very well lie.

16:06.836 --> 16:08.976
I knew Louise Politano.

16:08.976 --> 16:10.812
She was not a liar.

16:10.812 --> 16:13.252
Dad, there's no use blaming James.

16:13.252 --> 16:17.099
I know how upsetting this must be.
It's the last thing you needed.

16:17.099 --> 16:23.024
The city's only paying me the minimum fee, 
so I have to charge you for the balance.

16:26.541 --> 16:31.957
So they steered the police to 
one authenticator instead of another.

16:31.957 --> 16:34.537
You're reading too much into it.

16:34.537 --> 16:35.661
At the very least, Your Honor,

16:35.661 --> 16:39.650
it appears they steered the police away 
from a controversy withintheir foundation.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.255
This is a charity that helps little sick kids.

16:42.255 --> 16:46.369
A sainthood would enhance 
the influence and the prestige...

16:46.369 --> 16:48.406
of Richard Sullivan's foundation.

16:48.406 --> 16:51.702
He has a motive to get rid 
of any impediment, Your Honor.

16:53.791 --> 16:55.487
You have no right.

16:55.487 --> 16:57.605
We haven't done anything wrong.

16:58.978 --> 17:00.272
Careful!

17:00.386 --> 17:02.370
Those documents are irreplaceable!

17:02.370 --> 17:06.351
We'll be careful. Now, if you don't mind, sir,
you'll have to wait outside.

17:06.883 --> 17:09.223
Here's the file on Louise.

17:09.223 --> 17:11.883
Here's her medical chart...

17:11.883 --> 17:16.194
with the diagnosis 
of paralytic poliomyelitis.

17:16.194 --> 17:19.858
Statements from two doctors 
attesting to her complete recovery.

17:19.858 --> 17:25.588
I don't see anything here contradicting 
the claim of a miraculous cure.

17:25.959 --> 17:30.536
Oh, this is the envelope
that Sean had authenticated.

17:30.646 --> 17:33.531
This is the letter they 
don't want anyone to see.

17:33.531 --> 17:36.671
It's from Thomas Ketcham,
BrotherJerome's cousin.

17:36.671 --> 17:39.497
"I heard Jerome has a magic oil."

17:39.497 --> 17:44.276
"He was in the woods along 
the Bronx River when he came upon...

17:44.608 --> 17:46.748
a goat."

17:46.748 --> 17:51.590
"The goat rose up and walked 
on two legs like a man does walk."

17:51.590 --> 17:53.658
"Jerome said the goat 
had much conversation...

17:53.658 --> 17:58.225
and told him of a magic remedy 
from the oil in the lamps at the church."

17:58.225 --> 18:00.389
A talking goat?

18:02.626 --> 18:04.566
A goat who walks like a man.

18:05.255 --> 18:10.607
Brother Jerome told his cousin 
his best ideas came from... the devil.

18:10.607 --> 18:12.783
A secret worth protecting.

18:12.783 --> 18:17.674
This becomes known, the foundation 
might as well hang up its donation plate.

18:22.699 --> 18:25.579
I don't know what 
the goat letter means,

18:25.579 --> 18:28.209
but at the very least,
we should have told the archdiocese.

18:28.209 --> 18:30.308
What does your father think it means?

18:30.308 --> 18:32.979
He thinks the letter was 
sent to test our faith.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.384
But he's afraid that his...

18:35.384 --> 18:37.749
life's work's been in 
the name of a charlatan.

18:37.749 --> 18:42.069
I keep telling him our life's work is 
in the name of those we help...

18:42.069 --> 18:45.495
the cancer kids,
the AIDS babies.

18:45.495 --> 18:49.331
But he's turned 
the foundation into a kind of...

18:49.331 --> 18:52.878
cult of personality.

18:52.878 --> 18:56.727
If Louise Politano, uh,

18:56.727 --> 18:59.952
admitted her prank,
it would all unravel.

18:59.952 --> 19:02.414
He didn't know she lied.

19:02.414 --> 19:05.134
How could he?
Look at the doctors' reports.

19:05.134 --> 19:07.654
You haven't answered the question.

19:07.654 --> 19:10.698
My father wouldn't hurt anyone.

19:10.698 --> 19:13.303
He's not that kind of man.

19:13.303 --> 19:17.136
And if he was, he would have 
destroyed the goat letter. He hasn't.

19:17.136 --> 19:18.169
That's a...

19:18.169 --> 19:20.069
Good point.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.959
Um, are you familiar 
with Louise's file?

19:22.959 --> 19:24.755
Yes, I prepared it.

19:24.755 --> 19:29.668
The doctor made a notation here during 
an examination a month after her recovery...

19:29.668 --> 19:33.114
about a fractured left scaphoid.

19:33.646 --> 19:35.463
- She broke her wrist.
- Yes.

19:35.463 --> 19:39.682
She went skating too soon after her cure,
and her legs weren't strong enough.

19:39.682 --> 19:41.418
She fell down.

19:42.815 --> 19:47.797
Louise's note to Mary Carnahan 
admitting the prank was dated...

19:47.797 --> 19:51.969
four weeks after her... cure.

19:55.758 --> 19:58.738
- She's left-handed.
- She wrote a note with a broken wrist.

19:58.738 --> 20:00.207
Another miracle.

20:00.207 --> 20:05.520
The note is a forgery. / Which somehow 
made its way into the Carnahan archive.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.957
I'm betting that wasn't a miracle.

20:09.684 --> 20:13.302
This is everyone who accessed 
the Carnahan archives in the last year.

20:13.302 --> 20:14.597
Eight names.

20:14.597 --> 20:18.724
Doctoral students and professors...
all with proper accreditation.

20:18.724 --> 20:20.381
Uh, do you know who, uh,

20:20.381 --> 20:23.996
moved the humidity recorder here 
by the Carnahan archives?

20:23.996 --> 20:26.516
A technician came by last month.

20:28.334 --> 20:30.471
The service log hasn't been signed.

20:30.471 --> 20:31.907
How long was he here?

20:31.907 --> 20:34.006
I think about half an hour.

20:34.397 --> 20:36.809
Your desk is right 
around the corner?

20:36.809 --> 20:38.775
L... I didn't think I had 
to keep an eye on him.

20:38.775 --> 20:41.376
He was just calibrating the machine.

20:41.376 --> 20:44.581
By putting it underneath the heating vent.

20:44.931 --> 20:50.053
The company that leases the machine says 
they haven't sent a technician out in two months.

20:50.053 --> 20:54.295
So this bogus repairman may 
have planted the bogus note?

20:54.295 --> 20:57.015
If the note was a fake,
then we're saying what?

20:57.015 --> 21:00.080
Louise's cure was the real thing?

21:00.311 --> 21:03.559
I guess that is what we're saying.

21:03.559 --> 21:08.270
There is no other evidence it wasn't.

21:08.270 --> 21:14.371
We were led to the note 
by Mary Carnahan's poem,

21:14.371 --> 21:17.925
which we thought was 
inspired by Louise's prank.

21:17.925 --> 21:20.044
But if there is no prank,

21:20.044 --> 21:22.867
then maybe the poem is a fake too.

21:22.867 --> 21:26.407
A lot of trouble just to keep 
Brother Jerome from becoming a saint.

21:26.407 --> 21:27.963
Maybe not so much trouble...

21:27.963 --> 21:31.348
if the target is the foundation itself,

21:32.482 --> 21:36.812
and the trail led us to the goat letter,

21:38.349 --> 21:42.303
Brother Jerome's fall from grace.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.516
I knew it!

21:45.516 --> 21:47.953
I knew Louise could not make that up.

21:47.953 --> 21:50.834
Well, you still have a bigger problem...
the goat letter.

21:50.834 --> 21:53.425
That's only a problem 
for those whose faith is weak.

21:53.425 --> 21:54.601
Like your son?

21:54.601 --> 21:57.995
Maybe he thought that the foundation 
was losing touch with its mission.

21:57.995 --> 22:01.054
He thought that exposing the goat 
letter would force a change.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.013
That's ridiculous.

22:03.013 --> 22:07.133
When Brother Jerome is canonized
later this year, my job will be done.

22:07.133 --> 22:09.651
I'm retiring.
Sean can run the foundation...

22:09.651 --> 22:13.668
from a shoe box in the Bronx 
if that's what he thinks is right.

22:13.668 --> 22:15.223
The goat letter...

22:15.223 --> 22:17.041
How did you acquire it?

22:17.041 --> 22:19.120
From a collector in North Carolina.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.566
The authenticator that you sent us to...

22:22.566 --> 22:24.302
James Bennett...

22:24.302 --> 22:25.798
He have anything to do with the letter?

22:25.798 --> 22:28.399
He brokered the purchase.

22:28.691 --> 22:30.931
You actually met the collector?

22:30.931 --> 22:33.511
No. James handled all that.

22:33.511 --> 22:37.711
He's helped us acquire over 
a dozen documents in the last few years.

22:37.711 --> 22:39.448
Funny he didn't mention that.

22:39.448 --> 22:44.717
James Bennett... He is someone that you trust?
He's a friend of the foundation?

22:44.717 --> 22:49.106
I've known him for years.
His mother is a longtime supporter.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.057
I don't know why 
you want to come here.

22:53.057 --> 22:56.463
- It's not our church.
- Closer to where I work.

22:59.407 --> 23:01.460
What happened to your watch?

23:03.663 --> 23:05.359
Mother.

23:06.250 --> 23:11.109
I gave it for a charity auction.
It was a nice watch. I still had the box.

23:11.109 --> 23:13.448
It was a special gift for you.

23:13.448 --> 23:15.407
Just for you.

23:15.801 --> 23:18.799
I told you I don't want anything.

23:18.799 --> 23:20.297
Good.

23:22.228 --> 23:23.422
Be right back.

23:28.335 --> 23:30.794
Bless me, Father, 
for I have sinned.

23:30.794 --> 23:32.791
But that's not why I'm here.

23:32.791 --> 23:36.246
- I know you speak with the archdiocese.
- What's on your mind?

23:36.246 --> 23:39.136
It's about the Brother Jerome Foundation.

23:39.136 --> 23:42.611
I know they have certain 
documents in their possession...

23:42.611 --> 23:48.947
documents that suggest that Brother Jerome 
was not unfamiliar with satanic magic.

23:50.183 --> 23:52.271
Bennett has a juvenile arrest record.

23:52.271 --> 23:55.714
We're working to get it unsealed, but 
we tracked down the cop who busted him.

23:55.714 --> 24:00.872
Bennett used home-brewed thermite 
to melt the glass in a store window.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.342
Home-brewed.

24:02.342 --> 24:03.794
Boy chemist.

24:03.794 --> 24:08.973
Yeah, someone who might have had the bright idea 
to use a balloon filled with lye as a murder weapon.

24:08.973 --> 24:12.064
What do we know 
about this goat letter?

24:12.064 --> 24:14.688
It was authenticated 
by the expert at Bartleby's.

24:14.688 --> 24:16.015
We tried to track down the collector,

24:16.015 --> 24:19.363
but the trail dead-ended 
at a P.O. Box in Fayetteville.

24:19.363 --> 24:22.679
If Bennett wanted the world 
to know about this goat letter...

24:22.679 --> 24:26.629
and embarrass the foundation,
why not just call the papers?

24:26.629 --> 24:28.620
That would call attention to himself.

24:28.620 --> 24:31.920
This goat letter probably 
came from Bennett's pen.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.015
And... And this other letter...

24:34.015 --> 24:37.604
uh, the one about God telling 
Jerome to use the lamp oil.

24:37.604 --> 24:42.035
Now, Bennett sold the foundation 
16 documents... probably all fake...

24:42.035 --> 24:46.579
all building up to this goat letter,
the disgracing of Brother Jerome.

24:46.579 --> 24:51.547
To make these forgeries, he'd have 
to use materials from different centuries,

24:51.547 --> 24:53.780
to write in the style of the period.

24:53.780 --> 24:59.186
And immerse himself in the mind 
of a 19th-century minister...

24:59.186 --> 25:00.898
writing to his daughter,

25:00.898 --> 25:05.848
of a... a 15-year-old girl worried 
about telling a lie and...

25:05.848 --> 25:08.604
a... a 30-year-old poet.

25:08.604 --> 25:14.037
And compose an original 
poem true to her style.

25:14.288 --> 25:15.880
He'd have to be good.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.475
Yeah, not just good.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.491
Extraordinary.

25:24.902 --> 25:28.728
And for paper, your guy 
Bennett probably used blank pages...

25:28.728 --> 25:30.960
ripped from 19th-century books.

25:30.960 --> 25:35.229
And by burning old paper 
and mixing the ashes with the ink,

25:35.229 --> 25:37.603
he was able to trick 
the carbon dating.

25:37.603 --> 25:38.613
Impressive.

25:38.613 --> 25:41.148
More impressive is 
what he did with the writing.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.688
I mean, forgers usually 
write in short bursts...

25:43.688 --> 25:46.213
with pauses to look 
at the handwriting they're imitating.

25:46.213 --> 25:47.422
But not Bennett.

25:47.422 --> 25:50.825
No. Once he starts to write,
he never pauses.

25:50.825 --> 25:54.269
There's no disfluency.
The writing is natural, relaxed.

25:54.269 --> 25:56.122
It's like he's in a trance.

25:56.122 --> 25:59.198
He became Thomas Ketcham,
Mary Carnahan.

25:59.198 --> 26:01.471
I did find one inconsistency.

26:01.471 --> 26:05.289
Several pen strokes have this smudge.

26:05.289 --> 26:07.062
From a left-handed writer.

26:07.062 --> 26:08.453
Which your guy is.

26:08.453 --> 26:14.024
Now, true writing samples from Mary Carnahan 
and Thomas Ketcham show right-handed smudges,

26:14.024 --> 26:17.289
but it's not enough for me 
to declare these forgeries.

26:19.766 --> 26:23.782
Any evidence Bennett's forged anything 
besides the Brother Jerome documents?

26:23.782 --> 26:25.200
If he did, he's been giving them away.

26:25.200 --> 26:30.714
We found two bank accounts in his name...
with balances totaling $132,000.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.517
Small money considering 
what you can get for a...

26:33.517 --> 26:35.031
Abe Lincoln letter.

26:35.031 --> 26:36.283
Bennett can't be all bad.

26:36.283 --> 26:39.990
He put his mom as a signatory on his accounts 
in case something happens to him.

26:39.990 --> 26:44.215
Nothing will happen to him if we can't 
even make a case against him for fraud.

26:44.886 --> 26:47.179
High school transcripts...

26:47.989 --> 26:51.374
have him excelling 
at history, chemistry, art.

26:51.374 --> 26:53.067
Useful skills for a forger.

26:53.067 --> 26:54.340
His grades...

26:54.340 --> 26:55.829
Straight "A's" at midterm.

26:55.829 --> 27:00.148
A few months later..."C's," "D's."

27:00.148 --> 27:03.123
His attendance record is erratic.

27:03.123 --> 27:05.293
Maybe he had 
a chronic medical problem.

27:05.293 --> 27:08.639
A social worker made 
a visit to his home.

27:08.639 --> 27:10.883
The furnishings were missing.

27:12.455 --> 27:14.428
TV.

27:14.739 --> 27:17.093
Stereo was gone.

27:17.204 --> 27:19.156
Chaotic home life.

27:24.770 --> 27:26.042
You know, his juvie file...

27:26.042 --> 27:29.618
It shows that he was arrested 
at 13 for breaking into a thrift store.

27:32.574 --> 27:34.348
Look whose store it was.

27:35.078 --> 27:37.283
Brother Jerome's Thrift Shop
Bronx, New York
monday, March 1

27:37.283 --> 27:41.460
James was caught stealing 
an electroplating kit...

27:41.460 --> 27:43.823
his mother Betty had donated.

27:43.823 --> 27:45.875
He said it was his,

27:45.875 --> 27:48.568
and his mom 
gave it away by mistake.

27:48.568 --> 27:52.993
His mother do that a lot...
Uh, donate things?

27:52.993 --> 27:54.545
Mmm, yes.

27:54.545 --> 28:00.386
Every few months she'd bring in,
uh, clothing, toys, furnishings.

28:00.386 --> 28:02.158
Did she say where she got them?

28:02.158 --> 28:03.950
Well, we assumed...

28:03.950 --> 28:07.125
she got them from her neighborhood.

28:07.616 --> 28:08.948
She was tireless.

28:08.948 --> 28:12.529
I bet she got special recognition 
for her tireless work.

28:12.529 --> 28:15.380
From Mr. Sullivan himself.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.505
And what did James 
think of all this, uh, giving?

28:18.505 --> 28:21.981
Well, after his little incident,

28:21.981 --> 28:25.796
I think he was moved 
by the spirit of Brother Jerome.

28:25.796 --> 28:30.003
He started bringing in 
rare coins he found.

28:30.003 --> 28:32.406
One of our volunteers 
said they were valuable...

28:32.406 --> 28:34.457
"D" series or something like that.

28:34.457 --> 28:39.361
Anyway. But James traded them 
for a radio or a bicycle.

28:39.361 --> 28:41.202
The coins were worth 
a lot more than that.

28:41.202 --> 28:42.833
Oh, yes.

28:42.833 --> 28:45.317
We sold them for hundreds of dollars.

28:45.317 --> 28:49.503
It was a great gift 
from such a young man.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.346
Great gift.

28:52.346 --> 28:55.583
Thanks to the electroplating kit.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.202
Apartment of James & Elizabeth Bennett
125 Clington Street
Tuseday, March 2

29:00.202 --> 29:04.338
James is at work right now.
I don't know when he'll be back.

29:04.338 --> 29:06.307
I like the way you keep your home.

29:06.877 --> 29:08.970
You know, it's so, um,

29:08.970 --> 29:12.166
clean and efficient.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.997
There's no clutter.

29:13.997 --> 29:16.733
I don't like keeping a lot of things.

29:16.733 --> 29:19.531
What about James?
Does he hate clutter too?

29:19.531 --> 29:22.804
Him? He is a clutter bug.

29:22.804 --> 29:27.492
Inez at the thrift shop said over the years 
you've donated a lot of things.

29:27.492 --> 29:30.069
Things we didn't need.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.278
Even James's toys?

29:33.068 --> 29:34.931
He couldn't have been
very happy about that.

29:34.931 --> 29:38.747
We all had to give up things we love.

29:38.747 --> 29:41.429
You gave it all to 
the Brother Jerome Foundation?

29:41.429 --> 29:44.844
Yes. Everything.

29:44.844 --> 29:49.170
It is such a good feeling.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.454
It's like a dark cloud 
being lifted, isn't it?

29:53.404 --> 29:54.535
Yes.

29:54.535 --> 29:58.347
'Cause, uh, weeks before,

29:58.498 --> 30:02.801
you're very sad 'cause y
ou're thinking about all the...

30:02.960 --> 30:04.855
the sick kids...

30:04.855 --> 30:06.507
and how you could help them.

30:06.507 --> 30:10.705
You would be surprised 
how many there are.

30:12.155 --> 30:14.108
You have lovely hands.

30:16.102 --> 30:20.006
They're beautiful, aren't they?
They're so pale and perfect.

30:22.240 --> 30:26.885
Those are exactly 
the words that James used.

30:26.885 --> 30:32.164
He wrote me a little card for Mother's Day 
when he was a teenager.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.855
Do you still have it?

30:34.125 --> 30:36.477
I don't have time to look for it.

30:36.477 --> 30:39.310
I have errands to run.

30:41.846 --> 30:43.457
You know, I'm...

30:43.457 --> 30:47.349
I'm surprised, uh, 
with all the money that he has that...

30:47.349 --> 30:50.692
that James didn't, um,
donate more money to the foundation.

30:50.692 --> 30:54.032
What money?
We barely get by on what James makes.

30:54.032 --> 30:57.486
Well, actually,
he has quite a lot put aside.

30:57.976 --> 31:02.830
Well, he has over 130,000 
in his accounts.

31:02.830 --> 31:04.721
My Lord.

31:06.882 --> 31:09.906
That's, uh, your money too.

31:10.138 --> 31:11.946
You're a signatory on those accounts.

31:11.946 --> 31:13.296
I am?

31:13.296 --> 31:17.130
Yes. Thank you, Mrs. Bennett.
It's been nice meeting you.

31:20.300 --> 31:22.272
What do you mean 
it's out of your hands?

31:22.272 --> 31:24.182
Richard Sullivan told me to talk to you.

31:24.182 --> 31:27.998
I'm sure he explained to you the foundation's 
under investigation for fraud,

31:27.998 --> 31:29.647
and their accounts have been frozen.

31:29.647 --> 31:32.810
But not before they deposited 
the check my mother wrote them!

31:32.810 --> 31:35.081
$130,000!

31:35.081 --> 31:39.268
- That's all the money we have!
- I'm sorry, but until we finish our audit...

31:39.268 --> 31:41.880
This is how charity is rewarded?

31:42.951 --> 31:45.663
Thank you very much for your help.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.771
It still astounds me 
she gutted his accounts.

31:51.771 --> 31:55.816
It's a manic-depressive behavior 
that she can't resist.

31:55.816 --> 32:00.462
Well, let's hope Mr. Bennett 
performs to your expectations.

32:04.549 --> 32:08.306
We had so much money,
and they needed it.

32:08.306 --> 32:10.920
I don't want to talk right now.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.791
I'm very angry.

32:12.791 --> 32:14.182
You'll get over it.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.214
You always do.

33:07.042 --> 33:11.637
Not only does Brother Jerome accept 
Ketcham's apology for spreading that rumor,

33:11.637 --> 33:13.829
he even forgives him.

33:13.829 --> 33:16.522
And it's from the same 
collector in North Carolina?

33:16.522 --> 33:20.819
Yes. I know that seems fortuitous,
but that's how it is sometimes.

33:21.773 --> 33:25.484
All right. I'll send it 
to Devlin for authentication.

33:25.484 --> 33:26.954
I've already verified it.

33:26.954 --> 33:28.745
If I were you, 
I wouldn't wait too long.

33:28.745 --> 33:33.047
If Devlin is satisfied,
I'll have a check for you by the afternoon.

33:34.161 --> 33:35.831
Tomorrow afternoon then.

33:46.101 --> 33:49.572
Hi. Oh, we're not 
interrupting dinner, are we?

33:49.572 --> 33:52.985
- Hi, Mrs. Bennett. How are you?
- I'm all right, Detective. Come in.

33:52.985 --> 33:54.019
You know these people?

33:54.019 --> 33:56.251
We stopped by a couple days ago.

33:56.601 --> 34:00.098
Why didn't you tell me? / You were 
already so upset about the money.

34:00.098 --> 34:02.890
Scrabble.
I love Scrabble.

34:03.222 --> 34:06.333
- Who's winning?
- James. He's a very good player.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.662
What... What do you people want?

34:07.662 --> 34:10.456
Oh, we need your help 
with a document.

34:10.456 --> 34:13.358
- You mind if we set up here?
- What document?

34:13.358 --> 34:14.476
An old letter.

34:14.476 --> 34:21.092
Mr. Sullivan sent it this morning 
to Blaine Devlin at Bartleby's for authentication.

34:21.092 --> 34:24.351
Mr. Devlin had problems with it,
so he called us.

34:24.351 --> 34:25.882
He called you?

34:25.882 --> 34:27.851
Yeah, we have friends everywhere.

34:30.034 --> 34:33.277
Do you think you could find that 
Mother's Day card you told us about?

34:33.277 --> 34:36.858
If it's anywhere, it's in 
a big box I keep in my closet.

34:36.858 --> 34:38.678
- Let me help you.
- What are you looking for?

34:38.678 --> 34:43.521
This letter written by Brother Jerome...
Mr. Devlin says he thinks it's a fake.

34:43.521 --> 34:46.274
- He what?
- He thinks it's a fake.

34:46.408 --> 34:49.880
Mr. Sullivan told him 
he got the letter from you.

34:49.969 --> 34:53.344
Actually, a collector put this up for sale.
I'm just brokering the transaction.

34:53.344 --> 34:55.576
You can just put it on the table.

34:55.728 --> 34:58.599
And I thought that
James was the clutter bug.

34:58.599 --> 35:00.200
Maybe we should 
talk to the collector.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.092
No. I've done business 
with him for years.

35:02.092 --> 35:04.391
There's no doubt this is 
Brother Jerome's handwriting.

35:04.391 --> 35:06.802
The paper is right... and the ink.

35:06.802 --> 35:08.371
Did you try carbon-dating the ink?

35:08.371 --> 35:11.113
That wasn't Devlin's problem.
What are these?

35:11.113 --> 35:14.629
Those are thank-you letters 
from the foundation.

35:14.629 --> 35:16.619
This was Devlin's problem here...

35:16.619 --> 35:21.298
These microscopic
left-to-right smudges.

35:21.298 --> 35:23.780
He says it's from a left-handed writer.

35:23.780 --> 35:25.742
Brother Jerome was right-handed,
wasn't he?

35:25.742 --> 35:29.423
Yes, he was.
These smudges don't prove anything.

35:29.423 --> 35:33.319
This is it.
It is such a beautiful poem.

35:34.591 --> 35:40.288
"Mother with hands...
pale and perfect forming the future."

35:41.118 --> 35:43.587
It is so beautiful.

35:43.897 --> 35:46.369
So beautiful that, uh,

35:46.369 --> 35:50.145
he used it in another poem.

35:51.495 --> 35:53.645
"Hands pale and perfect."

35:53.645 --> 35:56.173
No, no. That... 
That's not James's handwriting.

35:56.173 --> 35:58.824
We're supposed to think 
it was written by somebody else,

35:58.824 --> 36:02.754
except it has the same 
left-to-right smudges.

36:02.754 --> 36:07.197
And the 16 documents 
that you sold the foundation...

36:07.197 --> 36:10.736
Every one of them 
with the same smudge pattern.

36:11.826 --> 36:14.059
All fakes.

36:16.993 --> 36:18.704
Brilliant fakes.

36:21.479 --> 36:25.522
What are they accusing you of?
That you tried to cheat the foundation?

36:25.522 --> 36:26.914
I don't know 
what they're talking about.

36:26.914 --> 36:28.381
What he's been doing...

36:28.381 --> 36:34.299
almost as long as you've been 
devastating his home with your generosity.

36:34.299 --> 36:38.264
He used his electroplating set to 
change the mintmarks on coins...

36:38.264 --> 36:41.095
to make them seem rare and valuable.

36:41.095 --> 36:43.707
He brought them to the thrift store.

36:44.617 --> 36:49.615
Yeah, he bought back his bicycle 
and his radio.

36:50.225 --> 36:53.564
Everything that you 
gave away of his.

36:53.564 --> 36:55.845
Is this true, James?

36:55.845 --> 36:56.934
I don't remember.

36:56.934 --> 37:00.296
Oh, come on. Even now you can't tell her 
how much you hated what she did?

37:00.296 --> 37:03.486
She took away 
your stability and safety.

37:03.486 --> 37:05.956
Everything that made a home.

37:05.956 --> 37:08.069
It's ancient history.

37:09.480 --> 37:12.953
Your, uh, report cards.

37:13.483 --> 37:16.416
Uh, attendance.

37:16.416 --> 37:20.737
"A chronic under achiever."

37:20.737 --> 37:22.786
He was a lazy boy.

37:23.078 --> 37:26.653
It is normal for boys to be lazy.

37:28.445 --> 37:30.517
Hey, is...

37:30.831 --> 37:34.631
Is this why you can't 
bring yourself to blame her?

37:36.182 --> 37:40.537
Is this why instead you go after the ones 
who encouraged her, who enabled her?

37:42.126 --> 37:49.357
Is that why you spent 20 years 
entangling them in a web of forgery,

37:49.987 --> 37:52.297
priming them for the kill?

37:52.966 --> 37:56.652
Every single one of 
those documents is authentic.

38:00.776 --> 38:02.648
Even this one?

38:03.932 --> 38:07.249
This is from Brother Jerome's cousin.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.609
"Jerome said the goat...

38:10.609 --> 38:13.591
"had much conversation 
and told him of a magic remedy...

38:13.591 --> 38:16.563
from the oil in the lamps at the church."

38:17.472 --> 38:18.804
A goat?

38:18.804 --> 38:24.362
"The goat rose up and walked 
on two legs like a man does walk."

38:24.693 --> 38:26.701
What do you suppose that means?

38:28.113 --> 38:30.946
It's obvious, isn't it?
That's the devil.

38:33.036 --> 38:35.927
Where did you get such an evil letter?

38:36.078 --> 38:37.688
It doesn't matter.

38:38.258 --> 38:39.567
No.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.289
It matters what Richard 
Sullivan did with it.

38:45.764 --> 38:48.477
Come on. I mean,

38:48.648 --> 38:51.588
you didn't really think 
he would make it public?

38:51.999 --> 38:53.948
That hypocrite!

38:54.841 --> 38:56.979
It would have been 
the ethical thing to do.

38:56.979 --> 38:58.869
You were counting on Sean.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.519
And he couldn't prevail on his father.

39:01.691 --> 39:04.001
Louise Politano...

39:04.001 --> 39:05.632
became a martyr to your needs.

39:05.632 --> 39:07.542
I didn't have anything to do with that!

39:07.542 --> 39:12.413
No. You left it to, um,
"divine providence."

39:13.362 --> 39:18.256
Maybe the lye would kill her,
maybe it would injure her.

39:18.256 --> 39:19.547
Or maybe it would just startle her.

39:19.547 --> 39:24.294
Either way, the trail would lead back 
to the poem and Brother Jerome.

39:24.294 --> 39:27.051
And that's where 
you showed your hand.

39:29.944 --> 39:33.226
"The Deceit of Nature."

39:33.437 --> 39:38.384
You used a poem that 
you wrote about your mother.

39:38.435 --> 39:41.086
In your heart,

39:42.395 --> 39:48.001
you know, turned 
your young life into chaos.

39:48.052 --> 39:54.025
Tell me this isn't true, James.

39:55.194 --> 39:58.936
The devil didn't talk 
to Brother Jerome, did he?

40:03.146 --> 40:05.354
I made it up, Mom.

40:06.425 --> 40:08.296
All the letters.

40:10.857 --> 40:14.878
Brother Jerome is just 
what you always thought he was.

40:16.790 --> 40:18.440
Why?

40:18.440 --> 40:21.411
They took advantage of you!

40:22.241 --> 40:26.384
You are nothing 
but a common criminal.

40:27.432 --> 40:31.772
No, there's nothing...
common about your son.

40:31.772 --> 40:33.923
Or his crime.

40:36.858 --> 40:39.248
No, you fooled experts.

40:41.340 --> 40:42.911
That's right.

40:42.911 --> 40:45.923
Because I'm brilliant at what I do.

40:46.432 --> 40:47.983
Hey.

40:50.817 --> 40:52.167
Show her.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.679
Mom, watch.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.307
Brother Jerome.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.131
Thomas Jefferson.

41:11.101 --> 41:14.856
Mickey Mantle.

41:14.856 --> 41:17.728
Edgar Allan Poe.

41:20.882 --> 41:24.916
Elizabeth Bennett.

41:25.485 --> 41:27.696
You, Mom.

41:28.446 --> 41:31.812
The first signature I learned.

41:32.124 --> 41:35.717
My goodness, that is my signature.

41:35.847 --> 41:38.230
It's perfect.

41:39.399 --> 41:41.452
They're all perfect.

41:43.363 --> 41:45.526
She took everything away from you.

41:48.198 --> 41:51.019
Everything that you loved.

41:51.108 --> 41:53.791
But she gave you this.

41:54.702 --> 41:56.610
She gave you the...

41:56.610 --> 41:59.945
the drive to develop this skill.

42:02.942 --> 42:04.272
Yes.

42:05.063 --> 42:07.154
And the venom to use it.

42:09.506 --> 42:11.036
Use it to cheat.

42:14.913 --> 42:16.522
And to kill.

42:19.035 --> 42:20.605
She gave you that.

42:26.086 --> 42:27.616
Yes, Mother.

42:31.472 --> 42:33.223
That's what you gave me.

42:37.117 --> 42:39.646
We're putting you 
under arrest, James.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.717
If anybody needed a miracle...

43:01.717 --> 43:06.131
she worshipped a saint 
and raised a sinner.

43:06.739 --> 43:09.273
The sinner raised himself.
