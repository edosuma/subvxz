<i>Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...</i>

00:02.211 --> 00:05.580
Silas wants me to drop the veil
between our side and the other side.

00:05.580 --> 00:07.216
You will open
the floodgates

00:07.217 --> 00:08.699
for every supernatural being
that has ever died ?

00:08.700 --> 00:10.177
It's done. The veil is down.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.470
Hey.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.970
Who the hell is that?

00:13.972 --> 00:15.139
That is my ex-boyfriend Alexander.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.268
We should get out of here.

00:17.676 --> 00:20.010
You should...
Too bad you can't

00:20.012 --> 00:21.061
Silas?

00:21.063 --> 00:24.148
I can make you see
whatever I want you to see.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.485
You have no idea who I am.

00:27.486 --> 00:30.387
I will make your
body turn to stone.

00:30.388 --> 00:31.772
Isn't she your girlfriend?

00:31.773 --> 00:33.469
Who knows?
I know she was sired to me,

00:33.470 --> 00:34.609
I know her emotions were off.

00:34.610 --> 00:36.405
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

00:36.406 --> 00:37.445
Get the girl.

00:37.446 --> 00:39.646
I can bring Jeremy back.
I can keep him here!

00:39.648 --> 00:40.916
No, you can't.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.033
Phasmatos, raverus un animun.

00:45.453 --> 00:48.038
Oh, my God.
I'm dead.

Welcome back.

01:07.833 --> 01:11.434
It was our deaths that allowed
this day to come to pass,

01:11.436 --> 01:15.701
massacres performed in the name
of resurrecting the immortal Silas.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.093
12 hybrids, 12 witches,

01:19.094 --> 01:20.998
the slaughter of innocents
by the so-called

01:21.164 --> 01:24.848
hero protectors of Mystic Falls.

01:24.850 --> 01:26.967
They risked unleashing
hell on earth

01:26.968 --> 01:28.755
for their own selfish gains,

01:31.440 --> 01:33.635
and today...

01:33.801 --> 01:35.826
That's exactly what
they're going to get.

01:58.349 --> 02:02.770
Damon, help me celebrate
my 17th High School graduation.

02:02.771 --> 02:04.959
Hey. You remember
my friend Lexi of course.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.023
Lexi back from the dead.

02:07.025 --> 02:09.193
Goodie.

02:09.193 --> 02:11.993
- What's up, buzz kill?
- Stefan, you just gonna sit there

02:11.994 --> 02:14.014
and let her enact
her ghostly revenge?

02:14.015 --> 02:15.344
You reap what you sow, buddy.

02:15.784 --> 02:18.486
Let's be very clear.
Whatever time I have left here

02:18.487 --> 02:20.871
I sure as hell don't plan
on wasting on you.

02:20.872 --> 02:24.324
- Got me?
- Yeah. Got you.

02:26.327 --> 02:29.029
So if you and Ric
and little Gilbert

02:29.030 --> 02:31.664
are all flesh-like
and real-seeming,

02:31.666 --> 02:33.366
that means something
went horribly wrong

02:33.368 --> 02:34.667
when Bonnie tried
to put that veil up,

02:34.669 --> 02:38.255
and you two are having
"dance party U.S.A."

02:38.256 --> 02:40.174
You're right.
How selfish of me

02:40.175 --> 02:41.926
to be indulging in
these precious moments

02:41.927 --> 02:43.727
with my formerly dead best friend.

02:43.728 --> 02:46.480
I should be sacrificing
my own happiness

02:46.481 --> 02:48.649
for the good of others, right?

02:48.650 --> 02:51.718
I should be upstairs
grooming my hero hair.

02:51.719 --> 02:55.072
- Are you drunk?
- I don't know, mom am I?

02:55.073 --> 02:57.010
Ha ha ha!

02:57.761 --> 02:59.160
Ok.

02:59.161 --> 03:00.611
Well, I guess that's
one way to celebrate

03:00.612 --> 03:03.613
our supernatural apocalypse.

03:03.615 --> 03:07.394
Now care to hazard any guesses
on what the hell went wrong?

03:07.395 --> 03:09.286
I hit kind of snag.

03:09.287 --> 03:12.673
A snag?
A snag is a bad yearbook picture.

03:12.674 --> 03:14.674
You hit a Tsunami.
Where are you?

03:14.676 --> 03:16.988
Trying to fix it.
I'm running into some trouble.

03:17.546 --> 03:18.963
I need to wait
until the full moon tonight

03:18.964 --> 03:20.659
to have enough power
to put the veil back up.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.583
Are you telling me
that we might graduate

03:22.584 --> 03:24.218
right smack in the middle

03:24.219 --> 03:27.020
of a ghost-filled
expression triangle?

03:29.924 --> 03:33.044
- Maybe we should just cancel.
- No! We are not going to cancel.

03:33.045 --> 03:35.796
Graduation is the most
important event of our lives,

03:35.797 --> 03:37.664
the last ceremony of our youth.

03:37.665 --> 03:40.220
It is our rite of freaking passage!

03:40.386 --> 03:43.056
Hell will freeze over before
I let anyone cancel graduation.

03:43.222 --> 03:45.839
Can you not make jokes
about hell freezing over?

03:45.840 --> 03:48.142
We're not that far off
from that already.

03:48.143 --> 03:50.606
Just promise that today is
a friend day.

03:51.029 --> 03:54.849
Ok. I promise.

03:54.850 --> 03:56.117
I love you.

03:56.118 --> 03:57.404
I love you, too.

03:59.870 --> 04:03.702
Go. I'll make sure no one
finds your body, but, Bonnie...

04:04.042 --> 04:05.910
I know. Ok?

04:05.911 --> 04:08.546
I know I need to tell them.
I just can't.

04:08.547 --> 04:09.960
They've been through
too much already.

04:09.961 --> 04:13.337
I know child.
I was just going to say that

04:13.701 --> 04:16.887
make sure you say your good-byes.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.802
- Oh, my God.
- Mmm!

04:22.803 --> 04:24.544
No grease on the other side, huh?

04:24.546 --> 04:26.847
You have no idea
how much I miss this

04:26.848 --> 04:28.549
and this.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.267
No. Hey, hey. Hey!

04:30.268 --> 04:33.821
She just got her humanity back.
Let her live a little.

04:33.822 --> 04:35.421
Hey. You wish.

04:35.422 --> 04:37.058
I'm dead. What are they gonna do,
throw me in juvie?

04:37.059 --> 04:39.743
Well, then at least you'd
have a place to live.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.959
You both suck.

04:42.823 --> 04:44.698
Hey!

04:44.699 --> 04:47.162
Well, there it is, that smile.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.916
I wasn't sure we were
gonna see that again.

04:54.341 --> 04:57.210
I did some pretty terrible things.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.966
Hey. No. No tears.

05:01.967 --> 05:04.768
If Caroline was right,
we only have until tonight.

05:04.769 --> 05:08.105
- We need a no crying rule.
- But the crying's good.

05:08.106 --> 05:10.024
It means that I'm finally
feeling something,

05:10.025 --> 05:12.258
and right now, I...

05:14.895 --> 05:18.235
I feel happy.

05:22.154 --> 05:23.993
It's the grill.
Must be Matt.

05:26.091 --> 05:28.625
Hey. You went awol this morning.
What happened?

05:28.627 --> 05:30.910
Hello, Elena.

05:30.911 --> 05:32.446
It's your dead friend Connor here.

05:32.447 --> 05:33.459
You remember me?

05:36.383 --> 05:39.840
A hidden compartment filled
with advanced weaponry.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.923
Man has evolved from his
days of throwing stones.

05:42.924 --> 05:44.592
There is nothing
we can do for you, Alexander.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.176
Please let us go.

05:46.178 --> 05:49.897
I'm not holding you here,
although I have a feeling

05:49.898 --> 05:53.099
that exploding contraption
will have a hard time parting

05:53.561 --> 05:56.315
- with your handsome friend intact.
- Just go, Rebekah. I'll be fine.

05:56.655 --> 05:59.590
I'm not leaving you.

05:59.591 --> 06:04.114
The soldier Connor found a way
to siphon venom from a werewolf.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.529
What do you want from us?

06:05.530 --> 06:07.326
To fulfill my destiny.

06:07.616 --> 06:09.033
The brotherhood of
hunters was created

06:09.034 --> 06:11.651
for one reason
and one reason alone.

06:13.319 --> 06:15.934
Vaughn.
Unh!

06:15.935 --> 06:17.282
Got a little message
for you, laddie,

06:17.283 --> 06:20.798
straight from the mouth
of the witch Qetsiyah.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.996
We want Silas,
and we want the cure.

06:22.997 --> 06:25.832
I don't know where they are,
so I guess I can't help you.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.801
Huh. Well, you know
who's gonna need some help?

06:27.802 --> 06:30.638
Grandma and grandpa Jones in town
for the big High School graduation

06:30.932 --> 06:33.190
along with auntie Sue
and Uncle Mark,

06:33.191 --> 06:34.942
matter of fact everybody
here at the mystic grill

06:34.943 --> 06:36.360
for graduation brunch.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.691
You either give me what I want,
or they die.

06:42.984 --> 06:46.787
Yeah. Borrowed it from
my jarhead friend Connor.

06:46.788 --> 06:48.038
Shoots wood like lead.

06:48.532 --> 06:50.975
Come on, man.
I didn't kill you.

06:50.976 --> 06:52.858
No, but you left in
that well on that island,

06:52.859 --> 06:53.971
where I starved to death.

06:53.972 --> 06:56.196
There I was, all alone
on the other side

06:56.197 --> 06:57.581
till Qetsiyah found me
and reminded me

06:57.582 --> 06:59.166
of me supernatural destiny...

06:59.460 --> 07:02.835
Cure Silas and then kill Silas,
end of story.

07:06.924 --> 07:08.553
Please don't hurt anyone.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.477
I'll find Silas,
and I'll get the cure.

07:10.478 --> 07:13.897
Good. Get it done.

07:13.898 --> 07:17.688
So you get off on
terrorizing innocent people?

07:18.270 --> 07:20.237
And who might you be?

07:20.238 --> 07:21.982
I'm the guy responsible for the
18-year-old you just threatened.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.359
Well, that 18-year-old snapped
my neck with her bare hands.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.196
I'm also the guy
who showed her how to do that.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.245
Heh heh. That's ironic.
You must not know

07:28.246 --> 07:31.165
a damn thing about fighting if you're
trying to intimidate a dead guy

07:31.166 --> 07:34.621
packing c-4.

07:34.903 --> 07:36.623
This is my bar, pal.

07:37.005 --> 07:39.459
Nobody's gonna blow it up.

07:51.446 --> 07:53.080
Go ahead, sweet Rebekah.

07:53.082 --> 07:55.819
Use your vampire powers
to whisk him away.

07:55.820 --> 07:59.323
I'm sure you can survive the blast
of 6 of these automobiles,

07:59.324 --> 08:01.940
- but can he?
- Just ignore him, all right?

08:02.106 --> 08:05.662
Just think about something
else like graduation.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.749
What are your plans,
college, travel?

08:09.238 --> 08:11.168
Just because I'm never
getting out of this town

08:11.491 --> 08:14.371
doesn't mean you
shouldn't see the world.

08:14.372 --> 08:15.913
It's just been settled.

08:16.079 --> 08:19.249
I'm gonna show you life
as you've only dreamt it.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.677
We'll start in Italy.

08:20.678 --> 08:23.837
There's a lovely little church
outside San Vittore in Brienno.

08:24.003 --> 08:27.517
Romantic spot,
popular for weddings.

08:27.518 --> 08:31.138
And then I'll show you the northern
lights in the springtime,

08:31.139 --> 08:33.857
the simatai gorge from atop
the great wall of China,

08:33.857 --> 08:36.309
every inch of the Louvre.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.397
China, Paris, northern lights.

08:40.398 --> 08:42.232
It's a date.

08:42.232 --> 08:44.691
We'll see it all when we're
done here because we can.

08:45.102 --> 08:47.037
We're alive.
We're not gonna be stuck

08:47.038 --> 08:49.873
as ghosts in misery
on the other side.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.107
All right.
You're done now.

08:58.215 --> 08:59.331
I got you.

09:04.388 --> 09:07.140
I don't think red's
really your color, Bon-Bon.

09:07.141 --> 09:08.725
And here I was hoping
the ghost of anyone

09:08.726 --> 09:11.395
- would have killed you already.
- Funny you should mention death

09:11.396 --> 09:12.979
because I'm here to
collect that immortality

09:12.980 --> 09:14.481
you've promised me.

09:14.482 --> 09:16.149
Funny you think you're
still going to get it.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.401
I told you Qetsiyah's
the only witch who knows

09:17.402 --> 09:18.769
the immortality spell.

09:18.770 --> 09:20.737
If she was a no-show,
you're out of luck.

09:20.738 --> 09:22.989
See? Here's the thing, Bonnie.

09:22.990 --> 09:25.809
I can't disagree with you because I
have been feeling out of luck lately,

09:25.810 --> 09:28.445
but you know who has
been getting all of my luck?

09:28.446 --> 09:31.448
My beloved doppelganger Elena.

09:31.449 --> 09:34.451
My shadow self is living
a better life than I am,

09:34.991 --> 09:36.576
so if I don't get that immortality,

09:36.742 --> 09:39.322
I may just have to get
rid of her altogether.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.666
Did you just threaten
my best friend?

09:43.211 --> 09:45.995
I can crush your skull
without even flinching.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.798
Go ahead.
Make your move.

09:58.109 --> 10:00.026
Hey.
Hey.

10:00.027 --> 10:03.395
So I think there's some stuff
you and I need to talk about.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.649
Yes, we do, but first...

10:13.874 --> 10:17.627
- Consider it a graduation present.
- Damon, I can't take that.

10:17.628 --> 10:22.666
Sure you can. Looks like it
might be cherry flavored.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.468
I'm not saying
that I don't want it.

10:24.469 --> 10:26.285
Obviously I want it,

10:26.287 --> 10:30.039
but that's the only one.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.341
There's only one cure,

10:31.881 --> 10:33.643
and the hunters have
made it pretty clear

10:33.644 --> 10:35.712
that they're willing to kill
everyone in Mystic Falls

10:35.713 --> 10:37.137
until they get it.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.434
Elena, take the damn thing.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.934
I want you to take it.

10:49.359 --> 10:51.776
I can't.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.916
Well, I guess that answers
the sire bond question.

10:57.401 --> 11:01.204
You gonna help a brother out,
or you just gonna lurk?

11:01.205 --> 11:04.207
Look, Elena.

11:04.208 --> 11:07.500
You're my sister, and I love you

11:07.666 --> 11:10.413
no matter what you choose.

11:10.414 --> 11:14.300
How is it even when you're dead
you're the bane of my existence?

11:14.302 --> 11:16.259
So the veil's down until tonight.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.588
He dies, goes to the other side,
and what...

11:18.886 --> 11:21.892
Comes back all over again?
How long does that take?

11:21.893 --> 11:25.028
What, they don't give you
a rule book over there?

11:25.029 --> 11:26.897
Ha ha.

11:26.898 --> 11:29.316
You know, you're
missing your chance

11:29.317 --> 11:32.319
to weigh in on the great
Elena Gilbert cure debate.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.871
What am I supposed to do,
tell it's her choice?

11:35.873 --> 11:39.242
Because that worked out so well.

11:39.243 --> 11:41.179
You know, it's funny.
Those to are in there

11:41.180 --> 11:44.297
arguing about how
to protect the world,

11:44.298 --> 11:47.384
and they have yet to
address their biggest issue.

11:47.385 --> 11:48.802
Enlighten me.

11:48.803 --> 11:52.005
Sire bond's gone.

11:52.006 --> 11:53.957
Elena's emotions are back.

11:53.958 --> 11:56.258
She finally knows
exactly how she feels.

11:56.424 --> 12:01.278
And what if whatever
she feels is for you?

12:05.352 --> 12:08.294
She's the love of my life.

12:09.290 --> 12:12.859
I'd go back to her in a heartbeat,

12:12.860 --> 12:16.413
but if that's not how she feels,

12:16.414 --> 12:17.948
then maybe that's exactly
what I need to hear

12:17.949 --> 12:20.584
to get my ass out the door.

12:20.585 --> 12:25.171
Maybe I will move to Australia.
I can live in a yurt.

12:25.172 --> 12:26.822
Cheers to that.

12:32.095 --> 12:33.697
Come on.
We don't need the cure for Silas.

12:33.881 --> 12:36.249
He's a calcified statue.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.018
Ugh.

12:38.019 --> 12:39.134
What was that?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.510
Nothing.

12:40.972 --> 12:42.305
Take off your shirt.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.774
Elena, there are children present.

12:44.775 --> 12:46.266
Fine.

12:48.979 --> 12:50.947
Damon, why isn't this healed?

12:50.948 --> 12:52.148
Because the bullet was laced

12:52.149 --> 12:53.533
with werewolf venom, ok?

12:53.534 --> 12:56.685
Hunters are dicks.

12:56.687 --> 12:59.072
We need Klaus.
We need his blood.

12:59.073 --> 13:00.540
Klaus would rather see me die.

13:00.541 --> 13:02.191
Plus Klaus is
a thousand miles away,

13:02.192 --> 13:04.127
sipping a hurricane
on Bourbon Street.

13:04.128 --> 13:08.130
- That wound will kill you.
- What about the cure?

13:11.701 --> 13:13.470
Jeremy's right.

13:13.471 --> 13:15.839
If you're human,
the werewolf venom won't hurt you.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.491
And here I was
so moved by your speech

13:17.492 --> 13:21.311
to save mankind.

13:21.842 --> 13:25.048
Sounds like Vaughn's awake.

13:25.049 --> 13:27.400
Damon, wait!

13:27.401 --> 13:30.352
Here.

13:30.354 --> 13:31.488
What the hell are you doing?

13:31.489 --> 13:33.440
Digging up Silas.

13:33.441 --> 13:35.024
Coming, Vaughn, or not?

13:50.201 --> 13:52.540
- Here we are!
- What is it?

13:53.038 --> 13:54.505
Is where I dumped Silas.

13:54.506 --> 13:56.874
Closed off to hikers,
no food for animals,

13:56.875 --> 13:59.577
endlessly deep water.

13:59.578 --> 14:00.911
I'm not following you, Damon.

14:00.912 --> 14:02.713
Where exactly did you put the body?

14:02.715 --> 14:05.600
Um, let me see.

14:05.601 --> 14:08.519
So I... I dragged his
stone ass through here,

14:08.520 --> 14:11.556
I flung him in
that general direction,

14:11.557 --> 14:13.307
and he tumbled down
into those weeds.

14:13.596 --> 14:15.026
I kind of lost him in the rocks.

14:15.447 --> 14:16.898
What do you know about physics?

14:17.064 --> 14:22.878
What is it? It's distance
equals velocity times time?

14:23.453 --> 14:24.702
Guess I should have
told you to bring

14:24.703 --> 14:27.271
some scuba gear, huh?

14:27.575 --> 14:30.440
Don't you two look cozy?

14:31.959 --> 14:35.946
So he seems nice.

14:35.947 --> 14:38.503
Don't make jokes.
I'll laugh, and you'll fall.

14:39.084 --> 14:40.668
I'm wearing the Gilbert ring.

14:40.669 --> 14:42.253
I can't be killed by
anything supernatural,

14:42.254 --> 14:44.639
so maybe if you're one
who detonates the bomb,

14:44.640 --> 14:45.885
I won't die.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.225
Absolutely not.

14:47.226 --> 14:50.557
You'll blow into a billion pieces,
the ring with it.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.766
There's only one way to find out.

14:54.767 --> 14:57.902
Fine. Ok.

14:57.903 --> 15:01.272
The first rule of truly living...

15:01.273 --> 15:03.194
Do the thing you're most afraid of.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.758
What are you doing?

15:21.759 --> 15:23.761
I can't be killed,
and you can't miss graduation.

15:23.762 --> 15:25.899
- Please go.
- No.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.600
Run!

15:30.685 --> 15:32.002
What have you done?

15:32.003 --> 15:34.305
I finally chose one
of the good ones.

15:37.373 --> 15:38.573
We have to do something.

15:38.574 --> 15:40.177
If those hunters give
the cure to Silas...

15:40.178 --> 15:41.479
They're not giving it to Silas.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.197
Wherever Damon has
taken Vaughn right now,

15:43.198 --> 15:45.149
it's a stall because
Damon hasn't had time

15:45.150 --> 15:48.369
to bury Silas' body yet.

15:48.370 --> 15:50.204
And that's all you
need to know right now.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.990
Ok. Fine.
We're stalling the hunters,

15:52.991 --> 15:54.659
but Damon is still dying.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.004
It was one bullet,
and it was only laced.

15:57.005 --> 15:58.305
We still have a little bit of time.

15:58.306 --> 16:01.127
I will go to New Orleans myself,
and I will beg Klaus if I have to.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.417
Then it's settled.

16:03.418 --> 16:07.204
- You're going to your graduation.
- Gradua... no, Jer.

16:07.205 --> 16:09.474
I never even sent in
my college applications.

16:09.475 --> 16:11.509
I don't care.
Mom and dad would kill you

16:11.510 --> 16:14.211
if there wasn't a photo of
you in your graduation get-up.

16:14.212 --> 16:16.768
Jer, no, not if you can't be there.

16:17.349 --> 16:20.234
Lexi will keep me company.

16:20.235 --> 16:21.651
You're going.

16:29.494 --> 16:32.746
Let's go graduate.

16:32.748 --> 16:35.333
Klaus, now is not the time
to decide that you are over me.

16:35.334 --> 16:36.868
I'm gonna call you every 10 minutes

16:36.869 --> 16:39.504
until you get your ass here
to save Damon's life.

16:39.505 --> 16:41.071
Where is everyone?

16:41.072 --> 16:42.373
I'm here.

16:42.374 --> 16:43.841
Where have you been?

16:43.842 --> 16:45.510
Oh, you know,
making plans for the summer,

16:45.511 --> 16:47.512
dodging death by vampire hunter.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.079
Where's Elena?

16:49.080 --> 16:50.765
We can't do this without her.

16:50.766 --> 16:52.265
I'm here!

16:58.055 --> 16:59.818
Thank you for today.

17:08.366 --> 17:10.070
I can't believe it.

17:10.435 --> 17:12.603
We're actually all here.

17:12.604 --> 17:15.940
We are all here together!

17:15.941 --> 17:18.459
Bonnie Bennett, are you crying?

17:18.460 --> 17:20.545
It's our last hurrah before
you guys go off to college.

17:20.546 --> 17:22.163
Before "we" go off to college.

17:22.164 --> 17:24.882
I kind of sort of
missed the deadline,

17:24.883 --> 17:26.884
you know, being
an emotionless bitch.

17:26.885 --> 17:28.669
The perks of being a vampire...

17:28.670 --> 17:30.755
We can wherever we want to go.

17:30.756 --> 17:32.223
We can choose our own roommates,

17:32.224 --> 17:34.058
we could... we could
get a triple room!

17:36.511 --> 17:38.391
I'm happy we're all here.

17:38.931 --> 17:41.933
Aww! Group hug!

17:41.934 --> 17:43.067
Uh, I don't... I don't hug.

17:43.068 --> 17:45.770
Oh! Get over yourself.
Ha ha ha!

17:45.771 --> 17:48.189
Welcome,
parents, family, and friends.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.407
What a beautiful day
for graduation.

17:52.833 --> 17:55.613
Thank you for joining us
today on this special day

17:55.614 --> 18:00.835
as we celebrate our graduates,
so let's get started.

18:00.836 --> 18:03.003
John Albrecht.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.341
David Bance.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.464
Sarah Beasley.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.598
Not to play favorites,

18:13.599 --> 18:16.717
but I am especially proud
of this next graduate,

18:17.220 --> 18:20.137
my lovely daughter Bonnie Bennett.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.175
Congratulations.

18:25.176 --> 18:28.483
I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.

18:28.981 --> 18:32.149
- Thanks, dad.
- You're welcome.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.738
For everything.

18:37.705 --> 18:40.708
Savannah Davis.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.121
Matt Donovan.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.030
William Duncan.

18:46.031 --> 18:47.998
Caroline Forbes.

18:50.668 --> 18:53.638
Matt Freeman.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.552
Elena Gilbert.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.897
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

19:04.381 --> 19:07.018
- Greetings, little witch.
- Jeff Gillies.

19:07.019 --> 19:08.565
Thought Stefan got rid of you.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.554
He did, and I spent
the night crawling

19:10.555 --> 19:13.774
out of a cement grave.

19:13.775 --> 19:17.949
Isn't that the witch
your friend Caroline killed?

19:19.074 --> 19:21.565
And over there,
that's my hybrid friend Adrian,

19:21.566 --> 19:23.121
also dead.

19:23.535 --> 19:27.888
In fact, these seats are scattered
with two dozen supernatural faces,

19:28.208 --> 19:32.009
all of who have reason to lash out
since their lives were sacrificed

19:32.010 --> 19:34.382
in order to make
your expression triangle.

19:34.796 --> 19:36.714
All they're waiting
on is word from me.

19:36.715 --> 19:38.349
The veil goes back up tonight.

19:38.350 --> 19:39.467
Don't you have anything
better to do

19:39.468 --> 19:42.803
- than harass me and my friends?
- Well, that's the thing.

19:42.804 --> 19:45.439
I don't want
the veil to go back up.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.641
In fact,
I want you to drop it completely

19:47.642 --> 19:51.428
so I and my fallen
friends can live, Bonnie.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.780
It's time to pay the piper.

20:01.749 --> 20:04.468
The Kol I remember was adamantly
against hell on earth.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.887
I was...
But I was in hell.

20:06.888 --> 20:10.223
Now I would very much
like to be back on earth.

20:13.844 --> 20:15.846
- What's this?
- It's me.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.398
I died last night.

20:17.399 --> 20:18.599
I'm a ghost,

20:18.600 --> 20:21.318
and I want the same thing you want.

20:21.319 --> 20:24.787
I don't want to be on the other
side with unfinished business.

20:24.789 --> 20:26.323
I want my parents
to see my off to college,

20:26.324 --> 20:28.576
I want to decorate my dorm
room with my best friends.

20:28.577 --> 20:32.947
I want to stay here, Kol,
more than anything.

20:32.948 --> 20:35.833
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's do it together.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.068
What have you done?

20:42.073 --> 20:43.740
This will hold you till the dark,

20:43.741 --> 20:45.176
and when the veil is back up,

20:45.177 --> 20:46.577
this town will be rid
of you for good.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.179
But everything you just said...

20:48.180 --> 20:49.580
Was true,

20:49.581 --> 20:52.683
but we don't always
get what we want, do we?

20:52.684 --> 20:57.587
What's wrong, laddie, can't swim?

21:00.307 --> 21:02.476
What the hell happened to you?

21:02.477 --> 21:05.896
Oh. Oh. Will you look at that?

21:05.897 --> 21:07.481
That is nasty.

21:07.482 --> 21:10.267
Connor. Heh.
He must have laced these bullets

21:10.268 --> 21:11.402
with werewolf venom.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.988
Ding, ding, ding!

21:13.989 --> 21:15.406
You're not as dumb as you sound.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.737
This was all a lie, eh?

21:19.903 --> 21:22.413
You knew you were a dead man.

21:22.414 --> 21:26.050
Well, you're not getting this back.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.621
Where'd you put Silas?

21:29.087 --> 21:32.172
Ugh!

21:32.173 --> 21:34.008
One more jolt of werewolf toxin,

21:34.334 --> 21:35.850
and you'll be dead within minutes.

21:38.198 --> 21:39.632
Where's Silas?!

21:49.306 --> 21:52.660
Oops.

21:52.661 --> 21:55.312
One slight problem.

21:55.313 --> 22:01.312
- You mean this?
- Yes. Yes, that.

22:08.510 --> 22:10.377
I would love nothing
more than to get out of here

22:10.378 --> 22:12.096
before Vaughn comes back to life,

22:12.097 --> 22:15.883
but Damon won't take the cure.
He wants it for Elena.

22:15.884 --> 22:17.268
All right.
Just hang on a little longer.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.852
Caroline's calling Klaus again.

22:18.853 --> 22:21.855
Stefan, we are past the point
of hail Mary phone calls.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.391
What do you want me to do,
stand here and watch him die

22:24.392 --> 22:27.013
or force-feed him the cure?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.195
Stefan!

22:31.700 --> 22:33.102
Remember us, Caroline?

22:33.268 --> 22:34.684
Unh!

22:41.068 --> 22:43.946
There are plenty more
of these to go around.

22:44.112 --> 22:47.658
Who's next?
I can do this all day.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.177
Hi.

23:00.178 --> 23:02.513
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

23:02.514 --> 23:05.482
- So it's all healed up?
- Fresh as a Daisy.

23:05.483 --> 23:07.576
Good.
Unh!

23:07.577 --> 23:09.436
Ouch.

23:09.437 --> 23:12.222
Yeah. I taught her that swing.

23:12.223 --> 23:14.108
You know it's not
polite to eavesdrop, right?

23:14.109 --> 23:15.609
Hey. I'm short on time here.

23:15.610 --> 23:19.229
Don't rob me of what
little joy I have.

23:19.773 --> 23:20.864
Anyone seen Jeremy?

23:20.865 --> 23:22.482
Ohh. He went to see Bonnie.

23:22.484 --> 23:26.236
He'll be back later,
you know, before...

23:26.237 --> 23:29.957
- Well, you know.
- Yeah.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.954
Stefan, can I, um...
Can I have a moment?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.577
Sure.

23:42.970 --> 23:47.223
- This could get interesting.
- Usually does.

23:47.224 --> 23:50.930
So the other side.
Not exactly a party, is it?

23:51.096 --> 23:54.565
I've lived... better.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.700
You know there's something
else out there, right?

23:56.701 --> 23:57.985
There has to be.

23:57.986 --> 24:00.437
Silas' whole agenda
was to find peace

24:00.438 --> 24:02.775
with his one true love,

24:02.941 --> 24:07.029
and whatever peace is,
it's out there.

24:07.195 --> 24:12.633
I figure once we've served our time
for all the bad things we've done,

24:12.634 --> 24:18.633
then it's just about
letting go and moving on.

24:20.175 --> 24:23.210
And how are we supposed to do that
when the knuckleheads we care about

24:23.211 --> 24:26.730
can't seem to keep
their lives straight?

24:26.731 --> 24:28.732
Yeah.

24:28.733 --> 24:31.813
So, uh, what's up?

24:33.521 --> 24:36.767
Honestly, Stefan,
I just wanted to thank you

24:36.933 --> 24:39.810
for sticking by me
when I was at my worst,

24:39.811 --> 24:42.315
for believing that
I was still in there.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.364
Even after everything
I put you through,

24:44.365 --> 24:48.619
you... you never gave up on me.

24:48.620 --> 24:52.178
I, uh, I kind of owed you one.

24:56.767 --> 24:57.830
Here.

25:00.147 --> 25:02.849
It's yours.
I want you to have it.

25:07.471 --> 25:09.208
No, Elena. I'm not...

25:09.209 --> 25:15.208
Stefan, the only person worse at
being a vampire than me is you.

25:15.563 --> 25:17.915
Human blood is your downfall.

25:18.182 --> 25:21.735
You got the raw end
of the vampire deal.

25:21.736 --> 25:25.456
The rest of us will be fine.
We'll survive.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.986
I mean, you taught us.

25:29.152 --> 25:33.546
You deserve whatever
you want out of life.

25:35.332 --> 25:37.119
You deserve this.

25:51.815 --> 25:55.554
- How'd you get here so fast?
- I was already on my way.

25:56.053 --> 25:59.188
I received your
graduation announcement.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.025
It's very subtle.

26:02.026 --> 26:05.946
- I assume you're expecting cash.
- That or a mini fridge.

26:05.947 --> 26:07.898
I had considered offering
you a first-class ticket

26:07.899 --> 26:11.168
to join me in New Orleans,

26:11.169 --> 26:13.954
but I knew what
your answer would be,

26:13.955 --> 26:19.412
so I opted for something
I knew you would accept.

26:20.011 --> 26:23.532
Tyler is now free
to return to Mystic Falls.

26:26.433 --> 26:28.352
What?

26:28.353 --> 26:33.357
He's your first love.

26:33.358 --> 26:36.859
I intend to be your last,

26:36.861 --> 26:39.729
however long it takes.

26:46.870 --> 26:52.325
Congratulations, Caroline.

26:52.327 --> 26:56.747
Let's get out of here
before 12 angry hybrids

26:56.748 --> 26:58.534
decide to pick a fight.

27:06.166 --> 27:10.504
- I wanted to apologize.
- Good.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.964
Let me finish.
I said I wanted to,

27:13.965 --> 27:16.399
and then a realized I'm not sorry.

27:18.635 --> 27:21.939
You would rather die than be human,

27:21.940 --> 27:24.241
and you expect me
to be ok with that?

27:24.242 --> 27:25.359
I didn't say you were
supposed be ok with it.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.311
I just said I'm not sorry,

27:28.312 --> 27:33.116
but you know what
I really am? Selfish.

27:33.117 --> 27:36.153
Because I make bad choices
that hurt you.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.372
Yes, I would rather
have died than be human.

27:38.373 --> 27:41.341
I'd rather die right now than spend
a handful of years with you

27:41.342 --> 27:43.493
only to lose you when I'm too
old and sick and miserable

27:43.494 --> 27:44.962
and you're still you.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.763
I'd rather die right now

27:46.764 --> 27:49.132
than spend my last,
final years remembering

27:49.133 --> 27:50.968
how I good I had it
and how happy I was

27:50.969 --> 27:54.304
because that's who I am, Elena,
and I'm not gonna change,

27:54.305 --> 27:56.523
and there's no apology in the world

27:56.524 --> 27:59.512
that encompasses all the reasons
that I'm wrong for you.

28:08.068 --> 28:12.623
Fine. Then I'm not sorry either.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.610
I'm not sorry that I met you.

28:14.776 --> 28:19.195
I'm not sorry that knowing you
has made me question everything

28:19.196 --> 28:24.534
and that in death you're the one
that made me feel most alive.

28:24.535 --> 28:28.082
You've been a terrible person.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.756
You made all the wrong choices,

28:29.757 --> 28:31.541
and of all the choices
that I have made,

28:31.542 --> 28:33.176
this will prove
to be the worst one,

28:33.177 --> 28:36.228
but I am not sorry
that I'm love with you.

28:38.982 --> 28:42.686
I love you, Damon.

28:42.687 --> 28:44.320
I love you.

29:17.587 --> 29:20.606
Now who's eavesdropping?

29:43.647 --> 29:44.658
Stefan.

29:50.704 --> 29:53.374
Think the quarry will be
deep enough to bury Silas?

29:53.375 --> 29:56.410
Yeah. I don't think anyone's
gonna stumble on him there.

29:56.411 --> 29:57.995
Yeah.
You want me to, uh...

29:57.996 --> 30:01.425
No. It's all right.
I got Lexi coming with me.

30:02.866 --> 30:06.553
Right. Yeah.

30:09.139 --> 30:11.492
Hey, Damon.

30:11.493 --> 30:12.809
Yeah.

30:15.712 --> 30:18.231
I'm not happy about Elena...

30:20.267 --> 30:24.904
But I'm not not happy
for you either.

30:27.324 --> 30:30.727
I just want you to know that.

30:30.728 --> 30:32.830
Thanks, brother.

30:40.422 --> 30:44.384
Hey. I needed to see you.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.344
I need to close the veil, Jer.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.330
The hybrids and the hunters...

30:49.331 --> 30:52.016
I get it.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.435
I'm ready.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.754
I just wanted to be with
you when it happened.

30:57.755 --> 31:02.092
- Did you and Elena...
- I can't... I can't say good bye to her.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.930
We said no tears,
and I left her a letter.

31:05.931 --> 31:09.416
She'll find it
when all this is over.

31:09.417 --> 31:10.917
I'm ready.

31:28.085 --> 31:31.889
- Moon's full.
- Yeah.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.674
Where's Elena?

31:33.675 --> 31:36.626
She went to find Bonnie and Jeremy.
She's worried about the time.

31:39.597 --> 31:40.858
What?

31:41.024 --> 31:43.934
You got the girl, man.

31:43.935 --> 31:47.554
I got the girl.

31:47.555 --> 31:51.609
Now don't screw it up.

31:51.610 --> 31:55.329
Well, with you looking
over my shoulder,

31:55.330 --> 31:56.779
how can I?

32:02.703 --> 32:05.006
New York?
Too close.

32:05.172 --> 32:06.256
Ohh! Vegas!

32:06.257 --> 32:08.208
Oh. No.
Too touristy.

32:08.209 --> 32:09.793
Look. I know you think I'm joking,

32:09.794 --> 32:12.329
but you are leaving.

32:12.330 --> 32:15.265
You just graduated
for the millionth time.

32:15.266 --> 32:19.436
It's time to start
living your life.

32:19.437 --> 32:24.674
What if Elena was the one?

32:24.676 --> 32:26.944
She was,

32:26.945 --> 32:30.490
and she will always be
an epic love.

32:30.915 --> 32:36.153
Contrary to popular belief,
there are actually multiple ones,

32:36.154 --> 32:40.324
especially for a vampire.

32:40.325 --> 32:45.045
The only way to find
another is to let go

32:45.505 --> 32:46.963
and move on.

32:49.366 --> 32:51.668
Never been to Portland.

33:01.545 --> 33:03.179
See you, Lexi.

33:07.101 --> 33:10.154
Bonnie, Jer, are you guys here?

33:10.446 --> 33:12.389
Well, well.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.326
Speaking of unfinished business.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.894
Ohh! Raah!

33:27.838 --> 33:30.373
Happy graduation, cupcake.

33:42.065 --> 33:43.689
It's almost closed.

33:43.968 --> 33:46.352
So this is it?

33:46.353 --> 33:48.321
Because there were a million
things I wanted to say to you,

33:48.322 --> 33:50.556
but now nothing seems quite right.

33:50.557 --> 33:52.691
Then don't say anything.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.045
What's happening?

34:12.045 --> 34:14.135
Oh, my God.

34:14.665 --> 34:15.762
What is it?

34:16.033 --> 34:18.818
It worked, Jer.

34:18.819 --> 34:20.253
I did a spell that
brought you back.

34:20.254 --> 34:21.487
I didn't think it would work,

34:21.489 --> 34:23.656
but I... I closed the veil,

34:23.657 --> 34:27.043
and you're still here.

34:27.043 --> 34:29.234
Wait. I'm alive?

34:32.532 --> 34:34.114
Bonnie.

34:42.876 --> 34:45.293
I can't feel your hand.

34:47.413 --> 34:48.614
What's going on, Bonnie?

34:48.614 --> 34:49.920
Why can't I feel you?

34:50.384 --> 34:51.951
It's ok.

34:51.952 --> 34:53.757
Bonnie, what did you do?

34:54.088 --> 34:57.257
I have the witches

34:57.258 --> 34:59.292
and my grams.

34:59.293 --> 35:00.459
You can see ghosts.

35:00.460 --> 35:03.062
We can talk whenever we want.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.799
No. No! No!
You can't be dead!

35:06.800 --> 35:09.135
Do me this one favor.

35:09.136 --> 35:10.820
Tell Elena and Caroline that

35:10.821 --> 35:12.972
I'm spending
the summer with my mom.

35:12.973 --> 35:14.908
I can't.

35:14.909 --> 35:16.442
They need to know.

35:16.443 --> 35:20.914
You know, the first time in
forever, my friends are ok.

35:20.915 --> 35:24.039
I don't want to
take that from them.

35:33.593 --> 35:36.345
I'm gonna be ok.

35:36.347 --> 35:38.013
I promise.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.648
Hey.

35:55.649 --> 35:56.849
What are you doing here?

35:56.850 --> 35:58.518
I just wanted to see
if you were ok.

35:58.519 --> 35:59.992
Rough day and whatnot.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.038
Thanks. Look.
I'd invite you in,

36:02.039 --> 36:04.190
but I promised Tyler
I was gonna keep this

36:04.191 --> 36:06.158
a low-vampire zone.

36:09.629 --> 36:11.931
I know that we were
under duress today,

36:11.932 --> 36:17.931
so whatever, you know,
plans that we were making,

36:18.839 --> 36:22.358
in understand if you don't want to.

36:22.359 --> 36:26.646
You and I, this isn't gonna work.

36:26.647 --> 36:31.517
I need to keep my love life
a low-vampire zone, too, ok?

36:31.518 --> 36:34.988
Of course.
I get it.

36:34.989 --> 36:40.192
So whatever happens on the road
stays on the road, all right?

36:42.362 --> 36:44.613
That little wedding town in Italy,

36:44.615 --> 36:46.699
don't get any ideas about
turning me into a vampire

36:46.700 --> 36:48.301
so we can live
eternally ever after,

36:48.302 --> 36:49.325
you know what I mean?

36:49.326 --> 36:51.587
I'm sorry.
Are you saying that...

36:51.918 --> 36:54.507
I've never set one foot
outside of this town,

36:54.508 --> 36:56.259
I have no college plans,

36:56.260 --> 36:58.661
no idea what
the future holds for me,

36:59.008 --> 37:01.196
but I do know that it's time
that I start truly living,

37:01.198 --> 37:04.517
and since you almost
killed me this year,

37:04.518 --> 37:08.754
I figure it's
your obligation to show me how.

37:08.755 --> 37:09.889
Ok.

37:09.890 --> 37:12.108
Unh!

37:12.109 --> 37:13.592
What are you doing?

37:13.593 --> 37:16.526
Would you believe
I'm having a bad day?

37:20.116 --> 37:23.485
It started when Bonnie denied
me my Silas-like immortality.

37:23.487 --> 37:25.571
Of course because Katherine
Pierce can't be happy

37:25.572 --> 37:27.829
with good old
vampire-caliber immortality.

37:35.214 --> 37:36.582
I deserved it.

37:36.583 --> 37:38.215
I never had a graduation or a prom

37:38.785 --> 37:42.971
or, you know, a life,
but you did.

37:42.973 --> 37:44.640
You have everything,

37:44.641 --> 37:46.625
and it's not because
you're a good little girl

37:46.626 --> 37:50.645
who deserves happiness.
It's because you stole mine.

37:52.899 --> 37:57.436
I stole your happiness?
You killed my brother.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.992
I'll admit that was nasty.

38:03.405 --> 38:04.616
Yaaaah!

38:14.504 --> 38:19.092
I have nothing...

38:19.422 --> 38:21.258
But I'm about to change that.

38:24.548 --> 38:26.883
Oh, kicking someone
while they're down.

38:26.884 --> 38:29.969
Classy till the end, Katherine.

38:29.970 --> 38:32.437
Your end.

38:44.066 --> 38:47.152
You deserve whatever
you want out of life.

38:49.038 --> 38:50.662
You deserve this.

38:53.692 --> 38:58.962
Listen. I'm glad you're ok
with who you are now,

38:59.128 --> 39:03.169
but every single thing
I did to get this

39:03.170 --> 39:05.888
I did for you so that the choice

39:05.889 --> 39:09.475
of whether you wanted
to be a vampire or not

39:09.476 --> 39:12.961
would always be yours.

39:21.354 --> 39:23.156
Bye-bye, little girl.

39:23.157 --> 39:25.525
Unh!

39:40.169 --> 39:43.341
Have a nice human life, Katherine.

40:05.982 --> 40:08.782
Don't bother.
I'm not there anymore.

40:14.207 --> 40:16.943
Silas.

40:16.944 --> 40:18.895
You were stone.
They saw you.

40:18.896 --> 40:20.162
The spell worked.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.381
That's the funny
thing about spells.

40:22.382 --> 40:24.250
They're bound by nature,

40:24.251 --> 40:26.285
and nature demands balance,

40:26.286 --> 40:28.844
so every spell has a loophole.

40:29.256 --> 40:31.340
The spell that turned me to stone

40:31.341 --> 40:34.560
was bound by a witch,
a living witch,

40:34.561 --> 40:37.396
so when that witch died,

40:37.397 --> 40:38.728
the spell broke.

40:38.894 --> 40:41.100
Bonnie.

40:41.101 --> 40:42.190
Bonnie's not dead.

40:42.356 --> 40:43.900
It doesn't matter, does it?

40:44.438 --> 40:49.108
And here's where the mystery
of me comes full circle.

40:49.109 --> 40:52.778
I created the immortality
spell 2,000 years ago.

40:52.779 --> 40:57.415
I could never die,
so nature needed to find a balance,

40:57.417 --> 41:01.003
a version of me that could die,

41:01.004 --> 41:03.789
a shadow self,

41:03.790 --> 41:06.659
a doppelganger.

41:06.660 --> 41:09.160
So this is finally your real face?

41:11.163 --> 41:13.266
You're another one of them?

41:13.267 --> 41:15.433
Not exactly.

41:22.975 --> 41:25.293
Hello, my shadow self.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.234
