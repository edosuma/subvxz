01:35.007 --> 01:39.603
You, Al, are an object lesson
in the healing powers of obstinacy... 

01:39.687 --> 01:41.518
and a hostile disposition.

01:42.047 --> 01:43.924
My leg and arm are waxy.

01:44.007 --> 01:46.805
How they feel to you
is not the relevant measure.

01:47.007 --> 01:50.158
I judge objectively
the way they respond to stimuli...

01:50.247 --> 01:53.364
and they are much fucking improved.

01:53.607 --> 01:57.486
In the overall, sir, I call you a miracle.

02:05.127 --> 02:06.879
Ready to meet the world.

02:13.247 --> 02:16.762
How much longer you suppose
I'll be buying claims, Mr Wolcott?

02:17.527 --> 02:18.960
We're close to the end.

02:20.287 --> 02:22.847
Otherwise, I'll need to start
dancing out here in long johns...

02:22.927 --> 02:24.645
or baying at the moon.

02:24.847 --> 02:27.680
Give people some idea of why
I'm going against logic.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.598
This phase is nearly over...

02:30.647 --> 02:32.160
even as another begins.

02:37.807 --> 02:39.957
I propose formation of a bank...

02:40.527 --> 02:43.439
Mr Star, with yourself as chief officer...

02:43.767 --> 02:46.565
my holdings in the camp
standing surety...

02:47.167 --> 02:49.317
and Mr Ellsworth as overseer
of my interests.

02:49.407 --> 02:50.601
I see.

02:51.407 --> 02:53.398
Not quite a rousing endorsement.

02:53.607 --> 02:58.158
It's just what's needed, Mrs Garret.
I don't know that I should be part of it.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.845
- Why, Mr Star?
- Other obligations.

03:02.967 --> 03:04.525
Oughtn't you...

03:04.687 --> 03:08.521
or anyone urging such connections
as disqualifying you...

03:08.607 --> 03:10.518
think of the good of the camp?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.165
We all have...

03:14.047 --> 03:16.481
complicating obligations.

03:46.287 --> 03:48.721
Might those be my new employees?

03:51.447 --> 03:54.484
There's a combat in prospect
between those two.

03:54.687 --> 03:57.281
As equal as the Sioux with the Whites.

04:28.567 --> 04:29.716
All right?

04:30.127 --> 04:33.676
Well, you left upright,
about half a cunt hair.

04:34.047 --> 04:35.366
Well, bring me fucking straight then.

04:35.447 --> 04:36.766
I got him, Dan.

04:39.687 --> 04:40.722
Whoa.

04:40.807 --> 04:42.718
Right, there you go. Straight as a string.

04:42.807 --> 04:44.126
Stand back then, Johnny.

04:44.207 --> 04:46.960
Any drool, first fucking fleck,
you give me this.

04:47.047 --> 04:49.197
You never showed no fucking spittle, Al.

04:49.487 --> 04:51.284
Do as I fucking say.

04:51.527 --> 04:52.801
Yes, sir.

04:55.327 --> 04:56.396
I'm going in.

04:56.847 --> 04:58.917
Then why am I in first chair?

05:00.647 --> 05:02.763
Anyone else suck his prick?

05:18.327 --> 05:20.602
You washed your hands of me,
Mr Tolliver...

05:20.687 --> 05:22.837
when I was beset amid that rabble...

05:22.927 --> 05:26.124
no less contemptibly
than Pontius Pilate.

05:26.447 --> 05:30.918
Sometimes the shadow's cast
by the sheltering hand.

05:33.687 --> 05:35.996
Meaning the rabble
was under your control?

05:36.087 --> 05:38.123
No, sir. Wouldn't have them.

05:38.207 --> 05:41.961
I am attuned, though, to the workings
of what passes for their minds.

05:42.047 --> 05:44.083
This morning we see the result:

05:44.167 --> 05:47.876
more claims offered for sale
and prices pressed downward.

05:48.447 --> 05:52.679
You suppose the owners fear
you might visit your ire on their titles?

05:52.967 --> 05:55.959
- I want to get out of here.
- I understand.

05:59.527 --> 06:04.043
Will you have a quick wind
of your timepiece before you go?

06:04.127 --> 06:06.038
No. No, sir, I will not.

06:06.127 --> 06:08.197
I feel the earth washing away
from beneath me.

06:08.287 --> 06:09.766
I want to go away.

06:10.047 --> 06:11.924
We'll fucking miss you.

06:16.567 --> 06:20.401
And you, Mr Wolcott, I find you
the most severe disappointment of all.

06:20.607 --> 06:22.438
Often to myself as well.

06:26.967 --> 06:30.039
What impressions do we expect
he'll take to Yankton?

06:30.967 --> 06:33.197
That your money spends...

06:33.327 --> 06:35.921
and I'm a dangerous man
with whom to disagree.

06:36.567 --> 06:39.843
You put us together, don't that make us
the very image of Mr Hearst...

06:39.927 --> 06:42.521
as he'd want Yankton to think of him?

06:45.767 --> 06:47.564
How's the Jew-fucking going?

06:49.327 --> 06:50.521
It's all right.

06:50.647 --> 06:52.877
What does it add to my understanding?

06:52.967 --> 06:55.435
He's meeting with the widow
this morning.

06:56.687 --> 07:00.600
Spoke to the other of forming a bank,
and of her in that connection.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.326
- Who's the fucking "other"?
- Fucking Bullock.

07:03.407 --> 07:06.046
My sensibilities
do not need coddling, either.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.323
It's no concern for you.

07:09.007 --> 07:11.202
I don't like naming the cocksucker.

07:13.247 --> 07:15.522
Anyways, that may be its purpose...

07:17.047 --> 07:19.003
his sitting down with the widow.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.046
The Jew?

07:22.967 --> 07:25.322
I hope you're getting paid for the pussy.

07:25.407 --> 07:28.479
Don't put a price to it,
you'll lose their respect.

07:28.927 --> 07:30.406
He's teaching me accounts.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.125
That's all right then.

07:32.287 --> 07:34.755
Learning is like currency to them.

07:36.327 --> 07:40.605
He stares in my eyes
when he fucks me, longing-like.

07:41.047 --> 07:42.446
Jesus Christ.

07:46.247 --> 07:48.078
You don't look so bad.

07:48.447 --> 07:50.836
Yeah, next thing to up and about.

08:00.607 --> 08:02.086
Ma'am, may I?

08:03.087 --> 08:06.159
A.W. Merrick, ma'am,
of the Black Hills Pioneer...

08:06.247 --> 08:08.317
making bold to introduce himself.

08:09.487 --> 08:11.000
I am Mary Stokes, Mr Merrick.

08:11.087 --> 08:15.524
I thought so! I hoped so. I'm delighted
to make your acquaintance, ma'am.

08:15.607 --> 08:18.997
And for the camp's children,
whom you will edify.

08:20.727 --> 08:22.206
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

08:22.287 --> 08:24.847
And your bags, your bags.
Let's see, are they up here?

08:32.967 --> 08:34.160
Liar.

08:52.567 --> 08:55.525
- Miss Trixie.
- What is this now?

08:55.607 --> 08:57.996
Nothing nefarious. I was looking for you.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.879
My nerves have had a shock.

09:00.087 --> 09:03.238
- How so?
- Mrs Garret took poorly.

09:03.487 --> 09:05.318
At the meeting with Mr Star?

09:08.687 --> 09:09.802
Come here.

09:18.687 --> 09:20.279
I'll add that...

09:21.167 --> 09:24.000
she hasn't looked well
the last few weeks...

09:24.087 --> 09:26.203
especially in the morning. Pale.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.359
What are you fucking hinting at?

09:28.447 --> 09:29.766
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

09:29.847 --> 09:33.760
She ain't looked well mornings
opposed to the rest of the day? Pale?

09:36.807 --> 09:40.402
How does sharing observations
make me liable to rebuke?

09:40.607 --> 09:42.325
You got her knocked up, in other words.

09:42.527 --> 09:45.758
Me? I ain't got her
in any way at all, Trixie.

09:45.927 --> 09:49.556
In your opinion, I'm saying,
she's in the way.

09:50.087 --> 09:52.555
I work for the woman
in her fucking employ.

09:52.807 --> 09:54.081
I understand that.

09:54.167 --> 09:57.284
And that is the sole
fucking full extent of it.

09:59.287 --> 10:01.243
Would you do the right thing?

10:02.487 --> 10:04.364
I was not involved.

10:04.447 --> 10:07.644
We're fucking past that.
I know you weren't fucking involved.

10:07.847 --> 10:09.678
Who was involved, too...

10:10.967 --> 10:12.923
far as that fucking goes?

10:13.407 --> 10:14.601
Would you?

10:15.407 --> 10:16.965
Would I fucking what?

10:17.367 --> 10:20.723
Do the right fucking thing
in that fucking situation?

10:21.287 --> 10:23.721
What's the situation? Explain it.

10:24.247 --> 10:26.203
If she wanted the child...

10:26.287 --> 10:30.121
how a woman wants one that ain't
certain she's made to bear many...

10:30.447 --> 10:32.677
willing even to bear it out of wedlock...

10:32.767 --> 10:36.362
but for the hurt she'd do another
and the humiliation she'd do...

10:36.967 --> 10:41.040
and to that other woman's little boy.
Would you do it then?

10:43.527 --> 10:44.516
Do?

10:44.687 --> 10:47.406
The right fucking thing.
Don't get fucking coy with me.

10:48.687 --> 10:50.803
Marry her, you're saying?

10:51.967 --> 10:54.640
And the child in the eyes of others...

10:55.287 --> 10:57.164
the issue of my loins.

10:57.727 --> 10:59.877
As much as they care to see.

11:00.687 --> 11:02.917
This is only a passing glance.

11:04.607 --> 11:08.395
So the cum's true author
ain't thrown in their fucking face.

11:09.647 --> 11:14.562
Or the true author's wife's face,
or the face of that little fucking boy.

11:15.607 --> 11:16.722
Well?

11:22.207 --> 11:24.198
Would she fucking have me?

11:24.447 --> 11:26.483
I'd work on that next.

11:27.647 --> 11:29.797
- Books.
- Ah, wonderful.

11:30.287 --> 11:32.243
I parted with several boxes in Bismarck.

11:32.327 --> 11:35.399
I'm sure to Bismarck's betterment.

11:35.807 --> 11:37.638
Mostly for the sake of the children.

11:37.727 --> 11:40.400
The other few, might I suspect...

11:40.487 --> 11:43.285
for the sake of certain
childhood memories of your own?

11:43.447 --> 11:46.166
You may, and be in the right.

11:46.367 --> 11:49.564
When you're situated, Miss Stokes...

11:50.087 --> 11:53.796
may I take you on a tour of the camp?

11:54.367 --> 11:55.925
I would be grateful.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.165
No more than I, Miss Stokes,
I assure you.

11:59.567 --> 12:01.797
Oh, a man's come to camp. Wolcott.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.597
Agent for the Hearst's interest.

12:06.247 --> 12:09.683
I believe he's made calls
with Tolliver and Yankton.

12:09.767 --> 12:12.156
That's why Yankton's
suddenly got balls.

12:12.407 --> 12:14.204
I made him think
I was trying to gull him...

12:14.287 --> 12:16.755
and that he had
turned the tables on me.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.163
How much did he buy you for?

12:20.207 --> 12:23.085
I kept Dan apprised
while you convalesced...

12:23.607 --> 12:25.438
in abbreviated fashion.

12:26.007 --> 12:27.122
How much?

12:28.207 --> 12:29.799
Oh, $10,000.

12:30.807 --> 12:35.642
Enlisting me, so he thought, to spread
rumours about rescission of the claims.

12:36.807 --> 12:38.877
Tolliver's the front?

12:40.807 --> 12:44.004
Buying from the panicked sellers,
engaged by this Wolcott.

12:44.167 --> 12:46.283
This agent for George Hearst?

12:48.127 --> 12:50.038
That's it in a nutshell.

12:57.487 --> 12:59.682
I meant you no disloyalty, Al.

13:01.207 --> 13:04.722
You look out for yourself
against the chance I'd die.

13:05.167 --> 13:07.476
I never wished for that outcome.

13:08.327 --> 13:10.636
But I am a born follower.

13:10.807 --> 13:13.685
In any case, here we are...

13:14.047 --> 13:18.643
if tactically disadvantaged,
exactly as before in strength.

13:27.647 --> 13:30.207
Oh, sure. Thank you, sir.

13:38.847 --> 13:40.917
- Morning.
- Morning, Sol.

13:44.727 --> 13:45.921
Thanks for opening.

13:48.247 --> 13:49.441
You were out.

13:51.847 --> 13:55.999
Yes. Yes, I paid a call
and then I've been walking.

13:58.127 --> 13:59.845
The call was on Mrs Garret.

13:59.927 --> 14:02.316
We agreed that wasn't gonna happen.

14:02.567 --> 14:06.196
Our agreement was to not solicit
her investment in a bank.

14:06.687 --> 14:09.326
The call I paid was at her invitation.

14:11.887 --> 14:15.197
I don't give a fuck who invited who, Sol.

14:15.287 --> 14:16.356
That's your position.

14:16.447 --> 14:19.519
Was the bank the subject
of the meeting? Get out!

14:20.287 --> 14:22.676
Excuse us a little while, please.

14:24.207 --> 14:26.118
She invited me, Seth.

14:26.207 --> 14:29.597
To talk of forming a bank,
came here and invited you?

14:29.687 --> 14:31.325
Sent Ellsworth that works for her.

14:31.407 --> 14:33.284
You told me none of it.

14:33.367 --> 14:35.961
Suspecting maybe
you mightn't act rational.

14:36.047 --> 14:37.878
But I bet you told the whore.

14:39.207 --> 14:41.277
We're done talking about this for now.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.642
- No!
- Yes, Seth.

14:43.727 --> 14:45.285
We're done talking about this.

14:45.367 --> 14:46.925
If you keep it up, we're going to fight...

14:47.007 --> 14:49.316
and you'll have to work by yourself
while I convalesce.

14:56.367 --> 14:59.279
Until late, Mr Swearengen,
I was employed by Alma Garret...

14:59.367 --> 15:01.119
as tutor to her orphan ward.

15:01.207 --> 15:04.279
- Sacked two days ago.
- Let her tell it.

15:05.087 --> 15:06.315
In the course of my employment...

15:06.407 --> 15:09.399
I frequently saw Mrs Garret
under the influence of opiates.

15:09.487 --> 15:10.920
In this state, she admitted to me...

15:11.007 --> 15:13.077
having commissioned
the murder of her husband.

15:13.167 --> 15:14.600
What a world.

15:15.487 --> 15:17.478
She named you as her instrument.

15:17.567 --> 15:18.682
Said I killed him?

15:18.767 --> 15:21.281
She never specified
you'd actually killed him.

15:21.367 --> 15:23.403
- Left it vague-like.
- Exactly.

15:23.487 --> 15:26.399
- That I was her instrument?
- Yes.

15:26.487 --> 15:30.366
So we could pin it on someone else,
or I could take the fall, confess...

15:30.447 --> 15:32.722
- supporting your version?
- Yes.

15:32.807 --> 15:35.719
In writing
and then subsequently escape.

15:36.207 --> 15:37.925
Such has been known to occur.

15:38.167 --> 15:40.806
Leaving the widow lonely
at the bar of justice.

15:40.967 --> 15:42.798
Better one than none at all.

15:45.327 --> 15:48.285
- Who do you work for?
- People of means.

15:48.687 --> 15:51.406
People you work for were hired
by people of means.

15:51.487 --> 15:54.797
Don't get cagey, Miss Isringhausen.

15:56.007 --> 15:58.362
Let me suggest, Mr Swearengen...

15:58.447 --> 16:00.881
you do not get distracted
from your opportunity.

16:00.967 --> 16:03.959
Not who I work for should concern you,
but the amount you'll be paid...

16:04.047 --> 16:05.639
and the surety of its delivery.

16:05.727 --> 16:06.796
Too fucking true.

16:06.887 --> 16:10.562
Why, I pray fervently it ain't
the Pinkertons whose pay you're in...

16:10.847 --> 16:14.078
and that her dead husband's people
hired to steal her gold.

16:14.287 --> 16:17.359
I got unrelated reasons
to hate those cocksuckers.

16:17.687 --> 16:18.915
$50,000.

16:19.007 --> 16:21.396
I'm hard-pressed to think
who the fuck else it would be.

16:21.487 --> 16:23.796
$50,000, Mr Swearengen.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.357
Separate from pay to your subordinates.

16:26.447 --> 16:28.642
- Your pockets, not mine?
- Yes.

16:29.127 --> 16:31.766
Would it go against his for the pussy?

16:32.287 --> 16:33.800
No charge for the pussy.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.159
- Mind if I take the day?
- Not at all.

16:40.687 --> 16:42.757
I've got a lot on my plate just now...

16:42.847 --> 16:45.964
and I'm feeling less
than my full fucking self.

16:46.967 --> 16:49.197
You seem quite formidable to me.

16:50.167 --> 16:52.237
In any case, I'll wait to hear from Silas.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.002
Do.

16:56.167 --> 16:57.520
That'd be grand.

17:07.646 --> 17:10.480
I guess if I called you a cunt,
I needn't expect you to faint?

17:10.567 --> 17:12.717
- No.
- Getting struck be a first?

17:12.807 --> 17:14.525
How have I injured your interests?

17:14.607 --> 17:17.246
Think he's upstairs considering me
for promotion?

17:18.207 --> 17:20.721
Anyway, clear out of my room.

17:21.327 --> 17:23.282
Come up and fuck me, why don't you?

17:24.007 --> 17:26.805
Simple as that? I'd fear a snakebite.

17:30.087 --> 17:34.205
Come up and fuck me, and I'll answer
every one you want to ask.

17:54.287 --> 17:55.436
Morning, Sheriff.

18:02.687 --> 18:04.325
You sober enough to listen?

18:10.247 --> 18:12.397
Did you just intend to insult me?

18:13.527 --> 18:16.246
- Excuse me, Sheriff.
- I know.

18:16.327 --> 18:18.363
You face business reverses.

18:18.447 --> 18:20.677
Like losing my fucking claim.

18:20.767 --> 18:25.522
People angry at their difficulties
often act like fucking idiots...

18:25.607 --> 18:29.236
but there'll be no murdering people
in this camp of any colour...

18:29.327 --> 18:31.636
or assaults on officials of any stripe.

18:31.727 --> 18:35.276
Even Yankton thieves who are in league
with God knows fucking who?

18:35.367 --> 18:39.042
Officials from Yankton or otherwise,
or thieves or not.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.876
If you can't live with that,
get out of this fucking camp.

18:46.127 --> 18:49.597
I can live with it. You have to keep
rubbing my fucking nose in it?

18:53.527 --> 18:56.246
Do not misconduct yourself again
in this camp.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.596
Must he take what the Sheriff
just fucking give him?

19:03.687 --> 19:05.359
Apparently so.

19:05.847 --> 19:09.237
He needn't.
Not by custom, not by fucking law.

19:09.807 --> 19:11.479
Name my remedy then.

19:12.207 --> 19:17.042
Outside every county courthouse
in the land is the lady blindfolded.

19:17.927 --> 19:19.599
True, far as it goes.

19:20.487 --> 19:24.560
To ignore how them scales she carries
sometimes gets balanced out.

19:24.687 --> 19:26.439
There, I take no position.

19:26.527 --> 19:28.597
I could take a leather punch...

19:28.687 --> 19:31.963
and stab the bastard's horse
in the fucking ass.

19:32.047 --> 19:34.641
You could, and you'd be in the right.

19:34.727 --> 19:39.084
Carve on its coat:
"Bullock, I fucked your horse... "

19:39.327 --> 19:41.716
and square the fucking scales.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.805
And if the blindfold was down,
see the lady a-winking...

19:44.887 --> 19:47.765
while she told you,
you done it like a man.

19:47.967 --> 19:50.686
And if I carve "fuck," I will...

19:51.287 --> 19:53.596
have fucked the horse beforehand.

19:54.407 --> 19:55.760
Preaching to the choir.

19:56.967 --> 19:59.356
- Thanks.
- Sure.

20:01.647 --> 20:03.524
Mingle the shit somewhat.

20:06.367 --> 20:08.119
You ought to take up whittling.

20:20.807 --> 20:25.005
Ready to receive currency, Captain,
in exchange for titles.

20:25.087 --> 20:26.236
Yes.

20:26.327 --> 20:30.605
And as I've learned to sustain discourse
while counting...

20:31.007 --> 20:33.726
I'm gonna ask you
to take counsel with me.

20:33.807 --> 20:35.160
In what regard?

20:35.247 --> 20:38.603
Well, first, let's agree them
Chink whores make a poor appearance.

20:38.687 --> 20:39.756
Yes.

20:39.847 --> 20:44.318
And as far as locales for fucking,
them cribs they're in lack allure.

20:45.167 --> 20:47.283
They might attract
the intended clientele.

20:47.727 --> 20:50.639
Now, that's an attitude right there
I want us to counsel on.

20:51.047 --> 20:53.117
Smart-alecky sort of attitude...

20:53.207 --> 20:57.997
and almost with
a quality of fucking anger to it.

20:58.087 --> 21:01.045
I don't find exact fucking words for it...

21:01.127 --> 21:03.721
but it fucking disturbs and concerns me.

21:03.807 --> 21:06.002
By my lights, I feel I manage well.

21:06.167 --> 21:09.364
Well, you can say that, Mr Wolcott...

21:09.687 --> 21:11.803
yet I hear accounts...

21:12.327 --> 21:15.205
that you're a dangerous lay...

21:15.807 --> 21:18.446
and that adds to my feeling disturbed.

21:18.687 --> 21:21.281
Are you inclined, sir, every so often...

21:21.647 --> 21:23.478
to ride one off the cliff?

21:24.367 --> 21:25.561
Girls, I mean?

21:26.847 --> 21:29.486
I am disturbed at my private conduct
being spoken of.

21:29.567 --> 21:31.637
Well, I should think
you fucking would be.

21:31.767 --> 21:35.123
And to think of Mr Hearst's disturbance
if he was to fucking know.

21:36.207 --> 21:37.435
Because...

21:38.287 --> 21:41.836
that's a dangerous habit to indulge
when you're not among friends.

21:42.447 --> 21:44.324
Are you my friend, Mr Tolliver?

21:46.327 --> 21:51.276
And someone past surprise at habits
or inclination, or turns of events...

21:52.447 --> 21:55.519
and who don't confuse himself
far as sitting in judgement...

21:55.607 --> 21:57.484
with our Lord in fucking Heaven.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.086
- I see.
- And...

21:59.167 --> 22:02.921
who would never tattle
to your employer...

22:03.847 --> 22:07.203
or jeopardise what's got to be
a handsome fucking income.

22:07.607 --> 22:10.326
Goddamn right, I am your friend,
Mr Wolcott.

22:10.407 --> 22:13.285
All I can't provide for the party
is the cliff.

22:14.527 --> 22:18.486
Believing yourself past surprise does
not commend you to me as a friend.

22:20.287 --> 22:22.801
A man inadequately sophisticated...

22:23.847 --> 22:27.123
or merely ignorant, or simply stupid...

22:27.687 --> 22:29.598
may believe himself past surprise...

22:29.687 --> 22:32.360
then be surprised to discover,
for example...

22:33.247 --> 22:36.876
that Mr Hearst already knows of my
inclinations and finds them immaterial.

22:37.727 --> 22:41.402
Suggesting, as a corollary, that your
skills for blackmail and manipulation...

22:41.487 --> 22:43.364
no longer are assets to you...

22:43.767 --> 22:48.045
and for your fatuous belief
in their efficacy...

22:48.767 --> 22:50.758
in fact, have become liabilities.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.243
In short, you've overplayed your hand.

22:54.007 --> 22:55.918
Now, I should think in consequence...

22:56.047 --> 22:59.244
now recognising yourself
as a man past his time...

23:00.087 --> 23:02.362
that during this last transitional period...

23:03.647 --> 23:07.083
you would devote yourself
with grateful and quiet diligence...

23:07.927 --> 23:10.566
to such uses as others
may still find you suitable.

23:10.647 --> 23:13.684
Oh, you bet I'm grateful.
A man like yourself...

23:14.567 --> 23:17.001
warmed at Mr Hearst's bosom...

23:17.087 --> 23:19.885
secure in his confidence and trust...

23:19.967 --> 23:23.801
taking the time and spending the energy
to persuade a relic like me.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.757
She'd placed adverts for a tutor
in Chicago, Boston and New York.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.038
The interests that employ me saw.

23:39.247 --> 23:42.603
- What was you doing at the time?
- Piloting a steamboat.

23:43.967 --> 23:46.435
Was Al right who hired you people
to fuck her up?

23:46.527 --> 23:48.199
That's not something I'm told.

23:48.287 --> 23:49.845
Must be the dead husband's parents...

23:49.927 --> 23:52.043
if they want
to hang that murder off her neck.

23:52.127 --> 23:53.640
That would make sense.

23:56.647 --> 23:58.683
Why does Swearengen hate
the Pinkertons?

23:59.007 --> 24:01.919
Beats me,
a stalwart organisation like that.

24:04.967 --> 24:08.323
Did you help send them miners
up the fucking scaffold in Pennsylvania?

24:08.527 --> 24:10.438
I was busy on the Mississip'.

24:18.567 --> 24:19.795
Past hope.

24:20.967 --> 24:22.844
Past kindness or consideration.

24:25.607 --> 24:27.040
Past justice.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.325
Past satisfaction.

24:33.567 --> 24:35.876
Past warmth or cold or comfort.

24:37.847 --> 24:39.166
Past love.

24:41.087 --> 24:42.566
But past surprise?

24:44.087 --> 24:46.920
What an endlessly unfolding tedium
life would then become.

24:48.447 --> 24:49.960
No, Doris...

24:54.087 --> 24:56.806
we must not let you be past surprise.

25:05.287 --> 25:07.403
Carrie's napping. I'll awaken her.

25:07.487 --> 25:10.638
You needn't.
I'd like to see this young lady just now.

25:12.087 --> 25:14.920
All right. Doris?

25:28.767 --> 25:31.440
Ah, teachers one remembers.

25:31.887 --> 25:34.526
The thrilling kindness
of the extra moment taken...

25:34.607 --> 25:36.837
the extra word
of encouragement offered.

25:37.207 --> 25:40.722
"You, young man," or "woman"
as the case might have been...

25:40.847 --> 25:43.805
"have an interesting turn of mind. "

25:44.927 --> 25:48.317
Yes.
And to take that extra moment in turn.

25:48.727 --> 25:52.686
Oh, Miss Stokes,
to alter a life's course with a word...

25:53.967 --> 25:55.764
how I revere you...

25:56.487 --> 25:58.045
your profession.

25:58.527 --> 26:01.246
- Well, thank you, Mr Merrick.
- No, thank you, Miss Stokes.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.477
And all teachers in you.

26:06.767 --> 26:09.235
There before you is the Bullock house.

26:09.807 --> 26:12.037
It was recently constructed
by Mr Bullock.

26:12.887 --> 26:14.798
These streets.

26:15.447 --> 26:17.165
I got to meet him, Wu.

26:17.647 --> 26:19.239
Cocksucker!

26:19.647 --> 26:21.524
San Francisco cocksucker.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.922
I have got to meet him.

26:24.127 --> 26:26.766
Swearengen,
San Francisco cocksucker meet!

26:26.847 --> 26:30.157
San Francisco cocksucker
and Swearengen got to meet.

26:30.247 --> 26:34.479
I've got to meet him, Wu.
I've got to see how much juice he's got.

26:36.087 --> 26:37.281
Jews?

26:37.567 --> 26:41.799
Yeah, I've got to see how much juice
San Francisco cocksucker's got.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.318
Jew? Jew?

26:50.407 --> 26:53.877
- No. No, Wu. No Jews.
- Jew?

26:53.967 --> 26:55.400
No Jew. Forget juice.

26:55.487 --> 26:56.761
- Forget juice.
- No Jew?

26:56.847 --> 26:57.836
Forget juice.

26:57.927 --> 27:00.839
No, Swearengen.
No San Francisco cocksucker. No Jew.

27:01.607 --> 27:03.006
Swearengen, Wu.

27:04.607 --> 27:05.881
Wu and Swearengen.

27:14.727 --> 27:16.399
Where are the other girls?

27:17.167 --> 27:20.523
Mooning over a dress at that store.
What is it?

27:22.567 --> 27:24.239
He's in a room with Doris.

27:25.647 --> 27:26.921
Wolcott.

27:27.367 --> 27:29.835
- Why is he with Doris?
- I don't know.

27:30.007 --> 27:32.601
- Well, why ain't he with Carrie?
- Carrie's napping.

27:35.247 --> 27:36.760
I can't imagine...

27:37.727 --> 27:39.718
what Carrie might have told
Wolcott about Doris...

27:39.807 --> 27:41.877
to make him want to fuck her.

27:42.807 --> 27:45.241
Maybe that she reports to Cy Tolliver?

27:45.607 --> 27:48.280
To keep Wolcott from bouncing Doris
off more walls?

27:49.567 --> 27:51.683
Look up from your fucking magazine,
Maddie.

27:56.687 --> 27:58.245
I would like to see Carrie now.

28:09.447 --> 28:12.245
Assist me in a flight of fancy,
gentlemen.

28:13.767 --> 28:17.077
Well, don't make me
think of Leon in a dress, Mr T.

28:17.447 --> 28:19.642
Or me of him anything but fully clothed.

28:20.807 --> 28:23.446
Mr Merrick appears before you.

28:25.047 --> 28:28.483
"Somebody's fucked with
my newspaper office," he says.

28:29.087 --> 28:30.679
"My presses are a mess.

28:30.767 --> 28:33.725
"My vowel trays are overturned,"
or the like.

28:34.007 --> 28:36.202
- How do you respond?
- Go fuck yourself.

28:36.287 --> 28:37.481
We don't know anything about it.

28:37.567 --> 28:40.400
If you ain't here to fuck or be fleeced,
get on your merry way.

28:40.487 --> 28:42.637
Good. Now, how about:

28:42.727 --> 28:46.242
"Referee's the only neutral
in a prize fight, Merrick...

28:46.407 --> 28:47.999
"and you ain't one of those. "

28:50.247 --> 28:51.680
We could say that.

28:53.367 --> 28:54.800
What would we mean?

28:57.687 --> 29:01.760
I don't know, fellas.
I do not fucking know.

29:01.967 --> 29:04.197
Well, if you don't,
we don't have to, either.

29:04.847 --> 29:07.725
I am saying, far as I'm concerned...

29:07.807 --> 29:10.719
your initiative and leadership abilities...

29:10.807 --> 29:14.083
and stick-fucking-to-it-iveness
are all in fucking question.

29:14.807 --> 29:17.560
And was I either or both of you...

29:17.927 --> 29:19.758
I'd consider this a fucking test.

29:21.367 --> 29:23.085
When do you suppose he'll show up?

29:24.167 --> 29:26.920
Once we've paid a visit
to his place, Leon.

29:28.207 --> 29:29.276
Oh.

29:31.167 --> 29:35.365
And aftermath,
when Merrick's path crosses ours...

29:35.967 --> 29:39.277
he'll hear of the "neutral"
and the "prize fight. "

29:39.367 --> 29:41.517
In no uncertain terms.

29:41.767 --> 29:44.406
And know the import
of that fucking parable.

29:46.807 --> 29:48.160
All right then.

29:48.527 --> 29:50.040
Got any sledgehammers?

29:51.127 --> 29:52.276
Always.

29:54.327 --> 29:56.477
- I'm going in there.
- No, you aren't.

29:57.887 --> 30:01.402
- He ain't the type to be with two women.
- I never took his full history.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.841
I'm saying he ain't.

30:07.247 --> 30:09.556
What are we to do here, Carrie?

30:13.167 --> 30:14.486
Get rid of her.

30:16.007 --> 30:17.406
They'll let you.

30:17.927 --> 30:21.806
I suppose they will,
but that won't dispose of the problem.

30:22.607 --> 30:24.006
What's the problem?

30:25.767 --> 30:27.166
I don't know.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.321
I can't say.

30:31.567 --> 30:33.603
I don't want you to have seen me.

30:34.607 --> 30:38.202
I don't care you killed her.
She must have done something to you.

30:40.287 --> 30:42.039
I mean something different.

30:43.767 --> 30:45.758
I don't want to have been seen.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.123
Then you're fucking crazy.

31:02.327 --> 31:04.887
And you're going to kill me
in this fucking shithole.

31:17.887 --> 31:19.878
Do you know how to make it not hurt?

31:43.127 --> 31:46.005
Now, I could cut off my arm.

32:14.087 --> 32:15.315
I'm going in.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.285
Your gun isn't there.

32:24.407 --> 32:25.601
I've got it.

32:40.327 --> 32:41.521
Go on, get out!

33:00.767 --> 33:01.916
Miss Stubbs.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.475
Mr Utter.

33:13.887 --> 33:15.798
What did you do, Mr W?

33:16.847 --> 33:19.884
Something very expensive.

33:21.687 --> 33:23.518
$100,000.

33:24.887 --> 33:26.115
For now.

33:26.727 --> 33:31.164
And more when I want it
for as many years as I live.

33:31.727 --> 33:33.922
For all the years of my life.

33:34.527 --> 33:36.245
Do you understand?

34:04.407 --> 34:06.716
There's trouble at my place, Cy.

34:07.727 --> 34:10.116
Where is Sheriff Bullock
when he's needed?

34:10.687 --> 34:14.396
Her last report to you,
did Doris speak of getting beat on?

34:14.726 --> 34:18.766
- That's the man making the trouble.
- Don't you fucking follow me.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.157
How much money you got, Jack?

34:25.687 --> 34:27.199
Don't put me
in the fucking middle, Joanie.

34:27.286 --> 34:28.800
No, I wouldn't.

34:29.967 --> 34:31.605
$1,400.

34:31.726 --> 34:34.639
Can you run to Mr Utter, Lila,
tell him to ready a wagon.

34:34.726 --> 34:36.159
Sure, Joanie.

34:37.687 --> 34:39.438
Go get your fucking money, Jack.

34:50.527 --> 34:51.676
Again.

35:00.567 --> 35:04.037
Open the fucking bag for him,
verify it's fucking gold.

35:04.767 --> 35:06.723
I know. I don't want it.

35:09.167 --> 35:11.203
Anyways, good meeting you.

35:22.327 --> 35:23.919
Come on out, Wu.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.121
Juice?

35:31.407 --> 35:35.036
If $20,000 don't tempt him to converse,
you're fucking-a-right.

35:35.127 --> 35:37.402
Maybe you and me
should be working for him.

35:37.687 --> 35:39.120
Wu, Swearengen.

35:39.767 --> 35:42.679
All right, Wu,
it's been a long fucking day.

35:43.007 --> 35:46.636
- No San Francisco cocksucker.
- Come on, Wu, Al's tired.

35:57.967 --> 36:00.356
- Hearst.
- What about him?

36:02.247 --> 36:03.726
San Francisco.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.203
You think Hearst
and the Chink's connected?

36:07.767 --> 36:12.522
You think he was born
looking down his nose at $20,000?

36:24.447 --> 36:28.565
Chief fact is, no witnesses are extant.

36:29.607 --> 36:33.998
The other madam was here
once when I came out, Joanie Stubbs.

36:35.687 --> 36:38.645
- Before you did this?
- Yes.

36:38.927 --> 36:41.395
When I came back out, she was gone.

36:42.087 --> 36:44.476
- Was she ever in the bedroom?
- No.

36:48.327 --> 36:51.000
Don't worry about the other madam.

36:56.767 --> 37:01.557
Go to the hotel.
Eat, if you can stand the food.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.917
This will all be took care of.

37:05.647 --> 37:10.038
I told you, Mr Wolcott,
all's I can't provide is the cliff.

37:12.007 --> 37:14.077
Go on now, get out of here.

37:21.967 --> 37:26.119
I apologise for bringing Trixie into it,
and calling her what I did.

37:26.367 --> 37:28.801
That wasn't new information to me.

37:33.087 --> 37:37.000
After you and me talked,
I searched that idiot Steve out...

37:37.087 --> 37:40.636
to rebuke him and smack him
in the face for being who he was.

37:42.447 --> 37:43.675
Sheriff.

37:46.167 --> 37:48.397
Tell me about your meeting
with Mrs Garret.

37:49.887 --> 37:51.957
She never once mentioned your name.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.679
She wants to form the bank
to better the camp.

37:56.047 --> 37:59.357
- And asked you to be involved?
- To serve as chief officer.

37:59.447 --> 38:00.721
You'd be a good one.

38:02.167 --> 38:05.364
I got the impression
that she might be with child.

38:08.527 --> 38:11.837
Lot, before God,
could make no case for that food.

38:12.087 --> 38:13.918
Lot's wife may have been in that food.

38:14.007 --> 38:15.838
Over salted as it was.

38:17.367 --> 38:19.642
I took that to be your meaning.

38:46.807 --> 38:48.206
Shit.

38:56.127 --> 38:58.083
Stay still, God damn it.

39:00.807 --> 39:03.241
While I come on your fucking leg.

39:04.127 --> 39:06.516
You're lucky I'm not fucking you.

39:17.927 --> 39:20.646
You tell the Sheriff
how that fucking felt...

39:20.727 --> 39:22.957
me coming on your fucking leg.

39:24.007 --> 39:27.795
Or that I saved you from an ass fucking.

39:29.527 --> 39:33.315
What else did you learn at that school
that teached you that?

39:34.447 --> 39:37.757
Mr Tolliver,
my office has been torn apart.

39:38.487 --> 39:41.001
- Hard luck.
- My press has been damaged...

39:41.087 --> 39:44.363
my vowel tray beyond repair.
And the newly-arrived schoolteacher...

39:44.447 --> 39:47.883
Miss Stokes, has been badly frightened
and has retreated to her hotel.

39:48.327 --> 39:49.840
Do we blame unsavoury elements?

39:49.927 --> 39:53.476
I regard this incident as postscript...

39:53.567 --> 39:55.683
to the visit
by County Commissioner Jarry.

39:55.847 --> 39:56.916
Interesting.

39:57.007 --> 40:00.477
Retribution for my refusal to associate
my newspaper...

40:00.567 --> 40:04.116
with Yankton's notice
on title to the claims.

40:04.327 --> 40:06.921
For pinning the notice, you mean,
on a wall...

40:07.007 --> 40:09.282
instead of printing it
under your masthead?

40:09.367 --> 40:11.437
That is my meaning exactly.

40:11.807 --> 40:15.595
Disassociating the Deadwood Pioneer
from what I took to be...

40:15.687 --> 40:17.678
the opposite of an effort to inform.

40:17.847 --> 40:21.476
Maybe if you had done your part,
calmed the fucking waters a little...

40:21.567 --> 40:23.319
instead of treeing
the county commissioner...

40:23.407 --> 40:26.046
the hooples would have gone
and got their loads on...

40:26.127 --> 40:27.765
and been waiting for your next edition.

40:27.847 --> 40:31.965
No, we differ, Mr Tolliver,
on the function of the press.

40:32.047 --> 40:35.005
Ain't the lesson for you in this, Merrick...

40:35.167 --> 40:38.716
that with fucked up machinery,
the press cannot function at all?

40:38.807 --> 40:41.605
And is that
the vandalism's purpose, sir?

40:42.487 --> 40:46.560
And of the dog defecating in my office...

40:46.967 --> 40:51.483
with ruffians dispatched by you
as the lesson's author?

40:52.367 --> 40:54.756
I doubt they had a dog with them.

40:57.807 --> 41:00.002
Hostetler, what the hell are you doing?

41:02.767 --> 41:06.521
- He was in here fucking a horse.
- I did not fuck that horse.

41:09.247 --> 41:12.045
I'm asking you what you're doing.

41:13.167 --> 41:15.601
I'm gonna go get a shoeing tool...

41:15.687 --> 41:18.326
and I'm gonna hit this bastard
right here...

41:18.447 --> 41:20.881
and I'm gonna drop him
like a piece of beef.

41:20.967 --> 41:23.083
I never fucking harmed you.

41:23.447 --> 41:25.358
Guess he ain't talking to me.

41:25.447 --> 41:28.484
I didn't kill you like he's fixing to kill me.

41:29.047 --> 41:31.322
You need to die, Steve.

41:33.287 --> 41:36.677
Hard as you worked,
as much shit as you had to eat...

41:37.087 --> 41:39.317
only way it makes any sense
to kill him...

41:39.527 --> 41:41.995
is if you sign everything you got
across to me first.

41:42.087 --> 41:43.645
'Cause then I could see the logic.

41:43.727 --> 41:46.958
I'm gonna kill him, then I'm fucking
gonna come back and kill you.

41:47.047 --> 41:48.958
And this isn't my will.

41:50.447 --> 41:52.597
Do you believe that God can act
through a nigger?

41:52.687 --> 41:54.917
God does not want you to kill.

41:55.407 --> 41:58.558
Do you believe that God
would let me feel mercy toward you...

41:58.647 --> 42:01.798
that tarred me and fucked his horse?

42:01.887 --> 42:04.196
I do. But I did not fuck the horse.

42:04.287 --> 42:05.959
Would you go hence in gratitude...

42:06.047 --> 42:09.642
if you received mercy in this stable?

42:09.807 --> 42:11.081
I would.

42:12.287 --> 42:13.720
Write out...

42:14.007 --> 42:17.158
"I fucked the Sheriff's horse. "
Then we gonna have him sign it.

42:17.247 --> 42:20.523
- I didn't fuck the horse.
- "I fucked-"

42:20.807 --> 42:22.638
I jerked off. I came on his leg.

42:22.727 --> 42:25.116
Would you sign off
on that slight exaggeration...

42:25.207 --> 42:27.323
to keep from getting your fucking head
smashed in?

42:27.407 --> 42:28.522
Yes.

42:28.607 --> 42:32.885
Would you bless coloured folk
and God that's father to us all?

42:35.007 --> 42:37.475
I would and go hence in gratitude.

43:05.127 --> 43:07.687
- Go hence now, Steve, go on.
- Now go.

43:08.007 --> 43:11.761
And if your gratitude ebbs, remember,
we got your signature.

43:11.887 --> 43:13.957
I'll go, and I'll remember.

43:22.687 --> 43:25.155
I took a drink of liquor
and it put me to sleep.

43:25.247 --> 43:27.966
How he got in,
how I got beside myself...

43:28.287 --> 43:30.084
I ain't took a drink...

43:31.487 --> 43:32.806
in 17 years.

43:33.407 --> 43:36.399
- Yeah, well, you're over that now.
- I don't want any.

43:38.727 --> 43:41.161
That tomboy get you that message?

43:43.487 --> 43:46.365
I owe you. When they come for you
like they did before...

43:46.847 --> 43:49.884
- you would have did like I did.
- Only quicker.

43:50.407 --> 43:54.116
- I appreciated the message.
- So be it henceforth.

43:58.767 --> 44:00.723
Was it a difficult day?

44:01.887 --> 44:02.956
No.

44:03.687 --> 44:07.316
Mamma met the new schoolteacher
and very much liked her.

44:07.807 --> 44:10.162
Mr Merrick brought her to call.

44:10.407 --> 44:11.760
Good.

44:15.647 --> 44:19.003
I liked her very much.
I'm delighted she's finally arrived.

44:19.087 --> 44:20.486
Good.

44:30.607 --> 44:33.201
I lack my accustomed stamina.

44:33.767 --> 44:36.156
Bullshit, Doc.
They've been coming at Al in waves...

44:36.247 --> 44:37.600
and he stood them all the fuck off.

44:37.687 --> 44:39.643
He'd have stopped Sherman
shy of the sea.

44:39.727 --> 44:42.639
Without the use of a leg, would they
have fired me from a fucking cannon?

44:42.727 --> 44:45.366
Well, I find you in excellent fettle.

44:45.807 --> 44:48.002
Relative to my former wreckage?

44:48.087 --> 44:52.558
Relatively speaking, yes.
All conditions are fucking relative.

44:52.727 --> 44:54.285
So how is this?

44:55.207 --> 44:59.086
- Relatively speaking?
- Better than this morning.

45:00.927 --> 45:03.157
All right, thanks.

45:03.607 --> 45:05.916
Poke a girl before you go, Doc?

45:06.527 --> 45:08.643
Well, change off rummaging their twats.

45:08.887 --> 45:12.516
I hope you ain't connected
with them new Chinese prostitutes.

45:12.647 --> 45:16.162
I ain't. But I did try to make friends
with their pimp.

45:16.727 --> 45:18.001
Yeah.

45:20.167 --> 45:22.397
- We need to muscle up.
- Local?

45:23.127 --> 45:26.802
- Don't know who's been bought.
- Well, send me to Cheyenne.

45:27.127 --> 45:30.164
You go. I want you close.

45:31.647 --> 45:34.081
I think I'll take a look outside.

45:35.767 --> 45:37.485
What about that forest fucking type...

45:37.567 --> 45:39.398
you used to maraud with
before you met me?

45:39.487 --> 45:40.522
Crop Ear?

45:40.607 --> 45:42.199
Yeah, he lacked the use of
a fucking horn.

45:42.287 --> 45:43.686
He ain't available.

45:43.967 --> 45:45.525
Yeah, didn't I hear lately, Dan...

45:45.607 --> 45:47.199
Crop Ear's been
marauding elsewheres?

45:47.287 --> 45:48.515
Yep.

45:48.607 --> 45:51.440
Let's not appear
as fucking triplets, huh?

46:03.327 --> 46:05.079
Go back down, both of you.

46:23.167 --> 46:26.796
Took some fucking portion
of the relative fucking weight.

46:32.967 --> 46:34.639
Come on, come on.

46:54.567 --> 46:56.523
Someone put a hand out.

46:59.687 --> 47:01.359
- Who got it?
- Enid.

47:01.447 --> 47:04.359
- Split it three ways, Enid.
- Thanks, Joanie.

47:11.207 --> 47:14.005
- Thank you very much.
- Certainly.

47:18.767 --> 47:22.919
It's $1,400. Split it three ways.
Never come back!
