01:11.001 --> 01:12.667
<i>We interrupt this program</i>

01:12.669 --> 01:14.700
<i>to bring you
an important news bulletin.</i>

01:14.702 --> 01:17.799
<i>The Center for Disease Control
has recategorized the pandemic</i>

01:17.801 --> 01:20.300
<i>first thought to be a super
virus strain of the flu.</i>

01:20.302 --> 01:23.000
<i>It has now been determined
to be a lethal pathogen</i>

01:23.002 --> 01:24.367
<i>seemingly capable
of reanimating...</i>

01:28.369 --> 01:30.034
Have you got
your ticket for tonight?

01:30.036 --> 01:31.999
Dad, I told you,
I've got work.

01:32.001 --> 01:33.599
You deserve a break, love.

01:33.601 --> 01:35.034
I don't need a break.

01:35.036 --> 01:36.500
You won't be saying that
next year

01:36.502 --> 01:38.170
when it's wall-to-wall
lectures.

01:39.634 --> 01:41.534
You heard back
from art school yet, John?

01:41.536 --> 01:44.499
Uh, no, not yet,
Mr. Shepherd.

01:44.501 --> 01:45.800
Is that normal?

01:45.802 --> 01:47.700
- Dad!
- Sorry!

01:47.702 --> 01:50.133
I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:50.135 --> 01:53.267
Hey, why don't you bring Anna
to the Christmas show tonight?

01:53.269 --> 01:55.301
I'm working!

01:55.303 --> 01:58.033
So is he.
John, you tell him!

01:58.035 --> 02:01.033
She can't, she's got to
pay off that ticket.

02:01.035 --> 02:02.700
John!

02:02.702 --> 02:04.300
What ticket?

02:04.302 --> 02:05.599
You said, "Tell him!"

02:05.601 --> 02:07.866
- I didn't say tell him that!
- What ticket?

02:07.868 --> 02:09.366
- It's nothing.
- Anna!

02:09.369 --> 02:10.666
I'll tell you about it later.

02:10.668 --> 02:12.367
What ticket, Anna?

02:12.369 --> 02:13.336
Just...

02:15.769 --> 02:17.435
I'm going on a trip,
all right?

02:17.437 --> 02:19.201
- When? Where?
- Dad.

02:19.203 --> 02:20.967
Well, I hope you checked when
university starts, because...

02:20.969 --> 02:23.034
I'm not going to uni!

02:28.202 --> 02:30.499
I'm gonna travel first.

02:30.501 --> 02:31.999
Just for a year, or maybe...

02:32.001 --> 02:33.600
Don't be so stupid!

02:43.834 --> 02:46.000
See you inside.

02:46.002 --> 02:47.836
Thanks for the lift,
Mr. Shepherd.

02:50.136 --> 02:51.699
You know this is
going to hold you back.

02:51.701 --> 02:52.700
Where are you gonna go?

02:52.702 --> 02:55.200
Australia first.
The ticket's open.

02:55.202 --> 02:57.101
Oh, well, that's all right
if it's open, eh?

02:57.103 --> 02:58.532
Think of all
the beautiful places

02:58.534 --> 02:59.767
you could get
mugged or killed.

02:59.769 --> 03:01.134
Stop trying to run my life.

03:01.136 --> 03:02.500
I'm not
a little girl anymore.

03:02.502 --> 03:03.799
Well, stop acting like one!

03:03.801 --> 03:05.135
If your mother
could see you now...

03:07.268 --> 03:08.466
I can't wait
to get away from you.

03:08.468 --> 03:09.468
Anna.

03:12.535 --> 03:14.266
<i>My parents went to Mexico,</i>

03:14.268 --> 03:15.500
<i>so I'm all alone.</i>

03:15.502 --> 03:17.100
I just thought
it would be nice

03:17.102 --> 03:19.167
to spend Christmas
as a couple.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.832
That's fine.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.835
It's fine. Forget it.

03:35.103 --> 03:36.836
My holiday
gift donation.

03:37.469 --> 03:39.001
Wait!

03:39.003 --> 03:40.036
Sorry!

03:41.435 --> 03:43.602
Don't! I got it.

03:45.436 --> 03:47.433
Do you need a hand
with these, Steph?

03:47.435 --> 03:48.702
No,
my car's right outside.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.502
I guess we're all having
a good day.

03:57.269 --> 03:58.899
You all right?

03:58.901 --> 04:01.933
Never seen your dad
like that before.

04:01.935 --> 04:03.866
You think I'm doing
the right thing, yeah?

04:03.868 --> 04:05.768
Yeah, it's great.

04:09.802 --> 04:10.835
Anyway...

04:11.369 --> 04:13.369
P.E. is calling.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.135
Yeah!

04:20.502 --> 04:22.168
<i>More snowflakes!</i>

04:22.170 --> 04:23.767
That picture's not straight.

04:23.769 --> 04:26.003
Drawing pin
missing, bottom left-hand corner.

04:27.369 --> 04:28.801
Miss North!

04:28.803 --> 04:30.199
Dropped the homeless story.

04:30.201 --> 04:31.466
It's editorial.

04:31.468 --> 04:32.967
You can't do that.

04:32.969 --> 04:35.366
It's a school blog,
Miss North, not <i>The Times.</i>

04:35.368 --> 04:37.799
Council sets our budgets,
so we play nice.

04:37.801 --> 04:40.167
Hopefully, get some
new computers.

04:40.169 --> 04:42.366
With all due respect,
Mr. Savage...

04:42.368 --> 04:44.134
I'm gonna go to Mr. Gill.

04:44.136 --> 04:45.300
- Be my guest!
- Cool!

04:45.302 --> 04:47.666
Headmaster Gill
is all but gone.

04:47.668 --> 04:49.835
Come January,
this school is mine.

04:51.002 --> 04:53.432
Oh. And as I told you before,

04:53.434 --> 04:55.600
park your vehicle
on school property

04:55.602 --> 04:58.336
and it becomes
school property.

05:01.501 --> 05:02.601
Give!

05:07.668 --> 05:09.268
Withdraw your tongues!

06:39.835 --> 06:41.002

Anna!

08:32.167 --> 08:34.366
- Hey, Lisa!
- Oh!

08:34.369 --> 08:37.600
What do you think?

08:37.602 --> 08:41.001
It's like Narnia
threw up over Oz?

08:41.003 --> 08:42.600
I know!

08:42.602 --> 08:43.666
Hold still!

08:43.668 --> 08:46.432
Four more cast members
called out sick.

08:46.434 --> 08:47.767
So we're going to
have to change

08:47.769 --> 08:49.433
the running order,
I'm afraid.

08:49.435 --> 08:53.766
Please try to remember that a
hand sanitizer is your friend.

08:53.768 --> 08:55.335
Kissing on the mouth

08:56.002 --> 08:57.168
is not...

08:58.936 --> 09:00.135
Your friend.

09:01.235 --> 09:03.001
You two!

09:03.003 --> 09:04.500
Why aren't you up on stage?

09:04.502 --> 09:05.966
I'm not in the show.

09:05.968 --> 09:07.401
Ah, Miss Shepherd.

09:08.536 --> 09:10.833
Your father
is doing my lights.

09:10.835 --> 09:13.967
When he has finished
cleaning the toilets,

09:13.969 --> 09:15.433
would you send him
my way, please?

09:15.435 --> 09:17.368
- That's not his job!
- Anna!

09:18.168 --> 09:19.802
It will be soon.

09:20.568 --> 09:23.199
Now where is my magician?

09:23.201 --> 09:24.201
Here, sir!

09:33.602 --> 09:37.533
I think it's about time we had a
little chat about health and safety.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.669
Everybody up on stage, please.

09:40.601 --> 09:41.766
Now!

09:41.768 --> 09:43.165
No, no, no!

09:49.035 --> 09:52.569
Get back on stage this minute!

09:55.802 --> 09:57.870
Flightless chancers!

10:16.602 --> 10:18.600
You are such a child.

10:18.602 --> 10:19.668
A sexy child.

10:21.536 --> 10:23.367
Wait, no.

10:23.369 --> 10:25.199
Goodbye, Nick!

10:25.201 --> 10:26.668
Hey. Come on, come on.
Don't be like that!

10:27.968 --> 10:28.835
Look.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.265
If you wanna hook up

10:32.267 --> 10:33.501
over the holidays, then...

10:35.301 --> 10:36.799
Skip off.

10:51.135 --> 10:52.532
Savage is losing it.

10:52.534 --> 10:55.002
He made Henry Lee cry
'cause he can't breakdance.

10:56.435 --> 10:58.266
Henry Lee has a prosthetic.

10:58.268 --> 11:00.336
And he only has one leg!

11:01.201 --> 11:02.432
Hey, guys!

11:02.434 --> 11:03.468
Yay! Boyfriend!

11:19.901 --> 11:21.133
Ignore him.

11:21.135 --> 11:22.834
Ugh. He's such a prick!

11:22.836 --> 11:24.433
I mean, yeah,
he's got a body you could

11:24.435 --> 11:25.767
- lick chocolate off but you'd have to have...
- Mmm-hmm.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.669
...like, no self-respect
to even think...

11:29.967 --> 11:31.666
I mean, um...

11:31.668 --> 11:33.201
Not you, obviously!

11:33.802 --> 11:34.802
The others!

11:36.034 --> 11:37.333
Not that there's been loads,

11:37.335 --> 11:39.734
you know, it's probably
all just rumors anyway.

11:39.736 --> 11:41.666
I mean, love me!

11:41.668 --> 11:42.869
Hey, guys!

11:43.968 --> 11:46.266
Chris. Uh...

11:46.268 --> 11:48.466
I need you to film something.

11:48.468 --> 11:51.000
Yeah? Cool.
I'll film anything.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.600
Savage keeps screwing
with the blog.

11:52.602 --> 11:55.599
So, um, I wanna bypass
the school completely

11:55.601 --> 11:58.200
and do a video.
Uh...

11:58.202 --> 11:59.633
If we go to
the soup kitchen tonight,

11:59.635 --> 12:00.866
I can have it in
before Christmas

12:00.868 --> 12:02.999
and actually show people
we have a problem.

12:03.001 --> 12:05.098
No! It's the Christmas
show tonight.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.336
And I'm doing a special song
about Santa!

12:09.669 --> 12:11.632
Our teacher said
you need something real.

12:11.634 --> 12:13.435
Um... This is real.

12:16.134 --> 12:18.834
I promise I'll make it back
for your song

12:18.836 --> 12:20.666
and Gran will be there.

12:20.668 --> 12:22.965
She's really excited
to see you, Lis.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.099
All right.

12:24.101 --> 12:25.068
Yeah!

12:25.935 --> 12:27.832
Thank you! Thank you! Cool.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.333
Yeah, um...

12:29.335 --> 12:32.102
Let's see that asshole
try and stop this one!

12:35.603 --> 12:36.667
Uh...

12:36.669 --> 12:37.769
Bye.

12:39.501 --> 12:41.534
Oi, Annie Lennox!

12:41.536 --> 12:42.998
Right. I'm going over there.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.332
Power down your lasers,
Iron Man!

12:45.334 --> 12:48.866
He doesn't have lasers!
They're repulsors.

12:48.868 --> 12:52.300
Well, Nick doesn't need help
being any more repulsive.

12:52.302 --> 12:55.169
Plus, you know it's not like
you could actually do anything.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.999
Hey, did you guys hear what
happened in science? Oh, my God!

13:01.001 --> 13:03.132
Gemma Brand called Miss Hutchie
a Nazi, then got all upset.

13:03.134 --> 13:04.500
She was sent outside,
'cause she thought

13:04.502 --> 13:05.932
Nazi meant the same as OCD.

29:36.667 --> 29:37.998
Hello?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.267
Can you hear me?

29:39.967 --> 29:41.432
I'm a first aider.

29:41.434 --> 29:43.097
I'm just going to
turn you over.

29:58.468 --> 30:00.034
Okay, mate.

30:00.934 --> 30:02.765
Mate! Mate!

30:02.767 --> 30:05.234
Call him "mate" again.
It's definitely working!

30:09.633 --> 30:11.701
- Stay here.
- You stay here!

30:27.766 --> 30:29.000
There's no signal.

30:33.134 --> 30:34.134
Anna.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.965
That guy's a zombie!

30:36.967 --> 30:38.198
There's no such thing.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.033
Right, because
that's perfectly normal!

30:45.366 --> 30:46.901
I can't believe
this is happening.

30:49.133 --> 30:51.331
This can't be happening.

30:51.333 --> 30:52.499
This can't be happening.

30:52.501 --> 30:53.997
Use your inhaler.

30:53.999 --> 30:55.965
When was the last time
you saw me with an inhaler?

30:55.967 --> 30:57.932
Don't have a go at me, just
because I said, "Use your inhaler."

30:57.934 --> 30:59.698
Because there's zombies!

30:59.700 --> 31:01.100
That's stupid!

31:04.834 --> 31:06.763
I never saw my mum
this morning.

31:06.765 --> 31:08.999
Did you see your dad?

31:09.001 --> 31:11.332
I should have
just gone to the show.

31:11.334 --> 31:12.998
I bet they're still
at the school.

31:14.267 --> 31:15.602
Shit!

31:23.233 --> 31:24.500
Maybe the Internet's
still working.

31:27.601 --> 31:29.298
But we can't go
all the way home.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.499
Do you still have
your work keys?

31:35.100 --> 31:35.934
Come on.

31:40.767 --> 31:42.968
Maybe it won't be so bad
across town.

31:57.666 --> 31:58.967
Potassium.

32:00.967 --> 32:02.466
It's okay.

32:02.468 --> 32:03.965
It's gonna be okay.

32:03.967 --> 32:05.534
Our parents will know
what to do.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.198
That's enough!

32:13.200 --> 32:14.798
Now, even though we had
to spend the night

32:14.800 --> 32:16.798
in the school, be assured,

32:16.800 --> 32:20.132
the government
will sort all this out.

32:20.134 --> 32:24.001
We have an army base,
literally on our doorstep.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.998
All that is required of us

32:27.000 --> 32:29.298
is that we remain calm

32:29.300 --> 32:31.099
and patient.

32:31.101 --> 32:32.831
If anyone has
any further questions,

32:32.833 --> 32:35.398
I've set up temporary
office space over there,

32:35.400 --> 32:37.334
adjacent to the fridge.

32:44.467 --> 32:45.764
I'll get someone.

32:45.766 --> 32:47.599
Doctors can't fix it, dear.

32:47.601 --> 32:49.967
Don't think your teachers
could do much.

32:50.967 --> 32:53.868
I'm just worried
about Christopher.

32:55.867 --> 32:58.265
He's seen, like,
every horror movie.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.601
He'll know what to do.

33:04.301 --> 33:05.632
Go.

33:07.633 --> 33:08.864
See?

33:08.866 --> 33:11.599
- Told you it was them!
- Have you been bitten?

33:11.601 --> 33:13.168
- Show me!
- They're fine!

33:15.966 --> 33:17.833
Hey, guys!

33:18.933 --> 33:20.466
Did you guys break in?

33:20.468 --> 33:23.501
Uh, the back door
was unlocked.

33:25.266 --> 33:27.597
That's the cleaner's job!

33:27.599 --> 33:30.366
Oh. Although, she might
have been concussed.

33:30.368 --> 33:31.764
So, uh...

33:31.766 --> 33:33.664
We were out filming
the soup kitchen last night.

33:33.666 --> 33:34.798
It was really good,
and then we...

33:34.800 --> 33:35.933
Then somebody screamed.

33:37.134 --> 33:38.268
Yeah.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.366
Hey, zombies, right?
It's crazy!

33:41.368 --> 33:42.701
I know!

33:44.701 --> 33:46.466
Excuse Anna.

33:46.468 --> 33:48.133
She's in Egypt at the moment.

33:49.133 --> 33:51.331
Because she's so far
in denial!

33:53.266 --> 33:54.798
You're not funny.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.065
Oh!

33:56.067 --> 33:57.498
- Boom!
- You guys heard anything?

33:57.500 --> 34:00.798
<i>Further updates now on
the unfolding global crisis.</i>

34:00.800 --> 34:02.331
<i>Reports of mass infection</i>

34:02.333 --> 34:04.499
<i>with the
as-yet-unidentified virus</i>

34:04.501 --> 34:06.664
<i>continue to come in
from across the world.</i>

34:06.666 --> 34:08.665
- <i>Sources at the UN...</i>
- Whatever.

34:08.667 --> 34:11.665
Big firm has been doing weird
shit for years. It's a cover up.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.197
<i>...historic proportions.</i>

34:13.199 --> 34:14.899
<i>Further information
and details</i>

34:14.900 --> 34:17.731
<i>of the evacuation program
can be found on social media.</i>

34:17.733 --> 34:19.232
Yeah, once it's safe,

34:19.234 --> 34:21.197
we're supposed to go
to the school.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.431
So the school's okay?

34:22.434 --> 34:26.331
Yeah. And the army's
going to escort us out.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.967
How cool will that be?

34:29.132 --> 34:31.530
- Shit!
- What?

34:31.532 --> 34:34.665
Justin Bieber's a zombie!

34:35.766 --> 34:39.699
Also, search "#EvacSelfie."

34:42.466 --> 34:44.098
- Look.
- Oh, no!

34:49.266 --> 34:51.867
Well...
We all deserve to go extinct.

34:59.867 --> 35:04.131
Oh! Bollocks!
He's definitely a zombie.

35:04.133 --> 35:07.465
Robert Downey Jr. has,
like, a bazillion dollars.

35:07.467 --> 35:10.164
He is in a hot tub right now

35:10.166 --> 35:12.799
surrounded by electric fences

35:12.801 --> 35:14.132
and models!

35:14.134 --> 35:15.932
Yeah, but,

35:15.934 --> 35:17.664
it just takes
one personal trainer

35:17.666 --> 35:18.797
with a bite and then...

35:18.799 --> 35:20.500
Uh-uh.

35:21.166 --> 35:23.298
Iron Man lives!

35:23.300 --> 35:25.464
What about Ryan Gosling?

35:25.466 --> 35:26.631
Doesn't matter.

35:26.633 --> 35:29.031
Alive? Dead?
The guy's still cool!

35:29.033 --> 35:29.998
Yeah.

35:32.300 --> 35:34.500
Um... Taylor Swift?

35:35.334 --> 35:37.232
Jesus, Chris!

35:37.234 --> 35:39.097
Why would you even say that?

35:39.099 --> 35:40.465
Tay Tay's fine!

35:40.467 --> 35:41.531
Yeah, all right, I was just...

35:41.533 --> 35:42.701
She's fine!

35:44.033 --> 35:45.967
Do you think
Paris is still standing?

35:46.901 --> 35:48.531
Yeah.

35:48.533 --> 35:50.430
French don't take no shit!

36:12.433 --> 36:13.601
Mrs. Hinzmann?

36:16.667 --> 36:18.198
Um...

36:18.200 --> 36:19.335
No!

36:53.932 --> 36:54.933
They're inside!

37:03.200 --> 37:04.700
- John?
- What do I do?

37:06.700 --> 37:07.898
What do I do?

37:07.900 --> 37:09.967
Destroy the brain
like in the movies!

37:33.432 --> 37:34.433
Get behind the table!

37:45.833 --> 37:47.631
Go, on three!

37:47.633 --> 37:49.033
Three! Two!

37:50.732 --> 37:52.530
I said "after three!"

37:52.532 --> 37:54.597
You said "on three!"
Think about your words!

37:54.599 --> 37:55.966
"Think about your words!"

37:58.967 --> 38:01.099
Fuck off!

38:02.901 --> 38:04.732
Fuck off!

38:04.734 --> 38:06.201
Fuck off!

38:18.000 --> 38:20.633
Can you...
Can you understand me?

38:22.034 --> 38:23.098
Okay.

38:33.201 --> 38:35.598
Yeah! Boom!

39:26.466 --> 39:27.631
Mr. Savage?

39:27.633 --> 39:30.165
Is... Is there anything
we can give Bea?

39:30.167 --> 39:32.965
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

39:32.967 --> 39:35.500
It's just 'cause she's got
a bad heart, so...

39:36.767 --> 39:38.467
Look around you, Miss Snow.

39:39.766 --> 39:40.867
What do you see?

39:42.366 --> 39:43.367
Um...

39:44.500 --> 39:45.664
Tables?

39:45.666 --> 39:48.333
I see civilization
on the edge.

39:49.667 --> 39:51.832
And what does civilization do

39:51.834 --> 39:55.034
when it finds itself
on the edge?

39:56.466 --> 39:57.797
We help each other?

40:02.332 --> 40:03.766

What about the army?

43:57.365 --> 43:58.666
See for yourself.

44:09.833 --> 44:11.499
Everyone's dead.

44:14.701 --> 44:16.000
People will still be waiting
at the school.

44:17.300 --> 44:18.364
We just need to get there.

44:18.366 --> 44:19.963
There's no evacuation coming.

44:19.965 --> 44:21.765
So, we'll get your car
and leave town.

44:21.767 --> 44:23.297
And go where?

44:23.299 --> 44:24.765
Well, I don't know yet, but
we'll figure something out.

44:24.767 --> 44:27.364
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

44:27.366 --> 44:29.664
You can do anything.

44:29.666 --> 44:31.032
I'm getting my dad,
all right?

44:32.801 --> 44:35.131
Yeah, and my gran and Lisa.

44:35.133 --> 44:38.197
I want to find
my mum too...

44:38.199 --> 44:40.867
But how are we even gonna
get past all the zombies?

44:50.600 --> 44:52.667
I've just had
the best idea ever.

45:00.300 --> 45:02.964
This is the stupidest
idea ever.

45:02.966 --> 45:04.698
We're all going to die.

45:04.700 --> 45:06.363
We should play a game.

45:06.365 --> 45:07.466
Take your mind off it.

45:08.432 --> 45:10.698
Helps me when I'm carsick.

45:10.700 --> 45:13.164
'Cause this is
exactly the same!

45:13.166 --> 45:14.964
- Steph.
- Yeah?

45:14.966 --> 45:17.397
Um... Marry, shag, kill...

45:17.399 --> 45:20.864
Zombie Miley, Zombie Rihanna,
Zombie Beyonce.

45:20.866 --> 45:21.863
Kill them all,
they're zombies.

45:21.865 --> 45:23.033
No, play it properly!

45:27.132 --> 45:28.797
Marry Beyonce.

45:28.799 --> 45:30.665
- Why are you killing Rihanna?
- That's not what I said.

45:30.667 --> 45:32.601
Well, obviously, you're shagging...

45:35.667 --> 45:36.601
Is it a horde?

45:38.800 --> 45:40.996
One, two, three.

45:40.998 --> 45:42.164
How many is a horde?

45:42.166 --> 45:43.132
Just check!

45:45.099 --> 45:47.365
Shit.

45:47.367 --> 45:49.530
I swear to God, if he says
it's snowing again...

45:49.532 --> 45:51.766
Uh, better.
Killer old people!

46:00.099 --> 46:05.832
What the fuck?

46:19.167 --> 46:21.598
Yeah, an old woman's
sitting on your face.

46:21.600 --> 46:22.633
Oh.

46:27.931 --> 46:29.131
Is she pissing?

46:29.133 --> 46:30.465
You're fine.

46:30.467 --> 46:31.597
It's plastic.

46:31.599 --> 46:32.866
It's warm plastic!

46:52.865 --> 46:53.866
Shit!

46:57.699 --> 47:00.099
All right, losers.

47:02.732 --> 47:05.467
If you were going out,
should've brought some muscle.

47:06.466 --> 47:07.534
Hi, John!

47:08.333 --> 47:09.597
Hi, Nick.

47:09.599 --> 47:10.930
Thought your big army dad

47:10.932 --> 47:12.298
would have pulled you a favor
and shipped you out?

47:12.300 --> 47:14.833
Don't talk about
my fucking dad!

47:17.033 --> 47:18.497
Show some fucking respect.

47:18.499 --> 47:19.565
Says the guy
who just murdered

47:19.567 --> 47:21.367
a whole bunch
of grandparents.

47:22.967 --> 47:24.431
Actually,

47:24.433 --> 47:27.097
can you get that on camera?
It's a bit of human interest.

47:34.765 --> 47:36.198
Ah.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.667
You've been looting.

47:38.300 --> 47:39.364
Lovely!

47:41.433 --> 47:42.932
Where is your dad?

47:44.766 --> 47:45.833
He went to the base.

47:47.566 --> 47:49.031
Sorry.

47:49.033 --> 47:50.799
Whatever.

47:53.600 --> 47:55.467
Shit! Get back under!

47:57.333 --> 47:59.200
Hiding's for pussies,
John boy!

48:00.699 --> 48:01.966
We are hunters.

48:03.832 --> 48:05.797
All right, boys,
what do we have here?

48:05.799 --> 48:08.763
- Are they, uh, excited?
- Yeah, mate. Use that.

48:08.765 --> 48:10.097
They're idiots.

48:10.099 --> 48:11.999

We can't let the ladies go off
without some real men.

51:18.999 --> 51:20.596
Hey, so where are we going?

51:20.598 --> 51:21.800
Somewhere fun?

51:28.699 --> 51:29.533
<i>People...</i>

51:30.799 --> 51:32.334
People,
you have to listen to me.

51:33.333 --> 51:34.829
We have to stay
in the school.

51:34.831 --> 51:36.163
You have to trust me.

51:36.165 --> 51:37.929
I've devised a 12-point plan.

51:37.931 --> 51:39.630
Arthur. We're on our own.

51:39.632 --> 51:40.633
It's time to go.

51:42.799 --> 51:45.297
We have emergency guidelines
in place for a reason.

51:45.299 --> 51:46.998
We have to hold out.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Enough!

51:51.832 --> 51:54.297
If you love this place
so much,

51:54.299 --> 51:55.765
you're welcome to stay.

51:58.032 --> 52:00.763
But I'm the headmaster.

52:00.765 --> 52:02.199
I'm the headmaster.

52:03.965 --> 52:04.866
I'm the headmaster.

52:07.832 --> 52:09.533
I'm the headmaster.

52:10.165 --> 52:11.166
I'm headmaster!

52:14.932 --> 52:17.263
Come with us, Arthur.
You can help.

52:17.265 --> 52:19.363
Don't patronize me,

52:19.365 --> 52:21.632
you fucking janitor!

52:25.765 --> 52:28.496
After everything
I've done for you all,

52:28.498 --> 52:30.166
this is how you treat me?

52:54.865 --> 52:56.966
This is my school.

53:06.465 --> 53:08.831
Reckon they'll use our stuff
on the news?

53:08.833 --> 53:10.766
It'll make my gran so happy.

53:12.700 --> 53:14.633
That's weird,
isn't it?

53:15.598 --> 53:17.165
I mean, like...

53:17.167 --> 53:20.331
You hear about riots and
revolutions in other countries,

53:20.333 --> 53:21.796
but not here.

53:21.798 --> 53:23.098
We could die!

53:23.100 --> 53:24.131
Hey!

53:24.133 --> 53:25.633
Well, we could, though.

53:28.167 --> 53:30.100
At least you won't be going
anywhere anymore,

53:30.798 --> 53:32.297
so that's something.

53:32.299 --> 53:33.300
What does that mean?

53:34.865 --> 53:36.497
Well...

53:36.499 --> 53:38.296
It's different now.

53:38.298 --> 53:39.699
You can't just leave.

53:46.465 --> 53:48.499
John, you're my best friend,
yeah?

53:49.498 --> 53:50.499
You know that.

53:51.531 --> 53:52.632
Of course.

53:54.999 --> 53:56.000
John.

53:58.498 --> 54:00.600
You're my best friend.

54:10.765 --> 54:11.833
Swap.

54:27.099 --> 54:30.664
Besides, nobody's dying.

54:30.666 --> 54:32.330
I'm going traveling

54:32.332 --> 54:34.097
and you're going
to art school.

54:35.165 --> 54:37.198
Yeah, because
abstract impressionists

54:37.200 --> 54:39.000
are super important right now.

54:41.633 --> 54:43.032
Oh.

54:46.365 --> 54:47.696
You really think
you can still

54:47.698 --> 54:48.999
get away after all this?

54:50.633 --> 54:51.766
Watch me.

55:01.466 --> 55:03.533
Could go through here.
Quicker.

55:04.666 --> 55:05.730
Plus, it'll be fun!

55:05.732 --> 55:06.965
Right, lads?

55:06.967 --> 55:10.530
Yeah! Certain death
is so much fun!

55:10.532 --> 55:12.330
Aw! Don't piss your pants!

55:12.332 --> 55:14.763
Pretty dark.

55:14.765 --> 55:17.063
Yeah, it'll be the same
out here soon.

55:17.065 --> 55:18.362
Look. We go through here,

55:18.364 --> 55:20.265
we might make it
to the school before sundown.

55:21.365 --> 55:24.198
Come on.
You know we've got this.

55:28.332 --> 55:30.499
All right. Fun way it is.

55:31.100 --> 55:32.833
Eh, can we vote?

55:34.533 --> 55:35.697
Yeah.

55:35.699 --> 55:37.031
Here's your vote.

55:37.033 --> 55:38.463
Live or die?

55:42.298 --> 55:43.299
After you!

55:45.366 --> 55:46.633
In you go! Go!

56:48.665 --> 56:50.629
<i>Have a Christmassy Christmas!</i>

56:56.699 --> 57:00.262
Guess there's nobody gnome!

57:08.698 --> 57:09.930
Oh, no!

57:09.932 --> 57:11.333
- Steph!
- Fuck! Chris!

57:18.033 --> 57:19.100
John?

57:20.365 --> 57:21.763
Fuck.

57:23.565 --> 57:24.997
Guys!

57:24.999 --> 57:26.763
Over there.

57:30.032 --> 57:31.198
Come on! Hurry!

57:32.199 --> 57:33.463
Jake?

57:33.465 --> 57:34.465
Tibbsy?

57:36.632 --> 57:38.100
Oh, fuck, guys!

57:40.398 --> 57:41.765
Anna!

57:43.266 --> 57:45.098
- John!
- Anna!

57:45.100 --> 57:46.296
Just get to the door!

57:46.298 --> 57:47.496
Where's John?

57:47.498 --> 57:48.696
- What are you doing?
- Where is he?

57:48.698 --> 57:50.964
Come on!
For God's sake, Anna!

57:50.966 --> 57:53.129
- What are you doing?
- Go, go, go!

57:53.131 --> 57:54.530
- Come on! Quick, quick, quick!
- Come on!

57:54.532 --> 57:56.296
Oh, no!

57:56.298 --> 57:57.964
- My phone!
- Chris!

57:57.966 --> 57:59.864
Are you fucking kidding me?
Come on!

57:59.866 --> 58:01.967
Move, move, move!
Come on, run!

58:12.032 --> 58:13.497
That was so stupid!

58:13.499 --> 58:14.499
I know.

58:20.198 --> 58:21.964
I'm sorry about your friends.

58:21.966 --> 58:23.697
Yeah, they should
have kept up.

58:23.699 --> 58:25.697
You should have
left it behind.

58:25.699 --> 58:27.664
It's just plastic and glass.

58:27.666 --> 58:30.266
And all my photos and videos.

58:32.098 --> 58:33.633
Lisa and Gran.

58:36.164 --> 58:37.665
They're alive, Chris.

58:39.199 --> 58:40.600
You don't believe that.

58:41.965 --> 58:43.599
You think
your girlfriend's dead,

58:44.198 --> 58:45.197
and your parents.

59:00.731 --> 59:02.465
What if everyone is dead?

59:03.599 --> 59:05.032
Then you'll think
of something.

59:06.799 --> 59:07.967
You usually do.

59:09.798 --> 59:11.166
It's actually
kind of annoying.

59:12.364 --> 59:14.430
We good to go?

59:14.432 --> 59:16.298
Or does John need
to change his tampon?

59:20.198 --> 59:23.499
I can really see why you
find him so irresistible!

59:24.531 --> 59:25.630
Shut up.

59:27.164 --> 59:28.165
Come on.

59:31.598 --> 59:33.163
Oh, by the way...

59:33.165 --> 59:35.663
I remembered the names
of all Santa's reindeer.

59:35.665 --> 59:37.063
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

59:37.065 --> 59:39.496
- You ready?
- Okay, ready.

59:39.498 --> 59:42.529
So, there's Dasher, Dancer,

59:42.531 --> 59:44.866
Comet, Vixen,

59:45.831 --> 59:47.296
- Cupid...
- Cupid?

59:47.298 --> 59:48.663
I know, right?

59:48.665 --> 59:53.098
Prancer, Donner,
Blitzen and Rudolph!

01:00:16.465 --> 01:00:18.631
Come on. Get up. Please.

01:00:18.633 --> 01:00:20.029
Get up!

01:00:29.798 --> 01:00:32.165
John! John! John!

01:00:32.966 --> 01:00:33.966
John!

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:37.764
John! John!

01:00:37.766 --> 01:00:39.333
- No, Anna, no! Leave him.
- John!

01:00:40.332 --> 01:00:41.962
Leave him. He's gone.

01:00:45.198 --> 01:00:47.330

Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:00:48.666 --> 01:00:51.366
No! Fuck! No!

01:00:52.066 --> 01:00:53.197
Hey!

01:00:53.199 --> 01:00:55.800
Hey! Your dad's
waiting for you.

01:00:58.965 --> 01:00:59.999
Yeah.

01:01:22.832 --> 01:01:24.199
Holy shit!

01:01:40.632 --> 01:01:41.800

01:01:57.032 --> 01:01:58.763
What?

01:01:58.765 --> 01:02:00.295
What are you doing?

01:02:00.297 --> 01:02:02.665
I am eating my Christmas
dinner, Miss North.

01:02:09.965 --> 01:02:12.365
I expect you'll all be wanting
to see your parents.

01:02:13.532 --> 01:02:15.730
You're very lucky children,

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.432
because they almost...

01:02:18.031 --> 01:02:19.032
Left.

01:02:34.965 --> 01:02:35.800
Thank you.

01:02:55.266 --> 01:02:56.696
It's locked.

01:03:12.265 --> 01:03:13.597
What the fuck?

01:03:13.599 --> 01:03:16.029
Do you know, Miss North,
for such a serious journalist,

01:03:16.031 --> 01:03:19.332
your vocabulary does leave
an awful lot to be desired.

01:03:20.632 --> 01:03:22.197
You're a teacher,
for God's sake.

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:25.763
Not so cocky now,
are we, Miss Shepherd?

01:03:25.765 --> 01:03:28.797
I can't wait to show your
daddy what's left of you.

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:30.162
Savage.
Please, please,

01:03:30.164 --> 01:03:31.131

01:03:32.864 --> 01:03:34.297

01:03:34.299 --> 01:03:35.830

I'll go get

01:05:42.032 --> 01:05:43.533
you go find your dad.
Meet outside.

01:05:45.165 --> 01:05:46.198
Savage!

01:06:07.599 --> 01:06:11.299
I didn't mean it about
your parents, and stuff.

01:06:12.664 --> 01:06:14.366
It's, uh... It's fine.

01:06:15.397 --> 01:06:16.999
I know how I am, so...

01:06:18.864 --> 01:06:20.695
Well...

01:06:20.697 --> 01:06:22.131
Whatever happens...

01:06:23.465 --> 01:06:24.599
You've got us.

01:06:29.632 --> 01:06:30.763
Listen.

01:06:33.466 --> 01:06:34.799

01:07:00.764 --> 01:07:01.765
Chris?

01:07:02.632 --> 01:07:03.632
Baby!

01:07:06.498 --> 01:07:08.029
Savage, he opened the doors,

01:07:08.031 --> 01:07:10.662
and we had to run, and there
was just so many of them.

01:07:10.664 --> 01:07:12.696
But, Bea, her heart...

01:07:12.698 --> 01:07:15.499
But we got her up here,
but her heart was...

01:07:21.264 --> 01:07:22.531
I'm so sorry.

01:07:28.731 --> 01:07:30.631
At least she's not
one of them.

01:07:56.298 --> 01:07:57.497
Bye, Gran.

01:08:14.665 --> 01:08:15.532
Shit!

01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:19.764
Hey, don't worry.
We'll find your dad, okay?

01:08:21.365 --> 01:08:22.962
Dream team!

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.265
We're a lot of things, Nick,
but we've never been a team.

01:08:26.596 --> 01:08:28.129
Hey...

01:08:28.131 --> 01:08:29.298
It wasn't me, you know.

01:08:30.663 --> 01:08:32.196
That night
you stayed at mine.

01:08:32.198 --> 01:08:34.130
I didn't say nothing
to no one.

01:08:34.131 --> 01:08:35.296
Wait.

01:08:35.298 --> 01:08:37.330
You think that's why
I'm angry with you?

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:39.763
Yeah, obviously.

01:08:39.765 --> 01:08:41.997
Nick, I don't care
about the sex.

01:08:41.999 --> 01:08:43.528
I'm angry with you
because we shared

01:08:43.529 --> 01:08:44.830
all that stuff
about our future,

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:46.799
and you acted like
it meant something,

01:08:47.663 --> 01:08:49.432
and then you just dumped me!

01:08:51.198 --> 01:08:52.765
I trusted you.

01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:55.131
Oh.

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:57.663
That's it?

01:08:59.497 --> 01:09:01.029
You are such a prick.

01:09:01.031 --> 01:09:02.962
Hey, look. Just 'cause your
little fuck buddy died,

01:09:02.965 --> 01:09:04.328
don't go taking it out
all on me.

01:09:04.331 --> 01:09:06.429
Don't you dare
talk about John!

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:08.698
What have you ever done that
wasn't just about yourself?

01:09:10.031 --> 01:09:11.031
Killed my dad.

01:09:18.964 --> 01:09:19.966
He got bit.

01:09:23.497 --> 01:09:26.129
So he gave me the bat

01:09:26.131 --> 01:09:29.497
and he said,
"Don't you let me down, son.

01:09:30.163 --> 01:09:31.464
For once."

01:09:34.198 --> 01:09:35.995
So I...

01:09:46.464 --> 01:09:48.096
Fuck.

01:09:48.099 --> 01:09:50.029

pansy bollocks.

01:09:50.031 --> 01:09:52.197

01:09:52.198 --> 01:09:53.362
