she'll dump your butt.

Esme, wait, wait.

- Leave me alone.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.004
What did you do?

08:25.838 --> 08:27.923
You wanted me out of your life.

08:29.299 --> 08:31.510
- You hurt yourself because of me?
- I get a bit...

09:23.520 --> 09:24.939

What? No!

09:26.857 --> 09:27.900
[scoffs] Do you think he saw it?

09:27.983 --> 09:29.276
He has, like, no social media.

09:29.359 --> 09:30.610
[sighs] Good.

09:30.694 --> 09:33.405
Uh, not good. You know who
doesn't have social media?

09:33.488 --> 09:35.908
- People with secrets.
- You're overreacting.

09:35.991 --> 09:37.659
He just doesn't like
living online, probably.

09:37.742 --> 09:38.911
What if he makes you start smoking?

09:38.994 --> 09:40.745
- Jonah doesn't smoke.
- How would you know?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.164
Because he doesn't taste
like a smoker, Shay.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.044
Tell me it was just a dream.

09:47.127 --> 09:50.047
- [Lola] You kissed him for real?
- [Shay] Why didn't you tell us?

09:50.130 --> 09:51.256
Was it because you know he's bad for you?

09:51.340 --> 09:52.757
No, that's not it at all.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.552
- Then are you dating?
- I don't think so.

09:55.635 --> 09:57.721
- He hasn't DM'd you?
- It's only been a couple days.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.931
"Days"?

09:59.014 --> 10:01.141
So he used your lips and
then just threw you away?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.268
[Shay] You can't become
one of Jonah's girls.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.603
He has girls?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.772
- Are you sure?
- I'm not not sure.

10:10.609 --> 10:12.277

Stop trolling Maya!

That dumb feminist kills Gamer Club
and gets to go on with her happy life?

11:20.429 --> 11:22.014
- Miles...
- Just...

11:22.097 --> 11:23.807
everything I touch gets ruined.

11:23.890 --> 11:26.101
[stuttering] And if anything
had happened to her...

11:26.726 --> 11:28.187
I just can't let her be another victim.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.819
Esme was there for me
when I was at my worst.

11:35.902 --> 11:37.196
She made you the worst.

11:37.279 --> 11:40.005
- She needs my help.
- You're right.

11:40.113 --> 11:41.532
She does need help.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.036
But from you, or a doctor?

11:56.881 --> 11:58.633
You realize you're getting suspended.

12:00.885 --> 12:02.596
And you'll never troll Maya again.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.058
- Totally worth it.
- [chuckles]

12:07.476 --> 12:08.852
I'm not gonna stop.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.730
[chuckles]

12:12.647 --> 12:13.898
What're you so happy about?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.775
You still have my phone?

12:16.046 --> 12:17.956
Password's four-four-four-four.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.824
Last video.

12:23.180 --> 12:24.516
Watch it.

12:29.831 --> 12:30.832
[Zig in video] <i>Are you sure?</i>

12:30.915 --> 12:32.584
- This is...
- You and Zoë.

12:32.667 --> 12:33.793
[Zoë in video] <i>Yes.</i>

12:33.877 --> 12:36.171
She should know better than to
store that stuff on her cloud.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.553
You can't show this to Maya.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.721
Can't I?

12:44.804 --> 12:45.805
She doesn't deserve this.

12:45.889 --> 12:47.974
You should've thought of that
before you cheated on her.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.601
Please. I'm begging you.

12:49.684 --> 12:50.894
Here's what's gonna happen.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.023
You're not gonna tell
Simpson or anyone else.

12:55.690 --> 12:56.900
And Maya never sees the video?

12:56.983 --> 12:58.568
Everyone wins.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.653
Except her.

13:00.570 --> 13:01.821
Do we have a deal?

13:05.825 --> 13:07.119
[playing piano]

13:13.667 --> 13:15.419
Hey, you.

13:18.713 --> 13:20.465
I wondered when I'd see you again.

13:21.758 --> 13:23.343
[stutters] Could you
step away from that piano?

13:31.393 --> 13:32.686
Uh, how's...

13:33.853 --> 13:34.938
how's this?

13:37.232 --> 13:38.858
Have you been with many girls?

13:40.152 --> 13:41.778
[scoffs] Like, in the same room?

13:41.861 --> 13:43.488
How many girls have you hooked up with?

13:43.572 --> 13:44.823
How many girls have you hooked up with?

13:44.906 --> 13:47.326
[scoffs] None. Why are you dodging?

13:49.119 --> 13:50.120
[sniffles]

13:51.037 --> 13:52.206
Frankie...

13:55.834 --> 13:57.043
Look, you...

13:58.337 --> 14:00.130
you are the only one for me.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.632
There are no other girls.

14:05.051 --> 14:06.303
Is that what you want?

14:07.387 --> 14:09.473
[scoffs] I just wanna know
if you're a good person.

14:09.556 --> 14:11.933
Ah, well, if I wasn't, it'd
be the last thing I'd admit.

14:13.643 --> 14:15.437
I can't date someone who
keeps secrets from me.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.026
Okay, since when are we dating?

14:18.440 --> 14:19.858
So you just go around kissing girls

14:19.941 --> 14:21.893
like some sort of... serial kisser?

14:21.971 --> 14:23.987
- Okay, you kissed me.
- You didn't not kiss back.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.489
Okay, was I supposed to buy you roses or...

14:25.572 --> 14:27.657
Yeah, or you could have called, or texted,

14:27.741 --> 14:28.950
or seen me in the halls and said,

14:29.033 --> 14:30.952
"Hey, person-I-kissed,"
like a regular human.

14:32.912 --> 14:34.998
What, no comeback? Figures.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.837
I've wasted enough time on you, anyway.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.256
I've got an exam to cram for.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.341
[bell ringing]

14:56.103 --> 14:57.312
How are you feeling?

14:57.396 --> 14:59.981
I'm kinda stressed about
this exam, to be honest.

15:00.064 --> 15:01.816
What was Hamlet's deal?

15:02.776 --> 15:04.569
You know, my therapist's actually...

15:05.529 --> 15:06.780
not the worst.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.199
Uh, congratulations.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.203
Well, do you want to meet him?

15:12.536 --> 15:15.079
Maybe he can help you.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.373
I already spoke to my shrink.

15:18.938 --> 15:19.981
And he let you come to school?

15:20.006 --> 15:22.217
He said I wasn't at risk
of further self-harm.

15:28.009 --> 15:31.930
Aren't suicide survivors kept
for psych assessment for 72 hours?

15:32.013 --> 15:33.014
[inhales sharply]

15:33.097 --> 15:35.559
The 72-hour rule is a common misconception

15:35.642 --> 15:37.561
perpetuated by the mainstream media.

15:42.482 --> 15:43.483
Come here.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.945
Let go. Let go of me. Let go! Let go!

15:47.654 --> 15:49.156
[gasps]

15:50.782 --> 15:53.202
- You faked a suicide attempt?
- [crying] I had to!

15:53.285 --> 15:54.869
You were ignoring me.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.830
I can't believe I let
Tristan down for this.

15:58.168 --> 16:01.171
Why are you always trying to live
up to his impossible expectations?

16:01.255 --> 16:04.384
- Stay away from me, okay?
- Please, I don't have anyone else.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.764
You're the only one who
ever let me feel normal.

16:09.847 --> 16:12.392
Like there wasn't something that
needed to be therapied out of me.

16:12.475 --> 16:14.685
Don't make this harder.
I'm trying to change.

16:14.769 --> 16:16.604
You don't need to change for me.

16:18.606 --> 16:21.191
Doesn't it feel like everyone
wants us to be someone we're not?

16:24.111 --> 16:25.112
Sometimes.

16:25.195 --> 16:27.031
There's nothing wrong with us.

16:28.073 --> 16:29.909
What are you saying? Huh?

16:32.953 --> 16:34.246
We should run away.

16:42.672 --> 16:45.340
Hunter and I had...

16:45.425 --> 16:46.967
a disagreement...

16:48.678 --> 16:50.012
and I lost my temper.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.511
About?

16:54.224 --> 16:55.267
<i>Call of Duty.</i>

16:55.350 --> 16:58.521
You got a three-day
suspension over a video game?

16:58.604 --> 17:02.107
Well, I really wish you hadn't,
Zig, because the trolls are...

17:02.191 --> 17:03.233
They haven't stopped?

17:03.317 --> 17:04.569
If anything, they've doubled down.

17:04.652 --> 17:07.571
[Maya] You being here was the
only thing that made me feel safe.

17:07.655 --> 17:09.073
What if something happens at school?

17:09.156 --> 17:10.907
Maya, I am so sorry.

17:10.991 --> 17:14.118
Yeah, well... I'm sorry you
can't control your temper.

17:18.415 --> 17:19.416
I need your help.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.835
I'd rather spoon out my eyes.

17:20.917 --> 17:22.962
[whispering] Look, Hunter is the troll.

17:23.878 --> 17:26.339
So that's why you hamburgered his
face. Why didn't you tell Simpson?

17:27.925 --> 17:29.301
He's got some dirt on me.

17:29.384 --> 17:31.053
The video of you and Zoë.

17:31.136 --> 17:32.430
You're letting that twerp torment Maya

17:32.513 --> 17:34.181
because you're a disgusting horn dog?

17:34.264 --> 17:36.434
Well, just until you hack
him and get the video back.

17:36.517 --> 17:39.228
Even if I did, Hunter's smart
enough to have offline copies.

17:40.229 --> 17:41.522
You have to turn him in.

17:41.606 --> 17:42.898
He's gonna release the video.

17:43.816 --> 17:45.359
I can't put Maya through more crap.

17:45.443 --> 17:46.527
[scoffs] Did you see her just now?

17:46.611 --> 17:47.820
That girl is having a perpetual meltdown.

17:47.903 --> 17:50.448
And if she finds out about
Zoë, it's gonna be worse.

17:52.825 --> 17:54.034
Who are you really worried about?

17:54.118 --> 17:55.453
Maya? Or yourself?

17:59.123 --> 18:01.125
- [bell ringing]
- [sighs]

18:01.834 --> 18:03.586
[speaking Mandarin]

18:03.669 --> 18:06.171
Excellent. I can tell you studied.

18:06.255 --> 18:08.466
Okay, one more question.

18:10.175 --> 18:13.262
- But I already did my ten questions.
- This one's a bonus.

18:16.641 --> 18:18.976
- [goat bleating]
- [chuckling] Oh, my gosh.

18:23.731 --> 18:24.982
[Frankie] "Snow Ball?"

18:25.775 --> 18:27.317
[stammers]

18:27.401 --> 18:29.403
I know goats are your favorite animal.

18:30.863 --> 18:32.197
- You guys were in on this?
- [bleating]

18:32.990 --> 18:34.784
- [chuckles]
- [Winston] So what do you say, Franks?

18:34.867 --> 18:37.161
- Go to Snow Ball with me?
- [bleating]

18:41.541 --> 18:43.543
How can you say no to a goat?

18:43.626 --> 18:45.085
[chuckles]

18:45.169 --> 18:46.754
- [bleating]
- [mouthing] I know.

18:53.678 --> 18:54.845
Do you want some tea?

18:54.929 --> 18:57.389
It's a fancy one my mom
bought me to help me de-stress.

18:57.472 --> 18:58.766
Uh... no, thanks.

19:02.338 --> 19:03.381
I'm sorry.

19:04.104 --> 19:05.523
You're sorry?

19:05.949 --> 19:06.950
For what?

19:07.011 --> 19:08.859
For guilting you over your suspension.

19:09.652 --> 19:11.946
I know it's not your job
to make me feel better.

19:12.029 --> 19:14.114
You've been the perfect boyfriend,

19:14.198 --> 19:16.075
and I've been such a mess, I...

19:16.158 --> 19:17.868
I haven't even been a decent girlfriend.

19:17.952 --> 19:19.203
You're not the bad guy here.

19:22.289 --> 19:23.373
I...

19:26.711 --> 19:28.128
I know who the trolls are.

19:28.921 --> 19:31.090
It's that nerd, Hunter,
and... and his friends.

19:31.173 --> 19:32.717
- I saw them.
- You did?

19:32.800 --> 19:34.677
That's what the fight was about.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.095
Why didn't you tell me?

19:37.597 --> 19:38.723
Never mind.

19:38.806 --> 19:40.474
I have to tell my mom.

19:40.558 --> 19:41.684
[Maya sighs]

19:53.626 --> 19:55.879
Mom, can I talk to you?

19:57.241 --> 19:59.284
Uh, does it have to be right now?

20:02.830 --> 20:04.665
I almost did drugs today.

20:07.042 --> 20:08.085
What do you mean "almost"?

20:08.168 --> 20:10.212
[stutters] Well, I really...

20:10.295 --> 20:12.381
- really wanted to.
- Miles...

20:12.464 --> 20:14.675
- did you relapse?
- No.

20:17.427 --> 20:18.553
[sighs] Okay.

20:25.310 --> 20:27.897
Today was supposed to be...

20:27.980 --> 20:30.482
a normal... easy day,

20:30.565 --> 20:33.235
[shakily] and I couldn't handle it.

20:34.612 --> 20:35.613
But you did.

20:36.238 --> 20:39.283
[inhales deeply] Mmm.

20:39.366 --> 20:40.575
Barely.

20:42.953 --> 20:46.456
What happens if next time I don't?

20:48.333 --> 20:49.835
I want to change...

20:51.754 --> 20:53.881
but I don't think I... I can.

20:56.050 --> 20:57.217
You need a fresh start.

20:57.301 --> 20:59.344
How is that even possible?

20:59.428 --> 21:00.971
We'll figure something out.

21:01.055 --> 21:04.183
You made it through today and I'm proud.

21:10.564 --> 21:12.399
My mom's on the phone
with the cops. [sighs]

21:12.482 --> 21:14.777
Thank you so much.

21:14.860 --> 21:17.196
Zig, you are my hero.

21:18.322 --> 21:19.782
I am not that special.

21:20.700 --> 21:21.951
Are you kidding? You're the best.

21:22.034 --> 21:24.453
I mean, thanks to you, we can
finally get our lives back.

21:24.536 --> 21:26.496
We can... we can go to that concert.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.290
We can... do other stuff.

21:28.373 --> 21:29.792
- [Zig sighs]
- [chuckles]

21:32.086 --> 21:33.212
I know.

21:34.129 --> 21:36.716
I can't believe it's
over either, but it is.

21:36.799 --> 21:37.925
Thanks to you.

21:38.008 --> 21:39.509
Seriously, stop saying that.

21:42.429 --> 21:43.597
What's wrong?

21:45.265 --> 21:46.266
[sighs heavily]

21:46.350 --> 21:48.352
There's something else I need to tell you.

21:49.895 --> 21:51.396
[chuckles nervously] You're scaring me.

21:57.361 --> 21:58.528
[sighs]

22:01.866 --> 22:03.242
Me and Zoë fooled around.

22:06.578 --> 22:08.622
It was when you and Jonah were in New York.

22:09.957 --> 22:13.210
And it was a stupid mistake,
and it meant nothing...

22:13.293 --> 22:14.920
and I hate myself for doing it.

22:23.637 --> 22:25.389
- Say something.
- I think...

22:26.585 --> 22:28.128
you should go.

22:30.144 --> 22:31.937
We should probably talk about this.

22:32.021 --> 22:33.313
Please...

22:34.481 --> 22:35.775
Just go.
