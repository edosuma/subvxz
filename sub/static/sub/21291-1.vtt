00:48.816 --> 00:52.246
- I guess I've been asleep
for most of my life.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.186
Oh, there were moments
of clarity,

00:54.222 --> 00:55.492
flashes,

00:55.523 --> 00:57.733
snapshots in time.

00:57.758 --> 01:03.098
But overall, a long slide
through dreamland.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.828
But wait.
That's me.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.437
I do remember that

01:09.470 --> 01:10.670
and that.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.574
Those were good times.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.575
The artist as a young man.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.411
The world was my oyster.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.320
But, you know,

01:24.352 --> 01:26.622
I wondered about it,
even then--

01:26.654 --> 01:27.864
the success,

01:27.888 --> 01:29.258
the adulation.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.790
Was it real?

01:30.824 --> 01:33.694
Did I deserve it?

01:33.727 --> 01:35.697
Or was I an imposter?

01:36.897 --> 01:39.167
I mean, I did the work.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.740
Well, I did some work.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.470
But when it all fell away,

01:44.505 --> 01:47.775
it was almost a relief,

01:47.808 --> 01:51.848
a validation of my suspicions
about myself.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.924
Then what are you left with

01:55.949 --> 01:59.189
when all that dries up?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.690
Alcohol? Women?

02:01.722 --> 02:04.392
I went there, big time.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.157
It seemed harmless at first.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.170
Then I almost lost it all,

02:13.201 --> 02:14.841
everything,

02:14.868 --> 02:19.568
even my lovely wife, Mary.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.937
Ask her.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.384
She'll tell you.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.581
I miss it.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.523
She knows I do.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.578
The glory days.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.919
So when the guys next door

02:33.954 --> 02:37.564
rented out their guest house
to Mary's pal Sherrie,

02:37.591 --> 02:41.731
I can't say
that I didn't notice.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.932
I mean, come on.

02:48.302 --> 02:53.712
But around here, it seems like
everyone's got their issues,

02:53.741 --> 02:56.381
even me.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.710
Because, I admit it,

02:59.747 --> 03:02.477
sleep,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.416
it can be nice.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.699
- Tucker, it's Warren.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.944
So what happened
to the deadline?

03:22.970 --> 03:25.770
To say we need to talk
is an understatement.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.786
- Can you get that?

03:40.454 --> 03:41.924
Sam?

03:50.063 --> 03:56.273
*

03:56.304 --> 03:59.474
- Is this yours?

03:59.507 --> 04:00.937
- It looks like it.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.584
- We heard you out there.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.581
- Where?

04:04.612 --> 04:06.482
- Outside the window.

04:06.514 --> 04:10.954
You degenerate.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.454
Next time, we turn you in.

04:15.088 --> 04:21.798
*

04:21.829 --> 04:24.599
- What was that?

04:24.632 --> 04:27.002
- Um, the guy from next door

04:27.034 --> 04:29.504
brought back our flashlight.

04:29.537 --> 04:30.797
- Oh, he borrowed it?

04:30.838 --> 04:33.668
- Not exactly.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.477
Is this ours?

04:36.510 --> 04:38.750
- I don't know.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.719
Ooh, I got to go.
I'm late.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.550
Bye.

04:46.053 --> 04:55.803
*

04:58.832 --> 05:06.772
*

05:24.024 --> 05:30.834
*

05:30.864 --> 05:32.904
- Here's your fucking
flashlight.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.543
- Hey, watch your language.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.068
- This is ours.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.573
You think I was spying?

05:37.605 --> 05:39.105
What's wrong with you?

05:39.139 --> 05:40.709
- Is there something wrong
with us?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.811
- Don't do that.
You're not baiting me.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.983
I got plenty of gay friends,

05:45.012 --> 05:49.552
and I'm not putting up with it
from you or your associate.

06:27.187 --> 06:35.127
*

07:22.009 --> 07:29.949
*

07:39.026 --> 07:40.826
- One, two, three.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.661
One, two, three.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.067
One, two, three.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.767
- Hey.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.044
- What you doing?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.742
- Nothing.
I'm just driving home.

07:53.774 --> 07:57.854
- Can I tell you again
how much I love this place?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.878
- Oh, I'm so glad.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.583
Hey, what about
the hot Italian guy?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.146
- He's still hot.
- Yeah?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.094
Like a meatball sandwich, huh?

08:06.119 --> 08:09.519
- Meaty and sweaty and--

08:09.557 --> 08:12.057
- Okay, all right, got it.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.792
Can't wait to meet him.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.711
Sam.

08:26.740 --> 08:31.040
Sam, we--we're gonna be late.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.778
- She's my sister, so...

08:36.082 --> 08:37.993
- She's done a really good job.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.616
- You one of the staff here?

08:41.655 --> 08:43.554
- Oh, my wife.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.191
Just recently.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.255
- Congratulations.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.304
- She just renewed her license.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.929
- The one with the orange?

08:50.964 --> 08:52.604
- Mm-hmm.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.744
- Everyone seems
to really like her.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.584
- I'm Sam.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.823
- Mike.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.578
- What's your connection here?

09:10.618 --> 09:13.048
- Senior Therapist.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.756
*

09:15.789 --> 09:17.119
I retire in two months.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.327
- Good for you.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.988
- Thanks.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.898
- Although I don't know if I'd
ever personally use that word--

09:23.931 --> 09:26.001
retirement.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.703
A lot of people
would say I'm retired already.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.236
Nothing much would change,
so...

09:30.270 --> 09:32.740
Are you looking forward to--

09:32.773 --> 09:40.613
*

09:45.218 --> 09:47.288
- Did you have a good time?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.720
- It's not really my crowd.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.687
- Yeah, what's your crowd?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.026
- Good point.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.732
You?

09:56.764 --> 10:00.274
- I did. I had a nice time.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.170
- You're sure you're okay
with it,

10:02.202 --> 10:04.302
going back to work?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.367
- Oh, Sam, come on.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.736
I'm working,

10:08.776 --> 10:10.906
and I'm excited.

10:13.947 --> 10:22.187
*

10:29.863 --> 10:31.933
- Come on.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.265
Don't be stupid.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.000
- Don't insult me.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.436
- Things won't always
be so good.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.911
- You think I don't know that?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.310
- So appreciate it.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.011
- I need more.
- Than a roof over your head?

10:43.043 --> 10:44.283
- You know
what I'm talking about.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.781
You know exactly!

10:48.481 --> 10:50.681
- But we're doing fine.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.748
We're doing so well.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.885
- "So well" falls very short.

10:59.092 --> 11:03.702
*

11:05.833 --> 11:09.843
*

11:26.186 --> 11:28.456
- Tucker, it's Warren.

11:28.488 --> 11:32.228
I'm taking some real heat here.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.429
They're gonna kick it
over to legal.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.502
I can't protect you,

11:37.530 --> 11:39.770
not this time.

11:41.902 --> 11:46.012
- Sam, I thought you said
you were gonna call him back.

11:46.039 --> 11:50.009
- Oh, I did.
I, um, I left him a message.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.443
- Legal?

11:51.478 --> 11:52.878
- He exaggerates.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.923
He's an agent.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.790
- All right, have a good day.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.219
- You too.

12:09.062 --> 12:17.002
*

12:40.327 --> 12:43.357
*

12:46.399 --> 12:54.339
*

13:04.351 --> 13:06.551
- Hi.

13:06.586 --> 13:10.286
I came to apologize.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.993
- Don't worry about it.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.555
- That flashlight could have
been there for a while.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.333
The batteries were dead.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.403
Maybe we heard a skunk.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.973
I'm on my way
to the post office,

13:25.005 --> 13:27.975
but to make amends,
may I buy you a coffee?

13:35.382 --> 13:36.982
- Jane.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.917
Hi, I'm Mary Tucker.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.292
Do you want to come on in?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.104
Okay, I'm gonna step back
in my office.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.329
You come in when you're ready.

14:01.108 --> 14:09.048
*

14:11.919 --> 14:14.149
- So you're the wife,
like me?

14:14.187 --> 14:17.387
- Well, I'm not sure
I would describe it like that.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.164
- No, no, no, of course not.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.533
- But Paul would.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.403
And the crazy thing...

14:25.432 --> 14:29.002
I have no idea
how I arrived here.

14:29.036 --> 14:32.036
Paul, Paul has a job.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.612
Paul has a life.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.410
- You don't have a life?

14:36.443 --> 14:37.443
- I suppose I do,

14:37.477 --> 14:39.977
but...boring.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.379
- What's your thing?

14:44.417 --> 14:45.617
- Literature.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.522
Critical studies.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.164
But my dream...

14:50.190 --> 14:53.360
photography, fine art.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.233
I'll own a gallery someday.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.132
- That's pretty specific.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.604
Did you study it?

14:58.631 --> 15:03.241
- No, but I've got applications
everywhere.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.510
Paul has friends in high places,

15:05.538 --> 15:10.208
but he needs me at home.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.246
But enough about me.

15:15.282 --> 15:19.322
What about you that you can be
at the house so much?

15:19.352 --> 15:23.262
- Oh, I stay pretty busy.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.360
- And if you don't mind
my asking...

15:26.393 --> 15:28.563
- I write.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.195
- How exciting.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.570
- Graphic novels.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.299
- Anything I might have seen?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.335
- Well, my first,
some years ago,

15:37.370 --> 15:39.640
was called Grand Central.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.712
- Oh, my God.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.681
Sam Tucker?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.711
What happened?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.376
- What?

15:48.415 --> 15:52.285
- You know what they say,
Never meet your heroes.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.349
- That doesn't sound good.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.757
- You were a chapter
of my dissertation.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.329
I devoured you.

16:01.228 --> 16:05.028
Until Bluebird.

16:05.065 --> 16:08.495
- Ha, fair enough.

16:08.535 --> 16:13.335
- So what are you
working on now?

16:13.373 --> 16:16.013
- Truthfully?

16:16.043 --> 16:19.213
- Of course.

16:19.246 --> 16:22.216
- Nothing.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.349
- I don't understand.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.024
- I'm kind of stuck right now.

16:30.057 --> 16:33.027
Howie sits.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.430
- Howie?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.501
- My protagonist.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.039
- So let's talk about it.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.269
- Talk?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.543
- Of course.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.111
- Um, excuse me.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.508
Hello.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.376
- Hey, how's your day going?

16:55.415 --> 16:56.445
- Good.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.653
- Yeah, what are you doing?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.424
- Slogging along.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.222
- What's that noise?

17:02.255 --> 17:04.285
- I came down to the crossing.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.394
- With your laptop?

17:06.425 --> 17:07.656
- Yeah.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.434
- Does that battery work?

17:09.462 --> 17:12.301
- I plugged it in.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.502
- You sound weird.

17:13.532 --> 17:17.843
- Will you stop saying that?

17:20.873 --> 17:28.823
*

17:45.665 --> 17:53.605
*

18:20.200 --> 18:22.770
*

18:25.805 --> 18:30.835
*

18:52.799 --> 18:54.129
Good night.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.438
- Night.

19:25.632 --> 19:34.642
*

19:34.674 --> 19:36.944
Okay, Howie, give it up.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.976
*

19:39.011 --> 19:40.311
You got anything?

19:40.347 --> 19:47.617
*

19:49.021 --> 19:50.791
*

20:02.935 --> 20:05.435
*

20:08.675 --> 20:09.635
*

20:11.811 --> 20:13.651
*

20:15.315 --> 20:21.845
*

20:26.659 --> 20:30.259
*

20:33.300 --> 20:35.370
*

20:38.405 --> 20:46.345
*

21:05.632 --> 21:13.672
*

22:37.757 --> 22:45.697
*

23:14.827 --> 23:20.597
*

23:35.147 --> 23:36.977
- Oh.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.919
- Today we're making
peppered pork

23:41.954 --> 23:43.794
with a cognac pan sauce.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.963
So let's start
with our fresh ingredients,

23:45.992 --> 23:48.562
a mÃ©lange of peppercorns,
fennel,

23:48.595 --> 23:51.155
garlic, vegetable oil,
sea salt,

23:51.197 --> 23:54.527
and a flawless
5-pound pork butt.

23:58.805 --> 24:02.705
- Oh. Ah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:02.742 --> 24:03.982
- Oh, yeah.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.040
Oh!

24:06.779 --> 24:08.679
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.845
Oh, yeah.

24:14.754 --> 24:17.024
- It's Warren.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.826
So they did it.
It's with legal.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.689
They're gonna sue.

24:21.728 --> 24:25.698
They want your advance back
and now damages on top.

24:25.732 --> 24:30.602
You could have prevented this
any number of ways.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.807
I'd appreciate any kind
of goddamn response.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.877
*

24:41.881 --> 24:46.691
*

25:14.714 --> 25:18.954
- So what's this about, Sam?

25:18.985 --> 25:21.815
Do you like what you see?

25:24.056 --> 25:26.886
- I have no idea
how to answer that.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.966
- You feeling a little funny
in your pants?

25:52.251 --> 25:54.351
Sam?

25:59.391 --> 26:03.361
*

26:03.395 --> 26:05.965
What are you doing in there?

26:05.998 --> 26:07.368
*

26:11.771 --> 26:13.071
*

26:15.174 --> 26:18.284
*

26:29.188 --> 26:35.758
*

26:37.263 --> 26:40.773
*

26:40.800 --> 26:43.640
- Hey, Tucker.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.140
The usual?

26:45.171 --> 26:46.371
- Make it a double.

26:46.405 --> 26:52.845
*

26:52.879 --> 26:54.779
- You okay, man?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.784
- Yeah, you know.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.046
I just woke up.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.685
- That's the life.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.020
*

27:07.059 --> 27:11.799
*

27:11.831 --> 27:14.801
- Found it.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.174
The dissertation.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.709
"After his first two works
were largely overlooked,

27:22.742 --> 27:26.182
"Samuel Tucker began to fear
that there was no appreciation

27:26.212 --> 27:27.882
"for the serious artist

27:27.914 --> 27:31.754
"in a culture obsessed
with constant stimulation.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.354
"So the agenda for
the third book, Bluebird Sky,

27:34.386 --> 27:37.756
"a collaboration
with then novice Andrew Koch,

27:37.790 --> 27:40.760
"was to dumb it down
and to incorporate

27:40.793 --> 27:43.703
"humorous reportage
on contemporary society

27:43.730 --> 27:47.270
"along with more broadly
drawn characters.

27:47.299 --> 27:50.869
"The novel was overshadowed
by the derivative motion picture

27:50.903 --> 27:52.873
"which opened to mixed reviews,

27:52.905 --> 27:56.035
"but they attracted
a crass mass-market audience,

27:56.075 --> 27:58.845
which was not at all the kind
of following Tucker coveted."

27:58.878 --> 27:59.908
- Wait a minute.

27:59.946 --> 28:02.246
You make me sound...

28:02.281 --> 28:03.981
elitist.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.216
- Hello.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.261
Did you meet the actors?

28:11.290 --> 28:13.390
- I refused to go to the set.
- You dolt.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.485
- It was sophomoric.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.996
- Parts were so funny.

28:16.028 --> 28:19.028
The miniature golf scene,
come on.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.395
- Fine.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.444
I love miniature golf.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.417
*

28:37.449 --> 28:38.849
- Shit.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.515
Now what?

28:40.552 --> 28:41.922
- Like the nice man
that you are,

28:41.954 --> 28:43.194
you wait for my turn.

28:43.222 --> 28:51.162
*

28:55.367 --> 28:57.867
- Yeah.
- What the hell?

28:57.904 --> 29:00.114
- I thought
you were good at this.

29:19.992 --> 29:25.162
- You know, Paul and I have
such a hard time making friends.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.167
- How did you meet?

29:27.199 --> 29:29.939
- Online.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.999
- How long has it been?

29:32.038 --> 29:35.568
- Two years, a month,
four days.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.177
- And you hit a rough patch.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.888
- I'm holding on
to someone else.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.362
- Who?

29:54.593 --> 29:56.233
- My darling, Jack.

30:01.868 --> 30:04.098
Now the bastard sends an email.

30:13.279 --> 30:22.189
*

30:25.224 --> 30:33.174
*

30:40.372 --> 30:42.342
- Hey.

30:42.374 --> 30:48.584
*

30:48.614 --> 30:51.224
- Wow.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.450
- When was the last time
I told you

30:52.484 --> 30:55.554
how much I appreciate you?

30:55.587 --> 30:57.987
- I can't remember.

30:58.024 --> 31:01.194
- That's exactly what I thought.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.357
Peppered pork.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.355
- Nice.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.667
*

31:07.699 --> 31:10.539
Looks like you're enjoying
yourself.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.999
They're good.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.068
- You know what?
I am.

31:14.106 --> 31:17.976
I had a pretty good day.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.380
- How much have you had?

31:21.413 --> 31:22.453
- There's the bottle.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.921
Check it out.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.922
- Sorry.

31:29.521 --> 31:30.521
Can I help?

31:30.556 --> 31:32.186
- Suit yourself.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.528
- I'll set the table.

31:49.441 --> 31:57.381
*

32:02.388 --> 32:03.388
- Hey.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.262
- Hey, were you home today?

32:06.292 --> 32:08.962
- I was.

32:08.995 --> 32:12.495
- Did you notice anything?

32:12.531 --> 32:14.031
- What do you mean?

32:14.066 --> 32:16.066
- At our house.

32:16.102 --> 32:20.572
- Uh, no.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.666
- Sam's acting weird.

32:22.708 --> 32:26.378
*

32:26.412 --> 32:29.482
There was this lip gloss.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.545
- That is weird.

32:30.582 --> 32:34.452
- Yeah, and two tea cups.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.356
- Hmm.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.558
- Passionate Peach.

32:40.026 --> 32:43.056
That is not something
I would use.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.755
- So it wasn't you.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.097
- Well,
I did come by for a beer.

32:49.135 --> 32:52.195
- A beer?

32:52.238 --> 32:55.268
- Mar, Sam,

32:55.307 --> 32:59.247
he seems so depressed.

32:59.278 --> 33:02.448
He's at that age where he wants
to shake it while he can,

33:02.481 --> 33:05.521
make hay, wild oats,

33:05.551 --> 33:09.291
you know, or at least feel
like he could.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.623
Can he?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.188
- That's really personal.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.786
Of course he can.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.327
- I'll be honest.
I've thought about it.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.374
I have.
- Thought about what?

33:20.399 --> 33:21.569
- Sex.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.300
- With my husband?

33:23.335 --> 33:26.365
- Come on.
It's just a fantasy.

33:26.405 --> 33:27.805
- Okay, you know what?
Forget about it.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.109
Clearly I can see
this was a mistake.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.183
- Why?

33:33.212 --> 33:34.212
- You're still a mess.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.092
- Bon appÃ©tit.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.727
- Cheers.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.470
- Did something happen at work?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.370
- No, work's fine.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.207
It's good, actually.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.623
Are you depressed?

34:16.655 --> 34:19.385
- Do I look depressed?

34:19.425 --> 34:22.324
- You do have
some of the symptoms.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.130
- Okay.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.766
- All right, look.
Here's the deal.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.440
Is there something
that you need to tell me?

34:31.469 --> 34:33.510
I mean, I don't know.

34:33.539 --> 34:37.239
Is something going on?

34:37.275 --> 34:38.676
- No.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.545
- Are you sure?

34:48.187 --> 34:49.487
What's this?

34:49.521 --> 34:50.721
- Oh, that.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.626
It's, um, you know, Jeff.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.329
- Jeff?
- Next door.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.170
- Is that the truth?

35:00.199 --> 35:02.499
- Of course it's the truth.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.544
- And Sherrie?

35:04.570 --> 35:05.540
- Yeah.

35:05.571 --> 35:08.711
I mean...she stopped by.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.380
- Why?

35:10.409 --> 35:12.879
- I don't know.
She was just doing her thing.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.551
- Yeah?
What were you doing?

35:14.580 --> 35:17.550
- Come on.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.253
I mean, there's flirtation
there, of course.

35:20.286 --> 35:23.386
I admit it, but it's flattering,

35:23.422 --> 35:27.262
nothing more.

35:27.293 --> 35:30.233
Are you okay?

35:30.262 --> 35:32.262
- I don't know.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.568
Am I?

35:35.934 --> 35:38.474
- It's harmless.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.306
- I'm not hungry.

35:48.414 --> 35:51.454
Well, that went well.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.230
- Hi.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.465
- Hi.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.900
- Today's the 15th.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.366
- It's the 16th over here.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.235
- I can't wait
to see you tomorrow.

36:15.274 --> 36:17.484
- Me too.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.579
Well, I was just
leaving the apartment, Sherrie.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.351
I'm sorry.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.381
You know,
so much to do before I leave.

36:27.753 --> 36:28.953
- That's okay.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.387
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.433
- Ciao.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.428
- Ciao.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.323
- So can we talk
when I get home tonight?

36:56.348 --> 36:57.518
- Absolutely.

37:01.287 --> 37:04.257
- All right.
I got to go.

37:04.290 --> 37:07.390
- Well, skedaddle.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.796
- So have a good day.

37:09.828 --> 37:13.298
Hey, Sam, I mean that.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.472
- You too.

37:23.442 --> 37:31.452
*

37:55.106 --> 38:03.046
*

38:06.452 --> 38:09.022
- How are you doing today?

38:11.890 --> 38:13.760
Mostly...

38:13.792 --> 38:18.462
I just hate you.

38:18.497 --> 38:20.967
- What do you hate about me?

38:20.999 --> 38:24.569
*

38:24.603 --> 38:25.673
Okay.

38:25.704 --> 38:33.654
*

38:35.947 --> 38:38.717
I like your chain.
I noticed it earlier.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.120
*

38:41.152 --> 38:43.522
But it's broken.
What does that mean?

38:43.555 --> 38:48.985
*

38:49.027 --> 38:51.497
- Freedom.

38:51.530 --> 38:59.910
*

38:59.938 --> 39:02.038
- It was groundbreaking,

39:02.073 --> 39:03.443
in regards to the style

39:03.475 --> 39:05.035
and the kind of stories
you told.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.406
- Drover Boy?

39:07.446 --> 39:10.546
It was about a cattle drive
in the Australian Outback.

39:10.582 --> 39:14.392
- Such a sweeping,
romantic canvas.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.560
The crossing
of an entire continent

39:16.588 --> 39:18.558
while searching for the boy.

39:18.590 --> 39:19.590
- Who is a girl.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.755
- Dressed as a boy.

39:21.793 --> 39:24.003
Believe me,
when you're 17 and coming out,

39:24.029 --> 39:28.069
you'll take inspiration
in whatever form it comes.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.569
Oh, and all that
delicious description

39:30.602 --> 39:33.002
about what he sees
along the way,

39:33.038 --> 39:34.808
from a man.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.070
- You mean the drover?

39:36.107 --> 39:37.807
- You.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.853
- I don't know.

39:39.878 --> 39:43.148
God, I haven't thought
about that in a long time.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.724
- Where did that come from?

39:47.753 --> 39:49.763
- God only knows.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.158
- From high in that ivory tower
of yours.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.560
- Give me a break.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.157
Damn.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.626
You aced me.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.525
- Of course I did.

40:01.567 --> 40:02.867
- Do you care for tuna melts?

40:02.901 --> 40:04.071
- I've never had one.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.842
- Oh, then it's settled.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.608
- Groundbreaking.

40:14.946 --> 40:22.886
*

40:38.169 --> 40:39.199
- Hi.

40:39.237 --> 40:42.737
- Hey.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.714
You went late.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.783
- Yeah, I did.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.584
What are you looking at?

40:51.617 --> 40:53.887
- My roots.

40:53.919 --> 40:57.559
- That's good.

40:57.589 --> 40:58.859
I called you today.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.933
- Well, I never heard it ring.

41:10.035 --> 41:13.665
- Did you see this?

41:13.705 --> 41:14.635
- Nope.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.947
- Andy Koch won the Hugo.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.551
- Goddamn it!

41:25.584 --> 41:27.524
Oh, he's a fucking slime.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.986
He ruined Bluebird.

41:36.728 --> 41:37.928
- You never said that before.

41:37.963 --> 41:41.233
- I'm saying it now.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.896
- Look, Sam, there's probably

41:42.934 --> 41:44.774
a more constructive way
you could look at this.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.613
- Please.
What am I, one of your kids?

41:47.639 --> 41:49.609
- You know what?
Forget about it, okay?

41:49.641 --> 41:51.211
I'm just trying to help.

42:03.822 --> 42:11.762
*

42:18.937 --> 42:21.837
- Hey, um...

42:21.873 --> 42:23.943
I'm really sorry.

42:23.975 --> 42:27.205
It's my problem.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.305
I get that.

42:29.347 --> 42:31.747
*

42:31.783 --> 42:33.753
Mary?

42:33.785 --> 42:41.725
*

43:27.673 --> 43:35.613
*

44:22.794 --> 44:23.834
- Come here.

44:32.470 --> 44:35.470
- That's the one I used to love,
that skirt.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.006
First time we went out.

44:38.043 --> 44:39.443
- Tell me more.

44:46.151 --> 44:54.231
- Weren't we supposed to talk?

45:04.102 --> 45:06.002
- What was that?
- You said you wanted it crazy.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.967
Oh, Sam.

45:08.006 --> 45:09.776
- Oh, shit.

45:11.476 --> 45:14.476
- Me too.

45:14.512 --> 45:17.882
Where'd you learn that?
- TV.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.416
*

45:19.450 --> 45:27.430
- Oh, my God, Sam.

45:35.533 --> 45:37.003
- Hello.

45:37.035 --> 45:38.895
- I finally read it.

45:38.937 --> 45:39.907
- What?

45:39.938 --> 45:42.368
- Jack's email!

45:42.407 --> 45:44.007
- You never looked at it?

45:44.042 --> 45:46.542
- 'Cause I knew.
Of course I knew.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.847
He wants me to visit.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.350
- Oh.

45:50.381 --> 45:51.481
Then maybe you should.

45:51.516 --> 45:53.946
- What?
- You said it yourself.

45:53.985 --> 45:57.985
You're holding on.
Maybe this'll help.

45:58.023 --> 46:00.133
- Let's go for it.
- Me?

46:00.158 --> 46:03.088
- Sammy, if I don't go now,
I never will.

46:20.511 --> 46:22.581
- It does this sometimes.
- We're already late.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.823
- Let's take yours.
- I don't own one.

46:24.850 --> 46:26.080
- The Mustang?
- No, that's Paul's.

46:26.117 --> 46:27.847
I can't touch it.
- Oh.

46:27.886 --> 46:28.986
You really are the housewife.

46:29.020 --> 46:32.090
- Oh, screw you.

46:32.123 --> 46:33.793
- Plan B.

46:45.536 --> 46:46.906
- Morning.

46:48.206 --> 46:51.036
- Oh, hi.

46:57.082 --> 47:05.022
*

47:18.636 --> 47:21.066
- It's right over there.

47:21.106 --> 47:22.306
Upstairs.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.580
- What do you need,
about an hour?

47:24.609 --> 47:26.339
- How long does it take?

47:32.918 --> 47:35.318
- So, Sam.

47:35.353 --> 47:38.663
- Yeah.
- What goes through your head?

47:38.689 --> 47:40.489
- When?

47:40.525 --> 47:42.355
- When you watch me.

47:42.393 --> 47:44.633
- Come on.

47:44.662 --> 47:46.432
*

47:46.464 --> 47:48.074
It just happened once.

47:51.036 --> 47:53.436
- Do you touch yourself?

47:53.471 --> 47:56.441
- What?
- Masturbate.

47:56.474 --> 47:58.014
- No.

47:58.043 --> 48:00.183
- Why not?
- It's against my religion.

48:03.514 --> 48:07.094
Haven't you ever wanted to have
a fully open conversation

48:07.118 --> 48:09.118
with a member
of the opposite sex?

48:09.154 --> 48:12.194
No agenda?
- Maybe.

48:12.223 --> 48:14.333
But I never thought about it
enough to want to pursue it.

48:14.359 --> 48:16.959
- Oh, come on.

48:16.995 --> 48:19.095
Now is your chance.

48:19.130 --> 48:22.270
*

48:22.300 --> 48:24.400
So?

48:38.449 --> 48:43.149
- Okay, sometimes I do...

48:43.188 --> 48:45.358
later.

48:45.390 --> 48:48.360
- What?

48:48.393 --> 48:51.103
- What you asked.

48:51.129 --> 48:53.299
- Oh.

48:53.331 --> 48:55.471
What do you think about?

48:55.500 --> 48:59.970
- I think about a lot
of different things, you know.

49:00.005 --> 49:03.405
- And when you're having sex?

49:06.177 --> 49:09.277
- Okay, like, sometimes...

49:09.314 --> 49:11.984
well, I'll think about burgers.

49:12.017 --> 49:14.087
- Hamburgers?

49:14.119 --> 49:15.349
- Yes.

49:16.687 --> 49:18.717
- When I'm getting
a little too,

49:18.756 --> 49:21.626
you know, excited,

49:21.659 --> 49:23.529
and I don't want to...

49:23.561 --> 49:25.131
- Go on.

49:25.163 --> 49:26.503
- Well, it's like they're
on the grill,

49:26.531 --> 49:28.031
you know,
and they're grass-fed.

49:28.066 --> 49:29.226
There's not much fat,
so you only need

49:29.267 --> 49:30.367
about two or three minutes
a side,

49:30.401 --> 49:33.071
and then you flip them over.

49:33.104 --> 49:35.714
- And if you're losing it?

49:35.740 --> 49:38.040
Yeah.

49:38.076 --> 49:41.676
- Well, then,
I think about something...

49:41.712 --> 49:45.022
- Sweet and sexy?

49:45.050 --> 49:48.150
- Yes.

49:48.186 --> 49:50.416
- Like...me?

49:52.690 --> 49:55.590
- No, the thought
never entered my mind.

49:55.626 --> 49:59.296
- Oh, please.
I know what you think.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.800
I can see it in your eyes.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.402
- You can?

50:03.434 --> 50:06.604
- You are totally busted.

50:06.637 --> 50:09.367
- Okay, fine.

50:09.407 --> 50:12.107
Then I don't have
to lie about it.

50:12.143 --> 50:14.353
- I'm down with that.

50:16.647 --> 50:17.817
- You are.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.218
- You're a man.

50:19.250 --> 50:21.320
I'm a woman.

50:21.352 --> 50:24.022
It doesn't mean
that we're doing anything.

50:26.391 --> 50:28.591
- Mm-hmm.

50:28.626 --> 50:31.256
- This is awesome.

50:31.296 --> 50:34.166
- This?
- Conversation.

50:34.199 --> 50:36.129
- It is.

50:36.167 --> 50:37.697
It's kind of good.
- Mm-hmm.

50:37.735 --> 50:40.135
- Liberating.
- Yeah.

50:44.209 --> 50:46.679
Because I wonder,

50:46.711 --> 50:49.551
sometimes guys,
they just turn off,

50:49.580 --> 50:52.250
you know, for no reason.

50:52.283 --> 50:56.453
So what's it like for you,

50:56.487 --> 50:59.757
getting older?

50:59.790 --> 51:01.530
- What?

51:01.559 --> 51:04.759
- I mean, is--
is it really the same?

51:10.168 --> 51:13.468
- Yeah.

51:13.504 --> 51:15.114
I'm gonna wait outside.

51:23.414 --> 51:31.364
*

51:45.870 --> 51:53.810
*

52:12.897 --> 52:14.327
- Thanks.

52:14.365 --> 52:15.895
- Mm-hmm.

52:26.977 --> 52:30.647
Do you ever just
want to have a conversation?

52:30.681 --> 52:33.851
With no agenda.

52:33.884 --> 52:35.694
- You have questions?

52:35.720 --> 52:38.390
- I don't know.
Do you?

52:38.423 --> 52:39.623
- Do you have a week?

52:44.595 --> 52:46.495
So you do.

52:46.531 --> 52:49.731
- Well...

52:49.767 --> 52:51.897
What's it like for you
to notice less attention

52:51.936 --> 52:53.666
as the years go by?

52:58.243 --> 52:59.483
- You don't think
I'm attractive?

52:59.510 --> 53:00.710
- Sure I do.

53:00.745 --> 53:03.345
- Oh, God,
you think I'm old?

53:03.381 --> 53:04.821
- Of course not.

53:04.849 --> 53:06.219
I think you're beautiful.

53:06.251 --> 53:07.291
- Oh, come on, Sam.

53:07.318 --> 53:08.748
You don't have to say that.

53:08.786 --> 53:12.316
- I'm not just saying that.

53:12.357 --> 53:14.987
So, what, is that
what this is about, huh?

53:15.025 --> 53:17.655
- Yeah, people
treat me differently.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.895
- People?

53:19.930 --> 53:21.800
- Yeah.

53:21.832 --> 53:23.872
- Oh, you mean women.

53:23.901 --> 53:26.241
- People.

53:26.271 --> 53:27.911
- How does that make you feel?

53:27.938 --> 53:30.308
- Come on, you know
how it makes me feel.

53:30.341 --> 53:32.611
I'm just seeing it,
you know?

53:32.643 --> 53:34.913
Time's marching on
for all of us.

53:34.945 --> 53:37.005
- Of course it marches on.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.647
I just try not to dwell on it.

53:38.683 --> 53:40.593
- But we need to.

53:40.618 --> 53:44.418
I mean, don't you ever want to
just stop and smell the roses?

53:47.558 --> 53:49.488
- Roses?
What?

53:50.895 --> 53:52.425
Oh.

53:52.463 --> 53:54.673
You mean young tender buds,
huh, like her.

53:54.699 --> 53:57.029
- No, that's not my point
at all.

53:57.067 --> 53:58.937
I want to wake up!

54:08.379 --> 54:11.549
- Are you angry with me?

54:11.582 --> 54:13.282
- How?
- I don't know.

54:13.318 --> 54:15.448
Is this some sort
of male/female thing

54:15.486 --> 54:16.886
because I make more money
than you?

54:16.921 --> 54:20.561
- I'm making no money!

54:20.591 --> 54:22.561
- Forget it.
I don't want to go there.

54:22.593 --> 54:24.903
- And I'm grateful.
- For what?

54:24.929 --> 54:26.729
- For you supporting me.

54:26.764 --> 54:29.304
- Look, in the beginning,
that's what it was.

54:29.334 --> 54:30.904
We needed the money.

54:30.935 --> 54:33.935
I actually like my work.

54:33.971 --> 54:35.871
In the room,

54:35.906 --> 54:37.406
I feel connected to people.

54:37.442 --> 54:40.082
It's...

54:41.379 --> 54:42.579
It's very intimate.

54:45.516 --> 54:49.786
- And that's
what you don't get here?

54:49.820 --> 54:51.460
- That's a good question.

54:58.963 --> 55:00.773
I'm not old.

55:28.025 --> 55:31.755
Crap.

55:35.032 --> 55:42.972
*

56:05.730 --> 56:13.670
*

56:24.181 --> 56:32.861
*

56:36.994 --> 56:40.674
*

56:40.698 --> 56:43.028
- Oh, Sammy.

56:50.207 --> 56:52.607
- Are we playing?

56:52.643 --> 56:55.183
- Don't you need to create?

56:55.212 --> 56:57.112
- I'm six months late.

56:57.147 --> 56:58.677
What's another day?

57:01.986 --> 57:04.116
- I told Paul.

57:05.990 --> 57:08.530
Four years ago,

57:08.559 --> 57:10.729
I had gone in
for a checkup,

57:10.761 --> 57:14.701
and, lo and behold...

57:17.902 --> 57:20.442
It turned out I was positive.

57:23.608 --> 57:27.008
But I couldn't believe it,
you know?

57:27.044 --> 57:29.984
How did it happen?
I had been careful.

57:32.650 --> 57:34.990
And when I asked him,

57:35.019 --> 57:37.089
Jack denied everything.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.661
No, sir, not him.

57:39.690 --> 57:43.530
- He lied?

57:43.561 --> 57:46.101
- I didn't think so.

57:46.130 --> 57:49.530
But three days later,
he broke up with me.

57:49.567 --> 57:50.937
Zip.

57:52.803 --> 57:54.173
- And the email?

57:54.204 --> 57:56.614
- He wanted to come clean.

57:59.910 --> 58:01.850
- So...

58:01.879 --> 58:04.519
now you're done with it?

58:07.552 --> 58:09.552
- Sammy, I have to be.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.930
- So how are you?

58:21.566 --> 58:26.036
- Well, okay, I guess.

58:26.070 --> 58:27.740
In a way, I'm fine.

58:32.309 --> 58:34.909
- I am so sorry, Jeff.

58:34.945 --> 58:37.045
I had no idea.

58:39.984 --> 58:43.024
And Paul?

58:43.053 --> 58:44.293
- He's good.

58:44.321 --> 58:46.991
That's the problem.

58:47.024 --> 58:48.634
- That's a problem?

58:48.659 --> 58:50.999
- It's that I'm not.

58:51.028 --> 58:52.128
- I have it;
he doesn't.

58:52.162 --> 58:54.162
It's a bitch, you know?

58:54.198 --> 58:58.238
And what's he got
to look forward to?

58:58.268 --> 59:01.238
- But he knew, right?

59:01.271 --> 59:03.671
- From the absolute beginning.

59:07.612 --> 59:09.612
- So maybe he loves you.

59:14.852 --> 59:18.622
The little I get,
it feels very deep.

59:23.994 --> 59:27.004
- That's it, isn't it?

59:27.031 --> 59:29.131
Love.

59:29.166 --> 59:32.936
That's what you write about.

59:35.973 --> 59:39.883
*

59:56.293 --> 01:00:00.303
- I have a theory.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.330
It's a zero-sum game.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.244
- Love?

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:09.140
- For every joy,
there's a sorrow.

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:13.143
You and Jack connect,
but that's pain for Paul.

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:16.677
You and Paul
bring sadness to Jack.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.924
On the one hand, there's joy.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.849
On the other,

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:22.685
not so much joy.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.290
In the end,
everything's equal.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:31.398
- You're such a loser.

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:33.298
- Why?

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:37.840
- Well, if that's all it is,
we should all slit our wrists.

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:42.008
No, what you're offering
is only part of it.

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:45.209
You're leaving out
the inspired act,

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:47.082
you know,
the impassioned leap forward,

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:50.451
the preemptive strike
of the samurai.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.420
Granted, it's a shaky progress,

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:55.689
but progress nonetheless.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.220
- How do you know?

01:00:57.254 --> 01:00:59.964
- Because I, too,
have a theory.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:04.085
- One step forward,
a half step back,

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:06.758
but definite movement.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:11.237
Like Jack sends an email,
you propose to Mary.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.138
- You knock on my door.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.010
- Exactly.

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:17.979
That's love too.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.878
- Maybe you're right.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:24.376
I hope you are.

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:30.757
*

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.458
- I think I saw him

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:36.429
on the river.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.960
- You did?

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:42.095
- He's homeless,
and his name is James.

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:43.432
He's got a new name now.

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:46.097
- James.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:50.166
And he's very surprised
to be there.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.837
- He doesn't know
why he's there?

01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:53.136
- No, he knows why,

01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:57.207
but he has this kind of
wake-up moment.

01:01:57.247 --> 01:02:01.987
*

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:17.232
- Sam?

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:39.355
*

01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:20.832
*

01:03:26.203 --> 01:03:28.073
Oh, God.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:40.054
- Hello?

01:03:40.084 --> 01:03:43.054
Honey Bear?

01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:45.587
- Hey, it's me.

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:47.262
- Hey.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.261
- How's it going?

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:50.963
- Pretty good.

01:03:50.995 --> 01:03:53.325
- Yeah, what are you doing?

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:57.473
- Working away.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.341
- How's Howie?

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:00.339
- James.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.310
He's James now.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.309
- James?

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.511
- Yeah, he's changed.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:08.413
- Why?

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:11.475
- Well, he was stuck.

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.515
- Stuck how?

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:14.620
- Mute.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:17.351
Immobile.

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:19.187
- Is he stuck now?

01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:21.463
- He feels unfettered.

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.991
- Well, that's no surprise.

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:25.628
- What do you mean?

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:30.132
- Yeah, because I'm actually
home right now.

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:31.397
- You're home?

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:34.095
- I'm standing in the house,
Sam.

01:04:34.138 --> 01:04:35.468
You know,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:39.375
but you and James
are remarkably absent.

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:42.579
Where are you?

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.653
- I'm next door.

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:52.394
*

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.362
Mary? Mary!

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:58.062
Aw, Mary, come on.
Come on.

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:00.325
*

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:10.235
*

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:15.546
*

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:26.522
*

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:59.621
*

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:36.227
Are you tipsy?

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:38.200
- Not nearly enough.

01:06:40.264 --> 01:06:41.574
- What about the car?

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:43.598
- Sherrie drove.

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:46.203
We talked...

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:48.106
a lot.

01:06:50.074 --> 01:06:51.684
- Great.

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:30.284
- So why do you lie?

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:33.451
- You mean today?

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:36.493
- Yeah, you want to start
with Sherman Oaks?

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.290
- That's easy.

01:07:40.324 --> 01:07:44.764
Jeff really needed to see Jack.

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:47.104
- And you?

01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:49.601
- Well, he needed support.

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:50.733
He's my friend.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:52.767
- Your new friend.

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:54.542
So you couldn't just tell me?

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.371
You know, you couldn't just say,
"Honey,

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.606
"I need to go to Sherman Oaks

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:00.342
"'cause Jeff, my new friend,

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:02.447
"needs to have closure
with his lover,

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:04.249
and he wants me
to hold his hand"?

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:06.321
"Oh, and, by the way,
we're gonna pick up Sherrie

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:09.290
so she and I can talk
about fucking all afternoon."

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:11.719
- Well, you see
why I couldn't say anything?

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:13.855
I mean, Jesus, that sounds bad.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:16.490
- It is bad.
- Look, Mary.

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:19.856
You know, I'm supposed to be
doing this--this thing,

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.595
working, being successful.

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:23.201
- Says who?

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:24.473
- Me!

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.901
And you and the situation,
you know?

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.305
There's a lot of pressure.
- How?

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:30.908
- You're calling all the time,

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.310
and Warren's calling,

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.712
so I turned off the phone.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:36.153
- But I call to encourage you.

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:39.319
- And you have expectations.

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:44.148
- Okay.

01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:45.558
Fine, I do.

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.219
But, Jesus,

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.187
you could be
a little bit more forthcoming.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.456
- I am trying to be,

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:52.455
but what can I tell you?

01:08:52.496 --> 01:08:54.526
I'm--I'm a guy!

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:56.634
- Jeff's a guy!

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:59.166
You talk to Jeff.

01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:00.943
Jesus, what is he,
your muse?

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.640
- No, but I got to tell you,

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:06.381
it's amazing, because we really
talk quite a bit.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.180
- Wow.

01:09:10.413 --> 01:09:13.654
Thanks a lot.

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:15.493
Anyway, that's...

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:16.919
That's what worries me,

01:09:16.953 --> 01:09:18.563
'cause you know
where talking gets you, huh?

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:19.818
Look where it got us.

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.756
- Oh, come on.

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.461
I'm not gonna fuck Jeff.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:26.303
I am really not interested.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.421
*

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:51.317
*

01:09:54.358 --> 01:10:01.968
*

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.843
*

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:07.339
I am an asshole.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.640
- Did you get my message?

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:16.945
*

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.780
- Can you just...

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:21.346
show me the room?

01:10:21.385 --> 01:10:23.745
*

01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:25.787
Just do it.

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:28.332
Walk to the bed.

01:10:28.358 --> 01:10:30.028
- Okay.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:36.969
*

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.440
Is that okay?

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:42.268
*

01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:45.806
- I just wanted to see it
one last time.

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:55.492
*

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:10.699
*

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:20.414
- Hey, you okay?

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:22.484
You want to talk about it?

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:27.852
*

01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:30.424
Is there something I can do,
anything I can do,

01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:31.894
to make it up to you?

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.691
- Yeah, you can stop lusting
after the neighbors.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.326
I'm serious, Sam.
I don't get it.

01:11:38.362 --> 01:11:39.832
You're all over the place,
you know?

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:42.033
What is this,
some sort of midlife crisis?

01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:44.495
- Midlife crisis,
that hurts.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:46.504
- Well, it's real.

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:49.566
- Well,
she does put it out there.

01:11:49.606 --> 01:11:51.536
- Who?

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:54.535
- Your pal, Sherrie.

01:11:54.578 --> 01:11:56.378
- What are you talking about?

01:11:56.413 --> 01:11:57.583
- In the backyard.

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.984
Au naturel.

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:03.845
- You stalk her?

01:12:03.887 --> 01:12:06.957
- You know,
it would be impossible not to.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.660
- What, like over the fence?

01:12:08.692 --> 01:12:10.132
- The window.

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:14.358
And not an ounce of fat.

01:12:14.398 --> 01:12:22.338
*

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:28.781
- There is actually something
you can do for me.

01:12:28.812 --> 01:12:30.812
I left my book bag in the car.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:34.847
*

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.760
*

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:41.790
Keys?

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:42.825
- It's unlocked.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:50.799
*

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.853
*

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.052
- What are you doing?

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:15.764
*

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:17.832
Damn it.

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:19.531
Hey.

01:13:19.563 --> 01:13:22.103
Hey, you can't do this.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:26.641
- You just earned
a big time-out.

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:28.610
- An almost naked time-out?

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:30.008
I don't think so.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:34.710
Mary.

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:40.822
- Sammy.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.560
Are you okay?

01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:49.960
- She locked me out.

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:52.233
- Well, aren't you freezing?

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.971
- I really haven't had a second
to think about it.

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:57.629
- Well, come inside.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.167
- No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:01.002
- Oh, come on.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.110
- Well.

01:14:17.921 --> 01:14:19.891
- What?

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:25.904
- Thank you.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:31.698
*

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:36.610
- So...

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.740
to what do we owe
the pleasure?

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:41.945
*

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:44.248
- She threw me out.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.650
- Domestic dispute?

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.754
- You could say that.

01:14:49.786 --> 01:14:50.946
- Over?

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:53.857
*

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:56.230
- She's confused.

01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:57.689
- Yeah?

01:14:57.727 --> 01:14:59.727
*

01:14:59.763 --> 01:15:02.803
- Uh, well, we've been spending
some time together.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.232
- We?

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:08.267
- He and I and Sherrie,
you know, from the back.

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:10.114
*

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:13.279
- I understand you escorted
Jeffrey to the Valley.

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:15.749
- Yeah.

01:15:15.779 --> 01:15:18.719
- To see an old partner.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:21.988
- We did.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:25.018
- You wouldn't consider that
a big fuck-you to me?

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:27.694
- He really needed to--
you know, and I thought--

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:29.994
No, wait a minute.
It wasn't against you.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:32.756
- Are you getting some
with Jeffrey?

01:15:32.796 --> 01:15:34.196
- Of course not.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.970
- With the new hottie?

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.899
- Well, that's none
of your business, is it?

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:41.714
*

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:43.708
- Stand up.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:44.840
- What?

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:45.884
- Up.

01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:47.909
*

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:49.684
Up.

01:15:49.713 --> 01:15:56.223
*

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.292
Turn around.

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:09.698
*

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:26.954
- Okay, what's so funny?

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:29.023
- You're not his type.

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:31.022
- Obviously.

01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:32.394
- I mean--no, I mean,
I'm not his type,

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:35.391
but you...

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.934
I hope I have half your game
when I'm your age.

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:50.174
- Was that a compliment?

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:53.136
- I believe that it was.

01:16:53.176 --> 01:16:54.836
- That's pretty confusing.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.920
- You want to talk?

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:08.024
- Do we have to talk now?

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.827
- No, Sammy, we don't.

01:17:09.859 --> 01:17:14.129
It's been a very long day.

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:16.133
Can I get you some clothes?

01:17:25.408 --> 01:17:32.778
*

01:17:35.819 --> 01:17:38.919
*

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:58.982
*

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:13.922
*

01:18:33.242 --> 01:18:36.112
- Is he gonna survive?

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:38.875
- I think.

01:18:38.915 --> 01:18:41.845
- He seems...

01:18:41.885 --> 01:18:45.285
defeated.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:48.261
- Depressed.

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:52.401
- Why depressed?

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:54.158
- He's an artist.

01:19:10.013 --> 01:19:12.053
- Corey Heinz
is looking for an intern.

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:16.293
- At the Contemporary?

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:19.159
- It's minimum wage.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:21.018
- I don't care.

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:23.527
Oh, my God, should I call him?

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:25.829
- I threw your name in the hat.

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:28.062
- You did?

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:30.527
When?

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:32.936
- This morning.

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:55.386
- Shh.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.064
Shh.

01:19:57.093 --> 01:19:58.463
- Okay.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:11.941
- Peeping Tom.

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:16.075
- What the hell?

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:18.482
For real?

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:21.954
- You could have just knocked.

01:20:21.985 --> 01:20:24.415
- I know. I'm sorry.
I just...

01:20:26.222 --> 01:20:30.192
I wanted you to come home.

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:33.256
- Because you--
- Because we're married.

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:35.526
Or maybe that's
no big deal to you.

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:38.204
- Of course it is.
I asked.

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:39.574
You accepted.

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:41.402
We had a ceremony.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.237
- All right, so could you please
just come home

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:46.942
and value it
with some integrity?

01:20:46.976 --> 01:20:48.336
- What are you talking about?

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:50.947
I do, every day.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:53.180
- You do?
What does that look like?

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:02.063
- What do you mean?

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:06.631
- I mean honesty and openness,
no matter what.

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:09.132
- I try!

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:11.425
I do,
but every time, we just--

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:21.507
I have no idea what I could say

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:25.184
that's gonna make any difference
in this situation.

01:21:28.952 --> 01:21:32.192
- That is so you to give up.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.261
You know, just when you're
on the brink of something,

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:37.590
you just give up.

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:40.326
So guess what.
Now it's my turn.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.336
I'm sorry.

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:52.512
*

01:21:54.410 --> 01:22:02.350
*

01:22:21.304 --> 01:22:23.544
- She's right.

01:22:23.572 --> 01:22:26.712
I let her down...

01:22:26.742 --> 01:22:29.682
in so many ways.

01:22:29.712 --> 01:22:33.082
- You have to tell her...

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:36.386
what's going on
in the ivory tower.

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:40.159
- There's nothing going on.

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:42.289
- Is that the truth?

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:49.766
- In a way, you know...

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.998
there's a lot going on.

01:22:52.035 --> 01:22:53.635
- Yes.

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:57.069
- Like even here, you and I,

01:22:57.106 --> 01:22:59.776
the things that we talk about,

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:02.148
they're like...

01:23:02.178 --> 01:23:03.578
They're parts of myself

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:09.022
that I've put aside
and literally forgotten.

01:23:09.052 --> 01:23:13.792
Like my passion, I mean,
where did that go?

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.422
- Did it walk out the door?

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:17.358
- No, I'm not putting that
on her.

01:23:17.393 --> 01:23:19.733
It's mine.

01:23:19.762 --> 01:23:21.232
It's me,

01:23:21.264 --> 01:23:22.674
and I lost it.

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:31.035
- Then maybe it's time
for the inspired act,

01:23:31.074 --> 01:23:35.114
the preemptive strike
of the samurai.

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:39.724
Take a stand for yourself

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:42.148
and what you want.

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:51.528
*

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.800
- I got to go.

01:23:53.829 --> 01:23:58.729
*

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:02.137
Thanks, Jeff.

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:21.389
*

01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:32.367
*

01:25:14.477 --> 01:25:21.547
- Hi.

01:25:25.388 --> 01:25:27.258
- Why are you here?

01:25:29.725 --> 01:25:32.925
I want to tell you
that I feel bad for lying to you

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:37.871
and taking advantage of you
and for not owning up,

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:40.470
and I'm doing my best,
right now,

01:25:40.503 --> 01:25:44.443
to just keep talking

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:50.883
and not disappear.

01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:54.753
- Do you want out?

01:25:54.783 --> 01:25:56.323
- Of--of what?

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:57.522
- Us.

01:25:57.553 --> 01:25:59.223
- No, not in the least.

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:00.755
- Are you sure?

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:04.659
- It's the one thing
I'm absolutely sure of.

01:26:04.693 --> 01:26:06.303
Do you?

01:26:06.329 --> 01:26:09.229
- I don't know.

01:26:09.265 --> 01:26:11.625
I really don't.

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.467
I know I don't want it
like this.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.602
- I can understand that.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.240
So why are you making
everything so miserable?

01:26:20.276 --> 01:26:24.876
- You know, it's been six years
since Bluebird,

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:28.383
and honestly
Bluebird was shit!

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:30.717
Each year,
it gets harder and harder.

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:35.323
I don't know if I have
what it takes, you know,

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:37.658
that thing, that shimmer,
you know?

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.733
I don't even know if what I have
to say is relevant any more.

01:26:40.763 --> 01:26:44.503
I mean, I used to be on fire.

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.243
Now I'm like a washed-up
stay-at-home.

01:26:46.269 --> 01:26:48.539
- What does that even mean?

01:26:48.571 --> 01:26:50.541
You used to be the guy
that said to me

01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:52.643
that if you could speak
to the heart of one person,

01:26:52.675 --> 01:26:55.705
it was worth it.

01:26:55.744 --> 01:26:58.554
That was Sam Tucker.

01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:01.521
*

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.350
What happened to that guy?

01:27:03.386 --> 01:27:06.856
*

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:08.989
- He got scared.

01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:11.264
- Of what?

01:27:11.294 --> 01:27:14.664
- Of everything.

01:27:14.697 --> 01:27:15.997
Of failing!

01:27:16.031 --> 01:27:17.471
Failing to provide,

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.570
failing to be vital,
compelling,

01:27:19.602 --> 01:27:23.812
failing to make you pregnant.

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:26.709
You know, it's easy to be cocky
when you're 20,

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:28.842
but I don't feel that way
anymore.

01:27:28.877 --> 01:27:31.447
- Well, who does?

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:34.750
Jesus, you're in
the shit-or-shut-up years.

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:43.533
*

01:27:43.559 --> 01:27:45.429
So what do you see?

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:55.336
- I create exactly what I fear.

01:27:55.371 --> 01:27:57.671
- Yeah, I can see that.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.010
- What do you see?

01:28:13.088 --> 01:28:16.058
- I'm disappointed.

01:28:18.494 --> 01:28:20.904
I'm really disappointed.

01:28:23.599 --> 01:28:25.469
I mean, I could dig in at work
and be happy.

01:28:25.501 --> 01:28:27.701
I could.

01:28:27.736 --> 01:28:32.066
But I don't want that.

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:35.477
I want it at home with you,

01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:37.881
you know, with us.

01:28:47.456 --> 01:28:51.556
*

01:28:54.597 --> 01:29:02.537
*

01:29:41.444 --> 01:29:49.384
*

01:30:19.715 --> 01:30:27.655
*

01:30:45.674 --> 01:30:48.084
- I guess I've been asleep
for most of my life.

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:53.676
And waking up
doesn't happen all at once.

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:59.994
It's a hell of a fight
back to the surface,

01:31:00.022 --> 01:31:02.532
and nothing is certain.

01:31:02.558 --> 01:31:05.158
You might not make it.

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:06.963
- Tucker, regular?

01:31:06.995 --> 01:31:08.025
- Hey, wait a minute.

01:31:08.063 --> 01:31:10.233
You got a orange Creamsicle?

01:31:10.265 --> 01:31:11.665
- Yeah.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.900
- It takes, well,

01:31:13.936 --> 01:31:18.506
okay, love mostly.

01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:20.081
Yeah, that.

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:24.850
I guess that is what
I write about,

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.010
when I write.

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:33.217
You never know
from where it will come...

01:31:34.723 --> 01:31:38.233
- Or where it will land.

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:41.960
Across an entire continent?

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:45.827
Across the river?

01:31:45.868 --> 01:31:47.598
Across the fence?

01:31:51.574 --> 01:31:55.814
So let it in.

01:31:55.844 --> 01:31:58.784
- Let it go.

01:31:58.814 --> 01:32:00.554
Don't disappear.

01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:02.323
*

01:32:03.886 --> 01:32:11.826
*

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:27.307
*

01:32:39.254 --> 01:32:44.234
- * There comes a day

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:48.899
* Without warning

01:32:48.931 --> 01:32:51.001
*

01:32:51.033 --> 01:32:55.343
* And it keeps on slowing

01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:57.110
* Like the river

01:32:57.139 --> 01:33:05.079
*

01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:17.628
* I walked away

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:24.200
* Without knowing

01:33:24.232 --> 01:33:30.242
* And I keep on going

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:32.142
*

01:33:32.174 --> 01:33:35.414
* Like a blind sheep

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:44.893
*

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.890
* So strange

01:33:47.923 --> 01:33:50.363
* So unruly

01:33:50.392 --> 01:33:52.392
* So close

01:33:52.427 --> 01:33:56.027
* So familiar

01:33:56.064 --> 01:34:04.244
*

01:34:04.272 --> 01:34:09.142
* There comes a day

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:15.817
* In the storming

01:34:15.851 --> 01:34:22.221
* For the banks overflowing

01:34:22.257 --> 01:34:23.827
*

01:34:23.859 --> 01:34:27.759
* Taking down the stone

01:34:27.796 --> 01:34:31.826
* Oh, without warning

01:34:31.867 --> 01:34:39.807
*

01:34:42.044 --> 01:34:44.254
* Oh

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:55.956

01:35:06.835 --> 01:35:09.295
* So strange

01:35:09.337 --> 01:35:11.937
* So unruly

01:35:11.974 --> 01:35:14.144
* So close

01:35:14.176 --> 01:35:16.376
* So familiar

01:35:16.411 --> 01:35:21.481
- * Ahh

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:26.246
*

01:35:26.288 --> 01:35:32.898
* Ahh

01:35:32.928 --> 01:35:36.328

01:36:09.898 --> 01:36:13.098
* Ah, ah

01:36:13.135 --> 01:36:21.075
