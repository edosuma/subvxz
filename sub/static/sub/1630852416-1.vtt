WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:02.635
This is a family business.
the next logical leaders

00:02.769 --> 00:04.104
would be Amber and myself.

00:04.270 --> 00:06.439
Jesse and I are teaming
up on a new business venture.

00:06.606 --> 00:07.507
Bam!

00:07.607 --> 00:10.844
Me and VJ are also
strongly betrothed.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.545
Not a real family;
no kids.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.047
Slam, I like that one!

00:15.682 --> 00:17.550
A reporter
is in our backyard.

00:17.617 --> 00:18.952
You don't know
who you're messin' with.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.954
I'm on the way up,
and you on the way down.

00:22.455 --> 00:23.723
Let's go save
our family.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.243
Your pal says he takes a magic
pill that gives him

00:43.309 --> 00:45.178
an extra two inches off the tee,
and buddy,

00:45.211 --> 00:47.213
that's more suspect
than my hairline.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.549
Turns out she said "celibate"
and not "selling it",

00:49.582 --> 00:51.484
so you lost a couple teeth but
you got to keep your 20 bucks.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.820
You put that magic pill in with
your pal's vitamins

00:53.853 --> 00:55.722
and that isn't even the first
time he was rock hard

00:55.755 --> 00:57.424
at the Santa Claus Parade.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.692
Folks on the news can't keep
telling me how bad gaslighting

00:59.726 --> 01:01.394
is without showing me at least
one blue angel,

01:01.428 --> 01:02.662
like, I'll
be the judge there.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.364
You know two things
for damn sure,

01:04.397 --> 01:06.866
and that's life is a highway
and Twitter is a cult.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.568
You and your sweetie aren't
Facebook official anymore,

01:08.601 --> 01:10.737
because she says she wants a man
who will spoil her.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.338
Must've forgotten that hotel
room in Niagara Falls

01:12.372 --> 01:14.107
with a fucking heart-shaped
hot tub in it.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.376
Your steak came out just a wee
bit too well done,

01:16.409 --> 01:18.378
had you shaking the entire
fucking four-top

01:18.411 --> 01:20.113
trying to cut through
the cocksucker.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.514
Your gal decided to get her
first IUD

01:21.548 --> 01:23.416
after you got
your third DUI.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.019
Your pal got a piece of gum
stuck between his butt cheeks

01:26.052 --> 01:28.254
one time, and
isn't that curious?

01:28.288 --> 01:30.123
They say that sex sells,
but it must be sold out

01:30.190 --> 01:32.025
'cause I can't find
a lick of it on Kijiji.

01:32.058 --> 01:34.427
You stopped going to church,
'cause like,

01:34.461 --> 01:36.930
well it's just a wee bit too hot
in there, but...

01:36.963 --> 01:39.699
you can pray for a new Shania
Twain album from home.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.367
You got a pal that likes to air
his dirty laundry,

01:41.401 --> 01:42.902
and there's no telling how many
people heard him say

01:42.936 --> 01:44.604
he's got the clap, but they
didn't need to shut down

01:44.637 --> 01:46.106
the water park
the whole fucking day.

01:46.139 --> 01:47.774
You heard people saying
the Dos Equis guy

01:47.807 --> 01:50.110
is supposed to be the most
interesting man on Earth,

01:50.143 --> 01:51.778
but most interesting woman for
sure goes

01:51.811 --> 01:55.048
to the Asian Zamboni driver who
just beat you at horseshoes

01:55.081 --> 01:57.050
and loves Insane Clown Posse.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.718
Bret the Hitman Hart is a
Canadian icon,

01:58.751 --> 02:00.553
so you had to put your little
cousint' in a sharp shooter

02:00.587 --> 02:02.088
for calling him
"Bret the Hitman Fart".

02:02.122 --> 02:04.390
There's a new dentist in town
that does teeth whitening,

02:04.424 --> 02:06.326
so now you've got the awkward
task of telling

02:06.392 --> 02:08.962
one or two pals their teeth
are yellow as duck feet.

02:08.995 --> 02:11.264
Your one buddy who ruins the
bathroom at every house party

02:11.297 --> 02:12.832
he's at is the same buddy that
looks down on you

02:12.899 --> 02:14.100
for pissing outside.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.569
You had your first prostate exam
the other day,

02:16.603 --> 02:18.138
which is no picnic, but even
that's better

02:18.171 --> 02:19.572
than being asked
if you're "pissy".

02:19.606 --> 02:21.441
Your friend Sean Amsing still
ain't getting the glory

02:21.474 --> 02:23.076
he deserves for calling
his Halloween party

02:23.109 --> 02:24.744
Premature Ejacu-lantern.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.313
Gals who tuck their phones into
their bras on the dance floor

02:27.347 --> 02:29.315
cannot be knocked out.

02:29.349 --> 02:32.585
But gals who take their shoes
off on the dance floor

02:32.619 --> 02:33.753
will try.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.635
Previously on
Letterkenny...

02:48.668 --> 02:52.405
Connor. Darien.
Quick the banner.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.007
2cock Chakur?

02:54.040 --> 02:55.542
They just call
us 2cock.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.144
- Tassie.
- Cassie.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.546
- I'm Tassie.
- I'm Cassie.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.214
I'm sick of
these dudes already.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.650
It's like
the shotguns are cocks.

03:04.584 --> 03:07.754
- Let's go then.
- Let's do this.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.189
"NDN NRG"?

03:09.222 --> 03:11.891
Your logo looks just Bit & Bites
like the BROdude logo.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.159
No.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.427
Tastes the same too.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.862
Did you come to sue
the mukluks off me?

03:15.895 --> 03:19.532
How about I read some
Ancestry.com results instead?

03:19.566 --> 03:21.834
Your rez's rules state
that in order to play

03:21.868 --> 03:23.836
for the Native team,
you must be Native.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.738
Reilly, Jones and Shore,

03:25.772 --> 03:28.675
the DNA submitted for all three
of them was the same.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.777
The directions said to spit
in a cup and send it in.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.579
So we spit in the cup
like the directions said.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.081
- Who sent it in?
- Shoresy!

03:35.114 --> 03:36.382
Fucking PokÃ©mons,

03:36.416 --> 03:38.084
gotta catch 'em all,
you piece of shit.

03:38.117 --> 03:42.188
I must revoke the Kerry County
Eagles championship status.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.191
No!

03:45.225 --> 03:48.194
That cup belonged to
the Three River Lakers.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.196
Fucking Three Rivers.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.434
- Katy, I have a new boyfriend.
- Oh?

03:54.467 --> 03:56.202
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.104
'Kay.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.419
So, like, what would you say

04:13.453 --> 04:15.054
is the best donny
you've ever had, boys?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.890
- Like the best Donnie Wahlberg.
- Like, the best Donny Osmond.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.525
Like the best brook
you've ever donnied.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.127
Like the best Jungle Brook.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.562
When Dierks came back
to Letterkenny.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.198
- Boughts and paids fors.
- Heard about that.

04:25.231 --> 04:26.366
You are the king of sucker.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.201
That's high praise coming
from you, bud.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.069
Thinks we all gots in
a suckers on that ones.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.371
Oh, I got in a good sucker.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.472
But you are
the king of sucker.

04:32.538 --> 04:33.573
Fucking him or me.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.208
I'd sucker you in your sleep,
boys.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.043
Eat, sleep, sucker, boys.

04:37.076 --> 04:38.211
But you are the king of sucker.

04:38.244 --> 04:39.579
Put a fucking shirt on.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.381
- Well, how do you do it?
- Same way you do it.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.715
Well, you do it more
than I do it.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.651
Wanna just fuckin' whip our
dicks out here or...

04:44.717 --> 04:46.452
You never sucker a guy in
a one-on-one.

04:46.486 --> 04:47.787
That's dishonourable.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.622
Well, unless he previously
suckered me first, eh,

04:49.656 --> 04:50.890
you fuckin'
nut-tugger.

04:50.923 --> 04:52.558
In a one-on-one, you wanna
follow the steps.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.727
What, like square off, scrap.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.664
Well, square off,
scrap, shake hands.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.066
Square off,
scrap, maybe shake hands.

05:00.099 --> 05:03.236
Nah, square off, scrap, shake
hands, maybes haves a beers.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.837
Ideally you're having a beer.

05:04.904 --> 05:07.473
- Yeah that'd be most desirable.
- Y'know, in a perfect world.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.442
There's no perfect world in
a brawl though, boys.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.844
Yeah, hundy p, no rules
in a big donny-b, boys.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.246
No rules ever for the king
of sucker.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.414
You better settle
down over there

05:14.447 --> 05:15.915
or I'm gonna come talk to ya.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.751
Well, even numbers in a brawl
is technically one-on-one.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.454
- Fuck, look at you JB!
- What's next, long division?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.922
Fucking Roman
numerals over here.

05:22.955 --> 05:24.624
He'll be multiplying fractions
in no time.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.460
Hey, what's the co-efficient
of X, ya fuckin' walnut?

05:27.493 --> 05:29.429
King of suckers.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.997
Look, I'd already suckered
him once.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.965
Yeah, you suckered him a
while back there, good buddy.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.634
So, it's his own fault
he didn't learn

05:34.667 --> 05:35.935
from the first sucker.
- Fools me once.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.770
At a certain point it's his own
responsibility

05:37.804 --> 05:39.839
he got himself suckered again,
isn't it?

05:40.940 --> 05:43.443
Now, if you ever hit me and
I find out about it.

05:43.476 --> 05:45.178
Eat, sleep,
sucker, boys.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.783
What's this about
a sucker?

05:50.817 --> 05:55.154
Story time, Dickskin.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.390
Dickens.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.691
Everybody, out! Go!

05:58.725 --> 06:00.793
You too, get out. Quicker.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.562
What do you think this is,
a parade?

06:02.628 --> 06:03.796
Get out of my bar now!

06:03.830 --> 06:05.732
You too, get out of my bar!
Go right now!

06:05.798 --> 06:08.301
You in the curly hair...

06:08.334 --> 06:10.970
...All of you,
take your hat and go!

06:12.405 --> 06:13.706
Come on, come on, come on!

06:16.676 --> 06:19.145
- Buddy?
- Hey, buddy.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.080
- Think we got a problem, buddy.
- I know, buddy.

06:21.147 --> 06:22.749
Just lost a 'ship.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.650
No, I know, buddy, but I think
we might've--

06:24.684 --> 06:28.254
I think we might've lost Cassie
and Tassie too.

06:28.321 --> 06:32.058
Tassie!
- Cassie!

06:32.091 --> 06:33.826
Yeah, buddy, either we finally
called them

06:33.860 --> 06:35.895
by their right names,
or they're not here.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.230
- Let's fan out.
- Go north-south.

06:37.263 --> 06:38.331
Neutral zone trap?

06:38.364 --> 06:41.534
- Let's get it.
- Let's get it.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.835
- Tassie!
- Cassie!

06:42.869 --> 06:44.437
You sure about this, Auntie?

06:44.504 --> 06:46.172
Yeah...

06:46.205 --> 06:47.840
She looks pretty
shysty, Auntie.

06:47.874 --> 06:48.841
Yeah.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.576
She's pretty sexy though,
Auntie.

06:50.610 --> 06:54.414
Yeah.
Yeah. I'm sure about this.

06:54.447 --> 06:56.082
Eh!

06:56.115 --> 06:57.950
Let's talk.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.623
Pretty fuckin' cool.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.591
Dierks'd still be a fight
on-sight, eh, good buddy?

07:05.625 --> 07:07.860
No need.
Fuckin' douchebag.

07:07.894 --> 07:11.597
Wants currently outweighs
needs, Miss Katys.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.467
Hi, big cutes.

07:14.534 --> 07:17.770
You got big balls coming
back here.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.305
I got big everything
down there.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.041
Hence the nickname
"Long-Dick Dierks".

07:22.074 --> 07:24.277
You thinks anyone's
happy to see youse?

07:24.310 --> 07:26.212
Judging by your tone, no.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.215
Which is very concerning,
very concerning,

07:29.248 --> 07:30.650
very complexing.
- Then beat it.

07:30.716 --> 07:34.220
Rosie, Rosie, Rosie,
you and me, I would not...

07:34.253 --> 07:36.556
oppose ye.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.891
Hey, where's big Dad?

07:38.925 --> 07:40.293
Okay, his friends are
still cross.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.895
Very predictable, very
predictable, very prophesized.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.664
I told them they don't
need to.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.767
Wants is still outweighing
needs, Miss Katys.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.670
I'm not as dumb as you look,
my favourite of the guys,

07:50.736 --> 07:53.406
for your very,
very kind eyes.

07:53.439 --> 07:54.974
Long-Dick Dierks
comes prepared.

07:55.007 --> 07:59.812
Very prepared, very processed,
very primed.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.417
- You said it wouldn't get ugly.
- He says a lot of things.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.986
- She's right, baby boo.
- Oh, is she?

08:07.019 --> 08:10.156
If you want to date a bad boy,
you can't be upset

08:10.189 --> 08:12.892
when he does bad boy things.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.197
You remember my, uh,
cousint' I'm sure.

08:18.264 --> 08:21.434
Of course, Dierks,
I'm unforgettable.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.935
Appreciate the accompaniment,
Elmo.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.804
- Elmo?
- It's actually Elmo-Adrianus,

08:24.837 --> 08:27.607
two first names, hyphenated.
It's Dutch.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.775
- You look Dutch.
- We're all Dutch.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.711
This is
Aldert-Kristoffel,

08:31.777 --> 08:33.813
and Vas-Bram-Ambroos.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.815
Which is actually three
hyphenated first names.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.817
So, you all have two hyphenated
first names?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.151
Two to three, yeah.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.187
It's pretty common in our
area of Dutch Michigan.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.455
But just one last name.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.856
Last name is common only
hyphenated as well.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.858
- In Dutch Michigan.
- Yes.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.728
To carry on the legacies of
both the "moeder en vader".

08:48.794 --> 08:50.463
- What are your last names?
- We all have the same

08:50.496 --> 08:51.664
last name,
we're cousints'.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.367
- That being?
- Rensburg-van Koeverden.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.168
- Look at you.
- Enough talk.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.839
Let's go, right now. Ain't
doing what we did last time.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.874
And what-- what was that?

09:01.908 --> 09:03.476
- Oh-ho, you know.
- Don't thinks we do.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.478
- Oh, I know you do.
- Is it kick your ass?

09:05.511 --> 09:06.746
- The other thing!
- Eat?

09:06.812 --> 09:09.682
No, no, the thing we did between
those two things

09:09.715 --> 09:11.584
when you were-- eh, fuck!

09:11.651 --> 09:14.887
- Easy, easy.
- I'm alright.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.490
I'm not getting sucked into
your syrup-eatin' games again.

09:17.523 --> 09:18.758
- Really?
- Really, bro.

09:18.824 --> 09:20.860
Ain't here for that cute
back-and-forth bullshit

09:20.893 --> 09:22.895
you canucks
love so much, eh?

09:22.929 --> 09:24.063
- For real.
- The realist.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.665
- You sure?
- I'm positive, brah.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.199
Sounds like you've made up
your mind.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.601
Oh good, you can hear.

09:28.668 --> 09:29.735
Already kinda
doing it, though.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.003
Believe me,
bro, I'm not.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.705
Do you not realize it's
happenings right nows?

09:32.738 --> 09:34.774
Not in a million years, amigo,
not on my watch.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.375
What would you call what's
currently taking place?

09:36.409 --> 09:39.278
Some bacon-makers about to get
their butts beat. Yeah!

09:39.345 --> 09:40.546
What's your name again?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.516
Elmo-Adrianus Rensburg-
van Koeverden, bitch!

09:43.549 --> 09:45.518
- Who are you?
- Squirrely Dan.

09:45.551 --> 09:46.619
That's a stupid name.

09:46.686 --> 09:47.954
So you're saying you
don't wanna talk.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.590
- No talk, all action.
- And here we are talkings.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.391
- Uh, no we're not.
- But here we are though.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.528
- Nah. Not happenin', padre.
-.

09:55.561 --> 09:58.798
Hey, I'm the guy who tells you
what's happening right now,

09:58.864 --> 10:01.434
paisano.
- Right, talkin'.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.035
- Uh-uh.
- Then stop talking.

10:03.069 --> 10:07.373
No way, Jose. We're gonna keep--
no, wait, okay, fuck!

10:07.406 --> 10:09.742
- Lock it up.
- Yammer.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.479
All right, the talkin' ends now
and the fighting begins.

10:13.546 --> 10:17.049
Okay.
Just one more quick sec.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.884
For what?

10:20.453 --> 10:26.258
âª You better stop, yeah âª

10:26.292 --> 10:31.764
âª Dogging me around âª

10:36.902 --> 10:42.108
âª If you don't stop,
yeah âª

10:43.009 --> 10:47.780
âª I'm gonna put you down âª

10:52.585 --> 10:57.490
âª Cause, I can't take it âª

10:57.523 --> 11:00.159
âª Much longer âª

11:00.993 --> 11:03.996
âª My heart's
getting weak âª

11:04.997 --> 11:07.833
âª It's not getting
any stronger âª

11:08.968 --> 11:11.170
âª You keep me so upset âª

11:12.505 --> 11:14.840
âª My head's
in a whirl âª

11:17.143 --> 11:20.379
âª But if you wanna
be my girl âª

11:21.647 --> 11:26.619
âª You'd better stop, yeah âª

11:26.652 --> 11:31.857
âª Doggin' me around âª

11:37.296 --> 11:41.867
âª Cause if you don't stop,
yeah, âª

11:43.736 --> 11:48.307
âª I'm gonna put you down âª

11:53.179 --> 11:55.314
- Dirty sucker.
- That's redundant.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.651
As I recall, the story involved
two suckers from Wayne.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.219
Well, look at you,
can't count to two.

12:00.252 --> 12:03.989
- One, two, fuck you.
- Well, three, four...

12:04.023 --> 12:06.358
- Fuck you more?
- Put a fuckin' shirt on.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.027
You ought to take JB's math
class, Tyson.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.262
Hey, how high can you
counts, JBs?

12:10.329 --> 12:12.665
I'm too--
too high to count.

12:12.698 --> 12:14.166
JB, real quick,
five plus five.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.835
We're all these fellas
bigger than you?

12:15.868 --> 12:16.869
'Pert nears.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.037
Just painting a mental picture.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.405
Yeah, 'pert near mostly.

12:19.438 --> 12:21.340
'Pert near no one was bigger
than joint boy, though.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.676
Yeah, 'pert near only a few were
bigger than Tyson too.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.345
Any reservations about beating
on someone smaller than you?

12:26.378 --> 12:28.681
Well, if there was, how would
you ever be in a scrap?

12:28.714 --> 12:31.050
Yahtzee.

12:31.083 --> 12:35.054
âª You better stop, yeah âª

12:35.087 --> 12:40.226
âª Dogging me around âª

12:45.731 --> 12:49.068
âª If you don't stop,
I âª

12:51.103 --> 12:55.441
âª I'm gonna put you down âª

12:59.044 --> 13:03.115
âª Yes, put you down âª

13:05.151 --> 13:08.988
âª I don't wanna do it,
but I'll have to âª

13:09.054 --> 13:11.824
âª Put you down âª

13:11.891 --> 13:14.393
- King of the suckers.
- King of the suckers.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.096
That still wasn't the biggest
story of the night.

13:17.129 --> 13:21.066
Youse ever get that sorted?

13:21.100 --> 13:23.736
- They smoke-bombed us, buddy.
- Ninja dusted, bro.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.742
- Cassie.
- Tassie.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.577
- I'm Cassie.
- I'm Tassie.

13:31.610 --> 13:32.978
Give your balls a tug.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.814
Shoresy?

13:34.847 --> 13:37.917
You lost a 'ship and you stole
our sweeties?

13:37.950 --> 13:39.418
Your sweeties hopped
into my truck

13:39.451 --> 13:41.520
like a couple of homeless
derelicts jumping a train.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.622
I'm supposed to be honey-dicking
your moms right now,

13:43.656 --> 13:44.857
you fucking losers.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.493
What happened to Ancestry.com?
What did you do?

13:47.526 --> 13:50.095
A broad-ski I used to wheel in
Junior works there now.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.464
She told me your tests came
back white as snow,

13:52.498 --> 13:53.999
so I gave her my DNA.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.635
- So, you spit in our cups?
- No, I fucked her.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.337
Oh, that DNA.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.773
A Native I'm wheeling spit in
your cups.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.775
But-- Why?

14:02.808 --> 14:04.543
- You gotta get that W, boys.
- But...

14:04.610 --> 14:07.980
The glory of winning will never
equal the pain of losing.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.182
They don't ask how,
they ask how many?

14:10.216 --> 14:13.285
- But... but...
- But... but...

14:13.319 --> 14:14.453
No!

14:14.486 --> 14:16.555
- They do ask how!
- They did ask how.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.959
And they determined that we got
to how by cheating.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.493
And then, they took
away the how many!

14:21.527 --> 14:24.230
Where's your purse? You sound
like a fucking broad.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.131
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Reilly.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.033
Tell your mom to trim her
toenails,

14:28.067 --> 14:30.236
she carves up my thighs when
she gets buckin'.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.171
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Jonesy.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.006
Tell your mom to trim her
fingernails,

14:34.039 --> 14:36.809
Reilly's mom's getting
suspi.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.677
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Reilly.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.313
Your mom asked me to pull her
hair, and then hit me up

14:41.347 --> 14:43.082
for a hundo when her
extensions came out.

14:43.148 --> 14:45.184
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Jonesy.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.986
Your mum asked me to choke her
and seriously,

14:47.019 --> 14:48.520
not even that could
shut her up.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.522
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Reilly.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.425
Your mom wanted 11th hour anal
and lied when I asked

14:53.492 --> 14:56.028
if the chamber was empty. It's
one step forward, two steps

14:56.061 --> 14:58.564
back in this relationship.
I'm fuckin' sick of it.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.933
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Jonesy.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.202
Your mom says she's tense
with anxiety.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.336
Can you talk to her for me?

15:04.370 --> 15:06.205
She's gripping
my wiener way too hard.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.540
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Reilly.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.210
I walked in on your mum watchin'
porn and she tried to cover

15:11.243 --> 15:14.079
it up worse than she tried to
cover up your old man.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.282
- Fuck you, Shoresy.
- Fuck you, Jonesy.

15:16.348 --> 15:19.285
Your mom wanted to watch porn
and went straight for BDSM

15:19.351 --> 15:21.620
with complete disregard for
how triggering that is

15:21.687 --> 15:23.789
for anyone who's been
ball-gagged in their sleep

15:23.856 --> 15:25.057
by Reilly's mom.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.359
Fuck!
-

15:27.393 --> 15:29.962
So, yeah, it's back down
to one 'ship, boys.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.630
One 'ship's better than
no 'ship, buddy.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.532
Yeah, but two 'ships is better
than one 'ship, buddy.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.067
Wait, so...

15:35.100 --> 15:37.236
Oh, fuck here comes
algorithm face.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.371
Up next,
multi-variable calculus?

15:39.405 --> 15:42.107
Hey, let's hear some algebraic
geometry, you fuckin' ape.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.742
Up next reciprocities laws.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.478
Fuckin' dynamic systems and
differential equations.

15:46.545 --> 15:50.149
Fuckin' here we go now.
- I'.

15:50.215 --> 15:52.217
I feel like we keep getting
interrupted by you guys,

15:52.251 --> 15:54.453
and I don't really think that
we do that to you,

15:54.486 --> 15:56.789
so, I just want to know, why do
you keep doing it to us?

15:56.822 --> 15:58.590
- Onward.
- Daryl,

15:58.624 --> 16:01.961
to answer your question from
earlier, the answer is yes.

16:01.994 --> 16:03.495
We are currently head-down
and winning a 'ship

16:03.562 --> 16:05.264
in beer league hockey.
Thank you for asking.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.266
You should just call it beer
league though, buddy,

16:07.299 --> 16:09.835
I mean, it's so phoned in,
it's barely hockey.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.270
You're right.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.105
It is bad enough we call
Senior A Level shit hockey.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.108
Beer league is beer league,
it's its own gen-re.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.410
- Sorry?
- Gen-re.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.913
- Genre?
- It's its .

shelf-life on this.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.575

17:50.536 --> 17:52.671

17:52.704 --> 17:55.441
Guess you could stay I just
started fuckin' her real good.

17:56.775 --> 17:57.910
Yahtzee.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.212
