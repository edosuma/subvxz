00:18.185 --> 00:20.312
<i>Please, Luke.</i>
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:21.772
<i>How many cups</i>
<i>have you had this morning?</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:22.731
- <i>None.</i>
<i>- Plus?</i>

00:22.815 --> 00:24.024
<i>Five, but yours is better.</i>

00:24.107 --> 00:25.818
<i>I got a kissed.</i>
<i>And I shoplifted.</i>

00:25.901 --> 00:26.902
<i>Honestly, Lorelai,</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:28.904
<i>it's not your looks that keep them away.</i>
<i>Think about that.</i>

00:28.987 --> 00:32.115
<i>People die, we pay.</i>
<i>People crash cars, we pay.</i>

00:32.199 --> 00:33.325
<i>People lose a foot, we pay.</i>

00:33.408 --> 00:34.535
<i>At least you have</i>
<i>your new slogan.</i>

00:34.618 --> 00:36.662
- <i>Did you do something slutty?</i>
<i>- I'm not that happy.</i>

00:36.745 --> 00:38.038
<i>People are particularly stupid today.</i>

00:38.121 --> 00:39.957
- <i>Copper boom!</i>
<i>- Norman Mailer, I'm pregnant!</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:41.416
- <i>Luke can waltz?</i>
<i>- Luke can waltz.</i>

00:41.499 --> 00:43.251
<i>I just want you to know I'm in.</i>
<i>I am all in.</i>

00:43.335 --> 00:45.545
<i>It'd be like the first</i>
<i>15 minutes of</i> Saving Private Ryan,

00:45.629 --> 00:46.755
<i>but at least those guys</i>
<i>got to be in France.</i>

00:46.839 --> 00:49.466
<i>I am not going to Harvard.</i>
<i>I had sex, but I'm not going to Harvard!</i>

00:49.549 --> 00:51.719
<i>I stopped being a child</i>
<i>the minute the strip turned pink.</i>

00:51.802 --> 00:52.761
<i>You jump, I jump, Jack.</i>

00:52.845 --> 00:55.013
<i>Eternal damnation</i>
<i>is what I'm risking for my rock and roll.</i>

00:55.097 --> 00:56.098
<i>Oy with the poodles already.</i>

00:56.181 --> 00:58.350
<i>Because I love you, you idiot.</i>

00:58.433 --> 01:00.435
<i>I smell snow.</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:34.762
Hey!

01:35.721 --> 01:37.723
That's how you look
when you get off a plane?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.057
That's how you say hello?

01:39.141 --> 01:42.560
You've been stuffed in a tin can
for seven hours surrounded by people

01:42.645 --> 01:46.023
with consumption, diphtheria, scabies,
hummus dip, rabid dogs,

01:46.106 --> 01:49.109
drugged up children attacking
your chair, stealing your change.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.779
-What airline are you flying?
-You should look drawn and blotchy.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.364
You should be singing "I Dreamed a Dream"
with a bad haircut

01:54.447 --> 01:57.200
while selling yourself
to a bunch of French dockworkers.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.828
Instead, you look perfect.
Admit it. You've been gooped.

01:59.912 --> 02:00.996
I have not been gooped.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.666
You're doing yoga in the aisles
in cashmere sweatpants

02:03.749 --> 02:06.627
while your comfort dog watches
<i>Zoolander 2</i> on his watch.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.545
I do blood clot prevention foot pumps

02:08.629 --> 02:10.463
wearing my Yonah Schimmel Knishery
baseball cap

02:10.547 --> 02:12.174
while toothpaste dries up
a zit on my chin.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.425
Wow! Winded!

02:13.508 --> 02:15.135
-Haven't done that for a while.
-Felt good.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.390
-I've missed you, kid.
-Missed you, too.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.226
-How long's it been?
-Feels like years.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.148
- Coffee and tacos.
- Princess Charlotte iced tea spoons.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.524
Mmm!

02:29.607 --> 02:31.359
All right, shall we
get it out of the way?

02:31.443 --> 02:32.653
Might as well.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.739
One day? That's all?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.115
I'm sorry!

02:37.199 --> 02:41.328
You miss Christmas and Thanksgiving
and all I get is a one day visit?

02:41.411 --> 02:42.620
What am I, chopped liver?

02:42.705 --> 02:44.707
I have to be on the red-eye
to London tomorrow.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.541
-London again.
-For work.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.254
-Oh, now, Emily.
-Oh, wow! Nicely played.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.255
All right, you win.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.424
We have limited time.
Should we skip the town tour?

02:54.507 --> 02:57.469
-We can't skip the town tour.
-Well, we'll keep it short.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.097
-Le Chat Club closed due to rats.
-Again?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.349
-We got parking meters.
-Where?

03:02.432 --> 03:03.976
No one would pay
so they took them out.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.143
This town is mob ruled.

03:05.227 --> 03:08.105
Al's Pancake World won
best Christmas decorations again.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.065
It's that nativity scene
with eggplant Jesus.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.067
-You can't beat it.
-There's a debate

03:12.150 --> 03:13.736
about taking the phone booth out.

03:13.819 --> 03:14.986
Where would Superman change

03:15.070 --> 03:16.905
when he comes to save our town
from Ben Affleck?

03:16.988 --> 03:19.866
-I made the same excellent point.
-What's with the signs?

03:19.950 --> 03:21.534
Ooh, I saved the best for last.

03:21.618 --> 03:25.122
Taylor has decided that septic systems
are beneath us

03:25.205 --> 03:28.208
-and he wants to go full-on sewer.
-How can we do that?

03:28.291 --> 03:32.755
He's going door to door collecting
people's septic tank horror stories.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.714
-Oh, Lord!
-Then, he'll compile them,

03:34.798 --> 03:39.803
then he and a panel will stage testimonial
re-enactments for the county assessor.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.679
Are you telling me this
to get me to stay longer?

03:41.764 --> 03:42.848
-Is it working?
-Kind of.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.141
Hi, Miss Patty!

03:44.725 --> 03:47.769
Rory! You look fabulous!

03:47.853 --> 03:49.521
She just got off a plane!

03:49.604 --> 03:51.314
Oh! That's my work phone.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.360
-It's not ringing.
-Yeah, I know.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.694
-It's not ringing, either.
-I know.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.698
-You've got more burners than Omar Little.
-I got a personal phone, a work phone,

03:59.782 --> 04:02.409
and the phone that gets reception
in Stars Hollow. Theoretically.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.162
The fact that the entire town
was actually constructed

04:05.245 --> 04:08.415
in a giant snow globe probably has
an effect on your bar count.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.875
Ha!

04:09.958 --> 04:12.585
Hello? Hello? Um...

04:12.669 --> 04:14.212
Damn! Hello?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.506
You're breaking up.

04:17.174 --> 04:18.550
Oh, come on.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.804
Hello?

04:21.887 --> 04:24.264
Hold on! Hello?

04:24.347 --> 04:26.934
Crap! Hello?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.186
Hi, can you hear me now?
Can you hear me--

04:29.269 --> 04:30.687
Yes! Hi! Great!

04:30.771 --> 04:33.190
Um, so, how are you?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.108
Hello?

04:35.192 --> 04:38.821
I'm heading to the trees!
I'm... I'm heading to the trees.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.782
Okay, I'm at the trees.
Hello? Hello?

04:42.825 --> 04:44.952
I'm gonna try Doose's.
You coming?

04:45.035 --> 04:46.619
-Nah! I just hit my steps.
-Okay.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.247
Um, hello?

04:49.331 --> 04:52.000
Are you still there?
Okay, flip phone!

04:54.586 --> 04:58.340
Hi! Sorry, it's Rory Gilmore again.
I think Ingrid just--

04:58.423 --> 05:00.717
Hello? Hello?

05:01.218 --> 05:02.594
Hello? Crap!

05:03.720 --> 05:04.846
Hello?

05:05.263 --> 05:06.473
Hello?

05:06.556 --> 05:08.892
Oh, yes! Sure, she can.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.727
Okay, on this number, please.
Thank you.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.146
Rory! Hey! I didn't know
you were coming in today.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.190
Oh, it's just a super quick in and out.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.275
-Cabbage.
-What? Oh.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.444
Come again.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.571
Um, so tell me,
what is going on with you?

05:21.654 --> 05:23.365
-Oh, you don't wanna know.
-Uh-oh.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.951
-Yeah, Zach got a promotion.
-My God! Why?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.995
-I don't know. I think they like him.
-Poor guy.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.663
Yeah, he's a route supervisor now.
Has to wear a tie.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.958
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fairly devastating.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.792
I tell him he looks
like a young Leonard Cohen,

05:34.876 --> 05:36.002
but he looks like his dad.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.212
Sorry.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.631
-Yeah.
-Hello? Oh, Ingrid. Finally!

05:41.758 --> 05:43.009
It's so good to finally connect.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.388
Lorelai, I'm glad I ran into you.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.141
-Your house is that way, Kirk.
-I did not get lost again.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.977
I wanted you to know
that I've started a new business.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.146
It's a ride share business.
I call it Ööö-ber.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.815
Uh-oh. There's already an Uber, Kirk.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.486
No, not Uber.
Ööö-ber. Three "O's" instead of a "U."

06:01.569 --> 06:03.821
-Okay, but it's, uh--
-Ööö-ber.

06:03.906 --> 06:06.199
-Right. But it's the--
-Ööö-ber.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.702
It's a service where people can request
a ride and I will pick them up.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.830
-Like Uber.
-Except it's Ööö-ber.

06:12.915 --> 06:13.999
It's the same thing.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.708
- No, it's not.
- Kirk.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.252
People use an app to call a car.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.337
-I have no app.
-Then how do they get a car?

06:19.421 --> 06:22.465
They call my mother, she calls me,
I find a car and I pick them up.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.760
-So it's a much worse version of Uber.
-And it's pronounced Ööö-ber.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.847
-Stop making that sound.
-All right. You've got my mom's number.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.974
Now if you'll excuse me...

06:31.057 --> 06:33.435
-it is past Petal's bedtime.
-Bye, Petal.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.814
When did Kirk get a pig?

06:37.897 --> 06:40.233
Babette heard him and Lulu
talking about having a baby,

06:40.317 --> 06:43.069
so the whole town chipped in.
It bought us a couple of years.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.404
-Very smart.
-Ready?

06:44.487 --> 06:45.738
Hold on.

06:45.822 --> 06:49.867
I'm not really home
till I get my <i>Stars Hollow Gazette.</i>

06:49.952 --> 06:51.036
Christmas edition.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.957
Manger news, Santa's wishes,
eggnog checkpoints, and...

06:55.040 --> 06:56.249
the Christmas poem.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.585
-Same one every year.
-Every single year.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.128
So good to be home.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.966
What?

07:04.049 --> 07:05.550
I smell snow.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.255
- Got it?
- Yup.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.175
Are you sure?

08:28.258 --> 08:31.761
- Oh, yes.
- Come on. Let's get in out of the snow!

08:31.844 --> 08:33.138
Let's go!

08:37.017 --> 08:39.394
Luke's gonna be
so excited to see you.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.688
I can't wait to see him.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.069
Hello, Rabbi.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.529
Oh, Paul Anka,
what is she making you wear now?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.031
No, no.
This one was his idea.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.325
Aw, don't feel bad.
She did the same thing to me.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.992
-Okay, get ready.
-For what?

08:55.077 --> 08:56.536
-Super-proud Luke.
-What?

08:56.619 --> 08:59.497
Luke! It's a Christmas miracle!

08:59.581 --> 09:02.334
-Ah! There she is, the <i>New Yorker</i> writer!
-Super-proud!

09:02.417 --> 09:03.960
It was just one Talk of the Town piece.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.628
Oh, one Talk of the Town piece?
Come on.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.797
It was terrific.
And that woman you wrote about--

09:07.880 --> 09:10.217
-Naomi Shropshire.
-Yes! I've never heard of her.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.385
-Now I feel like I've met her.
-I appreciate that.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.138
I've never read the <i>New Yorker</i> before,
but now, every week.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.264
I'm glad.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.266
I subscribed to it.
Who says print is dead?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.977
-Only the world.
-Well, what does the world--

09:21.061 --> 09:22.687
-You're eating?
-Just tacos.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.606
-Tacos are tiny.
-I'm making dinner.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.940
-Wow. So I'm fat?
-What?

09:26.023 --> 09:27.567
-Body shaming.
-I am not body shaming.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.361
-Trigger warnings!
-Oh, for Christ's sake.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.696
-War on Christmas!
-I am making two main courses

09:31.779 --> 09:33.490
because you told me
to make two main courses.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.033
-What two main courses?
-Mac and cheese, parmesan cutlets...

09:36.118 --> 09:37.785
-With garlic bread?
-And tater tots!

09:37.869 --> 09:38.953
I am not making tater tots.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.413
-Why not?
-We need sustenance!

09:40.497 --> 09:42.707
-You're eating tacos!
-Tater tots go great with tacos.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.167
Tater tots are great in tacos.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.335
- Yes!
- No!

09:45.418 --> 09:46.794
-Hey! I mean it!
-They're organic.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.255
All right, negotiation's over!

09:48.338 --> 09:50.465
Put the tater tots back,
finish your tacos,

09:50.548 --> 09:52.259
wash your hands,
dinner's almost ready!

09:52.342 --> 09:53.968
Ah! And I saw you grab
those mini donuts.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.262
Put 'em down right now.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.805
I cannot believe the conversations
I have in this room.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.807
I thought cooking was supposed
to be relaxing.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.017
Oh, no.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.936
Don't put that song on
and disappear into Rory's room. Hey!

10:04.020 --> 10:05.062
At least turn it down!

10:05.147 --> 10:06.648
-Did my boxes get here?
-Behind the rack.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.732
Great!

10:07.815 --> 10:11.903
So, you finally did it, huh?
Finally gave up the Brooklyn pad?

10:11.986 --> 10:14.864
I did. Lena Dunham will just have
to get along without me.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.533
-Are you gonna miss it?
-A little.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.742
I'm gonna miss it.

10:17.826 --> 10:21.913
It had that early American
tenement shtetl slash <i>Trainspotting</i> vibe

10:21.996 --> 10:24.040
that every mother wants
for her little girl.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.917
It was a perfectly decent apartment.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.045
I liked how you had to avoid the walls
or you'd stick to them.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.088
-One wall.
-See, in some apartments,

10:31.173 --> 10:32.715
you don't have to avoid any walls.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.967
It was a great place.
I just was never there.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.179
Do you know how many nights
I spent there this year?

10:37.262 --> 10:38.805
-Three? Eighteen?
-No. No.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.223
-Forty-six?
-No.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.518
Is this <i>The Price is Right?</i>
If I'm a little under I win, over, I lose?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.478
I don't know exactly
how many nights, okay?

10:45.562 --> 10:47.772
It was not a lot.
Now the building's going condo.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.983
I'm not ready to buy a condo,
so it seemed like the time to say...

10:51.067 --> 10:52.860
-Bye-bye, Brooklyn.
-Bye-bye, Brooklyn.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.321
This box is open.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.989
- Damn that TSA!
- Really? You went through my stuff?

10:57.073 --> 11:00.202
I did. And I must say,
I found it very disappointing.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.036
You found my personal items disappointing?

11:02.119 --> 11:03.955
I thought there'd be
something fun in there,

11:04.038 --> 11:06.958
like a treasure map
or the prequel to <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>

11:07.041 --> 11:09.877
where Huck is a Klan leader
and terrified of water.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.504
I think it's kind of exciting,
you know?

11:11.588 --> 11:13.631
No apartment, no rent, no ties.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.508
I could crash here,
I could crash at Lane's.

11:15.592 --> 11:20.263
I feel like this is my time to be rootless
and just see where life takes me,

11:20.347 --> 11:23.182
and travel wherever there's
a story to write.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.310
I just wish I had remembered
to label my boxes

11:25.393 --> 11:27.312
because now I know where nothing is.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.314
My boots, my coats, my underwear...

11:29.397 --> 11:32.024
-You don't know where your underwear is?
-Could be at Lane's.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.151
You've been without your underwear
since you moved?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.152
Don't judge.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.614
I'm Gwen freakin' Stefani.
Want to borrow some underwear?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.992
I'd like to stop talking about underwear.
I'm looking for my lucky outfit.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.036
Any outfit you wear without underwear
will be your lucky outfit.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.038
I have a big meeting with Condé Nast

11:46.122 --> 11:48.916
and I have this look
that makes me feel like Diane Sawyer.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.209
Is it a Mike Nichols mask?

11:50.293 --> 11:52.003
I'll get it!

11:52.086 --> 11:53.087
What's this?

11:53.170 --> 11:56.883
Oh! That is a box of <i>New Yorker</i> magazines
with your fancy piece in it.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.134
Box one of six.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.969
-You're kidding.
-Super-proud!

12:00.052 --> 12:01.388
Hey, that guy's here.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.140
- What guy?
- You know... uh, Jeffrey.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.850
-Who? Who?
-Allen? Billy?

12:05.933 --> 12:08.227
There's nothing remotely similar
about those names.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.563
-You know. Him. Your guy.
-Paul?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.023
-Paul. Yes, Paul.
-Paul's not here.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.232
- Paul's here.
- Who's Paul?

12:13.316 --> 12:17.028
Paul, my... Paul, my boyfriend?
Oh, crap! Paul is here!

12:17.111 --> 12:18.821
- Why is Paul here?
- I invited him for dinner,

12:18.905 --> 12:22.784
and I totally forgot.
Crap, crap, crap!

12:22.867 --> 12:25.245
I can't believe you forgot
Rory's boyfriend Paul.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.831
You came.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.750
Of course I came.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.878
-For you.
-So beautiful.

12:33.961 --> 12:37.173
- And indigenous to Peru. Fun fact.
- So fun.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.259
- Hey. Look who's here.
- Paul! Wow!

12:40.343 --> 12:41.469
-So good to see you.
-You, too.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.680
-Thank you for the invite.
-Is your hair different?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.181
-Uh, no.
-Lose some weight?

12:45.264 --> 12:46.641
- Nope.
- Gain some weight?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.142
I'm going to put these in water.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.936
-Come on, Paul.
-Yes, I will follow.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.065
I've never seen that boy before.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.608
-See?
-They've been together for months.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.360
-I think it's been a year.
-He's been to the house!

12:57.444 --> 12:58.445
I know!

12:58.528 --> 13:01.280
He's like a superhero, but his power
is that you can't remember him

13:01.364 --> 13:02.532
no matter how much time
you spend with him.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.617
Kind of like every Marvel movie ever.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.661
-Care for something to drink, Pete?
-Paul.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.912
Paul. I'm--

13:07.995 --> 13:10.957
Pete is our, uh, dog's friend.
Our dog's name is Paul.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.917
-Last name Anka.
-Weirdly close to my last name.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.878
-Right. Very close.
-This is all I could find.

13:15.962 --> 13:16.963
- That'll do.
- Okay.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.130
- Red okay...
- Paul.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.967
-I got it now. Paul, red, Paul?
-Red sounds good.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.677
-Oh, hey, Luke.
-Yeah.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.261
-I brought it.
-You...

13:24.346 --> 13:27.223
The antique wrench
we talked about the last time I was here.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.475
-Remember?
-Uh-huh.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.767
We went fishing on your boat.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.269
You told me your dad owned
a hardware store. Now it's a diner.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.356
I told you my grandfather
owned a hardware store

13:34.439 --> 13:35.607
and I kept all of his tools?

13:35.690 --> 13:36.774
I remember the boat.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.651
You said your dad
had a wrench that he loved

13:38.735 --> 13:39.861
and you wish you'd kept it.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.154
My grandfather also had one
that he loved and I did keep it.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.031
I'll go get it.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.325
I just forgot the entire conversation
we just had.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.035
Come on, guys.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.037
Thanks for inviting me over,
by the way.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.873
I don't get to see
a lot of Rory these days.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.876
At least I get to see her
for our anniversary, which is great.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.836
Can you believe it's two years?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.838
The cotton anniversary.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.466
Okay, I got it.
Here we go.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.719
Here it is.
Look at the, uh, date on the back.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.263
- Oh! And Lorelai...
- Huh?

14:08.180 --> 14:09.974
The virus protection software
I told you about.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.476
Want me to pop it on your computer?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.185
-Where is it? All right.
-Living room.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.480
It's got the Sadness stickers
from <i>Inside Out</i> on it?

14:15.563 --> 14:17.815
- You remembered.
- Okay.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.903
-It's nice that he remembered.
-It's nice that somebody remembered.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.613
This is a very nice wrench.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.577
- What the hell did you do here?
- What?

14:29.661 --> 14:31.496
The DVR is completely full.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.123
I have no idea
what any of these things are.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.626
<i>Restless Virgins, Deadly Honeymoon...</i>

14:36.709 --> 14:37.919
Lifetime Movie Channel classics.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.046
<i>Killer Crush, Mini's First Time.</i>

14:40.129 --> 14:42.840
A rebellious girl hooks up
with an escort agency

14:42.924 --> 14:45.968
where her stepfather is a client.
Alec Baldwin. Pre-yoga.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.303
-So, keep?
-Keep.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.472
-Okay. <i>Accidental Obsession.</i>
-Keep.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.098
<i>-Murder in a College Town.</i>
-Keep.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.308
<i>-Crimes of the Mind.</i>
-Keep!

14:52.392 --> 14:56.521
<i>Fatal Acquittal, Not With My Daughter,</i>
<i>Baby Sellers, Unfinished Betrayal,</i>

14:56.604 --> 14:58.940
<i>The Girl He Met Online,</i>
<i>The Boy He Met Online,</i>

14:59.023 --> 15:01.275
<i>Deadly Vows, Lying Eyes, Lies He Told,</i>

15:01.358 --> 15:02.610
<i>My Nanny's Secret.</i>

15:02.694 --> 15:04.862
Did the remote break?
Do we only get one channel now?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.823
-Where's my pajamas?
-In the drawer.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.533
-Ugh. Felix...
-Oscar...

15:08.616 --> 15:11.578
I like my pajamas on the chair,
all crinkled up and ready for bed,

15:11.661 --> 15:12.745
not suffocating in a drawer.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.330
Your pajamas are not puppies.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.499
You should find my bedtime rituals
endearing by now.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.750
What's taking you so long?

15:17.834 --> 15:20.211
You know, I still can't get over
that piece Rory wrote.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.297
Oh, really? 'Cause you've been
so stingy with your praise.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.382
Are those...

15:25.467 --> 15:27.343
-Puppies!
-Right.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.390
-That is one great kid you got.
-Eh, she's all right.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.018
She's freaked out she's gonna hear
our rollicking lovemaking.

15:36.102 --> 15:40.314
- What are you doing?
- Organizing my magazines by Kardashian.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.399
-You're stalling.
-I'm organizing.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.401
You're not going
to have your dream tonight.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.154
My dirty bathroom dream?
Yes, I am.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.656
Just come to bed!

15:48.740 --> 15:50.658
Five nights in a row.
Five nights in a row!

15:50.742 --> 15:53.244
I'm looking for a bathroom
and then I find one

15:53.327 --> 15:55.455
and it's like the <i>Eastern Promises</i>
steam room scene,

15:55.538 --> 15:57.373
only the stuff on the walls ain't blood.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.251
-Don't think about it.
-The bathrooms are all giant.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.294
There's stalls
and urinals, urinals, urinals...

16:02.378 --> 16:03.295
It's a dream!

16:03.379 --> 16:05.840
Last night, it was the bathroom
at the Radio City Music Hall.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.175
-The Rockettes were there.
-Okay.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.926
-They kept slipping.
-I got it.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.553
Let's just sleep standing up like cows.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.556
You come to bed, you can watch
one of these ridiculous movies.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.224
-All the way through?
-Yes.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.394
You won't turn it off
when the suspicious sister, co-worker,

16:18.478 --> 16:21.564
or gay best friend investigates
the abandoned cabin by the lake

16:21.647 --> 16:23.566
where they find proof
to expose the killer

16:23.649 --> 16:25.401
and they get hit in the head
with a hammer?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.654
- Nope.
- Rory will think we're rollicking.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.446
Well, no one ever said she was dumb.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.995
<i>The deal for $49 billion</i>
<i>or about $95 per...</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:38.665
Don't touch the handle!

16:38.748 --> 16:40.082
<i>...boards have approved the deal</i>

16:40.166 --> 16:42.877
<i>and now begin</i>
<i>the long regulatory process that follows.</i>

16:42.960 --> 16:44.754
<i>- All of this--</i>

16:53.596 --> 16:56.307
<i>...four, five, six, seven, eight.</i>

16:56.390 --> 16:59.602
<i>Repeat from the top.</i>
<i>A five, six, seven, eight...</i>

16:59.686 --> 17:03.523
<i>Shuffle, a three,</i>
<i>a five, a seven and a flap.</i>

17:03.606 --> 17:06.693
<i>Flap, flap, ball change,</i>
<i>flap, flap, flap, again.</i>

17:06.776 --> 17:08.653
<i>Shuffle! A three!</i>

17:08.736 --> 17:09.862
Too loud?

17:09.946 --> 17:12.574
-No. Just loud enough.
<i>-Ball change...</i>

17:12.657 --> 17:14.909
-What you doing?
-Stress tap dancing.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.119
Helps get out my anxieties.
Keeps me calm.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.539
How long have you been
tapping your troubles away?

17:19.622 --> 17:22.041
About a month.
I needed something to shut my brain off.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.252
I tried meditation. Tried jogging.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.046
Then I read about this.
Now, when I can't sleep,

17:27.129 --> 17:28.673
-I get up and tap!
-Cool.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.508
-You know you're terrible.
-Yeah, I know.

17:31.593 --> 17:32.885
<i>Six, seven and shuffle!</i>

17:32.969 --> 17:34.220
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.430
-Do not get your phone.
-What are you talking about?

17:36.513 --> 17:38.641
-Do not film this.
-I'm checking on Paul Anka.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.976
Dance numbers terrify him.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.145
This is my stress relief.
Do not make my stress relief stressful!

17:43.229 --> 17:44.647
-Damn it. Where is it?
-I hid it.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.440
You are awful.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.484
You think I don't know you?
I have your eyes.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.027
-Fine.
-You want some coffee?

17:50.111 --> 17:52.697
- Yes, please.
- You sure I didn't wake you up?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.741
Not unless you were dressed
like a urinal cake.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.909
You hungry?

17:56.993 --> 17:59.662
- 'Cause you said "cake"?
- Yes.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.913
Kind of.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.421
-It's so nice to have you home.
-I wish you were sleeping.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.675
-I wish you were sleeping.
-Well, I have a lot on my mind.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.094
-My piece for the <i>Atlantic</i> fell through.
-No! When?

18:15.177 --> 18:18.055
-Today. That was the call that I got.
-Why?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.391
They just bumped it for other stuff.
It happens.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.726
Sorry.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.186
It's okay.
I have a lot of irons in the fire.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.356
I'm still getting a lot of good responses
from the <i>New Yorker</i> piece so...

18:27.439 --> 18:29.901
Did I tell you
that I attacked Gail Collins?

18:29.984 --> 18:32.528
-You did not.
-I was in the lobby of the Times Building,

18:32.612 --> 18:36.240
hoping to talk to the metro editor.
Suddenly, Gail Collins walks in.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.575
I had met her once
at the 92nd Street Y.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.245
I wasn't expecting to see her
and I was jacked up on coffee

18:41.328 --> 18:43.372
and I just lunged at her,

18:43.455 --> 18:45.833
which she interpreted
as a stranger lunging at her.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.584
-So sensitive.
-I felt so stupid.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.170
She was freaking out.
She gave me her wallet.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.798
- Did you keep it?
- No.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.966
But, I don't know,
she was really nice about it.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.344
She realized who I was and asked
the security guards to get off me.

18:57.428 --> 19:01.140
Well, here's the upside.
You definitely made an impression.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.685
It's okay.
I have a lot of irons in the fire.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.227
I heard.
You should become a blacksmith.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.979
What about you?

19:07.063 --> 19:10.316
-Mmm... what about me?
-Are you having the dreams again?

19:10.399 --> 19:14.611
I'm just stressed out
and kind of feeling my mortality lately.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.239
-What do you mean?
-The other day, a guest left a brochure

19:17.323 --> 19:18.615
in their room after they checked out.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.703
It was for <i>Anthem of the Seas.</i>
So I'm flipping through,

19:21.786 --> 19:24.706
looking at swimming pools
and pictures of the buffet.

19:24.789 --> 19:28.125
Everything's planned
and they have Wi-Fi and <i>Rock of Ages</i>

19:28.209 --> 19:31.003
and you don't have to bring money.
I found myself thinking...

19:31.087 --> 19:33.005
-No.
-maybe it would be nice

19:33.089 --> 19:34.173
to take a cruise!

19:34.256 --> 19:35.967
-No!
-And then I broke a hip.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.219
-You are not going on a cruise.
-I know.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.681
-Is everything okay with Luke?
-Yeah, everything's fine.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.558
I annoy him and he builds cabinets.
Or that's what I think.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.102
He says we need the storage.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.437
Do you think it's because of Grandpa?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.731
My sudden need to cruise?

19:51.733 --> 19:53.735
-Yeah.
-No.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.487
I don't know.
Maybe.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.530
I miss him.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.412
To absent friends.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.540
To absent friends.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.877
People might say drinking coffee
in the middle of the night

20:11.961 --> 20:13.129
could hinder your sleep.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.588
People are dumb.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.693
Caesar, let's go! Where's my toast?

20:35.777 --> 20:37.069
-Toaster's down.
-What?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.864
Oh, wait, it's just unplugged.
Toast coming right up.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.868
Over easy, scrambled soft,
whites with cheese. Coffee?

20:43.951 --> 20:45.077
What's the Wi-Fi password?

20:45.161 --> 20:47.789
- Dinerluke. Capital "D," small "L."
- Pick up!

20:47.872 --> 20:51.625
Luke, I need to talk to you
about your septic tank testimonial.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.086
I'm not giving you
a septic tank testimonial, Taylor.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.047
If you're confused by what I need,

20:56.130 --> 20:58.758
I brought some sample testimonials
to guide you.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.427
I think you'll find
Mimsy Frupp's description

21:01.510 --> 21:03.637
of her granddaughter's disastrous day

21:03.720 --> 21:06.723
jumping into fall leaves
especially edifying.

21:06.808 --> 21:10.561
She thought the tyke was diving
into an autumnal paradise.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.897
Instead she found herself submerged--

21:12.980 --> 21:15.775
- Taylor, order something or get out.
- Fine.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.819
New menu. I'll need a minute.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.237
Excuse me. Password?

21:20.321 --> 21:22.364
DINERDANES321. All caps.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.826
- Hey, there she is! Get in here!
- What about me?

21:24.909 --> 21:26.368
Ah, you get in here, too.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.370
- Should I be nervous?
- As a rule, yes.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.332
Okay. Something I want you to see.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.334
New menus.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.794
Very nice.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.046
-Notice anything?
-Oh... nope.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.047
Turn it over.

21:39.966 --> 21:43.260
-That's my <i>New Yorker</i> piece. Wow!
-Super-proud!

21:43.344 --> 21:44.887
For everyone to read.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.973
-Now what can I get you?
-Coffee, please.

21:47.056 --> 21:50.267
-I have a list and I need it all to go.
-You got it.

21:52.019 --> 21:55.147
- That's my piece.
- Wrapped in plastic.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.566
You knew when Luke moved in with me
he'd turn weird.

21:57.649 --> 22:01.195
Thanks for your patronage!
Be sure to call my mom and rate me!

22:01.278 --> 22:03.364
Five stars is appreciated!

22:04.866 --> 22:06.909
First official fare!

22:06.993 --> 22:09.786
That elderly woman
that I successfully drove here?

22:09.871 --> 22:13.875
That is widow Joy Puddleston
from 88 Peach Tree Drive.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.210
Right now,
thanks to my new business,

22:16.293 --> 22:19.713
Widow Puddleston
is only ten minutes late for chemo!

22:19.796 --> 22:20.797
Are you ordering?

22:20.882 --> 22:23.509
Fudgy banana milkshake.
I am flying, man!

22:23.592 --> 22:25.219
-This is gonna work.
-Terrific.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.556
-This area over here would be perfect.
-Perfect for what, Kirk?

22:28.639 --> 22:31.433
Have you heard about
my new business, Luke? Ööö-ber?

22:31.517 --> 22:32.518
Do not make that sound!

22:32.601 --> 22:36.564
I need to find a place where,
after people call, they can get picked up.

22:36.647 --> 22:39.525
-This corner would work.
-That's not how Uber works.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.318
Well, this isn't Uber, this is...

22:42.278 --> 22:45.156
Luke, you need to control your woman.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.823
Oh!

22:47.449 --> 22:48.825
Those aren't even your bagels!

22:48.910 --> 22:50.577
I'm buying them new ones.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.540
Oh, crap! I forgot about Paul?

22:54.623 --> 22:57.043
You're kidding!
He was at the house this whole time?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.670
-Didn't you notice his car out front?
-No, didn't you?

22:59.753 --> 23:01.463
There you are.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.340
Hi, Paul.
I'm so sorry, I just--

23:03.424 --> 23:06.427
It was my fault. I needed her
to come look at something with me.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.305
I forgot to leave you a note.
And it's--

23:09.388 --> 23:12.516
-I was about to call you. Are you hungry?
-Not really.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.643
-Not really?
-I'm not a breakfast person.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.187
As in, you already had breakfast?

23:16.270 --> 23:17.896
-No.
-Did you know about this?

23:17.980 --> 23:19.523
I'm gonna wash my hands.
Order me a tea?

23:19.606 --> 23:20.732
-Tea? No.
-Yes.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.984
-Go on.
-Okay.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.198
-You have got to cut that poor boy loose.
-I keep meaning to and I keep...

23:27.281 --> 23:29.075
- Forgetting!
- So, so sad!

23:29.158 --> 23:32.953
Your breakfast list, coffee to go.
Have a good flight. Come back soon.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.414
- And take a menu.
- Thanks, Luke.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.003
-Bye.
-Bye.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.727
Crap, crap, crap! Ooh!

23:58.229 --> 23:59.771
-Hey, got the food.
-Ready to go?

23:59.855 --> 24:01.523
Absolutely.

24:04.986 --> 24:06.487
I just don't understand it.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.863
Before we got married,

24:07.946 --> 24:10.282
Frederick was more indifferent
to children than I am.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.950
-That's not possible.
-Oh, yes.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.327
We could be walking by the well

24:13.410 --> 24:15.704
that Timmy fell down
and he'd throw a penny in.

24:15.787 --> 24:19.500
-Maybe he kept his feelings to himself.
-For five years? No.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.959
Something happened.

24:21.043 --> 24:24.130
Twenty minutes after "I do,"
he lost his mind.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.423
Now all he talks about is,
"Guess who's pregnant?"

24:26.507 --> 24:28.342
or "What school district is it in?

24:28.425 --> 24:30.344
You have to live
in a good school district."

24:30.427 --> 24:33.305
And I say, "Why?
Isn't that what boarding school is for?

24:33.389 --> 24:35.516
So you don't have to live
in a good school district?"

24:35.599 --> 24:37.643
I don't think
that's what boarding school's for.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.395
Well, it's very mystifying.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.605
He keeps shoving children in my arms.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.524
"Hold this. What do you feel?"

24:43.607 --> 24:46.860
"Well, now there's spittle
on my Brioni suit so, rage?"

24:46.943 --> 24:50.531
-Why does it smell like onions?
-The new pop-up crew in the kitchen.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.367
- That's tonight?
- Yes, that's tonight.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.745
-I hate this pop-up idea.
-We have an empty dining room and kitchen.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.997
-What do you propose we do?
-Put on a show?

24:59.081 --> 25:02.209
We live in a town
where every restaurant closes at 4:45.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.294
People need to eat.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.338
-What's this new chef guy's name again?
-Oh, come on.

25:06.422 --> 25:09.133
I can't remember.
It's like a million syllables long.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.717
Roy Choi.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.844
-The food truck guy.
-He's not a food truck guy.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.221
He's a guy with a food truck.

25:14.305 --> 25:18.434
A fleet of food trucks, three restaurants
and a massive online following.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.352
Oh, so he tweets? He's a tweeter?

25:20.436 --> 25:24.231
"Hey, kids. Come grab some rad food
at the Dragonfly."

25:24.315 --> 25:25.732
Do you even know how Twitter works?

25:25.816 --> 25:28.652
-Oh, he's cool, right?
-Yes, he seems cool.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.821
I hate cool.
Makes me feel so uncool.

25:30.904 --> 25:35.784
I don't need some cool guy tweeting,
making me feel uncool in my own inn.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.037
Why on earth aren't you on Xanax?
It was invented for you.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.956
What's that "Kogi" tattoo
on his arm about?

25:41.039 --> 25:42.499
Kogi is the name of his business.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.086
So the tattoo, while not
as clever as "Wino Forever,"

25:45.169 --> 25:46.837
is at least thematically correct.

25:46.920 --> 25:50.048
-We should hire a regular chef.
-We should, shouldn't we?

25:50.132 --> 25:52.093
-How long is this pop-up thing?
-Two weeks.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.302
-Can it be less?
-No.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.887
-I'd like it to be less.
-I don't need a child. I have you.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.892
Great. He's gonna
set the whole place on fire.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.936
- Oh, hey, Lorelai.
- Hey.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.356
This kitchen's awesome.
Sookie set it up perfectly.

26:05.439 --> 26:06.982
Yes, well, Sookie's a genius.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.650
-What is all this?
-You like abalone?

26:08.734 --> 26:12.196
-Is this a trick question?
-No. Abalone is delicious.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.241
I'm doing a green pea congee
with fried shallots, spring onions,

26:15.324 --> 26:18.619
cilantro, chili oil and abalone.
Oh, I meant to ask.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.912
Can I screw with the dining room?
Make it less granny?

26:20.996 --> 26:22.581
-Uh, no.
-Problem. No problem.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.374
De-granny the place.

26:24.458 --> 26:27.419
Go nuts. I hated my grandmother.
Horrible woman.

26:27.503 --> 26:30.672
But we are thrilled that you are here.
And she's not.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.841
All right, come on, you guys. Let's go.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.385
Thank you.

26:34.468 --> 26:37.929
Abalone! Yay!

26:39.181 --> 26:40.391
Will you relax, please?

26:40.474 --> 26:43.018
Between you and Frederick,
I'm going to have a stroke.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.686
-Where is it?
-What?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.688
The coffeemaker.
Where is the coffeemaker?

26:46.772 --> 26:48.732
-Uh...
-It was right here yesterday!

26:48.815 --> 26:51.818
- It was right here! Roy!
- Uh, I... Wait...

26:51.902 --> 26:56.282
Roy! Um, Roy?
Where's the coffee machine?

26:56.365 --> 26:59.535
I moved it. I needed counter space.
Eduardo can make you a coffee.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.246
-How? Is Eduardo magic?
-He makes a stovetop version--

27:02.329 --> 27:03.372
-Eh, eh.
-It really is--

27:03.455 --> 27:04.956
-Eh, eh, eh, eh.
-I can move it back.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.958
I am so sorry,
but this isn't gonna to work.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.084
-Michel!
-I'm right here.

27:08.169 --> 27:12.130
Oh, sorry. Uh, Michel, call over
to Momo's and see if they can accommodate

27:12.214 --> 27:14.591
a crazy cool congee extravaganza.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.802
Thank you. It's been a pleasure.

27:16.885 --> 27:20.597
Louis here is gonna walk you over
to Momo's Tires and get you settled.

27:20.681 --> 27:23.767
- Wait, it's a tire store?
- Buh-bye. Thank you.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.270
What, Michel?

27:26.353 --> 27:28.939
At least you were nicer
than you were to Anthony Bourdain.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.441
Bourdain parked in Sookie's spot.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.652
Now once again,
we have an empty kitchen.

27:33.735 --> 27:34.820
We will find a full-time chef.

27:34.903 --> 27:35.946
-No, we won't.
-Yes, we will.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.239
You think no one can cook like her.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.824
-No one can.
-April Bloomfield?

27:38.907 --> 27:40.075
-Too much pork.
-Alice Waters.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.118
- Little flighty.
- David Chang?

27:42.203 --> 27:43.704
Al's does the same thing.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.457
Al's Pancake World does not do
the same thing as David Chang.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.000
-It has to be right.
-You miss her? Fine. I don't.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.044
-She abandoned us.
-She did not abandon us.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.297
A six month sabbatical.
That's what she said.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.048
She was going to clear her head,

27:55.132 --> 27:56.884
come up with new recipes
and then be back.

27:56.967 --> 28:00.345
-Well, that was a year ago.
-What can I say? She found a calling.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.389
-Really. What's her calling?
-Michel.

28:02.473 --> 28:05.226
I'm curious.
Describe what she's doing up in the woods?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.478
She's working with Dan Barber
at Blue Hill Farm.

28:07.561 --> 28:08.562
Doing?

28:08.645 --> 28:10.856
She is helping him develop
food-growing techniques

28:10.939 --> 28:13.484
and cultivating
the evolution of fruits and vegetables,

28:13.567 --> 28:16.487
which helps the people who eat them and--

28:16.570 --> 28:19.323
I don't know. They're saving the world.
It's on the website.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.075
No, she's squatting in a cabin
with no phone service,

28:22.158 --> 28:24.286
trying to grow a pineapple
out of a coat rack!

28:24.370 --> 28:25.954
She's not saving the world.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.415
She just found a way
to never shave her legs again.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.750
Ooh! Hi, Gypsy!

28:29.833 --> 28:31.793
<i>-I have good news.</i>
-Great! What?

28:31.877 --> 28:34.671
Oh, Lorelai.
Damn, I dialed the wrong number.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.341
-I'll call you back.
-Wait! When can I get my car?

28:37.424 --> 28:40.927
I'm waiting for a part.
It's coming in a DeLorean from 1983.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.847
-I have to go to Hartford tonight.
<i>-I don't know what to tell you</i>.

28:43.930 --> 28:46.767
Oh, wait, yes I do.
Buy a new car.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.519
-Thanks. Great.
<i>-I hate this one.</i>

28:48.602 --> 28:50.061
-It's very old.
<i>-I got it.</i>

28:50.145 --> 28:52.773
-But it's fun to kick.
<i>-Bye, Gypsy.</i>

28:59.154 --> 29:00.948
Hi, Mrs. Gleason?

29:02.115 --> 29:04.285
Hey, Kirk?
It's freezing back here.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.912
Oh, that's probably because
I vented the floor.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.414
-Pardon?
-The floor.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.624
I drilled a few holes in the floor.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.585
Was there an explanation with that or...

29:13.669 --> 29:15.712
Two customers passed out last week.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.632
They were old, so it could've just been
old people passing out.

29:18.715 --> 29:21.885
Or carbon monoxide.
I just thought better safe than sorry.

29:22.803 --> 29:25.430
-Would you like some water?
-Yes. That would be nice.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.434
Here, could you...

29:28.517 --> 29:31.770
-Oh, uh, okay.
-And how about some music?

29:31.853 --> 29:36.191
The radio was stolen, but I'm happy
to sing any song you request...

29:36.275 --> 29:37.776
as long as it's by the Carpenters.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.612
-How about something by the Carpenters?
-Good choice.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.067
Uh, well, thanks, Kirk.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.736
I'm not there yet.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.949
-You know, I think I'm okay.
-It's door-to-door service.

30:26.032 --> 30:29.703
-Well, I won't tell if you don't.
-I still have to charge the same price.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.456
That's fine, Kirk.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.876
- You have arrived!
- Bye, Kirk.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.883
Oh, <i>hola!</i> Hello.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.886
Hi. Um, uh, I'm Lorelai.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.137
Emily's, um...

30:49.348 --> 30:51.433
No, no, no.
I don't think Rory's here yet.

30:52.601 --> 30:56.146
Um, my, uh, daughter, that's...
That's her.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.981
Ah!

30:58.064 --> 31:00.359
She's not and I'm not gonna be
flying solo tonight,

31:00.442 --> 31:01.985
-so I'm gonna wait outside.
-Oh!

31:02.068 --> 31:04.530
But don't say anything to, uh,
Mrs. Gilmore.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.490
- Oh.
- Okay? Shh. Shh.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.033
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.660
Oh...

31:11.620 --> 31:12.913
Oh, thank God!

31:14.289 --> 31:16.750
Hey, you promised
you'd be here right at 7:00.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.544
-It's 7:05.
-Apology accepted.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.129
-Why are you out here? It's freezing.
-'Cause we're a team.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.964
Would Dean Martin go in
without Jerry Lewis?

31:23.048 --> 31:24.758
No, but Jerry Lewis
would go in without Dean.

31:24.841 --> 31:25.926
Am I Jerry Lewis?

31:26.009 --> 31:27.803
-I'm ringing the doorbell.
-Why am I Jerry Lewis?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.471
I don't need to answer that.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.264
Hmm. Hi, here's Rory.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.392
Ah!

31:33.475 --> 31:34.810
Right.

31:35.394 --> 31:39.481
Rory, there you are.
It is so good to see you.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.067
Hi, Grandma. It's so good to see you.
How are you?

31:42.150 --> 31:43.944
Well, I am a Gilmore.

31:44.027 --> 31:47.698
My goodness, you look absolutely radiant.

31:47.781 --> 31:50.492
Well, she is a Gilmore.
And 32, which helps.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.119
-I think you must be in love.
-Hi, Mom.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.997
Don't track mud in here.
I had the floors waxed.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.416
You and I had a better rapport.

31:57.499 --> 32:00.001
Excuse me, Mrs. Gilmore.

32:00.085 --> 32:03.964
Oh, good, good. In here.
I need light bulbs.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.799
This, there.
You see...

32:05.882 --> 32:07.133
- There and there.
- Ah.

32:07.217 --> 32:09.761
-The bulbs... the bulbs are out.
-Hmm.

32:09.845 --> 32:10.971
-No problem.
-Yeah?

32:11.054 --> 32:13.932
And now... And in here...

32:14.015 --> 32:15.141
that sconce...

32:15.225 --> 32:18.895
and then over the picture, the light.
Over here, the picture...

32:18.979 --> 32:21.982
The... the lights over the picture?
Yes?

32:22.065 --> 32:23.400
Did you get a new handyman, Mom?

32:25.277 --> 32:27.612
-Cyrano?
-Grandma, did you hire a new handyman?

32:27.696 --> 32:29.197
Yes. That's Alejandro.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.408
He's Berta's husband and he's amazing.
He can fix anything.

32:32.493 --> 32:34.620
I'm usually wary about hiring husbands.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.913
I hired a maid once whose husband
was a gardener.

32:36.997 --> 32:40.375
He got angry with her one day
and decapitated one of my topiaries.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.670
Hmm. Was it the one of Spiro Agnew?

32:45.714 --> 32:47.215
-Ask her, ask her.
-Uh, Grandma...

32:47.298 --> 32:49.425
just wondering...
Who are the kids?

32:49.510 --> 32:52.888
-Oh, they're Berta's children, I think.
-You think?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.724
They appeared when she did,
so I put two and two together.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.893
You have an entire family in your house

32:57.976 --> 32:59.895
and you're not sure
if they're actually a family?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.354
So what, Lorelai?

33:01.437 --> 33:03.857
I have a house.
They needed a place to live.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.525
They work for me. Problem?

33:05.609 --> 33:07.486
No. Yes. All good. You're right.

33:07.569 --> 33:11.990
Let's go sit and have martinis.
You can tell me all about this new boy.

33:12.073 --> 33:15.661
Well, he's not new.
We've been going out about two years.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.871
-Really? I must meet him.
-Oh, you did.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.915
Really? I'm sorry.
I'll meet him again.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.042
- Won't matter.
- Come sit.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.794
What?

33:26.547 --> 33:28.840
- Uh, Mom?
- Yes?

33:30.341 --> 33:32.177
- Um...
- Oh, yes.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.678
Isn't it wonderful?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.015
It's...

33:37.098 --> 33:39.350
It's... it's...

33:39.434 --> 33:40.644
It's...

33:41.436 --> 33:42.521
The whole wall!

33:42.604 --> 33:45.273
I had it painted
from one of my favorite pictures of him.

33:45.356 --> 33:46.900
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.151
Sure.

33:49.569 --> 33:54.157
It's so... big.

33:54.658 --> 33:58.453
It's a Marco Toretti.
His specialty is large canvases.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.622
Well, he did himself proud.

34:01.122 --> 34:04.960
-And... you wanted it that big, right?
-Of course I did.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.212
'Cause it's a... a real presence.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.214
As was your father. Olive?

34:09.297 --> 34:11.257
And he came and measured the space?

34:11.341 --> 34:12.884
-Who?
-Mario Andretti?

34:12.968 --> 34:14.886
Marco Toretti. Yes, he did. Why?

34:14.970 --> 34:17.472
-No reason.
-I wanted something dramatic.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.807
And you got it.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.559
- I did.
- Okay.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.103
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.068
Oh, come on, Mom. Admit it.

34:30.151 --> 34:32.237
-Admit what?
-You Spinal Tapped the painting.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.905
-What?
-You Spinal Tapped the painting.

34:33.989 --> 34:37.701
You gave them the wrong dimensions
and now you are trying to pretend

34:37.784 --> 34:40.328
that massive portrait is something
you intended.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.247
-It was. Yes.
-It was?

34:42.330 --> 34:45.541
You intended for Dad's eyebrow
and my forearm to be the same length?

34:45.625 --> 34:47.877
-Yes.
-It's 18-feet tall!

34:47.961 --> 34:49.296
It's not 18-feet tall.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.673
-It looks 18 feet-tall.
-Should I get a tape measure?

34:51.757 --> 34:53.008
-No.
-I can get a tape measure.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.761
-Do not get a tape measure.
-Alejandro has one.

34:55.844 --> 34:59.180
I don't believe you wanted
a portrait of Dad so massive,

34:59.264 --> 35:01.224
-it doesn't fit on the wall!
-Well, I did.

35:01.307 --> 35:04.811
A portrait so big, Peter Jackson
could hang it at the Argonath.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.522
-Yes, he could.
-You don't know what the Argonath is!

35:07.606 --> 35:09.608
Doesn't matter.
It's a nice picture of Grandpa.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.860
Mom. Do it over.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.945
Get what you want.
You have the money.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.907
-This is what I want.
-I swear it can't be.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.366
-Why not?
-Because! Look at it.

35:18.449 --> 35:22.162
It's nuts! "Wizard, you shall not pass!"
Seriously!

35:22.245 --> 35:24.790
Fine! I made a mistake!
Are you happy?

35:24.873 --> 35:27.751
I gave them the wrong dimensions,
and they screwed it up.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.586
I'm a screw-up! I admit it!

35:29.670 --> 35:34.716
Just please, don't let this be the only
thing you remember to say at my funeral!

35:38.219 --> 35:39.888
So...

35:41.556 --> 35:42.724
Yes?

35:43.850 --> 35:47.103
Did I tell you what happened
at the funeral after you left?

35:47.187 --> 35:49.397
Why, no, you didn't.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.317
Because something did.

37:25.827 --> 37:29.455
So nice of you to come.
You're in Florida now, aren't you?

37:29.539 --> 37:32.834
We are. You should come visit us
when things calm down a bit.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.920
I'll do that. I promise.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.884
- Beautiful service, Emily.
- Thank you.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.637
-I'm all right, Rory.
-Okay.

37:45.889 --> 37:48.433
-I really am all right.
-I know.

37:50.435 --> 37:51.436
Lorelai.

37:52.353 --> 37:55.690
Jason Stiles,
as I live and breathe.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.443
You look like the hottest Italian widow
I have ever seen.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.862
It's nice that you came.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.656
Your father was a lion.
You know that.

38:03.739 --> 38:06.076
I do.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.994
I'm deeply sorry.

38:08.578 --> 38:11.831
At least it was sudden.
Mom didn't have to watch him fade away.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.084
Have you seen my mother by the way?

38:14.167 --> 38:18.296
I've been successfully keeping
a living room's worth of space between us.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.755
She's in hostess mode.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.508
At worst, she'll send you home
with shrimp.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.260
-To which I'm allergic.
-Thus fulfilling her devious plan.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.931
- You happy?
- Right now or...

38:30.183 --> 38:31.184
Are you happy?

38:32.894 --> 38:33.812
Yes.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.564
Umlauts.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.691
Digger.

38:46.825 --> 38:47.993
What you doin'?

38:48.076 --> 38:50.370
Oh, there was a screw loose
in the heating vent.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.955
I didn't want it to fall out.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.165
Uh-huh.
Did you service the boiler yet?

38:54.249 --> 38:56.376
It was just the one screw.
That's it.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.627
Garbage disposal working now?

38:57.710 --> 39:00.839
I just saw it like that
and I had this with me so...

39:00.922 --> 39:02.298
-And the rain gutters?
-Well...

39:02.382 --> 39:07.220
You can't leave them clogged like that.
The water gets in the house.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.848
I can't help it.
Funerals make me nervous.

39:09.931 --> 39:10.974
Here.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.475
This is such a big house

39:12.558 --> 39:13.643
and things go wrong all the time.

39:13.726 --> 39:15.395
But I could have
my husband fix everything.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.438
And we could move in here with you
so you would not be so alone

39:17.522 --> 39:19.149
and we can take care of everything.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.525
- Everything.
- Sure.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.152
You will like my husband.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.319
He's very tall and quiet.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.820
- Okay?
- Sure.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.781
Oh, <i>Señora</i> Gilmore, don't worry.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.785
Fine. Just take that to the kitchen?

39:31.744 --> 39:34.205
-What language is that?
-I do not know.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.290
I thought it was Spanish,

39:35.373 --> 39:37.959
but I had the gardener
tell her to come in early one day

39:38.043 --> 39:40.336
and he told me
she wasn't speaking Spanish,

39:40.420 --> 39:41.837
It took me a while to understand

39:41.922 --> 39:44.883
because I need the pool man
to translate for the gardener.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.760
-Hey, time to get going, kid.
-Oh, shoot!

39:47.843 --> 39:49.595
I have to get to the airport!

39:49.679 --> 39:51.472
My goodness, so dramatic.

39:51.556 --> 39:54.017
Please tell your daughter
I'm going to be fine.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.729
-The two of you can just run along.
-Oh, no. I'm gonna have Luke drive her.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.065
-You're staying?
-Yeah.

40:00.648 --> 40:01.858
All right.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.526
Grandma...

40:03.609 --> 40:05.236
You made him very proud.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.906
I will call you when I get to London.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.908
Emily, everything's in good shape here.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.451
-I'm sorry?
-Just send her your bill.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.328
Right. So...

40:14.745 --> 40:17.457
Thank you, Luke.
Drive safe now.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.749
Okay, love you.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.710
Ditto. Bye, guys.

40:24.047 --> 40:25.924
So... scotch?

40:26.882 --> 40:27.883
God, yes.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.921
One of his favorites.

41:06.006 --> 41:08.091
A classic for a classic.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.342
Hear, hear.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.556
Well, I know it's getting late

41:15.640 --> 41:18.184
and I know some of you have
a very long ride home.

41:19.102 --> 41:22.689
I want to thank you for your friendship
and for being here.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.525
Richard loved you all very much.

41:26.484 --> 41:29.070
But before we all go our separate ways,

41:29.154 --> 41:32.698
I thought we could go around
and everyone could stand up

41:32.782 --> 41:35.285
and tell a favorite story about Richard.

41:36.911 --> 41:37.953
What did she just say?

41:38.038 --> 41:40.665
I know there are hundreds
to choose from.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.918
But too bad,
I'm going to limit you to just one.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.336
The best one.

41:45.420 --> 41:49.298
The one that most sums up
the Richard Gilmore you know and love.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.467
Let's start here. Jack?

41:53.761 --> 41:57.723
Well, Richard and I go back, um, to Yale.

41:57.807 --> 42:01.061
-We both went there...
-Excuse me. Please switch places with me.

42:01.144 --> 42:02.562
-What?
-There's a draft.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.273
-We're outside.
-Yeah, don't wanna go next.

42:05.356 --> 42:10.528
So, I decide to sneak a pair
of black lacy women's unmentionables

42:10.611 --> 42:12.655
into his locker for everyone to see.

42:12.738 --> 42:15.200
And so, one day after polo practice,

42:15.283 --> 42:18.869
I'm at the locker and I'm trying
to pick the lock so that I can leave

42:18.953 --> 42:21.331
the unmentionables there, and suddenly,

42:21.414 --> 42:25.460
I look up and I see him standing there
across the way at my locker

42:25.543 --> 42:29.297
also holding a pair
of black lacy knickers.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.967
And he sees me and we look at each other

42:33.051 --> 42:35.386
holding these women's underpants.

42:35.470 --> 42:36.971
So finally, Richard says,

42:37.055 --> 42:41.517
"Well, we can't possibly
both be in black."

42:45.813 --> 42:46.856
Wonderful.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.441
Franklin?

42:50.776 --> 42:53.571
He cheated at cards.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.325
Only with you, Franklin.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.703
One day, I'd just got myself
a brand new Jaguar.

43:00.786 --> 43:04.082
Richard said, "Let's play for pinks."

43:04.165 --> 43:05.625
So I say, "Now, look here, Gilmore.

43:05.708 --> 43:09.295
You keep your hands off my new car."

43:09.379 --> 43:11.797
And he smiles and says, "Make me."

43:13.216 --> 43:14.592
And next we have--

43:14.675 --> 43:16.677
Oh, looks like Martin's asleep.

43:16.761 --> 43:17.803
Lorelai?

43:19.347 --> 43:21.516
-What?
-You're up.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.058
No. No, no.

43:23.143 --> 43:24.769
Let's... let's...

43:24.852 --> 43:27.688
We can wake Martin up, huh?

43:27.772 --> 43:31.192
Hey, Marty. Marty.
Babe Paley's in the corner.

43:31.276 --> 43:32.443
- Lorelai.
- Hmm?

43:33.027 --> 43:34.028
Just go.

43:35.238 --> 43:37.615
Uh... uh...

43:38.574 --> 43:41.827
The best story... best story.

43:41.911 --> 43:44.539
There's so many great--
No... no one else wants to go?

43:45.290 --> 43:48.042
Nope? They don't because it's my turn.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.835
So, um, okay...

43:49.919 --> 43:53.798
I'm ten, and I ask Dad if...

43:53.881 --> 43:58.052
to play hide and seek,
and I went and hid in his steamer trunk,

43:58.136 --> 44:00.012
and he left and went to Holland.

44:02.265 --> 44:04.308
I'm sorry. No, it was Belgium.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.353
Or... oh, uh, I'm 15,

44:07.437 --> 44:12.107
and we were having our,
um, Gilmore Fourth of July party

44:12.192 --> 44:14.652
and Dad was dressed as Paul Revere.

44:14.735 --> 44:18.906
And I guess I was supposed
to be, um, greeting people

44:18.989 --> 44:20.616
or playing the flute with a peg leg,

44:20.700 --> 44:24.119
so he came looking for me
and he burst into the pool house

44:24.204 --> 44:27.998
where I was on the couch
with Teddy Wiedemier III,

44:28.082 --> 44:31.544
and we had just finished, uh...

44:31.627 --> 44:34.630
"The British are coming!
The British are--" Anyhow, you get it.

44:34.714 --> 44:38.343
Dad's livid and he's yelling, "Emily,
our daughter's losing her virginity

44:38.426 --> 44:40.553
five feet away
from the president of J.P. Morgan,"

44:40.636 --> 44:42.305
which was embarrassing and not true,

44:42.388 --> 44:44.599
because that ship had sailed
a long time ago,

44:44.682 --> 44:47.142
like <i>Niña, Pinta, Santa Maria</i> time ago,

44:47.227 --> 44:48.686
if you know what I mean.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.231
So...

44:52.982 --> 44:56.611
Oh, I'm sorry, it was not Belgium.
It was Croatia.

45:10.791 --> 45:12.793
It was wonderful
seeing you again.

45:12.877 --> 45:15.255
We should get together next month maybe.
Can we?

45:15.338 --> 45:16.464
I'd love to.

45:16.547 --> 45:18.924
All right now,
you all drive carefully.

45:19.008 --> 45:20.009
Thank you so much.

45:20.968 --> 45:23.220
- Good night.
- Good night.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.529
I'm sorry.

45:46.452 --> 45:47.995
You took me by surprise.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.163
Not another word.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.251
It was late and there was scotch.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.086
Lorelai, stop talking.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.593
I didn't mean to--

46:03.428 --> 46:04.512
Don't follow.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.561
Mom...

46:13.562 --> 46:14.605
Mom...

46:16.607 --> 46:18.067
Please, come back.

46:18.150 --> 46:21.487
I didn't do it on purpose.
I had a brain freeze. I panicked.

46:21.570 --> 46:22.488
Mom.

46:23.113 --> 46:26.826
- You two start with the silver.
- I didn't know there'd be a... test.

46:26.909 --> 46:28.411
A test?

46:28.494 --> 46:30.162
-Yes.
-You didn't know there'd be a test?

46:30.245 --> 46:33.040
-Is that what you said to me?
-I also said I'm sorry.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.124
-Did you?
-Yes.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.292
-Did you?
-Yes.

46:35.376 --> 46:37.753
-Did you really?
-You're making me doubt it now--

46:37.837 --> 46:39.296
I asked you for a story.

46:39.380 --> 46:42.717
"Oh, there was a time when Dad
bought me a doll. I loved this doll."

46:42.800 --> 46:45.886
Something like that.
Get out! Now!

46:46.846 --> 46:50.558
-"I remember when he took me to the park."
-He didn't take me to a park.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.142
-The zoo.
-That either.

46:52.226 --> 46:55.563
The store! The club! Kathmandu!
I don't give a damn where he took you.

46:55.646 --> 46:58.941
All I wanted was a fond anecdote
from his only daughter

46:59.024 --> 47:03.404
and what I got was a rambling diatribe
on being abandoned in a steamer trunk.

47:03.488 --> 47:05.906
You have nothing
but contempt for this family.

47:05.990 --> 47:06.866
That is not true.

47:06.949 --> 47:09.494
What did we do
to fill you with such contempt?

47:09.577 --> 47:12.538
Love you? Support you?
Love Rory? Support Rory?

47:12.622 --> 47:14.206
I'm not filled with contempt.

47:14.289 --> 47:17.001
All my other friends have children
who worship them,

47:17.084 --> 47:18.544
who call them every day,

47:18.628 --> 47:21.005
who take pride in the family name
and traditions.

47:21.088 --> 47:22.089
I have pride.

47:22.172 --> 47:25.009
Your father was a great man.

47:25.092 --> 47:26.386
A pillar of the community.

47:26.469 --> 47:28.763
- A man amongst men.
- I know.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.348
And you dishonor him today
like this in his own house.

47:31.432 --> 47:33.058
I didn't mean to dishonor him.

47:33.142 --> 47:35.310
What did you mean to do?
Break my heart in public?

47:35.395 --> 47:37.980
-No fun doing it in private anymore?
-Mom.

47:38.064 --> 47:42.610
I know that you are in massive pain.
Believe it or not, I'm in pain, too.

47:42.693 --> 47:46.155
I'm tired and my head is spinning,
and I haven't eaten in two days.

47:46.238 --> 47:48.323
-You? Not eaten? Please.
-Yes, me!

47:48.408 --> 47:51.160
I'm surprised you didn't have
a pizza delivered during "Ave Maria."

47:51.243 --> 47:54.664
Well, I haven't eaten and I drank
my weight in single malt scotch.

47:54.747 --> 47:56.665
I screwed up. I made a mistake.

47:56.749 --> 47:58.543
That was premeditated.

47:58.626 --> 48:01.629
How could it be premeditated
if I didn't know it was coming?

48:01.712 --> 48:05.340
You never do anything unless
it's what you want to do. You never have.

48:05.424 --> 48:08.094
You blow through life
like a natural disaster,

48:08.177 --> 48:10.513
knocking down everything
and everyone in your path.

48:10.596 --> 48:13.474
-Did Luke know what he was getting into?
-Don't.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.017
Did you ever ask him what he wanted?

48:15.100 --> 48:17.687
Where he wanted to live?
If he wanted children?

48:17.770 --> 48:19.814
I'm sure that didn't matter
to Lorelai Gilmore.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.567
Nothing matters to her
except what she wants and feels.

48:22.650 --> 48:25.402
God help you
if she thinks you've wronged her.

48:25.486 --> 48:29.364
She will hold onto that grudge forever
waiting to get back at you.

48:29.448 --> 48:34.453
I made a mistake! A goddamn mistake!
You've never let me make a mistake ever.

48:34.537 --> 48:37.623
Not once in my life, which is how
we always find ourselves here.

48:37.707 --> 48:39.917
-Where?
-Standing in the middle of this room

48:40.000 --> 48:41.502
yelling at each other like idiots!

48:41.586 --> 48:45.047
How dare you call me an idiot!
I just lost my husband!

48:45.130 --> 48:47.007
I just lost my father!

48:47.091 --> 48:48.551
And you couldn't care less!

48:48.634 --> 48:51.220
That's horrible.

48:52.888 --> 48:54.139
You're horrible.

48:54.223 --> 48:55.349
Get out!

48:55.933 --> 48:58.519
First the help, then me.
Seems about right.

48:58.603 --> 48:59.812
Go home!

48:59.895 --> 49:02.940
Go back to your beloved town
with its carnies and misfits.

49:03.023 --> 49:06.610
Tell them how your intolerable mother
yelled at you at your father's funeral.

49:06.694 --> 49:09.614
They can all console you
and tell you what a witch I am

49:09.697 --> 49:11.031
and how perfect you are!

49:13.033 --> 49:15.703
Full freakin' circle.

49:20.916 --> 49:23.294
You couldn't have just said
he was well-read?

49:23.586 --> 49:26.839
- I know.
- "My father. Boy, did he love books."

49:26.922 --> 49:28.257
I know, I know.

49:28.340 --> 49:30.718
"And stamps.
Whoo, that stamp collection."

49:30.801 --> 49:32.845
I was under a lot of pressure.
You weren't there.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.097
And how did you neglect to tell me this?

49:35.180 --> 49:37.767
-Oh, I didn't think she was mad anymore.
-You didn't?

49:37.850 --> 49:40.603
Well, I assumed she was,
because she hadn't answered

49:40.686 --> 49:43.523
any of my calls or e-mails
for the last four months,

49:43.606 --> 49:45.525
but I thought she'd hide it
in front of you.

49:45.608 --> 49:47.276
Because that's ever happened.

49:50.529 --> 49:53.491
What could possibly elicit
that kind of smile in this house?

49:54.492 --> 49:56.035
It smells meaty.

49:56.118 --> 49:57.787
Yes, but what kind of meat?

49:57.870 --> 49:59.955
And there's cheese, and layers of...

50:00.873 --> 50:02.625
-It's crunchy.
-Huh.

50:02.708 --> 50:05.795
No, wait, it's smooshy.
It's crunchy and smooshy.

50:05.878 --> 50:09.549
-What's crunchy and smooshy?
-Peanut butter? Or badly mixed cement?

50:09.632 --> 50:13.093
So we've got meat, cheese, peanut butter
or badly mixed cement.

50:13.177 --> 50:14.762
For God's sake, just eat it.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.056
I'll tell you what, I'll dive in first.

50:17.139 --> 50:20.184
Mom always made me taste her food
before she'd eat a bite.

50:22.603 --> 50:25.981
Mmm. Delicious.
And it could be peanut butter.

50:26.065 --> 50:27.692
-Oh, yeah.
-Cool.

50:27.775 --> 50:30.820
I appreciate you inviting me to dinner.
It was harrowing out there.

50:31.403 --> 50:32.321
Who is this?

50:32.404 --> 50:34.574
Kirk, your car broke down
at the end of the driveway.

50:34.657 --> 50:37.034
It's lucky for me I'm a very loud crier.

50:37.117 --> 50:40.329
If your maid hadn't heard my sobs,
I don't know what would've happened.

50:40.412 --> 50:43.541
-You would've run out of Kleenex.
-It's nice we can joke about it now.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.293
Thanks for letting me stash
some boxes here, Grandma.

50:46.377 --> 50:49.338
-Where are you going to live?
-I'll get my own place again, eventually.

50:49.421 --> 50:51.924
For now she's Jack Kerouac.
She's <i>On the Road</i>-ing it.

50:52.007 --> 50:53.008
Pass the peyote.

50:53.092 --> 50:57.054
But after you've passed the peyote,
what bathroom will you use to throw up in?

50:57.137 --> 51:00.683
Well, I have many options.
Paris lets me stay with her in New York.

51:00.766 --> 51:03.518
-Or I can stay with Mom, Lane or you.
-So you're homeless.

51:03.603 --> 51:05.187
I am not homeless.

51:05.270 --> 51:07.439
-But you don't live anyplace.
-Just for now.

51:07.522 --> 51:10.025
You're okay with this
vagabond existence she's leading?

51:10.109 --> 51:11.611
Like... like a groupie?

51:11.694 --> 51:13.988
I wish she was a groupie.
I'd get better tickets to stuff.

51:14.071 --> 51:17.199
-Luke! Buddy!
-Hey, everybody. Emily.

51:17.282 --> 51:19.159
-Careful!
-Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

51:19.243 --> 51:20.828
-No, I'll do that.
-Oh, sure.

51:20.911 --> 51:21.996
Thanks for coming.

51:22.079 --> 51:25.415
Yes. Saved us all
a very expensive cab ride.

51:25.499 --> 51:27.752
Are you all leaving now?
We all just sat down.

51:27.835 --> 51:31.005
Oh, no, please. Just eat.
Um, no rush. I can just, uh...

51:31.922 --> 51:33.716
- Buh-buh-buh!
- Oh...

51:36.093 --> 51:37.762
This really is delicious.

51:38.971 --> 51:41.849
Oh, thank you.

51:41.932 --> 51:42.933
You don't like it?

51:43.017 --> 51:46.145
What? Oh, uh... Okay.

51:47.229 --> 51:48.272
Very good.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.691
Isn't it? I could eat here every night.

51:52.401 --> 51:53.903
-Luke?
-Hmm, yes?

51:53.986 --> 51:56.196
What do you think about
Rory's living situation?

51:56.280 --> 51:57.865
-Um...
-Her traipsing around

51:57.948 --> 52:00.617
from one couch to another
like she's Llewyn Davis.

52:00.701 --> 52:01.702
Oh, it's fine.

52:02.494 --> 52:06.999
Well, I mean... you know,
she's grown, and she's...

52:07.499 --> 52:11.170
Uh, did you read her <i>New Yorker</i> piece
that she wrote? I put it on the menu.

52:11.253 --> 52:14.423
Why is everyone treating this
like it's a normal rite of passage?

52:14.506 --> 52:18.803
Rory is a 32-year-old college-educated
woman with no permanent address.

52:18.886 --> 52:19.929
That's not normal.

52:20.012 --> 52:22.264
Um, can I be excused?

52:22.347 --> 52:24.975
They're playing soccer
and they seem to be short a man.

52:25.059 --> 52:26.185
Go.

52:28.688 --> 52:30.647
Hi, I'm Kirk! Over here!

52:31.606 --> 52:33.442
Explain to me again who that person is?

52:33.525 --> 52:36.611
-Oh, that I could.
-Grandma, don't worry about me.

52:36.696 --> 52:39.949
I know exactly what I'm doing.
I'm busier than I've ever been.

52:40.032 --> 52:41.366
I'm traveling and pursuing a goal.

52:41.450 --> 52:44.286
I don't have to store my stuff here
if you're going to worry.

52:44.369 --> 52:47.206
You can leave your things here.
That's not what I meant.

52:48.123 --> 52:50.417
-There's a chair now.
-Oh, sure.

52:55.005 --> 52:58.133
Goal!

53:03.555 --> 53:04.890
Call me from London.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.017
-Luke.
-Yes?

53:07.101 --> 53:10.104
-That was just my way of saying goodbye.
-Oh, goodbye.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.689
-Good night, Mom.
-Kirk, we're leaving!

53:12.773 --> 53:14.191
-Talk tomorrow.
-Yep.

53:17.277 --> 53:18.653
Kirk! Now!

53:34.461 --> 53:36.421
-Thank you, Luke.
-Oh, you're welcome, Kirk.

53:36.505 --> 53:40.217
Before I go, we should get our stories
straight about what happened.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.595
Your car broke down, I drove to Hartford,
and drove you back home.

53:43.678 --> 53:46.390
Or you broke down, I drove to Hartford
and picked you up,

53:46.473 --> 53:47.516
and drove you back home.

53:47.599 --> 53:48.768
-What?
-Much better story.

53:48.851 --> 53:49.894
No.

53:49.977 --> 53:53.480
My business is young, Luke.
There's kinks to work out.

53:53.563 --> 53:55.983
People don't want to know
how the sausage gets made.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.067
They just want to eat.

53:57.151 --> 53:59.694
There's no arguing
or even responding to that, Kirk.

53:59.779 --> 54:01.405
Great. Thank you.

54:01.488 --> 54:03.115
Damn it.

54:03.198 --> 54:04.992
Petal, stop right now!

54:05.075 --> 54:07.702
I know you hear me!
I know you hear me!

54:07.787 --> 54:10.747
You get back here!
Curb right! Curb right!

54:10.831 --> 54:12.958
- Go, Petal!
- Don't encourage her.

54:16.420 --> 54:18.088
-What's all this?
-What?

54:18.172 --> 54:22.509
Dictionary, thesaurus, <i>Mathematical</i>
<i>Principles of Natural Philosophy...</i>

54:22.592 --> 54:24.344
Aw, you got a letter from April.

54:24.428 --> 54:27.389
I was two hours into deciphering it
when I got your call.

54:27.472 --> 54:28.515
"Hello, <i>Pater--"</i>

54:28.598 --> 54:30.559
-"Father," British or Latin.
-Sure.

54:30.642 --> 54:32.602
She used the word "ontological"
three times.

54:32.686 --> 54:34.814
She used it last time.
I looked it up and forgot it.

54:34.897 --> 54:36.565
I was looking it up again when you called.

54:36.648 --> 54:39.359
That's what you get when you spawn
an MIT-going genius.

54:39.443 --> 54:42.112
Rory's smart. She speaks
like she doesn't need subtitles.

54:42.196 --> 54:43.447
But she grew up with me.

54:43.530 --> 54:46.241
She learned her language skills
via <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

54:46.909 --> 54:48.702
-Hey, how old is this coffee?
-Old.

54:48.785 --> 54:49.786
Oh, well.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.414
-Hey, Luke--
-What are you doing?

54:52.497 --> 54:55.167
-Eating sprinkles.
-Wait, but... Never mind.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.085
Uh, did I tell you?

54:57.336 --> 54:59.379
Michel's husband Frederick wants a baby.

54:59.463 --> 55:02.925
Frederick, the guy who ordered
three pancakes on three separate plates?

55:03.008 --> 55:05.010
The town ought to buy another pig.

55:05.093 --> 55:07.179
I can't watch this anymore.

55:07.847 --> 55:10.390
Hey, Luke...
did you ever want a kid?

55:11.308 --> 55:13.936
-I have a kid.
-I mean a fresh kid.

55:14.019 --> 55:16.396
What the hell is a fresh kid?

55:16.480 --> 55:19.107
A kid that's fresh. A kid with me.

55:20.234 --> 55:23.070
We never had a serious conversation
about it, I don't think.

55:23.153 --> 55:25.030
That moment at the Twickham house,
but since then...

55:25.114 --> 55:29.118
I figured if you wanted another kid
you would say something.

55:29.201 --> 55:31.495
I figured if you wanted another kid,
you'd say something.

55:31.578 --> 55:32.872
-I brought it up once.
-When?

55:32.955 --> 55:34.539
-Five, six years ago.
-I don't remember.

55:34.623 --> 55:35.665
At the little league game.

55:35.749 --> 55:39.253
The kid playing right field
walked off mid-inning to use the bathroom.

55:39.336 --> 55:41.547
I turned to you and I said,
"That's the kid."

55:42.381 --> 55:44.383
-"That's the kid"?
-Yes.

55:44.466 --> 55:46.635
"That's the kid" is how you say
you want to have a kid?

55:46.718 --> 55:47.636
In so many words.

55:47.719 --> 55:49.930
No, that is not you saying
you want to have a kid.

55:50.014 --> 55:53.017
"That's the kid" is acknowledging the kid
about whom you said,

55:53.100 --> 55:55.519
-"That's the kid."
-I thought you knew what I meant.

55:55.602 --> 55:57.646
Impossible, because I don't speak "huh"?

55:57.729 --> 56:01.025
Well... that's what I thought
and you didn't pursue it, so...

56:01.108 --> 56:02.484
-It was up to me to pursue it?
-No.

56:02.568 --> 56:04.152
Sorry, I...

56:05.905 --> 56:07.781
Well, how do you feel about it now?

56:07.864 --> 56:09.658
What?

56:09.741 --> 56:11.035
Do you still want a kid?

56:11.118 --> 56:14.163
Oh, well, I mean... I mean, isn't it,
uh, too late?

56:14.246 --> 56:16.331
-I don't know.
-Look, forget it.

56:16.415 --> 56:18.083
I have kids. I have April

56:18.167 --> 56:21.753
and I've always considered Rory
to be a little bit mine, so...

56:21.837 --> 56:25.674
Yeah, but she was so much fun to raise.
Don't you want to have that kind of fun?

56:25.757 --> 56:28.552
I have fun. Look at all the chairs
I get to put on tables.

56:28.635 --> 56:30.845
You don't wanna toss a ball around
with your son?

56:30.930 --> 56:33.265
-There's Jess.
-I said toss a ball "with" not "at."

56:33.348 --> 56:34.766
I'm fine.

56:34.850 --> 56:37.603
-You'll never see your kid's graduation.
-I went to Rory's graduation.

56:38.979 --> 56:41.565
-It's not the same.
-I know it's not the same.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.776
I don't want you to miss out on anything.

56:44.859 --> 56:47.279
Nobody gets to have everything
they want in life.

56:47.362 --> 56:49.698
All in all, I think I did pretty good.

56:56.956 --> 56:58.373
<i>Okay, Sandy, see you then.</i>

56:58.457 --> 57:00.417
- <i>Who's Sandy?</i>
<i>- Do you have to know everything?</i>

57:00.500 --> 57:03.212
<i>I'm your best friend</i>
<i>and business partner, so yes.</i>

57:03.295 --> 57:04.879
<i>Sandy is our surrogate.</i>

57:04.963 --> 57:06.757
- <i>You're doing it.</i>
<i>- We're thinking about it.</i>

57:06.840 --> 57:07.882
<i>Exciting!</i>

57:07.967 --> 57:11.553
<i>I just hope it works.</i>
<i>A baby would really help everything.</i>

57:11.637 --> 57:14.097
- <i>We want cake!</i>
<i>- Coming. Take it.</i>

57:14.181 --> 57:15.724
<i>Who's gonna help me</i>
<i>light the candles?</i>

57:15.807 --> 57:17.851
- <i>I will, I will!</i>
<i>- Fun, fun, fun!</i>

57:26.568 --> 57:28.487
Here you go. Freshly made.

57:28.570 --> 57:31.281
Thanks. It's been at least an hour
since my last infusion.

57:31.365 --> 57:34.701
So, I have all your paperwork.
I'll make sure everything's in order.

57:34.784 --> 57:37.329
-You can flip through this while you wait.
-Thanks.

57:42.542 --> 57:43.585
Really good coffee.

57:43.668 --> 57:45.879
-Is it?
-Yep. Strong. A little crunchy.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.131
Good. Good.

57:48.465 --> 57:51.093
Okay, I will take a look.

57:56.348 --> 57:58.767
-You're supposed to be looking with me.
-Sorry.

57:58.850 --> 58:00.935
So, what are we looking at here?

58:01.020 --> 58:02.937
-Potential surrogates.
-Surrogates. Yes.

58:03.022 --> 58:04.939
And these surrogates will...

58:05.024 --> 58:06.691
-Carry the baby.
-Our baby.

58:06.775 --> 58:09.152
-Yes. They'll carry our baby.
- I'm confused.

58:09.236 --> 58:11.530
Am I supposed to be having sex
with these women?

58:11.613 --> 58:13.740
-What?
-I don't wanna have sex with her.

58:13.823 --> 58:16.076
No, you're not having sex
with these women.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.287
-What? You'd have sex with her?
-No.

58:18.370 --> 58:20.330
-How about her?
-No.

58:20.414 --> 58:21.456
She's holding a bat.

58:21.540 --> 58:23.583
You could play softball
and do it in the dugout.

58:23.667 --> 58:26.170
I don't want to have sex with her
or any of these women.

58:26.253 --> 58:28.463
I don't want to have sex with anyone ever.

58:28.547 --> 58:31.050
- Except me.
- Lorelai, why are we here?

58:31.133 --> 58:33.010
I tried to broach the subject of adoption.

58:33.093 --> 58:34.844
I don't want to go to Bangladesh
to get a baby.

58:34.928 --> 58:36.721
I don't want to go to Woodbury
to get a light bulb.

58:36.805 --> 58:38.765
If you won't adopt,
this may be our only option,

58:38.848 --> 58:41.726
- and I don't want another picture window.
- What?

58:41.810 --> 58:44.354
When we remodeled the house,
you wanted a picture window,

58:44.438 --> 58:48.442
but it looked weird with the other windows
and so you gave it up. You settled.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.860
I do not remember
wanting a picture window.

58:50.944 --> 58:53.488
Well, you did.
Now it's another thing on the list of

58:53.572 --> 58:55.574
"things I don't have
because I'm with Lorelai."

58:55.657 --> 58:57.867
-Like peace.
-And a picture window.

58:57.951 --> 59:00.495
I do not want a picture window.

59:00.579 --> 59:04.041
Moron!
When I say "a VIP," I mean a VIP.

59:04.124 --> 59:05.292
I got them coffee.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.711
If we were Starbucks,
you'd be employee of the month.

59:07.794 --> 59:11.339
Since we're not, you're just
the first Smith grad I've fired this week.

59:11.923 --> 59:15.469
Lorelai! So great to see you!
I am so sorry for the wait.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.887
-Paris, that's fine.
-Don't stand there shaking. Just go.

59:17.971 --> 59:19.181
Apologize to your parents.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.766
Tell them you'll pay them back
for the semesters you studied

59:21.850 --> 59:24.561
<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer's</i> effect
on the feminist agenda.

59:24.644 --> 59:27.397
-Okay, so, hello, Luke.
-Hi.

59:27.481 --> 59:29.358
-You remember me.
-You're hard to forget.

59:29.441 --> 59:31.318
Flattering. Let's go.

59:32.444 --> 59:36.490
Now, I rarely act
as a case personal liaison anymore,

59:36.573 --> 59:38.617
but when I heard it was you coming in,
I said,

59:38.700 --> 59:41.161
"That woman was practically
my second mother.

59:41.245 --> 59:43.080
No one else is handling this case."

59:43.163 --> 59:45.749
Aw, that's very sweet of you, Paris.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.418
So, the spiel. Dynasty Makers.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.920
We are the largest full-service fertility

59:51.004 --> 59:53.006
and surrogacy clinic
in the Western Hemisphere.

59:53.090 --> 59:56.468
No other company offers more services,
medical and legal,

59:56.551 --> 59:59.138
and no company has
a higher approval rating.

59:59.221 --> 1:00:00.347
Did you check Yelp?

1:00:00.430 --> 1:00:01.848
-No.
-Check Yelp.

1:00:01.931 --> 1:00:03.850
-Oh.
-So, you know how this works?

1:00:03.933 --> 1:00:06.603
Uh, we look through there and pick?

1:00:06.686 --> 1:00:09.148
Give me that.
Bargain-basement breeders.

1:00:09.231 --> 1:00:13.318
I'm not letting any of those
bottle-service bimbos carry your baby.

1:00:13.402 --> 1:00:16.488
No, for you I pull out the prime meat.

1:00:18.865 --> 1:00:20.283
Am I blacking out?

1:00:20.367 --> 1:00:22.076
How's Rory?
She back from London?

1:00:22.161 --> 1:00:23.662
She was, but she's there now.

1:00:23.745 --> 1:00:25.705
-Hard to keep track of our girl, huh?
-Yeah.

1:00:25.789 --> 1:00:29.251
Okay. So, it's pretty cut and dry here.

1:00:29.334 --> 1:00:32.921
We plant an egg in a viable body,
we fertilize it and out comes a baby.

1:00:33.004 --> 1:00:35.215
Bing bang boom.
Have you thought about eggs?

1:00:35.299 --> 1:00:38.343
-Uh...
-Using eggs over age 44 with IVF,

1:00:38.427 --> 1:00:41.596
the chances of having a baby
is about 1% per try.

1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:44.349
-Wow, super fun fact.
-She keep you in stitches, this one?

1:00:44.433 --> 1:00:47.060
Oh, yeah.
Hey, how much is this gonna cost?

1:00:47.144 --> 1:00:50.147
A lot. But, again, Lorelai's
the only mother I ever had,

1:00:50.230 --> 1:00:53.650
except for Nanny Soledad,
so there's mondo discounts involved.

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:55.694
How much time
did you spend with this girl?

1:00:55.777 --> 1:00:57.154
-So, Luke.
-Yeah.

1:00:57.237 --> 1:00:58.322
How are the boys?

1:00:58.405 --> 1:01:00.657
-What? What is she doing?
-I don't know.

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:03.410
I'm good at visually sussing out
the situation down there.

1:01:03.493 --> 1:01:05.036
Please stop sussing.

1:01:05.119 --> 1:01:08.457
From a cursory glance,
you seem symmetrical and well-balanced.

1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:10.209
Make sure he sticks with the boxers.

1:01:10.292 --> 1:01:13.878
Okay, here's a sampling of what we've got.

1:01:13.962 --> 1:01:17.257
Blondes, brunettes and redheads.

1:01:17.341 --> 1:01:20.719
Tall, short, athletic, artsy.

1:01:20.802 --> 1:01:24.348
We even got 'em
with a little extra junk in the trunk,

1:01:24.431 --> 1:01:26.475
if you secretly like 'em that way, Luke.

1:01:26.558 --> 1:01:30.229
I'm sorry. Am I or am I not having sex
with this woman?

1:01:30.312 --> 1:01:31.730
That's a sick thought.

1:01:31.813 --> 1:01:33.940
You're not having sex with her.
She's married.

1:01:34.023 --> 1:01:36.443
-You made it sound like--
-We've got Jews, Christians,

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:39.613
Muslims, Hindus, atheists, one Wiccan,

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:42.324
and for a premium,
you can get the cream of the crop,

1:01:42.407 --> 1:01:44.158
top of the line, army wives.

1:01:44.243 --> 1:01:47.078
Sturdy, reliable, great at packing.

1:01:47.161 --> 1:01:51.040
Oh, wait, sorry.
I have to take her off the available list.

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:54.628
She just conceived.
Very high-profile client.

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:57.005
Let's just call him... Doogie Howser.

1:01:57.088 --> 1:01:58.757
You mean Neil Patrick Harris?

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:00.592
Wow. Little louder, please.

1:02:00.675 --> 1:02:04.304
Okay, so now his cover's blown,
but, yes, it's Neil Patrick Harris.

1:02:04.388 --> 1:02:06.765
-What kind of a cover--
-It's Neil Patrick Harris.

1:02:06.848 --> 1:02:08.475
Did you hear?
It's Neil Patrick Harris.

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:10.602
-I did hear, yes.
-Neil Patrick Harris.

1:02:10.685 --> 1:02:14.231
-You look upset, Luke.
-No. What makes you think I'm upset?

1:02:14.314 --> 1:02:16.483
You're not excited
about Neil Patrick Harris.

1:02:16.566 --> 1:02:20.737
I'm very excited for Neil Patrick Harris
if this is what he wants.

1:02:20.820 --> 1:02:21.946
Is it not what you want?

1:02:22.030 --> 1:02:23.197
-I...
-I understand.

1:02:23.282 --> 1:02:24.574
It's a big decision, having kids.

1:02:24.658 --> 1:02:27.911
There's rewards,
but also constant panic and worry.

1:02:27.994 --> 1:02:30.414
Are they healthy? Does everything work?
Are they smart?

1:02:30.497 --> 1:02:34.251
McDonald's fry stations are filled
with college-educated moderate achievers.

1:02:34.334 --> 1:02:36.085
And then there's the lottery of nature.

1:02:36.169 --> 1:02:37.837
I mean, I said to Neil,

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:40.840
"Are you prepared to have
a really unattractive child

1:02:40.924 --> 1:02:42.426
that would not look good on camera?

1:02:42.509 --> 1:02:44.886
Would you be okay if your child

1:02:44.969 --> 1:02:47.221
was not an actor but an agent?"

1:02:47.306 --> 1:02:49.641
-I need to leave.
-Luke, wait.

1:02:51.851 --> 1:02:54.521
Oh. Sorry, Paris, I--

1:02:54.604 --> 1:02:58.275
Yes. Go. Talk it through.
I'll send you a DVD of my top picks.

1:02:58.358 --> 1:03:00.360
I'll also include a copy of <i>Gone Girl.</i>

1:03:00.443 --> 1:03:02.862
-NPH was great in that.
-Thanks.

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:06.616
No.

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:22.799
Thank you, Francis.

1:03:24.926 --> 1:03:27.220
Oh, sod it, bring the bottle.
We're celebrating.

1:03:29.556 --> 1:03:31.933
I love coming here
because they hate that I do.

1:03:32.016 --> 1:03:34.018
-Really?
-They wouldn't let women in

1:03:34.102 --> 1:03:36.355
until the mid '80s.
It was only supposed to be

1:03:36.438 --> 1:03:40.233
well-behaved wives with tiny feet,
not hellions like myself.

1:03:40.317 --> 1:03:42.569
I helped kick open those doors.

1:03:42.652 --> 1:03:45.322
-Oh, thank you, love.
-My pleasure, Ms. Shropshire.

1:03:46.531 --> 1:03:49.117
So, to us.

1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:51.077
Hellions in arms.

1:03:53.287 --> 1:03:57.417
Mmm. I must tell you,
I've had such amazing feedback

1:03:57.501 --> 1:03:58.752
for the Talk of the Town piece.

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:00.629
Far more than for anything
I've ever written.

1:04:00.712 --> 1:04:02.088
Oh, I doubt that.

1:04:02.171 --> 1:04:04.215
So, the book.

1:04:04.298 --> 1:04:06.217
-Yes.
-I go back and forth,

1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:07.677
back and forth, you know.

1:04:07.761 --> 1:04:09.888
I never really wanted
to write about myself.

1:04:09.971 --> 1:04:13.892
My fields are feminism,
environmentalism, and who am I?

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:20.524
But if I found someone really like-minded
who I could write it with,

1:04:20.607 --> 1:04:24.736
somebody like yourself...
Well, that's intriguing.

1:04:24.819 --> 1:04:26.988
I've never done anything like this before.

1:04:27.071 --> 1:04:29.491
I don't care about that.
I only care that it's honest.

1:04:29.574 --> 1:04:33.453
-I want to be seen as I am, warts and all.
-I'm great with warts.

1:04:33.537 --> 1:04:37.374
Even if I waver,
if I let my vanity in the door,

1:04:37.457 --> 1:04:39.418
you must remain steadfast.

1:04:39.501 --> 1:04:42.253
Francis, what is that?

1:04:42.336 --> 1:04:45.590
Uh, this is the fluke carpaccio
with lime and chilies.

1:04:45.674 --> 1:04:47.050
Is it?

1:04:47.133 --> 1:04:49.678
And who's the genius
who ordered this magnificent dish?

1:04:49.761 --> 1:04:52.013
Uh, Dr. Reynolds over there.

1:04:52.096 --> 1:04:53.723
Hmm...

1:04:53.807 --> 1:04:55.934
Would it be possible
for this particular plate

1:04:56.017 --> 1:04:58.478
to go missing and for you to rush back

1:04:58.562 --> 1:05:00.814
and get another one
for the darling doctor over there?

1:05:00.897 --> 1:05:02.441
Uh, of course, Naomi.

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:08.697
Oh, it's delicious.

1:05:08.780 --> 1:05:11.616
Everything tastes so much better
when it's stolen.

1:05:11.700 --> 1:05:13.618
Mmm, that is good.

1:05:13.702 --> 1:05:16.079
Mmm, so, let's talk time frame.

1:05:16.162 --> 1:05:19.958
I think it'll be about eight weeks
to work up a proposal for the publishers

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:21.668
and supply a sample chapter.

1:05:21.751 --> 1:05:24.421
How much access can you give me?
Interviews are everything.

1:05:24.504 --> 1:05:27.591
Oh, full access, darling.
Follow me everywhere except the loo.

1:05:27.674 --> 1:05:30.176
Actually, the loo's fine, too.

1:05:30.259 --> 1:05:33.304
-Francis, who's that burger for?
-Um, Ms. Kipney.

1:05:33.388 --> 1:05:36.474
Trust me, she won't enjoy it.
Half of it's going to her dog.

1:05:37.976 --> 1:05:41.020
So, um, the only thing left to discuss
is financial stuff.

1:05:41.104 --> 1:05:42.564
The lawyers can do that, right?

1:05:42.647 --> 1:05:45.734
It's 50-50. Split down the middle.
We're in this together. Yes?

1:05:45.817 --> 1:05:47.193
Yes.

1:05:47.276 --> 1:05:48.445
Right.

1:05:48.528 --> 1:05:51.280
Now, keep your eyes peeled for dessert.

1:05:53.407 --> 1:05:57.370
I can't believe it's only two o'clock.
Two o'clock in the afternoon.

1:05:57.454 --> 1:05:59.372
I feel like I've been awake for days.

1:05:59.456 --> 1:06:03.334
It's the jet lag. And the bourbon.
I drank straight bourbon.

1:06:03.418 --> 1:06:05.753
I'm now a midday straight bourbon drinker.

1:06:05.837 --> 1:06:09.591
I'm gonna have to keep up with Naomi
if I'm going to write this book.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:13.720
She drinks as fast as she talks
and she never seems to get tipsy at all.

1:06:13.803 --> 1:06:16.055
She seemed to get smarter
and more coherent.

1:06:16.139 --> 1:06:19.225
Or maybe she just seems smarter
and more coherent.

1:06:19.308 --> 1:06:20.434
This is great, right?

1:06:20.519 --> 1:06:24.188
I mean, now I have something concrete
to talk about at my Condé Nast meeting,

1:06:24.272 --> 1:06:29.235
and she mentioned publishing excerpts
in <i>Vanity Fair,</i> which would be amazing.

1:06:29.318 --> 1:06:32.363
It's not really what I do,
but it's good for now.

1:06:33.281 --> 1:06:35.659
And it's money.
Money is nice.

1:06:35.742 --> 1:06:39.454
Now I have to hang out with her more
to get a handle on the first few chapters

1:06:39.538 --> 1:06:41.706
so we can bid it out and see who wants it.

1:06:41.790 --> 1:06:44.292
That starts in a month,
when she gets back from India.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:47.003
Basically, I had a good day.
How was your day?

1:06:47.086 --> 1:06:49.338
Well, I had my dry cleaning delivered.

1:06:49.422 --> 1:06:50.840
-Oh, I think I win.
-I don't know.

1:06:50.924 --> 1:06:52.425
I really like these pants, so...

1:06:53.885 --> 1:06:55.970
-I'm glad it went well.
-It did.

1:06:56.054 --> 1:06:59.140
-Tonight, I'll take you out to celebrate.
-I'd like that.

1:06:59.223 --> 1:07:02.101
Tomorrow, I'll tell you all I've heard
about Naomi Shropshire.

1:07:02.185 --> 1:07:04.145
I don't care if she's difficult.

1:07:04.228 --> 1:07:06.773
Oh, she's difficult and a little weird.

1:07:06.856 --> 1:07:08.900
Well, I like weird.
I was formed by weird.

1:07:08.983 --> 1:07:11.069
It could be great,
and you deserve that.

1:07:11.152 --> 1:07:13.238
I do. I do deserve that.

1:07:13.321 --> 1:07:15.699
Did I tell you she lost her shoes
at the club?

1:07:15.782 --> 1:07:18.242
-You did not.
-I didn't notice until we were leaving.

1:07:18.326 --> 1:07:21.329
She was walking as if she had shoes on.
I mention it and she said,

1:07:21.412 --> 1:07:24.958
"I left them somewhere."
How do you do that? It's snowing outside.

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:27.085
-See? Weird.
-Weird makes good copy.

1:07:27.168 --> 1:07:30.547
-So does a great writer.
-Those pants did put you in a good mood.

1:07:32.841 --> 1:07:34.050
Do you have to go back to work?

1:07:34.133 --> 1:07:36.260
The pants can't be
the accomplishment of my day.

1:07:36.344 --> 1:07:38.972
Plus, I have competition now.
You're going to be an author.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:41.600
-It's not like I'm John McPhee.
-Yet.

1:07:41.683 --> 1:07:43.852
I'll send the car for you at 8:00.

1:07:43.935 --> 1:07:45.937
-I'm gonna use your desktop, okay?
-All yours.

1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:49.315
-Where are those boxes I sent here?
-The maid stuffed them in the closet.

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:51.359
-I need to look for something.
-Your lucky outfit?

1:07:51.442 --> 1:07:52.526
Do not mock.

1:07:52.611 --> 1:07:54.153
I am not mocking.
It's a great outfit.

1:07:54.237 --> 1:07:56.447
You were wearing it
when I saw you in Hamburg.

1:07:57.824 --> 1:08:00.994
Hey, is there anything in here
that you don't want me to see?

1:08:01.077 --> 1:08:04.288
-Like body parts?
-That would be on the list, sure.

1:08:04.372 --> 1:08:07.876
No, like, uh... other girl's things.

1:08:07.959 --> 1:08:09.586
-All clear.
-Okay.

1:08:09.669 --> 1:08:12.714
Hey... I wouldn't do that.

1:08:13.006 --> 1:08:15.216
Leave things around for you just to...

1:08:15.299 --> 1:08:17.260
-I wasn't accusing--
-I know. I'm just--

1:08:18.344 --> 1:08:22.348
Look, we have an agreement.
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

1:08:22.432 --> 1:08:23.558
We do.

1:08:24.558 --> 1:08:27.145
And when we leave Vegas,
we forget about Vegas

1:08:27.228 --> 1:08:30.106
until we're back in Vegas
and then it's just us in Vegas until...

1:08:30.189 --> 1:08:31.107
Throw me a rope, man.

1:08:33.151 --> 1:08:34.110
I'll see you at 8:00.

1:08:38.156 --> 1:08:40.700
-Your phone.
-What's it say?

1:08:40.784 --> 1:08:42.661
"Paul dinner. Don't forget."

1:08:42.744 --> 1:08:45.079
-Oh, crap.
-That's a lot of exclamation points.

1:08:45.163 --> 1:08:47.331
-I forgot.
-It was the excitement about my pants.

1:08:47.415 --> 1:08:49.667
-Go. Vegas.
-But-- Yes. Vegas.

1:08:51.670 --> 1:08:54.255
I've got to break up
with this guy.

1:09:02.596 --> 1:09:05.642
-Excuse me, your password?
-Wafflehousebutterbob.

1:09:05.725 --> 1:09:07.518
-Cute.
-Isn't it, though?

1:09:07.601 --> 1:09:09.228
Okay, I'm here now.

1:09:09.312 --> 1:09:11.981
Uh-huh. You two, park it over there.

1:09:12.065 --> 1:09:15.943
No, there is no return policy.
What's she going to return? It's a baby.

1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:17.737
I'll call and see if she wants it,

1:09:17.821 --> 1:09:20.448
but last time it was Brad
who put the kibosh on it.

1:09:20.531 --> 1:09:22.075
-Hello, Luke.
-Paris, hey.

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:24.160
Could you bring them a salad, no croutons?

1:09:24.243 --> 1:09:25.954
Don't let them con you into Diet Cokes.

1:09:26.037 --> 1:09:29.415
-I wanted to apologize for the other day.
-No need.

1:09:29.498 --> 1:09:30.709
I've been in this racket for years

1:09:30.792 --> 1:09:33.419
and sometimes I'm a little too
"let's get down to it."

1:09:33.502 --> 1:09:35.797
-Think I may have scared you a bit.
-Not at all.

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:39.342
Look, you just need to know I'm good.

1:09:39.425 --> 1:09:41.469
I'm the Pablo Escobar
of the fertility world.

1:09:41.552 --> 1:09:44.013
I move the best product,
and I would like to help.

1:09:44.097 --> 1:09:45.890
-I appreciate that, but--
-I get it.

1:09:45.974 --> 1:09:48.267
You're a small-town boy.
You get your milk from a cow.

1:09:48.351 --> 1:09:50.603
Actually, everybody gets their milk
from a cow.

1:09:50.687 --> 1:09:53.147
So I thought I'd make it
a little more homey for you.

1:09:53.231 --> 1:09:54.774
Girls, I'd like to you meet Luke Danes.

1:09:54.858 --> 1:09:56.985
Jill and Jane are two of my top breeders.

1:09:57.068 --> 1:09:58.194
Excuse me?

1:09:58.277 --> 1:10:00.363
I thought you could all sit and talk.

1:10:00.446 --> 1:10:03.032
Ask them questions.
Challenge Jill to an arm wrestle.

1:10:03.116 --> 1:10:05.243
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

1:10:10.623 --> 1:10:11.833
Dragonfly Inn.

1:10:11.916 --> 1:10:13.376
Michel, put Lorelai on the phone.

1:10:13.459 --> 1:10:15.503
-Who is calling?
-Michel!

1:10:15.586 --> 1:10:18.297
Oh, Luke.
How nice to hear your siren call.

1:10:18.381 --> 1:10:22.593
Find Lorelai and tell her that there are
two arm-wrestling breeders here

1:10:22.676 --> 1:10:24.888
-and I need her help!
-What?

1:10:26.931 --> 1:10:28.141
Paris?

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:30.351
-Rory, hi!
-What are you doing here?

1:10:30.434 --> 1:10:31.770
-Oh, I'm working.
-Here?

1:10:31.853 --> 1:10:33.354
Wherever there's
an old or defective uterus.

1:10:33.437 --> 1:10:35.774
-I did not hang up, Michel!
-You eating?

1:10:35.857 --> 1:10:38.401
No, I'm just grabbing coffee.
So jet-lagged.

1:10:38.484 --> 1:10:40.987
I'm heading to your place.
Oh, can I crash at your place?

1:10:41.070 --> 1:10:43.322
-Absolutely, you have the key.
-Find her!

1:10:43.406 --> 1:10:45.867
I have to run an errand first.
You wanna come with?

1:10:45.950 --> 1:10:49.787
Sure. Ladies, I'll be back in a few.
Close the deal.

1:10:50.830 --> 1:10:53.582
Excuse me?
I don't think the Wi-Fi is working.

1:10:53.666 --> 1:10:56.210
Capital "B" on "butter."
Yeah, I'm still here, Michel.

1:10:56.294 --> 1:10:58.337
-Luke!
-Not now, Taylor.

1:10:58.421 --> 1:11:00.965
Well, then when?
I have called, I've left messages,

1:11:01.049 --> 1:11:03.259
I even slipped notes
under your door at night.

1:11:03.342 --> 1:11:04.803
Which I turned over to the FBI.

1:11:04.886 --> 1:11:08.597
I know for a fact
that you have had septic tank issues.

1:11:08.681 --> 1:11:11.475
Taylor, do you see
people in here trying to eat?

1:11:11.559 --> 1:11:13.770
I do. And you know
what happens after they eat?

1:11:13.853 --> 1:11:15.897
-Oh, jeez...
-It's still not working.

1:11:15.980 --> 1:11:19.525
Luke, I love this town.
Do you love this town?

1:11:19.608 --> 1:11:20.651
- No.
- Excuse me.

1:11:20.734 --> 1:11:22.736
Could the capital "B" be on "bob,"
not "butter"?

1:11:22.821 --> 1:11:26.074
I think this town
is destined for greatness.

1:11:26.157 --> 1:11:27.784
All the pieces are there.

1:11:27.867 --> 1:11:30.369
It's just a matter
of finding that special something

1:11:30.453 --> 1:11:32.496
-to put it over the top.
-Like a sewer system.

1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:35.124
Yes, because
when you have a sewer system,

1:11:35.208 --> 1:11:38.086
then you're part of something
bigger than yourself.

1:11:38.169 --> 1:11:41.505
-Like the universe, only more hygienic.
-Taylor--

1:11:41.589 --> 1:11:43.632
I'm sorry.
The password is still not working.

1:11:43.716 --> 1:11:47.428
Of course the password's not working!
It's fake!

1:11:47.511 --> 1:11:49.722
He has been giving out fake passwords

1:11:49.806 --> 1:11:52.391
ever since he got Wi-Fi
in this damn place!

1:11:52.475 --> 1:11:54.602
How stupid are you people anyway?

1:11:54.685 --> 1:11:56.479
He doesn't want
to give out his password

1:11:56.562 --> 1:11:59.315
because he doesn't want you here
checking your Facebook,

1:11:59.398 --> 1:12:02.777
or answering your e-mails,
or YouTubing Zoella,

1:12:02.861 --> 1:12:04.737
or whatever the hell it is you're doing.

1:12:04.821 --> 1:12:09.367
This isn't your office. It's a diner!
Go home!

1:12:09.450 --> 1:12:12.203
Pay for Wi-Fi! I do.

1:12:12.286 --> 1:12:14.538
I... can't...

1:12:14.622 --> 1:12:17.083
You know what? Never mind.

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:21.128
I was wrong. You don't deserve
perpetually unclogged toilets.

1:12:29.637 --> 1:12:31.055
Taylor!

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:35.684
Really?

1:12:37.478 --> 1:12:38.897
Now that I've gotten--

1:12:41.941 --> 1:12:43.651
Hell of a week.

1:13:05.839 --> 1:13:07.175
- Hey!
- Crap!

1:13:07.258 --> 1:13:08.467
Come back here!

1:13:08.551 --> 1:13:10.178
Stop it!
What is wrong with you?

1:13:10.261 --> 1:13:12.931
I told you!
My town, my corner!

1:13:13.014 --> 1:13:14.390
But I'm your sister!

1:13:14.473 --> 1:13:16.267
- No proof of that.
- Ask Mom!

1:13:16.350 --> 1:13:18.852
Mom lies!
You better run, little sister!

1:13:18.937 --> 1:13:22.273
It was over the minute
he wanted to do something creative.

1:13:22.356 --> 1:13:24.901
Wow, you and Doyle split.

1:13:24.984 --> 1:13:27.946
He's a screenwriter now.
Have you been to the movies lately?

1:13:28.029 --> 1:13:30.406
-I know.
-Suddenly he's in jeans

1:13:30.489 --> 1:13:34.493
and wearing faded $200 rock T-shirts
with bands on them he's never seen.

1:13:34.577 --> 1:13:37.496
He's flying out to "the coast,"
as if this is not a coast.

1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:40.041
He drinks vodka
because it has less carbs.

1:13:40.124 --> 1:13:44.545
Then he started selling things
and I realized, "This is going to stick."

1:13:44.628 --> 1:13:46.130
I am so sorry.

1:13:46.214 --> 1:13:48.466
It's fine.
I'll kill him in court.

1:13:48.549 --> 1:13:49.592
Sure.

1:13:49.675 --> 1:13:52.261
I'll be using that Def Leppard T-shirt
to clean my windows.

1:13:52.345 --> 1:13:54.805
I've been waiting a half hour!
It's freezing!

1:13:54.888 --> 1:13:58.142
You shouldn't have
four-starred me last time.

1:13:58.226 --> 1:14:00.561
Don't you maybe wanna
try to work it out nicely?

1:14:00.644 --> 1:14:04.190
You guys have kids and you were
a good team at one point.

1:14:04.273 --> 1:14:06.943
That was before Brett Ratner
gave him the keys to his pool house.

1:14:07.026 --> 1:14:11.197
Okay, ladies.
You have arrived.

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:14.742
-Thanks, Kirk.
-You're welcome. Come again.

1:14:14.825 --> 1:14:18.037
-And does Lane have an extension cord?
-I'll see.

1:14:18.955 --> 1:14:20.498
I know you guys were friends,

1:14:20.581 --> 1:14:23.084
but if push came to shove,
and we had to make T-shirts...

1:14:23.167 --> 1:14:25.128
-Team Paris all the way.
-Thanks.

1:14:25.211 --> 1:14:27.755
Can you say he felt you up at a party
for the deposition?

1:14:27.838 --> 1:14:28.672
No.

1:14:28.756 --> 1:14:31.675
You're all I've got.
Our nanny looks like Benicio Del Toro.

1:14:31.759 --> 1:14:32.760
Oh, you're here.

1:14:32.843 --> 1:14:35.263
Remember to call my mom
to rate me!

1:14:39.808 --> 1:14:40.934
Lane, you remember Paris.

1:14:41.019 --> 1:14:42.478
-I do. Hi.
-Hi.

1:14:42.561 --> 1:14:45.564
- Um, do you still need your boxes?
- Yes, definitely.

1:14:46.482 --> 1:14:48.192
Oh, Kirk, come on!

1:14:49.152 --> 1:14:51.612
-I had Zach pull them out for you.
-You're welcome.

1:14:51.695 --> 1:14:53.947
- Thanks, Zach.
- Don't look at me. I'm not me.

1:14:54.032 --> 1:14:56.117
-What are you trying to find?
-My lucky outfit.

1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:58.995
-Is it, like, a cheerleader uniform?
-Yes, exactly like that.

1:14:59.078 --> 1:15:00.329
- Is this your house?
- Yep.

1:15:00.413 --> 1:15:02.290
-Who gets it when you split?
-What?

1:15:02.373 --> 1:15:03.833
- Is he him yet?
- No!

1:15:03.916 --> 1:15:05.543
Rory, are you staying in the spare room?

1:15:05.626 --> 1:15:07.711
-No, it's all yours, Brian.
-Did you get beer?

1:15:07.795 --> 1:15:09.047
There should be some in there.

1:15:09.130 --> 1:15:11.465
-Uh, can I help?
-Um, yeah. Look through this box.

1:15:11.549 --> 1:15:13.384
I'm looking for a red dress, full skirt.

1:15:13.467 --> 1:15:17.096
Okay, red dress, full skirt.
Oh, this is nice. Wear this.

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:18.639
No, it has to be my lucky outfit.

1:15:18.722 --> 1:15:21.809
My Condé Nast meeting is in two days
and I have to find that outfit.

1:15:21.892 --> 1:15:24.061
- Is he him yet?
- No, he's not!

1:15:24.145 --> 1:15:26.397
I didn't ask for this promotion, okay?
Back off.

1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:29.025
There's nothing wrong with
bringing home the bacon.

1:15:29.108 --> 1:15:30.651
Well, it's not in here.

1:15:30.734 --> 1:15:32.903
Okay. I'm me.

1:15:32.986 --> 1:15:35.531
Steve! Kwan! Come in here!

1:15:35.614 --> 1:15:37.658
Help your Aunt Rory find her outfit.

1:15:37.741 --> 1:15:39.243
-Who did your work?
-What?

1:15:39.327 --> 1:15:41.245
-Them. Friedman?
-I...

1:15:41.329 --> 1:15:43.747
-Rasouli? Mendelssohn?
-I just had them.

1:15:43.831 --> 1:15:44.957
Fine. Don't tell me.

1:15:47.543 --> 1:15:48.461
Hey.

1:15:48.544 --> 1:15:50.588
<i>To answer your 43,000</i>
<i>frantic voicemails,</i>

1:15:50.671 --> 1:15:52.548
<i>you do not have anything</i>
<i>at the dry cleaners.</i>

1:15:52.631 --> 1:15:55.509
-Rats.
-Seriously, it was Kopelson, right?

1:15:55.593 --> 1:15:58.262
It wasn't natural.
Your husband's junk isn't symmetrical.

1:15:58.345 --> 1:15:59.722
Wait, what?

1:16:00.598 --> 1:16:03.101
It's not here.
Maybe it's at Grandma's.

1:16:03.184 --> 1:16:04.893
- How was London?
<i>- Great.</i>

1:16:04.977 --> 1:16:07.020
-Where'd you stay?
-With Didi. Same as always.

1:16:07.105 --> 1:16:11.150
I love that you have a friend named Didi.
Makes you sound so Fridays on ABC.

1:16:11.234 --> 1:16:12.651
Have you spoken to Grandma lately?

1:16:12.735 --> 1:16:16.989
- Why?
- It's been quiet regarding the blowup.

1:16:17.073 --> 1:16:18.699
-I've been busy.
<i>-You should call her.</i>

1:16:18.782 --> 1:16:21.034
-De-ice this situation.
<i>-I will.</i>

1:16:21.119 --> 1:16:22.953
-When?
-When it feels right.

1:16:23.036 --> 1:16:25.581
-You are both being stubborn.
-Well, she started it.

1:16:25.664 --> 1:16:28.042
Aren't we supposed to cut her
all sorts of slack right now?

1:16:28.126 --> 1:16:29.377
I mean, she lost her husband.

1:16:29.460 --> 1:16:31.879
Did you ever imagine
there'd be a Grandma without a Grandpa?

1:16:33.089 --> 1:16:35.216
-No.
<i>-Check on her.</i>

1:16:35.299 --> 1:16:36.717
Fine. I'll check on her.

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:39.137
Good. Maybe while you're there,
you can find my outfit.

1:16:39.220 --> 1:16:42.055
Wow, the student surpasses the master.

1:16:43.557 --> 1:16:46.644
- Great.
<i>- What?</i>

1:16:46.727 --> 1:16:48.687
My Condé Nast meeting got pushed again.

1:16:48.771 --> 1:16:52.441
Aw, sorry, hon.
So you don't need that outfit after all?

1:16:52.525 --> 1:16:54.402
You're going.

1:16:56.028 --> 1:16:57.530
-Oh, man.
-What now?

1:16:57.613 --> 1:16:58.947
Poor Paul.

1:16:59.031 --> 1:17:01.825
-Hey, you have got to--
-I know, I know.

1:17:06.455 --> 1:17:08.541
- All right, let's do this.
- Yes!

1:17:08.624 --> 1:17:10.626
So, are they serious?

1:17:10.709 --> 1:17:11.835
One, two!

1:18:23.991 --> 1:18:26.619
-Mom?
<i>-Hola,</i> hello.

1:18:37.713 --> 1:18:38.881
Mom!

1:18:43.636 --> 1:18:45.554
Take that box
and put it downstairs.

1:18:45.638 --> 1:18:47.556
Come back up here
and get these presents.

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:50.976
-Mom, are you here?
-Lorelai? I didn't know you were coming.

1:18:51.059 --> 1:18:52.853
Holy shit!

1:18:52.936 --> 1:18:55.939
Berta, these boxes need to go outside.

1:18:56.023 --> 1:18:58.025
- What? What? What?
- They go outside.

1:18:58.108 --> 1:19:00.361
Take the boxes. Oh, good.

1:19:00.444 --> 1:19:02.070
- Did you call?
- Did I?

1:19:02.154 --> 1:19:03.947
Because today is a very bad day.

1:19:04.031 --> 1:19:06.158
What is going on?
Who are all these people?

1:19:06.242 --> 1:19:09.578
-Well, that's Berta.
-I know Berta.

1:19:09.662 --> 1:19:10.704
That's Berta's husband.

1:19:10.788 --> 1:19:13.291
No, that's Berta's husband,
that's his brother,

1:19:13.374 --> 1:19:16.335
-and I think those are someone's parents.
-And the kids?

1:19:16.419 --> 1:19:19.212
I thought they were all hers,
but now I'm not sure.

1:19:19.297 --> 1:19:20.381
No, this goes.

1:19:20.464 --> 1:19:24.092
Mom... what...
Can we get a minute?

1:19:24.176 --> 1:19:28.306
Fine.
Uh, could you all give us a minute alone?

1:19:28.389 --> 1:19:30.098
Mom, "alone" looks a lot like gas.

1:19:30.182 --> 1:19:32.393
I don't know
how else to communicate with them.

1:19:32.476 --> 1:19:35.354
Leonard Marlin's daughter works at the UN.
I had her come over.

1:19:35.438 --> 1:19:37.356
She doesn't know
what language they speak, either.

1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:39.317
Mom, what is going on here?

1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:41.610
-You mean with the house?
-Start with the house.

1:19:41.694 --> 1:19:43.696
I'm decluttering my life.

1:19:43.779 --> 1:19:45.323
-You know Marie Kondo?
-No.

1:19:45.406 --> 1:19:46.657
-You don't?
-No.

1:19:46.740 --> 1:19:48.409
-She's Japanese.
-Okay.

1:19:48.492 --> 1:19:49.993
-You still don't know her?
-She's Japanese?

1:19:50.077 --> 1:19:51.119
-Yes.
-No.

1:19:51.203 --> 1:19:54.623
She wrote a best-selling book
on decluttering. So, I'm decluttering.

1:19:54.707 --> 1:19:56.584
I was starting to feel claustrophobic.

1:19:56.667 --> 1:20:00.045
I'd wake up in the night feeling like
the house is closing in on me.

1:20:00.128 --> 1:20:02.590
-Like I couldn't breathe, you know?
-Oh, yes, I know.

1:20:02.673 --> 1:20:05.301
One of the ladies in my garden club
bought this book,

1:20:05.384 --> 1:20:07.553
<i>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.</i>

1:20:07.636 --> 1:20:10.598
She said it made everything better.
Are you paying attention?

1:20:10.681 --> 1:20:13.351
<i>-The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up?</i>
-You know it?

1:20:13.434 --> 1:20:15.353
Written by that Japanese woman,
Marie Kondo?

1:20:15.436 --> 1:20:16.604
-Yes.
-No.

1:20:16.687 --> 1:20:18.146
Well, people swear by her.

1:20:18.230 --> 1:20:22.526
She tells you to take everything you own
and put it in piles on the ground.

1:20:22.610 --> 1:20:25.654
Then you pick up each possession
and you hold it.

1:20:25.738 --> 1:20:29.533
If it brings you joy, you keep it,
and if it doesn't, out it goes.

1:20:31.118 --> 1:20:32.620
No joy.

1:20:32.703 --> 1:20:35.414
-He's taking the dining room chairs.
-They don't bring me joy.

1:20:35.498 --> 1:20:39.668
This box needs to be taped.

1:20:39.752 --> 1:20:41.920
Oh, by the way,
if I get a terminal disease,

1:20:42.004 --> 1:20:45.090
I want to move to Washington State to die.
They let you do that there.

1:20:45.173 --> 1:20:46.550
Die? They let you die?

1:20:46.634 --> 1:20:48.886
With dignity and in your own time frame.

1:20:48.969 --> 1:20:52.305
I'll die there and then you need
to ship me back here for burial,

1:20:52.390 --> 1:20:55.017
which costs a fortune, I found out.

1:20:55.100 --> 1:20:59.312
So, in the safe there's an envelope
labeled "body-shipping cash."

1:20:59.397 --> 1:21:01.064
I could also go to Vermont,

1:21:01.148 --> 1:21:03.859
but we vacationed there once
and it was terrible.

1:21:03.942 --> 1:21:05.068
Squirrels.

1:21:05.152 --> 1:21:07.320
So, Washington it is.

1:21:08.739 --> 1:21:09.865
It's the middle of the day.

1:21:09.948 --> 1:21:11.992
Taste it.
See if it brings you joy.

1:21:13.744 --> 1:21:17.080
Oh, God.
I haven't sat down in six hours.

1:21:17.164 --> 1:21:18.374
Cheers.

1:21:22.586 --> 1:21:25.047
So come on, Mom, talk to me.

1:21:26.048 --> 1:21:28.050
Why are you wearing jeans?

1:21:28.133 --> 1:21:30.594
-What?
-Because it's terrifying.

1:21:30.678 --> 1:21:32.680
I started this process with my closet.

1:21:32.763 --> 1:21:35.474
Nothing I owned brought me joy,
so I ran out of clothes.

1:21:35.558 --> 1:21:36.809
I don't know where I got these.

1:21:36.892 --> 1:21:38.852
-They're mine.
-They are?

1:21:38.936 --> 1:21:41.313
Did you not notice
the Billy Squier patch on the butt?

1:21:41.397 --> 1:21:44.608
-You can have them back.
-I have not been pining for them.

1:21:44.692 --> 1:21:46.944
I have to get back to work.
Kitchen's next.

1:21:47.027 --> 1:21:48.862
Stop.
You're not gonna have anything left.

1:21:48.946 --> 1:21:51.532
That's okay.
What I do have will bring me joy.

1:21:51.615 --> 1:21:52.825
Mom...

1:21:54.284 --> 1:21:56.328
nothing is gonna bring you joy right now.

1:21:56.912 --> 1:21:59.331
Nothing. Your husband just died.

1:21:59.415 --> 1:22:03.752
When some time passes and you realize
you've given away all of your stuff,

1:22:03.836 --> 1:22:05.838
you're going to track down
and kill Marie Kondo.

1:22:05.921 --> 1:22:08.215
Then you're gonna go to jail
wearing those jeans,

1:22:08.298 --> 1:22:11.635
and the Winchester Mystery Family
will be living here in your ball gowns.

1:22:13.386 --> 1:22:15.556
-I don't know how to do this.
-Do what?

1:22:15.639 --> 1:22:17.891
-Live my life.
-Oh, Mom...

1:22:17.975 --> 1:22:19.810
I don't know
what to do or where to go.

1:22:19.893 --> 1:22:21.979
I've forgotten
which side of the bed to sleep on.

1:22:22.062 --> 1:22:24.523
I was married for 50 years.

1:22:24.607 --> 1:22:26.024
Half of me is gone.

1:22:27.192 --> 1:22:28.694
Ah, you don't understand.

1:22:28.777 --> 1:22:31.279
-I understand.
-You can't understand. You're not married.

1:22:31.363 --> 1:22:34.199
-Luke and I are as good as married.
-No, you're roommates.

1:22:34.282 --> 1:22:36.744
Someday you'll go off
and find another roommate.

1:22:36.827 --> 1:22:39.746
I had a real partner
for 50 years and now I'm alone.

1:22:43.792 --> 1:22:45.711
Are you still going to that grief group?

1:22:45.794 --> 1:22:48.005
-Oh, God, no.
-Why not?

1:22:48.088 --> 1:22:50.257
All those women
with red noses and Skechers.

1:22:50.340 --> 1:22:53.594
-All they do is sit around and complain.
-What an annoying grief group.

1:22:53.677 --> 1:22:56.555
When it's my turn,
there's no time left to talk about me.

1:22:56.639 --> 1:22:58.974
-Right.
-I have problems. I can't help them.

1:22:59.057 --> 1:23:02.102
Well, what about seeing someone
one-on-one?

1:23:02.686 --> 1:23:04.730
-What do you mean?
-You know, just you and them.

1:23:04.813 --> 1:23:06.524
-Who?
-Just a person.

1:23:06.607 --> 1:23:08.484
-What kind of person?
-A normal person

1:23:08.567 --> 1:23:11.028
with an office and a prescription pad.

1:23:11.111 --> 1:23:13.238
-You mean a psychiatrist.
-That could work, too.

1:23:13.321 --> 1:23:16.283
-You want me to go to therapy.
-Till you get back on your feet.

1:23:16.366 --> 1:23:19.077
I knew it. You have been trying
to get me to a therapist

1:23:19.161 --> 1:23:20.996
ever since you saw that Tony Soprano show.

1:23:21.079 --> 1:23:23.123
I have not.
He did make it look cool though, right?

1:23:23.206 --> 1:23:25.250
-No.
-What's the big deal?

1:23:25.333 --> 1:23:26.585
I'm not crazy.

1:23:26.669 --> 1:23:29.421
No. You're in pain.
This is uncharted territory.

1:23:29.505 --> 1:23:31.715
If it might help, what's the harm?

1:23:33.217 --> 1:23:35.886
-I'll think about it.
-Okay. But really consider it.

1:23:36.887 --> 1:23:39.014
-I will.
-And if you do it, commit.

1:23:39.097 --> 1:23:40.348
You know, really go for it.

1:23:40.432 --> 1:23:42.059
-I will.
-Jump in with both feet.

1:23:42.142 --> 1:23:45.103
Five, six days a week.
Really Woody Allen the hell out of it.

1:23:45.187 --> 1:23:47.397
-I got it.
-'Cause he's totally normal now.

1:23:47.480 --> 1:23:48.982
I promise, Lorelai.

1:23:52.277 --> 1:23:54.238
I'd better try to get my bedroom set back.

1:23:54.947 --> 1:23:57.866
Okay, but first,
don't you think you want to...

1:23:57.950 --> 1:23:58.951
What?

1:24:00.327 --> 1:24:02.037
Oh, God, yes.

1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:49.752
Oy! Danesy-boy!

1:24:49.835 --> 1:24:53.505
So dressing up of the dog
extends to outside of the house now, huh?

1:24:53.589 --> 1:24:55.841
He wanted to go public.
It's a whole new world.

1:24:55.924 --> 1:24:57.968
-Uh-huh.
-I can only support with love,

1:24:58.051 --> 1:24:59.052
not judgment.

1:24:59.136 --> 1:25:00.763
- So that's me.
- Yeah.

1:25:00.846 --> 1:25:03.098
-And that's...
-It's his order pad and pencil.

1:25:03.181 --> 1:25:05.100
Sure, sure.
And the baseball cap?

1:25:05.183 --> 1:25:06.810
His head's too big.
None of yours fit.

1:25:06.894 --> 1:25:09.312
-Oh, okay. Let's get a drink.
-Okay.

1:25:09.396 --> 1:25:10.522
My man!

1:25:12.274 --> 1:25:13.901
-Do I want to know what that's--
-No.

1:25:13.984 --> 1:25:15.235
You don't.

1:25:15.318 --> 1:25:16.779
Okay. Oh.

1:25:16.862 --> 1:25:19.322
-What?
-Uh, nothing.

1:25:19.406 --> 1:25:21.617
-What's up?
-It's just Paris

1:25:21.700 --> 1:25:24.077
sending me pictures of potential,
you know...

1:25:24.161 --> 1:25:26.163
She's tall.
Want to start a basketball team?

1:25:26.246 --> 1:25:28.248
Uh, didn't you say we're not doing that?

1:25:28.331 --> 1:25:30.709
Oh, I e-mailed her
that we're tabling it.

1:25:30.793 --> 1:25:32.127
-Tabling it?
-Back-burnering it?

1:25:32.210 --> 1:25:33.378
Just tell her no.

1:25:33.461 --> 1:25:34.546
-That's what tabling means.
-No.

1:25:34.630 --> 1:25:37.549
That means you'll do it eventually.
Are we doing it eventually?

1:25:37.633 --> 1:25:39.509
-No. You said no.
-And you said no.

1:25:39.593 --> 1:25:40.636
We both said no.

1:25:42.971 --> 1:25:43.972
So...

1:25:47.350 --> 1:25:49.937
Don't need a surrogate.

1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:52.105
Done. Let's get that drink.

1:25:52.731 --> 1:25:53.649
Okay.

1:25:54.524 --> 1:25:56.443
Two big gloggs.

1:25:56.526 --> 1:25:58.946
Hey, Kirk.
Taking the day off of Ööö-bering?

1:25:59.029 --> 1:26:01.740
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-You know, Ööö-ber.

1:26:01.824 --> 1:26:03.491
-No.
-Kirk, Ööö--

1:26:03.575 --> 1:26:04.827
Stop making that noise.

1:26:04.910 --> 1:26:09.206
If anyone from the Uber corporation
or their handsome attorneys contacts you,

1:26:09.289 --> 1:26:11.124
please tell them it was my brother

1:26:11.208 --> 1:26:15.671
and not me, who recklessly violated
trademark laws and perpetrated fraud.

1:26:15.754 --> 1:26:18.716
Dirk has always been a disappointment
to the family.

1:26:18.799 --> 1:26:19.800
Your gloggs.

1:26:19.883 --> 1:26:21.551
-Kirk--
-Next!

1:26:21.634 --> 1:26:24.054
Okay. Your car is done.

1:26:24.137 --> 1:26:27.766
I do not guarantee it will make it home,
or even out of the gas station.

1:26:27.850 --> 1:26:29.184
I bet it will.

1:26:29.267 --> 1:26:31.770
Come get it now. It's idling.
I'm afraid to turn it off.

1:26:31.854 --> 1:26:33.563
Okay, we'll be right there.
Love you.

1:26:33.646 --> 1:26:34.857
Buy a new car.

1:26:34.940 --> 1:26:37.275
-Where's Paul Anka?
-He's chasing ice skaters.

1:26:37.359 --> 1:26:39.569
Oh, boy. Hi, Mom.

1:26:39.652 --> 1:26:41.947
-You answered. You never answer.
<i>-I did.</i>

1:26:42.030 --> 1:26:43.949
-Sure I do.
<i>-Are you drunk?</i>

1:26:44.032 --> 1:26:45.283
Mom, what can I help you with?

1:26:45.367 --> 1:26:47.703
I just wanted you to know
that I took your advice.

1:26:47.786 --> 1:26:50.038
-Are you drunk?
<i>-I found a therapist.</i>

1:26:50.122 --> 1:26:52.875
-You're kidding.
-Linda in my garden club is bipolar,

1:26:52.958 --> 1:26:55.335
so I asked if she had someone
she could recommend.

1:26:55.418 --> 1:26:57.504
<i>-Good thinking.</i>
-She's a lovely woman.

1:26:57.587 --> 1:26:59.131
-Linda?
<i>-No. The therapist.</i>

1:26:59.214 --> 1:27:01.759
Linda's a nightmare.
She cries if the tea is cold.

1:27:01.842 --> 1:27:05.721
But the therapist is wonderful.
Very tasteful office.

1:27:05.804 --> 1:27:07.472
She burns a candle
that smells so delicious,

1:27:07.555 --> 1:27:08.766
I bought one to have at home.

1:27:08.849 --> 1:27:10.017
Sounds great.

1:27:10.100 --> 1:27:11.852
<i>-I could get one for you.</i>
-Sure.

1:27:11.935 --> 1:27:15.355
I go there once a week and we just talk.
Talk about anything.

1:27:15.438 --> 1:27:18.525
-Or nothing if there's nothing on my mind.
-Sounds great, Mom.

1:27:18.608 --> 1:27:20.693
She told me to get rid
of the Marie Kondo book.

1:27:20.778 --> 1:27:22.946
I like her already.
Hey, I did something right.

1:27:23.030 --> 1:27:24.156
Law of averages.

1:27:24.239 --> 1:27:27.951
I bought a notebook so I can write down
things I want to discuss with her.

1:27:28.035 --> 1:27:30.453
-That way I won't forget.
-Very sensible.

1:27:30.537 --> 1:27:32.873
I told her it was your idea
that I come see her.

1:27:32.956 --> 1:27:33.957
You did?

1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:36.793
<i>I did. Thank you, Lorelai.</i>

1:27:36.877 --> 1:27:40.047
<i>Thank you for suggesting it.</i>
<i>I think it's exactly what I needed.</i>

1:27:40.130 --> 1:27:43.466
Wow, I'm so glad, Mom. Really.

1:27:43.550 --> 1:27:46.511
-I'd love for you to meet her sometime.
-Sure.

1:27:46.594 --> 1:27:48.305
Maybe next time I go, you could come by.

1:27:48.388 --> 1:27:51.224
Oh, Mom, I would love
to meet your therapist.

1:27:51.308 --> 1:27:55.353
<i>Really? Great.</i>
<i>I go on Tuesday at 3:00.</i>

1:27:55.437 --> 1:27:56.772
Tuesday's probably fine.

1:27:56.855 --> 1:27:59.024
<i>Wonderful!</i>
<i>Oh, you're going to love her.</i>

1:27:59.107 --> 1:28:00.233
I'll text you the address?

1:28:00.317 --> 1:28:01.484
Text away.

1:28:01.568 --> 1:28:04.279
<i>-See you then.</i>
-See you then, Mom. Bye.

1:28:05.738 --> 1:28:08.408
-What sort of attack are you having?
-Are you crazy?

1:28:08.491 --> 1:28:10.452
-Why?
-You're going to therapy with your mother!

1:28:10.535 --> 1:28:12.537
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

1:28:12.621 --> 1:28:13.747
She wants me to meet her.

1:28:13.831 --> 1:28:16.792
- What do you think that means?
- Luke, look.

1:28:16.875 --> 1:28:20.170
My mother took my advice.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1:28:20.253 --> 1:28:22.172
The advice that I gave her,
she took it.

1:28:22.255 --> 1:28:24.549
That's never happened before.
Ever.

1:28:24.632 --> 1:28:28.053
She's feeling good about it
and just wanted me to meet her--

1:28:28.136 --> 1:28:30.138
Oh, crap!
I'm going to therapy with my mother!

1:28:36.061 --> 1:28:38.772
- Oh, boy.
- Come on.
