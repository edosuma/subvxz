00:06.797 --> 00:08.429
Hey, Kennedy!
What's up?

00:08.429 --> 00:10.010
What's up?
What's up?

00:11.892 --> 00:14.765
I'll tell you what's up.
Unemployment, ocean levels,
the national debt!

00:14.765 --> 00:18.059
And me, I'm up!
Fed up with you!

00:21.482 --> 00:22.813
Well, that was weird.

00:22.813 --> 00:24.315
No kidding.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.947
Unemployment is actually
down a tenth of a point
this week.

00:28.739 --> 00:30.781
She seems really mean,

00:30.781 --> 00:34.034
which is odd because
Fletcher has been dating
her for weeks now

00:34.034 --> 00:36.036
and he seems completely
devoted to her.

00:36.827 --> 00:38.159
More garbage,
my darling?

00:44.625 --> 00:46.167
What are you doing?

00:47.218 --> 00:49.170
You're completely
humiliating yourself.

00:50.010 --> 00:51.382
I have a good reason.

00:51.382 --> 00:52.673
Not you.

00:52.673 --> 00:54.135
I was talking
to the goat.

00:56.847 --> 00:58.639
I'm trying to break up
with Kennedy.

00:59.180 --> 01:01.232
So you can date
the goat?

01:02.183 --> 01:03.444
No.

01:03.444 --> 01:05.025
Every time I try to
end things with Kennedy,

01:05.025 --> 01:08.319
I get confused
when she uses all her
fancy debate terms

01:08.319 --> 01:11.282
like "burden of proof"
and "shut it, I'm talking."

01:13.194 --> 01:15.826
So I'm trying to create
a scandal that will threaten
her political future.

01:16.407 --> 01:18.699
When she sees this,
she'll have no choice
but to break up with me.

01:18.999 --> 01:20.501
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

01:21.752 --> 01:23.624
Fletcher!
 Kennedy!

01:23.624 --> 01:26.507
It's not what
it looks like!
 (BLEATS)

01:26.757 --> 01:29.089
Well, what it looks
like to me is that
you're an animal lover.

01:29.630 --> 01:31.212
Oh, no.
 (BLEATS)

01:31.212 --> 01:32.633
My secret is out.

01:33.714 --> 01:34.635
And I'm glad it is.

01:35.306 --> 01:36.427
Huh?

01:38.519 --> 01:41.142
The latest polls have shown
that Americans prefer animals
to humans by a wide margin.

01:41.562 --> 01:43.934
This will give
a huge boost
to my campaign.

01:43.934 --> 01:47.278
Let me get a picture
 you and the goat.
 (BLEATS)

01:48.319 --> 01:49.530
Kissing.

01:50.731 --> 01:52.363
Excuse me?

01:52.823 --> 01:54.074
Kiss the goat!

01:54.074 --> 01:56.617
Not for me,
but for our
fellow citizens!

01:56.617 --> 02:00.871
Let the people of
this great nation see
how much you love animals!

02:00.871 --> 02:04.795
Oh, yeah!
As a future voter,
I'd like to see that.

Rumor has it
you totally bombed
your math test.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.408
I did. Look at this!

03:17.408 --> 03:20.200
A 93!
That's the lowest
A you can get!

03:21.622 --> 03:22.993
My future is over!

03:24.585 --> 03:26.377
Now, I'll have to go
to some clown college.
Like Cornell!

03:27.878 --> 03:30.421
Well, you're dressed
for clown college.

03:31.292 --> 03:33.093
I don't understand
how this happened.

03:33.634 --> 03:37.468
My eidetic memory
has always made taking
tests easy as pie.

03:38.098 --> 03:39.260
An expression
I never understood,

03:39.260 --> 03:41.262
because making a pie
is not easy.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.395
Especially the crust.
The crust is everything.

03:45.436 --> 03:47.898
Math isn't about
rote memorization.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.400
It's about
problem solving.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.402
Something you clearly
haven't mastered

03:51.402 --> 03:54.275
or you would have solved
the problem of your
irritating personality.

03:54.615 --> 03:55.906
I know!

03:57.738 --> 04:01.452
And the worst part is,
the teacher said
I need to get a tutor.

04:01.452 --> 04:06.246
Wow. I pity the poor
soul who gets stuck
having to tutor you.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.498
What a nightmare.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.132
It's me, isn't it?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.800
There's Kennedy.
She's so mean.

04:21.882 --> 04:22.933
What are you doing?

04:24.345 --> 04:25.386
I don't want her to notice me,
so I'm trying to blend in.

04:26.146 --> 04:27.938
I'm pretending
to be a coffee table.

04:29.940 --> 04:32.102
But you don't look
anything like a coffee table.

04:34.485 --> 04:36.397
Hey! Use a coaster!

04:37.358 --> 04:40.160
Hey, Olive.
I love your hair today.

04:40.451 --> 04:42.363
It reminds me of
amber waves of grain,

04:42.363 --> 04:45.326
a staple of
our great nation's
farming industry.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.247
Also, we have
a coffee table
at home

04:47.247 --> 04:49.169
that looks
just like this.

04:49.169 --> 04:50.331
Thank you!

04:50.331 --> 04:51.912
I mean...

04:51.912 --> 04:53.414
Table sound.

04:55.085 --> 04:57.217
Well, if you
like her hair,

04:57.217 --> 04:59.380
what do you think about
my new purple outfit?

04:59.380 --> 05:01.922
Doesn't it just scream
"purple mountain majesties?"

05:02.383 --> 05:03.764
Really, Chyna?

05:03.764 --> 05:05.426
Purple is the color
of royalty.

05:05.426 --> 05:07.558
You might as well
just slap a crown
on your head

05:07.558 --> 05:09.269
and pretend
the Revolutionary War
never happened!

05:12.983 --> 05:15.856
You were right.
She is so nice.

05:16.196 --> 05:17.488
She just hates you.

05:18.238 --> 05:20.110
But she can't hate me.

05:20.110 --> 05:21.862
Kennedy and Fletcher
are a couple now,

05:22.112 --> 05:23.614
and if she doesn't
like me, then,

05:23.614 --> 05:25.245
we'll never get to
hang out with him.

05:25.866 --> 05:29.249
Perfect! He'll be out
of our lives forever!

05:29.249 --> 05:30.791
And isn't his birthday
coming up?

05:30.791 --> 05:32.663
Now we won't have to
get him a present!

05:34.164 --> 05:36.417
I don't want him
out of our lives.

05:36.417 --> 05:38.879
I need to do something
about this.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.672
Oh, I know
what this is about.

05:42.222 --> 05:44.014
You just can't
deal with people
not liking you.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.057
That is so not true.

05:47.057 --> 05:48.389
And what do you mean
"people" not liking me?

05:48.389 --> 05:50.431
Who else doesn't like me?

05:51.392 --> 05:54.274
Let's not focus on
the dozens of people
who don't like you.

05:54.274 --> 05:56.977
Let's just focus on the reason
why Kennedy can't stand
the sight of you.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.029
You know what?

05:59.029 --> 06:01.402
I'm just going to talk
to Kennedy and get to
the bottom of this.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.033
I mean, she seems
approachable.

06:05.746 --> 06:07.618
Hey, Kenne...
 Security breach!

06:09.079 --> 06:10.951
Wait! I just have
one question.
 (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

06:11.492 --> 06:13.414
You guys like
me, right?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.129
Lexi, thank you
for tutoring me.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.052
Well, my friends rate
is $20 an hour.

06:22.052 --> 06:23.844
So for you, 30.

06:26.346 --> 06:29.470
Okay, let's start off with
some polynomial functions.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.722
When solving for x,
the first step is

06:31.722 --> 06:34.274
to find the degree
of the polynomial.

06:34.855 --> 06:36.477
Okay. So...

06:36.477 --> 06:40.651
Two x-squared plus
three x minus two...

06:41.982 --> 06:43.283
Why are you sweeping?

06:43.524 --> 06:46.657
Oh, I think better
when I clean.
Don't mind me.

06:47.237 --> 06:48.449
Legs!

06:51.452 --> 06:55.295
So whenever we study,
you have to clean?

06:55.876 --> 06:58.128
No. I don't
have to clean.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.461
I want to clean.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.842
I'm not some freak.

07:03.133 --> 07:05.305
Two x-squared plus
three x minus two...

07:06.006 --> 07:07.347
You know what?

07:07.347 --> 07:09.429
I think, we need to find
a better place to study.

07:10.350 --> 07:11.351
My room!

07:13.263 --> 07:15.646
And why is this better
than studying in my room?

07:16.607 --> 07:20.941
Because studies show that
people learn better by
changing their environments.

07:21.772 --> 07:23.063
Oh, I read that study.

07:23.063 --> 07:24.364
You did?

07:25.866 --> 07:27.868
Yeah. Cognitive psychologists
have found that when you study

07:27.868 --> 07:31.281
you can improve your
comprehension and retention
by altering your locations.

07:31.532 --> 07:33.123
Although,
if that were true,

07:33.123 --> 07:35.165
wouldn't flight attendants
be the smartest people
in the world?

07:36.416 --> 07:38.499
Free vacations
and dates with pilots?

07:38.749 --> 07:40.420
(CHUCKLES) Aren't they?

07:41.291 --> 07:44.755
Anyway, I've provided you
with some sample
trigonometry problems.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.256
I've also provided you
with hampers

07:46.256 --> 07:48.759
for whites, lights, darks
and hand-wash only.

07:55.596 --> 07:57.598
Lexi, I don't know
what to do.

07:57.598 --> 07:59.650
I want to ask Kennedy
what her problem is with me,

07:59.650 --> 08:01.652
but she won't
even talk to me.

08:01.652 --> 08:02.773
Can you believe that?

08:04.735 --> 08:07.277
No one's ever
treated me
that way before.

08:07.277 --> 08:08.488
It's like
I don't even exist.

08:11.411 --> 08:14.324
Well, maybe she just has
nothing nice to say to me,

08:14.324 --> 08:16.246
so she'd rather not say
anything at all.

08:20.290 --> 08:23.253
Well, whatever the reason,
I need to fix the situation.

08:24.124 --> 08:25.335
But how?

08:25.335 --> 08:26.757
I can't even get
close to her

08:26.757 --> 08:28.629
because
she's hired her own
Secret Service guys

08:28.629 --> 08:30.801
to make her look
more presidential.

08:32.342 --> 08:33.433
That's it.

08:34.224 --> 08:36.436
Great idea!
Thanks, Lexi!

Ms. Van Buren,
I need to warn you
about a potential threat.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.504
We've intercepted chatter

09:04.504 --> 09:08.168
that people have
been impersonating
Secret Service agents.

09:08.168 --> 09:10.380
Is there anyone you know
who doesn't like you?

09:10.380 --> 09:12.803
Or more importantly,
anyone you don't like?

09:12.803 --> 09:15.305
And if so, why?
Let's go alphabetically.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.678
Starting with
the letter C-H.

09:19.179 --> 09:22.232
Before we do that,
I have one request.
 Name it.

09:22.232 --> 09:24.314
Stop trying to steal
my boyfriend, Chyna!

09:25.686 --> 09:27.688
Kennedy, wait!
 (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

09:28.568 --> 09:29.569
Oh!

09:31.321 --> 09:34.194
It's time
for your break,
Vic.

09:34.194 --> 09:35.866
I mean Frank.

Patrick?

09:38.198 --> 09:39.289
Vincent?

09:49.549 --> 09:54.054
Kennedy! Do you seriously
think I'm trying to
steal your boyfriend?

09:54.054 --> 09:57.177
Yes. Like all girls,
you find Fletcher
irresistible.

09:58.058 --> 09:59.099
Fletcher?

10:00.350 --> 10:01.722
Did you break up
with the Fletcher
I know

10:01.722 --> 10:03.313
and start dating
some gorgeous model
named Fletcher?

10:04.434 --> 10:06.727
Stop pretending like
you're not interested.

10:07.317 --> 10:09.319
Kennedy, I'm not.

10:09.319 --> 10:12.863
I am actually thrilled
that he's found someone
and that he's so in love.

10:13.573 --> 10:15.035
He said that?

10:15.035 --> 10:16.657
He said he's in love?

10:17.327 --> 10:20.791
Well, we haven't
actually discussed it,
but I can tell.

10:21.001 --> 10:23.123
He even has
a picture of you
next to his bed.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.085
FLETCHER: Take this,
Kennedy!

10:25.085 --> 10:26.336
(GRUNTS)

10:28.128 --> 10:29.169
(GRUNTS)

10:36.887 --> 10:39.259
In fact, I bet he's
missing you right now.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.316
Chyna, I really appreciate
you helping me figure out

10:46.316 --> 10:48.268
what to get Fletcher
for his birthday.

10:48.268 --> 10:51.692
What can I say?
I'm a likeable friend.
Who you like.

10:52.072 --> 10:53.113
Am I right, guys?

10:55.866 --> 10:58.038
Anyway, I'm thinking of
getting Fletcher a lunch

10:58.038 --> 11:01.041
with former Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz.

11:03.123 --> 11:06.286
I think his Grandma Dottie
got him that for Christmas.

11:09.209 --> 11:10.711
But you know what
he'd really love?

11:10.711 --> 11:12.212
If you threw him
a surprise party.

11:12.502 --> 11:14.134
You can get
all his friends
to come.

11:15.886 --> 11:18.849
Plus some other random people
so the room doesn't seem
so empty.

11:19.219 --> 11:22.723
Great! We'll have
lots of red, white,
and blue streamers.

11:23.013 --> 11:25.225
Actually, Fletcher is
afraid of streamers.

11:26.016 --> 11:27.147
Why?

11:28.398 --> 11:31.611
Hey, look at me!
I'm a streamer mummy.

11:33.073 --> 11:34.614
Pinata time!

11:34.945 --> 11:36.026
(SCREAMING)

11:41.321 --> 11:44.204
Fine, but we can have
tons of balloons!

11:45.125 --> 11:48.038
Actually,
Fletcher is afraid
of balloons.

11:48.588 --> 11:50.590
Why would he be
afraid of balloons?

11:51.131 --> 11:54.004
Behold the wonders
of static electricity.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.305
Fine.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.308
You take him out
to dinner while we
set everything up.

12:08.308 --> 12:09.689
Then I'll send a text
to Fletcher

12:09.689 --> 12:11.401
and tell him to meet me
in the boys' lounge.

12:11.401 --> 12:15.115
Then, when he walks in,
everybody will jump up
and yell, "Surprise!"

12:15.525 --> 12:18.238
Actually, Fletcher's afraid
of the word "surprise."

12:18.738 --> 12:19.860
Why?

12:21.321 --> 12:22.702
Surprise!

12:23.033 --> 12:25.205
Is that supposed
to scare me?

12:25.205 --> 12:27.287
Ooh, I'm startled!
 (DUCK QUACKS)

12:30.420 --> 12:33.173
Did I say "surprise"?
I meant "duck."

12:34.424 --> 12:37.838
I think it might be safer
if we said something else
that meant surprise.

12:38.218 --> 12:40.220
How about everyone
jumps out and yells,

12:40.680 --> 12:43.093
"Unforeseen
circumstance!"
(LAUGHS)

12:51.151 --> 12:53.023
A 95.
That's good.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.816
That's five less
than 100.

12:57.447 --> 13:00.240
I just needed a little help
in math, I'm not five.

13:00.861 --> 13:03.243
Five! Very good!

13:03.864 --> 13:06.116
One, two, three,
four, five.

13:08.748 --> 13:10.790
Since you need
a little bit more help,

13:10.790 --> 13:13.333
we're going to study
in Angus's room today.

13:13.583 --> 13:17.087
That makes sense.
But do I really need
this math cart?

13:19.379 --> 13:20.841
Yes.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.263
Where else are
you going to keep
your graph paper?

13:24.184 --> 13:25.805
And your toilet paper?

13:27.057 --> 13:28.688
Now let's get cracking.

13:28.688 --> 13:31.771
I have a whole list of
other places we need
to study later.

13:31.771 --> 13:33.733
For instance, at 3:30

13:33.733 --> 13:37.197
we're studying at
a six bedroom house
in Santa Cruz.

13:42.242 --> 13:43.573
Tutoring.

13:45.745 --> 13:47.157
Tutoring.

13:59.009 --> 14:01.591
Hey, we said $20.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.223
I'm only paying half
because I thought

14:03.223 --> 14:05.515
she was going to be
in a cute maid's outfit.

14:11.181 --> 14:12.732
(BLEATS)

14:12.732 --> 14:15.855
The trash you don't eat
still needs to be
thrown away.

14:16.236 --> 14:17.777
What were you,
raised in a barn?

14:19.689 --> 14:23.443
Dude, as much as I enjoy
watching you and your
goat wife bicker,

14:24.784 --> 14:29.119
I have it on good authority
that Kennedy and Chyna
have become friends.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.700
That's very good for you.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.164
The girlfriend I can't stand
is now friends with
the girlfriend I can't get?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.256
How is that good?

14:36.256 --> 14:39.049
Kennedy will talk
to Chyna about what
a great guy you are,

14:39.049 --> 14:41.671
and Chyna will realize
what she's missing out on.

14:41.671 --> 14:43.133
Then, she'll ask you out.

14:43.803 --> 14:44.884
You really think so?

14:46.176 --> 14:49.139
Isn't that what happens
in every Shakespeare play?

14:50.060 --> 14:51.972
I'm asking
because I don't know.
I have a report due.

14:56.226 --> 14:57.567
Hey, Fletcher.

14:57.567 --> 14:58.898
Since tomorrow
is your birthday,

14:58.898 --> 15:01.021
I was hoping I could do
something special for you.

15:01.021 --> 15:02.192
Can I take you out
to dinner?

15:04.324 --> 15:05.525
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

15:05.525 --> 15:07.697
Perfect. Then let's meet
here tomorrow at 6:00.

15:10.450 --> 15:11.791
You were right.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.373
Chyna is totally
into me!

15:13.703 --> 15:16.876
This is going to be
the best birthday ever!

15:16.876 --> 15:18.088
(BLEATS)

15:19.709 --> 15:21.341
"Meh"? Really?

15:21.341 --> 15:25.005
Everything's "meh" with you.
I'm tired of your negativity.

15:32.812 --> 15:35.555
I didn't know they
even sold math smocks.

15:36.186 --> 15:38.608
The calculator apron
is convenient and stylish.

15:41.821 --> 15:44.824
But do we really need to
have our tutoring session
in this hotel?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.616
Yes. (CHUCKLES)

15:46.616 --> 15:48.778
What better place
to study math?

15:48.778 --> 15:51.531
I read that Pythagoras
came up with his theorem

15:51.531 --> 15:53.453
at a Snuggle Time
Comfort Lodge.

15:55.535 --> 15:59.339
Anyway, I'll be back
in two hours to
check in on your work.

15:59.839 --> 16:03.003
You focus on
quadratic equations.
In every room.

16:03.753 --> 16:06.846
Except for the ones
that say "Do not disturb."

16:07.347 --> 16:09.259
Somebody else is
studying in those rooms.

16:11.221 --> 16:16.806
So if A-squared equals
B-squared plus C-squared
minus two B-C cosine A,

16:16.806 --> 16:19.479
then B-squared equals...
Mother of pearl!

16:21.191 --> 16:23.443
Where did all this
hair come from?

16:24.814 --> 16:26.606
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

16:27.697 --> 16:28.988
Principal Skidmore?

16:29.659 --> 16:31.741
Student I barely remember?

16:34.874 --> 16:36.076
What are you
doing here?

16:36.616 --> 16:38.418
And why do you have
a math smock?

16:39.289 --> 16:41.000
I'm not
Principal Skidmore
anymore.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.963
Because you Ants
left Webster,
I lost my job.

16:44.884 --> 16:47.837
Well, that and because
I drove my car through
the wall of the school.

16:48.798 --> 16:50.300
Sorry to hear that.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.972
Are you kidding?
Best thing that ever
happened to me.

16:52.972 --> 16:56.226
I get a lot more respect
as a maid than I ever did
as a high school principal.

16:56.976 --> 16:58.808
But now I've lost
my job again

16:58.808 --> 17:01.601
thanks to you
and your cut-rate
maid services!

17:01.601 --> 17:04.733
There must be some
misunderstanding.
I'm not a maid.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.606
Lexi's just my math tutor
and she thought
it would be good

17:06.606 --> 17:09.779
if I studied here
with my math cart,
wearing my math smock,

17:09.779 --> 17:12.992
and for some reason she
told me to put little mints
on the pillows once I was...

17:13.742 --> 17:15.785
What the heck?
I'm a maid!

17:17.747 --> 17:19.709
Not on my turf,
you're not!

17:19.709 --> 17:22.541
Hey! Easy with my
geometry wand! I need
that to draw circles!

17:30.970 --> 17:32.342
Thanks for dinner.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.884
I always like to try new,
unusual ethnic foods.

17:35.265 --> 17:37.056
You had spaghetti
with butter.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.771
(IN ITALIAN ACCENT) Spaghetti!
It just sounds so exotic!

17:43.273 --> 17:45.355
So, you want to go back
to the boys' lounge
for some dessert?

17:45.605 --> 17:47.777
I have...
(IN ITALIAN ACCENT)
...some jelly beans!

17:48.778 --> 17:50.950
No! Um...

17:50.950 --> 17:52.782
Let's go up
to the roof.

17:52.782 --> 17:56.075
It's a beautiful night
to gaze at the stars.

17:56.996 --> 17:58.748
(CHUCKLES SHYLY)
Okay.

18:01.541 --> 18:04.164
Look at the stars.
They're beautiful.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.587
But not as beautiful
as you.

18:08.338 --> 18:11.551
Yeah, the stars
just go on forever.

18:12.212 --> 18:13.763
Kind of like
this evening.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.476
So...

18:17.677 --> 18:19.389
Do you know anything
about constellations?

18:19.679 --> 18:20.850
Do I ever.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.773
Just eat a bran muffin
and things will start
moving again.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.646
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

18:26.646 --> 18:28.398
Fletcher.
You are really...

18:28.398 --> 18:29.649
Weird.

18:29.649 --> 18:30.820
...special.

18:32.192 --> 18:34.194
Thanks. I think
you're special, too.

18:34.494 --> 18:37.497
Nothing girls like
more than healthy
bowel tips.

18:37.497 --> 18:39.289
I am crushing it!

18:44.664 --> 18:46.045
So, what should we do?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.748
How about this?

18:49.549 --> 18:50.630
(GASPS)

18:53.343 --> 18:54.634
What are you doing?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.806
I'm sorry.
I thought that's
what you wanted.

18:57.257 --> 18:59.639
No, we're just friends!

19:00.350 --> 19:03.183
Besides,
you have a girlfriend!
You love her!

19:03.473 --> 19:05.475
I don't love her.
She's a goat.

19:07.357 --> 19:08.858
I was talking
about Kennedy.

19:09.859 --> 19:12.482
I only started dating her
to get you interested in me,

19:13.233 --> 19:14.774
but clearly
you're not.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.777
And I've been trying
to break up with
Kennedy for weeks,

19:17.777 --> 19:19.489
but she never lets me
get the words out.

19:19.869 --> 19:21.661
I totally missed that.

19:22.702 --> 19:23.953
(PHONE BEEPS)

19:26.666 --> 19:27.837
It's a text
from Kennedy.

19:28.127 --> 19:29.709
She wants me to meet her
in the boys' lounge.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.462
You know what?
I'm just going to
march in there

19:32.462 --> 19:34.173
and blurt out that
I'm breaking up with her,

19:34.173 --> 19:35.925
before she has a chance
to say anything
and talk me out of it.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.847
No! Wait!
You can't!

19:38.348 --> 19:40.350
Surprise!
 (DUCK QUACKS)

19:42.932 --> 19:44.974
Kennedy, I don't know
how to say this,

19:45.475 --> 19:46.766
but you need to
cancel the party.

19:47.066 --> 19:48.898
What do you mean
cancel the party?

19:48.898 --> 19:51.691
I am so sorry,
but Fletcher is not
in love with you.

19:52.312 --> 19:54.864
He told me he was
planning to burst in here
and break up with you.

19:55.114 --> 19:56.906
I would have
told you sooner,

19:56.906 --> 19:58.698
but it was
an unforeseen
circumstance!

19:58.698 --> 20:00.700
ALL: Unforeseen circumstance!

20:01.701 --> 20:04.454
Man, you guys are
some good hiders!

20:07.747 --> 20:09.539
I thought we were
friends, Chyna.

20:09.539 --> 20:11.090
I can't believe
you would come
in here

20:11.090 --> 20:12.922
and lie to my face!

20:12.922 --> 20:14.093
What are you
talking about?

20:15.675 --> 20:16.716
You just want me
to cancel the party
and break up with Fletcher

20:16.716 --> 20:18.508
so you can have him
for yourself!

20:18.838 --> 20:21.341
Kennedy, please,
just call off
the party, quick!

20:21.341 --> 20:23.142
Because once
those doors open,

20:23.142 --> 20:25.475
this is going to be
the most humiliating
moment of your life!

20:27.687 --> 20:30.350
Kennedy, I...
 ALL: Unforeseen circumstance!

20:34.904 --> 20:37.737
Kennedy,
there's something
I need to tell you.

20:38.568 --> 20:40.280
Something I should have
said a long time ago.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.742
Fletcher, wait...
 No, I need
to say this.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.746
Kennedy...

20:47.707 --> 20:50.370
You are the
sweetest girlfriend
in the whole world!

20:56.836 --> 20:58.137
This is why
no one likes you.

21:01.431 --> 21:02.842
What happened?

21:02.842 --> 21:03.933
I thought you
didn't like her.

21:03.933 --> 21:05.555
I thought so too.

21:05.555 --> 21:09.599
But I guess I was so focused
on the fact she wasn't you,

21:09.599 --> 21:11.230
I couldn't see all
her good qualities.

21:11.811 --> 21:14.103
And look,
there are no scary
streamers or balloons.

21:14.814 --> 21:17.697
Only someone who really
cares about me would think
of details like that.

21:19.238 --> 21:20.660
You're right.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.112
Well, I'm just happy
you're happy.

21:23.703 --> 21:25.034
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING)

21:25.034 --> 21:26.746
Fletcher, sweetie,
you want to dance?

21:26.746 --> 21:27.827
It's a slow song.

21:28.868 --> 21:30.460
(CHUCKLES SHYLY)
Okay.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.794
Now that was
a surprise.
 (DUCK QUACKS)

21:38.968 --> 21:41.090
Why did we name
that duck Surprise?

21:41.761 --> 21:43.973
And teach it to come
when we call it?

21:53.022 --> 21:56.816
There you are, Olive.
What are you still doing
in the same room?

21:59.399 --> 22:00.740
Oh!

22:00.740 --> 22:02.652
You're working
on geometry.

22:03.443 --> 22:04.704
Guess who I ran into?

22:04.944 --> 22:06.406
(TOILET FLUSHES)

22:13.873 --> 22:14.794
Who?

22:16.215 --> 22:18.378
Principal Skidmore,
the old maid.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.761
Who, unrelated
to her nickname,
"the old maid,"

22:21.761 --> 22:23.763
is literally
the old maid.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.097
Because apparently,
I'm the new maid!

22:28.808 --> 22:30.810
Well, you won't
be the new maid
for long,

22:30.810 --> 22:33.102
talking to your
supervisor like that.

22:34.684 --> 22:36.736
I can't believe
you've been
charging people

22:36.736 --> 22:38.528
$20 for me to
clean their rooms

22:38.528 --> 22:40.780
while I've been paying
you $30 to tutor me!

22:41.821 --> 22:43.653
I don't know how you thought
you'd get away with this,

22:43.653 --> 22:46.035
but nobody
pulls the wool
over my eyes,

22:46.035 --> 22:48.698
except for me,
when I put on a
wool turtleneck!

22:50.199 --> 22:51.621
You're right.

22:51.621 --> 22:54.123
I'm sorry. I have been
treating you unfairly.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.416
And to make
it up to you...

22:56.416 --> 22:59.208
I won't charge
you $30 an
hour anymore.

22:59.208 --> 23:00.670
I'll charge you 20.

23:02.842 --> 23:03.883
Thank you!

23:06.426 --> 23:08.888
No one takes advantage
of Olive Doyle.

23:09.719 --> 23:11.350
Hey, new girl,
get in here.

23:11.721 --> 23:13.182
This is a two-person job.

23:16.476 --> 23:17.817
No one.
