00:09.905 --> 00:12.708
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:12.408 --> 00:14.277
Have any cobwebs you just can't shake?

00:14.477 --> 00:17.313
This is mine.
I want to know.

00:17.513 --> 00:19.549
I want to know who tormented my sister.

00:21.217 --> 00:23.653
You're a goddamn dead man.

00:23.853 --> 00:27.190
You smell like a saloon,
loaded man, loaded gun.

00:27.390 --> 00:28.574
It's not good, Bill.

00:28.774 --> 00:29.759
You almost shot a kid.

00:29.959 --> 00:31.427
How much have you been drinking lately?

00:31.627 --> 00:32.395
Not enough.

00:32.595 --> 00:34.564
I don't want to go
to your funeral in 6 months.

00:35.865 --> 00:37.434
What does it do?

00:37.634 --> 00:40.503
Let's just say it activates

00:40.703 --> 00:42.955
and deactivates almost anything I want.

00:43.155 --> 00:45.408
Brady, my deeper concern runs to you.

00:45.608 --> 00:46.443
You're weird.

00:46.643 --> 00:48.912
Sometimes you come across
as just plain weird.

00:52.115 --> 00:53.650
Oh, Jesus! God!

00:53.850 --> 00:56.920
Got a letter from my new pen pal,
put this one in writing.

00:57.120 --> 00:57.987
"Care to get in touch?

00:58.187 --> 00:59.989
Try Under Debbie's Blue Umbrella."

Mom?

02:57.240 --> 02:59.843
Wait, Brady.

03:00.043 --> 03:02.261
Brady, honey, honey, no.

03:02.461 --> 03:04.680
GGo... Go to bed, honey.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.717
Go to bed, okay?

03:07.917 --> 03:08.718
Stop it.

03:08.918 --> 03:11.254
It's big people time, okay?

03:11.454 --> 03:12.522
Okay, honey?

03:12.722 --> 03:13.589
Beat it, you little shit.

03:16.426 --> 03:18.761
Good boy, go... go... go to bed.

03:18.961 --> 03:21.998
MomMommy's having private time,
good boy.

03:22.198 --> 03:25.401
Okay.

03:32.275 --> 03:35.545
Oh!

03:39.949 --> 03:42.251
Oh, my god.

03:42.451 --> 03:44.754
Oh, God. Oh!

03:54.831 --> 03:57.600
And good morning, Ohio. I'm John Moore.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.601
And I'm Amanda Collins.

03:58.801 --> 04:00.036
We have a lot coming up for you,

04:00.236 --> 04:02.205
the latest on the big trial
we've been following,

04:02.405 --> 04:03.573
obviously, some traffic this morning

04:03.773 --> 04:05.308
you need to know about,
and your weather.

04:05.508 --> 04:07.026
But, first, going to a segment.

04:07.226 --> 04:08.544
We're going to talk about your dog

04:08.744 --> 04:11.714
and how obedient that dog
is around the house.

04:11.914 --> 04:13.650
I got this problem with...

04:13.850 --> 04:15.818
Maybe the problem is more with
my wife than with the dog.

04:16.017 --> 04:18.553
But the dog, this big German Shepherd,

04:18.754 --> 04:20.189
kind of thinks the place is his,

04:20.389 --> 04:21.390
and he is on that couch...

04:21.589 --> 04:22.659
Hey, come sit.

04:22.859 --> 04:24.077
every time my wife leaves the room.

04:24.277 --> 04:25.295
I feel like he's looking...
I'm fine.

04:25.495 --> 04:27.063
over at me, "Hey,
she doesn't know we're here."

04:27.263 --> 04:28.331
It's not healthy to eat standing up.

04:28.531 --> 04:30.733
As soon as she comes back in,
"Why'd you let him get there?"

04:30.933 --> 04:32.301
But he's always happy to see me.

04:32.501 --> 04:33.670
I come home. The tail is wagging.

04:33.870 --> 04:36.839
He doesn't care how long I've been gone,
where I've been.

04:37.039 --> 04:39.742
So you're saying your wife
isn't happy to see you?

04:39.942 --> 04:45.248
SShe likes me maybe three days
a week when it's payday.

04:46.382 --> 04:48.117
All that aside, it's a bit serious.

04:48.317 --> 04:51.320
"Traing your Dog" segment...
if you have a problem dog,

04:51.520 --> 04:53.456
stick around. You'll want to learn...

04:56.092 --> 04:58.427
And sometimes it works
and sometimes it doesn't.

05:07.403 --> 05:11.741
I've got a pocket full of money

05:11.941 --> 05:14.110
And a heart full of love

05:18.414 --> 05:22.351
I got a pocket full of money, whoo, yes

05:22.551 --> 05:25.021
And a heart full of love

05:28.357 --> 05:31.777
Well, let's cuddle up

05:31.977 --> 05:35.398
And act like a turtledove

05:40.002 --> 05:44.540
Now, I've got a few things
that I want you to do

05:44.740 --> 05:46.943
I just ain't had time, darling...

06:03.626 --> 06:06.028
Check this out.

06:14.003 --> 06:15.705
Holy shit.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.543
Can we get a tarp on this
before it washes away?

06:20.743 --> 06:22.511
Already on its way.

06:34.857 --> 06:37.860
It's registered
to a Mrs. Olivia Trelawney,

06:38.060 --> 06:40.396
1127 Ashley Way, Apartment 19C.

06:40.596 --> 06:41.730
It's in Sugar Heights.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.065
Got a phone number?

06:43.265 --> 06:44.233
I can get one.

06:44.433 --> 06:45.668
Yeah!

06:50.806 --> 06:51.540
No airbag deployment.

06:54.010 --> 06:55.545
He disabled them.

06:55.745 --> 06:57.747
Speaks to premeditation.

06:57.947 --> 07:00.216
Speaks to him knowing how to do it.

07:00.416 --> 07:02.184
You get a whiff?

07:02.384 --> 07:03.519
Ohh!

07:03.719 --> 07:06.505
He must have used
3, 4 gallons of bleach.

07:06.705 --> 07:09.492
This'll be a forensics
fucking deelight.

07:11.994 --> 07:16.448
Well, let's get together

07:16.648 --> 07:21.103
And hug up like a turtledove

07:44.860 --> 07:46.195
Nice.

07:47.863 --> 07:50.433
Yeah.
I'm laying in a hospital bed halfdead.

07:50.633 --> 07:51.467
You two can't be bothered.

07:54.103 --> 07:56.605
Did you take a frigging beat to worry,

07:56.805 --> 07:58.607
show some concern?

07:58.807 --> 08:00.543
I'm sorry.

08:00.743 --> 08:03.145
I'm in oral motor rehabilitation.

08:03.345 --> 08:04.547
I sustained nerve damage.

08:04.747 --> 08:07.049
I got to suck on this 4 hours a day.

08:07.249 --> 08:07.950
DDid they visit?

08:10.753 --> 08:12.121
They're parttimers.

08:12.321 --> 08:14.473
Yeah. Well, us fulltimers thought

08:14.673 --> 08:16.826
that you'd want us to mind the store.

08:23.232 --> 08:24.700
Did you fuck with my computer?

08:26.168 --> 08:27.403
What?

08:27.603 --> 08:28.988
One second, it's working perfect.

08:29.188 --> 08:30.573
The next, it nearly killed me.

08:30.773 --> 08:32.308
That is messed up, Robi.

08:32.508 --> 08:35.277
Seriously, that's almost cruel.

08:36.611 --> 08:38.179
What kind of monster do you think I am?

08:46.188 --> 08:48.090
Sorry. Sorry.

08:48.290 --> 08:52.862
I pride myself on being on time,
which I never am.

08:55.364 --> 08:57.166
Somebody dead?

08:57.366 --> 08:58.034
Sorry?

08:58.234 --> 09:00.336
I see retired people in ties,

09:00.536 --> 09:04.006
my brain immediately goes to funerals.

09:04.206 --> 09:07.676
Well, the tie just means I'm on the job.

09:08.878 --> 09:10.012
Our job.

09:10.212 --> 09:11.147
Yeah.

09:11.347 --> 09:12.548
You want to sit down?

09:12.748 --> 09:15.451
I did go to the storage space.

09:15.651 --> 09:18.354
Turns out he wrote her a letter,

09:18.554 --> 09:21.057
more than one, in fact.

09:21.257 --> 09:22.491
This good?
Yes.

09:30.065 --> 09:34.069
Anybody who intentionally
mows down innocent people

09:34.269 --> 09:35.838
is a sick fuck,

09:36.038 --> 09:38.541
but...

09:38.741 --> 09:40.109
this guy is so much worse.

09:59.228 --> 10:00.463
"Dear Olivia Trelawney..."

10:01.997 --> 10:03.866
"I am the man who stole your Mercedes.

10:04.066 --> 10:05.268
To the public, I am a monster,

10:05.468 --> 10:09.205
but I want you to know
that I am also a human being."

10:09.405 --> 10:11.040
Really? Okay.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.877
I grew up in a physically
and sexually abusive household.

10:15.077 --> 10:18.080
I was bullied at school, laughed at,

10:18.280 --> 10:22.084
and not just by the other kids,
but by teachers, too.

10:22.284 --> 10:24.586
I was never a mean kid, Mrs. Trelawney.

10:24.786 --> 10:26.972
I just tried to get through my childhood

10:27.172 --> 10:29.358
without being laughed at or humiliated.

10:29.558 --> 10:31.861
I did not succeed.

10:32.061 --> 10:33.462
I work in a lowpaying job

10:33.662 --> 10:35.831
and lead what most people
would consider to be

10:36.031 --> 10:38.634
a bad and unremarkable life.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.237
Finally, I began to get angry.

10:41.437 --> 10:43.739
I wanted to strike back at the world

10:43.939 --> 10:46.042
and make the world know I was alive.

10:46.242 --> 10:48.944
"One day, it all got to be too much.
I didn't plan ahead.

10:49.144 --> 10:50.913
I just couldn't take it anymore,
and I..."

10:51.113 --> 10:53.382
This is bullshit.
He thought ahead, planned it.

10:53.582 --> 10:55.251
Mm, keep reading.

10:57.553 --> 10:59.488
"And I did what I did.

10:59.688 --> 11:01.424
I still relive the thuds

11:01.624 --> 11:04.994
that resulted from hitting
all of those people."

11:06.428 --> 11:09.581
"I still hear their screams.

11:09.781 --> 11:12.542
The guilt can be so much,

11:12.742 --> 11:15.074
which makes me think of you.

11:15.274 --> 11:17.406
You must be feeling guilt, too.

11:17.606 --> 11:21.277
After all, had you not left
your keys in the ignition...

11:21.477 --> 11:22.645
So many "ifs."

11:22.845 --> 11:24.113
If I had not been out walking,

11:24.313 --> 11:26.749
suffering from the insomnia that night."

11:26.949 --> 11:29.285
Had you not left the car unlocked,

11:29.485 --> 11:32.254
perhaps none of this
would have happened.

11:32.454 --> 11:35.424
Perhaps those innocent people
would still be alive.

11:35.624 --> 11:40.095
I want you to know,
I feel your anguish, Mrs. Trelawney.

11:40.295 --> 11:41.830
Compassionate little fuck, isn't he?

11:44.099 --> 11:46.635
"After all, we only have each other."

11:46.835 --> 11:50.072
Those innocent people
would still be alive,

11:50.272 --> 11:51.307
but for the two of us.

11:53.042 --> 11:56.445
Crazy as it may seem...

11:56.645 --> 11:59.782
you are the only person
keeping me alive.

12:01.650 --> 12:03.786
Really working her.

12:06.355 --> 12:08.324
"Because you're the only one
who can understand

12:08.524 --> 12:10.259
what it is like to be in hell.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.729
Sincerely, Mr. Mercedes."

12:15.364 --> 12:17.483
Probation? You got to be kidding me.

12:17.683 --> 12:19.602
We don't have a probation policy.

12:19.802 --> 12:22.037
No. He meant it like a warning,
like I could have got fired.

12:22.237 --> 12:24.373
Brady, we run this place.

12:24.573 --> 12:26.342
We make all the service calls.

12:26.542 --> 12:27.276
We work the floor.

12:27.476 --> 12:29.512
Robi doesn't know shit about computers.

12:29.712 --> 12:33.115
He just likes to boss us around
and hold dominion and shit.

12:33.315 --> 12:34.917
Mmph.

12:35.117 --> 12:36.419
What's going on?

12:36.619 --> 12:38.421
Um, just a migraine, stress thing.

12:38.621 --> 12:41.023
I'll be fine.
Yep, stress caused by Robi.

12:41.223 --> 12:42.291
We should report him to OSHA.

12:42.491 --> 12:43.692
Hey, I'll tell you what.

12:43.892 --> 12:45.894
He's always wanting us
to show initiative and shit.

12:46.094 --> 12:48.097
We should tell him
that while he was away at lunch,

12:48.297 --> 12:50.132
we started a human resources department

12:50.332 --> 12:51.967
and reported his fucking ass.

12:54.637 --> 12:56.605
What the fuck?
Who's working the register?

12:56.805 --> 12:58.507
What, you didn't see? I left a note...

12:58.707 --> 13:00.175
please help yourself.

13:01.977 --> 13:04.079
What? Paulie's out there. So is Tayles.

13:04.279 --> 13:05.915
No, no. They're retards. No.

13:06.115 --> 13:08.784
I don't want them working
the register unattended, so.

13:08.984 --> 13:10.586
Yeah. Well, I'm on my break.

13:10.786 --> 13:12.554
You're not.
I'll just be one minute.

13:12.754 --> 13:14.523
He was delayed because of a migraine

13:14.723 --> 13:15.458
brought on by your abuse,

13:15.658 --> 13:17.226
which is currently under investigation

13:17.426 --> 13:18.360
by our new HR wing.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.361
What?

13:19.561 --> 13:21.230
And what's with
the "Man From Glad" getup?

13:21.430 --> 13:23.866
What did I say about you selling
Popsicles during business hours?

13:24.066 --> 13:25.000
I was on break, so personal time.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.135
What are you, a drug dealer, Brady?

13:26.335 --> 13:27.536
Shut up.

13:34.109 --> 13:36.428
What did you say to me?

13:36.628 --> 13:38.947
I'm not a drug dealer.

13:39.147 --> 13:40.282
Uhhuh.

13:40.482 --> 13:42.584
Well, who you selling
ice cream to at lunchtime?

13:42.784 --> 13:44.319
I did a birthday party at a school.

13:44.519 --> 13:45.354
I don't sell drugs, you...

13:52.261 --> 13:54.496
I have had it with you two.

13:58.367 --> 14:01.070
Fuck.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.605
You really okay?

14:02.805 --> 14:05.174
Yeah. It's just a migraine, so.

14:07.242 --> 14:08.677
Go home.

14:08.877 --> 14:10.546
You're allowed to have a sick day.

14:10.746 --> 14:12.848
Just...go home.

14:13.048 --> 14:15.084
I'll deal with Robi.

14:15.284 --> 14:17.453
Thank you.

14:19.555 --> 14:23.926
With each one,
he keeps upping the emotional voltage.

14:24.126 --> 14:26.328
He keeps talking about his guilt,

14:26.528 --> 14:28.363
but he's really trying to...

14:28.563 --> 14:29.598
Uncork hers.

14:29.798 --> 14:31.233
Right.

14:31.433 --> 14:34.269
Well, I mean, the good thing about it is

14:34.469 --> 14:37.106
that this is what
we call "hard evidence."

14:37.306 --> 14:39.608
This is just the kind of thing
the police are looking for.

14:40.876 --> 14:43.245
I have a pretty good nose
for indifference,

14:43.445 --> 14:46.081
and I promise you,
the police don't give a shit.

14:46.281 --> 14:48.117
This is going to end up at the bottom

14:48.317 --> 14:49.218
of a... of a dusty file.

14:49.418 --> 14:51.620
If I don't go forward with this,

14:51.820 --> 14:53.922
I'm withholding evidence,

14:54.122 --> 14:56.025
which is a felony offense.

14:56.225 --> 14:59.161
I'd never get to vote
for President again.

15:00.562 --> 15:01.630
Okay.

15:01.830 --> 15:05.034
Well, I have done some research,

15:05.234 --> 15:10.072
and it seems that P.I.s make around...

15:10.272 --> 15:11.273
$5,000 a week.

15:11.473 --> 15:14.042
And I'm prepared to write
a personal check right now,

15:14.242 --> 15:15.578
make it completely official.

15:15.778 --> 15:18.747
Any communication
or conversations we have

15:18.947 --> 15:21.183
will be deemed work product.

15:21.383 --> 15:22.785
Mm.

15:22.985 --> 15:26.922
Okay.
Ms. Patterson, before I cash your check,

15:27.122 --> 15:31.059
I'm telling you I'm taking
this to the police.

15:31.259 --> 15:33.862
Then we'll see what happens next, okay?

15:34.062 --> 15:35.330
Okay.

15:53.382 --> 15:55.884
Well, I guess news travels fast.
Who told you?

15:56.084 --> 15:57.686
Told me what? I haven't heard shit.

15:57.886 --> 15:59.488
You serious?

16:00.556 --> 16:01.824
Bill, we caught him.

16:04.126 --> 16:05.327
Caught who?

16:05.527 --> 16:07.262
Oh, my God. You really didn't hear.

16:07.462 --> 16:08.931
Donnie Davis.

16:09.131 --> 16:11.433
And get this...
that asshole didn't just kill his wife.

16:11.633 --> 16:13.936
Turns out he's Turnpike Joe.
He killed all those hookers.

16:14.136 --> 16:15.904
We just hit the fucking lottery here.

16:16.104 --> 16:18.473
Oh, that's... that's fantastic.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.843
Jesus, try not to get too excited.

16:21.043 --> 16:23.045
No, no, no. TThat's...
That's great, really.

16:25.113 --> 16:27.316
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:27.516 --> 16:30.619
Yeah. Come on.

16:30.819 --> 16:32.588
So these are the ones he sent to me.

16:32.788 --> 16:34.790
These others are what
led her to suicide.

16:34.990 --> 16:37.259
There's things in there
only the killer could know.

16:37.459 --> 16:39.094
This is not hoax shit.

16:39.294 --> 16:40.462
Okay. Okay.

16:40.662 --> 16:44.533
Bill, great, we'll take it from here.

16:44.733 --> 16:45.534
Private conversation.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.936
Izzy's working the case with me.
It's all right.

16:48.136 --> 16:49.938
Oh, really?
Hi, Bill.

16:50.138 --> 16:52.941
Bill has received some letters
he believes might be pertinent

16:53.141 --> 16:56.245
to the, uh... Mercedes investigation.

16:56.445 --> 16:58.047
Aha.

16:58.247 --> 17:00.049
"Aha"? That's it?

17:00.249 --> 17:02.384
No curiosity as to
what the letters contain?

17:02.584 --> 17:03.185
These are from him.

17:03.385 --> 17:04.953
Bill, how would you know?

17:05.153 --> 17:06.722
And please don't tell me your gut.

17:06.922 --> 17:10.525
Huh? I mean,
this "I was sexually abused and bullied"

17:10.724 --> 17:12.894
boilerplate,
that's particularly him, is it?

17:13.094 --> 17:15.064
And what about the integrity
of this evidence?

17:15.263 --> 17:17.598
How many people have
touched these letters before me?

17:17.799 --> 17:19.351
What's going on here? I'm on your team.

17:19.550 --> 17:21.103
No, Bill. No. You're off the team.

17:21.303 --> 17:22.104
You're retired.

17:24.473 --> 17:26.141
Now, I'm grateful you brought these in.

17:26.340 --> 17:27.959
They'll be reviewed by us and the shrink

17:28.159 --> 17:29.778
and any others who can lend
an expert hand.

17:29.978 --> 17:31.480
Pete, '93 or '94?
'94.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.948
See? There's '94.

17:33.148 --> 17:35.150
Now, I'll...
I'll pull the prints off them.

17:35.350 --> 17:37.085
And once we've ruled out yours and mine

17:37.285 --> 17:38.987
and the sister's and Olivia Trelawney's

17:39.187 --> 17:40.689
and her housekeeper's and the mother's

17:40.889 --> 17:43.025
and any neighbors
they thought to share them with,

17:43.225 --> 17:45.694
I'll see if his are on there, too.
Hmm? When?

17:45.894 --> 17:47.996
When we finish taking
the statement of Donnie Davis.

17:48.196 --> 17:50.299
And then formally charge him
and then take his statement

17:50.499 --> 17:51.200
on the turnpike killings

17:51.400 --> 17:53.035
and then write up all our reports

17:53.235 --> 17:54.770
and then maybe, oh, maybe,

17:54.970 --> 17:56.605
squeeze in, oh, 4 hours of sleep.

17:56.805 --> 17:58.240
Then maybe we reach out to the shrink

17:58.440 --> 18:00.109
who might just point out
how these letters

18:00.309 --> 18:02.411
don't seem all that different
from the 700 others

18:02.611 --> 18:03.879
we received from all over the country

18:04.079 --> 18:06.415
and two from Gstaad claiming
to be the Mercedes Killer.

18:06.615 --> 18:08.283
Is that good enough for you, Bill?

18:08.483 --> 18:10.886
Who the fuck are you?

18:11.086 --> 18:12.354
Don't talk to me that way.

18:12.554 --> 18:14.189
You think there's a game I'm playing?

18:14.389 --> 18:16.825
You think I'm just making
shit up to entertain myself?

18:17.025 --> 18:19.228
This is our guy, 100%.

18:19.428 --> 18:20.829
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't.

18:21.029 --> 18:22.431
How can you be so sure? Hmm?

18:25.300 --> 18:27.169
It's not just the letters, Pete.

18:27.369 --> 18:29.271
Mm?

18:29.471 --> 18:32.207
He sends me messages
through my computer.

18:32.407 --> 18:34.710
Your PC is talking to you?

18:34.910 --> 18:37.913
No. He is talking to me through the PC

18:38.113 --> 18:39.982
or laptop, whatever it is.

18:40.182 --> 18:42.851
I've seen footage from City Center

18:43.051 --> 18:44.453
taken from inside the car.

18:44.653 --> 18:47.022
I mean, it's only a tiny snippet,
but it proves it.

18:47.222 --> 18:48.023
Wait, wait, wait. You...

18:48.223 --> 18:50.325
You got footage of him
running people down?

18:50.525 --> 18:51.794
Yes. I mean, no.

18:51.994 --> 18:54.296
It's like...
He sent it, but I don't have it.

18:54.496 --> 18:56.681
The messages disappear.

18:56.881 --> 18:58.867
The messages disappear?

18:59.067 --> 19:00.536
It's how the site he uses works. Okay?

19:00.736 --> 19:02.871
It's called "Under Debbie's Blue
Umbrella". Bill, Bill, take a breath.

19:03.071 --> 19:04.072
Take a breath, take a breath.

19:08.744 --> 19:11.513
Look. Hey, look...

19:11.713 --> 19:13.448
we'll take a look at all the evidence

19:13.648 --> 19:15.050
still in the physical world.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.819
Meanwhile, why don't...
why don't you go home?

19:22.891 --> 19:26.261
And replay that conversation
we had the other day, man,

19:26.461 --> 19:29.097
because I...don't want
to be having it again.

19:34.770 --> 19:37.773
Bill!

19:40.442 --> 19:42.177
Nobody has got your back more than Pete.

19:42.377 --> 19:43.078
I don't need to tell you that.

19:43.278 --> 19:44.746
Yeah. You're telling me just the same.

19:44.946 --> 19:47.149
You would have been broomed
a full 6 months earlier

19:47.349 --> 19:49.317
had he not had your back.
You're drinking.

19:49.517 --> 19:51.486
You're obsessing with
the Mercedes Killer.

19:51.686 --> 19:53.522
You're still spiraling.

19:55.757 --> 19:57.226
Maybe it's time to get some help.

19:57.426 --> 19:59.928
Fuck you, and Pete, too,
if that's what he thinks.

20:00.128 --> 20:00.996
It's too bad.

20:01.196 --> 20:02.130
You earned the right
to retire with dignity.

20:10.539 --> 20:11.807
The hell is your problem?

20:12.007 --> 20:14.543
My problem is that you two shites

20:14.743 --> 20:16.078
don't watch where you walk.

20:16.278 --> 20:17.946
The fucking union is always complaing

20:18.146 --> 20:19.047
about how dangerous the job is.

20:19.247 --> 20:20.715
Might be less so if
some of the deadbeats

20:20.915 --> 20:22.384
stop waltzing in front
of moving vehicles.

20:22.584 --> 20:23.485
Do you want to be arrested, sir?

20:26.955 --> 20:28.223
On what fucking charge?

20:30.092 --> 20:31.693
Braking for police officers?

20:31.893 --> 20:34.830
Go ahead. Go on, arrest me, lock me up.

20:35.030 --> 20:35.998
And go up and tell Pete Dickson

20:36.198 --> 20:37.432
that you're taking in another stray.

20:37.632 --> 20:39.334
Away wit' ya!

20:39.534 --> 20:41.103
Let's get the fuck out of here. Go.

20:42.871 --> 20:45.307
When did I get so easy
to fucking ignore?

20:50.145 --> 20:53.381
You want to lock me up for that,
assaulting me vehicle?

20:53.581 --> 20:54.182
You better watch yourself.

21:04.359 --> 21:06.011
Jerome.

21:06.211 --> 21:07.663
Jerome? Hmm?

21:07.863 --> 21:09.531
Come on, you promised to help.

21:09.731 --> 21:11.099
Yeah, yeah. I will.

21:11.299 --> 21:13.335
Just let me get this work done first.

21:13.535 --> 21:15.237
You're always working.

21:15.437 --> 21:17.205
Come on, we have to do my posters.

21:17.405 --> 21:18.407
We will. We will.

21:18.607 --> 21:20.609
Seriously, the gala is in 3 weeks.

21:20.809 --> 21:23.545
We got to get this done.
I have work to do, too.

21:23.745 --> 21:26.414
Hey, hey, no, don't be feeding him that.

21:26.614 --> 21:29.284
Chocolate is, like, fatal for a dog.

21:29.484 --> 21:30.619
What?
Yeah.

21:30.819 --> 21:33.321
Oh, Odie, I'm sorry, baby.

21:33.521 --> 21:35.157
You okay?

21:35.357 --> 21:37.459
So, are you going to help or not?

21:37.659 --> 21:38.794
I will.

21:38.994 --> 21:41.663
Let me just get this work done first,
please, Barbara.

21:41.863 --> 21:45.100
You know what? Whatever.
It's always later, huh?

21:45.300 --> 21:48.203
Come on, Odell, let's go.

21:50.639 --> 21:52.641
Ooh.

21:52.841 --> 21:54.142
Hey, Son. What's going on?

21:54.342 --> 21:55.277
What's up, Pop?

21:55.477 --> 21:57.379
What are you working on there?

21:57.579 --> 21:59.581
Just a little project for Mr. Hodges.

21:59.781 --> 22:01.683
Oh, yeah? What might that be?

22:01.883 --> 22:04.753
Uh, I'm not 100% sure.

22:04.953 --> 22:07.589
I think he's trying
to track down some psycho

22:07.789 --> 22:10.425
he couldn't catch while
he was at the department.

22:10.625 --> 22:12.761
I beg your pardon?

22:12.961 --> 22:15.197
You're telling me he's enlisted you

22:15.397 --> 22:16.464
to hunt down some criminal?

22:19.568 --> 22:21.336
Well, you make it sound bad.

22:35.016 --> 22:37.219
Ah, fuck.

23:00.475 --> 23:02.277
Hi, Willie. How are you this morning?

23:02.477 --> 23:03.361
Willie!

23:03.561 --> 23:04.246
Very good.

23:04.446 --> 23:06.047
I have a little surprise.
Close your eyes.

23:06.247 --> 23:07.315
tomorrow.

23:07.515 --> 23:09.250
What's the surprise?

23:09.450 --> 23:11.186
All right, open them.

23:13.255 --> 23:14.256
All right.

23:16.591 --> 23:18.093
That's Willie Whistle.

23:18.293 --> 23:21.062
Okay, let's start with Swee'Pea,
just like Popeye.

23:21.262 --> 23:24.649
C, another C, another backwards C,

23:24.849 --> 23:28.236
another backwards C on the bottom.

23:28.436 --> 23:30.138
A little mouth...

23:30.338 --> 23:31.606
Gerry!

23:36.645 --> 23:39.948
And here is Swee'Pea!

23:40.148 --> 23:41.283
That didn't take too long, did it?

23:43.051 --> 23:45.153
That's right.
Well, a lot of practice, Willie.

23:45.353 --> 23:47.122
If you really want to be this good,

23:47.322 --> 23:48.356
a lot of practice, okay?

23:48.556 --> 23:53.962
C, another C, another C,
a backwards C, a little mouth.

24:06.374 --> 24:07.776
Okay. Mom!

24:07.976 --> 24:11.146
Now we all know Swee'Pea
wears a hat like Popeye.

24:11.346 --> 24:14.516
Mom! So let's make sure we do the hat.

24:14.716 --> 24:16.117
Gerry? Oh, my God.

24:16.317 --> 24:17.719
Gerry, can you talk?

24:17.919 --> 24:19.387
A line...

24:19.587 --> 24:21.790
And another "C"...

24:21.990 --> 24:23.124
Honey, can you talk? Gerry!

24:23.324 --> 24:24.526
My God.

24:24.726 --> 24:26.528
Call 911. Call 911.

24:26.728 --> 24:28.530
Oh, my God. Go!

24:28.730 --> 24:29.998
Go! Hurry!

24:44.846 --> 24:47.215
There you go. You have to pay
your fucking tab tonight,

24:47.415 --> 24:48.283
all right?

24:48.483 --> 24:49.634
Hey, ladies.

24:49.834 --> 24:50.785
Hi.
Hey!

24:50.985 --> 24:52.554
Did you get the pics
I sent from this weekend?

24:52.754 --> 24:54.072
No.
Send them to me.

24:54.272 --> 24:55.782
All right, all right.

24:55.982 --> 24:57.292
'Scuse me. Bartender.

24:57.492 --> 25:00.295
We're a little crazy,
but that's okay.

25:00.495 --> 25:01.162
That's pretty usual for us.

25:01.362 --> 25:03.565
Excuse me.

25:04.966 --> 25:07.235
No way! Oh, yeah.

25:07.435 --> 25:09.704
I was like, "Whaaaat?"

25:12.774 --> 25:14.192
What can I get you?

25:14.392 --> 25:15.610
Another, please.

25:15.810 --> 25:17.979
Another what?
You're so bad.

25:18.179 --> 25:19.247
Another Midleton.

25:19.447 --> 25:20.531
Just keeping it real.

25:20.731 --> 25:21.616
Did you see KDog there?

25:21.816 --> 25:24.152
No, he's on some spiritual cleanse.

25:24.352 --> 25:25.153
You didn't hear?

25:25.353 --> 25:25.954
No.
No.

25:26.154 --> 25:27.138
I didn't hear about that.
Mnhmnh.

25:27.338 --> 25:28.323
I want to do a spiritual cleanse.

25:28.523 --> 25:30.675
You said Bushmills?

25:30.875 --> 25:33.027
No, I said Midleton.

25:33.227 --> 25:34.362
Midleton!

25:43.872 --> 25:44.739
Thank you.

25:44.939 --> 25:46.975
Yeah, no prob'.

25:47.175 --> 25:51.413
What does that mean?

25:51.613 --> 25:54.149
What? It means "no problem."

25:54.349 --> 25:57.385
Yeah, I'm fully aware there's no problem

25:57.585 --> 26:01.689
that you serve me a drink
I pay an exorbitant price for.

26:01.889 --> 26:04.191
Part of that exorbitance
goes to your salary

26:04.391 --> 26:06.644
for you to pay your rent
and go on Shit Tweet

26:06.844 --> 26:09.097
or Facefuck or Arsebook
or whatever you call it.

26:10.198 --> 26:12.100
The proper response to my "Thank you"

26:12.300 --> 26:13.635
is not "No problem."

26:13.835 --> 26:17.572
It's... It's, like, "You're welcome,"

26:17.772 --> 26:19.641
or "My pleasure," even.

26:19.841 --> 26:22.644
My what?

26:22.844 --> 26:26.681
"No problem"
implies that serving a customer

26:26.881 --> 26:29.451
what he pays for could be a problem.

26:29.651 --> 26:33.721
It shouldn't be a problem unless
you're the fucking problem.

26:33.921 --> 26:35.090
Hey, sir,

26:35.290 --> 26:38.059
if you continue to use abusive
and inappropriate language...

26:38.259 --> 26:41.062
I'm not being inappropriate,
I'm being an arsehole.

26:41.262 --> 26:43.932
Whereas you are being more of a cunt.

26:48.069 --> 26:49.604
Okay.

26:49.804 --> 26:53.174
We didn't say "inappropriate" in my day.

26:53.374 --> 26:56.744
We said, "Yes, sir," or, "No, ma'am,"

26:56.944 --> 26:58.480
or, "You're welcome."

26:58.680 --> 27:00.148
We helped neighbors shovel their walks.

27:00.348 --> 27:03.551
We opened doors for women.

27:03.751 --> 27:06.421
We didn't think everything
was fucking relative.

27:12.627 --> 27:16.764
We actually thought
that principles mattered.

27:16.964 --> 27:19.901
Manners mattered.

27:20.101 --> 27:24.205
Doing your fucking job right mattered.

27:24.405 --> 27:25.323
I'll call the police, man.

27:25.523 --> 27:26.441
You "call the police," man.

27:26.641 --> 27:28.476
They won't come, man.

27:28.676 --> 27:30.312
You don't get it.

27:30.512 --> 27:31.579
We're all on your own.

27:31.779 --> 27:33.081
They tell you the opposite, of course,

27:33.281 --> 27:36.017
so we won't storm the castle.

27:36.217 --> 27:37.886
The sad fucking fact of the matter

27:38.086 --> 27:43.024
is,
they'll just build their hills higher

27:43.224 --> 27:44.359
and their walls thicker

27:44.559 --> 27:47.595
and leave us all to drown
in the fucking flood.

27:50.098 --> 27:52.600
Let's go, Bill.

27:55.937 --> 27:58.640
Who the fuck called you?

27:58.840 --> 28:01.543
Come on, time to go.

28:05.079 --> 28:06.281
Bill.

28:15.323 --> 28:17.692
These are for you.

28:17.892 --> 28:20.094
No problem.

28:22.297 --> 28:24.265
Oh!
Oh!

28:24.465 --> 28:25.967
I'll drink to that.

28:28.202 --> 28:29.037
My car's over this way.

28:29.237 --> 28:30.739
You're not going anywhere near it.

28:30.939 --> 28:35.109
You... You haven't heard
a fucking word I told you.

28:35.309 --> 28:36.527
Heard them all, drove me to drink.

28:36.727 --> 28:37.746
I figured if I was half-trousered,

28:37.946 --> 28:39.214
I might make sense out of some of them.

28:39.414 --> 28:42.250
Bill, you think you're the
first cop to go down this path?

28:42.450 --> 28:44.585
Being retired doesn't
make you irrelevant.

28:44.785 --> 28:46.721
Being a piece of shit drunk
very much does,

28:46.921 --> 28:49.190
and I'm not gonna...
Although being a piece of shit detective

28:49.390 --> 28:52.527
that walks around not seeing,
not talking... Fuck you.

28:52.727 --> 28:54.329
I'm talking now!

28:54.529 --> 28:57.465
This case destroyed you on the job,
Bill.

28:57.665 --> 28:58.933
Hell, it cost you your job.

28:59.133 --> 29:01.102
You lost yourself.

29:01.302 --> 29:04.655
Be it booze, depression,
you're out of control.

29:04.855 --> 29:07.266
Being halftrousered,
I'm a little nauseous,

29:07.466 --> 29:09.877
so you should know that
you're standing well

29:10.077 --> 29:12.614
within my projectile vomit range.

29:14.449 --> 29:16.184
Where does this end?

29:16.384 --> 29:19.387
With the case? When I get him.

29:19.587 --> 29:21.889
With you? Looks like it already has.

29:25.827 --> 29:27.428
Fuck.

30:08.799 --> 30:10.601
Okay.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.142
And here we go.

30:20.577 --> 30:21.745
Hey, how you doing out there?

30:21.945 --> 30:23.113
I know who you are. You see me.

30:23.313 --> 30:24.215
I see you. Yeah.

30:24.415 --> 30:25.916
But you're in a bathing suit,

30:26.116 --> 30:28.735
and you get along still pretty
well after a couple children?

30:28.935 --> 30:31.555
I mean, I can't say I like going
to try on the bathing suits.

30:31.755 --> 30:33.223
But, yeah,
I can get in the gym and make it...

30:33.423 --> 30:35.292
Make it...

30:35.492 --> 30:37.561
Greetings, Detective.

30:37.761 --> 30:39.697
I guess you're sill alive.

30:39.897 --> 30:41.298
Though that gun's gotta be looking

30:41.498 --> 30:43.667
pretty appetizing right now.

30:43.867 --> 30:45.836
You say you want to play.

30:46.036 --> 30:48.405
What do fat old fucks like to play?

30:48.605 --> 30:52.276
How 'bout we pretend
you're still a detective?

30:52.476 --> 30:54.778
Have you found any good clues yet?

30:54.978 --> 30:56.280
Or do you just bumble around

30:56.480 --> 30:59.450
like an old fart deep up his ass?

31:01.385 --> 31:02.887
Whoa!

31:03.087 --> 31:05.205
Now your head's up my ass.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.324
And it feels good, baby!

31:07.524 --> 31:10.461
Move it around a little, make it squirm.

31:10.661 --> 31:11.495
Oh, yeah, baby.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.780
Oh, yeah, baby, just like that.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.066
Oh, my God, you're an animal.

31:16.266 --> 31:17.334
Use that tongue some.

31:17.534 --> 31:18.752
Hard.

31:18.952 --> 31:20.295
Oh, yes.

31:20.495 --> 31:21.639
Oh, my.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.174
Fuck, that's different. Oh, yeah.

31:24.374 --> 31:25.876
Jesus, fuck. Ida?!

31:26.076 --> 31:26.877
Oh, God!

31:28.178 --> 31:29.747
I'm not in the mood, Ida!

31:47.431 --> 31:48.699
Who is it?

31:53.303 --> 31:54.772
Mr. Hodges.

31:54.972 --> 31:56.907
Lawrence Robinson, Jerome's father.

31:57.107 --> 31:57.908
We met once before.

31:58.108 --> 32:00.578
Oh, yeah.

32:00.778 --> 32:01.845
How you doin'?

32:02.045 --> 32:02.913
Been better.

32:03.113 --> 32:05.532
You, um, expecting somebody?

32:05.732 --> 32:07.826
You never know. C'mon in.

32:08.026 --> 32:09.920
That won't be necessary.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.522
Jerome tells me he's helping you catch

32:11.722 --> 32:14.658
some fugitive of the law.

32:14.858 --> 32:16.060
No. Not at all.

32:16.260 --> 32:20.130
He's just giving me
some I.T. assistance.

32:20.330 --> 32:23.267
Uhhuh.

32:23.467 --> 32:25.703
You seem upset.

32:25.903 --> 32:28.489
My son... My son has a 4.2 GPA.

32:28.689 --> 32:31.075
He's never been in trouble,

32:31.275 --> 32:33.410
got his whole future by the balls.

32:33.610 --> 32:35.279
An amazing kid,

32:35.479 --> 32:36.714
which is a bit of a miracle,

32:36.914 --> 32:38.482
given fatherhood scared
the piss out of me.

32:41.285 --> 32:45.088
My point is, I jumped through
every goddamn hoop known to man

32:45.288 --> 32:47.358
to give that boy his best shot.

32:47.558 --> 32:50.761
"Just don't fuck it up"
has pretty much been my mantra.

32:50.961 --> 32:52.696
A while back, it dawned on me.

32:52.896 --> 32:55.599
It might not be me who fucks Jerome up.

32:55.799 --> 33:02.172
Could be anybody...
a schoolteacher, buddy, girl.

33:02.372 --> 33:04.408
World's full of people
to fuck things up.

33:04.608 --> 33:08.378
So I'm here to ask you a question,
Mr. Hodges.

33:08.578 --> 33:10.781
Are you that guy?

33:13.016 --> 33:14.251
I'll try not to fuck up your son.

33:19.356 --> 33:23.060
Heard about what happened
the other night.

33:23.260 --> 33:26.263
You outside with the gun.

33:26.463 --> 33:30.367
And my concern is, you're not well.

33:30.567 --> 33:31.435
Is anybody?

33:31.635 --> 33:34.805
That meant to be funny?

33:35.005 --> 33:36.874
No, sir.

33:39.977 --> 33:43.113
I'd never do anything
to jeopardize Jerome.

33:43.313 --> 33:44.048
You have a fine son.

33:44.248 --> 33:45.883
Truth be told, I'm quite fond of him.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.819
But your point is taken.

33:51.054 --> 33:52.222
Thank you.

33:52.422 --> 33:54.892
Enjoy your evening.

34:39.436 --> 34:41.038
"To whom it may concern"...

34:43.873 --> 34:45.208
"...I'd like to address you

34:45.409 --> 34:49.947
as 'Mr. Mercedes,' but,
alas, the jig is up.

34:50.147 --> 34:52.416
We've had a new development.

34:52.616 --> 34:56.553
It delights me to inform
that at approximately 11 a.m.

34:56.753 --> 34:59.022
this morning, the actual Mercedes killer

34:59.222 --> 35:00.791
was taken into custody.

35:00.991 --> 35:02.860
It has not been released to the public.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.329
The police are awaiting
further corroboration,

35:05.529 --> 35:08.115
but, given our special relationship,

35:08.315 --> 35:10.901
I thought I'd give you the heads up."

35:11.101 --> 35:13.203
That's funny. That's funny.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.006
"His name is Donald Davis.

35:16.206 --> 35:18.508
Today's press release
will pertain to the homicide

35:18.708 --> 35:21.278
attributed to Turnpike Joe.

35:21.478 --> 35:23.847
Being withheld from today's
press conference

35:24.047 --> 35:25.048
is the subject's confession

35:25.248 --> 35:27.084
regarding the jobs fair massacre.

35:27.284 --> 35:29.253
But we know him to be the assailant...

35:29.453 --> 35:31.455
He had details that
only the actual killer

35:31.655 --> 35:33.490
could have had.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.692
Police expect to announce that the case

35:35.892 --> 35:36.894
is closed by the end of the week,

35:37.094 --> 35:40.797
which reduces you to what
I already suspected you to be...

35:40.997 --> 35:42.298
a fraud.

35:42.498 --> 35:43.816
A pretender.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.335
A nothing.

35:48.071 --> 35:52.676
So please don't waste any more
of your energy, or my time.

35:52.876 --> 35:55.078
I'll go about my retirement.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.048
And you can perhaps move on.

35:58.248 --> 36:01.018
Good night, Mr. Nothing."

36:03.954 --> 36:08.192
Dead fuck.

36:08.392 --> 36:14.297
You stupid, fat, dead fuck.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.270
Fuck.

36:28.278 --> 36:30.964
That fuck...

36:31.164 --> 36:33.650
fucking with me.

36:33.850 --> 36:35.318
She was in some discomfort,

36:35.518 --> 36:36.987
so we had to give her a sedative.

36:37.187 --> 36:38.789
She might be out for a bit.

36:38.989 --> 36:39.857
We can wait.

36:40.057 --> 36:41.525
Or we could come back
another time maybe.

36:44.394 --> 36:47.998
Waiting's good.

36:48.198 --> 36:51.802
She looks so frail.

36:52.002 --> 36:52.903
Yeah.

36:53.103 --> 36:55.706
Ollie took such good care of her.

36:55.906 --> 36:57.858
You can really see the decline since...
Yeah.

36:58.058 --> 37:00.010
Do you think maybe
we could wait in the hall?

37:04.481 --> 37:07.384
What's the matter?

37:07.584 --> 37:09.019
Nothing.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.595
I got some condition.

37:18.795 --> 37:20.163
It's not posttraumatic.

37:20.363 --> 37:24.034
It's...seein'
dead people puts me on a little tilt.

37:24.234 --> 37:26.436
Thanks.

37:26.636 --> 37:27.671
I realize your mother isn't dead,

37:27.871 --> 37:29.239
but she was looking
the part pretty good,

37:32.442 --> 37:34.778
One of the other consequences
of that night.

37:34.978 --> 37:37.180
There was so much death. It was carnage.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.050
I can't imagine.

37:46.857 --> 37:48.725
Did you sister talk much of it?

37:48.925 --> 37:51.411
The guilt?

37:51.611 --> 37:53.897
Not to me.

37:54.097 --> 37:58.702
Truth be told,
I don't know that she felt much guilt.

37:58.902 --> 38:03.240
I think she felt oppressed by the end.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.908
Blamed.

38:05.108 --> 38:08.745
I don't know that she
really felt guilty.

38:08.945 --> 38:10.781
A man stole her car. Yeah.

38:10.981 --> 38:13.884
Yeah, it's just if she hadn't
left the keys in the ignition...

38:14.084 --> 38:15.018
She didn't.

38:15.218 --> 38:16.686
Hmm?

38:18.488 --> 38:19.906
He said it in the letters.

38:20.106 --> 38:21.325
I don't care what he said.

38:21.525 --> 38:24.327
He was just fucking with her mind.

38:24.527 --> 38:27.064
My sister was many things,

38:27.264 --> 38:29.700
honest and fastidious being two.

38:29.900 --> 38:34.137
It's completely unlike her
to leave her keys in her car.

38:34.337 --> 38:37.123
And if she said she didn't, she didn't.

38:37.323 --> 38:40.110
You're really convinced about that?

38:40.310 --> 38:41.311
A hundred percent.

38:41.511 --> 38:44.381
It's just...

38:46.583 --> 38:49.085
the car door wasn't jimmied
or hotwired or anything.

38:49.285 --> 38:50.187
She didn't leave her keys
in the ignition.

38:55.192 --> 38:56.326
Are we having a fight?

38:59.696 --> 39:02.465
I didn't really like
your sister very much.

39:02.665 --> 39:04.884
I found her a bit cold.

39:05.084 --> 39:07.304
There's no need to explain.

39:07.504 --> 39:10.607
You didn't like her.

39:10.807 --> 39:12.676
Guess we are having a fight.

39:16.479 --> 39:19.416
I didn't much like her, either.

39:19.616 --> 39:21.418
I loved her, quite dearly.

39:21.618 --> 39:25.755
Liking her proved much more difficult.

39:41.104 --> 39:42.806
Hey, boss.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.708
How you doing today?

39:46.910 --> 39:48.378
Told you I hate dogs.
Especially this one.

39:50.313 --> 39:52.649
So, listen, I did some digging

39:52.849 --> 39:54.985
into Under Debbie's Blue Umbrella.

39:55.185 --> 39:59.155
Definitely not a straw man,
more like a... a Yeti.

39:59.355 --> 40:00.323
A what?

40:00.523 --> 40:01.291
A Yeti?

40:01.491 --> 40:03.060
Abominable Snowman.

40:03.260 --> 40:05.061
Okay, look, whatever.
Call it what you will.

40:05.261 --> 40:06.463
What I'm saying is, this umbrella thing

40:06.663 --> 40:07.531
is a monster, man.

40:07.731 --> 40:08.799
It's locked up like Fort Knox.

40:08.999 --> 40:10.367
I've been trying to get in, but I can't.

40:10.567 --> 40:11.902
Shit. Yeah.

40:12.102 --> 40:14.571
Listen, Jerome. The...

40:14.771 --> 40:17.474
Your old man was by to see me.

40:17.674 --> 40:18.508
What? Yeah.

40:18.708 --> 40:19.810
He's concerned... rightly so...

40:20.010 --> 40:21.745
that I've maybe got you
mixed up in something dangerous.

40:21.945 --> 40:23.346
Oh.

40:23.546 --> 40:24.897
Well, do you?

40:25.097 --> 40:26.249
Could be.

40:26.449 --> 40:29.286
Possibly about to become more so.

40:29.486 --> 40:31.221
Best to stay away for the time being,
all right?

40:31.421 --> 40:33.757
Um...oh.

40:33.957 --> 40:35.659
Well, who's gonna mow your lawn, then?

40:35.859 --> 40:38.595
Oh. Was thinking of getting
it paved over anyway.

40:38.795 --> 40:41.531
Well, unless you're planning
on not communicating

40:41.731 --> 40:43.216
with whoever this mystery person is...

40:43.416 --> 40:44.901
I mean, you need I.T. help, Mr. Hodges.

40:45.101 --> 40:46.336
Come on.

40:46.536 --> 40:48.038
Well, I won't be getting it from you.

40:48.238 --> 40:50.240
I mean it. What?!

40:50.440 --> 40:52.242
Oh, come on. Not even a hug?

40:52.442 --> 40:54.577
One hug?

40:58.415 --> 41:00.383
Okay. I'll settle for a Chipwich.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.518
Come on, one Chipwich.

41:04.454 --> 41:06.856
Ha. Thank you.

41:07.056 --> 41:09.008
Yo.

41:09.208 --> 41:13.130
Hey!

41:13.330 --> 41:15.598
What the fuck?

41:20.637 --> 41:22.205
Probably some drug dealer,

41:22.405 --> 41:23.773
knows you're an excop.

41:23.973 --> 41:27.243
But, hey,
sugar's probably worse than drugs.

41:27.443 --> 41:28.211
I'll catch you, Mr. Hodges.

41:59.709 --> 42:01.644
Nothing?

42:01.844 --> 42:03.963
No, not a chirp.

42:04.163 --> 42:06.082
I'm surprised.

42:06.282 --> 42:11.154
Maybe he's plotting a...
a proper response, or...

42:11.354 --> 42:13.656
Or? Or what?

42:13.856 --> 42:15.758
Or it's not him.

42:15.958 --> 42:17.861
And the game's over.

42:18.061 --> 42:19.596
No. It's him.

42:23.299 --> 42:25.402
It has to be him.

42:25.602 --> 42:28.171
We're both a bit desperate for that,
aren't we?

42:28.371 --> 42:31.141
Oh, yes, you are

42:31.341 --> 42:34.677
What are we up to here? You and me?

42:34.877 --> 42:38.214
Something happened, something big

42:38.414 --> 42:40.683
Happened to me that day

42:40.883 --> 42:42.953
Sorry? What do you mean?

42:43.153 --> 42:46.673
It's not like we're
on a dogood mission.

42:46.873 --> 42:50.193
It's more like we're settling a score.

42:50.393 --> 42:52.462
Take a killer off the street,
it does a lot of good.

42:52.662 --> 42:54.664
That's not why we're doing it.

42:54.864 --> 42:55.765
We're not trying to help.

42:55.965 --> 43:00.303
It's like we both
have vengeance on the brain.

43:00.503 --> 43:01.604
Nothing wrong with a little vengeance.

43:01.804 --> 43:03.873
Oh, yes, you are

43:04.073 --> 43:05.642
Ain't just love makes
the world go round.

43:08.478 --> 43:10.980
You love anybody, Bill?

43:15.084 --> 43:16.719
Feels like we're changing the subject.

43:20.090 --> 43:22.092
Tell me about your family.

43:22.292 --> 43:24.294
Why did you leave Ireland?

43:25.328 --> 43:28.531
'Cause I wanted to.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.867
I mean, II don't have a family.

43:31.067 --> 43:32.035
What about your ex-wife?

43:32.235 --> 43:33.253
What happened there?

43:33.453 --> 43:34.471
Creative differences.

43:38.608 --> 43:40.677
And your daughter?

43:43.546 --> 43:47.617
Something sad, something blue

43:47.817 --> 43:51.888
Something lost, something I found

43:52.088 --> 43:54.891
Since my woman put me down

43:55.091 --> 43:55.992
Do you know...

43:56.192 --> 43:59.128
do you think it would be possible

43:59.328 --> 44:02.065
your mother might rebound tomorrow?

44:02.265 --> 44:05.235
I really want to know
what Olivia told her, you know?

44:05.435 --> 44:07.904
Well...

44:08.104 --> 44:11.541
overdue for a good day.

44:11.741 --> 44:12.825
We can go back.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.110
Good, good.

44:27.357 --> 44:29.125
When was the last time you danced?

44:29.325 --> 44:32.395
I danced?

44:32.595 --> 44:35.064
Seven... The '70s.

44:38.568 --> 44:41.104
I think you're long overdue.

44:41.871 --> 44:44.441
Come on.

44:44.641 --> 44:47.193
Let's have a dance. Come on.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.946
you must face them alone

44:50.146 --> 44:51.814
Please.

44:54.217 --> 44:58.071
Please remember

44:58.271 --> 45:01.925
I still want you

45:02.125 --> 45:08.064
And in case you wonder why

45:08.264 --> 45:12.369
Well, just wake up

45:12.569 --> 45:18.575
Kiss the good life goodbye

45:18.775 --> 45:20.777
Brady?

45:20.977 --> 45:22.145
Honey?

45:31.287 --> 45:33.122
It's a bad one, isn't it?

45:33.322 --> 45:35.591
Like a vise.

45:35.791 --> 45:37.861
Oh, baby.

45:38.061 --> 45:40.263
Come here. Come to Mama, honey boy.

45:40.463 --> 45:41.131
Come here.

45:41.331 --> 45:45.068
Baby. Come here.

45:45.268 --> 45:47.103
Come on.

45:50.373 --> 45:55.612
<i>Oh, the good life</i>

45:55.812 --> 45:58.748
<i>Full of fun, seems to be</i>

45:58.948 --> 46:01.651
<i>The ideal</i>

46:01.851 --> 46:04.354
<i>Ahh, ahh, ahh</i>

46:04.554 --> 46:09.159
<i>Yes, the good life</i>

46:09.359 --> 46:14.897
<i>Lets you hide all the sadness you feel</i>

46:18.968 --> 46:23.039
<i>Mama's gonna make it better.</i>

46:23.239 --> 46:27.310
<i>You won't really fall in love</i>

46:27.510 --> 46:32.782
<i>For you can't the chance</i>

46:32.982 --> 46:37.153
<i>So be honest</i>

46:37.353 --> 46:41.324
<i>With yourself</i>

46:41.524 --> 46:47.664
<i>Don't try to fake romance</i>

46:47.864 --> 46:52.368
<i>It's the good life</i>

46:52.568 --> 46:58.408
<i>To be free and explore the unknown</i>

47:03.179 --> 47:06.549
<i>Like the heartaches</i>

47:06.749 --> 47:13.423
<i>When you learn you must face them alone</i>

47:17.627 --> 47:21.297
<i>Please remember</i>

47:21.497 --> 47:24.968
<i>I still want you</i>

47:25.168 --> 47:31.174
<i>And in case you wonder why</i>

47:31.374 --> 47:35.411
<i>Well, just wake up</i>

47:35.611 --> 47:43.319
<i>Kiss the good life goodbye</i>

48:29.132 --> 48:32.885
<i>Please remember</i>

48:33.085 --> 48:36.639
<i>I still want you</i>

48:36.839 --> 48:42.845
<i>And in case you wonder why</i>

48:43.045 --> 48:47.166
<i>Well, just wake up</i>

48:47.366 --> 48:51.487
<i>Kiss the good life</i>

48:51.687 --> 48:59.128
<i>Goodbye</i>
