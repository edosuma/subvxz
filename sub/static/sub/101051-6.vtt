WEBVTT

01:24.017 --> 01:26.023
[crying softly]

02:16.019 --> 02:17.007
Holy shit.

02:19.020 --> 02:22.006
-They're dead.
-[woman sobbing] No!

02:23.012 --> 02:25.012
No!

02:25.014 --> 02:26.006
Oh, my God.

02:29.022 --> 02:31.005
[woman continues sobbing] No!

02:35.018 --> 02:39.019
[Niles] Dorothy.
Rise and shine.

02:40.010 --> 02:41.019
Dorothy?

02:52.002 --> 02:53.002
Dorothy?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.011
[Cliff] Chief,
we got a live one.

02:57.013 --> 02:59.002
Fresh off the knuckle.

03:00.018 --> 03:02.003
What the hell
were you thinking?

03:02.005 --> 03:04.007
I'm thinking this
perfectly good touching stick

03:04.009 --> 03:06.009
is my ticket
to being able to feel.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.010
We agreed. No brutality.

03:08.012 --> 03:09.016
And I agreed, but this finger

03:09.018 --> 03:11.012
literally fell into my lap.

03:11.014 --> 03:14.022
See I was waiting
for Vic to man up
and get his lady friend back,

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
and out of nowhere
come these two bad guys.

03:16.002 --> 03:18.017
So I'm like, "What would
a good person do?"

03:18.019 --> 03:19.020
Stop the bad guys, right?

03:19.022 --> 03:21.010
Which I proceeded to do.

03:21.012 --> 03:23.009
It's important that before
I tell you about the car door,

03:23.011 --> 03:24.021
you understand that
I'm basically a hero.

03:24.023 --> 03:27.003
I don't give a damn, Cliff.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.005
Dorothy's missing.

03:29.007 --> 03:31.021
Table the finger
and help me find her.

03:41.018 --> 03:43.017
Hang tight, little guy.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.011
You're sure
we weren't followed?

04:03.019 --> 04:04.004
Not really.

04:06.016 --> 04:09.019
The Bureau of Normalcy seems
to be everywhere these days.

04:13.016 --> 04:14.019
I'm sorry my son
sold us out.

04:14.021 --> 04:18.008
Why are you apologizing?
You were trying to make amends.

04:18.010 --> 04:20.019
And apparently, they'd all be
better off if I were dead.

04:20.021 --> 04:22.008
Well, that may be true,

04:24.002 --> 04:25.006
but I would be bereft.

04:39.005 --> 04:43.011
-You're not coming home?
-I, uh, have a commitment...

04:43.013 --> 04:45.017
in town.

04:45.019 --> 04:47.007
-Really?
-Yes.

04:47.009 --> 04:49.008
I need to purchase
street clothes...

04:51.013 --> 04:52.013
for a rehearsal...

04:53.011 --> 04:54.006
of <i>Our Town...</i>

04:55.004 --> 04:56.023
by the Cloverton Players.

04:57.001 --> 04:58.016
Community theater, huh?

04:58.018 --> 04:59.007
Well, go ahead and say it.

04:59.009 --> 05:01.001
I'm a vain, selfish person

05:01.003 --> 05:03.008
who'd rather chase fame
than support you

05:03.010 --> 05:04.020
in your time of need.

05:04.022 --> 05:07.008
First, I'm not
in a time of need.

05:07.010 --> 05:10.004
I'm in a time of regret
and self-loathing.

05:10.006 --> 05:12.008
Second, I doubt it's fame
you're chasing

05:12.010 --> 05:14.004
by joining
the Cloverton Players.

05:14.006 --> 05:17.012
They're very well-reviewed
in the <i>Cloverton Bugle.</i>

05:17.014 --> 05:18.022
Well, break a leg.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.019
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

05:23.022 --> 05:26.006
Right.
[clears throat]

05:29.014 --> 05:30.016
Oh.

05:30.018 --> 05:31.022
-Oops.
-[laughs]

05:32.000 --> 05:34.021
Well, I was going to tell you
to come back to bed, but...

05:34.023 --> 05:37.010
looks like you beat me to it.

05:37.012 --> 05:39.019
Mmm. Taking advantage
of the disabled.

05:39.021 --> 05:40.021
[whispers] Class act.

05:40.023 --> 05:43.013
Let's stay in today.

05:43.015 --> 05:44.019
I'm sorry, Vic.

05:44.021 --> 05:45.021
But I live in the real world,

05:45.023 --> 05:48.009
and us normals without
a S.T.A.R. Lab credit card

05:48.011 --> 05:51.021
have to come up with rent,
buy food,

05:51.023 --> 05:55.009
and pay off years
of medical stuff.

05:55.011 --> 05:57.009
I get it. What kind
of medical stuff?

05:58.006 --> 06:01.001
PT from botched
corrective surgeries,

06:01.003 --> 06:03.006
pain meds, PTSD meds,
anxiety meds,

06:03.008 --> 06:06.017
which, apparently,
are different from PTSD meds.

06:06.019 --> 06:09.001
Sounds expensive.

06:09.003 --> 06:09.022
Cost of doing business
with black ops.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.008
But don't you worry.

06:11.010 --> 06:14.011
I'll die long before
I have to pay it all off.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.006
Hey.

06:23.022 --> 06:24.008
Can I look inside of you?

06:26.015 --> 06:28.017
-Ew.
-To see what's broken, I mean.

06:28.019 --> 06:30.008
[chuckles]
A hundred times "ew."

06:30.010 --> 06:32.012
There's gotta be a better way
to ask that.

06:32.014 --> 06:33.010
Look...

06:33.012 --> 06:35.005
All this crap
you're dealing with

06:35.007 --> 06:36.007
is because they ripped the tech
out of you, right?

06:36.009 --> 06:38.001
-Right.
-Well, I happen to know

06:38.003 --> 06:38.020
something about the line
where tech meets flesh.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.009
If I could do a deep scan,

06:40.011 --> 06:42.015
I could figure out how to
relieve some of your pain.

06:48.011 --> 06:50.008
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.017
[chuckles] There's gotta be
a better way to say that.

06:52.019 --> 06:54.002
[both laugh]

06:54.004 --> 06:56.002
You can scan my guts if...

06:56.004 --> 06:58.011
you tell me about your PTSD.

06:58.013 --> 07:00.021
All the gory details
you're too chicken shit

07:00.023 --> 07:01.012
to share in group.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.012
Maybe you should
go back to work.

07:04.014 --> 07:05.019
[chuckles] You're such
an asshole.

07:05.021 --> 07:07.021
Okay. Deal.

07:07.023 --> 07:09.006
-Deal?
-Yeah.

07:09.008 --> 07:12.015
You're gonna tell my boss
I got a fever?

07:12.017 --> 07:14.002
Mmm-hmm.

07:14.004 --> 07:15.013
You're gonna cough up
a day's wages?

07:17.023 --> 07:19.002
Are you gonna do the...

07:19.004 --> 07:21.014
-other thing you do?
-Hmm.

07:21.016 --> 07:24.012
-You like that thing, huh?
-I like that thing.

07:33.013 --> 07:34.012
[rumbling]

07:35.021 --> 07:37.014
What the hell?

07:43.009 --> 07:46.014
Yoo-hoo. Any pigtailed pains
in the ass down here?

07:48.017 --> 07:50.018
Jane?

07:50.020 --> 07:52.004
Oh, shit!

07:53.003 --> 07:55.006
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

07:55.021 --> 07:58.018
[gasps] Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!

07:58.020 --> 08:00.010
Oh, shit.

08:00.012 --> 08:02.008
Chief!

08:02.010 --> 08:04.009
There's something wrong
with Jane.

08:08.005 --> 08:11.004
-Where was she?
-The basement.

08:11.006 --> 08:12.011
Was Dorothy with her?

08:12.013 --> 08:14.006
[Cliff] No! Nobody cares
about Dorothy!

08:14.008 --> 08:15.007
Jane was in the basement,
covered in this shit.

08:15.009 --> 08:18.022
-Are you gonna help?
-She's breathing.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.011
[Cliff]
What the fuck happened?

08:20.013 --> 08:24.004
-She was with Dorothy.
-That's not an answer!

08:25.010 --> 08:27.019
This is Dorothy's doing.
But why?

08:27.021 --> 08:30.003
Your daughter did this,
and that's all you got?

08:30.005 --> 08:32.012
What about all this wax?

08:32.014 --> 08:33.010
All you talk about is how
your dumb girl's

08:33.012 --> 08:36.005
gonna end the world,
but you have no idea

08:36.007 --> 08:39.008
how Jane ended up
in a fucking coma?

08:39.010 --> 08:41.001
[Larry] Hey, what's going on?

08:41.003 --> 08:42.017
-[Cliff] Dorothy put Jane
in a coma.
-Have you seen her?

08:42.019 --> 08:44.007
Oh, no.

08:44.009 --> 08:46.013
But there's something else
you should see.

08:46.015 --> 08:49.005
Is it Dorothy playing dress-up
with Rita's skin?

08:49.007 --> 08:52.014
No, no.
There's a spaceship outside.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.002
Tell them I'm not here.

09:03.004 --> 09:04.009
[Cliff] What?

09:04.011 --> 09:06.019
Hey. Where do you think
you're going?

09:06.021 --> 09:07.010
I need to find Dorothy.

09:07.012 --> 09:09.002
Wait, Niles, slow down.

09:09.004 --> 09:09.015
Do you know these guys?

09:11.012 --> 09:14.019
In 1955, the Bureau
gave me funding

09:14.021 --> 09:16.010
for my Immortus initiative,

09:16.012 --> 09:19.002
which included sending
a research team into space.

09:19.004 --> 09:21.013
-To do what?
-Research.

09:23.012 --> 09:26.007
I lost contact with them
in the early '60s

09:26.009 --> 09:29.014
and assumed they were dead.
Apparently, they're not.

09:29.016 --> 09:31.005
And their timing
couldn't be worse.

09:31.007 --> 09:32.021
What, so, I should just
send them away?

09:32.023 --> 09:34.006
No!

09:34.008 --> 09:34.015
Keep them here.

09:36.011 --> 09:39.014
Don't ask me.
I don't fucking know.

09:40.016 --> 09:43.011
-[footsteps receding]
-[sighs]

09:46.020 --> 09:48.003
Hello.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.008
Welcome back... to Earth.

09:52.018 --> 09:53.015
I'm Larry Trainor.

09:55.022 --> 09:58.011
-And you are...
-[laughs]

09:58.020 --> 10:00.013
Who are we?

10:00.015 --> 10:04.008
-We are...
-[together] The Pioneers
of the Uncharted.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.011
Earth's best and brightest,

10:05.013 --> 10:06.023
assembled by benevolent genius,

10:07.001 --> 10:08.005
Niles Caulder.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.005
To pilot
the space vessel <i>Icarus</i>

10:09.007 --> 10:12.005
on a three-generations
mission...

10:12.007 --> 10:14.021
Into the deepest reaches
of the unknown.

10:14.023 --> 10:17.006
Pioneers, roll call.

10:18.017 --> 10:21.018
The name's Zip. Hotshot pilot,
nothing scares me.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.000
-[chuckles] Except marriage.
-The name's Specs.

10:24.002 --> 10:26.015
I'm the brains of the op
and a heartbreaker to boot.

10:28.006 --> 10:30.004
And my name... is Moscow.

10:30.006 --> 10:32.005
[both] The Russian one!

10:32.007 --> 10:34.010
And together we are...

10:34.012 --> 10:37.009
-The Pioneers of the--
-Of the Uncharted. Got it.

10:37.020 --> 10:39.011
Zip Callahan. Wow.

10:39.013 --> 10:42.010
You made the back
of my kid's cereal box.

10:42.012 --> 10:44.006
I always wondered
what happened to you.

10:44.008 --> 10:47.007
[Moscow] Well,
that is a long story.

10:47.009 --> 10:51.005
So, where is
benevolent genius
Niles Caulder?

10:52.016 --> 10:55.013
He's, uh... He's a little
tied up at the moment.

11:31.001 --> 11:33.004
Hey.

11:33.006 --> 11:34.021
What are they doing?

11:34.023 --> 11:36.007
There was a vote.

11:36.009 --> 11:38.006
A funeral procession
seems appropriate.

11:38.008 --> 11:39.014
But we don't know
they're dead.

11:39.016 --> 11:40.014
You saw what that thing
did to them.

11:40.016 --> 11:43.001
Secretary, I'm gonna need you
to be, like,

11:43.003 --> 11:46.013
10% more self-aware.

11:46.015 --> 11:49.004
-This is a construct.
-[shushes]

11:49.006 --> 11:51.014
Are you a construct, Jane?

11:51.016 --> 11:53.014
You should be completely
ashamed of yourself.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.018
What does death
even mean here?

11:56.013 --> 11:58.004
Personas disappear.

11:58.006 --> 11:59.005
They go dormant for a while.

11:59.007 --> 12:02.009
But there's no evidence
we can even be killed.

12:03.011 --> 12:04.008
Not unless you pull a Miranda

12:04.010 --> 12:06.016
and throw yourself
into the well.

12:09.001 --> 12:10.007
No.

12:12.008 --> 12:13.021
There was a vote.

12:21.005 --> 12:23.020
[Cliff] <i>Dorothy.</i>

12:23.022 --> 12:25.008
Come out.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.006
-Come out.
-[Niles] Dorothy.

12:26.008 --> 12:28.006
[Cliff] You little shit...

12:28.008 --> 12:30.011
-[Niles] Dorothy.
-Dorothy!

12:33.007 --> 12:35.012
[Niles] Dorothy.

12:42.010 --> 12:45.006
[Dorothy] <i>I didn't do it.</i>

12:45.008 --> 12:48.018
<i>It was the Candlemaker.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

12:48.020 --> 12:50.010
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

12:51.008 --> 12:52.016
[rumbling]

12:52.018 --> 12:53.021
What the fuck?

12:56.003 --> 12:58.012
[loud rumbling]

13:04.005 --> 13:05.017
What's going on?

13:15.001 --> 13:17.009
Man, when the kid runs away,
she really runs away.

13:17.011 --> 13:19.011
Damn it, Cliff, keep up.
There's no time to lose.

13:19.013 --> 13:20.017
Pretty sure she's gone.

13:20.019 --> 13:22.018
You and I are gonna
bring her back.

13:22.020 --> 13:24.018
Here. Take this.
We'll need it.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.004
Uh, Chief, I'm sorry
your daughter ran away

13:26.006 --> 13:28.014
to space!

13:28.016 --> 13:29.017
But we've got a patient
on the table in there

13:29.019 --> 13:33.021
who we might actually
be able to... Whoa!

13:33.023 --> 13:37.000
You had a fucking spaceship
in this garage

13:37.002 --> 13:38.009
the whole time?

13:38.011 --> 13:39.011
When I lost contact
with the first ship,

13:39.013 --> 13:41.011
I saw no reason
to use the second.

13:54.008 --> 13:56.015
[Cliff] The fuck...

13:56.017 --> 13:58.009
Make sure the airlock
shuts behind you, Cliff.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.019
Things may be rusty.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.023
-When did you build this?
-1955,

14:05.001 --> 14:08.004
pre-Sputnik.
Technically speaking,

14:08.006 --> 14:09.012
I invented space travel.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.015
Fuck! And 30 years later,

14:11.017 --> 14:14.000
you still couldn't build me
a working hand.

14:14.002 --> 14:17.021
I've always done
the best I could
with what I get, Cliff.

14:17.023 --> 14:21.004
And in the '50s, science still
hadn't mastered basic rocketry,

14:21.006 --> 14:23.010
so I mixed my science with...

14:24.003 --> 14:26.010
a little bit
of borrowed magic.

14:26.021 --> 14:29.012
[machine whirring]

14:33.009 --> 14:34.013
[scoffs] You know what?

14:34.015 --> 14:36.022
I think you can solo
this one, Chief.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.015
I'm not in a rush
to get stranded in space

14:38.017 --> 14:40.014
on your homebrew
devil-ship.

14:40.016 --> 14:44.022
Give me the apple, Cliff.
We need fuel.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.010
Cliff, I need you.
Dorothy needs you.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.014
In case I haven't been clear,

14:49.016 --> 14:51.002
fuck Dorothy!

14:51.004 --> 14:52.015
I'm Team Jane,

14:52.017 --> 14:54.014
and I'd rather sit uselessly
by her side

14:54.016 --> 14:57.023
than chase your brat
across the cosmos.

14:58.001 --> 14:58.020
Listen to me, Cliff!

14:58.022 --> 15:01.018
If you ever want
my help with your body

15:01.020 --> 15:03.013
in the short time
that I have left,

15:03.015 --> 15:06.010
you will shut
your damned mouth

15:06.012 --> 15:08.016
and retrieve my child.

15:13.008 --> 15:15.003
[groans] Fuck it.

15:17.002 --> 15:18.023
[beeping]

15:21.013 --> 15:22.019
[rocket whooshing]

15:34.007 --> 15:35.014
[Cliff] I'm going to space.

15:35.016 --> 15:38.001
Of course. I'm fucking
going to space.

15:39.015 --> 15:40.022
What the hell
was she thinking?

15:44.020 --> 15:47.023
Does she have any idea
what I've done for her?

15:49.012 --> 15:50.019
She thinks
she can hide from me.

15:50.021 --> 15:54.013
I'll lock on
to her coordinates.

15:54.015 --> 15:57.007
She takes my ship
to get away.

15:57.009 --> 15:58.000
I built the damn thing!

16:01.020 --> 16:04.010
She's too dangerous
to go traipsing around,

16:04.012 --> 16:08.017
pretending that her actions
don't have any consequences!

16:15.020 --> 16:16.023
[Cliff speaks quietly]
No wonder she fucking ran.

16:19.018 --> 16:20.020
All systems go, Chief.

16:20.022 --> 16:24.004
Looks like the old dog's
got some new tricks.

16:24.006 --> 16:25.000
-What a whiz!
-[laughs]

16:25.002 --> 16:27.006
Seems our reunion
will have to wait.

16:27.008 --> 16:30.007
Yeah. About the whole
benevolent genius thing...

16:30.009 --> 16:31.016
I should probably warn you.

16:31.018 --> 16:34.020
-Oh, bust my chops, will ya?
-[both laughing]

16:34.022 --> 16:37.016
I got you,
you smooth little pip.

16:37.018 --> 16:39.011
[Specs] Gravity.
What a treat!

16:39.013 --> 16:41.013
[both laugh]

16:42.017 --> 16:45.019
We've been in space
for 65 years.

16:45.021 --> 16:48.017
It's gotten... weird.

16:48.019 --> 16:50.006
My real name
is Valentina Vostok.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.004
Vostok?

16:52.014 --> 16:54.020
The cosmonaut?

16:54.022 --> 16:57.010
Your disappearance was the talk
of the Mercury Program.

16:57.012 --> 16:59.016
And you must be
Captain Trainor.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.006
Your reputation in the
Air Force precedes you.

17:01.008 --> 17:03.002
Preceded.

17:03.021 --> 17:05.016
That was a long time ago.

17:12.019 --> 17:14.019
You have a Negative Spirit?

17:14.021 --> 17:17.023
Seems we have
much to discuss.

17:23.015 --> 17:26.002
[indistinct whispering]

17:32.023 --> 17:35.003
-Isabel. Isabel Feathers.
-Gertrude.

17:38.012 --> 17:39.022
Oh, no, thank you.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.008
I... I've seen this play
so many times,

17:42.010 --> 17:44.005
-I'm already off-book.
-Oh.

17:44.007 --> 17:47.009
Wow. But isn't the script
still being written?

17:47.011 --> 17:49.018
The script for <i>Our Town?</i><i>No.</i>

17:49.020 --> 17:51.011
I think Thornton Wilder

17:51.013 --> 17:52.015
finished it
quite some time ago.

17:52.017 --> 17:55.013
I see where you're confused.
We're not doing <i>Our Town.</i>

17:55.015 --> 17:57.004
We're doing <i>Our Town!</i>

17:57.006 --> 18:00.002
[woman] Welcome to the
first readthrough of <i>Our Town.</i>

18:00.004 --> 18:02.018
The script is woven from
first-person testimonies,

18:02.020 --> 18:05.020
newspaper reports, journals,

18:05.022 --> 18:08.017
and what we know in hindsight
about the day our town

18:08.019 --> 18:10.018
was sucked into the ground.

18:10.020 --> 18:13.013
Tonally, kind of, like,
<i>The Laramie Project.</i>

18:13.015 --> 18:15.011
But more important.

18:15.013 --> 18:16.007
We'll read through Act One,

18:16.009 --> 18:18.003
"The Day the
Monsters Attacked."

18:18.005 --> 18:19.018
We'll cruise
right through Act Two,

18:19.020 --> 18:22.008
"Life as a Series
of Portraits,"

18:22.010 --> 18:25.003
we'll break for lunch, and then
we'll tackle Act Three,

18:25.005 --> 18:28.004
"What We Talk about When We
Talk About the Donkey."

18:31.001 --> 18:33.003
-Let's begin.
-[applause]

18:38.001 --> 18:39.015
What part are you playing?

18:39.017 --> 18:42.006
The Blob Lady.
[giggles excitedly]

18:43.000 --> 18:45.007
[Moscow]
Sixty-five years ago,

18:45.009 --> 18:47.012
Niles Caulder assembled
a small team

18:47.014 --> 18:49.014
for a top-secret project.

18:49.016 --> 18:51.008
We were chasing
a cosmic entity,

18:51.010 --> 18:54.013
a teleporting rift that would
appear in the night sky.

18:54.015 --> 18:55.020
The mission was to find

18:55.022 --> 18:57.015
a pattern
in the cosmic radiation,

18:57.017 --> 18:59.000
which Niles believed
was a source

18:59.002 --> 19:00.022
of time-dilating power.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
A key to immortality.

19:02.002 --> 19:05.015
That puts your mission at 1955,

19:05.017 --> 19:07.014
six years before my accident.

19:07.016 --> 19:09.004
-Accident?
-Yeah.

19:09.006 --> 19:09.016
Niles used your research

19:09.018 --> 19:11.001
to send my X-15

19:11.003 --> 19:14.022
straight into that
cosmic radiation. Hence...

19:17.005 --> 19:19.020
-this.
-Then our mission
was a success.

19:19.022 --> 19:21.007
-How fortunate.
-Fortunate?

19:21.009 --> 19:23.021
-We sense you are angry.
-You sense correctly.

19:23.023 --> 19:26.009
That rift ruined my life.

19:27.017 --> 19:28.003
[Moscow] For us,
it was a gift.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.003
But we do recall
being upset for a time.

19:33.013 --> 19:35.001
[Larry sighs]

19:35.017 --> 19:37.018
The rift kept moving.

19:37.020 --> 19:39.005
The Pioneers chased it
deeper into space.

19:39.007 --> 19:41.017
We lost contact with Earth,
but Niles had insisted

19:41.019 --> 19:44.013
the mission was vital, so...

19:44.015 --> 19:45.011
when we next caught up to it,

19:45.013 --> 19:48.013
I went on a spacewalk
to take a sample.

19:48.015 --> 19:52.017
When I touched the energy...
Well, you know the rest.

19:53.023 --> 19:57.008
Not exactly,
because I was irradiated.

19:57.010 --> 19:58.012
If I remove these bandages--

19:58.014 --> 20:01.001
People die. Yes.

20:01.003 --> 20:03.011
That happened
to this body, too,

20:03.013 --> 20:05.013
before we learnt to contain

20:05.015 --> 20:07.000
the radiation within our skin.

20:07.002 --> 20:10.002
We had to live
in our ship's airlock.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.020
-It was a difficult five years.
-Five years?

20:13.022 --> 20:15.020
Yes. I am embarrassed to say

20:15.022 --> 20:18.015
it took five years to reach
harmony with my...

20:18.017 --> 20:21.018
-spirit, as you call it.
-Five years.

20:22.018 --> 20:26.006
You learned to master
that thing in five years.

20:26.008 --> 20:27.021
How long did it take you?

20:33.015 --> 20:34.017
Ah...

20:35.000 --> 20:35.018
Well...

20:35.020 --> 20:38.006
For us, the change happened

20:38.008 --> 20:41.020
when there stopped being
an "I" and a "She."

20:41.022 --> 20:43.015
The pass to infinite harmony

20:43.017 --> 20:47.007
was to accept,
there is only now, "We."

20:47.009 --> 20:48.018
Infinite harmony.

20:51.010 --> 20:52.018
In five years.

20:54.001 --> 20:55.018
[Vic] How weird
do you want me to get?

20:55.020 --> 20:58.006
Mmm, just tell the truth.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.003
Okay.

21:01.005 --> 21:02.018
I was trying to save
an old friend,

21:02.020 --> 21:05.019
a guy named Niles Caulder.

21:05.021 --> 21:07.023
Then an omniscient bad guy

21:08.001 --> 21:10.016
put a viral thought
in my head.

21:10.018 --> 21:13.003
What if I can't trust
my own dad?

21:13.005 --> 21:16.019
Next thing, I was...
beating my old man to death.

21:16.021 --> 21:18.015
-Holy shit.
-Yo, I'm skipping over

21:18.017 --> 21:20.002
a pocket universe in a donkey,

21:20.004 --> 21:21.019
a world-ending cult,
a world-saving cult,

21:21.021 --> 21:23.003
a secret government branch

21:23.005 --> 21:25.016
that housed a pack
of flesh-eating butts.

21:25.018 --> 21:28.003
-Wait. Are you being
for real right now?
-For real.

21:28.005 --> 21:31.001
-For real, for real.
-For real, for real?

21:32.012 --> 21:34.015
[both laugh]

21:34.017 --> 21:36.012
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

21:36.014 --> 21:37.007
I'm laughing at your PTSD.

21:37.009 --> 21:39.012
Look, this is why
I can't do group.

21:39.014 --> 21:41.004
Hold still. I'm trying
to get a good image.

21:41.006 --> 21:42.017
-My bad, my bad.
-Come on.

21:42.019 --> 21:45.011
[scanners pulsing]

21:46.012 --> 21:47.009
Yo.

21:48.018 --> 21:49.010
What is this?

21:49.012 --> 21:51.021
What?

21:51.023 --> 21:54.006
Did you used to have tech
fused to your spine?

21:54.008 --> 21:56.009
Oh, yeah.

21:56.011 --> 21:57.008
That old thing.

21:57.010 --> 22:00.023
Yeah, there was a skeletal
support system

22:01.001 --> 22:02.001
before they ripped it out.

22:02.003 --> 22:04.002
Experimental weapons
ain't light.

22:04.004 --> 22:06.001
One of these broken
attachment points is--

22:06.003 --> 22:08.003
Leaking poison
into my organs.

22:08.005 --> 22:11.018
Uh-oh. You kind of sound
like my doctors.

22:11.020 --> 22:12.007
It's kind of sexy.

22:14.003 --> 22:16.004
-[chuckles]
-You knew this?

22:16.006 --> 22:17.018
Roni, this stuff
could kill you.

22:17.020 --> 22:21.012
No, Vic. This stuff
is killing me.

22:21.014 --> 22:25.012
As in, doctors stumped
and chemicals classified.

22:26.016 --> 22:30.009
I told you I'd die before I
pay off my bills, didn't I?

22:30.011 --> 22:30.019
Jokes.

22:30.021 --> 22:32.005
Nice defense.

22:32.007 --> 22:34.007
I don't have
many other options.

22:38.002 --> 22:40.009
Okay, I'm hacking
the military.

22:40.011 --> 22:41.010
What?

22:41.012 --> 22:42.008
If I can figure out
what's inside of you,

22:42.010 --> 22:44.009
I can figure out
how to neutralize it.

22:44.011 --> 22:46.005
Uh-uh. Don't you dare
make me your project.

22:46.007 --> 22:49.001
I am not your
redemption story, okay?

22:49.003 --> 22:51.017
And if you're so worried
about being a bad guy,

22:51.019 --> 22:54.010
how about not hacking
the government on my behalf?

22:56.011 --> 22:58.014
It's a small price to pay
for what I've done.

22:58.016 --> 23:02.005
[imitates beeping noise] Oops.
Hacked the government.

23:02.007 --> 23:05.004
-[clicks, whirs]
-Found your blueprints.

23:05.019 --> 23:07.006
You fucker.

23:07.008 --> 23:08.014
Okay, let's see.

23:08.016 --> 23:09.023
[chuckles]

23:10.001 --> 23:12.002
Oh, big parts list.

23:12.004 --> 23:13.022
Lot of sub-contractors.

23:14.000 --> 23:14.020
Here we go.

23:14.022 --> 23:16.006

23:16.008 --> 23:18.014
Wait, wait, wait.
Does that say "S.T.A.R. Labs"?

23:18.016 --> 23:19.009
And "Caulder Robotics."

Have you seen her before?

24:47.018 --> 24:48.005
No.

24:48.007 --> 24:50.001
Her station's deep.

24:50.021 --> 24:52.023
Do you think
this is why she exists?

24:53.018 --> 24:55.006
To mourn?

24:55.008 --> 24:57.004
You think the girl expected
to bury two of us?

24:57.006 --> 24:59.007
I'm just saying each of us
serves a purpose.

24:59.009 --> 25:02.014
What does it mean
if Baby Doll's dead?

25:02.016 --> 25:02.017
Less playtime,

25:03.023 --> 25:05.006
more adulthood.

Maybe that's fucking normal.

25:06.021 --> 25:09.004
But she's one of the only ones
who trusted men.

25:09.006 --> 25:11.003
Who wanted their affection.

25:11.005 --> 25:12.014
And look where it got her.

25:12.016 --> 25:13.018
So, that's it?

We're just going
to destroy that part of us?

what's going on out there?

26:02.004 --> 26:03.017
I'm responsible for this.

26:05.020 --> 26:07.003
I made us stay.

26:09.016 --> 26:10.017
But now, I don't know
how to fix it.

26:13.021 --> 26:15.014
[sniffles]

26:18.020 --> 26:20.006
Just tell me you're okay.

26:23.007 --> 26:24.012
Tell me I didn't hurt you.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.020
Please.

26:29.022 --> 26:31.009
What am I supposed to do?

26:32.006 --> 26:32.018
Knowing is your job.

26:34.016 --> 26:34.017
[crying softly]

26:37.019 --> 26:37.020
[sniffles]

26:42.005 --> 26:45.007
[Vic] So, you have no idea
about the off-market
blueprints I sent over?

26:45.009 --> 26:48.006
<i>S.T.A.R. Labs</i>
<i>is a big company, son.</i>

26:48.008 --> 26:49.018
<i>With lots of clients.</i>

26:49.020 --> 26:51.020
This seems pretty relevant
to your interests, Dad.

26:51.022 --> 26:53.011
<i>What's your angle on this?</i>

26:53.013 --> 26:54.007
-It shouldn't matter.
<i>-I'm not gonna dig deeper</i>

26:54.009 --> 26:57.018
on classified military tech

26:57.020 --> 26:59.007
without some context.

26:59.009 --> 27:00.023
It's for this girl, okay?

27:01.001 --> 27:01.020
It's her schematic, they ripped
this stuff out of--

27:01.022 --> 27:04.000
A girl?

27:04.002 --> 27:06.005
Vic, you buried the lede.

27:06.007 --> 27:08.013
-Dad?
<i>-I should have seen the signs.</i>

27:08.015 --> 27:10.010
<i>Hacking secret documents,</i>

27:10.012 --> 27:12.015
<i>poking around dark corners</i>
<i>of the military.</i>

27:12.017 --> 27:14.006
It's young love.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.020
-Little fatherly advice?
-Pass.

27:15.022 --> 27:18.006
<i>Slow down.</i>

27:18.008 --> 27:19.017
<i>Get to know this girl better.</i>

27:19.019 --> 27:21.021
People involved
with high-tech black ops--

27:21.023 --> 27:23.008
<i>Oh, really?</i>

27:23.010 --> 27:24.020
<i>Says the man</i>
<i>whose own company</i>

27:24.022 --> 27:25.023
<i>sold tech to the same</i>
<i>black ops.</i>

27:26.001 --> 27:28.002
Seriously.

27:28.004 --> 27:28.020
How could you
let this happen?

27:28.022 --> 27:29.017
I'm gonna level
with you, son.

27:31.022 --> 27:33.009
That kind of money...

27:33.011 --> 27:34.019
<i>is what makes you possible.</i>

27:37.018 --> 27:40.017
-[Zip laughs]
-[Specs] Smooth little pip!

27:40.019 --> 27:42.004
Oh, come here, you.

27:42.006 --> 27:44.015
-[grunts]
-You old dog.

27:44.017 --> 27:44.018
[laughs]

27:57.023 --> 27:59.013
[Moscow] She is your family?

28:02.003 --> 28:03.006
No.

28:06.020 --> 28:09.013
But she may be the only
family I have left.

28:16.015 --> 28:18.007
When you think
of your family,

28:18.009 --> 28:20.021
your spirit grows restless.

28:20.023 --> 28:22.012
-We see it.
-Oh, yeah?

28:22.014 --> 28:24.007
Maybe that's because
my own son

28:24.009 --> 28:25.012
just tried to imprison
both of us.

28:25.014 --> 28:28.017
And my grandson
got shot in the gut.

28:28.019 --> 28:31.018
Such a loving,
healthy family reunion.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.021
Prompted, by the way,
by the spirit.

28:35.012 --> 28:36.011
I wouldn't even know
my other son committed suicide

28:36.013 --> 28:38.012
if this thing
hadn't shown me.

28:38.014 --> 28:39.019
What if it's trying
to tell you...

28:39.021 --> 28:42.014
that you can release your
dead son from your conscience.

28:42.016 --> 28:45.006
The past can chain us
to old wounds,

28:45.008 --> 28:47.011
traumas from our youth.

28:48.008 --> 28:50.022
There is relief
in letting the past go.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.014
You don't know
what you're talking about.

28:52.016 --> 28:55.001
And this Zen master bullshit
isn't helpful.

28:55.003 --> 28:56.002
It's inhuman.

28:56.004 --> 28:58.009
My son killed himself,
because he was obsessed

28:58.011 --> 29:01.007
with his absentee father.

29:01.009 --> 29:02.008
And if that's not worth
being tormented by,

29:02.010 --> 29:04.012
I don't know what is.

29:09.006 --> 29:10.021
[rumbling, beeping]

29:29.004 --> 29:30.016
This is my fault.

29:32.011 --> 29:34.016
I was so desperate
to give Dorothy a family

29:34.018 --> 29:34.019
before I'm...

29:36.021 --> 29:39.008
gone.

29:39.008 --> 29:41.010
I pushed Jane
before she was ready.

29:42.023 --> 29:46.011
Jane's like a daughter to me,
Cliff, you must understand.

29:48.008 --> 29:51.016
I just wanted Dorothy

29:51.018 --> 29:53.015
to be normal.

29:56.002 --> 29:59.020
Which made me a terrible father
and a bastard

29:59.022 --> 30:03.017
and quite possibly responsible
for the world's end.

30:05.002 --> 30:05.021
[Cliff] Is she really
that dangerous?

30:08.002 --> 30:09.013
I isolated her.

30:11.016 --> 30:14.005
And in her terror, she spawned
imaginary creatures.

30:14.007 --> 30:15.020
But as she got older...

30:17.002 --> 30:19.013
the creatures became
more dangerous.

30:20.006 --> 30:21.011
Even here...

30:22.000 --> 30:22.019
left to her own devices,

30:22.021 --> 30:26.014
she could unleash
a being so powerful

30:26.016 --> 30:29.012
it would cleave
the Earth in two.

30:31.023 --> 30:32.020
All it would take...

30:35.005 --> 30:36.023
is for Dorothy to wish it so.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.014
Please, Cliff.

30:44.020 --> 30:45.021
Tell her...

30:45.023 --> 30:50.000
all will be forgiven.
Tell her I love her.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.005
Tell her anything.

30:53.007 --> 30:54.022
Just get her back.

31:55.017 --> 31:56.000
[Cliff] What you makin'?

32:03.011 --> 32:04.017
A grave.

32:07.001 --> 32:08.021
Do you need help?

32:08.021 --> 32:09.019
No.

32:13.011 --> 32:14.023
Can I sit here for a while?

32:31.016 --> 32:33.012
And that's when I realized...

32:34.001 --> 32:36.004
I could make them pay.

32:36.006 --> 32:37.011
The ones
who laughed at me,

32:37.013 --> 32:38.003
called me freak,

32:38.005 --> 32:40.003
goo girl,

32:40.005 --> 32:41.015
Mrs. Melty.

32:41.017 --> 32:43.022
[laughs] Oh, they'd pay.

32:46.004 --> 32:48.008
I'd suffocate them all...

32:48.010 --> 32:49.007
under the weight...

32:49.009 --> 32:52.001
of my rage!

32:53.009 --> 32:56.011
[all applauding]

32:57.020 --> 32:59.022
Very nice work, everyone.

33:01.005 --> 33:01.016
Um...

33:01.018 --> 33:04.014
Very nice work, uh,

33:04.016 --> 33:06.006
but we didn't get
all the way through it.

33:06.008 --> 33:07.004
We didn't?

33:07.006 --> 33:10.008
But more pages
and revisions coming soon.

33:10.010 --> 33:11.006
This is beautiful work.

33:11.008 --> 33:13.019
Important work.

33:13.021 --> 33:15.001
Let's pick it up
again tomorrow.

33:17.021 --> 33:20.009
Hey, Gertrude,
nice job today.

33:20.011 --> 33:22.016
[sighs] Thanks.

33:22.018 --> 33:23.021
I so love the humanity

33:23.023 --> 33:26.020
that you brought
to the bee keeper.

33:26.022 --> 33:28.010
I mean, who knew the attack
on Cloverton

33:28.012 --> 33:30.019
killed so many bees?

33:30.021 --> 33:33.016
The way you
eulogized them, oh.

33:33.018 --> 33:35.017
I could feel your pain.

33:36.006 --> 33:37.016
Have you acted before?

33:38.010 --> 33:40.021
Once or twice.

33:40.023 --> 33:42.022
-Mmm.
-If I could offer one thought.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.009
It's not a note,
simply an observation.

33:45.011 --> 33:47.009
Sure.

33:47.011 --> 33:48.022
-The Blob Lady.
-Mmm-hmm.

33:49.007 --> 33:50.014
I wonder...

33:50.016 --> 33:52.001
if she's more human.

33:52.003 --> 33:55.003
Not quite so drive-in
picture monster.

33:55.005 --> 33:56.017
After all,

33:56.019 --> 34:00.005
villains think
that they're the heroes
of their own stories.

34:00.007 --> 34:01.014
Oh, no.

34:02.007 --> 34:04.014
I thought
I was playing that.

34:05.008 --> 34:07.007
Shoot!

34:08.001 --> 34:08.022
Like,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.014
I even did a deep-dive
character bio

34:11.016 --> 34:13.020
for background
because all the first-hand

34:13.022 --> 34:16.010
accounts of the event
were so sketchy.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.019
A biography.

34:18.011 --> 34:18.023
Do tell.

34:19.001 --> 34:21.006
Well, the way I see it,

34:21.008 --> 34:24.000
the Blob Lady didn't
actually seem to enjoy

34:24.002 --> 34:25.008
being so big.

34:25.010 --> 34:26.018
Which means she probably

34:26.020 --> 34:28.002
started off small.

34:28.004 --> 34:30.012
But her dress
was fancy, like...

34:30.014 --> 34:31.018
she wanted to be seen.

34:31.020 --> 34:33.021
There's a neediness there,

34:33.023 --> 34:36.017
like a little girl trapped
in a woman's body

34:36.019 --> 34:37.020
still desperately vying

34:37.022 --> 34:40.005
for the approval of her father.

34:40.007 --> 34:41.016
Mother.

34:41.018 --> 34:43.017
Right. Of course,
it's the mother.

34:43.019 --> 34:46.009
That lines up so much better.
Thank you.

34:46.011 --> 34:47.019
So, the Blob Lady

34:47.021 --> 34:50.014
has been craving attention

34:50.016 --> 34:52.002
for so long,

34:52.004 --> 34:55.007
she is terrified that
when people see what she is,

34:55.009 --> 34:57.017
what she really is,

34:57.019 --> 34:59.017
they are going
to run screaming

34:59.019 --> 35:02.004
because she is hideous

35:02.006 --> 35:03.013
inside and out.

35:03.015 --> 35:05.018
Just, like,
completely unlovable,

35:05.020 --> 35:07.023
unlookable, unfuckable.

35:08.001 --> 35:08.023
And then,
everything her mother

35:09.001 --> 35:12.023
always said about her
would be proven true.

35:13.001 --> 35:14.021
And the sick joke of it all,

35:14.023 --> 35:17.019
is that her resentment
of her mother...

35:17.021 --> 35:18.022
is the one thing keeping her

35:19.000 --> 35:21.013
from what she was
always meant to do.

35:21.015 --> 35:23.015
What is she meant to do?

35:23.017 --> 35:26.007
Suck the entire world

35:26.009 --> 35:29.006
into the folds of her
big, disgusting body.

35:32.002 --> 35:32.020
[sighs]

35:32.022 --> 35:33.022
Anyway, thank you.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.017
I will work on that.
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:38.014 --> 35:40.007
Well...

35:42.009 --> 35:44.004
I've found my nemesis.

35:49.005 --> 35:51.003
[Zip] Come here,
you smooth little pip.

35:51.005 --> 35:54.012
[Specs] All right, hotshot,
you're a real whiz.

35:54.014 --> 35:56.011
[Larry] Hey. Hey, hey.

35:56.013 --> 35:57.001
What's your deal?

35:57.003 --> 35:59.014
I'm Zip, hotshot pilot.

35:59.016 --> 36:01.000
Nothing scares him,

36:01.002 --> 36:02.004
except marriage.

36:02.006 --> 36:05.007
No, I know. I mean,
how are you so young?

36:05.009 --> 36:07.007
You're not telling me
you have spirits in you, too?

36:09.014 --> 36:10.014
The name's Specs.

36:10.016 --> 36:12.000
I'm the brains of the op.

36:12.002 --> 36:12.019
And a heartbreaker to boot.

36:12.021 --> 36:15.020
How are you still alive?

36:15.022 --> 36:16.003
[Moscow] They're not.

36:18.004 --> 36:20.008
Zip and Specs
died a long time ago.

36:21.000 --> 36:21.021
[laughs]

36:21.023 --> 36:23.002
Come here,
you smooth little pip.

36:23.004 --> 36:25.005
[Specs] Gravity, what a treat.

36:26.011 --> 36:28.000
What is this?

36:28.002 --> 36:30.005
The bodies of Zip and Specs
were invaded by a benign spore

36:30.007 --> 36:32.003
from a distant planet
some years ago.

36:32.005 --> 36:34.020
The men you see
before you are husks,

36:34.022 --> 36:36.021
autopiloted by some...

36:36.023 --> 36:37.017
foreign plant matter.

36:37.019 --> 36:39.015
Is it contagious?

36:39.017 --> 36:41.001
We don't believe so.

36:41.014 --> 36:42.018
In fact, we,

36:43.003 --> 36:44.005
mostly she,

36:44.007 --> 36:46.017
sense that bringing their
bodies into Earth's atmosphere

36:46.019 --> 36:48.022
would kill the spores.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.001
You came back to bury them?

36:51.003 --> 36:54.000
We need to put
the past behind us,

36:54.002 --> 36:56.002
if we are ever going
to travel farther.

36:56.018 --> 36:58.009
[Zip and Specs grunting]

36:58.011 --> 36:58.022
Nothing scares me.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.014
Bust my chops, will you?

37:01.016 --> 37:04.008
-[Zip] Come here, you dog.
Bust my chops...
-[Specs groans]

37:04.010 --> 37:06.006
I'm sorry I've been
so irritable.

37:07.012 --> 37:08.007
Sounds like you've been
through hell.

37:11.010 --> 37:12.009
We don't see it that way.

37:13.004 --> 37:16.002
Even suffering
has its own meaning.

37:17.008 --> 37:19.008
And there is always
beauty in meaning.

37:21.016 --> 37:24.009
We have seen much.

37:24.011 --> 37:28.006
And Earth is still the most
beautiful place in the galaxy.

37:33.008 --> 37:36.008
Because it's a spinning orb
of constant suffering?

37:37.012 --> 37:38.009
Yes.

37:40.011 --> 37:41.012
Exactly.

37:52.019 --> 37:55.003
Is Jane okay?

37:55.016 --> 37:56.022
I have no idea.

37:59.001 --> 38:02.003
Now I understand why
my dad is so scared of me.

38:05.023 --> 38:09.023
I keep messing things up.

38:15.009 --> 38:15.010
Daddy.

38:19.018 --> 38:20.021
Jane.

38:23.007 --> 38:25.023
The more I'm out here
in the world...

38:27.021 --> 38:31.004
the more I'm sure
I'm a bad person.

38:37.003 --> 38:39.011
I'm going to stay up here,

38:39.013 --> 38:41.008
away from anyone I can hurt.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.010
-Forever.
-Mmm.

38:44.012 --> 38:45.016
I don't think
that's how oxygen works.
