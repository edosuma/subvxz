WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.470
(indistinct chatter)

00:08.208 --> 00:09.710
ANNA: Excuse me.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.377
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:11.411 --> 00:13.313
Are you a lawyer?

00:13.346 --> 00:14.247
I am.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.449
My name is Anna Vjorka,

00:16.482 --> 00:18.084
and I need a lawyer.

00:19.152 --> 00:20.353
I see.

00:20.386 --> 00:21.287
Do you have any money?

00:21.788 --> 00:25.125
Um, some, $12.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.292
I see.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.995
You know $12
barely covers the time

00:29.029 --> 00:31.865
it would take me to say,
"I can't help you."

00:31.898 --> 00:35.168
And since I've already said it,
give me the 12 bucks.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.336
I'm from Romania.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.838
That's a nice country.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.072
Beautiful castles.

00:39.105 --> 00:41.174
ANNA: I don't want
to go back.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.676
Can you please help me?

00:42.709 --> 00:43.777
Anna.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.145
What are you doing?

00:46.179 --> 00:47.781
I'm not going back, dad.

00:47.814 --> 00:48.682
What do you mean you're not--

00:48.715 --> 00:49.783
I'm not going.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.485
Can you please help me?

00:52.519 --> 00:53.219
Anna.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.321
What's going on here?

00:55.355 --> 00:56.690
ANNA: If I go back
to Romania,

00:56.723 --> 00:58.725
they'll force me
to get married.

00:58.759 --> 00:59.626
Anna, let's go.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.161
One second, sir.

01:01.194 --> 01:03.804
What do you mean they're
gonna force you to get married?

01:03.837 --> 01:06.239
They will, like they did
with my sister.

01:06.272 --> 01:08.374
This is a family matter.
Let go of me.

01:08.407 --> 01:11.177
Mr. Vjorka, your daughter
is represented by counsel.

01:12.445 --> 01:13.847
Sir...

01:13.880 --> 01:16.049
I'm sure you don't mean
to make trouble.

01:16.082 --> 01:17.918
Oh, but I do.
You're a foreigner.

01:17.951 --> 01:19.485
Take your hand off the girl

01:19.520 --> 01:21.354
or I'll get you declared
a person of interest,

01:21.387 --> 01:22.823
which means you'll be
locked up forever

01:22.856 --> 01:25.058
without so much as a trial.
Don't think I kid you.

01:25.091 --> 01:27.060
This is the
United States of America.

01:27.093 --> 01:28.929
I'm about to call
for the police.

01:29.963 --> 01:31.665
Excuse me.
I hate to interrupt,

01:31.698 --> 01:33.066
but this one's urgent,
Your Honor.

01:33.099 --> 01:35.736
Alan Shore representing,
uh--is it Anya?

01:35.769 --> 01:37.037
Anna Vjorka.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.271
Anna Vjorka.

01:38.304 --> 01:40.140
Petition
for political asylum.

01:40.173 --> 01:41.875
Res Ipsa Doozy.

01:44.244 --> 01:49.182
(music playing)

02:23.389 --> 02:24.257
Where's the girl now?

02:24.290 --> 02:25.626
The custody of the INS.

02:25.659 --> 02:27.293
We have a hearing
scheduled for 2:00.

02:27.327 --> 02:28.361
Why were you even there?

02:28.394 --> 02:30.363
I was filing an appeal
on a household matter

02:30.396 --> 02:32.633
and stumbled across
the girl and her father.

02:32.666 --> 02:34.234
Jamie, could you do some

02:34.267 --> 02:35.969
political asylum
research for me?

02:36.002 --> 02:37.403
I need it quickly.

02:37.437 --> 02:40.340
And also dig up whatever
you can on the Roma faith.

02:40.373 --> 02:41.274
Roma?

02:41.307 --> 02:42.909
R-O-M-A, yes.

02:44.177 --> 02:46.713
Jimmy, looking well.

02:46.747 --> 02:47.814
Meaning what?

02:49.983 --> 02:51.384
He's always meaning something

02:51.417 --> 02:53.286
with his little comments.

02:53.319 --> 02:54.888
Enough with the comments.

02:56.623 --> 02:57.457
Oh, you have a walk-in.

02:57.490 --> 02:58.391
Lawrence Gilbert.

02:58.424 --> 02:59.526
He's in your office.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.067
He seems in need.

03:03.904 --> 03:06.272
Nine months ago,
my wife was murdered.

03:09.375 --> 03:10.376
I'm sorry.

03:10.410 --> 03:12.779
She had been stalked,

03:12.813 --> 03:16.550
and the police
were unable to deter him,

03:17.951 --> 03:20.887
and eventually...

03:20.921 --> 03:22.556
she was stabbed in our home.

03:23.389 --> 03:26.392
I've just come from
the district attorney's office.

03:26.426 --> 03:28.428
The trial
is set to begin tomorrow.

03:28.461 --> 03:30.831
And I've just been informed

03:30.864 --> 03:32.999
by the district attorney that

03:33.033 --> 03:35.301
she intends to offer 15 years.

03:36.002 --> 03:38.639
I'm here (sighs)
wondering whether,

03:38.672 --> 03:39.973
as the husband of the victim,

03:40.006 --> 03:42.042
I have any rights
to enjoin this.

03:42.075 --> 03:45.712
Actually, you don't.

03:45.746 --> 03:47.213
Clearly,
if you were to pursue

03:47.247 --> 03:48.815
the defendant civilly,
you'd have rights,

03:48.849 --> 03:51.384
but in a criminal
proceeding--

03:51.417 --> 03:54.988
What about--could we get it
removed to a federal court?

03:55.021 --> 03:57.791
I know the federal government
sometimes claims

03:57.824 --> 03:58.992
jurisdiction for murder cases

03:59.025 --> 04:00.667
so they can impose
the death penalty,

04:00.701 --> 04:03.737
which (sighs)
this man deserves.

04:04.337 --> 04:06.507
Again, you would have
no standing

04:06.540 --> 04:08.942
to try to influence
a criminal prosecution.

04:08.975 --> 04:11.678
Do you think you could speak
to this district attorney?

04:13.914 --> 04:14.981
This is what he did to her.

04:16.482 --> 04:18.819
You can't do that to somebody

04:18.851 --> 04:20.754
and only get 15 years.

04:24.357 --> 04:25.926
Could you talk to this DA?

04:33.233 --> 04:34.167
Sure.

04:35.068 --> 04:37.003
(sighs)

04:37.036 --> 04:38.071
Thank you.

04:40.807 --> 04:43.744
(music playing)

05:04.605 --> 05:08.742
So, let's talk
about your sister.

05:08.775 --> 05:09.943
How old is she?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.145
She was 13
when she got married.

05:12.178 --> 05:13.413
Now she's 16.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.785
Uh, after
she was married, um...

05:18.819 --> 05:22.455
did she and her
new husband, uh...

05:22.488 --> 05:24.558
Yes.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.193
My father waved the sheets
with blood on them.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.764
That's tradition.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.199
To show that the marriage
was consummated.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.204
Consummated is a big word
for a 12-year-old to use.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.073
There are some words
I looked up.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.542
That's one of them.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.111
Why is your English so good?
You have no accent.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.180
We lived with relatives

05:47.213 --> 05:49.883
in the United States
for six years.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.786
My mother was a visiting
professor at Amherst.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.889
And then we moved back
two years ago.

05:55.922 --> 05:59.459
And we've been on vacation here
for the last two weeks.

06:00.934 --> 06:04.204
Where does your mother
stand in all this?

06:04.605 --> 06:06.106
With my father.

06:10.844 --> 06:12.679
You think I wanna give
him murder two?

06:12.713 --> 06:13.780
Look at my office.

06:13.814 --> 06:15.582
I'm obsessed
with getting this guy.

06:15.616 --> 06:19.452
I'm just facing
the possibility that I won't.

06:19.485 --> 06:20.721
Walk with me.

06:20.754 --> 06:22.122
Why wouldn't you get him?

06:22.155 --> 06:23.957
It's all circumstantial.

06:23.990 --> 06:27.794
No witnesses or forensics
putting him in that house.

06:27.828 --> 06:29.596
Worst-case scenario
is he walks.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.231
I don't think Mr. Gilbert
wants that to happen.

06:31.264 --> 06:32.533
Well, this guy
got any priors?

06:32.566 --> 06:34.635
A ton,
but if he doesn't testify,

06:34.668 --> 06:36.002
they don't come in, Eugene.

06:36.036 --> 06:38.104
Look, I am not saying

06:38.138 --> 06:38.972
that we're not gonna get him.

06:39.005 --> 06:40.206
I'm just saying it's a risk.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.742
I've explained
this to your client.

06:41.775 --> 06:43.977
He's just too emotional
to hear it.

06:44.010 --> 06:45.311
And by the way,

06:45.345 --> 06:47.514
the defendant
turned down the 15.

06:48.114 --> 06:49.550
What does that tell you?

06:54.755 --> 06:56.723
I notified the attorney
general's office.

06:56.757 --> 06:58.124
They don't oppose.

06:58.158 --> 06:59.425
Well, I do.

06:59.459 --> 07:01.735
Your Honor,
all I'm asking is that the girl

07:01.768 --> 07:03.904
be questioned in chambers
instead of a big,

07:03.937 --> 07:05.471
intimidating theater.
Come on.

07:05.872 --> 07:07.340
The courtroom
is where we conduct

07:07.373 --> 07:10.243
all our legal business,
openly, notoriously,

07:10.276 --> 07:11.912
in keeping
with the constitution

07:11.945 --> 07:14.347
and the intent
of our founding fathers.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.717
I do all my business openly

07:16.750 --> 07:18.552
and notoriously, Counsel.

07:18.585 --> 07:19.986
All of it.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.888
How about sex, Your Honor?

07:23.489 --> 07:25.158
You've brought
before me a motion

07:25.191 --> 07:27.628
for political asylum, Counsel.

07:27.661 --> 07:30.531
That is a very serious piece
of legal business.

07:30.564 --> 07:32.566
It will be tried
and adjudicated

07:32.599 --> 07:34.568
in the courtroom.

07:37.838 --> 07:39.172
Uh, it's not that
she won't get him.

07:39.205 --> 07:40.674
She very well may.

07:40.707 --> 07:42.142
On murder one?

07:42.175 --> 07:43.777
Uh, well,
that could be tough.

07:43.810 --> 07:46.112
More likely murder two or--

07:46.146 --> 07:47.814
Thirty-one times
he stabbed her.

07:47.848 --> 07:50.050
What could be more
heinous than that?

07:50.083 --> 07:52.252
YOUNG: With that many wounds...

07:53.554 --> 07:56.422
clearly he kept stabbing her
after she was dead.

07:56.456 --> 07:59.926
Now, that suggests
a rage or mental state

07:59.960 --> 08:01.602
that goes more
to murder two--

08:01.635 --> 08:02.435
So he could get parole?

08:03.970 --> 08:05.906
This man deserves
to get a bullet

08:05.939 --> 08:07.340
right between his eyes.

08:07.373 --> 08:09.109
Look, she's trying
for murder one.

08:09.142 --> 08:11.377
She is a good DA.

08:11.845 --> 08:13.747
You mentioned going
after him civilly.

08:13.780 --> 08:14.948
I'd like to do that.

08:14.981 --> 08:17.017
Mr. Gilbert--
GILBERT: I'd like to do that.

08:17.050 --> 08:19.485
He comes from money.
I know he has a house.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.154
Mr. Gilbert...

08:21.187 --> 08:24.525
people sometimes
get consumed by hatred.

08:26.126 --> 08:28.494
Don't let this man
make you more of a victim

08:28.529 --> 08:30.363
than you already are.

08:31.364 --> 08:33.866
I think it would empower me
to sue him civilly.

08:35.034 --> 08:36.269
Would you represent me?

08:38.371 --> 08:40.774
Let me monitor the criminal
trial for a day or two,

08:40.807 --> 08:41.875
and I'll let you know.

08:43.744 --> 08:46.813
Assuming you are going
to sue this man civilly,

08:46.847 --> 08:48.815
let me give you some advice.

08:48.849 --> 08:51.017
It's illegal to use
a criminal case

08:51.051 --> 08:53.554
for the purpose
of advancing a civil one.

08:53.587 --> 08:55.889
Now, I know
you're not doing that, but...

08:58.124 --> 08:59.626
Ms. Alexander
tells me you've been

08:59.660 --> 09:01.802
to the US Attorney's Office,

09:01.835 --> 09:02.969
pressuring them.

09:06.006 --> 09:09.175
In federal courts,
they have the death penalty.

09:09.209 --> 09:12.412
That's what he deserves, death.

09:14.114 --> 09:17.518
Well, if you hope to have
a civil claim at all,

09:17.551 --> 09:20.120
you need to lay off
the prosecutors.

09:28.762 --> 09:31.264
A Chinese girl was granted
asylum three years ago.

09:31.297 --> 09:32.833
Forced marriage?
That's the good news,

09:32.866 --> 09:34.067
but it's not precedent.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.737
And Ashcroft has since
recalled for further review

09:36.770 --> 09:40.206
all cases involving gender
as a basis for asylum,

09:40.240 --> 09:42.242
including forced marriages.

09:42.275 --> 09:43.343
Great.

09:45.546 --> 09:47.147
Jimmy.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.149
Continuing to look well.

09:49.182 --> 09:50.617
As are you, Alan.

09:50.651 --> 09:53.319
I'm afraid
it's against the law

09:53.353 --> 09:56.590
for you specifically
to stand there.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.626
Fire code. No egress.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.402
Another fat comment, Al?

10:03.504 --> 10:05.071
All right, Jimmy,
I must warn you

10:05.105 --> 10:07.908
in addition
to my knowing jiu-jitsu,

10:07.941 --> 10:10.644
I'm also a direct descendant
of Jonny Quest.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.414
See how the lips move

10:14.447 --> 10:16.216
while very few words come out?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.051
Keep it up, Shore.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.052
Keep it up.

10:19.085 --> 10:19.886
Hey.

10:22.556 --> 10:25.058
The next-door neighbor
had noticed a car

10:25.091 --> 10:27.561
parked several nights
on their street

10:27.594 --> 10:29.596
with a man sitting inside,

10:29.630 --> 10:31.898
looking at a laptop computer.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.399
ALEXANDER: Did she get
a look at the driver?

10:33.433 --> 10:34.267
DETECTIVE: No.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.002
But she took down
the plate number,

10:36.036 --> 10:37.838
then called us
after the murder.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.874
The car was registered
to Jake Spooner, the defendant.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.510
We secured a search warrant
for Mr. Spooner's home

10:43.544 --> 10:44.878
in Cambridge and executed it.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.647
And what did you find,
Detective?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.114
DETECTIVE:
On the defendant's computer,

10:48.148 --> 10:49.816
we found hours
of video footage

10:49.850 --> 10:51.417
of the Gilberts' nursery.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.253
Did you determine
the source?

10:53.286 --> 10:54.154
DETECTIVE: Yes.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.356
The Gilberts
had a camera in the room.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.258
They used it
as a baby monitor.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.960
It was over
their daughter's crib.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.002
Okay. But how did
these images end up

11:02.035 --> 11:03.570
on the defendant's computer?

11:03.604 --> 11:05.205
He's the one who
installed the cameras,

11:05.238 --> 11:06.573
as well
as the other electronics

11:06.607 --> 11:07.974
in the victim's house.

11:08.008 --> 11:11.344
And he also set up a system
to intercept their videos.

11:11.812 --> 11:13.246
ALEXANDER: And, Detective,
can you tell us

11:13.279 --> 11:16.650
what these videos on
the defendant's computer showed?

11:16.683 --> 11:20.020
On one file, it was mostly
the baby sleeping.

11:20.053 --> 11:21.955
Sometimes Tracy Gilbert
came in the room

11:21.988 --> 11:23.356
and played with her baby,

11:23.389 --> 11:25.659
and twice she breastfed
her child.

11:25.692 --> 11:27.093
Mr. Gilbert was on it too,

11:27.127 --> 11:28.995
feeding her a bottle.

11:29.029 --> 11:30.263
But there was another file

11:30.296 --> 11:31.932
where he had edited
together scenes

11:31.965 --> 11:34.000
and digitally
manipulated them,

11:34.034 --> 11:36.637
giving them some special
effects that he added.

11:36.670 --> 11:38.138
Hmm.

11:39.906 --> 11:42.843
(music playing)

12:15.782 --> 12:18.251
So, basically,
he made a movie.

12:18.284 --> 12:20.654
A graphic, disturbing movie.

12:20.687 --> 12:22.355
Detective, Tracy Gilbert

12:22.388 --> 12:24.224
had been stabbed 30 times?

12:24.257 --> 12:25.726
Over 30.

12:25.759 --> 12:27.460
Would it be fair to say
whoever killed her

12:27.493 --> 12:29.830
would likely be soaked
in her blood?

12:29.863 --> 12:30.831
Yes.

12:30.864 --> 12:32.866
And yet you found none
of Mrs. Gilbert's blood

12:32.899 --> 12:35.035
on any of my client's
clothes, did you?

12:35.068 --> 12:35.836
DETECTIVE: No.

12:35.869 --> 12:37.504
WILLOW: What about his house?

12:37.538 --> 12:39.640
DETECTIVE: Not blood,
but his prints

12:39.673 --> 12:41.608
were all over
the victim's house.

12:41.642 --> 12:43.677
But he'd been in the house
fixing some equipment

12:43.710 --> 12:45.679
a week before, right?

12:45.712 --> 12:46.780
That's correct.

12:46.813 --> 12:47.781
Thank you.

12:47.814 --> 12:49.449
No further questions,
Detective.

12:51.652 --> 12:52.753
Ms. Alexander?

12:52.786 --> 12:54.287
Nothing, Your Honor.

12:54.821 --> 12:56.189
KIRKLAND:
We'll recess and resume

12:56.222 --> 12:58.058
with our next witness
after lunch.

12:58.091 --> 12:58.992
(gavel bangs)

13:22.422 --> 13:25.091
I don't even like him.
Like who, Anna?

13:25.125 --> 13:27.293
The boy that
I'm supposed to marry.

13:27.327 --> 13:28.829
I don't think he's nice.

13:28.862 --> 13:30.797
I don't think he's cute.

13:30.831 --> 13:32.933
I don't think he's anything.

13:33.433 --> 13:36.336
Now, Anna, uh, in Romania,

13:36.369 --> 13:39.172
the legal age for marriage
is 18, am I right?

13:39.205 --> 13:40.807
Yes. But we are Roma.

13:41.608 --> 13:43.777
That's our religious faith.

13:43.810 --> 13:46.747
Tradition is that they
arrange child weddings

13:46.780 --> 13:47.981
all the time.

13:49.482 --> 13:51.718
My sister
got married at 13,

13:53.554 --> 13:55.321
and she had to have sex.

13:56.890 --> 13:58.859
I don't want to have sex.

13:59.893 --> 14:02.503
BENNETT: You say these arranged
marriages happen a lot?

14:02.536 --> 14:03.637
Yes.

14:03.670 --> 14:06.006
Some of your friends
get married in this way?

14:06.039 --> 14:07.407
Yes.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.575
BENNETT:
Are they okay with it?

14:08.609 --> 14:10.544
Maybe they are, but I'm not.

14:11.177 --> 14:12.713
Are you afraid of this boy?

14:12.746 --> 14:15.649
No. I just don't wanna
marry him,

14:15.682 --> 14:17.117
or anybody else.

14:17.150 --> 14:19.553
Now, let's talk
about your mom and dad.

14:19.953 --> 14:21.021
Do you love them?

14:21.421 --> 14:22.523
I do.

14:22.556 --> 14:24.324
But that doesn't mean
that I have to follow

14:24.357 --> 14:26.359
all their ancient rules,

14:26.392 --> 14:28.729
especially, the ones
that are barbaric.

14:28.762 --> 14:29.896
Barbaric.

14:29.930 --> 14:31.197
Did your lawyer tell you
to use that word?

14:31.231 --> 14:32.132
Objection.

14:32.165 --> 14:33.834
I told her to use
reprehensible,

14:33.867 --> 14:35.135
repugnant, and criminal.

14:35.168 --> 14:37.337
She came up with barbaric
all on her own.

14:38.505 --> 14:39.405
Continue.

14:39.439 --> 14:42.142
What do you think
of America, Anna?

14:42.175 --> 14:43.810
I love it.

14:43.844 --> 14:46.747
Tell me, excluding
this marriage business,

14:46.780 --> 14:49.215
if you could choose
which country

14:49.249 --> 14:51.184
you'd rather live in,
what would it be?

14:51.217 --> 14:53.219
America.

14:53.253 --> 14:54.721
I see.

14:55.822 --> 14:58.725
Is it possible
this might be more

14:58.759 --> 15:00.534
about your wanting
to stay here

15:00.567 --> 15:02.669
than it is your fearing
going back there?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.540
It's about me not wanting
to get married.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.975
It's about me not wanting
to have to be raped

15:09.009 --> 15:12.713
by some 15-year-old boy
I don't even like.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.354
A client?

15:21.387 --> 15:22.623
Former client.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.958
Uh, I represented him
10, 12 years ago.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.326
I mean, his name
didn't ring a bell,

15:26.359 --> 15:27.427
but when I saw his face--

15:28.829 --> 15:30.931
When you represented him,

15:30.964 --> 15:32.432
what was he charged with?

15:34.601 --> 15:35.636
Murder.

15:37.571 --> 15:39.272
You got him off?

15:39.305 --> 15:41.474
YOUNG: Look, uh, Mr. Gilbert,
I was doing my job.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.243
Uh, it's not like
I liked the guy.

15:45.579 --> 15:49.550
Listen, obviously,
I would have a conflict

15:49.583 --> 15:51.451
representing you
against him.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.019
But let me do this.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.755
I'll monitor the trial
a little bit more.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.057
I'll assess your case.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.792
That much I can do.

16:02.969 --> 16:04.605
If she's this opposed,

16:04.638 --> 16:06.406
I won't make her go
through with it.

16:06.439 --> 16:08.675
Well, according to Anna,
her sister was opposed.

16:08.709 --> 16:10.544
She was crying and screaming

16:10.577 --> 16:11.678
when they brought her
into the church.

16:11.712 --> 16:12.613
She had to go through
with it.

16:12.646 --> 16:15.448
The ceremony was halted
and continued

16:15.481 --> 16:16.650
only after she agreed.

16:16.683 --> 16:17.618
Under duress?

16:17.651 --> 16:21.121
Mr. Shore,
my daughter is afraid

16:21.154 --> 16:22.756
she'll miss her
friends here.

16:22.789 --> 16:24.691
That's what this is about.

16:24.725 --> 16:26.459
I'm sure there
are many kids coming out

16:26.492 --> 16:27.928
of Disneyland
seeking asylum too.

16:27.961 --> 16:30.330
You are forcing
your 12-year-old daughter

16:30.363 --> 16:31.464
to be married, sir.

16:31.497 --> 16:32.332
Please don't equate
that with--

16:32.365 --> 16:33.900
MR. VJORKA:
There are Mormon families

16:33.934 --> 16:35.368
who do that in this country.

16:35.401 --> 16:37.303
SHORE: The Mormon Church
does not sanction--

16:37.337 --> 16:39.506
MR. VJORKA:
But it happens. It goes on.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.275
And the police don't always
enforce the law against it,

16:42.308 --> 16:43.510
do they, Mr. Shore?

16:43.544 --> 16:44.911
How about we strike
a deal then?

16:44.945 --> 16:46.112
You leave
your daughter here.

16:46.146 --> 16:48.181
We'll raise her in Utah.
Objection.

16:48.214 --> 16:51.117
Our marital success rate
far surpasses

16:51.151 --> 16:52.786
the divorce numbers
in this country.

16:52.819 --> 16:54.621
SHORE: Just goes to show you
what a little servitude

16:54.655 --> 16:55.455
will get you, right,
Mr. Vjorka?

16:55.488 --> 16:57.023
STUCKY: Mr. Shore.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.002
What happens now?

17:02.035 --> 17:05.438
Well, tomorrow morning,
we hear from your mother.

17:06.339 --> 17:07.674
Tell me about her.

17:07.708 --> 17:10.877
She's very nice, smart,

17:11.645 --> 17:13.012
a professor.

17:13.046 --> 17:15.582
If you had trouble
with my dad,

17:15.616 --> 17:17.983
you'll be no match for her.

17:18.785 --> 17:21.154
You don't think
I'm any match for you, do you?

17:25.391 --> 17:26.593
How are we doing?

17:27.292 --> 17:30.664
Political asylum
is tough, Anna.

17:30.697 --> 17:34.300
Though the whole world
apparently hates us right now,

17:34.334 --> 17:37.738
we still seem to be
the destination of choice.

17:37.771 --> 17:41.107
Do you think you could
take me away from here?

17:42.709 --> 17:45.512
Just for an hour or two.

17:45.546 --> 17:47.380
It's so depressing here.

17:47.413 --> 17:50.483
I'll tell you what,
I'll try to persuade the judge

17:50.517 --> 17:52.519
to let me take you out
for breakfast.

17:57.123 --> 17:59.225
May I ask...

17:59.259 --> 18:00.767
do you have children?

18:00.801 --> 18:02.368
I'm sure I must.

18:05.271 --> 18:06.840
I know you're going to win.

18:08.141 --> 18:09.576
Hmm.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.245
When I was looking around
the courtroom yesterday,

18:12.278 --> 18:15.849
deciding what lawyer
to run up to,

18:15.882 --> 18:19.019
I saw your face and I knew...

18:20.286 --> 18:22.656
you would be the one
to save me.

18:26.292 --> 18:29.162
The victim
was stabbed 31 times

18:29.195 --> 18:32.666
over her face, neck,
torso, hands.

18:32.699 --> 18:34.067
The blows
were of such a force,

18:34.100 --> 18:36.603
her head was almost
separated from her body.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.939
What can you tell us
about the weapon?

18:38.972 --> 18:41.775
It was a knife
with a 6 1/4-inch blade,

18:41.808 --> 18:42.843
serrated edges.

18:42.876 --> 18:45.445
Do you know if the knife
was ever located?

18:45.478 --> 18:46.713
It was not.

18:46.747 --> 18:48.915
However,
we found this knife set

18:48.949 --> 18:50.483
in the defendant's kitchen.

18:50.517 --> 18:52.919
The set is always sold
with five knives

18:52.953 --> 18:54.588
of varying lengths.

18:54.621 --> 18:56.957
The defendant
had only four knives.

18:56.990 --> 19:01.267
The one with the serrated
6 1/4-inch blade was missing.

19:01.301 --> 19:03.970
Tests showed that the wounds
to Mrs. Gilbert's body

19:04.004 --> 19:06.206
were consistent
with the missing knife.

19:06.239 --> 19:09.375
And did the wounds tell you
anything about the killer?

19:09.409 --> 19:11.044
From the angles
of penetration,

19:11.077 --> 19:12.378
we determined
that the killer

19:12.412 --> 19:15.649
was over six feet
and left-handed.

19:15.682 --> 19:17.417
The knife
you're referring to,

19:17.450 --> 19:19.452
would it surprise you
to learn that 5,000

19:19.485 --> 19:20.954
identical knives were sold

19:20.987 --> 19:23.524
in the last three years
in the Boston area?

19:23.557 --> 19:25.025
No.

19:25.058 --> 19:26.192
And to confirm...

19:26.226 --> 19:28.228
you never found
the murder weapon.

19:28.962 --> 19:30.296
No, we did not.

19:34.835 --> 19:37.638
Yes, it's circumstantial,
but from where I sit,

19:37.671 --> 19:39.272
he's going away.

19:39.305 --> 19:40.574
GILBERT: Murder one?

19:40.607 --> 19:42.643
Well, that I don't know.

19:43.510 --> 19:45.311
I have here an article.

19:45.345 --> 19:47.914
It says where
the federal government

19:47.948 --> 19:49.783
can also bring
civil rights charges,

19:49.816 --> 19:52.052
and it doesn't amount
to double jeopardy.

19:52.085 --> 19:54.521
Does the death penalty
ever apply

19:54.555 --> 19:56.056
to these civil rights cases?

19:58.959 --> 20:00.233
Mr. Gilbert...

20:04.838 --> 20:07.440
I would never presume to know
what you're going through,

20:07.473 --> 20:08.975
but, um...

20:11.578 --> 20:13.013
are you getting counseling?

20:15.882 --> 20:18.384
See, uh, I took
the liberty of looking

20:18.418 --> 20:19.586
at some of those videos,

20:19.620 --> 20:22.222
and there was one
in particular.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.958
You were sitting in a chair,
feeding your daughter.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.328
And what I saw was a father,

20:28.361 --> 20:30.496
a man full of love,

20:30.531 --> 20:32.098
somebody tender.

20:33.199 --> 20:36.503
What I see sitting across
from me now

20:36.537 --> 20:38.872
is a man dominated by hate.

20:39.873 --> 20:42.308
Now, while your rage
is certainly understandable,

20:44.077 --> 20:47.147
I would think that
what your wife would want

20:47.180 --> 20:50.350
for your daughter is for you

20:50.383 --> 20:53.854
to try to be the man
that I saw in that video.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.223
I, um...

21:00.801 --> 21:02.869
I don't really know how to do

21:02.903 --> 21:04.538
anything else right now,

21:05.772 --> 21:07.373
besides hate him.

21:12.245 --> 21:14.047
Uh, and to be honest,

21:16.482 --> 21:18.251
I hate you a little,
as well

21:21.755 --> 21:24.057
for getting him off
10 years ago,

21:24.090 --> 21:25.592
for putting--

21:28.562 --> 21:30.030
I'm sorry.

21:34.434 --> 21:37.704
Well, my testimony
is first up.

21:37.738 --> 21:39.405
I suppose
I should get some rest.

21:39.439 --> 21:44.277
(music playing)

21:57.958 --> 22:00.667
Should I give you the big
defense-attorney speech?

22:04.170 --> 22:06.239
I gave that speech to my wife
at the time.

22:06.272 --> 22:07.841
I gave her the line, you know.

22:09.109 --> 22:10.243
Uh, "We represent the guilty,

22:10.276 --> 22:13.514
thus ultimately protecting
the innocent."

22:17.518 --> 22:18.685
This...

22:19.986 --> 22:22.088
was one of the innocents
I was protecting.

22:35.301 --> 22:37.538
GILBERT: After he had worked
for us, he kept coming around,

22:37.571 --> 22:40.173
presumably to check
the equipment he installed.

22:40.206 --> 22:42.208
ALEXANDER: Did this
strike you as strange?

22:42.242 --> 22:44.410
Perhaps a little.
But we weren't alarmed,

22:44.444 --> 22:47.914
until Tracy started
to notice him at the market,

22:47.948 --> 22:50.383
the gym, her art class.

22:50.416 --> 22:51.985
He was everywhere
she went.

22:52.018 --> 22:53.787
We soon realized
he was stalking her.

22:54.420 --> 22:55.522
Did you go to the police?

22:55.956 --> 22:57.357
We did.

22:57.390 --> 22:59.159
They said since these were
all public places,

22:59.192 --> 23:00.834
there was nothing
they could really do.

23:01.535 --> 23:03.469
And, Mr. Gilbert,
at some point,

23:03.504 --> 23:05.739
you confronted the defendant,
did you not?

23:05.772 --> 23:07.874
GILBERT: Yes. Two days
before the murder,

23:07.908 --> 23:11.111
I asked him to refrain
from following my wife.

23:11.144 --> 23:13.980
I told him he was scaring her
and my family.

23:14.014 --> 23:15.849
I stated I was afraid
for her safety.

23:16.349 --> 23:17.818
And how did he respond?

23:17.851 --> 23:20.186
He said if he wanted
to harm her,

23:20.220 --> 23:22.689
he wouldn't just
follow her around.

23:24.558 --> 23:27.193
WILLOW: My client had been
in your house many times.

23:27.227 --> 23:29.262
Yes, doing
electrical work.

23:29.763 --> 23:31.898
Even as recent as a week
before the murder,

23:31.932 --> 23:32.999
he was in your house.

23:33.567 --> 23:34.234
Yes.

23:35.068 --> 23:36.837
So you didn't regard him
as a threat.

23:37.704 --> 23:38.972
We were getting nervous,

23:39.005 --> 23:42.375
but we attributed it
to our own paranoia.

23:42.408 --> 23:44.310
Then about a week before,

23:44.344 --> 23:45.912
he entered the house
without knocking,

23:45.946 --> 23:48.148
and it jolted my wife.

23:48.181 --> 23:49.716
That's when
I went to the police.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.518
Two days after that,
I confronted him.

23:51.552 --> 23:53.720
I assume you loved your wife
very much.

23:53.754 --> 23:55.689
You assumed correctly.

23:56.389 --> 23:58.058
Love anyone else, as well?

23:59.325 --> 24:00.433
I beg your pardon?

24:01.467 --> 24:02.603
Were you having an affair

24:02.636 --> 24:04.337
at the time
of your wife's death?

24:09.743 --> 24:11.111
Did you kill your wife,
Mr. Gilbert?

24:11.144 --> 24:12.045
Objection!

24:12.078 --> 24:13.614
KIRKLAND: Ms. Willow,
you'd better have

24:13.647 --> 24:15.716
a good-faith basis
for that question.

24:15.749 --> 24:16.983
Sidebar, Your Honor.

24:23.957 --> 24:25.358
ALEXANDER: What's this about?

24:25.391 --> 24:28.729
Your Honor, last night
I received an anonymous message.

24:28.762 --> 24:31.431
I submit a copy
for your review.

24:31.464 --> 24:32.799
It may be completely bogus,

24:32.833 --> 24:35.569
but since it alleges that
Mr. Gilbert was having an affair

24:35.602 --> 24:37.971
and that he is the killer
of his wife, Tracy,

24:38.004 --> 24:40.140
bogus or not, it's enough
to give me good faith

24:40.173 --> 24:41.341
for asking the question.

24:43.744 --> 24:45.011
I'll allow it.
Your Honor, I really...

24:45.045 --> 24:47.480
But you're on a short leash.

24:48.882 --> 24:50.050
Now step back.

24:56.723 --> 24:59.225
WILLOW: Let's start
with the affair, Mr. Gilbert.

24:59.259 --> 25:00.667
Were you in love
with another woman

25:00.701 --> 25:02.536
at the time
of your wife's murder?

25:09.610 --> 25:11.144
I'd like to exercise
my Fifth Amendment right

25:11.177 --> 25:11.878
not to answer.

25:12.913 --> 25:15.849
(indistinct chatter)

25:22.388 --> 25:25.058
It had nothing to do
with this case.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.793
YOUNG: Mr. Gilbert,
it may be irrelevant,

25:26.827 --> 25:29.062
but we need...
She's married.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.931
She has a family.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.866
I can't--
I can't do this to them.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.936
(door opens and closes)

25:35.969 --> 25:37.137
What the hell is going on?

25:37.170 --> 25:39.205
Uh, am I free to say
what you have told me?

25:39.239 --> 25:42.609
No.
Let me tell you something,

25:42.643 --> 25:46.112
if you plead the Fifth,
you giftwrap reasonable doubt

25:46.146 --> 25:47.247
with a big, red bow.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.448
Do you understand me?

25:51.618 --> 25:53.787
The fact of the matter is,
Mr. Gilbert,

25:53.820 --> 25:54.888
you have no alibi

25:54.921 --> 25:55.989
for the night
of the murder.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.726
Nobody can verify
they saw you working late.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.702
The reason we dismissed you
as a suspect

26:01.735 --> 26:02.936
is we had no motive.

26:02.969 --> 26:03.737
Now we do.

26:03.770 --> 26:04.671
Hold on a second.

26:04.705 --> 26:05.872
I'm not trying
to threaten you.

26:05.906 --> 26:08.474
I'm just making you aware.

26:08.509 --> 26:10.143
This is what
the defense attorney

26:10.176 --> 26:11.712
will play like a trombone.

26:13.046 --> 26:14.648
Our only chance now

26:14.681 --> 26:16.650
is to explore this affair,

26:16.683 --> 26:18.552
rule you out as a suspect.

26:18.585 --> 26:20.353
I'm not talking

26:20.386 --> 26:21.588
about the affair.

26:25.692 --> 26:27.427
Well, then we're done,
Mr. Gilbert.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.966
I'll certainly
keep prosecuting,

26:32.999 --> 26:33.867
but we're done.

26:36.570 --> 26:39.239
(door opens and closes)

26:39.272 --> 26:42.208
(music playing)

26:49.115 --> 26:51.818
MRS. VJORKA:
I was married when I was 12.

26:51.852 --> 26:54.420
My mother was married
when she was 14.

26:54.454 --> 26:56.990
My grandmother was married
when she was 13.

26:57.023 --> 26:58.992
All arranged marriages?

26:59.025 --> 26:59.960
Yes.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.503
All successful, as well,
I might add.

27:02.536 --> 27:04.470
BENNETT: But, Mrs. Vjorka,

27:04.505 --> 27:06.339
you do appreciate
that the idea

27:06.372 --> 27:08.241
is a little offensive
to Americans.

27:08.274 --> 27:09.910
I do.

27:09.943 --> 27:12.345
But Americans
have trouble comprehending

27:12.378 --> 27:14.648
non-romantic unions.

27:14.681 --> 27:16.950
Well, marriage
without love...

27:16.983 --> 27:19.152
Marriage is about family,

27:19.185 --> 27:21.755
partnerships for parenting.

27:21.788 --> 27:23.456
In our faith,

27:23.489 --> 27:26.893
it's also about preserving
ethnic identity.

27:26.927 --> 27:29.930
And, by the way,
arranged marriages

27:29.963 --> 27:31.932
still go on
in the United States,

27:31.965 --> 27:34.901
however, quietly,
for this very reason.

27:34.935 --> 27:35.936
BENNETT: In the United States?

27:35.969 --> 27:37.571
Yes.

27:37.604 --> 27:39.706
And I don't mean simply
in the Mormon faith.

27:40.373 --> 27:41.975
It happens with
Orthodox Jews,

27:42.008 --> 27:44.945
the Greeks, Muslims, Hindus.

27:45.579 --> 27:47.080
There are thousands
of such marriages

27:47.113 --> 27:49.349
every year in this country.

27:49.382 --> 27:50.884
You see nothing wrong

27:50.917 --> 27:52.819
with forcing Anna
to be married

27:52.853 --> 27:53.854
or to be raped?

27:53.887 --> 27:55.589
If she doesn't consent

27:55.622 --> 27:58.058
to consummating the marriage,
Mr. Shore,

27:58.091 --> 27:59.492
then sex shouldn't happen.

27:59.926 --> 28:01.367
SHORE:
But, Mrs. Vjorka, come on.

28:01.401 --> 28:03.303
If her 15-year-old husband

28:03.336 --> 28:06.139
overpowers her in the name
of religious consummation,

28:06.172 --> 28:07.741
he's not going
to be prosecuted, is he?

28:08.274 --> 28:09.976
MRS. VJORKA:
First of all, how dare you

28:10.010 --> 28:12.145
presume Roma boys
to be rapists?

28:12.579 --> 28:13.647
Because consummating
the marriage

28:13.680 --> 28:14.981
is part of Roma tradition.

28:15.015 --> 28:17.751
Consummation is traditional
in America, as well.

28:17.784 --> 28:19.152
But if the bride says no,

28:19.185 --> 28:20.521
we don't assume rape.

28:20.554 --> 28:22.989
We assume capacity
to give consent.

28:23.023 --> 28:24.725
We can't do that
with a 12-year-old.

28:24.758 --> 28:26.660
You don't know
our culture.

28:26.693 --> 28:28.695
I know this is
an archaic practice

28:28.729 --> 28:32.232
that has no place
in this child's life today.

28:32.265 --> 28:34.000
I know persecution,
Mrs. Vjorka.

28:34.034 --> 28:35.902
I know crime...
MRS. VJORKA: In this country,

28:35.936 --> 28:37.403
you take newborn babies

28:37.437 --> 28:39.906
and snip off the ends
of their penises.

28:39.940 --> 28:42.876
I imagine some other cultures
would object to that.

28:42.909 --> 28:45.111
The United States
believes in

28:45.145 --> 28:46.947
executing human beings

28:46.980 --> 28:49.950
while every other westernized
country finds that barbaric.

28:49.983 --> 28:51.785
Yes.

28:51.818 --> 28:54.387
I'm sure we could exchange
cultural barbs ad nauseam.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.789
It wouldn't change the fact

28:55.822 --> 28:57.257
you're this girl's
mother, uh...

28:57.290 --> 28:59.425
And I love her deeply.

29:00.266 --> 29:02.869
And perhaps you would
entertain the radical idea

29:02.903 --> 29:05.639
that a mother might know
what's best for her daughter.

29:05.672 --> 29:07.173
And perhaps
you could allow

29:07.207 --> 29:09.175
for the not-so-radical
reality,

29:09.209 --> 29:10.844
this girl is a child.

29:10.877 --> 29:12.979
MRS. VJORKA:
Whose parents deserve the right

29:13.013 --> 29:15.481
to raise her
according to their culture,

29:15.516 --> 29:18.084
even should it have
the audacity

29:18.118 --> 29:21.087
to vary from
the United States of America.

29:23.023 --> 29:24.925
Told you
she would be tough.

29:24.958 --> 29:26.492
Yes, you did.

29:29.896 --> 29:32.198
Anna, should we win here,

29:32.232 --> 29:34.334
are you going to be happy
being raised

29:34.367 --> 29:35.836
by your relatives?

29:36.369 --> 29:38.038
Maybe I'll marry you.

29:40.073 --> 29:41.141
Got you.

29:41.174 --> 29:42.342
(chuckles)

29:46.179 --> 29:48.081
My relatives understand.

29:49.349 --> 29:50.450
They'll look after me.

29:51.117 --> 29:52.753
Won't you miss
your parents?

29:52.786 --> 29:55.321
Of course, I will.

29:55.355 --> 29:57.157
I'll probably cry forever.

29:59.159 --> 30:01.067
But it's not right
that I should be forced

30:01.101 --> 30:03.604
to marry somebody
I do not love

30:03.637 --> 30:05.371
or even like.

30:06.807 --> 30:08.875
That is not right.

30:22.122 --> 30:23.657
(knocks on door)

30:23.690 --> 30:24.457
Jury's out?

30:25.458 --> 30:26.727
Who knows for how long

30:26.760 --> 30:28.595
with your friend
taking the Fifth?

30:29.329 --> 30:31.497
Who are we kidding?

30:31.532 --> 30:32.866
Do you think it's possible

30:32.899 --> 30:33.967
he could have done it?

30:35.368 --> 30:36.402
I don't know.

30:40.373 --> 30:44.310
You know, we always go
to the spouse first,

30:44.344 --> 30:45.679
because he had no alibi.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.682
We interviewed every person
in this guy's life.

30:48.715 --> 30:50.350
All of them said
he was devoted

30:50.383 --> 30:52.418
to his wife and family.

30:52.452 --> 30:53.987
"Hopelessly
in love with her"

30:54.020 --> 30:56.389
were the words
most often used.

30:56.422 --> 30:57.457
I don't see him

30:57.490 --> 30:59.192
stabbing her 31 times.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.436
No,

31:03.469 --> 31:06.106
I don't think
he could have done it,

31:06.139 --> 31:07.340
to answer your question.

31:13.847 --> 31:15.148
BENNETT: I'm not here

31:15.181 --> 31:18.685
representing
Mr. and Mrs. Vjorka.

31:18.719 --> 31:21.187
I'm here representing
the United States,

31:21.221 --> 31:24.558
a country being condemned
worldwide, at the moment,

31:24.591 --> 31:26.092
for imposing its views

31:26.126 --> 31:28.461
beyond its own borders.

31:29.229 --> 31:30.897
Do I favor
arranged marriages?

31:30.931 --> 31:32.198
Absolutely not.

31:32.232 --> 31:33.567
When children
are involved,

31:33.600 --> 31:34.668
I find it abhorrent,

31:34.701 --> 31:36.369
as I'm sure you do,
Your Honor.

31:36.402 --> 31:38.872
But it is simply
not our right

31:38.905 --> 31:41.474
to dictate our notion
of morality

31:41.508 --> 31:42.676
to foreign countries.

31:43.610 --> 31:46.246
Anna Vjorka is a wonderful,
little girl

31:46.279 --> 31:48.949
but by her own testimony,

31:48.982 --> 31:50.684
she's not really afraid
of getting married.

31:50.717 --> 31:52.418
She just doesn't
want to do it.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.354
That simply
fails to rise

31:54.387 --> 31:56.757
to the legal threshold
of persecution

31:56.790 --> 31:59.826
that warrants asylum.

31:59.860 --> 32:02.068
This girl
has a loving family,

32:02.102 --> 32:04.605
eager to safeguard
her future

32:04.638 --> 32:07.440
according to their culture
and their tradition.

32:07.473 --> 32:10.343
As much as we might reject
that tradition,

32:10.376 --> 32:12.145
it is not our right

32:12.178 --> 32:14.280
to substitute our own.

32:16.917 --> 32:18.985
Your Honor,
these are not particularly

32:19.019 --> 32:21.254
proud times
for Americans.

32:21.287 --> 32:23.389
Around the world,
we're increasingly

32:23.423 --> 32:25.258
perceived
as imperialists.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.392
Where they get that,

32:26.426 --> 32:27.528
I haven't a clue.

32:27.561 --> 32:29.630
But I think
we can all agree,

32:29.663 --> 32:32.332
the last thing
we need to do right now

32:32.365 --> 32:34.034
is to continue to police

32:34.067 --> 32:35.769
more foreign cultures.

32:35.802 --> 32:37.704
The truth is I agree
with almost everything

32:37.738 --> 32:39.439
Mr. Bennett just said.

32:39.472 --> 32:41.074
But this is a child

32:42.308 --> 32:44.044
facing an enforced marriage

32:44.077 --> 32:45.846
she does not want,

32:45.879 --> 32:47.648
facing enforced sex

32:47.681 --> 32:48.949
she does not want.

32:48.982 --> 32:50.784
This isn't tantamount
to rape,

32:50.817 --> 32:52.052
it is rape.

32:53.219 --> 32:54.054
Rape.

32:56.422 --> 32:58.224
It may surprise you,

32:58.258 --> 33:00.433
but I happen to be

33:00.466 --> 33:02.368
a very proud American,

33:02.402 --> 33:05.706
and where I remain most proud
of our nation

33:05.739 --> 33:07.974
is in the belief
that its people

33:08.008 --> 33:12.012
remain strongly committed
to human rights.

33:12.045 --> 33:14.548
At our noblest,
the United States

33:14.581 --> 33:16.850
serves to protect the weak,

33:16.883 --> 33:19.452
the oppressed.

33:19.485 --> 33:22.923
A 12-year-old child

33:22.956 --> 33:25.859
is asking you today
to spare her

33:25.892 --> 33:29.329
from an unimaginable
atrocity.

33:29.362 --> 33:32.432
I fully understand we can't
be policemen for the world,

33:32.465 --> 33:34.200
but...

33:34.234 --> 33:38.104
how about for one innocent,

33:38.138 --> 33:39.840
vulnerable child?

33:57.290 --> 33:58.859
You sure you wanna be here?

33:59.560 --> 34:00.867
They know he killed her.

34:00.901 --> 34:02.869
They have to know it.

34:02.903 --> 34:05.438
KIRKLAND: Mr. Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

34:06.607 --> 34:07.574
We have, Your Honor.

34:08.208 --> 34:09.676
The defendant
will please rise.

34:16.482 --> 34:17.583
What say you?

34:19.753 --> 34:22.856
In the matter of Commonwealth
versus Jake Spooner,

34:22.889 --> 34:26.159
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

34:26.192 --> 34:27.893
we find the defendant,
Jake Spooner,

34:28.629 --> 34:29.929
not guilty.

34:29.963 --> 34:31.063
(indistinct chatter)

34:31.097 --> 34:31.764
KIRKLAND: Thank you.

34:32.197 --> 34:33.900
This completes your service.

34:33.934 --> 34:35.536
Mr. Spooner, you are free to go.

34:35.902 --> 34:36.870
We are adjourned.

34:36.902 --> 34:38.004
(gavel bangs)

34:38.038 --> 34:40.974
(indistinct chatter)

34:43.777 --> 34:45.712
You okay?

34:45.746 --> 34:46.713
Mr. Gilbert?

34:48.313 --> 34:50.283
I can still pursue him
civilly, right?

34:50.315 --> 34:52.553
Well, uh,
that affair business

34:52.585 --> 34:54.755
would come up
in a civil trial too.

34:56.022 --> 34:57.558
Mr. Gilbert,
uh, I don't mean to sound

34:57.591 --> 34:59.960
like a broken
record here, but...

34:59.993 --> 35:01.401
you really need
to let it go now.

35:01.434 --> 35:02.903
I mean,
you have a little girl.

35:02.936 --> 35:04.838
You have your entire life
ahead of you.

35:04.871 --> 35:06.106
Uh, otherwise...
WOMAN: There he is.

35:06.139 --> 35:09.075
(indistinct chatter)

35:10.777 --> 35:12.178
I keep saying
I got nothing to say

35:12.212 --> 35:14.548
other than, uh,
this was justice.

35:14.581 --> 35:15.716
I'm innocent.

35:15.749 --> 35:17.784
I didn't stab anybody.

35:17.818 --> 35:20.253
And I'm grateful
that the jury saw it my way.

35:20.754 --> 35:22.889
And now I'm just to try
to get back on with my life...

35:22.923 --> 35:24.958
(grunts)
MAN: Oh, shots fired!

35:24.991 --> 35:26.026
Get down!

35:26.059 --> 35:28.995
(indistinct chatter)

35:32.633 --> 35:33.767
MAN: Stay where you are.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.737
(indistinct chatter)

35:42.809 --> 35:45.311
Witnesses reported
a blue pickup

35:45.345 --> 35:47.147
fleeing the scene.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.448
There has been no description

35:48.481 --> 35:50.083
of any of the occupants.

35:50.984 --> 35:52.452
Did he order it?

35:52.485 --> 35:53.587
Gilbert?

35:53.620 --> 35:54.788
I don't know.

35:55.722 --> 35:57.190
Well, who else
would have done it?

35:57.824 --> 35:58.959
I don't know.

35:58.992 --> 35:59.993
Where is he?

36:00.466 --> 36:02.135
Police got him
for questioning.

36:02.468 --> 36:04.671
Is there a reason
you're not with him?

36:06.773 --> 36:08.174
I'm done with the man.

36:20.754 --> 36:22.155
People from all over the world

36:22.188 --> 36:24.124
appear before me every day

36:24.157 --> 36:25.659
begging,

36:25.692 --> 36:28.895
"Please let me stay
in this country."

36:29.395 --> 36:31.965
Some facing
unimaginable poverty,

36:31.998 --> 36:33.199
oppression,

36:33.233 --> 36:34.701
or cultural hatred.

36:35.869 --> 36:37.137
We typically,

36:37.170 --> 36:38.605
uniformly,

36:38.639 --> 36:40.173
say no.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.677
Here we have a young girl who,

36:43.710 --> 36:45.311
quite justifiably,

36:45.345 --> 36:46.713
doesn't want to have her hand

36:46.747 --> 36:47.881
forced in marriage

36:47.914 --> 36:49.983
at the age of 12.

36:51.117 --> 36:53.620
Mr. and Mrs. Vjorka,

36:53.654 --> 36:55.355
I find this Roma tradition

36:55.388 --> 36:57.090
to be repugnant,

36:57.423 --> 36:59.092
even sick.

36:59.125 --> 37:00.600
But I realize that could be

37:00.634 --> 37:04.370
my own cultural bias talking.

37:04.403 --> 37:07.140
And I am mindful that
the legal test

37:07.173 --> 37:09.375
for persecution
is not how I feel

37:09.408 --> 37:12.178
or even what Anna feels,

37:12.211 --> 37:14.413
but what the reasonable person

37:14.447 --> 37:15.949
in Anna's predicament,

37:15.982 --> 37:18.952
in Anna's country would feel.

37:20.353 --> 37:22.155
The testimony in evidence

37:22.188 --> 37:24.224
seemed to clearly establish

37:24.257 --> 37:27.928
that these forced marriages
typically happen

37:27.961 --> 37:30.363
in the Roma faith.

37:30.396 --> 37:32.098
That it's a cultural norm.

37:32.666 --> 37:33.867
And that the reasonable

37:33.900 --> 37:35.702
Roma 12-year-old girl

37:35.736 --> 37:38.772
does not feel
persecuted by them.

37:39.673 --> 37:43.309
Looking at this
through their lens,

37:43.343 --> 37:46.346
which I am required
by law to do,

37:46.379 --> 37:49.082
I cannot find
the level of persecution

37:49.115 --> 37:52.285
that would authorize me
to grant asylum.

37:55.989 --> 37:58.659
Mr. and Mrs. Vjorka,

37:58.692 --> 38:01.602
I would love nothing more than
to impose my American culture

38:01.635 --> 38:04.170
and my American values upon you,

38:04.204 --> 38:06.039
but I can't.

38:06.707 --> 38:08.809
All I can do is hope,

38:09.510 --> 38:12.546
even pray, that you abide

38:12.579 --> 38:14.214
by your daughter's wishes.

38:18.251 --> 38:20.887
The plaintiff's petition
is denied.

38:20.921 --> 38:23.356
The minor should be immediately
released to her parents.

38:23.824 --> 38:24.825
(gavel bangs)

38:32.232 --> 38:33.099
(sighs)

38:38.672 --> 38:39.706
Can we appeal?

38:41.207 --> 38:42.142
No.

38:44.410 --> 38:46.513
What do you mean?

38:46.547 --> 38:47.948
There's always appeals.

38:48.615 --> 38:49.816
Not on this.

38:55.388 --> 38:56.690
That's not right.

39:00.300 --> 39:01.735
Why...

39:03.203 --> 39:04.137
MR. VJORKA: Anna?

39:05.872 --> 39:07.808
You need to come
with us now.

39:10.010 --> 39:11.244
I can't.

39:13.013 --> 39:13.880
I won't.

39:14.848 --> 39:16.182
MRS. VJORKA: Anna.

39:16.617 --> 39:17.951
You need to come with us.

39:24.925 --> 39:26.392
I'm sorry.

39:38.739 --> 39:40.306
Thank you very much.

39:44.678 --> 39:46.146
Goodbye, Mr. Shore.

39:47.247 --> 39:48.448
Goodbye, Anna.

39:48.481 --> 39:51.417
(music playing)

40:18.384 --> 40:20.420
What do I do with this
wrongful-death research?

40:21.487 --> 40:22.689
Put it in the file.

40:22.723 --> 40:25.592
We may send off an opinion
letter if he ever asks.

40:25.626 --> 40:27.493
And make sure
we bill him.

40:31.331 --> 40:32.733
Well, well, well,

40:32.766 --> 40:34.067
what have we here?

40:34.100 --> 40:35.368
A grieving husband?

40:35.401 --> 40:36.570
Murderer?

40:36.603 --> 40:37.270
Devil?

40:38.238 --> 40:39.172
All of the above?

40:41.041 --> 40:43.443
The police just questioned me
for five hours

40:43.476 --> 40:44.578
and released me.

40:44.611 --> 40:46.913
Yes. Well, I'm sure
there was no evidence.

40:46.947 --> 40:49.115
I'm sure the job
was immaculate.

40:49.816 --> 40:51.284
You stood beside me,
Mr. Young.

40:51.317 --> 40:54.020
You of all people know
I didn't kill Mr. Spooner.

40:55.522 --> 40:57.758
I don't know
you didn't order the hit.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.266
But I'll tell you this,
standing beside you,

41:00.300 --> 41:02.536
I had the opportunity
to see your face

41:02.569 --> 41:04.070
when your wife's
killer went down.

41:04.571 --> 41:06.907
You didn't look surprised,
Mr. Gilbert.

41:06.940 --> 41:08.875
One could almost conclude

41:08.909 --> 41:10.777
you expected him
to get shot.

41:11.978 --> 41:13.346
Is that what you think?

41:14.615 --> 41:15.916
Here's what I know,

41:15.949 --> 41:18.118
you were desperate
for the death penalty,

41:18.151 --> 41:19.853
you said to me,
"He deserves a bullet

41:19.886 --> 41:21.287
right between the eyes."

41:21.321 --> 41:23.423
Those were your exact words,
Mr. Gilbert.

41:23.456 --> 41:24.725
Quite a coincidence,
don't you think?

41:24.758 --> 41:27.093
I mean, considering
where he got shot.

41:33.567 --> 41:36.302
You never had any affair.

41:36.336 --> 41:39.405
You sent that anonymous note
to the defense counsel.

41:39.439 --> 41:41.274
You set yourself up
with the question,

41:41.307 --> 41:42.743
then you pled the Fifth,

41:42.776 --> 41:44.745
knowing full well
your wife's killer

41:44.778 --> 41:45.979
would be set free.

41:47.313 --> 41:50.116
Then you had him executed,

41:51.585 --> 41:53.554
because that's what
he deserved.

41:54.655 --> 41:56.489
Mr. Young,

41:56.523 --> 41:58.592
I'm sure Mr. Spooner
had many enemies

41:58.625 --> 42:01.167
who wanted him dead.

42:01.201 --> 42:02.736
After all,

42:02.769 --> 42:06.039
we know he killed
before, right?

42:06.072 --> 42:08.374
He was only free
on a technicality

42:08.809 --> 42:10.644
because you were able
to suppress

42:10.677 --> 42:12.045
most of the evidence.

42:15.982 --> 42:17.884
That's why you chose me.

42:19.820 --> 42:22.222
You knew all the time
I gotten him off.

42:23.924 --> 42:25.726
I wish you well, Mr. Young.

42:25.759 --> 42:28.695
(music playing)

42:55.221 --> 42:58.158
(music playing)

43:19.419 --> 43:20.521
BOY: Score, score.
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:20.554 --> 43:21.688
BOY: Oh. (groans)

43:22.789 --> 43:25.659
(music playing)
