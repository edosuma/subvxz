WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:04.338
(indistinct chattering)

00:07.108 --> 00:08.676
(hushed):
Stop it!

00:08.709 --> 00:10.044
Hope made this
for me at day care.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.545
It's not for eating.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.547
If I was wearing food,
I'd share it with you.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.283
Come on. Just a...

00:15.316 --> 00:17.285
Shh! Trailers are
the best part.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.387
I enjoy Jack Black
for 30 seconds at a time.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.788
Shh!

00:20.821 --> 00:22.390
I'll be quiet when
the cartoon popcorn

00:22.423 --> 00:25.826
tells me to be quiet.

00:25.859 --> 00:29.497
NARRATOR:
In every neighborhood,
there's a house like this.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.133
And in every house like that,

00:32.166 --> 00:33.701
there's a family like this.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.236
Pull my finger, Grandma.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.072
(farting)

00:38.106 --> 00:39.107
(laughs)

00:39.140 --> 00:40.808
(all laugh)

00:40.841 --> 00:43.344
But this Christmas,
this family is getting a gift

00:43.377 --> 00:44.712
they didn't expect.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.648
I got a serial killer pregnant,
and now she's dead

00:47.681 --> 00:50.584
and I have to raise
the baby...!

00:50.618 --> 00:52.486
(audience laughs)

00:54.288 --> 00:55.756
- Ugh!
- (gasps)

00:59.493 --> 01:00.694
Whuh-oh!

01:00.728 --> 01:02.396
(laughs)

01:02.430 --> 01:05.333
We ain't raising no baby!
I clean toilets all day.

01:05.366 --> 01:08.136
I ain't cleaning no
baby diapers all night long!

01:08.169 --> 01:09.303
I already cleaned
Grand Ma Ma's.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.538
(farting)

01:12.606 --> 01:15.276
I like her.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.179
How will this family
of idiots raise a baby

01:18.212 --> 01:20.848
when they can barely
keep themselves alive?

01:20.881 --> 01:23.284
I don't know why people
wait for their toast

01:23.317 --> 01:24.685
to come out to butter it.

01:24.718 --> 01:25.586
(zapping)

01:27.321 --> 01:29.390
Me... even stupider now!

01:29.423 --> 01:31.859
Me electrocute brain!

01:31.892 --> 01:35.396
ANNOUNCER:
This Christmas,
dumb gets a new name:

01:35.429 --> 01:37.331
It can't be us.
It can't be us. It can't be us.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.433
The Chances of Natesville.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.371
You'll be glad you're not them.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.406
Wackadoo!

01:45.439 --> 01:48.742
* Whoo

01:48.776 --> 01:52.846
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:54.515 --> 01:55.549
(sighs)

01:55.583 --> 01:57.518
I got a little crazy last night

01:57.551 --> 02:00.154
at the Bar Association
Christmas party.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.890
You gotta stop these people
from putting this movie out!

02:02.923 --> 02:06.194
According to my research,
Lucy's family sold the rights

02:06.227 --> 02:08.196
to their daughter's story,

02:08.229 --> 02:10.398
which they weren't that
interested in,

02:10.431 --> 02:12.900
except for the parts
that involved your family.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.703
Well, we
didn't sell our story!

02:15.736 --> 02:18.506
Well, apparently,
Jimmy did.
What?

02:18.539 --> 02:19.707
What in the hell?
Jimmy!

02:19.740 --> 02:21.675
I don't remember signing any...

02:23.377 --> 02:24.878
Oh, wait.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.715
Oh, I can't believe
I won a beach ball.

02:27.748 --> 02:28.849
I've never won anything.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.484
Yeah, it's all yours.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.685
You just need
to sign these documents

02:31.719 --> 02:34.522
in case of any possible injury
caused by the beach ball.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.629
Dad, you're not
gonna believe this!

02:43.797 --> 02:45.366
VIRGINIA:
A beach ball, Jimmy?

02:45.399 --> 02:47.735
You can get one of those
for free at a concert

02:47.768 --> 02:50.238
if you can snatch it out of
the air and run fast enough!

02:50.271 --> 02:51.872
I told you not to answer
the door after

02:51.905 --> 02:53.641
we got you back from
the Jehovah's Witnesses!

02:53.674 --> 02:56.610
Kelly, can you bring me
some aspirin?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.212
Wally, you gotta
shut this movie down!

02:58.246 --> 02:59.513
It opens
tomorrow night!

02:59.547 --> 03:00.981
If the whole world
sees this,

03:01.014 --> 03:03.251
we're gonna to be famous
in the bad way,

03:03.284 --> 03:04.818
like that no-name
actor from Lost

03:04.852 --> 03:07.688
who married
that 16-year-old girl. Mm!

03:11.024 --> 03:11.925
Oh!

03:17.030 --> 03:19.867
I slept with my assistant
last night.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.437
That's gonna make things
awkward around here.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.905
Forget about
what people think of us.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.708
What about Hope? I mean,
the whole world now knows

03:27.741 --> 03:29.543
she's the daughter
of a serial killer.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.313
And the guy playing me makes me
look like I have a paunch.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.647
Well, that would be upsetting

03:33.681 --> 03:35.716
because your abs are dynamite.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.818
But they have your signature.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.453
There's nothing I can do.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.992
Now, if there was something
wrong with your beach ball...

03:45.025 --> 03:46.860
No.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.029
It was awesome.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.532
Well, the Natesville Times
has weighed in.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.568
"Chances are you'll enjoy
laughing at these im-bec-iles."

03:54.602 --> 03:55.736
Which I thought was okay

03:55.769 --> 03:57.305
till I looked up
the word "im-bec-iles."

03:57.338 --> 03:58.005
Not good.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.320
Well, Hope's asleep
and waiting for Santa.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.288
Does anybody want
to go get a tree?

04:14.322 --> 04:15.823
I feel like
stringing lights up

04:15.856 --> 04:17.625
on something a bit
safer than a bathtub.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.428
WOMAN: Say cheese!
MAN: Gotta get a picture...

04:20.461 --> 04:23.497
Apparently, that operator I
called this morning wasn't able

04:23.531 --> 04:25.633
to get our names out of the
phone books, because now we got

04:25.666 --> 04:28.536
a bunch lookie-loos
gawking at our house!

04:28.569 --> 04:30.804
MAN: Come on, you guys,
come look!
Hey, you wanna
take a picture of something?!

04:30.838 --> 04:32.005
Take a picture of this!

04:33.407 --> 04:34.675
I wouldn't go out
there, Jimmy.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.976
Someone might try
to convince you

04:36.009 --> 04:38.579
to trade our house
for a yo-yo.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.481
Oh, fine, I get it.
I'm stupid!

04:40.514 --> 04:42.450
Yes! And now,
thanks to you,

04:42.483 --> 04:44.385
everyone's gonna believe
the nonsense in that movie

04:44.418 --> 04:45.886
and think we're trash.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.389
Move over, Burt,
I want in on this.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.457
It's not just me.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.824
We're all stupid!

04:50.858 --> 04:52.926
You guys are always
doing stupid stuff like...

04:52.960 --> 04:53.927
Like what?

04:53.961 --> 04:54.728
Name something.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.033
Ah, the Christmas lights
in the tub?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.536
Ah, you already said that.
Admit it, you're the dumb one

05:02.570 --> 05:03.937
for selling the movie people
your rights.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.773
It's not my fault.
I'm your kid.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.476
If I'm dumb, it's because I've
got you guyses "D" and "A".

05:08.509 --> 05:09.643
I'm getting a tree!

05:11.144 --> 05:13.681
I just had
the most invigorating bath.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.648
(sighs)

05:15.983 --> 05:18.051
Oh, man...

05:20.120 --> 05:22.122
Hey, what are you
guys doing?!

05:22.155 --> 05:24.525
You promised me you
weren't gonna see the movie!

05:24.558 --> 05:28.496
To be fair, we
never thought you'd find out.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.798
Sorry, James.
(chuckles)
It looks funny.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.866
I did it for
employee morale.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.435
Not yours, of course.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.936
If you were anyone but you,
you'd understand.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.738
Guys, I got a purse full
of licorice...

05:37.771 --> 05:38.706
What?

05:39.907 --> 05:42.576
Ooh! Mama mia!

05:42.610 --> 05:45.613
A-what-a Christmas is this!

05:45.646 --> 05:47.548
I got to go
to make-a de pizza.

05:50.984 --> 05:54.455
You think
he bought that?

05:54.488 --> 05:57.458
(slurring):
* Hark, the herald angels sing

05:57.491 --> 05:59.860
* Glory to the newborn king

05:59.893 --> 06:03.130
(slurring):
My family is mad at me,

06:03.163 --> 06:06.099
my friends are jerks...

06:06.133 --> 06:07.601
and now my daughter's gonna be

06:07.635 --> 06:09.670
the laughingstock
of the whole country!

06:09.703 --> 06:13.106
Your singing is the only thing
I haven't screwed up!

06:14.908 --> 06:17.578
And now I screwed that up
by talking...

06:17.611 --> 06:18.746
(grunts)

06:18.779 --> 06:19.847
(sighs)

06:23.116 --> 06:24.752
Thanks, Clarence.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.653
Mm-hmm.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.857
(spits)
I have some
announcements to make!

06:33.126 --> 06:35.763
Drunk Santa...

06:35.796 --> 06:38.932
karaoke guy...

06:38.966 --> 06:42.803
feel good because you have
made good decisions in life.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.473
And I did not. Why?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.608
Because I made sex

06:47.641 --> 06:50.444
with a serial killer
named Lucy

06:50.478 --> 06:52.145
in the back of my van,

06:52.179 --> 06:54.782
and now my life blows!

06:54.815 --> 06:57.184
Things would have been
so much better

06:57.217 --> 06:59.653
if hadn't picked up
Lucy in my van that night.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.523
You hear that,
disgusting Santa?

07:02.556 --> 07:07.495
I wish I had never picked up
Lucy in my van!

07:07.528 --> 07:08.796
Now, if you'll excuse me.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.030
(grunts)

07:23.977 --> 07:25.513
(grunts)

07:29.082 --> 07:32.653
Hey, where's Hope's crib?

07:34.087 --> 07:35.689
Where's my necklace?

07:35.723 --> 07:37.825
Your wish came true.

07:37.858 --> 07:41.128
You never picked up Lucy,
so she never got pregnant,

07:41.161 --> 07:42.863
and you don't have a daughter.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.231
What?!

07:44.264 --> 07:46.667
It's a Christmas miracle!
(laughs)

07:51.872 --> 07:54.775
Okay, Maw Maw, seriously,
where's Hope?

07:54.808 --> 07:55.809
Where's all her stuff?

07:55.843 --> 07:58.546
I told you,
there is no Hope.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.715
Ma?! Dad?!

08:01.749 --> 08:03.483
Mom?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.721
Why is there a shower
curtain hanging in here?

08:07.755 --> 08:09.222
Because your parents
are separated

08:09.256 --> 08:11.859
and Burt can't afford
a new place.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.894
Mom?!

08:13.927 --> 08:15.529
Dad?!

08:15.563 --> 08:18.065
Maw Maw's acting batty
and she hid Hope again!

08:18.098 --> 08:20.100
Don't turn on the oven!

08:20.133 --> 08:21.268
(Virginia coughing)

08:21.301 --> 08:23.771
Mom?! Dad?!

08:23.804 --> 08:25.305
Stop yelling!

08:25.338 --> 08:27.908
You're not the only one who got
hammered last night.

08:27.941 --> 08:31.078
Oh, Mom, you're huge!

08:31.111 --> 08:33.213
Are-are you having
an allergic reaction
to something?

08:35.248 --> 08:37.551
Yeah, I'm allergic
to fast food.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.187
If I eat more than 350 chicken
nuggets in a day,

08:40.220 --> 08:41.989
I blow up like a balloon.
(coughing)

08:44.124 --> 08:46.827
(sniffles)
Mmm.
What are you doing?
You quit smoking.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.562
Yep, three minutes ago.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.898
And now I'm starting again.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.265
Hmm. You be a dear, will ya?

08:52.299 --> 08:53.934
Get me a new cough rag.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.736
I can't find the white
spot on this one anywhere.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.809
Remember, you wished
you never slept with Lucy.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.310
Well, you got your wish,

09:03.343 --> 09:06.146
which means you
didn't have Hope,

09:06.179 --> 09:08.248
so she didn't need
to quit smoking.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.985
Hey, Jimmy, check it out!

09:13.787 --> 09:14.955
Got a hottie's digits!

09:14.988 --> 09:16.289
Read it and weep, cow.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.960
"555"?

09:19.993 --> 09:21.228
(sighs)

09:21.261 --> 09:23.130
It's fake.
It's a TV phone number.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.233
So? Maybe Jane D.'s
so hot she's on TV.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.868
Well, good for you.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.603
Just make sure you buy her
flowers when you pick her up

09:29.637 --> 09:31.338
at "123 Go Away Street."

09:33.306 --> 09:35.208
Well, at least
I'm out there
meeting people.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.177
I'm not spending my days
on the couch having

09:37.210 --> 09:38.311
a threesome
with Ben and Jerry.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.250
All part of your wish.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.887
I never wished for them
to be miserable like this.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.791
MAW MAW:
Without Hope in your life, you
had no purpose, no direction.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.726
You quit your part-time job.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.294
You became a full-time loser.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.899
And as you soon learned,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.702
being a full-time loser
didn't pay very well,

10:01.735 --> 10:03.370
so you resorted
to a life of crime...

10:03.403 --> 10:05.105
(whimpers)

10:05.138 --> 10:06.974
...which resulted in you
getting two prison tattoos

10:07.007 --> 10:09.209
and an addiction
to toilet wine.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.948
Instead of having
a cute baby to bond over,

10:14.982 --> 10:17.117
your parents argued
all the time,

10:17.150 --> 10:19.787
blaming each other
for the mess you became.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.288
No, this can't be true.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.758
Maybe I'm still dreaming.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.293
Oh, this is just like
that movie Inception.

10:26.326 --> 10:29.096
I have absolutely no idea
what's going on.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.964
Why are you standing in the
middle of the room talking

10:30.998 --> 10:32.332
to yourself like
a crazy person?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.334
I'm not crazy.
I'm just talking to Maw Maw.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.837
Oh, so you're talking
to ghosts now?

10:36.870 --> 10:41.141
If I still loved you, this would
be very disappointing.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.676
Oh, did I not mention
I'm dead?

10:42.710 --> 10:44.077
That's your fault, too.

10:44.111 --> 10:47.080
It was the night your mother
sent you out for ice cream.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.448
Instead of a cold
sugary treat...

10:48.481 --> 10:50.183
Help!

10:50.217 --> 10:52.720
...you brought home
a cold-blooded killer.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.859
You're like a hero.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.761
Well, this is fantastic.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.430
But since you didn't
pick up Lucy,

11:03.463 --> 11:05.833
of course,
none of that happened.

11:09.870 --> 11:13.140
MAW MAW:
So, you gave an old lady treats
filled with choking hazards.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.441
(groaning)

11:17.277 --> 11:19.346
Truth is, you did me a favor.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.714
Oh, heaven's great.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.015
Though it's awfully hot there.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.350
There are a lot of
fires everywhere...

11:23.383 --> 11:25.085
And last night at karaoke?

11:25.118 --> 11:28.856
Idi Amin and Hitler did a great
version of "Ebony and Ivory."

11:28.889 --> 11:30.924
No, no, no.
Oh.

11:30.958 --> 11:34.728
Jimmy! I need somebody to
shave me down, oil me up,

11:34.762 --> 11:37.364
and take some sexy pics for
my online dating profile.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.365
This isn't happening.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.067
None of this is happening!

11:40.100 --> 11:41.168
I gotta get
out of here.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.807
Hey, porky, get out here and
stand next to me for a picture.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.509
I want to look skinny for
my online dating profile.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.444
(coughing, hacking)

12:04.892 --> 12:06.159
No.

12:19.973 --> 12:23.143
Barney's new girlfriend
is really into money.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.413
She made him buy this place
and change it into this.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.282
Nothing makes more money than
sexy girls selling liquor.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.318
(sloppy ukulele music plays)

12:31.351 --> 12:33.386
* Would you like me
to lick your shoes? *

12:33.420 --> 12:35.255
* I'll do anything
for booze *

12:35.288 --> 12:37.991
* If you want to cop a feel-a

12:38.025 --> 12:40.360
* Just buy me cheap tequila.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.962
What happened to Shelley?

12:43.563 --> 12:45.398
You did.

12:45.432 --> 12:49.469
'Cause you didn't have Hope,
you never brought those parents

12:49.502 --> 12:52.072
from that snobby private
school to save day care.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.107
Then she started
stealing medicine

12:54.141 --> 12:56.143
from old people
and dogs.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.946
Now she's hooked
on cheap wine,

12:58.979 --> 13:00.447
stool softeners, and...

13:00.480 --> 13:01.849
heart-worm pills.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.088
What the hell?

13:08.121 --> 13:11.058
Without you working with him,
Frank became mayor.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.100
I'm thinking of
running for mayor.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.368
That's stupid.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.870
Yeah, you're right.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.407
Is that Sabrina?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.209
85% of that girl

13:29.242 --> 13:32.012
is what you
remember as Sabrina.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.915
Hey, Sabrina.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.017
It's Sapphire now.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.389
Ten bucks to see 'em,
20 bucks to feel 'em,

13:42.422 --> 13:44.157
50 bucks for the greatest
motorboat of your life.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.326
No, it's me--
uh, uh... Jimmy.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.494
Well, I'll tell
you what, Jimmy.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.929
You're cute.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.063
I'll tell you what
you can get for 100 bucks.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.634
ATM's in the corner.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.036
Think about it, hmm?

14:00.540 --> 14:03.944
Working in a dump like this
really changed Sabrina.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.279
Course, it'd still
be good old Howdy's

14:06.313 --> 14:07.948
if it weren't for
Barney's new girlfriend.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.082
Which is also your fault.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.418
Well, how could that
possibly be my fault?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.053
Where is my boyfriend?

14:13.086 --> 14:14.621
Barney's girlfriend is Lucy?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.189
Right here, sweetie.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.424
(sighs)
I ran out of money again.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.591
Oh, well...

14:18.625 --> 14:20.260
(cash register beeps)

14:20.293 --> 14:22.429
Since you didn't
sleep with her,

14:22.462 --> 14:25.398
and Virginia didn't
knock her out with the TV,

14:25.432 --> 14:27.300
she never got caught,

14:27.334 --> 14:29.169
and was free
to find other prey.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.403
Other prey?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.305
Oh, my God,
she's going to kill him.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.441
Good.
Never been a fan.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.544
But if you like him so much,
call the cops. Although...

14:37.577 --> 14:40.547
if you want your daughter,
better get Lucy pregnant first.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.115
You're right.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.616
I gotta knock her up.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.034
(shouts)
What are you still
doing here, dirtbag ?

15:01.068 --> 15:02.402
You looking to rob the place?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.405
What are you
looking at her for?

15:05.438 --> 15:06.506
You think she's
prettier than me?

15:06.539 --> 15:07.640
Huh?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.509
Think these were
a waste of money?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.978
No, no!
They're worth every penny!

15:11.011 --> 15:12.245
Please, I need your help.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.513
Why would I help you?

15:13.546 --> 15:15.348
Because underneath
that 30 pounds of

15:15.382 --> 15:17.184
perfectly molded silicone,

15:17.217 --> 15:19.552
I know there's the heart
of a good person.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.688
God, I wish I had $20.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.290
(grunts)

15:23.323 --> 15:25.258
That was the nicest thing
anybody's said to me in years.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.095
What do you
need me to do?

15:30.363 --> 15:33.200
Are you a good enough shot
to just miss somebody?

15:35.335 --> 15:36.269
Hey, Lucy.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.041
I just found out you're
"The Boyfriend Killer."

15:49.216 --> 15:51.318
Help! Help!

15:54.154 --> 15:56.156
Drive! Drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive!

16:05.765 --> 16:07.467
(grunting)

16:07.500 --> 16:09.736
Do you have a condom?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.338
I'm so not getting pregnant.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.339
Uh... I'll be careful.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.307
I'm not taking any chances.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.443
I got off all my meds
a few weeks ago--

16:16.476 --> 16:18.345
birth control pills,
antidepressants,

16:18.378 --> 16:20.513
anti-psychotics,
mood stabilizers...

16:20.547 --> 16:23.616
I'm actually feeling a lot
more clear-headed these days.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.585
Now go get a damn condom!
(grunts)

16:27.354 --> 16:29.122
Open the drawer...

16:29.156 --> 16:30.157
dig around...

16:30.190 --> 16:31.124
close the drawer.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.192
Okay.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.662
Open the cabinet...

16:35.695 --> 16:37.497
What are you doing?

16:37.530 --> 16:39.332
I'm just trying to figure out
how long it would take for me

16:39.366 --> 16:40.267
to realistically be
looking for a condom.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.702
Well, at least one of us
is having sex...

16:42.735 --> 16:44.104
with other people, I mean.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.438
(laughs)

16:45.472 --> 16:49.776
Say, Jimmy, do any of your
no-good, punk friends

16:49.809 --> 16:51.544
feel like doing
an old gal a favor?

16:51.578 --> 16:52.612
I'll ask around.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.215
Hmm.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.520
(grunts)

17:02.655 --> 17:05.125
Whoa, whoa!
What the hell are you doing?

17:05.158 --> 17:06.826
Sorry, he's kind of
hot for an old guy.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.395
Dad, I was hooking up with her.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.130
I just went to
look for a condom.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.798
Oh, good.
Hand it over.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.766
She looks iffy.
You smell like beef jerky.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.202
Oh, that's just the van, baby.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.636
Dad, would you get out of here?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.272
I had her first.
Well, I have her now.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.374
All right, you guys decide.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.110
And maybe raid
the kitchen.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.678
I kind of got a hankering
for beef jerky.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.115
You can't have sex with her.
I need to.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.382
Well, I want to.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.517
You want to have a pose-off?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.319
Top this.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.686
I'm telling Mom about this.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.788
Mom!

17:35.822 --> 17:38.491
JIMMY:
Mom! Mom!

17:38.525 --> 17:40.427
Dad's trying to hook up
with the girl I like

17:40.460 --> 17:41.761
right here in the yard.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.596
I don't care.
Long as he doesn't do it

17:43.630 --> 17:45.832
on my side of the bed.
Well, that's fine.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.400
I was thinking about
using the hammock.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.136
Remember the days you
wouldn't break the hammock?

17:49.169 --> 17:51.204
Dad, you don't understand
how important this is.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.872
There's only one way
to decide who gets her.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.806
Rock, paper, scissors.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.509
I want in on this, too.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.644
(sniffles)

17:57.677 --> 17:58.845
I'm sick of men.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.282
(groaning)

18:03.716 --> 18:05.585
(making alarm sounds)

18:09.189 --> 18:12.125
Thank you, Dan,
my newly appointed

18:12.159 --> 18:13.860
Secretary of Alarm Sounds.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.496
My fellow Natesvillians,

18:16.529 --> 18:19.199
we have identified
"The Boyfriend Killer."

18:19.232 --> 18:21.634
Her name is Lucy Carlyle.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.803
If you should
encounter the suspect,

18:23.836 --> 18:25.672
remember, she may look sweet,

18:25.705 --> 18:27.640
but she is extremely dangerous.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.109
(making alarm sounds)

18:31.711 --> 18:34.581
Hey, you guys are out of toilet
paper and painkillers.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.585
No! I'll never get Hope back!

18:38.618 --> 18:40.853
(in slow-motion):
No...!

18:45.425 --> 18:46.593
(gasps)

18:49.562 --> 18:52.465
* Hark, the herald angels sing

18:52.499 --> 18:55.402
* Glory to the newborn king

18:55.435 --> 18:57.737
* Peace on earth,
and mercy mild... *

18:57.770 --> 18:59.372
I'm back.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.707
I'm back!

19:00.740 --> 19:03.443
Merry Christmas,
drunk Santa!

19:03.476 --> 19:06.879
Merry Christmas,
public domain karaoke singer!

19:06.913 --> 19:08.848
(laughs)

19:10.250 --> 19:14.754
Merry Christmas, Natesville!

19:14.787 --> 19:16.689
Merry Christmas, Dancin' Dan!

19:16.723 --> 19:18.325
It's Christmas?

19:18.358 --> 19:20.727
JIMMY:
Merry Christmas, movie theater!

19:20.760 --> 19:23.396
Merry Christmas, people who
I thought were my friends but

19:23.430 --> 19:24.631
are inside the movie theater!

19:25.932 --> 19:26.766
(grunts)

19:27.967 --> 19:29.836
Merry Christmas,

19:29.869 --> 19:32.239
uneven sidewalk!

19:33.340 --> 19:34.140
(sighs)

19:35.842 --> 19:38.211
(grunts)
Merry Christmas,
Mom and Dad!

19:38.245 --> 19:39.579
Where's Hope?

19:39.612 --> 19:40.980
(Hope crying)

19:41.013 --> 19:42.915
She w asleep.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.717
It's 10:30 at night,
what's wrong with you?

19:44.751 --> 19:46.653
That's our Christmas tree?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.455
What, did you mug
Charlie Brown?
(chuckles)

19:49.856 --> 19:51.724
Hope! Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.361
And Maw Maw, you're alive!

19:54.394 --> 19:55.728
Of course I'm alive.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.364
Heaven's gonna have to wait

19:57.397 --> 19:59.599
a little bit longer for me.
Yeah, yeah, heaven.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.001
I'm so sorry I called
you guys stupid.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.970
I'm glad I grew up
in a stupid house.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.539
Every stupid decision I've made
in life has led to great things.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.441
I mean, I wouldn't have
Hope if-if I wasn't an idiot.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.009
And I wouldn't trade her
for anything.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.444
(knocking at door)

20:11.478 --> 20:12.745
I'm just glad I'm
back in reality.

20:14.013 --> 20:14.947
Hey.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.286
Well, there are a couple
of things I miss.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.654
I thought you guys
were at the movies.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.922
We left early.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.558
(laughing)

20:25.592 --> 20:29.462
MAN:
Can you believe these morons
actually live in our town?

20:29.496 --> 20:32.599
WOMAN:
The baby's probably just
as stupid as the rest of them.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.534
I can't sit and listen
to this anymore.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.369
We've gotta
do something.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.704
I know there's some
historical precedence

20:37.737 --> 20:39.406
for not doing this, but...

20:39.439 --> 20:41.774
Fire!
(gasping)

20:41.808 --> 20:43.843
Wow.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.578
You guys are good friends.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.946
I mean, you would've been
great friends if you hadn't

20:46.979 --> 20:48.515
gone to the movies when
I asked you not to.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.450
But now I'm
glad you're here.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.585
I wouldn't worry
about that movie, Jimmy.
(chuckles)

20:52.619 --> 20:55.322
A poor family raising
a serial killer's baby?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.923
Not many people are
gonna want to watch that.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.458
At least not in
my demographic.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.796
JIMMY:
I wasn't going to be able to
protect Hope from the reality

21:03.830 --> 21:05.998
of how she came
to be in this world.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.067
What happened, happened.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.370
And nothing was
going to change that.

21:10.403 --> 21:13.440
And I wouldn't change it,
for anything in the world.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.542
Maybe me spending
most of Christmas Eve

21:15.575 --> 21:17.610
passed out in a bar
deprived Hope

21:17.644 --> 21:19.412
of seeing that Jimmy Stewart
movie everyone loves

21:19.446 --> 21:21.981
for another year,
but at least I could teach Hope

21:22.014 --> 21:24.083
the lesson I learned:

21:24.116 --> 21:26.953
You can't worry about how
the whole world sees you...

21:26.986 --> 21:29.756
It only matters how the people
in your world see you.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.361
Oh, and don't ever sign
for a beach ball.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.831
CHILD:
Happy Holidays!
