WEBVTT

00:00.579 --> 00:02.513
All right, we're British
and we're on vacation.

00:02.581 --> 00:05.215
- Give me your best Mick Jagger.
- Take the picture, Toby.

00:05.283 --> 00:06.884
Yeah! Give it to me.
Give it to-- Come on,

00:06.951 --> 00:09.319
just give it to the camera.
(laughing)

00:09.387 --> 00:10.899
- Ehh...
- Oh, that's good.

00:11.019 --> 00:14.141
- You look great. You look good.
- It's good. This is really nice--

00:14.236 --> 00:18.038
pineapples, seafood salad.
- Great company.

00:18.106 --> 00:20.406
Why don't we do
this more often?

00:20.474 --> 00:24.410
IIB, EMS, ER, probably a few other
acronyms I can't remember right now.

00:24.478 --> 00:27.647
- When did we get so busy?
- I don't know. I don't know.

00:27.715 --> 00:29.582
One minute I'm riding
on the ambulance with Oz,

00:29.650 --> 00:31.584
listening to terrible jokes.

00:31.652 --> 00:34.319
Next thing you know, I'm chasing
bad dudes all over town.

00:34.387 --> 00:36.688
- What is that?
- And my life

00:36.757 --> 00:39.591
as a carefree intern turned
into 18-hour days

00:39.659 --> 00:41.927
in an overcrowded,
under-funded ER.

00:41.995 --> 00:44.263
These are the days
of our lives.

00:44.330 --> 00:47.266
(she laughs)
That's bad.

00:47.333 --> 00:50.534
Ah. But we have
a 1st of July picnic.

00:50.602 --> 00:54.172
- Nyeh, even if it gets bumped till December.
- Mm-hmm.

00:56.275 --> 00:58.209
I gotta go back to work.

00:58.277 --> 01:01.045
I know. Me too.
(she sighs)

01:01.113 --> 01:04.015
You know, what, life is too short, Liv.
We gotta keep stealing these moments.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.950
- I know. You're right. Tell you what.
- You know that.

01:07.018 --> 01:08.852
- What?
- How about we make a date

01:08.920 --> 01:12.256
- for Christmas dinner?
- All right, you're on.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.291
- Good.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14.358 --> 01:16.260
- Have a good one.
- You too.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.561
- Sir Toby.
- Bon voyage.

01:18.629 --> 01:20.798
See you later.

01:20.865 --> 01:23.699
<i>Dr. Forest,</i>
<i>dial 1-8-2, please.</i>

01:23.767 --> 01:25.434
<i>Dr. Forest, please dial...</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:27.970
- Hey, Oz. What's up?
- Hey. Car accident.

01:28.038 --> 01:30.139
Nicked his femoral artery.
I was able to suppress it

01:30.207 --> 01:32.241
and clean it up, but I couldn't
shut down the bleeding.

01:32.309 --> 01:36.145
OK, Oz, we need to get him into
surgery as soon as possible.

01:36.213 --> 01:38.280
You gotta help my friend.

01:38.347 --> 01:41.716
- Excuse me. I was here first.
- OK, we'll get to everyone.

01:41.784 --> 01:44.119
He's real sick.
You gotta do something.

01:44.187 --> 01:49.257
(coughing)
Uh, can you get a cart?

01:49.325 --> 01:51.927
All right, what is your friend's
name? We'll get him checked in.

01:51.994 --> 01:54.695
- Karl Stiles.
- OK, sir, how long has he felt like this?

01:54.762 --> 01:57.064
- He was fine this afternoon.
- Karl,

01:57.132 --> 02:00.534
did you eat anything different? Have you
been anywhere where people are sick?

02:00.601 --> 02:03.670
They're gonna kill people.
(coughing)

02:03.738 --> 02:07.074
- Hey, I need assistance!
- Go, go, go.

02:07.142 --> 02:09.776
Sir?

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.722 --> 02:24.523
He's going into shock.
And I've got no pulse.

02:24.591 --> 02:26.825
We need a defib, stat!

02:26.893 --> 02:29.594
[Old man]: Help... me.
(old man coughing)

02:31.865 --> 02:35.167
Take over.

02:35.235 --> 02:37.836
Clear.

02:37.904 --> 02:39.938
- Sandy?
- Yeah.

02:40.006 --> 02:41.873
- Is he with them?
- No.

02:41.940 --> 02:43.975
- How long has he been here?
- Uh, five, six hours.

02:44.042 --> 02:46.844
OK, get him a bed, start it on
analgesics, and, uh, Ribavirin drip.

02:46.912 --> 02:48.812
OK. Sir, you want
to come with me?

02:48.881 --> 02:51.749
(coughing)

02:51.816 --> 02:54.718
- Call a Code Orange.
- Olivia, what's going on?

02:54.786 --> 02:57.454
Some kind
of haemorrhaging fever.

02:57.522 --> 03:01.424
Whatever this is, it's viral, and it's
been transmitted within a six-hour window.

03:01.492 --> 03:04.310
Everyone in this ER could
be infected.

03:05.930 --> 03:16.502
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:29.655 --> 03:31.264
I alerted Public Health

03:31.395 --> 03:33.329
as soon as I realized
what we might be facing.

03:33.397 --> 03:35.331
Well, hopefully your quick
response will have prevented

03:35.399 --> 03:36.865
a greater outbreak.

03:36.933 --> 03:39.067
Having said that--
thank you--

03:39.135 --> 03:43.539
I've already received three
calls since you contacted us.

03:43.606 --> 03:46.508
Newly infected patients are
going to be rerouted

03:46.576 --> 03:48.944
to a mobile triage centre
we've established.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.946
What's the status of your
patients currently infected?

03:52.013 --> 03:53.481
Well, one is dead,

03:53.549 --> 03:55.883
and two others are
in very serious condition.

03:55.951 --> 03:58.519
The older patient must have
contracted the virus within the

03:58.587 --> 04:00.154
last six hours of being here.

04:00.221 --> 04:02.889
Yeah, I checked his records.
Weakened immune system.

04:02.958 --> 04:05.059
Doesn't give us
a clear timeline

04:05.126 --> 04:07.061
as to the speed
of the infection.

04:07.128 --> 04:09.029
I mean, what about clues
from your patients

04:09.097 --> 04:11.031
as to how the virus was
transmitted?

04:11.099 --> 04:12.766
None that we can find.

04:12.834 --> 04:15.269
I mean, the latest patient said
he had no contact with them.

04:15.337 --> 04:18.536
It could be anything, really.
It could be...

04:18.605 --> 04:20.673
as simple as drinking
from a water fountain,

04:20.740 --> 04:24.344
touching a surface the original
patients might have touched.

04:24.411 --> 04:27.546
Worst-case scenario,
it's an airborne infection.

04:27.614 --> 04:29.648
- OK, what's next?
- We turn triage

04:29.716 --> 04:32.318
into an isolation ward
for further patients

04:32.386 --> 04:34.619
- that might contract the virus.
- And what about visitors?

04:34.687 --> 04:36.121
Other patients in Emerg?

04:36.189 --> 04:38.590
We keep them calm.

04:38.657 --> 04:41.326
I'll inform the staff.

04:47.833 --> 04:50.434
Well, we've pulled in
a quarter of a million

04:50.502 --> 04:52.503
in bogus hundreds
over the last few weeks.

04:52.570 --> 04:54.771
We know the areas they're
working; we just have to get

04:54.839 --> 04:56.740
people in the stores and
watching for them to be passed.

04:56.808 --> 04:58.642
We follow our way up the chain
to figure out

04:58.710 --> 05:00.811
- who's making these bad boys.
- I know who's making them:

05:00.879 --> 05:03.047
Matt Morganstern.
We just need the proof.

05:03.115 --> 05:05.415
(cell phone ringing)
Hold on a sec.

05:05.483 --> 05:06.916
Hey, what's going on?

05:06.984 --> 05:08.985
I leave some seafood salad
on your files?

05:09.053 --> 05:10.253
No, we've got trouble. They've

05:10.321 --> 05:13.223
- put the ER into lockdown.
- What?

05:13.290 --> 05:15.525
<i>Three people have come down</i>
<i>with this mysterious fever.</i>

05:15.592 --> 05:19.195
- One of them has died, and two others are failing.
- You're kidding me. Are you OK?

05:19.263 --> 05:21.131
<i>Yeah, we're fine for now.</i>
<i>I just</i>

05:21.198 --> 05:24.066
wanted you to know
in case you feel any symptoms--

05:24.134 --> 05:27.269
coughing, wheezing, anything,
you just, you have to call me.

05:27.337 --> 05:29.405
Hey. Um, are you in charge?

05:29.472 --> 05:32.041
- Ma'am, I'll just be a minute.
- They won't let us leave, uh,

05:32.108 --> 05:34.911
- so what's going on?
- We're having a problem. I'll explain everything in--

05:34.978 --> 05:36.913
- You know what, it's been a really long night,
so I really have to get my daughter home--

05:36.980 --> 05:39.313
- Toby, I have to go.
- Liv, I'm coming down.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.250
- I'll be there in a few minutes.
- No, coming here is a bad idea.

05:42.317 --> 05:45.587
Toby. Toby?

05:45.655 --> 05:47.923
- Hey, what's going on?
- St. Luke's is in lockdown.

05:47.990 --> 05:49.457
There's some kind of fever.

05:49.525 --> 05:51.526
Three people are sick,
one person has died already.

05:51.594 --> 05:52.928
So, what can you do?

05:52.995 --> 05:54.862
I can be there.
My friends are stuck in there.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.463
I'll call you.

06:00.101 --> 06:05.138
<i>We have initiated lockdown</i>
<i>procedure. Please remain calm.</i>

06:05.206 --> 06:09.276
<i>This is a precautionary measure.</i>
<i>Nurses will supply further instruction.</i>

06:12.846 --> 06:14.714
No ID, but he says

06:14.782 --> 06:16.950
- his name is Tyler Ross.
- Has he said anything else?

06:17.017 --> 06:20.720
- Nothing that makes any sense.
- Mr. Ross, I'm Dr. Fawcett.

06:20.788 --> 06:22.755
I have to ask you
some questions.

06:22.823 --> 06:24.924
I'm sick.
You gotta help me.

06:24.992 --> 06:28.093
Were you and your friend anywhere
where someone else was sick?

06:28.160 --> 06:30.862
- Where's Karl?
- Tyler, Karl didn't make it,

06:30.930 --> 06:33.765
but if we're going to help you, we
need to know what you were exposed to.

06:33.833 --> 06:38.036
Nothing.
We just had some drinks.

06:38.104 --> 06:41.006
Karl said something about someone wanted
to kill people. What did he mean?

06:41.074 --> 06:45.610
I don't know.
It's cold.

06:47.646 --> 06:51.381
Get him into a room.
Ribavirin drip. Analgesics.

06:51.449 --> 06:53.383
All right, I've sent

06:53.451 --> 06:56.120
both men's blood off
for microbial, serological,

06:56.187 --> 06:59.255
and molecular diagnostic tests, and
we've begun the autopsy on Karl.

06:59.323 --> 07:01.257
- And?
- You were right.

07:01.325 --> 07:02.792
Haemorrhagic fever.

07:02.860 --> 07:05.328
His internal organs were
severely compromised.

07:05.395 --> 07:09.465
- I've got him on Ribavirin, and we have antivirals on order.
- Meanwhile, keep them hydrated,

07:09.533 --> 07:12.368
try compresses, just do anything
you can to keep them comfortable.

07:12.436 --> 07:15.570
There's not much else we can do,
really, not until my team

07:15.639 --> 07:17.973
- tracks down patient zero.
- All right, thank you.

07:22.445 --> 07:26.015
(crowd of people talking)

07:26.082 --> 07:29.551
Thank you. Hey, Oz. I'm out
in front of the hospital, man.

07:29.619 --> 07:33.587
Can you grab Liv
and come out here?

07:33.656 --> 07:35.990
- <i>So, you got stuck in there, huh?</i>
<i>- Yeah, can you believe that?</i>

07:36.058 --> 07:38.192
This guy died, man. He's got
a virus that's brutal.

07:38.260 --> 07:42.363
He bled everywhere, he coughed on Liv. It's
not good, man. They're locking us down.

07:42.430 --> 07:45.133
- Are you OK?
<i>- I'm OK. I gotta go. Here.</i>

07:45.200 --> 07:47.567
- All right, thanks.
<i>- Hey.</i>

07:47.635 --> 07:50.503
<i>- Liv, what's happening?
- Public Health is investigating everyone that's been infected.</i>

07:50.571 --> 07:52.472
If we can figure out
where the virus came from,

07:52.540 --> 07:54.074
we could save weeks
of trying to isolate it.

07:54.142 --> 07:55.942
<i>What do we know</i>
<i>about the victim?</i>

07:56.010 --> 07:58.145
The one who died was Karl
Stiles.<i>His friend, Tyler Ross,</i>

07:58.212 --> 08:01.347
said they were having drinks. We couldn't get
anything else out of him. But Karl did say

08:01.415 --> 08:04.717
before he died that somebody
was trying to kill people.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.987
<i>- What does that mean? - I don't know. He was feverish.
- I should be in there with you.</i>

08:08.055 --> 08:10.255
I don't want you involved
more than you need to be.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.424
Public Health has it
under control.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.326
<i>You know that I can get</i>
<i>information that they can't.</i>

08:14.394 --> 08:16.062
<i>I should be in there with you</i>
<i>right now, Liv.</i>

08:16.129 --> 08:18.196
I don't want you taking
that chance. We don't know

08:18.263 --> 08:20.298
what this infection is
or how it's transmitted.

08:20.365 --> 08:24.736
<i>Look, I'm going to get IIB</i>
<i>to run profiles on these guys,</i>

08:24.804 --> 08:28.039
<i>OK? Um, see if we can piece</i>
<i>together their last few hours.</i>

08:28.107 --> 08:31.076
<i>If anything changes,</i>
<i>you let me know.</i>

08:31.143 --> 08:33.244
<i>- I promise.</i>
<i>- OK.</i>

08:40.418 --> 08:42.586
Hey, Michelle, I need a favour.

08:45.223 --> 08:47.157
Well, Dev's team checked out

08:47.225 --> 08:50.127
Tyler's place. The landlord said
he hasn't been there all day.

08:50.195 --> 08:52.895
- They find anything?
- Yeah, some day-old pizza

08:52.963 --> 08:55.898
and a bunch of videogames.

08:55.966 --> 08:57.900
OK. Well, look,

08:57.968 --> 08:59.603
put this mask on.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.572
We can't take any chances.
We don't know what this is yet.

09:10.347 --> 09:12.514
Looks like Karl does
pretty well for himself.

09:12.582 --> 09:14.516
Yeah, no kidding.

09:19.489 --> 09:21.423
No pictures,

09:21.491 --> 09:24.259
no personal possessions,

09:24.326 --> 09:26.694
no bills.

09:26.762 --> 09:29.297
It's like he's living
under the radar.

09:31.933 --> 09:33.434
His computer just locked.

09:33.502 --> 09:36.137
I'm sure Dev can
work his magic on it.

09:40.508 --> 09:43.977
Dr. Fawcett, this is Dr. Marette.
She's with Forster BioMed.

09:44.044 --> 09:46.446
Public Health has reached out
to biotech companies

09:46.514 --> 09:49.316
specializing in virus research,
and Dr. Marette's is

09:49.384 --> 09:51.518
one of the firms
who have stepped up to help.

09:51.586 --> 09:54.254
She's going to coordinate
the other company's involvement.

09:54.321 --> 09:55.888
I understand there's been
other victims?

09:55.955 --> 09:57.723
Yeah, four more
across the downtown area;

09:57.791 --> 09:59.825
two more hospitals have gone
into lockdown.

09:59.893 --> 10:03.028
Have you been provided with blood
samples from the infected patients?

10:03.096 --> 10:05.264
Absolutely. Our lab is
isolating the virus as we speak.

10:05.332 --> 10:08.267
- OK, I need a timeframe.
- Well, we're trying to condense a month's work

10:08.335 --> 10:10.702
into a few short hours.
If we had a pure sample of the

10:10.770 --> 10:13.505
live virus, we could isolate it
immediately, but we may need

10:13.572 --> 10:16.574
- a day or two for the anti-virus.
- Some of these people don't have a day or two.

10:16.642 --> 10:19.076
We're doing everything we can.
I promise.

10:19.144 --> 10:22.213
<i>Code Blue. Code Blue.</i>

10:22.281 --> 10:24.916
(monitors beeping)
We don't have a pulse.

10:24.983 --> 10:28.652
One milligram epinephrine,
stat.

10:34.859 --> 10:36.794
Still no pulse.
One more milligram.

10:48.405 --> 10:50.473
(she sighs)

10:50.541 --> 10:54.610
<i>Dr. Lisa Cavalier to ICU.</i>
<i>Dr. Lisa Cavalier, please call ICU.</i>

10:55.613 --> 10:58.753
He had no prior history with the
victims outside the hospital.

10:59.019 --> 11:01.489
And we still don't know
whether or not this is airborne.

11:03.419 --> 11:05.721
I'm afraid we do.

11:26.325 --> 11:28.560
What gives, Liv?
You're supposed to be resting.

11:28.627 --> 11:31.763
I started early on the antivirals.
We'll nip it in the bud.

11:31.831 --> 11:36.501
Graham's situation went from
infection to death within 12 hours.

11:36.569 --> 11:38.435
If we're going to give
these people any more time,

11:38.503 --> 11:41.371
I need to keep working.

11:41.439 --> 11:43.874
Listen, can you do me a favour

11:43.942 --> 11:46.944
and help Sandy keep people calm out there?
I can't do anything from in here.

11:47.011 --> 11:49.112
OK, but can you please
just take care of yourself?

11:49.180 --> 11:52.082
You're currently the only doctor that doesn't
run the other way when they see me coming.

11:52.149 --> 11:54.083
I didn't know
that was an option.

11:54.150 --> 11:57.487
(they chuckle)
I'll be fine.

11:57.554 --> 11:59.054
Really.

12:06.597 --> 12:08.361
So, I've been looking
into the first two guys

12:08.362 --> 12:10.198
that showed up at the
hospital, starting with...

12:10.265 --> 12:13.134
Tyler Ross:
no criminal record,

12:13.202 --> 12:15.937
he's worked at the same shipping
firm for the last three years.

12:16.005 --> 12:19.340
- His boss says that he's Employee of the Month material.
- So was he at work?

12:19.408 --> 12:21.376
No, it was his day off.
And we have to assume

12:21.443 --> 12:24.980
that he spent a good chunk of it
with his friend... Karl Stiles.

12:25.047 --> 12:27.047
Now, Karl's a whole
different story.

12:27.115 --> 12:30.384
He did a little time for a series of
burglaries in swank homes in Rosedale

12:30.451 --> 12:33.220
- a few years back.
- So, what are you thinking?

12:33.287 --> 12:35.656
Karl, he's still robbing houses,
goes into one,

12:35.724 --> 12:37.725
contracts a virus,
maybe gives it to Tyler?

12:37.792 --> 12:40.127
Patient zero could
still be there.

12:40.194 --> 12:43.863
Whatever is on Karl's hard drive might give
us the answers as to what he was doing.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.634
Well, he really, really didn't want anyone
seeing what's on this thing. I mean,

12:47.701 --> 12:50.369
it is iced up with full-on
military-grade encryption.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.438
You have a whole hour
to crack it, Dev.

12:52.506 --> 12:54.007
I have faith in you.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.078
No pressure.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.613
I'm not sick.

13:01.681 --> 13:04.683
Listen, I-I can't be sick.
I didn't touch anything.

13:04.751 --> 13:08.153
- I didn't even talk to them.
- Lie back.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.155
Whatever this is
travels through the air,

13:10.222 --> 13:12.758
and I'm sorry, you are
displaying signs of infection.

13:12.825 --> 13:14.859
What does that mean?

13:17.429 --> 13:20.064
(woman laughs)
That I'm gonna die?

13:20.131 --> 13:24.334
We don't know what this is. But we are
going to take very good care of you.

13:34.144 --> 13:36.512
You gotta get my daughter
out of here.

13:36.581 --> 13:39.515
She might be infected too.
The next few hours will tell.

13:39.584 --> 13:42.652
Listen, she broke her arm, OK? She
shouldn't have to die from that.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.154
Listen, we're looking for an antiviral, and
we're hoping to get it by the morning.

13:46.222 --> 13:49.391
What if you don't? I mean, what
if my daughter were to get sick?

13:49.459 --> 13:52.494
You need to take good care
of yourself right now and rest.

13:52.562 --> 13:54.763
We're doing everything
that we can.

14:14.650 --> 14:17.518
Can I interest you
in a snack, m'lady?

14:17.586 --> 14:19.519
How's my mom doing?

14:19.587 --> 14:21.888
Oh, she's good. She's good.
She's, uh,

14:21.956 --> 14:24.625
she's fine. They're just making sure
she stays comfortable in there.

14:24.692 --> 14:27.027
Is she gonna die
like the other people?

14:27.095 --> 14:30.797
Whoa, whoa, hey, listen,
don't even think about that, OK?

14:30.865 --> 14:34.233
The doctors and the nurses here are the best
in the business. She's gonna be just fine.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.103
You're just saying that.
You don't believe it.

14:37.170 --> 14:39.772
You see my face right now?
Do you see my believing face?

14:39.840 --> 14:42.241
This is my believing face.
You ready?

14:42.308 --> 14:45.945
See the belief? Do you see all the
belief there? All right? Here,

14:46.013 --> 14:50.682
come on. Almonds, crackers with some sort
of cheese in them. What do you like?

14:50.750 --> 14:52.917
Yeah, right to the cookie?

14:52.985 --> 14:54.986
I should have known. All right,
can you keep on these, make sure

14:55.054 --> 14:57.555
that there's no cookie monsters
running around? OK?

14:57.623 --> 14:59.457
All right.

15:06.197 --> 15:09.499
- Hey, how you holding up?
- Oh, still on the right side of the barrier. You?

15:09.567 --> 15:12.369
Well, it's not exactly how I thought
I'd be spending my evening, but, uh--

15:12.436 --> 15:14.504
- Yeah, I'm looking forward
to catching up with that.

15:14.572 --> 15:17.407
- I bet you wish you stayed in Africa.
- There's diseases everywhere.

15:17.475 --> 15:19.710
If I'm gonna get sick,
I'm glad I'm with you.

15:19.778 --> 15:22.945
Thanks.
I think.

15:23.013 --> 15:26.816
(Liv coughing)

15:33.757 --> 15:37.560
I've got an open communication with
Public Health and the CDC in Atlanta.

15:37.627 --> 15:39.627
They're routing bulletins
from all over the world.

15:39.696 --> 15:42.698
There are no other reports of this
infection outside of this city.

15:42.765 --> 15:46.835
OK, so Karl and Tyler and the others either
contracted this from patient zero...

15:46.903 --> 15:48.804
Or maybe one of them IS
patient zero.

15:48.871 --> 15:50.605
Yeah. We need another
way into these guys.

15:50.673 --> 15:52.540
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

15:52.608 --> 15:56.177
- You need to read Tyler.
- Yeah.

16:00.381 --> 16:02.850
Well, hopefully his mind is
still sharp enough

16:02.918 --> 16:04.985
to remember where he's been.
(cell phone ringing)

16:05.053 --> 16:07.554
- Sorry. I've got to take this.
- OK.

16:10.825 --> 16:13.693
- You're going in there?
- Yeah.

16:13.761 --> 16:17.430
You've got to find out about my husband. He's inside.
He called and said he came down

16:17.497 --> 16:19.999
here for stitches,
then he never came home.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.668
- They said people are sick in there, that they can't leave.
- If your husband's in there,

16:22.737 --> 16:24.437
he's going to be OK.
They're taking care of it.

16:24.504 --> 16:26.605
Yeah, that's why
you're dressed like that.

16:26.672 --> 16:29.108
My friends are in there.
They're doing what they can.

16:29.175 --> 16:30.709
It's gonna be OK.

16:37.550 --> 16:40.285
I almost wore the exact same thing to work today.
That would have been awkward.

16:40.353 --> 16:43.755
- How's it going?
- Ah, not great, actually.

16:43.822 --> 16:45.923
Um, Liv, uh...

16:45.991 --> 16:48.826
I've been telling her to take it easy, but
she's not really listening to me, so...

16:48.894 --> 16:51.929
All right, um,
I need to see Tyler.

16:51.997 --> 16:54.866
- Where is he?
- Iso. Just right through there.

17:01.139 --> 17:03.240
Liv? You were

17:03.307 --> 17:05.842
supposed to call me
if anything changed.

17:05.910 --> 17:07.676
I'm fine.

17:07.744 --> 17:11.047
Any luck finding out
where they caught it?

17:11.115 --> 17:13.949
We think Karl was hiding something.
I don't know if Tyler was involved,

17:14.017 --> 17:17.252
but he might know something.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.454
Go easy on him.

17:19.521 --> 17:21.423
OK.

17:21.491 --> 17:23.458
Tyler?

17:23.526 --> 17:25.828
- Tyler, can you hear me?
- Help... me.

17:25.896 --> 17:28.764
I'm gonna help you. I just need to know what
you did this afternoon. Where were you?

17:28.832 --> 17:32.033
Me and K-Karl...
celebrating.

17:32.101 --> 17:34.869
- What were you celebrating?
- Y-You gotta...

17:34.937 --> 17:36.805
get out of here.

17:58.793 --> 18:02.094
He and Karl were drinking
champagne at a bar with a girl.

18:02.162 --> 18:04.763
Toby, who knows how many
people are infected by now?

18:04.832 --> 18:06.765
At the speed this thing is
going, we could go

18:06.834 --> 18:09.601
from an outbreak
to a full-blown epidemic.

18:16.781 --> 18:19.149
There you go.
All right, good choice.

18:19.216 --> 18:22.753
Gentlemen, something
from the bar? No? OK.

18:22.820 --> 18:26.857
Good news: researchers at Dr. Marette's
company have isolated the virus.

18:26.924 --> 18:29.826
- It's related to the Marburg virus.
- No, I've had patients

18:29.894 --> 18:32.262
show symptoms
within the first six hours.

18:32.329 --> 18:34.229
The Marburg virus does not
infect that quickly,

18:34.297 --> 18:36.532
and it isn't an aerosol
transmission virus.

18:36.599 --> 18:38.768
I said it was related
to the Marburg virus.

18:38.835 --> 18:41.503
There are elements of pig DNA
that it's mutated with.

18:41.571 --> 18:43.505
Yes, but this still doesn't
explain this virus.

18:43.573 --> 18:46.642
The speed and means of infection
imply huge mutations.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.743
It would have shown up by now.

18:48.811 --> 18:51.880
Is there any chance this could
be human engineered? - Not likely.

18:51.947 --> 18:55.416
This is Dr. Marette's area
of expertise--her speciality.

18:55.484 --> 18:57.986
I think it's probably best
if we just let her do her job.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.088
[We're currently working
on an antiviral.]

19:00.156 --> 19:02.924
It could take a day or two, but we
hope to have something for you soon.

19:02.992 --> 19:05.358
That's not quick enough. I have
people failing by the minute.

19:05.426 --> 19:09.596
- We'll get back to you as soon as we can.
- Thank you. Thanks very much.

19:09.664 --> 19:11.131
Olivia,

19:11.199 --> 19:14.134
I understand the stress
you're under.

19:14.202 --> 19:16.804
I really do.

19:16.871 --> 19:18.806
Dr. Marette's the expert.

19:18.873 --> 19:21.974
We do what we do;
let her do what she does.

19:22.042 --> 19:24.210
- All right?
- OK.

19:37.556 --> 19:39.958
Hey, Dev, I need you
to find a bar for me.

19:40.026 --> 19:43.095
I got a read off Tyler Ross. I
saw him and Karl drinking there.

19:43.162 --> 19:45.097
There was a poster
for a band called Dopes.

19:45.164 --> 19:48.100
OK. I'll look them up. I'll
try to find out their schedule.

19:48.167 --> 19:52.303
Also, I saw Karl kissing a girl. Are there
any records indicating he has a girlfriend?

19:52.371 --> 19:54.538
No family, no girlfriend.

19:54.606 --> 19:56.941
But if she's out there,
chances are she's probably sick.

19:57.008 --> 19:58.809
<i>Give me a few minutes.</i>
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

19:58.877 --> 20:00.444
All right, thanks, man.

20:03.215 --> 20:05.783
He's leaving!
Why can he leave?

20:05.851 --> 20:09.318
What about my daughter?
(mumbling)

20:09.386 --> 20:11.687
Hey, take my daughter with you!

20:11.756 --> 20:14.557
- Calm down.
- No, I'm not going to calm down.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.826
Try to calm down. Please.
(woman sobbing)

20:16.894 --> 20:19.695
We're all going to die in here.

20:19.764 --> 20:21.965
(woman panting)

20:22.032 --> 20:24.367
You're trying
to kill my daughter.

20:24.434 --> 20:27.870
Kelly. Your name is Kelly, right? You
don't want your daughter leaving here.

20:27.937 --> 20:30.773
She's not sick now, but she
might be, and if she goes

20:30.840 --> 20:34.309
out there she could make
your whole family sick.

20:34.377 --> 20:36.779
She could infect her friends,

20:36.846 --> 20:40.515
her own family--
everyone she loves.

20:40.583 --> 20:42.984
And the worst part about it is

20:43.051 --> 20:45.552
if she's out there
on her own, sick...

20:47.589 --> 20:51.793
...there'll be no one
to take care of her.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.560
Her only shot is here.

20:56.731 --> 20:58.165
OK?

20:58.232 --> 21:00.167
Yeah.

21:00.234 --> 21:03.603
- OK.
- OK.

21:03.671 --> 21:06.072
- Hey, Toby. It's me.
<i>- Hey, what's up?</i>

21:06.140 --> 21:08.641
Dopes had one gig this week--
at the Silver Dollar on Spadina.

21:08.709 --> 21:11.011
<i>All right, Michelle and I
will go check that out.</i>

21:13.013 --> 21:15.080
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.783
- So, I just got off the phone with Dev.
- Good. So you're up to speed?

21:17.851 --> 21:19.885
- Yeah.
- All right.

21:29.228 --> 21:31.429
(man coughing)
Hello?

21:31.496 --> 21:34.265
(man coughing)

21:34.333 --> 21:37.668
I'll call it in.

21:37.736 --> 21:39.904
- Help me.
- All right. Help is on its way.

21:39.972 --> 21:44.742
But this is very important. Earlier
today, there was two men and one woman

21:44.810 --> 21:47.978
- drinking champagne here. Do you remember them?
- I don't remember.

21:48.046 --> 21:50.815
Think about it.
Who was the woman?

22:00.892 --> 22:04.527
We're gonna take care of you. You're
gonna be all right. Just breathe.

22:04.595 --> 22:07.464
<i>Dev, Toby saw Karl's</i>
<i>girlfriend buying champagne</i>

22:07.531 --> 22:10.933
at the Silver Dollar earlier today.
I need you to track it for us.

22:11.001 --> 22:13.302
<i>Give me a second to get</i>
<i>into the credit card system.</i>

22:13.371 --> 22:16.673
Uh, OK, Silver Dollar.
One o'clock.

22:16.741 --> 22:18.640
Only one purchase made

22:18.708 --> 22:21.176
by a woman at that time: $263

22:21.244 --> 22:23.311
by one Joanne Friese.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.280
<i>661 Howland Avenue.</i>

22:25.348 --> 22:28.016
OK, call Public Health.
Tell them we're on our way.

22:28.084 --> 22:31.920
<i>Will do. Oh, by the way, I've traced all the
reports of other infections in the city.</i>

22:31.988 --> 22:35.423
I've found that all of them seem to have either
a first or second connection to that bar.

22:35.491 --> 22:38.158
Meaning - Meaning Karl or Tyler
are probably the source

22:38.226 --> 22:40.127
- of the infection.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

22:40.195 --> 22:42.697
If Karl was at the first tier
of the infection,

22:42.765 --> 22:46.200
and Tyler was infected hours after that,
we can start to build a timeline.

22:46.268 --> 22:48.636
<i>The bartender was infected</i>
<i>nine hours ago.</i>

22:48.704 --> 22:51.605
All right, so Karl must have been
infected no more than 10 hours ago.

22:51.672 --> 22:54.841
Whatever he was doing at the time will
be the key to tracking the source.

22:54.909 --> 22:57.176
Let's hope his girlfriend's
the end of that trail.

22:57.244 --> 22:59.112
When is it ever that easy?

23:02.182 --> 23:05.584
(heart rate monitor beeping)

23:08.087 --> 23:09.622
(she sighs)

23:21.734 --> 23:24.168
It's not Halloween, you know.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.138
You can never be too early. You should
get back in your apartment there.

23:29.508 --> 23:32.043
This is way scarier
than Halloween.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.749
Jo!

23:44.188 --> 23:45.956
Jo?

23:55.666 --> 23:57.132
I'll call it in.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.201
Jo? Jo.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.548
Jo! Jo!

24:19.655 --> 24:22.124
Did you get anything?

24:22.192 --> 24:25.260
(he sighs)
They were here.

24:25.328 --> 24:27.328
There was a stuffed toy.

24:31.633 --> 24:33.701
This one here.

24:40.109 --> 24:41.642
Wait a minute.

24:45.546 --> 24:48.482
Hey, over here!

24:52.820 --> 24:55.288
Kelly.
(Kelly gasps weakly)

24:55.356 --> 24:58.857
I had them check on your
daughter, and she's doing fine.

25:01.561 --> 25:02.995
(she gasps)

25:03.063 --> 25:05.898
Her BP is through the roof.

25:05.965 --> 25:08.867
She's showing signs of jaundice. Her
living is failing. Give me 50 milligrams

25:08.935 --> 25:11.470
- of mannitol.
- Should we wait for the blood work?

25:11.538 --> 25:13.339
- No, there's no time.
<i>- Code Blue, room 305.</i>

25:13.407 --> 25:15.806
That's Tyler Ross. Go ahead.
I'm fine here.

25:15.874 --> 25:17.475
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

25:22.681 --> 25:24.682
Good, Kelly.

25:24.750 --> 25:27.885
That should stabilize
her liver. Monitor her BP,

25:27.953 --> 25:30.087
and measure
accurate urine output.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.656
It's gonna be OK.
(Kelly gasping)

25:32.723 --> 25:34.758
I'll be right back.

25:45.370 --> 25:48.637
We did everything we could.

25:50.607 --> 25:53.076
Secure the body.

26:11.025 --> 26:12.560
Olivia!

26:18.400 --> 26:20.401
All right, Dev,
what do you got for us?

26:20.469 --> 26:22.303
<i>I got some background</i>
<i>on Joanne Friese.</i>

26:22.370 --> 26:25.338
No record. She's been with Karl
Stiles for the past six months.

26:25.406 --> 26:28.475
I'm gonna dig a little deeper and
see what else I can find out.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.810
- Is there anything on the vial?
<i>- Public Health investigators</i>

26:30.877 --> 26:32.612
<i>checked it out.</i>
<i>It was the virus.</i>

26:32.679 --> 26:35.115
It seems a small amount leaked
around the seal.

26:35.182 --> 26:37.879
However they got it, it wasn't
properly packed for transport.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.185
What about the vial itself?

26:39.253 --> 26:42.254
It's a standard laboratory container.
No markings on the vial or the seal.

26:42.322 --> 26:45.124
- Who actually tries to make something like this?
<i>- That's where the information</i>

26:45.191 --> 26:47.058
<i>from his hard drive might</i>
<i>come in handy.</i>

26:47.127 --> 26:49.328
- You cracked the hard drive?
<i>- I'm still breaking it down,</i>

26:49.395 --> 26:52.631
but there are a few things in here that could
give us clues as to what they're up to.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.467
Here's a numbered account--
10 deposits made

26:55.535 --> 27:00.304
over the last six months, all by large
corporations and totalling over...

27:00.372 --> 27:03.641
<i>90,000. - Oh, there's no way</i>
<i>he earned that kind of money.</i>

27:03.708 --> 27:07.044
<i>All the companies who made deposits
are high-tech companies. I've got</i>

27:07.112 --> 27:10.581
inquiries into the ones I could identify,
but none of them are in biotech.

27:10.649 --> 27:13.250
Right, so we're back
at square one.

27:13.317 --> 27:16.286
Note quite. They didn't clear the history on
their messaging cache. I was able to retrieve

27:16.354 --> 27:19.523
a message that was sent a day before those
two boys showed up at the hospital.

27:19.590 --> 27:21.525
The message itself was,
uh, pretty vanilla.

27:21.592 --> 27:24.227
<i>Something about buying books</i>
<i>on carp fishing.</i>

27:24.295 --> 27:28.465
Yeah, I figured it was code, so I traced
back the owner of the account he emailed,

27:28.533 --> 27:32.000
and it turned out to be
Hiram Wright.

27:32.068 --> 27:34.136
He's done time
for both forgery and fraud.

27:34.204 --> 27:36.038
OK, so if they only
communicate by email,

27:36.105 --> 27:37.906
chances are he doesn't know
what happened to Karl.

27:37.974 --> 27:40.376
Yeah, I already sent him
an email using Karl's account.

27:53.189 --> 27:57.659
Mr. Wright? I need to ask you a
few questions about Karl Stiles.

28:08.436 --> 28:12.506
- You OK?
- Yeah. Why do they always run?

28:12.574 --> 28:14.075
Let's bring him in.

28:19.029 --> 28:21.530
So, what's your connection
to Karl Stiles?

28:21.597 --> 28:23.385
I don't know any Stiles.

28:23.505 --> 28:26.502
Don't lie to us.
You saw him yesterday.

28:26.569 --> 28:28.570
Like hell I did.

28:34.476 --> 28:36.778
You met him in a park.

28:36.846 --> 28:39.313
You gave him something.
What was it?

28:39.381 --> 28:41.583
I didn't give him anything.
I told you I don't know him.

28:45.721 --> 28:48.189
There is a way that you can
walk away from this.

28:48.257 --> 28:50.223
Lady, I'm walking anyway.

28:50.291 --> 28:53.326
Maybe we're doing this wrong.

28:53.394 --> 28:56.263
See, you screwed
with some dangerous people.

28:56.330 --> 29:00.935
We have no problem
telling them what you did.

29:01.002 --> 29:03.003
Think about that.

29:03.071 --> 29:04.871
<i>Ripped off the Russians--</i>
<i>they couldn't know.</i>

29:04.939 --> 29:07.273
<i>They believe me.</i>

29:07.340 --> 29:11.077
See, if you don't tell us
what we want to know,

29:11.144 --> 29:14.480
we're happy to tell the Russians
who ripped 'em off.

29:14.548 --> 29:16.583
You don't know anything.

29:16.650 --> 29:18.551
Well, yeah, they suspected you.

29:18.619 --> 29:20.953
They've just been waiting
for confirmation.

29:27.860 --> 29:30.062
Tell us what you know.

29:35.868 --> 29:38.135
I made some ID for Karl.

29:38.203 --> 29:41.405
They were security cards
used by Templar Security.

29:41.473 --> 29:43.874
Had mag strips and company
access codes built in.

29:43.942 --> 29:45.876
Where was he going to use them
to break into?

29:45.944 --> 29:48.512
- I don't-- - Don't lie to us! Come on!
- I'm telling you the truth!

29:48.580 --> 29:51.082
- Where were they going?
- I don't know!

29:51.149 --> 29:54.050
- Toby, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Better not be lying, man.

29:57.722 --> 29:59.288
I'm sorry.

30:01.225 --> 30:03.159
Look, we got what we needed.

30:03.227 --> 30:06.730
I know Olivia is sick,
but we have to keep it together.

30:06.797 --> 30:09.397
I know. I know.

30:09.465 --> 30:11.399
Let's go see what Dev has.

30:19.475 --> 30:21.476
You shouldn't be in here.

30:21.544 --> 30:23.779
Hey, look,
don't worry about us.

30:23.847 --> 30:25.813
Hennessey said that if we're not
sick already, we probably have

30:25.881 --> 30:27.915
a natural immunity.
How are you feeling?

30:27.983 --> 30:31.753
Like I got hit by a bus.

30:31.820 --> 30:34.789
Well, at least you didn't get hit by one
of those trucks that carry cars around.

30:34.857 --> 30:36.390
Right? That'd be much worse.

30:39.327 --> 30:41.328
I screwed it up.

30:41.396 --> 30:43.897
I should have been able
to do more.

30:48.936 --> 30:51.004
Just... just get
some rest, OK?

30:51.072 --> 30:53.106
They're working on a cure.

30:53.175 --> 30:56.109
And Toby's gonna get it here in time, OK?
He always comes through.

30:56.178 --> 30:59.179
(coughing) Five hundred
milligrams of Phenobarbital!

30:59.246 --> 31:03.650
Go get her some cold compresses. Go, quick!
Hey, Liv. Liv. Come on.

31:11.858 --> 31:14.393
Any luck checking out the
clients of Templar Security?

31:14.460 --> 31:17.629
I'm working my way through
the list. It's a big company--

31:17.697 --> 31:20.865
a couple hundred clients, and a lot of
them are high-tech and biomed companies.

31:20.933 --> 31:22.867
- Any of them report a break-in?
- No.

31:22.935 --> 31:24.869
But if your friend is right
and this is human engineered,

31:24.937 --> 31:26.838
I can't see anyone rushing
to admit that they let

31:26.906 --> 31:28.840
a killer virus they created
get out in the wild.

31:28.908 --> 31:31.141
OK, so we check them out
one by one.

31:31.210 --> 31:33.678
- Hey.
- Hey, it's me.

31:33.745 --> 31:35.680
I'm really gonna need
some good news here, Toby.

31:35.747 --> 31:37.682
<i>- Yeah, what's going on?</i>
<i>- It's bad, man.</i>

31:37.749 --> 31:41.352
Two more people have died.
Olivia's, uh... It's not good.

31:41.420 --> 31:43.321
All right, I'm coming in.

31:43.388 --> 31:45.988
Uh, anything comes up,
call me, OK?

31:48.326 --> 31:49.959
Let's start making a list.

32:00.571 --> 32:02.571
Give me 400mg Phenobarbital.

32:02.639 --> 32:05.641
- We've already given her 300.
- Then gee me 200 more!

32:15.852 --> 32:18.819
(she gasps)

32:21.823 --> 32:24.191
Liv?

32:27.429 --> 32:30.231
Liv. I'm here.

32:30.299 --> 32:32.267
Olivia.

32:32.334 --> 32:34.468
It's OK. It's OK.

32:34.535 --> 32:37.237
Just keep looking.

32:37.305 --> 32:39.205
(flat-line tone)
She's going into Vfib!

32:39.274 --> 32:41.441
OK, we're losing her.
Listen, you've got to step back,

32:41.509 --> 32:43.410
all right?
Paddles! Come on!

32:43.478 --> 32:45.845
All right, clear!

32:48.750 --> 32:50.949
(flat-line tone)

32:51.017 --> 32:53.486
♪

32:58.324 --> 33:00.092
Again! Clear!

33:00.160 --> 33:01.760
(defibrillator shock)

33:01.828 --> 33:03.195
Turn it up to 200.

33:03.263 --> 33:05.563
All clear.

33:09.468 --> 33:11.003
Again. Clear!

33:14.673 --> 33:16.841
(sounds muted)

34:13.241 --> 34:15.175
(cell phone ringing)

34:17.145 --> 34:19.045
(cell phone ringing)

34:21.364 --> 34:22.456
Hey.

34:22.748 --> 34:25.217
Hey, Toby, it's us.

34:26.253 --> 34:28.195
It isn't a good time, guys.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.036
[Michelle]: <i>We think we know</i>
<i>where the infection came from.</i>

34:30.156 --> 34:32.290
Yeah, I did a little more
digging into Karl's girlfriend, Jo.

34:32.358 --> 34:34.726
It turns out she did temp
work. Her last few assignments

34:34.793 --> 34:36.828
were high-tech companies,
and they were all companies

34:36.896 --> 34:39.764
- that paid out Karl. - She was the inside man.
She would get the information,

34:39.831 --> 34:41.867
then Karl would do the break-in
after she'd moved on.

34:41.934 --> 34:45.168
Which one of these were
biotech?

34:45.237 --> 34:47.905
There was only two:
Interplus Pharmaceuticals,

34:47.973 --> 34:49.907
and Forster BioMed.

34:49.975 --> 34:51.909
Well, Forster's the one
who stepped up

34:51.976 --> 34:54.143
- to create the anti-virus.
- When Karl and Jo moved

34:54.212 --> 34:57.114
their operation into the biotech
world, they hit the big league.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.115
A company like Forster would
happily pay out

34:59.183 --> 35:01.550
a couple hundred thousand
to save millions in research.

35:01.618 --> 35:04.487
Maybe to keep
what they were doing a secret.

35:04.554 --> 35:07.090
But why wouldn't they say
anything when it went missing?

35:07.157 --> 35:09.825
Well, it's illegal. I'm guessing no one
knows they were even developing it.

35:09.894 --> 35:12.328
And if it was Forster,
it makes sense for them to come

35:12.396 --> 35:14.997
forward with the antiviral
and come off as the heroes.

35:15.064 --> 35:18.967
Right, but don't do it so fast that it looks
like you created the virus in the first place.

35:19.035 --> 35:21.370
Let a few people die first.

35:21.437 --> 35:23.738
Dev's putting together the
warrant. I'm heading there now.

35:23.806 --> 35:25.908
Yeah, pick me up.
I'm gonna meet you outside.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.516
Toby, I am so sorry.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.919
I know how close
you and Olivia were.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.423
She was just helping people.

35:42.490 --> 35:46.260
Look, I promise you, whoever
is responsible is gonna pay.

35:56.170 --> 35:58.138
- Dr. Marette?
- Yes?

35:58.205 --> 36:00.941
- Sergeant McCluskey, IIB.
- Ah, I heard you were charged

36:01.008 --> 36:03.909
with finding the source of the
infection. I'm afraid I'm

36:03.977 --> 36:06.045
too busy right now looking
for the cure to help you.

36:06.112 --> 36:09.915
- We know that you've been manufacturing the virus.
- That's not true.

36:09.983 --> 36:13.485
Karl and his girlfriend were thieves.
Forster BioMed was their last target.

36:13.553 --> 36:16.355
Our company hasn't been compromised
in any way, and any suggestion

36:16.423 --> 36:18.623
to that effect will be met
with legal--

36:18.691 --> 36:22.860
- You let people die to cover your tracks.
There's proof of what you did, isn't there?

36:22.928 --> 36:25.063
I don't know what you're
talking about.<i>No way.</i>

36:25.130 --> 36:28.532
Project Quietude.
Destroy files.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.501
We know about Project Quietude.

36:30.569 --> 36:32.971
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

36:33.038 --> 36:35.005
Where are the files
that you want to destroy?

36:40.778 --> 36:43.580
They're in a safe.

36:43.647 --> 36:46.616
- Probably in her office.
- Go check out her office.

36:46.684 --> 36:49.052
No, excuse me,
you have no right!

36:49.120 --> 36:52.521
We have a warrant.
A bio team is on their way in.

36:52.589 --> 36:54.623
It would be best
if you cooperated.

36:59.429 --> 37:02.999
You had the anti-virus
the whole time, but you hid it.

37:03.066 --> 37:05.734
And a lot of innocent people
died because of that,

37:05.802 --> 37:08.971
and I hope they haunt you at
night, because you murdered them.

37:09.038 --> 37:12.207
We didn't have it ready. We stepped
up development after the theft.

37:12.274 --> 37:15.143
We were going to take it to the
hospital as soon as it was ready to go.

37:15.211 --> 37:19.014
I'm going to hand it to the
authorities when they arr--

37:21.150 --> 37:24.184
- Why'd you do it?
Tell me.

37:24.252 --> 37:26.487
It was research.

37:26.555 --> 37:28.623
Just research.
