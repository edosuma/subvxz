(CAL SINGING) Oh, the night
that Paddy Murphy died

02:34.946 --> 02:37.114
Is a night I'll never forget

02:37.407 --> 02:39.283
Some of the boys
got loaded drunk

02:39.367 --> 02:41.660
And they ain't got sober yet

02:41.744 --> 02:44.204
As long as
a bottle was passed around

02:44.289 --> 02:46.165
Every man was feeling gay

02:46.249 --> 02:48.500
O'Leary came
with the bagpipes

02:48.585 --> 02:50.085
Some music for to play

02:50.170 --> 02:53.672
That's how they
showed their respect
for Paddy Murphy

02:53.756 --> 02:56.758
That's how they showed
their honor and their pride

02:56.843 --> 02:58.427
They said it was
a sin and shame

02:58.595 --> 03:00.179
And they winked
at one another

03:00.263 --> 03:02.014
And every drink in
the place was full

03:02.098 --> 03:04.474
The night Pat Murphy died

03:09.647 --> 03:11.565
As Mrs. Murphy sat
in the corner

03:11.649 --> 03:13.275
Pouring out her grief

03:13.359 --> 03:16.361
Kelly and his gang came
tearing down the street

03:16.446 --> 03:18.197
They went into an empty room

03:18.281 --> 03:19.865
And a bottle of whiskey stole

03:19.949 --> 03:21.867
They put the bottle
with the corpse

03:21.951 --> 03:23.535
To keep that whiskey cold

03:23.620 --> 03:25.996
That's how they showed
their respect for...

03:27.457 --> 03:28.999
They took the white
kid to the hospital.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.709
He's in a coma.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.463
Officer, you should
check in with the family.

03:38.134 --> 03:41.178
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.304
Okay, guys, take off.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.555
Yes, sir.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.850
Coffee's free for
friends of the press.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.731
I heard Metro ballistics
was just here.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.441
Who told you that?

03:54.567 --> 03:56.193
You just did.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.195
You got the names of
the victims for me?

03:58.321 --> 03:59.821
You gotta be kidding me.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.573
You know I'm gonna
find out anyway.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.408
Not from me.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.662
Okay. You want to play
a little confirm or deny?

04:07.288 --> 04:10.082
I'm not playing this
game with you, Cal.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.501
Look, Don, I got
a living to make,
all right?

04:12.669 --> 04:15.003
I got mouths to feed,
goldfish.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.088
(CHUCKLING)

04:16.172 --> 04:18.423
No names,
no quotes,
all right?

04:20.301 --> 04:21.510
Okay.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.303
Two victims,
one shooter?

04:23.429 --> 04:24.596
Confirm.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.431
One dead,
one in the hospital?

04:26.557 --> 04:28.308
Confirm.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.851
Drug related?

04:29.936 --> 04:31.561
Confirm,
but deny later
if I have to.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.928
Good morning.
WOMAN: Good morning, sir.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.347
Okay, I'm late. I know.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.848
I don't need to
be reminded of it.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.892
I've been over
the briefing notes
1,000 times.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.518
Stephen.
Yes?

05:53.603 --> 05:55.062
Metro Police just called.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.646
What?

05:57.940 --> 06:02.110
Sonia Baker was
killed in an accident
on the Metro this morning.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.114
They identified her
by her staff badge.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.619
Horrible news
for all of us.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.789
But, Stephen,
we're scheduled
to start now.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.957
What do you want to do?

06:35.603 --> 06:36.645
WOMAN: Morning, Pittsburgh.

06:36.771 --> 06:37.813
Yinzer.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.733
Cal.
Morning.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.360
Talk to me
about this shooting.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.778
You know,
one guy's still alive.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.238
Deshaun Stagg?

06:46.322 --> 06:47.823
No, he's dead.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.491
The other guy on the bike,
Vernon Sando.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.493
Hey, Gene, did you read
the guinea pig piece I filed?

06:51.577 --> 06:52.619
Yeah, I'll get
to it, Ferris.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.746
Because it's a great
human interest story.
Yeah, human interest.

06:54.831 --> 06:55.914
So what's the deal?

06:55.998 --> 06:58.959
Stagg's drug deal goes wrong,
and this guy just rides by?

06:59.043 --> 07:00.460
Yeah, something like that,
I think.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.795
That's a remarkable
feat of survival.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.214
Well, at least it's
got a little bit of
a zip code to it.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.590
Georgetown's the angle,
right?

07:05.675 --> 07:08.468
No, no, the angle is
that this guy Vernon Sando

07:08.553 --> 07:09.928
has got an MBA from Duke.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.138
What's he doing on a bike?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.389
He's buying
a pizza franchise.

07:12.473 --> 07:13.932
You know,
they make you ride the bike

07:14.016 --> 07:15.392
for the first six months,
learn the ropes.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.894
He's got a wife,
two kids, mortgage,
total citizen.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.312
What's his condition?

07:19.397 --> 07:21.940
Critical, non-reactive.
Paragraph three.
He's in a coma.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.609
Okay, let me know.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.278
I will.

Welcome to our hearings
with private security
contractor PointCorp,

07:36.622 --> 07:38.832
part of the inquiry
into the Defense Department's

07:38.916 --> 07:41.710
privatization and
outsourcing practices.

07:41.794 --> 07:46.548
Before we begin,
I've just received
some terrible news.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.760
Sonia Baker,

07:50.845 --> 07:54.973
who was the lead researcher
for this committee

07:55.057 --> 08:00.228
and a valued
member of my staff,
died this morning.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.396
(CROWD MURMURING)

08:02.398 --> 08:05.984
The circumstances
of her death
are not yet clear.

08:13.493 --> 08:17.746
Well, I'd like to
send my condolences
to her family.

he's balling her.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.473
50 bucks?
Wait, you owe me 50 bucks.

GENE: Somebody get me
a picture of the girl.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.940
Let's hope she's not
5'2" and 300 pounds.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.026
Gene, Gene, what is your
obsession with fat girls?

08:48.110 --> 08:49.736
If you want to
have sex with Pete,
you should just say it.

Not tonight,
I got a headache.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.280
HANK: Say it.
Say it, Gene.
Say it.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.615
GENE: Picture! Picture!

08:53.699 --> 08:56.117
REPORTER: Reaction to
the tragic death was
initially,

08:56.285 --> 08:58.703
and understandably,
one of shock,

08:58.788 --> 09:01.456
yet questions immediately
began to surface

09:01.541 --> 09:03.625
as soon as Ms. Baker's death
was announced.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.096
Hey, Joe, Cal
McAffrey over
at the Globe.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.224
Just calling
about that shooting
in Georgetown last night.

09:19.308 --> 09:22.811
I heard the dead kid
had a couple of priors
as a purse snatcher.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.147
Got any more details for me?

09:29.610 --> 09:33.029
Call me back?
Yeah, yeah. You, too.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.491
Hey, I got
a question for you.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.159
Stephen Collins.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.869
He's an old friend of yours,
is that right?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.080
Yeah.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.374
I'm Della. Della Frye.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.710
I write
the Capitol Hill blog.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.920
All right.
Online side.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.006
I'm a big fan of your work.

09:52.550 --> 09:57.012
So, I'm writing this piece
on personal relationships

09:57.096 --> 09:58.597
in the political sphere,

09:58.681 --> 10:01.266
"single girl in
the corridors of power"
kind of thing,

10:01.350 --> 10:03.101
and as you probably know,

10:03.185 --> 10:05.061
there was this
incident this morning
on the Hill,

10:05.146 --> 10:06.146
at your friend's hearing.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.565
Is there a question
on the horizon?

10:11.068 --> 10:13.528
Yeah. Have you spoken
to him today?

10:14.322 --> 10:16.948
Are you trying to make me
part of your story?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.909
No. I'm trying to get
a little context.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.911
Context, re: Dirt?

10:23.956 --> 10:26.958
Well, do you think
he was having
an affair with that girl?

10:27.543 --> 10:29.502
Gee, Della.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.087
Yeah.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.132
I don't know.
I'd have to read
a couple of blogs

10:34.216 --> 10:36.176
before I could
form an opinion.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.054
Okay. Thanks for your help.

ANCHORWOMAN 1: Capitol Hill
may be rocked with
another bombshell.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.482
Speculation is rife
that Stephen Collins

10:50.566 --> 10:51.775
may have been
romantically linked

10:51.859 --> 10:54.235
with the young
aide found dead
this morning.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.655
His spokesmen call this
another political cloud...

10:56.739 --> 10:59.157
ANCHORMAN: The timing couldn't
be worse for Collins.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.035
He needs all the political
leverage he can get

11:02.119 --> 11:05.080
as he begins looking
into the Defense Department's

11:05.164 --> 11:06.665
outsourcing practices.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.834
ANCHORWOMAN 2: Called
mercenaries by some and
saviors by others,

11:09.919 --> 11:13.338
PointCorp, the controversial
private military contractor,

11:13.422 --> 11:15.256
is said to be
the biggest beneficiary

11:15.341 --> 11:19.135
in the Defense
Department's outsourcing
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.430
Collins, who'd been
married for 10 years
to his college sweetheart,

11:22.515 --> 11:25.767
is thought to have
refused to leave his wife
for Miss Baker.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.948
GEORGE: Brass tacks.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.201
Were you having
a relationship
with this girl?

11:46.622 --> 11:47.706
Yes,

11:48.332 --> 11:51.668
and I can't tell
you how sorry I am
about all of this.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.795
Okay.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.381
I've asked Andrew
here to help us

11:56.465 --> 11:58.675
handle things from
a media point of view.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.429
If anyone can steer us
through this, he can.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.390
Well, the next 72 hours
are gonna be brutal.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.267
You ought to brace
yourself for that.

12:07.351 --> 12:11.062
For a while,
you're gonna be everything
that's wrong with politics.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.273
You're still a star, Steve.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.692
The party takes
care of its stars.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.944
You just have to
lay low for a while.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.446
How low?

12:19.530 --> 12:20.655
Low.

12:22.199 --> 12:25.952
Nothing that would
bring any undue
attention to yourself.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.122
At the hearings,
for instance.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.333
We're not finished
with PointCorp.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.210
No, but you are.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.923
If you open up fire on
those guys right now,

12:39.008 --> 12:40.925
that's not gonna look
like good governance,

12:41.010 --> 12:43.678
just a calculated
distraction.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.266
Is your wife
speaking to you?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.894
No, not right now.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.439
Then that's job one,
isn't it?

12:59.528 --> 13:03.156
Yinzer! She knows you
got the message,

13:03.282 --> 13:05.158
and she knows
you're in the building.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.244
Yes.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.589
Morning.

13:19.673 --> 13:22.383
So, where are we?
Was he knobbing her or not?

13:23.552 --> 13:24.552
Morning, Cam.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.388
It's funny about you.
Every time your friend
runs for reelection

13:27.473 --> 13:28.681
or conducts a hearing,

13:28.766 --> 13:31.267
you drop his name to me
until we give
him some coverage.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.061
But he finally
does something

13:33.229 --> 13:34.938
that actually might
sell some newspapers,

13:35.022 --> 13:36.439
you're rendered mute.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.941
It's incongruous.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.150
No, it is not.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.152
It's inconsistent.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.904
(SCOFFS)
Don't be an ass.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.076
What do you think?

13:48.202 --> 13:49.911
Those are the ideas
for our facelift.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.499
I know. I know.
It's crap.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.502
Our new owners
have this odd idea

13:57.628 --> 13:59.337
that we ought to
be turning a profit.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.423
Yeah, well,
I hear our online
side is doing great.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.758
I mean,
not like I'm the kind of guy

14:03.926 --> 14:05.176
who would notice
that sort of thing,

14:05.261 --> 14:08.263
but I've been here,
what, 15 years?

14:08.347 --> 14:10.723
I use a 16-year-old computer.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.058
She's been here 15 minutes,

14:12.142 --> 14:14.686
and she could launch
a Russian satellite
with the gear she's got.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.980
Yeah, she told me
you behaved like a pig.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.273
That's too strong.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.691
Well, piggish.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.485
I showed her
a little snout.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.699
Well, I happen to like

Me who? Bitch, you the one
got your number blocked!

27:23.642 --> 27:26.935
Don't be fronting me, man.
It's Deshaun. Come on.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.103
No.
Where you at?

27:28.188 --> 27:30.105
Who the hell gave
you my number, fool?

27:30.190 --> 27:31.690
I was just talking to Kippy.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.400
Skippy?
Kippy, man.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.610
This shit ain't funny, trick.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.830
Hi. You've reached
Sonia Baker.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.248
I can't take
your call right now,

27:48.333 --> 27:49.708
but if you leave
your name, number,

27:49.793 --> 27:53.003
and the time you called,
I'll be sure to get
back to you. Thanks.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.350
Hi. You've reached
Sonia Baker.

28:06.434 --> 28:07.810
I can't take
your call right now,

28:07.936 --> 28:09.353
but if you leave
your name, number,

28:09.437 --> 28:12.523
and the time you called,
I'll be sure to get
back to you. Thanks.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.698
Excuse me.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.327
Sonia Baker.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.913
We got any kind of
drug angle on her?

28:27.997 --> 28:30.374
She ever arrested or rehabbed
or anything like that?

28:30.458 --> 28:32.292
Who's asking?
Me.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.795
You're not on the story.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.797
I gave you
the Metro tapes idea, right?

28:37.298 --> 28:38.674
Yeah.

28:39.634 --> 28:43.137
So are you trying to ruin
what's left of
her reputation?

28:44.097 --> 28:46.056
Are you doing
this for Collins?

28:46.182 --> 28:48.142
A little context on Sonia?

28:50.270 --> 28:52.187
You gotta be kidding.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.908
Hey, Maurice.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.369
Hey, Cal,
you getting your regular?

29:07.454 --> 29:08.412
Yeah.

29:08.496 --> 29:09.872
Sure. Hey, Jay!

29:10.373 --> 29:15.294
I need a chili cheeseburger,
a chili cheese fry,
and a chili half-smoke.

29:15.378 --> 29:17.212
I got the burger on!

29:18.715 --> 29:20.507
Anybody get you yet?

29:29.225 --> 29:30.934
All right.
You're a hungry man, eh?

29:31.019 --> 29:32.019
Yeah.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.645
How's it going, Happy?

29:55.502 --> 29:58.295
That's a long way to
go for another soda.

30:00.673 --> 30:04.593
You want to buy something
from the last bag
Deshaun ever stole?

30:05.094 --> 30:06.553
I need 500 bucks.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.240
Did you get the train okay?

30:26.366 --> 30:27.491
What?

30:27.575 --> 30:29.660
Did you get on
the train all right?

30:29.786 --> 30:31.870
Get through.
Everything okay?

30:33.248 --> 30:35.582
You're gonna
make small talk?

30:40.421 --> 30:43.090
(CLEARING THROAT) I will go
check on the arrangements.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.985
I'm sorry.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.536
It doesn't have to be
a detailed statement.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.581
Short and dignified,
and we'll be out of here.

31:15.665 --> 31:18.417
Dignified. Got it.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.927
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for
joining us here today.

31:29.012 --> 31:32.180
Mr. And Mrs. Collins
would like to give you
a brief statement.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.659
GIRL: Deshaun boosted
this metal briefcase

31:52.785 --> 31:55.495
from some guy
outside of Starbucks.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.582
That's what we did,
you know?

31:59.959 --> 32:03.337
Grab a guy's bag and
sell it back to him.

32:08.217 --> 32:12.220
Usually we just got,
like, people's business
papers and shit.

32:13.181 --> 32:16.099
This one?
This one was different.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.216
GIRL: There was a gun
in there, too,

32:49.801 --> 32:53.261
and a little bag of these
weird-looking bullets.

32:54.722 --> 32:56.139
Did you see the guy
that owned the bag?

32:56.265 --> 32:57.683
No.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.814
I told Deshaun
we shouldn't
sell this bag back.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.149
I mean, you know,
what about the girl?

33:06.234 --> 33:09.569
But he needed
a fix real bad,

33:09.654 --> 33:14.199
and he and this
guy figured out
a time and place.

33:14.283 --> 33:16.076
And that was it.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.289
My boy never came back.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.626
You took these out of
the briefcase first,

33:25.253 --> 33:27.504
and then you called her
from Deshaun's phone.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.589
Her number was there, too.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.134
I figured someone
had to warn her

33:32.218 --> 33:34.469
that this psycho was
following her around.

33:36.055 --> 33:37.973
She just didn't pick up.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.101
Mr. Collins moved to
staunch a growing tide

33:41.269 --> 33:43.645
of hostility towards him
this afternoon

33:43.730 --> 33:45.147
when he appeared
together with his...

33:45.231 --> 33:46.732
...the long line of
politicians' wives.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.526
We've had triumphs
and disappointments,

33:49.610 --> 33:52.029
and we've both made mistakes
that have caused...

33:52.113 --> 33:56.867
MAN: Apologize for
his affair and offer an
apology to his constituents.

33:56.951 --> 33:58.326
Can you believe this?

33:58.411 --> 34:00.162
We're on six channels
simultaneously.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.040
CAL: Who might have
wanted Sonia dead?

34:04.083 --> 34:05.792
What?
Is there something
in her history,

34:05.877 --> 34:07.044
you know, something you
haven't told me about?

34:07.128 --> 34:10.047
Some connections
that might have
got her in trouble?

34:10.131 --> 34:13.884
No. No, no. Wait, who...

34:13.968 --> 34:14.968
Am I talking to
my friend now,

34:15.136 --> 34:16.136
or am I talking
to a reporter?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.474
I gotta be both.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.934
You ever heard of a guy
called Deshaun Stagg?

34:23.019 --> 34:24.019
No.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.687
Was a kid. Minor criminal.

34:25.772 --> 34:29.483
Drug addict.
Got shot and killed
the night before Sonia died.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.818
Cal,
Sonia didn't have anything
to do with drugs.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.780
Look, Stephen,
I'm telling you things

34:34.864 --> 34:36.865
that I haven't even
discussed with the paper.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.909
Okay, you gotta
think about this.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.994
Who might have
wanted Sonia dead?

34:57.470 --> 35:01.348
CHRIS: Who is this man here
in all the photographs
where she's crying?

35:01.432 --> 35:03.308
CAL: We don't know that yet.

35:04.644 --> 35:08.271
And what was her background
before she started
working with Collins?

35:09.357 --> 35:11.358
DELLA: Well, she has some
very random moments
in her résumé.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.819
She was...
She waitressed
a couple times.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.904
She had
a string of bad debts.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.073
Shoplifting conviction
two years ago.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.117
Don't they do
background checks
on the Hill?

35:20.201 --> 35:22.202
DELLA: She wrote position
papers for Collins

35:22.328 --> 35:24.329
about bank regulations
and the SEC.

35:24.413 --> 35:26.331
I mean,
a lot of people thought
she was a star.

35:26.415 --> 35:30.377
She was also
the lead researcher
on the PointCorp hearings.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.295
CAMERON: So?

35:34.215 --> 35:38.051
Stephen represents
the loss of a lot of
money for those guys.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.140
Look, what if all of
this is just an attempt

35:43.224 --> 35:45.016
to marginalize
Stephen Collins?

35:46.644 --> 35:48.436
CAMERON: You've gotta love him
for it, haven't you?

35:48.521 --> 35:51.731
I mean,
you give him 24 hours,
body in the alley,

35:51.816 --> 35:53.483
and this geezer
will turn it into

35:53.609 --> 35:55.277
a full-blown
corporate conspiracy.

35:55.361 --> 35:56.486
You don't see
any connection?

35:56.612 --> 35:57.779
No.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.490
All right.
Let's go through
what we know, okay?

36:00.575 --> 36:03.368
The guy that was
stalking Sonia Baker,

36:03.494 --> 36:06.288
he shot Deshaun Stagg
and Vernon Sando.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.626
Deshaun Stagg,
of no fixed abode,
he boosts a briefcase.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.337
Now, in that briefcase
are these photographs,

36:14.422 --> 36:18.425
and according to our source,
a little baggie
of weird bullets.

36:19.635 --> 36:20.969
Metro PD ballistics tell me

36:21.053 --> 36:24.806
the casings at
the crime scene were reloads,
untraceable.

36:25.683 --> 36:29.978
The slugs were hand cast
at twice the weight of
store-bought bullets,

36:30.813 --> 36:32.314
X'ed for expansion.

36:32.398 --> 36:35.442
So that means
that the shooter
intended to kill.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.945
Stagg and Sando were
both double-tapped,

36:39.030 --> 36:41.656
one bullet in the spine,
one in the head.
That is the mark of a pro,

36:41.741 --> 36:44.743
or at the very least,
somebody with
a military background,

36:44.827 --> 36:46.828
perhaps even Special Forces.

36:47.371 --> 36:53.376
PointCorp founded by,
staffed by 100% ex-military.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.632
I think that's
a connection
we can't ignore.

37:02.511 --> 37:05.347
Chris, how long before
we have to hand these over?

37:06.474 --> 37:08.934
CHRIS: Time to verify,
consult relevant case files,

37:09.060 --> 37:11.478
outside counsel,
48 hours, tops.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.733
But if this is evidence,
don't they need
to see it now?

37:27.495 --> 37:28.995
How's he doing?

37:47.932 --> 37:49.766
Hey, you gonna let me know
if I gotta call
the ID team, right?

37:49.850 --> 37:51.184
NURSE: I'll let you know.

37:56.065 --> 37:59.901
Walter Schroyer,
Army buddy of your
libidinous friend,

37:59.986 --> 38:02.237
gives his moving tribute
to Stephen Collins

38:02.321 --> 38:05.323
in that asswipe
excuse of a paper
and not to us. Why?

38:05.783 --> 38:08.702
CAL: Platitudes,
padding and fluff.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.329
I'm a journalist.
I'm not a publicist.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.747
CAMERON: I want to bring
some more people in

38:12.873 --> 38:14.207
to work with
you on this, Cal,

38:14.292 --> 38:17.252
on the political side,
people with real experience.

38:17.336 --> 38:18.712
I'm thinking Ted Moody.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.171
I mean,
Ted's perfect for this.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.799
Are you taking me
off the story?

38:22.883 --> 38:25.844
No, no.
Not off, just off point.

38:25.928 --> 38:28.179
If this is as big as he
says it is, a big "if,"

38:28.306 --> 38:30.557
then it's gonna
be good for you.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.600
How? How is that good?

38:32.685 --> 38:34.394
Well, watching
seasoned reporters

38:34.520 --> 38:36.187
that work on
a big story, you know,

38:36.272 --> 38:37.897
being a part of it all,
you'll learn a lot.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.691
So, Ted Moody,
what do you think?

38:39.775 --> 38:40.900
Don't let her do it.

38:40.985 --> 38:44.404
And, Cal, if you're on this,
I want this to be
clean through and through.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.448
Tell her to forget it.
It's your gig.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.575
You got it. Get loud now.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.660
Excuse me.
You're defending her now?

38:50.745 --> 38:53.038
She's fine.
I can work with her.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.623
But, Cal,
she's inexperienced.

38:55.708 --> 38:56.833
Inexperience isn't fatal.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.044
I'm not giving up the story!

39:00.629 --> 39:03.173
I just... Sorry. I just...

39:03.257 --> 39:06.343
If I could just have
a few more days with it,

39:06.427 --> 39:09.220
I promise you I'm not
gonna let you down.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.725
For Christ's sake.

39:15.102 --> 39:17.395
Don't throw those
dewy cub reporter
eyes at me.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.605
It's nauseating.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.443
And fuck you very much.

39:23.611 --> 39:24.736
Pleasure.

39:26.947 --> 39:28.823
This is Nurse
Leif and myself...
The lab work's back.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.367
It's the panel 13 you ordered?

39:30.451 --> 39:32.952
Yeah, well, we called for
a neurologist a half hour ago.

39:33.287 --> 39:35.580
You can't use
that phone here, sir.

39:35.664 --> 39:38.041
Hey. What's up, Carnes?
How you doing?

39:38.793 --> 39:39.834
Yeah. Yeah.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.044
Looks like that
Sando guy's waking up.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.796
You sending anyone over?

39:49.428 --> 39:50.428
You ever been
to D.C. Hospital?

39:50.554 --> 39:51.554
No.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.390
Don't worry about it.
It's easy.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.559
CAL: All right,
there's a uniformed officer
on the third floor ICU.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.478
Okay.
Write it down. Got a pen?

39:58.562 --> 39:59.604
Yes.
Here.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.106
I have a pen.
Okay.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.858
The uniformed officer's
name is Brown.

40:03.984 --> 40:04.984
Okay.
Brown.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.405
Third floor ICU.
Tell him that
Detective Bynes,

40:08.489 --> 40:09.656
B-Y-N-E-S, Joe Bynes...

40:09.824 --> 40:10.949
Okay.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.659
All right,
he cleared you for access.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.411
Access for what?

40:15.287 --> 40:18.581
Vernon Sando, the pizza guy,
looks like he's coming around.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.375
That's your side
of the story.

40:20.459 --> 40:21.751
Excuse me?

40:21.877 --> 40:23.169
You heard me.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.756
You want me to go
and sit around
in some hospital,

40:26.841 --> 40:30.427
waiting for a guy
who looks like he might be
coming out of a coma,

40:30.511 --> 40:33.179
while you clean up
the rest of the story?

40:33.722 --> 40:36.599
I mean, is that what
that was all about in there?

40:36.684 --> 40:40.437
Look, this is a real story.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.272
It's not open
for interpretation.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.190
It does not require opinion.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.360
We got two dead bodies,
and we got a guy in a coma,

40:48.195 --> 40:49.946
and we got us with a lead
that nobody else has got.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.156
So you gotta make
a decision,

40:51.240 --> 40:52.907
because I have to follow
another lead tonight,

40:52.992 --> 40:55.702
and I cannot be in
two places at one time.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.288
So, are you gonna
be okay slumming it

40:58.372 --> 41:00.540
to find out if Vernon Sando's
coming around or not?

41:03.836 --> 41:05.003
Good.

we gotta work together.

Is he coming around?

Yeah, yeah,
it looks that way.

a detective over

Yeah, Officer Brown.

No, sir.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.241
You okay?

43:00.327 --> 43:03.037
My dad did warn me
about politicians.

43:03.998 --> 43:08.001
The only people
he hated more was
journalists.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.796

I'm making you nervous.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.678
You always did.

Well, they say
sex is the best way
to ruin a friendship.

They do, do they?
And who's they?

No. We should have given
the police that file.

were fingerprints
on the photographs?

and we've kept it
for less than a day.

we didn't actually
know what we had here.

what you had.

that your need was
greater than ours,

47:16.124 --> 47:17.917
The thesis that
we are pursuing

47:18.001 --> 47:22.505
involves a certain company
that Congressman
Collins is investigating.

47:22.589 --> 47:24.590
DONALD: What, this is
corporate conspiracies

47:24.716 --> 47:26.676

the highest levels?

47:26.760 --> 47:30.012
All my years on the job,
I've only ever seen that
on TV.

47:30.097 --> 47:33.391
All the years I've known you,
you've only ever
watched sports on TV.

47:33.475 --> 47:37.562
CAMERON: So, Detective,
in exchange for
our cooperation,

47:37.646 --> 47:40.273
can we be assured
that you will open
your books to us?

47:40.357 --> 47:42.441
Quid pro quo?

47:46.572 --> 47:48.823
If we decide to go
public with this,
we'll give you six hours,

47:48.907 --> 47:50.032
but that's the end of it.

47:50.117 --> 47:51.868
This is an open
homicide investigation.

47:51.952 --> 47:53.619
You slow us down,
endanger the public

47:53.787 --> 47:55.454
any more than
you already have,

47:55.539 --> 47:56.747
it won't be pretty.

47:56.832 --> 47:58.207
For the record,
I'm still not happy

47:58.292 --> 47:59.667
the way you presented
the evidence.

47:59.751 --> 48:02.461
I'm just gonna
put that out there.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.550
CAMERON: Police gossip
being what it is,

48:07.634 --> 48:09.510
I'm guessing that even
Entertainment Tonight

48:09.595 --> 48:12.388
will know as much as we do
within 48 hours.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.682
So we've gotta have
something solid today.

48:14.766 --> 48:17.268
That means no assumptions,
no unnamed sources.

48:17.352 --> 48:20.146
Not fast and loose.
I want this thing wrung out.

do a better job of it
than those cops.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.072
I'm good.

Well, you take
Sonia Baker, okay?

48:34.453 --> 48:36.245
I want to know everything
that we can about her,

48:36.330 --> 48:39.081
who she knew, who she blew,
the color of her knickers.

48:39.166 --> 48:41.000
Got it.
PointCorp?

48:41.668 --> 48:43.002
Okay. Hank and Pete,
you work with Cal.

48:43.170 --> 48:44.503
Cool.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.130
The rule on this
one is discretion.

48:46.214 --> 48:50.509
This is not a good
subject for gossip over
drinks at the Monocle,

48:50.594 --> 48:54.096
or spliffs in
the stationery
cupboard, you.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.389
I'm offended, truly.

get your stuff,
bring it in here,

because this is
your new home.

49:00.854 --> 49:02.688
Go on!

49:02.856 --> 49:04.690
Okay! Yes, yes, yes.
Speed of light.

49:12.157 --> 49:15.493
Cal? Any conflict
of interest here?

49:17.829 --> 49:18.996
No.

49:21.291 --> 49:22.917
SLATOFF: Perhaps this is
a good opportunity

49:23.001 --> 49:24.794
to address another issue
that's been discussed

49:24.878 --> 49:28.130
during these hearings,
your price structure.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.549
Surely,
and I thank you
for giving me

49:30.676 --> 49:33.052
an opportunity to
touch on that today.

49:33.679 --> 49:36.222
Our price structure follows
the Defense Department model

49:36.306 --> 49:38.766
as established in
the first Gulf War,

49:38.892 --> 49:41.352
adjusted, of course,
for inflation.

49:41.436 --> 49:44.855
Happily,
what's costing us so much
this time around

49:44.940 --> 49:48.693
are some incredible advances
in on-field medical care.

49:49.111 --> 49:50.778
But, simply,
we're now keeping more...

49:50.862 --> 49:52.989
Sir, I'm sorry. Just...

49:53.073 --> 49:55.324
When you were in the military,
did you see any combat duty?

49:55.409 --> 49:56.909
No, sir, I did not.
No.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.953
Do you think if you had,
you might see
things differently?

49:59.037 --> 50:00.830
MAN: We're all aware
of your war record,
Congressman.

50:00.914 --> 50:02.331
STEPHEN: I'm not talking
about my record.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.918
I'm talking about the numerous
allegations of atrocities

50:06.003 --> 50:09.088
committed by PointCorp
and its subsidiary
contractors

50:09.172 --> 50:11.757
against
the civilian population
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

50:11.842 --> 50:14.885
MAN: Those are
unsubstantiated allegations.

50:14.970 --> 50:17.430
Okay.
This is straightforward.

50:17.639 --> 50:21.017
Since a war on
terror was declared,

50:21.101 --> 50:25.271
has your personal
net worth gone up
by more than $250 million?

50:30.944 --> 50:32.903
Straightforward question.

50:32.988 --> 50:36.032
Excuse me,
I was told that
personal financial data

50:36.116 --> 50:39.035
would not be addressed
in open session.

50:39.119 --> 50:40.453
Adapt.

50:42.956 --> 50:44.623
Isn't that your slogan?

50:44.791 --> 50:46.459
"Adapt and Achieve?"

50:47.544 --> 50:50.004
It's on the brochure here.

50:50.839 --> 50:53.799
"Commoda et Confice."
You have it in Latin.

50:54.301 --> 50:55.551
MAN: Your point being?

50:55.635 --> 50:57.803
Putting war in
the hands of mercenaries

50:57.929 --> 51:00.056
and those who
consider it a business

51:00.140 --> 51:02.391
is a contradiction in
terms in any language.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.810
May I remind you,
sir, that the wars

51:04.978 --> 51:07.354
this country fought,
that defined it,

51:07.439 --> 51:10.399
were fought
despite what they cost,
not because of it.

51:10.484 --> 51:13.235
I didn't come here for
a lesson in morality,
Congressman.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.696
No, I expect you didn't.

51:15.781 --> 51:17.907
Well, especially from you.

51:18.366 --> 51:19.867
The men who work
for PointCorp,

51:19.951 --> 51:22.036
the men you dishonor by
calling them mercenaries

51:22.120 --> 51:26.999
are, by and large,
retired American
military personnel.

51:29.127 --> 51:31.295
It's a great system,
isn't it?

51:31.379 --> 51:35.341
We pay to train these men,
and you get rich
by killing them.

into PointCorp.

53:07.559 --> 53:09.393
I need somebody
on the inside,

53:09.519 --> 53:11.395
somebody who knows
the way they operate.

53:14.691 --> 53:17.484
WOMAN: She owed
everybody money.

53:17.569 --> 53:19.904
Oh, God,
that's how she always
walked around,

53:19.988 --> 53:21.864
in her underwear.

53:22.782 --> 53:24.325
Yeah!
You moved.
You can't move.

53:24.409 --> 53:25.409
Hi! Hi, yes, yes.

53:25.493 --> 53:27.995
Who is this?
He looks familiar.

53:28.121 --> 53:30.664
WOMAN: Dominic Foy.
He's a friend of Sonia's.

53:30.749 --> 53:32.082
Dominic.

53:32.292 --> 53:34.752
Hey, Michael, it's Cal.
So what did you find out?

53:35.462 --> 53:36.462
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

53:38.048 --> 53:40.216
DELLA: Hi. Mr. Statler?
STATLER: Yes?

53:40.300 --> 53:41.550
Yes, I'm from the Globe.

53:41.635 --> 53:43.844
I'm writing
an article on the death
of Sonia Baker,

53:43.929 --> 53:45.471
and I just wanted to...

53:46.014 --> 53:47.723
And he was, like,
high up in PointCorp?

53:48.516 --> 53:51.310
Hi. Della Frye from
the Washington Globe.

53:51.770 --> 53:53.896
I... Could I speak to you?
Please don't...

53:53.980 --> 53:56.982
Yes, I'm still holding
'cause that's what I do.
That's what I like to do.

53:58.985 --> 54:01.445
Sonia Baker's ex-roommate,
Rhonda Silver.

54:01.529 --> 54:02.947
Nobody's got her yet.

54:03.031 --> 54:06.200
She changed her
name a couple times
in the past year.

54:06.284 --> 54:07.743
How'd you get it?

54:07.827 --> 54:10.079
I had to agree
to go on not one,

54:10.205 --> 54:12.498
but two dates with
a sweaty guy named Vic.

54:14.709 --> 54:17.044
Don't even ask me.

54:17.295 --> 54:18.504
Hey, Bob, it's Cal.

54:18.588 --> 54:20.589
Want to run a Social
Security number for me?

54:26.846 --> 54:28.097
(EXCLAIMS)

54:28.181 --> 54:30.099
Rhonda Silver's number.

54:30.225 --> 54:32.142
Did we just break the law?

54:32.227 --> 54:34.270
Nope, that's what you call
damn fine reporting.

54:34.354 --> 54:36.188
Your pen.
Keep it.

54:37.565 --> 54:39.275
You're welcome!
Thank you!

54:41.987 --> 54:44.238
Hi. Is Rhonda there, please?

54:44.948 --> 54:47.241
I'm actually an old
friend of Rhonda's
from school.

54:47.325 --> 54:51.245
I'm in town for the day,
and I thought maybe
I'd stop by and see her.

54:51.329 --> 54:53.372
Do you think I could
show up at her work?

54:53.498 --> 54:55.541
Would that be all right?

55:09.222 --> 55:12.224
Actually, sir,
can I call you back?

55:13.810 --> 55:15.311
That page and the next page.

55:16.062 --> 55:18.689
HANK: This guy, Jerry Symes,
local politician,

55:18.773 --> 55:20.482
he campaigns
against the expansion,

55:20.608 --> 55:22.318
and then he dies in
a freak car accident.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.570
CAL: All right,
what does "freak
car accident" mean?

55:24.696 --> 55:26.488
Middle of the day...
He's driving on the
open road...

55:26.573 --> 55:27.614
No witnesses.
...30 miles an hour...

55:27.699 --> 55:29.116
Perfect weather,
no skid marks.
...car turns over.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.994
And the police think
it might be sleep apnea.

55:32.078 --> 55:35.080
Cal. Sorry,
I really need to talk to you.

55:37.459 --> 55:38.834
What do you got?

55:38.960 --> 55:40.336
So, I was looking
for images of Sonia

55:40.420 --> 55:42.880
in the Metro security
footage, right?

55:42.964 --> 55:47.801
And 20 seconds after
she went into the blind spot,
this guy appears.

55:48.470 --> 55:49.720
Okay?

55:52.557 --> 55:55.893
I think that I
saw him last night
at the hospital.

56:02.275 --> 56:03.901
Are you sure?

56:17.957 --> 56:19.541
Michael, it's Cal.

56:19.626 --> 56:23.337
Your PointCorp insider,
I need to meet him, now.

56:53.827 --> 56:55.411
I want you to know something.

56:55.537 --> 56:57.162
I love my country.

56:57.247 --> 56:58.372
I love the military.

56:58.498 --> 56:59.623
My aim here is to save them.

56:59.707 --> 57:00.874
You understand my terms?

57:00.959 --> 57:02.042
I will not give you my name.

57:02.127 --> 57:04.586
I will not give you
my rank in the PointCorp
military structure,

57:04.671 --> 57:06.380
or the in and out
dates of my service.

57:06.464 --> 57:07.965
Understand.

57:09.384 --> 57:11.051
CAL: I'm looking for
a guy that PointCorp

57:11.177 --> 57:12.845
are using on
a covert operation.

57:12.929 --> 57:14.263
Total deniability.

57:14.347 --> 57:16.515
Our mutual friend
at DOD thought

57:16.683 --> 57:18.851
you might be able
to help us find him.

57:20.186 --> 57:22.855
I don't know.
I'll check it out.

57:25.650 --> 57:28.777
So, what's your understanding
of the PointCorp MO?

57:28.862 --> 57:30.279
Their MO?

57:30.363 --> 57:32.072
They do whatever
the hell they want.

57:32.532 --> 57:34.575
These soldiers are
answerable to no one.

57:34.701 --> 57:36.785
They're loyal to nothing
but a paycheck.

57:36.870 --> 57:39.538
It's the Muslim
terror gold rush.

57:39.664 --> 57:41.790
You've been watching
these hearings?
Yeah.

57:41.875 --> 57:44.293
So, the head of
the committee there,
Stephen Collins...

57:44.377 --> 57:45.502
He's finished.

57:45.587 --> 57:47.921
They'll just keep
knocking him down
until he goes away.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.840
Do you have any idea
what he's threatening here?

57:49.924 --> 57:53.010
This is $30 or $40
billion annually.

57:53.094 --> 57:54.720
That's wrath of God money.

57:54.804 --> 57:57.097
The hearings
are saying 3 or 4.

57:57.182 --> 57:59.683
Overseas. The real
money is what PointCorp

57:59.809 --> 58:02.352
stands to make in its
domestic operations.

58:02.770 --> 58:04.646
I wasn't aware
that they had any.

58:04.731 --> 58:08.901
Who was sent in
for crowd control
after Hurricane Katrina? Us.

58:09.402 --> 58:11.236
Private security
contractors deputized

58:11.362 --> 58:13.197
to shoot at
American citizens.

58:14.032 --> 58:17.326
Who's training
Chicago police on new
interrogation techniques?

58:17.952 --> 58:20.662
Soon, PointCorp will
take over from the NSA

58:20.788 --> 58:23.540
on phone taps,
terrorist databases,
all of it.

58:24.292 --> 58:26.168
It's a fundamental
restructuring

58:26.252 --> 58:28.337
of domestic
intelligence policy.

58:29.088 --> 58:31.965
It is the privatization
of Homeland Security.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.468
Billions and
billions of dollars.

58:34.802 --> 58:37.262
Now you really think
they're gonna
forfeit all that

58:37.347 --> 58:39.264
because some hero
from the seventh district

58:39.432 --> 58:41.350
of Pennsylvania thinks
that they should?

58:41.434 --> 58:42.434
Hey.

58:44.062 --> 58:47.064
CAL: I just got told
by a former
PointCorp employee

58:47.148 --> 58:49.775
that they have a plan
to monopolize
domestic security

58:49.859 --> 58:51.568
that's worth about
$40 billion a year.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.362
Is that true?

58:53.446 --> 58:55.239
STEPHEN: Yes.
CAL: How?

58:55.323 --> 58:57.866
You cannot connect anything
that I tell you back to me.

58:57.951 --> 58:59.117
You understand?
Of course.

58:59.202 --> 59:00.202
Okay.

59:01.329 --> 59:04.540
Last year, 47 companies
bid on major Homeland
Security contracts.

59:04.624 --> 59:07.251
Of those,
16 companies were
granted the bids.

59:07.335 --> 59:11.380
Of those,
I could make connections
between 14 companies,

59:11.464 --> 59:13.423
and I'm not
just talking about someone
leaving one company

59:13.508 --> 59:14.550
and go work for another.

59:14.634 --> 59:16.468
I'm talking about
shared banking practices.

59:16.594 --> 59:18.387
I'm talking about
collusive behavior.

59:18.471 --> 59:20.806
Now, my belief is,
when all's said and done

59:20.974 --> 59:23.267
and when
the veil is pulled away,

59:23.351 --> 59:26.478
you will not see 14
individual companies.

59:27.146 --> 59:30.983
You will see one company.
You understand?

59:32.318 --> 59:33.527
And you've been
digging around

59:33.653 --> 59:34.861
trying to make
those connections clear.

59:34.946 --> 59:36.780
Yeah. That's right.

59:37.991 --> 59:39.992
And Sonia was
working on that?

59:40.076 --> 59:41.952
She was my lead researcher.

59:42.078 --> 59:43.954
She was involved in
everything we did.

59:44.038 --> 59:46.623
They're gonna
get you, Stephen,
one way or another.

59:46.708 --> 59:50.252
They got 40
billion good reasons to want
you out of the way.

59:50.336 --> 59:51.712
You gotta go on the record.

59:51.838 --> 59:53.213
Swing the spotlight
back on them.

59:53.298 --> 59:55.799
You gotta
protect yourself, man.

59:57.051 --> 1:00:00.721
You go out there
and find me evidence

1:00:01.347 --> 1:00:04.141
linking Sonia's
death to PointCorp.

1:00:05.893 --> 1:00:08.228
I will go on the record.

1:00:08.354 --> 1:00:10.689
I will shout this thing
from the rooftops.

1:00:11.691 --> 1:00:13.275
I can do that.

1:00:17.238 --> 1:00:20.907
All right.
I gotta get back.
I'll be in touch.

1:00:20.992 --> 1:00:22.909
Stephen.
Yeah?

1:00:23.536 --> 1:00:25.329
Just watch your back.

1:00:25.455 --> 1:00:27.205
You, too.

1:00:36.466 --> 1:00:38.216
Hi. Is Rhonda here?

1:00:38.384 --> 1:00:40.135
Yeah, she's just
right over there.

1:00:40.928 --> 1:00:41.928
(SINGING) Whoa

1:00:42.055 --> 1:00:44.264
I'm walking on sunshine

1:00:44.599 --> 1:00:46.308
Whoa

1:00:46.434 --> 1:00:48.977
I'm walking on sunshine

1:00:49.062 --> 1:00:50.687
Whoa

1:00:50.897 --> 1:00:52.773
And don't it feel good

1:00:52.982 --> 1:00:53.982
Yeah!

1:00:54.192 --> 1:00:57.569
DELLA: Cal, you're not gonna
believe what Sonia's old
roommate just told me.

1:00:58.529 --> 1:01:00.822
You're right.
I don't believe
a word of it.

1:01:00.907 --> 1:01:03.033
You got no corroboration,
no independent witness,

1:01:03.117 --> 1:01:05.202
and she obviously has
a financial motivation.

1:01:05.286 --> 1:01:07.287
We've got Sonia
Baker's roommate claiming

1:01:07.372 --> 1:01:09.331
she had a threesome
with Stephen Collins,

1:01:09.415 --> 1:01:10.499
and you want to ignore that?

1:01:10.583 --> 1:01:13.168
I am not saying ignore it.
I am saying consider it.

1:01:13.252 --> 1:01:15.170
Consider how it impacts
everything else we have,

1:01:15.254 --> 1:01:17.172
and consider that
she is full of shit!

1:01:17.256 --> 1:01:19.549
Yeah, but, Cal,
she's also saying

1:01:19.634 --> 1:01:23.011
that Stephen paid off
Sonia's $40,000
credit card debt.

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:24.388
That is a story.

1:01:24.472 --> 1:01:26.306
Somebody's gonna put that
on the front page.

1:01:26.391 --> 1:01:29.101
Okay, is that
the right thing to do?

1:01:29.185 --> 1:01:32.521
Look, it's your half
of the story.
It's your scoop.

1:01:32.605 --> 1:01:35.273
Your decision.
Do whatever you want.

1:01:44.951 --> 1:01:47.786
ANNE: But I do know
that Stephen and I

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:50.789
have been through
far too much together

1:01:50.873 --> 1:01:54.543
to make this one moment
the thing that
defines us forever.

1:01:54.627 --> 1:01:55.961
REPORTER: The political
future...

1:02:11.185 --> 1:02:12.894
I tried to call.

1:02:13.396 --> 1:02:17.691
I mean, I actually
did call about 12 times,
but I hung up every time.

1:02:18.317 --> 1:02:21.236
Well, you know,
I'm glad you dropped by,

1:02:22.071 --> 1:02:24.823
'cause I've been
wanting to talk to you.

1:02:28.453 --> 1:02:30.996
Remember you
brought that girl
from Humboldt?

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:32.456
Soleil,
or whatever her name was.

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:33.623
Luna.

1:02:33.708 --> 1:02:36.334
Luna. That's right.

1:02:36.836 --> 1:02:40.088
And you two were
stoned the whole time.

1:02:40.173 --> 1:02:41.173
Yep.

1:02:41.257 --> 1:02:43.133
You managed to flip the boat,
and we lost everything.

1:02:43.217 --> 1:02:44.259
We had to walk
the rest of the way...

1:02:44.343 --> 1:02:45.427
We flipped the boat?

1:02:45.511 --> 1:02:46.595
You did.

1:02:47.305 --> 1:02:48.930
It was an adventure.

1:02:49.515 --> 1:02:51.183
That's what you kept saying.

1:02:51.684 --> 1:02:52.768
Irish wine.

1:02:52.894 --> 1:02:54.019
Whiskey?

1:02:55.396 --> 1:02:57.147
Cheers.
Sláinte.

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:04.488
So...
So...

1:03:06.365 --> 1:03:07.783
I've been...
I wanted to ask...

1:03:07.867 --> 1:03:09.701
Sorry.
You first.

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:13.497
I was wondering,

1:03:16.250 --> 1:03:21.004
do you think Stephen
could have pulled together
$40,000 without you knowing?

1:03:21.088 --> 1:03:22.214
What?

1:03:22.298 --> 1:03:23.465
Well, it's a story
that might break

1:03:23.549 --> 1:03:26.051
that basically
accuses Stephen
of doing something

1:03:26.135 --> 1:03:30.472
that would require
his having access
to a large amount of cash.

1:03:30.556 --> 1:03:33.391
I was just wondering,
could he do that?

1:03:33.476 --> 1:03:34.684
A story that might break?

1:03:34.769 --> 1:03:36.645
You mean something that
you're involved in?

1:03:36.729 --> 1:03:38.522
Indirectly.
What are you doing?

1:03:38.606 --> 1:03:41.358
I'm trying to help Stephen.
I'm trying to protect you.

1:03:41.901 --> 1:03:43.443
Bullshit!

1:03:44.237 --> 1:03:45.237
(SIGHS)

1:03:45.738 --> 1:03:47.739
You always do this.

1:03:49.408 --> 1:03:52.577
Sometimes I feel like
we all made this deal,

1:03:52.662 --> 1:03:56.706
and it works out
great for you and Stephen,
and not for me.

1:03:56.791 --> 1:03:58.166
And instead of us
just figuring it out,

1:03:58.251 --> 1:04:02.462
you guys are just
fine walking around
as if nothing ever happened.

1:04:08.094 --> 1:04:09.344
Okay.

1:04:13.099 --> 1:04:14.891
Okay, let's start over.

1:04:14.976 --> 1:04:16.351
I come here to tell you
that I'm thinking

1:04:16.435 --> 1:04:17.769
about walking away
from my marriage,

1:04:17.854 --> 1:04:19.604
and you say what?

1:04:20.481 --> 1:04:23.942
I say it's too late.
We're way past this.

1:04:24.986 --> 1:04:26.695
You made your choice.

1:04:26.779 --> 1:04:28.196

wouldn't step up.

you're asking me

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:39.624

that's not real.

We've got
the apartment here.

Basically, we spend
everything we make,

1:05:06.986 --> 1:05:10.780

Stephen could have
given anyone $40,000

1:05:10.865 --> 1:05:13.158

knowing about it.

It's okay.

He's definitely a grunt.

at security trade shows.

for an old-timer

connect Sonia Baker
to PointCorp,

he might tell us,
all right?

That's our insurance.

he's even gonna talk to you?

1:20:10.430 --> 1:20:12.431
I got something I want
to run by you, all right?

1:20:12.516 --> 1:20:14.850
It ain't finished.
I'm still working it up.

1:20:14.976 --> 1:20:17.353
Let's see how
you feel about this.

1:20:17.938 --> 1:20:20.564
"Dominic Foy, a D.C.
Public relations figure

1:20:20.649 --> 1:20:23.526
"with known ties
to defense contractor
PointCorp

1:20:23.610 --> 1:20:25.236
"was yesterday
linked to the death

1:20:25.403 --> 1:20:27.029
"of Capitol Hill
staffer Sonia Baker."

1:20:27.113 --> 1:20:29.365
Come on.
Are you a reporter?

1:20:29.449 --> 1:20:32.076
This is not cool.
This is definitely not cool.

1:20:32.244 --> 1:20:33.953
Very unprofessional.
I'm just sitting here...

1:20:34.037 --> 1:20:35.329
Cal McAffrey from the Globe.

1:20:35.455 --> 1:20:36.789
Congratulations. Keep it.

1:20:36.873 --> 1:20:38.999
That's gonna run
tomorrow unless

1:20:39.084 --> 1:20:40.417
you can tell me what
I need to know today.

1:20:40.502 --> 1:20:42.294
I don't think so.
I got a car out the back.

1:20:42.379 --> 1:20:44.505
I got a nice, safe place
where you and I can talk.

1:20:44.589 --> 1:20:48.008
Hey, hey, Saab.
I don't know anything about
anything, all right?

1:20:48.093 --> 1:20:50.135
I'm a PR guy. Got it?

1:20:50.220 --> 1:20:52.012
Be that as it may,
there's two ways

1:20:52.097 --> 1:20:54.056
this article
can run, Dominic.

1:20:54.349 --> 1:20:57.476
Without your name
or with your name,

1:20:57.561 --> 1:21:00.020
and maybe even
a photo from your website.

1:21:00.105 --> 1:21:03.649
Now, who knows who
that's gonna piss off
and how badly?

1:21:03.733 --> 1:21:06.026
I'm trying to be
your friend, Dominic,
all right?

1:21:06.111 --> 1:21:09.905
I'd hate to see you
end up under a train
like Sonia Baker.

1:21:11.074 --> 1:21:13.534
And you promised never
to use my name, right?

1:21:13.618 --> 1:21:14.869
Yes, I did.

1:21:14.953 --> 1:21:16.745
This place is nice?
It's classy?

1:21:16.872 --> 1:21:18.664
I'm gonna be
comfortable?
Uh-huh.

1:21:37.893 --> 1:21:39.643
DOMINIC: What kind
of dump is this?

1:21:39.811 --> 1:21:41.562
Where have you brought me?

1:21:41.646 --> 1:21:43.188
No booze in the mini-bar.

1:21:43.273 --> 1:21:45.524
There's no
On Demand on the TV.

1:21:45.775 --> 1:21:47.067
What kind of hotel is this?

1:21:47.152 --> 1:21:48.944
Little bit more of a motel,
I'd say, isn't it?

1:21:49.029 --> 1:21:50.905
CAL: Nobody's gonna find
you here, Dominic.

1:21:50.989 --> 1:21:52.573
DOMINIC:
How are your beer-getting
skills, sweet pea?

1:21:52.657 --> 1:21:54.992
You want to go get
Uncle Foy a nice frosty?

1:21:55.660 --> 1:21:56.869
I'll time you.
Christ.

1:21:56.995 --> 1:21:59.079
So, let's start
from the beginning.

1:21:59.205 --> 1:22:01.332
Where did you
meet Sonia Baker?

1:22:02.500 --> 1:22:04.001
Why don't we start
with a little compensation?

1:22:04.085 --> 1:22:07.421
This guy's
stoned off his face,
and now he wants a beer.

1:22:07.505 --> 1:22:09.423
Can I have one?
Yeah.

1:22:09.507 --> 1:22:11.258
What's he
taking exactly?

1:22:11.343 --> 1:22:14.553
Dude, downers.
This guy's losing his shit.

1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:18.223
For what? For what?
Me helping you out.

1:22:18.308 --> 1:22:20.643
Me losing my business. Me...

1:22:20.727 --> 1:22:22.770
This bed's disgusting.

1:22:22.896 --> 1:22:24.939
Compensate me, okay?

1:22:25.023 --> 1:22:28.943
Okay, so you want to be paid
to help solve Sonia's murder?

1:22:29.027 --> 1:22:30.903
(SIGHS) Save it, all right?
I'm in PR.

1:22:30.987 --> 1:22:32.279
I know a little bit
about phrasing questions.

1:22:32.364 --> 1:22:33.822
Why don't you try
phrasing it like this?

1:22:33.907 --> 1:22:36.951
Would I like to be paid
for helping you
get a book deal?

1:22:37.035 --> 1:22:38.452
Nobody's here
for a book deal.

1:22:38.536 --> 1:22:39.954
Really?
Everybody wants a book deal.

1:22:40.038 --> 1:22:42.289
And I'd like my cut, okay?
That's just fair.

1:22:42.374 --> 1:22:43.958
When did you meet Sonia?

1:22:44.084 --> 1:22:45.668
Compensation,
compensation.

1:22:45.752 --> 1:22:47.169
You came here
to talk, Dominic.

1:22:47.253 --> 1:22:50.297
You know, mouse,
I'm the talent and I
don't like the vibe.

1:22:50.382 --> 1:22:52.716
So why don't you
change that up, okay?

1:22:52.801 --> 1:22:54.009
It's a non-smoking room.

1:22:54.135 --> 1:22:55.344
It's under your name.

1:22:56.221 --> 1:22:58.097
He's a douche.
I love this guy.

1:22:58.181 --> 1:22:59.890
I want to call my lawyer.

1:23:00.016 --> 1:23:01.725
I think you should
think that through.

1:23:01.810 --> 1:23:03.852
Can we get a signal
in this rat hole?

1:23:03.979 --> 1:23:06.397
Why don't you
think it through? Hmm?

1:23:06.690 --> 1:23:09.149
Dominic, let me just lay this
out for you one more time,

1:23:09.234 --> 1:23:10.484
because I don't
think you're getting it!

1:23:10.568 --> 1:23:12.152
So I'll lay it out
for you! Okay?
Relax.

1:23:12.237 --> 1:23:14.655
I'll lay it out for
you nice and clear!

1:23:14.739 --> 1:23:17.992
The newspaper can slant this
any which way they want to,

1:23:18.076 --> 1:23:21.161
and they can make you
the one and only
principal source.

1:23:21.246 --> 1:23:22.538
How do you think
that's gonna go down

1:23:22.622 --> 1:23:24.164
with your friends
at PointCorp?
Not great.

1:23:24.249 --> 1:23:25.332
And anybody else
you're connected to?

1:23:25.417 --> 1:23:27.710
Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

1:23:33.717 --> 1:23:37.886
The more you talk,
the more you give us,

1:23:39.389 --> 1:23:41.056
the more protected you are.

1:23:41.182 --> 1:23:42.891
That's the way we work.

1:23:44.853 --> 1:23:47.771
And your compensation
is your anonymity,

1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:51.275
and that is all you're
gonna get from us.

1:23:57.949 --> 1:23:59.825
Okay?
Yeah.

1:24:00.618 --> 1:24:02.119
Great.

1:24:02.203 --> 1:24:03.328
DELLA: Okay, how's
it going in here?

1:24:03.413 --> 1:24:05.372
Sounds frigging great.
We're just about ready.

1:24:05.790 --> 1:24:07.332
Let's do it.
DELLA: Great. Good.

1:24:07.417 --> 1:24:08.375
Come on.

1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:09.918
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm gonna open the door,

1:24:10.003 --> 1:24:11.211
and I'm gonna
let you say it.

1:24:11.296 --> 1:24:12.504
You have to talk to her.

1:24:12.589 --> 1:24:13.964
Cal is asking us to
push the deadline.

1:24:14.049 --> 1:24:15.382
We really can't
afford to keep doing

1:24:15.467 --> 1:24:16.717
this type of thing.
Where the hell are they?

1:24:16.801 --> 1:24:18.594
(EXCLAIMS) You saying that
as if I should know?

1:24:18.678 --> 1:24:19.887
Yeah, well, you just
spoke to him.

1:24:19.971 --> 1:24:21.555
Yeah, well,
they didn't tell
me where they were.

1:24:21.639 --> 1:24:22.806
$20,000 an hour.

1:24:22.891 --> 1:24:24.308
Yeah... All right!

1:24:24.392 --> 1:24:25.851
Bugger off!

1:24:32.192 --> 1:24:33.192
Shit.

1:24:36.446 --> 1:24:40.991
It was just this guy, okay,
that I knew from
the clubs, all right?

1:24:41.076 --> 1:24:43.327
And he worked
for a PR firm,
a very big one.

1:24:43.411 --> 1:24:45.370
Name?
And... No, I'm not gonna
give you his name.

1:24:45.455 --> 1:24:47.998
He's a friend, okay?
He had this, uh...

1:24:48.124 --> 1:24:49.416
He had this...

1:24:49.501 --> 1:24:50.793
Well, the company
that he worked
for had a client,

1:24:50.877 --> 1:24:53.087
a very special client.
Name?

1:24:53.671 --> 1:24:56.090
I'll give you that one.
PointCorp.

1:24:56.174 --> 1:24:58.342
And they wanted
a special employee.

1:24:59.427 --> 1:25:01.178
They needed a girl.

1:25:02.639 --> 1:25:04.890
I thought of Sonia.

1:25:08.937 --> 1:25:10.354
You got that?

1:25:12.816 --> 1:25:16.068
I'm sorry, are you saying
that Sonia was working
for PointCorp?

1:25:16.194 --> 1:25:18.028
Like a steel trap,
this one.

1:25:18.196 --> 1:25:19.988
Don't lose her
to another paper.

1:25:20.073 --> 1:25:21.115
Yeah, that's
what I'm saying.

1:25:21.199 --> 1:25:23.033
Turn it up, turn it up.

1:25:23.243 --> 1:25:24.952
DOMINIC:
She was a perfect fit.
She had balls.

1:25:25.036 --> 1:25:27.037
She was smart.
She was in debt.

1:25:27.122 --> 1:25:28.288
And she was
in debt, exactly. Yeah.

1:25:28.373 --> 1:25:31.291
They paid her
$26,000 a month.

1:25:31.376 --> 1:25:32.668
Whole hell of a lot
more than they gave me.

1:25:32.752 --> 1:25:33.794
They paid me
a flat 20.
It's big.

1:25:33.878 --> 1:25:35.295
Did they tell you
what the job was?

1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:37.214
No, they did not.
She told me what
it was, though.

1:25:37.298 --> 1:25:38.382
She told me about Collins.

1:25:38.466 --> 1:25:39.883
She told me
about spying on him.

1:25:40.343 --> 1:25:43.137
And did they want Sonia
to sleep with Collins?

1:25:43.221 --> 1:25:45.472
No. She got on her
back all by herself

1:25:45.598 --> 1:25:47.891
and screwed
everything up,
didn't she?

1:25:48.393 --> 1:25:50.477
How did they get her
onto Collins' staff?

1:25:50.562 --> 1:25:52.354
That I'm not gonna tell you.
You can forget it.

1:25:52.438 --> 1:25:55.691
You can kidnap and torture
someone else for that toughie.

1:25:55.775 --> 1:25:56.900
We have a deal.
Yeah.

1:25:56.985 --> 1:25:58.986
I've done my work.
Nobody's here
to screw you,

1:25:59.070 --> 1:26:02.698
but we need to know
who was working
this on the Hill.

1:26:02.782 --> 1:26:04.032
Mmm-hmm.

1:26:04.868 --> 1:26:08.203
From the Hill, huh?
Well, from the Hill,
they found a guy to fix it.

1:26:08.288 --> 1:26:09.621
Name?
No.

1:26:09.998 --> 1:26:11.582
Who?
Leave it.

1:26:11.666 --> 1:26:12.833
Who?
Come on.

1:26:12.917 --> 1:26:14.084
What, are you
not hearing me?

1:26:14.169 --> 1:26:16.378
Forget it. I'd be
afraid to start that

1:26:16.462 --> 1:26:18.922
sweet ass Caddy
every morning.

1:26:20.258 --> 1:26:21.842
I mean, keep in mind
if I was driving

1:26:21.926 --> 1:26:23.427
that wheelbarrow
Saab of yours,

1:26:23.511 --> 1:26:26.054
I'd probably blow it up
myself with me in it.

1:26:27.056 --> 1:26:30.475
You seen that thing?
It's like a lawnmower.

1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:32.853
I'm gonna get you
another beer.

1:26:33.563 --> 1:26:34.813
Hey.

1:26:35.565 --> 1:26:36.565
Oi.

1:26:36.649 --> 1:26:39.151
Are you sleeping
with that guy?

1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:42.404
I mean, what are
you doing here?

1:26:42.530 --> 1:26:44.573
Are you sleeping
with him? Hmm?

1:26:44.657 --> 1:26:47.159
Or you got a guy.
You got a guy, right?

1:26:47.952 --> 1:26:49.286
DOMINIC: Donna?

1:26:49.787 --> 1:26:51.371
DELLA: Della.
DOMINIC: Della.

1:26:52.290 --> 1:26:55.667
I got a guy.
Got a girl, too.

1:26:56.127 --> 1:26:57.836
Right? I don't want
to leave anybody out.

1:26:57.921 --> 1:27:00.005
Hey, Stephen.
How did you find Sonia?

1:27:00.632 --> 1:27:01.882
STEPHEN: What?

1:27:01.966 --> 1:27:03.133
How did she come to
work in your office?

1:27:03.218 --> 1:27:04.801
Was somebody...
Did somebody recommend her?

1:27:04.886 --> 1:27:06.303
What are you talking about?

1:27:06.429 --> 1:27:07.846
I think you've been played.

1:27:07.931 --> 1:27:08.889
Really?

1:27:08.973 --> 1:27:10.599
Who gave you her name?

1:27:10.808 --> 1:27:12.559
What is this about?
Don't dick around about this,

1:27:12.644 --> 1:27:14.102
Stephen, all right?
Two questions.

1:27:14.187 --> 1:27:15.687
How the hell did she come
to work in your office,

1:27:15.772 --> 1:27:18.607
and the name of
the individual
who recommended her?

1:27:21.444 --> 1:27:25.364
Fergus. George Fergus.

1:27:26.199 --> 1:27:28.992
Said she was the daughter
of an old family friend.

1:27:32.497 --> 1:27:33.705
Doug Sponder's
bachelor party.

1:27:33.790 --> 1:27:36.250
You remember that hotel,
the Americana?

1:27:36.334 --> 1:27:37.542
Yes.

1:27:37.627 --> 1:27:42.130
Get here now, alone.
I'm in Room 408.

1:27:46.094 --> 1:27:47.427
I'll meet you
at the office.

1:27:47.512 --> 1:27:48.762
Stephen, we're
late already.

1:27:48.846 --> 1:27:49.930
I'll call in.

1:27:50.014 --> 1:27:51.682
Stephen, we are
late already.

1:27:51.766 --> 1:27:52.891
I'll call in.
Okay.

1:27:56.145 --> 1:27:57.479
(SIGHS)

1:28:02.860 --> 1:28:03.902
Don't check
your voicemail.

1:28:03.987 --> 1:28:07.364
Cameron's going
on a rampage
about this deadline.

1:28:07.448 --> 1:28:08.782
So, did you cue it
where I asked?

1:28:08.866 --> 1:28:10.200
HANK: Close enough.

1:28:10.285 --> 1:28:13.620
Okay. So, guys,
I'm gonna need you
to clear the room.

1:28:13.788 --> 1:28:15.539
That means you, too.
What?

1:28:18.543 --> 1:28:20.335
CAL: I got Stephen Collins
coming in here.

1:28:20.420 --> 1:28:22.004
It's gonna be a lot
more comfortable for him

1:28:22.130 --> 1:28:23.714
if you're not here,
all right?

1:28:24.757 --> 1:28:25.882
Tell me you're kidding.

1:28:28.177 --> 1:28:30.804
DELLA: Since when does
the subject of an
investigation

1:28:30.888 --> 1:28:33.390
get his own private
preview of another
subject's interview?

1:28:33.474 --> 1:28:34.808
That's crazy!

1:28:34.892 --> 1:28:36.893
You're polluting the story!

Sonia and I began

1:40:59.636 --> 1:41:02.472
a romantic relationship.

1:41:03.348 --> 1:41:08.728
STEPHEN: I have e-mailed
copies of documents to you,
which show beyond doubt

1:41:09.063 --> 1:41:11.731
the corruption between
members of my own party.

1:41:11.815 --> 1:41:17.070
I now know
that she had been placed
in my office as a spy.

1:41:17.154 --> 1:41:19.280
PointCorp's tentacles reach
into every corner

1:41:19.364 --> 1:41:21.240
of the ever-growing
private security industry,

1:41:21.325 --> 1:41:22.825
both at home and abroad.

1:41:22.910 --> 1:41:24.368
Not only does
this pose a great...

1:41:24.495 --> 1:41:25.953
But it is
a violation of our laws.

1:41:26.038 --> 1:41:27.080
A monopolistic business...

1:41:27.164 --> 1:41:29.373
...obstruct and
otherwise destroy

1:41:29.500 --> 1:41:31.751
my investigation
into PointCorp.

1:41:32.669 --> 1:41:35.922
Sonia was paid
to make regular reports
to PointCorp...

1:41:36.006 --> 1:41:38.716
Left unchecked, I believe
that within five years,

1:41:38.801 --> 1:41:41.302
PointCorp will have
its own standing army
on US soil.

1:41:41.386 --> 1:41:42.678
...into their
fraudulent practices...

1:41:42.763 --> 1:41:45.098
It will control our
intelligence-gathering
apparatus...

1:41:45.182 --> 1:41:47.934
What happened in committee...
She had access to
everything we were doing

1:41:48.018 --> 1:41:49.685
and effectively crippled
our investigation.

1:41:49.770 --> 1:41:53.731
It is a frightening vision
and one which must be stopped.

1:41:55.526 --> 1:41:59.153
However, when
my relationship with her grew,

1:41:59.655 --> 1:42:02.657
she ceased her spying
on their behalf,

1:42:02.741 --> 1:42:05.576
and I believe
they killed her for it.

1:42:08.705 --> 1:42:10.123
STEPHEN: For people like this,
who I've spent

1:42:10.207 --> 1:42:13.167
the last year and a half
of my life investigating...

1:42:13.252 --> 1:42:18.005
Innocent civilians are
really little more than
disposable lives,

1:42:18.090 --> 1:42:21.634
thought of as
collateral damage.

1:42:23.053 --> 1:42:26.305
And I believe it was
simply the public nature
of my position that

1:42:28.142 --> 1:42:30.518
saved me
from a similar fate.

1:42:33.647 --> 1:42:38.734
So, as political suicides go,

1:42:40.028 --> 1:42:41.737
how was that?

1:46:21.416 --> 1:46:25.044
Yeah, yeah,
I think it is.

1:46:33.220 --> 1:46:36.472
So, how old are you?
Actually, don't tell me.

1:46:36.556 --> 1:46:38.099
It would just
make me sick.

1:46:38.183 --> 1:46:39.850
You never ask
a girl her age.

1:46:40.352 --> 1:46:43.396
Well, see, I look at you,
and I don't see a girl.
I just see a reporter.

1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:45.981
(SIGHS) At last.
Anyway, back to the story.

1:46:46.191 --> 1:46:47.191
Yes.

1:46:48.026 --> 1:46:50.486
So I had this, uh, English
teacher in high school.
Mmm-hmm.

1:46:50.570 --> 1:46:54.782
He was a kind of a longhaired
hippie kind of guy.
Mmm-hmm.

1:46:55.367 --> 1:46:57.993
He had
a pen problem. Yeah.
Oh.

1:46:58.495 --> 1:47:00.329
He solved it by
having a piece

1:47:00.497 --> 1:47:02.289
of leather string
around his neck,

1:47:02.374 --> 1:47:03.833
and that's where
he'd keep his pen.

1:47:04.292 --> 1:47:05.543
Smart.

1:47:05.669 --> 1:47:07.461
So I started thinking,

1:47:07.546 --> 1:47:10.131
"My friend Della's
got a pen problem.

1:47:10.298 --> 1:47:12.383

"How do I solve it?"

1:47:12.509 --> 1:47:14.427

with this.

1:47:21.351 --> 1:47:25.187
Oh, it's beautiful!
I always wanted one
of these.

1:47:29.901 --> 1:47:31.735
Cheers.
Cheers.

1:47:35.449 --> 1:47:39.368
You know, I wanted
to tell you something
about Anne Collins.

1:47:40.287 --> 1:47:41.579
Okay.

1:47:59.055 --> 1:48:01.056
I was just talking to her.

1:48:05.187 --> 1:48:06.187
How does Anne
Collins know that

1:48:06.271 --> 1:48:08.355
Sonia Baker was
earning $26,000 a month?

1:48:11.485 --> 1:48:12.568
What?

1:48:15.113 --> 1:48:17.031
How does she know
how much Sonia Baker
was earning?

1:48:17.115 --> 1:48:18.491
We know that.
Yeah.

1:48:18.575 --> 1:48:20.242
How does Anne
Collins know that?

1:48:20.327 --> 1:48:25.498
Well, I mean, Stephen
must have heard it
in the Foy interview.

1:48:26.416 --> 1:48:28.792
We played him
a specific part
of that tape,

1:48:28.919 --> 1:48:31.295
and that figure
is never mentioned.

1:48:49.523 --> 1:48:52.608
Cal. Wait,
what are you doing?

1:49:03.870 --> 1:49:06.789
DELLA: What are
you doing? Cal?

1:49:13.088 --> 1:49:14.380
You gonna fill me in?

1:49:14.464 --> 1:49:16.340
Just tell Cameron,
"Hold the story."

1:49:52.502 --> 1:49:54.712
Who's Robert Bingham,
Stephen?

1:50:06.641 --> 1:50:08.642
Who is Robert Bingham?

1:50:15.692 --> 1:50:17.276
(SIGHS)

1:50:27.245 --> 1:50:29.121
Are the police outside?

1:50:30.665 --> 1:50:32.041
No.

1:50:34.377 --> 1:50:37.546
I saved Robert Bingham's
life in Kuwait in '91.

1:50:38.548 --> 1:50:40.799
He was a 17-year-old kid.

1:50:40.925 --> 1:50:43.135
He was a good soldier.

1:50:43.219 --> 1:50:45.387
He was proud
of what we did.

1:50:46.222 --> 1:50:51.268
The Army was his life,
and he had problems
when he got discharged.

1:50:51.394 --> 1:50:54.313
So you had a guy that
you knew to be unstable

1:50:55.607 --> 1:50:58.651
do what, exactly?
Scare her?

1:50:58.735 --> 1:51:00.027
Maybe beat her up
a little?

1:51:00.111 --> 1:51:02.780
No, Cal.
I had him follow her.

1:51:03.198 --> 1:51:04.156
Why?

1:51:04.240 --> 1:51:07.368
Because I knew
she was hiding
something from me.

1:51:08.536 --> 1:51:09.828
Because when I'd...
I'd be at her house

1:51:09.913 --> 1:51:11.664
and a fax would come in,
she'd get nervous.

1:51:11.748 --> 1:51:14.333
Because there were
phone calls late at night.

1:51:14.417 --> 1:51:16.168
I was suspicious.

1:51:16.252 --> 1:51:19.963
I asked Bingham
to observe her
and report back to me.

1:51:20.048 --> 1:51:22.132
That's all.

1:51:23.510 --> 1:51:24.635
You're a liar, Stephen.

1:51:24.719 --> 1:51:27.471
He was more upset
about what she was
doing than I was.

1:51:27.555 --> 1:51:29.807
You have to understand
what the military
means to Bingham.

1:51:29.891 --> 1:51:32.351
He hates PointCorp
for what they're
trying to do to it.

1:51:32.435 --> 1:51:33.811
In his mind,
she just had to stop.

1:51:33.937 --> 1:51:35.354
But she did stop,
right?

1:51:35.438 --> 1:51:37.856
She tore up her paychecks,
and she put her life
at risk for you.

1:51:37.941 --> 1:51:40.067
Yes, but I didn't
know that.

1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:43.112
I didn't know that
he was gonna kill her.

1:51:43.655 --> 1:51:45.364
I didn't know
he had killed her.

1:51:45.448 --> 1:51:47.366
When I found out,
my thought was just
the same as yours.

1:51:47.450 --> 1:51:49.284
I thought PointCorp
had done it.

1:51:49.369 --> 1:51:50.369
And when you did
find out?

1:51:50.453 --> 1:51:51.412
What was
I supposed to do?

1:51:51.496 --> 1:51:53.163
Tell someone.
I tried.

1:51:53.248 --> 1:51:54.373
When?
When I came
to your house,

1:51:54.457 --> 1:51:55.666
and I wanted to
talk to you about it,

1:51:55.792 --> 1:51:56.834
and all you cared
about was the story.

1:51:56.918 --> 1:51:59.503
No, Stephen,
I cared about helping you.

1:51:59.587 --> 1:52:01.463
Bullshit. Bullshit.

1:52:01.548 --> 1:52:04.174
All you cared about was
clearing your conscience
over this little soap opera

1:52:04.259 --> 1:52:05.968
you have with Annie.
So you used me.

1:52:06.094 --> 1:52:07.428
No, Cal.
The same way
as you used Bingham.

1:52:07.512 --> 1:52:09.388
I was suspicious of her.
I brought him in.

1:52:09.514 --> 1:52:11.432
That's all it was!
It was a mistake!

1:52:11.516 --> 1:52:12.641
It's my responsibility.

1:52:12.809 --> 1:52:13.934
I should never
have done that.

1:52:14.018 --> 1:52:16.145
But I never asked
him to kill her.

1:52:16.312 --> 1:52:18.439
He owed you his life!

1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:22.401
That's why
you called him.

1:52:23.153 --> 1:52:25.446
You called him,
and you used him,

1:52:26.281 --> 1:52:28.699
like you've been
trying to use me.

1:52:29.325 --> 1:52:32.578
One to kill,
and one to cover it up.

1:52:32.829 --> 1:52:34.329
If PointCorp and
Fergus hadn't hired her,

1:52:34.456 --> 1:52:36.540
none of this
would've happened!
No. This is not about Bingham

1:52:36.624 --> 1:52:38.417
and PointCorp
and Fergus, man!

1:52:38.501 --> 1:52:42.045
It's about you
and the decisions
that you have made

1:52:42.130 --> 1:52:44.506
that have led to four
people being killed.

1:52:45.842 --> 1:52:48.802

Stephen.

1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:54.349

you gonna do?

1:58:37.026 --> 1:58:39.653
I'll be coming home soon

1:58:40.738 --> 1:58:44.449
Long as I can see the light

1:58:48.246 --> 1:58:52.374
Pack my bag
and let's get movin'

1:58:56.087 --> 1:59:00.340
'Cause I'm bound
to drift a while

1:59:03.511 --> 1:59:07.013
When I'm gone, gone

1:59:07.181 --> 1:59:09.766
You don't have to worry long

1:59:10.768 --> 1:59:15.021
Long as I can see the light

1:59:18.276 --> 1:59:22.154
Guess I've got
that old travlin' bone

1:59:26.200 --> 1:59:30.745
'Cause this feelin'
won't leave me alone

1:59:33.749 --> 1:59:37.252
But I won't, won't

1:59:37.587 --> 1:59:40.338
Be losing my way, no, no

1:59:41.048 --> 1:59:44.885
Long as I can see the light

1:59:48.598 --> 1:59:57.647
Yeah

1:59:59.108 --> 2:00:00.650
Oh, yeah

2:00:03.362 --> 2:00:07.115
Put a candle in the window

2:00:11.245 --> 2:00:15.123
'Cause I feel I've got to move

2:00:18.794 --> 2:00:22.255
Though I'm going, going

2:00:22.465 --> 2:00:24.841
I'll be coming home soon

2:00:26.093 --> 2:00:52.118
Long as I can see the light
