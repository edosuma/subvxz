00:28.763 --> 00:33.032
- ROSE: A long time ago
out of the vast darkness,

00:33.034 --> 00:36.802
God created this wonderful
ride we call life.

00:38.172 --> 00:41.807
He filled the world with
an abundance of beauty

00:41.809 --> 00:44.309
and endless possibilities.

00:45.446 --> 00:49.048
And yet we find ourselves
questioning his creation

00:49.050 --> 00:51.283
and our very own existence.

00:53.320 --> 00:58.257
Many people ask themselves
why are we put on this earth?

00:58.826 --> 01:01.126
What is our purpose?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.796
Why must we be challenged?

01:03.798 --> 01:07.132
with are we faced with so
many heartaches and failures?

01:08.335 --> 01:13.405
Why do bad things sometimes
happen to the very best of us?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.475
And what does God have in store?

01:39.733 --> 01:41.500
- Come on, we have to.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.102
It's for Mommy.

(SOFT MUSIC)

02:02.456 --> 02:03.388
- Go.

02:05.192 --> 02:08.660
- ROSE: My family was
my world, my purpose.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.296
They kept me alive and smiling.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.167
They're a constant reminder
of how great God is.

02:15.169 --> 02:18.537
My sons Ryan and Tim were
the most sacred blessings

02:18.539 --> 02:21.206
God has ever bestowed upon me.

02:21.208 --> 02:24.176
I was their protector
and teacher.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.911
I rejoiced when they rejoiced.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.147
I hurt when they hurt.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.882
I watched them in bewilderment.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.283
Clung to them.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.919
Did all I could
to keep them safe.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.388
- Ma, have you gone
yet with the hopscotch?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.823
- ROSE: No, you.

02:37.825 --> 02:38.891
You first.

02:47.301 --> 02:50.402
Ryan, aren't we
going to say grace?

02:52.573 --> 02:55.340
- Is it Thanksgiving already?

02:57.878 --> 02:59.811
- Did you really just say that?

02:59.813 --> 03:01.380
- GRACE: Yes he did.

03:01.382 --> 03:05.317
- Are we gonna have a Bible
study or are we gonna eat?

03:05.319 --> 03:10.255
- TIM: That's enough, Ryan,
you're disappointing mom.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.258
- Thank you, Lord, for this food

03:13.260 --> 03:14.860
that we are about to receive.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.461
Please bless this family.

03:16.463 --> 03:17.329
Amen.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.397
- Amen.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.439
- You see what I saw?

03:27.441 --> 03:28.340
- Yeah.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.409
- It's too bad.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.913
You gonna tell him
or you want me to?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.615
- I'll do it.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.649
- Alright.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.484
Let him know I signed off on it.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.385
- Will do.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.793
You get the email?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.595
- I haven't checked.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.430
- Give it a look.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.432
That's the Goodwin file.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.334
- Did Doctor Harris
sign off on this?

03:55.336 --> 03:56.001
- Yes.

03:56.870 --> 03:57.936
- Okay.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.339
What do you think?

04:00.341 --> 04:03.875
- I think the X-rays
speaks for itself.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.379
How much time do
you think she has?

04:07.381 --> 04:10.515
- DOCTOR: She came
in too late for time.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.450
- Poor thing.

04:12.920 --> 04:17.389
- Yeah, she didn't
even know she had it.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.490
- You want me to?

04:18.492 --> 04:19.423
- No.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.559
I'll do it.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.599
Hello, Mister Goodwin.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.469
Yes, this is Doctor Sherman.

04:30.471 --> 04:34.439
I have the results
of your wife's test

04:34.441 --> 04:38.477
and I would like you both
to come in and see me.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.713
I'd rather discuss that with
you in person, Mister Goodwin.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.781
Okay.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.682
Thank you.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.053
- ROSE: My poor Ian.

04:48.055 --> 04:53.058
With no faith in God, who
would he turn to for comfort?

04:57.698 --> 04:58.897
That's my boy, Ryan.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.799
Company executive, family man.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.501
He had it all.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.037
But just when you're
feeling on top of the world,

05:05.039 --> 05:08.674
darkness may be lurking
around the corner.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.711
- Three.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.546
Two.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.547
Let's go.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.381
Energy, energy.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.084
- This is Robbie
Martin from Odensoft.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.087
I'm calling about our
exciting new Gen 1.1 software.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.089
- I'm calling to tell you about
an exciting new opportunity.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.590
It's called Generation 1.1.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.426
- You see, that's
how a company runs.

05:27.428 --> 05:31.730
Companies run on efficiency
and Gen 1.1 is exactly it.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.598
- This is Robbie from Odensoft.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.901
I need to speak to the accountants
in charge of acquisition.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.536
Hello, hello, hello.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.004
- Just let's get on
the next call please.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.105
- Gen 1.1 Linda.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.940
- Gen 1.1, hi my name is Linda.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.475
I'm gonna be in your area.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.711
I'd like to talk to
you about the Gen 1.1.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.347
- Anything you need
you come to me, okay?

05:48.349 --> 05:49.548
- How am I supposed to know?

05:49.550 --> 05:50.782
- Gotta keep trying.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.652
- Robbie, it's
autograph time, buddy.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.623
- Jay, how many of these
are you gonna ask me to do?

05:58.625 --> 06:00.525
- As many as I want.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.963
Thank you.

06:08.369 --> 06:11.370
Can you just tighten
that up a little bit?

06:11.372 --> 06:13.505
- If you don't like
how I do it, you sign.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.840
- Sorry.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.708
Please carry on.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.609
Thank you.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.114
- That's better.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.519
- Thought you and
Ryan were friends?

06:27.521 --> 06:28.720
- 20 years.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.155
- These guys don't play fair.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.057
They're not altar boys.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.960
- Todd, what are
they talking about?

06:34.962 --> 06:35.961
- Come on, Marty.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.496
Sounds like sour grapes to me.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.431
- I should give your
guys parking spots

06:39.433 --> 06:41.833
they're in my territory so much.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.101
Old man Rogers.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.603
Goodwin and his team.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.538
They've been trying to
steal the Kaufmann account

06:46.540 --> 06:48.006
for a long time.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.175
- I wanna see every one
of your sales managers.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.077
I wanna see your salesmen.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.445
I am livid.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.552
- Morning boss.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.989
- I know your team poached
all those accounts.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.057
- Come on, Marty.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.160
Show me one team
that closes deals

07:08.162 --> 07:10.429
inside their region strictly.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.063
Everybody does it
everywhere okay.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.633
What's the big deal, Marty?

07:20.441 --> 07:23.008
- So who signed the bottom
of those accounts, Jay?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.609
Who signed off?

07:26.713 --> 07:27.579
- Jay.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.447
- JAY: What?

07:28.449 --> 07:30.615
- Who signed the deals?

07:34.588 --> 07:37.673
- That's better.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.759
- Hey, you better give me a
name or you're getting fired.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.162
- Ryan.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.469
Look, it was Ryan's
idea in the first place.

07:50.471 --> 07:55.106
I don't know who signed
'em but it was Ryan's idea.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.575
- WOMAN: Mister
Goodwin, Todd would like

07:56.577 --> 07:58.877
to see you in his office
as soon as possible.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.545
- Todd's just gonna
have to wait a minute.

08:00.547 --> 08:01.880
- Todd isn't waiting
for anything.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.616
Get in the conference now.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.652
- What is going on around here?

08:14.561 --> 08:18.263
- Peko Instruments, Nondo
Cellular, Melville Lumber.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.266
What's this all have
in common, Ryan?

08:21.268 --> 08:23.168
- They're all deals
that my team has done

08:23.170 --> 08:24.102
in the last few months.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.570
What's the problem?

08:25.572 --> 08:27.138
- Yeah, those are
deals your team did

08:27.140 --> 08:29.808
in Long Island outside
of your territory.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.177
You stole the accounts.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.746
- Marty, nobody stole anything.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.881
Okay?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.849
- Explain yourself, Ryan.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.751
- What did Jay have
to say about all this?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.254
- Let's get him in here.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.656
Tell Jay to get in here.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.198
- Jay, would you help
me out here, please?

08:53.200 --> 08:57.936
Explain to Mister English that
all of our deals are good.

08:59.239 --> 09:03.808
- Mister English, all
of our deals are good.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.110
- That's nice.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.012
You know it's bad enough
the economy stinks

09:07.014 --> 09:08.313
and we gotta lay people off,

09:08.315 --> 09:10.849
and we got salesmen out
there just sucking wind,

09:10.851 --> 09:12.817
and we cannot put
a team together,

09:12.819 --> 09:16.988
but you have to assemble
a bunch of thieves.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.992
- Ryan, if you can't offer
me a reasonable explanation

09:20.994 --> 09:23.194
for this then my hands are tied

09:23.997 --> 09:26.565
- Marty, you know as well,

09:26.567 --> 09:29.568
sometimes things
get shuffled around,

09:29.570 --> 09:32.203
but we always do
the right thing.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.239
So all the sudden
you're gonna come at me

09:34.241 --> 09:36.975
and like tell me that
this is a problem?

09:36.977 --> 09:38.944
- You signed the paperwork.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.980
You gave the blessing on
all of these accounts.

09:41.982 --> 09:45.050
You got Jay Greer with
nine of these last quarter.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.052
15 last quarter before that.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.120
You got 16 from Tony Vespa.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.923
21 from the Marino brothers.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.625
En route to number
one in the country.

09:53.627 --> 09:56.027
There's a little pattern here.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.362
A little thievery pattern.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.165
It's your team and
it's your signature

10:00.167 --> 10:03.101
and it's your job on the line.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.235
- ROSE: How quickly sometimes

10:04.237 --> 10:06.605
the course of our lives change.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.373
Little did Ryan know this
was just the beginning

10:08.375 --> 10:10.275
of a very rough road for him.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.743
- I've been with this
company a long time

10:11.745 --> 10:15.380
I made you millions
of dollars, okay.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.750
I've given you
everything I have.

10:18.752 --> 10:19.851
- You're fired.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.988
- Whoa, Marty.

10:24.758 --> 10:28.226
You can't fire the best
manager in the entire office.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.628
- Just did.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.763
Why don't you get
up and get lost?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.001
- Yes sir.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.702
- TODD: Ryan, go
wait by my office.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.842
- Is this really happening?

10:43.844 --> 10:46.378
- We have a pamphlet
if you like.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.246
- Todd, a pamphlet?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.182
- It's not your fault.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.917
It had to be done.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.419
Someone had to take the fall.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.389
- I know it's not
my fault but me?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.692
I'm taking this very personally.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.328
In fact, I'm thinking of coming
over that desk right now.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.330
- Do you want me
to call security?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.666
That the way you
want this to go?

11:07.668 --> 11:09.200
Listen, you'll be alright, Ryan.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.436
You'll land on your feet.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.939
- What happened to you?

11:14.941 --> 11:16.074
You're like a Judas.

11:17.678 --> 11:22.013
I put this company before my
family for the last 26 years.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.448
- We have counselors available

11:23.450 --> 11:27.886
if you feel like you
need to talk to somebody.

11:28.922 --> 11:29.988
- That's it?

11:30.824 --> 11:31.890
- That's it.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.766
- Hey Ryan.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.437
You'll be fine.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.944
- I'll be fine.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.051
(ALARM BUZZING)

12:07.761 --> 12:10.495
- ROSE: He felt such
disappointment and anger,

12:10.497 --> 12:13.898
but chose not to share his
struggles with his wife.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.402
It was never his way to open
up and show his vulnerability.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.471
He needed to let us help him.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.940
To let us into his heart.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.035
- Hi Grace.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.237
It's Judy Flomer.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.204
- Hi Judy.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.372
How are you?

12:54.374 --> 12:55.807
- I'm fine.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.776
I just wanted to
see how everyone is.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.111
How's Ryan holding up?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.312
- We're doing great.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.314
Everything's great around here.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.382
Kids are great.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.850
Ryan's great.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.453
- Where is he now?

13:08.455 --> 13:09.788
- He's at work.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.956
- He got a new job already?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.324
That's great news.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.026
- You didn't pour my coffee?

13:15.028 --> 13:16.461
- I'm on the phone.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.197
- What are you talking about?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.799
Got a new job?

13:20.801 --> 13:24.936
No, he's been working at
the office like everyday.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.971
- You don't know?

13:26.973 --> 13:28.039
Oh.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.011
Todd fired Ryan three days ago.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.078
I assumed you knew.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.180
I'm so sorry.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.882
- I'm so confused.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.251
He didn't mention
anything to me.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.253
- I'm so sorry.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.956
If there's anything I can do?

13:44.958 --> 13:46.124
- Thank you.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.025
Bye.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.018
Hi honey.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.353
- Hey babe.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.188
- How was work today?

14:18.458 --> 14:19.958
- Good.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.192
Great.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.894
- What did you do at work?

14:22.896 --> 14:23.995
- Same ole, same ole.

14:23.997 --> 14:24.629
Why?

14:24.631 --> 14:29.500
- Judy Flomer called me
asking how I was holding up.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.936
I didn't know what she meant

14:33.073 --> 14:37.876
until she told me her
husband fired you on Monday.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.143
You've been putting on that suit

14:39.145 --> 14:42.547
and going to work
for three days now.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.151
- I didn't know how to tell you.

14:47.153 --> 14:50.054
- I find out that not
only you're out of a job,

14:50.056 --> 14:53.191
but you're keeping
secrets from me.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.595
- That's not what
this was about.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.518
- ROSE: Ryan's life was
spiraling out of control

15:20.520 --> 15:23.955
and strain was being
placed on his marriage.

15:23.957 --> 15:28.159
The one person he needed
most was drifting away.

15:49.115 --> 15:49.948
- Hey Ry.

15:49.950 --> 15:50.682
How's it going, man?

15:50.684 --> 15:52.216
- Look at you.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.686
Still going for a run
even in this weather.

15:54.688 --> 15:57.155
- Hey, you know you
gotta stay fit, right?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.489
- Tell me about it.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.457
- So what's going on?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.126
You took off of work today?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.728
- They let me go.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.496
- Get out of here!

16:05.498 --> 16:06.998
You worked down
there far too long.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.566
- So much for loyalty.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.269
- So what are you gonna do now?

16:12.305 --> 16:15.106
- I'll think of something.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.240
- Amen.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.241
Good seeing you.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.977
- RYAN: You too.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.387
- Mommy, how do
you play checkers?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.055
- You don't know how to play?

16:31.057 --> 16:31.756
- No.

Now as we mentioned earlier--

16:39.766 --> 16:41.699
- Daddy, come and play.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.334
- I'm busy, honey.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.604
- Come on, Dad.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.042
- Kids, go upstairs, please.

16:52.078 --> 16:52.610
Please.

16:52.612 --> 16:56.614
- MAN: Most people have
been expecting this figure.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.151
It's just the economy
has gone one way.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.222
- You could make an effort.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.127
Get some rest.

17:10.230 --> 17:14.799
You're driving Chris
back to school tomorrow.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.101
- ROSE: Ryan felt such regret.

17:17.103 --> 17:22.140
His children once adored him
but now they were so distant.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.041
He was no longer their light.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.078
He did not know how
to connect with them.

17:27.079 --> 17:31.315
Their love and admiration
seemed a distance memory.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.724
- You okay, son?

17:42.595 --> 17:44.328
- Just fine, thanks.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.765
- You could've fooled me.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.100
I don't understand.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.769
- ROSE: I wished he had
never gotten that call.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.205
That place was a den of vipers.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.374
The callous, cutthroat
corporate world was no place

18:30.376 --> 18:32.343
for his gentle soul.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.344
- Okay, right.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.647
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.715
Thanks.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.789
- Who was that?

18:45.692 --> 18:46.791
- Jay.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.228
They want me to
come back to work.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.463
They wanna see me in
the office tomorrow.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.232
- That's good news.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.767
- Maybe it's not
such great news.

18:56.769 --> 18:59.303
I've been demoted to sales.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.408
- Honey, that is still good.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.343
It's a job.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.180

19:09.182 --> 19:10.815
I'll talk to you in a second.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.550
Take care.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.451
- Oh!

19:16.689 --> 19:17.755
Woo!

19:18.858 --> 19:19.757
- Another one.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.759

19:29.836 --> 19:30.735
Thanks a lot.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.170
Got one.

- Hello?

19:33.439 --> 19:34.372

19:35.542 --> 19:39.377

an outstanding product

You closed them?

Mister Perfection.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.559
No see, let's be serious.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.460
Exactly.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.431
- RYAN: Don't
worry, sweetheart.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.267
The more you do,
the easier it gets.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.002

It's all about teamwork, guys.

how many appointments?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.333

21:42.335 --> 21:46.537
From manager to cubicle,
what's that like?

21:46.539 --> 21:49.340
- I tell you, Tony, it's
kind of hard to remember.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.308
- You better start remembering.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.076
You gotta make sales.

- ROSE: The devil
has many faces

21:54.981 --> 21:56.981

you when you're down.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.449
- Good luck, Ryan.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.884
- ROSE: The last
thing Ryan needed

21:59.886 --> 22:02.053
at this point in his
life was temptation.

- You think now we
can get that drink?

22:05.758 --> 22:07.491
- Maybe, Trace.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.593
I'll let you know.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.501
- Good to have you back, man.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.736
- Thanks.

22:18.738 --> 22:23.607
- Listen, I was in Todd's
office for 45 minutes.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.409
He almost fired me, too.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.044
- Thank you for trying.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.647
You've always looked out for me.

order two more please?

22:53.005 --> 22:54.438

22:54.440 --> 22:58.376
- And I think we're
okay on everything else.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.644
And did you order those
samples for the lab?

23:00.646 --> 23:02.046

23:02.048 --> 23:03.781
They said that they would
come back in about two weeks.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.649

23:06.886 --> 23:09.954

to look at Rose's file?

23:09.956 --> 23:11.756
- I did, yes.

23:11.758 --> 23:12.656
- And?

23:14.961 --> 23:16.694
- You had a look at
the chart, right?

23:16.696 --> 23:18.429
- I did but I felt
like you might be able

23:18.431 --> 23:21.399
to see something that
no one else has seen.

23:21.401 --> 23:24.535
- Well you saw that the cancer
has spread to her brain,

23:24.537 --> 23:28.572
her stomach, her lungs, and
now it's in her lymph nodes.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.441
Unfortunately there's
nothing we can do.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.576
I give her maybe a few weeks.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.711
Maybe a month.

23:33.713 --> 23:34.478
- Weeks?

23:35.948 --> 23:38.749
There isn't any trials or
anything that you can put her in?

23:38.751 --> 23:39.884
Anything at all?

23:39.886 --> 23:41.085
- It's too late.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.620
There's no alternative
treatments?

23:42.622 --> 23:44.422
She's done.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.156
Sorry.

23:46.159 --> 23:47.958
- Are you sure?

23:47.960 --> 23:50.628
- Maybe if she came
a little sooner.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.030
I don't understand what
your fascination is

23:53.032 --> 23:54.498
with this patient.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.767
You seem to be taking
this very hard.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.035
- I'm friends with her son

23:58.037 --> 24:00.905
and he's best friends
with my husband.

24:00.907 --> 24:05.443
She's been my spiritual
inspiration for a very long time.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.944
- The next thing to do would be

24:06.946 --> 24:08.646
to look into hospice
care to make--

24:08.648 --> 24:09.880
- No, no hospice.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.582
I've been taking care
of her this whole time

24:11.584 --> 24:13.884
and I'm gonna continue
taking care of her.

24:13.886 --> 24:16.554
I think she would want that.

24:18.191 --> 24:21.592
- Well, I know you're
a woman of faith,

24:21.594 --> 24:25.463
so I hope that can
be of comfort to you.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.698
- I think God will provide.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.644
- Are you telling, Ryan?

24:43.182 --> 24:44.432
- Uh uh.

24:44.433 --> 24:45.683
I want nothing to do with that.

24:46.752 --> 24:50.054
You should stay out of it, too.

24:50.056 --> 24:52.923
Just email Ryan's
dad the results.

24:52.925 --> 24:53.824
- Okay.

24:55.628 --> 24:58.662
Are you going to church Sunday?

25:00.600 --> 25:03.601
- I've got a big
presentation at the office.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.803
- The kids would love
to see you though.

25:05.805 --> 25:06.604
- I know.

25:06.606 --> 25:12.176
The kids would also like to
go on vacation more too right?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.044
You hold down the
fort at church.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.146
I'll keep making money.

25:19.719 --> 25:20.651
Gotta go.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.689
- It's gonna be
great this weekend.

25:25.691 --> 25:26.891
- I can't wait.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.726
- What'd you tell your wife?

25:28.728 --> 25:29.844
- Who cares?

25:29.845 --> 25:30.961
She doesn't listen to me.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.696
She listens to God.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.132
She thinks he's a
better husband than me.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.600
- Apparently.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.838
- Let's see.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.839
Here we go.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.541
- ROSE: I tried to be strong.

25:43.543 --> 25:47.244
I didn't want my family to know
just how sick I really was.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.979
I was the heart of this family.

25:48.981 --> 25:54.184
Any pain or sadness I felt, I
kept it locked inside of me.

25:54.820 --> 25:55.753
- GIRL: Stings.

25:58.558 --> 26:01.959
- And then the
honeybee says oh no.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.627
I'm a honeybee.

26:03.629 --> 26:07.965
I pollinate plants that make
fruits, vegetables, and nuts.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.900
And the little girl says.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.802
- But don't you sting?

26:13.272 --> 26:15.239
- Man, look at him go.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.240
- It's amazing right?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.241
- He's unbelievable.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.209
I don't know how he does it.

26:19.211 --> 26:22.846
- ROSE: The boys
admired their dad.

26:22.848 --> 26:26.250
He was always calm and
thoughtful with them.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.019
He had a knack for saying
the right thing to the boys

26:29.021 --> 26:30.721
while never passing judgment

26:30.723 --> 26:33.624
or uttering a
hurtful word to them.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.893
I sensed that Ryan saw
him as a role model

26:35.895 --> 26:38.996
that he himself never
quite lived up to.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.097
- How you guys doing?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.600
- Everything's great, pop.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.735
- What about you, Ryan?

26:45.871 --> 26:47.605
- Doing okay.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.340
- I don't think so.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.775
- ROSE: A continuing
circle of light.

26:51.777 --> 26:55.279
- Could I have a
word with you please?

26:56.816 --> 26:57.815
- Sure Pop.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.319
- Tim, excuse us, okay?

27:02.321 --> 27:04.021
- You got it, Dad.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.857
- It's not as bad as you think.

27:09.629 --> 27:14.365
- I never had to deal with
anything like this in my life.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.868
It's like everything
is piling up.

27:18.904 --> 27:19.937
- Hi Grandpa.

27:19.939 --> 27:20.838
- Hi baby.

27:26.912 --> 27:30.414
- It's like they don't
even talk to me anymore.

27:30.416 --> 27:34.918
- They're of the age
of independence of you.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.420
It's the way life goes.

27:36.422 --> 27:42.993
- Still for me it's like
everything's happening all at once.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.065
It's like I can't even
breathe, you know.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.900
Like I'm suffocating.

27:51.404 --> 27:54.972
- Ryan, consider
yourself lucky, okay?

27:56.275 --> 27:59.677
You're gonna be noticing people

27:59.679 --> 28:03.047
falling on the right
and left of you.

28:03.049 --> 28:07.351
Friends of yours are
gonna be seeking divorces.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.824
- That's easy for you to say.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.293
You and mom have
been rock solid.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.361
- Yes.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.063
Yes.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.766
Times were easier then, Ryan.

28:23.836 --> 28:27.938
A long time ago my grandpa
gave me this thing.

28:30.810 --> 28:31.775
Look.

28:31.777 --> 28:34.712
I was about 10, 12 years old.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.747
And now it's a stone.

a current of a river,

28:45.391 --> 28:47.291
and that's how we face life.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.426
We try to absorb, look.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.730
I'm gonna give this to you

28:52.732 --> 28:55.899
'cause you're rough
like a rock now.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.234
Like a rock.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.769
But you won't get by that way.

28:58.771 --> 29:02.005
You have to embrace
life, get smooth.

29:02.007 --> 29:03.974
Breathe a little bit.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.809
You can do it.

29:05.811 --> 29:08.879
You don't wanna
remain a rock, do you?

29:08.881 --> 29:11.315
No, no.

Call it.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.193
- Three, two, one.

30:02.468 --> 30:03.934
- One second.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.980

million of these.

31:31.156 --> 31:32.422
He just looks like him.

for you boys.

Prayer has nothing to do with it

37:20.472 --> 37:21.404
- Let's go guys.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.572
- See you later.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.241
- See you later.

37:31.550 --> 37:35.552
So, what's going on in
that office is just,

37:35.554 --> 37:38.555
it doesn't compare to
what you've already got,

37:38.557 --> 37:39.823
what you've achieved.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.325
What you've achieved is
this wonderful family

37:42.327 --> 37:44.661
and you have to protect that.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.963
They just don't deserve.

37:46.965 --> 37:52.035
They don't deserve for you to
come home unhappy like that.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.373
I mean the people
in that office,

37:56.375 --> 37:59.509
they're meaningless
in the long run.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.711
They're not important.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.313
Your family is your security

38:03.315 --> 38:06.483
and you have to
make them secure.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.551
That's your job.

38:09.554 --> 38:10.487
Your home.

38:13.525 --> 38:16.510
That's your castle.

38:16.511 --> 38:19.496
The children, you know they
need to see you strong.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.732
You're their leader.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.701
- RYAN: I sure don't
feel like the leader.

38:24.703 --> 38:25.869
- You are, hun.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.070
You are.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.471
You're their leader.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.306
You're strong.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.508
You know what you are?

38:31.510 --> 38:33.343
You're like a palm tree.

38:33.345 --> 38:37.781
You know the palm tree
when there's a hurricane

38:37.783 --> 38:39.983
and it blows it all the way over

38:39.985 --> 38:44.054
and it goes to the ground
but it never cracks.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.457
It comes right up again,

38:47.459 --> 38:51.428
and the stress actually
makes it stronger.

38:56.335 --> 38:57.801
- Grace is pretty upset, huh?

38:57.803 --> 38:59.936
- Yes, she's very upset.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.405
She's a love.

39:03.508 --> 39:07.110
She takes such good care
of you and those children.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.045
You're so lucky to have them.

39:09.047 --> 39:12.048
I love every one of
them like I love you.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.818
I just don't want this
whole thing in that office

39:14.820 --> 39:16.953
to upset what you have.

39:21.693 --> 39:22.792
- Warm enough?

39:22.794 --> 39:23.893
- Yeah I'm fine.

- RYAN: What are
you doing out here?

01:03:58.368 --> 01:03:59.835
- Throwing apples against trees.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:01.236
- Seems a little bit strange.

01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:03.839
You standing out here doing
that in the middle of nowhere.

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.973
- No, it's not strange at all.

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.058
You know what?

01:04:06.059 --> 01:04:07.142
It's a great way for me to deal

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:09.377

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:20.989
- BOSS: Nice.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.124
- Does feel good.

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:24.092
- See that?

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:26.461
Work can be very stressful.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.599
- You're right.

01:04:30.601 --> 01:04:32.400
I have been under a
lot of stress lately.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:33.869
I don't know if you heard,

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:36.605
but my mom's been
sick with cancer.

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:39.074
- Sorry I didn't know that.

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:42.110
- Yeah, thanks.

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:47.616
- Go home, Ryan.

01:04:47.618 --> 01:04:49.284
Be there for your mom.

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:50.185
- Thanks.

01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:51.653
Appreciate that.

01:05:40.938 --> 01:05:42.404
- Yeah, can you believe it?

01:05:42.406 --> 01:05:43.939
- Aw man, that's horrible.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.607
Can I give you a hand with that?

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:46.541
- Oh, that's alright.

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.009
I got it, buddy.

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.945
- Aw man, you're
dressed too nice, man.

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:52.080
Here let me get this.

you don't mind?

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:55.583
No worries.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:58.019
It'll take five
minutes at the most.

01:05:58.021 --> 01:05:59.120
- That's awful nice of you.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.189
Could I give you a few dollars?

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:01.957
- No thank you, sir.

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:02.724
I'm blessed already.

01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:04.659
Thank you so much.

01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:06.561

- Right now I'm kind
of having a tough time.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:05.620
- You know Ryan, my brother.

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:08.023
I always had you pegged
for being a writer.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:09.491
I remember back in the old days

01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:11.159
when we were in school
in English class,

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:14.629
you used to write these
fascinating stories.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:18.466
Stories that most
people wouldn't believe.

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:22.137
I don't know if they were true,
or you were making them up,

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:27.075
but if I was you, I would
seriously, seriously consider

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:31.312
getting back into
being a writer.

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:34.282
You my friend
should be a writer.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:43.725
- So I see you're a bit
of a spiritual person.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:45.293
- How'd you know?

01:07:48.298 --> 01:07:49.230
Yes, I am.

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:54.335
- My sister in-law's
big into God.

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:55.770
- Oh, smart girl.

01:07:56.807 --> 01:07:59.307
- Well, sometimes
she gets a little

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:01.276
too preachy with everyone.

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:06.247
- Would you prefer that
she keep it all to herself?

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.849
- Yeah sometimes.

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:11.586
- Sometimes it just
comes pouring out.

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:13.788
- It's funny you say that.

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:15.857
I just ran into an old friend

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.359
I hadn't seen in about 20 years

01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:20.828
and he says just the
slightest little thing to me

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:23.698
and it's like a light went off.

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.701
- What did he tell you?

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:32.273
- It's crazy 'cause things
haven't been going my way lately.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:37.812
Facing a lot of challenges.

01:08:39.683 --> 01:08:43.751
But through a bit of an
odd sequence of events,

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:45.854
he shares with me that he thinks

01:08:45.856 --> 01:08:48.490
I should be doing some writing

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:53.461
and because of this one
in a million coincidence

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:57.265
of running into him, he
shares something with me

01:08:57.267 --> 01:09:00.734
that well it's really
got me thinking.

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:05.607
- There is no coincidence, Ryan.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:10.345
Coincidence is just God's
way of remaining anonymous.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:18.819
- ROSE: Ryan had an epiphany.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:21.756
Things suddenly
began to make sense.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:24.292
God had filled his
heart and his mind

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:29.264
and as he took pen to hand,
he and the Almighty co-wrote

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:33.334
the story of his struggles
and his redemption.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:45.412
- WOMAN: You look
beautiful, Rose.

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:46.915
- So sweet.

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:49.450
You're each other's strength.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:50.417
We all are.

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:06.901
- RYAN: I'm really
scared right now.

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:09.404
- Don't be scared.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.839
Don't be scared.

01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:15.610
I don't want you to be scared.

01:10:15.612 --> 01:10:18.279
It's a natural part of life.

01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:21.216
I'm okay with it.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:23.985
- RYAN: I'm not okay with it.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.774
- Promise me.

01:10:29.775 --> 01:10:31.258
Promise me that you're
going to be happy

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:34.996
and you're gonna take
care of your family.

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:40.268
I can't promise I'm gonna get
well but I know one thing.

01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:45.873
I will never leave you.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:49.377
I'll always be in
that heart of yours.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:54.782
Do you believe me?

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:56.251
I will.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:59.921
I'll stay right there,
crawling right in there.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:01.256
I love you very much.

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:02.657
You've been a wonderful son.

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:04.392
I'm proud of you.

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:07.395
I'm proud of you.

01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:10.832
Give me a hug.

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:12.333
I need a hug.

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:24.479
That's my boy.

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.847
That's my son.

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:26.981
I love you.

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:29.484
I'm proud of you.

01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:30.018
- Love you.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.653
- ROSE: Love you.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:39.327
- IAN: Could you stay
a little bit longer?

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:39.927
Please.

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:41.629
- ROSE: I hope so.

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:46.668
At that moment, Ian seemed more

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:50.305
and more distant at
every passing moment.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:53.374
His words could no
longer reach my ears

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:57.979
and I suddenly felt I was
in the presence of angels.

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:02.050
I knew my mom and dad
were now near to me.

01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:05.987
I could feel them, sense
them, remember them.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:07.989
Almost touch them.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:11.092
They were waiting
to take my hand.

01:12:35.552 --> 01:12:36.684
- She's gone.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:39.954
I'm sorry.

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.678
Gladys, she's gone.

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:11.586
Rose is gone.

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:21.596
- She can finally rest now.

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:22.697
She's at peace.

01:13:24.868 --> 01:13:25.800
- Thanks.

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:32.673
I thought she was gonna be
here a little bit longer.

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:34.008
Just a little.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:38.579
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:44.152
- ROSE: Thank you, sweetie,
for how you cared for me.

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:46.954
You looked at me as
your inspiration,

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:49.424
but you were actually mine.

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:52.427
You showed me that no
matter how bleak things are,

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:54.762
God never leaves our side.

01:13:58.067 --> 01:14:01.035
- I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:03.504
- It'll be okay.

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:06.707
God has a plan for all of us.

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:10.178
Just have faith.

- So I guess this is the
end of the road for mom.

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:15.710
For some that may be true.

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:20.081
But in honor of her
I stand here today

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:22.650
in disagreement with that idea.

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:27.255
It is through her
example of love and life

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.225
that I have been blessed
with the understanding

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:33.261
of what matters most.

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:38.599
You see mom was a
person of faith.

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:41.702
With faith comes hope.

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.539
If you don't have
hope in this life,

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:48.543
well then you can
never truly be happy.

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:53.281
So the past year has been,
well it's been a living hell.

01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:58.553
My own kids became
strangers to me.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:01.756
I watched my wife
drift away from me.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:05.893
I lost that powerful
position at my job.

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:08.095
A position that I
allowed to become

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:10.831
the very thing that defined me.

01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:16.103
I arrived at a place in my life

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:19.774
that had become
meaningless or hopeless,

01:16:22.312 --> 01:16:26.847
but then one night God
started weaving together

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:30.785
a sequence of events
that would lead me

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:34.322
to an understanding of
what I needed to do.

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:39.660
You see, even though
I thought I was lost,

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:46.601
God was with me the whole
time weaving together a fabric

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:52.740
that would lead me to a place
where I knew what I had to do.

01:16:53.176 --> 01:16:54.709
And I did it.

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:57.378
So thanks to mom, to you Dad.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.615
To my wife, Grace.

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.352
My beautiful kids.

01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:06.621
My friends, my family.

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:11.926
I know in my heart
that this isn't the end

01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:16.864
and it isn't the
end for my mother.

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:20.334
I imagine that
somewhere she's running

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:22.670
through a field right now.

01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:24.939
And I say that she's running

01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:28.843
because now she has
been made perfect.

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:30.645
She's been healed.

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:35.716
Maybe she's sitting with her mom

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:40.821
telling her stories about
her beautiful grandkids

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:45.726
or the 60 wonderful years
she spent with her husband.

01:17:47.864 --> 01:17:48.863
It's true, Dad.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:51.732
Mom could be up in
heaven right now

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:55.269
saying nothing but
nice things about you.

01:17:56.406 --> 01:17:59.807
And we actually all have
the chance to go there, too,

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:03.310
but there's more for
us to do here first

01:18:04.747 --> 01:18:09.283
because God has a plan and a
purpose for all of our lives.

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:12.820
For you too, Dad, to be more

01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:16.691
of a blessing to
your grandchildren.

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:19.727
So don't give up, okay,
just because mom's gone.

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:22.463
We need you now more than ever.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.967
And I wanna thank
you for showing me

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:30.738
how to be a better
father and a husband.

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:33.974
There's so much
more to this life.

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:36.977
It all connects.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:41.782
There's no coincidence.

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:45.352
It's like a tapestry.

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:51.258
Like when you and mom, Dad,
went to that dance hall

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.927
so many years ago.

01:18:52.929 --> 01:18:56.430
So many other places you
could've gone that night,

01:18:56.432 --> 01:18:58.766
but it was meant to be.

01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:04.205
And I believe you and mom
are gonna be together again.

01:19:04.207 --> 01:19:05.106
One day.

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.843
This isn't the end.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.514
It's just the beginning.

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:16.450
Miss you.

01:19:19.956 --> 01:19:21.355
Love you a lot.

01:19:30.533 --> 01:19:31.999
- Knock, knock.

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:36.904
Can I have your autograph?

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.843
- Where did you get that?

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:45.379
- JAY: Bobby gave it to me.

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:47.548
- He shouldn't have done that.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:49.917
- If you really wrote this,

01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:53.187
you know you have
to have forgiveness.

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:57.892
- I don't have to
have anything, Jay.

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:00.194
- I'm sorry, bro.

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:02.563
- So what?

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:03.864
In your mind this is the moment

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:06.534
where I turn the other cheek?

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:11.338
- Look, I was wrong alright.

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.174
I was dealing with
my own problems

01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:16.977
and I mistook kindness
for something else.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:21.182
It's no excuse but I am sorry.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.085
- You mean that?

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.055
- I do.

01:20:28.057 --> 01:20:29.590
This spoke to me.

01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:35.963
- Hey Jay.

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:37.198
- What's up?

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.901
- So you know I've
forgiven you already,

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:44.104
but it doesn't mean I'm
gonna be inviting you over

01:20:44.106 --> 01:20:46.040
for steaks any time soon.

01:20:47.109 --> 01:20:48.576
- Be good, Ryan.

01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:00.054
- Hey.

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:00.955
- Hey.

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:03.457
- About the other night.

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:04.859
- Yeah.

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:06.927
About the other night.

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:12.266
- This is never gonna happen.

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:13.200
- What?

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:15.970
- Yeah.

01:21:16.973 --> 01:21:18.038

That's it?

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:21.575

01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:47.301
but inside there
was still emptiness

01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:51.538
as he worried about his dad
who was now even more distant

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:55.209
from God after losing
the love of his life,

01:21:56.178 --> 01:21:58.479
but miracles do happen.

01:21:58.481 --> 01:22:00.681

entered that church,

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:03.617
I don't know if I
was more proud of Ian

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:06.020
for the huge step he was taking

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:10.057
or of Ryan for leading
his dad back to God.

01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:16.063
- Ryan.

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:16.664
- Hey Pop.

01:22:16.666 --> 01:22:21.969
- Hey son, I really like what
you said at Mom's funeral,

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:27.007
especially being a blessing
for the grandchildren,

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:31.211

a little more faith.
