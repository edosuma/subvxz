00:16.710 --> 00:20.709
Alpha Team in position.

00:20.710 --> 00:24.819
One hostile at the
back door, over.

00:24.820 --> 00:29.059
Bravo Set - one single
guard at the front entrance.

00:29.060 --> 00:33.099
Delta Set - one guarding the
back door armed with a long gun.

00:33.100 --> 00:37.289
No night vision. Charlie
Set - roof is clear.

00:37.290 --> 00:41.629
Echo confirming one guarding the
front entrance. Roof is clear.

00:41.630 --> 00:45.749
Delta we move on your mark.
Call the Ball. Roger.

00:45.750 --> 00:49.949
Echo, you have the sentry guarding the front
door, I will take the one guarding the back.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.989
Charlie, continue overwatch
in case of any response.

00:53.990 --> 00:58.139
Confirm when ready. Set. Set.

00:58.140 --> 01:02.249
On my
mark..three... two...

01:02.250 --> 01:06.289
Target down. All clear.

01:06.290 --> 01:10.530
Alpha, Bravo, you are clear to move.
Move.

02:33.160 --> 02:37.359
We have a squirter Target down.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.560
Barnes!

02:49.900 --> 02:53.899
Alpha team clear.
Warehouse clear.

02:53.900 --> 02:58.019
Clear. Clear. All clear. Barnes!

02:58.020 --> 03:02.359
How is she? She's a little
dazed, but otherwise okay.

03:02.360 --> 03:06.429
I think she might be drugged too.
The DEA can come in now, it's clear.

03:06.430 --> 03:10.669
Let's see what these
bastards have been up to.

03:10.670 --> 03:15.069
Check that box.

03:15.070 --> 03:19.249
What the hell?

03:19.250 --> 03:23.629
Something's not right here.

03:23.630 --> 03:27.739
Is it just me, or does that wall
look a little out of place here?

03:27.740 --> 03:32.040
It's definitely hollow.

03:36.140 --> 03:40.150
What the hell?

03:48.420 --> 03:52.579
Alpha, there's a girl in here walking
toward us. Copy, we found some in here too

03:52.580 --> 03:56.619
checking it out. Hon?

03:56.620 --> 04:00.659
Are you okay?

04:00.660 --> 04:04.750
BOMB!

05:07.300 --> 05:11.599
Hi.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.669
Excuse me, um... I...

05:15.670 --> 05:19.869
I'm here for the interview...

05:19.870 --> 05:24.309
I didn't know this
company was a startup.

05:24.310 --> 05:28.499
Not that it
matters... I... love... a challenge.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.530
Please have a seat
and put these on.

05:45.230 --> 05:49.369
Ah ha ha... so cool...

05:49.370 --> 05:53.799
Is that what your company does?
Because... if...

05:53.800 --> 05:57.869
so, this is my peanut
butter and jam.

05:57.870 --> 06:01.989
I'm definitely on board.
Uh, and who is that dude.

06:01.990 --> 06:06.119
He is a man on a mission

06:06.120 --> 06:10.169
that must be the boss.
Good morning Mr Martin.

06:10.170 --> 06:14.489
I find it more convenient
to conduct my meetings

06:14.490 --> 06:18.529
this way. This won't take
much of your time. Or mine.

06:18.530 --> 06:22.579
Okay... I completely
understand... mister...

06:22.580 --> 06:26.909
Smith... you may call me Mr Smith.
Okay, Mr... uh... Smith.

06:26.910 --> 06:30.959
You're the one
conducting the interview?

06:30.960 --> 06:34.999
Quite frankly, this is not so much
of an interview as it is an offer.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.049
I get the job? Your brother is under investigation
by the securities and exchange commission.

06:39.050 --> 06:43.189
Yeah... you're with
the SEC... right?

06:43.190 --> 06:47.239
Yeah, okay then... this interview is
over until I can get my attorney.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.719
No, Mr Martin... I
am not with the SEC.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.949
May I continue? That securities and
exchange commission will find your brother

06:55.950 --> 07:00.329
guilty, of that there is no doubt.
He has been dealing with

07:00.330 --> 07:04.509
some extremely shady people.
As a result, your brother

07:04.510 --> 07:08.629
and his family are in for
some very difficult times...

07:08.630 --> 07:12.659
in the near and distant future. How did you...
This is where my offer to you comes in.

07:12.660 --> 07:16.899
Mr Martin, you possess

07:16.900 --> 07:21.309
a certain skill set. Skills
of which my organization

07:21.310 --> 07:25.449
is in need. You mean
my programming...

07:25.450 --> 07:29.749
Perhaps I should have said skills
possessed by your alter ego... Mimir.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.829
Mim... mi... no... no... Interesting
choice for a hackers pseudonym...

07:33.830 --> 07:38.039
Mimir... the Norse God of Wisdom.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.489
I do hope you possess
the wisdom of Mimir.

07:42.490 --> 07:46.659
As I said... you possess certain
skills that my organisation

07:46.660 --> 07:51.049
is in need of. If you accept
my offer, we will ensure that

07:51.050 --> 07:55.169
your brother's investigation with the
SEC will be concluded in his favor.

07:55.170 --> 07:59.179
I thought you said you
weren't with the SEC I'm not.

07:59.180 --> 08:03.619
I'm simply to effect the
influence of a great many things.

08:03.620 --> 08:07.809
Your brother's
investigation is one of them.

08:07.810 --> 08:11.959
Oh... kay... and...

08:11.960 --> 08:16.059
if I reject your offer?
As I said,

08:16.060 --> 08:20.069
your brother and his family will
be in for a very..hard... time...

08:20.070 --> 08:24.519
I get the bargain... I, uh...

08:24.520 --> 08:28.729
I become your
hacker slave and...

08:28.730 --> 08:33.078
you fix my brother and his

08:33.080 --> 08:37.219
family's problems. No, in fact, Mr
Martin, we will only require your services

08:37.220 --> 08:41.479
for this one assignment. After
that you may go back to your life

08:41.480 --> 08:45.969
hacking away, as normal,
except you will have

08:45.970 --> 08:50.219
a very large stipend as
compensation for your services.

08:50.220 --> 08:54.289
Ummm.

08:54.290 --> 08:58.299
How many laws would I have to break? Considering
the number of laws you've already broken,

08:58.300 --> 09:02.369
I wouldn't think that would
be a consideration for you.

09:02.370 --> 09:06.829
But, you will be doing a
service foryour country.

09:06.830 --> 09:10.889
Ah ha... okay... yeah... you're
with the government.

09:10.890 --> 09:15.269
No, I am not with the government... on
the contrary we provide

09:15.270 --> 09:19.359
extra-governmental oversight... preferring
to work outside the contraints

09:19.360 --> 09:23.419
of the political agendas of most countries...
opting to work for our own country

09:23.420 --> 09:27.849
and it's citizens.

09:27.850 --> 09:32.690
You needn't make a decision immediately. I'll give you the rest
of the day to think about my office. Tomorrow at precisely

09:32.714 --> 09:36.469
noon, you will receive a text.
We will expect your answer then.

09:36.470 --> 09:40.639
And do keep in mind, Mr Martin, we
will not make this offer a second time.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.670
Good day.

10:04.880 --> 10:09.229
He'll work... he's a much better
programmer than even he realizes.

10:09.230 --> 10:13.340
His hacking skills
are off the charts.

10:17.370 --> 10:21.839
There will be some growing
pains... for all of them.

10:21.840 --> 10:26.070
But in the end I'm positive he'll mesh
well for... whatever you have in mind.

10:34.320 --> 10:38.380
CLICK

11:16.090 --> 11:20.329
No... no... I
completely understand.

11:20.330 --> 11:24.770
Thank you for everything
you're doing for my father.

12:11.490 --> 12:15.529
According to this note,
you're the last one.

12:15.530 --> 12:19.599
Seven names... seven people.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.040
So... are you the one who's going to tell us what the hell
we're going here? None of these idiots know anything.

12:24.064 --> 12:27.949
All I know is...

12:27.950 --> 12:32.139
What I was told
during my interview...

12:32.140 --> 12:36.270
I'm just here for my hacking skills.

12:40.370 --> 12:44.679
Well, well... the
mysterious "Mr Smith".

12:44.680 --> 12:48.850
Again...

12:57.440 --> 13:01.440
My
Kind of meeting, right to the point>

13:13.940 --> 13:18.299
Well, you've certainly pulled
together quite an interesting group.

13:18.300 --> 13:22.379
Military... military.
Maybe police...

13:22.380 --> 13:26.659
Military... military...

13:26.660 --> 13:30.709
I'm going to guess you're
our token geek... And you...

13:30.710 --> 13:34.880
No clue... but you have a
very seedy look to you.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.309
We're all waiting to hear with baited
breath.

13:47.310 --> 13:51.439
Who's
rumored to be the next Republican

13:51.440 --> 13:55.550
candidate for President of
the United States.

13:59.640 --> 14:04.109
She's very active in the women's
right movement in the Middle East.

14:04.110 --> 14:08.149
She's been using her father's connections
to work with the Afghan government

14:08.150 --> 14:12.329
to build schools and provide education
for young Afghan girls. And it hasn't made

14:12.330 --> 14:16.429
her very propular with some very
nasty people from what I hear.

14:16.430 --> 14:20.699
You seem to know a lot about her.
The middle east is my specialty...

14:20.700 --> 14:24.750
I'm guessing that's why I'm here...

14:54.180 --> 14:58.249
How many dead?

14:58.250 --> 15:02.280
How did they
manage to keep that one quiet?

15:15.050 --> 15:19.109
Who claimed responsibility?

15:19.110 --> 15:23.340
Others?

15:35.860 --> 15:39.879
How is
someone "accidentally" rescued?

15:39.880 --> 15:43.889
Because, we didn't
know they were there.

15:43.890 --> 15:47.989
We were working with the
DEA... doing what we could

15:47.990 --> 15:52.009
to interrupt the flow of drugs coming
out of Afghanistan. We had a lead

15:52.010 --> 15:56.450
on a large of stash of high grade opiates supposedly being
stored in a warehouse... but instead of finding drugs

15:56.474 --> 16:00.544
we found five women chained to a wall.
Who is "we"?

16:04.350 --> 16:08.619
Captain Dale Swanson...

16:08.620 --> 16:13.109
currently assigned to first special
forces, operational detachment delta.

16:13.110 --> 16:17.329
This is a military operation? I
guess should have figured... with...

16:17.330 --> 16:21.810
looks of you guys... but I thought you said we weren't
going to be working with the government... I'm no leave...

16:21.834 --> 16:25.679
After the ...incident...

16:25.680 --> 16:29.999
at the warehouse, I was told
to take all the time I needed.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.009
Finding give women chained to a
wall effected you that much... No...

16:34.010 --> 16:38.029
It was the suicide bomber that took out half
of my team and the entire DEA contingent.

16:38.030 --> 16:42.109
Three days into my leave,
I was contacted by Mr Smith...

16:42.110 --> 16:46.160
I have a feeling you all know the
rest of the story.

16:50.350 --> 16:54.750
(you are to search for an rescue Miss Thurman,
and any other young ladies who might.

17:07.220 --> 17:11.400
TEXT TONES

17:19.930 --> 17:23.959
Yeah... wait... uh...

17:23.960 --> 17:28.029
Do you want me to use my own computer
equipment or is there something

17:28.030 --> 17:32.179
that you'd like me to use?

17:32.180 --> 17:36.479
I guess he meant that literally.

17:36.480 --> 17:40.589
Okay... first thing I'd like to
do is figure out who we are...

17:40.590 --> 17:44.859
what we can do... what
we can't do...

17:44.860 --> 17:49.329
I'm not used to working with a team I don't
know. That's as good a place to start as any.

17:49.330 --> 17:53.559
I'm Julian... but only my
mother calls me Julian...

17:53.560 --> 17:57.609
Everyone who knows
me calls me Jules...

17:57.610 --> 18:01.679
and I've a feeling before this is
over we'll know each other quite well.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.699
You were pretty
spot on... Miss...

18:05.700 --> 18:10.139
Ankita. Ankita...

18:10.140 --> 18:14.339
A lot of people refer to
my profession as "seedy"

18:14.340 --> 18:18.689
I tend to move around in the
dark underbelly of society

18:18.690 --> 18:22.789
I'm in the business of finding and
procuring anything my customer needs

18:22.790 --> 18:27.099
by any means... whether
they be legal

18:27.100 --> 18:31.559
or illicit... Black marketeer... I can
definitely see the benefits of you on our team.

18:31.560 --> 18:35.759
My specialty includes profiling

18:35.760 --> 18:40.179
and deprogramming. I'm guessing I'm here
in case Miss Thurman needs deprogramming

18:40.180 --> 18:44.229
after the ordeal. FBI?

18:44.230 --> 18:48.559
At one point... let's
leave it at that.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.639
Well, what do you think?

18:52.640 --> 18:56.859
I think you've put together
a good group of individuals.

18:56.860 --> 19:01.259
Let's see if they can operate as a team.
You know the history some of them have.

19:01.260 --> 19:05.449
We have Lilah to thank for bringing
them here. Another good choice.

19:05.450 --> 19:09.839
Now we have to see if Captain Swanson
can bring them together as a team.

19:09.840 --> 19:13.929
There's the question mark.

19:13.930 --> 19:18.209
The incident in Ankara hit him pretty hard.
Hopefully it doesn't effect his leadership

19:18.210 --> 19:22.259
of this team. We can't afford
for him to be overly cautious.

19:22.260 --> 19:26.429
My real concern is Larry.

19:26.430 --> 19:30.779
We've created a pack of Alpha Wolves
and tossed a sheep in their midst.

19:30.780 --> 19:34.899
I just hope he doesn't get eaten
alive before this is all over.

19:34.900 --> 19:39.200
Time will tell.

19:43.210 --> 19:47.419
Folami... I'm an engineer.

19:47.420 --> 19:51.479
But I cut my teeth in
the Legion Etrangere.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.539
The French Foreign Legion.

19:55.540 --> 19:59.739
Koa... Royal Thai Army... Special
Warfare Division.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.979
But you're not Thai... Laotian?
Yes...

20:03.980 --> 20:08.129
My father worked with the American
CIA during the Vietnamese War.

20:08.130 --> 20:12.410
When the American forces left the country, they left
him. So he fled, taking all of us to Thailand with him.

20:12.434 --> 20:16.689
I'm going to guess
"Ivan" over here

20:16.690 --> 20:20.969
is also Spec
Ops... probably Spetznaz

20:20.970 --> 20:25.489
Alexi... yes... before...

20:25.490 --> 20:29.499
when I was young and stupid.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.869
Now I work as chief of security for
a Russian businessman in Moscow.

20:33.870 --> 20:38.009
So you're an enforcer
for the Russian Mafia.

20:38.010 --> 20:42.169
Da... I knew you looked
familiar... I've done some work

20:42.170 --> 20:46.439
for your boss on occasion.

20:46.440 --> 20:50.629
I think my main reason for being here is to
soften the testosterone level of the group.

20:50.630 --> 20:55.009
No... that's probably me.

20:55.010 --> 20:59.159
My specialty is the middle eastern affairs
with a focus on fundamentalist terrorism.

20:59.160 --> 21:03.210
Formerly with the RAW, now I work in
the private sector. So you're a spook!

21:07.420 --> 21:11.619
Watch out... she'll
take your teeth.

21:11.620 --> 21:16.039
And... I'm your IT guy.

21:16.040 --> 21:20.099
IT guy... well specs... it's
time to earn your money.

21:20.100 --> 21:24.160
That goes for all of you... enough chit
chat... let's find this girl for the boss.

21:35.260 --> 21:39.589
If you so much as move.

21:39.590 --> 21:43.659
You'll end up with a Russian
Bowtie.

21:43.660 --> 21:47.929
Anyone curious enough to know
who he is, or should I just-

21:47.930 --> 21:52.209
Whoa...

21:52.210 --> 21:56.239
Let's not get crazy.

21:56.240 --> 22:00.589
Now I AM curious. I'm just delivering
the supplies you requested.

22:00.590 --> 22:04.670
You don't look much
like a delivery boy.

22:08.870 --> 22:13.069
Curiouser and curiouser.

22:13.070 --> 22:17.219
Start talking. I'm Clark...

22:17.220 --> 22:21.239
your handler... your contact... it's
my number that's on your phone.

22:21.240 --> 22:25.729
Why the hell you sneaking around
in the middle of the night?

22:25.730 --> 22:29.979
This lot needs
their beauty sleep.

22:29.980 --> 22:34.399
This isn't a nine-to-five... things
get done when they need to get done.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.449
Even if it does interfere
with your beauty rest.

22:38.450 --> 22:42.809
So, now that you're all awake you can
help me bring in the rest of the stuff.

22:42.810 --> 22:46.900
I got some extra
special toys for you.

22:50.900 --> 22:55.329
I bet computer.

22:55.330 --> 22:59.479
You need all of this?
Geek!

22:59.480 --> 23:03.899
For what it's worth,
thanks for all the gear.

23:03.900 --> 23:07.979
So what's inside this thing anyway. That case
you're carrying has the latest intelligence dump

23:07.980 --> 23:12.259
for the area. It'll give you a
good starting point in your search.

23:12.260 --> 23:16.749
We managed to narrow it down to just a few groups who might be
responsible. And I'll be able to contact you any time we need something.

23:16.750 --> 23:20.979
Using the number Smith sent us, correct?
You'll be able to contact me any time you want

23:20.980 --> 23:25.380
just by looking over and talking to me. I'll be with you
permanently... for the rest of the mission. Excuse me?

23:25.404 --> 23:29.289
I was under the impression I was going to have
full control of the team, not have someone staring

23:29.290 --> 23:33.609
over my shoulder
micromanaging the whole time.

23:33.610 --> 23:37.970
I'm simply a liaison. A resource for you and the rest of
the team. I'll be operating as a member of your team.

23:37.994 --> 23:41.869
You're in command. No need to
worry about me getting in the way.

23:41.870 --> 23:46.269
If nothing else, we can still
use him to keep Koa in line.

23:46.270 --> 23:50.339
Any more surprises?
That is all Captain.

23:50.340 --> 23:54.350
Then you're dismissed.

23:58.850 --> 24:02.909
This is some next generation

24:02.910 --> 24:07.099
shhhhh-stuff

24:07.100 --> 24:11.239
I had no idea this
gear even existed.

24:11.240 --> 24:15.589
The trade mags say
this is at least ten

24:15.590 --> 24:19.649
years away.

24:19.650 --> 24:23.679
We... are... IN.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.779
Haha... terrorist network hacked

24:27.780 --> 24:31.870
bucket list checked!

24:36.150 --> 24:40.600
You don't think this is going to put
me on some terrorist hit list do you?

24:44.810 --> 24:49.250
That would suck...

24:53.400 --> 24:57.499
So what's your take on Clark?

24:57.500 --> 25:01.519
He doesn't appear to be just
another corporate bean-counter type.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.579
There's more to that book than just the
cover... a lot more than he's telling us.

25:05.580 --> 25:09.869
Koa here is a force to be reckoned with and
Cark handled him as if he was a school boy.

25:09.870 --> 25:13.949
He caught me offguard.

25:13.950 --> 25:18.259
Amateur.

25:18.260 --> 25:22.789
My point exactly. I'd
love to hear his story.

25:22.790 --> 25:26.789
But I doubt we'll ever get it.

25:26.790 --> 25:30.919
They're doing well together so far.

25:30.920 --> 25:35.020
If the death of his team is weighing
on him, he isn't letting it show.

25:39.260 --> 25:43.380
And if he resists?

25:47.530 --> 25:51.850
Yes sir.

25:55.860 --> 25:59.889
There... what is that?

25:59.890 --> 26:04.349
Uh...

26:04.350 --> 26:08.399
Huh...

26:08.400 --> 26:12.439
It seems to be...

26:12.440 --> 26:16.469
Detailed files of every
girl they've kidnapped.

26:16.470 --> 26:20.499
Down to daily schedules... this
one... right there.

26:20.500 --> 26:24.559
We have Mary Templeton...

26:24.560 --> 26:29.029
She's a vegetarian... she goes
to the local farmers market

26:29.030 --> 26:33.049
every Saturday morning... wait...

26:33.050 --> 26:37.459
How many girls

26:37.460 --> 26:41.629
did they saw had
been kidnapped... 27?

26:41.630 --> 26:45.719
Swanson! Yeah...

26:45.720 --> 26:49.769
OH, yeah... I've-i've discovered
a local server that the.

26:49.770 --> 26:53.999
Islamic State is using and I was
able to hack into it and found-

26:54.000 --> 26:58.479
What am I looking at? It appears to
be detailed files of thirty young

26:58.480 --> 27:02.519
women... 27 of whom have
already been kidnapped.

27:02.520 --> 27:06.589
You're telling me we have a list of women
they're still planning to kidnap. Possibly.

27:06.590 --> 27:11.040
Any clue on a timeline
or who's next even?

27:15.300 --> 27:19.799
Uh... Look... I thin
we've hit a lucky break.

27:19.800 --> 27:23.869
Someone's put out a call for bids... someone wants
to place an order for a large quantity of C-4.

27:23.870 --> 27:27.879
Okay... follow up on that. Print out that
list for me and dig deeper into the server.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.960
The rest of you guys over here... we
got a plan to work out... Pronto.

27:36.160 --> 27:40.579
How the hell did Smith

27:40.580 --> 27:44.769
get ahold of a Predator?

27:44.770 --> 27:49.120
Yeah... probably best we not
know how he does what he does.

28:12.220 --> 28:13.220
Out... out of the car!

28:13.221 --> 28:17.229
Out... out of the car!

28:17.230 --> 28:21.239
Out or we will kill
you where you sit and

28:21.240 --> 28:25.270
leave your body for the crows.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.319
(Electrical crackling)

28:37.320 --> 28:41.340
They're finally waking up.

28:45.360 --> 28:49.379
Glad to have you both join us again.
We're looking for some answers.

28:49.380 --> 28:53.390
Maybe you can help us and
I don't have a lot of time.

28:57.400 --> 29:01.410
Looking for this girl. Hey!
Looking for this girl!

29:05.430 --> 29:09.449
I need you to tell me
everything you know.

29:09.450 --> 29:13.479
Names... locations... tactical
data...

29:13.480 --> 29:17.489
I don't think you appreciate
the gravity of this situation.

29:17.490 --> 29:21.509
Either you give me
the answers I need

29:21.510 --> 29:25.630
and prove yourself useful or I'm going to put a bullet
in your head and dump your body over the bridge!!

29:25.654 --> 29:29.549
Does he speak English?
You won't do that.

29:29.550 --> 29:33.569
You are American military and
you have to follow the rules.

29:33.570 --> 29:37.579
Well, I'm not...

29:37.580 --> 29:41.589
Hey...

29:41.590 --> 29:45.609
I said I'D put a bullet in him.

29:45.610 --> 29:49.619
Now...

29:49.620 --> 29:53.649
are you going to be more useful?

29:53.650 --> 29:57.669
Or am I going to have see if
your buddies have more to say?

29:57.670 --> 30:01.679
The ones who are supposed to
be capturing the other girls?

30:01.680 --> 30:05.700
Yeah... that's good...

30:21.750 --> 30:25.770
Wait... did he just...

30:37.810 --> 30:41.849
This is definitely
quite a large order.

30:41.850 --> 30:45.869
In addition to the large quantity of
C-4 they're looking for burner phones

30:45.870 --> 30:49.889
and tactical
vests... detonators...

30:49.890 --> 30:53.899
someone's going to be making
a lot of bomb vests...

30:53.900 --> 30:57.899
from the numbers I'd
say... fifty or sixty of them.

30:57.900 --> 31:01.909
Well, it's not like they don't have
volunteers for a trip to paradise

31:01.910 --> 31:05.929
and their 72 virgins.

31:05.930 --> 31:09.949
Well, I placed a bid for
everything on the list.

31:09.950 --> 31:13.969
Purposely lowballed so I should
easily win the bid.

31:13.970 --> 31:17.969
See... that didn't take long.

31:17.970 --> 31:21.999
They've already accepted my
bid... given us delivery instructions.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.009
Let me see that.

31:26.010 --> 31:30.029
See what I can do to, uh

31:30.030 --> 31:34.039
to track that email down.

31:34.040 --> 31:38.050
Probably not likely they've used
anything we can track but you never know.

31:42.080 --> 31:46.119
Alright... uh...

31:46.120 --> 31:50.139
Uh, let me know if you

31:50.140 --> 31:54.159
uh... get anything else... uh... the
more information I get

31:54.160 --> 31:58.180
the better. Yeah... sure.

32:18.280 --> 32:22.309
It appears the car that left

32:22.310 --> 32:26.319
as we were arriving is the only one.
Nothing back here.

32:26.320 --> 32:30.330
No lights showing except the
one next to the back door.

32:34.350 --> 32:38.370
Deploying laser.

32:46.420 --> 32:50.430
Let's see if someone
comes out to check it.

34:14.770 --> 34:18.779
Three girls on the floor
near the bed. No bogies in sight.

34:18.780 --> 34:22.799
Too easy.

34:22.800 --> 34:26.820
Blow the door.

34:30.840 --> 34:34.859
Get off!

34:34.860 --> 34:38.879
Stop! Get off!

34:38.880 --> 34:42.889
Miss Thurman!
Rankin..in here... NOW!

34:42.889 --> 34:46.909
Miss Thurman, we're
here to help you.

34:50.920 --> 34:54.949
There really was
no other choice.

34:54.949 --> 34:58.959
What would we do with
them all afterward?

34:58.960 --> 35:02.979
We extracted the information we needed?
I don't know... turn them in?

35:02.980 --> 35:06.999
To who?? The local police?
The FBI? The military?

35:07.000 --> 35:11.029
How would we explain it to them?

35:11.030 --> 35:15.059
Exactly... you can't just show
up at the local police precinct

35:15.060 --> 35:19.089
and say, "Hi, I'm with a secret non-governmental
agency who's tracking terrorists..."

35:19.090 --> 35:23.099
"we killed a few of them, but
here's the ones we didn't."

35:23.100 --> 35:27.109
Yeah... I know... I get it...

35:27.110 --> 35:31.139
Doesn't make it any easier
though... I've never seen a dead body...

35:31.140 --> 35:35.159
I've never even been to a funeral, much
less watched someone killed in cold blood.

35:35.160 --> 35:39.189
Believe me, that was
not in cold blood.

35:39.190 --> 35:43.189
The blood on those terrorists
hands was still warm...

35:43.190 --> 35:47.210
and imagine how many others
they were planning to murder.

35:51.240 --> 35:55.269
So why do you think
they took these girls.

35:55.270 --> 35:59.309
We know the terrorists are using every
method they can do fund their activities.

35:59.310 --> 36:03.309
We know that they are
trafficking drugs.

36:03.310 --> 36:07.309
Human trafficking is just
another revenue source.

36:07.310 --> 36:11.329
Yeah, but why these
girls specifically.

36:11.330 --> 36:15.359
Imagine the value of the daughter of a wealthy
influential American on the Black Market.

36:15.360 --> 36:19.389
The bigger, more important her father
or mother is, the greater her value.

36:19.390 --> 36:23.399
Huh... well they do say

36:23.400 --> 36:27.409
that Madeline's father may well
become the next President... so...

36:27.410 --> 36:31.419
Imagine what she's worth...

36:31.420 --> 36:35.450
They're gonna be pissed
that they lost her...

36:39.480 --> 36:43.509
Well, this was quite a
surprise, Mr President.

36:43.510 --> 36:47.519
If I had known you were
coming to dinner tonight

36:47.520 --> 36:51.529
I'd have had something a little more
substantial than pizza planned...

36:51.530 --> 36:55.549
Are you kidding? Do you know how
often Margaret lets me have pizza?

36:55.550 --> 36:59.579
This is a treat.
I'm glad to hear it.

36:59.580 --> 37:03.579
So, what brings you
to our humble abode

37:03.580 --> 37:07.599
this evening, Mr President?

37:07.600 --> 37:11.609
Well, I'm actually here to ask you a favor
on behalf of the Republican Party. Oh?

37:11.610 --> 37:15.619
Don't act like this
is a surprise do you.

37:15.620 --> 37:19.639
You know that your name is being bantered around
as the party's top choice to take my place

37:19.640 --> 37:23.669
next year when I leave. We need
someone who is going to continue

37:23.670 --> 37:27.689
to be hard on terrorism... and
Madeline's kidnapping

37:27.690 --> 37:31.699
is still on everyone's mind.

37:31.700 --> 37:35.719
The American people are
angry... they want revenge.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.749
And they believe that you're the man to
make that happen. Thank you Mr President.

37:39.750 --> 37:43.779
Everything okay hun? Yeah...

37:43.780 --> 37:47.779
Friend drama.
Ah... friend drama...

37:47.780 --> 37:51.799
Well, when you got
girls, you got drama.

37:51.800 --> 37:55.819
I have three of them
and it's nonstop drama.

37:55.820 --> 37:59.849
Yes.

37:59.850 --> 38:03.880
Allahu akbar.

38:15.910 --> 38:19.919
Huh... Uh... Ankita?

38:19.920 --> 38:23.919
Come here a sec...

38:23.920 --> 38:27.939
Swanson said he, uh..

38:27.940 --> 38:31.949
His team was killed in
a drug raid gone bad...

38:31.950 --> 38:36.110
Yes, they raided a warehouse looking for drugs used
by a terrorist organization to fund their activities.

38:36.134 --> 38:39.969
They didn't find any drugs and one
of the terrorists managed to set a

38:39.970 --> 38:43.989
bomb vest off,
killing half his team.

38:43.990 --> 38:48.029
I think it was a set up.
What do you mean?

38:48.030 --> 38:52.059
I managed to utilize
the information

38:52.060 --> 38:56.069
that Jules gave me to dig
deeper into the terrorist

38:56.070 --> 39:00.089
network. I found
some CCTV footage

39:00.090 --> 39:04.109
of the warehouse where
his team was killed.

39:04.110 --> 39:08.139
Alright... found this...

39:08.140 --> 39:12.169
This where the team is moving

39:12.170 --> 39:16.179
into the warehouse... and...

39:16.180 --> 39:20.189
right here...

39:20.190 --> 39:24.199
you can tell
everything is over...

39:24.200 --> 39:28.239
they're standing down... and... I
think these are the

39:28.240 --> 39:32.269
DEA guys coming into
the warehouse...

39:32.270 --> 39:36.279
Then... this guy...

39:36.280 --> 39:40.289
He notices something wonky.

39:40.290 --> 39:44.309
Yes... and the other's too... they've
all gone tactical again.

39:44.310 --> 39:48.339
Is there audio... can you
hear what they're saying?

39:48.340 --> 39:52.359
No, just video... but watch.

39:52.360 --> 39:56.359
This is right before the
suicide bomber set off the vest.

39:56.360 --> 40:00.379
Why did they relax if there's an unknown approaching
them? I don't know... it's dark in there...

40:00.380 --> 40:04.379
you can't see much... but...

40:04.380 --> 40:08.410
right... here... right
before the best goes off.

40:12.430 --> 40:16.469
We get a clear look at her.
Sally Ranson...

40:16.470 --> 40:20.480
Yep... one of the missing
girls we're looking for.

40:24.500 --> 40:28.519
Swanson... I'll go
over the details

40:28.520 --> 40:32.549
in how we know later but right now you just
need to go with what I'm going to tell you.

40:32.550 --> 40:36.579
The terrorists aren't just
kidnapping the girls..

40:36.580 --> 40:40.589
They're brainwashing them and turning
them into suicide bombers... exactly.

40:40.590 --> 40:44.589
And each time we rescue
one and bring them home

40:44.590 --> 40:48.600
we're bringing another potential
suicide bomber back into the country.

40:52.620 --> 40:56.649
You see... we all think that based
on the publicity... What they hell??

40:56.650 --> 41:00.659
Bomb!! Don't shoot... that's
my daughter...

41:00.660 --> 41:04.669
Madeline... what
the hell is this?

41:04.670 --> 41:08.689
The enemies of God
must be struck down

41:08.690 --> 41:12.709
wherever they are. By killing
the leader of the Crusaders, I am

41:12.710 --> 41:16.710
the hammer that strikes
a blow for all Islam.

41:20.750 --> 41:24.759
Good call on hacking into the cell
system and deactivating the phone.

41:24.760 --> 41:28.779
On her vest. Do you
think I got it in time?

41:28.780 --> 41:32.809
If you hadn't, it would
already be on the news.

41:32.810 --> 41:36.819
Oh, man...

41:36.820 --> 41:40.829
Rankin's with her.

41:40.830 --> 41:44.839
He's good... she's in good hands.

41:44.840 --> 41:48.869
He'll get her stable and then give you
a list of people you can call who can

41:48.870 --> 41:52.870
continue her deprogramming. Seems they
did a really good job on her mind.

41:56.890 --> 42:00.919
Are you people going to tell me who
you are? I'm afraid not, Mr Thurman.

42:00.920 --> 42:04.939
Well I guess I will have
to win the Presidency

42:04.940 --> 42:08.959
in order to find that out, huh?

42:08.960 --> 42:12.979
I'm afraid even
that wouldn't help.

42:12.980 --> 42:16.989
Okay... I got your kung
fu right here... uh...

42:16.990 --> 42:21.010
We... Oh... Crap!!

42:25.020 --> 42:29.029
Lost him...

42:29.030 --> 42:33.059
How close were you? Uh...

42:33.060 --> 42:37.079
No telling... could have
been the next tower...

42:37.080 --> 42:41.109
There could have been
a thousand more...

42:41.110 --> 42:45.139
zero way of telling. Any thoughts
of where the call originated?

42:45.140 --> 42:49.149
Yeah... next door... or...

42:49.150 --> 42:53.159
the moon... or
anywhere in between...

42:53.160 --> 42:57.179
Whoever did this...

42:57.180 --> 43:01.209
really good...

43:01.210 --> 43:05.249
She's finally dozed off... there's a
Secret Service agent outside her door

43:05.250 --> 43:09.259
but I think she's down for the count. She's going
to need a lot of help to get through this.

43:09.260 --> 43:13.269
For now, I think rest is the best
prescription... for both of you.

43:13.270 --> 43:17.279
I think that's our cue...

43:17.280 --> 43:21.309
Mr Thurman... we'll
see ourself out.

43:21.310 --> 43:25.340
Thank you gentlemen... thank
you very much.

43:37.380 --> 43:41.399
Police say they don't have a motive
yet and the investigation continues.

43:41.400 --> 43:45.419
The race for the White
House takes a turn today

43:45.420 --> 43:49.429
with Langston Thurman throwing
his proverbial hat into the ring.

43:49.430 --> 43:53.439
The Republican candidate is now on the ticket
in the Presidential race for this November.

43:53.440 --> 43:57.459
Thurman made the announcement this
afternoon at a news conference

43:57.460 --> 44:01.479
attended by supporters and his
family... his daughter Madeline at his side

44:01.480 --> 44:05.509
as he spoke to the crowd of
hundreds of people. Thurman says he

44:05.510 --> 44:09.539
vows to keep his campaign
"clean but aggressive".

44:09.540 --> 44:13.539
He didn't expand on
what he means by that

44:13.540 --> 44:17.559
and no comments from Democrats regarding
their new challenger. Still ahead tonight.

44:17.560 --> 44:21.579
Answers to why a teenager opened
fire at a Friday night football game

44:21.580 --> 44:25.609
and the fight against terror... how
the nation's police departments

44:25.610 --> 44:29.639
are teaming up to fight
terrorism in our own country.
