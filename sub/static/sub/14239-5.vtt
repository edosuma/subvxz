00:33.240 --> 00:35.320
I do hope they're here.

00:41.119 --> 00:43.039
I have to move carefully.

I was on the phone, wasn't I?
Well, shall I call the school?

What exactly are we doing here?

06:00.120 --> 06:02.440
I've had an invitation

06:11.559 --> 06:17.519
I suppose I'm one of the
fortunate few who's been allowed
to see our little friends.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.199
And it's been no easy task.

06:24.199 --> 06:27.279
One needs to have the
patience of a saint

06:27.279 --> 06:30.600
and the blind faith of a prophet.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.360
But for me the long
wait has been worthwhile.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.000
This is my first picture.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.879
Not that clear, I know, but
the ring of stones can be seen
quite distinctly.

06:46.879 --> 06:49.640
I don't believe this. Shh!

06:52.639 --> 06:57.039
Well, of course, I'm not the
world's best photographer.

06:57.039 --> 07:02.520
But this little person
is just about visible.

07:02.520 --> 07:09.280
I was so lucky to have seen them,
so privileged to witness
such a magical moment.

07:09.280 --> 07:13.480
Because fairies are shy, you see.

07:13.480 --> 07:18.040
But I know in my heart that they're
friendly, loving creatures.

07:19.919 --> 07:22.080
Thank you.

Estelle, when did you take these?

07:33.720 --> 07:36.199
A couple of nights ago. Where?

07:36.199 --> 07:38.520
In Roundstone Wood.
Not far from here.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.880
So good to see you again, Jack.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.440
Oh, look, there's the wood.

HE SIGHS

07:46.840 --> 07:51.280
What's wrong? Oh, Jack and I have
always disagreed about fairies.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.160
I only see the good ones.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.119
He only ever sees the bad.
They're all bad.

07:56.119 --> 08:00.680
No. I refuse to believe that.
I suppose one person's good
could be somebody else's evil.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.719
That's what his father used to say.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.040
Oh, Jack, if only you had
seen them there in the wood.

08:08.040 --> 08:12.280
They were happy. They were dancing.
The fairy lights were shining.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.879
Do you have any more photos?

08:15.080 --> 08:17.599
Yes, at home. Right.

08:17.599 --> 08:19.759
I need to see them all.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.880
No! No, please...

10:13.679 --> 10:15.840
Where was she?
Walking home on her own.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.200
Jas, come here.
Do what your mum says.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.679
You're not my dad.

10:21.679 --> 10:24.360
Just bloody well do what she says.

10:25.399 --> 10:29.000
You must never walk home on your
own, you understand? It's not safe.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.719
It's all right, Mum.
No-one can hurt me.

10:35.520 --> 10:38.200
Oh, thank you, Jack.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.679
This is Moses.

10:41.719 --> 10:45.359
Hello, Moses. They're mostly
just pictures of the area.

10:47.800 --> 10:52.320
Come on, my darling, it's quite
time you went outside, isn't it?

11:05.519 --> 11:07.000
This is you.

11:09.280 --> 11:13.160
Sorry. No, that's my dad.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.919
He and Estelle were
quite an item once upon a time.

11:15.919 --> 11:18.279
They were inseparable.

11:19.719 --> 11:26.680
Then why did they part?
It was wartime, he was posted abroad,
she volunteered to work on the land.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.720
It just happened that way.

11:40.079 --> 11:41.480
WIND CHIMES RING

11:42.519 --> 11:46.480
If you don't mind me asking, did you
know Jack's father after the war?

11:46.480 --> 11:50.199
No. We lost touch. Why?
Did all three of you ever meet?

11:50.199 --> 11:54.960
You, Jack and his father?
No. Never.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.480
Jack contacted me a few years ago.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.279
I was so surprised.

12:00.279 --> 12:02.479
He's so like his dad.

12:02.479 --> 12:04.560
Same walk, same smile.

12:06.119 --> 12:08.360
I hope he's still alive.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.200
He'll be in his early nineties now.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.480
You could always ask Jack about him.

12:12.480 --> 12:16.240
I have, but he doesn't seem to
want to talk about his father.

12:16.240 --> 12:21.400
Estelle, when you next see these
creatures you call us immediately,
understand? Mm-hm.

12:21.400 --> 12:26.279
Night or day,
it doesn't matter, just call us.
And be careful, it's important to me.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.359
But, Jack,
I've nothing to worry about.

12:29.359 --> 12:31.480
Just be careful. Please.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.079
Estelle shouldn't be living in town.

12:40.079 --> 12:42.280
She belongs in the countryside.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.439
How often do you get to see her?

12:44.439 --> 12:46.039
We meet up now and again.

12:46.039 --> 12:49.240
Whenever she's seen her fairies?
She calls them fairies. I don't.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.159
What do you call them?

12:51.159 --> 12:53.320
They've never really
had a proper name.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.920
Why not?

12:54.920 --> 12:56.920
Something from the dawn of time -

12:56.920 --> 12:59.279
how could you
possibly put a name to that?

12:59.279 --> 13:03.040
Are we talking alien? Worse.
How come?

13:03.040 --> 13:07.560
Because they're part of us,
part of our world, yet
we know nothing about them.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.079
So we pretend to know what they
look like. We see them as happy.

13:11.079 --> 13:16.559
We imagine they have tiny little
wings and are bathed in moonlight.
But they're not? No.

13:16.559 --> 13:20.360
Think dangerous, think something
you can only half see like a glimpse,

13:20.360 --> 13:23.239
like something out of the corner
of your eye with a touch of myth,

13:23.239 --> 13:26.679
a touch of the spirit world, a touch
of reality, all jumbled together.

13:26.679 --> 13:29.839
Old moments and memories
that are frozen in amongst it.

13:29.839 --> 13:34.800
Like debris spinning around a ringed
planet - tossing, turning, whirling.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.760
Then backwards and
forwards through time.

13:42.319 --> 13:46.600
If that's them we have to find
them...before all hell breaks loose.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.480
Why won't she play anywhere else?

14:00.480 --> 14:02.880
She likes it down there.
Other kids have friends.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.520
Where's her friends?
Must be something wrong with her.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.480
There's nothing wrong with her.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.439
Well, when's the last time
you saw her watching TV?

14:10.439 --> 14:13.479
Or reading a book?
Or playing with a doll?

14:13.479 --> 14:15.960
Or sitting down to
have a chat with us?

14:15.960 --> 14:18.279
When's the last time
you heard her laugh?

And the girl's cousin.
I blame it on magic mushrooms.

14:53.839 --> 14:55.800
What you do in private
is none of our business.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.600
But these photographs were fake.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.399
Conan Doyle believed in them.
He was gaga at the time.

15:00.399 --> 15:03.520
And Houdini. Self-publicist.
How do you know so much about it?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.920
I wrote an essay on the Cottingley
glass-plate photos

15:05.920 --> 15:07.240
when I was at school.
HE SNIGGERS

15:08.479 --> 15:11.320
And when the girls were old ladies
they admitted they were fakes.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.480
So where was THIS sighting then?
In a place called Roundstone Wood.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.520
I know it. Has an odd history.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.920
How d'you mean odd?
It's always stayed wild.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.840
In ancient times it was considered
bad luck to walk in there
or even to collect timber.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.840
Even the Romans stayed clear of it.
I've had no report of any sighting.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.360
You won't. These things come in
under the radar,

15:30.360 --> 15:34.840
but they play tricks with the
weather, so set up a programme for
unnatural weather patterns.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.840
Right. Are you saying our
machines can't pick them up?

15:38.880 --> 15:40.520
Nothing can.

15:40.520 --> 15:44.080
What is it? Is it-is it God?

15:44.080 --> 15:47.759
Some-somewhere safe, that's all I
want, just put me somewhere safe.

15:47.759 --> 15:50.040
Got a right one here.
They tried to kill me!

15:50.040 --> 15:53.680
Said there were flowers in his mouth.
Flowers? They're trying to choke me.

15:53.680 --> 15:57.319
We checked. There was nothing.
They didn't want to hurt
that little girl. It's just me.

15:57.319 --> 15:59.319
They just want to hurt me,
to kill me.

15:59.319 --> 16:04.120
Who wants to hurt you? They won't
leave me alone. I've done wrong.
What d'you mean you've done wrong?

16:04.120 --> 16:07.320
If it's God, I'm sorry,
I can't help it!

16:07.320 --> 16:08.719
Name?

16:08.719 --> 16:10.800
It's little girls...

16:10.800 --> 16:15.079
It's their little bodies,
it's their little smiles.

16:15.079 --> 16:17.239
They're bright as buttons.

16:17.239 --> 16:20.040
Look, um, I've been in trouble
before...

16:20.040 --> 16:22.840
So just help me!

16:22.840 --> 16:24.399
JUST LOCK ME UP!

16:26.400 --> 16:27.840
Please.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.280
I asked Estelle about your dad.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.799
She said she'd never seen
the pair of you together.

16:36.799 --> 16:39.640
Why would she? She lost
touch with him after the war.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.799
I just happened to catch
up with her later.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.440
Why do you keep doubting me?
I spell out the dangers,
you keep looking for explanations.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.559
That's what police work's about.
This isn't police work. All right,
science. It's not science.

17:09.559 --> 17:12.359

It seemed like you
were talking to someone.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.160
Just talking to yourself, were you?

18:25.800 --> 18:27.759
It's lovely to hear you laugh.

18:34.119 --> 18:36.360
I thought I'd seen everything
until now.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.800
We had him locked up,
for Christ's sake, on his own.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.319
He was shouting the odds.
Said things were following him.
What kind of things?

18:42.319 --> 18:45.000
Shadows, he said. He was
going on about being choked.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.280
There were four other prisoners.
They saw nothing.
Where are they now?

18:48.280 --> 18:51.399
I've had them transferred. CCTV?
I'm dealing with that.

18:51.399 --> 18:54.159

I'd say oxygen deficiency.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.520
But it's odd.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.279
There's no fingertip bruising
on the face, no areas of pallor.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.760
Nothing to suggest that
pressure was applied? No.

19:19.360 --> 19:22.360
Yet he suffocated
alone in a locked cell?

19:22.360 --> 19:23.800
Looks like it.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.120
Wait a minute.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.319
SHE GASPS

20:05.119 --> 20:08.320
I've never seen
anything like that before.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.800
I have.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.120
Quartzite.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.799
The searching stone.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.079
Oh, let the energies flow.

20:33.079 --> 20:35.160
Help me find them again.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.839
DEMONIC LAUGHTER,

20:57.919 --> 21:00.600
TWITTERING LAUGHTER,

21:01.920 --> 21:03.439
Oh...! Oh!

21:03.439 --> 21:05.960
We know the dead man
was a convicted paedophile,

21:05.960 --> 21:07.520
used to hang around schools.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.280
Why the petals in his mouth?
Just a bit of fun on their part.

21:10.280 --> 21:11.359
You call that fun?

21:11.359 --> 21:13.640
That's the way these
creatures like to do things.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.039
They play games,
they torment and they kill. Why?

21:17.039 --> 21:19.680
As a punishment
or a warning to others.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.639
They protect their own.

21:21.639 --> 21:23.040
The chosen ones.

21:24.559 --> 21:27.520
Somehow children and the
spirit world, they go together.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.759
So how do we stop them?

21:30.759 --> 21:34.000
First we have to find out who
they want.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.720
And we can't trap them.

21:35.720 --> 21:41.359
They have control of the elements -
fire, water, the air that we breathe.

21:41.359 --> 21:44.320
They can drag that air
right out of our bodies.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.400
Sometimes I think they're part Mara.
Mara?

21:47.400 --> 21:50.959
Kind of malignant wraiths.

21:50.959 --> 21:53.080
It's where the word
nightmare came from.

21:55.039 --> 21:57.120
They suffocate people in their sleep.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.799
PHONE RINGS

22:00.959 --> 22:05.799
Yeah? Jack, it's me, Estelle.
What is it? You were right, Jack.

22:05.799 --> 22:08.760
There are bad ones.
They've come to me.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.560
Estelle, we're on our way.

22:10.560 --> 22:14.120
Stay where you are, don't go anywhere
near them, do you understand? Yes.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.680
Come on, darling.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.120
Moses!

23:13.759 --> 23:17.959
Moses...come on.

23:17.959 --> 23:21.199
Come here, darling. Come on, puss.

23:21.199 --> 23:22.680
Moses?

23:24.600 --> 23:26.080
Moses!

23:28.759 --> 23:30.279
Oh, no!

23:38.119 --> 23:39.559
Oh, no!

23:40.680 --> 23:43.960
Oh... Oh!

23:48.880 --> 23:51.600
It makes no sense.

23:51.600 --> 23:54.679
It's a fine night yet the
weather map says there's rain.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.319

24:48.360 --> 24:50.040
Estelle!

25:02.520 --> 25:04.920
Looks like she died from drowning.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.720
The rest of the
garden's dry as a bone.

25:31.119 --> 25:34.560
It wasn't your dad that
was in love with her all
those years ago, was it?

25:34.560 --> 25:36.919
It was you.

25:36.919 --> 25:40.719
We once made a vow.

25:40.719 --> 25:43.439
We'd be with each other till we died.

25:58.319 --> 25:59.919
HE KISSES HER HEAD

26:20.440 --> 26:22.000
HE SIGHS

26:24.640 --> 26:26.120
I need a drink.

26:35.079 --> 26:37.720
Where did you and Estelle meet?

26:37.720 --> 26:43.519
In London at the Astoria ballroom
a few weeks before Christmas.

26:43.519 --> 26:47.160
She was 17 years old
and she was beautiful.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.960
I loved her at first sight.

26:51.399 --> 26:53.440
But nothing lasted back then.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.840
Promises were always being broken.

26:57.919 --> 27:00.640
Estelle...

27:00.640 --> 27:02.680
to have to die like that.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.840
The petals in Goodson's mouth,

27:06.840 --> 27:09.280
where had you seen that before?

27:09.280 --> 27:10.959
Was that during the war?

27:10.959 --> 27:12.840
No.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.400
Long before then.

27:15.399 --> 27:16.879
On a troop train.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.280
HARMONICA PLAYS

27:21.280 --> 27:24.919
15 men with me in charge.

MEN CHATTER AND LAUGH

27:32.760 --> 27:35.200
Everyone happy.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.999
Too happy.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.480
Too noisy.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.480
Then we hit a tunnel.

FLAPPING OF WINGS

27:58.639 --> 28:01.800
We thought some birds had
flown in through an open window.

28:04.239 --> 28:05.719
Then came the silence.

28:16.599 --> 28:20.079
And when we came out of the tunnel,

28:20.079 --> 28:22.399
all 15 men were dead.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.080
They'd been suffocated.

28:39.080 --> 28:43.600
My squad. Men I was responsible for.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.800
But why were the men killed?

28:50.919 --> 28:54.079
About a week earlier some
of them had got drunk.

28:54.079 --> 28:58.119
Drove a truck through a village,
ran over a child, killed her.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.760
That child was a chosen one.

She's a nightmare, three hours
and wouldn't say a word,

29:52.719 --> 29:57.520
just sat glowering because she
thought I'd nicked her special
stapler. Don't worry about it.

29:57.520 --> 30:01.360
You OK? No. I've had a bit of
a weird day actually.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.759
Bloody hell!

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
What the hell's gone on here?

30:12.640 --> 30:16.279
How'd they get in? They smashed
everything up, the bastards!

30:17.680 --> 30:20.440
I'll fetch you straight home
from school, Jas.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.560
You don't want to
miss our party, do you?

30:22.560 --> 30:24.239
I'd rather play down the garden.

30:26.159 --> 30:29.920
You're right. She's spending too
much time down there. Don't worry.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.759
I'm going to put a stop to things.

30:36.640 --> 30:40.720
So what are you going to do
when they start building at
the bottom of the garden?

30:40.720 --> 30:42.679
It'll happen one day.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.840
HE SIGHS

Did someone push you, Jasmine?

31:34.159 --> 31:36.719
Yes, Miss. Who?

31:36.719 --> 31:38.639
Don't know, Miss.

31:40.359 --> 31:41.600
Come here.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.800
In the whole of my working
life I have never had to bring
the bad times home with me.

31:45.800 --> 31:50.600
I have never had to feel
threatened in my own home.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.880
But not any more, because this means
these creatures can invade my life

31:53.880 --> 31:56.360
whenever they feel like it
and I am scared, Jack.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.960
What chance did Estelle have?

31:57.960 --> 32:00.120
What chance do any of us have?

32:08.840 --> 32:12.640
You said these creatures
protect their own. Yeah.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.239
You mentioned the chosen ones.

32:15.239 --> 32:18.120
What are they? How many are there?

32:20.760 --> 32:22.399
Tell me, Jack!

32:24.600 --> 32:31.320
All these so-called fairies were
children once from different moments
in time, going back millennia.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.920
Part of the lost lands.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.399
Lost lands? What?

32:39.640 --> 32:41.519
The lands that belong to them.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.920
What exactly do they want?

32:47.920 --> 32:50.639
Why are they here?
They want what's theirs -

32:50.639 --> 32:52.960
the next chosen one.

well maybe you need a good kicking.

It was so sudden. Then it...

35:36.600 --> 35:39.520
then it just ended. Kate, is it?

35:39.520 --> 35:41.679
Was anyone hurt? No.

35:41.679 --> 35:45.199
Two children were almost scared to
death, but they're OK. What is it?

35:45.199 --> 35:48.600
I saw them. And there was
little Jasmine in amongst it all.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.520
She hadn't been touched.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.359
The sun was shining down on her.

35:52.359 --> 35:56.560
It was...it was like an aura,
like something protecting her.

35:56.560 --> 36:00.879
Who is Jasmine? Jasmine Pearce. She's
a pupil of mine. Where is she now?

36:00.879 --> 36:04.960
We're sending all the children home.
We have to. Yeah, thanks.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.400

36:15.560 --> 36:18.440

36:18.440 --> 36:20.439
It was fun.

36:20.439 --> 36:23.680
Roy said you saw some of
your friends this morning.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.560
He said you waved at them.

36:25.560 --> 36:28.879
Only Roy said when he
looked he couldn't see anyone.

36:28.879 --> 36:31.040
That's because they
were in the trees.

36:31.040 --> 36:34.159
Trees? What trees?

36:34.159 --> 36:36.960
The trees along the road.
Is this one of your games, Jas?

36:36.960 --> 36:38.880
No.

36:44.320 --> 36:46.440
Ah, boy, not got a beer?

36:58.919 --> 37:01.399
So who are they?

37:01.399 --> 37:04.640
Just friends. You should have
invited them to the party.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.679
They don't like parties.

37:06.679 --> 37:09.280
I'm not surprised if
they live in trees.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.719
Oh, they don't always live in trees.
They can be anywhere and everywhere.

37:12.719 --> 37:14.319
They can even be in this room.

37:14.319 --> 37:18.280
In this room? When?
Now. Don't be silly, Jas.

37:21.280 --> 37:25.080
So where did you meet these friends?
You must have met them somewhere.

37:25.080 --> 37:29.880
They said they'll always look
after me, even through time.

37:29.880 --> 37:33.040
When did they say that? I forget.

37:39.879 --> 37:45.240
Oh, yeah, I've got big plans for
this place, going to extend the
patio and landscape this garden.

37:45.240 --> 37:49.879
Come on, Jas, hurry up with
that food. People are hungry.

37:49.879 --> 37:52.800
So when are you going to name
the day, Roy? Shoo, never.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.239
I can't afford to keep her.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.080
No! No! Please, no! No...

38:07.080 --> 38:10.720
Jas, get away. You can't do this!
That's my own place! It's mine!

38:10.720 --> 38:13.480
I said, get away! Oh, Jas!

38:14.599 --> 38:15.679
Ow!

38:15.679 --> 38:19.239
Ah! You little bitch!

Where's Jas? Oh, she's around.

38:58.799 --> 39:00.439
Ladies and gentlemen...

39:00.439 --> 39:03.399
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention, please?

39:03.399 --> 39:06.799
As you all know, today
is a very special day -

39:06.799 --> 39:11.720
Lynn and me have been together
now for the past five years,
and not only is she my partner,

39:11.720 --> 39:14.880
but she's also been my rock
and my best friend.

39:14.880 --> 39:15.960
WOMAN: Aw...

39:15.960 --> 39:18.319
Now we're looking forward
to having children of our own.

41:01.679 --> 41:03.399
Oh, Roy...

41:06.560 --> 41:08.680
No!

41:17.000 --> 41:19.559
Do you know you're
walking in a forest?

41:22.680 --> 41:28.520
Well, you are.
It looks like a very old forest, and
it's magical. I want to stay in it.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.280
You can see this forest?

41:30.280 --> 41:33.800
Yes. But it's not here.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.000
It's just an illusion, Jasmine.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.359
It is.
WHIRRING OF WINGS

41:38.359 --> 41:41.600
Your friends are just
playing a game with you.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.080
The real forest can never come back.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.679
Oh, it can.

41:45.679 --> 41:47.840
When they take me to it.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.600
They told you this?

41:50.600 --> 41:53.719
But what about your mother?
Don't you want to stay with her?

41:53.719 --> 41:55.280
RUSTLING, ECHOING SOUND

41:55.280 --> 41:58.080
Come on. The child isn't sure.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.199
I am sure.

41:59.199 --> 42:00.880
No!

42:00.880 --> 42:02.520
Leave her alone.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.080
WHIRRING OF WINGS

42:05.080 --> 42:07.159
Find another chosen one.

42:07.159 --> 42:08.760
EERIE VOICES: Too late.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.880
She belongs with us.
The child belongs here.

42:11.880 --> 42:17.200
No. She lives forever.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.159
Jas? Where's Jas?

42:19.159 --> 42:20.679
Please, wait.

42:20.679 --> 42:23.240
You can't go down there. No! Jas!

42:23.240 --> 42:27.559
No, no! Let go! My daughter!

42:27.559 --> 42:29.959
Suppose we make her stay with us?

42:29.959 --> 42:32.999
Then lots more people will die.
Did they tell you that?
They promised.

42:32.999 --> 42:37.279
Come away, oh, human child!
Next time they'll kill
everyone at my school

42:37.279 --> 42:40.360
like they killed Roy
and that man and your friend.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.160
How do you know these things?

42:42.160 --> 42:46.280
If they want to they can make
great storms, wild seas,

42:46.280 --> 42:48.040
turn the world to ice.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.840
Kill every living thing.

42:49.840 --> 42:52.200
Let me go.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.760
The child won't be harmed?

42:53.760 --> 42:55.480
Jack, you can't...

42:55.480 --> 42:57.920
Answer me! She won't be harmed?

42:57.920 --> 43:01.319
We told you. She lives forever.

43:01.319 --> 43:03.360
A dead world.
Is that what you want?

43:05.119 --> 43:07.159
What good is that to you?

43:07.159 --> 43:09.760
There will be no more chosen ones.

43:09.760 --> 43:11.640
EERIE VOICE:
They'll find us. Back in time.

43:19.080 --> 43:20.479
Take her.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.759
Jack, NO!

43:24.840 --> 43:30.480
You asked me what chance we had
against them. For the sake of the
world, THIS is our only chance.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.760
EERIE VOICE: Thank you.

43:39.360 --> 43:40.720
SHE LAUGHS

43:41.760 --> 43:43.120
Jas!

43:45.399 --> 43:47.160
Jas!

43:48.400 --> 43:51.040
Jas, Jas...

43:53.640 --> 43:54.640
Jas!

43:59.520 --> 44:06.559
No! No! No! No!
SHE SCREAMS INCOHERENTLY

44:08.399 --> 44:10.120
Jas!

44:10.120 --> 44:11.720
SHE SOBS

44:13.720 --> 44:15.919
I'm so sorry.

44:29.519 --> 44:31.120
What else could I do?

45:26.200 --> 45:28.800
EERIE VOICES: Come away,
oh, human child!

45:28.800 --> 45:31.759
To the waters and the wild

45:31.759 --> 45:34.720
with a fairy hand in hand,

45:34.720 --> 45:39.599
for the world's more full of weeping
than you can understand.

45:39.599 --> 45:42.959
TWITTERING LAUGHTER

45:46.799 --> 45:49.600
17 disappearances within
the last five months.

45:49.600 --> 45:50.959
SCREAMING

45:50.959 --> 45:52.200
The rift is spreading

45:52.200 --> 45:54.720
and it's dumping aliens and psychos
wherever it fancies.

45:54.720 --> 45:55.719
Where is everybody?

45:58.159 --> 45:59.280
Tosh!

46:01.279 --> 46:02.479
SCREAMING

46:02.479 --> 46:03.520
Oh, my God.

46:03.520 --> 46:06.360
You can't fight them,
they're too strong.

46:06.360 --> 46:09.559
Help me! Stop them! Oh, my God.

46:09.559 --> 46:11.119
How many people have been down
here?

46:11.119 --> 46:13.240
What did this, Jack?
It can't be human.

46:13.240 --> 46:15.000
How far is this going to spread?
