Why do I have to burn
my Saturday volunteering?

00:16.141 --> 00:17.551
Oh, you're not volunteering.

00:17.643 --> 00:18.678
It's called
community service.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.805
And you wouldn't
be doing it if you didn't
pull the fire alarm

00:20.854 --> 00:22.014
during your |.Q. test.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.350

if you hadn't arrested me.

You know, sometimes
it sucks have a dad
who's the town smokey.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.693
Well, sometimes it sucks
having a daughter who's
the town delinquent.

00:32.658 --> 00:33.864
I take it back.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.403
Gee, thanks.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.200

make me do this.

You don't do this,
you won't live to be one.

Can't we just
discuss this?

I appreciate this, sir.

No need
to thank me, Fargo.
You've earned it.

01:08.318 --> 01:11.560

What did you do
to get put down here?

They're not missiles.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.659
Really?

09:02.709 --> 09:04.700
Because I have a town
full of extremely
anxious people

who think they look a lot
like missiles.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.249

a lot like missiles?

Well, I can only wait
so long and I'll need
to have answers.

things that look a lot
like missiles,

09:24.147 --> 09:25.478

popping up all over

Sorry, but Henry's
a lot smarter and faster
than me...

09:32.155 --> 09:34.737
Fargo, Fargo,
it's the best decision
you made all day. Henry?

09:34.783 --> 09:36.774
Well, it's definitely
a weapon and this machine
controls it.

09:36.868 --> 09:40.235
Well, tell me more than that.
It's set to discharge a huge
ionosphere particle beam.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.570

Okay, okay,

09:41.664 --> 09:44.952
this ion beam thingy
is what exactly?

09:45.043 --> 09:47.830
Irradiated uranium isotopes.
Oh, God.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.340
I've searched
your entire database.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.008
There's not one
single record of silos,

09:56.096 --> 09:58.929
or irradiated isotopes,
or ionosphere particle beams.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.050

10:00.100 --> 10:02.386
It's as if the machine
never existed.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.346
Did you try turning it off?

10:05.522 --> 10:07.103
Oh, why didn'tl
think of that?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.264
Fargo, turn the machine off.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.980
And that's a stupid question?

10:13.071 --> 10:15.062
I mean, you did
just turn it on, right?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.106
That was an accident.
Jack,
this machine was built

10:17.200 --> 10:18.610
at the height
of the Cold War.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.821
There is no off switch.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.277
Could you cut
the power source?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.454
And risk there's a fail-safe
and it fires immediately?

10:24.541 --> 10:26.532
I take that as a no.
How much time do we have?

in 23 hours.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.455
Well, finally
a straight answer.

10:32.006 --> 10:35.248
CARTER: We need to arrange
for transport trucks and
establish evacuation routes.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.293
Make emergency
contingencies for every
location that could be hit.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.632
Yeah, area hospitals
should be prepped
for emergency overflow.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.014
And we'll need to
estimate collateral damage

10:43.101 --> 10:45.387
in and around
the target perimeter.
Good.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.888
You can hear us, right?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.642
Unfortunately.
You're panicking.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.682
We're not panicking,
we're reacting.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.438
You say death ray,
we have a reaction.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.273
You said death ray.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.112
It's a ray, right,

10:58.158 --> 10:59.489
that causes
immediate death?

10:59.576 --> 11:01.908
Yes, it could cause
immediate death.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.862
Could simply blow up
and people here would
immediately die.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.619
It could strike Moscow
and people there would
immediately die.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.704
Then Moscow would retaliate
and people everywhere

11:10.795 --> 11:12.035
would immediate die.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.462
Evacuation's moot.
No place is safe.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.884
Well, you chose
a great time
to be indifferent.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.083
I'm not indifferent,
Shenﬁ.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.544
l'm focused.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.378
We have 24 hours
and we happen to be

11:22.473 --> 11:24.680
in the most advanced
scientific facility
in the world,

11:24.767 --> 11:26.974
housing the largest
supercomputer
in the world,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.978
populated by
the smartest scientists
in the world.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.766
We have plenty of time
to figure this out

11:31.858 --> 11:33.348
as long as
we don't panic.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.604
FARGO: But we've downloaded,
scanned and decrypted

11:35.695 --> 11:38.607
every file, every schematic
and every piece of paper
of every project

11:38.698 --> 11:40.689
ever developed here
and there's nothing.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.399
Well, maybe not
every piece of paper.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.371
HENRY:
This is every piece of paper
I pulled from Fargo's office.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.499
Something here
has to tell us
about that machine.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.624
Come on.
If scientists are so smart,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.705
how come they don't know
anything about penmanship?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.965
Pardon the alliteration,
but which would you prefer,

11:59.052 --> 12:00.633
penmanship or progress?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.221
Tequila.
Scotch.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.962
Really.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.633
What's it?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.934
It What?
|.T.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.602
lt's scribbled at the bottom
of all these pages.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.396
Oh, I don't know maybe,
information technology,

12:14.484 --> 12:17.692
perhaps from the department
from which these
documents originated.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.352
Looks more like
someone's initials.

12:19.405 --> 12:23.239
Well, you are the detective.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.066
Marshal.
Shenﬁ.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.409
That sounds like a demotion.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.617
(CHUCKLES TRIUMPHANTLY)

12:31.125 --> 12:33.081
Hand me some pics.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.832
What's the shiny thing?
Is that a solar flare?

12:38.925 --> 12:42.713
That shiny thing is a mirror.
Now, you do remember
the moon landing, right?

12:43.638 --> 12:44.969
Oh,

12:45.056 --> 12:46.341
do not tell me
that didn't happen.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.139
No, it happened,
but we didn't go to the moon
just to walk.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.592
We put mirrors
all over the moon

12:50.687 --> 12:52.598
to bounce signals
back to the earth,

12:52.689 --> 12:55.431
telescopic images,
satellite communications.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.935
Death rays?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.857
They weaponized the moon.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.442
I mean, they can bounce
a laser off the moon

13:07.495 --> 13:09.281
and wipe out
any target they want.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.452
What, like tanks and stuff?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.656
No. Cities and stuff.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.159
So, you're telling me
while the world watched,

13:16.254 --> 13:18.245
Neil Armstrong take one
small step for man...

13:18.298 --> 13:20.459
NORAD took a giant
leap for themselves.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.290
Well, with the help
from someone at Global.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.552
Someone with
the initials |.T.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.719
|.T.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.511
Oh, Irvin Thatcher.
lt's has to be
Irvin Thatcher.

13:34.605 --> 13:38.097
Irvin Thatcher was
this brilliant scientist
behind MAD.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.813
MADD? Mothers Against
Drunk Driving?

13:40.862 --> 13:43.604
Mutually Assured Destruction.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.688
That MAD.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.321
You said he was
a brilliant scientist.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.988
Was or is?

13:58.546 --> 14:00.161
FRED:
This is easily explained.

14:00.256 --> 14:05.216
The atom nucleus is comprised
of positively-charged protons

14:05.386 --> 14:07.763
and neutrally-charged
neutrons.

14:07.930 --> 14:13.516
When a nucleus
is bombarded by
a neutrally-charged particle,

14:13.686 --> 14:16.063
the result is fission.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.977
You lost me right after,
"This is easily explained."

14:24.030 --> 14:26.692
Okay,
let me try it another way.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.025
Your father is a proton.
Your mother is a neutron.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.828
You are a free radical.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.702
You're caught stealing
CD's in the mall.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.242
You hit your parents
with that news.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.411
What happens?

14:43.007 --> 14:45.214
They go nuclear?
Exactly.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.341
And split.

14:47.678 --> 14:51.262
You think
that I'm the reason
my parents split?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.098
BOTH: No, no, no, no, no.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.888

14:56.979 --> 14:58.970

I'm helping people.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.236
Fine. Be right back.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.893
Please, carry on.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.278

who's all up in your business?

15:12.537 --> 15:14.027

to talk about.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.241
Hi, Sheriff Carter,
nice to meet you.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.197
I'm looking for
a retired scientist.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.082

15:20.586 --> 15:23.077

but why do you want...

15:27.427 --> 15:28.416

15:28.511 --> 15:30.251
Wait for it.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.257
Hey, room 101,
that would be...

15:32.348 --> 15:34.259
Room 101?
Right this way.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.727
What do you need
him for, Sheriff?

15:39.772 --> 15:43.264
There's a situation.
Even the brainiacs at Global
can't figure it out.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.104
But there is one guy
in town who can

15:46.154 --> 15:49.271
and apparently,
this is the guy.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.403
Dr. Thatcher?
This is the guy?

15:53.453 --> 15:57.116
The question remains
fusion or fission?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.907
Fission? Certainly not.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.623
I haven't been fishin'
since I lived on Lake Erie.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.129
You think that's eerie?

16:07.216 --> 16:10.504
How do you explain
quasar energy paradox?

16:12.096 --> 16:14.508
Or baldness among musicians?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.724
This is the guy.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.889
CARTER: Right this way,
Dr. Thatcher.
lRVlN: This way?

16:26.777 --> 16:28.813
Give the doctor some room.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.363
Sir, sir, right this way.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.289
This machine of yours,
it's really something.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.701
It's like a riddle
inside an enigma,

16:44.795 --> 16:46.660
wrapped in ten inches
of titanium alloy.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.917
We're assuming it's similar
to other space-based weapons,

16:49.008 --> 16:50.669
using a single-channel
transponder package.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.585
Or maybe
a survivable, low-frequency
communication system.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.010
In which case,
we'd have to reassess

16:55.097 --> 16:58.681
certain aspects
of our approach.
Guys, go easy.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.349
We need launch codes,
Shenﬁ.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.554
And easy is not
going to get it.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.809
Neither is
browbeating the man.
So just give him a minute.

are behind this panel.

25:08.799 --> 25:11.632
And I know that
when you're not thinking
about nuclear holocaust,

25:11.677 --> 25:13.884
you're thinking
about Eugenia.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.096
That's what I thought.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.474
Got you with
the nuclear holocaust
thing, didn't I?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.387
I put a trace
on the hot wire.

25:24.481 --> 25:25.937
The power source
leads out the back.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.481
That is where the machine
is vulnerable.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.268
Now, if we can reach that,
then we can get to the guts
of the thing.

25:30.738 --> 25:31.853
I've got a team
in Section Five

25:31.947 --> 25:33.528
working on a laser
bombardment drill

25:33.615 --> 25:35.355
that will bore right through
the titanium shell.

25:35.409 --> 25:36.990
Yeah, unfortunately
your guys in Section Four

25:37.036 --> 25:40.654
tell me it's not titanium,
it's zirconium carbonite,
which is...

25:40.706 --> 25:41.786
Impenetrable.

25:41.874 --> 25:46.868
But, I believe
we can get there
from here

25:46.962 --> 25:48.668
through the base
of the machine.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.250
If we tunnel down,
under and up,

25:50.340 --> 25:53.377
we'll be directly
behind it and then
I think we've got a shot.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.300
Tell Fargo to give you
anything you need.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.878
And not to touch
anything you don't.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.929
Bad news, good news.
We didn't get anything
from Thatcher,

26:03.020 --> 26:04.851
but Carter wasn't hurt
in the process.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.512
And the good news?

26:08.358 --> 26:10.394
There you go, buddy.
Take a seat.

26:10.736 --> 26:15.070
I'll go look for Eugenia
and you enjoy the view
with a room.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.565
Where is that?

26:22.289 --> 26:23.745
IRVIN: Stockholm.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.573
Linus Pauling.

26:26.752 --> 26:30.415
Royal Palace.
Stockholm. Sweden.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.581
How do you know that?

26:33.634 --> 26:35.841
I don't know. I was there.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.418
VVhen?
Recently.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.424
Do you know
where Eugenia is?

26:40.474 --> 26:42.089
She's not to be disturbed.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.424
Her words, not mine.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.759
Come on. Come on.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.226
This is her.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.351
Eugenia?

26:53.445 --> 26:55.106
Eugenia, it's Zoe.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.116
Has she done
something wrong?
No, no.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.274
Eugenia, it's Sheriff Carter.
I need to talk to you.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.864
Is there something
I should know?
No.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.028
There is, isn't there?

27:07.251 --> 27:11.369
Actually, yeah, yeah.
That crack I made about
you being a delinquent?

27:11.672 --> 27:13.913
Yeah.
Didn't mean it.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.002
You're my girl.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.835
It's really bad, isn't it?
No.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.265
Eugenia!
Eugenia!

27:29.982 --> 27:30.971
Eugenia?

27:32.109 --> 27:33.098
Eugenia?

27:37.531 --> 27:39.021
Eugenia?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.454
Come in, Jo.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.489
Where are you, Jo?

27:49.877 --> 27:51.663
Come on, Jo.
Talk to us.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.005
We all live here.
We have a right to know
what's going on.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.590
What is the trajectory
of the weapon?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.460
Is there a sea-based
boost phase intercept?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.886
BOTH:
Have the launch protocols
been initiated?

27:59.970 --> 28:01.926
Don't know. Don't know.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.504
Don't know.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.888
MAN: What do you know?
Go home.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.387
We've got everything
under control.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.551
(WHIRRING)

28:10.355 --> 28:11.765
WOMAN: What is that?

28:14.943 --> 28:16.194
Except for that.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.440
Zoe, think.
Did she say anything

28:22.534 --> 28:24.035
about going anywhere,
doing anything?

28:24.119 --> 28:25.199
Not that I remember.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.699
How about family?
Did she ask the kids
to pick her up or something?

28:27.748 --> 28:29.363
It never came up, okay?
Where is that?

28:30.500 --> 28:34.084
The MENSA Think-Off?
Yeah, I seriously doubt
you can compete.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.207
No, the sundial,
where is that?

28:36.298 --> 28:37.788
Copernicus Park.
I can see...

28:37.883 --> 28:40.875
It's on the south side
of the distilled water tower.
Come on.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.084
That's where
I'll find my girl.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.589
I thought I was your girl.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.796
Wait, that sounded weird.

28:47.017 --> 28:49.053
(DRILLING)

28:51.688 --> 28:53.019
Henry...

28:56.401 --> 28:58.232
Henry, how's it...

28:59.404 --> 29:01.110
Henry,
how's the drilling going?

29:01.198 --> 29:04.406
HENRY: This laser bombardment
drill cuts through quartz
like butter!

29:04.451 --> 29:07.864
I should be done drilling
in what, five hours.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.489
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Weapon will deploy
in four hours.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.415
Drill faster.
Yeah.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.758
Oh, my God, Eugenia.
What...

29:23.887 --> 29:26.003
What are you doing?
How did you even get here?

29:26.098 --> 29:30.262
Henry souped up my chair.
I can go 50 miles
between charges.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.718
So, why have I been
pushing you around all day?

29:32.771 --> 29:34.807
I wanted you to feel good
about yourself,

29:34.898 --> 29:36.854
like you were assisting.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.478
Fine.
I didn't hate the company.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.488
Dad, are you okay?

29:56.295 --> 29:58.786
IRVIN: Eugenia.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.507
Dad, what the hell
are you doing?

30:05.429 --> 30:07.340
Why did you do that?

30:08.849 --> 30:10.339
I'm not sure.

30:10.684 --> 30:13.300
Mind your own business, Zoe.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.352
Sorry.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.430
Your anniversary.
Our anniversary.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.525
Anniversary? Of what?
You and me.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.277
Him, Thatcher.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.688
Anniversary?

30:26.074 --> 30:27.359
He never even proposed.

30:28.452 --> 30:29.658
Yes, he did.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.700
I saw it.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.620
Trust me.
Never happened.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.994
ls dementia contagious?

30:37.836 --> 30:41.545
No, okay,
in his mind he proposed.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.338
I mean right here.
That's why you come here.

30:46.053 --> 30:50.763
I come here
for lunch every day.

30:51.725 --> 30:54.011
This is where we first met.

30:56.021 --> 31:00.014
We'd sit and look at the sky.

31:00.233 --> 31:03.441
He told me
how the stars shined,

31:03.695 --> 31:06.402
how the planets revolved
around the sun,

31:08.033 --> 31:10.524
how his universe
revolved around me.

31:12.412 --> 31:16.872
And then his universe
came crashing down
and mine with it.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.247
What happened?

31:21.380 --> 31:24.747
We were going to
get married in Stockholm

31:24.841 --> 31:26.832
after Irvin won the prize.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.092
The Nobel Prize?

31:29.179 --> 31:32.342
No one imagined Linus Pauling
would win a second Nobel.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.552
It was devastating to Irvin.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.639
He had a complete
mental break the day
of the announcement,

31:39.564 --> 31:42.055
the day he was
going to propose.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.812
The day I lost
the love of my life.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.900
The picture,
the virtual Stockholm.

31:49.032 --> 31:52.900
You must think
I'm a fool pining over
a love that's gone.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.079
It's not gone.

31:55.122 --> 31:57.738
We just have to pick up
where we left off.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.032
Did I say we?

32:03.130 --> 32:04.620
Sorry.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.879
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Weapon will deploy
in three hours.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.259
Well, there's got to
be something.

32:11.304 --> 32:14.432
I mean, use explosives
to blast through the rest
of the bedrock.

32:14.474 --> 32:17.466
This machine was programmed
as a second-strike
dead man's weapon.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.677
Any kind of explosion and...

32:19.771 --> 32:22.854
I cannot believe
we built this thing
to protect ourselves.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.681
I'm gonna have to
put a call in to the DOD.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.936
You can't.
I have to.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.235
You can't.
I think that they'll notice
if we start World War III.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.112
Allison, think about it.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.273
What are you going to say,
we may accidentally
blow up Moscow,

32:33.326 --> 32:35.362
Beijing, Pyongyang
and Stockholm?

32:35.454 --> 32:37.615
Okay, I know how fond
you are of Stockholm, Nathan,

32:37.706 --> 32:39.071
but this is bigger than you.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.910
If you tell them
that we can't stop it,

32:40.959 --> 32:42.244
they're gonna try
and stop it.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.579
They'll nuke us and...
And I know.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.085
Any kind of explosion
can trigger the device.
I get it.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.496
But we're running
out of options.

32:47.591 --> 32:50.048
I beg to differ.
I'm gonna need to borrow
your Nobel.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.050
It was open.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.261
Oh. Sorry.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.892
What in the hell
are you doing?

32:57.976 --> 33:00.388

33:15.285 --> 33:16.821
You should wear
that dress more often.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.868
Do you think this will work?
Works for me.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.200
Let's hope so.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.334
Oh, Sheriff.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.833

goes off in your head,

33:24.878 --> 33:26.834

33:28.215 --> 33:29.955
You have a better idea,
I'd love to hear it.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.215
No? Yeah.
Better get started.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.390
Jo, wow, you look...

33:40.477 --> 33:43.765
No, you look the other way.
NA THAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
and distinguished colleagues,

33:43.855 --> 33:45.356
welcome to Stockholm.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.352
Robert Oppenheimer
famously said,

33:48.401 --> 33:52.394
"The atomic bomb
made the prospect
of future war unendurable."

33:52.864 --> 33:55.196
One man never forgot
those words,

33:55.283 --> 33:57.569
the man we welcome
among us today,

33:57.661 --> 34:00.528
the man whom
the Nobel Committee
of the NonNegian parliament

34:00.580 --> 34:02.741
has selected
for this year's award
of the Nobel Prize,

34:02.832 --> 34:05.369
Dr. Irvin Horatio Thatcher.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.416

34:09.923 --> 34:11.333

34:21.476 --> 34:23.012
Dr. Thatcher.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.991
I got that.

34:46.084 --> 34:49.747
He's been carrying
that speech for 40 years.

34:56.553 --> 34:59.920

go round and round

35:00.098 --> 35:02.680

Round and round,

35:13.903 --> 35:16.440
A simple little
children's song,

35:17.240 --> 35:20.607
but it was this song
that inspired my concept

35:20.702 --> 35:23.444
of Mutually
Assured Destruction.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.287
We build an A-bomb,
they build an A-bomb.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.787
We build an H-bomb,
they build an H-bomb.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.080
Round and round.
Round and round.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.967

35:39.054 --> 35:41.761
more powerful,
more deadly weapons,

35:42.641 --> 35:46.429

to my greatest achievement,

35:51.274 --> 35:55.142
In order to ensure
peace on earth,

35:56.154 --> 36:01.023
I built the deadliest weapon
in the universe.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.573
But that's the end
of the story.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.530
Let me take you back
to the beginning.

We don't have time
to go back to Never Land.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.493
Dr. Thatcher,
there's an urgent situation

36:13.546 --> 36:15.673
that needs your attention.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.255
Oh.
Sorry.

36:18.677 --> 36:23.091
I would just like to end
by thanking the committee.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.473
And Eugenia, my love,

36:28.353 --> 36:32.437
without whom this achievement
would not have been possible.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.688
We have a lot
of catching up to do.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.026
I don't like that look.
What's wrong?

36:47.122 --> 36:51.081

39:25.238 --> 39:26.318
Henry, how much time
do we have left?

39:26.364 --> 39:27.353
Thirty seconds.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.865
CARTER:
Is there any way
we can re-aim it?

39:34.956 --> 39:38.869
Once it's locked on
to its target,
it can't be realigned.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.374
Will it work?

39:44.465 --> 39:46.797
I think desperate times
call for desperate measures.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.422
Henry, when you
outfitted my Jeep,
did you put in any airbags?

39:50.722 --> 39:55.011
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
...six, ﬁve, four...
Carter, are you crazy?

39:56.144 --> 40:00.808
...three, two, one.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.524
Henry, you got it?
I got it.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.075
lt missed!
We missed the moon!

40:17.415 --> 40:18.916
HENRY: Carter! Carter!

40:19.000 --> 40:20.615
Greatjob, man.
We missed the moon!

40:20.710 --> 40:23.167
We missed the moon!
We missed it!

40:25.089 --> 40:26.374
Little help.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.415
But where did it go?

40:32.138 --> 40:34.925
MAN: The Zephyr Rover
is making its ﬁnal approach
to Jupiter.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.762
Pasadena, we have a problem.

40:45.652 --> 40:48.109
That's gonna be a shiner.
Yeah.

40:48.196 --> 40:52.439
Well,
one small step for man,
one giant welt for me.

40:52.617 --> 40:55.950
So, when are you gonna
tell him my Nobel
isn't his to keep?

40:56.037 --> 40:58.198
I don't know.
He saved your ass.
I think he earned it.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.154
No, I earned it.

41:00.249 --> 41:01.500
lt's mine.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.745
Take it away,
lose a great scientist.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.126
It's not
a difficult equation.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.536
You never know,
you might need Thatcher

41:06.631 --> 41:08.838
to dismantle
the next ticking
time bomb.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.041
Good point.

41:13.262 --> 41:14.251
Really?

41:15.974 --> 41:18.465
You did a good job, Carter.
Thanks.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.978
I had a little help
from my crew.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.477
You remember that feeling?

41:28.277 --> 41:29.437
Yeah.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.486
It's nice to know
it can last a lifetime.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.651
And kind of depressing.
A little.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.157
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:37.870 --> 41:40.361
I'm just grateful that
we finally got together.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.868
I said we again, didn't I?
Yeah.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.833
How long is this
supposed to last?

41:48.047 --> 41:50.834
See you tomorrow, Carter.
No, seriously.
