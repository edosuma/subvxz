00:14.432 --> 00:16.058
<i>Over 100 years ago,</i>

00:16.225 --> 00:17.810
<i>Titans suddenly appeared</i>

00:18.477 --> 00:21.772
<i>and devoured most of humanity,
decimating civilisation.</i>

00:26.110 --> 00:28.571
<i>The survivors built</i>

00:28.988 --> 00:30.740
<i>three massive concentric walls</i>

00:30.948 --> 00:32.783
<i>to prevent another Titan invasion,</i>

00:33.409 --> 00:37.413
<i>and managed a peaceful life inside.</i>

00:38.831 --> 00:43.169
<i>But even though the walls
have stood for 100 years,</i>

00:43.544 --> 00:45.463
<i>there are no guarantees</i>

00:45.838 --> 00:47.131
<i>they won't fall today.</i>

00:53.471 --> 00:55.222
He was fired again!

00:55.347 --> 00:57.600
What a hopeless kid.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.143
Eren? Again?

00:59.226 --> 01:00.936
What to do with him...

01:01.812 --> 01:03.022
What to do, indeed.

01:08.652 --> 01:09.987
Sorry, Dad,

01:10.321 --> 01:11.572
I need to step out.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.741
Going to see Eren?

01:14.033 --> 01:15.493
Tell him!

01:15.910 --> 01:17.745
I'm all out of job leads.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.330
I'm going now.

01:19.663 --> 01:20.831
Make it clear.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.458
The usual hill, I bet.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.668
- Be careful.
- Hey there.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.338
- Welcome!
- Can I get some rapeseed oil?

01:27.713 --> 01:29.673
It's a good crop this year.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.509
- A full tank.
- Sure thing.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.100
Outta the way!

01:47.066 --> 01:48.526
Armin!

01:49.068 --> 01:51.529
This thing you made me, it broke.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.324
See?

01:58.702 --> 02:00.037
I'll fix it later.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.083
Don't take too long!

02:07.503 --> 02:08.503
Oh, sorry.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.900
Is Mikasa around?

02:30.025 --> 02:31.026
Mikasa?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.653
Mikasa!

02:33.487 --> 02:34.655
Yes?

03:08.898 --> 03:10.232
Eren!

03:19.617 --> 03:21.452
I knew you'd be here.

03:23.454 --> 03:24.997
This thing keeps people away.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.124
It's dangerous.

03:30.628 --> 03:31.670
Chill out.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.088
It's a dud bomb.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.134
Eren!

03:37.968 --> 03:38.969
Ow...

03:39.428 --> 03:41.597
What if it explodes?

03:43.307 --> 03:44.683
So be it.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.602
I wouldn't mind

03:47.895 --> 03:49.521
if it blew us all up.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.779
Heard you got fired again.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.114
Only a month into the job.

03:59.782 --> 04:01.492
Longer than the security gig.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.995
Why can't you ever stick with something?

04:05.162 --> 04:06.789
What is it you want to do?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.167
Are you happy

04:10.709 --> 04:12.336
just taking over for your dad?

04:17.132 --> 04:19.260
Look, this runs on batteries.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.719
"Batteries"?

04:24.390 --> 04:27.434
I want to make more things like these.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.606
Just be careful so you don't get arrested.

04:33.524 --> 04:34.692
And you, Mikasa?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.318
- Me?
- Yeah.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.452
I only...

04:51.875 --> 04:53.127
Are you content?

04:57.589 --> 05:00.759
The Inner District is full of
big buildings and rich people.

05:03.178 --> 05:06.015
And lots of stuff you can't find out here.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.267
Don't you want to go?

05:13.939 --> 05:15.858
Then what about outside the Wall?

05:20.738 --> 05:21.989
Born inside the Wall,

05:23.407 --> 05:24.700
and dying inside it...

05:29.913 --> 05:31.290
You're fine with that?

05:35.294 --> 05:36.670
I'm...

05:38.797 --> 05:39.882
Not.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.974
I'm just like...

05:50.225 --> 05:52.102
This thing.

05:56.815 --> 05:57.816
Wait...

06:00.986 --> 06:02.780
Hey, let me see.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.452
Look.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.661
A woman?

06:09.745 --> 06:10.913
The ocean.

06:10.954 --> 06:11.955
"Ocean"?

06:13.123 --> 06:14.625
The big water you mentioned?

06:15.125 --> 06:17.920
This blue thing must be the ocean.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.630
Ocean?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.965
So it was real.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.469
- Not a pond?
- A billion times bigger.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.098
That really exists out there?

06:29.139 --> 06:30.808
Just like I said.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.490
I wonder if that bird

06:47.408 --> 06:50.077
has seen the ocean.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.545
Wanna see it?

07:24.194 --> 07:26.029
Protecting the Wall instead of people.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.241
Screw that job.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.285
Let's go.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.204
Wait a second.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.546
We can't get near it.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.089
This way.

07:53.557 --> 07:54.892
Hurry, over here.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.895
It'll be fine.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.027
Careful.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.120
Right?

08:32.596 --> 08:35.224
Never seen the Wall this close.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.292
Let's go.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.878
I don't need to go now.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.630
Then when?

09:06.672 --> 09:09.383
If you climb the Wall, you'll be executed.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.470
And they say the outside is full of Titans.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.848
Due to a huge bomb,
only Titans can survive outside.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.352
You seriously believe in Titans?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.648
No one's seen them in over 100 years.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.652
Yet we're holed up in here, afraid of them.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.613
I'm sick of it.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.660
Maybe the other side

09:37.619 --> 09:39.037
is paradise.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.375
Hey, what're you doing?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.754
You renegades!

09:47.838 --> 09:49.047
Come!

09:49.131 --> 09:50.549
This is off limits!

09:50.632 --> 09:52.634
Don't touch her!

09:53.760 --> 09:55.095
Stop resisting!

09:55.846 --> 09:57.472
That was uncalled for!

09:58.682 --> 09:59.808
Armin, don't!

10:02.686 --> 10:04.146
That's enough.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.689
You'll be executed!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.441
Hey, hey...

10:09.443 --> 10:10.736
You haven't changed.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.282
Old man Souda...

10:20.746 --> 10:22.164
Leave this to me.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.958
You guys can go. Hey!

10:25.042 --> 10:26.376
They're just kids.

10:28.712 --> 10:29.713
Here.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.548
Go.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.051
Go on.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.557
So, trying to show off in front of her?

10:40.599 --> 10:42.017
It's not like that.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.395
I get it, I get it.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.233
I was caught doing the same thing as a kid.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.612
I asked your mom to come along.

10:56.198 --> 10:59.117
Your dad ended up winning her, though.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.996
This isn't about that.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.708
It just pisses me off.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.339
"Even paradise could become a prison

11:13.507 --> 11:16.593
"if you take notice of the walls."

11:21.723 --> 11:24.518
Now, don't tell the others about this.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.604
We're starting a scout.

11:27.646 --> 11:28.897
A scout?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.566
You're going outside?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.735
Lies, it'll fall through again.

11:33.777 --> 11:37.572
It won't.
Looks like the council will finally pass it.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.701
The public discontent is rising.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.788
You're really

11:45.372 --> 11:47.290
going outside the Wall?

11:48.959 --> 11:50.877
We're forming a Scout Regiment.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.295
Eren,

11:53.171 --> 11:54.798
how about it?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.552
Once we find new land,

11:59.344 --> 12:01.054
we're free to live anywhere.

12:09.855 --> 12:10.856
Mikasa.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.332
- An earthquake?
- Too big for an earthquake.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.257
The Wall's shaking.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.719
It's from outside.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.096
Eren, no!

13:02.240 --> 13:05.744
So they're real.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.079
It's taller than the Wall.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.664
This can't be...

13:09.706 --> 13:11.792
I thought we were safe!

13:22.719 --> 13:24.137
There's something there.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.016
What is that?

13:28.850 --> 13:30.769
Remember our drills!

13:50.288 --> 13:52.916
Run! The Wall will be breached!

14:08.932 --> 14:10.350
The town!

14:11.935 --> 14:14.646
Hey! Run this way!

14:30.954 --> 14:32.622
Aim the cannons at the Titan!

14:32.664 --> 14:34.291
Aim the cannons at the Titan!

14:34.332 --> 14:35.792
- Prepare the cannons!
- Hurry!

14:35.876 --> 14:36.960
Prepare the cannons!

14:37.043 --> 14:38.378
We don't have permission

14:38.461 --> 14:40.046
to use gunpowder yet...

14:41.965 --> 14:44.467
Hurry, they're coming!

14:45.510 --> 14:46.678
Hurry!

14:47.846 --> 14:50.265
Don't panic! Remember the drills!

16:06.132 --> 16:07.884
Look at those faces...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.572
Prepare the cannons!

16:29.864 --> 16:32.075
- Draw them in!
- Yes, sir!

16:32.158 --> 16:33.743
Prepare the cannons!

16:34.452 --> 16:35.745
Cattle.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.415
Cattle, cattle.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.797
- Ready to fire!
- Fire!

16:55.265 --> 16:56.349
It's a hit!

16:56.433 --> 16:57.851
Did we get it?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.785
The legend was true.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.247
They're immortal.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.209
Reload!

17:28.048 --> 17:29.507
Reload!

17:29.591 --> 17:30.633
Come on!

17:30.717 --> 17:31.718
Hurry!

17:32.260 --> 17:33.470
What're you doing?

17:33.511 --> 17:35.013
It's hopeless.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.642
Kill the Titan!

17:51.863 --> 17:54.115
Help me! I'm sorry...

17:55.784 --> 17:58.203
I'm sorry!

18:11.883 --> 18:14.052
Squad Leader! Squad Leader!

18:35.657 --> 18:36.699
Let's run!

18:37.117 --> 18:38.243
Armin!

18:56.344 --> 18:58.263
That thing won't...

19:15.280 --> 19:17.407
I'm gonna check on my home!

20:07.624 --> 20:09.417
Armin, run...

20:09.459 --> 20:12.086
That's Armin's dad.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.171
Let's go!

21:09.394 --> 21:10.603
Don't cry!

21:12.105 --> 21:13.523
Let us in!

21:14.023 --> 21:15.316
Don't push!

21:19.112 --> 21:20.113
Wait!

21:22.699 --> 21:23.992
Wait!

21:24.534 --> 21:25.576
That woman...

21:26.369 --> 21:27.578
I'll go.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.085
Get up! Get up!

21:36.838 --> 21:37.964
I'll get the baby.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.052
Mikasa!

21:48.224 --> 21:49.934
That's it, close it!

21:50.018 --> 21:52.312
Now! Close that door!

21:55.064 --> 21:56.399
Mikasa!

22:11.414 --> 22:12.498
Why?

22:13.249 --> 22:14.625
There's still room!

22:14.709 --> 22:16.669
Don't you dare open it!

22:17.295 --> 22:19.255
The Titans are coming!

22:19.339 --> 22:22.342
Only trying to save yourselves...

22:39.692 --> 22:40.693
Mikasa!

22:43.613 --> 22:44.614
Mikasa.

22:48.785 --> 22:49.786
Hold him down!

22:50.286 --> 22:51.371
Let me go!

22:54.374 --> 22:55.833
Mikasa!

23:54.225 --> 23:55.226
Mikasa...

24:58.206 --> 24:59.749
Help!

26:07.900 --> 26:10.111
Two Years Later

26:10.152 --> 26:12.488
The price for our years of peace

26:13.823 --> 26:16.033
was paid for with tragedy.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.038
The Outer Wall in the Monzen District

26:22.206 --> 26:25.459
was destroyed by a Titan
larger than ever imagined.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.422
Unable to counter the surge of Titans,

26:30.256 --> 26:33.050
we abandoned the agricultural zone

26:34.010 --> 26:37.722
and retreated behind the Middle Wall
to the commercial zone.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.227
With hordes of refugees

26:43.686 --> 26:46.397
and the loss of farmlands,

26:47.064 --> 26:49.442
our food shortage is becoming dire.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.238
In order to reclaim our farmlands,

26:55.781 --> 26:58.034
we must restore the broken Outer Wall.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.828
This, we vowed!

27:02.246 --> 27:04.749
It is to carry out this prestigious mission

27:05.291 --> 27:08.377
that you have all completed your training.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.380
- Weapons Squad Leader Hans.
- Sir!

27:14.216 --> 27:17.720
The days of our being trampled
by Titans are over.

27:18.471 --> 27:21.474
Now we have omni-directional mobility gear!

27:32.318 --> 27:34.403
With ODMG,

27:34.445 --> 27:36.447
victory will be ours!

27:40.618 --> 27:43.037
At the Omotemachi transit point,

27:43.412 --> 27:46.749
we will join the recon team
led by Captain Shikishima.

27:47.249 --> 27:48.584
Captain Shikishima!

27:49.585 --> 27:52.088
We will depart for Monzen at sunset.

27:55.007 --> 27:58.260
May you fight to honour
the spirits of the war dead.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.388
Give your hearts!

28:00.429 --> 28:02.098
Give your hearts!

28:10.606 --> 28:12.942
I'll be back, so take care of Mom.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.152
The family's in your hands.

28:18.155 --> 28:21.283
Now that's a good daughter.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.077
You were always a glutton,

28:23.661 --> 28:25.246
never making yourself useful...

28:26.038 --> 28:29.208
Sasha, pick 'em up! Pick 'em up, I said!

28:29.291 --> 28:31.544
- I'm sorry.
- Just do it, Sasha.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.546
I can't get it.

28:33.629 --> 28:37.133
Jean, my son, you must take revenge for me.

28:37.216 --> 28:40.511
Jean, become the pride of our clan.

28:40.594 --> 28:43.347
Offer your soul
to the spirits of the war dead...

28:43.431 --> 28:45.057
Jean! Jean!

28:45.683 --> 28:46.976
My son!

28:47.017 --> 28:49.812
Mommy's only going to be
gone for a little bit, OK?

28:49.895 --> 28:51.272
Just be a good girl and...

28:51.313 --> 28:52.314
Riko!

28:54.024 --> 28:55.317
Riko!

28:58.696 --> 29:01.615
Hey, don't cry, little brother...

29:01.657 --> 29:02.658
Hey, hey...

29:02.783 --> 29:06.120
Koyuki, who's this?
Is this supposed to be me?

29:06.162 --> 29:08.205
It's a little fat to be me, no?

29:08.664 --> 29:12.001
Hey, don't cry, I'll be fine.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.673
Cry baby.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.345
No one's gonna be waiting for us.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.685
Mister.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.616
Here, you can have this.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.454
Thanks.

29:50.164 --> 29:53.167
Koyuki, your brother's leaving now.

29:53.209 --> 29:54.210
Brother...

29:54.293 --> 29:55.419
Koyuki, let's go.

30:08.057 --> 30:09.391
Here.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.434
Thank you.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.570
That's mine.

30:24.782 --> 30:26.450
Mr Souda.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.078
Armin.

30:29.787 --> 30:30.913
Old man Souda?

30:31.997 --> 30:33.207
Eren?

30:36.919 --> 30:37.920
So you're alive!

30:47.805 --> 30:48.931
So now...

30:51.600 --> 30:53.102
You boys, too.

30:55.271 --> 30:56.897
Well, everyone died.

31:03.946 --> 31:05.656
What happened to the girl?

31:10.995 --> 31:13.455
- It was my fault.
- That's not true.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.463
That's why

31:22.798 --> 31:24.592
I'm going to kill it.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.677
Revenge on the Titans, eh?

31:29.972 --> 31:31.974
Killing one or two

31:33.142 --> 31:35.227
won't make a difference, you know.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.988
Why did you volunteer, then?

31:47.990 --> 31:49.825
To see my wife and child.

31:51.827 --> 31:52.912
They're waiting.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.464
Excuse me!

32:05.007 --> 32:06.550
Who're you?

32:09.261 --> 32:10.596
I'm sorry.

32:12.389 --> 32:15.517
Are you finished?

32:22.524 --> 32:24.735
Are you even listening?

32:25.778 --> 32:27.655
Look, right now,

32:27.696 --> 32:29.490
the Outer Wall in Monzen

32:30.074 --> 32:32.534
has a hole in it like this.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.204
So we detonate this portion

32:35.287 --> 32:36.956
to plug that hole.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.875
The Wall here becomes shorter,

32:40.501 --> 32:43.587
but it's twice as tall as the Titans.

32:43.963 --> 32:47.341
So we can stop any more
Titans from entering.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.844
That's the Outer Wall Restoration Mission.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.388
Once we plug that hole,

32:52.429 --> 32:54.473
we exterminate the Titans inside!

33:00.312 --> 33:01.939
Sasha.

33:06.193 --> 33:10.447
But previous restoration
missions failed miserably.

33:10.948 --> 33:13.534
They were attacked by Titans
before reaching the Wall,

33:13.575 --> 33:15.577
and ran out of explosives.

33:16.954 --> 33:19.081
We no longer have materials
to make the bombs.

33:19.832 --> 33:23.752
All that's left are
the last explosives in Omotemachi.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.090
If we fail,

33:29.800 --> 33:32.261
it'll be the end of humanity.

33:37.141 --> 33:38.434
We have no choice.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.602
You don't have to.

33:45.566 --> 33:48.610
Pipsqueaks like you just get in the way.

33:51.155 --> 33:54.033
Not just you, look around.

33:54.992 --> 33:57.202
Just a bunch of useless bums.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.623
It's been a long war of attrition.

34:02.624 --> 34:05.461
Inevitably there will be
more inexperienced folks.

34:05.502 --> 34:06.962
Sure.

34:07.629 --> 34:12.259
But even the Scout Regiment
was wiped out in this mission.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.386
Instead, we've got

34:17.139 --> 34:19.850
a potato girl whose mind is only on eating...

34:25.230 --> 34:27.065
Seconds, please.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.275
How could you eat right now?

34:30.402 --> 34:31.987
Sorry, lady.

34:35.657 --> 34:37.159
Not enough farmlands.

34:38.077 --> 34:41.080
But I was told workers won't ever go hungry.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.831
How naÃ¯ve are you?

34:44.166 --> 34:46.376
Your parents sold you to save costs.

34:50.130 --> 34:53.717
You all came here because
you couldn't find work.

34:54.510 --> 34:58.847
Now I'm being lumped with
you scum who're just here to die.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.935
Stop with this talk of dying.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.441
I can't... I just can't do this!

35:09.525 --> 35:11.777
Lil, Lil, Lil...

35:13.695 --> 35:15.906
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

35:18.951 --> 35:21.078
Damn love birds, get a room.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.747
He seems annoyed.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.707
He's afraid of Titans.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.795
You nailed it.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.676
Titans are like nothing to me.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.345
Do Titans have nipples?

35:41.557 --> 35:42.850
Do they have nipples?

35:45.602 --> 35:47.896
You talk big for having never seen one.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.234
Just a spoiled brat from inland.

35:57.030 --> 35:59.158
- Say that again.
- They don't!

36:01.702 --> 36:05.414
I told you, Titans have
no reproductive organs.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.292
So they have no nipples, either.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.711
How they propagate is a mystery.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.840
I want to dissect one,
but they evaporate when they die.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.259
So I need a live Titan!

36:18.218 --> 36:19.887
I want to do this!

36:25.601 --> 36:27.603
Gather in 10 minutes for gear check.

36:28.312 --> 36:29.605
Yes, sir!

36:33.942 --> 36:35.569
Oh, that reminds me...

36:36.653 --> 36:40.574
There was a guy who abandoned
his girl when he saw a Titan.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.203
Bet he's missing his nuts, too.

36:47.331 --> 36:49.750
Hey, stop it! Knock it off!

36:56.465 --> 36:58.258
Why do you two always go at it?

36:58.634 --> 37:00.594
Sannagi, let me down!

37:05.515 --> 37:06.808
Let go of me!

37:09.478 --> 37:10.896
We gather in 10.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.126
Hey, pick up the pace!

37:33.168 --> 37:34.628
This way!

37:36.255 --> 37:37.256
Hurry up!

37:39.174 --> 37:40.842
Don't lag!

37:50.018 --> 37:51.103
It'll be OK.

37:59.695 --> 38:01.196
You're going home.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.866
You're from Monzen, right?

38:06.368 --> 38:07.536
Everyone died.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.330
I want to go home, too.

38:12.666 --> 38:15.502
Sannagi, were you from a Yuen farm?

38:16.461 --> 38:19.506
Yeah, I want to go home and farm again.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.718
For my brothers and sisters.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.971
I'd do anything for them.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.351
The old road to Omotemachi.

38:32.311 --> 38:35.897
Titans sleep at night,
and their eyes won't work anyway.

38:35.939 --> 38:38.025
So we'll go straight to Omotemachi by dawn.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.068
But do not raise your voices.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.988
Titans are very responsive to human voices.

38:43.572 --> 38:44.906
And the other Titans will notice.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.908
Bite your tongue before you scream!

38:46.992 --> 38:51.079
If you don't want to die,
get to Omotemachi by dawn.

38:51.455 --> 38:53.248
- Open the gate!
- Open the gate!

39:04.134 --> 39:05.594
Ready to move out, sir!

39:07.429 --> 39:08.930
Move out.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.617
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

40:04.403 --> 40:07.322
Past this hell, the Goddess
awaits at Omotemachi.

40:07.823 --> 40:08.990
The Goddess?

40:09.408 --> 40:10.450
You don't know?

40:10.492 --> 40:13.662
The Titan-slaying female
squad leader under Shikishima.

40:14.496 --> 40:17.416
They say she killed over
10 Titans in half a year.

40:18.834 --> 40:21.837
Sounds more like a Grim Reaper
than a goddess.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.014
- I'm afraid.
- Don't worry.

41:25.734 --> 41:27.360
There's something there.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.571
Stop the vehicles.

41:33.325 --> 41:35.202
- Already there?
- Awfully early.

41:42.709 --> 41:45.212
What's going on? This isn't Omotemachi.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.424
Check the premises. Move out.

42:09.486 --> 42:10.737
Oh, come on.

42:10.779 --> 42:12.155
What is it?

42:14.115 --> 42:15.700
Just cattle.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.869
Do Titans only eat humans?

42:18.954 --> 42:21.331
Forward. Each squad to the front.

42:31.299 --> 42:34.761
Potato Girl, you'll wake up
the Titans with that noise.

42:36.846 --> 42:37.973
Here.

42:38.473 --> 42:39.849
Not enough?

42:48.984 --> 42:50.735
You always feed me.

42:52.487 --> 42:53.488
Wait.

42:54.281 --> 42:58.034
Still no Titans coming out.
We should get there by dawn.

42:59.703 --> 43:03.415
Hey, don't say it aloud. You'll jinx us.

43:07.168 --> 43:08.795
All clear, let's go.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.682
I hear a child...

43:26.813 --> 43:28.398
A child left behind.

43:28.481 --> 43:29.899
Don't be stupid.

43:33.194 --> 43:34.654
We have to help.

43:35.530 --> 43:36.656
Hey.

43:38.533 --> 43:40.160
We have to help.

43:56.885 --> 43:58.261
Hiana.

44:00.722 --> 44:01.890
I can hear it.

44:33.922 --> 44:35.090
Shit.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.406
We're close.

45:52.667 --> 45:54.127
Get up!

46:04.095 --> 46:05.346
Those idiots.

46:11.978 --> 46:13.563
Where? Where are they?

46:13.646 --> 46:15.273
Hey, keep it down.

46:15.690 --> 46:17.317
You'll wake up the Titans.

46:18.067 --> 46:19.694
Keep calm. Keep calm!

46:20.528 --> 46:21.571
Keep calm!

46:23.072 --> 46:24.824
No matter what happens...

46:31.623 --> 46:32.707
Captain!

46:37.045 --> 46:38.046
They brought them.

46:57.065 --> 46:58.566
Director General!

47:01.444 --> 47:02.445
Go! Go!

47:03.071 --> 47:04.197
Forward!

47:04.614 --> 47:06.491
Hey, wait!

47:06.908 --> 47:08.409
We're not on yet!

47:10.537 --> 47:11.579
You guys, wait!

47:11.663 --> 47:14.040
There are tall buildings up ahead!

47:14.082 --> 47:16.000
Run and meet us there!

47:16.084 --> 47:17.085
We're not fighting?

47:17.210 --> 47:19.254
- What about the ODMG?
- Where do we fire them?

47:19.754 --> 47:21.881
We can't beat them head-on.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.185
Go!

47:48.700 --> 47:49.826
Armin!

47:52.620 --> 47:53.746
Sannagi!

48:09.053 --> 48:10.763
Don't raise your voices...

48:42.128 --> 48:44.255
We're almost there! Run!

48:47.175 --> 48:49.510
- We're there!
- That's Omotemachi!

48:55.266 --> 48:56.351
Kill them!

48:58.478 --> 49:00.063
<i>Titans are not invincible.</i>

49:01.147 --> 49:03.024
Even if you destroy their limbs

49:03.107 --> 49:05.944
or head, they'll quickly regenerate.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.446
But this spot right here!

49:08.780 --> 49:12.575
If the nape is severely damaged,

49:12.659 --> 49:14.661
it will perish without regenerating.

49:14.702 --> 49:18.206
However, it's difficult to
attack this area with firearms.

49:19.499 --> 49:22.752
Currently, what's most effective is this.

49:23.836 --> 49:24.879
The omni-directional mobility gear!

49:25.713 --> 49:29.550
<i>With this on our hips, we can move
quickly and freely in the air.</i>

49:30.343 --> 49:33.721
Fire the anchor and reel it in
to lift yourself up.

49:34.222 --> 49:36.557
<i>Maintain the height as you aim for the nape.</i>

49:37.558 --> 49:40.645
<i>Of course, remember to evade
the Titan's attacks.</i>

49:41.729 --> 49:44.399
Then use the blades to carve
the flesh from the nape.

49:45.566 --> 49:48.069
<i>Without its nape, the Titan will die.</i>

49:48.778 --> 49:52.115
Once a Titan dies, its body will evaporate.

49:54.325 --> 49:58.454
<i>At present, this is the only
known method of killing a Titan.</i>

49:59.831 --> 50:01.416
The Scout Regiment!

50:01.791 --> 50:03.668
That's Captain Shikishima.

50:04.085 --> 50:06.629
Wouldn't mind a hot Titan chick for once.

50:10.758 --> 50:11.926
They're still here!

50:18.725 --> 50:20.101
We're finished!

51:44.018 --> 51:45.895
I'm tying it. Hang in there.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.068
Director General Kubal is here.

52:01.202 --> 52:02.870
You guarded the explosives well.

52:04.038 --> 52:06.582
I attempted to inspect the contents,

52:09.085 --> 52:11.420
but this was impossible to open.

52:33.067 --> 52:35.653
Director General, what about the explosives?

52:38.406 --> 52:41.033
There are rumours of an insurgency, you see.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.174
I see.

52:57.633 --> 52:59.677
Certainly safe down there.

53:00.386 --> 53:03.347
Sorry, it was top secret.

53:06.559 --> 53:09.437
Finish loading by dawn!

53:10.605 --> 53:13.691
They're our last explosives,
treat them with care.

53:24.285 --> 53:26.245
You messed this whole thing up!

53:29.498 --> 53:31.751
If you wanna die, do it alone!

53:33.169 --> 53:35.129
You've got a death wish.

53:40.009 --> 53:42.637
You smell, you spoiled brat.

53:46.474 --> 53:48.309
You peed in your pants, huh?

53:50.895 --> 53:52.605
The Titans scared you?

53:57.944 --> 53:58.945
Hey!

54:00.863 --> 54:01.864
Stop it.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.408
Stop it!

54:22.009 --> 54:23.344
You're too slow.

54:24.011 --> 54:25.304
You're the one who's slow.

54:26.347 --> 54:27.348
Thanks.

54:40.736 --> 54:42.196
What the hell...

54:43.364 --> 54:44.824
Enough with the disturbance.

54:47.702 --> 54:48.828
Mikasa.

54:51.372 --> 54:54.375
Mikasa, it's you, right? What happened?

55:05.886 --> 55:06.971
Nice kick...

55:07.763 --> 55:09.390
It's Captain Shikishima!

55:10.182 --> 55:11.934
...for just messing around.

55:13.894 --> 55:14.895
Rookie, your name?

55:15.646 --> 55:17.690
Eren. I'm Eren!

55:22.028 --> 55:23.112
Eren?

55:27.908 --> 55:29.327
From Monzen?

55:35.833 --> 55:37.043
Your parents?

55:38.419 --> 55:41.422
They died. I was too young to remember.

55:41.464 --> 55:42.465
I see.

55:44.633 --> 55:45.634
About Mikasa...

55:48.179 --> 55:49.764
Why is she...

55:50.431 --> 55:51.766
Why?

55:52.558 --> 55:53.809
Why what?

55:54.769 --> 55:57.438
Why is she able to toy with Titans?

55:59.899 --> 56:01.692
I taught her.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.653
You want to learn, too, huh?

56:06.447 --> 56:07.782
Well, of course...

56:09.033 --> 56:10.659
I want to defeat the Titans.

56:12.036 --> 56:13.037
Why?

56:13.913 --> 56:15.456
Because I hate them...

56:17.124 --> 56:18.667
Those Titans.

56:18.751 --> 56:20.211
Why do you hate them?

56:22.254 --> 56:23.464
Because

56:24.632 --> 56:26.967
they're the ones who trapped us in.

56:28.969 --> 56:30.471
Wrong.

56:33.682 --> 56:35.518
The true enemy

56:37.812 --> 56:39.438
isn't the Titans.

56:40.147 --> 56:41.148
The true enemy?

56:47.029 --> 56:48.489
The true enemy

56:50.241 --> 56:51.909
is safety.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.331
What do you call animals that live

56:58.249 --> 57:00.418
inside fences in fear of wolves?

57:04.505 --> 57:05.714
Cattle.

57:06.507 --> 57:08.175
And what are you?

57:08.676 --> 57:09.677
I'm...

57:11.303 --> 57:12.638
Not!

57:15.683 --> 57:17.101
Then go fly.

57:17.685 --> 57:18.811
Fly?

57:23.315 --> 57:26.485
You can only gain by letting go.

57:46.714 --> 57:50.968
The kid I gave this to... He died.

58:02.271 --> 58:05.065
I hear there used to be lots of machines.

58:05.691 --> 58:07.943
People back then even flew the skies.

58:12.364 --> 58:14.408
But now it's forbidden.

58:24.210 --> 58:25.878
- Director General!
- At ease.

58:28.797 --> 58:33.636
Tell me, did you learn in school
what that technological advancement

58:34.762 --> 58:36.096
led to?

58:37.014 --> 58:39.433
Environmental destruction,
wasted resources,

58:39.475 --> 58:41.769
useless competition and war.

58:42.353 --> 58:43.395
Precisely.

58:44.688 --> 58:47.149
Now get yourself some good rest.

58:47.233 --> 58:48.984
Yes, sir!

58:56.700 --> 58:58.577
At daybreak, we head for Monzen.

58:58.619 --> 59:01.455
Inspect your gear and rest up.

59:05.417 --> 59:07.086
Fighting is the one thing

59:08.295 --> 59:10.130
he was always good at.

59:12.675 --> 59:14.176
You reek of booze.

59:15.302 --> 59:17.680
Why do you hate that guy so much?

59:19.306 --> 59:20.432
His face...

59:20.933 --> 59:24.144
As if he's carrying
the world's misery by himself.

59:25.646 --> 59:27.565
He lost his girlfriend, right?

59:30.776 --> 59:32.987
Her name was Mikasa.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:12.651
Mikasa.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.669
I'm just...

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:39.386
Glad.

01:00:41.889 --> 01:00:43.515
Glad?

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.447
That baby was eaten.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.750
And so was I.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.117
The world is cruel.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.794
I'm just going to kill Titans.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:17.651
Sorry.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:20.863
Did I interrupt?

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.826
No.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.386
Want it? It's good.

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:01.129
Calling the Titans again?

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.429
Sorry.

01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:15.811
It should be me apologising.

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:20.899
Forget it.

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:31.994
What happened between
you and Squad Leader Mikasa?

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.668
Still act like a kid, huh?

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:43.881
It doesn't matter any more.

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:48.468
- There's someone here.
- It's fine, they're not looking.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:49.553
Hey, wait.

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:52.139
Your back feel OK?

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.309
Lil, I love you.

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:59.021
Wonder if those two will get to marry.

01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:08.614
If they make it home alive.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:13.410
It's not right that we need
permission to get married.

01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:19.625
And even if you have a baby...

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:27.174
Riko...

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:33.680
You have a daughter, was it?

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:42.397
By volunteering for duty, I get child support.

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:56.453
You OK with a single mother?

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:18.225
Will you be father to my daughter?

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:58.640
I don't want to die! No, let me go!

01:06:58.724 --> 01:06:59.766
Riko!

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.658
We're surrounded! We're under attack!

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.285
We're under attack!

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.494
We're under attack!

01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:21.580
Hurry! Put on your ODMG!

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:23.290
Lil!

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.919
The enemy's here!

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.424
- Lil, let's go!
- Wait!

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.599
Defend the explosives!

01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:48.273
Too narrow here to fire our anchors!

01:07:48.315 --> 01:07:50.192
ODMG troops to the rooftop!

01:07:51.026 --> 01:07:52.152
Damn!

01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:01.912
Four ahead, you go left.

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:03.497
Will do.

01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:21.098
Quit fidgeting, at least die with dignity.

01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:27.372
Die!

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.383
Come on, move it!

01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:42.429
Stop, stop it! I, I...

01:09:42.554 --> 01:09:44.598
Just come!

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:47.725
It's all about the explosives!

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.810
Defend them at all costs!

01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:55.442
This side is gone, retreat!

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:03.742
Come.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.539
Hey, wake up! I said wake up!

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:12.959
Please, wake up...

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.004
It's dangerous here, let's go.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.883
Wait!

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.302
Will you please treat him?

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.932
I'm sorry, but your boyfriend is...

01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:31.770
No!

01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:35.190
Fukushi...

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:38.610
We have to go.

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:42.614
Let me go! Let me go!

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:45.158
I'll kill them Titans!

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:46.993
I'll kill them!

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:53.500
Let's go.

01:10:58.129 --> 01:11:00.924
Hey. Who's driving that?

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:03.551
No one gave you permission!

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:06.805
Thief! He's stealing the explosives!

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.476
Stop! Stop! Get out!

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:30.704
Move!

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:35.500
Die, you Titans!

01:12:05.739 --> 01:12:07.699
Stop it! Stop the vehicle!

01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:09.492
- Why's it on fire?
- Stop it!

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:13.538
There you are!

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:17.083
I'll kill you all!

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:24.132
Get down! Get down!

01:12:24.466 --> 01:12:25.467
Fukushi...

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:36.811
How pretty.

01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:40.774
But such a waste.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.240
The explosives. That was it!

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:50.492
Don't! You're gonna die!

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:56.414
How could this happen?

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.257
This belonged to the thief.

01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:38.039
This is hell...

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.506
What are you doing here?

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.848
Humans are...

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.310
Weak, you see.

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:07.318
We'll be eaten.

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:12.699
Now's the chance. Let's run.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.539
What do you call animals that live
inside fences in fear of wolves?

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:21.040
Cattle.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:22.375
And what are you?

01:14:22.834 --> 01:14:23.960
I'm not!

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.336
Then go fly.

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:29.674
<i>Then go fly.</i>

01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:37.557
I can't! There's no way we're going to win!

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:42.395
Then be that way for the rest of your life!

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:01.247
That bastard...

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:09.422
Damn it.

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:11.591
You can't fear being caught!

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:14.177
Fly right into them!

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.762
Fly!

01:15:30.652 --> 01:15:31.694
Close one.

01:15:32.237 --> 01:15:35.031
Always go back to deliver the final blow.

01:15:35.907 --> 01:15:37.075
I'll do it!

01:15:39.327 --> 01:15:40.745
You're mine!

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.486
Well, sometimes we're unlucky.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.203
Hey!

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:24.914
Hey, look!

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.293
Jean!

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:33.256
He only talked big.

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:36.467
Everyone, I have a plan.

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:54.694
Hey!

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:58.656
Pull back.

01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:03.077
Hey, big guy! Wanna eat more?

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:06.205
Then try eating me!
You can never eat enough!

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:11.502
What, you clunkhead? You angry, huh?

01:17:11.878 --> 01:17:13.129
Mr Souda, please...

01:17:18.009 --> 01:17:19.218
Guys...

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:22.221
Come here, Titans!

01:17:25.016 --> 01:17:26.392
Come on, you slowpokes!

01:17:58.966 --> 01:17:59.967
Now!

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:07.350
Don't mess with me!

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:09.435
Well done!

01:18:09.936 --> 01:18:11.479
Good, let's move on!

01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:14.482
Where's Eren?

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:16.442
Somewhere up there, dead.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.369
Armin!

01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.406
Damn, they're not working!

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:58.377
Armin!

01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:29.575
Armin!

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:35.289
I won't let you

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:39.377
die here!

01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:47.844
Eren!

01:20:50.096 --> 01:20:51.264
Armin!

01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:35.433
Hiana!

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:00.833
<i>I'm driving you all out.</i>

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:13.262
We're done here! It's full of Titans!

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:15.514
Something's calling them.

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:17.975
- Where's Captain Shikishima?
- Fighting, probably.

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:20.269
Where's the Director General
and the Guards?

01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:22.021
They already evacuated.

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:25.858
Don't tell me they used us as bait.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:30.821
Don't come near!

01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:33.115
Hey, get away, Minami!

01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:36.494
Minami!

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.250
Mikasa.

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:51.092
Eren was eaten.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.057
It was my fault.

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:05.398
I'm sorry.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.664
I'll carve an escape path.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:24.917
Our task is still to kill Titans.

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:29.839
You can't! You're almost out of gas!

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:26.645
Come!

01:25:34.672 --> 01:25:36.090
What was that voice?

01:25:41.387 --> 01:25:42.555
What's going on?

01:25:50.563 --> 01:25:52.565
A Titan attacking a Titan?

01:25:56.402 --> 01:25:57.736
What's happening?

01:25:57.778 --> 01:25:58.904
What's with that arm?

01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:00.865
It's regenerating so fast!

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:15.838
They're gathering here.

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:04.720
Is he on our side?

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:15.856
His fighting clearly
demonstrates intelligence.

01:27:37.628 --> 01:27:39.338
I've never seen this!

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.854
It's him...

01:28:29.555 --> 01:28:31.140
Mikasa, get back here!

01:28:39.273 --> 01:28:41.233
Like hell he's on our side!

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:43.902
Eren?

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:47.990
Is it my fault?

01:29:26.612 --> 01:29:27.780
Mikasa.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.366
- You OK?
- Can you stand?

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:45.381
Is he dead? So he's finally out of steam.

01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:48.592
He'll evaporate! He's gonna evaporate!

01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:50.552
Ow, it's steaming hot!

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:54.014
Cut open his nape,
but don't injure the inside!

01:29:54.098 --> 01:29:55.974
What? What're you talking about?

01:29:56.016 --> 01:29:59.061
Just do it!
Hurry or he'll be absorbed into the Titan!

01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:01.480
The cells will assimilate!

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:03.816
What?

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:38.267
- Is that Eren?
- Eren...

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:43.021
I see.

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:46.692
So that's why the Titans'
weak spot is the nape.

01:30:53.991 --> 01:31:00.164
"Be careful when you fight
the monsters, lest you become one."

01:31:22.895 --> 01:31:29.902

01:32:28.627 --> 01:32:32.130
Are you a human? Or a Titan?

01:32:32.965 --> 01:32:35.259
<i>Eren is humanity's last hope.</i>

01:32:35.342 --> 01:32:36.635
We're not cattle.

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:39.096
What triggers explosive cell divisions?

01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:41.139
They're like-minded comrades.

01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:42.808
His consciousness is overtaken by instinct.

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:45.686
<i>We must nip evil in the bud.</i>

01:32:45.769 --> 01:32:47.354
<i>This might solve the mystery.</i>

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:48.647
<i>I've been waiting.</i>

01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:51.066
I've already given my heart to the cause!

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:52.859
<i>Without me, you'll all die.</i>

01:32:52.943 --> 01:32:54.695
I won't abandon anyone any more!

01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:56.655
<i>So fight with us!</i>

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:00.117
<i>With nothing to protect, you'll be strong.</i>

01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:02.327
<i>I want to know the truth about this world!</i>

01:33:02.411 --> 01:33:03.453
You'll die!

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:05.038
<i>You were chosen.</i>

01:33:05.122 --> 01:33:06.206
<i>You did that to your own son?</i>

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:07.291
Hurry, go!

01:33:07.332 --> 01:33:09.626
<i>As long as we've kept fighting,
we haven't lost!</i>

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:13.088
<i>It's hell outside the Wall!</i>

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:14.172
<i>You were always with me.</i>

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:15.507
Mikasa!

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.177
I've waited for this day!
