WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:02.519
Previously onDeputy...

00:02.560 --> 00:05.290
Asking me to look into an
LAPD case on your old buddy

00:05.350 --> 00:06.772
- ...is no small ask.

00:06.830 --> 00:08.650
I need you to understand
the political repercussions

00:08.700 --> 00:10.179
prior to inserting yourself

00:10.220 --> 00:11.699
into another agency's
investigation.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.911
I finally heard from the County,
and we're approved.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.870
We're officially qualified
to be foster parents.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.922
Are you serious?
You might be pregnant?

00:17.970 --> 00:20.530
I'm here to talk about something
that happened earlier today

00:20.580 --> 00:22.536
with the LAPD
and one of my deputies.

00:22.580 --> 00:24.138
I'm a sheriff's deputy.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.146
-My name is Joseph Harris.
-Down on the ground!

00:26.200 --> 00:27.326
BILL:
Turn around, Detective.

00:27.370 --> 00:29.326
Are you sure
this is how you want it?

00:29.370 --> 00:31.543
-BILL: Hey, honey.
-PAULA [over phone]:
There's a shooter.

00:31.590 --> 00:33.319
-Where's the gunman?
-You! Get off the phone.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.029
-Now!
-BILL [over phone]: Paula!

00:35.070 --> 00:37.413
There's not a manual
for how to save hostages

00:37.470 --> 00:38.767
when one's your wife, is there?

00:38.820 --> 00:39.889
MAGGIE:
Why is this happening?

00:39.950 --> 00:41.076
Is it because you're sheriff?

00:41.120 --> 00:42.519
I know that because I'm sheriff

00:42.560 --> 00:43.902
I'm in a position to stop them.

00:43.950 --> 00:45.258
I just want Mom to be okay.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.904
Me too, baby. Me too.

00:51.390 --> 00:52.391
BILL:
How long you been up?

00:53.960 --> 00:55.780
Is this our life now?

00:55.830 --> 00:56.910
Which part?

00:57.270 --> 00:58.305
This.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.448
[reporters chattering]

01:05.230 --> 01:06.367
You okay?

01:06.410 --> 01:07.968
Yeah. I'm just
trying to figure out

01:08.020 --> 01:09.885
if I'm gonna have to drive
through a wall of reporters

01:09.930 --> 01:11.750
every time I go to work
until you retire.

01:11.810 --> 01:12.936
BILL: NO.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.808
What happened at the jail
will be old news by tomorrow.

01:16.330 --> 01:17.672
It's not just that.

01:18.330 --> 01:20.764
First Luna.
Then the cop you arrested.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.243
And now this. It's you.

01:22.990 --> 01:24.036
You're the news.

01:25.690 --> 01:27.123
You sure you're okay?

01:28.820 --> 01:29.866
Yes.

01:31.350 --> 01:32.954
I have too much work not to be.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.217
NEWSCASTER [on TV]:
With the Santa Clarita fire

01:34.260 --> 01:35.659
only at five percent
containment,

01:35.700 --> 01:38.783
the Los Angeles Fire Department has enlisted the help

01:38.830 --> 01:41.173
of the Sheriff's Department
to evacuate residents...

01:41.790 --> 01:42.836
Are you going up there?

01:43.840 --> 01:46.274
If it comes to it, yeah.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.094
NEWSCASTER:
Officials are worried
about the winds picking up...

01:48.150 --> 01:49.447
What are they waiting for?

01:49.500 --> 01:51.149
Ugh. Ignore them.

01:51.190 --> 01:53.146
Just, let's have breakfast.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.326
I can't eat.

01:56.590 --> 01:57.716
I think I'm getting
the flu or something.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.505
PAULA: Hmm.
Do you wanna stay home?

02:00.550 --> 02:01.892
MAGGIE:
Yeah, I think so.

02:02.860 --> 02:04.987
Are they gonna
be here every day?

02:05.030 --> 02:06.588
Not every. Just for now.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.289
MAGGIE:
So, Mom gets held hostage

02:08.340 --> 02:10.160
and they trap us in the house?

02:10.210 --> 02:12.258
Why can't you just go back
to being a deputy?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.289
You are the boss, right?

02:15.170 --> 02:16.512
[cell phone buzzes]

02:17.740 --> 02:18.911
Ah, Bishop's here.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.786
They'll follow me, so you can
make your clean getaway.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.137
You're getting
pretty good at it.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.742
It'll get better, I promise.

02:29.230 --> 02:30.879
I know you
want that to be true.

02:30.930 --> 02:32.010
So do I.

02:32.410 --> 02:34.230
-I'll see you tonight.

Guys, come on, let's go.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.542
REPORTER 1: Sheriff Hollister,
how is your wife coping?

02:40.590 --> 02:42.194
BILL: _
None of your busrness.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.798
REPORTER 2: What's your plan
on dealing with the subpoena?

02:43.850 --> 02:45.374
Do you think going
up against the LAPD

02:45.420 --> 02:47.069
is gonna hurt your chances
for reelection?

02:48.030 --> 02:49.429
BILL: Every day
crimes are committed.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.559
Every day people struggle.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.200
I'm running a department
filled with deputies

02:54.260 --> 02:56.342
who wanna make
that struggle go away.

02:56.780 --> 02:57.860
Every day.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.777
Today's no different.

03:01.350 --> 03:02.863
So you wanna talk about that,
you know where to find me.

03:03.870 --> 03:05.349
You wanna talk about my wife,

03:05.880 --> 03:08.041
go stand on
somebody else's lawn.

03:09.530 --> 03:11.009
Thank you.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.709
You have any comments
on the Santa Clarita fire?

03:12.750 --> 03:13.921
There's more to come on that.

03:13.970 --> 03:15.528
[overlapping chatter]

03:23.370 --> 03:24.416
Hi.

03:25.370 --> 03:26.541
I'm headed out.

03:27.810 --> 03:30.199
I gotta go up to Santa Clarita.

03:30.940 --> 03:33.158
Organizing the evac
with all these fires.

03:33.770 --> 03:34.941
Okay.

03:34.990 --> 03:36.810
-So...
-So...

03:40.390 --> 03:41.948
[sighs] What do you say...

03:42.740 --> 03:43.729
we tell them tonight?

03:45.830 --> 03:46.910
I don't know.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.914
And it's not too soon?

03:49.310 --> 03:51.096
-For us or for them?
-Both.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.837
Wish things were
a little bit more... settled.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.097
You know, it's so early.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.186
Just don't wanna...

03:58.760 --> 04:00.182
get our hopes up again.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.142
Maybe we should wait

04:02.190 --> 04:05.409
until we know this is
really real.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.280
Hey, hey, hey. This is real.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.418
This baby's the one.

04:10.420 --> 04:11.455
I know it.

04:12.290 --> 04:13.416
I can feel it.

04:16.950 --> 04:19.339
A baby means you're gonna
get rid of us, doesn't it?

04:20.860 --> 04:21.940
[Teresa sighs]

04:27.220 --> 04:28.778
BISHOP: Department of
Psychological Services

04:28.830 --> 04:30.172

to sit down with you.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.266
BILL: Not a chance.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.264
LAPD's Criminal Investigation
Division called again.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.574
LAPD's taken up
enough of my time lately.

04:37.620 --> 04:38.746
What else?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.574
Media training
with the department's

04:40.620 --> 04:41.962
public relations
for interviews--

04:42.020 --> 04:43.317
Hard pass.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.009
You've put this off
three times, boss.

04:46.060 --> 04:47.459
This LAPD thing
is not going anywhere.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.580
Just catch and release.

04:48.630 --> 04:49.756
Or they'll keep coming
after you.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.414
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

04:51.460 --> 04:52.415
Do the training.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.506
-BILL: Next.
-Oy.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.020
Okay. Well, you're not gonna
like this one either,

04:56.070 --> 04:57.469
but I hear London is planning

04:57.510 --> 04:59.466
a huge fundraiser
for his campaign.

05:00.210 --> 05:01.245
Really?

05:02.380 --> 05:03.460
Good for him.

05:05.470 --> 05:06.471
You're okay with that?

05:07.210 --> 05:08.347
Ah, it's a free world.

05:08.390 --> 05:09.379
-If he wants--

05:16.490 --> 05:18.560
[indistinct chatter over radio]

05:19.920 --> 05:22.525
Not seeing a lot of fat
to trim around here.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.356
Can we just focus
on the task at hand, please?

05:25.410 --> 05:26.399
Put your arms up.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.239
I mean, how could
somebody expect

05:28.280 --> 05:30.180
you to make budget cuts when--

05:30.240 --> 05:31.491
[groans]

05:31.540 --> 05:33.326
Aren't you supposed to
make that hurt less?

05:33.370 --> 05:34.541
You bruised three ribs.

05:34.590 --> 05:35.898
Hurting less

05:35.940 --> 05:37.931
isn't gonna be
in your vocabulary for a while.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.200
How long is this gonna take?

05:41.250 --> 05:43.377
If you stop moving,
ten minutes.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.079
If not... forever.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.387
I'm sorry.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.386
It's just we have
a very full day.

05:49.430 --> 05:51.034
Yeah, not anymore you don't.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.126
Wait, what are you
talking about?

05:53.260 --> 05:55.387
I'm talking about a concussion,

05:55.440 --> 05:58.000
10-stitch laceration and you
mentioned back pain, correct?

05:58.050 --> 05:59.176
No, I'm-I'm fine.

05:59.220 --> 06:00.824
Well, we'll be
the judge of that.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.836
After a CAT scan
and a period of observation.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.915
Now hold still.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.999
Sheriff, you got that
budget meeting up first,

06:07.060 --> 06:08.357
-and then--
-I'm on It.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.479
Well, you say that now
but a day like this

06:09.540 --> 06:10.757
could easily be derailed.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.268
Bishop, just concentrate
on getting better.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.231
Me and the day,
we'll take care of ourselves.

06:16.150 --> 06:17.230
Yes, sir.

06:18.940 --> 06:21.374
[reporters chattering
indistinctly]

06:21.420 --> 06:22.933
CADE:
Hey, how you doin'?

06:22.990 --> 06:24.025
You all right?

06:24.070 --> 06:25.241
Yeah, I'll push through.

06:25.290 --> 06:26.416
How are the fires lookin'?

06:26.470 --> 06:28.426
It's bad.
It's comin' off strong.

06:28.470 --> 06:30.904
I was on my way out there
to help when I heard.

06:30.950 --> 06:32.292
How's Bishop?

06:32.340 --> 06:34.342
She got a concussion.
She'll be fine.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.694
What about you? You good?

06:36.740 --> 06:38.731
Me? [laughs] I'm good.

06:40.260 --> 06:41.306
You sure about that?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.652
CADE: Well, Teresa and I
are gonna have a baby.

06:45.620 --> 06:46.746
She's pregnant.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.488
Whew.
Congratulations, brother.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.097
Father of three.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.751
That's a pretty big deal.

06:55.450 --> 06:57.589
Fingers crossed, man.
It's still early on yet.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.715
Now Roberto thinks
us having a baby means

07:00.760 --> 07:02.933
we're not gonna want him
and Camilla around anymore.

07:04.330 --> 07:06.286
Well, nothing could be
further from the truth.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.109
Right?

07:09.600 --> 07:11.420
Everything's gonna work out
the way it's supposed to.

07:11.470 --> 07:12.812
[cell phone buzzing]

07:12.860 --> 07:14.464
All right, I'll handle
these clowns.

-All right.

TABNICK [over phone]:
Sheriff, it's Deputy Tabnick.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.436
Up in Angeles National Forest.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.732
-Hey.
-Can you hear me all right?

07:24.790 --> 07:27.566
I can. You working
fire evac, Tabnick?

07:27.620 --> 07:29.485
No, I'm southeast of the fires.

07:29.530 --> 07:30.610
I got something else.

07:31.010 --> 07:32.056
Lay it out.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.351
TABNICK:
Found a car up here.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.004
Came off Crest Highway.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.834
Driver's gone. Passenger too.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.051
There's blood on the scene,
so somebody got hurt.

07:39.540 --> 07:42.270
The VIN's removed
so I ran the plates.

07:42.330 --> 07:44.321
Looks like the car's
cold-plated.

07:44.370 --> 07:46.634
Now most of our guys
are working the evacuations.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.671
So I wouldn't have
called you directly

07:48.720 --> 07:51.336
but I just remembered what
they used to say about you.

07:51.860 --> 07:53.157
Oh, yeah? What's that?

07:53.210 --> 07:54.507
TABNICK: Bill Hollister
knows this forest

07:54.560 --> 07:55.811
better than the trees.

07:56.690 --> 07:58.169
Is that what they say?

07:58.210 --> 08:00.997
Yeah. And, look,
I'm smart enough to know

08:01.040 --> 08:02.769
what I don't know,
and I don't know these woods.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.127
Not like you.

08:04.170 --> 08:05.694
Well, I wish I could
take a run up there.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.048
I know, I know, I get it.

08:07.090 --> 08:09.217
Resources are stretched thin
with the fire

08:09.270 --> 08:10.658
and you being in charge.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.258
I just thought
it was worth a call.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.964
Well, I'll tell you
what I can do.

08:15.010 --> 08:16.875
I got somebody I can put on it.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.318
He can find the who of it.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.531
And then I can
send him your way.

08:19.580 --> 08:20.535
That sound good?

08:20.580 --> 08:21.888
Yeah, it does.
Thanks, Sheriff.

08:21.930 --> 08:24.535
I'm gonna pass you over
to Deputy Ward.

08:24.590 --> 08:25.579
TABNICK: Copy that.

08:26.460 --> 08:27.495
BILL: You're goin' up.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.286
This is Cade.

Hey, guys, come on In.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.559
Guys, there were like
a dozen reporters

08:38.600 --> 08:39.726
right outside my house.

08:39.780 --> 08:40.906
SUKI:
Yeah, you're like a celebrity.

08:40.950 --> 08:42.167
Oh, shut up.

08:42.210 --> 08:43.859
Feels extra naughty
ditching school

08:43.910 --> 08:45.389
with the sheriff's daughter.

08:45.430 --> 08:46.909
The sheriff's
famous daughter.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.348
As if.

08:48.390 --> 08:50.381
No, totally.
Own it, girl.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.263
You sure your folks
are gone like all day?

08:53.310 --> 08:55.221
They both work all the time.
We're good.

08:55.270 --> 08:58.398
We can play music,
watch movies,
eat whatever.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.268
Your parents have
a liquor cabinet?

09:05.240 --> 09:07.105
All right, canvass
all gas stations

09:07.150 --> 09:09.539
in La Caada,
La Crescenta, and Glendale.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.010
Approximate two-hour window
from the crash.

09:12.070 --> 09:14.800
We're looking for
a 1999 Pontiac Bonneville.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.979
-Can you pull that up, please?
-Yes, sir.

09:18.510 --> 09:19.898
Boom, looks like this.

09:20.340 --> 09:22.114
Any questions?
No?

09:22.170 --> 09:24.240
Good.
This may take a while.

09:28.130 --> 09:30.428
At my cousin's bat mitzvah,
they had an open bar.

09:31.090 --> 09:32.569
We scammed a bottle of Chablis.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.215
My cousin hooked up
with one of the waiters.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.305
Killer DJ, though.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.001
Yeah, that's-that's what
I'm thinking I should get.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.044
My parents want it to be
all traditional

09:41.100 --> 09:42.965
with a mariachi band.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.966
I'm like, no way,
this is my day.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.272
Are we really
gonna drink that?

09:49.020 --> 09:51.409
It's the only thing
my parents won't miss.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.620
Looks nasty.

09:52.670 --> 09:53.625
[gate closes]

09:53.680 --> 09:55.193
[pop music playing over stereo]

09:59.680 --> 10:01.022
MAGGIE: What the hell?

10:04.950 --> 10:06.292
What are you doing?

10:06.340 --> 10:08.296
I'm a member of the press.
See?

10:08.340 --> 10:10.251
So what?
This is private property.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.291
Well, I'm well within
my rights to record you.

10:12.690 --> 10:14.419
Sorry, stalking isn't legal.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.300
You're the daughter
of a public figure, so...

10:16.350 --> 10:18.306
Damn, you got paparazzi, Mags.

10:18.350 --> 10:19.339
At least he's cute.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.300
All right, I am not paparazzi.

10:21.350 --> 10:22.749
I'm a political correspondent
and I'm doing--

10:22.790 --> 10:23.916
I don't care
what you're doing.

10:23.970 --> 10:26.268
Now I'm asking nicely.
Please leave.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.799
Or I'm calling my father.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.406
Go ahead.

10:32.710 --> 10:33.881
You're supposed to be
at school, aren't you?

10:34.980 --> 10:36.322
I said stop, okay!

10:36.850 --> 10:38.010
Hey. What...

10:38.070 --> 10:39.150
[groans]

10:45.340 --> 10:47.376
[girls giggling]

10:48.340 --> 10:49.819

[keyboards clacking]

11:04.010 --> 11:05.432
[beeping]

11:12.540 --> 11:13.529
Sir.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.575
Right here.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.239
CADE:
You gotta be kidding me.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.713
All right, stop. Zoom in.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.246
That's it.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.505
All right, make sure
everybody gets this.

11:29.550 --> 11:31.506
Missing Persons,
Family Services, Juvie.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.903
I want BOLO out
to every station In LA.

11:33.950 --> 11:35.508
Now, if we don't get a hit
by the end of day,

11:35.560 --> 11:36.549
we'll take it statewide.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.646
WOMAN: Yes, sir.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.606
Who are you?

11:52.400 --> 11:53.799
[panﬁng]

12:12.030 --> 12:13.247
MAN [on phone]:
It's a hell of a situation.

12:13.290 --> 12:14.769
I might need
a larger response.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.378
Well, whatever you need.

12:16.430 --> 12:18.648
Airships. More deputies.

12:18.690 --> 12:20.464
MAN [on phone]:
More boots on the ground,
the better.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.738
Well, yeah, as long as
the wind doesn't pick up.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.384
MAN [on phone]:
Exactly. We're drawing
up a plan now.

12:24.430 --> 12:25.772
Keep me posted.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.252
MAN [on phone]:
Will do.
Thanks, Sheriff.

12:27.310 --> 12:28.607
[cell phone buzzes]

12:29.090 --> 12:30.136
What do you got?

12:30.180 --> 12:31.659
White male, mid 40s.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.099
Bad start.

12:33.140 --> 12:34.266
CADE [over phone]:
Yeah, him and a girl.

12:34.310 --> 12:36.039
Teenager.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.398
There's no VIN,
no sign of 'em at the car.
It's somethin'.

12:38.450 --> 12:40.441
Yeah. I'm on my way
up there right now.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.492
I got an airship
coming out of Riverside

12:42.540 --> 12:45.794
looking at most likely paths
of travel from the car,

12:45.850 --> 12:47.579
then starting a grid search.

12:47.630 --> 12:49.803
All right,
I'll update you from the scene.

12:52.110 --> 12:53.111
Damn it.

13:05.950 --> 13:06.951
[car door closes]

13:09.310 --> 13:10.379
Hey. Cade.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.302
Tabnick.
Thanks for coming up.

13:12.870 --> 13:14.826
Yeah. I saw those
fires driving up.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.132
Yeah, it's hard to believe
we are still 20 miles away.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.353
Imagine if it was
just over this ridge.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.480
Well, check this out.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.009
So, it could be

13:24.060 --> 13:26.142
that they brought
a dead pet up here to bury.

13:26.190 --> 13:28.499
Quicklime so the coyotes
won't dig it up.

13:30.890 --> 13:34.803
I had a cat that passed away
and I buried it in my baclqard.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.935
But I don't see a dead cat.

13:38.990 --> 13:40.378
So it's probably
not about that.

13:41.340 --> 13:42.329
You think?

13:43.730 --> 13:45.812
DAWN:
Media training is
important, Sheriff.

13:45.860 --> 13:47.464
If the press asks how
you're going to respond

13:47.520 --> 13:49.556
to crime on the Metro,
what do you say?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.913
Oh, we've implemented
a strict eye for an eye policy.

13:55.610 --> 13:58.568
This would all be less painful
if you just played along.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.871
I doubt that, but...

14:00.360 --> 14:01.657
I'll give it a try.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.189
I'm all yours.

14:03.790 --> 14:04.836
-[cell phone buzzes]
-Excuse me.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.349
Yeah. How we doin'?

14:07.410 --> 14:09.059
CADE [over phone]:
A deputy in Chatsworth
recognized her

14:09.100 --> 14:11.148
from a BOLO a ways back.

14:11.190 --> 14:12.885
Her name is Tulsa Vaughn.

14:12.930 --> 14:16.366
Missing for two years--
13 then, 15 now.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.890
And there's a bag of quicklime
in the trunk of the Bonneville

14:19.940 --> 14:21.373
along with a shovel.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.853
-Find her.
-CADE: You got it.

14:24.950 --> 14:26.019
DAWN:
Shall I continue?

14:26.080 --> 14:27.854
Yes, please. Sorry.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.595
Let's see how you do with
something more substantial.

14:30.650 --> 14:32.424
Sources close to the LAPD
have described

14:32.480 --> 14:33.993
the Sheriff's Department
as, quote,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.644
"Reckless cowboys."

14:36.260 --> 14:37.909
Now, Sheriff, the key
to answering questions

14:37.960 --> 14:40.736
is to answer with a question.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.615
-Hello?
-Oh, I'm here.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.392
Reckless? Never.

14:45.970 --> 14:48.188
Cowboys?
Hopefully, someday.

14:48.230 --> 14:49.265
DAWN: Good job.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.185
Now, the story
the LAPD will tell

14:51.230 --> 14:53.755
is that you bullied your way
into an investigation

14:53.800 --> 14:56.621
in a very public way
for your own benefit.

14:56.670 --> 14:58.365
I wouldn't call
the last few weeks,

14:58.410 --> 15:00.628
let alone the last few hours,
a benefit.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.715
No offense.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.930
None taken.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.288
We all have a job to do.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.505
You're right.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.286
And mine isn't in here.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.239
Not today.

15:11.820 --> 15:12.855
Why is that?

15:14.170 --> 15:15.159
Let me answer that question
with a question.

15:16.170 --> 15:18.081
Which is gonna make me
lose more sleep,

15:18.520 --> 15:20.909
wondering why I didn't help
find the missing girl

15:21.440 --> 15:22.919
or why I left a meeting early?

15:23.350 --> 15:24.829
Well, we both know the answer
to that question.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.782
We'll pick this up
another time, Dawn.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.089
Right now, someone
needs me up
in those mountains.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.442
PAULA:
Where's Genevieve?

15:37.500 --> 15:38.751
I sent her home.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.755
I'm fine.

15:39.800 --> 15:40.971
Plus, she was hovering.

15:41.630 --> 15:43.495
Aw. Sometimes
hovering can be nice.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.099
Can it though?

15:46.330 --> 15:49.595
Well, your blood levels,
kidney, liver, HDL--

15:49.640 --> 15:50.982
It's fine.

15:51.030 --> 15:52.816
PAULA:
There's a tick up
in your thyroid.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.813
-And a spike in your hormone--
-I said it's fine.

15:59.390 --> 16:00.778
Yeah.

16:00.820 --> 16:01.866
Yeah, it's all good.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.509
Great. So I can go?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.269
You are sounding more and more
like Bill every day.

16:07.310 --> 16:09.653
No, you need to get a CT scan,

16:09.700 --> 16:11.258
so we can make sure _
that you don't have anything

16:11.310 --> 16:12.481

16:12.920 --> 16:13.966
Isn't that Maggie?

[brakes squeal]

17:05.370 --> 17:06.405
Sheriff.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.198
Anything from the airship?

17:08.240 --> 17:10.140
Nothing other than
they're out there looking.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.849
Just started
going over the grid.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.504
I heard the winds
picked up though.

17:13.550 --> 17:15.586
It's pushing the fire south
straight towards us.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.508
I can smell it.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.939
We got no receipts,
no registration and no VIN.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.423
What about the engine number?

17:21.910 --> 17:22.899
Not yet.

What are you doing, Sheriff?

17:28.560 --> 17:29.697
BILL: Old cars like this,

17:29.740 --> 17:31.048
they usually have
the serial number

17:31.090 --> 17:32.648
on the bottom of the engine.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.389
[camera shutter clicks]

17:44.580 --> 17:45.569
Bingo.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.970
You run that through the DMV,

17:49.020 --> 17:50.055
you got your car owner.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.886
Cell phone service?

17:51.940 --> 17:53.066
Poor to none up here

17:53.110 --> 17:54.065
but I can patch you through

17:54.110 --> 17:55.190
to whoever on the sat phone.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.379
All right.
What else we got?

17:57.420 --> 17:59.024
Well, we got this blood trail

17:59.680 --> 18:00.806
and then it just stops.

Soft soil.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.520
It's a track trap.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.746
I'd say Tulsa went this way,
so did the driver.

Uh, filing reports.

I need to put you
and Joseph on something.

18:54.820 --> 18:55.957
You got us.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.433
I got an engine number
from a car.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.697
I need you to run it.

18:58.740 --> 19:00.526
Get a name and an address,
check it out.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.129
Okay. What are we looking at?

19:03.180 --> 19:04.784
An abducted girl.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.263
It's probably
the kidnapper's car.

-Ready?
-Go for it.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.847

about the fire, all right?

19:18.890 --> 19:19.970
I don't wanna get boxed in.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.009
Will do, Sheriff.

20:37.580 --> 20:38.569
no VIN,

20:39.970 --> 20:40.629
but our boy didn't realize
there's serial numbers

20:40.670 --> 20:42.626
on old engines, so...

20:43.110 --> 20:44.270
Roger Durbin.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.318
Works LAWP.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.015
Meter reader.

20:48.630 --> 20:49.938
No criminal record.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.930
JOSEPH:
Looks abandoned.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.504
Yeah, well,
looks ain't everything.

20:55.810 --> 20:57.289
WOMAN [screaming]:
Help! Please, help!

20:57.340 --> 20:58.295
[crying]

20:58.340 --> 20:59.853
Sheriff's Department!

21:00.340 --> 21:01.944
[woman screams]

21:13.960 --> 21:15.439
[woman screams]

21:20.490 --> 21:21.479
[woman groans]

21:21.540 --> 21:23.144
[panting] Thank the Lord.

21:23.190 --> 21:24.316
[crying]

21:24.370 --> 21:26.270
I thought no one would
ever ﬁnd us.

21:29.670 --> 21:31.979
[crying continues]

21:33.030 --> 21:34.065
[horse snorts]

21:46.820 --> 21:47.900
Whoa.

21:53.870 --> 21:55.087
[coughs]

22:00.660 --> 22:02.571
[groaning]

22:03.750 --> 22:05.229
You got a sucking chest wound.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.316
He's got a punctured lung.
He needs a chest seal.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.582
I gotta see if there's an exit.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.677
There's no exit.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.159
I got you.
Hang in there, all right?

22:17.200 --> 22:18.235
Hang in there.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.209
-CADE: Here you go.
-Hang in there. Hang in there.

22:26.510 --> 22:27.818
-You got it?
-CADE: Yep, yep, yep.

22:27.860 --> 22:29.077
All right, watch it.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.939
Lay down, brother,
lay down.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.266
All right, you got this?

22:47.320 --> 22:48.571
Yeah.
You're going after him?

22:48.620 --> 22:49.928
I'm goin' straight at him.

22:50.450 --> 22:51.758
They went that way.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.104
Leads right up over a ridge.

22:54.150 --> 22:56.061
What they don't know is
there's a shortcut this way.

22:56.110 --> 22:57.407
Dry creek bed.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.677
-Goes around.
-Right.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.062
Get there before them.

23:00.590 --> 23:03.150
Hit 'em head on.
I'm gonna radio medevac.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.024
You sure you don't wanna
wait for me?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.025
By the time we get him out,
come back,

23:08.080 --> 23:09.809
fire could be
all over the place.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.729
Besides, if Tulsa's alive,

23:12.300 --> 23:14.552
which I think she is,
she can't wait.

23:14.610 --> 23:15.861
so neither can I.

23:15.910 --> 23:17.468
[clicks tongue] Come on.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.838
[panﬁng]

23:37.150 --> 23:38.185
[grunting]

23:39.850 --> 23:41.363
-[Tulsa groans]
-Tulsa.

23:41.940 --> 23:42.975
Sweetie.

23:43.940 --> 23:45.453
Please don't be mad.

23:45.510 --> 23:46.499
ROGER: Mad?

23:47.640 --> 23:48.800
Why would I be mad?

23:49.640 --> 23:51.596
Mad about you
grabbing the steering wheel,

23:52.600 --> 23:54.113
making me crash my car,

23:54.950 --> 23:57.293
or making me fall
and hurting my leg.

23:57.950 --> 23:59.349
I'm not even mad...

24:00.130 --> 24:02.519
for you making me run
all this way.

24:03.310 --> 24:05.039
I just wanna know
what happened.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.784
I twisted my ankle.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.349
I bet you can still walk on it.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.492
You don't have to do
what you're gonna do. Okay?

24:19.540 --> 24:22.145
I will be good.
I will be better than good.

24:22.190 --> 24:23.191
Promise.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.548
ROGER:
I know you will.

24:25.150 --> 24:26.549
But it's not about that.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.068
You just got...

24:31.160 --> 24:32.331
too old.

24:33.420 --> 24:34.466
[sniffles]

24:36.030 --> 24:39.249
I'm not carrying you
all the way
up to the clearing.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.252
But you're gonna like it there.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.083
It's very pretty.

24:47.090 --> 24:48.170
Peaceful.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.357
Sound good?

24:53.700 --> 24:54.917
Sounds good.

24:56.270 --> 24:57.350
Come on.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.480
Help me up?

25:01.410 --> 25:03.184
-[groaning sharply]
-[Tulsa grunting]

25:06.410 --> 25:07.627
[Roger screams]

25:07.680 --> 25:08.931
-[gun cock
-Stop! 5]

25:10.070 --> 25:11.196
Go!

25:14.680 --> 25:15.635
Let's go.

25:20.250 --> 25:21.512
[dog barking]

25:21.560 --> 25:23.164
PAULA:
What's going on here, Maggie?

25:23.210 --> 25:24.381
I was harassed.

25:24.910 --> 25:26.161
That's what's going on.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.426
Yeah.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.868
I understand that.

25:30.610 --> 25:34.171
But the reason you were harassed
is you lied about being sick.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.699
I stood up for myself

25:35.750 --> 25:37.877
and did exactly what you
and Dad taught me to do

25:37.920 --> 25:40.525
and all you care about
is missing one day of school?

25:40.580 --> 25:44.357
Do I care that some creep was
basically stalking my daughter?

25:44.410 --> 25:45.832
Of course I do.

25:45.890 --> 25:47.926
But do I care about the fact
that you put yourself

25:47.980 --> 25:50.756
in a position that made it easy
for him to do so?

25:51.410 --> 25:53.014
Yes, I do.

25:53.070 --> 25:54.367
You wouldn't even know
I skipped school

25:54.420 --> 25:56.638
if it wasn't for
Dad's new job, so...

26:02.470 --> 26:04.904
We need to learn
to be strategic.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.550
We didn't sign up for this
but we are under the microscope.

26:10.260 --> 26:11.602
But it is what it is,

26:11.650 --> 26:14.471
and we can't change it
or what other people do.

26:14.520 --> 26:17.432
We can only control what we do.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.268
And what we do...

26:21.660 --> 26:23.093
what we've always done--

26:23.140 --> 26:25.574
Try as hard as we can
to do the right thing.

26:26.190 --> 26:27.578
I know.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.497
But I didn't ask
for all this stuff.

26:29.540 --> 26:31.588
Reporters and being watched.

26:31.630 --> 26:32.847
I know. I know.

26:33.850 --> 26:36.546
But life isn't always about
what you ask for.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.021
It's about what you're given.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.289
And what you do
with what you're given.

26:44.640 --> 26:45.595
Aye.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.074
[laughs] Nice try.

26:53.130 --> 26:54.256
-[doorbell dings]
-I'm grounded, I know,

26:54.300 --> 26:56.086
but do we have to tell Dad?

26:56.130 --> 26:57.119
[scoffs]

26:58.350 --> 26:58.953
I think you know the answer
to that one.

27:02.660 --> 27:04.139
Bishop. Hi.

27:04.530 --> 27:05.610
I thought you went home.

27:05.660 --> 27:06.615
I did.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.446
Are you okay?

27:08.490 --> 27:10.310
BISHOP: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Uh,ﬁne.

27:11.670 --> 27:14.491
I wanna talk
about what happened today.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.060
You were reading my chart,
I got angry and...

27:19.980 --> 27:21.629
I wanted to tell you why.

27:23.330 --> 27:24.809
I almost did earlier
butthen".

27:26.200 --> 27:29.078
I don't know, I thought you were
gonna judge me or something.

27:31.990 --> 27:34.163
I think judgment
is something people turn to

27:34.210 --> 27:35.336
when they're scared.

27:36.170 --> 27:37.990
Or they don't understand.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.082
I don't scare easy,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.651
and I would like more
than anything to understand

27:44.700 --> 27:45.826
what you're going through.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.655
Come in.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.834
Okay, I'm... I'm really sorry
for getting upset.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.369
You did not deserve that.

27:57.060 --> 27:58.846
You don't have to
apologize to me.

27:58.890 --> 28:00.403
You were just held hostage.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.974
I feel selfish
talking about my problems.

28:03.020 --> 28:04.544
Look, I got into medicine
to help people.

28:04.590 --> 28:07.195
So trust me when I tell you,
that helping you...

28:07.720 --> 28:09.199
helps me, too.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.242
It-it's...

28:12.770 --> 28:16.388
difficult for me
to talk about certain things.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.039
Biological things.

28:19.780 --> 28:20.769
PAULA: Of course.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.040
Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.708
Till recently,
I didn't have a word for...

28:33.050 --> 28:35.098
what I felt like on the inside.

28:37.100 --> 28:38.533
I let people assume.

28:38.580 --> 28:40.707
I didn't wanna make
anyone else feel uncomfortable,

28:41.630 --> 28:43.757
but that just
made me feel worse.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.626
You know, I hate labels.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.716
And here I am trying
to give myself one.

28:49.770 --> 28:50.714
PAULA: Hmm.

28:50.770 --> 28:52.499
Well, look, obviously,

28:53.120 --> 28:54.599
I understand biology.

28:55.510 --> 28:56.989
There are more than two sexes.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.554
I don't understand
all the layers of identity,

29:00.600 --> 29:02.773
but I do know, fundamentally,

29:03.910 --> 29:05.081
that not living one's truth

29:05.130 --> 29:07.257
is detrimental
to your psyche.

29:10.310 --> 29:13.006
And I don't wanna do that
to myself anymore.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.449
This_ accident
made It very clear

29:17.490 --> 29:20.095
_ that tomorrow
IS not a guarantee,

29:21.190 --> 29:22.441
and I need to be me.

29:26.630 --> 29:28.234
I'm getting closer every day

29:28.280 --> 29:30.623
to exactly what that is.

29:32.290 --> 29:34.542
But for now, I know...

29:37.810 --> 29:39.766
I'm not all woman.

29:49.570 --> 29:50.776
PAULA: Thank you...

29:51.870 --> 29:53.087
for trusting me with that.

29:53.130 --> 29:54.472
It must'ye_ been
very difficult

29:54.530 --> 29:56.134
to live with that for so long.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.266
[chuckles]
Thank you.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.969
I-I had no idea how badly

30:02.010 --> 30:03.830
I needed to say that to someone.

30:09.150 --> 30:11.493
I wish I knew it was gonna be
this easy with Genevieve.

30:12.410 --> 30:14.799
Well, you don't have to tell her
until you're ready.

30:14.850 --> 30:17.023
I am, but what if
she rejects me?

30:18.330 --> 30:19.376
Bishop...

30:20.340 --> 30:22.149
you are remarkable.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.292
I mean it.

30:24.340 --> 30:25.819
If Genevieve rejects you,

30:26.340 --> 30:28.388
she didn't deserve you
in the first place.

30:33.350 --> 30:36.171
If you don't wanna talk to us,
can you maybe give us your name?

30:39.400 --> 30:40.879
We can't get you home

30:40.920 --> 30:42.740
-if we don't have
any information.
-Here. Let me.

30:53.540 --> 30:54.711
Hi.

30:57.110 --> 30:59.158
We want you to know
that you're safe here.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.542
You don't have to be...

31:04.950 --> 31:06.554
His name's St. Michael.

31:13.650 --> 31:14.730
Maria.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.380
MINNICK:
What's that?

31:17.390 --> 31:18.561
That's my name.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.040
Maria.

31:35.410 --> 31:36.581
Roger kidnapped you.

31:38.150 --> 31:40.493
I'm no kid, but,
yeah, he took me.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.062
-From where?
-Bus station.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.377
He said he'd give me a ride

31:45.420 --> 31:46.591
'cause I was trying
to get to Ventura

31:46.640 --> 31:48.119
'cause I got people up there.

31:49.340 --> 31:50.591
Why you grillin' me?

31:51.770 --> 31:53.726
Just trying to
get things straight.

31:53.780 --> 31:55.463
What's not straight?
I was a prisoner.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.423
Is that what Maria would say,
that you were a prisoner?

32:00.780 --> 32:01.769
She talked to you?

32:03.090 --> 32:04.125
Yes.

32:05.610 --> 32:06.565
Oh.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.429
Well, that's good, then, right?

32:08.970 --> 32:09.914
It is.

32:14.450 --> 32:15.485
You know, Maria...

32:16.450 --> 32:17.439
her wrists.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.149
They're all cut and bruised
from the handcuffs.

32:21.720 --> 32:22.937
Yeah.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.546
Yours aren't.

32:26.980 --> 32:28.766
And according to
the County Clerk's office,

32:28.810 --> 32:30.937
Roger and Janet Wilcox

32:30.990 --> 32:33.072
were married
in Van Nuys in 2005.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.293
That's you, isn't it?

32:35.860 --> 32:37.031
That's your maiden name?

32:37.520 --> 32:38.999
Wilcox, right?

32:43.000 --> 32:44.160
I didn't want this.

32:45.570 --> 32:47.959
Not gettin' 'em,
not gettin' rid of 'em.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.048
What do you mean,
"Getting rid of them"?

32:52.230 --> 32:53.299
[slams table] Janet!

32:59.890 --> 33:01.494
He told me I was old.

33:04.020 --> 33:05.146
Used up.

33:08.850 --> 33:10.579
Started bringing home girls.

33:11.900 --> 33:13.117
And he treated 'em good.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.855
[laughs]
Everything but letting 'em go.

33:16.340 --> 33:17.853
But then once they got older...

33:19.730 --> 33:21.516
Roger did not like 'em old.

33:21.950 --> 33:23.121
[sniffles]

33:23.170 --> 33:24.683
That's when he would
take 'em up and...

33:26.870 --> 33:28.030
and go get another one.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.569
That's what happened to Tulsa?

33:29.610 --> 33:31.123
She got too old?

33:31.180 --> 33:32.522
Old and smart.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.609
Too smart for her own good.

33:36.530 --> 33:37.872
Where is up, Janet?

33:39.100 --> 33:40.351
Up in the woods.

What about Janet? She's old.

That's different
and you know it.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.234
[grunts] But... But...

33:55.200 --> 33:56.804
What if I was your new Janet?

33:57.730 --> 34:00.153
Okay? Like-like Maria's
your new me?

34:00.210 --> 34:01.859
Okay? I can be your new Janet.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.243
And I'll be so good.
I'll be better than Janet.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.165
I'll be so much better.
Please.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.166
I'm not gonna do that.

Maria's Maria,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.605
and you are you.

34:17.220 --> 34:18.778
Why don't you
just shoot me here?

34:19.750 --> 34:21.445
That's not how
it's supposed to be.

34:21.490 --> 34:23.219
You need to be
with those other girls.

34:24.580 --> 34:25.968
That's what I need to happen

34:26.020 --> 34:27.533

we're gomg to do.

[phone ringing]

34:35.160 --> 34:36.764
Need something, Janet.

34:36.810 --> 34:38.971
Something about where
Roger was taking Tulsa.

34:39.030 --> 34:40.247
Think.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.409
It's up in the woods.
That's all he told me.

34:42.470 --> 34:43.630
Oh, please.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.590
All these years,
all the other girls.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.244
You've been up there,
haven't you?

34:47.300 --> 34:49.996
No. He likes to be alone
with them when he says goodbye.

[slams table] Come on!

34:51.430 --> 34:52.738
Where is it?

34:52.780 --> 34:55.089
When he came home,
I know he said something!

34:55.830 --> 34:57.604
He-he loved the view.

34:59.180 --> 35:03.002
He said he liked the view
of the place with the peaks.

35:03.790 --> 35:05.269
Like horns.

35:05.710 --> 35:07.189
The horns of a demon.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.660
Two peaks like horns.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.790
Copy that?

35:14.370 --> 35:15.496
I know where he's going.

35:15.540 --> 35:16.882
Come on! Come on.

35:32.650 --> 35:34.868
Sorry, Tulsa.
This has to be done.

Are you all right?

36:30.570 --> 36:31.616
All right.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.442
I need you to be brave

36:33.930 --> 36:35.181
just a little bit longer, okay?

36:36.100 --> 36:37.886
You're gonna go find Roger.

Iam.

36:39.540 --> 36:40.529
TULSA: Okay.

36:41.630 --> 36:43.882
Okay. I'll be brave.

You never have to_be
scared of him again.

36:48.110 --> 36:49.543
I promise you that.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.937
I want you to stay put.
Stay right here.

All of 'em.

Tulsa maybe the most.

37:44.650 --> 37:46.254
But then they grew up,

37:46.300 --> 37:47.949
I didn't know
what to do with them.

37:48.780 --> 37:50.179
So I brought 'em here.

37:51.310 --> 37:52.959

I don't know
what the hell you are.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.017
We're gonna end this like men.

As I write this,

38:57.850 --> 39:00.193
I know full well that
my words are useless.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.724
They can't bring
your daughter back.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.205
They can't make sense of why.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.167
There is no why.

39:12.210 --> 39:15.509
It took me a long time
to figure that out.

39:15.570 --> 39:18.915
It's my job to bring closure,
so here it is--

39:18.960 --> 39:21.656
The man responsible
for these crimes is gone.

39:21.700 --> 39:22.951
The girl has been saved.

39:23.790 --> 39:25.269
And we would all like to thank

Sheriff's Department

39:28.100 --> 39:30.967
and everyone who has helped

that Tulsa is safe and sound

we're so thankful that we

Are they still awake?

40:50.140 --> 40:51.266
TERESA: N0.

40:51.310 --> 40:52.618
But I talked to them.

40:53.140 --> 40:55.188
I told 'em
they're a part of our family,

40:55.230 --> 40:56.663
and family is forever.

40:57.410 --> 40:58.445
So...

40:58.890 --> 41:00.141
I think we're okay.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.365
Good.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.474
Your job, being my daughter,

41:31.530 --> 41:34.829
has to do with putting up
with me and my job.

41:36.050 --> 41:37.187
And doin' the right thing.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.182
Telling the truth.

Goin' to school every day.

41:43.190 --> 41:44.669
But you know that already.

41:46.850 --> 41:48.101
We've grounded you,

41:49.720 --> 41:52.507
and you're way too smart
to make the same mistake twice.

41:53.940 --> 41:55.896
So let me just say
what I really wanna say.

41:58.030 --> 41:59.372
A guy was bothering you.

42:00.030 --> 42:01.201
You made him stop.

42:01.910 --> 42:02.945
That sum it up?

42:07.300 --> 42:09.291
On the end of the day,
that's what counts.

42:10.610 --> 42:12.043
I did what needed to be done,

42:12.090 --> 42:13.398
I came home safe.

42:14.570 --> 42:15.559
So did you.

42:17.620 --> 42:20.578
And I'm sorry that my job
is hard on you,

42:20.620 --> 42:21.700
on the both of you.

42:22.710 --> 42:23.927
I didn't ask for it

42:24.710 --> 42:25.699
and neither did you.

42:28.410 --> 42:29.968
But I can't do it without you.

42:31.810 --> 42:33.277
So I was wondering

42:34.900 --> 42:36.674
if maybe we could
start thinking about
whether my new job

42:36.720 --> 42:39.063
is something we might
be able to get used to.

42:44.820 --> 42:46.299
And one more thing, Mags.

42:47.730 --> 42:48.901
What's that?

42:50.080 --> 42:51.126
I'm proud of you.
