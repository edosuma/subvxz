WEBVTT

00:15.390 --> 00:18.508
Agent Graves. Sergeant Phalen,
State Police. We spoke on the phone.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.766
- Yes, sir.
- This way.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.975
- So when did this happen?
- Just after 6 last night.

00:23.148 --> 00:27.233
Young couple staying at the lodge went
out for a hike, strayed off one of the trails.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.894
Bradford P.D. got the call after 7,
notified us.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.734
Anyone spoken to the press?

00:31.907 --> 00:35.696
Responding officer and guys from Troop P
are the only ones who've seen the site.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.201
Some are shook up.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.704
- Think it could be him?
- I sincerely doubt that.

00:39.873 --> 00:44.743
But if it is, and you need my department
to issue a BOLO or set a perimeter...

00:51.969 --> 00:53.710
It's him, right?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.970
- I mean, who else?
- Issue that BOLO.

00:56.139 --> 01:00.133
Have your men set a perimeter.
Circulate that sketch we have on file.

01:02.229 --> 01:06.143
Hey, do me a favor. There's an agent
I need you to find right away.

01:06.316 --> 01:09.775
She's out of D.C.
Name's "Elizabeth Keen."

01:36.972 --> 01:39.760
<i>He went to his funeral.
He was a pallbearer.</i>

01:39.933 --> 01:41.720
- A pallbearer.
- While he did that...

01:41.893 --> 01:45.227
...a witness came forward
who saw Garvey kill Singleton.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.024
Now, the killer.
Can you describe him to me?

01:50.193 --> 01:52.105
He had glasses.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.395
Black glasses.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.189
Well, I saw Garvey kill Tom.
A lot of good that did me.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.825
I've referred Garvey's case
to the Marshal's Office of Internal Affairs.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.033
And now this. It's a big break.
It's okay to get your hopes up.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.619
You've spoken to this witness?
Is he credible?

02:05.792 --> 02:09.160
- Because if he is, then my testimony...
- Will also be credible.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.456
Any questions about your memory
will go away.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.296
- So will Mr. Garvey.
- And you want that?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.502
Not until I get what I want.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.046
I told them about the duffel bag.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.512
Garvey provides protection
for the Nash Syndicate.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.392
I know some of the players.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.726
I'll shake them loose
while the task force questions the witness.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.188
- Where is he? Can I question him?
- He's not here. No.

02:32.361 --> 02:35.775
- This is Tom's killer.
- Which is why you can't be involved.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.234
Defense would need a minute
to convince a jury...

02:38.408 --> 02:41.242
...to disregard any part of a case
you build against Garvey.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.904
You're the widow and star witness.
You can't be the investigating officer.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.745
While you and Red go after him,
I'm supposed to what...

02:47.918 --> 02:49.784
- ...read a book?
- Actually, I have a case.

02:49.961 --> 02:54.205
I'm interested in the man who murdered
Tom and the secret that killed him.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.376
I'm gonna help with the former
and prevent the latter.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.886
Fifty-fifty split. Like a good divorce.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.092
Harold...

03:05.143 --> 03:07.009
- About the case...
- Pass.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.894
Agent Keen...

03:09.064 --> 03:13.058
...this came directly from Quantico,
they specifically requested you.

03:13.235 --> 03:18.026
Said it's a cold case you're familiar with.
Someone called the "Capricorn Killer."

03:18.907 --> 03:19.943
Sound familiar?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.025
- Yeah, it does.
- Good.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.616
Because I told them they have
the full support of you and this task force.

03:25.789 --> 03:30.534
Reddington and I will stay on Garvey,
but I need you to tell us about Capricorn.

03:30.711 --> 03:34.421
His first victim was a female college
professor found in Tacoma in 2010.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.707
Cause of death was ligature strangulation.
Staging was disturbing.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.800
So much, we believe
there's religious or cult affiliation.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.341
Then, six months later,
it happened again.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.807
In Memphis, and Charlotte, Idaho Falls.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.643
Seven victims in four years.

03:52.816 --> 03:56.025
Each one found in remote,
inhospitable environments...

03:56.194 --> 03:58.902
...and each one strangled
and posed in place...

03:59.072 --> 04:01.314
...using a hand-forged sword...

04:02.075 --> 04:04.362
...and holding the skull of a horned goat.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.369
Hence the name "Capricorn."
Sign of the goat.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.412
<i>This astrological symbol
also represents a creature...</i>

04:11.585 --> 04:14.123
<i>...whose natural ability
allows them to survive...</i>

04:14.296 --> 04:18.916
...in inhospitable environments.
It also characterizes panic and fear.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.084
Agent Keen. Brandon Graves,
Pittsburgh Field Office.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.299
- Ressler and Navabi.
- This way.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.760
Your profile.
It was different from the others?

04:26.933 --> 04:30.051
Slightly. We all agreed
the UNSUB was likely a white male...

04:30.228 --> 04:32.515
...forties, small in stature,
and well-organized.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.271
He was transitory.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.977
A long-haul trucker...

04:36.151 --> 04:39.269
...or some other blue-collar job
that required travel.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.779
That movement gave him confidence.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.407
So much so that his killings accelerated
at an alarming rate.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.320
- I thought he would stop.
- He did. Went silent.

04:48.497 --> 04:51.535
The Bureau thought he was dead
or had been arrested.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.950
- Until today.
- How is your theory different?

04:54.127 --> 04:57.962
Well, his killings accelerated so quickly,
I thought he'd feel out of control...

04:58.131 --> 04:59.963
...hold back, go dormant for a while.

05:00.133 --> 05:04.173
Others thought he had stopped.
I thought he would return.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.087
Which he has.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.880
Appears to fit the MO:

05:08.058 --> 05:10.801
ligature strangulation, remote dump site...

05:10.977 --> 05:13.264
...methodical, ritualistic.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.645
It's impressive.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.647
You were right.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.114
Keen, what is it?

05:25.283 --> 05:26.569
This sword.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.409
The Capricorn Killer forged
each by hand...

05:32.582 --> 05:35.996
...and this one looks symmetrical.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.876
Lacks imperfections.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.505
Notify the lab, have them pull weapons
from past victims...

05:41.675 --> 05:44.543
- ...and run a comparison.
- Hold on. This isn't a random act.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.133
Whoever did this has details right
that weren't released to the public.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.548
- This is Capricorn.
- Maybe.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.474
Maybe not.

05:52.644 --> 05:55.637
Maybe this is the work of a copycat.

05:55.814 --> 05:59.558
Standing there looking at that body,
I felt alive.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.896
You reconnected with your work,
with profiling.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.107
No, it's more that...

06:04.990 --> 06:07.528
- I don't know.
- Why are you editing yourself?

06:08.076 --> 06:10.739
This only works if you're entirely open.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.450
You brought up Capricorn
for a reason. Why?

06:13.623 --> 06:14.909
Because...

06:15.083 --> 06:18.576
...what this UNSUB did
to that poor man in the woods...

06:18.753 --> 06:20.540
...part of me...

06:20.714 --> 06:25.300
Sometimes, I feel like I'm capable
of doing terrible things like that.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.755
You said you identified the man
who killed Tom.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.171
Yes, killing him.
Picturing that. Imagining that.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.261
We've talked about
how common that feeling is.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.347
This is different.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.560
Well, we've talked about your anger
and passion...

06:39.733 --> 06:42.441
...and your desire
to paint outside the lines.

06:42.611 --> 06:46.104
Your first case with the Bureau,
what was it called?

06:46.281 --> 06:48.694
He took their shoes...
The Sandman Killer.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.570
My work on that case was classified.
How do you know about it?

06:53.747 --> 06:57.957
Elizabeth, it's my job
to evaluate your readiness.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.742
We can't have secrets.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.834
The Sandman was a very important
unsolved case early in your career.

07:04.382 --> 07:08.046
I'm sure it was defining in ways
you may not even be aware of.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.802
Unsolved cases.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.967
I fixate on them.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.930
How unfair they are
that people get away with murder.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.434
I know it sounds corny, but I...

07:21.566 --> 07:24.980
I obsess over the need for justice.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.314
Even if it means
painting outside the lines.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.108
- Or the law.
- Yes.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.451
A witness has come forward
who can identify Singleton's killer.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.493
He's at Belmont P.D.
I want him in protective custody...

07:41.670 --> 07:45.209
- ...and transferred here for questioning.
- Protective custody?

07:45.382 --> 07:48.375
We believe the detective was murdered
by Ian Garvey.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.793
A U.S. marshal responsible
for killing Tom Keen.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.588
Wait, wait. You know who killed Tom,
and it was a cop?

07:53.765 --> 07:57.805
Because Garvey is a U.S. marshal,
I want the FBI to protect the witness.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.561
I arranged for you to meet agents
from the D.C. office.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.565
Soon as you sign the transfer, they are
to bring him here as quickly as possible.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.568
- Understood?
- No. I mean, yes, sir, about the transfer.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.855
But about Tom, why would
a U.S. marshal want him dead?

08:11.032 --> 08:13.445
Tom was pursuing
a duffel bag containing a secret...

08:13.618 --> 08:15.530
...Reddington is keeping
from Agent Keen.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.412
Garvey took it
and killed Tom in the process.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.060
- What the hell?
- Have a seat, Gerald.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.851
You and I are gonna make a little video.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.529
Hey, welcome back, Gerald.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.455
Hey. Turn it down, you hear me?
It's the manager.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.378
You gotta turn that damn thing off.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.124
Mr. Reddington.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.009
My word is my bond.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.848
My currency.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.768
I gave Peter Caras my word
that I'd move him...

09:26.941 --> 09:31.481
...before the Nash Syndicate learned
that he'd cut a deal with the feds.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.400
But that didn't happen,
did it, Mr. Gabinelli?

09:35.075 --> 09:38.989
The Syndicate found him here.
Killed him in this very room.

09:39.162 --> 09:43.031
At the time, you gave me your word...

09:43.208 --> 09:45.450
...that you had no idea
how that happened.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.868
I didn't. I don't.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.957
Mr. Caras was a federal witness.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.713
I didn't give it a second thought
when the marshals...

09:51.883 --> 09:54.375
...sent Garvey to investigate his murder.

09:54.552 --> 09:58.717
But now I know Garvey wasn't here
to investigate the murder, was he?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.098
He came to cover it up.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.054
You betrayed me to Garvey.

10:03.228 --> 10:07.939
So now, as absolution,
you're going to betray Garvey to me.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.849
Please, he's a U.S. marshal.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.609
And I am but a humble killer with a gun...

10:12.779 --> 10:17.240
...pointed at the withered prune
that passes for your heart.

10:17.408 --> 10:21.118
The next time an associate
of the Nash Syndicate shows up...

10:21.287 --> 10:24.997
...I want a phone call,
a room number and a key.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.623
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.376
Turn the lights off on your way out.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.721
Excuse me. Hello there.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.722
I'm here about Tony Mejia.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.680
- What about him?
- Oh, I've got signed transfer orders.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.180
Agents from the D.C. Field Office
should be here any minute.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.441
He's an eyewitness in the death
of a police officer.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.319
Norman Singleton.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.104
That's right.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.740
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you know him?

10:59.909 --> 11:04.370
I did, briefly in passing.
He seemed like a good man.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.030
Ran it up the flagpole.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.496
Afraid you can't question the witness.
Feds cut in line.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.331
I'm sorry, I... I thought you...

11:11.504 --> 11:14.463
Ian Garvey, U.S. Marshals.
Singleton was on my task force.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.342
Federal Agent Mojtabai.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.797
- What did you say your name was?
- Look, I get it.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.341
You got dibs. Protocol.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.054
This is personal.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.594
I'm... I'm sure it was.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.478
Good, so we understand each other.

11:30.648 --> 11:34.141
You give me your card, and I'll send you
a transcript of the interrogation.

11:34.319 --> 11:38.154
I'm afraid I cannot let you do that,
send me a transcript that is.

11:38.323 --> 11:42.818
You won't have to because the witness,
I'm putting him in protective custody.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.360
Are you, now?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.529
And who would you be
protecting him from?

11:47.332 --> 11:48.868
Who?

11:50.168 --> 11:52.581
I'm just... I'm just doing as I was told.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.748
I'm telling you this is personal, I'd like you
to extend me professional courtesy.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.211
I would if I could.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.626
Really.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.669
Okay, then.

12:04.557 --> 12:08.676
How about we go outside?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.061
I kick your scrawny brown ass...

12:11.231 --> 12:12.938
...and then take my witness.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.851
First of all, it's more of a golden brown.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.894
Topaz. Topaz, really.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.782
And secondly, pardon my French,
but you can back the hell off.

12:22.951 --> 12:26.410
- Please bring out my witness.
- I was told you were waiting for agents...

12:26.579 --> 12:29.367
- ...from the D.C. Field Office?
- Yes, I was.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.247
Not anymore.

12:36.172 --> 12:40.542
Miss Seivers, your husband's body
was found almost 250 miles away.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.927
Can you think of any reason at all
why he'd be so far from home?

12:44.097 --> 12:48.011
- Don't know. He didn't like to travel.
- Did he have friends in Pennsylvania?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.425
Not that I know of.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.470
But you feel like your husband
was open with you?

12:52.647 --> 12:56.231
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm getting a picture of your husband.

12:56.401 --> 12:59.519
Steady job, known in the community,
high-school football star.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.234
I believe
what Agent Graves is getting at is...

13:02.407 --> 13:05.775
...your husband doesn't fit
the victimology of our killer.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.491
Wendel had a family,
he was known here in town.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.202
He was strong, could fight back.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.332
Well, I'm sure he did.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.163
Look...

13:16.754 --> 13:18.336
...we had problems.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.045
Fought just like anyone,
but Wendel was a good man.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.301
He loved me, and he loved that boy.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.382
This picture of the two of them.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.390
- Was it a school project?
- No, they was just messing around.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.721
That's one of Wendel's hobby swords.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.262
I'm sorry. "Hobby swords"?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.898
- He made these?
- Sure.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.148
In his shop out back.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.954
Isn't it odd
that the Capricorn Killer's last victim...

13:52.123 --> 13:54.490
...has his own sword-making operation?

13:55.543 --> 13:58.627
They're hand-forged. Imperfect.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.723
You're saying the most recent victim
is the Capricorn Killer?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.805
Someone murdered him
and mimicked his MO in the process.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.847
It's him. We have shrines that match
each of the Capricorn Killer's victims.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.937
The profile? I thought you said
this guy was single. A loner.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.854
<i>He was. Until he met his wife
and had a child.</i>

15:06.030 --> 15:07.487
That's why he went dormant.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.196
Family. I'm telling you, you pull
the travel records from his employer...

15:11.369 --> 15:13.952
...and they will match
the dump sites of his victims.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.454
Then who killed Seivers?

15:15.623 --> 15:18.536
Keen was right about the sword.
It wasn't hand-forged.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.417
It was a bronze cast made
by a history professor...

15:21.587 --> 15:24.045
<i>- ... who sells them online.</i>
- Any info on the buyer?

15:24.215 --> 15:27.379
It was purchased under alias,
but I tracked down a shipping address.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.590
Run it down with Ressler. Keen,
you may wanna find your way back.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.177
Our witness in the Singleton murder
is en route as we speak.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.806
- You disgust me, Gerald.
- No.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.441
Please. I... I... I...

15:44.610 --> 15:47.068
Don't pass out on me now.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.356
Sadly, I got a lot more work to do.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.316
Just like you did.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.741
Hey, welcome back, Gerald.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.327
I can't imagine what you're feeling.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.409
<i>Not physically, but emotionally.</i>

16:02.587 --> 16:05.250
<i>Funny thing is, the drugs I gave you
to immobilize you...</i>

16:06.674 --> 16:09.041
...don't have any effect on fear.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.461
<i>That's what makes
this experience so unique.</i>

16:12.638 --> 16:13.879
<i>While you were asleep...</i>

16:14.056 --> 16:17.424
<i>...I took the liberty
of amputating your forearm...</i>

16:17.894 --> 16:21.934
<i>...by making an incision at the juncture
between the ulna and humerus.</i>

16:22.523 --> 16:25.186
<i>I opened the fascial plane
in your left leg...</i>

16:25.359 --> 16:29.399
<i>...being careful to avoid
the femoral artery.</i>

16:29.947 --> 16:31.654
<i>Now lie back, Gerald.</i>

16:31.824 --> 16:33.406
<i>Be brave.</i>

16:33.576 --> 16:37.445
<i>Let's enjoy
these last few moments together.</i>

16:56.432 --> 16:58.765
Stop. FBI.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.785
He didn't make it.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.467
I know you're scared.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.799
I would be too.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.928
Being here, of what you saw.

17:40.101 --> 17:44.562
But you know you don't have to be.
We're here to protect you. It's our job.

17:44.730 --> 17:50.067
And the people I work with, they're, like...
They're, like, really, really good at it.

17:50.236 --> 17:53.195
<i>All right, so now I'm gonna show you
some photos.</i>

17:53.364 --> 17:55.356
<i>The woman already showed me
some photos.</i>

17:55.533 --> 17:57.525
<i>Yes, of the victim.
Of Detective Singleton.</i>

17:57.702 --> 18:02.117
But these photos contain the man
who we believe killed Detective Singleton.

18:02.290 --> 18:06.125
And if you recognize him,
I want you to point him out, okay?

18:08.462 --> 18:09.873
Okay.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.456
All right, take your time.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.467
<i>The man you saw in the alley.</i>

18:16.804 --> 18:20.343
The man you saw murder
Detective Singleton.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.638
Do you see that man
in any of these photos?

18:37.158 --> 18:39.320
I'll reach out to the U.S. Attorney's office.

18:39.493 --> 18:44.363
Soon as he hears this, I have no doubt
he'll issue an arrest warrant.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.657
It's almost over.

18:48.586 --> 18:49.622
You have someone?

18:50.129 --> 18:53.247
I put him in Room 4, where Caras died.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.167
I thought it would be poetic justice.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.631
A romantic, how counterintuitive.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.135
I hope you appreciate the risk
I'm taking by doing this.

19:02.308 --> 19:06.348
It's not so much appreciation
as good planning.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.684
Kill the bodyguard, wound Reddington.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.065
I need him alive.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.803
You're gonna need a colostomy bag.

19:41.972 --> 19:45.215
- You deserve worse.
- I should kill you right now.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.806
Let's talk about what you're going to do.

19:47.978 --> 19:51.392
Which is name your price, and quickly,
before policemen who actually...

19:51.565 --> 19:54.774
...uphold the law arrive
to clean up this mess.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.355
Start with the truth.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.942
You have the bones. You know the truth.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.858
A truth. I want the whole truth.

20:02.034 --> 20:06.074
The whole truth is that we're all clinging
to a lovely blue ball...

20:06.247 --> 20:08.364
...floating in a sea of blackness.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.535
Everything else, including, and most
especially, the truth you're looking for...

20:12.712 --> 20:16.046
...is a tale told by an idiot
full of sound and fury...

20:16.215 --> 20:18.002
...signifying nothing.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.632
I could take the bones public.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.169
You could, but you haven't,
and you won't.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.806
I'm not sure why.
There's something I'm missing.

20:25.975 --> 20:30.140
Something holding you back.
I won't kill you until I have the bones.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.726
And for some inexplicable reason,
you won't go public...

20:33.899 --> 20:36.391
...until you know this whole truth.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.444
We may have a stalemate,
but with the FBI...

20:39.613 --> 20:42.196
...you're at a distinct disadvantage.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.948
They're hunting for you.

20:44.118 --> 20:48.112
And as you've killed a cop,
they will make it their life's work...

20:48.289 --> 20:50.155
...to put you on death row.

20:50.332 --> 20:54.952
Unless you give me the bag, in which
case, an accommodation may be possible.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.963
- That's my offer.
- Here's mine.

20:58.132 --> 21:02.547
The cop you say I killed,
the FBI's holding a witness.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.303
- Bring him to me.
- Why would I do that?

21:05.473 --> 21:09.467
If he fingers me, and I go to prison,
our little stalemate ends.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.639
Wanna keep the bones secret?

21:11.812 --> 21:14.896
That witness can never see
the inside of a courtroom.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.681
You better go.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.940
I got a crime scene to investigate.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.072
The Tri-State Butcher himself.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.484
We got an ID from the license
and card in his wallet.

21:27.661 --> 21:32.622
Local P.D. went to his house and found
a stash of tapes from previous victims.

21:32.792 --> 21:38.208
So we have two serial killers,
both killed using their unique signature.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.876
Where's your head?

21:44.053 --> 21:46.636
The profile, whoever's behind this,
I don't get it.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.765
What's not to get?
Someone's knocking off serial killers.

21:49.934 --> 21:50.970
Yeah, but how?

21:51.143 --> 21:54.261
Most serial killers are white men
in their 40s.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.646
The man Ressler chased down
was black.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.183
And how is he identifying his targets?

21:59.360 --> 22:02.524
The victims are all killers
the Bureau can't identify.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.688
Yet, the crimes are premeditated...

22:05.241 --> 22:08.405
...and the crime scenes
are meticulously staged.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.910
He's duplicating work of real-life killers...

22:11.080 --> 22:14.323
...using classified intel
that hasn't been made public.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.116
Inside information.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.121
- He's gotta be...
- Don't say it.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.755
You're thinking it too.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.382
A cop?

22:25.052 --> 22:27.009
Not just a cop.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.347
- A profiler.
- You think the UNSUB...

22:30.516 --> 22:34.100
...is an African-American profiler
with the Bureau?

22:34.937 --> 22:36.974
I'd think I was under suspicion...

22:37.147 --> 22:40.561
...but you didn't mention
he was devastatingly handsome.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.938
It makes perfect sense.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.853
What makes you so sure?

22:46.323 --> 22:49.407
Because this is exactly
how I would've done it.

22:51.036 --> 22:55.451
- I've been trying not to edit myself.
- Tell me, how has that felt?

22:55.624 --> 22:58.788
Intense. Scary.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.998
Everyone feels that way sometimes.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.914
- You don't have to be afraid.
- That's just it.

23:04.091 --> 23:08.176
That's what scares me.
I'm not afraid of those feelings.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.253
I'm exhilarated by them.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.298
This killer is a genius.

23:13.475 --> 23:17.640
He saw things the Bureau couldn't.
He solved cases we missed.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.188
You always felt like this?

23:20.733 --> 23:21.974
I think so.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.643
My first case, the Sandman,
the one you asked me about.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.856
How did he do it?

23:26.030 --> 23:30.195
Convince little Susie Baker to leave
with him in the middle of the night.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.110
- You think he convinced her?
- Her shoes were missing.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.030
Little pink high-tops with rainbow laces.

23:36.206 --> 23:39.324
Why would a 4-year-old put them on
or let him put them on for her?

23:39.501 --> 23:41.493
She did it because she trusted him.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.454
And I could never figure out why.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.540
What he did...

23:47.509 --> 23:48.966
...what they all do.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.423
It sickens me.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.338
But how they do it...

23:53.515 --> 23:56.132
...how their minds work...

23:56.310 --> 23:58.893
- ...honestly, it's...
- Exhilarating?

23:59.063 --> 24:02.227
Like this case I'm working on right now,
the profiler...

24:02.399 --> 24:04.516
- Alleged profiler.
- No. I'm certain.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.980
So you've argued.
If the killer is a profiler...

24:07.154 --> 24:10.363
...then his training at Quantico
would've required a psych eval.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.240
I like to think I or my colleagues
would've flagged him...

24:13.410 --> 24:15.902
- ...before he was cleared.
- Maybe you did.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.790
- What?
- Flag him. Not at first, but maybe later.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.622
<i>Years later, they could've suffered
a mental trauma.</i>

24:22.795 --> 24:24.832
<i>One that caused a psychological shift.</i>

24:25.005 --> 24:27.543
If I could get the medical records
of these profilers...

24:27.716 --> 24:30.003
But you can't.
Medical records are private.

24:30.177 --> 24:34.968
Without the authorization of the patient
or a court order, you can't get them.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.347
Of course I can get them.

24:36.517 --> 24:40.887
Dr. Fulton is incredibly perceptive.
She sees me, sees through me.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.726
If the killer's a profiler,
her and her colleagues...

24:43.899 --> 24:46.016
...would see through him,
enough to flag him.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.435
Send the list,
you'll have records this afternoon.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.399
Do I even wanna know how?

24:50.572 --> 24:52.905
I'm sure you do,
but I'm not gonna tell you.

24:53.075 --> 24:56.443
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.
The witness ID'd Garvey as the killer.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.610
- Did he?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

24:57.788 --> 25:00.997
<i>The sweet innocent kid
anyjury would believe.</i>

25:01.166 --> 25:03.032
And you have him in protective custody?

25:03.210 --> 25:06.328
Completely. Aram is overseeing
his transport to a safe house now.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.465
He'll have round-the-clock security
until the trial. Garvey is going down.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.172
If not for killing Tom, for killing a cop.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.136
I want all this to be behind you.

25:16.682 --> 25:20.050
For the first time,
I actually think that might happen.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.642
Dembe, is everything in place?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.978
Yes. Everything is in place.

25:38.078 --> 25:42.163
I know I was just here this morning,
but I need to ask you something.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.415
- Get your opinion.
- Of course, what?

25:44.585 --> 25:47.419
I've been looking over the medical files
of other profilers.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.752
- We talked about this.
- That's when I got the idea to do it.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.586
I told you they were classified.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.468
- I've looked over them for hours.
- The files you stole?

25:55.637 --> 25:57.845
I had started to suspect Graves.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.507
<i>The files didn't confirm my suspicions.</i>

26:00.684 --> 26:05.770
Of the 282 agents in the Bureau's
five Behavioral Analysis Units...

26:05.939 --> 26:09.307
...sixty-one have undergone
psychological evaluations...

26:09.485 --> 26:14.401
...but in the last 10 years, only eight
have been deemed unfit for duty...

26:14.573 --> 26:16.280
...and released.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.568
Agent Graves was not one of them, but...

26:19.745 --> 26:21.236
...Anthony Hollis was.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.575
<i>Top in his class at Quantico...</i>

26:23.749 --> 26:27.368
...deemed unfit after a psych eval
due to insubordination.

26:27.544 --> 26:30.082
Why are you telling me this
and not your task force?

26:30.255 --> 26:33.373
He got into law because his parents
were killed when he was young.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.384
I think you're telling me
because you can't tell your team.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.011
- He's angry. Driven.
- Do you wanna lose your badge...?

26:39.181 --> 26:41.889
I wanna stop a serial killer,
and I think you can help me.

26:42.059 --> 26:45.223
In your professional opinion,
as a psychologist and criminologist...

26:45.395 --> 26:49.685
...do you think, based on everything
I've told you, that this could be our guy?

27:02.412 --> 27:04.028
Yes, it's possible.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.539
- That's all I need to know.
- Liz...

27:18.595 --> 27:20.837
I may have identified the man
behind the killings.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.006
A former agent. Name's "Anthony Hollis."

27:23.183 --> 27:25.266
- What makes you so sure?
<i>- He was a profiler.</i>

27:25.435 --> 27:27.722
Psych Services flagged him
for behavioral issues.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.764
- It's all in his medical file.
- "Anthony Elliot Hollis.

27:30.941 --> 27:35.060
Age, 46, residence,
231 Washington Street in Gaithersburg."

27:35.237 --> 27:38.446
I have eyes on him. Looks like
he's leaving. He may be a flight risk.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.652
Ressler, you chased the UNSUB
from the scene.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.943
I didn't get a good look, I can't confirm.

27:43.120 --> 27:47.034
- You need to roll units.
- His medical file, how did you get a copy?

27:47.207 --> 27:48.539
Reddington got it for me.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.122
- Meaning, he stole it for you?
- Sir, he's leaving.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.787
<i>Because he stole it,
evidence may be inadmissible.</i>

27:53.964 --> 27:56.832
We won't know till we arrest him.
Liz can't without a badge.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.173
Keen, listen to me, put a bumper lock
on Hollis, but do not engage.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.052
Ressler and Navabi are en route.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.632
Let's just hope if this is our guy...

28:05.809 --> 28:08.847
...you didn't jeopardize our ability
to put him where he belongs.

28:14.526 --> 28:18.566
Thank you for agreeing to do this.
You know you don't have to.

28:18.739 --> 28:21.072
It's the right thing to do.

28:21.617 --> 28:22.824
Yes, it is.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.576
My grandmother always says
I should do the right thing.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.988
I think your grandma
will be very proud of you.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.452
Does the place we're going have snacks?

28:30.626 --> 28:32.663
- I like Doritos.
- Are you serious?

28:32.836 --> 28:35.829
I love Doritos. Which is your favorite?
Mine, Spicy Nacho...

28:36.006 --> 28:39.374
...unless I'm depressed, then I mainline
Jacked 3D Bacon Cheddar Ranch.

28:42.471 --> 28:43.928
Guys, what's going on?

28:44.097 --> 28:46.214
No idea. Engine just gave out.

28:50.604 --> 28:53.312
- Guys?
- I got it. I got it.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.516
Guns down. Hands up.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.408
- No. Stop.
- No. No.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.409
No.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.070
Help me.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.457
Let me go. Let me go.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.642
FBI. Move, move.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.106
Everybody, down.

29:44.074 --> 29:46.987
<i>Liz, we just got off the phone
with the Gaithersburg Police.</i>

29:47.160 --> 29:50.198
<i>We have officers at Hollis's home.
The place is full of evidence.</i>

29:50.372 --> 29:52.455
<i>They're pulling prints now,
but he's our guy.</i>

29:52.624 --> 29:54.581
<i>We're tracing your cell. We're not far.</i>

29:54.751 --> 29:56.208
We're pulling off the 270 now.

29:56.378 --> 29:58.290
<i>He just stopped on Little Seneca Lake.</i>

29:58.463 --> 30:01.797
<i>Some minimum-maintenance road
off the westbound 117.</i>

30:01.967 --> 30:03.583
<i>We're minutes out. Hold tight.</i>

30:03.760 --> 30:05.296
We're pulling maps of the area.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.838
If there were a cabin or a house,
I would see it. I'm losing light.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.303
I've lost him in the shadows.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.436
<i>Liz?</i>

30:17.983 --> 30:19.440
Liz?

30:20.736 --> 30:22.147
The gun too.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.822
Let's go for a drive.

30:39.296 --> 30:43.540
- Where are we going?
- Quiet. Keep walking.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.260
- I only ask...
- I said, quiet.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.906
Let's go.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.249
What is this place?

31:28.887 --> 31:31.095
Come on in, Elizabeth.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.178
There's something
I wanna share with you.

31:40.482 --> 31:42.895
Agent Keen broke contact
13 minutes ago.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.856
State police have set up a perimeter
with roadblocks...

31:46.029 --> 31:48.066
...but there's a chance
she may be on foot.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.278
So our search area will run
from Sideline Road on the west...

31:51.451 --> 31:53.363
...to the shoreline on the east.

31:53.537 --> 31:56.245
And from Ten Mile Creek
down to Highway 117.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.499
Before she vanished,
Agent Keen was in pursuit of this man...

31:59.668 --> 32:01.079
...Anthony Hollis, former FBI.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.996
He is smart, he is armed.
He knows how we work. Be careful.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.380
- Are we clear on our grids?
- Yes, sir.

32:08.635 --> 32:12.128
- You're my therapist.
- And this is our final session.

32:12.305 --> 32:15.548
When we're done, I'm certain I'll be able
to recommend reinstatement.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.512
You know who this guy is,
what he does.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.222
Of course. I taught him.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.934
- No, that can't be.
- You're angry. That's good.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.314
Anger can be so...

32:23.483 --> 32:24.894
- ...exhilarating.
- Don't.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.856
Fixating on unsolved cases.
How unfair they are.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.941
- Do not twist my...
- I know it's corny...

32:30.115 --> 32:32.858
...but I am obsessed
with painting outside the lines.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.150
I am not like you.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.820
- Not yet.
- Never.

32:38.915 --> 32:43.205
I kill serial killers.
I brought you here to recruit you.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.995
The same way I recruited Hollis.

32:47.048 --> 32:51.543
I've had my eye on you for ages,
ever since you shot the attorney general...

32:51.720 --> 32:52.801
...for being a traitor.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.510
I knew then,
you were someone I needed to recruit.

32:56.683 --> 33:01.018
So when your psychiatric evaluation
was ordered, I made sure...

33:01.188 --> 33:02.850
...I was assigned to your case.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.810
Talk about exhilarating.

33:04.983 --> 33:09.774
The profiler and the daughter
of Raymond Reddington.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.235
In our sessions, you were everything
I could have hoped for.

33:13.408 --> 33:17.152
Comfortable with your darker impulses.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.946
So I tested you out in the field.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.615
The Capricorn Killer.

33:23.251 --> 33:27.165
You knew Psych Services would
reach out to me, assign me the case.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.126
That it would lead me to you.

33:29.299 --> 33:32.792
I knew that stealing a few private
medical files wouldn't stop you.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.336
All you've done is confess to murder.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.222
I've revealed myself to you.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.555
And you're about to reveal yourself to me.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.645
And maybe even to yourself.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.952
You know where we are, right?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.043
Susie Baker.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.962
He brought her here.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.344
He brought them all here.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.349
Why would you bring me here?

34:23.853 --> 34:25.936
To do what has to be done.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.443
To kill the Sandman.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.330
Quiet.

34:52.507 --> 34:53.543
Stop walking.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.004
I used to counsel families.

34:56.177 --> 34:59.090
Tried to ease their pain. Help them heal.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.177
But there are times
when there is no healing.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.846
Because there's no justice.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.057
Susie died in this room.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.814
We can't bring her back.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.564
But for her family, to help them heal...

35:14.237 --> 35:16.854
...this is the next best thing.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.572
He suffocated her with a pillow.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.157
Go on.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.663
I know you want to.

35:41.056 --> 35:43.514
FBI. Hands where we can see them.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.057
Leave him. I got this one.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.728
Circle back. Head west.
See if you can find that woman.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.722
- And make sure...
- Look out.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.119
Stop!

36:21.262 --> 36:23.549
I can't believe I read you wrong.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.767
Maybe you didn't.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.763
I tried.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.432
- I thought...
- Don't beat yourself up, Keen.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.016
I'll get us a sketch.

37:14.190 --> 37:18.935
State police are combing the woods.
Whoever she is, we're gonna find her.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.229
At least we got these two, right?

37:21.406 --> 37:23.363
Silver linings.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.494
Hey, if there's anything good
that happened today...

37:28.663 --> 37:30.529
...is that we secured a witness...

37:30.707 --> 37:34.166
...who's gonna testify
against the man who killed Tom.

37:34.836 --> 37:38.250
Like I said, silver linings.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.464
- What?
- Whoever it was...

37:44.637 --> 37:46.003
...they came out of nowhere.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.592
But there was a team, SWAT.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.099
I know, but it happened fast,
they overwhelmed us.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.225
- They boxed us in...
- The witness is gone?

37:52.395 --> 37:54.853
Not gone. He's missing.
We're gonna get him back.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.686
- We're gonna get him back.
- No, you're not.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.601
Liz, Liz, listen. So look.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.396
I pulled all of the feeds.
Now, the vans were unmarked.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.781
- There were no plates, but I'm...
- Aram.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.816
This is not your fault.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.031
I'm not blaming you.

38:10.205 --> 38:14.040
But five minutes after he was taken,
that sweet kid was dead.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.623
I'm not gonna stop
until I can prove Garvey did this.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.421
He won't get away with it.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.421
He already has.

38:28.598 --> 38:29.714
Agent Keen.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.685
It's been a hard few days.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.145
Aram lost a witness.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.777
While you got Hollis,
his partner in crime got away.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.609
These are setbacks, and they sting.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.991
In this line of work, I've learned
you have to take the good and bad.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.278
So let's take a moment,
focus on the good. Dr. Fulton.

38:53.623 --> 38:56.787
I've submitted my report to the office
of the Inspector General.

38:56.960 --> 39:01.705
He's agreed with my recommendation that
you be reinstated, effective immediately.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.294
Congratulations, Agent Keen.

39:04.634 --> 39:06.967
Thank you. This is a big relief.

39:07.136 --> 39:10.379
You deserve it.
You've worked hard in counseling.

39:10.557 --> 39:13.265
You've been honest
about your grief and loss.

39:13.434 --> 39:17.519
And you've been remarkably willing
to reveal to me who you truly are.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.773
A fine agent and an even better person.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.814
I didn't reinstate you
because you let me go.

39:28.992 --> 39:33.111
But you did let me go,
and I wanna thank you for that.

39:34.330 --> 39:38.700
My father has people
he can turn to for help.

39:38.877 --> 39:43.372
Doctors, lawyers, finders, freaks.

39:43.923 --> 39:48.793
People with special skills.
You have a special skill.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.426
And I'd like to know that,
someday, I could turn to you.

39:53.683 --> 39:56.596
Reddington said
you were nothing like him.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.311
And you knew he was wrong.

40:00.481 --> 40:03.098
Well, you're done
with mandatory counseling.

40:03.276 --> 40:07.065
But if you ever wanna come in
on a voluntary basis...

40:07.697 --> 40:09.939
...my door is always open.

40:20.543 --> 40:23.627
- I don't see the witness.
- You never will.

40:23.796 --> 40:25.708
I've taken him away.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.669
From you and the FBI.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.299
I told you to bring him to me.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.256
Yes, a thuggish order...

40:31.429 --> 40:34.638
...I immediately disregarded
because I don't take orders from you.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.470
The witness and his grandmother
are safe and secure.

40:38.019 --> 40:41.478
And as long as I'm alive,
he will not testify against you.

40:41.648 --> 40:42.934
What about Keen?

40:43.107 --> 40:44.643
She's a witness.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.729
You gonna put her out of my reach too?

40:46.903 --> 40:49.361
I don't have to.
Because where she is concerned...

40:49.530 --> 40:50.816
...you have no leverage.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.698
Secret or no secret,
if you reach out to her...

40:53.868 --> 40:55.279
...I'll cut off your hands.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.287
If you look in her direction,
I'll cut out your eyes.

40:58.456 --> 41:02.700
And if you ever utter her name again
in my presence, I'll cut out your tongue.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.752
You have no idea who I am...

41:05.922 --> 41:07.879
...or why I want the truth.

41:08.424 --> 41:11.258
Aren't you curious?
Don't you have any questions?

41:11.427 --> 41:14.636
I have plenty of questions,
but none I'd pose to you.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.516
The answers will have to wait
for me to find out on my own.

41:18.685 --> 41:19.892
Good luck with that.

41:20.061 --> 41:24.146
Mr. Garvey, might I suggest
you enjoy what little time you have left.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.479
Crab cakes. Scalp massages.

41:27.652 --> 41:32.317
Perhaps a double feature
of <i>The 400 Blows</i> and <i>Jules and Jim.</i>

41:32.490 --> 41:34.777
Whatever floats your boat. Do it now.

41:34.951 --> 41:38.444
Because I will find those bones,
and when I do...

41:38.621 --> 41:40.078
...I'm gonna kill you.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.455
You are an odd one, aren't you?

41:48.172 --> 41:50.710
- Yes?
<i>- I need you to promise me something.</i>

41:50.883 --> 41:51.919
Of course.

41:52.093 --> 41:55.211
<i>You're doing everything in your power
to get Garvey.</i>

41:55.388 --> 41:57.345
What's this about?

41:57.890 --> 41:59.631
He got him.

42:00.059 --> 42:02.346
We were so close, and then...

42:03.229 --> 42:04.515
You have my word.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.306
<i>The bag, the secret,
you won't let them get in the way?</i>

42:07.483 --> 42:10.191
- I've already told you.
- Tell me again, I need to hear it.

42:10.361 --> 42:14.446
<i>I promise,
Ian Garvey will not get away from me.</i>
