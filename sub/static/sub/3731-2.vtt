[eclectic orchestral theme plays]

02:08.788 --> 02:13.085
It was the same woman from my dream,
I'm sure of it. The same face.

02:13.168 --> 02:16.713
You gotta stop watching all those
cop shows. They will mess you up.

02:16.796 --> 02:19.716
I feel like I know her,
I just don't remember from where.

02:19.799 --> 02:22.343
- Maybe someone from your criminal past.
- [scoffs]

02:22.427 --> 02:25.305
- I wasn't a criminal.
- No. Activist.

02:25.430 --> 02:26.765
Hacktivist.

02:27.557 --> 02:29.851
- Reformed, paroled, legal.
- Uh-huh.

02:29.935 --> 02:33.230
And what about all these
security companies that you hack for?

02:33.313 --> 02:35.857
Well, it's not hacking
if you get paid for it.

02:35.941 --> 02:38.818
Anyway, I thought I knew her
from one of my client companies,

02:38.944 --> 02:40.612
but no, that's not it.

02:40.695 --> 02:42.697
You've led a lot of different lives.

02:42.781 --> 02:44.032
- So have you.
- Me?

02:44.116 --> 02:46.701
I've been working at the same bookstore
since you met me,

02:46.785 --> 02:49.454
but not for much longer
if I don't shake my ass.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.373
- Oh... Wait, wait.
- [chuckles]

03:01.925 --> 03:05.345
OK, but tell me honestly,
am I sounding crazy?

03:06.346 --> 03:08.098
Maybe you should write about it.

03:09.099 --> 03:10.267
I am.

03:10.350 --> 03:14.020
Well, it is that time of year.
You always go a little crazy at Pride.

03:14.104 --> 03:15.772
You know why.

03:15.855 --> 03:19.109
Honey, if I had your parents,
I'd be more than a little crazy.

03:19.192 --> 03:21.778
- I'd be homicidal.
- Mm.

03:26.158 --> 03:28.827
[Deshawn] You got a funny look
in your eye, Will.

03:28.910 --> 03:30.703
You hot for me or somethin'?

03:30.787 --> 03:32.455
I know I'm USDA prime cut,

03:32.538 --> 03:34.457
but you should know
I don't swing that way.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.543
Thanks for clearing that up.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.965
Ain't gonna be good for my rep
having no 5-0 sittin' bedside.

03:42.048 --> 03:44.343
Yeah, it's not helping me much either.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.803
So you think you own me now
or somethin'?

03:46.886 --> 03:47.887
No...

03:49.264 --> 03:51.557
What I did for you
I would've done for anybody.

03:51.641 --> 03:53.768
So what, then?

03:56.855 --> 03:59.440
I was just thinking about
what you said in the car...

04:00.525 --> 04:02.235
about your dad being shot.

04:03.569 --> 04:05.322
Long time ago.

04:05.405 --> 04:07.032
Things ain't no different.

04:08.033 --> 04:09.284
My dad was shot.

04:10.702 --> 04:11.661
Dead?

04:13.538 --> 04:17.376
Some parts of him.
Finished his career.

04:19.252 --> 04:22.588
Cops get shot,
hear about it on the news all day.

04:22.672 --> 04:26.301
We get shot all the time,
but we don't mean nothin' to nobody.

04:29.762 --> 04:33.183
Will, tell me about your gangsta days.

04:37.062 --> 04:39.856
My kid? My fuckin' kid?

04:39.939 --> 04:41.358
What are you thinking?

04:41.441 --> 04:43.943
- Shoplifting, for Chrissakes?
- [boy panting]

04:44.027 --> 04:46.571
You know who I am? Do you?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.157
The matter with you?

04:51.534 --> 04:53.119
[sighs] I'm sorry.

05:03.380 --> 05:05.424
I don't know what he's thinkin'.

05:12.347 --> 05:15.392
Hey! Hey!

05:16.893 --> 05:19.562
This fuckin' kid.

05:19.645 --> 05:21.647
You picked the lock? [chuckles]

05:21.731 --> 05:24.401
My dad was always workin'.
I was always waitin'.

05:24.484 --> 05:26.861
Not much else to play with
at a police station.

05:26.945 --> 05:29.239
Yeah, Will, you know
you gotta teach me that trick.

05:29.322 --> 05:32.200
[chuckles] All right.

05:33.326 --> 05:34.702
I should go.

05:36.788 --> 05:38.164
[Deshawn] Hey.

05:38.248 --> 05:40.583
I don't owe you for what you did...

05:41.418 --> 05:44.670
but you should know
I won't ever forget it.

05:49.842 --> 05:53.472
[Nomi] I've been thinking about my life,

05:53.554 --> 05:56.682
and all of the mistakes that I've made.

06:02.230 --> 06:05.775
The ones that stay with me,
the ones that I regret,

06:05.858 --> 06:08.528
are the ones that I made
because of fear.

06:18.788 --> 06:22.041
For a long time,
I was afraid to be who I am

06:22.125 --> 06:24.503
because I was taught by my parents

06:24.585 --> 06:28.923
that there's something wrong
with someone like me.

06:29.799 --> 06:34.513
Something offensive,
something you would avoid,

06:34.595 --> 06:36.473
maybe even pity.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.393
Something that you could never love.

06:40.477 --> 06:43.062
[singing softly]

06:45.731 --> 06:48.651
My mom, she's a fan
of St. Thomas Aquinas.

06:48.734 --> 06:51.488
She calls pride a sin.

06:51.571 --> 06:54.449
And of all the venal and mortal sins,

06:54.533 --> 06:58.244
St. Thomas saw pride
as the queen of the seven deadlies.

06:58.328 --> 06:59.620
Wolfgang!

06:59.704 --> 07:02.415
He saw it as the ultimate gateway sin

07:02.499 --> 07:04.709
that would turn you quickly
into a sinaholic.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.879
The greatest box man in the world!

07:09.172 --> 07:13.510
But hating isn't a sin on that list.

07:13.593 --> 07:15.220
Neither is shame.

07:23.228 --> 07:24.729
[snoring softly]

07:34.447 --> 07:36.533
Come on, Dad. Time to go.

07:36.616 --> 07:40.286
I was afraid of this parade
because I wanted so badly

07:40.370 --> 07:41.829
to be a part of it.

07:41.913 --> 07:44.999
- [bird twittering]
- [insects chirring]

08:07.480 --> 08:11.901
So today,
I'm marching for that part of me

08:11.984 --> 08:14.737
that was once too afraid to march.

08:22.495 --> 08:25.206
And for all the people
who can't march...

08:26.749 --> 08:29.877
the people living lives like I did.

08:32.589 --> 08:37.093
Today, I march to remember
that I'm not just a me.

08:37.176 --> 08:39.720
I'm also a we.

08:39.804 --> 08:41.556
And we march with pride.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.184
[dance music playing]

08:47.186 --> 08:49.522
So go fuck yourself, Aquinas.

08:49.606 --> 08:51.149
Hell, yeah!

08:51.232 --> 08:54.944
[dance music continues]

09:05.330 --> 09:08.124
[shouts]

09:19.010 --> 09:20.761
- [camera clicks]
- You OK back there?

09:25.684 --> 09:26.976
[gunshot echoes]

09:28.102 --> 09:29.937
[people gasping]

09:31.105 --> 09:35.026
[singing softly]

09:41.782 --> 09:44.661
[singing in unison]

09:46.663 --> 09:50.500
- [continues singing softly]
- [heart monitor beeps steadily]

10:12.772 --> 10:15.441
- Mom, she's up.
- Oh, thank God.

10:15.525 --> 10:18.611
I was sure he was gonna
be in a coma the rest of my life.

10:20.905 --> 10:22.699
How you feeling, Michael?

10:22.782 --> 10:24.825
My name is Nomi.

10:24.909 --> 10:28.204
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your mother's been calling you Michael.

10:28.287 --> 10:30.498
What kind of name is Nomi?

10:30.582 --> 10:32.709
Have you ever heard
of anyone named Nomi?

10:32.792 --> 10:35.378
You were Michael
before you came out of me,

10:35.461 --> 10:38.130
and you will be Michael
until they put me in my grave.

10:38.214 --> 10:40.800
Mom, come on. She almost died.

10:40.883 --> 10:42.968
Serves you right.

10:44.804 --> 10:47.599
You shouldn't be riding on motorcycles.

10:47.682 --> 10:51.852
Do you know how many people a year
die on those things?

10:52.812 --> 10:54.021
Where's Amanita?

10:55.314 --> 10:56.357
She left.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.944
She wouldn't have left me.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.322
This hospital only allows family
into critical care.

11:03.406 --> 11:05.825
She is my family.

11:05.908 --> 11:08.745
Please, Michael, this isn't your blog.

11:08.828 --> 11:11.456
This is your life.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.752
I think that you should go.

11:17.002 --> 11:19.839
I'm not going anywhere.

11:19.922 --> 11:22.592
I'm your mother and I love you.

11:24.176 --> 11:26.512
It may be on my terms, but I do,

11:26.596 --> 11:30.224
so I'm not leaving here
until you talk to Dr. Metzger.

11:30.308 --> 11:34.646
You still want me to go
after he tells you what he told us...

11:37.523 --> 11:39.942
then I promise I will leave you alone.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.112
[Will] I'm not crazy.

11:43.195 --> 11:45.657
- Didn't say you were.
- Yeah, but--

11:45.740 --> 11:49.452
You didn't believe me either, not about
the woman, the building, the stash,

11:49.535 --> 11:52.037
none of it.
Maybe you'll believe a camera.

11:52.121 --> 11:54.833
Building across the street
has got a CTV.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.208
I requisitioned the file.

11:56.292 --> 11:59.003
This camera's got a perfect view
of the front and back.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.046
Anybody pulled a body out,
we'll see it.

12:02.131 --> 12:04.717
OK, this is about the time we pulled over

12:04.801 --> 12:06.511
because I thought
I saw that woman, right?

12:06.594 --> 12:09.013
Ooh, the blond ghost in her underwear.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.182
I think she visited me last night.

12:11.265 --> 12:12.725
All right, here it is.

12:16.312 --> 12:18.063
What the hell?

12:20.692 --> 12:21.942
[tapping keys]

12:23.027 --> 12:25.237
This has been erased.

12:25.321 --> 12:29.033
- Somebody erased two hours of this.
- That is weird.

12:29.784 --> 12:31.994
Man, D, something is going on here.

12:32.871 --> 12:35.581
I'll give you there's definitely
a flag on the play.

12:39.001 --> 12:42.129
Hey, yo. Check out our man here.

12:43.339 --> 12:44.883
[Diego] Uh-huh.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.469
He saw the whole thing.

12:48.553 --> 12:51.389
[Metzger] This is what a normal,
healthy brain looks like:

12:51.472 --> 12:54.517
two distinct,
well-differentiated frontal lobes.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.479
The problem begins here in
the substantia alba of the frontal lobe.

12:58.563 --> 13:01.023
These two masses
are growing into one another.

13:01.106 --> 13:03.401
You see? There's no separation.

13:03.484 --> 13:06.070
[Metzger] It's often misdiagnosed
as acute encephalitis,

13:06.153 --> 13:10.408
but it's a condition called UFLS:
undifferentiated frontal lobe syndrome.

13:11.367 --> 13:14.495
- All acronyms are scary.
- Yeah.

13:14.579 --> 13:16.915
I'll be honest with you, Nomi, is it?

13:18.040 --> 13:19.250
It's not good.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.794
There is a procedure to treat UFLS,

13:21.878 --> 13:23.755
but it requires
a very aggressive surgery

13:23.838 --> 13:25.924
where we go in
and try to cut away the growth.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.675
Oh, my God.

13:27.759 --> 13:30.803
[mother]
The surgery is also incredibly expensive.

13:30.887 --> 13:33.598
You're going to need to use our insurance.

13:33.681 --> 13:37.268
- Mom.
- These are just the facts, Teagan.

13:37.351 --> 13:39.938
And if I don't have the surgery?

13:40.020 --> 13:43.566
Without the surgery,
the tissue will continue to metastasize.

13:43.649 --> 13:48.028
Patients will begin to experience
a deterioration of mental faculties.

13:48.112 --> 13:50.406
It's common for them
to experience very intense,

13:50.489 --> 13:54.368
very real hallucinations and synesthesia
that precedes a loss of memory

13:54.452 --> 13:56.328
and a complete occlusion of identity.

13:56.412 --> 13:58.873
He told us if he didn't
operate immediately,

13:58.957 --> 14:02.835
- you could be dead within six months.
- [Teagan] Jesus Christ, Mom!

14:02.919 --> 14:07.006
You understand now, Michael?
You're going to need us.

14:07.089 --> 14:10.969
- You're going to need your family.
- Don't touch me! You are not my family!

14:11.051 --> 14:13.972
- We should go.
- This is for your own good, Michael.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.348
Don't call me that!

14:16.432 --> 14:18.643
- You're my child. I love you.
- Go!

14:18.726 --> 14:20.895
Just... [sobs] Just go.

14:29.821 --> 14:32.197
- [fans cheering]
- [overlapping chatter]

14:43.083 --> 14:45.544
[fans cheering]

14:55.220 --> 14:56.639
[cheering continues]

15:02.770 --> 15:06.983
At the premiere with one of the
rising stars in Mexico, Lito Rodriguez,

15:07.066 --> 15:13.739
who was recently voted one of the
sexiest men in the world by En Fuego.

15:13.823 --> 15:15.867
- Congratulations, Lito.
- Thank you.

15:15.950 --> 15:19.037
And the second time we've seen you
with Ms. Velasquez, isn't it?

15:19.119 --> 15:22.790
What are we to make of this?

15:22.874 --> 15:24.876
Are you guys an item now?

15:25.668 --> 15:28.462
- We're just friends.
- Good friends.

15:29.505 --> 15:31.841
OK. Good friends.
We like hanging out.

15:31.924 --> 15:33.425
He's an amazing dancer.

15:33.509 --> 15:37.013
Oh, it must be your Spanish blood, right?

15:37.096 --> 15:40.058
- His father taught flamenco.
- Oh, he was from Barcelona, wasn't he?

15:40.140 --> 15:43.185
Bilbao actually.
But he taught in Barcelona.

15:44.562 --> 15:46.105
He was a true artist.

15:46.188 --> 15:47.773
But let's be honest, Christina,

15:47.857 --> 15:51.318
when we're out on the dance floor,
nobody's looking at me.

15:51.402 --> 15:53.362
- [laughs]
- Who could take their eyes off her?

15:53.445 --> 15:55.114
[Christina] He's a keeper.

15:55.781 --> 15:59.994
And the movie is
Love Has No Boundaries But Death.

16:00.828 --> 16:05.207
[Rajan] Well, the truth is,
she never even looked at me, not once.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.669
I felt like a stalker,
waiting in the cafeteria

16:08.753 --> 16:10.295
for a chance to ask her out.

16:10.379 --> 16:12.048
[laughter]

16:12.131 --> 16:13.799
I was sure that she didn't like me.

16:14.675 --> 16:17.803
But my father taught me
that fortune favors the bold,

16:17.887 --> 16:20.431
so I decided to send her flowers
on her birthday.

16:21.140 --> 16:22.558
Lots of flowers.

16:22.641 --> 16:25.519
[woman gasps]
Oh, my God, Kala.

16:28.647 --> 16:30.274
And that got me a chance for a date.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.069
[all chuckling]

16:33.819 --> 16:36.781
Kala loves the movies,
so we went to see A Match Made by God.

16:36.864 --> 16:38.699
Of course, Auntie and Sister came along.

16:38.783 --> 16:40.200
[laughter]

16:41.410 --> 16:45.247
And when Shah Rukh Khan sang
"I See God in You,"

16:45.330 --> 16:47.207
and I saw tears in her eyes,

16:47.291 --> 16:51.087
I hoped more than anything
I've ever wanted...

16:52.088 --> 16:55.549
that one day she might
feel that way for me.

16:55.633 --> 16:58.094
- [women] Aw!
- [applause]

17:02.640 --> 17:06.644
- I told you I had a surprise for you.
- [slow guitar music plays]

17:06.727 --> 17:08.687
[applause]

17:15.194 --> 17:17.863
- [up-tempo rhythm]
- [crowd cheering]

17:19.865 --> 17:25.746
- [sings along softly in Hindi]
- [crowd clapping]

17:32.252 --> 17:34.672
[crowd whistling, cheering]

17:42.221 --> 17:45.224
[whistling, cheering]

18:02.616 --> 18:04.451
[cheering]

18:09.498 --> 18:12.001
[excited chatter]

18:13.669 --> 18:16.296
[whistling]

18:28.684 --> 18:31.353
[whistling and cheering]

18:45.784 --> 18:47.828
[song tempo quickens]

19:15.689 --> 19:18.859
- [song ends]
- [crowd cheering, whistling]

19:21.528 --> 19:24.031
[indistinct conversation]

19:26.075 --> 19:28.035
I like this man.

19:28.119 --> 19:30.704
- I really do.
- [crowd applauding]

19:32.539 --> 19:34.458
You have no idea
what's going on, right?

19:34.541 --> 19:37.878
So you just kinda have to,
like, let go and go with it.

19:37.962 --> 19:40.714
And Lito, you-- You're so good.

19:40.798 --> 19:42.341
I'll tell you the truth.

19:42.424 --> 19:45.844
Sometimes when we were shooting,
I was a little bit confused.

19:45.928 --> 19:47.763
Am I this twin here? Am I that twin?

19:47.846 --> 19:51.267
No, no, no, but you make it work.
You carry us through.

19:51.350 --> 19:56.772
I mean, there's only like one,
maybe two problems.

19:56.855 --> 19:58.232
What?

19:59.900 --> 20:01.277
[laughing]

20:02.069 --> 20:04.363
- She's horrible. Horrible.
- Come on.

20:04.488 --> 20:07.283
Don't know what's more fake,
her acting or her tits.

20:07.366 --> 20:09.076
- No, seriously--
- You're terrible.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.287
No, you don't even worry
when the ship goes down,

20:11.370 --> 20:14.790
you know she's going to float away
safely on those things. [laughs]

20:16.334 --> 20:21.297
And afterward, she came up to you
and you told her how great she was.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.507
How do you even do that?

20:25.176 --> 20:26.885
[sighs]

20:26.969 --> 20:32.766
You know, you just look them
right in the eye and you lie.

20:32.850 --> 20:34.977
It's what we do. It's called acting.

20:35.769 --> 20:37.479
Speaking of...

20:39.857 --> 20:45.196
would you like to come upstairs and...
run some lines with me?

20:45.988 --> 20:49.783
I can't. I have an early call tomorrow.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.494
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:53.871 --> 20:57.749
I am not used to men telling me no.

20:58.959 --> 21:00.711
It's kind of turning me on.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.463
- I'm sorry.
- Are you sure?

21:03.547 --> 21:05.383
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You sure? You sure?

21:05.465 --> 21:07.009
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- You sure?

21:07.092 --> 21:09.636
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah. Good night.

21:11.347 --> 21:12.890
Mm...

21:14.474 --> 21:17.769
[heavy panting]

21:17.853 --> 21:20.480
[moaning, panting]

21:28.447 --> 21:29.823
[gasps]

21:35.287 --> 21:37.873
[woman breathes rapidly]

21:37.956 --> 21:41.085
[crying out]

21:48.259 --> 21:49.634
[moans]

21:52.471 --> 21:54.973
[both panting]

21:55.974 --> 22:00.687
[exhales] Are you hot? Whoo.
I'm burning up.

22:01.939 --> 22:04.691
It wasn't hot
until Rajan started dancing.

22:06.818 --> 22:10.489
- He was good, wasn't he?
- He is awesome.

22:10.572 --> 22:11.823
[laughter]

22:11.907 --> 22:15.702
Trust me, if you don't marry him, I will.

22:15.786 --> 22:17.579
[laughs]

22:17.662 --> 22:20.416
He's so cute.

22:26.755 --> 22:27.798
Whoo.

22:34.805 --> 22:38.434
I think locking my keys in my car
was the best thing that's happened to me

22:38.517 --> 22:40.269
in a very long time.

22:40.352 --> 22:41.728
[chuckles]

22:43.814 --> 22:46.108
I'm hungry.

22:49.027 --> 22:50.779
I can make something.

22:50.862 --> 22:53.824
No, I have a real craving.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.952
For what?

22:58.287 --> 22:59.871
Indian food.

23:00.664 --> 23:02.833
Sanyam, sir, the food was unbelievable.

23:02.916 --> 23:04.793
- Really, everybody was blown away.
- [woman] Yes.

23:04.876 --> 23:07.671
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes, it was very good.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.549
Even though I don't much like
Indian food, but it was good.

23:10.632 --> 23:13.218
I'm more than willing
to help with the wedding if--

23:13.302 --> 23:15.053
Oh, no, no. That won't be necessary.

23:15.137 --> 23:18.932
We're bringing in finest chefs
from Europe and Asia. We are good.

23:19.016 --> 23:22.561
They say the only thing people
remember about a wedding is the food.

23:22.644 --> 23:24.313
- Yes.
- Well, if it's going to be as good

23:24.396 --> 23:27.941
as yours was tonight, then the wedding
is definitely going to be unforgettable.

23:28.025 --> 23:30.152
What is unforgettable was your song.

23:30.235 --> 23:32.696
Yes, it was the highlight
of the evening.

23:32.779 --> 23:33.947
Thank you, Auntie.

23:37.284 --> 23:38.618
Did you like it?

23:38.702 --> 23:41.746
I did, very much. [giggles]

23:42.873 --> 23:46.043
Sir, is it all right if I say good night?

23:46.126 --> 23:48.420
Yes, yes. Go on. Yes.

23:50.005 --> 23:51.298
Thank you.

24:01.933 --> 24:03.435
[whispers] Are you awake?

24:06.771 --> 24:09.400
- Are you awake?
- [soft moan]

24:12.528 --> 24:14.863
[whispers] Don't lie.

24:14.946 --> 24:16.323
Are you awake?

24:21.828 --> 24:23.581
[louder] Are you awake?

24:25.374 --> 24:26.875
I am now.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.670
Mm...

24:32.005 --> 24:33.757
How'd it go?

24:35.133 --> 24:36.510
[whispers] I don't know.

24:40.931 --> 24:42.682
It was OK.

24:43.350 --> 24:44.726
They liked it?

24:44.809 --> 24:46.604
Yeah. You know, it's a premiere.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.564
They have to like it.

24:48.647 --> 24:50.815
[grunts] They liked it.

24:52.192 --> 24:54.152
I told you they would.

24:56.071 --> 24:59.199
A lot of people were confused
about which twin survived.

24:59.283 --> 25:02.702
Well, that's the whole point.
The uncertainty of our own humanity.

25:02.786 --> 25:05.914
If they don't get that,
they're just fucking idiots.

25:05.997 --> 25:07.416
[chuckles]

25:08.166 --> 25:10.210
You make it sound much better
than it is.

25:11.044 --> 25:13.964
And what did Ms. Velasquez
have to say about it?

25:14.798 --> 25:16.467
- It was fun.
- Hm.

25:16.550 --> 25:20.929
Let me guess. She was complaining
the whole night about Ana's breasts.

25:22.222 --> 25:26.101
But you didn't pick her because of
her insight into genre fiction, did you?

25:26.184 --> 25:28.687
No, no.
I have someone else for that.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.481
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:30.564 --> 25:32.441
Who is that?

25:32.524 --> 25:36.236
- He's amazing. He's very sexy.
- Mm?

25:36.320 --> 25:40.324
Super smart. And he does something
that drives me crazy.

25:40.407 --> 25:41.866
- When he's reading...
- Hm-mm.

25:41.950 --> 25:43.702
...and he's really into it,

25:43.785 --> 25:49.333
he touches his glasses and wrinkles up
his nose at the same time, like this.

25:49.416 --> 25:52.377
- Look.
- [laughs]

25:53.753 --> 25:57.090
Every time he does that,
I fall in love with him.

25:57.174 --> 26:00.344
Well, he sounds great.

26:02.179 --> 26:06.266
Why not take him... to your premieres?

26:07.726 --> 26:09.019
[Lito sighs]

26:09.894 --> 26:11.313
[whispers] Come on.

26:13.898 --> 26:16.776
- [sighs]
- I'm sorry.

26:16.860 --> 26:18.945
You know I'm just jealous.

26:20.030 --> 26:22.907
[sighs] I just want to be your armpiece.

26:24.743 --> 26:29.748
Why be jealous of the arm,
when you already have my heart?

26:35.128 --> 26:38.507
- What movie is that from?
- [giggling]

26:40.175 --> 26:42.511
[sighs] I forgot.

26:42.594 --> 26:44.304
[laughing]

26:44.388 --> 26:48.767
- Well, it's... it's quite good.
- [laughs] Come on.

26:51.102 --> 26:53.021
[sighing]

26:54.898 --> 26:58.694
I've been thinking,
it might be time for someone else.

27:00.153 --> 27:04.324
Why? Do you think Daniela
knows something?

27:04.408 --> 27:09.621
No. I think she just wants
what she cannot have.

27:10.497 --> 27:12.750
Mm, damn right.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.547
[grunts] It's mine.

27:18.630 --> 27:21.383
[laughing]

27:23.761 --> 27:25.470
I had a really nice time.

27:26.513 --> 27:27.847
Me, too.

27:30.642 --> 27:35.564
I'm just trying to figure out
if this is it, or you know...

27:35.647 --> 27:37.065
if there's more to it.

27:40.985 --> 27:42.862
I'm not looking for a relationship.

27:47.951 --> 27:49.787
What are you looking for?

28:19.817 --> 28:21.401
Wolfgang?

28:21.485 --> 28:22.694
Wolfgang?

28:24.696 --> 28:25.697
Hey.

28:28.366 --> 28:31.286
Is there someone else?

28:32.996 --> 28:34.164
No.

28:39.210 --> 28:40.211
[chuckles]

28:40.295 --> 28:43.256
[intercom buzzes]

28:52.557 --> 28:54.351
- [sighs]
- [buzzing continues]

29:00.106 --> 29:02.860
Hey, just friend.

29:02.942 --> 29:03.985
Daniela?

29:04.068 --> 29:06.112
Mm...

29:07.197 --> 29:09.115
Uh-oh.

29:11.075 --> 29:13.704
I was sleeping, Daniela.
What are you doing here?

29:13.787 --> 29:16.956
[moans] I couldn't sleep.

29:18.583 --> 29:20.335
I brought company.

29:20.418 --> 29:21.670
Oh.

29:24.255 --> 29:25.965
- You have to go home.
- Lito.

29:26.049 --> 29:29.845
Lito, if you don't let me upstairs,

29:29.928 --> 29:32.180
I'm gonna fall asleep
on this doorstep.

29:32.263 --> 29:34.057
[camera shutters clicking]

29:34.140 --> 29:37.644
Oh! Oh, no!
Are those photographers?

29:37.728 --> 29:38.978
Hi!

29:40.313 --> 29:43.191
You know I never say no to bubbles.

29:46.778 --> 29:49.072
- OK.
- [buzzing]

29:52.743 --> 29:55.537
Well, our families got on very well,

29:55.620 --> 29:58.832
as far as anyone
can get along with my father.

29:59.541 --> 30:01.668
My family can be complicated.

30:02.544 --> 30:06.590
Come on, we both know who's got
the easier job as far as in-laws go.

30:18.435 --> 30:21.396
Kala, I sometimes feel your hesitation.

30:21.479 --> 30:26.484
I know there are a lot of things that
might seem like they're separating us.

30:26.568 --> 30:32.031
Things like family, religion...
you can sing, I can't.

30:33.074 --> 30:34.659
Not true.

30:40.498 --> 30:42.459
It's true we grew up in separate worlds,

30:42.542 --> 30:48.548
but the only world I want to live in
is one where we can be together.

31:06.608 --> 31:09.110
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:33.468 --> 31:35.053
[unlocking door]

31:40.266 --> 31:42.226
[sighs] Open the door, Lito.

31:42.310 --> 31:45.563
[sighing]
This is not a good idea, Daniela.

31:45.647 --> 31:48.107
I was sleeping.
Please, we'll talk tomorrow.

31:49.567 --> 31:51.820
[whispers] Come on, Lito.

31:51.903 --> 31:53.738
You're acting like a girl.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.960
Mm...

32:08.419 --> 32:09.420
Daniela...

32:12.966 --> 32:15.426
[sighs] Daniela...

32:17.470 --> 32:20.682
We need to talk. OK?

32:21.975 --> 32:23.393
Talk.

32:24.936 --> 32:28.272
- Later.
- Daniela! [grunts]

32:29.399 --> 32:33.737
I've been thinking, um...
I need some space.

32:36.114 --> 32:40.451
Lito... I know where
you're going with this.

32:41.912 --> 32:43.204
I'm sorry.

32:44.288 --> 32:46.416
You can break up with me tomorrow.

32:47.458 --> 32:48.626
Daniela.

32:50.128 --> 32:52.463
- Please--
- Even though I don't know why you would.

32:52.547 --> 32:54.632
Everyone says we make
a fantastic couple.

32:54.716 --> 32:56.760
Please... [sighs]

32:56.843 --> 33:00.722
It's true.
But, you know, sadly...

33:02.974 --> 33:05.268
my heart belongs to another.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.397
That's cool.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.649
- [moans]
- Daniela! Dani!

33:11.733 --> 33:12.984
[sighs]

33:14.069 --> 33:15.486
This is not gonna work.

33:16.279 --> 33:18.489
This isn't work.

33:18.573 --> 33:21.242
It's just a little harmless sex.

33:21.325 --> 33:23.078
No.

33:23.161 --> 33:25.413
- Dani...
- So come on. [giggles]

33:25.496 --> 33:27.540
Dani! Dani!

33:27.624 --> 33:29.751
What is the problem, Lito?

33:32.253 --> 33:34.380
The problem is, honey...

33:36.091 --> 33:38.301
that you don't have a cock.

33:42.305 --> 33:45.391
[laughs, snorting]

33:46.225 --> 33:50.063
Hernando, my friend...
good one! [snorting]

33:53.316 --> 33:56.987
Oh, come on, Lito.
Look at her face. She totally knows.

33:57.070 --> 33:58.529
Knows what?

34:00.740 --> 34:06.621
[exhales] Fan-fucking-tastic.

34:06.704 --> 34:08.748
What?

34:08.832 --> 34:12.002
Oh, this is perfect.

34:12.085 --> 34:16.297
And it's so fucking hot I can't even
stand it, and-- We need glasses.

34:21.136 --> 34:23.262
I'm confused.

34:23.346 --> 34:26.016
I think perhaps I misjudged
Ms. Velasquez.

34:26.099 --> 34:28.768
This is gonna be perfect.

34:28.852 --> 34:30.145
This...

34:30.228 --> 34:31.729
It's gonna be so good for you.

34:31.813 --> 34:36.193
I mean, you obviously
need someone you can trust, right?

34:36.275 --> 34:39.320
Someone who can deflect the rumors?

34:39.403 --> 34:41.865
And if you know anything
about me or my family,

34:41.948 --> 34:46.536
it's that I had to become an expert
at doing such things.

34:48.955 --> 34:51.624
Oh... [sighs]

34:51.708 --> 34:55.128
And what do you think
you're gonna get out of this?

34:55.212 --> 34:57.630
- Are you kidding?
- No.

34:57.714 --> 34:58.840
This?

35:01.051 --> 35:03.178
This is like a dream come true.

35:04.762 --> 35:07.015
[Lito mutters] Ay...

35:15.356 --> 35:17.775
- [locks door]
- [exhales]

35:30.288 --> 35:31.831
[starts shower]

36:10.120 --> 36:11.537
[door opens]

36:11.621 --> 36:13.706
Time for your medicine.

36:14.832 --> 36:16.751
Why is the door locked?

36:16.834 --> 36:19.545
- It's hospital policy.
- What?

36:19.629 --> 36:22.548
Forget it. Look, I've decided
to check out, so you can, you know,

36:22.632 --> 36:25.426
- send my bill to my mom's insurance.
- I can't do that.

36:25.509 --> 36:27.011
OK, fine. I'll pay cash.

36:27.762 --> 36:30.223
Dr. Metzger's the only one
who can release you.

36:30.307 --> 36:33.559
You can't keep me here
against my will.

36:33.643 --> 36:36.980
Oh, I'm sorry, but we can.

36:37.063 --> 36:40.275
Dr. Metzger and your family
signed the papers.

36:40.358 --> 36:41.609
What?

36:41.692 --> 36:46.323
It's for your safety, Nomi,
as well as the people around you.

36:48.616 --> 36:50.160
Take your medicine.

36:54.205 --> 36:55.748
[door opens]

36:55.832 --> 36:58.709
[indistinct chatter]

36:58.793 --> 37:01.879
I'll have you know I've had a few
psychic experiences myself.

37:01.963 --> 37:04.632
Nocturnal emissions
don't count as psychic phenomenon.

37:04.715 --> 37:09.512
Seriously. This one time I was
walking my dog, and this guy goes by,

37:09.595 --> 37:13.266
totally innocuous, thin,
scraggly beard, didn't look twice.

37:13.350 --> 37:18.646
But Ditka suddenly goes nuts,
snappin' at him, barking like crazy.

37:18.729 --> 37:22.359
Couple days later, I see a sex offender
warrant out for the guy.

37:22.441 --> 37:23.693
Oh, yeah, yeah, I believe it.

37:23.776 --> 37:27.155
You know, there's some things animals
can sense going on that we can't.

37:27.238 --> 37:30.867
It should be noted that
Ditka licks his balls all day.

37:30.950 --> 37:33.328
And, if left alone,
will also eat his own shit.

37:34.245 --> 37:37.081
[man] OK, boys and girls, settle down.

37:37.832 --> 37:42.628
All right everybody, come on! Come on!
Come on guys, let's move it!

37:42.712 --> 37:48.134
We have a visitor from our friends
in Washington, so eyes and ears.

37:49.177 --> 37:50.928
Agent Stiles.

37:51.721 --> 37:52.930
Sorry. [clears throat]

37:53.014 --> 37:55.141
I know a lot of you guys
have seen me lurking about,

37:55.225 --> 37:58.353
and it's not because
I'm a butterscotch-bacon donut addict.

37:58.436 --> 38:00.855
- [overlapping mutters]
- Thanks very much, guys.

38:00.938 --> 38:04.234
The truth is, I head up a federal
task force for Homeland Security,

38:04.317 --> 38:09.197
which basically means I'm here
to help you guys catch the bad guys.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.574
This guy is one of the worst.

38:11.657 --> 38:15.078
Jonas Maliki.
Goes by a lot of different names,

38:15.161 --> 38:17.372
- Jonas Barnett most recently.
- What?

38:17.455 --> 38:20.083
- He's wanted for murder... [indistinct]
- I think know that guy.

38:20.166 --> 38:22.877
- How?
- I'm not sure.

38:24.712 --> 38:29.675
If he's still here in your city,
we need to know, and we need to know now.

38:36.974 --> 38:38.726
[Jonas] Nomi?

38:40.311 --> 38:43.940
- You have to get out of here.
- How-How did you get in here?

38:44.774 --> 38:47.151
If I try to explain it,
you wouldn't believe me.

38:47.235 --> 38:48.611
But you will.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.822
You-- You were at the parade.

38:51.906 --> 38:55.534
I was. I came looking for you.

38:56.827 --> 38:58.955
Oh, my God.

38:59.038 --> 39:01.999
Metzger said I was
gonna start hallucinating.

39:02.083 --> 39:05.753
Dr. Metzger's operation
is designed to lobotomize you,

39:05.836 --> 39:08.047
and part of you
already knows this is true.

39:08.131 --> 39:11.384
We all know when people are lying to us,
we just don't want to listen.

39:11.468 --> 39:16.222
The minute Metzger entered this room,
a voice inside of you told you to run.

39:16.306 --> 39:21.436
Right now you need to listen
to that voice, and get out of here.

39:23.187 --> 39:24.439
[knocking at door]

39:25.940 --> 39:28.025
Uh... [stammers]

39:29.068 --> 39:30.403
Hello?

39:30.487 --> 39:32.863
[knocking]

39:32.947 --> 39:34.991
[whispers] Amanita, is that you?

39:38.453 --> 39:41.122
Oh, my God.

39:41.205 --> 39:43.500
I-- I'm losing my mind.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.336
[knocking at door]

39:49.922 --> 39:52.342
[banging on door]

40:19.660 --> 40:21.620
[coins jingling]

40:25.333 --> 40:27.835
[phone ringtone plays]

40:52.776 --> 40:54.571
[slow blues playing]

40:54.653 --> 40:57.615
[man 1] You got some sack of balls
comin' in here.

40:57.698 --> 41:00.243
Hey, he's still my kid.

41:00.326 --> 41:02.537
[man 2] After what he did,
I'd disown the fuck.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.080
Can I talk to you?

41:04.163 --> 41:06.624
- You buyin'?
- Yeah, sure.

41:06.707 --> 41:09.168
- Round for everybody. [chuckles]
- All right.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.047
Step into my office.

41:13.130 --> 41:15.299
- I ain't drinkin' no traitor beer.
- I'll take his.

41:15.383 --> 41:19.011
- What?
- Beer is innocent. It don't take sides.

41:19.095 --> 41:21.556
You take my beer and I'll fuck you up.

41:21.639 --> 41:25.560
This goddamn thing's been
givin' me grief all day. [sighs]

41:26.477 --> 41:29.397
Do me a favor, Willy,
go take a shit for me.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.524
[men cackling]

41:33.025 --> 41:35.986
Yeah, I get it. You're pissed off
'cause I did my job.

41:36.070 --> 41:39.156
I tried to save that kid's life, Dad.
I'm just-- I'm gonna go.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.451
What? Sit down!

41:41.534 --> 41:44.454
God, you never had a sense of humor.

41:44.537 --> 41:45.913
Come on.

41:50.960 --> 41:54.004
You did what you felt
was the right thing.

41:54.088 --> 41:55.798
I'm proud of you for that.

41:58.134 --> 42:01.471
But if this punk
ends up killin' somebody,

42:01.554 --> 42:05.516
well then,
you gotta live with that, not me.

42:09.145 --> 42:10.647
But you know that.

42:10.729 --> 42:14.191
You didn't come all the way down here
to talk about that.

42:15.985 --> 42:18.488
This isn't easy to say, but I...

42:18.571 --> 42:21.115
I think you might be
the only one who's gonna believe me.

42:23.618 --> 42:26.579
Something's going on, Dad,

42:26.663 --> 42:29.123
and I think it's got somethin'
to do with Sara Patrell.

42:33.377 --> 42:34.753
Oh, boy.

42:38.215 --> 42:40.635
You're actually out of your fuckin' mind.

42:40.718 --> 42:43.721
[quiet scoff] I'm beginning to wonder.

42:44.681 --> 42:49.018
Look, forget about what you did
with that gangbanger.

42:49.101 --> 42:52.647
Forget about what these guys
might think of you.

42:52.730 --> 42:56.734
If you bring this girl up,
you start talkin' about her again,

42:56.817 --> 43:00.488
they'll drag you into psych evaluation
over the next six months.

43:00.571 --> 43:02.615
They'll run you off this force

43:02.699 --> 43:06.327
quicker than you could
scrape dog shit off your shoe.

43:07.328 --> 43:10.498
Let her go, Willy. Let her go.

43:13.543 --> 43:15.044
[phone ringing]

43:20.257 --> 43:22.719
- [ringing continues]
- [gasps]

43:23.927 --> 43:24.970
Don't.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.765
It's just in your head.
Don't answer it.

43:27.848 --> 43:30.184
[ringing continues]

43:36.148 --> 43:37.400
Hello?

43:37.483 --> 43:39.777
Oh, my God, it worked!

43:39.860 --> 43:42.405
- I found you finally.
- Amanita?

43:42.488 --> 43:44.948
I knew they had you on 18,
so I tried every room.

43:45.032 --> 43:47.702
[sniffling]
Oh, my God, where are-- Where are you?

43:47.785 --> 43:49.662
Here in the hospital.
They wouldn't let me see you.

43:49.746 --> 43:52.873
There's a ton of security on your floor,
but I knew Lola worked here

43:52.956 --> 43:55.752
- and she gave me her code.
- Gotta be quick, Neets.

43:55.834 --> 43:59.171
Listen, Nom,
I saw your crazy bitch mother.

43:59.255 --> 44:01.465
I don't know what she thinks
she's doing here, but--

44:01.549 --> 44:04.051
It's not just her.
There's this doctor.

44:04.134 --> 44:07.430
Yeah, Metzger.
He signed your papers.

44:07.513 --> 44:10.349
He said that there's
something wrong with my brain.

44:10.433 --> 44:13.310
And Neets,
bad things have been happening.

44:13.394 --> 44:14.645
What things?

44:14.729 --> 44:19.983
I've been hearing things
and feeling things and seeing things.

44:20.067 --> 44:21.569
Neets, I'm so scared.

44:21.652 --> 44:23.946
It's gonna be OK.
Something is going on.

44:24.029 --> 44:26.240
I don't know what it is,
but until we do,

44:26.323 --> 44:30.536
I will burn this building down before
I let anyone touch that beautiful brain.

44:30.620 --> 44:32.496
God, I love you.

44:33.997 --> 44:35.833
But what if he's right?

44:37.334 --> 44:39.962
Metzger said that I wouldn't
be able to tell the difference

44:40.045 --> 44:43.173
between a hallucination and reality,
and Neets,

44:43.257 --> 44:47.344
I saw the guy from my dream,
the one that I told you about.

44:48.345 --> 44:53.309
He was at the parade and...
and he was here my room.

44:53.392 --> 44:56.562
Persian guy? Leather jacket?

44:58.063 --> 45:01.859
- Did I tell you that?
- No.

45:01.942 --> 45:03.944
You were taking pictures
before you fainted.

45:04.027 --> 45:06.238
I got your phone here.

45:06.322 --> 45:10.284
Cameras don't hallucinate,
and that guy is staring right at you.

45:13.454 --> 45:15.331
[indistinct radio chatter]

45:15.414 --> 45:19.794
- We gotta go. We gotta go now.
- I'm gonna get you outta here, Nomi.

45:19.877 --> 45:21.128
I love you.

45:22.212 --> 45:23.673
[whispers] I love you, too.

45:28.344 --> 45:29.846
[exhaling]

45:35.893 --> 45:39.480
- [door bell dings]
- [slow-tempo music playing on radio]

45:41.774 --> 45:46.153
Hey, excuse me?
I'm just having some trouble sleeping.

45:46.236 --> 45:48.197
What kind of sleeping pills you guys sell?

45:48.280 --> 45:50.240
Somulex.

45:50.324 --> 45:52.409
That's my drug, bro.

45:52.493 --> 45:57.122
With a shot of bourbon,
totally knocks me out. Bam!

45:57.206 --> 45:59.917
But don't tell anyone
I told you that, 'cause like,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.419
you're not supposed
to take liquor with it.

46:02.503 --> 46:04.839
[whispers] But I totally dig the buzz.

46:06.590 --> 46:09.385
And it gives me major fucked up dreams.

46:09.468 --> 46:11.888
Fucked up dreams I got plenty of.

46:11.970 --> 46:14.181
Sure.

46:14.264 --> 46:16.266
We used to do these training courses,

46:16.350 --> 46:19.770
and they taught us
that drugs are like shoes.

46:19.854 --> 46:23.482
Everyone needs them,
but they don't always fit.

46:25.860 --> 46:28.654
- Hm.
- Second aisle to the left.

46:40.332 --> 46:41.959
[sighs]

47:11.321 --> 47:13.866
[flipping pages]

47:13.950 --> 47:15.826
[door bell dings]

47:31.008 --> 47:32.009
Hello.

47:33.970 --> 47:35.805
My name is Jonas.

47:35.888 --> 47:37.514
I know who you are.

47:37.598 --> 47:41.477
You know what they told you, and you
know what your senses are telling you.

47:41.560 --> 47:44.605
The question is, Will,
which of the two are you going to trust?

47:44.688 --> 47:46.148
How do you know my name?

47:46.231 --> 47:48.484
- She told me.
- Who?

47:48.567 --> 47:51.570
Angelica, the woman
that gave birth to you,

47:51.654 --> 47:53.489
just before she took her life.

47:53.572 --> 47:55.574
She shot herself.

47:55.658 --> 47:59.578
We all experience many births
and deaths during a life...

48:00.537 --> 48:04.792
but few know what it means
to be reborn a sensate.

48:04.875 --> 48:07.920
- A what?
- You have a migraine.

48:08.004 --> 48:09.922
You've had it since you saw her.

48:10.006 --> 48:11.799
It will last for several more days.

48:11.882 --> 48:15.011
When mine finally ended,
I cried like a baby,

48:15.093 --> 48:16.595
but that's just the beginning.

48:16.679 --> 48:18.555
You will start to feel strange things.

48:18.639 --> 48:21.017
You will feel snow
in the middle of the summer,

48:21.058 --> 48:24.061
rain when there isn't
a cloud in the sky.

48:24.144 --> 48:28.315
You'll feel anger and joy and pain.

48:29.149 --> 48:32.069
Pleasure without any reason.

48:33.737 --> 48:37.324
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Do you see this guy?

48:37.407 --> 48:39.493
I don't have much time, Will.

48:39.576 --> 48:42.038
There's a plane leaving in an hour
and I have to be on it.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.413
No, you're not going anywhere.

48:43.497 --> 48:45.958
There is a girl in San Francisco,
Nomi Marks.

48:46.042 --> 48:50.754
She needs your help,
just like Sara Patrell needed your help.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.094
I'm still a cop. I can't let you go.

48:57.177 --> 48:58.679
I'm not the enemy, Will.

48:58.762 --> 49:01.515
Quite a few governments
including this one says you are.

49:01.598 --> 49:04.935
You're about to go for the gun strapped
to your ankle, but by the time you do,

49:05.019 --> 49:07.437
the fight will be over.

49:10.148 --> 49:11.942
[Will grunts]

49:18.615 --> 49:20.367
[door bell dings]

49:21.326 --> 49:23.120
Not cool, man.
Should I call the cops?

49:23.203 --> 49:24.955
[Will] I am a cop.

49:25.039 --> 49:27.041
[tires screeching]

49:42.723 --> 49:45.059
[tires screech]

50:09.291 --> 50:11.877
- Don't do this, Will.
- What the fuck?!

50:11.961 --> 50:14.379
You've spent your life trying
to understand what happened to you.

50:14.463 --> 50:16.882
If you don't let me go,
you might never find out.

50:16.966 --> 50:20.594
- Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.
- No, it's just expanding.

50:21.011 --> 50:22.846
[crashing]

50:34.108 --> 50:36.110
[Jonas laughs]

50:37.903 --> 50:39.780
Well done.

50:39.863 --> 50:44.118
Yes, the connection flows both ways,
which raises the question:

50:44.201 --> 50:46.703
If you're here,
who's driving back there?

50:57.214 --> 50:59.967
- [tires screeching]
- [crashing]

51:03.679 --> 51:06.849
[dance song playing]
