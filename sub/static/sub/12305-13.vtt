WEBVTT

00:07.160 --> 00:09.162
Windsail key.

00:09.580 --> 00:14.710
Your one chance to purchase the only
publicly available atoll in the U.S.

00:14.751 --> 00:20.507
In essence,you'll be king,or
queen,of your own island.

00:20.549 --> 00:25.888
This is but one of eight secluded coves
affording you privacy within privacy.

00:25.929 --> 00:30.309
Half of them are warmed by
your own personal hot springs.

00:30.350 --> 00:37.399
Completely rebuilt and upgraded,windsail manor
is wired for senses you don't even have yet.

00:37.441 --> 00:41.278
Come on,julia,when have you ever known us
to buy anything without seeing it first?

00:41.320 --> 00:44.740
Oh,I really thought my
wall would seal the deal.

00:46.533 --> 00:50.370
tomorrow,at 8:00 promptly,our
catamaran will leave from the marina.

00:50.412 --> 00:56.210
You will deservedly be the first people to
set foot on windsail key since its rebirth.

00:56.251 --> 00:59.421
I'm happy to answer any
questions about the prospectus.

00:59.463 --> 01:01.548
Or the mojitos.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.217
Enjoy.

01:15.062 --> 01:16.563
I see you want it.

01:38.460 --> 01:40.921
just one second,please.

01:59.648 --> 02:00.857
hello?

02:05.404 --> 02:07.239
Is anybody there?

02:39.980 --> 02:41.440
horatio.

02:44.902 --> 02:46.028
This is bill winston.

02:46.069 --> 02:49.281
Billionaire
philanthropist,world traveler.

02:49.323 --> 02:51.408
And now murder victim.

02:51.450 --> 02:53.160
You are,ma'am?

02:55.954 --> 02:58.040
Pamela osborne.

02:58.081 --> 02:59.791
I can't believe this.

02:59.833 --> 03:02.669
She lives here,called it in.

03:02.711 --> 03:05.839
I take care of everything for
the winstons when they're in town.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.926
I heard a noise and found him like this.

03:10.093 --> 03:12.387
What was the event today?

03:12.429 --> 03:15.057
Bunch of billionaires
jockeying to buy an island.

03:15.098 --> 03:16.516
How well did you know these people?

03:16.558 --> 03:19.394
Only person I recognized was his lawyer.

03:19.478 --> 03:21.772
Mrs. Winston sells
high-end real estate,

03:21.813 --> 03:24.775
so buyers fly in from around the world.

03:24.816 --> 03:28.779
But trust me,this isn't
a group of killers.

03:28.904 --> 03:31.573
Well,someone was the
exception to the rule.

03:31.615 --> 03:34.284
Where is Mrs. Winston?

03:42.793 --> 03:44.836
I'm over here,john.

03:48.006 --> 03:51.134
But that's not your name anymore,is it?

03:51.593 --> 03:54.179
It's horatio caine.

03:59.142 --> 04:01.270
I like it.

04:04.898 --> 04:05.899
You know what,you can go now.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.943
Thank you very much.

04:14.116 --> 04:16.827
You know her,horatio?

04:16.869 --> 04:19.495
Mrs. Winston,frank...

04:19.538 --> 04:21.999
is Kyle's mother.

05:23.587 --> 05:26.048
You've known about Kyle?

05:26.173 --> 05:29.093
- For how long?
- Long enough,Julia.

05:29.427 --> 05:31.303
Long enough.

05:31.846 --> 05:37.309
I left him with my mom,always
planning to get him back.

05:37.351 --> 05:43.732
I wasn't equipped to raise him,and
I didn't want to burden you.

05:45.818 --> 05:47.153
Where is he now?

05:47.194 --> 05:49.321
He's in jail.

05:53.534 --> 05:55.703
Can I see him?

05:57.288 --> 05:59.081
When the time is right.

05:59.123 --> 06:01.917
We'll take care of this first,okay?

06:04.253 --> 06:07.089
I want you to tell me what happened.

06:08.007 --> 06:11.260
We got married in cairo two months ago.

06:11.469 --> 06:14.430
Just came from our house in europe.

06:14.472 --> 06:18.642
In a way,bill and I... just
started to know each other.

06:18.726 --> 06:21.687
I'm going to need
background on your guests.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.063
Of course.

06:42.958 --> 06:46.962
Hey,did you hear that,uh,alexx got in a
little fender bender on the causeway today?

06:47.004 --> 06:48.756
No. Is she okay?

06:48.798 --> 06:50.466
Yeah,thank goodness.

06:50.508 --> 06:51.759
I feel like today is so weird.

06:51.801 --> 06:53.302
Did you hear what else happened?

06:53.344 --> 06:57.807
Julia winston,the victim's
wife,is kyle's mother.

06:58.099 --> 06:59.892
Kyle,as in horatio's son?

06:59.934 --> 07:03.104
Yeah,and horatio had to tell
her that kyle was in jail.

07:03.145 --> 07:06.690
So that poor woman got bad news about
her husband and her son on the same day?

07:06.774 --> 07:07.858
I know.

07:07.900 --> 07:11.320
I feel like we should try
and get her some good news.

07:12.321 --> 07:17.535
All right... C.O.D. Is a
single gunshot to the chest.

07:17.576 --> 07:19.411
The defect appears to be front to back,

07:19.453 --> 07:22.581
so he would have been facing our killer.

07:28.963 --> 07:30.089
yeah,no blood.

07:30.131 --> 07:32.133
It's not through and through,so
the bullet would still be in him.

07:32.174 --> 07:33.884
Well,that's good news,because
if it's not too beat up,

07:33.926 --> 07:35.845
at least you'll have something to go on.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.934
got some blood here
that's been disturbed,

07:41.976 --> 07:44.895
which means somebody took
something from our crime scene.

07:51.777 --> 07:53.696
and it looks like he dropped a pen.

07:53.737 --> 07:57.658
Well,give a man something to sign
with,means he probably had something to sign.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.577
So they took some papers.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.835
It's engraved- it
says,"larry hopkins. "

08:07.877 --> 08:09.670
Practices law.

08:09.753 --> 08:12.214
Who better to break it?

08:12.506 --> 08:15.134
I'm going to go and pay him a visit.

08:20.473 --> 08:24.769
Mr. Hopkins,pamela
osborne,the house manager,

08:24.810 --> 08:27.730
told us that you were at the
house earlier today,is that true?

08:27.772 --> 08:29.064
It is.

08:29.106 --> 08:30.149
I'm bill winston's attorney.

08:30.191 --> 08:32.067
I brought him some papers to sign.

08:32.109 --> 08:38.323
Yeah,I have a photograph here of a void on Mr. Winston's
desk implying that some papers had been removed.

08:38.365 --> 08:40.326
You know anything about that?

08:42.787 --> 08:45.623
Bill insisted on
signing everything alone.

08:45.664 --> 08:47.625
He said it gave him clarity.

08:48.167 --> 08:50.836
So I was standing
outside waiting for him.

08:52.755 --> 08:55.549
Just one second,please.

08:57.635 --> 09:00.429
then I heard the gunshot,ran right in.

09:00.513 --> 09:02.723
bill? bill!

09:02.765 --> 09:04.975
never saw anyone go in or out.

09:05.017 --> 09:06.352
And then what happened?

09:06.393 --> 09:08.729
I collected his papers and left.

09:14.777 --> 09:16.612
You never called the police?

09:16.654 --> 09:19.406
No,I chose to get his affairs in order.

09:19.448 --> 09:23.577
Bill was a private man,and
it's o ob tmy jprotect him.

09:23.619 --> 09:26.122
Seems to me,Mr. Hopkins,that
you're protecting yourself.

09:26.163 --> 09:27.540
You left the scene of a crime.

09:27.581 --> 09:29.250
You can think what
you like,miss duquesne.

09:29.291 --> 09:31.794
Then I think I'd like
my evidence,please.

09:31.836 --> 09:35.798
Well,even though my client is
dead,he still has privilege.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.552
So... you're going to
need a warrant for that.

09:39.593 --> 09:41.512
Suit yourself,Mr. Hopkins.

09:41.554 --> 09:42.430
I'll get one.

09:42.471 --> 09:44.932
Until then,don't go anywhere.

09:44.974 --> 09:47.852
I'm posting uniforms here
and at your residence.

09:47.893 --> 09:49.979
Your life's on hold.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.156
As assistant state attorney,

10:00.197 --> 10:04.201
I'll be prosecuting kyle harmon
today,kathleen,in your kidnapping case.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.247
Okay.

10:08.414 --> 10:12.376
After sergeant tripp's testimony,you're
going to close the deal for us,okay?

10:12.418 --> 10:13.461
Okay.

10:13.502 --> 10:14.920
Listen.

10:14.962 --> 10:18.340
Show your emotions,but be strong.

10:18.424 --> 10:21.302
I'm not strong,miss nevins. I am...

10:21.552 --> 10:25.556
going through a divorce I can't afford,on
top of the bills that I can't pay.

10:25.598 --> 10:27.391
I understand that,but...

10:27.433 --> 10:30.936
that doesn't mean that
justice shouldn't be served.

10:31.645 --> 10:33.898
Kyle harmon forced you from your home,

10:33.981 --> 10:37.526
took you to a secret location
where he abandoned you.

10:43.991 --> 10:46.368
I know what I did was wrong.

10:47.286 --> 10:49.830
I'm really scared to go to trial.

10:51.624 --> 10:53.793
Well,don't be.

10:53.959 --> 10:55.169
Now,listen to me.

10:55.211 --> 11:00.633
The victim,kathleen newberry,is going
to keep the focus on you,you understand?

11:01.175 --> 11:02.718
Yes.

11:02.802 --> 11:06.597
I'm going to ask you if this is
the young man who kidnapped you.

11:07.264 --> 11:09.058
Can I just point to him?

11:09.100 --> 11:10.643
Absolutely.

11:11.310 --> 11:13.270
I think about it every day.

11:16.190 --> 11:20.402
Even though rick bates put that gun
to my head,I know what I did was wrong.

11:20.444 --> 11:24.240
Can I also tell the jury about
how my husband was behind all this?

11:25.116 --> 11:28.494
Your husband's already gone from
corrections officer to inmate.

11:28.536 --> 11:32.957
So now you need to focus on
making sure kyle joins him.

11:33.916 --> 11:35.876
Okay.

11:38.087 --> 11:39.463
What if they find me guilty?

11:39.505 --> 11:42.133
Hang on a second. Let's
not get ahead of ourselves.

11:42.174 --> 11:43.926
We're not there yet.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.436
Are you all right?

11:53.769 --> 11:55.062
I'm fine.

11:55.104 --> 11:56.480
What do you mean?

11:57.648 --> 11:59.400
About the trial,you just...

11:59.483 --> 12:01.068
you seem really,really upset.

12:01.110 --> 12:07.074
No,I just want to... I just want to
make sure you're prepared,that's all.

12:07.116 --> 12:08.909
Excuse me?

12:09.076 --> 12:12.204
So,I want you to get dressed.

12:15.416 --> 12:17.293
Dad?

12:18.169 --> 12:20.004
Are you going to be there?

12:20.045 --> 12:21.505
Of course I will.

12:23.132 --> 12:25.217
Now get dressed.

12:40.191 --> 12:42.610
All it needs is your signature.

12:42.693 --> 12:47.072
Wanted to make sure everything was
on the books before kyle's trial.

12:49.909 --> 12:51.202
I appreciate that,Frank.

13:03.214 --> 13:05.257
Who is this woman?

13:06.383 --> 13:08.260
She's kyle's mother.

13:08.302 --> 13:10.971
That's not what I'm asking.

13:13.682 --> 13:16.143
Who is she?

13:20.064 --> 13:23.567
John walden is a cover
name I used 16 years ago.

13:23.609 --> 13:27.196
I did some special task
force work in pensacola.

13:27.238 --> 13:29.824
That's when I met julia.

13:29.865 --> 13:32.159
Was it serious?

13:32.409 --> 13:34.370
It was for me.

13:38.749 --> 13:41.502
Custody's a big step,horatio.

13:43.254 --> 13:45.673
Yes,it is.

13:50.052 --> 13:52.388
Alexx,I got your message.

13:52.430 --> 13:53.305
How are we doing?

13:53.347 --> 13:57.977
Recovered the bullet between t7 and t8.

13:58.018 --> 14:01.021
It's mangled,distorted.

14:01.063 --> 14:04.525
Projectile entered through the sternum,

14:04.567 --> 14:09.113
passed through his aorta,up
to the thoracic vertebrae.

14:13.117 --> 14:16.036
That would mean that his lawyer
could've walked in and shot him.

14:16.078 --> 14:19.498
But not face-to-face,like
we thought.

14:19.540 --> 14:23.335
As I was going through
his clothes,eric,it hit me.

14:26.589 --> 14:27.965
There's no blood on it.

14:28.007 --> 14:30.217
And no defects.

14:30.259 --> 14:35.681
Based on the wound pattern there
should be something on the tie.

14:35.723 --> 14:37.183
There was a pen on the ground,right?

14:37.224 --> 14:39.018
Papers missing.

14:39.477 --> 14:42.730
He was getting ready to
sign something which means...

14:42.813 --> 14:44.356
he was leaning over.

14:48.277 --> 14:51.322
Okay,no way the killer
was lying on the floor.

14:51.363 --> 14:52.823
Bill would have seen him.

14:52.865 --> 14:54.200
Killer wasn't on the floor.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.868
The killer was under it.

14:55.910 --> 14:59.705
But there are no basements in miami.

14:59.747 --> 15:03.501
Alexx,money can buy you
a basement,if you want.

15:33.781 --> 15:37.660
This is the very first wine
cellar I've seen in miami.

15:37.701 --> 15:39.787
They had to have dug it right
out of the coastal ridge.

15:39.829 --> 15:42.665
This had to have cost a fortune.

15:42.706 --> 15:45.000
It cost him his life.

15:45.793 --> 15:50.297
I've positioned a bendie
where bill winston stood.

15:51.257 --> 15:54.009
With the laser,let's see what we get.

16:03.060 --> 16:05.312
This is the ac vent.

16:06.981 --> 16:10.609
Winston must have liked
it real cold at his desk.

16:10.651 --> 16:13.446
And the shooter stood right here.

16:15.656 --> 16:18.868
now confirm that with the laser.

16:20.536 --> 16:22.204
Bingo.

16:22.621 --> 16:24.540
Therite is.

16:25.958 --> 16:27.585
thanks

16:29.003 --> 16:31.422
What's that right there? Do you see it?

16:33.340 --> 16:35.009
It's blood and hair.

16:35.050 --> 16:37.928
Maybe we got lucky. Maybe our
shooter was clumsy and hit his head.

16:38.012 --> 16:39.305
Yeah,let's hope so.

16:43.267 --> 16:46.562
Hey,I need the results of that hair.

16:47.313 --> 16:50.524
I collect it,I run
it,and you're anxious?

16:50.566 --> 16:51.650
Yeah.

16:51.692 --> 16:53.986
No. I'm not done yet.

16:56.030 --> 16:58.199
Hey,did you hear that
kyle's case is up today?

16:58.240 --> 17:02.077
Yeah,that's right. Um,horatio's headed
over to the courtroom this afternoon.

17:02.119 --> 17:03.746
That poor kid.

17:03.788 --> 17:07.583
He's been used by everybody his whole life
and now he might spend the rest of it in jail.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.920
Well,I think if he gets
acquitted,horatio's going to get custody.

17:10.961 --> 17:14.131
Yeah,but even that might change now
that the mother's back in the picture.

17:14.673 --> 17:17.468
I trust kyle to make the right decision.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.261
Yeah,me,too.

17:19.303 --> 17:21.763
I expect nothing less from H.

17:22.138 --> 17:24.391
oh,here we go. We got a codis hit.

17:24.433 --> 17:25.768
Rob mason.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.186
He's in here for white-collar crimes.

17:28.229 --> 17:30.940
Looks like rob just made
it to the big leagues.

17:33.984 --> 17:37.321
So,how did you guys figure
out I was in the cellar?

17:37.363 --> 17:39.949
Because you left your hair behind.

17:42.409 --> 17:46.330
You guys... are good.

17:46.372 --> 17:49.166
I racked my head on that ceiling.

17:58.384 --> 17:59.844
See.

18:01.429 --> 18:03.264
Serves me right,I guess.

18:03.305 --> 18:05.766
Why were you in the basement?

18:06.809 --> 18:08.769
Do you like fine wine?

18:11.689 --> 18:14.442
This place is like
the tiffany's of wine.

18:14.525 --> 18:17.736
Bill always talked about
his 1905 blauschild bordeaux.

18:17.778 --> 18:20.364
So you had a taste?

18:20.406 --> 18:22.658
Nah,I wish i had the guts.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.660
Just wanted to say I'd seen it.

18:24.702 --> 18:26.829
Why open the vent?

18:29.623 --> 18:33.961
Okay. You got me.

18:35.379 --> 18:38.549
So I wasn't there for something vintage.

18:38.591 --> 18:40.593
Bill's always in that room.

18:40.634 --> 18:42.678
I was hoping to get a hot tip.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.889
Insider trading?

18:45.556 --> 18:50.311
You don't bank billions
playing by the rules,lieutenant.

18:50.352 --> 18:53.189
Besides,he never said a word.

18:54.273 --> 18:56.317
So you shot him.

18:56.609 --> 18:58.611
Why don't you slow down there.

18:58.652 --> 19:02.156
Okay,I've never fired a gun in my life.

19:02.198 --> 19:03.657
There's an easy way to prove that.

19:24.595 --> 19:27.098
Now I'm no scientist,

19:27.139 --> 19:31.435
but if I were guilty,that
should have changed color,right?

19:31.519 --> 19:32.686
Right.

19:33.896 --> 19:35.731
Right.

19:37.650 --> 19:39.318
Guess I'm out of here.

19:39.985 --> 19:41.821
Excuse me.

19:42.363 --> 19:44.782
Don't go far.

19:53.828 --> 19:56.164
Time to find out if
you're guilty,Mr. Hopkins.

19:56.247 --> 19:59.167
That's a search warrant for the papers
you took from bill winston's office.

19:59.209 --> 20:03.171
Okay,well,I have some clients coming in
shortly,but I will take a look at this...

20:03.213 --> 20:06.549
do it now or I tear your office apart.

20:07.509 --> 20:09.886
Do it now.

20:28.071 --> 20:29.656
These are annulment papers,H.

20:29.697 --> 20:32.617
Bill was going to dissolve
his marriage to julia

20:32.659 --> 20:35.537
based on the grounds that
julia had committed fraud.

20:35.578 --> 20:36.996
That's right.

20:37.205 --> 20:39.874
Just after they got married,bill
asked me to look into her.

20:39.916 --> 20:42.752
So you stumbled onto her past.

20:44.254 --> 20:49.134
She claimed to have made millions
in google,but she didn't have a dime.

20:49.175 --> 20:53.263
And we uncovered at least five different
identities that she used in the past.

20:56.224 --> 20:57.642
What tipped him off?

20:57.684 --> 20:58.977
The windsail key deal.

20:59.018 --> 21:01.646
She cut their honeymoon
short to close it.

21:01.688 --> 21:04.607
He figured anyone that concerned
with the payday must really need it.

21:04.649 --> 21:06.109
So,she was using him.

21:06.151 --> 21:08.236
In his world,everyone uses everyone.

21:08.278 --> 21:10.405
But the playing field's
gotta start level.

21:10.447 --> 21:13.032
Why go through with
windsail key auction at all?

21:13.074 --> 21:15.827
He was going to publicly
out her in front of everyone,

21:15.869 --> 21:18.371
so she couldn't dupe anyone in private.

21:18.621 --> 21:20.749
And she would be penniless.

21:20.790 --> 21:25.170
There appears to... be a lipstick
smudge on those. You don'T...

21:25.211 --> 21:26.588
no.

21:27.797 --> 21:29.090
Must be julia's then.

21:29.132 --> 21:31.468
That means she knows that he
was going to end their marriage.

21:31.509 --> 21:34.345
And that is called motive.

21:39.350 --> 21:41.519
Uniforms went to the
house,and julia's not there.

21:41.561 --> 21:42.353
What about her cell phone?

21:42.395 --> 21:43.938
It's turned off.

21:43.980 --> 21:44.981
Turned off.

21:45.023 --> 21:46.107
Okay. I've got an idea.

21:46.149 --> 21:47.942
Thank you,Mr. Wolfe.

21:47.984 --> 21:49.527
Yes,this is lieutenant caine.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.404
Kyle harmon please.

21:51.446 --> 21:52.822
Lieutenant,he's got a visi tor.

21:52.864 --> 21:55.366
Okay,what is the name of the visitor?

21:57.160 --> 21:58.328
Julia winston.

21:58.411 --> 22:00.538
Julia winston. Keep her there.

22:04.918 --> 22:07.170
I always knew you'd come back.

22:12.050 --> 22:16.638
I whispered that promise in
your ear the last time I saw you.

22:16.721 --> 22:17.889
Really?

22:20.433 --> 22:22.936
I'll never leave you again.

22:27.148 --> 22:30.151
I can't believe no one
taught you how to do this.

22:30.235 --> 22:33.321
Yeah. Well,I've never really worn a tie.

22:33.363 --> 22:35.657
Brings out the blue in your eyes.

22:36.491 --> 22:39.160
I'll teach you how to
do it when you get out.

22:39.744 --> 22:41.746
That's if I ever get out.

22:41.830 --> 22:43.790
I don't want to hear that.

22:44.457 --> 22:47.085
Everything is going to be fine.

22:47.127 --> 22:50.672
- You didn't hurt anybody,did you?
- No,but I...

22:50.713 --> 22:54.801
and I'm sure that woman
understands that you made a mistake.

22:54.843 --> 22:57.554
We all make mistakes,don't we?

22:57.846 --> 23:00.140
Yeah,I guess.

23:08.940 --> 23:09.983
Look at that.

23:10.066 --> 23:12.152
So handsome.

23:14.237 --> 23:16.531
Like your father.

23:19.033 --> 23:21.494
Could I have a word,julia?

23:23.496 --> 23:24.497
Of course.

23:24.539 --> 23:26.666
Outside,please.

23:28.543 --> 23:31.087
Don't forget my promise.

23:31.379 --> 23:32.922
Okay.

23:39.471 --> 23:41.890
What are you doing?

23:42.974 --> 23:45.518
I'm visiting our son.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.313
You failed to mention his trial today.

23:48.354 --> 23:50.231
I wanted to support him.

23:52.317 --> 23:57.739
And you failed to mention you've used
five aliases over the last 15 years.

23:59.407 --> 24:02.410
When I met you,you were
undercover for a living.

24:02.452 --> 24:05.330
But I'm a cop.

24:05.371 --> 24:08.750
You found out about the
annulment,didn't you?

24:11.002 --> 24:16.216
I stopped by the lawyer's last night
to go over the deal for the island sale.

24:16.591 --> 24:18.843
Saw it on the table.

24:19.844 --> 24:20.720
I'm going to go get some coffee.

24:20.762 --> 24:22.514
- Would you like some?
- Please.

24:42.742 --> 24:47.914
And it was at that moment that you realized
that you were about to lose everything.

24:49.541 --> 24:51.209
what are you implying?

24:51.251 --> 24:52.460
You called,horatio?

24:52.544 --> 24:54.170
Check her car,please,frank.

24:54.212 --> 24:55.213
You bet.

24:56.214 --> 24:58.925
You really think i killed my husband?

24:59.134 --> 25:01.261
I guess we're going
to find out,aren't we?

25:18.695 --> 25:20.321
Horatio?

25:22.615 --> 25:24.951
I have no idea how that got there.

25:25.869 --> 25:28.079
Hook her up,please.

25:28.371 --> 25:29.831
Yup.

25:34.294 --> 25:36.045
You're wasting your time.

25:36.087 --> 25:37.756
Why is that?

25:38.131 --> 25:41.134
Because you still love me.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.240
I heard horatio may have
found the murder weapon.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.450
Yeah,in julia winston's mercedes.

26:28.492 --> 26:29.368
How diabolical.

26:29.410 --> 26:31.203
You know,if her husband
had signed the annulment,

26:31.245 --> 26:33.747
she wouldn't have anything,and
now,she's a wealthy widow.

26:33.789 --> 26:35.040
Hang on,calleigh,okay?

26:35.082 --> 26:36.750
Let's just see what
the evidence tells us.

26:36.792 --> 26:37.960
Okay.

26:39.128 --> 26:41.338
Now,I got some pressure
distortion,there,

26:41.380 --> 26:44.800
but,uh,think I've got
enough to make a comparison.

26:44.842 --> 26:47.511
I know that julia is a savvy con artist,

26:47.553 --> 26:50.514
but I'm thinking,she's
probably a rookie killer.

26:50.556 --> 26:54.226
You're so sure of yourself that
I am going to let you confirm it.

26:54.268 --> 26:55.811
My pleasure.

26:56.687 --> 26:58.647
Ten-card's right there.

27:09.241 --> 27:12.453
Okay,this print that you
gave me is not julia'S.

27:13.328 --> 27:15.873
I said it. Told you she was framed.

27:16.457 --> 27:20.210
Want to widen the search,run
it through afis,see what we get.

27:23.547 --> 27:25.257
I got something.

27:25.799 --> 27:26.884
Rob mason.

27:26.925 --> 27:28.510
The guy in the basement.

27:28.552 --> 27:29.345
Thanks.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.263
I'll bring him in.

27:42.983 --> 27:45.069
Positive for gunshot residue.

27:45.110 --> 27:46.487
That's got to be wrong.

27:46.528 --> 27:48.405
Stand up,please.

27:52.326 --> 27:54.828
Turn out your pants pockets inside out.

28:04.546 --> 28:07.216
That's positive twice,Mr. Mason.

28:35.786 --> 28:38.247
I was tested earlier,it was
negative. How could that happen?

28:38.288 --> 28:41.291
You put your hand back in your
pocket after you fired the weapon.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.961
Then you scrubbed your
hands before you came in.

28:51.719 --> 28:55.389
now that everything's out
on the table,why'd you do it?

28:57.933 --> 28:59.935
Things were starting to come apart.

28:59.977 --> 29:01.186
What was coming apart?

29:01.270 --> 29:04.565
I spent years bribing and embezzling
my way into the inner circle,

29:04.648 --> 29:07.151
and I'm finally rubbing
elbows with billionaires,

29:07.192 --> 29:10.237
and the help goes and screws it up.

29:17.077 --> 29:19.288
Tim gilbert.

29:19.329 --> 29:21.999
Sorry. You must have me
confused with someone else.

29:22.082 --> 29:26.170
Come on,tim. We worked at
ellicot house cleaners,remember?

29:30.049 --> 29:31.967
That was a long time ago.

29:32.009 --> 29:33.594
Yeah.

29:33.635 --> 29:35.471
What are you doing here?

29:39.016 --> 29:42.603
What does that have to do
with your killing bill winston?

29:43.687 --> 29:46.774
Julia came to me with a deal.

29:46.857 --> 29:52.571
She would not out me as a
fraud if I did her a favor.

29:55.824 --> 29:57.576
You want me to kill your husband?

29:57.618 --> 30:00.704
The gun will be here,bill
will be upstairs.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.499
I don't know. I can'T... i
can't do this. I'm not a killer.

30:03.540 --> 30:04.333
Now,calm down.

30:04.375 --> 30:06.293
He'll never even see you.

30:06.335 --> 30:09.338
One clean shot.

30:09.380 --> 30:11.340
Then leave the gun,and
I'll take care of it.

30:11.382 --> 30:13.550
When you're done,get back to the party.

30:13.592 --> 30:15.719
What makes you think
I would kill someone?

30:15.761 --> 30:19.556
You lied your way in here so
you could be one of the big boys.

30:19.807 --> 30:21.558
so be one.

30:24.436 --> 30:26.563
she left me no choice.

30:26.605 --> 30:29.149
Why don't you tell me what you
did with the gun after that?

30:30.901 --> 30:32.111
I left it there for julia.

30:32.152 --> 30:33.779
She said she'd take care of it.

30:33.821 --> 30:35.364
By hiding it in her own car?

30:35.406 --> 30:37.074
I don't think so.

30:37.116 --> 30:40.619
I'm telling you,julia's the
one behind this entire thing.

30:42.121 --> 30:45.290
You may be telling the truth,Mr. Mason,

30:45.374 --> 30:48.127
but we have no physical evidence
tying julia to the crime,

30:48.168 --> 30:53.257
so,unfortunately for
you,she's played you perfectly.

30:59.388 --> 31:01.765
The young man surrendered
without resistance

31:01.807 --> 31:04.601
and has complied with all
that's been asked of him since.

31:04.643 --> 31:07.896
But he did take her to
a secondary location.

31:07.938 --> 31:09.148
That's correct.

31:09.982 --> 31:17.114
Um,and to reconfirm,that is the
man who abducted kathleen newberry.

31:19.324 --> 31:20.951
Yes,it is.

31:20.993 --> 31:23.829
These questions have
been asked and answered.

31:23.871 --> 31:26.749
If there's nothing else,let's move on.

31:29.001 --> 31:30.919
Thank you,sergeant tripp. That's all.

31:30.961 --> 31:32.004
Witness is excused.

31:32.046 --> 31:33.505
Thank you,judge.

31:34.381 --> 31:36.675
Miss nevins,your next witness?

31:36.717 --> 31:40.012
The victim in this
case,kathleen newberry.

31:45.559 --> 31:47.478
She's scheduled for 11:30.

31:47.519 --> 31:49.188
Let's proceed.

31:52.858 --> 31:55.486
Your honor,as her testimony
promises to be long,

31:55.527 --> 31:58.822
the state requests we break
for lunch before calling her in.

31:58.864 --> 32:00.616
Court rwillesume in 90 minutes.

32:00.657 --> 32:03.035
The defendant is remanded into custody.

32:08.624 --> 32:11.210
so,kathleen newberry's a no-show,huh?

32:11.251 --> 32:14.088
Yeah. No one can find
her,which helps kyle,of course.

32:14.129 --> 32:16.048
I'll send my team up there right now.

32:16.090 --> 32:17.800
Thank you,horatio.

32:25.391 --> 32:28.185
- Did I hear her say her witness is missing?
- You did.

32:28.227 --> 32:30.437
Where's kathleen,julia?

32:30.479 --> 32:31.730
Why are you asking me that?

32:31.772 --> 32:37.486
I'm asking you because you petitioned for
custody this morning hours before this proceeding.

32:37.528 --> 32:38.404
Of course I did.

32:38.445 --> 32:39.947
I'd do anything for him now.

32:39.988 --> 32:41.949
And that's my point.

33:02.553 --> 33:05.180
Looks like Mrs. Newberry
was having a rough go of it.

33:05.222 --> 33:07.057
There's a foreclosure here.

33:07.099 --> 33:09.476
Some past due bills.

33:15.858 --> 33:17.776
Kathleen,this is assistant
state attorney nevins.

33:17.818 --> 33:19.695
But you know what? There's
no sign of forced entry.

33:19.737 --> 33:22.781
There's no signs of a struggle.

33:25.117 --> 33:27.536
What about the voice mail?

33:27.578 --> 33:32.374
Yeah. There are,uh... there
are over a dozen of them.

33:34.126 --> 33:37.046
Most of them are from asa nevins.

33:41.091 --> 33:43.302
Looks like she packed in a hurry.

33:57.608 --> 33:59.651
hey,come check this out.

34:04.406 --> 34:06.700
She left one bag behind,huh?

34:10.286 --> 34:12.039
It's a currency band.

34:12.121 --> 34:13.331
$10,000.

34:13.415 --> 34:16.960
Yeah,she could've fit a
hundred of those in here.

34:17.085 --> 34:20.214
So it looks like kathleen
newberry just became a millionaire.

34:30.683 --> 34:32.976
Something oily on the bottom of the bag.

34:33.018 --> 34:35.228
Hopefully trace can tell us something.

34:35.270 --> 34:37.022
Like where all that cash came from.

34:37.063 --> 34:40.442
My guess,it's from someone who
benefited from her disappearance.

34:56.958 --> 34:59.378
I'm sorry,Mrs. Winston
isn't available right now.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.980
She's had a very difficult day.

34:59.022 --> 35:02.191
Well,actually,I came to talk to
you because you run the house.

35:02.233 --> 35:04.736
In exchange for living
here when they're gone.

35:04.777 --> 35:06.404
I do everything when they're in town.

35:06.446 --> 35:09.115
Well,we found a bag today
at kathleen newberry's house,

35:09.157 --> 35:12.285
and it had traces of acrylic
polymer and butyl carbitol.

35:12.327 --> 35:13.536
What are those?

35:13.578 --> 35:17.040
They're cleaning solvents for marble
floors,which kathleen doesn't have.

35:17.081 --> 35:19.125
But you do,in every room.

35:19.167 --> 35:21.961
We're not the only home in miami
who has them,miss boa vista.

35:22.003 --> 35:25.548
No,but you're the only one with
motive for kathleen to disappear.

35:25.590 --> 35:29.010
Mrs. Winston's been in court all day; she
couldn't have had anything to do with it.

35:29.052 --> 35:30.428
Well,see again,that's why
I wanted to talk to you

35:30.470 --> 35:32.847
because since your boss
just inherited millions,

35:32.889 --> 35:35.516
I think she sent you
to pay off kathleen.

35:35.558 --> 35:38.686
Not that I did,but what would
be wrong with such kindness?

35:38.728 --> 35:42.774
Giving a woman who's fallen on hard
times a chance at a fresh start.

35:42.815 --> 35:44.776
Someone did her a great service.

35:44.817 --> 35:46.277
"Someone"?

35:46.319 --> 35:48.154
I think you're behind it.

35:48.196 --> 35:50.239
The best charity is anonymous.

35:50.281 --> 35:53.826
That might be true,but I
doubt that it was charitable.

35:55.995 --> 35:58.164
Do you have a body?

35:58.831 --> 36:01.834
Are you saying there is one?

36:02.377 --> 36:05.880
If I have done anything,then
I helped a woman in need.

36:05.922 --> 36:10.301
If you want to talk about this more,I'll
be in court looking after my son.

36:18.559 --> 36:22.397
Criminal court department
b is now called to order.

36:22.438 --> 36:24.107
All rise.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.664
Okay,counsel.

36:39.706 --> 36:41.457
Your next witness.

36:42.709 --> 36:46.129
Your honor,permission
to approach the bench.

36:46.713 --> 36:48.673
Sidebar.

37:04.856 --> 37:08.067
I have been informed by assistant
state attorney nevins that

37:08.109 --> 37:11.487
the prosecution's key
witness is unavailable,

37:11.529 --> 37:14.282
and the state is not able to proceed.

37:14.324 --> 37:18.703
I,therefore,have no choice but to
dismiss this matter without prejudice.

37:19.662 --> 37:21.539
So I'm free?

37:21.664 --> 37:23.374
You are,Mr. Harmon.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.877
Upon discharge from the
miami-dade department of detention,

37:25.918 --> 37:27.295
you are released to your parents,

37:27.337 --> 37:30.965
both of whom have filed
separate petitions for custody.

37:31.841 --> 37:34.093
So I have to choose?

37:35.094 --> 37:37.639
Yes,son,you do.

37:40.391 --> 37:42.185
Court adjourned.

38:10.129 --> 38:15.551
I'm no lawyer,but if kathleen newberry
doesn't show up,kyle can't be retried,right?

38:15.593 --> 38:20.515
That's correct,but I'm
going to find her,julia.

38:20.556 --> 38:24.769
And when I do,we're going to have to
start this whole process over again.

38:24.811 --> 38:27.563
Why would you want to put
your own son back in jail?

38:27.605 --> 38:31.859
I'm,uh... not actually
talking about my son.

38:39.450 --> 38:40.451
Hey.

38:41.286 --> 38:42.704
Do you have a twenty on tripp?

38:42.745 --> 38:43.955
I can't seem to get ahold of him.

38:43.997 --> 38:49.002
No,but manchester and missing persons got a court order
to access the the department of transportation records.

38:49.043 --> 38:52.046
Turns out kathleen has
a sunpass in her car.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.361
So there are records at every
toll plaza of her sailing through.

39:15.403 --> 39:16.321
She's in a hurry,too.

39:16.362 --> 39:17.447
She's hit a lot of them.

39:17.488 --> 39:21.075
She's north of boca raton,which means
she's headed way outside our jurisdiction.

39:21.117 --> 39:23.953
So what if julia's telling the truth
and kathleen did take the money and run?

39:23.995 --> 39:26.289
Maybe,but I've got a bad feeling.

39:36.341 --> 39:38.426
Man,it feels so good to be out.

39:38.468 --> 39:40.762
Let's keep it that way,okay?

39:44.724 --> 39:49.854
Son... I can't tell you not to do this.

39:52.732 --> 39:55.860
My whole life I've been
moving from place to place.

39:55.902 --> 39:57.862
Okay,with nothing,not even a photograph.

39:57.904 --> 39:59.614
All I have is what I can remember.

39:59.656 --> 40:00.740
Listen,kyle,that's not true.

40:00.782 --> 40:02.075
You have your freedom now.

40:02.116 --> 40:04.744
I suggest you take care of it.

40:10.166 --> 40:12.585
You loved her once,right?

40:20.176 --> 40:22.804
I just need that chance to try.

40:28.101 --> 40:29.936
I understand.

40:30.645 --> 40:33.064
You stay in touch,though.

40:34.148 --> 40:35.984
I will.

40:56.587 --> 40:58.464
You take care of him.

40:58.548 --> 41:00.049
I'm his mother.
