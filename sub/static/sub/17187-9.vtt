-He's not the monster we just buried.
-Let's hope he doesn't become one.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.725
Do you remember any of it?

37:09.019 --> 37:11.145
Even a flash?

37:13.189 --> 37:14.690
No.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.650
Nothing.

37:17.319 --> 37:20.362
It was all we talked about, Derek.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.073
What he'd done.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.160
How you were gonna find him
one day.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.162
You were obsessed.

37:33.501 --> 37:36.045
It was a trauma. You've blocked it.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.549
Maybe. Maybe not.

37:45.055 --> 37:47.765
-Maybe it never happened to me.
-Derek.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.185
I was there.

37:54.856 --> 37:57.441
Maybe I came from a future
where it never happened...

37:57.609 --> 38:01.487
...and now you've come
from a future where it did.

38:03.031 --> 38:05.532
Is that possible?

38:08.703 --> 38:12.456
Ever since I've been back here,
I've done...

38:13.249 --> 38:16.585
...things. I've changed things.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.549
Maybe I changed the future.

38:24.344 --> 38:27.471
That's why we're here, isn't it?
To change the future.

38:31.768 --> 38:35.479
Do you think there's a version of
the future where we're not together?

No.

-Yeah.

FBI, Department of Homeland Security.
Need you to come with us, please.

39:22.569 --> 39:26.947
Two nights ago, you entered
the building, unauthorized, at 4:16 a.m.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.074
What were you doing here?

39:29.242 --> 39:30.909
That's a mistake.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.203
Two nights ago? No.

39:33.621 --> 39:37.708
I wasn't there. I would have no reason
to be there at that time.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.877
Computers don't lie, Mr. Fischer.

39:44.132 --> 39:47.301
At 4:23, seven minutes
after you entered the building...

39:47.469 --> 39:51.263
...there was an unauthorized access
to the computer networking system.

39:51.598 --> 39:54.933
FISCHER: That wasn't me.
-This system allows the user access...

39:55.101 --> 39:58.562
...to all primary military-industrial
complex computer systems.

that this is all a big mistake.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.235
I do seismic retrofitting.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.615
I don't know how
to access a computer system.

Why would I do that?

I don't know, Mr. Fischer.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.245
You tell me.

40:16.122 --> 40:19.458
Why would you install a roving
backdoor into those computer systems?

40:19.626 --> 40:23.170
One that we can't dismantle so far.
You wanna tell us how to do that?

40:24.297 --> 40:26.840
I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.926
I wasn't there.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.970
What happened to you?
You look a little banged up.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.306
You wanna explain that?

I don't know if I can.

Try.

So...

41:01.668 --> 41:04.044
...what is it you wanted to show me?
