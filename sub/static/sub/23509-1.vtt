WEBVTT

02:09.137 --> 02:11.889
In His infinite wisdom,
the Lord has seen fit

02:12.056 --> 02:15.475
to take from us
a just and courageous friend.

02:15.643 --> 02:18.478
That Simon Cordier
in the prime of his manhood

02:18.646 --> 02:20.480
should have come to his death as he did,

02:20.648 --> 02:23.942
makes his passing even a greater shock

02:24.152 --> 02:27.321
to those he has left behind.

02:27.530 --> 02:31.200
As one of France's
most respected magistrates,

02:31.367 --> 02:35.871
Simon Cordier dedicated his life
to the betterment of humanity.

02:36.039 --> 02:41.752
All that Simon Cordier was
can be summed up in these words:

02:41.920 --> 02:43.921
He was a good man.

02:44.088 --> 02:47.757
May God have mercy on his soul.

02:58.603 --> 03:00.862
Make him Eternal...

03:45.566 --> 03:48.986
All those fine words. I'm glad he's dead.

03:50.488 --> 03:53.240
Mr. D'Arville, Miss Jeanne.

03:53.408 --> 03:55.909
It was Magistrate Cordier's wish
before he died

03:56.077 --> 03:58.829
that we all assemble after the funeral.

03:58.997 --> 04:02.833
My daughter and I are willing
to respect the wishes of the dead.

04:03.001 --> 04:05.502
More so than if he were living.

04:06.587 --> 04:08.422
We will see you at the gallery, then.

04:08.589 --> 04:10.549
Yes.

04:23.646 --> 04:26.315
Why Magistrate Cordier
should have entrusted this task

04:26.482 --> 04:29.443
to my daughter and to me, I do not know.

04:29.610 --> 04:32.529
Our feelings toward him are no secret.

04:33.906 --> 04:39.077
As Father Borman knows,
this chest and the letter

04:39.287 --> 04:42.122
were given to my daughter
by Magistrate Cordier

04:42.332 --> 04:44.666
the night he died.

04:44.834 --> 04:48.712
The letter written by the Magistrate
says that if he died that night,

04:48.880 --> 04:52.841
then, this chest must not be opened
until immediately after the funeral.

04:53.009 --> 04:55.370
But why would he think he might die?

04:55.470 --> 04:56.928
Surely, it was an accident.

04:57.096 --> 05:01.099
Father Borman, my investigation
proved that it was not suicide.

05:01.934 --> 05:05.395
The letter requested that we be present
when the chest is opened,

05:05.563 --> 05:08.398
since it involved matters
important to all of you.

05:08.566 --> 05:11.651
The chest, Mr. D'Arville, please.

05:20.661 --> 05:22.788
A book?

05:24.499 --> 05:27.167
It seems to be a personal diary.

05:27.752 --> 05:29.544
And a note.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.924
"I speak to you from the grave."

05:37.428 --> 05:40.555
"In the sanctuary of my coffin,
I can state certain facts

05:40.723 --> 05:42.891
which I could not do while I was alive.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.395
If I had attempted to do so
before my death,

05:46.562 --> 05:49.314
I would have been judged insane,

05:49.482 --> 05:52.567
and my warning to mankind
would have gone unheeded."

05:52.735 --> 05:54.762
Warning?

05:54.862 --> 05:56.405
What do you know about this?

05:56.572 --> 05:58.240
Nothing, I swear it, Captain.

05:58.449 --> 06:00.700
I did not know the Magistrate
even kept a diary.

06:00.868 --> 06:01.952
That is the truth.

06:03.621 --> 06:07.040
"Do not regard with cynicism
what you learn now.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.751
Once you have heard
the contents of my diary,

06:09.919 --> 06:12.546
the future will be in your hands.

06:12.713 --> 06:17.467
God be with you,
for you will need His help."

06:19.971 --> 06:23.849
Perhaps that is why the Magistrate
wanted you to be here.

06:24.934 --> 06:26.810
Please, Mr. D'Arville, the diary.

06:33.651 --> 06:37.237
September 17, 1886.

06:38.114 --> 06:41.867
The strange events
which occasion me to begin this diary

06:42.034 --> 06:46.455
started three days
before the murderer Louis Girot

06:46.622 --> 06:48.665
was to go to the guillotine.

06:48.833 --> 06:53.462
And police captain Rennedon
came to my chambers at the tribune.

06:56.090 --> 06:56.908
Oh, Captain.

06:57.008 --> 06:58.633
Is Magistrate Cordier busy?

06:58.801 --> 07:00.969
He's just come from the court.

07:02.805 --> 07:04.639
Come in.

07:04.807 --> 07:06.224
Captain Rennedon, sir.

07:06.434 --> 07:08.643
Oh, tell him to come in.

07:11.439 --> 07:12.981
- Well, Robert.
- Simon.

07:13.149 --> 07:16.844
This is a pleasure, unless, of course,
you've brought me trouble.

07:16.944 --> 07:21.448
I don't think I have, considering your
endless studies of the criminal mind,

07:21.616 --> 07:24.018
which I'll never understand.

07:24.118 --> 07:27.287
It concerns Louis Girot.
He wants to talk to you.

07:27.497 --> 07:30.624
Oh, does he want to change
the testimony he gave at the trial?

07:30.791 --> 07:32.292
A strange fish, Girot.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.920
It's hard to tell what he wants.

07:35.630 --> 07:38.757
Well, he goes to the guillotine
in three days.

07:38.925 --> 07:39.966
Perhaps it's his conscience.

07:40.134 --> 07:41.885
A confession?

07:42.053 --> 07:44.221
Maybe. It is possible.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.851
As you say, he is a strange fish.

07:50.019 --> 07:54.064
Girot murdered four people,
without motivation.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.108
He didn't know any of them.
He didn't rob them.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.778
He just killed.

08:00.821 --> 08:03.657
Yes, the case is most perplexing.

08:03.824 --> 08:06.243
Which means that you're curious
enough to see him.

08:06.410 --> 08:09.913
To me, a thief is a thief,
a murderer is a murderer.

08:10.081 --> 08:12.165
Life is much simpler that way.

08:13.584 --> 08:15.544
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

08:21.050 --> 08:23.176
There we are.

08:30.726 --> 08:31.810
I'd better go in with you.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.688
No, he might talk more if we were alone.

08:34.855 --> 08:37.899
All right, I'll wait here. Guard.

08:52.957 --> 08:57.210
Magistrate Cordier, thank you for coming.

08:58.629 --> 09:02.132
It's the only hospitality I can offer you.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.345
Captain Rennedon believed

09:07.555 --> 09:10.348
you might be ready
to make a statement, Girot.

09:10.558 --> 09:13.852
A statement? Perhaps.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.980
But what is it you want me to say?

09:17.148 --> 09:19.232
Something I did not say at the trial?

09:19.400 --> 09:21.568
If there is truth in it.

09:22.820 --> 09:25.447
Can't you understand, Magistrate?

09:25.656 --> 09:29.185
I told the truth at the trial.

09:29.285 --> 09:30.702
I swear to you.

09:31.370 --> 09:34.789
It was something that... that used me.

09:35.916 --> 09:39.294
Just as if it took my body
and made me murder.

09:39.462 --> 09:43.757
Please, Girot, you seem to be
a man of some intelligence.

09:47.219 --> 09:52.223
And in three days, my intelligence
will be chopped off at the neck.

09:54.268 --> 09:57.437
Do you think that I would go on lying,

09:57.688 --> 09:59.105
knowing that I'm going to die?

09:59.273 --> 10:03.234
But a man doesn't kill four people
without reason.

10:03.402 --> 10:07.139
It was a thing that possessed me
that had the reason.

10:07.239 --> 10:11.576
It lives on evil
and grows stronger and stronger.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.912
Please, Girot, sit down.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.249
I didn't even know until afterward
that I had killed.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.961
It had control of my mind.
I had no will of my own.

10:22.213 --> 10:24.255
It forced me to murder.

10:24.882 --> 10:27.050
I couldn't accept this testimony before.

10:27.218 --> 10:29.177
Do you expect me to believe it now?

10:31.180 --> 10:34.432
I had never thought that hatred is evil.

10:34.642 --> 10:37.686
- Hatred is evil.
- But that's in you.

10:37.853 --> 10:42.440
And it used that to feed on my will
until it owned me.

10:42.650 --> 10:46.095
Girot, I'm sorry, I had hoped
you'd be able to give me some...

10:46.195 --> 10:50.407
But do you know why
I never asked for a new trial?

10:53.452 --> 10:55.662
I want to die.

10:55.871 --> 11:02.871
Because so long as I live,
the thing can make me kill again.

11:05.005 --> 11:10.009
Girot, what is it? Your eyes...

11:10.678 --> 11:13.388
It can even make me...

11:14.807 --> 11:17.392
kill you!

11:17.560 --> 11:19.394
Girot!

11:23.399 --> 11:25.275
Guard!

11:36.370 --> 11:37.495
He tried to kill me.

11:37.705 --> 11:41.291
I warned you, murderers,
they're all the same.

11:41.459 --> 11:44.294
Humanity would be much better off
without them.

11:45.045 --> 11:47.630
Call the doctor, hurry!

11:49.550 --> 11:51.593
Is he badly hurt?

11:56.015 --> 11:59.350
There'll be no need
to chop in the guillotine.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.186
Dead?

12:01.353 --> 12:03.521
But it was so sudden.

12:03.731 --> 12:07.692
One moment he was
completely rational, and then...

12:08.444 --> 12:11.279
This is terrible, Robert, I...

12:11.447 --> 12:13.406
If anything, I wanted to help him.

12:13.574 --> 12:16.159
You had to defend yourself.
It was an accident.

12:16.327 --> 12:20.038
Besides, I'd say you did help him.

12:20.206 --> 12:23.458
This is a much easier way to die.

12:30.382 --> 12:33.593
For the next two days, I returned
home from my work at the court

12:33.803 --> 12:37.555
with the death of the murderer Girot
still on my mind.

12:37.765 --> 12:40.099
Despite Rennedon's assurance
of my innocence,

12:40.267 --> 12:43.228
somehow the accident still disturbed me,

12:43.395 --> 12:45.939
and I could not rid myself
of the depression

12:46.106 --> 12:48.608
that weighed so heavily.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.367
- Good evening, sir.
- Good morning, Pierre.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.955
Sir, I'll tell you Louise's secret.

13:02.122 --> 13:04.666
She's preparing your favorite dinner,
baked lamb!

13:04.875 --> 13:10.171
Oh, that's fine, but I...
I think I need a cognac before.

13:10.339 --> 13:12.924
- In the study, please.
- Yes, sir.

13:30.317 --> 13:34.904
Well, Kiki, you're in fine voice.

13:35.072 --> 13:37.657
You must have been practicing all day.

13:37.867 --> 13:40.394
And just because you've been
so industrious,

13:40.494 --> 13:44.581
you, too, are going
to have a special dinner.

13:46.709 --> 13:48.784
There you are.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.562
Pierre!

14:11.275 --> 14:13.151
Sir.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.153
Why did you put this back in here?

14:15.321 --> 14:18.948
I...? But I haven't even seen it
since you...

14:19.116 --> 14:20.533
Would I do such a thing?

14:20.701 --> 14:23.479
But it was hanging there
on the wall, Pierre.

14:23.579 --> 14:24.621
Who's been in the house?

14:24.788 --> 14:27.206
Only Louise and myself.

14:37.259 --> 14:40.303
Pierre, what is it? What has happened?

14:40.471 --> 14:43.431
I... I'm not sure.

14:43.599 --> 14:47.560
You remember the large photograph
of Mrs. Cordier and the boy?

14:47.728 --> 14:50.271
Oh, the one that used to be in the study?

14:50.439 --> 14:52.941
It was back there tonight.

14:53.108 --> 14:54.317
But how could that be?

14:54.485 --> 14:57.346
It was put away in that trunk
with the other things.

14:57.446 --> 14:59.364
Yes.

16:20.029 --> 16:22.613
"Hatred is Evil."

16:24.241 --> 16:27.243
Those were Girot's words.

16:29.163 --> 16:30.204
Sir?

16:32.875 --> 16:34.500
Pierre.

16:34.668 --> 16:37.170
Somebody must have been up here.

16:37.337 --> 16:39.505
First, the picture, and then...

16:39.673 --> 16:41.424
then the writing on the pedestal.

16:41.592 --> 16:42.675
Writing?

16:42.843 --> 16:45.261
Yes, in the dust there.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.213
It was there!

16:54.313 --> 16:56.340
Perhaps it's just the light.
You only thought that...

16:56.440 --> 16:59.442
Pierre, I'm not in the habit
of seeing things that do not exist.

16:59.610 --> 17:01.428
Of course not, sir.

17:01.528 --> 17:03.613
Why is this happening?

17:04.615 --> 17:07.157
They've been dead so long.

17:08.618 --> 17:11.621
I thought the past was behind me.

17:37.773 --> 17:40.233
I put the cognac in the study, sir.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.068
Thank you.

17:51.495 --> 17:54.080
- Well?
- It's very strange.

17:54.248 --> 17:56.666
He looks so pale. Perhaps he's ill.

17:56.834 --> 17:59.252
I'll see if he'll have dinner.

18:10.389 --> 18:14.100
Sir, shall I tell Louise to serve dinner?

18:14.935 --> 18:21.065
Pierre, you had ample time to know
Mrs. Cordier well before she died.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.483
Why, yes, sir.

18:22.651 --> 18:25.653
You know that both she and the boy
meant a great deal to me.

18:25.821 --> 18:27.530
Of course, sir.

18:28.198 --> 18:32.869
Perhaps memories are suddenly
unlocked in a man's mind.

18:33.036 --> 18:36.789
And he has dreams, nightmares.

18:37.791 --> 18:38.859
I can only surmise

18:38.959 --> 18:43.421
that such memories of my wife
and my son have returned.

18:44.548 --> 18:49.177
Pierre, after I have gone
to sleep at night,

18:49.344 --> 18:51.679
have I ever left my bedroom?

18:52.264 --> 18:55.141
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

18:55.309 --> 18:59.338
But I mean sleepwalked,
wandered in my sleep

18:59.438 --> 19:02.607
because of a dream, a nightmare...

19:02.774 --> 19:06.402
I don't know, sir.
Our room is in the other wing.

19:08.238 --> 19:10.781
I must have.

19:10.949 --> 19:14.493
There has to be a logical explanation.

19:17.789 --> 19:19.832
Tell Louise that I'll have
my dinner shortly.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.792
Yes, sir.

19:24.087 --> 19:27.798
My wife and son
have been dead for 12 years.

19:27.966 --> 19:31.245
Why should these strange things
be happening,

19:31.345 --> 19:35.306
now, only since the death of Louis Girot?

19:43.523 --> 19:45.233
- Good morning, Martin.
- Good morning, sir.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.360
Would you bring me
the Costane brief, please?

19:47.527 --> 19:49.403
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

20:18.767 --> 20:21.477
- The Costane brief, sir.
- Thank you.

20:21.645 --> 20:24.590
Did you have any reason
for leaving this here?

20:24.690 --> 20:28.234
"Trial testimony of Louis Girot..."

20:29.403 --> 20:33.906
The prisoner who...
who died the other day?

20:34.074 --> 20:36.575
No, sir, I didn't take it out of the file.

20:36.743 --> 20:38.077
It was on my desk.

20:38.287 --> 20:39.912
The office was locked.

20:41.248 --> 20:44.250
Could you have put it there
before you left last night?

20:45.252 --> 20:47.253
Yes.

20:47.421 --> 20:49.547
Yes, that's possible.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.508
Perhaps I was so upset by what happened,

20:52.676 --> 20:55.511
I didn't remember.

20:55.679 --> 20:58.373
Yes, sir, it must have been
most unnerving.

20:58.473 --> 21:00.933
Yes, that will be all, Martin. Thank you.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.676
Martin, will you find
the superintendent of the building?

21:35.844 --> 21:39.055
I want you to ask him
if anyone of the cleaning people

21:39.222 --> 21:42.558
could have taken the Girot testimony
from the file.

21:42.726 --> 21:45.436
- Immediately, sir.
- Thank you.

22:26.520 --> 22:27.645
Is someone here?

22:44.079 --> 22:47.065
Magistrate Cordier.

22:47.165 --> 22:49.792
Since Louis Girot is dead,

22:49.960 --> 22:53.087
you have no further use for his papers.

22:53.880 --> 23:00.052
You deprived me of Girot's body,
his mind, his will.

23:00.220 --> 23:03.639
Now I will have yours.

23:06.935 --> 23:09.145
What's the matter with me?

23:10.021 --> 23:12.731
Can I be as sick as Girot?

23:28.039 --> 23:31.417
I was determined to take
my place on the bench that day,

23:31.585 --> 23:35.004
despite the fears I had for my sanity.

23:35.172 --> 23:38.090
But suddenly, I felt I couldn't go on.

23:38.258 --> 23:40.801
It was impossible for me to concentrate.

23:40.969 --> 23:44.680
I hadn't even heard
the arguments of the attorneys.

23:44.848 --> 23:49.435
I knew I would have to call a recess
and leave for the day.

24:04.618 --> 24:07.828
Very interesting, Magistrate.

24:09.039 --> 24:13.292
I've been waiting patiently
to see what you would write.

24:14.961 --> 24:18.990
You still think I exist only in your mind.

24:20.842 --> 24:25.638
Men's logic has always denied
my existence.

24:26.848 --> 24:28.583
Since we have only begun
to know each other,

24:28.683 --> 24:31.560
perhaps we should
come closer to the truth.

24:38.318 --> 24:41.237
Rise, Simon Cordier.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.203
Life and death are the only truths.

24:49.371 --> 24:52.081
Everything else is illusion.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.209
Yourself...

24:57.170 --> 25:01.882
Your love for a useless bird in a cage.

25:05.053 --> 25:08.665
Death is a truth, Magistrate.

25:08.765 --> 25:10.683
Prove it.

25:25.532 --> 25:28.033
Prove it now!

25:48.847 --> 25:53.100
Kiki, where are you?

25:53.268 --> 25:55.352
How did you get out?

26:11.745 --> 26:16.749
How does one explain
what one cannot see, Dr. Borman?

26:16.916 --> 26:21.837
I hear this voice as though
someone is in the room with me.

26:22.005 --> 26:24.923
But I am alone. No one else is there.

26:25.091 --> 26:28.802
And it was this voice
that urged you to kill your pet?

26:28.970 --> 26:31.706
Well, how else can I explain it?

26:31.806 --> 26:35.142
The photograph, the writing in the dust,

26:35.310 --> 26:37.936
the trial testimony on your desk,

26:38.104 --> 26:41.440
the overturned inkwell, and the voice...

26:41.650 --> 26:44.234
Do you feel they are all related?

26:44.402 --> 26:47.446
Somehow, yes, yes.

26:55.664 --> 26:57.915
It is you who relate them,

26:58.083 --> 27:00.668
for they are all
from your own imagination.

27:00.835 --> 27:06.173
Science does not accept gnomes,
ghosts, demons, images of evil.

27:07.425 --> 27:08.467
The things you've told me

27:08.677 --> 27:11.746
about the tragic death
of your wife and son,

27:11.846 --> 27:14.431
the abnormal loneliness you've
lived in for the past 12 years...

27:14.641 --> 27:16.725
No, thank you.

27:16.893 --> 27:21.730
A man can torture himself
just so long that it must end,

27:21.898 --> 27:24.191
or the mind will break under the strain.

27:24.359 --> 27:26.819
I'm not sure what you mean.

27:26.986 --> 27:29.180
- You want my help.
- Yes.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.948
Will you do as I say?

27:31.116 --> 27:33.659
Now, Doctor, if there's hope,
I'll do anything.

27:33.827 --> 27:36.271
A doctor always has hope.

27:36.371 --> 27:41.500
Hope of curing his patient,
hope that his bill will be paid.

27:41.710 --> 27:43.377
Of course there's hope.

27:43.545 --> 27:46.130
Then, I've come to the right man.

27:46.297 --> 27:50.259
I've never had reason before
to go to an alienist.

27:51.052 --> 27:54.304
However, I can't cure you.

27:54.472 --> 27:56.791
- You have to cure yourself.
- Oh?

27:56.891 --> 27:58.877
You have to change your life.

27:58.977 --> 28:00.227
Get out of yourself.

28:00.395 --> 28:03.355
Never submit to loneliness.

28:03.523 --> 28:05.149
You said you used to sculpt?

28:05.316 --> 28:09.137
In my younger days,
I was quite interested in art.

28:09.237 --> 28:12.656
Fine. Become interested again.

28:12.824 --> 28:15.310
Get away from this existence
you've been leading.

28:15.410 --> 28:17.745
Associate with people in the art world.

28:17.912 --> 28:21.290
Find something to sculpt
and start sculpting.

28:21.458 --> 28:22.875
Take a vacation from your work.

28:23.042 --> 28:26.086
Doctor, I have so many cases
at court, I...

28:26.254 --> 28:28.589
I can only give you the prescription.

28:28.757 --> 28:31.675
The medicine, you must take yourself.

28:33.261 --> 28:37.347
Well, thank you. Talking to you
has been most reassuring.

28:37.515 --> 28:39.183
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

28:39.350 --> 28:40.919
Then, I've served my purpose.

28:41.019 --> 28:42.978
Let me hear from you again in a few weeks.

28:43.146 --> 28:45.814
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Doctor.

29:19.682 --> 29:21.767
Red wine! Red wine!

29:21.935 --> 29:23.962
How emotional, sensual, huh?

29:24.062 --> 29:25.771
Nudes that like nudes!

29:25.939 --> 29:28.049
You know what's the matter with you?
You're a woman!

29:28.149 --> 29:29.608
And you know what's the matter with you?

29:29.818 --> 29:30.818
You're a pig!

29:30.985 --> 29:33.278
- I'm a pig? I'm a pig?
- You're a pig!

29:33.446 --> 29:35.897
Who taught you all you know about...?

29:56.636 --> 29:59.054
Why don't you buy me, sir?

30:00.598 --> 30:04.393
It will be an act of charity.
The artist could use the money.

30:04.561 --> 30:06.353
You're the model, aren't you?

30:06.521 --> 30:09.815
Would you believe that I know
nothing at all about ballet?

30:09.983 --> 30:13.944
No. Well, then, either you have
the natural grace of a dancer

30:14.112 --> 30:16.446
or the artist gave it to you.

30:16.614 --> 30:18.240
You are an artist?

30:18.408 --> 30:20.659
Well I... I like to sculpt.

30:20.869 --> 30:24.997
Oh, sculptors are always covered
with clay and stone dust and...

30:25.164 --> 30:26.790
and have no money.

30:27.417 --> 30:29.334
Perhaps amateurs are more fortunate.

30:29.502 --> 30:35.048
Oh? Then, perhaps, you have
enough money for me to pose for you.

30:37.385 --> 30:39.428
Do I not inspire you?

30:39.929 --> 30:42.055
Yes, I think so.

30:42.223 --> 30:44.308
Let me see.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.045
A Greek goddess perhaps.

30:47.145 --> 30:49.313
Oh, so serious.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.814
Of course.

30:50.982 --> 30:54.026
- Why not Heinrich Heine, then?
- Who?

30:54.193 --> 30:56.612
Heine. He once wrote a wonderful poem.

30:56.779 --> 30:58.655
It was called "Woman".

30:58.865 --> 31:01.992
Oh, I didn't think any man knew women.

31:02.160 --> 31:05.563
Each of the four stanzas
is about a different situation

31:05.663 --> 31:07.915
going from gaiety to tragedy,

31:08.082 --> 31:11.710
and yet, each of the stanzas
ends with the same words:

31:11.878 --> 31:13.879
"And she laughed."

31:16.507 --> 31:19.176
'Cause I think you would always laugh.

31:19.344 --> 31:21.996
And that is the way
you would like to sculpt me?

31:22.096 --> 31:24.556
As a girl who can laugh at life?

31:24.891 --> 31:26.725
Yes.

31:26.935 --> 31:28.977
Good. For your laughing woman,

31:29.145 --> 31:31.980
I shall charge you
10 francs an hour to pose.

31:32.148 --> 31:33.732
Agreed.

31:33.942 --> 31:36.068
You're not going to haggle over the price?

31:36.235 --> 31:38.403
No, it's very reasonable.

31:38.571 --> 31:40.530
Here's my address.

31:40.698 --> 31:42.699
I'll expect you this evening at 8:00

31:42.909 --> 31:45.994
so we can begin the preliminary sketches.

31:46.162 --> 31:50.248
My name is Odette Mallotte.
I shall be there.

31:51.250 --> 31:54.544
- Good-bye, Odette.
- Good-bye.

31:57.632 --> 31:59.800
Simon Cordier.

32:00.718 --> 32:02.761
Magistrate...

32:16.275 --> 32:17.484
Good afternoon.

32:17.652 --> 32:19.277
- Oh, Odette.
- Jeanne.

32:19.445 --> 32:20.737
How are you, Odette?

32:20.947 --> 32:23.516
I've seen bigger crowds than this.

32:23.616 --> 32:25.325
There are always more customers at night.

32:25.493 --> 32:28.328
Well, let's hope they show
more enthusiasm than these.

32:28.496 --> 32:31.289
It doesn't matter.
I have faith in Paul's work.

32:31.457 --> 32:34.042
After all, Odette,
it is Paul's first show.

32:34.210 --> 32:37.212
It takes time for an artist
to become popular.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.214
Of course, Jeanne.

32:39.382 --> 32:43.427
We all have Paul's interests
at heart, don't we?

32:45.972 --> 32:48.348
He's in the office having coffee.

33:04.824 --> 33:06.601
Oh, hello, darling.

33:06.701 --> 33:09.494
I thought there would be more
customers by the time you got here.

33:09.662 --> 33:12.831
Six rich ones are better
than twenty poor ones.

33:13.041 --> 33:15.375
- Anybody buy?
- Yeah, the small seascape.

33:15.543 --> 33:17.419
The one where I posed on the rock?

33:17.587 --> 33:19.421
30 francs.

33:19.589 --> 33:21.548
30 francs?

33:21.716 --> 33:23.050
Oh, Paul.

33:23.217 --> 33:25.469
Paint, canvas, a frame?

33:25.636 --> 33:28.081
Your time and my time for 30 francs?

33:28.181 --> 33:29.973
Well, the larger ones will bring more.

33:30.141 --> 33:33.769
Oh, what is Andre doing,
trying to sell them by the yard?

33:34.645 --> 33:36.563
Well, at least
I'm going to make some money.

33:36.731 --> 33:40.150
- You?
- I have a job, posing.

33:41.110 --> 33:44.154
When you married me, you said
you'd give up posing for anyone else.

33:44.322 --> 33:46.865
I didn't say I'd give up eating.

33:48.659 --> 33:53.622
Well, at least we starve together.

33:53.790 --> 33:56.416
Odette, you know how much I love you.

33:56.584 --> 33:58.627
Oh, love!

33:58.795 --> 34:02.172
Love! A man says the word so easily!

34:02.340 --> 34:04.007
Do I have to wait until you're an old man

34:04.175 --> 34:08.303
before I can get a new dress,
until I can feel like a woman again?

34:08.471 --> 34:11.598
Have I ever failed
to make you feel like a woman?

34:13.601 --> 34:15.893
10 francs an hour.

34:16.103 --> 34:17.603
We need the money, Paul.

34:17.772 --> 34:20.565
Who is this artist
who can afford so much money?

34:22.735 --> 34:24.512
You're jealous? Yeah, my husband?

34:24.612 --> 34:25.612
Yes.

34:25.780 --> 34:28.239
You worry too much.

34:28.407 --> 34:31.868
What man could know me better than you?

34:32.078 --> 34:33.578
There, for luck.

34:33.746 --> 34:35.330
Sell a lot of paintings,

34:35.498 --> 34:40.210
and we'll share a bottle of wine
when I return, all right?

35:04.360 --> 35:05.777
- Mrs. Mallotte?
- Yes.

35:05.945 --> 35:07.487
Come in, please.

35:12.118 --> 35:16.079
I'll tell Magistrate Cordier
that you are here. Please.

35:32.221 --> 35:35.098
8:00 exactly. You are most prompt.

35:35.266 --> 35:37.601
Oh, well, the time of a magistrate
is important.

35:37.810 --> 35:39.227
And is your time not important?

35:39.395 --> 35:42.564
Oh, the more I look at clocks,
the more they keep saying,

35:42.732 --> 35:46.651
"Here it is tomorrow already,
and you're a day older."

35:46.819 --> 35:50.572
Only at my age is each day so valuable.

35:50.740 --> 35:52.324
Where do you work?

35:52.491 --> 35:55.619
The studio is upstairs. Come.

36:09.675 --> 36:12.302
When he brought home the clay
and said to clean up the attic,

36:12.470 --> 36:14.288
I knew everything
was going to be all right.

36:14.388 --> 36:17.140
- She's beautiful.
- Yes.

36:17.308 --> 36:18.376
It's been a long time

36:18.476 --> 36:21.519
since we've seen a woman
go up those stairs.

36:33.449 --> 36:35.867
Oh, how nice!

36:36.035 --> 36:40.455
It'll be a pleasure to pose for once
in a studio that isn't drafty.

36:40.623 --> 36:42.942
Most artists can't even afford heat.

36:43.042 --> 36:46.711
Well, the house is quite old
but very well built.

36:46.879 --> 36:50.006
I think my ancestors
demanded their comfort.

36:50.174 --> 36:52.759
Are those were the ones who frowned
at me in the hall downstairs?

36:52.927 --> 36:54.636
The portraits?

36:54.804 --> 36:58.765
I assure you, they frown at everyone.

36:58.933 --> 37:02.503
Is your laughing lady to laugh with
or without her clothes on?

37:02.603 --> 37:04.020
No, it won't be a nude.

37:06.315 --> 37:07.857
Oh, that's right.

37:08.025 --> 37:12.654
There should be nothing to detract
from the expression on her face.

37:13.948 --> 37:16.574
You know quite a good deal
about art, don't you?

37:17.576 --> 37:20.787
One listens, one learns.

37:20.955 --> 37:21.997
Where shall I pose?

37:22.164 --> 37:25.417
Oh, I'm sorry, right here.
The light is best here.

37:25.584 --> 37:27.043
All right.

37:33.467 --> 37:35.343
Let's see.

37:36.262 --> 37:39.889
You want the head, throat,
and bare shoulders.

37:40.057 --> 37:41.891
Yes.

37:51.277 --> 37:54.237
I'm afraid I've forgotten
how to compliment a beautiful woman.

37:55.364 --> 37:58.533
I hope perhaps the clay
will be able to do it for me.

38:05.291 --> 38:07.375
There. Down a little.

38:13.132 --> 38:16.926
Now, the expression, Odette.
The expression. Gaiety.

38:17.094 --> 38:18.511
Think of something to laugh about.

38:18.679 --> 38:22.974
Oh, that's simple.
Life is full of things to laugh at.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.730
There!

38:28.898 --> 38:32.400
There, that's it. That's the expression.

38:32.568 --> 38:35.070
Now, keep it just like that.

38:40.659 --> 38:45.064
The sketches are finished, and I have
begun the actual working of the clay.

38:45.164 --> 38:47.874
My eagerness to capture
Odette's laughing quality,

38:48.042 --> 38:50.710
which is gay yet strangely enigmatic,

38:50.878 --> 38:54.172
has found me sculpting
for long hours without realizing it.

38:54.340 --> 38:58.134
But the girl has held the difficult
pose without complaining.

38:58.344 --> 39:02.347
It is indeed flattering that she shares
my dedication to the work.

39:02.515 --> 39:07.435
The nightmares have not returned,
and I feel so much better now.

39:07.603 --> 39:10.522
It is as if all the dark corners
of my mind

39:10.689 --> 39:13.608
have been filled with bright sunlight.

39:13.776 --> 39:17.153
There! We've done it.

39:17.363 --> 39:19.890
We've brought highness point to life.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.741
You are the laughing woman.

39:21.909 --> 39:26.413
Why not? Heine was writing
about me all the time.

39:27.957 --> 39:32.419
It's good! It's really good!

39:32.586 --> 39:34.504
I am now immortal.

39:34.672 --> 39:36.506
You have created me.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.426
You are my master, and I thank you.

39:39.593 --> 39:42.496
You really like it? I hoped you would.

39:42.596 --> 39:43.763
But what happens to me now?

39:43.931 --> 39:47.058
Do I stay up here like all the rest
of your statues to gather dust?

39:47.226 --> 39:49.686
No, that wouldn't give her much
to laugh about, would it?

39:49.854 --> 39:52.564
Perhaps you should do something new

39:52.731 --> 39:54.858
to keep her company.

39:55.025 --> 39:56.484
Oh, what would you like?

39:56.652 --> 39:58.778
Oh, I don't know.

39:59.238 --> 40:02.574
Oh, of course. A life-size figure of me.

40:02.741 --> 40:06.161
Then, she could look at herself,
and you would know why she's laughing.

40:06.328 --> 40:09.831
You don't take yourself
seriously at all, do you?

40:09.999 --> 40:11.791
Now you've returned
to being the magistrate

40:11.959 --> 40:14.252
who wants to know about people.

40:14.420 --> 40:16.963
Why should you want to know about me?

40:17.131 --> 40:21.009
I've posed, the work is finished.

40:22.261 --> 40:23.511
I will leave.

40:25.514 --> 40:29.517
Sometime I might just do
that life-sized figure of you.

40:29.685 --> 40:33.521
Tonight you think that. Tomorrow...

40:34.482 --> 40:36.191
You know what I am?

40:37.067 --> 40:38.693
Perfume.

40:39.278 --> 40:41.488
Your 10 francs an hour bought it.

40:41.655 --> 40:45.200
And that is all you will remember of me.

40:46.076 --> 40:49.037
The scent of a perfume
that was once in this room.

40:49.205 --> 40:51.331
No, really, Odette, I...

40:52.291 --> 40:56.503
Sensitive enough to be an artist.

40:57.213 --> 41:03.885
Strong enough to be a man
who can judge others.

41:05.012 --> 41:08.431
You're an unusual man, Simon.

41:09.683 --> 41:12.310
That is what I will remember of you.

41:12.520 --> 41:16.648
Thank you, Odette. You're very kind.

41:19.485 --> 41:21.945
When you told me your wife
had died many years ago,

41:22.112 --> 41:26.533
I thought, "How fine she looks.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.661
She must have meant a great deal to him."

41:31.038 --> 41:33.498
And yet, you keep her locked away up here.

41:33.666 --> 41:35.708
I've wondered why.

41:35.876 --> 41:38.586
It was the way she died.

41:40.047 --> 41:43.132
She wasn't buried from the church.

41:44.343 --> 41:47.136
But surely she must have been
a good woman.

41:47.304 --> 41:51.182
She took her own life.

41:52.017 --> 41:54.519
And you never forgave her.

41:54.687 --> 41:56.521
I...

41:58.148 --> 42:00.400
It was in the past.

42:01.151 --> 42:05.014
Perhaps she didn't know
how to laugh at herself.

42:05.114 --> 42:11.869
Odette, I'm grateful to you
in more ways than you know.

42:13.831 --> 42:18.376
I think I will miss this attic.

42:18.586 --> 42:22.755
If I have another idea
for a new work, I'll call on you.

42:22.923 --> 42:25.091
Now, the coach is waiting.

42:29.179 --> 42:32.265
- Good-bye, Simon.
- Good-bye, Odette.

43:19.938 --> 43:21.731
What is it, Magistrate?

43:21.899 --> 43:23.983
Are you wondering how so important a man

43:24.151 --> 43:27.320
can fail to see himself in a mirror?

43:28.947 --> 43:31.866
Now, come, Simon Cordier,
you should know by now

43:32.034 --> 43:36.079
that I am real, that I am not a dream.

43:37.790 --> 43:41.084
Common sense should tell you
that the reason you can't see yourself

43:41.251 --> 43:45.004
is that someone stands
between you and the mirror.

43:45.172 --> 43:46.172
What?

43:46.340 --> 43:49.050
I am that someone.

43:49.218 --> 43:52.470
That should assure you
that my physical being is quite solid,

43:52.680 --> 43:55.098
even if your eyes can't see me.

43:57.726 --> 43:59.686
That's not possible.

44:00.229 --> 44:02.980
I do not believe it.

44:11.281 --> 44:13.157
You are there!

44:13.659 --> 44:16.353
Then, why can't I see you?

44:16.453 --> 44:18.621
Calm yourself, Magistrate.

44:18.789 --> 44:22.458
I will give you back your reflection.

44:24.795 --> 44:29.006
You see, as good as new.

44:29.717 --> 44:32.009
Tell me what's happening.

44:32.761 --> 44:34.788
Are you human?

44:34.888 --> 44:37.473
That depends on the point of view.

44:37.683 --> 44:42.186
If you mean, do the Horla live
on the earth as you do?

44:42.354 --> 44:45.940
Yes, you are not the sole inhabitants.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.818
The Horla?

44:48.986 --> 44:50.778
But if you are here...

44:50.946 --> 44:55.491
We have always been
We just exist on different planes.

44:55.701 --> 45:00.496
We can move into your plane
only when you make it possible.

45:04.042 --> 45:06.711
I don't understand.

45:06.879 --> 45:09.672
How could I have made it possible?

45:09.840 --> 45:12.508
Through evil, Magistrate.

45:12.718 --> 45:15.746
But I have fought evil all my life.

45:15.846 --> 45:18.097
The great Magistrate,

45:18.265 --> 45:22.560
the dispenser of justice for one and all.

45:22.770 --> 45:25.021
You're a murderer, Simon Cordier.

45:25.189 --> 45:28.608
I have never murdered anyone!

45:45.167 --> 45:47.835
This was your victim, Magistrate.

45:48.003 --> 45:50.421
You drove her to suicide.

45:50.589 --> 45:53.800
You tortured her mind
until she took her own life.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.010
No.

45:56.178 --> 45:59.305
She was innocent,
yet you judged her guilty.

45:59.473 --> 46:02.475
You blamed her for the death of your son.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.819
Forgive me.

46:12.986 --> 46:18.350
Now I am here, and I will never leave you.

46:18.450 --> 46:20.451
Why? What do you want?

46:20.619 --> 46:22.578
Your will, Magistrate.

46:22.788 --> 46:26.040
Your evil has delivered you to me.

46:27.042 --> 46:30.086
I've paid for my sins.

46:30.254 --> 46:34.306
You thought your loneliness
was repentance for your wife's death.

46:35.592 --> 46:38.928
All it did was make you vulnerable.

46:39.096 --> 46:44.225
Look, Magistrate. Look at the clay
you finished sculpting tonight.

46:47.688 --> 46:52.358
You wanted to believe that your model
was what she pretended to be.

47:06.832 --> 47:10.334
But this is what she really is.

47:10.502 --> 47:13.421
You see evil in everything!

47:13.589 --> 47:16.215
Only where it exists.

47:16.842 --> 47:20.887
No. No, she is as I saw her.

47:42.492 --> 47:46.162
Pierre! Pierre, come up here at once.

47:46.330 --> 47:48.956
- What is it?
- I don't know.

48:01.053 --> 48:03.012
Sir?

48:03.180 --> 48:05.640
Pierre.

48:05.807 --> 48:08.726
The clay. Tell me, what do you see?

48:08.936 --> 48:12.313
Why, it's changed, sir.

48:12.481 --> 48:16.067
Yes. Yes, I wanted you to see.

48:16.234 --> 48:18.736
But why, sir? Why is it changed?

48:18.946 --> 48:22.156
Thank you, Pierre. That will be all.

48:22.324 --> 48:24.575
Leave me alone now, please.

48:49.226 --> 48:52.395
All my life I had sought knowledge,

48:52.562 --> 48:56.774
and now I was granted knowledge
rarely granted other men.

48:56.984 --> 49:01.388
No more hideous fact could have
been conceived to terrify my mind.

49:01.488 --> 49:04.516
The Horla really live.

49:04.616 --> 49:05.950
They cannot be seen.

49:06.118 --> 49:09.954
Still, they are tangible,
composed of solid matter.

49:10.122 --> 49:11.539
And only the Lord knows

49:11.707 --> 49:15.167
if they are flesh and blood as we are.

49:15.961 --> 49:18.045
Why are they here?

49:18.213 --> 49:22.550
Why has their evil
been turned loose upon the earth?

49:29.141 --> 49:33.477
You tremble, Magistrate? Why?

49:34.604 --> 49:38.733
Perhaps I will be
a gentle and kind master.

49:38.900 --> 49:40.818
Get out! Leave me alone!

49:41.028 --> 49:42.778
But I want to help you.

49:43.572 --> 49:47.450
There. No reason we shouldn't
be comfortable, is there?

49:47.617 --> 49:50.604
You do not believe
that the woman who posed for you

49:50.704 --> 49:52.955
is without a heart,

49:53.123 --> 49:58.377
that your riches, your position,
are the goal of her evil ambition.

49:58.545 --> 50:03.049
It makes no difference.
I'll never see her again.

50:03.216 --> 50:06.552
Don't you want to prove that I'm wrong?

50:06.720 --> 50:09.122
The woman means nothing to me.

50:09.222 --> 50:11.140
She will.

50:13.310 --> 50:15.212
What are you saying?

50:15.312 --> 50:18.189
You will pursue her, Magistrate.

50:18.356 --> 50:22.818
You will seek to create love
where there is no love.

50:23.028 --> 50:27.490
No, I will not. I tell you, I will not!

50:29.701 --> 50:33.120
Your will obeys me from this moment on.

50:33.288 --> 50:35.581
You have no choice.

50:38.043 --> 50:41.712
She is a vain woman, Magistrate.

50:41.880 --> 50:46.175
The painting of her,
the one that brought you together,

50:46.343 --> 50:50.304
it would appeal to that vanity.

50:56.770 --> 50:58.854
I thought I'd never live to see it,

50:59.064 --> 51:02.024
the face of another woman
where Mrs. Cordier's had been.

51:02.192 --> 51:05.194
There are so many strange things
happening in this house.

51:09.783 --> 51:11.700
They're coming.

51:14.079 --> 51:16.163
And you won't tell me
what the surprise is?

51:16.331 --> 51:18.082
Well, why spoil it?

51:18.250 --> 51:20.918
Seeing you this soon again
was enough of a surprise.

51:21.086 --> 51:23.379
Did you really think
I'd let you get away so easily?

51:23.547 --> 51:26.757
I thought you were only interested
in clay women.

51:32.097 --> 51:34.473
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, Pierre.

51:34.641 --> 51:39.186
Tell Louise that we'll want
her finest dinner, and champagne.

51:39.354 --> 51:41.564
- '81 was a good year.
- Yes, sir.

51:41.731 --> 51:45.401
Champagne? You're filled with surprises.

51:46.027 --> 51:50.698
Well, I want this to be
a most memorable day.

51:50.866 --> 51:54.743
The suspense is positively unbearable.

51:58.957 --> 52:00.791
My painting!

52:04.963 --> 52:10.134
Oh, Simon, why? Why did you buy it?

52:10.302 --> 52:13.721
Well, it was such
an ugly empty space there.

52:13.889 --> 52:15.556
Well, I think it's quite decorative,
don't you?

52:15.724 --> 52:19.351
Well, is that the only reason
you brought me here, to get my opinion?

52:19.519 --> 52:23.772
Well, can you think of a more charming
audience for such a charming painting?

52:23.940 --> 52:25.608
I'm overwhelmed.

52:25.775 --> 52:28.235
Well, then, perhaps
this memorable day will...

52:28.403 --> 52:31.906
will lead to many such days.

52:32.073 --> 52:34.617
I'm not sure what you mean.

52:34.784 --> 52:36.827
Well, it's really quite simple.

52:36.995 --> 52:38.746
You see, after you left here last night,

52:38.914 --> 52:44.585
I suddenly realized
that both the house and my heart

52:44.753 --> 52:46.837
were quite empty.

52:47.464 --> 52:51.634
Oh, and yesterday I thought
I'd never see you again.

52:52.469 --> 52:54.470
Oh, Simon, you...

52:54.638 --> 52:58.291
you gave me no indication
that you felt this way.

52:58.391 --> 53:00.726
And I realize that I'm much older
than you are.

53:00.894 --> 53:05.314
Oh, no, please, I'm flattered.

53:06.191 --> 53:07.509
Can't you understand?

53:07.609 --> 53:12.363
All those weeks we were together,
I was the one who cared.

53:12.530 --> 53:15.616
Very well, then, defendant,
how to you plead?

53:15.784 --> 53:18.202
I don't know whether
I'm innocent of guilty feelings

53:18.370 --> 53:22.248
or guilty of innocent feelings.

53:22.999 --> 53:26.543
Are you wondering
if I am proposing marriage?

53:27.545 --> 53:30.714
- Marriage?
- Would you accept less?

53:31.341 --> 53:33.717
Oh, Simon, I...

53:35.011 --> 53:36.845
I only know I love you.

53:37.013 --> 53:39.181
Then, I will pronounce the sentence.

53:39.349 --> 53:42.017
Turn around, turn around.

53:54.656 --> 53:56.407
Oh, Simon.

53:56.574 --> 53:59.201
Oh, Simon, it's lovely.

54:01.997 --> 54:04.248
Thank you, Simon.

54:05.166 --> 54:09.670
Would it answer your question
if I told you that that cameo

54:09.838 --> 54:11.839
once belonged to my wife?

54:13.633 --> 54:16.051
Oh, Simon.

54:22.350 --> 54:26.395
When she came home last night,
she was a stranger to me,

54:26.563 --> 54:28.605
as though I had never known her.

54:28.773 --> 54:30.232
Nothing I said made any difference.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.693
She just laughed when I told her

54:32.861 --> 54:36.947
that the ballet painting
had been sold for 100 francs.

54:37.115 --> 54:39.241
You mean she's already taken
the new apartment?

54:39.409 --> 54:41.702
Yeah, moved into it this morning.

54:41.870 --> 54:46.290
Oh, Paul, I'm terribly sorry.

54:46.458 --> 54:50.586
Am I supposed to accept it?
What do I do, Jeanne?

54:50.754 --> 54:53.547
She always wanted so much.

54:54.382 --> 54:56.258
Why couldn't she have waited
for your success?

54:56.426 --> 54:58.344
As you would?

54:59.596 --> 55:03.974
She's my wife, not a friend.
There's a difference.

55:05.477 --> 55:07.436
Yes, there's a difference.

55:10.065 --> 55:13.567
I found this in her dresser drawer
after she'd moved.

55:22.744 --> 55:23.937
A magistrate?

55:24.037 --> 55:28.374
Yes, a rich man, a man of position.

55:28.541 --> 55:31.585
Who else do we know
could afford 10 francs an hour?

55:31.753 --> 55:34.129
But how can you be sure?

55:34.297 --> 55:36.548
When she left,
she said she was going to have

55:36.716 --> 55:39.676
all the things I could never give her.

55:39.844 --> 55:43.722
I didn't know what she meant then.
I do now.

55:43.890 --> 55:46.459
Paul, she's still married to you.

55:46.559 --> 55:48.018
Yes.

55:48.186 --> 55:52.398
And as long as she is,
that's the one thing he can't give her.

56:02.033 --> 56:06.954
To my future wife,
who taught me how to laugh again.

56:10.875 --> 56:13.210
Simon.

56:13.378 --> 56:16.296
Simon, would it matter very much to you

56:16.464 --> 56:20.134
if we didn't announce the wedding
just yet?

56:20.301 --> 56:22.010
Wait? But why?

56:22.178 --> 56:25.498
Well, there's something
I must take care of first.

56:25.598 --> 56:27.500
But surely there's nothing
so important that...

56:27.600 --> 56:29.476
Oh, Simon, trust me, please.

56:29.644 --> 56:30.644
Of course, my dear.

56:30.812 --> 56:34.674
But I wanted to open our place
on the lake at Lucerne.

56:34.774 --> 56:36.859
The weather is still fine,
and our honeymoon could be...

56:37.026 --> 56:42.406
Oh, darling, I promise you, nothing will
stop us from having that honeymoon.

56:43.283 --> 56:45.576
Pardon, sir, there's someone to see you.

56:45.743 --> 56:48.578
- At this hour?
- Mr. Duclasse.

56:48.746 --> 56:50.581
Duclasse, the artist?

56:50.748 --> 56:52.150
Yes.

56:52.250 --> 56:54.209
Well, have him wait.

56:58.089 --> 56:59.923
What is it, Odette?

57:00.091 --> 57:04.454
I wanted to have it settled
before I told you.

57:04.554 --> 57:07.389
Well, does Duclasse mean anything to you?

57:09.726 --> 57:11.810
He is my husband.

57:11.978 --> 57:14.313
Oh, Simon, we're separated.

57:14.522 --> 57:17.524
I've told him I'll never go back to him.

57:19.110 --> 57:23.155
Simon, I don't want to go
through another scene with him.

57:25.033 --> 57:26.909
I understand.

57:43.593 --> 57:47.471
Good evening, Mr. Duclasse.
This way, please.

57:53.102 --> 57:55.562
You were the one who bought the painting.

57:56.523 --> 57:59.107
Oh, be assured,
I am an admirer of your work.

57:59.275 --> 58:00.484
And of my wife.

58:00.652 --> 58:02.236
Well, then, we have much in common.

58:02.403 --> 58:04.154
Won't you sit down?

58:05.532 --> 58:08.909
You do admit
you are the reason Odette left me.

58:09.077 --> 58:12.204
I do not.
I only know that she had left you.

58:12.914 --> 58:15.290
I want you to leave her alone.

58:15.500 --> 58:17.334
But, Mr. Duclasse, Odette is no child.

58:17.544 --> 58:18.544
She has made a choice.

58:18.711 --> 58:20.087
Choice? And what did she choose?

58:20.255 --> 58:21.922
This big house, your money.

58:22.090 --> 58:24.174
I sympathize with you.

58:24.342 --> 58:27.495
But I prefer to believe
that she has found it possible

58:27.595 --> 58:29.721
to think of me as a man she wants.

58:29.889 --> 58:32.349
And if I refuse to give you the divorce?

58:32.559 --> 58:35.561
Do you really think
it would make any difference?

58:35.728 --> 58:40.315
She has already intimated to me
that she prefers me on any terms.

58:40.525 --> 58:41.692
I could kill you for that.

58:41.859 --> 58:45.153
You are in my house,
and I am trying to be as kind as possible

58:45.321 --> 58:46.572
under the circumstances.

58:46.739 --> 58:48.574
I don't need your kindness, Magistrate.

58:48.741 --> 58:50.701
Well, what else have I to offer you?

58:51.786 --> 58:54.705
I love Odette, and I will not give her up.

58:54.872 --> 58:59.418
And what of your fine reputation
if this were made public?

59:00.962 --> 59:02.754
Are you threatening me?

59:02.922 --> 59:04.673
Yes.

59:04.841 --> 59:07.301
Think about it, Magistrate.

59:09.804 --> 59:12.681
He will be trouble, Simon. Kill him!

59:14.434 --> 59:17.811
Kill him? No!

59:17.979 --> 59:20.855
No, you cannot make me commit murder!

59:34.746 --> 59:36.830
What happened?

59:36.998 --> 59:39.291
It almost fell on me.

59:45.548 --> 59:49.426
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

59:50.136 --> 59:54.389
It would have been a most
convenient accident, wouldn't it?

59:54.599 --> 59:56.767
Mr. Duclasse, I...

59:57.894 --> 01:00:00.145
Those urns have been up there
since the house was built.

01:00:00.313 --> 01:00:02.064
How could it have fallen?

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.441
It's all right, Pierre.

01:00:04.651 --> 01:00:07.861
You may clean this up in the morning.

01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:09.571
Yes, sir.

01:00:13.951 --> 01:00:17.245
- I'm frightened, Pierre.
- Shh.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.466
You tried to kill him.

01:00:29.634 --> 01:00:33.595
No, we are not ready for his death yet.

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:37.432
That was merely to show you
how simple killing can be.

01:00:37.642 --> 01:00:41.269
As simple as crushing the life
from a bird.

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:45.107
But you cannot make me take a human life.

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:49.486
Not as long as there is
a shred of my will left.

01:00:51.823 --> 01:00:53.615
You've already started to murder him

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:56.827
by taking the one thing he loved.

01:00:56.994 --> 01:01:02.708
The time will come, Magistrate,
and you will end his agony.

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:05.168
No!

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:29.943
Has Paul gone?

01:01:30.111 --> 01:01:33.488
Yes. Odette, we can't stay here.

01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:34.865
I want to leave Paris.

01:01:35.032 --> 01:01:37.075
Tell me that you'll come
to Lucerne with me now.

01:01:37.243 --> 01:01:38.311
But what of Paul?

01:01:38.411 --> 01:01:41.538
Well, I have some influence.
Perhaps I can arrange an annulment.

01:01:41.748 --> 01:01:43.540
We'll be married in Switzerland.

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.001
But I want to leave this house
as soon as possible tomorrow.

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.002
Can you be ready?

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:49.379
Oh, Simon, what is it?
Is Paul causing trouble?

01:01:49.547 --> 01:01:51.715
Please, tell me, will you go?

01:01:51.883 --> 01:01:54.718
Of course, Simon. I'll be ready.

01:01:54.886 --> 01:01:57.679
The servants will leave immediately.
There's a train at midnight.

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:00.140
They'll have the villa ready for us
by the time we get there.

01:02:00.308 --> 01:02:03.351
We'll leave on the morning train.
I'll pick you up at 10:00.

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:07.272
We'll be happy, Simon. I know we will.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.358
We must take whatever happiness
we can, Odette.

01:02:11.444 --> 01:02:13.195
That's all we can do.

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:14.946
Come.

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:46.770
You're here, aren't you?

01:02:46.938 --> 01:02:49.147
You've been here all the time.

01:02:49.816 --> 01:02:53.276
You must admit that patience is a virtue.

01:02:54.028 --> 01:02:56.404
Are you running from me, Magistrate?

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.406
Yes!

01:03:01.994 --> 01:03:05.163
The human body is so fragile.

01:03:05.331 --> 01:03:10.418
It withers and dies so easily,
as a flower does.

01:03:13.798 --> 01:03:17.133
Do you think that by putting distance
between yourself and Paul Duclasse,

01:03:17.301 --> 01:03:20.136
that I can't make you kill him?

01:03:22.974 --> 01:03:26.476
You say the Horla exist as people do?

01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:30.564
Very well, then, your powers
must be limited as ours are.

01:03:31.816 --> 01:03:33.608
Do you think that I'll let you run

01:03:33.818 --> 01:03:36.820
so that you can share your life
with that woman?

01:03:36.988 --> 01:03:39.614
I will not be stopped.

01:03:39.824 --> 01:03:41.825
You'll share nothing!

01:03:41.993 --> 01:03:46.371
As this rose is destroyed,
so can I destroy your resistance.

01:03:46.539 --> 01:03:49.499
Every thought you think,
your senses, your will,

01:03:49.667 --> 01:03:52.210
they belong to me to use as I wish.

01:03:58.217 --> 01:04:02.095
No more bullets left, Magistrate.

01:04:04.849 --> 01:04:08.226
The woman is useless to us,

01:04:08.394 --> 01:04:12.355
as useless as any dead thing.

01:04:13.399 --> 01:04:15.525
What are you saying?

01:04:15.693 --> 01:04:19.613
A dead thing owns nothing,

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:24.034
possesses no one, Magistrate.

01:04:24.201 --> 01:04:27.829
That is what she must be.

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:30.123
I can't.

01:04:30.291 --> 01:04:32.250
I can't.

01:04:32.418 --> 01:04:36.463
A dead thing, Magistrate.

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:00.695
Who is it?

01:05:00.905 --> 01:05:03.432
Odette, I must talk to you.

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.700
Paul, go away. Leave me alone.

01:05:07.995 --> 01:05:11.039
You're my wife! You owe me this much!

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:15.335
All right, all right! Stop it!
You'll break down the door.

01:05:18.798 --> 01:05:20.423
Odette, I...

01:05:22.134 --> 01:05:23.593
Where are you going?

01:05:23.761 --> 01:05:26.763
- None of your business.
- You...

01:05:26.973 --> 01:05:28.807
You're going with him?

01:05:30.142 --> 01:05:31.476
My things!

01:05:31.644 --> 01:05:35.256
My things! Get out!
You're not gonna spoil it for me!

01:05:35.356 --> 01:05:37.107
Odette, I can't let you do this
to either of us.

01:05:37.274 --> 01:05:38.400
I'd rather see you dead.

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:41.027
Doesn't it matter what I want?

01:05:43.114 --> 01:05:44.489
Maybe I should feel sorry for him.

01:05:44.657 --> 01:05:47.409
You'll bleed him dry,
take every cent he's got,

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:50.412
and meanwhile be looking for another man
with even more money.

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:54.249
Yes. Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.042
Are you satisfied?

01:05:56.210 --> 01:06:01.214
Yes, I'm satisfied that I'm a fool
and that he's a bigger one.

01:06:25.406 --> 01:06:28.199
Why, Simon, I didn't expect...

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.218
No!

01:08:01.669 --> 01:08:03.503
- Good morning, Magistrate.
- Good morning, Master.

01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:04.754
I expected Pierre.

01:08:04.922 --> 01:08:08.049
Pierre and Louise have left
for my place in Switzerland.

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:11.344
Please forward my mail there
until I notify you.

01:08:11.512 --> 01:08:14.055
- I'll be very glad to, sir.
- Thank you.

01:08:28.444 --> 01:08:30.404
Blood?

01:08:48.174 --> 01:08:50.133
Odette?

01:09:14.992 --> 01:09:16.868
No!

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.441
You murdered her!

01:09:48.609 --> 01:09:50.636
You're quite wrong, Magistrate.

01:09:50.736 --> 01:09:52.028
You killed her.

01:09:52.238 --> 01:09:54.447
It was your hand.

01:09:54.615 --> 01:09:55.740
No!

01:09:55.908 --> 01:09:59.702
Can you deny the evidence
you've hidden in the clay?

01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:05.174
I couldn't have done it.
I never left the house!

01:10:06.252 --> 01:10:07.794
That's right, Magistrate.

01:10:07.962 --> 01:10:11.631
I'm the only one who knows
you left here last night.

01:10:11.799 --> 01:10:14.842
You're quite safe, I assure you.

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:19.055
I didn't do it. I didn't kill her.

01:10:19.265 --> 01:10:23.643
The murderer Girot
never thought he killed either.

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:29.899
Had you learned to love her, Magistrate?

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:54.882
- Father.
- What is it?

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:57.719
The police, they've arrested Paul.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:11:00.888
Paul? For killing Odette?

01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:03.808
But why? I don't understand.

01:11:03.976 --> 01:11:06.545
The landlady identified him.

01:11:06.645 --> 01:11:11.024
She heard him arguing with Odette.
There was a struggle.

01:11:11.859 --> 01:11:14.819
Paul wouldn't have done it. He loved her.

01:11:14.987 --> 01:11:16.805
The police will learn the truth, Jeanne.

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:19.407
We know that Paul is innocent.
They will find it out.

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.909
He doesn't even have money
for a good lawyer.

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:25.663
Whatever we have will be his
if he needs it.

01:11:31.211 --> 01:11:37.008
Helen, if only it was
in my power to bring you back.

01:11:37.801 --> 01:11:40.636
So that I could tell you
how meaningless my life became

01:11:40.804 --> 01:11:43.514
when you were no longer with me.

01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:47.894
Tragedy can blind the judgment of a man.

01:11:49.146 --> 01:11:51.397
I know you would understand that.

01:11:56.653 --> 01:12:00.948
What is it, Magistrate?
Are you talking to memories now?

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:03.368
Do you think she can hear you?

01:12:03.535 --> 01:12:07.205
My heart has spoken to her many times.

01:12:07.373 --> 01:12:09.540
Yes, she can hear me!

01:12:11.835 --> 01:12:15.630
Fool. Do you expect me
to have patience with sentiment?

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:18.075
You had no reason to do that!

01:12:18.175 --> 01:12:20.786
You were only talking
to your conscience, Magistrate.

01:12:20.886 --> 01:12:23.388
You're still a murderer.

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:29.086
And if I am, then I will not let
an innocent man die

01:12:29.186 --> 01:12:30.963
for something I did.

01:12:31.063 --> 01:12:32.589
On the contrary.

01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:36.093
Paul Duclasse will go to the guillotine.

01:12:36.193 --> 01:12:38.444
Haven't you done enough?

01:12:39.363 --> 01:12:41.197
Why should I let them
execute you, Magistrate,

01:12:41.365 --> 01:12:43.892
when you serve my purpose so well?

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:46.369
Cover your victim with this.

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.358
I...

01:12:51.458 --> 01:12:54.695
I can't, I can't!

01:12:54.795 --> 01:12:58.297
You think I'm so stupid
as to let the police find it?

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:03.454
The grave is waiting.

01:13:03.554 --> 01:13:07.515
Do as I say.

01:13:25.409 --> 01:13:28.828
To the back of the garden, Magistrate.

01:13:35.586 --> 01:13:38.572
You see, I can be most accommodating.

01:13:38.672 --> 01:13:41.841
The grave is already dug.

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.914
You used clay to make her like this.

01:13:47.014 --> 01:13:49.599
She returns to clay.

01:14:03.697 --> 01:14:06.266
When the grave is filled,

01:14:06.366 --> 01:14:10.077
we will remove the last vestige
of the woman from your life.

01:14:21.173 --> 01:14:26.787
The painting, Magistrate.
It, too, must be destroyed.

01:14:26.887 --> 01:14:30.515
Leave me alone! Let me have peace!

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:36.771
I doubt whether such art
is meant for immortality.

01:14:41.652 --> 01:14:43.194
Burn it.

01:14:45.656 --> 01:14:48.725
No. No, I've done enough.

01:14:48.825 --> 01:14:51.228
There's the fire. You burn it.

01:14:51.328 --> 01:14:53.746
You heard what I said.

01:14:55.749 --> 01:14:59.001
Do as I say. Burn it!

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:28.656
The police, Magistrate.

01:15:34.538 --> 01:15:38.816
You will tell them
only what I want you to tell them.

01:16:02.649 --> 01:16:04.635
- Robert.
- Good evening, Simon.

01:16:04.735 --> 01:16:06.152
Come in, come in.

01:16:07.154 --> 01:16:10.865
It is not often that I am honored
by your presence.

01:16:11.283 --> 01:16:15.062
A policeman isn't supposed
to have time for his friends.

01:16:15.162 --> 01:16:17.814
If it isn't one thing, it's another.

01:16:17.914 --> 01:16:20.234
Now, this stupid murder.

01:16:20.334 --> 01:16:23.586
Oh, yes, yes. It's a terrible thing.

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:29.034
A glass of wine, Robert?

01:16:29.134 --> 01:16:30.911
No, I can only stay a minute.

01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:33.038
Oh, then, this isn't a social call.

01:16:33.138 --> 01:16:36.432
Yes and no. I have to ask a favor of you.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.127
Oh? Well, sit down.

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:43.131
This murderer Duclasse,
he wants to talk to you.

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:45.092
To me? But whatever for?

01:16:45.192 --> 01:16:48.194
Well, he seems to have the idea
that you'll help him.

01:16:48.945 --> 01:16:51.306
But I don't even know the man.

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:54.935
Many people know your reputation
as a man who works hard for justice.

01:16:55.035 --> 01:16:56.770
Oh, I see.

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:59.648
Frankly, Simon, I don't think
anybody can help him.

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:01.775
We have the testimony of his landlady

01:17:01.875 --> 01:17:04.987
and other people in the house
who recalled his wife.

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:08.631
End earlier this morning we found
the murder weapon hidden in his bedroom.

01:17:10.717 --> 01:17:14.512
The examining magistrate
already has the case.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.790
Yes, he says there's no doubt about it.

01:17:16.890 --> 01:17:19.642
Everything points to Duclasse
as the killer.

01:17:20.519 --> 01:17:22.921
Might be very interesting.

01:17:23.021 --> 01:17:25.940
Still studying the criminal mind.

01:17:26.983 --> 01:17:29.318
It's a fascinating subject, Robert.

01:17:29.986 --> 01:17:32.973
Bring Duclasse to my chambers.
I'll talk with him.

01:17:33.073 --> 01:17:36.184
I can see you've earned
your reputation honestly.

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.853
Tomorrow, noon.

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:40.746
- Good night, Simon.
- Good night.

01:17:52.092 --> 01:17:54.161
Oh, Captain.
Magistrate Cordier is waiting.

01:17:54.261 --> 01:17:56.512
Go right in, please.

01:17:59.182 --> 01:18:02.810
Magistrate, this is the man, Duclasse.

01:18:04.771 --> 01:18:06.689
Sit down, Duclasse.

01:18:08.942 --> 01:18:12.387
I thought you would see me alone.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:15.057
You're lucky to be seeing him at all.
Say what you have to say.

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.283
What makes you think
I can help you, Duclasse?

01:18:19.035 --> 01:18:21.438
Because you know I wouldn't kill Odette.

01:18:21.538 --> 01:18:24.191
How can you assume such a thing?

01:18:24.291 --> 01:18:25.859
I don't know you.

01:18:25.959 --> 01:18:27.527
You knew my wife well enough.

01:18:27.627 --> 01:18:30.739
- Duclasse!
- Please, Captain.

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:34.049
Under what circumstances
could I have known your wife?

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:38.220
Are you denying
that you wanted to marry her?

01:18:39.264 --> 01:18:43.293
This is preposterous, Duclasse.
You're making a grave mistake.

01:18:43.393 --> 01:18:45.253
Liar! What are you trying to hide?

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:47.130
That you would take
another man's wife away?

01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:50.316
That's enough, Duclasse! Guards!

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:51.984
I didn't kill Odette!

01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:55.946
Duclasse.

01:18:57.157 --> 01:18:58.809
If you think these accusations

01:18:58.909 --> 01:19:02.229
will influence the court
to declare you insane,

01:19:02.329 --> 01:19:04.147
you are quite mistaken.

01:19:04.247 --> 01:19:06.066
- Take him away.
- I won't let this rest!

01:19:06.166 --> 01:19:08.318
I didn't kill Odette! I didn't kill her!

01:19:08.418 --> 01:19:09.585
I didn't kill her!

01:19:10.587 --> 01:19:11.863
You see, Simon?

01:19:11.963 --> 01:19:14.548
What is there to understand
about the human mind?

01:19:15.133 --> 01:19:16.451
A person becomes evil.

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:18.370
How? Who knows?

01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:22.833
He is evil, so society must crush him
as if he were a bug.

01:19:22.933 --> 01:19:25.460
You think your studies are profound.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.021
I think that the only profound thing
is the guillotine.

01:19:30.774 --> 01:19:35.303
When I come across
such a brutal killer as Duclasse,

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:37.472
I begin to think you're right.

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:41.450
We must get together some evening
and discuss our points of view.

01:19:57.092 --> 01:20:00.469
Can it be only his reputation
he's afraid of, Jeanne?

01:20:01.596 --> 01:20:05.307
To deny knowing Odette or me.

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:11.047
Perhaps I had begun to hate Odette,
but I never would have killed her.

01:20:11.147 --> 01:20:15.135
Paul, Magistrate Cordier
wouldn't let an innocent man die

01:20:15.235 --> 01:20:17.345
just to save his own reputation.

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:18.513
Well, you should have seen him.

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.432
There was no sympathy in him, nothing.

01:20:20.532 --> 01:20:23.143
It was as if there were
no feeling of any kind.

01:20:23.243 --> 01:20:26.313
I don't even see any grief
for Odette in him.

01:20:26.413 --> 01:20:30.332
We're doing everything we can, Paul, and
somehow we're going to find out the truth.

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:38.825
I know how much you and your father
are trying to help me,

01:20:38.925 --> 01:20:41.385
and I'm very grateful.

01:20:43.013 --> 01:20:44.889
We don't want to lose you.

01:20:48.852 --> 01:20:52.146
How can a man be such a fool
about what is right?

01:20:53.231 --> 01:20:55.884
It's like an artist who wants
to say something fine on a canvas

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:59.028
and only paints the things
that blind his eye.

01:21:03.867 --> 01:21:05.659
Oh, Paul.

01:21:08.455 --> 01:21:11.040
I wanted to kiss you
when we were children.

01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:21.550
Oh, Paul, Paul.

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.973
What are we going to do?

01:21:35.607 --> 01:21:40.262
There has to be a way to prove
Cordier's relationship to Odette.

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:43.447
Odette never lived in a world by herself.

01:21:49.913 --> 01:21:52.065
I've learned today that I am to preside

01:21:52.165 --> 01:21:54.568
at the trial of Paul Duclasse.

01:21:54.668 --> 01:21:58.363
Whatever is left of my will,
of my conscience, rebels

01:21:58.463 --> 01:22:01.658
at sending an innocent man
to the guillotine.

01:22:01.758 --> 01:22:05.954
But I know now that I am helpless
under the Horla's influence.

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:10.041
I have become a slave, a machine
that must do his bidding.

01:22:10.141 --> 01:22:13.211
I have but one means of escape.

01:22:13.311 --> 01:22:16.339
May the Lord see fit
to grant me with mercy

01:22:16.439 --> 01:22:18.565
for what I am about to do.

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:42.240
Suicide, Magistrate?

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:45.926
Did you think I would let
your destruction be so simple?

01:22:51.683 --> 01:22:54.502
Did you want the gun, Magistrate?

01:23:04.821 --> 01:23:09.434
It seems that your will
surrenders most reluctantly.

01:23:09.534 --> 01:23:12.995
I must congratulate you
on your strength of character.

01:23:13.997 --> 01:23:18.575
Well, then, since I have regained
control once more, we can...

01:23:20.754 --> 01:23:23.881
The door, Magistrate.
Shall we see who it is?

01:23:39.105 --> 01:23:41.065
Is there something you wish?

01:23:41.941 --> 01:23:44.761
Don't you remember me, Magistrate Cordier?

01:23:44.861 --> 01:23:49.391
No, I'm sorry. Is there someone here
you wish to see?

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:52.060
Your memory is short.
I'm Jeanne D'Arville.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.146
You bought a painting from me
at my father's gallery.

01:23:55.246 --> 01:23:59.208
A painting? Oh, won't you please come in.

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:07.659
You must have the wrong address.
Perhaps I can help you.

01:24:07.759 --> 01:24:10.010
That's very possible.

01:24:11.846 --> 01:24:14.124
Would your coachman
have taken the wrong turn?

01:24:14.224 --> 01:24:18.477
I'm very good at remembering faces,
Magistrate, even if you're not.

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:28.096
A man has little difficulty recalling
a pretty face, Miss D'Arville.

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:31.224
Now, perhaps we can get
to the bottom of this.

01:24:31.324 --> 01:24:32.684
Oh, won't you sit down?

01:24:32.784 --> 01:24:34.701
No, thank you.

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:38.106
You denied knowing either
Odette Mallotte or Paul Duclasse.

01:24:38.206 --> 01:24:40.150
- Why?
- Oh, that again!

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:41.526
Is that what brought you here?

01:24:41.626 --> 01:24:43.236
I want to know why you lied.

01:24:43.336 --> 01:24:46.156
Under the circumstances,
I'm trying to be patient.

01:24:46.256 --> 01:24:49.409
Paul Duclasse doesn't have time
for patience.

01:24:49.509 --> 01:24:51.969
Since you won't tell me the truth,
perhaps your servants will.

01:24:52.137 --> 01:24:53.371
Really, Miss D'Arville,
I really think you...

01:24:53.471 --> 01:24:55.165
Where are they?

01:24:55.265 --> 01:24:56.791
They know Odette posed
for you in this house.

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:58.626
They also know Paul was here.

01:24:58.726 --> 01:25:02.547
I don't know where you and Duclasse
got this ridiculous notion,

01:25:02.647 --> 01:25:06.176
but, unfortunately, my servants
are in Switzerland.

01:25:06.276 --> 01:25:10.180
Now, I trust that that is an end
of your accusations.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.434
Oh, no, Magistrate Cordier,
this isn't the end.

01:25:14.534 --> 01:25:16.269
I'm sure the police will be interested

01:25:16.369 --> 01:25:19.439
in bringing your servants back
from Switzerland for questioning,

01:25:19.539 --> 01:25:22.833
even though you may prefer
leaving them where they are.

01:25:32.051 --> 01:25:33.844
Gallery D'Arville.

01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:48.885
A most determined young woman.

01:25:48.985 --> 01:25:52.764
There can be no doubt
that she will go to the police.

01:25:52.864 --> 01:25:57.618
Then, I can only hope
that nothing changes her mind.

01:25:58.745 --> 01:26:01.606
You still want to die.

01:26:01.706 --> 01:26:05.485
You chose the wrong one
for death, Magistrate.

01:26:05.585 --> 01:26:08.863
She will die, not you.

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:11.449
Leave her alone.

01:26:11.549 --> 01:26:14.343
You will kill her.

01:26:15.386 --> 01:26:19.806
No, I can't.

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:24.478
I can't kill again.

01:26:29.734 --> 01:26:32.945
Before the night is over, Magistrate.

01:26:33.112 --> 01:26:35.739
There isn't much time.

01:26:40.119 --> 01:26:43.080
But do you realize what this would mean?

01:26:43.248 --> 01:26:46.234
Accusing him before the police?

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.945
A man with such a fine reputation.

01:26:49.045 --> 01:26:51.656
I already know what they think.

01:26:51.756 --> 01:26:54.033
But Paul's entitled to justice.

01:26:54.133 --> 01:26:58.329
And I'm going to demand that they bring
the servants back to testify.

01:26:58.429 --> 01:27:00.748
Jeanne, you asked my advice.

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:03.918
I can only tell you
that I believe it will be useless.

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:08.647
Father, I'm going to the police.
It's all I can do to help Paul.

01:27:11.067 --> 01:27:13.553
I hope you're right.

01:27:13.653 --> 01:27:16.738
Perhaps I'm too old
to believe in miracles.

01:29:15.608 --> 01:29:20.888
Simon, what are you doing here
at this time of the night?

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:27.244
Father Raymonde, quickly,
take me to your church.

01:29:27.412 --> 01:29:28.938
Perhaps there is safety there.

01:29:29.038 --> 01:29:31.024
Simon, what are you saying?

01:29:31.124 --> 01:29:33.443
A sanctuary, Father.

01:29:33.543 --> 01:29:36.362
There's something that I must tell you.

01:29:36.462 --> 01:29:38.755
I must confess.

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:48.849
- Help me.
- Come with me.

01:29:54.063 --> 01:29:55.439
Whoa!

01:29:56.107 --> 01:29:57.190
Whoa!

01:29:58.025 --> 01:29:58.942
Whoa!

01:30:00.236 --> 01:30:01.496
Whoa!

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:03.697
Whoa!

01:30:08.119 --> 01:30:09.771
Father, are you all right?

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.439
What happened?

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.540
- I'm not sure.
- Whoa!

01:30:22.425 --> 01:30:24.035
- You're not hurt?
- No.

01:30:24.135 --> 01:30:25.302
Thank the Lord.

01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:28.956
Father, it happened so suddenly, as if
someone grabbed the reins from my hands.

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:31.709
He tried to kill both of us.

01:30:31.809 --> 01:30:34.045
Kill us! Simon, please explain.

01:30:34.145 --> 01:30:36.464
Father, I can't go with you now.

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.758
It would mean your life, too.

01:30:38.858 --> 01:30:42.553
Listen to me, do as I say.
There's a girl walking down the street.

01:30:42.653 --> 01:30:44.889
She can't be more than a few blocks away.

01:30:44.989 --> 01:30:48.810
You'll recognize her by the brown dress
and the plume hat she's wearing.

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:51.479
Her name is Jeanne D'Arville.

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:55.024
Tell her that I must see her
tonight at my house.

01:30:55.124 --> 01:30:58.293
Please, tell her to come.

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:06.911
The Horla has tried to kill me.

01:31:07.011 --> 01:31:10.305
I have become his enemy
instead of his slave.

01:31:10.473 --> 01:31:13.308
It is now his life or mine.

01:31:28.282 --> 01:31:30.977
Father, are you sure
he wanted me to come back?

01:31:31.077 --> 01:31:35.622
I don't know what is wrong,
but it was most important to him.

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:49.787
Father, thank you for coming.

01:31:49.887 --> 01:31:52.707
Forgive me, but I can't ask you in.

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:54.333
I hope there's time enough for this.

01:31:54.433 --> 01:31:57.670
Simon, there must be something
very wrong. Can't I help?

01:31:57.770 --> 01:32:00.965
No. No, this is something
I must do myself.

01:32:01.065 --> 01:32:02.967
Pray for me, Father.

01:32:03.067 --> 01:32:06.679
Take these. They're most important.

01:32:06.779 --> 01:32:09.056
It's imperative that you follow
the instructions

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.407
in the letter exactly.

01:32:10.575 --> 01:32:12.143
- I don't know what these are.
- Please.

01:32:12.243 --> 01:32:13.853
Please take her away, Father.

01:32:13.953 --> 01:32:15.370
Go, I beg of you.

01:32:15.538 --> 01:32:17.273
Simon, you will have my prayers.

01:32:17.373 --> 01:32:19.108
I think we better do as he says.

01:32:19.208 --> 01:32:21.376
- Good night.
- Good night, Father.

01:32:31.721 --> 01:32:34.040
Something has occurred to me.

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:37.392
Something that happened the night
the Horla made me destroy

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.712
the painting of Odette.

01:32:39.812 --> 01:32:44.300
If my observation is correct,
then I will be staking my life

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:48.361
on the turn of one solitary card.

01:32:50.615 --> 01:32:56.062
If I am wrong, then, this will be
my last meeting with him.

01:32:56.162 --> 01:32:58.022
He will kill me.

01:32:58.122 --> 01:33:02.626
I have made my preparations. I am ready.

01:33:22.188 --> 01:33:24.924
You seem very smug, Magistrate.

01:33:25.024 --> 01:33:28.652
Is it because I failed
to make you kill the girl?

01:33:30.321 --> 01:33:34.767
Do you think that evil can always
be stopped by a cross?

01:33:34.867 --> 01:33:36.310
Perhaps not,

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:41.998
but there may be something
that can stop your evil.

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:48.948
You remember the painting?

01:33:49.048 --> 01:33:51.325
How you insisted that I burn it?

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:55.512
Could it be that you were afraid to go
near the flames in the fireplace?

01:33:56.222 --> 01:33:59.250
Fire has no will of its own!
Can you control it?

01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:03.713
Try! Let me see how fast your powers are!

01:34:03.813 --> 01:34:04.880
Let me out!

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.924
There's no place to run.

01:34:07.024 --> 01:34:09.317
The windows are in flames.
The doors are locked.

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.055
- Let me out!
- You're trapped.

01:34:13.155 --> 01:34:15.990
The whole room is drenched in kerosene.

01:34:19.578 --> 01:34:21.022
How does terror feel?

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:23.707
Doesn't it give you enough strength
to break a lock?

01:34:25.501 --> 01:34:26.918
Let me out!

01:34:27.503 --> 01:34:29.572
I was right about the fire.

01:34:29.672 --> 01:34:32.207
Then, you'll die with...

01:35:31.984 --> 01:35:35.054
The last words he wrote:

01:35:35.154 --> 01:35:39.266
"If what I think is true, then, there
may be deliverance from the Horla

01:35:39.366 --> 01:35:42.118
for me or all of us."

01:35:43.162 --> 01:35:47.024
Are you convinced now
that Paul didn't murder Odette?

01:35:47.124 --> 01:35:49.527
The diary will clear him.

01:35:49.627 --> 01:35:51.753
Poor Simon.

01:35:52.296 --> 01:35:55.366
He was ill for so long.
The insanity grew worse.

01:35:55.466 --> 01:35:57.076
He didn't know what he was doing.

01:35:57.176 --> 01:36:00.246
This Horla,
it was in his imagination, of course.

01:36:00.346 --> 01:36:04.875
Can it be denied that evil exists
or that it can possess a man?

01:36:04.975 --> 01:36:08.603
Then, Cordier was saying
the Horla is real.

01:36:08.771 --> 01:36:12.065
Simon's letter spoke of a warning
to mankind.

01:36:12.566 --> 01:36:14.385
He wanted us to know.

01:36:14.485 --> 01:36:18.431
Whenever evil exists in the heart of man,

01:36:18.531 --> 01:36:21.157
the Horla lives.
