WEBVTT

01:24.417 --> 01:25.752
Hey, no.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.188
Ah, stop it, hey!

01:28.788 --> 01:31.424
I'll sometimes be a hound.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.392
A hog.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.426
A hog.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.729
A headless bear,

01:35.762 --> 01:37.664
sometimes a fire.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.166
Who neigh and bark

01:39.200 --> 01:41.701
and grunt and roar and burn.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.288
Come on.

02:10.031 --> 02:10.931
Did you do that?

02:14.402 --> 02:15.970
Here you go, more veggies.

02:52.006 --> 02:52.807
Dara?

02:53.808 --> 02:54.607
Dara?

02:56.277 --> 02:57.378
It's still too dry.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.879
You're gonna start a fire.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.015
But you're right here!

03:06.753 --> 03:07.587
Darling.

03:08.555 --> 03:09.390
Come eat!

03:11.758 --> 03:12.659
Sam's bringing ice?

03:12.692 --> 03:14.095
He's supposed to.

03:14.128 --> 03:16.030
Good 'cause
these coolers are a mess.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.232
Yeah she left over
an hour ago with Em.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.500
Still no meat?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.403
No more
dead things for me.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.770
That's too bad.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.604
I'm kind of worried.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.140
Lila, stop it.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.046
Are you
tracking her phone?

03:32.079 --> 03:32.913
Almost here.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.317
Ooh, she stopped at the falls.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.252
Hmm, what is she
doing at the falls?

03:39.387 --> 03:42.023
She's gonna be gone
for several weeks.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.424
What do you think her
and Emmi are doing?

03:43.457 --> 03:44.291
Arguing.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.460
I don't think she's
ready to sail out

03:46.494 --> 03:47.862
on the Atlantic alone.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.230
She's not gonna be alone.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.267
She's gonna be part of a crew.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.402
She's gonna be okay.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.236
I know.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.105
Hey Jake, Jake.

03:58.139 --> 03:59.440
Yeah?

03:59.473 --> 04:00.941
Those fridges are too full.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.510
Stick these back in the creek

04:02.542 --> 04:03.411
- and get your sister to help.
- All right.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.412
Beer please.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.982
Thank you, I'm a victim.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.283
Mom, I'm gonna
have one too, okay?

04:09.316 --> 04:10.151
No.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.154
What time should I have Jake
and Charlotte ready tomorrow?

04:13.187 --> 04:13.988
For camp?

04:14.021 --> 04:15.789
Six?

04:15.823 --> 04:16.723
That's early.

04:16.755 --> 04:17.892
Are you dropping Sam off?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.625
No, Emmi's dropping
Sam to the port

04:19.659 --> 04:21.295
so we can drop the kids at camp

04:21.327 --> 04:24.098
and then he has a
red eye to catch.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.299
I'm
worried about traffic

04:25.332 --> 04:27.301
but I think everything's
gonna be okay.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.369
Staying positive.

04:30.905 --> 04:32.440
I thought you
were all done with LA.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.175
I'm done,
but script's not.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.543
They paid you yet?

04:35.575 --> 04:36.811
What?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.045
Mind your own business.

04:38.079 --> 04:39.046
Edgar.

04:39.080 --> 04:39.880
It's funny.

04:39.914 --> 04:40.747
No it's not.

04:41.916 --> 04:43.417
I'm gonna
put the burgers away.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.919
Sweetheart will you just

04:44.952 --> 04:46.220
make sure you save one for Dara?

04:46.253 --> 04:48.355
She's not gonna eat it.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.358
Dara?

04:51.392 --> 04:52.893
- Grill's done.
- It's not like I was him

04:52.927 --> 04:56.030
but I guess I kind of felt
everything he was feeling.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.198
Yeah but now you'll
never really know

04:57.231 --> 04:58.698
'cause you had a dream about it

04:58.731 --> 05:00.334
and now you have this idea
about what it should be.

05:00.367 --> 05:01.734
Did mom say you
could have that?

05:01.768 --> 05:02.870
Yeah.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.637
Charlotte's
smoking now.

05:04.671 --> 05:05.573
Hey!

05:05.605 --> 05:07.808
In her dreams.

05:07.842 --> 05:09.076
She had a dream about it

05:09.110 --> 05:10.010
and now she actually
has to smoke to see

05:10.044 --> 05:10.845
if it was right.

05:10.878 --> 05:11.678
Do it.

05:11.711 --> 05:12.880
No, I don't have to

05:12.913 --> 05:14.747
because I already
know how it is.

05:14.781 --> 05:16.217
You think you know.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.686
Jeez.

05:19.719 --> 05:20.955
Let's get Grenadine.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.334
Don't move.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.701
Good one, ladies.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.669
All right, it's not funny.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.074
Did you eat?

05:42.009 --> 05:44.411
No sugar until you've
eaten something.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.678
Not with your hands.

05:45.712 --> 05:46.547
Whatever.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.481
Baby, get a broom.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.748
But you said not to move.

05:50.985 --> 05:53.053
Dara, just get a broom.

06:00.727 --> 06:02.863
Edgar, don't take
a call just now.

06:02.897 --> 06:04.098
Just producers.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.366
They're not gonna
be reachable later.

06:08.169 --> 06:09.003
Hey.

06:10.004 --> 06:10.838
Gimme a second.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.408
Hold on a second.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.730
What's going on?

06:37.764 --> 06:39.200
Hey Edgar, it's me.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.434
We're here.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.535
No, no, no, no put that down.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.735
That's
two weeks early.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.072
Yeah
two weeks for you.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.507
You should have called sooner.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.109
Well we had other
things to think about.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.444
Yeah, I'm sorry.

06:50.477 --> 06:51.679
That's okay.

06:51.711 --> 06:52.479
- Yeah, I got it, I got it.
- Please,

06:52.513 --> 06:53.713
can I talk to Gemma?

06:53.746 --> 06:55.349
Hey Gemma, I
have Edgar on the phone.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.318
Do you wanna talk to him?

06:57.351 --> 06:59.119
Hi, hey.

06:59.153 --> 06:59.987
You okay honey?

07:00.888 --> 07:01.721
Please.

07:04.058 --> 07:05.693
Let this be over.

07:05.725 --> 07:06.860
Edgar, can you
hold on for a minute?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.562
I think she's having
a contraction.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.331
- How far apart are they?
- Breathe, Gem.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.599
Easy.

07:11.632 --> 07:15.069
They're nine minutes
apart, nine minutes.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.441
Gemma.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.143
Gemma, can you see me?

07:23.177 --> 07:24.378
Can you see me?

07:24.411 --> 07:25.946
Actually
I got it from here.

07:25.980 --> 07:27.414
He's almost here.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.482
- Yes.
- Yes, you're almost done.

07:28.515 --> 07:29.617
He's almost here.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.684
Almost here.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.086
Almost here.

07:37.191 --> 07:38.158
Edgar?

07:38.192 --> 07:39.393
I'm on the phone.

07:44.198 --> 07:45.699
Hey, this is gonna take
as long as it takes

07:45.733 --> 07:47.601
and then I'll have to turn
pages around by tonight.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.271
Well, I'm just worried
Sam's not back yet.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.406
Call her.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.773
I did, she's not picking up.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.975
Her phone's still at the falls.

07:55.009 --> 07:57.645
Well then she's
probably at the falls.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.479
She's fine.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.093
Ossie, come here.

08:14.295 --> 08:15.696
You okay?

08:15.729 --> 08:17.197
Mom.

08:17.231 --> 08:18.065
Sam?

08:19.033 --> 08:19.933
Sorry.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.201
I had a migraine coming on.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.136
- I had to walk it off.
- You should lie down.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.871
It's fine, let me help.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.905
Emmi.

08:24.938 --> 08:25.739
Did you eat?

08:25.773 --> 08:27.007
Uh no.

08:27.041 --> 08:28.275
Can I pack
you something to go?

08:28.309 --> 08:29.877
Oh no, I'm sorry I
gotta go, thank you.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.111
Hey, I'll see you tomorrow,

08:31.145 --> 08:32.346
- okay?
- Hey.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.580
Bye buddy.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.548
Bye guys.

08:42.121 --> 08:42.956
You okay?

08:42.990 --> 08:43.890
Yeah.

08:43.924 --> 08:44.825
Are you sure about tomorrow?

08:44.858 --> 08:45.926
I'll pick you up at six.

08:45.959 --> 08:46.794
Good.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.728
Bye, guys.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.962
- Come on.
- Bye, Emmi.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.064
Bye.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.666
Everything all right?

08:52.700 --> 08:53.634
Mom, this is Jonah.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.169
He's taking my shift at the coop

08:55.202 --> 08:56.303
while I'm on the boat.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.740
- Hi, hello.
- Hi.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.976
He taught that
biodynamic farming workshop

09:03.010 --> 09:05.245
- I told you about.
- Yeah.

09:05.279 --> 09:06.180
Please eat.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.382
And I think you should lie down.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.017
- Have a burger.
- Mom, stop.

09:10.050 --> 09:10.851
- Here.
- Stop.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.685
Burger?

09:11.719 --> 09:12.553
Please.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.989
Well I think that's
homemade onion rings.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.057
Where's Dad?

09:17.091 --> 09:17.925
Guess.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.327
On the phone?

09:20.361 --> 09:21.261
On my fingers?

09:21.295 --> 09:22.563
Work, work, work.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.699
You gonna eat?

09:31.538 --> 09:32.606
Do you hear it?

09:32.639 --> 09:33.808
Do you hear the heartbeat?

09:33.842 --> 09:35.743
Edgar, do you hear
the heartbeat?

09:35.776 --> 09:36.944
Yeah.

09:36.977 --> 09:37.911
You okay?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.281
Sounds good.

09:41.315 --> 09:42.149
Sounds strong.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.819
Hand me that tea.

09:46.821 --> 09:47.654
My mouth, it's dry as shit.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.591
How dilated is she?

09:50.624 --> 09:53.828
About seven,
seven centimeters.

09:53.862 --> 09:54.762
Seven centimeters.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.929
Seven centimeters?

09:57.531 --> 09:58.365
What's going on?

10:08.509 --> 10:10.244
Oh my god, oh my god.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.022
Is that it?

10:22.055 --> 10:23.056
Yeah, here.

10:28.262 --> 10:29.163
I don't feel it.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.498
It's very deep.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.634
Like a treasure.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.537
That's it.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.443
Wouldn't it be great
if he just chopped him up

10:42.476 --> 10:43.878
and that was it?

10:43.912 --> 10:46.213
Dora?

10:51.018 --> 10:52.152
You sure you want me crowding

10:52.186 --> 10:53.888
your last few weeks of peace?

10:55.389 --> 10:56.190
Yes please.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.227
'Cause it's
not gonna be pretty.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.528
I'll try to remember that.

11:01.562 --> 11:02.396
Please do.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.331
Ugh.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.200
Right?

11:10.237 --> 11:12.239
Is he a
ghost or a real guy?

11:13.674 --> 11:16.543
A ghost but he's real
when he's killing people.

11:16.577 --> 11:17.444
That's stupid.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.380
Mama, your poor boob.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.283
I don't want them
to cut into it.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.085
Me neither.

11:25.954 --> 11:27.856
But it's done its big job.

11:27.889 --> 11:29.656
You're finally weaned, right?

11:30.991 --> 11:31.992
Mom, don't be disgusting.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.796
Go watch
if you want to.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.465
Go, off!

11:38.499 --> 11:39.633
Go watch.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.643
Sauna?

11:49.676 --> 11:51.645
Sauna.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.055
Oh, sorry.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.190
- Didn't know you're here.
- No.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.024
We can go.

12:04.057 --> 12:04.993
Sorry, we didn't know

12:05.025 --> 12:06.260
- you were here.
- No, it's okay.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.194
We've been here a
while, we can go.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.395
We can come back later.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.796
No, nobody's gotta
go, we all fit.

12:22.010 --> 12:23.878
Oh you can't do that in here.

12:23.912 --> 12:25.914
In the heat, can you?

12:25.947 --> 12:29.017
We're keeping
that tray down.

12:37.892 --> 12:39.827
You at the co-op this summer?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.004
Lila and I worked at the co-op

12:50.038 --> 12:51.940
about a million years ago.

12:51.973 --> 12:54.341
I think everybody out
here has at some point.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.076
Where are you from?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.377
Oregon.

12:57.411 --> 12:59.047
That's a
long way from home.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.082
It's all home.

13:03.517 --> 13:04.418
It can't all be home,

13:04.451 --> 13:05.218
then none of it's special.

13:07.021 --> 13:07.989
It's all special.

13:10.591 --> 13:11.926
You smoked enough.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.195
I'm teasing.

13:20.001 --> 13:20.902
You ready to go?

13:22.202 --> 13:24.137
Yeah in a little bit.

13:34.916 --> 13:37.018
Did Sam tell you
about her sailing trip?

13:39.186 --> 13:40.420
Yeah she told me.

13:40.454 --> 13:41.688
Yeah but
she's taking Prozac

13:41.722 --> 13:43.190
which doesn't work
if you smoke pot.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.391
Lila, stop.

13:47.095 --> 13:48.428
Well, we're just talking.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.665
Well she hasn't taken
Prozac in three months.

13:52.834 --> 13:54.167
What?

13:54.201 --> 13:56.637
Sam told you she was
gonna stop the meds.

13:58.106 --> 14:01.141
She also told you she still
smoked pot on occasion.

14:10.818 --> 14:12.686
So Sam says that
you're an artist.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.290
I teach.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.559
Where?

14:19.593 --> 14:21.129
The community college.

14:28.635 --> 14:32.106
Biodynamic farming,
that's Steiner, right?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.111
Yeah it's approaching
the whole farm

14:37.145 --> 14:38.745
as a living organism.

14:39.914 --> 14:42.182
Treating it like an
energetic life force.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.818
You have to study a long time?

14:45.419 --> 14:49.057
Not in a building, books
or loans or anything but,

14:51.324 --> 14:52.827
I study all the time.

14:52.860 --> 14:54.461
What are
you studying now?

14:55.930 --> 14:58.498
Right now I'm reading The
Critique of Reason by Kant.

15:02.170 --> 15:05.372
Nobody really reads Kant.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.278
You can read my margin notes.

15:12.914 --> 15:15.215
No, that's okay.

15:19.553 --> 15:21.089
You studying anything?

15:23.290 --> 15:24.125
Inertia.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.181
Push, push for me.

15:47.215 --> 15:47.982
- Push.
- I see it!

15:48.015 --> 15:48.983
There's a head,

15:49.016 --> 15:50.250
- There's a head!
- Gemma, Gemma.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.185
You got this, come on.

15:51.219 --> 15:52.053
You're so close.

15:52.086 --> 15:52.987
Please.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.155
- Come on, Gemma.
- Oh my god!

15:54.188 --> 15:55.890
Push, Gemma,
Gemma, Gemma, push.

15:55.923 --> 15:57.257
Push, please push.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.625
- Camera, camera!
- I see hair,

15:58.658 --> 15:59.994
I see hair!

16:00.027 --> 16:03.630
He has curly hair like you!

16:03.663 --> 16:04.464
Push, push.

16:04.498 --> 16:06.500
Yeah, more, more.

16:08.069 --> 16:09.402
You did
it, you did it,

16:09.436 --> 16:11.505
you did it, you did it.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.539
Oh my god.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.409
You're my baby.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.778
Oh my gosh.

16:17.812 --> 16:19.847
You did good, you did good.

16:19.881 --> 16:21.082
My baby.

16:21.115 --> 16:24.317
You did so
good, my goodness.

16:26.988 --> 16:29.422
This is my baby.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.097
Oh he's so beautiful.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.569
Oh so cute.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.910
You wanna lie down, baby?

16:48.943 --> 16:50.410
Wanna sit down?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.280
You're okay like this.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.681
Like this baby.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.421
It's so bright outside, I know.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.489
Maybe you're cold.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.028
Maybe you're cold a little bit.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.896
Oh my god.

17:09.931 --> 17:11.330
Hey can
you believe it?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.467
You did it.

17:21.473 --> 17:26.479
Oh man.

18:18.232 --> 18:19.867
Chloe, Mira.

18:19.901 --> 18:21.235
We're
gonna miss you.

18:21.269 --> 18:22.736
You have the cooler?

18:22.769 --> 18:23.570
I do.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.704
All right, see you Sam.

18:24.738 --> 18:26.506
Have fun on your boat ride.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.540
Bye.

18:29.310 --> 18:30.244
Good night.

18:30.278 --> 18:31.112
Good night.

18:41.322 --> 18:42.156
You okay?

18:43.024 --> 18:43.858
Bye.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.431
Bye.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.134
Go to sleep early.

18:53.167 --> 18:54.734
See you at
the crack of dawn.

18:54.768 --> 18:55.635
Six?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.174
Good night.

19:01.909 --> 19:02.977
Good night.

19:03.010 --> 19:03.978
Bye.

19:04.011 --> 19:05.846
Thanks for the salad.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.048
Yeah.

19:08.182 --> 19:09.016
I gotta pack.

19:54.428 --> 19:55.229
Gigi.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.599
You need to take a Vicodin.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.601
I'm not taking the Vicodin.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.870
No, I'm not taking it.

20:02.903 --> 20:04.372
Flush it for me.

20:04.405 --> 20:05.572
Don't be brave.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.308
No, no.

20:07.341 --> 20:08.575
I mean it, flush it.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.415
I'm serious.

20:14.448 --> 20:16.183
Look I'll smoke a
joint if I have to

20:16.217 --> 20:18.252
and I'm gonna focus
on these pain buns.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.786
I'm not
going to flush them.

20:22.923 --> 20:25.092
What do you call that
thing they live in?

20:25.126 --> 20:28.896
All the tunnels that connect?

20:28.929 --> 20:29.763
A warren?

20:31.765 --> 20:32.565
Warren.

20:45.246 --> 20:46.180
Hi, sweetheart.

20:46.213 --> 20:48.015
Hey, you still in bed?

20:48.049 --> 20:48.849
No.

20:50.217 --> 20:51.419
No.

20:51.452 --> 20:52.652
You're in
the garden, aren't you?

20:54.554 --> 20:55.456
What are you
doing up so early?

20:56.457 --> 20:58.959
Couldn't sleep.

20:58.993 --> 21:00.161
Is this a good time?

21:00.194 --> 21:01.095
'Cause I could call
you back later.

21:01.128 --> 21:02.063
No, no, this is a good time.

21:02.096 --> 21:03.064
How's Gigi?

21:03.097 --> 21:04.231
Sure she's okay?

21:04.265 --> 21:05.366
She's fine.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.667
Any infections?

21:07.700 --> 21:08.502
No infections.

21:08.536 --> 21:10.938
She's just, she's tired.

21:10.971 --> 21:13.207
I gotta
tell you something

21:13.240 --> 21:14.241
about Gemma.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.545
I thought
you said that you

21:17.577 --> 21:18.913
weren't seeing her anymore.

21:24.018 --> 21:24.852
Edgar.

21:29.256 --> 21:30.091
How long?

21:35.296 --> 21:36.130
What?

21:40.568 --> 21:41.368
God!

21:46.606 --> 21:47.808
God!

22:24.378 --> 22:25.678
You can stay a couple
nights in the girls' room

22:25.712 --> 22:29.083
but I need you to
find someplace else.

22:34.787 --> 22:39.226
I wasn't
planning on staying here.

22:39.260 --> 22:40.760
We found a sublet in Brooklyn.

22:43.230 --> 22:44.498
They're coming next week.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.504
The city?

22:53.374 --> 22:54.774
I take it you were paid then?

22:56.410 --> 22:57.278
No.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.381
In fact the production company

23:00.414 --> 23:02.183
is filing for
bankruptcy next week.

23:06.086 --> 23:07.821
So you haven't
even been working.

23:12.126 --> 23:14.428
I have a ghostwriting
gig coming up.

23:16.297 --> 23:18.832
She still write for
that stupid television show?

23:18.866 --> 23:19.699
Yeah.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.770
You should write for TV.

23:24.638 --> 23:26.173
I don't wanna write for TV.

23:30.878 --> 23:33.214
I have a check I can
deposit in a couple weeks.

23:37.885 --> 23:39.786
All this stress,
are you happy?

23:40.921 --> 23:41.754
Yeah.

23:45.659 --> 23:48.596
No, I'm not happy
when you're not happy.

23:51.098 --> 23:53.367
But otherwise, yeah, I'm happy.

23:54.702 --> 23:56.103
And I think I make her happy.

23:58.372 --> 23:59.206
No.

24:00.174 --> 24:01.075
You made me happy.

24:02.376 --> 24:03.677
Maybe sometimes, but,

24:04.845 --> 24:06.779
mostly you pretend to be happy.

24:06.814 --> 24:08.282
Because you're not there.

24:10.050 --> 24:12.253
Because you lie to me.

24:12.286 --> 24:14.054
When you lie to
her, is she happy?

24:16.657 --> 24:18.425
I don't lie to her.

24:18.459 --> 24:20.760
You will.

24:28.202 --> 24:29.503
I have to find my passport.

24:43.250 --> 24:44.285
Where do you
think you're going?

24:44.318 --> 24:45.686
I'm not going anywhere.

24:45.719 --> 24:48.155
It's just something
grownup people should have.

24:49.390 --> 24:50.891
And when she's not
happy anymore, Edgar,

24:50.924 --> 24:53.327
will she pretend for you?

24:53.360 --> 24:54.762
She will.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.430
She's younger and
she's got money too

24:56.463 --> 24:59.333
so you're gonna have to
become a better liar for her

24:59.366 --> 25:00.534
than you were for me.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.769
You know that, right?

25:03.170 --> 25:05.306
Don't walk away from me.

25:05.339 --> 25:08.042
Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

25:09.209 --> 25:10.744
Lila,
what do you want?

25:16.083 --> 25:17.451
What do you want?

25:17.484 --> 25:22.489
I don't know.

25:41.175 --> 25:42.009
Lila?

25:52.086 --> 25:52.886
Hello?

26:04.198 --> 26:05.032
Lila?

26:12.573 --> 26:13.707
Jesus.

26:20.114 --> 26:22.015
You're taking on this room?

26:22.049 --> 26:24.651
Well it's time
Sam has her own room.

26:24.685 --> 26:26.587
Dara ready
to sleep on her own?

26:26.620 --> 26:27.856
She's gonna have to be.

26:30.958 --> 26:33.694
This is
for soup, right?

26:37.164 --> 26:37.998
Take it.

26:46.039 --> 26:48.075
I thought you were
picking me up today.

26:51.578 --> 26:53.514
Oh, god, I'm sorry,

26:53.547 --> 26:54.348
- that was today.
- No, that's fine.

26:54.381 --> 26:55.449
I called my sister.

26:55.482 --> 26:56.717
She came and got me.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.085
- No, no, no, no.
- No, it's funny,

26:58.118 --> 27:00.254
she is sweet, actually.

27:01.622 --> 27:03.757
And we went back
to her place after.

27:03.791 --> 27:05.459
She gave me my aunt's drum

27:06.593 --> 27:09.696
and found this sweet
young thing to come over

27:09.730 --> 27:11.331
and give me a lesson.

27:11.365 --> 27:13.600
It got my heart really beating.

27:13.634 --> 27:16.136
I asked her to drive me

27:16.170 --> 27:17.137
to the next session

27:17.171 --> 27:18.472
- as well.
- You don't have to do,

27:18.505 --> 27:19.406
- don't have to do that.
- No, it's fine.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.141
I want to, it's good for us.

27:21.175 --> 27:22.009
How's Edgar?

27:26.547 --> 27:28.749
No, I would say it's not good.

27:28.782 --> 27:29.783
I mean it's,

27:31.185 --> 27:35.289
when he was away working,
it felt different and

27:37.458 --> 27:39.660
I could imagine him coming back,

27:39.693 --> 27:41.762
but this is like, I don't know.

27:43.898 --> 27:45.999
This is like he got
ripped away, like,

27:48.769 --> 27:49.636
like he's dead.

27:58.178 --> 28:01.181
That kind of absence
is suffocating.

28:03.083 --> 28:03.885
I mean I,

28:08.522 --> 28:09.756
I think that it
will be good for us

28:09.790 --> 28:11.525
to take space and
make room, because

28:12.759 --> 28:14.995
if we make room
then we can begin

28:15.028 --> 28:16.196
to forgive each other.

28:17.998 --> 28:19.132
There's still a we?

28:21.635 --> 28:22.937
Of course there is.

28:22.971 --> 28:24.906
We went through this
before, you know that.

28:24.939 --> 28:27.174
Oh Lila,
yes, I remember.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.509
Yeah we worked it out before,

28:28.542 --> 28:30.377
we're gonna work
it out this time.

28:30.410 --> 28:31.411
Not with a baby.

28:31.445 --> 28:32.646
Well that's how I got Sam.

28:32.679 --> 28:34.949
No, that was
totally different.

28:34.983 --> 28:36.818
Maddie died.

28:36.851 --> 28:41.388
This woman has a baby and
an apartment in the city.

28:43.724 --> 28:45.058
You should be
careful with that.

28:48.963 --> 28:50.597
Have you even
seen this baby yet?

28:50.631 --> 28:51.765
No.

28:51.798 --> 28:52.934
Have the girls?

28:52.967 --> 28:53.868
Because they
don't know about it

28:53.902 --> 28:55.937
and he hasn't posted anything.

28:55.970 --> 28:57.204
Well, she will have.

28:57.237 --> 28:58.071
Stop it.

29:01.508 --> 29:02.376
I found her.

29:02.409 --> 29:04.144
Stop.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.679
Lila you should look.

29:05.712 --> 29:06.915
You know, I don't tell you
what to do with your cancer

29:06.948 --> 29:09.918
so please don't tell me
what to do with Edgar.

29:09.951 --> 29:11.351
They're not
exactly equivalent.

29:11.385 --> 29:12.519
Yeah of course not,

29:12.553 --> 29:13.787
because nothing
compares with cancer.

29:13.821 --> 29:15.255
Oh we're competing now?

29:15.289 --> 29:16.323
You see, you never
believed in us.

29:16.356 --> 29:18.225
You just thought that this was

29:18.258 --> 29:19.493
all about Maddie and that I'm

29:19.526 --> 29:21.061
some sort of substitute.

29:21.094 --> 29:23.697
Oh I never said
that, you said that.

29:23.730 --> 29:24.531
No.

29:24.565 --> 29:26.000
Don't be an idiot!

29:28.302 --> 29:29.369
I don't have time for this.

29:29.403 --> 29:30.470
Yeah.

29:30.504 --> 29:31.305
Neither do I.

29:45.385 --> 29:46.219
Oh.

29:52.961 --> 29:54.294
Well there's room for more.

29:55.696 --> 29:58.365
Edgar has to go through
the rest of his stuff.

29:58.398 --> 29:59.533
When's he moving out?

30:02.102 --> 30:03.570
Who said he was moving out?

30:04.705 --> 30:06.908
I mean I just ran
into Gigi at the co-op.

30:06.941 --> 30:08.076
I asked if,

30:08.108 --> 30:09.610
She tell you
about the baby too?

30:13.848 --> 30:14.949
Oh.

30:16.985 --> 30:17.819
Take it.

30:19.286 --> 30:20.120
No.

30:21.355 --> 30:22.623
It's all right.

30:23.590 --> 30:25.125
Take it.

30:25.158 --> 30:26.727
Take it or empty your truck.

30:43.044 --> 30:43.845
How far is she?

30:43.878 --> 30:44.846
Nova Scotia.

30:44.879 --> 30:45.913
For real?

30:45.947 --> 30:47.414
She's not sick anymore.

30:47.447 --> 30:48.715
She said the trick is
that you look at the ocean

30:48.749 --> 30:51.151
and then you don't
feel so trapped.

30:54.421 --> 30:55.355
Did you tell her?

30:57.892 --> 31:00.560
Well, I just told her
that you were working.

31:02.997 --> 31:05.465
I really should
get back to the city.

31:05.499 --> 31:07.200
You were gonna
show me some bills.

31:11.672 --> 31:13.107
I paid the cellphones

31:13.141 --> 31:15.709
but we still have
to pay the mortgage.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.580
You know I was cleaning
out the spare room

31:22.150 --> 31:24.518
and I saved the table
chairs for you so

31:25.887 --> 31:27.021
I don't know maybe you
wanna just go back up there

31:27.055 --> 31:28.689
and see if there's
anything that you want.

31:28.722 --> 31:30.724
It's a sublet, it's
already furnished.

31:32.526 --> 31:33.593
You still have the high chair.

31:33.627 --> 31:35.129
She had a shower in LA

31:35.163 --> 31:37.031
so we don't need anything.

31:38.498 --> 31:39.867
I could take care of these.

31:41.102 --> 31:41.903
How?

31:44.438 --> 31:45.405
Archangel Michael.

31:46.673 --> 31:48.742
My brother wants to
buy Archangel Michael.

32:29.817 --> 32:33.520
The house is yours, Lila.

32:37.724 --> 32:40.260
But if you feel like you
can't pay the mortgage or,

32:44.364 --> 32:45.432
you should just sell.

32:46.801 --> 32:48.069
I mean, 30 minutes
north you could find

32:48.102 --> 32:49.569
something bigger, cheaper.

32:53.473 --> 32:54.909
I wasn't pretending, Edgar.

32:59.080 --> 32:59.914
Don't.

33:01.281 --> 33:02.083
Don't what?

33:02.116 --> 33:03.316
Don't be nice to me.

33:04.351 --> 33:05.253
Why not?

33:05.285 --> 33:06.286
Because I can't.

33:09.556 --> 33:11.225
God it's hard enough
to live one life,

33:11.259 --> 33:14.896
I can't even imagine what
it's like to live two.

33:14.929 --> 33:16.396
Well it's a mistake
you would never make.

33:16.429 --> 33:18.698
Well, I could accept Gem.

33:18.732 --> 33:19.666
I can love your son.

33:19.699 --> 33:20.835
Stop.

33:20.868 --> 33:21.969
I've done it before.

33:22.003 --> 33:22.804
I love Sam.

33:22.837 --> 33:24.872
I know, I know.

33:24.906 --> 33:27.008
But we can't do this anymore.

33:30.178 --> 33:34.314
There's just nothing
that I could tell the girls

33:34.347 --> 33:37.852
that would stop them from
hating you if you leave again.

33:37.885 --> 33:40.453
It wasn't just me that
hurt them last time.

33:40.487 --> 33:41.454
Yeah well this time,

33:42.924 --> 33:45.358
it's on your terms so
if you turn that down,

33:46.426 --> 33:47.460
it's on you.

33:47.494 --> 33:48.662
- Don't.
- Don't what?

33:48.695 --> 33:50.097
Don't bait me into
humiliating you.

33:54.202 --> 33:55.769
You've already humiliated me.

34:00.774 --> 34:01.741
Repeatedly.

34:06.214 --> 34:08.581
We can't be married anymore.

34:17.791 --> 34:18.893
Are you done?

34:21.628 --> 34:23.331
Yeah, I really
should get going.

34:28.235 --> 34:29.070
Edgar.

34:32.472 --> 34:33.975
This is really, no
but there's left

34:34.007 --> 34:35.641
for you to run from, I mean,

34:36.811 --> 34:38.980
the least you could do
is finish your meal.

34:42.049 --> 34:42.884
All right.

34:49.023 --> 34:51.893
Could you pick some
blackberries in a minute?

36:05.132 --> 36:07.301
Have the ants started
coming in the house yet?

36:09.769 --> 36:10.603
Lila?

36:49.010 --> 36:50.044
It's a little bitter.

36:51.711 --> 36:53.814
I used Stevia,
maybe not enough?

36:53.848 --> 36:56.516
No, I mean it's
fine, it's fine, it's just,

37:02.356 --> 37:03.491
You're right.

37:03.523 --> 37:04.724
- No, no, don't.
- No.

37:04.758 --> 37:05.926
No, I didn't mean
to be critical.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.794
It is too bitter,
okay, I'm sorry.

37:07.828 --> 37:09.030
What, what
are you talking about?

37:09.063 --> 37:09.964
Lila?

37:13.968 --> 37:14.902
Drink this.

37:14.935 --> 37:15.836
You need to vomit.

37:18.172 --> 37:20.174
- Wha...
- I fed you Gigi's Vicodin.

37:20.207 --> 37:21.976
- What?
- Yeah.

37:22.009 --> 37:22.810
How much?

37:22.843 --> 37:23.643
Drink it.

37:23.676 --> 37:24.577
I don't know how much.

37:24.611 --> 37:25.379
We can talk about this later.

37:25.413 --> 37:26.380
You have to drink this!

37:27.882 --> 37:28.715
Now!

37:33.854 --> 37:34.687
Whole thing.

37:50.637 --> 37:51.872
Fuck!

37:57.244 --> 37:58.012
Fuck.

38:00.214 --> 38:01.048
Now this.

38:03.984 --> 38:05.086
You tried to kill me!

38:05.119 --> 38:07.288
No, I don't know.

38:07.321 --> 38:08.122
I don't know what I was doing.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.957
I don't know why.

38:09.990 --> 38:11.826
I just had to do something,
that's what I did.

38:11.859 --> 38:14.028
Yeah you're fucking
crazy is that's what.

38:16.430 --> 38:18.165
My god, you're crazy.

38:20.468 --> 38:21.601
I stopped, told you.

38:21.634 --> 38:22.870
It's out of your system.

38:23.770 --> 38:25.306
No.

38:25.339 --> 38:26.240
Why?

38:26.273 --> 38:27.707
Why did you do this?

38:28.943 --> 38:30.377
It was too easy for you.

38:42.689 --> 38:43.491
I feel fine.

38:43.524 --> 38:44.592
I'm just gonna go home.

38:46.227 --> 38:47.061
Hold on.

38:50.531 --> 38:51.899
I don't think you
should drive, okay?

38:51.932 --> 38:52.900
Pulse is fast.

38:54.869 --> 38:56.036
I'm gonna take
you to a hospital.

38:56.070 --> 38:59.440
You're not gonna take
me to the hospital.

39:00.374 --> 39:01.408
What are you gonna say?

39:01.442 --> 39:02.309
The truth.

39:02.343 --> 39:03.611
And get arrested?

39:04.979 --> 39:05.946
Is that what you want?

39:07.815 --> 39:08.648
No.

39:09.817 --> 39:11.051
No.

39:11.085 --> 39:12.652
No, no, no, no, no.

39:13.720 --> 39:14.555
I'll be fine.

39:24.431 --> 39:25.232
Lila.

39:25.266 --> 39:27.134
I'll clean your shirt.

39:32.940 --> 39:35.042
I don't know.

39:35.075 --> 39:36.743
Yeah, no I don't
want you to come up

39:36.776 --> 39:38.445
because then if it's
the flu or something

39:38.479 --> 39:39.647
then you guys get sick.

39:40.881 --> 39:42.383
I'm just gonna rest up

39:43.851 --> 39:46.053
and when I feel solid
I'll make my way home.

39:46.954 --> 39:47.787
Me too.

39:49.523 --> 39:50.958
Okay, give him a kiss for me.

39:52.927 --> 39:53.760
Bye.

39:58.499 --> 40:00.568
Are you gonna tell her?

40:02.002 --> 40:05.105
Well, she's already
scared that you're gonna

40:05.139 --> 40:06.574
murder her in her sleep.

40:07.474 --> 40:09.877
No, I want her to be awake.

40:11.946 --> 40:12.779
A joke.

40:15.950 --> 40:18.052
We still need a
new screen door?

40:18.085 --> 40:19.086
It doesn't matter.

40:21.255 --> 40:22.523
Unless the bugs fly in.

40:28.696 --> 40:30.197
It's a good house.

40:31.599 --> 40:32.433
Yeah.

40:35.469 --> 40:36.937
Is it okay if I fall asleep?

40:38.539 --> 40:40.274
No, not yet.

40:48.816 --> 40:49.782
Can I see him?

41:25.252 --> 41:27.755
I need you to get a
truck here by Saturday.

41:27.787 --> 41:29.456
What's the big rush?

41:29.490 --> 41:32.159
Just, we need to do this
before the girls get home.

41:33.327 --> 41:34.828
I just want this
place intact, so.

41:35.963 --> 41:37.131
I can pack your stuff.

41:42.870 --> 41:46.674
I'll try to get a truck
here by the weekend.

42:01.822 --> 42:02.856
Hi, this is Edgar.

42:02.890 --> 42:04.425
I'm not here but
leave a message.

42:04.458 --> 42:06.360
It's me,
confirming the truck

42:06.393 --> 42:08.062
is all set for tomorrow.

42:08.095 --> 42:10.230
So let me know what
time you'll be there.

42:14.301 --> 42:15.269
Hi, this is Edgar.

42:15.302 --> 42:16.537
I'm not here but
leave a message.

42:17.571 --> 42:18.807
Are you coming today?

42:18.839 --> 42:20.507
I'd like to start
painting up there.

42:25.012 --> 42:25.979
Hi, this is Edgar.

42:26.013 --> 42:28.582
I'm not here but
leave a message.

42:28.615 --> 42:30.117
Edgar, it's me again.

42:31.652 --> 42:34.254
You said you were gonna
have a truck here yesterday.

42:35.589 --> 42:36.957
You need to call me back.

43:07.654 --> 43:08.489
Try it.

43:09.790 --> 43:10.924
Go on.

43:10.958 --> 43:12.326
What, no?

43:12.359 --> 43:13.193
Okay.

43:16.397 --> 43:17.297
My yarns.

43:22.302 --> 43:23.137
Stop it.

43:27.274 --> 43:28.108
You're done.

43:31.011 --> 43:32.881
Yeah so we've been
talking about getting a place.

43:32.913 --> 43:34.448
If we could save up
enough money, you know,

43:34.481 --> 43:36.517
we were thinking about
getting a piece of property

43:36.550 --> 43:38.018
up in Maine.

43:38.051 --> 43:40.754
Maybe grow some Shiitake
mushrooms and raspberries.

43:40.788 --> 43:41.688
What?

43:41.722 --> 43:42.423
Okay I'm just gonna shut up.

43:42.456 --> 43:43.290
No.

43:44.658 --> 43:46.126
Careful, I have to ship that.

43:48.562 --> 43:50.197
Is this Catholic?

43:50.230 --> 43:51.932
Russian Orthodox.

43:51.965 --> 43:54.101
I contorted for Edgar's parents.

43:55.502 --> 43:57.204
I'm a Pantheist.

43:57.237 --> 43:59.540
So you believe in everything.

43:59.573 --> 44:00.407
Everything.

44:02.042 --> 44:03.110
Oh, that sounds
like a lot of work.

44:03.143 --> 44:05.979
I have trouble
believing in one thing.

44:06.013 --> 44:07.047
See I think it would
be hard to believe

44:07.080 --> 44:08.582
in just one thing.

44:08.615 --> 44:10.784
I mean how do you know
what that one thing is?

44:10.819 --> 44:13.320
Whatever stops
you from killing yourself.

44:15.589 --> 44:17.791
You think about
killing yourself?

44:17.826 --> 44:21.061
I think everybody thinks
about killing themselves.

44:23.230 --> 44:24.833
That kind of pain isn't special?

44:26.166 --> 44:28.101
My mother killed
herself when I was eight.

44:31.772 --> 44:32.739
How?

44:32.773 --> 44:34.641
She immolated herself

44:34.675 --> 44:36.143
on a rock in the
middle of a creek

44:36.176 --> 44:37.846
so the woods
wouldn't catch fire.

44:38.947 --> 44:40.547
It was by this
Buddhist monastery.

44:42.082 --> 44:43.684
I mean she wasn't even Buddhist.

44:45.986 --> 44:47.287
She wrote a note
about what to do

44:47.321 --> 44:48.890
with her books and her clothes.

44:50.524 --> 44:51.692
But she didn't say why.

44:53.794 --> 44:54.795
You must hate her.

44:55.696 --> 44:57.064
Why would I hate her?

44:58.565 --> 44:59.600
For leaving you.

45:00.667 --> 45:02.169
I don't really remember her.

45:04.037 --> 45:04.873
Just her voice.

45:09.811 --> 45:12.145
Sam doesn't remember
her mom either.

45:12.179 --> 45:13.280
How old was she?

45:13.313 --> 45:14.147
She was five.

45:16.583 --> 45:19.086
She was my best
friend from college.

45:19.119 --> 45:20.822
This was Maddie?

45:20.855 --> 45:23.190
Do you remember anything
from when you were five?

45:25.626 --> 45:28.529
See I remember when
I was four, vividly,

45:30.197 --> 45:32.199
burning my hands
trying to make tea.

45:34.368 --> 45:35.736
I remember a dog.

45:37.005 --> 45:38.006
I think it was,

45:39.908 --> 45:40.909
I was six.

45:41.876 --> 45:44.545
I was being a real asshole to it

45:45.479 --> 45:46.814
and it bit me.

45:48.348 --> 45:49.884
Right here, actually.

45:52.820 --> 45:54.788
I just, I remember at first

45:54.822 --> 45:57.057
I was really scared and angry.

45:58.225 --> 46:02.195
But then I was just
sad it didn't like me.

46:09.003 --> 46:10.237
You have a tick.

46:12.139 --> 46:12.974
What?

46:30.457 --> 46:31.291
Okay.

46:37.431 --> 46:38.332
Hold still.

46:58.853 --> 47:02.556
You should take
some antibiotics.

47:06.693 --> 47:08.195
Don't laugh at me.

48:11.191 --> 48:14.695
I used to take Sam back
here when she was little.

48:14.728 --> 48:18.900
And once we cut to the
woods from the house

48:18.933 --> 48:21.069
and got completely lost.

48:24.237 --> 48:26.841
I pretended that I knew
where I was going but

48:28.475 --> 48:31.278
still made Sam go up
the hill to find a view

48:31.311 --> 48:33.213
but I had no idea.

48:33.246 --> 48:34.648
How'd you get back?

48:35.983 --> 48:38.920
We heard dogs
barking and we found the road.

48:40.054 --> 48:41.521
But I still don't
know if Sam knew

48:41.555 --> 48:43.390
she was lost or not.

48:46.393 --> 48:47.260
I think
it's gonna rain.

48:48.295 --> 48:49.496
See, you gotta move.

48:52.066 --> 48:53.067
Move where?

48:54.534 --> 48:56.137
Anywhere.

48:56.170 --> 48:57.205
Move next door.

48:58.271 --> 48:59.706
Go get lost in this mountain.

49:01.341 --> 49:02.309
Just run away.

49:04.344 --> 49:06.480
Children get to run away.

49:06.513 --> 49:07.882
Not parents.

49:09.050 --> 49:11.418
So what do you do
if you can't run away?

49:13.687 --> 49:15.255
I tried to poison Edgar.

49:18.059 --> 49:18.893
Why?

49:22.529 --> 49:23.730
I don't know, I think,

49:25.166 --> 49:27.300
where there's love, there's
a potential for violence.

49:30.071 --> 49:31.973
Poison isn't violent.

49:32.006 --> 49:32.840
On the inside.

49:34.341 --> 49:36.643
You ever think
about poisoning me?

49:36.676 --> 49:38.146
No.

49:38.179 --> 49:41.015
No, poison is for liars.

49:41.048 --> 49:42.884
And you haven't lied
to me, have you?

50:10.744 --> 50:12.146
Where's my phone?

50:14.182 --> 50:15.016
Jonah.

50:30.797 --> 50:32.266
Edgar?

50:32.300 --> 50:33.733
Who the hell is
in the fucking driveway?

50:33.767 --> 50:35.335
I can't pull up.

50:35.368 --> 50:36.403
All right, yeah.

50:36.436 --> 50:38.806
Just wait one minute.

50:38.840 --> 50:40.241
I'll be down to deal with it.

50:41.943 --> 50:43.443
Edgar's here with the truck.

50:43.476 --> 50:45.213
I don't think your
clothes will be dry.

50:45.246 --> 50:48.381
So here, take this,

50:48.415 --> 50:49.616
and I'll call you later.

50:53.988 --> 50:55.622
Why don't I just
stay and help?

50:57.091 --> 50:57.825
No.

50:58.960 --> 51:00.127
Well I can
just hang out back here.

51:00.161 --> 51:02.830
No, I really, I just
need you to leave.

51:02.864 --> 51:03.630
You can come back later.

51:03.663 --> 51:05.099
Wait, what?

51:05.132 --> 51:06.167
No, this just really
isn't any of his business.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.467
Are you embarrassed of me?

51:07.500 --> 51:08.803
I didn't say that.

51:08.836 --> 51:09.971
So I'm
not important enough

51:10.004 --> 51:11.205
- to be his business?
- You need me

51:11.239 --> 51:12.940
to tell you that
you're important?

51:14.175 --> 51:15.609
Yeah?

51:15.642 --> 51:16.476
No.

51:17.510 --> 51:19.446
You're not important to me.

51:19.479 --> 51:21.315
And I'm not important to you.

51:21.349 --> 51:24.417
Here.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.754
You need to get up
and you need to go.

51:27.787 --> 51:28.923
No.

51:28.956 --> 51:29.756
What do you mean no?

51:29.789 --> 51:31.192
No.

51:31.225 --> 51:32.425
I don't just let people
throw me away like I'm trash.

51:32.459 --> 51:33.693
This isn't your house.

51:33.727 --> 51:34.628
Clearly it's his.

51:34.661 --> 51:36.663
No, it's my house.

51:36.696 --> 51:37.932
My house.

51:37.965 --> 51:39.333
Get out.

51:39.367 --> 51:40.600
Get out!

51:40.634 --> 51:42.203
What's wrong with you?

51:42.236 --> 51:43.804
There's nothing wrong with me.

51:45.873 --> 51:47.108
You don't tell Sam!

52:10.430 --> 52:11.933
Come on.

52:47.902 --> 52:48.702
Lila!

52:53.174 --> 52:53.975
Lila!

53:11.258 --> 53:12.093
Lila?

53:17.131 --> 53:18.332
What are you doing here?

53:18.366 --> 53:19.766
You were supposed to
be here yesterday.

53:19.799 --> 53:20.935
Well I called you
three times this morning.

53:21.869 --> 53:23.270
I turned my cellphone off.

53:23.304 --> 53:25.106
Where is my table upstairs?

53:25.139 --> 53:26.040
At the landfill.

53:27.774 --> 53:29.477
I told you, I had to paint.

53:32.013 --> 53:33.147
I thought you said you
didn't want anything.

53:33.180 --> 53:34.748
I said I didn't need anything.

53:34.781 --> 53:37.485
Need and want are
two different things.

53:37.517 --> 53:38.819
I'm gonna take that table.

53:40.254 --> 53:41.389
Fine.

53:41.422 --> 53:42.056
You can have
your little friend

53:42.089 --> 53:42.756
build you a new one.

53:45.226 --> 53:47.361
I need a screwdriver.

53:47.395 --> 53:48.229
You know where they are.

54:03.911 --> 54:07.148
Is this the only
screwdriver we have?

54:15.256 --> 54:18.993
You don't need a
screwdriver, they screw out.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.103
He can't build one
as simple as this.

54:33.307 --> 54:36.210
The screwdriver's
mine, by the way.

55:41.041 --> 55:41.842
Is it you?

55:41.876 --> 55:43.043
It's me.

55:43.077 --> 55:43.978
All right, so

55:44.011 --> 55:45.179
they said I had to play bottom

55:45.212 --> 55:46.480
and I didn't want to at first

55:46.514 --> 55:49.850
but it turned out
to be totally great.

55:49.884 --> 55:50.750
Oh sorry.

55:50.783 --> 55:52.620
That's okay.

55:57.925 --> 55:58.993
Huh.

56:09.870 --> 56:10.703
What?

56:13.274 --> 56:14.108
Please?

56:16.944 --> 56:18.045
Dara.

56:18.078 --> 56:18.913
Dara.

56:30.457 --> 56:31.791
Does Sam know?

56:32.860 --> 56:33.961
Yeah.

56:33.994 --> 56:35.029
I told her yesterday
on the phone.

56:36.130 --> 56:36.931
Charlotte?

56:37.831 --> 56:38.999
No.

56:39.033 --> 56:40.501
But Gigi does?

56:40.534 --> 56:41.435
Yes.

56:41.468 --> 56:42.503
That means Charlotte knows.

56:43.537 --> 56:44.905
I don't want a brother.

56:46.640 --> 56:47.508
Well you
don't have to meet him

56:47.541 --> 56:48.509
until you're ready.

56:57.717 --> 56:59.752
You know we're still
parents and friends

56:59.786 --> 57:02.423
but we just won't
be married anymore.

57:03.756 --> 57:06.961
I don't think you
should be friends.

57:06.994 --> 57:08.596
Why not?

57:08.629 --> 57:10.598
'Cause it'll just
make mom sad again.

57:14.201 --> 57:15.302
Where do you live now?

57:19.473 --> 57:20.307
Brooklyn.

57:28.282 --> 57:29.250
See you tomorrow?

57:33.988 --> 57:34.888
You're just gonna give me

57:34.922 --> 57:35.956
handfuls of cash from now on?

57:37.458 --> 57:38.292
Yeah.

57:41.028 --> 57:41.862
See you.

57:54.375 --> 57:55.542
I need a napkin.

58:05.619 --> 58:06.654
I said I wanted a napkin,

58:06.687 --> 58:07.855
not a paper towel.

58:09.323 --> 58:11.625
A paper
towel can be a napkin.

58:11.659 --> 58:12.826
Yeah.

58:12.860 --> 58:13.661
But it's not.

58:15.629 --> 58:16.897
I'm not even hungry.

58:21.502 --> 58:23.504
Well, you can just
clean the dishes.

58:23.537 --> 58:24.772
I didn't even eat.

58:25.906 --> 58:27.608
Well, you
still have to help.

58:29.009 --> 58:30.611
I wanna stay at dad's tonight.

58:31.745 --> 58:33.347
You're staying
with him next week.

58:34.848 --> 58:36.750
I don't wanna
stay here with you.

58:36.784 --> 58:37.685
Why?

58:37.718 --> 58:39.219
You smell like cigarettes.

58:39.253 --> 58:41.388
Well he doesn't have a bed
set up for you yet, Dara.

58:42.656 --> 58:44.391
All right Dara, just
leave the phone alone.

58:45.859 --> 58:47.528
So are you gonna
kill yourself?

58:49.330 --> 58:50.164
What?

58:52.399 --> 58:53.901
The last time he left,

58:53.934 --> 58:55.602
Dad came back because you
were gonna kill yourself.

59:07.181 --> 59:11.051
I was very, very
sad for a while.

59:13.587 --> 59:16.924
Your dad came back because we
both wanted it to work out.

59:16.957 --> 59:17.791
But not now.

59:20.594 --> 59:23.497
Well now it's gonna work
out in a different way,

59:23.530 --> 59:24.798
your Dad not living here.

59:25.966 --> 59:28.469
And Gem and the baby
is part of our lives.

59:34.742 --> 59:35.776
Just don't go away.

59:38.813 --> 59:40.047
Now when you
were a little baby

59:40.080 --> 59:44.451
you used to dance all
night, sleep all day.

59:46.787 --> 59:49.423
And I remember holding
you up like a doll

59:49.456 --> 59:50.557
and we'd dance.

59:54.728 --> 59:57.965
You would lie down and
sleep for 10 minutes.

01:00:00.869 --> 01:00:02.871
And I remember lying
there thinking that

01:00:04.972 --> 01:00:06.740
just a small movement of the sun

01:00:06.774 --> 01:00:09.710
is the only thing that
differentiates night from day.

01:00:10.744 --> 01:00:11.645
Mom, stop talking.

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:24.658
We got one walker.

01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:27.928
I think a walker and four nits.

01:00:34.268 --> 01:00:35.469
Can I see?

01:00:35.502 --> 01:00:36.303
Yeah.

01:00:43.076 --> 01:00:44.913
No lice for me.

01:00:44.945 --> 01:00:46.413
I have to do you next, Dara.

01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:48.615
I don't have lice.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.619
Come on, you were
at the same camp.

01:00:52.653 --> 01:00:54.087
Yeah.

01:00:54.121 --> 01:00:55.589
But we don't hang out anymore.

01:00:59.493 --> 01:01:02.062
Mom, this is really
awkward and lame.

01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:04.498
What happened?

01:01:04.531 --> 01:01:05.732
Nothing happened.

01:01:05.766 --> 01:01:07.568
We just don't hang
out anymore, right?

01:01:07.601 --> 01:01:10.537
We don't need
to make them do this.

01:01:10.571 --> 01:01:11.538
Why don't you want to hang out

01:01:11.572 --> 01:01:12.773
with Charlotte anymore?

01:01:12.807 --> 01:01:14.441
She doesn't wanna
hang out with me.

01:01:14.475 --> 01:01:15.642
Why?

01:01:15.676 --> 01:01:18.045
Because we were
playing proof or dare

01:01:18.078 --> 01:01:19.780
and I told Benjie and Yelena

01:01:19.814 --> 01:01:21.181
that Charlotte liked Darryl.

01:01:21.215 --> 01:01:22.082
I don't.

01:01:22.115 --> 01:01:23.283
You said you did.

01:01:23.317 --> 01:01:24.451
I said he was cute.

01:01:24.485 --> 01:01:25.887
Is that all you said?

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.254
I tried to sit with you

01:01:27.287 --> 01:01:29.223
but you said there was
already someone sitting there.

01:01:29.256 --> 01:01:30.557
It was just an empty chair.

01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:31.792
I told you.

01:01:31.826 --> 01:01:33.293
Our invisible rodent
was sitting there.

01:01:33.327 --> 01:01:35.629
I'm more important
than an invisible rodent.

01:01:40.133 --> 01:01:40.969
Hey.

01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:44.137
How's your sister?

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:46.640
She went home.

01:01:46.673 --> 01:01:47.474
My god.

01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:50.879
It was the drumming.

01:01:50.912 --> 01:01:52.579
Shut up, she
loved the drumming.

01:01:59.086 --> 01:02:00.287
Anybody home?

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.022
You're here!

01:02:02.055 --> 01:02:02.891
- Oh.
- Hi.

01:02:05.325 --> 01:02:06.693
Ossie wants to come in.

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:12.099
Wow,
look at this place.

01:02:14.368 --> 01:02:15.736
I can't believe how
much you got done.

01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:20.774
Mom, you
didn't have to do this.

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:25.712
I should have done
it a lot sooner.

01:02:31.518 --> 01:02:33.186
These were Maddie's.

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:35.890
Sam's baby clothes.

01:02:35.924 --> 01:02:37.825
Oh my god.

01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:39.092
Did you ever see these?

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:44.899
Is that Maddie?

01:02:44.933 --> 01:02:45.766
Yeah.

01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:47.869
She had a sailboat?

01:02:47.902 --> 01:02:49.037
She had
it over the summer.

01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:57.011
You look just like her.

01:02:58.913 --> 01:03:01.348
First thing that your mother
told me after you were born

01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:03.283
is that your eyes
were like the ocean.

01:03:06.921 --> 01:03:07.989
I didn't know that.

01:03:09.456 --> 01:03:12.192
Well I didn't remember
until I started cleaning.

01:03:14.728 --> 01:03:17.331
I dreamed she was
on the boat with me.

01:03:17.364 --> 01:03:18.967
I didn't talk to her.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.069
She always had her back to me.

01:03:21.101 --> 01:03:23.004
She was doing all
the technical stuff

01:03:23.037 --> 01:03:26.139
like tying knots and
taking in the sail.

01:03:26.173 --> 01:03:27.474
She was really good at it.

01:03:28.876 --> 01:03:30.945
I just want you to know
that this room is here

01:03:30.979 --> 01:03:31.946
for you and Emmi.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:32.814
If you want.

01:03:34.015 --> 01:03:35.248
You don't have to
stay here for me.

01:03:35.282 --> 01:03:36.249
No.

01:03:36.283 --> 01:03:37.952
I wanna be here, Mom.

01:03:37.986 --> 01:03:38.820
I wanna be home.

01:03:41.022 --> 01:03:42.122
You should tell her.

01:03:43.423 --> 01:03:44.257
Tell me what?

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:48.495
We bought a food truck.

01:03:50.464 --> 01:03:51.531
A food truck?

01:03:51.565 --> 01:03:52.466
- Yeah.
- Emmi bought it.

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:53.700
Yeah.

01:03:53.734 --> 01:03:55.235
And we're gonna
rebuild it together.

01:03:55.268 --> 01:03:57.638
I wouldn't start taking it
out until the spring, but,

01:03:57.671 --> 01:03:58.873
Where would you go?

01:03:58.906 --> 01:04:00.808
Local, we'd take
it out locally.

01:04:00.842 --> 01:04:02.110
And if you need me here more

01:04:02.142 --> 01:04:04.411
- then we can wait.
- Hey Lila, here.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.627
Sam, we should talk.

01:04:21.795 --> 01:04:22.997
I don't
wanna talk to you.

01:04:24.765 --> 01:04:25.766
It's okay.

01:04:28.036 --> 01:04:33.041
I'll go.

01:04:51.926 --> 01:04:53.161
Ooh, nice spin.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.275
I'll take over.

01:05:09.276 --> 01:05:10.677
Find the other one?

01:05:13.714 --> 01:05:14.781
Champion ping pong.

01:05:14.816 --> 01:05:15.682
Playing?

01:05:23.891 --> 01:05:25.093
Sam like her new room?

01:05:26.027 --> 01:05:28.029
Yeah, she does.

01:05:32.499 --> 01:05:34.267
When do you think she
might talk to me again?

01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:35.335
I don't know.

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.443
When she needs money?

01:05:43.477 --> 01:05:44.377
Do you have any?

01:05:47.148 --> 01:05:47.982
You're funny.

01:05:57.225 --> 01:05:58.159
Whoa, whoa.

01:05:59.326 --> 01:06:01.229
I forgot how good
you are at this.

01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:02.230
No.

01:06:02.262 --> 01:06:03.097
Wait, one more.

01:06:04.832 --> 01:06:05.665
Oh!

01:06:07.034 --> 01:06:09.536
What, where you going?

01:06:09.569 --> 01:06:10.704
It's too hot.

01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:13.473
I gotta get changed.

01:06:37.497 --> 01:06:39.366
I remember that dress.

01:06:39.399 --> 01:06:40.835
Dara said I should wear it.

01:06:43.637 --> 01:06:45.139
Can you button it?

01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:13.194
When I open my eyes
first thing in the morning

01:08:13.227 --> 01:08:15.062
I still expect to see you.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.752
Jake.

01:09:17.724 --> 01:09:18.826
Jake.

01:09:18.859 --> 01:09:20.027
What?

01:09:21.162 --> 01:09:23.296
Enough, gimme the phone.

01:09:23.331 --> 01:09:25.465
No, I'm in the middle
of a conversation.

01:09:25.497 --> 01:09:27.435
You need to learn to
be in a conversation

01:09:27.466 --> 01:09:29.769
with the people you
are actually with.

01:09:29.804 --> 01:09:31.005
Why, I don't
have anything to say

01:09:31.037 --> 01:09:31.939
to any of you.

01:09:31.973 --> 01:09:33.174
Then just hang out.

01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:35.209
And braid
hair, no thanks.

01:09:40.081 --> 01:09:42.615
Give me the phone
or it goes away for good.

01:10:30.231 --> 01:10:31.032
Hello.

01:10:31.899 --> 01:10:32.699
Hey.

01:10:32.732 --> 01:10:34.101
Hey.

01:10:34.135 --> 01:10:35.302
You going hiking?

01:10:35.336 --> 01:10:36.904
He's going up South Mountain.

01:10:36.937 --> 01:10:38.139
We're trying to
talk him out of it.

01:10:38.172 --> 01:10:40.207
I hear there's
a beautiful view.

01:10:40.241 --> 01:10:41.708
If you could find it.

01:10:43.511 --> 01:10:44.311
It's fun.

01:10:44.345 --> 01:10:45.179
You should come.

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.081
No thanks.

01:10:48.382 --> 01:10:50.484
Sam and Emmi can't come.

01:10:50.518 --> 01:10:51.452
'Cause we
have a life here.

01:10:51.485 --> 01:10:52.453
Yes we do.

01:10:55.523 --> 01:10:56.556
Call us if you get lost.

01:10:56.589 --> 01:10:57.925
Yeah, okay.

01:11:14.141 --> 01:11:15.708
Yeah it's fine.

01:11:15.742 --> 01:11:17.011
Just go up in the driveway.

01:11:17.044 --> 01:11:19.113
Maybe the girls will
wanna see the baby.

01:11:31.791 --> 01:11:34.128
This is weird,
you should talk to her.

01:11:41.734 --> 01:11:43.104
You know, he told us.

01:11:46.474 --> 01:11:48.109
I'm sorry.

01:11:48.142 --> 01:11:50.010
I don't want
you to apologize.

01:11:50.945 --> 01:11:52.645
What do you want?

01:11:52.679 --> 01:11:54.081
I want you to
act like my mother.

01:12:42.729 --> 01:12:44.731
Did you
think I was dead?

01:12:44.764 --> 01:12:46.766
No, you can't die.

01:12:47.935 --> 01:12:50.404
It's impossible, you'd
take this fun away.

01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:57.378
What angel wakes me
from my flowery bed.

01:13:11.292 --> 01:13:15.728
Pray thee speak
again, sweet mortal.

01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:20.834
Mine ear is much
enamored to thy note,

01:13:21.936 --> 01:13:24.638
such as mine eye
enamored to thy shape.

01:13:26.507 --> 01:13:30.277
And thy gentle force
perforth do move me

01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:33.746
on my first view to say

01:13:36.584 --> 01:13:37.451
I love thee.

01:13:56.637 --> 01:13:58.339
You have to inhale.

01:14:02.009 --> 01:14:03.477
Inhale.

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:04.645
Here, I'll show you.

01:14:13.687 --> 01:14:15.122
Dara, I gotta go.

01:14:24.164 --> 01:14:26.000
Come see your brother.

01:14:48.489 --> 01:14:51.492
All right,
am I getting it?

01:14:58.699 --> 01:15:00.868
Yeah, you got it.

01:15:03.437 --> 01:15:04.238
I can't get my hands...

01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:05.105
You got it.

01:15:10.544 --> 01:15:11.378
Sam?

01:15:12.279 --> 01:15:13.280
Where are you going?

01:15:14.882 --> 01:15:16.150
I'm going to Emmi's.

01:15:18.519 --> 01:15:19.753
I don't want you to leave.

01:15:21.188 --> 01:15:23.490
Mom, you don't need me
here to take care of you.

01:15:24.425 --> 01:15:25.259
Yes I do.

01:15:34.435 --> 01:15:37.971
And you keep leaving

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.674
and leaving.

01:15:42.976 --> 01:15:44.578
And I'll be back.

01:15:46.113 --> 01:15:47.448
I know.

01:16:27.354 --> 01:16:30.891
You know this baby's
gonna be 25 when you're 75?

01:16:30.924 --> 01:16:32.659
Which is why he's
gonna need you.

01:16:41.702 --> 01:16:43.036
I got him.

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:47.641
I know.

01:16:47.674 --> 01:16:48.509
He's okay.

01:16:49.543 --> 01:16:50.944
Shh, shh, shh.

01:16:50.978 --> 01:16:54.915
There you go.

01:16:54.948 --> 01:16:57.217
Fast asleep in sister's arms.

01:16:58.853 --> 01:17:01.422
- Yeah.
- So cute.

01:17:01.455 --> 01:17:02.956
That was you.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.991
Aw.

01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:11.532
Okay, okay, okay.

01:17:11.565 --> 01:17:12.966
Okay, okay, okay.

01:18:29.944 --> 01:18:30.777
Mom?

01:19:06.446 --> 01:19:07.949
How many?

01:19:10.284 --> 01:19:11.118
13.
