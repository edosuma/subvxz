Free the innocent.
Find the guilty.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.683
- Are you sure you want to poke the bear?
- I want to rip his heart out.

Previously on Proven Innocent...

00:20.054 --> 00:21.389
What's Sparrow Ridge, Heather?

00:23.524 --> 00:25.359
Do you think that any
of those other girls

00:25.393 --> 00:26.403
could have killed Rosemary?

00:26.427 --> 00:28.662
- It's not impossible.
- Bodie...

00:28.696 --> 00:30.331
meet Nathan.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.008
It's why I've been afraid
to give this a real shot.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.401
You still want to do this?

00:33.434 --> 00:34.702
Without the murder weapon,

00:34.735 --> 00:37.238
any new case against
Madeline Scott is a nonstarter.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.907
I've considered
dredging Quarry Lake.

00:39.940 --> 00:43.043
If you don't find anything,
you'll be crucified.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.079
You can forget
about becoming A.G.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.047
Dredge the lake.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.536
The drones have covered 76%
of the floor of the cove.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.704
We've discovered 11 potential
murder weapons.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.107
- Make that 12.
- Men and their toys.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.543
Is all this really necessary?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.378
Drones are more discreet
than divers.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.780
And ten times more expensive.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.715
Isabel, would you mind?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.584
Of course.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.887
I would appreciate it
if you would not discuss

01:26.920 --> 01:28.389
the finances for this expedition

01:28.422 --> 01:30.057
in front of any
of the employees.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.626
Don't worry, Gore. They already
know you're violating

01:32.660 --> 01:34.962
a dozen campaign laws
to pay for this.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.264
I have to keep it off the books

01:36.297 --> 01:37.765
so I can keep it
out of the press.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.075
I'm gonna find
the murder weapon.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.401
I'm gonna make an arrest.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.903
And not a single person
on the entire planet

01:42.936 --> 01:44.738
will care
where the money came from.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.250
But if you don't find
the murder weapon,

01:46.274 --> 01:47.417
and the disclosures
are made public,

01:47.441 --> 01:48.642
you're in a lot of trouble.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.644
Madeline Scott is guilty.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.247
I will go to my grave
proving it.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.450
And your grave might
just be a prison cell.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.295
God, you're my hero.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.340
"Good morning, brother.
Thanks for waking up so early

02:10.364 --> 02:12.442
- "and bringing me my coffee."
- Are these my muffins?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.768
"And muffins." Yeah.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.937
So I matched the initials
to a bunch of girls

02:16.970 --> 02:18.606
who went to our high school.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.841
All of them seem like the type
that would be involved

02:20.874 --> 02:22.276
in something strange like this,

02:22.310 --> 02:24.278
but there's a few
I couldn't match.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.114
Okay, "JS," that's gonna be,
Julie Selewicz,

02:27.147 --> 02:29.617
um, which would make that
Elaine Sweeney,

02:29.650 --> 02:32.986
Lisa Guzman and Lisa Harrington.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.299
How do you know all that? -'Cause
they were part of the cool crowd

02:35.323 --> 02:37.625
at Sacred Heart, and I had
a thing for Catholic girls

02:37.658 --> 02:39.627
- back in the day.
- Don't tell me you hooked up

02:39.660 --> 02:41.161
with all the girls
at Sacred Heart.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.365
No, no, not all of them,
just... most of them.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.706
- I'm serious, get going. I got it.
- I'm going.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.984
You're getting really good
at this.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.379
- Feed Atticus.
- Gotcha.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.015
I was the leading expert

03:02.049 --> 03:04.017
on shaken baby syndrome
in Cook County.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.487
I testified
in hundreds of cases.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.322
We believed a triad of symptoms,

03:08.356 --> 03:10.724
when manifested in isolation,

03:10.758 --> 03:13.327
could only be caused
by a caretaker

03:13.361 --> 03:14.995
shaking a baby to death.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.497
But now we know that the triad

03:16.530 --> 03:18.666
can be caused
by undiagnosed illnesses,

03:18.699 --> 03:21.369
head trauma or a combination.

03:21.402 --> 03:25.205
There are a lot of people in
prison who shouldn't be there.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.175
That's a lot
of wrongful convictions.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.677
It's our worst nightmare.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.879
It's a nightmare my sister's
been living for ten years.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.414
She was convicted of shaking

03:33.447 --> 03:34.891
- her baby to death.
- Amelia Vandenhey.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.751
Six months old. Her mother,
Gabrielle, was alone with her

03:37.785 --> 03:41.689
the same day the medical
examiner said she was injured.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.357
Gabrielle was also diagnosed

03:43.391 --> 03:44.534
with severe
postpartum depression.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.027
Which the prosecution twisted
to make her look

03:47.060 --> 03:48.529
like a homicidal maniac.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.897
Gabrielle knew
she was depressed.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.865
It made her
the most careful mother.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.702
She loved Amelia. She just h-had
a hard time showing it.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.905
Shaken baby cases have some
of the highest conviction rates.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.708
You convince a jury that
a defendant is a bad mother,

04:00.741 --> 04:03.043
most of the time, the
prosecution can just paper over

04:03.076 --> 04:05.255
- any lack of physical evidence.
- But what really convicted her

04:05.279 --> 04:07.214
was the medical examiner's
testimony.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.917
He said the only possible
cause of death was shaking.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.419
Who was the M.E.?

04:11.452 --> 04:12.920
He was.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.591
Amelia hadn't cried for hours.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.059
I thought it was the first time

04:19.091 --> 04:22.563
that she had slept
through the night.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.133
But when I checked on her,
she wasn't moving.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.404
And her skin was ice-cold.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.573
It was the worst moment
of my life.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.409
And then they said
that I did it.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.078
And everyone turned on me,
including my own husband.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.749
And I never even got a chance
to say goodbye to her.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.817
I'm so sorry, Gabrielle.

04:43.851 --> 04:47.087
I'm sorry that you went
through this, too.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.089
Thanks.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.924
The most damning moment
of your trial

04:50.958 --> 04:53.594
was when your mother-in-law
testified that you said

04:53.627 --> 04:55.596
you fantasized about
getting rid of your child.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.097
You know who she is, right?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.100
Deborah Vandenhey,
of the Chicago Vandenheys.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.268
Owners of one of the largest

05:01.301 --> 05:02.446
privately-owned banks
in the U.S.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.438
So you didn't say that?

05:04.472 --> 05:06.840
No, I did say it.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.876
And it's horrible.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.714
All I wanted...
I wanted to be a good mom.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.451
But Amelia...

05:17.485 --> 05:18.686
her crying...

05:20.488 --> 05:22.356
Her crying was like nails
on a chalkboard,

05:22.390 --> 05:24.291
and breastfeeding hurt.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.993
I didn't want to be around her.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.362
You didn't hurt her.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.498
I was afraid that I might.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.301
But I never did.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.669
I made sure of it.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.471
I took my meds.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.906
I saw my doctor.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.810
Tell us about the day
before Amelia died.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.812
Nothing...

05:44.845 --> 05:46.980
nothing happened.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.149
Literally, nothing.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.820
She slept, and I watched...

05:52.853 --> 05:54.522
and I watched her.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.527
I may not have known
how to connect to her,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.061
but I loved her.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.596
I didn't kill her.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.083
You're a new mother

06:23.116 --> 06:25.085
struggling
with postpartum depression,

06:25.118 --> 06:27.020
unable to bond with your baby

06:27.054 --> 06:29.356
the way you're expected to.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.560
Do you hide this feeling
and risk harming yourself

06:32.593 --> 06:34.061
and your baby?

06:34.094 --> 06:37.397
Or do you confide in someone
your dark secret

06:37.431 --> 06:39.199
and risk their scorn?

06:41.134 --> 06:44.438
If you're brave,
you do the right thing

06:44.472 --> 06:46.440
and open up
about your struggles.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.708
You make sure

06:47.741 --> 06:51.545
your baby is safe.

06:51.579 --> 06:55.115
But what happens if the baby
mysteriously dies,

06:55.148 --> 06:59.219
an overzealous prosecutor uses
your honesty against you,

06:59.252 --> 07:00.921
a doctor you don't even know

07:00.954 --> 07:03.624
testifies that science says
that you shook

07:03.657 --> 07:07.294
your baby to death?

07:08.328 --> 07:10.297
How do you go on?

07:10.330 --> 07:11.899
How do you keep from thinking

07:11.932 --> 07:14.635
that you should have
hidden your truth,

07:14.668 --> 07:19.272
pocketed it away
and just endured the pain?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.609
On this week's episode

07:21.642 --> 07:24.277
of Until Proven Innocent,
we'll discuss the case

07:24.311 --> 07:28.148
of Gabrielle Parcell,
a woman who told her truth,

07:28.181 --> 07:30.317
and she paid for her honesty.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.953
But now... she has

07:32.986 --> 07:34.454
the opportunity to fight back.

07:34.488 --> 07:37.290
Illnesses
like meningitis, hemophilia,

07:37.324 --> 07:40.594
even vitamin deficiencies,
mimic the signs of SBS.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.463
Common household accidents like
falling from a seated position

07:43.497 --> 07:46.099
can cause the type of head
trauma I observed in this case.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.001
In light of recent advancements

07:48.035 --> 07:50.771
in medical science,
in your expert opinion,

07:50.804 --> 07:53.607
what was the cause of death
of Amelia Vandenhey?

07:53.641 --> 07:56.009
Head trauma. But it's impossible
to know the cause of that

07:56.043 --> 07:57.344
without further testing.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.812
Thank you.

08:00.848 --> 08:04.351
Shaken baby syndrome is still
a legitimate diagnosis, correct?

08:04.384 --> 08:05.786
Objection.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.188
Shaken baby syndrome is an
accusation, not a diagnosis.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.357
- Sustained.
- I'll rephrase.

08:10.390 --> 08:14.361
In your expert opinion,
is it possible to shake

08:14.394 --> 08:16.530
- a baby to death?
- It is. But I would only

08:16.564 --> 08:18.298
determine that
to be the cause of death

08:18.331 --> 08:20.300
if I had excluded
everything else.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.536
And when Amelia's
tiny, cold corpse

08:22.570 --> 08:23.704
was on your examination...

08:23.737 --> 08:25.305
Objection! Inflammatory.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.141
Sustained. Ms. Moriarty,
I'm loath to agree

08:28.175 --> 08:30.711
with Ms. Scott and Mr. Boudreau,
but what are we doing here?

08:30.744 --> 08:33.145
There's no jury present.
Spare the theatrics.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.224
Theatrics are what these cases
are all about, Your Honor.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.985
That was not an invitation to
the peanut gallery, Ms. Scott.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.318
Zip it.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.888
There's a witness. Use him.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.157
Dr. Snyder,
you testified at trial

08:44.191 --> 08:46.226
that the only day
Amelia could have been injured

08:46.259 --> 08:48.228
was the day before she died,
didn't you?

08:48.261 --> 08:50.998
I did. But my expert opinion
has changed.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.666
Will it change again tomorrow?

08:52.700 --> 08:54.501
- Objection!
- I get the gist, Ms. Moriarty.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.079
But, counselors,
without a specific reason

08:56.103 --> 08:59.539
to believe there may have been
another cause of death,

08:59.573 --> 09:01.909
I'm not inclined to vacate
a murder conviction.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.878
But, Judge, we're merely seeking
access to the autopsy slides

09:04.912 --> 09:06.914
and tissue samples
so we can determine

09:06.947 --> 09:08.357
if something else
caused Amelia's death.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.183
Y-Your Honor, i-if I may.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.419
I just want to make sure
I didn't get it wrong.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.187
Fine.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.057
Motion to inspect
the scientific evidence granted.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.092
Court adjourned.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.264
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.066
Hiring a couple
of shyster lawyers

09:26.099 --> 09:27.601
to dredge up
these horrid memories

09:27.635 --> 09:29.436
of my poor granddaughter.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.905
Please, Deborah,
you don't care about Amelia.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.416
You don't care
about anyone but yourself.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.375
- Kirsten, that's not fair.
- Shut up, Clay.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.544
All right,
let's all just stay calm.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.212
Hi. I'm Madeline Scott.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.214
Easy Boudreau, shyster-at-law.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.918
You people are profiting off a
lunatic woman and her dead baby.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.720
She killed my granddaughter.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.623
What my mother is trying
to say is...

09:49.657 --> 09:51.458
Your family is trash.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.766
Classy.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.069
This is evidence
of a brain bleed.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.772
Ten years ago
I saw one brain bleed

10:04.805 --> 10:07.407
which started within 24 hours
before death.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.576
But with new medical advances,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.411
I can slice
the tissue samples thinner

10:11.444 --> 10:13.422
and see blood leveling
which shows this brain bleed

10:13.446 --> 10:16.249
- started earlier.
- So, the prosecution's theory

10:16.283 --> 10:18.986
- that Amelia was injured on Tuesday...
- Was wrong.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.164
Amelia could have been injured
up to five days earlier.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.790
When someone else was with her.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.792
Do you know what could have
caused the injury?

10:24.825 --> 10:27.427
I've ruled out most illnesses,
except one.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.597
If she had something called
factor XIII clotting disorder,

10:30.630 --> 10:33.767
much less force... like something
as simple as a fall

10:33.801 --> 10:36.269
on the floor...
Could have been fatal.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.838
Why didn't you bring
this up at trial?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.506
I saw the triad,
did a basic check

10:39.539 --> 10:42.843
for other medical problems...
I assumed it was shaken baby.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.644
And when the prosecutor
told me the mother

10:44.678 --> 10:48.515
had postpartum depression,
I got confirmation bias.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.684
Medical tunnel vision.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.353
Right. So, what now?

10:53.386 --> 10:55.355
I can run a blood
coagulation panel to determine

10:55.388 --> 10:57.958
if she had the disorder,
but I need blood samples

10:57.991 --> 10:59.326
from both parents.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.628
Well, mom's not gonna
be a problem, but...

11:01.661 --> 11:04.131
But the dad? Mama's boy?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.365
He just might be.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.802
So, if Amelia could die
from a random accident,

11:08.836 --> 11:11.038
there could be hundreds
of women in prison for shaking

11:11.071 --> 11:12.548
their babies, when really,
it was something

11:12.572 --> 11:14.474
as simple as a fall
on the floor.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.744
Sadly... yes.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.380
My God.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.692
If it was a disease,

11:32.726 --> 11:34.561
wouldn't they have
already discovered it?

11:34.594 --> 11:36.997
Once "SBS" was written
in Amelia's file,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.866
investigators stopped looking
for a disease

11:38.899 --> 11:40.333
and started looking
for a murderer.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.668
There's a chance your daughter

11:41.701 --> 11:42.846
died of a congenital
blood disorder.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.504
To know for sure,
we're gonna need

11:44.537 --> 11:45.672
a blood sample from you.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.341
You didn't see
how Gabrielle was acting.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.844
She wouldn't even
go near Amelia.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.212
Broke my heart.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.747
That was postpartum depression.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.582
It doesn't mean
she killed Amelia.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.221
You know, we just learned

12:01.254 --> 12:04.257
prosecution got
the timeline wrong.

12:04.291 --> 12:07.694
They could have got
a lot of things wrong.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.131
If it were my kid, I'd want to
know what really happened.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.037
Okay.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.106
Okay, I'll do the blood test.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.809
But for Amelia.
Not for Gabrielle.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.946
The whole Nathan thing
just kind of...

12:25.979 --> 12:28.882
- well, it surprised me.
- Yeah.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.226
You should have told me
about it earlier

12:30.250 --> 12:31.751
so I didn't
make a fool of myself.

12:33.453 --> 12:37.124
Well, I'm sorry.
But I'm new at this, too.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.725
But you told me you wanted
to get real.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.894
You know, Nathan's
a big part of my life,

12:40.928 --> 12:43.139
- and you want to be in my life, you got to know about Nathan.
- I do. I...

12:43.163 --> 12:45.265
I do. I'm crazy about you.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.400
But...?

12:47.434 --> 12:51.104
But-but nothing.
I'm just processing this.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.575
All right, okay.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.577
Well, you keep processing.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.913
I'm gonna take care of Nathan.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.314
What, you're leaving?

13:01.348 --> 13:04.918
- Yeah. I got to pick up the kid.
- Okay.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.920
Look, um...

13:06.954 --> 13:09.489
no hard feelings
if this is too much reality.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.758
We started off just having fun.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.494
So I get it if this is too deep.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.830
Thanks.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.099
That's actually
really cool of you.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.667
Yeah, well...

13:20.700 --> 13:23.003
you're basically
a man-child anyway,

13:23.036 --> 13:24.938
so it's probably
a really bad idea.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.706
Take care, Bodie.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.180
A man-child?

13:36.049 --> 13:38.018
All right, bad news.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.695
Clay tested negative
for the blood disorder,

13:39.719 --> 13:41.654
which means Amelia didn't die
of an illness.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.956
So something else happened.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.524
We just need to figure out what.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.835
I don't want to rain
on everyone's...

13:45.859 --> 13:47.127
innocence parade here,

13:47.160 --> 13:48.637
but it's not looking good
for our client.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.697
We don't know if there was
abuse, Bodie.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.866
All we know is that
Amelia was injured

13:52.900 --> 13:54.201
the week before she died.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.212
Right. And it could have been
Gabrielle who did it.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.038
She said she wanted
to get rid of the baby.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.040
Look at the M.E.'s report
a little bit closer.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.985
You'll see that there's a bruise
across Amelia's chest.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.376
It looks like a belt mark.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.145
That's evidence of abuse.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.646
Or it's evidence of an accident.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.548
Maybe an accident caused
both the chest bruise

14:08.581 --> 14:10.350
and the head trauma.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.885
A fall from as little
as one foot high

14:11.919 --> 14:13.320
can generate twice the force

14:13.353 --> 14:14.697
an adult can generate
shaking an infant.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.557
Yeah, but that leaves us
with an almost impossible task.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.526
How do we find out
if an infant fell

14:19.559 --> 14:20.894
ten years after the fact?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.896
We investigate.
We keep searching,

14:22.930 --> 14:24.597
but we don't give up.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.654
If this was an accident,
then this is my fault.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.823
- You can't think that way, Gabby.
- No...

15:56.856 --> 15:58.591
I was her mother.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.760
I was supposed
to-to protect her.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.430
Something happened to Amelia,
and I didn't know.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.931
I know this is difficult,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.475
but we need your help
if we're going to get

16:06.499 --> 16:08.299
to the bottom of this
and get you out of here.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.170
The medical examiner

16:10.203 --> 16:11.971
from your first trial now thinks

16:12.005 --> 16:13.506
that the injury
could have happened

16:13.540 --> 16:17.344
as many as five days
before Amelia's death.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.679
Do you remember any accidents?

16:19.712 --> 16:24.284
I was hazy on antidepressants,
so I stayed in my room a lot.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.286
The mother-in-law, Deborah,

16:26.319 --> 16:29.789
was taking care of her
quite a bit.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.324
Wait.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.393
What?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.463
There was a car accident.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.365
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. It was,

16:38.398 --> 16:40.200
four days before Amelia died.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.369
Clay was driving her
to a doctor's appointment

16:42.402 --> 16:43.879
- with Deborah.
- How bad was the accident?

16:43.903 --> 16:46.206
Clay said it wasn't bad at all,
but I-I remember that

16:46.239 --> 16:47.874
his car needed some body work.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.509
My attorney at trial

16:49.542 --> 16:52.212
told me that
that was irrelevant,

16:52.245 --> 16:54.765
'cause he said that the injuries
definitely happened on Tuesday.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.486
- Is it possible?
- Yes.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.488
It's very possible.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.022
It's a big lead.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.165
I seriously doubt

17:13.200 --> 17:15.268
Deborah Vandenhey
is gonna talk to us.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.003
Sure she will.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.173
Rich ladies understand
the power of a subpoena.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.075
Believe me, she'd rather answer

17:22.108 --> 17:23.910
our questions here
than in court.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.012
Wow.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.579
Nothing stands out

17:27.614 --> 17:29.849
about the week
before Amelia died.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.519
My son and I were
taking care of her.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.422
Unfortunately, her mother
was no help whatsoever.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.390
Well, we understand
that you and your son

17:37.424 --> 17:39.025
got into a car accident
with her.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.860
The fender bender?

17:40.893 --> 17:44.564
Amelia was strapped into
her rear-facing car seat.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.266
Nothing happened to her.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.101
She slept through
the whole thing.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.702
And you never
took her to the doctor?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.104
As a matter of fact, we did.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.773
We were on our way
to see him anyway.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.275
He checked Amelia thoroughly.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.709
She didn't even have a bruise.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.412
Did anyone other than
you and Clay

17:59.446 --> 18:01.614
help to look after the baby,
like, um...

18:01.648 --> 18:03.383
- like a nanny?
- Maybe Charles here.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.052
I don't believe in
outsourcing childcare.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.789
Charles cares for the house,
not for the people in it.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.124
Thank you, Charles.

18:11.158 --> 18:14.561
Do you remember Amelia
having a fall of any kind?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.563
Off a bed or a couch?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.797
No, I don't.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.400
Amelia didn't fall.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.902
And as I understand it,
the timeline may have shifted,

18:22.935 --> 18:25.805
but that doesn't mean
Gabrielle didn't shake her.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.575
But there were other people
alone with Amelia.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.743
For example, her father, Clay.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.079
And Clay had a son
from his first marriage.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.148
Declan.
He was ten at the time, right?

18:35.182 --> 18:37.817
Declan was away
at boarding school.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.653
He only had the pleasure
of meeting Amelia once,

18:40.687 --> 18:41.754
when she was born.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.956
And Clay was wonderful
with Amelia.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.492
You seem very convinced.

18:45.525 --> 18:49.629
This is a strong, loving
and tight-knit family.

18:49.662 --> 18:53.933
We take care of our children.
We love our children.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.135
We protect our children.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.171
The only harm
that came to Amelia

18:58.205 --> 19:01.007
was at the hands of a woman
I deeply regret

19:01.040 --> 19:02.509
ever married my son.

19:02.542 --> 19:06.646
I told Clay she wasn't
good enough for our family,

19:06.679 --> 19:09.549
and I was tragically right.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.684
Charles?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.354
Now, if that's all,

19:14.387 --> 19:16.723
Charles will see you out.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.561
Hi, Charles.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.583
Declan Vandenhey?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.653
- Yeah.
- I'm Bodie Quick.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.887
Ezekiel Boudreau.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.089
We represent your stepmom,
Gabrielle Parcell.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.325
Gabrielle's in prison.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.227
We work on wrongful
conviction cases.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.563
You think she didn't do it?

19:56.596 --> 19:58.407
There's new science that shows
she probably didn't.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.400
We'd like to ask you
a few questions about

20:00.433 --> 20:01.668
who was taking care of Amelia.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.403
I can't talk right now.
I'm at work.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.904
Work study?

20:04.937 --> 20:07.206
What is this, an exercise
in character building?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.175
What do you mean?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.848
I mean, there are buildings
on this campus

20:10.877 --> 20:12.178
named after your family.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.013
You don't exactly need help
with tuition.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.850
I'm not close to my grandmother.
I don't want her money.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.019
And I can't help you.
I barely knew Amelia.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.522
Why aren't you close to your
grandmother? What happened?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.733
Look, I don't want to have
anything to do with that family.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.759
Truly terrible people.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.094
How about your dad?

20:28.127 --> 20:30.530
How did he behave
after Amelia was born?

20:30.563 --> 20:33.933
I don't want anything
to do with my dad, either.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.403
I don't even speak to him, okay?

20:36.436 --> 20:39.238
And like I said,
I have to get back to work.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.281
There's nothing more touching
than a loving and devoted son.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.782
Why do you think Declan has

20:49.816 --> 20:51.451
a terrible relationship
with his dad?

20:51.484 --> 20:52.785
I don't know.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.721
Infidelity to his mother.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.423
Emotionally unavailable.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.558
A thousand ways
to screw up a kid.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.792
Parenthood is a minefield.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.127
Like you would know.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.297
Look, here's the thing.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.766
So, Nikki's got a kid.

21:06.799 --> 21:10.069
She... Her sister has a kid.
Had-had a kid.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.405
Nikki's... Nikki's raising
a kid. That's the deal.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.407
Damn. Scaring you off?

21:14.441 --> 21:16.909
No. I thought about it a lot.
I'm not scared.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.578
- No.
- I'm terrified.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.748
She called me a man-child,
and she's right.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.982
I dress up like a ninja.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.283
What makes one a man-child

21:24.317 --> 21:26.486
can also make them
a terrific father.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.489
- Yeah?
- You might have a great relationship with the kid.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.090
Yeah.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.925
Or I'll stab him
with a sword by accident,

21:32.959 --> 21:34.994
and then you and Madeline
will have to exonerate me

21:35.027 --> 21:36.496
for ninja baby syndrome.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.331
All right, listen,
here's the thing.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.433
You're never ready
to have a kid.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.802
Irene and I did everything
according to plan,

21:42.835 --> 21:44.371
and I live in a hotel now.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.840
We got separated.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.476
Dude. You all right?

21:49.509 --> 21:51.611
Hey, listen.
I love everything about my kids.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.312
I wouldn't undo anything
in my life.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.781
So you're saying
I should do this.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.183
I can't
make that decision for you.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.118
Come on, Easy, please. Please.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.853
Please make this decision
for me, man.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.823
Yeah, you got to decide
for yourself, brother.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.530
He truly hates his father.

22:10.563 --> 22:13.032
Is it possible Clay was abusive
and the mother didn't see it?

22:13.065 --> 22:15.134
- Or didn't want to?
- It's possible,

22:15.167 --> 22:17.470
but Clay seemed
genuinely hopeful about

22:17.504 --> 22:19.539
finding out
what happened to Amelia.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.207
Can I help you?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.710
I'm Frances Bonnett,
Clay Vandenhey's ex-wife.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.145
I got a phone call
from Ezekiel Boudreau.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.480
Just call me Easy.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.715
Come on in.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.717
I felt sorry for Gabrielle.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.886
I wanted to warn her
about the Vandenheys.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.322
But when Clay and I divorced,

22:36.355 --> 22:38.725
I received a substantial
settlement.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.326
That came with strings.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.228
- You signed an NDA.
- If I talk to you

22:42.261 --> 22:44.030
about anything,
an army of lawyers

22:44.063 --> 22:45.703
will come and take
everything that I have.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.200
And you have something to say.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.903
You could have told us
about the NDA over the phone.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.906
Just point us
in the right direction.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.108
I promise we won't
bring you into it at all.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.184
There was abuse in that family.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.352
Clay?

23:06.385 --> 23:07.754
No.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.722
He was the one being abused...

23:09.756 --> 23:12.024
by Deborah.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.292
She beat him as a kid.

23:15.294 --> 23:18.030
And I can't prove it, but
I think she hurt Declan, too.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.398
What makes you say that?

23:20.967 --> 23:22.702
When Declan was eight,

23:22.735 --> 23:24.871
he came home from a weekend
at Grandma's lake house

23:24.904 --> 23:26.606
with a broken arm.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.808
She told me he fell off a horse.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.212
But by the way he was acting...

23:33.245 --> 23:35.448
I know when
my son's lying to me.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.950
I tried to tell Clay.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.619
But Deborah has
a weird hold on him.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.455
So then I sent Declan
to boarding school, and...

23:43.923 --> 23:46.225
Clay and I broke up
a few months later.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.761
Do you think
Deborah hurt Amelia?

23:49.762 --> 23:51.263
It wouldn't surprise me.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.000
At all.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.907
You don't find what you want,
so you just start

24:00.940 --> 24:02.909
accusing other members
of my family?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.443
We understand your anger, Clay,

24:04.477 --> 24:05.912
but we know
your mother abused you.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.747
- You don't know anything!
- We do.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.582
We know you're a grown man
who needs

24:09.616 --> 24:11.117
to stop covering for his mother.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.920
We know that your mother abused
you and your son Declan.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.955
My mother never laid
a hand on Declan.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.928
Remember Declan's
horseback riding accident

24:21.961 --> 24:23.796
when he was eight years old?

24:28.134 --> 24:30.937
Been talking to my ex-wife.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.605
Your ex-wife signed an NDA.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.807
We've been talking
to a lot of people.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.013
You knew Declan didn't fall
off that horse, didn't you?

24:48.387 --> 24:51.524
Declan told us
he doesn't speak to you anymore.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.993
That he doesn't want
anything to do with you.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.168
Isn't reconciling with your son

25:02.201 --> 25:04.503
more important than protecting
your abusive mother?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.376
She can't hurt you anymore.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.715
Declan was...

25:15.748 --> 25:17.750
an exceptional rider.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.320
I didn't want to believe
that she was doing to him

25:21.353 --> 25:23.189
the same thing
that she had done to me.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.824
She hurt him.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.493
And you.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.329
Don't you think it's possible
she also hurt Amelia?

25:30.362 --> 25:32.832
No. No.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.500
No, she loved Amelia.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.003
I'm sure she loved you
and Declan, too.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.538
But this has got to stop now.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.013
If she did something
to hurt Amelia,

25:47.046 --> 25:49.381
I know would have
helped her cover it up.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.185
Does your mother
know you're here?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.021
I don't need
her permission for anything.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.189
Especially if it concerns
my own children.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.858
Declan is now over 18.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.360
So the law says I can
only share his records with him.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.030
As for Amelia,
we closed her file years ago.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.531
I'll have to search for it.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.845
- I'll get it back to you.
- That sounds like a runaround.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.538
Every time my mother hurt me,

26:12.571 --> 26:15.207
I got to come see Dr. O'Barr.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.109
You gave me candy,
you spoke to me kindly,

26:17.143 --> 26:19.912
but you never reported it
to the police, did you?

26:19.946 --> 26:22.481
I don't know what
you're talking about, Clay.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.251
Sure you do.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.053
I spent ten years in prison

26:27.086 --> 26:29.889
and the next seven
practicing criminal law.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.291
I've seen all kinds of evil.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.393
But a pediatrician
who profits from

26:34.426 --> 26:35.928
covering up child abuse...

26:35.962 --> 26:37.472
Got to be the worst kind of evil.
Special place in hell

26:37.496 --> 26:39.131
- type of evil.
- Careful.

26:39.165 --> 26:42.068
Spurious allegations
are called defamation.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.071
Actually, it's only defamation
if it isn't true.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.438
I think you people
need to leave.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.908
We're leaving.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.078
But we're not going away.
We'll be back with a subpoena.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.113
And after we find what we need
in those records...

26:54.146 --> 26:56.448
We're gonna make it all public.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.251
I'm sure someone else
will be back

26:59.285 --> 27:01.287
for your medical license.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.460
Yeah, it's Jeffrey.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.600
My goodness, Mrs. Vandenhey,
you can't just barge in here

27:14.633 --> 27:16.178
without an appointment.
This is highly inappropriate.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.612
- I don't need an appointment.
- You realize...

27:17.636 --> 27:19.772
Who the hell do you people
think you are?

27:19.806 --> 27:21.640
- Hello, Mrs. Vandenhey.
- Jeffrey called me

27:21.674 --> 27:23.442
the minute you left his office.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.278
You can't go around harassing
the people who work for me.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.614
We can if they're protecting
child abusers.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.950
Isn't that precisely
what you people are doing?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.618
You're protecting the abuser

27:32.651 --> 27:35.354
who was convicted of murdering
my granddaughter.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.690
That's not what it looks like
to us. We spoke to your son.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.658
You manipulated him.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.461
My lawyers are drafting
a cease and desist order.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.196
Then a lawsuit.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.799
We'll destroy you
with legal fees alone.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.535
- You scared, Easy?
- Petrified.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.570
What are you afraid we'll find?

27:52.839 --> 27:55.207
You may have bullied
my son, Ms. Scott,

27:55.241 --> 27:57.209
but you won't bully me.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.711
Kate.

28:07.053 --> 28:10.389
Okay, so I think I figured
out who all the girls are.

28:10.422 --> 28:13.492
Get this. All these girls...

28:13.525 --> 28:14.727
They were there that night.

28:25.772 --> 28:28.007
I also pulled the deed
from that creepy house.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.676
It turns out it was owned
by some company called.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.846
Karna-Surya-Kunti, Inc.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.581
"Surya" means sun in Sanskrit.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.184
Right, right, you just
happen to know that?

28:38.217 --> 28:40.920
I did a lot of reading
in the prison library.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.588
Eastern religions was a fave.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.056
Okay.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.025
Hey, by the way, check this out.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.194
This is a painting from
another room in the house.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.097
They made it into some sort of
spiritual room or something.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.199
What's this "R" about?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.034
It's got to be a name, right?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.069
All right, if we stay
in Eastern names,

28:57.103 --> 29:00.039
there's Raj, Rishni, Rashneesh.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.774
Ravi is the Hindu god
of the sun.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.746
Wow. Okay, this is getting
really weird.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.215
No. It actually makes
perfect sense.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.616
Eastern religious symbolism,

29:10.649 --> 29:14.086
drugs, a secretive group
of young girls.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.456
- Levi, it was a cult.
- Come on.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.226
You really believe that-that
Rosemary would join a cult?

29:20.259 --> 29:21.894
I think that, clearly,
we didn't know her

29:21.928 --> 29:23.629
as well as we thought we did.

29:23.662 --> 29:26.265
Okay, if "R" is a person's name,

29:26.298 --> 29:28.067
then that has to be
the leader, right?

29:28.100 --> 29:31.137
- Right.
- Every cult has a guru.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.906
Keith Raniere,
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh...

29:33.940 --> 29:37.476
- Charles Manson.
- All charismatic manipulators

29:37.509 --> 29:40.913
who promise enlightenment,
and then dupe their followers

29:40.947 --> 29:43.082
into doing whatever they want.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.451
Keith Raniere had all his girls

29:45.484 --> 29:48.087
on a crazy low-calorie diet.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.422
Kept them skinny
and mentally unstable.

29:50.456 --> 29:51.991
Well, that would explain
the Adderall.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.259
That's what I'm thinking.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.927
Do you want to be a virgin

29:54.961 --> 29:56.495
- in college?
- No. Do you?

29:56.528 --> 29:59.866
No. So let's get it over with.

30:01.868 --> 30:04.636
Right before she died,
Rosemary was fixated

30:04.670 --> 30:06.172
on us losing our virginity.

30:06.205 --> 30:09.775
I thought it was about the two
of us going off to college.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.843
It was probably this.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.012
You think she was
recruiting you.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.981
All I know is that
this cult is the key

30:15.014 --> 30:16.315
to what happened that night.

30:16.348 --> 30:17.950
We have to talk
to Linda Barrett again.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.694
No, Heather Husband has
Linda Barrett shut down,

30:19.718 --> 30:22.054
- she's scared to talk.
- Who else is there?

30:23.655 --> 30:25.892
Let me see.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.527
Wait.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.862
Sarah Tawney.

30:29.896 --> 30:32.298
She sent me a Christmas card
in prison.

30:32.331 --> 30:35.167
She said she believed
we were innocent.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.139
Maybe that's because
she knows who's guilty.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.473
I was under his spell.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.641
We all were.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.043
He was so handsome.

30:44.076 --> 30:47.313
Listen, did you, um...

30:47.346 --> 30:50.382
did you have sex with Ravi?

30:52.718 --> 30:54.153
What did Linda tell you?

30:54.186 --> 30:57.356
She said that...
you all had sex with him.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.194
He made us believe that sex was
the path to enlightenment.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.163
It was so screwed up.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.165
But at the time,
it felt like my salvation.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.409
High school was horrible for me.

31:07.433 --> 31:11.170
I was insecure, fat.
I didn't know where I belonged.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.838
I was...

31:12.871 --> 31:15.241
Maybe it's a teenage girl
thing, but...

31:15.274 --> 31:17.009
I felt unworthy.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.510
Ravi changed all that.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.347
So, how long was Rosemary
in the group?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.082
She was one of the first
to join.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.584
She loved it.
Rosemary had a wild side.

31:25.617 --> 31:28.787
She instantly became
Ravi's favorite.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.959
That piss the other girls off?

31:34.460 --> 31:36.929
It pissed off Heather Dupinski.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.797
She was the star
until Rosemary came along.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.534
Listen, um...

31:42.568 --> 31:44.870
do you think that-that...

31:44.903 --> 31:47.940
Heather could have possibly
killed Rosemary over this?

31:49.608 --> 31:50.885
Look, I-I got to get
back to work.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.087
I'd really appreciate
if you didn't tell anybody

31:52.111 --> 31:54.046
I was involved in all of this.
I just...

31:54.080 --> 31:55.881
Even though it happened
a long time ago,

31:55.914 --> 31:58.784
it really screwed my life up.
Please?

31:58.817 --> 32:01.620
- I'll get going. Thank you for this information.
- Yeah.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.996
What are you doing
with my money?

32:10.997 --> 32:13.065
- Hi, Rick.
- Hello, Gore.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.066
What do you mean, your money?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.767
I'm hearing whispers about

32:15.801 --> 32:19.338
my funds being used
for non-campaign activities.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.508
Come on, Gore,
I've got ears everywhere.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.244
Okay. I'll tell you.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.180
But I have to ask
for your discretion.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.283
This is really big.
I don't want it to leak.

32:31.317 --> 32:34.520
Well, I'm nothing
if not discreet.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.291
The money went to the campaign,
in a manner of speaking.

32:39.325 --> 32:42.794
I used it to search the lake
at Cathedral Cove.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.599
Why'd you do that?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.101
To finish what I started.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.603
And the campaign manager
you thrust on me told me

32:51.637 --> 32:54.440
if I found new evidence
implicating Madeline Scott

32:54.473 --> 32:57.676
in the Lynch murder, I would
dominate every news cycle.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.012
Well, he's right.

33:00.046 --> 33:03.049
So, did you?

33:05.651 --> 33:07.353
This old lantern

33:07.386 --> 33:11.023
matches the head wound
on Rosemary Lynch.

33:11.057 --> 33:14.293
I finally found the murder
weapon, after all these years.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.894
Let me see that.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.300
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.869
The M.E. confirmed it.
The contusion in her skull

33:23.902 --> 33:25.304
matches that lantern.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.507
The same metal fragments
were lodged in her brain.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.542
It's just a matter of time
before I connect it

33:30.576 --> 33:32.044
to Madeline Scott.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.980
This isn't a lark, Rick.
This is justice.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.716
I would sacrifice my entire
political career for it.

33:37.749 --> 33:41.387
Well, if you can connect
this lantern to Madeline Scott,

33:41.420 --> 33:43.889
you won't have
to sacrifice anything.

33:43.922 --> 33:47.093
You arrest her
before the polls close...

33:48.927 --> 33:51.230
you'll win by a landslide.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.901
It looks like they covered
their tracks pretty well.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.736
Yep. Nothing but general
wellness checkups

33:57.769 --> 33:59.238
and standard blood tests.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.673
O'Barr is their private
concierge doctor.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.008
If they had something to hide,

34:03.041 --> 34:05.577
he may not have kept
a record of it.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.546
Wait a second.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.416
Didn't Deborah say that Declan
was at boarding school

34:10.449 --> 34:12.418
in the days
before the baby's death?

34:12.451 --> 34:15.587
Yes, when she was bragging
about not outsourcing childcare.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.688
Well, it says here
he got a flu shot

34:17.723 --> 34:19.190
on the Saturday
before Amelia died.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.025
He was home?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.094
Why would Deborah
lie about that?

34:23.129 --> 34:25.764
I already told you,
I have nothing more to say

34:25.797 --> 34:28.100
- about my father.
- What about your grandmother?

34:28.134 --> 34:31.270
- What about her?
- She said you were at school the week your sister died,

34:31.303 --> 34:33.539
but Dr. O'Barr gave you
a flu shot on Saturday.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.706
You were home.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.217
Why would your grandmother
lie about that?

34:36.242 --> 34:38.210
You should ask her.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.446
Were you with Amelia
that weekend, Declan?

34:40.478 --> 34:42.614
- Did something happen?
- N-No.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.449
Doctor said Amelia
got hurt on Tuesday.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.751
I was already back at school.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.453
The doctor's timeline
was revised.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.954
It shows Amelia's injury

34:48.987 --> 34:51.089
probably happened
over the weekend.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.297
The weekend?

34:58.330 --> 35:00.098
Yes.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.272
Declan, we know that
your grandmother hurt you

35:06.305 --> 35:09.007
and that she asked you
to keep quiet about everything.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.310
I... I can't.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.479
Hey, hey, Declan.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.314
Abuse is cyclical.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.983
Now, you were only doing
what you were taught.

35:20.018 --> 35:22.020
It's time to break the cycle.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.996
I think it was me.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.633
I think I killed her.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.606
Gabrielle wouldn't
come out of her room.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.442
They said she was depressed.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.777
My dad was playing golf,

35:45.811 --> 35:49.315
so it was just my grandma and I
taking care of Amelia.

35:49.348 --> 35:52.551
She asked me to watch her
while she went to the bathroom.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.189
We were in the kitchen.

35:57.223 --> 35:59.191
I was...

35:59.225 --> 36:01.227
I was trying to watch a video.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.564
Amelia wouldn't stop crying.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.701
I got irritated.

36:09.735 --> 36:13.205
I kicked the high chair.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.140
It-it slid across the floor,

36:15.173 --> 36:17.343
and she slammed her head
against the wall.

36:19.245 --> 36:20.812
Your Honor,

36:20.846 --> 36:24.516
this is the make of high chair
that the family used.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.055
Note that the bruising on Amelia

36:30.088 --> 36:32.758
is consistent
with the high chair strap.

36:34.893 --> 36:38.530
Declan, what happened
after Amelia hit her head?

36:38.564 --> 36:41.233
I asked my grandmother

36:41.267 --> 36:42.834
if it was my fault.

36:42.868 --> 36:46.405
And she said no,
that it was Gabrielle's.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.674
That Gabrielle
never wanted Amelia.

36:48.707 --> 36:52.578
She made me swear never to tell
anyone what happened.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.348
In my family...

36:56.382 --> 36:58.384
you learn to do as you're told

36:58.417 --> 37:00.419
or suffer the consequences.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.789
Declan, what are
the consequences?

37:06.958 --> 37:10.429
When I was eight
and talked back,

37:10.462 --> 37:13.231
Grandma twisted my arm so hard
she broke it.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.136
She told my mom
I fell off a horse.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.542
My first memory ever

37:23.575 --> 37:27.379
is of my grandma throwing
a marble chess piece at my head.

37:27.413 --> 37:31.317
My dad was clueless,
but my mom f-figured out...

37:33.319 --> 37:35.787
I'm so sorry, Gabby.
I-I didn't know.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.126
I didn't know.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.161
Thank you, Declan.

37:45.163 --> 37:47.165
Nothing further, Your Honor.

37:49.835 --> 37:50.969
No questions, Your Honor.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.071
Your Honor, the defense

37:53.104 --> 37:55.741
moves to vacate... I'll save
you the trouble, Ms. Scott.

37:55.774 --> 37:59.978
Ms. Parcell, I would like
to personally apologize

38:00.011 --> 38:01.647
for everything
you've been through

38:01.680 --> 38:04.916
and offer condolences
for the death of your child.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.151
You're free to go.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.424
One moment, please.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.593
While it's not part
of the current matter

38:14.626 --> 38:17.262
before this court,
I find it necessary

38:17.295 --> 38:20.632
to address
Deborah Vandenhey directly.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.303
If not for the statute
of limitations,

38:25.337 --> 38:29.608
I would issue a warrant for your
arrest on charges of perjury,

38:29.641 --> 38:32.110
obstruction of justice
and child abuse.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.279
This court cannot punish you.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.983
But rest assured, madam,
you will be judged harshly

38:38.016 --> 38:40.452
in the court of public opinion.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.121
Court adjourned.

38:50.228 --> 38:53.665
Thank you. Thank you.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.701
You're welcome.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.970
I'm glad we finally
got to the truth.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.364
- Clay, don't even start.
- No, no.

39:02.007 --> 39:05.644
I don't know what to say,
e-except I'm sorry.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.646
For everything.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.147
I appreciate that.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.817
- I'm so, so sorry, Gabrielle.
- No. No.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.652
It was an accident.

39:13.685 --> 39:17.856
You were just a child,
and I don't blame you at all.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.826
So please don't blame yourself.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.594
Mom.

39:24.430 --> 39:28.700
Criminal prosecutions are about
punishment, not healing.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.036
But when I look around,
I don't see a world

39:31.069 --> 39:33.839
that's lacking in retribution.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.842
I see a world suffering.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.011
There is a deep,
dark pain stirring

39:40.045 --> 39:41.513
in many of us.

39:41.547 --> 39:44.349
We're afraid to be shaken
out of that pain

39:44.382 --> 39:47.385
because it feels safe
and familiar.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.889
Like we need it to survive.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.925
But the opposite is true.

39:53.959 --> 39:57.195
We need to shine a light
onto the darkness.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.531
We need to face that pain

39:59.565 --> 40:01.867
and see it,

40:01.900 --> 40:03.401
because that is the only way

40:03.435 --> 40:05.704
we will truly heal.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.706
- Hey, you made it!
- Come on in here.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.041
It's freezing out.
How you doing, little man?

40:10.075 --> 40:12.210
What do you think?
Handshake? Fist bump?

40:12.243 --> 40:15.547
Slap me some skin like 1977.
No...?

40:15.581 --> 40:17.549
- How about a hug?
- Yeah.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.951
What is that?
Who brought the hot dogs

40:19.985 --> 40:22.220
and the chicken tenders
and the chips and the...

40:22.253 --> 40:23.254
Do you like that stuff?

40:23.288 --> 40:24.456
- Yes.
- Get it.

40:24.490 --> 40:27.225
Like a Dobermann
in a meat factory.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.394
So, hey, what are we doing here?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.597
- We're eating junk food.
- Yeah, I can see that.

40:33.465 --> 40:36.468
I've been working
on this case, right?

40:36.502 --> 40:38.269
And it's made me realize
that if kids

40:38.303 --> 40:41.673
don't have strong role models,
they can get pretty screwed up.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.610
So...?

40:44.643 --> 40:48.446
So... you make me
a better person.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.583
And I think that
I might even be able to be

40:51.617 --> 40:53.752
a good example for Nathan.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.622
And I love you,
and I think that maybe together,

40:56.655 --> 40:58.657
you-you and me could ma...

41:01.292 --> 41:02.761
Gross.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.596
Hey, k-kissing's not gross.

41:04.630 --> 41:05.931
Yeah, it is.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.934
Hey. Have you ever flown
like Superman before?

41:08.967 --> 41:11.937
- Not really.
- You're gonna fly today, my man!

41:15.173 --> 41:17.275
Has it been 16 years?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.977
Seems like yesterday.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.488
You've certainly become
a fine young woman.

41:20.512 --> 41:23.615
Well, you haven't done so bad
for yourself, either.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.817
- I donated to your campaign.
- Really?

41:25.851 --> 41:28.153
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.789
So, why exactly
did you want to meet with me?

41:30.822 --> 41:34.292
I've been revisiting
the Rosemary Lynch case.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.127
In your case, as in Gabrielle's,

41:36.161 --> 41:38.463
the prosecution used outdated,

41:38.496 --> 41:41.132
misogynistic tropes
about how women should behave.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.134
They kept the truth in the dark,

41:43.168 --> 41:45.170
and they allowed
this suffering to continue.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.639
I think, in Gabrielle's case,
the prosecution just

41:47.673 --> 41:49.808
believed another version
of the truth.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.343
Have you ever seen
this lantern before?

41:55.413 --> 41:57.883
I don't think so. Why?

41:57.916 --> 42:01.219
It was found at the bottom
of Cathedral Cove.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.054
It has been proven
to be the weapon

42:03.088 --> 42:05.757
that was used to kill Rosemary.

42:07.693 --> 42:09.327
I mean, they weren't evil.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.330
They were just convinced
of the guilt of their defendant.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.834
If someone were
to have been seen

42:15.867 --> 42:18.536
with this lantern the night
that Rosemary was murdered...

42:19.571 --> 42:21.940
we could arrest that someone.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.214
Yeah.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.249
I remember it now.

42:32.417 --> 42:35.186
After Madeline and Rosemary
had the fight,

42:35.220 --> 42:38.223
Madeline chased after Rosemary.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.258
She was carrying that lantern.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.862
And that earnest belief,

42:43.895 --> 42:46.765
that unrelenting commitment
to justice,

42:46.798 --> 42:49.901
blinded them from seeing
any evidence of innocence.

42:49.935 --> 42:51.746
- Excuse me, what's going on?
- Can we help you?

42:51.770 --> 42:53.571
- What the hell is this?
- Easy?

42:53.605 --> 42:54.906
What's happening?

42:54.940 --> 42:56.074
Madeline Scott,

42:56.107 --> 42:57.709
you are under arrest

42:57.743 --> 42:59.410
for the murder
of Rosemary Lynch.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.285
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH.

43:42.387 --> 43:44.431
You've seen the fight
for justice on Proven Innocent.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.825
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:49.627 --> 43:52.297
Rule number one
if you want to stay alive.

43:52.330 --> 43:54.199
Don't lie to your doctor.

43:57.402 --> 44:00.471
- Profits over patients, again.
- You save your morality lesson.

44:00.505 --> 44:01.840
You have to save him!

44:01.873 --> 44:03.942
Be careful.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.977
- You tried to kill him.
- I had no choice!

Shall we?

44:14.219 --> 44:17.488
The Resident,
all new, Mondays at 800 on Fox.

44:20.425 --> 44:22.260
As they began
their hours of duty...

44:23.695 --> 44:26.497
it was a bell
that started it off.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.201
Each alarm was sounded
by a bell...

44:30.235 --> 44:32.971
that called them to place
their lives in jeopardy...

44:33.004 --> 44:36.074
for the good
of their fellow man.

44:36.107 --> 44:38.710
When the alarm had come
to an end,

44:38.744 --> 44:41.479
the bell rang,
to signal that end.

44:41.512 --> 44:43.882

44:43.915 --> 44:49.120
