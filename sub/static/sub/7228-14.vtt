a pretty tutu,

I love you

you stand for
in the world of ballet, and...

No offense, Lambie,

look like dancing.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.826
This isn't the dance,
Stuffy!

03:21.910 --> 03:25.955
This is how we ballerinas
warm up before we dance!

Warm up?
I'll melt if I warm up!

Lambie's right.
Ballerinas are athletes

03:43.056 --> 03:46.768
and athletes always warm up
before a performance or game.

03:46.851 --> 03:51.689

make it ballerinas,
athletes and dragons!

I need to take
a closer look at your leg.

moving it could
make it worse.

Like I said,

The cast is to make
your leg stay still
while it heals.

to being the greatest
toy dancer ever made.

thinkin', sugar.

that leg overnight,

a broken leg would take
much longer to heal.

will dry overnight.

dance now, but you just need
to be a little patient.

Uh, Doc, she's already
a little patient.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.871

11:02.662 --> 11:04.622
Go ahead, Bella.
Try it out!

11:08.918 --> 11:10.336
I can dance again!

Oh, thank you.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.567
That was baaa-utiful!

11:33.943 --> 11:36.153
I've always thought
your dancing was amazing,

11:36.237 --> 11:38.781
but seeing
how brave you are,

11:38.864 --> 11:41.409
I think
you're amazing, too!

11:41.492 --> 11:43.077
Oh, thank you.

11:43.577 --> 11:47.832
The only thing better
than a true fan
is a true friend.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.001
Would you like
to dance a dance with me?

11:51.085 --> 11:53.754
[gasps]
Me and the amazing
Bella the ballerina

11:53.838 --> 11:56.507
dancing a duet here
in front of my friends?

11:57.633 --> 11:58.968

11:59.051 --> 12:00.803
Yes. Yes, I would.

[Doc reading]

12:17.736 --> 12:20.114
Three, two, one...

12:20.531 --> 12:21.866
Bubbles!

12:27.371 --> 12:28.456
Bubbles!

12:29.665 --> 12:31.041
I got three bubbles!

12:31.125 --> 12:32.418
I got six.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.712
I got two at once!

12:35.921 --> 12:37.006
Rudi!

12:37.089 --> 12:38.799
[barking]

12:41.343 --> 12:43.554
Hey! No more bubbles!

12:47.683 --> 12:49.852
I think Bubble Monkey's
out of bubbles.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.353
Better fill her up.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.689
Can I do it?
Please, can I do it?

12:53.772 --> 12:55.107
Please?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.066
Okay.

[Doc] Rudi!

13:01.822 --> 13:03.240
Rudi, come back.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.121
Huh. Must be...

13:09.205 --> 13:10.080
this one.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.001
I did it!

13:15.419 --> 13:17.838
I filled Bubble Monkey
all by myself.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.798
You know what that means!

13:21.550 --> 13:22.468
Three!

13:22.551 --> 13:23.469
Two!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.183
You said
you filled it up.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.226
I did!

13:30.309 --> 13:31.519
Lemme see.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.147
Hmm.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.732
It feels like it's full.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.360
I know that look.

13:39.443 --> 13:40.736
What look?

13:40.819 --> 13:41.779
That one.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.281
That look you get
when toys don't work.

13:44.615 --> 13:48.536
I don't know how,
but you always get broken
toys to work again.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.705
Well, they don't call me
"Doc" for nothing!

13:52.164 --> 13:54.083
So, you'll fix it?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.125
Please!

13:55.543 --> 13:57.920
I'll see if I can
figure it out.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.924
Hi, Doc!
Hi, Dad!

14:02.758 --> 14:04.134
Want some strawberries?

14:04.218 --> 14:07.513
They're super healthy
and fresh,
picked by Farmer Dad!

14:07.930 --> 14:09.473
Yay! Strawberries.

14:09.765 --> 14:10.766
Thanks, Dad!

14:13.185 --> 14:15.354
Mmmmmm.
Delicious!

14:15.437 --> 14:17.147
Can I take these
to the clinic?

14:17.231 --> 14:18.524
I've got a patient.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.025
You bet.

Howdy do!

14:31.412 --> 14:33.038
Good to see ya,
Doc!

14:33.122 --> 14:36.792
Hey, look, Doc brought
Bubble Monkey over to play!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.752
I love chasing bubbles.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.964
Really? I always think
the bubbles are chasing me.

14:42.798 --> 14:47.177
Bubbles, bubbles so much fun,
bubbles, bubbles for everyone!

14:47.636 --> 14:50.514

Aww. I don't see
any bubbles.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.610
[gasps, exhales]

15:03.277 --> 15:04.862
I can't blow my bubbles.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.698
Oh, no, no, no!

15:08.115 --> 15:10.743
I didn't bring you here
to play this time.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.162
I brought you
to my clinic because,

15:13.245 --> 15:16.874
well, you're a toy,
and you're not working.

15:18.459 --> 15:24.006
Boy, one minute
you're blowing bubbles,
the next you're a broken toy.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.674

Your bubble pressure is good,

Let's check your blow power.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.965
I want you
to blow on this feather
as hard as you can.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.384
I'll try way super hard!

How did I do?
[panting]

16:16.976 --> 16:18.811
Did I do super-good?

16:20.020 --> 16:23.273
You should have been able
to blow the feather
much further.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.608
Let me try!

16:24.984 --> 16:26.068
Good idea.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.279
If you blow on the feather,
we can compare
how hard you puff

16:29.363 --> 16:31.281
to how hard
Bubble Monkey puffed.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.662
Roarrrr!

16:37.287 --> 16:39.289
Stuffy blew
much harder than me!

Yay for Stuffy!

16:42.042 --> 16:43.836
Aww, shucks.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.964
You're right.
He did blow harder.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.966

16:53.679 --> 16:54.555
Good.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.348
Now breathe out.

[exhales]

16:58.475 --> 16:59.810
Hmm.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.395
What ya thinking, Doc?

17:02.187 --> 17:05.357
Sounds like some goop
is blocking up
your bubble pumper.

17:05.773 --> 17:09.028
Goop?
That sounds super yucky.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.530
Are you having
any other symptoms?

17:11.946 --> 17:14.907
Oh, I don't know.
What are symptoms?

17:15.325 --> 17:17.953
Symptoms are your body's way
of talking to you,

17:18.037 --> 17:21.540
like when your ear hurts
or you have an itchy spot.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.044
Things like that are symptoms
that something is wrong.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.672
Well, gosh.
I do have a tummy ache.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.301
A tummy ache. Hmm...

17:32.634 --> 17:36.013
Well, sugar,
maybe you're just
a hungry little monkey.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.558
Oh, sometimes
when I'm hungry,
my tummy growls,

17:39.641 --> 17:40.851
like this.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.853
[gurgling]

17:42.936 --> 17:45.147
Oh, that was scary, Stuffy!

17:45.522 --> 17:48.442
Even dragon tummy
gurgles are scary!

17:48.817 --> 17:51.361
I don't think I feel hungry.

17:51.779 --> 17:56.366
In fact,
I feel way super stuffed!

17:57.076 --> 18:00.370
Alma filled you up
right before I brought you
in here,

18:00.829 --> 18:03.332
and now you have
a tummy ache.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.710
Is it okay
if I give your tummy
a little squeeze?

18:07.002 --> 18:11.590
If it helps me
blow beautiful bubbles
again, then you bet!

18:15.469 --> 18:16.720
Aaaah!

18:20.015 --> 18:22.309
Help!
I'm stuck to a dragon,

18:22.392 --> 18:25.145
and he has scary
tummy gurgles!

18:25.479 --> 18:26.522

18:29.983 --> 18:30.943
Help!
Help!

18:37.866 --> 18:40.077
Well, this is
a sticky situation.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.455
Oops!
I'm super-duper sorry!

18:43.997 --> 18:46.291
Let's get them
pulled apart, Hallie.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.544
I'll have to use
my hippo muscles!

18:49.002 --> 18:53.257
One, two, three... pull!

18:55.092 --> 18:56.468
Whoaaa!

18:57.010 --> 18:58.428
Oh, thanks, Doc.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.765
I was worried
I was gonna be stuck
to Stuffy forever.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.726
And his scary tummy
could gurgle at any second!

19:06.728 --> 19:07.813
Weird.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.023
This is paste.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.818
It can't be paste, silly,

19:13.277 --> 19:15.863
'cause you can't make
bubbles with paste.

19:16.238 --> 19:20.325
I know.
But I'm pretty sure
this is paste.

19:21.577 --> 19:25.789
Before I can give you
a diagnosis, I have
to do some investigating.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.169
Can you get Stuffy and
Chilly cleaned up while
I talk to Emmie and Alma?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.838
Hallie Hippo,
reporting for cleanup duty!

19:32.921 --> 19:36.300
I'll get them cleaner
than a summer squash
at the car wash!

19:36.633 --> 19:37.551
I'll be back.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.015
Doc! Did you fix
Bubble Monkey?

19:43.473 --> 19:46.185
Not yet,
but I think
I'm onto something.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.687
Alma, what did you
fill her with?

19:49.229 --> 19:52.649
I used this one.
It's pink,
and pink is pretty.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.819
But Alma, this one
is the bubble soap.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.863
The pink one is paste.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.781
Oh. It is?

20:00.073 --> 20:02.784
[Emmie] You're only
supposed to fill it
with bubble soap.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.494
Does it matter?

20:04.578 --> 20:05.579
It sure does!

20:05.954 --> 20:09.499
It's just like with people.
We have to eat
the right things

20:09.583 --> 20:11.877
to make our bodies
healthy and feel good.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.503
We do?
Yep.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.965
We need fruits
and vegetables
instead of candy and sugar.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.636
Just like Bubble Monkey
needs bubble soap
instead of paste.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.804
Now that I know
what happened,

20:22.888 --> 20:26.767
I think I know
how to fix Bubble Monkey.
Be back in a jiffy!

20:28.810 --> 20:30.437
I have a diagnosis!

20:30.812 --> 20:31.730
Mercy me!

20:31.813 --> 20:34.691
Looks like it's time
for the <span style="style.default_1">Big Book of Boo-boos!</span>

of gunk-inside-atude!

20:39.988 --> 20:41.740
Gunk-inside-atude?

20:42.115 --> 20:44.701
That sounds
super duper yicky.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.495
How'd I get it?

20:46.870 --> 20:51.375
Alma accidentally
filled you with paste
instead of bubble soap.

20:55.712 --> 20:59.758

filled up right, just like
people need to eat right.

through your tubes.

that washed the paste out.

gooping me up.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.625
Now let's fill you up right.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.756
[giggling]

22:20.839 --> 22:24.051
Ahh! That feels
so much better!

22:24.801 --> 22:26.344
See if you can
blow bubbles now.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.763
Okay.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.307
Here... I... go!

22:30.640 --> 22:32.184
[inhales]

22:34.102 --> 22:35.562
Yay!

22:35.645 --> 22:36.980
It works!

22:37.439 --> 22:40.067
Oh, you did it, Doc!
You fixed her!

22:40.609 --> 22:44.488
Oh, thanks, Doc,
you're super fantastic!

22:44.988 --> 22:46.656
I do love my job.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.576
Oh, dear!
Bubbles are after me!

22:51.286 --> 22:53.580
Hey,
that was kinda fun!

22:53.914 --> 22:56.124
[laughing]

22:58.293 --> 23:01.713
Thank you so, so much
for fixing me, Doc!

23:02.047 --> 23:03.548
That's what doctors are for.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.384
Let's get you back
to Emmie and Alma.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.348
You're back!
[giggles]

23:11.723 --> 23:14.226
And this time,
I brought Bubble Monkey!

23:14.643 --> 23:15.727
Did you fix her?

23:16.186 --> 23:18.730
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.608
Three, two, one...

23:24.069 --> 23:25.362
Bubbles!

23:32.953 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:35.705 --> 23:38.291
<span style="style.default_1">To keep from spreading</span>
<span style="style.default_1">germs to your friends,</span>

23:40.210 --> 23:41.670
<span style="style.default_1">what should you do?</span>

23:42.295 --> 23:43.505
<span style="style.default_1">Wash your hands?</span>

23:45.340 --> 23:47.134
<span style="style.default_1">Play hippo bounce?</span>

23:49.261 --> 23:51.054
<span style="style.default_1">Or have a tickle fest?</span>

23:53.265 --> 23:54.599
<span style="style.default_1">That's right.</span>

23:54.683 --> 23:56.017
<span style="style.default_1">Wash your hands.</span>

23:58.436 --> 23:59.354
Aww.
