Pretty horse.

00:24.912 --> 00:28.247
Oh, you don't have to be afraid.

00:28.248 --> 00:30.516
I can sing you a song.

00:30.517 --> 00:31.684
Would you like that?

(groans)

01:43.467 --> 01:44.801
Did you miss me?

01:48.639 --> 01:50.640
Sorry for the delay, sir.

01:50.641 --> 01:52.081
Johnny here forgot his manners.

01:52.642 --> 01:54.443
Johnny, buddy,

01:54.444 --> 01:55.644
thought we had a deal...

01:55.645 --> 01:57.346
we help you, you help us, right?

01:57.347 --> 01:59.881
- Did Lorenzo change the meet?
- Don't know.

01:59.882 --> 02:02.818
Yo! I don't know.

02:02.819 --> 02:04.653
We know your boss is
unpredictable, but we promise

02:04.654 --> 02:07.823
- to protect you after we take him down.
- I'm being straight with you.

02:07.824 --> 02:09.625
'Zo didn't say nothing about a new meet.

02:09.626 --> 02:11.994
- Dude.
- But I can check.

02:11.995 --> 02:13.295
Okay?

02:15.798 --> 02:17.499
Come on. Come on.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.801
Make sure I can find you, okay?

02:24.807 --> 02:26.808
You best keep an eye on
your CI, Agent Mills.

02:26.809 --> 02:28.552
If Lorenzo gives us the slip,

02:28.553 --> 02:29.902
he won't come up for air for months.

02:29.903 --> 02:31.437
Yes, sir, but Johnny will come through.
When I was

02:31.438 --> 02:33.272
at the sheriff's department,
there was a case just like it.

02:33.273 --> 02:35.241
You're not with the sheriff's
department, are you?

02:35.242 --> 02:37.309
So stop thinking like
local law enforcement.

02:37.310 --> 02:39.688
Or isn't Quantico teaching that anymore?

02:39.689 --> 02:41.345
Look, you're moving up fast, okay?

02:41.346 --> 02:43.881
Which means somebody thinks you're good.

02:43.882 --> 02:45.082
So prove 'em right to me.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.083
(phone ringing)

02:46.084 --> 02:48.819
Excuse me, sir.

02:50.121 --> 02:51.889
Mills.

02:53.091 --> 02:54.558
Yeah, I know him.

02:54.559 --> 02:57.695
What? He's where?

02:57.696 --> 03:00.264
(door slams shut)

03:03.168 --> 03:06.070
OFFICER (over P.A.): Opening 513!

03:06.071 --> 03:08.906
(lock buzzes)

03:20.085 --> 03:24.121
Lieutenant... thank you for coming.

03:24.122 --> 03:26.924
Damn, Crane, what the hell happened?

03:26.925 --> 03:29.560
They told me they caught you
trying to enter the country

03:29.561 --> 03:31.128
with restricted materials.

03:31.129 --> 03:32.730
A matter which I shall address presently.

03:32.731 --> 03:34.898
(sighs) First, a more pressing issue.

03:34.899 --> 03:37.000
Uh-uh. How long you been here?

03:37.001 --> 03:39.336
- Uh, this is the morn of my fifth day.
- Fifth day.

03:39.337 --> 03:42.172
- And you're just now calling me?
- Yes, well,

03:42.173 --> 03:44.341
it has been some time
since last we spoke.

03:44.342 --> 03:46.310
You've been gone nine months.

03:46.311 --> 03:47.411
You said you needed to
take a little walkabout,

03:47.412 --> 03:49.279
clear your head... I understood.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.482
No, you've been through a lot,
but I don't hear from you,

03:51.483 --> 03:53.817
for nine months, and then,
this is the call that I get...

03:53.818 --> 03:56.253
to bail you out of the I.C.E.
detention center.

03:56.254 --> 03:58.188
Indeed, there is

03:58.189 --> 04:00.491
much upon which we need to catch up.

04:00.492 --> 04:01.959
You think?

04:01.960 --> 04:04.928
You're right.

04:04.929 --> 04:07.698
I have been delinquent
in my communication.

04:07.699 --> 04:09.199
Mm.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.168
Initially, it was because
I required solitude.

04:11.169 --> 04:13.137
Then...

04:13.138 --> 04:16.373
it became a habit.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.476
A deeply regrettable one.

04:30.321 --> 04:32.689
Is that what I think it is?

04:32.690 --> 04:34.424
Katrina's necklace.

04:34.425 --> 04:37.194
I'll admit I kept it out of sentiment.

04:37.195 --> 04:40.364
But this charm is spiritually linked

04:40.365 --> 04:42.366
to the soul of Abraham Van Brunt.

04:49.674 --> 04:52.309
Last night, something happened to it.

04:52.310 --> 04:57.247
I was in the midst of what has
become something of a ritual.

04:57.248 --> 05:00.083
A nighttime communion of sorts.

05:00.084 --> 05:02.186
And I return to the question

05:02.187 --> 05:06.190
that echoes through my soul.

05:06.191 --> 05:10.160
Is my destiny to be not
but a ceaseless traveler,

05:10.161 --> 05:12.763
inexorably slouching my way

05:12.764 --> 05:15.232
through this mortal coil?

05:17.202 --> 05:19.736
Can you hear me, Jesus?

05:21.806 --> 05:25.209
I hear you, C-Dawg.
Don't got no answers.

05:25.210 --> 05:28.212
But as a wise man once said:
"It's a hard knock life.

05:28.213 --> 05:30.080
For us."

05:30.081 --> 05:31.381
Mm-hmm.

05:31.382 --> 05:33.850
So true. That is so true.

05:34.552 --> 05:37.254
(grunting in pain)

05:37.255 --> 05:38.355
(gasps)

05:43.394 --> 05:46.263
The energy has been drained from it...
completely.

05:46.264 --> 05:50.100
I believe something has happened
to Abraham... something dire.

05:50.101 --> 05:52.870
Now, if something has happened
to the Horseman of Death,

05:52.871 --> 05:55.272
it means there are
dark forces in motion.

05:55.273 --> 05:56.607
First things first.

05:56.608 --> 05:58.308
I need to get you out of here.

05:58.309 --> 06:00.611
So tell me what you tried
to smuggle past Customs.

06:00.612 --> 06:03.013
An artifact.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.415
One of immeasurable significance.

06:05.416 --> 06:07.818
I believe it holds the key

06:07.819 --> 06:08.886
to our future as Witnesses,

06:08.887 --> 06:10.854
- Lieutenant.
- Agent.

06:10.855 --> 06:12.322
I'm not a Lieutenant anymore.

06:12.323 --> 06:14.691
I'm a special agent for the FBI.

06:14.692 --> 06:17.027
You joined the federal police.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.596
Like you said... lots of catching up.

06:19.597 --> 06:21.598
Want me to get that?

06:36.314 --> 06:37.447
Where's my package?

06:37.448 --> 06:38.749
You can file a claim for

06:38.750 --> 06:40.384
- seized items online.
- Now look here...

06:40.385 --> 06:41.919
the right to personal
property is a fundamental...

06:41.920 --> 06:43.387
Crane, I will make sure

06:43.388 --> 06:44.922
that you get your stuff back later.

06:44.923 --> 06:47.157
Right now, we just need to get
out of here. Thank you, sir.

06:47.158 --> 06:49.826
Very well. I leave my possession
here with these noble soles,

06:49.827 --> 06:51.428
my comrades.

06:51.429 --> 06:54.298
Thomas Paine described America as a place

06:54.299 --> 06:56.867
"where all parts are brought
into perfect unison."

06:56.868 --> 06:59.136
Indeed. Though my stay

06:59.137 --> 07:01.171
here has been brief,

07:01.172 --> 07:03.907
I have come to value the
concord I found with my fellow

07:03.908 --> 07:06.643
detainees.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.650
You want to stay with your new pals?

07:13.651 --> 07:15.685
Good God, no.

07:18.122 --> 07:19.756
MAN: (laughs) Told you!

07:19.757 --> 07:20.924
I can't miss.

07:20.925 --> 07:22.851
- Oh, dude, that was me.
- Oh, the hell it was.

07:22.852 --> 07:24.061
God, why do you got to be like that?

07:24.062 --> 07:25.257
Why does it always got to be you?

07:25.258 --> 07:26.763
Well, because you
couldn't hit an elephant

07:26.764 --> 07:28.131
if it was hugging you.

07:28.132 --> 07:29.933
Hey, that reminds me. How's Sally doing?

07:29.934 --> 07:31.168
(laughs)

07:32.103 --> 07:34.171
Yeah!

07:34.172 --> 07:35.439
(grunting)

07:35.440 --> 07:36.974
(laughing) Come on, man.

07:36.975 --> 07:39.109
- Come on. (laughs)
- (eerie growling)

07:39.110 --> 07:40.544
Hey, are you mad?

07:40.545 --> 07:41.945
Oh, screw you!

07:41.946 --> 07:43.313
(laughs)

07:43.314 --> 07:45.515
Oh, come on, man.
Don't be a tool.

07:45.516 --> 07:47.584
(monster growling, man screaming)

07:54.158 --> 07:57.694
Brent?

08:04.202 --> 08:06.503
(grunts)

08:06.504 --> 08:10.340
(gasps, whimpers)

08:10.341 --> 08:12.542
Aah! Brent! Brent!

08:12.543 --> 08:14.711
(footsteps thudding)

08:14.712 --> 08:17.214
(roaring)

08:20.952 --> 08:23.186
(growling)

08:23.187 --> 08:25.555
(hissing, growling)

08:27.792 --> 08:30.127
It was only then that I
gleaned what they meant

08:30.128 --> 08:32.562
by "return to your upright
and locked position."

08:32.563 --> 08:34.364
Crane on a plane!

08:34.365 --> 08:36.832
I miss everything.

08:38.535 --> 08:39.669
Lieutenant...

08:39.669 --> 08:41.004
- Agent.
- Agent.

08:41.005 --> 08:42.572
No. Yeah...

08:42.573 --> 08:45.275
On second thought, doesn't sound right.

08:45.276 --> 08:48.011
- Just stick with "lieutenant."
- Certain?

08:48.012 --> 08:50.380
I can only handle so much change.

08:50.381 --> 08:52.883
- What's all this?
- Yes. Agreed.

08:52.884 --> 08:54.885
(laughs)

08:54.886 --> 08:56.753
Crane, you really should
have called me sooner.

08:56.754 --> 08:59.189
- We are a team.
- But are we?

08:59.190 --> 09:03.360
We're friends, of
course, and colleagues,

09:03.361 --> 09:07.531
but "team" implies a mission; purpose.

09:07.532 --> 09:09.366
Henry and Katrina's deaths

09:09.367 --> 09:11.401
closed a chapter for us.

09:11.402 --> 09:13.437
And it reminded me,

09:13.438 --> 09:16.373
perhaps I am truly adrift in this time.

09:18.009 --> 09:20.377
Then it dawned on me.

09:20.378 --> 09:23.747
Perhaps there are other
descendants in the Crane line.

09:23.748 --> 09:25.082
Then I would not be alone.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.017
So, I traveled

09:27.018 --> 09:28.858
to my family ancestral home
in Scotland...

09:30.888 --> 09:34.090
<i>...where I made an astonishing discovery.</i>

10:02.687 --> 10:05.155
♪

10:08.159 --> 10:10.026
ABBIE: <i>A tablet?</i>

10:10.027 --> 10:12.095
That's what Customs nailed you for?

10:12.096 --> 10:14.931
"Improper import of cultural
heritage antiquities."

10:14.932 --> 10:17.634
A bureaucrat's flight of
fancy, if ever I heard one.

10:17.635 --> 10:20.137
Fortunately, before they
confiscated my property,

10:20.138 --> 10:22.639
I was able to decipher
some of its engraving.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.074
It was Sumerian.

10:24.075 --> 10:26.076
4,000 years old.

10:26.077 --> 10:28.178
Roughly translated, it said:

10:28.179 --> 10:32.182
<i>"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."</i>

10:32.183 --> 10:34.117
(laughs)

10:34.919 --> 10:36.753
Are you serious, Crane?

10:36.754 --> 10:39.723
Yes, I assure you, I am.

10:39.724 --> 10:41.892
Do you not see... this tablet...

10:41.893 --> 10:44.728
Let me guess. You think this
is an ancient prophecy about

10:44.729 --> 10:46.663
our place in the war
between good and evil?

10:46.664 --> 10:47.998
Shamans thousands of
years ago predicted

10:47.999 --> 10:49.733
what was gonna happen to us,

10:49.734 --> 10:52.936
and that this Babylonian artifact will

10:52.937 --> 10:56.072
hold the key to what we're
supposed to do with our lives.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.141
Am I right?

10:58.142 --> 11:00.944
Well, no, actually, you're not.

11:01.879 --> 11:03.680
It was Sumerian, not Babylonian.

11:03.681 --> 11:05.315
- Ah.
- Oh, d... all right, fine...

11:05.316 --> 11:06.816
that <i>is</i> what I believe, but...

11:06.817 --> 11:08.752
Lieutenant, do you not see?

11:08.753 --> 11:12.022
This tablet could hold the key
to our mission as Witnesses.

11:12.023 --> 11:14.024
Our mission? For all you know,

11:14.025 --> 11:15.025
this is Sumerian sudoku.

11:15.026 --> 11:18.328
Our mission is over.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.764
We stopped Moloch and the apocalypse.

11:20.765 --> 11:22.732
(phone rings) Mills.

11:22.733 --> 11:24.267
DISPATCHER: Agent
Mills, we have a report

11:24.268 --> 11:26.136
of two dead bodies in
Westchester National Park.

11:26.137 --> 11:28.605
Local authorities are
requesting federal assistance

11:28.606 --> 11:30.607
due to jurisdictional issues.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.242
Copy that. I'm on my way.

11:32.243 --> 11:34.044
(hangs up)

11:34.045 --> 11:36.179
I have a new mission now.

11:37.648 --> 11:39.849
I'm an agent of the FBI.

11:48.593 --> 11:50.794
Working theory is animal attack.

11:50.795 --> 11:53.964
But the thing is, I know this area.

11:53.965 --> 11:57.534
And there aren't any
predators around here.

11:57.535 --> 11:59.669
(indistinct police radio communication)

12:18.789 --> 12:20.624
Blood?

12:20.625 --> 12:22.092
I don't think so.

12:22.093 --> 12:24.628
It looks like some kind of residue.

12:24.629 --> 12:26.463
As if something brushed up against it.

12:26.464 --> 12:29.265
Can you take a sample of this?

13:01.132 --> 13:03.833
- What is it?
- Certainly not human.

13:03.834 --> 13:07.637
Nor any animal I know of.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.875
Dragon's Breath.

13:11.876 --> 13:13.710
Something I obtained on my travels.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.679
Or something you picked up in duty-free.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.480
(mutters)

13:17.481 --> 13:19.015
It was used by the Dominican Order

13:19.016 --> 13:20.483
during the Spanish Inquisition

13:20.484 --> 13:22.118
to test for demonic activity.

13:22.119 --> 13:26.422
If demons are present, it should...
heat up a little.

13:32.063 --> 13:35.098
Well, perhaps... we should
try something different.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.200
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

13:40.938 --> 13:44.007
Evil has returned

13:44.008 --> 13:46.209
to Sleepy Hollow.

14:17.663 --> 14:21.593
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

14:23.437 --> 14:25.335
Very impressive.

14:26.014 --> 14:29.584
Certainly a step up from
the sheriff's department.

14:29.585 --> 14:32.286
Step I've been meaning
to take for a while.

14:35.724 --> 14:37.525
Lieutenant...

14:40.629 --> 14:42.130
Look, Crane...

14:42.131 --> 14:44.465
I never faulted you for leaving.

14:44.466 --> 14:48.136
It was something you had to do.
After you left, I realized

14:48.137 --> 14:50.071
that I couldn't put my life on hold.

14:50.072 --> 14:52.240
You know, before the Horseman
and all the other craziness,

14:52.241 --> 14:53.245
I had a plan. I was

14:53.246 --> 14:54.380
on my way to Quantico

14:54.381 --> 14:56.382
and I'm finally back on that path.

14:56.383 --> 15:00.319
And this... this feels good.

15:05.192 --> 15:07.393
- Anaconda.
- Mm.

15:07.394 --> 15:10.129
A multi-state drug trafficking ring.

15:10.130 --> 15:11.397
The boss, Lorenzo Chang,

15:11.398 --> 15:13.499
has evaded capture for years.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.536
But we just got word of a
meet he'll be at tomorrow.

15:15.537 --> 15:17.436
So you've moved on
to taking down monsters

15:17.437 --> 15:18.504
of a different variety.

15:18.505 --> 15:20.105
You could say that.

15:20.106 --> 15:21.907
Mills. My office in ten.

15:21.908 --> 15:23.576
And grab the rest of the
Anaconda task force.

15:23.577 --> 15:26.011
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.246
This is Ichabod Crane.

15:27.247 --> 15:29.915
Crane, this is Special Agent
in Charge Mitch Granger.

15:29.916 --> 15:31.250
At your service.

15:31.251 --> 15:33.452
Uh-huh.

15:34.454 --> 15:35.955
Ten minutes.

15:35.956 --> 15:37.389
Yes, sir.

15:38.925 --> 15:39.959
- Charming.
- I like him.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.927
He busts my chops,

15:41.928 --> 15:44.129
but he's a good agent.

15:44.130 --> 15:47.132
Lieutenant, far be it from
me to stand in the way

15:47.133 --> 15:49.168
of your professional endeavors, but...

15:49.169 --> 15:51.170
there is a far greater role for us.

15:51.171 --> 15:53.172
A fact proven by my recent discovery.

15:53.173 --> 15:54.640
Has it ever occurred to you that

15:54.641 --> 15:56.442
you went looking for your purpose

15:56.443 --> 15:57.610
and conveniently found one?

15:57.611 --> 15:58.811
I did not invent the tablet.

15:58.812 --> 16:00.946
No, but you know as well as I do

16:00.947 --> 16:02.948
that translating ancient
languages is hit-or-miss.

16:02.949 --> 16:04.750
You wanted it to be important,

16:04.751 --> 16:06.085
and have meaning, so it did.

16:06.086 --> 16:07.386
Lieutenant, the Bible foretells

16:07.387 --> 16:09.121
that the two Witnesses must endure

16:09.122 --> 16:10.689
seven tribulations.

16:10.690 --> 16:13.058
The first ended with
the death of Moloch.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.261
This new... evil may mark

16:15.262 --> 16:17.563
- the beginning of the second.
- I agree

16:17.564 --> 16:19.732
something weird was
involved with the hunters.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.600
Maybe a... stray monster.

16:21.601 --> 16:23.002
Didn't get the "war's over" memo.

16:23.003 --> 16:26.071
Or maybe those guys are mixed
up in some dark occult thing.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.007
I don't know. I'm gonna help
you get to the bottom of it,

16:28.008 --> 16:30.009
but the idea that this
is the apocalypse 2.0...

16:30.010 --> 16:31.443
- (door opens)
- WOMAN: Agent Mills?

16:31.444 --> 16:32.978
Here are the forensics
on the dead hunters.

16:32.979 --> 16:35.180
Thank you, Dani.

16:38.251 --> 16:41.253
"Elevated levels of ACTH."

16:41.254 --> 16:43.789
What is that?

16:46.526 --> 16:47.660
Dani.

16:47.661 --> 16:49.161
Huh? Oh, sorry.

16:49.162 --> 16:51.196
Um, ACTH is a hormone secreted

16:51.197 --> 16:52.865
by the pituitary during
moments of terror.

16:52.866 --> 16:55.134
Yeah, see? Both of the
victims' fists were clenched

16:55.135 --> 16:58.170
and locked... literally frozen in fear.

16:58.171 --> 16:59.238
There you go.

16:59.239 --> 17:00.639
And the red substance?

17:00.640 --> 17:02.641
Oh, we're still working on the analysis.

17:02.642 --> 17:04.609
Thanks, Dani.

17:10.983 --> 17:12.785
Despite what I'm certain

17:12.786 --> 17:14.853
is excellent work on Miss Dani's part,

17:14.854 --> 17:17.589
science will only take us so far.

17:17.590 --> 17:20.459
We need to tap into information

17:20.460 --> 17:23.194
of a less terrestrial nature.

17:23.195 --> 17:26.165
(door creaking open)

17:26.165 --> 17:28.367
Welcome back to the archives, Crane.

17:46.820 --> 17:48.821
- What happened?
- The city

17:48.822 --> 17:50.489
sold the building to developers.

17:50.490 --> 17:53.525
It's scheduled for demolition next month.

17:53.526 --> 17:55.282
I've been in here packing
up stuff for weeks.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.156
Demolition?

17:56.157 --> 17:57.096
Mm.

17:57.097 --> 17:59.698
This chamber has stood since the 1750s!

17:59.699 --> 18:01.700
The... Battle of Lexington

18:01.701 --> 18:03.869
was plotted right here.

18:05.071 --> 18:06.572
Now it'll be a mini mall.

18:06.573 --> 18:08.774
A mini mall...

18:10.143 --> 18:12.578
Is there no regard for the past?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.081
And...

18:16.082 --> 18:17.216
What are these?

18:17.217 --> 18:19.485
JENNY: Reminders. Of an old friend.

18:19.486 --> 18:21.487
Don't tell me you've
forgotten your old friends.

18:21.488 --> 18:22.721
Miss Jenny.

18:22.722 --> 18:24.156
Hey, stranger.

18:24.157 --> 18:25.224
Oh!

18:25.225 --> 18:27.092
(chuckles gently)

18:27.093 --> 18:29.161
Abby told me you were in town.

18:29.162 --> 18:30.195
Had to come see for myself.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.664
And Captain Irving?

18:31.665 --> 18:33.265
Up and left in the middle of the night.

18:33.266 --> 18:34.166
He said it was the best way

18:34.167 --> 18:37.202
to protect his family.
No word, no warning.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.370
Like witness protection.

18:38.371 --> 18:41.139
You have no idea where he's gone?

18:42.308 --> 18:43.709
No.

18:43.710 --> 18:47.212
But someone probably helped him leave.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.148
Someone who knows

18:49.149 --> 18:51.150
how to get in and out
of countries quietly.

18:51.151 --> 18:53.318
Someone who's been
getting around the law

18:53.319 --> 18:55.220
ever since she was young.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.157
Someone who's said good-bye
to too many friends.

18:58.158 --> 19:00.159
ABBIE: So...

19:00.160 --> 19:02.227
what exactly are we looking for?

19:02.228 --> 19:03.262
Ah.

19:03.263 --> 19:05.497
The bestiary texts.

19:05.498 --> 19:08.534
Preferably <i>Voynich
or Codex Serafini.</i>

19:08.535 --> 19:11.637
Any that catalog mythological creatures.

19:11.638 --> 19:13.638
- You're looking for a demon?
- Indeed we are.

19:14.741 --> 19:16.141
Specifically one

19:16.142 --> 19:18.110
that can manipulate fear.

19:20.113 --> 19:22.481
WOMAN: <i>One for sorrow,</i>

19:22.482 --> 19:24.149
two for mirth.

19:24.150 --> 19:26.085
Three for a wedding,

19:26.086 --> 19:28.320
and four for a birth.

19:30.123 --> 19:33.258
Five for silver, six for gold.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.728
Seven for a secret...

19:35.729 --> 19:38.363
not to be told.

19:39.265 --> 19:42.334
- So afraid.
- (no voice)

19:42.335 --> 19:45.037
And yet, they have no idea...

19:45.038 --> 19:47.506
just how powerful their fear can be.

19:47.507 --> 19:49.341
But I know.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.812
And I want more.

20:16.569 --> 20:18.770
(computer beeps)

20:22.442 --> 20:25.043
Ah. It's the lab report.

20:25.044 --> 20:27.112
So that red substance is mercury sulfide.

20:27.113 --> 20:29.214
Commonly known as cinnabar.

20:29.215 --> 20:31.049
Cinnabar.

20:31.050 --> 20:32.885
JENNY: Cinnabar used to
be used as a pigment

20:32.886 --> 20:34.253
in supernatural artifacts.

20:34.254 --> 20:36.421
CRANE: The hides of certain demons

20:36.422 --> 20:39.358
are believed to contain high levels of it.

20:39.359 --> 20:40.592
Ah.

20:40.593 --> 20:43.262
Demons including Yao-guai.

20:43.263 --> 20:46.498
A creature dating back
to the Tang dynasty.

20:46.499 --> 20:49.301
Here: "Known as battlefield demons.

20:49.302 --> 20:51.336
"Drawn to the frenzy and energy

20:51.337 --> 20:52.838
"of armed conflict.

20:52.839 --> 20:54.306
"Most notably, they have the power

20:54.307 --> 20:56.975
to paralyze their victims with fear."

20:56.976 --> 20:58.410
Battlefield demon?

20:58.411 --> 20:59.719
What's it doing in Sleepy Hollow?

20:59.720 --> 21:00.972
Could it have killed Abraham?

21:00.973 --> 21:01.880
These demons are known

21:01.881 --> 21:03.916
to be servants, not masters.

21:03.917 --> 21:06.385
JENNY: Meaning that
someone summoned it here.

21:06.386 --> 21:08.120
Someone evil.

21:08.121 --> 21:10.255
Someone powerful.

21:10.256 --> 21:13.058
There is a new player in town.

21:23.141 --> 21:25.009
Benjamin Franklin's sketchbook.

21:25.010 --> 21:28.078
Franklin wrote of the survivors
of a particular battle

21:28.079 --> 21:31.782
and their report
of a horrific encounter

21:31.783 --> 21:33.284
with a red devil.

21:33.285 --> 21:35.686
I always assumed the
term was a pejorative

21:35.687 --> 21:36.820
for the British Red Coats.

21:36.821 --> 21:38.355
Apparently, it was meant literally.

21:38.356 --> 21:39.590
Which battle?

21:39.591 --> 21:41.659
The battle of Bunker Hill.

21:41.660 --> 21:44.862
Fire on my ready... fire!

21:44.863 --> 21:47.865
CRANE: <i>In the early going,
Colonial losses at Bunker Hill</i>

21:47.866 --> 21:49.833
<i>were extremely heavy.</i>

21:49.834 --> 21:51.902
<i>According to Franklin, it wasn't</i>

21:51.903 --> 21:53.737
<i>just due to British firepower.</i>

21:53.738 --> 21:55.038
(growling, snarling)

21:56.908 --> 21:58.642
(snarling)

22:08.587 --> 22:11.488
You think a Yao-guai was
present at Bunker Hill?

22:11.489 --> 22:13.958
- It would explain the accounts.
- ABBIE: Colonial soldiers

22:13.959 --> 22:15.826
found a way to turn the
early tide of the battle.

22:15.827 --> 22:17.828
But their fortunes only turned
after General Washington

22:17.829 --> 22:19.997
was able to get a message
to Colonel Prescott,

22:19.998 --> 22:22.199
who was leading the American troops.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.869
This message must contain the
key to defeating the Yao-guai.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.946
Do Franklin's notes say
what was in the message?

22:27.947 --> 22:28.639
No.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.708
They were top secret.

22:30.709 --> 22:32.209
Which is why Washington
had it delivered

22:32.210 --> 22:34.211
by his most trusted operative...

22:34.879 --> 22:36.213
(man whistles loudly)

22:37.983 --> 22:40.684
<i>...an agent highly skilled
in combat and evasion...</i>

22:40.685 --> 22:42.853
(shouting, grunting)

22:44.522 --> 22:46.890
<i>...one who singlehandedly</i>

22:46.891 --> 22:48.959
<i>penetrated the British front line.</i>

22:50.662 --> 22:53.182
(horses neighing, men shouting,
cannon booming in distance)

22:53.665 --> 22:55.866
<i>Her name</i>

22:55.867 --> 22:57.568
<i>was Betsy Ross.</i>

22:57.569 --> 22:58.836
Betsy Ross?

22:58.837 --> 23:00.070
The flag woman?

23:00.071 --> 23:03.907
Betsy was a little more
than just "the flag woman."

23:03.908 --> 23:07.645
Her role as a seamstress was a cover.

23:07.646 --> 23:10.214
Betsy was a woman of many talents.

23:10.215 --> 23:13.050
So we've heard. Betsy and Crane

23:13.051 --> 23:14.852
- kind of were a thing.
- We were not

23:14.853 --> 23:15.919
a "thing."

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
She was my colleague,

23:16.921 --> 23:17.921
my compatriot,

23:17.922 --> 23:20.024
my partner.

23:20.025 --> 23:22.493
Often in crime.

23:22.494 --> 23:24.061
Mm-hmm. Sounds like a thing.

23:24.062 --> 23:25.729
- A thing.
- Yeah.

23:25.730 --> 23:27.998
There may have been moments.

23:27.999 --> 23:29.633
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:33.772 --> 23:36.173
Any further, we risk detection.

23:37.976 --> 23:39.977
This will do.

23:39.978 --> 23:43.113
(distant gun and cannon fire)

23:43.114 --> 23:44.381
The battle grows.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.716
Perhaps you should wait.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.751
The longer I wait, the more men die.

23:47.752 --> 23:49.119
And more shall fall if you die.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.188
Why, Ichabod...

23:52.223 --> 23:53.724
- ...are you worried about me?
- Of course.

23:53.725 --> 23:54.958
General Washington said

23:54.959 --> 23:56.627
this mission is of the utmost importance.

23:56.628 --> 23:58.062
Such sweet talk.

23:58.063 --> 24:00.064
You do know how to melt a lady's heart.

24:00.065 --> 24:03.934
- Uh, uh, well, I meant that...
- I know what you meant.

24:03.935 --> 24:06.136
The ever-proper Mr. Ichabod Crane.

24:06.137 --> 24:09.073
Someday, some woman will make
you forget all those manners,

24:09.074 --> 24:10.808
cause you to do something impulsive.

24:10.809 --> 24:12.809
I just hope I'm there to see it.

24:13.611 --> 24:15.612
(clears throat)

24:15.613 --> 24:17.081
Time to go.

24:17.082 --> 24:18.549
Men's lives are depending

24:18.550 --> 24:19.816
on the contents within.

24:37.969 --> 24:40.170
For luck.

24:44.008 --> 24:45.008
Smooth...

24:45.009 --> 24:46.543
Hardly.

24:46.544 --> 24:48.045
The point is, we must find out what

24:48.046 --> 24:49.646
was in the message Betsy carried.

24:49.647 --> 24:53.050
Unfortunately, very few
artifacts survived Bunker Hill.

24:53.051 --> 24:55.686
Okay. So we can start
in the National Archives.

24:55.687 --> 24:57.955
- With my FBI clearance, we should...
- Got it.

24:57.956 --> 24:59.490
Pardon?

24:59.491 --> 25:00.791
I found the message.

25:00.792 --> 25:03.827
I spent years recovering
obscure artifacts

25:03.828 --> 25:06.497
from all over the world.
This is what I do.

25:06.498 --> 25:09.099
Okay, so as far as I
can tell, the message

25:09.100 --> 25:10.968
and that satchel ended up as part

25:10.969 --> 25:13.003
of Colonel Prescott's estate.
They were passed down

25:13.004 --> 25:15.139
from owner to owner, until
eventually being sold

25:15.140 --> 25:18.108
to an entertainment franchise company.

25:18.109 --> 25:19.209
Huh.

25:19.210 --> 25:21.178
It's in Colonial Times.

25:21.179 --> 25:23.147
(groans) We need it in the here and now.

25:23.148 --> 25:26.483
No, no. I mean it's
actually in Colonial Times.

25:30.688 --> 25:33.256
♪

25:39.230 --> 25:43.000
The deeds of so many
brave men and women,

25:43.001 --> 25:46.036
signposts of history,

25:46.037 --> 25:51.108
reminders of our hardship
and the ultimate sacrifice...

25:51.109 --> 25:52.876
They've taken it

25:52.877 --> 25:56.513
and used it to decorate an eatery.

25:56.514 --> 25:59.016
They also have mini golf out back.

25:59.017 --> 26:02.886
Welcome to Ye Olde Colonial Times!

26:02.887 --> 26:04.655
Hath thou dinest with us before?

26:04.656 --> 26:06.056
Why are you talking like that?

26:06.057 --> 26:07.558
It be how we spoketh in days of yore.

26:07.559 --> 26:09.560
If you're wounded in the head, perhaps.

26:09.561 --> 26:11.228
We're just gonna take a little look

26:11.229 --> 26:12.195
around.

26:14.499 --> 26:17.501
The corner goes at the front.

26:17.502 --> 26:19.703
You're not a pirate.

26:23.708 --> 26:26.910
(groans)

26:26.911 --> 26:30.280
Huh. "Spaghetti and Musketballs.

26:30.281 --> 26:32.449
"Cannot Tell a Lie

26:32.450 --> 26:33.851
"Cherry Pie.

26:33.852 --> 26:35.919
Eggs Benedict Arnold."

26:35.920 --> 26:38.956
For shame, for shame.

26:38.957 --> 26:40.858
This is exactly how you
remember it, right?

26:40.859 --> 26:42.259
Exactly how I...

26:43.728 --> 26:46.964
- Very funny.
- Come on, Crane.

26:46.965 --> 26:48.866
At least they're keeping
the Founding Fathers alive

26:48.867 --> 26:50.234
in people's memories.

26:50.235 --> 26:51.802
Yes, and using it to line their pockets.

26:51.803 --> 26:54.371
Crane, look.

27:04.616 --> 27:06.283
- (quietly): Is that it?
- (whispers): That's it.

27:06.284 --> 27:08.819
Stand guard.

27:18.363 --> 27:20.964
Mmm. At least they got something right.

27:20.965 --> 27:23.066
Let's go.

27:23.067 --> 27:25.102
You realize this is stealing.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.337
We'll return it. If it
makes you feel so bad,

27:27.338 --> 27:29.573
buy something.

27:29.574 --> 27:31.975
Unbelievable.

27:40.018 --> 27:42.352
Very clever, Betsy.

27:42.353 --> 27:46.023
A John Jay cipher, if I'm not mistaken.

27:46.024 --> 27:47.024
I'll be able to decode it.

27:47.025 --> 27:48.992
Just need a moment.

27:48.993 --> 27:50.994
You want to work on it at the archives?
I can drop you off.

27:50.995 --> 27:52.629
Anaconda.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.264
We take down the drug operation today.

27:54.265 --> 27:56.166
Ah. Yes.

27:56.167 --> 27:57.801
There's a lot of evil in the world, Crane.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.962
- (starts engine)
- Not all of it is supernatural.

28:21.626 --> 28:23.026
Ma'am?

28:23.027 --> 28:24.795
Is everything all right?

28:24.796 --> 28:26.697
Yes.

28:26.698 --> 28:27.698
Where you going?

28:27.699 --> 28:29.333
That settlement, over the rise.

28:29.334 --> 28:32.369
- How far is it?
- Settlement?

28:32.370 --> 28:34.604
Do you mean...

28:39.377 --> 28:41.078
Um...

28:41.079 --> 28:43.380
What were you asking?

28:43.381 --> 28:45.415
You know what? That's all right.
I feel like walking.

28:45.416 --> 28:47.884
It's a good five miles to town.
It may take a while.

28:47.885 --> 28:51.788
It has taken me a very long
time to get here already.

28:56.494 --> 28:59.563
A lifetime, really.

29:35.052 --> 29:36.719
Miss Jenny.

29:36.720 --> 29:40.256
Good. I've decoded much
of Betsy's message,

29:40.257 --> 29:43.325
but I may require some
assistance interpreting it.

29:43.326 --> 29:45.828
Oh! Unless I'm interrupting.

29:45.829 --> 29:50.332
Oh, no, no, no, just...
memory lane-ING it.

29:50.333 --> 29:52.234
I'm realizing something.

29:52.235 --> 29:54.703
I stole <i>a lot</i> of stuff.

29:54.704 --> 29:56.605
It's too bad "supernatural
relic hunter" isn't something

29:56.606 --> 29:59.542
that looks good on a résumé.

29:59.543 --> 30:02.244
- You've sought gainful employment.
- Employment, yes. Gainful,

30:02.245 --> 30:05.114
not so much. Unless you
count those office supplies

30:05.115 --> 30:08.250
- I swiped during my week as a paralegal.
- Finding a role

30:08.251 --> 30:10.753
and purpose in this world
has rather occupied

30:10.754 --> 30:12.388
my thoughts, as well.

30:12.389 --> 30:14.290
It's good to have you back, Crane.

30:14.291 --> 30:16.492
Now you and I can <i>not </i> fit in together.

30:18.395 --> 30:19.728
Anyway, let's see what you got.

30:19.729 --> 30:21.263
Ah, yes.

30:21.264 --> 30:24.333
The message concerns the
nature of the Yao-guai.

30:24.334 --> 30:26.802
Apparently, it is attracted

30:26.803 --> 30:30.473
by two things: The first
trigger is aggression.

30:30.474 --> 30:32.975
It senses aggression the
way a dog senses fear.

30:32.976 --> 30:35.778
The second trigger seems to be gunpowder.

30:35.779 --> 30:37.780
Perhaps drawn by the scent?

30:37.781 --> 30:40.416
You said this thing was created
during the Tang dynasty, right?

30:40.417 --> 30:43.552
- Yes.
- That's when gunpowder was invented.

30:43.553 --> 30:45.187
Chinese alchemists were searching

30:45.188 --> 30:46.506
for the elixir of life, instead,

30:46.507 --> 30:48.257
they accidentally created gunpowder.

30:48.258 --> 30:49.859
So, if this beast was
summoned during this process,

30:49.860 --> 30:51.293
it would naturally be drawn to it.

30:51.294 --> 30:52.361
Damn straight.

30:52.362 --> 30:54.363
Let's see a paralegal do that.

30:54.364 --> 30:55.965
Exactly.

30:55.966 --> 30:57.800
I have no idea what a paralegal is.

30:57.801 --> 30:59.768
Me, neither.

30:59.769 --> 31:01.604
Where's Abbie?

31:01.605 --> 31:03.405
She and her FBI colleagues

31:03.406 --> 31:06.408
have set out to ensnare
an underworld Mandarin.

31:06.409 --> 31:09.478
You're saying a bunch of angry people

31:09.479 --> 31:11.514
with guns are gonna be bumping heads

31:11.515 --> 31:14.316
with a lot of other
angry people with guns?

31:14.317 --> 31:16.352
In other words, perfect conditions

31:16.353 --> 31:18.387
for a Yao-guai attack.

31:18.388 --> 31:20.156
AGENT: Move! Move!

31:20.157 --> 31:23.425
All units sound off once
you've cleared your floors.

31:25.729 --> 31:26.595
Sir.

31:32.669 --> 31:33.969
(Yao-guai snarling)

31:33.970 --> 31:35.571
Stay here. Cover the door.

31:37.174 --> 31:38.374
(distant gunfire)

31:38.375 --> 31:40.342
(snarling)

31:40.343 --> 31:43.379
(automatic gunfire)

31:43.380 --> 31:45.414
(distant gunfire)

31:45.415 --> 31:48.517
(growling)

31:50.887 --> 31:53.655
No. Granger.

31:56.393 --> 31:57.426
Freeze!

31:58.395 --> 32:00.396
Turn around, slowly!

32:00.397 --> 32:03.399
Slowly.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.834
(snarling)

32:08.171 --> 32:09.371
(Yao-guai hisses)

32:19.883 --> 32:22.251
(gasps)

32:22.252 --> 32:24.453
(choking)

32:27.257 --> 32:30.125
(roars)

32:30.126 --> 32:31.627
(snarling)

32:31.628 --> 32:33.228
Sir...

32:36.299 --> 32:37.499
- Sir!
- (choking)

32:38.268 --> 32:39.735
Agent down! Repeat!

32:39.736 --> 32:41.437
We have an agent down!

32:41.438 --> 32:43.439
Stay with me. Stay with me, sir.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.274
Sir, sir. Stay with me.

32:45.275 --> 32:47.443
Sir.

32:51.204 --> 32:54.452
The FBI had launched a
massive manhunt for Chang.

32:54.453 --> 32:56.454
They've pinned Granger's death on him.

32:56.455 --> 32:59.290
How were you able to drive it away?

32:59.291 --> 33:01.259
It attacked, I shot and wounded it.

33:01.260 --> 33:02.927
- You wounded it?
- Yeah.

33:02.928 --> 33:04.736
The Yao-guai's hide is
supposed to be impenetrable.

33:04.737 --> 33:07.265
Unless you somehow found
its vulnerability.

33:07.266 --> 33:08.432
(sighs)

33:08.433 --> 33:10.868
(roaring, moaning)

33:10.869 --> 33:14.705
Its eyes turned white when
it attacked, like a shark's.

33:14.706 --> 33:17.475
White eyes...

33:18.310 --> 33:20.444
Of course.

33:20.445 --> 33:23.948
That explains the order
Washington told Prescott

33:23.949 --> 33:25.483
to deliver to his men.

33:25.484 --> 33:27.852
(distant yelling)

33:27.853 --> 33:30.788
Don't fire until you the
whites of their eyes.

33:30.789 --> 33:32.523
(Yao-guai growling)

33:32.524 --> 33:34.492
- That's what that means?
- Prescott was letting his men know

33:34.493 --> 33:37.795
- when the monster was vulnerable.
- It's a narrow window.

33:37.796 --> 33:39.363
Couldn't have been more
than a few seconds.

33:39.364 --> 33:41.499
It requires a coordinated attack.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.167
When the Yao-guai goes after one person,

33:43.168 --> 33:44.702
another watches its eyes
and prepares to fire.

33:44.703 --> 33:46.737
It requires teamwork.

33:47.973 --> 33:49.540
(phone ringing)

33:49.541 --> 33:50.474
(Abbie sighs, groans)

33:50.475 --> 33:52.710
Mills.

33:52.711 --> 33:54.478
What?

33:54.479 --> 33:55.913
Yeah. No. I got it.

33:55.914 --> 33:58.282
I'll be right there.

33:58.283 --> 33:59.550
They found Chang.

33:59.551 --> 34:02.119
He's holed up at a
warehouse at Port Chester.

34:02.120 --> 34:05.089
He's got hostages, and
they're asking for me.

34:05.090 --> 34:06.524
- A standoff?
- Uh-huh.

34:06.525 --> 34:08.326
If that escalates, it'll be
catnip for the Yao-guai.

34:08.327 --> 34:11.161
Go. We'll follow close behind
with a plan of attack.

34:11.163 --> 34:13.464
You keep me posted?

34:13.465 --> 34:15.498
Miss Jenny?

34:15.500 --> 34:16.701
Guns, knives, things that go boom.

34:16.702 --> 34:18.869
We're back in the demon-fighting business,

34:18.870 --> 34:20.137
we're gonna need 'em.

34:22.873 --> 34:25.443
We got the place surrounded,
but he has four hostages.

34:25.444 --> 34:27.011
And he wants to talk to you.

34:27.012 --> 34:28.545
Says he'll only deal with the agent

34:28.547 --> 34:30.380
that was there when Granger went down.

34:30.382 --> 34:32.350
This guy's got some kind
of personal vendetta.

34:32.351 --> 34:34.351
You're walking into a death trap.

34:34.353 --> 34:36.554
I don't really have a choice, do I?

34:38.056 --> 34:40.623
(distant shouting)

34:42.594 --> 34:44.728
CRANE: Aggression levels
are running high.

34:44.730 --> 34:46.429
There's been no gunfire.

34:46.431 --> 34:49.367
That's why I brought bait.

34:49.368 --> 34:50.400
JENNY: Gunpowder.

34:50.402 --> 34:52.370
Can't catch a shark

34:52.371 --> 34:54.772
without chumming the water.

34:54.773 --> 34:55.973
Lorenzo.

34:58.510 --> 35:00.211
It's Agent Abbie Mills.

35:00.212 --> 35:02.613
- I'm coming in.
- You.

35:02.614 --> 35:05.182
You were the one there with me,

35:05.183 --> 35:06.517
with that thing?

35:06.518 --> 35:08.419
- Yes, I was.
- Then you know

35:08.420 --> 35:09.854
I didn't kill that guy!

35:09.855 --> 35:11.656
And I'll tell everyone about it

35:11.657 --> 35:13.424
once you let these people go.

35:13.425 --> 35:17.395
You don't give a damn about the truth!

35:17.396 --> 35:19.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:19.031 --> 35:21.198
All right, all right, Lorenzo...

35:21.199 --> 35:22.533
yes...

35:22.534 --> 35:24.602
I saw the monster.

35:24.603 --> 35:26.404
And it's a nasty one.

35:26.405 --> 35:28.439
I know that because

35:28.440 --> 35:32.043
I have seen demons, witches, ghosts,

35:32.044 --> 35:34.612
even the Horsemen of the
Apocalypse... I've seen 'em all.

35:34.613 --> 35:36.447
And I know how you feel.

35:36.448 --> 35:39.550
I'd rather they weren't real, either.

35:39.551 --> 35:41.619
It would've made my life
a whole lot easier.

35:43.288 --> 35:45.589
Lorenzo, the monsters are real.

35:45.590 --> 35:49.660
But it's okay, because...
it's my job to stop them.

35:51.430 --> 35:53.831
I'm a Witness...

35:53.832 --> 35:55.766
and that is my mission.

35:57.569 --> 36:00.237
(Chang sobbing)

36:02.741 --> 36:05.409
You bitch!

36:10.749 --> 36:14.485
There.

36:14.486 --> 36:16.820
(growling)

36:19.491 --> 36:21.692
(hissing)

36:28.567 --> 36:29.567
CRANE: It's not working.

36:29.568 --> 36:31.769
We need to draw it away from there.

36:32.304 --> 36:33.771
(growls)

36:34.673 --> 36:37.675
(roaring, growling)

36:37.676 --> 36:38.709
Well, that worked.

36:39.745 --> 36:42.012
(Yao-guai growling)

36:54.459 --> 36:56.627
Right... I'll draw the monster near.

36:56.628 --> 36:58.429
You take the shot.

36:58.430 --> 37:00.097
Remember... do not fire until you see...

37:00.098 --> 37:02.700
The whites of its eyes. Got it.

37:12.511 --> 37:15.012
(steam hissing)

37:15.013 --> 37:17.348
(Chang groaning)

37:20.385 --> 37:23.154
Hold your fire!

37:23.155 --> 37:24.388
(groaning)

37:26.525 --> 37:29.159
Nice work.

37:30.896 --> 37:32.530
(growls)

37:32.531 --> 37:34.698
(Yao-guai huffing)

37:37.536 --> 37:39.703
(growls)

37:40.639 --> 37:42.773
(roaring)

37:46.178 --> 37:47.611
(inhales quietly)

37:49.214 --> 37:51.015
(huffing)

37:52.684 --> 37:56.487
(growling)

38:01.860 --> 38:03.360
(growling)

38:03.361 --> 38:04.995
(Jenny groans)

38:04.996 --> 38:07.398
- (growls)
- CRANE: Miss Jenny!

38:19.177 --> 38:21.312
(Yao-guai roaring)

38:21.313 --> 38:22.513
(growling)

38:22.514 --> 38:23.414
(gunshots)

38:23.415 --> 38:25.616
(Crane gasping)

38:31.423 --> 38:33.724
(sighs)

38:40.398 --> 38:42.566
(sighs)

38:46.605 --> 38:48.138
Are you okay?

38:48.139 --> 38:49.373
Yes. Yes.

38:49.374 --> 38:53.644
Thank you for... that.

38:54.713 --> 38:56.680
(Abbie chuckles)

38:57.549 --> 38:59.216
Welcome back, Crane.

39:01.253 --> 39:03.587
Welcome back, Lieutenant.

39:11.344 --> 39:14.835
How did you persuade the
self-involved Magistrates

39:14.836 --> 39:16.663
of Immigration and Customs Enforcement

39:16.664 --> 39:17.906
to return my property?

39:17.923 --> 39:19.490
It's one of the perks of the job.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.960
I can also sic the IRS
on someone, if you want.

39:21.961 --> 39:24.996
Now, this is precisely the abuse
of centralized federal power

39:24.997 --> 39:26.764
that Thomas Jefferson warned against.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.400
- Do you want your stuff or not?
- Yes... please.

39:31.070 --> 39:34.239
Ah.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.207
Thank you.

39:39.011 --> 39:40.812
ABBIE: Mm.

39:40.813 --> 39:42.847
Magnificent, isn't it?

39:44.049 --> 39:46.017
What's this?

39:46.018 --> 39:48.086
Here along the edge...

39:48.087 --> 39:50.421
Looks like a...

39:50.422 --> 39:52.457
another piece.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.097
Those guys look kind of like you two.

39:59.098 --> 40:00.598
(officer chuckles)

40:03.068 --> 40:05.103
What is this?

40:05.104 --> 40:07.538
This is actually a single word.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.274
Perplexing to translate.

40:09.275 --> 40:13.144
It's actually closer to
Akkadian than Sumerian, and

40:13.145 --> 40:15.079
allowing for discrepancies
in regional dialects...

40:15.080 --> 40:17.282
Crane...

40:17.283 --> 40:19.117
It means "destroyers."

40:19.118 --> 40:20.318
Meaning what? Destroyers of what?

40:20.319 --> 40:22.287
An excellent question.

40:22.288 --> 40:23.621
You don't still think

40:23.622 --> 40:25.556
this is some kind of prophecy, do you?

40:25.557 --> 40:27.825
I mean, look, this can't be us, right?

40:27.826 --> 40:29.627
I have no answers, Lieutenant.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.297
Merely an inkling... one that tells me

40:32.298 --> 40:34.465
this tablet means something.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.100
Something important.

40:36.101 --> 40:40.204
And... and our work is not complete.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.873
Well, I suppose you're right about that.

40:41.874 --> 40:43.474
For one thing, we don't know

40:43.475 --> 40:45.677
who killed the Horseman, or
who summoned the Yao-guai.

40:45.678 --> 40:48.112
Am I to take it you agree

40:48.113 --> 40:50.181
the second Tribulation has begun?

40:50.182 --> 40:52.884
Maybe. Maybe not.

40:52.885 --> 40:54.319
Someone's got to keep
you out of trouble.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.487
JENNY: Here we go.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.323
- On the house.
- Thank you.

40:58.324 --> 41:00.959
You keep giving us free drinks,
you're gonna be out of a job.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.460
Ah, Mike doesn't care.

41:02.461 --> 41:04.295
Or he wouldn't, if he knew.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.632
Wow. Crane does not seem to mind.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.500
(exhales with satisfaction)

41:09.501 --> 41:12.103
I would never have believed

41:12.104 --> 41:14.138
that blueberry stout would work.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.819
Well, looks like I'm getting refills.

41:16.942 --> 41:19.544
You know, Crane, you don't need

41:19.545 --> 41:22.013
some stone tablet to justify
your place in the world.

41:22.014 --> 41:24.682
You belong here just as
much as anyone else.

41:24.683 --> 41:28.987
Even if "here" is a country
that turns its history into

41:28.988 --> 41:30.355
themed restaurants. (snickers)

41:30.356 --> 41:32.156
- Hmm.
- (laughs)

41:32.157 --> 41:34.392
I suppose you're right, Lieutenant.

41:34.393 --> 41:37.795
It's not the country I
thought it would be.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.365
But it is the one I have.

41:40.366 --> 41:43.568
And I must accept it for
what it is, just as I ask it

41:43.569 --> 41:46.004
to accept... me.

41:46.005 --> 41:48.439
And... you were wrong.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.842
When you said that Henry
and Katrina's death

41:50.843 --> 41:52.043
meant that you were alone.

41:52.044 --> 41:54.512
You may not have family, but...

41:54.513 --> 41:56.948
you are not alone.

41:56.949 --> 41:59.317
- I shall drink to that.
- Mm.

41:59.318 --> 42:03.180
Oh, it appears we may need to
provide for ourselves this time.

42:03.181 --> 42:05.189
Oh, take mine. I got it.

42:05.190 --> 42:08.359
For Jenny's sake, I'm
gonna settle our tab.

42:13.399 --> 42:15.400
- Oh!
- Ah! I'm sorry.

42:15.401 --> 42:17.435
- Let me get you another.
- Oh, you know what?

42:17.436 --> 42:19.504
It's okay. I'm gonna take
that as a sign that it's time

42:19.505 --> 42:21.372
to call it a night and
go back home. (laughs)

42:21.373 --> 42:22.740
- Or to the hotel, rather.
- Mm-hmm.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.375
You from out of town?

42:24.376 --> 42:25.877
Yes, I just arrived.

42:25.878 --> 42:27.078
Pandora.

42:27.079 --> 42:28.446
Abbie.

42:28.447 --> 42:29.881
Pandora... that's an interesting name.

42:29.882 --> 42:31.949
It's like the lady with the... the box.

42:31.950 --> 42:34.018
The lady with the box.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.620
Yeah.

42:35.621 --> 42:38.723
Which is actually more of a dowry.

42:40.626 --> 42:42.026
(laughs) You know, I
studied the classics,

42:42.027 --> 42:44.095
so I tend to get a little carried away

42:44.096 --> 42:45.630
with the old stories sometimes.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.098
I have a friend just like that.

42:47.099 --> 42:48.599
♪ It's a hard-knock life
for us... ♪

42:48.600 --> 42:51.436
Oh, I'd like to meet
your friend... sometime.

42:51.437 --> 42:53.938
- ♪ It's a hard knock life for us ♪
- Yeah. Welcome to Sleepy Hollow.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.840
♪ 'Stead of treated, we get tricked ♪

42:55.841 --> 42:58.176
♪ 'Stead of kisses, we get kicked ♪

42:58.177 --> 42:59.877
♪ It's a hard-knock life! ♪

42:59.878 --> 43:02.523
It already feels like home.
