WEBVTT

00:13.880 --> 00:17.248
Sing goddess,
Achilles' rage.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.350
Black and murderous,

00:19.352 --> 00:22.586
that cost the Greeks
incalculable pain.

00:22.588 --> 00:27.594
Pitched, countless souls
of heroes into Hades' dark,

00:28.294 --> 00:29.859
left their bodies to rot

00:29.861 --> 00:33.832
as corpses for dogs and birds.

00:35.234 --> 00:37.233
Did you learn that last night?

00:38.503 --> 00:39.937
There's not a lot
here is there really?

00:39.939 --> 00:41.171
when you think about it?

00:41.173 --> 00:42.473
No, it's
not, no other film.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.507
It is all sandy
beaches, isn't it?

00:44.509 --> 00:49.046
Greeks were camped
here, for 10 years.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.915
- Too long, is it?
- Too long through as a camp.

00:51.917 --> 00:53.851
I can do a week, tops.

00:53.853 --> 00:54.885
In the Lake District.

00:54.887 --> 00:56.419
Yeah, with a pillow.

00:56.421 --> 00:58.256
I won't camp without a pillow.

01:00.359 --> 01:02.460
I had a
bad dream last night.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.727
Was it a portent?

01:04.730 --> 01:08.299
I don't
know, it was bad.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.403
I had a poor tent
once and no groundsheet.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.672
Stick your head out more.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.009
Find your light.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.977
That's it, do an a-ha.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.645
A-ha!

01:21.647 --> 01:23.112
Got it.

01:41.334 --> 01:42.165
Cheers!

01:42.167 --> 01:43.466
Cheers!

01:43.468 --> 01:44.734
Here's to an
enjoyable excursion.

01:44.736 --> 01:45.504
Yeah.

01:47.439 --> 01:48.272
Bellissimo.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.042
Mm-hmm.

01:50.009 --> 01:51.008
It's very odd, isn't it?

01:51.010 --> 01:52.609
To start,

01:52.611 --> 01:54.544
a trip to Greece in Turkey?

01:54.546 --> 01:56.279
It's The Observer's idea

01:56.281 --> 02:00.319
to retrace the steps of
Odysseus, in the "Odyssey".

02:01.253 --> 02:02.520
So, that's what we're doing.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.487
10-year odyssey
in six days, I mean,

02:04.489 --> 02:05.922
it's ambitious Steve.

02:05.924 --> 02:08.024
It might sound ambitious
but if you think of

02:08.026 --> 02:10.259
"Ulysses" by James Joyce.

02:10.262 --> 02:12.463
Thanks for telling me the
author, I'd never have known.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.064
I'm just putting the
information out there

02:14.066 --> 02:14.898
in case you don't.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.299
I don't want, you know.

02:16.301 --> 02:19.568
That's like me saying,
"Harry Potter" by J.K. Rowling.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.841
I wouldn't put "Harry
Potter" and "Ulysses"

02:23.008 --> 02:25.209
in the same camp, apart
from they're both books.

02:25.211 --> 02:28.012
"Harry Potter" has
sold truckloads of books.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.547
Yeah, but the thing is,
I don't measure success

02:29.549 --> 02:31.482
by units sold.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.381
- I measure success...
- You're always telling me

02:32.383 --> 02:34.017
the figures for your TV shows.

02:34.019 --> 02:35.651
Yes, but it's not, it's just...

02:35.653 --> 02:36.585
And the consolidated
ones at that.

02:36.587 --> 02:37.754
- Yes.
- 'cause the actual time

02:37.756 --> 02:39.055
of viewing aren't impressive,

02:39.057 --> 02:41.925
but you do tell me the
consolidated figures.

02:41.927 --> 02:43.960
It's nice to be liked,
but you shouldn't go out

02:43.962 --> 02:46.130
there trying to be liked.

02:52.170 --> 02:55.272
If you think that we
have been doing these,

02:55.274 --> 02:57.941
trips for nearly 10 years,

02:57.943 --> 03:01.043
then, I suppose
in a macro sense,

03:01.045 --> 03:04.013
we've been on this odyssey
for 10 years, yeah?

03:04.015 --> 03:04.815
Is it 10 years?

03:04.817 --> 03:06.883
Yeah, it is.

03:06.885 --> 03:07.887
Since the Lakes.

03:10.522 --> 03:11.424
Richard Gere there.

03:12.424 --> 03:14.090
Just looking off.

03:14.092 --> 03:15.392
Yeah, lovely.

03:15.394 --> 03:18.129
Yeah and you're looking
more like him as well.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.395
That's good.

03:19.397 --> 03:21.065
No, I wasn't being
serious, I was joking.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.965
- Oh.
- You look nothing like him.

03:24.736 --> 03:26.504
My god, you lap that
compliment up, didn't you?

03:26.506 --> 03:27.470
Look at that.

03:27.472 --> 03:28.972
Well, it's not unreasonable.

03:28.974 --> 03:31.542
I'm not, I mean, I'm wearing
my years reasonably well.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.477
Yeah, but in no way do
you resemble Richard Gere.

03:33.479 --> 03:34.710
Okay, I
don't resemble...

03:34.712 --> 03:36.046
You look like a
great Steve Coogan

03:36.048 --> 03:36.981
'cause you're looking...

03:36.983 --> 03:38.249
and I'm happy with that.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.016
- You watched...
- You look like Richard Gere.

03:40.018 --> 03:41.751
I look better as I get older.

03:41.753 --> 03:44.054
- Lots of woman say that.
- Yes, you do.

03:44.056 --> 03:45.288
Well, even man is gonna say.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.256
That's all I'm saying,
you look better older.

03:46.258 --> 03:47.424
Oh, thank you.

03:47.426 --> 03:49.060
You were unpalatable
as a young man.

03:52.631 --> 03:54.096
What's this?

03:54.098 --> 03:56.466
If I'm not mistaken,
it's a Penguin Classic.

03:56.468 --> 03:57.802
And it's by Aristotle.

03:57.804 --> 03:58.668
I know Ari, yeah.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.336
I know all the Stotles.

04:00.338 --> 04:02.506
"Poetics", listen to this,

04:02.508 --> 04:05.174
"epic poetry and the
composition of tragedy

04:05.176 --> 04:06.709
as well as comedy,

04:06.711 --> 04:10.750
and the arts of poetry and
music are all imitations.

04:12.050 --> 04:15.388
Imitation comes naturally
to human beings.

04:16.822 --> 04:20.726
And so does the universal
pleasure in imitation."

04:21.927 --> 04:24.197
Not my words, the
words of Aristotle.

04:29.334 --> 04:32.570
So much of art and
acting is imitation.

04:32.572 --> 04:36.539
But no, you did a
fantastic imitation,

04:36.541 --> 04:37.707
of Stan Laurel

04:37.709 --> 04:40.712
and Stan and Ollie,
it was superb.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.980
I'm not sure it's an
imitation, that's the thing.

04:43.982 --> 04:45.716
I watched it on
a BAFTA screener.

04:45.718 --> 04:48.918
I only paused it three
times to go to the kitchen.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.087
And that in our
house, that's good.

04:51.089 --> 04:52.589
Okay, well, yeah, but...

04:52.591 --> 04:54.591
- You had this.
- Yeah.

04:54.593 --> 04:56.058
Had the pose.

04:56.060 --> 04:57.426
- You know the pose?
- hmm.

04:57.428 --> 04:59.531
- You did that beautifully.
- I certainly did.

05:00.932 --> 05:05.570
Now, why don't you just stop
sitting there and help me.

05:07.005 --> 05:09.708
Well, I'd try but I don't
know what you want me to do.

05:10.776 --> 05:12.879
Stan Laurel and Tom Hardy.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.380
Why don't you just
stand up and help me

05:16.382 --> 05:17.647
instead of sitting there.

05:17.649 --> 05:19.315
I can't hear what
you're saying, Tom.

05:19.317 --> 05:21.418
You're always
mumbling your lines.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.853
Hmm.

05:28.093 --> 05:29.291
Here you go.

05:29.293 --> 05:31.896
Thank you very much,
lovely, really nice.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.063
We're being, bitten.

05:34.065 --> 05:36.231
This doesn't help that
we're under a tree.

05:36.233 --> 05:38.969
Insects love to be under trees.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.003
- Do you know why?
- I went out

05:40.005 --> 05:42.171
- on my land recently.
- Yeah.

05:42.173 --> 05:44.341
- That's to sit under a tree.
- 36 acres, isn't it?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.843
38 and I went to sit
under a tree just to...

05:46.845 --> 05:48.012
To think.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.212
- Well, no, no.
- Just to think.

05:49.214 --> 05:50.480
No, no, to read
the book, actually.

05:50.482 --> 05:52.983
I put a blanket down
just cause this tree.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.519
And I sat under it and
then I start to read.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.253
Then loads of flies started
hovering over my head.

05:57.255 --> 05:58.721
That would happen, yeah.

05:58.723 --> 05:59.957
So, I just got up and
just went back in the house.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.259
I had this idea that...

06:02.261 --> 06:03.627
Steve Coogan, ladies and
gentlemen wonderful stories from

06:03.629 --> 06:06.462
Steve and maybe more from him.

06:06.464 --> 06:07.964
At the same time next week.

06:07.966 --> 06:10.800
You must do that one about
the flies under the tree.

06:10.802 --> 06:13.002
I mean, it's wonderful stuff.

06:13.004 --> 06:15.505
Freddie said he saw you at
Lord's Taverners doing that

06:15.507 --> 06:18.308
and "had the room in
the palm of his hand."

06:18.310 --> 06:19.344
That's what he said.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.711
Wonderful story.

06:21.713 --> 06:22.882
The new Ustinov,

06:25.218 --> 06:26.552
Steve Coogan.

06:27.418 --> 06:28.918
Hear that story Steve's telling.

06:28.920 --> 06:29.752
No, what is it?

06:29.754 --> 06:30.988
Oh, is at the house.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.221
You know the house
in Sussex, yeah?

06:32.223 --> 06:33.757
Well, he took a book out.

06:33.759 --> 06:35.591
No go on.

06:35.593 --> 06:38.094
He wanted to read, but he
went out, took 38 acres.

06:38.096 --> 06:40.096
Yes, he finds a tree,

06:40.098 --> 06:41.498
puts a blanket down.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.997
Oh, it's idyllic.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.401
And flies gather above his head.

06:45.403 --> 06:46.435
He went back in the house.

06:49.641 --> 06:51.843
I mean, he's oh, god.

06:53.345 --> 06:55.378
God, and some people say
he's just Alan Partridge.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.214
He's not.

06:57.048 --> 06:58.584
There's all other sides to him.

07:00.017 --> 07:01.084
Sir, sir, your main courses.

07:01.086 --> 07:02.918
Oh lovely, they're nice.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.753
Thank you.

07:03.755 --> 07:04.721
Lamb chops.

07:04.723 --> 07:05.625
Chops, chop chop.

07:06.625 --> 07:07.524
It mint sauce.

07:07.526 --> 07:08.293
Looks lovely.

07:12.463 --> 07:13.697
Enjoy monsieur.

07:13.699 --> 07:14.630
That's lovely,
thank you very much.

07:14.632 --> 07:15.432
You like lamb, don't you?

07:15.434 --> 07:16.901
I do, I love lamb.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.569
Lamb is very good because
it doesn't lend itself

07:19.571 --> 07:20.771
to intensive farming.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.005
So, if you can't make
an organic choice.

07:22.007 --> 07:23.175
Lambs are safe bet.

07:31.916 --> 07:35.252
My publisher wants me to
use the Odyssey as a peg,

07:35.254 --> 07:38.925
on which to hang my Odyssey
through life of the media.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.259
Isn't that what you wrote
when you were in Spain?

07:42.261 --> 07:43.360
A version of that, yeah.

07:43.362 --> 07:44.861
But it was successful.

07:44.863 --> 07:47.563
So, they want to sort of
a variation on the theme.

07:47.565 --> 07:51.134
I do think you get
older, it's inevitable.

07:51.136 --> 07:52.635
Don't repeat yourself.

07:52.637 --> 07:53.771
This is the fourth time
we've been on one of these

07:53.773 --> 07:54.971
little jaunt.

07:54.973 --> 07:56.839
Originality is overrated,

07:56.841 --> 07:59.009
because everything's
derivative of something.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.144
The greatest poem of the
Roman Empire was a ripoff

08:01.146 --> 08:02.711
of the Odyssey.

08:02.713 --> 08:03.546
Which one?

08:03.548 --> 08:04.813
- The Aeneid.
- Huh.

08:04.815 --> 08:06.750
Whereas the Odyssey is
about Odysseus fleeing

08:06.752 --> 08:08.254
Troy to go home.

08:09.521 --> 08:12.956
The Aeneid is about a
Trojan fleeing the city

08:12.958 --> 08:15.524
with his father and his son.

08:15.526 --> 08:17.060
- Escape...
- What happened to his wife?

08:17.062 --> 08:18.896
Just lost her along the way.

08:18.898 --> 08:19.930
Shit happens.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.430
- But on the plus side,
- yeah.

08:21.432 --> 08:24.670
He went on to found Rome, so
lose a wife found an empire.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.808
This is like a kind
of an interrogation.

08:31.810 --> 08:32.642
Sitting like this.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.147
Your dessert, sir.

08:37.149 --> 08:37.917
Thank you.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.587
it's
black sauce.

08:43.589 --> 08:44.554
Thank you very much.

08:44.556 --> 08:45.756
Could we have the bill please?

08:45.758 --> 08:47.089
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.590
If it wasn't interrogation,
this would be very,

08:48.592 --> 08:50.127
this would be the nice part
before the nasty, wouldn't it?

08:50.129 --> 08:51.393
Let's have some dessert.

08:51.395 --> 08:53.563
We wanna make this as
pleasant as possible.

08:53.565 --> 08:54.765
So...

08:54.767 --> 08:56.669
Oh, great, yeah, what
do you want to know?

08:59.238 --> 09:01.470
Lovely combination
of textures.

09:01.472 --> 09:03.640
This is not...

09:03.642 --> 09:04.677
This is not too light.

09:05.976 --> 09:07.312
- But it's light.
- Hello.

09:08.179 --> 09:09.713
Hi, Steve, hi.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.547
Just calling to check
if everything's okay.

09:11.549 --> 09:12.748
Everything is wonderful.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.083
- I'm here with Rob Brydon.
- Hello.

09:14.085 --> 09:15.718
But apart from that,
everything's wonderful.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.186
Hi, Rob, how are you doing?

09:17.188 --> 09:18.656
All is well.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.757
He's not gone missing,
I'm keeping an eye on him.

09:20.759 --> 09:21.691
What do you mean?

09:21.693 --> 09:23.126
What is she talking about?

09:23.128 --> 09:24.861
Morocco, she was very worried
when you went off the grid.

09:24.863 --> 09:26.296
Yeah.

09:26.298 --> 09:28.631
She even had to call the
authorities, all the newspapers,

09:28.633 --> 09:30.633
"British Comic Goes Missing."

09:30.635 --> 09:32.302
The British actor.

09:32.304 --> 09:34.671
British actor, writer and
producer goes missing.

09:34.673 --> 09:35.939
British actor goes missing.

09:35.941 --> 09:38.642
Friends say, "We had no
idea the mental turmoil

09:38.644 --> 09:40.209
he was under."

09:40.211 --> 09:42.045
We spoke to his close
friend, Rob Brydon.

09:42.047 --> 09:43.215
Well, I must say,

09:44.216 --> 09:45.916
Rob, his associate.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.319
I spoke to his dear
confidant, Rob Brydon,

09:48.321 --> 09:49.419
He's sometime,

09:49.421 --> 09:50.587
- collaborator.
- We spoke to popular

09:50.589 --> 09:52.922
entertainer, Rob Brydon...

09:52.924 --> 09:54.425
light entertainer.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.627
We spoke to popular light
entertainer and confidant

09:57.629 --> 09:59.362
of troubled, star Rob Brydon...

09:59.364 --> 10:01.097
Troubled TV funny man.

10:01.099 --> 10:04.334
Says, I have no idea
Steve was suffering

10:04.336 --> 10:05.802
the way he was.

10:05.804 --> 10:07.270
We didn't know he was
suffering but then we realised

10:07.272 --> 10:10.340
he'd spent six days with Rob
Brydon and things start to fall

10:10.342 --> 10:11.507
into place then.

10:11.509 --> 10:14.009
We think, this might
be a cry for help.

10:14.011 --> 10:15.712
Sorry, I've got to go.

10:15.714 --> 10:17.013
I just wanted to
let you know that

10:17.015 --> 10:20.083
your boat is gonna be
leaving Assos at 2:30

10:20.085 --> 10:22.819
so if you're going to Assos
is where the boat is, okay?

10:22.821 --> 10:24.720
And your Ranger Rover

10:24.722 --> 10:27.022
We get our asses
in the boat, when?

10:27.024 --> 10:28.758
Wonderful, looking
forward to it.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.227
Bye, all right, see you.

10:30.229 --> 10:31.861
Did you understand
any of that?

10:31.863 --> 10:34.433
Yeah, Range Rover
waiting for us at Lesbos.

10:45.510 --> 10:49.946
This is what
UNESCO says about Assos;

10:49.948 --> 10:53.882
"In antiquity, it's
hilltop location made Assos

10:53.884 --> 10:56.552
an easily defensible port city.

10:56.554 --> 10:59.421
The oldest direct
temple of Asia Minor;

10:59.423 --> 11:02.425
the Temple of Athena at Assos,

11:02.427 --> 11:04.964
is located on the top
of the acropolis."

11:07.932 --> 11:12.804
That's Lesbos, the border
between Asia and Europe.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.473
It's close, isn't it?

11:16.475 --> 11:17.306
Yeah.

11:17.308 --> 11:18.508
I can swim there.

11:18.510 --> 11:20.209
You could not.

11:20.211 --> 11:23.378
Something like Byron
swimming the Hellespont

11:23.380 --> 11:25.717
from Asia to Europe in Istanbul.

11:26.818 --> 11:27.917
That's why all the
refugees come this way,

11:27.919 --> 11:29.185
because it's so easy.

11:29.187 --> 11:31.188
They don't swim it,
they do it in boats.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.623
Yeah very little boats.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.425
Byron said, of all the
things that he's achieved

11:35.427 --> 11:36.693
swimming the Hellespont
was the thing

11:36.695 --> 11:38.129
that made him the most proud.

11:39.298 --> 11:40.763
Fair enough.

11:40.765 --> 11:42.398
What would you say,

11:42.400 --> 11:44.269
was the thing you're
most proud of?

11:45.903 --> 11:47.405
My seven BAFTAs.

11:48.606 --> 11:49.873
For me,
it'd be my children.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.475
Yeah, 'cause I
haven't got any BAFTAs.

11:52.477 --> 11:54.276
But, you
have got children?

11:54.278 --> 11:55.548
Which is, interesting.

12:01.885 --> 12:03.719
Williams, as some of
the men are not happy,

12:03.721 --> 12:05.254
there are rumblings.

12:05.256 --> 12:06.757
Oh there are
rumblings, are there?

12:06.759 --> 12:08.057
You tell the men that
we were sailing around

12:08.059 --> 12:09.224
the Cape of Good Hope.

12:09.226 --> 12:10.794
and we'll sail round the horn.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.628
I think if the
weather was this nice,

12:12.630 --> 12:14.430
they would have been
a lot more relaxed.

12:14.432 --> 12:16.233
They're loving it, Bill.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.467
They really are.

12:17.469 --> 12:19.334
Well, thank you
very much, Fletcher.

12:19.336 --> 12:21.305
You don't mind if I call
you Fletcher, do you?

12:21.307 --> 12:22.772
Call me
Fletcher if you like.

12:22.774 --> 12:23.672
Thank you very
much, I'll call you Fletch.

12:23.674 --> 12:24.840
Can I call you Bill?

12:24.842 --> 12:26.776
Yeah of
course you can

12:26.778 --> 12:27.710
Not Fletch?

12:51.102 --> 12:52.502
He said a-ha.

12:52.504 --> 12:53.672
What's that?

12:55.106 --> 12:55.875
A-ha!

12:59.311 --> 13:03.879
A-ha!

13:05.984 --> 13:06.882
You've had a huge drive then.

13:06.884 --> 13:08.751
Yeah, it's a monster really.

13:08.753 --> 13:09.752
So, you're flying back now.

13:09.754 --> 13:10.587
- Yeah.
- Is this Steve?

13:10.589 --> 13:11.754
Here are the keys.

13:11.756 --> 13:13.089
Oh my God.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.023
Thank you.

13:14.025 --> 13:14.858
Yeah, enjoy.

13:14.860 --> 13:15.757
Full tank?

13:15.759 --> 13:16.626
Tank is full and it's hybrid.

13:16.628 --> 13:17.926
So, you've got the...

13:17.928 --> 13:18.762
Steve?

13:18.764 --> 13:19.595
That's enough.

13:19.597 --> 13:20.430
That's all, thanks.

13:20.432 --> 13:21.329
All right, good.

13:21.331 --> 13:22.802
Safe flight, cheers, bye-bye.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.334
Steve, how are you?

13:25.336 --> 13:26.172
This is Kareem.

13:27.105 --> 13:28.003
Do you remember me?

13:28.005 --> 13:29.475
We worked together in Mykonos.

13:30.674 --> 13:33.509
I played the refugees
in the beach.

13:33.511 --> 13:34.345
Okay.

13:35.647 --> 13:36.546
Do you remember me?

13:36.548 --> 13:37.847
- Refugee?
- Yes.

13:37.849 --> 13:39.416
- How are you.
- I am Kareem, how are you?

13:39.418 --> 13:40.650
Hi, very good.

13:40.652 --> 13:42.919
It's really good to see you.

13:42.921 --> 13:43.986
Hi, Rob.

13:43.988 --> 13:44.921
- Rob?
- That's Rob, yeah.

13:44.923 --> 13:45.754
Nice to meet you, I'm Kareem.

13:45.756 --> 13:48.090
What are you doing here?

13:48.092 --> 13:49.559
Well, it's not a holiday.

13:49.561 --> 13:52.262
We're actually working with
the retracing the steps

13:52.264 --> 13:55.464
of Odysseus, going
from Troy to Ithaca.

13:55.466 --> 13:56.632
What about you?

13:56.634 --> 13:57.901
Are you still with refugees?

13:57.903 --> 13:59.636
I'm working with
the refugees, still.

13:59.638 --> 14:00.837
The refugees, still here?

14:00.839 --> 14:02.472
Yes, thousands of refugees.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.007
- Thousands?
- Yes, you know,

14:04.009 --> 14:06.108
maybe I need the lift.

14:06.110 --> 14:09.512
Maybe it could be so good
for you to come and see.

14:09.514 --> 14:11.381
It's very good for your Odyssey.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.581
I'm sitting now.

14:12.583 --> 14:13.882
Yes.

14:13.884 --> 14:14.818
I would love to
but we've got a..

14:14.820 --> 14:15.584
Where are we gonna go next?

14:15.586 --> 14:16.252
We've got a...

14:16.254 --> 14:17.085
You know what?

14:17.087 --> 14:18.320
We're not so busy.

14:18.322 --> 14:21.022
We can spare enough
time to drop him off.

14:21.024 --> 14:22.257
That's what this is all about.

14:22.259 --> 14:23.459
We'll talk in the car.

14:23.461 --> 14:25.728
It'd be good for Rob
to see a refugee camp.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.097
So you're going to
see the refugee camp.

14:28.099 --> 14:29.398
It'd be good for me
to see the refugee camp.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.600
- Thank you guys for the lift.
- Thanks Steve.

14:30.602 --> 14:31.436
No worries.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.504
It's really
nice car, Steve.

14:35.506 --> 14:36.674
Thanks, it's not mine.

14:38.509 --> 14:40.877
- It was loaned to me for this
- Us

14:40.879 --> 14:41.945
thing we're doing to...

14:41.947 --> 14:43.213
Was a us.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.047
I mean, it's a hybrid,
so, it's half electric.

14:45.049 --> 14:47.550
So, it kind of cushions
the impacts that a

14:47.552 --> 14:49.651
monster gas guzzler
like this normally...

14:49.653 --> 14:50.719
That's important
to you, isn't it?

14:50.721 --> 14:51.887
That's important.

14:51.889 --> 14:52.689
- We'll it is, yeah.
- Probably the

14:52.691 --> 14:53.857
environmental thing.

14:53.859 --> 14:55.391
- But...
- Steve has nine cars, Kareem.

14:55.393 --> 14:56.626
Nine car?

14:56.628 --> 14:58.295
- Yeah, nine cars.
- Oh, so good man.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.196
- That's irrelevant.
- How many of them

15:00.198 --> 15:01.730
are electric?

15:01.732 --> 15:02.931
I have an electric car.

15:02.933 --> 15:04.600
- Yeah.
- We're writing an article.

15:04.602 --> 15:06.002
I'm writing an article.

15:06.004 --> 15:07.237
I'm writing an article,

15:07.239 --> 15:08.438
Well, Rob is and...

15:08.440 --> 15:09.605
Steve doesn't have
time to actually

15:09.607 --> 15:11.206
- write it.
- I do.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.775
I've go a lot of
weighty thoughts.

15:12.777 --> 15:13.944
Well, I do write.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.210
But he services
cars, I mean that takes

15:15.212 --> 15:16.145
- a lot of his time.
- I do.

15:16.147 --> 15:18.384
Anyhow, so what's been going on?

15:19.884 --> 15:21.818
What are you up
to at the moment?

15:21.820 --> 15:24.753
I'm here now set
up a cultural event.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.922
It's a musical and dance.

15:26.924 --> 15:28.090
Really?

15:28.092 --> 15:30.526
We do some music
courses, music therapy.

15:30.528 --> 15:32.127
I dance and I do some teaching.

15:32.129 --> 15:33.796
- Great.
- Fantastic.

15:33.798 --> 15:35.765
Some community
building inclusion.

15:35.767 --> 15:36.766
Great.

15:36.768 --> 15:37.599
Here we are.

15:37.601 --> 15:38.971
This is a small city.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.103
Gosh.

15:42.105 --> 15:43.506
So, what's this barbed wire for?

15:43.508 --> 15:45.675
It looks like a prison camp.

15:45.677 --> 15:48.945
Is that to stop people getting
in or stop them getting out?

15:48.947 --> 15:51.350
Policy of this
camp is really breezy.

15:52.750 --> 15:55.754
It's a lot more established
than I would have expected.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.456
Really,
nice to meet you.

16:01.458 --> 16:02.592
Good luck
with everything.

16:02.594 --> 16:03.696
Hope it all works out.

16:07.131 --> 16:09.898
Oh, Steve, thank
you very much.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.099
Okay, thank you.

16:11.101 --> 16:12.134
I'm coming to Britain.

16:12.136 --> 16:13.502
I hope I'll see you there.

16:13.504 --> 16:14.671
Have
you got my emails?

16:14.673 --> 16:16.373
Yes, I will contact
you, thank you.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.940
Do the turning here.

16:17.942 --> 16:18.844
I will go inside.

16:36.094 --> 16:37.627
Well, that was sobering.

16:37.629 --> 16:41.263
Imagine living in that for
years and years and years.

16:41.265 --> 16:44.834
Well, it's just like the
Greek's camps outside Troy.

16:44.836 --> 16:46.435
Best part of 10 years.

16:46.437 --> 16:47.671
Too long.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.604
I've said it before,
I'll say it again.

16:48.606 --> 16:50.509
That's too long for camping.

16:52.043 --> 16:52.877
Nice guy.

16:54.044 --> 16:56.713
Yes, well,
he's a very nice bloke.

16:56.715 --> 16:57.980
I mean, I know him.

16:57.982 --> 16:59.984
We worked together
last year on a film.

17:01.052 --> 17:02.251
He said.

17:02.253 --> 17:04.886
He played a sort of
version of himself.

17:04.887 --> 17:07.055
You didn't remember
him, did you?

17:07.057 --> 17:07.957
What?

17:07.959 --> 17:10.026
Of course I remembered him.

17:10.028 --> 17:13.395
I worked with him for
a month, at least.

17:13.396 --> 17:15.131
So, of course I remembered him.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.433
Maybe not at first but
eventually, yeah, like yeah.

17:17.435 --> 17:18.403
Hey, how you doing?

17:21.137 --> 17:22.006
What's his name?

17:24.977 --> 17:25.810
What's his name?

17:26.844 --> 17:28.044
What are you testing?

17:28.046 --> 17:28.978
Why you asking,
"what's his name?

17:28.980 --> 17:30.513
What's his name?"

17:30.515 --> 17:31.248
I'm not testing you,
I'm just interested to see,

17:31.250 --> 17:32.084
what's his name?

17:36.921 --> 17:37.756
Khalid

17:40.224 --> 17:41.423
It's Kareem.

17:41.425 --> 17:43.125
Okay, so I got the
first syllable, right?

17:43.127 --> 17:44.096
Oh, well done.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.599
You know where
the word lesbian comes from?

17:50.601 --> 17:53.603
Yes, it was from the
island, from Lesbos.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.706
Sappho was the priestess
who wrote erotic poetry

17:56.708 --> 18:01.344
to all these women she
loved and was obsessed with.

18:01.346 --> 18:04.980
And she was the most
celebrated poet.

18:04.982 --> 18:07.382
It's not, lesbian but the
most celebrated person

18:07.384 --> 18:09.051
in ancient Greece.

18:09.053 --> 18:12.354
And she was a woman
and she was a lesbian.

18:12.356 --> 18:14.256
It's a shame we
get in the ferry.

18:14.258 --> 18:17.427
I would like to stay
in the Hotel Lesbian,

18:17.429 --> 18:18.795
as I'm sure you would.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.529
I think.

18:20.531 --> 18:23.231
Come on Mr. Bond, do you like
staying in the Hotel Lesbian,

18:23.233 --> 18:25.067
just as much as I do?

18:26.337 --> 18:27.504
If I can get my head
down and the lesbian.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.341
I'm more than happy.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.342
Welcome to the Hotel Lesbian.

18:32.344 --> 18:35.510
You can check out anytime
you like, but you can

18:35.512 --> 18:38.349
- never leave.
- Never leave.

18:53.765 --> 18:56.600
♪ Sailing.

18:56.602 --> 19:00.303
♪ I am sailing

19:00.305 --> 19:04.006
♪ Home again

19:04.008 --> 19:06.442
♪ Across the sea

19:07.880 --> 19:11.346
♪ I am sailing

19:11.348 --> 19:15.151
♪ stormy waters

19:15.153 --> 19:18.889
♪ to be near you,

19:18.891 --> 19:22.961
♪ to be free.

19:23.961 --> 19:25.460
How do you know Australia?

19:25.462 --> 19:29.298
There was a 25 year old girl
on the crew, who'd never heard

19:29.300 --> 19:30.498
of Rod Stewart.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.171
Never heard those two
words in that order.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.471
So, when I used to got out
with the girl I used to say,

19:35.473 --> 19:36.338
remember this?

19:36.340 --> 19:37.840
Remember that?

19:37.842 --> 19:39.811
And I just go, "When I was
young we used to do this."

19:47.384 --> 19:50.753
Stagira is the
birthplace of Aristotle.

19:50.755 --> 19:54.023
Stagira was besieged
and destroyed in 348 BC

19:54.025 --> 19:55.557
by Philip of Macedonia.

19:55.559 --> 19:59.260
The inhabitants were enslaved,
later Philip rebuilt the city

19:59.262 --> 20:01.430
has a reward for
Aristotle being tutored

20:01.432 --> 20:02.467
to his son Alexander.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.004
How much further is it?

20:08.472 --> 20:11.175
It's just around, it's
just the top of this road.

20:12.509 --> 20:14.613
A stone in my sandal again.

20:17.715 --> 20:19.649
Come on.

20:19.651 --> 20:22.852
What do you mean come on?

20:22.854 --> 20:24.086
Well, this is it.

20:24.088 --> 20:25.990
This is the shrine
to Aristotle...

20:27.192 --> 20:30.258
Well, they imported
his ashes back here

20:30.260 --> 20:34.465
especially to leave them here
as, this is his hometown.

20:35.666 --> 20:37.266
It's not a lot
to look at, is it?

20:37.268 --> 20:39.603
I can see why they don't charge.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.136
Maybe uproar.

20:41.138 --> 20:43.975
Lego land cost a fortune but
you get a lot for your money.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.044
Do you think there'll
be a memorial to you?

20:48.046 --> 20:49.612
I don't
believe in monuments.

20:49.614 --> 20:52.215
Just something
modest in Manchester.

20:52.217 --> 20:53.018
Yeah.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.126
I didn't picture
Macedonia like this.

21:04.128 --> 21:05.961
I imagined it to
be quite rugged.

21:05.963 --> 21:10.969
I didn't think it would
be verdant and soft.

21:11.803 --> 21:12.671
I know.

21:14.105 --> 21:15.171
- Excuse me.
- Our starter, sir.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.173
Thank you.

21:17.275 --> 21:18.507
- Oh.
- As a starter,

21:18.509 --> 21:20.176
we have the mussels on
smoked pine needles,

21:20.178 --> 21:22.478
with Parmesan cheese, green
asparagus, a little bit

21:22.480 --> 21:25.213
of citrus and espresso
powder, enjoy.

21:25.215 --> 21:26.180
Thank you, Mr. Tim.

21:26.182 --> 21:27.016
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

21:27.018 --> 21:27.850
Thank you.

21:27.852 --> 21:29.084
Espresso powder dust.

21:29.086 --> 21:30.987
That's an ingredient
I wasn't expecting

21:30.989 --> 21:34.958
but it's also
piqued my curiosity.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.794
It's a little,

21:37.095 --> 21:37.929
hmm,

21:39.397 --> 21:41.296
well, that's,

21:41.298 --> 21:42.230
That's complex.

21:42.232 --> 21:43.934
That is absolutely divine.

21:50.642 --> 21:54.009
People talk about Alexander the
Great while overlook all the

21:54.011 --> 21:56.179
psychotic tendencies he had.

21:56.181 --> 21:59.248
With his mother he conspires
to kill his father.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.816
And then after that
went on a killing spree,

22:01.818 --> 22:05.154
rounding up all his half
siblings and cousins

22:05.156 --> 22:06.788
who might have a legitimate
claim to the throne

22:06.790 --> 22:09.758
and just ruthlessly and
horribly murdered them.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.461
He was a gangster, an
old-fashioned gangster.

22:12.463 --> 22:14.463
We call him
Alexander the Great.

22:14.465 --> 22:16.834
On common ground
is just a gangster.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.001
I'm gonna commit
atrocious crimes.

22:20.003 --> 22:21.804
I'm doing Marlon Brando.

22:21.806 --> 22:23.338
Good, I'm glad
you flagged that up.

22:23.340 --> 22:27.442
Commit atrocious crimes,
I'm gonna behave despicably.

22:27.444 --> 22:28.643
You need to make a mark,

22:28.645 --> 22:30.715
get out of my way, when
you speak like that.

22:32.048 --> 22:35.651
You talk like that
doesn't

22:35.653 --> 22:37.255
What are you
doing, let me hear?

22:38.423 --> 22:41.224
He speaks like he
has, his cheeks were

22:41.226 --> 22:42.857
full of cotton balls

22:42.859 --> 22:44.427
Well, but they were
full of cotton balls

22:44.429 --> 22:45.862
I know.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.129
But they weren't full of
those things that dentists use

22:47.131 --> 22:49.434
- to syphon the...
- Dental swab.

22:50.601 --> 22:51.968
They don't use them
anymore for some reason.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.736
- They don't need them.
- I don't know why.

22:53.738 --> 22:55.837
Because dentistry
has advanced.

22:55.839 --> 22:57.340
Dentistry has advanced.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.507
We've made a lot of
great strides in dentistry.

22:59.509 --> 23:00.977
I know what that is.

23:00.979 --> 23:02.210
You know, dentistry has
advanced quite a lot actually.

23:02.212 --> 23:03.612
That's, you know what?

23:03.614 --> 23:07.016
I like to hire you
Aristotle to educate my son.

23:07.018 --> 23:09.387
I like you to teach him
a lot about philosophy.

23:10.587 --> 23:12.520
I'm very flattered by
the offer but I must say

23:12.522 --> 23:15.057
I'm finding it very hard
to forget what you did

23:15.059 --> 23:17.026
just a year ago, which
was a smashing sport.

23:17.028 --> 23:18.193
Well, you know what?

23:18.195 --> 23:19.728
I'll tell you what I'll do.

23:19.730 --> 23:21.229
If you don't teach my son, I
rip the head off, shit down

23:21.231 --> 23:22.965
your goddamn fucking neck,
you stupid dick sucking

23:22.967 --> 23:25.401
motherfucking asshole, okay?

23:25.403 --> 23:27.569
But it's essentially
being a gangster.

23:27.571 --> 23:30.373
I bet if you stayed in
London, could be Ray Winston.

23:30.375 --> 23:34.376
If you're going to be teaching
my boy, Aristotle, right?

23:34.378 --> 23:37.779
I don't want some airy-fairy
nonce coming here, what...

23:37.781 --> 23:38.713
Thank you, lovely.

23:38.715 --> 23:39.748
- Hello.
- Very nice.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.817
Wonderful,
compliments to the chef.

23:41.819 --> 23:43.387
I will certainly.

23:44.255 --> 23:45.090
Mr. Seven.

23:46.257 --> 23:47.923
Is that your Christian name?

23:47.925 --> 23:49.124
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah, good.

23:49.126 --> 23:50.892
Mr. Steve, Mr. Rob.

23:50.894 --> 23:52.760
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello

23:52.762 --> 23:54.462
He won't know
who Basil Brush is.

23:54.464 --> 23:55.597
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:55.599 --> 23:57.298
Now you listen to me.

23:57.300 --> 24:00.469
I wanna make sure it's not
just airy-fairy thinking.

24:00.471 --> 24:03.338
It's not a great Ray Winston,
I lost a part to him you know.

24:03.340 --> 24:04.340
What's that?

24:04.342 --> 24:06.007
- Seriously we-
- Why would you?

24:06.009 --> 24:07.610
I went, that's what I thought.

24:12.482 --> 24:14.917
I saw Henry VIII,
which I thought was,

24:14.919 --> 24:17.754
I mean, he's a great actor,
but I thought that was odd.

24:17.756 --> 24:18.987
he gave him the Cockney
accent, didn't he?

24:18.989 --> 24:19.788
Yeah, it was Henry the Eighth

24:19.790 --> 24:21.056
with a Cockney accent.

24:21.058 --> 24:23.359
He's like 'I really
fancy that Anne Boleyn,

24:23.361 --> 24:26.194
but I got this old trout on
me back... Catherine of Aragon

24:26.196 --> 24:27.630
don't know what to do about it.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.797
Sire.

24:28.799 --> 24:29.632
Thinking to get in
her, I want to bag her,

24:29.634 --> 24:31.065
I want to bed her.

24:31.067 --> 24:32.834
- Sire, might I interrupt?
- I'm gonna do her.

24:32.836 --> 24:34.803
Your new palace, Hampton
Court, is ready sir.

24:34.805 --> 24:36.471
We've had the jacuzzi put in.

24:36.473 --> 24:37.873
Would you like to inspect it?

24:37.875 --> 24:40.008
Fucking Pope said I can't
get a fucking divorce.

24:40.010 --> 24:42.044
I'm saying what about if
I say, well I'm in charge,

24:42.046 --> 24:43.879
I'm the head of the
church, how about that?

24:43.881 --> 24:45.381
What do you think about that?

24:45.383 --> 24:47.415
How about I went round all
your monasteries and fucking

24:47.417 --> 24:48.549
knock this shit out of them?

24:48.551 --> 24:50.585
I mean every single fucking one.

24:50.587 --> 24:51.519
So, I'll fucking
level all of them.

24:51.521 --> 24:53.788
How about that Mr. Fucking Pope?

24:53.790 --> 24:57.793
Your Royal Highness, Anne
Boleyn is waiting for you in the

24:57.795 --> 24:59.128
anti chamber Your
Royal Highness.

24:59.130 --> 25:00.395
Should I bring her through?

25:00.397 --> 25:03.132
Yeah, tell her
I've a real boner.

25:03.134 --> 25:04.667
I'm pleased to hear
that Your Royal Highness.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.102
Might I say your one's
Royal boner is looking

25:07.104 --> 25:08.004
particularly majestic
this morning.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.505
Yeah, I really like her.

25:09.507 --> 25:12.173
Say, semi-chamber or
whatever you call it.

25:12.175 --> 25:15.044
Is sire you're
speaking euphemistically?

25:15.046 --> 25:16.711
Why are you
talking like a nonce?

25:16.713 --> 25:17.646
Because I'm
terrified of you sir.

25:17.648 --> 25:19.047
I'm not a nonce.

25:19.049 --> 25:20.216
I'm not an nonce, sir.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.717
I'm not a nonce.

25:21.719 --> 25:23.052
This is a rumour that has
been put around the court

25:23.054 --> 25:25.188
- by Cromwell.
- All right, whatever.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.855
Well you know Anne Boleyn.

25:27.857 --> 25:29.025
She's not, she likes you sir.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.691
She messes me around.

25:30.693 --> 25:32.294
I'll chop her fucking head off.

25:32.296 --> 25:34.462
Literally chop her
fucking head off.

25:34.464 --> 25:37.834
She dicks me about, I'll get
a swordsman over from France.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.101
Oh Sire.

25:39.103 --> 25:40.334
She can kneel down
across her.

25:40.336 --> 25:43.971
That speaks so clearly
of Sire's class, sir.

25:43.973 --> 25:46.877
To chop off my lady's
head with the swordsman.

25:53.183 --> 25:54.019
Hello.

25:55.986 --> 25:58.688
I don't like seeing
my chin in this, dome.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.556
- Thank you.
- Dessert, gentlemen.

26:01.558 --> 26:04.927
We have the almond crumble
with yuzu cream fresh citrus

26:04.929 --> 26:07.430
and blood orange on
top of that, enjoy.

26:07.432 --> 26:08.297
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

26:08.299 --> 26:09.599
My pleasure.

26:12.103 --> 26:14.236
Who would you be if
you could be a Greek god?

26:14.238 --> 26:16.104
Which God would you be?

26:16.106 --> 26:17.338
I have been cast
as a Greek god.

26:17.340 --> 26:18.606
When?

26:18.608 --> 26:20.174
I played Hades
in Percy Jackson.

26:20.176 --> 26:21.642
Yes, Percy Jackson,
the Lightning Thief.

26:21.644 --> 26:24.646
Yeah, they made
more of those films.

26:24.648 --> 26:25.547
Hmm hmm.

26:25.549 --> 26:26.882
What happened to Hades?

26:26.884 --> 26:28.517
They just didn't
invite me back.

26:29.354 --> 26:30.188
Oh.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.058
Hello, Joe, Joe?

26:35.025 --> 26:35.959
Hey Dad, how are you?

26:35.961 --> 26:37.226
Good, good.

26:37.228 --> 26:38.393
What's going on?

26:38.395 --> 26:40.863
Yeah, Grandad's
in hospital again.

26:40.865 --> 26:42.297
What?

26:42.299 --> 26:46.101
Yeah, I've been
to see him, seems okay.

26:46.103 --> 26:48.503
Okay, so, it's the
same thing as before.

26:48.505 --> 26:50.471
Yeah, same thing as before.

26:50.473 --> 26:52.440
It's all routine.

26:52.442 --> 26:53.843
They're doing some tests.

26:53.845 --> 26:55.477
- Your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you very much.

26:55.479 --> 26:56.446
Did you like the dessert?

26:56.448 --> 26:57.680
Yeah, it's lovely.

26:57.682 --> 26:58.381
I can't eat citrus,
I had to leave it.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.217
Thank you.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.552
I'm glad you're there.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.519
- And my mum's actually,
- Okay.

27:04.521 --> 27:06.020
Phillips moved out.

27:06.022 --> 27:08.457
He's left her, so I'm...

27:08.459 --> 27:09.294
Philip?

27:10.528 --> 27:13.796
Yeah, Philip her
partner, her boyfriend.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.096
Oh yeah.

27:15.098 --> 27:15.998
He's been living
with her for two years.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.665
Yeah, I think I met him.

27:17.667 --> 27:20.235
Very good evening to you and
welcome to this very special

27:20.237 --> 27:22.438
Greek edition of Guess The bill

27:22.440 --> 27:24.140
coming to you from the
beautiful Greek island of

27:24.142 --> 27:27.343
beach here in the northernmost
part of Southern Greece.

27:27.345 --> 27:30.478
And joining us to play tonight
is a returning champion

27:30.480 --> 27:33.082
from pedantry in the north
of England is Stephen Coogan.

27:33.084 --> 27:34.816
Steve, good evening?

27:34.818 --> 27:35.653
"Hello."

27:37.087 --> 27:38.720
If you need me to come
back and just let me know,

27:38.722 --> 27:39.555
I'll jump on a plane.

27:39.557 --> 27:41.055
All right?

27:41.057 --> 27:42.423
Okay, I love you.

27:42.425 --> 27:45.094
I love you too dad, bye-bye.

27:45.096 --> 27:46.362
And the wonderful thing about
you Steve, is you never pick

27:46.364 --> 27:48.764
another person up on
what they're doing.

27:48.766 --> 27:51.633
"No, it would
literally never occur."

27:51.635 --> 27:54.504
Oh, here he is, the
man himself, Steven,

27:54.506 --> 27:56.671
on this beautiful
beach side setting.

27:56.673 --> 27:58.977
Would you like to
play Guess The Bill?

28:00.345 --> 28:01.211
Not really no.

28:02.179 --> 28:04.182
All right, it's 307 euro.

28:20.798 --> 28:22.965
Hey Chloe, it's daddy.

28:22.967 --> 28:24.232
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:24.234 --> 28:25.069
How are you?

28:26.336 --> 28:28.004
- Good.
- Good, what you're up to?

28:28.006 --> 28:30.940
Just watching some
stuff on my iPad.

28:30.942 --> 28:32.009
And Where's Charlie?

28:33.176 --> 28:36.545
Charlie isn't here,
he's sleeping right now.

28:36.547 --> 28:38.747
All right then let me speak
straight to mommy then darling

28:38.749 --> 28:41.217
and I'll talk to
you again tomorrow.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.151
She's not here.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.920
She's not there as well.

28:43.922 --> 28:45.321
Where is she?

28:45.323 --> 28:47.523
The theatre.

28:47.525 --> 28:48.757
You said the theatre,

28:48.759 --> 28:50.426
what's she going to
see at the theatre?

28:50.428 --> 28:51.760
I don't know.

28:51.762 --> 28:53.130
And who did she go with?

28:54.298 --> 28:55.998
Don't
know that either.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.403
But you know she's
gone to the theatre.

29:00.137 --> 29:01.804
Yeah.

29:01.806 --> 29:02.807
All right.

29:07.612 --> 29:08.709
Gotta move on.

29:11.715 --> 29:12.881
Run Dad, keep up.

29:14.184 --> 29:15.352
Keep moving.

29:17.555 --> 29:18.590
Are you okay?

29:24.362 --> 29:25.529
You all right?

29:31.568 --> 29:32.668
Catherine.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.770
Oh husband that I love.

29:34.772 --> 29:38.172
Why do you choose to give
in to such wild grief?

29:38.174 --> 29:39.708
Catherine!

29:39.710 --> 29:40.545
Fare well.

29:41.878 --> 29:45.849

When I'm in Greece,
I hear the word grease,

30:49.681 --> 30:51.212
I think Greece,

30:51.214 --> 30:52.847
Yes, but it's not the same
thing as it's a homophone.

30:52.849 --> 30:54.182
- No, no, no, no.
- It's a homophone.

30:54.184 --> 30:56.084
It's a how dare you?

30:56.086 --> 30:58.019
How dare you?

30:58.021 --> 30:59.488
I'm not a homophone.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.459
- Good evening.
- I'm not a homophone.

31:05.461 --> 31:07.796
I'm not looking for me Steve.

31:07.798 --> 31:09.465
Grease is the word, yes?

31:09.467 --> 31:11.499
It's the word that you
heard, it's got a groove,

31:11.501 --> 31:13.001
it's got a meaning.

31:13.003 --> 31:14.236
Greece is the time, is
the place, is the motion.

31:14.238 --> 31:16.171
Well, grease is the
way we're feeling.

31:16.173 --> 31:18.173
Talk more about
that, expand on that.

31:18.175 --> 31:22.277
Do you know who wrote Grease?

31:22.279 --> 31:24.046
Steve Coogan, did you
know who wrote Grease?

31:24.048 --> 31:24.947
No, I don't think...

31:24.949 --> 31:26.382
It was Barry Gibb.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.583
I know all the other
writers from ancient Greece,

31:27.585 --> 31:29.017
but no, that's not
as important to you.

31:29.019 --> 31:30.719
- Is who wrote the song Grease.
- Well, it was written

31:30.721 --> 31:34.288
by Barry Gibb because Robert
Stigwood the Bee Gees manager

31:34.290 --> 31:35.958
was producing the music
without the original

31:35.960 --> 31:38.526
stage musical because he
didn't have the song Grease.

31:38.528 --> 31:41.395
Robin said to Barry we're
enjoying such great success

31:41.397 --> 31:45.469
with such tragedy.

31:47.770 --> 31:49.004
Do you know who wrote that,

31:49.006 --> 31:50.372
"a friend to everyone
is a friend to no one?"

31:50.374 --> 31:51.974
Yes, Aristotle,

31:51.976 --> 31:53.508
- now let me tell you this.
- It's because I told you.

31:53.510 --> 31:55.544
No, I knew it already.

31:55.546 --> 31:58.115
You don't know anything.

32:00.884 --> 32:03.418
You know more about
these irrelevant things

32:03.420 --> 32:05.254
like who wrote the song Grease.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.757
These trivialities than anything
to do with ancient Greece

32:08.759 --> 32:10.292
other than what I've
spoon fed to you

32:10.294 --> 32:11.763
over the last few days.

32:13.263 --> 32:17.164
♪ Grease is the time, is
the place, is the motion ♪

32:17.166 --> 32:21.469
♪ And Grease is the
way we are feeling. ♪

32:25.843 --> 32:28.376
You know, the Greeks
thought Delphi was the centre

32:28.378 --> 32:31.212
of the world, literally the
centre of the Greek world,

32:31.214 --> 32:33.481
the navel, as it were.

32:33.483 --> 32:35.482
Yes, I think so.

32:35.484 --> 32:36.820
And they had a cave

32:39.088 --> 32:42.023
and the woman in the
cave sitting on a tripod,

32:42.025 --> 32:45.392
with smoke coming
up underneath her,

32:45.394 --> 32:47.128
they'd have a prophet
there to interpret.

32:47.130 --> 32:48.529
She would then shoot,
the smoke would come up

32:48.531 --> 32:49.900
and she'd start going.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.001
And they'd have a prophet to
interpret what she was saying.

32:54.003 --> 32:57.873
And the people believed
that it was Apollo,

32:57.875 --> 33:01.642
sending his words up in
smoke through her vagina

33:01.644 --> 33:02.680
and out of her mouth.

33:04.214 --> 33:06.550
And she was the
Priestess Pythia.

33:08.384 --> 33:09.750
Well, are going to
make a joke about it?

33:09.752 --> 33:11.253
No.

33:11.255 --> 33:14.258
If I did, it wouldn't be
one of my Pythia comments.

33:15.392 --> 33:16.857
There's something
lucky in this.

33:16.859 --> 33:18.427
Probably where the phrase

33:18.429 --> 33:21.430
"blowing smoke up
your ass" comes from.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.668
It was a vagina, not ass.

33:24.801 --> 33:27.268
I hope you know the
difference by now, Rob.

33:27.270 --> 33:29.638
Got help your wife, 'cause
she didn't know which

33:29.640 --> 33:30.541
way to turn.

33:32.009 --> 33:34.875
Now, this here is the stone
that Zeus dropped to signify

33:34.877 --> 33:38.646
the centre of the world, the
navel of the world just there.

33:38.648 --> 33:40.484
It's more like
a clitoris though.

33:41.884 --> 33:43.084
It does though, it looks
more like a giant clitoris.

33:43.086 --> 33:46.153
Well, that's almost
certainly deliberate.

33:46.155 --> 33:47.956
This is a shrine to the female.

33:47.958 --> 33:51.626
So it's a Gaia, Mother
Earth, the creative.

33:51.628 --> 33:54.629
And until, of course,
Apollo came along,

33:54.631 --> 33:56.498
claimed all the
credit for himself.

33:56.500 --> 34:00.669
Surprise surprise, 'twas
ever thus the patriarchy.

34:00.671 --> 34:02.403
It's a lovely spot.

34:02.405 --> 34:03.838
Claiming credit.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.673
Very spiritual, isn't it?

34:05.675 --> 34:06.842
Yeah.

34:15.552 --> 34:18.920
Michelin
starred, Varoulko Seaside

34:18.922 --> 34:21.925
in Pireas, Athens
is widely regarded

34:23.092 --> 34:26.630
as Greece's top
seafood restaurant.

34:37.474 --> 34:38.672
Well it's very nice, isn't it?

34:38.675 --> 34:40.842
This is not what I
expected of Athens.

34:40.844 --> 34:42.878
I was thinking hot and
dusty, not wet and cool.

34:42.880 --> 34:46.414
No, well, this is exactly
what I expected of Athens

34:46.416 --> 34:49.751
because lots of boats,
because it's a naval power.

34:49.753 --> 34:52.652
The Athenian Navy
defeated the Persians in

34:52.655 --> 34:55.090
the Battle of Salamis.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.525
The Battle of Salamis.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.026
Yeah.

34:58.028 --> 34:59.860
So, you could do something
about two guys with Salamis

34:59.862 --> 35:00.795
hitting each other in the head?

35:00.797 --> 35:02.229
- Yes.
- The fact that Salamis

35:02.231 --> 35:03.300
are a bit like cocks.

35:04.467 --> 35:05.400
Yeah, no,
I wasn't going there

35:05.402 --> 35:06.834
- but
- Really?

35:06.836 --> 35:07.635
- Well, the Battle of Salamis
- The Battle of Salamis.

35:07.637 --> 35:08.836
Big guy.

35:08.838 --> 35:10.805
Yeah but they're at
the Battle of Marathon,

35:10.807 --> 35:13.441
not far from here, that
wasn't a naval battle, was it?

35:13.443 --> 35:14.976
I didn't say all the
battles were naval.

35:14.978 --> 35:17.811
And that's where we get the
Marathon from because the guy,

35:17.813 --> 35:21.550
the soldier came, he ran
from the battle at Marathon,

35:21.552 --> 35:24.153
all the way back to Athens
and then, you won't know this,

35:24.155 --> 35:25.420
he dropped dead.

35:25.422 --> 35:27.021
What did the shout
just before he died?

35:27.023 --> 35:28.958
He said, "I've got
shooting pains down my arm

35:28.960 --> 35:30.425
and I sort of,

35:30.427 --> 35:31.693
followed by a crushing
feeling across my chest."

35:31.695 --> 35:33.061
No, Nike.

35:33.063 --> 35:34.061
- Please.
- What?

35:34.063 --> 35:34.963
Thank you.

35:39.068 --> 35:40.334
Thank you very much.

35:40.336 --> 35:42.306
salad from
white grouper.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.476
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:46.844 --> 35:48.976
He shouted Nike.

35:48.978 --> 35:50.211
He had a sponsorship deal.

35:50.213 --> 35:51.880
He wanted to thank
the guys at Nike.

35:51.882 --> 35:54.684
No, he shouted Nike as Nike
is the goddess of victory.

36:00.757 --> 36:02.356
Have you ever ran the marathon?

36:02.358 --> 36:04.291
No, of course not, no.

36:04.293 --> 36:05.762
- I have.
- Really?

36:07.130 --> 36:09.229
If you died at the end of the
marathon, I would gladly try

36:09.231 --> 36:11.132
and resuscitate you, to the...

36:11.134 --> 36:13.334
Are you waving goodbye to me.

36:13.336 --> 36:15.170
No, I'm crashing your
chest to the rhythm

36:15.172 --> 36:16.639
of staying alive.

36:16.641 --> 36:19.476
You don't do that, you
don't pat someone in the back.

36:20.543 --> 36:22.712
Arms together, elbows locked.

36:23.847 --> 36:26.347
Push down, 30
chest compressions.

36:26.349 --> 36:28.182
30 and you count them.

36:28.184 --> 36:33.190
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10

36:33.757 --> 36:34.923
to 30 of those.

36:34.925 --> 36:35.757
Steve's gonna die.

36:35.759 --> 36:36.791
Steve's gonna die.

36:36.793 --> 36:38.459
- Then two breaths.
- Yeah.

36:38.461 --> 36:40.528
Pinch the nose, head
back, two breaths.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.130
- Not your nose.
- What?

36:42.132 --> 36:43.599
The nose of the person

36:43.601 --> 36:44.766
- your bringing to life.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

36:44.768 --> 36:45.566
- Head back.
- We've lost him.

36:45.568 --> 36:46.800
Something on his neck.

36:46.802 --> 36:49.304
We've lost him but
I'm pinching my nose.

36:49.306 --> 36:51.371
"Not your nose, you idiot."

36:51.373 --> 36:53.342
Well, it's 'cause
you make people laugh

36:53.344 --> 36:56.211
while losing valuable
seconds, that will be good.

36:56.213 --> 36:57.479
What if you'd found it funny

36:57.481 --> 36:58.880
and you sprung back
to life laughing.

36:58.882 --> 37:02.383
Well, I'd have to be
conscious for that to happen.

37:02.385 --> 37:03.552
So, if I'm conscious
then there's

37:03.554 --> 37:04.753
no need to resuscitate me.

37:04.755 --> 37:05.554
- Doesn't make sense.
- All right,

37:05.556 --> 37:06.755
I'm banging your chest

37:06.757 --> 37:08.222
- Can I?
- Pinch the nose,

37:08.224 --> 37:09.356
- Would you mind if I...
- two breaths, then 30 more.

37:09.358 --> 37:12.230
- One, two, three, four
- Three, four.

37:13.429 --> 37:15.432
Steve's gonna die,
Steve's gonna die.

37:16.733 --> 37:18.467
Yeah and why do
they say do it to

37:18.469 --> 37:20.302
the beat of the Bee Gees?

37:20.304 --> 37:21.735
Why?

37:21.737 --> 37:22.970
Because it's the number
of beats per minute.

37:22.972 --> 37:24.271
And how many beats
per minute is it?

37:24.273 --> 37:25.373
A hundred and twenty.

37:25.375 --> 37:26.675
Yes.

37:26.677 --> 37:27.842
'cause that's the
classic disco beat.

37:27.844 --> 37:29.378
Yes, I know.

37:29.380 --> 37:32.713
Then we got a very dangerous
area because then it might be

37:32.715 --> 37:33.882
time to try mouth to mouth

37:33.884 --> 37:36.584
and I would not be
comfortable with that.

37:36.586 --> 37:39.253
I'm glad you wouldn't
be comfortable with it.

37:39.255 --> 37:42.055
I would find it hard to
press my lips to yours.

37:42.057 --> 37:43.592
I'm glad you wouldn't
be comfortable with it

37:43.594 --> 37:46.097
'cause I enjoy it more when
you don't enjoy it.

37:55.505 --> 37:59.807
Marathon man, Dustin
Hoffman, very different actors.

37:59.809 --> 38:01.443
Olivier acts from
the outside-in,

38:01.445 --> 38:03.711
he's not a method
actor, he never was.

38:03.713 --> 38:07.215
He likes to look in the
mirror and look like someone

38:07.217 --> 38:11.385
different, and then make that
the basis of his character.

38:11.387 --> 38:12.420
Or a Dustin nose.

38:12.422 --> 38:13.921
Dustin doesn't look like that

38:13.923 --> 38:15.090
I think I'm quite like Dustin.

38:15.092 --> 38:16.590
And I'm not sure
act the like Dustin.

38:16.592 --> 38:18.128
Well that's Dustin Hoffman.

38:21.231 --> 38:22.930
Mrs. Robinson, are
you trying to seduce me?

38:22.932 --> 38:25.333
Are you trying to
seduce me Mrs. Robinson?

38:25.335 --> 38:28.503
- Mrs. Robinson.
- Are you trying to seduce me?

38:28.505 --> 38:30.338
Then pick what
do you choose next.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.706
I'll tell you Midnight Cowboy.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.508
Why did he choose
that John Schlesinger?

38:33.510 --> 38:34.476
'cause he was so different.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.709
Who did he play?

38:35.711 --> 38:37.479
Ratso Rizzo, who
was opposite him?

38:37.481 --> 38:38.813
- Jon Voight.
- Jon Voight, yeah.

38:38.815 --> 38:40.715
Jon Voight the

38:40.717 --> 38:41.983
We didn't know that then.

38:41.985 --> 38:45.586
Jon Voight says, "Well
hell, I'm a hustler,

38:45.588 --> 38:46.854
you didn't know that?"

38:48.291 --> 38:49.523
Justin says," Well, how I'm
I supposed to know that?

38:49.525 --> 38:50.724
You gotta tell a
person these things.

38:50.726 --> 38:52.626
I mean, I understand
the board starts crying

38:52.628 --> 38:54.461
and I cut my heart out for her.

38:54.463 --> 38:55.829
You need my friend, Dr. Aniel."

38:55.831 --> 38:56.999
- Can you do...
- I'm haven't finished

38:57.001 --> 38:58.432
- doing it yet.
- Okay.

38:58.434 --> 38:59.767
"You need my friend Dr. Aniel.

38:59.769 --> 39:01.302
- He runs a biggest..."
- That's very good.

39:01.304 --> 39:02.836
I still haven't finished.

39:02.838 --> 39:04.371
"You will need my
friend Dr. Aniel.

39:04.373 --> 39:05.840
He runs this biggest...

39:05.842 --> 39:08.709
now I'm getting it wrong 'cause
you got in my fucking way.

39:08.711 --> 39:10.878
I'm walking here,
I'm walking here.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.715
While I'm talking here, let me
finish this thing, right now.

39:13.717 --> 39:16.385
You'll need my friend Dr. Aniel,
he runs the biggest stable

39:16.387 --> 39:18.720
in the whole goddamn
metropolitan area.

39:18.722 --> 39:20.591
It's craziest stuff
like you paying."

39:22.092 --> 39:24.459
And then there was

39:24.461 --> 39:25.726
I can do that.

39:25.728 --> 39:26.927
Michael, nobody
will employ you.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.429
You played a tomato,
they went two days over

39:28.431 --> 39:29.932
'cause you wouldn't sit down.

39:29.934 --> 39:32.400
I'm a woman, I don't like
the way you speak to one.

39:32.402 --> 39:34.668
If you say that again, me I
go knock balls right through

39:34.670 --> 39:35.804
the roof of your mouth.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.237
I'm not Dorothy Michaels.

39:37.239 --> 39:38.541
I'm not Dorothy Michaels.

39:39.775 --> 39:41.141
- I'm Michael Dorcy.
- I'm Michael Dorcy.

39:46.583 --> 39:48.182
I'm an excellent driver.

39:48.184 --> 39:49.184
I'm an, okay.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.753
I'm an excellent driver.

39:51.755 --> 39:54.759
Can you do a Godzilla
animation in a film?

39:56.126 --> 39:57.726
Kind of like a stop
frame animation.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.795
- No.
- I can, watch.

40:14.510 --> 40:16.211
Still prefer O'Neil Kinect.

40:16.213 --> 40:18.512
If I had to choose
with a gun to my head.

40:18.514 --> 40:21.083
And I can do
doubling in films where

40:21.085 --> 40:22.150
the voice doesn't matter.

40:22.152 --> 40:23.318
You've done this before.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.353
I know, it's
good though, watch.

40:25.355 --> 40:26.186
Are you gonna do it?

40:26.188 --> 40:27.023
Yeah.

40:28.525 --> 40:29.757
Don't be ridiculous.

40:29.759 --> 40:32.459
And I told you time
and time again.

40:32.461 --> 40:35.831
Every time you come here,
your voice didn't sink at all

40:35.833 --> 40:38.967
and when you lose your temper,
it should be like this.

40:38.969 --> 40:40.334
Hey, you.

40:40.336 --> 40:41.903
You're a fool.

40:41.905 --> 40:43.774
Fair enough.

40:45.208 --> 40:47.309
In the Marathon Man of course,
in that scene where he says,

40:47.311 --> 40:48.177
"Is it safe?"

40:48.179 --> 40:49.213
Is it safe?

40:51.148 --> 40:52.380
Is it safe?

40:52.382 --> 40:53.882
Yes, it's safe.

40:53.884 --> 40:55.650
Is it safe, yes,
it's very safe.

40:55.652 --> 40:56.885
Are you doing both parts?

40:56.887 --> 40:58.086
Is it safe?

40:58.088 --> 41:00.255
It's safe, it's safe, yeah.

41:00.257 --> 41:01.789
Does this hurt?

41:02.626 --> 41:03.427
You have a cavity.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.561
See, that's where
you got it wrong,

41:07.563 --> 41:08.796
'cause he doesn't do that.

41:08.798 --> 41:10.264
The whole point
is, he doesn't go

41:10.266 --> 41:11.465
- Does he?
- Okay, all right.

41:11.467 --> 41:12.733
He's very, that's
what makes it scary

41:12.735 --> 41:14.635
'cause he does it
ever so gently,

41:14.637 --> 41:16.905
he's like a dentist and
that's why it's ahead

41:16.907 --> 41:19.840
because he's so, now
try it again, Steve.

41:19.842 --> 41:21.008
I want you for this part.

41:21.010 --> 41:23.713
You have a slight
cavity there.

41:25.048 --> 41:26.050
- Just
- Oh!

41:28.318 --> 41:29.583
And then you get
the oil of cloves.

41:29.585 --> 41:32.186
- Yes, simple...
- But you do it very caringly.

41:32.188 --> 41:34.757
Simple oil of cloves.

41:35.858 --> 41:37.961
It makes it so much better.

41:39.762 --> 41:42.664
That's not safe, it's not
safe, it's very dangerous.

41:45.802 --> 41:46.800
What are you doing now?

41:46.802 --> 41:47.668
- You're drilling?
- Yeah, well.

41:54.878 --> 41:57.211
I'm a little lightheaded.

41:57.213 --> 41:59.113
That was actually quite good.

41:59.115 --> 42:00.581
It was, I'll do it again.

42:13.128 --> 42:15.465
And then from deep inside
Dustin's mouth comes this;

42:17.599 --> 42:18.432
"somebody get me out of here,

42:18.434 --> 42:19.601
I'm a tiny tooth,

42:19.603 --> 42:21.436
I can't get out of
Dustin Hoffman's mouth,

42:21.438 --> 42:24.472
oh my God, I can't get
out of Dustin's mouth"

42:24.474 --> 42:27.944
He didn't see some sort
of wise guy, that he's not.

42:30.512 --> 42:33.046
I still don't
know why you dubbed.

42:33.048 --> 42:34.416
And why are you a
small man in the box?

42:34.418 --> 42:36.050
Oh, he's a funny
notion that I'm not,

42:36.052 --> 42:39.253
- I'm small...
- It's a funny notion

42:39.255 --> 42:42.057
that someone might walk around
in real life being dubbed.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.425
- Yeah, but in this...
- To make sense.

42:43.427 --> 42:45.226
- In this instance...
- A small, why a small...

42:45.228 --> 42:47.394
Because we're in
a dental setting.

42:47.396 --> 42:49.829
And a man's trapped in
a box, why in the dentist?

42:49.831 --> 42:52.099
A tooth is trapped in a mouth.

42:52.101 --> 42:54.001
And the tooth talks.

42:54.003 --> 42:55.670
I'm trapped inside
Dustin Hoffman's mouth.

42:55.672 --> 42:57.438
Well, this is where
your claim for logic

42:57.440 --> 42:59.507
falls to the ground,
Mr. Rob Brydon.

42:59.509 --> 43:02.276
There's no possible way of
offering the explanation

43:02.278 --> 43:03.947
for that, case dismissed.

43:07.416 --> 43:10.851
So, it's your first
visit in our hotel, sir?

43:10.853 --> 43:12.420
First visit to
this hotel, yes.

43:12.422 --> 43:15.222
But visited Athens a
couple of times before.

43:15.224 --> 43:16.124
Hello.

43:16.126 --> 43:16.958
Hello.

43:16.960 --> 43:17.925
How are you?

43:17.927 --> 43:19.860
Nice to hear your voice.

43:19.862 --> 43:21.197
Hey, Greg, how you doing?

43:22.231 --> 43:23.298
How are you?

43:23.300 --> 43:24.565
Good, good, yeah, great.

43:24.567 --> 43:25.900
How's Rob?

43:25.902 --> 43:26.733
Is he keeping you on your toes?

43:26.735 --> 43:27.735
He's a very funny man.

43:27.737 --> 43:29.403
He really does

43:29.405 --> 43:31.706
Yes, he's very funny.

43:31.708 --> 43:33.175
Well, what can I do for you?

43:33.177 --> 43:36.043
Is there any news on
the Damien Chazelle film?

43:36.045 --> 43:39.380
Yes, yes but it's a no,
I'm afraid, from them.

43:39.382 --> 43:41.516
They do what, they loved you.

43:41.518 --> 43:44.251
They thought what you did
was absolutely fantastic.

43:44.253 --> 43:49.090
I cried and I
did the whole bit.

43:49.092 --> 43:51.693
Yeah, I know that though
the crying was great.

43:51.695 --> 43:53.528
They mentioned
that, they loved it.

43:53.530 --> 43:55.130
Listen, I've had an idea.

43:55.132 --> 43:59.133
Why don't you at the end
of this, which is Ithica,

43:59.135 --> 44:02.235
why don't you come
out and you and I

44:02.237 --> 44:04.307
could have a few days together?

44:14.385 --> 44:15.215
Here they are.

44:15.217 --> 44:16.217
- Hello.
- Hello.

44:16.219 --> 44:17.418
Hey, how are you?

44:17.420 --> 44:20.088
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you again.

44:20.090 --> 44:21.389
Nice to see you too.

44:21.391 --> 44:22.356
- You all right?
- Yeah.

44:22.358 --> 44:23.590
- How are you?
- Very good.

44:23.592 --> 44:25.226
Nice to see you.

44:25.228 --> 44:26.961
- Fantastic.
- Thank you.

44:26.963 --> 44:28.295
Right, a photograph.

44:28.297 --> 44:31.099
Yes, at the
Epidaurus, the theatre.

44:31.101 --> 44:33.836
Since Greece is the
birthplace of drama.

44:34.737 --> 44:35.670
On the nose.

44:35.672 --> 44:36.907
Steven it was your idea.

44:37.873 --> 44:39.208
- Was it?
- Yeah.

44:40.677 --> 44:41.675
Great, let's do it.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.987
It's hot, if
I was to give one word

44:51.989 --> 44:53.257
to describe this weather.

45:01.264 --> 45:02.095
That's very hot.

45:02.097 --> 45:02.930
I know it's hot.

45:02.932 --> 45:03.764
Masks.

45:03.766 --> 45:05.333
Comedy, tragedy.

45:05.335 --> 45:06.467
This is,
they look like BAFTAs

45:06.469 --> 45:08.336
Is that the idea?

45:08.338 --> 45:10.237
They are,
the unfamiliar not.

45:10.239 --> 45:12.307
I've got tragedy,
you happy with that?

45:12.309 --> 45:13.474
Comedy?

45:13.476 --> 45:14.275
I don't know,
what do you think?

45:14.277 --> 45:15.677
I'd go with that.

45:15.679 --> 45:17.144
Comedy, you know
you're a titan of comedy.

45:17.146 --> 45:18.880
I should have the smile
because of the number

45:18.882 --> 45:20.180
of BAFTAs I've won.

45:20.182 --> 45:21.548
And I should have the
frown because I've spent

45:21.550 --> 45:22.416
a week with you.

45:22.418 --> 45:23.717
Come on, let's do it.

45:23.719 --> 45:27.588
On the other hand, Rob
is known for accessible

45:27.590 --> 45:31.925
light entertainment, smiley
face, and I'm now known

45:31.927 --> 45:36.030
for dramatic roles because

45:36.032 --> 45:38.800
I got a BAFTA nomination for,

45:38.802 --> 45:40.334
thanks, Stan Laurel.

45:40.336 --> 45:43.570
For impersonating a comedian,
so we give it back to you.

45:43.572 --> 45:45.206
Yeah, I wasn't
impersonating a comedian,

45:45.208 --> 45:47.842
because BAFTA, the nomination
was for best acting.

45:47.844 --> 45:50.043
It's certainly drama.

45:50.045 --> 45:51.947
Guys, can you
take off the hats?

45:51.949 --> 45:52.880
- What?
- Hat.

45:52.882 --> 45:53.882
Okay.

45:53.884 --> 45:55.383
I'm gonna burn
without the hat.

45:55.385 --> 45:56.349
Okay, well, we'll
do it quickly.

45:56.351 --> 45:58.353
Why is he on the higher level?

45:58.355 --> 46:00.588
This is just exacerbating
the height thing.

46:00.590 --> 46:02.090
You can go on the same level.

46:02.092 --> 46:04.258
I don't think Rob could
be on the same level.

46:04.260 --> 46:07.595
Oh, he's talking, physically,
I see, I've got it, okay.

46:07.597 --> 46:09.731
Try and do like the
proper Greek actors

46:09.733 --> 46:11.331
like a proper drama.

46:11.333 --> 46:13.133
As if we're all Greek
actors, so, I'll stab you.

46:13.135 --> 46:14.401
That will come easy.

46:14.403 --> 46:16.970
Yeah, some kind of
drama there, yeah.

46:16.972 --> 46:20.941
Sing Goddess Achilles
rage, black and murderous,

46:20.943 --> 46:23.276
that cost the Greeks
incalculable pain,

46:23.278 --> 46:24.378
and cast countless

46:24.380 --> 46:26.380
souls of heroes into Hades'

46:26.382 --> 46:28.416
black, dark, pitched.

46:28.418 --> 46:30.420
Hey, I'm from BAFTA

46:31.722 --> 46:35.856
and I'm afraid, your

Yeah, but it's not

That's just depression.

46:57.213 --> 46:59.313
That's what a doctor would
say but Barry's not a doctor.

46:59.315 --> 47:01.148

47:19.668 --> 47:21.501
We're about to pull in.

47:21.503 --> 47:23.840
Great, all right, that's fab.

47:37.052 --> 47:39.253
Oh hi, nice to meet you?

47:39.255 --> 47:40.889
How are you doing?

47:40.891 --> 47:42.057
So, you're gonna meet
them tomorrow with the car

47:42.059 --> 47:43.060
in Monemvasia

47:43.425 --> 47:44.791
Yes, okay.

47:46.528 --> 47:47.762
Where does the ferry go from?

47:47.764 --> 47:48.929
The ferry is down there.

47:48.931 --> 47:49.764
Okay.

47:49.766 --> 47:50.965
Have a good time.

47:50.967 --> 47:51.965
Bye ,
thank you so much.

47:54.271 --> 47:55.603
There's no cars
allowed though in Hydra.

47:55.605 --> 47:56.570
Really?

47:56.572 --> 47:57.838
- Yeah.
- That is good.

47:57.840 --> 47:59.509
Yeah, it is good.

48:29.505 --> 48:30.737
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:30.739 --> 48:32.173
I can take your bags?

48:32.175 --> 48:35.008
Oh, amazing, we're
gonna stay at the Hydrea.

48:35.010 --> 48:35.842
- Yes.
- Where's the Hydrea?

48:35.844 --> 48:36.776
It's over there.

48:36.778 --> 48:38.045
- Okay.
- Very near.

48:38.047 --> 48:38.880
Can you take us
to the reception?

48:38.882 --> 48:40.217
Okay, brilliant.

48:50.260 --> 48:51.862
So, here we have,

48:53.795 --> 48:57.000
- Wow, amazing.
- Wow, it looks amazing.

48:58.434 --> 48:59.800
Delicious, thank you.

49:02.838 --> 49:04.338
How are your kids Rob?

49:04.340 --> 49:05.972
Good, thank you.

49:05.974 --> 49:08.943
Chloe is ten, Charlie is four.

49:08.945 --> 49:11.378
- Wow.
- There are a handful.

49:11.380 --> 49:12.347
well.

49:12.349 --> 49:13.914
How is yours?

49:13.916 --> 49:15.483
is four.

49:15.485 --> 49:18.186
Would you have another one,
do you think, at your age now?

49:18.188 --> 49:20.153
I just think a certain
age, it's probably

49:20.155 --> 49:22.088
- not fair on the kids, is it?
- Yeah.

49:22.090 --> 49:23.757
Keep you young
though, look at Jagger.

49:23.759 --> 49:26.894
Have you seen that clip of him
after he had his operation.

49:26.896 --> 49:27.795
I've seen that,
where he's dancing.

49:27.797 --> 49:28.963
Where he's dancing, yeah.

49:28.965 --> 49:30.164
He's amazing.

49:30.166 --> 49:31.465
How long was it
after his operation?

49:31.467 --> 49:32.499
I don't know, not
a lot clear though.

49:32.501 --> 49:33.566
But pretty soon after,

49:33.568 --> 49:35.637
- Really?
- it's very incredible.

49:35.639 --> 49:36.838
Lemme have a look.

49:36.840 --> 49:37.771
But he has many
young children, right?

49:37.773 --> 49:39.007
So, he needs to keep fit.

49:39.009 --> 49:40.340
Pretty soon, he'll be
the only man in Britain

49:40.342 --> 49:42.443
with an earlier
bedtime than his child.

49:44.947 --> 49:46.146
I don't want to go to bed.

49:46.148 --> 49:48.548
I want to stay up, I
want to watch one show.

49:48.550 --> 49:49.684
Please share that nappies.

49:49.686 --> 49:51.351
Oh hang on, he's found it.

49:51.353 --> 49:52.586
I hope he has, either that

49:52.588 --> 49:54.555
or he's having some
sort of a fit.

49:54.557 --> 49:55.555
On the screen off.

49:55.557 --> 49:58.258
Oh, it'll work, don't worry.

49:58.260 --> 49:59.929
Impressive though, right?

50:03.298 --> 50:05.132
Imagine him in the hospital.

50:05.134 --> 50:08.137
Can I just say, this ward
is a lot really noisy and

50:09.572 --> 50:10.737
oh, keep it down.

50:10.739 --> 50:13.039
Well time is it you know.

50:13.041 --> 50:14.175
When's the magazines
coming around?

50:14.177 --> 50:15.675
I could use this one.

50:15.677 --> 50:18.711
See that bloke in the
next bed, he's done nothing

50:18.713 --> 50:20.180
but complain since he got there.

50:20.182 --> 50:21.018
The nurses,

50:23.152 --> 50:24.818
they're like angels.

50:24.820 --> 50:27.722
And he does nothing
but complain.

50:32.195 --> 50:36.396
And him over there, he has
no visitors, really sad.

50:36.398 --> 50:38.432
No one's going to see him.

50:38.434 --> 50:40.601
All right, hello?

50:40.603 --> 50:42.838
You're doing all right, yeah.

50:44.072 --> 50:46.440
Do you think he was
on the ward at Papworth?

50:46.442 --> 50:47.275
- I doubt it somehow.
- Probably

50:47.277 --> 50:48.842
in the private room.

50:48.844 --> 50:50.110
- Yeah.
- Most likely.

50:50.112 --> 50:51.345
Nevermind, can't
get no satisfaction.

50:51.347 --> 50:53.380
I can't get no sleep,
the bloody noise.

50:53.382 --> 50:54.648
That one over there.

50:54.650 --> 50:57.552
He's boning and
groaning all night.

50:57.554 --> 50:59.987
- Oh, it's so in terms...
- No wonder you don't get

50:59.989 --> 51:02.590
any visitors, I mean,
it's a nightmare.

51:02.592 --> 51:04.092
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:04.094 --> 51:06.126
But you know, Keith's come
to visit and Ronnie's come

51:06.128 --> 51:07.695
to visit.

51:07.697 --> 51:09.930
- haven't they?
- Charlie's come to visit.

51:09.932 --> 51:11.566
What?

51:11.568 --> 51:13.066
- No, no.
- No.

51:13.068 --> 51:14.668
It's like me and him, we
get on, we love each other.

51:14.670 --> 51:17.604
We a little

51:17.606 --> 51:18.840
He said he had a
tiny todger though,

51:18.842 --> 51:20.008
isn't that too hard
to come back from?

51:20.010 --> 51:22.275
No, that's Steve
lying

51:22.277 --> 51:23.543
Did he forget he
probably when he said that?

51:23.545 --> 51:24.711
Sometimes.

51:24.713 --> 51:26.546
Well, he would
know it wasn't true...

51:26.548 --> 51:29.217
These cats

51:29.219 --> 51:32.586
When he goes swimming, right,
like when he's facing down,

51:32.588 --> 51:34.222
it's like he's
dredging, you know.

51:34.224 --> 51:37.057
- He's like he's...
- Oh God.

51:37.059 --> 51:39.628
That's what Keith
Richards did when he laughs.

51:40.463 --> 51:41.762
Just wondered...

51:41.764 --> 51:43.463
He's like in the last
death throes of Mutley.

51:52.141 --> 51:52.840
He's loving
it, isn't he?

51:52.842 --> 51:53.840
Look at that.

51:53.842 --> 51:54.807
I could do that.

51:54.809 --> 51:56.311
That's actually quite risky.

51:56.313 --> 51:57.278
Did I tell
you about the time

51:57.280 --> 51:59.045
I free climbed home crack.

51:59.047 --> 52:00.715
Yes, you did.

52:00.717 --> 52:01.648
What is he doing?

52:01.650 --> 52:03.217
- Wow.
- Wow.

52:03.219 --> 52:04.751
Oh my god.

52:04.753 --> 52:07.253
He could be nastily
thrown against the rocks.

52:07.255 --> 52:08.188
Couldn't be that.

52:08.190 --> 52:09.590
So, and here we come.

52:09.592 --> 52:10.624
Oh, wow.

52:10.626 --> 52:11.758
Here we have shell fishes.

52:11.760 --> 52:12.795
Thank you.

52:15.731 --> 52:17.798
- That looks so good.
- Thank you.

52:17.800 --> 52:18.633
It looks lovely.

52:18.635 --> 52:19.800
Amazing.

52:19.802 --> 52:21.101
Oh, this reminds me
when the tide goes out.

52:21.103 --> 52:22.302
Are we meant to just
slurp it like an oyster?

52:22.304 --> 52:24.104
You don't have to.

52:24.106 --> 52:25.505
What did you do?

52:25.507 --> 52:26.507
You still do
that, you still do it like,

52:26.509 --> 52:28.844
Yeah, I think we do.

52:30.179 --> 52:31.278
It's
smaller than garlic.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.679
That is amazing.

52:32.681 --> 52:33.549
That's gorgeous.

52:35.050 --> 52:36.650
I might
go for a dive later.

52:36.652 --> 52:38.086
Really?

52:38.088 --> 52:39.820
Yeah, but I can't do a
back flip like that but I can

52:39.822 --> 52:41.088
swallow dive.

52:41.090 --> 52:42.523
What's swallow dive?

52:42.525 --> 52:44.726
Well, you have to put
your arms out like this

52:44.728 --> 52:47.594
because if you do this, if
you're from a great height,

52:47.596 --> 52:49.697
if you do this, you just
go over to your back.

52:49.699 --> 52:51.798
So you have to, the centre
of gravity is your chest

52:51.800 --> 52:55.635
by doing this, and then bring
your arms in the last minute.

52:55.637 --> 52:56.470
Okay.

52:57.438 --> 52:58.438
Hey, Chloe, how are you doing?

52:58.440 --> 52:59.675
You all right?

53:00.610 --> 53:01.842
Hi, I'm good.

53:01.844 --> 53:04.112
Good, how was school today?

53:04.114 --> 53:06.479
Hey Joe, it's dad.

53:06.481 --> 53:09.016
Hey dad, I've just
been to see Grandad.

53:09.018 --> 53:10.516
All right, go on.

53:10.518 --> 53:14.420
He's a bit woozy, they're
going to run a few more tests.

53:14.422 --> 53:16.725
You're gonna miss
mommy when she comes out.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.059
Yeah.

53:19.061 --> 53:20.628
We're gonna get
back in the same flight.

53:20.630 --> 53:22.766
Brilliant, that's good.

53:25.635 --> 53:27.668
Oh, great, how is she?

53:27.670 --> 53:28.769
She's good, yeah.

53:28.771 --> 53:30.070
She said to say hello.

53:30.072 --> 53:33.340
Okay, well say
hello back to her,

53:33.342 --> 53:37.711
and thank you for obviously you
know stepping into the fray.

53:37.713 --> 53:40.048
It'll be fun the
granny though, won't it?

53:40.050 --> 53:41.882
Yeah, good forehead
darling well done.

53:41.884 --> 53:42.719
Hello.

53:56.097 --> 53:57.099
Good luck.

53:57.932 --> 54:00.300
Oh, Miss Jones.

54:00.302 --> 54:03.237
Miss Jones you look
wonderful tonight Miss Jones.

54:03.239 --> 54:05.204
Thank, as do you.

54:05.206 --> 54:09.209
The Himalayas,
unmistakable Miss Jones.

54:09.211 --> 54:11.711
Would you join me Miss Jones
in the terrace for a drink?

54:11.713 --> 54:12.646
I was just wondering where

54:12.648 --> 54:14.217
Leonard Cohen's house might be

54:15.652 --> 54:17.150
near the house and I think
he's got a blue plaque.

54:17.152 --> 54:18.586
Leonard Cohen lived here.

54:18.588 --> 54:19.920
Oh, yes, I would think so.

54:19.922 --> 54:24.927
I mean, Leonard and
McCartney

54:28.396 --> 54:29.231
Bravo.

54:33.168 --> 54:36.235
It's not really high though
to see a proper swallow dive.

54:36.237 --> 54:37.972
No, I think that was perfect.

54:37.974 --> 54:41.342
Actually, it's a
very difficult dive.

54:41.344 --> 54:44.047
So, you gotta watch
your back, you see.

54:45.447 --> 54:47.380
If you don't get the
right entry, it's lethal.

54:47.382 --> 54:48.217
Yeah.

54:49.418 --> 54:52.385
And then they're gonna
have fireworks, anytime.

54:52.387 --> 54:53.586
How do you know?

54:53.588 --> 54:55.222
Because I have
been here before.

54:55.224 --> 54:57.727
Oh, so you've been this far.

56:02.291 --> 56:03.923
I have to get to the ferry.

56:03.925 --> 56:04.728

57:30.813 --> 57:31.845

57:31.847 --> 57:33.380
You used falsetto.

57:33.382 --> 57:38.421
Did I talk over you doing
it and tell you how to do it?

57:39.489 --> 57:40.153
- No.
- No, because you don't know

57:40.155 --> 57:41.354
how to do it.

57:41.356 --> 57:43.057
'cause well, I was
gonna say it's falsetto.

57:43.059 --> 57:44.791
He went into falsetto.

57:44.793 --> 57:47.528
Yes he went into it but I
haven't reached that stage yet.

57:47.530 --> 57:49.563
- Well you did.
- He didn't start in falsetto.

57:49.565 --> 57:50.764
- Did he, Steve?
- No.

57:50.766 --> 57:52.333
- Did I start in falsetto?
- No.

57:52.335 --> 57:53.501
So I was doing
the same as Denis.

57:53.503 --> 57:55.401
When you go high
note, you also remained

57:55.403 --> 57:57.570
- out of falsetto.
- Car.

57:58.673 --> 57:59.539
- Here we go.
- Even the high note.

57:59.541 --> 58:01.008
Right, here we go.

58:01.010 --> 58:03.177
How about you do a sponsored
silence now for charity.

58:03.179 --> 58:05.479

58:55.398 --> 58:57.430
You're all over the place.

58:57.432 --> 59:00.135
Shocked by the
power of my falsetto.

59:09.445 --> 59:10.709
- Hello.
- Hey, hello.

59:10.711 --> 59:13.179
- You all right?
- Yeah, very good thank you.

59:13.181 --> 59:14.715
Is everything sorted?

59:14.717 --> 59:17.320
It is, Emmy's organised it
all, she says it'll be fine.

59:19.021 --> 59:21.255
- Hello?
- Hey, Catherine.

59:21.257 --> 59:24.925
It's Steve, how are you?

59:24.927 --> 59:26.260
Yeah, I'm fine, thank you.

59:26.262 --> 59:27.728
What can I do for you?

59:27.730 --> 59:29.563
I'm trying to get Joe, he's
not answering his mobile.

59:29.565 --> 59:31.132
Is he there?

59:31.134 --> 59:33.235
Yeah, yeah.

59:35.471 --> 59:38.405
I'm sorry about
your dad by the way.

59:38.407 --> 59:40.005
Oh thank you, yeah.

59:40.007 --> 59:41.675
Joe is here, have
a chat with him.

59:41.677 --> 59:42.943
Take care, okay, bye.

59:42.945 --> 59:44.043
Thanks, love.

59:44.045 --> 59:46.012
Thanks.
Hey, Dad.

59:46.014 --> 59:47.049
Hey, how you doing?

59:48.217 --> 59:50.016
Yeah, I'm all
right, how are you?

59:50.018 --> 59:52.720
Great, great, how's granddad.

59:52.722 --> 59:54.354
Oh, he's okay.

59:54.356 --> 59:55.755
You know, I mean,
same as yesterday.

59:55.757 --> 59:58.057
He seems he seems stable.

01:00:06.268 --> 01:00:08.001
What's amazing about the Mani
is that thousands years ago

01:00:08.003 --> 01:00:11.338
when it was ruled by, when
Sparta was the most powerful

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.374
nation state in ancient Greece.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.708
To be part of the
ruling council,

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.211
you had to be over 60 years
old, so I will be too young

01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:21.315
to be part of the government.

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:24.650
I'd be like some young
rapscallion, the ruling council

01:00:24.652 --> 01:00:26.887
there in the robes,
the elders, very wise,

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:28.155
and I'd be hanging
around and they're going,

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:31.258
"Get out of here. Steve,
you silly young thing."

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.126
Would you ever run
for public office?

01:00:33.128 --> 01:00:34.628
No.

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:35.795
Because you'd be a great
orator, wouldn't you?

01:00:35.797 --> 01:00:38.465
With your skills of speaking.

01:00:38.467 --> 01:00:39.302
I don't.

01:00:42.003 --> 01:00:44.237
You worried they'd be
digging through your past?

01:00:44.239 --> 01:00:46.171
No, I don't, I'm not
worried about that.

01:00:46.173 --> 01:00:48.141
Because that's a pro nowadays.

01:00:48.143 --> 01:00:51.043
I mean, look at look at
some of these people.

01:00:51.045 --> 01:00:52.945
Look at your Trump's
and your Johnson's.

01:00:52.947 --> 01:00:54.180
Yeah.
You're old and stuff.

01:00:54.182 --> 01:00:55.382
Yeah, well, you know,

01:00:55.384 --> 01:00:56.849
- I mean,
- I mean not at your level but

01:00:56.851 --> 01:01:00.387
If you think about
Heracles, he was someone...

01:01:00.389 --> 01:01:02.289
Heracles, don't
you mean Hercules?

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:06.092
If you're using the Roman
name then yes, that's Hercules.

01:01:06.094 --> 01:01:07.628
I only know him from the film.

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:10.630
Okay, well, Heracles is
the Greek name for him.

01:01:10.632 --> 01:01:12.633
He murdered his
wife and children.

01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:14.668
Arnold Schwarzenegger
played him in the movie.

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:17.570
The Labours of
Hercules, if you like.

01:01:17.572 --> 01:01:19.139
Hercules in New York.

01:01:19.141 --> 01:01:20.340
Was issued from...

01:01:20.342 --> 01:01:21.974
One of the first movies.

01:01:21.976 --> 01:01:25.445
Thank you, from a Christian
perspective has based him

01:01:25.447 --> 01:01:26.847
serving his penance.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:29.249
I can't even imagine
Christianity forgiving a man

01:01:29.251 --> 01:01:30.483
for murdering his
wife and children.

01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:32.251
You're quite right too.

01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:35.255
Mr. Coogan are you suggesting
that the man standing

01:01:35.257 --> 01:01:37.958
before us today who murdered
his wife and children

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.626
should be forgiven?

01:01:39.628 --> 01:01:44.063
Hercules, Arnold played him
in Hercules in New York.

01:01:44.065 --> 01:01:44.965
Hercules in New York.

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:46.465
Is one of my first films,

01:01:46.467 --> 01:01:49.103
One of my first... you
sound a bit like

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:50.403
Werner Herzog there.

01:01:50.405 --> 01:01:51.604
That's right, that's
what I was doing.

01:01:51.606 --> 01:01:52.838
- I was doing Werner.
- That was one

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.943
of my first films, it
was very hard to do.

01:01:56.945 --> 01:02:00.548
I had to get Arnold
Schwarzenegger to do it for me.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:04.420
My name is Georgia,
everybody calls me George.

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:10.423
- Anyway.
- Remember that?

01:02:10.425 --> 01:02:14.226
So, we are going to
start with one salad.

01:02:14.228 --> 01:02:15.262
Good idea.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.133
- Thank you.
- Yeah, perfect.

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:21.168
Make some space and
put it into the middle.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:22.802
Thank you.

01:02:22.804 --> 01:02:26.338
One melitsana dip and just one
moment for the bread, please.

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.173
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:02:27.175 --> 01:02:28.008
Already enjoy.

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:29.275
Thank you.

01:02:29.277 --> 01:02:30.476
- She's charming.
- Did you hear that?

01:02:30.478 --> 01:02:32.345
- Already enjoying
- Already enjoying.

01:02:32.347 --> 01:02:33.847
- What a lovely slogan?
- Yeah, is a lovely,

01:02:33.849 --> 01:02:34.682
- yes, it is.
- I'd like to have that

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:35.518
on a T shirt.

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:37.985
- Already enjoy.
- Yeah, well, you're a bit old

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:40.387
for T-shirts with
such slogans on,

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:41.688
if you don't mind me saying.

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:43.456
- Thank you very much.
- Some bread.

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:45.258
My friend was just saying
what a lovely thing to say,

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.026
"already enjoy."

01:02:47.028 --> 01:02:48.961
Now you can enjoy
completely

01:02:48.963 --> 01:02:50.463
Match it on a T-shirt.

01:02:50.465 --> 01:02:51.630
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:02:51.632 --> 01:02:52.831
- It'd be nice.
- Yeah?

01:02:52.833 --> 01:02:55.168
He's too old to have
T shirts with logos on.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.072
You're never too
old for this.

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.005
No, I think, yeah.

01:02:59.007 --> 01:02:59.840
That's a nice thing to say.

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.173
Just to be clear.

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:02.541
- No, you're never too old.
- I know.

01:03:02.543 --> 01:03:04.478
- Enjoy.
- Thank you very much.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.679
Already enjoying, thank you.

01:03:06.681 --> 01:03:07.581
- Yeah.
- She was very,

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:08.347
she was unequivocal there.

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:09.249
Not too old.

01:03:09.251 --> 01:03:10.050
What was she gonna say?

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.584
"Yeah you're right."

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:13.920
She could have agreed with
you if you're as persuasive

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:15.755
- as you think you are.
- She was being

01:03:15.757 --> 01:03:17.190
politically adapting.

01:03:17.192 --> 01:03:18.391
That's the best thing
to say about her.

01:03:18.393 --> 01:03:19.592
Just to be clear,
are you saying,

01:03:19.594 --> 01:03:21.363
you could wear a T-shirt
with a slogan on it?

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:23.463
You think you're four months.

01:03:23.465 --> 01:03:26.331
I think, it's
nothing to do with age,

01:03:26.333 --> 01:03:27.900
it's to do with how you look.

01:03:27.902 --> 01:03:32.072
And this the brutal truth is,
yes, I think I am more likely

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:34.842
to get away with a T-shirt
with a logo on it than you are.

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:37.445
Not by much but just
more likely, yeah.

01:03:39.514 --> 01:03:41.483
Anyway, already enjoying.

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.751
- Yeah?
- Huh.

01:03:50.358 --> 01:03:53.392
The ancient Greeks recognise
that people were a combination

01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:57.463
of good and bad, is not this,
social media idea demonising

01:03:57.465 --> 01:03:58.398
people completely.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.133
They are other persona non grata

01:04:00.135 --> 01:04:02.836
or their heroic is nonsense.

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:06.209
Their gods, you know,
were complex people and

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:10.043
it's interesting because
this is a good example of it.

01:04:10.045 --> 01:04:12.315
This review of Stan and Ollie.

01:04:13.782 --> 01:04:16.352
Review of Stan and Ollie
is a good example of what?

01:04:19.054 --> 01:04:19.586
You're tying this
into Greek mythology.

01:04:19.588 --> 01:04:21.255
Yes.

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:23.456
The review of Stan and
Ollie in the Spectator says,

01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:26.693
"It's a good job Steve
Coogan is a brilliant actor.

01:04:26.695 --> 01:04:30.296
He conveys Stan's likability
so well that for 97 minutes

01:04:30.298 --> 01:04:33.266
you forget what to self
regarding arse Coogan himself is

01:04:33.268 --> 01:04:35.101
in real life." Now,

01:04:35.103 --> 01:04:38.941
my takeaway from that is, he
thinks I'm a brilliant actor.

01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:41.008
That's what you
take away from it?

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:41.844
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:56.690
That was a lovely, it was
just, it wasn't too much.

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:57.523
Did you liked it?

01:04:57.525 --> 01:04:58.691
We loved it.

01:04:58.693 --> 01:04:59.525
Wonderful, yeah, lovely.

01:04:59.527 --> 01:05:00.360
Thank you.

01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:01.193
Thank you very much.

01:05:01.195 --> 01:05:02.563
Thank you very much.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.465
Do you want to continue?

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:05.298
I think so.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.566
I think so yeah.

01:05:06.568 --> 01:05:08.170
Is there an option not to?

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:12.671
- It's your choice.
- Yeah, no, we will continue.

01:05:12.673 --> 01:05:14.340
Yeah, I've never
been asked that before.

01:05:14.342 --> 01:05:15.675
Yeah, it's a good question.

01:05:15.677 --> 01:05:17.711
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:18.547
Thank you.

01:05:19.947 --> 01:05:21.081
It's a German
accent, isn't it?

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.048
- She's got.
- Yes.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:23.148
You think she's German?

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.916
- Yeah.
- She's not Greek.

01:05:23.918 --> 01:05:25.418
Do you want to continue?

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.056
She could have been
asking us about our lives.

01:05:28.423 --> 01:05:29.688
Do you want to continue?

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:31.191
What, she's seen
our age and gone,

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:34.793
"Do you want to continue or
would you prefer I administer

01:05:34.795 --> 01:05:36.229
drugs now?"

01:05:36.231 --> 01:05:37.664
Not all Germans are Nazi.

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:39.133
I'm not saying she's
a Nazi, I'm saying

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.969
she's in some lovely
clinic where we go into it.

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.470
Yeah, I know you.

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.771
No, but this one I'm not
saying she's not saying

01:05:45.773 --> 01:05:47.706
she's the occupying force.

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:49.543
I'm saying she's in a clinic.

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:51.445
And she's saying, "Do
you want to continue?

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.813
Or would you like to..."

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.046
Don't mention the war.

01:05:54.916 --> 01:05:56.583
I'm not but seriously?

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:59.485
Yeah, she's not, I like a
foreign accent on a woman.

01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:00.920
You like women.

01:06:00.922 --> 01:06:05.593
Mr. Bond, you know, it's
like, you're always...

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:07.927
So, we continue with risotto.

01:06:07.929 --> 01:06:09.229
Thank you.

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:10.229
- One for you.
- Oh, wow.

01:06:10.231 --> 01:06:11.264
Oh, wow.

01:06:11.266 --> 01:06:12.965
Nice and soft for Steve.

01:06:12.967 --> 01:06:14.300
- Thank you.
- And one for you.

01:06:14.302 --> 01:06:15.135
There we are.

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:16.068
Enjoy.

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:26.182
Oh boy, look at that Rob.

01:06:28.717 --> 01:06:29.551
Three sirens.

01:06:30.585 --> 01:06:31.418
Yeah?

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.385
On the rocks.

01:06:32.387 --> 01:06:33.220
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:34.822
Oh, luring me.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.789
They'll just distract themself
to the mass, so you won't

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:39.425
be tempted by that
sort of hussy.

01:06:39.427 --> 01:06:40.760
Hmm, yeah.

01:06:40.762 --> 01:06:41.961
That's what you
needed, isn't it?

01:06:41.963 --> 01:06:43.463
You've needed that in
your life, I think.

01:06:43.465 --> 01:06:45.634
Someone to strap you to the
mast to stop you doing mischief.

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.267
The other sailors
put bungs in their ears

01:06:48.269 --> 01:06:50.637
so they wouldn't
hear the siren song.

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:53.173
He wants to hear it, but he
want to be lured, he wants to

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:57.309
- check out the sirens
- Couldn't be more like you.

01:06:57.311 --> 01:07:00.546
You want you want to
experience up to a point.

01:07:00.548 --> 01:07:03.150
You're a halfway through,
he begs them to untie him

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:06.084
so that he could go
and consummate or

01:07:06.086 --> 01:07:08.320
If I'd strap you to
the mast, I would stick

01:07:08.322 --> 01:07:10.389
with the agreement,
I wouldn't untie you.

01:07:10.391 --> 01:07:12.092
And I'd take some
pleasure in it.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:15.061
I'd have little, I'd have
cotton things in my ears, right?

01:07:15.063 --> 01:07:16.295
You'd be on the mast.

01:07:16.297 --> 01:07:19.164
You go, "Oh Rob, Rob,
I regret my decision.

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:21.434
Please untie me." That
song is fantastic.

01:07:21.436 --> 01:07:22.969
Why would I be a
munchkin with an accent?

01:07:22.971 --> 01:07:24.237
Huh?

01:07:24.239 --> 01:07:25.639
Why would I be, if I
was playing Odysseus?

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:26.840
You're not playing, no,

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.041
I'm not saying you're
playing Odysseus.

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:29.541
I'm saying you are
you and I am me.

01:07:29.543 --> 01:07:30.709
I'd be going, "Let me go."

01:07:30.711 --> 01:07:32.612
And I'd say, "I'm sorry."

01:07:32.614 --> 01:07:35.347
Let me swim to the
sirens, I demand it.

01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:37.883
You have your hands would
be by your side or near,

01:07:37.885 --> 01:07:39.552
you'd be stuck
there, wouldn't you?

01:07:39.554 --> 01:07:40.854
Yeah, Okay.

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:42.588
Let me swim to the sirens.

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:43.558
I'm sorry, Steve.

01:07:44.425 --> 01:07:45.258
I've got...

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.425
I demand it.

01:07:46.427 --> 01:07:48.262
Steve, do you recognise this?

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:51.130
My name is
Odysseus, not Steve.

01:07:51.132 --> 01:07:52.999
Who is this Steve you speak of?

01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:54.967
He's a conceited ass that
I know from Manchester.

01:07:54.969 --> 01:07:58.737
Well, I know not him, but
I have heard of his talent.

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:00.374
I believe he's won seven BAFTAs,

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:01.941
seven BAFTAs?

01:08:01.943 --> 01:08:03.175
Yes.

01:08:03.177 --> 01:08:04.646
What is a BAFTA
that you speak of?

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:13.420
Service.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:16.223
Spartan
women has a reputation

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.290
for being the most beautiful
women in the world.

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:20.859
Yet the men were
gay, go figure.

01:08:20.862 --> 01:08:21.694
Hello.

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:22.627
- Hi
- Hi.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:24.131
So, I have some fish for you.

01:08:25.466 --> 01:08:26.633
Thank you.

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:27.768
And one for you.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.337
- It's grouper
- STEVE: Thank you.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.571
Enjoy it.

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:32.675
Thank you very much.

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:37.846
Much lovely.

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:40.647
Make sure you mop up
a lot of that sauce.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:41.880
Oh yeah.

01:08:41.881 --> 01:08:44.149
After lunch, we'll
go and see the caves.

01:08:44.152 --> 01:08:45.085
Why?

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.252
It's the observers idea.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:48.090
The Greeks, as
I'm sure you know,

01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:50.557
believed that in this area.

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:52.091
Yeah,

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.059
caves were entrances to the
underworld and they thought we

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:58.501
could tie that in and also,
I could mention you as Hades,

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:02.171
plug a few Percy Jackson DVDs.

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.138
Is everything fine?

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.173
- Wonderful.
- Lovely.

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.009
Gorgeous.

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:10.175
Beautiful Bay.

01:09:10.176 --> 01:09:11.143
It's very nice.

01:09:11.145 --> 01:09:13.345
We have tomorrow swim race.

01:09:13.346 --> 01:09:15.081
It's called ocean man.

01:09:15.082 --> 01:09:18.352
They start from the
pier right there.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.184
Can you see it?

01:09:19.185 --> 01:09:20.652
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:09:20.654 --> 01:09:22.854
They will start there and
swim into this direction

01:09:22.856 --> 01:09:25.261
to Neo Itilo to the beach Tsipa.

01:09:26.627 --> 01:09:29.062
It's international, people
all around the world

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.295
- they coming here.
- Wow.

01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:31.798
Maybe you will see it.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.299
I would love to, I would
love to stay for that.

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:34.800
That sounds amazing but..

01:09:34.801 --> 01:09:37.736
we cannot stay, we have
to leave but sounds lovely.

01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:38.770
I'd like to join the race.

01:09:38.773 --> 01:09:40.941
I'd like to join in, I think.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.142
Maybe you can do.

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.310
Yeah, I think so.

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:45.879
No?

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.046
Maybe.

01:09:47.048 --> 01:09:48.549
He's joking with you.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.817
I'm not joke, I'm in
pretty good shape my age.

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:54.720
- We will see.
- We will see.

01:09:54.722 --> 01:09:55.925
Thank you.

01:09:57.525 --> 01:09:59.860
I'd like to do that.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:03.095
Let's join in the race,
joining the... not competitive.

01:10:03.097 --> 01:10:04.030
They just but.

01:10:04.032 --> 01:10:05.731
That's a long way, look at it.

01:10:05.733 --> 01:10:07.232
I have got very good stamina.

01:10:07.234 --> 01:10:09.237
Neither you nor
I could do that.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:12.307
I can certainly, I could
beat you in the race.

01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:17.277
Well, I don't think you
could and we don't have time,

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:19.646
so

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:20.849
Oh, that's convenient.

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.217
Okay, go to the
cave then we'll race.

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:25.084
Great,

01:10:25.086 --> 01:10:26.253
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:10:44.005 --> 01:10:46.839
The Swingle singers
live at Chena gorge.

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:51.009
This is more really suited
to sort of a Gregorian Chant

01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:53.280
to being like a sort
of cathedral sound.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.048
I love Greg.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.715
- What?
- I love Greg.

01:10:56.717 --> 01:10:57.683
Greg who?

01:10:57.685 --> 01:11:00.152
Oh Greg Orian chant, yeah.

01:11:00.154 --> 01:11:02.088
Well, I don't mind
whether Greg or Ian Chant.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.388
I mean, they're both good.

01:11:04.592 --> 01:11:06.058
Would you rather Ian?

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.629
Ian you sit this one
out, Greg is gonna do it.

01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:30.383
You girls, what do you
shout, what do you say go?

01:11:30.385 --> 01:11:33.085
Yeah, say three, two, one go!

01:11:33.087 --> 01:11:34.420
Yeah, sure.

01:11:34.422 --> 01:11:36.356
- Are you ready?
- Don't push me.

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:38.027
Ready, steady, go!

01:12:36.751 --> 01:12:38.884
AlL right, okay, you win,

01:12:38.886 --> 01:12:39.919
I think I switched my shoulder.

01:12:39.921 --> 01:12:41.589
Come on, yes, yes!

01:13:02.176 --> 01:13:03.643
Yeah,

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:04.446
yes,

01:13:06.614 --> 01:13:07.448
Journey.

01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:30.805
Dad?

01:13:34.342 --> 01:13:35.176
Dad?

01:13:41.515 --> 01:13:42.350
Journey.

01:13:47.255 --> 01:13:50.123
I knew your devotion would
prevail over all the rigour

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.461
of the journey and bring
you to your father.

01:13:54.529 --> 01:13:57.198
I might be allowed to look
upon your face my son.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.137
To hear the voice I know so
well, and answer it with my own

01:14:04.104 --> 01:14:07.839
I know how many lands you've
travelled and how many seas

01:14:07.841 --> 01:14:09.510
you've sailed to get to me here.

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:12.114
Give me your hand.

01:14:35.302 --> 01:14:36.137
Steve.

01:14:38.573 --> 01:14:40.505
What are you doing?

01:14:40.507 --> 01:14:41.540
I'm gonna swim.

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:42.777
We are supposed to go.

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:45.547
We are supposed to go.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.581
We gonna be
going near Olympia.

01:14:49.583 --> 01:14:51.349
Why don't we stop there?

01:14:51.351 --> 01:14:53.986
It's gonna be full of
tourists, American tourists

01:14:53.988 --> 01:14:55.754
piling out of coaches.

01:14:55.756 --> 01:14:59.960
The Olympic games were held
every four years throughout

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.561
classical antiquity.

01:15:01.563 --> 01:15:05.097
The site is a major
tourist attraction.

01:15:05.099 --> 01:15:08.401
And has two museums one
devoted to the ancient

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.504
and modern games.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.841
We are not going there,
we're going to Pylos.

01:15:14.274 --> 01:15:15.610
Horrible King Lester.

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:37.599
Greek.

01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:44.169
You're doing like a
horn though, it's a piano.

01:15:46.006 --> 01:15:48.007
Oh, sorry glang is
the word for piano.

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:49.778
glang, glang, glang

01:15:54.048 --> 01:15:55.850
I'll be the Percussion.

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.933
Yeah, I hate that film.

01:16:14.935 --> 01:16:19.272
So posh students from Oxford
learn to run really quickly.

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.108
The end.

01:16:21.842 --> 01:16:22.974
I think there's
a psychological

01:16:22.976 --> 01:16:24.043
disadvantage to sitting

01:16:24.045 --> 01:16:25.614
in the passenger seat in a car.

01:16:26.814 --> 01:16:30.715
The driver automatically
assumes highest status.

01:16:30.717 --> 01:16:35.220
I remember as a child, there
was a chap whose wife drove

01:16:35.222 --> 01:16:36.455
and he didn't.

01:16:36.457 --> 01:16:39.392
And I remember thinking,
that poor guy and to me,

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.695
I thought he was
completely emasculated.

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:44.998
And that woman divorced that
man that he couldn't drive

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.933
and in my head, you know, as
a child, I always thought,

01:16:47.935 --> 01:16:50.602
if he'd learned to drive,
he'd might still be married.

01:16:50.604 --> 01:16:54.374
Yeah, the relationship I
was in before Sally was a long

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:58.210
one, and when it ended,
I was very bereft.

01:16:58.212 --> 01:17:00.379
And I went to stay
with my parents.

01:17:00.381 --> 01:17:02.147
And they said, well, let's
go for a run in the car.

01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:03.650
Okay, yeah.

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:06.152
They drove down to West
Wales but I was sitting

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:07.687
- in the back.
- Oh, dear.

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:10.723
And not only was I now without
my relationship I was also

01:17:10.725 --> 01:17:12.858
a little boy in the back of
the car, at one point near

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.062
Carmarthen I had to say stop
pull over and I made my mom

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.298
get in the back.

01:17:18.765 --> 01:17:20.635
Look at that breathtaking view

01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:24.504
Coastal Pylos presides
over the southern end of

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:25.841
an immense bay.

01:17:30.344 --> 01:17:32.879
Is this the Palace
of King Nestor?

01:17:32.881 --> 01:17:35.417
No, this is an old
Ottoman fortress.

01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:38.920
From the, this day is
from the Ottoman Empire.

01:17:40.387 --> 01:17:43.255
At Ottoman Empire, they have
a great savings on Ottomans

01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:45.258
of all sizes.

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.393
Open bank holiday
Monday, put your feet up

01:17:48.395 --> 01:17:50.097
at Ottoman Empire.

01:17:51.565 --> 01:17:56.570
Otter man, half otter,
half man, new to the Marvel

01:17:57.171 --> 01:17:58.303
comic universe.

01:17:58.305 --> 01:18:00.373
- Half man,
- you could play him.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:03.675
half usable, still
storage facility.

01:18:03.677 --> 01:18:04.611
What's Steve doing?

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:05.878
Oh, he's playing Ottoman.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.045
What?

01:18:07.047 --> 01:18:08.914
Yeah, no, he thinks
he can be good.

01:18:08.916 --> 01:18:11.049
I read the script, it's awful.

01:18:11.051 --> 01:18:13.053
He's gonna do it,
is he all right?

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:13.889
I don't know.

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:18.790
I'm worried about Steve,
he's doing so well.

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:20.594
And then he signed
up for Ottoman.

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:25.432
Tell me more about
Steve Coogan's decision

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:26.632
to play Ottoman.

01:18:26.634 --> 01:18:28.300
Well, this was towards
the end of his life.

01:18:28.302 --> 01:18:29.336
And I think...

01:18:30.838 --> 01:18:34.339
You said that I wanted to
talk more about his talent.

01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:37.375
Well, I mean, talent is a
very subjective thing, isn't it?

01:18:37.377 --> 01:18:38.878
I spent a lot time with him.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.379
We all know that it was
a great talent.

01:18:40.381 --> 01:18:42.714
Why was he so great, so
please, just expound on that.

01:18:42.716 --> 01:18:44.317
Well, that's still
a mystery to me.

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:46.151
I mean, I spent a
lot, I didn't ask...

01:18:46.153 --> 01:18:50.121
That's mystery to you,
what I want to know is

01:18:50.123 --> 01:18:53.092
what can you encapsulate
in a sentence,

01:18:53.094 --> 01:18:55.760
the genius of Steve Coogan.

01:18:55.762 --> 01:18:59.067
I met a lot of people over
the years who didn't like him.

01:19:00.234 --> 01:19:01.967
We don't have that
much time left.

01:19:01.969 --> 01:19:03.736
- No.
- You're gonna miss me?

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:07.005
Well, yes and no.

01:19:07.007 --> 01:19:10.009
Yes and no? Bloody hell

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:13.946
And you're very entertaining
but you can be exhausting.

01:19:13.948 --> 01:19:16.248
Exhausting, me?

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.386
Good God, you should meet you.

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:22.724
I have met me and we got
on like a house on fire.

01:19:25.859 --> 01:19:29.128
That was the same, it
looked like, it looks like

01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:34.136
a halls of residence in a
1960s British University.

01:19:35.603 --> 01:19:36.936
Well, no yeah what's wrong
with that, that's modernism.

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.970
It's is utopia modernism
and that is incredible.

01:19:38.972 --> 01:19:40.876
That's, that's 1200 BC.

01:19:43.511 --> 01:19:45.643
Plus 800 years
before the Parthenon.

01:19:45.645 --> 01:19:48.213
On grand designs, imagine
Kevin MacLeod going back to..

01:19:48.215 --> 01:19:50.049
Yeah, and that's
why it's amazing.

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:52.017
see, they're happy with
their underfloor heating.

01:19:52.019 --> 01:19:54.521
We are beginning to feel pinch
Kevin but we do want to see

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:59.258
it too, because, you know,
it's our dream house.

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:00.626
It's the same amount
of time between that

01:20:00.628 --> 01:20:02.260
and the Parthenon is
between ups and the building

01:20:02.262 --> 01:20:03.798
of Canterbury Cathedral.

01:20:05.065 --> 01:20:06.464
And as the sun sprang up,

01:20:06.466 --> 01:20:08.468
Oh you look very good there.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.335
Leaving the brilliant
water in its wake.

01:20:10.337 --> 01:20:11.836
You look like
you've come to inspect

01:20:11.838 --> 01:20:13.973
for building regulations

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:17.477
Time the bronze dawn to
show light onto immortal gods

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.512
and mortal men.

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:23.650
The ship sailed into Pylos,
where people lined the beaches,

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:27.085
sacrificing sleek,
black bulls to Poseidon

01:20:35.296 --> 01:20:38.664
Driving quite fast
for a narrow road.

01:20:38.666 --> 01:20:40.302
You don't mind me saying.

01:20:41.168 --> 01:20:42.669
Thank you.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:43.471
That's shortcut.

01:20:44.471 --> 01:20:45.506
That's not the road.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:47.775
This is the road.

01:20:51.645 --> 01:20:52.778
Are you allowed to do this?

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:53.547
Am I allowed?

01:20:54.614 --> 01:20:55.716
I was born allowed mate.

01:21:04.391 --> 01:21:06.023
It's up here, isn't it?

01:21:06.025 --> 01:21:07.559
been a ridge here.

01:21:07.561 --> 01:21:08.861
Wow, good lord.

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:13.835
Without the, to
historic

01:21:30.083 --> 01:21:31.019
This is it,

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:36.091
this is, where, King Nestor
had a huge feast to Telemachus.

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:38.691
Two and a half
thousand years ago.

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:41.126
So, what they call it ox-belly
Bay 'cause of all the bulls

01:21:41.128 --> 01:21:42.393
they sacrificed?

01:21:42.395 --> 01:21:44.196
No, cause it's the
shape of an ox's belly.

01:21:44.198 --> 01:21:45.496
Yeah, I know.

01:21:45.498 --> 01:21:47.165
Right, we've seen it Let's go

01:21:47.167 --> 01:21:49.069
See the mouth of the Bay
there, I can I could swim that.

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.004
I can swim that, it's
hardy the Hellespont, is it?

01:21:53.006 --> 01:21:55.641
It's not even Assos to Lesbos.

01:21:55.643 --> 01:21:58.777
I'll race you, my
shoulder's better now.

01:21:58.779 --> 01:21:59.611
Come on, seriously let's go.

01:21:59.613 --> 01:22:00.711
Come on.

01:22:00.713 --> 01:22:04.219
All right.

01:22:06.386 --> 01:22:07.820
Hello.

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:09.187
Hello, Joe.

01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:10.090
Hey, dad.

01:22:12.059 --> 01:22:14.296
Hey.

01:22:15.695 --> 01:22:16.797
It's granddad.

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:19.734
Yeah, what about him?

01:22:22.136 --> 01:22:23.170
I'm really sorry.

01:22:26.173 --> 01:22:27.005
What?

01:22:27.007 --> 01:22:28.042
I'm really sorry,

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:33.280
he's died.

01:22:37.484 --> 01:22:38.652
I'm sorry dad.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:46.394
Are you okay?

01:22:49.463 --> 01:22:52.165
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:53.001
Are you okay?

01:22:54.467 --> 01:22:55.302
Yeah.

01:23:00.173 --> 01:23:02.176
I'll come straight home.

01:23:03.043 --> 01:23:04.546
Yeah, okay.

01:23:08.582 --> 01:23:11.717
All right, I'll see you soon.

01:23:11.719 --> 01:23:13.751
Yeah, see you soon.

01:23:13.753 --> 01:23:14.586
Love you.

01:23:14.588 --> 01:23:15.422
Love you too, bye.

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:39.210
Hey, Steve.

01:23:39.212 --> 01:23:40.047
Hi Emma.

01:23:40.948 --> 01:23:43.249
I'm so sorry about your dad.

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:44.316
Who told you.

01:23:44.318 --> 01:23:46.218
Joe called me.

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.486
Listen, I've checked all flights

01:23:47.488 --> 01:23:49.522
and the best way home,
is to get on the ferry

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:53.692
with Rob to Ithaca, it
stops at Sami in Kefalonia

01:23:53.694 --> 01:23:56.797
and then you can go direct
flight to Manchester, okay?

01:23:57.631 --> 01:23:59.130
Okay, great.

01:23:59.132 --> 01:24:00.432
Joe said that he's
staying at Catharine's

01:24:00.434 --> 01:24:02.101
and you'd stay there.

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:03.402
Is that okay?

01:24:03.404 --> 01:24:04.903
Would you rather I
book you a hotel?

01:24:04.905 --> 01:24:07.673
Yes, if that's what Joe
wants, I'll go straight there.

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:09.174
All right, okay.

01:24:09.176 --> 01:24:11.677
Listen, sending
lots of love, okay?

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:13.213
Okay, bye bye.

01:24:24.057 --> 01:24:24.926
What's going on?

01:24:27.628 --> 01:24:28.462
My dad's died.

01:24:31.698 --> 01:24:32.500
What?

01:24:33.634 --> 01:24:36.404
Yeah, so, I've
got to fly home.

01:24:42.842 --> 01:24:43.677
I'm sorry.

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:46.044
I'll drive.

01:24:46.046 --> 01:24:49.049
No, I want to drive,
I wanna keep busy.

01:24:53.753 --> 01:24:55.155
All these butterflies.

01:27:12.091 --> 01:27:12.926
Sami.

01:27:14.795 --> 01:27:17.065
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:27:21.268 --> 01:27:22.770
And that's Ithaca.

01:27:25.672 --> 01:27:27.839
Let's come back another day.

01:27:27.841 --> 01:27:29.676
Yeah, we will.

01:27:35.315 --> 01:27:37.551
I'm gonna go get my bags.

01:27:44.057 --> 01:27:45.691
I'll give you a call.

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.525
Be strong, yeah?

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:48.262
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

01:28:50.256 --> 01:28:51.259
That's me.

01:28:52.225 --> 01:28:53.894
I'm coming aboard.

01:28:57.096 --> 01:28:59.300
I don't love your mother.

01:29:10.677 --> 01:29:12.710
I'm going to the airport.

01:29:12.712 --> 01:29:13.544
Yes, sir.

01:29:13.546 --> 01:29:14.780
How long does it take?

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:16.551
45
minutes approximately.

01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:24.092
It's a bit windy.

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:26.927
And you're blown away.

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:31.099
Oh, wow.

01:29:33.266 --> 01:29:35.400
Oh god.

01:29:35.402 --> 01:29:39.239
How do you think?

01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:41.706
I've missed you.

01:29:41.708 --> 01:29:43.040
I've missed you
too, oh my goddess.

01:29:43.042 --> 01:29:44.177
Very nice to see.

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:53.751
So, how have you been?

01:29:53.753 --> 01:29:57.123
Oh, it's been a bloody long
journey, I'll tell you that.

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.423
An Odyssey.

01:29:58.425 --> 01:30:00.395
I didn't know
Greece was so big.

01:30:01.293 --> 01:30:03.131
It's over now, you're home.

01:30:30.457 --> 01:30:32.257
It's good driving a car.

01:30:32.259 --> 01:30:33.424
Don't you normally?

01:30:33.426 --> 01:30:34.728
No, I do not.

01:30:35.628 --> 01:30:36.861
He doesn't let you.

01:30:36.863 --> 01:30:38.796
It's not a question
of letting me drive.

01:30:38.798 --> 01:30:40.065
He likes to drive,

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:41.232
Its nice to be in
the driver's seat

01:30:41.234 --> 01:30:43.603
I let him drive.

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.338
Fair enough.

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:51.043
I like to drive, I
like to be in control.

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:53.547
You got your hands at
10 to two that's good.

01:30:55.015 --> 01:30:58.219
But, no, you can follow
the line, the racing line.

01:30:59.386 --> 01:31:02.089
You brake into the
bend, accelerate out.

01:31:03.356 --> 01:31:05.357
You're glad I'm here,
'cause you get to drive.

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.290
Yeah, 'cause I'm the boss.

01:31:07.761 --> 01:31:11.065
I am glad you're here
for a multitude of reasons.

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:14.799
It's strange to
be without the kids.

01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:16.768
Welcome to my world,
is not you know.

01:31:16.770 --> 01:31:18.670
You had a hard time.

01:31:18.672 --> 01:31:20.972
It is hard, you
miss the kids, yes,.

01:31:20.974 --> 01:31:23.509
I don't apologise for that.

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:24.875
No fun and games.

01:31:24.877 --> 01:31:28.282
No, it's mostly fun and games.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:36.757
Poor Steve, its
awful to lose your dad.

01:31:47.067 --> 01:31:49.101
Amazing, natural bay.

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:51.436
See why Odysseus wanted
to get home, can't you?

01:31:51.438 --> 01:31:52.903
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

01:31:52.905 --> 01:31:56.674
We should come back
here when I'm in my 70s.

01:31:56.676 --> 01:31:59.544
And I'm in my 60s?

01:31:59.546 --> 01:32:02.348
I think in all likelihood
and please don't take this

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.548
the wrong way.

01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:05.416
I do think by then I'll
have married again,

01:32:05.418 --> 01:32:06.751
I live down the road.

01:32:06.753 --> 01:32:08.253
Yeah.

01:32:08.255 --> 01:32:11.623
And I'll be with a pilates
instructor in her mid...

01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:12.458
Very live.

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:13.458
Oh very live, yes

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.293
- Very flexible.
- Very bendy.

01:32:15.295 --> 01:32:18.229
A broad minded and now
you'll have my money.

01:32:18.231 --> 01:32:19.796
- Good.
- So it's not all...

01:32:19.798 --> 01:32:20.732
It's not all doom and gloom.

01:32:20.734 --> 01:32:21.602
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:32:22.802 --> 01:32:24.503
You'll have a nice
place down in Toquay.

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:25.836
Or here.

01:32:25.838 --> 01:32:27.138
We're no not if I'm coming.

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:28.139
I wouldn't come here if
you were here, would I?

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:32.446
I'd want to come
just me and Consuela.

01:32:41.221 --> 01:32:43.088
Hi darling.

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.055
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:32:45.057 --> 01:32:47.558
How are you?

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.093
Good, how are you?

01:32:49.095 --> 01:32:50.396
Yeah, we're good.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:51.763
- Hi, Chloe.
- Yeah, we're both here.

01:32:51.765 --> 01:32:54.001
Mommy's here, she's arrived.

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:18.757
Yes, Penelope how
wonderful to see you again.

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:23.628
Gosh gotta get in a marital
bed after all these years.

01:33:23.630 --> 01:33:25.733
Penelope is not a
very sexy name, is it?

01:33:26.833 --> 01:33:29.836
Then I should call
you Penny, Money Penny.

01:33:32.105 --> 01:33:33.839
Is Sally a sexy name?

01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:37.008
I'd say so, I like
Sally's very sexy.

01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:38.509
I'm sure she's sexy actually.

01:33:38.511 --> 01:33:40.614
Very, very sexy, sexy Sally.

01:33:46.153 --> 01:33:47.154
Thank you.

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:49.920
Very difficult to
share your information.

01:33:49.922 --> 01:33:51.423
Your information?

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:53.724
No, I'm from Edinburgh, or
you shared your information.

01:33:53.726 --> 01:33:55.192
No, I'm from
Edinburgh, all right.

01:33:55.194 --> 01:33:56.760
- I can see...
- Please stop talking.

01:33:56.762 --> 01:33:58.296
It's time to begin, right?

01:33:58.298 --> 01:33:59.597
All goodness me.

01:33:59.599 --> 01:34:01.132
I wonder what I left my phone.

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:04.902
When I make love, I make
love for queen and country.

01:34:04.904 --> 01:34:09.175
You know I admit, making love
to you, would be, pleasure.

01:34:34.268 --> 01:34:35.101
Hey.

01:34:39.271 --> 01:34:40.505
Are you all right?

01:34:40.507 --> 01:34:41.841
Yeah, are you?

01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:44.345
Yeah.

01:34:48.314 --> 01:34:49.549
I'll take that.

01:34:50.583 --> 01:34:51.516
You got here quick.

01:34:51.518 --> 01:34:52.983
Yeah.

01:34:52.985 --> 01:34:54.686
Do you need a cup
of tea or anything?

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:55.690
Yeah, thanks.

01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:59.724
Mum says, you can
have the spare room.

01:34:59.726 --> 01:35:00.594
Great, good.

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:03.297
I'm sorry, I wasn't here.

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:05.833
That's okay.

01:35:08.835 --> 01:35:11.172
Were you with him?

01:35:13.172 --> 01:35:14.007
Yeah.

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:05.349
Hello Steve.

01:37:05.351 --> 01:37:06.353
Oh, hello.

01:37:09.922 --> 01:37:12.123
Sorry to hear about your dad.

01:37:12.125 --> 01:37:13.127
Thank you.

01:37:14.426 --> 01:37:16.764
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:21.732
It's strange being back
here after all these years.

01:37:21.734 --> 01:37:23.403
Yeah, I bet it is.

01:37:24.636 --> 01:37:27.875
- How are you?
- I'm good, yeah, I'm good.

01:37:29.842 --> 01:37:31.343
Thank you.

01:37:31.345 --> 01:37:36.250
Hey, it's time to go see
granddad, at the undertakers

01:37:37.417 --> 01:37:40.251
Do you want me
to come with you?

01:37:40.253 --> 01:37:42.653
No, I'll be fine.

01:37:42.655 --> 01:37:46.290
You'll stay here till
the funeral, won't you?

01:37:46.292 --> 01:37:47.795
Well, thank you.

01:38:17.957 --> 01:38:20.126
Quite jagged on your feet.

01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:40.477
He wept, as he held
the wife he loved,

01:38:40.479 --> 01:38:44.183
sole discretion in
his arms at last.

01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:48.586
Joy, warm is the joy

01:38:48.588 --> 01:38:52.926
felt by shipwrecked
sailors, as they sight land.

01:38:54.627 --> 01:38:58.896
Joyous too for her, the
sight of her husband,

01:38:58.898 --> 01:39:01.632
vivid in her gaze.

01:39:01.634 --> 01:39:06.573
So, wide arms, embracing his
neck, would never let him go.

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:13.113
I'm doing Anthony Hopkins.

01:39:14.314 --> 01:39:19.320
I know.

01:39:21.587 --> 01:39:22.755
I do love you.

01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:25.259
You know that.
