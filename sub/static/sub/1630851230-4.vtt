- Quick, ask me a question
about ad content on Zoom.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.835

child protection filters?

- Will do.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.649

in West Windsor, New Jersey,

03:21.810 --> 03:24.291
Carrie Chen was leaving
an early dinner with friends

03:24.334 --> 03:27.076
when she was abducted
outside a restaurant

03:27.119 --> 03:28.425
and taken in a cargo van.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.601
Her friend and a man
who tried to help her

03:30.645 --> 03:32.255
were both shot dead.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.648
The assailant was a white male

03:33.691 --> 03:35.954
and all the victims
were Asian American.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.956
- According to witnesses,
her abductor yelled,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.394
"All you people,
go back to your own country,"

03:40.437 --> 03:41.525
or words to that effect.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.092
- Well, it sounds like
a hate crime.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.050
- Carrie's husband
is a well-known professor

03:45.094 --> 03:46.530
and researcher at Princeton,

03:46.574 --> 03:49.446
making this
a high-profile case.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.970
The Jersey Field Office
has asked for our assist.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.103
- Cameras turn anything up
on the van?

03:54.146 --> 03:56.279
- Witnesses place it
traveling south,

03:56.323 --> 03:59.848
and our unsub appears
to be working alone.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.023
- Carrie and her husband
have been married

04:01.066 --> 04:03.634
a little over three years.

04:05.506 --> 04:08.900
- He's on his way back from an
academic conference in Boston.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.990
Officers are meeting him at the
airport and they will notify us

04:12.034 --> 04:13.905
as soon as he lands.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.211
We can't rule him out.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.647
- Neither have
criminal histories.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.345
They both have
regular salaries.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.564
- No ransom demands yet.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.566
- And no body.
- Yet.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.613
- So you think
this attack was random?

04:25.656 --> 04:27.528
- Mm, it's a possibility.
One of the victims

04:27.571 --> 04:30.052
had no connection to Carrie
or her friends.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.185
Just a Good Samaritan
walking down the street.

04:33.229 --> 04:35.449
- But our unsub was willing
to kill to grab Carrie,

04:35.492 --> 04:37.625
so he could have been
following her.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.714
Maybe a fixation on her.
- I don't know.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.933
Hate crimes can escalate
pretty fast.

04:41.977 --> 04:45.720
A perceived side-eye can erupt
into a lynching mob.

04:45.763 --> 04:48.331
- First fight I had started
with someone calling me a name

04:48.375 --> 04:50.290
that my father had
to explain to me.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.683
I didn't even know the guy.
- Point taken.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.468
You and I will head up
to Hate Crimes Division.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.253
Barnes, Kristin,
take Carrie's workplace.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.777
We are looking for the connect,
if there is any,

04:59.821 --> 05:01.866
between Carrie
and her abductor.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.524
- I almost didn't hire Carrie.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.657
We upload premium content
for children,

05:09.700 --> 05:13.008
and her online presence is
inconsistent with our mission.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.836
- What do you mean?
She writes mostly

05:14.879 --> 05:17.273
about restaurant openings
and what she ate there.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.101
- Ah, that's because
we scrubbed

05:19.144 --> 05:21.843
her most recent history,
everything that denigrated

05:21.886 --> 05:23.410
China's overhauling
of Hong Kong.

05:23.453 --> 05:24.585
- Overhauling?

05:24.628 --> 05:26.021
I've heard it called
a takeover.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.936
- That's one of the words
Carrie used.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.939
She was born in Hong Kong.

05:30.982 --> 05:33.637
The shutdown of the protests
spun her into overdrive.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.900
The changes
in their school curriculum,

05:35.944 --> 05:37.206
the firing of civil servants--

05:37.249 --> 05:39.164
- And she posted about it all?
- Yes.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.819
She was very passionate.
And we can't have that here.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.387
Our company partners
with China.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.128
- Well, how can you be sure
she's still not posting?

05:46.171 --> 05:48.696
Maybe under an alias.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.785
- I can manage my employees.

05:50.828 --> 05:54.005
- So you monitor their emails,
right, their personal emails?

05:54.049 --> 05:55.659
So if her posts
were inflammatory,

05:55.703 --> 05:58.749
were there any death threats
made against her?

05:58.793 --> 06:01.273
- She did receive a fair amount
of hate mail.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.840
Much of it in Mandarin.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.625
- She had a lot of enemies,
then?

06:04.668 --> 06:06.540
- A whole country.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.849
- How often do victims of hate
crimes know their attackers?

06:11.893 --> 06:14.330
- The pattern we're seeing
in anti-Asian incidents

06:14.374 --> 06:15.940
is that the more
violent the crime,

06:15.984 --> 06:18.421
the more likely the victim
doesn't know the offender.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.902
Just this week,
a 94-year-old woman was stabbed

06:20.945 --> 06:23.644
outside an H Mart
by some rando in the street

06:23.687 --> 06:25.602
blaming her
for the "China virus."

06:25.646 --> 06:27.430
- I've heard it called
a lot of things.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.345
- Since COVID,
we've seen a big increase

06:29.389 --> 06:31.869
in crimes against
Asian Americans.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.610
And we only catch
the violent cases.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.961
We have no way of documenting
the countless microaggressions,

06:37.005 --> 06:41.357
the drive-by "ching chong"
and nail salon jokes.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.315
These are all the informants,
known actors,

06:43.359 --> 06:45.622
and parolees connected to
or suspected

06:45.666 --> 06:47.755
of anti-Asian hate crimes
in this area.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.366
- Any abductions prior
to Carrie's?

06:52.368 --> 06:53.978
- Completely honest here...

06:54.022 --> 06:56.590
Carrie Chen's kidnapping is one
of the worst-case scenarios

06:56.633 --> 06:59.810
we thought could happen and
hoped like hell it wouldn't.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.986
- Go through these with Barnes.

07:02.030 --> 07:05.555
Carrie's husband just landed.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.122
Thank you, Arya.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.690
- My, uh, first flight was
canceled because the--

07:09.733 --> 07:11.343
the crew never showed up.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.476
- Try to calm down if you can,
Mr. Beck.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.478
- We all want
to find your wife.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.611
- I can't believe
this is happening.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.310
- Anything unusual happen
over the last few weeks?

07:21.353 --> 07:23.965
Aggression towards you
or your wife?

07:24.008 --> 07:28.230
- Yeah, yeah, sure,
but that's not unusual.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.710
Look, I'm a white man
in a white neighborhood

07:29.753 --> 07:31.625

I mean--

07:31.668 --> 07:34.410

07:34.454 --> 07:35.542
well, I'll leave it
to your imagination

07:35.585 --> 07:37.935
what we were called.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.807

07:39.850 --> 07:40.982
- Yeah, she's been spit on,

07:41.025 --> 07:43.680
she's been locked
out of stores, but...

07:43.724 --> 07:45.334

I was--I was at a meeting.

07:52.428 --> 07:55.431
- And the meeting, what was it
about, who was it with?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.564
- Uh, Brice Lonner.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.957
Uh, he runs R&D at ParGen.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.525
- You're meeting
at their headquarters?

08:02.569 --> 08:04.353
ParGen's one of the biggest
pharmaceuticals out there.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.747
- Well, they have
a small office in the city.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.705
I didn't want to go to Boston.

08:08.749 --> 08:09.837
My brother lives there,

08:09.880 --> 08:12.187
so I was
spending the night with him.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.754
- And the meeting,
what was it about?

08:13.797 --> 08:15.538
- What does this have to do
with my wife missing?

08:15.582 --> 08:16.713

some of the studies in my labs,

08:22.458 --> 08:24.634

08:26.114 --> 08:28.333

That was the plan.

I can't be away

08:33.295 --> 08:35.036

to some time away?

08:35.079 --> 08:38.430

she just started a new job.

- No more ransom demands,
but I doubt we'll get one

22:00.231 --> 22:02.930
if Stephen's working
for the Chinese government.

22:02.973 --> 22:04.932
- I'm stuck
on something though.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.368
Why lure Stephen to the park?

22:06.412 --> 22:08.239
- When he was abducted
from his home anyway.

22:08.283 --> 22:09.763
I'm with you.

22:09.806 --> 22:10.938
- It doesn't add up.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.026
- Okay,
so we've been to his home.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.506
We've been to his lab.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.377
We haven't talked to whoever
he had his meeting with

22:15.421 --> 22:16.944
the day his wife was taken.

22:16.987 --> 22:18.249
- His name's Brice Lonner.

22:18.293 --> 22:21.252
ParGen has deep pockets,
endless resources.

22:21.296 --> 22:23.080
- They'd have to want
Stephen's technology

22:23.124 --> 22:24.430
bad enough to kidnap him.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.214
- Someone obviously does.

22:31.915 --> 22:34.396
ERT got an ID
on Stephen's abductor.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.051
Trace amounts of blood
were left on the broken lamp.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.835
- He must've fought back.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.058
- Rodney Harlock, 29.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.103

fits the description

22:46.147 --> 22:47.409

22:47.453 --> 22:49.150
- This could be our unsub.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.326
- No history of employment.
He's been in and out of jail

22:51.370 --> 22:52.849
for theft and carjacking.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.373
- Lucky he's in the system
at all.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.157
Kristin, you're on ParGen.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.985

company's gonna come clean

22:58.028 --> 23:00.596

involving a potential asset?

23:00.640 --> 23:04.383
- You never know.
You're a very charming person.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.036

23:27.275 --> 23:29.495

23:33.760 --> 23:35.849
I'll get this sent over

23:35.892 --> 23:37.416

a digital trail

23:37.459 --> 23:39.461
that leads us back
to the Chinese.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.376
Maybe he's a gun for hire.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.074
All right, we got cargo shorts,

23:44.118 --> 23:46.555

23:46.599 --> 23:48.383
and a back brace.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.038

- Thought he wasn't working.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.735
- Well,
maybe he gets paid in cash.

23:52.779 --> 23:53.997
- Maybe.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.912
Either way--
- Doesn't look like the kind

23:55.956 --> 23:58.393
of person China would hire
to kidnap a scientist.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.265
- No.
Not at all.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.356
- Thank you.
- Of course.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.055
It's awful what's going on.

24:08.098 --> 24:11.275
I'm sorry for Stephen--
and his wife too.

24:11.319 --> 24:14.148
- He said he was meeting
with you about a lab grant.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.715
- That was part of it, sure.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.717
It's how we got him
on a plane to Boston,

24:17.760 --> 24:20.241
but we've been courting him
for lots of reasons.

24:20.284 --> 24:23.592
- Such as his CRISPR research?
Is that what you're after?

24:23.636 --> 24:24.767
- Stephen turned us down,

24:24.811 --> 24:26.552
along with every
other Big Pharma.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.162
He thinks it's a conflict
of interest

24:28.205 --> 24:29.598
and we should stay out
of academia.

24:29.642 --> 24:32.209
Said his brain isn't for sale,
neither is his work.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.341
- So you'll move on
to someone else?

24:33.384 --> 24:34.864
- No, no,
there's no one like Stephen.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.214
We were hoping to mass market
his cure for thalassemia.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.782
- But his research depends on a
patient's blood being scrubbed

24:39.826 --> 24:43.525
and put back into their bodies,
so how do you mass market that?

24:43.569 --> 24:46.180
- Well, we believe it can
be used for other purposes,

24:46.223 --> 24:47.616
blood thinners, for example.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.226
- But his clinical trial
is for a congenital disease.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.141
- Our goal is to eradicate
that disease.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.883
- And how far are you willing
to go for that?

24:56.799 --> 24:59.541
- Do you have kids, Ms. Gaines?
- Two.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.021
- And I'm sure
you'd do everything possible

25:01.064 --> 25:03.240
to keep them safe and healthy?

25:03.284 --> 25:05.591
So what if you could start
at the beginning,

25:05.634 --> 25:06.853
before they're even born,

25:06.896 --> 25:10.117
and eliminate the chance
of certain diseases?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.989
- Well, embryonic gene splicing
is illegal in this country.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.122
- It is now,
but laws change all the time.

25:15.165 --> 25:16.950
- Yeah,
especially when you have

25:16.993 --> 25:18.821
powerful lobbyists
on your side.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.827
- This research is currently
happening in mice and rats.

25:24.871 --> 25:29.440
What we do there will help keep
our children safe and healthy.

25:29.484 --> 25:32.618
That's all ParGen wants to do.

25:32.661 --> 25:36.099
- That and make billions
of dollars in the process.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.277
This is America.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.801
- Yeah.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.934
ParGen could easily be behind
Stephen's abduction.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.806
- I don't buy it.
It sounds too Hollywood.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.939
- Rodney Harlock is a good
person to hire as a middleman.

25:49.983 --> 25:52.289
It's hard to connect the dots
between the two.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.161
- Same is true
if Stephen's a spy, right?

25:54.204 --> 25:57.947
CCP could have hired Harlock to
abduct both Stephen and Carrie.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.601
- Well, who's to say
ParGen isn't working

25:59.645 --> 26:02.169
with or for the Chinese?

26:02.212 --> 26:04.824
- So what are we missing here?
Do we have this backwards?

26:04.867 --> 26:07.348
Is Carrie the intended target
after all?

26:07.391 --> 26:09.655
- She did speak up against the
Chinese takeover of Hong Kong.

26:09.698 --> 26:12.788
- On Instagram,
not in "The New York Times."

26:12.832 --> 26:15.922
- We looked into her family,
came up with nothing.
