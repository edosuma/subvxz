WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:04.812
Showed up on a run I don't
really need help on. How come?

00:04.814 --> 00:06.063
Just didn't think
it was smart

00:06.065 --> 00:07.414
for you to be
out here on your own.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.093
Morgan. What are
you smiling about?

00:11.170 --> 00:13.070
- No reason.
- Every time I cough,

00:13.072 --> 00:15.130
every time I lose my breath,
I wonder

00:15.207 --> 00:16.873
if this is the beginning
of the end for me.

00:16.951 --> 00:18.375
And we brokered
a deal with Logan

00:18.453 --> 00:20.394
to help us expand
what we've already built.

00:20.471 --> 00:22.621
You help us
keep this place going,

00:22.623 --> 00:25.090
there's no telling
what we can offer each other.

00:25.168 --> 00:26.234
I can stay.

00:26.310 --> 00:27.460
I'll help you make it.
I know how.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.070
We can
keep you alive.

00:29.146 --> 00:31.322
Now that sounds like
a deal to me.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.910
<i>What was her name?</i>

00:37.321 --> 00:39.563
<i>Her name was Jenny.</i>

00:39.565 --> 00:41.916
<i>Where was she from?</i>

00:41.918 --> 00:45.068
<i>North Carolina,
originally.</i>

00:45.070 --> 00:47.329
<i>We had met in Raleigh.</i>

00:47.331 --> 00:50.574
<i>What do you want
to tell me about her?</i>

00:53.930 --> 00:55.972
<i>How much tape you got?</i>

00:57.325 --> 00:59.100
<i>She hated the water.</i>

00:59.102 --> 01:02.103
<i>You know, she... she hated it.</i>

01:03.589 --> 01:05.254
<i>But she still
didn't have the heart</i>

01:05.257 --> 01:06.941
<i>to tell me I'd wasted
half a paycheck</i>

01:06.943 --> 01:09.685
<i>rentin' that damn boat
for our date.</i>

01:09.687 --> 01:15.841
<i>Her family was there,
and, uh, my brother.</i>

01:15.843 --> 01:20.863
<i>It was just a small ceremony,
you know,</i>

01:20.865 --> 01:24.517
<i>and that was alright with us.</i>

01:24.519 --> 01:31.190
<i>I didn't sleep...
I mean, really sleep...</i>

01:31.192 --> 01:34.209
<i>good three months.</i>

01:34.211 --> 01:37.179
<i>He wanted to get a dog.</i>

01:37.181 --> 01:41.550
<i>Yeah, he, um...
he played baseball,</i>

01:41.552 --> 01:43.978
<i>and he was terrible.</i>

01:45.998 --> 01:50.651
<i>Boy just... just loved comics.</i>

01:52.730 --> 01:57.716
<i>He made me this card</i>

01:57.718 --> 01:59.994
<i>for Father's Day.</i>

02:03.291 --> 02:06.892
<i>My boy, Duane...</i>

02:06.894 --> 02:11.005
<i>he was the best of both of us.</i>

02:15.011 --> 02:16.902
<i>You know, you grow up,</i>

02:16.904 --> 02:22.666
<i>and you think
that you know what life is,</i>

02:22.668 --> 02:26.261
<i>that you...
you seen the patterns.</i>

02:27.673 --> 02:31.934
<i>And the clichés
are pretty much true.</i>

02:31.936 --> 02:34.103
<i>And then you have a child,</i>

02:34.105 --> 02:38.181
<i>and it reframes everything
that everybody knows.</i>

02:38.183 --> 02:40.684
Morgan,
we're all gassed up.

02:40.686 --> 02:42.203
I was just...

02:42.205 --> 02:43.704
you know,
I was just watchin'.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.539
Nice.

02:47.769 --> 02:49.769
We should get back
to the convoy.

02:49.771 --> 02:51.879
Been outta range
for a couple of days.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.622
Still got some boxes
to drop off, though,

02:53.624 --> 02:54.882
don't we?

02:54.884 --> 02:57.385
We haven't been
this far west before.

02:57.387 --> 02:59.286
We're runnin' low
on gas.

02:59.288 --> 03:01.947
How low?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.623
About a day's worth?

03:03.625 --> 03:06.060
We should drop off
some more boxes, though.

03:06.062 --> 03:08.454
You know, they could make
a difference for somebody.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.747
I don't know.
We should get back.

03:09.749 --> 03:12.975
Boxes make
a difference, Al. We...

03:12.977 --> 03:14.694
Alright.

03:36.834 --> 03:38.634
Shit.

03:41.338 --> 03:42.746
What?

03:42.748 --> 03:44.840
There were
three cans of gas.

04:02.768 --> 04:05.286
Battery's probably dead.

04:06.772 --> 04:08.681
Hey.

04:10.418 --> 04:13.035
Look, even if you got
some of that gas in there,

04:13.037 --> 04:14.319
it's not
gonna start.

04:14.321 --> 04:15.537
- Back away.
- It's alright.

04:15.539 --> 04:17.873
We just need
the gas back.

04:17.875 --> 04:19.358
- "We"?
- Easy there.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.801
I said back away.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.118
No,
she's right.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.696
We do need it.
So listen.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.288
Why don't we
talk about it?

04:25.290 --> 04:26.640
Just get the hell
away from me.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.896
Hey, need you
to lower the knife.

04:33.557 --> 04:35.816
Come on.

04:35.818 --> 04:37.276
Lower the knife.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.481
Now, why don't you tell us
where you're trying to get.

04:53.911 --> 04:55.318
Morgan.

04:56.655 --> 04:59.248
No. No.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.008
They found me.

05:05.089 --> 05:07.406
Get in the van.
Al.

05:15.191 --> 05:17.933
Shh-shh-shh.

05:43.219 --> 05:45.869
Al.

05:45.871 --> 05:47.388
Four?

05:53.971 --> 05:56.880
- Shit.
- What?

05:56.882 --> 05:59.474
- Uh, gas cap.
- Al.

06:45.430 --> 06:48.132
Over here!

06:48.134 --> 06:50.600
He went this way!

07:00.855 --> 07:02.496
Okay,
start talking.

07:04.449 --> 07:05.633
Who the hell
was that?

07:05.635 --> 07:07.776
It's alright.

07:07.778 --> 07:09.470
We can help you.

07:12.716 --> 07:15.550
That's what they said.

<i>Destiny guides our fortunes more
favorably than we could've expected.</i>

07:36.165 --> 07:38.648
<i>Look there, Sancho Panza,
my friend,</i>

07:38.650 --> 07:40.909
<i>and see those 30 or so
wild giants</i>

07:40.911 --> 07:44.396

07:59.872 --> 08:01.021
Hey.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.931
What are you
listening to?

08:02.933 --> 08:05.508
"Don Quixote"...
Cervantes.

08:05.510 --> 08:07.343
Ah. Beautiful.

08:07.345 --> 08:08.937
Long-winded.

08:08.939 --> 08:10.339
Yeah.

08:10.341 --> 08:12.700
Anything we can salvage
from the stores?

08:12.702 --> 08:15.018
Nothing so far,
but even if we did,

08:15.020 --> 08:16.704
we're running out of room
in this truck.

08:16.706 --> 08:19.281
- We could make room.
- Why don't you take a break?

08:19.283 --> 08:20.666
I saw
a case of Fanta.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.950
Grape or orange?

08:23.361 --> 08:24.712
It's an
important distinction.

08:24.714 --> 08:27.047
Whichever one gets you
off the roof faster.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.609
Well, convoy's gonna need
solar panels

08:30.611 --> 08:32.626
for when we find a place
to settle down.

08:32.629 --> 08:35.280
Nothin' wrong in stockpiling
for the future, right?

08:35.282 --> 08:37.725
No,
there isn't.

08:37.727 --> 08:41.787
But I wanna go to the
record shop and see what I find.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.899
You're talking
about the future.

08:45.901 --> 08:49.644
Nice to hear you
looking in that direction.

08:50.981 --> 08:52.239
It's orange,
by the way.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.633
Ah, I was hopin'
for grape.

08:55.986 --> 08:58.228
Hey, hey, come on.

08:58.230 --> 09:01.373
Grace,
do you copy?

09:04.027 --> 09:06.420
Go for Grace.

09:13.003 --> 09:14.486
Daniel.

09:14.488 --> 09:16.913
I got
a bunch of great records...

09:16.915 --> 09:18.840
Chuck Berry,
John Lee Hooker,

09:18.842 --> 09:20.158
Traveling Wilburys.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.177
That was the convoy.

09:22.179 --> 09:24.587
The oil fields...

09:24.589 --> 09:26.515
we lost them.

09:34.508 --> 09:37.433
<i>I-I don't understand.</i>

09:37.435 --> 09:40.788
<i>I mean, I'll do this,
but what's it for?</i>

09:40.790 --> 09:44.291
<i>Just start
with your name.</i>

09:44.293 --> 09:47.202
<i>Tom.
My name's Tom.</i>

09:47.204 --> 09:50.446
<i>See, Tom,
it's not gonna be so bad.</i>

09:50.448 --> 09:52.040
<i>I promise.</i>

09:52.042 --> 09:54.209
<i>Where you from?</i>

09:54.211 --> 09:56.044
<i>Paradise Ridge.</i>

09:56.046 --> 09:58.806
<i>What's that,
a-a city, town?</i>

09:58.808 --> 10:02.884
<i>Th-This... Whatever this is,
this isn't gonna work.</i>

10:02.886 --> 10:05.053
It will.

10:05.055 --> 10:08.557
Whatever you're running from,
people need to know.

10:08.559 --> 10:10.709
You can trust us,
Tom.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.237
Whatever happened before,
that's not what we're about.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.732
It's a condo complex.

10:17.734 --> 10:19.827
- Like a settlement?
- A few dozen people.

10:19.829 --> 10:21.887
Most of us
lived there before.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.905
I was the president
of the HOA.

10:23.907 --> 10:26.741
Only got the job
'cause no one ran against me.

10:26.743 --> 10:29.728
Then two weeks later,
the dead started walking,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.839
and everyone looked at me
like I knew what I was doing.

10:31.841 --> 10:33.674
Well, you must have
'cause you're still here.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.250
No, I got lucky.

10:35.252 --> 10:36.844
The building had security.

10:36.846 --> 10:39.087
Half the units
hadn't been sold yet,

10:39.089 --> 10:40.496
so we had room
to spread out.

10:40.498 --> 10:42.498
We used the pool
to filter water.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.001
There's a rooftop garden
to grow vegetables.

10:45.003 --> 10:46.669
So what
are you doin' here?

10:46.671 --> 10:48.580
Like I said,
I got lucky.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.190
And then
I got unlucky.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.675
Our water supply
started to go bad.

10:52.677 --> 10:54.194
We couldn't grow food.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.571
The fence failed.

10:55.573 --> 10:57.480
The roof started leaking.

10:57.482 --> 11:02.110
We were ready to split
before they showed up.

11:02.112 --> 11:03.945
- People on the horses.
- Did they attack you?

11:03.947 --> 11:06.356
No. They showed up
and offered to help.

11:06.358 --> 11:09.284
They said they'd clean
our water supply,

11:09.286 --> 11:12.120
get us food while we figured out
how to grow our own,

11:12.122 --> 11:13.438
fix the walls,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.198
the roof,
whatever else we needed.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.292
So what happened?
Why are they chasing you?

11:17.294 --> 11:18.886
They said it was my fault

11:18.888 --> 11:21.221
that things had gotten
to the place that they had.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.539
<i>They said they were trying
to build something bigger,</i>

11:23.541 --> 11:25.117
<i>something better.</i>

11:25.119 --> 11:26.785
<i>They said
that it wasn't about today.</i>

11:26.787 --> 11:27.969
<i>It was about tomorrow.</i>

11:27.971 --> 11:30.713
I just wasn't
part of it.

11:30.715 --> 11:33.959
My sister, Janis,
she's still in there.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.794
They tried to kill me.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.129
They'll do
the same thing to her

11:37.131 --> 11:38.630
if I don't get her out.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.556
Back up for a second.
Walk me through this.

11:40.558 --> 11:42.892
- When they talked about today and tomorrow...
- Al.

11:42.894 --> 11:45.561
- ...what did they say exactly?
- Just what I told you.

11:45.563 --> 11:48.564
They said what they were doing
wasn't about today.

11:48.566 --> 11:50.250
It was
about tomorrow.

11:50.252 --> 11:52.753
All they cared about
was the future.

11:54.857 --> 11:57.816
You heard what he said
about his sister, right?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.579
We'll get her out.

12:03.581 --> 12:06.916
We'll go in,
and we'll get her out.

12:25.937 --> 12:27.770
We're clear.
Open her up.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.434
So, they're in and out
every couple of hours.

13:06.436 --> 13:08.829
They really want
to find you.

13:09.973 --> 13:12.165
Probably shouldn't even
be this close, Tom.

13:14.003 --> 13:16.336
I just don't understand
what they want with this place.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.505
I don't know.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.049
Whatever it was,
they didn't want me to see.

13:22.419 --> 13:24.252
Alright.

13:24.254 --> 13:26.805
You don't
have to do this.

13:30.335 --> 13:33.428
Al, you gonna be smart
about this?

13:33.430 --> 13:36.264
Gotta get in there before
something happens to his sister.

13:36.266 --> 13:37.766
Or we could wait

13:37.768 --> 13:40.085
till the people that are
after him are not in there.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.753
Well, we don't know
when that's gonna be.

13:41.755 --> 13:43.012
You need
to be in there now.

13:43.014 --> 13:44.364
That is
about his sister, right?

13:44.366 --> 13:46.091
It's not about
just chasing a story.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.367
How can you even ask me
that question?

13:49.204 --> 13:50.662
Fair.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.783
Look,
it's not about a story.

13:55.860 --> 13:58.453
I don't want you
to go in there on your own.

13:58.455 --> 14:00.630
If you think
he needs to get to safety,

14:00.632 --> 14:01.882
get him to safety.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.699
I can get in,
get out

14:03.701 --> 14:06.386
without any of those assholes
knowing I was ever inside.

14:09.466 --> 14:12.059
Just said it was not about
chasing a story.

14:12.061 --> 14:13.968
It's not.

14:13.970 --> 14:16.063
He's not the only one
who needs something in there.

14:16.065 --> 14:18.065
What does that mean?

14:19.551 --> 14:21.050
Just trust me
on this.

15:03.687 --> 15:06.855
Come on.

15:06.857 --> 15:09.616
Come on.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.534
What the hell?

15:19.536 --> 15:21.019
You're welcome.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.779
They clear the dead
whenever they kill them.

15:23.781 --> 15:25.540
I just
have to get one close,

15:25.542 --> 15:28.260
and then
we can get in.

15:30.046 --> 15:33.431
You're not
goin' in there alone, Al.

15:34.626 --> 15:36.852
Ain't goin' in there
at all.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.209
You wanna tell me

15:44.211 --> 15:46.211
who it is
we're lookin' for in there?

15:46.213 --> 15:47.470
Tom's sister.

15:47.472 --> 15:50.565
Who is it
you're lookin' for, Al?

15:52.161 --> 15:55.220
I have trusted you
with a lot.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.072
Think you could
do the same for me.

15:59.484 --> 16:01.484
- Have you?
- Yeah.

16:01.486 --> 16:03.578
Jenny.
The tapes.

16:03.580 --> 16:05.063
Duane.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.657
Yeah, told me a lot
about where you've been.

16:07.659 --> 16:09.176
Yeah.

16:09.178 --> 16:11.827
You haven't told me shit about
where you're at right now.

16:11.829 --> 16:13.755
What are you
talkin' about?

16:13.757 --> 16:15.348
Why don't you wanna
go back to the convoy?

16:16.426 --> 16:19.335
We're droppin' help boxes,
settin' up outposts.

16:19.337 --> 16:20.929
We're doin'
what we do.

16:20.931 --> 16:23.748
You're doin'
that thing you did when...

16:23.750 --> 16:25.859
when I first
interviewed you.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.435
And what is that?

16:27.437 --> 16:30.422
Runnin' from somethin'.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.607
Don't know what.

16:50.460 --> 16:53.278
Try not
to kill this one, okay?

17:01.063 --> 17:03.471
We fried
the transmission.

17:07.885 --> 17:09.794
We're pulling
too much weight.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.301
Tess,
do you copy?

17:17.304 --> 17:19.579
I'm here, Grace.

17:19.580 --> 17:23.324
We're gonna be a while
before we get to the rendezvous.

17:23.326 --> 17:25.877
Copy that. Let us know
if you need any help.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.425
I wish
we were there.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.487
When it happened,
maybe we could've helped.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.322
But we were helping.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.823
We got supplies.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.843
All this stuff.

17:41.845 --> 17:45.730
We could
come back for it later.

17:50.854 --> 17:53.262
Made
the classic mistake.

17:53.264 --> 17:56.174
I thought we could bring back
everything we found.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.844
Usually, I'm the one
who's more of a realist.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.679
There was no way
we could know

18:01.681 --> 18:03.456
what was
gonna happen, Grace.

18:04.868 --> 18:06.626
A year ago,
I was a realist.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.296
I could not imagine
I would be here with you,

18:09.298 --> 18:12.114
doing good things,
trying to help people,

18:12.116 --> 18:16.044
making things right,
and here I am.

18:16.046 --> 18:20.715
You, me, and a cat
with serious behavioral issues.

18:22.960 --> 18:27.939
Bein' a realist is not
a realistic option anymore.

18:35.732 --> 18:37.398
There's some places

18:37.400 --> 18:42.053
we might be able to hole up
a couple of miles from here.

18:42.055 --> 18:46.315
Moon's bright enough tonight
we can make it on foot.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.327
Oh.

19:46.544 --> 19:48.953
Ah, shit.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.969
Morgan.

20:26.493 --> 20:30.161
That tanker...
it's ours.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.222
Not anymore.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.515
Where you goin'?

20:50.517 --> 20:51.941
You're right.

20:51.943 --> 20:54.352
I have been avoiding
going back to the convoy.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.170
Why?

20:56.172 --> 20:59.782
It's complicated.
But if something has happened to them...

20:59.784 --> 21:03.452
- Morgan, there's no way we can... We don't know that.
- If it has... If it has, it is my fault.

21:03.454 --> 21:04.879
It is.

21:04.881 --> 21:07.122
What is it
you think you can do?

21:07.124 --> 21:08.975
I'm gonna talk to them. I'm
gonna find out how they got...

21:08.977 --> 21:11.369
- They see you here, they will kill you.
- You don't know that.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.553
- I do.
- How?

21:13.890 --> 21:15.890
This
"bigger, better,

21:15.892 --> 21:17.800
building towards the future"
stuff,

21:17.802 --> 21:19.134
I have
heard it before.

21:19.136 --> 21:20.528
From who?

21:22.139 --> 21:25.140
Someone whose organization

21:25.142 --> 21:28.720
might be working
with these people.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.499
Someone I never thought
I'd see again.

21:32.501 --> 21:34.984
And you're
lookin' for 'em?

21:36.487 --> 21:37.895
Yeah.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.248
Then go look.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.333
I'll find
Tom's sister.

21:42.335 --> 21:45.995
And I'm gonna find out
how they've got our truck.

21:57.674 --> 21:59.584
There's a bar
just ahead.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.937
And not
a moment too soon.

22:02.939 --> 22:04.922
It's Skidmark's dinnertime,

22:04.924 --> 22:07.925
and he is very particular
about schedules.

22:10.521 --> 22:12.688
He's lucky
to have you.

22:12.690 --> 22:15.542
After all this cat
has done for me,

22:15.544 --> 22:18.360
the least I can do
is feed him.

22:18.362 --> 22:19.620
What do you mean?

22:19.622 --> 22:22.273
For a long time,
he was all I had.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.533
We ate together,

22:24.535 --> 22:29.130
we listened
to music together,

22:29.132 --> 22:32.784
and, for a while,
it seemed like

22:32.786 --> 22:35.228
that's the way
it was gonna stay.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.288
What changed?

22:37.290 --> 22:38.790
Well...

22:54.808 --> 22:57.658
Aw, no respect
for vinyl.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.743
Daniel.

23:07.745 --> 23:11.246
Get the crate.

23:11.248 --> 23:13.507
We gotta
get outta here.

23:13.509 --> 23:14.826
Now!

23:45.208 --> 23:47.616
Janis?

24:21.060 --> 24:23.077
She's not here.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.416
You find
what you're lookin' for?

24:28.418 --> 24:31.068
Not yet.

26:43.202 --> 26:46.145
It looks like she took care of
whoever was comin' after her,

26:46.147 --> 26:48.372
but he might still be a problem
for us.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.557
Copy that.

26:51.635 --> 26:54.136
Al,
we gotta go... now.

28:08.879 --> 28:11.122
You okay?

28:11.124 --> 28:12.473
Thank you.

28:12.475 --> 28:14.975
We gotta
get the hell outta here.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.479
Whew!

28:18.481 --> 28:23.134
Generator's purrin' like
a kitten in catnip coop.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.894
You two sure know
how to make an entrance.

28:45.748 --> 28:48.325
We're on our way.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.852
Copy.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.777
They're gonna kill us
like they tried to kill Tom.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.504
I think
they would've done it by now.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.931
We've been here.
We've seen this place.

29:02.933 --> 29:04.692
That's enough.
Believe me.

29:04.694 --> 29:07.203
Let's just find out
what they gotta say.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.307
Sorry to
keep you waitin',

29:11.309 --> 29:14.168
but you did leave quite a mess
in the pool.

29:17.373 --> 29:19.256
Strawberry or apricot?

29:22.286 --> 29:23.944
Hmm?

29:23.946 --> 29:26.263
We make both.

29:28.625 --> 29:32.269
Here, why don't you try
a little of each?

29:39.937 --> 29:43.138
I'm sorry.

29:43.140 --> 29:46.158
We should probably start
with the basics first.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.661
I know you're Morgan,
and you're Al.

29:48.663 --> 29:51.555
I'm Virginia.
Folks call me Ginny.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.057
How do you know
our names?

29:53.059 --> 29:54.408
I saw your tape.

29:54.410 --> 29:56.151
It was a hoot.

29:56.153 --> 30:00.155
I never considered "documentary
to spread the word" angle

30:00.157 --> 30:02.583
until I saw yours.

30:02.585 --> 30:04.568
Very smart.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.972
So, what brings you
to Paradise Ridge?

30:09.559 --> 30:12.576
Where's Janis?

30:12.578 --> 30:15.746
Oh, you ran into Tom,
didn't you?

30:15.748 --> 30:18.399
Well,
Janis must've run off

30:18.401 --> 30:20.108
right after
her brother did.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.177
Turns out,
she left a nice, little surprise

30:22.179 --> 30:23.437
in her room, too.

30:23.439 --> 30:25.055
You tried
to kill him.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.682
No, we're tryin'
to preserve this place.

30:27.684 --> 30:30.369
It'll be a lot easier
now that we have gas.

30:30.371 --> 30:32.112
What did you do
to our friends?

30:32.114 --> 30:34.047
Your friends are fine.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.433
Unless you considered Logan
a friend,

30:36.435 --> 30:38.619
in which case,
my condolences.

30:38.621 --> 30:40.379
You had no right
to take it.

30:40.381 --> 30:44.199
We're tryin' to do
the same thing you are.

30:44.201 --> 30:46.701
Well,
not tryin'.

30:46.703 --> 30:48.112
Doin' it.

30:49.331 --> 30:51.039
You wanna help people.

30:51.041 --> 30:52.541
So do we.

30:52.543 --> 30:54.727
We just have different ideas
on how to accomplish it.

30:54.729 --> 30:56.878
Yeah, you kill,
and we don't.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.305
Spaghetti ain't simple,

30:58.307 --> 31:00.641
and it's usually messy
one way or another.

31:00.643 --> 31:02.976
We could help you, too,
if you'd let us.

31:02.978 --> 31:04.962
Really?

31:04.964 --> 31:06.322
How?

31:10.152 --> 31:11.744
How's it been,

31:11.746 --> 31:14.538
dealin' with the loss
of your family?

31:17.143 --> 31:19.143
You should talk
to Miss Phieffer.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.545
She's an MFT,
not a full headshrinker, now,

31:21.547 --> 31:24.498
but, man,
she helps with perspective.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.999
Bad patterns.

31:26.001 --> 31:28.502
She travels between
the bigger settlements.

31:28.504 --> 31:31.097
She talks to people.
She's good.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.766
How big
are the settlements?

31:33.768 --> 31:35.250
Like...

31:35.252 --> 31:37.586
they have helicopters?

31:37.588 --> 31:39.663
Helicopters?

31:39.665 --> 31:43.258
Honey, we just got
a gas supply yesterday.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.903
What made you have
that crazy idea?

31:46.948 --> 31:49.139
I just wanted
to know.

31:50.118 --> 31:54.936
Darlin',
I am an open book.

31:57.850 --> 31:59.792
Ah, I wish
we could chat for longer,

31:59.794 --> 32:01.685
but you got
a lot of work to do.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.371
I told your friends the same
thing I'll tell you now.

32:04.373 --> 32:06.206
Our doors
are always open to you.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.900
That's it?

32:07.902 --> 32:09.376
We're free to go?

32:09.378 --> 32:10.694
That's right.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.713
And I can
keep the tape?

32:12.715 --> 32:14.456
I want you to show it
to as many people

32:14.458 --> 32:15.699
as you possibly can.

32:16.793 --> 32:18.385
The future's
a lot easier to get to

32:18.387 --> 32:20.003
when you're not
doin' it on your own.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.538
You think
this is about the future,

32:21.540 --> 32:23.816
but what you're doin',
it's about the past.

32:23.818 --> 32:26.543
It's about holdin' onto it
no matter what the cost.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.895
Oh, Morgan,

32:27.897 --> 32:30.381
I guess we'll just have to
agree to disagree.

32:37.406 --> 32:40.224
Oh,
I completely forgot.

32:44.079 --> 32:45.729
They always
remember these things.

33:08.103 --> 33:10.362
We have a woodworker
in our community.

33:12.099 --> 33:14.200
He's a real craftsman.

33:17.430 --> 33:20.931
I asked him if he could
fix your stick for you.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.933
He was happy
to oblige.

33:24.770 --> 33:27.362
Says that joint should hold up
to whatever you throw at it.

33:27.364 --> 33:28.956
Huh.

33:28.958 --> 33:31.625
Thank you.

33:31.627 --> 33:33.368
Sure thing.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.565
This is the future,
Morgan.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.400
You just
don't see it yet.

34:05.402 --> 34:06.735
But you will.

34:06.737 --> 34:08.754
Well,
unless you die out there.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.589
People tend
to do that.

34:10.591 --> 34:14.652
Which is why
we're doin' what we're doin'

34:14.654 --> 34:16.762
and why
you should join us.

34:26.774 --> 34:28.422
Go on.

34:28.425 --> 34:31.335
Suck on a stone when
you could be slurpin' soup.

34:48.020 --> 34:50.129
Daniel.

34:51.540 --> 34:53.132
Rustled you up
some breakfast.

34:54.784 --> 34:57.861
It's not
quite Cinnabon,

34:57.863 --> 35:01.640
but Cinnabon-adjacent,
maybe?

35:01.642 --> 35:03.142
Thank you.

35:09.650 --> 35:13.152
There's no way those records
survived the night.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.486
I'm sorry.

35:14.488 --> 35:17.489
They may not
have stomped them all.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.052
I wanted her to listen
to the Traveling Wilburys.

35:22.054 --> 35:23.403
- Who?
- Charlie.

35:23.405 --> 35:25.980
That's who
you got them for?

35:25.982 --> 35:27.166
Uh-huh.

35:28.502 --> 35:30.410
You asked me
what changed.

35:30.412 --> 35:33.196
When did it stop being
just Skidmark and me

35:33.198 --> 35:34.447
and the warehouse?

35:34.449 --> 35:36.750
It was Charlie.

35:36.752 --> 35:40.995
Nothing felt the same to me
after she showed up.

35:40.997 --> 35:43.674
You think
you know what it is

35:43.676 --> 35:47.168
that you're gonna
leave behind.

35:47.170 --> 35:51.598
I thought it would be
my daughter, Ofelia,

35:51.600 --> 35:55.586
but things don't always go
the way you think.

35:55.588 --> 35:58.822
No,
they don't.

36:02.853 --> 36:06.205
If things don't go
the way I think,

36:06.207 --> 36:08.265
do me a favor.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.418
Keep an eye on Charlie
and Skidmark.

36:12.863 --> 36:14.121
Okay.

36:15.274 --> 36:16.790
But the first thing
I'm gonna do

36:16.792 --> 36:19.292
is find someone else
to keep an eye on them.

36:19.294 --> 36:22.112
I thought you were
looking toward the future.

36:22.114 --> 36:24.873
It's not about
how long I've got.

36:24.875 --> 36:28.635
Back at the mall,
I decided that

36:28.637 --> 36:32.064
I would start living
for something beyond today.

36:32.066 --> 36:34.883
Seemed like a good idea
at the time,

36:34.885 --> 36:38.962
but I have a bad record
of making things worse.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.483
I try not
to blame myself too much.

36:43.485 --> 36:45.819
I know
that's indulgent.

36:45.821 --> 36:48.488
What is troubling you,
Grace?

36:49.900 --> 36:51.308
Morgan.

36:52.661 --> 36:55.312
I thought
I could help him.

36:55.314 --> 36:56.905
I tried.

36:59.318 --> 37:03.228
I think you've helped that man
more than you can imagine.

37:03.230 --> 37:06.156
I saw him
in the mall.

37:06.158 --> 37:08.600
He was smiling.

37:08.602 --> 37:12.496
Smile, smile till he
run out of cheek.

37:14.491 --> 37:17.167
Are you sure?

37:17.169 --> 37:19.519
Yes.

37:24.768 --> 37:27.010
You want Charlie
to hear the Wilburys?

37:27.012 --> 37:29.847
Maybe we don't
need records.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.292
What do you mean?

37:34.778 --> 37:37.111
I took some lessons
when I was a kid.

37:37.113 --> 37:39.206
I might be able
to pick it up.

37:39.208 --> 37:42.301
We could
teach Charlie together.

37:46.307 --> 37:49.791
What makes you think
I can sing?

38:08.645 --> 38:13.314
♪ Well, it's alright ♪

38:13.316 --> 38:15.909
♪ Ridin' around
with the breeze ♪

38:15.911 --> 38:20.989
♪ Well, it's alright ♪

38:20.991 --> 38:24.584

38:24.586 --> 38:28.997

38:28.999 --> 38:31.816

38:31.818 --> 38:36.763

38:36.765 --> 38:41.159
♪ As long

38:56.785 --> 38:59.244
I'm so sorry.

39:00.172 --> 39:03.031
All last night you spent
tryin' to help me,

39:03.033 --> 39:04.383
tryin' to
find Janis.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.867
We told you
we would.

39:05.869 --> 39:08.036
She wasn't even there.

39:08.038 --> 39:11.214
You could've been out
looking for your own people.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.041
I got you into this.

39:13.043 --> 39:16.803
Hey, we needed
to see it for ourselves.

39:16.805 --> 39:19.306
Now we have.

39:20.317 --> 39:22.575
Put your faith
in us, Tom.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.719
Told you
we were gonna help,

39:24.721 --> 39:27.614
and we're not gonna give up
till we have.

39:29.301 --> 39:31.651
Tank's almost empty.

39:31.653 --> 39:34.821
Really hope there's enough
in that gas can back there

39:34.823 --> 39:38.083
to get us
to the rendezvous.

39:47.428 --> 39:49.577
<i>So, let's pick up
where we left off...</i>

39:49.579 --> 39:51.321
<i>the, uh...
the card</i>

39:51.323 --> 39:52.839
<i>that Duane made you
for Father's Day.</i>

39:52.841 --> 39:54.324
<i>Card.</i>

39:54.326 --> 39:56.768
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:56.770 --> 39:59.229
<i>You know, that was...</i>

40:13.345 --> 40:16.513
<i>Person you were lookin' for
in that place,</i>

40:16.515 --> 40:18.415
<i>you care about 'em?</i>

40:20.961 --> 40:23.595
It's not
about me now.

40:23.597 --> 40:25.088
It's about both of us,
isn't it?

40:28.802 --> 40:31.136
Yeah.

40:34.791 --> 40:36.600
I care about her.

40:38.720 --> 40:42.889
I also c-care about
where she was from,

40:42.891 --> 40:45.150
what they were doing.

40:46.228 --> 40:49.279
She talked a lot
about the future.

40:51.141 --> 40:56.286
I just wanted there
to be a connection, so I...

40:58.148 --> 41:02.459
Virginia, what she's doing,
this is not that.

41:12.162 --> 41:14.162
So, um...

41:14.164 --> 41:16.139
the card.

41:24.692 --> 41:28.527
I told Virginia
she was holdin' onto the past

41:28.529 --> 41:31.863
no matter
what it cost.

41:33.516 --> 41:35.349
<i>She's not the only one.</i>

41:42.434 --> 41:44.918
<i>I don't think
I need to do this anymore.</i>

41:46.438 --> 41:48.755
<i>I, um...</i>

41:49.958 --> 41:53.343
<i>Yeah, I think I'm good.</i>

41:54.421 --> 41:56.388
Okay.

42:12.573 --> 42:15.632
Grace,
do you copy?

42:17.227 --> 42:20.153
Grace?

42:20.155 --> 42:22.472
Grace, if you're hearin' this,
tell me where you are.

42:22.474 --> 42:24.824
I need...

42:26.236 --> 42:28.645
We need to talk.

42:28.647 --> 42:30.905
Morgan.

42:30.907 --> 42:32.832
Daniel, hey.

42:32.834 --> 42:35.001
Are you with Grace?

42:35.003 --> 42:37.578
Yes. We were heading back
to the convoy,

42:37.580 --> 42:39.155
and she seemed fine.

42:39.157 --> 42:42.416
Then... And then,
suddenly, it changed.

42:43.662 --> 42:46.012
I wanna talk to her.

42:47.332 --> 42:50.609
Grace. Grace.
It's Morgan.

43:00.937 --> 43:03.087
Morgan.

43:03.089 --> 43:06.291
Hey. Hey.
Where are you?

43:06.293 --> 43:08.442
We'll come to you.

43:08.444 --> 43:10.036
I'm not sure.

43:10.038 --> 43:12.280
We were on our way
to the rendezvous.

43:12.282 --> 43:13.706
Are you okay?

43:13.708 --> 43:14.966
Mm.

43:14.968 --> 43:17.602
I'm not sure,
Morgan.

43:21.883 --> 43:23.199
Mm.

43:25.295 --> 43:28.054
What I was
worried about...

43:28.056 --> 43:31.708
I think
it's happening.

43:37.549 --> 43:42.518
Just tell me where you are,
and, um, we'll be there.

43:42.520 --> 43:46.906
Mm. Mm.

43:48.727 --> 43:52.671
We are at a bar
just south of the 290 junction.

43:52.673 --> 43:55.398
290.
Copy that.

44:01.682 --> 44:04.165
I hope I see you.

44:04.167 --> 44:06.926
I'd like to see
that smile again.

44:09.857 --> 44:12.098
I just...

44:12.100 --> 44:14.751
I don't think there's...

44:14.753 --> 44:18.012
much time left.

44:29.710 --> 44:33.786
Thank you, Daniel,
for singing with me.

44:33.788 --> 44:35.881
You're gonna be okay.

44:35.883 --> 44:37.883
Okay.

44:37.885 --> 44:40.960
I won't be
a realist, then.
