WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:04.770
If you hold
something in the air

00:04.772 --> 00:06.472
And let it fall,

00:06.474 --> 00:10.509
The law of inertia
says it should stay there.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.677
But it falls.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.678
Why does it fall?

00:18.151 --> 00:19.718
Something called...

00:23.323 --> 00:25.624
Anyone?

00:27.727 --> 00:28.761
It's gravity.

00:28.763 --> 00:31.630
And gravity
should not be...

00:50.683 --> 00:52.484
If I drop this shoe

00:52.486 --> 00:54.453
And this hair comb
at the same time,

00:54.455 --> 00:56.155
Which one
will hit the ground first?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.556
[students]: The shoe!

01:01.461 --> 01:04.163
Miss thatcher,
why didn't the shoe hit first?

01:04.165 --> 01:05.297
It's heavier.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.832
Remember I said

01:06.834 --> 01:08.567
That gravity is the force
that pulls things to the earth?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.969
Well, even though
the earth pulls stronger

01:10.971 --> 01:12.805
On a heavier object
like the shoe,

01:12.807 --> 01:15.374
That heavy object
is more reluctant to get moving.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.942
So it's a tie?

01:16.944 --> 01:19.244
That's right, emily,
it's a tie.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.479
Now it's your turn
to give it a try.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.481
I want each of you

01:22.483 --> 01:24.283
To partner up with a person
sitting next to you,

01:24.285 --> 01:26.685
Get up on a chair,

01:26.687 --> 01:28.253
And pick
two objects to drop.

01:36.362 --> 01:37.196
But nothing breakable, please.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.698
One...

02:26.246 --> 02:28.947
There are times
when I miss home.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.216
Doing laundry is
definitely one of them.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.484
Let me guess,

02:32.486 --> 02:35.254
Fresh, clean wardrobe
in your closet

02:35.256 --> 02:36.255
Every day of the week,

02:36.257 --> 02:38.624
Clean, starched,

02:38.626 --> 02:40.259
Pressed with
a big steam iron?

02:40.261 --> 02:42.294
Yes.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.729
Well, you think
life is hard now,

02:43.731 --> 02:44.830
Wait till winter,

02:44.832 --> 02:45.831
When you have to sit in there

02:45.833 --> 02:47.733
When the mercury
is below zero.

02:49.769 --> 02:52.971
Then you're really
going to miss home.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.340
[spurlock]:
You get the next house down.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.176
[hammering]

03:04.918 --> 03:06.718
Can I help you,
mr. Spurlock?

03:06.720 --> 03:09.354
Everything you need to know
is on the notice, ma'am.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.696
[sighs heavily]

03:17.698 --> 03:19.765
What is it, abigail?

03:22.502 --> 03:23.569
"by order of henry gowen,

03:23.571 --> 03:24.903
"executive director

03:24.905 --> 03:26.438
"of the pacific northwest
mining company,

03:26.440 --> 03:29.775
"you are hereby given
14 days advance notice

03:29.777 --> 03:31.710
To vacate
your company-owned house."

03:32.845 --> 03:34.513
It's just the widows

03:34.515 --> 03:35.948
Who are getting
these, abigail.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.716
They're making room
for the miners.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.284
How can they do that?

03:39.286 --> 03:40.719
It's immoral.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.454
And 100% legal.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.690
Oh, I didn't see this coming,
but I should have.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.796
Both my children
were born in this town.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.431
It's the only home they know.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.133
Now, I don't want to
break their hearts,

03:55.135 --> 03:56.935
But that company's
leaving me no choice.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.471
I wrote a letter
to my mama in lethbridge,

03:59.473 --> 04:01.506
Asking if we could
move in with her.

04:01.508 --> 04:02.541
You did the right thing.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.675
No one can blame you.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.043
May I make a suggestion?

04:07.447 --> 04:09.815
I've been
thinking this over,

04:09.817 --> 04:11.717
And perhaps
if you pooled your money,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.685
You could hire a lawyer
to fight this for you.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.020
Little miss princess,

04:15.022 --> 04:16.421
You can think about it
till the cows come home,

04:16.423 --> 04:17.956
But if I gave up

04:17.958 --> 04:19.758
What's left of my husband's
measly death pension,

04:19.760 --> 04:20.859
I'd have nothin' left
to start over with.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.394
I've got no money.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.528
Me neither.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.530
I've got no money
for fancy lawyers.

04:25.532 --> 04:26.665
[widows all murmuring
in agreement]

04:26.667 --> 04:27.933
I don't know
about the rest of you,

04:27.935 --> 04:30.435
But I'm not ready to give up.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.570
Mr. Gowen is right.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.740
If the company is
recruiting new miners

04:34.742 --> 04:37.542
To replace our husbands,

04:37.544 --> 04:38.944
Then I think
it's time for us widows

04:38.946 --> 04:41.113
To fade into the background

04:41.115 --> 04:43.815
And the new miners to show up.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.725
[♪]

05:01.634 --> 05:04.036
Boys got the last
of the inner shafts

05:04.038 --> 05:05.437
Cleared of the roof-fall
yesterday.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.905
-Retimbered, too?
-Almost.

05:06.907 --> 05:07.873
But some of
the deeper sections

05:07.875 --> 05:09.541
Are still blocked.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.577
Shafts 14 and 16
are still closed.

05:12.579 --> 05:13.845
I'm counting on you,
mr. Ansvil.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.882
It's why I named you
my new superintendent.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.050
I know, sir,

05:18.052 --> 05:19.217
And I'm doin'
the best I can.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.053
I just don't have
the manpower

05:21.055 --> 05:23.555
To clear those shafts
any faster.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.090
Well, shouldn't be
a worry too much longer.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.192
I've been doing
some recruiting.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.928
Help should be
on its way soon.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.100
Who in god's name
are those men?

05:42.075 --> 05:43.108
You're recruiting
more miners?

05:43.110 --> 05:45.010
You got 'em.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.646
Respectfully, ladies,
is this some kind of joke?

05:47.648 --> 05:49.448
No joke, mr. Gowen.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.782
You need workers.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.452
We need roofs
over our children's heads.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.619
You lost
your husbands in there.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.988
What happens
to your children

05:56.990 --> 05:58.790
If they lose you?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.660
Who puts roofs
over their heads then?

06:01.662 --> 06:02.661
Mr. Gowen,
we're offering to do this

06:02.663 --> 06:03.795
With our eyes open,

06:03.797 --> 06:05.997
And we're
counting the cost.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.699
We have to try.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.701
Coal valley is our home.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.070
All we're asking for
is a chance.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.740
Everybody knows
you still have shafts blocked.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.975
You tell us which one
you want open.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.277
If we have it cleared
and timbered

06:19.279 --> 06:20.212
Between now
and the evictions...

06:20.214 --> 06:21.646
You get to stay in your homes?

06:23.883 --> 06:25.150
What happens if you don't?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.818
We leave quietly.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.587
We'll even give the row houses
a proper spring-cleaning

06:28.589 --> 06:29.621
Before we vacate.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.894
You have two weeks.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.562
As well,

06:37.564 --> 06:39.264
None of the men
who work for me may help you.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.834
I will not
compromise their safety.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.570
Fair enough.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.174
Mr. Ansvil.

06:51.043 --> 06:54.179
Ladies, line up
and sign your waiver.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.148
I'm flabbergasted
you agreed to this.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.716
We both know

06:57.718 --> 07:00.619
They won't last more than
a week, mr. Spurlock.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.053
And in the meantime,

07:02.055 --> 07:04.022
Perhaps they'll get
some of that shaft cleared,

07:14.867 --> 07:16.835
I hope you have a plan
for moving these boxes

07:16.837 --> 07:17.736
From the front
of my building,

07:17.738 --> 07:19.004
Miss thatcher.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.705
I'm sorry,
are they for me?

07:20.707 --> 07:23.275
Well, unless they've changed
how whiskey is spelled,

07:23.277 --> 07:25.544
I doubt they're mine.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.766
Need some help?

07:49.135 --> 07:51.269
[grunting with effort]

07:51.271 --> 07:52.204
May I?

07:56.509 --> 07:58.143
If you wish.

08:01.848 --> 08:02.914
After you.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.388
I can't tell you
how thrilled I am

08:10.390 --> 08:11.990
To have my collection
replaced.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.959
It will be an absolute
treasure for my students.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.996
This for your students, too?

08:26.873 --> 08:28.273
[gasps]

08:28.275 --> 08:30.475
A journal.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.577
I already have
so much to write about.

08:32.579 --> 08:33.979
Be sure to mention

08:33.981 --> 08:35.213
How your father
got me posted here

08:35.215 --> 08:36.915
Babysitting his daughter

08:36.917 --> 08:37.916
Instead of chasing pirates
and whiskey-runners

08:37.918 --> 08:41.219
In cape fullerton.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.621
Good morning, children.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.122
Good morning,
miss thatcher.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.824
Good morning,
miss thatcher.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.158
So we're back to
cape fullerton, are we?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.126
I thought we'd made
our peace with that.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.995
We did.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.830
Just don't want you to forget

08:51.832 --> 08:53.698
That as long as you're tied
to your father's apron strings,

08:53.700 --> 08:55.166
I will be, too.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.868
Good day, miss thatcher.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.970
Constable.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.805
Children, I have
a surprise for you

09:00.807 --> 09:01.940
This morning.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.241
Everyone drop off
your lunch pails

09:03.243 --> 09:05.110
And then gather around
these boxes.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.711
What's in 'em?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.113
Go ahead, see for yourselves.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.449
I've never seen
so many fancy dresses.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.184
Are they all yours,
miss thatcher?

09:13.186 --> 09:16.755
Uh, that's not the crate
I wanted to show you.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.323
Look at
all these shoes!

09:18.325 --> 09:20.892
Okay, let's go find
another one, shall we?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.794
Whoa, look at all these books!

09:22.796 --> 09:23.995
That ain't no surprise.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.897
Well, sure it is, james.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.066
Thanks to a generous gift,

09:28.068 --> 09:30.302
We have books on
just about every subject.

09:30.304 --> 09:31.736
And from now on,

09:31.738 --> 09:33.271
We'll be able to explore
the entire world

09:33.273 --> 09:34.706
Through reading.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.640
Isn't that exciting?

09:36.776 --> 09:37.676
No.

09:44.784 --> 09:47.319
[crying]

09:47.321 --> 09:48.620
Rachel...

09:50.723 --> 09:53.091
What's wrong?

09:53.093 --> 09:56.394
I don't want
to leave coal valley.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.063
Neither do I.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.969
Everyone, grab
a workbook and pencil

10:03.971 --> 10:05.604
And then take your seats.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.277
In your best words,

10:12.279 --> 10:15.847
I want you to write
a short essay on this topic...

10:17.216 --> 10:19.284
"coal valley...

10:22.188 --> 10:25.256
"...Is my home

10:25.258 --> 10:27.626
Because..."

10:29.795 --> 10:31.363
You all have
your pit-checks now.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.634
Make sure they go
back on the board

10:35.636 --> 10:38.069
So we know who's in
and who's out of the mine.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.239
Any questions?

10:44.276 --> 10:46.044
All right.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.946
Ladies, follow me
to shaft number 14.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.093
[♪]

11:06.565 --> 11:11.202
Ladies,
this is to keep our homes.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.846
If that canary stops singing
for 15 minutes,

11:21.848 --> 11:24.516
I want you
high-tailing it out of here.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.885
Too much methane? Boom.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.121
Too much c-o-2? Boom.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.023
And with those open lamps
you got on your heads,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.258
Too much coal dust--

11:33.260 --> 11:34.926
We get it, herbert.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.063
Get to work.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.002
Let's put our lunch boxes here.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.375
[cassandra]:
<i>Coal valley is my home...</i>

11:50.377 --> 11:53.945
Because I can't remember
living anywhere else.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.547
My first memory
of being here

11:55.549 --> 11:57.882
Is my daddy
jumpin' off the wagon

11:57.884 --> 11:59.484
And fallin' to the ground,

11:59.486 --> 12:01.286
Just on that street
out there.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.287
Then...

12:02.289 --> 12:04.055
He kissed the dirt

12:04.057 --> 12:05.757
And thanked the good lord
for givin' us

12:05.759 --> 12:08.560
A second chance.

12:08.562 --> 12:09.961
[applause]

12:09.963 --> 12:11.129
That was wonderful,
cassandra.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.498
Thank you for sharing.

12:15.935 --> 12:16.868
Gabe,

12:16.870 --> 12:20.271
You're next.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.940
Mine's
kind of short.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.914
Coal valley is my home

12:29.916 --> 12:32.016
Because it's where I got
my first kiss.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.152
[students giggle]

12:34.154 --> 12:35.553
Probably from yer ma.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.789
[laughter]

12:37.791 --> 12:39.758
No, it's not from my ma.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.429
Fact is, it's from a girl
in this here class...

12:46.565 --> 12:50.201
But I'm too much of a gent
to kiss and tell.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.104
And the reason I don't
want to leave coal valley

12:53.106 --> 12:56.341
Is 'cause someday
I'm gonna marry her.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.042
[laughter]

12:59.245 --> 13:01.246
The end.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.580
Settle down.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.383
[applause]

13:05.385 --> 13:06.484
Thank you, gabe.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.287
Rachel, are you ready?

13:14.527 --> 13:16.828
Don't you need your workbook?

13:18.397 --> 13:19.898
No, ma'am.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.232
My story's in my heart.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.176
One day,

13:31.178 --> 13:33.444
Before my daddy
went to heaven,

13:33.446 --> 13:37.048
He gave me this little
piece of coal.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.285
He told to me
to think of it as a diamond.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.421
He called it
his "pearl of great price."

13:43.423 --> 13:46.024
I didn't know what that meant.

13:46.026 --> 13:50.161
I said, "it's just
a dumb ol' piece of coal."

13:52.598 --> 13:55.133
He said
it was a treasure,

13:55.135 --> 13:57.836
Just like our town's a treasure
for all who live here.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.239
And all treasures
worth digging for...

14:03.209 --> 14:06.144
Always come at a price.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.379
We all know that's true now,

14:08.381 --> 14:10.481
Don't we?

14:13.385 --> 14:16.087
Now that some of our mamas
are down in that mine,

14:16.089 --> 14:20.291
It makes me worried...

14:20.293 --> 14:23.561
What if something
happened to them

14:23.563 --> 14:25.363
That happened to
our fathers?

14:27.499 --> 14:28.633
You have every right

14:28.635 --> 14:31.336
To be afraid,

14:31.338 --> 14:32.904
You all do.

14:35.107 --> 14:36.507
But we mustn't lose hope.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.347
I believe there's a reason
for every fear we face,

14:42.349 --> 14:44.515
And every hardship
we suffer...

14:46.719 --> 14:49.888
That's to make us
all stronger people.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.760
[constable]: Mr. Gowen,
how can you justify

14:55.762 --> 14:57.428
Allowing those women
to walk into that mine?

14:57.430 --> 15:00.565
Believe me, it wasn't my idea.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.333
Those women go into that mine

15:02.335 --> 15:03.835
With their eyes
wide open.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.203
But you've prohibited
your men from lending a hand.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.638
Of course I did.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.339
My men are the only thing

15:08.341 --> 15:10.074
Standing between me

15:10.076 --> 15:13.077
And a complete shuttering
of that mine.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.245
Would you like
a drink?

15:15.781 --> 15:18.716
I'm not going to allow my men's
lives to be put in danger

15:18.718 --> 15:21.185
For of a bunch of
stubborn women.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.321
Who are trying
to save their homes.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.489
Constable, you do realize

15:24.491 --> 15:26.257
That as an officer of the law,

15:26.259 --> 15:28.092
That you cannot take a position
on a property dispute

15:28.094 --> 15:29.060
One way or the other.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.728
I am aware of the laws.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.330
And should the evictions
become necessary,

15:32.332 --> 15:34.365
That it will fall on you
to enforce them?

15:36.802 --> 15:38.536
Now, I've been
more than generous

15:38.538 --> 15:40.271
With these widows.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.440
I've allowed them to stay
in company housing

15:42.442 --> 15:44.342
Rent-free
since the mine disaster,

15:44.344 --> 15:45.510
When, clearly,

15:45.512 --> 15:47.812
According to the contract,

15:47.814 --> 15:50.081
I could have evicted them
much sooner.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.085
I'm sure you've done
everything you can

15:54.087 --> 15:55.286
To take care of them.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.487
I have.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.089
Just like you took
every precaution

15:58.091 --> 15:59.257
To protect their husbands.

16:02.494 --> 16:04.262
I'm sure you spared no expense

16:04.264 --> 16:06.331
When it came to the safety
of the men who work for you.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.504
Mr. Gowen.

16:22.414 --> 16:23.681
Good day, ned.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.682
Good day.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.184
Just wondering

16:26.186 --> 16:27.518
If there was
any wires for me yet.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.420
Oh, sorry.
No, constable.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.722
I'll let you know

16:30.724 --> 16:32.223
If anything from
your command post comes in.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.593
Oh, but you did get
another package in the mail.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.497
Pretty heavy.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.498
Is it a book maybe?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.799
Maybe.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.334
A little
light reading?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.736
Something like that.

16:46.638 --> 16:47.472
Thank you.

16:50.109 --> 16:53.344
I know you're between a rock
and a hard place, ladies,

16:53.346 --> 16:54.645
But you've got to
give it up.

16:54.647 --> 16:55.913
It just
ain't worth it.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.485
They're only doing
what we would do

17:00.487 --> 17:01.819
If we were
in their shoes.

17:12.264 --> 17:13.398
Let me help you
wash your hands, mama!

17:13.400 --> 17:14.732
[gasps]
sorry, baby.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.601
Mama's hands are just
a little banged up.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.902
Oh, mama.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.570
Some unkers salve

17:19.572 --> 17:21.172
And they'll be
just fine, baby.

17:25.177 --> 17:26.544
Miriam?

17:26.546 --> 17:28.146
Cynthia?

17:29.214 --> 17:31.082
Uh, take the pot inside.

17:32.184 --> 17:33.651
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.630
Thank you so much
for thinking of us.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.731
I asked my timothy
what he would think

17:46.733 --> 17:48.599
About me going
into the mine to help,

17:48.601 --> 17:50.234
But he forbade it.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.869
He said
it's too dangerous.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.405
The other wives
are getting the same

17:54.407 --> 17:55.740
From their husbands.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.741
Bringing you something
from our kitchens

17:56.743 --> 17:57.975
Feels so piddling,

17:57.977 --> 17:59.243
But we don't know
what more we can do.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.447
No, you're doing
the right thing,

18:02.449 --> 18:05.616
Not risking your safety
for your own kids' sake.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.984
But we will take

18:06.986 --> 18:09.520
All of the potluck
and prayer we can get.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.497
Oh!

18:19.499 --> 18:22.467
I made dinner.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.669
I found a recipe
for stew and biscuits.

18:26.472 --> 18:29.507
Oh, well, that's
very kind of you, elizabeth,

18:29.509 --> 18:31.909
But I think I would
fall asleep in my plate.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.612
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.546
Do my part.

18:36.949 --> 18:41.552
You are doing your part
by tending to the children.

18:43.422 --> 18:45.256
I suppose so.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.424
Besides,

18:46.426 --> 18:47.792
The children
of this town

18:47.794 --> 18:50.294
Need their teacher
more than ever right now.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.832
So let's not hear any more
about this, okay?

18:56.235 --> 18:57.835
[sighs wearily]

19:10.282 --> 19:12.817
[scoffs]

19:15.053 --> 19:16.954
You're just everywhere,
aren't you?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.823
It's my job to keep
an eye on things.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.324
Isn't there anything more
you could be doing

19:20.326 --> 19:22.760
Rather than just sitting around
looking all smug?

19:22.762 --> 19:23.995
My rules
and regulations require

19:23.997 --> 19:25.763
That I can't take sides
on this issue.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.598
At least

19:27.600 --> 19:29.400
Not until you have to enforce
mr. Gowen's evictions, right?

19:29.402 --> 19:30.835
If they become
necessary.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.537
Not because
I'd take any joy in it,

19:32.539 --> 19:34.038
But because the law
requires me to.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.806
Well, they won't
be necessary.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.575
How can you be so sure?

19:37.577 --> 19:39.577
These ladies,

19:39.579 --> 19:41.779
They've taken on
an impossible challenge.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.548
Just because they're women?

19:44.950 --> 19:46.083
Says the woman
who needed a man's help

19:46.085 --> 19:47.685
Lifting her crates
into the saloon.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.856
You think I'm weak.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.425
What I'm saying is,

19:54.427 --> 19:55.760
If there was ever a time

19:55.762 --> 19:57.094
For you to use
those big-city brains

19:57.096 --> 19:58.629
To look for another way
out of this mess,

19:58.631 --> 20:01.599
It's now.

20:14.646 --> 20:15.913
<i>[elizabeth writes]: I tried</i>

20:42.041 --> 20:45.910

20:45.912 --> 20:48.312
Big-city brains...

20:49.514 --> 20:52.583
I'm supposed to
think of a way out of this?

20:56.888 --> 20:58.489
Actually...

21:13.171 --> 21:14.272
Kind of late
for school, ain't it?

21:15.407 --> 21:17.475
Never too late for school.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.780
We're closed, miss thatcher.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.816
I'm not here to drink,
mr. Trevoy.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.511
[snoring]

22:40.926 --> 22:41.992

[heavy creaking overhead]

22:49.101 --> 22:50.835
[rumbling subsides]

22:50.837 --> 22:52.103
What was that?

22:54.573 --> 22:57.375
My noah used to call that
"the ghost in the attic."

22:57.377 --> 22:58.843
[chuckles nervously]

23:00.078 --> 23:01.712
It's okay.

23:07.886 --> 23:08.853
Hey, there,

23:08.855 --> 23:11.188
Little fella.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.890
Come on, chirp.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.059
Chirp for me.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.929
Gas...

23:18.931 --> 23:19.864
Gas!

23:19.866 --> 23:21.699
Everybody, get out!

23:21.701 --> 23:23.167
Hurry!

23:23.169 --> 23:24.034
Get out of the mine!

23:25.137 --> 23:27.204
Go! Hurry!

23:27.206 --> 23:28.139
Run!

23:51.763 --> 23:53.898
Is everyone all right?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.566
Did everyone
make it out?

23:55.568 --> 23:56.834
That's gonna need to be
stitched up, florence.

23:56.836 --> 23:57.835
I'm sorry.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.637
Mrs. Dort...

23:59.639 --> 24:01.639
[canary chirping]

24:01.641 --> 24:03.207
Did you even
check this bird

24:03.209 --> 24:06.210
Before screaming like a banshee
to get us out of that mine?

24:06.212 --> 24:08.813
I swear, that little creature
just sat there, starin' at me.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.881
I thought it was dead.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.316
It wasn't makin' a peep.

24:12.318 --> 24:14.218
Well, it's peeping now.

24:28.233 --> 24:30.801
[whispering]
what should we do?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.736
School's already started.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.572
She drools
like a horse.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.573
[all giggling]

24:35.575 --> 24:36.807
Maybe that's why

24:36.809 --> 24:37.908
The paper's
stuck to her head.

24:37.910 --> 24:38.909
Miss thatcher?

24:40.812 --> 24:42.546
Miss thatcher!

24:49.721 --> 24:51.222
[groggily] hi, rachel.

24:56.027 --> 24:57.027
Oh, my goodness!

24:57.029 --> 24:59.196
What time is it?

24:59.198 --> 25:00.231
Oh...

25:01.199 --> 25:02.299
Oh, dear children,

25:02.301 --> 25:04.001
I am...

25:04.003 --> 25:05.736
I...

25:05.738 --> 25:08.105
[stammers]
I-I was trying, but...

25:08.107 --> 25:10.007
Never mind, it just got
very late, and I must have--

25:10.009 --> 25:11.642
You definitely did.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.943
[laughter]

25:16.281 --> 25:17.982
Oh, my.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.416
What's our first
assignment

25:19.418 --> 25:20.784
For the day,
miss thatcher?

25:20.786 --> 25:21.886
Math?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.420
Yes.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.656
"use the kids
to help with the research."

25:30.896 --> 25:33.864
No, actually.

25:33.866 --> 25:37.101
I want each of you to grab
a research manual

25:37.103 --> 25:38.402
Or encyclopedia
from the bookshelf

25:38.404 --> 25:39.770
And bring it
back to your tables.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.972
Why, miss thatcher?

25:41.974 --> 25:43.207
We're going to
try to find a way

25:43.209 --> 25:45.042
To help the mothers
in the mine.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.343
With books?

25:46.345 --> 25:49.847
Yes! Books can be
very powerful weapons.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.715
We're going to do a word search.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.017
When you get your book,

25:53.019 --> 25:54.351
I want you to go through it
page by page,

25:54.353 --> 25:56.654
Looking for these words...

25:56.656 --> 25:59.156
"home,"

25:59.158 --> 26:01.725
"house,"

26:01.727 --> 26:04.428
Or "property."

26:04.430 --> 26:05.362
Seems kind of
boring.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.797
Pipe down, james.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.265
If it keeps us
off math, who cares?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.500
Yes, james.

26:09.502 --> 26:11.268
Nobody cares
about math right now.

26:13.138 --> 26:14.038
[sighs]

26:21.913 --> 26:23.447
More coffee?

26:23.449 --> 26:24.615
Please.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.658
Leave it?

26:39.130 --> 26:40.364
Thank you.

26:57.148 --> 26:58.949
"...The domain act--

26:58.951 --> 27:00.918
Home improvements
like painting..."

27:04.990 --> 27:06.323
[chuckles]

27:08.193 --> 27:10.794
[laughing in triumph]

27:12.797 --> 27:15.866
Thank you, old farmer,

27:15.868 --> 27:18.268
Whoever you are.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.670
[giggles]

27:24.275 --> 27:26.377
Afternoon,
miss thatcher.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.479
Now, if you've come
for pencils and paper,

27:28.481 --> 27:30.247
I have them
on back order.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.515
No, mr. Yost.

27:31.517 --> 27:32.850
I'm here for paint
and paintbrushes.

27:32.852 --> 27:33.851
Oh, certainly.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.119
What's it for,
a class project?

27:35.121 --> 27:37.421
You might say that.

27:39.524 --> 27:42.860
All right, well,
what color do you need?

27:42.862 --> 27:44.128
Every color that you have.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.830
Pardon me?

27:46.832 --> 27:47.865
I'd like to buy up
all the paint

27:47.867 --> 27:48.832
That you have in stock,

27:48.834 --> 27:49.967
Plus all the brushes

27:49.969 --> 27:52.036
And other
painting supplies.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.370
Are you sure, ma'am?

27:53.372 --> 27:55.205
That'll all cost you
a pretty penny.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.141
Well, as you can see...

27:58.410 --> 28:00.177
I have a lot of pennies.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.414
Looks like you want to
paint the whole town.

28:03.416 --> 28:06.650
Not the whole town exactly.

28:06.652 --> 28:07.918
And I need it all delivered
to the row houses

28:07.920 --> 28:09.053
By 8:00 tomorrow morning.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.355
Certainly, uh...

28:11.357 --> 28:13.057
Why don't you follow me,

28:13.059 --> 28:15.859
And we can see how much
this will set you back.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.261
Right this way.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.297
Then the company doctor said

28:20.299 --> 28:21.532
Suzanne lowry cut a muscle
in her leg

28:21.534 --> 28:24.201
With that pick axe.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.169
She could be hobbled
for a while.

28:25.171 --> 28:28.038
Kate frazier
broke her arm,

28:28.040 --> 28:32.376
Nancy sanders got a concussion
and a nasty gash in her head.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.445
That makes seven of us
too injured

28:34.447 --> 28:36.513
To go back in.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.416
I should've been
more grateful for my paul.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.952
He was
a good provider.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.321
Well, he might have been
a first-rate miner,

28:44.323 --> 28:46.023
But I'll bet

28:46.025 --> 28:47.791
He wouldn't have had a chance
changing a diaper.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.227
[laughs] no.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.029
I guess
he wouldn't have.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.865
Hats off to you ladies
for stickin' with it.

28:56.835 --> 28:58.435
You've got guts.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.270
Truly.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.638
For what it's worth,

29:01.640 --> 29:03.407
I thought you were
all crazy at first,

29:03.409 --> 29:05.309
But now I hope
you give mr. Gowen

29:05.311 --> 29:06.977
A run for his money.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.011
Thanks, fellas.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.246
That means a lot.

29:15.386 --> 29:16.487
Hello!

29:16.489 --> 29:19.189
Hello, everyone.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.125
Hello.

29:21.127 --> 29:22.192
Elizabeth, what
are you doing here?

29:22.194 --> 29:24.027
At that first meeting,

29:24.029 --> 29:25.529
You told me to keep thinking
about this eviction problem,

29:25.531 --> 29:26.864
So I did.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.165
Actually,

29:28.167 --> 29:29.600
Your children
and I did.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.335
Well, we're all ears,
miss thatcher.

29:31.337 --> 29:34.138
How do you feel about
painting your houses?

29:36.407 --> 29:38.242
[chuckles]

29:40.011 --> 29:41.512
Ladies,

29:41.514 --> 29:43.480
Perhaps while we're waiting
for mr. Yost to arrive,

29:43.482 --> 29:45.516
We could divide up
into groups

29:45.518 --> 29:47.084
So we could move from
one house to the next?

29:47.086 --> 29:49.419
What's mr. Gowen doing here?

29:57.328 --> 29:58.395
Good morning,
ladies.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.063
Miss thatcher,

30:00.065 --> 30:01.231
I brought the paint

30:01.233 --> 30:03.400
That you ordered
from the mercantile.

30:09.107 --> 30:12.042
Wait, that can't be
all of it.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.443
I bought up all the paint
in the store.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.212
Mr. Yost forgot

30:15.214 --> 30:17.047
That most of his supply
had already been spoken for.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.316
By whom?

30:19.318 --> 30:20.450
By me.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.386
The company needs the paint.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.453
Needs it for what?

30:23.455 --> 30:24.688
Maintenance.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.391
The mine will be
reopening soon.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.426
The buildings
need a fresh coat.

30:33.932 --> 30:36.133
Your refund,

30:36.135 --> 30:38.268
Miss thatcher.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.411
I should say

30:47.413 --> 30:49.546
That if it's the domain act
that you were trying to invoke,

30:49.548 --> 30:51.515
That is not unknown
to the company.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.017
We've had to
fend it off before.

30:54.019 --> 30:57.321
But for what it's worth...

30:57.323 --> 31:00.190
Well, I applaud your ingenuity.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.326
I do.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.560
It would have been
a brilliant way

31:03.562 --> 31:05.429
To block the evictions.

31:08.399 --> 31:10.100
Ladies,

31:10.102 --> 31:11.268
I admire your pluck.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.537
You do
your families proud.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.239
Unfortunately

31:15.241 --> 31:17.040
I cannot change
the terms of our agreement.

31:18.443 --> 31:19.710
That shaft
must be cleared

31:19.712 --> 31:22.646
In order for you
to stay in your homes.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.681
And the timetable

31:24.683 --> 31:26.450
Still stands.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.418
Mr. Spurlock?

31:30.588 --> 31:32.289
[cranks motor,
engine roars to life]

31:42.700 --> 31:45.035
Now we'll be late
for our shift.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.295
Oh, my lord.

32:16.467 --> 32:18.235
What happened?

32:18.237 --> 32:19.369
Roof pins in the
timbers didn't hold.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.405
[sighing]

32:21.407 --> 32:22.406
All that work.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.807
You did this.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.208
Didn't you?

32:25.210 --> 32:26.143
What? No!

32:26.145 --> 32:28.145
Gowen had you sabotage us!

32:28.147 --> 32:29.446
This is the company's doing.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.514
They're making it
impossible for us

32:30.516 --> 32:32.783
To keep our houses!

32:32.785 --> 32:34.184
Florence...

32:34.186 --> 32:36.420
[crying] they're
all against us!

32:36.422 --> 32:37.387
Florence.

32:37.389 --> 32:40.791
[sobbing]

32:40.793 --> 32:43.393
I can't...

32:43.395 --> 32:44.661
I can't do this no more.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.163
We can start over.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.131
We can do this
and still save our homes.

32:48.133 --> 32:51.468
How? We've lost a whole week.
We're back to where we started.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.237
You just--
you've got to have faith,

32:54.239 --> 32:55.505
And we have to
stick together.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.174
Yes.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.176
Mr. Gowen, he was right.

32:59.178 --> 33:02.145
This is a joke.

33:03.448 --> 33:07.551
There's no such thing
as lady miners.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.119
Florence...

33:09.121 --> 33:11.455
We never should've
tried this.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.190
My little rosaleen's

33:13.192 --> 33:16.226
Already suffered enough
from the loss of her daddy.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.595
I should've just
accepted our fate

33:18.597 --> 33:21.064
And not burned up
what little time we got left.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.238
[sighs]

33:28.240 --> 33:31.274
Ladies,

33:31.276 --> 33:33.143
I beg of you, go home

33:33.145 --> 33:36.146
And use what little time
you have left

33:36.148 --> 33:38.148
To say a proper goodbye.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.239
[canary warbles and sings]

34:05.309 --> 34:07.544
[clock chimes]

34:07.546 --> 34:09.112
It's reading hour,
miss thatcher.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.250
Miss thatcher?

34:16.354 --> 34:17.587
What's that?

34:17.589 --> 34:19.523
It's supposed to be
reading hour.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.658
[sighs] sorry.

34:21.660 --> 34:24.227
Right.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.438
Are you okay, miss thatcher?

34:34.440 --> 34:37.307
I'm fine, rachel.
Thank you.

34:37.309 --> 34:41.311
When my mama came home
from the mine yesterday,

34:41.313 --> 34:44.414
She said we have to leave
coal valley.

34:47.251 --> 34:50.253
I want you to have this.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.156
I hope it helps you

34:53.158 --> 34:55.459
Love this place as much as I do.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.316
Boys and girls,
you may collect your things.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.651
Until
further notice,

35:21.653 --> 35:23.620
School is out.

35:28.359 --> 35:30.393
I'm just saying,
this isn't the best idea.

35:30.395 --> 35:31.628
I don't have a choice.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.430
My first plan failed.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.331
I know.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.299
Look, I live here now.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.201
This is my community,

35:38.203 --> 35:39.503
And the children I teach

35:39.505 --> 35:41.371
Are terrified
about losing their homes.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.506
I have to do something.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.207
Elizabeth,
it is too dangerous.

35:44.209 --> 35:45.308
Because I'm a woman?

35:45.310 --> 35:46.376
Because right now

35:46.378 --> 35:48.712
That mine is filled with women.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.046
Yes, I know,

35:50.048 --> 35:52.449
And I wish I could stop
all of them.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.383
Legally, I can't.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.620
You can't stop me either.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.557
My son, bradley, said

36:00.559 --> 36:01.558
School's being canceled
until further notice.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.592
Is that true?

36:02.594 --> 36:03.894
Yes.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.595
I want to help the lady miners.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.697
Well, you're being paid
to teach, not digging coal.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.699
I realize that, but--

36:09.701 --> 36:11.234
So you need to go
back to school

36:11.236 --> 36:12.369
And do your job.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.436
I'm sorry

36:13.438 --> 36:14.771
You feel that way,
mrs. Ramsey,

36:14.773 --> 36:16.373
But mr. Gowen has
given these widows

36:16.375 --> 36:18.375
Until tomorrow--

36:18.377 --> 36:19.476
I don't think
it's your place

36:19.478 --> 36:20.477
To go into the mine--

36:20.479 --> 36:21.444
Ladies,

36:21.446 --> 36:22.746
It seems to me

36:22.748 --> 36:23.580
If she's willing to put
her community

36:23.582 --> 36:24.648
Before her own safety,

36:24.650 --> 36:25.715
That's something
to be commended.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.350
Now, as risky as it is,

36:27.352 --> 36:29.386
Some of the women
in this town

36:29.388 --> 36:30.854
Are standing together
to save their homes.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.455
Now, I'd think the other mothers
would understand that,

36:32.457 --> 36:34.457
Since most of them
are married to men

36:34.459 --> 36:35.559
Who walk into that mine

36:35.561 --> 36:36.960
Every day.

36:36.962 --> 36:38.428
There but for the grace of god
go all of you.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.000
I wish you weren't
doing this.

36:44.002 --> 36:47.637
I understand why you are,
but just, be careful.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.639
Thank you.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.244
[♪]

37:10.828 --> 37:12.495
[grunting with effort]

37:12.497 --> 37:14.631
Oof!

37:14.633 --> 37:15.465
[gasps]

37:17.301 --> 37:20.737
What in the world?

37:20.739 --> 37:24.507
I know I'm the last person
you expected to see here.

37:24.509 --> 37:25.842
Actually, I think the truer
statement is,

37:25.844 --> 37:28.878
You're the last person
you expected to see here.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.480
Maybe so.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.949
But I'm here anyway.

37:32.951 --> 37:33.950
Hand me
a chock and mallet.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.552
Got it, right here.

37:36.621 --> 37:38.688
Florence, you're back!

37:38.690 --> 37:40.357
Well, if little miss princess
here can give it her best,

37:40.359 --> 37:41.491
So can the rest of us.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.427
What do you mean,
"the rest of us?"

37:59.710 --> 38:01.544
Oh, boy.

38:01.546 --> 38:05.382
This is not
gonna make someone happy.

38:07.551 --> 38:08.485
Sir.

38:09.553 --> 38:10.787
I'm not sure
how to say this,

38:10.789 --> 38:13.490
But all the women
are goin' into the mine.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.458
You mean all the widows.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.861
No. All the women.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.563
What do you mean,
when you say "all the women?"

38:20.565 --> 38:21.598
All the women,

38:21.600 --> 38:23.099
In the entire town,

38:23.101 --> 38:25.502
And they're planning on working
around-the-clock shifts.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.014
<i>On my journey west,</i>

38:38.016 --> 38:39.516
<i>He told me he hoped</i>

38:39.518 --> 38:40.917
<i>What god had shaped me for,</i>

38:40.919 --> 38:42.452
<i>And then give</i>

38:50.995 --> 38:52.495
<i>I thought I already knew</i>
<i>what that was.</i>

38:52.497 --> 38:54.631
<i>As a teacher,</i>

38:54.633 --> 38:56.099
<i>I would be a molder</i>

38:56.101 --> 38:59.636
<i>And an encouragement</i>

39:03.941 --> 39:06.743
<i>But in trying to give</i>

39:06.745 --> 39:09.579
<i>I've learned it's much more</i>

39:19.957 --> 39:23.159
<i>One sometimes has to go</i>

39:23.161 --> 39:25.662
<i>To dig deep into</i>

39:25.664 --> 39:29.466
[everyone cheering
and applauding]

39:49.053 --> 39:51.755
<i>One has to be willing</i>
<i>to lose everything</i>

39:51.757 --> 39:54.657
<i>In order to gain</i>
<i>what god has shaped them for.</i>

39:59.830 --> 40:01.631
<i>Because there's a cost</i>
<i>to the things</i>

40:01.633 --> 40:03.566
<i>That matter most in life,</i>

40:03.568 --> 40:05.135
<i>And it's in that sacrifice</i>

40:05.137 --> 40:09.973
<i>That we find</i>
<i>our true treasure.</i>

40:24.655 --> 40:26.556
I never
got to thank you

40:26.558 --> 40:28.558
For leaving me
that note in the saloon.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.026
You're welcome.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.795
I figured it was
the least I could do.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.696
Was it really
necessary

40:33.698 --> 40:34.998
To leave it
on my forehead?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.065
You were snoring.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.600
I didn't want
to wake you.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.468
Please.
I do not snore.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.703
Ladies do not snore.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.405
You're right.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.842
So...

40:45.844 --> 40:47.610
Have you been writing
in that journal?

40:47.612 --> 40:51.481
Of course.
That's what it's for.

40:51.483 --> 40:53.082
Well, anything
about me in there?

40:53.084 --> 40:56.519
That would be why
it's a private journal.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.521
Well, I hope
it's not all bad.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.957
You were the one
who told me to write

41:00.959 --> 41:03.993
That you were forced here
by my father to babysit me.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.062
Which is all true,

41:06.064 --> 41:09.065
But maybe "forced"
is slightly too harsh.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.668
Does "compelled" cover it?

41:11.670 --> 41:13.536
Still not quite right.

41:13.538 --> 41:15.271
"manipulated?"

41:15.273 --> 41:18.007
That's getting closer.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.409
It was a big blow for me

41:19.411 --> 41:21.644
Not to get my posting
in cape fullerton.

41:21.646 --> 41:22.712
Chasing pirates
and whiskey-runners.

41:22.714 --> 41:24.647
Yeah.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.916
I was really
looking forward to that.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.652
A darn shame.
