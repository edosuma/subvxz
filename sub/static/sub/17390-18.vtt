WEBVTT

00:03.070 --> 00:04.236
Oh, no.

00:04.238 --> 00:06.238
DON:
What happened?

00:06.240 --> 00:08.507
You finally get that picture
of me licking your toothbrush?

00:10.211 --> 00:11.744
What? No, no.

00:11.746 --> 00:13.479
Oh, forget I said anything.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.181
We just got the tickets
Andi ordered

00:16.183 --> 00:18.283
for all of us to go to
<i> Lord of the Dance.</i>

00:18.285 --> 00:20.019
(sighs)

00:20.021 --> 00:22.187
Why did we agree to go to that?

00:22.189 --> 00:23.756
Well, it was just easier
to say yes.

00:23.758 --> 00:26.792
Why ruin that day when this day
seemed so far away?

00:26.794 --> 00:29.495
Well, I say treat those tickets
like a jury summons

00:29.497 --> 00:31.263
and throw them in the trash.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.267
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.336
Whoa, what did Mommy say
about playing ball in the house?

00:37.338 --> 00:39.671
I don't know.

00:39.673 --> 00:42.574
Well, what do you
think she said?

00:42.576 --> 00:44.710
Well, if you know,
can you just tell us?

00:47.281 --> 00:49.214
Emme?

00:49.216 --> 00:50.282
No ball in the house.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.683
That's right.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.253
And that little girl
gets a butterscotch.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.456
That's how
you do that.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.431
Hey, check it out.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.799
Into the laundry
basket from downtown.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.769
(vase shatters)
Oh, no!

01:10.771 --> 01:12.571
No, Andi got that
from her grandma.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.373
She's gonna kill me.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.110
Here's what you do: you just
break everything in the room.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.778
She won't know what
to get mad about first.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.848
Quick, help me clean this up
before she gets home.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.352
Hey, honey, how was your d...

01:30.157 --> 01:32.324
What did you do to my vase?

01:32.326 --> 01:34.159
Well, it-it was an accident.

01:34.161 --> 01:35.294
An accident?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.262
Adam, I got this
from my grandmother.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.764
It's irreplaceable.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.699
I mean, technically,
I could buy it again,

01:40.701 --> 01:42.801
but it wouldn't be from her!

01:42.803 --> 01:45.804
Actually, it wasn't him,
it was me.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.441
Oh.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.642
Well...

01:50.644 --> 01:52.711
accidents happen.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.254
Did you see that?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.356
Something she would've been
upset about all afternoon

02:04.358 --> 02:06.325
is just... over.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.426
Thanks, man.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.863
It's the least I could do.

02:10.865 --> 02:13.132
I really put your toothbrush
through a lot.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.237
Hey, w-what
did you want?

02:18.239 --> 02:19.705
Why did I have to
rush over here?

02:19.707 --> 02:21.640
It's your turn to take
the blame with Marcy.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.343
For what?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.712
MARCY: Don, what did
you do to the toilet?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.683
Oh, no.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.352
Of all the weird
things you've done,

02:33.354 --> 02:34.653
this has to be
the weirdest.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.324
Uh, it wasn't him,
it was me.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.495
Oh. Why would you have
a sandwich in the bathroom?

02:50.871 --> 02:53.205
That is a
great question.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.741
Uh, I guess

02:55.743 --> 02:59.578
it's because I'm
a disgusting pig.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.481
And why would you try to
flush it down the toilet?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.557
He probably just wanted
to see if it would work.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.497
Hard to believe
that was me.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.701
Okay. Well, just don't eat
in my bathroom anymore.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.570
Oh.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.371
Ugh.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.439
Did you see that?

03:27.441 --> 03:28.840
She just walked away.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.475
Yeah.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.611
Yeah, the blame thing
worked again.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.514
Even on Marcy.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.516
This feels like a dream.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.851
But it can't be because
I'm not naked.

03:39.853 --> 03:43.255
Oh, no, this is very
real, my friend.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.324
You know what we just did?

03:45.326 --> 03:46.925
We just solved marriage!

03:49.697 --> 03:52.397
I can't believe
that just happened.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.466
I feel giddy.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.236
Yeah, it's nice to leave
the house without Marcy saying,

03:57.238 --> 03:58.570
"Get out of the house."

03:59.840 --> 04:02.307
You know what?

04:02.309 --> 04:05.811
I think it worked because
I don't have baggage with Marcy

04:05.813 --> 04:07.779
a-and you don't have
baggage with Andi.

04:07.781 --> 04:08.947
See, when our wives

04:08.949 --> 04:10.549
get mad at us,

04:10.551 --> 04:13.452
it isn't only about
what we just did,

04:13.454 --> 04:16.555
it's also about all the
screw-ups that came before.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.591
That's heavy, man.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.559
Yeah.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.794
Yeah, when I mess up
big-time,

04:22.796 --> 04:27.566
Andi always brings up
the delivery room hot dog.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.869
They had hot dogs in
your delivery room?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.506
You must have great insurance.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.775
No, no, no.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.444
I never told you this story?
Mm-mm.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.546
When Andi was in labor
with Katie, right,

04:41.548 --> 04:43.482
it was taking a long time.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.350
And from the delivery
room window,

04:45.352 --> 04:47.486
I could see a hot dog cart
on the street.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.388
Mm.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.523
I was starving; I knew,
once that baby's born,

04:51.525 --> 04:53.558
no hot dog for Adam.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.828
So I said I had to go
to the bathroom

04:56.830 --> 04:58.363
and I ran down there, right?

04:58.365 --> 04:59.765
Then my phone rings,
it's the nurse,

04:59.767 --> 05:02.000
"The baby's coming,
the baby's coming."

05:02.002 --> 05:04.803
And here's where I make
a terrible mistake.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.708
I didn't throw away the hot dog.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.845
(exhales)

05:13.847 --> 05:16.348
You should've just flushed
that thing down the toilet.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.520
And then Andi hands Katie
to me and says,

05:21.522 --> 05:22.954
"Would you like to hold
our daughter?"

05:22.956 --> 05:25.490
And I say,
"Sure, hold my hot dog."

05:27.394 --> 05:29.628
That's the kind of thing
a wife hangs onto.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.696
Yeah.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.598
Yeah, I see what
you're saying.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.901
You know, Marcy still brings up
the time at our wedding

05:35.903 --> 05:37.669
when they said,
"Kiss the bride,"

05:37.671 --> 05:40.706
and, for laughs, I turned
and kissed the priest.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.976
Yeah, that was
a swing and a miss.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.645
Yeah.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.946
But-but this blaming
each other is like

05:47.948 --> 05:49.715
a Get Out of Jail Free card.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.551
(chuckles): I know.
We unlocked a great power here.

05:52.553 --> 05:56.788
Yeah, yeah. But, hey, but we got
to use it wisely and sparingly.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.724
Oh. Yeah.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.828
Well, I'm not
doing that.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.963
Me neither.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.599
¶ ¶

06:15.676 --> 06:18.944
Don, you ruined our guest
towels with your greasy hands!

06:18.946 --> 06:21.046
Why are you always so careless?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.748
Wait, honey, Adam did it.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.618
Oh.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.689
Adam, what happened
to all the cookies

06:30.691 --> 06:32.457
that I made for
Emme's class?

06:32.459 --> 06:34.126
And keep in mind,
when I ask that question,

06:34.128 --> 06:35.827
I already know the answer.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.430
Don ate them.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.499
Oh.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.106
I'm telling you, this
blame game is the best thing

06:48.108 --> 06:49.741
that ever happened to us.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.176
Yeah, it's good,

06:51.178 --> 06:54.079
but don't you feel
a little guilty?

06:54.081 --> 06:56.848
Guilt is how I know I'm alive.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.085
Hey, babe.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.486
Check it out.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.422
I got your favorite ice cream.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.723
Oh, look,

07:04.725 --> 07:06.124
Don's here.

07:07.694 --> 07:11.630
Anything broken or eaten
or otherwise screwed up?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.665
(chuckles) Not today.
He kept an eye on me.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.200
But I better
get out of here

07:15.202 --> 07:17.803
before I screw
something else up.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.638
Don!

07:20.741 --> 07:22.040
That's our ice cream.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.909
Oh, sorry, there I go again.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.450
Man, I do not envy Marcy.
(scoffs)

07:33.086 --> 07:36.087
You know, sometimes it
takes a Don in your life

07:36.089 --> 07:39.157
to realize how lucky you
are with your own husband.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.159
(nervous chuckle)

07:41.161 --> 07:43.595
What's all this about?

07:45.532 --> 07:47.499
I don't know, I just...

07:47.501 --> 07:50.535
I feel bad for always accusing
you of things you didn't do.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.003
So...

07:52.005 --> 07:53.672
I wanted to apologize.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.475
Oh, you don't
have to apologize to me.

07:56.477 --> 07:59.578
You really, really don't.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.779
No, I do.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.247
I mean, come on,

08:02.249 --> 08:04.816
you're not a cookie thief
or a vase breaker.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.485
That's not the man I married.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.857
(chuckles):
Yeah.

08:11.859 --> 08:15.193
You know what I'm gonna do
for you because I'm sorry?

08:15.195 --> 08:18.997
I am gonna give you
a foot massage.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.968
Oh, I-I don't think it has
to be an apology foot massage.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.503
Can't you just

08:24.505 --> 08:27.539
do it for the love of
rubbing my feet?

08:27.541 --> 08:31.042
Great husbands get great things.
Come on.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.612
Uh, just out
of curiosity,

08:33.614 --> 08:35.680
what do bad husbands get?

08:35.682 --> 08:38.950
Oh, you don't want to know.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.857
Oh, hey, Lowell.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.225
What are you doing here?

08:47.227 --> 08:48.827
I wanted to give you these

08:48.829 --> 08:51.563
all access passes
to the car show this weekend.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.031
(Lowell chuckles)

08:53.033 --> 08:55.534
Lowell, this
is incredible!

08:55.536 --> 08:58.670
I've never had
all access to anything.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.573
I don't even have
all access to Marcy.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.577
Don, we can't go to
the car show;

09:05.579 --> 09:08.079
it's the same day as
<i> Lord of the Dance.</i>

09:08.081 --> 09:11.583
That is the saddest thing
I've ever said in my life.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.285
Come on, we'll just find a way
to use the blame thing

09:13.287 --> 09:15.504
to get out of
<i> Lord of the Dance.</i>

09:15.505 --> 09:17.722
Yeah, Don was telling me
what you guys have been up to.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.992
It sounds, well, appalling.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.127
ADAM:
No, no,

09:22.129 --> 09:23.662
you're right.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.330
Last night,
Andi gave me

09:25.332 --> 09:27.265
a foot massage
under false pretenses.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.602
I had to "ooh" and "ah"
and pretend I was into it.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.604
I faked it.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.307
Look, there's no other way
to avoid getting our wives mad.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.809
Well, I have a thought: you
could just not do the things

09:37.811 --> 09:39.144
that make them mad.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.912
(chuckles)

09:40.914 --> 09:42.581
We're trying to have
a real conversation here

09:42.583 --> 09:44.182
about real stuff,
if you don't mind.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.752
Look, maybe we should just
lay off the blame thing.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.753
Oh, come on.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.355
One more, for the car show.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.924
One last big job,
and then we'll go straight.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.359
I don't know.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.628
I read in the paper
they got the Trans Am

09:56.630 --> 09:58.630
from<i> Smokey</i>
<i>and the Bandit.</i>

09:58.632 --> 10:01.600
You could take a picture next
to cardboard Burt Reynolds.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.638
Well, I don't want to miss that.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.007
Okay, all right,
one last job.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.875
Or you could do something
nice for your wives

10:10.877 --> 10:13.211
and give up one afternoon
for their sake.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.350
Lowell, I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.887
MARCY:
<i> I can't believe</i>

10:22.889 --> 10:25.156
that the boys have to miss<i> Lord</i>
<i>of the Dance</i> this afternoon.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.959
Why would Adam schedule
a meeting on a Saturday?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.294
Where'd you hear that?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.079
From Don.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.863
Well, Adam said the
reason they couldn't go

10:32.866 --> 10:34.399
is 'cause Don messed
up a client's floors

10:34.401 --> 10:35.367
and they had to fix them.

10:35.369 --> 10:36.901
That's what he told you?

10:36.903 --> 10:40.271
Yeah, but why would
they blame each other?

10:47.381 --> 10:49.347
Let me just
ask you something.

10:49.349 --> 10:53.885
Has Adam ever tried to flush
a sandwich down the toilet?

10:54.855 --> 10:57.055
No.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.259
What have they done?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.129
DON:
Okay.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.664
We're all set for the car show.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.265
I blamed you and I told Marcy

11:07.267 --> 11:08.900
you scheduled a meeting
for this afternoon.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.168
We're free, baby.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.903
What?

11:11.905 --> 11:13.672
I blamed you

11:13.674 --> 11:15.373
and told Andi you wrecked
a client's floors.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.375
They'll tell each other
and we'll get busted.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.878
You think they'll talk?

11:30.090 --> 11:32.457
I think they talked.

11:33.760 --> 11:37.062
Wait, let's see
how this plays out.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.170
So, you two have just been

11:45.172 --> 11:47.372
blaming each other
to get out of stuff?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.407
Well, how long has
this been going on?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.710
Well...
Oh, I got this.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.978
What's the earliest one
you know about?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.719
MARCY:
Don, I think we need

12:00.721 --> 12:03.488
to finish this at home, 'cause I
can't use all my special words;

12:03.490 --> 12:06.925
there's children upstairs.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.360
Cheer up. We had a good run.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.429
(door closes)

12:15.368 --> 12:18.036
(chuckles)
That guy, huh?

12:19.272 --> 12:23.208
Sometimes it takes a Don in your
life to make you appreciate...

12:23.210 --> 12:24.509
Nope.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.013
Would you like a foot rub?

12:29.015 --> 12:30.815
I would not, no.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.818
Okay. Here's what it is.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.020
Yes, we blamed each other,

12:36.022 --> 12:39.290
but it's actually
kind of your fault.

12:39.292 --> 12:43.194
Okay, i-if this
i-is your apology,

12:43.196 --> 12:45.964
I'm gonna have to give it a...
(blows raspberries)

12:45.966 --> 12:48.933
Look, when I screw
something up,

12:48.935 --> 12:52.003
you get madder at me
than you would at someone else,

12:52.005 --> 12:53.938
because I'm also
catching the heat

12:53.940 --> 12:57.542
from the baggage of everything
I've ever done before.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.478
This is seriously
what you're going with?

13:00.480 --> 13:03.848
Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.851
Okay, when you thought
I broke that vase,

13:06.853 --> 13:08.153
what popped into your head?

13:08.155 --> 13:09.420
How careless you were.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.855
Which made you think...?

13:10.857 --> 13:12.791
How sometimes
you don't stop and think

13:12.793 --> 13:14.292
about how what you do
affects me.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.393
Which reminded you of...?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.028
The delivery room hot dog.

13:17.030 --> 13:17.929
Aha!

13:20.834 --> 13:22.500
"Aha" what?

13:22.502 --> 13:24.035
See, it always goes there

13:24.037 --> 13:26.037
'cause it's always
in the back of your mind.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.273
Okay.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.009
I-I can kind of
see that, I guess.

13:31.011 --> 13:34.012
Right? I-It makes sense, right?

13:34.014 --> 13:38.883
I have to admit that is pretty
perceptive and insightful.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.885
And it can help us.

13:40.887 --> 13:43.888
Okay, because now that
you're aware that you've been

13:43.890 --> 13:46.124
hanging onto that
dumb, old hot dog,

13:46.126 --> 13:49.194
you can just
let it go. Right?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.598
You know what? No.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.035
What?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.837
You remember when I was
perceptive and insightful?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.872
I was right over here.

14:02.475 --> 14:06.511
Well, yeah, you figured it out,
but the baggage is still there.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.812
I mean,

14:07.813 --> 14:09.112
when they figured out gravity,

14:09.115 --> 14:11.115
it didn't just stop
affecting people.

14:11.117 --> 14:14.018
I mean, we're not just all
floating around in space.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.021
(chuckles): Okay, well,
it wouldn't go like that

14:17.023 --> 14:18.122
for starters.
Oh.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.190
It wouldn't?
(chuckles)

14:19.192 --> 14:21.059
Oh, okay, I have
a better example.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.895
Let's just say there's
a jackass in front of me, okay?
Uh-huh.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.065
And I call him a jackass...
Right.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.334
...he doesn't just
disappear, did you?
(chuckles)

14:33.907 --> 14:36.241
I think you just
called me a jackass.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.911
You snuck it in,
but I heard it.

14:39.913 --> 14:43.114
You let me give you a foot rub.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.083
Yeah, but I
didn't enjoy it.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.019
Okay. Okay, you know what?

14:48.021 --> 14:49.554
You go to your car show.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.056
Okay? I am gonna go

14:51.057 --> 14:52.557
to<i> Lord of the Dance</i> with Marcy.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.226
You don't deserve
to watch wild Irishmen

14:55.228 --> 14:57.228
tap-dance their way
into your heart!

14:57.230 --> 14:59.998
Great. I will go
to the car show.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.299
And while I'm there,
I'll have a hot dog,

15:01.301 --> 15:02.500
and I hope somebody has a baby

15:02.502 --> 15:04.235
in front of me
while I'm eating it.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.008
Okay, so this is a car show.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.044
What do we do?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.013
We look at cars.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.214
That's it?

15:16.216 --> 15:19.183
You know what, guys,

15:19.185 --> 15:20.385
I'm not having fun.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.654
Oh, thank God,
someone said it.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.689
No, it's this thing with Andi.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.125
I'm right, but I still feel bad.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.027
Interesting.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.962
Let's unpack those emotions.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.297
And I'm out.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.568
I think you're feeling bad
because even though

15:37.570 --> 15:41.439
you were technically right,
you did lie to her, and also,

15:41.441 --> 15:43.141
I don't think you were right.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.243
But I am right.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.978
A-And what about the baggage?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.179
She has baggage.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.214
That you gave to her.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.116
You know what,
I'm gonna to go talk to Andi.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.701
I can't believe after all this,

15:53.702 --> 15:55.285
I'm still gonna end up
at<i> Lord of the Dance.</i>

15:58.124 --> 16:00.091
I got to tell you,
I'm not feeling great

16:00.093 --> 16:02.160
about the boys getting out
of<i> Lord of the Dance.</i>

16:02.162 --> 16:04.329
Well, they don't want to
go, what are you gonna do?

16:04.331 --> 16:07.031
Make them do it.
That's what a marriage is.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.701
No, this whole thing
with Adam, I just...

16:09.703 --> 16:12.537
I don't like the way
I feel right now.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.073
And seeing all these
miserable husbands

16:15.075 --> 16:19.978
watching sports on their
phones reminds me of him.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.980
Well, go talk to him.
I'll be fine.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.147
Maybe I'll sneak backstage

16:23.149 --> 16:26.050
and see if I can towel off
a sweaty Irishman.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.688
(whispering):
Andi.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.726
Andi, where are you?

16:34.728 --> 16:36.227
MARCY (whispering):
Adam.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.396
Over here.
Oh.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.098
(whispering):
Excuse me. Yeah.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.265
Hi. Excuse me.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.400
Excuse me, excuse me.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.168
Excuse me. Thank you.
Hi, how are you?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.237
Excuse me, excuse me.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.538
Where's Andi?

16:47.540 --> 16:50.008
She's on her way
to the car show to find you.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.175
Shh!

16:51.177 --> 16:52.243
Oh, do not shush me.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.644
We have three
long hours together.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.313
You don't want
to start like this.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.284
Excuse me, excuse me.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.487
Excuse me,
excuse me.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.256
Oh, boy.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.091
Excuse me!

17:07.093 --> 17:09.694
Has anyone seen a middle-aged
man in a flannel shirt?

17:13.333 --> 17:16.300
Wow, I have got
to take him shopping.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.810
Hey.

17:25.812 --> 17:29.147
Hey. How was the car show?

17:29.149 --> 17:31.115
Bad.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.153
I left early
'cause I went to find you.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.422
You did?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.458
I went to the car show
to find you.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.594
Yeah, I know.
Marcy told me at the theater.

17:43.596 --> 17:47.098
Then the usher wouldn't let me
leave for, like, 20 minutes.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.668
When I made a break for it,

17:50.670 --> 17:52.570
the other husbands
cheered for me.

17:55.508 --> 18:00.311
Well, um, what did you want
to say to me at the theater?

18:03.383 --> 18:06.317
Well, what did you want
to say to me at the car show?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.856
Okay.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.226
I guess I wanted to say that

18:15.228 --> 18:19.363
I wasn't having any fun
without you and I missed you.

18:19.365 --> 18:23.501
That's what I was gonna say!

18:26.172 --> 18:28.372
But...

18:28.374 --> 18:30.641
I felt the same way.

18:30.643 --> 18:34.479
Aw. It still worked.

18:34.481 --> 18:38.382
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I ate that hot dog.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.620
That was a dumb thing to do.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.322
It's just...

18:44.324 --> 18:46.324
I was scared.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.427
That delivery room,
all those machines

18:49.429 --> 18:53.898
and metal clanking and people
coming to life, it was like...

18:53.900 --> 18:56.567
like Frankenstein's laboratory.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.571
And then I looked
out the window

19:00.573 --> 19:04.342
and I saw an old, familiar
friend, the hot dog.

19:04.344 --> 19:08.412
Yeah. It<i> was</i> pretty
hard-core in there.

19:08.414 --> 19:09.847
(exhales)

19:09.849 --> 19:12.350
I mean, I was on, like,
six different kinds of drugs,

19:12.352 --> 19:15.453
but you had to see
all that sober.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.421
But you were awesome.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.560
Hey, remember how mad
that delivery room nurse

19:22.562 --> 19:24.495
got at you for
eating in there?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.398
Yeah. She remembered me when
we went back to have Teddy.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.600
She called me Dr. Wiener.

19:30.737 --> 19:34.238
Made me a name tag
and everything.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.407
I might've told her
to do that.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.842
(chuckles)

19:40.380 --> 19:42.180
You know what, babe?

19:43.349 --> 19:46.684
I'm thinking
our baggage isn't baggage.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.887
It's just... it's memories
of our life together.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.889
Yeah.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.525
I love our memories.

19:54.527 --> 19:58.329
That day Katie was born was
one of the best days of my life.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.264
Yeah, and afterwards,
those doctors sent us home

20:00.266 --> 20:02.433
with a baby like we knew
what we were doing.

20:04.604 --> 20:08.472
Well, we did, because
she turned out great.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.542
And then Teddy.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.715
Well, we bounced back
with Emme.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.590
Hey, I need a hot dog.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.758
Want grilled onions?
Takes a little longer.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.829
Well, I'm kind of in a hurry,
but, yeah, I want them.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.732
(cell phone rings)

20:34.734 --> 20:36.400
Hello?

20:36.402 --> 20:37.969
It's happening?

20:37.971 --> 20:39.437
Okay, I'll be right there.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.538
Hey, how much longer
on those onions?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.473
A couple more minutes.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.407
Well, take your time,
get them right.
