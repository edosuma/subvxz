WEBVTT

00:23.320 --> 00:24.719
Jogging.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.591
I did a fart the other day
that was exactly like Mum's.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.836
A door opening or suspicious duck?

00:34.880 --> 00:36.279
Door opening.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.194
Mean's your getting mum's bum.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.992
God, I'd be lucky.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.951
My bottom dropped ages ago.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.116
My farts used to be like, pah.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.393
Now they're just sort of
fighting their way out.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.314
I haven't farted in about three years.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.155
Happy Birthday.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.074
She won't eat it.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.315
Thanks.

01:03.840 --> 01:09.950
So, it's a 7pm arrival tonight
for a 7:30 surprise, OK?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.354
Yeah, I got your email.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.959
It's really a business birthday thing.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.356
It won't be much fun
so just don't expect a party party.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.629
I won't.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.594
And maybe just wear trousers.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.039
And don't drink too much.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.957
There's this huge promotion in Finland.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.517
So this party is quite a serious...
I mean, it's basically a business meeting.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.437
Sounds like a blast.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.675
Can I bring a date?

01:32.720 --> 01:34.199
Harry?

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
Who?

01:35.920 --> 01:37.752
Oh, I don't know yet.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.394
It's really inappropriate
to jog around a graveyard.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.475
Why?

01:45.720 --> 01:48.075
Flaunting your life.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.790
God, I can't wait to be old.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.313
If it's any consolation,
you look older than you are.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.350
PHONE RINGS

02:04.680 --> 02:06.353
Sorry. Sorry.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.470
Hello, Claire speaking.
- Mum died three years ago.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.750
She had a double mastectomy
but never really recovered.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.714
It was particularly hard
'cause she had amazing boobs.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.754
She used to tell me I was lucky
'cause mine would never get in the way.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.871
My sister's got whoppers.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.230
But she got all of Mum's good bits.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.474
What's Martin given you?

02:26.520 --> 02:28.955
Oh, cursory stroke'd be nice.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.513
What? No bang bang?

02:30.560 --> 02:34.554
He say's he's still got
that thing on his...

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
What?

02:36.840 --> 02:38.319
On his...

02:38.800 --> 02:40.029
Come on, you can do it.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.673
I don't have to say.
- Yes, you do.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.960
No, not here. No.
- Come on, little one, come on, please.

02:43.984 --> 02:45.577
Penis.
- Thank you.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.912
He says he still has
that thing on his penis, sorry.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.752
Christ. Look at that man, tragic.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.154
MAN SOBS

03:00.200 --> 03:01.474
FLEABAG:
Nah, he's a con.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.911
You can't call someone
who is grieving a con.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.633
That is shit grieving.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.896
Look at him. He is properly keening.
- No one grieve-s like that...

03:08.920 --> 03:10.856
Who are you to pass judgement on his grief?
- unless you're in a film or from Italy.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.032
Trust me, he's at a different grave
every day. He can't get enough of it.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.151
MAN SOBS

03:18.040 --> 03:19.314
What?

03:19.360 --> 03:21.431
You come here every day?

03:26.720 --> 03:29.314
Don't do a jumpy-outy surprise thing

03:29.360 --> 03:32.193
and don't sing happy birthday,
I couldn't bear it.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.514
I'm, erm...

03:35.600 --> 03:38.069
I'm actually looking forward to it.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.116
FLEABAG:
Hi, Harry, it's me...

03:42.160 --> 03:43.520
Um, listen, I know we're broken up

03:43.544 --> 03:46.138
but it's Claire's birthday tonight
and I thought that, um...

03:49.360 --> 03:53.194
Er, I thought that maybe, erm...
you'd like to come to her...

03:54.880 --> 03:56.393
birthday party.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.513
Um, anyway, give me a call
and hope you're OK. Bye.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.753
Can't go outwith a dog.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.878
CAMERA CLICKS

04:22.200 --> 04:23.952
My boyfriend before Harry

04:24.000 --> 04:26.992
used to make me send him pictures
of my vagina wherever I <i>was.</i>

04:27.040 --> 04:28.792
Ten or eleven times a day.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.150
One day when I was temping,
he asked me to...

04:31.200 --> 04:32.634
3:1“

04:37.400 --> 04:39.198
3:1“

04:43.640 --> 04:44.869
CAMERA CLICKS

04:46.880 --> 04:48.279
3:1“

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
CAMERA CLICKS

04:53.400 --> 04:54.799
3:1“

05:00.440 --> 05:01.635
CAMERA CLICKS

05:06.520 --> 05:08.352
Time to throw the net out.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.590
MULTIPLE SEND NOISES

05:12.320 --> 05:13.993
I am so in trouble.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.474
Jesus Christ.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.476
What am I gonna get Claire?

05:16.520 --> 05:18.318
I am meant to get her
the perfect present.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.919
I am not drunk.

05:19.960 --> 05:20.960
Always drunk.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.037
I am not drunk.
- Oh.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.117
Which is odd
because Claire's so straight.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.037
Smack me in the face. Really hard.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.718
Really?
- Yeah.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.110
CUSTOMER:
Oh. OK.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.920
Fuck. Think you've given me a semi.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.280
HE LAUGHS

05:37.320 --> 05:40.711
Can I eat a water
or a sandwich or something?

05:40.760 --> 05:42.592
I mean, the man's got a problem.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.109
Oh, speak to me. Speak to me.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.840
But no one wants to admit
there's a problem

05:46.886 --> 05:49.806
because then they don't get to have
crazy nights outwith fun drunk Martin.

05:49.846 --> 05:51.590
Chicken, are you chicken? No.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.679
He's one of those men who is explosively
sexually inappropriate with everyone

05:55.720 --> 05:59.839
but makes you feel bad if you take offence
because he was just being fun.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.032
Honestly, you could tell him you're
gonna pop to the loo and he'll say...

06:03.080 --> 06:05.071
Yes, you pop to the loo

06:05.120 --> 06:09.318
pull down your kickers and then
I will come in and fuck you.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.920
HE LAUGHS

06:14.320 --> 06:16.038
I mean, this place is ridiculous.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.832
Does anyone ever come in here?

06:17.880 --> 06:20.440
I mean, it is creepy as fuck.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.154
Why don't you get her a guinea pig?
It was a surprise hit here.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.315
What? Do you think she'd like a pig?
Can I take this one?

06:26.360 --> 06:27.509
No, not that one.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.999
Christ, woman.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.640
There's something wrong with that one,
it's got death in its eyes.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.230
Yeah. Vet says she's depressed.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.156
Oh.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.237
Aren't we all, girl?

06:39.080 --> 06:41.913
You know, guinea pigs
can die of loneliness.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.754
Can they?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.799
Hold her.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.433
She needs it.
- No.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.235
Ssh.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.234
I have an idea.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.715
Ah, he's sexually inappropriate
and he eats raw sausages

06:53.760 --> 06:56.036
but no one's made her laugh like he does

06:56.080 --> 06:57.639
so, I guess I have to give him that.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.559
Right, just put your, wait,
what are you doing, what are you doing?

07:00.600 --> 07:01.556
No.
- All right, stop it.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.116
No, no, no, there. There we go.
- THEY LAUGH

07:06.000 --> 07:08.071
I'm an innocent man.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.794
I bought her a necklace
with her name on it

07:10.840 --> 07:12.911
that she found
and told me not to buy.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.112
I bought her a book,
that she already has.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.913
And she says not to buy her any clothes

07:18.960 --> 07:21.679
because she probably won't wear them.
She scares me.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.755
Oh, this sandwich is so good.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.234
Look, this is London.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.999
Just fuck off and buy something
weird and expensive.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.793
No, no. It's gotta be good,
all right? Help me.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.116
Pay me and I'll help you.
- Fuck off.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.639
How much?

07:36.680 --> 07:38.478
£60.
- 70.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.874
Done.
- Yeah.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.756
I don't know who she is.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.355
Is she...?

07:49.600 --> 07:50.829
No.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.718
What about...?

07:54.280 --> 07:55.475
No.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.432
Just... get whoever you are.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.679
Who are you?

08:03.440 --> 08:06.398
I don't know, I... wanna be that person.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.356
I have been that person.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.400
Hot.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.673
But most of the time I'm that person,
like everyone else.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.795
They're good, right? Chic?

08:16.840 --> 08:19.275
Chic means boring.
Don't tell the French.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.674
What about these?

08:20.720 --> 08:22.313
No. God.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.396
Look, stop checking, all right?
Nobody loves you. Help me here.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.000
Who is this person?

08:33.039 --> 08:35.316
Oh, fuck no.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.957
This is perfect!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.991
Get her something
she'd never get herself.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.188
Surprise her.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.799
She'll think I've gone nuts.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.195
No, she'll think you see her
as this person.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.675
And everyone wants to be this person.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.949
I don't know.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.310
Aren't these for children?

08:51.360 --> 08:52.360
No.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.074
Let's keep going.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.350
I saw some more stuff
she'll hate over there.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.231
COUPLE LAUGHS

09:05.920 --> 09:09.709
My neighbour is really fit.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.512
Which one?
- The fit one.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.119
The one with the sexy big belly?

09:13.160 --> 09:14.878
No, no, he's the other neighbour.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.355
He's like, he's like, OK.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.798
I'm gonna hold his face in my head
so you can see him.

09:20.840 --> 09:21.989
OK.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.597
I'm not getting anything.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.029
Make your face his face.
- Yeah, OK.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.836
Is he mixed race? I'm getting mixed...
- BOO GASPS

09:36.880 --> 09:38.154
Yes!
- DOOR SLAMS

09:39.336 --> 09:40.336
That's him.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.589
Go on...

09:41.640 --> 09:42.710
(30. Yes.

09:42.760 --> 09:43.830
OK. OK!

09:49.600 --> 09:50.954
Jesus.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.355
I'm really sorry, we're really high.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.199
We just really wanted to know
what you look like.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.350
She thinks you're lovely.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.679
Oh my God, look at my elegant feet.

10:18.920 --> 10:23.915
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey. Hello? Hey. Hey!

10:25.440 --> 10:27.317
What's your problem? Who was that?

10:27.360 --> 10:31.149
Er... Oh, no one, it was, er, what?

10:31.200 --> 10:34.989
No, no one, I just need to, I just need
to go and get a drink, or something.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.595
OK.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.836
Cool. Excellent.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.837
Can I go get my shoes?

10:40.880 --> 10:43.030
Yeah. OK.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.589
Whoa! Easy, tiger.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.358
HE LAUGHS

10:56.320 --> 10:57.799
Coming from you.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.238
So, come on,
who is that heartbreaker, hmm?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.116
He used to go out with 800.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.280
And then he slept with
someone else and then she...

11:10.600 --> 11:13.638
Yeah, yeah. I know, OK. Fuck.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.917
I've never really said how sorry I was.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.519
You should get the trainers.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.959
She'll say I don't know her.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.035
You don't.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.798
You're just as bad.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.674
It's never clear what she wants.
I should just get her some perfume.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.633
Jesus. Just fuck her.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.717
Please, for the love of a good woman

11:33.760 --> 11:36.036
just wrap your willy up in a bow
and just screw her.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.559
She's going insane.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.479
What is it?

11:43.400 --> 11:44.959
You having an affair?

11:49.240 --> 11:52.119
Think you're a clever little puss,
don't you?

11:53.280 --> 11:55.191
Little marital poke isn't gonna kill you.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.550
Would it kill her to take me out to dinner?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.273
You girls, Jesus.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.152
Anyone said that to her,
they'd be hung.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.400
If they were hung, she probably
wouldn't be complaining.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.669
Little advice, from a married man.

12:17.720 --> 12:18.790
Oh.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.880
You should probably
get yourself out there, sweetie.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.993
You're just tipping your prime.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.553
Another drink, hmm?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.637
PHONE BEEPS
- Bingo.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.234
Excuse me, I have a date.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.839
Get the trainers, shop closes in an hour.

12:43.840 --> 12:47.959
Whoa, God, I was not
expecting to see you again.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.070
Shut up.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.120
I mean don't get me wrong,
I am chuffed to my boots

12:51.144 --> 12:53.832
but yeah, oh, and thank you
for the text. Saucy.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.440
HE LAUGHS
- Oh, and sorry I'm late.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.993
Oh no, it's fine, it was last minute.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.509
No, no, no, I am such a tool box.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.736
You know, I'd like to say I was
trying to save a puppy or something

13:02.760 --> 13:05.521
but I just got my coat caught on
someone else's coat outside the Tube.

13:05.562 --> 13:07.618
You know, we had to separate ourselves,
it was fucking intense.

13:07.642 --> 13:09.477
I had to give him my coat.
- HE LAUGHS

13:09.520 --> 13:10.590
What are we doing?

13:10.640 --> 13:12.480
Well, it's my sister's
surprise birthday party.

13:12.504 --> 13:13.794
I love surprises, go on.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.200
Yeah, but I just thought,
I need to get her a present first.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.760
Oh my God, what are you gonna get her?

13:17.784 --> 13:19.398
I know this beautiful soap shop.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.717
I mean, this stuff just
gets you straight in the bath.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.115
Oh, I was thinking more like...
- Yeah?

13:27.960 --> 13:32.557
Oh yeah, these places,
all the time, so yeah.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.480
FLEABAG:
You OK?

13:35.520 --> 13:36.520
Yeah.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.312
Sorry. I won't be long.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.634
Oh...

13:45.280 --> 13:46.509
FLEABAG: Hi.
- Hey.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.312
What are you craving?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.670
Oh, just a really, really cheap thrill.

13:50.720 --> 13:51.630
For you?

13:51.680 --> 13:53.671
Ooh. Hello.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.677
No, it's for her sister.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.280
Yeah, it's for my very
sexually frustrated sister.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.680
Just a basic bunny would be great.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.076
OK. Well, I'll see what I can dig out
and you go browse.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.153
Thanks.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.398
Oh.
- TOY VI BRATES

14:14.760 --> 14:16.671
Oh, I think you just
do it at the bottom.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.360
VIBRATING CONTINUES
- HE LAUGHS

14:19.400 --> 14:21.198
SHE LAUGHS
- VIBRATING STOPS

14:21.240 --> 14:23.038
It's always a twist.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.035
Ooh.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.678
THEY LAUGH

14:30.720 --> 14:32.393
Whoa.
- I know.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.909
Yeah. You should totally
get one of those.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.439
A vagina?
- Yeah.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.800
Oh, I've already got one.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.597
Really? You have?
No, you've got one?

14:41.640 --> 14:43.119
I take it with me everywhere.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.753
Look, no, you lie.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.518
You don't have one on you now?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.039
Yeah. Never gonna get it.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.354
Where?

14:49.400 --> 14:50.754
Where's my vagina?
- Yeah.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.236
Where's my vagina?
- Yeah.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.075
Ha, you got me!

14:56.120 --> 14:58.714
I don't carry a vagina around with me.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.513
That'd be way too provocative.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.833
Didn't get it.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.678
OK, so this one's really great.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.553
It's half price because
it's quite relentless.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.193
It's called The Burrower.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.358
Basically it doesn't stop
until you've come.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.038
Excuse me

15:16.080 --> 15:18.356
Oh, don't worry about him.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.595
He'll be fine in a minute.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.758
Oh my god,
I love surprise parties.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.269
I love them, I love them,
I love them, I love!

15:25.320 --> 15:27.200
Will your parents be there?
- My dad might be...

15:27.224 --> 15:28.737
Oh, intense.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.554
Parents adore me.

15:30.600 --> 15:35.037
Um, I want you to be totally in love
with me by the end of the night.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.559
OK?
- OK.

Oh, it's my sister.
- Wow! No. No, no.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.560
We're going to ruin the surprise.
- No, no, we...

15:45.584 --> 15:47.197
No, no, no. - No, really.
- Get down.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.116
It will be fine.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.594
Surprise!

15:49.640 --> 15:51.074
Oh my God.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.873
Thank you so much.
I'm so surprised!

15:53.920 --> 15:55.354
She's very good.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.630
How divine,
what a lovely husband you have.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.839
Where is he then?

16:01.240 --> 16:03.197
GODMOTHER:
Ah, busy.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.680
I'm blown away,
I had absolutely no idea.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.080
Oh, Hildegard, can I just
talk to you for a second?

16:11.520 --> 16:13.431
Hello.
- Hello.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.720

16:24.200 --> 16:26.999
Oh really?
What is your latest project?

16:27.040 --> 16:30.158
Well, sir, I'm interested in life.

16:30.200 --> 16:35.957
And how it affects lots of people
in all sorts of different ways.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.832
Yeah. It's awesome.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.757
How did you two meet?

16:39.800 --> 16:41.438
Oh, I met her on a bus.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.153
So easy to pick up girls these days.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.350
I was like, hi, and she's like
oh take my number.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.277
ALL LAUGH
- I was like yeah.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.555
I'm just gonna see if there are
any other wines to try.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.760
It's lovely, I'm just gonna see
if there's some others.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.310
Excuse me. Can't resist.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.878
Find anything nicer?

17:02.920 --> 17:06.390
Oh, I was so sorry
to hear about Harry.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.113
Lovely Harry.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.798
Love Harry.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.156
Exciting news about his new job.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.436
Yes. Very exciting.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.551
I was so pleased that you
found someone else so fast.

17:18.599 --> 17:19.670
Mm.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.069
I just can't stop conjuring an image
of you sitting around that café.

17:24.119 --> 17:27.271
Just all alone.
Feeling so terribly lonely.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.115
I just can't stop picturing it.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.798
FLEABAG LAUGHS

17:31.840 --> 17:34.070
I don't think you have to be
alone to be lonely.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.236
Dad always taught me that.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.193
Did your father tell you that
one of my pieces has gone missing?

17:40.240 --> 17:43.392
He did. That's awful, I'm so sorry.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.754
So sweet of you. Very sweet.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.793
May I cut in?

17:49.240 --> 17:50.594
Yes, of course.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.599
Do you know, you are
the most perfect-looking pair.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.879
Such a great gang.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.638
Do you want some normal food?

18:00.680 --> 18:02.193
No. No.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.359
Erm, what I really want to do is this.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.552
Whoa!
- GLASSES SMASH

18:08.600 --> 18:10.591
Oh sorry, nothing happened!

18:10.640 --> 18:12.438
I was trying to be sexy.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.596
So... no, it <i>was,</i> it was really sexy.
- Was it?

18:14.640 --> 18:16.039
What broke, what broke? Show me.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.516
Nothing, I just slipped.
Claire, this is my friend...

18:21.720 --> 18:26.510
My wife, my wife, my wife.

18:27.680 --> 18:32.151
All of your desires
are wrapped up in here.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.679
OK.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.790
Open it.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.635
Well, gold has always...

18:46.400 --> 18:48.357
Wow! Er...

18:49.920 --> 18:52.116
That's really rather wonderful.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.915
Thank you. What is it?
Is it a paper weight or...?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.520
It is a shrine to your body.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.833
Because I love your body.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.518
FLEABAG LAUGHS
- Thank you.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.916
Wow! Wow. This is really...

19:06.960 --> 19:10.635
Can I, can I see, it's,
it's really quite something, yes.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.273
Wow, I think it's really...

19:12.320 --> 19:16.632
Might be a bit inappropriate
for your guests to see your body at this...

19:16.680 --> 19:18.360
I'm just... Shall I put it somewhere safe?

19:18.400 --> 19:19.674
OK.

Well, I told you I'd find you a buyer.

19:47.640 --> 19:52.032
Your boy, he is hilarious, smart, funny...

19:52.080 --> 19:53.639
Fuck off.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.751
You'd fuck anything, wouldn't you?

19:58.680 --> 20:01.433
Just don't tell her you got
the statue from me, OK?

20:01.480 --> 20:03.915
Oh. How much do you want for it?

20:03.960 --> 20:06.395
Finger up the ass? Nipple tickle?

20:09.320 --> 20:11.834
Come on. Lighten up.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.235
She's gonna leave you one day.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.076
Looking forward to that?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.672
You're an asshole.

Hey!

21:01.240 --> 21:02.560
Hey.

21:08.640 --> 21:09.960
I think you took my coat.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.336
Oh.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.510
I'm sorry. This is my coat.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.278
Oh, sorry.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.638
Why you leaving so early?

21:17.680 --> 21:22.197
Oh, I have to give Hilary some earl grey.
She's not feeling well, so.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.632
Oh, got you this.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.876
Oh, I wasn't expecting anything.

21:31.960 --> 21:35.396
It's called The Burrower.
It basically won't stop until you come.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.592
Sounds horrendous.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.960
Thank you.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.036
Good birthday business?

21:42.080 --> 21:43.753
Oh, huge.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.075
You know, I don't wanna
jinx anything, but huge.

21:48.120 --> 21:49.793
Could be life-changing.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.554
Great.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.999
OK, happy birthday.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.519

Yeah.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.113
Tell the truth.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.674
Are we leaving?

22:06.696 --> 22:07.696
Yes.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.154
Birthday girl.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.397
Awesome party, thank you so much,

22:42.120 --> 22:43.997
It's like having sex with a protractor.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.236
I'm finishing, I'm finishing.

22:46.280 --> 22:50.513

For fuck's sake.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.190

23:15.400 --> 23:17.994
OK, you don't go through life
with teeth like these
