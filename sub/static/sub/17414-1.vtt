WEBVTT

00:08.066 --> 00:10.167
No one stops us.

00:10.235 --> 00:11.869
No one ever has.

00:15.573 --> 00:16.973
Chuck, did you just flash?

00:17.041 --> 00:18.814
Oh, Chuck me.

00:18.881 --> 00:19.726
Kill him.

00:19.794 --> 00:20.800
Hyah!

00:29.874 --> 00:31.614
Chuck?

00:31.682 --> 00:34.495
Guys...

00:34.562 --> 00:37.169
I know kung fu.

00:50.916 --> 00:52.591
: Agent Carmichael.

00:52.658 --> 00:54.732
Call me "Charles."

00:54.799 --> 00:56.405
You have something

00:56.473 --> 00:58.276
that belongs to my boss, Yuri: the case.

00:58.346 --> 01:00.215
I would like for you to give it to me.

01:01.253 --> 01:02.925
Please?

01:04.030 --> 01:08.974
You show up with no gun and "Please?"

01:09.042 --> 01:10.859
What, I quiver in fear?

01:10.927 --> 01:12.462
Chuck, we've got a lock on the case.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.164
It's there in the room with you.

01:20.374 --> 01:22.645
Give me the case...

01:22.712 --> 01:24.482
or else.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.487
Or else what?

01:26.554 --> 01:29.092
Or else I do this?

01:37.274 --> 01:41.377
No, I was thinking something more like this.

01:43.413 --> 01:45.578
Ha! Cool, cool, cool! Everybody be cool!

01:45.645 --> 01:47.142
Everybody just chill out!

01:47.209 --> 01:49.245
Very, very good. On the ground now.

01:49.312 --> 01:51.483
Nice and easy.

01:51.551 --> 01:52.852
Now, Yuri, hand me that case,

01:52.920 --> 01:54.355
and then after that, it's pirogi time.

01:54.423 --> 01:55.791
Ooh.

01:55.859 --> 01:57.026
Shoot him, Chuck.

01:58.531 --> 02:01.034
Do it.

02:01.102 --> 02:02.503
Shoot me.

02:02.571 --> 02:04.506
Don't mess with me, Yuri.

02:04.574 --> 02:05.609
Shoot him now!

02:05.676 --> 02:06.877
Get him!

02:30.037 --> 02:33.204
Chuck, what is happening?
Your heart rate just spiked.

02:33.272 --> 02:35.472
Are you okay? I'm okay.
I got punched in the face.

02:35.540 --> 02:37.708
It's throbbing a little bit.

02:37.776 --> 02:39.844
Get out of there now!

02:41.881 --> 02:43.114
Where's my exit?

02:43.182 --> 02:44.415
They're closing in on you.

02:44.482 --> 02:45.615
Get to a roof.

02:45.683 --> 02:47.679
Chopper's...

02:49.315 --> 02:50.850
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

02:50.917 --> 02:52.652
Listen, General, I don't
want to sound demanding here,

02:52.720 --> 02:54.654
but I could really use that
chopper right about now!

02:54.722 --> 02:55.889
The chopper's too far out.

02:55.957 --> 02:57.624
Satellite says there's a
power line on the roof

02:57.692 --> 02:58.859
that runs to the next building.

02:58.927 --> 03:00.595
Zip line across,
we'll find you a new exit...

03:00.662 --> 03:02.130
What do you mean, zip line?

03:02.197 --> 03:04.232
It's in the Intersect.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.101
Okay, I got this.

03:13.144 --> 03:16.514
Oh. Oh.

03:16.581 --> 03:17.949
Oh, God. Oh, God.

03:18.016 --> 03:19.550
General, I don't think this is

03:19.618 --> 03:21.386
a good idea. I'm not flashing. Do it, Chuck!

03:21.454 --> 03:22.821
Flash!

03:22.889 --> 03:24.790
Look, if you stress me out,
it's never going to work.

03:24.858 --> 03:26.526
Chuck, flash! Okay.

03:26.593 --> 03:28.595
Okay.

03:29.930 --> 03:31.231
Flash.

03:31.299 --> 03:33.467
One, two, three, flash.

03:33.535 --> 03:36.203
I don't think my vertigo is helping here.

03:36.271 --> 03:38.239
General, are you there?

03:38.307 --> 03:39.474
General?!

03:39.542 --> 03:41.409
You're dead.

03:49.352 --> 03:51.221
That's all, Frank.

03:51.288 --> 03:52.889
Terminate the simulation.

03:52.957 --> 03:54.491
: Copy that, ma'am.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.363
Chuck?

04:00.832 --> 04:02.733
You can come down now.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.773
<i>Why didn't you shoot Yuri, Chuck?</i>

04:08.841 --> 04:11.142
Well, we were very close,
and while I realize

04:11.210 --> 04:13.178
it's just a simulation,
safety first, you know?

04:13.246 --> 04:15.414
And to be perfectly honest,
I'm still not comfortable

04:15.482 --> 04:16.915
with the whole shooting people thing.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.183
This isn't working out.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.184
Look, General, I realize
that we've had our setbacks,

04:20.252 --> 04:23.185
I-I-I do, but let's not
dwell in the past here.

04:23.253 --> 04:25.954
I'm convinced I can be
a great spy. I know it.

04:26.021 --> 04:27.321
We've spent millions of dollars

04:27.388 --> 04:29.823
to get you up and running
as our new Intersect agent.

04:29.890 --> 04:30.990
It's not working.

04:31.058 --> 04:32.358
Well, maybe my dad can help.

04:32.426 --> 04:33.526
He built the computer.

04:33.593 --> 04:35.261
The problem is not with the computer.

04:35.328 --> 04:36.728
It's with you.

04:36.796 --> 04:40.131
The Intersect 2.0 was designed
to go into a real spy,

04:40.199 --> 04:41.499
like Bryce Larkin,

04:41.566 --> 04:43.500
someone in complete
control of their feelings.

04:43.568 --> 04:45.135
What are you saying?

04:45.203 --> 04:46.970
It's over.

04:47.038 --> 04:50.039
Our Los Angeles field unit
will keep an eye on you

04:50.107 --> 04:52.540
until a final decision can be
made regarding your status.

04:52.608 --> 04:54.108
Wait, hold on just-just a second here.

04:54.176 --> 04:55.476
Are you saying you're firing me, General?

04:55.544 --> 04:57.878
Do you... You have any idea
what I gave up for this?

04:57.946 --> 04:58.945
Good-bye, Chuck. No.

04:59.013 --> 05:00.213
You don't know what I said no to!

05:00.281 --> 05:02.414
Frank. Oh.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.058
<i>Go home, tell your sister you went on</i>

05:10.126 --> 05:12.027
<i>a last-minute trip to Europe,
six weeks.</i>

05:12.095 --> 05:13.295
<i>Okay. Where are we really going?</i>

05:13.363 --> 05:14.396
<i>To a Red Site</i>

05:14.464 --> 05:15.297
<i>training facility.</i>

05:15.365 --> 05:17.065
Training for what?

05:17.133 --> 05:18.530
For you, moron.

05:18.598 --> 05:19.730
The new Intersect.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.131
They're gonna train you to use it,

05:21.198 --> 05:22.531
turn you into a real super-spy.

05:22.599 --> 05:24.133
Sarah, did Casey tell you

05:24.200 --> 05:25.867
they're moving me to a training facility?

05:25.935 --> 05:27.868
I'm going to be a real spy. I know, I heard.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.569
Come on. What...?

05:30.872 --> 05:31.972
What's the matter?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.473
If you do this, if you go,

05:33.541 --> 05:35.842
you're gonna be a spy for
the rest of your life.

05:35.910 --> 05:38.578
Every city is gonna be a new
mission and a new identity,

05:38.646 --> 05:40.580
and you're not gonna be the same person.

05:40.648 --> 05:42.249
Yeah. That's a great thing.

05:42.316 --> 05:45.488
Chuck, listen. We could...

05:45.556 --> 05:47.423
We could what?

05:47.491 --> 05:49.925
We could run?

05:49.992 --> 05:52.593
Together. You and me.

05:52.661 --> 05:55.295
We go now, and we never look back.

05:56.330 --> 05:57.930
Are you serious?

05:57.997 --> 05:59.297
I have some money saved up.

05:59.365 --> 06:01.099
I'd have to get us some new identities,

06:01.166 --> 06:02.366
create an escape route.

06:02.434 --> 06:04.434
For now, go to the training
facility in Prague,

06:04.502 --> 06:06.269
then meet me at the Nadrazi train station

06:06.336 --> 06:07.571
in three weeks' time at 7:00,

06:07.639 --> 06:09.307
and then I can figure the rest out later.

06:10.342 --> 06:12.410
What are you saying?

06:12.477 --> 06:15.846
I'm saying I want to be a real person again.

06:15.914 --> 06:17.582
With you.

06:17.650 --> 06:21.852
This is what you want, right?

06:21.920 --> 06:24.053
I mean, this is it, Chuck.

06:24.121 --> 06:26.322
Will you run away with me?

06:35.699 --> 06:38.133
Yeah.

06:41.036 --> 06:44.473
<i>Chuck? Chuck, what happened?</i>

06:47.480 --> 06:49.547
Chuck, honey, where's Sarah?

06:49.615 --> 06:51.149
I lost her.

06:52.684 --> 06:54.084
The girl of my dreams.

06:54.152 --> 06:55.286
It was all my fault.

06:55.353 --> 06:56.586
Well, maybe not.

06:56.654 --> 06:58.288
Why don't you just pick
up the phone and call her?

06:58.356 --> 06:59.856
You guys can work it out.

06:59.923 --> 07:01.557
I'm sure she misses you, too.

07:01.625 --> 07:03.659
* *

07:18.605 --> 07:20.606
Your phone, my dear.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.046
Pick up, Sarah.

07:41.325 --> 07:44.760

08:30.595 --> 08:32.195
Morning, Chuck.

08:32.263 --> 08:33.630
Morning, bro. Mm-hmm.

08:33.698 --> 08:34.998
Chuck, you feeling any better?

08:35.066 --> 08:36.166
You got a game plan?

08:36.234 --> 08:38.235
Job hunting? Probably not.

08:40.669 --> 08:41.969
No rush, amigo,

08:42.037 --> 08:45.037
but how long you think you'll be staying?

08:45.105 --> 08:47.672
* *

09:05.191 --> 09:07.125
Chuck?

09:07.193 --> 09:10.628
Chuck, if you won't talk to me,
then you have a visitor.

09:12.063 --> 09:13.330
Chuck!

09:13.397 --> 09:15.331
Chuck?

09:15.399 --> 09:17.366
It's-It's me, man.

09:18.734 --> 09:20.335
Morgan. Ow.

09:20.402 --> 09:21.836
Morgan?! Yeah?

09:23.004 --> 09:24.204
Is that you?

09:24.272 --> 09:25.539
It is. It is. Ah.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.807
I-I'm back for a few days.

09:26.875 --> 09:27.975
Hawaii is great.

09:28.042 --> 09:29.876
And Benihana... Forget about it.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.377
Flying through the ranks.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.613
That's it, man. I'm gonna
be master chef in no time.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.013
I'm so proud of you.

09:35.081 --> 09:36.948
We should get together soon, you know.
You and I sit down and...

09:37.016 --> 09:38.649
Yeah? No. I would love that.
That's exactly what I thought...

09:40.085 --> 09:41.853
Hmm.

09:46.458 --> 09:48.125
Worse than I thought.

09:48.193 --> 09:50.227
All right, Chuck, that is enough!

09:50.295 --> 09:52.162
Sit up! You are getting off this couch.

09:52.230 --> 09:54.197
And you are going to do something

09:54.264 --> 09:55.729
today.

09:55.797 --> 09:57.729
Out! Out!

09:57.797 --> 09:59.230
I tried, guys.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.665
Leave him with his cheese balls.

10:00.732 --> 10:02.099
That's all he cares about.

10:32.527 --> 10:34.494
Hello, sir.

10:34.562 --> 10:35.695
How may I service you?

10:35.763 --> 10:37.029
n deep voice): Uh...

10:37.097 --> 10:39.464
I'm looking for cheese puffs?

10:39.531 --> 10:40.765
Aisle 3.

10:40.833 --> 10:42.400
It's been a pleasure serving you.

10:51.242 --> 10:53.075
Look at that wretch.

10:53.143 --> 10:56.310
Security, we have a
street person in aisle 3.

10:56.378 --> 10:58.679
Could be the one stealing
toilet paper from the bathroom.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.888
Gotcha. Hand it over, punk.

11:12.158 --> 11:14.492
Bartowski?

11:17.395 --> 11:20.696
Oh, Chuck Bartowski?

11:23.433 --> 11:26.168
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

11:26.236 --> 11:27.603
Get a good look, everybody.

11:27.671 --> 11:29.005
Everybody, everybody, come hither.

11:29.072 --> 11:30.373
Come hither.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.441
Take a sniff.

11:36.044 --> 11:38.578
That is the putrid stench of failure.

11:38.646 --> 11:40.914
That's why you don't leave the Buy More.

11:40.982 --> 11:44.250
Okay. You become feral.

11:44.318 --> 11:45.718
Wretched.

11:45.786 --> 11:47.820
You're just another loser.

11:51.758 --> 11:53.358
My God, you're pathetic.

11:53.426 --> 11:56.894
Sneaking back into the Buy More like some...

11:56.961 --> 11:58.128
vagrant Serpico.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.065
Goodness.

12:03.132 --> 12:05.967
You're a hot mess. Emmett, please.

12:06.035 --> 12:08.236
I'm sorry. Do you have something to say?

12:08.304 --> 12:09.471
Right here.

12:15.043 --> 12:17.611
No, I have nothing to say.
I'm good. I'm okay. I'm good.

12:17.679 --> 12:19.779
Oh, that's what I thought.

12:21.215 --> 12:22.648
Well, it's a good thing

12:22.716 --> 12:24.850
because you don't know how close you came

12:24.918 --> 12:27.552
to getting your ass kicked.

12:34.724 --> 12:36.291
Oh, Captain, my Captain!

12:36.359 --> 12:37.559
Please tell us that you've returned

12:37.626 --> 12:39.195
to take control of the Buy More!

12:39.262 --> 12:41.966
Look, I'm... I'm sorry, fellas.

12:42.033 --> 12:44.001
I'm-I'm sorry, everyone. I don't think

12:44.068 --> 12:46.002
I could help even if I tried.
Yeah, no, I know. I know.

12:46.070 --> 12:47.670
What do you care about our troubles?
You still got blondie.

12:47.738 --> 12:48.838
Actually, we're not...

12:48.906 --> 12:49.872
I think she's getting hotter.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.306
Agreed. Her ass seems

12:51.374 --> 12:52.841
to be lifting ever so slightly.

12:52.909 --> 12:53.875
Listen, Charles... What?

12:53.943 --> 12:55.043
Ass.

12:55.110 --> 12:56.077
No. What?

12:56.145 --> 12:57.144
You've seen her?

12:57.212 --> 12:58.612
Just through the lens of a telescope

12:58.679 --> 13:01.014
when she goes in and out
of that nasty yogurt shop.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.717
She's still here?!

13:10.390 --> 13:11.990
Sarah?

13:12.058 --> 13:13.858
Hello?

13:25.936 --> 13:29.038
Heard you were a lemon,
but this is pathetic, Bartowski.

13:29.105 --> 13:31.540
Even for you.

13:31.608 --> 13:33.408
What the hell are you doing here?

13:33.476 --> 13:36.644
I think that I left a light jacket

13:36.712 --> 13:38.712
in Castle. I was just here to pick it up.

13:38.780 --> 13:40.780
Clean those up.

13:42.983 --> 13:44.917
Hurry it up. I gotta finish packing.

13:44.984 --> 13:47.319
What's been going on in the biz?

13:47.386 --> 13:50.488
You, uh, talk to any of the old gang?

13:50.555 --> 13:51.922
Sarah, for instance?

13:51.990 --> 13:53.858
Nope.

13:56.898 --> 13:58.199
Really?

13:58.266 --> 13:59.166
Yeah?

13:59.234 --> 14:00.200
Mm-hmm. Can I talk to her

14:00.268 --> 14:01.668
when you're done?

14:01.736 --> 14:03.270
Yeah.

14:03.338 --> 14:04.905
7:00. Mm-hmm.

14:04.972 --> 14:06.907
Yeah. Just tell her...

14:06.974 --> 14:08.375
if you could just ask her

14:08.443 --> 14:10.711
if she's gotten my messages
because I've been calling...

14:10.778 --> 14:12.345
a lot.

14:12.413 --> 14:13.746
It's the Lemon.

14:15.282 --> 14:17.082
Duly noted. See ya tonight.

14:18.851 --> 14:20.918
Did she say anything about me?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.252
Nope.

14:24.186 --> 14:25.352
Hey, you guys going

14:25.419 --> 14:26.386
on a mission? You need backup?

14:26.453 --> 14:27.420
I can still flash.

14:29.089 --> 14:31.055
Not what I heard.

14:31.123 --> 14:32.557
Come on, Casey, please.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.225
Beckman canned me, all right, man.

14:34.293 --> 14:36.127
I need to prove to her
that I can still do this.

14:36.195 --> 14:38.129
That I can still be a spy.

14:38.197 --> 14:39.730
Can you?

14:39.798 --> 14:41.365
Yes, I can. And this could work, too.

14:41.433 --> 14:42.633
Because if I help you guys,

14:42.700 --> 14:44.935
then maybe Beckman puts the
old team back together.

14:45.002 --> 14:46.769
Hmm.

14:46.837 --> 14:48.704
And all my dreams come true.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.447
What?

14:57.515 --> 14:58.648
I'm heading out.

14:58.716 --> 15:01.651
Enjoy your spy game thing.

15:01.718 --> 15:03.319
And stay in touch.

15:03.387 --> 15:04.721
Hey.

15:04.788 --> 15:06.956
What happened between you and Walker?

15:07.991 --> 15:10.793
Something I need to fix.

15:40.547 --> 15:42.580
* *

15:54.157 --> 15:57.092
Um, somebody called about
a computer emergency.

15:57.159 --> 16:00.094
Sound board's down.

16:00.162 --> 16:02.163
Cool. Thanks.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.174
Walker, we have a situation.

16:39.895 --> 16:41.496
Hello, Chuck.

16:41.564 --> 16:42.663
What are you doing here?

16:42.731 --> 16:44.365
Don't worry. This is not about us.

16:44.433 --> 16:45.332
I'm purely here for backup.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.467
I need to prove to Beckman...

16:46.534 --> 16:47.467
Kiss me.

16:47.535 --> 16:48.668
What? Right now?

16:48.736 --> 16:49.769
Don't you think we should

16:49.837 --> 16:50.737
talk first? I'm getting mixed signals.

16:50.804 --> 16:53.339
Kiss me now!

17:05.817 --> 17:07.251
Who the hell is that?

17:07.318 --> 17:09.085
Uh... just my ex.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.920
He's having some trouble letting go.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.055
Hmm.

17:18.306 --> 17:18.972
Why'd you knock him out?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.440
It was a slap. Mmm.

17:20.508 --> 17:22.474
Lemon's got a glass jaw.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.111
I was caught off guard on
an empty stomach, okay?

17:25.178 --> 17:27.146
I didn't eat anything. I can take a punch.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.280
You mean a slap.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.452
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, guys.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.154
I didn't mean to screw anything up.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.655
I just came here to help out.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.691
Things went wrong in Prague,
I don't know why,

17:39.758 --> 17:41.359
but I know that I can do this.

17:41.426 --> 17:42.560
I can be a spy.

17:45.696 --> 17:47.430
Sarah, you know I can.

17:47.498 --> 17:49.298
Please.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.234
Get him out of here.

17:54.269 --> 17:55.601
You heard the lady.

17:55.669 --> 17:56.635
Get out of here.

17:56.702 --> 17:57.969
Casey, wait, wait, wait.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.136
I can help you. Bartowski,

17:59.204 --> 18:00.570
it's a simple courier exchange.

18:00.638 --> 18:02.804
Gilles, the guy with Walker,

18:02.872 --> 18:03.972
he's the mark.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.806
He's meeting with a major
Ring operative tonight.

18:05.874 --> 18:07.274
The Ring? They killed Bryce.

18:07.342 --> 18:10.010
The moment the Ring courier
meets with Gilles, we strike.

18:10.078 --> 18:11.811
Now, get out of here
before you spook Javier.

18:11.879 --> 18:12.612
Who?

18:12.680 --> 18:14.013
The courier, Javier Cruz.

18:14.081 --> 18:15.681
: Get him out of here.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.150
<i>Javier Cruz.</i>

18:22.356 --> 18:24.023
Casey, Javier's not a courier!

18:24.091 --> 18:25.191
Come on, buddy. Let's go. No, guys.

18:25.259 --> 18:26.292
Guys, you have to listen to me.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.460
Javier's not who you think he is!

18:27.527 --> 18:28.460
He's an assassin! Trust me!

18:28.528 --> 18:29.528
He's here to kill someone.

18:31.198 --> 18:33.500
We dumped the Lemon.

18:37.304 --> 18:38.904
Let me back in!

18:38.972 --> 18:41.573
Let me back in!

18:43.642 --> 18:45.909
Come on.

18:45.977 --> 18:47.244
Come...

18:47.312 --> 18:48.812
Okay. Okay.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.813
All right. All right.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.648
Oh, son of a...

18:52.716 --> 18:54.051
That's going to leave a mark.

18:54.119 --> 18:55.720
Okay. Okay.

18:55.787 --> 18:56.720
Calm down, Chuck.

18:56.788 --> 18:58.789
Don't be emotional.

19:02.826 --> 19:04.493
Excuse me.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.227
<i>Por favor...</i>

19:10.731 --> 19:11.860
Oh... oh, my God,

19:11.928 --> 19:12.859
I'm so sorry.

19:12.927 --> 19:14.761
Oh. Oh. I'm so sorry.

19:14.828 --> 19:16.328
My bad. Wake up. Wake up.

19:16.396 --> 19:17.563
Oh, God.

19:17.630 --> 19:18.930
Oh, no.

19:23.736 --> 19:26.437
* *

19:29.707 --> 19:31.675
Where have you been? You're on. What?

19:31.742 --> 19:33.176
Let's go! No, no, wait.

19:33.244 --> 19:34.510
I have to use the little boys'...

19:34.578 --> 19:35.945
the little chicos' room,
little amigos' room.

19:45.154 --> 19:46.254
<i>Hola! Ã‚Â¿Como estas?</i>

19:46.322 --> 19:48.422
Ah!

19:48.490 --> 19:50.124
Yeah.

19:50.191 --> 19:53.126
Hey, where's Manny?

19:53.194 --> 19:54.961
Spastic colon.

19:55.029 --> 19:56.028
I'm filling in for him.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.032
He's going to blow the whole op!

20:01.367 --> 20:02.967
Just give him a second.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.837
* Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma *

20:06.905 --> 20:08.238
* Ma ma ma ma ma ma. *

20:08.306 --> 20:09.906
<i>Bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno.</i>

20:24.219 --> 20:26.053
Where the hell did he learn that?

20:34.728 --> 20:36.129
Isn't that your ex?

20:36.196 --> 20:38.097
Yeah, he's a bit of a show-off.

20:38.164 --> 20:39.464
Just ignore him.

20:40.599 --> 20:42.166
Assassin.

20:43.301 --> 20:44.434
Assassin.

20:44.502 --> 20:45.568
Where?

21:00.715 --> 21:01.982
Do you want my men

21:02.049 --> 21:03.716
to take care of your ex? Uh, no.

21:03.783 --> 21:05.517
Come dance with me.

21:24.601 --> 21:26.535
What is he doing here?

21:26.603 --> 21:28.036
He's just trying to make you jealous.

21:28.104 --> 21:29.638
And that's supposed to be your job.

21:36.610 --> 21:37.577
Wait.

21:37.644 --> 21:38.644
How did he know you were here?

21:38.712 --> 21:39.778
Who is he really?

21:39.846 --> 21:41.480
Tranq him! Take him out now!

21:46.418 --> 21:48.186
* *

21:51.755 --> 21:54.024
You have nothing to worry about.

22:11.208 --> 22:12.875
Sarah!

22:14.444 --> 22:16.345
GILLES: What's going on?

22:16.413 --> 22:18.379
Don't move! Don't you move!

22:19.781 --> 22:21.816
Chuck, what the hell are you doing?

22:21.883 --> 22:23.584
There's a... There's an assassin here.

22:23.652 --> 22:25.052
There's an assassin here, people.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.353
He was gonna kill her.

22:26.421 --> 22:27.988
He was gonna kill you. Where?

22:28.055 --> 22:30.489
Where is he?

22:30.557 --> 22:32.191
Half this club is undercover, Chuck.

22:32.259 --> 22:33.893
Been planning this for months.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.761
Good thing we brought this many agents

22:35.829 --> 22:37.029
'cause I'm gonna kill you! No!

22:37.097 --> 22:38.464
Casey!

22:38.532 --> 22:40.065
Sarah, I flashed.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.232
I swear to you,

22:41.300 --> 22:42.865
there was an assassin here. It was Javier.

22:42.933 --> 22:44.266
Now we'll never know.

22:45.702 --> 22:47.735
You don't work anymore, Chuck. It's over.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.247
Good morning.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.514
Good morning.

23:03.582 --> 23:05.248
Chuck, you shaved.

23:05.316 --> 23:06.349
That's great.

23:06.417 --> 23:09.018
It was a rash decision.

23:09.085 --> 23:11.253
I can't bear to watch him wallow around

23:11.321 --> 23:12.788
like this all day. It's pathetic.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.493
What's up, bro? Huh?

23:20.561 --> 23:21.861
Still playing the loser cover?

23:21.928 --> 23:23.062
You're nailing it.

23:23.130 --> 23:24.798
Not a cover.

23:24.865 --> 23:26.066
It's my life.

23:26.134 --> 23:27.868
I was fired for real.

23:27.935 --> 23:29.402
I'm not a spy anymore.

23:29.470 --> 23:34.039
And to be perfectly honest,
I'm not sure I ever really was.

23:34.107 --> 23:35.974
Whoa. Wait.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.741
This is really you?

23:37.809 --> 23:39.108
Maybe we should be introduced.

23:39.176 --> 23:41.177
Hi. I'm Chuck Bartowski, total loser,

23:41.244 --> 23:43.278
cheese ball addict.

23:43.346 --> 23:47.214
Does the CIA let you just leave like that?

23:47.282 --> 23:49.850
Don't they send someone to,
like, kill you or something?

23:51.752 --> 23:53.854
I think you've watched too many movies.

24:18.339 --> 24:19.806
Don't kill me!

24:19.874 --> 24:21.876
Duh! Holy, dude.

24:21.944 --> 24:23.045
It's-It's just... It's me.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.646
Ellie thought I should come by and...

24:24.714 --> 24:26.383
Thought I might cheer you up. I...

24:26.450 --> 24:27.551
Yeah, well,

24:27.619 --> 24:28.852
thanks, but I wish

24:28.920 --> 24:31.120
everyone would just leave
me alone because I'm fine.

24:31.188 --> 24:32.221
No, you're not, dude.

24:32.289 --> 24:33.389
Come on.

24:33.457 --> 24:35.124
I've known you a long time, pal.

24:35.191 --> 24:36.792
You're slightly unmotivated,

24:36.860 --> 24:38.427
a bit of an underachiever,

24:38.494 --> 24:39.794
but a loser?

24:39.862 --> 24:41.062
It's not your turf.

24:41.130 --> 24:42.763
What's going on?

24:46.100 --> 24:48.068
I blew it, buddy.

24:48.136 --> 24:49.736
Opportunity of a lifetime.

24:49.804 --> 24:51.637
Without getting into specifics,
I had a job offer

24:51.705 --> 24:53.305
that would have included a lot of travel

24:53.373 --> 24:55.673
and excitement, and I've already
been fired from it twice.

24:55.741 --> 24:57.575
Amateur hour.

24:57.643 --> 24:59.843
You haven't even scratched the surface.

24:59.911 --> 25:02.013
You want to see rock bottom? Okay.

25:02.081 --> 25:04.348
Follow me, sir.

25:04.416 --> 25:06.984
<i>So, I got canned from Benihana</i>

25:07.051 --> 25:08.151
a few weeks ago,

25:08.219 --> 25:10.020
and Anna took off with the prep chef.

25:10.087 --> 25:11.287
I lost my mojo.

25:11.355 --> 25:12.521
Couldn't flip the shrimp.

25:12.589 --> 25:14.490
Couldn't flip the shrimp.

25:17.893 --> 25:19.494
Bed,

25:19.561 --> 25:20.928
TV,

25:20.996 --> 25:23.264
microwave for meals.

25:23.331 --> 25:26.533
And of course, machine for laundry.

25:26.601 --> 25:28.501
Drink in it, Chuck.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.403
This is as low as a man can get.

25:30.470 --> 25:31.504
Grimes.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.139
So he's been the one stealing the TP.

25:34.207 --> 25:35.608
Well, I should have known

25:35.675 --> 25:38.043
he'd never make it in an
Asian business culture.

25:38.110 --> 25:41.045
I'll have the authorities
deal with him tomorrow.

25:47.886 --> 25:50.353
I'm gonna miss this.

25:50.420 --> 25:51.820
What?

25:51.888 --> 25:54.557
M-134 mini-gun.

25:54.624 --> 25:56.493
3,400 rounds a minute.

25:56.561 --> 25:58.363
Never got to use her.

26:01.566 --> 26:03.567
Poor bastard.

26:03.635 --> 26:04.734
Who?

26:04.802 --> 26:06.369
Moron that's still in love with you.

26:06.437 --> 26:08.604
I promise you, Casey,
he's not in love with me.

26:08.671 --> 26:11.039
Oh, come on. I don't know
what happened between you two.

26:11.107 --> 26:12.440
Don't want to.

26:12.508 --> 26:14.542
Just saying I've seen men have
their fingernails pulled off

26:14.610 --> 26:16.210
treated more humanely than you did that kid.

26:16.277 --> 26:18.211
Well, I was just doing my job.

26:18.279 --> 26:19.546
Job's over.

26:19.613 --> 26:21.313
Put him out of his misery.

26:21.381 --> 26:23.382
He deserves that much.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.421
Oh.

26:36.758 --> 26:39.125
* *

26:40.894 --> 26:42.895
Wait a second.

26:43.897 --> 26:45.330
Hello!

26:50.871 --> 26:53.905
Uh... can I help you?

26:57.041 --> 26:59.576
Where can I find this man?

26:59.643 --> 27:00.910
Oh, don't ask me.

27:00.978 --> 27:02.678
He's no longer an employee at this store.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.147
If you want to find him,
you can walk out front

27:05.215 --> 27:06.382
and follow the smell.

27:08.552 --> 27:10.386
You can leave now.

27:12.556 --> 27:15.291
Okay. Okay.

27:15.359 --> 27:17.993
We can do this the easy way,

27:18.061 --> 27:21.096
or the hard way.

27:21.164 --> 27:22.431
I got Mace.

27:24.133 --> 27:25.400
Yeah.

27:25.468 --> 27:27.902
So you better get your Brokeback boots

27:27.970 --> 27:29.403
off my property,

27:29.471 --> 27:32.071
or I'm gonna send you crying
back to your mommy's womb.

27:34.307 --> 27:36.775
Yeah.

27:38.310 --> 27:40.311
Oh...

27:45.151 --> 27:47.685
* *

28:00.593 --> 28:02.527
<i>Say good-bye forever, pal.</i>

28:02.595 --> 28:04.162
Had some good years here.

28:04.229 --> 28:05.363
Yeah, to be honest,

28:05.430 --> 28:08.432
I think I'd rather forget
it all ever happened.

28:10.735 --> 28:12.769
Right. Uh, why don't I give
you guys a few seconds,

28:12.837 --> 28:14.504
and I'll just see you back at your place?

28:14.571 --> 28:15.671
Yeah.

28:15.739 --> 28:16.672
Thanks, buddy. Yeah, yeah.

28:16.740 --> 28:17.806
Hey, Sarah.

28:17.874 --> 28:19.875
Hey.

28:24.813 --> 28:27.848
I wanted to say a proper good-bye.

28:35.055 --> 28:37.556
It's been a pleasure working
with you, Agent Walker.

28:38.591 --> 28:41.059
You, too, Agent Bartowski.

28:41.127 --> 28:44.462
I appreciate that, but I think we both know

28:44.529 --> 28:48.298
that the whole agent thing
didn't really work out.

28:48.366 --> 28:49.432
If I could go back in time...

28:49.500 --> 28:50.667
Uh, Chuck?

28:50.734 --> 28:51.934
Please, Sarah, let me get this off my chest.

28:52.002 --> 28:53.669
Okay, at least I can live knowing

28:53.737 --> 28:55.104
that I told you everything about how I felt.

28:55.171 --> 28:56.872
You owe me that. No. Chuck...

28:59.775 --> 29:01.776
And I owed you that.

29:38.895 --> 29:40.197
Oh, Javier.

29:41.065 --> 29:43.500
Uh, you know, I think we actually got off

29:43.568 --> 29:44.835
on the wrong foot.

29:44.902 --> 29:46.603
Truth be told, I'm a huge
fan of mariachi music.

29:46.670 --> 29:49.705
And my hitting you was
completely unintentional.

29:50.273 --> 29:52.074
I want to know who you are.

29:52.141 --> 29:53.608
Nobody. I'm nobody.

29:53.676 --> 29:56.008
In fact, I think that I
have documentation somewhere

29:56.076 --> 29:58.339
that-that proves that
I'm an official nobody.

29:58.407 --> 30:00.704
Wow. You are extremely ripped, sir.

30:00.770 --> 30:03.505
You hit me very well outside the club.

30:06.275 --> 30:08.276
Try that again.

30:09.511 --> 30:11.378
Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

30:13.581 --> 30:15.948
Shh. Freaking flash. Come on!

30:16.016 --> 30:17.115
If you could just give me one second.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.760
You're going to tell me everything,
Mr. Bartowski.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.161
All the secrets you know.

30:30.228 --> 30:34.197
Who you are, who you work for.

30:34.265 --> 30:37.367
And then, you're going to
tell me about the girl.

30:41.104 --> 30:43.037
<i>For now, you should go to Prague,</i>

30:43.105 --> 30:45.039
<i>and then meet me at the
Nadrazi train station</i>

30:45.107 --> 30:46.674
in three weeks' time at 7:00,

30:46.742 --> 30:49.376
<i>and then we can figure the rest out
later.</i>

31:02.556 --> 31:05.057
* *

31:16.234 --> 31:18.835
Here is your ticket and your new passport.

31:18.903 --> 31:20.737
Your name is Hector Caldaron.

31:20.804 --> 31:22.438
Sarah, wait. We have plenty of time to talk

31:22.505 --> 31:24.172
on the train. Right now we have to act fast.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.874
Trust me, Chuck.
It's all going to work out fine.

31:44.856 --> 31:48.325
That's not the kiss that I was expecting.

31:50.494 --> 31:52.095
Sarah, there is an entire facility here

31:52.163 --> 31:54.931
dedicated and designed to
turning me into Intersect 2.0.

31:54.998 --> 31:56.298
I mean, think about it.

31:56.366 --> 31:57.666
Think about that.

31:57.734 --> 32:00.134
Me, a real spy, you know,
living a life of adventure,

32:00.202 --> 32:01.804
and doing things that really matter.

32:01.872 --> 32:03.039
It's not that simple.

32:03.107 --> 32:05.241
You don't know who you're working for.

32:05.308 --> 32:06.909
It's complicated. Nothing is real.

32:06.976 --> 32:08.410
This...

32:10.179 --> 32:11.913
This is simple.

32:11.981 --> 32:14.082
This is a real life.

32:16.318 --> 32:18.519
We have to go, Chuck. This is it.

32:18.587 --> 32:20.721
Are you coming?

32:22.690 --> 32:24.724
* *

32:43.441 --> 32:45.575
I can't.

32:48.645 --> 32:51.446
I'm sorr

32:54.482 --> 32:56.483
I'm sorry.

33:01.921 --> 33:03.521
<i>Any sign of Walker?</i>

33:03.589 --> 33:05.223
<i>Last ping had her at the Buy More.</i>

33:13.463 --> 33:15.797
You gotta be kidding me.

33:15.864 --> 33:17.665
I want a real-time satellite
trace on every car

33:17.733 --> 33:19.033
that's been in the Buy More parking lot

33:19.101 --> 33:20.602
in the last six hours. Do it.

33:20.669 --> 33:22.070
Get the chopper read Sir,
on whose authority?

33:22.137 --> 33:24.238
Mine.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.473
The Colonel.

33:26.541 --> 33:28.475
Come on, Chuck. You can do this.

33:28.543 --> 33:30.744
Just one flash of kung fu

33:30.811 --> 33:33.646
and we are out of here.

33:35.648 --> 33:37.579
I'm dead.

33:37.647 --> 33:40.580
I'm so completely dead.

33:40.648 --> 33:42.448
What am I going to do?

33:42.516 --> 33:44.483
Chuck. Chuck,

33:44.551 --> 33:46.318
can you hear me?

33:46.385 --> 33:47.819
Sarah?

33:47.887 --> 33:49.820
I need you to break out of
your cell and come and get me.

33:49.888 --> 33:51.488
I couldn't pick this stupid lock!

33:51.556 --> 33:53.056
There's no way

33:53.124 --> 33:54.927
Chuck. that we could reverse
those roles, is there?

33:54.994 --> 33:56.933
You can do this.
You've been trained to do this.

33:57.001 --> 33:58.136
The Intersect can do this.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.172
Sarah, you don't get it.

33:59.239 --> 34:00.441
You and Casey were right, okay.

34:00.508 --> 34:01.475
I'm-I'm a lemon.

34:01.543 --> 34:02.509
I don't work.

34:02.577 --> 34:05.645
My emotions just mess everything up.

34:05.713 --> 34:07.146
No.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.114
Chuck, listen, I was mad...

34:09.181 --> 34:10.149
and wrong.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.583
And ever since you went to Prague,

34:11.650 --> 34:13.217
I have worked with the
best spies in the world.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.318
And you know what?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.454
They're on their way here to save us?

34:16.521 --> 34:19.456
None of them can do what you can do.

34:19.524 --> 34:20.524
You're a spy.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.926
Now flash on Javier and get us out of here.

34:25.661 --> 34:26.829
Something's happening here, Sarah.

34:26.897 --> 34:27.864
Chuck.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.266
Don't freak out.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.839
When I'm done with you,

34:40.906 --> 34:43.541
I'm going to deal with her.

34:43.609 --> 34:44.909
The girl.

34:50.215 --> 34:51.915
Me first.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.421
Chuck?

34:59.489 --> 35:02.022
What happened?

35:03.258 --> 35:06.693
Something... awesome!

35:08.562 --> 35:09.729
Thank you.

35:16.503 --> 35:18.270
Let's go. No. Hey, you should've seen it.

35:18.338 --> 35:19.604
I knocked him out with one punch.

35:19.672 --> 35:21.238
One punch. That's great. Let's talk and run.

35:21.306 --> 35:23.305
<i>Where are we?</i>

35:37.452 --> 35:39.352
Chuck, I'm almost out. We need to get off

35:39.420 --> 35:40.787
this roof.

35:52.766 --> 35:54.900
What are you doing?

35:54.968 --> 35:56.001
Zip line.

35:56.937 --> 35:57.803
It'll work. I promise.

35:57.871 --> 36:00.106
Okay. I trust you.

36:02.542 --> 36:05.510
Hold on tight.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.787
I...

36:17.854 --> 36:19.121
I can't believe that worked!

36:19.189 --> 36:21.089
I'm not so sure it did.

36:36.001 --> 36:38.235
Sarah... there's something
I need to tell you.

36:38.303 --> 36:39.270
Not now, Chuck.

36:40.672 --> 36:42.505
Actually, I think this
might be my last chance.

36:54.549 --> 36:55.649
Oh, get down!

37:34.560 --> 37:36.360
Javier Cruz was a vital operative

37:36.427 --> 37:37.960
for The Ring's Mexico Syndicate.

37:38.028 --> 37:39.462
The device you picked up

37:39.529 --> 37:41.631
is a custom smart phone for Ring operatives.

37:41.698 --> 37:43.866
This is the first one we have ever captured.

37:43.933 --> 37:45.901
Hey, good job, Team Bartowski.

37:45.968 --> 37:47.302
General, Colonel Casey and I

37:47.370 --> 37:48.837
will be departing for Lisbon tonight.

37:48.904 --> 37:50.038
There's been chatter

37:50.105 --> 37:51.305
that another Ring cell is operating there.

37:51.373 --> 37:53.274
That won't be necessary.

37:54.376 --> 37:55.542
Why not?

37:55.610 --> 37:57.844
I can't believe I'm about to say this...

37:57.912 --> 37:58.612
Say it.

37:59.613 --> 38:00.680
I mean...

38:01.982 --> 38:03.548
:...please say it.

38:03.616 --> 38:07.920
I'm putting Operation
Bartowski back into the field.

38:07.988 --> 38:09.021
Yes!

38:09.089 --> 38:10.756
Casey, Sarah,

38:10.823 --> 38:13.258
you will work alongside Agent Bartowski

38:13.325 --> 38:14.758
to bring down the Ring.

38:14.826 --> 38:16.093
That is all.

38:17.561 --> 38:18.528
This is great!

38:18.596 --> 38:20.096
This is great. Come on, guys.

38:20.164 --> 38:22.631
The three of us, the old gang,
back together again.

38:22.699 --> 38:23.699
I cannot wait.

38:23.766 --> 38:24.866
Hey, what's my new cover going to be?

38:24.934 --> 38:25.900
'Cause I-I need a new job.

38:25.968 --> 38:27.067
Can it be something exciting?

38:27.135 --> 38:28.102
Race car driver?

38:28.169 --> 38:29.703
Hmm?

38:29.771 --> 38:31.705
It's gotta be something cool.

38:31.773 --> 38:33.240
* *

38:35.676 --> 38:37.277
Oh, wow.

38:37.345 --> 38:40.113
I can't believe you got me
this job back so quickly.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.714
Yeah, well, with no manager,

38:41.782 --> 38:43.415
the paperwork was easy to push through.

38:43.483 --> 38:45.781
So, Emmett really took a
Large Mart job in Anchorage?

38:45.848 --> 38:47.714
. Well, good for him.

38:47.781 --> 38:50.850
Oh, also, thanks for doing that extra favor.

38:50.918 --> 38:52.551
What?

38:52.619 --> 38:54.552
I speak of the bearded one.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.554
MORGAN : We're back!

38:56.621 --> 38:58.856
Up high.

39:00.925 --> 39:02.358
There he goes.

39:02.426 --> 39:04.026
There he goes. He's busy.

39:04.094 --> 39:05.694
Work, work, work, that guy.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.696
Are you ready for this?
Someone from corporate called me

39:07.763 --> 39:09.730
and pretty much begged
me to take my job back.

39:09.798 --> 39:11.065
Did they? I'm serious.

39:11.133 --> 39:13.367
I guess they know talent.

39:13.435 --> 39:16.102
They do indeed, my friend.

39:18.138 --> 39:20.239
<i>Sarah, I need you</i>

39:20.307 --> 39:23.140
to keep Chuck's emotions in
check so the Intersect can work.

39:23.208 --> 39:26.309
He listens to you,
but halso an unstable element.

39:26.377 --> 39:27.877
Do you think he's dangerous?

39:27.944 --> 39:31.446
Very, but he's worth the risk.

39:31.514 --> 39:34.448
For the last two years,
we protected Chuck from the world.

39:34.516 --> 39:38.018
But, now, we have to protect
the world from Chuck.

39:43.323 --> 39:46.758
Hey, do we really need all this stuff?

39:46.826 --> 39:48.660
Oh, hey, guys.

39:48.728 --> 39:50.161
Hey, Devon.

39:50.229 --> 39:51.796
Hey, El. What's happening?

39:51.864 --> 39:54.165
Uh, well, we're moving.

39:54.232 --> 39:55.666
Yeah, the, uh, the apartment

39:55.734 --> 39:57.101
across the courtyard opened up. So,

39:57.168 --> 39:58.335
we're taking it.

40:01.305 --> 40:04.307
We needed a place for two
and you can get a roommate.

40:04.374 --> 40:06.308
You know? You have plenty of friends.

40:06.376 --> 40:08.076
I'm so happy right now.

40:08.144 --> 40:10.145
Other friends, Chuck.

40:10.212 --> 40:12.180
Other friends.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.983
Uh... listen to me, listen to me. Two words.

40:16.050 --> 40:17.684
Bachelor pad.

40:17.752 --> 40:18.818
Yes!

40:18.886 --> 40:19.819
I got dibs on Ellie's room.

40:19.887 --> 40:21.887
Okay.

40:23.289 --> 40:25.323
Chuck.

40:26.859 --> 40:29.026
We should talk.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.195
Absolutely.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.970
I'll go first. I'll go first. Sure.

40:46.541 --> 40:48.541
Sarah, they wanted me to be a spy, okay.

40:49.576 --> 40:51.544
They told me

40:51.578 --> 40:53.979
that I could make a difference.

40:56.015 --> 40:57.616
For years, I been... I been kicking around

40:57.683 --> 40:59.283
not knowing what I wanted to do with my life

40:59.351 --> 41:00.551
like a... like a loser.

41:03.455 --> 41:05.389
that they thoughtreally I
could change the world.

41:05.457 --> 41:07.190
Me. Chuck Bartowski.

41:09.226 --> 41:10.493
It was never about you...

41:10.561 --> 41:11.661
Stop.

41:14.998 --> 41:16.965
I acted impulsively.

41:17.033 --> 41:20.034
And it's a mistake I don't usually make.

41:21.069 --> 41:22.369
And it won't happen again.

41:22.437 --> 41:24.404
But, Sarah...

41:24.472 --> 41:26.339
You're a spy now, Chuck.

41:28.441 --> 41:30.542
You have to keep your feelings to yourself.

41:38.650 --> 41:39.816
Numbnuts.

41:39.884 --> 41:40.851
Ready?

41:40.918 --> 41:43.186
Ready for what?

41:43.254 --> 41:45.187
Your training. Come on.

41:47.624 --> 41:49.024
* *

41:51.961 --> 41:53.895
You have much to learn, grasshopper.

41:59.434 --> 42:00.867
Have you flashed yet?

42:02.136 --> 42:03.269
Take a breath.

42:08.174 --> 42:10.375
Let's do this.
