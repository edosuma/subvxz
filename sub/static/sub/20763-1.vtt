01:03.083 --> 01:06.083
<i>Tocopilla</i>

01:11.041 --> 01:12.958
<i>This tremor,</i>

01:13.166 --> 01:15.250
<i>this stunning,</i>

01:15.875 --> 01:18.250
<i>this sliding towards the abyss...</i>

01:18.666 --> 01:20.875
<i>the distant and the never.</i>

01:22.583 --> 01:26.000
<i>I lost my mountains and
their tangy scent.</i>

01:26.583 --> 01:28.208
<i>I lost my ocean</i>

01:28.416 --> 01:30.875
<i>and its swarms of seagulls.</i>

01:31.208 --> 01:35.916
<i>From Tocopilla to Santiago, two
thousand kilometers of tears,</i>

01:36.833 --> 01:40.416
<i>listening to my
dreams falling apart.</i>

01:44.333 --> 01:49.791
I landed Matucana Street,
now in decadence,

01:50.375 --> 01:52.125
but at the time,

01:52.333 --> 01:55.541
the main artery of a
working-class neighborhood.

02:58.541 --> 03:00.291
<i>War! War!</i>

03:04.000 --> 03:05.291
El Combate makes war

03:05.500 --> 03:06.875
to the dear life!

03:19.208 --> 03:20.166
You're late.

03:20.708 --> 03:21.625
Sorry, Dad.

03:21.791 --> 03:24.791
A drunkard was stabbed, he
had the guts in the air.

03:25.041 --> 03:27.166
And to you, have you stabbed your legs?

03:27.458 --> 03:28.500
What day is it?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.791
Saturday!
The day you fill up with customers.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.500
You should have been on time!

03:38.666 --> 03:39.833
Listening,

03:40.083 --> 03:44.291
These lousy ones pretend to be
unhappy, but they are thieves.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.708
If you see them fly,
make me a gesture.

03:55.041 --> 03:55.875
Thieves!

03:57.333 --> 03:58.333
Thieves!

04:03.333 --> 04:05.791
Bug it! He knows he is guilty,
he will not defend himself.

04:05.958 --> 04:08.875
- I can not do that!
- No pity in me!

04:09.041 --> 04:10.458
I'm telling you to hit him!

04:16.541 --> 04:18.041
Again! Again !

04:19.000 --> 04:20.083
Strike harder!

04:22.083 --> 04:23.708
Look!

04:26.458 --> 04:27.875
A thief!

04:49.958 --> 04:50.833
Clear!

04:56.833 --> 04:59.416
That's what the thieves are waiting for here!

05:03.333 --> 05:04.375
Very good.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.500
Come on, it's over, move on.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.375
Come on.

05:11.458 --> 05:14.333
<i>Jaime, I thought you had changed</i>

05:15.000 --> 05:17.333
<i>but you stayed the same</i>

05:17.500 --> 05:18.666
<i>You do not like to dominate</i>

05:18.916 --> 05:19.916
And what?

05:20.416 --> 05:22.916
I work as a convict
to feed the family!

05:23.083 --> 05:24.750
I should be flying?

05:24.958 --> 05:28.625
<i>Let's calm down</i>

05:29.625 --> 05:32.083
<i>My mother comes today to drink the maté</i>

05:32.250 --> 05:34.541
<i>and eat strawberry cake</i>

05:34.791 --> 05:37.500
<i>My very holy mother!</i>

05:40.000 --> 05:42.208
Again?
I am fed up with this life !

05:43.500 --> 05:44.458
Congratulations!

05:45.083 --> 05:46.500
El Combate settles his account

05:46.750 --> 05:48.500
not only to thieves,

05:48.791 --> 05:50.708
but also to the expensive life!

05:54.958 --> 05:57.708
It stinks of soot and excrement here.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.916
How can you live like this?

06:01.583 --> 06:04.750
<i>The nose is getting used to, Mom</i>

06:05.375 --> 06:08.375
<i>One day, with the help of God</i>

06:08.833 --> 06:12.791
<i>We will have an elegant
shop in the center.</i>

06:15.958 --> 06:19.416
<i>Sit down and drink a mate</i>

06:25.708 --> 06:27.833
This is your brother's birthday.

06:28.708 --> 06:32.375
<i>I never forget it, mother</i>

06:38.875 --> 06:41.375
Ah, José...

06:42.583 --> 06:46.208
How could you die suffocated?  by a piece of strawberry cake?

06:46.375 --> 06:50.166
Calm yourself

06:58.750 --> 07:01.250
<i>Calm yourself</i>

07:01.916 --> 07:04.291
<i>You have suffered far too many years</i>

07:09.416 --> 07:13.500
<i>Pretty, Mom</i>

07:14.333 --> 07:16.000
<i>I will return you</i>

07:16.250 --> 07:18.416
<i>The son you lost</i>

07:18.791 --> 07:22.625
<i>"Green and I want you green." "Green wind."  "The boat on the sea, the horse on the mountain.</i>

07:29.083 --> 07:33.125
"The shadow around the belt, she dreams at her balcony,

07:33.375 --> 07:36.375
" green flesh, green hair,
with cold silver eyes.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.541
" Below the gypsy moon,

07:50.791 --> 07:54.583
"all things look at her but she can not see
them." = = "Green and I want you green.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.166
"Green and I want you green."

07:58.333 --> 08:00.458
García Lorca!

08:05.375 --> 08:06.625
That one, it speaks of love, but it is a fagot!

08:07.208 --> 08:10.041
Like all the poets, all the
painters, the dancers,

08:10.500 --> 08:15.000
the actors...

08:15.250 --> 08:16.375
If you keep reading these dirt,

08:16.583 --> 08:18.291
you will become fagot like him!

08:18.500 --> 08:20.375
Sale shit.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.333
Instead, read your books on biology.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.333
My son must become a great doctor.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.916
Yes, Dad.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.291
Men do not cry.

08:44.125 --> 08:48.000
<i>Alejandrito I bring you
this precious gift</i>

08:50.458 --> 08:53.458
<i>Your grandmother entrusted me
the violin Of his son José</i>

08:53.666 --> 08:55.875
<i>Peace to His Soul</i>

08:56.791 --> 08:59.666
<i>It would make her so happy</i>

08:59.916 --> 09:04.125
<i>What you learn to play From
this venerable instrument</i>

09:04.708 --> 09:05.791
<i>Open it</i>

09:09.041 --> 09:10.583
<i>You will take lessons</i>

09:10.833 --> 09:13.375
<i>At the Conservatory of Music</i>

09:13.625 --> 09:14.375
More...

09:16.416 --> 09:17.916
It looks like a coffin!

09:18.166 --> 09:19.416
<i>But what do you say?</i>

09:25.333 --> 09:27.541
- He carries a dead man!
- A dead person !

09:27.708 --> 09:29.583
- It smells rotten!
- The rotten!

09:29.833 --> 09:32.416
- It's a dead man!
- A dead man!

09:36.125 --> 09:38.000
Shut up, shit!

09:58.000 --> 10:00.666
Do not worry, my boy.

10:01.416 --> 10:06.375
A nude virgin will light your path

10:06.625 --> 10:09.750
with a fiery butterfly.

10:11.666 --> 10:13.000
<i>This drunk,</i>

10:13.250 --> 10:16.125
converted into a prophet by wine,

10:16.708 --> 10:18.500
in one sentence

10:18.666 --> 10:20.750
pulled me from the abyss.

10:22.583 --> 10:26.208
"A nude virgin will illuminate your path... "... with a fiery butterfly. " Quickly, Jaime They are going to kill

10:26.833 --> 10:28.958
We do not give a damn, For nothing,
You guard the money. = = I keep it

10:46.875 --> 10:49.250
<i>Advance</i>

10:49.416 --> 10:50.208
"The flower sings, and disappears.

11:08.416 --> 11:09.125
Gay!

11:09.333 --> 11:11.458
I stop seeing the world
through your eyes.

11:11.708 --> 11:12.916
"Nocturnal rain,

11:14.208 --> 11:15.166
" empty house. " Gone! " My traces on the way, fade away little by little.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.375
"The flower sings, and disappears..."

11:16.625 --> 11:21.083
Gay!

11:24.666 --> 11:26.416
"How can we complain about it?"  "Nocturnal rain, empty house.

11:26.583 --> 11:27.500
"My tracks on the way, gradually fade away."

11:27.666 --> 11:29.666
Poetry,

11:30.583 --> 11:33.583
You will illuminate my way, like a fiery butterfly.

11:34.375 --> 11:38.583
Good evening, papa.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.250
Good evening, Mom.

11:46.208 --> 11:50.625
Good evening, Alejandrito

12:11.458 --> 12:14.125
<i>Tomorrow, Sunday We'll
go to my mother's house</i>

12:14.375 --> 12:16.625
<i>I promised him a cake</i>

12:17.291 --> 12:19.333
<i>I go to the kitchen to prepare it</i>

12:19.541 --> 12:21.291
<i>Get Rid of Dinner</i>

12:44.916 --> 12:46.583
Disinfect this filth.

12:50.458 --> 12:51.750
Leave it and come here.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.333
I have...

13:12.458 --> 13:14.291
something important to tell you.

13:16.958 --> 13:18.791
Something important? You?

13:21.083 --> 13:21.833
Save me!

13:24.083 --> 13:25.666
We're going to die!

13:26.083 --> 13:29.250
<i>I promised her a cake!</i>

13:29.833 --> 13:31.000
Calm down!

13:33.083 --> 13:34.916
What a coward, but what a coward!

13:35.625 --> 13:37.291
<i>My God!</i>

13:41.958 --> 13:44.041
Do not let fear dominate you!

13:44.291 --> 13:45.791
This is just an earthquake.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.375
Come on.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.708
Leave this!

13:59.875 --> 14:01.000
Come here.

14:03.291 --> 14:04.875
As cowardly as their dogs!

14:07.208 --> 14:08.166
The fear

14:08.375 --> 14:09.708
worsens the damage.

14:09.958 --> 14:12.875
Your mind is stronger
than any earthquake.

14:15.458 --> 14:18.041
Come on, be brave:
laugh with me!

14:29.083 --> 14:30.041
You see?

14:30.833 --> 14:31.916
It was nothing.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.041
Let's count the money.

14:41.875 --> 14:44.500
What were you telling
me just now?

14:46.083 --> 14:48.000
It was not important.

14:49.958 --> 14:52.791
<i>God be praised</i>

14:53.041 --> 14:57.000
<i>He saved the cake From
my venerable mother</i>

15:02.333 --> 15:03.458
Hello, Sara.

15:04.000 --> 15:04.916
Jaime.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.791
Hello, small.
You remember me ?

15:07.041 --> 15:08.541
You are my uncle Isidoro.

15:08.791 --> 15:11.458
You grew well.
I knew you little like that.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.125
You were big like that,

15:13.333 --> 15:15.333
and you were chasing me
with an insecticide bomb,

15:15.583 --> 15:17.125
threatening to fuck
me in the ass!

15:17.333 --> 15:20.000
<i>Alejandrito, what a lack of respect!</i>

15:20.250 --> 15:22.041
It does not matter.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.750
We make peace?

15:27.083 --> 15:29.208
Your body has grown
but not your brain.

15:29.416 --> 15:30.916
Still as stupid as before.

15:31.916 --> 15:34.375
Go, enter. The old ones are waiting for you.

15:38.541 --> 15:43.083
<i>Hello to all, venerable mother</i>

15:43.708 --> 15:45.708
What does that mean, Sara?

15:45.875 --> 15:47.833
I taught you to be on time!

15:48.083 --> 15:51.708
<i>Here's the promised cake</i>

15:52.333 --> 15:55.166
Oh no, my sister,
that's forbidden.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.208
You know very well that
Mom is starting diabetes.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.750
Let me taste it.

16:02.083 --> 16:05.916
It's not possible!
There is more sugar than chocolate!

16:06.375 --> 16:08.250
Fanny, in the trash!

16:17.583 --> 16:21.083
Calm down, my child.

16:21.916 --> 16:24.333
You do not know how to play cards.

16:24.541 --> 16:26.250
Look, on the chair,

16:26.416 --> 16:29.041
there's the scarf that
you started to make me.

16:29.791 --> 16:31.625
Sit down and finish it.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.791
And you, what are you going to study?

16:38.041 --> 16:39.541
- I...
- Medicine!

16:39.708 --> 16:41.458
My son is going to do medicine.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.250
Very good!

16:43.458 --> 16:45.333
I'm not going to do medicine.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.041
I will be a poet!

16:48.208 --> 16:49.833
You're going to starve.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.333
No one is going to die of hunger, Naum.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.750
Like Isidoro, Alejandrito
likes to joke.

16:56.958 --> 16:58.541
You were joking, were not you?

16:59.916 --> 17:00.958
I was joking.

17:01.791 --> 17:02.500
Good,

17:02.750 --> 17:05.665
so you do not get
bored, go to the garden

17:05.915 --> 17:08.208
and feed the pigeons.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.165
Old shit...

17:16.833 --> 17:19.500
What do you say?
It's enough ?

17:19.750 --> 17:20.750
Getting started.

17:38.541 --> 17:41.791
Shit!

17:47.291 --> 17:48.458
Give me three.

17:50.041 --> 17:50.833
Servie.

17:51.083 --> 17:51.833
None.

17:53.041 --> 17:53.875
I pass.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.000
I pass.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.083
Let's see?

18:03.041 --> 18:04.541
Four kings.

18:05.791 --> 18:06.708
Square of aces!

18:06.875 --> 18:07.916
What?

18:08.458 --> 18:10.208
Here, still lost, Jaime!

18:10.541 --> 18:12.208
And one who loses, pays.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.708
Shit family!

18:17.000 --> 18:19.375
In the ass!

18:22.000 --> 18:23.500
What are these cries?

18:23.916 --> 18:26.666
This bandit is cutting the tree!

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Our tree!

18:34.041 --> 18:35.958
Shit family!

18:41.583 --> 18:43.208
- <i> Alejandrito!
</i> - Alejandrito!

18:44.416 --> 18:47.375
Out of here, wild.
Never come back!

18:49.583 --> 18:51.208
Shit!

18:54.083 --> 18:55.750
<i>Why my house?</i>

18:55.916 --> 18:57.875
<i>Why my tree?</i>

19:05.833 --> 19:07.500
Wait!

19:08.458 --> 19:11.041
Alejandro, I'm amazed.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.416
Your act of rebellion
is worthy of a poet.

19:14.375 --> 19:16.750
Without saying anything, you said everything.

19:19.791 --> 19:21.708
Are you going to go home tonight?

19:21.916 --> 19:24.583
No, my mother would jump in my face!

19:24.750 --> 19:27.833
Do not worry. Come to the Cereceda sisters.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.250
Are you coming?

19:31.291 --> 19:32.375
Let's go!

19:33.000 --> 19:36.500
This is the home of my friends,
Carmen and Verónica Cereceda.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.041
Come on.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.250
I have never seen their parents.

19:41.416 --> 19:44.333
I do not know if they are
orphans or millionaires,

19:44.500 --> 19:47.375
but I know they love
art above all else.

20:05.625 --> 20:06.291
Carmen!

20:07.500 --> 20:09.125
I bring you a new friend.

20:11.291 --> 20:13.333
Good evening, Ricardo.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.333
- I do not want to disturb.
- But no, darling,

20:16.541 --> 20:19.666
an artist can enter
here at any time.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.208
Verónica!

20:27.625 --> 20:28.500
Ricardo!

20:29.333 --> 20:31.125
Who are you bringing us, Ricardo?

20:31.291 --> 20:32.666
It's Alejandro.

20:32.833 --> 20:36.041
A sublime soul, a future great artist.

20:37.541 --> 20:38.666
Let's see.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.875
Good! You have a beautiful skeleton.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.750
You would make a good model.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.791
What is your art, Alejandro?

20:51.041 --> 20:52.166
I write poems.

20:52.416 --> 20:53.875
You know one by heart?

20:54.041 --> 20:54.958
No.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.416
But you're a poet. Improvise!

20:57.625 --> 20:59.458
You cut the tree. You can.

21:04.708 --> 21:08.083
"The Being that dwells in me is consumed,"  "flaming from dreams."  Come, Alejandro. = = Look!  = = Antique hero, he cut his family tree.  It is a wonderful boy.

21:54.125 --> 21:57.458
It is a unique being.
It is so beautiful !

21:57.666 --> 22:00.791
Yes, but this beautiful being
is a man, Ricardo. A man !

22:01.250 --> 22:04.041
I'm wrong or is
that what I think?

22:06.833 --> 22:08.041
That's right.

22:09.708 --> 22:10.583
That's right?

22:10.750 --> 22:11.500
That's right?

22:11.708 --> 22:13.375
Yes, it's true.

22:15.708 --> 22:18.041
But this boy is still innocent.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.041
Do not make him believe that
your love is friendship.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.666
I would like to live without a mask.

22:25.291 --> 22:27.375
But I am the son of Naum.

22:27.666 --> 22:31.000
I have to become an architect,
get married, have children...

22:31.250 --> 22:32.250
Ose, Ricardo!

22:32.458 --> 22:34.708
The scandal would kill my father.

22:37.916 --> 22:39.666
Remove your mask.

22:42.458 --> 22:43.416
Ose.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.375
Dare!

22:47.250 --> 22:48.583
Ose, Ricardo!

22:49.791 --> 22:50.958
Dare!

22:51.208 --> 22:52.750
Ose, Ricardo!

22:54.041 --> 22:54.708
Yes.

22:56.083 --> 22:56.791
Yes.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.041
Thank you.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.250
Punto!

23:03.708 --> 23:04.583
Hi, you.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.791
Between, Ricardo.
You do not bother me.

23:15.958 --> 23:17.000
Do you like it here?

23:17.541 --> 23:20.250
Thanks to you, I have
never been so happy.

23:20.583 --> 23:22.666
I could write quiet. Listening:

23:23.916 --> 23:25.791
"I do not fear my shadow, my goal is to return to what I have always been."  That is beautiful. summer".

23:40.375 --> 23:41.791
No, never.

23:43.541 --> 23:44.666
And you masturbate?

23:44.833 --> 23:45.708
Yes.

23:45.875 --> 23:49.333
And you think of men, or women?

23:49.500 --> 23:50.916
To women, of course.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.708
Me, I think of men.

23:55.041 --> 23:56.666
To beautiful men like you.

23:58.833 --> 24:00.583
Can I tell you something?

24:00.958 --> 24:02.125
You like me.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.500
In fact, I love you.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.166
Sorry, Ricardo.

24:08.541 --> 24:09.541
Moi...

24:10.416 --> 24:12.375
I'm not like that.

24:14.375 --> 24:15.541
That's what I feared.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.083
More...

24:18.000 --> 24:19.458
we can be friends.

24:21.583 --> 24:22.750
Impossible.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.875
You should hide my erections.

24:26.333 --> 24:29.125
Then there is no solution.

24:30.625 --> 24:33.541
Farewell, Alejandro.
We will never see each other again.

24:35.250 --> 24:36.541
I'm sorry.

24:39.125 --> 24:41.750
You would give me
a kiss, remember?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.500
I owe you so much.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.500
Agree.

25:10.791 --> 25:12.625
Did you feel anything?

25:16.000 --> 25:16.625
Nothing.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.541
I did not feel anything!

25:34.708 --> 25:37.333
I'm not fagot.
I told you, papa!

25:38.583 --> 25:40.125
<i>I felt free.</i>

25:40.375 --> 25:41.500
<i>I grew up.</i>

25:41.666 --> 25:42.916
<i>Standing, poet!</i>

25:43.166 --> 25:44.291
Arise!

25:45.125 --> 25:47.041
I've been up a long time.

25:47.208 --> 25:49.291
Come and meet your brothers.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.583
What brothers?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.375
Come on. Follow me.

25:56.166 --> 26:00.541
You will meet Cana and
Gordo, symbiotic dancers.

26:12.208 --> 26:15.041
Alberto Rubio, supra-tenor.

26:27.666 --> 26:30.833
Gustavo Becerra, ultra-pianist.

26:46.458 --> 26:49.583
Your brother Hugo Marín, poly-painter.

27:13.291 --> 27:15.416
This miracle we call chance,

27:15.791 --> 27:17.625
sent us this poet:

27:18.333 --> 27:19.958
Alejandro Jodorowsky.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.708
Let us welcome him!

27:25.500 --> 27:28.666
We will not let you go
until you say a poem.

27:28.958 --> 27:31.625
"To be neither one nor the other.

27:32.458 --> 27:34.541
" To lose one and a thousand skins,

27:35.416 --> 27:39.000
"consume the superfluous
in a feast of flames;

27:39.375 --> 27:43.916
"be carried away by the
wind in a swarm of petals."

27:49.333 --> 27:51.333
Poet!

27:52.750 --> 27:56.791
I sold my devil to the soul!

27:58.458 --> 27:59.750
Then, Alejandro,

28:00.583 --> 28:02.208
Who is this puppet?

28:03.750 --> 28:06.125
You made me read the
<i> Odes,</i> of Pablo Neruda,

28:06.333 --> 28:08.541
and the <i> Antipoemes,</i>
of Nicanor Parra.

28:08.916 --> 28:10.458
It's Parra that I prefer.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.958
It is not a supreme
God, like Neruda.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.208
It is a human being,
with sublime weaknesses.

28:17.666 --> 28:19.666
I have the honor to present you

28:20.000 --> 28:23.625
a great poet: Nicanor Parra!

28:27.083 --> 28:31.583
"For many years, I was condemned
to worship a despicable woman

28:31.750 --> 28:36.083
"to work day and night,

28:36.333 --> 28:38.333
" to feed and clothe her,

28:38.541 --> 28:41.458
"to commit various larcenies

28:41.666 --> 28:44.041
" in the light of the moon.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.791
"I flew for her,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.416
" under pain of being discredited

28:49.875 --> 28:52.958
"to his fascinating eyes."

28:53.125 --> 28:56.875
Leave me alone!

29:02.375 --> 29:03.375
It was very fun.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.083
Take this money.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.458
Why Money?
I have everything I need here.

29:16.666 --> 29:19.500
But here you will not find a muse

29:24.916 --> 29:26.458
<i>Go to Café Iris.</i>

29:26.708 --> 29:29.708
<i>Poets and muses meet
there every night.</i>

29:29.875 --> 29:32.000
<i>You may encounter yours here.</i>

30:09.000 --> 30:10.500
A beer, please.

30:16.291 --> 30:17.333
Thank you.

30:23.750 --> 30:26.708
You all are nothing!

30:31.625 --> 30:32.791
My two liters!

31:29.166 --> 31:30.958
Do you know this woman?

31:31.208 --> 31:33.958
This is Stella Díaz, a poet.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.833
Prudence, young man.

31:38.375 --> 31:41.291
You all are nothing!

32:43.000 --> 32:44.833
Stop!

32:45.208 --> 32:46.125
Thank you.

32:52.375 --> 32:55.291
Yes. I follow you.

32:55.916 --> 32:56.958
Hit me.

32:57.541 --> 32:59.000
Open your eyes.

33:03.666 --> 33:06.000
They say you write poems.

33:06.166 --> 33:07.583
Me too, I write.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.666
Could I have the
honor to read them?

33:10.916 --> 33:13.291
Only my poems interest you?

33:13.541 --> 33:14.916
Not my ass and my breasts?

33:15.458 --> 33:18.166
No, it's that...
I'm not interested...

33:18.333 --> 33:19.833
Show me your sex.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.833
- My sex?
- Your sex.

33:24.708 --> 33:26.875
- Here in the street?
- Now.

33:36.708 --> 33:38.375
You are a virgin.

33:38.666 --> 33:42.291
You are pure, like a
romantic pierrot.

33:44.583 --> 33:45.500
Come on.

33:47.458 --> 33:50.083
Here you are, your portrait.

34:08.875 --> 34:10.000
I love you.

34:10.666 --> 34:12.250
I need you.

34:12.916 --> 34:14.541
I am yours.

34:15.166 --> 34:19.416
You will illuminate my way
with a fiery butterfly.

34:25.750 --> 34:26.833
Thank you.

34:38.666 --> 34:42.833
"The woman who loved the doves like a virgin in ecstasy, at night, suckled the lilies with her sleeping bosom.

34:44.041 --> 34:47.166
"dreaming leaning against the wall"

34:47.541 --> 34:49.791
"and everything seemed beautiful, without being so."

34:49.958 --> 34:53.041
It's great!

34:53.208 --> 34:55.125
Yes, everything looks beautiful.

34:55.416 --> 34:58.166
This place is magic!

34:58.458 --> 35:00.625
Wake up, sir

35:00.791 --> 35:02.125
= = Mademoiselle!

35:28.250 --> 35:29.416
Farewell!

35:35.500 --> 35:37.333
Here is the pension where I live.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.666
Now I'll bite you.

35:54.166 --> 35:58.833
Do you want to see if I'm willing to
sacrifice a piece of ear to get you?

35:59.708 --> 36:01.125
I sacrifice myself.

36:13.416 --> 36:14.833
And shit!

36:15.375 --> 36:17.750
Get out of here, get out!

36:17.916 --> 36:19.750
Get out of here, shit!

36:20.541 --> 36:22.875
Did not you like my devil?

36:33.416 --> 36:35.458
You have talent, my boy.

36:35.625 --> 36:37.541
We'll get along.

36:44.083 --> 36:45.708
Now go to bed.

36:46.416 --> 36:47.458
Go away!

36:47.958 --> 36:49.583
Go, I'll find you tomorrow.

36:49.750 --> 36:51.416
At midnight, at the Café Iris.

36:51.750 --> 36:52.541
Go away.

36:52.791 --> 36:55.666
At midnight, at the Café Iris.

36:58.916 --> 37:00.083
Goodbye!

37:27.083 --> 37:28.583
A beer, please.

37:45.333 --> 37:46.416
Another.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.875
Another one.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.083
Let this Nicanor Parra be your master!

38:16.583 --> 38:19.708
You should not go with the...

38:19.875 --> 38:22.750
vulgar lousy like that.

38:23.500 --> 38:27.458
If you read his great poem <i> La
Viper,</i> you will see your portrait.

38:28.083 --> 38:29.750
Goodbye forever!

38:38.250 --> 38:39.833
You want to break my mouth?

38:40.000 --> 38:41.541
I take care of it myself!

38:55.250 --> 38:57.041
I'm much more than that.

39:03.125 --> 39:05.041
I am Nicanor Parra.

39:06.666 --> 39:09.458
And the one that inspired
my poem, <i> La Viper,</i>

39:12.083 --> 39:13.166
this is Stella.

39:38.375 --> 39:39.375
I give it to you.

39:59.833 --> 40:01.958
I'm sure you have a knife.

40:02.541 --> 40:03.708
Give it to me.

40:05.583 --> 40:07.375
This is to prune the pen

40:07.625 --> 40:08.833
with which I write.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Shut up.

40:10.791 --> 40:12.833
A poet does not have to justify himself.

40:15.291 --> 40:16.791
What's your name?

40:16.958 --> 40:18.166
Alejandro.

40:47.208 --> 40:49.625
We will not be separated.

40:50.833 --> 40:54.041
We will sleep by day
and live by night.

40:55.625 --> 40:59.541
I will write by scratching
the skin of your back.

40:59.708 --> 41:02.750
Through the pain, you
will understand my poems.

41:04.291 --> 41:05.958
I'm still a virgin.

41:08.083 --> 41:11.416
We will do everything
except penetration.

41:12.333 --> 41:16.208
I keep my hymen for the man
with the divine forehead

41:16.375 --> 41:19.125
who will descend from the mountains.

41:20.375 --> 41:22.041
You will feed me.

41:23.583 --> 41:26.708
I will allow you to
drink my saliva.

41:59.458 --> 42:00.666
From now on

42:01.708 --> 42:04.250
whenever we walk together,

42:06.041 --> 42:09.666
I will keep your
secret parts grabbed.

42:31.833 --> 42:33.000
Sit down.

42:34.833 --> 42:36.500
Remove your shoes.

42:39.041 --> 42:43.458
It's a pension for retirees,
they sleep until late.

42:44.750 --> 42:47.750
They grumble if a sound wakes them up.

43:32.416 --> 43:36.541
Orpheus, in the den of death,

43:37.416 --> 43:40.250
must not see naked his beloved.

43:56.750 --> 43:58.000
Your coat...

44:02.416 --> 44:03.708
Your skirt...

44:10.291 --> 44:11.541
Your shirt...

44:18.416 --> 44:19.416
Your corsage...

46:18.583 --> 46:22.625
<i>My love wanders in the streets</i>

46:23.416 --> 46:27.333
<i>I do not know when it will return</i>

46:28.458 --> 46:32.833
<i>Will it return for Easter</i>

46:33.875 --> 46:37.333
<i>or for the Trinity?</i>

46:37.666 --> 46:38.416
Sara.

46:40.791 --> 46:41.625
Come on.

47:18.666 --> 47:23.083
<i>The Past Trinity</i>

47:23.833 --> 47:28.250
<i>my love does not return anymore</i>

47:29.083 --> 47:33.541
<i>His mother who is waiting for her</i>

47:34.416 --> 47:39.375
<i>starts to sob</i>

47:44.791 --> 47:46.875
Everyone humiliates me.

47:50.416 --> 47:53.291
I wanted so much to
have a son doctor.

47:54.291 --> 47:55.916
Calm down, Jaime.

47:56.750 --> 47:59.541
My heart tells me that
Alejandrito will come back.

48:01.583 --> 48:03.958
That's all we have left to eat.

48:05.333 --> 48:08.333
Now you have to feed me.
You'll be able to ?

48:10.833 --> 48:11.708
I can.

48:12.791 --> 48:14.666
As Nicanor Parra says:

48:14.833 --> 48:18.333
"I will commit a small
larceny in the moonlight."

49:06.500 --> 49:07.583
Alejandrito?

49:07.833 --> 49:08.833
It's you?

49:09.291 --> 49:10.083
Yes, Dad.

49:10.708 --> 49:13.333
That's good. We were waiting for you.

49:15.041 --> 49:16.375
<i>Alejandrito</i>

49:16.833 --> 49:19.916
<i>Go to bed, sleep well</i>

49:20.083 --> 49:21.250
Yes, Mom.

49:36.125 --> 49:40.500
"To commit misdemeanors, some mistakes, " under penalty of falling in disgrace to your fascinating eyes. " You offer me the
Nirvana. There are there for three months of beer and Of empanadas, an eternity! = = Wait. Tell me, what is poetry for you?

50:16.916 --> 50:18.291
My little toad,

50:18.458 --> 50:22.166
I am a firefly far too
big for your mouth.

50:22.333 --> 50:24.000
I do not need to swallow you.

50:24.166 --> 50:25.833
You are my soul.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.833
A soul dead of thirst.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.041
Midnight!

50:29.208 --> 50:32.333
The Iris coffee must finally be opened.
Let's go!

50:50.458 --> 50:53.250
There is no service today.

50:53.583 --> 50:56.458
One of us died.

50:57.833 --> 50:59.541
Shit!

50:59.708 --> 51:02.000
My kingdom for a beer!

51:02.166 --> 51:05.625
There is a bar that only closes
at dawn, Le Perroquet Mute.

51:05.833 --> 51:06.666
Come on!

51:06.833 --> 51:09.250
Stella, are you crazy?

51:09.416 --> 51:12.375
It is a dismal place.

51:12.541 --> 51:14.416
There is fighting with
a knife every night!

51:14.666 --> 51:17.208
If Orpheus could charm the fauves,

51:17.375 --> 51:20.916
we can make the mass sing
to this mute parrot!

51:21.083 --> 51:22.208
Let's run it!

51:23.666 --> 51:24.875
Attends.

51:25.041 --> 51:27.875
You have the chest in the
air, close your coat.

51:28.375 --> 51:29.875
Do not be afraid.

51:30.041 --> 51:31.500
I know how to defend myself!

51:53.208 --> 51:54.541
"A liter and a half, sir!

51:54.791 --> 51:56.125
Mademoiselle!

52:04.541 --> 52:05.333
Health.

52:36.208 --> 52:37.458
How much for a pipe?

52:38.875 --> 52:40.833
But, I'm not practicing
prostitution.

52:41.208 --> 52:42.458
Damage,

52:43.458 --> 52:45.750
you have the skin so white.

52:47.541 --> 52:49.416
I am an artist, I am a poet.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.166
Poet...

52:56.708 --> 52:58.750
Like that big bust of Neruda?

53:00.291 --> 53:02.291
Recite me something.

53:03.333 --> 53:06.041
Agree.
I will improvise some verses.

53:06.208 --> 53:08.250
After, leave me alone.

53:13.291 --> 53:17.666
"There where there are
ears but no songs,

53:18.833 --> 53:21.458
" in this world that dissolves,

53:21.833 --> 53:24.333
"where Being offers itself to the destitute,"  "I am much more my footsteps than my footsteps"  No!  I am a poet! = = Halte, macaques!  Respect to the vengeful vagina  = = = = =

55:19.333 --> 55:20.375
Ricardo!

55:21.000 --> 55:22.833
What? Did you know him?

55:23.583 --> 55:24.916
That was my cousin.

55:29.625 --> 55:33.958
But what idea to commit suicide
before the University of Chile!

55:36.000 --> 55:38.708
He did not want to become an architect.

55:40.541 --> 55:42.000
"Like a bird,

55:43.750 --> 55:46.166
" like the viscera of a tree,

55:46.333 --> 55:51.041
"You have come to the end of your quest, conquered and condemned," "for muzzling the
soul you hid." You can not do anything for him anymore. Stella, I do not know who I am.

56:15.750 --> 56:19.500
I do not want to live in the
chaos you create. It's clear ?

56:21.583 --> 56:23.083
I beg you...

56:24.458 --> 56:26.375
Let me find myself.

56:27.541 --> 56:29.583
Give me a few days of solitude.

56:33.666 --> 56:36.208
We will meet again at Café Iris,

56:37.375 --> 56:40.083
at midnight pile,

56:40.250 --> 56:42.541
In forty days.

56:57.833 --> 56:59.375
Mange, Alejandro.

57:00.041 --> 57:02.750
It's been forty days that
you're locked up here,

57:02.916 --> 57:06.458
to sculpt puppets without
putting the nose out.

57:06.708 --> 57:07.583
Why?

57:07.916 --> 57:09.625
I feel empty.

57:10.750 --> 57:13.958
I sculpt faces
because I lost mine.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.333
I did not find myself.

57:19.791 --> 57:20.833
Maybe tonight,

57:21.041 --> 57:23.833
I will again be the mirror
of this terrible woman.

57:49.458 --> 57:51.416
What did you do to your hair?

57:52.125 --> 57:54.416
The god I was waiting for

57:54.583 --> 57:56.958
descended from the mountains.

57:58.041 --> 58:00.000
I'm no longer a virgin.

58:02.083 --> 58:06.958
I carry the perfect child
that destiny had promised me.

58:07.791 --> 58:10.083
I am a dove announcing.

58:11.333 --> 58:12.708
Leave me alone.

58:55.750 --> 58:57.208
Do not worry.

58:58.333 --> 59:01.125
This is a harmless
attack of sadness.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
<i>The first look I've posed on you</i>

59:22.791 --> 59:25.666
<i>Stayed engraved in my eyes</i>

59:26.416 --> 59:31.958
<i>And now Where will my song go?</i>

59:56.916 --> 59:58.500
But she looks like me!

59:58.916 --> 01:00:00.083
Let's see.

01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:04.083
That's right!

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:06.583
I buy you.

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:07.958
No, I offer it to you.

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:09.583
No, I buy you.

01:00:16.166 --> 01:00:18.250
And this one looks like a friend!

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:20.708
Miracles exist.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:24.333
I have to present it to
you, it is a great artist.

01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:28.125
I offer them to you.

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:30.750
Andrew, for you.

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:33.625
Luz, for you.

01:02:33.791 --> 01:02:35.583
So you will stay together.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:40.125
You are a divine messenger, my boy.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:45.416
Thanks to you, Luz and I
will not be separated.

01:02:46.541 --> 01:02:47.625
This workshop

01:02:47.833 --> 01:02:48.708
is mine.

01:02:48.875 --> 01:02:50.250
I give it to you.

01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:56.791
That's right?

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:00.875
But it's a miracle!

01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:02.833
Thank you!

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:05.083
Thank you!

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.000
Thanks...

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:15.791
Here I will be able to create,

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.666
write,

01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:19.833
do whatever I want.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.208
Here it is at home.

01:03:21.375 --> 01:03:23.416
I'll even organize parties

01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:28.583
with boxers,
politicians, whores,

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.875
all my friends.

01:03:30.041 --> 01:03:32.500
It's going to be party, here!

01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:40.625
This place will be a paradise.

01:03:40.791 --> 01:03:42.708
A paradise!

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:13.625
If everyday life
seems to us a hell,

01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:16.000
if it is reduced to these two words:

01:04:16.166 --> 01:04:18.250
"permanent impermanence",

01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:20.625
one must follow the precept of the Bible.

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:23.250
"Nothing better for the man

01:04:23.416 --> 01:04:24.916
" than to eat,

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:25.958
"let him drink,

01:04:26.125 --> 01:04:28.041
" and his soul rejoice! " He that has legs, dance!  He that has hands, caress!  And that he who Has a language that confesses her sins on the Chair of the Truth! = = I have been waiting for her all my life.  I finally found her

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.541
I would like to caress her infinitely,

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:40.041
But...

01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:44.291
I lost them when I was a child.

01:05:21.541 --> 01:05:23.958
that I forgot that
I was penguin.

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:28.791
Until the day she
offered me her body.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.375
And me,

01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:33.291
can only caress it half,

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.833
I would like to have
two, four, eight,

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:38.750
thousand hands...

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.208
and can caress her all my life.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.250
Who wants to help me, with his hands,

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.208
to realize my dream?

01:05:49.791 --> 01:05:51.333
Go up here, please.

01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:43.375
"If life is madness..."

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:46.750
Who is this poet behind his mirror?

01:06:46.916 --> 01:06:48.125
This is Enrique Lihn.

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:53.291
"... such is my poetry:
clairvoyant obscurity

01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:57.291
" I am only my own absence

01:06:57.458 --> 01:06:59.750
"behind a broken mirror."

01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:20.083
Who is there?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
The organizer of holidays!

01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:27.541
I'm coming.

01:07:32.083 --> 01:07:33.333
What do you want?

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.958
I want to be your friend.

01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:38.500
Are you homosexual?

01:07:39.166 --> 01:07:40.041
No.

01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:44.875
Why do you want to be my friend then?

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:46.791
Because I admire your poetry.

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:52.416
I see. It's my verse that
interests you, not me.

01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:54.250
Well, yes!

01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:57.291
Come on in!

01:07:57.458 --> 01:07:58.250
Between!

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:10.416
<i>The U.S.A rely on their
powerful B-29 bombers</i>

01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:15.125
<i>to which the Russians can
oppose their aggressive MIG...</i>

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:17.957
What do you think, Tito?

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:21.166
Although cold, it is still war.

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.250
Raise the sound.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.666
<i>The U.S.A rely on their
powerful bombers B-29</i>

01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:32.457
<i>to which the Russians can
oppose their aggressive MIG...</i>

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:36.500
These are my parents.

01:08:36.666 --> 01:08:39.500
This stupid war has
sucked the brain.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.582
It's been a long time since they died.

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:43.666
Come on.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.666
Welcome to my temple.

01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:52.082
Can I?

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:53.041
Please.

01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:08.166
I love it!

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:22.041
It's you who wrote all that?

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.082
Yes, everything.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:32.207
"Because you are invisible, you
despise you, perfect diamond."

01:09:32.457 --> 01:09:37.332
"The death I am running, runs
without hurrying at my side."

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.457
But there are poems
on the ground!

01:09:45.082 --> 01:09:47.082
This wonderful work will be lost!

01:09:47.332 --> 01:09:48.332
Everything will get lost.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.082
Our souls are going to be lost.

01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:55.208
It does not matter.
Dreams also get lost,

01:09:55.375 --> 01:10:00.208
and ourselves, little
by little, we dissolve.

01:10:00.375 --> 01:10:03.041
Poetry, such as the shadow
of an eagle in flight,

01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:05.541
leaves no trace on earth.

01:10:05.708 --> 01:10:08.916
A poem reaches perfection
only when it is consumed.

01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:13.125
I could not bear to see
such a work consumed.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.875
Let's do something.

01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:16.416
Let's go for a walk.

01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:19.208
Let's go!

01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:23.250
On the attack!

01:10:26.458 --> 01:10:29.083
Alejandro, do you agree with me?

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:32.958
The language we were taught
carries crazy ideas.

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:34.750
That's it, my dear Enrique.

01:10:34.916 --> 01:10:38.208
Instead of thinking
straight, we think twisted.

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:42.416
I would like to point out that we
also walk in a twisted manner.

01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:45.500
I feel like we're
going straight.

01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:49.791
Yes, but this truck
will force us to fork.

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:55.583
What to do?

01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:58.958
We poets, we are
obliged to nothing.

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:01.666
Continue in a straight line.

01:11:21.166 --> 01:11:22.166
Fools!

01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:23.500
My truck!

01:11:23.666 --> 01:11:25.833
Fuck you, shit!

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.125
Give me the camp, assholes!

01:11:53.833 --> 01:11:55.500
You want, young men?

01:11:55.666 --> 01:11:58.791
Respectable lady, we
are poets in action.

01:11:58.958 --> 01:12:01.500
We cross the city
in a straight line.

01:12:01.666 --> 01:12:04.125
Can we cross your house?

01:12:05.208 --> 01:12:06.708
Why do you do this?

01:12:07.583 --> 01:12:10.416
To develop our
conscience, madame.

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:13.000
Ah, good. Then...

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:15.166
Go ahead, enter.

01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:29.416
Dear madam,

01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:31.458
in order to continue straight,

01:12:31.791 --> 01:12:34.083
do you allow us to
walk on this obstacle?

01:12:35.958 --> 01:12:38.083
That's why we sleep here...

01:12:40.916 --> 01:12:42.458
Wait to see...

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:45.666
Help me.

01:12:50.125 --> 01:12:51.333
That's good.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.333
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, sublime lady.

01:13:00.875 --> 01:13:03.208
You have just entered history.

01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:05.708
Farewell, unforgettable lady.

01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:37.916
What is marked there?

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:41.666
"Forbidden to pedestrians."

01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:43.375
Prohibited to prohibit!

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:44.458
Well said!

01:14:12.208 --> 01:14:13.000
Alejandro,

01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:15.333
poetry is an act!

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.958
Yes, a thousand times yes!

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.958
Poetry is an act!

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:26.458
I have the pride and honor
to welcome on this platform

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:30.291
that traveled great personalities

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.541
such as Pablo Neruda, Vicente
Huidobro and so many others

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:39.500
who rest in the Olympus of glory.

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:40.958
With you,

01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:45.375
Alejandro Jodorowsky and Enrique Lihn.

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:01.041
"Wretched Prometheus."  "Hearts of Sugar.

01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:03.000
"Scents perfumed.

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.166
" Soft feathers.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.916
"Fall from your souls anemic and without balls... "... in the intense flesh.

01:15:06.083 --> 01:15:08.583
"In our mother the flesh" = = "In the fucking flesh!"
It's a scandal! = = That's enough! Outside! Bastards!

01:15:30.208 --> 01:15:31.750
We're going to drive you
flesh in the ass, shit!

01:15:31.958 --> 01:15:32.916
Catch them!

01:15:34.416 --> 01:15:35.250
Out of here!

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:37.375
Son of whores!

01:15:47.916 --> 01:15:50.083
"Oyez, citizens!

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:53.166
In our struggle to
change this real city

01:15:53.333 --> 01:15:54.791
into an imaginary city,

01:15:54.958 --> 01:15:59.083
we invited you to the foot of
the statue of Pablo Neruda...

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:02.875
This viscous national poet.

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:23.166
Inaugurated the statue
of the invisible man,

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:27.125
in homage to all the anonymous people
who inhabit this city without dream.

01:16:29.416 --> 01:16:32.083
Nobody ever said anything!

01:16:32.333 --> 01:16:34.916
We have been silent forever!

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:38.083
Nobody ever listened to anything!

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:49.333
Who are you?

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.708
I'm your fiancée,

01:16:50.916 --> 01:16:52.833
the woman of all your lives.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.166
Rather be the wife
of all my dead.

01:16:57.916 --> 01:16:58.791
To drink!

01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:15.291
Enter, friends.

01:17:18.208 --> 01:17:19.125
Hello!

01:17:21.875 --> 01:17:23.250
The soup...

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:28.750
that end without interruption...

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:34.625
like life, nourishes and
burns at the same time.

01:17:34.875 --> 01:17:36.833
We have a gift for you.

01:17:38.833 --> 01:17:39.916
A poet.

01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:42.125
Poet!

01:17:44.041 --> 01:17:45.416
I love the poets!

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:48.375
What is your name?

01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:49.500
Alejandro.

01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:54.916
I see a diamond
hidden in your heart.

01:17:55.791 --> 01:17:57.083
Come,

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:59.458
I will read the Tarot.

01:18:58.916 --> 01:19:00.125
The Devil.

01:19:01.583 --> 01:19:03.666
Innocence you will lose.

01:19:03.833 --> 01:19:06.041
Your dark side you will find.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:10.416
And you shall create, and create.

01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:29.541
The Star.

01:20:30.916 --> 01:20:33.750
From woman to woman you will go.

01:20:34.791 --> 01:20:37.291
Your ideal wife you will find.

01:21:30.041 --> 01:21:32.500
I am the one you will be.

01:21:33.458 --> 01:21:35.333
Or you were the one I am.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
You gave yourself to poetry,
and I do not regret it.

01:21:40.166 --> 01:21:41.500
What shall I get?

01:21:41.666 --> 01:21:44.875
You will learn to die happy.

01:21:45.583 --> 01:21:46.833
I'm afraid of dying.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.916
You are afraid to live.

01:21:49.083 --> 01:21:51.291
I'm afraid of disappointing others.

01:21:52.083 --> 01:21:55.083
You are not guilty of
living as you are.

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:59.750
You would be guilty of living
like others want you to live.

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:01.666
What is the meaning of life?

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:03.500
Life!

01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:05.916
The brain asks questions,

01:22:06.083 --> 01:22:08.541
the heart gives the answers.

01:22:08.708 --> 01:22:12.291
Life has no meaning,
we must live it!

01:22:12.458 --> 01:22:13.666
Screw!

01:22:13.833 --> 01:22:15.041
Screw!

01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:16.500
Screw!

01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:25.375
Open the door!

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:00.750
Leave me to die, Alejandro.

01:23:00.916 --> 01:23:03.166
My Lord Enrique has forsaken me.

01:23:04.625 --> 01:23:05.875
If you really wanted to die,

01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:09.500
You would not have told Verónica
that you wanted to commit suicide.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.791
It was she who warned me.

01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:13.791
And why not my Lord?

01:23:14.041 --> 01:23:17.500
Because Enrique is completely drunk.
Can not talk to him.

01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:20.916
When he has desolated,
he will return to you.

01:23:21.458 --> 01:23:22.708
He loves you.

01:23:22.875 --> 01:23:24.875
He will not come back.

01:23:25.041 --> 01:23:28.416
He decided to find a
woman bigger than me.

01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:30.583
That's why he left me.

01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:34.291
You, it is you,
whatever your size.

01:23:35.166 --> 01:23:36.708
And what am I?

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:37.666
Nothing.

01:23:37.833 --> 01:23:39.625
He, my Lord, is all.

01:23:41.041 --> 01:23:41.875
Come on.

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:44.208
Come here.

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:50.125
Go to...

01:23:52.916 --> 01:23:54.458
Pequeñita, I am your friend.

01:23:55.083 --> 01:23:57.625
I saved your life.
Do you trust me ?

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.208
Yes.

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:04.750
So promise me to do
whatever I tell you.

01:24:04.916 --> 01:24:07.083
Ok, I promise.

01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:11.708
I want you to close your eyes

01:24:12.625 --> 01:24:15.791
and that as a blind,
you let me guide you.

01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:18.083
Close your eyes.

01:24:19.208 --> 01:24:20.708
Go, close your eyes.

01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:28.958
You promised me to open my
eyes only when I tell you.

01:24:29.166 --> 01:24:30.208
Yes, it's promised.

01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:31.500
Good.

01:24:36.666 --> 01:24:37.666
Lifts your foot.

01:24:38.791 --> 01:24:39.583
That's it.

01:24:49.833 --> 01:24:51.583
Now I will raise you.

01:24:59.458 --> 01:25:00.541
Open your eyes.

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:02.958
Do not let me go, Alejandro!

01:25:03.125 --> 01:25:04.083
You're crazy!

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:05.625
Alejandro, ask me!

01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:07.416
Removed me from there!

01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:09.958
I can fall, do not let go!

01:25:13.833 --> 01:25:15.166
You're crazy!

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:17.333
You could have killed me.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.750
You see that you did not want to die?

01:25:22.166 --> 01:25:25.083
Dead, you would not have
the pleasure to breathe.

01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:26.625
Breathe with me.

01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:34.541
I had forgotten that the air existed.

01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:49.875
- Are you feeling good?
- Better than ever.

01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:51.333
Come in my arms.

01:25:51.708 --> 01:25:52.583
That's it.

01:25:54.958 --> 01:25:56.166
Life is beautiful.

01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:57.125
That's right.

01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:58.291
Again.

01:26:03.125 --> 01:26:05.333
You were very good with me.

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.375
I want to give you a present:

01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:08.458
my sex.

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.791
But I have my rules.

01:26:12.541 --> 01:26:13.458
Do you mind?

01:26:15.583 --> 01:26:17.291
Blood is sacred.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:44.833
I fell from the tower!

01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:46.750
Open it!

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.416
Do not open.

01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:50.625
Let us drink the cup to the dregs.

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:52.208
Continue.

01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:54.625
Open it!

01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:14.375
We have to open it.

01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:49.583
You!

01:28:52.708 --> 01:28:55.166
When I was living here,
when I was here...

01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:00.291
I was at the top!

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.041
At the top, I felt right here!

01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:08.916
I fell like a worm!

01:29:09.083 --> 01:29:11.416
And like a worm, you treat me.

01:29:30.416 --> 01:29:31.875
I wrote you a poem.

01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:39.250
"Because you alone feel that you live

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:42.500
" when, insolent, you betray me,

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:47.458
"I tie you with the rope of your limits!" "I
extract you from the future like a dead muse,

01:29:48.333 --> 01:29:51.958
"I lock you in my
mother's coffin

01:29:52.125 --> 01:29:55.083
" Rotten among her
wretched bones

01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:58.750
"to which I still implore a caress!"

01:29:58.916 --> 01:30:02.083
The bridge has broken.

01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:12.583
Why do you do that, young girl?

01:30:29.291 --> 01:30:31.708
I try to forget.

01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:35.208
As long as Enrique lives in my memory,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.458
I will only be a corpse.

01:30:39.041 --> 01:30:40.625
Go ahead, Doctor.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.041
Relax.

01:31:01.041 --> 01:31:02.416
Enrique...

01:31:19.333 --> 01:31:20.416
There are seven other pints, my pretty.

01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:51.625
I have...

01:31:59.916 --> 01:32:00.833
I did not find any flowers.

01:32:09.166 --> 01:32:10.000
Thank you.

01:32:16.083 --> 01:32:17.208
Do not worry,

01:32:17.708 --> 01:32:18.958
it does not matter.

01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:23.375
Here.

01:32:30.041 --> 01:32:35.208
Even if this is the only
thing I can get from you,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.916
well, I'll keep it...

01:32:39.333 --> 01:32:41.458
forever with me.

01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:47.333
Come on, you've suffered enough like that.

01:32:47.875 --> 01:32:49.916
Leave me alone.
- No way.

01:32:50.083 --> 01:32:51.000
Leave me alone.

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:53.166
Listen to me. You are small...

01:32:53.333 --> 01:32:54.375
Go away.

01:32:54.541 --> 01:32:56.041
I am small.

01:32:56.458 --> 01:32:58.125
Together we can grow.

01:32:59.958 --> 01:33:02.458
I will not leave you here.
Let's go.

01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:04.708
Come on, come on.

01:33:04.875 --> 01:33:05.916
Come with me.

01:33:06.583 --> 01:33:07.666
That's it. Good.

01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:13.833
Leave me alone.
- No, I'm not going to leave you here.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.541
You will go with me.

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:17.333
Go.

01:33:31.208 --> 01:33:33.000
I'm not guilty.

01:33:34.291 --> 01:33:36.000
I'm not guilty.

01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:38.958
I'm not guilty.

01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:42.291
I'm not guilty.

01:33:43.291 --> 01:33:44.958
I'm not guilty.

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:47.708
I'm not guilty.

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:51.458
I'm not guilty.

01:33:52.333 --> 01:33:54.291
I'm not guilty.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.583
I'm not guilty.

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.833
I'm not guilty!

01:34:09.666 --> 01:34:11.916
Can I ask you a question?

01:34:13.083 --> 01:34:13.875
Yes.

01:34:14.833 --> 01:34:17.791
Tell me, where did you
find these shoes?

01:34:18.791 --> 01:34:20.958
I got them done.

01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:23.875
Why then?

01:34:24.666 --> 01:34:27.750
Because I love the circus.
Especially the clowns.

01:34:27.916 --> 01:34:31.041
I'm glad to hear it.

01:34:31.208 --> 01:34:33.416
Let me introduce myself:

01:34:33.875 --> 01:34:38.333
I'm Carrot, the orange clown.

01:34:39.208 --> 01:34:41.875
I saw you playing Tocopilla
when I was a kid!

01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:43.625
My name is Alejandro Jodorowsky.

01:34:45.083 --> 01:34:47.291
I understand now.

01:34:47.458 --> 01:34:49.208
You are one of us.

01:34:50.583 --> 01:34:54.416
Your father and I worked
in the same circus.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:58.375
A cat will always look for rats.

01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:00.708
These shoes express

01:35:01.125 --> 01:35:04.208
that you want to return to the
world to which you belong.

01:35:04.416 --> 01:35:06.833
I do not think I can.

01:35:08.208 --> 01:35:11.375
If you have kept your soul as a child,

01:35:11.541 --> 01:35:13.375
you will do it very well.

01:35:13.583 --> 01:35:16.791
Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:35:17.791 --> 01:35:21.083
I have the honor to present you

01:35:21.833 --> 01:35:23.625
the fabulous circus

01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:28.166
The Human Eagles!

01:35:28.416 --> 01:35:32.583
The most refined and elegant
circus in the country!

01:35:33.208 --> 01:35:34.291
Yes or No?

01:35:36.958 --> 01:35:39.291
That's...

01:35:40.916 --> 01:35:42.125
Can I enter?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.958
Comment this?
You have already entered.

01:35:52.041 --> 01:35:52.958
Who are you?

01:35:53.208 --> 01:35:54.583
I'm a stranger!

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:55.583
From which country?

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:57.291
Of Strange!

01:35:59.708 --> 01:36:00.875
And what do you want?

01:36:01.125 --> 01:36:03.458
Work, Mr. Director.

01:36:04.875 --> 01:36:06.333
What do you do?

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.791
I know fart.

01:36:11.291 --> 01:36:12.166
Let's see.

01:36:17.541 --> 01:36:22.125
Know, sir, that here only
Chileans have the right to fart!

01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:25.208
So return fart to your homeland!

01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:31.166
Disgusting foreigner!

01:36:31.791 --> 01:36:34.958
It deserves a good correction!
Come on guys !

01:37:16.291 --> 01:37:18.291
I can not stand it anymore!

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:21.666
I'm nobody!
No one !

01:37:21.916 --> 01:37:24.958
I feel so bad, I want
to commit suicide!

01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:30.666
But how?

01:37:31.625 --> 01:37:32.833
I found it!

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.916
I'll tickle myself until
I die of laughter.

01:37:45.041 --> 01:37:47.000
My best friend hates me!

01:37:49.583 --> 01:37:50.875
I am a traitor,

01:37:51.125 --> 01:37:53.208
I slept with his fiancée!

01:37:55.208 --> 01:37:57.666
She may have given me syphilis!

01:37:59.583 --> 01:38:02.458
The poor girl may
have gotten pregnant!

01:38:03.708 --> 01:38:05.291
Life is a game!

01:38:05.458 --> 01:38:08.958
We must laugh at everything, even the worst!

01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:10.458
Laugh!

01:38:11.208 --> 01:38:12.166
Laugh!

01:38:12.416 --> 01:38:14.375
Yes, laugh!

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.916
Suffering is silly!

01:38:30.291 --> 01:38:31.833
I'm not a clown.

01:38:32.666 --> 01:38:34.000
I'm a poet!

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:36.541
Poet! Poet...

01:39:12.041 --> 01:39:14.416
<i>"I never found you, " I always lost you.</i>

01:39:14.583 --> 01:39:16.666
<i>"An eternity to travel in search of the impossible encounter... " to tell you that it is you,</i>

01:39:28.416 --> 01:39:30.791
"built my dreams."

01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:39.833
Awake, poet.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.250
Poet.

01:39:43.666 --> 01:39:46.500
It would be better to sleep than to be awake.

01:39:47.625 --> 01:39:49.666
It would be better to be dead.

01:39:52.083 --> 01:39:54.000
Better not be born.

01:39:55.666 --> 01:39:57.000
That's enough, Enrique.

01:39:57.666 --> 01:39:59.083
You are destroying you.

01:40:00.125 --> 01:40:02.500
We will not let you commit suicide.

01:40:10.958 --> 01:40:13.041
Everything is nothing but nothing.

01:40:13.208 --> 01:40:15.000
You're wasting your time.

01:40:15.166 --> 01:40:16.916
Everything is life!

01:40:17.708 --> 01:40:18.791
Life.

01:40:20.166 --> 01:40:22.208
It's not you who suffer,

01:40:23.208 --> 01:40:25.958
This is the picture
you made of yourself.

01:40:26.708 --> 01:40:27.958
You are a poet!

01:40:29.125 --> 01:40:31.125
Look at things differently.

01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:35.708
Neither I nor Pequeñita
took anything from you.

01:40:35.875 --> 01:40:37.250
I'm your friend...

01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:41.166
and will remain so until my death.

01:40:42.208 --> 01:40:44.208
For Pequeñita, you are God.

01:40:45.791 --> 01:40:48.125
Yes, you are God!

01:40:49.125 --> 01:40:50.541
And here is your child.

01:40:50.708 --> 01:40:53.375
Lying dog, this
fetus is not mine!

01:40:53.583 --> 01:40:54.791
I have begotten him thinking of you!

01:40:57.125 --> 01:40:58.916
I speak to your heart.

01:40:59.666 --> 01:41:01.708
Have mercy on me.

01:41:01.875 --> 01:41:04.333
I have your name tattooed in my soul.

01:41:04.583 --> 01:41:06.458
If you do not love me, I will kill myself.

01:41:08.125 --> 01:41:11.500
If you do not love me, I
will make you love me.

01:41:12.291 --> 01:41:15.583
If you do not love me, I'll
wait for you to love me.

01:41:30.875 --> 01:41:32.291
I deserve more.

01:41:59.583 --> 01:42:01.333
This is our son at all!

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:04.625
Baptism!

01:42:17.833 --> 01:42:18.625
Daddy?

01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:20.833
Mother, what are you doing here?

01:42:21.708 --> 01:42:24.333
The house burned.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.541
- The house of Matucana?
- Yes !

01:42:26.791 --> 01:42:28.000
The house of Matucana, your house.

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:29.875
Furniture, clothes, beds!

01:42:30.083 --> 01:42:32.208
My writings too? My books ?

01:42:32.416 --> 01:42:33.541
Your writings and books?

01:42:33.708 --> 01:42:36.416
I burn my ass with your
writings and your books!

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:39.958
How can you ask me
such a bullshit?

01:42:41.208 --> 01:42:43.166
The money burned!

01:42:43.333 --> 01:42:46.291
My money hidden in the wardrobe!

01:42:46.541 --> 01:42:48.916
And the porcelain tableware
that your mother kept...

01:42:49.166 --> 01:42:52.875
- Since our wedding.
- <i> Since our wedding!</i>

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.458
But what have you become?

01:42:56.833 --> 01:42:58.583
Do you have no heart left?

01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:00.958
Does not you care?

01:43:01.916 --> 01:43:03.875
I do not know who you are!

01:43:06.125 --> 01:43:08.916
You hang out here, in
this drunken haunt!

01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:11.958
Of degenerate!

01:43:15.833 --> 01:43:16.916
You disgust me!

01:43:17.083 --> 01:43:18.833
You disgust us!

01:43:20.083 --> 01:43:22.000
We'll get a hotel!

01:43:34.291 --> 01:43:35.875
My house burned.

01:43:40.541 --> 01:43:41.916
What a wonder!

01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:57.625
Farewell, childhood.

01:45:38.125 --> 01:45:42.625
My poor mother, all her
life hidden in this corset.

01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:47.375
A humble swan among vain ducks.

01:45:50.916 --> 01:45:52.958
Love? Balloons ?

01:45:53.125 --> 01:45:54.208
Love?

01:45:54.375 --> 01:45:55.916
I take them all.

01:45:56.083 --> 01:45:57.083
Good, sir.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.291
That's enough, Alejandro.

01:46:28.875 --> 01:46:31.541
The eagle that has grown
no longer needs a nest.

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:35.083
Fly if you have wings!

01:46:35.250 --> 01:46:36.541
It's over, Matucana!

01:46:37.041 --> 01:46:39.666
It's over, winter.
The spring is coming !

01:46:39.833 --> 01:46:41.791
The carnival begins!

01:46:41.958 --> 01:46:44.083
So fly! Stolen !

01:46:44.250 --> 01:46:45.958
Come on!

01:46:46.125 --> 01:46:47.375
Fly!

01:48:22.833 --> 01:48:23.833
And you!

01:48:24.708 --> 01:48:25.833
Who are you?

01:48:27.958 --> 01:48:30.541
What is the purpose
of your existence?

01:48:31.791 --> 01:48:33.125
Why are you alive?

01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:36.625
I have never been alive,

01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:39.041
I was born dead.

01:48:40.625 --> 01:48:43.000
One dead more among the dead.

01:48:54.208 --> 01:48:56.916
One more death among the dead...

01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:59.791
I will age,

01:49:00.875 --> 01:49:01.916
dying,

01:49:02.708 --> 01:49:04.041
rot...

01:49:05.208 --> 01:49:07.750
Nothing will swallow my memory...

01:49:08.958 --> 01:49:10.041
my words,

01:49:11.125 --> 01:49:12.583
my conscience,

01:49:13.666 --> 01:49:17.375
everything that is mine, engulfed
by the black well of forgetfulness.

01:49:20.875 --> 01:49:23.500
These streets will also disappear,

01:49:24.125 --> 01:49:25.250
my friends...

01:49:28.041 --> 01:49:29.083
the city,

01:49:29.791 --> 01:49:30.833
the planet!

01:49:34.458 --> 01:49:36.041
The moon, the sun,

01:49:37.125 --> 01:49:38.375
the stars!

01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:40.708
The entire universe!

01:49:42.583 --> 01:49:44.250
Cursed reflection!

01:49:45.375 --> 01:49:48.791
I do what now about the
anguish that you injected me?

01:50:04.791 --> 01:50:05.916
Old age

01:50:06.666 --> 01:50:08.583
is not a humiliation.

01:50:10.666 --> 01:50:12.250
You detach yourself from everything.

01:50:13.375 --> 01:50:14.500
Sex,

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.291
of fortune,

01:50:18.875 --> 01:50:20.166
of celebrity.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.958
You are detached from yourself.

01:50:25.916 --> 01:50:27.500
Become

01:50:27.666 --> 01:50:29.208
A butterfly

01:50:30.208 --> 01:50:32.041
resplendent!

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000
One being...

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.166
of pure light!

01:50:56.458 --> 01:50:57.583
Mr. Parra.

01:50:58.583 --> 01:50:59.875
- Alejandro.
- Hello.

01:51:00.041 --> 01:51:02.041
- How are you?
- Very good.

01:51:03.041 --> 01:51:04.666
As you can see,

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:07.791
your favorite poet
teaches mathematics

01:51:07.958 --> 01:51:10.750
in this school of engineers.

01:51:11.458 --> 01:51:13.041
What brings you?

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.583
Well, here it is:

01:51:15.125 --> 01:51:18.000
as I have no relationship
with my father,

01:51:18.208 --> 01:51:21.000
I need your advice, Don Nicanor.

01:51:21.166 --> 01:51:22.666
That is to say?

01:51:23.375 --> 01:51:26.250
I want to dedicate myself
body and soul to poetry.

01:51:26.416 --> 01:51:27.666
Are you crazy?

01:51:28.291 --> 01:51:31.916
No one ever buys books,
let alone poetry.

01:51:32.166 --> 01:51:35.416
What you need to do is study,

01:51:35.583 --> 01:51:36.875
get a diploma,

01:51:37.041 --> 01:51:39.500
and a teacher position, like me.

01:51:39.666 --> 01:51:42.208
Do not compromise your
future, Alejandro!

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.125
Butterflies must not
turn into flies,

01:51:47.291 --> 01:51:49.166
nor poets in professors.

01:51:50.583 --> 01:51:51.875
I am a teacher,

01:51:52.166 --> 01:51:54.458
and I do not turn into a fly.

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:57.958
The world is what it is.
You will not change it.

01:51:58.125 --> 01:52:01.875
If I do not change the world,
I can start changing it!

01:52:02.041 --> 01:52:02.958
Oh yes?

01:52:03.125 --> 01:52:04.000
And how?

01:52:04.166 --> 01:52:05.875
Changing myself.

01:52:06.041 --> 01:52:08.083
I will not back off, Don Nicanor.

01:52:08.416 --> 01:52:09.291
Farewell.

01:52:27.333 --> 01:52:29.583
Ibáñez! Ibáñez!

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:37.708
My horse!

01:52:38.166 --> 01:52:39.833
Where is my horse?

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.166
I come back!

01:52:54.166 --> 01:52:58.291
I come back to sweep away corruption!

01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:07.166
Ibáñez at the Palace will
give the blow of broom!

01:53:14.416 --> 01:53:18.625
<i>You will see that all is lie</i>

01:53:18.875 --> 01:53:22.333
<i>You will see that nothing is love</i>

01:53:23.291 --> 01:53:26.958
<i>And the world does not care about it</i>

01:53:27.208 --> 01:53:30.708
<i>It turns, it turns</i>

01:53:32.250 --> 01:53:35.416
<i>- Even if life crushes you</i>
- Alejandro!

01:53:35.583 --> 01:53:40.875
Alejandro! Share with us
the sad joie de vivre.

01:53:41.041 --> 01:53:43.125
We are in paradise!

01:53:43.291 --> 01:53:45.000
What paradise?

01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:47.750
This country is an island!

01:53:48.583 --> 01:53:50.708
I say good-bye to you, I am going to Paris.

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:52.708
To do what?

01:53:52.958 --> 01:53:56.250
All cities resemble each other:
only people and streets.

01:53:56.458 --> 01:53:59.666
I will integrate André Breton's
group and I will save Surrealism.

01:54:01.791 --> 01:54:03.750
No one knows you there.

01:54:03.916 --> 01:54:06.541
Here you have your friends...

01:54:06.791 --> 01:54:08.125
You are very little.

01:54:08.291 --> 01:54:10.458
The others chose Ibáñez.

01:54:11.375 --> 01:54:12.166
Farewell.

01:54:13.791 --> 01:54:15.250
Remains, Alejandro.

01:54:18.916 --> 01:54:19.833
Leave me alone!

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.916
My father was right.

01:54:22.083 --> 01:54:23.041
To death Ibáñez!

01:54:23.833 --> 01:54:25.041
To death Ibáñez!

01:54:25.583 --> 01:54:26.791
He's going to get killed!

01:54:27.291 --> 01:54:29.666
Alejandro, shut up!

01:54:29.916 --> 01:54:32.625
Ibáñez at the Palace will
give the blow of broom!

01:54:33.041 --> 01:54:34.333
To death Ibáñez!

01:54:52.458 --> 01:54:54.291
To death Ibáñez! Idiots!

01:54:54.458 --> 01:54:55.416
To death Ibáñez!

01:54:56.166 --> 01:54:57.083
Idiots!

01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:58.833
Shut up, Alejandro.

01:54:59.041 --> 01:55:02.250
You waste your time, they
only see him and his horse.

01:55:02.416 --> 01:55:04.041
- Leave me alone!
- Shut up.

01:55:04.208 --> 01:55:05.875
Leave me alone! Idiots!

01:55:06.083 --> 01:55:07.875
Shit fascists!

01:55:08.041 --> 01:55:10.875
To death Ibáñez! Idiots!

01:55:27.458 --> 01:55:28.583
I'm leaving.

01:55:59.416 --> 01:56:02.208
<i>I'm going</i>

01:56:03.916 --> 01:56:09.083
<i>To the port where I am waiting</i>

01:56:11.083 --> 01:56:14.958
<i>The golden barque</i>

01:56:16.875 --> 01:56:21.250
<i>Who will take me</i>

01:56:21.458 --> 01:56:24.500
<i>I'm going</i>

01:56:26.583 --> 01:56:31.916
<i>This is my last farewell</i>

01:56:34.375 --> 01:56:38.041
<i>Goodbye, poets</i>

01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:43.625
<i>Farewell, forever, farewell</i>

01:57:18.208 --> 01:57:19.500
Alejandro!

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.291
But finally...

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:23.333
Are you leaving without saying goodbye to your father?

01:57:24.041 --> 01:57:26.375
What are you doing there?
How did you find me?

01:57:26.625 --> 01:57:29.583
Your friend Verónica told me
that you were leaving Chile,

01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:33.125
That you were penniless, and
that I should help you...

01:57:33.291 --> 01:57:36.958
It is out of question that I
fund such a stupid thing!

01:57:37.125 --> 01:57:39.458
You do not speak a word of French!

01:57:39.625 --> 01:57:42.458
Are you going to live from what?
Of your little poems?

01:57:44.875 --> 01:57:47.083
That's enough now!

01:57:48.041 --> 01:57:50.958
Come in with me, I need
help at the store.

01:57:51.208 --> 01:57:52.875
You need a slave!

01:57:53.083 --> 01:57:56.458
You have nothing of a father,
you never took me in your arms,

01:57:56.625 --> 01:57:58.000
nor talked gently!

01:57:58.166 --> 01:58:00.041
Men do not touch each other.

01:58:00.208 --> 01:58:02.541
They do not have to talk softly.

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.833
When I vomited bitter tears,

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.291
beggar a little tenderness,
a little attention,

01:58:08.458 --> 01:58:10.500
You let me cry for hours.

01:58:10.666 --> 01:58:13.416
I do not console anyone.
You became too fagot.

01:58:15.041 --> 01:58:16.458
I'm not a fagot!

01:58:16.666 --> 01:58:19.333
I have a poet's heart, me.
Not like you !

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:22.125
A heart capable of
loving the whole world!

01:58:24.916 --> 01:58:26.291
That's my boat.

01:58:31.125 --> 01:58:32.458
Listen to me!

01:58:32.625 --> 01:58:35.000
You're going to starve under a bridge!

01:58:35.166 --> 01:58:38.083
And you, surrounded by stockings, panties,

01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:40.416
of worker blood stained waistcoats!

01:58:40.583 --> 01:58:42.833
Insolent, I'll break your mouth!

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.583
Oh yes?
Try and break your bones!

01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:48.500
I'm not a child!

01:59:10.375 --> 01:59:12.333
We will never see each other again.

01:59:16.583 --> 01:59:17.958
I did not know...

01:59:20.583 --> 01:59:23.125
I've always had
good intentions...

01:59:25.416 --> 01:59:27.958
Do not go away without
shaking hands.

01:59:37.458 --> 01:59:38.583
Do not go away.

01:59:39.125 --> 01:59:40.375
Please.

01:59:43.666 --> 01:59:44.458
No!

01:59:44.958 --> 01:59:46.291
Not like that!

01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:48.500
Like that!

01:59:53.958 --> 01:59:57.500
You went to France and
did not see it again.

01:59:57.666 --> 02:00:01.625
When he died, you did
not shed a single tear,

02:00:01.791 --> 02:00:05.791
but under your indifference,
your heart said to him...

02:00:05.958 --> 02:00:07.166
My father,

02:00:07.875 --> 02:00:11.125
not giving me anything, you gave me everything.

02:00:11.875 --> 02:00:13.125
Not loving me,

02:00:13.291 --> 02:00:16.166
You have taught me the
absolute necessity of love.

02:00:16.541 --> 02:00:17.875
By denying God,

02:00:18.041 --> 02:00:20.208
You taught me to value life.

02:00:21.041 --> 02:00:23.333
I forgive you, Jaime.

02:00:24.833 --> 02:00:28.875
You gave him the strength
to endure this world

02:00:29.041 --> 02:00:32.000
Where poetry no longer exists.

02:00:34.625 --> 02:00:36.208
Recognize your father.

02:00:37.458 --> 02:00:39.208
Remove her mask.

02:00:41.208 --> 02:00:42.958
It is not a seem,

02:00:43.625 --> 02:00:44.916
it is a being!

02:01:16.291 --> 02:01:17.750
Farewell, father.

02:01:18.666 --> 02:01:19.666
Thank you.

02:01:25.875 --> 02:01:27.041
Farewell, my son.

02:01:27.833 --> 02:01:29.041
I bless you.

02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:36.333
<i>If one of these days</i>

02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:39.375
<i>You are taken</i>

02:01:40.625 --> 02:01:44.208
<i>Of deep sorrow</i>

02:01:45.583 --> 02:01:50.500
<i>Let it go away</i>

02:01:51.375 --> 02:01:55.208
<i>Then Feel Again</i>

02:01:56.041 --> 02:02:00.916
<i>Vis the present</i>

02:02:33.666 --> 02:02:35.750
<i>I learned to be.</i>

02:02:37.208 --> 02:02:39.958
<i>I learned to love.</i>

02:02:40.125 --> 02:02:43.250
<i>I learned to create.</i>

02:02:44.416 --> 02:02:46.541
<i>I learned to live.</i>

02:02:47.708 --> 02:02:51.333
<i>All paths are my way.</i>

02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:56.458
<i>Opening my heart, I hear
the tears of the world.</i>

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.666
