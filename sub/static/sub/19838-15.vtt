<b><i>I have a duty to fulfill...</i></b>

00:07.740 --> 00:09.190
<b><i>I must give birth to the King!</i></b>

00:11.770 --> 00:14.990
<b><i>I am the Queen!</i></b>

01:34.990 --> 01:40.030
<b>Unease x And x Sighting</b>

01:41.480 --> 01:43.830
<b>After using Accompany,</b>

01:43.830 --> 01:48.040
<b>Gon and Killua were transported 
to Ging's student, Kite.</b>

01:48.760 --> 01:52.450
<b>After Gon remembered having 
met Kite years before,</b>

01:52.450 --> 01:55.120
<b>he felt that Ging intended 
for this meeting to occur,</b>

01:55.120 --> 01:57.410
<b>and his interest in Kite grew.</b>

01:59.360 --> 02:02.190
<b>Hey, what kind of work do you do, Kite?</b>

02:02.190 --> 02:03.810
<b>Biological surveying.</b>

02:04.130 --> 02:07.810
<b>I focus on discovering and 
researching new species.</b>

02:08.150 --> 02:10.360
<b>Oh, have you heard of the Camp Tiger?</b>

02:11.320 --> 02:12.820
<b>Camp Tiger?</b>

02:13.250 --> 02:14.950
<b>They can use fire.</b>

02:15.270 --> 02:18.320
<b>They use branches that have been 
ignited by lightning as live kindle.</b>

02:19.310 --> 02:22.670
<b>Other than certain Magical 
Beasts that walk on two legs,</b>

02:22.670 --> 02:24.150
<b>they're the first of their kind:</b>

02:24.550 --> 02:27.830
<b>animals that eat their meat cooked, not raw.</b>

02:28.200 --> 02:30.470
<b>Wow, they're really cooking it.</b>

02:30.470 --> 02:32.110
<b>They really are using fire!</b>

02:32.660 --> 02:34.120
<b>Hey, what else is there?</b>

02:34.640 --> 02:35.840
<b>Oh, yeah...</b>

02:36.430 --> 02:39.680
<b>You said the thing that attacked 
me was a Chimera Ant?</b>

02:40.630 --> 02:42.710
<b>Yes, a Chimera Ant.</b>

02:44.180 --> 02:46.720
<b>Under a class-1 quarantine.</b>

02:46.720 --> 02:50.910
<b>Normally, no one would be allowed 
near such a dangerous insect.</b>

02:51.240 --> 02:53.360
<b>Did you discover them?</b>

02:53.360 --> 02:56.640
<b>No, I specialize in larger creatures.</b>

02:56.930 --> 02:59.360
<b>But currently, I'm investigating these insects.</b>

03:00.380 --> 03:02.610
<b>Something has been bothering me...</b>

03:07.170 --> 03:11.620
<b>But it appears that now, I'll have 
to move to a different location.</b>

03:12.300 --> 03:15.630
<b>I must make a call, but I'm not 
getting any reception here.</b>

03:15.940 --> 03:17.060
<b>A call?</b>

03:17.650 --> 03:19.230
<b>I'm working with others.</b>

03:19.230 --> 03:21.130
<b>Seven of us are working as a team.</b>

03:21.620 --> 03:24.220
<b>I guess I must wait for their arrival.</b>

03:24.660 --> 03:26.410
<b>Once they're here, I'll introduce you.</b>

03:26.410 --> 03:29.390
<b>They're amateurs, but they're still skilled Hunters.</b>

03:34.160 --> 03:36.040
<b>Oh?</b>

03:36.700 --> 03:38.750
<b>Ah, speak of the devil.</b>

03:42.000 --> 03:44.690
<b>Kite, who are these kids?</b>

03:44.690 --> 03:46.100
<b>My friends.</b>

03:46.370 --> 03:48.410
<b>They dropped by for a visit on their travels.</b>

03:49.000 --> 03:51.870
<b>Oh, it's a pleasure to meet 
you all the way out here.</b>

03:51.870 --> 03:53.790
<b>I'm Spinner Clow.</b>

03:53.790 --> 03:55.230
<b>Call me Spin!</b>

03:55.230 --> 03:56.200
<b>Nice to meet you.</b>

03:56.540 --> 03:58.210
<b>I'm Gon Freecss.</b>

03:58.210 --> 03:59.800
<b>Nice to meet you, Spin.</b>

04:01.020 --> 04:02.710
<b>Freecss...</b>

04:03.010 --> 04:04.610
<b>Wait, is this...</b>

04:05.410 --> 04:07.640
<b>Yes, Ging-san's son.</b>

04:07.640 --> 04:09.010
<b>Really?!</b>

04:09.010 --> 04:11.390
<b>And you? Not you, too?</b>

04:11.660 --> 04:13.500
<b>No, not me.</b>

04:13.500 --> 04:15.150
<b>My name is Killua Zoldyck.</b>

04:15.650 --> 04:17.510
<b>Zoldyck...</b>

04:17.510 --> 04:22.650
<b>Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but are you 
part of the famous family of assassins?</b>

04:22.900 --> 04:25.400
<b>Yeah, but I quit.</b>

04:25.950 --> 04:28.280
<b>Additionally, they are both pro Hunters.</b>

04:28.600 --> 04:30.660
<b>So you should show some respect.</b>

04:30.660 --> 04:32.770
<b>Wow!</b>

04:35.510 --> 04:37.670
<b>Man, that was a shock!</b>

04:38.290 --> 04:41.960
<b>We've been conducting biological 
surveys with Kite for three years,</b>

04:41.960 --> 04:45.330
<b>but this is the most incredible 
organism we've ever seen!</b>

04:45.330 --> 04:47.180
<b>Yeah, no kidding...</b>

04:47.610 --> 04:49.770
<b>I don't think we finished our introductions.</b>

04:50.210 --> 04:52.120
<b>I'm Monta Yuras.</b>

04:52.120 --> 04:53.430
<b>But call me Mon.</b>

04:53.430 --> 04:55.190
<b>Nice to meet you, Mon.</b>

04:55.460 --> 04:57.320
<b>I'm Stick Dinner.</b>

04:57.320 --> 04:58.820
<b>I handle the cooking.</b>

04:58.820 --> 04:59.710
<b>Know why?</b>

04:59.710 --> 05:01.390
<b>Because my name is Dinner.</b>

05:03.870 --> 05:05.070
<b>Nice meeting you.</b>

05:05.490 --> 05:07.980
<b>My name is Banana Kavaro.</b>

05:08.360 --> 05:09.270
<b>Good to meet you.</b>

05:13.130 --> 05:15.740
<b>We have two others on our team.</b>

05:15.740 --> 05:17.330
<b>Where are Podungo and Lin?</b>

05:17.640 --> 05:20.590
<b>They're both headed toward 
the area of the sighting.</b>

05:20.590 --> 05:22.880
<b>They always move so fast.</b>

05:22.880 --> 05:26.220
<b>Oh, and you were right, Kite...</b>

05:27.820 --> 05:33.160
<b>This looks just like the claw 
of a Chimera Ant queen.</b>

05:35.960 --> 05:40.980
<b>We ran some computer analyses, 
and the result was a 99% match.</b>

05:41.410 --> 05:42.370
<b>Can I see it?</b>

05:42.370 --> 05:43.280
<b>Sure.</b>

05:45.450 --> 05:48.120
<b>This is a Chimera Ant claw?</b>

05:48.120 --> 05:49.850
<b>It's as big as a human finger.</b>

05:50.230 --> 05:52.240
<b>Does that mean there are huge ants?</b>

05:52.570 --> 05:53.990
<b>We don't know.</b>

05:53.990 --> 05:56.220
<b>Maybe one mutated and grew really big?</b>

05:56.220 --> 06:00.710
<b>That's possible, though it may also belong 
to a completely different species.</b>

06:01.590 --> 06:04.380
<b>Regardless, we just don't know right now.</b>

06:05.130 --> 06:06.980
<b>That's why we're investigating.</b>

06:08.660 --> 06:11.330
<b>It all started with the wonkiest little thing...</b>

06:11.330 --> 06:13.260
<b>His name was Won!</b>

06:13.260 --> 06:15.050
<b>He was a Kakin official.</b>

06:16.740 --> 06:18.380
<b>What's Kakin?</b>

06:18.380 --> 06:19.370
<b>Right here.</b>

06:19.370 --> 06:23.420
<b>It's this wild land, in the middle 
of the Azian continent.</b>

06:23.790 --> 06:27.310
<b>We had just completed a biological 
survey they had requested when...</b>

06:29.520 --> 06:31.030
<b><i>Magnificent.</i></b>

06:31.420 --> 06:35.600
<b><i>You've completed two hundred years' 
worth of work for this agency...</i></b>

06:35.600 --> 06:39.690
<b><i>To be honest, I regret that I am 
unable to pay you a bonus.</i></b>

06:39.690 --> 06:41.370
<b><i>Don't say that, Won-san.</i></b>

06:41.370 --> 06:42.920
<b><i>We enjoyed ourselves.</i></b>

06:43.540 --> 06:45.830
<b><i>In lieu of that,</i></b>

06:45.830 --> 06:50.430
<b><i>I'll be sure to recommend you 
to other friendly nations.</i></b>

06:50.800 --> 06:52.300
<b><i>We appreciate it.</i></b>

06:54.530 --> 06:56.450
<b><i>Oh, that's right!</i></b>

06:56.450 --> 06:58.330
<b><i>I'm going to ramble a bit.</i></b>

06:58.330 --> 07:02.440
<b><i>I believe part of a very strange species was 
brought to the Southern Piece auction...</i></b>

07:03.380 --> 07:06.350
<b><i>There's suspicion that it's from 
an unidentified organism,</i></b>

07:06.350 --> 07:08.430
<b><i>so the seller couldn't list it in the catalog,</i></b>

07:08.430 --> 07:12.450
<b><i>but since they'd have to donate it 
to a government agency otherwise,</i></b>

07:12.450 --> 07:16.530
<b><i>they hoped a licensed Hunter would 
buy it from them for a high price.</i></b>

07:22.480 --> 07:24.170
<b><i>Here you are.</i></b>

07:32.220 --> 07:33.660
<b><i>Well, Lin?</i></b>

07:33.660 --> 07:37.100
<b><i>Th-This clearly belongs to an 
unidentified organism, yes.</i></b>

07:37.670 --> 07:41.600
<b><i>F-From what I can see, 
it resembles an insect's leg...</i></b>

07:41.600 --> 07:46.090
<b><i>B-But no known insects have l-legs this large.</i></b>

07:46.920 --> 07:50.930
<b><i>And the claw exhibits traits 
not found among insects...</i></b>

07:52.030 --> 07:55.310
<b><i>A leg typically has two claws, but this has six.</i></b>

07:55.310 --> 07:59.370
<b><i>It almost looks as though the tarsi 
evolved into something like fingers?</i></b>

07:59.850 --> 08:04.880
<b><i>Yes, and this part is spiny, 
so it could be the tibia.</i></b>

08:05.280 --> 08:09.420
<b><i>If we take a sample and study 
it further, we'll learn more.</i></b>

08:09.800 --> 08:12.820
<b><i>Could you give us a small part?</i></b>

08:12.820 --> 08:16.920
<b><i>Since Won-san referred you 
to us, we cannot refuse.</i></b>

08:19.940 --> 08:22.090
<b><i>Let's look into this, then.</i></b>

08:22.090 --> 08:24.770
<b><i>We'll send you any results, once we have them.</i></b>

08:25.870 --> 08:26.960
<b><i>Appreciated.</i></b>

08:31.860 --> 08:33.080
<b>Chimera Ant...</b>

08:38.480 --> 08:40.790
<b>Where did Lin and Podungo go?</b>

08:41.220 --> 08:43.630
<b>Somewhere south of Yorknew City.</b>

08:44.300 --> 08:48.410
<b>The person who found the insect leg 
apparently lives in a city by the ocean.</b>

08:48.790 --> 08:52.800
<b>Sorry you won't be able to catch your breath, 
but we should hurry after them.</b>

08:53.090 --> 08:55.830
<b>Hey, can we come with you?</b>

08:55.830 --> 08:56.780
<b>Hmm?</b>

08:57.670 --> 08:58.860
<b>Sure.</b>

08:58.860 --> 09:00.060
<b>Yes!</b>

09:00.740 --> 09:02.390
<b>Glad to have you.</b>

09:02.390 --> 09:06.810
<b>Having two pro Hunters with us is reassuring.</b>

09:06.810 --> 09:10.180
<b>And this is Ging-san's son and 
one of the Zoldyck family!</b>

09:10.180 --> 09:11.730
<b>Oh, sorry...</b>

09:11.730 --> 09:13.120
<b>It's no big deal.</b>

09:16.560 --> 09:19.970
<b>Anyway, you kids are already pros at your age?</b>

09:19.970 --> 09:22.580
<b>We weren't born with the talent...</b>

09:22.580 --> 09:26.420
<b>Talent, talent... Guess I have a 
talent for saying "talent," huh?</b>

09:31.040 --> 09:33.840
<b><i>In this brief period of time, 
they've become friends.</i></b>

09:35.930 --> 09:38.340
<b><i>Good Hunters are well-liked by animals.</i></b>

09:39.210 --> 09:42.350
<b><i>And also blessed with good friends.</i></b>

09:46.270 --> 09:48.290
<b><i>Gon might be the real deal...</i></b>

09:48.960 --> 09:51.650
<b><i>He'll find you soon, Ging-san.</i></b>

10:17.860 --> 10:20.550
<b><i>Not enough... Not enough...</i></b>

10:20.780 --> 10:24.260
<b><i>I need more, bigger food.</i></b>

10:33.460 --> 10:35.110
<b>It's been days...</b>

10:35.110 --> 10:38.150
<b>No, it's been months since it last rained here.</b>

10:38.680 --> 10:40.810
<b>The weather is unusual this year.</b>

10:41.410 --> 10:46.290
<b>It's possible that this is affecting 
the wildlife in some way.</b>

10:47.080 --> 10:49.300
<b>So the insect with the large leg</b>

10:49.300 --> 10:52.670
<b>could have been a mutation 
influenced by those conditions.</b>

10:52.670 --> 10:54.790
<b>But why would it have grown larger?</b>

10:54.790 --> 10:56.790
<b>In order to survive, right?</b>

10:57.350 --> 11:00.680
<b>If it's bigger, it'd have a better 
chance of securing food.</b>

11:01.070 --> 11:04.350
<b>But that would mean it'd need more, as well.</b>

11:04.350 --> 11:08.100
<b>Being larger doesn't always aid survival.</b>

11:08.610 --> 11:10.330
<b>I believe that this is</b>

11:10.330 --> 11:13.310
<b>related to the Chimera Ant's unique 
nature, not to the environment.</b>

11:13.620 --> 11:14.770
<b>I agree.</b>

11:14.770 --> 11:19.570
<b>Because they reproduce in a way 
not found in any other organism.</b>

11:19.570 --> 11:21.110
<b>What do you mean?</b>

11:21.110 --> 11:24.660
<b>They reproduce through a special 
process known as phagogenesis.</b>

11:25.020 --> 11:26.950
<b>Phagogenesis?</b>

11:26.950 --> 11:27.660
<b>What's that?</b>

11:27.660 --> 11:30.280
<b>Phagogenesis</b>

11:29.070 --> 11:32.590
<b>When a Chimera Ant queen eats other organisms,</b>

11:32.590 --> 11:34.340
<b>she is able to pass traits on</b>

11:34.340 --> 11:37.250
<b>from those organisms to the next generation.</b>

11:39.380 --> 11:43.830
<b>And she can also eat multiple species</b>

11:43.830 --> 11:47.170
<b>to pass on a mix of genes to her offspring.</b>

11:49.530 --> 11:53.250
<b>With each feeding, she lays one to five eggs.</b>

11:53.750 --> 11:57.830
<b>The first generation of births has 
no reproductive capability,</b>

11:57.830 --> 12:00.300
<b>so they become worker or soldier ants.</b>

12:00.990 --> 12:06.220
<b>They work in service to the queen 
and her eventual successors.</b>

12:07.640 --> 12:11.790
<b>Those successors are the king and 
queen of the next generation.</b>

12:11.790 --> 12:15.880
<b>The queen is thus always looking to 
consume the genes of strong organisms,</b>

12:15.880 --> 12:19.550
<b>so she can pass them to her offspring.</b>

12:19.870 --> 12:24.780
<b>And she may consume any species she 
particularly likes to extinction.</b>

12:24.780 --> 12:26.170
<b>To extinction?!</b>

12:26.540 --> 12:29.050
<b>Yes, her voracious appetite can drive her</b>

12:29.050 --> 12:33.270
<b>to consume her own weight many 
times over, in a single day.</b>

12:33.820 --> 12:37.770
<b>That's why Chimera Ants are 
under a class-1 quarantine.</b>

12:38.240 --> 12:41.280
<b>So if she sets her eyes on you, you're finished?</b>

12:42.170 --> 12:46.140
<b>Judging from the size of that claw, 
her length is at least two meters.</b>

12:46.880 --> 12:49.660
<b>That thing could devour a human in no time.</b>

12:54.970 --> 12:57.170
<b>Yes, you are correct.</b>

13:03.840 --> 13:06.050
<b>Stay back! Go away!</b>

13:06.050 --> 13:07.930
<b>B-Big Brother...</b>

13:08.490 --> 13:10.520
<b>Reina, stay close to me.</b>

13:20.600 --> 13:21.670
<b>Take that!</b>

13:30.700 --> 13:32.170
<b>It's okay now.</b>

13:32.170 --> 13:34.330
<b>Thank you!</b>

13:34.330 --> 13:36.090
<b>You can count on your big brother.</b>

13:36.090 --> 13:38.620
<b>I'll always keep you safe!</b>

13:39.420 --> 13:40.290
<b>Yeah!</b>

13:40.930 --> 13:42.450
<b>Okay, let's go home.</b>

13:47.780 --> 13:50.340
<b>Hey, my brother was amazing!</b>

13:50.340 --> 13:52.310
<b>There was a big snake, but he was like,</b>

13:52.580 --> 13:54.730
<b>"Stay back! Go away!"</b>

13:54.730 --> 13:56.060
<b>Whack!</b>

13:56.320 --> 13:59.370
<b>Come now, don't wave your spoon around.</b>

13:59.810 --> 14:01.450
<b>It's bad manners.</b>

14:01.450 --> 14:03.500
<b>But that's what he did.</b>

14:03.500 --> 14:05.440
<b>Yes, yes. I know.</b>

14:06.700 --> 14:07.900
<b>That was very brave.</b>

14:07.900 --> 14:13.950
<b>If a big snake showed up, 
your mother might be too scared to move.</b>

14:14.400 --> 14:16.980
<b>You're truly a young man, Kurt.</b>

14:18.900 --> 14:19.960
<b>Yeah, I guess.</b>

14:21.500 --> 14:23.540
<b>You're already nine...</b>

14:24.450 --> 14:26.170
<b>And a reliable big brother.</b>

14:27.100 --> 14:30.470
<b>You must continue to look after Reina.</b>

14:31.110 --> 14:33.400
<b>I'm counting on you, Kurt.</b>

14:33.700 --> 14:36.170
<b>I'm counting on you, Brother.</b>

14:36.170 --> 14:37.730
<b>Yeah, you can count on me!</b>

14:38.420 --> 14:42.220
<b>I'll keep you both safe forever!</b>

14:52.730 --> 14:55.740
<b><i>This area is about to hatch.</i></b>

15:16.270 --> 15:18.610
<b>Soldiers, hear me!</b>

15:18.610 --> 15:21.520
<b>My duty is to give birth to the King.</b>

15:22.020 --> 15:23.940
<b>In order to give birth to a strong king,</b>

15:23.940 --> 15:28.130
<b>I require large quantities of highly nutritious food.</b>

15:28.650 --> 15:31.270
<b>Search out the best food you can find!</b>

15:38.540 --> 15:40.740
<b><i>This area will also hatch soon.</i></b>

15:41.710 --> 15:45.520
<b><i>I require a large nest in 
which to birth a strong king.</i></b>

15:45.520 --> 15:50.670
<b><i>I also need time to rest, free from concerns 
of outside disturbances, during the pregnancy.</i></b>

15:53.230 --> 15:58.040
<b><i>In order to give birth to a strong 
king, I need strong soldiers.</i></b>

16:04.390 --> 16:05.530
<b>Are you okay?</b>

16:05.530 --> 16:07.490
<b>Uh-huh, thank you...</b>

16:10.760 --> 16:12.450
<b>Hey, Brother...</b>

16:13.250 --> 16:17.330
<b>When I grow up, I'm gonna marry you.</b>

16:18.690 --> 16:19.530
<b>Sure.</b>

16:20.750 --> 16:23.920
<b>Let's wake up early tomorrow 
and go fishing at the river.</b>

16:24.500 --> 16:25.200
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:25.800 --> 16:29.840
<b>We can cook some fish to surprise Mom.</b>

16:30.490 --> 16:32.510
<b>Uh-huh, I can't wait.</b>

16:43.620 --> 16:47.220
<b>This is enough fish for a feast.</b>

16:47.220 --> 16:47.860
<b>Yep.</b>

16:55.960 --> 16:57.820
<b>B-Big Brother...</b>

17:02.490 --> 17:03.620
<b>Big Brother!</b>

17:04.150 --> 17:05.900
<b>Reina, it's okay.</b>

17:08.410 --> 17:09.420
<b>I'll...</b>

17:09.860 --> 17:12.770
<b>Your big brother will protect you!</b>

17:14.660 --> 17:16.720
<b>I promised Mom!</b>

17:17.520 --> 17:19.220
<b>I'll keep you safe!</b>

17:21.390 --> 17:22.620
<b>Go away...</b>

17:23.350 --> 17:24.480
<b>Go away!</b>

17:32.400 --> 17:34.490
<b><i>This is delicious,</i></b>

17:35.930 --> 17:37.640
<b><i>and very nutritious...</i></b>

17:37.640 --> 17:39.490
<b><i>The ultimate food.</i></b>

17:40.710 --> 17:43.250
<b><i>I need more of this species.</i></b>

17:47.180 --> 17:50.440
<b>They're the ones I mentioned on 
the phone, Gon and Killua.</b>

17:50.440 --> 17:53.140
<b>Oh, I'm Lin Koshi.</b>

17:53.140 --> 17:54.340
<b>N-Nice to meet you.</b>

17:54.790 --> 17:56.870
<b>My name's Podungo Lapoy.</b>

17:56.870 --> 17:58.890
<b>Glad to have you on board.</b>

17:59.330 --> 18:02.760
<b>Glad to be here, Lin-san, Podungo-san.</b>

18:02.760 --> 18:03.550
<b>Hey.</b>

18:04.230 --> 18:07.020
<b>Let's get down to business.
Where was the leg discovered?</b>

18:07.690 --> 18:09.810
<b>On the beach over there.</b>

18:09.810 --> 18:12.230
<b>A-According to the locals,</b>

18:12.230 --> 18:15.280
<b>it washed up on sh-shore.</b>

18:24.100 --> 18:26.210
<b>There's a forest right behind us...</b>

18:26.920 --> 18:30.670
<b>It'll be difficult to find the 
Chimera Ant if it ran in there.</b>

18:32.790 --> 18:36.070
<b>We can't be certain that it's still alive.</b>

18:36.070 --> 18:41.680
<b>We don't even know if it ended up 
on the same island its leg drifted to.</b>

18:42.490 --> 18:43.720
<b>Let's find out, then.</b>

18:47.810 --> 18:49.690
<b>Here, remember this scent.</b>

18:52.040 --> 18:53.190
<b>I'll help, too!</b>

18:53.570 --> 18:54.390
<b>Huh?</b>

18:56.070 --> 18:58.450
<b>His nose is as sharp as a dog's.</b>

19:17.250 --> 19:19.110
<b>He can't find anything...</b>

19:19.490 --> 19:21.890
<b>The scent may have disappeared.</b>

19:21.890 --> 19:23.720
<b>It was raining.</b>

19:24.170 --> 19:25.880
<b>I couldn't find anything, either.</b>

19:25.880 --> 19:27.980
<b>That means the Chimera Ant isn't here.</b>

19:29.290 --> 19:32.920
<b>It may have washed ashore elsewhere.</b>

19:34.040 --> 19:36.230
<b>In which direction do the currents flow here?</b>

19:36.890 --> 19:38.400
<b>It's complicated...</b>

19:38.400 --> 19:40.840
<b>The direction is reversed
between day and night.</b>

19:41.360 --> 19:43.100
<b>And it also changes with the seasons.</b>

19:43.100 --> 19:44.990
<b>I've even heard it's different on certain days.</b>

19:46.800 --> 19:49.500
<b>So it'll be tough to pinpoint a location...</b>

19:50.060 --> 19:51.950
<b>It's too early to give up.</b>

19:51.950 --> 19:53.540
<b>Let's split up and search.</b>

19:54.070 --> 19:55.000
<b>You're right.</b>

20:10.630 --> 20:12.130
<b>No luck...</b>

20:12.400 --> 20:15.020
<b>Continuing to search blindly is pointless.</b>

20:15.480 --> 20:17.330
<b>Let's return to Yorknew City.</b>

20:17.330 --> 20:21.160
<b>We may be able to find a new lead.</b>

20:35.500 --> 20:38.360
<b><i>Her length is at least two meters.</i></b>

20:38.800 --> 20:41.800
<b><i>That thing could devour a human in no time.</i></b>

20:43.210 --> 20:45.650
<b><i>A voracious appetite...</i></b>

20:45.650 --> 20:47.680
<b><i>Phagogenesis.</i></b>

21:06.090 --> 21:06.950
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

21:07.600 --> 21:10.450
<b>Oh, you can speak?</b>

21:11.320 --> 21:13.230
<b>So that I may fully receive,</b>

21:13.230 --> 21:16.820
<b>understand, and execute your orders.</b>

21:17.230 --> 21:18.590
<b>That pleases me.</b>

21:19.120 --> 21:22.720
<b>I assign you to be a squadron leader.</b>

21:23.370 --> 21:24.940
<b>I am most grateful.</b>

21:25.300 --> 21:26.470
<b>I already have your mission.</b>

21:26.710 --> 21:29.810
<b>Lead all the soldiers here on a mission</b>

21:30.290 --> 21:31.870
<b>to capture my food...</b>

21:32.820 --> 21:37.280
<b>Capture more of those highly 
nutritious organisms for me.</b>

21:37.600 --> 21:38.440
<b>At once!</b>

21:49.210 --> 21:53.500
<b>A Chimera Ant has been born with human genes.</b>

21:54.340 --> 21:58.680
<b>Kite's worst fears have been realized.</b>

23:27.370 --> 23:30.130
<b>Next time: Very x Rapid x Reproduction.</b>

23:30.130 --> 23:32.070
<b>My name is Gon Freecss.</b>

23:32.070 --> 23:33.760
<b>My name is Killua Zoldyck.</b>

23:34.280 --> 23:35.880
<b>What's your name?</b>
