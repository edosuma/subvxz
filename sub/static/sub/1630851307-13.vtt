WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.006
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:06.673 --> 00:09.509
Yes, daddy!

00:09.551 --> 00:11.636
No, I feel that we've got a good
friendship thing going.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.097
Yes!

00:14.139 --> 00:15.598
Mm.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.809
Thank you so much,
they're so nice.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.352
Need some help in the interior?

00:19.394 --> 00:22.188
-This is Delaney.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.524
I like her.
You are now a stewardess.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.444
You're... no, no.

00:27.485 --> 00:29.070
I don't want that girl
to be here.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.157
I blame Lexi for not pulling
her weight for us

00:32.198 --> 00:35.076
bringing on a fourth stew who's
now taken my ----ing cabin.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.871
For me, it's causing me
more stress than good.

00:37.912 --> 00:41.082
I think it would be best
if we say goodbye.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.084
But I want you
to stay the night.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.336
I want you to come out with us.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.378
Good luck, Katie.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.130
Oh!

00:48.757 --> 00:50.175
[gasps]
Dave!

00:53.887 --> 00:55.263
What, a doctor for a bruise?

00:55.305 --> 00:56.848
It's but a scratch, boys.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.225
Show us how you
talk to yourself.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.603
-You're a lowlife, literally.
-Oi, stop it.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.646
-But you are a horrible human.
-Your mother is.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.524
Yo, wake Lexi up, don't let
her sleep through the dinner.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.402
I just wanna pay for
anyone but Lexi.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.445
Stop!

01:11.946 --> 01:13.573
-I hate that word.
-But I hate you.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.658
My grandma was a
special education teacher,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.744
and she'd tell her
she had bad parents.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.245
No, my parents are amazing.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.330
Your parents should
have aborted you.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.706
[gasps]

01:21.748 --> 01:23.124
You're a dick,
you're ugly as [bleep].

01:23.166 --> 01:24.876
Whoa.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.252
And if this wasn't on camera,
I would have smacked your ass.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.629
-You should have.
-There you go.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.344
The real bitch is out now.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.388
He thinks he is ----ing G,
I'm the real G.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.264
Better ask about me.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.516
Mathew!

01:39.557 --> 01:40.850
-Mat.
-We ----ing love you,

01:40.892 --> 01:42.560
so don't ----ing
ruin it on this night,

01:42.602 --> 01:44.354
because I swear to God both
should have got fired

01:44.396 --> 01:46.272
-the first time, so...
-A hundred percent.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.650
You've, like, worked yourself
back, and we all respect that.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.443
So don't ----ing ruin it
tonight, okay?

01:50.485 --> 01:51.528
All right, thank you.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.779
That's a disgusting word to say.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.572
She should know better.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.835
Welcome back,
the worst person in the world.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.878
You wanna start again, Mat?
Because I'm a real bitch.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.296
-Stop!
-No, Lexi...

02:10.338 --> 02:11.923
I will smack
the [bleep] outta you.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.466
My bill...

02:13.508 --> 02:14.467
my bank account says
Lexi ----ing Wilson.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.386
Nobody cares about money.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.888
Honestly, Lexi, right, I'm
gonna say this to your face...

02:18.930 --> 02:21.391
it's honestly disgusting when
you talk to people like that,

02:21.433 --> 02:25.228
and I swear to God, everybody
in this whole place is actually,

02:25.270 --> 02:27.313
like, gobsmacked by the things
that come out of your mouth.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.648
No, no, I'm gonna stop you,

02:28.690 --> 02:29.983
because you're always
saying stop...

02:30.025 --> 02:31.401
everybody says stop,
and everybody says stop

02:31.443 --> 02:32.402
that's, like, really rude.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.445
No, no...

02:34.612 --> 02:35.864
-Yeah.
-Are you ----ing joking?

02:35.905 --> 02:37.282
Yes, I am dead-ass serious,

02:37.323 --> 02:38.575
because he is rude as [bleep]

02:38.616 --> 02:40.285
and you guys have
been giving him a pass.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.494
No, he'd never say
anybody should be aborted.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.329
No, you guys are giving
him a pass,

02:43.371 --> 02:46.666
because when he says ----ed-up
sh-- you guys let it slide.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.917
I just told him
he should have been fired

02:47.959 --> 02:49.586
when you should have been fired.

02:49.627 --> 02:50.879
So, neither of you are
getting special attention.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.630
Lex, if I'm gonna be honest,

02:52.672 --> 02:55.216
you are rude to every
single one of us.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.010
-That's not true.
-Yeah.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.970
Yo, I'm just gonna tell Sandy
it's either me or her tomorrow.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.933
Stop, oh, my God,
what is wrong with you?

03:03.975 --> 03:05.518
What is wrong with people?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.395
Lexi, sit back and chill out.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.442
Sorry for saying the "C" word,
but that is so disgusting.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.526
You just said the [bleep] word.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.527
"The [bleep] word."

03:14.569 --> 03:16.237
Do you wanna be here, though?

03:16.279 --> 03:17.614
Do you wanna be here?
Like, do you like all of us?

03:17.655 --> 03:19.282
Do you actually wanna be
here and work with us?

03:19.324 --> 03:20.658
Actually, that's not
your question to ask.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.370
-Yeah.
-She's the worst human ever.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.913
You're not my superior
in any way.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.539
I understand you wanna go hard,

03:26.581 --> 03:28.291
but [bleep]
you can't ----ing twerk,

03:28.333 --> 03:30.043
you're wack, and you're
shady as [bleep].

03:30.085 --> 03:32.379
Here we go...
hey, hey, hey.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.297
And you're ----ing shady.
You can't do your job.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.298
You were only given it
because you're being nice.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.549
Says you!

03:36.591 --> 03:37.550
You can't make any
----ing drinks.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.885
Oh, my God.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.512
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
okay, stop, stop.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.888
-You can't make any drinks...
-Stop, Lexi.

03:41.930 --> 03:42.889
You don't know
what you're doing...

03:42.931 --> 03:43.973
Stop. Stop.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.975
Okay, bitches, we're going.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.727
Yay!

03:47.769 --> 03:49.813
Best news I've
heard all night.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.404
I refuse to work
another day with her.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.280
-I'm not working.
-I hate him!

03:59.322 --> 04:01.741
Thank you so much for
this beautiful evening.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.618
Thank you, thank you.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.582
I honestly think me and
Katie could ----ing smash

04:09.624 --> 04:11.418
the next two ----ing trips,
the two of us.

04:11.459 --> 04:14.546
If anyone deserves
the "C" word, it's her.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.756
My ----ing gut, I am sick of it.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.591
Well, the whole ----ing night's
been sh--

04:18.633 --> 04:20.301
because of all this
----ing negative energy.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.302
I'm sorry.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.470
Yeah, I know.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.889
Like, I'm just over Mathew.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.560
But Lexi, I wanna say to you
I don't disagree that,

04:28.601 --> 04:30.353
like, when Mathew gets
drunk he does say

04:30.395 --> 04:31.813
some very offensive things.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.024
But then what happens
is he'll say something,

04:34.065 --> 04:36.067
and then you'll stoop low.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.445
And unfortunately,
you don't remember

04:38.486 --> 04:40.071
the night in the hot tub.

04:44.034 --> 04:44.993
You are being a kiss-ass.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.578
-Listen...
-Hey, oh!

04:46.619 --> 04:48.872
And that's why that
van backs Mathew.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.875
If that night didn't happen
and Mat was saying the sh--

04:51.916 --> 04:54.336
that he said, maybe people
would be having your back.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.004
-No, I get it.
-But...

04:56.046 --> 04:57.922
She didn't have to explain
that to me, I already knew that.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.966
I don't care if we come out of
this as no friends, non-friends.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.093
I didn't come
into yachting to hold hands

05:02.135 --> 05:03.636
and be friends with anyone.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.890
I don't know!

05:06.931 --> 05:09.142
"You don't pay my bills!
You don't pay my bills!"

05:09.184 --> 05:11.561
I also just wanna say,
like, drop the whole, like...

05:11.603 --> 05:12.937
-Yeah.
-Money thing.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.028
There are people around
the table that aren't

05:20.070 --> 05:21.571
-as fortunate.
-I understand, yeah.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.366
"You're so ----ing poor!"

05:29.829 --> 05:31.414
Meh, something just fell.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.839
Oh, come on, grandpa.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.882
Our favorite cripple.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.469
Wait, I'll take the roses,

05:44.511 --> 05:45.762
because you bought me
them, thank you.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.602
Hey, tonight was ----ed, eh?
I had to leave.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.771
Like, I... I couldn't be part
of that conversation.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.022
Are you okay?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.023
Do you want some Icy Hot
for your leg?

05:57.065 --> 05:58.650
No, no, no, it's fine.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.402
Oh, hi, how are you?

06:03.655 --> 06:05.615
It was weird vibes,
though, eh?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.120
I don't help at all.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.706
There's nothing left of me
to give this situation.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.499
I just do not give a [bleep].

06:15.917 --> 06:16.918
Yeah.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.671
-Yeah, and...
-Yeah, totally.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.964
I don't think Mathew's innocent.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.507
No, totally not.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.842
But hers just happened to be...

06:23.883 --> 06:25.218
More, like, repulsive.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.636
-Yeah.
-And more, like, psycho.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.471
Yeah.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.931
All of us tell Mathew to shut
the [bleep] up all the time.

06:29.973 --> 06:30.932
Yeah, mm-hmm.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.642
But it's how you do it.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.103
I mean, like, it's
so ridiculous, like...

06:35.145 --> 06:37.063
I don't think
she gets it, you know?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.523
I think she's just like, yeah,

06:38.565 --> 06:40.066
I get it, blah, blah,
blah, but...

06:40.108 --> 06:41.151
She's just says that
and kind of rolls her eyes.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.193
Yeah.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.659
If I was captain and I was
looking at it, that's your chef.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.453
Not easily replaceable.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.624
And we can do it with a
stew down; it'd just be hard.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.751
But we can't do it
without a chef.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.127
We can't do it without a chef.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.879
And those two are not
gonna work together.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.881
No, he's made that very clear,
and...

07:02.922 --> 07:04.632
-She's made that very clear.
-She's made that very clear.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.925
This is ----ed.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.640
You know what, I'm kinda
like now that I, like,

07:12.682 --> 07:14.768
I just went off on him,
I just...

07:14.809 --> 07:17.062
I really hope he
doesn't think anyone

07:17.103 --> 07:18.646
is intimidated or
scared by him.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.982
Ooh.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.734
I told you what went wrong.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.028
Like, that's why I told you
I want rich friends,

07:25.070 --> 07:27.197
because there's no conniving.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.948
Every time I
have a friend that's,

07:28.990 --> 07:32.243
like, not rich,
they try to ruin me.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.536
Back from the dead.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.625
I would love to say goodbye
to all of you tomorrow.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.795
Delaney, you've been
an absolute treat.

07:41.836 --> 07:42.962
Thank you for
your help, honestly.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.881
Yeah.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.633
I've been in your same position,
where I had to help interior,

07:46.675 --> 07:48.593
and I probably didn't take
it as well as you did.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.636
And you honestly...

07:49.678 --> 07:50.637
-Yeah, you did.
-You did.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.138
Your attitude was amazing,

07:52.180 --> 07:53.306
you came and you put
your head down, obviously.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.934
It was a lot.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.812
Thank you for your words,
and I'm glad I learned

07:58.853 --> 08:02.816
some new things and how to do
some new things in the laundry.

08:02.857 --> 08:03.858
All right, good night, guys.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.154
Yeah.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.543
Shift.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.878
Where is everyone?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.213
-Smoking on the bow?
-Yeah.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.883
Yeah.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.012
No, don't worry about my leg.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.054
I love you all.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.682
Good night, Dave-O.

08:35.724 --> 08:36.808
Let's go to bed.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.563
Oof.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.189
Dave.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.941
-All right, good night, guys.
-Good night, sweet dreams.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.161
You all good?

08:57.412 --> 08:59.247
-I'm just, like...
-I just...

08:59.289 --> 09:01.708
I have nothing to say about...
not... the... there's not...

09:01.750 --> 09:02.876
-Yeah, no, I know.
-Everything, you know.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.294
Yeah.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.881
I just... I don't think
there's a point of me

09:07.922 --> 09:10.133
even trying right now, because
I think the damage is done.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.598
Home sweet home.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.726
-Hello?
-Yeah.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.727
Hey.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.062
Is everything good?

09:22.103 --> 09:23.897
No, I told you that
the chef was, like,

09:23.938 --> 09:27.859
he says a lot of ----ed
up things, and it's okay.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.320
-I would make him cry...
-No.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.781
Like, and I know it, I could see
it in his eyes, his personality.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.282
He's a weak person.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.787
Mom, stop saying
"preacher's kid."

09:38.828 --> 09:40.413
That doesn't mean
anything anymore.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.667
Dad died, so it's, like...
you know me my whole life.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.919
Do you know me, to let
someone just be mean to me,

09:45.960 --> 09:47.087
and I don't say nothing?

09:47.128 --> 09:48.672
Come on, you know me.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.757
They're like,
"Oh, you should be fired."

09:50.799 --> 09:52.759
I was like, "if anyone needs
to be fired,

09:52.801 --> 09:55.136
we all need to be fired
for every single word."

09:55.178 --> 09:57.180
Everyone should be fired
at this point

09:57.222 --> 09:59.307
for insubordination...
everyone.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.103
Coming up...

10:03.144 --> 10:04.813
He said last night that he's
gonna give you an ultimatum...

10:04.854 --> 10:05.814
either him or me.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.440
If you give me an ultimatum,

10:07.482 --> 10:09.401
you can pack your ----ing sh--
and walk off the boat.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.243
They're trying everything in
their power to get me fired.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.829
Everyone should be fired

10:20.870 --> 10:21.830
at this point for
insubordination...

10:21.871 --> 10:23.373
everyone.

10:23.415 --> 10:27.335
I think I better go to bed,
I have work, fortunately.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.005
Or if they're trying to fire me,
so I don't know.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.382
There is no apologies
gonna be made on my end,

10:32.424 --> 10:34.384
because I've had it with him

10:34.426 --> 10:37.887
and I'm not gonna apologize to
him in any way, shape, or form.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.331
Do you think I could get you

11:05.373 --> 11:06.374
to help me carry
my suitcase off the boat?

11:06.416 --> 11:08.251
-Yeah.
-That'd be epic.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.424
I woke up and I got cramp
in my calf muscle,

11:14.466 --> 11:15.925
and it was a combination
of, like,

11:15.967 --> 11:17.886
the two worst kind of pains.

11:20.305 --> 11:23.975
I always tell myself it's fine,

11:24.017 --> 11:27.354
and then just kind of, like,
just try and just push through,

11:27.395 --> 11:29.105
and just it will
be fine, usually.

11:31.900 --> 11:32.984
Open.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.402
Hi!

11:34.444 --> 11:35.904
Hi, I'm just leaving,
I wanted to say goodbye.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.405
-You're leaving now?
-Yeah, yeah.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.157
I don't have on any
makeup or anything.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.242
-Yeah, just gimme a big hug.
-Oh!

11:41.284 --> 11:42.869
Bye.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.372
I don't think Lexi's
a bad person,

11:45.413 --> 11:46.873
but she definitely
said some things that I, like,

11:46.915 --> 11:48.249
wildly do not agree with.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.293
So, I don't know
if I'd be BFFs with her,

11:50.335 --> 11:53.046
just because I think
we have very different values

11:53.088 --> 11:54.172
about a lot of things.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.882
Well, thank you for everything.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.425
-Thank you, too.
-Yeah.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.510
I'm sorry for everybody.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.969
No, honestly, it was...

12:00.011 --> 12:01.513
-It was very...
-It was fun.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.556
Honestly, I'm stoked to be
back in my ----ing bed

12:03.598 --> 12:06.309
My leg's ----ing so sore
climbing up the bunks.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.144
I have a definitely
new appreciation

12:08.186 --> 12:10.897
for all interior crew
forever and ever

12:10.939 --> 12:11.940
and ever and ever and ever.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.316
-That's good!
-Yeah.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.151
Working in yachting,
this is what happens.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.528
You just gotta keep going.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.405
Thank you for coming
into this crazy mess.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.365
It's much appreciated.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.367
Find your next boat,
find your next captain...

12:22.409 --> 12:24.160
you'll prove yourself.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.459
Absolutely not.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.503
Dude, I'm taking that
----ing off my CV.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.923
It's filler, and clearly
it's just confusing people.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.179
Morning.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.850
Oh, you wanna talk to me?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.476
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, okay.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.894
But no...
but honestly, it's no rush.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.146
You get ready
and whatever, and...

12:51.187 --> 12:52.939
Oh, okay.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.109
Is everyone else up?

12:56.151 --> 12:57.277
Actually, yeah,
everyone's awake.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.903
I just haven't seen Mzi or Lexi.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.864
That was awkward last night.

13:00.905 --> 13:01.865
Yeah.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.199
What do you reckon?

13:03.241 --> 13:04.200
Are you guys gonna
talk to Captain Sandy?

13:04.242 --> 13:06.036
Yeah.

13:06.077 --> 13:09.247
Between you two, it just starts
with, like, something little,

13:09.289 --> 13:11.583
and then it grew
from there, you know?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.251
Mm-hmm.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.879
And, like, when you guys
start insulting each other,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.380
while neither of it is...

13:17.422 --> 13:19.007
Was I insulting her, though?

13:19.049 --> 13:21.092
Uh, yeah.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.927
I was saying she was
a horrible person.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.138
No, you're a horrible human,
and no one likes you here.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.891
-I don't like you.
-Yeah.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.976
I feel bad about my behavior,

13:30.018 --> 13:31.895
because, like, it ruined
everyone else's time, too.

13:31.936 --> 13:35.940
But I'm not gonna apologize.
I meant exactly what I said.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.442
I don't really
wanna be around her.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.279
Most people who talk like that.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.447
-Morning.
-Morning.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.201
How are you this morning?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.250
Oh [bleep].

13:54.292 --> 13:55.543
Where are the guys at?

13:55.585 --> 13:59.047
I have a feeling
they're just coming now.

13:59.089 --> 14:02.467
Did the girls speak to Sandy
last night, Captain Sandy?

14:02.509 --> 14:03.927
Not last night.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.555
Gentlemen, so first
things first...

14:07.597 --> 14:09.724
last night was a night.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.226
Everyone okay?

14:11.267 --> 14:13.978
You're alive, Mzi.

14:14.020 --> 14:18.400
As your head of department, if
anyone does have any concern,

14:18.441 --> 14:19.984
you can always come to me,

14:20.026 --> 14:21.569
and then I can bring
that to Captain Sandy.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.738
I don't want anyone on here
to feel like they can't

14:23.780 --> 14:26.324
voice a complaint or
be upset by something.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.327
Yeah, I was
absolutely shattered.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.996
This time, she can't say she was
so drunk she doesn't remember.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.415
It's true, she was sober.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.334
That comment surprised me,
the abortion thing,

14:36.376 --> 14:39.129
and it affects me more,
because in the last year,

14:39.170 --> 14:41.715
I've become quite anxious, and
then I don't like aggressive,

14:41.756 --> 14:43.341
violent situations anyway.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.427
Just being around
everyone shouting,

14:45.468 --> 14:47.429
it's my idea of
my worst nightmare.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.597
You never should have
to just be okay with some things

14:49.639 --> 14:52.267
that are inappropriate.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.685
That's that.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.438
And then today,
we have a boat to wash.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.647
Ye.

14:57.689 --> 15:01.317
Katie, Katie,
when you have a minute,

15:01.359 --> 15:02.736
<i>I'm ready for</i>
<i>that conversation.</i>

15:02.777 --> 15:04.612
<i>Copy, Captain Sandy,</i>

15:04.654 --> 15:06.489
<i>I'll be up in about</i>
<i>five minutes to the bridge.</i>

15:07.490 --> 15:09.409
Why did I leave bottle service?

15:09.451 --> 15:11.327
-Ugh.
-Are you gonna be okay?

15:11.369 --> 15:13.121
-It's much better today.
-Okay.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.498
Today it's more sore.
Yesterday was pure pain, ooh.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.125
Ooh.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.461
[bleep] I'm scared.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.629
You know, myself and Malia
are the ones

15:21.671 --> 15:24.174
that are responsible
that explain to the captain

15:24.215 --> 15:25.467
why there's a weird
dynamic on board,

15:25.508 --> 15:26.468
or why something's happening.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.136
Captains aren't stupid,

15:28.178 --> 15:29.637
they pick up sh-- even
if they're not around.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.557
What now?

15:32.599 --> 15:35.143
So, yesterday was
such a sh-- show.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.645
The thing is, like,
it was sort of Mat and Lexi.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.105
I mean, they already
have this

15:39.147 --> 15:40.106
they don't really
like each other.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.441
They went at it.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.692
Where?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.694
They started at lunch
at the falls,

15:44.736 --> 15:46.488
so after we'd walked
around, we had lunch.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.739
Who started it?

15:47.781 --> 15:49.324
I don't actually
know who started it.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.534
I know Mat,
he's not a victim in this.

15:51.576 --> 15:56.623
* Show your true colors,
and that's why I hate you *

15:56.664 --> 16:00.168
They're both bad, and
they both fuel the fire.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.336
Mm-hmm.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.254
Lexi obviously
takes the comments

16:03.296 --> 16:05.674
and the things she says
to a whole new level.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.677
And then at dinner it
kicked off, like, properly.

16:08.718 --> 16:12.389
She pretty much told him he
should have been aborted.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.431
She called him the "R" word.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.184
Ugh ----ing hell, bro.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.769
This is ridiculous.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.689
I don't really know, like,
who started it completely,

16:20.730 --> 16:23.149
but I know it was both sides,
it wasn't just...

16:23.191 --> 16:24.526
Well, did you hear anything
that Mathew said,

16:24.567 --> 16:25.735
or only what Lexi said?

16:25.777 --> 16:27.529
Yeah, no, he
said stuff as well.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.656
He just says, "No one likes
you," and stuff like that.

16:29.698 --> 16:32.200
And she did say some sh--
to Courtney as well,

16:32.242 --> 16:33.785
because Courtney kind of
stood up and was, like,

16:33.827 --> 16:35.161
"I'm so ----ing sick
of this," like,

16:35.203 --> 16:36.538
"you were both in the wrong."

16:36.579 --> 16:38.331
"Like, you both
should have been fired,

16:38.373 --> 16:39.833
but you're both still here."

16:39.874 --> 16:42.544
And then Lexi kind of called
Courtney lazy and sh--

16:42.585 --> 16:45.755
at her job, and I was, like,
that's definitely not the case.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.757
And I've come you neutral,
just so you're aware,

16:47.799 --> 16:50.093
because that is an
ongoing problem, obviously,

16:50.135 --> 16:51.845
and, you know,
people saying

16:51.886 --> 16:54.222
they can't work with her
or vice-versa.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.725
Here's what I wanna do.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.436
I wanna get Mathew, Lexi,
and you in the main salon.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.770
-Mm-hmm.
-Then we're gonna have a talk.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.313
Yeah.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.732
Even though the crew are
out for dinner,

17:03.773 --> 17:05.567
they still represent the vessel,

17:05.608 --> 17:10.280
so their behavior has to emulate
what you would be on board.

17:10.321 --> 17:14.242
Mathew, Lexi, and Katie, we're
all meeting in the bridge salon.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.744
-Copy.
-Copy.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.912
I must maintain
that within the crew.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.414
Sometimes it doesn't happen,

17:19.456 --> 17:21.124
and that's when
I have to fire people.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.585
Hola.

17:23.626 --> 17:27.297
-No, sit there.
-Oh.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.595
Coming up...

17:33.636 --> 17:35.263
-Tell me why you're limping.
-I fell.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.266
Let me see your injury.
That's a major injury.

17:43.313 --> 17:43.897
Mathew, Lexi, and Katie,

17:46.524 --> 17:48.318
we're all meeting in
the bridge salon.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.404
Hola.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.865
-No, sit there.
-Oh.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.830
Yesterday, you guys had
an incredible day planned

18:00.872 --> 18:03.750
to go watersports,

18:03.792 --> 18:07.587
Krka Falls, beautiful lunch,
beautiful dinner.

18:07.629 --> 18:11.800
How does it turn
into fighting?

18:11.841 --> 18:12.801
Do you want...
can I speak?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.427
Yes.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.428
So, I don't know, Mathew
has been attacking me

18:15.470 --> 18:17.263
from second charter,

18:17.305 --> 18:21.476
and yesterday I literally tried
to avoid him like the plague,

18:21.518 --> 18:22.852
because he'd been
drinking that morning.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.230
So, you woke up and
started drinking?

18:25.271 --> 18:26.940
-Everyone did.
-Fine.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.525
Who started it?

18:28.566 --> 18:31.361
Mathew. He says stuff
to get under my skin.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.571
"Oh, I don't want her here,
nobody likes you,

18:33.613 --> 18:35.990
why are you here, we should
switch Delaney for you,"

18:36.032 --> 18:37.367
And you agree, you heard it.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.952
Yeah, I'm... yeah.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.829
He was saying that all day,
just trying to irk with me.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.831
I disagree.
She feeds off it.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.541
Since the first charter,
we didn't get along.

18:44.582 --> 18:45.959
We had issues in the galley.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.752
She called me a [bleep].

18:47.794 --> 18:49.921
She told me I should have
been aborted multiple times.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.798
I said your mom shouldn't have
brought you in this world,

18:51.840 --> 18:52.799
because the thing...
he's disgusting.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.342
You said...

18:54.384 --> 18:55.552
no, you said, "Your mum should
have... "

18:55.593 --> 18:57.303
-And he...
-"... aborted you..."

18:57.345 --> 18:58.346
-And he said...
-and you said that a few times.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.848
Well, he says very wild stuff,

18:59.889 --> 19:01.891
and I feel like he gets a
pass because he's liked.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.685
You do provoke each other.

19:03.727 --> 19:04.728
It was from the first charter
we didn't get along.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.937
None of you are innocent
in this.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.814
No, none of us are innocent

19:07.856 --> 19:08.815
but he was poking me
the whole day.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.442
Can I please speak?

19:10.483 --> 19:11.735
I think where people get
so aggressive towards you,

19:11.776 --> 19:13.445
or, like, whatever it is,

19:13.486 --> 19:15.405
because if Mathew says something
to you, your reaction,

19:15.447 --> 19:17.282
Lexi, goes to
a whole nother level.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.700
That's why people
are siding with him.

19:18.742 --> 19:19.951
They're harboring old feelings,

19:19.993 --> 19:21.619
and I feel like
I can never get...

19:21.661 --> 19:23.997
-Yeah, so it kind of...
-...those old feelings gone.

19:24.039 --> 19:24.998
Well, I was called
a [bleep] last night.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.082
-So...
-By whom?

19:26.124 --> 19:27.959
Courtney.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.794
That word's thrown around a lot,
but if I say it, it's bad.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.838
Oh, my gosh,
if you feel attacked,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.506
you go to your chief stew.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.924
If you're not getting
any help from her,

19:34.966 --> 19:36.301
you come straight to me.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.761
Your work ethic, for me,

19:37.802 --> 19:40.055
in my eyes, you're there
for the guests, okay?

19:40.096 --> 19:41.931
That's what I see.

19:41.973 --> 19:46.770
What I'm hearing is that you
are difficult to live with now.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.104
I find it very difficult
to work with her

19:48.146 --> 19:50.690
-in the galley and on service.
-Okay.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.025
Well, he said last night
that he's gonna

19:52.067 --> 19:53.985
give you an ultimatum...
either him or me.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.405
Is that true?

19:57.447 --> 19:58.615
Did you not say that?

19:58.656 --> 20:01.701
I said that at
the moment, yeah.

20:01.743 --> 20:05.497
I don't wanna be ever
given an ultimatum.

20:07.665 --> 20:08.875
-Ever.
-Yeah.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.752
And if you give me an ultimatum,

20:10.794 --> 20:12.712
you can pack you're ----ing
sh-- and walk off the boat.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.048
-Yeah.
-That's how I feel.

20:15.090 --> 20:18.343
Because I will never be
given that ultimatum.

20:20.512 --> 20:21.805
You can go, you're dismissed.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.812
<i>Courtney and Malia,</i>
<i>come to the bridge deck salon.</i>

20:28.853 --> 20:30.647
You can go.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.399
Do you think we all have
to go for this meeting?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.610
On my way.

20:38.697 --> 20:41.366
Did you call Lexi a [bleep]?

20:41.408 --> 20:43.910
It came out by accident,
but it wasn't...

20:43.952 --> 20:46.454
I said... as soon as it came
out, I was like,

20:46.496 --> 20:47.789
"Sorry, I did not mean
to call you that."

20:51.543 --> 20:52.836
Sorry for saying the "C" word.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.879
I did get angry
because I feel like

20:54.921 --> 20:56.673
I've been biting my tongue
a lot this whole season.

20:56.715 --> 21:00.552
How can such a beautiful day
turn into such a disaster?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.512
Them two are,
like, at each other.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.556
They were both in the wrong.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.850
She said things to Mat,
she said things to Mzi now.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.768
She told Mat
he should have been aborted.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.522
And he said things back.
I'm not defending him.

21:12.564 --> 21:13.898
You know what
I find interesting?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.650
How everybody starts with Lexi.

21:15.692 --> 21:19.654
It's like I understand
she's got a problem,

21:19.696 --> 21:22.407
but no one starts with Mathew.

21:22.449 --> 21:25.827
They both stooped
really low last night,

21:25.869 --> 21:28.121
but the problem is this
isn't her first time.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.164
It's coming off the back
of that first night...

21:29.205 --> 21:30.832
Okay.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.459
Where she literally picked
a fight with everyone.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.960
She pushed Mzi the first night.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.211
-You're being a kiss-ass!
-No, listen...

21:35.253 --> 21:36.838
Hey, oh! Enough!

21:36.880 --> 21:38.840
She threatened
to slap Mathew last night.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.425
I will smack
the [bleep] outta you.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.426
Do it.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.886
She gets super, super nasty.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.013
You know, then other
people stand up to, like,

21:45.055 --> 21:46.973
butt in, and then she
starts going at them.

21:47.015 --> 21:50.060
But I do think Mathew
instigated it last night.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.437
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.691
Lexi, Lexi,
to the bridge deck aft.

22:03.865 --> 22:05.033
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.452
Oh, Lexi.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.956
-From what I've seen...
-Mm-hmm.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.667
You're a terrific human being.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.835
Now, I don't go out
and drink with you,

22:15.877 --> 22:17.587
-And I don't go out and...
-Right.

22:17.629 --> 22:21.508
...have these experiences.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.843
Threatening people, saying
the things that you say...

22:23.885 --> 22:27.180
I told him I would smack him,
but I didn't really mean that.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.933
Considering how it's permeated
through the entire boat...

22:29.974 --> 22:31.685
Mm-hmm.

22:31.726 --> 22:32.852
And some people just
can't get around it...

22:32.894 --> 22:33.895
Yeah.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.772
Worst human I've ever met.

22:35.814 --> 22:38.066
-The many outweigh the one.
-Mm-hmm.

22:38.108 --> 22:41.778
And I have to
make a hard decision,

22:41.820 --> 22:43.697
and it's not easy for me.

22:54.749 --> 22:56.042
Considering how it's permeated
through the entire boat,

22:58.586 --> 23:00.672
threatening people,
saying the things that you say,

23:00.714 --> 23:04.050
I have to make a hard decision.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.218
I have to let you go.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.015
It's... it'll be weird
staying...

23:10.056 --> 23:11.850
It... I agree.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.852
Because they have their gel
and I don't fit in the gel.

23:13.893 --> 23:17.022
When you get in people's faces
and threaten them physically,

23:17.063 --> 23:19.858
especially in a workplace,
that will never work for you.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.902
That's something that I would
really take a hard look at.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.113
But the reality is,
I'm really sorry that this...

23:25.155 --> 23:26.614
I know.

23:26.656 --> 23:27.615
...came to this, because
I wanted to finish

23:27.657 --> 23:28.825
with my original crew.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.288
Thank you.
Gimme a hug.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.998
You're a good person.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.667
You just have
some things to learn.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.211
-I know, but Mathew?
-I know, he's not...

23:40.253 --> 23:42.213
-Ugh!
-I know, don't worry.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.049
I came to my decision
to let Lexi go

23:44.090 --> 23:46.968
because Lexi crossed the line.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.595
<i>Malia, Malia,</i>
<i>come to the crew mess.</i>

23:48.636 --> 23:50.221
<i>Copy, on my way.</i>

23:50.263 --> 23:52.140
If I have a crewmember
that's poking the bear

23:52.182 --> 23:54.934
when they're off the boat,
they need to figure that out.

23:54.976 --> 23:56.811
That's not for me to resolve.

23:56.853 --> 24:00.690
And if I have one person that's
disturbing the entire crew,

24:00.732 --> 24:02.817
I need to let go
of that person.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.235
Katie, Katie,
come to the crew mess.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.862
<i>On my way.</i>

24:05.904 --> 24:07.322
It's okay, I can do stairs
and sh-- now.

24:07.364 --> 24:08.948
But it's only, like,
actually, if anything,

24:08.990 --> 24:11.826
just ----ing presses,
like, on it.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.661
Thank you.
Appreciate that.

24:16.206 --> 24:17.999
Can you get Lexi's luggage?

24:18.041 --> 24:19.626
-Yes.
-Thank you.

24:19.668 --> 24:21.795
So, I just let her go.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.129
She was very graceful about it.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.130
Mm-hmm.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.423
You might wanna go talk to her.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.092
Yeah.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.927
Ow, [bleep].

24:28.968 --> 24:32.097
Considering Delaney is
still here, it's an option.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.266
She's not a stew, but at
least you have another person.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.935
It's up to you.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.186
-I'll think about it.
-Thanks.

24:38.228 --> 24:39.396
Can you get her luggage?
You need help?

24:39.437 --> 24:41.272
-Yeah, I can get it, yeah.
-Okay.

24:43.191 --> 24:44.984
-Ooah!
-There.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.152
Are you good?

24:46.194 --> 24:47.362
I mean, it is what it is,
like...

24:47.404 --> 24:49.989
-Yeah.
-Yeah, anyways, excuse me.

24:50.031 --> 24:53.368
Um... okay.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.413
She doesn't really wanna talk.

24:56.454 --> 24:57.789
So I'll talk to her later.

24:57.831 --> 24:58.998
Oh, she doesn't?
Where is she?

25:00.250 --> 25:01.251
She did?

25:03.003 --> 25:04.671
And then there were two.

25:04.713 --> 25:06.673
Who has demons from yesterday?

25:06.715 --> 25:08.008
This guy!

25:08.049 --> 25:09.968
Oh, the roses!

25:10.010 --> 25:11.219
[laughing]

25:11.261 --> 25:13.847
-Oh, was that planned?
-The rose plan.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.265
I wasn't planning...

25:15.306 --> 25:16.975
I hadn't plan to be
so smashed, though.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.310
I'm not embarrassed
at all about the flowers.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.312
It's more frustrating
than anything else

25:21.354 --> 25:24.065
that I was so, so trashed.

25:24.107 --> 25:25.942
To be fair,
it was taken with grace.

25:25.984 --> 25:27.777
Yeah.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.821
I will have a conversation
at some stage,

25:29.863 --> 25:31.489
just to respect
the other person's space.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.158
The flowers.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.451
[laughing]

25:35.452 --> 25:37.162
She has to be let go.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.039
I think it's the best
decision for the boat.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.875
Now I need to make a
decision about interior.

25:41.916 --> 25:44.419
She said, "You have the option
of having Delaney back."

25:44.461 --> 25:45.795
I was like [bleep] sh--.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.175
I know.

25:50.216 --> 25:53.803
We've got a lot to do, and
I've got no about how to do it.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.430
You all right?

25:55.472 --> 25:57.182
-Yeah.
-I'm just over it.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.142
Like, I mean, Katie tried
to say bye, but I was like,

25:59.184 --> 26:00.935
"Don't say 'bye' to me,"
so, goodbye.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.855
I want you to know, Lex, I think
you both were in the wrong,

26:03.897 --> 26:05.357
and I know that you're
the only one leaving,

26:05.398 --> 26:07.025
and that probably
seems unfair, but...

26:07.067 --> 26:09.736
If you do mind,
I wanna, like, be alone.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.404
Well, when you are ready,
we can say goodbye.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.239
Yeah, definitely.

26:18.536 --> 26:22.207
What the [bleep]...

26:22.248 --> 26:24.125
Deck crew needs to
clean their cabin, huh?

26:41.017 --> 26:43.103
<i>Mathew, Mathew,</i>
<i>meet me in the galley.</i>

26:45.397 --> 26:48.900
Okay, so, I let Lexi go,

26:48.942 --> 26:53.154
but your behavior
is also not, you know...

26:53.196 --> 26:56.866
Obviously, you had a thing

26:56.908 --> 26:59.202
that just couldn't
reset with her.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.037
-I just need you to own it.
-Yes.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.247
-Okay.
-Yeah.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.332
And then also,
you are replaceable.

27:04.374 --> 27:06.042
I know, I know.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.085
There's someone sitting in
quarantine right now

27:07.127 --> 27:09.254
to take your job.

27:09.295 --> 27:13.925
So, just don't ever,
ever do an ultimatum.

27:13.967 --> 27:15.093
That really disturbed me,

27:15.135 --> 27:16.886
especially since
our rocky start.

27:16.928 --> 27:20.390
You are like a head chef.
You have to rise above that.

27:20.432 --> 27:21.933
Yeah.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.518
So, I really need you
to act that part.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.395
I will.

27:25.437 --> 27:28.398
I want Mathew to stay because
the chef I have in quarantine

27:28.440 --> 27:31.401
doesn't have
the CV that Mathew has.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.820
Not one person has
complained about his food.

27:33.862 --> 27:38.616
I'm not gonna risk screwing that
part up because of his comment.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.326
Sometimes it's better to go
with the devil you know

27:40.368 --> 27:41.619
than the devil you don't know.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.080
-I'm sorry for my part.
-I know you are.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.887
-Where's Lexi?
-Packing.

28:00.972 --> 28:02.182
Yep.

28:04.059 --> 28:05.560
Captain Sandy did.

28:07.270 --> 28:09.439
I think Lexi being
fired is a big relief.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.274
I mean,
it's a ticking time bomb.

28:11.316 --> 28:12.525
It was meant to happen.

28:16.196 --> 28:17.322
I don't know about that yet.

28:17.364 --> 28:19.532
Ah [bleep] me.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.994
Hey, Lex?

28:23.036 --> 28:25.413
Hey, can I just come in
and get changed?

28:25.455 --> 28:28.958
I've got my... okay.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.012
Lex, need a hand?

28:42.472 --> 28:45.016
Why would I say bye to the crew

28:45.058 --> 28:47.310
that was being
extremely fake and evil?

28:47.352 --> 28:49.062
Why do I have to
be nice to you

28:49.104 --> 28:51.439
when you weren't being nice
to me at all?

28:51.481 --> 28:54.234
They don't exist in the room,
they're not acknowledged.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.944
Are you gonna say bye?

28:55.985 --> 28:58.196
She didn't want...
she just wanted to go.

28:58.238 --> 28:59.656
Come on, lemme help you.

28:59.698 --> 29:00.573
That one's heavy, I'll take
that sh--.

29:03.952 --> 29:07.455
Then there was two stews
left in the boat.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.376
All right,
I'll help you off with these.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.211
Thank you.

29:13.253 --> 29:15.380
I hate that I said things
I said.

29:15.422 --> 29:17.590
This thing's heavy.

29:17.632 --> 29:20.468
But I really hate
that I got to his level.

29:20.510 --> 29:22.679
And I feel like,
in a way, he won.

29:22.721 --> 29:24.264
-Thanks, Malia...
-Yeah.

29:24.305 --> 29:26.057
For all your help.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.143
I'm now wallowing in the mud
with you, so you won.

29:29.561 --> 29:31.021
Good luck.

29:31.062 --> 29:32.647
Thank you.
Have a good charter season.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.399
-Bye.
-Bye.

29:38.236 --> 29:39.237
Coming up...

29:39.279 --> 29:40.447
But you should have come to me.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.531
I'm not a chief officer.

29:41.573 --> 29:43.199
I don't give a [bleep]!

29:43.241 --> 29:45.243
You should have come
to me that he was hurt!

29:45.285 --> 29:47.370
-I didn't know it was that...
-Stop making excuses, Malia!

29:47.412 --> 29:48.413
-Captain Sandy, I didn't know...
-No!

29:58.465 --> 29:59.507
Oh, good...
so, everybody, have a seat.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.138
Obviously, Lexi's been let go,

30:05.180 --> 30:07.307
and we have two charters left.

30:07.349 --> 30:10.643
I'm hoping we can bring
back a third stew

30:10.685 --> 30:12.437
and finish our charter season.

30:12.479 --> 30:14.147
Unfortunately, I wanted
to finish with the same crew

30:14.189 --> 30:16.399
I started with,
but that didn't happen.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.277
No name-calling.
That's, like, for children.

30:19.319 --> 30:21.321
We're all adults here.

30:21.363 --> 30:23.573
And no threatening.

30:23.615 --> 30:27.452
My ultimate goal as a captain
is to provide for the client.

30:27.494 --> 30:29.496
I don't wanna see them suffer.

30:29.537 --> 30:32.374
This is a big challenge, and
we're gonna move through this.

30:32.415 --> 30:34.834
It's done. You don't ever
have to think about it again.

30:34.876 --> 30:38.171
Now we move on, and don't worry,

30:38.213 --> 30:39.547
because I think
you're amazing.

30:39.589 --> 30:41.466
So let's get ready
and do our best.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.843
Okay.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.345
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

30:45.387 --> 30:46.388
Thank you, Sandy.

30:50.225 --> 30:52.060
I think I've got a technique
going quicker downstairs,

30:52.102 --> 30:53.228
but not just up them yet.

30:55.230 --> 30:56.523
[text chime]

30:56.564 --> 30:58.316
Check this message I got
from Delaney saying,

30:58.358 --> 31:00.485
"It was epic to meet you,

31:00.527 --> 31:01.820
and I wish you an
amazing rest of season."

31:01.861 --> 31:03.446
Hope she comes back.

31:03.488 --> 31:04.656
Ha!

31:04.698 --> 31:06.533
What, what does she...

31:06.574 --> 31:08.159
No, I think it's to everyone.

31:08.201 --> 31:09.661
She just messaged,
"It was epic to meet you."

31:09.703 --> 31:11.371
It wasn't copy and pasty,
was it?

31:11.413 --> 31:12.622
You guys got the same message?

31:12.664 --> 31:14.541
Oh, now I don't feel special!

31:14.582 --> 31:16.376
Sh--.

31:16.418 --> 31:19.754
Yeah, this one says,
"It was epic to meet you."

31:19.796 --> 31:21.423
She copy-and-pasted you guys.

31:21.464 --> 31:23.299
-Wow.
-What the [bleep]?

31:23.341 --> 31:25.135
-It meant a lot to her.
-Now, that is moral fiber.

31:28.722 --> 31:29.764
Looking good.

31:33.393 --> 31:35.395
-How's your leg?
-Feeling sore.

31:35.437 --> 31:37.731
-I'm worried about you.
-Yeah.

31:37.772 --> 31:39.482
Let's put our
favorite awning up.

31:47.615 --> 31:48.783
Here, you grab that.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.871
-Got it.
-Nice!

31:52.912 --> 31:54.539
Yeah.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.124
All right, enjoy your
evening, thanks for today.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.917
I don't know what's happening,

31:57.959 --> 32:00.295
if we're getting a new person
or if Delaney's coming back,

32:00.337 --> 32:03.882
but either way, Dave, you
can move back in with Mathew.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.300
Cool.

32:08.261 --> 32:09.387
Should we do it in shifts?

32:09.429 --> 32:10.680
Yeah.

32:10.722 --> 32:13.808
It's like a messy break-up.

32:13.850 --> 32:15.435
There's sh-- everywhere.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.521
Nothing personal, but Dave
moving out feels great.

32:18.563 --> 32:20.190
Jesus Christ!

32:20.231 --> 32:21.858
What the [bleep]
happened in here?

32:21.900 --> 32:23.485
You've got three guys
in one room.

32:23.526 --> 32:25.612
It's not necessarily
the best fresh air.

32:25.653 --> 32:26.821
This is about a
thousand times better...

32:26.863 --> 32:27.906
-God!
-than it was this morning.

32:27.947 --> 32:31.409
-Oh magunga.
-Oh magunga!

32:31.451 --> 32:32.869
Mathew, Katie, Malia,
meet me in the crew mess

32:32.911 --> 32:34.829
for charter number six
preference sheet meeting.

32:40.418 --> 32:41.795
Charter number six.

32:41.836 --> 32:43.463
We're three-quarters
of the way through.

32:43.505 --> 32:45.632
Anthony Evans and Chris Loar.

32:45.674 --> 32:48.677
-Anthony is a gospel artist...
-Wow!

32:48.718 --> 32:50.637
Vocal producer, and author
who loves any trip

32:50.679 --> 32:52.222
that involves water.

32:52.263 --> 32:54.808
He met Chris,
an entrepreneur, at church.

32:54.849 --> 32:56.726
I love that he's a
gospel singer.

32:56.768 --> 32:59.604
I always wanna go to church
like that, that's, like, so...

32:59.646 --> 33:01.398
-The music?
-Yeah!

33:01.439 --> 33:03.233
I know, it's the only
reason I used to go to church,

33:03.274 --> 33:04.651
-was the music.
-Yeah.

33:04.693 --> 33:06.945
Myca is Chris' wife,
an interior designer.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.280
Ben was in Chris
and Myca's wedding,

33:09.322 --> 33:10.657
and is a firefighter
in Los Angeles.

33:10.699 --> 33:13.326
Also joining are Reyn,
a finance consultant,

33:13.368 --> 33:15.578
and Andre, an ex-pro basketball
player turned coach.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.330
Ooh!

33:17.372 --> 33:19.666
These guests are looking forward
to a mixture of adventure

33:19.708 --> 33:21.835
and time to stop and
smell the roses.

33:21.876 --> 33:23.670
See the primary doesn't drink.

33:23.712 --> 33:25.797
-That's a nice treat.
-Mm-hmm.

33:25.839 --> 33:27.632
So, itinerary requests.

33:27.674 --> 33:30.677
This active group plans
to use all the water toys.

33:30.719 --> 33:32.512
During their trip,

33:32.554 --> 33:34.264
they'd love to get off
the boat for a scenic picnic.

33:34.305 --> 33:36.599
I feel like this is gonna
be heavy on you guys this trip.

33:36.641 --> 33:38.351
Yeah.

33:38.393 --> 33:42.897
Holly has a cumin allergy
and Reyn is lactose intolerant.

33:42.939 --> 33:44.691
They would like
an Italian feast,

33:44.733 --> 33:46.526
with the table fully
decorated with roses.

33:46.568 --> 33:47.610
Mm, nice.

33:47.652 --> 33:49.362
I'm getting really nice vibes.

33:49.404 --> 33:50.739
All right, awesome.

34:01.958 --> 34:04.419
And when we got to that meal
at the waterfall, it was,

34:04.461 --> 34:06.629
like, I've just literally
been saucing

34:06.671 --> 34:08.298
since the minute I woke up.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.258
Well, I pretty much forgot
about the hotel meal.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.010
I thought that
whole night was...

34:12.052 --> 34:13.511
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Completely.

34:13.553 --> 34:15.388
-The speech?
-Yeah.

34:15.430 --> 34:16.639
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.725
I'd forgotten that
Lexi was gassing

34:18.767 --> 34:21.436
while you were doing
that speech.

34:21.478 --> 34:22.812
From the first night,

34:22.854 --> 34:25.398
when our chef got a
little sore knee, yeah?

34:31.946 --> 34:33.073
I just...

34:33.114 --> 34:35.617
I try not to say stuff,
but, like,

34:35.658 --> 34:36.868
last night I told her
to shut up.

34:36.910 --> 34:40.663
Lexi, sit back
and shut up, yeah?

34:40.705 --> 34:41.998
All right.

34:47.003 --> 34:49.589
'Sup?
How you feeling?

34:49.631 --> 34:50.632
Good.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.719
Either way,
it's gonna be ----ed.

34:57.013 --> 34:59.349
It obviously can
be quite intense.

34:59.391 --> 35:01.935
Like, I mean the hours that
you work can get quite long.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.687
How are you guys gonna do it
with two people?

35:03.728 --> 35:05.480
Isn't that gonna be crazy?

35:05.522 --> 35:08.900
Yeah, but I don't know
if she really helps.

35:13.988 --> 35:15.448
It is all good.

35:15.490 --> 35:17.492
Cheers, guys,
and have a good week.

35:18.827 --> 35:20.787
Even if you just, like,
stick her in laundry?

35:20.829 --> 35:22.664
I don't know.

35:22.706 --> 35:24.457
It's like it can help, but it
can also make it more work.

35:24.499 --> 35:25.917
These people seem nice,

35:25.959 --> 35:26.918
but they're gonna be
a lot, you know?

35:26.960 --> 35:28.586
Hectic.

35:28.628 --> 35:31.423
If we're running down
a person on interior,

35:31.464 --> 35:33.466
then of course we're
always happy to help out,

35:33.508 --> 35:36.636
but only after everything
on deck is taken care of.

35:36.678 --> 35:39.014
Because I'm not gonna look
like sh-- because a guest

35:39.055 --> 35:40.807
is gonna come out
and the sun deck hasn't been

35:40.849 --> 35:41.975
reset because the
deck crewmember's

35:42.017 --> 35:44.102
too busy doing laundry.
[bleep] no.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.937
That's not gonna happen.

35:45.979 --> 35:47.439
[sighs]

35:50.191 --> 35:51.526
It's so weird,
having all this space again.

35:51.568 --> 35:52.777
Yeah.

35:52.819 --> 35:53.862
-It's so nice.
-It's lush.

35:53.903 --> 35:55.697
I can't...

35:55.739 --> 35:57.407
honestly, I'm stoked to be
back in my ----ing bed, eh?

35:57.449 --> 35:58.575
Yeah.

35:58.616 --> 35:59.784
So sore, climbing up the bunks.

36:03.538 --> 36:07.667
I would so much rather, like,
work harder and work longer.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.961
And, like, I already don't
really take breaks anyway,

36:10.003 --> 36:12.672
so nothing really changes
for me in that department.

36:12.714 --> 36:15.842
Than have the emotional stress
of bringing somebody new in,

36:15.884 --> 36:17.469
or bringing Delaney back.

36:17.510 --> 36:20.513
I just feel like this
is what we're gonna do.

36:28.063 --> 36:29.814
[alarm rings]

36:29.856 --> 36:31.024
[yawns]

36:37.655 --> 36:39.699
[yawns]

36:39.741 --> 36:41.034
Cute!

36:41.076 --> 36:43.536
Oh, my God, I want you
to braid my hair!

36:43.578 --> 36:45.872
-You wanna start in laundry?
-Yeah.

36:45.914 --> 36:48.416
Something smells delicious,
what's he cooking?

36:59.761 --> 37:01.096
Hello.

37:01.137 --> 37:02.639
Do you wanna
do Captain Sandy's cabin,

37:02.681 --> 37:04.724
-and I'll do bridge?
-Yeah, sure.

37:04.766 --> 37:10.105
Also, I've made up my mind
about these next two trips.

37:10.146 --> 37:11.773
Mm-hmm.

37:11.815 --> 37:14.109
I think it's best
it's just me and you.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.489
I think we'll be fine.

37:19.531 --> 37:20.865
We got this, sister.

37:20.907 --> 37:22.075
Sh--.

37:22.117 --> 37:23.118
Three nights.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.661
Woo!

37:24.703 --> 37:26.079
Are we gonna...

37:26.121 --> 37:27.455
Oh, I can't float that,
bloody dangerous, that.

37:27.497 --> 37:29.124
[laughing]

37:32.836 --> 37:34.587
-Knock, knock.
-Come on in.

37:42.012 --> 37:44.222
I cannot believe we only
have two charters left.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.807
<i>Captain Sandy, Katie.</i>

37:45.849 --> 37:47.058
<i>Can you please meet me</i>
<i>in the main salon?</i>

37:47.100 --> 37:48.768
Copy.

37:48.810 --> 37:50.603
It's always this charter,
it's the hardest.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.147
-What, second to last?
-Yeah.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.815
They'll love us.

37:53.857 --> 37:57.110
I gotta tell you, like,
I was, like, not sleeping well,

37:57.152 --> 37:59.571
thinking about this
next two charters.

37:59.612 --> 38:00.947
Yeah.

38:00.989 --> 38:02.282
I'm not gonna pressure you
to do anything.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.117
I do not want the client
to feel the impact.

38:04.159 --> 38:05.535
-Yeah.
-That's all I...

38:05.577 --> 38:07.162
-I mean, and...
-That's my reason.

38:07.203 --> 38:09.497
Even though it makes sense to
have an extra hand on board,

38:09.539 --> 38:12.292
that last trip was actually
more work, and I had four stews.

38:12.334 --> 38:13.710
I just have to really
trust my gut with this one.

38:13.752 --> 38:15.587
Okay.

38:15.628 --> 38:17.797
Because last time I didn't,
and I have thought about it,

38:17.839 --> 38:20.884
and I think this is the best
decision for the client as well.

38:20.925 --> 38:23.136
Because everyone
will feel lighter, happier,

38:23.178 --> 38:24.637
including myself.

38:24.679 --> 38:26.598
Well, you've made a decision.

38:26.639 --> 38:27.599
-I have.
-I trust you.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.142
-Okay.
-Okay.

38:29.184 --> 38:31.061
-Thank you, Captain Sandy.
-You're welcome, thanks.

38:31.102 --> 38:34.272
I think it may be harder
on her, but I do trust her.

38:34.314 --> 38:36.524
So, I need to allow
Katie to have this journey,

38:36.566 --> 38:37.692
and support her.

38:40.278 --> 38:41.988
Coming up...

38:42.030 --> 38:44.574
I don't give a [bleep].
He hits his head, anything...

38:55.210 --> 38:55.627
Ah, provisions.

38:57.754 --> 38:59.214
All crew, all crew,
looks like provisions

38:59.255 --> 39:00.632
have started to arrive.

39:00.674 --> 39:01.675
Ow!

39:04.803 --> 39:05.845
Ooh!

39:07.097 --> 39:08.306
Oh.

39:11.101 --> 39:13.061
We haven't gotten flowers yet.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.604
I get flowers all the time.

39:14.646 --> 39:15.772
[laughing]

39:16.940 --> 39:19.401
-Can we keep them?
-Yeah, Courtney!

39:19.442 --> 39:20.735
Thank you!

39:20.777 --> 39:22.112
Is this for Courtney or Coco?

39:24.072 --> 39:26.241
Oh! Mzi, you are so sweet.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.076
Nice for you to put
them in water, finally.

39:28.118 --> 39:29.744
I did, I put them in...

39:29.786 --> 39:31.246
yeah, it's because we
were drunk and tired.

39:31.287 --> 39:33.915
So the next day, they
were straight in water.

39:33.957 --> 39:37.293
I mean, they are in a glass, not
a vase, but it's a nice glass.

39:40.255 --> 39:41.965
Yeah.

39:43.842 --> 39:44.926
Whew.

39:54.686 --> 39:56.354
I'll go do a working permit,

39:56.396 --> 39:57.856
so we can put someone
over the side.

39:57.897 --> 39:59.232
Who wants to go?

39:59.274 --> 40:00.233
-I'll do the forward ones.
-Can you?

40:00.275 --> 40:01.776
Yeah.

40:01.818 --> 40:03.319
I don't know that
I can put you over,

40:03.361 --> 40:05.822
-knowing that you're injured.
-No.

40:05.864 --> 40:07.699
Only do it if you feel
like you can, with your leg.

40:07.741 --> 40:09.159
-Yeah, it'll be fine.
-Okay.

40:26.176 --> 40:27.969
Are you vibing right now?

40:28.011 --> 40:29.929
I don't know, because
I'm feeling tension again.

40:29.971 --> 40:31.222
Yeah, but different
tension, right?

40:31.264 --> 40:33.767
Yeah.

40:33.808 --> 40:35.143
Are you all right?

40:35.185 --> 40:36.186
Yeah.

40:39.105 --> 40:40.690
Hey, Malia,
what's your location?

40:40.732 --> 40:42.233
Bridge deck aft.

40:42.275 --> 40:45.028
Can you come to the starboard
side of the main deck?

40:45.070 --> 40:46.988
Copy, on my way.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.867
Tell me why you're limping.

40:50.909 --> 40:53.161
I fell.

40:53.203 --> 40:55.163
-And?
-Injured myself.

40:55.205 --> 40:56.331
Lemme see your injury.

40:57.874 --> 41:00.210
-That's a major injury.
-Bruised it.

41:00.251 --> 41:01.753
How did you do that?

41:01.795 --> 41:03.088
Fell off the side of the
hot tub the other night.

41:05.048 --> 41:08.051
Why wasn't it reported to me?

41:08.093 --> 41:12.722
You, I'm really disappointed
in, one thousand percent.

41:12.764 --> 41:14.933
It's a ----ing incident,

41:14.974 --> 41:17.018
and you will not be
getting in that harness,

41:17.060 --> 41:18.728
going on the side of the boat.

41:18.770 --> 41:20.146
Go make the report now.

41:20.188 --> 41:21.981
I'm really disappointed, Malia.

41:22.023 --> 41:25.527
This is something you do not
keep from the captain, at all.

41:29.406 --> 41:30.782
Understood.

41:30.824 --> 41:33.284
-It was... okay.
-It was what?

41:33.326 --> 41:37.372
He fell, he injured himself,
and I had no idea.

41:37.414 --> 41:39.207
Why didn't you report to me
that he's injured?

41:39.249 --> 41:40.959
Because it was a bruise.

41:41.001 --> 41:43.378
You know what, you can
minimize this all you want...

41:43.420 --> 41:46.214
I asked him if he needed to see
a doctor, he said no, he...

41:46.256 --> 41:48.174
I don't want him in the harness.
Find someone else.

41:56.266 --> 42:00.061
Learning about David's
injury really pisses me off.

42:00.103 --> 42:02.105
Not reporting this is
a safety issue.

42:02.147 --> 42:04.441
What happens is the crewmember
becomes a liability

42:04.482 --> 42:06.192
to the vessel
and to the owner.

42:06.234 --> 42:09.279
They have to be physically fit
to be able

42:09.320 --> 42:11.448
to perform their duties,
especially on deck.

42:11.489 --> 42:14.534
The fact that Malia knew about
his injury is not okay with me.

42:14.576 --> 42:16.119
She broke my trust.

42:22.876 --> 42:23.877
Whoa!

42:27.130 --> 42:28.423
Oh, there's a lot of laund.

42:28.465 --> 42:30.175
What's going on?

42:30.216 --> 42:32.552
We're so under-crewed,
but it's great.

42:32.594 --> 42:34.387
If I'm making an
incident report for David,

42:34.429 --> 42:36.139
can I see the ones for--

42:36.181 --> 42:37.932
-No, it's in the medical log.
-Okay.

42:37.974 --> 42:40.477
But you should have come
to me when he got hurt.

42:40.518 --> 42:41.853
I understand that.

42:41.895 --> 42:43.313
I did my part of it,

42:43.355 --> 42:45.315
where I asked him do
you need to see a doctor.

42:45.357 --> 42:46.483
-No, no, no, Malia...
-Is it serious.

42:46.524 --> 42:47.484
No, no.

42:47.525 --> 42:48.943
I'm not a chief officer.

42:48.985 --> 42:50.320
I don't give a [bleep]!

42:50.362 --> 42:52.238
You should have come
to me that he was hurt!

42:52.280 --> 42:54.407
-I didn't know it was that...
-Stop making excuses, Malia.

42:54.449 --> 42:55.617
-Captain Sandy, I didn't know...
-No!

42:55.658 --> 42:56.618
...it was that bad
of an injury.

42:56.659 --> 42:58.536
Well, it's pretty bad.

42:58.578 --> 42:59.537
I don't wanna take the risk,
Malia.

42:59.579 --> 43:01.331
Fine!

43:01.373 --> 43:03.249
You call me when someone's hurt.
I made it very clear.

43:03.291 --> 43:06.461
Injuries... if any guests or you
guys are injured in any way,

43:06.503 --> 43:08.129
I wanna be the first
to know about it.

43:08.171 --> 43:10.382
So, stop trying to make excuses.
Get back to your job.

43:11.883 --> 43:13.176
[bleep]

43:16.638 --> 43:18.139
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:18.181 --> 43:19.224
-Hey, hey.
-Hi!

43:19.265 --> 43:20.475
I'm Anthony.

43:20.517 --> 43:21.893
You're gonna have
pure perfection.

43:23.603 --> 43:25.063
-Mzi!
-Oh no!

43:25.105 --> 43:26.898
-Are you okay?
-I'm freaking out.

43:26.940 --> 43:29.317
Can you say a little prayer that
they love everything tonight?

43:29.359 --> 43:30.568
I'm not a ----ing mother.

43:30.610 --> 43:32.320
I will hate you in a minute.

43:32.362 --> 43:33.988
Ah!

43:34.030 --> 43:35.657
I think those two skis might
have gone into town.

43:35.699 --> 43:36.866
They went under that bridge?

43:36.908 --> 43:37.867
Go get them.

43:37.909 --> 43:39.035
Guys!

43:39.077 --> 43:40.286
----ing idiot!

43:40.328 --> 43:42.122
Ready?
Candid laughter.

43:42.163 --> 43:43.415
Ha ha!

43:43.456 --> 43:46.001
We got married, bitches!

43:46.042 --> 43:47.002
-You've done it all.
-Yeah.

43:47.043 --> 43:48.461
Do you want another drink?

43:48.503 --> 43:50.088
No rush, I'm just...
I'm hanging.

43:50.130 --> 43:51.464
Harmless flirting, you know?
I'll take it.

43:51.506 --> 43:54.426
You got rigatoni bolognaise
with parmesan.

43:54.467 --> 43:56.511
The client pulled out
her own paddleboard.

43:56.553 --> 43:58.179
Who's your early morning guy?

43:58.221 --> 44:00.348
-Mzi.
-What the [bleep]?

44:00.390 --> 44:02.434
Please take the
anchor ball down.

44:02.475 --> 44:04.185
-Ugh!
-Don't look like pros.

44:04.227 --> 44:07.355
Deck crew,
really pissing me off.

44:07.397 --> 44:10.108
-We're a two-man team.
-Like, I can't take it.

44:10.150 --> 44:12.569
Captain Sandy, you're very
close to the dolphin.

44:12.610 --> 44:14.070
[bleep]
