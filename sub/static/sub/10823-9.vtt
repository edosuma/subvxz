WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:04.454
Previously on Ravenswood.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.508
The cops need to know about this, mom.

00:06.510 --> 00:08.042
Because they've been so helpful to us.

00:08.044 --> 00:09.177
They found a knife in our yard.

00:09.179 --> 00:10.845
Like this.

00:10.847 --> 00:13.715
I saw you holding the knife
you used to kill Luke's dad.

00:13.717 --> 00:15.649
I'm the deal maker not the murderer.

00:15.651 --> 00:16.751
Promises were made.

00:16.753 --> 00:18.219
This townhouse is packed.

00:19.421 --> 00:20.822
Let's go.

00:20.824 --> 00:22.389
You should not have seen,

00:22.391 --> 00:24.726
You're going to wish you
were dead before this is over.

00:24.728 --> 00:26.194
What were you doing with Mr. Collins?

00:26.196 --> 00:27.828
Who do you think helped me
find a lawyer so quickly?

00:27.830 --> 00:28.995
I don't want you by yourself

00:28.997 --> 00:30.731
if that freak Collins
is coming to your house.

00:30.733 --> 00:32.198
I told my brother I would be safe with you.

00:32.201 --> 00:33.166
You are safe with me.

00:34.936 --> 00:37.338
I'm not the one you have
to worry about pleasing.

00:37.340 --> 00:39.139
Before your dad was mayor,

00:39.141 --> 00:40.374
he was a city attorney.

00:40.376 --> 00:42.776
Spinger's dad is in jail because of him.

00:42.778 --> 00:44.845
Springer!

00:44.847 --> 00:46.747
Why did you put that knife in my yard?

00:46.749 --> 00:48.581
He made me do it. Dillon.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.124
Shall we test it?

00:57.126 --> 00:59.392
You brought a can of spray paint.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.831
Who replaced it?

01:05.833 --> 01:07.867
Mr. Collins. He said it was a gift.

01:07.869 --> 01:11.170
And evidently, it's got
some kind of coating on it

01:11.172 --> 01:13.072
that resists vandalism.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.076
I bet your dad would've
loved to have some of that

01:17.078 --> 01:19.311
sprayed on him when he
was running for mayor.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.413
What did Collins do with the old one?

01:21.415 --> 01:22.381
Dad's headstone?

01:22.383 --> 01:25.217
Who knows.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.119
I hope he made a sled out of it.

01:28.454 --> 01:30.022
Next winter, we could honor your dad

01:30.024 --> 01:32.124
and drag it up to the
top of Pinecrest Hill.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.092
We'll all pile on and push off.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.962
He would've loved that.

01:37.964 --> 01:39.298
You know, when we were still dating,

01:39.300 --> 01:41.099
he took me up there after a blizzard.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.703
Insisted that we take
that hill stark naked.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.937
Are you serious?

01:45.939 --> 01:49.340
He never mentioned that
on the campaign trail.

01:49.342 --> 01:53.744
Or the frostbite he had
in very delicate areas..

02:18.670 --> 02:20.371
Mrs. Matheson?

02:20.373 --> 02:22.105
Who're you?

02:22.107 --> 02:24.208
I'm Detective Scarpelli.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.375
I've been assigned to your husband's case.

02:25.377 --> 02:27.711
Why're you here? What is this about?

02:27.713 --> 02:29.213
I'm here to place you under arrest, ma'am.

02:29.215 --> 02:30.480
What?

02:30.482 --> 02:31.815
You can't do this here!

02:31.817 --> 02:34.384
Guys don't. We knew this could happen.

02:34.386 --> 02:37.120
Call Karen Lescher, then Uncle Rob.

02:37.122 --> 02:38.888
- Mom...
- It's going to be fine.

02:38.890 --> 02:39.922
Luke, take your sister home.

02:39.924 --> 02:41.725
We're coming with you, all right?

<font color="#40bfff">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:04.281 --> 03:06.415
I told them who they should
be talking to is Springer.

03:06.417 --> 03:08.417
Why is no one going to the hospital

03:08.419 --> 03:10.052
and asking about what's on his phone?

03:10.054 --> 03:11.487
Are you sure you want them to hear that?

03:11.489 --> 03:13.321
I don't know what's going on with Dillon,

03:13.323 --> 03:14.690
but he has no reason to hurt us.

03:14.692 --> 03:16.224
So then why isn't he here?

03:16.226 --> 03:17.760
- How come he's not texting you back?
- I don't know.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.094
I don't know where he is,

03:19.096 --> 03:20.929
his mom won't even give
me a straight answer.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.534
"You're going to wish you were dead."

03:27.236 --> 03:29.771
What... ? What did you say?

03:29.773 --> 03:31.339
I didn't say it. The drunk said it to me.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.840
Remy heard that in her dream.

03:32.842 --> 03:34.009
It was on her drawing.

03:34.011 --> 03:35.010
What're you talking about?

03:35.012 --> 03:36.278
She heard even more at the clinic.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.613
That preacher said, it's not "random."

03:38.615 --> 03:39.614
"Debts are owed."

03:41.050 --> 03:43.018
Think about it.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.685
We were supposed to die, but we didn't,

03:44.687 --> 03:45.986
and now the people we care about

03:45.988 --> 03:47.321
are disappearing one by one.

03:49.391 --> 03:52.226
Look. What's he doing here?

03:52.228 --> 03:53.394
We've been standing
out here the whole time,

03:53.396 --> 03:54.829
- did you see him go in?
- No.

03:55.898 --> 03:57.031
Hello.

03:59.902 --> 04:01.302
What are you doing here?

04:01.304 --> 04:02.636
How did you know about this?

04:02.638 --> 04:05.406
Her attorney called me.

04:05.408 --> 04:07.341
Can I drop you off at home?

04:07.343 --> 04:08.775
We're not going anywhere.

04:08.777 --> 04:10.377
Well, neither is she.

04:10.379 --> 04:11.745
Why?

04:11.747 --> 04:13.948
She hasn't done anything!

04:13.950 --> 04:15.782
Our mother did not kill our father!

04:15.784 --> 04:16.951
That'll be proven.

04:18.351 --> 04:20.320
Mr. Collins?

04:20.322 --> 04:21.922
May I speak with you?

04:28.195 --> 04:29.729
Why is he here?

04:29.731 --> 04:31.230
Remy should've asked that preacher

04:31.232 --> 04:34.667
if Collins is the one that
put Springer up to this!

04:34.669 --> 04:37.870
So that he could swoop
in and be her savior?

04:37.872 --> 04:39.105
I don't know.

04:39.107 --> 04:40.228
You can see your mother now.

04:54.821 --> 04:56.221
What're you doing here?

04:56.223 --> 04:57.523
It's your first day.

04:57.525 --> 04:59.959
Thought you might like
to see a friendly face.

04:59.961 --> 05:03.095
Thank you, but I think I've got it covered.

05:03.097 --> 05:05.865
And there's not a evil
preacher teaching Spanish lab.

05:05.867 --> 05:07.665
Well, you never know.

05:07.667 --> 05:09.101
Actually, I do.

05:09.103 --> 05:11.003
Her name is SeÃ±ora Gomez.

05:11.005 --> 05:13.238
I'd like to make it through my first day

05:13.240 --> 05:15.107
without you trying to
clock her with a lamp.

05:15.109 --> 05:16.641
Fine.

05:16.643 --> 05:18.210
I'll sit quietly in your locker.

05:18.212 --> 05:19.211
Where is it?

05:19.213 --> 05:21.313
I have no idea.

05:21.315 --> 05:22.780
"720".

05:22.782 --> 05:25.116
Better hurry. You're already tardy.

05:25.118 --> 05:26.885
I've got a form for that, too.

05:26.887 --> 05:27.886
Here it is.

05:29.087 --> 05:32.891
So what's our first class?

05:32.893 --> 05:33.958
Well, I can audit.

05:35.895 --> 05:38.897
History. Mr. Price.

05:38.899 --> 05:41.198
I think Luke's in class. So is Remy.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.900
Yeah, I haven't seen them today.

05:42.902 --> 05:44.101
Or Olivia.

05:44.103 --> 05:46.703
What's wrong with this stupid lock?

05:46.705 --> 05:48.005
You're nervous.

05:48.007 --> 05:49.340
Maybe your hands are sweaty.

05:49.342 --> 05:51.175
Mine were. When I had them.

05:51.177 --> 05:52.243
No, this isn't nerves.

05:52.245 --> 05:53.911
They gave me the wrong combo!

05:53.913 --> 05:55.346
Easy.

05:55.348 --> 05:56.780
You mess with school property,
they'll call your dad.

05:56.782 --> 05:58.314
Fine with me.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.984
At least he'd know I was
enrolled and get off my case.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.119
Um, who were you talking to?

06:05.657 --> 06:08.458
Um,

06:08.460 --> 06:10.093
my locker.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.628
Did it answer?

06:11.630 --> 06:13.831
'Cause if it did, I could
call the school nurse for you.

06:15.299 --> 06:16.332
That's funny.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.567
No, it's not.

06:17.569 --> 06:18.868
Stay out of this.

06:18.870 --> 06:20.270
Let me guess,

06:20.272 --> 06:24.374
was your last school uniform
a hospital gown and booties?

06:31.247 --> 06:32.715
Nice.

06:33.984 --> 06:36.285
Now can you open mine next?

06:36.287 --> 06:37.687
What're you laughing at, freakazoid?

06:40.624 --> 06:42.091
The day has started, people.

06:43.827 --> 06:45.061
Are you looking for another book?

06:45.063 --> 06:48.964
Uh, no, actually I'm in your class.

06:48.966 --> 06:51.233
Then I suggest you find your seat.

06:59.743 --> 07:01.910
Who decides the bail?

07:01.912 --> 07:03.979
A judge.

07:03.981 --> 07:05.046
Luke... ?

07:05.048 --> 07:06.247
Yeah.

07:06.249 --> 07:07.448
Can you sit down?

07:07.450 --> 07:09.283
No, I'm not getting comfortable in here.

07:09.285 --> 07:10.285
And you shouldn't either.

07:12.822 --> 07:13.989
Can you please go out to the car

07:13.991 --> 07:15.023
and get me my coat?

07:15.025 --> 07:16.625
Yeah.

07:18.628 --> 07:20.861
Listen to me.

07:20.863 --> 07:22.696
You need to be your brother's keeper.

07:22.698 --> 07:24.098
What does that mean?

07:24.100 --> 07:26.300
He's already had trouble with the police...

07:26.302 --> 07:27.968
Mom, you're the one who's in trouble...

07:27.970 --> 07:29.604
I'm innocent.

07:29.606 --> 07:31.572
He's got a temper like your father

07:31.574 --> 07:33.841
and he's lost right now and he's angry

07:33.843 --> 07:35.409
and he could do something
that he'll regret...

07:35.411 --> 07:37.011
Mom...

07:37.013 --> 07:38.278
He's not convinced that I
didn't do this to your father.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.781
That's not true.

07:40.783 --> 07:42.149
He knows...

07:43.184 --> 07:44.551
He knows what?

07:46.054 --> 07:47.888
Nothing.

07:52.693 --> 07:54.794
Luke... ?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.834
I'm so sorry. This is my fault.

08:01.836 --> 08:03.970
You had nothing to do with this.

08:03.972 --> 08:06.173
You guys are being punished
because of what I saw.

08:06.175 --> 08:07.607
Because I challenged Abaddon.

08:07.609 --> 08:11.744
I'd rather know what
we're up against than not.

08:11.746 --> 08:15.882
Has Olivia heard from Dillon yet?

08:15.884 --> 08:17.416
Has anyone spoken to Springer?

08:17.418 --> 08:18.785
He's not talking.

08:18.787 --> 08:20.319
I mean, it's one thing
to share with my sister.

08:20.321 --> 08:22.889
He's not going to talk with
the police, there's no way.

08:22.891 --> 08:25.058
Luke, Springer wouldn't have
said anything about Dillon

08:25.060 --> 08:27.092
if he wasn't ready to say more.

08:27.094 --> 08:29.127
He just needs to know it
won't come back to haunt him.

08:29.129 --> 08:31.330
Who is going to promise him that?

08:31.332 --> 08:32.698
Remember where we live?

08:42.241 --> 08:43.640
Caleb?

08:45.211 --> 08:46.311
Caleb... ?

08:46.313 --> 08:48.980
What?

08:48.982 --> 08:50.782
I saw you were on that during class.

08:50.784 --> 08:52.450
We have a strict policy here.

08:52.452 --> 08:54.152
Students take out their
phones, we eat them.

08:54.154 --> 08:56.888
Sorry, I...

08:56.890 --> 08:59.324
a friend of mine, his mother's in jail...

08:59.326 --> 09:01.158
You mean Luke?

09:01.160 --> 09:03.428
They arrested her at the
cemetery this morning.

09:03.430 --> 09:05.196
While she was visiting his father's grave.

09:06.865 --> 09:08.766
That family's been through so much already.

09:10.302 --> 09:13.137
Yeah, I heard you were working there.

09:13.139 --> 09:14.872
In the cemetery.

09:14.874 --> 09:15.840
How did that happen?

09:15.842 --> 09:18.209
I needed a place to stay.

09:18.211 --> 09:20.144
Mr. Collins needed
someone to pull his weeds.

09:20.146 --> 09:21.879
Be careful.

09:21.881 --> 09:23.948
We just had some strange
dealings with Collins.

09:23.950 --> 09:25.783
I won't be in that cemetery forever.

09:25.785 --> 09:28.085
You'll be the first.

09:31.289 --> 09:34.023
What do you mean by "strange dealings"?

09:34.025 --> 09:36.025
There's a small chapel
near the west entrance...

09:36.027 --> 09:37.060
Yeah, I know it.

09:37.062 --> 09:38.729
I've never been inside of it.

09:38.731 --> 09:41.331
Nobody has. He's keeps it locked up tight.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.966
Last year, the Historical Society

09:42.968 --> 09:45.769
asked me to take pictures
of the stained glass.

09:45.771 --> 09:47.203
Collins chased me off the property.

09:47.205 --> 09:48.271
Threatened a lawsuit.

09:49.306 --> 09:50.774
He told me it was unsafe.

09:50.776 --> 09:51.808
In "disrepair."

09:51.810 --> 09:54.010
It's perfectly intact. Pristine.

09:54.012 --> 09:56.012
Then why are the doors chained shut?

09:56.014 --> 09:57.747
God knows why.

10:00.785 --> 10:02.485
When will you be here?

10:02.487 --> 10:04.053
I called the bank, Uncle Rob,

10:04.055 --> 10:06.015
there aren't enough zeroes
in any of the accounts.

10:07.157 --> 10:08.758
The bail is ridiculous...

10:09.960 --> 10:11.026
Luke's not here.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.595
Can I call you back?

10:22.772 --> 10:24.039
Hey.

10:31.070 --> 10:32.103
Can I come in?

10:34.173 --> 10:35.606
Please?

10:42.348 --> 10:43.948
I just heard about your mom.

10:45.384 --> 10:48.319
God, Livie,

10:48.321 --> 10:51.822
why are the cops in this
town working overtime to...

10:51.824 --> 10:53.157
Where have you been?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.126
You won't believe me.

10:56.128 --> 10:57.695
You're right.

10:57.697 --> 11:00.197
I probably won't.

11:00.199 --> 11:01.432
Where've you been, Dillon?

11:01.434 --> 11:05.369
My parents shipped me off, all right.

11:05.371 --> 11:07.304
72 hours of "purification."

11:07.306 --> 11:08.638
What?

11:08.640 --> 11:10.140
Ministry camp.

11:10.142 --> 11:12.809
My mom found...

11:12.811 --> 11:14.978
Oh, this is really embarrassing.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.746
Get past it.

11:16.748 --> 11:19.749
She found condoms in my drawer.

11:19.751 --> 11:21.118
She freaked out.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.188
My mom called the pastor,
my dad took my phone,

11:25.190 --> 11:26.890
and then they sent me off into the woods

11:26.892 --> 11:28.291
"to have the devil shaken out of me."

11:28.293 --> 11:29.960
Well, here is what you missed.

11:29.962 --> 11:31.294
The weapon that killed my dad

11:31.296 --> 11:32.862
was found buried in our backyard.

11:32.864 --> 11:34.731
What?

11:34.733 --> 11:35.899
Yeah.

11:35.901 --> 11:37.901
It gets better.

11:37.903 --> 11:40.837
Zack Springer told me that
you made him put it there.

11:42.306 --> 11:43.939
That's insane.

11:43.941 --> 11:46.709
Is it?

11:46.711 --> 11:49.145
There's a garbled message on his phone...

11:49.147 --> 11:50.413
sounds like he's talking to you.

11:50.415 --> 11:52.615
Then he made that message
to mess with you...

11:52.617 --> 11:53.816
Dillon...

11:53.818 --> 11:55.684
Why would you believe
anything Springer says?

11:57.154 --> 11:58.386
Who do you think tossed
that bucket of paint on you

11:58.388 --> 11:59.755
in the parade?

12:02.058 --> 12:03.692
You should've called me.

12:05.128 --> 12:06.294
You're right.

12:09.833 --> 12:10.933
I'm sorry.

12:10.935 --> 12:12.768
I should've found a way.

12:14.870 --> 12:16.838
I know you're angry.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.940
Okay, I don't blame you.

12:20.676 --> 12:24.746
But you know I'm telling
the truth about Springer.

12:24.748 --> 12:28.950
I missed you so much.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.154
Please forgive me.

12:35.090 --> 12:36.858
I'm here now.

12:56.978 --> 12:58.912
Hey, Luke,

12:58.914 --> 13:01.182
how's it going?

13:08.322 --> 13:12.625
I saw the woman whose son's
body was delivered last night.

13:12.627 --> 13:14.795
That man took the body from grave riders.

13:14.797 --> 13:17.330
I knew the woman, I knew
the little dog on that grave.

13:17.332 --> 13:20.667
He killed the dog.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.034
And that's why you won't be a doctor.

13:23.738 --> 13:25.705
Not if I have to be a
party to things like that.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.144
What're you doing here?

13:32.146 --> 13:33.179
How're you feeling?

13:33.181 --> 13:34.880
Better.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.349
Does that complete our interview?

13:36.351 --> 13:38.150
I wasn't sent here by The Gazette.

13:38.152 --> 13:40.112
I'm here because of Luke
and Olivia and their mom.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.658
This town has a history
of jumping to conclusions.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.728
Passing judgment and locking people up

13:48.730 --> 13:50.863
before they have all the answers.

13:50.865 --> 13:53.332
Isn't that what happened to your father?

13:53.334 --> 13:56.301
What if it did?

13:56.303 --> 13:57.402
What about it?

13:57.404 --> 14:00.004
Look, if what you told Olivia is true

14:00.006 --> 14:01.906
and you and Dillon had something
to do with that knife...

14:01.908 --> 14:03.242
Visiting hours are over.

14:03.244 --> 14:04.809
Springer, if you come forward

14:04.811 --> 14:05.944
and tell your story to the cops,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.379
the right person will get punished.

14:07.381 --> 14:09.981
Just like it worked for my father?

14:11.683 --> 14:13.151
You think I did because I wanted to?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.753
You think I want to do it now?

14:22.996 --> 14:24.662
Is this what Dillon did to you?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.030
Put you on mute?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.065
He comes back and suddenly
you've lost your voice?

14:28.067 --> 14:31.034
"Comes back" from where?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.737
What makes you think he ever left?

14:32.739 --> 14:33.871
What're you saying?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.773
He's been around this whole time?

14:35.775 --> 14:36.840
Did he come to see you?

14:38.877 --> 14:40.811
Wait.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.380
What if I was sent here by The Gazette?

14:42.382 --> 14:45.249
If there was a way I could help you,

14:45.251 --> 14:46.984
would you help me?

14:51.156 --> 14:52.489
You spoke with Luke?

14:52.491 --> 14:53.757
Yeah, briefly.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.725
He thinks this is all
connected to The Pact...

14:55.727 --> 14:57.027
Might be right.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.929
Just 'cause I scared
Abaddon out of Remy's life

14:58.931 --> 15:01.898
doesn't mean that Luke
and Olivia are off-limits.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.099
But...

15:03.101 --> 15:05.034
what if this is just
about a vindictive punk

15:05.036 --> 15:06.269
with an axe to grind?

15:06.271 --> 15:09.005
Well, that "punk" used
to work for your uncle.

15:09.007 --> 15:12.008
Who's pretty good with
a sharp blade himself.

15:12.010 --> 15:14.844
What if Springer threw Dillon
under the bus as a distraction?

15:14.846 --> 15:16.345
Distraction from what?

15:16.347 --> 15:17.613
Collins.

15:17.615 --> 15:19.182
Maybe he's still working for him.

15:19.184 --> 15:21.050
You know, we thought we
loosened your uncle's grip

15:21.052 --> 15:22.718
when we found his "secret room."

15:22.720 --> 15:23.719
But it looks like he's got another one,

15:23.721 --> 15:24.954
out by the west entrance.

15:24.956 --> 15:26.689
Caleb, I've been in that chapel.

15:26.691 --> 15:30.226
It's small, it's quiet,
it's a lot like my grave.

15:30.228 --> 15:31.760
With less dirt.

15:31.762 --> 15:34.330
Then why is he trying so
hard to keep everybody out?

15:34.332 --> 15:35.764
Maybe he's trying to keep something in.

15:35.766 --> 15:38.701
Can you please not drink
that in front of me?

15:38.703 --> 15:40.168
What do you care?

15:40.170 --> 15:41.169
It's not like you have to hydrate.

15:41.171 --> 15:43.071
I love papaya juice.

15:43.073 --> 15:45.641
You can still crave
something you can't have.

15:49.912 --> 15:52.380
So what made you go to the chapel?

15:52.382 --> 15:54.349
I have a lot of hours to fill in my day.

15:54.351 --> 15:56.384
It's not like I'm on
full time bully patrol.

15:56.386 --> 16:01.056
Yeah, about that. Never again, okay?

16:01.058 --> 16:02.657
I don't need a bodyguard.

16:02.659 --> 16:04.326
That was not for you.

16:04.328 --> 16:05.426
That was for me.

16:05.428 --> 16:06.728
You don't even know them.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.730
Oh, I know them. And so do you.

16:08.732 --> 16:10.865
They just come in different
hair colors and bra sizes.

16:13.369 --> 16:14.969
What did you mean by "trying
to keep something in"?

16:14.971 --> 16:16.771
I don't know. It's just something I said.

16:18.707 --> 16:20.007
All right.

16:20.009 --> 16:22.977
Listen, I know you're not
great with door handles,

16:22.979 --> 16:24.778
but can you blow out a window or something

16:24.780 --> 16:25.946
so I could climb in there?

16:25.948 --> 16:27.314
Not without my uncle knowing.

16:27.316 --> 16:29.816
I'm better at exploding than reassembling.

16:31.019 --> 16:32.353
But...

16:32.355 --> 16:34.855
I could keep an eye on him
while you look for that key.

16:35.957 --> 16:37.024
You read my mind.

16:37.026 --> 16:38.958
Another gift.

16:41.829 --> 16:44.664
No, I understand...

16:44.666 --> 16:47.567
We'll talk later...

16:47.569 --> 16:48.968
Okay. Bye, Grandma.

16:48.970 --> 16:50.637
What's going on?

16:53.941 --> 16:57.010
I don't think we'll be getting
any help from Dad's family.

16:59.914 --> 17:02.315
They think we should just "let
Mom's lawyer sort this out."

17:03.817 --> 17:05.751
They think she did it.

17:06.954 --> 17:09.088
Mom thinks that you believe that, too.

17:09.089 --> 17:11.391
I tried to tell her that wasn't true,

17:11.393 --> 17:12.925
but what I'm supposed to say?

17:12.926 --> 17:16.228
That the knife in our yard
is over a hundred years old?

17:16.230 --> 17:17.930
That it could get worse?

17:17.932 --> 17:20.031
That someone in our family
might have done something

17:20.034 --> 17:22.166
a long time ago that we're paying for now?

17:22.169 --> 17:24.770
Did you ask Dillon how
he got his hands on it?

17:24.771 --> 17:26.771
Dillon had nothing to do with this...

17:26.773 --> 17:29.041
So he comes in gives
you a hug all's forgiven?

17:29.043 --> 17:30.075
That's not what happened...

17:30.077 --> 17:31.109
What part am I missing?

17:31.111 --> 17:32.411
Look, you don't understand.

17:32.413 --> 17:34.279
Well, educate me. Please, I'd like to know.

17:34.281 --> 17:35.914
I think I know him a
little better than you!

17:35.916 --> 17:37.615
Really?

17:37.617 --> 17:38.616
How much better?

17:46.058 --> 17:48.726
Oh, wait a minute.

17:48.728 --> 17:50.127
Did you... did you two... ?

17:50.129 --> 17:52.096
Yes.

17:52.098 --> 17:53.130
Okay.

17:53.132 --> 17:54.332
When did this happen?

17:54.334 --> 17:56.167
Last week.

17:56.169 --> 17:59.103
And I really don't want
to talk about it with you.

17:59.105 --> 18:00.171
Wow.

18:00.173 --> 18:01.605
So you go all the way with the guy

18:01.607 --> 18:02.706
he disappears for three days.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.041
Good decision.

18:04.043 --> 18:06.643
He didn't "disappear,"
his parents sent him away.

18:06.645 --> 18:07.778
- Is that what he told you?
- Yeah.

18:07.780 --> 18:08.912
'Cause I heared he never left town.

18:08.914 --> 18:10.114
What?

18:10.116 --> 18:11.148
Who told you that?

18:13.051 --> 18:14.918
We'll see what he says to me.

18:14.920 --> 18:15.919
Luke, Where are you going?

18:15.921 --> 18:16.954
We have enough going on right now,

18:16.956 --> 18:17.955
Mom told me to...

18:17.957 --> 18:19.022
What to babysit me?

18:19.024 --> 18:20.190
No.

18:20.192 --> 18:21.959
To keep you from doing something stupid.

18:21.961 --> 18:24.862
Maybe I should have done the same for you.

18:27.999 --> 18:29.232
I can take care of this

18:29.234 --> 18:30.534
and you'd be home by this evening.

18:30.536 --> 18:32.002
I'm not letting you mortgage your business,

18:32.004 --> 18:33.003
it's all you have...

18:33.005 --> 18:38.241
Exactly. You have kids who need you.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.676
They're not kids anymore.

18:40.678 --> 18:42.212
They've had to grow up so fast.

18:42.214 --> 18:45.415
We were the same.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.850
Or at least you were.

18:47.852 --> 18:52.287
I remember the day you left for college.

18:52.289 --> 18:54.289
That was tough for me.

18:54.291 --> 19:00.162
You were the only classmate
I hoped would stay in town.

19:00.164 --> 19:01.230
Why is that?

19:01.232 --> 19:04.867
You actually talked to me.

19:04.869 --> 19:06.836
Didn't think I smelled like "chemicals."

19:06.838 --> 19:09.004
Or make jokes about my clothes

19:09.006 --> 19:11.140
being covered with "dead people dust."

19:14.210 --> 19:18.347
Having you there made high school bearable.

19:18.349 --> 19:19.948
Almost.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.817
You could've left too, you know, Ray?

19:22.819 --> 19:25.987
I know.

19:25.989 --> 19:28.657
But I didn't.

19:28.659 --> 19:33.327
There were... expectations,

19:33.329 --> 19:35.931
to take over the business.

19:35.933 --> 19:37.832
Do you regret it?

19:37.834 --> 19:39.868
No.

19:41.303 --> 19:44.738
Granted, I don't make a lot
of friends with the living,

19:44.740 --> 19:46.907
but...

19:46.909 --> 19:50.044
I try to give something
to those they've lost.

19:50.046 --> 19:52.080
Dignity.

19:52.082 --> 19:54.748
We're often robbed of it when we're alive.

20:03.191 --> 20:07.061
Please,

20:07.063 --> 20:10.064
let me help you.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.224
Hey, what's going on?

22:40.226 --> 22:42.259
- He "disappeared" again.
- Who?

22:42.261 --> 22:44.194
Dillon, I went to the school and his house.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.429
Nobody's there.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.231
Luke, he's not gonna give you any answers.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.965
Leave it alone. Let me work on Springer.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.501
I will get answers out of him.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.703
I don't care what happened
between him and my sister.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.771
What do you mean?

22:54.773 --> 22:58.007
What... what're you looking at?

22:58.009 --> 22:59.375
The trial that put Springer's father away.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.911
There were three of them involved,

23:00.913 --> 23:02.412
he's the only one who went to prison.

23:02.414 --> 23:05.881
I found an article in
the school library today.

23:05.883 --> 23:08.117
What happened between
Dillon and your sister?

23:11.888 --> 23:14.057
She has a blind spot when it comes to him

23:14.059 --> 23:15.825
because they...

23:15.827 --> 23:17.860
They what? What're you talking about?

23:17.862 --> 23:19.895
I think you know what I'm talking about.

23:22.365 --> 23:23.365
Seriously?

23:23.367 --> 23:25.067
Yes.

23:25.069 --> 23:26.936
Olivia and Dillon? When?

23:26.938 --> 23:28.804
Last week. I guess.

23:28.806 --> 23:30.906
I don't know.

23:30.908 --> 23:33.876
It's weird, I mean, my
sister did it before me.

23:33.878 --> 23:36.011
Well, she is four minutes older.

23:39.182 --> 23:41.350
C'mon, Luke, we can't have
this discussion again today.

23:41.352 --> 23:43.218
I'm just... I'm not ready.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.419
And I'd like to wait till
I'm out of high school.

23:44.421 --> 23:45.387
I thought you were okay with that.

23:45.389 --> 23:46.355
I am.

23:49.359 --> 23:50.658
I am.

24:16.117 --> 24:17.417
Hey.

24:18.786 --> 24:19.887
Hi.

24:21.389 --> 24:23.757
I don't think your dad can
help you guys at this point.

24:23.759 --> 24:26.827
That's not why I'm here.

24:26.829 --> 24:30.096
I was actually looking for Caleb.

24:30.098 --> 24:33.933
He's kind of out of commission.

24:33.935 --> 24:35.701
May want to give him an
hour or two to recover.

24:35.703 --> 24:36.869
From what?

24:38.339 --> 24:41.441
He had a, uh, "incident"
in the embalming room.

24:41.443 --> 24:44.877
What did your uncle do to him now?

24:44.879 --> 24:46.913
Well, I don't think it was him.

24:46.915 --> 24:50.149
There are other angry
residents at that house.

24:50.151 --> 24:52.885
I was with my uncle when it happened.

24:52.887 --> 24:53.953
And he was with your mom.

24:55.121 --> 24:56.155
Is she okay?

24:56.157 --> 24:57.657
Yeah.

25:00.126 --> 25:03.295
But she needs help, Olivia.

25:03.297 --> 25:05.097
And I think he may be
able to give it to her.

25:05.099 --> 25:08.600
No, we're not taking any
more "help" from Collins.

25:08.602 --> 25:09.834
He's a snake.

25:09.836 --> 25:12.971
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

25:12.973 --> 25:15.974
that snake may have some
warm blood in his veins.

25:18.244 --> 25:19.978
He seems to really care
about your mom, Olivia,

25:19.980 --> 25:21.245
like...

25:21.247 --> 25:22.313
for real.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.053
I don't know who to trust anymore.

25:28.055 --> 25:29.988
Look, I'm not saying
that you can trust him.

25:29.990 --> 25:36.227
I'm just saying, from my experience,

25:36.229 --> 25:38.429
if there's anything you
can do to keep your mom

25:38.431 --> 25:41.065
by your side, you should do it.

25:46.305 --> 25:48.172
I'm sorry about what I did to that chicken.

25:48.174 --> 25:49.740
It was fine.

25:49.742 --> 25:51.275
No, it wasn't.

25:51.277 --> 25:53.444
It was dry.

25:53.446 --> 25:55.746
But your mom will be back soon

25:55.748 --> 25:57.628
and we can go back to
eating food that's edible.

26:01.452 --> 26:02.886
Dad, who's covering
this story for the paper,

26:02.888 --> 26:03.954
about Luke's mom?

26:03.956 --> 26:06.090
Don't know yet.

26:06.092 --> 26:08.993
But I can assure you, this
time it'll be done fairly.

26:08.995 --> 26:12.095
What if the reporting's
fair, but the verdict isn't?

26:12.097 --> 26:13.296
It's happened before, right?

26:13.298 --> 26:15.198
Has the paper ever reported on that?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.733
A miscarriage of justice?

26:19.170 --> 26:20.370
Where are you going with this, sweetheart?

26:20.372 --> 26:21.971
What I'm saying is,

26:21.973 --> 26:23.640
has there ever a time when you wished

26:23.642 --> 26:25.942
you'd taken a position and you didn't?

26:25.944 --> 26:31.147
Remy, it's a small paper in a small town.

26:31.149 --> 26:33.850
You have to pick your battles.

26:33.852 --> 26:34.917
There have been times when I would've liked

26:34.919 --> 26:37.120
to have said or done more,

26:37.122 --> 26:40.123
but I think I've made the
right call more times than not.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.404
Olivia?

26:57.774 --> 26:59.475
I'm sorry I should have called first.

26:59.477 --> 27:02.310
Is your brother with you?

27:02.312 --> 27:05.113
Or has he already been here?

27:05.115 --> 27:06.148
No.

27:06.150 --> 27:09.117
He doesn't know I'm here.

27:10.853 --> 27:13.155
What can I do for you?

27:17.859 --> 27:19.760
I need you to help my mother.

27:35.058 --> 27:36.326
Who wrote this?

27:36.328 --> 27:37.827
You?

27:37.829 --> 27:39.195
Does it matter?

27:39.197 --> 27:41.096
All that's important
is that it gets printed.

27:41.098 --> 27:44.834
And what do you think that's gonna do?

27:44.836 --> 27:45.868
Put that in The Gazette,

27:45.870 --> 27:47.303
make people in this town question

27:47.305 --> 27:49.171
if your father got a bum rap.

27:49.173 --> 27:50.973
Was the jury biased?

27:50.975 --> 27:52.942
Was the judge corrupt?

27:52.944 --> 27:55.945
Maybe it's not too late
to change public opinion.

27:55.947 --> 27:57.079
Get him an early parole.

28:00.350 --> 28:02.885
Your father will never put this out there.

28:02.887 --> 28:06.755
My father is not above
admitting when he's wrong.

28:06.757 --> 28:09.123
I think he wishes he'd
printed that a long time ago.

28:11.694 --> 28:13.261
And you're willing to do this just to hear

28:13.263 --> 28:15.063
more about Dillon and that knife?

28:15.065 --> 28:18.967
You'd have to talk to
someone with a badge, too.

28:18.969 --> 28:21.836
But I think it's a pretty fair trade.

28:27.343 --> 28:28.977
So... ?

28:30.880 --> 28:32.347
Print it.

28:34.917 --> 28:37.118
Okay.

28:47.696 --> 28:48.863
Hold on a second.

28:48.865 --> 28:49.864
Luke... ?

28:49.866 --> 28:51.699
Hey, Mr. Price.

28:51.701 --> 28:53.367
Surprised to see you here.

28:53.369 --> 28:54.434
You weren't in school today.

28:54.436 --> 28:55.936
Uh, no. I...

28:55.938 --> 28:57.304
I've a lot of stuff going at home...

28:57.306 --> 28:59.106
Yeah, I heard about your mom.

28:59.108 --> 29:02.943
Look, I know things seem bleak right now,

29:02.945 --> 29:04.244
but it's going to be okay.

29:04.246 --> 29:06.079
How do you know that?

29:06.081 --> 29:08.348
Got to have faith in the system.

29:08.350 --> 29:10.083
Whatever you're looking for,

29:10.085 --> 29:11.250
you might not find it here.

29:11.252 --> 29:13.820
Kids can be cruel,

29:13.822 --> 29:14.921
they may say something...

29:14.923 --> 29:16.122
I don't care what they say.

29:16.124 --> 29:17.764
Just want to go watch the game, all right?

29:24.465 --> 29:26.866
Feeling any better?

29:28.135 --> 29:31.003
Little stiff. But that's to be expected.

29:31.005 --> 29:33.139
I was practically embalmed.

29:34.808 --> 29:36.242
Um, Caleb?

29:36.244 --> 29:37.743
What?

29:37.745 --> 29:40.980
There's something crawling on you.

29:40.982 --> 29:43.482
It's a huge spider.

29:43.484 --> 29:44.950
Where is it?

29:44.952 --> 29:46.051
It's on your arm, it's
headed for your shoulder.

29:46.053 --> 29:47.052
Can you get it?

29:47.054 --> 29:48.253
What, no.

29:48.255 --> 29:49.856
I couldn't even get if I was still alive.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.158
Is it gone?

29:53.160 --> 29:55.461
Yeah.

29:55.463 --> 29:57.763
I don't miss those things.

29:57.765 --> 29:58.697
Or mosquitoes.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.840
This place is awesome.

30:08.842 --> 30:09.807
Yeah, told you.

30:09.809 --> 30:13.011
Not exactly a closet of demons.

30:13.013 --> 30:15.146
You never know what's
hiding in the prayer books.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.883
This altar reminds me of
a place I used to go to

30:18.885 --> 30:20.985
when I was little.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.419
It's my second foster family.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.756
They went to this sweet little church.

30:25.758 --> 30:28.392
They burned incense
that smelled like nutmeg.

30:28.394 --> 30:31.295
Felt like Christmas all year long.

30:33.731 --> 30:35.099
Was the best part of my week.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.633
Are you gonna help me?

30:38.269 --> 30:41.372
Sorry. I was having a moment.

31:09.966 --> 31:11.800
Miranda... ?

31:11.802 --> 31:13.335
Look.

31:14.870 --> 31:17.139
Can you read that?

31:17.141 --> 31:19.741
Are these the names from Remy's dream?

31:19.743 --> 31:21.976
You mean the one where she
saw them signing The Pact?

31:21.978 --> 31:24.913
She said there were six elders who signed.

31:24.915 --> 31:26.181
These must be their names.

31:26.183 --> 31:27.682
Why six?

31:27.684 --> 31:28.816
What do you mean?

31:28.818 --> 31:30.117
If there are five kids who are marked,

31:30.119 --> 31:31.385
then why would there be six?

31:31.387 --> 31:33.821
I don't know.

31:33.823 --> 31:36.157
But Matheson isn't even on here.

31:36.159 --> 31:37.926
My family name is the only one that is.

31:37.928 --> 31:39.427
What about Collins?

31:39.429 --> 31:41.195
It's not there.

31:41.197 --> 31:43.831
Remy's name isn't here either.

31:43.833 --> 31:47.000
Hey, what's Dillon's last name again?

31:47.002 --> 31:48.135
Isn't it Sanders?

32:05.219 --> 32:07.320
Remy?

32:07.322 --> 32:09.222
Dad, why're you sitting in the dark?

32:13.327 --> 32:14.928
Sit down.

32:23.170 --> 32:25.105
What were you thinking?

32:25.107 --> 32:27.140
Dad... Don't even bother.

32:27.142 --> 32:29.875
I know what you were thinking.

32:29.877 --> 32:31.711
You thought condemning
this town for what happened

32:31.713 --> 32:32.945
to Zack Springer's father

32:32.947 --> 32:35.014
would somehow save Luke's mother.

32:35.016 --> 32:38.818
Springer's the one who
can save Luke's mother.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.419
I did this so I could get him to talk.

32:40.421 --> 32:42.387
You did this without thinking it through.

32:42.389 --> 32:43.923
Why're you getting angry?

32:43.925 --> 32:45.224
Last night, you practically admitted

32:45.226 --> 32:46.258
that you felt the same way.

32:46.260 --> 32:47.326
All I was doing...

32:47.328 --> 32:49.128
... was putting words in my mouth.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.930
You're entitled to your opinions, not mine.

32:51.932 --> 32:54.199
You not only compromised my credibility,

32:54.201 --> 32:56.335
you threatened the integrity
of the entire paper.

32:56.337 --> 32:58.337
Luke's mother is sleeping
in a jail cell tonight!

32:58.339 --> 33:00.305
I had to find a way to help his family!

33:00.307 --> 33:01.773
At the expense of your own?

33:01.775 --> 33:04.309
Do you have any idea what your grandfather

33:04.311 --> 33:06.811
went through to buy this newspaper?

33:06.813 --> 33:08.446
To have a voice in this town?

33:08.448 --> 33:10.414
Do you have any idea

33:10.416 --> 33:12.717
how many years our family was invisible?

33:12.719 --> 33:16.655
What's the point of having
a voice if you don't use it?

33:16.657 --> 33:19.590
You're not the publisher
of this paper, Remy.

33:24.863 --> 33:28.065
In fact, as of right now,

33:28.067 --> 33:29.300
you no longer work there.

33:32.937 --> 33:36.140
Dad, this is about a lot
more than Luke's mom...

33:36.142 --> 33:37.575
What?

33:39.878 --> 33:41.712
What more is it about?

33:47.085 --> 33:48.351
That's what I thought.

33:58.904 --> 34:00.671
I don't understand.

34:00.709 --> 34:01.941
If Dillon's family signed it, too,

34:01.943 --> 34:03.342
wouldn't he be marked?

34:03.344 --> 34:04.844
Well, he probably is.

34:04.846 --> 34:06.279
But he wasn't in the car with us.

34:06.281 --> 34:08.514
Why would Springer be
pointing the finger at him?

34:08.516 --> 34:11.083
Good question.

34:11.085 --> 34:13.166
And what does Dillon get
by pinning this on your mom?

34:41.915 --> 34:45.050
What's up, Luke?

34:45.052 --> 34:47.018
What are you doing here?

34:47.021 --> 34:49.387
Where you have been last three days, man?

34:49.389 --> 34:51.356
What is this?

34:51.358 --> 34:54.092
Answer me.

34:54.094 --> 34:57.094
Look, man, I know you're hurting,

34:57.097 --> 34:58.763
your family is going through
a lot of crap right now.

34:58.765 --> 35:01.833
How much of that crap are
you responsible for, Dillon?

35:10.175 --> 35:11.508
What the hell are you doing?

35:11.510 --> 35:13.044
And what are you looking for?

35:15.748 --> 35:17.348
Why did Springer say you
made him plant that knife?

35:17.350 --> 35:18.649
You let go of me.

35:18.651 --> 35:19.683
Answer the question.

35:19.685 --> 35:20.951
Let go of me!

35:40.404 --> 35:43.106
What is this? Huh?

35:43.108 --> 35:46.143
You can kick the crap out of me, Luke.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.744
Might make you feel better for a minute.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.814
But it won't change anything for you.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.282
What're you talking about, man?

35:52.284 --> 35:54.817
You can't hurt me.

35:54.819 --> 35:55.918
I'm not in this alone.

35:58.088 --> 36:00.055
I've got back-up.

36:00.057 --> 36:01.691
What does that mean?

36:01.693 --> 36:03.225
It means I found a way out!

36:03.227 --> 36:05.728
And you can too, before it's too late.

36:05.730 --> 36:06.996
Found a way out of what?

36:06.998 --> 36:08.298
The Pact, Luke.

36:08.300 --> 36:12.067
I made a deal when I could.

36:12.069 --> 36:13.368
I'm out of it.

36:13.370 --> 36:15.604
You made a deal with who?

36:17.440 --> 36:19.909
My advice?

36:19.911 --> 36:22.144
Offer up someone he really wants.

36:23.746 --> 36:25.647
He was happy to take
your sister instead of me.

36:25.649 --> 36:28.583
Who was happy? Huh?

36:30.085 --> 36:30.985
Who was happy?

36:41.364 --> 36:42.931
Who is in there?

36:48.137 --> 36:49.270
Who is that?

38:47.816 --> 38:51.186
Hey, this is Dillon.
Leave a message, thanks.

38:54.024 --> 38:56.090
Luke?

39:00.028 --> 39:00.928
Luke... ?

39:03.031 --> 39:04.031
He isn't here.

39:05.734 --> 39:06.901
How did you get home?

39:06.903 --> 39:08.536
Mr. Collins dropped me off.

39:08.538 --> 39:11.038
Mom, I'm sorry... I
didn't know what to do...

39:11.040 --> 39:12.139
nobody else was willing to help...

39:12.141 --> 39:13.673
There's nothing to be sorry about.

39:13.675 --> 39:15.575
You did the right thing.

39:15.577 --> 39:17.511
We're lucky to have him in our lives.

39:20.648 --> 39:21.982
So this is it, right?

39:21.984 --> 39:23.217
You're home? You get to stay here...

39:23.219 --> 39:24.751
For now.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.853
But honey, this is just getting started.

39:26.855 --> 39:29.155
But we'll get through
it, we'll do it together.

39:29.157 --> 39:32.025
Right now, I need to get out
of these clothes and shower.

39:32.027 --> 39:33.527
Where's your brother?

39:35.029 --> 39:36.463
I don't know.

39:36.465 --> 39:37.931
He ran out.

39:37.933 --> 39:39.533
I tried to stop him, but
he wouldn't listen to me.

39:39.535 --> 39:40.600
He is not answering his phone.

39:40.602 --> 39:41.868
Try Remy. Find him.

39:41.870 --> 39:42.936
I want him home.

39:42.938 --> 39:44.070
Okay.

40:27.046 --> 40:29.047
Oh my God. What happened to you?

40:29.049 --> 40:30.615
Has he been here? Have you seen him?

40:30.617 --> 40:32.050
Who? What're you talking about?

40:33.986 --> 40:35.653
Did you get in a fight with Dillon?

40:36.889 --> 40:38.990
That's Mom. She's home.

40:38.992 --> 40:41.493
Mr. Collins posted her bail.

40:41.495 --> 40:42.861
Why would he do that?

40:42.863 --> 40:45.697
Because I asked him to.

40:45.699 --> 40:47.131
Oh yeah?

40:47.133 --> 40:48.533
And how're we gonna pay him back?

40:48.535 --> 40:51.268
Maybe you ought to ask
your "boyfriend" about that.

40:51.270 --> 40:52.136
Ask him what?

40:53.838 --> 40:55.672
How he's going to pay Collins back.

40:55.674 --> 40:57.808
What're you talking about?

40:57.810 --> 40:58.310
Okay...

41:02.482 --> 41:04.882
Dillon was supposed to be in that car

41:04.884 --> 41:06.083
that went over the bridge.

41:06.085 --> 41:07.651
How do you know about this?

41:07.653 --> 41:08.653
Are you talking to Caleb?

41:08.654 --> 41:09.953
I spoken to Dillon!

41:09.955 --> 41:11.655
Maybe you need to ask him
why you were in that car

41:11.657 --> 41:12.656
and he wasn't.

41:12.658 --> 41:13.857
Luke, stop.

41:13.859 --> 41:15.158
Dillon may not even know if he's marked.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.928
He knows.

41:17.930 --> 41:19.830
He knew before we knew.

41:21.833 --> 41:25.001
He gave you up so he could save himself.

41:28.172 --> 41:30.206
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

41:30.208 --> 41:33.176
That's crazy. Dillon cares about me...

41:33.178 --> 41:36.179
I'm sure he does.

41:36.181 --> 41:37.813
I'm guessing that's what sealed the deal.

41:39.783 --> 41:41.551
It's got to cost him something.

41:42.886 --> 41:44.420
Luke... ? Is that you?

41:48.124 --> 41:49.692
Hey, Mom.

41:49.694 --> 41:50.960
Welcome home.

42:43.314 --> 42:48.273
