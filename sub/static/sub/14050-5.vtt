WEBVTT

00:17.760 --> 00:21.160
Detective Inspector Poole. I take it you're here for me?

00:21.200 --> 00:22.720
Very good.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.400
What gave us away?

00:24.440 --> 00:26.240
Well, unless you're on some weird stag do.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.360
Vincent Carter.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.760
This is the prisoner, Leon Hamilton.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.880
He is officially now in your custody.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.720
But I've been given orders to escort you to Sainte-Marie.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.560
Thank you, Vincent. Mr Hamilton, do you understand

00:41.600 --> 00:43.400
that on arrival

00:43.440 --> 00:46.080
we will take you directly to Sainte-Marie jail,

00:46.120 --> 00:49.960
where you'll serve the remainder

00:46.120 --> 00:49.960
of your sentence?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.800
WOMAN: <i> Good afternoon,</i> <i>ladies and gentlemen....</i>

00:51.840 --> 00:54.080
-VINCENT:<i> Pardon.</i> <i>-...the ferry is</i>

00:51.840 --> 00:54.080
<i>leaving in 10 minutes.</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:56.560
<i>Please board at</i> <i>Gate 1 immediately.</i>

01:00.120 --> 01:01.560
After you.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.760
So, you've been to Sainte

01:12.800 --> 01:15.960
Not that you'll actually see much of it from inside the

01:12.800 --> 01:15.960
prison, of course.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.840
Perhaps when you get out.

01:17.880 --> 01:21.120
I suppose I ought to make the best

01:17.880 --> 01:21.120
of the view while I still can.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.880
-Not really.

01:40.920 --> 01:44.880
I think Agatha Christie is my favourite.

01:40.920 --> 01:44.880
<i>Murder on the Orient Express.</i>

01:44.920 --> 01:47.040
Now, that was a good book.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.680
Unlike this, where the murder victim died

01:49.720 --> 01:52.920
actually clutching a photograph

01:49.720 --> 01:52.920
of his killer.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.440
From what I've read so far,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.080
the only way this case could have been

01:54.480 --> 01:56.080
any easier

01:56.120 --> 01:58.280
is if the murderer had "Yes, I did it"

01:58.320 --> 02:00.680
tattooed on his forehead.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.040
Then you wouldn't need a murder detective at all.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.880
A trained chimp would suffice.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.600
Inspector Bubbles of the Yard. Got a ring to it.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.000
I do love a good murder.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.240
It's always a bit rough when we leave the harbour

02:23.280 --> 02:26.400
-just until we get round the point.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.400
-I'm sorry,

02:26.440 --> 02:29.240
but do you think I could stretch my legs

02:26.440 --> 02:29.240
for a bit?

02:31.840 --> 02:36.040
-I really don't feel too good. -Very well.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.680
Everything okay?

02:38.720 --> 02:41.480
RICHARD: Wants to stretch his legs for a bit.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.960
-VINCENT:<i> Pardon, monsieur.</i>

02:48.000 --> 02:49.960
You think you'll be sick?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.480
A warning would be appreciated if you do.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.200
Just so that I can take wind direction

02:54.040 --> 02:56.200
into account,

02:56.240 --> 02:58.520
take evasive action.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.400
You know, I can't say I blame you.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.960
Excuse me.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.280
Never liked waves.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.480
Not since a family holiday to the Isle of

03:07.320 --> 03:10.480
Wight when I was nine.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.760
That was a ferry.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.880
The<i> SS Vomit,</i> I think it was called.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.880
Whoa, there we go.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.960
Sorry, probably not helping, is it?

03:27.920 --> 03:29.720
Vincent!

03:30.760 --> 03:32.360
Nobody move!

03:32.400 --> 03:33.840
Vincent!

04:16.440 --> 04:19.440
-Leon Hamilton, the prisoner.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.920
I'm afraid we lost him.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.080
-No.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.520
Lost him as in... You know, dead.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.600
What was it, a heart attack?

04:28.640 --> 04:31.000
While he was still handcuffed to you?

04:28.640 --> 04:31.000
That's terrible.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.120
RICHARD: No, it wasn't a heart attack,

04:31.040 --> 04:33.120
it was more...

04:33.800 --> 04:35.480
Murdered.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.400
-Stabbed, to be precise.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.520
Wait, wait. Someone murdered him while he was still

04:37.440 --> 04:40.520
handcuffed to you?

04:40.560 --> 04:42.920
I want a full passenger list. And do background checks.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.440
See if you can find any link with the deceased.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.040
Don't forget the ferry crew.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.560
And you didn't see who it was?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.320
I looked away for one second.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.480
-Nothing.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.440
-No.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.040
I thought he asked you to collect

05:08.760 --> 05:11.040
the prisoner in person

05:11.080 --> 05:13.680
to ensure the transfer went smoothly?

05:16.240 --> 05:19.320
-No.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.480
-I'm not a child!

05:21.520 --> 05:24.680
Okay.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.480
COMMISSIONER: Have you any idea how much paperwork

05:24.720 --> 05:29.480
this will generate?

05:29.520 --> 05:31.480
What on earth were you doing?

05:31.520 --> 05:34.800
How can someone murder the person

05:31.520 --> 05:34.800
standing next to you

05:34.840 --> 05:36.760
and you not even notice?

05:36.800 --> 05:39.680
I mean, it should be funny. It sounds funny.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.960
They're laughing at Government House.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.440
Laughing when they see me. What kind of laughing!

05:45.480 --> 05:47.880
Where were you?

05:47.920 --> 05:50.920
The sea was rough around the point.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.920
It happened so fast.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.200
I've spoken to your superiors.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.400
You will stay on the island until I release you.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.360
-Sir... -It isn't a request.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.320
They're arranging some accommodation for you.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.560
And I want a report on my desk by the first

06:01.360 --> 06:03.560
thing in the morning.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.880
Sir.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.920
Now, get out of my sight!

06:10.080 --> 06:13.120
It wasn't his fault, sir. The prisoner

06:10.080 --> 06:13.120
was in my custody.

06:13.160 --> 06:17.560
I'd say that's hardly something

06:13.160 --> 06:17.560
to be proud of, Inspector.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.240
I could understand if he was secretly poisoned.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.680
In fact, secretly anything.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.080
I could even forgive a gunshot from another boat,

06:27.120 --> 06:29.440
or a jet ski, or a helicopter.

06:29.480 --> 06:33.440
But no, a knife was plunged into his back

06:33.480 --> 06:35.640
while you were standing next to him.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.160
Joined at the wrists!

06:44.360 --> 06:45.680
CAMILLE: Sir. FIDEL: Sir.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.400
Sir.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.840
CAMILLE: Are you okay?

06:55.880 --> 07:00.600
The Commissioner and I had a frank exchange of views

07:00.640 --> 07:03.360
and it was decided I hadn't exactly

07:00.640 --> 07:03.360
covered myself in glory

07:03.400 --> 07:06.320
as far as the prisoner's transfer

07:03.400 --> 07:06.320
was concerned.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.480
I wholeheartedly agreed with him

07:09.520 --> 07:12.800
and suggested I be shipped back

07:09.520 --> 07:12.800
to London in disgrace.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.080
He refused. But it was worth a try.

07:17.120 --> 07:21.160
So, as I'm still stuck here,

07:21.200 --> 07:25.320
I intend to find the person who murdered Leon Hamilton,

07:26.360 --> 07:29.400
that caused me no little embarrassment,

07:29.440 --> 07:32.480
if it's the last thing I ever do.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.200
In fact, to coin a phrase,

07:35.240 --> 07:37.400
this time it's personal.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.840
Where is the bin? There is never a bin!

07:42.720 --> 07:44.320
Thank you.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.160
CAMILLE: I spoke to the coroner. He'll do

07:44.360 --> 07:47.160
the autopsy later today.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.520
But it looks like a single knife wound, entry point under

07:47.200 --> 07:50.520
the shoulderblade.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.720
And it must have pierced the heart in order for death

07:50.560 --> 07:54.720
to be instantaneous.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.160
And you think it was

08:00.200 --> 08:01.680
I may have missed the actual blow, Camille,

08:01.720 --> 08:03.800
but I think I'd have noticed if he'd started screaming

08:03.840 --> 08:05.480
and clutching at his back.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.640
Sorry.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.560
Right, what about the passengers?

08:16.600 --> 08:20.520
We've got witness statements but it will take a while

08:16.600 --> 08:20.520
to crosscheck them.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.920
Right, you get onto that.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.680
Fidel, I want Leon Hamilton's

08:21.960 --> 08:24.680
file sent over.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.120
I want to know details of his circle.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.120
Business associates, lovers, jealous siblings,

08:30.160 --> 08:32.680
anyone who may have had a reason to kill him.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.840
I also want the autopsy report and any forensics

08:32.720 --> 08:35.840
on the murder weapon

08:35.880 --> 08:39.600
-on my desk the second they're done.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.600
-Yes, sir.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.280
-Well, means and opportunity

08:42.320 --> 08:45.560
are self-evident, so the key has to be motive.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.240
Who wanted Leon Hamilton dead?

09:03.280 --> 09:04.680
He's dead.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.680
And you owe me 50 grand.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.200
There were 180 passengers, we can maybe

09:11.000 --> 09:14.200
discount 50 of those.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.240
-We have witness statements

09:16.280 --> 09:18.560
placing them either in the inside

09:16.280 --> 09:18.560
section or in a group.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.120
That still leaves 130 suspects.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.000
-DWAYNE: Nothing.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.720
The ferry captain also said you were only about a mile

09:24.040 --> 09:26.720
away from the coast

09:26.760 --> 09:28.680
when the victim was found dead.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.840
Meaning someone could have left the ferry and

09:28.720 --> 09:30.840
swum to the shore

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
-after the murder. -So, we can't even be sure

09:32.920 --> 09:35.320
that the killer was still on the ferry

09:32.920 --> 09:35.320
when you got to Sainte

09:35.360 --> 09:38.120
If you're looking at potential suspects, I think I could

09:35.360 --> 09:38.120
add some names.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.800
-Oh, just about 900.

09:44.200 --> 09:47.680
RICHARD: Well, it's hardly my idea

09:44.200 --> 09:47.680
of a luxury resort.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.720
A tad underdeveloped, you might say.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.520
-FIDEL: About two years ago,

09:53.560 --> 09:56.560
hundreds of people on the island

09:53.560 --> 09:56.560
invested in Paradise Beach.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.400
When it went under, they all lost their money.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.280
It was worse than that. Small businesses

09:59.440 --> 10:02.280
put their money in

10:02.320 --> 10:05.000
hoping to get the catering and cleaning contracts.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.720
Other people put their pension funds in.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.840
-It destroyed a lot of lives. -That's terrible.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.400
The construction company was based in Guadeloupe.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.240
Leon Hamilton was charged with embezzlement and

10:13.440 --> 10:16.240
false accounting.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.920
Which explains why the Commissioner

10:16.280 --> 10:18.920
wanted him to come and finish

10:18.960 --> 10:20.520
his sentence on Sainte-Marie.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.000
So that justice could be seen to be done.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.000
Yeah.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.120
-The Commissioner's name is on here too.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.960
I doubt it. Mmm-mmm.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.360
But officially, if

10:30.000 --> 10:33.360
the Commissioner lost money,

10:33.400 --> 10:34.800
does that make him a suspect?

10:34.840 --> 10:37.480
I imagine it does.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.600
Who wants to be the first to interview him?

10:41.640 --> 10:46.000
No? Right, well, let's cross him off

10:41.640 --> 10:46.000
for now, shall we?

10:46.040 --> 10:48.320
So, we've got a man murdered in broad daylight

10:48.360 --> 10:50.120
while handcuffed to a police officer,

10:50.160 --> 10:53.800
just over a thousand suspects and it's 100 degrees.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.480
Marvellous.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.840
That's odd.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.160
Says here Leon Hamilton was a keen sailor,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.160
had his own yacht.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.320
Is that important?

11:16.360 --> 11:18.160
Well, it was a bit rough as we left the harbour

11:18.200 --> 11:20.680
and he complained of feeling sick.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.080
Why would he feel seasick if he was

11:20.720 --> 11:24.080
an experienced sailor?

11:25.200 --> 11:28.680
Did he actually say he was seasick?

11:28.720 --> 11:31.720
-No. -Then it could have

11:28.720 --> 11:31.720
been something else.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.320
I suppose so.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.000
Fidel, tell them I want a toxicology

11:33.360 --> 11:36.000
report on the victim,

11:36.040 --> 11:37.880
-just to be on the safe side. -Yes, sir.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.720
I have a woman here who said she spoke

11:37.920 --> 11:41.720
to the officer on the ferry.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.320
They talked about the book he was reading?

11:44.360 --> 11:46.200
Yeah, that was before we went outside.

11:46.240 --> 11:50.960
Um, said she loved a good murder.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.880
Susie Park. On her way to visit

11:51.000 --> 11:55.880
grandparents in Sainte-Marie.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.560
Check to see if her grandparents

11:55.920 --> 11:59.560
are on the investors list.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.520
In fact, we should check everyone

11:59.600 --> 12:02.520
on the passengers list

12:05.560 --> 12:07.240
-Okay, I know this guy. -Sainte-Marie police station.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.720
-Samuel King.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.720
-He's bad news.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.760
-Very.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.760
-Put him on the A pile. -Thank you.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.280
Leon Hamilton's wife is flying in from

12:15.800 --> 12:19.280
Guadeloupe tomorrow morning

12:19.320 --> 12:21.200
to formally identify the body.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.600
Okay, you'd better go and meet her.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.240
See if you can get her story while you're at it.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.520
Okay.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.240
It's late, we should call it a day.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.440
Oh!

12:46.360 --> 12:48.240
How was your day?

12:49.800 --> 12:53.440
That bad, eh? Although I'm assuming

12:49.800 --> 12:53.440
no one actually died,

12:54.680 --> 12:57.280
which means I almost certainly have you beat.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.600


13:11.920 --> 13:13.520
Okay, thank you, sir, we have your details.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.000
Thank you.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.400
-That's the third one this week.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.880
An old beggar woman.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.320
She stops tourists by asking them for money.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.760
When they take out their wallet or purse,

13:22.360 --> 13:25.760
she snatches it and runs.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.640
-Morning, team. -Morning, sir.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.400
DWAYNE: Chief. CAMILLE:

13:27.680 --> 13:29.400
Where were you last night?

13:29.440 --> 13:31.680
Ah, yes, sorry, I went straight home.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.160
Hopeless.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.840
The ferry was bound for Sainte-Marie

13:36.200 --> 13:38.840
so virtually everybody on it

13:38.880 --> 13:43.080
knew someone who'd lost money on the Paradise Beach complex.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.320
The autopsy and toxicology reports are done but

13:43.120 --> 13:46.320
the email is down.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.000
They're phoning them through in 10 minutes.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.800
Okay. Dwayne and Fidel, I want you to

13:48.040 --> 13:49.800
start rounding up

13:49.840 --> 13:51.400
everyone on our A list.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.440
Let's start eliminating who we can.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.160
-Yes, Chief. -Let's find out

13:55.200 --> 13:57.840
if there were any bigger investors

13:55.200 --> 13:57.840
in Paradise Beach.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.440
Anyone who lost enough money to want to kill Leon Hamilton.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.040
We've got details of the bank,

14:03.080 --> 14:05.440
so I'll call them on my way to the airport.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.560
-Mrs Hamilton is

14:05.480 --> 14:07.560
coming to identify

14:07.600 --> 14:10.440
-Ah, yes. Sorry.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.320
-Oh,

14:10.480 --> 14:13.320
that should be the autopsy.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.440
Great. Put it on speaker phone.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.680
-DI Richard Poole. <i>-# Happy birthday to you</i>

14:19.720 --> 14:23.280
<i># Happy birthday to you</i> <i>Happy birthday... #</i>

14:23.320 --> 14:27.160
Mum, Dad, yeah, thank you.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.120
Yes, the birthday card came yesterday and the parcel

14:27.200 --> 14:31.120
came this morning.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.080
Thank you again.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.480
No, always good to send separately,

14:33.120 --> 14:35.480
just in case.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.480
Yep, yep.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.960
Listen, Mum, I'm actually at work

14:38.520 --> 14:40.960
and, um...

14:41.000 --> 14:44.320
Well, I'm about to go into a meeting.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.320
So, could we do this later?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.760
Yeah. Thanks again.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.160
Yeah, you too. Yeah, bye.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.680
-Happy birthday. -Happy birthday, sir.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.720
None of your business how old I am.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.280
Now, would everybody please just get on with

15:02.760 --> 15:05.280
the tasks I've set them?

15:08.640 --> 15:11.800


15:29.200 --> 15:30.640
Morning. Thank you.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.000
That can't have been easy.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.000
I've never seen a dead body before.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.400
Have you any family here

16:02.320 --> 16:04.240
It's just us.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.720
Me now.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.760
You must have loved him very much.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.480
Yes.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.640
If you're ready, I can take you to your hotel.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.360
Oh. I'm ready, I think.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.320
This is terribly exciting.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.400
I just need enough information to eliminate you from

16:28.360 --> 16:31.400
our enquiries, Mrs...

16:31.440 --> 16:34.320
Miss Park.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.760
-Miss Park. -I love being interviewed.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.240
When I took the prisoner upstairs

16:36.800 --> 16:39.240
to the outside seating area,

16:39.280 --> 16:41.200
I recall you came out a few moments later.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.680
Yes.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.520
And you were aware that I was with the prisoner?

16:44.560 --> 16:46.480
Yes, I saw you at the rail.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.680
He was bent over, it looked like

16:46.520 --> 16:48.680
he was being sick.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.280
And during your time outside, did you see anyone

16:52.320 --> 16:55.080
with a knife or acting

16:52.320 --> 16:55.080
particularly suspiciously?

16:55.120 --> 16:57.000
No.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.920
The boat was a bit rocky. I was just holding on,

16:57.040 --> 16:59.920
to be honest.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.680
Um...

17:01.720 --> 17:03.640
your grandparents,

17:03.680 --> 17:06.640
they invested in the Paradise Beach

17:03.680 --> 17:06.640
complex a couple of years ago.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.640
Yes.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.680
You weren't aware that the prisoner

17:08.680 --> 17:10.680
was Leon Hamilton,

17:10.720 --> 17:12.400
the man convicted of fraud when it went bust?

17:12.440 --> 17:14.320
No, I wasn't.

17:14.360 --> 17:15.960
-No!

17:16.000 --> 17:18.440
But if I had, I would have quite happily murdered him.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.640
He took everything my grandparents had,

17:18.480 --> 17:21.640
every last penny.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.960
I'm sorry.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.760
That makes me a suspect, doesn't it?

17:26.800 --> 17:28.800
Fidel.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.120
Of course, I'll make myself completely available should

17:28.840 --> 17:31.120
you need me again.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.560
Would you like my passport?

17:33.600 --> 17:35.680
No, it's okay. Thank you for

17:33.600 --> 17:35.680
your help, Miss Park.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.560
Have a good day.

17:39.680 --> 17:43.080
-She seemed very chirpy. -Mad as a bag of frogs.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.520
-Yes, sir.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.200
Came through while you were with Miss Park.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.720
Single wound through the heart,

17:47.240 --> 17:49.720
just like you said.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.440
Hmm. Anything else?

17:51.480 --> 17:53.200
No other injuries, no.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.200
-All clear.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.120
Forensics on the murder weapon is with the report.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.120
No fingerprints.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
We're also checking on the make of the knife

18:00.200 --> 18:02.680
and possible outlets that sell them. But it's

18:00.200 --> 18:02.680
a pretty common blade.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.160
-Thank, Fidel. -Yes, sir.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.240
I was hoping I could spend some time

18:09.880 --> 18:12.240
in the market today.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.000
Around lunchtime. See if I can find

18:12.280 --> 18:15.000
our beggar thief.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.160
-Yes, sir.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.160
A woman posing as a beggar stealing from tourists.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.400
I hate this kind of crime, sir. It reflects badly

18:21.200 --> 18:24.400
on the whole island.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.640
And two of her last three thefts

18:24.440 --> 18:26.640
were around lunchtime, so...

18:26.680 --> 18:29.640
-Modus operandi. -Yes, sir.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.560
Then of course you must go.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.280
Vincent.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.600
-It isn't.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.840
-Ah. -Turns out

18:45.880 --> 18:47.720
he was the most unpopular man on the island.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.400
So, I'm knee deep in suspects.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.240
-No. Two or three's good.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.080
Then you can whittle away

18:56.120 --> 18:58.880
by a process of gradual elimination.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.960
Nine hundred and seven just muddies the waters.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.600
Whoa, whoa, what's that?

19:04.640 --> 19:07.120
I heard it was someone's birthday.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.240
I'm a year older. It hardly warrants

19:07.160 --> 19:10.240
a firework display.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.360
-Take it away. -I thought you'd like it.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.840
Well, I don't.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.720
I came for a walk to clear my head

19:13.880 --> 19:15.720
and a decent cup of tea.

19:15.760 --> 19:19.120
So just a pot of tea, please, without any form of

19:15.760 --> 19:19.120
incendiary attached.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.040
I think you might have upset her.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.240
She's French, it's an occupational hazard.

19:26.280 --> 19:28.840
Listen, I'm sorry we're making slow progress.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.360
-You must be keen to get home. -A little.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.000
I'll have a word with the Commissioner,

19:33.040 --> 19:34.680
there's no point you being stuck here.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.320
Thank you.

19:36.360 --> 19:40.080
-Not that well.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.800
I'd see him in the association

19:40.120 --> 19:42.800
room sometimes.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.080
But I work in admissions, so...

19:45.120 --> 19:48.720
There are over 300 prisoners in the jail.

19:48.760 --> 19:52.360
Men like Leon Hamilton tend to keep

19:48.760 --> 19:52.360
their heads down. Yeah, that's the thing,

19:52.400 --> 19:56.000
you see, he didn't strike me as a conman.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.400
-There was no brashness. -Oh.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.600
In fact, I'd say there was a...

19:59.440 --> 20:03.600
sadness about him.

20:03.640 --> 20:07.480
Well, he was going from one prison to another.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.800
-True. -CAMILLE:

20:07.520 --> 20:10.800
Dwayne said you were here.

20:10.840 --> 20:13.160
Vincent, you remember Detective Sergeant Bordey.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.080
Hello, Vincent. You found us, then.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.440
I suggested he came here for his meals.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.560
Catherine has been very thoughtful.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.680
Yes, he has that effect on my mother.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.920
-<i> Au revoir,</i> Catherine. -<i> Au revoir,</i> Vincent.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.520
Got a spoon?

20:39.560 --> 20:43.440
So, Mrs Hamilton formally identified

20:39.560 --> 20:43.440
her husband.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.560
She told me she has little to do

20:43.480 --> 20:46.560
with his business.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.960
And she was as shocked as everyone else when he was

20:46.600 --> 20:50.960
found guilty of fraud.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Oh. How long is she staying on Sainte

20:53.040 --> 20:56.520
Just long enough to make the funeral arrangements.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.280
Mmm. Is she, um,

21:00.320 --> 21:02.200
not having the body shipped home?

21:02.240 --> 21:05.000
No. She said he used to sail on the islands

21:05.040 --> 21:08.120
and he loved Sainte-Marie, so she wants

21:05.040 --> 21:08.120
him cremated here.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.520
I'm here.

21:24.800 --> 21:28.400
Leon Hamilton told me he'd never been

21:24.800 --> 21:28.400
to Sainte-Marie before

21:28.440 --> 21:30.880
and yet now his wife is saying he often sailed here

21:30.920 --> 21:33.000
and it was his favourite destination.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.920
Haven't you ever heard of a husband and wife who

21:33.040 --> 21:35.920
don't communicate?

21:35.960 --> 21:41.040
Yeah, when added to the fact that supposedly he was

21:35.960 --> 21:41.040
an experienced sailor

21:41.080 --> 21:43.560
who felt seasick on a ferry,

21:43.600 --> 21:45.480
then something just doesn't add up.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.040
Like what?

21:50.680 --> 21:52.240
Maybe he lied to his wife about where he'd been

21:52.280 --> 21:54.720
to cover up an affair.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.840
Maybe she was lying about him loving Sainte-Marie

21:56.880 --> 21:59.680
because their marriage was a sham and she didn't

21:56.880 --> 21:59.680
care about him enough

21:59.720 --> 22:01.280
to go to the trouble of having him shipped home.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.480
-No, she loved him, I'm sure of it.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.680
I talked to her.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.160
And you can tell whether people are in love

22:08.200 --> 22:09.720
just by talking to them, can you?

22:10.800 --> 22:12.240
Yes.

22:12.280 --> 22:16.400
By what they say, their eyes, the tone of their voice...

22:16.440 --> 22:18.640
-I find that very hard to believe.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.280
CAMILLE: Have you ever been in love?

22:27.280 --> 22:30.000
Look, this has to be connected with Hamilton and his

22:27.280 --> 22:30.000
business dealings.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.120
-No,

22:30.040 --> 22:33.120
they haven't got back to me.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.400
Then let's start there.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.400
CAMILLE: What about Samuel King's statement?

23:16.440 --> 23:17.880
Anything of interest?

23:19.400 --> 23:23.400
He's been around long enough not to give too much away.

23:23.440 --> 23:27.320
I asked him why he was on the ferry.

23:23.440 --> 23:27.320
He said he was sightseeing.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.520
He denies knowing the victim.

23:31.560 --> 23:35.760
The thing is I saw him at the bar

23:31.560 --> 23:35.760
paying for his coffee.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.880
He had a wad of notes big enough

23:35.800 --> 23:38.880
to choke a donkey.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.640
Did you ask him about it?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.920
-He said he sold an old car. -But...

23:42.960 --> 23:45.000
He couldn't remember what kind of car it was,

23:45.040 --> 23:47.880
whose name he was registered in

23:45.040 --> 23:47.880
or who he sold it to.

23:47.920 --> 23:51.280
I don't want to believe it, I was so close.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.040
The beggar thief struck in the market again today.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.480
She took a purse.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.440
You got outrun by a little old lady?

23:56.480 --> 23:58.320
No, she disappeared down an alleyway, so...

23:58.360 --> 23:59.920
The shame of it.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.000
Okay, you know what? Maybe next time,

23:59.960 --> 24:02.000
you try and catch her, then.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.040
-Okay, see you later. -Wait, wait. Um...

24:05.080 --> 24:07.360
What are we doing for the Chief's birthday?

24:07.400 --> 24:09.600
I don't think he's keen on surprises.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.320
-We have to do something. -You could run down

24:09.640 --> 24:12.320
and get him a cake.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.040
You think?

24:14.080 --> 24:16.720
No, on second thoughts, wait till

24:14.080 --> 24:16.720
we catch your little old lady.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.040
We'll send her. She'll be quicker.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.280
RICHARD: I'm sorry to interrupt

24:21.480 --> 24:23.280
your break.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.800
BANK MANAGER: You don't want bank coffee, believe me.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.800
Please.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.520
RICHARD: Thank you. WAITRESS:<i> Bonjour.</i>

24:29.640 --> 24:31.680
-Cappuccino, please. -Two.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.120
Water for me, thank you.

24:34.160 --> 24:36.960
When Leon Hamilton put his company

24:34.160 --> 24:36.960
into liquidation

24:37.000 --> 24:38.640
and his creditors were notified,

24:38.680 --> 24:41.320
it was soon clear that none of his

24:38.680 --> 24:41.320
suppliers had been paid,

24:41.360 --> 24:44.040
even though the company accounts

24:41.360 --> 24:44.040
clearly showed they had.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.000
-False accounting. -Yes.

24:46.040 --> 24:49.760
-That's when we called the police.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.400
Close to two million dollars is still unaccounted for.

24:53.440 --> 24:57.280
Our investigators tried to track it down but it was

24:53.440 --> 24:57.280
transferred overseas.

24:57.320 --> 25:01.080
They got as far as Miami and then lost it.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.520
We think it's in Europe somewhere.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.720
So, Paradise Beach was a scam?

25:04.760 --> 25:07.400
Essentially, yes. He raised almost a million

25:07.440 --> 25:10.480
from private investors and then took out

25:07.440 --> 25:10.480
a loan from us for the rest.

25:10.520 --> 25:14.520
-It was secured

25:10.520 --> 25:14.520
against the land,

25:14.560 --> 25:17.880
but it now seems that the land was virtually worthless.

25:17.920 --> 25:21.320
Anything he built on there would have fallen into

25:17.920 --> 25:21.320
the sea within a year.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.280
He'd falsified surveyors' reports.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.040
Were there any, you know, larger investors?

25:27.080 --> 25:29.360
Anyone who took a real hit?

25:29.400 --> 25:32.880
The largest single investor after the bank was

25:29.400 --> 25:32.880
a local businessman,

25:32.920 --> 25:34.480
Gordon Foster.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.600
He attended Leon Hamilton's trial.

25:36.640 --> 25:40.320
Got thrown out for shouting abuse

25:36.640 --> 25:40.320
at the defendant.

25:40.360 --> 25:45.680
-So, he's a man with a grudge. -He lost $300,000.

25:40.360 --> 25:45.680
Wouldn't you be?

25:47.080 --> 25:49.680
I've brought statements from all

25:47.080 --> 25:49.680
the relevant accounts.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.800
-That's Gordon's there. -Well...

25:59.080 --> 26:02.480
Mr Foster, Detective

25:59.080 --> 26:02.480
Inspector Richard Poole.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.440
This is Detective Sergeant Bordey.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.440
May we join you?

26:05.480 --> 26:06.840
Be my guest. How can I help?

26:10.480 --> 26:13.000
We'd like to talk to you about Leon Hamilton.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.680
There's not much to say.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.680
He was a conman and he deserved

26:14.720 --> 26:16.680
everything he got.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.280
Are you saying he deserved to die?

26:19.320 --> 26:21.720
I meant prison.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.120
Although there was a time when I would have

26:23.160 --> 26:25.200
gladly strangled him with my bare hands.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.760
That's a figure of speech.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.840
-Hardly at all.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.960
He was a bit of a recluse. But I had one meeting

26:38.000 --> 26:40.800
to listen to his pitch telling me how much money I

26:38.000 --> 26:40.800
was going to make

26:40.840 --> 26:43.800
and another to sign the contracts.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.000
-No,

26:43.840 --> 26:47.000
I had to fly to Guadeloupe.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.360
He talked about opening an office here

26:47.040 --> 26:50.360
but it never happened.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
Now I know why.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.480
And the next time you saw him was in court?

26:57.240 --> 26:58.920
Too right.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.800
I invested because I run a cleaning firm

27:02.840 --> 27:06.920
and Hamilton promised me the contracts

27:02.840 --> 27:06.920
to Paradise Beach if I did.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.000
Forty people lost their jobs when he went bust

27:09.040 --> 27:11.560
and the bugger very nearly took me down with him.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.760
Luckily, his wife appears to have stood by him.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.160
-His marriage

27:15.800 --> 27:18.160
didn't break up, did it?

27:20.480 --> 27:22.560
-How the hell did you know that...

27:20.480 --> 27:22.560
-You have a tan line.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.320
The divorce came through last week.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.560
Me losing all the money and the stress

27:29.680 --> 27:31.560
of it all, it...

27:33.320 --> 27:34.920
It was the last straw.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.160
Can I ask where you were yesterday?

27:38.760 --> 27:40.600
From 8:30 in the morning until 7:00 at night.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.400
One would suffice.

27:47.680 --> 27:51.000
This is the number of Alice, my PA.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.360
She was with me all day.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.680
RICHARD: Thank you.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.200
RICHARD: Well, he lost a fortune.

28:06.240 --> 28:09.160
Business was clearly threatened and he

28:06.240 --> 28:09.160
lost his wife and son.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.400
Motive enough for me.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.200
Thank you for agreeing to see us.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.360
Well, not sure of what help I can be.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.120
Your husband sailed a yacht around Sainte-Marie,

28:18.400 --> 28:21.120
I understand.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.240
Yes.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.280
A lot?

28:25.440 --> 28:28.240
Uh, I don't know. Yes.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.280
Apparently enough for you to want to cremate him here.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.480
Yes, yes, I mean...

28:33.440 --> 28:35.200
Sorry, how is this important?

28:35.240 --> 28:37.680
Well, I won't know that until I have your answer.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.680
So...

28:37.720 --> 28:40.000
How many times did he come sailing here?

28:37.720 --> 28:40.000
Once

28:40.040 --> 28:41.840
-I said I didn't recall,

28:40.040 --> 28:41.840
didn't I?

28:44.560 --> 28:46.840
I see.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.760
I understand you weren't involved

28:46.880 --> 28:49.760
in the Paradise Beach complex?

28:49.800 --> 28:51.400
Not really.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.720
I mean, of course I knew about it because Leon

28:51.440 --> 28:53.720
would talk about it.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.200
But details...

28:56.240 --> 28:58.080
I'm afraid business isn't my strong point.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.720
So, you wouldn't have any idea where he'd stash two

28:58.120 --> 29:00.720
million dollars, then?

29:02.680 --> 29:04.480
Excuse me?

29:04.520 --> 29:06.760
The amount the bank believe he'd stolen from

29:04.520 --> 29:06.760
the company account.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.600
I would know if we had that sort of money.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.960
And I can assure you we most certainly did not.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.800
Or perhaps he simply didn't tell you about it.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.280
I'm sorry, I think that's enough.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
Huh?

29:25.720 --> 29:31.480
My husband died only yesterday, in your care,

29:25.720 --> 29:31.480
as I understand it.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.160
So I have no intention of sitting here listening to you

29:31.520 --> 29:35.160
sully his memory.

29:36.840 --> 29:40.160
Despite what you may have heard,

29:36.840 --> 29:40.160
my husband was not a conman!

29:40.200 --> 29:42.760
Yes, he may have cut the odd corner.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.760
What businessman doesn't?

29:42.800 --> 29:45.920
But he wanted Paradise Beach to work as much

29:42.800 --> 29:45.920
as everybody else!

29:45.960 --> 29:48.320
He was just unlucky, nothing more!

29:48.360 --> 29:50.360
And whatever his shortcomings,

29:50.400 --> 29:52.800
he certainly didn't deserve to die for them.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.640
-I told you she loved him. -Hmm.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.800
She could just be a very convincing liar.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.160
But she talked with such passion.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.880
Mmm, but passion for her dead husband

30:06.920 --> 30:10.480
or passion not to get caught for being

30:06.920 --> 30:10.480
involved in his murder?

30:14.440 --> 30:15.520
DWAYNE: Uh-huh.

30:15.560 --> 30:19.600
Means, motive and opportunity.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.480
DWAYNE: Could you tell me your name?

30:21.520 --> 30:24.120
Usually difficult to establish, but here we have

30:21.520 --> 30:24.120
them in abundance.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.520
Means.

30:26.560 --> 30:30.600
Common blade, easy enough for anyone to pick up.

30:30.640 --> 30:36.520
Opportunity, despite the fact that he was a prisoner

30:30.640 --> 30:36.520
being transferred,

30:36.560 --> 30:38.840
the boat was crowded, people bumping

30:36.560 --> 30:38.840
into one another.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.560
Simple enough for the killer to find time

30:38.880 --> 30:41.560
for a single blow.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.240
As for motive...

30:46.960 --> 30:48.960
half the island appears to have one.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.600
Okay, I'll send an officer around.

30:52.640 --> 30:56.200
Fidel, you'd better get down to the old market, Cove Lane.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.880
The beggar thief just stole another purse.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.240
Oh!

31:02.320 --> 31:05.600
But the people on the ferry, if they had recognised him,

31:05.640 --> 31:09.640
they may have attacked him, thrown him

31:05.640 --> 31:09.640
overboard, even, but not this.

31:10.960 --> 31:14.640
You're right, had to be premeditated.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.840
Whoever killed Leon Hamilton knew he was going

31:14.680 --> 31:17.840
to be on that ferry.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.440
It was a confined space, nowhere to hide.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.480
If you couldn't afford to be seen,

31:24.760 --> 31:27.480
what would you do?

31:27.520 --> 31:29.600
Pay someone to do it for me.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.200
-Chief.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.880
The man who you interviewed earlier, Samuel King,

31:36.920 --> 31:38.080
is he capable of this, do you think?

31:38.120 --> 31:39.640
At the right price? Hell, yes.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.160
Then as we appear to have hit a dead end,

31:42.200 --> 31:44.160
maybe it's time I spoke to him after all.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.400
Where can I find him?

31:50.560 --> 31:51.560
Mr King?

31:52.840 --> 31:55.440
I'm Detective Inspector Richard Poole.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.560
As you know, this is police officer

31:55.480 --> 31:57.560
Dwayne Myers.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.000
We'd, um, like to ask you a few questions.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.920
I've already spoken to your boy.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.720
Well, now we have some different questions.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.160
Watch him!

32:13.000 --> 32:14.080
Wait!

32:29.960 --> 32:31.240
Coming through!

32:38.520 --> 32:40.200
WOMAN: Watch it!

32:54.120 --> 32:55.280
Mr Foster.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.400
It was a few weeks back, just after my wife left.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.200
I was drunk out of my skull.

33:04.240 --> 33:07.200
I met Samuel King in a bar

33:07.240 --> 33:09.960
and he was boasting about being

33:07.240 --> 33:09.960
a part of the underworld.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.800
A fixer, if you like.

33:13.840 --> 33:18.920
And apparently I asked him how much it would cost to

33:13.840 --> 33:18.920
fix Leon Hamilton.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.760
He said 50 grand.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.520
God, I was drunk! It wasn't

33:24.920 --> 33:27.520
a serious proposition.

33:29.640 --> 33:33.800
Then why were you sitting with him and why did you

33:29.640 --> 33:33.800
run when you saw us?

33:33.840 --> 33:36.000
Yesterday he came around to the house.

33:36.040 --> 33:40.280
He said that he had done it and he demanded payment.

33:40.320 --> 33:43.400
My God, I had no idea he was bloody going to

33:40.320 --> 33:43.400
go through with it.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.400
So you paid him?

33:46.880 --> 33:50.480
I wish. I don't have that kind of money any more.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.960
I just gave him a few hundred to make him go away.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.640
And then he came back for more?

34:00.040 --> 34:04.000
He said that if I didn't come here today

34:00.040 --> 34:04.000
with more money,

34:04.040 --> 34:05.840
then he would go to the police.

34:09.680 --> 34:14.760
So, what would happen if I just got up

34:09.680 --> 34:14.760
and walked out?

34:14.800 --> 34:18.080
We both know that isn't going to happen.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.880
I could always leave a little something behind.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.400
You could say you were distracted.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.120
You know, I really hope you're not suggesting

34:25.160 --> 34:29.320
No.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.520
Just asking a question.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.440
Did you lose him?

34:34.480 --> 34:36.680
No, I got him. He's in the hospital.

34:39.880 --> 34:44.040
No, I didn't, um... I mean, it was his foot, uh...

34:44.080 --> 34:45.880
Samuel King, I'm arresting you

34:45.920 --> 34:48.240
on suspicion of the murder of Leon Hamilton.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.120
He came into the bar wasted.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.360
He started talking about this guy Leon Hamilton,

34:57.400 --> 34:59.960
some bigshot from Guadeloupe who'd ruined his life

35:00.000 --> 35:01.440
and everything he was going to do to him.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.600
So you offered to murder this man for money?

35:03.640 --> 35:05.560
I was only messing.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.960
It was no big deal. I thought I might scam a little

35:05.600 --> 35:08.960
front payment off him.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.240
And then what happened?

35:10.280 --> 35:11.880
Well, nothing.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.560
I'd forgotten all about it

35:13.600 --> 35:15.800
until I'd heard that the same Leon Hamilton

35:13.600 --> 35:15.800
had been murdered

35:15.840 --> 35:18.480
on the very same ferry that I'd been

35:15.840 --> 35:18.480
travelling back on.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.200
It was too good to miss.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.680
So you went to Gordon Foster and told him it was you

35:23.720 --> 35:25.160
in the hope of getting paid?

35:25.200 --> 35:26.200
Yeah.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.320
It was working, too, until you turned up.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.400
VINCENT:<i> Yeah, I think I know</i> <i>the guy you're talking about.</i>

35:35.440 --> 35:37.400
Gold chains, mean-looking guy.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.240
-Yeah, that's him. -Yeah.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.800
Yeah, he would get my vote.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.840
Did Leon Hamilton talk about Sainte-Marie when

35:46.200 --> 35:49.840
he was in prison?

35:50.840 --> 35:52.720
I'm not sure. Why?

35:52.760 --> 35:54.400
Just wondering how often he'd been here.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.600
Is it important?

35:57.640 --> 36:01.080
I think so. Just, you know,

35:57.640 --> 36:01.080
not really sure why.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.640
Sex and money.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.000
All murders are about sex or money.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.720
Um...

36:11.760 --> 36:15.560
Sorry, I don't want to appear rude,

36:11.760 --> 36:15.560
but do you mind?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.720
So, no new developments, then

36:19.440 --> 36:20.440
No.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.000
I could help.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.520
I know the five BRMs off by heart.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.400
-BRMs.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.440
Basic Rules of Murder.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.200
If it's not about sex, it's about money. If it's not about

36:29.480 --> 36:32.200
money, it's about sex.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.400
A wife is always most likely to kill a husband.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.520
A husband is always most likely to kill a wife.

36:36.560 --> 36:41.160
And the last person you should discount should be the one

36:36.560 --> 36:41.160
you least suspect.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.880
I've never heard such claptrap in 23 years of policing.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.280
It's in the November issue of<i> Murder Monthly.</i>

36:47.320 --> 36:49.640
I don't care where it is... Sorry, would you excuse us?

36:49.680 --> 36:51.480
We were having a private conversation.

36:51.520 --> 36:55.560
Very well, but remember,

36:51.520 --> 36:55.560
if you use your BRMs,

36:55.600 --> 36:57.320
you'll never go far wrong.

37:05.200 --> 37:08.800
# Happy birthday to you

37:08.840 --> 37:12.240
# Happy birthday to you

37:12.280 --> 37:16.080
# Happy birthday, dear Richard

37:16.120 --> 37:17.560
# Happy birth... #

37:30.880 --> 37:32.560
I know you're under pressure. We all are.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.640
But would it really be so hard to just once be nice?

37:37.320 --> 37:38.320
I'm sorry.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.200
-Oh. -It was very rude.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.200
Yes, it was.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Is that it?

37:48.720 --> 37:50.600
Good.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.720
Now, not only do the bank statements

37:50.640 --> 37:52.720
show money being drawn out

37:52.760 --> 37:54.680
of the company account over a period of time,

37:54.720 --> 37:56.760
but look, the same thing is happening to

37:54.720 --> 37:56.760
their private account.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.280
You left a bar full of people singing<i> Happy Birthday</i>

37:59.320 --> 38:02.320
just to come here and look at bank statements?

38:02.360 --> 38:04.560
Yes, and I've already apologised.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.560
Can we move on?

38:04.600 --> 38:06.400
You are impossible!

38:06.440 --> 38:12.080
Mrs Hamilton withdrew $50,000 from their joint

38:06.440 --> 38:12.080
account three weeks ago.

38:12.120 --> 38:16.320
Wait, wait, wait... 50,000?

38:16.360 --> 38:19.480
Isn't that what Samuel King asked Gordon Foster to pay?

38:19.520 --> 38:21.480
The exact amount.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.920
Bit of a coincidence, don't you think?

38:22.960 --> 38:23.960
Yeah.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.920
Sex and money. Excuse me?

38:29.600 --> 38:31.200
The mad woman was right.

38:31.240 --> 38:34.160
Great motives for murder.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.760
I think we'll go and see Ann first thing in the morning.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.320
So, are you coming back to the party?

38:40.360 --> 38:43.400
I won't, if you don't mind, um, early night.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.560
A lot to do tomorrow.

38:46.600 --> 38:47.920
I brought you a slice of cake.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.160
Happy birthday.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.360
I thought you'd forgotten all about me.

39:27.760 --> 39:28.800
Morning, sir.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.040
Morning, team.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.480
-Great party, Chief. -Looks like it.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.480
I was just going to call you, sir.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.520
Leon Hamilton is being cremated at

39:35.520 --> 39:38.520
11:30 this morning.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.000
We ran an airline check.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.240
Ann Hamilton has booked the next flight

39:40.040 --> 39:42.240
off the island.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.560
The 14:05 to Miami.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.440
It's her, isn't it

39:46.480 --> 39:48.000
Already on her way to Ann Hamilton's hotel.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.240
Okay, I'll see her there.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.280
Okay.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.000
The beggar thief. You promised to

39:53.680 --> 39:56.000
help me, remember?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.320
That woman I left the party with

40:02.000 --> 40:04.320
last night...

40:04.360 --> 40:05.880
There were two of them.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.320
Oh, so I wasn't seeing double.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.120
That's her, the beggar thief! Stop! Stop!

40:34.920 --> 40:35.920
Phillip?

40:37.360 --> 40:38.480
Wait till I tell your mother.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.080
Police! Police, let me through.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.080
Excuse me.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.760
I think we were on the right trail, you know?

41:16.800 --> 41:19.560
I think somehow she was involved

41:16.800 --> 41:19.560
in her husband's death.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.240
She must have had an accomplice.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.280
CAMILLE: Samuel King is in a cell.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.320
Gordon Foster?

41:28.360 --> 41:30.320
I think if we find out who killed Mrs Hamilton,

41:30.360 --> 41:32.880
we'll also find out who killed her husband.

41:32.920 --> 41:36.160
Only unlike Leon Hamilton, who had queues of people

41:32.920 --> 41:36.160
who wanted him dead,

41:36.200 --> 41:39.160
we just need to work out who profited most

41:39.200 --> 41:40.720
from Mrs Hamilton's death.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.320
Let's get you locked up.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.720
-Yes, sir.

41:49.760 --> 41:52.000
-He's the beggar thief, sir.

41:52.040 --> 41:53.440
But that was a woman.

41:53.480 --> 41:56.320
No, sir, it was Phillip in a dress.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.200
Hmm.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.040
Anything else, sir?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.800
No, no. Thank you, Fidel.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.400
CAMILLE: Thank you.

42:06.440 --> 42:09.080
Okay, they've cordoned off the room. Shall I send

42:06.440 --> 42:09.080
Dwayne and Fidel over?

42:09.120 --> 42:10.360
No.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.160
-That's...

42:12.200 --> 42:13.320
That's what? -If...

42:16.160 --> 42:17.600
Dwayne, where's Vincent?

42:17.640 --> 42:19.280
He was having breakfast at Catherine's bar.

42:19.320 --> 42:20.920
-Yes, sir.

42:20.960 --> 42:22.680
Go and get Gordon Foster. His address is on file.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.160
Keep him here till I call you, you understand?

42:24.200 --> 42:25.800
-Yes, sir. -Repeat it.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.560
Go get Gordon Foster and keep him at the station

42:25.840 --> 42:27.560
until you call me.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.720
Excellent. Now, go on.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.280
-I don't know.

42:30.320 --> 42:31.920
I mean, I think I know.

42:31.960 --> 42:34.800
-That's how it works, usually.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.400
I mean, at least it's the start

42:34.840 --> 42:37.400
of how it works.

42:37.440 --> 42:40.880
You raise a notion, a thought,

42:40.920 --> 42:43.520
a possibility, then you

42:40.920 --> 42:43.520
bombard it with facts,

42:43.560 --> 42:46.600
things already established, tested.

42:46.640 --> 42:50.640
And if that notion, however absurd,

42:46.640 --> 42:50.640
however outlandish,

42:50.680 --> 42:53.200
well, stands up to that kind of scrutiny...

42:53.240 --> 42:59.440
If it still fits and it can't be disproved by what

42:53.240 --> 42:59.440
we already know...

42:59.480 --> 43:02.480
Well, I mean, mostly. Not always, but yeah.

43:02.520 --> 43:05.120
Mostly it's the truth.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.760
Ha!

43:11.720 --> 43:13.400
Bring Samuel King. Come on!

43:17.400 --> 43:20.440
Richard, I was hoping to see you before I went.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.040
Then I'm glad not to disappoint.

43:22.080 --> 43:24.760
-Have a drink. -Uh, no thank you.

43:22.080 --> 43:24.760
Still on duty.

43:24.800 --> 43:28.120
-Good, thank you.

43:28.160 --> 43:30.600
-You missed your own party. -Yes, so I understand.

43:30.640 --> 43:35.000
Still, always next year. Hopefully.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.120
Shall we?

43:36.160 --> 43:37.680
What's going on?

43:37.720 --> 43:40.040
Um, well I hoped we might just run through the case.

43:42.440 --> 43:43.560
Why, indeed?

43:45.720 --> 43:50.280
You see, this case should have been

43:45.720 --> 43:50.280
the easiest I've dealt with.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.240
I was handcuffed to the victim when he was murdered,

43:50.320 --> 43:53.240
after all.

43:53.280 --> 43:55.920
But in reality, it turned out to be

43:53.280 --> 43:55.920
one of the most confusing.

43:57.280 --> 43:59.320
The murder itself wasn't particularly baffling.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.640
Audacious, yes.

44:02.400 --> 44:05.120
Daring, absolutely.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.960
But then, well,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.840
it just takes a second to plunge a blade

44:08.000 --> 44:10.840
into a man's heart.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.960
No, this case has never been about the "how".

44:13.000 --> 44:17.120
It's always been quite literally

44:13.000 --> 44:17.120
about the "who".

44:17.160 --> 44:21.480
Samuel King looked like a good bet to begin with.

44:17.160 --> 44:21.480
Isn't that right, Camille?

44:21.520 --> 44:23.160
Muscle for hire.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.560
A man who claims to be willing to take another man's life

44:25.600 --> 44:27.440
if the price is right.

44:27.480 --> 44:29.160
You were on that ferry.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.280
You could have found that second to plunge a knife

44:29.200 --> 44:31.280
into the victim.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.520
You can't prove nothing.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.200
Quite so.

44:35.240 --> 44:38.480
Luckily, we don't have to "prove nothing"

44:39.600 --> 44:41.920
because you didn't kill Leon Hamilton.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.080
You're an opportunist.

44:45.120 --> 44:46.920
I doubt you had the brains or the audacity

44:46.960 --> 44:48.640
for this particular crime.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.480
You simply saw an opportunity for a payday

44:51.520 --> 44:55.080
from disgruntled investor Gordon Foster,

44:55.120 --> 44:58.160
when he stumbled into your bar by chance.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.720
Hey, look, I really have to go soon.

45:00.760 --> 45:03.360
Not much longer. It'll be worth the wait,

45:00.760 --> 45:03.360
I promise.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.880
You see, the key to this case

45:06.920 --> 45:09.960
was to be found not in the murder

45:06.920 --> 45:09.960
of Leon Hamilton

45:10.000 --> 45:11.800
but in the killing of his wife, Ann.

45:12.680 --> 45:14.480
Fidel, can you come over now?

45:15.360 --> 45:17.320
Yes, please.

45:17.360 --> 45:20.080
Not only do I believe that Ann Hamilton was involved in

45:17.360 --> 45:20.080
the first murder,

45:20.120 --> 45:22.280
I also think she had an accomplice.

45:23.560 --> 45:26.000
An accomplice who did the dirty work, who, uh,

45:26.040 --> 45:28.560
actually carried out the murder for reward.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.360
And what reward!

45:32.400 --> 45:35.000
Not only Mrs Hamilton herself, of course,

45:35.040 --> 45:37.520
but also the $2 million she'd helped her husband hide

45:37.560 --> 45:39.440
from the banks and their creditors.

45:42.200 --> 45:45.400
But a murderer's accomplice is a very

45:42.200 --> 45:45.400
dangerous individual,

45:45.440 --> 45:47.920
particularly when there's money

45:45.440 --> 45:47.920
at the heart of things.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.800
I mean,

45:50.840 --> 45:53.840
once you've crossed that threshold, why not have it

45:50.840 --> 45:53.840
all to yourself?

45:53.880 --> 45:55.000
And that's what you did, wasn't it?

45:56.400 --> 45:57.880
What?

45:57.920 --> 46:00.000
It was you who plunged a blade into that poor man's heart.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.600
RICHARD:<i> The time to strike</i>

46:05.640 --> 46:08.160
<i>was when</i> <i>the ferry hit rough water</i>

46:05.640 --> 46:08.160
<i>as it rounded the point.</i>

46:08.200 --> 46:11.760
A single strike, when you knew that everyone

46:08.200 --> 46:11.760
would be distracted

46:11.800 --> 46:13.640
by having to hold on as the boat rolled.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.280
I think you have a very vivid imagination.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.560
Yes, I have.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.000
Without it, I very much doubt we'd be having

46:19.600 --> 46:22.000
this conversation.

46:25.480 --> 46:29.600
There's an old cliche about murder that someone

46:25.480 --> 46:29.600
reminded me of recently.

46:29.640 --> 46:32.600
That in the vast majority of murders, the motive's

46:29.640 --> 46:32.600
either sex or money.

46:33.680 --> 46:35.000
In this case it was both.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.440
And there's another cliche.

46:39.480 --> 46:41.360
That if the wife is murdered,

46:41.400 --> 46:43.600
it'll usually be the husband who is responsible.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.280
Except this time, it can't be.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.520
On the contrary, Dwayne.

46:50.680 --> 46:51.960
That's exactly what happened.

46:52.600 --> 46:53.640
What's going on?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.800
It can't be.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.560
But you're dead.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.560
RICHARD: Because this isn't Vincent the prison guard,

47:08.600 --> 47:09.840
this is Leon Hamilton.

47:11.960 --> 47:16.120
Mr Foster is the only man in this room who's

47:11.960 --> 47:16.120
actually met him.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.480
Are you sure this is Leon Hamilton?

47:19.520 --> 47:20.520
Absolutely!

47:35.600 --> 47:37.760
While in prison, the real Leon Hamilton

47:37.800 --> 47:41.120
met down-at-heel prison guard Vincent Carter,

47:41.160 --> 47:42.960
recently divorced, broke,

47:43.000 --> 47:44.720
not much of a future to look forward to.

47:45.840 --> 47:47.120
What was the deal?

47:47.160 --> 47:49.520
$50,000 for six months to swap places

47:49.560 --> 47:52.800
and serve out the remainder of your sentence

47:49.560 --> 47:52.800
here on Sainte-Marie.

47:54.280 --> 47:57.840
<i>The $50,000 taken out</i> <i>by your wife two weeks ago.</i>

47:57.880 --> 48:01.080
<i>It was easy enough</i> <i>for the real Vincent</i>

47:57.880 --> 48:01.080
<i>to fake your prison records.</i>

48:01.120 --> 48:02.720
He worked in admissions, didn't he?

48:04.960 --> 48:08.040
<i>So, after you left the prison</i> <i>and before you</i>

48:04.960 --> 48:08.040
<i>reached the ferry,</i>

48:08.080 --> 48:10.920
<i>you swapped clothes</i> <i>with the real Vincent Carter.</i>

48:12.360 --> 48:15.240
You knew all along you were going to kill him, didn't you?

48:15.280 --> 48:18.840
The master stroke was your wife coming from Guadeloupe to

48:15.280 --> 48:18.840
identify the body.

48:18.880 --> 48:19.880
I'm here.

48:21.520 --> 48:25.160
I thought you'd forgotten all about me.

48:25.200 --> 48:29.360
RICHARD:<i> In fact, I think you</i> <i>arranged to meet</i>

48:25.200 --> 48:29.360
<i>her last night.</i>

48:29.400 --> 48:33.760
<i>I think you'd planned</i> <i>how to spend your</i>

48:29.400 --> 48:33.760
<i>ill-gotten gains.</i>

48:33.800 --> 48:36.200
<i>And then she gave you</i> <i>what you needed, didn't she?</i>

48:36.240 --> 48:39.560
<i>Her signature,</i> <i>and with it the money.</i>

48:39.600 --> 48:40.920
<i>No need to waste the night.</i>

48:43.960 --> 48:46.000
<i>In the morning,</i> <i>you threw her to her death.</i>

48:49.560 --> 48:51.440
She also knew that as a keen sailor,

48:51.480 --> 48:53.520
you'd often sailed around the island of Sainte-Marie,

48:53.560 --> 48:56.160
whereas when I asked the real Vincent, he said he'd never

48:53.560 --> 48:56.160
been here before.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.760
And because you were a keen sailor,

48:58.800 --> 49:00.760
you knew how rough the sea got when you rounded the point.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.880
And because the real Vincent wasn't,

49:00.800 --> 49:02.880
he felt seasick

49:02.920 --> 49:04.640
as soon as the journey started.

49:04.680 --> 49:07.120
But although Vincent Carter traded places

49:04.680 --> 49:07.120
with you that day,

49:07.160 --> 49:09.120
he was just a smaller part of the bigger game

49:09.160 --> 49:10.600
you were playing, wasn't he?

49:10.640 --> 49:12.720
Because this was about $2 million

49:12.760 --> 49:16.520
and gaining your freedom, not just from prison,

49:12.760 --> 49:16.520
but also from your wife.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.120
As soon as she'd identified the wrong body,

49:18.160 --> 49:20.160
she was no longer needed.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.520
She thought the two of you were in this together.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.880
She was looking forward to your reunion,

49:24.920 --> 49:28.080
not suspecting for a second that you did all of this

49:28.120 --> 49:29.560
in order to kill her.

49:30.640 --> 49:33.320
It was to be the perfect murder.

49:33.360 --> 49:37.640
After all, how could a dead man

49:33.360 --> 49:37.640
kill his own wife?

49:39.520 --> 49:41.520
Made you look pretty stupid, though,

49:39.520 --> 49:41.520
didn't I?

49:42.280 --> 49:44.320
Yeah, you did.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.240
And please feel free to continue gloating

49:46.280 --> 49:49.440
throughout the entirety of your double life sentence.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.240
Bravo.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.040
Actually, it was Fidel who cracked the case.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.080
-Mmm, absolutely.

50:12.120 --> 50:15.040
Your beggar thief, the old woman that never was.

50:15.080 --> 50:19.880
Without her, or him, as it turned out,

50:15.080 --> 50:19.880
I'd never have made the leap.

50:19.920 --> 50:21.760
That was quite something.

50:21.800 --> 50:22.960
Thank you.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.680
-Cooee! -RICHARD: Oh, Lord.

50:25.720 --> 50:27.840
I see you got someone, then.

50:27.880 --> 50:30.680
So, what was it

50:30.720 --> 50:32.160
Both.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.840
Thought so. BRM, never fails.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.400
You don't want to know.

50:42.880 --> 50:44.920
Well, I think we should celebrate,

50:44.960 --> 50:47.120
as you missed your own birthday party last night.

50:47.160 --> 50:49.280
Cracking idea! Um...

50:49.320 --> 50:51.600
Actually, I'm a little bit tired.

50:49.320 --> 50:51.600
Up all night.

50:51.640 --> 50:53.880
And one or two things to do.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.120
So, why don't I meet you all back here?

50:56.160 --> 50:58.440
Yes, because if you don't, we'll come and find you.

50:58.480 --> 50:59.800
Absolutely. -CATHERINE: We mean it!

50:59.840 --> 51:01.160
-Bye!

51:09.200 --> 51:12.360
Oh, look, he's got his cake.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.600
No! What are you doing?

51:17.320 --> 51:18.920
Okay, go, go! Leave him.

51:21.640 --> 51:23.000
Don't!

51:23.800 --> 51:24.880
Shh! Yeah.

51:31.720 --> 51:32.920
Happy Birthday, sir.

51:37.880 --> 51:38.880
Okay.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.840
Yeah, all right.

51:52.120 --> 51:53.480
CAMILLE: Cheers to the Chief!
