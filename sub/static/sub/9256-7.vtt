00:01.800 --> 00:03.240
Previously on The Shield:

00:03.400 --> 00:06.240
The next 24 hours,
she's your one and only case.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.560
Prostitute. Age 12 to 14.
Had a sweet tooth.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.840
Guy who murdered Sally is out there.
I'm here with my dick in my hand...

00:14.040 --> 00:18.040
...because this guy thought it'd be
funny to rake his buddy over the coals.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.920
You're lucky. Matthew is a charming,
intelligent boy. He also has autism.

00:23.360 --> 00:24.640
Autism?

00:24.840 --> 00:27.000
I don't think I can sell
a cop to these voters.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.880
What would you think of a man
who exposed corruption...

00:30.040 --> 00:32.240
...brought down dirty cops
from inside the department?

00:32.439 --> 00:34.880
I'd think he was committing
professional suicide.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.560
- But could you sell him to the voters?
- Absolutely.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.560
- Bag it.
- Bag it.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.160
- Bag it.
- Bag it.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.680
Bag it.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.320
I wanna know what you found
in the Navigator.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.040
Isn't a stolen-car case
below your radar?

00:52.240 --> 00:53.320
Where are the drugs?

00:53.520 --> 00:56.240
- I saw them pocket the cocaine.
- I told you to let this go.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.720
I may answer to you,
but I also answer to God.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.760
Cops here will treat you like a traitor.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.920
You'll take more shit than ever.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.160
- Are you ready for that kind of heat?
- I'll have to be.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.520
You done already?

02:37.040 --> 02:39.040
I need someone to listen to me.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.200
- I'm busy. Maybe one of the uniforms...
- I said I need someone to listen to me.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.200
Okay.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.680
Did you wanna report a crime?

02:56.120 --> 02:59.600
I've lost track of all the crimes.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.600
- I don't understand...
- I've lived here all my life...

03:03.760 --> 03:06.720
...keeping my complaints
to myself. But no more.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.840
My apartment has been broken into
seven times in the last four years.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.880
Seven times.
And you never catch anyone!

03:14.360 --> 03:19.360
You have got graffiti and cuss words
on every single wall that you see!

03:19.840 --> 03:24.360
I've got needles on my sidewalk,
beer cans on my lawn...

03:24.520 --> 03:28.000
...and I stopped ducking at
the sound of gunshot years ago.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.000
We can drop smart bombs
down chimneys half a world away.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.920
But some sicko gets released from jail
because of a computer screwup...

03:36.040 --> 03:37.840
...and rapes my niece.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.640
How does this make sense?

03:52.600 --> 03:55.120
I see yellow police tape
everywhere that I go.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.480
And it's all sirens and helicopters
and searchlights.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.840
You've got mothers
killing their children...

04:02.000 --> 04:05.840
...children killing strangers, maniacs
flying airplanes into buildings...

04:06.000 --> 04:10.040
...and I just want life to go back
to the way that it should have been.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.399
What are you doing
to make us feel safe?

04:34.160 --> 04:36.520
I love the action, but what
are we doing in Watts?

04:36.680 --> 04:40.400
We got eight people dead.
Nine, if you count the foetus.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.680
- Gang war on steroids.
- Chief doesn't like headlines.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.560
If my ass is on the line,
I want my best man covering me.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.480
Appreciate the compliment...

04:49.800 --> 04:52.880
...but won't Northwest get pissed
with me and Shane on their turf?

04:53.080 --> 04:56.440
- The lead detective is Carlos Zamora.
- Never heard of him.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.040
He's a comer, but he's raw.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.200
Built his reputation working with
gangs. Knows them inside out.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.880
- He know how we work?
- Let him do his thing...

05:04.040 --> 05:07.480
...you do your thing. I don't care,
as long as it gets cracked.

05:07.960 --> 05:13.160
Carlos, Vic Mackey. Shane Vendrell.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.400
- Thanks for helping.
- What gang were they in?

05:15.600 --> 05:18.840
- "Toros". Biggest and baddest here.
- Cameras catch this guy?

05:19.040 --> 05:21.080
Just for show.
VCRs weren't hooked up.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.520
- Who's the mom-to-be?
- Lucy. She was Train's girl.

05:27.720 --> 05:32.360
- Train?
- Train Guttierez. He runs the "Toros".

05:33.240 --> 05:35.600
Well, Train's gonna
wanna retaliate bigtime.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.080
We find who he's targeting,
we find who did this.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.080
I'll talk to Train, make sure
his guys don't do anything stupid.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.160
What makes you think he'll listen?

05:44.320 --> 05:47.600
I used to be a "Toro" back in the day.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.520
I've been able to keep
a pretty good lid on things.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.800
Looks like the lid just got blown off.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.720
The owner said there's
a high-school kid...

06:05.880 --> 06:08.480
...who sweeps up at night.
Wasn't part of the body count.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.960
- Kid call in sick?
- No. He should've been here.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.120
Name is Jaime.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.240
You seeing this?

06:19.400 --> 06:22.560
- Goddamn Oprah Winfrey hour.
- Paging Dr. Phil.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.000
No wonder Gilroy called us up.

06:25.160 --> 06:29.360
A gang war's about to explode and he's
playing grief counsellor to the soldiers.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.000
You gotta let me handle this, Train,
me entiendes?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.280
He's right. We'll handle it.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.800
I'm working this case with Carlos.
Who would wanna start a war with you?

06:40.000 --> 06:44.360
- Things been peaceful, eh.
- Until tonight. So who was it?

06:44.560 --> 06:47.880
- I told you, we've been handling things.
- Right.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.080
- What's that bulge in your jacket?
- Yo, chill, dog.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.760
Come on, man. What? What?

06:58.480 --> 07:00.120
Concealed weapon.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.160
- Suspicious white powder.
- Daily double.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.520
So do I have to search all you guys,
or do I get some answers?

07:08.720 --> 07:14.640
Is it the blacks, Chinese, "Los Mags"?
Who're we talking about?

07:14.840 --> 07:20.320
The blacks. Wet Willie. He's been
making noise since he got paroled.

07:21.080 --> 07:25.560
What do you know?
A clue.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.960
Hey!

07:34.480 --> 07:37.360
Why are you shaking down these guys?
They trust me.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.960
- Yeah. I saw the circle jerk.
- You treat them like people, it works.

07:42.080 --> 07:47.400
So does treating them like the killing,
dealing, thieving scumbags they are.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.320
Mop-up boy went MIA tonight.
See if you can track him down.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.360
- Where you going?
- Talk to Wet Willie.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.720
I can do it. I know where
to find Wet Willie.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.720
Hey, this might be your district,
but it's my world.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.760
Different ZIP code, same pinheads.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.120
Describe what you witnessed then.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.600
Mackey put four bricks of cocaine into
evidence bags, two into weapons bags.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.320
- Then he gave it to Shane, I think.
- You think?

08:16.480 --> 08:20.600
You "think" is not "I'm sure." I called
IAD because you said you were sure.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.680
- Okay.
- This is serious, Julien.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.840
There's no point in doing
the right thing...

08:25.000 --> 08:27.840
...if your testimony is vague.
- I know.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.440
Now, did Mackey give Shane
the cocaine then or did it happen later?

08:31.640 --> 08:33.840
- No, it happened then.
- Then say that.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.840
The statement you give to Frances...

08:36.000 --> 08:38.880
...Mackey's lawyers will twist
it into anything but the truth.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.840
- Do I have to say this in open court?
- Hopefully not.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.640
It won't be good publicity
for Vic or the department.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.920
If it goes the way I've planned,
they'll take a plea.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.080
- They'll lose their jobs?
- Oh, yeah.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.360
Jail?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.040
Julien.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.320
Are you okay living with that?

09:02.240 --> 09:05.240
What's fair for them out there
has to be fair for us in here.

09:16.400 --> 09:20.240
"Facing Autism"? What's up with that?

09:20.400 --> 09:23.520
That's Corrine's book.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.520
A kid in Matthew's class
just got diagnosed.

09:28.680 --> 09:33.680
Oh, man, that's tough.
Family must be devastated, huh?

09:33.840 --> 09:38.320
Yeah. I had this cousin
who was retarded.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.400
Autism isn't the same thing
as being retarded.

09:42.600 --> 09:48.640
What is it, like "Rain Man", freaking out,
counting matchsticks kind of thing?

09:50.720 --> 09:54.760
No. It's not the same thing.

09:55.360 --> 10:00.400
You don't care to educate yourself,
why don't you keep your mouth shut?

10:03.640 --> 10:06.400
Describe what you saw at that point.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.680
Detective Mackey placed four bricks
of cocaine into two evidence bags.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.640
He then took two bricks
and placed it into a weapons bag...

10:12.800 --> 10:15.800
...which he immediately handed
to Detective Vendrell.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.600
- Hey. I thought you were off today.
- I am.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.960
- What are you doing here?
- Taking care of business.

10:22.120 --> 10:26.880
I'm glad I caught you. I've been trying
to figure out how to handle this thing.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.920
- And I had this idea...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

10:30.080 --> 10:34.240
Julien, I'm your training officer.
You owe it to me to at least see if...

10:34.400 --> 10:39.240
No offence, but I'm gonna go
my own way on this.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.240
Okay, here's Wet Willie.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.440
Take his buddy.
Keep him out of my way.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.520
Go.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.200
Wet Willie! Police! Stop!

10:59.680 --> 11:02.120
- I said stop!
- I'll be with you in a minute.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.240
Goddamn it! I said stop!

11:07.560 --> 11:11.200
- You got the medicine?
- Right here.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.760
Now, what do you want?

11:19.920 --> 11:22.200
- What you sweating me for?
- I'm a cop. Slow down.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.760
Slow down. Right here.
Hands behind your head.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.880
- I didn't do nothing.
- Ever?

11:27.040 --> 11:29.720
Or in the last 10 minutes, Kunta Kinte?

11:29.880 --> 11:32.040
Suck my dick.

11:33.760 --> 11:37.120
- What'd you say? Suck your what?
- Screw you.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.560
So you've been
with your sick kid all night?

11:39.720 --> 11:42.760
- He's been throwing up all over me.
- The mom can back you up?

11:43.640 --> 11:49.000
My girlfriend, her sister, her friend,
the nurse at the free clinic. Man, why?

11:50.120 --> 11:51.440
Never mind.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.560
Suck your what? Suck your what?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.560
- Hey. Shane!
- What's going on out there?

11:59.720 --> 12:02.600
- Suck that, you piece of shit.
- Shane! Shane!

12:02.800 --> 12:06.400
- What are you doing?
- Patty, call the police.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.400
- Shane! Let's go!
- Call the police.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.920
- What's going on out there?
- Get the licence plate!

12:15.760 --> 12:17.920
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- No!

12:18.120 --> 12:20.840
We're trying to prevent the war,
not start one, you stupid...

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Goddamn.
The guy was a pain in the ass.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.960
You're being a huge pain in the ass
lately. Should I take a piss on you?

12:29.160 --> 12:32.040
- You're out of control.
- You want me out, say the word.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.440
And don't think I won't!

12:34.840 --> 12:37.120
You've gone over those things
10 times already.

12:37.280 --> 12:42.000
He's a serial killer. Sally won't be
his last victim unless I catch him.

12:42.160 --> 12:46.480
- You're obsessed.
- I'm dedicated. Hey, hey.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.960
Come with me. You're too dedicated.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.400
You need a gimme
to cleanse your palate.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.440
- Low-priority files?
- Pick a card, any card.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.920
What's the point of this?

13:01.080 --> 13:03.640
We take half a day,
we make some citizen happy...

13:04.200 --> 13:07.040
...and go back to your serial-killer
case on a winning streak.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.800
- I don't have time for games.
- You're running in circles.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.120
Now, I've got the cure. So pick a card.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.440
My mother's being
robbed by a psychic.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.720
- A psychic?
- Her name's Frida.

13:25.880 --> 13:29.200
She's bilked my mom and her
friends out of thousands of dollars.

13:29.360 --> 13:34.080
What's the scam? Tainted-money con,
third-party ritual, elixir machine?

13:34.240 --> 13:37.360
She claims to talk to my dead father.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.040
My mom took out a second
mortgage on the house...

13:40.200 --> 13:42.840
...to pay Frida for contacting
the spirit world.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.880
But that's supposed
to be my house someday.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.280
- Well, that is a problem.
- I know. What are you gonna do?

13:56.840 --> 13:59.760
- Any luck with Wet Willie?
- He's not the guy.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.800
We better find out who is before Train
makes a guess and starts shooting.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.440
- Got a line on our missing mop-up boy.
- Yeah?

14:07.600 --> 14:10.360
A gangbanger friend of his called
me and told me where he is.

14:10.680 --> 14:14.320
- A banger just called you up?
- I told you, man, these guys trust me.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.240
Jaime's bragging he saw the shooter
come out of the gun club.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.520
- Great. Where do I find this Jaime?
- I got this one. Wanna back me up?

14:21.680 --> 14:24.600
Just follow my taillights.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.560
You sure you don't want one of these?
You look awfully tense.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.880
I just testified before IAD.

14:32.040 --> 14:36.000
I don't get why you'd complicate
your life by narking out another cop.

14:36.160 --> 14:39.080
Because in my life,
I take personal responsibility.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.880
You might wanna try it sometime.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.720
Ouch.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.760
Skipping out on restaurant bills,
outstanding warrants.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.760
- You don't even have a job.
- I make money here and there.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.800
I'm a cop. I know what
"here and there" means.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.720
If this is what you're like,
I can't be around you.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.240
I really think you could use a beer.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.440
When this housesitting gig ends,
you won't have a place to live.

15:05.640 --> 15:10.000
- Oh, whatever will I do?
- I'm serious. Do you even have a plan?

15:12.280 --> 15:15.440
When was the last time
you even applied for a job?

15:15.640 --> 15:19.360
What's your plan? To keep pretending
you're something you're not?

15:19.960 --> 15:24.080
- It's not that easy.
- I'll try if you'll try.

15:28.280 --> 15:31.760
- Jaime?
- Nah, Jaime left.

15:31.920 --> 15:37.080
Try again, smart-ass.
Finish your drinks somewhere else.

15:38.200 --> 15:42.920
Jaime, we hear you saw
the gun-club shooter tonight.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.840
What colours was he wearing?

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
Stop posing for a picture
and start yapping.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.440
- You saw the shooter, right?
- Maybe.

15:53.640 --> 15:57.600
- What gang was the shooter in?
- You know who the shooter runs with?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.360
No.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.880
You're not blind,
and you only seem half stupid...

16:04.040 --> 16:06.920
...so I bet you got a good guess
who this guy's affiliated with.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.320
Tell us.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.600
- You guys ain't listening.
- What gang was the shooter in?

16:11.920 --> 16:14.800
The white people's gang.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.680
Our shooter is white?

16:17.840 --> 16:19.760
- Early to mid-30s.
- Gringo with a grudge.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.240
- There goes our gang-war theory.
- More headlines the chief won't like.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.960
The Latino community is on edge.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.360
Raoul Jiminez is on his way
to hear our progress.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.400
Jiminez? He run out of janitor
strikes to organize?

16:30.560 --> 16:33.680
What pisses you off more?
That he fights the establishment...

16:33.840 --> 16:36.440
...or that he usually wins?

16:36.600 --> 16:39.120
Thanks for the new partner,
by the way.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.440
- It's a hate crime.
- We don't know what it is yet.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.760
A white man kills eight Latinos, and
you don't know if it's a hate crime?

16:49.160 --> 16:51.360
My people are scared.
What are the police doing?

16:51.560 --> 16:55.920
- We got a drawing of the shooter.
- Even the artist won't vouch for that.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.320
Our witness didn't see much
past the white skin.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.160
Release it to the press. Maybe
someone will recognize him.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.440
It's so vague, every Anglo on the street
is gonna look like a suspect.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.400
- Now you know how we feel every day.
- Please. Save it for the microphones.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.640
I think it's important the public
knows who the enemy is.

17:12.839 --> 17:15.359
It's a waste of time, Ben.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.480
Release the sketch.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.200
Since when do we kowtow
to the "Mexico First" crowd?

17:28.359 --> 17:31.360
If we don't include him,
he'll make our lives hell.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.000
Let him try.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.040
Have you driven around the city
lately? He's the majority now.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.920
- We're still wearing the badges.
- Yeah, for the time being.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.360
How is screwing up an investigation
gonna keep Jiminez off our backs?

17:42.520 --> 17:45.360
I'm counting on you not to screw it up.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.200
Bring in this killer and we keep
our badges another day.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.680
- Hey, no one's taking mine away.
- We're dinosaurs, Vic.

17:51.840 --> 17:56.040
And make no mistake,
the meteor's coming.

17:59.280 --> 17:59.400
Your son says you're being
swindled by this psychic.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.000
Your son says you're being
swindled by this psychic.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.200
Frida's not a psychic,
she's a medium.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.400
She predicted Gene would
go to the police, didn't she?

18:07.560 --> 18:12.560
Yes. She said Gene was waiting for
me to die so he could get my money.

18:12.720 --> 18:16.360
You do know these so-called
psychics are all frauds, right?

18:16.520 --> 18:20.680
Well, most of them are, but not Frida.
She brings me messages from Frank.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.960
- Frank?
- He was my husband. Cancer got him.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.120
How do you think Frank would feel
if you lost the house you lived in...

18:29.280 --> 18:31.240
...to keep paying this medium?

18:31.600 --> 18:35.320
I'd pay anything to talk to Frank.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.360
- Detective Mackey? I'm with...
- IAD. Yeah, I remember.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.720
An investigation has been initiated
into your actions on April 2nd.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.520
Look over these charges and decide
if you'd like a formal interview.

18:47.680 --> 18:52.360
Vic. We got five people shot dead
in a family grocer's, all Latinos.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.680
- This one's in your district.
- I'll have to get back to you.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Here they come. Secure the front.
Don't let anybody else in, okay?

19:08.120 --> 19:11.440
- Officer.
- Detectives.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.840
- What happened?
- Guy came in blasting.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.400
Killed everybody in here
except the owner in back.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.000
He heard the shots, came out with
a baseball bat and ran the shooter off.

19:20.200 --> 19:26.120
- Where's the owner now?
- He's pretty upset. This was his son.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.800
- My boy.
- You were back here?

19:33.160 --> 19:36.760
- Yes.
- And you grabbed the baseball bat?

19:37.640 --> 19:40.480
That baseball bat over there?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.840
Now the shooter, he was white?

19:45.160 --> 19:46.920
What happened after
you chased him out?

19:47.440 --> 19:51.560
- He got away.
- On foot? He didn't get into a car?

19:51.720 --> 19:54.160
- No.
- Well, which way did he run?

19:54.800 --> 19:56.360
I don't remember.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.600
There's blood on this bat.
Did you hit him with it?

19:59.760 --> 20:03.440
I guess. I don't remember.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.920
Our bad guy may have ran away,
but this being L. A...

20:08.080 --> 20:10.160
...I'm guessing he drove here.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.080
Check the plates on these cars. Match
them up and see what stands out.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.000
You want me doing grunt work?

20:16.160 --> 20:18.720
Yeah. Because, A, it's important...

20:18.880 --> 20:22.840
...and B, I don't really feel like
hearing you talk this morning.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.720
I got a 10-square-block
perimeter being roped off.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.280
If he's on foot and bleeding,
we'll get him.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.800
Oh, gee, I wonder what
took them so long.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.840
Can I help you?

20:35.040 --> 20:37.920
We're investigating complaints
about your business practices.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.880
I offer a money-back guarantee
to those who are unhappy.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.840
Very few people request it.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.040
Six hundred dollars for a candle?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.800
Looks like the kind I get
at the 99-cent store.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.760
The candle itself is ordinary.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.520
It's the blessing ceremony
that makes them so valuable.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.520
Blessing ceremony.
What does that entail?

20:55.680 --> 20:58.720
Taking the price tag off,
sticking it on a shelf?

20:58.920 --> 21:02.400
We'd like you to come with us,
answer a few questions.

21:06.960 --> 21:11.240
You yearn for a young woman
who doesn't yearn after you.

21:12.320 --> 21:15.960
What? You see I'm not wearing a ring,
you figure a guy who shops at the...

21:16.160 --> 21:20.120
...99-cent store is single and has the
hots for some woman out of his league.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.320
Is now when I fork over a week's
salary for a candle, or...?

21:23.520 --> 21:28.200
She's someone that you work with
or work close by.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.920
Come on, let's go.

21:33.080 --> 21:37.000
You're wasting your time
with her, you know.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.720
Frances will ask about
the night you stole the truck.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.360
And this'll clean the slate
on all my charges, right?

21:42.560 --> 21:45.600
Right. So long as you tell the truth.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.440
- So how do you want me to do it?
- Do what?

21:48.600 --> 21:51.440
Tell my story. I mean, you're paying,
so you get to pick.

21:51.880 --> 21:56.000
I can be all sweet and innocenty, like:

21:56.160 --> 21:59.160
I don't know what possessed
me to steal the truck that night...

21:59.320 --> 22:04.160
...but when I found those bags of
cocaine inside, I got so scared.

22:04.920 --> 22:09.280
Or I can be all biker-chick,
master-thief girl.

22:09.440 --> 22:13.200
Like: I ripped the Navigator,
was on my way to get it chopped...

22:13.360 --> 22:15.520
...and I stumble across
these two keys of blow.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.720
- How about sincere and honest?
- Not my best one.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.640
- Don't get too cute with her.
- But I am cute.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.920
- Are you involved with anyone?
- Excuse me?

22:29.120 --> 22:31.880
Well, my most recent lover
just died of a drug overdose...

22:32.040 --> 22:38.040
...thanks to high-octane stolen coke,
so I find myself sexually available.

22:39.840 --> 22:46.000
If by involved you mean married with
a baby girl, then the answer is yes.

22:46.160 --> 22:51.640
Damn. Think of the things I could get
away with if I was banging a captain.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.720
Stay out of trouble so I don't
have to see you again.

22:55.920 --> 23:00.480
- Oh, but you wanna see me again.
- No, I don't.

23:02.080 --> 23:07.200
If I was 18 and single,
maybe it'd be a different story.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.720
Oh, I would've chewed you up
and spit you out when you were 18.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.200
I wouldn't be so sure.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.160
The other shop owners
tell the same story.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.320
They heard gunshots,
but didn't see anything.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.840
Nobody looked out and saw
which way this guy went running?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.920
- That's what they say.
- That doesn't pass the smell test.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.520
Vic!

23:35.160 --> 23:38.240
This is the only car whose owner
is unaccounted for.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.320
Check it out.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.000
- Spare ammo.
- Who's the car registered to?

23:46.200 --> 23:51.200
- A George Michael Klassen.
- Nice to meet you, you sick prick.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.840
All clear.

24:17.160 --> 24:20.880
Oh, goddamn it.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.280
As I was going through the truck,
I found...

24:23.440 --> 24:28.000
...some guns and two bags of cocaine.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.120
Okay, let's go back
to stealing the vehicle.

24:32.280 --> 24:35.640
You saw Detective Vendrell
park the truck, get out...

24:35.800 --> 24:38.160
...and go inside the building.
-Yes, ma'am.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.080
And no one went in or out of the truck
between the time...

24:41.240 --> 24:43.280
...he left it and the time you stole it.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.560
No, ma'am.

24:45.720 --> 24:49.320
It's always sad when the people
that you expect to enforce the law...

24:49.480 --> 24:50.800
...break it themselves.

24:52.640 --> 24:57.000
Canvass the place. Find out
if anybody saw a car pulling out.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.400
We found two bodies inside.
They're George's in-laws.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.440
- Oh, my God.
- But his wife and son, they're not here.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.280
We're afraid George might have
taken them with him.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.360
Any idea where your brother
might have gone?

25:08.880 --> 25:10.000
No.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.280
Any place he might feel
comfortable hiding?

25:12.440 --> 25:14.680
- No.
- This is important.

25:14.840 --> 25:17.160
We have to find him before
he does any harm to them.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.160
Well, I can't imagine George
would ever hurt Myra or Brady.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.680
Can you imagine him killing
15 people in cold blood?

25:23.840 --> 25:26.840
Well, that's different.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.760
I mean, you have to understand.

25:30.920 --> 25:35.200
This used to be a nice place to live.
Clean, safe.

25:35.360 --> 25:39.480
George just got fed up being
surrounded by all the spics.

25:39.840 --> 25:42.240
Can you blame him?

25:45.560 --> 25:47.920
Klassen's picture's plastered
all over the news.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.760
He can't step outside without
somebody spotting him.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.040
That doesn't help us save
his wife and boy.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.840
I'm more concerned about what
you're doing to stop the next attack.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.440
Everything we can.
We know who he is. We got his car.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.160
We got units on his family and
friends. We got every base covered.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.600
Waiting around for him to make
his next move isn't gonna cut it.

26:05.760 --> 26:06.840
Where you going?

26:07.000 --> 26:13.120
Hey, as long as he's got it all covered,
I'm gonna go check on something.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.320
Getting a nice tan?

26:31.480 --> 26:34.200
About all I'm good for, I guess.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.960
- You find any blood out here?
- Nope.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.960
So there was blood on the bat
and nowhere else?

26:42.440 --> 26:45.520
There's some blood in the store
unconnected to any of the victims.

26:45.680 --> 26:46.800
Show me.

26:49.040 --> 26:52.200
Shooter loses this much blood and
doesn't drip any on the pavement?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.560
Maybe he went out the back.

26:54.720 --> 26:58.440
- SID check it?
- Beats me.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.280
Looks like somebody did
a nice little sweep job.

27:08.440 --> 27:12.200
Yes, it does. Makes you wonder why.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.360
You know, Houdini wanted desperately
to believe in the paranormal.

27:16.520 --> 27:20.360
Couldn't abide the fakes and frauds.
Spent his life trying to debunk them.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.160
Still held out hope, though.

27:22.480 --> 27:27.640
Before he died, he gave his wife
Beatrice a secret password...

27:27.800 --> 27:30.640
...that he promised her he'd try
to send her from the afterworld...

27:30.800 --> 27:33.600
...so she could tell the difference
between phoneys and the real McCoys.

27:33.760 --> 27:37.240
When he passed away,
Beatrice travelled the globe...

27:37.400 --> 27:42.280
...met with every gypsy, psychic,
tarot-card reader she could find.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.400
Not one of them
ever got the password right.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.520
Houdini should have
had a little more faith.

27:47.680 --> 27:52.000
- Faith?
- On Sundays they call it Christianity.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.720
The afterlife's no different.

27:53.880 --> 27:59.160
Church only takes you for 10 percent.
You've been wringing these ladies dry.

27:59.320 --> 28:03.160
If they refuse to press charges,
you can't touch me.

28:03.320 --> 28:06.080
If I find out you still have your hooks
in these women...

28:06.240 --> 28:08.960
...I'll find other charges to press.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.680
- Fire code violations.
- Parking tickets.

28:11.840 --> 28:17.880
Zoning laws. You name it, I'll find it.
How's your future looking now?

28:18.040 --> 28:19.400
What do you want from me?

28:19.560 --> 28:21.640
It's time to get some new marks, honey.

28:31.440 --> 28:32.880
What the hell is he doing?

28:35.520 --> 28:38.720
- You arrested the shop owners?
- Brought them in for questioning.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.520
- Why?
- Their stories didn't make sense.

28:41.680 --> 28:45.560
Leon's son died four hours ago. How
much sense is he supposed to make?

28:45.720 --> 28:47.480
If he knows something, we need it.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.240
You don't interrogate a grieving father!

28:50.400 --> 28:53.440
And you don't get answers from
people by passing around hugs.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.040
You don't get them
by pissing on people either.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.080
We've got a racist madman
targeting Latinos...

28:59.240 --> 29:01.800
...and you want to interrogate
the victim's family?!

29:01.960 --> 29:05.760
When you trade your megaphone for a
badge, that's when I'll seek your input.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.560
I insist on witnessing the interviews...

29:09.720 --> 29:12.160
...to ensure these men and women
aren't mistreated.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.520
- No.
- Excuse me?

29:14.680 --> 29:16.160
I've included you as a courtesy.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.720
It's time to give my men
the space to do their jobs.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.760
His wife and 10-year-old son
are missing.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.920
- My son's dead.
- You're not telling me the truth, Leon.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.640
- Yes, I am.
- You know something.

29:26.800 --> 29:27.880
No.

29:28.040 --> 29:32.400
If you're lying so you can get to your
son's killer before us to get revenge...

29:32.560 --> 29:36.080
...I can't let that happen.
- I don't know anything.

29:37.440 --> 29:41.040
Then why are you and the other shop
owners all telling the same lie?

29:42.640 --> 29:48.320
And why did someone sweep the path
in the back alley after the shootings?

29:49.840 --> 29:51.560
Leon?

29:51.880 --> 29:54.680
You can tell me.
What did you really see?

29:54.840 --> 29:57.960
"Nada". I didn't see nothing.

30:06.080 --> 30:10.600
I just talked with Frances. You've got
her looking into the Strike Team again?

30:10.840 --> 30:12.920
Yes.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.360
You ever plan on telling me about it?

30:15.520 --> 30:18.360
I didn't wanna bother you with it
until things were more definitive.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.440
I got a problem in this squad, David.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.000
My captain and my best cop
aren't getting along.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.720
We stand for different things.

30:27.240 --> 30:31.560
Well, you better make friends,
or I'm gonna have to make a choice.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.480
And I don't think
you're gonna like that choice.

30:41.160 --> 30:45.240
Maybe you should read this
before you make any choices.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.040
You're gonna need a signature
on this here...

30:49.200 --> 30:52.760
I've been getting some very strong
signals at this desk.

30:53.440 --> 30:57.800
Gee, the desk that
I work at? Spooky.

30:57.960 --> 31:01.560
I'm getting an S name.
Is there a Sarah?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.760
Sorry, no Sarahs.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.760
Or a Sally.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.040
I think there's a Sally.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.080
Do you know who I'm talking about?

31:20.880 --> 31:24.360
You going through my desk?
Reading my file on Sally?

31:24.520 --> 31:25.520
No, I didn't.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.480
Frida! There you are!

31:28.640 --> 31:32.760
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

31:35.440 --> 31:39.240
Yeah. Let's all talk in another room.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.280
Follow me.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.720
She has a message for you.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.760
There's an innocent woman and
an innocent kid in danger out there...

31:54.920 --> 31:58.720
...and you're not telling me the truth!
- Yes, I am!

32:04.160 --> 32:06.760
Someone's holding a gun
to their heads right now...

32:06.920 --> 32:08.760
...and you're stopping me
from finding them.

32:08.920 --> 32:09.920
I'm not.

32:10.080 --> 32:13.280
You might as well be pulling
the trigger. Tell me the truth!

32:13.440 --> 32:16.280
- I am!
- He doesn't know anything.

32:16.440 --> 32:18.600
Yes, he does.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.280
- You gonna pull the trigger on that kid?
- Vic!

32:24.560 --> 32:27.120
What does that make you?

32:28.120 --> 32:30.600
- What if it was your boy?
- My boy's dead.

32:30.760 --> 32:34.320
That's because I couldn't stop the
racist pig from pulling that trigger.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.760
Don't be like the man
who killed your son.

32:36.920 --> 32:41.720
- I'm nothing like him.
- Then show me. Show me.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.960
I heard the shots...

32:50.240 --> 32:52.520
...the shots that killed Favian.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.880
When I came outside, the man
was standing there with his...

32:56.040 --> 33:00.520
With his back to me.
I hit him with a baseball bat.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.640
Knocked him out.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.840
What did you do with him?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.560
My friends heard the noise.
They came over.

33:07.720 --> 33:11.720
They dragged him out the back.
That's why we swept up afterwards.

33:13.320 --> 33:16.320
- What did you do with him?
- He killed my boy.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.240
- I know.
- So I wanted to kill him back.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.480
I know.

33:21.640 --> 33:25.560
I couldn't do it, though.
I didn't have the courage.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.800
So, what did you do with him?

33:29.520 --> 33:33.160
We gave him to the "Toros".
I couldn't kill him...

33:35.040 --> 33:36.640
...but I knew they would.

33:38.320 --> 33:42.320
Oh, shit. The in-laws were killed
after the grocery shootings.

33:42.480 --> 33:46.840
- So Train or his guys killed them.
- They got the wife and kid.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.720
God help you.

33:52.400 --> 33:55.760
Look out! Heads up!

34:00.720 --> 34:02.520
- Where's Train?
- Get him off me!

34:02.680 --> 34:05.320
I can't do that, Lucas.
You went too far. What did you do?

34:05.480 --> 34:08.280
- He had it coming.
- Did the wife and kid have it coming?

34:08.440 --> 34:11.040
- We were making things better.
- We didn't start the killing.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.239
Where's Train keeping his family?

34:14.560 --> 34:16.679
You wanna tell me
with your teeth or without?

34:16.840 --> 34:20.480
He's not gonna let you
beat me down. He's one of us.

34:21.639 --> 34:24.840
Not after what you did. Now, where
do we find this guy's wife and kid?

34:28.239 --> 34:31.480
You didn't see this coming.
You didn't see this.

34:31.639 --> 34:34.440
- Please don't hurt him.
- What? What? You wanna kiss me?

34:34.920 --> 34:37.679
Please, don't.
We'll do anything you want. Just... No.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.280
- Let go. Please. George!
- Don't touch my mom!

34:41.440 --> 34:43.000
Brady! No!

34:47.920 --> 34:51.760
- Train! Don't do this, Train!
- Put it down!

34:53.719 --> 34:56.400
- For Lucy.
- No!

35:05.360 --> 35:07.000
He had to pay.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.440
And who's gonna pay now?
Who's gonna pay?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.800
We all pay, man.

35:15.240 --> 35:20.160
He's gonna pay for the rest of his life.
You don't want to. Trust me.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.040
It's okay. You're all right.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.560
We've gotta get Vic Mack ey
off the streets.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.360
- Have you taken his statement yet?
- No.

35:43.520 --> 35:47.040
- But you have to admit, it looks bad.
- Very bad.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.960
We need to keep this thing
under control.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.400
How can we?

35:54.000 --> 35:57.880
The chief is gonna have a heart attack
when he hears about this.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.400
If the press gets ahold of it...

36:00.560 --> 36:03.120
Goddamn it.
This is the last thing I needed.

36:03.280 --> 36:06.680
I'll talk to my people, make sure
there are no leaks on this end.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.960
Yeah, me too.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.800
Okay. Good.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.560
I just need a few days to figure out
how to handle this.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.520
- What's going to happen to them?
- What do you think?

36:28.680 --> 36:31.160
They handed a man over
to gangbangers to be killed.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.720
They handed over a hatemonger.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.960
Their actions led to three people
being killed.

36:36.120 --> 36:39.320
And a woman being sexually assaulted
in front of her 10-year-old son.

36:39.480 --> 36:42.480
- They couldn't have foreseen that.
- They conspired to kill a man...

36:42.640 --> 36:44.520
...and then tried to cover it up.

36:44.640 --> 36:49.400
They're victims. My group won't let
this department turn them into martyrs.

36:49.560 --> 36:51.920
I thought martyrs
are what brought in the donations...

36:52.080 --> 36:53.880
...and got your name in the papers.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.960
I'll see they don't spend
one day in jail.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.680
They probably won't.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.720
I should get going.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.120
Can I give you a lift?

37:07.280 --> 37:10.200
No, I got one.
Thanks for the offer, though.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.080
Offer's always good.

37:29.520 --> 37:33.160
Sir, do you have a minute?

37:35.080 --> 37:39.520
Sorry. I missed dinner.
What can I do for you?

37:39.840 --> 37:42.960
I don't think that Julien and I are
turning out to be a good match.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.080
- Really?
- I just think he might be better off...

37:45.240 --> 37:48.440
...with a different training officer.
Finnegan's not riding with anyone.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.680
- I could take the next candidate.
- Julien's going through a tough time.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.120
He needs you now more than ever.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.440
You're as good as we have.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.920
You'll work things out.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.480
- How could you do this?
- It was a mistake.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.120
We were gonna use the coke
for an undercover bust.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.840
I didn't do the paperwork.
When it got stolen with the truck...

38:10.000 --> 38:13.120
- Is that what you plan on telling IAD?
- Come on, what do they have?

38:13.280 --> 38:17.040
- A car thief as a witness? Please.
- She's convincing.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.280
Plus, there's the officer who saw you
take the stuff in the first place.

38:20.440 --> 38:25.960
They've established chain of custody.
From you to the truck to the OD victim.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.280
Shane was the one in possession
of the drugs.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.160
- He's the one that got the truck stolen.
- Ben, no!

38:32.320 --> 38:35.560
I don't have the juice anymore
to protect all of you.

38:35.720 --> 38:40.520
Shane had the drugs.
We lay it all on his doorstep.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.760
It's either that or you two
can share a cell.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.800
You don't have to like it,
but it's time to serve him up.

39:02.360 --> 39:05.960
- I was just about to close.
- What was Sally's message?

39:08.880 --> 39:12.000
- She says not to give up.
- I haven't.

39:12.160 --> 39:16.120
She says you're the only one
still fighting for her.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.560
What else did she say?

39:45.880 --> 39:48.480
You have something for me?

39:48.800 --> 39:52.680
An IAD file of a current investigation
my people are trying to cover up.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.800
Dirty cops? Why give it to me?

39:56.640 --> 40:00.160
You'll see it gets the publicity
it deserves.

40:03.280 --> 40:07.360
And if you leak it to the press,
it'd look self-serving.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.440
You want it or not?

40:09.600 --> 40:10.680
Of course.

40:11.560 --> 40:15.760
Don't worry, David. I'll make sure
they spell your name right.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.280
That's my book.

40:26.400 --> 40:31.120
The reason I have it is because
Matthew has autism.

40:31.280 --> 40:34.120
- We found out a few weeks ago.
- Oh, Jesus.

40:36.760 --> 40:42.320
- Oh, Vic. Vic, I'm sorry.
- It's been tough. Lot of work.

40:42.840 --> 40:47.000
You know, the one thing
I've learned is...

40:47.960 --> 40:50.480
...I goddamn love that kid
more now than ever.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.680
Hey, he's got problems, you know...

40:57.800 --> 40:59.600
...but I'm never giving up on him.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.840
I'm not giving up on you either, Shane.

41:19.840 --> 41:23.680
I'm gonna have to get a little creative
on this "past job experience" section.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.680
Creative's cool. Just don't lie.

41:25.840 --> 41:29.280
Though I might need a few glasses
of wine to get that creative.

41:29.440 --> 41:32.200
Let me just skip on down here to the...

41:32.360 --> 41:35.640
What's this? References. References.

41:36.160 --> 41:42.280
It wouldn't hurt to have a glowing one
from a respected city police officer.

41:43.440 --> 41:47.480
- What, you're not gonna help me out?
- I can't.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.480
Unbelievable.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.080
Good enough to suck,
but not good enough to vouch for.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.400
That's not it.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.040
I know. You won't even come out
to my perspective employer.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.160
- What kind of lie is that?
- I can't.

42:00.320 --> 42:05.320
I'm just not ready to tell anyone.
The people in my life... I can't.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.760
- You said you were trying.
- I am.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.880
- No, you're not.
- I am.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.920
Do you know what it takes for me
to keep coming back here?

42:12.040 --> 42:17.440
I mean, I was taught...
I was told to believe things.

42:17.600 --> 42:21.720
In spite of those beliefs, I keep
coming back here night after night...

42:22.000 --> 42:23.680
...because I care about you.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.760
See?

42:29.320 --> 42:31.520
I'm trying.

42:31.720 --> 42:35.320
Just being here is trying.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.600
Police.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.560
Tomas Motyashik?

43:04.760 --> 43:08.240
You have an open warrant
for your arrest.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.440
Let's go.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.240
Don't worry.

43:21.520 --> 43:24.160
Your boyfriend'll lock up.

43:24.640 --> 43:27.160
Won't you, officer?
