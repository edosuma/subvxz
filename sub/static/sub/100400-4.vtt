WEBVTT

00:19.092 --> 00:20.997
Me either.

00:25.601 --> 00:27.228
You know what that means?

00:27.962 --> 00:29.079
It means you're crazy.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.180
Forty...

00:39.017 --> 00:40.753
Right. 47.

00:40.777 --> 00:44.465
47 days until my hearing.

00:46.159 --> 00:47.703
Yep. Officially.

00:47.727 --> 00:49.749
And you'll be my...

00:50.672 --> 00:52.824
how do you sign "sister" again?

00:52.848 --> 00:55.000
Right. Sister.

00:55.024 --> 00:56.760
Can I sleep here, too, Jack?

00:56.784 --> 00:58.008
Sure.

01:24.159 --> 01:25.255
You're going?

01:25.279 --> 01:27.673
Yep.

01:28.896 --> 01:30.919
It was fun.

01:30.943 --> 01:33.456
We've got another hour,
if you want to stay.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.290
And what? Snuggle?

01:35.314 --> 01:37.699
I got a husband already, Jack.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.569
Oof. All right.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.042
Ooh. I'm sweating whiskey.

01:43.066 --> 01:44.920
It's gonna be a rough morning.

02:01.701 --> 02:04.881
You know, I was thinking about
our nutrition at the station.

02:04.905 --> 02:06.129
Our purchases are all over the place.

02:06.153 --> 02:08.497
And Dean is always splurging on red meat.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.607
There's no balance. Hang on.
I-I made you this smoothie.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.655
It's got the exact amount
of protein that you...

02:28.504 --> 02:31.041
Hi. Long time, no houseboat.

02:31.992 --> 02:33.051
What is that?

02:33.075 --> 02:35.777
Ugh. I know. I'm super fat
'cause I'm having a baby.

02:35.801 --> 02:36.897
Hmm.

02:36.921 --> 02:39.040
It's yours, by the way.
Is this an okay time?

02:46.643 --> 02:48.028
Where is she?

02:48.052 --> 02:49.695
With the brass.

02:53.934 --> 02:56.022
"Yes, that was me on the Wheaties box.

02:56.046 --> 02:57.563
Thanks for noticing."

02:57.587 --> 02:59.378
"Boy, you're awfully blond
for a captain."

02:59.402 --> 03:01.417
"I'm tall. And I'm serious.

03:01.441 --> 03:03.871
And I haven't smiled since 1990."

03:04.205 --> 03:05.794
Yeah. Nope.

03:06.894 --> 03:08.118
I'm just gonna say it.

03:08.142 --> 03:10.601
That chick was lieutenant
for, like, five minutes.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.459
She was an Olympian.
Yeah, not a baby chicken.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.699
Well, it's better than an outside hire.

03:14.723 --> 03:17.153
No, it's great. It's great. It's Maya.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.353
We love Maya. We do. We totally do.

03:19.377 --> 03:21.967
But do we love Captain Maya?

03:23.793 --> 03:27.158
- Hey, you okay?
- Uh...

03:27.182 --> 03:31.111
Yeah. You know, I've been better.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.815
For what it's worth, we all
thought the job was yours.

03:38.410 --> 03:40.065
I thought so, too.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.788
Line up in the barn, ASAP.

03:47.204 --> 03:49.804
Thank you.

04:16.594 --> 04:19.226
If I learned anything
from training for the Olympics,

04:19.250 --> 04:23.030
I learned that success isn't
something you chase after.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.566
Success is something you cultivate.

04:24.590 --> 04:28.286
It's grown within.
That's what we train for.

04:28.310 --> 04:31.230
Every moment of every day
should be considered training.

04:31.254 --> 04:33.441
On your days off, at the grocery store,

04:33.465 --> 04:34.625
brushing your teeth.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.193
Every moment can be designed

04:36.217 --> 04:38.423
to make you a better firefighter.

04:39.821 --> 04:43.664
I get it. This is a big change,

04:43.688 --> 04:46.831
and yes, there are going to be
some big changes,

04:46.855 --> 04:50.197
but I am asking for your trust.

04:50.221 --> 04:53.653
I have worked beside you all for years.

04:53.677 --> 04:58.037
I know how this team functions.
I know how to strengthen it.

04:58.061 --> 05:00.223
Our new fire chief is also committed

05:00.247 --> 05:03.130
to creating systems to help us
better serve our communities.

05:03.154 --> 05:04.539
So, starting today,

05:04.563 --> 05:08.123
we will be patrolling
high-risk areas in our aid car.

05:08.147 --> 05:10.843
You want us to patrol? Like cops?

05:10.867 --> 05:12.048
It's a health initiative.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.464
Gibson and Warren,
you're on patrol today.

05:14.488 --> 05:17.843
The rest of you will join me
in a mandatory group workout.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.280
Go, team.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.321
Gym in five, people.

05:26.912 --> 05:30.166
Mandatory group workout? Is she kidding?

05:30.190 --> 05:32.662
Okay, it's a workout.
It's a workout, okay?

05:32.686 --> 05:34.102
We work out every day.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.734
Hey, where's Miller?

05:35.758 --> 05:38.358
Okay, so, after our last hook-up,

05:38.382 --> 05:40.086
I was like, "No more. No more empty sex,"

05:40.110 --> 05:42.006
and I went on this whole,
like, spiritual journey...

05:42.030 --> 05:43.254
you know, reading a lot of Eckhart Tolle

05:43.278 --> 05:44.987
and dealing with my pain body,

05:45.011 --> 05:46.684
really digging into my childhood

05:46.708 --> 05:48.699
and practicing celibacy
and sitting with myself,

05:48.723 --> 05:50.459
for the first time ever, maybe.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.700
And then, while I was
on tour with Beck...

05:52.724 --> 05:55.413
super nice guy, by the way...
I noticed...

05:55.437 --> 05:57.320
well, I took five pregnancy tests

05:57.344 --> 05:58.664
in the Hollywood Bowl greenroom...

05:58.688 --> 05:59.958
which apparently happens all the time...

05:59.982 --> 06:01.800
and I found out I was pregnant,

06:01.824 --> 06:03.688
and you were the only person
I had been with that month

06:03.712 --> 06:05.256
because of the celibacy.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.560
Look, I thought about calling you.

06:06.584 --> 06:08.072
I picked up the phone over and over,

06:08.096 --> 06:11.628
but it just felt... I couldn't, you know?

06:11.652 --> 06:13.196
I just felt like it was my experience.

06:13.220 --> 06:14.403
It was happening to me.

06:14.427 --> 06:16.538
But then I felt it move inside me

06:16.562 --> 06:20.144
like a weird little
sci-fi creature, and...

06:21.448 --> 06:23.148
it's a person.

06:23.172 --> 06:26.284
It's a person who will have
their own spiritual journey

06:26.308 --> 06:29.622
and their own feelings
and favorite album,

06:29.646 --> 06:32.154
no matter how many times
I put "Purple Rain" on repeat.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.326
It's a person,

06:34.350 --> 06:37.839
and that person should have
the right to know their dad.

06:39.174 --> 06:42.503
Can you hand me my phone?
It's just on the counter.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.543
I just can't feel my legs. And I'm late.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.431
I need to call the station, and I just...

06:49.659 --> 06:51.363
I can't feel my legs or my face,

06:51.387 --> 06:52.643
and there's a weird buzzing sound.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.410
- Do you hear that?
- No.

06:54.434 --> 06:56.605
- This is a lot.
- This is a lot.

06:56.630 --> 06:57.715
Yeah.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.904
I can't believe he chose her as captain.

07:05.928 --> 07:07.376
I can't think of a worse leader.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.193
Stalin? Mussolini? Kim Jong-Il.

07:10.217 --> 07:11.920
Well, you wait. She'll put them to shame.

07:11.944 --> 07:14.784
Come on, man. Bishop's good at her job.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.154
She's a little intense, yes,
but she's not a monster.

07:17.178 --> 07:19.553
And she basically stole the job
from her best friend.

07:19.577 --> 07:22.199
No, no, she got promoted.
That's not stealing the job.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.257
Look, Maya is a team of one.

07:24.281 --> 07:25.822
The only back she has is her own.

07:26.910 --> 07:28.609
You sure this isn't about you and Maya?

07:28.999 --> 07:31.397
This has nothing to do with that.

07:32.905 --> 07:34.161
Stop. Stop.

07:42.153 --> 07:43.505
Are you hurt?

07:43.982 --> 07:45.238
You okay?

07:45.262 --> 07:46.838
This is Station 19 aid car.

07:46.862 --> 07:48.598
We have a child,
looks to be about 10 years old,

07:48.622 --> 07:50.038
possibly injured.

07:50.062 --> 07:53.302
Do... Do you need help? Are you okay?

07:53.326 --> 07:55.222
What... I'm not...
I'm not gonna hurt you.

07:55.246 --> 07:57.302
I... Wait.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.821
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hey. I can help, okay?

08:00.845 --> 08:03.307
We can help you.
We're not gonna hurt you.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.776
Wait.

08:23.351 --> 08:27.423
Okay! Push, push, push! Dig into it! Yes!

08:27.424 --> 08:30.024
Again!

08:32.448 --> 08:33.864
It's not physical, it's mental.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.784
You're only thinking you can't, okay?

08:35.808 --> 08:37.576
It's all in your head.

08:39.232 --> 08:41.928
One inch. Just one inch. You got this.

08:49.926 --> 08:51.663
I think I pulled my eyelid muscles.

08:51.687 --> 08:52.654
Can you do that?

08:52.678 --> 08:55.214
Bro, I did way more burpees than you.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.335
Come over here and say that to my face.

08:58.359 --> 09:00.415
You're too far away. I can't get up.

09:00.439 --> 09:03.295
This is BS. She's gonna injure us out.

09:03.319 --> 09:04.349
She was an Olympian.

09:04.373 --> 09:06.334
Yeah, but she...
she won on a sprained ankle.

09:06.358 --> 09:07.294
She's not human.

09:07.318 --> 09:08.670
Yeah, I've seen it before.

09:08.694 --> 09:11.298
Women always overcompensate
to prove something.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.804
Yeah. 'Cause men never overcompensate.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.888
Your stats from your last physical

09:21.912 --> 09:23.554
are written next to each of your names.

09:23.578 --> 09:25.980
We'll be clocking in every week
to see where we're at.

09:26.004 --> 09:29.763
Your body is the most
important tool you have.

09:29.787 --> 09:31.554
Let's get competitive about it.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.158
Okay.

09:37.918 --> 09:39.854
Yeah, I hate her,
but not because she's female.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.361
Herrera?

09:53.385 --> 09:54.912
You look like hell.

09:54.936 --> 09:56.109
Well, feel like hell, too.

09:56.133 --> 09:57.942
Police department
finally give you the boot?

09:57.966 --> 09:59.059
What are you doing here, old man?

09:59.083 --> 10:00.566
Well, I'm here to see you.

10:00.590 --> 10:02.940
Michael, I have metastatic
testicular cancer,

10:02.964 --> 10:05.564
after I was already diagnosed
with mesothelioma.

10:05.588 --> 10:07.345
Huh. What are the odds?

10:07.369 --> 10:08.945
Pretty high, actually, for a firefighter.

10:08.969 --> 10:10.192
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

10:10.216 --> 10:12.433
Well, you'd be even more sorry
to see my medical bills.

10:12.457 --> 10:13.873
Or the hours I spent on the phone

10:13.897 --> 10:15.057
with the insurance companies

10:15.081 --> 10:16.721
trying to get them to cover
my last treatment.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.352
I had to sell the house
I raised my daughter in.

10:19.376 --> 10:21.272
I lied to her,

10:21.296 --> 10:22.552
told her I was just
too comfortable there.

10:22.576 --> 10:23.992
Now I'm gonna die,

10:24.016 --> 10:27.096
and, uh, I have nothing to leave her.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.216
I want workman's comp.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.297
It's... being denied.

10:30.321 --> 10:32.981
Herrera, sincerely,
this is below my pay-grade.

10:33.005 --> 10:34.393
Submit a form or something.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.235
I have submitted all the forms!

10:37.259 --> 10:38.514
They're denying coverage

10:38.538 --> 10:40.275
on my rare form of testicular cancer

10:40.299 --> 10:42.035
because it is sometimes associated

10:42.059 --> 10:43.955
with pesticide exposure,

10:43.979 --> 10:45.715
and I happened to grow up near a farm.

10:45.739 --> 10:47.154
Okay, well, I'm not an expert,

10:47.178 --> 10:48.403
which is why I suggest you talk...

10:48.427 --> 10:50.642
Too many cancers aren't being
covered for guys my age.

10:50.666 --> 10:53.043
We spend our lives
running into burning buildings,

10:53.067 --> 10:57.404
breathing in toxic fumes,
ingesting carcinogens every day,

10:57.448 --> 10:58.864
absorbing them through our skin.

10:58.888 --> 11:00.464
We do it knowingly and willingly.

11:00.488 --> 11:02.544
We do it to save lives.

11:02.568 --> 11:05.899
But when we go down for it,
it should be covered.

11:10.327 --> 11:13.662
I mean... just to play
devil's advocate here,

11:13.686 --> 11:16.702
lots of guys your age
get all sorts of cancers,

11:16.726 --> 11:18.391
and they're not firefighters.

11:18.416 --> 11:19.831
Michael, this is a disgrace.

11:19.855 --> 11:21.591
I gave my life to this job.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.511
I'm not asking for charity.

11:23.535 --> 11:26.072
I'm asking for a change.
My kid is a firefighter.

11:26.096 --> 11:27.629
So is yours.

11:28.912 --> 11:30.808
Michael, if you don't make
this your problem and fix it,

11:30.832 --> 11:34.552
I will start making noise...
that you won't like.

11:37.157 --> 11:38.572
Good to see you, Herrera.

11:38.596 --> 11:41.507
I have a meeting to get to,
if you don't mind.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.515
Thanks for showing up, Miller.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.764
Whoa. What's the matter with you?

11:48.788 --> 11:51.259
Uh, she's pregnant. Very pregnant.

11:51.283 --> 11:52.283
Really, really pregnant.

11:52.307 --> 11:54.491
Uh, super LeBron James, uh, pregnant.

11:54.515 --> 11:56.065
- What's that?
- Who is this?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.155
- JJ.
- Who's that?

11:57.179 --> 11:58.306
Party girl JJ.

11:58.330 --> 12:00.002
- JJ, JJ.
- Oh, JJ!

12:00.026 --> 12:02.018
Oh, J... Oh, JJ.

12:02.042 --> 12:03.623
She's... She's pregnant?

12:03.680 --> 12:05.959
Mm-hmm. And it's mine.
Or she says it's mine.

12:07.501 --> 12:09.973
- Dude, that timing's off.
- No, no, no, no, no.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.565
There was a hook-up,
eight and a half months ago.

12:12.768 --> 12:13.960
- Oh.
- It was a late night.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.689
I was lonely, she texted and came over,

12:15.713 --> 12:18.184
and I checked the date on the text.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.478
It... It... It checks out.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.444
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

12:24.468 --> 12:26.788
Nice work. Miracle of life.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.286
Can't deny it, baby.

12:29.310 --> 12:32.870
So, how... how... What's, um...
How are you feeling?

12:33.408 --> 12:34.631
Mm. I don't...

12:34.655 --> 12:36.039
I don't know.

12:36.063 --> 12:36.968
- Mm.
- Okay.

12:36.992 --> 12:38.088
- I don't know.
- Mm.

12:38.112 --> 12:40.295
I... I...

12:40.319 --> 12:42.663
Why is my weight on that whiteboard?

12:42.688 --> 12:45.021
Dean. Nice of you to join us.

12:45.045 --> 12:46.249
Two hours late.

12:47.007 --> 12:48.701
He's having a baby.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.887
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

12:49.911 --> 12:51.519
We just found out this morning,
so maybe we could...

12:51.543 --> 12:53.375
- Congratulations.
- Hmm.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.551
Since your team member missed
the workout this morning,

12:55.575 --> 12:58.081
we will be doing it together
again as a group.

12:58.112 --> 12:59.017
- No. Come on.
- Wait, what?!

12:59.042 --> 13:00.234
- Sorry, y'all. Sorry.
- No, that's crap.

13:00.258 --> 13:02.191
- Let's go.
- If you're gonna be a dad, Dean,

13:02.216 --> 13:03.932
you need to stay in shape and employed.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.310
Thanks.

13:10.397 --> 13:11.715
Herrera?

13:11.739 --> 13:13.813
I did my 90 minutes today.

13:15.709 --> 13:18.181
Andy, I'm your captain now.

13:20.348 --> 13:25.476
I did my 90 minutes today... Captain.

13:29.245 --> 13:31.169
I'll see you on the floor in five.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.254
Andy, there was a lot to
consider in this decision.

13:49.973 --> 13:51.965
You only get one shot at the job.

13:51.989 --> 13:55.070
One shot to impress. One shot to move up.

13:55.094 --> 13:58.345
I thought you should
take some time to... to...

13:58.370 --> 14:00.970
- process your grief.
- Process my grief?

14:00.994 --> 14:02.251
Copy, sir.

14:03.331 --> 14:04.701
This is not an order.

14:04.726 --> 14:05.973
Understood.

14:07.256 --> 14:09.622
Is that all... sir?

14:13.644 --> 14:16.725
Yes, Lieutenant. That's all.

14:43.173 --> 14:47.156
Cops. Cops!

14:47.181 --> 14:48.725
No, no, no, no. We're... We're not cops.

14:48.749 --> 14:50.645
We're here to help.
Yeah, like hell you are.

14:50.669 --> 14:52.825
I know you. You were here last week.

14:52.850 --> 14:53.882
Took my tent.

14:53.906 --> 14:54.971
No, that... that wasn't us.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.243
Looked like you. Leave us alone.

14:57.267 --> 14:58.491
Look, we have... we have medicine,

14:58.515 --> 14:59.867
we have... we have clean socks...

14:59.891 --> 15:01.275
I said leave us the hell alone!

15:01.299 --> 15:02.518
Okay. Okay.

15:02.543 --> 15:04.087
Hey, look, look, I-I get it, okay?

15:04.111 --> 15:05.831
You work to get yourself together,

15:05.855 --> 15:07.757
to get back into your boots
on your own two feet,

15:07.782 --> 15:09.230
and... and bam, police sweep.

15:09.584 --> 15:11.928
Your boots are gone,
your friends are gone.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.401
You've been taken down to your knees.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.129
Yeah?

15:15.153 --> 15:17.254
- So how come you work for them?
- We don't.

15:17.657 --> 15:19.763
We... We don't even want to be here.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.231
But that cut on your arm
looks pretty bad.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.380
You don't let us treat it
and it gets worse,

15:25.404 --> 15:27.556
we gotta come back here,
pick you up in this rig,

15:27.580 --> 15:30.621
take you to the hospital,
and possibly amputate it.

15:31.357 --> 15:34.917
We don't want that. I know you don't.

15:39.981 --> 15:43.659
So, it's their birthday?

15:45.233 --> 15:46.490
What's that?

15:46.515 --> 15:47.994
Their anniversary.

15:48.018 --> 15:50.097
It's the day they got married.

15:51.442 --> 15:52.769
That's...

15:52.787 --> 15:54.040
_

15:54.040 --> 15:57.520
_

15:57.762 --> 15:58.816
You're weird.

16:06.943 --> 16:09.607
How do we work this thing?

16:09.631 --> 16:10.663
Why do I smell gas?

16:10.687 --> 16:12.231
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Get out of there!

16:12.255 --> 16:14.348
What are you doing?! Get out of there!

16:14.557 --> 16:15.941
What are you doing?

16:16.225 --> 16:17.801
You scared me to death!

16:17.825 --> 16:18.890
Crawling in a hot oven?!

16:18.914 --> 16:20.297
She wasn't crawling in.

16:20.321 --> 16:22.026
We were trying to make
you and Samantha a cake.

16:29.347 --> 16:31.753
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.279
All right? I...

16:34.303 --> 16:37.447
You scared me. That's all.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.947
So... can we stay?

16:43.773 --> 16:45.669
Oh, Jack...

16:47.934 --> 16:49.784
I lost my temper.

16:50.804 --> 16:52.539
Parents do that sometimes,

16:53.054 --> 16:55.456
but you're not going anywhere.

16:57.374 --> 16:58.951
Okay.

16:58.975 --> 17:01.671
I mean, this... This oven's faulty.

17:04.053 --> 17:06.489
We'll buy a cake, okay?

17:06.983 --> 17:10.448
Come on, let's clean this up
together, okay?

17:14.792 --> 17:17.232
All right.

17:17.256 --> 17:18.672
Change this dressing as often as you can.

17:18.695 --> 17:19.782
Thanks.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.872
Hey, whoa! Whoa!

17:22.896 --> 17:24.113
What... What are you doing?

17:24.137 --> 17:25.551
We're just here to get
the photos for the story

17:25.576 --> 17:27.953
about the fire department's
community service initiatives.

17:27.977 --> 17:29.521
Eh, there must be some mistake.

17:29.545 --> 17:30.544
We weren't told anything about that.

17:30.568 --> 17:34.160
You're not from Station 19? Ben Warden?

17:35.621 --> 17:37.116
Uh... Ben Warren.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.594
- Is that with two R's?
- Uh... yes.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.110
- Did you know about this?
- No.

17:42.134 --> 17:44.061
Make sure to get the tents
in a few shots.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.139
Excuse me.

17:48.411 --> 17:51.235
Hey. Hey, w-wait. Wait.

17:56.934 --> 18:00.721
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.673
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

18:02.697 --> 18:05.681
They told me not to get help,
but he's dying.

18:05.705 --> 18:06.737
Who's dying?

18:07.253 --> 18:08.894
My brother.

18:14.142 --> 18:16.903
The goal is to perfect our dexterity.

18:16.927 --> 18:20.104
Extraction is a delicate process.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.325
Too many people
suffer additional injuries

18:22.349 --> 18:23.285
during rescues.

18:23.309 --> 18:25.830
Our rescues should be gentle.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.655
We should strive to do no harm.

18:28.689 --> 18:30.401
I want two people

18:30.426 --> 18:32.089
per hydraulic spreader,

18:32.113 --> 18:34.042
only using your non-dominant hand.

18:34.066 --> 18:35.705
Should we do it blindfolded, too?

18:35.729 --> 18:36.793
That's a great idea, Vasquez.

18:36.817 --> 18:38.521
We should be prepared
for low visibility, too.

18:38.545 --> 18:40.052
We'll do that next. Go!

18:40.077 --> 18:41.282
Yeah, no more jokes.

18:41.306 --> 18:42.761
_

18:42.762 --> 18:44.308
_

18:44.333 --> 18:45.717
_

18:47.444 --> 18:48.700
Come on.

18:48.724 --> 18:50.620
It was just supposed to
happen differently, you know?

18:50.644 --> 18:52.850
Dating, proposal, bachelor party...

18:52.875 --> 18:54.419
- Mm-hmm.
- ...wedding, Greek island hopping...

18:54.443 --> 18:55.827
Whoa. ...then the honeymoon.

18:55.851 --> 18:57.107
Greek island hopping?

18:57.131 --> 18:58.836
Who are you? You James Bond?

18:58.860 --> 19:01.032
There are steps to life.
There is an order.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.049
- And I was planning on that order.
- Oh, come on, man!

19:03.073 --> 19:04.553
See, you got all nervous dad on me.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.025
- That's what happens.
- It's too soon. It's way too soon.

19:06.049 --> 19:09.125
1300 hours. Medical call.

19:09.150 --> 19:11.174
Assist the caller for Engine 19.

19:11.198 --> 19:12.551
- 568 Elkin Lane.
- Oh, thank God.

19:12.575 --> 19:14.598
Sounds like Mr. Lisbon
fell in the shower again.

19:14.622 --> 19:17.414
- Have fun!
- Be safe out there today, Herrera.

19:27.858 --> 19:30.127
Captain Herrera, thanks for coming.

19:31.008 --> 19:32.200
Let me guess.

19:32.225 --> 19:34.673
Dixon gave you a call,
told you to get me in line?

19:35.155 --> 19:37.915
Well, something like that.

19:38.132 --> 19:40.569
He says you're storming
City Hall, issuing threats.

19:40.594 --> 19:42.426
I stormed City Hall to ask an old friend

19:42.450 --> 19:43.354
to be reasonable.

19:43.378 --> 19:44.602
If it got ugly, that's on him.

19:44.626 --> 19:45.855
Sir, our job entails risk.

19:45.882 --> 19:47.106
Don't talk to me about risk.

19:47.130 --> 19:49.474
I was running into fires
when you were in diapers.

19:49.498 --> 19:52.418
Dying with our boots off
more often than on.

19:52.726 --> 19:53.950
Cancer kills more of us than fire,

19:53.974 --> 19:55.358
and I'm not entitled to workman's comp?

19:55.382 --> 19:57.013
You're telling me that's okay?

20:03.333 --> 20:04.895
Respectfully, sir...

20:07.248 --> 20:08.472
...are you sick again?

20:08.496 --> 20:10.584
The whole system makes me sick.

20:10.608 --> 20:11.672
Look, I understand the need for privacy

20:11.696 --> 20:12.952
when it comes to your health,

20:13.212 --> 20:14.756
but if you're sick,
your daughter deserves to know.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.452
My daughter deserves to grieve

20:16.476 --> 20:18.820
for one family member at a time.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.874
Dixon's a former cop. He's not one of us.

20:22.898 --> 20:24.442
Instead of telling me to get in line,

20:24.466 --> 20:26.778
get in line behind me.

20:30.386 --> 20:31.866
Come on.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.679
Sarah, he told us not to get help!

20:37.703 --> 20:39.399
I'm saving his life!

20:39.423 --> 20:40.455
Okay. W-What happened?

20:40.479 --> 20:41.735
He was looking for a place for us to stay

20:41.759 --> 20:42.887
in an old warehouse

20:42.911 --> 20:44.455
'cause I'm always cold, and he fell...

20:44.479 --> 20:46.272
- Through the floor.
- It's my fault.

20:46.297 --> 20:47.841
Yeah, looks like a clavicle fracture.

20:47.865 --> 20:50.017
- What's that mean?
- Broken collarbone.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.585
- What's his name?
- Joey.

20:51.609 --> 20:54.979
Hey, there, Joey.
Can you tell me where it hurts?

20:55.004 --> 20:56.420
Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:56.444 --> 20:57.348
Lay back, lay back, lay back, lay back.

20:57.372 --> 20:58.308
Don't strain yourself.

20:58.332 --> 21:00.036
Now, has he been able to talk?

21:00.060 --> 21:01.540
He was, but then he stopped.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.775
We'll need the C-collar. Yeah.

21:04.799 --> 21:06.727
And we're gonna
need the gurney from the truck.

21:06.751 --> 21:09.863
Joey, we are gonna get you
all checked out.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.730
We just need to get you to a hospital.

21:11.754 --> 21:12.818
No.

21:12.842 --> 21:14.002
See? He said, "No."

21:14.026 --> 21:15.378
No? W-Why no?

21:15.402 --> 21:16.850
- Some of us are bio-siblings...
- Stop! Don't tell them!

21:16.874 --> 21:18.770
...and some of us are foster siblings.

21:18.794 --> 21:20.716
When our foster dad got arrested,

21:20.741 --> 21:22.605
we ran away,
and they were gonna separate us.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.200
- Stop!
- Joey's keeping us together...

21:24.234 --> 21:25.330
Sarah, don't tell them.

21:25.354 --> 21:26.866
...and if he gets
taken away to the hospital...

21:26.890 --> 21:28.402
They're police! They'll take us away!

21:28.426 --> 21:30.674
- We're not police.
- Seattle Police!

21:30.698 --> 21:32.562
This is an illegal encampment!

21:32.875 --> 21:35.027
Everyone collect your belongings

21:35.051 --> 21:36.627
and prepare for immediate relocation!

21:36.651 --> 21:39.475
Clear the area! Let's go!

21:44.595 --> 21:46.618
Let's go!

21:46.642 --> 21:47.707
There's a warrant out for your arrest

21:47.731 --> 21:48.827
for failing to appear in court.

21:48.851 --> 21:49.819
I never seen one.

21:49.843 --> 21:50.747
It was mailed to you.

21:50.771 --> 21:52.667
Where am I gonna get mail?

21:53.145 --> 21:55.073
- You said you weren't cops!
- Hey, what the hell?

21:55.097 --> 21:56.033
These people aren't doing anything.

21:56.057 --> 21:57.313
This is a joint effort here, son.

21:57.337 --> 21:59.393
You don't like it,
go whine to your chief.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.346
Gibson, you can't call me
on my personal phone.

22:14.370 --> 22:16.085
The cops are here.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.332
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing.

22:19.356 --> 22:20.580
Yeah, these people did nothing.

22:20.604 --> 22:22.820
They're disbanding the camps,
by Dixon's orders.

22:22.844 --> 22:24.804
Dixon's using us as bait.

22:24.828 --> 22:27.029
Yeah, we come in and help,
and then the cops,

22:27.054 --> 22:29.654
you know, they just come in
and arrest everyone.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.760
Well, this is outside our purview.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.680
Your own brother might be
out here in this camp.

22:33.704 --> 22:34.960
You're just gonna let this happen?

22:37.704 --> 22:39.248
Don't call me on my personal phone.

22:39.272 --> 22:40.976
You're my lieutenant, I'm your captain.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.055
Use your radio.

22:53.502 --> 22:55.206
Is he gonna be okay?

22:55.230 --> 22:56.326
I'm not sure.

22:56.350 --> 22:58.565
I'm worried about his arm.
Ischemia's getting worse.

22:58.589 --> 22:59.942
What's wrong with his arm?

22:59.966 --> 23:02.726
It's blue. Why is it blue?

23:02.750 --> 23:04.467
Internal bleeding
caused his lung to drop.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.339
Joey? Joey?

23:06.363 --> 23:08.804
Now we have to intubate
and get him to a hospital now.

23:26.668 --> 23:28.085
All right. Tube's in.

23:43.031 --> 23:44.894
Good.

23:54.706 --> 23:55.888
Lila!

23:57.074 --> 23:58.522
Where's Cal?

24:00.113 --> 24:01.434
Cal!

24:03.651 --> 24:05.427
Come on.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.493
Mom! Dad!

24:14.517 --> 24:16.572
Cal!

24:16.596 --> 24:20.060
No! No hospital! You can't take him!

24:20.084 --> 24:23.165
Ernie, he's dying.
You don't know. People die.

24:23.189 --> 24:25.564
My mom died, and they don't come back.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.909
Joey's not responding.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.508
That gives us implied consent
to take him to the hospital.

24:28.532 --> 24:30.778
- That means that...
- I'm the oldest besides Joey.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.899
I'm in charge.

24:31.923 --> 24:33.786
I'm supposed to protect us.
You can't take him.

24:33.810 --> 24:35.194
You are protecting him.
You're doing everything you can.

24:35.218 --> 24:36.795
But we got to save his life, okay?

24:36.819 --> 24:38.427
Joey.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.252
We've called 911.

24:42.276 --> 24:43.942
My parents and my brother
are still inside!

24:43.966 --> 24:46.187
- Help'll be here soon, buddy!
- No! Jack, Jack! No, stop!

24:51.198 --> 24:53.477
No!

25:07.874 --> 25:10.730
Mom! Dad!

25:27.995 --> 25:29.379
Hey!

25:29.403 --> 25:30.980
We got him, Jack. We got him.

25:33.251 --> 25:34.564
No. No.

25:34.588 --> 25:36.132
I can't leave them!

25:36.156 --> 25:38.179
Don't! Jack!

25:46.207 --> 25:47.425
We gotta go.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.233
We have to come, too! We can't leave him!

25:51.257 --> 25:52.320
Guys, I'm sorry.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.857
It's not safe.
You can't drive with us, okay?

25:53.881 --> 25:55.976
But listen, Grey Sloan Memorial

25:56.001 --> 25:58.026
is five blocks that way,
three blocks to the left.

25:58.214 --> 25:59.950
You can meet us there, okay? Follow us.

26:01.765 --> 26:03.790
- Come on!
- Come on, Frankie! Go!

26:09.860 --> 26:11.865
Hi. Excuse me.

26:11.889 --> 26:13.510
Are you here to report an emergency?

26:14.031 --> 26:16.760
Uh, n-no. Not an emergency. I...

26:16.784 --> 26:17.911
Okay, talk to the front desk.

26:17.935 --> 26:19.603
Someone will be able to
help you there, okay?

26:24.334 --> 26:25.484
Lieutenant.

26:27.865 --> 26:29.304
Lieutenant.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.996
Andy, I know this is not what you wanted,

26:34.020 --> 26:35.429
but we are a team.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.013
This team doesn't function

26:37.037 --> 26:38.101
if we are not all in this together.

26:38.125 --> 26:40.597
I know how to be a part of a team.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.489
Oh, hey. How was the call?

26:43.513 --> 26:46.048
Vic. Are we a team?

26:46.072 --> 26:49.505
Yeah. What's going on?

26:51.652 --> 26:52.940
- Travis?
- Hmm?

26:52.964 --> 26:54.668
Are we brothers?

26:54.692 --> 26:56.203
Yep.

26:56.227 --> 26:57.452
I've been waiting all day to see this.

26:57.476 --> 26:59.339
Herrera, this is not
the time or the place to...

26:59.363 --> 27:02.667
Maya is the captain I chose.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.272
Her words and her orders are final.

27:05.296 --> 27:06.519
It's not up for debate.

27:06.543 --> 27:10.103
This is not a trial.
This is a transition.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.795
A large part of your job
is your ability to adapt.

27:13.819 --> 27:16.515
I expect you all
to demonstrate that ability.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.601
Ma'am, can we help you?

27:27.625 --> 27:30.641
Please... I can't...

27:30.665 --> 27:32.648
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:36.747 --> 27:38.644
Still don't feel a pulse.

27:38.668 --> 27:39.939
Hook her up to the LifePak.
Our aid car is out.

27:39.964 --> 27:41.027
We're down an aid car.

27:41.051 --> 27:44.248
Call SFD dispatch and request
the nearest aid car.

27:44.273 --> 27:45.305
All right. On it.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.581
- Hughes, you're on baby duty.
- Yep. Got it.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.327
All right. Hi.

27:49.351 --> 27:50.543
Hi. You're okay.

27:50.567 --> 27:51.951
V-fib.

27:51.975 --> 27:53.807
Clear.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.151
Still no response.

28:00.959 --> 28:02.023
Pushing epi.

28:08.931 --> 28:11.883
Come on, Joey. Stay with me.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.155
Stay with me, Joey. Come on.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.038
Joey, come on. Come on. Stay with me.

28:25.346 --> 28:27.370
23 is here.

28:27.394 --> 28:30.100
I got her name...
Sofia Garcia... and her phone.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.829
We got her back after two rounds of CPR.

28:31.853 --> 28:33.228
And one of epi.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.605
Here's her personal belongings.

28:34.629 --> 28:36.334
Can someone please make the crying stop

28:36.358 --> 28:37.453
before I start crying, too?

28:38.091 --> 28:40.403
I got it. Thank you.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.219
- Did you call the family yet?
- Yeah. I'm on it.

28:48.492 --> 28:50.675
Here we go.

28:50.699 --> 28:52.355
- Here we go, Mami. Go to Daddy.
- Whoa, whoa. Don't...

28:52.379 --> 28:53.811
It's good practice. Go ahead.

28:54.435 --> 28:56.907
Hello. Hughes, you should... What?

28:56.931 --> 28:58.635
- You should take her now.
- No.

28:58.659 --> 29:00.208
- Why? Hughes.
- No. No.

29:00.232 --> 29:02.317
- I-It won't stop. Hughes! Take her!
- No, no. No!

29:02.341 --> 29:03.873
Take her. Take her.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.644
I know you wanted the job, Andy.

29:15.479 --> 29:17.990
It's not that I wanted the job, Maya.

29:19.848 --> 29:21.073
It's that I earned the job

29:21.098 --> 29:22.929
and that I was promised the job,

29:22.954 --> 29:24.498
and that you knew that.

29:24.523 --> 29:28.115
And that... you don't care.

29:43.578 --> 29:45.730
- What do we got?
- Displaced clavicular fracture.

29:45.754 --> 29:47.316
Intubated for agonal breathing.

29:47.341 --> 29:49.205
Concern of limb ischemia and hemothorax.

29:49.229 --> 29:51.317
Needs chest tube immediately
and vascular consult.

29:51.341 --> 29:53.191
Okay, we got it from here.

29:58.693 --> 30:00.173
Is he gonna be okay?

30:00.197 --> 30:01.901
Yeah, I think we got here
just in time, thanks to you.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.181
These doctors here are the best.

30:03.205 --> 30:05.003
- They're gonna take care of him.
- Okay.

30:05.028 --> 30:06.082
Let's go.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.937
Can you talk to your wife, tell her

30:09.961 --> 30:11.345
when she calls Social Services,

30:11.369 --> 30:15.441
just... make sure they know
these kids are a family?

30:16.148 --> 30:17.724
They need to stay together.

30:17.748 --> 30:19.900
Yeah. Of course.

32:36.855 --> 32:40.277
_

32:56.514 --> 32:59.818
Well, my dad literally
never remembered my birthday.

32:59.842 --> 33:02.079
He may still think I'm 12.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.640
I, uh, got caught
skipping Sunday school once,

33:04.664 --> 33:07.553
and my dad gave me the silent treatment

33:07.986 --> 33:09.821
- for an entire year.
- See?

33:09.845 --> 33:11.066
You can't be worse than our dads.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.242
And we turned out excellently.

33:13.266 --> 33:16.378
This really isn't helpful, y'all.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.135
Is that another abandoned baby?

33:18.159 --> 33:19.864
No, parents'll be here soon.

33:19.888 --> 33:22.008
This is baggage from a walk-in.

33:22.032 --> 33:24.503
Very, very, very cute baggage.

33:24.527 --> 33:25.848
Ohh.

33:25.872 --> 33:28.984
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.144
- Mm.
- Hey.

33:31.168 --> 33:33.711
No. I-I can't do this, guys.

33:33.736 --> 33:35.280
- Dada.
- No, I'm not Dada.

33:35.305 --> 33:36.529
I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out.

33:36.553 --> 33:39.313
Oh, actually,
Miller is going to be a dad.

33:39.337 --> 33:40.656
- N-N...
- What?

33:41.186 --> 33:42.832
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:42.856 --> 33:47.542
Do you have any incredibly
unhelpful advice for me?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.559
Um...

33:49.583 --> 33:53.750
My dad was... strict, but kind.

33:54.393 --> 33:56.568
Yeah, just be kind.

33:58.795 --> 34:01.522
This... This just wasn't the plan.

34:01.546 --> 34:03.827
Oh. What... What's that saying?

34:03.851 --> 34:05.874
Life is what happens
when you screw up your plans.

34:05.898 --> 34:07.121
That's not a saying.

34:07.145 --> 34:10.099
- It's not?
- Look, Miller. Miller.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.193
She's here. All right, she's pregnant.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.081
You like her a lot.

34:15.105 --> 34:16.297
You guys had a great time together,

34:16.322 --> 34:17.705
and she's gorgeous and you're gorgeous,

34:17.728 --> 34:18.954
and your genes combined

34:18.978 --> 34:20.458
- will be nothing short of spectacular.
- Mm.

34:20.482 --> 34:21.449
All right?

34:21.473 --> 34:23.005
And you got to skip morning sickness

34:23.030 --> 34:24.286
and nine months of foot rubs

34:24.310 --> 34:26.621
and get right to the fun part
of smelling the baby's head.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.545
So stop taking lemonade

34:28.570 --> 34:30.424
and trying to turn it back into lemons.

34:32.793 --> 34:34.658
Okay.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.790
It just pooped.

34:39.813 --> 34:42.623
You... You... You just pooped.
It just pooped.

34:42.647 --> 34:43.889
- Yeah.
- It's on my leg.

34:43.914 --> 34:45.623
I can feel it. It's feeling it.

34:45.647 --> 34:47.310
- I don't know what to do.
- You're doing great.

34:52.038 --> 34:53.838
Difficult position to be in, isn't it?

34:54.676 --> 34:55.944
Excuse me?

34:55.967 --> 34:57.212
Being captain.

34:57.236 --> 34:58.872
That switch.

34:59.753 --> 35:01.297
You know, one day, you're all friends,

35:01.322 --> 35:02.897
and the next, you're the boss.

35:03.027 --> 35:04.731
It's difficult.

35:04.755 --> 35:05.820
- It is.
- Yeah.

35:05.844 --> 35:06.907
It is difficult.

35:06.931 --> 35:09.049
Seems like a difficult position
to leave, too.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.119
I'm sorry?

35:11.143 --> 35:13.326
Well, you didn't let me handle Andy.

35:13.350 --> 35:16.110
You undermined my authority
in front of my entire team.

35:16.529 --> 35:18.842
To what? Protect her?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.090
That wasn't my intention.

35:20.114 --> 35:21.211
What was your intention?

35:21.235 --> 35:23.418
To give me this job
so you could steamroll me?

35:31.655 --> 35:33.807
My intention was to keep
your team intact,

35:33.831 --> 35:35.375
because in one day,
you've done more damage

35:35.399 --> 35:38.192
to the morale of this company
than I thought possible.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.662
Why did you promote me, sir?

35:43.350 --> 35:46.910
I wanted the job. Jack wanted the job.

35:46.934 --> 35:50.173
But everyone knew it was Andy's.
Why did you give it to me?

35:53.985 --> 35:57.705
Did you think I was the best?
Did I earn it over her?

36:00.545 --> 36:03.336
You know, Captain, I suggest
you learn from my mistakes.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.668
Don't try to fix what isn't broken.

36:08.525 --> 36:10.973
Don't turn your allies into enemies.

36:10.997 --> 36:12.564
And don't question the motives

36:12.588 --> 36:14.176
of the people who put you where you are.

36:16.461 --> 36:17.652
Yes, sir.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.533
I miss working for your dad.

36:50.279 --> 36:52.110
He was a great captain.

36:52.134 --> 36:55.182
The best. Did you get any sleep?

36:56.653 --> 36:58.397
A little.

37:01.589 --> 37:04.156
I hate that Ryan died.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.492
I hate it for the world.

37:06.516 --> 37:09.377
He was a good dude, a good cop.

37:10.292 --> 37:12.252
And I hate it for you.

37:12.672 --> 37:14.749
Thanks.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.988
Me, too.

37:17.444 --> 37:20.268
And I hate that it cost you
your promotion.

37:20.292 --> 37:22.307
Mm. Story of my life.

37:23.725 --> 37:27.821
Men who think they know
what I can and cannot handle.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.262
We saved a woman this shift.

37:32.942 --> 37:34.661
She was having a heart attack.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.530
I was there, pumping her chest,

37:37.554 --> 37:39.706
watching the blood
rush back into her lips,

37:39.730 --> 37:42.363
and I felt nothing.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.499
What is that?

37:45.930 --> 37:48.018
Some days, the job breaks you.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.126
And, you know...

37:50.985 --> 37:55.825
some days, life breaks you.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.596
Sometimes it's too much to feel at all.

38:02.097 --> 38:05.338
Or to feel... any of it.

38:18.071 --> 38:20.543
Hey. I remembered
where you hide your key.

38:20.567 --> 38:22.143
Hope it's okay that I crashed here.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.031
I'm making breakfast chili.

38:24.055 --> 38:29.532
Uh, what... is breakfast chili?

38:29.557 --> 38:31.101
Regular chili,
but I eat it at breakfast time.

38:31.125 --> 38:33.698
Okay. Well, um...

38:33.723 --> 38:36.706
I got a butt-ton of that
praline ice cream that you like.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.624
And I was gonna invite you over later

38:39.648 --> 38:42.760
so we could talk about... LeBron,

38:42.784 --> 38:45.225
but... but here you are.

38:45.249 --> 38:46.633
Here I am.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.905
But the baby likes strawberry,
so now I like strawberry.

38:48.929 --> 38:50.952
Uh...

38:50.976 --> 38:55.688
Well, I guess the baby
got that from this guy.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.538
Is it weird that I want to
eat this ice cream

38:58.562 --> 38:59.913
with that chili on top?

38:59.937 --> 39:01.162
Oh, absolutely.

39:01.186 --> 39:02.857
But I kinda want to see it.

39:03.366 --> 39:04.740
Ooh.

39:07.917 --> 39:09.168
Here.

39:13.601 --> 39:16.840
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.878
Okay, do it again.

39:19.902 --> 39:21.126
I'm not doing it.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.375
The baby's doing it.

39:23.964 --> 39:25.347
Yeah.

39:25.371 --> 39:26.468
Yeah, yeah, it is.

39:26.492 --> 39:28.132
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.861
Wait.

39:45.887 --> 39:47.986
Andy?

39:53.964 --> 39:55.667
Andy, can we talk?

40:13.619 --> 40:16.020
So... what are we doing here?

40:18.288 --> 40:20.183
This is the place I grew up. Well...

40:20.207 --> 40:22.872
...one of them, anyway.

40:22.896 --> 40:24.953
Man, I knew it was bad.

40:24.977 --> 40:26.962
But... this?

40:28.086 --> 40:30.488
- Well, there was a house here.
- Ah.

40:32.081 --> 40:33.625
How old?

40:33.650 --> 40:36.091
Um... 11 till about...

40:36.116 --> 40:38.299
...12 and a half.

40:43.156 --> 40:44.892
Huh.

40:49.543 --> 40:53.680
Yeah, I had parents... brother...

40:53.704 --> 40:56.208
...sister.

41:00.871 --> 41:03.343
Only place that ever felt like home.

41:04.153 --> 41:06.906
And now Dean's starting his own family.

41:09.305 --> 41:10.479
Tired of bouncing around.

41:10.503 --> 41:13.538
I need... I need people.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.641
Mm. I need to move out, too.

41:16.665 --> 41:18.964
I can't live with Maya anymore.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.346
You know, well...

41:23.185 --> 41:24.649
Maybe we look together.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.317
What?

41:28.341 --> 41:29.757
What? You and me? Like roommates?

41:31.221 --> 41:32.637
You sure that's a good idea?

41:32.661 --> 41:34.461
You got a better one?

41:39.873 --> 41:41.865
Okay.

41:41.889 --> 41:45.065
Yeah, screw it.

41:45.089 --> 41:46.345
Let's find a place together.

41:46.369 --> 41:48.105
Not here, though.

41:48.599 --> 41:51.135
I need walls. Maybe a roof.

41:51.159 --> 41:52.575
Mm.

41:52.599 --> 41:54.495
Yeah, I am a firefighter...

41:54.519 --> 41:56.255
...so I can't afford that, okay?

41:56.279 --> 41:58.975
Wow.
