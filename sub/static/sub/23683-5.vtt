WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.629
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.712 --> 00:04.422
This woman was in here
four days ago.

00:04.506 --> 00:08.551
It's just one transfer.
$9,950.

00:08.635 --> 00:11.054
She got off a turnpike
four times on her way there,

00:11.137 --> 00:12.597
and there's a cash place
at each exit.

00:12.681 --> 00:14.808
- So do I bring her in?
- She's not our target.

00:14.891 --> 00:17.435
We've gotta connect her
and the money to Wellington.

00:17.519 --> 00:19.396
- How?
- An operation.

00:19.479 --> 00:20.897
The kind of thing
we used to do in Kabul.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.274
- I'm in.
- The Seroquel, avoid it.

00:23.358 --> 00:25.318
And these are for when
she's too down.

00:25.402 --> 00:27.737
You gotta watch me,
tell me when to medicate.

00:27.821 --> 00:30.281
- What, you won't know yourself?
- No.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.743
Call the medics!
We need help here!

00:35.787 --> 00:37.539
<i>Special Agent
Goodman now a hostage.</i>

00:37.622 --> 00:40.250
You shot a kid,

00:40.333 --> 00:42.001
a 16-year-old boy.

00:42.085 --> 00:44.045
There's a hospital less than
20 minutes from here.

00:44.129 --> 00:45.046
I wanna move him.

00:45.130 --> 00:46.506
You said you'd hand yourself
over

00:46.589 --> 00:48.425
before anyone got hurt,

00:48.508 --> 00:50.385
but you're still here.

00:54.514 --> 00:55.724
There's a news report
about J.J.

00:55.807 --> 00:58.393
- What is this?
- Tell 'em it is not true.

00:58.476 --> 01:00.103
Fucking government.
I knew it.

01:00.186 --> 01:04.816
He's fine! Wounded boy's father
executed the hostage.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.901
FBI Commander ordered
everyone in.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.072
We've been betrayed!

01:11.156 --> 01:13.074
Elizabeth Keane
has broken the truce.

01:13.158 --> 01:16.369
- You have to stop this.
- Too late. Done.

01:37.557 --> 01:39.642
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:39.726 --> 01:41.144
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:41.227 --> 01:45.482
<i>What was his name?</i>

01:45.565 --> 01:49.152
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

01:49.235 --> 01:51.821
<i>You don't have
my condition.</i>

01:51.905 --> 01:54.324
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

01:54.407 --> 01:55.867
<i>since I was 22.</i>

01:57.535 --> 02:01.080
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

02:01.164 --> 02:04.042
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

02:04.125 --> 02:07.712
<i>Civil... War.</i>

02:07.796 --> 02:09.923
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:10.006 --> 02:12.842
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:12.926 --> 02:15.512
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:15.595 --> 02:17.013
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:17.096 --> 02:21.392
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:24.270 --> 02:27.649
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:27.732 --> 02:31.402
<i>We're talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:31.486 --> 02:34.572
<i>Our country
is under attack.</i>

02:35.990 --> 02:39.619
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:40.995 --> 02:44.332
<i>I swore an oath
to protect it.</i>

02:46.668 --> 02:48.628
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

02:48.711 --> 02:54.300
<i>a beacon, steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

02:55.593 --> 02:58.137
Look out! Stay calm!

03:01.432 --> 03:04.060
Killers! You're murderers!

03:09.899 --> 03:12.485
You all right?

03:12.569 --> 03:13.653
Yeah.

03:41.014 --> 03:44.893
19 dead, three of them children.

03:44.976 --> 03:48.271
Well, I tried.

03:48.354 --> 03:52.317
I told you nobody was
listening to me anymore.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.320
Bullshit.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.487
It's all you.

03:56.571 --> 04:00.408
Planting a story,
doctoring up fake accounts,

04:00.491 --> 04:03.995
posting hundreds of tweets.
Right outta your playbook.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.498
I-I don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about.

04:07.582 --> 04:10.627
You turned a clusterfuck
into a goddamn massacre.

04:10.710 --> 04:13.630
Hey, where--where--where do
you think that I've been

04:13.713 --> 04:15.173
for the last two months?

04:15.256 --> 04:18.176
I've been hiding out
in root cellars.

04:18.259 --> 04:21.012
I don't have that kind of
infrastructure anymore.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.599
Not to mention...

04:24.682 --> 04:27.185
Jesus Christ,
I had talked--

04:27.268 --> 04:31.481
I had talked
to that family.

04:31.564 --> 04:32.899
I spent time.

04:41.491 --> 04:42.825
Okay.

04:42.909 --> 04:44.702
If not you, who then?

04:47.789 --> 04:50.500
Sir, David Wellington called.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.335
They need you
back at the White House.

04:55.046 --> 04:57.173
You could've stopped this.

04:58.883 --> 05:01.678
I had you walking out the door.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.190
Anson?

05:14.273 --> 05:17.610
<i>...but stayed heavily involved
in Cuban policy. Then in...</i>

05:17.694 --> 05:19.487
Anson.

05:23.992 --> 05:26.995
- You in here?
- Oh, fuck me.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.748
Get out of my house.

05:30.832 --> 05:34.210
- This isn't a house.
- I swear to fucking God.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.173
You smell bad.

05:39.257 --> 05:41.884
<i>...students marching
in the streets...</i>

05:41.968 --> 05:44.012
- Offer me a beer.
- No.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.323
Donna said
she threw you out.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.075
Why would you call her?

06:06.159 --> 06:07.452
Because you wouldn't
pick up the phone.

06:07.535 --> 06:11.080
What do you think
that means?

06:11.164 --> 06:14.500
You took a sledgehammer
to the family room?

06:16.127 --> 06:18.504
I'm renovating.

06:18.588 --> 06:20.798
What, are you
a marriage counselor now?

06:22.717 --> 06:25.094
How long
you been out of work?

06:28.765 --> 06:33.394
Three months.

06:33.478 --> 06:35.104
Same as everybody.

06:36.314 --> 06:39.484
You okay? Donna says
you're falling apart,

06:39.567 --> 06:42.070
but she says
a lot of things.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.113
Yeah, you know
how Donna used to say

06:44.197 --> 06:46.532
she thought I was
fucking you, but...

06:49.952 --> 06:52.997
That's 'cause
I was fucking you.

07:01.756 --> 07:04.467
I'm putting a team together.
You're first on my list,

07:04.550 --> 07:06.302
so I need to know
if you're really losing it

07:06.385 --> 07:08.429
or just acting out.

07:12.433 --> 07:15.061
Maslin was the ranking
officer on the scene,

07:15.144 --> 07:17.355
authorized to respond
in real time to events

07:17.438 --> 07:19.023
as they unfolded.

07:19.107 --> 07:20.483
When a federal agent
was executed,

07:20.566 --> 07:22.568
he thought the situation
had become too volatile

07:22.652 --> 07:23.736
to continue at arm's length.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.571
I was
three feet away from him.

07:25.655 --> 07:29.242
He was not evaluating
the volatility of the situation.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.994
He lost a man. He overreacted.

07:32.078 --> 07:34.413
Maslin deferred to
the national security advisor

07:34.497 --> 07:37.625
whenever he could, although it
was an unusual command structure

07:37.708 --> 07:39.877
to have in place
in a tactical situation.

07:39.961 --> 07:42.547
Mr. Berenson was there
at the president's request.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.298
That was made clear,
more than once.

07:44.382 --> 07:47.260
Ma'am, I think there's a larger
issue here we're ignoring.

07:47.343 --> 07:49.178
- What's that?
- If Brett O'Keefe wasn't

07:49.262 --> 07:52.348
responsible for the fake news,
and I don't think he was,

07:52.431 --> 07:54.100
we need to consider
the possibility

07:54.183 --> 07:55.685
it originated overseas.

07:55.768 --> 07:58.521
Overseas where?

07:58.604 --> 07:59.939
Usual suspects.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.858
So we're gonna blame
the Russians for this, too.

08:01.941 --> 08:05.945
I'm talking about
information warfare.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.656
Is there actual evidence
of their involvement?

08:08.739 --> 08:11.075
Nothing yet, but I know of
some events in Eastern Europe

08:11.159 --> 08:12.910
that looked remarkably similar.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.125
The FBI shot a kid long before
anyone manipulated the news.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.419
That is on us. We can all

08:21.502 --> 08:23.754
point fingers next week,
it'll be a world of fun,

08:23.838 --> 08:27.800
but this thing is still
metastasizing on the ground.

08:27.884 --> 08:30.344
What exactly is the event
this evening?

08:30.428 --> 08:32.221
A memorial service in Richmond.

08:32.305 --> 08:34.348
We had rioting
for most of the night.

08:34.432 --> 08:38.186
- I'm sure we'll see it again.
- Rioting or demonstrations?

08:38.269 --> 08:40.980
- It's a fine line.
- It certainly is.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.690
After the memorial service,

08:42.773 --> 08:45.484
there's a rally in front
of the state capitol building.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.279
We could be looking at
thousands of people.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.489
And support rallies
in other cities,

08:50.573 --> 08:53.910
- which could escalate.
- What's our crowd control plan?

08:55.745 --> 08:59.498
At this point, we're taking our
cue from local law enforcement.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.380
I like your thinking, Tom.

09:06.464 --> 09:10.509
When there's machine gunfire in
the heart of historic Richmond,

09:10.593 --> 09:13.304
I'll let the country know
we took our cue

09:13.387 --> 09:16.766
from local law enforcement.

09:18.851 --> 09:23.397
We broke it, we bought it.

09:23.481 --> 09:26.776
I want ideas on David's desk
in an hour.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.744
David, hold on a second.
The more I think about it,

09:36.827 --> 09:38.704
the more I'm thinking Russia.

09:38.788 --> 09:41.916
Saul, nobody appreciates

09:41.999 --> 09:44.543
the experience you bring
to the table more than me,

09:44.627 --> 09:45.962
but you heard the president.

09:46.045 --> 09:47.630
Right now, we're trying
to prevent what was

09:47.713 --> 09:50.466
once fondly known as
the Capital of the Confederacy

09:50.549 --> 09:53.261
- from burning to the ground.
- It's what they do, David--

09:53.344 --> 09:56.347
exploit existing divisions
wherever they find them.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.598
I get that.

09:57.682 --> 10:00.643
Just let us deal
with this crisis first.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.104
Then we'll look at
the Russian angle, okay?

10:10.653 --> 10:12.738
I need a plane.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.368
Simone Martin was in Hazelton,
West Virginia, with $50,000

10:17.451 --> 10:19.537
the day before McClendon
died-- that we know.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.580
But was she aware of
what she was doing,

10:21.664 --> 10:24.292
or did David Wellington just
tell her to dead drop the cash?

10:24.375 --> 10:25.751
My guess is the latter.

10:25.835 --> 10:28.212
So we're pretending
to be prison guards.

10:28.296 --> 10:30.923
- Yeah, or their cousins.
- We think 50 grand is bullshit

10:31.007 --> 10:33.551
for killing a general.
We want real money.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.429
- You got a safe house?
- No, we're not kidnapping her.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.180
Shake her up, follow her
upstream to Wellington.

10:38.264 --> 10:40.850
- That's it.
- Then we've tied Wellington
to the murder.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.018
That's all we care about.

10:42.101 --> 10:44.103
Like Peshawar.
The guy in the bath.

10:44.186 --> 10:47.690
- Yeah, or Karachi.
- Before you stole the car.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.609
- I didn't steal the car.
- Who was driving? Me?

10:50.693 --> 10:52.361
Can we not
with the two of you?

10:52.445 --> 10:55.323
Karachi... before
she stole the car.

10:55.406 --> 10:58.200
- Low-vis kit?
- Yeah.

10:58.284 --> 10:59.618
- Who's shopping?
- Me.

10:59.702 --> 11:02.538
- I'm making you a list.
- When's D-Day?

11:02.621 --> 11:05.416
I don't know.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.710
Simone has a late meeting
at her office tonight.

11:07.793 --> 11:11.255
Aside from that, she has
events every night this week.

11:11.339 --> 11:16.302
- Public ones.
- I like her office for this.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.971
Okay. Tonight.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.975
Seems fast to me.

11:23.059 --> 11:25.561
Today? It's a big operation.

11:27.438 --> 11:30.691
- It shouldn't be a problem.
- What if the building
doesn't clear?

11:30.775 --> 11:32.026
I mean, somebody works late.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.944
Then we slip a few days
to the right.

11:34.028 --> 11:36.781
What if she asks who told us
she was the courier?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.574
Punch her in the face.
We don't know who told us.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.285
- Change the subject.
- Don't punch her in the face.

11:41.369 --> 11:45.456
- It's a turn of phrase.
- Don't punch her in the face.

11:45.539 --> 11:49.293
- Fine.
- All right, we gotta get goin'.

11:49.377 --> 11:51.712
Let's write up a Christmas list,
see where we're at.

11:51.796 --> 11:55.633
- Can I open these stroopwafels?
- Open 'em up.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.802
The church where they're
holding the memorial

11:57.885 --> 12:00.429
is right across the street
from the Capitol Building.

12:00.513 --> 12:03.391
So the crowd's gonna
start big and get bigger

12:03.474 --> 12:04.850
once the service lets out.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.395
FBI are sending
SWAT and HRT

12:07.478 --> 12:09.939
to supplement local
and state at the rally.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.274
The church agreed
to metal detectors.

12:12.358 --> 12:15.111
We'll be sure there are
no guns inside,

12:15.194 --> 12:17.988
but we can't do anything
about the crowds out front.

12:18.072 --> 12:19.615
Virginia's an open carry state.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.785
I think we're gonna see a good
bit of firepower on display.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.703
You talk to the governor
about the National Guard?

12:24.787 --> 12:27.665
Yeah, Wyatt's being
a real motherfucker.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.583
Thinking about a Senate run,
doesn't wanna piss off

12:29.667 --> 12:31.836
- a crowd of white, rural voters.
- Yeah.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.671
Now you can federalize
the Guard,

12:33.754 --> 12:36.298
but the optics on that are
pretty brutal right now.

12:36.382 --> 12:39.844
Could just exacerbate
the mood on the streets.

12:44.223 --> 12:47.351
Why are there 14 names
on this list?

12:47.435 --> 12:49.687
The people they're honoring
at the service today.

12:49.770 --> 12:53.107
It's the dead
from the compound.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.151
19 people died.

12:55.234 --> 12:57.027
The other five are FBI.

12:57.111 --> 13:00.573
They're still dead,
aren't they?

13:00.656 --> 13:04.994
The event was organized
by families from Lucasville.

13:05.077 --> 13:07.371
Well...

13:07.455 --> 13:12.751
it's not just theirs
anymore, is it?

13:38.402 --> 13:40.821
<i>West of
the perimeter is cleared.</i>

13:47.536 --> 13:52.249
President Keane,
this is Jackie Goodman.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.959
I am...

13:54.043 --> 13:55.753
so sorry for your loss.

13:55.836 --> 13:59.089
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.884
Can I?

14:04.470 --> 14:06.055
Oh.

14:08.057 --> 14:10.267
What a terrible thing.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.855
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

14:14.939 --> 14:17.358
You're gonna have
to stop thanking me.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.109
I'm sure I've turned
your home upside down.

14:19.193 --> 14:22.071
- I am not an easy guest.
- Oh, it's good.

14:22.154 --> 14:25.366
You got my sisters out of here
for an hour, so...

14:25.449 --> 14:29.411
Oh. Please, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.043
Can I offer you something?

14:36.126 --> 14:38.045
You didn't have
to do all this.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.380
I didn't.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.798
I don't...

14:40.881 --> 14:43.384
I don't even remember
who did, frankly.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.726
You got a lot of family around?
People who can help?

14:52.810 --> 14:56.772
Yeah. Two sisters,
a brother, Ryan's dad.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.441
How long have
you been an agent?

14:59.525 --> 15:01.277
Eight years.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.530
Ryan and I met
at the Academy.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.953
We're gonna see
each other again.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.330
There's a Medal of Valor
I'm gonna present to you

15:13.414 --> 15:15.541
in a few months
in Ryan's honor.

15:15.624 --> 15:19.378
And I'll repeat all of this
because this week

15:19.461 --> 15:23.257
will be nothing but a blur,
but I want you to know

15:23.340 --> 15:28.053
your husband is a credit to
the Bureau and to this nation.

15:28.137 --> 15:32.474
He was exactly what we hope
our officers will be.

15:36.604 --> 15:39.315
Thank you.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.734
Thank you.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.780
I have
to ask you something.

15:46.864 --> 15:51.285
And it is a difficult thing
to ask, but I honestly think

15:51.368 --> 15:54.371
that lives are at stake,
so I am gonna do it anyway.

15:54.455 --> 15:55.873
Okay.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.917
I would like you to attend
the memorial service tonight.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.003
It's for victims
of the massacre.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.714
And whether or not anyone from
Lucasville sees it that way,

16:03.797 --> 16:06.342
your husband and four other
federal agents

16:06.425 --> 16:09.928
are victims
of that massacre.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.183
I'm-- I... I didn't
see that coming. I...

16:14.266 --> 16:16.352
I know. I know.

16:16.435 --> 16:19.438
But this thing keeps
getting worse.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.023
I'm worried about people
killing each other

16:21.106 --> 16:22.691
in the streets tonight.

16:22.775 --> 16:27.738
I-I don't think that me walking
into that church calms anything.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.907
- It might.
- A thousand white separatists

16:29.990 --> 16:31.492
who just lost 15
of their own...

16:31.575 --> 16:34.828
They will have undercover FBI
there to protect you,

16:34.912 --> 16:37.039
but it will be
a difficult place to be.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.333
There is no question.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.543
I'm gonna ask
the other widows as well,

16:41.627 --> 16:44.254
but I wanted to come to you
first because I think

16:44.338 --> 16:46.965
you're the one who will
mean the most.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.051
Because I'm FBI

16:49.134 --> 16:52.137
or because they shot
my husband in the head?

16:55.516 --> 16:58.394
If I tell the American people
we need to stop behaving

16:58.477 --> 17:01.689
like animals,
I am a schoolmarm

17:01.772 --> 17:04.733
or a fascist
and a hypocrite.

17:04.817 --> 17:06.985
I am a lot of things,
none of them useful.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.113
You walk in there--

17:09.196 --> 17:10.989
Picture of restraint.

17:13.826 --> 17:17.621
God knows I never thought
my presidency would be about

17:17.705 --> 17:20.374
telling another woman
to bite her tongue

17:20.457 --> 17:24.378
and turn the other cheek--
any woman, never mind...

17:29.299 --> 17:31.135
But here we are.

18:07.546 --> 18:10.174
Mr. National Security Advisor.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.801
Ivan. Not bad.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.261
We buy this for you?

18:14.344 --> 18:16.472
You certainly helped.

18:16.555 --> 18:19.641
Thank you.
You're a generous people.

18:19.725 --> 18:23.645
Wanna introduce you
to a friend.

18:23.729 --> 18:26.982
This is Kira.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.400
Kira, Saul Berenson.

18:28.484 --> 18:32.196
Hi. Sorry, my hands are gross.
Nice to meet you.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.114
- Sorry for interrupting.
- Not at all.

18:34.198 --> 18:36.992
- Hope you're hungry.
- Thank you,
but I can't stay long.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.911
- Just passing through.
- Leave it on.

18:38.994 --> 18:43.165
Kirashka, we're gonna take
a walk up to the lookout, okay?

18:48.712 --> 18:50.798
I'm glad to see
you're settling in.

18:50.881 --> 18:53.634
Mm, I have. Thank you.

18:53.717 --> 18:56.261
How about you?
Still divorced?

18:56.345 --> 18:58.096
Didn't go crawling back
to your wife

18:58.180 --> 19:00.849
after all the trouble
in Berlin?

19:00.933 --> 19:03.852
Fuck off.

19:03.936 --> 19:06.772
Talk to me about Slovyansk.
2014.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.106
What about it?

19:08.190 --> 19:11.735
Russian state TV reports
Ukrainian soldiers

19:11.819 --> 19:13.946
crucified a boy
in the town square.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.739
Yeah.

19:15.823 --> 19:17.991
Nailed him to a board
for the alleged crimes

19:18.075 --> 19:19.535
of his separatist parents.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.663
That was bullshit.
Never happened.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.415
Of course not.
Directorate Six made it up.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.501
You see the story
about J.J. Elkins

19:27.584 --> 19:29.753
dying unattended
in the hospital?

19:29.837 --> 19:32.381
Virginia?

19:32.464 --> 19:33.715
One couldn't help notice

19:33.799 --> 19:37.010
a similar
operational signature.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.514
You think it was us?

19:40.597 --> 19:42.307
Fake death of one boy
stirred up enough

19:42.391 --> 19:45.769
anti-Ukrainian sentiment in
Russia to justify an invasion.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.896
Fake death of the other
sparked a massacre

19:47.980 --> 19:50.315
that might topple
the presidency.

19:53.110 --> 19:54.570
Yeah. Sure.

19:54.653 --> 19:58.448
But... two events,
years apart.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.701
No, you give us
a lot of credit.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.620
Par for
the fucking course.

20:03.704 --> 20:06.957
I read your debrief
on active measures.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.085
If anything, you ran up
enough efforts

20:10.168 --> 20:13.297
to undermine democracies
all over the world.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.966
Yeah, this was different.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.594
- How so?
- It's too dangerous

20:18.677 --> 20:19.970
and too soon
after we were caught

20:20.053 --> 20:22.723
with our hands
in your elections.

20:35.986 --> 20:38.488
The one on the end.

20:38.572 --> 20:41.700
Gotta be a whole lot nicer
than the Budapest office.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.080
Did she move here
because of Wellington,

20:47.164 --> 20:50.208
- or was it just good timing?
- I don't know.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.597
Bryan Harris.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.724
Director of
Government Relations.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.656
We have plenty of time.

21:20.739 --> 21:23.992
If we're not ready by the end
of the day, we'll hold off.

21:24.076 --> 21:26.453
I'm not worried.

21:26.536 --> 21:30.082
- Do I look nervous?
- A little bit.

21:33.085 --> 21:36.088
I guess it's been a while since
I've been on an op like this.

21:38.507 --> 21:39.841
You miss it?

21:39.925 --> 21:42.344
Are you kidding?

21:42.427 --> 21:45.055
All the time.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.807
That was real work.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.935
I mean, this is important.
I know that. But...

21:53.105 --> 21:55.565
Nobody grows up dreaming
of taking down criminals

21:55.649 --> 21:57.776
inside their own government.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.503
What do you know about
Yevgeny Gromov?

22:19.464 --> 22:21.341
Yevgeny Gromov.

22:21.425 --> 22:26.430
Well, Gromov was responsible
for that crucifixion story.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.390
I suppose you knew that.

22:28.473 --> 22:32.394
Uh, creative thinker, yeah.

22:32.477 --> 22:35.063
Made an impression
at Directorate Six.

22:35.147 --> 22:37.315
Nobody's seen him
in a couple of years.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.234
May not have lasted.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.903
Yevgeny was a self-promoter.

22:41.987 --> 22:44.948
You don't think the Kremlin
tucked him away somewhere?

22:45.032 --> 22:47.617
With a budget
and a lot of cover?

22:47.701 --> 22:50.579
People say it laid
the groundwork for Brexit.

22:50.662 --> 22:51.788
More or less rethought

22:51.872 --> 22:54.750
active measures
for the Facebook generation.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.460
It's quite a résumé.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.296
You don't buy it?

22:59.379 --> 23:02.632
- One guy? No.
- Well, maybe he's turned

23:02.716 --> 23:05.427
his considerable skills
against the United States.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.292
Know what it's called?

23:37.375 --> 23:39.419
- This?
- Mm-hmm.

23:39.503 --> 23:42.255
Snake River.

23:42.339 --> 23:45.342
- You know why?
- No.

23:48.136 --> 23:52.599
Indians were trying to
communicate with your explorers.

23:52.682 --> 23:57.562
Showed them the river,
made like this with the hand.

23:57.646 --> 24:00.315
Your people thought
it meant "snakes."

24:00.398 --> 24:02.484
Hmm.

24:02.567 --> 24:04.820
What'd it mean?

24:04.903 --> 24:06.404
Fish.

24:09.032 --> 24:15.413
Sometimes, a domestic crisis
is just a domestic crisis.

24:38.603 --> 24:41.189
Karen Motskin. Out.

24:41.273 --> 24:44.442
- Copy.
- Did I already take one of these?

24:44.526 --> 24:47.237
- What is it?
- M.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.406
No. You took one at lunch
in the car.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.741
- Nothing since then?
- Um...

24:51.825 --> 24:54.828
I don't wanna zone out, but if
I double up, I'll get jittery.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.956
1:40 p.m. Ten milligrams.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.835
You asked me to keep track.

25:01.918 --> 25:04.671
I did.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.674
Five milligrams. 8:17.

25:11.094 --> 25:14.097
- Shut up.
- I took a Zyrtec at 1:00.

25:14.181 --> 25:18.268
- Hay fever.
<i>- Got eyes on the target.</i>

25:18.351 --> 25:22.272
She's packing up.

25:25.108 --> 25:26.568
And... we're on.

25:26.651 --> 25:28.278
Copy.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.906
- Anson?
- Yeah, we're good to go.

25:41.541 --> 25:44.127
What'd you do
to her car, man?

25:44.211 --> 25:46.588
<i>Disabled the ignition.</i>

26:01.937 --> 26:04.898
- Roadside Assistance.
<i>- My car won't start.</i>

26:04.981 --> 26:07.275
<i>Uh, I think it is the battery.
It's not smoking,</i>

26:07.359 --> 26:10.570
<i>- so it's just dead.</i>
- What's your location?

26:10.654 --> 26:14.574
<i>I'm just in front
of 17401 Corcoran Street</i>

26:14.658 --> 26:16.284
<i>in the District.</i>

26:16.368 --> 26:20.538
I can get a truck to you
in about... 35, 40 minutes.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.041
<i>- Nothing sooner?</i>
- Busy night.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.418
May I have your,
uh, member number?

26:25.502 --> 26:30.548
<i>My number is
D-4-1-3-6-6-2-1-8.</i>

26:43.645 --> 26:45.897
<i>David James, out.</i>

26:47.440 --> 26:51.111
Okay, we've got two more left
in the building. Sit tight.

26:52.696 --> 26:55.740
I want a team on him 24/7.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.909
And nothing leaves the building.
Understood?

26:57.993 --> 26:59.369
<i>Copy that.</i>

26:59.452 --> 27:01.788
Oh, and while you're at it,

27:01.871 --> 27:05.709
take a look at Kira Korrigan,
with a "K."

27:05.792 --> 27:08.211
May or may not teach
at the ski school.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.588
<i>- Hands-free?</i>
- Yeah.

27:10.672 --> 27:15.343
And he's surveillance-conscious,
so we watch, we listen,

27:15.427 --> 27:18.263
but we do not disturb.
As far as he's concerned,

27:18.346 --> 27:19.973
I still think
he's the happy defector

27:20.056 --> 27:21.516
going about his happy life.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.560
Who knows? Maybe he is.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.271
<i>St. Paul's
is filled to capacity,</i>

27:26.354 --> 27:29.149
<i>demonstrators now beginning
to gather outside</i>

27:29.232 --> 27:31.443
<i>for the rally at the Capitol
that will follow</i>

27:31.526 --> 27:33.611
<i>this evening's
memorial service.</i>

27:33.695 --> 27:36.072
<i>The gathering has been
peaceful so far,</i>

27:36.156 --> 27:39.576
<i>marked by a sense of
solemnity and mourning.</i>

27:39.659 --> 27:42.078
<i>But there is palpable tension
in the air,</i>

27:42.162 --> 27:44.914
<i>in anticipation
of the upcoming rally.</i>

27:44.998 --> 27:46.833
<i>Law enforcement
a prominent presence</i>

27:46.916 --> 27:50.128
<i>throughout the downtown area
and also the target</i>

27:50.211 --> 27:53.214
<i>of much of the anger
on the streets today.</i>

27:53.298 --> 27:55.717
<i>Let's take a live look
inside the church.</i>

27:55.800 --> 27:57.969
<i>You can see
Councilwoman Emily Kent</i>

27:58.053 --> 28:01.431
<i>in the aisle on your right,
greeting Reverend Pyne.</i>

28:01.514 --> 28:06.061
<i>Family of Bo Elkins, slain in
yesterday's confrontation,</i>

28:06.144 --> 28:07.896
<i>seated at the front
of the church.</i>

28:07.979 --> 28:11.066
<i>Mary Elkins and her daughter
Rachel sitting together...</i>

28:11.149 --> 28:13.485
<i>...and directly behind them,</i>

28:13.568 --> 28:15.195
<i>- the Kent family...</i>
- Yep.

28:15.278 --> 28:16.905
<i>...who lost three
of their loved ones</i>

28:16.988 --> 28:18.740
<i>in yesterday's tragic
confrontation.</i>

28:18.823 --> 28:20.283
- Okay.
<i>- The Elkins family...</i>

<i>...was sheltering fugitive</i>

28:21.951 --> 28:24.204
<i>radio personality
Brett O'Keefe on their...</i>

28:24.287 --> 28:25.789
No sign of Jackie
at the church.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.792
She won't answer her phone,
her brother won't answer

28:28.875 --> 28:30.543
- his phone.
- Goddamn it.

28:34.005 --> 28:36.591
Okay. Tell the mayor
we're with him

28:36.674 --> 28:39.010
on water cannons
and tear gas.

28:39.094 --> 28:42.597
We don't want rubber bullets,
nothing that looks like a gun

28:42.680 --> 28:46.601
as long
as is humanly possible.

28:46.684 --> 28:50.939
That may not be
a position he can hold.

28:51.022 --> 28:53.983
Do me a fucking favor and tell
him that is what I'd like.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.361
I realize things happen.

28:58.488 --> 29:00.281
National Guard?

29:06.746 --> 29:08.832
- Yeah.
<i>- Reverend Douglas Pyne</i>

29:08.915 --> 29:11.668
<i>is now about
to begin his invocation.</i>

29:11.751 --> 29:13.920
<i>There seems to be some
commotion there</i>

29:14.003 --> 29:15.505
<i>at the back of the church.</i>

29:15.588 --> 29:18.341
<i>Not sure yet
what exactly's going on.</i>

29:18.425 --> 29:22.887
<i>There was a rumor that the
wives of the slain FBI agents</i>

29:22.971 --> 29:25.265
<i>- might attend this service.</i>
- Elizabeth.

29:25.348 --> 29:28.184
<i>Seemed unlikely,
but that could be</i>

29:28.268 --> 29:30.311
<i>what we're seeing right now.</i>

29:46.161 --> 29:48.329
- No.
- What are you doing here?

29:53.460 --> 29:56.296
Hey! No one asked you here.

29:56.379 --> 29:58.923
<i>Get the fuck out.</i>

30:22.906 --> 30:24.240
Are you Mrs. Goodman?

30:24.324 --> 30:26.701
Yes.

30:29.287 --> 30:30.914
I'm Mary Elkins.

30:38.963 --> 30:41.716
Come with me, all of you.

30:52.602 --> 30:54.103
Move over, honey.

31:20.213 --> 31:23.925
I want a live feed on
all the networks tonight.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.595
<i>I called about
an hour ago, and you--</i>

31:27.679 --> 31:29.264
<i>you said you were
sending a truck.</i>

31:29.347 --> 31:30.974
Yeah, can I have
your member number?

31:31.057 --> 31:33.059
- <i>Ah. Uh...</i>
- How much longer?

31:33.142 --> 31:34.561
<i>- ...my number is, uh...</i>
- Bennet, you in?

31:41.192 --> 31:43.111
Bennet?

31:43.194 --> 31:44.737
Ten minutes.

31:44.821 --> 31:47.282
<i>Bennet's in. We just need to
wait for the last employee</i>

31:47.365 --> 31:48.825
to get out of the building,
then we're a go.

31:48.908 --> 31:51.119
Ma'am, I got a truck
about two miles away.

31:51.202 --> 31:54.539
It'll be there in about
ten, 15 minutes.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.833
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

31:58.626 --> 32:03.339
<i>See the door?</i>

32:06.926 --> 32:10.471
- Rosen.
- That's everybody.

32:10.555 --> 32:14.559
Building's clear. H.V.1 is sole
occupant. Last call, people.

32:14.642 --> 32:17.478
<i>All right, Bennet, on your go.</i>

32:20.231 --> 32:22.859
<i>Putain.</i>

32:34.787 --> 32:36.539
Andy?

32:38.082 --> 32:39.834
Andy?

32:52.347 --> 32:54.432
<i>J'en ai marre de ça.</i>

33:00.438 --> 33:02.732
Andy?

33:04.233 --> 33:07.445
Stop!

33:17.538 --> 33:19.874
- Stop it.
- Let me go!

33:23.544 --> 33:24.921
Aah!

33:25.004 --> 33:26.881
I said fucking stop it.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.883
Aah!

33:32.303 --> 33:34.722
Don't make me
ask you twice again.

33:38.559 --> 33:41.396
Last week, you brought
$50,000 in cash

33:41.479 --> 33:43.481
to Hazelton, West Virginia.
Yes or no?

33:43.564 --> 33:46.442
I...

33:46.526 --> 33:48.403
<i>I..</i>.

33:48.486 --> 33:49.862
Don't try to talk.
Just nod your head.

33:55.118 --> 33:56.619
Here's the deal.

33:56.703 --> 34:01.290
I'm not gonna lie to you,
and you're not gonna lie to me.

34:06.129 --> 34:09.215
That 50 grand was payment

34:09.298 --> 34:11.259
to murder General McClendon
in prison.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.510
Yes or no?

34:17.849 --> 34:22.270
Yes or fucking no?

34:25.398 --> 34:27.150
Good.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.152
Now...

34:29.235 --> 34:31.237
...here's what
you're gonna do next.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.322
You're gonna get me

34:33.406 --> 34:36.993
another 100 grand.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.954
- I can't.
- Yes, you can and you will,

34:40.037 --> 34:41.789
because I will be
outside your house

34:41.873 --> 34:44.167
first thing
Thursday morning.

34:44.250 --> 34:48.337
238 Wygart.
Blue pillows on the bed.

34:48.421 --> 34:50.381
Yeah.

34:50.465 --> 34:52.633
I'm watchin', baby.

34:52.717 --> 34:55.762
I got nothing to do
but you.

35:01.976 --> 35:04.896
Yeah, it's live. Thank you.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.506
That was a little rough,
don't you think?

35:31.589 --> 35:34.550
<i>Hey, that wasn't me.
It was Stein.</i>

35:54.028 --> 35:57.532
<i>H.V.1 is
exiting the building.</i>

36:14.423 --> 36:16.717
She's looking for a cab.
Get ready to move.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.890
<i>Come on, baby. Run to Papa.</i>

36:32.692 --> 36:33.901
Why didn't she take the cab?

36:33.985 --> 36:36.404
Carrie, did you hear that
motorcycle on your mic?

36:36.487 --> 36:39.073
- We didn't pick it up.
- What?

36:39.156 --> 36:41.284
Bug's not transmitting.

36:42.827 --> 36:44.328
The bug's dead. Fuck!

36:44.412 --> 36:47.456
She's going to the bar
on the corner.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.084
Doxie, you getting this?
We don't have ears.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.420
<i>I'm going in.</i>

37:29.248 --> 37:32.084
- She's hitting the head.
- Goddamn it.
Anson, that is why I said

37:32.168 --> 37:33.502
<i>we needed another female
on the team,</i>

37:33.586 --> 37:35.171
<i>not for fucking solidarity.</i>

37:35.254 --> 37:37.882
Yeah, that's--
that's my bad.

37:37.965 --> 37:40.843
Max, you got another bug?

37:40.927 --> 37:43.346
- Yeah.
- Pull it.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.850
Go in. I'll call it.

37:47.934 --> 37:50.311
- You sure?
- Go.

37:52.146 --> 37:53.773
Mathison's coming in.

37:53.856 --> 37:55.441
Doxie, is there a back
entrance to this place?

37:55.524 --> 37:57.568
Yeah.

37:59.904 --> 38:01.697
- Who's free?
- Here.

38:01.781 --> 38:03.115
- Bennet?
<i>- I'll cover it.</i>

38:03.199 --> 38:05.576
Drop it in her bag.

38:38.401 --> 38:40.403
Christ.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.614
Oh, shit! I'm such a klutz.

38:43.698 --> 38:46.158
Jesus.

38:46.242 --> 38:47.576
Here.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.996
Thanks.

38:51.539 --> 38:55.084
I really can't drink anymore,
like, at all.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.669
<i>Ugh.</i>

39:21.318 --> 39:22.653
You talk to Wyatt?

39:22.737 --> 39:25.281
Aside from the few arrests,
the march was peaceful,

39:25.364 --> 39:26.949
and the crowd
at the State Capitol

39:27.033 --> 39:29.368
is dispersing as we speak.

39:31.871 --> 39:35.291
In a few weeks, quietly reach
out to Mary Elkins.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.001
I wanna meet that woman.

39:37.084 --> 39:38.294
Ma'am, if we can
have you in the chair,

39:38.377 --> 39:39.628
- I need to get a level.
- Yeah.

39:42.256 --> 39:43.257
Hey.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.426
I really need to see you.
Are you home?

39:45.509 --> 39:48.721
<i>I'm in the Oval.
She's about to go live on TV</i>

39:48.804 --> 39:50.431
<i>in, like, three minutes,</i>

39:50.514 --> 39:52.933
but she says
she'll keep it brief.

39:53.017 --> 39:54.435
And then
we're going dark here,

39:54.518 --> 39:57.271
so I should be home
in about 45 minutes.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.773
<i>You wanna meet me there?</i>

39:58.856 --> 40:01.734
- Yeah, that's great.
<i>- Okay. See you soon.</i>

40:12.870 --> 40:15.581
Excuse me? I will have
a glass of the Cabernet.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.083
Yeah, sure.

40:23.380 --> 40:24.715
Who'd she call?

40:24.799 --> 40:28.135
Wellington. Meeting at
his place in 45 minutes.

40:28.219 --> 40:30.012
She ordered a Cabernet.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.807
What?

40:32.890 --> 40:35.768
Nothin'. Slick is all.

40:35.851 --> 40:39.855
All right, motherfuckers,
we're back in business.

40:39.939 --> 40:42.108
Oh, fuck.

40:48.989 --> 40:50.825
And we're on in three...

40:53.119 --> 40:55.663
<i>Like many of you at home,</i>

40:55.746 --> 40:57.915
<i>I watched the coverage
of the memorial service</i>

40:57.998 --> 41:01.585
<i>honoring the men,
women, and children</i>

41:01.669 --> 41:04.630
<i>killed in Lucasville, Virginia.</i>

41:04.713 --> 41:07.675
<i>I was moved beyond words
to see Jackie Goodman,</i>

41:07.758 --> 41:10.845
<i>Susanna Cole, and Sujin Kim</i>

41:10.928 --> 41:14.807
mourning together with
Mary Elkins, her family,

41:14.890 --> 41:17.726
and all of Virginia
at today's memorial.

41:17.810 --> 41:21.480
Their selfless efforts to
rise above their own pain

41:21.564 --> 41:26.402
and recognize a shared grief
was an instruction to me.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.947
<i>I don't think the message
has ever been clearer.</i>

41:30.030 --> 41:33.826
<i>We cannot allow what divides us
as individuals</i>

41:33.909 --> 41:36.954
<i>to continue to undermine
what unites us</i>

41:37.037 --> 41:42.835
as a people, what brings us
together as Americans.

41:44.211 --> 41:45.421
She's getting an Uber.

41:45.504 --> 41:49.216
- Where to?
- Running the address.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.260
David Wellington's.

41:55.055 --> 41:57.183
We're looking for
an Uber, gray Mazda,

41:57.266 --> 42:01.395
Victor Bravo India 9-3-2.
- Copy.

42:07.776 --> 42:09.028
She's leavin'.

42:09.111 --> 42:10.946
<i>Anson, you up?</i>

42:11.030 --> 42:13.032
Yep.

42:29.173 --> 42:30.925
<i>- Simone?
- Yes.</i>

42:31.008 --> 42:34.094
<i>Hey. We're going
to Georgetown?</i>

42:34.178 --> 42:35.387
<i>That's right.</i>

42:35.471 --> 42:38.140
<i>We're on them.</i>

42:43.270 --> 42:47.233
- Stay with them.
We'll hang back a few blocks.
- Yeah.

43:02.915 --> 43:05.292
That was a nice save.

43:05.376 --> 43:06.585
What, in the van?

43:06.669 --> 43:08.420
Yeah.

43:08.504 --> 43:10.297
You didn't need saving.

43:10.381 --> 43:12.758
I called the op for three
minutes, then you came back.

43:12.841 --> 43:16.011
It was an important
three minutes.

43:16.095 --> 43:17.846
Why do I feel like I'm
getting patted on the head

43:17.930 --> 43:20.224
for a finger painting?

43:20.307 --> 43:22.935
If you can't take
a compliment, then...

43:23.018 --> 43:26.105
Okay. Fine.

43:26.188 --> 43:27.439
Thank you.

43:30.567 --> 43:34.446
<i>We are comin' in for a landing.</i>

43:34.530 --> 43:36.156
You got a good view?

43:36.240 --> 43:38.284
<i>Yep.</i>

43:39.910 --> 43:41.745
<i>Thank you.</i>

43:41.829 --> 43:43.372
<i>Have a nice night.</i>

43:43.455 --> 43:45.416
<i>Okay, she's out of the car.</i>

43:47.376 --> 43:50.629
And she is on her way
to the house.

43:50.713 --> 43:54.091
And there's H.V.2.

43:54.174 --> 43:58.470
- Wellington's home?
<i>- Live and in person.</i>

44:01.390 --> 44:03.100
<i>Hey.</i>

44:03.183 --> 44:05.519
<i>No, man, I gotta
fucking go to work.</i>

44:05.602 --> 44:07.855
<i>I told Shelley I can
rehearse on Saturday...</i>

44:07.938 --> 44:10.566
- Max, what the fuck is that?
- Oh, shit.

44:14.111 --> 44:16.613
Maybe our channels got crossed.

44:16.697 --> 44:17.906
Um...

44:17.990 --> 44:19.992
<i>Give me a second.</i>

44:20.075 --> 44:22.911
<i>No, no, no, man.</i>

44:22.995 --> 44:24.955
<i>I'm just tired of the bullshit.</i>

44:25.039 --> 44:26.707
<i>Ever since she started dating
that new dude...</i>

44:26.790 --> 44:28.292
<i>- it's just bullshit...</i>
- The purse.

44:28.375 --> 44:31.545
- The purse, the purse.
- It's the fucking Uber driver.

44:31.628 --> 44:33.172
- She doesn't have the bag.
- She left it.

44:33.255 --> 44:35.799
- <i>She left it in the goddamn Uber.</i>
- Fuck!

44:35.883 --> 44:38.469
<i>- Follow the Uber.</i>
- Hang on.

44:38.552 --> 44:39.887
Max, get Doxie a 20
on the Uber.

44:39.970 --> 44:42.222
<i>Doxie, run down
the fucking Uber.</i>

44:42.306 --> 44:44.558
- And say what?
<i>- Dude, pick up the phone,</i>

44:44.641 --> 44:46.935
call the driver, tell him
to return the goddamn bag.

44:47.019 --> 44:48.729
And then he knocks
on Wellington's door

44:48.812 --> 44:51.565
and says, "You called me"?

44:51.648 --> 44:53.067
In ten minutes, he's gonna
realize there's a purse

44:53.150 --> 44:54.318
in his car.
He'll bring it back.

44:54.401 --> 44:56.820
In ten minutes, they will have
discussed this already.

44:56.904 --> 44:58.614
Blackmail about a prison hit
ordered by the president?

44:58.697 --> 44:59.948
It's a longer conversation.

45:00.032 --> 45:01.617
Which is why
we need to hear it.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.243
Carrie,

45:03.327 --> 45:05.412
we needed to establish a link
between the money, Simone,

45:05.496 --> 45:08.957
- and Wellington. We have it.
<i>- Guys?</i>

45:09.041 --> 45:10.876
Are we going after
the Uber or what?

45:10.959 --> 45:13.170
You asked me to tell you when
you're not thinking clearly.

45:13.253 --> 45:16.423
We established a goal for
the mission. We reached it.

45:16.507 --> 45:20.886
A transcript would've
been nice, but it's gravy.

45:23.680 --> 45:27.267
Don't worry about
the Uber. Pull out.

45:48.580 --> 45:50.874
I'll call you in the morning.

45:50.958 --> 45:52.334
Hey, hey, hey.

45:52.418 --> 45:54.002
Hold on a second.

45:55.295 --> 45:56.839
Don't beat yourself up
so much. We did good.

45:56.922 --> 46:00.092
More or less.

46:00.175 --> 46:01.844
I mean, more, I'd say.

46:01.927 --> 46:04.596
I don't know. I mean, two bugs
crap out on one mission?

46:04.680 --> 46:06.682
They didn't. One crapped out,
one's driving around town.

46:06.765 --> 46:09.435
- That kind of shit happens
all the time.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

46:09.518 --> 46:11.478
Okay.

46:14.690 --> 46:16.442
How about
we let Paley decide?

46:16.525 --> 46:18.026
What do you mean?

46:18.110 --> 46:20.654
Well, we know Simone was
in Hazelton with $50,000.

46:20.737 --> 46:22.823
We know McClendon was
dead the next day.

46:22.906 --> 46:24.825
And now we know the person
she went running to

46:24.908 --> 46:27.453
at the first sign of trouble
was David Wellington.

46:27.536 --> 46:29.413
I'd say that's enough
to haul her up in front

46:29.496 --> 46:32.624
of a Senate committee,
ask her a few questions.

46:32.708 --> 46:35.961
- Don't you think?
- Maybe, yeah.

46:36.044 --> 46:38.297
- Maybe?
- No, no. No, you're right.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.340
I...

46:40.424 --> 46:43.719
I think
I just need some sleep.

46:43.802 --> 46:46.805
Good idea.

46:46.889 --> 46:49.933
I'll call you
in the morning.

47:25.969 --> 47:29.097
Tell me we got it.

47:29.181 --> 47:31.558
Yeah, but something
fucked is happening.

47:31.642 --> 47:32.976
Well, of course it is.
Two bugs don't blow on one--

47:33.060 --> 47:35.521
Forget the bugs. It's--
it's worse than that.

47:35.604 --> 47:38.190
Watch the tape.

47:38.273 --> 47:40.359
<i>Long day?</i>

47:40.442 --> 47:43.070
<i>Very,
not that that's news.</i>

47:43.153 --> 47:45.364
<i>How was the speech?</i>

47:45.447 --> 47:47.157
<i>- It was great.
- That's fantastic.</i>

47:47.241 --> 47:49.952
<i>It is. She's been back
on her heels for so long,</i>

47:50.035 --> 47:51.787
<i>it's a relief.</i>

47:51.870 --> 47:55.207
<i>Hey, listen, my phone's
got to stay on tonight.</i>

47:55.290 --> 47:58.919
<i>Still touch and go at some
of the demonstrations,</i>

47:59.002 --> 48:01.421
<i>but we're
cautiously optimistic.</i>

48:01.505 --> 48:02.839
<i>Mmm.</i>

48:02.923 --> 48:05.259
<i>I'm glad, because you
deserve a break.</i>

48:05.342 --> 48:08.470
<i>Are you okay? You sounded
upset on the phone.</i>

48:08.554 --> 48:11.056
<i>I'm fine.
Why, were you worried?</i>

48:11.139 --> 48:13.475
<i>Of course. You said,
"I need to see you."</i>

48:13.559 --> 48:15.102
<i>That's worrying.</i>

48:15.185 --> 48:19.106
<i>Ah, you're so sweet.
I was itchy all day.</i>

48:19.189 --> 48:20.983
<i>I couldn't get you
out of my head.</i>

48:21.066 --> 48:22.776
<i>That's a need, right?</i>

48:22.859 --> 48:25.529
<i>Oh. That kind of need.</i>

48:25.612 --> 48:28.198
<i>Next time,
I'll be more clear.</i>

48:30.242 --> 48:32.369
- What the fuck is that?
- Yeah.

48:32.452 --> 48:34.871
Is there any point where she
says, "I got jumped in the dark

48:34.955 --> 48:36.957
and we need $100,000"?

48:37.040 --> 48:38.083
No.

48:42.296 --> 48:44.423
<i>Do me a favor, Chief.</i>

48:44.506 --> 48:46.258
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

48:52.889 --> 48:54.766
<i>You feel so good.</i>

48:54.850 --> 48:56.351
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

48:59.187 --> 49:02.482
It goes on like this
for a while.

49:10.032 --> 49:11.700
What the fuck?!
