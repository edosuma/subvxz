00:01.372 --> 00:02.533
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.533 --> 00:04.535
I ASKED FOR AN ASSAULT
NOT A RAMPAGE.

00:04.535 --> 00:08.039
BITCH HAD HER OWN SON BEAT UP
JUST TO GET HIM BACK HOME.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.280
THIS IS YOUR E.H.M. BRACELET.

IF IT STAYS RED
LONGER THAN 30 SECONDS...

00:11.011 --> 00:13.314
(bracelet beeping)
 IT'LL NOTIFY US THAT YOU
VIOLATED HOUSE ARREST.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.216
THE GRAYSONS CLAIM TO HAVE
TWO EYEWITNESSES

00:15.216 --> 00:18.219
WHO CAN PLACE YOU ON THE BEACH
AFTER TYLER BARROL WAS MURDERED.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.720
(Declan) I DON'T CARE
WHO YOU'RE PROTECTING OR WHY,

00:19.720 --> 00:22.193
BUT AS OF NOW, I'M GONNA
START PROTECTING YOU.

00:22.193 --> 00:24.055
WHATEVER OR WHOMEVER
YOU'RE DOING,

00:24.055 --> 00:25.656
YOU'D BETTER DAMN WELL
BE DISCREET.

00:25.656 --> 00:27.228
(gasps)

00:27.228 --> 00:28.399
WE FOUND OUT AMANDA'S
IN MONTREAL.

00:28.399 --> 00:29.760
I'M GOING AFTER HER.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.202
"CHARLOTTE GRAYSON

00:31.202 --> 00:32.563
"of prescription pain pills

00:34.065 --> 00:35.666
YOU SOLD ME OUT.

00:35.666 --> 00:38.469
DECLAN'S RECANTED HIS STATEMENT
ABOUT SEEING THE HOODED MAN

00:38.469 --> 00:40.671
ON THE BEACH.

GREATEST LAWYERS,

"THERE IS NO SUCH THING

THE SHOOTER WAS STANDING

01:09.340 --> 01:12.143
APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET
FROM THE VICTIM...

01:12.143 --> 01:14.605
PERHAPS BECAUSE JUSTICE
IS A FLAWED CONCEPT.

01:14.605 --> 01:18.309
THAT ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN
TO THE DECISION OF 12 PEOPLE.

01:18.309 --> 01:21.152
BANG.

01:21.152 --> 01:26.217
KILLING TYLER BARROL
IN COLD BLOOD.

01:26.217 --> 01:28.419

THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES

01:28.419 --> 01:32.092

01:44.605 --> 01:47.608
WHICH IS WHY,
WHEN THE SYSTEM FAILS US,

01:47.608 --> 01:50.181
WE MUST GO OUT
AND SEEK OUR OWN JUSTICE.

01:50.181 --> 01:51.482
THE DEFENDANT--

01:51.482 --> 01:54.315
DANIEL GRAYSON.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.151

HOLDING UP?

02:00.151 --> 02:01.392

SURPRISE DECISION TO CALL

02:06.627 --> 02:09.128
CHARLOTTE GRAYSON'S BOYFRIEND
AS THEIR FINAL WITNESS?

02:09.128 --> 02:10.601
EX-BOYFRIEND.

02:10.601 --> 02:12.433
DECLAN PORTER IS
A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL YOUNG MAN.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.865
ARE YOU SAYING HE'S
AN UNRELIABLE WITNESS?

02:14.865 --> 02:18.309
I'M SAYING THAT HE'S A TEENAGER
NURSING HIS FIRST BROKEN HEART.

02:18.309 --> 02:19.810
YOU CAN DRAW
YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.

02:19.810 --> 02:22.543
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING MORE
ABOUT DANIEL'S STATE OF MIND

02:22.543 --> 02:24.245
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT?

NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME.

I HAVEN'T DONE SHOTS LIKE THAT

03:00.281 --> 03:02.383
NEW YORK, I THINK.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.655
NOT CITY. IT WAS SOMEWHERE

THAT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE
ON THE BEACH THAT NIGHT.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.331
WHICH IS A LIE.

04:20.331 --> 04:21.832

UNDER THE INFLUENCE

04:21.832 --> 04:24.735
OF PRESCRIPTION PILLS
AT THE TIME,

04:24.735 --> 04:26.266
WHICH MEANS,
WE CAN'T PUT YOU ON THE STAND

04:26.266 --> 04:27.868
TO REFUTE HIS TESTIMONY.
 (Brooks) HOWEVER,

04:27.868 --> 04:29.870
I DO HAVE AN EXPERT
WHO WILL TESTIFY

04:29.870 --> 04:32.373
THAT THE BLOOD SPATTER
ON DANIEL'S JACKET

04:34.345 --> 04:36.046

THE JURY TO SEE IT THAT WAY.

04:40.311 --> 04:42.983

REASONABLE DOUBT,

04:42.983 --> 04:46.357
WE HAVE TO PAINT DANIEL
AS SYMPATHETIC,

TO OPEN MY ARGUMENT

AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY.

SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT.

05:16.487 --> 05:19.590

05:39.640 --> 05:41.972
IT'S LIKELY SHE'LL VOTE
TO CONVICT.

05:41.972 --> 05:45.345
IF I CAN'T AT LEAST PLANT
REASONABLE DOUBT IN HER MIND,

05:45.345 --> 05:47.778

THE MURDER TWO DEAL.

05:47.778 --> 05:49.119
WELL...

28:46.896 --> 28:48.427
INNOCENT TILL PROVEN GUILTY.

28:48.427 --> 28:51.130
OH, YEAH, BUT I HAVE PROOF
IN THE FORM OF

28:51.130 --> 28:54.333
MY VERY FIRST de KOONING
THAT I PURCHASED,

28:54.333 --> 28:58.207
BROKERED BY A FETCHING
YOUNG VICKY HARPER YEARS AGO.

28:58.207 --> 29:00.770
YOU SEE, I HAD
THAT PAINTING APPRAISED

29:00.770 --> 29:02.772
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT SHE'D
SUNK BACK IN WITH YOU,

29:02.772 --> 29:04.774
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT
THAT de KOONING

29:04.774 --> 29:07.516
IS WORTH LESS

29:07.516 --> 29:09.048
THAN THE FRAME IT'S IN.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.880
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

29:10.880 --> 29:13.322
YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK,
HMM?

29:13.322 --> 29:17.356
OR DO YOU WANT TO JUST
EXCISE ME

29:17.356 --> 29:19.789
LIKE YOU DID TO THE LAST MAN
SHE LOVED?

29:19.789 --> 29:22.061
OH, YEAH, SHE TOLD ME

29:22.061 --> 29:23.793
WHAT YOU DID
TO DAVID CLARKE.

29:23.793 --> 29:26.065
SHE TOLD YOU
WHAT I DID?

29:26.065 --> 29:28.467
WHAT YOU BOTH DID.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.800
YEAH, WELL, EVENTUALLY,
YOU WOULD'VE LEARNED

29:30.800 --> 29:32.401
THAT VICTORIA'S WORD
IS ABOUT AS AUTHENTIC

29:32.401 --> 29:34.043
AS THE PAINTINGS
YOU FORGED.

29:34.043 --> 29:35.544
BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

29:35.544 --> 29:37.306
NO, I'M NOT HERE
TO EXCISE YOU.

29:37.306 --> 29:38.808
I KNOW I'M NOT
THE ONLY WEALTHY COLLECTOR

29:38.808 --> 29:42.151
YOU AND VICTORIA WORKED YOUR CON
ON ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

29:42.151 --> 29:47.086
SO IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO FINALIZE VICTORIA'S SHAME,

29:47.086 --> 29:48.787
I COULD HAVE HER ARRESTED

29:48.787 --> 29:51.190
FOR KNOWINGLY BROKERING
FORGED CLASSICS.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.462
OR...

29:53.462 --> 29:56.926
YOU COULD DO
THE NOBLE THING.

29:56.926 --> 29:59.929
YOU COULD TAKE YOUR CURRENT
SPATE OF MASTERPIECES

29:59.929 --> 30:01.430
AND YOU COULD
CLEAR OUT OF THIS JOINT

30:01.430 --> 30:04.333
AND LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND...

30:05.474 --> 30:08.307
BUT MY WIFE.

30:10.039 --> 30:13.012
YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT WANNA LEAVE...

30:14.543 --> 30:16.285
BEFORE I BREAK EVERY ONE

30:16.285 --> 30:21.520
OF THE 14 BONES
IN YOUR FACE.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.151
(cell phone rings)

30:52.151 --> 30:54.453
(ring)

30:54.453 --> 30:56.886
(rings and beeps)

31:02.291 --> 31:03.462
(lock clicks)

31:03.462 --> 31:05.864
(keys jangle)

31:09.138 --> 31:11.400
DANIEL,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:11.400 --> 31:12.541
I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

31:14.303 --> 31:16.645
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.
YOUR ANKLE MONITOR--

31:16.645 --> 31:18.047
I'M NOT LEAVING
UNTIL YOU TELL ME

31:18.047 --> 31:19.448
WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE REALLY UP TO.

31:19.448 --> 31:21.310
MAYBE MY MOM WAS RIGHT
ABOUT YOU.

31:21.310 --> 31:22.551
MAYBE TYLER WAS, TOO.

31:22.551 --> 31:24.553
HOW MUCH
HAVE YOU HAD TO DRINK?

31:24.553 --> 31:25.884
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.357
I SAW YOU YESTERDAY
WITH JACK.

31:28.357 --> 31:30.159
IS THAT WHERE YOU WENT,
TO SEE HIM?

31:30.159 --> 31:32.221
DANIEL, STOP--
 YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?

31:32.221 --> 31:33.923
ALL THE MYSTERIOUS
PHONE CALLS,

31:33.923 --> 31:36.195
ALL THE TIMES
YOU DISAPPEARED...

31:36.195 --> 31:38.267
HAVE YOU BEEN SNEAKING AROUND
WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME?

31:38.267 --> 31:40.399
THAT'S RIDICULOUS--

31:40.399 --> 31:43.472
DON'T LIE TO ME!

31:43.472 --> 31:45.404
I'M SORRY--

31:45.404 --> 31:47.676
(man) FREEZE! RIGHT THERE.
 FREEZE!
HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM.

31:47.676 --> 31:49.608
HANDS UP. DON'T MOVE.
HANDS UP.

31:49.608 --> 31:52.141
GET DOWN.
LET'S GO. FACEDOWN.

31:52.141 --> 31:54.183
DOWN.

31:54.183 --> 31:56.315
DANIEL GRAYSON,
YOU'RE IN DIRECT VIOLATION

31:56.315 --> 31:57.916
OF YOUR HOUSE ARREST.
 (handcuffs click)

31:57.916 --> 32:00.919
(man speaking indistinctly)

32:07.126 --> 32:08.327
HOW LONG BEFORE DANIEL'S
RELEASED BACK TO US, MR. BROOKS?

32:08.327 --> 32:09.498
(Brooks)
I'm heading to Rikers now

32:09.498 --> 32:11.030
to get Daniel's side
of the story.

32:11.030 --> 32:14.563
Once I have the facts, I'll set
a meeting with the judge.

32:14.563 --> 32:17.106
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'LL BE THERE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

32:17.106 --> 32:20.439
I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHY HE'D VIOLATE HOUSE ARREST.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.011
I DO.

32:25.214 --> 32:28.017
LET ME CALL YOU BACK.
 (beeps)

32:28.017 --> 32:31.950
DANIEL THOUGHT THAT I WAS
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH JACK.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.452
I ASSURED HIM THAT
THAT WASN'T TRUE,

32:33.452 --> 32:36.685
THAT... I'M NOT
THAT KIND OF PERSON.

32:38.287 --> 32:42.291
BUT THE TRUTH IS, I HAVE BEEN
GETTING CLOSER TO JACK...

32:42.291 --> 32:44.994
TO GET INFORMATION
ON AMANDA.

32:44.994 --> 32:47.066
JACK CLAIMS HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.497
AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM?

32:50.269 --> 32:54.003
I WENT TO THE STOWAWAY
TO SEARCH HIS APARTMENT.

32:54.003 --> 32:55.344
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

32:55.344 --> 32:57.146
NOTHING.

32:57.146 --> 32:59.978
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
JACK'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

33:03.252 --> 33:05.714
IF THE JURY
CONVICTS DANIEL FOR THIS,

33:05.714 --> 33:07.586
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.519
WELL, THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

33:10.519 --> 33:12.121
BUT FORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS

33:12.121 --> 33:14.663
THAT MIGHT HELP SHAPE
THE JURY'S OPINION.

33:14.663 --> 33:17.166
FOR EXAMPLE?

33:17.166 --> 33:19.168
YOUR TESTIMONY, OF COURSE.

33:19.168 --> 33:21.070
SO GO HOME, EMILY,

33:21.070 --> 33:24.433
AND TOMORROW DELIVER
THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR LIFE.

33:35.684 --> 33:37.186
WHAT THE HELL?

33:37.186 --> 33:38.517
YEAH, WE GOT ROBBED, 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHAT THIS DAY NEEDED.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.149
(man) Suffolk County Police.
What town?

33:40.149 --> 33:41.650
MONTAUK.
 Please hold.

33:41.650 --> 33:43.252
YEAH, I'LL HOLD.

33:43.252 --> 33:44.723
HEY, I'M ON
WITH THE POLICE.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.025
HANG ON.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.658
COMPUTER...

33:49.658 --> 33:52.061
TV--NOTHING'S MISSING.

33:53.732 --> 33:55.304
OH, GOD.

33:55.304 --> 33:57.706
WHAT? WHAT?

34:01.810 --> 34:03.772
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 HANG UP THE PHONE.

34:03.772 --> 34:05.144
WHAT?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.515
HANG UP THE PHONE!

34:06.515 --> 34:07.676
(beeps)

34:07.676 --> 34:10.279
THE HOODIE... IT'S GONE.

34:18.427 --> 34:20.759
(sirens wailing)

34:20.759 --> 34:23.331
(tires screeching)

34:23.331 --> 34:24.632
(wailing continues)

34:24.632 --> 34:26.635
HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD.

34:26.635 --> 34:28.137
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
 IS THIS YOUR VEHICLE?

34:28.137 --> 34:29.297
WHAT OF IT?

34:29.297 --> 34:30.799
AN AMBER ALERT WAS ISSUED.

34:30.799 --> 34:32.170
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.802
WHAT THE HELL?
I DIDN'T KIDNAP ANYBODY.

34:33.802 --> 34:35.103
RELAX.
 MATCHES YOUR PLATES.

34:35.103 --> 34:36.074
OH, COME ON. HEY.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.077
(handcuffs click)

34:42.650 --> 34:43.851
WHAT'S THAT?

34:43.851 --> 34:45.484
ON YOUR SWEATSHIRT,
IS THAT BLOOD?

34:45.484 --> 34:46.815
THAT'S NOT MINE.
THAT'S NOT MINE.

34:46.815 --> 34:48.857
LEE MORAN,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

34:48.857 --> 34:50.659
OH, COME ON.
THAT'S NOT MY SWEATSHIRT.
 YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

34:50.659 --> 34:52.621
I'M BEING SET UP.
 ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

34:52.621 --> 34:54.163
IN A COURT OF LAW.

34:54.163 --> 34:56.094
MAN, EMS, WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA USE LEE

34:56.094 --> 34:57.266
AS YOUR PAWN,

34:57.266 --> 34:58.397
YOU WEREN'T KIDDING.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.269
CHECKMATE.

35:00.269 --> 35:02.401
What happens if they find
Jack's D.N.A.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.732
on the hoodie?

35:03.732 --> 35:05.734
THEY'LL LINK IT TO THE NIGHT
THAT LEE BEAT UP JACK,

35:05.734 --> 35:08.437
REINFORCING HIS STATUS
AS THE GRAYSON FAMILY GOON.

35:08.437 --> 35:10.339
So in one fell swoop,

35:10.339 --> 35:13.142
YOU MANAGED TO PROTECT JACK,
EXONERATE DANIEL,

35:13.142 --> 35:16.585
AND FORCE LEE INTO
SELLING OUT THE GRAYSONS

35:16.585 --> 35:18.387
TO SAVE HIMSELF.

35:18.387 --> 35:21.820
HAVEN'T YOU TIED EVERYTHING UP
IN ONE NEAT LITTLE BOW?

35:21.820 --> 35:23.152
ALMOST.

35:23.152 --> 35:24.423
ARE YOU AT THE STOWAWAY?

35:24.423 --> 35:26.455
MM.
STANDING RIGHT OUTSIDE.

35:26.455 --> 35:28.157
GOOD.

35:28.157 --> 35:29.828
THERE'S ONE LOOSE END
I'M LEAVING TO YOU.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.631
SO YOU THINK THE GRAYSONS
HAD THE GUY WHO BEAT ME UP

35:32.631 --> 35:34.203
BREAK IN HERE A SECOND TIME
AND STEAL MY HOODIE?

35:34.203 --> 35:35.504
THE GRAYSONS DID WHAT?

35:35.504 --> 35:38.367
IT'S JUST A HYPOTHESIS,
BUT IT MAKES SENSE, DOESN'T IT?

35:38.367 --> 35:39.538
SO THEN I'M SCREWED.

35:39.538 --> 35:40.709
AU CONTRAIRE.

35:40.709 --> 35:43.212
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO
THE POLICE SCANNER,

35:43.212 --> 35:45.914
THEY FOUND THE BLOODY HOODIE
WHEN THEY PICKED THE DIRTBAG UP.

35:45.914 --> 35:47.846
THE GRAYSONS CAN'T EXACTLY
ADMIT THEIR ASSOCIATION

35:47.846 --> 35:49.378
TO THE GUY,

35:49.378 --> 35:50.719
SO THEIR LAWYER'S

35:50.719 --> 35:52.381
GONNA HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE HE'S THE KILLER.

35:52.381 --> 35:53.852
YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'RE CAPABLE OF THAT?

35:53.852 --> 35:55.684
THEY HIRED THE GUY
TO BEAT YOU HALF TO DEATH,

35:55.684 --> 35:56.885
DIDN'T THEY?

35:56.885 --> 36:00.189
THE GRAYSONS
ARE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING

36:00.189 --> 36:03.332
WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING
THEIR FAMILY.

36:03.332 --> 36:06.465
HOW DID THEY EVEN KNOW
I HAD IT?

36:06.465 --> 36:08.637
YOU GUYS WERE
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE I TOLD.

36:08.637 --> 36:09.798
I...

36:09.798 --> 36:12.241
WELL, WHO KNOWS?

36:12.241 --> 36:15.244
MAYBE THE GUY
REALLY DID MURDER TYLER.

36:15.244 --> 36:18.947
MAYBE HE EVEN SAW YOU
ON THE BEACH THAT NIGHT.

36:18.947 --> 36:20.779
AT THIS POINT,

36:20.779 --> 36:22.951
I'D ADVISE AGAINST
DIGGING ANY DEEPER.

36:22.951 --> 36:25.514
TAKE THE WIN, JACK.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.588
(female voice)
This call will be recorded.

36:29.588 --> 36:30.889
You have
a collect call from...

36:30.889 --> 36:32.421
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

36:32.421 --> 36:34.263
at Rikers
Correctional Facility.

36:34.263 --> 36:36.625
To connect, press 5 now.

36:36.625 --> 36:39.528
(beeps)

36:39.528 --> 36:42.971
(Lee) We have a problem.

36:42.971 --> 36:44.673
I'M SORRY. WHO IS THIS?

36:44.673 --> 36:47.276
THEY FOUND
A BLOODY SWEATSHIRT IN MY CAR.

36:47.276 --> 36:48.577
THEY'RE SAYING
IT MATCHES THE BLOOD

36:48.577 --> 36:50.208
OF THE KID YOUR SON SHOT.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.380
WHAT?

36:51.380 --> 36:52.681
Did you set me up?

36:52.681 --> 36:53.982
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
I'M TAKING THE FALL

36:53.982 --> 36:55.384
FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO.

36:55.384 --> 36:57.916
STOP HARASSING ME.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.319
YOU WON'T GET A PENNY
FROM US.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.321
GET ME OUTTA THIS
OR GET READY, LADY.

37:02.321 --> 37:06.295
BECAUSE IF I'M GOING DOWN,
I'M TAKING YOU DOWN WITH ME,

37:06.295 --> 37:07.826
straight to hell
where you belong.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.928
YOU THREATEN ME
AND MY CHILDREN AGAIN,

37:09.928 --> 37:13.332
AND I WILL GO STRAIGHT
TO THE POLICE.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.304
(beep)

37:15.304 --> 37:17.606
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

37:19.468 --> 37:21.370
WE NEED TO CALL BROOKS.
 (beep)

37:21.370 --> 37:24.343
NO, YOU NEED
TO SPEAK TO ME FIRST.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.315
WHO WAS THAT?

37:28.417 --> 37:32.821
WHAT ON GOD'S EARTH
HAVE YOU DONE, VICTORIA?

37:41.530 --> 37:42.831
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

37:42.831 --> 37:44.363
YOU PAID A THUG TO HAVE
OUR SON BEATEN UP IN PRISON,

37:44.363 --> 37:46.365
AND THEN WHAT,
STRONG-ARM A JUROR,

37:46.365 --> 37:48.467
WHEN THIS GUY COULD'VE BEEN
THE VERY REASON

37:48.467 --> 37:51.300
DANIEL'S EVEN ON TRIAL
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

37:51.300 --> 37:53.402
LEE DIDN'T KILL TYLER.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

37:53.402 --> 37:54.803
HE WAS SET UP.

37:54.803 --> 37:56.345
OH.

37:56.345 --> 37:58.347
BY WHOM, FOR INSTANCE?

37:58.347 --> 37:59.478
JACK PORTER.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.810
HE KNEW WHAT LEE LOOKED LIKE.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.312
HE COULD'VE ORCHESTRATED
THE WHOLE THING

38:03.312 --> 38:04.653
TO PROTECT THE REAL KILLER.

38:04.653 --> 38:07.316
LET ME GUESS.
AMANDA CLARKE.

38:07.316 --> 38:08.957
(chuckles)

38:08.957 --> 38:12.361
YOU HAVE REALLY LOST IT,
YOU KNOW THAT?

38:12.361 --> 38:13.862
DID IT EVEN OCCUR TO YOU

38:13.862 --> 38:15.364
HOW MUCH YOU'VE RISKED
BOTH OUR LIVES

38:15.364 --> 38:16.995
AND DANIEL'S WITH THIS?

38:16.995 --> 38:20.499
I WILL CATEGORICALLY DENY
ANYTHING LEE HAS TO SAY.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.030
HE WAS BLACKMAILING US.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.333
WELL, THAT'S NOT
GONNA BE ENOUGH.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.804
ONCE THAT PUNK STARTS TALKING
TO SAVE HIS SKIN,

38:25.804 --> 38:27.506
IT'S GONNA
LEAD INVESTIGATORS

38:27.506 --> 38:29.408
ALL THE WAY DOWN
THE RABBIT HOLE

38:29.408 --> 38:32.310
TO US.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.983
LEAVE ME ALONE.
I NEED TO THINK.

38:34.983 --> 38:36.515
THIS WILL BE
SECOND MESS OF YOURS

38:36.515 --> 38:37.986
I'VE HAD TO CLEAN UP
IN ONE DAY.

38:37.986 --> 38:39.348
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

38:39.348 --> 38:40.419
I DON'T KNOW.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.790
WHY DON'T YOU GO
AND ASK YOUR ARTIST FRIEND?

38:41.790 --> 38:44.022
NOT THAT I EXPECT
YOU'LL FIND HIM.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.625
I MEAN, ONCE A FRAUD,
ALWAYS A FRAUD.

38:46.625 --> 38:47.956
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, VICTORIA?

38:47.956 --> 38:50.399
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HIM!

38:50.399 --> 38:51.560
(gasps)

38:51.560 --> 38:53.862
NO PROBLEM THERE.
HE'S LONG GONE BY NOW.

38:53.862 --> 38:56.665
OH, YOU... BASTARD.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.540
(beeps)

39:01.540 --> 39:03.372
(Daniel's voice)
"THE LAST TIME

39:03.372 --> 39:04.673
"I WROTE YOU FROM THIS PLACE,

39:04.673 --> 39:07.416
"I TOLD YOU I WAS INNOCENT.

39:07.416 --> 39:09.948
"THAT'S NOT REALLY
THE CASE.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.951
"I MAY NOT HAVE FIRED
THE SHOT THAT KILLED TYLER,

39:12.951 --> 39:15.424
BUT I DID SHOOT HIM..."

39:16.755 --> 39:18.657
"BECAUSE HE MADE ME
DOUBT YOU..."

39:21.460 --> 39:25.133
"BECAUSE HE SAID
YOU'D BETRAY ME.

39:25.133 --> 39:27.095
"BUT I'M THE ONE
WHO BETRAYED YOU.

39:27.095 --> 39:29.838
AND NOW I'M GETTING
WHAT I DESERVE."

39:33.442 --> 39:35.744
"WHICH IS WHY I'M GONNA
DO US BOTH A FAVOR

39:35.744 --> 39:38.447
AND END THIS NOW."

39:41.650 --> 39:43.412
(door clatters)

40:13.181 --> 40:15.143
OPEN 2-7-7!

40:15.143 --> 40:17.586
HOLY HELL.
 (alarm blaring)

40:17.586 --> 40:18.787
(clatters)

40:18.787 --> 40:20.449
(blaring continues)

40:20.449 --> 40:23.552
(guards speak indistinctly)

40:23.552 --> 40:27.095
(crying)

40:35.464 --> 40:36.705
(alarm blaring)

40:36.705 --> 40:38.066
(man)
THE CORONER'S BEEN NOTIFIED.

40:38.066 --> 40:39.568
C.S.I. ON THE WAY.
 (men shouting indistinctly)

40:39.568 --> 40:41.540
MR. BROOKS,
THANKS FOR COMING DOWN.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.771
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE?

40:42.771 --> 40:44.442
THEY'RE SAYING
SOMEONE HANGED HIMSELF.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.145
AND CONFESSED TO KILLING TYLER
IN A SUICIDE NOTE.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.477
WHAT?

40:48.477 --> 40:50.649
STILL WANT TO CHANGE
YOUR PLEA?

40:50.649 --> 40:52.821
(men continue
shouting indistinctly)

40:52.821 --> 40:54.983
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

40:54.983 --> 40:57.956
I'LL GET STARTED
GETTING YOUR CHARGES DROPPED.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.089
(blaring continues)

41:01.089 --> 41:05.664
(men continue
shouting indistinctly)

41:05.664 --> 41:07.636
(Emily)
JUSTICE, LIKE BEAUTY,

41:07.636 --> 41:09.898
IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.

41:09.898 --> 41:11.700
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES
HAVE CONFIRMED THE DEATH

41:11.700 --> 41:13.201
OF TERRORIST DAVID CLARKE,

41:13.201 --> 41:15.674
WHO WAS STABBED YESTERDAY
WHEN A FIGHT BROKE OUT...

41:15.674 --> 41:17.606
(Emily) SOME SEE
AN INNOCENT VICTIM.

41:17.606 --> 41:19.608
OTHERS SEE EVIL INCARNATE

41:19.608 --> 41:21.780
GETTING EXACTLY
WHAT'S DESERVED.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.512
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

41:23.512 --> 41:25.554
WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT HAPPENED?

41:25.554 --> 41:29.117
I WAS
WASTING MY TIME...

41:29.117 --> 41:33.622
GATHERING EVIDENCE
ON JURY TAMPERING WHEN...

41:33.622 --> 41:36.264
THE GRAYSONS HAVE
SO MUCH MORE TO PAY FOR.

41:36.264 --> 41:37.526
(clicks keyboard key)

41:37.526 --> 41:38.697
(Conrad)
SORRY TO HAVE PUT US

41:38.697 --> 41:40.699
IN THIS POSITION AGAIN,

41:40.699 --> 41:43.131
ESPECIALLY AFTER
ALL THESE YEARS.

41:43.131 --> 41:45.774
WE HAVE ANOTHER
DAVID CLARKE-STYLE SITUATION.

41:45.774 --> 41:47.005
(man)
That's very troubling news.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.176
THE NAME'S MORAN.

41:48.176 --> 41:49.608
WAIT. IS THAT CONRAD?
 LEE MORAN.

41:49.608 --> 41:50.679
WHAT...

41:50.679 --> 41:52.010
HE'S IN A HOLDING CELL
AT RIKERS.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.212
IF HE STARTS TALKING,

41:54.212 --> 41:57.646
I DON'T SEE HOW WE KEEP A LID
ON OUR ASSOCIATION.

41:57.646 --> 42:00.689
ALL OF THE RESEARCH
THAT I DID...

42:00.689 --> 42:03.051
EVERYBODY THAT I TALKED TO,
THEY SAID THAT...

42:03.051 --> 42:05.954
IT WAS JUST A PRISON FIGHT...

42:07.856 --> 42:11.259
THAT MY DAD WAS
KNIFED TO DEATH BY AN INMATE.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.735
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?

42:17.836 --> 42:21.139
THE GRAYSONS
MURDERED MY FATHER.
