00:04.885 --> 00:06.837
AVERY: Chapter one of
my presidential memoir.

00:06.837 --> 00:09.300
Today, my journey begins
to become the youngest,

00:09.300 --> 00:13.224
shortest, blondest female
president since Buchanan!

00:13.224 --> 00:15.556
( laughs )

00:15.556 --> 00:17.438
Always open
with a joke.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.353
Tomorrow I launch my first
major election campaign,

00:22.353 --> 00:24.445
as I run for class president.

00:24.445 --> 00:26.317
What a coincidence!

00:26.317 --> 00:29.990
Because tomorrow I start
a your campaign manager.

00:29.990 --> 00:32.113
What are the odds?

00:32.113 --> 00:34.455
Now, can you give me
a turn on the computer?

00:34.455 --> 00:37.868
I have a very important
blog to write as your
campaign manager.

00:37.868 --> 00:41.542
Stan, we discussed this.
You're not my
campaign manager.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.874
Fine, I'm not.

00:43.874 --> 00:48.169
STAN: I'm so excited to be
named Avery's campaign manager.

00:48.169 --> 00:50.881
Clearly, she needs
help with the way the
press is hounding her.

00:50.881 --> 00:53.554
What press?
They're always watching.

00:56.517 --> 01:01.021
But they're not always
this adorable.
Look at his little camera!

01:20.291 --> 01:22.373
I got this.
I got one.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.295
Thanks you guys.
I can get the rest

01:24.295 --> 01:26.417
of the stuff from
the campaign bus myself.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.709
Avery, it's not a campaign bus,
it's a little red wagon

01:28.709 --> 01:30.471
pulled by your dog.

01:35.306 --> 01:38.018
It was either this or make him
my campaign manager.

01:38.018 --> 01:41.482
( laughs )

01:41.482 --> 01:44.685
So, I can't wait to find
out who my opponent is.

01:44.685 --> 01:47.438
Who I will graciously mention
in my victory speech

01:47.438 --> 01:49.610
before the balloons
drop from the ceiling.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.533
Oh, I've always wanted balloons
to drop from the ceiling.

01:52.533 --> 01:56.697
Keep blowing, Wyatt!

01:56.697 --> 01:58.869
Actually, you don't
have an opponent.

01:58.869 --> 02:01.162
Everybody knows you'll win, so
no one's running against you.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.544
What? This is terrible.

02:03.544 --> 02:06.507
Yes, success just falls
in your lap, how awful.

02:06.507 --> 02:09.049
You don't understand.
If I win with no one

02:09.049 --> 02:11.922
running against me the
balloons will just seem smug.

02:11.922 --> 02:16.757
I didn't say stop
blowing, Wyatt!

02:16.757 --> 02:20.060
Does he do balloon animals?
If he does, my next question

02:20.060 --> 02:22.393
is does he have
a girlfriend?

02:22.393 --> 02:28.859
Guys, if I run unopposed,
who will I debate?
Myself?

02:28.859 --> 02:32.363
We need more computers
in the library!
I agree entirely.

02:32.363 --> 02:34.445
I also think that
top is super cute.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.617
Right back at you about
that top, pretty lady!

02:38.449 --> 02:41.081
See? It won't
be a real campaign.

02:41.081 --> 02:43.284
And victory
will be meaningless.

02:44.995 --> 02:46.547
Max?

02:46.547 --> 02:48.839
Would you do me
a huge favor,

02:48.839 --> 02:51.962
and run against me?
Max? Why didn't
you ask me?

02:51.962 --> 02:53.964
You always said you'd
never run for election

02:53.964 --> 02:55.386
because you didn't want to
throw your hat in the ring.

02:55.386 --> 02:58.889
That expression has
always bothered me.

02:58.889 --> 03:02.933
Besides, you might care if you
lost, I know Max won't care.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.566
She's right.
I don't care.
I'll do it.

03:05.566 --> 03:10.070
In fact, my campaign
slogan will be:
"One student, one voice."

03:10.070 --> 03:12.693
Kidding.
It's "I don't care."

03:12.693 --> 03:15.526
Max, that's perfect.

03:15.526 --> 03:18.869
Oh, a heart balloon
with a note attached.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.162
"Help me."

03:22.162 --> 03:23.954
Nice try, Wyatt.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.327
( sound of balloon popping )

03:26.327 --> 03:27.668
Back to work.

03:32.002 --> 03:35.135
I'm home.
ALL: Hey buddy!

03:35.135 --> 03:38.299
Good to have you back.
The BMX tour
was awesome.

03:38.299 --> 03:40.220
I got something
for everybody.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.894
Chloe? This is a medal
that I won.
Awesome!

03:43.894 --> 03:46.977
Dad, here's a team hat.
And Mom, just for you...

03:46.977 --> 03:51.522
Oh, it is so sweet.
Three bags of
mud-stained laundry.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.233
You left with one bag
of clothes.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.566
Ellis and Skidmark needed
their clothes washed too.

03:55.566 --> 03:59.450
Skidmark's not his real name,
it's Samuel K. Wydmark.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.701
Plus, he's a lazy wiper.

04:02.453 --> 04:05.205
Tyler, I've missed
you so much.

04:05.205 --> 04:06.827
You're gone every
few days now.

04:06.827 --> 04:10.080
And every few days,
the house is quiet,

04:10.080 --> 04:13.334
clean, and doesn't smell like
tropical breeze body spray.

04:13.334 --> 04:15.135
I wonder if there's
a connection.

04:18.879 --> 04:21.011
Check this out.
On the tour, I learned how

04:21.011 --> 04:22.883
to make chocolate milk
in my mouth.

04:29.350 --> 04:30.691
( gargles )

04:32.272 --> 04:34.695
For you, Mom.

04:34.695 --> 04:37.528
My buddy Red makes them
for all the guys.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.450
This is disgusting.

04:39.450 --> 04:40.661
And it's not even
a full cup!

04:42.493 --> 04:44.495
I'm sorry you didn't
get anything good, Mommy.

04:44.495 --> 04:47.868
I would give you my medal,
but then I wouldn't have it.

04:47.868 --> 04:49.460
You understand!

04:51.542 --> 04:54.294
Okay, Tyler, you're going
to help me wash these clothes.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.717
And you're also going
to get me something
nicer than laundry

04:56.717 --> 04:58.759
and mouth milk.

04:58.759 --> 05:00.921
Did you even put
your bike away,

05:00.921 --> 05:03.053
or did you just leave it
lying in the driveway again?

05:03.053 --> 05:05.015
Before you left, your mother
almost backed over it.

05:05.015 --> 05:07.057
Yes, and I would have
if it wasn't for a man

05:07.057 --> 05:09.560
calling out, "Stop!"
Strange I didn't see

05:09.560 --> 05:12.483
the man it was just Stan
in the rear-view mirror.

05:12.483 --> 05:14.855
Guys,
I'm a responsible adult now,

05:14.855 --> 05:17.648
I'd never let something
happen to my bike.

05:17.648 --> 05:19.740
Something happened to my bike!

05:19.740 --> 05:22.743
What do you mean?
It's gone, someone must
have stolen it.

05:22.743 --> 05:25.616
I didn't steal it,
I only borrowed it.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.368
You borrowed my bike?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.410
No! Your tropical wind
body spray.

05:29.410 --> 05:31.161
What happened to your bike?

05:35.165 --> 05:38.218
Max, everyone is wearing
your "I don't care" slogan.

05:38.218 --> 05:40.300
What's going on?
I thought you

05:40.300 --> 05:42.222
didn't care about
the election?
I don't care.

05:42.222 --> 05:44.385
STUDENTS: I don't care!
I don't care!

05:44.385 --> 05:45.766
I don't care!

05:45.766 --> 05:49.179
I've tapped into
a deep vein of "meh."

05:49.179 --> 05:51.061
Well, why aren't you
wearing a button?

05:51.061 --> 05:52.433
I don't care.

05:54.525 --> 05:57.898
Hey, everybody!
If you do want something

05:57.898 --> 06:01.402
to care about,
why don't you vote for...

06:01.402 --> 06:04.364
a very good candidate?
( laughs )

06:05.696 --> 06:09.790
A very, Avery.
A very, Avery.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.622
See, it's a pun
on my name.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.584
Oh, that's good.
It's complicated
without being funny.

06:15.756 --> 06:17.708
ALL: I don't care!
I don't care!

06:17.708 --> 06:20.501
ALL: I don't care!
I don't care!

06:20.501 --> 06:22.883
Max's campaign
is really catching on.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.925
What if I lose?

06:24.925 --> 06:26.767
Look, all the different
cliques are gathered
around her:

06:26.767 --> 06:29.309
The jocks, the nerds,
the theater kids.

06:29.309 --> 06:31.351
Even the group of guys
who dress up like unicorns.

06:31.351 --> 06:34.144
ALL:
( neighing )

06:34.144 --> 06:38.899
How did she become
so popular with
the Dude-icorns?

06:38.899 --> 06:42.523
They're the school's
most elusive
and mythical voters.

06:48.118 --> 06:50.240
My election polls are
a little imprecise,
but they indicate

06:50.240 --> 06:52.703
that you're losing
to Max by 10%.

06:52.703 --> 06:56.957
Or maybe 30%.
Or maybe winning by 10%.

06:56.957 --> 06:59.800
I did say they were
a little imprecise.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.093
Stan, you're not
my campaign manager.

07:03.093 --> 07:06.216
Which is why you're
behind in the polls!

07:06.216 --> 07:08.428
Unless you're really ahead.

07:08.428 --> 07:12.102
I just don't see how
some joke campaign
about not caring

07:12.102 --> 07:16.106
could be beating my very
serious campaign about wanting
to improve the school.

07:16.106 --> 07:18.819
Don't worry, I'm on it.
I have time now.

07:18.819 --> 07:21.902
My wife Princess is on
the road doing dog shows.

07:21.902 --> 07:25.235
We're America's number one
canine power couple.

07:25.235 --> 07:28.949
They're calling us
Stan-cess.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.662
Whose calling you that?
Well, so far just
me and Robert.

07:31.662 --> 07:33.243
But that's how things
get started.

07:33.243 --> 07:35.786
We're also bring back
harem pants.

07:38.879 --> 07:41.672
Anywho, I've made
a campaign video
that will

07:41.672 --> 07:44.254
turn the tide for you.

07:44.254 --> 07:46.757
STAN: Max's slogan is,
"I don't care."

07:46.757 --> 07:49.760
You know who else
doesn't care? Cats.

07:51.391 --> 07:54.975
That's right,
Max is a cat.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.767
She goes potty in sand.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.900
Don't invite her
to your beach party.

07:59.900 --> 08:04.194
She plays with yarn.
Oh, that's really cute.

08:04.194 --> 08:06.947
Or is it?

08:06.947 --> 08:11.822
Eww! She's got fleas.

08:11.822 --> 08:14.705
Do you really want your next
president to be...

08:15.826 --> 08:18.999
Fleabag Max?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.171
Not necessarily based in any
truth whatsoever.

08:21.171 --> 08:23.383
Claims in this ad may very
or extremely exaggerated.

08:23.383 --> 08:25.716
My name is Avery Jennings
and I approve this message.

08:25.716 --> 08:29.219
Which is also not true.

08:29.219 --> 08:33.013
Let's put aside
for a moment that
that video is crazy.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.726
I am not going to run
a negative campaign.

08:35.726 --> 08:39.309
Max is my friend.
The only reason she's running
is because I asked her to.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.521
Then you should ask
her to drop out.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.483
That's actually
a good idea.

08:43.483 --> 08:45.816
I'm full of good ideas,
Avery.

08:45.816 --> 08:49.489
Check out the video Robert
and I made to promote
our harem pants.

08:49.489 --> 08:55.616
STAN:
( humming dance tune )

08:58.498 --> 09:01.712
I've looked everywhere
for my bike and nothing.

09:01.712 --> 09:04.084
So I'm going to need
to borrow money from

09:04.084 --> 09:06.717
you guys so I can get
a new bike before
the next competition.

09:06.717 --> 09:08.969
Well, what happened to
all the money you've been
making on the BMX circuit?

09:08.969 --> 09:11.722
I swear I didn't waste
a penny of it.

09:11.722 --> 09:15.766
No way I'm a waste of money.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.852
This is ridiculous, Tyler, you
have to be more responsible.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.524
Honey, you don't clean up
after yourself,

09:24.524 --> 09:26.777
you lose your bike,
and you're wasting your money,

09:26.777 --> 09:28.609
some of which you could have
spent on a present

09:28.609 --> 09:32.322
for your mother that wasn't
made in your mouth.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.786
Come on, Mommy and Daddy,
Tyler's a really great brother.

09:35.786 --> 09:38.789
Everybody makes mistakes.
Haven't you ever lost something

09:38.789 --> 09:41.371
really important
and really red-headed

09:41.371 --> 09:43.754
at the mall when she
was five?

09:43.754 --> 09:46.376
I was hoping that memory
wouldn't take.

09:46.376 --> 09:49.630
Forgive, but never forget.

09:49.630 --> 09:56.346
That's what I say
about the man who put
the robot inside of me.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.219
Actually, Tyler, you could
learn from Chloe.

09:59.219 --> 10:01.982
Now she gets
a dollar every week
for doing chores

10:01.982 --> 10:04.985
and she saves it all.
How much do you
have now, sweetheart?

10:04.985 --> 10:07.277
$450.
What?

10:07.277 --> 10:09.399
How'd you get
that much money?

10:09.399 --> 10:11.441
I sell mice to
the pet store as
friends for the snakes.

10:11.441 --> 10:15.075
Oh, sweetie.
Snakes eat mice.

10:15.075 --> 10:18.038
Really?
I didn't know that.

10:18.038 --> 10:22.703
Well, business is business
and business is booming.

10:22.703 --> 10:25.585
Please, if you loan me
$300 to get a new bike,

10:25.585 --> 10:27.708
I promise
I'll pay you back.
Okay, but you have

10:27.708 --> 10:29.209
to pay us back before
you spend that money

10:29.209 --> 10:31.421
on anything frivolous.

10:31.421 --> 10:35.515
That's right, Tyler.
No more throwing away
money on stupid things.

10:35.515 --> 10:38.178
( laughs )
This is great!

10:43.063 --> 10:46.026
Hey, Max. I really
appreciate you running,

10:46.026 --> 10:48.438
but I was thinking now
would be a good time
for you to bow out.

10:48.438 --> 10:51.942
Because I'm winning?
Glad you understand!

10:51.942 --> 10:54.324
No, Avery.
I'm going to be
class president.

10:54.324 --> 10:56.326
I'm not dropping out.
What?

10:56.326 --> 10:58.038
You don't even care.

10:58.038 --> 11:00.911
Well, true, that's been
my life's motto,

11:00.911 --> 11:03.914
but now I'm a high school
kid getting a lot of positive
attention from my peers,

11:03.914 --> 11:07.047
so I'm going to ride
that train for a while.

11:07.047 --> 11:11.051
Max, I asked you to run
as a favor, you're my friend.

11:11.051 --> 11:12.843
You should know how
much this means to me.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.424
Well, if our friendship
mattered to you,

11:14.424 --> 11:15.886
you'd understand that
for the first time,

11:15.886 --> 11:17.928
I'm kind of a big deal.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.600
STUDENTS: I don't care!
I don't care! I don't care!

11:20.600 --> 11:22.392
Yeah, you don't.

11:28.809 --> 11:30.570
Hey, Chloe, I just
got a new bike.

11:30.570 --> 11:33.403
Totally customized.
Even got a bell.

11:33.403 --> 11:34.905
So, when I'm
getting mad air,

11:34.905 --> 11:38.989
I'll be all like,
phew, bling, bling!

11:38.989 --> 11:41.031
So, you're going
back on tour?

11:41.031 --> 11:44.664
Yeah, and, honestly,
and I don't Mom and Dad
Would have lent me

11:44.664 --> 11:46.827
the money if you hadn't
stood up for me.

11:46.827 --> 11:48.959
You're a great sister.
Nothing says thank you
like a smoothie.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.751
I'll make you one.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.333
Not in your mouth!

11:53.333 --> 11:55.385
I shouldn't have to say that.

12:02.763 --> 12:06.106
Chloe, you sly taco!

12:14.524 --> 12:16.066
Hey, Chloe, come check
out my new bike.

12:16.066 --> 12:19.239
Sure, Tyler, that would
be very interesting.

12:21.862 --> 12:24.454
Check this out.

12:24.454 --> 12:28.538
My bike! Where is
my bike? I just left
it here for a second.

12:28.538 --> 12:30.080
Someone took it
right out our backyard.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.501
Mom, Dad!

12:31.501 --> 12:33.874
Are you sure it
was out here?

12:36.376 --> 12:38.718
You guys,
Someone stole my bike!

12:38.718 --> 12:40.931
The bike you just bought?
You already lost it?

12:40.931 --> 12:43.473
Don't you remember
what the bear said?

12:43.473 --> 12:46.186
You have to be
more responsible.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.190
Tyler, we are out $300.

12:50.190 --> 12:54.314
No, now you're out $600
'cause you have to loan
me $300 to get another bike.

12:54.314 --> 12:57.818
Man, this is a nightmare
for all of us.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.401
You expect us to buy
you another bike after
you just lost two?

13:01.401 --> 13:04.114
Oh, good. You understand.
I thought we were
going to have

13:04.114 --> 13:08.038
a whole to-do about this.
I think I'm going to get
a blue one next.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.460
We are not going to keep
buying you bikes

13:10.460 --> 13:12.122
if you're going
to keep losing them.

13:12.122 --> 13:14.124
Why would we throw good
money after bad?

13:14.124 --> 13:16.586
That's the sunk-cost fallacy!

13:16.586 --> 13:20.050
I learned that on
a money show I watch
for my mouse business.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.422
It's called
Screaming About Stocks

13:22.422 --> 13:25.635
with a guy who
screams about stocks!

13:27.888 --> 13:30.891
Look, I'm not losing the bikes,
somebody keeps taking them.

13:30.891 --> 13:34.064
Please, I promise
I won't let this next
bike out of my sight.

13:34.064 --> 13:38.318
If anything happens to it,
I'll quit BMX and get
regular job to pay you back.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.241
What kind of regular job?
Uh...

13:41.241 --> 13:45.245
Try technology!
It's going through the roof!

13:48.408 --> 13:51.211
I can't believe Max isn't
going to drop out!

13:51.211 --> 13:54.164
If she wants a fight,
I'll give her a fight.

13:54.164 --> 13:56.416
A very good fight.

13:56.416 --> 13:58.418
AVERY:
( laughs )

13:58.418 --> 14:02.842
Come on!
Avery, a very?
Someone has to get that!

14:02.842 --> 14:05.225
So, if I'm understanding
you correctly,

14:05.225 --> 14:08.098
we are going wide
with the Fleabag Max video.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.560
I already made the plushie.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.644
Stan, why do you
keep making plushies?

14:14.644 --> 14:16.937
I'd have thought
you learned your
lesson from this.

14:19.779 --> 14:22.782
Or these?

14:22.782 --> 14:26.366
Why don't stores
want those?
They're adorable!

14:26.366 --> 14:31.041
And they're not
even radioactive
like the first batch.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.163
So, about that cat video?

14:33.163 --> 14:36.796
Stan, the cat video
is not a serious
political statement.

14:36.796 --> 14:39.169
It's just a joke.

14:39.169 --> 14:43.303
And a joke is exactly
what I need.

14:43.303 --> 14:45.385
Max is running
a joke campaign,

14:45.385 --> 14:50.270
and everyone loves it.
If I do show your
Fleabag Max video

14:50.270 --> 14:53.273
People will think
I'm funny and it will
make Max look ridiculous.

14:53.273 --> 14:55.185
And you know what else
will win you votes?

14:55.185 --> 14:56.816
Hand these out:

14:56.816 --> 14:58.228
DOLL:
There's the sugar!

14:58.228 --> 15:00.360
You see that?
It talks.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.283
It has an electronic
voice box just like me.

15:03.283 --> 15:06.906
Naw, I'm kidding.
I'm a regular talking dog.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.165
Thanks for letting
me be part of
your stake-out, Tyler.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.377
This is pretty cool.
I just hope we
catch the thief.

15:17.377 --> 15:20.460
Mom and Dad will see
that I wasn't just
being irresponsible.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.132
At least not
the second time.

15:22.132 --> 15:23.803
I'm still not sure
about the first bike.

15:23.803 --> 15:26.546
I am pretty irresponsible.

15:26.546 --> 15:29.309
Feel free to take
a nap while I keep watch.

15:29.309 --> 15:31.551
Thanks, but we're out
here for an important reason.

15:31.551 --> 15:35.605
Look what I found
stowed away in a box
in the garage.

15:35.605 --> 15:38.728
Blankie!

15:38.728 --> 15:40.770
Oh, Blankie.

15:50.620 --> 15:55.575
No! Chloe wake up!
We missed it,
someone stole my bike!

15:55.575 --> 15:58.288
Tyler, how could this
happen again?

15:58.288 --> 16:02.712
And again! And again!

16:02.712 --> 16:05.255
Mom and Dad are
gonna freak!

16:05.255 --> 16:07.387
Oh, no!

16:07.387 --> 16:10.050
It's okay, I rigged
the bike with blue dye,

16:10.050 --> 16:11.851
so whoever took it
will have blue hands.

16:16.896 --> 16:19.479
Tyler, we will those
blue-handed people,

16:19.479 --> 16:23.483
whoever they are.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.276
Chloe, you took
my bike?

16:26.276 --> 16:29.489
( laughing )
That is, I mean are you...

16:29.489 --> 16:33.913
Oh, Tyler.
Yes.

16:33.913 --> 16:35.245
They're in my room.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.707
You took my other bikes,
too?

16:37.707 --> 16:39.209
Why would you do
this to me?

16:39.209 --> 16:41.461
I put my whole BMX
career on the line.

16:41.461 --> 16:44.384
I don't want you
to do BMX.

16:44.384 --> 16:46.336
You keep leaving
all the time.

16:46.336 --> 16:50.220
You're my big brother.
We used to do
so much together.

16:50.220 --> 16:54.304
You got my ears pierced.
You taught my how to
make mouth milk.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.346
I probably won't use
that one, but I know it.

16:58.438 --> 17:00.400
I miss you.

17:04.354 --> 17:07.317
Chloe. I'm getting
to be an adult now,

17:07.317 --> 17:09.649
and I'm chasing
my dreams.

17:09.649 --> 17:12.322
And one day,
you will, too.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.454
I will always
be close.

17:14.454 --> 17:16.656
You're my little sister.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.160
I love you.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.961
I love you, too.

17:21.961 --> 17:23.423
Sorry about your shirt.

17:26.466 --> 17:29.669
Hey, how come Mom
didn't find the bikes when
she cleaned your room?

17:29.669 --> 17:31.881
I'm going to
vacuum your room.

17:31.881 --> 17:34.384
Okay, let me know
if you find the snake
that escaped.

17:34.384 --> 17:36.346
It's been eating
all my mice.
Maybe later.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.887
Maybe later.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.394
( laughing )
COMPUTER: And I
approve this message.

17:44.394 --> 17:45.985
Which is also not true.

17:45.985 --> 17:48.238
So, when the debate
starts, I'll queue you

17:48.238 --> 17:50.990
and you'll play
this Fleabag Max video
through the projector.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.693
Avery, I can't play that!
I mean, it's hilarious.

17:53.693 --> 17:55.115
She's gonna poop
on the beach?

17:55.115 --> 17:56.456
( laughing )

17:56.456 --> 17:58.458
But, it'll humiliate her.

17:58.458 --> 18:00.250
( laughs )
But, it's funny.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.332
Don't you remember
what happened
to Timmy Sperlock?

18:02.332 --> 18:04.294
One day he wore a black
and white sweater
to school and now

18:04.294 --> 18:07.507
everyone calls him
Skunk Boy.
He sits alone at lunch.

18:07.507 --> 18:10.089
Partly because
he's a jerk.
Yeah, but still.

18:11.761 --> 18:14.013
Max will be fine.
No, people latch on

18:14.013 --> 18:17.217
to one little thing
and you're stuck with it
for the next four years.

18:17.217 --> 18:19.559
Do you want people
calling her Fleabag Max?

18:19.559 --> 18:22.482
She's your friend.

18:22.482 --> 18:26.105
She's not my friend.
She's my competitor.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.817
Oh, Avery.

18:32.782 --> 18:33.993
( sighing )

18:37.407 --> 18:42.582
Faculty, fellow students,
and those of you who just
wanted to ditch fifth period,

18:42.582 --> 18:45.375
What?
( laughs )

18:45.375 --> 18:47.507
Always open with a joke.

18:47.507 --> 18:51.421
DOLLS:
There's the sugar!

18:51.421 --> 18:54.844
Stan, do not pass those out
in the middle of my speech.

18:59.969 --> 19:02.472
Now, in lieu of my
introductory remarks,

19:02.472 --> 19:04.684
I would like to play
this video.

19:15.235 --> 19:17.737
But I can't.

19:19.699 --> 19:22.452
I decided to run for office
to start on my path

19:22.452 --> 19:26.125
to helping people
and making a difference.

19:26.125 --> 19:28.628
But I almost did something
really horrible.

19:28.628 --> 19:33.052
I wanted to win the election
so much that I lost myself,

19:33.052 --> 19:37.096
and I almost lost my friend.

19:37.096 --> 19:42.472
Max, I am so, so, sorry that
I asked you to drop out.

19:42.472 --> 19:47.517
You have as much right
to run as I do.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.269
Fellow students.

19:49.269 --> 19:52.692
ALL: I don't care!
I don't care!

19:54.694 --> 19:58.368
I have a confession to make.
I do care.

19:58.368 --> 20:01.411
( gasps )

20:01.411 --> 20:06.085
I care about Avery.
I am so sorry Avery.

20:06.085 --> 20:07.497
You asked me to do you
a favor and I got

20:07.497 --> 20:11.130
so carried away
with the attention.

20:11.130 --> 20:15.505
I mean, I am an honorary Dude-
icorn now. How cool is that?

20:17.467 --> 20:21.010
But the point is, I lost sight
of what's important.

20:21.010 --> 20:22.972
Your friendship.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.519
I don't even want
to vote against you.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.190
So, I'm just not
going to vote.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.353
I'm not going to
vote against you either.

20:36.356 --> 20:39.319
Hey, where'd everybody go?
They got bored
by your long,

20:39.319 --> 20:40.950
mushy speeches
and left.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.995
So, nobody voted?
Well, I did.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.748
You're the only vote?
I didn't know that
at the time.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.331
Who'd you vote for?
I couldn't choose
between you two,

20:51.331 --> 20:52.792
so I just wrote
in my name.

20:52.792 --> 20:56.426
BOTH:
You're the class president?

20:56.426 --> 20:58.968
I guess so. I don't how
to be president,

20:58.968 --> 21:00.970
but I will take it
seriously and work really...

21:00.970 --> 21:03.052
Oh, balloons!

21:07.437 --> 21:09.939
I guess we get the
government we deserve.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.654
AVERY: Losing this election
makes for a great first

21:14.654 --> 21:17.487
chapter in my memoir,
since I learned the important

21:17.487 --> 21:19.108
lesson that what kind
of person you are

21:19.108 --> 21:21.491
matters more than winning.

21:21.491 --> 21:23.613
I also learned that I look
great in harem pants.

21:26.746 --> 21:28.958
And...
( singing )

21:32.372 --> 21:34.544
( singing stops )

21:34.544 --> 21:38.548
STAN: So, I finally
sold my first pair
of harem pants.

21:38.548 --> 21:43.052
And my stint as
a campaign manager
was a huge success.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.515
We only lost
by one vote.

21:48.558 --> 21:51.310
Chloe, it is not okay
to steal.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.733
Even if you are doing
it out of love.

21:53.733 --> 21:55.855
Tyler can't return those
new custom bikes,

21:55.855 --> 21:57.316
so you're going to have
to pay for them out

21:57.316 --> 21:58.698
of your mouse money.

21:58.698 --> 22:00.400
It's not just mice,
anymore.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.653
I'm expanding my business.
I've got lizards, spiders,

22:03.653 --> 22:05.575
and one turkey vulture.

22:05.575 --> 22:09.659
I really got to shut
my window at night.

22:09.659 --> 22:12.712
I am never vacuuming
your room again.

22:12.712 --> 22:16.456
You know what, Chloe's been
a really good sister.

22:16.456 --> 22:18.087
I'm paying for half of it.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.629
Where are you getting
the money, Tyler?

22:19.629 --> 22:22.171
Well, I decided to sell
my animatronic bear.

22:22.171 --> 22:23.843
Who'd you sell it to?

22:23.843 --> 22:26.636
Hello, there, Stan,
how are you?

22:26.636 --> 22:28.888
( laughs )

22:28.888 --> 22:31.601
Why are talking animals
so funny?

22:31.601 --> 22:33.473
( laughing )
