to his black jacket
team, made up of three

00:13.772 --> 00:15.498
veterans and two rookies--

00:15.601 --> 00:17.914
I'm pretty sure that
I need to pay attention

00:18.018 --> 00:21.400
because everything happens fora reason here in Hell's Kitchen.

00:21.504 --> 00:22.815
NARRATOR: --Chef
Ramsay challenged

00:22.919 --> 00:26.371
the chefs to recreate the EggsBenedict they were just served.

00:26.474 --> 00:27.303
GORDON RAMSAY: That's right.

00:27.406 --> 00:29.615
Taste it, now make it.

00:29.719 --> 00:31.272
I'm feeling
confident right now.

00:31.376 --> 00:33.067
I'm going to go from
memory at this point.

00:33.171 --> 00:34.724
NARRATOR: Rookie
Motto went on memory

00:34.827 --> 00:36.484
and chose the wrong protein.

00:36.588 --> 00:38.072
MOTTO: I picked
prosciutto, Chef.

00:38.176 --> 00:39.970

00:42.145 --> 00:43.319

NARRATOR: --and Ariel and Miaboth flirted with perfection--

00:48.220 --> 00:49.014

Let me tell you.

NARRATOR: --correctly
identifying the same

00:51.430 --> 00:52.569
number of ingredients--

00:54.537 --> 00:55.745

NARRATOR: At dinner service--

01:00.439 --> 01:01.268
Heather?

01:01.371 --> 01:02.234
Heather, where are you?

01:02.338 --> 01:03.132
Heather?

01:03.235 --> 01:04.064

NARRATOR: --what started asa communication problem--

01:07.515 --> 01:10.104

01:13.142 --> 01:14.488
GORDON RAMSAY: How long, Bret?

01:14.591 --> 01:16.041
Don't put your fucking
head down like that.

01:16.145 --> 01:18.733
I told you start
talking-- fucking do it.

01:18.837 --> 01:20.321
NARRATOR: --until
Heather was completely

01:20.425 --> 01:22.185
submerged on the fish station--

01:22.289 --> 01:24.325
I need two minutes inthe oven for the halibut.

01:24.429 --> 01:25.706
Please listen to me.

01:25.809 --> 01:28.398
I'm being made to look likea fucking imbecile right now.

01:28.502 --> 01:30.469
NARRATOR: --and needed
Motto to bail her out.

01:30.573 --> 01:31.505
Can somebody help me?

01:31.608 --> 01:32.989
I need to re-fire salmon.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.197
What you want
me to [inaudible]??

01:34.301 --> 01:35.543
GORDON RAMSAY: And who
cooked this salmon here?

01:35.647 --> 01:36.406
- I did.
- I don't know.

01:36.510 --> 01:38.650
Nicely cooked.

01:38.753 --> 01:40.065
NARRATOR: The team nominated--

01:40.169 --> 01:41.066
BRET: I know who my votes are.

01:41.170 --> 01:42.447
It's Heather and Mia.

01:42.550 --> 01:45.277
You do great in challenges,but you can't burn on the line.

01:45.381 --> 01:46.209
Yeah, I fucking can.

01:46.313 --> 01:47.486
I'm pissed.

01:47.590 --> 01:49.764
I don't think I should begoing up for elimination.

01:49.868 --> 01:52.181
NARRATOR: With Mia andHeather on the chopping block,

01:52.284 --> 01:55.425
Chef Ramsay decided it
was time to send home--

01:55.529 --> 01:56.737
Heather.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.084
NARRATOR: --ending therunner-up from Season 16's dream

01:59.188 --> 02:01.431
of becoming the
executive chef at Gordon

02:01.535 --> 02:03.157
Ramsay's Hell's
Kitchen restaurant

02:03.261 --> 02:06.609
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

02:06.712 --> 02:09.715
And now the continuation
of "Hell's Kitchen."

02:09.819 --> 02:11.338
Get out of here.

02:11.441 --> 02:12.891
Bret's looking
out for himself,

02:12.994 --> 02:15.583
and he'll say anything that'llkeep him in the competition.

02:15.687 --> 02:16.481
And that's fine.

02:16.584 --> 02:18.310
Final four, yo.

02:18.414 --> 02:20.140
But if I would have
gone home tonight,

02:20.243 --> 02:21.693
it would have been bullshit.

02:21.796 --> 02:24.627
Don't form an opinion on mebased on what you've heard.

02:24.730 --> 02:26.146
See it for yourself.

02:26.249 --> 02:27.561
- One dinner service.
- Yeah.

02:27.664 --> 02:29.287
All right, and the
both of ya's fucked up.

02:29.390 --> 02:31.703
From what I hear, a bunch ofthings from everybody else,

02:31.806 --> 02:32.738
I can only assume.

02:32.842 --> 02:33.946
But you've never
worked with me.

02:34.050 --> 02:35.085
This is your first time.- You're absolutely right.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.190
Absolutely right.

02:36.294 --> 02:37.640
That's why I said, based
on what I've heard.

02:37.743 --> 02:38.744
- I got it.- You know what I'm saying?

02:38.848 --> 02:39.883
But I was talking
to you, dude.

02:39.987 --> 02:41.506
You can't say I wasn't
fucking talking to you.

02:41.609 --> 02:44.198
Why do you think I'm
top four right now?

02:44.302 --> 02:47.097
I can cook, but when I'mworking with a bunch of you

02:47.201 --> 02:50.791
yee-ha's that can't talk itmakes it really hard for me.

02:50.894 --> 02:52.517
I had a lot to fucking do and--

02:52.620 --> 02:53.828
- We all do.
- That's fine.

02:53.932 --> 02:54.726
It's fine.

02:54.829 --> 02:56.037
We all-- we all do.

02:56.141 --> 02:58.074
I feel like Mia's the weakestchef in this competition

02:58.178 --> 02:59.420
right now.

02:59.524 --> 03:01.250
Let her stay in her fancy littleprivate chef life in Miami

03:01.353 --> 03:04.287
and do her little one
plate in 45 minutes.

03:04.391 --> 03:06.358
She doesn't have what it takes.

03:06.462 --> 03:07.670
Now it's, you
know, time to burn.

03:07.773 --> 03:08.567
That's fine.

03:08.671 --> 03:09.465
It's over.

03:12.157 --> 03:14.987
[howling]

03:15.091 --> 03:18.646
[phone ringing]

03:18.750 --> 03:19.889
Hi, this is Mia.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.892
Mia, I need to see allof you in the dining room

03:22.995 --> 03:24.100

03:24.204 --> 03:24.997
MIA [ON PHONE]: Yes, chef.

03:25.101 --> 03:25.964

03:26.067 --> 03:27.552

03:27.655 --> 03:28.484

03:28.587 --> 03:30.520
I knew it.

03:30.624 --> 03:31.418
What the fuck.

03:31.521 --> 03:33.903
What the fuck is going on here?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.456
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.768
Come on down, please.

03:36.871 --> 03:37.769
BRET: Like, does he not sleep?

03:37.872 --> 03:39.046
Is he a robot?

03:39.149 --> 03:40.737
Like, you should go homeand get some rest too, chef.

03:40.841 --> 03:42.739
Now, seeing as you
are the final four,

03:42.843 --> 03:46.881
I thought would end theday with a midnight snack.

03:46.985 --> 03:48.607
Oh, shit.

03:48.711 --> 03:50.713
Pancakes.

03:50.816 --> 03:51.955

04:03.035 --> 04:03.864

04:03.967 --> 04:05.037

ARIEL: Lo and behold, it
is a phenomenal portrait

04:08.869 --> 04:10.146

04:10.250 --> 04:12.113
The hair is perfect.

04:12.217 --> 04:14.840
He's got blue,
bright eyes, and he's

04:14.944 --> 04:16.911
looking great as a pancake.

04:17.015 --> 04:20.294
Now, Dan has been busy

07:55.958 --> 07:57.856
dropped the whole table over.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.273
[ominous music]

08:01.377 --> 08:02.585
Don't drop it on
me, please, Motto.

08:02.689 --> 08:03.517
- I will not.
- Getting nervous.

08:03.621 --> 08:04.932
I promise you that.

08:05.036 --> 08:06.589
If you flame it up andit burns off my eyebrows,

08:06.693 --> 08:08.384
I don't know if you're goingto win, just so you know.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.799
[laughs] I heard that.

08:09.903 --> 08:11.698
Don't worry, chefs, I'm
not going to burn you.

08:11.801 --> 08:13.941
If anybody is going to getburned today, it'll be me.

08:14.045 --> 08:14.908
Um, let's say you--

08:15.011 --> 08:15.805
ALL: Oo.

08:18.463 --> 08:19.395
Oh no, no, no.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.085
I almost grabbed
it, and I was like--

08:20.189 --> 08:20.983
[exclaims]

08:21.086 --> 08:22.053
Don't do that.

08:22.156 --> 08:24.158
You've got to have a
little trust in me.

08:24.262 --> 08:25.505
Is pozole something
you've made before?

08:25.608 --> 08:26.920
Is it, like, something
you're practiced at?

08:27.023 --> 08:28.197
I have, like--

08:28.300 --> 08:30.337
I have never like this.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.374
I'm serving them a dishthat I've never made before.

08:33.478 --> 08:36.308
I'm combining two differentcuisines in a totally different

08:36.412 --> 08:39.657
style than people are expectingof something called a pozole.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.176
And I'm the only one who's
not making shrimp today

08:42.280 --> 08:45.835
because this is Hell's Kitchen,I'm not going to play it safe.

08:45.939 --> 08:46.733
It smells great.

08:46.836 --> 08:48.562
Thank you.

08:48.666 --> 08:49.943
Garlic-- garlic and shrimp.Wow.

08:51.047 --> 08:52.566

08:52.670 --> 08:56.639
Uh, it's-- it's-- it's-- uh.

09:00.194 --> 09:01.610
dom--

09:01.713 --> 09:03.404
Oh, damn it.

09:03.508 --> 09:04.785
I'm not sure.

09:04.889 --> 09:07.167
It's really important whenyou're cooking any ingredient,

09:07.270 --> 09:08.962
you should probably know
where it comes from.

09:09.065 --> 09:09.583
- Of course.
- Yeah?

09:09.687 --> 09:10.480
Mm-hm.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.724
This is just embarrassing.

09:12.828 --> 09:14.105
90 seconds.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.831
You said you havebread with it too, right?

09:15.934 --> 09:16.763
Yes, sir.

09:16.866 --> 09:17.695
There-- there's tequila?

09:17.798 --> 09:18.627
Help yourself, Chef.

09:18.730 --> 09:19.593

09:31.571 --> 09:32.537

10:19.032 --> 10:20.550
I'm really excited
for your feedback

10:20.654 --> 10:23.001

10:23.105 --> 10:24.278
Were you on the--

10:24.382 --> 10:25.452
Yeah.

10:25.555 --> 10:28.110
So, I was on Season 6,
about nine years ago.

10:28.213 --> 10:29.939
How far did you make
it the first time?

10:30.043 --> 10:31.872
I made it to third, so--

10:31.976 --> 10:34.392
if I make it one more round,I'll be back where I was,

10:34.495 --> 10:36.946

10:53.583 --> 10:55.344

11:21.232 --> 11:22.889
NARRATOR: And rookie
Motto is cutting it

11:22.992 --> 11:24.580
a little too close for comfort.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.133
GORDON RAMSAY: 5, 4--

11:26.237 --> 11:28.101
Not much time
to think about it,

11:28.204 --> 11:29.999
just kinda have to put
it down and hopefully,

11:30.103 --> 11:31.932
the flavor speaks for itself.

11:32.036 --> 11:36.385
GORDON RAMSAY: --3,
2, 1, and down.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.836

the second round of dishes--

11:43.910 --> 11:44.807

11:44.911 --> 11:45.705
I like that.

11:45.808 --> 11:46.844
Yeah.

11:46.947 --> 11:48.328
Like, everything was

11:55.404 --> 11:56.716
OK.

11:56.819 --> 11:59.546
I'm just gonna back up so Idon't get you with this steam.

11:59.649 --> 12:01.824
It's a shrimp stock-- headsand bodies and everything,

12:01.928 --> 12:02.894
yeah, bay leaf.

12:02.998 --> 12:05.414
So this is shrimp
scampi, but it's my way

12:05.517 --> 12:09.901
because I have tequila insteadof wine, which is more fun,

12:10.005 --> 12:11.834
and I wanted that kind
of bold flavor in there.

12:11.938 --> 12:14.872
Mia, between us-- have you hada little tequila this morning?

12:14.975 --> 12:16.943
[laughs] [EXAGGERATED] No.

12:17.046 --> 12:19.946
[laughs] You're asking me?

12:20.049 --> 12:21.326
Oh no, there's no
way I'm going to be

12:21.430 --> 12:22.983
drinking while I'm working.

12:23.087 --> 12:26.124
But I'm Puerto Rican,
this is what we do.

12:26.228 --> 12:28.368
When it comes to
booze, I'm a pro.

12:28.471 --> 12:29.472
[laughs]

Well, you have a
shot glass right there.

Yeah, absolutely.

12:54.118 --> 12:57.984
[music playing]

12:58.087 --> 12:59.640
He's got some little
tricks up his sleeve

12:59.744 --> 13:02.989
that these other guys
have not experienced.

13:03.092 --> 13:04.128
Good flavor.

13:04.231 --> 13:06.475
I don't know how I feel
about this [inaudible]

13:06.578 --> 13:08.477
It's a little-- it's
a little undercooked.

13:23.699 --> 13:24.976
You made your own dumplings?

13:25.080 --> 13:27.013
I made my own dumplings justminutes ago in the kitchen.

13:27.116 --> 13:28.808
And albondigas is, like,one of the best soups ever.

13:28.911 --> 13:30.016
Yes.

13:30.119 --> 13:31.672
This is, like, fuckingspeaking to me right now.

13:31.776 --> 13:32.570
OK, good.

13:32.673 --> 13:33.882
I really want to eat this.

13:33.985 --> 13:35.435

They're familiar with
pozole, and they're

13:38.093 --> 13:41.372
excited about this fusiondish, so I feel like they're

I love it.

13:52.245 --> 13:54.040
I wouldn't change
how I did anything.

13:54.143 --> 13:56.318
I went in with a
great game plan.

13:56.421 --> 13:58.251
I feel like it
was well-executed,

13:58.354 --> 14:00.184
so I'm confident
that I got this.

14:00.287 --> 14:03.014
This is like apost-modern take on pozole.

14:03.118 --> 14:05.568
If either one of you
guys made this for me,

14:05.672 --> 14:06.949
I would, like, just
push it back at you.

14:07.053 --> 14:08.468

I already locked mine in.

14:14.163 --> 14:14.992
Yeah.

14:15.095 --> 14:15.924
I think we all agree.

14:16.027 --> 14:17.304
I think we all--
all have the same--

14:17.408 --> 14:19.065
I'm pretty sure
we're all the same.

14:39.948 --> 14:41.535
and I want to get out
of this house, man.

14:41.639 --> 14:42.674
I'm tired of punishments.

14:42.778 --> 14:46.540
--and the dish of
the day belongs to--

14:46.644 --> 14:48.542
This is the first
dish in the competition

14:48.646 --> 14:50.510
that I'm not
entirely sure about.

14:50.613 --> 14:51.891
It could have been great.

14:51.994 --> 14:53.237
I could have knocked
it out of the park,

14:53.340 --> 14:55.618
or it could havecompletely just not worked.

14:55.722 --> 14:57.379
--it was so close.

14:57.482 --> 15:01.970
Congratulations to Ariel.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.229
I've arranged for you to
spend an incredible day

15:20.333 --> 15:24.130
at the beach in Malibu,and you'll be on horseback.

15:24.233 --> 15:25.165
Nice.

15:25.269 --> 15:26.408
On top of that,
I've arranged for you

15:26.511 --> 15:28.134
to have your very own
personal masseuse.

15:28.237 --> 15:29.066
Nice.

15:29.169 --> 15:30.032
[laughs]

15:30.136 --> 15:31.068
Do you know what, Ariel?

15:31.171 --> 15:34.519
It is too good
not to share this.

15:34.623 --> 15:37.453
So think of one of
our fellow competitors

15:37.557 --> 15:39.214
you'd like to take with you.

15:39.317 --> 15:40.353
Oh, my gosh.

15:40.456 --> 15:41.354
Take a good look.

15:41.457 --> 15:43.149
You know these
competitors inside out.

15:43.252 --> 15:44.012
Oh, my gosh.

15:46.807 --> 15:48.085
Let's take Bret.
- Bret?

15:48.188 --> 15:48.982
Yeah, let's.

15:49.086 --> 15:49.914
You need to get out.

15:50.018 --> 15:51.157
Bret, Ariel, head
off to the dorm.

15:51.260 --> 15:52.123
Thank you, Chef.

15:52.227 --> 15:53.953
The boys haven't
been out in so long,

15:54.056 --> 15:56.610
and Mia, you gotta take one forthe team every once in a while.

15:56.714 --> 15:59.061
I mean, you've only
had one punishment.

15:59.165 --> 16:00.166
You'll be OK.

16:00.269 --> 16:01.098
Yo, thank you, homie.

16:01.201 --> 16:01.995
Yes.

16:02.099 --> 16:02.927
I appreciate you, bro.

16:03.031 --> 16:06.206
I need this fucking
rub down bad.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.588
[babbling]

16:08.691 --> 16:09.554
Right.

16:09.658 --> 16:12.247
Mia and Motto, you
two will be here

16:12.350 --> 16:15.008
in Hell's Kitchen on bar duty.

16:15.112 --> 16:18.391
We've just received multiplecases of limes, lemons,

16:18.494 --> 16:22.050
grapefruits, oranges,
and also kumquats,

16:22.153 --> 16:24.500
and you'll be preparing
every single item

16:24.604 --> 16:26.571
of that fruit for our
bartender this evening--

16:26.675 --> 16:28.608
washing, peeling, zesting.

16:28.711 --> 16:30.196
Once all that fruit
is prepared, I'd like

16:30.299 --> 16:32.198
you to make an amazing sangria.

16:32.301 --> 16:34.234
Mia, Motto-- to the patio.

16:34.338 --> 16:36.478
Off you go.

16:36.581 --> 16:37.306
MOTTO: I'm used to these.

16:37.410 --> 16:38.273
It's OK.

16:38.376 --> 16:41.172
[laughs] At least
I get to spend

16:41.276 --> 16:44.141
the day with you and not Bret.

16:44.244 --> 16:47.696
It sucks that I didn't
get to go to Malibu,

16:47.799 --> 16:50.492
but at least I don't haveto spend the day with Bret.

16:50.595 --> 16:51.700
[groans]

16:51.803 --> 16:54.496
So I'm glad she took him.

16:54.599 --> 16:55.807
ARIEL: Oh my god,
it's so nice out.

16:55.911 --> 16:56.705
Yes!

16:56.808 --> 16:57.637
Oh, the sun.

16:57.740 --> 16:58.603
The rain has stopped.

16:58.707 --> 16:59.673
Yes.

16:59.777 --> 17:00.950
Let me get that door
for you, darling.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.332
Let me get that
door for you, girl.

17:03.436 --> 17:06.025
[music playing]

17:06.128 --> 17:07.992
Oh, these limes are a bitch.

17:08.096 --> 17:10.305
You know what's annoyingabout this garnish?

17:10.408 --> 17:12.203
It's so tedious to make.

17:12.307 --> 17:16.173
Yes, you start with an orange,and you get every single side,

17:16.276 --> 17:18.244
and then you go on
to another orange.

17:18.347 --> 17:20.280
And when you feel like you'vedone enough, you look--

17:20.384 --> 17:23.835
[music playing]

17:23.939 --> 17:26.493
--and you still have a
hundred oranges to go.

17:26.597 --> 17:27.391
[rattling]

17:27.494 --> 17:28.495
Oh, are you OK?

17:28.599 --> 17:29.669
Yeah, I'm good.

17:29.772 --> 17:31.533
And when you're done
with those 100 oranges,

17:31.636 --> 17:36.124
you have 200 limes and 200lemons and 100 grapefruit,

17:36.227 --> 17:39.679
so it's like thenever-ending pit of citrus.

17:39.782 --> 17:41.370
Man.

17:41.474 --> 17:43.821
Orange you glad you'renot doing this with Bret?

17:43.924 --> 17:46.099
[laughs]

17:46.203 --> 17:49.068
How long have you been
wanting to say that?

17:49.171 --> 17:51.000
[music playing]

17:51.104 --> 17:53.693
All right, Clifford,
nice and easy, pal.

17:53.796 --> 17:55.212
I'm your friend, I promise.

17:55.315 --> 17:56.972
Never did I expect
to be on a horse.

17:57.076 --> 17:57.904
ARIEL: I know.

17:58.007 --> 17:59.595
This your first time?

17:59.699 --> 18:00.734
Yeah, I think so.
Oh!

18:00.838 --> 18:01.666
Oh my god.

18:01.770 --> 18:03.254
Whoa, wait, oh, nice and easy.

18:03.358 --> 18:07.362
Riding on this horse
is absolutely priceless.

18:07.465 --> 18:08.259
Over this way?

18:08.363 --> 18:09.157
No.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.365
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:10.468 --> 18:11.297
Go.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.436
Whoa, whoa, this way.

18:12.539 --> 18:13.333
Go, go, go.

18:13.437 --> 18:14.748
OK, go.

18:14.852 --> 18:17.199
He doesn't look at
your finger, honey.

18:17.303 --> 18:20.927
He's pointing, trying to tellhis horse to go that way,

18:21.030 --> 18:21.997
go that way.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.620
All right, getting
the hang of this.

18:24.724 --> 18:26.760
I'm the first personwearing loafers on a horse.

18:26.864 --> 18:29.453
[laughs] Wait,
take it easy, pal.

18:29.556 --> 18:30.695
This is great.

18:30.799 --> 18:31.593
I love horses.

18:31.696 --> 18:34.872
[music playing]

18:36.115 --> 18:37.564
ARIEL: It feels great
to be at the beach.

18:37.668 --> 18:41.189
This is my spot of zen.

18:41.292 --> 18:45.676
It's quiet and it's peaceful,and it's just perfect.

18:45.779 --> 18:46.780
BRET: Oh, yeah.

18:46.884 --> 18:49.024
Oh, yeah, right there.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.474
Oh, yeah.

18:50.577 --> 18:51.854
Oh, yes.

18:51.958 --> 18:52.752
Oh!

18:52.855 --> 18:54.236
Oh, yeah, right there, Denise.

18:54.340 --> 18:55.410
Oh yeah.

18:55.513 --> 18:56.514
Bret.

18:56.618 --> 18:58.344
You are trying to
make this a sexy time.

18:58.447 --> 18:59.621
Why?

18:59.724 --> 19:00.622
Oh, yes.

19:00.725 --> 19:01.519
Oh!

19:01.623 --> 19:02.969
Fuck yes!

19:03.072 --> 19:04.833
[grunts]

19:04.936 --> 19:07.007
I had never
envisioned this moment--

19:07.111 --> 19:11.805
me, beautiful ocean, the
breeze, the birds, and--

19:11.909 --> 19:13.290
BRET: [grunts]

19:13.393 --> 19:14.222
--Bret.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.603
BRET: Ariel, God
bless your soul.

19:16.707 --> 19:17.501
Uh!

19:17.604 --> 19:20.262
[quirky music]

19:20.366 --> 19:22.471
So, Mia, you're not used tothis, but this is a punishment.

19:22.575 --> 19:23.990
I know, Chef because I'm here.

19:24.093 --> 19:25.440
Motto, keeps on[inaudible],, haven't you?

19:25.543 --> 19:26.475
One or two, Chef.

19:26.579 --> 19:29.409
Last time I got
out the house was

19:29.513 --> 19:31.515
whenever we did the animals.

19:31.618 --> 19:33.517
Oh, shit.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.622
I've been through so
many punishments here.

19:35.726 --> 19:37.314
Let's see if I can
remember them all--

19:37.417 --> 19:38.625
shucking corn--
[chime]

19:38.729 --> 19:39.592
--shoveled shit--

19:39.695 --> 19:40.524
[chime]

19:40.627 --> 19:41.456
--I've cut ice--

19:41.559 --> 19:42.388
[chime]

19:42.491 --> 19:43.285
--I baked birthday cake.

19:43.389 --> 19:44.183
[chime]

19:44.286 --> 19:45.425
I don't know about that.

19:45.529 --> 19:47.565
Then I had to clean
the dining room--

19:47.669 --> 19:48.566
[chime]

19:48.670 --> 19:50.085
I had to make gelato.
[chime]

19:50.189 --> 19:51.120
Good god.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.536
Fortune cookies is
still the worst one.

19:52.639 --> 19:53.640
[chime]

19:53.744 --> 19:55.608
My back's hurting
pretty good right now.

19:55.711 --> 19:57.196
Doing a little springcleaning around the house.

19:57.299 --> 19:58.093
[chime]

19:58.197 --> 20:00.026
[bell rattles]

20:00.129 --> 20:01.027
Now we're peeling some fruit--

20:01.130 --> 20:01.924
[chime]

20:02.028 --> 20:03.305
--a lot of fruit.

20:03.409 --> 20:05.583
I'm definitely, like, ChefRamsay's personal whipping boy

20:05.687 --> 20:07.033
at this point.

20:07.136 --> 20:08.207
Good times.

20:08.310 --> 20:09.104
NARRATOR: Coming up--

20:09.208 --> 20:10.209

20:11.727 --> 20:14.178
NARRATOR: --the final four chefsare tested at running the pass.

20:14.282 --> 20:15.731

20:28.123 --> 20:28.917

20:30.125 --> 20:31.368
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.Let's go.

20:31.471 --> 20:32.265
Subito.

20:32.369 --> 20:35.544
[music playing]

20:39.445 --> 20:40.998
NARRATOR: Expectations
are high tonight

20:41.101 --> 20:42.931
as the dining room
fills with VIP

20:43.034 --> 20:44.691
guests and celebrity diners--

20:44.795 --> 20:46.210
I'm so excited.

20:46.314 --> 20:47.591
NARRATOR: --all
looking for a meal

20:47.694 --> 20:50.697

20:54.322 --> 20:56.772

Looks like people are
rushing around already.

20:58.809 --> 21:01.398
NARRATOR: --each taking aturn at running the pass.

21:01.501 --> 21:04.021
As we change sections tonight,what's the most important

21:04.124 --> 21:05.264
thing we do to each other?

21:05.367 --> 21:06.126
Let each other
know what's going on.

21:06.230 --> 21:07.300
Tell each other
what's going on.

21:07.404 --> 21:08.819
NARRATOR: While a
chef is at the pass,

21:08.922 --> 21:11.235
sous chef Christina will
cover their station,

21:11.339 --> 21:13.479
delivering surprise
sabotages designed

21:13.582 --> 21:15.239
to keep them on their toes.

21:15.343 --> 21:18.207
It's so cool, like, actuallyseeing him, like, up close.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.348
He's down to the last four.

21:20.451 --> 21:21.556

Walk it in, please.

21:34.672 --> 21:36.709
Four covers, table 14--two tartare, two carbonara.

21:36.812 --> 21:37.848
Heard?
ALL: Heard.

21:37.951 --> 21:38.711
Yes, Chef.
- Thank you.

21:38.814 --> 21:40.057
This is my kitchen now.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.265
Ain't nothing getting in my way.

21:41.369 --> 21:42.680
If it does, I feel bad
for it, because I'm

21:42.784 --> 21:44.130
kicking it the fuck down.

21:44.233 --> 21:46.339
I don't knock anymore,
I kick doors down.

21:46.443 --> 21:47.547
How long, two carbonara, please?

21:47.651 --> 21:48.445
In my hand.

21:48.548 --> 21:49.584
I need about 30 seconds, Chef.

21:49.687 --> 21:51.724
NARRATOR: Bret's first
sabotage of the evening

21:51.827 --> 21:54.899

21:56.453 --> 21:57.557

21:57.661 --> 21:58.455

Well spotted.

22:06.048 --> 22:06.946
30 seconds, Chef.

22:07.049 --> 22:07.878
Come on, man.

22:07.981 --> 22:09.224
I definitely know my noodles.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.950
I can do this shit
in my sleep, man.

22:11.053 --> 22:12.641

10 seconds.

22:13.677 --> 22:15.092
And 30 seconds on scallops.

22:15.195 --> 22:17.370
Running the pass forChef Ramsay is a big deal.

22:17.474 --> 22:19.372
You have to delegate to your
team and time everything

22:19.476 --> 22:21.132
and plate everything andmake sure everything tastes

22:21.236 --> 22:22.341
perfect and cooked perfect.

22:22.444 --> 22:23.480
They're not so good on the cook.

22:23.583 --> 22:25.309
You need a harder sear
on that, please, Ariel.

22:25.413 --> 22:27.138
Everything has to be flawlessfive-star performances.

22:27.242 --> 22:28.036

[tense music]

22:51.611 --> 22:52.440
Oh, shit.

22:54.027 --> 22:54.821
Talk to me.

22:54.925 --> 22:55.788
It's orzo.

22:55.891 --> 22:56.720
Fuck!

22:56.823 --> 22:57.893
Yeah, it is.

22:57.997 --> 22:59.170
- Not funny.
- It's not funny.

22:59.274 --> 23:00.379
I'm not laughing.
- Not funny.

23:00.482 --> 23:01.172

23:02.001 --> 23:02.311
Come on.
- Heard, Chef.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.243

Chef, you gave
me orzo, I need--

23:04.624 --> 23:05.660
I need arborio rice, please.

23:05.763 --> 23:08.525
Bret, this is your dish
that went on the menu.

23:08.628 --> 23:10.734
You should have this down.

23:10.837 --> 23:12.114

- Thank you, risotto.

23:12.218 --> 23:13.046

do you understand?
- Ariel?

23:31.858 --> 23:32.894
I have a ticket for four.

23:32.997 --> 23:33.791
All right.

23:33.895 --> 23:34.861

23:43.249 --> 23:44.526
ARIEL: There is zero
room for error tonight,

23:44.630 --> 23:47.391
so right out the gate, I'm goingto keep this momentum going.

23:47.495 --> 23:50.049
What is-- What is this?

23:50.152 --> 23:52.396
This is not beef.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.018
This is tuna.

23:54.122 --> 23:55.123
Why do I have tuna?

23:55.226 --> 23:57.228
I need two beef tartare,
not tuna tartare.

23:57.332 --> 23:58.471
Good.

23:58.575 --> 23:59.368
Look at me.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.611
Well spotted.

24:00.715 --> 24:02.130
Understand why I say we haveto taste everything now?

24:02.233 --> 24:05.374
I completely forgot about thesabotages, and then it kicks in

24:05.478 --> 24:07.204
and it's like, oh,
shit, that's right.

24:07.307 --> 24:08.964
They're testing us.

24:09.068 --> 24:10.518
Let's go, tartare!

24:10.621 --> 24:12.968
You're taking me down here.

24:13.072 --> 24:14.314
You've got scrambled
eggs here, Bret.

24:14.418 --> 24:15.246
GORDON RAMSAY: Well spotted.

24:15.350 --> 24:16.144
I can't serve this.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.145
I have scrambled eggs in here.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.042
BRET: Heard.

24:18.146 --> 24:19.250
I need a new carbonara.

24:19.354 --> 24:20.666
BRET: Right away, Chef.

24:20.769 --> 24:23.013
NARRATOR: For Ariel's nextquality control check,

24:23.116 --> 24:25.049
Chef Ramsay has
swapped the fennel

24:25.153 --> 24:27.051
puree with an onion puree.

24:27.155 --> 24:27.949
Stop.

24:28.052 --> 24:29.813
Taste that.

24:29.916 --> 24:32.609
Taste, taste, taste.

24:32.712 --> 24:34.749
It needs a little bit moresalt, and it's a little loose.

24:34.852 --> 24:35.681
Cream?

24:35.784 --> 24:37.027
No, but what is it?

24:37.130 --> 24:38.338
- Uh, fennel.
- No.

24:38.442 --> 24:39.236
Taste it.

24:39.339 --> 24:40.271
It tastes like celery root.

24:40.375 --> 24:41.169
No, taste it again.

24:41.272 --> 24:42.066
Potato.

24:42.170 --> 24:43.102
Again, again.

24:43.205 --> 24:43.999
Come on.

24:44.103 --> 24:45.242
Sugar?

24:45.345 --> 24:46.692
- Onion.
- OK, onion.

24:46.795 --> 24:47.900
Sorry.
- Now, look at me.

24:48.003 --> 24:49.522
You missed it.Don't put your head down.

24:49.626 --> 24:50.627
Get your head up.
Let's go.

24:50.730 --> 24:52.318
So, I'm just trying
to remember to breathe

24:52.421 --> 24:54.216
and that it's perfectly
normal that I'm

24:54.320 --> 24:58.013
running the pass with ChefGordon Ramsay, no big deal.

24:58.117 --> 24:58.945
Enjoy, guys.

24:59.049 --> 25:02.708
Wow, thanks so much.

25:02.811 --> 25:03.847
So good.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.158
Delicious.

25:05.262 --> 25:06.056
Good job.

25:06.159 --> 25:07.091
Well spotted.

25:07.195 --> 25:08.748
Caught one, lost one.
- Sorry, Chef.

25:08.852 --> 25:10.129
Back on the fish, please.Let's go.

25:10.232 --> 25:11.613
All right, Mia--
- Yes?

25:11.717 --> 25:12.545
Come over.

25:12.649 --> 25:13.891
I have a four-top for you.

25:13.995 --> 25:15.790
Heard that.

25:15.893 --> 25:17.895
Uh, four covers, table 5.

25:17.999 --> 25:20.001
Appetizer-- one
carbonara, one scallop,

ALL: Yes, Chef.

25:27.077 --> 25:28.250
OK.

25:28.354 --> 25:29.700
I know I can run a kitchen.

25:29.804 --> 25:31.737
Chef Ramsay just needs
to see it and I'm

25:31.840 --> 25:33.083
going to show it tonight.

25:33.186 --> 25:33.980
How long, lobster?

25:34.084 --> 25:34.947
Walking lobster.

25:35.050 --> 25:35.913
[inaudible]

25:36.017 --> 25:37.363
Hurry.

25:37.466 --> 25:39.503
Walking lobster, a Welly, andlamb's right behind it, Chef.

25:39.607 --> 25:41.367
NARRATOR: For Mia's
first sabotage,

25:41.470 --> 25:44.370
Chef Christina has swappedout her lobster Wellington

25:44.473 --> 25:46.545
with one made using monkfish.

25:46.648 --> 25:48.270
Chef, this is lobster
right, not monkfish?

25:48.374 --> 25:49.168
Sorry?

25:49.271 --> 25:50.445
It doesn't look like lobster.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.791
You're absolutely right.
Well spotted.

25:51.895 --> 25:52.689
It is monkfish.

25:52.792 --> 25:54.000
Yes, Chef.

25:54.104 --> 25:55.726
Christina, can I have thelobster Wellington, please?

25:55.830 --> 25:56.624
Got it.

25:56.727 --> 25:57.590
Moving on.

25:57.694 --> 25:58.487
What's next?

25:58.591 --> 25:59.488
Keep it coming.

25:59.592 --> 26:00.904
I'm ready for it.

26:01.007 --> 26:02.561
Slice the New
York strip, please.

26:02.664 --> 26:03.941
Yes, Chef.

26:04.045 --> 26:06.047
NARRATOR: For Mia's
second test, Chef Ramsay

26:06.150 --> 26:09.222
has substituted a ribeye
for the New York strip.

26:09.326 --> 26:10.430
How is the temperature?
Stop.

26:10.534 --> 26:11.466
Medium-rare, Chef.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.571
And what does that
look like to you?

26:15.643 --> 26:17.645
What does the steak
look like to you?

26:17.748 --> 26:18.784
Does it look like
a New York strip?

26:18.887 --> 26:19.716
Ribeye?

26:19.819 --> 26:20.820
Because-- yeah,
it is a ribeye.

26:20.924 --> 26:21.718
Yes, Chef.

26:22.753 --> 26:24.065
Two New York.

26:24.168 --> 26:27.447
Well, I can tell a cut of meat,but in the heat of the moment,

26:27.551 --> 26:29.553
it's really hard to
catch these things.

26:29.657 --> 26:32.073
How long, carbonara,
risotto, two tartare?

26:32.176 --> 26:33.799
Right here.

26:33.902 --> 26:35.110
Pass the risotto down.

26:35.214 --> 26:37.423
Pull it down.

26:37.526 --> 26:38.838
Fuck me, man.

26:38.942 --> 26:41.703
[tense music]

26:41.807 --> 26:42.773
Yes, Chef?

26:42.877 --> 26:43.981
All of you just stop
what you're doing.

26:44.085 --> 26:45.051
BRET: No problem, Chef.

26:45.155 --> 26:48.020
Yeah, right fucking
now, and taste this.

26:48.123 --> 26:48.952
Is that our best?

26:49.055 --> 26:50.125
That's the question.

26:50.229 --> 26:52.541
It stinks of garlic,there's no texture to it.

26:52.645 --> 26:53.681
It's like we struggled.

26:53.784 --> 26:56.131
Can we have a proper
fucking risotto?

26:56.235 --> 26:57.512
Who made this?

26:57.616 --> 27:00.964
[tense music]

27:01.067 --> 27:02.482
[hissing]

27:02.586 --> 27:05.934
[tense music]

27:08.592 --> 27:11.768
NARRATOR: The final four chefsare being tested at the pass.

27:11.871 --> 27:13.701
And with rookie
Mia at the helm--

27:13.804 --> 27:15.288
All of you, just
stop what you're doing.

27:15.392 --> 27:16.704
BRET: No problem, Chef.

27:16.807 --> 27:19.534
NARRATOR: --one bad dish hasbrought the kitchen to a halt.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.431
Who made this?

27:23.296 --> 27:24.228
Uh, Motto started--

27:24.332 --> 27:25.989
I finished, Chef.
- OK.

27:26.092 --> 27:27.576
Is that our best, that's
the question I've got.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.577
Absolutely not, Chef.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.372
Can we have a proper
fucking risotto?

27:30.476 --> 27:31.546
Absolutely, Chef.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.375
My bad, but I ain't
really worried about it.

27:33.479 --> 27:34.480
I got this, Chef.

27:34.583 --> 27:35.792
Bret, how long risotto?

27:35.895 --> 27:36.965
Risotto walking now.

27:37.069 --> 27:37.897
Simple.

27:38.001 --> 27:39.002
Yeah, I got you.

27:39.105 --> 27:39.934
I'll taste it.

27:40.037 --> 27:41.383
Yes, Chef.

27:41.487 --> 27:44.732
[tense music]

27:46.354 --> 27:47.148
Serve it?

27:47.251 --> 27:48.183
Yeah.

27:48.287 --> 27:49.081
Well done.

27:49.184 --> 27:49.944
Heard.

27:50.047 --> 27:50.979
Thank you.

27:51.083 --> 27:52.256
Take this.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.292
Thank you.

27:53.395 --> 27:54.224
That's broken.

27:54.327 --> 27:55.259
Can you please change that egg?

27:55.363 --> 27:56.157
Well spotted.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.296
Heard.

27:57.399 --> 27:59.574
It's the cream of the
crop, and every step

27:59.678 --> 28:02.715
of the competition has
been preparing me--

28:02.819 --> 28:03.889
Here we go, yes?

28:03.992 --> 28:05.131
Good girl.

28:05.235 --> 28:08.203
--to become the nextexecutive chef in Las Vegas.

28:08.307 --> 28:10.516
I need these a littlelooser, a little more soft.

28:10.619 --> 28:11.551
Got you.

28:11.655 --> 28:12.621
That's my passion.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.589
[inaudible]

28:14.693 --> 28:15.763
Take this.

28:15.866 --> 28:16.833
Look at me.

28:16.936 --> 28:18.386
You're last line of defense, OK?Well done.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.559
Jump back on meat, please.- Thank you.

28:19.663 --> 28:21.354
- Let's go.
- Running the pass--

28:21.458 --> 28:23.632
it's definitely
extremely stressful,

28:23.736 --> 28:25.738
and I'm mad that I
didn't catch the ribeye.

28:25.842 --> 28:27.602
That one was obvious,
especially since I

28:27.706 --> 28:29.259
was cooking New York all night.

28:36.128 --> 28:38.233
Uh, Motto, let's go.

28:38.337 --> 28:39.890
Christina, on the
garnish, please.

28:39.994 --> 28:40.822
Yes, Chef.

28:40.926 --> 28:41.720
Here we go.

28:41.823 --> 28:42.651
The kitchen is yours.

28:42.755 --> 28:43.929
You run it or it runs you.Got me?

28:44.032 --> 28:44.584
Heard.
Yes, Chef.

28:44.688 --> 28:45.585
Good.

28:45.689 --> 28:46.655
I'm definitely
excited to run the pass.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.416
I'm ready for whatever
is thrown at me,

28:48.519 --> 28:50.107
so it's time to step
up and prove it.

28:50.211 --> 28:51.419
MARINO: OK, Chef Motto?

28:51.522 --> 28:52.351

Marino.

29:06.434 --> 29:07.090

29:07.193 --> 29:07.780
Hey.
MARINO: What's up?

29:07.884 --> 29:08.677
Salmon tartare?

29:08.781 --> 29:09.955
Shit.
Sorry.

29:10.058 --> 29:11.059
- Wake up, you.
- Sorry.

29:11.163 --> 29:11.991
Sorry, Chef.
- Wake up.

29:12.095 --> 29:12.992
Well spotted.

29:13.096 --> 29:14.545

29:14.649 --> 29:15.443
Oh, that's right.

29:15.546 --> 29:17.065
It's sabotage night.

29:17.169 --> 29:17.997
[laughs]

29:18.101 --> 29:18.929
One pork, all day.

29:19.033 --> 29:20.103
GORDON RAMSAY:
Pork, please, Ariel?

29:20.206 --> 29:22.070
Heard, Chef.

29:22.174 --> 29:23.175
Thank you.

29:23.278 --> 29:24.659
NARRATOR: For
Motto's next test--

29:24.763 --> 29:25.798
GORDON RAMSAY: Where is it?

29:25.902 --> 29:27.489
NARRATOR: --Chef
Ramsay has swapped out

29:27.593 --> 29:29.319
the pork chop for a veal chop.

29:29.422 --> 29:30.389
GORDON RAMSAY: I'll finish that.

29:30.492 --> 29:31.908
Slice your, uh, pork, please.

29:32.011 --> 29:32.943
Yes, Chef.

29:33.047 --> 29:34.876
Two hands, twice as quick.

29:34.980 --> 29:37.706
Slice your pork.

29:37.810 --> 29:38.673
Pork's not cooked.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.950
It's under.
Hold up.

29:40.054 --> 29:40.848
Shit.

29:40.951 --> 29:42.401
Pork needs to be cooked longer.

29:42.504 --> 29:43.471
- Heard.
- How long?

29:43.574 --> 29:44.472
Get that in the oven.

29:44.575 --> 29:45.576
Heard, heard,
heard-- give it to--

29:45.680 --> 29:47.993
Give me the pork right here.

29:48.096 --> 29:48.890
Put it down.

29:48.994 --> 29:49.788
Yes, Chef.

29:49.891 --> 29:51.272
Come here, you.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.137
Taste that.

29:54.240 --> 29:58.451
Taste this-- when
it's not cooked?

29:58.555 --> 29:59.728
Veal chop.
GORDON RAMSAY: Sorry?

29:59.832 --> 30:01.006
The bone.

30:01.109 --> 30:02.766
It's veal, that's right.

30:02.870 --> 30:03.663
MOTTO: Yeah, OK.

30:03.767 --> 30:04.803
Yeah, that's veal.

30:04.906 --> 30:08.047
Yeah, now I realize the
one bone instead of two.

30:08.151 --> 30:09.531
It's hard to tell.

30:09.635 --> 30:11.188
I'll do the scallops,you do the Wellington, yes?

30:11.292 --> 30:12.155
Yes, Chef.

30:12.258 --> 30:13.708
Running the pass
is very difficult.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.573
It's incredible how ChefRamsay can juggle all this.

30:16.676 --> 30:17.781
Come on guys,
pick it up, please.

30:17.885 --> 30:18.989
Let's go.

30:19.093 --> 30:20.646
And the way he pushes--it's been inspiring to me,

30:20.749 --> 30:23.062
so I think he's made
me a better chef.

30:23.166 --> 30:24.512
Can I get this a little warmer?CHRISTINA: What?

30:24.615 --> 30:25.685
Yeah, yeah.
Give it to me.

30:25.789 --> 30:27.101
I mean, I'm like,just, I'm really excited.

30:27.204 --> 30:28.516
I'm fired up again.

30:28.619 --> 30:31.312
There is nothing in this worldI'd rather do than be a chef.

30:31.415 --> 30:33.486
That's what makes me who I am.

30:33.590 --> 30:34.902
Thank you, Motto.
Well done.

30:35.005 --> 30:36.144
Wipe down.
Let's go.

30:36.248 --> 30:37.076
Heard.

30:37.180 --> 30:37.939
Well done.

30:40.700 --> 30:43.289
Tonight, let's be
honest, you all

30:43.393 --> 30:46.706
felt the pressure
and the challenge

30:46.810 --> 30:49.709
of leading the kitchenin the middle of service.

30:49.813 --> 30:53.541
We all had some highs and weall had some lows, agreed?

30:53.644 --> 30:54.887
ALL: Yes, Chef.

30:54.991 --> 30:56.509
I want all four of you
to go back to the dorm,

30:56.613 --> 31:01.204
please, and tell me the oneperson that you do not think

31:01.307 --> 31:03.516
belongs in the final.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.001
ALL: Yes, Chef.
- Off you go.

31:05.104 --> 31:06.312
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

31:06.416 --> 31:07.589
Thank you, Chef.

31:07.693 --> 31:10.006
Picking someone to
put up for elimination--

31:10.109 --> 31:13.250
it's really difficult becauseit gets really cutthroat.

31:13.354 --> 31:14.665
BRET: Oh, man.

31:14.769 --> 31:18.738
We're all very passionate,but I came to this competition

31:18.842 --> 31:22.294
to win executive chef at
Hell's Kitchen in Vegas,

31:22.397 --> 31:25.331
and I'm going to fight
to the end to get it.

31:25.435 --> 31:26.850
How do you want to do this?

31:26.954 --> 31:28.231
I'm just going to say it.

31:28.334 --> 31:32.752
I'll pick you just because Ifeel like you've been staying

31:32.856 --> 31:36.273
in your comfort zone and you'renot thinking out of the box,

31:36.377 --> 31:38.103
like you're making, you
know, the same things

31:38.206 --> 31:39.035
over and over again.

31:39.138 --> 31:40.105
That's how I feel.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.382
OK.
Ha, ha.

31:41.485 --> 31:42.348
That's how you feel, Mia?

31:42.452 --> 31:43.763
There's a reason
why I'm still here.

31:43.867 --> 31:45.662
I can out-cook the
shit out of you.

31:45.765 --> 31:47.560
Well, tonight meat lagged heavy.

31:47.664 --> 31:48.561
How?

31:48.665 --> 31:49.424
Everything was
waiting on meat.

31:49.528 --> 31:50.253
Well, that's--

31:50.356 --> 31:51.047
BRET: Tonight was all meat.

31:51.150 --> 31:52.358
That's usually how it is.

31:52.462 --> 31:53.981
No, no, no-- but there
was re-- there was--

31:54.084 --> 31:54.878
you know, this, that--

31:54.982 --> 31:56.431
There wasn't re-fire anything.

31:56.535 --> 31:58.019
Nothing came back.

31:58.123 --> 31:59.331
All of my meat was
perfect tonight.

31:59.434 --> 32:00.504
BRET: Was it?
- Yes.

32:00.608 --> 32:01.989
Sure.

32:02.092 --> 32:03.922
Kiss my ass, Bret.

32:04.025 --> 32:07.028
My station was run
perfectly tonight.

32:07.132 --> 32:10.204
You, on the other hand, youhave risottos coming back.

32:10.307 --> 32:11.964
You have carbonaras coming back.

32:12.068 --> 32:13.828
Ariel, you gonna
choose one of us?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.381
I need another minute.

32:15.485 --> 32:16.313
Motto?

32:16.417 --> 32:17.314
Give me two minutes.

32:17.418 --> 32:19.765
I need to process.

32:19.868 --> 32:20.662
I'm gonna go inside.

32:20.766 --> 32:22.112
I'm really cold.

32:22.216 --> 32:24.080
It's always hard
to nominate someone,

32:24.183 --> 32:26.910
and when it's down to
the final four people,

32:27.014 --> 32:28.877
it's definitely even harder.

32:28.981 --> 32:31.915
I'm battling withmyself, trying to process

32:32.019 --> 32:34.124
everything through
my mind right now,

32:34.228 --> 32:36.609
and I think I have a decision.

32:42.650 --> 32:45.515
I don't feel like I've beenthe weakest person here.

32:45.618 --> 32:47.241
I feel like I've proved
myself day after day.

32:50.106 --> 32:51.659
I've taken all the punishments.

32:51.762 --> 32:52.556
I've kept positive.

32:52.660 --> 32:53.868
I've kept pushing.

32:53.972 --> 32:54.765
But--

32:54.869 --> 32:58.045
[tense music]

33:00.081 --> 33:01.669
--I'm going to put myself up.

33:01.772 --> 33:02.566
ARIEL: Oh, my god.

33:05.742 --> 33:07.571
Dude.

33:07.675 --> 33:09.918
Holy fucking curveball, Motto.

33:10.022 --> 33:10.816
[sighs]

33:10.919 --> 33:13.750
[ratcheting]

33:13.853 --> 33:17.754
[tense music]

33:17.857 --> 33:20.515
I don't feel like I'vebeen the weakest person here.

33:20.619 --> 33:23.691
I feel like I've proved
myself day after day.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.106
I've taken all the punishments.

33:25.210 --> 33:26.038
I've kept positive.

33:26.142 --> 33:27.971
I've kept pushing.

33:28.075 --> 33:32.769
But-- I'm going
to put myself up.

33:37.946 --> 33:41.122
Holy fucking curveball, Motto.

33:41.226 --> 33:42.468
So what you're trying
to say is that you

33:42.572 --> 33:44.815
trying to go home tonight?

33:44.919 --> 33:45.782
[sighs]

33:45.885 --> 33:47.301
[tense music]

33:47.404 --> 33:50.614
I guess so.

33:50.718 --> 33:51.512
Are you sure?

33:51.615 --> 33:52.685
MOTTO: I am sure.

33:52.789 --> 33:54.204
One of you should take
the position in Vegas

33:54.308 --> 33:55.792
is what I'm saying.

33:55.895 --> 33:58.381
I would never give up
on any of y'all, but I

33:58.484 --> 34:02.557
also can't give up on my friendsand my family background.

34:02.661 --> 34:06.630
And I gotta-- I
gotta accept that.

34:06.734 --> 34:08.667
I'm not one to give
up on anything,

34:08.770 --> 34:14.259
but I think at the end of theday the place I need to be is--

34:14.362 --> 34:16.330
is back home.

34:16.433 --> 34:17.262
I want to go back.

34:17.365 --> 34:19.850
I want to start a family.

34:19.954 --> 34:24.234
I want to raise the culinarystandard in Baton Rouge.

34:24.338 --> 34:26.650
That's what I've been workingon the last five years,

34:26.754 --> 34:28.687
I'm not ready to
give up on that.

34:28.790 --> 34:30.861
Did you just come tothis conclusion right now?

34:30.965 --> 34:32.794
It's been in the
back of my mind.

34:32.898 --> 34:34.244
OK.

34:34.348 --> 34:36.453
[sighs] I am
the support system

34:36.557 --> 34:39.111
for so many people back home.

34:39.215 --> 34:40.250
It's what I do.

34:40.354 --> 34:42.666
I want to go back and
further the mentoring

34:42.770 --> 34:44.116
that I do to people.

34:44.220 --> 34:46.636
I want to take all this
that I've learned here

34:46.739 --> 34:49.984
and I couldn't get
exposed to, and expose

34:50.088 --> 34:53.401
all these people back homewith this information.

34:53.505 --> 34:56.749
That scene is not
going to change itself.

34:56.853 --> 35:03.239
It takes so much for a personto say something like that.

35:03.342 --> 35:06.932
And when you witness someonereally, really understanding

35:07.035 --> 35:09.728
that they know exactly
where they want to be,

35:09.831 --> 35:12.662
it's just an amazing
thing to witness.

35:12.765 --> 35:13.628
Oh, Motto.

35:13.732 --> 35:15.009
Wow.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.839
The one thing I do know isI can go back to Baton Rouge

35:17.943 --> 35:20.290
and I can make that
town 10 times better--

35:20.394 --> 35:21.671
That just made me cry.

35:21.774 --> 35:26.848
--and pick people up andpush people, including myself.

35:26.952 --> 35:29.230
I still got work
to do back home.

35:29.334 --> 35:32.682
[music playing]

35:42.692 --> 35:47.628
Black jacket team, I askedyou to nominate one chef that

35:47.731 --> 35:50.562
does not belong in the finale.

35:50.665 --> 35:53.392
Have you come to a
decision on that?

35:53.496 --> 35:54.462
Yes, Chef.

35:54.566 --> 35:55.843
Was it difficult?

35:55.946 --> 35:57.396
I wouldn't say it
wasn't difficult Chef,

35:57.500 --> 35:59.950
but we did come to a decision.

36:00.054 --> 36:00.986
I put forth myself.

36:03.747 --> 36:05.853
Eh-- sorry?

36:05.956 --> 36:10.444
Uh-- tell me why.

36:10.547 --> 36:12.825
Chef, this has been
an incredible journey.

36:12.929 --> 36:15.483
You're offering this
great platform of Vegas

36:15.587 --> 36:19.246
and there's not a give
up bone in my body,

36:19.349 --> 36:21.420
and I don't want to
give up on Baton Rouge.

36:21.524 --> 36:24.043
I want to go back and sharethis wealth of knowledge

36:24.147 --> 36:27.012
that you've given me
to elevate that town's

36:27.115 --> 36:30.326
culinary scene because it'snot going to do it on its own.

36:30.429 --> 36:32.845
And I feel like that's
the place I need to be.

36:32.949 --> 36:34.813
Wow.

36:34.916 --> 36:38.541
I'm-- I'm surprised.

36:38.644 --> 36:40.612
But I respect your decision.

36:40.715 --> 36:41.923
Motto, step forward.

36:42.027 --> 36:45.203
[emotional music]

36:47.274 --> 36:51.519
You know, never beforeacross this competition have

36:51.623 --> 36:54.798
I met a chef as sincere as you.

36:54.902 --> 36:57.560
So, whilst I accept
your decision,

36:57.663 --> 36:59.458
I want you to accept
this from me--

36:59.562 --> 37:02.668
once you're done in
Baton Rouge, and you're

37:02.772 --> 37:05.188
ready for the next
move, call me.

37:05.292 --> 37:07.432
Yes, Chef.

37:07.535 --> 37:09.503
Thank you for the
opportunity, Chef.

37:09.606 --> 37:11.090
Oh, man.

37:11.194 --> 37:11.988
Take care, bud.

37:13.886 --> 37:14.715
See you guys later.

37:14.818 --> 37:16.337
God bless, Motto.

37:16.441 --> 37:17.511
ARIEL: Bye, Motto.

37:17.614 --> 37:20.962
[music playing]

37:23.102 --> 37:24.656
MOTTO: I'm walking out
with my head held high.

37:24.759 --> 37:26.209
I'm not feeling disappointed.

37:26.313 --> 37:28.176
This has been an
incredible ride.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.593
I'm Motto from Baton
Rouge, Louisiana.

37:30.696 --> 37:33.078
I think of Baton Rouge andthat extraordinary flavor.

37:33.181 --> 37:34.217
Best food in the world.

37:34.321 --> 37:35.736
What brought me into
this competition

37:35.839 --> 37:37.496
was the opportunity
to prove myself.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.911
- You want to take over, Motto?- I got it.

37:39.015 --> 37:40.154
I got it.
- Chicken's down.

37:40.258 --> 37:40.948
- Heard.
- Backup chicken here.

37:41.051 --> 37:41.742
Heard.
Got you.

37:41.845 --> 37:42.674
Go.

37:42.777 --> 37:44.538
Four New York strip--

37:44.641 --> 37:46.850
fuck-- one chicken, one fish--

37:46.954 --> 37:47.782
Fuck it.

37:47.886 --> 37:49.163
I had some rough starts--

37:49.267 --> 37:51.372
To me, it's almost inedible.

37:51.476 --> 37:52.856
--and some shaky moments--

37:52.960 --> 37:53.892
Shrimp cooked beautiful.

37:53.995 --> 37:55.790
Sauce amazing,
destroyed by the grits.

37:55.894 --> 37:57.930
--but I've stayed true
to myself the entire

37:58.034 --> 37:59.104
time I've been out here.

37:59.207 --> 37:59.967
Yeah.

38:00.070 --> 38:01.451
[splashing]

38:01.555 --> 38:02.418
You're going to bounce back.

38:05.524 --> 38:07.871
[laughing]

38:07.975 --> 38:08.907
Is that you?

38:09.010 --> 38:10.909
Love of food at
an early age, Chef.

38:11.012 --> 38:13.843
I was adjusting and
fixing as I went along.

38:13.946 --> 38:14.878
I mean, that is extraordinary.

38:14.982 --> 38:16.121
Good job, Motto.

38:16.224 --> 38:18.192
MOTTO: And I think I stoodpretty well, you know.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.677
Bret, we need more sauce
and more salt, please.

38:20.781 --> 38:21.678
Absolutely, more sauce.

38:21.782 --> 38:22.679
Baton Rouge in the house!

38:22.783 --> 38:24.094
[cheering]
BRET: Hell, yeah!

38:24.198 --> 38:25.372
That's what I'm
talking about, homie!

38:25.475 --> 38:27.857
I told you I'd see you in black!

38:27.960 --> 38:29.514
MOTTO: A big city
in the spotlight

38:29.617 --> 38:31.895
may come in the future,
but right now I just

38:31.999 --> 38:34.070
need to elevate Baton Rouge.

38:34.173 --> 38:35.692
I want to go back
there and just push

38:35.796 --> 38:37.349
the fuck out of that envelope.

38:37.453 --> 38:39.972
[exhales] And then
there were three.

38:40.076 --> 38:42.492
[tense music]

38:42.596 --> 38:47.083
But, even though Mottohas left the competition,

38:47.186 --> 38:52.295
only two chefs will be
competing in the finale.

38:52.399 --> 38:55.678
Somebody else will
be leaving right now.

38:55.781 --> 38:58.163
[tense music]

38:58.266 --> 39:01.615
[grinding]

39:01.718 --> 39:04.583
[music playing]

39:04.687 --> 39:06.378
NARRATOR: With rookie
Motto taking himself

39:06.482 --> 39:07.275
out of the competition--

39:07.379 --> 39:08.380
See you guys later.

39:08.484 --> 39:09.692
God bless, Motto.

39:09.795 --> 39:12.453
NARRATOR: --Chef Ramsay hasjust dropped another bomb.

39:12.557 --> 39:15.387
GORDON RAMSAY: Even thoughMotto left the competition,

39:15.491 --> 39:19.702
somebody else will
be leaving right now.

39:19.805 --> 39:23.188
Ariel, why do you
think you deserve to be

39:23.291 --> 39:25.570
in the "Hell's Kitchen" finale?

39:25.673 --> 39:28.435
Chef, I think I've shown youthat I have grown immensely

39:28.538 --> 39:30.195
over the last nine years.

39:30.298 --> 39:32.646
And when I came into
this competition,

39:32.749 --> 39:36.235
I wasn't entirely sure ifthis is where I belonged,

39:36.339 --> 39:38.514
but I know that this
is where I belong now.

39:38.617 --> 39:40.654
I want to go to the
next level in my career.

39:40.757 --> 39:42.069
I'm ready for this
challenge, and I'm

39:42.172 --> 39:44.140
ready for Las Vegas, Chef.

39:44.243 --> 39:45.555
Bret?

39:45.659 --> 39:49.041
I'm just extremely focusedand extra determined and hungry.

39:49.145 --> 39:51.181
I've only grown as
a person, as a chef,

39:51.285 --> 39:52.631
and I feel like I'm
ready for Vegas.

39:52.735 --> 39:54.115
I feel like Vegas
is ready for me.

39:54.219 --> 39:56.739
I have what it takes
to be that next chef.

39:56.842 --> 39:57.843
Mia?

39:57.947 --> 39:59.362
Chef, throughout
the whole competition,

39:59.466 --> 40:02.676
I've showed my skill
set and creativity.

40:02.779 --> 40:05.403
I've pushed myself
beyond limits that I

40:05.506 --> 40:07.439
didn't think I could achieve.

40:07.543 --> 40:09.993
Yes, you know,
I've had screw-ups,

40:10.097 --> 40:12.927
but I'm constantly
learning, and I

40:13.031 --> 40:15.792
feel like I would be an
asset to your company

40:15.896 --> 40:18.001
and to your restaurant.

40:18.105 --> 40:19.762
Thank you, Mia.

40:19.865 --> 40:22.143
OK, I'm ready to announce now.

41:03.081 --> 41:04.358
