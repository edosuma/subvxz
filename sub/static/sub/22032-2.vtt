__

00:17.281 --> 00:20.352
Abe's voice: <i>Brooklyn Ferry, October 14.</i>

00:21.229 --> 00:23.130
<i>Troop number is lower since my last trip,</i>

00:23.165 --> 00:24.965
<i>but naval presence still strong.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:27.905
<i>I count two dozen warships in the harbor,</i>

00:27.939 --> 00:29.675
<i>including one ship of the line...</i>

00:29.709 --> 00:33.577
<i>the Eagle, Lord Howe's
flagship with 60 guns.</i>

00:33.612 --> 00:35.912
<i>The rest are lesser armed
frigates and sloops.</i>

00:35.946 --> 00:37.445
Mr. Woodhull.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.513
Abe's voice: <i>Land defenses on
the Brooklyn side include...</i>

00:39.548 --> 00:41.114
- Mr. Woodhull, sir!
- Hmm?

00:41.148 --> 00:43.383
He wants your papers.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.252
Oh, yeah.

00:47.357 --> 00:49.058
There you go.

00:51.095 --> 00:53.095
As you can see, I have permission

00:53.129 --> 00:55.130
from Major Hewlett of
Setauket to enter the city.

00:55.164 --> 00:58.234
"For legal studies," eh?

01:01.874 --> 01:03.642
The next ferry should be here soon.

01:03.677 --> 01:05.477
You can wait over there.

01:05.510 --> 01:07.778
Don't see why I've got to lurk about here

01:07.812 --> 01:10.515
when I could be getting my
Thomas milked in holy ground.

01:10.549 --> 01:13.450
I'm afraid your pilgrimage
will have to wait.

01:13.485 --> 01:15.184
My bag, please.

01:15.219 --> 01:17.585
Seems odd you need
protecting all the way here

01:17.620 --> 01:19.653
only to hoof it about alone in the city.

01:19.687 --> 01:22.256
Makes me wonder what you're really up to

01:22.290 --> 01:23.960
with your legal studies.

01:23.995 --> 01:26.433
Don't wonder too hard.
You might hurt yourself.

01:26.467 --> 01:28.636
My bag.

01:29.738 --> 01:31.172
If Captain Simcoe were here...

01:31.206 --> 01:33.675
Your orders are from Major
Hewlett, not Captain Simcoe.

01:33.709 --> 01:34.976
And I suggest you follow them

01:35.011 --> 01:37.211
unless you want to end up like him.

01:40.815 --> 01:43.119
- <i>(Distant applause)</i>

- <i>(Feet marching)</i>

02:10.532 --> 02:12.765
(gasps, growls)

02:15.970 --> 02:18.372
Man: Your attention, please!

02:18.406 --> 02:21.706
It seems we have a poet in our midst.

02:23.208 --> 02:26.179
Shall we pause in our labors
to better appreciate his verse?

02:26.214 --> 02:28.214
- Clerk: <i>Hear, hear. Yes.</i>
- Ahem.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.983
"Say,

02:30.018 --> 02:33.923
must I all my joys forgo

02:33.957 --> 02:36.690
and still maintain this outward show?"

02:36.725 --> 02:38.528
- <i> (men laughing)</i>
- "Say,

02:38.563 --> 02:42.400
shall this breast that's pained to feel

02:42.435 --> 02:45.402

02:45.436 --> 02:49.105
<i>Shall no fair maid with equal fire</i>

02:49.140 --> 02:52.912

<i>(men laughing, applauding)</i>

03:15.307 --> 03:17.406
Oh, dear.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.040
What a mess you've made.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.507
All those forms will have to be redone.

03:21.541 --> 03:23.708
This came for you.

03:23.742 --> 03:26.409
Perhaps it's your true
love writing you back.

03:27.210 --> 03:29.778
(laughs) Boys.

03:32.914 --> 03:34.680
Man: <i>God, I'm knackered.</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:36.613
<i>(chatter)</i>

03:36.647 --> 03:38.247
<i>You should have seen this girl.</i>

03:38.281 --> 03:40.716
<i>Voluptuous breasts. You know what I mean?</i>

03:40.751 --> 03:43.649
<i>Right?</i> <i>(making squeaking noises)</i>

03:43.683 --> 03:46.887
<i>(laughing)</i>

03:48.055 --> 03:50.421
So, I showed her the silk.

03:50.456 --> 03:52.257
Said there's more where that came from.

03:52.291 --> 03:55.059
(Whistles) Never saw a woman
drop her knickers so fast.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.532
You like to read aloud? Read this.

04:02.434 --> 04:03.769
"To whom it may concern."

04:03.803 --> 04:05.439
That'd be you. Pray continue.

04:05.473 --> 04:07.409
"Captain John Simcoe

04:07.443 --> 04:09.812

posthaste to Major John André."

04:12.817 --> 04:15.119
Posthaste. That means immediately.

04:15.154 --> 04:18.257
I'm afraid I won't be able
to finish today's forms.

04:19.692 --> 04:22.628
Oh, dear. What a mess you've made.

Franklin calls it an armonica.

05:59.997 --> 06:02.067
It mechanically recreates the tones

06:02.101 --> 06:06.005
made by rubbing a wet finger
around the rim of a wine glass.

06:06.039 --> 06:08.507
So he mechanized a parlor trick.

06:08.541 --> 06:11.112
Perhaps, but this parlor

06:11.146 --> 06:13.715
is testament to the man's
genius and industry.

06:13.750 --> 06:16.516
Take his lightning rod. Placed on a roof,

06:16.550 --> 06:20.085
it guides the energy from a
bolt harmlessly to the ground.

06:20.119 --> 06:21.753
And these eyeglasses.

06:21.787 --> 06:23.286
The lenses are split,

06:23.321 --> 06:25.488
offering corrections for both close

06:25.523 --> 06:27.526
and distant viewing.

06:28.727 --> 06:30.293
You can have the house, John.

06:30.328 --> 06:33.428
I had no idea you admired
the man so ardently.

06:33.462 --> 06:35.926
What I admire is how he imposes no bounds

06:35.961 --> 06:39.595
on either his curiosity or his invention.

06:39.630 --> 06:42.196
And now he wants to invent
an alliance with France,

06:42.231 --> 06:45.164
which could turn this little
rebellion into a genuine war.

06:45.198 --> 06:46.800
Not if I have any say in the matter.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.668
<i>(Door opens)</i>

06:48.703 --> 06:51.604
Ah, here are our libations.

06:51.639 --> 06:55.073
Good. Enough anticipation.

06:55.107 --> 06:57.811
I'd like a report with my port.

06:57.846 --> 07:02.249
<i>Starting with your mole in
the rebel camp, Charles Lee.</i>

07:03.584 --> 07:05.385
(sighs)

07:05.419 --> 07:07.889
I admit, General Lee was a poor investment.

07:07.923 --> 07:10.523
I may yet use him, but for now

07:10.557 --> 07:12.557
I have my sights set on a bigger fish.

07:12.591 --> 07:14.624
Thank you, Abigail. That'll be all.

07:19.596 --> 07:21.964
André: <i>Trust me, General...</i>

07:25.968 --> 07:28.403
I realized what we need
isn't a rival to Washington,

07:28.438 --> 07:31.708
but a man who has his trust, a friend.

07:31.743 --> 07:36.244
Indeed, such friends as only the
comradeship of war can make.

07:37.512 --> 07:39.981
And who might this friend be?

07:40.015 --> 07:43.649
A man whose leadership inspires both respect

07:43.683 --> 07:45.882
<i>and affection.</i>

07:45.917 --> 07:47.818
General Benedict Arnold.

07:47.852 --> 07:50.588
<i>(Scoffs) Ridiculous.</i>

07:50.622 --> 07:53.291
Unlikely.

07:53.326 --> 07:56.063
Arnold is the best field
commander the rebels have.

07:56.097 --> 07:59.798
Yes, but as with many men driven
to succeed on the battlefield,

07:59.832 --> 08:02.600
his virtues are often matched by his flaws.

08:02.634 --> 08:05.469
Consider this. It's a report
from one of my field agents

08:05.503 --> 08:09.473
detailing Arnold's role in
the rebel victory at Saratoga.

08:09.508 --> 08:11.643
"We were on the verge of winning the battle

08:11.678 --> 08:14.517
when Arnold, forced to
serve under General Gates,

08:14.551 --> 08:16.084
<i>asked to lead a last charge.</i>

08:16.119 --> 08:18.053
<i>When Gates ordered him to stay in camp,</i>

08:18.088 --> 08:20.489
<i>Arnold disobeyed."</i>

08:22.258 --> 08:24.359
Clinton: <i>The man is insubordinate.</i>

08:24.394 --> 08:26.460
(chuckles) To Burgoyne's misfortune.

08:26.495 --> 08:28.229
"Ignoring a volley of fire,

08:28.264 --> 08:31.266
<i>he single-handedly rallied the rebel troops,</i>

08:31.300 --> 08:34.537
<i>turning a rout into a win."</i>

08:34.571 --> 08:36.039
Clinton: <i>Poor Johnny Burgoyne.</i>

08:36.073 --> 08:38.041
<i>Whipped by an apothecary.</i>

08:39.678 --> 08:42.847
But here's the rub. Gates took
full credit for the victory.

08:42.881 --> 08:45.216
What did Arnold get for his troubles?

08:48.750 --> 08:50.816
He was shot in the same leg

08:50.850 --> 08:53.117
he'd already been wounded in twice before.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.224
<i>It'll be some time before
Arnold sees another battlefield.</i>

08:59.259 --> 09:01.526
Time enough for that wound to heal,

09:01.561 --> 09:04.862
<i>but for the many slights to his vanity</i>

09:04.897 --> 09:07.068
to fester.

09:07.103 --> 09:11.206
Well, supposing he is ripe for turning,

09:11.240 --> 09:13.308
how will you turn him?

09:14.712 --> 09:16.114
I think of it as a dance.

09:16.148 --> 09:18.916
Right now I'm just trying
to select the proper music.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.718
Speaking of which, there's an affair

09:20.752 --> 09:22.186
at the house of Edward Shippen this week.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.954
- Will you be attending?
- Yes, yes.

09:23.989 --> 09:26.090
Well, that is a dance, this is war.

09:26.124 --> 09:29.092
- There is a difference.
- Trust me, General.

09:29.126 --> 09:31.026
The key to victory is having the right man.

09:31.060 --> 09:34.462
<i>Our man in the heart of the enemy camp.</i>

09:35.934 --> 09:38.100
Abe's voice: <i>York City.</i>

09:40.238 --> 09:42.405
<i>The city feels changed.</i>

09:42.439 --> 09:45.406
<i>Petty vice and deeper corruptions
have taken their toll.</i>

09:45.440 --> 09:47.376
<i>That should work in my favor.</i>

09:47.410 --> 09:50.783
(chatter)

09:52.184 --> 09:53.784
Abe's voice: <i>An acquaintance from Oyster Bay</i>

09:53.819 --> 09:57.489
<i>recommended a modest boardinghouse.</i>

09:57.523 --> 09:59.858
<i>I figured breakfast was
as good a time as any</i>

09:59.892 --> 10:02.027
<i>to get the lay of the land.</i>

10:14.707 --> 10:17.141
Morning.

10:17.175 --> 10:19.744
I wondered if you could hard-boil
a dozen of these for me.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.248
A dozen?

10:21.283 --> 10:22.815
Yeah, I got a lot of books to read.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.749
These help me get through the
long afternoons in the library.

10:26.816 --> 10:28.417
Thank you, sir.

10:32.288 --> 10:36.659
Abe's voice: <i>The city's
inhabitants seem tired, on edge.</i>

10:36.694 --> 10:40.031
<i>By my estimate, a sudden attack of 5,000 men</i>

10:40.066 --> 10:43.569
<i>could take them all and end the war.</i>

10:43.604 --> 10:46.036
- Here you are, Mr. Woodhull.
- Thank you.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.578
The last time I was here,
you couldn't take a step

10:54.612 --> 10:56.709
without tripping over a soldier.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.978
Now there are so few, a man
barely feels safe on the streets.

11:00.012 --> 11:01.681
Where are they all hiding?

11:04.152 --> 11:06.620
Best to keep to your porridge, sir.

11:08.022 --> 11:11.925
Damn! Not again.

11:17.901 --> 11:20.302
May I make a suggestion?

11:20.337 --> 11:22.303
You could hardly make things worse.

11:22.338 --> 11:25.474
My father used to make me
cry over this game all the time

11:25.508 --> 11:28.011
until I learned a few tricks for myself.

11:28.045 --> 11:30.012
He'll take my piece.

11:30.046 --> 11:32.150
Sacrifice for the greater good.

11:35.754 --> 11:37.657
(laughs)

11:40.159 --> 11:42.630
King me, you unlucky bastard.

11:49.268 --> 11:51.901
I don't know about any soldiers,

11:51.935 --> 11:54.637
but those sailors, as you say,

11:54.671 --> 11:55.905
are on a tear.

11:55.939 --> 11:58.074
- Navy, huh?
- Mm.

11:58.109 --> 12:00.478
Building new ships over at the west wharf.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.516
Making it hard for a man
to get his goods to market.

12:03.551 --> 12:06.253
Well, I'll steer clear of the west wharf.

12:06.288 --> 12:08.390
I like to study in quiet.

12:08.424 --> 12:10.060
Good luck.

12:11.294 --> 12:14.496
Thank you. And have fun with your books.

12:25.468 --> 12:30.159
__

12:30.525 --> 12:32.826
What a lovely cross-stitch.

12:32.861 --> 12:34.560
Isn't it lovely, Rachel?

12:34.595 --> 12:36.328
Yes, very.

12:36.362 --> 12:38.462
I'm so glad Mary invited you to join us.

12:38.497 --> 12:40.662
It was Major Hewlett's suggestion.

12:42.696 --> 12:45.166
I had... I had assumed that
Mrs. Strong was too busy

12:45.200 --> 12:47.332
to be frittering away time with us.

12:49.105 --> 12:51.971
You poor thing. You must be overwhelmed.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.373
I can only imagine how hard it
was to abandon your husband

12:55.407 --> 12:59.278
and be forced to serve as a barmaid
in the tavern he used to own.

13:03.414 --> 13:05.650
I didn't mean to sound disparaging.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.653
Honest work is honest work.

13:07.688 --> 13:10.256
No offense taken.

13:10.291 --> 13:12.658
And as for my husband,

13:12.692 --> 13:15.192
I could hardly have gone
on living with a traitor.

13:17.429 --> 13:20.066
All men are rebels at heart.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.965
It takes a strong woman to steer them

13:21.999 --> 13:24.469
<i>toward a proper understanding
of their obligations.</i>

13:24.503 --> 13:27.641
- But such is our burden.
- <i>(Women laugh)</i>

13:29.943 --> 13:32.112
I had an idea last night.

13:32.147 --> 13:34.750
I think that we should organize a charity.

13:34.784 --> 13:35.950
A charity?

13:35.984 --> 13:38.684
<i>To buy provisions for families of soldiers</i>

13:38.718 --> 13:39.986
who've died during battle

13:40.020 --> 13:41.988
such as poor Ensign Baker.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.455
What sort of provisions?

13:43.489 --> 13:45.959
Basic necessities... flour, salt,

13:45.994 --> 13:48.194
<i>good cloth, Bibles, perhaps.</i>

13:48.229 --> 13:50.430
I think that's a wonderful idea.

13:52.066 --> 13:54.367
Still, I wonder how far our money will go

13:54.402 --> 13:57.072
<i>with everything so dear these days.</i>

13:57.107 --> 13:59.477
Lydia: <i>It's a pity about the poor soldiers.</i>

13:59.511 --> 14:02.847
But more the pity for us if
our own families suffer for it.

14:05.782 --> 14:08.853
There could be a way to lighten the burden.

14:09.856 --> 14:11.858
As you all know, my employer

14:11.892 --> 14:14.728
Mr. DeJong is tight with his guineas.

14:14.762 --> 14:16.933
The man makes a vice of frugality.

14:16.968 --> 14:19.502
Which is why he also buys his rum
and supplies from a privateer.

14:19.536 --> 14:22.638
A privateer? You mean a pirate?

14:22.673 --> 14:25.707
A privateer is licensed by the British

14:25.741 --> 14:28.509
to prey on rebel shipping,
so it's all quite legal.

14:28.543 --> 14:31.312
<i>We could use Mr. DeJong's contact</i>

14:31.346 --> 14:33.180
and with the money we save,

14:33.214 --> 14:35.649
the cost of Mary's charity
could be quite manageable.

14:35.683 --> 14:38.185
I don't approve of consorting with thieves

14:38.220 --> 14:40.588
no matter what they call themselves.

14:40.622 --> 14:44.059
Surely you approve of
helping widows and orphans.

14:44.094 --> 14:46.895
(Chuckles nervously)

14:49.098 --> 14:51.233
It's settled, then.

14:53.170 --> 14:55.205
Good day, ladies.

14:55.239 --> 14:57.208
Um, Mary,

14:57.242 --> 14:59.810
has there been a delivery
of a package for me?

14:59.845 --> 15:01.277
What type of package?

15:01.312 --> 15:03.414
I've been eagerly awaiting the delivery

15:03.448 --> 15:05.751
of an item from London by way of New York.

15:05.785 --> 15:08.554
It would be quite heavy.

15:08.589 --> 15:10.522
Not yet, but I will keep an eye out for it.

15:10.557 --> 15:12.858
Thank you.

15:12.893 --> 15:16.962
And I am very pleased to see you

15:16.997 --> 15:20.263
among this august company, Mrs. Strong.

15:20.297 --> 15:21.731
Thank you, Major.

15:21.765 --> 15:23.633
I'm very pleased to be here.

15:29.371 --> 15:31.435
(Women giggle)

15:31.469 --> 15:34.339
It seems Anna has an august admirer.

15:34.374 --> 15:37.175
(laughing)

15:48.285 --> 15:49.618
Hello.

15:51.287 --> 15:53.055
Have you seen Major André?

15:53.090 --> 15:55.457
No, I'm sorry. I was at the market.

15:55.492 --> 15:56.960
I'd like to know when he'll see me.

15:56.994 --> 15:59.331
I've already been waiting an hour.

15:59.366 --> 16:01.601
I'll go find out, sir.

16:01.635 --> 16:03.402
Setauket.

16:03.437 --> 16:05.842
That's where I know you from.

16:05.876 --> 16:08.110
You were working at Strong Manor.

16:08.144 --> 16:12.346
Tell me, do you miss Long Island?

16:13.381 --> 16:14.948
No, sir.

16:14.982 --> 16:16.716
I'm happy here.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.320
I do.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.453
I can picture it in my mind even now.

16:31.663 --> 16:35.168
The last time we met, you stabbed a
man in the neck with this over dinner.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.707
An enemy spy I was hoping to turn double.

16:38.741 --> 16:41.011
Your behavior was savage.

16:41.045 --> 16:44.847
It was that same savagery, apparently,
that landed you a court-martial.

16:44.881 --> 16:46.116
Thank you, sir.

16:46.151 --> 16:47.751
There's no need to remind me of that night.

16:47.785 --> 16:49.452
It's still fresh in my mind.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.522
- But...
- Yes?

16:51.556 --> 16:55.227
I must confess to wondering why
you've summoned me here today.

16:55.261 --> 16:57.263
The Queen's Rangers lack a commander.

16:57.297 --> 17:00.099
The last murdering savage who
had that job went rogue on me,

17:00.133 --> 17:01.667
so I need a new one.

17:01.701 --> 17:03.402
<i>Someone who can bridle these men</i>

17:03.436 --> 17:06.037
and ready them for a special
mission I'm planning.

17:08.873 --> 17:12.076
<i>(Voices continue muffled)</i>

17:30.460 --> 17:32.424
A demotion?

17:32.459 --> 17:34.927
The Queen's Rangers are
provincial forces, aren't they?

17:34.962 --> 17:36.364
Don't touch that.

17:36.398 --> 17:39.335
If I accepted that post, I'd
no longer be a royal officer.

17:39.369 --> 17:42.268
You'll retain your rank, Captain.

17:42.303 --> 17:43.536
But not my uniform.

17:43.570 --> 17:45.003
And at the risk of sounding mercenary,

17:45.037 --> 17:47.240
I imagine my pay will be cut as well.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.906
<i>(Voices continue muffled)</i>

18:02.552 --> 18:04.853
Would you rather go back to the commissary?

18:04.887 --> 18:07.789
I'm offering you one last
chance at resurrection.

18:07.823 --> 18:11.958
I suppose that depends
on how you look at it.

18:11.993 --> 18:14.693
It seems to me that while murdering savages

18:14.728 --> 18:16.260
can be purchased on any corner,

18:16.294 --> 18:19.564
those that can command
other murdering savages

18:19.598 --> 18:21.200
are a rarer commodity.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.436
What do you want?

18:23.470 --> 18:26.340
Whilst we await this special mission,

18:26.374 --> 18:29.009
may I base my Rangers wherever I choose?

18:29.043 --> 18:30.610
You'll have a ship at your disposal,

18:30.644 --> 18:32.147
so as long as I can
reach out to you quickly,

18:32.181 --> 18:33.650
that shouldn't be a problem.

18:33.684 --> 18:35.721
Then consider me at your disposal.

18:35.755 --> 18:38.658
I already do. You may leave at once.

18:38.692 --> 18:41.529
Oh, and good luck with your new men.

18:41.563 --> 18:45.094
Rogers trained them to hate British
officers even more than the rebels.

18:45.128 --> 18:47.198
I suppose I'll have to charm them.

18:49.933 --> 18:51.898
Thank you, Major.

19:04.374 --> 19:07.840
I'll tell your former mistress
that you're happy here.

19:12.312 --> 19:14.580
André: <i>A detestable man.</i>

19:14.615 --> 19:18.883
But sadly sometimes such
men can serve a purpose.

19:20.552 --> 19:22.520
<i>Abigail?</i>

19:22.554 --> 19:23.788
You want something?

19:23.823 --> 19:26.590
Sir, I bought this at the market

19:26.624 --> 19:28.524
with the money you paid me.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.225
It's for my son.

19:30.260 --> 19:31.827
He's never had anything so fine.

19:31.861 --> 19:33.928
- <i>I was hoping...</i>
- Say no more.

19:33.962 --> 19:35.496
I'll have it sent out at once

19:35.531 --> 19:37.234
with a dispatch rider headed for New York.

19:37.268 --> 19:38.668
Thank you, sir.

19:38.702 --> 19:40.902
I'll wrap it up right away.

19:50.922 --> 19:52.823
Abe's voice: <i>October 16.</i>

19:57.066 --> 20:00.634
<i>My fellow boarder's tip proves well-founded.</i>

20:00.668 --> 20:03.502
<i>Heavy naval activity at the west wharf.</i>

20:10.577 --> 20:12.882
<i>Cannon emplacements at the Battery.</i>

20:12.916 --> 20:14.716
<i>Nine-pounder on a naval carriage</i>

20:14.750 --> 20:17.049
<i>and a six-pound field piece.</i>

20:42.916 --> 20:45.548
<i>October 17.</i>

20:45.582 --> 20:47.785
<i>South Ward.</i>

20:50.022 --> 20:52.556
<i>Two frigates, the 32-gun Alarm</i>

20:52.590 --> 20:55.725
<i>and 28-gun Sybil moored at Peck's Slip</i>

20:55.759 --> 20:58.227
<i>along with the 18-gun sloop Tobago.</i>

21:09.777 --> 21:11.677
<i>General Howe may have
taken most of the army,</i>

21:11.711 --> 21:13.812
<i>but he's left his mercenaries here.</i>

21:13.847 --> 21:16.718
<i>Hessians, 200 foot.</i>

21:17.986 --> 21:19.883
<i>More cannon on the Battery.</i>

21:19.917 --> 21:23.116
<i>A dozen 24-pounders and

21:23.150 --> 21:24.283
<i>Canal Street.</i>

21:24.318 --> 21:25.985
<i>Pits being dug every 50 yards,</i>

21:26.019 --> 21:27.786
<i>three or four feet deep
and lined with stakes.</i>

21:27.821 --> 21:29.320
<i>No doubt to wound men
who attempt a night attack.</i>

21:29.355 --> 21:32.223
<i>Troop barges moored at Old Slip.</i>

21:32.257 --> 21:35.658
<i>They're secured by chains and
booms to keep off fire rafts.</i>

21:45.540 --> 21:49.142
- Hello there. Ahem.
- Oh, pardon.

21:49.177 --> 21:52.945
This isn't... your room is the next one.

21:57.186 --> 21:59.021
Is, uh...

21:59.055 --> 22:01.790
is there something wrong with
the eggs I've boiled for you?

22:03.759 --> 22:05.459
No, I just...

22:05.493 --> 22:07.928
I like my eggs warm.

22:14.771 --> 22:17.305
(Exhales)

22:46.066 --> 22:48.035
<i>(knocking)</i>

22:52.307 --> 22:54.675
<i>(knocking)</i>

22:57.515 --> 22:59.214
Who is it?

22:59.249 --> 23:01.651
<i>Major Hewlett.</i>

23:06.556 --> 23:08.021
Ah, Mrs. Strong.

23:08.056 --> 23:12.024
I was afraid it would be too late,
but then I saw your light.

23:12.059 --> 23:14.425
How can I help you, Major?

23:14.459 --> 23:16.726
I have received a package

23:16.761 --> 23:19.797
from Major André from Philadelphia.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.698
I believe it to be another gift

23:21.732 --> 23:24.701
from your former slave Abigail to her son.

23:24.735 --> 23:27.866
Cicero is asleep now, but I'm sure
he'll be very excited to receive it.

23:27.901 --> 23:30.436
I thought to bring it personally
because I have some news

23:30.470 --> 23:32.004
which I think you'll be pleased to hear.

23:32.039 --> 23:34.171
Yes?

23:34.205 --> 23:38.311
Seeing you with Mrs. Woodhull's
coterie made me realize anew

23:38.345 --> 23:41.148
how difficult this ordeal
must have been for you.

23:41.182 --> 23:44.686
Forced from your home
and unable to take part

23:44.721 --> 23:47.523
in the ordinary life of the town,

23:47.557 --> 23:49.558
all by the treachery of a man

23:49.592 --> 23:54.397
whose name you have to drag
behind you like a sea anchor.

23:54.431 --> 23:57.197
So, I saw the judge.

23:57.232 --> 24:01.839
And he sees no impediment
to you securing a divorce.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.540
Oh.

24:03.575 --> 24:05.375
You can argue desertion.

24:05.409 --> 24:08.846
I hadn't considered it yet,
but here, let me...

24:08.881 --> 24:12.479
The only caveat is that it
might take more than a year.

24:12.513 --> 24:15.282
And so in the meantime, I thought

24:15.317 --> 24:18.749
that I might make you a proposal.

24:19.684 --> 24:21.586
A proposal?

24:21.621 --> 24:24.088
I of course don't mean

24:24.123 --> 24:26.953
in the formal sense of the word.

24:26.988 --> 24:29.788
I, um...

24:29.823 --> 24:33.126
thought that if perhaps you might be open

24:33.161 --> 24:36.695
to establishing a friendship.

24:36.729 --> 24:39.066
Entirely platonic, of course.

24:39.101 --> 24:40.935
"Play-tonic"?

24:40.970 --> 24:43.070
Yes, owing to the ideals of Plato

24:43.105 --> 24:45.475
that is attributed to his feelings

24:45.510 --> 24:47.411
with the prophetess Diotima.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.748
Feelings, he felt,

24:49.782 --> 24:52.253
unencumbered by the base Eros,

24:52.287 --> 24:56.221
was a surer way to the
contemplation of the divine.

24:56.256 --> 24:57.923
Major.

25:01.061 --> 25:03.030
Yes.

25:03.064 --> 25:05.333
Yes, of course.

25:05.367 --> 25:09.704
I didn't mean to presume.

25:09.739 --> 25:11.973
<i>Uh, good night.</i>

25:12.008 --> 25:14.640
Major.

25:14.674 --> 25:17.111
Abigail's gift.

25:17.145 --> 25:19.651
Oh.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.686
Yes, how foolish of me.

25:25.626 --> 25:27.263
Good night.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.973
__

26:00.953 --> 26:09.204
__

26:09.204 --> 26:11.940
Clinton: <i>Ah, a whiff of civilization.</i>

26:11.975 --> 26:16.245
- Why, it almost reminds me of Paris.
- London.

26:16.279 --> 26:18.982
Tell me about our host in case
I'm forced to converse with him.

26:19.016 --> 26:21.253
The Shippens are the cream
of Philadelphia society.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.958
This ball is their way of welcoming us.

26:23.993 --> 26:27.032
So clearly there can be no
doubt about their loyalties?

26:27.066 --> 26:28.735
Actually, it is a bit unclear.

26:28.769 --> 26:31.405
Judge Shippen opposed the
extension of royal authority,

26:31.440 --> 26:33.374
at least where taxation is concerned.

26:33.408 --> 26:37.708
But he also opposed last year's
Pennsylvania constitution.

26:37.741 --> 26:40.112
Though perhaps because it
threatened his own authority

26:40.146 --> 26:41.414
as much as the Crown's.

26:41.448 --> 26:43.549
So is the man for us or against us?

26:43.584 --> 26:47.324
Families such as the Shippens
imagine they are above us, sir.

26:47.359 --> 26:49.793
Well, above you, maybe.

26:49.827 --> 26:53.899
<i>And yet, with hair like that,
they can't help but tower.</i>

26:53.934 --> 26:55.468
It's a miracle it doesn't topple.

26:55.502 --> 26:59.205
- Who is...
- Margaret Shippen, their youngest.

26:59.239 --> 27:02.077
And as for the high roll,
it's the latest fashion.

27:02.112 --> 27:03.845
Looks French to me.

27:03.879 --> 27:06.214
Oh, there's Cornwallis.

27:06.248 --> 27:09.318
I can't resist a chance to tweak Charlie

27:09.352 --> 27:12.123
about how Washington foxed him at Trenton.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.016
A pleasure, Lieutenant.

27:29.050 --> 27:30.752
Likewise, Miss Shippen.

27:30.787 --> 27:34.925
The very instant I saw you did
my heart fly to your service.

27:34.959 --> 27:37.827
Do you quote Shakespeare to all the ladies?

27:37.861 --> 27:41.465
Only the ones that stir
a tempest in my heart.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.436
I think you do, for that was well-rehearsed.

27:44.470 --> 27:46.604
(Women giggli)

27:49.237 --> 27:51.535
At least they don't kiss
in the continental style.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.004
It disorders one's high roll,

27:53.039 --> 27:55.475
and I've already put poor
Freddy through enough today.

27:55.509 --> 27:58.312
Have a care, Peggy. You'll
scare off all the eligible men.

27:58.346 --> 28:02.052
- Freddy: She's right.
- That's because to Becky all men are eligible.

28:02.087 --> 28:04.321
And I expect when we're her
age, we'll feel the same.

28:04.355 --> 28:06.223
- Thank you, Becky.
- You're welcome, Becky.

28:06.257 --> 28:07.692
By the time I'm Miss Redman's age,

28:07.726 --> 28:09.963
I expect to be on my second husband.

28:09.997 --> 28:11.731
Ever the romantic.

28:11.765 --> 28:14.668
But first you may want to find number one.

28:14.702 --> 28:18.374
And who would you pick, Freddy,
from this pool of too eager candidates?

28:18.408 --> 28:21.245
I guess that depends on
what one looks for in a man.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.283
If I were Peggy,

28:23.317 --> 28:26.654
I would choose someone

28:26.688 --> 28:29.424
tall and dashing.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.831
Maybe someone with an elegant little braid.

28:32.865 --> 28:34.799
Then again, I'm sure our Peggy is immune

28:34.834 --> 28:37.938
to such superficial inducements.

28:44.346 --> 28:46.346
Why, Peggy, he didn't even smile at you.

28:46.380 --> 28:50.385
A man immune to the
charms of Margaret Shippen.

28:50.420 --> 28:51.986
What has the world come to?

28:52.021 --> 28:54.320
I suspect he's more Freddy's type after all.

28:54.354 --> 28:56.089
One can dream.

28:57.226 --> 28:59.030
It's your deal, Becky.

28:59.966 --> 29:01.435
Age before beauty.

29:01.469 --> 29:02.870
Youth before wisdom.

29:02.904 --> 29:05.140
I'll deal.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.984
Now what is that infernal man doing?

29:14.087 --> 29:16.023
(Playing up-tempo music)

29:16.057 --> 29:18.122
Killing the ambiance, apparently.

29:22.662 --> 29:24.927
Not so, apparently.

29:42.340 --> 29:45.172
Major John André at your service, ladies.

29:45.207 --> 29:47.439
What service are you offering, Major?

29:47.473 --> 29:48.972
Why, a dance, of course.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.409
May I have the pleasure?

30:02.855 --> 30:05.623
May I have the pleasure, Miss Franks?

30:16.103 --> 30:18.436
General, I heard a rumor

30:18.470 --> 30:20.871
that you can lead a minuet
as expertly as a charge.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.673
- Is it true?
- Perhaps.

30:22.707 --> 30:24.841
But would your father approve, Miss Shippen?

30:24.875 --> 30:26.675
Do you require his approval?

30:26.710 --> 30:28.810
I thought you were the
highest authority in this room

30:28.844 --> 30:30.678
if not this city.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.518
(Music continues)

31:06.150 --> 31:09.049
- <i>(music ends)</i>
- (Applause)

31:15.056 --> 31:17.827
<i>(music resumes)</i>

31:25.371 --> 31:27.170
Major André.

31:27.204 --> 31:29.105
Miss Shippen.

31:29.139 --> 31:31.209
So you know my name after all.

31:31.243 --> 31:33.179
I know your family quite well.

31:33.214 --> 31:35.116
Or of them anyway.

31:35.150 --> 31:37.386
And I know nothing of you.

31:37.420 --> 31:39.656
Except perhaps that you
asked my friend to dance

31:39.690 --> 31:42.225
in an attempt to induce jealousy.

31:42.260 --> 31:45.462
Do you really think women
are so easily manipulated?

31:45.497 --> 31:46.966
We're dancing, aren't we?

31:47.000 --> 31:50.801
There's a fine line between
confidence and arrogance, Major.

31:50.835 --> 31:52.935
I'm sure you'll tell me if I cross it.

31:52.970 --> 31:56.072
I'm reserving judgment.

31:56.106 --> 32:00.638
Still, why not aim directly
at what you're after?

32:00.672 --> 32:03.810
When I saw you turn away other men,
I knew a stratagem was called for.

32:03.844 --> 32:06.578
If not to pique your jealousy,
then at least your curiosity.

32:06.612 --> 32:08.613
You like to play games, don't you?

32:08.647 --> 32:09.715
As do you.

32:09.749 --> 32:11.219
This may be a game to a man,

32:11.253 --> 32:13.219
but to a woman, the stakes are very real.

32:14.321 --> 32:16.091
Even to a very lovely young woman?

32:16.125 --> 32:18.192
A woman's allure rests on her saying no.

32:18.226 --> 32:21.462
But no matter how lovely,
she can only say no for so long

32:21.496 --> 32:24.799
or she ends up like my poor
Becky, an old maid at 26.

32:24.833 --> 32:26.600
<i>(Music ends)</i>

32:26.635 --> 32:28.202
You may have won this dance, Major,

32:28.236 --> 32:30.737
but who's to say there'll be another?

32:30.770 --> 32:34.639
Is this the fate of every
man to fall under your spell?

32:34.673 --> 32:37.172
One whirl around the dance
floor and then oblivion?

32:37.207 --> 32:39.542
How many others do you
think there have been?

32:39.576 --> 32:41.945
I won't hazard a guess,
but I'm sure you entertained

32:41.979 --> 32:44.114
some rebel officers before we came to town.

32:44.148 --> 32:47.017
More tolerated than entertained.

32:48.653 --> 32:52.122
What about that scamp who gave
us so much trouble at Saratoga?

32:52.156 --> 32:54.525
Benedict Arnold.

32:54.559 --> 32:56.760
I hear he once stayed at your house.

32:56.795 --> 32:58.962
When I was 14.

32:58.997 --> 33:00.798
If my eyes are any judge,

33:00.832 --> 33:03.334
I imagine he must still think of you.

33:03.368 --> 33:05.538
Do you?

33:06.741 --> 33:09.340
I wonder, what games are we playing now?

33:11.909 --> 33:13.309
<i>(Music resumes)</i>

33:13.344 --> 33:15.412
Boccherini's minuet.

33:15.446 --> 33:17.347
Dare I request another dance?

33:20.284 --> 33:22.285
Just one more, perhaps.

33:30.906 --> 33:33.108
No breakfast? You paid for it.

33:33.142 --> 33:36.111
Uh, no. I can't, I'm afraid. Long trip back.

33:36.145 --> 33:37.579
Best be on my way.

33:37.614 --> 33:40.246
How about some bread for the road?

33:40.280 --> 33:42.345
Fine.

33:44.215 --> 33:46.184
Let's see.

33:46.218 --> 33:48.485
Here you go.

33:48.519 --> 33:50.355
Law studies off to a good start?

33:50.389 --> 33:52.091
I hope so.

33:52.125 --> 33:53.593
It's not really for me to judge.

33:53.627 --> 33:55.429
<i>For a man cocooned with his books,</i>

33:55.463 --> 33:57.964
you managed quite a sunburn.

34:00.333 --> 34:02.266
Old habits, I suppose.

34:02.301 --> 34:04.836
I was a farmer before I took up the law.

34:04.870 --> 34:06.906
I thought why waste the
whole of a lovely day indoors

34:06.940 --> 34:09.007
when I could be out committing
my case to memory?

34:09.042 --> 34:10.877
Thank you.

34:10.911 --> 34:12.411
I had a lovely stay.

34:12.447 --> 34:15.847
And I expect I'll be back soon.

34:18.954 --> 34:21.558
- (Chatter)
- <i>(Seagulls screeching)</i>

34:29.828 --> 34:31.694
You look like the cat that ate the cream.

34:31.728 --> 34:33.261
I think the law agrees with me.

34:33.295 --> 34:35.996
I'm glad someone enjoyed himself.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.034
Well, you keep dreaming of
holy ground, Mr. Eastin.

34:39.068 --> 34:40.802
Someday you'll get your just reward.

34:40.835 --> 34:44.206
Hold on there. Need to see those bags first.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.944
Right.

34:47.214 --> 34:48.847
There you go.

34:56.121 --> 34:58.053
What's this?

34:58.088 --> 35:00.589
- Lunch.
- Let's see it.

35:01.492 --> 35:03.226
If you must.

35:06.993 --> 35:09.094
Looks like someone's robbed the henhouse.

35:09.129 --> 35:10.830
Can you spare a couple?

35:12.965 --> 35:14.533
Help yourself.

35:14.568 --> 35:17.405
Just avoid the brown ones,
though. They're a little sour.

35:17.440 --> 35:21.143
What brown ones? All
right, then. Off you go.

35:24.014 --> 35:27.015
- Hyah. Hyah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

35:28.152 --> 35:29.720
I think I left something in my room.

35:29.754 --> 35:33.227
I don't want to risk getting
caught after dark. Hey!

35:43.141 --> 35:45.376
(Panting)

35:48.083 --> 35:50.216
Back already?

35:50.250 --> 35:51.684
Yeah.

35:51.718 --> 35:53.721
I think I left something in my room.

35:53.755 --> 35:56.795
It's already been rented out.

35:58.431 --> 36:01.432
- Oh.
- You don't look well, sir.

36:18.618 --> 36:22.854
Here you go. I still owe you breakfast.

36:22.888 --> 36:24.623
I didn't order this.

36:24.657 --> 36:28.292
I know, but you didn't stick to
your porridge either, did you?

36:41.502 --> 36:44.169
I wondered if you could hard-boil
a dozen of these for me.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.671
Owner: <i>How about some bread for the road?</i>

36:47.705 --> 36:50.202
Abe: <i>Fine.</i>

36:55.140 --> 36:58.441
<i>(heart beating)</i>

37:09.545 --> 37:10.978
It was hard-boiled.

37:11.012 --> 37:14.480
That one had a bitter taste.
I couldn't serve it.

37:14.515 --> 37:16.348
Then why did you take it in the first place?

37:16.383 --> 37:18.720
Would you rather I had
served it to that gentleman?

37:28.467 --> 37:33.104
I'm sorry, I... I never got your name.

37:33.138 --> 37:37.539
The name's Townsend. Robert Townsend.

37:37.574 --> 37:40.845
And I don't care to see you here again.

38:00.026 --> 38:01.661
Hey, boy.

38:03.096 --> 38:04.898
Boy.

38:04.933 --> 38:06.835
My name ain't boy.

38:06.870 --> 38:08.970
You calling me a liar, boy?

38:10.806 --> 38:13.943
Oh, yeah, it's Aak... Aak-in-balls, right?

38:13.977 --> 38:16.445
Akinbode.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.446
Major Rogers' pet monkey.

38:18.480 --> 38:19.746
You and that Indian.

38:19.780 --> 38:21.684
What was his damn name?

38:21.719 --> 38:23.122
- Awass-hole.
- Awass-hole.

38:23.156 --> 38:25.692
Aak-in-balls and Awass-hole, that's right.

38:25.727 --> 38:27.895
Only the Indian left when Rogers did.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.634
But you're still here.
Why are you here, boy?

38:30.668 --> 38:33.635
I earned my place just like the rest of you.

38:33.669 --> 38:36.169
Right.

38:36.204 --> 38:38.304
You're good with sticks.

38:39.272 --> 38:41.072
Take it.

38:41.106 --> 38:43.407
<i>Go on.</i>

38:47.743 --> 38:51.149
See if I don't add your
scalp to my friends here.

38:53.384 --> 38:55.517
- Man: <i> All right, Cager.</i>
- <i>(Chatter)</i>

39:00.058 --> 39:01.859
Whoa.

39:03.329 --> 39:05.063
Well, what have we here?

39:05.097 --> 39:07.398
If you're looking for Philadelphia,

39:07.433 --> 39:09.167
head to the river and make a right.

39:09.201 --> 39:11.136
- <i>(Men laugh)</i>
- Thank you.

39:11.170 --> 39:13.138
But I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

39:13.172 --> 39:16.343
My name is Captain John Graves Simcoe

39:16.377 --> 39:20.947
and I'm your new commander by
orders of Major John André.

39:23.584 --> 39:25.952
That's a nice hat you
got there, your lordship.

39:25.987 --> 39:28.455
<i>But it might get a little dirty where we go.</i>

39:28.489 --> 39:30.188
- (men laugh)
- Trust me,

39:30.222 --> 39:32.591
I've no more desire to
lead a provincial force

39:32.626 --> 39:34.793
than you have to serve
under a royal officer.

39:34.827 --> 39:39.964
These are my orders and
yours are to obey mine.

39:39.998 --> 39:42.632
If you do, I promise to mold you

39:42.666 --> 39:45.768
into the finest light infantry in the land.

39:45.802 --> 39:48.037
Now...

39:48.071 --> 39:50.339
let's line up and fall in.

39:58.883 --> 40:01.553
I think what they're saying, Captain,

40:01.587 --> 40:03.987
<i>by not saying sod,</i>

40:04.022 --> 40:06.791
is why should we obey a fop

40:06.826 --> 40:08.560
in silly togs?

40:08.594 --> 40:10.260
I take it, then, that you already know

40:10.294 --> 40:11.995
all there is to know about fighting.

40:12.030 --> 40:14.500
More than you, dandelion.

40:28.115 --> 40:31.052
Then kill me, if you can.

40:34.155 --> 40:36.725
You worry about the consequences, I see.

40:36.759 --> 40:38.960
But who would ever know
all the way out here?

40:38.994 --> 40:42.061
You could kill me and then stuff
my body in some animal's burrow

40:42.096 --> 40:43.965
<i>and say you never saw me.</i>

40:44.000 --> 40:47.501
That is, of course, if you can kill me.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.021
(Grunts)

41:03.055 --> 41:06.127
- (cracks)
- (Screams)

41:06.162 --> 41:08.396
(grunts)

41:08.430 --> 41:11.068
- (groans)
- Thank you.

41:12.336 --> 41:13.736
(Screams)

41:13.770 --> 41:16.236
One more for your collection.

41:22.477 --> 41:25.647
Now then, where were we?

41:27.850 --> 41:29.515
No!

41:30.984 --> 41:33.052
(Groaning)

41:34.254 --> 41:36.123
My hope, of course,

41:36.157 --> 41:39.727
is that our lessons
won't have to be repeated.

41:39.762 --> 41:40.761
<i>(Pistol cocks)</i>

41:40.796 --> 41:43.164
(gunshot)

41:52.241 --> 41:56.875
Now, let's try this again.

42:03.548 --> 42:05.382
Fall in.
