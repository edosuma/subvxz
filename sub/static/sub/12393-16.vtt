male announcer:
LAST SEASON ON PSYCH...

00:03.130 --> 00:05.360
- MR. YANG IS THE MOST
NOTORIOUS KILLER

00:05.400 --> 00:06.537
THIS CITY HAS NEVER SEEN.

00:06.570 --> 00:08.037
HE ONLY RESURFACES
WHEN HE FEELS

00:08.070 --> 00:09.037
THERE'S A WORTHY OPPONENT.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.367
- THAT IS MARY LIGHTLY.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.275
HE'S VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE PATTERNS OF OUR KILLER.

00:12.310 --> 00:13.675
- QUESTION REGARDING
THE WHOLE MARY THING.

00:13.710 --> 00:14.938
- MY FATHER'S NAME WAS MARY,

00:14.980 --> 00:16.572
HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM
WAS NAMED MARY,

00:16.610 --> 00:18.100
AND HIS FATHER
BEFORE HIM WAS NAMED CRAIG.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.811
- I FORBID YOU TO BE
A PART OF THIS, SHAWN.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.147
THIS GUY KNOWS ABOUT YOU.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.784
HE KNOWS ABOUT
EVERYBODY YOU CARE ABOUT.

00:22.820 --> 00:24.310
- HE'S GOT MY MOM.

00:24.350 --> 00:25.510
- THIS SWITCH HAS
SUCH A LIGHT TOUCH,

00:25.550 --> 00:26.517
AND THEN BOOM!

00:26.560 --> 00:27.709
- YOU'RE GONNA ROT IN A CELL

00:27.760 --> 00:29.057
WITH FOUR PADDED WALLS--
THE END.

00:29.090 --> 00:31.024
- NO, I'M GONNA WRITE A BOOK.
OUR STORY.

00:31.060 --> 00:32.027
- GUESS I HAVE
TO FIND A NEW HOBBY.

00:32.060 --> 00:33.698
- TOURS, RACQUETBALL.

00:33.730 --> 00:34.822
- THAT COULD WORK.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.564
- ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,
LAST CHANCE.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.261
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THIS
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

00:40.300 --> 00:42.336
THE LITTLE MERMAID.
WITHOUT GUS?

00:42.370 --> 00:44.964
- YEAH, APPARENTLY GUS
HAS A STRANGE AVERSION

00:45.010 --> 00:46.102
TO RENE AUBERJONOIS.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.801
IT'S A BENSON THING.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.001
- YOU REALLY WANT
TO SEE THIS FLICK?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.677
- DAD, DON'T SAY "FLICK."

00:51.710 --> 00:53.712
AND I'M BARELY
TICKLING ADOLESCENCE.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.570
WHY DO YOU WANT ME
TO GROW UP SO FAST?

00:55.620 --> 00:57.485
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, SHAWN,
I KNOW THE RUNNING TIME.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.114
I'M GONNA BE BACK HERE
IN EXACTLY 116 MINUTES.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.513
- AWESOME.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.879
[car door slams]

01:04.390 --> 01:06.199
BYE, DAD!

01:15.570 --> 01:18.368
[shower running]

01:18.410 --> 01:20.401
[whispering]
IS THAT YOU?

01:23.110 --> 01:25.499
- OH, 'SCUSE ME.

01:25.550 --> 01:26.619
- JUST HURRY.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.447
- OH, AHEM.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.744
JUST KISS THE KNEES IN
A TOUCH, GUYS. THANKS.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.041
YOU'RE VERY SWEET,
BOTH OF YOU.

01:32.090 --> 01:33.318
[drink spills]
YOUR DRINK. I'M--

01:33.360 --> 01:35.385
THAT'S MY BAD.
I'M SORRY.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.957
THAT'S JUST AWK--
AWIQNARD.

01:37.990 --> 01:39.196
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

01:39.230 --> 01:40.629
YOU MISSED THE FIRST THIRD
OF THE MOVIE.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.125
AND A MOMMY COMPLEX.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.491
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS THE SHOWER SCENE.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.304
WAIT FOR IIIT...

01:49.340 --> 01:50.534
[screeching music]

01:50.570 --> 01:52.629
all: AAH!

01:52.680 --> 01:54.033
- DID YOU KNOW
THAT HITCHCOCK APPEARED

01:54.080 --> 01:55.308
IN ALL OF HIS FILMS?

01:55.340 --> 01:56.546
- EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.605
- BUT DID YOU KNOW
THAT HE WAS ALSO OBSESSED

01:58.650 --> 02:00.845
WITH WOMEN'S JAPANESE
HOUSEHOLD SLIPPERS?

02:00.880 --> 02:02.518
WORE THEM EVERYWHERE,
EVEN TO BED.

02:02.550 --> 02:04.188
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

02:04.220 --> 02:06.017
IT'S PART OF A NEW BIT
I'M WORKING ON

02:06.050 --> 02:09.178
CALLED COMPLETELY RANDOM,
UNTRUE TRIVIA.

02:09.230 --> 02:13.451
MARY...LIGHTLY.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.456
- YOU GUYS LIKE PIE?

02:15.500 --> 02:18.560
* OOH, BABY, IT'S TRUE

02:18.600 --> 02:19.692
WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD,

02:19.740 --> 02:22.800
MY MOTHER GAVE ME
MY FIRST HAIRCUT.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.807
- HERE'S YOUR MILK,
DOLL FACE.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.206
- THANK YOU.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.207
- MARY, YOU SEEM DISTURBED.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.379
EVEN MORE SO THAN USUAL.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.549
I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK,
BUT WHY DON'T YOU TELL US

02:31.580 --> 02:33.741
WHAT'S REALLY ON YOUR MIND?

02:33.780 --> 02:37.238
- I'M ASSUMING
YOU'VE READ THIS.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.086
- [laughing]
ARE YOU KIDDING?

02:38.120 --> 02:39.485
WE'RE IN IT.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.408
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
AND I AM PARAPHRASING HERE,

02:41.460 --> 02:43.018
I'M INTRODUCED ON PAGE 11

02:43.060 --> 02:45.824
AS A THICK-TUFI'ED BOY GENIUS
WHO ICE SKATES THROUGH LIFE

02:45.860 --> 02:47.725
ON POLISHED BLADES
OF SNARKY ELOQUENCE.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.421
- THAT IS AN EXACT QUOTE, SHAWN.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.062
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT I WAS DESCRIBED AS?

02:51.100 --> 02:53.193
- LAUGHING ON THE OUTSIDE,
CRYING ON THE INSIDE,

02:53.240 --> 02:55.629
THE FASTIDIOUS WRINKLE
ON THE BROW OF PSYCH.

02:55.670 --> 02:56.807
- TRUE, BUT SHE ALSO SAID

02:56.840 --> 02:59.308
YOU HAD SKIN OF PURE
COCOA VELVETINESS.

02:59.340 --> 03:01.274
- SHE ALSO SHE WOULD LIKE
TO USE THAT SKIN

03:01.310 --> 03:02.504
TO MAKE CHILDREN'S DOLLS.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.972
- I'D BUY THAT DOLL.

03:04.010 --> 03:04.977
THE POINT IS, SHAWN,
YOU KNOW YANG

03:05.010 --> 03:06.318
ALMOST AS WELL AS I DO.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.238
YOU'RE THE ONLY OTHER PERSON
WHO WOULD KNOW

03:08.280 --> 03:10.316
THAT NONE OF THIS
IS POSSIBLE.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.688
COME ON, SHAWN,
THE PROJECT IONIST.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.052
WE DIDN'T GET TO THE DRIVE-IN
TILL 11:26.

03:16.090 --> 03:18.320
HOW WOULD YANG HAVE HAD
THE TIME TO DO ALL THAT

03:18.360 --> 03:20.749
AND STRAPPED YOUR MOTHER DOWN
WITH INCENDIARY EXPLOSIVES?

03:20.800 --> 03:22.961
- LOOK, MARY...

03:23.000 --> 03:25.195
I KNOW THAT YANG
WAS A BIG PART OF YOUR LIFE.

03:25.230 --> 03:27.994
BUT SHE IS BEHIND
ELECTRONIC GATES NOW,

03:28.040 --> 03:31.100
AND SHE CAN'T
HURT ANYONE ANYMORE.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.608
- YANG WASN'T WORKING ALONE.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.610
- YOU DIDN'T GIVE RACQUETBALL
A FAIR SHAKE, DID YOU?

03:40.650 --> 03:43.118
- I WILL NOT WEAR
SHORT PANTS, SHAWN.

03:43.150 --> 03:46.085
- I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO GO HOME, MARY.
- YES.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.815
- I AM HOME.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.418
I LIVE HERE.

03:49.460 --> 03:50.552
- SAY WHAT?

03:50.590 --> 03:51.682
- I NEVER LEFI' SANTA BARBARA.

03:51.730 --> 03:54.528
I'VE BEEN HERE
SINCE WE CAUGHT YANG.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.597
[both mumbling indistinctly]

03:57.630 --> 03:59.120
- NO, NO, NO!

04:00.070 --> 04:01.492
- YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD US.

04:01.540 --> 04:04.407
- WE WOULD HAVE GO'I'I'EN YOU
A HOUSE CHILLING GIFI'.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.001
A BELATED WELCOME TO YOU,
AND FOREVER GOOD-BYE.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.701
- DON'T DO, SHAWN.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.968
YOU WILL REGRET IT.

04:13.450 --> 04:14.974
- GOOD LUCK AT THE CREEPY
ARM GRAB AWARDS

04:15.020 --> 04:16.009
THIS YEAR, MARY.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.915
I THINK YOU HAVE
A REAL SHOT...

04:17.950 --> 04:19.588
AT WINNING.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.383
- [sighs]

04:34.800 --> 04:36.438
- [sighs]

04:46.350 --> 04:50.184
[cell phone ringing]

04:52.120 --> 04:53.314
[beep]

04:57.860 --> 04:59.748
- SHAWN, THANKS
FOR COMING OUT HERE.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.825
WE THINK THAT THIS
JUST HAPPENED,

05:01.860 --> 05:03.623
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
TO GET PSYCHICALLY,

05:03.670 --> 05:06.195
I WANTED YOU TO TAKE A LOOK
WHILE THINGS ARE STILL FRESH.

05:06.230 --> 05:07.663
- WHAT HAPPENED?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.099
- IT ISN'T PRETTY.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.563
- THE VICTIM'S
A CAUCASIAN FEMALE,

05:11.610 --> 05:14.101
APPROXIMATE AGE, MID-40$.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.402
- STRANGLED,

05:15.440 --> 05:17.271
DROPPED HERE
LIKE A SACK OF POTATOES.

05:18.850 --> 05:20.147
BODY'S STILL WARM.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.612
- I KNOW.

05:22.650 --> 05:24.015
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, GUSTER?

05:24.050 --> 05:26.245
FORGET TO TAKE
YOUR CRIME SCENE PILLS?

05:26.290 --> 05:28.053
- GUS?

05:28.090 --> 05:30.024
DO YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN?

05:30.060 --> 05:32.028
- SHE SERVED US OUR PIE.

05:32.060 --> 05:33.823
- WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN--

05:33.860 --> 05:35.521
SHE SERVED YOU YOUR PIE?

05:49.140 --> 05:51.449
- SHAWN...WHAT IS IT?

06:05.830 --> 06:09.664
[upbeat rock music]

06:09.700 --> 06:11.691
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:11.730 --> 06:13.391
* THAT I'M NOT
TELLING THE TRUTH *

06:13.440 --> 06:14.930
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:14.970 --> 06:16.437
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

06:16.470 --> 06:18.108
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

06:18.140 --> 06:20.131
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

06:20.180 --> 06:21.636
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

06:21.680 --> 06:23.944
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

06:23.980 --> 06:26.005
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:33.260 --> 06:34.818
- ALL RIGHT, MARY,
YOU WERE THE LAST CUSTOMER

06:34.860 --> 06:35.884
IN THIS PLACE LAST NIGHT.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.955
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER SEEING?

06:36.990 --> 06:38.252
- NOTHING--
SHE BROUGHT GUS'S MILK,

06:38.290 --> 06:39.450
AND I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.092
I COULDN'T EVEN FIND HER
TO PAY THE BILL.

06:41.130 --> 06:42.358
- WAIT, YOU DIDN'T
PAY THE CHECK?

06:42.400 --> 06:43.719
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO MY $20?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.021
- I FOLDED IT
INTO A TINY SAILOR'S HAT

06:45.070 --> 06:47.436
FOR A SPECIAL FRIEND.

06:47.470 --> 06:48.459
- AHH.

06:56.410 --> 06:57.877
- UHH!

06:57.910 --> 06:59.810
HERE WE GO.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.249
- IT'S YANG.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.838
- SHE'S IN JAIL.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.108
- INDEED,
THIS IS THE WORK OF YIN.

07:05.150 --> 07:07.482
BACK OFF,
THIS CAN GET STICKY.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.028
[mumbling] OKAY...

07:13.060 --> 07:14.288
- WHAT IS THAT?

07:14.330 --> 07:17.265
- CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.632
- IT'S FROM YESTERDAY'S PAPER.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.638
THERE'S TWO CLUES HIGHLIGHTED.
12 DOWN AND 6 ACROSS.

07:21.670 --> 07:24.264
"A GOOD MAN
IS HARD TO BLANK.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.107
BLANK, MYSELF, AND I."

07:26.140 --> 07:27.129
- I GOT IT!

07:27.180 --> 07:30.069
A GOOD MAN
IS HARD TO FIND.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.203
ME, MYSELF, AND I.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.674
THE ANSWER IS "FIND ME."

07:35.720 --> 07:37.210
- I THINK THAT BAILIFF
FROM NIGHT COURT

07:37.250 --> 07:38.239
IS SPOT-ON.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.155
- PERFECT, WE CAN START BY--

07:40.190 --> 07:41.817
- NO, JULES,
WE DON'T START, PERIOD.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.657
YOU GUYS WANT
ANOTHER CRIME SCENE?

07:43.690 --> 07:44.679
YOU WANT ANOTHER DEAD BODY?

07:44.730 --> 07:46.220
GO AHEAD, ENGAGE.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.228
BUT WE CAN'T
PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.898
- OH, SPENCER, I WISH
I HAD THE LUXURY

07:49.930 --> 07:51.818
NOT TO FOLLOW A LEAD
IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.565
- FINE, YOU DO
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.862
GUS AND I ARE GOING
STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE.

07:54.900 --> 07:55.867
- WHAT?

07:55.900 --> 07:58.607
- MARY...
YOU COMING OR WHAT?

08:00.440 --> 08:03.603
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT
IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION?

08:03.650 --> 08:04.969
FEELS REDUNDANT.
GUS?

08:05.010 --> 08:06.238
- I SMELL CRAZY.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.838
- I CRAVE SWEET,
SWEET MUSHROOMS.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.869
- AND WHY ARE WE
WEARING THESE?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.239
- IT'S A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.554
SHE GETS OVERLY STIMULATED
BY COLOR.

08:12.590 --> 08:14.854
- WHAT ABOUT MY FACE?

08:20.400 --> 08:22.027
- SHAWN.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.359
- I KNEW YOU'D COME.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.029
- SHE'S CUTE, RIGHT?

08:31.070 --> 08:32.401
I GOT THE GOOGLEY EYES
FOR HER,

08:32.440 --> 08:33.600
BUT SHE'S PLAYING
HARD TO GET.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.575
[giggIeSJ

08:36.610 --> 08:38.407
[whispering]
OKAY, I CAN'T STAND IT
ANY MORE.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.111
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE BOOK?

08:40.150 --> 08:42.118
- HON ESTLY?

08:42.150 --> 08:43.378
I THOUGHT BRUCE CAMPBELL'S
WAS BETTER.

08:43.420 --> 08:46.139
WE'RE HERE TO ASK YOU
ONE, SIMPLE QUESTION.

08:46.190 --> 08:47.714
- THE ANSWER IS YES, SHAWN,

08:47.760 --> 08:49.113
THEY DO ALLOW
CONJUGAL VISITS.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.378
BUT I THINK WE'D HAVE
TO GET MARRIED FIRST.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.091
- I AM A FULLY-ORDAINED
MINISTER.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.995
- THAT'S THE MOST DISGUSTING
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

08:55.030 --> 08:57.225
- MARY HERE SEEMS TO THINK
THAT YOU ARE NOT

08:57.270 --> 09:00.364
THE SOLE MASTERMIND
BEHIND THIS NASTY VENTURE.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.095
- I DON'T THINK, SHAWN,
I KNOW.

09:02.140 --> 09:05.462
- DO YOU, MARY,
QUITE CONTRARY?

09:08.080 --> 09:10.878
DO YOU NOW?

09:14.750 --> 09:16.684
OKAY, SHAWN.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.659
I THINK WE CAN
HELP EACH OTHER OUT.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.282
- THIS ISN'T
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, OKAY?

09:21.320 --> 09:22.856
- IT'S TOTALLY
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

09:22.890 --> 09:23.857

FRANKIE FAISON.

09:23.890 --> 09:25.221
- I KNOW.
- FINE.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.421
WE'RE GONNA CATCH THIS SICKO
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

09:27.460 --> 09:28.825
I JUST THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU
ONE SHOT AT REDEMPTION.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.896
- MAKE NO MISTAKE: YOU'RE
GOING TO HELL EITHER WAY.

09:30.930 --> 09:34.058
- SPEAK NOW,
OR WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

TO HER YANG.

09:54.690 --> 09:58.251
YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHIN' YET.

09:58.290 --> 09:59.450
- WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

09:59.490 --> 10:00.718
- RETRACING OUR STEPS.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.194
WE WERE HERE LAST NIGHT
FOR THE HITCHCOCK FESTIVAL.

10:03.230 --> 10:04.822
IT WAS A TRIPLE FEATURE.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.895
- GUSTER, I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY MOVIES YOU SAW.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.931
SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING?

10:08.970 --> 10:10.107
- SHH!

10:15.410 --> 10:18.447
- THERE'S TWO CLUES HIGHLIGHTED.
12 DOWN, 6 ACROSS.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.540
- 12 DOWN.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.810
6 ACROSS.

10:23.850 --> 10:26.819
HE WAS HERE!

10:26.860 --> 10:29.283
12 DOWN, 6 ACROSS.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.049
HE WAS SITTING RIGHT THERE.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.149
- I THINK WE WERE
IN THE SAME ROW.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.155
- WELL, THEN YOU MUST
HAVE SEEN HIM.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.327
WHAT DID HF LOOK LIKE?

10:36.360 --> 10:38.624
- JUST HURRY.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.991
- OH, YOUR DRINK.
I'M...THAT'S MY BAD.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.064
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

SO NOW YOU'LL
HAVE TO PLAY CATCH-UP."

10:51.280 --> 10:52.542
- YOU TWO NEED TO GO BACK
AND SEE YANG.

10:52.580 --> 10:55.219
- NO, SHE IS NOT...
THE PUPPET MASTER ANYMORE.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.478
OKAY?
YIN IS WORKING ALONE.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.340
- WELL, THEN, MARY,
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT YIN?

10:58.390 --> 10:59.857
WHAT'S HIS GAME?
- THERE IS NO GAME.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.051
IT'S THE LAW OF OPPOSITES,
OKAY?

11:02.090 --> 11:04.388
YANG HAD RULES--
THE TICKING CLOCK,

11:04.430 --> 11:06.523
THE KEEN RHYMING SCHEMES,
NOTHING BUT ORDER.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.721
YIN, NOTHING BUT CHAOS.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.318
AND YOU CAN BET
YOUR SAN DY BOTTOM

11:10.370 --> 11:13.191
THAT AS SOON AS YOU
FIGURE OUT THE RULES,

11:13.240 --> 11:14.696
THEY'LL CHANGE.

11:14.740 --> 11:15.889
- LET'S GO TO THE MOVIES!

11:15.940 --> 11:17.202
- SERIOUSLY,
NOT AGAIN, GUSTER.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.832
I'M NOT GONNA WATCH YOU
ACT LIKE A COURT JESTER

WE WERE HERE LAST NIGHT,

11:26.310 --> 11:28.517
OUR CLUES ARE GONNA BE FOUND
IN HITCHCOCK FILMS.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.939

11:30.990 --> 11:33.686

A LOT OF CINEMA TO COVER.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.551

TRY AND FIND SOMETHING.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.818
YOU DIDN'T SEE HIS FACE,

12:10.860 --> 12:14.125
BUT YOU CAN PICK UP
ON SOMETHING.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.464
- YOU CAN DO IT, SHAWN.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.367
THE FEET, THE SHOES.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.435
SOMETHING.

12:25.340 --> 12:27.934
- SPENCER! I'M COLD!

12:27.980 --> 12:30.039

THE PROJECT IONIST.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.886
WE DIDN'T GET TO THE DRIVE-IN
TILL 11:26.

12:45.930 --> 12:48.524
HOW WOULD YANG HAVE HAD
THE TIME TO DO ALL THAT?

12:54.540 --> 12:56.804
COME ON, SHAWN.
IT'S ME.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.569
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ME.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.600
- I DON'T THINK WE'RE
SPEAKING TO THE MOUSE.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.402
THE MOUSE IS SPEAKING TO YOU.

13:05.450 --> 13:08.977
I DON'T THINK, SHAWN.
I KNOW.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.088
I KNOW WHO YIN IS.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.107
- MR. SPENCER,
THIS IS OUTLANDISH.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.300
- JUST HEAR HIM OUT.

13:33.340 --> 13:35.001
- MARY LIGHTLY
ALL BUT CONFESSED

13:35.040 --> 13:37.372
TO GUS AND I WHEN HE SAID
THAT HE HAD SPENT

13:37.410 --> 13:39.776
THE LAST 13 YEARS
OF HIS LIFE WITH YANG

13:39.810 --> 13:42.847
AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS
GOING TO DO WITHOUT HER.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.539
- MR. SPENCER,
I HAVE TO ASK:

13:44.590 --> 13:47.889
WHY ARE YOU JUST NOW
RECEIVING THESE PSYCHIC SIGNALS?

13:47.920 --> 13:48.989
WHY DIDN'T YOU TAG MARY
AS A SUSPECT

13:49.020 --> 13:50.055
THE LAST TIME AROUND?

13:50.090 --> 13:51.227
- HE DID.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.386
IT WAS THE FIRST THING HE SAID
WHEN HE SAW HIM.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.125
- OH, HE WAS JUST BEING
FLIPPANT AND JACKASSY.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.957
- LOOK, I THINK OUR TRACK RECORD
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.160
WE CAN EITHER
DO THIS TOGETHER,

13:57.200 --> 13:58.269
OR WE CAN FOLLOW YOU AROUND

13:58.300 --> 13:59.722
AND CONDUCT OUR OWN
INVESTIGATION.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.003
- ALL RIGHT, MR. SPENCER.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.905
BUT YOU'RE ON
A VERY SHORT LEASH.

14:05.940 --> 14:08.431
HOW DO YOU SUGGEST
THAT WE PROCEED?

14:08.480 --> 14:09.777
- KEEPING IN MIND,
OF COURSE,

14:09.810 --> 14:11.368
WE HAVEN'T A SHRED
OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

14:11.410 --> 14:12.604

14:12.650 --> 14:14.709
- NOTHING?
HOW SEINFELDIAN.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.479
- CHIEF, WE LET HIM
HANG HIMSELF.

- YEAH, WE KNOW.
WE GOT OFF ON THE NEXT STOP.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.451
WE MUST HAVE MISSED HIM
BY A MATTER OF SECONDS.

18:16.490 --> 18:17.684
- OF COURSE YOU DID.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.823
HE KNEW EXACTLY
HOW MUCH TIME IT WOULD TAKE.

18:19.860 --> 18:22.795
HE PROBABLY REHEARSED IT
100 TIMES.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.491

IS WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE?

18:47.050 --> 18:48.483
- AHEM, ABSOLUTELY.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.919
THIS IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST
VISIONS I'VE HAD IN YEARS.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.622

- DAMN IT, SPENCER,
I TOLD YOU TO STAY IN THE CAR.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.321
- I THINK HE'S PROBABLY KEEPING
AN EYE ON THAT DOOR.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.066

WALK THE PERIMETER.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.294
GO BACK TO THE CAR.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.558
THIS DOOR OPENS,
OR YOU SEE ANYTHING

19:33.600 --> 19:35.488

- AH, MARY.

21:30.350 --> 21:32.545
WITH A FLARE GUN?

21:32.590 --> 21:35.388

- WE HAVE THE ADDRESS.

23:46.850 --> 23:48.283
THE TIME WILL BE 9:00 PM.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.548
HE WANTS YOU ALL
TO SHOW UP THERE,

23:49.590 --> 23:51.888
WHERE HE HAS CREATED
HIS OWN MOVIE SET.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.056
- I'M DONE
WATCHING MOVIES, CHIEF.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.250
- EXACTLY, DETECTIVE.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.120
YOU NOW ARE THE MOVIE.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.390
HE'S CAST YOU ALL
AS ARCHETYPAL CHARACTERS

23:58.430 --> 23:59.966
FROM HITCHCOCK'S CANON.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.831
THERE WILL BE CLUES
THAT LEAD YOU TO CATCHING HIM,

24:01.870 --> 24:03.758
BASED ON THE PLOTS
OF THOSE FILMS.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.107
- YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?

24:05.140 --> 24:06.459
WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO PLAY DRESS-UP ALL NIGHT?

24:06.510 --> 24:09.070
- WE WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES,
DETECTIVE.

24:09.110 --> 24:11.374
HE IS GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY
TO CATCH HIM

24:11.410 --> 24:13.105
BEFORE HE KILLS AGAIN.

24:13.150 --> 24:15.812
NOW, I'M NOT SENDING YOU
IN THERE LIKE SITTING DUCKS.

24:15.850 --> 24:17.909
HE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT YOU ARE TO COME ALONE.

24:17.950 --> 24:20.384
BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS
IS GOING TO WORK

24:20.420 --> 24:21.910
IS IF I SET UP A TEAM
ON THE OUTSIDE

24:21.960 --> 24:22.915
AND COVER THE PERIMETER.

24:22.960 --> 24:23.927
- SNIPERS?

24:23.960 --> 24:25.552
- YOU BET YOUR ASS.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.729

I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.057
WHAT CAN I DO?

24:29.100 --> 24:30.795
- HE'S CALLED YOU OUT,
HENRY.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.024
YOU HAVE A HISTORY
WITH HIM AS WELL.

24:32.070 --> 24:34.231
- SEAN CONNERY?

24:34.270 --> 24:35.589
- DAD, YOU CAN SAY NO.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.766
- SHAWN, THE LAST TIME
THIS HAPPENED,

24:36.800 --> 24:37.903
YOU PUT YOUR LIFE
ON THE LINE.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.362
WE ALMOST LOST YOUR MOTHER.

24:39.410 --> 24:41.173
I'M GONNA BE
RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE, SON.

24:41.210 --> 24:42.279
END OF DISCUSSION.

24:43.180 --> 24:44.408
- ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.805
THIS ENDS TONIGHT.

24:49.450 --> 24:51.281
- ALL RIGHT, CHIEF,
NO SIGN OF HUMAN MOVEMENT.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.981
WE'RE GONNA GAIN
A BETTER VANTAGE POINT.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.817
- OKAY, PROCEED,
BUT KEEP ME POSTED

24:54.860 --> 24:56.088
AS TO YOUR COORDINATES,

24:56.120 --> 24:58.827
AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE
IS TUNED IN.

24:58.860 --> 25:01.658
SNIPERS ARE IN PLACE
AND WILL GO AT MY READY.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.497
SO NO FALSE ALARMS.

25:07.470 --> 25:09.392
I THINK THAT'S MEANT FOR ME.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.566
THAT SCENE FROM THE BIRDS--

25:10.610 --> 25:12.009
TIPPI HEDREN'S ATTACKED
IN THE CAR.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.268
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
LASSITER?

25:13.310 --> 25:14.572
DIDN'T YOU SEE MARNIE?

25:14.610 --> 25:16.976
HALF THAT MOVIE WAS ME AND TIPPI
DRIVING AROUND IN A CAR.

25:17.010 --> 25:18.500
THAT CLUE IS ALL ME.

25:18.550 --> 25:20.575
- YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE NOT
ACTUALLY SEAN CONNERY, RIGHT?

25:20.620 --> 25:21.609
- OH, I'M SORRY.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.242
NO, I GOT LOST
FOR A MOMENT THERE,

25:23.280 --> 25:25.384
BECAUSE I LITERALLY THOUGHT
I WAS TALKING TO ROD TAYLOR.

25:25.420 --> 25:27.650
- WHO'S ROD TAYLOR?
- I AM!

25:27.690 --> 25:28.782
- LOOK, STOP.
WE CAN'T BE SURE.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.412
YOU SHOULD BOTH
GO AND CHECK IT OUT.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.359
- "NEED A RIDE?"

25:48.110 --> 25:49.771
- IT'S CLEAR.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.117
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE IN THE VEHICLE.

25:56.150 --> 25:58.038
- WATCH YOURSELF.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.394
- AHEM.

26:12.430 --> 26:13.419
SORRY.

26:13.470 --> 26:16.268
LOOKS LIKE THAT'S MY CLUE.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.858
- BE CAREFUL.

- CANADA LEE?

26:21.410 --> 26:23.139
DO YOU SEE
ANY WATER AROUND HERE?

THERE WASN'T EVEN A PUDDLE.

26:24.510 --> 26:27.570

- WHAT?

26:31.920 --> 26:33.808
- MAYBE IT IS JUST A PROP.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.613
- THERE'S NO IGNITION,
NOT EVEN A PLACE FOR A KEY.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.092
- SHAWN...

26:49.140 --> 26:51.301
THIS PLACE IS CREEPY.

26:51.340 --> 26:53.365
I'M ALMOST AT THE DOOR.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.474
- OPEN IT AND THEN RUN AWAY.

- IT'S LOCKED.
YIN IN SCREWING WITH US.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.240

I CAN SEE ALL OF YOU.

27:09.090 --> 27:10.887
I CAN SEE EVERYTHING.
THE...

27:10.930 --> 27:12.682
QUESTION IS,
WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS?

27:16.530 --> 27:18.669
- THAT'S ERNIE'S BAR

THIS IS ME, SHAWN.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.335
I'LL SIGNAL EVERYONE
IF THERE'S ANYTHING.

27:23.370 --> 27:26.032
- PROCEED WITH CAUTION,

27:56.700 --> 27:58.406
THAT MUSIC IS PLAYING SO LOUD,
WE CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.135

WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

29:40.370 --> 29:42.577
THAT TUNNEL WASN'T ON
ANY OF THE SCHEMATICS,

29:42.610 --> 29:43.736
AND THE SON OF A BITCH
KNEW IT.

29:43.780 --> 29:45.077
THERE'S NO WAY
WE COULD HAVE KNOWN.

29:45.110 --> 29:48.409
- UNLESS YOU'RE A PSYCHIC.

29:48.450 --> 29:49.678
- SHAWN...

29:49.720 --> 29:50.846
I JUST SPOKE
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.517
I WANTED HER TO KNOW
THAT YOU WERE SAFE.

29:52.550 --> 29:53.744
SHE'S FINE.

29:53.790 --> 29:56.258
SHE'S AT A HOTEL IN NEW YORK
AT A CONFERENCE.

29:56.290 --> 29:58.429
I TOLD HER TO STAY PUT.

29:58.460 --> 29:59.927
- SHAWN...

29:59.960 --> 30:01.598
DOESN'T ABIGAIL
GET IN TONIGHT?

30:04.170 --> 30:05.421
- OH, MY GOD.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.358
WHAT TIME IS IT?

30:07.400 --> 30:08.958
- IT'S ALMOST 1:00.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.592
- HER FLIGHT GETS IN
IN HALF AN HOUR.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.938
- WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LET YOU GO.

30:12.970 --> 30:14.369
SHAWN, WHAT HAPPENS
IF A CALL COMES IN

30:14.410 --> 30:16.071
AND WE NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE
HALFWAY ACROSS THE CITY

30:16.110 --> 30:17.839
IN 11 MINUTES?
- I HAVE TO PICK HER UP.

30:17.880 --> 30:18.904
- DON'T WORRY.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.168
WE'LL SEND SOMEONE TO GET HER.
SOMEONE SHE KNOWS.

30:24.350 --> 30:25.749
MCNAB!

30:28.360 --> 30:29.679
- HOW WAS UGANDA?

30:29.720 --> 30:31.620
- IT WAS RICH, COMPELLING,
A MUST-SEE.

30:31.660 --> 30:32.820
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT, BUZZ?

30:32.860 --> 30:34.122
- CAN'T REALLY SAY.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.650
I'M JUST HERE TO MAKE SURE
YOU GET HOME SAFELY.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.258
- WHY WOULDN'T I BE SAFE?

30:37.300 --> 30:39.222
THIS IS RIDICULOUS,
AND I AM BEYOND JETLAGGED.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.738
JUST TELL ME
WHAT IS GOING ON.

30:41.770 --> 30:43.465
- PLEASE, MS. LYTAR.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.263
JUST FOLLOWING MY ORDERS.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.938

30:58.390 --> 31:00.381

31:06.560 --> 31:09.529

31:13.070 --> 31:14.765
[cell phone ringing]

31:14.800 --> 31:16.131
- IT'S ABIGAIL.

31:16.170 --> 31:18.229
HEY, ABS, SORRY I COULDN'T
PICK YOU UP MYSELF.

31:18.270 --> 31:19.339

31:19.370 --> 31:22.032
I HAVE GOOD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.069
[turns on speaker phone]
THE GOOD NEWS IS

31:23.110 --> 31:24.748
THAT OUR FEMME FATALE

31:24.780 --> 31:26.202
IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.115
THE BAD NEWS,
FOR YOU ANYWAY,

31:28.150 --> 31:31.187
IS THAT I HAVE NOW MET
THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.778
I UNDERSTAND YOUR PREDICAMENT.

31:32.820 --> 31:35.254
THEY'RE BOTH SO YOU.

31:35.290 --> 31:37.952
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE
OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO.

31:37.990 --> 31:40.129
SO I'M DOING YOU
A FAVOR HERE

31:40.160 --> 31:42.299
BY FORCING YOU TO CHOOSE.

31:42.330 --> 31:43.251
- CHOOSE?

31:43.300 --> 31:44.597
- YES, SHAWN.

31:44.630 --> 31:46.598
WHO DO YOU
CARE ABOUT MORE?

31:46.630 --> 31:49.497
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
SAVE THEM BOTH.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.078
- MCNAB IS OKAY.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.953
HE DIDN'T GET A LOOK
AT YIN.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.555
YOU WANT SOMETHING
FROM THE SNACK MACHINE?

32:12.590 --> 32:14.797
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE BUGLES.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.561
[cell phone ringing]

32:22.600 --> 32:26.161
THIS IS IT!
THIS IS IT!

32:29.340 --> 32:32.207
WHAT IS THE CLUE?
WHAT'S THE CLUE!

32:32.250 --> 32:35.742
- SHAWN, I'LL DROP BY
HALF PAST 4:00.

32:35.780 --> 32:38.089
MY HANDS ARE ON MY FACE.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.486
PLEASE COME QUICK,
OR THIS COULD BE MESSY.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.555
SHAWN, YOU CAN STILL
SAVE ABIGAI--

32:41.590 --> 32:43.581
[dial tone]

32:58.970 --> 33:00.733
- "HANDS ON MY FACE."
IT'S A CLOCK.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.874
- HALF PAST FOUR,
THIS COULD GET MESSY.

33:02.910 --> 33:04.309
- "I'LL DROP BY."

33:04.350 --> 33:06.306
- SHE'S KIM NOVAK
IN VERTIGO.

33:06.350 --> 33:08.671
- "I'LL...DROP BY."

33:08.720 --> 33:10.608
- INSTEAD OF A BELL TOWER...
- IT'S A CLOCK TOWER.

33:10.650 --> 33:12.015
IT'S THE CLOCK TOWER!

33:12.050 --> 33:13.119
- DETECTIVE, WAIT.

33:13.150 --> 33:14.959
A CIVILIAN HAS BEEN
TAKEN AS WELL.

33:14.990 --> 33:16.412
SHE MUST BE GIVEN PRIORITY.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.779
IF WE HAD
THE SLIGHTEST CLUE--

33:17.820 --> 33:19.082
- YOU'VE GOT
OTHER UNITS, CHIEF.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.984
I'LL BE GOING
TO GET MY PARTNER NOW.

33:21.030 --> 33:22.395
- DETECTIVE!

33:22.430 --> 33:23.658
MR. SPENCER,

33:23.700 --> 33:25.998
CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE ABIGAIL IS?

33:29.340 --> 33:31.365
- I CAN'T.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.469
THERE'S NO WAY
TO SAVE THEM BOTH.

33:35.710 --> 33:36.904
[sniffles]

33:37.780 --> 33:39.145
IT'S JULES.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.579
WE KNOW WHERE SHE IS,
WE FOLLOW LASSIE.

33:40.610 --> 33:42.919
WE SAVE JULIET.

33:42.950 --> 33:45.089
- OKAY.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.815
I'LL DRIVE.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.488
HENRY, GO HOME.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.748
YOUR ROLE HERE IS FINISHED.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.155
- NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.

33:51.190 --> 33:52.726
- YOU, TOO, ARE A CIVILIAN,

33:52.760 --> 33:54.921
AND THEREFORE
AN UNNECESSARY RISK.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.622
- ALL RIGHT, I ACCEPT.
- EXCUSE ME?

33:57.660 --> 33:59.218
- THE JOB--THE JOB
YOU OFFERED ME, KAREN.

33:59.270 --> 34:00.294
I ACCEPT.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.389
CUT ME A LITTLE SLACK
ON THE WARDROBE.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.431
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.700
- GUS, WAIT.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.270

34:12.310 --> 34:14.449
YANG DIDN'T DRAW HERSELF.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.210
SHE DREW ABIGAIL...
ON THE PIER.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.808
I THINK I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
- LET'S GO GET HER.

34:18.850 --> 34:20.112
- NO, NO, NO.
I COULD BE WRONG.

34:20.150 --> 34:21.754
YOU GO WITH THE CHIEF.
YOU HELP LASSIE.

34:21.790 --> 34:23.052
- SHAWN, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ALONE.

34:23.090 --> 34:24.819
- GUS, THE ONLY WAY THAT
I CAN NOT BE THERE FOR JULIET

34:24.860 --> 34:26.452
IS IF I KNOW THAT YOU ARE.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.151
AND I WON'T BE ALONE.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.128
BOATS.

34:38.170 --> 34:39.706
- ALL RIGHT,
DON'T WORRY, SON.

34:39.740 --> 34:41.378
IF SHE'S HERE,
WE'LL FIND HER.

34:58.190 --> 35:00.556

ISN'T SHE?
