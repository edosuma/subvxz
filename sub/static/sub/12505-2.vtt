00:05.706 --> 00:06.774
[Payson] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:06.807 --> 00:09.210
I would like to be petitioned
onto the National Team.

00:09.243 --> 00:12.046
[Sasha] Payson,
you're not ready.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.581
- You'll only get one shot.
- I'll be ready.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.584
Do you really think Ellen Beals
wants to hurt the girls?

00:16.617 --> 00:17.585
I think she wants
to control them.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.320
OK. I want Sasha Belov out.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.289
- Of The Rock?
- Of the sport.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.490
You don't love me anymore?

00:22.523 --> 00:23.824
I think we're better as friends.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.593
Is there something
you're not telling me?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.328
There's something
you didn't get.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.063
You didn't get Carter.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.164
I did.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.465
[Damon]
This is for you, Emily.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.067
Guess you really are
letting me go.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.603
He's gonna think I didn't
care enough to say goodbye.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.072
Damon's in Europe.
Maybe you'll get to see him.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.140
[Emily] I'm going to France
to compete.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.076
And only to compete.

00:48.649 --> 00:52.253
[speaks French]

00:52.286 --> 00:54.322
Sweetie, the only French I know

00:54.355 --> 00:57.358
I picked up from
a talking candlestick
in Beauty And The Beast.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.792
English, please.

00:58.826 --> 01:02.630
I was saying, "I'm not going
all the way to France
to be an alternate!"

01:02.663 --> 01:07.201
Yes. You are. And you will kiss
Ellen Beals'... derriere,

01:07.235 --> 01:09.137
to let her know
how grateful you are.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.338
How's that for French?

01:10.371 --> 01:12.106
[Chloe]
Let me get this straight.

01:12.140 --> 01:15.176
If Paris is like Denver...

01:15.209 --> 01:17.511
Oh, wow. I cannot wait
to see where this is going.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.581
- And Calais is like Boulder...
- Not remotely, but OK.

01:20.614 --> 01:24.452
- And even though Damon's gonna
be performing in Denver...
- Paris.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.155
- And you're going
to be competing in Boulder...
- Calais.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.522
You're still not gonna
try to see him?

01:28.556 --> 01:30.458
Mom, Ellen Beals
went out on a limb

01:30.491 --> 01:32.360
to get me a sponsorship.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.395
I'm not gonna
risk losing it.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.164
I know. You're right.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.699
But, it's Paris.
How romantic would that be?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.170
Hi, Mr. Tanner.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.305
Hey, Kaylie.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.141
Uh, is there something
going on with you two?

01:47.175 --> 01:49.677
[scoffs] She gets
one stupid magazine cover

01:49.710 --> 01:52.180
and thinks she doesn't need
her old friends anymore.

01:52.213 --> 01:55.249
Yeah, well, friends can be
overrated. And time consuming.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.552
It wouldn't hurt you
to focus a little more
on your gymnastics anyway.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.520
What's that supposed to mean?

01:59.553 --> 02:02.423
It means Kaylie's number
one in the country.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.459
You can't even beat Emily
for number two here at The Rock.

02:05.493 --> 02:10.164
Hey, Bob... can I get your input
on something? You got a minute?

02:10.198 --> 02:13.234
Alternate or Olympic contender?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.703
It's up to you, Lauren.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.172
* She's walking with death

02:18.206 --> 02:21.442
I know it's eight hours later
in France, but call me.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.577
As soon as you know anything.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.313
I don't care what time it is.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.514
OK, I will.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.716
We all want the same thing
for our kids,

02:28.749 --> 02:32.320
the opportunity to win
an Olympic medal. Am I right?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.722
- It's the only
reason we're here.
- I've got some ideas.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.457
But this isn't
the time or place.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.692
I'm having a little
get-together.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.229
We can nosh...
watch the girls on TV....

02:54.508 --> 02:59.213
[sighs] Look. I'm sorry I
told you about Carter that way.

02:59.247 --> 03:02.616
I was upset. I know you're
mad, but I really hope we can...

03:02.650 --> 03:05.619
I'm not mad. I'm relieved.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.756
I can finally focus
on what's really important,

03:08.789 --> 03:12.393
winning the all-around
Olympic Gold Medal in 2012.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.397
You should know,
we're having sex.

03:18.266 --> 03:22.736
Great. Maybe now you'll
get a magazine cover.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.105
I heard about
the viewing party.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.974
Just wanted you
to know we'll be there.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.810
Perfect, but keep it on
the down low. It's just
for the A-listers.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.516
- You're having a party?
- It's more... business.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.018
- Well, did I
make the A-list?
- Of course.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.987
Emily's the number two girl
at the gym.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.390
You're more like
an A-plus.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.392
[both laugh]

03:44.425 --> 03:49.029
Em, sit with me.
Number one and two
have to stick together.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.599
[phone beeping]

03:51.632 --> 03:54.768
Oh, my gosh! Green Day
is going to be in Paris!

03:54.802 --> 03:56.737
Damon's gonna be less
than an hour from Calais!

03:56.770 --> 03:58.606
- Emily are you
going to see him?!
- No.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.275
Emily understands that boys
are a distraction

04:01.309 --> 04:03.677
if you want to stay
focused on gymnastics.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.813
Right, Em?

04:05.846 --> 04:09.450
I think Emily understands
you can have gold medals
and true love.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.556
Itineraries and contacts
for the girls.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.425
Oh, thank you.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.428
You know, I'm so happy that
you're back at The Rock.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.830
You know, I really missed it.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.666
Oh, I was thinking I might
throw a viewing party

04:25.699 --> 04:28.402
for the girls at my house,
to watch them on TV.

04:28.436 --> 04:31.305
- What do you think?
- Can't. Sorry. Working.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.840
- Sorry.
- You?

04:32.873 --> 04:36.810
Uh... No.
Me, too. Sorry.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.679
OK.

04:40.113 --> 04:44.318
Payson? Are you certain
you want to do this?

04:44.352 --> 04:46.086
The committee will
only give you one shot.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.722
- I'll work with you.
In a couple months...
- I'm ready now.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.561
[sighs]

04:53.594 --> 04:55.696
Kaylie thinks just because
we have boyfriends,

04:55.729 --> 04:57.365
we can't be as good as her.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.732
But we'll prove
her wrong, right?

04:58.766 --> 05:00.534
We girls with boyfriends
need to stick together.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.337
Since when do you
have a boyfriend?

05:03.371 --> 05:07.375
You mean Kaylie didn't tell you
Carter and I are together now?

05:07.408 --> 05:09.543
- What? When did this happen...?
- [Kaylie] Can we drop it?

05:09.577 --> 05:12.112
I'm going to France
as the number one gymnast
in the country

05:12.145 --> 05:14.348
and that is better
than any boyfriend.

05:14.382 --> 05:18.352
Now, can we stay focused
on what we need to do?

05:18.386 --> 05:20.621
Unless, of course,
you're an alternate,

05:20.654 --> 05:23.491
in which case, you won't
be doing much of anything.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.507
[chatter]

05:39.540 --> 05:42.676
I can't believe it.
We're really in France.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.779
Oui. Tres fantastique.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.382
- That means...
- We all know what that means.

05:48.416 --> 05:51.419
Loose translation: "I'm
a pretentious show-off."

05:51.452 --> 05:54.622
Kaylie, may I have
your autograph?

05:54.655 --> 05:55.923
Yeah, sure.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.727
Must be tough.
It used to be you, right?

06:01.595 --> 06:05.399
Do you want my autograph?
I'm on the US National team.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.835
No. Merci.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.438
They're French.
They can be so rude.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.441
Austin Tucker?

06:13.474 --> 06:17.445
Didn't he say he won Worlds with
the worst hangover of his life?

06:17.478 --> 06:19.680
No. I'm pretty sure that
was his Olympic gold medal.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.949
Does it even matter? He treats
gymnastics like a joke.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.685
All he cares about
is partying and hanging
out with celebrities.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.154
* ...over till it's over

06:27.187 --> 06:28.756
You've got to be kidding me.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.158
[girls screaming]

06:31.191 --> 06:34.695
Wow, we are staying in the same
hotel as Austin Tucker.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.431
- We should say hi.
- You know him?

06:37.465 --> 06:41.435
We're on the National Team.
I think he knows who we are.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.774
Hi, Austin? Hi...

06:46.807 --> 06:49.843
Um... We haven't met, but...

06:49.877 --> 06:52.780
- Where do you want me to sign?
- [snickering]

06:52.813 --> 06:56.584
- How about right here?
- Oh, no. I'm not a fan.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.519
Ouch.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.589
Maybe we can
do something about that.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.958
See, I've got this thing
tonight. Maybe you want
to come along?

07:04.992 --> 07:09.463
- [girls laughing]
- No... Well, I just...

07:09.497 --> 07:10.831
I have plans.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.469
[all snickering]

07:15.503 --> 07:18.772
- That was priceless.
- Wow! Wow!

07:43.797 --> 07:46.534
There you are. Welcome, girls.
Good flight, I hope.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.836
- [all] Yes, Ms. Beals.
- [Ellen] Good.
I've already checked you in.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.605
Why don't you go up to your
rooms and try to get some sleep?

07:51.639 --> 07:53.807
We slept on the plane.
We thought we'd do
a little sight-seeing.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.644
Absolutely not.
You will not leave your rooms.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.713
Let's not forget
why we're here: To compete.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.583
To represent our country.
Kaylie, as team captain,

08:02.616 --> 08:05.285
I'm counting on you
to make sure everyone
follows the rules.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.055
Sleep well. I expect to see
you all looking sharp at
practice in the morning.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.524
Shouldn't we check in
with Marty?

08:10.558 --> 08:12.292
Oh, you didn't hear?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.795
Marty's on a leave of absence.
Pending committee review.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.665
Oh, so who's gonna be our....?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.668
I'll be supervising your
very capable assistant coaches,

08:20.701 --> 08:22.703
allowing me a chance to get
to know you all so much better.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.945
[deep sigh] Aren't we all glad
we're on her good side now?

08:31.979 --> 08:34.548
You're welcome.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.617
[Kim] I'm starting
to get a complex.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.620
I've asked a dozen parents
to come to my house on Sunday

08:39.653 --> 08:41.689
and watch the meet
and all of them are busy.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.825
- All of them.
- Well, you didn't ask me.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.095
Well, um, Summer, would you
like to come to my house

08:48.128 --> 08:50.964
- on Sunday and watch the meet?
- Sorry. I have plans.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.100
- [laughing]
- Seriously.
Sasha's working Sunday.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.336
I have to be here.
Why don't you watch with us?

08:56.369 --> 08:57.905
Maybe I will.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.974
I have to admit, it's
so good to be working again.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.710
It makes me feel connected.

09:02.743 --> 09:06.113
You know, you could be even
more connected, if you wanted.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.782
The Parents Board. They're
electing a new president.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.018
No. It's way
too political for me.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.986
Besides, isn't Alex
running again?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.889
Actually, no.
And you'd be great.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.791
You're sweet,
but the answer's still no.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.360
I'd like to keep
these parents as my friends.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.962
- Bye.
- See ya.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.669
I still can't believe
that jerk acted like
he didn't know me... us.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.706
Austin Tucker... undercover.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.975
I'm pretty sure
he wasn't acting.

09:35.008 --> 09:39.379
[groans] I still can't believe
we're stuck in this hotel.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.049
No, it's good. Like Beals said,
we need to stay focused.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.618
And we only have
one day to practice.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.987
Fine. But I don't need
to be locked up to focus.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.657
If I was at home
I'd be working,

09:49.690 --> 09:51.391
or hanging with Brian,
or something.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.927
[groans] I feel like I'm going
to hyperventilate.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.696
[Lauren] Ooh!
We could all go to Paris.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.230
There's trains leaving
every hour.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.968
You do know that Ellen Beals
is gonna be coming around
for a bed check, right?

10:01.001 --> 10:02.703
She's gonna be watching
our every move.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.773
I don't mean now.
We can go tomorrow night.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.875
We could all go see
Damon and Green Day.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.943
And Emily, you'd love Paris.

10:09.977 --> 10:13.046
The night before a competition?
Are you crazy?

10:13.080 --> 10:14.715
We wouldn't have
to stay out late.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.650
So go. You're an alternate.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.386
- You won't be missed.
- Enough, OK? No more sniping.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.389
Does France have something
against cold beverages?

10:22.422 --> 10:26.159
- I'll get ice.
- Thanks.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.662
Do you think Damon's gonna be
mad you didn't come to see him?

10:28.696 --> 10:30.197
He doesn't even know
I'm here.

10:30.230 --> 10:34.768
Well, I guess there's really
no point in seeing him.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.771
With all his fans
and groupies...

10:37.805 --> 10:40.974
- I'm sure he's moved on.
- [sighs]

10:41.008 --> 10:43.777
- [door closes]
- [Austin] Party's gonna
be great.

10:45.713 --> 10:46.914
[laughs]

10:48.882 --> 10:51.018
Hey, don't I know you?

10:51.885 --> 10:52.886
[sighs]

10:54.254 --> 10:56.123
No.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.227
No, I think we have
very clearly established

11:00.260 --> 11:02.930
that you do not know me.

11:02.963 --> 11:06.233
I knew it. We met
in front of the hotel.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.737
Where we also established that
you are not a fan of mine.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.438
But, we didn't establish why.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.975
Seriously? Did you hit
your head on a dismount?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.177
A lot, actually.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.746
Why? What am I missing?

11:19.847 --> 11:23.116
I'm Kaylie Cruz!
The Women's National Champion.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.985
That's it! You're
one of the Rock Rebels!

11:25.018 --> 11:26.453
[laughs]

11:26.486 --> 11:29.489
- So you do know us.
- Know you? I love you!

11:29.522 --> 11:31.291
That thing against China?
Very cool.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.730
Oh, well...
[clears throat] Thank you.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.767
Let me make it up to you.
Come to a party with us?

11:40.901 --> 11:43.971
Party? Your coach doesn't
care if you go out?

11:44.004 --> 11:47.875
The better question
is... do I? And I don't.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.910
Rules are for people
with no self-discipline.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.147
Well, I can't. I'm...

11:54.181 --> 11:56.817
- I'm busy.
- [Austin] Of course you are.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.187
That's why
I don't date gymnasts.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.532
[Ellen] Tomorrow,
you'll share this venue

12:12.565 --> 12:15.168
with teams from France,
Germany and Romania.

12:15.202 --> 12:19.106
But for the next 90 minutes,
it's all yours.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.843
So use your practice time
wisely.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.779
[Kaylie] If it's all ours,
what is he doing here?

12:25.813 --> 12:27.280
[Lauren] Distracted much?

12:27.314 --> 12:28.548
No.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.518
OK, let's go, people!
Tick-tock.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.120
* Before they push you out

12:33.153 --> 12:34.922
* I guess it's automatic

12:34.955 --> 12:36.790
* It's definitely dramatic

12:36.824 --> 12:38.291
* Do you really love it?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.326
* Do you really love?

12:39.359 --> 12:41.528
* Do you really love it?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.530
* Do you really love?

12:43.563 --> 12:44.998
* Do you really love it?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.533
* Do you really love

12:46.566 --> 12:48.001
Good. Very good, Lauren.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.537
And I never miss it.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.638
You know, I was thinking.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.541
Maybe one of the other girls
can go as an alternate...

12:54.574 --> 12:56.076
It's too late for that, Lauren.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.811
You only compete
if someone gets hurt.

12:57.845 --> 13:01.915
- Or breaks the rules.
- I suppose there is that.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.353
* And all encircled
for 80s melody *

13:06.386 --> 13:08.088
* New shoes all a-glowin'

13:08.121 --> 13:09.356
* Onto the catwalk

13:09.389 --> 13:11.825
* But tell me all about it

13:11.859 --> 13:14.962
If you lose a few pounds,
that'll be easier for you,
Kaylie.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.564
* Do you really love?
Do you really love it? *

13:17.597 --> 13:19.833
- Got it.
- * Do you really love?

13:19.867 --> 13:21.869
* Do you really love it?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.837
* Do you really love?
Do you really love it? *

13:23.871 --> 13:26.373
[Ellen] Payson, I haven't
seen your double pike yet.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.942
- It's not compulsory.
- I'm afraid it is.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.577
They added it.
Is that gonna be a problem?

13:30.610 --> 13:33.847
No. No problem. I can do it.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.015
Good.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.017
Watch your hand positions.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.022
[phone beeping]

13:42.055 --> 13:45.825
[exhales] Check this out.
I pulled it off the Internet.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.896
Damon and some girl.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.865
Probably just a fan.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.267
It must be like that
every place he goes...

13:54.301 --> 13:58.338
Girls just throwing
themselves at him and...

13:58.371 --> 13:59.406
I wouldn't know.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.640
* Fingertips are fumbling...

14:00.673 --> 14:04.244
Guess you can't really blame
him if he hooks up with anyone.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.280
It's not like he
ever heard from you.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.349
As far as he knows,
you just blew him off.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.051
* Do you really love it?

14:11.084 --> 14:14.354
- [tape ripping]
- It's OK.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.023
* Do you really love?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.891
* Do you really love it?

14:17.925 --> 14:20.127
* Do you really love?

14:20.160 --> 14:24.464
[panting] I'm sorry.
I'll try that again.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.935
No do-overs tomorrow, Emily.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.302
We need your focus here.

14:29.336 --> 14:32.639
Whatever's distracting you...
deal with it.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.474
We need you at your
very best tomorrow.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.945
OK?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.653
[Lauren] What do you want?

14:46.686 --> 14:48.221
[Emily] Uh, Subway Club.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.457
I need lean meat and complex
carbs for tomorrow.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.459
You think that will help
your layout lay out?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.962
Veggie Delite on whole wheat.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.965
My last five.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.368
- Where is Payson?
- She's still practicing
her double pike.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.938
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Nastia.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.074
- Hey, Champ.
Nice work in Boston.
- Thanks.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.675
Just trying to follow
in your footsteps.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.477
Tell Payson I said hello.
I heard she's petitioning.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.180
Yeah. She looks
really great, too.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.482
- It'll be good
to have her back.
- Yeah.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.951
Well, stay focused and
keep eating right. Work hard.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.286
That's how I won
my gold medal.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.422
- [both] Thanks.
- Bye.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.491
Wow! Nastia Luikin.

15:24.524 --> 15:28.028
- She's so cool!
- Yeah, she's a great girl.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.232
She won the gold medal.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.467
Because she works harder
than anyone I know.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.736
True. What about Lindsey Vonn?

15:36.769 --> 15:39.372
She doesn't just have a
boyfriend, she has a husband.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.108
And a gold medal.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.742
Did it ever occur to you
that the love and support

15:42.775 --> 15:44.744
from a boyfriend might
actually make you better?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.247
- No.
- Well, I know I wouldn't
have survived Nationals

15:47.280 --> 15:49.983
if it weren't for Damon.
He brought Brian,

15:50.017 --> 15:51.985
and walked me
through my freak out.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.988
Having him there...

15:55.022 --> 15:56.389
He's the reason
I made the National Team.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.491
You don't seriously
believe that?

15:58.525 --> 16:00.994
Not only that,
he wrote a song for you.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.529
He dedicated it
to you on the radio.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.232
And you never even said goodbye.
No wonder you're distracted.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.101
Emily is choosing to focus
on what matters most:

16:08.135 --> 16:10.037
her gymnastics.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.005
Why can't I choose both?

16:12.039 --> 16:15.142
I could leave for Paris this
afternoon and be back by curfew.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.778
All I would do here is go crazy
in my hotel room for 15 hours.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.381
As Team Captain, I can't even
let you consider that.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.184
As Team Captain, you
have to help bring out
the best in everyone.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.019
Emily needs closure with Damon.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.021
It's no different than you
cutting off Carter at Nationals.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.389
You said it yourself.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.192
Saying goodbye to Carter
is practically how you won.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.994
[groans]

16:35.528 --> 16:37.230
You're going to say goodbye?

16:39.066 --> 16:40.400
And you think this will help?

16:42.069 --> 16:43.436
Duh.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.541
- To Paris.
And from Paris.
- Merci.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.477
[speaks French]

16:57.150 --> 16:59.452
[concierge speaking French]

17:05.158 --> 17:06.826
One round-trip ticket.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.462
- Is Emily still upstairs,
getting ready?
- Yeah.

17:09.496 --> 17:13.200
Well, tell your new BFF not to
miss the 7:00 train from Paris.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.202
That should give her plenty
of time for curfew.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.170
Why are you being nice?

17:17.204 --> 17:19.139
Because I believe in love.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.309
Whatever.
I'm still not sure...

17:22.342 --> 17:25.078
Stop. You need Emily
to bring her "A" game.

17:25.112 --> 17:28.348
We both know how inconsistent
she can get when
she's distracted.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.250
And this will focus her.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.156
[acoustic music playing]

17:36.189 --> 17:38.858
* All alone

17:38.891 --> 17:41.261
* We'll make a place

17:41.294 --> 17:44.364
* Where we can die together

17:44.397 --> 17:48.135
* Where the miles between us

17:48.168 --> 17:51.171
* They fall apart

17:51.204 --> 17:54.241
* No matter what you're doing

17:54.274 --> 17:57.110
* No matter where we are

17:57.144 --> 18:00.880
* We can see the same
stars in the sky *

18:00.913 --> 18:04.117
* And never be

18:04.151 --> 18:06.419
* Apart *

18:10.157 --> 18:12.559
[Emily clapping] Whoo!

18:29.342 --> 18:31.110
I must be dreaming.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.547
- You sounded...
- Shh!

18:37.684 --> 18:39.286
God, I don't want to wake up.

18:52.565 --> 18:56.403
[Chloe] So, why are you suddenly
becoming more social?

18:56.436 --> 19:01.708
Because I've decided to run for
President of the Parents Board.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.944
That means I need the support
of parents with influence.

19:04.977 --> 19:10.217
Parents, like you and me, who
have genuine Olympic contenders.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.452
I thought maybe it was for us.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.288
To get more involved
in the community together.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.923
About that.

19:16.956 --> 19:20.727
I think we should downplay
the "us." For now.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.729
If people know we're together,

19:22.762 --> 19:25.332
they'll spend so much time
talking about us,

19:25.365 --> 19:27.534
they won't listen to us.

19:27.567 --> 19:32.272
Let's keep this special...
between us.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.941
You're an insider now.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.344
Playing the politics
comes with the territory.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.280
If we have a secret alliance,

19:40.313 --> 19:43.216
we'll get everything our way
and no one's the wiser.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.751
A secret alliance.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.519
Of insiders.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.956
I like it.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.758
[chatter]

19:57.530 --> 19:59.232
[Emily] I'm so proud of you.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.435
You did exactly what
you said you would do.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.238
And you did it your way.
Without selling out.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.407
And look at you,

20:07.440 --> 20:11.244
competing in France,
ranked third.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.646
Where have you been?
Why haven't I heard from you?

20:13.680 --> 20:18.551
I tried. I mean,
I got your note late.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.488
When I heard you on the radio,
I ran to the studio

20:21.521 --> 20:23.723
to say goodbye,
but you were already gone.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.296
OK... And after that?

20:29.329 --> 20:31.264
I called. I did.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.532
Your cell doesn't work
in Europe.

20:32.565 --> 20:37.804
And after that, I started about
1,000 e-mails that I never sent.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.472
Why not?

20:39.506 --> 20:42.241
It just felt lame to say
goodbye in an e-mail.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.514
And then I realized that...

20:49.782 --> 20:51.351
...I just didn't
want to say goodbye.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.787
- Then don't.
- Come on, Damon.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.589
We have to say goodbye.
You know that.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.590
That's why we're here.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.426
- No...
- Look...

20:59.459 --> 21:02.295
I have to be completely
committed to my
training schedule

21:02.329 --> 21:03.463
until the 2012 Olympics.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.365
Yeah, well, I don't.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.335
I can be there for you,
I can support you.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.542
Part of this whole dream
coming true for you is
the whole experience, you know?

21:15.575 --> 21:18.044
I want you to have that.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.347
I want you to have it all.

21:20.380 --> 21:24.317
I can't let you stay holed up
for two years waiting for me.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.385
That is not fair.

21:25.418 --> 21:28.621
For you to really
have your dream,

21:28.655 --> 21:30.890
and for me to really
have my dream...

21:32.892 --> 21:34.761
...we have to say goodbye.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.767
Say it.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.303
Say it first.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.443
Come on, for me.
I can't do it.

21:59.786 --> 22:03.322
Goodbye... Emily Kmetko.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.659
[sighs]

22:07.694 --> 22:09.562
Goodbye, Damon Young.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.156
Hey, how did it go?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.525
Did you nail the double pike?

22:38.558 --> 22:39.792
Yeah.

22:39.826 --> 22:42.729
So that's good.
You're ready for tomorrow.

22:44.831 --> 22:45.965
Where's Emily?

22:48.435 --> 22:49.536
What?

22:49.569 --> 22:51.137
It's romantic and
has great pastries

22:51.170 --> 22:52.672
and it rhymes with Ferris.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.941
No she didn't! She did not
go see Damon in Paris?!

22:54.974 --> 22:57.143
- She had to.
- Had to?

22:57.176 --> 22:59.779
To say goodbye.
To get him out of her head.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.848
She doesn't have
our focus, Payson.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.651
We were just trying to make
the best of a bad situation.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.553
A bad situation?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.555
That's what you're gonna
call this? What kind
of leader are you?

23:08.588 --> 23:10.189
How could you let her do this?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.257
What if her train is late?

23:11.290 --> 23:13.826
Or Ellen Beals catches her?
She could get suspended!

23:15.194 --> 23:17.530
Let's just pray that
doesn't happen.

23:19.198 --> 23:23.970
- One way.
- No, no. Round trip. Calais.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.205
No, mademoiselle. One way.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.907
You must buy a ticket
for Calais.

23:27.940 --> 23:31.511
But I don't have
any money. Please?

23:31.544 --> 23:33.613
[speaks French]

23:43.890 --> 23:46.759
Come on, Emily. Where are you?

23:46.793 --> 23:48.761
This is ridiculous.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.863
I'm going to my room and
I'm going to sleep.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.766
I don't know about
the rest of you, but I have
a really big day tomorrow.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.869
This is why you don't run around
the night before a meet.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.705
[Lauren] It's not
Kaylie's fault.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.841
It's Emily's. We planned it so
she'd be back in plenty of time.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.643
She probably stayed
too long with Damon.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.911
Would everyone just chill?

24:04.944 --> 24:06.479
She'll be here.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.881
- [knocking on door]
- Who is it?

24:08.915 --> 24:10.550
[Ellen] Ellen Beals.
May I come in?

24:10.583 --> 24:12.985
Just a minute!
We have to cover for Emily.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.588
We? I didn't tell her to go.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.898
Shouldn't you two
be in your own room?

24:25.932 --> 24:27.900
- We were just leaving. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.802
Everything OK here, Lauren?

24:29.836 --> 24:31.638
Oh yes, Ms. Beals.

24:31.671 --> 24:34.941
Emily's in the shower.
She says it relaxes her.

24:34.974 --> 24:38.077
Oh, that's all right.
I'll check back later.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.682
[music playing]

24:46.886 --> 24:48.755
[crowd cheers and applauds]

24:55.962 --> 24:57.864
- [woman] Awesome.
- [excited chatter]

25:02.301 --> 25:03.636
[sighs]

25:03.670 --> 25:08.675
Merci. Merci. Merci.

25:08.708 --> 25:11.310
Hey, aren't you one
of the Rock Rebels?

25:11.343 --> 25:14.046
Um... Yeah. Emily.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.584
Thought so. Any idea where
the train to Calais boards?

25:17.617 --> 25:19.986
- Over there.
- Cool, thanks.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.089
Wait! Please don't leave.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.058
Um... I need money for a ticket.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.827
I'll pay you back. I promise.

25:27.860 --> 25:32.699
Sorry, but my mom taught me,
"Neither a borrower nor
a lender be."

25:32.732 --> 25:34.834
Oh, what the hell?

25:38.871 --> 25:42.975
One Euro? No,
you don't understand.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.844
I need to get to Calais now.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.713
I'm late. And in
really big trouble.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.348
Sorry, but a flip and a tuck
is worth a Euro.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.652
Now a full twist...
That could get you a ticket.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.788
OK. Fine.

26:04.631 --> 26:05.898
[applause]

26:11.403 --> 26:13.372
One ticket to Calais.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.974
Thank you.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.943
So what are you
doing in Paris?

26:16.976 --> 26:19.646
- Green Day concert.
- Really?

26:19.679 --> 26:21.013
Did you see the opening act?

26:21.047 --> 26:23.750
Damon Young?
Yeah, he was awesome.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.885
I know him. He's my...

26:25.918 --> 26:27.954
- Was...
- You know him?

26:27.987 --> 26:29.722
Is he always that intense?
He could not stop talking

26:29.756 --> 26:32.792
or singing about
some chick Emily...

26:32.825 --> 26:35.027
Emily. You're Emily.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.665
He was upset?

26:38.698 --> 26:42.034
A bit of a train wreck.
The girls went nuts for it.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.636
So what did you do to him?

26:43.670 --> 26:45.972
Come on, you know as well as
I do that we can't win gold

26:46.005 --> 26:49.041
unless we're totally dedicated.
We have to give it 100 percent.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.811
I don't know that at all.
Loving life, living large...

26:51.844 --> 26:53.813
All that makes
my gymnastics better.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.782
I did the right thing,
saying goodbye to Damon.

26:55.815 --> 26:59.018
Gymnastics is my priority.
It's my life.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.920
You gotta go with your gut.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.690
So, that means you're single,
right?

27:03.723 --> 27:05.191
[woman on PA speaks French]

27:15.735 --> 27:18.771
Thanks again. I swear
I'll pay you back.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.108
I'll take a hug as collateral.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.114
[elevator dings]

27:29.849 --> 27:32.685
Hello, Emily. Austin.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.888
Two of you having a nice night?

27:43.129 --> 27:44.931
[Kaylie] You're ready
for this, Pay.

27:44.964 --> 27:48.034
You've done the work.
You're strong. You're focused.

27:48.067 --> 27:51.003
Now, just go out there
and let it rip.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.139
Thanks, Kaylie.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.480
I just wanted
to say good luck.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.984
There's no way the Committee can
keep you off the National Team.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.252
You're gonna do great.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.492
Payson, the Committee
is ready to see you now.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.261
And Kaylie, as team captain,
you should know,

28:15.294 --> 28:17.930
Lauren will be taking
Emily's place today.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.941
Whenever you're ready, Payson.

29:44.316 --> 29:47.053
These next two years
are do-or-die.

29:47.086 --> 29:50.122
We need someone running
that board who's dedicated

29:50.156 --> 29:53.926
to making sure everything,
and that includes our coach,

29:53.960 --> 29:58.230
favors our girls' chances
of being on that Olympic Team.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.399
Excuse me one sec.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.836
Honey, I...

30:03.870 --> 30:05.371
I want you to relax
and enjoy yourself.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.240
- You're a guest.
- OK.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.109
- Where's the powder room?
- Oh, oh... I know!

30:10.142 --> 30:13.179
It's right around...
I just think it's over there.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.948
- [TV plays music]
- I'm just assuming.
I've never been here before.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.250
Hey, everybody,
grab a seat. It's on!

30:21.020 --> 30:23.255
[man on TV] Welcome
to Calais, France.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.957
[applause]

30:26.158 --> 30:27.293
[Steve] There's Lauren!

30:27.326 --> 30:29.929
Where's Emily?
I don't see Emily.

30:29.962 --> 30:33.365
...all-around Gold medalist,
Nastia Liukin.

30:33.399 --> 30:36.602
Nastia, I understand you've
already got some news for us.

30:36.635 --> 30:39.872
Yes. There's been a
substitution on the US Team

30:39.906 --> 30:42.942
- Lauren Tanner
will be competing today...
- Yes!

30:42.975 --> 30:46.879
- ...in place of Emily Kmetko.
- [man] Big changes
for the USA.

30:46.913 --> 30:50.917
She probably just tweaked
her ankle or something.

30:50.950 --> 30:54.286
It happens all the time.
Don't worry.

30:54.320 --> 30:59.025
She went all the way
to France, and she doesn't
even get to compete...

31:06.398 --> 31:08.300
I really appreciate
your tip last night.

31:08.334 --> 31:12.171
- You did the right thing.
- I was worried about her...

31:12.204 --> 31:15.107
She's never been to Paris. No
telling what could've happened.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.944
Between you and me,

31:17.977 --> 31:20.312
I don't know if she's capable
of sticking to the rules.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.448
It's not her.
It's the way she was raised.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.270
[yells]

31:50.476 --> 31:52.344
Emily?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.918
[sobbing]

32:03.990 --> 32:06.325
The eyes of the world
are upon you.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.495
This is your chance to show
them what you're capable of.

32:09.528 --> 32:13.399
Your chance to make
your country proud.

32:15.367 --> 32:19.271
USA! U-S-A! Whoo!

32:32.118 --> 32:33.185
How'd Payson do?

32:33.219 --> 32:35.154
I think she felt good.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.256
When will they make
the announcement?

32:37.289 --> 32:39.425
Right after the competition.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.262
Too bad about Emily.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.199
Yeah, interesting how
the alternate got in.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.436
What are you saying?

32:50.469 --> 32:54.073
You were the big cheerleader
of getting Emily to Paris.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.541
Was that your plan all along?

32:55.574 --> 32:58.144
To get her benched so
you could take her spot?

32:59.145 --> 33:01.413
You know what really hurts?

33:01.447 --> 33:05.417
That we've been friends
since we were eight years old
and you think so little of me.

33:05.451 --> 33:08.420
I can't believe you'd think
I'm that conniving.

33:08.454 --> 33:11.357
I just wanted Emily
to see Damon because

33:11.390 --> 33:13.325
I know what it's like
to be in love.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.361
Right.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.230
And today, I will prove to you

33:18.264 --> 33:21.500
that I can have a boyfriend
who absolutely adores me

33:21.533 --> 33:23.435
and still beat you.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.205
We're competing
as a team, remember?

33:26.238 --> 33:27.806
Doesn't mean I can't out-score
you for the all-around.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.609
[chuckles] You are so on.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.365
[crowd cheering]

33:55.434 --> 33:58.470
- Beat that.
- Just watch me.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.515
[man] It's on.
This is a serious competition.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.850
Why did you come back?

34:11.883 --> 34:14.386
Because neither of us
want to say goodbye.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.655
So then, damn it, why did we?

34:18.457 --> 34:21.093
So I could have
this great dream of mine.

34:21.127 --> 34:24.363
This dream that makes me feel so
happy and gives me so much joy.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.265
So come on, now.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.434
You know, I could just quit.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.170
Then we could be together.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.239
Listen, you don't mean that.

34:33.272 --> 34:37.509
I'm sick of the rules and
the training and the sacrifices.

34:37.543 --> 34:42.414
And for what?
To get benched because I
snuck out to see a friend?

34:42.448 --> 34:46.218
I'm sick of being told
what I can't do.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.587
What I can't have
and who I can't have.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.856
When does my life
get to be mine?!

34:50.889 --> 34:52.658
When do I get control?

34:52.691 --> 34:55.227
Listen, you have control now.

34:55.261 --> 34:59.498
You don't have to do gymnastics,
it's your passion,

34:59.531 --> 35:01.633
it's who you are,
you can't not do it.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.436
And all the hard work
and sacrifices you've made

35:04.470 --> 35:06.138
will be worth it
when you are standing

35:06.172 --> 35:08.507
on that Olympic podium in 2012.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.443
You have...
You'll have your dream.

35:14.346 --> 35:15.614
But I won't have you.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.451
Who says?

35:20.652 --> 35:22.488
Listen. I have an idea.

35:23.455 --> 35:27.459
In two years, we meet here,

35:27.493 --> 35:30.596
in Paris,
under the Eiffel Tower.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.333
- [scoffs]
- I'm totally serious. It's
two years. It's not that long.

35:35.601 --> 35:38.570
After the Olympics,
we meet here...

35:40.206 --> 35:42.608
...and then we'll decide
if it's goodbye.

35:45.444 --> 35:46.612
Is it a date?

35:50.382 --> 35:51.717
Yeah.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.220
And you'd better
be wearing Gold.

36:05.231 --> 36:08.967
This is not goodbye,
Emily, OK?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.403
This is...

36:11.437 --> 36:13.372
This is not goodbye.

36:25.384 --> 36:29.355
So Nastia, not exactly
the results we were
expecting so far.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.357
Well, Kaylie Cruz and
Lauren Tanner

36:31.390 --> 36:33.359
are going neck and neck
for the gold.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.961
Something seems to be
fueling these two and
making them better.

36:35.994 --> 36:38.297
Here's Lauren Tanner on beam.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.565
- Yes! All right!
- [guests murmur excitedly]

37:14.566 --> 37:16.234
[Steve] Whoo!

37:19.371 --> 37:21.340
So she's not hurt?

37:23.409 --> 37:26.278
Well, I guess we'll
find out what happened
when they get back.

37:26.312 --> 37:27.679
Keep me posted
if you hear anything.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.047
Thanks, Sasha.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.550
[man continues on TV]

37:31.583 --> 37:33.619
Well, I guess now
I can see now why

37:33.652 --> 37:35.587
everyone was too busy
to watch at my house.

37:35.621 --> 37:39.525
Everyone's been asking where
you were. Weren't they, Steve?

37:39.558 --> 37:41.026
I wasn't sure
if you were coming

37:41.059 --> 37:43.495
because you never RSVP'd
to my voicemail.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.331
I wonder if I have
the wrong number...

37:45.364 --> 37:47.733
Well, it's OK, because
I had to work, anyway.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.034
That's why I'm here. Work.

37:49.067 --> 37:52.638
We need your signatures
on these. For Lauren.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.773
Sure, sure.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.608
[applause]

38:21.567 --> 38:23.535
[crowd cheering]

38:25.537 --> 38:28.607
I know I wasn't invited,
so you can cut the crap.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.810
I really don't care,
but I am curious, why?

38:31.843 --> 38:34.746
You know how it is. I'm running
for the Parents' Board

38:34.780 --> 38:39.385
and this little gathering
is for Rock parents
who have a stake in...

38:40.552 --> 38:42.721
You don't think
Payson's coming back.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.657
So I don't have stake.

38:45.691 --> 38:48.894
I don't have any money,
which would make me
valuable at The Rock.

38:48.927 --> 38:52.097
Or a daughter who's number
one anymore, so I don't count?

38:52.130 --> 38:53.665
I'm nothing to you.
Is that it?

38:53.699 --> 38:56.902
- No, not nothing...
- I got news for you.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.604
Payson is coming back.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.639
She's going to be petitioned
on the National Team.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.741
And then she's gonna go
to Worlds and the Olympics.

39:02.774 --> 39:05.143
And I'm so confident
my daughter

39:05.176 --> 39:06.344
will be number one
at The Rock again,

39:06.378 --> 39:10.382
I've decided to run
for President of the
Parent Board, too.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.118
Wait. Don't you need
me to sign these,

39:13.151 --> 39:14.620
so you can take 'em
back to The Rock?

39:14.653 --> 39:16.688
Take 'em yourself.

39:16.722 --> 39:19.525
Kim! Kim! They're
talking about Payson!

39:19.558 --> 39:22.794
...of Payson Keeler's petition
to be on the National Team.

39:22.828 --> 39:25.531
And here is the word
from the National Committee.

39:25.564 --> 39:28.434
Unfortunately, Payson's
petition has been denied.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.902
She will not be joining
the National Team this year.

39:33.439 --> 39:34.840
- Excuse me.
- Kim...

39:39.210 --> 39:42.848
No offense,
but this party sucks.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.951
[man] The judges' final scores
are being tabulated...

39:45.984 --> 39:49.955
I'm happy for every
single crappy thing
you've ever done to me.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.958
Because it's only made
me a better gymnast.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.564
- I was better than you today.
- Hmm. We'll see about that.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.832
[man] With the
all-around gold...

40:02.668 --> 40:05.437
...from the United States
of America,

40:05.471 --> 40:08.607
- US National Champ,
Kaylie Cruz!
- Yes!

40:08.640 --> 40:10.776
- [crowd cheering]
- [Kaylie] Yes!

40:24.255 --> 40:26.825
[man] And now,
taking Silver...

40:28.494 --> 40:33.499
...from Romania, Asta Cochov!

40:36.502 --> 40:38.436
And winning the bronze...

40:39.905 --> 40:43.475
...from the United States
of America,

40:43.509 --> 40:45.777
Lauren Tanner!

41:10.902 --> 41:14.072
You've gotta be used to looking
up by now, huh, Lauren?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.977
It's a shame Payson Keeler
was so unprepared.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.581
I know. I told her
to delay her petition,
but Sasha Belov insisted.

41:22.614 --> 41:26.051
If that man's not stopped,
he will ruin these girls.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.920
[man] And team gold
goes to Romania!

41:28.954 --> 41:32.691
[crowd cheering]

41:34.860 --> 41:38.764
[man] And the USA
close behind in second.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.946
We might have won the Gold,

41:54.980 --> 41:56.548
if you hadn't
let your team down.

41:57.983 --> 41:59.951
I hope he was worth it.

41:59.985 --> 42:02.654
* Ready or not

42:02.688 --> 42:05.857
* My words grow loud

42:07.859 --> 42:10.662
* Can you hear? Can you tell?

42:10.696 --> 42:12.097
[phone ringing]

42:12.130 --> 42:14.099
* I'm making sound

42:17.002 --> 42:19.971
* Ready or not

42:20.005 --> 42:23.141
* My heart starts to pound

42:24.743 --> 42:28.914
* Can you hear? Can you tell?

42:28.947 --> 42:29.981
* I'm making sound

42:30.015 --> 42:32.718
She's gonna need her coach.

42:32.751 --> 42:33.785
She's gonna need her mom.

42:33.819 --> 42:36.087
It's important you keep
the dream alive... For her.

42:36.121 --> 42:40.626
* I see north
I see brightly *

42:42.961 --> 42:44.930
[applause]

42:44.963 --> 42:47.866
[woman] Good job, girls!
Congratulations!

42:47.899 --> 42:49.901
All right!

42:52.638 --> 42:57.909
* Can I fall and
still break free? *

43:00.979 --> 43:05.851
* Can I sound
to you perfectly? *

43:09.420 --> 43:14.660
* Can I fall and
still break free? *

43:18.063 --> 43:22.801
* Can I sound
to you perfectly? **
