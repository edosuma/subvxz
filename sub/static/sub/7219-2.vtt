WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.646
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:04.471 --> 00:08.851
I had to kill three deliverymen, I got no dope,
and my ear's damn near been shot off.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.047
We're going to Detroit.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.717
Where's our dope?

00:13.213 --> 00:14.521
One more shipment. That's it.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.783
- When?
- Two days. Maybe three.

00:16.984 --> 00:19.225
I want you to swear you'll leave my family be.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.124
- Or?
- Or you'll die here in this limo.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.229
I'm afraid I'm fresh out of ideas.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.667
Florida's tapped out for the Crowes.

00:29.796 --> 00:31.002
Let me ask you something.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.469
Do you have a cousin Dewey in Kentucky?

00:33.567 --> 00:36.173
I don't know shit about no dead Coast Guard.

00:36.236 --> 00:37.214
What about your kin?

00:37.304 --> 00:38.806
Them Florida Crowes are bad news.

00:38.872 --> 00:43.514
I take it you're here because my good
friend Judge Bishop has Ava's case.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
How much?

00:45.312 --> 00:46.723
$300,000.

00:46.813 --> 00:47.814
It won't happen.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.323
You killed him.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.343
- I didn't mean to do nothing wrong!
- But you did.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.106
- Yeah, but I didn't mean to.
- But you did!

01:08.669 --> 01:10.205
- Didn't he?
- Yep.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.113
And you know what bring me down?

01:12.205 --> 01:14.947
You got all these damn crackers in this crew,

01:15.108 --> 01:17.554
and it's the brother
that had to go and screw shit up!

01:26.019 --> 01:27.191
What are we looking at?

01:27.254 --> 01:28.858
He say they shorted him.

01:29.556 --> 01:30.864
You believe him?

01:35.596 --> 01:38.133
What is this shit right here?

01:38.699 --> 01:41.703
Is this where my missing drugs ended up?

01:42.035 --> 01:43.446
It ain't like that, HR.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.375
I just messed up is all.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.385
So you ain't crooked. You're just a moron.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.883
Or maybe it was my fault.

01:52.312 --> 01:55.384
Was I unclear in my instructions?

01:55.816 --> 01:58.387
You said pick up the dope in Lexington,

01:58.986 --> 02:01.967
I pay them two kids,
and then bring the dope back.

02:03.223 --> 02:04.463
Sounds pretty simple to me.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.227
- Can o' corn.
- Yep.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.133
Look, they didn't give me all of the dope.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.768
- And you didn't weigh it out?
- It looked good!

02:11.098 --> 02:13.408
"It looked good."

02:13.567 --> 02:16.241
I'll go down there myself.
Okay. I'll take care of it.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.011
No. No. Condition you're in?

02:19.106 --> 02:20.312
I'm gonna send them two.

02:21.508 --> 02:22.578
What about me?

02:23.410 --> 02:27.756
Don't worry... Brothers will take care of you.
Let's go.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.987
So, we SEAL Team 6 it.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.861
- What?
- SEAL Team.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.330
- Yeah.
Lightest shit wins.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.427
Go.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.610
What are the doctors sayin?

02:49.202 --> 02:51.944
They had to put him in a coma
for the swelling to go down.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.115
Maybe he wake up. Maybe not.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.953
Maybe he be a vegetable. Maybe not.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.457
Were you there when it happened?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.394
It was Crowder, wasn't it?

03:06.553 --> 03:08.624
Skinny guy, about medium height?

03:09.322 --> 03:14.237
Dark hair. He wears it up all crazy.
Smile that nearly blinds you.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.833
You know, Boyd Crowder.

03:18.398 --> 03:19.809
Yeah, that's him.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.641
You are a very lucky girl.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.916
You just crossed paths
with the most dangerous man in Kentucky,

03:27.007 --> 03:28.315
and you lived to tell the tale.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.911
Are you afraid of him?

03:30.911 --> 03:34.654
Afraid? No. lam not afraid of Boyd Crowder.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.049
In fact,

03:36.850 --> 03:39.592
I would bet
that Boyd Crowder is afraid of me.

03:40.320 --> 03:45.497
Look, you have nothing to worry about
as long as you keep me close, okay?

03:50.997 --> 03:54.501
This is horse shit.
The only thing I'm guilty of is being rich.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.038
And now, thanks to Obama,
I got a target on my back.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.952
Doesn't matter to us if you're guilty,
but you're under arrest.

04:02.042 --> 04:05.046
You and your property are seized
till the court makes its determination.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.090
Yeah, well, till that happens,

04:06.179 --> 04:08.090
I want these cuffs off
and you people out of my house.

04:08.181 --> 04:11.458
Actually, according to this piece of paper,
it's our house now.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.190
You got any idea what that thing is worth?

04:17.423 --> 04:19.802
What, like, 100 bucks?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.369
That's a third-model Colt Dragoon

04:22.462 --> 04:25.636
used by Confederate general,
William Mahone.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.869
So more than 100?

04:28.368 --> 04:30.370
Probably more than your annual salary.

04:31.638 --> 04:34.141
Though I have a car stereo
probably costs more than you make,

04:34.241 --> 04:35.379
so that ain't sayin' much.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.716
That's a lot of money
for a gun that probably doesn't shoot.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.720
The hell it doesn't.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.454
I've got a negro down in Alabama
makes them load special for me.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.392
This doesn't bother you at all?

04:44.551 --> 04:46.497
I make sure
he don't keep the guns loaded in the house.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.894
Your girlfriend's a very tolerant woman.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.798
Gloria ain't my girlfriend.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.229
She's the maid.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.800
She takes care of my more personal needs.

04:54.895 --> 04:55.896
So who's this?

04:56.163 --> 04:58.575
That's Manuela. She keeps the house.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.303
She also sautÃ©s up a mean iguana,
if you're ever in the mood.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.471
Is very tender.

05:02.736 --> 05:03.806
Rest of the house is clean.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.144
You should see this place.
We got a bowling alley in the basement.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.919
All this for doing Detroit's dirty laundry.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.979
You know what?
When this ugliness blows over,

05:12.078 --> 05:13.682
you ought to come on over
and do my laundry,

05:13.780 --> 05:15.259
and I'll tell you all about it.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.519
We done with him?

05:20.086 --> 05:21.087
Givens.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.166
When this is over, I'm gonna own

05:23.256 --> 05:26.601
every cheap-suit-wearing, no-class,
shit-kickin' one of you.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.468
Lieutenant, I'm gonna have to
ask you to slow down.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.972
Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something.

05:33.099 --> 05:36.012
Well, I could swing by now if...

05:36.970 --> 05:38.540
All right. See you shortly.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.276
Where are you going?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.445
Lexington PD lieutenant just accused me of

05:42.509 --> 05:44.785
being responsible
for his kid's dope problem.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.321
Are you being funny?
'Cause I can't tell any more.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.620
Shouldn't take more than an hour.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.527
You realise we came in your car, right?

06:10.637 --> 06:13.811
You were right. This sounds fantastic.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.590
That's my goddamn car!

06:54.381 --> 06:56.224
Jesus Christ. He's dead?

06:56.283 --> 06:57.762
It was an accident.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.695
An accident? You accidentally killed him?

07:00.854 --> 07:03.698
What I mean to say is,
I didn't intend to kill him.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.204
We needed him alive, Boyd.
We needed him to recent his testimony.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.603
I'm aware of that, baby.

07:08.895 --> 07:12.035
Don't worry.
I still have everything under control.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.701
How? How is this under control?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.275
You got an incorruptible judge

07:16.369 --> 07:20.283
and now a witness
whose sworn statement is set in stone.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.114
This trial takes place in 10 days.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.085
What, you want to
rely on this asshole to get me off?

07:24.611 --> 07:25.954
Now, ain't nobody talkin' to you.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.819
Put those headphones back on.

07:28.882 --> 07:32.455
Baby, now, this case ain't ever
gonna see the inside of a courtroom.

07:32.552 --> 07:33.724
Now, I am sorry.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.658
But I am doing everything that I can for you.

07:38.158 --> 07:41.002
And I would appreciate it
if you would keep that in mind.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.303
I am sorry. You're right.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.246
It just sucks in here, Boyd.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.817
Long, humiliating days.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.147
I know.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.584
Well, I've been here, too, remember?

08:02.115 --> 08:05.324
You are the only person
in the world I got lookin' out for me.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.762
I always have and I always will.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.464
Don't lose faith in me now.

08:16.796 --> 08:17.797
<i>So what did you tell her?</i>

08:18.665 --> 08:21.271
- That I have the situation under control.
- But you don't.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.503
Do you get paid to
tell me shit I already know?

08:25.472 --> 08:27.315
Now, did you hear from the Canadians
regarding the shipment?

08:27.807 --> 08:29.878
Just that we're still on track for delivery
in two days.

08:29.976 --> 08:33.446
Well, for $900,000, I want more than an ETA.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.293
Well, if you boys are looking for a drink,
you've come to the wrong bar.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.804
We're not thirsty, Boyd.
Well, we don't sell doughnuts.

08:51.731 --> 08:54.712
So why don't you
take your fat asses out of here?

09:04.811 --> 09:06.484
What, she supposed to
mean something to me?

09:06.746 --> 09:07.884
You don't know her?

09:07.981 --> 09:10.188
No. I don't.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.597
But if I wasn't already engaged,
I wouldn't mind making her acquaintance.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.356
Bad news.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.202
See, she was there last night
when you tried to kill her husband.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.106
Excuse me.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.733
Go ahead, hon. Is that the guy?

09:25.832 --> 09:28.039
Because I've been waiting
a long goddamn time for this.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.171
No.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.379
What did you say?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.245
It's not the guy. It's not him.

09:41.514 --> 09:42.686
Is this a joke, Mara?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.254
Or maybe
this is just a language-barrier thing,

09:45.852 --> 09:47.854
but what does skinny, medium height,

09:47.921 --> 09:51.027
with dark, spiky hair
and big shiny teeth mean where you're from?

09:51.357 --> 09:52.427
Because here in America,

09:53.426 --> 09:55.133
it means that piece of shit right there.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.764
I know what I said.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.372
You check again.
And you make goddamn good and sure.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.038
Is this the man who assaulted your husband?

10:13.279 --> 10:14.656
Like I said, it's not him.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.627
Well, if there's nothing else.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.160
I'm sorry about your husband, ma'am.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.664
Thank you.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.179
So my wife catches him smoking it in
our basement with some kind of vaporizer.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.414
Right in my own damn house.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.450
That your son there in the lobby?

10:46.513 --> 10:47.992
Hell no. That's the boyfriend.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.082
I wasn't aware she had one.

10:49.682 --> 10:50.990
You expect me to believe that?

10:51.084 --> 10:54.088
Look, I don't know what she told you,
but we're actually not that close.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.127
She said you were practically her stepfather.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.465
I'm a father myself. Not hers, mind you.
But I understand what you're going through.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.200
Stop with the bullshit
and put it in your book, all right?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.501
I went out and I found this girl.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.803
I was prepared to
rain legal shit down upon her

11:05.865 --> 11:07.845
until she started talking marshal, marshal.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.977
You are here as a courtesy.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.947
If you don't go in there
and set her straight, I will,

11:12.005 --> 11:14.110
and neither you nor her will want that.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.994
I remember my first time in the cell.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.399
Me and Mike Graves
got caught smashing mailboxes

11:30.490 --> 11:33.369
with a baseball bat
out of the window of a '64 Impala.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.837
This ain't my first time in a cell.

11:35.962 --> 11:39.136
Mike's dad had him out within an hour.
I spent the night.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.742
Your dad sounds like a real asshole.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.245
Can't say I was surprised,

11:43.570 --> 11:47.143
knowing your history the way I do,
to hear you been slingin' weed.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.511
But I was surprised to
hear you'd been selling it to a cop's kid.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.489
Well, if you'd met the kid,

11:54.547 --> 11:57.357
you'd know I can't ruin
a future someone doesn't have.

11:57.584 --> 11:58.722
If that ain't bad enough,

11:58.818 --> 12:02.027
you come in here
and paint the walls with my name.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.527
Look, Raylan, I know I screwed up.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.836
I know.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.675
I'm sorry that I brought you into this.

12:16.002 --> 12:19.108
But you get me out of here,
I swear I won't ask for your help again.

12:20.006 --> 12:25.217
Next time, lead with that.
It's bullshit, but at least it's an attempt.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.187
Raylan? Where you going?

12:28.715 --> 12:31.457
Well, I'm gonna let you ride the rap,
young lady, same as everyone.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.929
If you need anything,
just ask for Officer Stick-up-his-ass.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.363
He'd be happy to help you.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.401
You shittin' me, Raylan?

12:43.630 --> 12:44.870
Hey' man.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.641
Pig, I'm talkin' to you.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.942
Pig is slang for cop. I ain't a cop,

12:49.035 --> 12:50.878
but there's plenty of them here
if that's what you want.

12:51.137 --> 12:53.777
- Well, yeah, but where's Loretta?
- She ain't comin'.

12:53.873 --> 12:54.874
Yeah, but she said that...

12:54.941 --> 12:56.215
She was wrong.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.251
You ain't gonna get her out?

12:59.379 --> 13:01.723
- What's your name?
- Derrick Waters.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.158
Let me tell you something, Derrick.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.729
You sell weed to a cop's kid,
you end up in a cell.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.459
You want to end up in a cell, too,
or you want to get out of my face?

13:08.888 --> 13:12.062
Loretta said you were cool,
but you're a total dick.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.396
- All right. Well, have a good one.
- Yeah. Whatever.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.736
- I see you've met the boyfriend.
- Yeah.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.904
I've dated
a few world-class douchebags in my time,

13:21.968 --> 13:24.642
but that little shit-stain
is in a league of his own.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.582
I swear. You ever have that feeling

13:26.639 --> 13:30.246
like you just walked away from your car
and you're not sure if you locked it or not?

13:30.810 --> 13:34.485
It's amazing. I even remember to
put on underwear before I leave the house.

13:36.282 --> 13:37.920
- You're confused.
- A little.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.920
- I'm Alison.
- Raylan.

13:40.186 --> 13:41.790
I know. I saw your picture in the paper.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.356
- How'd I look?
- Taller.

13:44.190 --> 13:47.103
Sorry, are you a lawyer or...

13:47.260 --> 13:49.672
I'm Loretta's social worker.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.642
I guess
I was dealing with someone else before.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.803
Kind of heavyset?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.607
Regina. Retired. She wasn't your type.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.275
Probably best for everyone, then.

14:00.606 --> 14:01.607
Where's Loretta?

14:01.708 --> 14:02.709
Still in her cell.

14:03.509 --> 14:07.855
You law guys...
You only know one way to do things.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.985
You think just leaving her in there all alone
will scare her straight,

14:11.451 --> 14:14.625
but what it really does, it makes her feel
like no one gives a shit about her.

14:14.954 --> 14:16.331
Boyfriend seems to care.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.636
- Was that a joke?
- An attempt.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.304
All he cares about
is slingin' molly at rich kids' parties.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.072
So he's an entrepreneur, then.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.039
He can't even pee over his own shoes.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.133
Which is why I was gonna go talk to him,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.305
see if I can convince him
he ain't Loretta's type.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.678
Then I'd like to call you,
let you know how it went.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.882
- You got a card or something?
- Card?

14:33.973 --> 14:36.249
I thought finding people's what Marshals do.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.057
Now, Boyd's always done
right by you, hasn't he?

14:42.148 --> 14:44.924
And all he expects in return
is his money every week.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.088
Look, you know I want to do right by Boyd.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.063
But the money is in the office,
and Dewey's in there.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.759
- So get him out.
- How should I do that?

14:51.023 --> 14:53.503
Tell him one of the whores is on fire.
What do I care?

14:53.659 --> 14:56.003
Why are you in such a big hurry?
Can't you wait just a little bit?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.166
And do what?

14:57.263 --> 14:58.401
Well, it is a whorehouse.

14:59.665 --> 15:03.078
Look, when Dewey leaves,
I'll go in the office and I'll get you Boyd's cut.

15:03.169 --> 15:06.082
I can't wait around here all day
just 'cause you ain't got no balls.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.242
What's going on there?

15:08.775 --> 15:09.879
Nothin'.

15:10.676 --> 15:11.711
Nothin?

15:12.512 --> 15:17.689
Well, I could have sworn I heard Carl here
tell my manager he don't got no balls.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.527
Well, Carl's upset with me 'cause...

15:23.689 --> 15:25.396
I let you fire Chrissy.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.804
Yeah. That's right.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.598
She was definitely my favourite girl.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.202
Chrissy was fat.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.114
Yeah, 'cause that's what I like.

15:39.405 --> 15:40.907
More cushion for the pushin'.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.414
Well, see,
this here's Dewey Crowds whorehouse,

15:43.543 --> 15:47.582
and Dewey Crowe's whorehouse
ain't gonna have no fatties runnin' around.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.750
You know, Carl ain't the only one, boss.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.955
I've had other clients ask after her.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.119
About the big one?

15:53.219 --> 15:55.665
I mean, think on account of
she's a bit on the heavy side,

15:55.755 --> 16:00.568
so she's been forced to
develop her skill set in other ways.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.932
I'll tell you what... You let me hire her back,
I'll keep her out in the trailer.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.566
You won't even know she's here.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.439
Yeah, I guess
this is what it means being the boss.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.241
Got to give the customers what they want.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.244
Okay.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.911
Hire that big bitch back.

16:18.344 --> 16:21.814
And any more problems arise,
I'll be in the office.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.318
That's all I could think of.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.158
Just call me when you got the cash.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.337
Look, we gave him all the stuff.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.806
Don't talk that shit to me, man.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.342
I'll bust your head wide open
lyin' to me like that.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.434
Hey.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.178
How's everybody doing?

16:44.937 --> 16:47.543
Now, I know the kid,
but I don't believe we've met.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.013
Are you guys friends of Derrick's?

16:54.480 --> 16:55.823
What's your names?

16:57.116 --> 16:58.459
You boys speak English?

16:58.618 --> 16:59.653
A little.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.459
You understand this?

17:03.122 --> 17:04.156
You a cop?

17:04.457 --> 17:05.800
Marshals Service.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.207
Well, we considered law enforcement.

17:10.496 --> 17:12.031
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.643
But what we really wanted, though,
was military, but then,

17:14.867 --> 17:17.313
you got to be on base all day and shit.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.310
But a lawman, though...
A lawman get to have his nights to himself.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.587
So what held you back?
High-school diploma?

17:23.843 --> 17:24.844
Nah.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.824
If you shoot someone,
you got to have a reason.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.894
Then you got to go fill out
a whole lot of paperwork.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.184
Not for you?

17:31.417 --> 17:33.158
No, we don't do that shit.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.698
But what you want with this guy?

17:34.987 --> 17:37.058
He piss you off? What you do?
You sleep with his daughter?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.391
He screwed your daughter?

17:38.925 --> 17:40.233
My daughter's in diapers.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.272
Damn. That must be awfully upsetting, then?

17:45.164 --> 17:46.336
Let's go.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.018
Nice job, asshole.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.778
Anything else?

17:58.878 --> 17:59.879
Yeah.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.223
You're breaking up with Loretta.

18:03.282 --> 18:05.523
And do it like a gentleman, huh?

18:05.851 --> 18:07.455
Make her feel like she's too good for you.

18:07.553 --> 18:10.432
Tell her that being with someone like you
is just gonna hold her back.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.034
We talkin' about the same Loretta here?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.297
Take it easy, Derrick.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.264
Alison. Raylan Givens.

18:18.364 --> 18:19.365
Yes.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.742
Took all of our office's
considerable resources,

18:21.867 --> 18:25.076
we let a fugitive escape,
but I did manage to get your number.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.979
Well, I just had a chat with our mutual friend,

18:28.074 --> 18:30.714
and I thought you might want to
get together and discuss it.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.993
Can't smoke that in here, ma'am.

18:42.922 --> 18:43.957
They said I could.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.400
You might want to try the stairwell
at the end of the hallway.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.944
Well, I think we need to talk, don't you?

19:04.076 --> 19:05.919
That was your friend.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.288
Well, that depends on
your definition of a friend.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.324
He's a nice enough fella.

19:13.419 --> 19:16.593
But I wouldn't ask to
borrow his corduroy jacket.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.994
Is that one of them electronic cigarettes?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.195
You want to try?

19:22.294 --> 19:23.432
No.

19:24.330 --> 19:28.107
I think if I'm gonna smoke,
I'll do it the old-fashioned way.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.640
I fancy myself a gifted student
in human behaviour, but you...

19:35.941 --> 19:38.114
Well, I can't quite pin down.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.990
Now, it's obvious he didn't die.
Why don't you take it from there?

19:44.517 --> 19:48.158
Once I realised that Lee was still alive,
I had to try and save him.

19:49.055 --> 19:53.333
Well, I respect that.
I mean, the man is your husband, after all.

19:53.959 --> 19:58.806
I blame myself for not confirming his demise,
but I was in a state.

19:59.799 --> 20:04.873
And where I get confused
is why you decided not to give me up.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.650
Lee will never again be
the man that I married.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.483
So I'm in a tough spot.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.749
And I decided
that the best person to help me is you.

20:16.682 --> 20:17.888
Well...

20:19.819 --> 20:23.494
I would much rather help you than hurt you.

20:25.324 --> 20:26.894
So start talkin'.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.168
I thought America would be wonderful...

20:33.332 --> 20:39.112
But then I ended up here in Harlan,
with an older man, preparing dead bodies.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.249
So, you see, I just want to go home now.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.079
You want that money.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.885
$300,000 and I'm gone.

20:51.517 --> 20:57.263
Well, what if I just finish what I started?
Then you can get all of Mr Paxton's money.

20:58.124 --> 21:02.197
I signed a contract
that I must be married for 10 years

21:02.862 --> 21:04.535
or I get nothing.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.541
And there's no way
they would let him live that long.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.147
Well, as much as
I would like to accommodate you,

21:14.874 --> 21:17.548
I can't produce
that kind of cash at the moment.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.558
You're a very resourceful man.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.226
You'll figure it out.

21:27.820 --> 21:33.065
And as long as I get my money soon,
everything will be fine.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.960
Excuse me! If I could have your attention,
please, for a minute!

22:01.153 --> 22:04.623
I know you're all expecting Mr Crowder,
but since he seems to be indisposed,

22:04.690 --> 22:06.931
I'm gonna speak on his behalf.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.339
Now, I know there have been concerns
among you, our valued distributors,

22:11.430 --> 22:14.434
regarding the
inconsistent nature of our product's delivery.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.175
But I am here to tell you
that everything is fine, all is well,

22:18.604 --> 22:21.448
and that
the new shipment will be here very soon.

22:22.308 --> 22:23.309
When?

22:25.477 --> 22:26.888
I'm sorry. To whom am I speaking?

22:34.720 --> 22:36.290
I believe I just made that clear.

22:36.622 --> 22:41.731
You made it clear it'd be soon.
I need to know because I need more.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.704
No, you don't. In fact, you needless.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.639
You should count yourself grateful
you got what you got.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.177
Now, if there are no further questions...

22:47.233 --> 22:50.146
We're out on the street
risking our necks for you, man.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.177
Just to get a tiny little piece of your pie.
Is that right?

22:53.239 --> 22:54.240
Yeah!

22:54.340 --> 22:55.978
Am I right? Am I right?

22:56.041 --> 22:58.043
- Yeah!
- All right. Yeah.

22:58.510 --> 23:02.253
And you're gonna stand up there
in that cute little suit of yours

23:03.315 --> 23:04.988
and you're gonna refuse to
shoot us straight?

23:05.050 --> 23:06.757
Now, if you can't give us a specific time,

23:06.852 --> 23:09.856
at least you could tell us if you're having
a problem with your distributor.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.871
A question worthy of
the White House press corps.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.167
I always knew you had it in you, Cyrus.

23:17.263 --> 23:20.176
Now, how many people
in this room have a cell phone?

23:20.232 --> 23:24.009
That's an amazing invention,
makes your life better every single day,

23:24.069 --> 23:26.845
but sometimes your service drops out.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.884
Now, you don't care about broken satellites.
You don't want to know the how.

23:31.343 --> 23:34.688
You want to know the
"Why can't I make my goddamn phone call?"

23:35.014 --> 23:39.861
Now, rest assured,
Mr Duffy and I have fixed the signal

23:40.419 --> 23:42.228
and your service will be restored.

23:42.288 --> 23:44.029
I need to know when, Boyd.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.228
Day after tomorrow.

23:46.292 --> 23:49.603
Now, I want you all to know
how much we appreciate your patience

23:49.695 --> 23:51.470
and your loyalty, Cyrus,

23:51.563 --> 23:55.033
and because talk is cheap and liquor is not,

23:55.100 --> 23:57.102
drinks are on the house.

23:58.570 --> 23:59.640
Sorry I'm late.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.447
Hey. Interrupting something?

24:06.545 --> 24:08.547
- No.
- No. We can pick this up later.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.821
Just want to let you know
we're all set with the Monroe case.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.554
He's locked up. House is secured.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.059
Rachel told me.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.998
She also told me
that you drove off in Monroe's car...

24:17.556 --> 24:19.263
Taking it to storage, I assume?

24:19.325 --> 24:20.326
That's right.

24:20.559 --> 24:23.563
So, is it in storage now?

24:25.064 --> 24:26.099
Basically.

24:27.232 --> 24:31.009
If you really wanted to piss this guy off,
why not just move in?

24:31.236 --> 24:32.681
No, I bet he never thought of that.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.947
Hate to give up my suite above the bar,
but if it helps, I'll lake the hit.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.853
We've done it before
with high-end properties.

24:39.945 --> 24:42.289
Stationed a guy there,
see if anything pops up.

24:42.748 --> 24:43.852
You okay with it?

24:44.083 --> 24:47.326
Am I liable for any damages
that he causes if I say yes?

24:47.419 --> 24:48.864
- No.
- Then yes.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.428
You're in. Enjoy.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.932
Everything all right?

24:56.161 --> 24:57.162
Yeah.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.365
But while I have you...

25:00.132 --> 25:03.113
We received an interesting phone call
while you were in Florida.

25:03.535 --> 25:04.536
Creditors?

25:05.304 --> 25:06.476
Sammy Tonin.

25:07.439 --> 25:08.611
Sammy Tonin called here?

25:09.274 --> 25:13.984
Called here, asked for you,
not 24 hours before he turned up dead.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.992
And I'm just hearing about this now?

25:16.315 --> 25:20.627
Well, I had to make sure
it wasn't a prank call, verify the number.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.189
Wasn't hard to do after he turned up dead.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.459
What'd he want?

25:24.723 --> 25:26.964
I was about to ask you that question.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.471
Maybe he knew the end was near,
was lookin' to make a deal.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.468
Yeah, I thought about that.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.636
There you go.

25:34.867 --> 25:38.713
But if he was wanlin' to make a deal,
he already knew all those people in Detroit.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.078
Why would he call you?

25:43.709 --> 25:46.349
Remember a few months back,
FBI was sniffing around,

25:46.412 --> 25:48.915
Sammy and I had
a face-to-face at the stables at Keeneland?

25:49.515 --> 25:50.516
Vaguely.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.990
Said if he was ever lookin' to make a deal,
shoot me a call.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.664
Is that Loretta?

25:59.324 --> 26:00.325
Yeah.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.194
We good?

26:02.528 --> 26:04.098
Yeah. Yeah.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.043
Give her my best.

26:08.934 --> 26:10.004
Loretta.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.446
What the hell did you do?

26:15.707 --> 26:16.913
Listen...

26:17.910 --> 26:20.857
I know it feels like
there'll never be another boy,

26:21.914 --> 26:24.053
but trust me,
you have so many in your future.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.856
Raylan, what are you talking about?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.192
Derrick breaking up with you.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.595
Derrick didn't break up with me.

26:28.687 --> 26:29.688
Why not?

26:30.355 --> 26:32.528
- He's missing, Raylan.
- Since when?

26:32.858 --> 26:34.030
Since last night

26:34.359 --> 26:35.929
when you said
you were all up in his business.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.201
Business? That's what we're calling it now?

26:41.533 --> 26:44.480
You want to find him,
you best tell me what's going on.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.375
How far down you bury this shit?

26:49.141 --> 26:50.711
I'm almost there. I know it.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.777
I'm hungry.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.050
I'm starting to lose faith in you, D.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.755
I swear.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.385
I was out here with her two days ago.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.156
I buried it myself.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.059
What?

27:07.159 --> 27:09.400
It's not here. That's what.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.462
No. No. It's here.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.564
- Give me the shovel.
- No, no. It's here. It's here.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.974
- Let me see that.
- No!

27:14.967 --> 27:16.071
Just a little deeper.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.446
You kill him, I ain't diggin'.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.980
The shit ain't buried here.
The bitch moved it on him.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.017
You know what? You a dumb-ass.
You know that?

27:23.842 --> 27:25.913
It never occurred to you?

27:26.011 --> 27:28.787
That's a smart move
not to trust your pussy ass.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.923
It stings, don't it?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.520
Listen, man'
may not be much consolation for you,

27:34.653 --> 27:38.260
but you was gonna be in this hole either way.

27:38.423 --> 27:39.527
No, no, no. Please.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.195
Hey, look who it is, Frick and Frack.

27:44.530 --> 27:45.873
You gonna make me do the paperwork?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.441
- You all right?
- No.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.639
Homeboy hit me with a shovel.

27:52.137 --> 27:54.447
You don't want to arrest us.
Arresting us ain't no good.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.678
Why's that?

27:56.008 --> 27:58.113
'Cause Hot Rod's
just gonna keep goin' after them kids.

27:58.210 --> 28:01.623
Hot Rod... Dunham from Memphis?

28:03.448 --> 28:05.325
Shit, Derrick,
how'd you get messed up with him?

28:06.351 --> 28:07.455
Guess.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.830
God damn it, Loretta.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.527
Mooney.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.900
You know, I thought you and I
were gonna be able to have a little bit of fun.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.871
But not only do you embarrass me,

28:55.334 --> 28:57.007
but I've got to hear from my deputies

28:57.069 --> 29:00.016
that Boyd Crowder
came to visit you at the hospital.

29:00.105 --> 29:01.083
I don't know what you're...

29:01.173 --> 29:03.710
Not another word, baby girl.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.386
You know what people around here see
when they look at you?

29:14.019 --> 29:19.128
They see a sexy woman that
cashed in her self-respect for a rich husband.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.138
Basically...

29:24.229 --> 29:25.867
They see a whore.

29:29.735 --> 29:32.545
And when I arrest you
for trying to kill your husband,

29:33.205 --> 29:37.620
there ain't a jury in the great state
of Kentucky that won't convict your ass.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.381
Now, I want you to go home,

29:43.548 --> 29:47.394
and I want you to think long and hard
about the night that Lee was attacked.

29:48.387 --> 29:53.735
Then I want you to come into the station,
and we're gonna do this the right way.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.570
You got that?

29:57.462 --> 29:59.408
Yeah.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.572
Good.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.078
Now, you drive safe now, honey.

30:14.179 --> 30:17.183
You know, if you was smart,
you'd be gone before they showed up.

30:17.449 --> 30:18.860
Apparently, I ain't that smart.

30:19.184 --> 30:20.322
"Apparently"?

30:20.686 --> 30:22.962
Yeah, where you messed up was
when you called your girl.

30:23.021 --> 30:25.001
You know, the chick you called in the car.

30:25.624 --> 30:28.366
The date you broke off
when you was comin' out here.

30:28.593 --> 30:29.628
He means Alison.

30:29.695 --> 30:30.833
I know who he means.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.704
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Alison.

30:34.199 --> 30:35.439
Whats the deal with that?

30:36.101 --> 30:38.012
What you should have told her was

30:38.103 --> 30:40.379
not that you weren't gonna
come to dinner tonight, but that...

30:40.972 --> 30:42.451
You ain't ever comin' to dinner again.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.454
My general rule is, you keep talkin',
I put you in the trunk.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.824
You're a lousy conversationalist.

30:50.716 --> 30:51.717
Last chance.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.644
Look at this motley crew.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.680
I don't suppose your boys are unarmed.

31:14.039 --> 31:18.419
You know, I get a call from a Givens
at this late hour, I get nervous.

31:18.643 --> 31:21.715
"A Givens"?
I guess that means you knew Arlo.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.522
I knew him well.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.995
We did plenty of business over the years.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.422
Good for you.

31:27.652 --> 31:30.565
Now, you want to hear the deal,
or you want to talk about my family?

31:31.022 --> 31:33.229
Is that what we're doin' here? Dealing?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.068
First Off,

31:35.660 --> 31:38.869
whatever transpired
between you and those kids gets squashed.

31:38.930 --> 31:42.707
No vendetta, no debt.
You tell me it's over, and it stays that way.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.713
Would you prefer that I respond
point by point or should I wait till the end?

31:46.772 --> 31:48.376
- You can wait till the end.
- Okay.

31:48.507 --> 31:52.250
Second, no one in your organisation
steps foot in Kentucky again.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.120
You keep to Memphis,
and you leave me and mine out of it.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.620
Anything else?

31:57.749 --> 31:58.921
No, that's it.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.125
You see, the problem is,

32:01.553 --> 32:04.193
I entered into business with these kids,

32:04.956 --> 32:06.765
and they pulled a slick one on me.

32:07.459 --> 32:10.702
I can't let that slide, and furthermore,
I shouldn't have to.

32:11.096 --> 32:15.374
You get in the weed business with teenagers
and it's their fault when things go wrong?

32:16.368 --> 32:18.644
You the type of fellow
that walks under a flock of birds

32:18.737 --> 32:21.274
and is surprised
when he ends up with shit on his face?

32:23.942 --> 32:28.618
Just 'cause I knew your daddy,
don't think I won't have you killed right now.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.825
See, Arlo knew when 10 walk away.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.222
Did you learn nothin' from him?

32:35.720 --> 32:36.994
I learned a bit.

32:38.990 --> 32:39.991
When I was a boy,

32:40.559 --> 32:43.062
Arlo had this scam
stealin' mining equipment,

32:43.128 --> 32:45.335
shipping it south, tradin' it for cocaine.

32:45.764 --> 32:49.234
A couple company men
got wind of who was rippin' them off,

32:49.334 --> 32:50.574
and they went after Arlo and his crew.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.616
They shot up a couple spots,
including our house.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.307
They killed Casper Johns,

32:55.407 --> 32:57.751
wasn't with the crew,
was just living with us at the time,

32:58.176 --> 33:01.157
and then this other fella that Arlo
had been runnin' with since high school.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.255
You get what I'm sayin?

33:03.782 --> 33:07.320
Even before I went to Glynco
and trained to be a dead shot,

33:08.086 --> 33:09.929
I seen people kill one another,

33:10.455 --> 33:14.597
and I learned to be ready
in case they came after me to do me harm.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.271
In other words,

33:19.598 --> 33:21.805
I'll kill four of you
before you even clear your weapons

33:21.867 --> 33:24.541
and I'll take my chances with the other two,
and you see this star?

33:26.638 --> 33:28.618
That's gonna make it legal.

33:30.375 --> 33:33.447
Now, do we have an understandin' here?

33:59.404 --> 34:01.179
All right, Derrick, this is your stop.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.376
You serious?

34:06.811 --> 34:08.188
You want me to take the bus?

34:08.647 --> 34:10.058
Unless you'd rather walk.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.391
Derrick, I got a loaded gun.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.659
Get out of my car.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.667
All right. Whatever, man.

34:20.926 --> 34:21.927
Come on, Loretta.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.239
Loretta, let's go.

34:32.837 --> 34:33.907
Your call.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.882
Well, thanks for the ride.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.155
You lied to him, didn't you?

35:20.118 --> 35:22.064
Moved the money and didn't tell him.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.132
I'm not a total moron.

35:25.223 --> 35:26.998
Even though you knew
it might get him killed.

35:27.792 --> 35:28.793
It didn't.

35:29.327 --> 35:30.499
Shit.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.469
Your performance at the Marshals Office.

35:33.765 --> 35:37.770
Moved to tears 'cause he was missin' was
just so I'd take care of your problem for you.

35:37.902 --> 35:38.903
You played me.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.241
I didn't play you, Raylan.

35:44.242 --> 35:45.619
You are who you are.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.584
You were gonna go lookin' for Derrick
the moment I told you he was missin'.

35:51.116 --> 35:52.151
Loretta...

35:54.252 --> 35:58.496
In the future, do me a favour,
take it easy on the rest of us, huh?

36:14.305 --> 36:15.443
All right.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.182
Now, y'all pay close attention,

36:20.045 --> 36:21.456
and I'll show you how this shit is done.

36:23.381 --> 36:25.622
You ready, Crackpot? Yeah?

36:27.152 --> 36:28.859
All right. Now, don't go easy on me, now.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.661
Ready... No, no, no. Back here.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.834
Set...

36:38.797 --> 36:39.798
Go!

36:39.864 --> 36:41.810
Go. Go. Come on. Come on. Come on.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.140
Here it comes. Like a little jackrabbit.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.136
Oh, man!

36:45.303 --> 36:46.373
Shit!

36:47.005 --> 36:48.348
Damn, Cyrus!

36:48.406 --> 36:50.079
How many times you pump that thing?

36:50.175 --> 36:52.314
Don't be such a pussy.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.981
Shit didn't even break the skin.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.490
Let me see it. Let me see it.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.522
Tony B, pay the man.

36:59.818 --> 37:00.819
Bye-bye, Crackpot.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.227
Watch where you're goin'!

37:10.729 --> 37:14.233
You ain't got nothin' better to do
than shoot at runnin' junkies.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.776
Not until you showed up, I didn't.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.073
What's up, Candy?

37:17.435 --> 37:19.676
I don't know. You tell me.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.383
I'm afraid I'm a little dry right now.

37:23.708 --> 37:26.780
Well, in that case, then, so am I.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.124
Hold up. Hold up. Come here. Stay here.

37:34.853 --> 37:38.357
I might have heard something
about some shit comin' in.

37:39.357 --> 37:42.031
Give you the inside scoop
and a free taste you stick around a while.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.067
I'm listening.

37:44.696 --> 37:45.936
First, you got what I like?

37:51.703 --> 37:54.377
It'll be just like
your dick's in a popcorn machine.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.418
Shit comes in tonight.

38:00.612 --> 38:04.458
Be on the street first thing tomorrow mornin'.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.654
Well, you sure do know
how to make a girl happy.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.958
And now you're gonna return the favour.

38:16.661 --> 38:18.402
I got to tell you right now,

38:18.463 --> 38:22.172
there ain't a man on planet earth
ridin' high as Dewey Crowe.

38:23.735 --> 38:24.907
Hey, Dewey.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.914
Unless Hitler has risen from the grave
and is in my whorehouse,

38:30.175 --> 38:32.086
go away right now, Messer!

38:32.410 --> 38:35.289
You know I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't real important.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.489
But I do need you for a minute.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.453
I told him, you know,
he couldn't just go on and take stuff for free,

38:41.519 --> 38:43.089
but he said he's your kin.

38:44.823 --> 38:45.824
There he is.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.095
- Big time!
- Darryl.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.167
You got yourself a nice setup in here.

38:52.297 --> 38:53.537
Yeah, boy.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.611
It's good 10 see you, Cousin Dewey.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.148
Real good to see you, family.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.150
Ed, thanks for gettin' back to me so quick.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.051
You must not have anything to do up there.

39:05.143 --> 39:08.886
<i>Well, anything for Art Mullen
in the twilight of his great career.</i>

39:10.315 --> 39:11.885
You do lay it on thick, Ed.

39:12.116 --> 39:13.186
How can I help?

39:14.118 --> 39:17.463
I was just wonderin'
if your office had anything to do

39:17.522 --> 39:20.401
with the fallout from the
Sammy Tonin fiasco.

39:20.558 --> 39:23.232
That's the men of the FBI
and DPD on the front lines.

39:23.461 --> 39:26.533
<i>We come in if they need
extra firepower or a seizure team. Why?</i>

39:26.965 --> 39:31.141
I was hopin' you guys might have some
information about Sammy's whereabouts

39:31.202 --> 39:33.239
the night Nicky Augustine got killed.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.909
- The shooting on the tarmac?
- That's right.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.816
- The one in Lexington?
- Yeah.

39:38.643 --> 39:41.180
<i>Guess I can do a little puking around,
see what I can find.</i>

39:41.246 --> 39:42.350
Well, I'd appreciate it.

39:42.580 --> 39:43.650
All right. You got it.

39:43.815 --> 39:44.816
All right.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.659
So, you think she'll be okay?

39:50.755 --> 39:52.325
Until she screws up again.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.165
Well, maybe she won't.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.171
She's the daughter of a murdered pot farmer.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.704
She is who she is. Ain't gonna change.

39:59.163 --> 40:02.007
Well, at least you're not
feeding me bullshit to get laid.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.770
I was just about to get to that.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.342
I hate to break it to you,

40:06.771 --> 40:09.547
but this is not gonna end up
with us wakin' up together.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.878
You're just gonna use me and go home?

40:15.013 --> 40:17.687
When I was 17, I had this job,

40:17.782 --> 40:21.252
and I was sellin' military equipment
at trade shows,

40:21.586 --> 40:23.122
and they didn't care I was underage.

40:23.221 --> 40:26.259
And they would brief me on sarin gas mask,

40:26.357 --> 40:29.702
and then I would go
and I would shake my ass and...

40:30.194 --> 40:34.973
Charm these four-star generals
into buying half a million units.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.067
Sounds pretty good.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.406
It was shit.

40:38.069 --> 40:40.413
But I did make good money,
and I got to travel,

40:40.772 --> 40:44.413
which was a nice perk,
being from Penhook, Virginia.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.045
Anyway, I met a few military boys.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.494
And the military guys
turned you off from men in the service.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.128
Lord, no.

40:54.218 --> 40:58.291
Those boys,
they were fit and polite and sweet as pie.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.327
No, it wasn't till I got this job
and started dating cops

41:02.226 --> 41:04.137
that I got turned off from all y'all.

41:04.262 --> 41:05.900
Maybe I'm different.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.101
You are different.

41:07.832 --> 41:13.111
You're livin' in a criminal's house,
drivin' his car, drinkin' his wine.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.583
- I have my own place.
- Above a college bar.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.683
And then there's the kid in Florida.

41:18.843 --> 41:20.254
She's fine with her mother.

41:20.578 --> 41:22.819
Yeah, but shouldn't you and her
be tryin' to make it work?

41:23.247 --> 41:24.248
We did.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.326
That's how we ended up with the kid.

41:27.685 --> 41:28.755
Should I keep going?

41:29.087 --> 41:31.431
There's some red flags, I admit.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.827
Doesn't mean I'm not capable of change.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.963
Just give me a target to shoot for. I'll hit it.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.108
Like what? Gettin' me in that hot tub?

41:39.297 --> 41:40.867
- That's not what I was thinkin'.
- No?

41:41.632 --> 41:42.872
Then what is?

41:46.871 --> 41:48.145
You like to bowl?

42:12.797 --> 42:14.708
Mara.

42:37.422 --> 42:39.732
Pull over. Now.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.030
What the hell happened?

42:44.162 --> 42:46.039
They hit our damn shipment.

43:08.386 --> 43:10.263
Who the hell could have done all this?

43:11.355 --> 43:12.857
Clean it up.

43:14.192 --> 43:15.762
The cars, the bodies...

43:18.696 --> 43:20.868
All of it.
