(bats chirping)

00:07.129 --> 00:08.808
(static crackling)

00:08.808 --> 00:11.308
(eerie music)

00:16.531 --> 00:18.051
(static crackling)

00:18.051 --> 00:20.968
(ghostly groaning)

00:22.411 --> 00:23.926
(screaming)

00:23.926 --> 00:26.426
(eerie music)

00:27.396 --> 00:28.890
- [Announcer] Here she
comes, the woman that makes

00:28.890 --> 00:32.009
you ask are those lash
marks or stretch marks?

00:32.009 --> 00:35.230
Are those remnants of lustful
pains or varicose veins?

00:35.230 --> 00:40.070
It's Sister Sadie Safeword!

00:40.070 --> 00:41.460
- Seriously?

00:41.460 --> 00:43.320
That is my intro?

00:43.320 --> 00:44.153
- [Announcer] What?

00:44.153 --> 00:45.930
I, uh, said your name right, didn't I?

00:45.930 --> 00:50.930
- I will have you know I am
100% grade A fresh as a daisy.

00:52.950 --> 00:53.830
Stretch marks?

00:54.890 --> 00:56.630
I don't see any!

00:56.630 --> 00:59.210
I don't see any on these pumpkins.

00:59.210 --> 01:02.060
Anyway, enough of that, cretin,

01:02.060 --> 01:04.739
how are my movie-loving maggots?

01:04.739 --> 01:07.240
Are you ready for another painful picture

01:07.240 --> 01:09.951
to pound your putrid
peepers into submission?

01:09.951 --> 01:11.490
(crowd cheering)

01:11.490 --> 01:13.700
Good to hear, my wormy weirdos.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.100
You have pleased your mistress.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.880
But do not think that
I will go easy on you.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.495
I'm in a very torturous mood.

01:21.495 --> 01:25.150
Slave, bring me the sack
of cinematic sadism!

01:27.560 --> 01:29.360
Thank you, slave.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.630
You will be thrashed soundly
for your loyal service.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.370
Let's see what we have today.

01:36.950 --> 01:38.050
What in the holy hell?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.660
Horndog's Beach Party.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.220
What, what is this?

01:45.220 --> 01:48.980
Is this like a porno or something?

01:48.980 --> 01:52.140
Is this even a real movie?

01:52.140 --> 01:54.324
- [Announcer] It's on tape, isn't it?

01:54.324 --> 01:55.780
- Of course it's on tape.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.550
But look at it, look at the label.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.890
It looks like child wrote this.

02:02.820 --> 02:05.430
- [Announcer] A movie is
a movie is a movie, right?

02:05.430 --> 02:09.080
I mean, do you think our
audience tunes in for high art?

02:09.080 --> 02:14.080
- I would hope that they
tune in for these babies.

02:14.310 --> 02:18.230
The movies are just, how you say, gravy.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.260
- [Announcer] Whatever helps
you sleep at night, sister.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.590
- Don't make me come over there!

02:24.720 --> 02:29.720
Anyway, let's get to the
movie or whatever this is.

02:32.610 --> 02:36.170
I don't know, your guess
is as good as mine.

02:36.170 --> 02:37.860
If is beach party,

02:37.860 --> 02:41.420
perhaps there will be girls in bikinis.

02:41.420 --> 02:46.390
Or maybe there will be sand
where it doesn't belong.

02:46.390 --> 02:49.620
Now that is true torture!

02:49.620 --> 02:51.190
I will be back to check on

02:51.190 --> 02:54.560
the progress of your torture soon.

02:56.270 --> 02:58.890
You know, I went to beach once.

02:58.890 --> 03:02.740
There was beautiful sun, happy people,

03:02.740 --> 03:05.650
children laughing, I hated it!

(static crackling)

03:18.840 --> 03:19.700
- [Announcer] Come on down to

03:19.700 --> 03:21.750
the 10th annual Horndog's Beach Party.

03:22.664 --> 03:25.980
Located on beautiful
Venice Beach, California.

03:27.110 --> 03:30.040
And oh boy, do we have all sorts of fun

03:30.040 --> 03:31.910
in store for your whole family.

03:32.984 --> 03:35.370
(upbeat music)

03:35.370 --> 03:39.390
Plus, our famous wet t-shirt
competition for adults only.

03:42.520 --> 03:46.160
This Sunday, don't miss it.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.884
Sponsored by the Riverside County Jaycees.

03:49.884 --> 03:51.667
(static crackling)

03:51.667 --> 03:54.250
(upbeat music)

06:41.210 --> 06:42.220
- Hey man.

06:42.220 --> 06:43.860
Yeah.

06:43.860 --> 06:45.810
Yeah, I'm out here by the paddle boats.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.580
Alright.

06:49.580 --> 06:51.605
Yeah, I'll see you in a little bit.

06:51.605 --> 06:54.188
(upbeat music)

07:15.374 --> 07:18.291
(car horn honking)

07:23.723 --> 07:25.630
(peaceful music)

07:25.630 --> 07:27.340
- [Cory] This is so awesome that your aunt

07:27.340 --> 07:29.240
let us have the condo for the weekend!

07:30.720 --> 07:32.080
- Well, at least part of it.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.820
You know, Auntie Brinke never
lets a buck go to waste.

07:41.460 --> 07:45.800
- Hmm, I really hope the
two girls are actually cool.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.994
- I'm sure they'll be good.

07:48.994 --> 07:51.400
It's just I hope they
don't party too hard.

07:53.380 --> 07:56.170
- [Cory] When did you
become such a buzzkill?

07:56.170 --> 07:59.241
Didn't you use to rule
the beach party scene?

07:59.241 --> 08:01.900
- (laughing) That was like 30 years ago!

08:05.365 --> 08:07.948
(upbeat music)

08:32.059 --> 08:33.659
- Thanks man, get ya on the app.

08:35.980 --> 08:38.080
- Dude, this is gonna be so sick.

08:38.080 --> 08:38.913
Look at this.

08:39.750 --> 08:40.582
- Hey fellas.

08:44.168 --> 08:47.001
(seagulls crying)

08:52.990 --> 08:56.500
- Huh, uh, I guess nobody's
here to meet us yet.

08:57.492 --> 08:58.325
- Let me see.

09:03.790 --> 09:05.459
It says if this guy named Dusty isn't here

09:05.459 --> 09:07.343
just get the key from under the doormat.

09:07.343 --> 09:08.176
- Oh.

09:10.811 --> 09:11.898
Here it is.

09:11.898 --> 09:13.550
Got it!

09:13.550 --> 09:17.050
(record scratching music)

09:31.636 --> 09:32.469
Not bad!

09:33.371 --> 09:34.380
Not bad at all.

09:35.710 --> 09:37.670
- This will do.

09:37.670 --> 09:39.441
Two bad it's only two bedrooms.

09:39.441 --> 09:40.530
- Yeah.

09:40.530 --> 09:41.660
We'll just have to take turns

09:41.660 --> 09:43.102
when we got the chicks in there.

09:43.102 --> 09:48.102
- Oh, yeah!

09:56.270 --> 09:57.510
- Hey, nice day, ladies!

09:58.540 --> 09:59.373
- Hi!

10:04.148 --> 10:05.890
- So you think we can do it?

10:05.890 --> 10:07.220
- What?

10:07.220 --> 10:08.053
- Come on, man!

10:08.053 --> 10:09.450
The best beach party ever!

10:10.680 --> 10:11.513
- Hope so.

10:11.513 --> 10:14.308
I guess we'll have to see what
our weekend roommates think.

10:14.308 --> 10:15.141
- Yeah.

10:17.260 --> 10:18.093
Hey, you okay?

10:18.970 --> 10:20.520
- Yeah, just don't like travel.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.430
- That's true.

10:22.430 --> 10:24.280
Those 4 a.m. flights suck.

10:25.540 --> 10:26.620
- Hey, do you need the bathroom?

10:26.620 --> 10:28.180
I'm gonna take a shower.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.620
- Ah, no, I'm cool.

10:29.620 --> 10:31.090
- Cool.

10:31.090 --> 10:31.923
- Sweet.

10:45.457 --> 10:48.374
(knocking on door)

10:54.430 --> 10:56.274
- Check under the doormat for the key.

10:56.274 --> 10:59.890
- Okay.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.748
They must already have it.

11:02.748 --> 11:05.697
Hmm, maybe they're
already down at the beach?

11:05.697 --> 11:08.280
(upbeat music)

11:28.741 --> 11:31.408
Hey, this place is pretty sweet!

11:32.752 --> 11:34.941
- I've been here a few
times back in high school.

11:34.941 --> 11:36.191
Always had fun.

11:40.730 --> 11:43.313
(upbeat music)

11:50.430 --> 11:51.910
- Killer view!

11:56.672 --> 11:58.222
I can't wait to get down there.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.308
- I think I hear the shower.

12:15.089 --> 12:17.510
- I'm gonna go pee and change.

12:17.510 --> 12:19.220
- Shouldn't you wait until she's done?

12:19.220 --> 12:20.230
- It'll be fine.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.030
It's a great way to meet new people.

12:29.432 --> 12:31.260
(upbeat music)

12:31.260 --> 12:32.093
Hello!

12:34.010 --> 12:35.430
I hope you don't mind.

12:35.430 --> 12:37.380
We just got in and I need to go change.

12:38.970 --> 12:39.803
Is that okay?

12:41.240 --> 12:42.670
- Uh, sure.

12:45.202 --> 12:48.616
- Thanks.

12:48.616 --> 12:51.136
It sure is a nice place here.

12:51.136 --> 12:56.136
- [Loren] Mhmm.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.400
- I'm gonna go change real quick

12:58.400 --> 13:00.048
and go down to the beach.

13:00.048 --> 13:01.304
You should join us.

13:01.304 --> 13:02.548
- [Loren] Sounds like fun!

13:02.548 --> 13:03.381
(toilet flushing)

13:03.381 --> 13:07.997
- [Cory] Whoops, sorry!

13:07.997 --> 13:10.914
(knocking on door)

13:13.345 --> 13:16.357
(upbeat music)

13:16.357 --> 13:18.690
(screaming)

13:22.760 --> 13:23.593
- What was that?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.300
- Whoa!

13:26.300 --> 13:27.840
- Okay, what's the deal?

13:27.840 --> 13:29.120
- They're guys!

13:29.120 --> 13:29.953
- What?

13:31.270 --> 13:32.103
Who are you?

13:32.950 --> 13:34.580
Why are you here?

13:34.580 --> 13:36.980
- We're obviously here
because of your double D.

13:38.603 --> 13:40.180
- You son of a bitch.

13:40.180 --> 13:41.110
Cory, call the police.

13:41.110 --> 13:42.750
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:42.750 --> 13:45.280
We're here because of the
Desired Destination Rental.

13:48.043 --> 13:48.876
- Hold up.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.960
Here's our receipt for the
Desired Destination Rental.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.150
- It says Stacy and Loren.

14:00.990 --> 14:02.680
- Yeah, I'm Stacy.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.513
- And I'm Loren.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.300
- So, who are you two?

14:09.450 --> 14:10.283
- I'm Dusty.

14:11.456 --> 14:12.289
- And I'm Cory.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.490
- What the hell are we
gonna do about this?

14:15.490 --> 14:16.380
- Do about what?

14:16.380 --> 14:19.830
We already paid Brinke or
whoever, here's our receipt.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.530
- There's no hotel rooms within 20 miles,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.640
we just have to make it work.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.310
- I'm gonna call Auntie Brinke about this.

14:28.310 --> 14:31.090
- Excuse me, is it okay
if I go back and change.

14:32.790 --> 14:35.090
- Uh, I'm gonna go get
something on too, okay?

14:39.300 --> 14:40.133
- So...

14:43.220 --> 14:44.360
I'll come change too.

14:45.512 --> 14:48.095
(upbeat music)

14:57.407 --> 15:00.074
(phone ringing)

15:04.860 --> 15:05.920
- Hello?

15:05.920 --> 15:08.160
- Hi, Auntie Brinke.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.400
- Oh, hi Dusty.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.350
Did you and Cory make it okay?

15:11.350 --> 15:12.550
- Yes we did, thank you.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.800
- Is everything alright?

15:16.260 --> 15:18.620
- Well, there's a slight issue.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.490
- Oh no, what's that?

15:22.560 --> 15:24.140
- We are having to share it with a couple

15:24.140 --> 15:26.490
of guys who rented through
Desired Destination.

15:27.430 --> 15:28.890
- What?

15:28.890 --> 15:30.590
I thought I turned those two down.

15:31.450 --> 15:32.560
- Well, they're here.

15:33.890 --> 15:35.220
- That doesn't make any sense.

15:35.220 --> 15:37.390
I specifically turned down Brad and Tad

15:37.390 --> 15:39.080
and accepted Loren and Stacy so there

15:39.080 --> 15:40.760
wouldn't be any boy trouble.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.880
- Loren and Stacy are here.

15:42.880 --> 15:45.250
- Did they bring Brad and Tad with them?

15:45.250 --> 15:46.900
If so, I'm really gonna be pissed.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.780
I told them no more than
two for their group.

15:49.780 --> 15:51.580
- No, there is no Brad and Tad here.

15:52.420 --> 15:53.660
- Well that's good.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.850
What two boys did Loren
and Stacy bring with them?

15:56.850 --> 15:57.750
- Just themselves.

15:58.670 --> 16:00.810
- Well then I don't see the issue.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.780
Hopefully they're a couple of nice girls.

16:02.780 --> 16:06.460
- No, Loren and Stacy are the boys.

16:07.450 --> 16:08.650
- Really?

16:08.650 --> 16:12.060
Did Brad and Tad change their
names just to get the place?

16:12.060 --> 16:14.960
- No, Brad and Tad are nowhere here!

16:14.960 --> 16:17.920
Loren are Stacy are two
totally different guys.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.740
- So instead of Brad and Tad, I accepted

16:21.740 --> 16:24.520
two other boys that I thought were girls?

16:24.520 --> 16:25.400
- Yes!

16:25.400 --> 16:28.150
- Huh, I wonder why their
parents named them like that?

16:29.991 --> 16:31.390
Oh well.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.440
- So is there anything we can--

16:33.440 --> 16:35.740
- Oh, I'm so sorry, I gotta get going.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.410
I'm sure you'll all work it out.

16:37.410 --> 16:39.360
Oh, and don't get too crazy there,

16:39.360 --> 16:41.270
Brigitte still likes to freak out and call

16:41.270 --> 16:43.670
the neighborhood association
at the first sign of fun.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.503
- But--

16:44.503 --> 16:46.050
- You know, she had the
nerve to call them a few

16:46.050 --> 16:48.200
weeks ago when I had
the music up too loud.

16:49.150 --> 16:50.120
It's a good thing she didn't know

16:50.120 --> 16:52.320
why I really had it up so loud.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.670
I bet her gardener is
still smiling (laughing).

16:55.740 --> 16:57.120
Anyway, y'all have a great time.

16:57.120 --> 16:57.953
Love you.

16:59.264 --> 17:02.310
(doorbell ringing)

17:02.310 --> 17:03.570
- I'm in insanity land.

17:08.223 --> 17:11.420
(bemusing music)

17:11.420 --> 17:12.510
Yes?

17:12.510 --> 17:16.882
- Hi, I'm Brad, and this is Tad.

17:16.882 --> 17:18.040
- 'Sup.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.619
- [Dusty] Of course you are.

17:19.619 --> 17:21.609
- You know it, dude.

17:21.609 --> 17:23.490
Are you Loren or Stacy?

17:23.490 --> 17:24.430
- [Dusty] I'm Dusty.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.160
- Ooh, dirty name.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.190
Cool, brah.

17:28.190 --> 17:30.570
- Anyway, is Loren or Stacy here?

17:30.570 --> 17:32.180
Just wanted to tell 'em no hard feelings

17:32.180 --> 17:33.970
on losing the place to them.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.900
We got a room just down the street

17:35.900 --> 17:37.640
and was wondering if
those two chicks wanted

17:37.640 --> 17:40.340
to join us in that Horndog
Beach Party competition?

17:41.740 --> 17:43.910
- They are dudes and not your type.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.220
- Bro, that sucks.

17:48.220 --> 17:49.720
- Dude, I know.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.570
- What's up, bro?

17:52.200 --> 17:53.390
She was so uncool, bro.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.910
- Dude, that chick definitely had some

17:55.910 --> 17:57.650
kind of massive stick up her ass.

17:57.650 --> 17:58.483
- Totally bro.

17:58.483 --> 18:00.320
I mean, what are we gonna do?

18:00.320 --> 18:01.760
Those two chicks have the best spot

18:01.760 --> 18:04.130
on the beach and we can't even use it.

18:04.130 --> 18:05.510
- I don't know, dude.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.030
- And what about those
two chicks being dudes?

18:08.030 --> 18:09.880
I mean, what's up with that?

18:09.880 --> 18:11.910
- Dude, I think we may have to do

18:11.910 --> 18:14.100
something about these two dudes.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.720
- Like what, bro?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.610
- Dude, the way I look at it,

18:17.610 --> 18:19.330
if we can't have the
best spot on the beach

18:19.330 --> 18:22.250
for a party, we're gonna
make sure these two dudes

18:22.250 --> 18:25.610
and Miss Stick-up-her-ass
don't win the best beach party.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.510
- I knew it!

18:34.510 --> 18:35.900
They're planning a party.

18:38.303 --> 18:39.510
- Totally, bro.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.030
- Totally, dude.

18:41.030 --> 18:43.170
- However, they do look very nice.

18:45.190 --> 18:48.280
No, I mustn't give in to temptation!

18:49.240 --> 18:52.040
I've gotta let the
neighborhood association know.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.370
Right.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.330
They won't take my calls
anymore without proof.

19:02.520 --> 19:06.780
Well, if it's proof they
want, it's proof they'll get!

19:12.950 --> 19:15.730
- Dude, what are we gonna do about this?

19:15.730 --> 19:16.563
- I don't know.

19:16.563 --> 19:17.920
Um, it's really awkward.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.860
Uh, we could make sure,
we could go talk to them,

19:20.860 --> 19:24.350
or try to figure out how
to make it less awkward.

19:24.350 --> 19:25.540
- I mean, I guess we could talk to them,

19:25.540 --> 19:26.880
but I thought we were just gonna have

19:26.880 --> 19:28.910
like a dude's party weekend.

19:28.910 --> 19:29.910
This was gonna be sick.

19:29.910 --> 19:31.490
Now we got two chicks here?

19:31.490 --> 19:32.323
- [Loren] But I mean, they're not

19:32.323 --> 19:33.610
half bad looking, you know.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.110
- [Stacy] Right, they ain't ugly.

19:36.110 --> 19:36.943
- No.

19:38.290 --> 19:40.750
- Well, we gotta do something.

19:40.750 --> 19:44.230
They saw me in my underwear,
so it's already kinda awkward.

19:44.230 --> 19:46.290
- I do think that I am going to go talk

19:46.290 --> 19:48.600
to Cory though and try to make amends.

19:50.170 --> 19:51.900
- That would be a good idea.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.960
So it's less awkward all weekend.

19:53.960 --> 19:54.860
I don't know, man.

19:57.260 --> 19:59.490
Look, dude, just go talk to her.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.120
- Uh, yeah.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.530
- You don't have to apologize
or anything, just talk to her.

20:06.530 --> 20:07.450
- Yeah.

20:07.450 --> 20:08.290
I mean, she's really cute and I think

20:08.290 --> 20:10.875
it would make things
better for the weekend.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.910
- This is gonna be good for you.

20:12.910 --> 20:15.069
- Yeah, yeah.

20:15.069 --> 20:18.427
- Alright.

20:18.427 --> 20:21.094
(phone ringing)

20:24.109 --> 20:26.290
- Hi.

20:26.290 --> 20:27.540
Okay.

20:27.540 --> 20:28.373
Hey.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.600
Yeah, um, she's being a little more

20:32.600 --> 20:34.570
stubborn than I thought she would be.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.460
She's kinda stressed out.

20:38.460 --> 20:41.180
It turns out the two
we're sharing the condo

20:41.180 --> 20:42.930
with are actually a couple of guys.

20:45.232 --> 20:47.658
Mhmm.

20:47.658 --> 20:49.950
Yeah, they're kinda cute.

20:52.890 --> 20:56.280
Hmm, I dunno, we'll just see how it goes.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.420
Okay, tell ya what.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.580
You guys come around three, by that time

21:02.580 --> 21:04.750
it'll be super late and Dusty just

21:04.750 --> 21:06.700
totally has to go along with the party.

21:09.122 --> 21:09.955
Oh, shoot.

21:11.820 --> 21:13.750
One of the straps of my top ripped.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.150
I have to get a new one
before the party starts.

21:17.280 --> 21:21.810
Well yes, but I'm trying to
start with the top on first.

21:24.060 --> 21:26.060
Okay, see you guys around three.

21:27.040 --> 21:27.940
Okay, bye.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.940
(knocking on door frame)

21:31.940 --> 21:32.773
Come in!

21:33.750 --> 21:35.950
- Oh, I'm sorry.

21:36.930 --> 21:39.000
I can come back if you like.

21:39.000 --> 21:39.990
- No, it's okay.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.150
- I just wanted to
apologize for what happened

21:43.150 --> 21:44.650
in the bathroom earlier today.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.440
- That's so sweet of you.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.310
- I just don't want you thinking

21:48.310 --> 21:50.710
I'm some sort of creep or anything.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.930
- Let's just say there were
a few misunderstandings.

21:53.930 --> 21:55.970
- Yeah, I'll say.

21:56.940 --> 22:00.760
- So, what makes you boys
come out here to Cali?

22:00.760 --> 22:01.930
- Stacy always wanted to come

22:01.930 --> 22:04.792
to this beach party weekend, so I...

22:04.792 --> 22:08.420
- Oh, you mean the Horndog Beach Party?

22:08.420 --> 22:11.460
- Uh, yeah, uh.

22:13.615 --> 22:14.448
- Oh yeah.

22:17.869 --> 22:20.409
(coughing)

22:20.409 --> 22:21.909
Yeah, sex panther.

22:26.108 --> 22:28.140
- I'm sorry, I gotta go.

22:31.110 --> 22:32.597
- He's going to be fun.

22:34.227 --> 22:37.477
(rhythmic eerie music)

23:02.190 --> 23:06.830
- How about the, uh,
whatever the hell that was?

23:07.800 --> 23:11.880
Painful enough for you,
my masochistic minions?

23:11.880 --> 23:13.110
I don't know about you,

23:13.110 --> 23:17.038
but I think this one
has left me speechless.

23:17.038 --> 23:19.788
(crowd cheering)

23:21.390 --> 23:22.290
No, you know what?

23:23.630 --> 23:25.070
Just for that outburst,

23:25.070 --> 23:28.140
I think I am going to
talk about this movie.

23:28.140 --> 23:31.450
First off, something I'm sure none of you

23:31.450 --> 23:34.530
would have any experience
with, but this movie

23:34.530 --> 23:38.784
has more padding than a bra on prom night.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.450
(rim shot music)

23:40.450 --> 23:42.670
Not too mention the gardener,

23:42.670 --> 23:45.600
who is apparently in
totally different time zone

23:45.600 --> 23:49.340
from everyone else around
him that he's talking to.

23:49.340 --> 23:52.010
Then we have the male and the female lead,

23:52.010 --> 23:56.250
and they have approximately
a 20 foot height difference.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.220
Step stool, buy one!

23:59.110 --> 24:01.240
Then there is this lady who's trying

24:01.240 --> 24:04.100
to stop all these frisky frolics,

24:04.100 --> 24:06.070
but she's the kind of woman who would

24:06.070 --> 24:09.900
never turn down a good time, trust me.

24:09.900 --> 24:12.290
It takes one to know one.

24:12.290 --> 24:15.480
And, and--

24:15.480 --> 24:16.840
- [Announcer] Playing
devil's advocate here,

24:16.840 --> 24:19.250
I should mention that Uncle Rob, I mean,

24:19.250 --> 24:23.210
our producer, of this
program, in conjunction

24:23.210 --> 24:25.670
with the award losing Hollywood Studios

24:25.670 --> 24:28.370
that provide our top shelf
filmed entertainment,

24:28.370 --> 24:31.930
require you contractually to say

24:31.930 --> 24:34.560
at least one positive thing.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.220
- Brinke Stevens.

24:36.220 --> 24:41.220
We are in the presence of
true scream queen royalty.

24:41.730 --> 24:46.730
I bow to her in all of
her beauty and glory.

24:46.930 --> 24:49.560
- [Announcer] See, I
knew you had it in ya!

24:49.560 --> 24:50.860
- That check better clear.

24:52.350 --> 24:54.560
- [Announcer] Anything else you wanna say?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.440
- Anything else I have to say.

24:56.440 --> 24:59.360
Have you even been watching the movie?

24:59.360 --> 25:01.430
- [Announcer] In so many ways.

25:01.430 --> 25:02.520
- In so many ways?

25:02.520 --> 25:05.580
What does this even mean, in so many ways?

25:05.580 --> 25:08.650
- [Announcer] I mean I was
thinking about the film.

25:08.650 --> 25:10.780
- You went around the corner for another

25:10.780 --> 25:14.260
one of those special
massages again, didn't you?

25:14.260 --> 25:16.710
- [Announcer] Yes, the $20 bill

25:16.710 --> 25:19.110
was just burning a hole in my pocket.

25:19.110 --> 25:23.530
- So you leave me alone
to suffer with this movie?

25:23.530 --> 25:26.100
Well, not totally alone.

25:26.970 --> 25:29.140
I think it is time to turn the screws

25:29.140 --> 25:32.290
ever tighter on you, my filthy maggots.

25:32.290 --> 25:33.950
Roll the rest of the movie!

25:35.410 --> 25:38.060
Announcer, you may want to consider

25:38.060 --> 25:40.800
Purelling yourself, thoroughly.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.660
- Hey dude, you all right?

25:45.660 --> 25:46.493
- [Loren] Yep!

25:48.250 --> 25:50.833
(mellow music)

26:03.590 --> 26:04.680
- Oh, come on!

26:05.970 --> 26:08.433
Look, I know things got
mixed up with the reservation

26:08.433 --> 26:11.270
or whatever, but that's not our fault.

26:12.630 --> 26:13.880
- I know.

26:13.880 --> 26:14.713
- What?

26:16.130 --> 26:18.720
Didn't catch that.

26:18.720 --> 26:19.928
- I know.

26:19.928 --> 26:21.320
I'm sorry about that as well.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.113
- It's cool.

26:26.790 --> 26:29.130
- It's just this weekend
is not turning out

26:29.130 --> 26:31.110
the way I thought it would at all.

26:31.950 --> 26:34.050
- So, what did you have in mind.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.110
- I hoped it could be an all nice

26:38.110 --> 26:40.480
and relaxing weekend on the beach.

26:40.480 --> 26:43.720
- Relax, are you serious?

26:43.720 --> 26:46.170
This is like one of the biggest college

26:46.170 --> 26:48.550
party weekends ever for this area.

26:48.550 --> 26:50.520
Why would you pick this weekend?

26:53.140 --> 26:54.200
- I don't know.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.448
- Hmm, alright.

26:57.430 --> 26:58.263
Interesting.

26:59.370 --> 27:00.400
- What?

27:00.400 --> 27:01.440
- I think you just wanted to come

27:01.440 --> 27:03.810
down here and party all weekend.

27:03.810 --> 27:04.850
- No, I just--

27:04.850 --> 27:09.040
- Look, did you know it was
gonna be like this this weekend?

27:09.040 --> 27:11.800
- Yes, but that doesn't mean anything.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.260
- But you did know, and you still

27:14.260 --> 27:16.560
chose these dates for your weekend.

27:18.610 --> 27:20.500
- What are you, a psychology major?

27:21.991 --> 27:23.720
- Uh, actually yeah, yeah.

27:24.842 --> 27:26.846
I just finished my first
year in grad school.

27:26.846 --> 27:27.965
- Perfect.

27:27.965 --> 27:29.840
- Hey Dusty!

27:29.840 --> 27:30.890
- Yes?

27:30.890 --> 27:32.570
- Can you take me swimsuit shopping?

27:32.570 --> 27:34.090
Mine just broke.

27:34.090 --> 27:36.300
- Sure, I'm gonna get a coffee as well.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.133
- Great.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.700
- It wouldn't work out here.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.220
This part of the beach is shared

27:42.220 --> 27:44.600
with the crazy neighborhood
lady next door,

27:44.600 --> 27:46.570
she will call the association

27:46.570 --> 27:48.260
about everything that happens here.

27:48.260 --> 27:49.093
- Oh really?

27:53.420 --> 27:56.690
So why doesn't she just
move, why does she stay here?

27:56.690 --> 27:58.110
- Because she loves this beach.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.460
This is where she used
to spring break herself.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.240
Cory, you ready?

28:06.940 --> 28:07.820
- Yep, I'm ready.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.120
- Sorry about the attitude earlier.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.320
- Oh, it's cool, me too.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.140
See ya.

28:17.140 --> 28:17.973
- [Cory] Bye.

28:23.450 --> 28:25.940
- They left, you can come out!

28:32.710 --> 28:34.380
So what happened?

28:34.380 --> 28:36.080
- Uh, I don't know.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.350
I was talking to Cory and
she came on to me, and--

28:39.350 --> 28:40.810
- Dude, alright!

28:42.000 --> 28:44.220
- And then I freaked out
and rushed to the bathroom.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.053
- What?

28:48.330 --> 28:49.163
Really?

28:51.870 --> 28:53.940
- I rinsed the shower out pretty good.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.720
- Oh, gross.

28:58.050 --> 28:58.883
- It was wild.

28:59.970 --> 29:01.110
It took everything I had just to knock

29:01.110 --> 29:02.260
on her door and I hadn't been in

29:02.260 --> 29:04.110
a situation like that since Jennifer.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.000
- Baby steps, man.

29:07.350 --> 29:08.183
Baby steps.

29:22.050 --> 29:25.810
- So, what are the odds
of hosting a party here?

29:25.810 --> 29:27.600
- It might actually be
a little bit difficult.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.180
Apparently their neighbor
is a pain in the ass.

29:31.180 --> 29:32.013
- [Loren] Why don't we just find

29:32.013 --> 29:32.910
somewhere else down the beach?

29:32.910 --> 29:34.570
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:34.570 --> 29:38.250
We said we're gonna throw
the best beach party ever,

29:38.250 --> 29:39.720
and we're gonna do it.

29:39.720 --> 29:40.620
- What about Dusty?

29:40.620 --> 29:41.770
She seems to hold the key as to

29:41.770 --> 29:43.160
whether or not we can have the party here.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.380
- Don't worry about her.

29:44.380 --> 29:45.930
I think I can get her on board.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.120
- [Loren] I do know that
Cory's all on board.

29:49.120 --> 29:49.953
- That's good.

29:51.380 --> 29:52.290
We just gotta figure out what we're

29:52.290 --> 29:54.210
gonna do about this Brigitte chick.

29:55.630 --> 29:57.680
- [Loren] What if we just go talk to her?

30:00.930 --> 30:02.192
- Smart.

30:02.192 --> 30:04.844
Then we'll know who we're dealing with.

30:04.844 --> 30:08.365
Alright.

30:08.365 --> 30:10.948
(upbeat music)

30:27.450 --> 30:31.100
- I didn't realize it would
be that hard of a decision.

30:31.100 --> 30:33.340
- It is a very important decision.

30:38.081 --> 30:40.131
Nah, the first one never quite works out.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.430
That's why so many.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.210
You should really try some on.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.530
- I don't know, I'm just not in the mood.

30:49.530 --> 30:51.040
- Why, what's the matter?

30:51.910 --> 30:53.740
- Well, this whole weekend is not

30:53.740 --> 30:55.690
working out the way I thought it would.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.330
- It really was kind
of a stressful morning.

31:01.330 --> 31:02.800
- [Dusty] Between Loren and Stacy,

31:02.800 --> 31:04.260
Auntie Brinke isn't much help,

31:04.260 --> 31:06.710
and then this Brad and Tad guys come by.

31:07.850 --> 31:09.190
- Really, who are they?

31:10.680 --> 31:12.590
- [Dusty] Just a couple
of frat jocks that were

31:12.590 --> 31:14.440
in the running for the condo as well.

31:17.530 --> 31:20.670
- [Cory] Nah, maybe my
freshman or sophomore year.

31:21.710 --> 31:24.500
- [Dusty] They seemed like
a couple of real idiots.

31:26.890 --> 31:27.723
- You know what?

31:27.723 --> 31:29.220
I really think you should try this on.

31:30.580 --> 31:32.570
Trust me, it'll make you feel better.

31:33.860 --> 31:34.693
- Whatever.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.520
- I think the last semester of college

31:41.520 --> 31:43.570
really got the good of you.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.920
I mean, all these clinical classes

31:45.920 --> 31:48.150
and the extra classes kicked your ass.

31:49.420 --> 31:52.630
- Well, I'm just glad
it's over and what I want

31:52.630 --> 31:55.870
is just a quiet nice weekend
away from everything.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.690
- Well, it is definitely
away from everything.

32:00.690 --> 32:02.980
But I don't think it should be quiet.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.700
And I don't think you
feel it should be either.

32:07.990 --> 32:08.850
- I don't know.

32:10.950 --> 32:12.430
- Well, it's a start.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.170
But again, never the first one.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.480
Here, try this.

32:24.780 --> 32:27.703
There we go, the first
cracks are starting to show.

32:27.703 --> 32:30.140
(laughing)

32:30.140 --> 32:33.090
So what do you think
about Loren and Stacy?

32:34.410 --> 32:36.980
- Well I guess they're good guys.

32:36.980 --> 32:39.525
I talked to Stacy this morning.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.000
- Really, what did he
say about this morning?

32:42.000 --> 32:45.940
- Well we had mutual
apologies and understandings.

32:47.020 --> 32:47.853
How 'bout you?

32:50.720 --> 32:52.570
- Loren came in to apologize.

32:52.570 --> 32:53.710
He's such a cutie.

32:55.130 --> 32:57.220
- Ooh, I know what that means.

32:58.490 --> 33:01.610
- [Cory] Hmm, this one
goes to the maybe pile.

33:01.610 --> 33:02.760
- [Dusty] Getting closer.

33:02.760 --> 33:05.650
- Mhmm, so are we going to participate

33:05.650 --> 33:07.100
on the beach parties tonight?

33:08.470 --> 33:11.460
- Look, it's not going to be able to work.

33:11.460 --> 33:13.020
We can't risk getting into trouble

33:13.020 --> 33:15.170
by the bitchy Brigitte
and the association.

33:16.526 --> 33:20.650
- So what you are saying is
that we need to get rid of her.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.590
- In a sense, yes.

33:23.590 --> 33:25.630
At least, we have to get her

33:25.630 --> 33:27.440
to go along with us having a party.

33:29.100 --> 33:29.933
- Hmm.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.530
- At least we have plenty of other parties

33:35.530 --> 33:37.300
to go even if we can't host one.

33:38.390 --> 33:41.050
- Well, I'm not really giving up hope

33:42.550 --> 33:45.070
because I kinda invited some people over.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.080
- What?

33:47.080 --> 33:49.260
- Um, I may have mentioned to Steph

33:49.260 --> 33:51.750
and Becky that we're hosting a party.

33:51.750 --> 33:52.583
- You did?

33:53.726 --> 33:55.050
- Yeah.

33:55.050 --> 33:57.170
- They are going to invite everybody!

33:58.190 --> 33:59.690
- Probably.

33:59.690 --> 34:02.340
- Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.173
What are we gonna do?

34:03.173 --> 34:04.714
What am I gonna do?

34:04.714 --> 34:06.625
We're going to get into so much trouble.

34:06.625 --> 34:09.969
Auntie Brinke's not going
to have her condo intact.

34:09.969 --> 34:10.969
It's going to be ruined by us.

34:10.969 --> 34:12.370
- Okay, okay, okay.

34:12.370 --> 34:13.460
Calm down.

34:13.460 --> 34:14.293
It'll be okay.

34:15.650 --> 34:17.150
- [Dusty] How can you say that?

34:17.150 --> 34:20.139
- Because anybody who can rock this

34:20.139 --> 34:22.480
swimsuit like you do can do anything.

34:33.260 --> 34:34.092
Mhmm.

34:35.830 --> 34:37.070
Um, looks perfect.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.203
- You know what?

34:42.350 --> 34:47.350
We're going to host the best
Horndog Beach Party tonight.

34:48.940 --> 34:50.010
- Yes!

34:50.010 --> 34:51.139
Oh my God, I'm so happy.

34:51.139 --> 34:52.810
- We have a lot to do.

34:52.810 --> 34:53.643
- Yeah.

35:04.432 --> 35:06.250
- Did you pick your suit yet?

35:06.250 --> 35:11.060
- Um, mhmm, yep.

35:12.430 --> 35:13.780
- Isn't that the first on?

35:13.780 --> 35:15.260
- Yeah, so?

35:15.260 --> 35:17.350
Let's go, we have a lot of work to do.

35:31.510 --> 35:35.960
- Okay, so let me get this straight.

35:37.420 --> 35:40.790
You want to invite a few friends over

35:40.790 --> 35:44.210
and have a party on my beach.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.790
- On the beach that we share.

35:45.790 --> 35:50.000
- You want to have a giant sin party

35:50.000 --> 35:53.600
with drinking and drugs and fornications--

35:53.600 --> 35:56.020
- I wouldn't that far.

35:56.020 --> 36:00.440
- And get your fornication
juices all over my beach?

36:01.450 --> 36:02.800
I think not!

36:04.060 --> 36:09.060
And I am warning you, I will
be watching and taking notes.

36:11.760 --> 36:15.740
So you go back to your weekend condo

36:16.790 --> 36:21.580
and get some sun, maybe
splash in the water a little,

36:22.440 --> 36:26.240
but you will not be having
a party on my beach!

36:27.140 --> 36:28.040
Do you understand?

36:29.594 --> 36:30.427
- Uh.

36:30.427 --> 36:31.260
- Good day.

36:36.100 --> 36:38.730
(seagulls crying)

36:38.730 --> 36:39.563
- Any ideas?

36:39.563 --> 36:41.757
- I'm sure we'll figure something out.

36:41.757 --> 36:43.960
(playful music)

36:43.960 --> 36:45.680
- What the hell?

36:45.680 --> 36:47.260
- Bro, you got him so good!

36:47.260 --> 36:49.040
- Good throw yourself, dude.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.250
- [Stacy] Seriously, what
the hell is that about?

36:51.250 --> 36:53.320
- That's for taking our
room for the weekend.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.510
- Yeah, you totally snaked our room

36:54.510 --> 36:55.920
pretending to be girls!

36:55.920 --> 36:58.390
- [Stacy] We didn't pretend anything!

36:58.390 --> 37:00.150
- Whoa, you just stop right there.

37:00.150 --> 37:02.420
- Hey, we applied just like everyone else.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.240
It's not our fault they
mixed up the names.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.073
- Yeah?

37:05.073 --> 37:06.260
Well because of you, we don't have the

37:06.260 --> 37:08.280
best spot on the beach to host a party.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.113
- Yeah, you tell 'em, bro.

37:09.113 --> 37:11.620
- We're not going to be
able to have a party either.

37:11.620 --> 37:14.020
- Yeah, because we're
gonna make sure you don't.

37:15.850 --> 37:18.280
- [Stacy] Whatever, screw you guys.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.800
Let's go.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.950
- Yeah, you go on and hide!

37:21.950 --> 37:23.260
- Yeah, you tell 'em, bro!

37:31.100 --> 37:32.670
- You okay dude?

37:32.670 --> 37:34.262
- Uh, yeah bro.

37:34.262 --> 37:36.733
I just think I saw something
awesome over there.

37:44.820 --> 37:45.769
- Hey.

37:45.769 --> 37:47.250
- Hey, what's the matter with you guys?

37:48.540 --> 37:50.190
- I'm starting to think having a party

37:50.190 --> 37:52.360
isn't really in the cards anymore.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.340
- What makes you say that?

37:54.340 --> 37:56.390
- We tried to talk to Brigitte next door.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.530
- Ooh, it didn't go well, did it?

38:01.040 --> 38:03.290
- And a couple of jerks
started throwing water balloons

38:03.290 --> 38:05.880
at us and said it was
for taking their room.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.080
- And we're not going
to have a party anymore.

38:08.080 --> 38:08.913
- [Cory] What?

38:09.870 --> 38:12.260
- Were they a couple frat looking boys

38:12.260 --> 38:15.390
that kept saying brah and bro a lot?

38:16.970 --> 38:17.970
- Yeah.

38:17.970 --> 38:19.910
- [Dusty] Hmm, sounds like Brad and Tad.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.200
- Those guys are a couple
of real douches, by the way.

38:25.870 --> 38:28.670
- Well, it's time to
start thinking positive.

38:28.670 --> 38:29.503
- Oh really?

38:30.480 --> 38:34.000
- Yes, because we are going
to have us a beach party here!

38:34.000 --> 38:35.500
- Are you serious?

38:36.416 --> 38:37.249
- Yes.

38:37.249 --> 38:39.370
- So what brought this about?

38:39.370 --> 38:41.370
- Well, maybe you were a bit right earlier

38:41.370 --> 38:43.350
that you guys came here for a party

38:43.350 --> 38:46.370
and it took me a while to
realize that I did too.

38:46.370 --> 38:47.530
- Mhmm, alright.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.370
- That's awesome!

38:51.190 --> 38:53.980
So what do we have to do to get ready?

38:53.980 --> 38:57.710
- Oh, and what are we gonna
do about your neighbor?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.390
- I'm not sure about her yet,

38:59.390 --> 39:01.490
but I know the first thing we need to do

39:01.490 --> 39:04.460
is to find everything we need to decorate.

39:04.460 --> 39:08.120
- Yes, because we need balloons, booze,

39:08.120 --> 39:11.500
tiki torches, booze, hats, booze.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.470
Oh wait, I forgot something.

39:13.470 --> 39:14.470
Did I mention booze?

39:16.570 --> 39:19.560
- Uh, I suppose I better go get my wallet.

39:20.930 --> 39:23.060
- Um, is he alright?

39:24.430 --> 39:25.540
- Yeah, uh.

39:26.490 --> 39:29.770
He actually just got out of a
really serious relationship.

39:29.770 --> 39:30.603
Three years.

39:31.870 --> 39:32.770
They were engaged.

39:34.430 --> 39:37.120
Turns out at the end of our fall semester,

39:37.120 --> 39:40.790
he found out that she was
cheating on him for the last year.

39:40.790 --> 39:43.720
- Oh wow, that is so sad
she would do that to him.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.650
- Yeah, he took it really hard.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.874
Almost dropped out of school.

39:48.874 --> 39:49.707
- That poor guy.

39:50.861 --> 39:51.970
- Yeah.

39:51.970 --> 39:53.470
It's actually pretty amazing he's

39:53.470 --> 39:55.360
even on this trip in the first place.

39:56.700 --> 39:59.510
He might kinda put up a
little bit of a front,

39:59.510 --> 40:01.520
so if it seems like he's acting

40:01.520 --> 40:04.250
a little bit off, that's why.

40:04.250 --> 40:06.522
- He's such a sweetie, though.

40:06.522 --> 40:08.070
- Yeah.

40:08.070 --> 40:12.070
- Hey, if you can, try to take
it easy on him a little bit.

40:12.070 --> 40:13.730
Don't rush him into anything.

40:14.830 --> 40:15.663
- Okay.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.110
- Okay, ready to go.

40:18.110 --> 40:18.943
- Alright, nice.

40:18.943 --> 40:19.776
Yeah, we can just--

40:19.776 --> 40:21.390
- Hey, wait, Loren.

40:21.390 --> 40:23.940
You're going with me to the party store.

40:23.940 --> 40:25.860
- Oh, uh sure.

40:25.860 --> 40:28.060
- [Cory] Can I have your keys?

40:28.060 --> 40:28.893
Awesome.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.757
- Don't worry, she will
take great care of him.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.380
- Look at them.

40:39.380 --> 40:41.410
They're not even trying to hide it.

40:43.490 --> 40:44.337
- Oh my, ooh!

40:45.620 --> 40:47.430
Oh my God!

40:47.430 --> 40:48.350
- Oh!
- Oh!

40:48.350 --> 40:49.284
- Are you okay?

40:49.284 --> 40:50.550
(laughing)

40:50.550 --> 40:52.790
- Nerds!
- Nerds!

40:52.790 --> 40:54.510
- What is this?

40:54.510 --> 40:55.343
- Seriously?

40:55.343 --> 40:56.550
Chocolate milk?

40:56.550 --> 40:57.383
You goobers!

40:58.510 --> 41:01.110
- Oh, don't worry, it does the body good.

41:01.110 --> 41:01.943
Right, dude?

41:01.943 --> 41:02.776
- Oh, yeah, brah!

41:04.970 --> 41:07.300
- Oh yes, this is good stuff.

41:11.901 --> 41:13.610
- This is not funny.

41:13.610 --> 41:14.443
- [Cory] No, it's not!

41:14.443 --> 41:15.720
- [Tad] I think it's kinda funny.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.070
What about you, brah?

41:17.070 --> 41:17.970
- Oh, let me look.

41:19.761 --> 41:21.379
(laughing)

41:21.379 --> 41:22.679
I think it's even funnier!

41:24.850 --> 41:25.683
- Let's go.

41:25.683 --> 41:26.516
- Yeah.

41:29.800 --> 41:30.633
Seriously?

41:32.090 --> 41:33.530
(laughing)

41:33.530 --> 41:34.800
- [Thad] This never gets old.

41:34.800 --> 41:35.633
- Yeah, bro.

41:42.040 --> 41:45.080
- Ooh, whoa, what happened?

41:46.550 --> 41:47.910
- Brad and Tad.

41:47.910 --> 41:49.060
- That's what happened.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.110
- What is it with those guys?

41:52.110 --> 41:54.990
- I don't know, but I know
what we need to finish it.

41:56.570 --> 41:57.830
- What?

41:57.830 --> 41:58.800
- Cory.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.940
- Yes?

41:59.940 --> 42:02.140
- What time are Steph
and Becky coming over?

42:02.980 --> 42:04.950
- I told them around three.

42:04.950 --> 42:07.290
- Give them a call and
tell them the party's on

42:07.290 --> 42:09.070
and we need their help for a special

42:09.070 --> 42:10.760
situation as soon as possible.

42:11.790 --> 42:14.340
- Alright, I'm going to
give them a call right now.

42:15.930 --> 42:17.241
- Hey Cory?

42:17.241 --> 42:18.154
- Yes?

42:18.154 --> 42:19.920
- You can shower first if you'd like.

42:19.920 --> 42:20.753
- Thank you.

42:22.110 --> 42:22.943
- Please do.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.720
So what are we gonna do?

42:29.810 --> 42:31.680
- You know we have to get some supplies.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.870
- Right, but what about Brad and Tad?

42:34.800 --> 42:35.633
- Hmm.

42:36.677 --> 42:38.927
We're going to have to
get some distractions.

42:40.830 --> 42:41.663
- What?

42:42.670 --> 42:45.310
- Sorry man, you're going to
have to take one for the team.

42:45.310 --> 42:46.580
- You just want me to go out there unarmed

42:46.580 --> 42:48.060
and just run around taking it?

42:48.060 --> 42:49.610
- Pretty much, but not unarmed.

43:03.544 --> 43:04.970
- How'd it go, bro?

43:04.970 --> 43:06.520
- It looks awesome, dude.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.900
- Oh, nice!

43:07.900 --> 43:10.160
- What the hell is that joker doing?

43:11.330 --> 43:12.606
- Hey guys.

43:12.606 --> 43:15.273
(playful music)

43:19.336 --> 43:20.690
- What the?

43:20.690 --> 43:21.812
- Oh, dude, gross.

43:21.812 --> 43:24.112
- It smells like, it
smells like pickle juice.

43:25.848 --> 43:26.681
- Oh.

43:26.681 --> 43:28.020
- [Loren] Screw you guys.

43:28.020 --> 43:28.853
- Oh!

43:28.853 --> 43:29.686
- Oh, Jesus!

43:31.410 --> 43:32.390
- Oh, poor boys.

43:35.566 --> 43:37.520
- [Dusty] Oh, look at him go.

43:37.520 --> 43:38.720
Will he be alright?

43:38.720 --> 43:40.240
- Oh, yeah, he'll be fine.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.520
He was all-college track and field.

43:43.574 --> 43:44.580
He ran the 1600.

43:45.560 --> 43:46.810
- [Dusty] Nice.

43:51.110 --> 43:53.640
- [Stacy] Looks like the coast is clear.

43:56.140 --> 43:59.920
- Oh, that is so wrong.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.450
- Maybe a car wash first?

44:09.310 --> 44:11.970
- Guys, I got a hold of Becky and Steph

44:11.970 --> 44:13.360
and they'll be here in like...

44:14.350 --> 44:15.183
Hello?

44:16.950 --> 44:18.050
Where did they all go?

45:17.864 --> 45:18.811
- Hello?

45:18.811 --> 45:19.710
(gasping)

45:19.710 --> 45:22.250
Oh, I'm so sorry.

45:24.430 --> 45:25.580
- [Cory] Uh, it's okay.

45:27.830 --> 45:29.330
- The other two went to go get supplies.

45:29.330 --> 45:32.220
I tried knocking to let
you know what was going on.

45:32.220 --> 45:34.300
- [Cory] Thanks for letting me know.

45:34.300 --> 45:35.133
- Okay then.

45:35.133 --> 45:37.430
Um, I'll just have to take
a shower when you're done.

45:37.430 --> 45:38.600
- [Cory] Okay.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.000
Loren?

45:40.000 --> 45:40.833
- [Loren] Yeah?

45:40.833 --> 45:41.730
- [Cory] Can you please hand me

45:41.730 --> 45:43.360
the shampoo bottle on the counter?

45:43.360 --> 45:45.540
- [Loren] Uh, sure.

45:47.230 --> 45:49.110
- [Cory] Just hand it through the curtain.

45:50.410 --> 45:51.243
- [Loren] Oh!

45:52.760 --> 45:56.000
- Well, now it's time to
get you all cleaned up.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.710
- Uh, I, uh, I haven't been--

46:00.830 --> 46:02.350
- There, how was that?

46:03.811 --> 46:05.869
- That was really good.

46:05.869 --> 46:08.452
(upbeat music)

46:18.192 --> 46:20.775
(upbeat music)

47:10.190 --> 47:13.051
- Gettin' a bit of a late start, ain't ya?

47:13.051 --> 47:16.222
- Oh, you know, it's a bit
of a last minute addition.

47:16.222 --> 47:19.580
- But how is the weekend
a last minute decision.

47:21.187 --> 47:22.070
- Well, I don't know.

47:22.070 --> 47:23.930
It just turned out that way.

47:23.930 --> 47:26.190
- But better late than never, right?

47:26.190 --> 47:28.160
- Heh, party on, man.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.600
So where ya hosting at?

47:32.600 --> 47:33.850
- My Aunt Brinke's condo.

47:34.910 --> 47:37.670
- Oh, the one with the little beach point.

47:37.670 --> 47:39.180
- Yeah, that's it.

47:39.180 --> 47:40.080
You been there?

47:40.080 --> 47:43.220
- Oh yeah, Brinke and I go way back.

47:43.220 --> 47:44.350
- Oh, very cool.

47:44.350 --> 47:45.790
So it's a nice area?

47:45.790 --> 47:46.800
- Oh, it's the best.

47:49.090 --> 47:49.923
- Sweet.

47:51.490 --> 47:53.710
- [Clerk] She still got
that crazy ass neighbor?

47:53.710 --> 47:55.820
- Yes, unfortunately.

47:55.820 --> 47:57.370
- Ah, it's too bad.

47:57.370 --> 47:59.360
She's a real ball buster.

47:59.360 --> 48:01.260
- Wonder what her problem is?

48:01.260 --> 48:03.700
- Oh, like 15 years ago she was datin'

48:03.700 --> 48:06.180
this college frat boy type.

48:06.180 --> 48:07.430
He left.

48:07.430 --> 48:09.210
She ain't never been the same since.

48:12.150 --> 48:13.810
Yeah, she was a real cougar.

48:14.870 --> 48:17.000
I even tried to get with her,

48:17.000 --> 48:18.450
but I guess I'm not her type.

48:19.340 --> 48:20.940
Whatever.

48:20.940 --> 48:23.050
She couldn't land anybody after that.

48:23.050 --> 48:24.920
Not that year, not the year after.

48:25.760 --> 48:29.000
Then she got this whole moral
authority bug up her ass,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.010
and well, never been the same since.

48:31.010 --> 48:31.843
- Wait a second.

48:32.700 --> 48:35.230
You're tellin' me if we
can just get her laid

48:35.230 --> 48:37.880
by some college frat jock?

48:38.825 --> 48:41.250
- (laughing) Bow-chica-bow-bow!

48:41.250 --> 48:42.160
Right on, dude.

48:43.631 --> 48:45.400
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

48:45.400 --> 48:48.990
- Oh, I think so.

48:48.990 --> 48:50.930
- Alright, that is 11.95.

48:57.170 --> 48:58.460
- There, keep it.

48:59.450 --> 49:00.520
- Whoa, seriously?

49:00.520 --> 49:01.410
- Yeah.

49:01.410 --> 49:04.420
- You told us exactly
what we needed to hear.

49:04.420 --> 49:05.860
- Awesome.

49:05.860 --> 49:06.790
- Thanks.

49:06.790 --> 49:09.462
Hey, come on out tonight.

49:09.462 --> 49:10.597
- Alright, man.

49:10.597 --> 49:12.377
Boom, I'll be there.
- See you tonight.

49:12.377 --> 49:13.864
- Alright.

49:13.864 --> 49:17.714
- Yeah, party down.

49:17.714 --> 49:20.964
(rhythmic eerie music)

49:33.196 --> 49:35.696
(eerie music)

49:37.164 --> 49:38.450
- You know what?

49:38.450 --> 49:41.520
I think I was too hard on this film.

49:42.360 --> 49:47.200
I think it has transcended
being a mere motion picture

49:47.200 --> 49:50.590
and has emerged from it's celluloid cocoon

49:50.590 --> 49:54.870
as a full on sadomasochistic
social experiment.

49:55.740 --> 49:57.610
- [Announcer] What are you on about?

49:57.610 --> 49:58.810
- No, hear me out.

49:58.810 --> 50:00.920
I'm not even doing a bit.

50:00.920 --> 50:03.460
What kind of sex comedy would

50:03.460 --> 50:06.090
provide so precious little sex?

50:06.940 --> 50:09.270
There is more shopping than anything,

50:09.270 --> 50:12.560
and more talking than
My Dinner With Andre,

50:12.560 --> 50:17.560
and to finish it off, a
fully clothed shower scene.

50:18.660 --> 50:21.600
And as for sex, not a single thrust.

50:22.480 --> 50:25.150
Well played, Horndog's, well played.

50:25.150 --> 50:28.320
You have tortured my subjects to levels

50:28.320 --> 50:31.920
of submission that I could only imagine.

50:32.920 --> 50:36.040
- [Announcer] I have to
admit, you aren't wrong.

50:36.040 --> 50:36.910
- Am I ever?

50:36.910 --> 50:37.743
- [Announcer] Remember when you

50:37.743 --> 50:39.950
opened that strip club for cats?

50:40.930 --> 50:42.090
Cat Nips?

50:42.090 --> 50:43.450
- That was genius idea.

50:43.450 --> 50:46.510
Cat sexuality is untapped goldmine.

50:46.510 --> 50:47.700
- [Announcer] It devolved into a hissing,

50:47.700 --> 50:49.400
spraying hell within seconds.

50:49.400 --> 50:51.880
- So it had a few kinks.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.900
And who amongst us here doesn't?

50:56.400 --> 50:59.410
Anyway, this movie has subjected

50:59.410 --> 51:04.410
one and all to unholy levels of torture.

51:04.900 --> 51:06.530
I believe we are done here.

51:06.530 --> 51:09.260
- [Announcer] You are aware
the film isn't over, right?

51:09.260 --> 51:10.093
- Really?

51:10.093 --> 51:12.050
- [Announcer] No, we
haven't even seen that

51:12.050 --> 51:14.350
party that they've
talked about incessantly.

51:14.350 --> 51:16.980
- I just assumed this was plot hole.

51:16.980 --> 51:17.980
- [Announcer] Plot hole?

51:17.980 --> 51:19.730
It's the entire point of the story.

51:20.690 --> 51:23.020
- Have you seen the rest of the movie?

51:24.490 --> 51:26.690
I would not be surprised
if the film makers

51:26.690 --> 51:28.700
just forgot to finish it.

51:28.700 --> 51:29.680
- [Announcer] Another good point.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.440
You know, you're on fire today.

51:42.780 --> 51:45.190
- Oh, speaking of fire.

51:45.190 --> 51:47.780
I have been advised that the following

51:47.780 --> 51:51.790
reel of tonight's film may
cause burning sensation

51:51.790 --> 51:56.710
in the eyes and loss of
sensation in the genitalia.

51:56.710 --> 52:00.410
These symptoms should persist
for only two to four days,

52:00.410 --> 52:03.390
but if they continue
then you should contact

52:03.390 --> 52:07.590
your primary care physician
or call 1-800-CROTCH-ROT.

52:10.770 --> 52:11.980
Anyway, enough of that.

52:13.150 --> 52:14.760
Here goes nothing.

52:14.760 --> 52:15.720
Roll 'em, boys!

52:16.990 --> 52:20.680
You know, I think this
movie is the worst thing

52:20.680 --> 52:25.680
that has ever happened to me,
and I grew up in Chernobyl.

52:25.827 --> 52:27.378
(static crackling)

52:27.378 --> 52:28.818
(upbeat music)

52:28.818 --> 52:31.401
(Cory moaning)

52:48.399 --> 52:51.849
(playful music)

52:51.849 --> 52:53.266
- [Cory] Oh yeah.

52:55.846 --> 52:57.860
- That was amazing.

52:57.860 --> 52:58.810
- You were awesome.

53:00.899 --> 53:02.940
- I've been needing that so bad.

53:02.940 --> 53:04.240
- You're such a sweet guy.

53:05.180 --> 53:07.440
- When are your friends gonna be here?

53:07.440 --> 53:08.540
- Um, in a little bit.

53:09.660 --> 53:11.900
- Maybe you should get dressed?

53:11.900 --> 53:13.850
- No, there's no rush.

53:18.955 --> 53:21.340
- (whistling) Hey, you
girls need some waterin'?

53:21.340 --> 53:22.173
Hey!

53:24.294 --> 53:26.280
- This is gonna be the best one yet, dude.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.113
- Oh yeah, bro.

53:27.113 --> 53:29.276
They are totally gonna have
to leave after this one.

53:29.276 --> 53:31.418
- Totally, dude.

53:31.418 --> 53:33.345
(playful music)

53:33.345 --> 53:35.595
(grunting)

53:38.204 --> 53:39.037
- Jesus.

53:40.057 --> 53:42.233
(grunting)

53:42.233 --> 53:44.300
- Dude, what are they doing to you?

53:44.300 --> 53:47.891
- Oh my God, make it stop, make it stop!

53:47.891 --> 53:50.930
- We've been told that you two
have been causing problems.

53:50.930 --> 53:53.553
- We're sorry, we're so sorry, bro.

53:53.553 --> 53:54.386
- Dude, really?

53:54.386 --> 53:57.300
- Now, are you two gonna
apologize to the others?

53:57.300 --> 53:59.280
- Yes, yes, I promise I will.

54:00.190 --> 54:01.023
- Ew!

54:03.930 --> 54:04.763
Ew!

54:06.791 --> 54:08.595
- What, what is it?

54:08.595 --> 54:12.066
- [Becky] Do you smell pickles?

54:12.066 --> 54:17.066
- Yeah.

54:17.827 --> 54:19.990
- Oh now, what do we have here?

54:21.140 --> 54:23.100
A few more whores.

54:24.780 --> 54:28.070
- [Becky] Alright you
two, front door, now!

54:28.070 --> 54:28.903
- But...

54:28.903 --> 54:29.736
- [Steph] Now!

54:29.736 --> 54:30.569
- Yes, ma'am.

54:32.306 --> 54:35.223
(knocking on door)

54:36.890 --> 54:37.740
- [Steph] Get in!

54:40.500 --> 54:43.270
- Steph, hey!
- Hey!

54:43.270 --> 54:44.490
- Hi!
- Hey!

54:44.490 --> 54:46.665
- Brah, I'm sorry, brah.

54:46.665 --> 54:48.180
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

54:48.180 --> 54:49.210
- Well.

54:49.210 --> 54:50.080
- Where's your bathroom, bro?

54:50.080 --> 54:51.670
Please, brah?

54:51.670 --> 54:53.517
- Uh, right over there.

54:53.517 --> 54:58.517
- Thanks, brah.

54:58.832 --> 55:01.082
(grunting)

55:02.035 --> 55:07.035
(flatulence and splashing)
(groaning)

55:16.732 --> 55:17.565
Oh God.

55:19.004 --> 55:21.171
- Dude, that's just nasty.

55:22.560 --> 55:23.393
Sorry, dude.

55:30.170 --> 55:31.330
- Loren, come here.

55:32.940 --> 55:35.960
So, Loren, this is Steph and Becky.

55:37.426 --> 55:38.259
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:41.080 --> 55:42.620
- Cute.
- Yeah.

55:42.620 --> 55:43.660
- He is a cutie.

55:44.620 --> 55:47.090
- Yeah, he really is,
and he's such a sweetie,

55:47.090 --> 55:49.937
and I mean he really is a sweetie.

55:56.270 --> 55:58.066
- Hey girl!

55:58.066 --> 55:58.899
- Nice to see you two!

56:02.561 --> 56:03.394
- Hey!

56:04.732 --> 56:06.280
- You guys need some help?

56:06.280 --> 56:07.113
- Yeah, absolutely.

56:07.113 --> 56:07.946
Here, grab some

56:07.946 --> 56:08.779
- Did you guys get booze?

56:08.779 --> 56:09.612
- Duh!

56:10.633 --> 56:11.820
- Alright, that's what I'm talkin' about!

56:13.528 --> 56:14.969
- It's in the back.

56:14.969 --> 56:15.869
- Hey, can I help?

56:18.710 --> 56:19.543
- It's cool.

56:20.704 --> 56:23.060
- Uh, well alrighty then!

56:23.060 --> 56:24.210
- Alright.
- Let's go.

56:25.850 --> 56:27.860
- Did you wash your car window off?

56:36.220 --> 56:37.053
- [Steph] There.

56:38.727 --> 56:40.790
- I think we have everything we need.

56:40.790 --> 56:43.900
- Everything except your
neighbor's permission.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.950
- That'll never happen.

56:45.950 --> 56:47.650
- Uh, not necessarily.

56:48.630 --> 56:49.750
- What do you mean?

56:49.750 --> 56:53.020
- Hmm, I think she has a
weakness for the young guys.

56:54.460 --> 56:57.070
- Well, she didn't seem to like us at all.

56:57.070 --> 56:58.400
- Apparently we're not her type.

56:59.740 --> 57:02.138
- [Brad] Well what is her type, dude?

57:02.138 --> 57:04.106
- You guys, dude.

57:04.106 --> 57:07.208
I think the other one.

57:07.208 --> 57:10.791
(flatulence and splashing)

57:16.733 --> 57:19.566
(toilet flushing)

57:25.504 --> 57:27.725
- Bro, I'm really sorry about earlier.

57:27.725 --> 57:28.558
- Oh man.

57:28.558 --> 57:29.410
- We were acting like assholes.

57:29.410 --> 57:30.270
- It's cool, man.

57:30.270 --> 57:31.690
We're cool.

57:31.690 --> 57:32.840
- You okay, dude?

57:32.840 --> 57:33.673
- Oh yeah, brah.

57:33.673 --> 57:35.360
Actually, I feel pretty refreshed.

57:36.310 --> 57:40.340
- Hey, any of you two guys
into cougars by chance?

57:40.340 --> 57:41.340
- Not me, dude.

57:41.340 --> 57:43.160
I'm into 19 to 25 only.

57:48.480 --> 57:49.790
- Well, I know I am!

57:49.790 --> 57:51.400
I'm totally into cougars, man.

57:51.400 --> 57:52.430
That's totally my bag, man.

57:52.430 --> 57:53.740
Why, you got something in mind?

57:54.940 --> 57:56.340
- Bitchy Brigitte next door.

57:57.256 --> 57:58.089
- Yes.

57:58.089 --> 57:59.310
- Oh, see, I told you.

57:59.310 --> 58:00.970
I knew something awesome
was happening next door!

58:00.970 --> 58:02.640
Hot cougar on the prowl, brah!

58:05.080 --> 58:06.100
- To each his own.

58:07.480 --> 58:10.420
- Well, it's been a while
for this one, I think,

58:10.420 --> 58:12.620
and this cougar is hungry.

58:12.620 --> 58:14.510
- Oh no, even better, brah.

58:14.510 --> 58:16.870
- Well, if you really wanna party tonight,

58:16.870 --> 58:18.250
you better get over there.

58:22.890 --> 58:25.380
- Oh wow, this is good stuff.

58:30.070 --> 58:33.270
Oh my, well hello.

58:33.270 --> 58:34.120
- Hello yourself.

58:35.591 --> 58:37.641
- Would you like to come in for some tea?

58:38.930 --> 58:39.763
- Yes, I would.

58:42.177 --> 58:43.470
- Do you smell pickles?

58:45.060 --> 58:48.530
- Um, I love pickle, don't you?

58:48.530 --> 58:50.890
- Yes, so do I.

58:56.370 --> 58:58.110
- He's in!

58:58.110 --> 58:59.160
- Okay, we've got a lot to do.

- Now all we have to do is
wait for her permission.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.690
- It's already 5:15.

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:29.950
- The Horndog Beach Party
starts in less than two hours!

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:31.540
- Don't worry, it will work.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.170
In the meantime, would you
like to see my swimsuit?

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:37.493
- Heck yeah.

01:01:38.342 --> 01:01:39.470
- Let's go.

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:40.940
- I got a new one, too.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.530
- I can't wait to see it.

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:44.676
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:44.676 --> 01:01:48.220
Yes, here's my swimsuit.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.070
- Oh, that?

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:51.580
I thought you were gonna
put it on or something?

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:56.420
- Well, don't you think it
looks great as it is right now.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.288
- I mean, it's cute, but
I wanna see it on you!

01:01:59.288 --> 01:02:00.288
- Of course.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.070
- [Stacy] Oh my gosh, what a tease.

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:08.170
- Hey, I need to change.

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.480
Get out.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.410
- [Stacy] Really?

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.243
- Yeah.

01:02:11.243 --> 01:02:12.076
- Already?

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:12.909
- Get out.
- Really?

01:02:12.909 --> 01:02:13.742
- Yeah, get out.
- Dude, what?

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.173
- Well?

01:02:18.173 --> 01:02:20.220
- Don't you need to?

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.400
- No.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.000
- You can see it later, come on.

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:33.080
- You know, you're not
such a bad guy after all.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.727
- Sometimes things just
get the better of me.

01:02:37.727 --> 01:02:39.653
- Get the better of us all.

01:02:39.653 --> 01:02:44.117
- Ooh, but good things
come to those who repent.

01:02:44.117 --> 01:02:45.036
- Oh yeah?

01:02:45.036 --> 01:02:49.810
- And you repent very well.

01:02:57.064 --> 01:03:00.920
- Dude, I don't know how
Tad's gonna pull that off.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.160
Brigitte really is a bitch, dude.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.760
Bitchy Brigitte, I have no idea.

01:03:05.932 --> 01:03:06.765
- I hope he does.

01:03:06.765 --> 01:03:08.510
We really need to have this party.

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:10.840
What do you think, uh, what do you

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.310
think's gonna happen if he doesn't?

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:14.950
Can we still have the party?
- If he doesn't?

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:20.680
We have to have this party.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.270
He has got to bang that out, now.

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:25.320
Or I don't know what else we're gonna do.

01:03:26.768 --> 01:03:28.690
You think she'd call the cops on us?

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:29.790
- She has in the past.

01:03:32.831 --> 01:03:33.664
Yeah.

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:38.603
I'm hoping he does.

01:03:38.603 --> 01:03:40.030
I mean, this party, we've been planning

01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:41.550
on coming here for a long time.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:42.730
The girls are down.

01:03:44.239 --> 01:03:45.072
What do you think's gonna happen?

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:47.080
- [Stacy] We can't not have this party,

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.030
so hopefully he just bangs her out,

01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:51.590
comes back over here, and we're set.

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:53.500
I don't know what we're gonna do

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.410
if we can't get her on board.

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:57.330
- You actually think he's
gonna be able to do it.

01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:58.163
- I hope so.

01:03:58.163 --> 01:03:59.750
I mean, I don't know.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:01.520
Cougars are crazy, dude.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.750
I don't know.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:11.100
If it doesn't work out, I'm
still gonna have a party.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.900
I don't know what everyone
else is gonna be doing.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:14.900
- [Loren] Yeah, man.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.090
- Want something to drink.

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:19.640
- [Loren] Yeah, I need a drink.

01:04:21.151 --> 01:04:24.121
(doorbell ringing)

01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:27.173
- Oh, wow, what a fantastic swimsuit!

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.770
I just wanted to apologize for

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:32.530
the way I've been acting lately.

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:35.570
It hasn't been very lady-like.

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.130
- [Dusty] It's okay.

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.980
- Well, the reason why I'm here is

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.950
I heard that there's a beach
festival going on tonight

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:49.210
and my new beau and I wanted to see

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:51.280
if you wanted to host a beach party?

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.580
- Really?

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.022
- Mhmm.

01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:56.998
Don't we?

01:04:56.998 --> 01:04:58.572
- Mhmm.

01:04:58.572 --> 01:05:03.400
- Well, we've gotta go out and
find new swimsuits ourselves.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.460
Gotta keep my new cub looking fantastic.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:10.023
- Thank you.

01:05:10.023 --> 01:05:12.920
- We'll see you tonight!

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.980
- Well?

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.449
- She wants us to host a party!

01:05:17.449 --> 01:05:19.670
(cheering)

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:20.982
- Oh my God.

01:05:20.982 --> 01:05:22.250
Oh, hey, hey, everybody.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.110
Guys, guys, guys, I need you.

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:25.330
We only got like 20 minutes
to start setting up.

01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:28.098
So just grab whatever you can
and let's go out on the beach.

01:05:28.098 --> 01:05:29.516
- [Dusty] Alright, let's do it!

01:05:29.516 --> 01:05:32.099
(upbeat music)

01:05:42.813 --> 01:05:43.853
- [Stacy] Woohoo!

01:05:43.853 --> 01:05:46.967
- Yes, we did it!

01:05:46.967 --> 01:05:49.060
Hey!

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.160
I'd love to thank you for all of you.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.150
At the beginning, I thought all

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:57.050
I wanted is quiet in nice place,

01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:58.710
but I realized what I really need

01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:00.110
is you and a real good time!

01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:04.153
So toast to all of you!

01:06:04.153 --> 01:06:06.602
(cheering)

01:06:06.602 --> 01:06:08.630
My old friends and new friends!

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:10.340
I love you all!

01:06:11.185 --> 01:06:13.435
(cheering)

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:36.859
- Hello!

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:38.310
Hello everybody, how's it going?

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:39.360
Hello!
- Hey!

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.870
- Say, who's in charge here?

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.580
- Hi, my name is Dusty, what's your name?

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.260
- Why, I'm the legendary Horndog!

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:53.750
Hey, thank you, thank you.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:57.360
Ladies and gentleman, after 15 long years,

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.220
both sides of the beach have been reunited

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.447
by the lovely Horndog queen, Dusty!

01:07:02.447 --> 01:07:04.697
(cheering)

01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:08.930
Thank you, my queen, thank you.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.920
And I hope to see you all again next year!

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.416
Let's party, everyone!

01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:15.666
(cheering)

01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:19.599
(upbeat music)

01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:27.637
- Oh, looking good, Brigitte.

01:10:27.637 --> 01:10:28.648
- Oh, thank you.

01:10:28.648 --> 01:10:30.830
Wow, what a great party!

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:31.663
- Thank you.

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.940
- Looking good, dude!

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:35.840
- Oh, thanks, bro.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.733
- What was that?

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:40.340
- Oh, um, I'm sorry.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.860
Thank you, Brad.

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.090
- There, that's better.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.270
You gotta teach these cubs early

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:50.560
or they'll run right over you.

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:58.731
- So, what happens after this weekend?

01:10:58.731 --> 01:11:02.940
- I don't know, and I honestly
don't wanna think about it.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:07.940
I'm just enjoying this perfect weekend.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.058
- So did you really mean that?

01:11:13.058 --> 01:11:14.066
- What?

01:11:14.066 --> 01:11:16.280
- About coming back here next year?

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.127
- Hmm, it depends.

01:11:18.127 --> 01:11:20.610
Are you coming with me?

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:25.610
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:11:27.506 --> 01:11:30.524
- [Cory] Woo!

01:11:30.524 --> 01:11:33.274
(peaceful music)

01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:56.042
(rhythmic eerie music)

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.200
- You know what?

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.550
I thought this movie
had reached it's height

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:16.420
with the fully clothed shower scene,

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.170
but the sex scene with the door?

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:25.620
The whole goddamn screen was just a door!

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.150
Not too mention the reuse
of that hilarious gag

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:32.310
from the gross out diarrhea scene.

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:37.310
You idiots must have indigo
orbs the size of Venus by now!

01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:39.890
- [Announcer] At least we got our party!

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:44.890
- Proving yet again that
you have no social life.

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:49.570
You call that a party?

01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:51.610
- There were people gathered and--

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:53.870
- And there was nothing!

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.670
There was some babes and some boobs,

01:12:56.670 --> 01:13:00.490
and I mean idiots, I don't mean tits.

01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:03.990
And they were sitting
at a table and nothing.

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:05.730
- [Announcer] Well, there was--

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:07.910
- There was people at a table,

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:10.690
stock footage not withstanding.

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:11.670
- [Announcer] That's not a party.

01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:14.990
- That was a casual get together at best.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.520
- [Announcer] But, it was implied

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.710
that there were alcoholic
beverages and snacks.

01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:23.770
- The whole damn party was implied.

01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:25.390
- [Announcer] But Horndog said Dusty

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:28.740
saved the day by reunited
the two sides of the beach.

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.480
That's a real crowd pleaser, right?

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:33.150
- Dusty did not do jack shit!

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:35.570
That dude bro wanged the coug and that's

01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:37.600
the whole reason the party took place!

01:13:38.491 --> 01:13:39.890
(throat clearing)

01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:44.110
Oh, my faithful lap dogs are still here.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.260
What do you want?

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.290
Haven't you had enough
torture for one week?

01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:53.370
- [Announcer] Maybe you
should throw them a bone.

01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:56.020
- You know, under normal circumstances

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.350
I would tell you to shut
your stupid cake hole,

01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:03.770
but I think considering
these circumstances,

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.650
I would have to agree.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.390
Here, take these.

01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:11.218
(upbeat music)

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.191
There, satisfied now?

01:14:42.191 --> 01:14:44.110
(crowd booing)

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:45.500
Well, too tough.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.190
You will take it and you will like it.

01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:50.194
That's it for us this week.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:52.360
(crowd cheering)

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.080
You know, normally for
that little outburst

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.310
I would promise that next week
I make you suffer even more,

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:02.280
but I don't think after a movie like that

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.560
I can make good on the promise.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.490
So I will paraphrase my Grandpa de Sade

01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:13.400
and say, it is by way of cinematic pain

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.330
that we arrive at pleasure.

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:20.290
Or was it, rock out with your cock out?

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.590
Either way, whatever works best for you.

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:24.780
Roll credits.

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.263
I'm out this bitch!

01:15:27.167 --> 01:15:29.750
(upbeat music)

01:18:24.424 --> 01:18:25.886
- Ain't nobody here!

01:18:25.886 --> 01:18:27.769
- Well, did we?

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:30.102
Oh man, we missed the party.

01:18:31.167 --> 01:18:34.133
- I told you we should
have taken a ride share.

01:18:34.133 --> 01:18:35.487
- Oh man.

01:18:35.487 --> 01:18:37.570
What are we gonna do now?

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:41.650
- Well, we could have a little beach party

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.000
of our own, little horndog.

01:18:44.239 --> 01:18:46.770
- Ooh, bow-chica-bow-bow.

01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:48.937
(moaning)

01:18:51.285 --> 01:18:55.118
- What did that even
have to do with anything?

01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:59.330
Give me that back!
