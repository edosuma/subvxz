15:47.405 --> 15:48.989
THAT'S WHY WE BROKE UP.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.991

ALL RIGHT?

16:54.931 --> 16:56.474
SHE HAS TO BE

16:54.931 --> 16:56.474

16:56.516 --> 16:58.058
AND GO PLACES

16:56.516 --> 16:58.058

17:00.478 --> 17:02.062
ALL ABOUT YOU.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.105
EXACTLY. THANK YOU.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.858
NOT BEING THE CENTER

17:03.147 --> 17:04.858

17:04.899 --> 17:08.235
LIKE YOU'RE NOT SPECIAL,

17:04.899 --> 17:08.235
BUT, HEY, IT'S OKAY, C-BEAR.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.655
EVERYBODY FEELS INSECURE

17:08.277 --> 17:10.655

17:10.697 --> 17:14.868
OKAY, I JUST REALIZED THAT

17:10.697 --> 17:14.868

SO I'M GONNA STAY AND EAT

17:14.909 --> 17:17.077
