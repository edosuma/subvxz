00:02.068 --> 00:03.467
Of all the places you go...

00:04.804 --> 00:06.772
...the dry cleaning relationship's
the most bizarre.

00:06.939 --> 00:09.033
You keep giving each other
the same thing...

00:09.209 --> 00:11.268
...back and forth over and over again.

00:11.444 --> 00:14.470
He gives it to you, you give it to him,
he gives it back to you.

00:14.647 --> 00:16.740
It's like it's half his shirt, in a way.

00:16.916 --> 00:18.406
He has it as much as you do.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.577
You ought to go shopping with him.
"What do you think of this shirt?"

00:21.755 --> 00:24.189
"That would look good
with a light starch."

00:25.692 --> 00:28.889
The only warning label people
respect is "dry-clean only."

00:29.062 --> 00:31.553
Speed limits, lung cancer,
cigarette warnings...

00:31.731 --> 00:34.791
...your very life is at stake.
People go, "Ah, the hell with it."

00:34.968 --> 00:37.334
But dry-clean only?
"Don't put that in the wash.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.665
It's dry-clean only. Are you crazy?"

00:45.245 --> 00:46.712
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.872
-How did you sleep?
-You're on the couch tonight.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.575
-You were all over my side.
-I was not.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.720
I was sleeping
with one cheek off the bed.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.048
By the way, you're falling way behind
on the "I love you's."

00:59.225 --> 01:02.092
-No, no, 12-8.
-No, it's 15-8.

01:03.196 --> 01:05.254
I know I can't beat you.
I'm trying to stay competitive.

01:05.432 --> 01:08.060
-Let's get some breakfast.
-Let me get a coat.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.768
I think I'll try a sports jacket
and scarf thing.

01:10.937 --> 01:13.167
You know,
like an unemployed actor.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.710
I haven't worn this one
in a long time.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.813
-Cashmere?
-No, Gore-Tex.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.714
It's new.

01:23.883 --> 01:26.283
Look at this locket.
What the hell's this?

01:26.453 --> 01:28.216
There's a picture in here.
Look at that.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.549
This is really old.
You don't know whose it is?

01:30.723 --> 01:33.248
I haven't worn this jacket
since I had it dry-cleaned.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.451
-Maybe we should ask.
-We'll stop over there.

01:35.628 --> 01:38.119
-What do you wanna get for breakfast?
-Pancakes.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.027
Come on, you know
I'm getting pancakes.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.691
-I don't know that.
-We can't both get pancakes.

01:42.869 --> 01:46.771
It's embarrassing. That's one step
from the couples that dress alike.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.932
-I'll get the short stack.
-That's why I love you.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.509
15-9.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.080
-How you doing?
-We just got back from breakfast.

01:56.249 --> 01:59.343
-Pancakes were dynamite.
-Is that my maple syrup?

02:01.754 --> 02:02.778
Yeah.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.651
-You bring your own syrup?
-You got to.

02:04.824 --> 02:06.792
You got a lot to learn
about pancakes.

02:09.562 --> 02:12.554
This is my wife.
She died eight years ago.

02:12.732 --> 02:14.632
I've been looking all over for this.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.861
It's lucky that I put the jacket on.
How did it get in the pocket?

02:18.037 --> 02:21.632
The chain is broken. It must have
slipped in when I was...

02:22.509 --> 02:26.172
I turned my house
upside down looking for this.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.680
-It's all I have left of her.
-That's so touching.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.146
You know what
I'm gonna do?

02:31.484 --> 02:34.885
I'm gonna give you and your family
25 percent off your dry cleaning.

02:35.054 --> 02:38.182
-Oh, come on. It's silly.
-Forget it.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.586
-Get out of here.
-It's done.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.021
All right.

02:41.194 --> 02:44.755
I guess I get it too,
because I'm his wife.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.698
I didn't know you were married.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.698
Oh, yeah.

02:51.671 --> 02:55.232
You never met my wife, Meryl.
Meryl Seinfeld.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.101
Yeah, sure.
You get the discount too.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.178
You might regret that.
The money my wife...

03:00.346 --> 03:02.906
...spends on clothes...
-I'm taking him to the cleaners.

03:03.082 --> 03:04.413
See her sense of humor?

03:04.584 --> 03:07.781
I'm so nuts about you.
I tell you, it was fun being single.

03:07.954 --> 03:11.720
But when you meet a woman like this,
you don't walk to get married. You run.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.490
Oh. Hi, Greg.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.256
-Haven't seen you in a while.
-Yeah.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.423
Today was the first day
I've worked out...

03:21.601 --> 03:23.432
...since the Central Park
mini-marathon.

03:23.603 --> 03:27.699
-You ran the mini-marathon?
-No, but I exercised that day.

03:29.976 --> 03:31.443
I gotta take off.

03:31.611 --> 03:34.512
As an airline pilot, you're one
of the few people who can...

03:34.681 --> 03:36.706
...say that and mean it.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.945
-Do you have the time?
-Eleven-thirty.

03:43.156 --> 03:46.455
-Eleven-thirty?
-Wait, wait, 10:30. Sorry.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.920
-You have to be somewhere?
-No.

03:49.128 --> 03:51.653
-What are you doing?
-Just waiting for my friend George.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.628
We worked out together.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.732
-Well, it's good seeing you.
-Nice to see you too.

03:57.103 --> 03:58.434
Bye.

04:05.211 --> 04:06.701
Would you..?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.672
-Can I..?
-Pardon?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.640
The syrup.
Would you pass the syrup?

04:10.883 --> 04:14.751
Oh, you want to try the syrup.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.350
Can I get you anything else?

04:19.225 --> 04:21.625
Yeah. My wife and I
will have a little more coffee.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.285
-Okay.
-And the check for my husband.

04:28.701 --> 04:29.998
To my beautiful wife.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.599
To my adoring husband.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.773
-Adoring? What about handsome?
-I like adoring.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.775
Yeah, sure. Adoring's good for you.
What's it do for me?

04:41.314 --> 04:42.747
Excuse me.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.945
Where did you get that?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.710
I... Well...

04:46.886 --> 04:51.346
We don't allow
any outside syrups...

04:51.691 --> 04:54.524
...jams, or condiments
in the restaurant.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.356
And if I catch you in here
with that again...

04:59.532 --> 05:01.625
...I will confiscate it.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.634
Well, I told my wife not to bring it.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.306
Really? Twenty-five percent off?

05:08.474 --> 05:11.238
-Do I get that too?
-No. Just Meryl.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.574
-Why does she get it?
-Because she's my wife.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.378
Yeah?

05:20.653 --> 05:23.588
I tell you, I'm really enjoying
this marriage thing.

05:23.756 --> 05:26.224
You think about each other.
You care about each other.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.257
It's wonderful.
I love saying "My wife."

05:28.428 --> 05:30.225
Once I started saying it,
I can't stop.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.455
"My wife" this, "my wife" that.

05:32.632 --> 05:35.396
It's an amazing way
to begin a sentence.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.533
"My wife has an inner ear infection."

05:41.040 --> 05:43.167
-See?
-I like that.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.835
Will you do me a favor? Will you
take my quilt into the cleaners...

05:47.013 --> 05:48.605
...so I can get the discount too?

05:48.781 --> 05:50.908
We'll start doing this now?
I can't be taking...

05:51.084 --> 05:55.180
...all your dry cleaning in.
-Just this one time. It's expensive.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.582
Hey, Elaine.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.624
What do you say, if neither of us
is married in 10 years...

06:00.793 --> 06:02.727
...we get hitched?
-Let's make it 50.

06:03.996 --> 06:06.988
We're engaged.
All right, I'm gonna get my quilt.

06:08.668 --> 06:10.033
All right. Listen to this.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.101
Remember that guy
at the health club?

06:12.271 --> 06:13.704
The flyboy. Where's George?

06:13.873 --> 06:16.137
-I thought he was with you.
-He didn't show up.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.335
Anyway, this guy gave me...

06:19.512 --> 06:21.707
...an open-lip kiss.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.580
-So?
-So?

06:24.784 --> 06:26.445
We've always just kind of pecked.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.211
This one had a different dynamic.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.980
-Really?
-Yeah. I mean...

06:30.156 --> 06:32.522
His upper lip landed flush
on my upper lip...

06:32.692 --> 06:36.992
...but his lower lip landed
well below my rim.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.256
-Moisture?
-Yeah. Definite moisture.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.400
-That's an open-lip kiss, all right.
-Yeah.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.464
I think he's giving me a big signal.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.831
Maybe he wants
to change our relationship.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.073
Yeah.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.644
<i>-It's George.
-Hey, what happened to you?</i>

06:55.515 --> 06:57.915
<i>Nothing. A little problem.</i>

07:00.019 --> 07:01.816
What was it? I mean, I was waiting.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.718
<i>Can I come upstairs, please?</i>

07:05.858 --> 07:07.416
Maybe he wants to ask me out.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.754
Why are you interested?
He's a jerk.

07:10.129 --> 07:13.155
Because he doesn't pay any
attention to me, and he ignores me.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.460
-Yeah, so?
-I respect that.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.630
What happened?

07:21.808 --> 07:24.971
Nothing, I said it was
a little problem.

07:25.144 --> 07:26.873
Yeah, what was it?

07:28.514 --> 07:31.540
I was in the locker room
showering, and I...

07:31.818 --> 07:34.981
...I had to go, so...
-Here we go.

07:38.925 --> 07:42.656
Anyway, I think the guy
in the shower opposite saw me.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.588
He even gave me a dirty look.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.064
You went...

07:48.234 --> 07:49.929
...in the shower?

07:51.571 --> 07:53.402
Yeah, so what?

07:53.573 --> 07:55.336
I'm not the only one.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.169
-Do you go in the shower?
-No, never.

07:57.343 --> 08:00.073
-Do you?
-I take baths.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.477
What was I supposed to do?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.619
Get out of the shower,
put on my bathrobe...

08:07.787 --> 08:10.221
...go to the other end,
come all the way back?

08:10.690 --> 08:13.682
Did you ever hear of holding it in?

08:14.093 --> 08:16.721
Oh, no. That's very bad
for the kidneys.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.658
-How do you know?
-Medical journals.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.531
Do the medical journals
mention anything...

08:22.702 --> 08:25.227
...about standing in a pool
of someone else's urine?

08:30.276 --> 08:31.504
Hello.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.544
-Oh, hi, honey.
-What are you doing here?

08:34.714 --> 08:37.114
I just thought
I'd drop off a few things.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.279
I must have been in
the incinerator room when you left.

08:41.453 --> 08:42.921
Here you go, Marty.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.579
Another quilt?

08:45.291 --> 08:47.555
-Jerry.
-Uncle Leo.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.695
-Hello.
-Hello.

08:49.896 --> 08:53.457
If you or your wife
want to drop by on Wednesday...

08:54.567 --> 08:56.000
Your wife?

08:56.168 --> 08:57.499
Yeah.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.428
My wife.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.539
What are you talking about?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.208
I got married.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.577
You got married?

09:08.748 --> 09:10.841
I wasn't invited?

09:11.450 --> 09:13.611
Nobody sends me an invitation?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.649
Well, it was sudden.

09:15.821 --> 09:19.279
Are you ashamed of your uncle?
Do I embarrass you?

09:19.458 --> 09:21.653
No, no. It was a small ceremony.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.954
Haven't I always been
the good uncle?

09:24.130 --> 09:25.529
Yes, yes, you have.

09:25.698 --> 09:28.667
Who told you when you went
to school that you print well?

09:28.834 --> 09:30.495
You did.

09:30.670 --> 09:33.662
When he was younger, he had
a beautiful penmanship.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.568
I used to encourage him to print.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.733
-I'm a good printer.
-I remember your "V."

09:38.911 --> 09:41.277
It was like a perfect triangle.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.911
-Oh, there's my bus.
-There you go.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.413
-Hello! Wait!
-Uncle Leo. Uncle...

09:50.256 --> 09:52.486
I'm glad you're here.
This can get really boring.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.618
You know where I can get
some good olives?

09:56.329 --> 09:57.921
-I can find out.
-Would you?

09:58.097 --> 09:59.291
Sure.

09:59.465 --> 10:03.663
<i>Oh, a project.
That's a definite signal.</i>

10:04.103 --> 10:06.537
By the way, you look
really great in that leotard.

10:07.406 --> 10:08.498
Thanks.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.142
<i>That's no signal.
Who wouldn't like me in this leotard?</i>

10:11.310 --> 10:14.143
<i>I look amazing in this leotard.</i>

10:14.780 --> 10:17.613
It's weird. I think I had a dream
about you last night.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.149
<i>Okay, he open-lips me,
he dreams about me...</i>

10:20.319 --> 10:23.948
<i>... we have an olive project, that's it.
I'm asking this guy out.</i>

10:24.390 --> 10:26.517
-You know, Greg...
-Can I have a sip of water?

10:26.692 --> 10:28.683
-Yeah, sure.
-Thanks.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.592
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

10:37.036 --> 10:40.631
-I'm sorry. What were you saying?
-It was nothing. Forget it.

10:41.507 --> 10:42.906
See that guy right there?

10:43.142 --> 10:44.973
-Yeah. You mean him?
-Yeah.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.772
I caught him urinating
in the shower.

10:49.015 --> 10:51.040
I'm thinking about
turning him in too.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.985
Honey, could you get me
something to drink?

11:04.163 --> 11:07.394
-You're right there.
-Come on, I'm sitting.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.139
Honey, what did you do
with the can opener?

11:15.307 --> 11:18.208
-I didn't do anything with it.
-It's not here. It was here yesterday.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.107
-It's in the first drawer.
-I'm looking in the first drawer.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.510
-It's not here.
-Yes, it is.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.310
Hey, I'm not stupid.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.850
I'm looking in that drawer.
There's no can opener.

11:28.354 --> 11:32.347
-Did I say you were stupid?
-Well, wouldn't I have to be?

11:33.926 --> 11:36.087
You tell me there's a can opener
in the drawer...

11:36.262 --> 11:38.230
...I'm looking,
there's no can opener.

11:38.397 --> 11:40.797
What other conclusion
could one reach?

11:40.966 --> 11:44.163
-You want me to go find it?
-Yes, I do.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.128
You show me where there's
a can opener in that drawer.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.467
Hello. I'm sorry.
I'm just fighting with my wife.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.734
Jerry, we just heard.
What's going on?

11:51.911 --> 11:53.139
Why didn't you tell us?

11:53.312 --> 11:55.780
-Listen, Mom...
-It was in here yesterday.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.075
Yeah. That's what I said.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.652
Who is she?
When did this happened?

12:00.820 --> 12:02.287
I told her you'd get married.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.218
She thought you'd never do it.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.654
-Morty, you're talking too loud.
-I'm not.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.727
-You're hurting my eardrum.
-You must've done something with it.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.328
I'm on the phone.

12:11.497 --> 12:13.988
Is she there? Can we talk to her?
What's her name?

12:14.166 --> 12:15.656
Mom, I'm not married.

12:15.835 --> 12:17.962
<i>-What?
-I'm not married.</i>

12:18.137 --> 12:20.002
I knew it. I told you.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.434
Uncle Leo said.

12:21.607 --> 12:25.236
I'm just pretending I'm married
to get a discount on dry cleaning.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.935
A discount on dry cleaning?

12:27.713 --> 12:29.408
Could you make a little more noise?

12:30.816 --> 12:32.078
I'll have to call you later.

12:33.385 --> 12:34.613
Well, I give up.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.846
Well, whoopee-woo.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.355
-You got any coffee?
-Yeah.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.150
Oh, boy.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.394
I'll get it, I'll get it.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.296
Take it easy. Why are you so tired?

12:50.903 --> 12:53.167
My quilt is still at the cleaners.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.206
Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.037
The other night I was cold,
so last night...

12:59.211 --> 13:03.011
...I turned up the heat, it's too hot.
I opened up a window, it's too cold.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.878
I can't get into the zone.

13:07.486 --> 13:09.681
What is that? That.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.148
I forgot.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.295
I'm sorry about all that
can opener stuff.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.523
Yeah. Me too.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.826
-I love you.
-I love you.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.302
-Well, good night.
-Good night.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.373
They could kick me out
if he tells them.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.485
What do you want me to do?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.848
-Talk to him.
-How can I do that?

13:43.022 --> 13:45.013
You said the guy gave you
an open-lipped kiss.

13:45.191 --> 13:48.251
But then he wiped his hand
on the top of the bottle...

13:48.427 --> 13:51.021
...when I offered him water.

13:51.530 --> 13:52.895
That doesn't mean anything.

13:53.065 --> 13:54.896
Are you kidding?
That's very significant.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.160
If he was interested in me,
he'd want my germs.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.133
He'd just crave my germs.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.636
She's right, George.
Bottle-wipe is big.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.832
What about the open-lip kiss?

14:04.009 --> 14:06.534
Bottle-wipe supersedes it.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.812
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.178
Maybe he's not interested,
but you still know him.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.650
-Can't you just ask him?
-George.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.288
But if I ask him now...

14:17.489 --> 14:20.356
...I will have no chance
of going out with him.

14:20.759 --> 14:22.693
Why?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.191
I don't know.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.967
Could it be because
you don't want him to know...

14:33.138 --> 14:35.003
...that your friend
pees in the shower?

14:35.207 --> 14:37.107
-That's not it.
-I think it is.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.801
-That's exactly what it is.
-Why couldn't you wait?

14:39.979 --> 14:42.106
I was there. I saw a drain.

14:42.281 --> 14:45.341
-Since when is a drain a toilet?
-It's all pipes.

14:45.517 --> 14:48.452
-What's the difference?
-Different pipes go to different places.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.715
-You're gonna mix them up.
-I'll call a plumber right now.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.349
-Can we just drop the pee-pipes stuff?
-Okay.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.654
Okay, okay, I will talk to him.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.459
-Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
-All right.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.693
-You gotta pick it up.
-I'll pick it up.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.736
-But it's the last time I'm doing it.
-I'm so tired.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.204
-You don't look good.
-Huh? I don't?

15:09.375 --> 15:11.434
-No. You look pale.
-Pale?

15:11.677 --> 15:15.408
Oh, my God.
I gotta meet Anna's parents today.

15:19.184 --> 15:21.880
Hello? Hi, honey.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.515
Yes, I told him.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.157
I'll get it.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.389
Whenever.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.594
Okay.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.795
Okay, I'm sorry.

15:39.405 --> 15:43.000
-I'm sorry. It's not ready yet.
-Not ready?

15:43.542 --> 15:46.875
It has to be ready. What kind
of a business are you running here?

15:47.046 --> 15:49.378
Who the hell are you?
It's not your quilt.

15:49.548 --> 15:52.745
He's a good friend of mine.
He's like an older brother to me.

15:52.918 --> 15:55.785
When things don't go right,
he takes it personally.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.290
-Maybe tomorrow.
-Maybe.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.049
It's okay. It'll be okay.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.886
-I'll see you later.
-Where you going?

16:02.061 --> 16:05.155
I gotta meet Anna's parents,
remember? I look terrible.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.231
I'm gonna hit
the tanning machines.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.127
I can't believe you still do that.
It's bad for you.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.133
That's how I maintain my glow.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.496
-I'm going home.
-Yeah.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.678
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

16:21.413 --> 16:23.005
How much would it cost
to clean this?

16:23.182 --> 16:26.174
-Oh, about $13.
-Thirteen?

16:26.752 --> 16:28.583
Well, I can't afford that.

16:29.555 --> 16:32.046
Well, I'm sorry.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.328
-Hi, Greg.
-Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.902
Okay.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.129
I got the machine next, buddy.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.804
It's all yours.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.348
What happened?
Did he bring it up?

17:04.522 --> 17:06.820
Never mind that.
Look at the signal I just got.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.482
Signal? What signal?

17:08.660 --> 17:11.127
He knew I'd use it next.
He didn't wipe his sweat off.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.161
That's a gesture of intimacy.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.199
I'll tell you what that is.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.300
That's a violation of club rules.

17:17.469 --> 17:21.337
-Now I got him. You're my witness.
-Wait a second, George. Listen.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.941
He knew what he was doing.
This was a signal.

17:24.108 --> 17:27.875
-A guy leaves sweat, that's a signal?
-Yes. It's a social thing.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.982
If he left a used Kleenex,
what's that, a valentine?

17:31.617 --> 17:34.211
You tell him if he's thinking
of turning me in...

17:34.386 --> 17:37.378
...that I got the goods on him.
-No. I won't be a party to this.

17:37.556 --> 17:41.185
So you're gonna let me get suspended
for shower urination?

17:41.360 --> 17:42.622
Okay, I'll talk to him...

17:42.795 --> 17:45.730
...but you're putting me
in very a difficult position.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.198
-I can't let you do this.
-I want to.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.406
-But it isn't right. I can't.
-Give me the clothes.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.234
Jerry, please.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.076
-What about her?
-Oh, the hell with her.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.510
I can't.

18:11.323 --> 18:12.790
No, Jerry, please.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.552
I'm not gonna let you
walk out of my life.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.158
I can't fight you.

18:24.369 --> 18:25.802
Do you want box or hanger?

18:26.705 --> 18:28.536
You decide.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.720
You're really working up
quite a sweat today.

18:49.895 --> 18:50.953
Yeah.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.495
Oh, there's the manager.

18:52.664 --> 18:55.098
Good. I think I'm gonna
talk to her about that guy.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.894
We can't have people like that here.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.630
-Are you sure you wanna do that?
-Yeah. He's disgusting.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.297
Besides, I'll take
any chance I can to talk to her.

19:06.578 --> 19:09.775
-You're interested in her?
-Very.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.815
You know, I'm engaged.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.616
Yep, I'm getting married in 50 years.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.357
Oh, good, there he is.

19:25.531 --> 19:28.364
I wanna be able to point him out.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.826
You know, Greg,
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.472
-Why?
-Well, correct me if I'm wrong...

19:34.640 --> 19:37.541
...but isn't it a violation of club policy...

19:37.709 --> 19:40.872
...to not wipe down a machine
after using it?

19:44.716 --> 19:46.741
Oh, I see.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.444
You're friends with the urinator,
aren't you?

19:49.621 --> 19:50.883
Yeah, well...

19:51.056 --> 19:53.456
...at least he had a drain.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.127
There you go, Mrs. Seinfeld.

20:02.301 --> 20:06.067
With your 25 percent discount,
it comes to $17.80.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.629
Here you go.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.113
Excuse me, this isn't mine.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.848
Oh, yes, it is.

20:18.016 --> 20:20.109
Your husband brought it in himself.

20:21.453 --> 20:22.943
Really?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.289
Thank you.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.885
That's him.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.294
Hi.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.508
You son of a bitch.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.472
-I'm sorry.
-Who is she?

20:50.649 --> 20:53.311
-I want to know who she is.
-It doesn't matter.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.446
I want a divorce.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.821
A divorce?

20:58.991 --> 21:01.824
So you can marry her
and give her the discount?

21:02.527 --> 21:03.926
Yes, that's right.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.190
-What happened to us, Jerry?
-I'll tell you what happened.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.163
We got married.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.760
I'm sorry. This is my fault.
I pushed it on you.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.135
No. I guess I just wasn't ready
for the responsibilities...

21:16.308 --> 21:18.276
...of a pretend marriage.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.445
Goodbye, Jerry.

21:24.249 --> 21:25.614
I forgot.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.915
This is your maple syrup.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.380
It's all right, I want you to have it.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.583
Okay, thanks.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.290
We'll always have pancakes.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.690
Goodbye, Jerry.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.132
I thought you said
you was bringing a white boy home.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.329
I don't see a white boy.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.474
I see a damn fool.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.620
To me, the thing about marriage is...

22:02.788 --> 22:05.120
...I can't believe
how often it happens.

22:06.958 --> 22:10.018
I like the idea of it, but I can't believe
that many people...

22:10.195 --> 22:13.221
...are meeting people that they want
to see every single day...

22:13.398 --> 22:16.731
...every day, every day,
every day, every day.

22:16.902 --> 22:19.063
That should happen,
like, three or four times...

22:19.237 --> 22:21.330
...you know, in the whole century.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.031
Like any major investment,
you sign a marriage contract.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.803
Here's your person.
If you're a man, the bride's family...

22:26.978 --> 22:29.242
...pays for the wedding,
like getting cash back.

22:29.414 --> 22:32.406
"Till death do us part" that's
the extended warranty program.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.848
You give her the ring,
that's the keys.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.683
You slide it on, start him up,
but you've got to make it work.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.759
Your value drops 20 percent when
you drive each other off the lot.
