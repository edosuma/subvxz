WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.600
-[drum and bass plays]
-Stevie!

00:04.640 --> 00:07.320
-I'm gonna shoot off, mate.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.040
I've topped up your snack bowl.
All right, mate?

00:10.080 --> 00:12.080
Sweet, bruv!

00:12.120 --> 00:16.440
Just locking him in
to keep him safe.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.720
<i>You know, business is going
great at the moment.</i>

00:22.760 --> 00:26.680
<i>I have my T-shirt business.
I have my internet cabin
caf√© business.</i>

00:26.720 --> 00:31.040
<i>But the hardest business
to manage is the business
of love, you know?</i>

00:31.080 --> 00:33.680
<i>I will wait for Aldona...</i>

00:33.720 --> 00:36.320
for as long as it takes.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.640
If she needs to blow off
a bit of steam and a bit
of my money,

00:39.680 --> 00:43.080
then that's her business.
It's good to blow off steam.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.080
There's no shame in that.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.320
It's healthy.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.480
[Miche] First one in,
last one to leave.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.440
Shows I'm dedicated though.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.440
[alarm beeps]

00:55.480 --> 00:57.600
[alarm stops]

00:59.920 --> 01:03.720
-I'm a bit tired today though.
-[director] So why are
you tired?

01:03.760 --> 01:07.440
Oh, Grindah's got insomnia
because of the weed drought.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.880
So he just kept waking me up
through the night to check
if I'd gone to sleep yet

01:10.920 --> 01:15.040
and asking me for glasses
of water and that.
Bless him.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.360
Danger. How's it going,
man? You all right?

01:20.400 --> 01:23.680
Yeah, still doing
the radio stuff.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.720
Just wanted to know if you've
got anything at the moment.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.760
He will buy a zoot, like,
literally, it's that bad.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.000
Obviously, I can function
without weed, but
I choose not to.

01:34.040 --> 01:37.360
Cos, like, if I don't smoke,
like, I start getting headaches,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.760
worrying about everything.
"Oh, I've got bills to pay!

01:40.800 --> 01:45.200
Oh, someone's gonna cut off
the whatever if I don't
pay it now."

01:45.240 --> 01:48.840
Weed helps you forget all that.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.160
Alfie Dangers got nothing, man.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.840
Oh, for fuck's sake!

01:53.880 --> 01:59.120
Decoy, come on, mate, you
must be able to get something.
You're a Rasta, for fuck's sake.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.640
-I'm not a Rasta.
-Course you are. Just cos you
ain't got all the long hair.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.600
Don't sell yourself short,
Decoy.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.800
-Don't tell him anything,
it's wasted on him.
-Yeah.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.360
There she is! You did it!
Congratulations!

02:15.400 --> 02:18.640
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, bless!

02:18.680 --> 02:20.720
-Look at it.
-It looks brilliant.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.880
Angela's passed her level one
hairdresser's certificate.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.520
-Great!
-Yeah?

02:25.560 --> 02:27.800
-Put that in a frame, Miche.
-Oh, okay, then.

02:27.840 --> 02:31.240
-What did your mum say?
-It doesn't really
need to be framed.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.920
<i>Well, Angela's been here
a bit longer than me,</i>

02:33.960 --> 02:36.840
<i>but we're both
trainee hairdressers.</i>

02:36.880 --> 02:41.400
So, basically, what that
means is that we are training
to become hairdressers, so...

02:41.440 --> 02:45.600
Are roles are basically
the same. She's definitely
not above me.

02:45.640 --> 02:50.000
Look at that! Pride of place.
"Level one hairdressing,
Angela Wilson".

02:50.040 --> 02:52.400
I mean, obviously, for me,
the big dream is

02:52.440 --> 02:55.600
I'm going to have my own
beauty range with my
face on it, so...

02:55.640 --> 02:59.400
Probably aiming a little bit
higher than her, cos,
not being funny,

02:59.440 --> 03:02.800
but I don't think her face
would really work
for a beauty range.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.360
[Tanya] Cos today's
a special day, as you know,

03:05.400 --> 03:07.800
you're with Susan all day.
You're going to be working
on colours.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.400
-[Angela] Oh, my God!
Are you serious?
-Yeah! You deserve it.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.560
-You all right, Miche?
-Yeah, I'm just sweeping.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.000
Actually, Miche, I've got
a nail appointment

03:17.040 --> 03:19.960
-in about 20 minutes...
-Yeah, I can do that.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.680
Not "do" the appointment. I
was thinking if you could just
clear up in the treatment room.

03:23.720 --> 03:27.680
-Do a couple of Brazilians
in there yesterday.
-Yeah, I can do that.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.920
It's a little bit of a
state in there. Yeah?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.240
Good lad, good lad.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.120
That's it. Good guy.

03:37.160 --> 03:41.680
There we go. Stevie,
you're a machine, mate!
You don't bloody stop.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.520
I did actually try and stop,
but the door was, like, locked.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.560
Probably jammed or something.
Anyway, listen...

03:48.600 --> 03:52.080
You're a free man now and
tomorrow these T-shirts

03:52.120 --> 03:54.800
are going to be all the talk
of Hounslow high street.

03:54.840 --> 03:59.560
D&G T-shirts at half the retail
price of Dolce & Gabbana.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.000
It's D&G.

04:02.040 --> 04:05.160
Deepak & Gurdev have a right
to make their own T-shirts,
too, mate.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.000
Know what I mean? Oh, mate.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.280
We are going to make
so much money, man!

04:11.320 --> 04:14.960
We are? Do I get
paid or anything?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.800
Yeah, obviously, you get...
you get your printing free,

04:17.839 --> 04:20.120
which I was going
to give to you anyway.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.400
Let's see how much that is.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.000
Round it up, cash
flow, net profit, take
away the working tax credit.

04:26.040 --> 04:30.160
-Let's round it up to a tenner.
-Oh, rounded it up as well.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.680
Ten pounds just for that!

04:33.720 --> 04:36.320
I'll keep that safe.

04:36.360 --> 04:41.840
It's actually safer than a
wallet, cos you can't really
lose socks while they're on.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.400
All right, man.
I'm gonna do one.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.320
Have a nap, mate. He hasn't
slept for, like, four days.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.920
[drum and bass plays]

04:59.960 --> 05:03.120
Gonna have to have a scud zoot.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.800
Got a few crumbs here.
Have you found anything?

05:05.840 --> 05:10.280
Tiny bit of resin. Couple
of seeds from that bush
me and Steves had as well.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.400
Did you ever used to watch
<i>Blue Peter</i> back in the day?

05:13.440 --> 05:17.720
-No.
-Maybe we could just bury
bare weed in a time capsule

05:17.760 --> 05:20.640
and just put it in the garden.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.080
Or we could bury these
seeds in a plant pot

05:26.120 --> 05:28.240
and grow our own.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.720
That's sick. We'd never
have a drought again.

05:30.760 --> 05:34.560
Yeah. We could even call it
the Kurupt FM weed farm!

05:34.600 --> 05:39.840
Oh! You can put it in the
bathroom as well. It'd be
like a natural air freshener.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.240
You could, like, bill a zoot
whilst taking a shit.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.640
-Oh!
-Proper luxurious.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.000
-I would love that.
-[director] Have you ever
grown weed before?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.480
Well...

05:50.520 --> 05:52.960
You know, I mean...

05:53.000 --> 05:57.120
<i>I mean, that's not something
we could actually talk
about on camera.</i>

05:57.160 --> 06:01.840
But let's say, if you
had a helicopter with
a heat-sensitive camera on,

06:01.880 --> 06:04.680
floating over the top
of Kurupt, you'd know
what time it is.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.840
Exactly.
That's all we're saying.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.280
-So you have?
-That's all we're saying.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.560
-My lips are sealed.
-Exactly. So are mine.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.074

06:28.200 --> 06:29.720
Aldona?

06:29.760 --> 06:32.280
Oh, my...

06:35.720 --> 06:37.120
Baby!

06:37.160 --> 06:39.760
-I'm so sorry.
-You came back!

06:47.960 --> 06:51.520
Where the fuck have you been?
I was so worried.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.360
<i>I can't even describe it.
There's no words.</i>

06:54.400 --> 06:57.160
All the doubters were
doubting me and, like,

06:57.200 --> 07:00.480
they were all saying,
"Oh, you're crazy." And
you know what? Maybe I am.

07:00.520 --> 07:04.360
But the voices in my head,
they were telling me, like,
"Just end it all, mate.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.000
You're a failure. There's no
point. What's the point,
mate? Kill yourself!"

07:08.040 --> 07:10.960
But, no, no. If it's crazy
to be in love,

07:11.000 --> 07:14.480
then I'm bloody mental,
bat-shit crazy, mate.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.520
Lock me up.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.760
Your hair's looking in
really good condition.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.720
Yeah, like, really good,
considering you're getting
it coloured and stuff.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.600
You must condition it a lot.
Just keep doing what
you're doing.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.720
I think you might have missed
a bit there, Angela.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.640
Did you actually find
your course useful then?

07:37.680 --> 07:39.720
Yeah, it was really good,
actually.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.720
I always feel like hairdressing
is a natural talent for me.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.080
I don't really need
to do a course.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.640
I just did it cos you need
the qualification, don't ya?

07:47.680 --> 07:50.440
-If you're gonna cut hair
in a salon and that.
-Yeah, yeah.

07:50.480 --> 07:55.360
I'm doing one at the moment,
actually. I'm just saying
that I don't need one, so...

07:55.400 --> 07:58.560
-Where did you do yours then?
-Hammersmith.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.520
Oh, all right.
You went for a local one.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.120
-Yeah. Why,
where'd you do yours?
-Mine's actually international.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.480
-Really? Whereabouts?
-The internet.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.760
It's an online course, but the
internet's based in America.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.520
Well, I haven't started the
online course yet, but I'm
in the enrolment process.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.880
So I've started my
online application.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.720
So I've put in my email
address and my name
and that kind of thing.

08:22.760 --> 08:26.400
I just need to put in
my payment details and then
I'll be good to go.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.280
-You've had two already!
-Sorry, mate.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.760
Three tokes.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.000
[door closes]

08:35.039 --> 08:37.840
-Yes, you lot.
-Yeah, Steves. Hi.

08:37.880 --> 08:41.440
-Is that a zoot?
-Nah, there's only
a tiny bit left.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.800
Plus there's a weed drought.
You know the rules, mate.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.040
-I've got a tenner though.
-A tenner's completely
pointless, Steves.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.560
-For fuck's sake.
-Anyway, we're gonna start
a Kurupt FM weed farm, so...

08:52.600 --> 08:57.920
-Couldn't like Decoy
or anyone get anything?
-What? What?

08:57.960 --> 09:01.640
Why would Decoy be able
to get any? So racist.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.160
You've completely disgraced
yourself in front of these boys.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.880
You need to go out and get
us the stuff for the weed
farm, Steves.

09:08.920 --> 09:13.560
We need plant pots, soil and
them 3D lights as well, yeah?

09:13.600 --> 09:16.440
-UV, innit?
-Same thing, mate.
You hear that?

09:16.480 --> 09:20.440
Blimey, man. Literally, just
got... Like, I've just got in.

09:20.480 --> 09:24.760
Steves mate, you don't deserve
to relax after your little
racist outburst, yeah?

09:24.800 --> 09:29.160
You're not wanted round here
for a bit. What's said
is said, mate, all right?

09:29.200 --> 09:31.920
I cannot believe that.

09:31.960 --> 09:36.200
You know, back in the day,
sort of <i> Game Of Thrones</i> time?

09:36.240 --> 09:41.600
They always had like a stupid,
idiot that would work for them.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.760
<i>-You know what I mean?</i>
-Hold it down, hold it down.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.720
<i>Powerful people always have
idiots around them to help
them do things.</i>

09:48.760 --> 09:53.160
Why spend a tenner when you
could get it for free, like?

09:53.200 --> 09:56.400
Free soil as well.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.760
Fucking need something
to put these in.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.320
Ah... Just...
Just doing a bit of recycling.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.320
-[director] <i> So is</i>
<i>Steves trustworthy?</i>
<i>-He's like a dog.</i>

10:14.360 --> 10:18.960
He'll, like, follow you about,
but have no idea, like,
what's going on.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.880
Definitely take that one
as well.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.680
-Oh, a gnome.
-What you doing?

10:26.720 --> 10:29.400
-Oi! Oi!
-Sorry, sorry!

10:29.440 --> 10:31.320
What you...? Oi!

10:33.640 --> 10:36.600
[Tanya] I think we need
some new magazines, actually.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.400
-Just got you a tea.
I'll pop it down here.
-Miche! Miche!

10:41.160 --> 10:43.280
Miche! Can you, er...

10:43.320 --> 10:45.760
-Can you get any bud?
-What?

10:45.800 --> 10:48.240
-Draw, can you get any draw?
-No.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.200
I don't know anyone
that can get draw.
Mum's not with Jason any more.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.000
-Ask one of these lot, then?
-They're my work colleagues!

10:54.040 --> 10:57.080
-They don't even know I smoke.
-What?! They'll think you're
cool if anything.

10:57.120 --> 11:01.040
I'll get fired? There's this
girl that's basically
after my job.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.840
Had an absolute brainwave, mate.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.800
All right, listen, I ain't
got time to talk about
your "new work friends".

11:07.840 --> 11:10.680
UV. There.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.120
-I'm not really into that, mate.
-Yeah, but for the weed farm.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.800
-For the lights.
-Hold on, we could use
that for the weed farm?

11:16.840 --> 11:20.560
-Exactly, yeah.
-What time do they close?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.520
-Seven, bruv.
-Seven, yeah.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.480
-Sweet. We'll get her on it.
-Let's do this.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.600
Mate! I knew there was
a reason for us coming here.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.800
"Got UV lights".

11:34.840 --> 11:38.080
Fuck's sake.
Makes my life easier, anyway.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.120
I've been telling everyone,
you know? I've been saying

11:52.160 --> 11:56.320
that Aldona is coming back.
You know, "You'll see,
you'll see."

11:56.360 --> 11:58.960
[director] So, Aldona,
you were at a funeral?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.680
Uh...yes. My, uh...

12:01.720 --> 12:04.920
My father, he...he is dead.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.080
[he sighs]

12:07.120 --> 12:11.240
Very sad news, you know?
Rest in peace, Daddy.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.560
Great man, great man.
Never met him, personally,

12:14.600 --> 12:17.600
but I imagine that he was
a great man.

12:17.640 --> 12:21.560
The main thing is that she's
back and she's here to stay.

12:21.600 --> 12:26.440
Yes, I don't want anything,
no money, just...just you.

12:26.480 --> 12:30.000
Okay! That can be arranged.
That can be arranged.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.800
Um, I must warn you though,
I haven't shaved or anything.

12:33.840 --> 12:38.640
If I knew you were coming, I'd
have got the back, sack and
crack tidied up a little bit.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.920
So it might get a little bit
jungly down there.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.240
She's back.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.400
Power couple are back.
Very like Jay-Z/Beyonc√©.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.840
She's brown as a looker.
Look how brown she is.
Show the camera.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.720
Look, brown. Jay-Z/Beyonc√©.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.720
Isn't it? Kanye West/Kim K.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.760
-‚ô™ Locked into the sounds
-Of the legendary ‚ô™

13:01.800 --> 13:04.600
-‚ô™ Man, like, MC Grindah
-And the one and only ‚ô™

13:04.640 --> 13:06.320
‚ô™ DJ Beats ‚ô™

13:06.360 --> 13:08.840
Tell 'em what time is it,
Grind?

13:08.880 --> 13:12.160
‚ô™ One, two, three, four, five
Once I caught a fish alive ‚ô™

13:12.200 --> 13:14.320
‚ô™ Garage, baby! ‚ô™

13:14.360 --> 13:17.680
Nah, I can't countdown on
the garage vibe. I'm
not lean enough.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.080
-I knew this would happen.
-Sounded good to me, mate.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.560
Don't let your brain
control you, innit?

13:23.600 --> 13:27.440
It's not my brain. It's, like,
my whole body's weak.
I'm on meltdown mode.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.960
So Grindah and Beats
have found these little seeds.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.200
Insert that.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.480
And I'll just do that
for all of them.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.880
This is Kurupt FM
emergency broadcast.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.720
-It's a warning.
-If you are listening, yeah,
we need some draw now.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.960
-If you can get draw, then call
the phone-line number.
-Yes.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.560
Any draw will do. Weed,
hash, shit holiday draw.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.480
Literally, anything.
We will pay full price.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.560
-Top dollar.
-Why did you say that?

14:01.600 --> 14:03.560
Weed farm ready to go.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.560
Time for someone to start
doing shit round here, yeah?

14:16.160 --> 14:19.080
Wait! Wait there! Wait!

14:19.120 --> 14:21.880
Chill out!

14:27.440 --> 14:30.120
-Shall I come in now?
-Come on then.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.520
Quick, get in! Get in!

14:32.560 --> 14:36.400
-No one's seen us. Chill out.
-No one can know you've
been here, right?

14:36.440 --> 14:40.000
I really don't want to lose
this job before I've
even got it.

14:40.040 --> 14:45.200
Miche, we need this weed farm.
You need this weed farm,
all right?

14:45.240 --> 14:48.000
Nothing's gonna happen.
No one's gonna know.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.560
If someone does found out,
Steves can take the rap,
all right?

14:51.600 --> 14:55.160
-I've got less to lose.
-Exactly.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.040
I'll show you where
the sunbeds are.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.320
Right, go on, Steves.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.000
But you have to keep
the lights off, cos no
one can know you're here.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.800
[Steves] Yeah, that's cool.
I quite like the dark.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.160
I went blind off ketamine
for, like, three hours.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.840
I quite liked it, to be honest.
It gave me time to think.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.360
-[Miche] Is he definitely
gonna be all right?
-Yeah, probably.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.600
[Chabuds sighs]
Whoo!

15:32.640 --> 15:36.600
Completely smooth down there
now. Completely smooth.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.680
It was a right bloody mess
before.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.520
-Is it all right if I?
-Mm.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.800
Oh, yeah.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.440
[director] What do you see
in the future for you
and Aldona?

15:49.480 --> 15:54.400
Oh, for the future, I see a lot
of bi-racial kids, mate, yeah?

15:54.440 --> 15:57.120
A lot of beige little fuckers
running around, you know.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.360
A lot of little Chabulskas.
Chabuddy/Wolskas.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.360
Loads of Chabulskas. You know,
UKIP's nightmare, mate.
So I'm breeding it, mate.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.760
It's a beige future, with
loads of little Polishstani
little fuckers running around.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.480
Imagine, it's just gonna be
beetroot and curry everywhere.

16:12.520 --> 16:16.840
Loads of builders and loads
of corner shops, mate. That's
the army I'm building!

16:16.880 --> 16:19.640
And, uh, they to film or...?

16:19.680 --> 16:22.680
Oh? Okay, guys, come on,
get the hint.

16:22.720 --> 16:27.520
I think it's time for you guys
to go. We need some alone time.
Come on, out you go!

16:27.560 --> 16:30.640
Out you go, out you go!

16:30.680 --> 16:35.400
Listen, guys, I think
I'm pretty much guaranteed
penetration here, right?

16:35.440 --> 16:38.360
So if you wanna... Go on.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.520
Come on, hurry up, get out!
Come on, go! Get out of here.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.280
So, uh, more drink?

16:45.320 --> 16:47.560
[he chuckles]
<i>Zdrowie!</i>

16:47.600 --> 16:49.720
<i>Na zdorovye!</i>

16:49.760 --> 16:52.280
<i>-Kurwa!
-Na zdorovye!</i>

16:59.200 --> 17:01.680
Fuck, I think Craig's up.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.920
Hello, Craig, mate.
How's it going?

17:05.960 --> 17:07.960
-All right?
-Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.319
Playing a bit of computer
and that, yeah?

17:13.599 --> 17:15.960
Don't, um...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.560
Don't suppose any of your
mates smoke bud, do they?

17:18.599 --> 17:21.839
I'm just trying to link it
for a friend of mine.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.800
Nah, there's a weed
drought at the moment.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.240
You know about
the weed drought, yeah?

17:28.280 --> 17:31.200
Do you blaze and that?

17:31.240 --> 17:34.040
You don't have, like, um,

17:34.080 --> 17:36.840
a scud zoot or
a little chip I could have?

17:36.880 --> 17:40.720
-Just to help me get to sleep.
-Thought it was for
your mate?

17:40.760 --> 17:43.720
For my mate to get to sleep.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.560
You what know? Fuck it, man.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.040
It's for me.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.800
I've been blazing since
I was 15 years young.

17:54.840 --> 17:59.680
Non-stop, every day.
So I feel a bit fucked, like,
cos of the drought.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.600
It's really good to have
these chats with you, man.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.840
It's really good to open up
to each other, you know?

18:09.760 --> 18:13.040
I'm gonna shoot off to bed.
I'll see you in the morning.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.440
Enjoy your game.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.080
Fuck! How am I gonna sleep?

18:22.560 --> 18:25.320
[Miche] So has Steves
texted you?

18:25.360 --> 18:28.280
No. Wouldn't bank on it anyway.
He's pretty shit with phones.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.040
Breaks 'em constantly.
He's pretty clumsy.

18:31.080 --> 18:34.360
Do you think maybe we
shouldn't have locked
him in, then?

18:34.400 --> 18:37.280
-Nah, he'll be fine.
-What if he's in there,

18:37.320 --> 18:40.480
and he's freaking out,
he panicking, and he's trying
to ring you and he can't,

18:40.520 --> 18:43.360
-cos his phone won't work
and he's crying...
-Miche, I know all that.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.680
I'm too ill to be worried
about all this, all right?

18:46.720 --> 18:50.160
Worst case scenario, he'll just
smash his way out the shop
front window, whatever.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.840
I'm a bit worried
about that happening.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.960
Oh, my days! Who's sick!
Selecta!

18:57.000 --> 19:00.040
Decoy's uncle's come through
with the food, cuz!

19:00.080 --> 19:04.720
That means weed in English.
I'm meeting his uncles
tomorrow and they're Jamaican.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.360
Oh, sick!

19:07.400 --> 19:11.320
Yeah, so do you think we should
pop out and get Steves now?

19:11.360 --> 19:15.440
No, we can still let him do it.
Planning for the future
and all that.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.480
Man's making them Jamaican
links out 'ere! You get me?

19:18.520 --> 19:22.080
[sings]
Scene, innit?

19:22.120 --> 19:25.320
-Oh, mate! Hold on.
-So shall we give Steves
a call now?

19:25.360 --> 19:29.640
No, no. Hold on. Me and Beats
could make a reggae mix
for the journey tomorrow.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.120
-It might help if you kept
the line clear...
-Beats?

19:33.160 --> 19:35.840
It's Grindah. Right.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.520
Two words, reggae mix.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.760
You know, make a reggae mix
for tomorrow on CD.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.160
Put it on CD. All right.
See you later.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.880
That's the motherland, Jamaica,
that's where everyone
comes from,

19:46.920 --> 19:48.880
whether you're white or black.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.480
Cos what happened was,
this big stone

19:52.520 --> 19:57.160
banged into the world, yeah,
cos the world was just one,
like, bit of land.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.680
-There was dinosaurs and that.
-Dinosaurs and that.

19:59.720 --> 20:03.640
And then it exploded and all
the dinosaurs and the land
got separated.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.160
But, originally,
the stone was Jamaica.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.080
Hello?

20:19.120 --> 20:20.640
Hello?

20:22.800 --> 20:26.120
-Is everything all right?
-You are pricks.

20:26.160 --> 20:30.960
Everywhere I go, just...
"Let's just lock Steves in.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.480
He doesn't matter.
He's just a little mug.

20:34.520 --> 20:37.560
-Just lock him in..."
-Sorry, Steves.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.040
Oh, no! I knew it.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.840
He's broken Angela's frame.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.920
Oh, it's actually fine.

20:56.120 --> 21:00.760
"Ooh, I've done a course."
Level one basic bitch.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.120
[knocking on door]

21:06.680 --> 21:10.080
I must have fully passed out
last night.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.000
Bit of a... Bit crazy.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.440
Did you guys...

21:17.320 --> 21:20.000
Did you guys move the Merc?

21:20.040 --> 21:21.680
It's...

21:21.720 --> 21:23.880
Where's the Merc?

21:26.360 --> 21:29.200
Did you guys see anything?

21:29.240 --> 21:30.480
The...

21:32.080 --> 21:33.920
Aldona?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.080
Aldona, did you...?

21:38.120 --> 21:40.760
Aldona! Aldona, did you...?

21:43.280 --> 21:46.560
Oh, no! No, no, no!

21:46.600 --> 21:49.240
I've been robbed!

21:49.280 --> 21:52.240
The computers! The printer!

21:52.280 --> 21:55.480
Oh, my... The foot spa!

21:57.600 --> 22:00.000
And they've taken Aldona!

22:00.040 --> 22:02.240
Move, move!

22:02.280 --> 22:04.120
Aldona!

22:07.200 --> 22:08.760
Aldona!

22:13.720 --> 22:16.640
-You all right?
-Jamaica.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.680
The land of wood and water.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.840
Can't bloody wait to
meet your uncles, mate.
Heard a lot about 'em.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.400
-Is it?
-Yeah.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.680
-Are they the laid-back type?
-They all right with
non-Rastas as well, right?

22:31.720 --> 22:34.880
-What? No, man, you've
got it twisted, man.
-Yeah, sick.

22:34.920 --> 22:38.080
-Do you want the reggae mix?
-Yeah, put the little
reggae mix on.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.640
[reggae plays]

22:53.160 --> 22:56.400
Oh...love this one.

22:59.040 --> 23:02.320
[Beats] Decoy, you still got
that Jamaican bandana?

23:04.760 --> 23:08.600
[Grindah] It's like slipping
into a warm bath, listening
to this shit, innit?

23:08.640 --> 23:12.120
"I'm sorry. You deserve better.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.800
I will never bother you again.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.560
Aldona."

23:21.320 --> 23:24.440
You know what? I'm starting
to wonder if maybe

23:24.480 --> 23:27.520
she was the person who stole
all of my stuff.

23:31.440 --> 23:35.200
Or maybe this is part of some
kind of role-playing game.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.920
And maybe she actually wants
me to hunt her down.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.480
And she put a kiss at the end
of the note, so maybe that's...

23:43.080 --> 23:45.360
No, that's crazy.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.400
I think it's actually
over for good now.

23:55.760 --> 23:59.320
Is it all right if we
leave it there? Yeah?

24:15.880 --> 24:17.920
Sick!

24:17.960 --> 24:20.960
Could someone get...?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.960
Someone get the door?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.640
Grindah! Can you get the...?

24:28.600 --> 24:32.040
-Hurry up.
-Why is the child lock on?

24:32.080 --> 24:34.960
It's this way, man.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.640
-This way, innit?
-Yeah.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.840
-Quite a low-key operation
this, innit?

24:43.320 --> 24:47.640
Obviously, you've got to wait
here, yeah? Cos it's bare
Yardies and that, so...

24:47.680 --> 24:51.840
-Man, they're not Yardies.
-Yardies, Rastas, whatever.

24:51.880 --> 24:55.680
Stop putting a label on
everything! It's gonna be sick.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.400
-Trust me on the reload.
-Done loads.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.040
[Grindah] Remember, it's
"Selassie I" when you enter.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.360
[Beats] Do you have to
bow or anything?

25:07.320 --> 25:10.520
They already look
a little bit healthier.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.760
That's just from...
less than a day

25:13.800 --> 25:16.360
under the old UV.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.160
Got a little tan as well.

25:19.200 --> 25:23.440
See that? It's like just
my arms have been on holiday...

25:24.640 --> 25:26.560
together.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.120
That's fucking shit!
You said they were Rastas!

25:29.160 --> 25:32.400
No, I didn't, mate. You just
assumed that. Anyway, they're
from my dad's side, man.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.400
-You should have said
they were white.
-What does that matter?

25:35.440 --> 25:40.400
He wasn't even listening to
reggae. He was listening to
rock music, for fuck's sake!

25:40.440 --> 25:43.160
Wasn't even close.

25:43.200 --> 25:47.040
Main thing is,
we reloaded though, innit?

25:47.080 --> 25:50.160
-[reggae plays]
-[Grindah] Turn that shit off!

25:50.200 --> 25:52.680
It's pointless now.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.920
[director]
Have you ever been to Jamaica?

25:56.960 --> 25:59.720
-Not in person.
-Well, no. Not in person.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.240
But in soul.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.120
<i>[both] In spirit.</i>

26:03.160 --> 26:07.080
<i>We bring that little bit
of Jamaica to Brentford.</i>

26:07.120 --> 26:11.840
So in that form, to us,
yeah, everywhere's Jamaica.

26:13.400 --> 26:16.400
Maybe we should
get our own UV lights,

26:16.440 --> 26:18.960
save going down
Miche's work.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.080
Nah! Wouldn't bother.
Drought's over, mate.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.320
Yeah, but what about
preparing for the future?

26:26.360 --> 26:28.480
-For next time?
-Nah.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.800
We'll be all right. We'll find
something, mate. We always do.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.080
I think we've just been
overthinking it too much.

26:35.120 --> 26:38.920
It's good to chill out.
Saves all that.

26:38.960 --> 26:44.680
[Beats] <i> We'll never stop</i>
<i>blazing ever, because</i>
<i>even if...</i>

26:44.720 --> 26:48.280
the world was to end,
flowers still grow.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.640
Do you know what I'm saying?

26:50.680 --> 26:54.080
-Them ones, they're
like metaphors.
-Like a rose from the concrete.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.680
Sounds like something
I'd come up with.

26:55.720 --> 26:58.680
I could chip in
for this, actually.

26:58.720 --> 27:02.200
Still got my tenner from
earlier that Chabuds paid me.

27:04.480 --> 27:07.120
[Grindah]
That's the way, innit?

27:08.840 --> 27:11.560
It's all dissolved
into the sock.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.000
Is it all right to still
blaze a little bit of it?

27:18.040 --> 27:22.360
-Yeah, we'll save you
a little bit at the end, mate.
-We'll leave you the roaches.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.120
Will they accept it
if it's like that?

27:25.160 --> 27:27.480
[all]
Yeah, it'll be fine, yeah.

27:28.305 --> 27:34.548
