20:20.001 --> 20:22.656
[grunting]

20:30.316 --> 20:32.274
[glass breaks]

20:33.014 --> 20:34.711
What the hell is this crap?

20:43.372 --> 20:47.594
[grunting]

20:49.944 --> 20:51.162
- [Voiceover] Hey.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.034
Hold on, I know you.

20:55.123 --> 20:57.299
Someone's looking
for your right?

20:59.127 --> 21:01.042
There's even a
bounty on you right?

21:02.043 --> 21:03.914
- How much?

21:06.352 --> 21:08.354
- 300,000 baht.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.877
- Is that a lot?

21:11.922 --> 21:13.184
- I got an idea.

21:13.228 --> 21:18.015
Hm, how about you pay me
more and I'll pretend I

21:18.059 --> 21:19.408
never saw you here.

21:21.018 --> 21:21.976
How bout that for a deal?

21:22.019 --> 21:23.282
- Lee said you had a big mouth.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.066
Bobby Pau.

21:25.109 --> 21:27.111
- Micheal Turner.

21:27.155 --> 21:30.027
[grunting]

21:34.554 --> 21:35.381
- Get down.

21:35.424 --> 21:36.991
- Please don't hurt me man.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.079
Listen to me.

21:39.515 --> 21:40.995
Now listen to me, tell
anyone who's looking for him

21:41.038 --> 21:43.040
Michael Turner is here waiting.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.086
You understand?

21:45.129 --> 21:48.045
- [mumbles]

21:53.050 --> 21:54.138
- I'm bait?

21:54.182 --> 21:56.053
- You chose to be bait.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.013
You're going home kid.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.014
- [Michael] Excuse me?

22:00.057 --> 22:01.450
- Draco has a hit out on you.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.234
- So do most the people in LA.

22:03.278 --> 22:05.062
- He's not just some
ordinary criminal.

22:05.106 --> 22:07.021
He's a connected warlord.

22:07.064 --> 22:09.240
- A warlord who's
a mass murderer.

22:09.284 --> 22:10.807
He needs to be stopped.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.941
- Look your in Bangkok,
Thailand you don't understand

22:13.984 --> 22:16.073
the language, you're out of
your jurisdiction, you're

22:16.117 --> 22:17.858
all alone.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.947
- No, Lee said that
you would help me.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.992
- Lee just wants you to
take out his dirty laundry.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.344
You're way out of your league
kid, you don't have a chance.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.562
- I don't need your help.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.477
That mother fucker
killed my partner,

22:28.521 --> 22:31.088
and I'm not just gonna sit here
and try to drink that away.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.140
- Micheal, wait up.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.273
For the damages.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.972
Okay, everybody out of here
now let's go, let's go.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.756
[gun shot]

22:46.800 --> 22:47.888
Everybody out.

22:47.931 --> 22:48.976
- What the hell are you doing?

22:49.019 --> 22:49.977
This is your plan?

22:50.020 --> 22:51.108
- We need information now.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.023
- Are you crazy or just drunk?

22:53.067 --> 22:55.025
- If I was sober I
wouldn't be doing this.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.070
Are you armed?

22:56.113 --> 22:58.115
- Yeah, yeah I got a gun.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.073
What now?

22:59.116 --> 23:00.944
- We wait.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.729
- I'll wait upstairs.

23:14.001 --> 23:18.048
[fast paced music]

23:52.082 --> 23:53.823
[gun shot]

23:53.867 --> 23:55.172
[screams]

24:03.006 --> 24:04.530
- You okay up there?

24:04.573 --> 24:05.095
- Clear!

24:18.544 --> 24:20.720
[grunts]

24:21.372 --> 24:23.244
- We'll need some supplies.

24:26.116 --> 24:29.250
- So the 68 million
dollar question.

24:31.078 --> 24:34.037
How do fucking American
agents come into my home

24:34.081 --> 24:35.691
and piss on my lawn?

24:37.084 --> 24:38.607
- How would I know?

24:38.999 --> 24:40.087
- Think harder.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.264
Two people escaped, one
come back, one doesn't.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.005
Why?

24:47.094 --> 24:48.965
- He's dead.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.097
I pushed him off a cliff.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.099
- Really, he's dead?

24:52.142 --> 24:54.231
So you went down and
double tapped him.

24:54.275 --> 24:55.711
Boom, boom.

24:56.146 --> 24:58.279
He's definitely
dead, done, done.

24:59.410 --> 25:00.847
Right?

25:02.892 --> 25:04.024
Is that right?

25:05.286 --> 25:06.940
Peter,

25:07.941 --> 25:09.899
is that right?

25:09.943 --> 25:11.074
Hm.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.946
- I'll be back shortly.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.217
[dial tone]

25:23.260 --> 25:24.087
- [Voiceover] Hello?

25:24.131 --> 25:26.046
- Otto, recon gear for three.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.265
Arms and rations for a week.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.833
We're pulling up now, come
down and help with the gear.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.835
- [Otto] Okay.

25:39.450 --> 25:41.452
- Michael this is Otto,
he'll be coming with us.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.150
- Michael Turner.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.066
[scoffs] We'll he's friendly.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.551
- Lee said you're FBI.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.291
Any experience
out in the jungle?

25:54.335 --> 25:56.032
- Just the concrete jungle.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.646
- Well, pay very close attention
to what I tell you because

26:00.689 --> 26:02.909
Draco's gonna be the least
of your worries if you can't

26:02.952 --> 26:04.388
survive out in the bush.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.347
- Don't worry about me.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.653
All I need you to do is get
me close enough so I can put

26:07.696 --> 26:09.219
a bullet in his head.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.484
- People get very reckless
when they're out for revenge.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.182
- Well don't act like you're
doing this out of the goodness

26:15.225 --> 26:16.487
of your heart.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.664
I know you want him
just as bad as I do.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.971
- He's a bad guy and
he's got to be stopped.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.975
Hey,

26:27.237 --> 26:28.978
wear this it'll
help you blend in.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.546
A little.

26:34.375 --> 26:36.377
- Hey who are these guys?

26:38.553 --> 26:40.033
- My friends.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.130
- Hey are you sure he can
handle one of those things?

26:51.871 --> 26:53.350
- Better than you.

26:53.394 --> 26:54.961
- I might not have a lot of
experience out in the bush

26:55.004 --> 26:57.224
but I know how to
handle a weapon.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.312
- Prove it.

26:58.355 --> 27:01.620
Otto, Beretta break
down assembly.

27:03.926 --> 27:04.927
Go.

27:05.319 --> 27:08.322
[fast paced music]

27:20.943 --> 27:21.901
You lose.

27:21.944 --> 27:22.945
- Yeah but can he shoot?

27:24.077 --> 27:24.991
- Otto.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.909
- Okay fine he can shoot.

27:29.952 --> 27:30.910
- Okay that's it then.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.955
Let's go.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.609
- But I'm taller.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.050
[up beat music]

28:06.859 --> 28:09.035
- Drugs and weapons can
come from any place.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.994
Conflict minerals,
blood, gold, sliver.

28:13.866 --> 28:17.957
They come from these mountains
or one of these two jungles.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.785
- Which one?

28:19.828 --> 28:21.003
- Don't know.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.222
They both run along the
Thai Burmese border.

28:23.963 --> 28:27.575
Best thing to do is go here
and see what the locals

28:27.618 --> 28:28.837
have to say.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.012
- And what if they
don't know anything?

28:30.056 --> 28:32.319
- Oh they'll know,
but they may not say.

28:35.104 --> 28:38.020
Deeper we go, the more
control Draco has over them.

28:38.064 --> 28:39.848
- They're afraid?

28:39.892 --> 28:41.110
- Yeah, hell when Turner
clicks out and I'm afraid.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.592
- Conrad used to say
that courage is in
the absence of fear.

28:44.635 --> 28:45.985
And it's just the
ability to overcome it.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.987
- Overcome it for
the right reasons.

28:48.988 --> 28:49.989
Are you afraid?

28:50.990 --> 28:51.991
- No.

28:53.209 --> 28:55.211
- Then you're either
stupid or you're a liar.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.735
- Try pissed.

28:57.997 --> 28:58.998
- Stupid.

29:00.477 --> 29:03.002
So what makes this guy so
important to get for you?

29:06.179 --> 29:07.571
- Conrad was like
a farther to me.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.226
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for him.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.968
He chased Darco around
the world for 15 years.

29:15.579 --> 29:16.972
He just wouldn't retire
unless he caught him.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.193
- I could understand
that feeling.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.805
So he just couldn't let go.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.721
Sound familiar?

29:40.953 --> 29:42.824
- This place is amazing.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.347
Much nicer than Bangkok.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.002
- Enjoy it now kid
'cause where we're going,

29:47.046 --> 29:48.395
is no vacation.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.549
Well this is the
end of the road.

30:12.593 --> 30:13.899
Jump off point.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.249
- You're kidding me?

30:16.292 --> 30:18.077
- What's a matter, never
humped a rock before?

30:19.992 --> 30:21.602
- We're in the
middle of nowhere.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.996
- Well where would you hide
your illegal mining operation?

30:25.040 --> 30:26.999
Stay close, keep your eyes open.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.957
Keep your gear tight.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.437
- And what's wrong
with the Jeep?

30:30.480 --> 30:32.091
- Well Draco probably has
men scattered throughout this

30:32.134 --> 30:35.616
entire region, stay off the
road and out of enemies sight.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.010
- Right.

30:42.928 --> 30:46.279
[slow music]

31:13.915 --> 31:15.612
- Conserve the water.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.049
Still got a long way to go.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.053
- God damn it.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.055
Looks lovely.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.883
- That's because
you smell like shit.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.451
[dramatic music]

31:29.975 --> 31:32.891
[bird cawing]

32:06.011 --> 32:09.536
[sword wacking]

32:14.280 --> 32:15.977
Hold up, hold up.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.283
Rest.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.024
Take a rest.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.567
- Otto.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.920
Your boss, he drinks huh?

32:50.316 --> 32:52.318
Did something happen to him?

32:58.324 --> 33:00.239
- Okay let's go.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.294
[grunts]

33:12.338 --> 33:13.948
- What's wrong?

33:13.992 --> 33:15.297
What happened?

33:15.341 --> 33:17.256
Damn it, I told you to
keep your gear tight.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.259
Centipede, we got to go now.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.089
We got less than an hour
to get you the antidote.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.047
- Or what, I die?

33:26.091 --> 33:27.396
- If you're lucky.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.007
There's a village
hospital two clicks up.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.457
[heavy breathing]

34:24.149 --> 34:25.976
- What happened?

34:26.020 --> 34:27.326
- You've been poisoned.

34:51.654 --> 34:55.049
[distant chatter]

35:06.887 --> 35:09.237
[foreign language]

35:21.075 --> 35:23.033
- Look I'm very sorry about
that but we're here on official

35:23.077 --> 35:24.252
business.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.994
[foreign language]

35:31.085 --> 35:33.174
She wants to know if
we're here to help.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.002
- Help how?

35:35.568 --> 35:38.005
- They have sick and injured,
are we here to help them.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.399
- That's not really
what we're here for.

35:41.226 --> 35:42.966
No doctor.

35:43.010 --> 35:45.055
How did she get all the
way out here anyway?

35:45.099 --> 35:47.145
[foreign language]

35:54.064 --> 35:56.937
- She says feel free
to take one and leave.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.982
- What was that all about?

35:59.026 --> 36:01.898
- It's not just us, this
village is overrun with refugees

36:01.942 --> 36:03.639
and no one will help them.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.906
- Look just tell her
that we need to gather

36:09.950 --> 36:11.212
some intelligence.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.911
[foreign language]

36:14.955 --> 36:16.957
- You're showing very
little intelligence now.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.915
- She didn't say that.

36:18.959 --> 36:19.960
- Yes I did.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.875
- Am I out of line here?

36:21.918 --> 36:23.050
- What do you want?

36:23.093 --> 36:24.704
- Draco.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.271
A man named Draco.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.056
[foreign language]

36:29.099 --> 36:30.927
- She has to work.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.233
- If she understands what
I'm saying how come you're

36:32.277 --> 36:33.713
translating?

36:33.756 --> 36:36.281
[foreign language]

36:36.324 --> 36:37.934
I'm standing right here.

36:37.978 --> 36:39.284
- She doesn't want
to talk to you.

36:50.295 --> 36:53.123
[foreign language]

36:54.168 --> 36:56.126
No one can help us with Draco.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.998
We need doctors not warriors.

36:58.999 --> 37:01.001
- Fighting makes
everything worse.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.004
And who pays?

37:04.047 --> 37:05.962
The local villages.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.051
All are hungry.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.966
Many are damaged.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.664
- Wounded.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.970
- This is Mya, wounded.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.190
- What happened to him?

37:16.234 --> 37:18.061
- A miracle.

37:18.105 --> 37:20.499
Draco's men left him
for dead in the river.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.850
The current magically
carried him to shore.

37:32.032 --> 37:34.252
Mya is kid from
Draco's compound.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.689
His woman was not so lucky.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.343
- Wait a second.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.040
That guy knows where
Draco's camp is?

37:40.997 --> 37:42.738
We got to question him.

37:43.043 --> 37:46.002
[foreign language]

37:46.394 --> 37:48.091
What, what is she saying?

37:48.135 --> 37:50.006
- He's unconscious.

38:01.844 --> 38:04.194
Let it go, it's just a dead end.

38:04.238 --> 38:05.805
- We should be questioning him.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.328
We're wasting time.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.896
- Look, being an asshole is
no way to get these people

38:09.939 --> 38:10.940
to help us.

38:10.984 --> 38:13.029
We need them to get to Maya.

38:13.073 --> 38:14.988
Let's just do this there way.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.824
[water running]

38:34.007 --> 38:35.922
- Hey!

38:35.965 --> 38:37.967
You find anything over there?

38:48.282 --> 38:52.982
[slow music]

38:55.289 --> 38:57.030
- I thought this was supposed
to be a refugee camp,

38:57.073 --> 38:58.510
what are they celebrating?

38:58.945 --> 39:01.904
- This is a typical Buddhist
festival for this region.

39:01.948 --> 39:03.297
Relax and enjoy it.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.958

straight, he knows how to put

39:30.106 --> 39:32.979
together glocks, move through
the jungle and dance like

39:33.022 --> 39:34.981
Timberlake?

39:36.112 --> 39:37.287
- Otto's very talented.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.986
He was Thai military,
was one of the best.

39:40.290 --> 39:42.249
And [chuckles] he can dance.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.123
- Whoa.

39:48.603 --> 39:49.996
- You know they've been
planning this party for a while.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.087
[drum beat]

39:58.874 --> 40:02.661
[chanting]

40:32.038 --> 40:34.693
There are many marital art
moves hidden in her dance.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.046
- It's amazing.

40:56.584 --> 40:59.152
[applause]

41:12.078 --> 41:15.385
[delightful music]

41:50.420 --> 41:54.729
- Guys, he'll be in the
village hospital just up ahead,

41:55.077 --> 41:57.906
and remember Draco said no guns.

42:01.823 --> 42:03.956
[ominous music]

that I know in Thai.

44:08.254 --> 44:10.256
Can I help you with something?

44:11.083 --> 44:13.955
I might not be a doctor
but I'm a good help.

50:25.283 --> 50:26.980
- Are you okay?

50:27.024 --> 50:30.027
- I'm fine, my dearest Sargent
father taught me to fight.

50:45.129 --> 50:47.261
[foreign language]

50:47.305 --> 50:49.089
- He talks?

50:49.133 --> 50:50.569
What'd he say?

50:50.612 --> 50:52.005
- Don't worry, it was good.

50:52.049 --> 50:53.267
You impressed him.

50:53.311 --> 50:55.008
- Well he shouldn't
be that impressed.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.054
They killed Private Mya,
we were right there.

50:57.097 --> 50:59.578
He was the only one that
knew the way to Draco's camp.

51:02.320 --> 51:05.584
- From Private Mya, he
told me it was from the

51:05.627 --> 51:07.020
Nelse mountains.

51:11.503 --> 51:14.071
We are going to Draco's camp.

51:14.114 --> 51:16.073
- No it's too dangerous.

51:16.116 --> 51:19.772
- Dangerous is living
in a world with Draco.

51:23.036 --> 51:25.256
Only I know the way.

51:28.302 --> 51:32.089
[dramatic music]

51:54.154 --> 51:55.677
- Stop!

51:55.721 --> 51:57.070
- What was that?

52:04.904 --> 52:06.601
- Bermey's landmine.

52:07.515 --> 52:09.126
Damn it I didn't think
they'd be out this far.

52:10.997 --> 52:12.564
It's pressure sensitive.

52:14.131 --> 52:16.916
You have to keep
your foot on it.

52:20.702 --> 52:24.358
[fast paced music]

52:28.362 --> 52:30.016
- Trust me.

52:53.039 --> 52:56.434

52:57.043 --> 52:59.045
He's said that before,
what does that mean?

53:01.874 --> 53:03.919
Will you just tell
me, I might die.

53:03.963 --> 53:05.225
- You're not gonna die.

53:05.269 --> 53:05.921
- What are you doing?

53:05.965 --> 53:07.140
- Think positive.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.576
- You can't disarm a
bomb from back there.

53:08.620 --> 53:10.926
- [foreign language]
Tiger white.

53:10.970 --> 53:12.101
- What?

53:12.145 --> 53:14.060
- White tiger.

53:14.103 --> 53:16.280
Sometimes it takes a stubborn
tiger like you to get a

53:16.323 --> 53:18.282
reluctant lion like me to fight.

53:22.982 --> 53:24.375
And you're white.

53:24.418 --> 53:26.115
- Bobby no!

53:27.291 --> 53:29.336
[explosion sound]

53:38.040 --> 53:39.955
Thanks man.

53:40.565 --> 53:42.001
- You owe me.

53:45.004 --> 53:47.006
[foreign language]

53:47.049 --> 53:49.008
- What'd he say.

53:49.051 --> 53:50.270
- Stupid lion.

53:50.879 --> 53:52.272
- Stupid tiger.

54:08.984 --> 54:12.336
[slow music]

54:37.883 --> 54:39.014
- [sighs] Time to rest.

54:39.058 --> 54:41.016
We will camp here for the night.

54:41.365 --> 54:43.062
- How much further
to Draco's camp?

54:44.063 --> 54:46.065
- Very close, two kilometers.

54:48.023 --> 54:49.895
- I'm gonna check the perimeter.

54:50.765 --> 54:52.027
Otto.

54:58.033 --> 55:00.035
- You are very brave.

55:00.949 --> 55:02.777
- You're the one that's brave.

55:02.821 --> 55:04.649
You've been dealing with
Draco longer than any of us.

55:11.090 --> 55:13.266
- This will bring you luck.

55:15.094 --> 55:18.532
It was my fathers, it keep
him safe in the combat.

55:19.098 --> 55:20.882
- Thank you.

55:38.073 --> 55:39.684
Hey you okay?

55:40.772 --> 55:42.991
- This was a lot easier
when I was your age.

55:43.992 --> 55:46.995
- Well it doesn't look like
it slowed you down much.

55:49.041 --> 55:50.085
Thanks man.

55:51.348 --> 55:52.392
Never would have made
it this far without you.

55:52.436 --> 55:55.047
- You still got
a long way to go.

56:02.315 --> 56:05.405
- You ever consider
drinking less?

56:05.449 --> 56:07.886
- Now why would I
want to do that?

56:09.975 --> 56:11.716
- Can't drown your past.

56:14.022 --> 56:15.937
- You're right.

56:15.981 --> 56:17.852
Drunk or sober.

56:19.985 --> 56:21.595
I can still hear
my men screaming.

56:24.337 --> 56:26.992
I led my men on a
black op to find Draco.

56:28.602 --> 56:31.344
Trouble with the black
operation is somebody finds out,

56:32.127 --> 56:33.868
it's not black anymore.

56:41.876 --> 56:43.530
Draco was waiting for us.

56:45.010 --> 56:47.621
We were captured, tortured.

56:50.276 --> 56:51.538
Killed.

56:52.670 --> 56:54.367
Everyone except me that is.

56:56.021 --> 56:57.501
- It's not your fault.

56:58.632 --> 57:00.068
- Who says?

57:00.939 --> 57:02.810
Listening to your own men?

57:02.854 --> 57:04.943

57:12.037 --> 57:14.518
This flask belong to Sawat.

57:15.954 --> 57:18.870
He was 21 years old,
just got married.

57:20.088 --> 57:22.047
Was looking forward
to starting a family.

57:30.838 --> 57:32.057
- Water?

57:33.537 --> 57:34.929
- I quite drinking when I
realized we might actually be

57:34.973 --> 57:36.278
able to get Draco.

57:36.975 --> 57:38.977
Without you, both of you.

57:39.978 --> 57:42.110
I would have never
attempted this.

57:45.070 --> 57:46.985
So thank you Michael.

57:47.986 --> 57:49.074

58:18.320 --> 58:19.931

58:20.627 --> 58:23.021
- Highly skilled mercenary's
who used to be part of the

58:23.064 --> 58:24.588
Bermey's Army.

58:24.631 --> 58:25.893
- Let's.

58:26.938 --> 58:29.331
- Draco is holding
many refugees.

58:32.944 --> 58:35.120
- Jesus they're not
refugees, they're slaves.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.473
- What's the plan?

58:40.517 --> 58:42.823
- Michael and I will attack
the combat from both sides,

58:42.867 --> 58:44.521
provide a distraction.

58:44.564 --> 58:47.001
When they take the bait, you
sneak in as quickly as you can

58:47.045 --> 58:49.961
and release the refugees
out into the jungle.

58:50.657 --> 58:52.224
- Then what?

58:52.267 --> 58:56.794
- Then you and I go in, kill
Draco, try to get out of here

58:56.837 --> 58:58.622
without getting
ourselves killed.

58:59.971 --> 59:01.625
- Sounds like fun.

59:09.502 --> 59:10.982
- Be careful.

59:11.939 --> 59:13.027
- You too.

or the girl dies.

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.322
- Are there more?

01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:51.245
Are there more?

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:52.681
- Let her go.

01:02:57.034 --> 01:03:01.038
- Mr. Turner, there are only
two things I care about.

01:03:02.039 --> 01:03:04.084
Money and power.

01:03:06.086 --> 01:03:09.046
You have been playing
with my money,

01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:12.092
I will not let you
play with my power.

01:03:13.267 --> 01:03:18.272
So for the last time, are
there more of you out there?

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:20.971

01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:28.369
- Let's go to the mine.

01:03:28.413 --> 01:03:31.024
Grab as much gold as
we can and disappear.

01:03:33.984 --> 01:03:36.029
- What about her?

01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:37.988
- She'll come with me.

01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:42.644
Valerie in the back,
you stay with me.

01:03:47.084 --> 01:03:48.999

Are you okay?

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:04.030
Looks like that's two I owe you.

01:05:04.857 --> 01:05:06.206
- You lucky bastard.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:07.512

01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:18.566

[gun shots]

01:10:10.162 --> 01:10:11.032
- Look out!

01:10:11.076 --> 01:10:12.860
[explosion]

01:10:41.976 --> 01:10:43.891
- Hey, hurry up.

01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:47.982
[gun shots]

01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:56.991
- Let's go, come on, come on.

01:10:57.035 --> 01:11:00.952
Hurry up, Han go, put
everything in the truck.

01:11:00.995 --> 01:11:02.345
We have to pack.

01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:09.003
[gun shots]

01:11:18.012 --> 01:11:20.014

01:11:23.017 --> 01:11:25.542
[grunting]

01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:49.043
[gun shot]

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:08.715
What was that?

01:12:08.759 --> 01:12:10.021
You two, in the truck.

01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:13.024
Valerie, Peter take some
men and hold them off.

01:12:13.938 --> 01:12:15.505
- Boss we're getting fucking
hit hard over there, we need

01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:16.984
more men.

01:12:17.028 --> 01:12:18.508
- Come on, go on.

01:12:18.551 --> 01:12:20.074
And this time don't fuck up.

01:12:20.988 --> 01:12:22.294
Go, go, go.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.954
- Which way?

01:12:29.997 --> 01:12:31.303
- We have to split up.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:37.962
- Where's Draco?

01:12:38.005 --> 01:12:41.966
[grunting]

01:13:01.289 --> 01:13:04.597
[fast paced music]

01:13:34.148 --> 01:13:36.629
[gun shot]

01:13:50.382 --> 01:13:51.992
- Hold it!

01:13:52.036 --> 01:13:54.299
Put your hands up.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.962
Too bad about your little man.

01:14:05.266 --> 01:14:07.399
He put up quite a fight.

01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:10.054
Drop it!

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:12.012
I said drop it.

01:14:21.979 --> 01:14:24.242
- Come on, let's go tonight.

01:14:27.027 --> 01:14:30.074
[grunting]

01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:03.950

[grunting]

01:17:29.514 --> 01:17:31.255
- You wouldn't.

01:18:01.067 --> 01:18:02.982
- Michael.

01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:04.549
Where's Draco?

01:18:04.592 --> 01:18:06.203
- I don't know.

01:18:06.246 --> 01:18:07.944
There's only one way left to go.

01:18:15.821 --> 01:18:17.693
[gun shots]

01:18:17.954 --> 01:18:21.000
- Wait, wait, wait,
give me your weapon.

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:22.959
- What?

01:18:24.525 --> 01:18:26.092
- No time for questions.

01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:33.099
[fast paced music]

01:18:55.992 --> 01:18:59.256
[gun shots]

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.650
- You want to fight?

01:19:09.919 --> 01:19:11.181
Come at me?

01:19:11.224 --> 01:19:14.010
I am Draco, you want
a slice of this?

01:19:15.925 --> 01:19:18.928
Mother fucker come
on, you want more huh?

01:19:22.018 --> 01:19:24.063
[screams]

01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:26.979
[gun shots]

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.177
- Draco!

01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:52.178
Give it up.

01:19:52.222 --> 01:19:52.918
It's over.

01:19:52.962 --> 01:19:54.311
- No Draco, Draco wins.

01:19:54.354 --> 01:19:55.965
- Drop your weapon.

01:19:56.748 --> 01:19:58.837
- You will never win!

01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.883
[gun shots]

01:20:09.761 --> 01:20:11.067
- I'm out.

01:20:12.982 --> 01:20:14.418
- So.

01:20:15.027 --> 01:20:17.073
- It's jammed.

01:20:17.116 --> 01:20:18.944
- No more bullets.

01:20:18.988 --> 01:20:20.946
You want to kill Draco huh?

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:23.035
Huh?

01:20:23.993 --> 01:20:25.995
[gun shots]

01:20:54.023 --> 01:20:58.027
[slow music]

01:21:31.364 --> 01:21:33.236
- I thought you were dead.

01:21:33.279 --> 01:21:34.454
- No.

01:21:34.977 --> 01:21:36.369
Thanks to you.

01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:38.458
Let's get out of here.

01:21:42.462 --> 01:21:46.075
[slow music]

01:22:17.541 --> 01:22:19.978
- Otto didn't have a long
life but he lived it to

01:22:20.022 --> 01:22:21.023
the fullest.

01:22:23.895 --> 01:22:26.376
So, what about you?

01:22:26.419 --> 01:22:28.030
Back to the states?

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:30.467
- I don't know.

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:31.729
I don't think I'm gonna
receive a warm welcome when

01:22:31.772 --> 01:22:33.078
I get back to the agency.

01:22:34.601 --> 01:22:36.995
- Well maybe there's something
right here you could do.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:38.997
- I don't think
I'm read to be your

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:40.303
mercenary partner either.

01:22:41.086 --> 01:22:43.219
- I wasn't thinking
about mercenary.

01:22:43.262 --> 01:22:45.221
Was thinking about something
more along the lines of

01:22:45.264 --> 01:22:46.483
the medical field.

01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:51.009
Well look if it doesn't
work out, you know where

01:22:51.053 --> 01:22:52.576
to find me.

01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:55.013
- No I don't.

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:58.060
- Then I'll find you.

01:23:19.081 --> 01:23:24.042
[up beat music]

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:57.902
[foreign language]

01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:04.082
I almost forgot to
give this back to you.

01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:06.998
It brought me luck.

01:24:12.308 --> 01:24:13.874
[foreign language]

01:24:22.231 --> 01:24:25.930
[children mumbling]

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:41.032
