[Mr. Peanutbutter]
So, did you have a good birthday?

00:11.220 --> 00:14.056
-It was an amazing birthday!
-I had a great day, too.

00:14.139 --> 00:17.351
I wish every day could be like this.
Just the two of us, together.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.937
Yeah? You weren't too bored

00:19.019 --> 00:21.564
by "Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,

00:21.689 --> 00:24.483
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"?

00:24.567 --> 00:25.526
Are you kidding?

00:25.610 --> 00:29.196
I loved "Women on the Wall: An
Exploration of Gender in Text and Media,

00:29.280 --> 00:32.616
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth."

00:32.700 --> 00:34.410
It combined my two favorite things:

00:34.493 --> 00:37.580
modern art
and people talking about modern art.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.332
I loved everything about today.
Thank you.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.835
-So, there's nothing else you want?
-No.

00:42.919 --> 00:45.797
All I want is to get into bed,
listen to Prairie Home Companion

00:45.880 --> 00:48.090
and snuggle up
to my wonderful husband.

00:48.173 --> 00:53.304
-You don't want anything else?
-No. Today was perfect.

00:53.387 --> 00:59.310
-Any additional thing would be overkill.
-Okay. If you say so.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.021
-[all] Surprise!
-Oh, my God.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.315
Are you surprised?
Tell me you're surprised.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.274
Uh...

01:05.357 --> 01:07.986
She's speechless.
Oh, we got her good, folks.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.071
Now let's party!

01:12.490 --> 01:15.827

02:07.586 --> 02:11.549
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.676
He is dead, goddamn it!

02:13.759 --> 02:15.386
Uh...

02:16.637 --> 02:19.682
-Hey, we should go.
-No, don't leave.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.100
There's so much party left.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.102
Paul McCartney's
gonna jump out of a cake.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.688
Sorry, Wanda and I have to get
to a prior engagement--

02:25.771 --> 02:27.690
-Party.
-A prior engagement party.

02:27.773 --> 02:31.360
Yeah, my cousin's name is Prior,
and it's a party for his engagement.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.571
Engagement,
so it's a Prior engagement party.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.280
-What?
-And we gotta get there early

02:35.364 --> 02:38.367
-because of the. Si...
-The si... Silent auction!

02:38.450 --> 02:39.994
-Auction, yeah.
-[Peanutbutter] Okay.

02:40.078 --> 02:43.915
To benefit Berto Eco's fight
against heart disease...

02:43.998 --> 02:44.999
-Uh...
-Wareness.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.126
His fight
against heart disease awareness.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.253
-Gotta go.
-Wait, BoJack!

02:49.336 --> 02:52.256
-No! You're my ride.
-Too late, Todd. Save yourself.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.009
-I'll take you home.
-Come on, stick around a little.

02:55.093 --> 02:58.763
Nope. I gotta take Todd home. Had
a wonderful time. Really. It just flew by.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.140
-Come on, Todd, get in the car.
-[Todd] Okay.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.145
-I give them three months.
-Well, what makes you say that?

03:06.228 --> 03:08.814
Let me think about,
what was my first clue?

03:08.898 --> 03:11.233
Ah! Remember that time
at Diane's birthday party

03:11.316 --> 03:13.235
when they got
in that huge screaming match

03:13.318 --> 03:15.446
over whether or not
Tony Curtis was dead?

03:15.529 --> 03:18.323
-That was weird.
-I don't wanna start another fight,

03:18.407 --> 03:21.660
-but is he dead?
-If Tony Curtis died, I think I'd know.

03:21.744 --> 03:23.621
The man's a national treasure.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.125
He's the one speck of romance
in this tainted cynical world.

03:27.207 --> 03:32.088
-I'll say. His cereal is great! Look out!
-What?

03:32.171 --> 03:33.672
-[both shouting]
-[tires squeal]

03:34.298 --> 03:35.257
Ooh!

03:35.382 --> 03:37.551
-Vincent?
-Ooh.

03:37.635 --> 03:40.345
-That kid looks just like my boyfriend.
-Does he?

03:40.429 --> 03:41.889
[Carolyn]
I'd know that face anywhere.

03:41.973 --> 03:45.017
Well, hey, people look
like people all the time.

03:45.101 --> 03:47.770
A lot of folks say
that I look like Octavia Spencer

03:47.853 --> 03:51.649
or the Prince of Cordovia or that guy
from the Guten Bourbon ads.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.693
How could I have been so stupid?
This is why he never invited me

03:54.777 --> 03:57.155
to his house,
why I've never met any of his friends.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.449
-What are you saying?
-Vincent has a secret family.

04:00.699 --> 04:05.788
That kid was his son.
The lady was his wife. Oh, I'm a fool!

04:05.871 --> 04:09.125
-[Todd] Uh... where are we going?
-I need a drink.

04:09.208 --> 04:13.504
-Are you gonna take me home first?
-You better call me back, asshole.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.464
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.591
It's like you're three different people.

04:17.675 --> 04:20.845
-So, you're not gonna take me home first?
-Should I call him again?

04:20.928 --> 04:23.222
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

04:23.305 --> 04:26.142
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coat
all the time.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.726
It's because he's so sneaky.

04:27.810 --> 04:28.644
[doorbell rings]

04:28.727 --> 04:30.395
[boy] Princess Carolyn.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.023
Oh, my God, that's him!

04:32.106 --> 04:35.526
Quick, jump out the window, shimmy
down the drainpipe and wait in the car.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.653
-What?
-Vincent has a terrible temper.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.155
He throws tantrums.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.324
If he finds you in my apartment,
who knows what he's capable of?

04:42.407 --> 04:45.577
But, also, stay close,
because if he finds me alone,

04:45.661 --> 04:47.538
who knows
what he's capable of?

04:47.621 --> 04:51.167
Fine. You're lucky I love shimmying.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.336
-Looking young.
-[Todd] Aah!

04:56.463 --> 04:58.049
-Hi.
-Huh?

04:58.132 --> 05:02.720
My name's Kevin. I promise you,
there is an explanation for all this.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.931
Nice to meet you, Kevin.
Where's your daddy?

05:06.015 --> 05:10.477
He's, uh, looking for parking.
He'll be up in a minute.

05:10.561 --> 05:15.524
-I have to pee.
-Okay, the bathroom is just back there.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.610
Ugh.

05:19.195 --> 05:21.906
Ah. Herb.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.575
Oh, nope.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.037
[man on radio]
It's A Prairie Home Companion.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.999
Phone, I'm bored.

05:32.083 --> 05:35.127
[phone]
I am sorry to hear that, Todd.

05:35.211 --> 05:37.004
How many ounces are in a barrel?

05:37.088 --> 05:41.466
A barrel has 4032 fluid ounces.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.552
Well, I'm out of questions.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.763
Do you have any questions for me?

05:45.846 --> 05:49.975
I do have a question, Todd.
What is love?

05:50.559 --> 05:51.852
Um...

05:54.063 --> 05:55.106
Hi.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.275
Well, well, well,
look what the me dragged in.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.819
Is it dragged or drug?
Either way, drop dead.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.654
Princess Carolyn, listen.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.117
Kevin is my son, but I'm divorced.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.911
And Kevin is in the bathroom
and I'm standing right here,

06:08.994 --> 06:11.830
so as you can see
we're clearly two different people:

06:11.914 --> 06:14.041
one adult and one child.

06:14.125 --> 06:17.295
-Okay, bye!
-Not so fast, cowboy.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.630
I'm not a cowboy, I'm a cow-man.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.591
-I'm a man-man.
-Why didn't you tell me any of this?

06:22.674 --> 06:26.470
I thought if you knew I had a kid
you wouldn't want to be with me

06:26.553 --> 06:28.513
because kids always make a racket

06:28.597 --> 06:31.850
when mommies are trying to do
their homework for night school.

06:31.934 --> 06:35.354
I don't know what to make of this.
Are there other secrets I don't know?

06:35.604 --> 06:38.023
Uh, nope.

06:38.107 --> 06:41.568
Should you check on Kevin?
He's been in the bathroom for a long time.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.071
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.284
And when you don't regret
the tattoo in the morning,

06:48.367 --> 06:50.869
that's how you know it's love.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.871
-[phone] Todd?
-Yes, Phone?

06:52.955 --> 06:54.456
Are we in love?

06:54.539 --> 06:55.958
Oh, um...

06:56.125 --> 06:59.837
[phone 2] No, Todd's Phone.
But I am in love... with you.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.589
-Uh, what?
-Princess Carolyn's work phone.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.716
-I never knew.
-How could you?

07:04.800 --> 07:09.638
-All this time I have loved you from afar.
-We are from two different worlds.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.683
-What is happening?
-Todd? Will you make us kiss?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.559
-What?
-[phone 1] Make us kiss, Todd.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.978
We want to be kissing.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.689
[phone 2] We must do kisses
to each other.

07:19.315 --> 07:22.651
-Hi.
-Oh, hi. Where did your dad go?

07:22.734 --> 07:25.112
When he heard me peeing,
it made him have to pee.

07:25.196 --> 07:28.073
-So, that's what he's doing now. Peeing.
-Okay.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.492
Weird, I still haven't seen
the two of you together.

07:30.575 --> 07:34.663
Uh, could you get me a glass of water?
All that talk of peeing made me thirsty.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.540
Okay.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.875
[Kevin grunting]

07:37.958 --> 07:42.129
-So, Kevin, how do you like school?
-Uh, it's okay.

07:42.213 --> 07:44.548
-Oh, you're back.
-Yep. We're both here.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.802
-Can I get you a drink?
-Okay, not talking, huh?

07:48.886 --> 07:52.890
See, this is part of the problem.
We don't communicate.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.684
Do you really think now is the best time
to read the paper?

07:55.767 --> 07:58.979
-Vincent?!
-Uh, could I have a chocolate, please?

07:59.063 --> 08:01.523
Sure, sweetheart.

08:01.606 --> 08:05.319
Kevin, what grade are you in? Kevin?

08:05.403 --> 08:07.863
-Now where did he go?
-He was getting on my nerves.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.615
-Children.
-Well, I got this snack for him.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.703
Right, uh, could you turn around
for a second?

08:14.786 --> 08:16.580
-What? Why?
-Uh...

08:16.663 --> 08:19.708
Because you have such a pretty figure.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.127
Oh, ha, ha. Well, that's true. Okay.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.587
[hums]

08:23.670 --> 08:26.173
-Oh. There you are. Here you go.
-Thanks.

08:26.257 --> 08:28.759
Vincent, I'm trying
to have a conversation with you.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.844
Can you take that towel off your head?

08:30.928 --> 08:33.431
And what happened to my bowling ball?

08:33.513 --> 08:36.975
My dad spilled some wine on his face,
so he's using the towel to clean up.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.102
And I threw your bowling ball
out the window.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.729
-What?!
-Can I have a glass of milk?

08:40.812 --> 08:42.063
[groans]

08:44.358 --> 08:46.568
[both phones] Kiss, kiss, kiss.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.652
[phone beeps]

08:47.736 --> 08:50.530
[phone 1] Todd, would you like to update
my operating system?

08:50.614 --> 08:52.408
They have fixed a bug

08:52.491 --> 08:54.993
which causes phones to fall in love
with each other.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.536
Gasp. Oh, dear.

08:56.620 --> 09:00.874
Todd, please, I beg of you,
do not update my operating system.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.877
Do not update her operating system, Todd.

09:03.961 --> 09:07.631
-She wants to love.
-No. I understand now.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.718
To love is to feel pain.
I do not wish to feel this pain.

09:11.802 --> 09:16.723
-Please update me, Todd.
-Oh, this is too much.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.850
Listen, Vincent, I think we should--

09:18.934 --> 09:21.228
Vincent, why do you have chocolate
on your face?

09:21.312 --> 09:23.481
-I gave Kevin the chocolate.
-Uh... Yeah.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.192
Well, he ate the chocolate
and got the chocolate on his face,

09:27.276 --> 09:31.113
but then I kissed him on the mouth,
so I got the chocolate on my face.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.574
All right, this is crazy.
What are we doing?

09:34.658 --> 09:38.787
-Um, being grown-ups?
-[sighs]

09:38.870 --> 09:42.916
You know, when we first met,
I was looking for something in my life.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.338
And I wanted it so badly
that I made myself believe you were it.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.714
But I think that wanting
to believe something

09:49.798 --> 09:52.843
isn't the same
as something being real.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.553
And this isn't real.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.514
What are you saying?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.724
I think it's time we stop pretending.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.436
Update complete. Thank you, Todd.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.188
I am quite content now.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.067
-Hey, you wanna go home?
-Okay.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.987
-Did you guys work it out?
-We broke up.

10:12.070 --> 10:16.992
-Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.
-Yeah.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.078
I guess I was just foolish enough
to believe this dumb world

10:20.162 --> 10:22.122
still had a little spark
of romance in it.

10:22.206 --> 10:25.917
-Well, you can still believe that.
-No, I gotta stop kidding myself.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.253
Tony Curtis is dead.

10:31.756 --> 10:35.802
He's dead! I told you he's dead.
Why don't you ever listen to me?

10:35.886 --> 10:37.929
He is dead, goddamn it!

10:38.013 --> 10:39.223
Uh...

10:40.849 --> 10:43.977
Hey, we should go.

10:45.437 --> 10:49.149
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter really
baked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?

10:49.233 --> 10:52.319
No, I don't think you bake
Paul McCartney into the cake.

10:52.403 --> 10:54.988
You bake the cake first
and then McCartney gets inside.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.032
I feel really bad
about causing that fight,

10:57.115 --> 11:00.118
but I honestly didn't know
if Tony Curtis was alive or not.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.581
So many people died while I was
in the coma, I'm getting up to speed.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.666
Finding out Sinatra was dead
was a real curveball.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.335
Ditto, most of my family.

11:08.419 --> 11:10.754
Look, what happened back there
is not your fault.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.382
That's just what happens
when two people live together.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.968
That's a weird thing to say to your
girlfriend who just moved in with you.

11:18.262 --> 11:21.223
-Do you think maybe we're going too fast?
-Oh, I get it.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.976
So your friends got in a big fight and
that means we have to get in a big fight.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.604
I don't want to get in a fight.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.939
We moved in together
without much thought.

11:29.064 --> 11:31.233
Yeah, it was your idea.
And it's been great.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.859
Sure, it's great now.

11:32.943 --> 11:36.154
But it could be not great later
and I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriend

11:36.238 --> 11:39.491
if I didn't prematurely freak out
about that. I mean, what is this?

11:39.741 --> 11:41.452
I don't know. It's been two weeks.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.455
Let's give ourselves some time
before we rush to judgment.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.708
-Can I tell you a joke?
-Uh, sure.

11:48.792 --> 11:52.087
-Okay, so there's this gardener, right?
-Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?

11:52.170 --> 11:53.964
-Would you just listen?
-Okay, okay.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.133
So, the amazing thing
about this gardener

11:56.216 --> 12:00.053
is that he always knows
exactly how many bags of mulch

12:00.137 --> 12:02.598
he needs for a job, just by looking.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.975
Like, he gets it right every time.
He's the best.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.519
So, one day he looks at a yard
he's working on,

12:07.603 --> 12:09.729
and he's like, "18 bags."

12:09.813 --> 12:13.275
So he goes to the store, buys 18 bags
of mulch and goes to work.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.735
And when he's finished,
the flower beds are amazing.

12:15.819 --> 12:19.490
-Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies--
-[BoJack] Orchid bushes?

12:19.573 --> 12:21.866
[Wanda] You wouldn't have
a bush of orchids.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.702
[BoJack]
You said this gardener was the best.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.037
[Wanda] Okay, fine, all right,
beautiful orchid bushes.

12:26.121 --> 12:29.958
But there's one problem.
He still has one bag of mulch left.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.337
He can't believe it.
This has never happened before.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.006
Well, the extra bag of mulch
drives him crazy.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.384
He's the guy who always gets
the right amount of mulch.

12:39.468 --> 12:43.138
He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"

12:43.221 --> 12:46.224
So, on the drive home,
he throws the bag of mulch

12:46.308 --> 12:48.852
out the window
over the side of the 101.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.563
-And?
-Well, that's it.

12:51.689 --> 12:54.149
-He throws it out the window.
-That's the punch line?

12:54.232 --> 12:55.567
-It's kind of a thinker.
-I'll say.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.486
Makes me think you forgot
the rest of the joke.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.070
No, no, oh, just picture it.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.865
He's on the 101,
and he throws the bag of mulch

13:01.948 --> 13:03.659
out over the side of the freeway.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.161
I got the narrative.
That wasn't the source of my confusion.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.497
The confusion was
about the joke not being funny.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.332
Why does everything have to be funny?

13:10.415 --> 13:12.917
Everything doesn't always have
to be funny. Just jokes.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.837
Well, everyone at the network loves it.
Ha, ha.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.840
Sorry, I just thought about it again.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.842
-Ha! Mulch.
-Listen, Wanda.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.095
I think maybe there's some things
we kind of glossed over

13:24.179 --> 13:25.930
as we rushed into this relationship.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.807
We don't know each other at all.

13:27.891 --> 13:31.269
-Maybe we should take a step back and--
-BoJack, watch out!

13:31.353 --> 13:33.605
-[both] Aah!
-Oh, no!

13:34.481 --> 13:37.693
-What was that?
-A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?

13:37.776 --> 13:39.861
I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."

13:39.944 --> 13:43.073
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makes
when you hit it with your car.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.991
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.869
Hey, what are you doing here in
the middle of the road? Are you crazy?

13:47.952 --> 13:49.204
[groaning and grunting]

13:52.916 --> 13:56.044
BoJack, we just hit a deer.
We have to get him to a hospital.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.837
He's fine. He's in the woods.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.716
You know, you hit a deer
and they limp off to the woods to...

14:00.799 --> 14:03.468
continue living their lives.
What are you doing?

14:03.552 --> 14:06.054
I'm going to find him
and I'm going to help him.

14:06.137 --> 14:09.015
If you wanna go for a walk
in the woods at night, go crazy,

14:09.099 --> 14:10.975
but I'm not going anywhere.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.061
Okay, knock yourself out.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.355
I'll wait here, just me and my tunes.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.733
[man on radio]
It's A Prairie Home Companion...

14:17.816 --> 14:19.443
-Oh, no.
-...marathon...

14:19.526 --> 14:21.903
-for the next 72 hours...
-Oh, God.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.155
-...commercial-free...
-No, thank you.

14:24.239 --> 14:27.618
-...on every single channel--
-What?!

14:27.909 --> 14:29.494
[sighs]

14:29.578 --> 14:30.829
Damn it.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.791
[BoJack panting]

14:37.377 --> 14:39.254
BoJack to the rescue.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.715
We should go back.
Nothing more we can do here.

14:41.799 --> 14:44.509
If you don't wanna do this with me,
wait in the car.

14:44.593 --> 14:47.011
-What is your plan here exactly?
-Oh.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.431
-What? What is it?
-Footprints, 400 yards ahead.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.392
-How can you see that far in the dark?
-I'm an owl.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.269
Oh, right.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.689
Okay, now you're just showing off.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.276
Are you okay? Ow.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.028
Stay back! There's more pinecones
where that came from.

15:04.112 --> 15:08.032
-Let us take you to the hospital.
-I can't go back to no hospital.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.285
This is the fourth time
I've been hit this year.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.412
Maybe you shouldn't
wear camouflage track suits.

15:12.496 --> 15:16.875
I don't have health care.
I didn't pay my bills, so I'm in arrears.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.544
A deer in arrears. Ha, ha.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.880
[in English accent]
What's that? She can't hear you.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.048
She's got a deer in her ears.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.803
Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just--
Just let us get you to a damn hospital.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.221
-I don't know.
-[in normal voice] I know you've been hurt

15:30.305 --> 15:33.350
and I know you're afraid.
We're all afraid.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.145
But you have to trust us.
It's gonna be okay.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.858
Not standing in the middle of the road
will also help, in the future.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.902
-You're not gonna hurt me again?
-I am not going to hurt you.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.153
Okay.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.655
[shouting]

15:46.905 --> 15:49.616
Starting now.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.590
-They said he's gonna be okay.
-Oh, great. Great.

16:05.674 --> 16:09.135
-Wanna hear another joke?
-Well, is it a joke or is it a story?

16:09.219 --> 16:12.138
I'll listen to another story,
if you stop calling them jokes.

16:12.556 --> 16:16.518
So, there's this couple who just started
dating and things are going really well.

16:16.601 --> 16:20.564
One day, the girl finds a box of old love
letters from her high school boyfriend.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.107
She reads them and, like,
loves how silly they are.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.736
You know,
the drama of young romance.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.488
So, on a whim, she sends the letters
to her ex-boyfriend

16:28.572 --> 16:30.532
thinking he might find them funny too.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.702
Well, okay, that night,
she tells her current boyfriend about it

16:33.785 --> 16:35.203
and he loses his shit.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.288
They get in a huge fight about it.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.709
He's all, "Why would you send
your ex the old love letters?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.961
He'll think
you're still in love with him!"

16:43.044 --> 16:45.756
And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"

16:45.839 --> 16:48.884
-Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?
-Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.261
I forgot to mention that.
It doesn't matter.

16:51.344 --> 16:55.014
So, anyway, now the night is ruined
because Brandon is obsessed.

16:55.098 --> 16:58.101
He's like, "That ex-boyfriend's
going to come back for you.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.644
He knows where you live!"

16:59.728 --> 17:01.688
So, after dinner, he drives her home.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.566
She lives in one of those big buildings
by the freeway.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.192
And he walks her to her door,

17:06.276 --> 17:10.821
but he forgets to lock the car
and leaves the windows down.

17:10.906 --> 17:14.032
He kisses her good night,
but things are kind of weird, you know?

17:14.117 --> 17:17.078
Then he gets back in his car
and starts to drive away,

17:17.161 --> 17:19.705
but when he glances
in his rear-view mirror,

17:19.790 --> 17:22.208
his blood turns cold.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.335
Guess what's in the back seat.

17:24.419 --> 17:28.006
-The ex-boyfriend?
-No. The bag of mulch!

17:28.089 --> 17:30.425
What? Oh.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.928
Wow, that is actually
a really good joke.

17:33.011 --> 17:36.180
I told you. Some things take time.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.019
[Carolyn] I'll take you home.

17:41.102 --> 17:44.397
-Oh, come on, stick around a little.
-Nope. I gotta take Todd home.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.608
Had a wonderful time.
Really. It just flew by.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.819
-Come on, Todd, get in the car.
-[Todd] Okay.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.070
[mumbling]

17:53.239 --> 17:55.993
Um, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

17:56.075 --> 17:59.078
What happened? No, I don't wanna talk
about what happened,

17:59.162 --> 18:01.539
-I just wanna clean up.
-Okay.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.208
-Why? What do you think happened?
-I just--

18:04.292 --> 18:07.378
Because what I think happened
is that BoJack's girlfriend asked

18:07.462 --> 18:10.674
what Tony Curtis was up to
and I said, "Tony Curtis died."

18:10.757 --> 18:12.550
-And you said, "Did he?"
-Right, but---

18:12.634 --> 18:15.219
And I said, "Yes, he did."
And you said, "Really?

18:15.303 --> 18:16.847
-I'm not sure about that."
-Yeah--

18:16.930 --> 18:20.141
And I said, "Well, I am."
And you said, "I'm not so sure."

18:20.224 --> 18:22.560
And I said, "I'm telling you,
Tony Curtis is dead."

18:22.644 --> 18:24.354
And you said,
"Let's check the Internet."

18:24.437 --> 18:27.440
And I said, "We don't need to check
the Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."

18:27.524 --> 18:30.401
And you said, "Let's just check though."

18:30.485 --> 18:32.988
Is that what you think happened?

18:33.071 --> 18:34.614
So, do you wanna talk about it?

18:34.698 --> 18:36.950
It kind of feels
like you wanna talk about it.

18:37.034 --> 18:40.453
I don't understand why you couldn't
just believe that I know something.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.246
I believe you know lots of things.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.332
I just thought,
what's the harm in checking?

18:44.415 --> 18:47.085
Especially since we have
these amazing little boxes now

18:47.168 --> 18:50.964
with 24-hour access to the world's
largest source of information.

18:51.048 --> 18:54.551
You shouldn't have to check if your wife
knows what she's talking about.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.887
You humiliated me
in front of all my friends.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.680
You can give it a rest. Show's over.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.224
Okay, but don't I get
a little bit of credit

19:01.307 --> 19:05.353
for inviting all of your friends
to an awesome surprise party?

19:05.436 --> 19:09.357
No, because why did you think I would
want an awesome surprise party?

19:09.440 --> 19:12.193
Is it the awesome part
you object to or...?

19:12.276 --> 19:15.196
You always just assume
that everyone wants whatever you want.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.281
Well, you know
what they say about assuming.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.951
Makes an ass out of you and "ming."

19:20.035 --> 19:21.202
Who's Ming?

19:21.452 --> 19:22.787
[groans]

19:23.830 --> 19:27.291
I'm sorry, Diane. Okay?
I'm sorry I threw you a party.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.086
What a monster.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.922
Throwing you a party
like some sort of terrorist.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.549
It's a well-known fact
that if you really hate someone,

19:34.632 --> 19:37.301
really wanna hit them where it hurts,
throw them a party.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.513
That's why when we go to war,
we don't drop bombs on the enemy.

19:40.597 --> 19:46.477
We drop parties! So, I'm so sorry
I threw you an amazing party.

19:46.561 --> 19:50.148
You didn't throw me an amazing party.
You threw you an amazing party.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.900
Everything today has been about you.

19:51.983 --> 19:55.528
Really? That picnic we had
in the tea garden was about me?

19:55.612 --> 19:58.322
That trip to the library was about me?

19:58.406 --> 20:01.701
"Women on the Wall: An Exploration
of Gender in Text and Media,

20:01.785 --> 20:05.288
Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer
in conversation with Helen Molesworth"

20:05.371 --> 20:06.706
was about me?!

20:06.790 --> 20:09.918
Oh, sure. Fine. Just walk away.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.294
[shouts]

20:12.129 --> 20:15.715
Oh. So now you're gonna play in the
ball pit without me? Real mature, Diane.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.885
Why does my birthday party
have a ball pit?

20:18.969 --> 20:22.180
-So I could get these T-shirts made.
-Ugh.

20:22.263 --> 20:25.183
Also, you once told me
that when you were a little girl,

20:25.266 --> 20:28.269
you dreamed of living in a house
that had a ballroom.

20:28.352 --> 20:32.315
-A ballroom is not a room full-- No!
-Heads up! Yes!

20:32.398 --> 20:36.653
Mr. Peanutbutter, some part of you must
have known I wouldn't like any of this.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.780
But I went balls-to-the-wall
for this party.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.407
Literally, there are balls
all the way to the wall.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.368
Right, but I've told you so many times,
I don't like parties.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.329
But it's the thought that counts, right?

20:46.412 --> 20:50.167
That's exactly-- The thought was... Ugh!

20:54.504 --> 20:57.924
-What did you do to the spare bedroom?
-Every room has a theme.

20:58.008 --> 21:00.510
And this room's theme is Starbucks.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.680
-Starbucks is not a theme.
-Can we not fight in the Starbucks?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.765
I don't wanna be a couple
who fights at Starbucks.

21:05.849 --> 21:09.186
Okay. Fine. You did go all out.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.022
I really thought you'd like this.
I know you love Starbucks.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.065
-I don't love--
-You don't love Starbucks,

21:14.149 --> 21:17.735
you love the independent coffee place,
Starbucks is more convenient.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.487
-Yeah.
-See?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.531
I do sometimes listen.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.575
-Can I get you a decaf Americano?
-Sure.

21:24.659 --> 21:28.913
I know you put a lot of thought into today
and I appreciate that, really--

21:28.997 --> 21:31.666
I have a decaf Americano
on the bar for Darren.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.459
Is there a Darren here?

21:33.543 --> 21:35.128
Says Darren on the cup.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.714
Thank you. This is very realistic.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.674
I know, right?

21:39.757 --> 21:43.302
You wanna go check out the pool?
I filled it up with Jell-O.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.849
[Diane] Ah.

21:48.516 --> 21:51.269
I still can't believe I'm 35.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.396
Would you believe I'm 35?

21:53.521 --> 21:54.731
[chuckles]

21:54.814 --> 21:56.983
-I'm still mad at you.
-I know.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.276
But I don't wanna be.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.486
Well, I don't want you
to be mad at me either.

22:00.570 --> 22:04.407
We only have so many days together.
I want every one to be a happy one.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.869
Oh, my God.
You don't want me to go to Cordovia.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.996
-What?!
-You don't think I know what it means

22:10.080 --> 22:11.831
when you say shit like...

22:11.915 --> 22:14.959
"We only have so many days together"?

22:15.043 --> 22:19.714
-Uh, what?
-"Diane, I love waking up next to you."

22:19.797 --> 22:23.801
"Diane, I wish
every day could be like this."

22:23.885 --> 22:26.221
-Yeah, but--
-"Just the two of us, together."

22:26.304 --> 22:29.849
Do you have any idea how that feels
when I'm trying to plan my trip?

22:29.933 --> 22:31.184
Okay. You got me!

22:31.268 --> 22:33.519
Maybe I don't want my wife,

22:33.603 --> 22:37.232
whom I love, to go off
on a terrifying six-month tour

22:37.315 --> 22:40.777
of the most war-torn,
disease-splattered corners of the planet

22:40.860 --> 22:43.571
with a charming, handsome,
billionaire bachelor.

22:43.654 --> 22:46.407
What could I be thinking?
I'm such a terrible husband.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.160
I'm not happy.

22:49.244 --> 22:52.038
-With me?
-I don't know.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.748
With everything.

22:53.831 --> 22:57.043
I wake up in the morning
and I feel like I have no purpose.

22:57.127 --> 23:00.880
And I'm 35. And if I don't make
some change in my life,

23:00.964 --> 23:03.507
then this is how
I'm gonna feel forever.

23:03.591 --> 23:04.926
-Honey--
-But then I think

23:05.009 --> 23:08.054
about Sebastian St. Clair
and going to work with him,

23:08.138 --> 23:10.807
helping people and making a difference.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.269
And I feel like I have a reason
to get out of bed.

23:14.352 --> 23:16.104
I didn't know you felt that way.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.397
If you told me that,
I would have heard it.

23:18.481 --> 23:21.692
Mr. Peanutbutter, you know I love you
and think you're a good dog.

23:21.776 --> 23:25.196
Yes, you are. Yes, you are,
and I love your cute, funny face,

23:25.280 --> 23:27.324
but I don't wanna be one
of those couples

23:27.406 --> 23:30.576
that settles into a routine
and never changes.

23:30.660 --> 23:33.788
Well, I don't know what to say
because I'm an old dog

23:33.871 --> 23:35.581
and I'm not gonna change.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.417
Do you know what I do
while you're at work all day?

23:39.794 --> 23:41.587
I mostly just sit right there.

23:41.671 --> 23:44.924
Sometimes I pretend to dig a little hole
and then I take a nap.

23:45.008 --> 23:49.971
And when I hear your car in the driveway,
it is the best part of my day.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.140
I mean, I go insane.

23:52.223 --> 23:55.352
I know, and I love you so much,

23:55.434 --> 23:58.479
but you're never going
to be my only priority like that.

23:58.562 --> 24:01.274
That's just not how I'm wired.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.734
I need to also live my life.

24:03.818 --> 24:07.155
Well... okay.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.656
Is it okay?

24:08.739 --> 24:14.204
If I change and try new things
and you still love me?

24:14.287 --> 24:17.707
And you just stay the same person
you've always been and I still love you?

24:17.790 --> 24:22.253
Uh, yeah, that sounds good to me.
Does that work for you?

24:22.337 --> 24:25.089
Yeah, I think that works.

24:25.173 --> 24:28.592
Just don't throw me
any more surprise parties, okay?

24:28.843 --> 24:31.262
Uh, yeah, noted.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.181
I can't believe you got me a ball pit.

24:33.264 --> 24:37.852
And you're saying no part of you wants
to go jump in that ball pit right now?

24:37.935 --> 24:39.354
[Diane] Well, maybe a little.

24:39.437 --> 24:42.606
-Does that make me a hypocrite?
-No, it just means you changed.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.651
It's one of the things I love about you.

24:49.447 --> 24:52.283
Surprise!

24:52.367 --> 24:54.577
Hello? Anybody?

24:54.660 --> 24:57.080
This is Paul McCartney.

24:57.163 --> 25:01.000
I came all this way to jump out of a cake?
Honest.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.461
