WEBVTT

00:00.635 --> 00:02.981
Jeez, LaRue,
can you believe this?

00:02.994 --> 00:05.505
A mandatory meeting
at 7:00 A.M.?

00:05.939 --> 00:07.823
Wonder what crawled up her butt.

00:07.908 --> 00:10.576
Ugh, there's no telling.
Our bodies are aswarm

00:10.644 --> 00:12.578
with microscopic organisms, Pam.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.446
Literally aswarm.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.981
Wait. What?
What have you heard?

00:16.050 --> 00:18.884
About the staff meeting?
Oh, right. Yes. Never mind.

00:18.953 --> 00:20.752
Then may I suggest
we get up there,

00:20.821 --> 00:23.856
so we don't have to find out
what "grave consequences" means.

00:23.924 --> 00:27.626
[Scoffs] It means--
In the context of her memo.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.695
Jesus, what's up his butt?

00:29.763 --> 00:31.530
I think the important thing now

00:31.599 --> 00:33.523
is that we don't start
any sort of panic.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.502
Hurry up, ya ding-dongs!

00:36.570 --> 00:38.570
Wait, wait, wait! I'm coming!
Hurry up.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.149
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, keep your panties on.

00:41.269 --> 00:44.268
One step ahead of you.
Or am I?

00:45.278 --> 00:47.318
Wait. Is Archer
blowing this off?

00:47.438 --> 00:49.481
No. Hold the door. Hold the door!
[Bell dings]

00:49.550 --> 00:50.883
I am.
It's not doing anything.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.818
Damn it, Ray,
hold the frickin' door!

00:52.887 --> 00:55.454
Oh, no!
It's <i> maximum overdrive</i> all over--

00:55.523 --> 00:57.523

00:59.793 --> 01:01.727
[Breathing heavily]
Oh, good. You made it.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.829
Look, Ray,
one is red and one is green.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.597
What are you, color blind?

01:05.666 --> 01:08.767
I am, actually.
<i>♪♪ [Easy listening]</i>

01:08.836 --> 01:11.570
Typical.
Of what?

01:11.639 --> 01:14.840
So, does anybody have any idea
what this meeting is about?

01:14.909 --> 01:17.409
Well, if I know Ms. Archer, it's--
Butt bugs.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.677
[Laughing] What?
Not what I was--

01:18.746 --> 01:20.746
Ugh! That was
a figure of speech.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.482
They all are!
Hey, will you quit yelling?

01:23.551 --> 01:24.683
Will you?
Yes!

01:24.752 --> 01:27.108
Hey!
Remain calm. Do not panic.

01:27.228 --> 01:28.720
No one's panicking, Krieger.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.589
Only because they
haven't hatched yet.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.691
Who?
What hasn't hatched?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.526
What?
Quit yelling!

01:34.595 --> 01:36.595
Krieger, what hasn't hatched?
I've said too much.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.497
Krieger, I swear to--
[Thudding]

01:39.667 --> 01:42.568
[All gasp, mutter]
[Creaking]

01:42.636 --> 01:43.702
[All gasp]
Oh, my God.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.871
Remain calm.
Do not panic.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.739
Krieger, shut up.
See? It's broken.

01:47.808 --> 01:48.874
Ray?
Archer?

01:48.943 --> 01:50.013
Hang on.

01:50.133 --> 01:51.677
Ray, Cyril, give me a hand here.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.089
[All straining]

01:54.209 --> 01:55.714
Lana...
What?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.749
You--
Should be doing this.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.452
You know...
[All grunting]

02:02.134 --> 02:04.489
[Gasping] Oh, my God!
We work in a coal mine?

02:04.558 --> 02:05.791
Carol, shut up.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.793
You're not
my coal mine supervisor!

02:07.861 --> 02:10.729
Yeah. Hey, guys?

02:10.798 --> 02:13.298
[Men grunting, straining]

02:14.635 --> 02:16.535
Oh, damn it.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.944
What?
What is it?

02:18.064 --> 02:20.227
Well, thanks to Ray,
who let's just all assume

02:20.347 --> 02:23.375
broke the elevator somehow,
we're stuck at the top.

Hello!
Hello!

03:12.495 --> 03:14.629
Stop it.
No one else can hear you,

03:14.698 --> 03:16.531
because no one else is here yet.

03:16.599 --> 03:19.367
[Beeping]
Not that other people actually work here.

03:19.436 --> 03:20.568
What do you mean?
Where'd they go?

03:20.637 --> 03:22.370
Remember when
the office shut down,

03:22.439 --> 03:24.539
and we spent an entire year
as coke dealers?

03:24.607 --> 03:27.342
What, so people just quit?
And on the subject of things

03:27.410 --> 03:28.855
that don't work here anymore,

03:28.975 --> 03:30.912
my phone.
Uh, got nothing.

03:30.981 --> 03:34.816
I am sans bars.
Yeah, you're not gonna get a signal.

03:34.884 --> 03:36.784
I installed an R.F. jammer
on the roof.

03:36.853 --> 03:39.721
Of the building?
No, of the elevator.

03:39.789 --> 03:41.389
Why?
You did what?

03:41.458 --> 03:42.390
[Clears throat]

03:42.459 --> 03:45.493
And for what possible reason?

03:45.562 --> 03:48.629
So people would quit staring at their
phones and talk to each other.

03:48.698 --> 03:50.732
Okay, well,
then let's open the--

03:50.800 --> 03:52.633
One, two, three, go!
Trap door!

03:52.702 --> 03:54.469
Ray, open the trap door.

03:54.537 --> 03:55.703
He can't.
Wha--

03:55.772 --> 03:57.405
Oh, my God!
Cyril, please.

03:57.474 --> 03:59.741
I am way stronger than you.

03:59.809 --> 04:02.510
[Straining]
That being said, this thing's stuck.

04:02.579 --> 04:05.346
It's not stuck,
it's locked from the outside.

04:05.415 --> 04:08.516
Wait. What?
It's not for stranded passengers to get out,

04:08.585 --> 04:10.418
it's for rescue crews to get in.

04:10.487 --> 04:12.553
The last thing they want
is people crawling around

04:12.622 --> 04:14.689
on top of a malfunctioning
elevator car.

04:14.758 --> 04:17.524
Who is "they"?
Big elevator.

04:17.594 --> 04:18.793
Not a thing.

04:18.862 --> 04:20.762
And why do you know
so much about elevators?

04:20.829 --> 04:22.663
I don't know.
It's a hobby.

04:22.732 --> 04:25.556
I guess I've just always
been fascinated by them.

04:25.930 --> 04:28.536
I honestly have
no response to that.

04:28.605 --> 04:30.371
Anyway, I bet the top
of the car smashed

04:30.440 --> 04:31.672
right into the motor, so--

04:31.741 --> 04:34.509
Yeesh. Hope
the radio jammer's okay.

04:34.577 --> 04:36.511
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow! Ow!

04:36.579 --> 04:39.514
Thanks, Krieger.
I think we all needed that.

04:39.582 --> 04:42.617
And besides, we don't need cell phones.
We have a--

04:42.685 --> 04:44.552
Elevator phone!
Cyril, try that.

04:44.621 --> 04:46.687
I am, if you'd shut up.

04:46.756 --> 04:49.323
Oh, gross!
This phone is all sticky.

04:49.392 --> 04:51.459
Yeah, mine at home
gets bad sticky.

04:51.528 --> 04:52.727
Ew.
Of course it does.

04:52.796 --> 04:55.596
And since when are you elevator boss?
Birth?

04:55.665 --> 04:57.331
And...

04:57.400 --> 04:59.467
It's dead.
Typical.

04:59.536 --> 05:02.470
Okay, Ray. Interface.

05:02.539 --> 05:04.505
I'm sorry?
With the controls.

05:04.574 --> 05:06.674
Beep, boop, boop, boop!
Come on, cyborg.

05:06.743 --> 05:09.510
R2-D2 it.
"R2-D2 it."

05:09.579 --> 05:11.646
Yeah, probe around
in there and whatever.

05:11.714 --> 05:13.448
Shut down the tractor beam.

05:13.516 --> 05:15.316
With what, my dick?

05:15.385 --> 05:17.485
I-- however you
normally do it.

05:17.554 --> 05:19.253
I don't normally do it!

05:19.322 --> 05:20.621
I know, but this
is an emergency.

05:20.690 --> 05:22.490
Hey! Hey!

05:22.559 --> 05:23.691
Damn it, Carol.
There's nobody--

05:23.760 --> 05:25.626
Shut up, stupid.
It's Milton!

Go get help, boy.

05:29.499 --> 05:32.567

There's no time! Go get help!

05:32.635 --> 05:34.185
[Beeps]

05:36.506 --> 05:38.639
Get help how?
It's a toaster.

05:38.708 --> 05:42.443
Well! Well, at the very least,
maybe he'll bring back toast.

05:42.512 --> 05:44.512
And speaking of toast,
I don't know about you guys,

05:44.514 --> 05:47.248
but I didn't eat any...
[Chomping loudly]

05:47.317 --> 05:49.283
Breakfast.
Hey, hey, wait a second.

05:49.352 --> 05:51.285
Get your own goddamn bear claw!

05:51.354 --> 05:53.287
Cyril, what is that?
Is that a bagel?

05:53.356 --> 05:55.356
No. Get off.
Jeez, it's just napkins.

05:55.425 --> 05:57.458
Guys, get the napkins!
Okay, let's just take it down a n--

05:57.527 --> 05:59.327
Shut up!
We're all gonna starve!

05:59.395 --> 06:00.661
Give me...
Get away!

06:00.730 --> 06:03.397
Guys, come on.
Knock it off, please.

06:03.466 --> 06:05.500
Easy! Hey! Hey!
Pam, stop that.

06:05.568 --> 06:07.201

06:15.411 --> 06:17.678
Asshole!
What the hell?

06:17.747 --> 06:20.314
I'm sorry.
Seriously, I'm sorry.

06:20.383 --> 06:22.583
I sincerely apologize
for doing that.

06:22.652 --> 06:24.285
Archer,
if you do that again--

06:24.354 --> 06:26.287
I swear to God
I won't do it again.

06:26.356 --> 06:27.555
Please don't.
You're listening for once.

06:27.624 --> 06:29.524
That being said,

06:29.592 --> 06:32.193
I swear to God
I will do it again.

06:32.825 --> 06:33.736
Asshole.

06:33.856 --> 06:34.821
Ray, shut up!

06:35.061 --> 06:37.061
Cyril, let's get that
sweater vest off, buddy.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.131
I'm sorry?
I know, but nobody makes you wear them.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.066
I-- why do you want it?

06:42.135 --> 06:44.034
As, like, a tablecloth
or whatever.

06:44.103 --> 06:46.036
We're all gonna put our food
and drink in the middle,

06:46.105 --> 06:48.105
and then I'll be in charge
of rationing it out.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.107
No.
Why do you think you would be in charge?

06:50.176 --> 06:52.009
Because I've been lost at sea.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.630
[Laughs]
What?

06:53.750 --> 06:57.223
I was lost at sea, Lana, and we
had to ration the food and water.

06:57.522 --> 06:59.884
Well, we should have.
I actually ate it all

06:59.952 --> 07:01.685
while the other guy was asleep.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.034
Why would you tell us
that story?

07:03.055 --> 07:04.822
If anything,
that proves my point.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.824
People like me are exactly why

07:06.893 --> 07:08.792
we have to ration
our food and water.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.094
People like you, who?

07:10.163 --> 07:12.997
The strong,
like me and you and Pam,

07:13.065 --> 07:15.699
who will naturally
prey on the weak,

07:15.768 --> 07:17.101
like the rest of them.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.104
[Sighs]
Maybe we should pool it together.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.039
We don't know how long
we're gonna be in here.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.807
Yeah, give it up, weakie.

07:23.876 --> 07:25.109
Pam, shut up.
I'll start.

07:25.178 --> 07:28.045
Here's...maybe
six ounces of Bourbon.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.714
[Grunting]
If Cyril would hurry it up already!

07:30.783 --> 07:32.049
For the love of God,
will you just--

07:32.118 --> 07:33.193
Okay. Wait a minute.

07:33.313 --> 07:35.188
How exactly is this
supposed to work?

07:35.308 --> 07:37.054
It puts the vest on the floor!

07:37.123 --> 07:38.956
We put food and drink
on the vest!

07:39.025 --> 07:40.352
Yeah, but where on the floor?

07:40.472 --> 07:42.760
There's no room.
It'll get kicked over.

07:42.828 --> 07:45.629
Okay, so we tie the vest into,
like, a pouch, and--

07:45.698 --> 07:47.665
For God's sake, man,
it has no sleeves.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.633
Plus the food'll just
fall out the neckhole.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.001
[Sighs]
Well, then it's official.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.438
The sweater vest
is literally good for nothing.

07:53.558 --> 07:56.470
Hey, you know what?
Besides how to dress like an adult?

07:56.590 --> 07:59.710
Well, that's the only thing
you do like an adult.

07:59.779 --> 08:00.811
[Snaps fingers]
Burn!

08:00.880 --> 08:02.470
Yeah. Total burn.

08:02.590 --> 08:04.191
I hope I don't
start crying later

08:04.311 --> 08:07.718
when I'm driving an automobile
to or from a bar!

08:07.787 --> 08:09.702
After having sex
with a prostitute.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.382
Which is the most adult thing
a person could possibly do!

08:14.223 --> 08:16.108
I like him in vests.
Me too.

08:16.228 --> 08:17.318
Yeah. It works for him.

08:17.438 --> 08:19.160
Well, thanks, ladies.

08:19.228 --> 08:21.228
That's--
No. No. Shut up.

08:21.297 --> 08:23.230
I need to think.
About what?

08:23.299 --> 08:24.565
Look, this isn't
that hard, people.

08:24.634 --> 08:27.301
We've got a bagel, four
coffees, a quart of beer--

08:27.370 --> 08:28.502
[chuckling]
A quart?

08:28.571 --> 08:31.040
This a fawty, shawty!
Thanks, Omar.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.174
And on top of that, we've got, I'm
guessing, two flasks of bourbon.

08:34.243 --> 08:36.277
I didn't know if I'd
have time for lunch.

08:36.345 --> 08:38.212
And, Krieger? Coffee?

08:38.280 --> 08:39.613
Uh, no.

08:39.682 --> 08:41.448
Tea?
No.

08:41.517 --> 08:43.650
What is it, soup?

08:44.090 --> 08:45.600
Define "soup."

08:45.720 --> 08:47.221
[Scoffs]
Oh, good lord!

08:47.290 --> 08:48.651
Would it be safe
to say nobody here

08:48.691 --> 08:50.357
wants to eat
what's in your thermos?

08:50.426 --> 08:53.396
[Gasps] Sweet Jesus
God, I would hope so!

08:53.516 --> 08:56.203
Okay, so how about
we all agree to hold on

08:56.323 --> 08:58.265
to our food and drinks for now,
if for no other reason than--

08:58.334 --> 08:59.400
[gulping]

08:59.468 --> 09:00.401
Pam!
Pam!

09:00.469 --> 09:03.404
Come on!
Pam, stop it!

09:03.472 --> 09:05.105
[Belches]

09:05.174 --> 09:07.374
Oh, God!
That wasn't just bear claw.

09:07.443 --> 09:08.542
What did you eat for breakfast?

09:08.611 --> 09:10.110
[Belches]

09:10.179 --> 09:11.412
Linguine and clam sauce.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.082
Oh, God!
What, did you wake up on the docks?

09:15.151 --> 09:18.152
[Belches] But I don't know
about those clams, though.

09:18.221 --> 09:20.421
As I was saying,
before you, Pam,

09:20.489 --> 09:23.190
drank a third of a gallon
of malt liquor,

09:23.259 --> 09:26.327
maybe we shouldn't eat
or drink too much, because--

09:26.395 --> 09:28.229
Yes, Pam?
I have to pee.

09:28.297 --> 09:30.431
Come on!
Of course you do. You just drank a 40!

09:30.499 --> 09:32.099
That's what I was trying to say.

09:32.168 --> 09:33.408
I'm not a frickin' mind reader.

09:33.469 --> 09:35.135
Yeah. In her defense,
you didn't finish.

09:35.204 --> 09:36.536
Yeah.
Pam, shut up.

09:36.656 --> 09:38.172
[Gasps]
I have an idea!

09:38.241 --> 09:40.374
Okay. Wait.
Does it have anything to do

09:40.443 --> 09:42.509
with our current situation?

09:42.578 --> 09:43.693
Yes.

09:43.813 --> 09:45.346
Okay, what is it?

09:45.414 --> 09:47.281
We are stuck in an elevator.

09:47.350 --> 09:50.251
The idea,
not our current situation.

09:50.319 --> 09:52.253
Well, I'm not
a frickin' mind reader!

09:52.321 --> 09:54.421
[Gasps]
Oh, my God, what if I am?

09:54.490 --> 09:58.225
Then I guess you'd know what we're
all thinking right this very minute.

09:58.294 --> 10:01.528
Okay. You want a drink,
you want to lecture us,

10:01.597 --> 10:04.498
you want more bear claws, you want
to smoke, you want to masturbate,

10:04.567 --> 10:07.567
and you're scared that we'll figure out
you're actually just a Krieger clone.

10:07.603 --> 10:11.205
What? That's--
That's all just common sense.

10:11.274 --> 10:13.374
How is it common sense that she
thinks I want to masturbate?

10:13.442 --> 10:15.376
Come on, Cyril.
For most of us,

10:15.444 --> 10:17.444
she just rattled off
our obvious addictions.

10:17.513 --> 10:20.034
I'm not addicted
to lecturing people.

10:20.154 --> 10:22.116
[Laughter]

10:24.220 --> 10:26.553
Oh, come on.
That's... All right.

10:26.622 --> 10:28.933
And what are you
laughing at, stroker ace?

10:29.053 --> 10:30.986
I'm not addicted
to masturbating!

10:31.055 --> 10:33.656
Cyril, come on.
Hand on the Bible,

10:33.725 --> 10:35.524
lie detector, gun to your head,

10:35.593 --> 10:37.827
you don't want
to masturbate right now?

10:37.895 --> 10:40.796
Well, not in this elevator.

10:40.865 --> 10:42.665
Well, I want to drink, so...

10:42.734 --> 10:44.667
And I want to smoke, so...

10:44.736 --> 10:46.176
So Cyril ought
to be able to jack it.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.798
Pam, shut up.
Well, we tried.

10:47.918 --> 10:50.906
And just where, exactly, were you
hoping to smoke that cigarette?

10:50.975 --> 10:52.369
Magnum P.I.'s house.

10:52.489 --> 10:54.744
But since I'm stuck in here
with you people...

10:54.812 --> 10:57.680
Hey! What the shit, woman?

10:57.749 --> 10:59.149
The shit is that
I am breastfeeding,

10:59.234 --> 11:01.422
so you will not smoke
in this elevator!

11:01.542 --> 11:03.552
You want to bet?
Do you?

11:03.621 --> 11:05.621
[Grunting]
They're both addicted to gambling.

11:05.690 --> 11:07.857
And you're just a regular Sylvia Browne.
[Thudding]

11:07.925 --> 11:09.925
I also have
extreme claustrophobia.

11:09.994 --> 11:12.628
Psst, Cyril.
Try to rub one out.

11:12.697 --> 11:14.964
I do not want to masturbate!

11:15.032 --> 11:17.800
Oh, for--
Not even watching that?

11:17.869 --> 11:20.870
[Archer] Hey! Guys, come on! Hey!
Get your hands o--

11:20.938 --> 11:23.232
[clicks]
Aah.

11:23.352 --> 11:25.875
I'm serious.
I cannot stress this enough.

11:25.943 --> 11:28.041
You do not want tinnitus.

11:28.161 --> 11:29.678
How about cirrhosis?

11:29.747 --> 11:31.995
Probably not that either.

11:32.357 --> 11:34.550
Now, then.
Carol, you had an idea?

11:34.619 --> 11:36.525
[Gasps]
Are you a mind reader, too?

11:36.645 --> 11:38.954
No. You told us
that you had one.

11:39.023 --> 11:41.076
What? Oh, right. Yes.

11:41.196 --> 11:43.592
We all jump up and down
at the same time

11:43.661 --> 11:45.188
to unjam this stupid thing,

11:45.308 --> 11:47.072
and then it plummets
down into the basement,

11:47.192 --> 11:49.732
and we boing into
that giant spring

11:49.801 --> 11:51.567
at the bottom of
the elevator shaft,

11:51.636 --> 11:54.054
and then are safe.

11:55.873 --> 11:58.741
So, suicide pact.
An oldie but a goodie.

11:58.810 --> 12:00.576
Should we vote?
Who's in?

12:00.645 --> 12:01.877
Uh-uh. No.
No. Not doing that.

12:01.946 --> 12:04.647
No. That works.
I've heard about people doing that.

12:04.715 --> 12:06.749
You just want an excuse
to wet your pants.

12:06.818 --> 12:08.651
I don't need an excuse.

12:08.719 --> 12:10.586
Yeah, what is this,
Soviet Russia?

12:10.655 --> 12:12.922
It-- wait.
Are you seriously asking?

12:12.990 --> 12:14.857
[Scoffs]
I mean...

12:14.926 --> 12:16.892
Krieger, what's the deal?
Would that really work?

12:16.961 --> 12:20.596
Wha-- you're asking the guy with a
thermos full of human being soup?

12:20.665 --> 12:22.698
It's--
that's not even-- if--

12:22.767 --> 12:24.533
What is this, Soviet Russia?

12:24.602 --> 12:25.701
Right?
Oh, my God.

12:25.770 --> 12:27.139
Cyril, shut up.
You shut up!

12:27.259 --> 12:28.873
Krieger, would that work?

12:28.993 --> 12:31.507
Huh. Maybe?

12:31.576 --> 12:33.642
Maybe?
What do you mean, maybe?

12:33.711 --> 12:35.845
Look, first of all, there's no
giant spring at the bottom.

12:35.913 --> 12:37.913
It's a hydraulic buffer, but you
don't want to be in the elevator

12:37.982 --> 12:39.715
when it slams into it.

12:39.784 --> 12:42.115
No, but at the last second,
you just jump up in the air.

12:42.235 --> 12:43.786
How would you know when to jump?

12:43.855 --> 12:45.554
Because you'd give me
a lecture on it.

12:45.623 --> 12:47.623
Burn!

12:47.692 --> 12:48.820
Ray!
She burned her.

12:48.940 --> 12:51.660
I know, but--
No. Shut up, because here's the thing--

12:51.729 --> 12:52.895
safety brakes.

12:52.964 --> 12:54.763
That's actually what
Elisha Otis invented.

12:54.832 --> 12:55.831
Not the elevator itself,

12:55.900 --> 12:57.800
but the safety brakes
to stop it.

12:57.869 --> 12:59.869
It was too bad
they couldn't stop diphtheria.

12:59.937 --> 13:01.604
So wait.
Would the brakes stop us?

13:01.672 --> 13:02.805
Maybe?

13:02.874 --> 13:05.374
Ugh!
Oh, my God! Come on!

13:05.443 --> 13:07.409
Look, I don't know if they
were damaged in the crash.

13:07.478 --> 13:08.940
Okay, but what's the worst case?

13:09.060 --> 13:12.120
Worst case is we die.
Impaled on your boner.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.550
I do not have an erection!

13:14.619 --> 13:16.619
Well, maybe not now,
but say you get

13:16.687 --> 13:18.049
a severe head injury on impact.

13:18.169 --> 13:19.788
Boom! Priapism!

13:19.857 --> 13:21.490
[Sighs]
Meanwhile, your bodies

13:21.559 --> 13:23.459
are smashing around in here
like crash dummies,

13:23.528 --> 13:26.875
until, one at a time, you are each
impaled on my priapic erection.

13:26.995 --> 13:30.566
Yeah.
Like meat at a Brazilian steakhouse!

13:30.635 --> 13:32.042
Ugh, please don't talk
about food.

13:32.162 --> 13:33.836
Yeah, I am
figuratively starving.

13:33.905 --> 13:36.849
For meat or Cyril's priapism?
Both.

13:36.969 --> 13:39.057
I can't take it! I am smoking!
Ray!

13:39.177 --> 13:41.161
Ow!
Get your foot off my lighter!

13:41.281 --> 13:43.381
Ray, I am serious.
God damn it!

13:43.450 --> 13:46.384
I'll put my mouth right up next
to the hole and blow into it.

13:46.453 --> 13:48.253
Err! Fine, but--

13:48.322 --> 13:50.155
Wait a minute.
Well, then I'm peeing.

13:50.224 --> 13:52.424
Where?
I think I can get it all back in here.

13:52.493 --> 13:55.805
No, you can't!
Wait a minute. Everybody stop now.

13:55.925 --> 13:57.526
What?
Two things.

13:57.646 --> 14:00.280
One, I really think we need
to have a serious talk

14:00.349 --> 14:01.648
about getting phrasing
back in the mix.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.550
[All talking at once] Let it go.

14:03.619 --> 14:06.386
Fine. Whatever.
No more phrasing.

14:06.455 --> 14:09.189
What was thing two?
Oh, nothing.

14:09.258 --> 14:11.491
[Sniffing]
I'm just having a stroke.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.328
[Gasps]
No, you're not. It's Milton! He came back!

14:15.397 --> 14:17.581
[Beeps]
[All cheering]

14:17.666 --> 14:20.383
Milton!
There you are!

14:20.469 --> 14:23.670
[Peeing into bottle] What the--
God damn it, Pam!

14:23.739 --> 14:25.572
Oh, no, no, no!
[Pee splashing on ground]

14:25.641 --> 14:27.607
For the love of God, woman!

14:27.676 --> 14:30.343
[Pam] I thought the hole was bigger.
[Bottle clatters]

14:31.580 --> 14:34.247
[Sighs]
I mean...

14:34.316 --> 14:36.407
[Milton beeping]

14:37.217 --> 14:39.762
Ugh, it's soaking wet down here...

14:40.481 --> 14:42.414
Get it, get it, get it
before it gets on me!

14:42.483 --> 14:44.550
With what? There's nothing
to wipe it up with.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.286
A-ha! Maybe it is good for something.
[Pee sloshes]

14:47.354 --> 14:49.521
Are you crazy?
That's cashmere!

14:49.590 --> 14:51.356
Wh-- oh, my God. Sorry.

14:51.425 --> 14:52.591
What, so it's non-absorbent?

14:52.660 --> 14:55.461
Lana, it's cashmere.
There are rules.

14:55.529 --> 14:57.496
I'm sorry, Cyril.
I didn't know.

14:57.565 --> 15:00.987
[Ray] Aw, son of a bitch!
What's wrong?

15:01.107 --> 15:03.402
Guess we can go ahead
and use my suit pants.

15:03.471 --> 15:05.437
You can just say "pants."
[Laughing]

15:05.506 --> 15:07.061
Pam wet your pants.

15:07.191 --> 15:08.891
It's still basically everywhere!

15:08.959 --> 15:10.092
And if it gets
on my suede boots--

15:10.161 --> 15:12.928
Okay! Jeez!

15:12.997 --> 15:14.196
[All groan]

15:14.265 --> 15:16.298
Why aren't you
wearing underwear?

15:16.367 --> 15:18.033
What? Serious shit,

15:18.102 --> 15:20.035
did red dawn happen
and nobody told me about it?

15:20.104 --> 15:21.236
<i>Ne tak li?</i>

15:21.305 --> 15:24.273
[Pee sloshing]

15:24.341 --> 15:25.874
There! Happy?

15:25.943 --> 15:26.875
No.
No.

15:26.944 --> 15:27.910
Yes.

15:27.978 --> 15:29.144
Yeah. Hey,
and over here, too,

15:29.213 --> 15:30.312
because if it gets
on these boots,

15:30.381 --> 15:32.281
I will not be responsible
for my actions.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.883
Right? Isn't it
just so liberating?

15:34.952 --> 15:36.251
Hey, what's Milton doing?
What do you--

15:36.320 --> 15:39.054
He's making toast!
I want to see!

15:39.123 --> 15:41.023
Well, too bad, I'm in the hole!

15:41.091 --> 15:43.325
Stop torturing me!
Stop torturing <i> me!</i>

15:43.394 --> 15:45.160
Oh, for-- Ray,
take a picture of him!

15:45.229 --> 15:47.996
[Groans]
Where's my stupid phone?

15:48.065 --> 15:49.231
[Russian accent]
In Soviet Russia--

15:49.300 --> 15:50.232
Pam?

15:50.301 --> 15:52.167
--Toaster take picture of you.

15:52.236 --> 15:54.069
Doesn't even make sense.

15:54.138 --> 15:55.804
It makes perfect sense.
You don't make sense.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.172
It totally does.

15:57.241 --> 15:59.842
The K.G.B. bugs your apartment.
They put a camera in--

15:59.910 --> 16:01.076
All right! Jesus Christ!

16:01.145 --> 16:02.277
Holy shit!

16:02.346 --> 16:04.012
[All] What?
I've got a signal!

16:04.081 --> 16:06.215
[All celebrating]

16:06.283 --> 16:08.016
Yeah, I got, like, half a bar!

16:08.085 --> 16:09.218
Call 911! Call 911!

16:09.286 --> 16:10.953
[Russian accent]
In Soviet Russia--

16:11.021 --> 16:12.154
[Archer] Pam, stop it!

16:12.223 --> 16:14.223
<i>Ser'yezno.</i>
Yeah, seriously.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.859
<i>[Woman] 911 operator.</i>
<i>What is your emergency?</i>

16:16.927 --> 16:18.126
Hello! Can you hear me?

16:18.195 --> 16:20.195
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>I can barely hear you.</i>

16:20.264 --> 16:22.264
I'm trapped in an elevator!

16:22.333 --> 16:25.033
<i>I'm sorry?</i>
<i>You said you are trapped in an elevator?</i>

16:25.102 --> 16:26.034
Wh-- yes!

16:26.103 --> 16:27.970
<i>Ma'am, you have no call</i>

16:28.038 --> 16:29.037
<i>to get snippy with me!</i>

16:29.106 --> 16:30.939
[Chuckling]
"Ma'am."

16:31.008 --> 16:33.242
<i>And for the record,</i>
<i>being stuck in an elevator</i>

16:33.310 --> 16:35.077
<i>is not an emergency.</i>

16:35.145 --> 16:37.212
[All yelling angrily]

16:37.281 --> 16:39.882
<i>So I suggest</i>
<i>you call your super.</i>

16:39.950 --> 16:42.084
No, no, no, no!
<i>[Hangs up]</i>

16:43.988 --> 16:45.188
Oh, call her back and tell her

16:45.189 --> 16:47.122
Carol's got
crippling claustrophobia.

16:47.191 --> 16:49.224
Wait. What?
[Screams]

16:49.293 --> 16:51.193
[All groaning]
Oh, Jesus!

16:51.262 --> 16:53.435
