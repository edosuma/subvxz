00:34.940 --> 00:37.340
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>

00:37.340 --> 00:39.460
<i>my mother would remind me
each night before bed</i>

00:39.460 --> 00:44.060
<i>to open up my heart to God, 
for he was kind,merciful and just.</i>

00:44.940 --> 00:47.420
<i>Things changed when my
father left a few years later...</i>

00:47.420 --> 00:52.140
<i>leaving her to raise me and my brothers in a little place
on the edge of the Mojave Desert.</i>

00:52.220 --> 00:55.780
<i>She never talked of a
kind, merciful God again.</i>

00:56.540 --> 00:59.420
<i>Instead she spoke of a prophecy....</i>

00:59.420 --> 01:01.940
<i>Of a time when all the world
would be covered in darkness,</i>

01:01.940 --> 01:04.500
<i>and the fate of mankind
would be decided.</i>

01:04.700 --> 01:07.100
<i>One night I finally got up
the courage to ask my mother</i>

01:07.100 --> 01:11.500
<i>Why God had changed?
Why he was so mad at his children?</i>

01:12.800 --> 01:17.480
<i>"I don't know," she said,
tucking the covers around me.</i>

01:17.880 --> 01:21.400
<i>"I guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."</i>

04:22.480 --> 04:25.760
Goddamn animals.

04:25.760 --> 04:32.080
In nights like this I'd like to take a match to this city so 
I could watch all these motherfuckers burn.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.760
Just a good ol' boy barbecue, eh?

04:34.760 --> 04:39.360
A fresh start. 
That’s what this place needs.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.680
Stop! Drop the bags,
put your hands on your head!

05:12.760 --> 05:15.160
It’s starting.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.680
There isn’t much time.

05:18.680 --> 05:23.400
Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now!

05:24.840 --> 05:28.000
Hands on your head!
On your head!

05:29.440 --> 05:33.280
Turn around! 
Turn the fuck around!

05:42.200 --> 05:44.880
Let him go!

05:44.880 --> 05:46.800
Let him fuck...

05:55.520 --> 05:57.640
Burton!

06:00.120 --> 06:04.560
What are you doing, Michael?
These weren't your orders.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.840
What is he saying?

06:06.840 --> 06:09.320
No, I'm following my own orders now.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.320
Then you will die along with the child.

06:12.320 --> 06:16.040
Burton, you fucking know this guy?
What the hell is...

07:28.620 --> 07:30.540
You okay, Jeep?

07:32.060 --> 07:35.420
Sorry I woke you, Charlie.
-Yeah. 

07:36.220 --> 07:38.580
Wasn't you.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.580
He's been kicking up a storm all night.

07:41.580 --> 07:44.460
Must know something I don't.

07:54.820 --> 07:56.900
Another bad dream?

07:59.700 --> 08:02.860
It's just stress, Jeep, that's all.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.100
You do too much worrying.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.300
About this place,
about your dad.

08:10.820 --> 08:13.020
About me.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.660
You're the only thing I
like to worry about.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.900
See what I mean?

08:22.900 --> 08:26.220
You're worried about a girl that's eight months pregnant,
and it isn't your baby.

08:27.180 --> 08:29.860
It's enough to give
anybody nightmares.

08:29.860 --> 08:32.460
Go ahead and make fun of me.

08:32.460 --> 08:35.380
Everybody else does.
- Come on.

08:36.659 --> 08:40.700
You know how much I appreciate everything
that you and Bob are doing for me.

08:44.620 --> 08:48.420
By the month from now, 
this baby will have a new family.

08:49.460 --> 08:52.300
I need to start to think about what the hell
I'm gonna do with my life.

08:54.020 --> 08:56.140
You're still going through with it?

08:58.940 --> 09:01.420
I'm not ready to be a mama.

09:02.300 --> 09:05.620
Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.380
I can help you.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.580
We can do it together, you know.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.420
I want to.

09:24.460 --> 09:28.100
You got to stop carrying the weight of the world
on your shoulders, Jeep.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.420
<i>I don't know whether I like it very much being
seen around with an angel without any wings.</i>

10:00.420 --> 10:05.060
<i>I've got to earn them and
you'll help me, won't you so?</i>

10:16.220 --> 10:19.980
Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days that
thing's gonna hit you back.

10:19.980 --> 10:23.820
What are you talking about, Percy?
We got a special relationship here.

10:23.820 --> 10:27.340
Yeah, they got names for that kind of relationship.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.860
It's disgusting.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.160
You're right.
It is disgusting.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.880
Really. How can she go out
in public looking like that?

10:45.880 --> 10:49.480
I don't know.
Why don't we just ask her?

10:50.840 --> 10:53.640
Howard, don't.
You'll embarrass me.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.760
Audrey, honey?

10:55.760 --> 10:57.960
Your mother was wondering
if you got dressed this morning

10:57.960 --> 11:02.000
with the specific intention
of showing your ass off to the entire world?

11:04.360 --> 11:06.840
It's because I woke up hoping to get
double teamed by a couple of 

11:06.840 --> 11:10.920
meth head truckers 
in some bathroom of a desert shithole.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.200
It's good that we got stuck here.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.960
I feel satisfied with that answer. 
I really do.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.040
I'm being punished for something, I know it.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.040
Shit.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.760
Next service in fifty miles.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.920
Fifty miles?

12:06.200 --> 12:10.840
Merry Christmas.
- What's so merry about it?

12:14.720 --> 12:17.600
You know that shit isn't good for the baby.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.640
Guess I should think
about quitting, then.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.320
Before you quit,
can I get one from you?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.320
You can buy a whole pack inside.

12:29.080 --> 12:33.320
How about I get one from you, and I give you 
two from the pack you're gonna sell me in there?

12:43.440 --> 12:46.120
I'm kind of lost.

12:46.720 --> 12:50.760
Am I right here?
- Not even close.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.240
Son of a bitch...

12:53.240 --> 12:56.520
Are there any phone around
here that actually work?

12:57.800 --> 13:00.720
Bob will probably let you use the diner phone
if you ask him nice.

13:00.720 --> 13:04.600
Maybe pay him a little something.
- I think I can handle that.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.040
You got anything in there to eat? 
Pancakes, or...

13:08.040 --> 13:11.120
Yup. We got a buttermilk
stack for three seventy-five,

13:11.120 --> 13:13.200
French toast for four
dollars if you're into that.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.720
Personally I like the pancakes though.

13:15.720 --> 13:19.720
You okay, Charlie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.760
This guy is just lost.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.920
Who is that?

13:34.920 --> 13:38.320
What do you want me to do?
- Talk to him.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.720
Things should have been
ready two goddamn hours ago.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.240
I hope Salem Lights are
all right, that's all we got left.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.160
Charlie, where have you been?

14:05.360 --> 14:08.440
It's not a resort, we've
got orders stacking up.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.000
You best not be smoking again.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.600
Not in your condition.
- Bob, see where I'm at right now?

14:14.600 --> 14:16.920
Can my condition really get any worse?

14:17.760 --> 14:23.320
Besides, you ain't one to talk.
- What? I quit two years ago.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.240
Yeah? So why are you still carrying that
fancy lighter around?

14:26.720 --> 14:29.920
It's a gift from my ex-wife...
I'm sentimental.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.840
I want to remember how much I hate her guts.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.920
Hey, man, you got a phone I can use?

14:34.920 --> 14:37.920
My cell phone ain't got no reception,
and the phone booth outside is busted. 

14:37.920 --> 14:40.880
Excuse me, is there any news about 
when our car might be fixed?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.320
You said your boy would have us back

14:42.320 --> 14:44.240
on the road two hours ago.
And I gotta say this...

14:44.440 --> 14:48.120
The rate we're going, we'll be lucky
to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas.

14:54.560 --> 14:59.840
Hey?! Hood's up on this beamer.
That mean anything to you?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.479
Yeah.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.880
What the hell are you working on that's so
damn important you're not doing your job?
-Nothing.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.720
I found it under a bunch of
stuff in the storage shed.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.880
I know you never liked
throw anything away so...

15:18.920 --> 15:22.120
What are you doing?
- What?

15:23.000 --> 15:28.840
Look Jeep, I like Charlie. I do.
And I think it's really nice you're

15:28.840 --> 15:32.040
giving her a helping hand... - Leave me alone!
- She's not your responsibility!

15:33.041 --> 15:38.179
Hey! Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you!

15:38.780 --> 15:42.100
How long you gonna follow her around 
like a little puppy dog looking for higher teet?

15:42.100 --> 15:45.460
Cleaning up whole mess work she makes while 
she steps out with every guy but you?

15:45.460 --> 15:48.940
Don't say that about her!
She's not like that.

15:57.500 --> 16:00.340
Look. I know it doesn't make
much sense to you.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.300
I know it doesn't make sense to me either.

16:07.740 --> 16:10.660
I've been having these
dreams about her.

16:10.660 --> 16:13.140
Some of them so bad...

16:13.140 --> 16:15.740
I wish I'd never have
to sleep again.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.660
I can't explain it, dad.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.740
I just feel like it's
something I got to do.

16:27.460 --> 16:33.780
You know your mother thought 
I was crazy wanting to buy this place..

16:33.780 --> 16:37.300
Moving us all the way up here, in the middle of nowhere.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.300
But I just knew it was
something I had to do.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.460
I couldn't explain it either.
Just like you.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.740
I told your mother: "Trust me".

16:45.740 --> 16:49.460
"You just wait and see,
when they build that big mall out there,

16:49.460 --> 16:54.500
with all the superstores like they've been planning 
on for years, this place is going to be a goldmine."

16:54.900 --> 16:58.060
Only problem was: I was wrong.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.500
They went and built the whole 
damned thing in another county,

17:00.500 --> 17:03.660
and I looked pretty damn stupid.

17:05.740 --> 17:08.660
And I see you making
the same damn mistake I made.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.859
Believing in something that's
never going to happen.

17:13.300 --> 17:18.220
You listen to me, son. It's
time for you to leave here.

17:18.220 --> 17:21.819
I don't want to see you wake up one day

17:21.819 --> 17:25.380
old and pissed off, realizing you're lost,

17:25.380 --> 17:28.339
just like everybody else
that stops here.

17:33.060 --> 17:35.740
Go on. Fix the car.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.360
I want these people out
of here by nightfall.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.120
He's about this close
to wrapping it up.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.640
What is wrong with you today?

18:28.880 --> 18:32.000
I told you to get the satellite TV.
But you didn't want to listen.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.760
What the hell do I need that crap for?
- The History Channel, man.

18:35.760 --> 18:38.160
I got all the history I can take.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.600
That's for sure.
- What's your beef now?

18:41.600 --> 18:44.480
You don’t need to be
watching this anyway.

18:44.480 --> 18:48.480
All right baby. This is
gonna be it, right here.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.440
Clear as day.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.240
What the hell is that?

19:00.040 --> 19:02.120
Well, they're testing something.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.040
"This is not a test"

19:04.040 --> 19:08.600
That doesn't look like a test. 
- Can I just use the phone?

19:10.580 --> 19:13.060
It's back past the kitchen. 

19:13.060 --> 19:15.300
Excuse me, but if this
were an actual emergency,

19:15.300 --> 19:19.580
wouldn't they be giving us
instructions on what to do?

19:20.060 --> 19:25.020
Percy, check out that old radio of yours,
see if there's any news about the TV.

19:52.020 --> 19:54.220
Put my little man on the phone.

19:56.380 --> 20:00.580
Because a father is supposed to be able
to talk to his son, that’s why.

20:01.620 --> 20:07.140
I don't care what your lawyer said, I got my own lawyer,
now put him on the god damn phone.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.260
Hello?

20:10.460 --> 20:13.060
Your phone is breaking
up, do you hear me?

20:15.580 --> 20:17.500
Shit.

20:21.940 --> 20:25.100
Maybe there was an earthquake.
- A lot of people in the desert.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.600
Not if it was centered in the desert.
- Yeah, could be nothing to worry about.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.560
So why is the TV out?
- Maybe it was terrorists.

20:34.600 --> 20:38.480
Oh God.
- For crying out loud, there's no use speculating.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.960
I'll just call my brother up in Needles,
he'll probably know something.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.960
I don't think so.
- What do you mean?

20:43.960 --> 20:48.280
I was just on the phone,
the shit cut off in the middle of my conversation. 

20:48.280 --> 20:52.000
I want my money back.
- This is perfect,absolutely perfect.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.520
Hey hey, everybody.
Simmer down.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.480
There's nothing to get excited about,
they're probably just working on the lines.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.920
Besides, Jeep's going to have your car fixed in a jiffy,
then you can be on your way, so...

21:02.920 --> 21:04.840
Good.

21:56.380 --> 21:59.820
Have a seat wherever you want ma'am.
Specials are on the board.

22:06.060 --> 22:09.860
I already know what I want.
- Okay. What will it be?

22:09.860 --> 22:12.420
I'll have a steak, please.
- How would you like it?

22:12.420 --> 22:14.780
Rare, if you would.
And water, no ice.

22:14.820 --> 22:18.220
Coming right up.
- Charlie, is it?

22:18.220 --> 22:21.780
Yeah.
- Unusual name for a girl.

22:21.780 --> 22:24.740
So they say. I'll be right
back with your water.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.980
Hello, I'm Gladys.
Gladys Foster.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.700
Oh, hello Gladys, it's
so nice to meet you.

22:31.700 --> 22:35.060
I'm Sandra. And this is
my husband, Howard.

22:35.060 --> 22:38.020
What a nice looking young couple.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.460
What brings you up to these parts?

22:40.460 --> 22:46.660
We're on our way to Scottsdale, but our car
broke down and we're stuck here until it's fixed.

22:47.260 --> 22:49.380
What a nuisance.

22:49.380 --> 22:51.980
Gladys, the lines seem to
be down around here,

22:51.980 --> 22:56.180
the phone and the TV and I was just wondering
if you might have heard something on your way up,

22:56.460 --> 22:58.540
about what's going on?

22:58.540 --> 23:00.980
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that, sweetheart.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.860
It'll all be over soon.
Okay.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.820
So what are we looking at?
- I don't know.

23:16.860 --> 23:20.300
It's probably something wrong with the computer, 
but we don't have the gear to test it here.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.220
Oh, shit.

23:23.180 --> 23:25.180
They're gonna be pissed.

23:25.180 --> 23:28.900
Just tell them we'll
call it in and tow it.

23:28.900 --> 23:32.060
That's not gonna happen.
The phone's out.

23:32.060 --> 23:33.980
What?
- Yeah.

23:35.840 --> 23:40.280
Thank you, dear. 
How far along are you?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.520
Oh, just about there.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.640
The father must be very proud.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.280
I wouldn't know. He's
out of sight, out of mind.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.200
I see.

23:50.960 --> 23:54.040
So I take it you're not married?
- No.

23:54.040 --> 23:57.680
That's too bad.
- No, I prefer it that way.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.680
I don't need a man telling me what to do.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.640
But what about the baby?
- I've got it under control.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.080
But it's gonna burn.

24:06.640 --> 24:11.240
What did you just say? 
- I said your fucking baby's gonna burn.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.680
Go to hell, lady.

24:19.520 --> 24:22.280
Fucking Jesus freak.
- What happened?

24:28.920 --> 24:30.960
All little babies are gonna burn.
- Gladys...

24:35.360 --> 24:39.600
Shut up you stupid fucking cunt.
All you do is complain, complain, complain! 

24:39.600 --> 24:41.520
What?

24:41.520 --> 24:44.040
What? What?
- Harold, no...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.640
I don't know who the hell you think you are,
but I'd like you to apologize to my...

24:56.240 --> 24:58.280
You're all going to fucking die!

25:15.160 --> 25:17.160
What the fuck, man?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.920
Shoot her, Jeep!

25:34.240 --> 25:36.880
You will never save her.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.360
Upucaj kuju!

25:40.320 --> 25:42.240
Shoot that bitch!

26:01.400 --> 26:03.320
Somebody help me!

26:07.480 --> 26:11.520
Don't look at me like that.
I’m trying to help.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.160
Calm down. 
Keep pressure on his neck.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.120
Easy.

27:07.560 --> 27:10.040
How far is it to the hospital?
- How the hell did she do that ?

27:10.040 --> 27:13.320
I don't know. I don't know.
- 70, maybe 80 miles.

27:13.320 --> 27:16.920
80 miles? I'll get there as soon as
I can but I can't steer.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.640
Please drive faster.
- Okay.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.600
What the hell is that?

27:31.240 --> 27:33.200
It's clouds, what do you think they are?

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
Clouds don't buzz!

27:54.400 --> 27:58.920
I can't believe she was still standing after Percy
hit her with that frying pan.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.360
He broke her fucking
neck, I saw it, I swear.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.640
Did you see the gun that guy had?

28:06.640 --> 28:08.920
What's a guy doing with a gun like that?

28:12.280 --> 28:15.880
Hey, Jeep. It's alright, son.

28:16.720 --> 28:20.680
I couldn't pull the trigger. 
I froze.

28:22.880 --> 28:28.320
I saw what I needed to do.
But I was too afraid.

28:30.720 --> 28:34.160
She would've killed you.
She would've killed Charlie.

28:34.160 --> 28:37.440
Hey! You ain't got nothing
to be ashamed of...

28:37.440 --> 28:40.040
You hear me, son?

28:40.040 --> 28:42.520
Not everybody can play the hero.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.160
Especially when it comes
to pulling the trigger.

28:54.280 --> 28:58.080
What happened?
What's going on?

28:58.080 --> 29:00.040
Gonna get my Bible!
- What for?

29:00.040 --> 29:02.040
Somebody's gotta start praying.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.800
Jesus, she's burning up.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.600
How is that possible?
She's been dead for an hour.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.240
I don't care how long she's been dead.
The bitch just walked on the ceiling.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.520
She ain't staying in here.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.440
The old bitch is heavy.
Hold her up.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.480
Where are the flies?
- How am I supposed to know?

29:35.480 --> 29:38.960
Are you asking me to explain the behavior 
of a motherfucking pestilence?

29:40.600 --> 29:43.720
Hey. Somebody's coming.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.880
Što sad?

29:48.960 --> 29:53.320
All right. Now we're talking.
- Wait a second ? LAPD?

29:55.800 --> 29:58.840
I'm from Vegas, man.
- Give me the gun.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.200
Oh my God.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.760
Charlie, wait.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.520
Take one more step and
I'll drop you right there.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.440
Is that how you greet
all your customers?

30:34.480 --> 30:36.920
Mister, after what we've been through 

30:36.920 --> 30:39.400
you're lucky we don't shoot you first
and greet you later.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.120
Let me see your teeth.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.560
Teeth, goddamn it!
Let me see them!

30:49.520 --> 30:51.560
No sharp teeth, Pop.

30:52.360 --> 30:56.080
Okay then, how about
you tell us your name?

30:56.080 --> 30:58.000
Michael.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.520
Sorry about that, Michael.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.760
We had this old lady here,
went crazy in my place.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.520
She had these teeth. 
Never seen anything like it.

31:09.520 --> 31:12.080
Practically bit a man in half.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.800
What are you doing out here, anyway?

31:14.800 --> 31:17.840
You don't look like any
policeman I ever saw.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.880
Even the ones from L.A.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.480
Ali mora biti, je li tako?

31:23.480 --> 31:26.640
But he's got to be, right?
Who'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car?

31:30.080 --> 31:33.440
You don't know, do you?
- Don't know what?

31:33.440 --> 31:35.560
We don't know anything.
Nothing works, 

31:35.560 --> 31:37.360
the TV, the radio, the phone.

31:37.360 --> 31:41.320
I'm running out of time.
- Hold on there, fella.

31:41.320 --> 31:44.280
You better start talking or
get the hell out of here.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.200
Dad, just tell him you're sorry.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.440
Now I'm sure you don't
want to go spilling blood

31:59.440 --> 32:03.320
for no good reason, in front
of all these decent people.

32:03.320 --> 32:08.920
What do you say? Just let Bob go and then
you will be on your way, nice and easy.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.920
They're here.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.040
You're gonna need this.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.920
Wait, who's here?
- More like her.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.360
What do you mean like her?

32:44.080 --> 32:46.680
Hold on. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

32:46.680 --> 32:50.600
Dad, I can handle it.
- He can handle it.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.600
He doesn't have a choice.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.280
Don't do anything brave.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.200
What's happening?
- Better get back inside.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.800
Jeep, come on!

33:51.660 --> 33:53.700
Everybody stay calm!

33:58.420 --> 34:00.900
Okay, we're locked in here,
so what the fuck we're doin' now?

34:20.659 --> 34:24.100
All right, Rambo. You got us up here.
You mind telling us what we're fighting?

34:24.100 --> 34:26.659
Listen!

34:27.620 --> 34:29.620
You hear what I'm hearing?

34:33.659 --> 34:37.260
What the hell is that?
- Sounds almost like...

34:37.260 --> 34:39.260
Ice cream?

34:45.940 --> 34:47.860
Can't be fucking serious, right?

34:48.179 --> 34:50.940
There's a safety switch on the side of your weapon, 

34:50.940 --> 34:52.980
push it all the way down., two clicks.

34:52.980 --> 34:54.980
Now when this starts, you hold on tight.

34:54.980 --> 35:00.900
Otherwise you're gonna blow your hand off.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.900
What the fuck are you all looking at me for?

35:27.460 --> 35:34.860
Audrey. Honey, listen.
It's the Ice Cream Man.

36:09.780 --> 36:11.900
Oh, man, he don't look that bad.

36:12.940 --> 36:14.860
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

36:16.620 --> 36:18.540
Oh, damn it!

36:18.540 --> 36:20.460
Get ready.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.960
Is that it?

37:06.480 --> 37:08.400
Now! Shoot now!

38:33.520 --> 38:37.040
They're just regular people.
- Not anymore! Keep firing!

38:56.860 --> 38:58.980
Don't let them get near the windows.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.120
Howard!

39:33.980 --> 39:36.220
See what you made me do, mother?

39:47.600 --> 39:49.520
There you are!

40:11.120 --> 40:13.800
We got them running.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.320
Let me go! He's alive!
He's out there!

40:17.320 --> 40:20.840
He's out there.
- He's gone.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.080
You okay?

40:29.560 --> 40:31.480
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.200
Thanks.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.120
I told you not to do anything brave.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.080
We got them running.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.440
What happened?
- Someone needs to be on the roof.

40:50.940 --> 40:53.020
I'll go.
- Hold on.

40:55.180 --> 40:57.260
You better start talking.

41:02.780 --> 41:08.820
The last time God lost faith
in man he sent a flood.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.180
This time, he sent
what you see outside.

41:13.180 --> 41:15.620
Are you saying this is the Apocalypse?

41:15.620 --> 41:18.140
I'm saying this is an extermination.

41:19.260 --> 41:22.100
Those things outside are just vessels,

41:22.380 --> 41:25.900
they're possessed ,
the weakest willed are the easiest to turn.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.380
Possessed by what?
Demons?

41:29.380 --> 41:31.300
No...

41:34.980 --> 41:37.700
By angels.

41:37.900 --> 41:42.500
Hold on. I don't know what
book you've been reading

41:42.500 --> 41:47.980
but in my version the
angels are good guys.

41:47.980 --> 41:50.580
Well the truth, I'm afraid,
is never that simple.

41:50.580 --> 41:54.020
Bullshit. I'm not a pastor,
but I've never heard of no

41:54.020 --> 41:58.740
Ice Cream Man, or old lady eating raw meat,
jumping on the ceiling with baby teeth.

41:58.740 --> 42:03.660
So I don't know what the so much about them?
- Hold on. How do you know so much about them?

42:04.460 --> 42:07.380
Because until last night,
I was on their side.

42:07.380 --> 42:09.300
So you're saying you...
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

42:09.300 --> 42:11.740
Yesterday I was fucking Santa Claus.

42:11.740 --> 42:15.260
You know this is crazy, right?
I mean....

42:15.260 --> 42:17.180
I don't even believe in God.

42:17.180 --> 42:19.980
Well that's just fine, Bob, he
doesn't believe in you either.

42:20.340 --> 42:23.340
He doesn't believe in
any of this anymore.

42:23.340 --> 42:26.860
I knew this day was coming,
I just didn't think I'd be around to see it.

42:26.860 --> 42:29.100
Come on, Percy!
What are we even talking about this for?

42:29.100 --> 42:34.740
Angels, and possessed people.
It's not real! It's...

42:34.740 --> 42:37.100
Have you looked outside, Bob?

42:37.380 --> 42:42.580
I mean , those people aren't exactly
our regular customers!

42:44.760 --> 42:47.280
So, are you here to protect us?

42:47.920 --> 42:49.840
No, not you.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.520
Her.

42:53.040 --> 42:56.160
Me? 
Why me?

42:56.160 --> 43:00.040
Because your child is the
only hope humanity has of survival.

43:08.480 --> 43:10.880
Wait just a minute, 
this can't be happening

43:10.880 --> 43:13.160
I'm nobody, 
I'm just a waitress.

43:15.120 --> 43:18.640
I don't even own a car.
- None of that matters anymore.

43:18.640 --> 43:21.720
Either your child lives
or mankind dies.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.280
So we're supposed to hold those things off
until the baby gets here?

43:26.280 --> 43:28.200
That's it.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.120
I'm only eight months pregnant.

43:30.120 --> 43:32.040
This shit can't be happening, man.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.920
How are we supposed to
survive here for a month?

43:34.920 --> 43:37.120
We won't have to.

43:39.080 --> 43:42.560
It's coming soon, isn't it?
- Yes.

43:45.100 --> 43:49.300
Listen. I simply don't care
what you people believe.

43:49.300 --> 43:51.660
And those things outside,
they don't care either.

43:51.660 --> 43:54.180
They just want the child dead. 

43:55.500 --> 43:58.020
Now, this first attack was
a test of our strength.

43:58.020 --> 44:01.260
The next will be a test
of our weakness.

44:01.820 --> 44:04.420
Now we can sit here and discuss it 

44:04.420 --> 44:06.620
or you can try to help me.

44:06.980 --> 44:12.460
But believe me. Something
much worse is on the way.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.540
Sons of bitches.

44:26.060 --> 44:28.620
They're out there,
I can feel them.

44:35.140 --> 44:39.140
So what's with that gun?
- What?

44:39.140 --> 44:43.540
Your piece. The one you
killed grandma with.

44:43.540 --> 44:46.340
Don't reckon it's for
hunting buck.

44:48.300 --> 44:53.260
I use it for protection.
- Protection from what?

44:53.260 --> 44:55.620
From people.
- People?

44:57.300 --> 45:01.180
People that be starting shit.
- Regular people, or just...

45:01.180 --> 45:05.020
No. Not regular regular
people, but you know...

45:05.020 --> 45:07.260
Irregular people, then.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.440
Get the fuck out of here, man.

45:11.800 --> 45:15.280
I got my reasons for doing
what I do, and that's that.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.560
I've never actually
used it, all right?

45:30.320 --> 45:34.840
I may have flashed it, scared a few
folks but, 

45:34.840 --> 45:37.920
it never actually fired off.

45:40.680 --> 45:42.720
Not until today.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.800
This shit is crazy, man.

45:55.200 --> 45:57.320
When I was a kid...

45:57.320 --> 46:01.000
my father would sit by my bed every night

46:01.000 --> 46:03.560
before I went to sleep.

46:06.200 --> 46:10.280
And he'd say to me:

46:12.720 --> 46:19.440
"Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow,

46:21.200 --> 46:27.280
if it turns out that today

46:27.280 --> 46:31.120
is your last day on earth.

46:32.160 --> 46:35.640
Will you be proud of 

46:35.640 --> 46:38.560
what you've done in this life?

46:40.840 --> 46:46.080
cuz if you ain't...

46:47.960 --> 46:52.240
you better start
getting square."

47:07.760 --> 47:09.680
Fuck it.

47:25.920 --> 47:29.440
On the house.
- Thank you.

47:33.200 --> 47:36.640
You hungry?
- No.

47:37.240 --> 47:41.040
Just because it's the end of the world
doesn't mean you have to starve.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.520
I'm just happy we still have the gas on.

47:56.460 --> 47:59.500
I never really cared much for beer..

48:01.460 --> 48:04.420
Howard was the beer 
drinker in the family.

48:17.340 --> 48:23.500
So what did you do? 
You know before you came here.

48:23.900 --> 48:29.700
I was a soldier.
A general in His army.

48:32.980 --> 48:36.340
So what changed?
What made you leave?

48:36.660 --> 48:39.380
I was given an order
I didn't believe in.

48:42.020 --> 48:45.820
He lost faith. 
I didn't.

48:52.340 --> 48:54.780
How come you still have faith?

48:54.780 --> 48:59.460
I mean, seems like everything I have faith in

48:59.460 --> 49:01.980
cost me nothin but trouble.

49:08.060 --> 49:12.740
When God chose your kind

49:12.740 --> 49:17.420
as the object of his love....

49:17.420 --> 49:21.660
I was the first in all of heaven
to bow down before you.

49:23.660 --> 49:30.300
My love and my hope for
mankind hasn't lessened yet.

49:33.980 --> 49:37.860
But I have watched you trample that gift.

49:37.860 --> 49:42.180
I've watched you kill each
other over race and greed.

49:42.180 --> 49:46.940
Waging war over dust, rubble
and words in old books.

49:46.940 --> 49:52.060
And yet in the midst of all this darkness

49:52.060 --> 49:54.820
I see some people who will not be bowed.

49:57.180 --> 50:02.180
I see some people
who will not give up.

50:02.700 --> 50:05.740
Even when they know hope is lost.

50:08.040 --> 50:11.920
Some people, who realize that being

50:11.920 --> 50:15.800
lost is so close to being found.

50:17.360 --> 50:19.920
I see you, Jeep.

50:20.720 --> 50:25.160
Fifteen years old, your mother leaves you,
your father withdraws from the world.

50:25.600 --> 50:28.320
And you spend the next five years of your life

50:28.320 --> 50:30.480
helping him find his way home.

50:32.680 --> 50:35.160
You love a woman, who has the child of another,

50:35.160 --> 50:37.760
and you love her making a fool of yourself.

50:39.120 --> 50:41.600
Even though you know she may never
love you the way you love her.

50:44.200 --> 50:47.240
You, Jeep.

50:49.080 --> 50:52.640
You are the reason I still have faith.

50:58.040 --> 51:00.560
It's almost time for the next shift.

51:51.020 --> 51:53.420
You have a question?

51:54.780 --> 51:59.140
I question myself.
So should you.

52:02.780 --> 52:05.860
Since their creation, He's
told us only to love them.

52:08.300 --> 52:10.220
I can not stop.

52:12.220 --> 52:15.940
They brought this judgment upon themselves.
- They are just lost.

52:17.020 --> 52:19.260
It's our place to guide them.

52:19.260 --> 52:21.980
It's my place to obey.

52:22.500 --> 52:25.380
Tell me, Gabriel. 
Do you wish to give Him what 

52:25.380 --> 52:28.300
He wants...or what He needs?

52:28.820 --> 52:32.020
It's not your test, Michael.

52:32.020 --> 52:35.860
How dare you listen to His heart?
- Because He made this one.

52:36.780 --> 52:39.820
It tells me we shouldn't
lose faith now.

52:41.900 --> 52:46.780
It's too late. 
The order has been given.

52:46.780 --> 52:51.220
The weak will turn against the strong,
and we will undo what has been done?

52:51.520 --> 52:54.560
And if you defy Him...

52:54.560 --> 52:57.600
You'll anger Him for the last time.

52:58.240 --> 53:01.040
What if I failed...

53:01.040 --> 53:04.680
Lord's coming to man whether he wishes or not.

53:04.680 --> 53:08.240
The dogs of heaven will be released.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.800
<i>Sandra</i>

53:42.840 --> 53:45.040
<i>Sandra</i>

54:13.900 --> 54:15.820
Howarde?

54:38.980 --> 54:40.980
Howarde.

54:57.820 --> 54:59.740
Help me!

55:04.140 --> 55:08.260
What are you doing?
- He's alive! Let me go!

55:15.540 --> 55:18.140
Mom, what are you doing?
Mom, stop!

55:18.140 --> 55:19.500
Your father is alive!
- He's not, mom!

55:19.500 --> 55:21.420
Let go of me!
God!

55:43.940 --> 55:45.860
No, don't!

55:49.640 --> 55:51.560
Percy?

56:09.860 --> 56:13.700
It's my fault.
I fell asleep.

56:14.580 --> 56:16.780
Dad...
- Don't!

56:20.340 --> 56:24.940
I did this he trusted me.

56:24.940 --> 56:27.900
Just like your mother, I let him down.

56:28.100 --> 56:30.180
Let everybody down.

56:44.900 --> 56:49.620
Here. Mom, If you take
these you'll feel better, Ok?

57:08.400 --> 57:10.520
This is your fault.

57:11.240 --> 57:14.280
We were only here because of you.

57:14.280 --> 57:17.920
We sacrificed everything for you.

57:17.920 --> 57:22.960
No. You wanted to go.
You said you wanted.

57:22.960 --> 57:25.040
I loved my house.

57:26.200 --> 57:29.400
I loved my life, 
and you have ruined it.

57:30.240 --> 57:32.640
You ruined everything!

57:32.880 --> 57:35.320
Everything!
- Enough.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.120
You're just gonna sit here
and torture your daughter like this?

57:39.120 --> 57:42.640
Can you come help me
find a station that actually works?

58:04.960 --> 58:09.320
Wait! Guys, almost got it...
I'm hearin' something!

58:10.460 --> 58:12.820
<i>If you're hearing my voice,
we're getting the first bits</i>

58:12.820 --> 58:16.940
<i>of good news since this
Apocalypse began,</i>

58:16.940 --> 58:19.300
<i>nearly 48 hours ago.</i>

58:19.300 --> 58:22.020
<i>A militia has formed on
the outskirts of Las Vegas</i>

58:22.020 --> 58:24.740
<i>and has begun to
engage those affected.</i>

58:24.740 --> 58:28.220
<i>Getting unconfirmed reports
of other militias gathering</i>

58:28.220 --> 58:32.260
<i>in Death Valley, Zion and
Red Ridge National Park.</i>

58:32.260 --> 58:34.180
Red Ridge, that's only
an hour from here.

58:34.180 --> 58:36.220
Does that mean we can leave?
- No.

58:37.420 --> 58:39.900
We're not going anywhere.
- What?

58:39.900 --> 58:43.020
I don't know about you,
but I gotta get fuck out of here.

58:45.420 --> 58:48.660
I won't risk being on the
move when the baby comes.

58:50.180 --> 58:52.180
It's too dangerous.

58:57.100 --> 59:01.260
Dangerous? 
What the fuck you mean too dangerous?

59:02.360 --> 59:05.960
<i>...strength to survive. And
have mercy for those</i>

59:05.960 --> 59:07.880
<i>who are already lost.</i>

59:41.400 --> 59:43.320
You okay?

59:46.920 --> 59:49.720
The craziest thing is
I don't want this baby.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.120
I even went down to the
clinic, did you know that?

59:56.320 --> 59:58.800
I remember sitting in
the waiting room...

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.760
absolutely sure I was
doing the right thing.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.000
Then I started getting this feeling...

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.320
Like if I was, falling into the deepest, 
darkest hole imaginable.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.480
I couldn't breathe and
either couldn't speak.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:28.000
I kept thinking this must be
what death feels like.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.200
And when they called my name,
I just ran.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.740
For a long time I...

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.420
I always thought that I could
go back whenever I'd want.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.620
And end it like,
I'd planned.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:57.500
But then I started getting
that damn feeling again

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.420
I knew I had no choice.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.300
Somehow this had already been decided.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.460
It made me just...

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:17.500
Made me hate this
thing growing inside me.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:22.020
You shouldn't say
things like that, Charlie.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.700
It ain't right. 
You'll get through this, 

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.020
I know you will..

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.940
Why do you have so much
faith in me, Jeep?

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.060
God knows I've never given
you or anybody a reason to.

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.740
Or is it just that you don't have any other
hard-luck cases to follow around, is that it?

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:52.980
No. You're not the only one who’s
had it hard around here, okay?

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.860
Let me know when you stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:10.980
So now you just have to...
- Two clicks. All the way down.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.480
I dated a marine last summer.
He was kind of a gun freak.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.040
My parents hated him.
- I bet they did.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.000
My mom was right. It is
my fault we are here.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.760
She didn't mean that.
- Yes, she did...

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.680
It's true.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.040
I mean the only reason why we're
moving is because of me.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.880
They thought my friends
were a bad influence.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.280
But I was the bad influence.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.960
So really fucked up.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.280
When I was a shorty, the
only time my old man ever

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.640
gave me attention was
when I did something bad.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.800
So you know what I did, right?
- What?

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.560
I got really good at being bad.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.960
The problem is, when you get older,
when you have a family,

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.400
being bad is not so good.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.840
Is it over?

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.160
Are we back in business?
- No, I don't think so.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.600
You better go downstairs
- No, I can handle it.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.920
Get downstairs.
- No. I can handle it.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.920
Take this, just in case.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.560
Get ready.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.800
Wait a minute.
- Kyle, are they...?

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.840
Kyle!

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.240
It's a trap! 

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.400
They see them coming
and turn their lights on.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.520
Hey! Get back in your car!
Get back in your car!

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
<i>Daddy!<i></i></i>

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.880
They not gonna make it!

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.080
Get in the car!

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.480
Don't, you're gonna hit him!

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.640
What the hell is that guy doing? 

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.320
Don't open the door.
If you do, we all die.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.960
Now what?

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.460
Fooled you.

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.580
Damn it to hell!

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.580
Oh no. Audrey.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.980
You're gonna die now.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:46.740
She's just a kid,
you can't let her die.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.300
I swear if you don't
do something, I will.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.300
Wait. You stay here.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.740
Open the door.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.220
Come on!
Run!

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.620
I'll get some water.
- Jeep!

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:08.180
Don't be scared. I just want
to play with your baby.

01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:34.140
Are you hurt?
- Where is he?

01:08:54.979 --> 01:08:56.899
What the hell?

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.620
Oh God.

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.580
It's coming.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.580
Wait , just because I'm a girl does not mean
I know how to do this.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:25.340
Be calm and do exactly as I tell you.
- How do you know what to do?

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.500
Koji naèin za donošenje
djeteta na svijet.

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.500
What the fuck is that?
- He's coming.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.420
We need to hurry now.
- What do you mean hurry?

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.380
This isn't exactly something we can hurry.
- Charlie, I need you to push now.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.020
You push like you never pushed before.
Push!

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.500
Michael, who is coming?
- Push!

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:12.140
How many bullets do you have left?

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:17.660
Come on!
That’s good!

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.460
Charlie, you did it!

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.020
You did it.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.460
It's okay, no,

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.820
it's okay, your baby is fine. 
Look.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.980
It's all right.
Give her some time.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.940
Audrey.

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.300
Mom...
It's here , he is alive.

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.300
He's beautiful.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.260
I remember when you were a baby..

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:10.540
You used to look at me just like that, 

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.500
just like that.

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.580
Audrey, I'm sorry about
what I said to you before.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:19.740
I didn't mean it.
- Yeah.

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:22.980
You're the most precious
thing in the world to me.

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.900
It's just you and me now.
- I know.

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.860
Are we safe now?
- No.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.060
Now, at least, the child
will have a chance...

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.140
to grow up.

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:52.420
A chance to lead the
world out of darkness.

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.140
What happens until then?

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.900
You'll need to show him how.

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.420
What makes you think I can do that?

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:08.580
What makes you think I want to do that?

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.180
If he's so important,
why don't you take him?

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.860
Because his journey is yours.

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.260
Michael, we need to go.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.940
The possessed can't go near the child, 
but he sent someone who can, someone like me.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.400
Like you?
- Gabriel.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.800
He's come here to do
what I wouldn't.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.480
You were the one who was
supposed to kill the baby?

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.920
That's the order you didn't obey?

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.840
We need to go.
- What is he talking about?

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.160
Go grab whatever weapons we have left.
- What are you talking about?

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.400
We need to go now!
- Tell me! - Now!

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.840
The baby. The baby was
never meant to be born.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.040
But the future has been unwritten.
The child lives.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.040
And while he does, there's still hope.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.760
Audrey!

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.800
Mom!
- Come, come.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.720
What are you doing?
- I heard them say.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.680
They just want the baby.
I'm gonna give them the baby.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.640
Then they'll let us go!
- Give him back to me!

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.440
Why!? You didn't even want
him in the first place!

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.120
Come on, Audrey.
Audrey, come with me!

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.080
It's just one baby.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.960
It's just one baby.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.240
No!

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.320
No, Jeep, not now!

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.040
The child! Get the
child out of here!

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.800
What about you?
- Don't be afraid.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.720
Find the Prophets. Learn to
read the instructions.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.080
Prophets? What Prophets? What instructions?
- Go!

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.920
I knew he'd send you, Gabriel.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.360
You were always so eager to please Him.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:55.000
Unlike you.
The rebellious son.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:13.280
Your wings. They would
have helped you now.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.200
To not feel that burden is a dream.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:31.000
You think you can defy Him
and not pay the price?

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.660
The child lives.

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:40.940
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.780
Yours is a fools sacrifice, Michael.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.820
You can help them run
but they won't escape.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.060
Neither will you, my brother.

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:04.500
I'm not running anymore.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.480
That's enough.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.680
There's another way.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.960
There is no other way.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.280
That's enough.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.760
You wanted to live like one of them.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.760
Now you die like one of them.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.520
Jeep. Your arm.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.920
The instructions.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.600
Sorry. We're out of business.

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.400
We're here.

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.640
Okay ,we need to figure out
our weapon situation.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.120
Hopefully Michael didn't take
everything out of the car.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.040
Look around.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.280
I've got a flare gun and a couple of...

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.680
Audrey, flare gun!

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.160
Do it!

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.880
Jeep, do it!

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.940
Jeep?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.300
The baby?
- Alive.

01:23:37.601 --> 01:23:39.252
Audrey?

01:24:17.765 --> 01:24:19.407
Give me the child.

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:26.900
No.

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.980
Then death will come to you both.

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.740
No!

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.420
Why do you continue to fight?

01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:52.260
When you know all hope is lost.

01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.980
Fuck you.

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:12.020
This can't be.
You've disobeyed Him.

01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.100
You gave Him what he asked.

01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.020
I gave Him what he needed.

01:25:45.071 --> 01:25:46.382
Kill me.

01:25:51.739 --> 01:25:53.416
Kill me!

01:25:53.834 --> 01:25:55.634
Just kill me!

01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:58.059
No.

01:26:04.636 --> 01:26:06.936
I wouldn't have shown you such mercy.

01:26:08.237 --> 01:26:09.937
I know.

01:26:10.738 --> 01:26:12.838
That's why you have failed Him.

01:26:27.639 --> 01:26:29.839
They are waiting for you.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.840
- Where are you going?
- Don't ask. It's your job to keep the baby safe now.

01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:35.141
Will I see you again?

01:26:36.342 --> 01:26:38.442
Have faith.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.200
When I was a little girl, 
my mother spoke of a prophecy.

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:20.140
Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness
and the fate of mankind would be decided.

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.260
One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:25.380
why God was so mad
at his children.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.100
"I don't know," she said,
tucking the covers around me,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.900
"I guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."
