<i>NARRATOR: Tonight on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.420 --> 00:04.920
Looks like we got
something, boys!

00:05.079 --> 00:06.496
Two pieces of wood.

00:06.589 --> 00:09.249
The only thing usually that
will give us that is a tunnel.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.260
So, we ran C-14 on it.

00:11.419 --> 00:13.754
One time frame-- old, old, old.

00:13.838 --> 00:15.505
(horn honks)

00:15.598 --> 00:17.924
<i>MARTY: We are about
to embark on the attempt</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:20.260
<i>to recover valuables
lurking in the Money Pit.</i>

00:20.344 --> 00:21.261
CHARLES:
Here they come!

00:21.354 --> 00:22.771
<i>MARTY:
We've got ten-foot cans</i>

00:22.930 --> 00:24.598
<i>coming in and we can dig it up.</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:27.192
There is definitely, without
a doubt, gold down there.

00:27.351 --> 00:28.318
(laughs)

00:30.855 --> 00:32.355
<i>NARRATOR:
There is an island</i>

00:32.440 --> 00:34.608
<i>in the North Atlantic...</i>

00:34.692 --> 00:38.028
<i>where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure</i>

00:38.112 --> 00:40.530
<i>for more than 200 years.</i>

00:40.615 --> 00:43.959
<i>So far, they have found
a stone slab</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:46.045
<i>with strange symbols
carved into it...</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:50.040
<i>manmade workings
that date to medieval times...</i>

00:50.124 --> 00:52.125
<i>and a lead cross</i>

00:52.218 --> 00:56.138
<i>whose origin may be connected
to the Knights Templar.</i>

00:56.297 --> 00:58.965
<i>To date, six men have died</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:01.885
<i>trying to solve the mystery.</i>

01:01.969 --> 01:03.645
<i>And according to legend,</i>

01:03.805 --> 01:07.224
<i>one more will have to die</i>

01:07.317 --> 01:10.402
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

01:22.406 --> 01:24.666
<i>MARTY:
This is an important meeting.</i>

01:24.751 --> 01:26.993
Because we are about to embark

01:27.087 --> 01:30.413
on the real beginning
this year of the treasure hunt.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.250
The attempt
to recover valuables,

01:33.334 --> 01:36.670
important artifacts, stories--
Whatever may be still

01:36.763 --> 01:39.172
lurking in the Money Pit,
we're, we're about to begin.

01:39.265 --> 01:42.017
Yep. This is the year.

01:42.176 --> 01:44.186
I've never been
more excited in my life.

01:44.345 --> 01:46.680
<i>NARRATOR:
As an exciting new day</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:48.265
<i>dawns on Oak Island.</i>

01:48.358 --> 01:50.267
So, anyway,
the dig is about to begin.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.852
And I'm wearing my lucky toonie.

01:51.936 --> 01:55.280
I'm wearing it for luck.
And I hope it works.

01:55.439 --> 01:58.367
<i>NARRATOR: Brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina are meeting</i>

01:58.526 --> 02:00.777
<i>with their partner Craig Tester</i>

02:00.862 --> 02:03.029
<i>and other members
of their team in the war room</i>

02:03.114 --> 02:04.706
<i>to plan the most strategic</i>

02:04.791 --> 02:06.875
<i>excavation ever conducted
in the Money Pit</i>

02:07.034 --> 02:09.286
<i>since the treasure mystery began</i>

02:09.370 --> 02:11.872
<i>227 years ago.</i>

02:11.965 --> 02:15.134
Basically, we have to have a,
uh, an idea of who's doing what,

02:15.218 --> 02:16.885
how the logistics
are gonna work.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.637
There's gonna be a whole bunch

02:18.796 --> 02:20.806
of materials moved,
a bunch of metal detecting,

02:20.965 --> 02:23.225
a bunch of washing.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.060
So I'm gonna turn it over
to big brother here.

02:25.219 --> 02:27.396
- So go ahead, Rick.
- Well...

02:27.555 --> 02:29.648
the first thing I want
to speak of is

02:29.807 --> 02:32.475
we all know Irving is
coming in here, so...

02:32.569 --> 02:34.895
I think what we need
to focus on is

02:34.988 --> 02:36.646
the selection of the caissons.

02:36.731 --> 02:38.648
That's right.
I think the consensus

02:38.741 --> 02:40.325
- would be D-2 first.
- Yeah.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.411
Yep. I agree.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.413
Yeah. Well, makes sense.

02:44.572 --> 02:45.989
MATT:
The depth of this one might be

02:46.082 --> 02:48.575
- a better chance for getting some silver, right?
- Okay.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.327
NARRATOR:
<i>Three months ago,</i>

02:50.420 --> 02:52.495
<i>the team conducted
extensive water testing</i>

02:52.580 --> 02:54.497
<i>in numerous boreholes...</i>

02:54.582 --> 02:56.758
<i>and obtained heightened evidence</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:58.418
<i>-of a vast cache</i>
-(rapid beeping)

02:58.502 --> 03:00.086
<i>Of both silver and gold.</i>

03:00.180 --> 03:02.339
- CHARLES: That's a big chunk of metal right there.
- TERRY: Wow.

03:02.423 --> 03:04.841
<i>NARRATOR: Since those
stunning scientific discoveries...</i>

03:04.934 --> 03:07.603
<i>the team has conducted
a strategic</i>

03:07.687 --> 03:09.938
<i>core-drilling operation
across a grid</i>

03:10.097 --> 03:12.191
<i>of some 20 new boreholes,</i>

03:12.275 --> 03:15.352
<i>searching for more tangible
evidence of treasure.</i>

03:15.436 --> 03:18.271
- STEVE G.: That's a lot of wood.
- CHARLES: Yeah.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.449
<i>NARRATOR: Among the
most promising locations</i>

03:20.608 --> 03:22.701
<i>was D-2, where they unearthed</i>

03:22.785 --> 03:25.111
<i>not only evidence
of wooden structures...</i>

03:25.205 --> 03:27.122
<i>but also a fragment of metal</i>

03:27.207 --> 03:30.876
<i>some 90 feet deep
containing high levels of gold.</i>

03:31.619 --> 03:33.703
The sonic drill program has

03:33.796 --> 03:36.298
indicated that there are
substantial works

03:36.382 --> 03:39.376
in that area, uh, i.e.,
a tunnel, perhaps

03:39.460 --> 03:40.969
- a shaft.
- Yeah.

03:41.128 --> 03:43.388
<i>Over the course of this week...</i>

03:43.547 --> 03:45.974
<i>representatives from
Irving Equipment Limited</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:48.802
<i>and ROC Equipment
will be transporting</i>

03:48.886 --> 03:50.646
<i>massive amounts
of heavy machinery,</i>

03:50.805 --> 03:53.649
<i>including a 220-ton crane,</i>

03:53.733 --> 03:56.393
<i>sections
of ten-foot-wide steel casing,</i>

03:56.477 --> 03:58.812
<i>and a 22-and-a-half-ton
hammer grab</i>

03:58.896 --> 04:01.147
<i>in order to excavate D-2</i>

04:01.232 --> 04:04.818
<i>and hopefully solve
the Oak Island mystery.</i>

04:04.911 --> 04:08.321
The speed and the pace of the
work up there is gonna increase,

04:08.414 --> 04:09.998
simply because of the volumes

04:10.083 --> 04:12.409
- that we're dealing with, right?
- That's right.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.744
Last year, the five-foot can,

04:14.829 --> 04:18.248
we were maybe extracting
a yard of material.

04:18.332 --> 04:21.593
Now we're gonna be pulling out
almost five yards of material.

04:21.752 --> 04:23.920
Gary, you know
what your responsibilities are.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.172
- Metal detect the entire thing.
- Yeah.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.174
- No small job.
- MARTY: No.

04:28.259 --> 04:30.593
I do have a concern that,

04:30.687 --> 04:32.429
that we need
to keep focus on the,

04:32.513 --> 04:34.514
the zones of best interest.

04:34.598 --> 04:37.100
If we could isolate,
like in D-2,

04:37.193 --> 04:40.437
from 70
to a little over 100 feet,

04:40.530 --> 04:42.030
I think
that would be very important.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.699
Exactly.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.367
JACK:
I'm going off of what Craig

04:45.451 --> 04:47.536
just said, and we're doing two

04:47.620 --> 04:50.789
times as much...
washing this year.

04:50.948 --> 04:52.624
I'm wondering if everything's
gonna be able

04:52.783 --> 04:54.376
- to go through the plant?
- RICK: It's all unknowns

04:54.460 --> 04:56.202
- till we get into it.
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.454
If we get behind,

04:57.547 --> 04:59.798
- then we will adapt.
- Yeah.

04:59.957 --> 05:02.718
<i>NARRATOR: As the team
excavates borehole D-2,</i>

05:02.877 --> 05:05.378
<i>the tons of earth-- or spoils--</i>

05:05.463 --> 05:07.973
<i>Will be transported to
an industrial-grade wash plant</i>

05:08.132 --> 05:09.975
<i>near Smith's Cove.</i>

05:10.134 --> 05:12.561
<i>There they will be carefully
cleaned, sifted,</i>

05:12.720 --> 05:14.721
<i>and sorted according to size,</i>

05:14.814 --> 05:18.150
<i>then searched
for any possible valuables.</i>

05:18.309 --> 05:21.561
Because of the scale
of the work,

05:21.645 --> 05:23.813
the most important issue is,
as it always is,

05:23.898 --> 05:26.074
- is safety, and...
- Yeah.

05:26.233 --> 05:28.744
There is one overriding concern
and that

05:28.828 --> 05:30.487
- is the Money Pit pad.
- Right.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.581
Billy's going to be
entirely responsible

05:32.665 --> 05:34.499
for the Money Pit pad
and all the preparations

05:34.658 --> 05:36.159
that need to be done

05:36.252 --> 05:38.661
- before Irving moves in.
- Yeah.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.748
<i>NARRATOR: Due to more than
two centuries of digging and drilling</i>

05:41.832 --> 05:44.417
<i>by generations
of previous searchers,</i>

05:44.510 --> 05:47.504
<i>the ground in the Money Pit
area remains unstable</i>

05:47.597 --> 05:50.673
<i>with the potential
for dangerous cave-ins.</i>

05:50.758 --> 05:53.927
<i>Therefore, before the dig
can begin,</i>

05:54.020 --> 05:55.845
<i>Billy Gerhardt, and his team</i>

05:55.938 --> 05:58.106
<i>from Gerhardt Property
Improvement,</i>

05:58.191 --> 06:02.685
<i>will haul in more
than 1,150 tons of fresh gravel</i>

06:02.770 --> 06:06.689
<i>to not only ensure that the two
and half acre area is level,</i>

06:06.774 --> 06:09.275
<i>but also stable in order to
support</i>

06:09.369 --> 06:12.287
<i>all of the heavy machinery
that is currently on its way</i>

06:12.446 --> 06:15.281
<i>to the island.</i>

06:15.366 --> 06:17.542
BILLY: We have quite a bit
of work to do to make sure

06:17.627 --> 06:20.036
- that the Money Pit is stable.
- Right.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.705
But our success
now depends on everybody.

06:22.790 --> 06:25.217
- Yep. - Whatever needs to get done.
- That's right.

06:25.376 --> 06:27.043
- Yeah.
- GARY: And what I want to know is,

06:27.136 --> 06:28.720
where are we gonna store
all the treasure?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.390
(laughter)

06:32.800 --> 06:35.552
MARTY: Okay... I think
that wraps this one up.

06:35.636 --> 06:37.387
Let's all get
back out there and finish

06:37.480 --> 06:39.481
whatever preparations
need to be done.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.058
- Yep.
- This could be the year that we do find the treasure.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.902
<i>MARTY:
Gold is what I'm hoping we find.</i>

06:43.986 --> 06:45.487
<i>RICK:
That'd be fantastic.</i>

06:48.566 --> 06:50.659
<i>NARRATOR:
Later that morning...</i>

06:53.237 --> 06:55.405
Got a little job to do here.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.666
Gonna be quite
a little job here, yep.

07:01.745 --> 07:03.588
<i>the preparation
of the Money Pit area...</i>

07:03.747 --> 07:05.915
BILLY: The Money Pit has
to be strong enough to hold

07:06.008 --> 07:08.251
a bigger can, bigger oscillator,
bigger crane, bigger weight, right?

07:08.335 --> 07:10.336
Yep.

07:10.421 --> 07:12.347
TERRY:
FTS-2 is underway.

07:12.506 --> 07:15.425
FTS stands
for "Flood Tunnel Search."

<i>Money Pit excavation.</i>

07:32.535 --> 07:35.454
TERRY: We've got quite a
ways to go. We're only at 38 feet.

07:35.613 --> 07:38.031
But this is the point
at which we...

07:38.124 --> 07:40.125
lost contact with solid ground

07:40.209 --> 07:43.545
and dropped into a relative void
in the previous hole.

07:45.039 --> 07:46.465
CRAIG:
Here's another one right here.

07:46.624 --> 07:48.875
<i>NARRATOR: Two weeks ago,

<i>known as A-13...</i>

07:54.223 --> 07:56.132
<i>the team made
a curious discovery.</i>

07:56.225 --> 07:57.726
TERRY:
It almost looks like grass,

07:57.810 --> 07:59.886
Maybe eelgrass
or something washing in.

<i>NARRATOR:
Eelgrass,</i>

08:01.564 --> 08:03.890
<i>along with vast amounts
of coconut fiber,</i>

<i>were discovered

<i>NARRATOR:
Now more than 170 years later,</i>

08:23.252 --> 08:25.837
<i>after finding
their own evidence of eelgrass,</i>

08:25.996 --> 08:29.582
<i>the Oak Island team is

<i>the flood tunnel
might be found at a depth</i>

08:33.513 --> 08:36.264
<i>of nearly 120 feet.</i>

08:36.423 --> 08:37.766
Another sample is coming
up shortly here.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.434
- Seems pretty solid, eh?
- Yeah.

08:39.593 --> 08:40.760
<i>NARRATOR:
It is their hope,</i>

08:40.844 --> 08:42.103
<i>that if they can penetrate</i>

08:42.263 --> 08:44.430
<i>and compromise the tunnel,</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:46.942
<i>it will cut off the flow
of seawater into the Money Pit</i>

08:47.101 --> 08:49.686
<i>and allow them to succeed</i>

08:49.770 --> 08:51.863
<i>where so many before
have failed,</i>

08:52.022 --> 08:54.357
<i>giving them the ability

08:54.450 --> 08:56.368
<i>the original treasure shaft.</i>

08:56.527 --> 08:58.027
<i>MARTY:
Because we're drilling</i>

08:58.112 --> 08:59.704
<i>rather near the Money Pit,</i>

08:59.863 --> 09:02.031
<i>but between the Money Pit
and Smith's Cove,</i>

09:02.116 --> 09:04.450
if we were to encounter
a flood tunnel,

09:04.544 --> 09:08.538
it would probably be near the
point it entered the Money Pit.

09:08.622 --> 09:11.457
<i>So it looks to me
like this could be significant</i>

09:11.542 --> 09:13.793
<i>to help with our quest.</i>

09:13.886 --> 09:15.720
And where are we at, 48?

09:15.805 --> 09:16.888
BRENNAN:
48 at the bottom of this.

relatively soft-ish and getting

09:21.218 --> 09:23.469
into soft blue-gray till.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.897
That means we might be

09:26.056 --> 09:27.857
close to something.

09:29.810 --> 09:33.229
If you're close to a structure,
ofttimes

09:33.322 --> 09:35.407
- we find that it gets quite soft, as you well know.
- BRENNAN: Yeah, yeah.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.826
I think we can be quite hopeful
we're gonna encounter

09:37.910 --> 09:39.244
the structure.

09:41.238 --> 09:43.656
Time's gonna tell, I guess.

09:47.161 --> 09:49.412

This shovel's hungry.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.256
It's hungry
for top-pocket finds.

09:51.415 --> 09:53.750
- Let's feed the beast.
- Let's do it.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.520
I like to call it,
"The Giving Lot."

10:05.605 --> 10:08.940
Every time we come back here, we
find some coins and artifacts.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.434
- All right, mate, let's see what we got.
- I'm ready to go.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.936
<i>NARRATOR:

10:14.030 --> 10:16.606

10:16.699 --> 10:18.941
<i>of incredible discoveries

10:19.035 --> 10:21.944
<i>including a lead cargo bag seal</i>

10:22.029 --> 10:23.863
<i>that the team believes

<i>ox shoes and also...</i>

10:28.377 --> 10:31.871
<i>potential evidence
of an ancient ship's wharf.</i>

10:31.964 --> 10:34.549
Okay, mate, first flag's here.

10:34.708 --> 10:37.377
- It's a little bit rocky.
- Yeah.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.429
- Let's see what this one is.
- (metal detector beeping)

10:41.557 --> 10:43.475
I'm getting mixed signals.

10:43.634 --> 10:45.301
But...

10:45.394 --> 10:48.146
definitely enough signal there
to dig.

10:48.305 --> 10:50.398
- RICK: Seems a bit jumpy.
- Yeah, it does.

10:58.565 --> 11:00.149
RICK:
Still in the hole.

11:00.234 --> 11:02.077
Let's see if I can pinpoint it.

11:02.653 --> 11:06.072
There it is!
Oh, we know what that is.

11:06.156 --> 11:08.074
- Your old friend.
- Yep.

11:08.158 --> 11:11.586
That is a broken ox shoe.

11:11.745 --> 11:14.831
It's a fantastic find for this
area.

11:14.915 --> 11:17.917
You'd assume that you
would find ox shoes in an area

11:18.001 --> 11:21.096
where you think there's a wharf,
there's been some unloading.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.172
Maybe it broke
because it was a heavy load.

11:23.257 --> 11:25.600
Yeah, it seems thicker.

11:25.759 --> 11:27.769
And it's heavy for its size.

11:27.928 --> 11:30.596
- There's a lot of work in here to get you in, Gar.
- Yeah, there is.

11:30.681 --> 11:33.274
So the next flag's
just over here, mate.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.694
Let's see what this
one sounds like.

11:35.853 --> 11:37.946
(beeping)

11:38.030 --> 11:39.522
Yeah, better.

11:39.606 --> 11:41.199
Just there, mate.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.001
Yeah, I'd rather take my time
breaking stuff apart.

11:53.454 --> 11:56.297
Whatever it is, it's out.

11:56.457 --> 11:58.550

an important discovery.</i>

12:13.390 --> 12:15.150
Ooh, a little copper piece.

12:15.309 --> 12:18.570
- Copper or brass.
- Yeah.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.563
Ooh, it's got a little--
Am I seeing things

12:20.656 --> 12:22.565
or is there a design on there?

12:22.649 --> 12:24.817
I see what you're saying, yeah.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.653
To me, when I look at it,
it looks like "S" and "A."

12:27.738 --> 12:30.990
GARY:
Yeah. Kind of looks...

12:31.083 --> 12:32.917
scripted, doesn't it?

12:33.002 --> 12:35.244
<i>NARRATOR:
A copper artifact?</i>

12:35.329 --> 12:37.922
<i>Possibly bearing
part of an inscription?</i>

12:38.007 --> 12:40.508
<i>Could it be
a fragment of a container</i>

12:40.593 --> 12:43.928
<i>or perhaps an adornment
to an article of clothing?</i>

12:44.013 --> 12:46.264
<i>And, if so,
might it help identify</i>

12:46.348 --> 12:48.257
<i>its original owner?</i>

12:48.342 --> 12:50.018
GARY:
I like this, mate.

12:50.177 --> 12:52.011
Because if there is any

12:52.095 --> 12:54.272
cursive writing or any old-style

12:54.356 --> 12:58.026
numbers, um,
it would make it older

12:58.185 --> 13:00.853
and probably date it to

13:00.938 --> 13:02.614
- the other artifacts in this area.
- Yep.

13:02.773 --> 13:04.949
<i>GARY:
You can see by the look of it</i>

13:05.108 --> 13:07.619
that it's connected
to all the other finds

13:07.703 --> 13:10.622
that we've recovered
in the same area.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.865
Maybe there is a design
on there.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.127
Because I do, I see
some kind of scripting on it.

13:16.286 --> 13:18.713
<i>There could be
some kind of initials</i>

and hopefully glean

13:24.211 --> 13:27.213
some information
from this artifact.

Okay, mate, on to the next.

something there, mate.

Nice, old coin.

to be
a very interesting location.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.658
Fantastic.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.721

21:48.548 --> 21:51.058
GARY:
That's definitely interesting.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.469
That was out of the last bucket?

21:53.562 --> 21:55.646
- Yes.
- It looks like it's broken,

21:55.805 --> 21:58.649
but this piece looks like
it's shaped around there,

21:58.808 --> 22:00.401
on purpose.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.810
- DAVID F.: It's interesting.
- PETER: Yeah.

22:01.895 --> 22:03.571
Yeah. Very interesting.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.323
It'll be interesting to see
if we get this tested,

22:05.482 --> 22:08.659
if it-it is the same date,
or a similar date,

22:08.818 --> 22:10.911
- to the ship's piece that we found last year.
- Yeah.

22:11.071 --> 22:12.413
Like my Uncle Rick always says,

22:12.572 --> 22:15.157
and-and like Laird always says,
I mean, it's about context.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.493
Yeah, and that's
a good point because they seem

22:17.577 --> 22:19.912
to be one-offs,
but we're finding more and more

22:20.005 --> 22:22.423
irregular pieces of wood

22:22.507 --> 22:25.334
that have been
manipulated by man.

22:25.418 --> 22:26.927
DAVID F.: If we can
start linking them together,

22:27.012 --> 22:28.420
that's where we can really start

22:28.513 --> 22:30.348
to understand the story.

22:30.507 --> 22:33.017
Yeah. We're finding
more and more planking,

22:33.176 --> 22:35.186
decking, or siding,

22:35.270 --> 22:38.180
and shaped pieces of wood.

22:38.264 --> 22:40.599
And I'm getting on board.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.152
I really do think
there's a ship in the swamp.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.772
Very, very cool piece of wood.

22:46.856 --> 22:48.282
Good eye, Michael.
We'll put it to one side,

22:48.441 --> 22:50.451
and one more for the pile.

22:50.610 --> 22:52.694
- We'll find some more.
- PETER: Yeah!

into a tunnel, how about that?

- ADAM: 88!
- 88.

23:21.724 --> 23:23.809
Oh!

23:23.902 --> 23:25.403
We got some soft stuff, yeah.

23:25.562 --> 23:27.988
Water's been at it.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.232
Softening up like crazy, yeah.

23:30.316 --> 23:32.818
Wow.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.153
Very soft. Look at that.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.654
We've got to be close

23:35.738 --> 23:37.331
to some kind
of an open structure

23:37.490 --> 23:38.824
- with water in it.
- Yeah.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.576
TERRY:
But no wood.

23:40.660 --> 23:43.412
So we're not hitting that

23:43.505 --> 23:46.257
same structure
we hit in the Money Pit.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.341
BRENNAN: So we
technically should've hit it on...?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.084
We should've. I would've thought

23:49.177 --> 23:50.419
- we would've hit it, yes.
- ALEX: If not this one,

23:50.512 --> 23:52.430
- then the next one.
- TERRY: Yeah.

23:52.514 --> 23:55.099
- If not then, then we're just gonna cut it off.
- Okay.

23:56.768 --> 24:00.345
We have an indication possibly

24:00.430 --> 24:03.432
<i>that we're really close
to a man-made tunnel</i>

24:03.516 --> 24:05.601
<i>that filled with water.</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:07.102
And for us, that could be great,

24:07.195 --> 24:08.687
because it could be
the flood tunnel.

24:08.771 --> 24:11.190
107!

24:11.283 --> 24:13.108
<i>ALEX: If we could hit
this structure down there,</i>

24:13.201 --> 24:14.535

that we could block</i>

24:14.694 --> 24:16.370
<i>all the flooding and everything.</i>

we've got something, boys.

There it is. Oh, smell that.

kind of weird? I mean,

25:29.018 --> 25:31.103

- Oh, it's night and day.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.863
TERRY:
Interesting.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.115
So below this maroon till,

25:35.200 --> 25:37.526
we get into, somebody...

25:37.610 --> 25:39.703
dug a little structure
in place there for us.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.956
BRENNAN:
Yeah, it's cut on the bottom.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.283
- ALEX: Yeah.
- TERRY: So it is.

25:44.367 --> 25:47.202
That almost looks
like it was hit with an adze,

25:47.287 --> 25:49.371
which would say "quite old."

25:49.455 --> 25:50.381
BRENNAN:
Yep.

of British origin,</i>

<i>but also dated back
to the late 17th century.</i>

<i>that the adze was used
to construct?</i>

26:20.579 --> 26:22.913
Is this the top of the tunnel?

26:22.998 --> 26:25.499
Well, I'm thinking
this is probably the top

26:25.658 --> 26:27.501
and this is the bottom.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.661
It's hard to say.

26:29.746 --> 26:32.080
Yeah, I'd buy that.
Yeah, they're not falling apart.

26:32.165 --> 26:34.750
- Yep, and they're separated, clean.
- Yep.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.260
BRENNAN:
I wonder if that was dry.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.586
I wonder
if there's water in the hole.

26:37.670 --> 26:40.172
Well, this is what we're hoping.
You could imagine

26:40.265 --> 26:42.182
maybe they were a little bit
akimbo to one another

26:42.267 --> 26:45.594
and you might have some area
for water to move through.

26:45.678 --> 26:47.605
ALEX: I think it was, I think
it was like this down there.

26:47.764 --> 26:49.523
I think the water is
just in here.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.941
- I think it was open.
- TERRY: Yes.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.518
Well, I think we should
call Rick, see what he thinks.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.446
TERRY: Absolutely.
He'd be interested in that.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.523
Uncle Rick. Hey, we're up here

26:58.617 --> 27:01.869
on the drill table and...
we have hit the wood.

27:01.953 --> 27:05.205
<i>In this area, there's the legend
of the flood tunnel and...</i>

27:05.290 --> 27:07.115
it's possible
part of it had beams

27:07.208 --> 27:09.293
and it's possible
it's collapsed.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.795
<i>So we really need to get
the carbon date from this wood</i>

27:11.954 --> 27:13.705
<i>and learn what we can
from this hole.</i>

27:13.790 --> 27:16.041
- Hey, guys.
- MARTY: Hey, fellas.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.968

- TERRY: Feast your eyes, gentlemen.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.220
<i>ALEX:
Hopefully from today's data</i>

27:20.380 --> 27:22.222
<i>we'll be able to project</i>

27:22.307 --> 27:24.391
a direction for what
we think is a tunnel.

TERRY:
Hello, Rick!

27:26.469 --> 27:27.895
- Hey, guys.
- RICK: Good morning. - Hey.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.730
- What's up?
- How you doing? Hey, Dan.

27:29.889 --> 27:31.056
- Right there. - STEVE G.: Hey, Dan.
- Well, we got a...

27:31.149 --> 27:33.725
Feast your eyes.

27:33.810 --> 27:35.727
A miracle happens on Oak Island
every now and then.

27:35.812 --> 27:38.146
There it is.

27:38.231 --> 27:41.066
Well, it came out like this.

27:41.150 --> 27:43.819
Kind of two separate chunks.

27:43.903 --> 27:46.488
And this was at the end
of the run, about 106 feet.

27:46.581 --> 27:49.667
RICK: What are the
implications of this?

27:49.826 --> 27:51.669
TERRY: I'm really quite certain
that we've come down

27:51.828 --> 27:54.171
through just saturated
and loose material

27:54.255 --> 27:56.006
into wood at the bottom.

27:56.165 --> 27:57.841
And the only thing usually
that will give us that

27:58.000 --> 28:00.001
is a tunnel
and we've intersected that.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.171
I would bet we had a lot
of water movement

28:03.264 --> 28:04.598
in and around that open space

28:04.757 --> 28:06.016
between those two blocks
of wood.

28:06.175 --> 28:07.476
Great.

28:08.845 --> 28:11.346
(chuckles) It doesn't get
any better than that.

28:11.439 --> 28:14.182
Dan, you have more years here

28:14.267 --> 28:15.943
- than all of us combined.
- Yeah.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.103
What do you make of that find?

28:18.187 --> 28:21.699
Well, allowing for the elevation

28:21.858 --> 28:24.693
where they tunneled
probably from Smith's Cove.

28:24.777 --> 28:27.121
That could be very close
to the original

28:27.205 --> 28:29.206
flooding tunnel
that they discovered.

28:31.033 --> 28:33.201
Well, if carbon dating
should come up with that

28:33.286 --> 28:34.628
very tight window of 1600s,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.296
then I'd say that that's

28:36.381 --> 28:38.048
definitively the original works.

28:38.207 --> 28:39.383
Yep.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.969
RICK: That's what
that says to me because

28:42.128 --> 28:45.139
there's only so much information
you can glean from what's

28:45.223 --> 28:47.141
been done in the past, right?

28:47.300 --> 28:49.810
We have to think about how
this affects us moving forward.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.812
<i>NARRATOR:
If the team is correct</i>

28:51.971 --> 28:53.638
<i>that they have, in fact,</i>

28:53.723 --> 28:55.807
<i>drilled through
the legendary flood tunnel,</i>

28:55.892 --> 28:58.977
<i>and perhaps compromised its
integrity and function,</i>

28:59.061 --> 29:01.563
<i>it will hopefully mean
that they have removed</i>

29:01.647 --> 29:04.399
<i>one major obstacle that
has thwarted the efforts</i>

29:04.484 --> 29:06.985
<i>of everyone who came before them
in the quest</i>

29:07.069 --> 29:09.988
<i>to recover a potentially
priceless treasure.</i>

29:10.081 --> 29:12.583
<i>RICK: It was inferred
that this might be</i>

29:12.742 --> 29:15.335
a very small tunnel
in terms of height.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.921
<i>That's interesting
because of the old description</i>

29:18.006 --> 29:20.916
<i>of the so-called flood tunnel,
was two foot by three foot,</i>

29:21.000 --> 29:23.168
<i>and this certainly is
no bigger than that.</i>

29:23.252 --> 29:25.763
That's important
because it may have some impact

29:25.922 --> 29:28.590
in terms of our caisson
placement for the year.

29:28.674 --> 29:30.926
Yeah, if it's depositor, great.

29:31.010 --> 29:32.677
- That's right.
- ALEX: At the end of the day,

29:32.771 --> 29:35.096
- it just tells us where else to go.
- STEVE G.: That's right.

29:35.181 --> 29:37.182
It would be fantastic
if we can chase it

29:37.266 --> 29:38.275
to the Money Pit and it gives us

29:38.359 --> 29:39.601
a direct line
to where we need to be.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.195
Everything is good information

29:41.279 --> 29:43.188
- for us.
- RICK: Oh, absolutely.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.531
Here's hoping.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.866
All right, thanks, everybody.

I'm gonna turn it over to Billy
to describe where it came from.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.408
- So go ahead, Billy.
- That was, uh...

30:36.492 --> 30:38.743
(clears throat)
pretty close to the ship's rail.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.088
I'd say...

30:41.247 --> 30:44.249
probably 30 feet, you know, from
it, it was in that general area.

30:44.333 --> 30:47.010
And our immediate reaction was,
hey, it looked like, weren't

30:47.095 --> 30:48.595
sure, looked like the tip
of an oar, maybe, but...

30:48.754 --> 30:51.423
Are you certain that's...

30:51.507 --> 30:53.258
shaped?

30:53.351 --> 30:55.185
- It's a really thin piece of wood, so...
- Mm-hmm.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.937
And it just looks
like the ends were tapered.

30:57.021 --> 31:00.107
Craig has C-14 results on it.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.434
This one's interesting.
I mean, it...

31:02.518 --> 31:05.028

to have a fairly uniform

31:05.113 --> 31:07.614

- That doesn't match anything else that we have.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.403
- No.
- JACK: All right, but here's the question though.

31:46.562 --> 31:49.072
How is this wood
related to the treasure?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.407
ALEX:
I don't know. I don't know,

31:50.566 --> 31:52.242
- the date is so early.
- MARTY: Yeah, I know. You've got

31:52.327 --> 31:53.994
to come up
with a convoluted answer because

31:54.078 --> 31:55.820
- of the date's so weird.
- Yeah.

31:55.905 --> 31:58.248

31:58.333 --> 32:00.751
<i>discovered in 1795,</i>

32:00.835 --> 32:03.670
<i>one of the most common
theories among searchers</i>

32:03.755 --> 32:06.665
<i>was that whatever may lie
buried in the treasure shaft</i>

32:06.749 --> 32:09.176

32:09.335 --> 32:11.845
<i>or 18th century pirates</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:14.348

32:38.948 --> 32:42.033
<i>NARRATOR: Until now,
the most perplexing discovery</i>

32:42.126 --> 32:45.045
<i>was a piece of ship's railing

32:45.129 --> 32:48.289
<i>near the southern border
of the swamp one year ago</i>

32:48.374 --> 32:51.376
<i>that was
dated to as early as 660 AD.</i>

32:51.460 --> 32:54.546
<i>Could this believed fragment
of ship planking</i>

32:54.639 --> 32:57.382
<i>mean that the origins
of this mystery go back</i>

32:57.466 --> 33:00.802
<i>even further
than anyone ever imagined?</i>

33:00.886 --> 33:03.638
- CRAIG: Everybody thought that was man worked.
- Yeah...

33:03.723 --> 33:05.649
We don't know what part
of the tree this came from.

33:05.733 --> 33:07.892
So if it was
the inner part of a tree,

33:07.977 --> 33:09.561
then it could put in the ship's

33:09.645 --> 33:11.062
time period,
which is around 600.

33:11.147 --> 33:13.323
So both of them are super early.

33:13.482 --> 33:15.409

33:15.568 --> 33:16.994
show me some data."

33:17.153 --> 33:18.570
Because otherwise
I'm not gonna believe it.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.831

still don't believe it.

Yeah, a 95.4%.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.998
MARTY:
Whew.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.916
I don't know what
to do with that.

33:42.854 --> 33:46.189
<i>And that's one of
the real curses of Oak Island</i>

33:46.274 --> 33:49.517
<i>is that you can't rule out
almost anything.</i>

33:49.602 --> 33:51.686
Craig, don't you dare, ever,

33:51.779 --> 33:54.031
bring another time period
in here.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.866
(laughter)

33:55.950 --> 33:57.776
- We've got plenty.
- STEVE G.: Just because the date

33:57.860 --> 33:59.944
doesn't fit doesn't mean it
wasn't used at a later date.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.289
No, wood, wood kept dry
does last basically forever.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.041
So that doesn't mean
it couldn't be

34:04.125 --> 34:06.126
related to something else
we've found-- let's use

34:06.210 --> 34:08.286
the ship's railing. What are
they, 300 to 400 years apart?

34:08.370 --> 34:10.789
They could be related. They're
just from different trees.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.540
There's certain species
that can last forever.

34:12.633 --> 34:15.552
- Yeah.
- DAN H.: The basic rule is

34:15.636 --> 34:18.630
do some more analysis,
wider range

34:18.723 --> 34:22.225
of investigations, and see
if you, uh, first of all,

34:22.310 --> 34:24.811
can identify the wood--
What plant, what continent

34:24.896 --> 34:27.314
it came from.
Maybe a region, you know.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.899
This is just step one.

34:28.983 --> 34:31.651
My thought would be
a species I.D.

34:31.736 --> 34:32.819
Right.

<i>which they intend to do
at the University of Alaska.</i>

34:58.587 --> 35:01.765
All of this work comes about
because we are

35:01.924 --> 35:05.769
on a quest, if you will,
to find answers

35:05.853 --> 35:09.523
to a-a very
one-of-a-kind mystery.

35:09.682 --> 35:14.269
And, uh, that is, you know, what
happened here on Oak Island.

35:14.353 --> 35:16.938
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

35:17.022 --> 35:20.108
<i>these dates indicated
a period of time that is</i>

35:20.192 --> 35:22.786
<i>decidedly
and distinctly different.</i>

35:22.870 --> 35:25.872
<i>The next step is to see if
it's out of place on the island.</i>

35:26.031 --> 35:27.707
Is it native to the area?

35:27.792 --> 35:30.034
If it's not,
then how did it get here?

35:30.128 --> 35:32.287
We can find the species,

35:32.380 --> 35:34.214
and at least where it came from.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.790
If it was from Europe or not.

35:35.883 --> 35:37.125
That would make
a big difference.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.969
STEVE G.:
We test the species

35:39.053 --> 35:40.804
and we see if it's a wood
that can last a long time,

35:40.963 --> 35:43.473
especially a wood...
typically used on a ship,

35:43.632 --> 35:45.725
and that's really
the first step from here.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.802
- RICK: Mm-hmm.
- Well, look-look, gentlemen,

35:47.887 --> 35:49.062

I mean,

35:50.639 --> 35:52.891
let's redo
the carbon-14 test and

35:52.984 --> 35:55.652
- we can decide what, what next to do.
- RICK: Yep.

35:55.811 --> 35:57.478

any more mysteries.

37:31.824 --> 37:33.583
I don't know.
None of us know that.

37:33.742 --> 37:36.160
Will proof come up?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.913
That's all that matters to me.
It's a very simple goal.

37:38.998 --> 37:41.416
Find one piece of irrefutable
evidence underground,

37:41.509 --> 37:44.094
- deep underground.
- With all the data,

37:44.253 --> 37:47.180
-all the results from
all the testing, -Yeah.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.099
- This is the year!
- MARTY: Let's go!

37:50.601 --> 37:52.010
- Yeah.
- (laughter)

37:52.103 --> 37:54.271
- CHARLES: Here they come.
- All right, here they come.

37:54.430 --> 37:56.189
Here we go.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.099
GARY:
Wow!

37:58.192 --> 38:01.019
- Look at the size of that can.
- (Marty whoops)

38:01.112 --> 38:03.613
<i>RICK: When the caissons
come across the causeway,</i>

38:03.772 --> 38:04.864
<i>you know, there's some
excitement in the air.</i>

38:05.024 --> 38:06.700
<i>It's palpable, certainly.
I mean...</i>

38:06.784 --> 38:08.535
<i>it's not just the caissons,
of course.</i>

38:08.694 --> 38:10.370
<i>It's always about the people.</i>

38:10.454 --> 38:12.205
So it's great

38:12.364 --> 38:14.449
to welcome back old friends.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.543
- MARTY: Hey, Vanessa!
- Hey, hey!

38:16.702 --> 38:18.628
<i>NARRATOR:
Arriving back</i>

38:18.713 --> 38:21.956
<i>on the island to once again
supervise the dig</i>

38:22.041 --> 38:24.709
<i>are ROC Equipment's owner
Vanessa Lucido</i>

38:24.802 --> 38:26.461
<i>and her heavy equipment
operators Danny Smith</i>

38:26.545 --> 38:28.463
<i>and Jared Busby.</i>

38:28.547 --> 38:30.557
<i>They are joined
by Michel Ouellette</i>

38:30.641 --> 38:34.811
<i>and Andrew Beaulieu representing
Irving Equipment Limited.</i>

38:34.895 --> 38:37.555
VANESSA: Y'all see
this coming in right now?

38:37.639 --> 38:39.057
Are you ready for this?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.483
We're ready for this.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.227
VANESSA:
This isn't small cans.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.480
- No. Wow.
- VANESSA: Yeah.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.899
We're gonna find it
this year, right?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.233
This year is the year.

38:49.318 --> 38:50.485
VANESSA:
I'm excited!

38:50.569 --> 38:52.403
We're ready.
(laughs)

38:52.496 --> 38:53.571
MARTY: No, this is gonna
be fun, it's gonna be exciting.

38:53.664 --> 38:54.914
Uh, it's gonna be a lot of work.

38:55.074 --> 38:57.658
You've seen the spoils come out
from the littler ones.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.744
Yeah, it'll be quite a bit more.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.254
VANESSA: We know we can't do
this without disturbing the ground,

39:01.339 --> 39:04.341
but the grab operation is
gonna be the less destructive.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.084
Because you're gonna be
encapsulating things

39:06.168 --> 39:08.086
- rather than breaking them, right?
- Yeah.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.180
So we're gonna get
like five cubic yards

39:10.264 --> 39:13.007
with this grab, so a lot bigger.

39:13.100 --> 39:16.936
<i>NARRATOR: Once all of the
equipment is in place over Borehole D-2</i>

39:17.021 --> 39:19.689
<i>and the dig begins
in the coming days,</i>

39:19.848 --> 39:22.600
<i>the ten-foot-diameter caissons
will allow</i>

39:22.684 --> 39:25.362
<i>the 22-and-a-half-ton
hammer grab to remove</i>

39:25.521 --> 39:28.689
<i>as much as 11,000 pounds
of earth per scoop.</i>

39:28.774 --> 39:32.035
<i>That means that if Borehole D-2</i>

39:32.194 --> 39:34.788
<i>is on target
above the fabled Chappell Vault,</i>

39:34.872 --> 39:37.874
<i>buried more
than 150 feet underground,</i>

39:38.033 --> 39:41.544
<i>the team could potentially
recover it whole.</i>

39:41.629 --> 39:44.464
<i>MARTY: We're gonna have
a lot of investigative volume</i>

39:44.623 --> 39:46.624
<i>in the Money Pit.
Pretty exciting.</i>

39:46.717 --> 39:48.718
And here's what's very clear.

39:48.877 --> 39:51.712
It's time to change our focus
from the information hunt

39:51.806 --> 39:54.215
all over the island
to digging up

39:54.308 --> 39:56.634
and beginning the treasure hunt,

39:56.718 --> 39:58.645
the actual treasure hunt
up at the Money Pit.

39:58.729 --> 40:02.565
Do you know why we're
so driven this year?

40:02.724 --> 40:05.568
- I have no, no clue.
- MARTY: Yeah, I'll tell her.

40:05.727 --> 40:08.396
There is definitely,
for sure, completely,

40:08.489 --> 40:10.657
- without a doubt...
- Based on science.

40:10.741 --> 40:13.827
based on science,
with no possibility of error,

40:13.911 --> 40:15.319
gold down there.

40:15.404 --> 40:17.155
- There is!
- (laughing): That's cool!

40:17.248 --> 40:19.490
(laughter)

40:19.575 --> 40:22.076
- Well, I'm glad you went big.
- RICK: So are we.

40:22.161 --> 40:25.004
- We really couldn't do it without you, so...
- That's for sure.

40:25.164 --> 40:27.248
Well, team's here. We're ready.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.167
MARTY:
Okay. I think we've done enough

40:29.251 --> 40:31.085
talking-- why don't
we get this stuff unloaded?

40:31.178 --> 40:32.587
- Let's do it.
- MARTY: All right.

40:32.671 --> 40:35.265
- Very good.
- Come on, we'll meet down there.

40:35.424 --> 40:37.517
<i>NARRATOR: The months
of waiting are now over.</i>

40:37.676 --> 40:40.678
<i>The dig is about to begin.</i>

40:40.771 --> 40:44.098
<i>And for brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina and their team,</i>

40:44.183 --> 40:47.185
<i>the dream they have shared,
to solve</i>

40:47.269 --> 40:49.353
<i>a 227-year-old mystery,</i>

40:49.438 --> 40:52.115
<i>may soon be fulfilled.</i>

40:52.199 --> 40:54.951
<i>But as they reach
into the underground depths</i>

40:55.110 --> 40:57.203
<i>that have left so many
before them vanquished,</i>

40:57.362 --> 40:59.530
<i>what will they ultimately find?</i>

40:59.615 --> 41:02.533
<i>Spanish silver and gold?</i>

41:02.626 --> 41:05.870
<i>Priceless treasures connected
to the Knights Templar?</i>

41:05.954 --> 41:09.207
<i>Perhaps it will
include them all...</i>

41:09.300 --> 41:11.926
<i>and much, much more.</i>

41:15.130 --> 41:17.715
<i>Next time on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:17.799 --> 41:19.634
<i>This was
a really early bag seal.</i>

41:19.727 --> 41:23.062
- TE, Treasury of England.
- How about that!

41:23.222 --> 41:26.307
<i>RICK: The new premier of
Nova Scotia is coming for a visit.</i>

41:26.400 --> 41:28.401
- Let's go find the treasure.
- Get your shovels.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.810
<i>VANESSA:
We've got an oscillator here.</i>

41:29.904 --> 41:31.979
<i>Y'all are finally going big.</i>

41:32.064 --> 41:33.648
- ANDREW B.: Here we are now.
- RICK: Wow.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.241
- It looks like a battleship.
- (laughs)

41:35.400 --> 41:36.910
MARTY:
Okay, let's make hole.

41:37.069 --> 41:38.411
Let's find it!
It's exciting.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.404
<i>It's probably
the highest expectation</i>

41:40.489 --> 41:43.157
<i>I've ever had because
the physical presence of gold.</i>
