WEBVTT

00:13.766 --> 00:15.768
Is there a number we can call
for your parents?

00:15.851 --> 00:17.937
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

00:18.020 --> 00:19.230
Did you run away?

00:19.313 --> 00:21.232
-Are you in some kind of trouble?
-Is that blood?

00:22.024 --> 00:24.109
-Stop it! You're freaking her out!
-She's freaking me out!

00:24.193 --> 00:25.402
I bet she's deaf.

00:27.488 --> 00:28.572
Not deaf.

00:28.656 --> 00:31.951
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

00:38.582 --> 00:40.417
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

00:51.136 --> 00:52.388
- No, no, no!

00:52.471 --> 00:54.098
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

00:54.181 --> 00:57.434
- See over there?
- That's the bathroom.

00:57.518 --> 00:59.520
Privacy.
Get it?

01:14.743 --> 01:15.911
You don't want it closed?

01:17.746 --> 01:18.747
No.

01:18.831 --> 01:20.916
Oh, so you can speak.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.210
Okay, well...

01:23.294 --> 01:27.298
Um, how about we just keep the door...

01:29.550 --> 01:31.135
just like this.

01:31.635 --> 01:34.346
-Is that better?
-Yes.

01:39.977 --> 01:42.104
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.

01:42.187 --> 01:45.065
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

01:45.149 --> 01:46.859
She tried to get naked.

01:46.942 --> 01:48.569
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

01:48.652 --> 01:52.156
-Like, wrong in the head.
-She just went like...

01:52.239 --> 01:53.699
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

01:53.782 --> 01:56.410
-From where?
-The nuthouse in Kerley County.

01:56.493 --> 01:58.120
-You got a lot of family there?
-Bite me.

01:58.203 --> 02:00.205
Seriously though, think about it.

02:00.289 --> 02:03.334
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

02:03.417 --> 02:04.543
Why she went like...

02:04.627 --> 02:07.421
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

02:07.504 --> 02:09.506
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly!

02:09.590 --> 02:11.175
We should've never brought her here.

02:11.258 --> 02:12.593
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

02:12.676 --> 02:15.429
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

02:15.512 --> 02:17.222
-I think we should tell your mom.
-I second that.

02:17.306 --> 02:19.266
-Who's crazy now?
-How is that crazy?

02:19.350 --> 02:21.935
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

02:22.019 --> 02:24.355
-So?
-So if I tell my mom

02:24.438 --> 02:26.273
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

02:26.357 --> 02:28.609
-Oh, man.
-Our houses become Alcatraz.

02:28.692 --> 02:31.278
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

02:33.030 --> 02:35.574
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

02:35.658 --> 02:37.785
-You're letting a girl--
-Just listen!

02:37.868 --> 02:39.828
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

02:39.912 --> 02:41.955
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

02:42.039 --> 02:43.832
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

02:43.916 --> 02:46.168
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

02:46.251 --> 02:47.378
We'll be totally in the clear.

02:47.461 --> 02:49.254
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

02:49.338 --> 02:51.715
And this time, we find Will.

02:56.345 --> 02:58.347
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.724
You really think she's psycho?

03:00.808 --> 03:02.393
Wouldn't want her in my house.

03:06.814 --> 03:08.440
Mental.

03:10.609 --> 03:12.778
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

03:20.244 --> 03:21.495
Is that real?

03:24.331 --> 03:28.585
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.213
What's it mean?
Eleven?

03:34.550 --> 03:35.676
That's your name?

03:37.803 --> 03:39.847
Eleven. Okay.

03:39.930 --> 03:43.267
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

03:43.350 --> 03:46.562
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

03:50.607 --> 03:52.025
Um, well, okay.

03:52.943 --> 03:54.194
'Night, El.

03:56.447 --> 03:57.740
'Night, Mike.

05:52.145 --> 05:55.816
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

05:55.899 --> 05:58.694
-What? No, be careful of the poster.
-Yeah, okay. All right.

05:58.777 --> 06:00.654
-I can't eat.
-I just need you to eat, Mom.

06:00.737 --> 06:04.157
Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

06:04.241 --> 06:05.659
-Yeah.
-And I don't want you to go alone...

06:05.742 --> 06:06.827
No, I know.
I told you, I got it.

06:06.910 --> 06:09.329
...so I'm gonna have Karen take you,
'cause I should be here.

06:09.413 --> 06:11.790
-Okay.
-We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

06:11.873 --> 06:13.000
-How much is a copy?
-Yeah, okay.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.167
-Okay, Mom. Mom.
-Ten cents?

06:14.251 --> 06:16.878
- If we... Ten cents--
- Mom. Mom. Mom!

06:16.962 --> 06:19.214
You can't get like this, okay?

06:19.298 --> 06:21.717
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

06:24.303 --> 06:27.598
We've been waiting six hours.

06:27.681 --> 06:29.391
I know.
I came as soon as I could.

06:29.474 --> 06:31.059
Six hours.

06:31.143 --> 06:33.270
A little bit of trust here, all right?

06:33.353 --> 06:36.315
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

06:36.398 --> 06:38.066
-And?
-Nothing.

06:38.150 --> 06:39.568
God.

06:42.237 --> 06:43.655
Flo says you got a phone call?

06:43.739 --> 06:45.907
Oh, yeah.

06:53.206 --> 06:54.833
Storm barbecued this pretty good.

06:54.916 --> 06:57.336
-The storm?
-What else?

06:57.419 --> 07:00.339
You're saying that that's not weird?

07:00.422 --> 07:02.090
No, it's weird.

07:02.174 --> 07:04.676
Can we, like, trace who made the call?
Contact the--

07:04.760 --> 07:06.762
No, it doesn't work like that.

07:06.845 --> 07:08.597
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

07:08.680 --> 07:10.349
Because Flo said
you just heard some breathing.

07:10.432 --> 07:13.477
No. It was him.
It was Will.

07:14.478 --> 07:18.523
And he was scared.
And then something--

07:18.607 --> 07:21.443
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

07:21.526 --> 07:23.278
-Who would do that?
-Well, this thing's been on TV.

07:23.362 --> 07:26.531
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh...

07:26.615 --> 07:29.618
No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.

07:29.701 --> 07:32.329
-Joyce.
-Come on, how about a little trust here?

07:33.330 --> 07:35.624
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?

07:35.707 --> 07:37.167
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.711
All I'm saying is
it's an emotional time for you.

07:39.795 --> 07:43.090
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

07:43.173 --> 07:44.800
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

07:58.689 --> 08:01.858
-You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
-No.

08:02.442 --> 08:04.319
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

08:04.403 --> 08:06.071
Oh, come on!

08:06.154 --> 08:08.240
You're wasting your time.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.952
Hey, Hopper.

08:12.035 --> 08:14.204
Hopper.

08:14.287 --> 08:15.539
Let me go.

08:17.165 --> 08:18.959
-I'm sorry?
-To Lonnie's.

08:19.042 --> 08:21.920
You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

08:22.004 --> 08:24.423
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

08:24.506 --> 08:26.216
He'll... He'll hide.

08:26.299 --> 08:28.010
-You know, he's good at hiding.
-Yeah?

08:29.177 --> 08:31.430
Well, cops are good at finding.
Okay?

08:31.513 --> 08:33.181
Stay here with your mom.

08:34.391 --> 08:35.475
She needs you.

08:54.202 --> 08:56.830
Slow down, Mike.
That's disgusting.

08:58.290 --> 09:00.167
Do a lot of studying last night?

09:00.917 --> 09:02.836
Yeah, actually, I did.

09:02.919 --> 09:05.297
What was your test on again?
Human anatomy?

09:07.340 --> 09:09.092
Hey, what's going on?

09:10.385 --> 09:11.595
Nothing.

09:23.023 --> 09:24.399
Hey, you found my supercomm.

09:24.483 --> 09:25.650
Pretty cool, huh?

09:26.318 --> 09:27.611
I talk to my friends with it.

09:27.694 --> 09:29.571
Mostly Lucas,
'cause he lives so close.

09:29.654 --> 09:30.739
Signal's pretty weak.

09:34.951 --> 09:36.119
Got you breakfast.

09:38.705 --> 09:40.665
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

09:40.749 --> 09:42.084
but I just need you to go out there.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.294
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

09:44.377 --> 09:47.923
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

09:48.006 --> 09:52.135
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

09:52.219 --> 09:53.220
Understand?

09:54.346 --> 09:55.722
Really, it's no big deal.

09:55.806 --> 09:57.933
We'll just pretend
to meet each other again.

09:58.934 --> 10:01.603
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

10:04.064 --> 10:05.107
No.

10:06.399 --> 10:07.526
No?

10:08.360 --> 10:09.361
No.

10:10.362 --> 10:13.782
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

10:18.578 --> 10:21.123
You're in trouble, aren't you?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.002
Who...

10:27.462 --> 10:29.131
Who are you in trouble with?

10:31.883 --> 10:33.426
Bad.

10:33.510 --> 10:34.594
Bad?

10:35.595 --> 10:36.763
Bad people?

10:40.433 --> 10:42.477
They want to hurt you?

10:42.561 --> 10:43.979
The bad people?

10:53.738 --> 10:55.407
Understand?

10:56.491 --> 10:58.994
Michael, where are you?
We're going to be late.

10:59.077 --> 11:00.787
- Let's go!
- All right, I'll be back.

11:00.871 --> 11:02.622
Just stay here, okay?
Stay here.

11:09.963 --> 11:11.381
When was this?

11:11.464 --> 11:13.091
Last night.
Less than two miles away.

11:13.174 --> 11:14.968
-And the boy?
-Still missing.

11:15.719 --> 11:18.763
It was my son.
I know it.

11:18.847 --> 11:21.141
And I... I heard something else.

11:21.224 --> 11:22.601
Something else?

11:23.810 --> 11:27.314
It was like, uh,
some kind of animal.

11:27.397 --> 11:30.901
I don't know.
Just please tell Hop to hurry.

11:30.984 --> 11:33.904
Will! Will Byers!

11:34.779 --> 11:36.656
Will Byers!

11:39.200 --> 11:41.494
- Will!
- Will!

11:41.578 --> 11:44.331
Hey!
Anything?

11:45.290 --> 11:46.333
You?

11:47.292 --> 11:49.544
No, nothing but a dead phone.

11:49.628 --> 11:50.629
Joyce?

11:50.712 --> 11:53.465
About one step from falling off the edge.

11:53.548 --> 11:55.967
She's been a few steps
for a while now, hasn't she?

11:56.051 --> 11:57.802
Kid's missing, man.

11:57.886 --> 11:59.179
Show a little class.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.682
All right. Come on, let's go!

12:02.766 --> 12:05.018
We got a lot of ground to cover.

12:05.101 --> 12:07.520
The chief and her,
they've screwed before, huh?

12:10.065 --> 12:11.733
Will!

12:11.816 --> 12:13.276
That a "yeah" or did they...

12:14.319 --> 12:16.404
-Will!
-Will!

12:23.954 --> 12:27.374
"When alpha particles go through
gold foil, they become..."

12:27.457 --> 12:30.001
-Unoccupied space.
-"A molecule that can--"

12:30.085 --> 12:31.169
- Hey!
- I don't know,

12:31.252 --> 12:32.545
I think you've studied enough, Nance.

12:32.629 --> 12:34.673
- Steve--
- I'm telling you, you know, you got this.

12:34.756 --> 12:37.092
Don't worry.
Now, on to more important matters.

12:37.175 --> 12:40.136
My dad has left town on a conference
and my mom's gone with him,

12:40.220 --> 12:42.639
-'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him.
-Good call.

12:42.722 --> 12:43.723
So are you in?

12:43.807 --> 12:45.225
In for what?

12:45.308 --> 12:47.060
No parents? Big house?

12:47.727 --> 12:48.853
A party?

12:48.937 --> 12:50.855
- Ding, ding, ding!

12:50.981 --> 12:52.399
It's Tuesday.

12:52.482 --> 12:53.942
It's Tuesday!
Oh, my God.

12:54.025 --> 12:55.360
--Come on.

12:55.443 --> 12:57.195
It'll be low key.
It'll just be us.

12:57.278 --> 12:59.656
What do you say?
Are you in or are you out?

12:59.739 --> 13:03.576
-Um...
-Oh, God. Look.

13:04.577 --> 13:06.287
Oh, God, that's depressing.

13:08.498 --> 13:11.751
-Should we say something?
-I don't think he speaks.

13:11.835 --> 13:13.586
How much you want to bet he killed him?

13:13.670 --> 13:14.921
Shut up.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.722
Hey.

13:23.805 --> 13:25.390
Oh, hey.

13:25.473 --> 13:26.641
I just...

13:27.809 --> 13:31.104
I wanted to say, you know, um...

13:31.187 --> 13:33.106
I'm sorry about everything.

13:38.528 --> 13:40.822
Everyone's thinking about you.

13:42.949 --> 13:45.618
-It sucks.
-Yeah.

13:49.122 --> 13:50.373
I'm sure he's fine.

13:50.457 --> 13:52.125
He's a smart kid.

13:55.045 --> 13:56.921
I have to go.
Chemistry test.

13:57.005 --> 13:58.006
Yeah.

13:58.089 --> 13:59.549
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

14:04.345 --> 14:06.890
Attention, faculty and students.

14:06.973 --> 14:10.435
At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be
an assembly on the football field

14:10.518 --> 14:12.854
in support of Will Byers and his family.

14:12.937 --> 14:15.065
All are encouraged to attend.

14:15.148 --> 14:19.319
Volunteer sign-ups for search parties
are still available in the office.

14:25.492 --> 14:26.701
Oh, this is weird.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.163
-He's never this late.
-I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.

14:30.246 --> 14:31.498
I thought you liked his plan.

14:31.581 --> 14:33.917
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid,
or he'd be here.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.960
If his mom found out
a girl spent the night--

14:36.044 --> 14:37.545
He's in deep shit right about now.

14:37.629 --> 14:40.298
Hey, what if she slept naked?

14:40.382 --> 14:42.300
Oh, my God, she didn't.

14:42.384 --> 14:44.594
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...

14:44.677 --> 14:47.555
-No way. Mike would never rat us out.
-I don't know.

14:47.639 --> 14:50.850
All that matters is, after school,
the freak will be back in the loony bin,

14:50.934 --> 14:54.062
and we can focus on what really matters,
finding Will.

15:10.203 --> 15:11.413
You want anything to drink?

15:11.496 --> 15:14.165
We have OJ, skim milk...
What else?

15:15.500 --> 15:16.876
Um, we have...

15:18.795 --> 15:20.547
Oh, this is my living room.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.173
It's mostly just for watching TV.

15:22.257 --> 15:24.801
Nice, right?
It's a 22-inch.

15:24.884 --> 15:26.970
That's, like, ten times bigger
than Dustin's.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.692
-Pretty.
-I guess.

15:40.775 --> 15:42.193
That's my sister Nancy.

15:42.277 --> 15:43.903
And that's baby Holly.

15:43.987 --> 15:45.363
And those are my parents.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.157
What are your parents like?

15:47.782 --> 15:49.200
Do they live close?

15:51.619 --> 15:53.204
That's our La-Z-Boy.

15:54.914 --> 15:56.166
It's where my dad sleeps.

15:56.249 --> 15:58.960
You can try it if you want.

15:59.627 --> 16:00.628
Yeah.

16:01.963 --> 16:02.964
It's fun.

16:06.593 --> 16:08.428
Just trust me, okay?

16:14.267 --> 16:15.935
See? Fun, right?

-Yeah, really.

The Smiths...

I don't want to hear it.

17:39.978 --> 17:42.730

-I don't know.
-No, all right? He hasn't.

17:48.152 --> 17:49.988
He's trying to force you
to like normal things.

17:50.071 --> 17:53.116
And you shouldn't like things because
people tell you you're supposed to.

- I'm not here to work.

18:46.502 --> 18:47.920
I...

18:48.004 --> 18:50.131
The storm last night, I...

18:50.757 --> 18:52.925
I need a new phone.

18:54.135 --> 18:57.555
Okay, that looks like $22.56.

18:57.639 --> 18:59.432
Uh, yeah, you know, uh...

18:59.515 --> 19:01.809
I gave Jonathan all my money for...

19:01.893 --> 19:03.686
for the copies for the posters.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.148
Uh, I need an advance.

19:08.066 --> 19:09.567
Yes, well, of course.

19:09.651 --> 19:11.235
- Of course.
- Thank you.

19:16.157 --> 19:18.660
Yeah, uh, I was thinking,
two weeks?

19:20.912 --> 19:22.163
Um...

19:23.956 --> 19:27.293
Yes, I understand, but, you know,
I have to pay Jeffrey for covering--

19:27.377 --> 19:28.378
Donald.

19:28.461 --> 19:31.673
I've been here ten years, right?

19:31.756 --> 19:35.718
Have I ever called in sick
or missed a shift once?

19:35.802 --> 19:39.180
I've worked, uh,
Christmas Eve and Thanksgiving.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.684
I don't know
where my boy is.

19:42.767 --> 19:43.976
He's gone.

19:44.060 --> 19:48.106
I don't know if I'm...
gonna ever see him again, if he's hurt...

19:49.857 --> 19:51.192
I, uh...

19:52.735 --> 19:56.447
I need this phone
and two weeks' advance.

20:00.076 --> 20:01.828
And a pack of Camels.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.132
- We're all clear.
- Copy that.

21:11.481 --> 21:13.107
Extraordinary.

21:16.486 --> 21:18.946
Ready are you?
What knows you of ready?

21:19.030 --> 21:20.323
His name's Yoda.

21:20.406 --> 21:23.534
He can use the Force to move things
with his mind, like this.

21:23.618 --> 21:24.952
Whoosh!

21:26.704 --> 21:28.414
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

21:28.498 --> 21:30.333
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth
so he can roar.

21:39.091 --> 21:41.385
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

21:41.469 --> 21:43.805
We got first every year.

21:43.888 --> 21:46.599
Except for last year when we got third.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.768
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.

22:08.746 --> 22:09.872
You know Will?

22:10.915 --> 22:15.044
Did you see him? Last night?
On the road?

22:21.551 --> 22:22.718
We gotta go.

22:26.264 --> 22:28.307
I bought pizza
and macaroni.

22:28.391 --> 22:29.934
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.565
Ted? Is that you?

22:35.648 --> 22:36.857
Just me, Mom!

22:36.941 --> 22:39.610
-Mike? What are you doing home?
-One second!

22:44.031 --> 22:45.950
In here.
I'll be right back, okay?

22:46.033 --> 22:48.744
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

22:48.828 --> 22:50.788
Do you understand?

22:50.871 --> 22:52.456
I won't tell her about you.
I promise.

22:52.540 --> 22:53.916
Promise?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.002
It means something that you can't break.

22:56.085 --> 22:58.004
- Ever.
- Michael?

22:58.629 --> 22:59.672
Please?

23:17.440 --> 23:18.733
Pop!

23:22.945 --> 23:24.280
Papa!

23:25.573 --> 23:26.866
Papa!

23:26.949 --> 23:28.284
No!

23:29.201 --> 23:30.328
Papa!

23:30.411 --> 23:32.747
No! No!
No!

23:37.543 --> 23:38.586
Papa!

23:38.669 --> 23:40.338
- Papa!

23:40.421 --> 23:41.839
Papa!

23:41.922 --> 23:44.008
Papa!

23:44.091 --> 23:45.259
Papa!

23:48.846 --> 23:49.889
Papa.

23:59.482 --> 24:01.901
I just... I don't feel good.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.654
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

24:04.737 --> 24:06.947
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

24:07.031 --> 24:08.407
but the last time I told you I was sick

24:08.491 --> 24:10.409
-you made me go to school anyway, and--
-Michael.

24:10.493 --> 24:13.329
-Yeah?
-I'm not mad at you.

24:13.412 --> 24:16.707
-No?
-No, of course not.

24:19.043 --> 24:21.962
All this that's been going on with Will,

24:22.046 --> 24:24.173
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you.

24:25.508 --> 24:26.967
I just...

24:27.510 --> 24:29.512
I want you to feel like
you can talk to me.

24:29.595 --> 24:33.349
I never want you to feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

24:33.432 --> 24:35.559
I'm here for you. Okay?

24:38.145 --> 24:39.313
Is there someone else here?

24:41.023 --> 24:42.024
No.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.528
Eleven?

24:45.611 --> 24:47.196
Is everything okay?

24:47.279 --> 24:48.322
El?

24:52.743 --> 24:54.704
- Mike.
- Is everything okay?

24:57.665 --> 24:59.125
Are you sure?

25:00.418 --> 25:01.794
Promise.

25:37.830 --> 25:41.333
- Will Byers!
- Will!

25:43.544 --> 25:44.962
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.256
I need you alive for the next few days,
at least.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.592
Oh, hell, I could survive that.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.803
What?
George Burness made the jump.

25:52.887 --> 25:55.222
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

25:55.306 --> 25:56.307
George is a liar.

25:56.390 --> 25:59.268
You make that jump from this height,
that water turns into cement.

25:59.351 --> 26:01.854
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.150
Nah.

26:06.233 --> 26:08.027
Chief, you copy?

26:09.612 --> 26:11.113
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

26:11.197 --> 26:13.949
Hey, Chief, we got a call
from over at Benny's.

26:14.033 --> 26:15.868
I think you need to get there right away.

26:38.808 --> 26:40.309
Ugh, Jesus!

26:46.482 --> 26:47.608
Suicide?

26:49.068 --> 26:50.569
Mmm-hmm.

26:50.653 --> 26:52.738
Missing kid, suicide...

26:52.822 --> 26:55.533
You must feel like a big city cop again,
huh, Chief?

26:57.243 --> 26:59.995
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

27:02.456 --> 27:04.250
Benny was my friend.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.329
Hello?

27:43.622 --> 27:44.832
Yeah.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.254
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, is Lonnie around?

27:50.337 --> 27:52.339
-Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
-To look around.

27:52.423 --> 27:54.925
-Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
-I'll be fast.

27:55.009 --> 27:56.343
Hey, Will?

27:56.427 --> 27:57.803
Will!

27:57.887 --> 27:59.972
Will, you here?
Will!

28:04.894 --> 28:06.103
Get off!

28:07.271 --> 28:08.856
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

28:08.939 --> 28:11.066
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

28:12.026 --> 28:15.321
Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

28:15.404 --> 28:16.405
My oldest.

28:18.490 --> 28:21.368
-Come here.
-Get off me, man.

28:34.548 --> 28:36.842
-Are you out of your mind?
-Just listen to me.

28:36.926 --> 28:38.719
-You are out of your mind!
-She knows about Will.

28:38.802 --> 28:40.512
What do you mean she knows about Will?

28:41.639 --> 28:44.683
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

28:44.767 --> 28:46.644
- You could tell?
- Just think about it.

28:46.727 --> 28:48.938
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

28:49.021 --> 28:50.648
the same place where Will disappeared?

28:50.731 --> 28:53.025
-That is weird.
-And she said bad people are after her.

28:53.108 --> 28:56.403
I think maybe these bad people
are the same ones that took Will.

28:56.487 --> 28:59.865
-I think she knows what happened to him.
-Then why doesn't she tell us?

29:02.034 --> 29:04.078
Do you know where he is?

29:04.161 --> 29:05.162
Do you know where Will is?

29:05.246 --> 29:07.581
-Stop it, you're scaring her!
-She should be scared!

29:07.665 --> 29:10.542
If you know where he is, tell us!

29:11.877 --> 29:14.421
This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.924
No! Eleven said telling any adult
would put us in danger.

29:17.007 --> 29:19.426
-What kind of danger?
-Her name is Eleven?

29:19.510 --> 29:22.012
-El for short.
-Mike, what kind of danger?

29:22.096 --> 29:23.722
Danger danger.

29:29.561 --> 29:31.480
No, no, no!

29:31.563 --> 29:34.316
We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.

29:45.911 --> 29:46.996
No.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.921
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

29:56.005 --> 29:57.881
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

29:58.882 --> 30:01.760
Really?
You want to check up my ass, too?

30:02.428 --> 30:04.263
I told you the same thing
as I told those cops,

30:04.346 --> 30:05.931
he's not here and he never has been.

30:06.015 --> 30:09.018
-Then why didn't you call Mom back?
-I don't know, I just...

30:09.101 --> 30:11.603
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.230
You know, he was lost or something.

30:14.273 --> 30:16.567
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

30:16.650 --> 30:19.778
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

30:19.862 --> 30:21.196
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

30:23.324 --> 30:26.410
Tell your mother
she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.454
Come out here to the city.

30:28.537 --> 30:30.164
People are more real here, you know?

30:31.540 --> 30:32.958
And then I could see you more.

30:35.127 --> 30:37.588
-What, you think I don't want to see you?
-I know you don't.

30:37.671 --> 30:39.715
See, that's your mother talkin'
right there.

30:40.966 --> 30:42.092
She even know you're here?

30:43.135 --> 30:44.136
Oh, great.

30:44.219 --> 30:46.930
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

30:47.014 --> 30:48.807
Some real fine parenting right there.

30:48.891 --> 30:52.644
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?

30:57.358 --> 30:59.026
In case you forgot what he looks like.

31:02.613 --> 31:04.365
He's kinda cute, hmm?

31:04.448 --> 31:06.492
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

31:08.952 --> 31:10.496
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

31:14.041 --> 31:15.459
You, uh, notice anything...

31:16.502 --> 31:17.878
odd about him the last few weeks?

31:17.961 --> 31:21.215
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

31:21.298 --> 31:23.425
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.

31:23.509 --> 31:25.719
He got any enemies you might know about?

31:25.803 --> 31:27.888
I mean,
people who might not want him around?

31:27.971 --> 31:30.974
The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but...

31:31.975 --> 31:33.519
nah.

31:33.602 --> 31:37.356
-When was the last time you saw him?
-Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

31:37.439 --> 31:39.691
-Just you and the boys?
-Yep.

31:39.775 --> 31:41.860
Me and Henry and...

31:43.153 --> 31:45.697
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

31:46.698 --> 31:47.825
No kid did this.

31:48.784 --> 31:49.827
Kid?

31:51.245 --> 31:52.704
What are you talking about?

31:52.788 --> 31:57.709
Yeah. At lunch, uh,
there was this boy that, uh...

31:57.793 --> 32:00.546
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

32:00.629 --> 32:02.005
Can you imagine that?

32:04.967 --> 32:06.009
This kid...

32:07.636 --> 32:08.762
what'd he look like?

32:09.930 --> 32:13.225
Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.

32:13.308 --> 32:15.686
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.

32:15.769 --> 32:17.229
He look like this?

32:18.021 --> 32:20.941
Oh, no, that's...
That's Lonnie's missin' kid.

32:21.024 --> 32:23.068
No. This was a different kid.

32:23.152 --> 32:24.611
This one had really short hair.

32:24.695 --> 32:26.780
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

32:26.864 --> 32:29.491
Yeah, well, let's...
You know, let's forget about the haircut.

32:29.575 --> 32:32.661
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

32:32.744 --> 32:34.121
could it be Lonnie's kid?

32:34.872 --> 32:37.166
Well, I...
I didn't get a good look at him.

32:39.168 --> 32:41.128
About the right height, though.

32:41.211 --> 32:42.880
I mean, could've been.

32:43.964 --> 32:45.632
Yeah, that's...

32:45.716 --> 32:46.717
Could've been.

32:50.220 --> 32:52.931
Because I don't want to go by myself.

32:53.015 --> 32:56.185
Barb...
Barb, it's not rocket science.

32:56.268 --> 32:59.646
You just tell your parents you're gonna
stay at my place afterwards.

32:59.730 --> 33:02.608
No, tell them we're... studying.

33:02.691 --> 33:04.401
Nancy! Dinner!

33:04.485 --> 33:06.195
Coming!

33:06.278 --> 33:08.947
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.

33:18.665 --> 33:20.292
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

33:21.168 --> 33:24.213
Oh, no, I had two
bologna sandwiches for lunch.

33:26.006 --> 33:27.007
I don't know why.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.967
Me, too.

33:30.177 --> 33:32.513
-It's delicious, Mommy.
-Thank you, sweetie.

33:33.347 --> 33:34.973
So, there's this...

33:35.057 --> 33:37.559
special assembly thing tonight...

33:37.643 --> 33:39.937
for Will at the school field.

33:40.020 --> 33:41.021
Barb's driving.

33:41.104 --> 33:43.273
Why am I just hearing about this?

33:44.149 --> 33:45.192
I thought you knew.

33:45.275 --> 33:48.362
I told you, I don't want you
out after dark until Will is found.

33:48.445 --> 33:51.782
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

33:51.865 --> 33:53.909
I mean, everyone's going.

33:57.162 --> 33:59.081
Just... be back by 10:00.

34:00.499 --> 34:01.667
Why don't you take the boys, too?

34:01.750 --> 34:02.960
-No!
-Mmm-mmm.

34:04.628 --> 34:06.713
Don't you think you should be there?
For Will?

34:10.759 --> 34:13.011
Sorry. Spasm.

34:16.890 --> 34:19.142
--Oh...

34:19.226 --> 34:20.435
It's okay, Holly.

34:20.519 --> 34:22.354
-It's just a loud noise.
-Nice.

34:24.064 --> 34:26.358
--Will!

34:28.443 --> 34:31.655
Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

34:41.999 --> 34:44.876
Hey, you think
Earl really saw Will?

34:44.960 --> 34:47.921
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

34:48.005 --> 34:49.590
And stealing food from Benny?

34:49.673 --> 34:52.342
Tell you what,
when we find him, we'll ask.

34:52.426 --> 34:54.052
Can't ask a corpse questions.

34:54.136 --> 34:55.929
--Hold up!

34:56.013 --> 34:57.472
You got something?

35:00.642 --> 35:02.769
- Hey, what do you got?
- Not sure.

35:02.853 --> 35:04.771
Maybe nothing.

35:04.855 --> 35:06.773
I found this. In there.

35:11.486 --> 35:13.655
No way a kid
crawls through there.

35:14.698 --> 35:16.408
I don't know...

35:16.491 --> 35:17.868
a scared enough one might.

35:17.951 --> 35:20.329
His brother said he was good at hiding.

35:56.448 --> 35:57.449
El?

36:03.246 --> 36:06.208
No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.

36:09.670 --> 36:12.798
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.

36:12.881 --> 36:15.300
They promise.
Right?

36:15.384 --> 36:17.928
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

36:19.262 --> 36:20.305
Ow!

36:20.389 --> 36:25.018
What Dustin is trying to say
is that they were just scared... earlier.

36:25.102 --> 36:26.144
That's all.

36:26.228 --> 36:28.146
We just wanted to find our friend.

36:28.730 --> 36:29.773
"Friend"?

36:29.856 --> 36:32.734
Yeah, friend.
Will?

36:32.818 --> 36:36.113
What is "friend"?

36:36.196 --> 36:37.614
Is she serious?

36:40.283 --> 36:41.702
Um, a friend--

36:41.785 --> 36:43.537
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

36:43.620 --> 36:46.748
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

36:46.832 --> 36:48.125
And they never break a promise.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.127
-Especially when there's spit.
-Spit?

36:50.210 --> 36:53.964
- A spit swear means...
- you never break your word.

36:54.047 --> 36:55.465
It's a bond.

36:55.549 --> 36:59.219
That's super important, because friends...

36:59.302 --> 37:01.555
they tell each other things.

37:01.638 --> 37:03.390
Things that parents don't know.

37:10.230 --> 37:12.274
- Barbara, pull over.
- What?

37:12.357 --> 37:13.650
Pull over!

37:16.361 --> 37:18.238
What are we doing here?

37:18.321 --> 37:19.906
His house is three blocks away.

37:19.990 --> 37:21.450
We can't park in the driveway.

37:21.533 --> 37:22.576
Are you serious?

37:22.659 --> 37:23.785
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

37:23.869 --> 37:26.580
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

37:26.663 --> 37:28.498
Calm down, Barb.
Come on.

37:28.582 --> 37:31.126
You promised that you'd go.
You're coming.

37:31.209 --> 37:32.461
We're gonna have a great time.

37:32.544 --> 37:34.087
He just wants to get in your pants.

37:34.171 --> 37:35.797
No, he doesn't.

37:35.881 --> 37:38.175
Nance... seriously.

37:39.301 --> 37:41.344
He invited you to his house.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.346
His parents aren't home.

37:44.014 --> 37:45.682
Come on, you are not this stupid.

37:45.766 --> 37:47.768
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.

37:47.851 --> 37:50.937
Tommy and Carol have been
having sex since, like, seventh grade.

37:51.938 --> 37:53.899
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.943
-Gross.
-I'm serious!

37:57.027 --> 37:58.320
All right, well...

37:59.321 --> 38:02.574
you can be, like, my guardian. All right?

38:02.657 --> 38:05.118
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

38:05.202 --> 38:06.203
Ugh.

38:09.539 --> 38:10.749
Is that a new bra?

38:12.417 --> 38:13.543
No.

38:26.306 --> 38:27.974
Barb, chill.

38:28.892 --> 38:30.268
I'm chill.

38:35.357 --> 38:36.733
Hello, ladies.

39:08.849 --> 39:10.308
What are you doing?

39:11.309 --> 39:12.811
It's freezing.

39:18.692 --> 39:20.068
You ever feel cursed?

39:23.530 --> 39:26.575
You know, the last person
to go missing here was in, uh...

39:28.368 --> 39:29.953
the summer of '23.

39:31.621 --> 39:33.915
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

39:39.212 --> 39:41.673
When'd the last person freeze to death?

39:45.176 --> 39:47.387
Hey, come back inside.

39:47.470 --> 39:49.472
Warm me up. Just...

39:52.100 --> 39:53.685
Just give me a minute out here.

40:20.378 --> 40:22.130
What's the weirdo doing?

40:28.178 --> 40:29.220
El?

40:42.817 --> 40:43.902
Will.

40:44.569 --> 40:45.570
Superpowers.

40:52.702 --> 40:55.622
Did you see him?
On Mirkwood?

40:57.040 --> 40:58.249
Do you know where he is?

41:14.140 --> 41:15.850
I don't understand.

41:16.768 --> 41:17.936
Hiding.

41:18.061 --> 41:19.688
Will is hiding?

41:24.442 --> 41:26.027
From the bad men?

41:28.947 --> 41:30.615
Then from who?

42:34.262 --> 42:35.805
Where are you?

43:04.876 --> 43:07.170
--One! Two!

43:07.253 --> 43:09.923
- Three!
- Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!

43:10.006 --> 43:12.675
--You're such an asshole, Tommy.

43:27.899 --> 43:29.609
Is that supposed to impress me?

43:30.401 --> 43:33.488
-You're not?
-You are a cliché, you do realize that?

43:33.571 --> 43:34.614
You are a cliché.

43:34.697 --> 43:37.117
What with your...
your grades and your band practice.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.618
I'm so not in band.

43:38.701 --> 43:41.621
Okay, party girl. Why don't you just, uh,
show us how it's done, then?

43:41.704 --> 43:42.705
Okay.

43:49.838 --> 43:51.756
-You gotta make a little hole right in--
-I got it.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.050
Yeah, she's smart, you douche!

43:58.680 --> 44:00.807
Chug, chug, chug.

44:00.890 --> 44:02.350
Chug. Chug. Chug.

44:14.904 --> 44:16.156
Barb, you wanna try?

44:16.990 --> 44:18.533
What? No.

44:18.616 --> 44:19.868
No, I don't want to. Thanks.

44:19.951 --> 44:21.077
- Come on.
- Yeah...

44:21.161 --> 44:22.495
- Come on. Yeah.
- Nance, I don't want to.

44:22.579 --> 44:24.289
-It's fun! Just give it a--
-Nance...

44:24.372 --> 44:26.040
Just... Just give it a shot.

44:28.251 --> 44:29.294
Okay.

44:34.883 --> 44:36.009
So you just...

44:40.722 --> 44:42.765
- Gnarly.
- Are you okay?

44:42.849 --> 44:44.309
- Yeah.
- Barb, you're bleeding.

44:44.392 --> 44:46.352
I'm fine.
Where's your bathroom?

44:46.436 --> 44:49.022
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down past
the kitchen, to the left.

44:49.105 --> 44:50.690
Okay. Thanks.

44:53.651 --> 44:55.194
Oh.

45:04.078 --> 45:07.206
Oh, my, God!
What the hell, Tommy?

45:07.290 --> 45:08.291
No!

45:09.918 --> 45:11.836
--Whoo!

45:52.001 --> 45:53.044
Hello?

45:55.254 --> 45:57.840
- Hello.

45:57.924 --> 45:59.759
Who is this?

46:02.845 --> 46:05.098
- Will?

46:06.557 --> 46:09.310
--Will, it's me.

46:09.394 --> 46:11.145
Talk to me.

46:11.229 --> 46:12.605
I'm here.

46:12.689 --> 46:14.565
Just tell me where you are, honey.

46:14.649 --> 46:16.609
- I can hear you. Please.

46:17.610 --> 46:19.278
- Mom?

46:19.362 --> 46:20.738
Will!

46:20.822 --> 46:24.450
Yes, it's me.
It's me.

46:24.534 --> 46:26.828
Where are you? Where are you?
Just talk to me--

46:29.497 --> 46:30.540
Oh, no, no!

46:30.623 --> 46:31.666
No!

46:31.749 --> 46:33.251
No!

46:33.334 --> 46:36.045
Oh, no! No, no...

46:38.923 --> 46:40.216
No!

46:46.305 --> 46:48.182
No!

47:04.699 --> 47:06.075
Jonathan?

47:08.703 --> 47:09.704
What...

47:41.402 --> 47:42.445
Will...

47:54.624 --> 47:56.209
Will...

47:57.335 --> 47:59.003
Will, is that you?

48:22.276 --> 48:23.653
Oh, my God.

48:26.364 --> 48:27.949
Oh, God...

48:30.910 --> 48:33.037
Oh, my God...

49:17.248 --> 49:19.125
--I'm freezing.

49:19.208 --> 49:23.504
Hmm... well, I hear his
mom's room has a fireplace.

49:23.588 --> 49:24.839
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, yeah?

49:24.922 --> 49:27.258
Okay, well, you know,
you are cleaning the sheets.

49:27.341 --> 49:28.593
-You all right?
-Yeah.

49:28.676 --> 49:31.345
Yeah?
Come on, let's get you some dry clothes.

49:36.893 --> 49:38.186
Nance!

49:38.311 --> 49:39.604
Nancy.

49:40.563 --> 49:42.315
Where are you going?

49:42.398 --> 49:43.441
Nowhere.

49:43.524 --> 49:45.359
Just... upstairs.

49:45.443 --> 49:47.069
To change.

49:47.153 --> 49:49.906
I... fell in the pool.

49:52.658 --> 49:54.535
Why don't you go ahead and go home.

49:54.619 --> 49:56.996
I'll just... I'll get a ride or something.

49:57.079 --> 49:58.456
Nance...

49:59.207 --> 50:00.917
Barb...

50:01.000 --> 50:02.585
I'm fine.

50:02.668 --> 50:05.087
This isn't you.

50:06.214 --> 50:07.840
I'm fine.

50:07.924 --> 50:11.510
Just... go ahead and go home, okay?

50:31.405 --> 50:32.657
Thanks.

50:37.453 --> 50:38.996
Um...

50:39.080 --> 50:40.706
some privacy, maybe?

50:40.790 --> 50:42.291
Oh...

50:42.375 --> 50:44.001
Yeah, right.
Sorry.

50:48.756 --> 50:49.799
Steve?

51:03.813 --> 51:04.981
Damn.

51:07.316 --> 51:08.567
Shut up.
