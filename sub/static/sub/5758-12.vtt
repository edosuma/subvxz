00:01.531 --> 00:03.890
Previously on <i>Pretty Little Liars</i>

00:03.915 --> 00:05.116
Did "A" send this to you?

00:05.154 --> 00:08.093
- No. I took it out of Paige's bag.
- Why would Paige have it?

00:08.118 --> 00:09.346
She may be "A," Aria.

00:09.393 --> 00:11.621
- Are you Emily Fields?
- Yes.

00:11.643 --> 00:12.843
I'm Maya's cousin Nate.

00:12.877 --> 00:13.943
Maggie: You must be Amy!

00:13.979 --> 00:15.512
- Are you Maggie?
- I am.

00:15.547 --> 00:17.548
I like this age.
It's so sweet.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.583
Malcolm happens to be my son.

00:19.618 --> 00:20.951
I'm not gonna ask you
to explain anything,

00:20.986 --> 00:22.886
because you won't...
I'll find out for myself.

00:22.921 --> 00:25.489
Emily: I think we need to keep
things on a friendship level.

00:25.523 --> 00:27.658
- What about the other night?
- It doesn't change things.

00:27.692 --> 00:31.962
I am going to help you stop "A," and
I'm not asking for your permission.

00:31.997 --> 00:35.599
You and Paige have been seeing each
other on and off for almost a year,

00:35.634 --> 00:37.901
and she's never mentioned
anything about Ali to you?

00:37.936 --> 00:41.005
Are you finished?
Because I am.

00:46.011 --> 00:47.945
( Siren wails )

00:49.848 --> 00:51.982
( Hanna crying )

01:09.601 --> 01:12.603
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay.

01:12.637 --> 01:15.606
So, the deceased
was a friend of yours?

01:17.642 --> 01:19.810
( Sobbing )

01:19.844 --> 01:23.614
Miss Fields, please. I'm trying
to understand what happened here.

01:23.648 --> 01:27.484
Did you know the victim?
Yes.

01:27.519 --> 01:28.952
The deceased was
a friend of yours?

01:56.848 --> 01:59.650
TV: <i>Jury selection is
expected to conclude today,</i>

01:59.684 --> 02:01.652
<i>and defense attorney</i>
<i>Veronica Hastings</i>

02:01.686 --> 02:04.455
<i>made a statement to reporters</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

02:04.489 --> 02:06.824
Veronica: <i>My client</i>
<i>is emotionally exhausted.</i>

02:06.858 --> 02:09.893
<i>But he's relieved to know that he's
finally going to have the opportunity</i>

02:09.928 --> 02:11.729
<i>to clear his name.</i>

02:11.763 --> 02:13.797
How did this get so big?

02:13.832 --> 02:17.735
I mean, it's like all eyes
are on Rosewood.

02:17.802 --> 02:21.672
Can't help but think that Toby took that job
in bucks county just to avoid all this.

02:21.706 --> 02:25.509
She's taking the long way because reporters
are hounding her for interviews.

02:25.543 --> 02:28.645
Okay, how are we gonna do this?
Well,

02:28.680 --> 02:30.948
Emily think she's coming over
here so we can apologize.

02:30.982 --> 02:32.916
But when she realizes
what this is,

02:32.951 --> 02:35.719
she'll probably be more mad
at us than she was before.

02:35.754 --> 02:37.755
I am not looking forward
to seeing that.

02:37.789 --> 02:40.924
In a successful intervention, the
loved one feels safe, not judged.

02:40.959 --> 02:43.627
Aria: Great. Right,

02:43.661 --> 02:44.928
so we'll start out
all warm and fuzzy,

02:44.963 --> 02:46.897
and then we just have to
hit her with the truth.

02:46.931 --> 02:48.599
Yeah. And that's your cue.

02:48.633 --> 02:52.669
Okay, so... Paige was
jealous of Ali,

02:52.704 --> 02:54.772
we know that Paige
was jealous of Maya,

02:54.806 --> 02:56.840
and she was with Emily
that night,

02:56.875 --> 02:58.976
it was easy for her
to set us up.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.677
Right. And she has
the other earring.

03:00.712 --> 03:02.446
So she must have
Ali's body, right?

03:02.480 --> 03:03.614
Yeah.
I don't get it.

03:03.648 --> 03:06.617
If Paige was so into Emily,
why would she drug her?

03:06.651 --> 03:08.652
And then why would
she drug herself?

03:08.686 --> 03:11.555
Hanna, I thought we were all
on the same "A" page here.

03:11.589 --> 03:13.624
We are. This is
a practice run.

03:13.658 --> 03:15.526
Right, okay.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.928
Uh, drugging yourself
is the best alibi ever.

03:17.962 --> 03:21.632
Classic Sharon stone move. Remember
that movie, basic instinct?

03:21.666 --> 03:22.866
No.
No.

03:22.901 --> 03:25.869
She wrote
a murder mystery novel

03:25.904 --> 03:27.938
to cover up a crime
that she was about to commit.

03:27.972 --> 03:29.940
It was actually kind of genius.

03:29.974 --> 03:32.810
Look, remember, I'm Emily here.

03:32.844 --> 03:36.480
We still think that
"A" is working with Mona.

03:36.514 --> 03:38.549
So what is your connection?

03:38.583 --> 03:39.883
Two people who hated Ali.

03:39.918 --> 03:42.686
Maybe one of them killed her and
the other one covered their tracks.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.488
Or are <i>still</i> covering their tracks

03:44.522 --> 03:45.889
by stealing the body
and then pinning it on us.

03:45.924 --> 03:50.828
Yeah. And the ultimate prize is
Paige gets Emily all to herself.

03:50.862 --> 03:52.963
( Knocking ) Hey.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.571
Hey, em.
Emily: Hi.

04:03.508 --> 04:06.476
Hey. You want
some coffee?

04:08.546 --> 04:11.515
Hanna: Em, you know how
much we love you, right?

04:11.549 --> 04:15.586
We love you enough to tell you
the truth, even when it hurts.

04:15.620 --> 04:17.553
This doesn't sound
like an apology.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.589
I had to get you here, Emily.

04:19.624 --> 04:21.591
I'm sorry for lying.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.727
What is this?

04:23.761 --> 04:26.864
It's the three people who love
you the most in the world

04:26.898 --> 04:29.566
trying to get you to see
who Paige really is.

04:29.601 --> 04:31.668
I can't believe it.

04:31.703 --> 04:34.504
The trial's started, and this
how you guys show up for me.

04:34.539 --> 04:36.506
We support you, Emily.
We do.

04:36.541 --> 04:38.675
But we're pretty sure that
Garrett did not kill Maya.

04:38.710 --> 04:41.712
And you think Paige did? Are you
out of your friggin' minds?

04:41.746 --> 04:45.749
When did it become so easy
for you lie to your friends?

04:46.851 --> 04:48.852
Emily, wait.

04:52.624 --> 04:55.826
We found that at the trunk show.
In Paige's pack.

04:55.860 --> 04:58.762
It's the other earring
Aria put in Ali's casket.

04:58.796 --> 05:03.433
We found a lot of other things
exactly where "A" has put them.

05:03.468 --> 05:06.470
Three against one.
"A" wins.

05:10.475 --> 05:11.808
That was exactly
what Paige wanted.

05:11.843 --> 05:14.845
Great. So now what?

05:23.821 --> 05:25.422
Hey.

05:25.456 --> 05:27.624
Em wasn't in first period.

05:27.659 --> 05:29.559
I think she ditched
school today.

05:29.594 --> 05:31.862
Does three messages and six
texts make me a stalker?

05:31.896 --> 05:35.666
This is the part where
you're supposed to reassure me

05:35.700 --> 05:39.436
that I'm just being a caring friend
and Emily's going to be fine.

05:39.470 --> 05:42.706
She was totally right in calling
me out for lying this morning.

05:42.740 --> 05:46.710
So if anybody needs
an intervention, it's me.

05:46.744 --> 05:48.812
What's going on?

05:48.846 --> 05:51.548
I haven't told you guys yet
because Ezra doesn't even know.

05:51.582 --> 05:54.851
Well, whatever it is, we're here for you.
I'll be okay.

05:54.886 --> 06:00.490
Wes let it slip that Ezra got a girl
pregnant before he left for college.

06:00.525 --> 06:02.859
Their mom paid her
to take of it,

06:02.894 --> 06:06.463
but she <i>didn't</i> take care of it,
she had the baby.

06:06.497 --> 06:08.832
It's a little boy.
Ezra has a kid?

06:08.866 --> 06:10.867
Yeah, and I'm not done.
Wait, there's more?

06:10.902 --> 06:15.472
I found the baby's mom...
But I didn't tell Ezra.

06:15.506 --> 06:17.841
So Ezra has no idea?

06:17.875 --> 06:20.444
He thinks she had an abortion.

06:20.478 --> 06:22.479
Aria, you have to
tell him the truth.

06:22.513 --> 06:24.548
Well, for whatever reason,
she doesn't want him to know.

06:24.582 --> 06:26.550
And I pushed him to call her.

06:26.584 --> 06:27.884
When they talked, she didn't
say anything about it.

06:27.919 --> 06:30.620
If he finds out that you knew
and you didn't tell him...

06:30.655 --> 06:34.458
I just really feel like I'm about to
rattle the cage of a sleeping giant.

06:37.528 --> 06:41.498
Do you remember what Ali said
about secrets keeping us close?

06:41.532 --> 06:43.567
She was wrong.

06:43.601 --> 06:46.603
They tear us apart.

06:46.637 --> 06:47.871
( Bell rings )

07:01.719 --> 07:05.389
If you've got something
to say, just say it.

07:05.423 --> 07:08.392
Emily called me
this morning in tears.

07:08.426 --> 07:10.527
What the hell
is wrong with you guys?

07:10.561 --> 07:12.863
What do you want, Paige?

07:12.897 --> 07:14.865
I want you to
leave Emily alone.

07:14.899 --> 07:16.700
She's got a lot
going on right now,

07:16.734 --> 07:18.568
she doesn't need you guys
making it worse for her.

07:18.603 --> 07:20.604
If you think
I'm gonna let you hurt her,

07:20.638 --> 07:22.506
you are underestimating me.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.809
If you don't back down, you're the
one who's gonna get hurt, Spencer.

07:25.843 --> 07:28.845
I won't let you
come between us.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.814
I know who you are.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.454
( Slams locker door )

07:45.863 --> 07:49.466
They think they know you,
but they're wrong.

07:50.935 --> 07:53.537
Do they just not want you
to be happy?

07:53.571 --> 07:56.506
They don't trust <i>anybody.</i>
<i>It's because of "A."</i>

07:56.541 --> 07:57.874
You mean Mona.

08:01.446 --> 08:03.380
If I tell you something,

08:03.414 --> 08:06.583
promise me
it doesn't leave this room.

08:06.617 --> 08:09.386
Emily, you can trust me
with your life.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.656
If you te <i>anyone,</i>
<i>it won't be safe.</i>

08:12.690 --> 08:15.425
There's nothing I wouldn't
do to protect you.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.595
It's not me I'm worried about.
It's you.

08:20.798 --> 08:22.833
Em, what is it?

08:25.536 --> 08:27.804
We think there's
somebody else helping Mona.

08:31.442 --> 08:33.443
Have you told the police?

08:33.477 --> 08:35.578
That night I came over,

08:35.613 --> 08:39.416
the night Ali's body
was taken, "A" set us up.

08:39.450 --> 08:41.451
They had a photo of us
at her grave,

08:41.486 --> 08:42.751
and we look guilty as hell.

08:42.787 --> 08:45.822
So your friends think it's me?

08:45.857 --> 08:48.625
That I'm this new "A"?

08:48.659 --> 08:50.827
That's what you were
arguing about this morning

08:50.862 --> 08:53.763
they'll figure it out.
They'll realize they're wrong.

08:53.798 --> 08:56.733
And in the meantime they'll do everything
they can to keep me away from you.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.768
I won't let that happen.

08:58.803 --> 09:00.904
( Cell phone rings )

09:07.678 --> 09:09.646
I have some family stuff
to take care of.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.815
But I'll see you Monday.

09:11.849 --> 09:15.585
And I'll go to the trial
every day.

09:15.620 --> 09:18.522
I promise
I won't leave your side.

09:27.498 --> 09:29.566
It's voice mail again.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.501
She <i>has</i> to be home.

09:31.536 --> 09:34.604
Maybe we should
just go over there.

09:34.639 --> 09:36.606
So things just went
from worse to worser.

09:36.641 --> 09:39.509
That's not a word.
But continue.

09:39.544 --> 09:44.381
Paige wasn't in Spanish today.
<i>Yo hablo sicko.</i>

09:44.415 --> 09:46.850
What?
She went home sick.

09:46.884 --> 09:48.718
Or is she at Emily's?

09:48.753 --> 09:50.754
I don't know about you two,

09:50.788 --> 09:53.523
but I'm <i>really</i> willing
to take this to the cops.

09:53.558 --> 09:56.793
No! I'm already
on their radar.

09:56.827 --> 10:00.463
For all I know, Paige smeared
my blood all over that anklet.

10:00.498 --> 10:01.698
Well, Emily might be
with Paige right now,

10:01.732 --> 10:03.600
and we all know what
she's capable of.

10:03.634 --> 10:05.535
I think we should
call her parents.

10:05.570 --> 10:08.572
We'll tell them everything. Together.
Spencer's right.

10:08.606 --> 10:09.873
There's strength in numbers.

10:14.679 --> 10:16.413
All right.

10:18.616 --> 10:20.750
( Cell phones ring )

10:24.722 --> 10:26.623
"Stand down, bitches.

10:26.657 --> 10:29.659

If we don't hear from Em
in the next hours

11:09.806 --> 11:12.298
I think we should revisit
the idea of telling her parents.

11:12.496 --> 11:13.396
I agree.

11:14.511 --> 11:16.125
This is probably Paige
just killing time

11:16.162 --> 11:19.403
so she can just find a way
to weasel herself out of this.

11:22.071 --> 11:24.873
Hanna. Hey.

11:24.907 --> 11:27.055
I'm just thinking about Emily.

11:27.074 --> 11:28.474
She finally gets over Maya,

11:28.508 --> 11:32.278
and now she's stuck with
some twisted psycho bitch.

11:32.312 --> 11:35.448
It's just another monster
that Alison created.

11:35.482 --> 11:39.285
She's been gone two years, and
we're still caught in her web.

11:39.319 --> 11:41.354
( Tablet beeps )

11:43.257 --> 11:45.124
It's from "A."

11:45.158 --> 11:47.026
"Let's settle this.

11:47.060 --> 11:49.362
Alison's grave. Ten P.M.
bring Maya's bag."

11:49.396 --> 11:51.397
There's an attachment.

11:53.467 --> 11:56.068
It's another picture
from that night.

11:58.171 --> 12:01.374
Paige can bring us down and leave
Emily completely in the clear.

12:01.408 --> 12:03.409
This must have been
her plan all along.

12:03.443 --> 12:06.212
Get rid of us, and then she
can have Emily all to herself.

12:06.246 --> 12:08.314
But she hasn't sent these
to the cops for a reason,

12:08.348 --> 12:11.384
and it's probably because there's
something in Maya's bag that she needs.

12:11.418 --> 12:13.219
Something that proves
that she killed her.

12:13.253 --> 12:16.355
No, we searched
every inch of that bag.

12:16.390 --> 12:18.157
You guys...

12:19.393 --> 12:21.227
Another picture.

12:21.261 --> 12:24.063
"Tell Emily and I'll leave you
holding the bag."

12:24.097 --> 12:26.098
Is that Ali?

12:26.133 --> 12:28.367
Oh, my God.

12:28.402 --> 12:30.369
( Door opens )

12:30.404 --> 12:32.305
What was that?

12:32.339 --> 12:34.407
What was that? Do you think
your mom's home early?

12:45.519 --> 12:47.119
Mom?

12:48.488 --> 12:51.223
There's somebody downstairs.

12:51.258 --> 12:53.326
Was it Paige?

13:03.070 --> 13:05.204
What are you doing here?!
I almost killed you!

13:05.238 --> 13:07.340
With a pink, furry lamp, Hanna?

13:07.374 --> 13:10.209
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be watching Emily's house.

13:10.243 --> 13:13.112
But there are, like, a dozen
reporters camped out on her lawn,

13:13.146 --> 13:15.214
her mom is home...
she's safe.

13:15.248 --> 13:17.216
We heard from Paige and Mona.

13:19.319 --> 13:23.122
You guys aren't
showing up there alone.

13:23.156 --> 13:26.058
( Cell phone rings )

13:26.093 --> 13:29.996
Hello.
Hanna: <i>Hi, em, it's me.</i>

13:30.030 --> 13:31.998
<i>Please don't hang up.</i>

13:32.032 --> 13:33.432
I want to make sure
you're okay.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.167
Spencer and I are in town,

13:35.202 --> 13:37.303
and there are
reporters everywhere.

13:37.337 --> 13:40.006
<i>So are you okay?</i>

13:40.040 --> 13:41.407
Nate's going out of town
this weekend.

13:41.441 --> 13:43.309
I'm going with him.

13:43.343 --> 13:45.111
That's great.
Where are you going?

13:45.145 --> 13:48.180
The lighthouse rock inn.
He found it online.

13:48.215 --> 13:50.149
Look, I know
it doesn't seem like it,

13:50.183 --> 13:52.485
but we are here for you, em.
<i>You're right.</i>

13:52.519 --> 13:54.520
It doesn't seem like it.

13:59.326 --> 14:01.994
They're three-deep
on the lawn out there.

14:02.029 --> 14:03.996
Yeah, I just got off
the phone with Hanna.

14:04.031 --> 14:06.232
She said that reporters
are all over town.

14:06.266 --> 14:09.969
I know you want to leave, but I really feel
like you need to be with family this weekend.

14:10.003 --> 14:12.405
I will be with family.
Maya's family.

14:12.439 --> 14:15.408
I told you, Nate's parents
are going to be there too.

14:15.442 --> 14:20.012
It's our way of celebrating Maya before
this whole thing becomes all about Garrett.

14:20.047 --> 14:22.048
And Nate's still just a friend?

14:22.082 --> 14:25.184
He wasn't at first,
but he is now.

14:25.218 --> 14:28.154
I really need a friend
this weekend.

14:32.192 --> 14:34.393
Are you sure you don't
want me to come?

14:34.428 --> 14:37.329
Don't worry.
He'll take good care of me.

14:41.268 --> 14:43.102
Hey.

14:43.136 --> 14:44.470
Call me when you get there?

14:44.504 --> 14:46.439
I will.

14:49.476 --> 14:52.278
Oh. Thanks, Angie.

14:52.312 --> 14:54.313
It actually makes me
feel a lot better

14:54.347 --> 14:56.382
knowing Emily's going to be
far away from here tonight.

14:56.416 --> 14:58.384
Yeah, me too.

14:58.418 --> 15:02.254
So I'll pick you up at nine.
Yeah, see you then.

15:18.271 --> 15:20.005
Toby?

15:33.053 --> 15:35.254
No, please, don't let me go.

15:38.158 --> 15:40.259
I'm so sorry for everything...

15:40.293 --> 15:42.128
for all the secrets.

15:42.162 --> 15:44.430
Spencer, I know who you are.

say you're sorry.

from next door.

16:51.031 --> 16:54.200
She locks herself out at least
once a week, so I keep a key.

16:54.234 --> 16:55.234
That's sweet.

16:55.268 --> 16:57.236
It's right by the door.

17:05.278 --> 17:07.112
Maggie?

17:08.448 --> 17:12.218
It sounds like a cliche,
but I was in the neighborhood.

17:14.387 --> 17:16.188
Well, please come... come in.

17:20.260 --> 17:24.163
M-Maggie, this is...

17:24.196 --> 17:26.131
My girlfriend, Aria.

17:26.165 --> 17:28.334
Ezra, there's something
that I need to tell you.

17:28.367 --> 17:32.004
It's really nice
to meet you... Aria.

17:36.663 --> 17:39.503
Um... picking up assignments
here and there.

17:39.909 --> 17:43.178
Uh... seems like things are really
starting to come together..

17:43.213 --> 17:45.814
I think it's terrific
that you're writing.

17:45.849 --> 17:47.983
But why did you
give up teaching?

17:48.018 --> 17:50.819
Uh, it's complicated.

17:50.854 --> 17:52.888
( Knock on door )

17:52.922 --> 17:55.758
That has <i>got</i> to be
Mrs. Rosenthal.

18:01.097 --> 18:03.832
You know the truth.
Why haven't you told him?

18:03.867 --> 18:06.902
That's not something
you spring on someone.

18:06.936 --> 18:08.704
What are you doing here?

18:08.738 --> 18:12.641
I was curious. He's
the father of my son.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.777
Yeah, he deserves to know that.

18:14.811 --> 18:17.846
Did you come here to tell him?
Maybe.

18:17.881 --> 18:19.782
I... I'm not sure.

18:19.816 --> 18:21.717
Look, I've been through a lot.

18:21.751 --> 18:24.720
I need some time
to sort this all out.

18:24.754 --> 18:26.722
I've earned it, okay?
No.

18:26.756 --> 18:28.991
No, it's not okay.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.993
If he figures out
that I'm lying to him...

18:31.027 --> 18:34.830
he won't figure it out.
I promise. Please.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.999
Ezra: Well...

18:37.033 --> 18:39.134
There we go.

18:41.104 --> 18:43.706
Wait. So what
you're asking me to do...

18:43.740 --> 18:45.874
there's more to this story
than you know.

18:45.909 --> 18:50.746
For Malcolm's sake, I need to
figure out what's best for him.

18:52.115 --> 18:56.985
I'm not the only one here
with a secret... Amy.

18:57.020 --> 19:00.155
( Door closes )
Ezra: Can't remember her keys,

19:00.190 --> 19:03.092
yet she never forgets dessert.

19:05.762 --> 19:06.895
Is everything okay?

19:08.031 --> 19:10.065
Yeah.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.935
I'll get plates for this.

19:15.772 --> 19:17.139
Thank you.

19:26.983 --> 19:28.984
Hey. I thought you
were taking a shower.

19:30.787 --> 19:32.921
Is that a gun?

19:34.724 --> 19:36.759
Where did you get that?

19:36.793 --> 19:39.061
You know what, I don't want to know.
Just get rid of it.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.030
Hanna, this "A"
almost killed my mom.

19:42.065 --> 19:45.100
Okay? I'm not letting you go to that
cemetery without some kind of protection.

19:45.135 --> 19:46.835
Well, if you plan
to bring that gun,

19:46.903 --> 19:48.003
then you can forget
about coming tonight.

19:48.037 --> 19:50.005
It's not just your call, Hanna.

19:50.039 --> 19:51.940
Is it loaded?

19:51.975 --> 19:53.776
Listen to me, okay?

19:53.810 --> 19:56.011
Caleb, I swear to God,
get rid of that thing now

19:56.045 --> 19:58.947
or don't let the door hit you
in the ass in the way out.

19:58.982 --> 20:00.115
All <i>right.</i>

20:00.150 --> 20:02.084
I hear you.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.963
It'll stay there until Monday
and then I'll get rid of it.

20:14.998 --> 20:16.965
Are you good with that?

20:18.902 --> 20:22.971
Hey.
It's gonna be okay.

20:23.006 --> 20:25.207
I promise.

20:25.241 --> 20:28.210
It just feels too easy...

20:28.244 --> 20:32.147
Paige and Mona
giving up like this.

20:32.182 --> 20:35.050
We're gonna put an end
to this tonight.

20:35.084 --> 20:37.786
Now, remember,

Caleb, I think that you should
take Maya's bag with you.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.762

Maybe Paige sent us here

29:01.950 --> 29:03.885
<i>We'll call you later.</i>

29:06.221 --> 29:08.789
We're going to Bayhead.

29:08.824 --> 29:10.925
( Steam hissing )

29:20.802 --> 29:22.837
I brought some DVDs.

29:22.871 --> 29:25.173
I thought we might
watch a movie later.

29:25.207 --> 29:28.209
I'm not, um,
really feeling that great.

29:28.243 --> 29:30.044
I think I'm gonna get
some fresh air.

29:30.078 --> 29:32.013
I'll go with you.

29:32.047 --> 29:34.081
It's really dark out.

29:34.116 --> 29:35.883
( Distant foghorn )

29:35.918 --> 29:37.919
I'll find my way.

29:46.895 --> 29:48.229
You better wear your jacket.

29:48.263 --> 29:50.264
It's cold out there.

30:10.819 --> 30:12.019
( Gasps )

30:12.054 --> 30:15.823
Oh, my God. You scared
me half to death.

30:15.857 --> 30:19.227
Not really...
But I will.

30:24.403 --> 30:26.809
Maya:
I have wanted to give you this in person,

30:26.929 --> 30:29.898
<i>because I want to be there</i>
<i>when you watch it.</i>

30:29.932 --> 30:33.101
<i>I've said so many</i>
<i>wrong things to you.</i>

30:33.135 --> 30:36.638
<i>Emily, this is me taking
the time to get it right.</i>

30:36.672 --> 30:38.940
<i>I've been staying</i>
<i>at Noel Kahn's cabin</i>

30:38.975 --> 30:42.911
<i>trying to figure a way out of</i>
<i>the mess that I got myself into</i>

30:42.945 --> 30:45.080
<i>and I'm not totally sure,</i>

30:45.114 --> 30:47.716
<i>but I think that stalker</i>
<i>from tru north found me,</i>

30:47.750 --> 30:51.086
<i>I thought I saw him</i>
<i>at a party the other night.</i>

30:51.120 --> 30:53.989
<i>This isn't about him,</i>
<i>it's about us.</i>

30:55.791 --> 30:58.960
<i>I'm coming home, and...</i>

30:58.995 --> 31:00.962
<i>If you still</i>
<i>want to be with me,</i>

31:00.997 --> 31:04.666
<i>if I can still count on us,</i>

31:04.700 --> 31:06.735
<i>I know I can get through this.</i>

31:08.871 --> 31:11.773
How could you not
fall in love with her smile?

31:11.807 --> 31:14.809
Why do you have this?
I think you know the answer.

31:18.014 --> 31:21.650
What you don't know...

31:21.684 --> 31:23.918
Is how much I loved her.

31:25.021 --> 31:26.888
Don't look at me like that.

31:26.922 --> 31:30.692
<i>Said,</i> don't look
at me like that!

31:31.861 --> 31:35.096
When I found you at the brew,

31:35.131 --> 31:38.099
hearing you talk about Maya...

31:38.167 --> 31:41.002
I felt so connected to her.

31:41.037 --> 31:42.837
It's ironic.

31:42.872 --> 31:45.106
You took her from me,

31:45.174 --> 31:47.876
and then you gave me
a little bit of her back.

31:47.910 --> 31:51.680
Did you bring me here
to kill me too?

31:51.714 --> 31:54.983
I'm gonna do to you
what you did to me.

31:55.017 --> 31:57.085
I'm gonna take
something from you,

31:57.119 --> 31:59.888
and you are gonna
watch me do it.

32:13.035 --> 32:15.737
( Whimpering )

32:20.109 --> 32:22.977
You're gonna make a right
at the intersection.

32:23.012 --> 32:25.046
How far away are you
from Belmar?

32:25.081 --> 32:27.749
I'm not sure.
A couple of miles, maybe.

32:27.783 --> 32:29.984
Can you just promise me
that you'll be careful?

32:30.019 --> 32:32.887
<i>I promise.</i>
<i>There it is on the hill.</i>

32:32.922 --> 32:36.725
Hanna... I love you.

32:36.759 --> 32:39.994
I love you too, Caleb.

32:52.775 --> 32:55.043
When we kissed,

32:55.077 --> 32:58.813
I thought, "maybe I don't
have to hurt her.

32:58.848 --> 33:01.950
Maybe I can move on
with Emily."

33:01.984 --> 33:06.621
But just like Maya, you were playing me.
That's not true.

33:06.655 --> 33:09.791
I gave you a choice.
You picked her.

33:26.842 --> 33:29.144
( Whimpering loudly )

33:52.902 --> 33:55.937
Looks like
this place is closed.

33:55.971 --> 33:57.806
Spencer: Wait. No.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.774
There's a light on
in that cabin.

34:12.655 --> 34:13.888
I want you to see this.

34:15.958 --> 34:17.792
No. No!

34:18.860 --> 34:20.862
My friends know I'm here.

34:20.896 --> 34:23.731
My mom knows.
They'll find you.

34:23.766 --> 34:25.867
You underestimate me, Emily.

34:25.900 --> 34:28.069
I have been planning this
for months.

34:28.103 --> 34:31.105
They think you're here
with Nate St. Germaine.

34:31.139 --> 34:33.808
And he doesn't exist.

34:35.978 --> 34:38.112
Who are you? Really?

34:38.147 --> 34:40.047
Lyndon.

34:40.081 --> 34:41.916
I'm Lyndon James.

34:41.918 --> 34:44.953
Lyndon, you don't
have to do this.

34:44.987 --> 34:47.922
You can leave. You can walk away.
I won't tell anybody.

34:47.956 --> 34:50.091
I've waited as long as I could.

34:50.125 --> 34:53.027
But I think Jenna
saw me with Maya.

34:53.062 --> 34:57.832
And now with her parents in town
for the trial... Time's up.

35:11.647 --> 35:12.914
( Footsteps outside )

35:24.660 --> 35:26.661
Damn it.

35:36.939 --> 35:38.039
Em!

35:50.986 --> 35:53.888
There's no one here.
I'm calling Caleb.

36:23.886 --> 36:25.620
Oh, come on.

36:25.654 --> 36:27.088
Come on, come on.

36:42.738 --> 36:44.939
Come on. Come on!

36:52.815 --> 36:56.618
Operator:
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

36:56.652 --> 36:58.686
<i>Hello?</i>

36:58.721 --> 37:00.054
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>No!</i>

37:03.792 --> 37:05.893
( Shouting )

37:36.825 --> 37:39.060
( Slicing sound )

37:48.070 --> 37:50.972
Caleb: Emily! Emily.

37:51.006 --> 37:53.741
Emily.
( Sobbing )

37:54.743 --> 37:56.678
Emily.

38:05.921 --> 38:07.655
Come here.

38:09.892 --> 38:11.025
It's okay.

38:18.033 --> 38:19.967
( Gunshot )

38:27.940 --> 38:30.436
Caleb! No!!!

38:34.716 --> 38:35.716
Caleb!!!

38:45.482 --> 38:47.416
( Siren wailing )

38:52.355 --> 38:55.491
( Hanna sobbing )

39:08.205 --> 39:11.273
So, the deceased
was a friend of yours?

39:17.013 --> 39:20.082
Miss Fields, please. I'm trying
to understand what happened here.

39:20.116 --> 39:24.220
When I was with Emily yesterday,
I got an anonymous text.

39:24.254 --> 39:28.290
Ten P.M. Saturday, Rosewood
cemetery, or Emily gets hurt.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.059
Did you know the victim?

39:30.093 --> 39:32.027
Yes.

39:32.062 --> 39:33.996
Was he a friend of yours?

39:34.030 --> 39:36.265
He got me before I got there.

39:41.471 --> 39:43.973
I can't do this right now.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.242
Please just let me
talk to my friend.

39:47.976 --> 39:49.445
Officers.

39:53.416 --> 39:55.117
Oh, Han,

39:55.151 --> 39:57.253
I'm so sorry!

39:58.388 --> 40:01.056
( Sobbing )

40:19.409 --> 40:20.442
Han.

40:29.386 --> 40:31.186
Caleb's still in surgery.

40:33.356 --> 40:35.424
How ya holdin' up?

40:35.458 --> 40:37.359
I'm fine.

40:37.394 --> 40:42.398
P.A.: <i>Pam Fields, please pick
up the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

40:42.432 --> 40:44.400
Must be dad.

40:44.434 --> 40:48.070
No, I never reached him. He
doesn't even know we're here.

40:54.277 --> 40:56.445
( Cell phones ring )

41:06.124 --> 41:10.392
Distorted voice: <i>Emily, I owe you one.
( Lines disconnects )</i>

41:14.064 --> 41:16.365
That was odd.
There was no one there.

41:23.206 --> 41:24.406
( No audible dialogue )

41:30.146 --> 41:32.181
Garrett:
I'm here to see my mother.

41:32.215 --> 41:35.150
Mom, he's out of jail?

41:35.185 --> 41:38.087
Emily, I'm so sorry you had
to go through that tonight.

41:38.121 --> 41:41.156
But I want you know that
you helped an innocent victim.

41:41.191 --> 41:44.293
Because of you, Garrett
Reynolds is a free man.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.376
If I knew Nate was
gonna get Garrett out,

42:00.410 --> 42:03.245
I would have stayed in tonight.

42:03.279 --> 42:05.314
You have to get
Maya's cell phone back.

42:05.348 --> 42:07.316
That shouldn't be
too difficult...

42:07.350 --> 42:10.986
Paige doesn't even
know she has it.

42:11.020 --> 42:15.958
(Sighs) It sucks we didn't
get to make that phone call.

42:15.992 --> 42:19.261
Ring ring. "What's Paige doing
with Maya's cell phone?

42:19.295 --> 42:23.265
O-M-G. She must
be the killer."

42:23.299 --> 42:27.436
Oh, well, even the best
laid plans go awry.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.113
( Beep )

42:40.150 --> 42:42.117
I'll see you soon.

43:24.070 --> 43:28.030
Toby (Distorted): <i>I'll take two
tickets for the Halloween train.</i>
