00:16.239 --> 00:20.240
- Are you blaming your mum?
- Yes, yes, I am.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.910
She was increasingly out of sorts.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.550
Ultimately, she...

00:26.600 --> 00:30.190
.. and rather inconveniently,
attempted suicide.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.350
I thought you said it was a light bulb.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.630
Well, that's what we decided to say
to people outside of our family

00:36.680 --> 00:38.430
and close friends.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.480
She did fall but she fell in
the process of attempting to...

00:44.280 --> 00:47.310
But she's dead now and all the...

00:47.360 --> 00:49.950
is definitely out of my mind.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.630
So, bad for her, but good
for us, and good for Grubbs.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.750
And, as soon as I get home, I'm
going to be getting down to it

00:55.800 --> 00:58.790
with renewed vigour, and the
words are just going to be...

00:58.840 --> 01:02.840
flowing, flowing out, like...

01:03.760 --> 01:07.070
- .. something.
- We'll think about it.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.950
OK, thank you, Carol.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
And thank you, Carroll.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.350
Yes, she fell over changing
a light bulb, poor thing.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.750
- Just one of the hazards
of old age, I guess. - Yeah.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.430
Are you sure Mrs Beckett's
all right with you being here?

01:40.480 --> 01:42.520
- Did he not tell you?
- Yeah, Barry took a week off

01:42.560 --> 01:45.230
cos of the cheese burns, so
we fell behind with the wall.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.710
She basically fired us.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.390
Well, no wonder he was so keen to help.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.030
- He's always wanted to
work for you. - Has he?

01:52.080 --> 01:53.710
To put it mildly.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.990
Mind out.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.950
Nice!

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Take that, you bigoted miserly...

02:05.640 --> 02:09.639
chicken killing hog-mistress!

02:12.160 --> 02:16.160
I am working for an angel now!

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
- That's it, Tommy, bit of welly.
- Is the angle oblique enough?

02:28.240 --> 02:30.790
I don't know what you're
talking about, mate.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.470
Whoa! There's a fucking
hedge! What are you doing?

02:33.520 --> 02:34.910
Get out of the way, then.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.270
Who taught you to drive? What was that?

02:37.320 --> 02:40.590
- What's going on?
- All right?

02:40.640 --> 02:42.350
I thought we were just doing Mum's room.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.990
I thought we'd have a proper
clear-out, while we're at it.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.230
- Well, what are these guys
doing here? - Surprise!

02:47.280 --> 02:48.790
They work for us now.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.550
Look, I just want to make this a
nice home again, for Nana's sake.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.600
Well... OK. I have to talk
to you about that actually.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.270
- Why, did the meeting go badly?
- Yeah, but that's not...

03:00.320 --> 03:02.870
- Well, it's partly...
- Slow down, Maurice.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.870
Look, I know this is a hard time for you.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.830
It's an awful thing to have happened,

03:06.880 --> 03:10.870
and I feel awful, too, but
at least I'm dealing with it.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.920
Look, come with me, I want to
show you something. Nice smile.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.360
So, Barry and the boys have made
this lovely vegetable sanctuary.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.630
And I've got us some
seeds to sow together,

03:26.680 --> 03:30.680
like a little ceremony for Nana.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.310
And part of the surprise

03:33.360 --> 03:37.360
is I thought why can't Nana
be involved, too? So...

03:37.520 --> 03:41.520
I've divided her into four.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.950
And, that way, she can be
with us together forever.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.270
And after everything she went
through, she can come back

03:49.320 --> 03:52.430
as some nice cauliflowers
and strawberries, and so on.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.480
I'm not sure eating my own mother
is quite my idea of a fond farewell.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.750
Are there green beans?

03:58.800 --> 04:02.800
I'm trying to find a way for us all
to face this tragedy for what it is.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.630
And to turn it into something good.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.670
Why do you keep telling everyone
the story about a light bulb, then?

04:07.720 --> 04:10.710
Because, Amy, the truth is
sometimes like a toothbrush.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.630
And you only share that
with people you really trust.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.870
- I wouldn't share my toothbrush with
any of you. - You would in a war.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.920
- Shall we just get on with this?
- Thank you. So, ready?

04:28.120 --> 04:30.390
Fucking hell, mate.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.390
- Mrs Flowers!
- Can it wait, Shun?

04:33.440 --> 04:37.270
- Telephone call from your sister.
- Thank you.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.870
And what about these? You
don't need five dictionaries.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.590
- Well, they're all
slightly different. - Oh.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.790
Look.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.510
Do you remember?

04:48.560 --> 04:52.560
- So romantic. - Deborah, can I
have a few minutes to explain...

04:55.080 --> 04:56.550
Oh.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.830
Viv. I thought she was coming later.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.710
Did you say she could come, then?

05:00.760 --> 05:04.510
I know it's not the best time,
but... she's just split up with PJ,

05:04.560 --> 05:08.560
I thought she could do with some support.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.590
- I'm free!
- Yay!

05:12.640 --> 05:15.950
- What a relief.
- You must feel a little shaken, at least.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.950
God, no. I feel amazing. The
alarm bells were going berserk.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
- No more shackles for me,
thank you, PJ. - Hi, Viv.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.920
Why are you standing over
there holding those books?

05:30.880 --> 05:34.310
Suitcase.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.360
- You look... trimmer every
time I see you, Donald. - Thanks.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.280
- I have been doing 100 bendy-bums
every morning. - Very good.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.070
Viv! >

05:55.120 --> 05:57.910
Viv! >

05:57.960 --> 06:01.110
- Where have you gone? >
- I didn't know you listen to music.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.910
No, that's the sound of
machinery. It helps me sleep.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.110
Maybe we should listen
to it together later.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.950
Viv, leave Donald alone
to clear out his lab.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
All right, chill out, Mum!

06:13.080 --> 06:15.230
'So, she's still not moved out, then.'

06:15.280 --> 06:17.870
They have both mentioned that
they might. Just after Nana,

06:17.920 --> 06:20.590
they perhaps need a bit of time
to build themselves up again.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.640
- Not still breast-feeding
them as well, I hope. - No.

06:25.400 --> 06:29.400
- Ah, the niece who shat on my leg.
- Are we still going on about that?

06:29.720 --> 06:30.910
She was only four.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.990
That's a nice pile of soiled
knickers you have there, Amy.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.270
- Yeah, it was from my art coursework
about periods. - So creative.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.670
Perhaps something for the
fire now, though, eh?

06:39.720 --> 06:42.590
I got an A for it, so I thought
I might keep it, actually.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.550
You know what I'm going
to ask you, don't you?

06:44.600 --> 06:46.920
- Do I have a boyfriend yet?
- Do you have a boyfriend yet?

06:46.960 --> 06:48.950
Yeah, you already asked
me that at the funeral.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.190
You'd better get on with it,

06:50.240 --> 06:52.110
you don't want to end
up like Debs, do you?

06:52.160 --> 06:55.710
Well, as long as you're not lonely
and desperate like Viv is now.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.830
Well, you tell me, Amy.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.310
Would you settle for sleeping with
just your father for three decades?

07:01.360 --> 07:04.110
The phrasing makes it quite
hard to answer that question.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.470
- She's just jealous I found myself
such a catch. - Catch-22, more like.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.990
On the one hand, he's boring.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.590
On the other hand, he
smells like an old tramp.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.750
- That's not what a Catch-22 is.
- The clock ticks, Amy.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.510
That's why I had to
relinquish myself so young

07:17.560 --> 07:19.630
to a boy called Jake HARD.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.550
Oh, well, he's in prison now. Not
such a great choice, Auntie Viv.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.710
Nun.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.230
Slut.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.390
No, I think all of this has to go, Shun.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.110
Mrs Flowers, this will all take a
very long time for me. Precious.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.030
Yes, I know, but we're trying to
create a nice, healthy environment,

07:40.080 --> 07:42.030
and a lot of this work
is a little bit poisonous.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.830
- How about if maybe keep just half?
- Which half?

07:44.880 --> 07:48.880
- Can you help me, please, Maurice?
- Or maybe keep this one? - What is it?

07:49.800 --> 07:53.670
- Kancho Pig. - And what does "kancho"
mean? - Kancho is a special move.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.110
- Sticking finger in bottom.
- No, Shun, that's got to go.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.510
You see, I want things
like this on the fire. OK?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.960
OK, Mrs Flowers, no problem.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.630
Are he and "Shaun" still
sharing that... weird cabin?

08:08.680 --> 08:11.470
Well, that's where they work. Why?

08:11.520 --> 08:13.790
Oh, nothing, nothing. It's just that...

08:13.840 --> 08:16.390
He's in there a lot, isn't he?

08:16.440 --> 08:19.310
And Maurice is under quite a
lot of pressure at the moment.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.270
- Maurice, come and have a break!
- Just dealing with Shun.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.320
- Viv has brought some Swiss roll.
You love Swiss roll. - Do I?

08:26.680 --> 08:29.030
God, he's obsessed with him.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.080
- Deborah, I'm afraid you've
got a visitor. - Oh, George.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.789
I can't keep you away.
Look, Maurice, it's George.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.870
What can I say? I am an iron filing

08:37.919 --> 08:40.590
quivering in your powerful magnetic field.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.669
Well, I'm here to offer
myself up for some free mirth

08:43.720 --> 08:45.790
and a cuddle, if you're not too busy.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.070
Barold tells me you're
having a bit of a clear out.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.910
I'm called Barry. Barold's not a name.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.960
And who, may I ask, in the name of
Aphrodite, goddess of sex, is this?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.670
It's my older sister.

08:57.720 --> 09:01.110
This is the problem being a
plastic surgeon in Heathen's Wood.

09:01.160 --> 09:05.750
All the women are stunning already.
I might have to move to Ugly Town.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.150
Not that I couldn't make
you even more pristine.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.430
- I'm like Picasso... - Picasso? - ..
But with a scalpel instead of a brush.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.480
- Vivian, pleasure to meet you.
- Let's hope it will be...

09:16.240 --> 09:17.630
.. a pleasure.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.680
I must say, you look very
beautiful when you're sad, Deborah.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.550
- Always been a little bit
sad, haven't you? - No.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.910
Maybe that's why she
always looks beautiful.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.960
You're a creepy so-and-so, aren't you?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.510
- Hello.
- Abigail.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.710
What are you doing here?
Thought you had some work to do.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.630
I changed my mind. Thought I'd
come and say hello as well.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.910
Is Amy in?

09:42.960 --> 09:46.960
Yeah, she's upstairs.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.630
Kablamo!

09:51.680 --> 09:55.680
Abigail, the stallion won again
and the mares are very impressed.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.990
What happened, Maurice? You're
normally very good at cards.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.030
- You can't actually be good at cards.
- It's all in the mind, of course.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.150
Well, it's all in the cards, actually.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.390
I once saw a man miss 50 grand flush

10:06.440 --> 10:09.510
because he was too busy wallowing
in toxic thoughts about his debts.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.750
If he just flicked that
switch in his head,

10:11.800 --> 10:14.310
he could have turned his
life around. But, instead,

10:14.360 --> 10:18.360
- he left empty-handed, and wanked
himself to death in a basement. - No!

10:18.480 --> 10:21.670
Three months hiding in
shame from his family.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.720
Just withered away in a flood of
his own excrement and discharge.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.030
How did you know this person?

10:29.080 --> 10:31.950
Did you look at his hand
over his shoulder in a casino

10:32.000 --> 10:34.470
and then follow him to a
basement in his own house

10:34.520 --> 10:37.070
where, apparently, his family
didn't even know he was there

10:37.120 --> 10:40.510
for three months, even though
he was masturbating constantly?

10:42.560 --> 10:45.670
This is why it's taking you so
long to finish your book, Maurice.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.430
You get bogged down in the details.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.830
Are the slug people not
treating you very well, Maurice?

10:49.880 --> 10:52.070
They're more like goblins,
actually, aren't they?

10:52.120 --> 10:55.150
The barricade in your head is
an illusion, created by you.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.510
It's a question of
maintenance. You are a car.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.990
- I'm not a car. - You need the
right tyres, the right fuel.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.110
I don't need tyres cos I'm not a car.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.790
What are you eating at the moment?

11:03.840 --> 11:06.230
You want me to list everything I'm eating?

11:06.280 --> 11:09.280
Maurice thinks potatoes are a vegetable.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.520
They are a vegetable.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.390
Hey, Fat Matilda. Thanks for
coming at such short notice.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.630
- Hi, how are you doing?
- I need a wing man.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.590
What? I thought you
just wanted to hang out.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.470
It was just a ruse to
make sure you'd come.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.870
My hot neighbour's here. Quick!

11:27.920 --> 11:31.920
Sorry, this is... just some art.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.750
Penny's Passage.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.800
Yeah, it's not finished.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.110
Are you...

11:52.160 --> 11:54.670
a feminist?

11:54.720 --> 11:57.550
Er...

11:57.600 --> 12:00.630
Maybe. Yeah.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.830
Are you a... feminist?

12:02.880 --> 12:06.880
Maybe.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.710
You look like a feminist.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.270
Do I?

12:11.320 --> 12:14.710
Yeah.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.760
Well, maybe you make me feel...

12:19.760 --> 12:23.760
.. a bit like a feminist.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.840
Do I?

12:29.880 --> 12:31.350
So hard to be a feminist

12:31.400 --> 12:35.400
- when you still live with
your parents, isn't it? - Yeah.

12:37.520 --> 12:41.520
Do you... want to go to a place
together, sometime, like, if we...

12:43.520 --> 12:47.520
- .. arranged it? - Do you mean do
I want to go on a date? Like a...

12:48.240 --> 12:52.070
.. feminist date?

12:52.120 --> 12:53.550
Maybe.

12:59.356 --> 13:02.586
- I think she's coming.
- Quick, put your hand on my chest.

13:02.636 --> 13:04.026
What?

13:04.076 --> 13:05.746
Put your hand on my chest and laugh.

13:05.796 --> 13:08.666
Isn't that going to seem really weird?

13:14.036 --> 13:16.266
Nostrovia.

13:21.956 --> 13:23.426
Oh, I know you still love me,

13:23.476 --> 13:26.426
Matilda, but you're going to have
to find someone in your own league.

13:26.476 --> 13:30.676
- I just made this... - For fuck's sake. - .. jet-powered
skate booter for crying out loud. - Hey, Matilda.

13:30.716 --> 13:32.626
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good. What are you doing?

13:32.676 --> 13:35.386
- I think he's trying to make you
jealous or something. - What?! No!

13:35.436 --> 13:37.986
She just turned up again
like some kind of stalker!

13:38.036 --> 13:39.226
As if.

13:39.276 --> 13:43.276
- You guys are cute.
- No!

13:43.756 --> 13:45.866
I might go home as well, to be honest.

13:45.916 --> 13:47.506
Well, there's not much point in me

13:47.556 --> 13:51.556
being here if you're just going
to be weird about it, is there?

13:51.756 --> 13:55.756
Mr Grubb... sat in a chair...

13:57.236 --> 14:00.266
.. trying to eat a pear...

14:00.316 --> 14:04.316
.. with a Dung-Dodo.

14:08.956 --> 14:12.506
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

14:12.556 --> 14:16.556
- Are you OK? - Yup, fine.
Just trying to do some work.

14:17.316 --> 14:21.316
- Erm, would you mind reading
something for me? - Oh, OK, sure.

14:24.876 --> 14:26.546
Now?

14:38.996 --> 14:40.386
Mm-hm.

14:40.436 --> 14:44.436
Hmm...

14:44.556 --> 14:48.556
So it's a sort of fictionalised
narrative or a sort of...?

14:49.556 --> 14:52.186
No, it's for someone.

14:52.236 --> 14:56.236
Oh, I see. Well, often,
this sort of poetry...

14:56.556 --> 14:58.106
it can be quite heavy-handed.

14:58.156 --> 15:00.866
Lots of overt phallic imagery, you know,

15:00.916 --> 15:03.146
but I like how this is
more abstract and...

15:03.196 --> 15:07.196
It's for a girl.

15:08.076 --> 15:10.986
So... this is, erm...

15:11.036 --> 15:13.626
a...

15:13.676 --> 15:15.466
- .. vagina?
- Yep.

15:15.516 --> 15:19.516
- Hmm.
- I guess. Or a mouth.

15:20.116 --> 15:22.866
Course it is. Yeah, of
course it is. Erm...

15:22.916 --> 15:25.426
Well, that's, er, fantastic.

15:25.476 --> 15:28.466
Congratulations on... Heh-heh.

15:28.516 --> 15:30.466
And well done.

15:30.516 --> 15:32.266
I...

15:32.316 --> 15:34.306
I can really hear your music in it.

15:34.356 --> 15:37.106
- Bold, heroic...
- Thanks, Dad.

15:37.156 --> 15:40.426
And I am your dad so I love... I love...

15:40.476 --> 15:44.476
I love hearing... about your life, erm...

15:49.316 --> 15:52.866
Erm, I thought I might wait before
telling Mum, just because...

15:52.916 --> 15:55.066
Yeah, you trust me more, or...?

15:55.116 --> 15:59.116
Well, no, erm, just because I
don't want it to be a thing.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.866
- Cool.
- Cool.

16:25.916 --> 16:29.916
Actually, Amy...

16:30.236 --> 16:32.666
Erm, I...

16:32.716 --> 16:34.506
Er...

16:34.556 --> 16:36.506
I would say that you should try

16:36.556 --> 16:40.556
and iron out some of those
mixed metaphors, if you can.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.106
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodnight.

16:48.996 --> 16:51.706
I hope they have sturdy springs.

16:58.236 --> 17:00.066
I feel stupid.

17:00.116 --> 17:04.116
I think maybe it's reached a
point now where it's just easier

17:04.195 --> 17:08.195
not to tell any of them.

17:08.435 --> 17:12.026
What should I do, Shun?

17:12.076 --> 17:15.066
Life is like toilet, Mr Flowers.

17:15.116 --> 17:18.306
Sometimes you have so much
rubbish in your stomach,

17:18.356 --> 17:21.066
you have a gigantic poo.

17:21.116 --> 17:23.906
So huge, of course, blocking toilet.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.266
Big panic.

17:25.316 --> 17:29.316
You trying flush. Poking with
coat hanger. Use your finger.

17:30.076 --> 17:34.076
Too embarrassed ask for help.
"My gosh, what shall I do?"

17:34.156 --> 17:35.186
Hmm.

17:35.236 --> 17:39.236
But tell truth, Mr Flowers. No
problem if you ask for help.

17:41.156 --> 17:45.106
"Excuse me, I am have gigantic poo."

17:45.156 --> 17:49.146
"Somebody please help
for unblock my toilet."

17:49.196 --> 17:53.196
"Of course. My gosh, so
smelly, everybody terrified."

17:53.396 --> 17:57.396
Such a gigantic poo. So ashame.

17:59.076 --> 18:02.906
But help for flush is coming.

18:02.956 --> 18:06.956
Very clean for start again.

18:07.436 --> 18:11.436
Thank you, Shun. You're a good friend.

18:13.916 --> 18:17.916
- You can do it, Mr Flowers.
- OK.

18:18.836 --> 18:22.026
Yeah.

18:40.876 --> 18:44.876
- Oh! - Sorry, I didn't know whether
you were awake or... Knock-knock.

18:45.836 --> 18:49.106
- You don't need to knock. It's your room.
- You look nice.

18:49.156 --> 18:51.346
Erm... Are you planning something?

18:51.396 --> 18:54.906
Erm, well, it's for you, actually.

18:54.956 --> 18:56.626
I was going to ask if, perhaps,

18:56.676 --> 18:58.946
you wanted to sleep in
here with me tonight.

18:58.996 --> 19:01.186
Yeah. Maybe.

19:01.236 --> 19:03.826
But first, could I...?

19:03.876 --> 19:07.666
- First you what?
- No, I do want to, I just, erm...

19:07.716 --> 19:09.586
Could I... could I just...

19:09.636 --> 19:11.786
We haven't slept in the
same bed for months.

19:11.836 --> 19:15.466
Yeah, but that's not because I...

19:16.836 --> 19:18.306
Sorry, I'm just having trouble...

19:18.356 --> 19:22.266
It just seems like you don't want to.

19:22.316 --> 19:25.186
Well, maybe that's because, erm...

19:25.236 --> 19:26.706
Look, what I've been trying to...

19:26.756 --> 19:30.756
Ugh, I wish they would
stop fucking so loud!

19:31.316 --> 19:33.946
Shut up.

19:33.996 --> 19:37.996
Erm... Look, I'm...

19:39.156 --> 19:43.156
I was coming to talk to you about...

19:44.396 --> 19:47.626
Erm...

19:49.556 --> 19:52.746
Erm... the milk.

19:52.796 --> 19:54.986
- The milk?
- Yeah.

19:55.036 --> 19:57.666
Erm... I just suddenly
thought, for the morning,

19:57.716 --> 20:00.066
- since we've got guests...
- What do you mean?

20:00.116 --> 20:04.116
Do you think we have enough
milk or should I go and get some?

20:04.236 --> 20:06.836
I think it's the middle of the
night and we should just go to bed.

20:06.876 --> 20:09.546
Yeah, er, I'm actually not sleeping.

20:09.596 --> 20:13.506
I could maybe benefit from a
trip down the road just to...

20:13.556 --> 20:16.156
Does it matter if it's full fat?

20:16.836 --> 20:18.906
Maybe I'll just see what they've got.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.186
- OK, goodnight.
- Night.

20:21.236 --> 20:24.436
- OK. Right. Bye. See
ya. - See ya. - Bye.

20:29.076 --> 20:31.466
Mr Flowers.

20:31.516 --> 20:33.946
Disaster.

20:33.996 --> 20:37.996
I couldn't do it.

20:44.916 --> 20:47.226
- What?
- Sorry.

20:47.276 --> 20:50.546
Could I bum a couple of fags off Maurice?

20:50.596 --> 20:52.106
I'm gasping.

20:52.156 --> 20:54.266
He's gone to get some milk.

20:54.316 --> 20:55.666
Please.

20:55.716 --> 20:59.226
I'll try and catch him.

20:59.276 --> 21:01.866
Super stint for Mr Flowers.

21:01.916 --> 21:04.586
Tell you the truth, this
will be piece of cake.

21:04.636 --> 21:06.506
- Oh. - Big one's coming. - Yeah.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.986
- OK. - OK. - Urgh.

21:08.036 --> 21:11.346
Oh!

21:11.396 --> 21:13.426
- Oh!
- Keep going.

21:15.306 --> 21:16.306
Oh, my God.

21:16.356 --> 21:18.466
- Ready? - Erm, yeah. - OK.

21:18.516 --> 21:20.066
Did you study this in Japan?

21:20.116 --> 21:22.116
- Not really.
- Oh.

21:22.756 --> 21:25.026
Maurice. Viv wants some cigarettes.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.626
- Oh. - Yep. - OK.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.026
That's enough pounding of the buttocks.

21:29.076 --> 21:31.026
Hello, Shun.

21:31.076 --> 21:32.266
What were you doing?

21:32.316 --> 21:34.666
I thought you went out to get some milk.

21:34.716 --> 21:36.746
Erm, I just felt a bit stressed, so...

21:36.796 --> 21:38.026
Bottom massage.

21:38.076 --> 21:40.026
So, cigarettes, Viv. Where are they?

21:40.076 --> 21:41.106
Ah, look, here they are.

21:41.156 --> 21:43.706
Right, enjoy your evening,
everybody. Goodnight.

21:43.756 --> 21:46.586
Well, if you're not
going to say it, I will.

21:46.636 --> 21:50.636
Maurice is definitely
milking the Japanese.

21:50.796 --> 21:54.746
It's nothing to worry
about, it is very common.

21:54.796 --> 21:58.186
You need to remind him that you
are a dangerous, voracious,

21:58.236 --> 22:01.466
sexual being.

22:01.516 --> 22:05.516
Let's face it, he has been
getting sukiyaki hand jobs

22:05.676 --> 22:07.586
while you just sit around being miserable.

22:07.636 --> 22:10.026
You have made your husband gay, Debs.

22:10.076 --> 22:13.546
Now, it's time to get him back.

22:13.596 --> 22:17.596
Take your black, twisted
heart and go back upstairs

22:18.396 --> 22:21.146
before I punch you in
your stupid Botoxed face

22:21.196 --> 22:24.106
and throw you out on the street.

22:24.156 --> 22:28.106
Maurice is a sensitive,
colourful, creative man.

22:28.156 --> 22:32.156
He is not gay.

22:35.196 --> 22:39.196
Everything you just said means gay.

23:04.756 --> 23:06.066
Amy.

23:06.116 --> 23:07.706
Can I talk to you?

23:07.756 --> 23:09.426
I need to tell you something.

23:09.476 --> 23:13.476
About Nana.
