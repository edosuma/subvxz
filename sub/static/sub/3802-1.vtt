01:28.522 --> 01:31.457
A man goes to sea
for many reasons.

01:31.459 --> 01:35.527
Perhaps to sense its beauty and
stare at the infinite horizon...

01:35.529 --> 01:39.832
that offers no questions,
seeks no answers.

01:39.834 --> 01:45.604
<i>Perhaps to stand in awe</i>
<i>of its power, savagery, grace.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:49.341
<i>This is all true, but there are</i>
<i>also those who go to sea...</i>

01:49.343 --> 01:54.980
ultimately because they are lost
and never want to be found.

03:11.858 --> 03:15.194
Security, code orange.

03:17.897 --> 03:22.267
I need her ready to go!

03:25.271 --> 03:28.774
Do you want to be responsible for
shutting down the entire pipeline?

03:28.776 --> 03:32.211
As soon as you get that chopper
up, you call me, you understand?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.712
Why is the ship turned?

03:33.714 --> 03:36.048
We got a low-pressure read
on the pipeline and manifold.

03:36.050 --> 03:39.952
It's more than likely an anchor dragged down
from a passing barge, but we don't know.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.353
That doesn't answer
my question.

03:41.355 --> 03:45.123
No, I thought not.
Just bring me what I need.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.994
Right. We need to put
a team in the water.

03:48.996 --> 03:49.895
Who do we have?

03:49.897 --> 03:52.097
Dive teams have already
flown back.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.699
And there's... Harris.

03:53.701 --> 03:57.636
No, Harris is a fuck-up...
take Hurst.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.372
It's gonna need a coated well,
so that's you.

04:00.374 --> 04:03.742
A DC178 is right here.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.712
Just make sure
that well holds tight.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.980
You know there's a storm
in the way.

04:07.982 --> 04:10.082
Trust me, I've had another
welder on this boat...

04:10.084 --> 04:13.452
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.721
You're in charge, get it done.

04:16.724 --> 04:20.259
I'll make sure upstairs
knows who to thank.

04:20.261 --> 04:20.858
All right.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.561
Oh, and give the kid
some bell time.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.896
The kid? He hasn't gone
below 30 meters.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.900
Putting a team down now.
Go! Fuck off!

04:28.902 --> 04:30.969
Yeah, yeah,
they're on their way.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.208
Hey, kid!

04:36.210 --> 04:38.243
You're about to get broken out.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.911
About time.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.981
Congratulations, get suited up!

04:48.454 --> 04:50.589
See you later on.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.292
Hurst.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.295
Fuck off.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.667
Hurst.

05:04.404 --> 05:08.006
It's a little early for Bible
class, ain't it, Mitch?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.844
Oh, I think it's
a little late for that.

05:12.846 --> 05:19.818
You know, it's funny. I thought this was
gonna be a strictly no-alcohol vessel.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.119
Yeah, I heard that, as well.

05:21.121 --> 05:24.056
But if you need something,
you should let me know.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.657
I need to get a team
in the water.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.493
My shift's over, mate,
I'm done.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.329
Double pay.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.300
I'll start packing now.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.403
Don't be packing
any of that, okay?

05:57.223 --> 05:58.557
More money.

05:58.559 --> 06:02.027
Yeah, I'll be back... well, I'll
be back on Saturday, won't I?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.129
It's only an extra day,
isn't it?

06:04.131 --> 06:07.265
We've been through this, haven't we?
Just get whichever pram you want.

06:07.267 --> 06:10.502
I love you. <i> LISA I love you, too.
Take care.</i>

06:10.504 --> 06:12.637
Hi, you've got the Mitchell
residence...

06:12.639 --> 06:14.840
<i>unfortunately we're a bit busy</i>
<i>to take your call right now...</i>

06:14.842 --> 06:18.243
but leave your message after the
beep and we'll call you back.

06:18.245 --> 06:22.514
Have a beautiful day.

06:28.822 --> 06:34.760
<i>KARSEN Dive team A report to
Sat Chamber 2 for lock-in.</i>

06:42.001 --> 06:43.535
Well...

06:43.537 --> 06:47.005
This is gonna be a bundle
of laughs, isn't it?

06:52.278 --> 06:55.414
See you at about midnight, Mike.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.051
Okay, Mitch, let's mix team
ready...

07:00.053 --> 07:04.055
for atmospheric compression
and diving depth.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.524
Ready for blowdown?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.859
Go for a seal. <i> Blowing down.</i>

07:07.861 --> 07:09.327
Got a seal.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.731
<i>MAN</i>
<i>SAT Chamber 2, we have secure.</i>

07:12.733 --> 07:14.466
<i>Five meters a minute, blowdown</i>

07:14.468 --> 07:18.870
<i>increasing the pressure to</i>
<i>650 feet, seabed equivalence.</i>

07:18.872 --> 07:22.974
You'll be at depth pressure
in 60 minutes. Over.

07:26.012 --> 07:29.281
Look, kid, you might want
to take the lid off.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.917
What?
You might want to unscrew that.

07:32.585 --> 07:36.588
Fucking... bollocks!

07:39.559 --> 07:41.793
For fuck's sake, man.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.505
Going to go transfer
to diving bell B, over.

07:53.507 --> 07:57.075
The diver recovery system
is working properly.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.417
Stabilizing clump weight.

08:05.419 --> 08:09.588
<i>KARSEN Open downstream valve,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.523
Bell supply skin valve open.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.226
Reading 1-9-0 at the panel,
1-9-0 at the panel. Over.

08:14.228 --> 08:19.064
<i>KARSEN Check side door seal is clean
and when you're happy, go for a seal.</i>

08:28.107 --> 08:32.910
Diving bell B, ready for
transfer to moon pool.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.254
Saturation complete.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.256
Have a good dive, lads. Over.

08:44.258 --> 08:46.691
Karsen, we're ready
to leave surface.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.599
Blowing valve open.

08:55.301 --> 08:58.803
Depth gauge... 3-0.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.741
4-0.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.111
8-0.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.554

09:19.525 --> 09:22.360
2-2-0.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.430
Need a hand?

09:25.432 --> 09:26.498
No, I'm good.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.567
3-0-0. Come on, guys, let's try
and get the mood light, okay?

09:28.569 --> 09:33.405
Anybody's got a problem with anybody
else, it stays up top, all right?

09:33.407 --> 09:35.640
All right?

09:38.711 --> 09:40.645
3-4-0.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.993

10:23.022 --> 10:26.157
That is 6-5-0.
All stop on the bell.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.259
All stop.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.872
Seal open, 20:00 hours.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.274
Yeah, how many? Roger that.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.011
Engel, bring all
the welding rods.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.545
Front plate locked.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.748
Head forward. Clamping on.

11:41.934 --> 11:45.203
Diver one, two, and three,
all locked out.

11:45.205 --> 11:49.607
Bell to divers, do you copy?
Over.<i> Diver one?</i>

11:49.609 --> 11:50.542
Copy.

11:50.544 --> 11:54.312
There's a mirror in my bag if you
need to check your hair. Over.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.048
Dickhead.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.255
Bell to surface. Comms check.
How do you read? Over.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.759
<i>KARSEN Loud and clear.</i>

12:08.794 --> 12:10.295
The weight coat is damaged.

12:10.297 --> 12:13.098
The anchor dragged right
across the manifold.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.501
There's a tear
across the feed pipe.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.702
Make it hot.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.370
It's hot.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.547
All stop on the dive.

13:35.549 --> 13:38.850
Jones, what was that?
I don't know, the whole bell...

13:38.852 --> 13:39.818
Get on the radio now.

13:39.820 --> 13:43.188
Okay! Bell to surface,
bell to surface.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.722
Divers two and three,
are we good?

13:44.724 --> 13:46.691
Diver two, all good.
Diver three, good.

13:46.693 --> 13:50.929
Bell to surface! <i> The storm has come!
Repeat, the storm has come!</i>

13:52.032 --> 13:56.801
You're breaking up! I
can't hear you! Shit!

13:56.803 --> 14:01.005
The comms are breaking up! I think
Karsen wants back to the surface!

14:01.007 --> 14:02.707
He said something about a storm!

14:02.709 --> 14:03.541
How much longer?

14:03.543 --> 14:04.909
A few more minutes. What?

14:04.911 --> 14:06.277
We came here to do a job.

14:06.279 --> 14:09.380
During a fucking storm,
we didn't. Fuck this.

14:09.382 --> 14:14.552
Get back here, Hurst.
Hurst, get back here.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.055
Engel, we need to finish
the weld.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.990
Make it hot, then.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.127
Lorimer, do you copy?

14:23.129 --> 14:25.029
Hurst, I've lost contact!

14:27.399 --> 14:32.270
Karsen? Karsen, do you copy?
Over.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.042
Do you copy?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.211
Hurst!

14:40.213 --> 14:44.649
It's all right. Mitchell,
you need to get back here now!

14:44.651 --> 14:45.550
We're done.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.286
Get back to the bell now!

14:51.523 --> 14:52.724
Mitchell, come in!

14:52.726 --> 14:55.493
Jonesy, take up the umbilicals.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.734
We keep going in and out
of contact.

15:02.736 --> 15:03.801
I'll take it from here.

15:03.803 --> 15:04.869
Jones, let's stash the hats.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.472
Karsen, this is Mitch,
do you copy? Over.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.674
We've just been hit.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.078
We need to get you...

15:14.080 --> 15:18.182
If you can read me, we're set,
we're ready for ascent. Over.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.385
Everybody get strapped in.

15:30.996 --> 15:34.999
Ascending from storage depth
6-5-0.

15:39.138 --> 15:41.706
6-0-0.

15:41.708 --> 15:42.974
I didn't even get in the water.

15:42.976 --> 15:46.277
Yeah, well, we can always leave
you down here if you want.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.586
5-3-0.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.298
5-0-0.

16:11.037 --> 16:14.305
There's something wrong.
Karsen, is there a problem?

16:14.307 --> 16:18.443
Bell to Karsen,
do you read me? Over.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.846
Bell to Karsen,
do you read me? Over.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.614
Karsen, come on!
What's happening?

16:23.616 --> 16:29.253
GPS signal is gone. We'll be dragged all
over the ocean until we get a damn signal.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.090
Bell to surface, do you read me?
Over.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.525
Why aren't we stabilizing? I don't
know why we're not stabilizing.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.695
'Cause we're in one hell
of a storm, that's why!

16:44.269 --> 16:47.005
We've dropped!

16:47.007 --> 16:53.878
We're dropping at speed! Karsen, all
stop on the bell! All stop on the bell!

16:53.880 --> 16:55.680
Diving!

16:56.682 --> 16:59.217
6-0-0! Hold on, it's coming!

16:59.219 --> 17:00.685
620!

17:00.687 --> 17:05.189
Put a hat on!
Brace yourselves! Brace! Brace!

17:06.558 --> 17:08.259
Brace!

17:29.516 --> 17:31.649
Hold him down!

17:33.786 --> 17:35.920
Hold him down!

17:35.922 --> 17:38.456
Hold him down! Hold him down!

17:38.458 --> 17:40.658
Hold him!

17:40.660 --> 17:42.160
Open your jaw! Hold him down!

17:42.162 --> 17:46.297
Keep him still, Hurst!
We need him still! Keep still!

17:46.299 --> 17:48.132
Easy.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.137
Oh, fuck.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.172
Barotrauma...

17:54.174 --> 17:58.643
pressure caught in a tooth
cavity, under your filling.

17:59.344 --> 18:01.579
Bell to surface,
bell to surface.

18:03.148 --> 18:06.284
Bell to surface, do you copy?
Over.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.652
Internal pressure is stable.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.221
I'm gonna assess the damage.
You're gonna do what?

18:10.223 --> 18:13.724
I'm gonna assess the damage.

18:14.893 --> 18:15.827
Do it. Yeah.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.128
Hurst, suit him up. Right.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.496
And check the seal.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.631
Jonesy, you all right?
Oh, fuck it all.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.933
Can you stand up? You okay?

18:21.935 --> 18:25.103
Fuck yeah. Can you focus?

18:28.307 --> 18:32.710
Oxygen cylinders
on port side all secure.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.980
Damage from the fall
appears minimal.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.516
We got off lightly.

18:40.686 --> 18:45.123
OB3 pressure reading
at 90 percent.

18:45.125 --> 18:50.194
The beacon on top of the bell
is transmitting as normal.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.196
We're still pinging.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.465
Still no comms.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.869
Why did they drop us
so quickly?

18:57.871 --> 18:59.637
Listen, Jonesy, we just
have to wait it out.

18:59.639 --> 19:03.741
They put us on the floor for a reason. They'll
take us back up to the surface when they can.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.644
We just need to stay calm.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.779
Bell to Karsen, it's Mitch,
do you read me? Over.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.781
Why aren't they answering?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.917
They're riding out the worst of it, then
they're gonna haul us back up, right?

19:12.919 --> 19:18.089
Hurst, we need an inventory of the bell,
first aid box, survival suits, blankets...

19:18.091 --> 19:19.891
Got it! Flares.

19:28.667 --> 19:35.439
Blankets, first aid...
no survival suits.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.207
What?

19:36.209 --> 19:38.643
There's no fucking
survival suits.

19:40.512 --> 19:44.382
We should be okay. Back-up
heating supply is working.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.550
Where's Engel?

19:45.552 --> 19:49.554
With any luck, he's trapped
inside a whale.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.857
Engel, give me an update.
How does she look?

19:52.859 --> 19:55.459
Hold on a minute.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.930
I want to check
the umbilical to the ship.

21:35.260 --> 21:40.431
You know your old man was always
teetotal whenever we dived in Asia?

21:40.433 --> 21:41.599
That's bollocks.

21:41.601 --> 21:45.569
No, serious, he never
touched a drop.

21:45.571 --> 21:49.473
He had this deep-rooted
fear of the place.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.642
He was terrified he'd get pissed
and wake up...

21:51.644 --> 21:56.747
with some lady boy with a big
stiffie, loving him long time.

21:56.749 --> 22:00.618
You met your wife out there, didn't you?
Popping out ping pongs?

22:00.620 --> 22:03.354
Yeah, I caught a few.

22:06.758 --> 22:10.061
Engel, what's the external
damage?

22:11.730 --> 22:14.532
What's the external damage?

22:16.535 --> 22:18.569
Engel!

22:20.038 --> 22:22.106
The ship is down.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.375
What? What are you
talking about?

22:24.377 --> 22:28.479
Don't listen to him, the guy's
a walking, fucking Jonah.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.386
What the hell is that?

22:35.388 --> 22:37.621
That belongs to the
winch mechanism.

22:37.623 --> 22:41.125
Whoa, whoa, sure, the winch mechanism
may have sustained some damage.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.460
You're not listening to me.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.830
Now the ship has other means of rescue. They're
going through those options as we speak.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.366
Now Jones, get on the radio.
Huh?

22:48.368 --> 22:49.700
Get on the radio!

22:49.702 --> 22:51.736
And the first thing that we need
to do is re-establish radio...

22:51.738 --> 22:53.904
Bell to surface. Bell to surface.
The ship is down.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.273
Radio contact...
The fucking ship is down!

22:56.275 --> 22:58.342
Bell to surface.

23:03.515 --> 23:07.151
I just saw Karsen's dead body
on the ocean floor.

23:07.153 --> 23:12.256
There's no one there, Mitchell.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.625
We're on our own.

23:56.568 --> 24:00.504
We should have left
when Karsen gave the order.

24:00.506 --> 24:05.309
We're only alive because we
never made it to the surface.

24:05.311 --> 24:08.412
We got what, around 18 hours
breathing supply?

24:08.414 --> 24:09.713
How long until someone finds us?

24:09.715 --> 24:13.951
I don't know. How could
I possibly know that?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.520
We're around, what,
five hours from Mombasa.

24:16.522 --> 24:21.459
Now the ship would have sent out a Mayday,
so the rescue teams are probably under way.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.093
But once they're in range...

24:23.095 --> 24:25.362
they'll pick up the bell's
location beacon. I don't know!

24:25.364 --> 24:28.165
We're in the middle of the Indian
Ocean off the coast of Africa.

24:28.167 --> 24:32.002
There are more pirates in these
waters than there are fish.

24:32.004 --> 24:36.307
Do you really think that Vaxxilon are gonna
risk sending another crew to rescue us?

24:36.309 --> 24:37.341
Yeah, why wouldn't they?

24:37.343 --> 24:38.909
Vaxxilon are in lockdown.

24:38.911 --> 24:42.513
They're figuring out some PR
strategy to cover their asses.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.348
They just lost one boat, they're
not gonna risk losing another.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.217
Well, I guarantee you,
a rescue is under way.

24:46.219 --> 24:49.019
And I guarantee you that they're already
filling out their insurance claims.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.955
Oh, come on!
How the fuck is this helpful?

24:50.957 --> 24:52.656
It's simple economics,
you dumb ass.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.258
You're say... you're saying
they're not gonna come?

24:54.260 --> 24:55.759
He's wrong!
It's in our contracts!

24:55.761 --> 25:00.931
In an emergency situation, all saturation
divers are transferred to a high...

25:00.933 --> 25:02.633
The unit went down
with the ship!

25:02.635 --> 25:04.969
Okay, well, then they'll send
another bell down.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.504
If? If they're looking for us!

25:06.506 --> 25:08.706
Shut up!
No, you shut the fuck up!

25:08.708 --> 25:09.740
Yo! Back off!

25:09.742 --> 25:14.645
You think they would have sent us down in a
storm if they gave a shit about our safety?

25:17.282 --> 25:21.719
They'll write it off as a freak of nature,
as a force major, as an act of God!

25:21.721 --> 25:23.454
And your doting wife
can go to your funeral...

25:23.456 --> 25:26.257
in the misguided belief
that she lost a hero!

25:26.259 --> 25:28.926
Shut up! Shut up!
That is enough!

25:28.928 --> 25:30.728
Now none of us wants to be
in this situation...

25:30.730 --> 25:33.430
but we do what we are trained to
do, we stay focused...

25:33.432 --> 25:36.734
and I promise you we will
get out of here!

25:38.336 --> 25:40.004
Vaxxilon will come to get us.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.706
We sit, wait,
conserve oxygen, that's it.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.876
Now, sit down!

25:48.547 --> 25:50.648
Please.

26:09.134 --> 26:15.339
We do know that the weld
was at the DC178 manifold.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.340
Yeah, write this down.

26:16.342 --> 26:21.412
DC178 manifold, 19 degrees,
14 minutes south...

26:21.414 --> 26:25.115
71 degrees, 33 minutes east.
You got that?

26:25.117 --> 26:30.487
Okay, get on comms, transmit
that position every 15 minutes.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.690
We're a lost bell
from the DSV Lorimer.

26:32.692 --> 26:36.193
Our coordinates are 19 degrees,
14 minutes south...

26:36.195 --> 26:37.328
We need to float the bell.

26:37.330 --> 26:39.163
Detach the clump weight
and make her buoyant.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.965
We'll be a hell of a lot more
visible on the surface.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.634
No, because right now, pressure
is equalized inside and out.

26:43.636 --> 26:47.104
But the bell rises, the pressure drops,
the chamber could become compromised...

26:47.106 --> 26:48.806
but we're not gonna know that
until it's too late.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.241
If we lose pressure inside
the bell, we're all dead.

26:51.243 --> 26:55.813
We follow procedure
and wait for Vaxxilon.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.315
Shit! We're losing oxygen!

26:58.317 --> 27:00.484
Right! Put your emergency
masks on now!

27:00.486 --> 27:02.853
The CO2 level is nearly red.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.923
My mask, I can't breathe!
My mask is broken!

27:05.925 --> 27:09.059
Put the mask on! It's broke!
I can't put the mask on!

27:09.061 --> 27:11.195
You need to reboot the power
supply!

27:11.197 --> 27:13.464
Clear the air
with a fresh O2 tank!

27:13.466 --> 27:15.065
Here, put the mask on.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.835
Hurst... Hurst, you got my mask!

27:17.837 --> 27:19.970
Engel's down!

27:21.007 --> 27:22.406
Engel, breathe!

27:22.408 --> 27:25.809
Power supply rebooting.

27:25.811 --> 27:29.413
O2 levels increasing.
It's stabilizing, breathe!

27:29.415 --> 27:32.650
Hurst, you're a little late.
Breathe!

27:35.553 --> 27:37.354
Bell's breathing system
malfunctioned.

27:37.356 --> 27:40.224
We were taking
in our own carbon dioxide.

27:49.367 --> 27:53.871
Two hours... how did we just
lose two hours of breathing gas?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.305
We lost an external cylinder.

27:55.307 --> 27:56.674
I know we lost an external
cylinder!

27:56.676 --> 27:58.342
I sent you out there to check
for damage!

27:58.344 --> 28:01.145
No, the umbilical was on the ocean floor,
that took priority! That just cost us!

28:01.147 --> 28:05.983
And you'd still be waiting for a
fucking ghost ship to haul us back up!

28:05.985 --> 28:07.184
We need to float the bell.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.086
How many times are you gonna
make me go through this?

28:09.088 --> 28:10.889
All we have to trust
in is your belief system.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.490
If we locate the ship, we'll have
enough breathing gas for a month.

28:13.492 --> 28:16.660
The ship could be scattered for miles.
Just get back on the comms!

28:16.662 --> 28:20.030
Then we follow the main umbilical.
It has to lead us to the ship!

28:20.032 --> 28:23.434
If it's still attached. We don't
know we're gonna find what we need!

28:23.436 --> 28:24.435
I say we try.

28:24.437 --> 28:26.270
- We're not gonna have enough gas.
- Bell to surface.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.806
Look, we gotta do something. If the
bell freezes, we die. Mayday, Mayday.

28:28.808 --> 28:34.445
We run out of air, we die. We don't
do something soon, we fucking die!

28:34.447 --> 28:37.181
<i>RADIO OP</i>
<i>This is Jiuxing. Come in.</i>

28:37.183 --> 28:38.949

30:19.952 --> 30:23.854
Do you know how much
I've spent on Chinese food?

30:57.355 --> 31:01.358
Hurst, check and recheck
the cylinders on the port side.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.660
We can't afford to lose
any more air.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.963
Yeah, I'm on it.

31:14.172 --> 31:17.941

I love your surprises.

31:18.943 --> 31:21.478
Tell me.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.548
Come on. I wanna know.

31:32.391 --> 31:36.393
<i>¶ Look back from where I came</i>

31:36.395 --> 31:41.999
¶ My tears

31:43.501 --> 31:46.303
¶ And dancing in the rain.

31:46.305 --> 31:50.173
You don't think anybody's
coming, do you?

31:54.879 --> 32:00.083
If you don't have hope,
what do you have?

32:00.085 --> 32:02.986
I have reason.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.805
Onboard cylinder one secure.

32:21.807 --> 32:25.142
Valve open and functioning.

32:26.244 --> 32:29.746
OB cylinder 4 secure
on the starboard side.

32:29.748 --> 32:32.683
Valve and reading's normal.

32:35.186 --> 32:38.488
There's something
on the top of the bell.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.190
<i>Looks like a crane block.</i>

32:40.192 --> 32:43.160
Hurst, is there any damage
to the valve?

32:43.162 --> 32:44.962
Hold on.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.899
<i>No, it doesn't look like it.</i>

32:48.901 --> 32:51.768
<i>Okay, can you make it secure?</i>

32:51.770 --> 32:54.071
Yeah, I'm on it.

32:55.740 --> 32:58.508
It's one heavy bastard.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.943
Shit!

33:03.182 --> 33:06.249
- Mitchell's down.
- What happened?

33:06.251 --> 33:09.519
I... I think he got hit.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.388
No, Mitch is not moving.
He's not moving.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.890
<i>ENGEL What do you mean, he's not moving?
Can you read me?</i>

33:13.892 --> 33:16.193
- I think he's unconscious!

<i>Open his breathe flow.</i>
<i>I'm trying to open it.</i>

33:17.963 --> 33:22.299
<i>ENGEL Right. Turn him face down
and drag him back to the bell.</i>

33:22.301 --> 33:24.201
<i>I can't move him.</i>
<i>There's not enough slack.</i>

33:24.203 --> 33:27.738
Hurst, what are you doing?
His umbilical's snagged.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.272
Fuck! Fuck! It's stuck.

33:29.274 --> 33:31.575
<i>ENGEL Detach him.
The fucking thing is stuck.</i>

33:31.577 --> 33:33.710
<i>ENGEL Detach him. Fuck! Fuck!</i>

33:33.712 --> 33:35.879
Hurst. What do I do?

33:35.881 --> 33:39.049
<i>I can't move him. Listen to me. If you
don't detach him, he's gonna die!</i>

33:39.051 --> 33:42.252
I can't move him.
I can't move him.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.418
Come on!

34:25.029 --> 34:28.799
Here you go. You're okay.
You're okay.

34:30.967 --> 34:33.469
Get that weight off him.

34:37.108 --> 34:39.309
Get it off.

34:53.157 --> 34:55.759
How are you still diving?

34:55.761 --> 34:57.394
The mechanism was fucked.

34:57.396 --> 35:00.964
Your hands are useless. You have
no place being on the sat team.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.999
What did you do,
forge your medical records?

35:03.001 --> 35:05.802
How do you think I got
these hands?

35:05.804 --> 35:07.938
Picking fucking daisies?

35:07.940 --> 35:11.475
18 years. 18 fucking years
in the water.

35:11.477 --> 35:16.313
18 years soaked in booze.
I nearly fucking died.

35:17.281 --> 35:18.949
I fucked up. I'm sorry, man.

35:18.951 --> 35:22.052
You just took your last dive.

35:22.054 --> 35:24.287
Let's get this off.

35:56.787 --> 35:58.722
You've got the Mitchell
residence.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.191
<i>Unfortunately we're a bit busy</i>
<i>to take your call right now...</i>

36:01.193 --> 36:05.128
but leave your message after the
beep and we'll call you back.

36:05.130 --> 36:07.297
Have a beautiful day.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.472
Mitch.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.206
Yeah?

36:16.208 --> 36:18.341
We've lost over half
of our air.

36:19.243 --> 36:22.212
We've got to do something. There's
nothing that we can do except wait.

36:22.214 --> 36:26.716
Come on, even if they're in the water,
how are they gonna know we're here?

36:26.718 --> 36:28.118
We don't even know where we are.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.853
The bell's location beacon
transmits automatically.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.022
And its range is what?
I don't know. 750 feet?

36:32.024 --> 36:37.661
So unless the boat is directly above
us, they won't know we're here.

36:38.896 --> 36:44.267
You've got to seal the bell
and take her to the surface.

36:46.771 --> 36:48.271
You already know my answer.

36:48.273 --> 36:54.144
What the fuck are you waiting
for? St Christopher?

36:54.146 --> 36:55.212
Great.

36:55.214 --> 37:00.317
Vaxxilon are coming, Engel,
and I'm not taking that risk.

37:00.319 --> 37:06.256
Of course, it's a risk.
So is doing nothing.

37:21.572 --> 37:25.508
I was joking about
your old man, you know.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.277
What was he like?

37:27.279 --> 37:29.980
He was a good diver.

37:29.982 --> 37:33.083
And he was a funny fucker, too.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.151
I barely saw him smile.

37:35.153 --> 37:39.489
Yeah, well, families
ain't easy, are they?

37:41.025 --> 37:45.295
When you're down here,
you wish you were back home.

37:45.297 --> 37:51.301
And when you're with them, you
just wish you were back down here.

37:51.303 --> 37:56.273
It don't make a lot of sense.

37:56.275 --> 37:59.476
I have a son.

37:59.478 --> 38:04.681
I haven't seen or spoken
to him since he was five.

38:08.152 --> 38:11.021
He's married now.

38:11.023 --> 38:14.457
I don't even know
his wife's name.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.763
That won't happen to me.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.466
Yeah.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.970
That's what we all say.

39:09.714 --> 39:13.083
<i>MITCH Even though I walk
through the darkest valley...</i>

39:13.085 --> 39:18.688
I fear no evil,
for you are with me.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.458
The Lord is with you.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.327
Wherever you go.

39:51.456 --> 39:54.524
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

39:55.926 --> 39:59.129
Is there anybody out there?

40:01.966 --> 40:05.902
Is there anybody out there?

40:09.373 --> 40:11.541
Hurst.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.580
What happened?
Hurst's in the water.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.617
What? Hurst's in the water.
Hurst, come in. Over.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.051
Oh, shit.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.020
Hurst, what are you doing?

40:24.022 --> 40:28.057
I'm gonna fix things.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.259
What does that mean?

40:29.261 --> 40:31.127
I'm gonna find the ship.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.829
You are not authorized
to be in the water.

40:32.831 --> 40:36.666
I am instructing you
to return to the bell now.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.902
He'll never find the ship.

40:39.937 --> 40:43.773
I remember your first
sat dive, Mitch.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.943
You could barely put one foot
in front of the other.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.212
<i>- I guided you.
- MITCH I remember, okay?</i>

40:49.214 --> 40:52.682
<i>Now, turn around. You're gonna</i>
<i>get yourself killed.</i>

40:52.684 --> 41:00.223
<i>I was diving in the North Sea when they
were losing over a hundred a year.</i>

41:00.225 --> 41:02.125
That was before all of you.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.294
And I'm telling you...

41:04.296 --> 41:07.197
to turn around.

41:07.199 --> 41:10.133
<i>HURST Go fuck yourself.</i>

41:10.135 --> 41:13.470
<i>Hurst! It's getting warm.</i>

41:13.472 --> 41:15.238
It's so warm down here.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.040
How long have you been
in the water?

41:17.042 --> 41:19.843
<i>HURST He's missing his dad.
I'm still his dad.</i>

41:19.845 --> 41:24.447
He's rambling.
It's hypothermia.

41:25.683 --> 41:28.451
They take from you,
but they don't want you.

41:28.453 --> 41:29.919
They just push you...

41:29.921 --> 41:34.157
The wreckage could be scattered
for miles.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.892
Hurst.
<i>I'm gonna have to sit down.</i>

41:35.894 --> 41:40.630
<i>Hurst.</i>
<i>It's too hot. It's too hot.</i>

41:41.298 --> 41:43.066
Keep on top of things.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.235
He's gonna freeze to death.

41:45.237 --> 41:48.371
Can't we pull him in?
He's too far out.

41:48.373 --> 41:51.774
The valve on his suit
won't hold.

41:51.776 --> 41:54.511
Hurst, come in. Over.

42:02.820 --> 42:06.689
<i>It's going... It's...</i>

42:06.691 --> 42:10.994
<i>Should have...</i>

42:10.996 --> 42:13.563
Cut the gas.

42:15.499 --> 42:17.367
He's wasting vital air.

42:17.369 --> 42:19.936
We're not cutting off
anybody's breathing supply.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.704
He's using three times
the amount of air.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.474
The longer he's in the water,
the less air we have.

42:24.476 --> 42:26.876
We don't decide who dies.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.679
Maybe you don't.

42:32.349 --> 42:34.717
One less breath in here...

42:34.719 --> 42:38.421
could be the difference between you
seeing your wife and children again...

42:38.423 --> 42:40.490
or them seeing you in a box.

42:40.492 --> 42:43.526
No... no.

42:46.864 --> 42:48.665
We gotta do something, Mitch.

42:48.667 --> 42:51.100
<i>HURST My boy never...</i>

42:51.102 --> 42:55.772
The free flow
is pumping vital air.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.309
You need to respond. Over.

42:59.311 --> 43:03.212
Hurst, talk to me now. Over.

43:14.558 --> 43:20.096
<i>HURST My boy... it's hot...</i>

44:22.893 --> 44:28.264
If we live,
we live for the Lord.

44:28.799 --> 44:31.634
And if we die,
we die for the Lord.

44:31.636 --> 44:35.805
So if we live or die,
we belong to the Lord.

44:35.807 --> 44:37.640
Amen.

47:07.859 --> 47:10.226
Breathe.

47:11.862 --> 47:14.330
You all right?

47:17.267 --> 47:19.936
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

47:20.971 --> 47:23.172
Don't lose hope.

47:23.907 --> 47:27.109
Lisa hates hospitals.

47:27.111 --> 47:30.947
She doesn't even like
walking past them.

47:30.949 --> 47:36.085
Says they smell of... loss.

47:36.087 --> 47:39.355
Full of broken people.

47:43.493 --> 47:45.928
Who's gonna go with her?

47:48.432 --> 47:51.601
She'll be on her own.

47:56.673 --> 47:59.075
What's it like?

47:59.077 --> 48:01.644
What? The birth?

48:01.646 --> 48:02.645
I'm terrified of it.

48:02.647 --> 48:05.248
There ain't a man alive
who's not afraid of that.

48:05.250 --> 48:11.454
I mean, one minute you're standing in
this strange room and the next you're...

48:14.691 --> 48:18.527
holding this precious...

48:18.529 --> 48:21.898
You won't ever wanna let go.

48:21.900 --> 48:24.967
I remember when Taylor was born.

48:24.969 --> 48:27.069
My first.

48:28.205 --> 48:30.940
I was stuck offshore.

48:30.942 --> 48:36.879
By the time I arrived, Carmel had
been in that room for over 13 hours.

48:36.881 --> 48:41.050
She gave me such a look.

48:41.052 --> 48:43.452
You know, I mean,
I thought she was gonna kill me.

48:43.454 --> 48:47.423
And then suddenly out he came.

48:48.692 --> 48:51.928
And I said to her,
you know, I said...

48:51.930 --> 48:55.331
"He wasn't ready to come out. He
was waiting for the right time.

48:55.333 --> 48:58.034
"He was waiting
for his daddy to arrive."

48:58.036 --> 49:01.504
And she said to me, "If that's
the case, Peter Mitchell...

49:01.506 --> 49:05.174
"you should have been here
at the start, you idiot."

49:10.614 --> 49:12.815
How did you end up
in the water?

49:12.817 --> 49:15.785
You know, the beauty of it.

49:19.389 --> 49:21.357
The peace.

49:22.259 --> 49:26.529
It's kind of like an affair,
you know?

49:26.531 --> 49:31.534
I won't let go of her
and she won't let go of me.

49:37.375 --> 49:39.308
It's the heater.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.243
Oh, shit.

49:41.245 --> 49:43.713
The element's gone.

49:48.618 --> 49:51.721
Shit. What are the options?

49:55.959 --> 50:00.129
This gonna work?
Yeah, absolutely.

50:00.131 --> 50:05.134
I mean, it's a little crude,
but... it should do the job.

50:05.136 --> 50:08.371
One homemade steam boiler.

50:10.974 --> 50:12.575
Well done, kid.

50:13.477 --> 50:16.112
Hey, at least we'll die warm.

50:16.114 --> 50:18.214
How long we got?

50:19.983 --> 50:23.185
A little over an hour.

50:31.895 --> 50:33.863
To my sweet Carmel...

50:33.865 --> 50:36.032
I'm writing these words
in the hope...

50:36.034 --> 50:38.467
that you never get
to read them.

50:38.469 --> 50:40.036
Forgive me.

50:40.038 --> 50:45.007
<i>I know I should have listened when
you said you wanted me to stop.</i>

51:07.464 --> 51:13.736
¶ Dah dah dah dah dah
dah dah dah dah dah.

51:25.583 --> 51:28.451
Lorimer bell. Lorimer bell.

51:28.453 --> 51:30.553
<i>COMMANDER</i>
<i>How do you read me? Over.</i>

51:30.555 --> 51:32.855
Yes, yes, loud and clear. Over.

51:32.857 --> 51:36.225
<i>COMMANDER This is the commander of
the navy frigate HMS Marlborough.</i>

51:36.227 --> 51:40.396
<i>COMMANDER Can you give me a sit rep
on your number of divers? Over.</i>

51:40.398 --> 51:43.732
We are a four-man
saturation dive...

51:43.734 --> 51:46.669
Correction.
We are a three-man dive team.

51:46.671 --> 51:51.040
<i>COMMANDER Can you state
your exact position? Over.</i>

51:51.042 --> 51:53.409
Commander, we don't know
our exact location.

51:53.411 --> 51:57.012
I would imagine that Vaxxilon have
sent the pipeline coordinates.

51:57.014 --> 52:00.916
<i>COMMANDER Negative.
We have had no contact with Vaxxilon.</i>

52:00.918 --> 52:06.122
<i>COMMANDER Your distress signal was
intercepted by a Chinese vessel.</i>

52:06.124 --> 52:09.792
<i>COMMANDER Can you give your
last known coordinates? Over.</i>

52:09.794 --> 52:12.361
Jonesy, notebook, notebook.

52:14.397 --> 52:17.967
Our coordinates were
19 degrees, 14 minutes south...

52:17.969 --> 52:20.136
71 degrees, 33 minutes east.
Over.

52:20.138 --> 52:23.973
<i>COMMANDER Without exact coordinates,
it's going to be time-consuming. Over.</i>

52:23.975 --> 52:26.976
Well, time is one thing that we
have precious little of, Commander.

52:26.978 --> 52:30.112
<i>COMMANDER Roger that, but I'm
afraid we are talking hours...</i>

52:30.114 --> 52:35.384
not minutes. We're coming.
Over and out.

52:41.224 --> 52:45.594
Vaxxilon just hung us
out to dry.

52:51.067 --> 52:54.870
Mitch, Mitch, I've got an idea.

52:54.872 --> 52:56.639
If we can find a field
marking...

52:56.641 --> 53:00.509
the drywall chambers on the
pipelines carry spare cylinders.

53:00.511 --> 53:02.778
If we mix the gas
with our remaining helium...

53:02.780 --> 53:05.681
it might...
might just buy us enough time.

53:05.683 --> 53:07.183
We'll have drifted for miles.

53:07.185 --> 53:08.651
There's no way of knowing
where it is.

53:08.653 --> 53:10.386
It's like the interstate
highway down there.

53:10.388 --> 53:13.656
Now we hit one direction, we're bound
to hit a pipeline sooner or later.

53:13.658 --> 53:14.990
What if the drywall chambers
are empty?

53:14.992 --> 53:17.359
We're gonna die before
that ship arrives anyway.

53:17.361 --> 53:20.162
I don't think we have a choice.

53:37.847 --> 53:40.950
I'm heading out, heading north.

53:45.121 --> 53:48.524
Are we happy? I think so.

53:49.559 --> 53:50.993
One sec. I thought you
said you were done.

53:50.995 --> 53:53.729
Come on, Jones.
I am. I am. I am.

54:03.907 --> 54:05.441
Engel, how's the heat?

54:05.443 --> 54:08.510
More Seattle than Florida.

54:14.417 --> 54:16.252
His umbilical's at halfway.

54:16.254 --> 54:20.789
- Can you see anything?
- <i> ENGEL No, not yet.</i>

54:24.194 --> 54:25.694
Water.

54:28.231 --> 54:31.400
There must be something here.

54:40.176 --> 54:42.578
Halle-fucking-lujah.

54:42.580 --> 54:45.581
He found it.
Can you see any markings?

54:46.483 --> 54:48.684
I'm by a field joint.

54:48.686 --> 54:50.753
Okay, but you're running
out of umbilical.

54:50.755 --> 54:54.290
I'm at SG3A5.

54:54.292 --> 54:56.258
Yeah, I've got it.

54:56.260 --> 55:00.162
Okay, there's no weld chamber there.
Okay, try the adjacent pipeline.

55:00.164 --> 55:03.299
It's about 30 meters
if you head East.

55:03.301 --> 55:06.635
I'm cold. I need more heat.

55:08.571 --> 55:10.873
No. No.

55:14.644 --> 55:17.079
We're out of gas.
Engel, there's no more heat.

55:17.081 --> 55:18.247
You need to get back here now.

55:18.249 --> 55:22.651
No... if I do that,
we're all dead.

55:25.622 --> 55:29.024
Bodies everywhere.

55:31.828 --> 55:36.231
I'm in situ. Where now?
Southwest or northeast?

55:36.233 --> 55:37.032
Southwest.

55:37.034 --> 55:40.069
Are you sure? How far?

55:40.071 --> 55:42.504
Come on. It's 20 meters.

55:53.883 --> 55:55.751
I've found it, Mitchell.

55:57.420 --> 55:58.721
<i>Shit.</i> What?

55:58.723 --> 56:03.125
<i>The umbilical's all played out.</i>
<i>I'm at the end of the line.</i>

56:03.127 --> 56:05.728
<i>I can see the drywall chamber.</i>
<i>I'm gonna detach.</i>

56:05.730 --> 56:08.430
No, that's not a good idea.
You'll lose your comms.

56:08.432 --> 56:12.601
<i>ENGEL Switching feed to bailout.
</i> Engel.

56:13.837 --> 56:16.438
Engel.

56:26.015 --> 56:31.353
Okay, you need to keep both channels
open, and let me know if he responds.

56:34.124 --> 56:35.257
Engel, can you hear me?

56:35.259 --> 56:38.527
Engel, head back
to the field joint.

56:38.529 --> 56:40.095
I'm on my way.

56:41.131 --> 56:42.965
You need to respond.

56:48.138 --> 56:52.975
Engel, do you read me? Over.
I'm at SG3A5.

56:52.977 --> 56:56.912
<i>Engel, talk to me.</i>
Mitch, have you got a visual?

56:58.214 --> 57:01.784
I'm at the end of his
umbilical. He's detached.

57:01.786 --> 57:05.487
Turn off diver two
breathing supply.

57:14.998 --> 57:17.466
Wait.

57:17.468 --> 57:19.468
I think I see him. He's down.

57:19.470 --> 57:21.670
But I think he's got
a cylinder.

57:24.941 --> 57:29.445
Jones, he's got a cylinder.
He's got a cylinder.

57:38.354 --> 57:40.055
Engel.

57:41.825 --> 57:42.958
Come on.

57:42.960 --> 57:47.129
<i>I'm at the end of my umbilical.</i>
<i>Can't rea...</i>

57:47.131 --> 57:50.065
I got him. I got him.

57:58.741 --> 58:00.542
Mitch, how much further?

58:00.544 --> 58:05.080
We're ten feet from the bell.
Get ready to haul him in.

58:13.723 --> 58:17.793
Come on. Come on. Come on.

58:18.428 --> 58:21.096
Come on. Let's get you...

58:25.568 --> 58:29.071
Mitch, hurry up! Let's go.

58:29.073 --> 58:33.008
I need you to do
the cylinders. Go!

58:37.480 --> 58:40.182
Do the fucking cylinder!

58:52.495 --> 58:54.563
It's on.

58:55.899 --> 58:57.766
Oh, my god.

59:23.526 --> 59:25.861
Oh, fuck.

59:52.455 --> 59:53.288
He moved.

59:53.290 --> 59:57.526
He just fucking moved.
He just fucking...

59:57.528 --> 01:00:00.562
Help me get him up.
Lift him up.

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:05.067
Get the emergency mask.

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:06.835
Put it on him.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:32.327
I don't know how he's
still alive...

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:36.098
but he's just given us
another two hours.

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:43.772
Hey, how you doing? Huh?

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:45.707
That good?

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:50.512
Lorimer bell. Lorimer bell.
Please respond. Over.

01:00:50.514 --> 01:00:51.880
How close are you? Over.

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:55.217
<i>COMMANDER We should be in range of
your coordinates within 90 minutes.</i>

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:59.087
<i>But we'll still need to locate</i>
<i>your exact position.</i>

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.156
Vaxxilon have closed
all communications.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:07.696
<i>We don't have the maps. We need
to speed up the search. Over.</i>

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:09.231
What about the location beacon?
Over.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:11.900
- Are you picking up the signal?
- COMMANDER Negative.

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:15.137
<i>We can use sonar, but the</i>
<i>ship's wreckage is scattered.</i>

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:17.239
It could be a long search.
Over.

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:20.642
Well, hurry up 'cause we're
running out of time.

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:24.479
We will contact you
once we have more to go on.

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:26.715
Over and out.

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.693
Mitch, what if we float
the beacon?

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.394
It's still attached.
How do we do that?

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:44.966
We de-rig it, we bring it into the bell
and then we make it buoyant somehow.

01:01:44.968 --> 01:01:49.037
Take the umbilical as far as she goes
and then float the beacon from there.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:53.842
Otherwise it could get caught in the
deep water currents. It's possible.

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:55.510
Get it closer to the surface.

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:57.379
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:59.281
Yeah, that could work.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.821
It has to hold.

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:09.224
It will, but it'll drain
the charge fast...

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:14.362
so once you're set, you flick the
switch and it activates the signal.

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:18.166
The ship should be in range
within the hour.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.069
Who goes?

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.075
I do.

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.745
<i>Where's the beacon?</i>

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:32.748
It'll be a couple of minutes.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.617
It was my birthday last week.

01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:41.323
Apparently I promised Carmel I'd
stop diving by the time I was 35.

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:45.994
I don't even remember
making that promise.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:52.501
It's the longest we haven't
spoken since we were 19.

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:05.313
I don't mean anything
without them.

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:09.284
Is that sad?

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.488
It's perfect.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.536
You know, I was
almost married once.

01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:32.808
I'd just proposed to her
and we were on our way home.

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:39.481
She was singing along to this
song that she loved on the radio.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:43.552
And she seemed so... so happy.

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.423
And then suddenly this...

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:52.561
this car appeared out of nowhere
and sideswiped us.

01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:54.429
It hit us hard
and knocked us off the road...

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:57.632
through a barrier
and into this lake.

01:03:57.634 --> 01:04:00.669
It all happened really fast.

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:07.576
But then time became so... slow.

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:13.048
It took us forever
to sink to the bottom.

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:19.588
I... I tried to pull her
out of the car...

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:26.528
and I couldn't because
she was... stuck.

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:37.539
So I... I told her...

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:42.878
about all these wonderful places
that we would see...

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.482
and the great things
that we would do.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:54.222
But, of course,
she couldn't hear me...

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:57.058
because she was...

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:03.431
dead.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:06.701
So I... I held her tight...

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:12.374
and I promised her
that I would never let her go.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:22.050
You see, it wasn't survival.

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:24.953
It was... it was fear.

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:27.455
When the car had filled up
with water...

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:30.959
I rolled down the window
and I...

01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:34.729
I swam to the surface.

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:39.000
And I... I let her go.

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:44.372
I shouldn't have done that.

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:48.677
No... I shouldn't
have done that.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.959
Come back to us, Mitchell.

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:07.028
And don't let us go.

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:29.617
Diver one locked out and set.

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:31.619
<i>ENGEL Slow your breathing.</i>

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:34.756
<i>I'll monitor your gas levels</i>
<i>for you here.</i>

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:36.758
Take it steady.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.194
Roger that.

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.729
Mitch, remember...

01:06:40.731 --> 01:06:42.497
<i>once you're above</i>
<i>the deep water currents...</i>

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:47.502
<i>go to the end of your umbilical
and only then release the beacon.</i>

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:51.606
Visibility's good.

01:06:58.047 --> 01:07:02.650
Currents are strong
but not too strong.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:12.627
Come on. Come on.

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:20.535
<i>How much left on the umbilical?</i>

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:23.038
You have another 25 feet to go.

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:29.310
<i>Wish I could just keep going.</i>

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:32.313
Don't even think about it.

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:34.616
It can't be that far.

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.718
You have to concentrate
on the situation.

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:46.294
<i>I'm at the end of my umbilical.</i>
All right, Mitch.

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:51.266
Hit the switch and come back
down, nice and easy.

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:57.505
I can't... I can't get a grip.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:08:01.076
<i>It's not turning on. The switch is...
</i> Take your time.

01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:04.746
Hang on.
I'll take my gloves off.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:08.349
Come on. Come on.

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:12.353
Mitch, you got it?
I just need to... just...

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:13.988
What? What is it?

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:16.457
<i>I got stung!</i> Are you okay?

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:21.629
Hundreds of jellyfish.
They're everywhere. Agh!

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:22.764
Mitch. <i> There are so many!</i>

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:26.167
<i>Oh, no, no. I lost the beacon!</i>
Can you see it?

01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:29.404
I must have lost the beacon
before I could activate it!

01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:31.573
I can't reach it! I gotta
disconnect my umbilical!

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:32.907
Mitch, no.
<i>There's no other way!</i>

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.809
If you do that,
you won't get back to the bell.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.444
There's no other way!

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.578
Mitch.

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:41.381
Mitch. No, Mitch.
You won't get back to the...

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:45.153
Mitch, talk to me.

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:50.191
Mitch!

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:09.277
<i>Oh, no.</i> Mitch, talk to me!

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.379
Talk to me!

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:14.349
Talk to me! Shit!

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:20.755
No. No, no, no, no.
Kid, cut the gas!

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.390
No, please! Cut the gas!

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:24.759
No. No, no, no, no, no!

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:27.295
He's wasting vital air!
Cut the gas!

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.464
He's using vital air!

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:32.066
I'm never gonna see my girl.
Cut the gas!

01:09:32.068 --> 01:09:34.202
I'm never gonna see my girl.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:37.839
Stop! Stop! Get up!
Get up! Get up!

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.241
Get up! Get up! Get up!

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:43.178
Keep it together! Get up!

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:50.285
Get off me! Get off me!

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:16.778
Carmel, you know, you truly
become more beautiful...

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:18.746
with every passing day...

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:21.349
and I wanted to grow old
by your side...

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:25.019
<i>sharing the years</i>
<i>and watching our boys together.</i>

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:26.688
It breaks my heart.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.857
But I'll always be at your
side if you need me.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:34.963
I love you. I love you all.

01:10:34.965 --> 01:10:38.766
Now and always, Pete.

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:05.426
If they don't come,
I don't wanna suffocate.

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:08.596
I don't wanna die in that way.

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:14.869
I want it to be quick.

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:19.340
I don't think I can
do it myself.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:49.804
<i>COMMANDER</i>
<i>Surface to bell. Come in. Over.</i>

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:54.409
Bell to surface. I read you.
Over.

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:57.645
<i>COMMANDER We've intercepted your beacon
which tells us you must be close.</i>

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:03.584
It's going to take at least an hour
for our divers to find you. Over.

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:06.220
It'll be too late. Over.

01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:11.659
<i>COMMANDER You need to do everything
you can to conserve oxygen. Over.</i>

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.629
We're gonna float the bell.
Over.

01:12:14.631 --> 01:12:16.397
Will it hold? Over.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:19.133
We don't have a choice,
Commander. Please be ready.

01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:23.037
<i>COMMANDER</i>
<i>Understood. Good luck. Over.</i>

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:31.612
Will it work?
We'll soon find out.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.390
I think she should float.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:57.638
Strap yourself in, kid.
Things could get rough.

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:17.592
Come on.

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:23.564
It's happening, Engel.
We're doing it, eh?

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:25.466
Yeah. Come on!

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.776
Come on! 250!

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:38.146
Come on.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.694
What's happened?

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:56.731
I think the umbilical
got caught.

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:02.870
Shit!

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.675
Oh, shit. Shit.

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:12.013
What does that mean?

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:15.983
We stay here
and we use the remaining gas...

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:19.153
or we use what we have
to swim to the surface.

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:25.126
I'll swim up, but...
swim up 170 feet?

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:35.236
One hat. Shit.

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:40.007
We have a predicament.
This is so fucked up.

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:43.144
It's a tough, tough dive, kid.

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:46.781
You've never gone below
30 meters, have you?

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:56.023
It's an almost impossible dive.

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:09.604
We need to accelerate
the decompression.

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:11.305
Once the umbilical plays out...

01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:15.576
the remaining distance will have
to be done in one single breath.

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:30.791
You think you can do it?

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:39.700
I'm diving?

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:43.938
It has to be you.
I almost died four hours ago.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.041
I wouldn't have a hope
in the water for that long.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:49.343
I'll adjust the partial
O2 from here.

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:50.745
Well, if you do that,
the whole bell will flood.

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:54.081
If I don't, we both die.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:54.949
Here.

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:58.819
When you reach
the end of the umbilical...

01:15:58.821 --> 01:16:02.390
detach and just do it,
don't over think it.

01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:04.559
You'll feel disorientated,
light-headed.

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:10.898
But just listen to my words. Focus
on my words and nothing else.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.832
Okay?

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:15.603
When you get to the surface,
activate this.

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:19.674
How can you know? Know what?

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:27.676
That you're not gonna make it.
I told you, my lungs are shot.

01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:34.522
You're gonna die anyway. What's the
difference, here or in the water?

01:16:34.524 --> 01:16:37.325
If I was you,
I'd take that risk.

01:16:37.327 --> 01:16:42.530
We don't have time
for this shit.

01:16:42.532 --> 01:16:43.364
Here.

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:46.300
You're sacrificing
your life for me.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:50.304
I can't live with that
unless I know why.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:55.676
I figure I owe someone.
It might as well be you.

01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:57.612
I need to know.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:17:01.349
When I swam to the surface,
I waited.

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:05.386
I waited for the driver
of the other car.

01:17:05.388 --> 01:17:09.357
I would have killed him
with my bare hands.

01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:12.493
And when I swam down
to check if he was dead...

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:18.532
I saw him, his kid,
strapped in the back.

01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:23.704
I could have saved him.
He died because of me.

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:31.112
Now go. Come on.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:39.787
<i>COMMANDER We're scanning the surface for you.
Teams are in the water. Over.</i>

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:41.756
Roger that, Commander.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:49.930
Remember what I told you, kid.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:51.966
Take it slow.

01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:57.672
Keep your movements
and breathing steady.

01:17:57.674 --> 01:17:59.740
Talk to me.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.377
Talk to me.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:07.748
Kid? <i> I hear you.</i>

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:11.952
Just keep going.

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:14.321
Concentrate.

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:18.693
Push through it.

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:21.495
Keep going. Keep going.

01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:26.367
<i>I can't do this. Yes, you can.</i>

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:31.972
Okay, you're gonna feel pain.

01:18:31.974 --> 01:18:34.642
<i>You're gonna feel pain</i>
<i>in your joints. That's okay.</i>

01:18:34.644 --> 01:18:37.712
You just need
to work yourself through it.

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:40.648
You're gonna feel as if your
body's about to explode.

01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:45.219
But you can get through it.
You can get through it. Kid?

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:50.558
Come on, kid.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.762
<i>My arms! My arms!</i>
<i>Can you hear me, kid?</i>

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:01.035
I'm scared. I'm scared.

01:19:01.037 --> 01:19:05.005
I know you're scared,
but you can do it!

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:08.175
You can do it! Come on!

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:11.312
You can do it, kid.
You can do it.

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:15.049
How much further?

01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:17.218
You've got about another 20 feet
on the umbilical...

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.421
and then you're almost home,
all right, kid?

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:22.056
I want you to empty
your lungs of air...

01:19:22.058 --> 01:19:24.391
and then I'm gonna
want you to detach.

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:26.060
I want you to get rid
of your hat.

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:28.162
You're gonna start feeling
like a lead weight...

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:30.531
when you get to the surface,
okay?

01:19:30.533 --> 01:19:31.665
Detach the hat now!

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:35.336
It won't detach!
I can't take it off!

01:19:35.338 --> 01:19:36.403
Detach!

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:23.117
I hope you're close.
I hope you're close, Commander.

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:34.562
Come on, kid. Come on, kid.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:43.204
Come on. Come on.

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:51.312
Got you, son! Hold on!

01:20:51.314 --> 01:20:54.381
Get on-board, quickly! Lift!

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:06.260
<i>COMMANDER</i>
<i>We've got him. We've got him!</i>

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:09.964
They've got him.
They've fucking got him.

01:21:09.966 --> 01:21:12.366
They've got him.

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:53.567
¶ I see my window open
The summer sun pours in.

01:21:54.110 --> 01:22:02.016
¶ I hear a Siren calling
a tune we used to sing.

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:07.888
¶ Walk out to hear the birdsong.

01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:12.660
<i>¶ Look back from where I came</i>

01:22:12.662 --> 01:22:18.565
¶ My tears
are tiny storm clouds.

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:22.403
¶ I'm dancing in the rain.

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:30.377
¶ Walk out to hear the birdsong.

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:35.883
<i>¶ Look back from where I came</i>

01:22:35.885 --> 01:22:41.655
¶ My tears
are tiny storm clouds.

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:46.160
¶ I'm dancing in the rain.

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:14.194
¶ All she ever wanted
was to see a satellite.

01:27:14.196 --> 01:27:20.601
<i>¶ She talked about its beauty</i>
<i>and the magic of its light</i>

01:27:20.603 --> 01:27:24.271
¶ She went on about the future.

01:27:24.273 --> 01:27:26.807
¶ And the endless games
he played.

01:27:26.809 --> 01:27:34.781
<i>¶ Like a wave forever cresting</i>
<i>her desire would not fade</i>

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:42.422
<i>¶ Throw it in the water</i>
<i>count the leaps and bounds</i>

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:48.428
¶ Hear the ripples thunder
causing havoc underground.

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:54.434
¶ Sink your teeth in gently
taste the blood you drew.

01:27:54.436 --> 01:28:01.308
<i>¶ Remark upon her beauty</i>
<i>for she's your perfect view</i>

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:08.915
<i>¶ Stillness overcame her every</i>
<i>thought and every whim</i>

01:28:08.917 --> 01:28:16.456
<i>¶ The future she had made was</i>
<i>never meant for her or him</i>

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:23.630
<i>¶ The satellite flew over but</i>
<i>she missed it all the same</i>

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:27.234
¶ As she whispered
from her row boat.

01:28:27.236 --> 01:28:32.372
¶ A prayer said in love's name.

01:28:32.374 --> 01:28:36.176
¶ Throw it in the water.

01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:38.745
<i>¶ Count the leaps and bounds</i>

01:28:38.747 --> 01:28:44.951
¶ Hear the ripples thunder
causing havoc underground.

01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:48.121
<i>¶ Sink your teeth in gently</i>

01:28:48.123 --> 01:28:50.924
<i>¶ Taste the blood you drew</i>

01:28:50.926 --> 01:28:58.031
<i>¶ Remark upon her beauty</i>
<i>for she's your perfect view</i>
