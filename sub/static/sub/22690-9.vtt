00:37.204 --> 00:38.288
Cinnamon coffee?

00:38.371 --> 00:41.416
I got the good stuff
from the spice shop on Atlantic.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.503
I look that bad?

00:45.962 --> 00:47.630
You look how you should look.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.471
Have you been sleeping?

00:56.639 --> 00:57.640
No.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.601
Let me write you a prescription.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.478
You know I hate that stuff, Mom.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.021
Rafi called for you again.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.648
Yeah?

01:06.524 --> 01:08.943
You tell him I'm bedridden?
Crippled with grief?

01:10.320 --> 01:13.906
I'm not telling him anything.
It's not my place. But, Dinah...

01:15.032 --> 01:18.786
as much as I approve of this,
it's not you.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.498
Talk to me at least.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.130
I can't stop thinking about it, Mom.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.758
What do you remember?

01:37.764 --> 01:39.015
There...

01:39.849 --> 01:42.310
There were bullets flying everywhere.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.730
And it's like that happened
in slow motion.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.981
When...

01:48.775 --> 01:50.485
When Sam was dying...

01:51.653 --> 01:54.614
that happened so fast, I couldn't stop it.

01:56.574 --> 02:00.995
And my brain keeps rewinding it
over and over again.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.457
And now you're wondering
what right you have to be alive.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.501
You can't answer that question.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.128
But it's normal to ask it.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.176
But blaming yourself
isn't helping you to get through this.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.142
His... His mom's asked me to speak
at his funeral.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.645
What am I supposed to say?

02:26.396 --> 02:30.107
That... That he died doing what he loved?
Well, that's a lie.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.404
That he wasn't alone at the end?
What the hell does it matter? He's dead.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.031
- Sweetheart...
- He believed in what I told him.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.951
He died for the truth.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.873
So do I tell the truth, or do I just
say things to make them all feel better?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.377
What do you need to tell them?

03:07.812 --> 03:10.315
- Anything?
- Same.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.526
She hasn't gotten out of that bed
since we got here.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.695
I think she's devastated.

03:15.778 --> 03:18.448
I don't think she had anything to do
with her partner's death.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.576
Tell you what. She's either dirty...

03:22.577 --> 03:24.746
or the woman is a total shit magnet.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.373
Why don't we just send her
a little encrypted e-mail...

03:27.999 --> 03:29.166
set up a meet?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.295
Remember the last time
you sent her an e-mail, right?

03:32.712 --> 03:33.630
You wound up dead.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.592
- Look, you agreed to contact her, right?
- Yes, I did.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.094
You acted like an asshole, and I agreed.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.431
If we're gonna do this,
we only got one shot.

03:44.932 --> 03:47.227
Treat her like a high-value target.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.187
I gotta take a leak.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.737
Oh, man.

05:44.552 --> 05:48.014
What you're looking at
is video taken by an employee

05:48.097 --> 05:51.851
of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
field office at the Wall Street pier.

05:53.102 --> 05:56.147
Two other explosions occurred
at the NYPD's 10th Precinct

05:56.230 --> 05:58.566
and the federal courthouse
in Foley Square.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.861
And we should say,
everyone in this video is alive,

06:01.944 --> 06:03.905
though some others were not so lucky.

06:03.988 --> 06:07.950
We are hearing several people
have been killed and dozens more injured.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.912
The FBI and the police department
are at the scenes...

06:10.995 --> 06:13.706
"If you do not,
I will know that you are one of them."

06:15.708 --> 06:17.919
"If you do not,
I will know you are one of them."

06:29.889 --> 06:33.309
"The United States government
has become a tyrannical force...

06:34.727 --> 06:38.022
using its power to persecute
teachers and citizens...

06:39.356 --> 06:41.734
trying them in a court like criminals

06:41.818 --> 06:45.947
for seeking to defend themselves
as the Constitution allows.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.581
They wanna take away our guns,
our freedom...

06:55.414 --> 06:58.460
and then we will be unable
to defend ourselves."

07:00.086 --> 07:03.423
"I have acted in defense
of our liberty and identity.

07:04.131 --> 07:07.009
I have acted for all of us,
to do what is right."

07:08.010 --> 07:09.386
This letter's from the bomber.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.598
- Sure sounds like it.
- Mm-hmm.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.517
And... And he sent it to you directly.
Did... Did you touch this?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.894
Well, yes, obviously,
until I realized what it was.

07:16.978 --> 07:20.565
Okay, so the first thing you wanna do is,
we're... we're gonna call the FBI.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.848
This letter may be the only evidence
of who this guy is,

07:22.900 --> 07:25.069
what he intends to do,
what his state of mind is.

07:25.152 --> 07:27.655
God, I don't know if I'm horrified
or excited.

07:27.739 --> 07:28.990
Maybe a little bit of both.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.801
Guess that makes me
just half a terrible person.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.952
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
This just got interesting.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.913
"You have championed
the common hero before, Miss Page.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.501
I believe you understand that sometimes
a man has to make a stand

07:39.584 --> 07:44.338
for what is right, what is true,
even if the law stands against him.

07:44.421 --> 07:46.257
I ask you in the name
of this country we love

07:46.340 --> 07:49.969
to print my words as a call to arms.
If you do not..."

07:50.052 --> 07:52.221
"If you do not,
I will know you're one of them..."

07:52.304 --> 07:55.307
"...and you and everyone
at your liberal paper will be on my list."

07:55.391 --> 07:58.645
- Then he writes...
- "Give me liberty..."

07:58.728 --> 08:00.522
"...liberty, or give me death."

08:00.605 --> 08:01.939
"...death."

08:02.023 --> 08:04.108
Ah, yes. Real original.

08:04.191 --> 08:07.403
Patrick Henry, one of our Founding Fathers
and a real anti-Federalist.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.365
Okay, so, yeah, not so excited.
He just threatened the entire paper.

08:11.448 --> 08:12.909
Yeah, well, I feel sick.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.078
That this guy thinks that I'd approve
of what he's done?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.997
That is the last thing that I meant.

08:19.206 --> 08:21.626
Look, what if we print the letter
and a reply?

08:21.709 --> 08:24.295
No, I wanna tell him and everyone else
how this makes me feel.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.463
Okay, well, that's not up to you or me.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.359
We have to see what the authorities think
is the best way to catch this guy.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.843
Surely that's making this public?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.671
Someone might know him,
might recognize his handwriting

08:33.721 --> 08:34.990
- or phrasing or...
- Yeah. Maybe.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.682
Just stop. Stop, okay? Don't...

08:37.308 --> 08:38.828
Don't do anything. Don't say anything.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.120
- Don't mention this...
- Ellison.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.784
...until we have official instructions...

08:41.854 --> 08:44.982
Ellison, we have an opportunity
to lead the debate on this.

08:47.318 --> 08:53.490
The Bulletin will publish an editorial
if the FBI okays it.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.036
Okay, but I wanna put my name on it.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.289
No, he wrote to me.
I'm not hiding behind the paper.

09:00.372 --> 09:03.125
That's dangerous.
I mean, he's already singled you out.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.586
Yes, he has.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.130
All right.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.343
All right, fine.
I'll say something to the FBI.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.106
You can start writing. I'll make the call.

09:14.178 --> 09:17.098
- Do not touch that!
- Of course.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.732

I hate as much as a goddamn bomb.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.200
Goddamn cowards.

09:38.202 --> 09:41.205
They think they're gonna scare people
into making them do what they want.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.332
They're wrong.

09:44.083 --> 09:48.963
It just pisses people off, you know,
brings them together, makes them stronger.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.632
New York doesn't forget.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.302
Whoever this is,
they're in for a world of shit.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.346
You know, if they bring Madani into work,
we might get our chance.

09:57.429 --> 09:58.430
Come on.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.850
Whole city's got its eyes open.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.812
Last thing we're gonna do
is go after a Homeland agent.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.150
What do you wanna do? Nothing?

10:09.233 --> 10:11.318
It's better than doing something stupid.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.539
How is it going out there?

10:24.248 --> 10:27.710
FBI and NYPD are running things
on the ground, and...

10:28.460 --> 10:30.087
we're working intelligence.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.131
How is Dinah?

10:33.841 --> 10:37.345
I'm not letting you talk to her.
She's a mess, Rafi.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.096
Gee, thanks.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.266
I'm okay.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.646
I'll be right down the hall.

10:55.571 --> 10:59.325
I want you to have
all the recovery time you need.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.994
But whatever you've done...

11:02.536 --> 11:05.456
you left that office completely unprepared
for these bombings.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.877
My SAC is out,
I have several dead agents...

11:11.337 --> 11:12.546
and I don't know why.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.007
You might not wanna know.

11:15.549 --> 11:18.552
Survivors say you refused
to name the target...

11:21.013 --> 11:23.682
and filed a false tactical plan.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.480
Have you identified the guys we killed?
Who they worked for?

11:29.563 --> 11:30.898
Were they government-affiliated?

11:30.982 --> 11:34.068
You need to answer the questions,
not ask them.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.737
Talk to me, Dinah.

11:44.411 --> 11:47.248
- You ever had a partner die on your watch?
- No.

11:47.331 --> 11:51.085
- No. You ever shot anyone, been shot at?
- You know I haven't.

11:51.168 --> 11:56.382
Every time I close my eyes,
I see Sam Stein's face staring up at me.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.679
He had this look when he was dying.

12:02.138 --> 12:06.142
He wasn't sad or scared.
He was... surprised.

12:07.684 --> 12:10.104
Like he couldn't believe
it was ending that way.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.817
I can't shake that look.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.366
What do you want me to say?

12:22.449 --> 12:26.245
That this has nothing to do
with Ahmad Zubair and Kandahar.

12:27.329 --> 12:31.375
That Sam Stein and the others
didn't die chasing your ghosts.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.505
I cannot protect you
if I don't know the truth.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.549
The truth?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.969
The truth is what brought us here.

12:43.512 --> 12:44.972
No one wanted to hear it.

12:54.148 --> 12:58.319
This bomber is intent
on spreading fear, but I'm not scared.

12:59.653 --> 13:03.199
I know this city will pull together
like it has so many times before.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.927
The Bulletin may have printed his words,

13:04.951 --> 13:07.036
but we've also given his letter
to the FBI,

13:07.119 --> 13:10.622
because we have faith in the institutions
that he seeks to destroy.

13:10.706 --> 13:14.543
"We must not tolerate those
who use violence to communicate.

13:14.626 --> 13:16.378
This man is not a patriot.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.548
He's a coward, a terrorist."

13:20.799 --> 13:24.887
Jesus Christ, Karen.
Why you goin' after him like this?

13:24.971 --> 13:29.183
- Well, we're about to find out.
- What are you talking about?

13:29.266 --> 13:31.894
Girlfriend's on the radio.

13:32.728 --> 13:33.812
Turn that up.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.859
Up next,
The Ricky Langtry Show.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.615
Good morning, New York.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.492
You are listening
to The Ricky Langtry Show,

13:46.575 --> 13:49.829
and I am your host, Ricky Langtry.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.707
We have two guests
on the show this morning.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.709
Senator Stan Ori,

13:55.792 --> 13:58.754
a vocal, long-standing proponent
of tougher gun control laws.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.047
Is that fair to say, Senator?

14:00.131 --> 14:03.509
Ricky, thanks for having me.
And yes, it certainly is.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.512
And we have Karen Page,
Bulletin journalist,

14:06.595 --> 14:09.140
to whom the bomber wrote personally.

14:09.974 --> 14:14.020
Karen, you responded with a pretty,
uh, pissy editorial this morning.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.106
You addressed this individual directly
by calling him...

14:17.189 --> 14:18.774
- You called him a terrorist?
- Mm-hmm.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.543
Do you have sympathy
with his point of view?

14:20.567 --> 14:21.986
Uh, no. None.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.655
The irony of this bomber's point of view
is terrifying.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.365
You're referring to the idea that...

14:26.448 --> 14:29.160
that he is using violence
to defend the second amendment?

14:29.243 --> 14:32.288
Yes, I am. We have
a killer committing murders in our midst

14:32.371 --> 14:35.875
to protest against efforts
to reduce the murder rate in this country.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.085
Well, that's your takeaway, Senator.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.754
I mean, uh, you know,
you are the gun control guy.

14:40.837 --> 14:43.632
Less guns, less death. That simple.

14:43.715 --> 14:46.385
This guy was using bombs, not guns.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.555
Could be some local hero with a hand gun
puts a cap in this guy's ass.

14:49.638 --> 14:53.725
You could even argue
that the right to put a cap in his ass

14:53.809 --> 14:57.146
is part of the foundation
that America was built upon.

14:57.229 --> 15:01.400
Ricky, really?
That was almost 300 years ago.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.736
Miss Page, wouldn't you agree that,
in this day and age,

15:04.820 --> 15:07.448
no ordinary citizen needs to carry a gun?

15:07.531 --> 15:09.533
You're barking up the wrong tree there.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.954
Have you ever been scared, Senator?

15:13.037 --> 15:16.248
Uh, genuinely afraid for your life?

15:16.332 --> 15:21.170
In a situation where a gun
and the willingness to use it

15:21.253 --> 15:24.381
might be the only difference
between living or dying?

15:24.465 --> 15:27.218
Guns are a toxin in our society.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.429
In the wrong hands,
they wreak terrible results.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.975
It's barely a year since this city
was terrorized by the Punisher.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.851
You know, uh,
that's hardly the same thing.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.604
Frank Castle killed murderers
and drug dealers.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.982
But where's the line, Karen?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.275
Frank Castle decided
he knew better than the law

15:43.359 --> 15:47.238
- and was tried for killing 37 people.
- Frank Castle's not a terrorist.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.032
- Thirty-seven?
- That they know about.

15:50.116 --> 15:55.329
Castle was a hero to many who felt
that he was doing what cops failed to do.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.916
Uh, hold it there, folks.
We'll be right back.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.543
Gotta pay some bills.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.588
Got a caller. Says it's him. The bomber.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.258
Uh, call the cops.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.541
Uh, give them the number.
Maybe they can trace the call.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.846
This just got interesting, huh, guys?

16:13.764 --> 16:15.766
- You both ready? All right.
- Mm-hmm.

16:17.809 --> 16:23.649
New York, we have a caller on the line
who claims to be the bomber himself.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.068
Can I get a name?

16:29.613 --> 16:31.365
No, my name is not important.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.617
Only my actions.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.828
You're talking to New York.
What do you wanna say?

16:36.912 --> 16:39.540
Why did you say those things
about me, Karen?

16:41.708 --> 16:44.086
Because I despise everything you've done.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.171
Ease up, Karen.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.507
This country is being cannibalized
by people like Senator Ori.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.385
Shipping our jobs overseas,
selling us out,

16:51.468 --> 16:54.055
then taking our guns
so we can't do anything about it.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.140
You're such a coward.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.186
Those people that you killed,
they weren't making policy.

17:00.269 --> 17:04.731
They were secretaries and janitors
and beat cops. Regular people.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.025
How does that help your cause?

17:06.650 --> 17:08.420
Maybe the government
did something awful to you.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.569
I don't know your story.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.339
But awful things happen
to people every day,

17:11.363 --> 17:13.042
and they don't murder people
because of it.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.876
You're just a pawn, like the rest of them.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.298
And Senator Ori, what a joke.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.134
You don't represent anyone but yourself.

17:32.218 --> 17:36.055
The war is just beginning,
and you are all on the wrong side of it.

17:39.015 --> 17:42.436
Sic semper tyrannis.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.626
New York, you're dealing...

17:48.650 --> 17:49.985
Wait. I've heard that before.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.862
- Yeah, in history class.
- No, no, no, no.

17:51.945 --> 17:52.988
I heard that...

17:54.240 --> 17:55.824
I heard that somewhere before.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.566
Where the fuck was it?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.081
It's...

18:03.082 --> 18:04.083
it's Curtis'...

18:06.210 --> 18:08.920
Curtis' group.
That kid, he... he said that.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.923
He said sic semper tyrannis.
He said that.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.610
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.303
How often you hear Latin?
Yeah, I'm sure about it. He...

18:17.053 --> 18:18.555
Curtis talked to me about that kid.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.849
He said he's always blaming others
for his problems.

18:20.932 --> 18:24.645
His name is... His name is Lewis,
and he drives a cab.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.356
- Lewis and he drives a...
- Could you find him on there?

18:29.733 --> 18:32.736
Lewis and he drives a cab?
That's not much to go on.

18:32.819 --> 18:34.696
Come on! He's a vet! I just...

18:34.780 --> 18:38.325
He's Army, all right?
He... He's white, 25 years old.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.869
He's definitely under 30 years old.
Could you just find him?

18:40.952 --> 18:44.099
That narrows it down. But listen, Frank,
are you sure that this is the same guy?

18:44.123 --> 18:47.293
I'm goddamn sure. Just...
Come on, David, just find him.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.088
Okay, what happens when I find him?

18:54.466 --> 18:55.801
What do you think happens?

18:56.427 --> 18:59.095
This piece of shit's
going after Karen.

19:00.972 --> 19:02.474
What's the deal with you two?

19:02.558 --> 19:05.311
The deal is just that nobody goes
after her, okay? Not on my watch.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.646
- You wanna go after this guy.
- You're goddamn right.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.314
What would you do if it was Sarah?

19:12.734 --> 19:15.237
If there was a maniac coming
after her, what would you do?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.448
Sarah's my wife. Sarah's my family.

19:18.865 --> 19:20.284
Listen to me. Listen.

19:20.992 --> 19:22.828
I'm only gonna say this once.
So is Karen.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.413
If something happens to her, I...

19:26.122 --> 19:27.499
- Just...
- Okay.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.127
Please.

19:33.839 --> 19:34.840
Thank you.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.681
Lewis, you need to call me.

19:42.764 --> 19:45.058
I heard the radio.
I've been to your place.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.482
I wanna stop this
before anyone else gets hurt.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.354
But you gotta call me, buddy, all right?

19:58.447 --> 19:59.531
O'Connor?

20:02.451 --> 20:03.744
O'Connor, you home?

20:25.599 --> 20:26.975
O'Connor, you home?

21:01.510 --> 21:03.136
You shouldn't be here, Curtis.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.641
I needed to come check on you.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.142
Huh.

21:10.852 --> 21:14.940
I figured, um, that you need some help.
You know, talk.

21:16.108 --> 21:20.445
There's a dead guy in that chair.
Seem like he's been there for a while.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.699
None of that matters... now.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.827
We could still figure this out.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.665
- It's not too late to do the right thing.
- Oh, I am doing the right thing.

21:36.295 --> 21:40.173
I can't leave here without you, buddy.
You know that, right?

21:42.551 --> 21:44.303
Right.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.558
You can't leave here.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.990
No, no, uh...

22:18.253 --> 22:19.463
Just stay down, Lewis!

23:12.641 --> 23:14.184
- Frank.
- Yeah?

23:14.267 --> 23:15.519
Lewis Wilson.

23:16.227 --> 23:19.940
Age 26, formerly 1st Infantry Division.

23:20.565 --> 23:24.027
Address is registered to Clay,
Lewis' father.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.029
- That's him.
- Look...

23:27.364 --> 23:29.616
why don't we just call
an anonymous tip line?

23:30.659 --> 23:33.620
- Frank, let's call Curtis.
- Nah.

23:34.370 --> 23:36.915
All right? Curtis knows the guy.
Let him deal with this.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.792
Curtis will just try to fix him.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.086
We're doing this my way.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.967
No arrests in the three deadly blasts

23:47.050 --> 23:49.177
that rocked Manhattan early Tuesday.

23:49.260 --> 23:52.097
The three devices referred to by the FBI
as homemade...

23:52.180 --> 23:53.974
He may have written you once before.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.726
Nothing sounds familiar?

23:55.809 --> 23:59.896
Uh, not that I can tell.
Um, we get a lot of angry letters, though.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.340
We might have some in the archives.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.526
Is it okay if I get this?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.027
- Be my guest.
- Thanks.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.282
Karen Page.

24:11.867 --> 24:15.286
The hell are you doing, Karen?
Going after a guy like this.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.788
Because he chose me.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.792
It made me angry that he thinks
I'd agree with his actions.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.085
Yeah, good for you.

24:22.168 --> 24:24.087
Now you got a target on your back.
You happy?

24:24.171 --> 24:27.757
What was I supposed to do? Nothing?
That's how people like this win, Fr...

24:29.259 --> 24:30.260
Why are you calling?

24:30.343 --> 24:32.596
- Is the FBI there?
- Yes.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.723
Good. You just stay put
till you hear from me.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.310
Oh, sorry, hold on a sec.
Could I get a little privacy?

24:38.769 --> 24:39.936
Sure.

24:46.484 --> 24:47.944
Why am I hearing from you?

24:49.362 --> 24:50.739
What do you know about this?

24:50.822 --> 24:54.117
Yeah, I know that you need to stay put
until this gets dealt with.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.871
- No, what does this have to do with you?
- Do you know who he is?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.001
Frank?

25:04.294 --> 25:05.754
If you do, tell me.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.607
I can go to the FBI,
and we can deal with this.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.800
Ah, it's faster my way.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.342
Faster? They're right here.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.146
Why don't we do this
the right way for once?

25:13.219 --> 25:14.888
Right way he doesn't walk away from.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.472
That makes you no different than him.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.350
Hey, Karen, we are plenty different,
and you know it.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.435
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:20.518 --> 25:23.564
Two guys don't like the way the world
works, so they do whatever they like?

25:24.480 --> 25:26.650
Do not do this and say that it's for me.

25:26.733 --> 25:27.984
Yeah, just stay put.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.076
Hey.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.579
Shouldn't you be out there?

25:38.662 --> 25:41.539
- Nobody wants me out there, believe me.
- Hmm.

25:46.502 --> 25:47.503
Hey, hey.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.507
Sex is not gonna make
your problems go away.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.888
Maybe I just wanted to feel
something good.

26:07.273 --> 26:10.110
Do you know that I've been to 17 funerals?

26:11.486 --> 26:13.905
Friends, guys that I served with.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.909
You think I don't know
what this feeling is like?

26:15.949 --> 26:17.868
Yeah, were any of them your fault?

26:17.951 --> 26:19.953
Yeah, if I wanted to go that way. Sure.

26:21.412 --> 26:24.708
Maybe if I'd shot this guy,
or stopped that guy.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.253
Been there a second sooner,
stayed a second later.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.088
So maybe.

26:31.297 --> 26:34.550
Or, shit, blame the enemy.
How about that?

26:36.678 --> 26:37.679
Sometimes...

26:40.598 --> 26:42.768
Sometimes it's the dead guy's fault.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.687
You ever think about that?

26:46.688 --> 26:47.939
While you're lying there?

26:49.983 --> 26:51.442
Maybe Stein screwed up.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.321
I mean, how'd he manage
to get himself stabbed

26:55.405 --> 26:56.782
when he was the one with the gun?

27:04.539 --> 27:07.292
It doesn't matter
if I'm out there or in here.

27:07.375 --> 27:10.796
Bad guys keep doing bad shit,
the world turns.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.131
You get back on the horse.
That's what people like us do.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.259
And there's a pretty big horse
for you to jump on the back of right now.

27:18.636 --> 27:19.930
If you can't do that...

27:21.514 --> 27:24.935
maybe it's time to call it a day.
There'd be no shame in it.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.563
Is that what you want?

27:33.401 --> 27:34.569
Permission to quit?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.988
Look, I can't go back,
even if I wanted to.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.741
Federal agents are dead,
and Stein died for nothing.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.994
As soon as everyone figures that out,
I'm finished.

27:47.665 --> 27:51.211
I... I used Frank Castle's name as bait.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.716
I went after the people trying
to kill a dead man.

27:55.799 --> 27:58.051
You see how crazy
that makes me look, right?

27:59.677 --> 28:01.387
You were just trying
to do the right thing.

28:01.471 --> 28:03.306
No one will give a shit.

28:04.557 --> 28:05.558
Yeah?

28:07.185 --> 28:08.520
Well, they weren't there.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.521
Neither were you.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.137
- Yeah?
- Hey, where are you?

28:42.220 --> 28:45.473
At the Wilsons'.
No sign of him or the old man.

28:45.556 --> 28:46.599
Listen, Frank...

28:47.642 --> 28:49.811
I've been thinking about what you said.
You're right.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.438
If you can do something about this guy,
you have to, you know?

28:52.522 --> 28:53.732
Even if I don't like it.

28:53.815 --> 28:57.235
What is this? You're giving me
permission I never asked for.

28:57.861 --> 29:00.864
You have to do whatever it takes
to take care of the people you love.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.866
What are you trying to tell me, David?

29:03.699 --> 29:07.954
Listen, I got a trace from Wilson's cell,
different address.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.373
He got a call about 30 minutes ago
from Curtis.

29:10.456 --> 29:12.000
Now Curtis is at the same address.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.669
- 83451 Van Buren.
- God damn it.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.425
Absolutely. None of my concern.

29:20.508 --> 29:23.178
My view of law enforcement
is let them do their jobs.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.764
What I'm proposing to do is twofold.

29:25.847 --> 29:29.059
Firstly, that we see that the victims
of this terrible event

29:29.142 --> 29:30.560
are looked after and...

29:31.311 --> 29:33.604
Exactly. And secondly, that...

29:34.480 --> 29:38.902
Yeah. Secondly, that we do not lose sight
of what drives this terrorist. He...

29:40.653 --> 29:41.780
I appreciate that.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.407
Your support will make all the difference.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.409
Yup. And thank you.

29:46.492 --> 29:48.995
He's in. Contact his office
for transfer of funds.

29:49.079 --> 29:52.999
And make sure his name is prominent
in the, uh, programs. Who's next?

29:53.083 --> 29:55.585
Mr. Russo, the security consultant,
is here.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.753
Ah, Mr. Russo.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.173
I'm Stan Ori. I hope we haven't kept you.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.633
Not at all.
It's a hive of activity around here.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.220
Yeah, I'm planning a fundraising gala here
at the hotel

30:05.303 --> 30:07.430
to benefit the victims of the bombings.

30:07.513 --> 30:08.932
Raise awareness on the issues.

30:09.015 --> 30:13.311
And a clear act of defiance
in the face of terrorism.

30:13.394 --> 30:15.980
Yeah, and setting yourself up
as this guy's enemy.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.899
I guess that's why I'm here.

30:20.318 --> 30:25.073
A, uh, friend in a high place
told me you were the best.

30:25.740 --> 30:26.950
Your friend was right.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.162
I'm interested. As a military man,

30:32.038 --> 30:33.915
what's your take on this terrorist?

30:33.998 --> 30:36.459
Professionally,
he's a threat to be neutralized.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.461
Personally...

30:39.504 --> 30:42.007
he's a murdering coward
I'd take out in the blink of an eye.

30:43.716 --> 30:48.054
And you... you don't worry
that violence begets violence?

30:48.972 --> 30:51.432
Senator, I make my living out of violence.

30:51.724 --> 30:52.976
And that doesn't bother you?

30:53.309 --> 30:55.520
Says the guy looking
to hire armed security.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.941
Listen, if we're gonna work together,
you need to start seeing us as insurance.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.943
If everything goes well, well...

31:02.027 --> 31:04.029
then you'll wonder
what the hell we're doing here.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.321
And if it doesn't...

31:06.948 --> 31:09.588
then we'll be the reason that you
get to keep having these debates.

31:11.953 --> 31:15.748
I am a prominent voice
in the anti-gun movement.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.044
If someone trying to attack me
gets shot in the head...

31:20.920 --> 31:22.714
you can see how that wouldn't look good.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.342
These principles of yours...

31:28.094 --> 31:29.679
they worth dying for?

31:33.849 --> 31:35.518
When can you start?

31:35.602 --> 31:39.564
Right away. Isaac and Simon will stay
while I organize the rest of your detail.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.567
And if this guy does come after you,
then...

31:43.401 --> 31:47.238
they'll do their best to subdue him
in a humane manner.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.536
Very dry, Mr. Russo.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.874
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.460
- You good?
- Yeah.

32:00.543 --> 32:01.586
Eyes on Ori.

32:48.883 --> 32:49.884
Curt?

33:06.942 --> 33:09.487
Hey.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.239
Hey.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.909
Hey, hey.
Hey, Curtis, look at me. It's me.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.038
Hey, you do not move, okay?
You stay still. You got that?

33:18.121 --> 33:21.624
You just stay still.

33:21.707 --> 33:24.377
Look at me. Look at me.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.629
Look at me. I got you. I got you.

33:26.712 --> 33:29.174
Come on. You're all right.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.592
There you go.

33:32.843 --> 33:33.844
All right.

33:34.637 --> 33:36.097
What happened here, Curt?

33:36.181 --> 33:37.640
I tried to stop him.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.394
Little bastard kicked my leg
out from under me.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.692
Back in the day, you know
I would have snapped him in two.

33:47.775 --> 33:49.652
I know you would, Curt.
Hey, I know you would.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.362
I know you would. You just...

33:52.363 --> 33:54.699
You... you be easy, okay? You just...

33:54.782 --> 33:55.991
Easy.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.537
Where you going?

33:59.620 --> 34:01.831
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna clean you up a bit.

34:02.415 --> 34:06.127
- See about getting you out of here.
- Hey, Frank, just get out of here. Call...

34:06.210 --> 34:08.254
Get out of here and call the cops, man.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.217
Come here.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.304
Come here. Hey, drink this. That's it.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.514
Go on.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.391
Good.

34:26.688 --> 34:29.359
He beat me. Beat me with my own leg.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.525
Come on, Curt.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.036
You remember that, uh...

34:41.704 --> 34:43.498
that EOD class we took?

34:44.581 --> 34:46.833
And what they said about Claymores?

34:46.917 --> 34:50.755
Seven hundred steel balls
comin' at you 1,000 meters per second.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.507
A lot of goddamn balls, huh?

35:02.808 --> 35:06.479
- What is that?
- My cell phone. In my pocket.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.106
My...

35:21.994 --> 35:25.540
You're supposed to be dead.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.874
This Lewis?

35:27.458 --> 35:28.668
And you're Frank Castle.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.504
They said that you were killed.

35:31.587 --> 35:33.798
Yeah, well, they say a lot of things, kid.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.676
I guess they needed you gone.

35:36.759 --> 35:38.969
Too many people were on your side.
People like me.

35:39.053 --> 35:44.016
People who know that we have to...
to take matters into our own hands.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.102
Is that what you're doing here, Lewis?
You...

35:47.061 --> 35:49.147
you taking matters into your own hands?

35:49.730 --> 35:51.441
Someone had to. Same as you.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.572
Kid, what does this have to do
with Curtis?

35:57.655 --> 36:00.908
Curtis...
Curtis chose the wrong side.

36:00.991 --> 36:03.536
No. No, you're wrong there.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.665
I promise you, he's never been
on the wrong side of anything in his life.

36:07.748 --> 36:10.126
Just... You gotta trust me on that one.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.879
Come on, Lewis.
What's the plan here, huh?

36:13.588 --> 36:15.173
I mean, how does this end?

36:15.256 --> 36:19.051
You gonna wait for the cops to show up?
You gonna blow them all to hell?

36:19.134 --> 36:21.011
You take on the establishment,
kid, that...

36:21.804 --> 36:22.847
that will not end well.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.515
They will find you and kill you

36:24.599 --> 36:26.279
before you ever make a dent,
I promise you.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.269
I already made a dent.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.775
Listen to me.
You need to let Curtis go, all right?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.611
You let me get him out of here...

36:37.528 --> 36:40.114
and then you turn yourself in, all right?
Just do it, yeah?

36:40.198 --> 36:41.741
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.619
- Is that what you did, Frank?
- What?

36:44.702 --> 36:47.121
No, you fought your war,
and now I am fighting mine.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.457
You are nothing like me.
You are nothing like me.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.167
People I went after,
I stood in front of 'em.

36:52.252 --> 36:55.004
I looked them in the eye
before I put 'em down. Not you.

36:55.087 --> 36:57.673
You're a coward.
You hide behind these goddamn bombs.

36:57.757 --> 37:01.552
You got a United States Marine here!
A United States Marine!

37:02.720 --> 37:04.722
You're nothing but shit on my shoe, you...

37:10.728 --> 37:13.981
You trying to get us killed?

37:17.860 --> 37:19.237
You decided to go?

37:20.988 --> 37:22.448
I owe it to Sam.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.372
When I first came to New York,
Sam's career was going nowhere.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.750
And then I came along.
I lit a fire under him,

37:32.833 --> 37:34.252
gave him something to chase.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.546
He trusted me.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.881
And he died for it.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.677
So, yeah, I'm gonna speak at the service.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.680
And I'm gonna tell the truth. All of it.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.558
It'll mean the end of my career.

37:48.641 --> 37:52.227
But the federal agents, the press,
someone will have to act on my words.

37:52.312 --> 37:53.604
They can't bury it then.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.816
Even if they bury me.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.610
Grand gesture.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.614
Yeah. The only one I have left.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.658
It's a dangerous time, Dinah.

38:06.576 --> 38:09.203
I want you to reflect on all this
before you act.

38:09.287 --> 38:13.082
Mom, the last thing I need to do
is spend another minute reflecting, okay?

38:13.916 --> 38:15.460
I understand your need.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.796
But if you do this,
there is no turning back.

38:19.880 --> 38:20.880
I know.

38:23.217 --> 38:26.596
All right, then.
But consider one question first.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.263
I wonder if, deep down,

38:28.348 --> 38:31.851
you want to burn all your bridges
because you're scared to return.

38:36.522 --> 38:40.568
Yeah, the thing I just can't figure out
is whether this is on a, uh,

38:40.651 --> 38:42.820
an open circuit or a closed.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.196
You know the difference?

38:45.239 --> 38:46.240
Uh...

38:47.325 --> 38:48.576
I think a, uh...

38:49.827 --> 38:53.163
a closed circuit means any wire I cut,
that's it.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.126
But open, some go boom, some don't.

38:57.209 --> 39:00.755
The problem is I just cannot figure out
which is which.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.008
So either way, we're screwed.

39:10.305 --> 39:13.058
You know, maybe what happens

39:13.142 --> 39:15.520
is supposed to happen,
and if we get in the way,

39:15.603 --> 39:17.688
same old shit's just gonna
come back around.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.608
Yeah, and maybe that kid hit you
a little bit too hard in the head.

39:20.691 --> 39:23.068
There's been plenty of times
I wished for it.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.821
Ah, come on.
That's bullshit, and you know it.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.985
You think I woke up in the hospital
with a missing leg, full of good thoughts?

39:35.247 --> 39:36.248
Hey.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.127
I'm proud of everything
that you've done since then.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.956
You didn't feel sorry for yourself.
You didn't wallow.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.465
You got on with it, yeah?

39:44.549 --> 39:47.092
You helped people, Curtis.
That's what you did.

39:47.176 --> 39:50.513
You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.

39:51.514 --> 39:54.600
'Cause every time I'm talking to them,
I'm talking to myself.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.520
You think I don't wake up screaming...

39:58.353 --> 40:00.147
thinkin' on what I used to be?

40:01.399 --> 40:02.608
Wish for it?

40:04.694 --> 40:07.905
Shit. I got my ass beat by a kid.

40:09.615 --> 40:10.866
It's not your fault.

40:14.244 --> 40:16.038
You ever feel helpless?

40:18.499 --> 40:19.500
I have.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.588
And I swore I'd never feel it again.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.799
But here I am.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.471
I'd rather I had died
in that last bomb than be...

40:32.012 --> 40:33.597
sat here, strapped to this one.

40:42.064 --> 40:43.065
Yeah.

40:46.694 --> 40:47.695
I called the cops.

40:48.278 --> 40:50.405
Okay. I figured you would.

40:50.490 --> 40:53.242
- I don't wanna hurt you, Frank.
- And why is that?

40:53.868 --> 40:55.285
You're not my enemy.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.665
We should be working together.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.712
If that's what you want, kid,
you got it. Just...

41:05.880 --> 41:08.674
You just tell me which one
of these wires to cut, yeah?

41:09.467 --> 41:13.679
You tell me how I get Curt out of here,
and, uh, I'll be right along.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.430
I don't know if I can trust you.

41:16.223 --> 41:20.520
Trust, it's... it's got nothing to do
with it, right? You can...

41:20.603 --> 41:22.772
You can trust someone,
they still let you down.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.236
Curtis ever tell you
about how he lost his leg?

41:29.319 --> 41:30.320
No.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.659
There was a, uh...

41:35.785 --> 41:37.703
There was an IED. It went off in a market.

41:37.787 --> 41:40.956
You know, it was a big one.
It was... It was bad, you know.

41:41.749 --> 41:44.835
Women, kids...
There's body parts everywhere.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.462
People screaming, you know.
It was... It was madness, you know.

41:47.547 --> 41:50.675
People were trying to make sense of it.
You know, all wild-eyed, but not...

41:52.927 --> 41:54.219
not Curt.

41:57.347 --> 41:58.808
He was cold as ice, you know.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.893
He was in the middle of it.
He was doing his job.

42:01.686 --> 42:04.104
He was... He was holding this kid...

42:05.064 --> 42:06.566
puttin' him back together.

42:07.733 --> 42:09.401
He was the best damn corpsman I ever saw.

42:11.821 --> 42:14.406
See, my job,
I was supposed to secure a perimeter.

42:18.285 --> 42:20.162
That's when I saw
this woman walking at us.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.195
She was 7, 8 months pregnant.
She was walking right at us.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.501
It wasn't even like that.

42:26.251 --> 42:28.754
It was.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.049
It was.

42:34.509 --> 42:35.553
I saw her.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.640
My job was to keep her away.

42:40.849 --> 42:42.810
The only problem, Lewis,
is when I looked at her,

42:42.893 --> 42:46.313
I saw my wife back home,
who was pregnant with my kid.

42:47.690 --> 42:49.942
I should have put her down, but I froze.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.778
I couldn't squeeze that trigger.

42:56.323 --> 42:58.075
And when she blew herself up...

42:59.827 --> 43:03.413
well, she killed that kid
that Curtis was working on.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.752
She blew off Curtis's leg, too.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.550
Now I dragged him out of there.

43:15.342 --> 43:18.304
He thanked me for saving his life,
but the truth is...

43:19.847 --> 43:21.140
I ruined it.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.327
Come to the back window, Frank.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.252
Yeah.

44:00.387 --> 44:02.222
Hear that?

44:02.306 --> 44:04.809
- They're coming?
- Yeah.

44:05.976 --> 44:07.227
Yeah, I hear it.

44:08.270 --> 44:10.230
But I'm gonna stay right here.

44:10.314 --> 44:12.482
Get out of here. Go!

44:13.484 --> 44:15.778
Frank, you son of a bitch, please!

44:16.403 --> 44:19.281
I don't give a damn about the past,
and you don't owe me anything.

44:19.364 --> 44:20.741
I am not leaving.

44:22.242 --> 44:23.953
Let me ask you a question, Lewis.

44:24.619 --> 44:25.871
Why'd you join up?

44:25.955 --> 44:29.041
- I wanted to serve my country.
- Come on.

44:29.124 --> 44:31.335
That's elementary school shit,
and you know it.

44:31.418 --> 44:33.021
Joined up because
you wanted to fight, right?

44:33.045 --> 44:35.047
You wanted a taste.
To get some. It's okay.

44:35.130 --> 44:38.092
Me, too. And now what you're doing
is you're using the flag, right?

44:38.175 --> 44:41.095
You use it to wipe off the shit
that you've done since you've been home.

44:41.178 --> 44:42.221
Home?

44:44.139 --> 44:45.140
Home?

44:46.266 --> 44:47.977
No, there is no home.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.020
Not as long as hacks like Karen Page

44:50.104 --> 44:52.857
think they can write or say
whatever it is they want.

44:52.940 --> 44:58.738
Or politicians like Ori sit
and attack real patriots, Frank.

44:59.989 --> 45:02.783
No, they are gonna learn
that they're not safe.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.702
Now I'm getting sick
of your goddamn voice, you know that?

45:05.786 --> 45:08.413
Now I'm gonna walk in there
and I'm gonna cut one of those wires.

45:08.497 --> 45:10.875
Now what are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, kid?

45:10.958 --> 45:13.836
You ready? You ready to kill me?

45:13.919 --> 45:16.213
You ready to kill Curtis?
Is that who you are?

45:16.296 --> 45:18.048
Decision's in your hands.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.885
- You decide how this goes!
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right. I do, Frank.

45:20.968 --> 45:23.387
Wow, you're a big man.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.556
Well, then go ahead, big man.
Make your decision!

45:27.516 --> 45:28.600
Are you ready?

45:29.393 --> 45:31.520
You wanna kill me? You wanna kill Curtis?

45:45.367 --> 45:46.869
Try the white wire.

45:56.753 --> 45:57.753
Hey...

45:58.463 --> 45:59.840
Hey, hey...

46:01.716 --> 46:03.385
Hey...

46:05.012 --> 46:08.807
Frank, no, what are you doing? Just go.
Frank, just go. Just go, man.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.017
Just... just go.

46:12.978 --> 46:15.605
- Frank, just go.
- Look at me. Hey.

46:16.857 --> 46:19.359
- Hey.
- Frank, just go.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.528
Hey. It's you and me, Curt.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.572
It's you and me.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.407
Come on. It's you and me.

46:43.759 --> 46:45.177
Stop right there!

46:45.511 --> 46:47.805
He's heading east, towards Pine Street!

47:36.103 --> 47:39.064
Freeze! NYPD!
Don't move, asshole!

47:39.148 --> 47:41.901
Hands on your head!
Down! Right now!

48:03.380 --> 48:05.132
You want another one, sweetie?

48:05.215 --> 48:07.217
No. I'm gonna be late. Thanks.

48:10.930 --> 48:12.056
Buy you a drink?

48:12.847 --> 48:14.349
Really not in the mood, buddy.

48:15.642 --> 48:17.519
Is that 'cause your partner's dead?

48:25.777 --> 48:26.903
Who are you?

48:28.572 --> 48:29.781
Call me Micro.

48:33.035 --> 48:35.412
- You sent me the video.
- Mm-hmm.

48:35.495 --> 48:37.206
Then a lot of people got killed.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.920
You're wondering
if I had something to do with that?

48:43.003 --> 48:44.004
Yeah.

48:44.838 --> 48:47.632
So Frank Castle turns up alive,
and now you're sitting here.

48:47.716 --> 48:49.176
No way that's a coincidence.

48:49.759 --> 48:52.221
So you... you and Castle, you're what?
Partners?

48:52.304 --> 48:54.223
Are you here to kill me?

48:54.306 --> 48:56.934
I'm here because I hope I'm right
and you're not one of 'em.

48:59.728 --> 49:02.088
You know what? Screw you
for thinking I'm part of that shit.

49:02.272 --> 49:04.149
You wanna shoot me, then go right ahead.

49:04.233 --> 49:07.987
There's a funeral I'd rather not attend,
so you'd be doing me a favor.

49:09.112 --> 49:12.074
I can give you the names
of everyone involved in Kandahar.

49:22.459 --> 49:25.170
Yeah, we're clear.

49:28.840 --> 49:31.926
The CIA operation
was off the books. It was, uh...

49:33.428 --> 49:34.428
totally illegal.

49:35.222 --> 49:39.268
The heroin was funding. Your guy Zubair,
he caught wind of it, and, uh...

49:39.893 --> 49:43.313
they painted him as a terrorist,
pulled him from his house, executed him.

49:45.399 --> 49:46.525
Have you got a name?

49:54.783 --> 49:55.992
William Rawlins.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.122
He was the interrogator. He ran it.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.167
And you can prove all this?

50:05.001 --> 50:07.962
Mmm. I still have the video files.

50:08.672 --> 50:10.090
But you need Frank.

50:11.133 --> 50:12.259
He was in the room.

50:14.803 --> 50:16.971
He doesn't know you're here, does he?

50:22.852 --> 50:25.147
Answer me one thing.
Did you know?

50:28.275 --> 50:31.153
An anonymous tip
led police to this house in Queens

50:31.236 --> 50:33.405
where Castle was fleeing the scene.

50:33.488 --> 50:35.383
- Did you know?
- Police were unable to apprehend Castle,

50:35.407 --> 50:38.202
but this image was caught
on a dashboard camera.

50:38.993 --> 50:41.163
Facial recognition software confirms...

50:41.246 --> 50:44.916
...that the man you are looking at
is indeed Frank Castle. He is alive.

50:44.999 --> 50:46.061
Early reports...

50:46.085 --> 50:47.877
- Hey, turn that up.
- ...of a casualty

50:47.961 --> 50:50.089
and police pursuit of a fleeing suspect.

50:50.172 --> 50:53.675
So far those reports are unconfirmed.
Stay tuned as this story develops.

50:53.758 --> 50:56.010
It appears Frank Castle,

50:56.095 --> 50:57.613
- also known as the Punisher...
- Shit!

50:57.637 --> 50:58.930
- Shit.
- ...is alive and may...

51:05.770 --> 51:09.608
Castle was tried
and convicted of the murders of 37 people,

51:09.691 --> 51:14.028
all of whom have ties to the city's most
notorious organized crime syndicates...

51:14.779 --> 51:17.866
We have breaking news
that Queens NYPD Police...

51:30.420 --> 51:32.088
Stay tuned as the story develops.
