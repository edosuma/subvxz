Oh, Ames, walking's a nightmare.

Yeah, Amy.

Okay, there we go.
Whoo!

00:26.854 --> 00:28.154

No, I do not got this, Terry!

02:32.379 --> 02:34.581
I told you, sir,
it would be far more effective

02:34.582 --> 02:37.517
for the squad to go to Vegas,
and you give us each $5,000.

backstage passes to Britney,

I took a Toastmasters class
to prepare for tonight.

04:07.374 --> 04:08.675
Seriously, it's gonna be fine.

04:08.676 --> 04:10.243
We're just gonna have
some dinner, eat dessert,

04:10.244 --> 04:11.744
play charades,
and then talk for half an hour

04:11.745 --> 04:13.145
about which of her friends
are sick.

04:13.147 --> 04:14.447
We're gonna play charades?

- Mom, seriously, the fire?
- It's fine.

Things don't burn down
like they used to.

04:41.942 --> 04:43.942
I'm just gonna put it out.

04:43.978 --> 04:46.679
Well, you know, it's good
enough for Diane Keaton.

now, anyway?

if you don't rein it in
a little bit,

05:01.695 --> 05:02.961
you're gonna scare them off.

about Carla, and I ignored it,

turned out to be drug addicts,

05:55.759 --> 05:57.894
did you have a nose ring
in high school?

Yes. Until it got infected
and I almost went blind.

Don't tell anyone.

have a binder,

06:27.491 --> 06:28.658
but you don't know her
like I do.

06:28.659 --> 06:30.526
She's too trusting
for her own good.

06:30.527 --> 06:32.694
She's fallen for more
Nigerian scams than Scully.

06:32.729 --> 06:35.030
She's fallen
for 20 Nigerian scams?

06:35.065 --> 06:36.332

That's insane.

[shrilly] Aah!

07:06.330 --> 07:08.697
Oh, I just spilled soup
on the cam!

07:08.732 --> 07:10.465
Why do you have soup
on a stakeout?

07:10.500 --> 07:12.335
Oh, no.
Crap!

07:12.336 --> 07:13.836
Oh, it's not turning back on.

07:13.837 --> 07:15.137
Do you think Sarge
is gonna be mad

07:15.138 --> 07:16.805
that I spilled "fuh" on the cam?

07:16.840 --> 07:18.174
He definitely will
if you say <i>pho</i> like that

07:18.175 --> 07:19.241
when you tell him.

07:19.276 --> 07:20.443
I'm not gonna mispronounce it.

Not while you're rolling.

I didn't go undercover

Crap!
I think he made me.

- Charles.

tonight's first puzzle.

08:12.863 --> 08:14.663
I forgot to send
the invitations.

08:14.698 --> 08:16.899

Sorry we're late.

three questions.

I had to talk to your parents
for, like, an hour,

10:30.634 --> 10:32.435
and I ran out of stuff
from the binder,

but she has no idea.

10:53.423 --> 10:55.157
She doesn't even know
that he cheated on her

10:55.158 --> 10:57.358

Sheila Bodden.

10:57.394 --> 10:58.394
Oh, my God.

10:59.563 --> 11:02.665
They were in our car

It's the whole reason I can't
have sex in cars in garages.

held you back?

Well, are we having sex
in car in a garage right now?

11:12.709 --> 11:14.777
No. So, yeah, big time
it's held me back.

11:14.778 --> 11:16.112
I never told her about it

'cause I didn't want
to crush her heart, but...

11:18.882 --> 11:20.716

he doesn't do the decent thing

11:23.153 --> 11:25.554

that you need to

- speak with her in private.
- About what?

11:41.925 --> 11:43.070

I'm not gonna say that.

11:49.378 --> 11:51.212
I drop the bomb during charades.

11:51.213 --> 11:54.616
I'll just tell him I know
about Sheila... with my body.

He's claiming the drugs
you seized in the bathroom

12:34.790 --> 12:36.457
- weren't his.
- What?

12:36.458 --> 12:38.459
But we saw him throw them
in the garbage.

12:38.460 --> 12:39.594
Yeah.

12:39.595 --> 12:41.562
Normally, it'd be your word
against his,

12:41.563 --> 12:44.464
but lucky for us,
you were wearing body cams!

12:44.500 --> 12:46.501
Yeah, but the thing
about cameras

12:46.502 --> 12:49.604
is that they don't really
tell the full objective truth.

12:49.605 --> 12:52.407
Images can be distorted.
People often seem naked.

12:52.408 --> 12:54.041

for a second in private?

13:41.724 --> 13:43.191
Yeah, that's right.
I saw you.

and I never told Mom about it,

13:52.568 --> 13:55.336
but I swear to you, I will
unless you leave right now.

13:55.337 --> 13:57.538

it's your favorite thing to do

13:57.539 --> 13:59.774
aside from humping it up
with ladies.

13:59.775 --> 14:02.877
You think I'm way more
sexually active than I am.

14:02.878 --> 14:05.278
I mean, I've only had sex
with, like, 400 women.

14:05.314 --> 14:06.314
What?

14:06.315 --> 14:07.482

Oh, my God.

14:07.483 --> 14:08.516

I don't want
to hurt your mother.

Please... don't tell her
about Sheila.

Fine, I won't, provided
you leave right now.

14:23.799 --> 14:26.900

contain... key number one!

Oh, Roger, you mean?

15:44.480 --> 15:46.280
He left very suddenly.

15:46.281 --> 15:49.416
Said something about
"being the worst."

15:49.451 --> 15:50.918
- What did you say to him, Jake?
- What?

15:50.919 --> 15:52.286
Why do you assume
that I said something?

15:52.287 --> 15:54.255
He's a leaving jerk,
so he left like a jerk.

15:54.256 --> 15:55.423
This is what he does.

15:55.424 --> 15:57.123
- He's not a monster.
- Yeah, well,

15:57.159 --> 15:58.725
you wouldn't say
that if you knew

15:58.760 --> 16:00.061
- everything that he's done.
- What did he do, Jake?

16:00.062 --> 16:01.596
Nothing.
You know, just, like

16:01.597 --> 16:03.764
super-awful
life-changing things.

16:03.765 --> 16:05.232
No follow-up questions.

16:05.267 --> 16:07.134
Is it worse than the time
he cheated on me

16:07.135 --> 16:09.212
with Sheila Bodden?

16:09.213 --> 16:10.213
Ah.

16:10.214 --> 16:11.213
You knew about that?

16:11.240 --> 16:12.273
Yeah.

16:12.274 --> 16:13.615
I knew about that.

16:22.402 --> 16:24.467
I can't believe
you knew about Sheila.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.971
I also knew about Wendy.

16:27.972 --> 16:29.238
And Bonnie.

16:29.273 --> 16:30.572
Bonnie who wears a wig?

16:30.608 --> 16:32.375
She left it in our bathroom.

16:32.376 --> 16:34.377
That's how I found out.

16:34.378 --> 16:37.380
And also, remember your turtle,
Graham Crackers?

16:37.381 --> 16:38.948
Dad had sex with my turtle?

16:38.949 --> 16:40.250
No, no, no, no, but he...

16:40.251 --> 16:42.085
he stepped on it
getting out of bed.

16:42.086 --> 16:43.353
But you said Graham Crackers

16:43.354 --> 16:45.255
got married
and moved in with his wife.

16:45.256 --> 16:47.624
How did I not know
any of this stuff?

16:47.625 --> 16:49.958
Well, because you were a kid,

16:49.994 --> 16:53.563
and kids don't actually know
a lot about their parents.

16:53.564 --> 16:58.702
Jake, I've dated a lot
of men in the last 20 years.

16:58.703 --> 17:00.603
- You have?
- A lot.

17:00.604 --> 17:02.739
Okay, you don't have to put
so much mustard on it.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.708
And I haven't met anyone I like.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.643
But I like your father.

17:06.644 --> 17:08.912
And I know he has been
a selfish jerk,

17:08.913 --> 17:10.914
but he really has changed.

17:10.915 --> 17:12.949
Last month
when I had bronchitis,

17:12.950 --> 17:17.186
he flew in on his day off
just to bring me soup.

17:17.188 --> 17:20.089
It was this weird Canadian soup.

17:20.090 --> 17:22.992
I-I think it was just
all cheese.

17:22.992 --> 17:24.928
But it was really nice.

17:24.929 --> 17:27.030
[sighs] Man, I feel stupid.

17:27.031 --> 17:28.330
I was just trying
to protect you,

17:28.332 --> 17:30.133
but I clearly
made everything worse.

17:30.134 --> 17:34.170
You have been protecting me
since you were a kid.

17:34.171 --> 17:37.507
Sometimes I think
you got so good at it,

17:37.508 --> 17:40.309
you decided to become a cop
and protect everyone.

17:40.344 --> 17:41.611
Oh, that's a cool thought,

17:41.612 --> 17:44.314
but I became a cop
because of "Die Hard."

17:44.315 --> 17:45.347
I love you.

17:45.383 --> 17:46.850
I love you, too, Mom.

I'm probably remembering

17:52.990 --> 17:55.258
a lot more nakedness
than there actually was.

17:55.259 --> 17:56.459
No, you're not.

17:56.460 --> 17:59.462
Also, no one's gonna see it
on that little TV.

17:59.463 --> 18:00.663
Great news.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.499
We were able to snag
the new flat screen.

that he had no narcotics on him.

where Mr. Tran threw the drugs

18:21.419 --> 18:23.685
in the trash right before
he was apprehended.

18:23.721 --> 18:24.821
At least it's over now.

Hey, man, look at
that and tell me what you see.

18:36.233 --> 18:37.700
A naked fool.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.903
No. Between the thighs

18:39.904 --> 18:42.905
and under the testicles,
there's a bag of cocaine.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.442
A bag of cocaine that's gonna
get us a conviction

18:45.443 --> 18:47.844
and prove the value
of body cams.

18:47.845 --> 18:50.380
You know what I see?
A naked hero.

19:01.892 --> 19:03.359
Right.

19:03.360 --> 19:08.331
Look, I talked to Mom,
and I just want her to be happy.

19:08.332 --> 19:10.533

my birthday party now?

19:10.534 --> 19:12.501
I'd love that, son.

19:14.705 --> 19:16.206
This is nice.

19:16.207 --> 19:18.374
If you screw this up
and hurt her in any way,

19:18.375 --> 19:20.276
I will throw you in jail
for the rest of your life,

19:20.277 --> 19:23.546
and I can do that now, Dad,
so do not test me.

19:23.547 --> 19:25.826
[clears throat] Okay.

to threaten me.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.890
