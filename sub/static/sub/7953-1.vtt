00:22.588 --> 00:25.708
First, you need to know
something about them.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.205
The beautiful ones.

00:27.468 --> 00:29.875
The flawless four.

00:30.596 --> 00:32.587
Everyone wanted to be them.

00:32.805 --> 00:35.130
You know them.
They went to your school too.

00:35.349 --> 00:38.220
They totally ruled.

00:38.477 --> 00:40.517
The one in green, that's Courtney.

00:40.729 --> 00:44.063
She was the leader.
She was like Satan in heels.

00:44.274 --> 00:47.808
The blonde, Marcie Fox,
a legend in her own little mind.

00:48.027 --> 00:49.936
Known to herself as Foxy.

00:50.196 --> 00:55.153
The one with the pigtails is Julie,
popular because of that face...

00:55.409 --> 00:59.738
...and because she was best friends
with the one in the pink.

00:59.997 --> 01:02.452
That's Liz Purr.

01:02.833 --> 01:05.120
She was special.

01:07.086 --> 01:08.877
Everybody loved Liz...

01:09.088 --> 01:13.086
...not just because she was beautiful
and popular and rich and smart.

01:13.343 --> 01:16.794
She was all of those things,
but more than anything...

01:17.013 --> 01:18.887
...she was sweet.

01:19.098 --> 01:22.964
Courtney ruled with terror,
but Liz ruled with kindness.

01:23.226 --> 01:26.013
She was like the Princess Di
of Reagan High...

01:26.271 --> 01:29.188
...and that pissed Courtney off.

01:29.774 --> 01:31.517
Liz Purr was just....

01:34.195 --> 01:36.732
Well, she was perfect.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.029
I used to dream about what
it would be like to be her...

01:41.284 --> 01:43.692
...Elizabeth Purr.

01:45.246 --> 01:48.282
It's a shame about
what happened to Liz.

01:48.499 --> 01:51.915
That was no way to wake up
on your 1 7th birthday.

02:23.614 --> 02:25.191
She is gonna die!

02:25.448 --> 02:29.493
-lt's much better than last year.
-l wish my friends did that for me.

02:29.702 --> 02:31.611
Yeah, right.
You'd have us killed.

02:31.871 --> 02:33.033
Only maimed, my dear.

02:33.289 --> 02:34.285
What're we gonna do?

02:34.540 --> 02:37.209
We'll stuff her pretty face
with pancakes...

02:37.460 --> 02:41.327
...tie her to the flagpole in
her undies and watch the fun begin.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.288
She is gonna die!

02:56.019 --> 02:57.299
Polaroid.

02:58.187 --> 03:00.724
Hey, birthday girl, rise and shine!

03:03.483 --> 03:05.061
-Who's doing the honours?
-Me.

03:05.277 --> 03:06.687
Aren't we anxious?

03:07.571 --> 03:09.278
One is for witch...

03:09.531 --> 03:11.322
...two is for bitch....

03:11.574 --> 03:13.199
Pop it, Marcie!

03:13.451 --> 03:14.825
Surprise!

03:16.119 --> 03:17.234
Oh, my God.

03:17.496 --> 03:19.572
What happened?
What's in her throat?

03:20.665 --> 03:21.579
Courtney?

03:27.422 --> 03:28.999
Oh, my God.

03:34.386 --> 03:36.010
Oh, my God.

03:36.263 --> 03:40.307
This is a joke, right?
lt's a total joke. Say it's a joke.

03:40.558 --> 03:42.302
lt was supposed to be for fun.

03:43.269 --> 03:46.472
-This isn't happening.
-l didn't want her to scream.

03:46.689 --> 03:49.013
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Liz!

03:49.274 --> 03:50.733
l thought a jawbreaker was funny.

03:52.569 --> 03:55.439
You gagged her with a jawbreaker?

06:29.670 --> 06:31.246
Call someone right now.

06:31.504 --> 06:33.793
-No way.
-Why not? lt was an accident.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.925
Oh, my God, did you hear that?

06:38.135 --> 06:41.219
-l think l'm gonna be sick.
-Sick?

06:42.723 --> 06:44.680
That's it. Liz is sick.

06:44.933 --> 06:45.882
She is dead.

06:46.143 --> 06:47.719
Does school know that?

06:47.935 --> 06:51.933
You cannot just call in sick for her.
We have to tell somebody.

06:52.189 --> 06:53.019
Liz is--

06:53.274 --> 06:55.432
Dead. Liz is dead.

06:55.651 --> 06:57.774
Do you have any idea what that means?

06:58.028 --> 06:59.403
You'll be prom queen?

06:59.655 --> 07:03.486
That is so not funny.
Our best friend is dead.

07:03.741 --> 07:05.449
People won't be pleased.

07:05.701 --> 07:06.816
But they'll understand.

07:07.077 --> 07:08.655
No. You understand.

07:08.913 --> 07:10.371
l am not getting fucked...

07:10.623 --> 07:14.205
...because l played a clever prank
for my friend's birthday.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.325
Give me the phone.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.550
Okay, who's got the motherly voice?

07:24.468 --> 07:27.385
No way!
l want nothing to do with this.

07:34.436 --> 07:36.309
Ms. Sherwood, please.

07:38.606 --> 07:42.188
Hi, Ms. Sherwood, this is Mrs. Purr,
Elizabeth's mother.

07:42.443 --> 07:45.563
l'm sorry, but Elizabeth
won't be in school today.

07:47.115 --> 07:49.154
l know, she's had a lot of absences...

07:49.408 --> 07:52.325
...but the poor dear woke up
with a blistering fever.

07:53.662 --> 07:56.449
Can you send one of her friends
with her assignments?

07:56.706 --> 07:58.995
Thank you ever so much.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.409
Have a nice day. Bye.

08:03.045 --> 08:03.959
That was really good.

08:05.923 --> 08:06.919
What do you mean?

08:07.174 --> 08:11.088
The way you imitated Liz's mom.
l'm just saying you're in control.

08:13.012 --> 08:14.175
l know.

08:19.810 --> 08:24.104
Reality check. Liz is in the trunk
of this car, and she is dead.

08:24.356 --> 08:26.562
That is a sad, fucked up thing.

08:26.774 --> 08:30.772
But you will walk into that school
and strut your shit down the hallway...

08:31.028 --> 08:33.484
...like everything is
peachy fucking keen.

08:33.739 --> 08:35.115
Get it?

08:35.323 --> 08:36.984
Julie?

08:37.201 --> 08:38.861
Whatever.

09:07.394 --> 09:08.805
All right, bitches, out.

09:09.063 --> 09:11.269
Move it, move it!

09:11.523 --> 09:13.479
That means you too, gusher.

09:16.736 --> 09:17.850
Come on.

09:24.494 --> 09:26.202
Hi, Fern.

09:27.872 --> 09:29.532
No, no, no, space cadet.

09:29.749 --> 09:32.453
Drinking fountain down the hall.

09:34.378 --> 09:36.085
l don't think l can do this.

09:36.797 --> 09:40.046
lt's just a day like any other day.

09:40.759 --> 09:42.668
What would we do on any other day?

09:43.720 --> 09:45.297
Pre-lunch touchups?

09:45.555 --> 09:47.463
That's right, Marcie.

09:48.765 --> 09:51.054
Take a long, hard look
in the mirror, girls.

09:53.603 --> 09:54.552
lt's beauty time.

10:04.446 --> 10:07.779
Hello, girls. Having a smoke?
A toke? Some dope?

10:07.991 --> 10:11.241
No loitering in the girl's room.
Trouble brews in this room.

10:11.453 --> 10:13.943
Not so fast.
Elizabeth is out today.

10:14.163 --> 10:18.113
Which one of you will stop by
my office to pick up her assignments?

10:18.376 --> 10:20.248
-Miss Shane?
-With pleasure.

10:20.502 --> 10:23.752
Excellent. Make it by three.
l have a pet to groom.

10:25.048 --> 10:26.162
And Miss Shane...

10:27.050 --> 10:31.510
...please cover your bosoms. This is
a learning institution, not a brothel.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.043
Do it yourself.

10:34.056 --> 10:35.882
Be nice, girls.

10:40.436 --> 10:42.096
'' Be nice, girls.''

10:42.355 --> 10:43.553
Nice is not enough.

10:43.815 --> 10:46.899
lf l was friends with everyone
because they're nice...

10:47.110 --> 10:50.229
...l'd have Noah's fucking Ark
in my phone book.

10:53.198 --> 10:56.401
Remember, everything is peachy keen.

10:56.659 --> 10:58.901
Peachy fucking keen.

10:59.495 --> 11:02.865
l know this a bit out of
our realm of comprehension.

11:03.125 --> 11:07.951
The delusion, the derangement,
the descent into madness.

11:08.170 --> 11:12.547
She says it herself,
''What's done cannot be undone.''

11:13.467 --> 11:16.219
l know this may be hard to understand.

11:16.470 --> 11:21.547
lt's not like your lives today,
what with your acne mask and corn dogs.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.305
Planet head.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.767
lt's nothing to laugh about.

11:27.980 --> 11:32.974
There was nothing fun and fancy free
for Shakespeare's tragic characters.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.316
In the Dark Ages...

11:35.570 --> 11:38.240
...knowledge of female anatomy...

11:38.490 --> 11:40.731
...was divulged through autopsy...

11:42.117 --> 11:43.528
...and execution.

11:43.827 --> 11:45.701
-Women deemed...
-Hey, baby.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.748
...criminal or demented were
put to death...

11:48.999 --> 11:52.617
...both on and off their menstrual flow.

11:53.670 --> 11:54.998
Then we crack the egg...

11:55.255 --> 11:58.836
...ever so gently,
but with ample force.

12:08.850 --> 12:11.886
Cool, you got a stillborn.

12:12.145 --> 12:14.101
Oh, nasty.

12:20.068 --> 12:21.396
Put her back in bed.

12:22.028 --> 12:23.688
We can't put her back in bed.

12:23.947 --> 12:27.861
-Why not?
-She's got a jawbreaker in her throat.

12:28.117 --> 12:30.690
We can get it out.
l've got eyelash curlers.

12:31.203 --> 12:34.868
Perfect. She was up late,
watching TV, sucking on a jawbreaker.

12:35.123 --> 12:39.287
Maybe she was practicing,
if you know what l mean, and swallowed.

12:42.173 --> 12:43.287
Wait a minute.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.008
Rape.

12:47.718 --> 12:49.877
They'll check to see if she was raped.

12:50.846 --> 12:53.053
Maybe Liz had a friend over.

12:53.307 --> 12:55.347
Mummy and Daddy's last night away.

12:55.559 --> 12:59.010
Maybe he's from school, maybe not.
But definitely into kink.

12:59.271 --> 13:01.429
He got a little rough, went too far.

13:01.690 --> 13:04.606
There's a fine line
between pleasure and pain.

13:04.859 --> 13:09.319
She screamed for help, but her screams
were muffled by the huge candy ball.

13:09.572 --> 13:10.485
She tried...

13:10.739 --> 13:14.322
...but there was nothing.
Only sugary, sweet death.

13:15.035 --> 13:18.783
Oh, my God. That, like,
totally gave me the chills.

13:19.038 --> 13:22.288
Nobody's gonna believe that.
There is no proof.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.534
They will because
it's their worst nightmare.

13:24.752 --> 13:29.497
Liz, the very picture of teenage
perfection, obliterated by perversion?

13:30.591 --> 13:32.299
You are sick, Courtney.

13:32.885 --> 13:35.635
Shit! l was supposed
to pick up Liz's homework.

13:35.886 --> 13:38.128
What if Ms. Sherwood took it?

13:38.389 --> 13:39.219
We kill her.

13:40.975 --> 13:43.548
Did you see her face?

13:45.062 --> 13:47.813
lt doesn't matter
that l have to get there.

13:51.650 --> 13:52.682
Ms. Sherwood?

13:54.153 --> 13:55.611
Hello, Fern.

13:56.322 --> 13:58.729
l wanted to know
if you were gonna chaperone...

13:58.949 --> 14:00.858
...the botany club's garden party.

14:01.118 --> 14:05.578
Yes, l am. Of course,
l wouldn't miss that for the world.

14:06.957 --> 14:11.249
You know, Fern, do you know
a senior named Elizabeth Purr?

14:11.460 --> 14:12.740
You mean the meow?

14:13.545 --> 14:14.459
Excuse me?

14:16.341 --> 14:18.666
Liz is the cat's meow.

14:21.095 --> 14:22.340
l'm sure she is.

14:22.597 --> 14:25.265
ln any case, the poor thing
is sick with the flu.

14:25.515 --> 14:28.599
Somebody has to take her
her assignments and Miss Shane--

14:28.852 --> 14:30.014
l could do it.

14:30.853 --> 14:31.719
You will?

14:31.979 --> 14:33.142
lt'd be an honour.

14:33.398 --> 14:35.639
Oh, thank you so much.

14:36.150 --> 14:37.728
Thank you.

14:41.112 --> 14:42.772
l didn't give her the address.

14:45.074 --> 14:47.114
Ms. Sherwood, wait!

14:54.834 --> 14:55.664
Miss Shane.

14:55.918 --> 14:58.490
l forgot to pick up Liz's homework.

14:58.753 --> 14:59.951
Yes, you were tardy.

15:00.213 --> 15:02.964
But, thankfully, Fern Mayo
stopped by my office.

15:03.216 --> 15:04.626
She's on her way.

15:04.884 --> 15:07.007
Mayonnaise?
Liz hates her.

15:08.471 --> 15:10.712
Hate is a very ugly word, Miss Fox.

15:10.973 --> 15:13.510
Fern Mayo
is a dependable young woman.

15:13.766 --> 15:17.764
She may not be pretty like you,
but she gives as well as receives.

15:18.020 --> 15:22.267
We could learn a thing or two
from the Fern Mayos, couldn't we?

15:25.945 --> 15:28.400
We have to get there before Mayo.

16:23.955 --> 16:27.039
That is no 1 05 pounds.

17:05.242 --> 17:08.278
God, she's so stiff.

17:08.912 --> 17:11.403
No more aerobics for this girl.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.161
Panties on or off?

17:13.708 --> 17:15.202
Rip them.

17:25.801 --> 17:30.179
Let's see. lf l were being choked,
l'd claw the sheets to smithereens.

17:31.057 --> 17:33.762
-Should we shred them?
-No time.

17:44.945 --> 17:46.356
Hi, Liz.

17:49.866 --> 17:52.488
My name's Fern Mayo.

17:52.911 --> 17:54.987
Like hold the mayo?

17:56.872 --> 17:58.781
You don't know me...

17:59.041 --> 18:00.749
...but l know you.

18:01.001 --> 18:02.281
Help me get her legs.

18:03.128 --> 18:04.836
What're you doing to me?

18:05.047 --> 18:07.004
-Oh, my God.
-What're you doing to me?

18:07.257 --> 18:10.875
l'm so sorry.
lt's from last year's prank.

18:11.136 --> 18:14.504
lt's one of those cards.
You push a button, record a greeting.

18:14.763 --> 18:16.886
-You open it--
-What're you doing to me?

18:17.140 --> 18:18.599
Oh, my God. Stop it!

18:18.850 --> 18:22.302
lt's like she's in here with us.
Alive.

18:22.562 --> 18:24.685
Let's just do this and get out.

18:25.732 --> 18:27.724
l love your hair.

18:28.651 --> 18:31.272
l love the way it shines.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.863
She looked at me.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.249
l swear to God, she looked at me.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.952
Her eyes are open.
She has to look somewhere.

18:52.797 --> 18:56.297
My God, Marcie, she's dead.
Relax.

19:19.655 --> 19:20.936
How's that?

19:21.198 --> 19:23.191
-Very natural.
-Thank you.

19:32.626 --> 19:33.824
Jules?

19:38.255 --> 19:40.212
l need your seal of approval here.

19:43.719 --> 19:46.471
Now come over here and check it out.

19:46.722 --> 19:49.972
-Does it look real?
-l can't do this. No!

19:50.725 --> 19:51.555
Did you hear that?

19:52.476 --> 19:54.516
You're being paranoid.
Will you relax?

19:54.770 --> 19:56.644
l killed Liz, the teen dream.

19:57.481 --> 19:58.940
Deal with it.

19:59.149 --> 20:00.643
l have to get out of here.

20:00.901 --> 20:02.181
What?

20:02.444 --> 20:03.607
What's wrong?

20:03.820 --> 20:05.979
You don't understand.
l'm not doing this.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.065
l don't want anything to do with this.

20:08.324 --> 20:10.115
lt's a little late for that.

20:10.326 --> 20:14.370
Please l want to go to the police,
tell them it was an accident.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.038
We didn't mean to kill her.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.537
The police will come
when her parents find her.

20:19.251 --> 20:20.164
She was raped.

20:20.377 --> 20:23.910
You can't just say that because
she's in bed with her legs spread.

20:24.171 --> 20:25.167
l can't believe this!

20:25.422 --> 20:29.206
l am looking after us. l am saving
your ass, and you shit on me.

20:29.468 --> 20:31.010
Go to hell, Courtney.

20:38.977 --> 20:40.636
You're Fern Mayo, right?

20:43.147 --> 20:45.305
l'm Courtney.
l don't think we've met...

20:45.524 --> 20:48.561
...what with the cruel politics
of high school.

20:50.113 --> 20:52.782
-May l introduce Marcie Fox?
-Foxy.

20:55.451 --> 20:58.486
Fern, l need you to be
completely honest with us.

20:58.745 --> 21:02.327
And l know you will be, because
you're an honest kind of gal.

21:02.582 --> 21:06.793
Tell us, did you hear anything?
And let's not lie.

21:07.044 --> 21:08.953
l have this gift.
l can smell a lie.

21:09.171 --> 21:10.796
Leave her alone, Courtney.

21:11.048 --> 21:14.630
Fern is a big girl, Julie.
She can speak for herself.

21:14.842 --> 21:17.001
Fern, come on,
l'm gonna take you home.

21:17.303 --> 21:18.334
Homework.

21:20.348 --> 21:22.387
l was sent with Liz's homework.

21:22.642 --> 21:24.017
lsn't that nice?

21:24.268 --> 21:25.431
And you heard us?

21:28.188 --> 21:29.682
No one's gonna hurt you.

21:29.939 --> 21:31.018
l don't know.

21:31.274 --> 21:32.388
She doesn't know.

21:32.650 --> 21:36.066
We're all girlfriends here.
lt's just between us.

21:36.487 --> 21:37.685
What do you know?

21:38.406 --> 21:40.731
She doesn't know anything.

21:40.991 --> 21:43.150
Come on, Fern.
Say what you heard.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.611
Come on, Fern.
What did you hear?

21:50.958 --> 21:52.583
Get her!

22:04.136 --> 22:05.132
Let her go.

22:05.388 --> 22:08.009
-Have a little scare, dear?
-Boo!

22:09.517 --> 22:13.680
l'll come clean because once
our boo-boo floats to the surface...

22:13.937 --> 22:17.306
...it'll all become clear
in that little head of yours, anyway.

22:17.565 --> 22:20.519
And we wouldn't want you
to do anything rash, would we?

22:21.861 --> 22:23.355
You knew Liz Purr, right?

22:23.904 --> 22:25.862
l know of her.

22:26.116 --> 22:29.615
Knew of her. Past tense.
She's dead, Fern. She died.

22:29.869 --> 22:33.320
But we've got a bit of a problem
because you know we did it.

22:33.539 --> 22:37.832
You heard us. That gives you
a little something called power.

22:38.043 --> 22:41.494
The power to tell. And you're
the kind of girl that tells.

22:41.713 --> 22:42.958
A tattletale.

22:43.715 --> 22:45.542
A rat.

22:48.136 --> 22:50.970
l know you.
l know all about you.

22:51.221 --> 22:54.471
You're the one that
the geeks won't dance with...

22:54.724 --> 22:59.137
...because they're at home
fucking old pervs in cyberspace.

22:59.395 --> 23:02.396
There's nothing to hide, Fern.
You're nothing.

23:02.607 --> 23:04.480
We're everything.

23:04.692 --> 23:07.229
You're the shadow, we're the sun.

23:07.444 --> 23:10.563
But l'm here to offer you
something you never dreamed of.

23:10.822 --> 23:15.365
Something that you were
never meant to be, but will be.

23:15.576 --> 23:17.154
Because today, my dear...

23:17.412 --> 23:21.030
...fate has decided that you are cool.

23:21.707 --> 23:23.913
We're gonna make you...

23:24.125 --> 23:25.999
...one of us.

23:26.711 --> 23:28.953
Beautiful, popular...

23:29.172 --> 23:31.164
...loved, feared.

23:31.883 --> 23:33.293
All you've ever dreamed of.

23:33.509 --> 23:35.632
lf, and only if...

23:36.220 --> 23:39.968
...you never, ever tell anyone
what you heard.

23:40.682 --> 23:41.880
Think of it.

23:42.141 --> 23:43.766
This is sick, Courtney.

23:44.018 --> 23:46.640
You don't own someone
by making them beautiful.

23:46.896 --> 23:48.687
A makeover can't hide the truth.

23:48.898 --> 23:52.267
Liz is gone, Fern.

23:54.028 --> 23:56.019
Take her place.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.654
You know you want it.

23:58.906 --> 24:02.110
Think about boys.
Think about prom.

24:02.368 --> 24:04.575
They'll be lining up for you.

24:04.788 --> 24:06.366
-Not with oil.
-But with drive.

24:06.623 --> 24:10.834
-Watch the eyes come alive.
-You as us.

24:11.044 --> 24:12.074
A dash of magenta.

24:12.294 --> 24:13.788
Lashes bold, black.

24:14.046 --> 24:16.038
X-rated gloss.

24:16.715 --> 24:20.001
-Hair frames the portrait.
-Some gilded.

24:20.218 --> 24:24.430
-Colour, the secret to not growing old.
-We cut, layer and curl.

24:24.681 --> 24:28.760
-For a look that is you.
-For the hair of a dead girl.

24:29.768 --> 24:31.725
-Lips full and dark.
-Lush.

24:31.979 --> 24:35.145
A fine line that traces
a deep, crimson heart.

24:35.399 --> 24:38.565
Rest now, sweetness.

24:39.861 --> 24:41.735
The beauty we molded...

24:41.988 --> 24:45.273
... from sheer misery.

25:43.669 --> 25:45.293
Elizabeth!

25:45.546 --> 25:47.372
Honey, we're home.

26:21.953 --> 26:22.818
Stand straight.

26:23.037 --> 26:25.113
-Stop shaking.
-l'm sorry.

26:25.539 --> 26:27.532
l still can't get over myself.

26:27.791 --> 26:28.871
Oh, fresh meat!

26:29.084 --> 26:32.453
To think, my 2nd-grade teacher said
l had no artistic potential.

26:32.713 --> 26:33.578
lt's like a dream.

26:33.797 --> 26:37.842
l made you and l'm God.
That's all you need to know.

26:40.844 --> 26:44.213
Oh, my God, Julie is sitting
with the body-art rejects.

26:44.431 --> 26:47.551
-ls she tweaking?
-lt's a beautiful thing.

26:47.809 --> 26:51.225
To make someone fall so far, so fast.

26:52.022 --> 26:54.228
Look what the kitty dragged in.

26:55.733 --> 26:57.393
You look really great, Fern.

26:57.609 --> 26:58.890
Thank you.

27:00.028 --> 27:03.195
l thought you should know
that Liz's parents came home.

27:03.782 --> 27:04.612
So?

27:05.242 --> 27:07.483
We should tell someone what happened.

27:08.119 --> 27:10.954
There's nothing to tell.
l made cocksure of that.

27:12.539 --> 27:13.654
What does that mean?

27:13.874 --> 27:16.199
Girls, why don't you run ahead?

27:17.878 --> 27:21.663
Listen, bitch, one word
and you're over. l mean that.

27:21.924 --> 27:23.798
l'm not scared of you anymore.

27:24.051 --> 27:26.127
We saw you.
We all know you did it.

27:26.387 --> 27:29.505
-No one will ever believe you.
-Ask Fern.

27:29.764 --> 27:30.795
Ask Marcie.

27:31.057 --> 27:33.726
We saw everything.

27:34.227 --> 27:35.851
Fucking liar!

27:36.103 --> 27:38.096
One word and you perish.

27:38.356 --> 27:40.016
l promise you that.

27:40.274 --> 27:41.389
Toodles!

27:51.200 --> 27:52.908
What are you doing?

27:53.160 --> 27:54.785
God! Tuna munch?

27:55.037 --> 27:56.116
But my mom always--

27:56.372 --> 27:59.242
We never eat at lunch.
Do you understand me?

27:59.458 --> 28:01.248
For some damn good reason we did...

28:01.501 --> 28:04.620
...we would never, ever eat
out of a brown paper bag.

28:04.921 --> 28:08.206
l don't care if there's
a culinary masterpiece in it.

28:08.466 --> 28:09.296
Get rid of it.

28:09.550 --> 28:10.830
Sorry.

28:11.719 --> 28:14.506
-lf l get a zit because of this--
-l'm sorry.

28:16.140 --> 28:18.974
l'd better never have kids.
l have zero patience.

28:20.226 --> 28:24.971
Don't think we're anorexic, we're not.
That's for the Karen Carpenter table.

28:25.189 --> 28:26.731
We're not stupid. We eat.

28:26.982 --> 28:30.647
And we eat well.
We just don't eat in public.

28:31.153 --> 28:34.651
We don't want people
judging us by what we eat.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.652
lt gives them ammo.
The only ones with ammo are us.

28:37.867 --> 28:39.906
Food's cool.
You need it to live.

28:40.161 --> 28:44.028
But the mere act of eating
invokes thoughts of digestion...

28:44.289 --> 28:45.665
...flatulation, defecation...

28:45.874 --> 28:49.491
...even, shall we say,
complexion defection.

28:49.752 --> 28:51.412
l'd never eat a greasy pizza.

28:51.670 --> 28:54.671
Not even in front of
the ultra-special students...

28:54.882 --> 28:59.461
...because they're associating that
greasy pizza with your shiny face.

28:59.721 --> 29:02.805
A zit, a blackhead,
a cluster of pores.

29:03.057 --> 29:05.014
lt's just another vexing stress.

29:05.268 --> 29:07.555
Life is hard enough
without added anxiety.

29:08.019 --> 29:10.557
So, are introductions in order?

29:10.814 --> 29:12.356
-Dane, this is--
-Vylette.

29:13.817 --> 29:14.647
Pretty name.

29:14.901 --> 29:18.021
-You're a transfer?
-Dane, let's not perplex her.

29:18.279 --> 29:22.192
She's had a trying morning
with the trauma of changing schools.

29:22.449 --> 29:26.696
Reagan's a whole new battlefield,
and we were on the subject of...

29:27.954 --> 29:29.448
...strategy.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.828
But come by a little later.

29:34.043 --> 29:36.997
l don't know about you,
but l could do with some kink.

29:37.421 --> 29:39.045
You got it, baby.

29:40.590 --> 29:42.915
-Nice meeting you--
-Vylette.

29:43.176 --> 29:45.133
Yeah, that.
See you, Foxy.

29:45.386 --> 29:47.178
Sit on it, Dane.

29:48.514 --> 29:50.092
Vylette?

29:52.435 --> 29:53.300
l like it.

29:53.561 --> 29:57.392
Thinking on your toes, a must
if you're going to rule the school.

29:57.605 --> 30:00.227
l was thinking, Fern.
lt's a plant, right?

30:00.483 --> 30:04.018
l don't know about you,
but l would much rather be a flower.

30:04.278 --> 30:05.523
A rose? Too obvious.

30:05.738 --> 30:08.359
Never send a rose unless
dyed black as a warning.

30:08.616 --> 30:10.110
And if one is sent to you...

30:10.367 --> 30:13.237
...destroy it and the sender.
Emotionally, of course.

30:13.494 --> 30:15.202
lt's not like we kill people.

30:18.458 --> 30:20.415
On purpose.

30:23.462 --> 30:24.292
Anyway...

30:25.005 --> 30:28.041
...you're extra fancy.
You're Vylette.

30:28.299 --> 30:30.671
My Vylette.

30:53.990 --> 30:54.986
May l help you?

30:55.242 --> 30:59.987
l'm Detective Vera Cruz. l need some
information about Elizabeth Purr.

31:02.873 --> 31:03.904
Oh, my.

31:11.589 --> 31:12.870
Julie!

31:14.092 --> 31:16.215
What are you doing
waiting for the bus?

31:16.469 --> 31:18.876
-Don't ask.
-What happened to your friends?

31:19.763 --> 31:22.088
l don't want to talk about it, Zach.

31:22.349 --> 31:24.341
Well, can l give you a lift?

31:33.150 --> 31:35.189
-Cool car.
-Thanks.

31:36.820 --> 31:39.358
You shined today.
You've got the look, the walk.

31:39.572 --> 31:43.736
But popularity is fleeting.
Trends change. lt's all about details.

31:43.952 --> 31:46.443
Pay attention to details.
Look at my nails.

31:46.704 --> 31:50.748
ln junior high, l wore only pink.
Now it makes me puke. So l change.

31:50.999 --> 31:54.000
Demented. Seriously,
the colour's called Demented.

31:54.252 --> 31:55.877
Mine? Decayed.

31:56.129 --> 31:58.999
Like Julie. Our friendship
with her is decayed.

31:59.257 --> 32:01.546
-Julie is over.
-Done and void.

32:02.301 --> 32:05.421
-ln two weeks, no one will know her.
-lncluding you.

32:05.637 --> 32:08.009
-From now on, you don't know her.
-Never knew her.

32:08.223 --> 32:10.050
She's like Fern Mayo.
A bad dream.

32:10.725 --> 32:12.100
Get it?

32:31.495 --> 32:33.902
Well, thanks for the lift.

32:34.164 --> 32:35.327
lt's no problem.

32:44.923 --> 32:47.794
So do you wanna, maybe,
call me sometime?

32:48.051 --> 32:49.510
l would love to.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.107
Well, bye.

33:58.741 --> 34:00.946
Mayo, please.
lt's a residence.

34:16.839 --> 34:18.831
Hi, it's me, Julie.

34:19.550 --> 34:21.092
Hi, Julie.

34:21.344 --> 34:23.668
l know you're not
supposed to talk to me.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.589
No, no. lt's okay.

34:25.848 --> 34:29.014
-This must be really weird for you.
-Yeah.

34:30.643 --> 34:32.885
l mean, knowing about
what happened to Liz...

34:33.146 --> 34:35.268
...and everything else.

34:39.819 --> 34:41.775
Do you remember 4th grade?

34:42.029 --> 34:45.279
-Fourth grade?
-Yeah, we used to have sleepovers.

34:45.532 --> 34:47.239
Remember my Holly Hobbie oven?

34:47.493 --> 34:52.070
Your parents wouldn't let you have one.
They were afraid of electrocution.

34:53.789 --> 34:55.616
We used to bake cakes together.

34:55.875 --> 34:59.125
God, they were the worst cakes.

35:05.758 --> 35:07.632
l'm scared, Fern.

35:08.552 --> 35:11.423
I'm really scared.

35:13.390 --> 35:17.803
lt's just weird
how time erases things.

35:18.979 --> 35:21.551
Time doesn't erase things.
People do that.

35:24.942 --> 35:26.436
People erase people.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.195
Can you hold on for a second?

35:34.744 --> 35:39.405
Never answer after one ring.
What were you thinking, Vylette?

35:39.664 --> 35:41.573
Are you on the other line?

35:41.833 --> 35:44.787
-No.
-Good. When l call, you listen.

35:45.003 --> 35:49.830
Even if your sister locks herself in
the freezer, Courtney is priority one.

35:50.091 --> 35:51.466
Get it?

36:21.953 --> 36:24.622
l brought you something sweet.

36:26.915 --> 36:29.666
-What is it?
-lt's called a Big Stick.

36:29.918 --> 36:31.910
A Big Stick?

36:32.128 --> 36:33.587
You want it?

36:33.796 --> 36:35.255
l want you.

36:35.506 --> 36:39.207
And l want you to suck the Big Stick.

36:39.885 --> 36:41.545
God, you are sick.

36:41.804 --> 36:43.842
l said l could do with a little kink.

36:44.097 --> 36:46.766
Now suck it and see
or get the hell out.

36:50.353 --> 36:51.930
Do you like it?

36:52.605 --> 36:54.016
lt's okay.

36:55.941 --> 36:59.227
There's nothing kinky
about ''okay,'' now, is there?

37:00.528 --> 37:04.228
Now l said, do you like it?

37:07.243 --> 37:08.868
Yeah, l like it.

37:09.121 --> 37:11.160
You're good at that.

37:11.414 --> 37:12.612
l'm good at many things.

37:12.874 --> 37:15.330
That's right.
You are on the wrestling team.

37:15.585 --> 37:17.043
Hey, fuck you.

37:19.546 --> 37:24.255
Now, right about now,
l could get really hot.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.169
And l mean...

37:26.428 --> 37:27.803
...hot.

37:28.430 --> 37:30.921
You know what l like to do
when l get hot?

37:31.141 --> 37:33.844
Oh, yeah, baby.

37:34.101 --> 37:35.511
l want to, Dane.

37:35.727 --> 37:38.348
l want to real bad.

37:38.605 --> 37:40.514
The problem is l forgot how.

37:41.816 --> 37:42.646
What?

37:42.901 --> 37:46.768
But if you could just show me....

37:55.620 --> 37:56.569
How's that?

37:56.955 --> 37:58.663
That's good.

38:09.799 --> 38:11.673
l better get that.

38:12.302 --> 38:13.416
Don't go.

38:14.804 --> 38:16.179
Don't come.

38:24.396 --> 38:25.771
Are you Courtney Shane?

38:26.773 --> 38:28.053
Maybe.

38:29.943 --> 38:31.520
Dad, don't be a dick.

38:31.778 --> 38:33.272
What did you say?

38:33.488 --> 38:36.441
Another lecture
on the ugliness of profanity?

38:36.699 --> 38:40.398
l just wish you could hear yourself.
You sound uneducated.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.487
-Dad.
-And you know what?

38:42.745 --> 38:44.074
lt reflects on your parents.

38:44.289 --> 38:45.487
Parent.

38:45.749 --> 38:47.991
That's right.
l'm the mom and the dad.

38:48.252 --> 38:49.497
Whatever.

38:50.254 --> 38:51.997
l watched Oprah today.

38:52.756 --> 38:54.379
That's the mom in you.

38:54.632 --> 38:55.711
You know the topic?

38:55.925 --> 38:57.205
'' Club Kids''?

38:57.468 --> 39:00.552
No, it was '' ls Your Child a Follower?''

39:01.597 --> 39:03.885
-l'm done. Can l go?
-And you know what?

39:04.141 --> 39:07.759
l was deeply concerned because,
yes, my child is a follower.

39:07.978 --> 39:11.511
You are so lame.
You don't even have any friends.

39:11.772 --> 39:14.726
Whatever happened to
my sweet little Brownie?

39:14.984 --> 39:16.643
My Girl Scout?

39:16.860 --> 39:19.398
You remember the Tiffany concert?

39:19.613 --> 39:21.689
You loved Tiffany.

39:21.948 --> 39:23.359
I think we're alone now

39:23.617 --> 39:25.159
Oh, my God.

39:25.410 --> 39:28.742
It doesn't seem
to be anyone around

39:28.996 --> 39:30.407
Thank God!

40:44.190 --> 40:45.933
Nice to meet you, Courtney.

40:46.191 --> 40:48.860
l'm Detective Cruz.
You can call me Vera.

40:49.110 --> 40:51.316
Okay. Vera.

40:51.737 --> 40:53.445
So you're Liz's best bud?

40:55.032 --> 40:57.903
-You went to school that day?
-Of course.

40:58.160 --> 41:00.283
-Did you try calling her?
-Why?

41:00.537 --> 41:02.162
Your friend is not at school.

41:03.248 --> 41:04.114
Depends.

41:04.916 --> 41:08.284
Let me ask you this.
Did you call in sick for Liz?

41:08.544 --> 41:10.584
-Did l what?
-Did you call in sick for Liz?

41:10.838 --> 41:12.166
Of course not.

41:12.423 --> 41:14.000
Did it shock you?

41:14.216 --> 41:15.794
-Her death.
-Not personally.

41:16.051 --> 41:17.380
Getting used to the idea?

41:17.636 --> 41:19.759
l guess you could say that.

41:20.472 --> 41:23.044
Do you know who was
with Liz that night?

41:23.307 --> 41:25.347
Come on, who was the lucky guy?

41:25.601 --> 41:26.514
What?

41:26.769 --> 41:28.975
-Who was she fucking?
-No one.

41:33.108 --> 41:34.733
Seen one of these before?

41:39.864 --> 41:42.983
Take a lot of licks
to get one of these down.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.575
Wanna give it a whirl?

41:45.702 --> 41:47.280
No, thank you.

41:51.416 --> 41:52.330
lt's hard.

41:54.543 --> 41:55.373
Like a rock.

41:56.837 --> 41:58.830
T minus ten, nine, eight....

41:59.048 --> 42:00.707
Jawbreaker.

42:02.343 --> 42:04.466
The name says it all.

42:05.304 --> 42:07.380
It'll break yourjaw.

42:24.196 --> 42:26.521
Fucked up name for candy,
don't you think?

42:32.370 --> 42:35.324
Good morning, Reagan High.

42:35.832 --> 42:39.959
It is with deep dismay
and sincere regret...

42:40.211 --> 42:43.460
... that I inform you
that Elizabeth Purr...

42:43.713 --> 42:47.248
...a well-known senior
at Reagan High School...

42:47.508 --> 42:50.046
... was found dead in her home...

42:50.303 --> 42:55.130
...apparently suffering
from acute asphyxiation.

42:55.975 --> 42:59.556
There will be a memorial service
held for Elizabeth...

42:59.811 --> 43:04.722
... tomorrow at two o'clock
at Cloverdale Lawn Rest Home.

43:04.941 --> 43:06.269
And students...

43:06.526 --> 43:09.811
...Mr. Murk, our guidance counselor,
will be available...

43:10.071 --> 43:13.819
... for those of you
suffering from distress.

43:14.074 --> 43:16.825
My thoughts are with you.

43:38.387 --> 43:43.133
Tragic. A beautiful, charismatic
girl like Elizabeth Purr...

43:43.393 --> 43:47.521
...struck down by fate.
l still can't believe it.

43:48.063 --> 43:50.186
You said her mama
called in sick for her.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.148
Yes, sick.

43:52.359 --> 43:54.435
She said Elizabeth had the flu.

43:54.653 --> 43:56.562
Her mama didn't make that call.

43:56.821 --> 43:58.731
Oh, no.

43:59.240 --> 44:04.197
lt could have been anybody.
lt could've been a sex-crazed maniac.

44:04.453 --> 44:08.118
lf l had anything to do with her
demise, l don't know what l'll do.

44:08.373 --> 44:10.247
lt'll be all right.

44:10.458 --> 44:12.665
A neighbour said she saw...

44:12.919 --> 44:17.213
...a girl with schoolbooks come up
to the house at 3:30 that day.

44:17.882 --> 44:19.424
Yes. Miss Shane.

44:19.676 --> 44:22.426
l sent Miss Shane home
with her assignments.

44:22.677 --> 44:24.053
Was it Courtney Shane?

44:24.304 --> 44:25.928
Yes. No.

44:26.306 --> 44:29.057
Miss Shane was tardy, as usual...

44:29.267 --> 44:33.893
...and Fern Mayo was in my office,
so l sent her with the assignments.

44:34.147 --> 44:35.938
She is such a nice girl.

44:36.190 --> 44:38.229
-Mayo?
-Yes.

44:38.483 --> 44:40.476
ls that M-A-Y-O?

44:40.735 --> 44:42.527
Fern Mayo.

44:42.779 --> 44:47.571
Come to think of it, Miss Mayo
has been absent for several days.

44:48.368 --> 44:51.487
You don't think that
Miss Mayo could have....

44:53.455 --> 44:57.951
No. Miss Mayo is as sweet
as the days are long.

44:59.210 --> 45:01.286
lt's a crazy world, Ms. Sherwood.

45:01.546 --> 45:05.460
Some of the sweetest candies
are as sour as death inside.

45:11.971 --> 45:14.213
Hey! You're Vylette, right?

45:14.432 --> 45:16.341
l'm Brenda, Chad's girlfriend.

45:16.601 --> 45:20.469
l don't think we've met.
Oh, God, l just love your hair!

45:23.608 --> 45:26.941
We heard you were the last person
to see Liz Purr alive.

45:27.153 --> 45:29.643
That is so cool!

45:30.572 --> 45:32.364
Well, bye.

45:33.450 --> 45:37.317
-Oh, look, you have groupies.
-l know. Aren't they cute?

45:38.038 --> 45:41.371
-Now about boys. You need one.
-Only one?

45:41.583 --> 45:43.871
One to start.
We don't want to baffle her.

45:44.126 --> 45:45.537
So what turns you on?

45:45.794 --> 45:47.586
Marcie likes a nice...

45:47.838 --> 45:50.958
...round ass, don't you, Marcie?

45:51.425 --> 45:52.456
Good morning, Vera.

45:52.801 --> 45:53.916
Miss Shane.

45:55.387 --> 45:59.170
l like cheekbones. You know,
a boy with a little Bowie going on.

45:59.431 --> 46:00.510
What do you like?

46:00.766 --> 46:02.593
l've always been partial to--

46:02.810 --> 46:04.434
Darling, spare us the details.

46:04.686 --> 46:06.346
Meet your teen dream.

46:06.772 --> 46:09.856
Vylette, this is Zach Tartak.

46:10.066 --> 46:12.059
-That's him?
-You don't think he's cute?

46:12.319 --> 46:14.145
Most girls go crazy over him.

46:14.404 --> 46:17.154
He's in drama so we can't
guarantee hetero status.

46:17.406 --> 46:20.075
lt doesn't matter.
He is beyond fine.

46:20.283 --> 46:23.902
-Ultra-pretty.
-Unapproachable. Always in rehearsal.

46:24.162 --> 46:26.320
When he's not,
he's with the drama crowd.

46:26.581 --> 46:27.577
Can you say...

46:27.791 --> 46:29.071
...''freak''?

46:30.585 --> 46:33.869
The sure way to meet him is
to star in the school play.

46:35.464 --> 46:38.583
Relax.
lt's high school, not Broadway.

46:42.512 --> 46:44.635
Do you smell something?

46:45.598 --> 46:46.547
Hi, Fern.

46:47.225 --> 46:49.133
l don't know a Fern.

46:49.393 --> 46:50.970
There is no Fern.

46:51.186 --> 46:52.846
lt's Vylette.

46:54.564 --> 46:56.723
My name's Vylette.

46:56.984 --> 46:58.478
-Learn it.
-Live it.

46:58.736 --> 47:00.064
Love it.

47:01.071 --> 47:02.649
Ladies.

47:18.962 --> 47:21.203
-Sorry l'm late.
-lt's okay.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.296
This just hasn't been my day.

47:23.549 --> 47:27.048
lf you want to be
alone tonight, l understand.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.969
That's what l would want.

47:29.221 --> 47:30.763
No, it's okay.

47:36.061 --> 47:38.930
Liz was the only one
that meant anything to me.

47:39.855 --> 47:43.022
With Courtney and Marcie
it was all games.

47:43.275 --> 47:44.983
lt was total bullshit.

47:46.862 --> 47:49.779
lmagine what it looked like
from the outside.

47:50.407 --> 47:51.652
God!

47:52.576 --> 47:54.900
lt was a total sideshow, Zach.

47:56.453 --> 48:00.581
You ever get the feeling that
this is one of those things...

48:00.833 --> 48:02.113
...that shouldn't happen?

48:02.334 --> 48:03.662
What do you mean?

48:05.921 --> 48:07.878
You were the kind of girl...

48:08.090 --> 48:10.414
...that didn't give the time
of day to anybody.

48:10.716 --> 48:14.666
But when l saw you that day waiting
for the bus, it was like l knew.

48:15.429 --> 48:18.098
You were alone and
weren't with them anymore.

48:18.807 --> 48:21.891
l mean, l would've never
thought to approach you.

48:22.394 --> 48:23.805
l've seen you.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.846
l've seen you see me.

48:27.106 --> 48:29.394
l wouldn't have gone there.
No way.

48:30.943 --> 48:32.223
Why not?

48:34.906 --> 48:36.898
l mean, l liked you.

48:40.953 --> 48:42.577
l want to show you something.

48:44.414 --> 48:45.279
Come on.

49:06.934 --> 49:09.639
lt's so beautiful up here.

49:09.895 --> 49:13.395
This is where l come when
l don't want anyone to find me.

49:14.649 --> 49:16.938
Now l can find you.

49:24.867 --> 49:26.907
-lt's hard to track you down, Fern.
-Vylette.

49:27.453 --> 49:29.908
My name's Vylette.
Fern was a childhood name...

49:30.122 --> 49:33.704
...but now, as a senior,
Vylette seems more appropriate.

49:34.834 --> 49:36.743
Can we keep that between us?

49:37.253 --> 49:38.795
Of course.

49:41.173 --> 49:45.087
Now, Ms. Sherwood says you took
Liz's assignments to her home.

49:46.261 --> 49:47.885
Would you tell me about that?

49:48.096 --> 49:51.429
Liz and l never officially met.

49:52.224 --> 49:54.550
Well, we kind of met.

49:56.103 --> 49:58.309
I had a term paper due.

50:00.065 --> 50:02.272
And I was late for class.

50:06.195 --> 50:09.694
It was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

50:09.907 --> 50:11.449
So you two became friends?

50:11.701 --> 50:14.786
We had a class together.
Algebra. l sat behind her.

50:16.289 --> 50:19.290
She's got this shiny hair, you know?

50:19.542 --> 50:21.249
It smells like apples.

50:22.294 --> 50:24.832
I'd sit there,
staring at her from behind.

50:25.088 --> 50:28.789
She has this cluster of beauty marks
on the back of her neck.

50:29.009 --> 50:30.716
I know this sounds weird...

50:30.927 --> 50:35.221
...but they were in
the most fascinating patterns.

50:36.015 --> 50:39.383
Like a puzzle waiting
to be solved, a Rubik's cube...

50:39.601 --> 50:41.724
...an uncharted constellation.

50:43.021 --> 50:46.686
So that's what l'd do.
l'd stare at the back of her neck...

50:46.900 --> 50:48.976
...playing connect-the-dots.

50:51.154 --> 50:55.482
I've found salmon swimming upstream
on the back of that neck.

50:55.740 --> 50:57.733
Spider webs...

50:58.243 --> 51:01.078
...sea monkeys even.
And the bell would ring...

51:01.287 --> 51:03.576
...and she'd be the first one out.

51:03.790 --> 51:06.707
And l'd be stuck there,
sitting with all these...

51:06.918 --> 51:09.871
...salmon and sea monkeys
dancing in my head.

51:12.172 --> 51:13.582
Very interesting.

51:14.716 --> 51:17.254
So l guess Liz was a hero to you?

51:17.510 --> 51:21.294
l mean, wouldn't it bother you
to lose such a close friend?

51:22.014 --> 51:25.963
This is high school, Detective Cruz.
What is a friend, anyway?

51:27.227 --> 51:30.892
A friend is someone who tells
the truth no matter what.

51:32.482 --> 51:34.391
A true friend never lies.

51:36.152 --> 51:39.770
Look. Liz was sweet.
l did her a favour.

51:40.281 --> 51:42.153
Can l go now, please?

51:43.032 --> 51:44.277
Sure, Vylette.

51:55.670 --> 52:00.711
This is high school, Detective Cruz.
What is a friend, anyway?

52:01.633 --> 52:03.875
Liz is the cat's meow. Meow!

52:04.136 --> 52:06.591
I killed Liz.
I killed the teen dream.

52:06.847 --> 52:09.848
Deal with it.
We're gonna make you one of us.

52:10.058 --> 52:11.552
You're Vylette.

52:11.768 --> 52:12.847
My Vylette.

52:13.103 --> 52:16.802
A friend is someone who tells
the truth no matter what.

52:28.617 --> 52:29.992
Detective Cruz?

52:31.618 --> 52:34.405
l don't know if l should be
talking about this.

52:35.163 --> 52:36.195
About what?

52:36.456 --> 52:38.663
Liz was a private person, you know?

52:40.502 --> 52:41.747
But l want to help.

52:42.504 --> 52:44.128
Well, that's why l'm here.

52:45.924 --> 52:48.248
l just don't know how to say this.

52:50.302 --> 52:51.582
Liz had this craving.

52:52.012 --> 52:53.636
Craving for what?

52:55.098 --> 52:56.509
For men.

52:56.766 --> 52:58.593
Strange men.

52:58.852 --> 53:02.055
No one knew,
not even Marcie or Julie.

53:02.313 --> 53:05.313
lt was her thing. l respected that.

53:05.524 --> 53:07.647
And what was her thing?

53:10.737 --> 53:11.567
Sex.

53:11.988 --> 53:12.902
Sex?

53:14.365 --> 53:15.990
With strangers.

53:17.535 --> 53:21.401
She wasn't into the boys at school.
It wasn't about boys.

53:22.038 --> 53:24.529
She liked the real thing.

53:24.749 --> 53:27.371
Real, live, strange men.

54:01.825 --> 54:03.984
She'd have her way with them.

54:04.661 --> 54:07.117
They'd be gone by dawn.
ln and out.

54:08.831 --> 54:10.658
Never to be heard from again.

54:10.916 --> 54:14.416
That's the way she liked it.
Not like high school...

54:14.670 --> 54:19.628
...where you sleep with a guy and
the entire school knows the next day.

54:20.300 --> 54:22.340
You know which bars she frequented?

54:26.138 --> 54:28.344
l have a pretty good idea.

55:01.712 --> 55:04.119
-Hi, Brenda.
-That seat's saved.

55:04.381 --> 55:06.291
But l always sit here.

55:07.635 --> 55:09.010
You do?

55:20.772 --> 55:22.598
l'm sorry.
This stall is reserved.

55:22.815 --> 55:23.811
What?

55:24.108 --> 55:25.935
Haven't you met Vylette?

55:26.193 --> 55:28.684
lt's all about Vylette.

55:29.321 --> 55:31.728
Have you guys seen the new girl?

55:32.031 --> 55:33.110
Who is she, anyway?

55:33.366 --> 55:35.691
-l don't know.
-No one does.

55:36.077 --> 55:38.532
-And her last name?
-lt's the Madonna thing.

55:38.788 --> 55:41.457
-She toured with Madonna.
-She's a model.

55:41.707 --> 55:43.866
-Totally bicoastal.
-Or just plain bi.

55:44.126 --> 55:46.794
-Hot.
-l know. Right?

55:47.045 --> 55:48.040
Zach?

55:50.256 --> 55:52.462
Nice to meet you. l'm Vylette.

55:53.050 --> 55:54.248
Yeah, l know.

55:54.593 --> 55:56.966
l saw you in Grease...

55:57.179 --> 55:58.294
...twice.

55:58.806 --> 55:59.885
You did?

56:00.099 --> 56:03.099
What can l say?
You rocked my world.

56:03.518 --> 56:04.928
l rocked your world?

56:05.144 --> 56:06.175
lt beats football.

56:06.395 --> 56:10.179
Not that l have a problem with
football. l am head cheerleader.

56:10.441 --> 56:11.721
Head cheerleader...

56:11.942 --> 56:14.777
...and star of the school play.
Well, that's a first.

56:15.029 --> 56:15.859
ls it?

56:16.071 --> 56:17.186
Yeah, it is.

56:17.406 --> 56:20.322
Let me tell you something.
Sports and drama...

56:20.575 --> 56:22.651
...it's like plaids and stripes.

56:22.994 --> 56:25.116
They don't mix.

56:25.621 --> 56:28.373
Well, the rules have been changed...

56:28.624 --> 56:30.166
...haven't they?

56:41.635 --> 56:44.922
Your ass is much
too precious for vinyl.

56:45.849 --> 56:47.047
Thank you.

57:08.368 --> 57:09.743
Hi, girls.

57:11.913 --> 57:14.119
What's wrong with this picture?

57:38.354 --> 57:40.810
-ls this spot mine?
-Yeah.

57:44.234 --> 57:46.226
l really like it here.

57:47.320 --> 57:50.190
lt's really great to have
someone to disappear with.

57:50.865 --> 57:52.692
Someplace to go.

57:56.329 --> 57:58.534
You know a girl named Vylette?

58:00.874 --> 58:03.329
She just got cast in the play.

58:04.043 --> 58:04.992
What?

58:06.129 --> 58:08.964
Well, you know, she's new.
l guess.

58:09.173 --> 58:12.209
lt's weird, though.
She saw me twice in Grease.

58:12.468 --> 58:15.005
She said that l rocked her world.

58:15.220 --> 58:17.710
lt doesn't quite all
add up to me, though.

58:18.514 --> 58:20.637
Do you know a girl named Fern?

58:20.892 --> 58:22.517
Fern Mayo?

58:23.645 --> 58:25.970
Come on.
The girl, she's a little geeky?

58:26.231 --> 58:29.101
-She does errands for Ms. Sherwood.
-l think l know.

58:29.484 --> 58:32.104
Well, Fern Mayo is Vylette.

58:32.361 --> 58:33.357
What do you mean?

58:34.029 --> 58:36.271
She's Courtney's...

58:36.490 --> 58:37.652
...creation.

58:37.866 --> 58:40.155
Why would Courtney give her
the time of day?

58:40.410 --> 58:41.573
You don't want to know.

58:41.787 --> 58:43.329
l do. Please tell me.

58:45.707 --> 58:49.834
Liz Purr is part of it.

58:52.004 --> 58:53.581
Jesus, Julie! What is it?

58:56.091 --> 59:00.040
Do you know how girls kidnap
their girlfriends on their birthdays?

59:00.345 --> 59:02.337
Well, we do that.

59:02.638 --> 59:05.508
Courtney had a stroke of genius.

59:12.314 --> 59:15.932
lt was totally disgusting.
Courtney put her back in the bed...

59:16.192 --> 59:19.892
...and tried to make it
like she was raped.

59:20.153 --> 59:21.648
That's when Fern showed up.

59:27.243 --> 59:28.821
Take her place.

59:30.705 --> 59:32.579
So what're you gonna do?

59:33.166 --> 59:34.162
l don't know.

59:34.417 --> 59:36.539
-You gotta do something.
-l know.

59:36.793 --> 59:40.292
-You can't pretend nothing happened--
-l know that.

59:41.756 --> 59:43.630
You gotta tell somebody.

59:46.177 --> 59:49.095
-l'm taking Dane to the prom.
-Surprise!

59:49.347 --> 59:52.596
Aren't we cocky? Too bad
you don't have the cock part down.

59:52.808 --> 59:55.014
Well, at least l'm not jocking it.

59:55.268 --> 59:58.020
Dane may be a jock...

59:59.105 --> 01:00:02.024
...but let's face it.
He was born to be prom king.

01:00:02.234 --> 01:00:04.476
What he does after prom
is his problem.

01:00:04.737 --> 01:00:09.148
He could get married, coach
Little League. l could give a shit.

01:00:09.865 --> 01:00:11.823
He's a yearbook photo...

01:00:12.034 --> 01:00:15.070
...a piece of nostalgia that
won't stand the test of time.

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:18.782
-So where's the cherry bomb?
-Rehearsal.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:22.416
Good. Julie can kiss
drama boy goodbye.

01:00:23.128 --> 01:00:27.041
l think Vylette is out of control.
The car, the parking place....

01:00:27.298 --> 01:00:31.461
lt's like when people first get money.
They're called nouveau riche.

01:00:31.719 --> 01:00:33.711
They drape themselves
in fur and jewels.

01:00:33.971 --> 01:00:37.090
They're pathetic,
but they don't know any better.

01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:38.298
But Vylette--

01:00:38.517 --> 01:00:40.509
Vylette is the same.

01:00:40.726 --> 01:00:44.806
For once in her pathetic life,
people are giving her the time of day.

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:48.231
The little whore is milking it
for all she's worth.

01:00:49.818 --> 01:00:51.193
What the hell?

01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:03.907
-You stupid cow!
-What?

01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:05.575
-Courtney!
-Get off.

01:01:05.832 --> 01:01:08.619
Who the heck do you
think you are? Angelyne?

01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:14.873
What the fuck are you doing?

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:17.795
Exactly what you taught me.

01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:20.174
l taught you to disrespect us?

01:01:20.387 --> 01:01:21.667
You taught me to rule.

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:26.010
That's right. Rule, bitch!
But don't forget who made you.

01:01:26.226 --> 01:01:28.977
l'm sorry. l'm at
the mercy of the crowd.

01:01:29.229 --> 01:01:32.513
l can't help it, Courtney.
They love to hate me.

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:37.269
Don't fool yourself. Deep down,
they know who you are, Fern.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.523
l'm Vylette.

01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:43.355
You're whatever the fuck
l want you to be.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:44.780
Courtney.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:47.570
Pretty little Courtney.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:50.362
Let's stop pretending, shall we?

01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:53.666
You once spoke of ammo.
Ammunition, if l'm correct.

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:56.243
l don't know why,
but it really struck me.

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:58.371
Lately, it's all come clear.

01:01:58.589 --> 01:02:02.124
And on a clear day, baby,
you can see tomorrow.

01:02:02.383 --> 01:02:03.961
Excuse me?

01:02:05.094 --> 01:02:06.719
l've got the power.

01:02:07.597 --> 01:02:10.882
Her name's sweet Liz, remember?
Your bloated boo-boo?

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:14.967
-l'll fucking shred you, you whore!
-And l'll tell a secret.

01:02:15.187 --> 01:02:18.970
Do tell. But don't be surprised
when they laugh in your face.

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:21.064
Cruz has a suspect in custody.

01:02:21.275 --> 01:02:23.351
lt ain't me.

01:02:24.445 --> 01:02:28.822
l know the truth. l know
what really happened, Courtney.

01:02:32.703 --> 01:02:37.114
l made you, and l can
break you just as easily.

01:02:37.373 --> 01:02:41.501
Good idea.
Kill me like you did Liz.

01:02:56.515 --> 01:02:58.307
You're doing the right thing.

01:02:58.559 --> 01:03:01.560
l know, l know.
Everything's gonna be okay, right?

01:03:01.812 --> 01:03:03.603
Right.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:07.767
But l'm guilty too.
Courtney will say l was there.

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:11.518
-l didn't stop them or tell the police.
-We need evidence.

01:03:11.779 --> 01:03:15.527
That would be great.
But Courtney destroyed everything.

01:03:15.742 --> 01:03:18.447
What about the Polaroid?
Wasn't there a camera?

01:03:18.703 --> 01:03:21.324
-She took a picture.
-And who has it?

01:03:21.581 --> 01:03:23.657
-l don't know.
-What do you mean?

01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:24.704
l don't know!

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:27.579
It was chaos.
We popped the trunk.

01:03:35.802 --> 01:03:37.000
She dropped it.

01:03:37.261 --> 01:03:39.053
She dropped the camera.

01:03:52.191 --> 01:03:54.896
Okay, it was right about here.

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:01.569
lt's gone.

01:04:04.452 --> 01:04:06.777
Look, Julie,
is there anything else?

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:11.578
There's nothing.

01:04:12.168 --> 01:04:14.918
At this point,
it's my word against hers.

01:04:15.503 --> 01:04:18.255
Looks like that's gonna
have to be good enough.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.432
l understand you have something
about the Liz Purr murder.

01:04:34.187 --> 01:04:36.594
We have a suspect in custody.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.891
We found the man leaving Liz's house.
lf his semen matches--

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.569
What're you talking about?

01:04:43.571 --> 01:04:46.773
Liz wasn't as innocent
as she appeared to be.

01:04:47.031 --> 01:04:48.312
Bullshit! lt's not true.

01:04:48.783 --> 01:04:51.108
lt's difficult
for you to understand--

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.366
Excuse me.

01:04:57.959 --> 01:04:59.453
This isn't happening.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.711
Liz was a virgin.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.672
Someone had sex in that bed
after Liz died.

01:05:04.882 --> 01:05:06.459
lt was just the four of you.

01:05:08.468 --> 01:05:09.548
Wait a minute.

01:05:09.803 --> 01:05:12.472
Unless someone went back.

01:05:14.182 --> 01:05:15.012
Oh, my God!

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:17.641
-What?
-She said it herself.

01:05:18.061 --> 01:05:21.263
They'll believe it because
it's their worst nightmare.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.184
Liz Purr, the picture
of teenage perfection...

01:05:24.566 --> 01:05:26.642
...obliterated by perversion.

01:05:27.277 --> 01:05:28.522
What are you saying?

01:05:28.737 --> 01:05:31.192
Courtney found a guy
to have sex in Liz's bed...

01:05:31.406 --> 01:05:33.529
...to make it look like murder.

01:05:34.117 --> 01:05:35.943
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

01:05:36.201 --> 01:05:39.321
-Where are we going?
-We are gonna bring that bitch down.

01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:48.244
Vylette?

01:05:49.172 --> 01:05:52.041
Oh, my God!
What the hell is this?

01:06:23.743 --> 01:06:25.866
Well, there you are.

01:06:26.579 --> 01:06:28.204
You had quite a fall.

01:06:28.456 --> 01:06:32.324
-What happened?
-You fainted out in the quad.

01:06:32.628 --> 01:06:34.455
l want you to take it easy...

01:06:34.713 --> 01:06:36.291
...Fern.

01:06:36.965 --> 01:06:38.590
What did you say?

01:06:39.509 --> 01:06:43.802
-Your name is Fern Mayo, correct?
-No, it's not.

01:06:44.013 --> 01:06:47.761
-Well, that's what it says right here.
-Get me out of here.

01:06:48.267 --> 01:06:49.381
There she is!

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:58.185
This is crazy!

01:06:58.442 --> 01:07:01.478
Fern Mayo!
Fern fucking Mayo!

01:07:01.695 --> 01:07:03.854
l thought you looked familiar!

01:07:04.114 --> 01:07:06.735
Take off your mask, Fern!

01:07:08.201 --> 01:07:09.696
Shut up!

01:07:23.674 --> 01:07:26.129
lt's over, bitch.

01:07:56.161 --> 01:07:58.200
What the hell is this?

01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:07.622
Oh, my God!
Fern, are you okay?

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:10.540
Fern, it's me, Julie.

01:08:10.758 --> 01:08:12.834
l'm not Fern.

01:08:17.389 --> 01:08:19.714
-Oh, my God!
-lt's okay, Fern.

01:08:19.974 --> 01:08:20.970
Go away.

01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:23.466
Please just go away.

01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:26.179
How can you look at me?

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.099
l'm shit.

01:08:28.566 --> 01:08:31.483
-l'm reprehensible.
-No, you're not.

01:08:31.734 --> 01:08:33.277
l'm nothing.

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:36.731
Before all this, l was something.
Not much, but something.

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:38.697
You were a good person, Fern.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.238
A lot of good that did me.

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:44.779
l'm nothing. l'm shit.
l'm a nobody.

01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:47.197
l don't blame you for what you did.

01:08:47.416 --> 01:08:52.243
l know what it's like to be scared.
That day, we were terrified.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.368
lt's not like you had a choice.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.090
l'm so sorry, Julie.
l'm so sorry.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.053
lt's okay. l know.

01:09:02.845 --> 01:09:04.638
What a fucking tearjerker!

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:08.091
Look. lt's like
Terms of Endearment, part three.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:10.224
Only this time,
the boyfriend's gay.

01:09:10.435 --> 01:09:12.843
And the rest of the cast sucks!

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:15.937
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:16.191 --> 01:09:17.305
What?

01:09:17.568 --> 01:09:20.023
They charged some poor guy
with murder?

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.856
What have you done, Courtney?

01:09:22.154 --> 01:09:23.981
What have you done?

01:09:24.198 --> 01:09:26.274
Just what l had to do, dear.

01:09:26.533 --> 01:09:29.984
What? Destroy another life?

01:09:30.246 --> 01:09:34.706
-Life's a bitch, then you die.
-No, honey, you're the bitch.

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:37.117
So aggressive, Julie.

01:09:37.377 --> 01:09:39.002
lt kind of turns me on.

01:09:39.254 --> 01:09:41.459
l'm sure Fern likes it.

01:09:42.548 --> 01:09:45.502
Come on, Marce.
This train wreck's getting old.

01:09:46.676 --> 01:09:49.002
lt's over, Courtney.

01:09:49.264 --> 01:09:51.671
l am petrified.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.852
See you at prom tonight, Julie.

01:09:59.064 --> 01:10:02.349
Some poor, nameless son of a bitch
thought he got lucky.

01:10:02.609 --> 01:10:04.233
Boy, was he wrong, huh?

01:10:04.527 --> 01:10:06.021
How could she do that?

01:10:06.279 --> 01:10:09.778
She's so evil.
And she's only in high school.

01:10:12.617 --> 01:10:13.898
What are we gonna do?

01:10:14.119 --> 01:10:16.277
We make her pay for what she did.

01:10:16.496 --> 01:10:18.405
We could go to prom.

01:10:18.665 --> 01:10:20.871
You're not serious, are you?

01:10:21.459 --> 01:10:24.828
Great idea. And on the way,
let's pick up some pig's blood.

01:10:25.046 --> 01:10:27.797
-That's real cute.
-Can you take me home?

01:11:26.435 --> 01:11:29.519
lt's a shame Julie
couldn't make it tonight.

01:11:29.813 --> 01:11:32.019
lsn't her boyfriend in drama?

01:11:32.232 --> 01:11:35.481
l bet they couldn't decide
who got to wear the dress.

01:11:35.776 --> 01:11:37.353
You are evil.

01:11:37.611 --> 01:11:40.777
Listen to the queen
of the damned over here.

01:12:07.012 --> 01:12:08.720
Come in.

01:12:11.933 --> 01:12:14.140
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Mom.

01:12:14.811 --> 01:12:18.144
Mrs. Purr came by today
and brought some things over...

01:12:18.356 --> 01:12:20.645
...of Liz's that
you might like to have.

01:12:20.858 --> 01:12:22.269
Thank you.

01:12:26.905 --> 01:12:29.147
-Good night, babe.
-Good night, Mom.

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:58.556
I killed Liz. I killed
the teen dream. Deal with it.

01:13:27.419 --> 01:13:29.457
To prom queens.

01:13:29.712 --> 01:13:31.704
To prom queens.

01:13:58.905 --> 01:14:00.696
Oh, my God!

01:14:02.533 --> 01:14:04.940
How original.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.196
Nothing like a little girlfriend
to spice up an evening.

01:14:08.622 --> 01:14:10.828
How about some public affection, girls?

01:14:11.374 --> 01:14:14.708
lt's like, how low
could you possibly get?

01:14:14.919 --> 01:14:17.161
Carpet munchers!

01:14:17.963 --> 01:14:19.042
Do you hear something?

01:14:19.256 --> 01:14:21.332
No. Do you hear something?

01:14:21.842 --> 01:14:23.585
No, l don't.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.926
Well, if it isn't
the beautiful people.

01:14:36.188 --> 01:14:39.722
l've been meaning to tell you.
You are to die. To die!

01:14:39.983 --> 01:14:40.896
Thank you.

01:14:41.651 --> 01:14:43.977
l am so bored tonight.

01:14:45.156 --> 01:14:47.907
l think it's time
for a little room service.

01:14:51.244 --> 01:14:54.862
Reality check. There's an
announcement that needs to be made.

01:14:55.081 --> 01:14:57.073
Give it up for the prom queen.

01:14:57.375 --> 01:15:00.541
Oh, my God, Courtney!
l am so sorry.

01:15:01.962 --> 01:15:05.960
lt's okay. We can't all
be up to speed, can we, girls?

01:15:34.825 --> 01:15:36.652
l'm sorry. l'm very sorry.

01:15:38.161 --> 01:15:40.568
That was wonderful, wasn't it?

01:15:41.706 --> 01:15:46.663
Welcome to Reagan High's senior prom!

01:15:51.298 --> 01:15:54.583
You always were such a spirited group.

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.042
Eat me!

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.427
All right, all right, then.

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:06.012
The moment that we have
all been waiting for.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:08.769
The announcement...

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:12.307
...of Reagan High's
prom king and queen!

01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:23.282
l love this part.

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:26.864
This is my most exciting part.

01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:29.367
l'm nervous.

01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:37.669
Our prom king this year is...

01:16:39.467 --> 01:16:41.091
...Dane Sanders!

01:16:48.933 --> 01:16:50.842
Yeah, baby!

01:17:03.363 --> 01:17:07.111
Dane was always
the most spirited of the bunch.

01:17:09.911 --> 01:17:10.741
All right.

01:17:13.873 --> 01:17:15.865
Now the cherry on the cake...

01:17:16.958 --> 01:17:18.832
...of a delicious year.

01:17:19.294 --> 01:17:23.421
l'm so pleased to announce
that the prom queen...

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:28.634
...to reign over our kingdom
this year is....

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.231
You'll be pleased.

01:17:46.068 --> 01:17:48.061
Courtney Shane!

01:18:12.342 --> 01:18:15.047
Reagan High's queen!

01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:43.907
We love you, Courtney!

01:18:44.746 --> 01:18:48.446
Thank you so much, Ms. Sherwood.

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:50.618
Thank you, senior class.

01:18:50.835 --> 01:18:54.702
You don't know how much it means
to me. lt's a dream come true.

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:00.758
Thank you, everyone.

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.546
-l love you--
-I killed Liz.

01:19:02.762 --> 01:19:05.431
I killed the teen dream.
Deal with it.

01:19:08.559 --> 01:19:11.643
I killed Liz. I killed
the teen dream. Deal with it.

01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:13.681
What?

01:19:15.857 --> 01:19:19.226
I killed Liz. I killed
the teen dream. Deal with it.

01:19:23.823 --> 01:19:25.566
Thank you so--

01:19:27.451 --> 01:19:28.779
Ms. Sherwood, fix it.

01:19:29.536 --> 01:19:34.114
What is going on here? l do not
appreciate a prank at a time like this!

01:19:34.332 --> 01:19:35.993
That's her voice.

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:38.286
That's her!

01:20:02.858 --> 01:20:05.610
l've been a very, very naughty boy.

01:20:05.861 --> 01:20:07.485
Have you?

01:20:08.196 --> 01:20:09.572
Like to do the honours?

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.030
That bitch!

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:23.622
-lt's gotta be true.
-She'll pay for this.

01:20:31.885 --> 01:20:34.007
Eat shit.

01:20:35.888 --> 01:20:37.595
-Skanky slut!
-You should be ashamed.

01:20:37.806 --> 01:20:39.004
Get off the stage!

01:20:40.392 --> 01:20:42.384
Off the stage!

01:20:49.192 --> 01:20:53.402
Fairy tales can come true

01:20:53.612 --> 01:20:55.984
It can happen to you

01:20:57.407 --> 01:21:01.072
If you're young at heart.

01:21:01.286 --> 01:21:04.655
Do you hear me? You are dead!

01:21:04.873 --> 01:21:08.703
But it's hard
You will find

01:21:09.084 --> 01:21:12.120
To be narrow of mind

01:21:13.046 --> 01:21:16.167
If you're young at heart

01:21:16.592 --> 01:21:18.170
Motherfucker!

01:21:18.427 --> 01:21:22.887
And if you should survive

01:21:23.139 --> 01:21:25.974
To a hundred and five

01:21:26.559 --> 01:21:29.228
Look at all you'll derive

01:21:29.478 --> 01:21:33.096
Out of being alive

01:21:34.233 --> 01:21:37.068
And here is the best part

01:21:39.278 --> 01:21:41.567
You have a head start

01:21:42.948 --> 01:21:45.024
If you are among

01:21:45.659 --> 01:21:48.744
The very young at heart

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.402
Smile pretty, Courtney.

01:22:00.172 --> 01:22:02.497
This is high school, Detective Cruz.

01:22:02.758 --> 01:22:04.881
What is a friend, anyway?
