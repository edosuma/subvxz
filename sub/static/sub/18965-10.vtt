Ray Wyatt's opened a commissary.
You're losing money.

00:04.964 --> 00:06.381
Let me go.
Absolutely not.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.091
To the happy couple.
I have to go.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.802
Wyatts don't apologize.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.470
I thought
your mother passed.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.680
She's still alive.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.723
WYATT:
Take care of both of them.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.728
I never
should've let you

00:19.728 --> 00:22.439
talk me into
going back to Hope Valley.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.359
What you shouldn't have done
is agree to cover up a crime.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.111
If you'd just left me alone,
I'd be home, safe and sound.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.364
But, no,
you had to be a hero.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.449
And now Ray Wyatt
wants me dead.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.409
You're the only one that can
put Ray Wyatt behind bars.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.203
Did you think
he was gonna forget about you?

00:36.203 --> 00:38.539
What do we do now,
pray for a miracle?

00:38.539 --> 00:41.667
We don't need a miracle.
We just need...

00:41.667 --> 00:43.794
The ledgers. I know.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.548
You do remember where
you buried them, don't you?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.758
Of course I do.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.473
Oh, I'm sorry
I'm late this morning.

00:56.473 --> 01:00.227
No problem. Mr. Thompson's
here for breakfast.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.980
Oh, he's very particular
about his eggs.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.899
Seems like he likes them
as crusty as he is.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.734
Heh heh heh. Well,
at least we have a customer,

01:06.734 --> 01:08.652
thanks to your advertising.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.238
Yeah, business is picking up,
isn't it?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.781
You're an optimist.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.491
We've already run out
of milk for the week.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.826
That's got to
mean something.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.160
I think all that means

01:17.160 --> 01:18.996
is that Cody likes milk
with his cookies.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.206
I'll tell you what. You run
this plate out to Mr. Crusty,

01:21.206 --> 01:22.708
and I'll run across
to the mercantile

01:22.708 --> 01:24.418

some of that milk.

You look like you could use
some more coffee.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.649
I'm writing Jack
another letter,

01:47.649 --> 01:49.818

things to say.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.194
There's always

01:51.194 --> 01:53.697
I just wish he'd write back.
Oh, he will.

In the meantime, let's start
planning your wedding.

Guess it's
better than worrying,

01:59.745 --> 02:01.705
which is all I'm doing
right now.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.832
About Jack,
about my students...

02:03.832 --> 02:07.335
The Wyatt boys? Have you
heard from their father?

02:07.335 --> 02:09.713
He's supposed to be back
this morning.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.966
He needs to talk to them about
what happened with their mother.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.258
I think Chad'll be okay,

02:13.258 --> 02:15.594
but Earl's still hurting
pretty bad.

Marlise won't let it go.
She's hired an investigator.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.706
Does she know
where I am?

I don't know,

I'm not surprised.

We go way back, my friend.
I thought you ought to know.

I was due back today anyway,
but I have to say,

03:55.944 --> 03:58.030
your telegram
took me by surprise.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.865
I really need your help
with Chad and Earl.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.825
What seems
to be the problem?

04:01.825 --> 04:03.911
They're having trouble
fitting in,

and now I think I'm starting to
get through to Chad,

04:05.579 --> 04:07.288

Earl's a handful.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.751
Mr. Wyatt,
it's more than that.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.336
He's picking fights,
he's teasing the other children,

04:13.336 --> 04:15.380
and neither one of them
will apologize.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.298
Well, I haven't had a problem
at any other school.

04:17.298 --> 04:22.179
Maybe those teachers were
just too afraid to say anything.

to listen to her.

Yes, he does.
But if there's a problem...

04:35.275 --> 04:38.112
The problem is,
you're standing here talking

with my sons.

35:20.786 --> 35:21.995
And did he listen to you?

35:21.995 --> 35:24.372
Yeah, he listened, all right.

35:24.372 --> 35:29.711
I lost my job, but...
I got my family back.

If I know the people here,
you'll find a new job soon.

35:33.172 --> 35:34.549

Now, if you'll give us
ten minutes,

35:36.301 --> 35:38.219
we'll finish up,
and you can start class.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.388
I'll be outside.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.975

35:45.685 --> 35:47.980
Um, I-I wanted to...

35:47.980 --> 35:50.107
I guess I should...

35:50.107 --> 35:53.526
well, what I'm trying
to say is...

35:56.905 --> 35:59.658
I'm really sorry
for everything I did.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.244
I'm sorry, too.

36:04.203 --> 36:06.999
That means a whole lot to me.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.836
Does it mean we can
come back to school?

For two people
who are supposed to be dead,

36:29.270 --> 36:31.731
they look very much alive.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.609
Keep your mouth shut.
I'll handle this.

36:41.407 --> 36:42.993
I'd make introductions,

36:42.993 --> 36:45.286
but you gentlemen
already know this woman.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.955
Afraid I haven't
had the pleasure.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.832
I was hoping
for a better lie.

36:48.832 --> 36:54.046
Henry, are you going to say
you don't know her as well?

36:54.046 --> 36:57.298
Maybe someone should tell us
what this is all about.

36:57.298 --> 37:00.426
I'll keep it simple.
You're both under arrest.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.303
Under arrest?
For what?

37:02.303 --> 37:04.806
Bribery.
Obstruction of justice.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.516
Attempted murder.
There's probably more...

37:06.516 --> 37:08.393
but that's enough
to get us started.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.437
We have the bank ledgers
that prove Mr. Gowen's guilty

37:11.437 --> 37:14.024

to keep quiet about it.

37:14.024 --> 37:16.442
All you have are accusations.

37:16.442 --> 37:18.403
We'll let
a judge decide.

37:18.403 --> 37:22.741
Bill...
I'll turn state's evidence

37:22.741 --> 37:24.784
if you can put
a good word in for me.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.578
Not making
any promises, Henry.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.081
You coward.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.498
Maybe.

37:30.498 --> 37:34.211
Money's one thing,
but you went too far.

37:34.211 --> 37:36.671
I'm not losing everything
I've worked for because of you.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.052
Putting you in jail
or digging you a grave

37:42.052 --> 37:44.679

has its price.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.496
Not really going to
lock me up, are you?

38:10.496 --> 38:12.415
I'm pretty sure
that's what sheriffs do.

38:12.415 --> 38:15.085
What do you mean? After
everything we've been through?

38:15.085 --> 38:18.797
Especially after everything
we've been through.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.006
Huh.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.259
Maybe I'm wrong, but...

38:22.259 --> 38:24.385
I thought
I meant something to you.

between us.

How's Mr. Gowen doing?

Well, aside from
his terrible mood,

39:08.387 --> 39:10.431
Faith say it's just
a few bumps and bruises.

Henry.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.690
I know he's guilty,

39:18.690 --> 39:21.526
but he did try to stop Wyatt
from shooting you.

I hope you'll tell that
to the judge.
