WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:04.879
And the only thing wrong...

00:05.005 --> 00:07.173
The only thing wrong
with the American dream

00:07.299 --> 00:09.967
is people, too many people,

00:10.135 --> 00:13.971
too many of us telling young people
that the dream is dead.

00:14.181 --> 00:17.350
They told me that when I was growing up
in the slums of Trenton.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.060
And they were wrong.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.729
They told me that when I decided
to run for senator

00:21.855 --> 00:24.774
with only $58
in my savings account.

00:24.900 --> 00:28.528
And they were wrong
and they are still telling me that now,

00:28.654 --> 00:31.197
that I don't have a chance
because I'm black,

00:31.323 --> 00:33.199
because I don't have the right nose,

00:33.325 --> 00:36.911
because I still only have $58
in my savings account.

00:46.004 --> 00:50.717
With your help,
we can keep that dream alive.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.305
And in closing...

01:04.940 --> 01:06.232
Just...

01:09.570 --> 01:10.570
let me say...

01:10.738 --> 01:15.074
Let me say that you should
all donate the legal maximum

01:15.200 --> 01:18.786
to the next president
of the United States.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.624
Are you okay?
Do you need some water?

01:23.751 --> 01:25.752
No. I'm fine, really.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.467
Handsome guy like you,
I bet you get 70% of the women.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.718
Here's hoping.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.471
Of course, it helps
your wife died of cancer.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.931
I'm sorry,
but the sympathy vote's in your pocket.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.434
Yeah, I appreciate
your support.

01:41.560 --> 01:45.104
Listen, Senator,
my union has a hell of a war chest.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.027
I've always been
strong on the union.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.280
The thing is, you always go on
in your speeches about the workers

01:54.406 --> 01:57.158
in Indonesia, Cambodia, Timbuktu.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.244
Because I think we have a...
A moral...

02:00.370 --> 02:01.871
My union members are hurting.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.917
They don't care about moral this
and moral that. Are you all right?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.919
- Senator?
- Hey!

02:08.045 --> 02:09.712
The guys are gonna love that.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.843
Everyone, give him some room.
Give him room to breathe!

02:16.428 --> 02:18.221
Back off, please!

02:18.347 --> 02:19.722
Senator, are you all right?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.843
The senator's
suffering from nausea,

02:56.969 --> 02:59.220
headache and
mental confusion.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.139
Bad sushi is so
hard to diagnose.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.226
You're being childish.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.062
Look, if his case is
as trivial as you think,

03:08.188 --> 03:10.106
it'll take you three minutes
to diagnose.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.108
Three minutes that I could spend
sitting on the toilet

03:12.234 --> 03:14.318
with the funny pages.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.113
- You're mad at me.
- Nope.

03:17.239 --> 03:20.032
I never liked
Cameron or Foreman.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.076
Do you know why I'm forcing you
to fire one of them?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.120
Because you need to prove to me
that you're a team player.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.915
Now, if you did that, you wouldn't
need to go through this exercise.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.794
Fine. I'll hold the senator's hair
while he upchucks.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.046
Oh, and by the way,

03:34.172 --> 03:36.841
I need you to give a speech
at the National Cardiology Conference

03:36.967 --> 03:38.009
next week.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.011
I don't do speeches.
I'm shy.

03:40.137 --> 03:44.473
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals
has developed a new ACE inhibitor.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.225
I would like you
to extol the virtues

03:46.351 --> 03:48.519
of this
breakthrough medication.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.771
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals?

03:50.898 --> 03:53.149
Wait a second,
don't I own that company?

03:53.275 --> 03:55.192
Oh, no, that's right.
You do.

03:55.319 --> 03:59.405
Viopril is a significant improvement
over the old version.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.032
All there in the study.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.701
Well, I know its price tag
is significantly improved.

04:04.494 --> 04:08.414
You can either give one 10-minute talk
and one 3-minute diagnosis,

04:08.540 --> 04:11.042
or you can fire one of your pets.

04:13.462 --> 04:17.715
My understanding was that you believed
in rationality above all else.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.599
Viopril.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.561
I appreciate your
keeping the media away.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.022
We're keeping
your staff away as well.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.316
- Take it easy now.
- I'm in the middle of a campaign.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.778
The faster we can get you better,
the faster you can get out of here.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.488
Anyone else
at the fundraiser get sick?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.782
I don't think so.
And I don't think that's it.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.951
I mean, I've been under
the weather for weeks.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.079
You know, lots of traveling. I'm
supposed to be in the Sudan next week.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.373
Oh!

04:53.168 --> 04:56.879
Helps me concentrate.
Even better than drugs.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.716
Open your mouth, please.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.222
That's quite a scar.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.684
When I was six, I fell off the swing
and bit my tongue.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.144
Couldn't talk right
for the longest time.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.396
Lots of teasing.

05:13.522 --> 05:17.566
You know, it just made me fight harder,
speak up for those who can't.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.946
Tongues heal too fast.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.949
Your political consultants
have written you a nice story.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.119
In a tight race, the lispers alone
could put you over the top.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.664
You a Republican,
or you just hate all politicians?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.625
I just find being forced
to sit through drivel annoying.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.004
You find sincerity annoying?

05:38.130 --> 05:40.006
You're a black kid
from the ghetto

05:40.132 --> 05:43.050
who made it to Yale Law
and the United States Senate.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.136
That's a sufficiently
mythical story.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.097
You don't need to lie
about your tongue.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.393
Must've missed it.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.606
What's wrong?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.073
What is it?

06:06.199 --> 06:08.200
It's not the food.
It's your brain.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.369
Get an MRI and
a lumbar puncture.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.163
Cancel your travel plans.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.883
The senator's LP
showed no sign of infection,

06:24.009 --> 06:25.259
and the MRI
looks fairly clean.

06:25.385 --> 06:29.180
I guess we can tell him
he's fairly healthy and can go home.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.432
Well, there is
something in Broca's area,

06:31.558 --> 06:34.977
- but it's small, low intensity.
- Most likely just background noise.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.563
Care to bet your job on that?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.148
What was that?

06:39.274 --> 06:40.191
What was what?

06:40.317 --> 06:41.442
You got annoyed.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.569
That was clearly
an annoyed face.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.988
I get annoyed by glib remarks
about our futures.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.531
But last week you
didn't get annoyed.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.826
You made poopie in your pants.
It's weird.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.205
It's almost like now you know
you have nothing to worry about.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.123
Chase has nothing
to worry about?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.542
None of you has
anything to worry about.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.503
What happened?

07:00.629 --> 07:04.799
Vogler saw the error of his ways
and repented.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.258
The lesion could be nothing.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.886
Also, it could be a brain tumor
or an infection.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.138
There's only one way
to find out which.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.932
You want to cut
into his brain?

07:13.058 --> 07:14.141
Dangerous, I know.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.103
Especially since he's a politician
and his brain's all twisted.

07:17.229 --> 07:20.106
But I weighed that against the risk
of him stroking out before lunch.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.857
Call Surgery.
Get it scheduled.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.828
You're not pregnant.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.329
Well, I told you that.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.624
But there's got to be some
other reason I'm still spotting.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.293
Sure. You were pregnant.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.588
Based on your hormone levels,
you've had a miscarriage.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.298
I haven't even
been on a date.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.591
Right.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.552
And since it's physically
impossible to have sex

07:49.678 --> 07:50.845
without someone
buying you dinner...

07:50.971 --> 07:54.640
I haven't had sex
since I split up with my husband.

07:54.766 --> 07:55.891
That was almost a year ago.

07:56.017 --> 08:00.688
Fine. Have it your way.
Immaculate conception.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.399
What do I do?

08:03.525 --> 08:04.692
Well, it's obvious.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.736
Start a religion.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.575
In my office.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.122
Afternoon delight.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.457
She just loves
the hard wood.

08:21.751 --> 08:26.881
You're not doing a brain biopsy
based on a spot on an MRI.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.007
Where'd you get that?

08:28.133 --> 08:30.050
Not on a United States senator.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.302
Oh, just so I'm clear,

08:31.428 --> 08:33.637
a janitor would be okay?
Do you have a list?

08:33.763 --> 08:37.433
A brain biopsy can cause
permanent neurological damage.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.101
Whereas tumors are
really good for brains.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.020
Make them grow
big and strong.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.772
- It's my call.
- No, it's not.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.442
So you're pulling
rank on patient care?

08:46.568 --> 08:47.902
It's not my call either.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.612
It's up to you.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.488
Either it's a tumor
or it's an infection

08:51.615 --> 08:53.073
that the lumbar puncture
didn't pick up.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.326
Either way, unless we treat it
immediately, it could kill you.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.537
Or it could be nothing. Reading
brain MRIs is not an exact science.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.497
Well, what caused
my symptoms?

09:00.624 --> 09:02.124
Wow! Excellent question.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.500
Many doctors wouldn't
have gone there.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.045
It could be
a transient ischemic attack.

09:06.171 --> 09:10.090
You could make the argument for watching
carefully for the time being.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.759
But you'd only
make that argument

09:11.885 --> 09:13.636
if you were an administrator
covering your ass.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.430
- That's absurd and insulting.
- Insulting, yes.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.349
What would the voters think?

09:18.558 --> 09:22.102
If they find out
I've had a brain biopsy?

09:24.481 --> 09:27.233
This could
leave you brain damaged,

09:27.359 --> 09:29.443
and you're worried
about NASCAR dads?

09:48.964 --> 09:50.256
It's not a brain tumor.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.050
It's not
a bacterial infection either.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.678
So you biopsied his brain
for nothing?

09:55.971 --> 09:58.472
If that were true,
would Dr. Wilson's mouth

09:58.598 --> 10:00.891
be contorted into
that ugly shape?

10:02.560 --> 10:05.020
It's toxoplasmosis.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.022
You sure?

10:08.108 --> 10:11.402
Which means the Great Black Hope
has full-blown AIDS.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.074
They're gonna
love that in Dubuque.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.498
Toxoplasmosis is a fairly
common fungus you can get

10:24.624 --> 10:27.584
from eating under-cooked meat
or touching cat feces.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.045
In rare cases, the fungi
travel up the bloodstream

10:30.171 --> 10:34.133
and latch onto the brain,
causing a lesion or inflammation.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.635
So, what's the prognosis?

10:39.180 --> 10:42.099
Toxo usually
responds to treatment,

10:42.225 --> 10:44.059
but it only causes
a lesion in your brain

10:44.185 --> 10:47.730
if your immune system
is extremely weak to begin with.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.568
Senator,
I'm afraid you have AIDS.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.948
- As I'm sure...
- No!

10:58.074 --> 11:00.951
As I'm sure you know,
people with HIV can live a long time.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.828
What else could
do this to me?

11:03.538 --> 11:05.039
Theoretically, certain cancers.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.334
If you have toxo in your brain,
you have AIDS.

11:09.753 --> 11:13.464
I do not have AIDS.

11:13.590 --> 11:17.259
I don't shoot up drugs.

11:17.385 --> 11:21.013
I don't sleep with...

11:21.139 --> 11:23.974
This is very bad news.
I get that and I sympathize.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.060
But we gotta speed through
the denial phase

11:26.186 --> 11:28.437
because you need antiretrovirals
and you need them fast.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.111
You haven't even
tested me for HIV!

11:36.237 --> 11:37.071
We will.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.990
But the toxo drugs
are gonna piss off your fungi.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.117
And when fungi get pissed...

11:43.828 --> 11:46.121
I am not going
to take the pills.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.499
You're afraid
word will leak out.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.294
Trust me. You're not gonna
be president either way.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.714
They don't call it the White House
because of the paint job.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.133
Here's what you're gonna do.

11:58.510 --> 12:02.805
You're gonna give me the drugs
for the toxo only.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.393
You're going to test me for HIV
under a false name.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.686
You are going to
test me for cancer

12:09.813 --> 12:12.689
and anything else that could have
done this to me.

12:12.899 --> 12:16.276
If I have cancer,
I will deal with it.

12:19.072 --> 12:24.201
But I do not have AIDS.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.081
"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals
are pleased to announce

12:29.207 --> 12:30.791
that Dr. Gregory House
will present

12:30.917 --> 12:34.336
the latest research on our exciting
new ACE inhibitor."

12:35.797 --> 12:37.798
You're making that up.
That's Vogler's company.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.007
Press release.

12:39.134 --> 12:43.095
"During an address at the North
American Cardiology Conference."

12:46.015 --> 12:47.182
House never gives speeches.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.059
But when I really
believe in something...

12:49.185 --> 12:52.271
Gosh dang it, I got a chance
to make a difference here.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.274
You made a deal with Vogler?

12:55.400 --> 12:58.068
It's all the rage.
Everybody's doing it.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.946
So, what's the deal?

13:01.072 --> 13:04.074
You get to keep all of us
if you flog his products?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.701
One speech. No biggie.

13:06.703 --> 13:10.122
Foreman's doing a bone marrow biopsy
to check for cancer.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.291
Cancer?
The senator's got AIDS.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.543
Cancer sounds better
in a press release.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.379
I need you guys to rush
the ELISA test for HIV.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.964
Thank you.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.091
For the speech.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.927
When I said "rush",
I meant, you know, fast.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.096
"Stat's" the word
you doctors use, right?

13:26.222 --> 13:28.599
- I know it's hard for you.
- Double stat?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.397
This may sting a little.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.068
- Sorry.
- It wasn't the shot.

13:40.195 --> 13:43.655
It's... My head's killing me.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.366
You know, Senator,
we don't have to do this now.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.660
We can hold off
till your HIV test comes back.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.581
Because you figure
it's gonna come back positive.

13:52.707 --> 13:53.874
In my experience...

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Patients lie,

13:55.126 --> 13:58.754
politicians lie more,
and black politicians...

13:59.214 --> 14:02.174
I don't think black politicians
lie more than white politicians.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.884
We lie less.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.720
You figure we're
morally superior?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.639
I've got my theories.

14:09.474 --> 14:13.018
No, we just can't
get away with it.

14:15.021 --> 14:19.274
No one's gonna give us
the benefit of the doubt.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.277
No one's gonna cut
us a second chance.

14:22.904 --> 14:26.823
And when it happens,
it's not just a bad politician.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.284
It's a bad role model.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.204
It's a dis...

14:32.789 --> 14:36.291
discredit to the race.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.096
You ready?

14:49.222 --> 14:52.140
Yeah.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.103
Take a deep breath.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.949
Dr. House, I just wanted...

15:09.075 --> 15:10.033
You're welcome, again.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.243
I want you to
know how much...

15:11.369 --> 15:13.620
Got it. You're grateful.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.582
Apparently you seem to think
it will mean a lot to me to know that.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.251
Do you know why
people pray to God?

15:19.377 --> 15:20.419
I thought you
didn't believe in God.

15:20.545 --> 15:21.503
I don't.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.214
Well, then you better be making
a very good point.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.882
Do you think they pray to him
and praise him

15:26.009 --> 15:27.759
because they want him
to know how great he is?

15:27.969 --> 15:29.386
God already knows that.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.599
Are you comparing me to God?

15:33.725 --> 15:37.936
I mean, that's great, but just so you
know, I've never made a tree.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.815
I thank you because
it means something to me

15:43.443 --> 15:45.819
to be grateful
for what I receive.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.703
You are the most naive
atheist I've ever met.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.706
Dr. House,
you have a patient in Room 1.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.333
Thank God.

16:01.294 --> 16:06.298
People pray so that God won't
crush them like bugs.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.511
I'm not gonna crush you.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.060
Petechial bruising?
I don't know if I pronounced that right.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.854
Gosh, the Internet is
such a wonderful tool.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.441
- It could be leukemia.
- Definitely possible.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.069
The more likely
diagnosis is hickey.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.696
Well, it can't be a hickey.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.282
Why is everybody so ashamed
of sex all of a sudden?

16:32.408 --> 16:34.618
I'm not having sex.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.079
I've barely even thought
about sex since my marriage.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.207
I say you're having sex,
you say you're not.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.251
Either you're lying
or I'm wrong.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.170
Or there's some middle ground.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.505
You mean, like, oral?

16:46.631 --> 16:49.549
I mean, you're having sex
without knowing it.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.094
I'm testing you for booze,
drugs and GHB.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.681
I don't drink...
What's GHB?

16:55.807 --> 16:57.974
The date-rape drug.

17:16.244 --> 17:18.161
It's positive.

17:30.925 --> 17:34.136
Your T cell count is eight,

17:34.262 --> 17:36.096
which means there's a good chance
you'll die.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.936
I'm telling you this because
we need to contact your sexual partners.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.939
I've only had two girlfriends.
Two.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.775
After my wife died.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.319
I used condoms.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.739
You know the chances
of you getting HIV

17:53.865 --> 17:56.450
from heterosexual
sex with a condom?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.160
Yes.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.245
Someday there will
be a black president.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.581
Someday there will
be a gay president.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.833
Maybe there'll even be a gay,
black president.

18:04.959 --> 18:10.130
But one combination I do not see
happening is gay, black and dead.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.591
You need to stop
lying to me.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.634
It must be miserable,

18:14.761 --> 18:16.470
always assuming
the worst in people.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.221
Cut the crap.
You're dying.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.725
And you're clever,
you're witty and you are a coward.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.560
You're scared
of taking chances.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.187
I take chances all the time.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.605
It's one of my
worst qualities.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.190
On people?

18:31.819 --> 18:34.988
Wanting to believe the best
about people doesn't make it true.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.615
Being afraid to believe it
doesn't make it false.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.617
Well, that's very moving.
It's a shame I don't vote.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.620
No, no, no.
This is who I am.

18:41.746 --> 18:42.996
I believe in people.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.374
I'm not hiply cynical,
and I don't make easy, snide remarks.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.919
I would rather think
that people are good

18:49.045 --> 18:51.129
and be disappointed
once and again.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.440
I need to draw
some more blood.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.809
Nurse!

19:45.935 --> 19:48.895
The antiretrovirals
aren't working.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.981
That's not surprising.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.442
He's just gonna keep getting worse.
You realize that, right?

19:54.569 --> 19:56.945
Why are you
spying on my case?

19:57.071 --> 19:59.239
Why are you giving
that speech next week?

19:59.365 --> 20:00.907
We're both just doing
what we have to do.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.492
You don't see
a problem with that?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.494
Checking in on a patient?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.997
Yeah, wow. How do I look
myself in the mirror?

20:07.123 --> 20:10.041
You're not being asked to perpetrate
a fraud on the American people.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.167
It's a 10-minute speech.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.460
That I've been
ordered to give.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.629
- Vogler's drug works.
- Don't care.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.257
Why do you have to make
everything so dramatic?

20:17.383 --> 20:20.176
'Cause I'm a very
high-strung little lap dog.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.732
Uh-uh. No pills.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.275
What's going on?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.945
The antiretrovirals
aren't working.

20:39.071 --> 20:39.905
Why not?

20:41.699 --> 20:43.283
Because you don't have AIDS.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.330
The first test was
a false positive.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.041
Happens one time
in every 5,000.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.293
You ran a second test?

20:53.419 --> 20:56.296
Yeah.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.382
You're still dying.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.888
The only difference is,
now we don't know why.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.778
He's continuing to lose control
of the muscles on his right side.

21:19.904 --> 21:23.031
His brain is getting foggier and his
T cells are still in single digits.

21:23.157 --> 21:26.159
- Why are we doing this here?
- So Cuddy can't find us.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.370
Unless we figure out
the underlying disease,

21:28.496 --> 21:30.246
this guy's lied to
his last constituent.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.374
False negative
on the PCR AIDS test?

21:32.500 --> 21:33.750
Ran it twice.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.669
Immunoglobulin deficiency?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.128
No history of
respiratory problems.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.297
Idiopathic T cell deficiency.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.299
"Idiopathic" from the Latin
meaning "we're idiots"

21:41.425 --> 21:43.969
'cause we can't figure
out what's causing it.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.556
- Give him a whole body scan.
- You hate whole body scans.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.141
Because they're useless.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.685
Could probably scan
every one of us

21:51.811 --> 21:54.145
and find five different doodads
that look like cancer.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.565
But when you're fourth down
and a hundred to go in the snow,

21:57.692 --> 22:00.694
you don't call a running play
up the middle, unless you're the Jets.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.448
I hate sports metaphors.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.701
Why did you order
the second AIDS test?

22:07.827 --> 22:08.910
Standard procedure.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.579
Oh, well, that's you,
Mr. Standard Procedure.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.873
You suspected the first test
was a false positive?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.458
I knew he was
going to Africa,

22:15.584 --> 22:17.711
and I figured he was vaccinated
for Hep A and B.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.212
That could cause
a false positive.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.423
Yeah, but you knew that
before you ordered the first test.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.383
- What changed?
- I should have ordered both.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.386
You were sure he had AIDS.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.139
Then you talked to him,
then you had doubts.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.557
What did he say?

22:31.058 --> 22:34.352
He said he had not engaged
in any risky behavior.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.357
- And you believed him.
- He didn't have any reason to lie.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.736
Everybody lies,
except politicians?

22:42.862 --> 22:45.405
House, I believe
you're a romantic.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.116
You didn't just believe him,
you believed in him.

22:48.242 --> 22:50.994
Do you want to come over tonight
and watch old movies and cry?

22:52.121 --> 22:53.997
Dr. Cameron's getting to you.

22:54.123 --> 22:56.041
Well, I guess you can't be
around that much niceness

22:56.167 --> 22:57.250
and not get any on you.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.793
Is that why you haven't
put the moves on her?

22:58.919 --> 23:02.130
What makes you think
I haven't put the moves on her?

23:06.177 --> 23:07.969
Boy! You're in trouble.

23:18.272 --> 23:21.232
You have restored my faith
in the human race.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.612
- You're lying.
- No. I'm not lying.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.699
Just got your results back.
No GHB, no nothing.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.077
It means you're having sex
and you're lying about it.

23:32.203 --> 23:35.205
No. And I have a new symptom.

23:35.998 --> 23:39.125
I have a rash on my butt.

23:40.961 --> 23:44.464
Do you wanna... Yeah.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.472
What is it?

23:52.598 --> 23:56.518
- It's a carpet burn.
- No. It can't be.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.478
Doctor, I love sex.

23:58.604 --> 24:01.815
I miss it. I haven't had
any in over a year.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.859
Well, you managed
to keep this appointment,

24:04.985 --> 24:07.320
so you have no
short-term memory problem.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.405
Multiple personalities?

24:09.532 --> 24:11.241
Do you find yourself
losing chunks of time?

24:11.367 --> 24:13.493
Do you wake up and you don't
remember falling asleep?

24:13.619 --> 24:16.871
No. I just wake up
really exhausted.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.166
- Something upsetting you?
- No.

24:22.294 --> 24:25.213
My ex lives
in the apartment downstairs.

24:25.339 --> 24:26.840
He's always calling me,

24:26.966 --> 24:28.299
always wanting to
get back together,

24:28.425 --> 24:29.926
complaining
about mixed signals.

24:30.052 --> 24:33.179
"Get out of my life."
How much clearer can you get?

24:34.306 --> 24:37.016
We have a sleep lab
in the basement.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.646
If nothing else, it will get you
away from your ex for a night.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.204
Slightly enlarged lymph node
in his left armpit.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.164
How slightly?

24:59.290 --> 25:00.206
Quarter mil.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.083
- Lymphoma?
- Sure.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.003
Or he's had a cold
in the last six months.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.046
What, you got her
on speed dial?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.507
I just follow
the scent of arrogance.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.551
Another slightly
enlarged node over here.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.262
Two more in his neck
and one in his groin.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.181
And there's
a cyst in his liver.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.516
It looks complex.
Central necrosis?

25:18.642 --> 25:21.019
Spontaneous bleeding. It's benign.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.062
I was rooting for
a really cool tumor.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.856
Instead, we're stuck
with this crap.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.609
Doesn't matter. Once you find them,
you gotta check them.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.527
Knock yourselves out.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.072
I just saw Senator Wright.
He looks like hell.

25:33.199 --> 25:36.868
That sushi must've been
a lot worse than you thought.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.871
Mr. Vogler, would you like
a free whole body scan?

25:40.164 --> 25:42.081
A man of your stature
should get himself checked

25:42.208 --> 25:43.875
at least three times a year.

25:44.001 --> 25:47.378
Here's a few key points
I want you to cover during your speech.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.715
Fourteen pages.

25:50.841 --> 25:54.219
The audience will be comatose
by paragraph two.

25:54.345 --> 25:55.887
Throw in a joke.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.102
Dr. Chase, we need to talk.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.024
How do you see this ending?

26:08.150 --> 26:09.567
What ending?

26:09.693 --> 26:11.819
I can't fire you,
so you have no reason to fear me,

26:11.946 --> 26:14.864
and, therefore,
no reason to lie to me.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.866
You told Cuddy
where I was.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.785
You told Vogler
what I was doing.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.919
- Yeah.
- So how can I work with you?

26:29.588 --> 26:32.465
Well,
you don't have a choice.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.428
This might hurt a little.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.555
Lie to me.

26:41.225 --> 26:44.185
Okay. It'll feel
like a gentle massage.

26:44.728 --> 26:50.233
House is a lousy teacher.

26:50.359 --> 26:53.903
You can't lie for beans.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.656
Have you ever told
any really big ones?

26:57.700 --> 27:01.369
I might be messed up,
but I'm not that out of it.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.207
Strap his arm down.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.010
Am I going to be okay?

27:18.637 --> 27:19.887
I hope so.

27:26.854 --> 27:30.982
- I am selling my soul.
- Just a little piece.

27:31.275 --> 27:33.026
And you are getting
something in return.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.779
I said I was selling it,
I didn't say I was giving it away.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.282
That would be
immoral and stupid.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.576
All they've done
is add an antacid.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.244
- Does it work?
- Well, it's not the point.

27:43.370 --> 27:46.372
Of course it's the point.
He's not asking you to lie.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.082
He's not asking you
to do something illegal.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.917
He's not asking me
to do anything.

27:50.044 --> 27:51.169
He's not ordering you.

27:51.295 --> 27:54.130
He gave you a choice.
You chose your staff.

27:55.049 --> 27:57.133
I know this isn't easy for you.
You'll suffer.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.761
Vicodin sales in Jersey
will triple.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.138
But you are doing a good thing.

28:08.729 --> 28:12.273
Only you could feel like crap
about doing something good.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.026
Kidney and liver
cysts are both benign,

28:15.152 --> 28:17.028
and the lymph nodes
all came back clean.

28:17.154 --> 28:20.114
His left armpit node
has antibodies for CD11.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.200
Well, not enough to
indicate lymphoma.

28:22.326 --> 28:24.535
We never tested for
hairy cell leukemia.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.995
No, but we would have picked it up

28:26.121 --> 28:27.622
somewhere else
besides one lymph node.

28:27.748 --> 28:30.124
And his spleen
isn't enlarged.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.584
Size isn't everything.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.504
The spleen is the mother Iode
for hairy cells.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.717
- Let's cut it open.
- You can't biopsy his spleen.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.761
- It'll bleed like stink.
- In the senator's condition,

28:41.887 --> 28:44.680
a spleen biopsy could easily
cause sepsis and kill him.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.933
Why do you do this to me?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.810
Now if I kill him,
I can't tell the judge

28:48.936 --> 28:50.228
I had no idea of
the risks involved.

28:50.354 --> 28:51.479
His brain is
turning into mush,

28:51.605 --> 28:53.815
and he's at risk for more infections.
We have to do it.

28:53.941 --> 28:56.109
See? That'll sound
much better in court.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.985
Okay.
Go tell our human pincushion

28:58.112 --> 29:00.655
we'll be sticking him
one more time.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.783
Cuddy.

29:05.744 --> 29:09.831
- Don't you hate doing this?
- Yeah.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.181
What's up?

29:30.519 --> 29:32.061
You like me.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.774
Why?

29:39.486 --> 29:41.779
That's kind of a sad question.

29:44.074 --> 29:46.701
I'm just trying to figure out
what makes you tick.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.453
I am not warm and fuzzy,

29:48.579 --> 29:51.497
and you are basically
a stuffed animal made by Grandma.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.292
I don't think
that's why you're asking.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.627
I think this is
because of the speech.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.337
God, don't try
and pick me apart.

29:58.464 --> 30:03.050
Then why are you asking?
What do you want to hear?

30:23.363 --> 30:24.947
Hey, Senator.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.742
We need to do one more biopsy
on your spleen.

30:29.411 --> 30:34.373
I'll have to sign lefty.
My fingers aren't working.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.089
Have you been coughing a lot?

30:43.300 --> 30:47.220
- Does it hurt?
- It's like I can't get air.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.932
Is it from the toxo?

30:51.808 --> 30:55.770
No. This...
This is new.

30:57.397 --> 31:00.525
You don't need to sign.
We can't do the biopsy.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.078
The senator's breathing
is severely impaired.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.955
His O2 sat levels are at 89.

31:14.081 --> 31:17.250
His silver stain indicates
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.461
Another killer fungus.
Consistent with hairy cell leukemia.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.631
But we can't biopsy
his spleen. Respiratory distress.

31:23.757 --> 31:26.425
His platelets are 20 and dropping.
His blood won't clot worth a damn.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.219
There's gotta be
another way to diagnose hairy cell.

31:28.345 --> 31:31.430
No. His bone marrow's indeterminate.
Spleen biopsy's the only way to go.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.892
You know, when the Inuit go fishing,
they don't look for fish.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.693
Why, Dr. House?

31:44.069 --> 31:48.531
They look for the blue heron
because there's no way to see the fish.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.866
But if there's fish,
there's gonna be birds fishing.

31:51.118 --> 31:54.829
Now, if he's got hairy cell, what else
should we see circling overhead?

31:54.955 --> 31:57.081
He should have all
sorts of weird viruses.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.874
HTLV and ATLV.

31:59.001 --> 32:01.586
We can test for them.
Run the titers.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.549
These were your
brain waves at 2:45 a.m.

32:06.675 --> 32:10.261
Now, here it comes. There's an abrupt
jump from slow-wave sleep.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.307
This indicates
partial sleep arousal.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.685
Most common type is somnambulism.
Sleepwalking.

32:17.811 --> 32:20.229
That would explain
why I'm so tired when I wake up.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.024
Yes. And also why
you were pregnant.

32:23.817 --> 32:26.902
And the hickeys.
And the carpet burn.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.447
I had sex in my sleep?

32:29.573 --> 32:32.116
Sexsomnia is
a documented disorder.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.077
You said your ex
lives downstairs.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.329
I'll kill him.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.749
Okay. But he probably
didn't know that you were asleep.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.126
Sexsomniacs can
act pretty normal.

32:42.252 --> 32:45.588
I'm gonna write you a prescription
for a low-dose antidepressant.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.340
It'll let you sleep better.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.759
If you wanna save
yourself the $15 co-pay,

32:49.885 --> 32:51.719
you could have sex
while you're awake.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.138
He's my ex. I...

32:54.264 --> 32:55.514
You live in
the same building.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.892
You haven't had sex
with anyone else for a year.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.727
You sleepwalk
right into his arms.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.855
Call me crazy,
but I'm sensing unresolved issues.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.654
Negative for HTLV 1 and 2.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.073
And negative for ATLV
and everything else.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.200
It's not hairy cell.

33:15.202 --> 33:18.204
Hey. You really
gonna give that speech?

33:19.122 --> 33:22.541
- You got an opinion, too?
- I'm a little surprised.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.126
Frankly, I thought
you were too much

33:24.252 --> 33:26.671
of a self-absorbed ass
to do this for us.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.547
You're welcome.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.341
He's positive
for Epstein-Barr.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.135
So what? It doesn't
point to hairy cell.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.887
It's irrelevant.

33:46.316 --> 33:47.441
Hey!

33:49.027 --> 33:51.487
You didn't fall off the swings
when you were eight.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.282
- Six.
- Ever.

33:57.369 --> 34:00.329
- Give that back.
- We have to talk.

34:00.706 --> 34:04.625
You had an epileptic seizure.
That's how you bit your tongue.

34:05.335 --> 34:08.629
I haven't had
a seizure since I...

34:08.755 --> 34:11.424
What medication
did you take?

34:11.550 --> 34:14.885
No seizure since I was six.

34:15.011 --> 34:19.765
No drugs since I was 10.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.183
Yeah, that's it.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.102
Don't worry about
what the question is.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.895
Don't worry that you're
starting to feel dizzy.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.772
Just stay on message.

34:30.861 --> 34:32.069
My...

34:33.029 --> 34:35.906
My mother used to call...
Call it...

34:38.118 --> 34:39.326
"funny" something.

34:39.453 --> 34:41.120
- Phenytoin?
- Yes!

34:44.750 --> 34:46.959
Okay, okay. You're okay.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.254
It's okay.

34:54.134 --> 34:55.926
Everybody lies.

34:57.345 --> 35:02.224
Senator Gary H. Wright
of New Jersey had childhood epilepsy.

35:02.642 --> 35:06.645
He took phenytoin. That drug,
with the Epstein-Barr virus,

35:06.772 --> 35:10.107
is associated with common variable
immunodeficiency disease.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.193
T cells down, B cells down.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.986
Keeps you from
forming enough antibodies.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.864
See, the antibodies are basically
your defensive line.

35:17.407 --> 35:20.451
And your brain is
like the quarterback.

35:20.577 --> 35:24.872
And then the fungi are like blitzing
linebackers plunging up the middle.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.291
Your lungs are like...

35:28.293 --> 35:29.376
Okay,
you got two quarterbacks.

35:29.503 --> 35:30.461
CVID?

35:30.587 --> 35:34.298
That's a type of immunoglobulin
deficiency. I said that.

35:34.424 --> 35:37.468
Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea
when you said it.

35:37.594 --> 35:38.928
Then he got
the respiratory problem

35:39.054 --> 35:40.846
and he tested
positive for Epstein-Barr.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.765
That's pretty much
a childhood disease.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.559
That's another reason why Chase's
suggestion was idiotic.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.354
He got it when he was a kid.
Didn't get any symptoms until now.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.480
It happens.

35:49.606 --> 35:53.317
It gets triggered by stress,
like public speaking.

35:53.443 --> 35:56.737
So you're basing your diagnosis
on a virus that's relatively common

35:56.863 --> 35:58.155
and a drug he took
30 years ago.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.909
Start the senator
on IV immunoglobulin, stat.

36:02.035 --> 36:04.203
If he gets better, I'm right.
If he dies, you're right.

36:42.742 --> 36:43.951
Dr. House?

36:50.250 --> 36:52.001
- You faked that.
- No.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.004
Say "antiretroviral".

36:55.130 --> 36:55.963
Antiretroviral.

36:56.089 --> 36:58.090
Now, say it three times fast.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.050
We just got back
your latest blood results.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.970
Your white cells are up.
Your T cells are back over a hundred.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.388
Well, that's...
That's good, right?

37:04.514 --> 37:06.807
In a week?
That's terrific.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.767
You'll need medication
for the rest of your life,

37:08.894 --> 37:11.228
but other than that,
you're fine.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.022
Am I well enough
to run for president?

37:13.148 --> 37:14.857
Why not run for pope
while you're at it?

37:14.983 --> 37:15.983
Oh, come on.

37:16.109 --> 37:18.319
Kennedy had Addison's.
FDR had polio.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.029
Two of the best presidents
in the last hundred years.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.865
If they were running today,
they wouldn't stand a chance.

37:22.991 --> 37:26.201
So you figure you'd be surgeon general
if you didn't have the limp?

37:27.245 --> 37:29.246
No.
There's things I can't do.

37:29.372 --> 37:33.542
And like you said,
I have to live with reality.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.961
Well, then I'm running.

37:36.087 --> 37:36.962
Good for you.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.631
Now, don't get excited.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.759
He's right.
I... I won't win.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.011
Then why run?

37:47.057 --> 37:48.766
Oh, I see.
Your point being,

37:48.892 --> 37:53.062
the only way to make a difference
is to win every fight.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.861
But, hey, why listen to me?

38:00.987 --> 38:04.615
I own the company. I'm certainly
not to be trusted, right?

38:06.242 --> 38:08.243
Dr. Greg House,
on the other hand,

38:08.370 --> 38:13.499
has a reputation for integrity,
among other things.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.585
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. Greg House.

38:35.855 --> 38:39.400
"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals'
commitment to research excellence

38:39.526 --> 38:41.527
is exemplified by
their new ACE inhibitor,

38:41.653 --> 38:42.695
a breakthrough
medical approach

38:42.821 --> 38:45.030
that will protect millions
from heart disease."

38:56.710 --> 38:58.460
That's not a speech.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.088
I thought it was pithy.

39:01.214 --> 39:04.008
You got enough for
a press release anyhow.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.218
Foreman or Cameron.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.189
A few things
I forgot to mention.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.652
Ed Vogler is
a brilliant businessman,

39:23.778 --> 39:28.282
a brilliant judge of people,
and a man who has never lost a fight.

39:31.411 --> 39:35.205
You know how I know
that the new ACE inhibitor is good?

39:35.331 --> 39:37.041
'Cause the old one was good.

39:37.167 --> 39:40.169
The new one is really the same,
just more expensive.

39:41.004 --> 39:42.755
A lot more expensive.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.258
You see, that's another example
of Ed's brilliance.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.719
Whenever one of his drugs
is about to lose its patent,

39:48.845 --> 39:53.724
he has his boys and girls alter it just
a tiny bit, patent it all over again,

39:53.850 --> 39:56.727
making not just
a pointless new pill,

39:56.853 --> 39:59.271
but millions and millions of dollars.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.398
Which is good for everybody,
right?

40:01.524 --> 40:03.942
Except the patients.
But who cares?

40:04.069 --> 40:06.111
They're just so damn sick.

40:06.988 --> 40:08.947
God obviously never
liked them anyway.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.992
From all the healthy
people in the room,

40:12.118 --> 40:14.787
let's have a big
round of applause for Ed Vogler.

40:26.216 --> 40:27.800
I threw in a joke.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.189
I'm sorry.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.152
I should've taken
an extra couple of Vicodin

41:28.278 --> 41:29.278
and just held my nose.

41:29.404 --> 41:32.030
I'm guessing you did take
a couple extra Vicodin.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.490
True.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.371
You don't need to worry
about firing anyone.

41:40.248 --> 41:41.248
I'm leaving.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.459
Why?

41:49.757 --> 41:53.427
Is this another noble,
self-sacrificing gesture?

41:54.554 --> 41:55.804
Are you trying to
protect Foreman?

41:55.930 --> 41:56.930
No.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.933
So this is just,
"Don't fire me. I quit"?

42:00.560 --> 42:02.519
I'm protecting myself.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.151
You asked me
why I like you.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.946
You're abrasive and rude.

42:14.908 --> 42:18.827
But I figured, everything you do,
you do it to help people.

42:20.997 --> 42:22.623
But I was wrong.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.835
You do it
because it's right.

42:49.234 --> 42:52.945
There are only two ways
that I can deal with things.

42:53.363 --> 42:55.155
One is in my control.

42:58.868 --> 43:00.118
That's to leave.

43:07.168 --> 43:09.002
Goodbye, House.
