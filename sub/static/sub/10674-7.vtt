you should make weight.

02:41.999 --> 02:44.716
One for ourselves
and one for the white folks.

02:44.751 --> 02:46.835
And that's more important than ever now.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.671
You see something that make
you mad, you can't show it.

02:49.673 --> 02:51.506

07:53.777 --> 07:55.560

Have you got my letters?

17:29.619 --> 17:31.118
No.

17:32.905 --> 17:35.039
They said they cut into your brain.

17:35.074 --> 17:37.408
Maybe they took your memory of me.

17:39.817 --> 17:42.413
When I look at you, I see so much

17:42.465 --> 17:44.298
of your pa.

17:45.437 --> 17:47.610
I'm glad he's there to look after you.

17:49.138 --> 17:50.587
He taught me how to track.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.377
That's how I found you.

17:54.024 --> 17:54.715
But...

17:55.094 --> 17:57.344
I've seen him do some bad things.

17:58.763 --> 18:00.144
Do you remember Jay?

18:01.361 --> 18:03.650
He ever tell you

18:04.416 --> 18:05.435
He did.

18:05.438 --> 18:06.904

18:57.134 --> 18:57.891

19:00.587 --> 19:01.920
I know you're scared, so I'm just gonna

19:01.972 --> 19:04.132

19:06.260 --> 19:07.759

19:09.930 --> 19:11.547
I thought I'd take a walk by the river.

19:11.572 --> 19:13.207
Actually, that's not entirely true.

19:13.259 --> 19:14.496
My husband, he's traveling,

19:14.548 --> 19:16.735

MAN: If you're lying to me,
you'll have the marshal's office

You can wear my husband's shirt until we

19:50.387 --> 19:51.898
get your dress washed.

19:51.923 --> 19:54.556
And then we can have some food.

19:54.608 --> 19:56.019
How does that sound?

20:04.879 --> 20:06.735
Okay, let's just

Aah! (shrieks)

You're safe, sweetie.

You don't have to get in.

No bath.

20:35.232 --> 20:36.231
We'll just...

20:37.041 --> 20:38.932

21:03.010 --> 21:04.605
that you have no words for.

21:05.629 --> 21:07.712
They're scary

21:07.764 --> 21:08.985
and they're confusing

21:08.987 --> 21:09.608
and...

21:10.634 --> 21:11.954
and they make you sad.

21:13.214 --> 21:15.558
I know I can't say anything
that's gonna make

21:16.223 --> 21:17.605

31:06.689 --> 31:09.223
Been waitin' a while
for you to get back.

31:09.275 --> 31:12.014
I checked the crosses. They
gonna be ready for us tomorrow.

31:12.039 --> 31:13.861
I would've gone with you.

31:13.897 --> 31:15.787
Thought you were with Rosalee.

31:17.291 --> 31:18.646
What's all this for?

31:20.203 --> 31:23.204
You always talkin' about how
you want a tattoo like mine.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.707
So I had Ledger
help me make up some ink.

31:27.528 --> 31:29.660
Yeah. Okay.

31:41.594 --> 31:43.793
I've been thinkin' a lot
about last names lately.

31:43.999 --> 31:44.823
Why?

31:46.099 --> 31:48.142
You know, on the plantation,
I feel like I saw

31:48.167 --> 31:49.878
that Macon name everywhere.

31:50.233 --> 31:53.068
On work orders.
That iron gate at the bridge.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.527
Heard it everywhere, too.

31:55.274 --> 31:56.857
There's a lot of power in a name.

31:57.223 --> 31:58.735
There's history, kinship.

31:58.944 --> 32:00.479
It ties you to family.

32:01.664 --> 32:03.280
Now we gettin' closer to freedom,

32:03.996 --> 32:05.703
we gonna have a lot of choices to make.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.802
Where we gonna live.

32:08.535 --> 32:09.839
What we gonna do.

32:10.956 --> 32:13.274
Figure we ought to start with a name.

32:15.127 --> 32:16.495
Henry Hampton.

32:19.303 --> 32:21.183
Noah and Henry Hampton.

32:40.596 --> 32:42.395
You ain't got to cook for us.

32:42.988 --> 32:45.289
I mean, it ain't on you

32:45.324 --> 32:46.315
if you don't want to.

32:47.886 --> 32:48.948
I don't mind.

32:49.545 --> 32:50.827
It remind me of home.

32:51.628 --> 32:52.671
The big house?

32:53.500 --> 32:55.082
My momma.

32:57.357 --> 32:59.305
Yeah, forgot you left family behind.

33:03.409 --> 33:05.468
She could make a meal out of anything.

33:06.213 --> 33:08.060
They gives us scraps.

33:08.314 --> 33:10.188
We make a feast, she say.

33:12.398 --> 33:13.934
Maybe you teach me.

33:18.762 --> 33:20.195
I'd like that.

33:24.697 --> 33:26.161
- What you think about the name...?
- (gunshot)

33:26.163 --> 33:27.123
(screams)

33:27.616 --> 33:29.082
MAN: That was a warning shot!

33:29.118 --> 33:31.158
Move! Get inside, come on!

33:32.204 --> 33:33.670
MAN 2: We got you surrounded!
Come on out!

33:33.706 --> 33:35.038
They behind us, too.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.340
MAN 3: I'll give you
to the count of ten!

33:36.375 --> 33:38.125
- How we gonna get through 'em?
- Nine...

33:38.177 --> 33:39.760
- eight...
- Noah!

33:39.795 --> 33:40.596
seven,

33:40.621 --> 33:41.712
The gunpowder in the hut across the way.

33:41.714 --> 33:42.970
- six...
- We blow our way out.

33:42.995 --> 33:45.265
- five... four...
- We need fire.

33:45.300 --> 33:46.653
- three...
- The hut's too far.

33:46.655 --> 33:48.969

34:45.949 --> 34:47.416
It's hard to tell.

34:47.452 --> 34:48.614
Is he coming back?

34:51.039 --> 34:52.338
Go on now.

34:52.373 --> 34:54.623
These'll hold you over till lunch ready.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.676
(indistinct chatter)

34:56.710 --> 34:59.084
CARVER: It's not about holding the line.

34:59.109 --> 35:00.541
It's about pushing in...

35:01.762 --> 35:03.595
T.R., where's your head at?

35:04.375 --> 35:05.317
What do you say?

35:05.553 --> 35:06.686
Sorry.

35:09.724 --> 35:11.390
Getting too old to play with toys,

35:11.442 --> 35:12.525
young man.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.940
Yes, sir.

35:15.868 --> 35:17.780
How about you and I

35:17.815 --> 35:19.532
head over to the stables,

35:20.021 --> 35:21.651
get you up on a real horse, huh?

35:21.652 --> 35:22.985
What do you say?

35:23.037 --> 35:23.986
(horse snorts)

35:23.988 --> 35:26.122
There you go. (chuckles)

35:26.157 --> 35:27.725
How's that feel?

35:28.159 --> 35:29.375
Wobbly.

35:29.750 --> 35:32.128
Well, you just hold those reins tight.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.496
Let the horse know who's in control.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.111
Daddy, look.

35:36.056 --> 35:37.504
I see you, son.

35:38.336 --> 35:39.969
(whip cracks)

35:40.004 --> 35:42.728
Ha! Ha! Easy now!

35:42.780 --> 35:43.973
Why is he hitting him?

35:44.008 --> 35:45.007
TOM: They're training the horse.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.308
So it'll be able to be ridden.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.341
Just like the one you're on.

35:47.393 --> 35:48.388
But they're hurting him.

35:48.413 --> 35:49.713
It's a necessary measure.

35:50.133 --> 35:52.014
The horses are useless
to us in their wild state.

35:52.016 --> 35:53.349
They will break free

35:53.401 --> 35:55.518
unless you snap out
their will to resist.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.069
A good trainer knows that

35:57.105 --> 35:59.822
you have to take a horse from
its independent state of nature

35:59.857 --> 36:01.724
and create a dependent state,

36:01.759 --> 36:03.526
so they will become
more productive to our needs.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.744
(trainer shouting)

36:04.779 --> 36:06.829
- (horse snorting)
- Whoa!

36:08.948 --> 36:10.301
He doesn't seem to like it.

36:10.421 --> 36:11.200
<i>She.</i>

36:12.931 --> 36:14.203
You see, efforts are best spent

36:14.255 --> 36:15.217
breaking the females.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.206
Then she will pass along

36:17.208 --> 36:19.125
those learned traits to her foal.

36:20.151 --> 36:21.472
When you get 'em young enough,

36:22.281 --> 36:24.552
you can get them to do almost anything.

36:31.835 --> 36:33.472
Hey, James!

36:37.077 --> 36:37.973
Son.

36:39.805 --> 36:41.614
Look to the right, okay?

36:43.284 --> 36:45.651
Look as far as you can. Then left.

36:46.164 --> 36:47.372
As far as you can.

36:48.796 --> 36:51.068
Look at everything else in-between.

36:52.543 --> 36:53.626
I don't see anything.

36:53.661 --> 36:55.779
What you see is Macon land.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.080
All this is gonna be yours someday.

36:58.565 --> 36:59.800
Every acre.

37:00.291 --> 37:01.050
Hey, why don't you start

37:01.085 --> 37:02.384
learning what it is I do,

37:02.420 --> 37:03.913
'cause you gonna be me one day.

37:04.986 --> 37:06.590
And I'll own everything?

37:06.591 --> 37:07.817
Yes, sir.

37:09.927 --> 37:10.976
Even James?

37:11.012 --> 37:12.761
James, Stine...

37:12.814 --> 37:13.896
all the slaves.

37:13.931 --> 37:15.097
They're gonna be your property

37:15.149 --> 37:16.305
just like this horse.

37:20.271 --> 37:21.889
Your Grandpa Earl...

37:22.981 --> 37:25.216
he didn't think that this
whole plot was arable.

37:25.883 --> 37:26.813
You know what "arable" means?

37:27.945 --> 37:29.069
Good for growing crops.

37:29.530 --> 37:31.780
But I knew a man from up
north... a quarry master.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.666
He pulled out all the shale.

37:33.701 --> 37:35.997
All we had to do was plant more cotton.

37:37.309 --> 37:39.622
Now, I've improved upon this plantation

37:39.941 --> 37:41.625
out of love for this land,

37:42.093 --> 37:44.426
which is what I hope
you'll do when I'm gone.

37:45.465 --> 37:46.762
I can do that.

37:47.257 --> 37:48.631
You can, can you?

37:49.728 --> 37:51.067
(knocking)

37:52.822 --> 37:54.103
Pardon, massa, uh...

37:55.128 --> 37:56.188
can I have a word?

37:56.224 --> 37:57.640
Absolutely, Sam. Come on in.

37:59.848 --> 38:00.609
My son

38:00.645 --> 38:02.811
is becoming familiar
with the day-to-day operations

38:02.813 --> 38:04.613
of the plantation, so

38:04.649 --> 38:06.532
anything that you have to say,
you can say

38:06.567 --> 38:07.496
right in front of him.

38:10.625 --> 38:12.071
That desk is...

38:12.409 --> 38:15.117
that desk looking mighty fine in here.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.126
It sure does.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.369
It's a beauty.

38:17.662 --> 38:19.328
I remember when you made it, Sam.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.463
That's when I realized
that you had a gift.

38:21.769 --> 38:23.299
That's the first time you paid me.

38:24.074 --> 38:25.167
That's right, I did.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.602
You have a very good memory.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.053
I told you to save your money, right?

38:28.633 --> 38:30.005
Now that's very important, son.

38:30.007 --> 38:32.305
'Cause a man's only
as good as his savings.

38:36.398 --> 38:37.680
And I never spent the one!

38:38.451 --> 38:39.451
Good man.

38:40.197 --> 38:41.684
Now I want to spend them all.

38:43.053 --> 38:44.354
On what?

38:47.925 --> 38:49.525
You also said that, uh,

38:50.069 --> 38:52.277
I work hard enough one day,
I might be able to...

38:52.613 --> 38:54.236
I could buy my freedom.

38:58.044 --> 38:58.751
Sam...

38:58.786 --> 39:00.869
Now, massa, this, uh...

39:04.842 --> 39:06.844
There's near $100 in that jar.

39:07.701 --> 39:08.807
That's impressive.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.546
That's very impressive.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.134
But, Sam, truth be told,

39:14.185 --> 39:15.428
you're worth five of those jars.

39:16.803 --> 39:19.723
And I would be a very
bad businessman if I let

39:19.724 --> 39:20.923
my most prized nigger go.

39:22.669 --> 39:24.025
I ain't being clear.

39:24.892 --> 39:26.228
That ain't for my freedom.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.896
(clears throat)

39:28.732 --> 39:30.149
It's for James.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.073
James is just a boy.

39:38.791 --> 39:40.209
Where would he go without his family?

39:41.092 --> 39:42.127
He could stay with me.

39:42.605 --> 39:43.659
You could hire me out

39:43.711 --> 39:45.571
in the city, and you know
how hard I work.

39:45.624 --> 39:48.217
Just the other day, Mr. Calloway
he paid me ten dollars.

39:48.252 --> 39:49.918
Ten dollars for a chair I made for him.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.460
You know they'd pay more

39:51.472 --> 39:52.645
if they knew that money going to you.

39:52.670 --> 39:54.256
Now's not really the right time.

39:54.258 --> 39:55.724
But I'll consider your proposal.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.242
Massa, please.

39:57.928 --> 39:59.028
Mr. Bill, he,

39:59.397 --> 40:01.146
his eyes is stuck on James.

40:01.182 --> 40:02.431
He mad as a rattlesnake

40:02.433 --> 40:03.932
after what Rosalee done done.

40:04.325 --> 40:05.684
All right, I'll talk to Bill.

40:06.013 --> 40:06.902
Now I promised

40:06.937 --> 40:08.187
that I was gonna
get you back in that shop,

40:08.239 --> 40:09.571
and that is what I'm gonna do.

40:09.607 --> 40:10.693
You and James.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.908
I need you working on the grandstand

40:12.943 --> 40:14.956
for my nomination announcement.

40:29.593 --> 40:30.592
Yes, sir.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.254
Thank you, sir.

40:35.633 --> 40:37.716

40:56.753 --> 40:57.953

41:13.856 --> 41:16.388
My daddy says I can't see you anymore.

41:22.865 --> 41:24.230
But he also said

41:24.977 --> 41:26.560
I'll be in charge one day.

41:28.849 --> 41:31.019
Which means I can do whatever I want.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.825
I can be however I want.

41:35.806 --> 41:36.525
My daddy?

41:36.527 --> 41:38.568
He does whatever he wants.

41:39.768 --> 41:41.246
So when I'm in charge,

41:43.019 --> 41:44.534
I'm gonna make things different.

41:45.385 --> 41:47.559
'Cause I can make things different.

41:49.001 --> 41:50.506
Make 'em better.

41:52.280 --> 41:54.009
You really think so?

41:54.585 --> 41:55.432
Uh-huh.

41:56.297 --> 41:57.796
I do.

42:01.369 --> 42:02.521
I mean...

42:03.881 --> 42:05.435
might have to wait a while.

42:06.785 --> 42:07.809
How long?

42:09.104 --> 42:10.226
Ten years.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.394
Maybe longer.

42:18.784 --> 42:19.960
Remember...

42:21.505 --> 42:21.987
we promised

42:22.039 --> 42:23.952
we'd always share everything.

42:34.496 --> 42:36.151
I don't want your candy.

43:05.699 --> 43:07.082
(sniffles)

43:15.209 --> 43:16.489
I saw him, Daddy.

43:17.678 --> 43:18.877
You saw who?

43:18.929 --> 43:20.295
Sam.

43:20.347 --> 43:22.381
I saw him run.
