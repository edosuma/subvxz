01:39.700 --> 01:42.500
- Happy birthday, Alice.
- Hi, Dad.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.900
We got a new patient at the back.
Your kind of dog, you know?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.900
You can see him after school.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.700
He's so cute. Aw!

01:58.200 --> 02:00.800
Hey, little boy. Thanks, Dad.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.200
- Guess which hand.
- The right one.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.700
Yes.

02:29.500 --> 02:33.500
A locket. I love it.
Thanks, Mum. I love you.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.400
I love you too.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.500
Birthday girl.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.400
Oh, you're so silly!

02:50.600 --> 02:55.300
And straight to school. Happy birthday!

03:23.200 --> 03:26.000
Hi, boy. How are you?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.300
Did Dad fix you OK?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.200
No!

05:46.400 --> 05:49.800
Excuse me. Um...

05:50.600 --> 05:52.700
Is this hypoallergenic?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.300
- Hello there.
- Afternoon, Arthur.

06:26.500 --> 06:30.200
- Afternoon, boss.
- You here to keep your hand in?

06:30.400 --> 06:35.700
I would normally. The knee,
you see, not getting any better.

06:35.900 --> 06:38.000
That's why I got a younger man in.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.100
Steady hand, see.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.100
Just steady her there, yeah?

06:56.300 --> 06:59.600
Ah, there we are.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.800
Hello. I'm sorry, I was hoping
to get something for a headache.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.500
Sure. Come in.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.000
Headache, was it, Miss Brogan?

07:32.200 --> 07:36.800
- Mary. Are you all right?
- Yes, yeah.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.300
I... I didn't see anyone else come in.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.100
- Are you two togeth...?
- My niece. Deirdre.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.400
- Hi.
- She's visiting.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.000
- Looks like you need a refill.
- Right.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.400
Yeah, thank you.

07:54.500 --> 07:58.300
When did you do the place up?
It looks really different.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.400
- Just recently.
- Must be nine months.

08:00.600 --> 08:04.000
More, even, since they moved here.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.600
Ventolin. I need to see a prescription.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.500
I might have it here.
I do hold on to everything.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.700
- How long are you visiting for?
- What a relief.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.000
This expired last year.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.800
Hey.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.700
You all right?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.700
- What are you doing?
- You know what I'm doing.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.600
No!

09:59.300 --> 10:02.100
It's like a black hole in here.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.300
We're not just throwing
Alice's stuff away.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.900
- No, we can't keep them.
- D'you not understand?

10:08.700 --> 10:10.800
I'm not... I'm not ready.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.700
You'd forget her if you could.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.000
What can I do?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.400
You can let me go.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.800
It's not you, Patrick.
It's not because of you.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.600
You know what?
All I want is for you to be OK.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.900
Drive me to the station.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.500
What is it?

11:43.200 --> 11:46.700
We'll get some help at Arthur's place.
He'll know a mechanic.

11:51.900 --> 11:56.300
Listen. It's there when the wind dies.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.900
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.000
Brilliant.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.500
These look like gravestones.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.600
Car's there.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.600
- I'll try and call him.
- I'll check round the back.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.600
Let's go home.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.900
What happened?

14:58.400 --> 15:00.500
Louise.

15:08.100 --> 15:12.300
- Talk to me, will you?
- Look, I just wanna go to bed.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.100
Louise, Patrick.

15:27.500 --> 15:31.300
Arthur, what are you doing here?

15:31.500 --> 15:36.600
I just wanted to make sure that
everything's all right with you both.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.800
- What do you mean?
- Well, is it?

15:40.700 --> 15:43.000
Our car broke down
in the middle of nowhere.

15:43.100 --> 15:47.000
We walked to your place,
couldn't raise you.

15:47.100 --> 15:51.000
What is this, Arthur?
You just let yourself into our home?

15:51.200 --> 15:54.100
Country habits, I suppose.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.400
You say you came to my place.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.700
Well, that would make sense.

16:00.800 --> 16:05.300
- What the hell is this?
- All right, I'm going.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.300
You're doing a great job here, Patrick.

16:14.500 --> 16:20.200
We're so glad you chose Wakewood
and hope you've found solace here.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.900
Yeah, we're fine.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.600
And how about you, Louise?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.400
Is everything all right with you?

18:04.100 --> 18:05.400
Deirdre?

18:08.400 --> 18:10.400
- Are you...
- There you are, my pet.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.900
- I'm going home today.
- Is she OK?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.500
Fine, thanks.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.100
- Now...
- I can't wait to go back.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.900
I know, lovely. It's gone so fast.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.900
Um, uh...

18:29.000 --> 18:31.200
There. For the sunglasses.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Come on, darlir.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.200
Alice has a lovely voice.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.200
- Tell me my daughter's name.
- I don't know.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.200
- Tell me. Tell me my daughter's name.
- I don't know, truly.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.500
Her name was Alice.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.700
Now, how did you niece know that?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.700
What goes on in Wakewood
is not for everyone.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.800
And what goes on?

20:18.900 --> 20:22.100
Please, make another baby to love.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.900
I can't.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.500
I know how you feel.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.200
No, I don't think you do.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.800
Deirdre's not your niece.
So, then, tell me.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.600
You want to get your daughter back,
don't you?

20:57.700 --> 20:59.200
Is that possible?

21:01.600 --> 21:04.300
I can't say, and that's the truth.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.800
- Hello.
- Hey.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.900
I've gotta go over to O'Shea's.
Can you help?

21:16.100 --> 21:19.700
- I can't.
- Pick you up at ten?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.900
- Go on, go on. Get in there.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.600
Go on, get in there.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.400
Go on, get up there.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.900
- That's a bitch of a fever he's got.
- Yeah, he has all right.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.400
I'll give him a shot.
Can you prep 35 mil?

21:33.600 --> 21:36.600
And maybe get
an anti-inflammatory as well.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.600
Go on, get up.
Get up here! Go on. Get up there!

21:40.700 --> 21:44.300
- Move up. Move him up.
- Go up there.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.100
- Go on, get up. Get up, get up!
- He won't move, Da.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.500
Come on!

21:50.300 --> 21:51.500
Come on!

21:52.600 --> 21:54.000
- What are you doing?
- Let me see.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.600
- Shush, woman!
- I'll try and get him where he is.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.800
Keep still.

22:02.600 --> 22:06.100
We're gonna have to get him
up to the restraint. Go on! Go on!

22:06.200 --> 22:08.300
- Bad idea, Mick.
- Don't be upsetting yourself.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.900
- Get out of there, Mick!
- Come on! Come on!

22:11.700 --> 22:15.300
- Come on!
- Da, please! Da, please.

22:15.400 --> 22:20.600
Get out of there! Pull him up!
Pull him up! Pull him up!

22:30.500 --> 22:32.400
Open the front gate!

22:35.600 --> 22:38.400
I can't! It's stuck! Push it!

22:49.900 --> 22:52.500
Da! Da!

22:54.800 --> 22:57.100
Da.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.400
You did everything possible.

23:30.600 --> 23:34.000
I think you'd better find someone else
to run the practice.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.900
We're leaving Wakewood.

23:37.100 --> 23:39.400
It's been a shock to you.
We'll talk tomorrow.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.700
Arthur.

23:46.900 --> 23:47.900
We're not staying.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.400
Tell me about your daughter.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.200
- This isn't the time.
- I think it is the time.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.500
- Arthur...
- Listen to me.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.900
Listen to me.

24:05.400 --> 24:09.400
I can bring your daughter back to life
for a short time,

24:09.600 --> 24:14.400
so you can see her, hold her again
and say goodbye properly.

24:14.500 --> 24:18.200
- Would that ease your pain, hm?
- That's not funny.

24:18.400 --> 24:22.200
If she's been dead for less than a year,
I can bring her back.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.400
It's only for three days.
For most people it's enough.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.700
That is ridiculous. It is nonsense.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.600
All right. All right.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.900
But do one thing for me, Patrick.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.300
Before you deride my offer...

24:37.900 --> 24:38.900
...ask your wife.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.400
She knows.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.100
- I told you already.
- You didn't tell me anything.

24:53.300 --> 24:56.000
- Please, just stop this.
- Stop this? Stop what?

24:56.200 --> 24:58.200
- What is it you think I'm doing?
- Come on, babe.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.600
Please, come on, be straight with me.
What did you see?

25:02.900 --> 25:05.000
What did you see?

25:06.600 --> 25:08.700
I saw something like...

25:11.400 --> 25:12.400
What?

25:13.600 --> 25:16.700
A birth... maybe.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.500
And?

25:24.100 --> 25:26.100
I believe him.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.900
Patrick, I believe what Arthur said.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.500
If we do this, will you stay?

25:37.900 --> 25:40.000
Louise?

25:45.200 --> 25:47.100
I just want her back.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.900
OK.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.300
But it's not so simple, is it?

26:07.100 --> 26:10.100
If we have to lie, isn't it won'th it?

26:19.300 --> 26:21.000
- What was your daughter's name?
- Alice.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.600
Alice Hannah Daley.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.700
Alice Hannah Daley.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.000
- Did she prefer mornings or evenings?
- Mornings.

26:32.700 --> 26:35.500
- Was her skin moist or dry?
- Moist.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.500
Would she have liked
cats, cows or horses?

26:41.700 --> 26:44.000
Horses, ponies, definitely.

26:46.100 --> 26:50.100
- Was her hair thick or lank?
- It was fine. Wasrt it?

26:51.000 --> 26:52.600
Quite fine.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.300
- What time of the year was she born?
- October. 22nd.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.300
How long has your daughter
been in the ground?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.700
Patrick, how long has your daughter
been dead and buried?

27:12.200 --> 27:15.700
It's been eleven months,
two weeks, two days.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.700
This is what we can do.

27:28.900 --> 27:32.400
Your daughter will be brought back.
Make the most of the time.

27:32.500 --> 27:35.400
And after she'll go back to the woods.

27:35.600 --> 27:39.300
- She's just on loan.
- Will she be normal?

27:39.500 --> 27:42.600
Yes, quite. Her heart will beat,
her breath will breathe

27:42.800 --> 27:45.800
and she'll remember the time
she had with you, some of it.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.100
It lasts for three days only,

27:49.300 --> 27:53.400
during which you must keep Alice
within the townland of Wakewood.

27:53.600 --> 27:58.400
The wind turbines lie beyond
our boundary. Let them be your guide.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.600
This is a physical necessity.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.800
Why only three days?

28:05.200 --> 28:08.100
We tap the life force
of a fresh cadaver.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.500
Three days' won'th is all we get.

28:12.200 --> 28:15.400
Perhaps it mirrors the stages
of existence, birth, life, death.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.700
I don't truly know.

28:18.300 --> 28:23.000
Now, for this to work, we need a body,

28:23.200 --> 28:25.000
and, as you are more than well aware,

28:25.200 --> 28:28.900
we have recently had a tragedy
in the community.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.000
Perhaps we should prevail on the family.

28:33.200 --> 28:37.600
The ritual of the return
binds you to Wakewood.

28:37.700 --> 28:42.900
You will settle here permanently
and you will tend animals without fail

28:43.100 --> 28:45.600
whenever this town needs you.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.900
Do we have an agreement?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.500
We just wanna see her again.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.200
Then you shall.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.200
You were there. The vet's wife.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.900
Yes.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.900
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

29:59.900 --> 30:02.500
Mrs O'Shea,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

30:04.100 --> 30:06.400
In my mind, he's the young boy I met.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.800
Our daughter was killed last year.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.300
She was our only child.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.300
When she was born, it didn't go well.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.000
I can't have any more.

30:48.800 --> 30:53.100
I know this is
a terrible time for you, but...

30:54.800 --> 30:57.700
...I need to ask you
if we can use your husband's remains

30:57.900 --> 30:59.300
to help bring her back.

31:00.200 --> 31:03.900
- You don't know what you're asking.
- No, you're right. I don't.

31:06.800 --> 31:10.600
But I need to see her again.

31:11.400 --> 31:16.800
You live in Wakewood now, don't you?
But it's not part of you.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.700
You're just visiting maybe.
I can't imagine what that's like.

31:19.900 --> 31:21.900
We're all born here.

31:22.100 --> 31:24.900
Mrs O'Shea,
we're very happy in Wakewood.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.500
Stand up for me.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.000
- No, it's not right.
- What?

31:58.100 --> 32:00.100
I don't know what it is,
but it's not right. I won't do it.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.700
Peggy, they have to ask.

32:03.700 --> 32:05.600
You're upset.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.800
There is something I don't like.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
They have to ask you,
but you have to be amenable, Peggy.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.900
That's the only way this can continue.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.000
Do you not want
to see Mick yourself, hm?

32:20.900 --> 32:23.500
You wouldn't deny me Mick's return.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.600
They need your help.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.900
You'll need to provide a relic of Alice
for the ritual.

32:35.100 --> 32:36.100
Like what?

32:36.300 --> 32:38.300
In this case,
we're close to the time limit.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.500
Her favourite teddy?

32:39.700 --> 32:42.800
The relic needs to be
more closely connected. A lock of hair.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.700
We don't have anything like that.

32:46.900 --> 32:52.100
Whatever you provide,
it needs to be personal to Alice.

32:52.300 --> 32:55.100
In a corporal, physical way.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.400
Very much so.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.700
D'you understand?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
You think Peggy knows?

33:53.500 --> 33:55.500
You're ready?

36:22.100 --> 36:23.300
You're very welcome.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.200
Come.

36:35.300 --> 36:38.300
We have to crush his thorax first.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.800
In times past,
they did this with a lump hammer.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.600
Right, that'll do!

37:00.900 --> 37:03.400
Patrick, lend a hand.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.400
Now we cut the spinal cord.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.200
You do it for me, would you, Patrick?

37:42.900 --> 37:44.100
We need the relic.

37:50.900 --> 37:51.900
Very good.

38:04.200 --> 38:09.200
On the wild wind thee fly,
'tween this world and the next,

38:09.400 --> 38:12.600
from that twilight realm
you see o'er your perch

38:12.800 --> 38:16.500
the trials of the living
and the wake of the dead.

38:17.500 --> 38:21.300
Help us now call Alice,

38:21.500 --> 38:23.400
and bring her here for three days

38:23.600 --> 38:26.700
and afterwards return.

38:26.900 --> 38:30.400
Go to the trees. Lie among the roots.

38:31.300 --> 38:34.800
Go to the trees. Lie among the roots.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.700
Take these hands.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.800
Alice.

38:42.600 --> 38:46.200
- Take these bones.
- Alice.

38:46.300 --> 38:49.900
- Take this heart.
- Alice.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.500
And, Alice, take these eyes.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.700
Bring him down.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.000
Now we need living blood.
Female blood would be better.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.300
Cut me.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.800
Come, come.

39:41.700 --> 39:44.400
Stand back, stand back.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.900
Feel now the power of transformation

39:53.000 --> 39:55.900
course through your true selves.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.300
Look away, look away!

39:58.500 --> 40:00.300
Avert your gaze!

40:33.500 --> 40:37.400
Here she comes. Here she comes.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.400
Here she comes.

40:42.800 --> 40:46.000
Here she comes. Here she comes.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.000
Here she comes.

40:51.700 --> 40:55.400
Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.000
My baby. Alice.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.100
Your hair's grown so long.

41:31.700 --> 41:34.200
I had such a strange dream.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.500
It's over now.

41:40.800 --> 41:45.700
- Her eyes are brown.
- Yeah, Mick had brown eyes.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.000
- Where's Alice?
- Getting dressed.

42:35.800 --> 42:39.800
- Hey, sweetie.
- Did you sleep well?

42:39.900 --> 42:42.100
The house seems strange.

42:42.700 --> 42:46.700
- It...
- Yeah, it is. Um...

42:46.900 --> 42:50.600
- We came here for a break.
- I must have slept the whole way.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.800
Is this for real?

43:04.700 --> 43:06.300
After you.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.000
No, you're not gonna get me.

43:09.900 --> 43:11.000
Oh, Alice.

43:28.900 --> 43:32.300
- Come on, start counting.
- One, two, three, four,

43:32.400 --> 43:35.000
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

43:35.200 --> 43:38.700
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

43:38.900 --> 43:42.800
I'm coming, ready or not!

43:50.000 --> 43:52.700
- I got you!

43:52.800 --> 43:55.100
I found your father!

43:57.100 --> 43:59.700
He's my prisoner! You're next!

44:01.300 --> 44:03.300
Alice!

44:07.000 --> 44:09.600
Come on, baby! Where are you?

44:11.800 --> 44:13.900
Alice!

44:17.500 --> 44:19.600
Alice?

44:21.500 --> 44:23.100
Alice!

44:23.800 --> 44:25.800
Al!

44:26.700 --> 44:28.700
Alice!

44:28.900 --> 44:30.200
Come on!

44:43.700 --> 44:45.200
Alice.

44:45.300 --> 44:48.900
Oh, sweetie. Are you OK?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.300
What's that doing there?

44:52.500 --> 44:55.700
I don't know. Maybe somebody put it
there to ward off the other birds.

44:58.300 --> 45:01.600
- Hey, I found something.
- What?

45:01.900 --> 45:03.600
Pick a hand.

45:05.100 --> 45:06.900
- Pick another hand.
- Wrong.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.400
Do you remember when you got it?

45:12.500 --> 45:14.600
You gave it to me sometime.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.800
Come on, baby. Time to go.

45:36.300 --> 45:39.000
Mum, did you hear music last night?

45:39.200 --> 45:43.400
- What kind of music?
- Voices, singing my name.

45:57.900 --> 46:00.300
We'll take him home
and I can stitch him.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.300
He doesn't have a collar.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.100
- Dad.
- Uh-huh?

46:14.300 --> 46:16.300
Can I do it?

46:16.500 --> 46:18.800
Yeah, go and put
some of those gloves on.

46:21.600 --> 46:25.100
OK, hold it. Hold it really tight.

46:25.900 --> 46:28.000
Now, OK.

46:29.300 --> 46:33.800
Now, open that. Take that piece.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.600
Hang on. You pull that through and up.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.700
Like that.

46:43.200 --> 46:46.100
People shouldn't hurt animals,
should they?

46:46.300 --> 46:47.400
No, they shouldn't.

46:49.700 --> 46:53.000
And animals
shouldn't hurt people either.

46:53.200 --> 46:56.600
Well, that's kind of different,
you know?

47:04.000 --> 47:05.600
I'd heard you'd had a bit of trouble.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.600
- Could say that, yeah.
- Mm.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.300
- Dad, can we keep him?
- Well, I don't see why not.

47:12.500 --> 47:15.700
- Mum said we could.
- Oh, she did, did she?

47:15.900 --> 47:20.600
- I'm gonna call him Howie.
- Howie? Ooh, I like it.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.600
Don't make it hard to say goodbye.

47:45.100 --> 47:47.200
- Good night.
- Night.

47:47.900 --> 47:50.100
- Got some blankets for us.
- OK.

47:50.300 --> 47:54.700
Once upon a time, there was
a little tearaway called Alice.

47:54.900 --> 47:59.400
- No, called Louise.
- This about me, is it?

47:59.600 --> 48:02.900
OK, called Louise, and she lived
with her brothers and sisters.

48:03.100 --> 48:06.000
- And her sheepdog.
- And her sheepdog.

48:06.200 --> 48:09.800
And they lived in a big house on a hill
overlooking the city.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.300
And the house had a field
and an orchard.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.500
And every year the trees...

51:01.700 --> 51:04.200
Hello, Alice. How are you?

51:04.400 --> 51:06.700
How would you like
to come and ride our pony?

51:06.900 --> 51:09.200
Dad, I'm going pony riding.

51:09.400 --> 51:14.700
- Mrs O'Shea, it's very kind of you...
- Alice wants to ride our pony.

51:14.735 --> 51:17.300
And it needs the exercise.
I'll bring her back later.

51:17.500 --> 51:19.800
I'm sorry,
but, um, we made plans for today.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.400
- No, Dad, I want to go now.
- Calm down.

51:22.500 --> 51:25.700
- Mum, I've been invited pony riding.
- Oh?

51:26.900 --> 51:28.500
Why don't you all come?

51:30.600 --> 51:34.200
Tell you what, why we don't have
some breakfast and then we'll see.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.400
OK.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.400
Keep her awake.

51:46.100 --> 51:48.000
Now, would you like
to pop over a jump?

51:48.200 --> 51:51.000
D'you think she's ready?
She's hardly ever ridden.

51:51.200 --> 51:53.500
She'll be fine. She's a natural.

51:54.800 --> 51:57.400
See that? No bother at all.

52:02.600 --> 52:06.700
We have some tea and sandwiches
going inside. Would you like to come in?

52:07.800 --> 52:10.500
- Alice, are you ready?
- Let her finish up.

52:10.700 --> 52:14.300
We'll come in when she's done.
She won't be long, I promise.

52:29.400 --> 52:32.900
Alice, there's a game
you might enjoy playing.

52:38.700 --> 52:41.500
- What's the game?
- It's a quiz.

52:41.700 --> 52:46.000
I ask the questions, you answer,
I keep score.

52:47.500 --> 52:50.100
Now, Alice Daley, what is your name?

52:53.100 --> 52:55.300
Right, I see the way it is.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.600
Tell me, when you close your eyes
when you're tired,

52:57.700 --> 52:59.700
what do you see,
more yellow or brown?

52:59.800 --> 53:02.200
I see a big red shape.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.700
Go on, have another one there, Patrick.

53:06.900 --> 53:09.000
I think maybe we should check on Alice.

53:09.100 --> 53:11.900
- Yeah.
- They'll be back any minute.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.300
Let me see your hand.

53:31.200 --> 53:33.200
And what's your date of birth?

53:36.100 --> 53:39.400
I think I know, a little bird told me,
but if you're not more cooperative,

53:39.500 --> 53:41.800
I don't think
you'll be riding that pony again.

53:44.100 --> 53:48.000
Alice, are you a normal little girl?

53:50.200 --> 53:51.900
Why would you ask me that?

53:54.600 --> 53:58.100
- Why don't you look at me?
- I've seen enough.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.700
- What's up, sweetie?
- I don't like that woman.

54:09.400 --> 54:11.400
She's not right.
You've got to take her back.

54:14.200 --> 54:18.100
- Alice.
- Al, wait a sec.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.600
Alice!

54:22.600 --> 54:25.900
Peggy knows. Let's take our chances
and get out of Wakewood.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
Then we leave right now.
You go get the car.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.300
Hey, Alice!

54:38.700 --> 54:40.800
Mum's gonna come and pick us up, OK?

54:44.000 --> 54:46.100
Did Mrs O'Shea frighten you?

54:50.600 --> 54:51.700
Alice.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.900
- Alice!

55:05.600 --> 55:07.000
Open the door!

55:08.000 --> 55:10.200
- What happened?
- Open it!

55:10.400 --> 55:12.000
What happened to her?

55:13.700 --> 55:16.200
- Go back. Go back!
- Is she OK?

55:20.500 --> 55:23.700
- What happened?
- We tried to leave.

55:23.800 --> 55:25.900
What happened?

55:54.100 --> 55:56.200
Howie, good boy!

56:06.500 --> 56:08.600
We're trapped.

56:31.900 --> 56:34.000
Did you hear something?

57:05.200 --> 57:08.400
We must put Alice back in the ground
where she belongs.

57:08.600 --> 57:12.500
- Do it now.
- Three days. We have one day left.

57:12.700 --> 57:15.200
- We cannot delay.
- You tried to leave.

57:15.400 --> 57:18.600
Now, wait a minute.
She made Alice very frightened.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.800
- It was necessary.
- It was cruel.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.100
I'm disappointed.

57:24.000 --> 57:28.500
You have to obey the rules, Patrick.
I thought I made that absolutely clear.

57:28.700 --> 57:30.600
- Give up your last day.
- Do it now.

57:30.900 --> 57:34.100
- Put her back, to be safe.
- You're not taking her.

57:34.200 --> 57:37.600
- Louise, you'd better bring her now.
- You're not taking my baby.

57:37.800 --> 57:42.700
- We want you to do this.
- Mum. Why are they here?

57:48.400 --> 57:50.800
- It's OK.
- Three days, Arthur.

57:50.900 --> 57:53.700
I'll fight you and every one of you
if I have to. Do you understand?

57:53.800 --> 57:57.500
Patrick, we've come to talk,
and there are people here

57:57.700 --> 58:02.400
who believe there's something amiss,
something not according to plan.

58:02.600 --> 58:05.900
- Do you see any signs of that?
- No, I don't, none at all.

58:05.935 --> 58:08.400
You must tell me
if you observe anything unexpected,

58:08.600 --> 58:11.500
anything beyond what we discussed,
do you understand?

58:11.700 --> 58:14.900
The smallest detail
could have disastrous consequences.

58:15.100 --> 58:17.700
She's fine. She's our little girl.

58:19.900 --> 58:21.100
For one more day.

59:55.100 --> 59:56.900
Alice, wait here.

59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.000
Patrick?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.100
Oh, my God.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.700
I don't understand.
Why would they do this to Howie?

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.200
- Are we so sure that it was them?
- What are you saying?

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.800
Alice.

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.200
Show me your hands.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.400
- Is this a game?
- Yeah, it's a game.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.300
Alice, show me your hands.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.800
Alice, go to your room and play.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.500
Why?

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.800
- Louise.
- Go upstairs.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.900
This is Alice's last day.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.900
Today you must be strong for her.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.300
But she'll want to go herself.
You won't have to persuade her.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.000
Here's something for her to wear
around her neck.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.700
We call it a clutch.
You'll find it gives her comfort.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.000
Sure.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.700
If she becomes agitated,
you can fasten it about her wrists.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Mary, I need
to talk to my husband for a sec.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.600
I can't do this. I'm not ready. I can't.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.400
We could run.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.800
- This is all wrong.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.200
Hello?

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.500
Yeah, look, I'll come tomorrow.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.200
OK, 20 minutes.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.200
- No.
- I've got to.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.300
You want them all here again,
banging their sticks?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.700
You just keep her away from Alice.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.000
I'll come back before midnight
and we'll go to the woods.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.200
Alice?

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.800
Hey.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.300
Whers the baby coming?

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.900
What?

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.900
Alice?

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.200
Where are you?

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:06.700
- Anything you can do?
- We can put him out of his misery.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.900
Injection, is it?

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.000
No, he's too big.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.900
Alice. Alice! Baby...

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:27.300
Alice! Alice!

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.600
It's time to go to the woods.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.400
Interesting.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.200
Arthur.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.800
Get out of this house.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.900
Don't look at her.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.800
Ben, don't look at her.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.600
Look away.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.800
Don't look at her. Look away. Ben!

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.700
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.700
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.900
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.300
Back to the trees
and lie among the roots!

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.800
I'll see you later.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.399
Now...

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.200
That won't work on me.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Alice?

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.300
Patrick, is Alice here? Is she with you?

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.600
Listen, I think
Alice has done something...

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.000
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me, Louise.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200
Patrick, I'm pregnant.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.500
No, you're not.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.600
- No, you can't be. That's impossible.
- I know, but I am.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.800
Alice found out.
I... I mean, she already knew.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.700
I've looked everywhere for her.
I thought maybe she'd come here.

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.800
Yeah, yeah, I think she did come here.
Come and look.

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.400
Oh, my...

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.100
Where would she have gone?

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.400
Home, sooner or later.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.400
What the hell have we done?

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.000
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't know.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:03.800
There's some stuff on the road.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.000
Oh, my God.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.800
Oh!

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.200
Get in.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.700
Mum!

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.400
Alice?

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.800
- You were going to leave me.
- We didn't know where you were.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.700
I'm right here.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.700
Dad, am I dead?

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.300
I've got something for you, Alice.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.000
Do you want me to fasten it on for you?

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.000
Thanks, Dad.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:43.200
- Love you.
- Love you, Dad. And you too, Mum.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.700
I love you too.

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.100
I wanna stay with you.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.300
- What is it? What's happened?
- We found her in the woods.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.400
- It's all gone wrong.
- What have you done?

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.000
- I think she's stopped breathing.
- She'll not stay that way.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.100
- You have the clutch I gave you?
- No, it's not here.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.400
May we all survive.

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.200
Please put me down.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.000
I don't wanna go back.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.300
I don't want to be on my own again.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.600
Why are you making me do this?

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.700
We're almost there.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.800
Patrick?

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:31.500
Come now, Alice. It's time.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.100
Alice!

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.500
Stop!

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.400
Mum.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.700
11 months, two weeks and two days.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.800
- Well, you fooled me, Patrick.
- We wanted to see her again.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.400
- You wanted to keep us here.
- How long has she been dead?

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600
A year...

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.900
A month, a couple of days.
Let me go. I can help.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.100
The clutch will release you
when she's back in the ground.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.600
- Mum!
- Arthur, she'll kill my wife!

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.900
Where are you?

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.400
I hope not.

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.200
Mum!

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.800
Dad!

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.800
Alice!

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.900
Alice!

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.100
Alice!

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.600
Mum!

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.900
Alice, it's me!

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.000
Hey, sweetie.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.100
Why did you run away?

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.800
I was scared.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Are you still scared?

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:40.300
- Not really.
- I bet you are.

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:47.600
- Maybe just a little bit.
- You could come to me now, though.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.900
I know, but...

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.100
...l'm a little tired.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.000
Mum.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:00.200
Yes, sweetie.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.500
Can I have a hug?

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.300
Course you can.

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.900
I'm sorry.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.600
It's OK. Off to bed.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.500
Off to blanket street.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.200
Almost there.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.400
I'll just make up the bed.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.100
There we go.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.700
Are you comfy?

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:24.100
Once upon a time there was a little girl

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.100
who went for a long walk in the woods.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.600
She walked and walked

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.400
until she discovered
she had lost her way,

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.900
and although the darkness
was drawing near,

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:43.200
the little girl knew
she didn't have far to go.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.700
The cottage and safety
were only a few steps away.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.500
A few short steps and she would be happy
for ever and ever.

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.900
The door opened...

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:09.100
...and her mum and dad
took her into their arms...

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.700
...and into the warmth.

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.700
And the door closed

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:21.800
on the cold and the darkness...

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.700
...and the night.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.400
Louise.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.800
- Help me!
- Patrick!

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.500
Help me!

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.900
No!

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:23.200
Louise! Louise!

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.800
Louise!

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
They've gone, Patrick.

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:38.000
You won't find them.

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:44.600
I tried to warn you
there'd be consequences.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.500
So, how is it?

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.800
It's OK.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.700
- And Alice?
- She's great.

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.800
We miss you.
She's hoping for a baby sister.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.900
Really?

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.700
How much do you remember?

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.200
I don't really know.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.300
I'll be there in a minute.
