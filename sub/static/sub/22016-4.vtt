00:02.362 --> 00:04.573
I wonder
what Manny's doing right now.

00:04.932 --> 00:06.131
Why don't you call him?

00:06.198 --> 00:07.924
<i>You</i> call him.
I don't care what he's doing.

00:07.991 --> 00:09.073
I'm trying not to bug him.

00:09.140 --> 00:12.038
He said that he needed some
time to adjust to college,

00:12.108 --> 00:13.701
- so I'm giving him...
- Stop the car!

00:15.852 --> 00:17.155
Why would you do that?!

00:17.222 --> 00:18.553
I think that's Shorty.

00:19.991 --> 00:21.760
Shorty and I have been
best friends

00:21.827 --> 00:23.241
for as long as I can remember.

00:23.639 --> 00:25.753
He and his wife, Darlene,
moved to Costa Rica

00:25.820 --> 00:29.028
a few years back for, uh...
I don't know why.

00:29.334 --> 00:31.639
Ruin his life eating beans,
fighting malaria,

00:31.706 --> 00:33.428
drinking water people bathe in?

00:33.495 --> 00:34.545
This.

00:34.616 --> 00:37.246
This is when you sound racist!

00:37.983 --> 00:39.878
You come to town and
you don't tell me?

00:39.953 --> 00:41.370
I ought to punch you in the neck,

00:41.437 --> 00:42.756
- you son of a bitch.
- Jay!

00:42.885 --> 00:44.392
I want to kick you in the knee,

00:44.459 --> 00:45.575
you stupid idiot!

00:45.642 --> 00:46.798
That might not be a thing.

00:46.865 --> 00:48.467
You're a terrible best friend.

00:48.534 --> 00:50.639
Don't yell at me.
I'm only here a couple of days.

00:50.706 --> 00:52.963
It was last-minute.
I was gonna call.

00:53.803 --> 00:54.803
This Joe?

00:54.909 --> 00:55.919
You're huge.

00:56.037 --> 00:57.670
Eh, I can be bigger.

00:57.751 --> 00:59.416
What are you doing?
Where are you staying?

00:59.570 --> 01:01.147
I'm checking in at the
hotel over there.

01:01.205 --> 01:02.260
No hotels.

01:02.327 --> 01:04.215
You're as bad with money
as you are with pants.

01:04.274 --> 01:05.649
What's going on down there,
anyway?

01:05.707 --> 01:06.754
These?

01:07.139 --> 01:08.167
Palazzos.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.452
Never felt so comfortable.

01:09.534 --> 01:11.468
Everything goes
where it wants to go.

01:12.562 --> 01:14.873
Shorty, why don't you
come and stay with us?

01:14.957 --> 01:16.231
You will even get your own room

01:16.298 --> 01:17.702
'cause Manny's off to college.

01:17.769 --> 01:19.694
College?! How's he doing?

01:19.809 --> 01:22.486
I wish I knew.
He needed some space.

01:22.553 --> 01:25.483
In the meantime, she sends him
a care package the size of a Fiat,

01:25.603 --> 01:27.689
which included a pack
of my favorite sausage.

01:27.756 --> 01:29.342
- I did not put the sausage...
- Well, where did it go, then?!

01:29.399 --> 01:30.411
I know what I ate!

01:30.478 --> 01:32.323
There's too many things
upsetting me right now.

01:32.390 --> 01:33.761
Go get your stuff.
Meet us back

01:33.828 --> 01:34.994
at the house. It's done.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.231
- You got it!
- Yes!

01:36.298 --> 01:38.302
It's gonna be so nice
since Manny's gone

01:38.369 --> 01:40.739
to have somebody fun
again in the house.

Are you ready for this, big boy?

01:57.759 --> 01:58.814
Oh, I'm ready.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.314
And it's gonna get pretty messy.

02:01.381 --> 02:02.543
Mm!

02:02.610 --> 02:05.016
So, do you want to be blue or gold?

02:05.087 --> 02:06.197
I'll be blue.

02:06.298 --> 02:07.390
'Cause I'm cool...

02:07.460 --> 02:08.806
Aah! That tickles!

02:08.905 --> 02:11.401
Claire recently went to
a bachelorette party

02:11.468 --> 02:14.171
where they gave everyone
a passion painting kit.

02:14.241 --> 02:16.082
The idea is that
you and your partner

02:16.149 --> 02:17.835
cover one another in paint...

02:18.304 --> 02:19.624
get down on the canvas.

02:19.694 --> 02:23.335
And then get down on the canvas.

02:23.718 --> 02:25.912
Stop squirming, Phil.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.073
- I'm never gonna get this paint on you.
- Okay, I'll do you.

02:28.130 --> 02:30.335
You're gonna be so gold,
you'll like an Oscar.

02:31.155 --> 02:33.312
- So many people to thank.
- Oh, yeah.

02:35.566 --> 02:37.155
Oh, crap, it's Alex.

02:37.222 --> 02:38.252
Just ignore it.

02:38.319 --> 02:40.040
I can't.
What if something's wrong?

02:40.921 --> 02:42.630
Hi, honey. Everything okay?

02:42.697 --> 02:44.202
Yeah, I'm just,
uh, letting you know

02:44.259 --> 02:45.519
I'm sleeping at home tonight.

02:45.586 --> 02:47.046
Uh, h-how far away are you?

02:47.113 --> 02:48.132
About 20 minutes.

02:48.220 --> 02:50.344
Oh, that leaves 10
minutes for cleanup.

02:50.484 --> 02:53.523
Also, is it okay if, um,
Ben stays over tonight?

02:53.590 --> 02:54.609
Sure.

02:54.676 --> 02:56.634
I guess
if his mommy says it's okay.

02:56.701 --> 02:58.312
Mom, you don't
have to take a shot at Ben

02:58.369 --> 02:59.429
every time he comes up.

02:59.496 --> 03:01.491
Yeah, right, like
I wouldn't ask my mom.

03:01.558 --> 03:03.006
I'm really supposed to ignore that?

03:03.073 --> 03:04.371
Listen, he <i> is</i> my boyfriend,

03:04.438 --> 03:07.095
- and I'm getting <i> really</i> tired of this.
- Oh, calm down.

03:07.153 --> 03:08.776
- It was just a joke.
- Well, it's not funny!

03:08.833 --> 03:10.481
When you attack Ben,
you attack me.

03:10.548 --> 03:11.804
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

03:11.871 --> 03:13.484
Ugh!

03:13.554 --> 03:14.757
Now, where were we?

03:14.827 --> 03:16.991
Honey, I kind of think maybe
the moment has passed.

03:18.553 --> 03:20.243
Ohh, it's my dad.
What now?

03:20.310 --> 03:21.315
Just ignore it.

03:21.382 --> 03:23.523
I can't. What if something's wrong?

03:23.921 --> 03:25.346
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Dad.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.502
Shorty's in town!

03:26.569 --> 03:28.521
I need that set of golf
clubs I gave to Phil.

03:28.588 --> 03:30.831
That bonehead's certainly not
putting them to any good use.

03:30.888 --> 03:33.044
Why, Dad? Why do you
always have to attack him?

03:33.111 --> 03:34.881
Oh, calm down.
It was just a joke.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.715
I'll pick them up in the morning.

03:36.991 --> 03:39.359
He pisses me off so much!

03:39.648 --> 03:41.135
Come on! Let's do this!

03:41.202 --> 03:42.726
This doesn't feel like it's about me.

03:42.793 --> 03:44.844
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

03:45.006 --> 03:46.400
What?

03:47.418 --> 03:49.136
What's been going on with you lately?

03:49.203 --> 03:50.289
You look so handsome.

03:50.356 --> 03:51.488
Oh, well, thank you, sweetie.

03:51.545 --> 03:54.480
You know what, I added
a serum step to my skin-care regimen.

03:54.547 --> 03:55.746
W-Wait a minute.

03:55.852 --> 03:57.652
You're just angling for
horseback-riding lessons,

03:57.709 --> 03:58.411
aren't you?

03:58.480 --> 03:59.499
- Come on!
- No.

03:59.566 --> 04:01.069
You're not gonna become one
of those over-scheduled kids

04:01.126 --> 04:02.549
that burns out at 13

04:02.616 --> 04:04.066
and wears combat boots to the beach.

04:04.168 --> 04:05.932
I'm the least-busy Asian
kid in my school.

04:05.999 --> 04:07.604
Great. Take the other
end of this sheet

04:07.671 --> 04:09.262
and help me make up
the bed for Lionel.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.026
- Lionel's staying here tonight?
- Yes.

04:11.093 --> 04:12.805
Pepper and Ronaldo are
dropping him off.

04:12.872 --> 04:14.553
Last year,
Pepper and Ronaldo told us

04:14.620 --> 04:15.990
that they wanted
to become parents

04:16.057 --> 04:17.904
and were on a quest to
acquire Rihanna's eggs.

04:17.971 --> 04:20.151
And we said,
"Or, you rich queens",

04:20.226 --> 04:22.225
you could provide a home
for a child that needs one."

04:22.282 --> 04:23.315
So they adopted,

04:23.382 --> 04:25.354
and we are a little nervous
about how it's going

04:25.421 --> 04:27.947
because, um, when they first
introduced us to Lionel,

04:28.014 --> 04:29.945
we could tell that it
wasn't a great fit.

04:30.147 --> 04:32.250
Hi, Lionel,
it's nice meeting you.

04:32.370 --> 04:33.852
Hey. Cool shirt.

04:33.927 --> 04:35.711
It's a basketball costume.

04:35.961 --> 04:36.989
Jersey.

04:37.180 --> 04:38.585
Jersey. Right.

04:38.652 --> 04:40.478
Like "Jersey Boys."

04:40.579 --> 04:42.606
Okay, somebody fix me a drink.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.508
We just got cheeseburgers
out of a window

04:44.575 --> 04:45.686
and ate in our car.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.862
Do we have to disclose
that when we sell it?

04:47.929 --> 04:49.777
It seemed like a bit of a rocky start,

04:49.844 --> 04:51.173
but Pepper said it's going well.

04:51.246 --> 04:52.561
Parenting does change you.

04:52.637 --> 04:54.795
You know, before Lily, I
could be so dramatic.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.536
Oh, and I used to be so uptight.

04:56.603 --> 04:57.759
- But look at us now.
- Oh, sorry.

04:57.816 --> 05:00.050
Okay, your hand almost
went in my mouth.

05:00.215 --> 05:01.513
Come in, come in.

05:01.580 --> 05:03.325
Ohh! I like this!

05:03.392 --> 05:06.287
It's a lot better than
what was here before.

05:06.444 --> 05:08.013
Uh, our kitchen was there before.

05:09.253 --> 05:10.776
Am I being unclear?

05:10.886 --> 05:13.573
Okay, well, Lionel,
don't you look sharp?

05:13.756 --> 05:16.459
It's Burberry
from Harrods in London. Right?

05:16.526 --> 05:18.440
Ohh, you wonderful child.

05:18.546 --> 05:21.193
You won't need those
flashcards much longer.

05:21.412 --> 05:23.150
Here, for Lionel's stay...

05:23.217 --> 05:24.998
some snacks, toiletries,

05:25.092 --> 05:28.084
a design magazine you two
could also flip through.

05:28.151 --> 05:29.196
Okay, so, Lionel, uh,

05:29.263 --> 05:30.740
we have you set up here
in the den.

05:30.807 --> 05:31.779
That's where the TV is,

05:31.846 --> 05:34.670
and Cam tells me that
we have a sports package.

05:34.737 --> 05:35.737
That's okay.

05:35.837 --> 05:37.154
I should practice my cursive.

05:37.221 --> 05:39.277
Pepper says penmanship is a lost art.

05:39.344 --> 05:40.999
Yes. As are thank-you notes,

05:41.066 --> 05:42.408
which is why we can only assume

05:42.475 --> 05:44.318
you enjoyed our anniversary gift.

05:44.490 --> 05:47.386
Anyway,
we have to get to the airport.

05:47.737 --> 05:49.425
How do we say goodbye,
Lionel?

05:49.542 --> 05:50.808
<i>Au revoir.</i>

05:50.917 --> 05:52.500
Come walk us to the door.

05:52.722 --> 05:54.003
What have they done to him?

05:54.070 --> 05:56.386
Turned him into a little black Pepper.

05:57.719 --> 05:59.175
It's so infuriating.

05:59.243 --> 06:00.984
She treats you like
you're not even a man.

06:01.051 --> 06:02.386
Doesn't that bother you?

06:02.526 --> 06:03.941
You know, if you please everyone,

06:04.008 --> 06:05.458
you're not making enough progress.

06:05.525 --> 06:06.825
Cheryl Sandberg.

06:07.355 --> 06:08.472
Hey, is this garbage?

06:08.539 --> 06:09.576
I don't know.

06:09.643 --> 06:10.711
What's in it?

06:10.778 --> 06:14.194
Uh, "Passion Painting Erotic Art Kit"?

06:14.261 --> 06:15.706
What is <i> that?</i>

06:16.894 --> 06:18.409
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

06:18.520 --> 06:19.589
Ew!

06:19.670 --> 06:20.987
Gross! Ugh! Uh.

06:21.855 --> 06:23.007
You know what?

06:23.074 --> 06:25.409
If she wants to belittle you
like you're some child,

06:25.476 --> 06:26.790
we are going to use this

06:26.857 --> 06:28.297
to show her
what kind of man you are.

06:28.359 --> 06:30.334
I don't want to get paint
on my T-shirt and socks.

06:30.401 --> 06:32.797
Well, maybe you'll just have
to take them off for this one.

06:35.081 --> 06:36.711
Morning! How's my guy?

06:36.778 --> 06:39.165
Awful. I had a zillion nightmares.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.392
I was talking to Shorty,
but gee, that's rough.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.427
Hey, let's have breakfast
at my club today.

06:43.494 --> 06:45.614
We do a thing on Friday called
"Yesterday's Potatoes."

06:45.679 --> 06:47.122
They take last night's
French fries

06:47.189 --> 06:48.443
and make 'em
into today's home fries,

06:48.500 --> 06:50.847
and last night's fries
were fantastic.

06:50.914 --> 06:53.371
Sounds delicious, but, uh,
Gloria already cooked.

06:53.438 --> 06:55.003
Two poached eggs, chorizo,

06:55.070 --> 06:56.859
and a croissant with blackberry jam.

06:56.926 --> 06:58.301
- Yes!
- Manny's favorite.

06:58.368 --> 06:59.777
Geez, why don't you just call him?

06:59.844 --> 07:01.492
I made it out of habit.

07:01.577 --> 07:04.164
But thankfully, Shorty loved it.

07:04.231 --> 07:05.786
Didn't you, Papi?

07:05.853 --> 07:07.003
Okay, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you

07:07.060 --> 07:08.550
- get out of those pajamas...
- What pajamas?

07:08.607 --> 07:10.598
And then come sit while I...
Those aren't pajamas?

07:10.665 --> 07:13.136
No. Actually, Gloria and I are
gonna go to the farmer's market

07:13.203 --> 07:14.878
after we drop Joe off at school.

07:14.945 --> 07:16.679
- Why?
- It's kind of work-related.

07:16.819 --> 07:19.487
Your friend has a very
successful juice business

07:19.554 --> 07:21.115
in Costa Rica.

07:21.182 --> 07:22.763
They call me the Fruit King.

07:22.830 --> 07:24.790
They must have seen the outfit.
I'll tell you what.

07:24.847 --> 07:26.727
I got a little thing this
morning at the office.

07:26.794 --> 07:27.998
Why don't we meet
back here at 1:00

07:28.055 --> 07:29.714
for a little best-friend catch-up?
Deal?

07:29.781 --> 07:31.025
Deal. Sounds good.

07:31.092 --> 07:32.158
You know
what <i>doesn't</i> sound good?

07:32.215 --> 07:35.011
One grown man calling another
grown man his best friend.

07:35.276 --> 07:37.354
She doesn't get us. See you, buddy.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.544
What is that?

07:39.611 --> 07:41.597
Crostini with edamame puree.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.170
Pepper says anyone who's
still doing tomato-basil

07:44.237 --> 07:45.837
missed the boat, or should have.

07:45.904 --> 07:47.294
Hey, Lionel, you don't have to eat

07:47.361 --> 07:48.661
that stuff they brought for you.

07:48.755 --> 07:51.231
We... We won't tell. Ch...
Pop a Cheeto. Be a kid.

07:51.298 --> 07:52.643
But the guys went to the trouble

07:52.710 --> 07:54.060
of making Rosa make this for me.

07:54.127 --> 07:55.173
I should finish it.

07:55.314 --> 07:56.965
Hey, Lionel, heads up. Catch.

07:57.072 --> 07:58.121
No, thank you.

07:58.188 --> 08:00.357
Pepper and Ronaldo don't allow
ball play in the house.

08:00.424 --> 08:03.060
Well, you aren't <i>at</i> Pepper
and Ronaldo's house.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.318
This is a <i> fun</i> house. So...

08:05.449 --> 08:06.731
Yeah, that's what <i>they</i> call it.

08:06.798 --> 08:08.443
Well, now I feel like
throwing something,

08:08.510 --> 08:10.482
so, hey, Lionel, heads up. Catch.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.529
Uh, I'm sorry.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.819
I told Pepper I couldn't
move my arms in this jacket,

08:16.886 --> 08:18.231
but he said, "Fit over function."

08:18.298 --> 08:19.912
- No, you know what? I-It's fine.
- It's fine.

08:19.969 --> 08:20.980
- Things break.
- I'll pay for it.

08:21.037 --> 08:22.564
No, you won't.
We got it for free

08:22.631 --> 08:24.353
when we opened a credit
card at the gas station.

08:24.410 --> 08:27.064
I insist. I have traveler's
checks in my bag.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.590
No, Lionel, it's f... okay.

08:28.657 --> 08:30.207
No, you know what,
this is upsetting me.

08:30.264 --> 08:31.665
He dresses the way they
tell him to dress.

08:31.722 --> 08:33.092
He eats what they tell him to eat.

08:33.183 --> 08:34.610
I know. They control his every move,

08:34.667 --> 08:37.075
and he clearly feels pressured
to go along with it.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.610
That's probably why
he keeps telling me

08:38.667 --> 08:40.291
how lucky I am to live here.

08:40.379 --> 08:42.597
He said that? Wh...
Why didn't you tell us?

08:42.664 --> 08:43.884
You guys don't leave
a lot of space

08:43.941 --> 08:46.365
- to jump into your conversat...
- You know what this is, Cam?

08:46.422 --> 08:47.887
He's obviously jealous of Lily

08:47.954 --> 08:50.129
because we allow her to
be a kid and have fun.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.346
Imagine how jealous he'll be

08:51.413 --> 08:54.118
when he finds out about my
horseback-riding lessons.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.951
- Let it go.
- We're not doing that.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.713
You know what
I'm in the mood for?

08:58.780 --> 09:00.576
And I know it sounds
crazy, but waffles.

09:00.717 --> 09:01.801
What the hell?

09:01.868 --> 09:04.326
You're right.
You keep me from flying too high.

09:04.393 --> 09:06.417
"Happy early birthday, Mom.

09:06.484 --> 09:08.989
"Love, Alex and Ben."
Oh, my God.

09:09.056 --> 09:10.763
I know. Your birthday
isn't for six months.

09:10.830 --> 09:12.185
No, Phil!

09:12.548 --> 09:13.612
Oh.

09:14.129 --> 09:15.471
- Ew.
- Mm.

09:15.538 --> 09:17.896
Hey, guys.
Cool painting. Who did it?

09:17.974 --> 09:19.416
Alex and Ben.

09:19.483 --> 09:21.402
Oh, I think I heard them
making it last night.

09:21.469 --> 09:22.881
She kept saying he was doing it wrong,

09:22.938 --> 09:24.271
but it looks good to me.

09:24.342 --> 09:26.138
I mean, I don't know
anything about art,

09:26.205 --> 09:28.068
but... I know what I like.

09:28.225 --> 09:29.920
Oh.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.036
I make one comment about Ben's mommy,

09:32.103 --> 09:33.555
and Alex does this.

09:33.622 --> 09:34.903
It's aggressive.

09:35.045 --> 09:37.779
I remember when she made a
turkey with her handprint.

09:37.872 --> 09:39.955
She's just trying to get
some sort of reaction

09:40.022 --> 09:41.049
out of me, isn't she?

09:41.116 --> 09:42.564
But you're not gonna
take the bait, right?

09:42.621 --> 09:44.278
- You're bigger than that.
- I don't know, Phil.

09:44.335 --> 09:46.240
This is... This is very disrespectful.

09:46.307 --> 09:48.279
I think she needs to
be taken down a peg.

09:48.373 --> 09:50.470
So then, you'll just sit her
down and talk to her, right?

09:50.527 --> 09:52.185
I <i> could</i> do that,

09:52.287 --> 09:55.794
maybe over
dinner with her and Ben...

09:55.861 --> 09:57.482
There you go.
I'm proud of you.

09:57.549 --> 09:59.998
A dinner no one will soon forget.

10:00.428 --> 10:01.467
Fine.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.357
But know that I'm having a waffle.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.812
This is what you're
doing to our family!

10:07.724 --> 10:08.973
Stop.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.240
You know the rules. Helmet.

10:14.287 --> 10:15.587
Off with you.

10:16.399 --> 10:17.921
Shorty, you're kidding.

10:17.988 --> 10:19.666
I never joke when it comes to fruit.

10:19.733 --> 10:22.717
That miracle in your hand is
a half plum, half apricot.

10:22.857 --> 10:25.006
There was a time they could
only accomplish that in juice.

10:25.063 --> 10:27.367
- Oh.
- Jay.

10:27.466 --> 10:30.018
Oh, sorry, I kind of
lost track of time.

10:30.085 --> 10:31.280
Hey, no worries.

10:31.442 --> 10:33.762
Who among us hasn't blown
off his best friend

10:33.829 --> 10:36.339
he hasn't seen in four years
to go fruit shopping?

10:36.685 --> 10:40.295
Sounds like somebody could
use a Pomegrapefruit Blast.

10:40.362 --> 10:42.154
Blast means "yogurt."

10:42.281 --> 10:44.146
You've been spending too
much time in the jungle.

10:44.203 --> 10:46.099
What you need is a
little civilization.

10:46.204 --> 10:47.439
Let's go bowling.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.201
Well, I would love to, but, uh...

10:49.403 --> 10:51.867
I kind of want to take a nap
before we got to the theater.

10:52.588 --> 10:54.443
Um, you're taking
Shorty to the theater?

10:54.510 --> 10:57.131
Ah, yes.
I got the tickets for me and Manny,

10:57.198 --> 11:00.749
but he can't go and
Shorty loves "Wicked."

11:00.816 --> 11:03.833
He thinks he's a Galinda and
his brother an Elphaba.

11:03.908 --> 11:05.225
You know what you're doing, don't you?

11:05.282 --> 11:06.694
You're turning Shorty into Manny.

11:06.784 --> 11:08.325
Stop hogging my best friend!

11:08.454 --> 11:11.030
Okay, if you're so upset,
then <i> you</i> can take him.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.073
But stop saying "best friend."

11:13.140 --> 11:14.663
You're too old to be using that word.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.732
Hannah from Montana has a best friend.

11:16.799 --> 11:19.510
- You don't.
- At least my best friend isn't my son.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.806
I'm your best friend, Mom?

11:23.010 --> 11:24.263
Yes, Papi.

11:24.330 --> 11:27.103
You are the son that
he's talking about.

11:28.927 --> 11:31.232
Look, if he said Lily's
lucky to be here,

11:31.299 --> 11:33.317
then he's clearly unhappy
at Pepper and Ronaldo's.

11:33.384 --> 11:35.033
I mean,
w-what kid wouldn't be?

11:35.100 --> 11:37.128
I mean, that house is so sterile.

11:37.299 --> 11:39.110
Do you remember when
Pepper got made at me

11:39.177 --> 11:40.227
and he laid down plastic

11:40.294 --> 11:41.728
before throwing a drink in my face?

11:41.795 --> 11:43.224
So then,
we have to say something.

11:43.291 --> 11:44.372
I mean, we're their friends.

11:44.429 --> 11:45.568
We're experienced parents.

11:45.635 --> 11:47.569
There's... There's still
time for them to change.

11:47.636 --> 11:48.716
No, it's not our place.

11:48.783 --> 11:50.311
Let's just, you know, stay out of it.

11:50.378 --> 11:52.380
They keep their door unlocked?

11:52.447 --> 11:54.751
That's the upside of not having
anything worth stealing.

11:54.818 --> 11:56.486
You're terrible parents.

11:56.543 --> 11:58.229
Okay, so, I guess we
<i>are</i> saying something.

11:58.296 --> 11:59.430
All right.

11:59.497 --> 12:00.834
Time for some tough love, boys.

12:00.901 --> 12:02.427
Oh, goodness, we feared you two

12:02.494 --> 12:03.989
might be into that sort of thing,

12:04.056 --> 12:05.088
but we're gonna have to pass.

12:05.145 --> 12:07.072
Oh, you can't possibly think
that's what he meant.

12:07.129 --> 12:08.494
No, I'm deflecting!

12:08.571 --> 12:11.107
I feel the sickening
threat of brutal honesty,

12:11.174 --> 12:13.036
- And I'm wildly uncomfortable.
- And I'm wildly uncomfortable.

12:13.093 --> 12:14.492
Okay, well, here goes.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.500
We think it's great
that you adopted Lionel, but...

12:18.062 --> 12:19.742
Okay, a little early for that reaction.

12:19.799 --> 12:20.863
- I haven't even gotten to say,
- I haven't even gotten to say,

12:20.920 --> 12:22.955
"Stop imposing your fancy ways
on that poor child."

12:23.022 --> 12:24.445
And hit it.

12:24.512 --> 12:26.525
Look, we have been at this
parenting thing

12:26.592 --> 12:27.616
For a while now, and...

12:27.683 --> 12:30.406
Yeah, and Lily is such a delight!

12:31.025 --> 12:33.236
Sorry,
I'm gonna be lashing out for a bit.

12:33.536 --> 12:35.884
Anyway, um, part of parenting

12:35.951 --> 12:38.166
is exposing your children
to things that you value.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.439
You know,
art and culture and good food...

12:40.514 --> 12:42.046
That's exactly what we're doing.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.585
But it's also about letting them
figure out who <i> they</i> are,

12:45.667 --> 12:47.554
doing things that they want to do

12:47.621 --> 12:48.859
even though you don't like 'em.

12:48.916 --> 12:50.114
- Yeah, he's a kid.
- Yeah, he's a kid.

12:50.171 --> 12:53.205
He doesn't want opera at bedtime
and caviar on his eggs.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.857
He... He wants to play
ball and eat Cheetos.

12:55.924 --> 12:59.005
Well, I did see him spit
some sashimi into a napkin,

12:59.072 --> 13:01.118
But I hoped he was just worried about his weight.

13:01.185 --> 13:02.465
You know what,
let's get outside.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.961
Let's go do something fun
and show Lionel

13:05.028 --> 13:08.049
That it... that it's okay
to be a kid with you guys.

13:08.275 --> 13:09.567
What do you say? - Yeah.

13:09.634 --> 13:11.120
- Get in there.
- It's fine.

13:11.187 --> 13:12.502
Okay.

13:18.628 --> 13:20.857
And from what fromagerie...

13:20.924 --> 13:24.543
- You're from Lubbock, Texas.
- You son of a bitch!

13:26.969 --> 13:29.078
Oh, I can't believe
no one told me

13:29.145 --> 13:30.945
Kickball is performed on grass

13:31.012 --> 13:33.211
I can barely stand
Shakespeare in a park.

13:33.330 --> 13:35.141
This is not great for your people.

13:35.208 --> 13:37.057
Okay, Lionel, bring me home.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.207
You got this.

13:38.274 --> 13:40.013
Yes, I do, sir. -

13:40.080 --> 13:41.582
All right.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.568
Yeah!

13:43.635 --> 13:45.727
- Oh, my God, what is happening?
- Hit him!

13:45.794 --> 13:47.110
- Pepper, hit him!
- Oh!

13:47.177 --> 13:48.215
Hit Cam!

13:48.282 --> 13:49.313
Oh, my...!

13:49.461 --> 13:51.383
You can't possibly think
that's what he meant.

13:51.450 --> 13:52.598
Oh! Give me that.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.926
Okay.

13:54.203 --> 13:55.569
I was skeptical at first

13:55.636 --> 13:58.263
because orange is so over
right now,

13:58.416 --> 13:59.602
But I love it.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.146
You like it, too, Pepper?

14:01.213 --> 14:02.662
Mm, wonderful.

14:02.736 --> 14:04.497
I haven't seen this much
artificial color

14:04.564 --> 14:06.565
since Ted Turner
got his hands on "Casablanca."

14:06.632 --> 14:08.332
Your grandparents grew up
in a trailer.

14:08.399 --> 14:09.987
I hate you.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.271
- All right, who's up next?
- All right, who's up next?

14:11.328 --> 14:12.568
- Pepper!
- Pepper!

14:12.626 --> 14:14.714
Oh. How many scenes
does kickball have?

14:14.772 --> 14:16.381
You can do it, Peppercito!

14:16.439 --> 14:18.005
Remember, it's just like dancing.

14:18.176 --> 14:19.478
Dancing.

14:20.031 --> 14:22.720
And five, six, seven, eight, kick!

14:22.787 --> 14:24.596
Oh! Pepper!

14:24.677 --> 14:26.573
Ohh! Oh, I'm hurt!

14:26.638 --> 14:27.935
I'm really hurt!

14:28.026 --> 14:30.526
Oh, if you two had any
money, I'd sue you.

14:30.612 --> 14:31.736
<i>Mi amor,</i> it's okay.

14:31.794 --> 14:33.862
It's <i> not</i> okay.

14:33.932 --> 14:37.428
I'm out in the wild,
schvitzing like a line cook.

14:37.541 --> 14:40.124
It's one humiliation after the next!

14:40.233 --> 14:43.440
Lionel, sweetheart, I want
to be the father you need,

14:43.498 --> 14:45.322
but this is not me.

14:45.513 --> 14:50.566
I hate sports and nature
and... and sherbet...

14:50.624 --> 14:52.555
God, do I hate sherbet!

14:52.680 --> 14:57.015
There's ice cream and sorbet
and nothing in between.

14:57.215 --> 14:59.784
Just so you know, I don't
care about kickball

14:59.888 --> 15:01.946
or Popsicles or any of that stuff.

15:02.204 --> 15:03.346
I like how we live.

15:03.427 --> 15:04.441
You do?

15:04.499 --> 15:06.963
Lionel, don't feel pressured to
say that if you don't mean it.

15:07.021 --> 15:08.061
I mean it.

15:08.119 --> 15:10.442
Backgammon in the study,
cheese from France,

15:10.500 --> 15:12.378
not a cheetah in sunglasses.

15:12.569 --> 15:14.369
Lionel, you're melting my heart.

15:14.427 --> 15:16.544
Mine, too, you perfect boy.

15:16.602 --> 15:18.802
What made you think I
didn't like our life?

15:19.986 --> 15:21.511
Well, now, see...

15:21.577 --> 15:23.914
They were forcing you to,
and it just seemed to us...

15:23.972 --> 15:25.282
It seemed to us...

15:25.535 --> 15:27.977
You told Lily that she was
lucky to live with us.

15:28.035 --> 15:30.049
- Remember?
- I was trying to make her feel better.

15:30.107 --> 15:31.891
I got so much, and she got...

15:32.430 --> 15:34.020
They give her haircuts at home.

15:34.078 --> 15:35.800
Okay, I took a class.

15:35.858 --> 15:38.175
They wouldn't even let her
take horseback-riding lessons.

15:38.253 --> 15:39.931
- Because it's dangerous.
- Because it's dangerous.

15:39.988 --> 15:41.644
Or is it because
you have to drive me

15:41.702 --> 15:43.440
across town at 7:00 A.M.?

15:43.621 --> 15:45.170
I thought good parents

15:45.237 --> 15:47.683
were supposed to do things
their <i> kids</i> want to do?

15:47.750 --> 15:49.507
Okay, well, it's not <i> not</i> dangerous,

15:49.574 --> 15:51.091
and she's also too young, so...

15:51.149 --> 15:52.458
Cam, come on.
The jig's up.

15:52.516 --> 15:55.692
Yes, Lily, we were...
we were being selfish, okay?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.426
You can have your lessons.

15:57.484 --> 15:58.587
Thank you.

15:58.645 --> 16:00.750
Can I take horseback-riding
lessons with her, too?

16:00.817 --> 16:02.180
Anything you want.

16:02.247 --> 16:04.357
You can swing by and
pick him up on your way.

16:06.551 --> 16:07.872
Hey, there.

16:08.131 --> 16:10.054
Hi, honey. How are you?

16:10.176 --> 16:11.724
Mwah! Good.

16:12.057 --> 16:15.067
Well, you seem less scary.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.924
Does this mean we're gonna
have a nice, pleasant dinner

16:16.981 --> 16:18.630
with our daughter and her boyfriend?

16:18.688 --> 16:20.075
He give me a little credit.

16:20.159 --> 16:22.064
I worked so hard all day

16:22.122 --> 16:25.587
just to make sure I
got everything ready.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.255
Oh, come on!

16:28.510 --> 16:30.372
You have got to be kidding me.

16:30.481 --> 16:33.388
Well, it turns out Speedy Frame
really lives up to its name.

16:33.455 --> 16:34.567
We're here!

16:34.661 --> 16:36.961
- Claire, I got you a bottle of pi...
- No!

16:37.075 --> 16:39.114
Oh, good, you got our gift.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.197
You gave it to them?

16:40.255 --> 16:42.256
Don't freak out, babe.
That's exactly what she wants.

16:42.313 --> 16:44.921
Wow, Mom,
I really love it there.

16:44.988 --> 16:46.546
Me, too.

16:46.660 --> 16:49.066
Sex painting on the wall
means Alex was in her head.

16:49.141 --> 16:51.418
And I wasn't planning on
leaving anytime soon.

16:51.754 --> 16:53.464
I don't know where that came from.

16:53.522 --> 16:54.735
More green beans?

16:54.793 --> 16:56.718
Oh, yes. Don't mind if I do.

16:56.937 --> 16:59.638
I have to admit,
I feel slightly uncomfortable.

16:59.699 --> 17:01.067
Well, it's getting late.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.244
It's 7:30.

17:02.311 --> 17:04.653
So, Dad, how's work?

17:04.720 --> 17:06.458
No. We're not gonna
sit here and pretend.

17:06.516 --> 17:09.349
We're going to talk about this.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.348
Your father's right.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.426
When I saw that painting, I thought...

17:14.645 --> 17:16.344
you're too restrained.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.887
- You two need to loosen up a little.
- That's not what I meant.

17:18.944 --> 17:20.010
Oh, no, no, no.

17:20.077 --> 17:23.555
I appreciate the advice,
and that should be an easy fix

17:23.622 --> 17:26.453
now that I've come into my own
with such a virile partner.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.086
Oh, my God.

17:28.153 --> 17:29.569
Okay, that is enough!

17:29.636 --> 17:31.235
Look what you're doing
to this poor man,

17:31.302 --> 17:33.687
putting him in the middle of
this twisted power struggle

17:33.754 --> 17:35.012
between the two of you!

17:35.079 --> 17:37.957
This is exactly what you and
your dad always did to me.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.399
What are you talking about?

17:39.466 --> 17:41.057
The first time I met your dad,

17:41.124 --> 17:43.388
who did not approve me,
you kept kissing me.

17:43.451 --> 17:45.175
Or the first time we went
away with your family

17:45.232 --> 17:46.982
to that cabin and you
made all those noises.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.358
Th-That wasn't about that.

17:48.416 --> 17:50.500
Then where did those
noises go, Claire?

17:50.759 --> 17:53.106
I will not stand here while
you tear poor Ben down

17:53.173 --> 17:54.363
the way that Jay tore me down,

17:54.407 --> 17:55.335
and, Ben, were you blue or gold?

17:55.385 --> 17:57.430
- I need to know.
- I was blue.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.525
I wanted to feel like an Avatar.

18:00.791 --> 18:02.123
Ben, I'm sorry.

18:02.190 --> 18:03.655
Phil and Alex are right.

18:03.722 --> 18:05.851
You don't deserve to
be treated this way.

18:05.945 --> 18:07.945
- Thank you, Claire. You know, I...
- Not finished.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.283
- I am doing to you...
- Oh.

18:09.372 --> 18:12.052
Exactly what my father
did to me and Phil.

18:12.179 --> 18:14.853
No one was good enough for
his little girl, and...

18:15.455 --> 18:18.080
And I suppose nobody's
good enough for mine.

18:18.867 --> 18:21.809
But, honey, I've been
where you are right now,

18:21.876 --> 18:23.808
and I'm the <i> last</i> person

18:23.875 --> 18:25.908
who should be making
it harder for you.

18:26.078 --> 18:27.915
I'm... I'm so sorry.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.579
And I'm sorry I left the sex
painting for you to find.

18:30.654 --> 18:32.055
If it makes you feel any better,

18:32.156 --> 18:33.225
we faked it.

18:33.292 --> 18:35.415
Ben was so freaked out,
he couldn't perform.

18:35.543 --> 18:37.610
Doesn't make <i> me</i> feel any better.

18:37.677 --> 18:38.963
That helps a lot.

18:39.818 --> 18:46.099
♪ I do believe I have
been changed for the better ♪

18:46.166 --> 18:48.723
I still don't understand

19:13.898 --> 19:15.556

19:15.623 --> 19:17.156
I-I dozed off for a couple of minutes.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.881
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:18.948 --> 19:20.754
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

19:20.821 --> 19:21.911
Damn it.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.994
I should've sent Gloria.

19:28.447 --> 19:30.031
Hey, fella.

19:30.098 --> 19:32.434
What happened in there?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.816
I'm a fraud, Jay.

19:34.997 --> 19:36.273
I'm a damn fraud.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.815
Come on. We all cry at weird stuff.

19:38.882 --> 19:41.003
For me, it's when boxers
hug after a fight.

19:41.070 --> 19:42.853
It's not the crying I'm worried about.

19:42.911 --> 19:43.918
You were right.

19:43.985 --> 19:46.612
You said I would lose everything
if I went to Costa Rica,

19:46.670 --> 19:48.412
- and I did.
- What are you talking about?

19:48.470 --> 19:49.891
I-I-I thought you were
a big juice magnate.

19:49.948 --> 19:52.263
Lies! It's all lies, Jay!

19:52.330 --> 19:53.871
I'm not no juice magnate.

19:53.938 --> 19:56.138
I had a juice stand, and
things were okay...

19:56.469 --> 19:58.865
until these monkeys got
a hold of my knives.

19:59.277 --> 20:01.912
The lawyer says I can't talk about it.

20:01.979 --> 20:05.564
Then Darlene takes off with
this honcho in zip lines

20:05.635 --> 20:06.741
and leaves me.

20:06.808 --> 20:08.654
That's why I've been avoiding you.

20:08.721 --> 20:10.237
I'm a disgusting loser!

20:10.304 --> 20:11.561
Who are you talking to?

20:11.628 --> 20:13.124
You don't need to be embarrassed.

20:13.191 --> 20:15.372
But you said, "Don't
come crying to me"

20:15.439 --> 20:16.677
when it all turns to hell

20:16.735 --> 20:18.149
"and I have to pick up the pieces."

20:18.216 --> 20:20.199
- You said that!
- It's just what you say.

20:20.266 --> 20:22.009
Of course I'm gonna
pick up the pieces.

20:22.076 --> 20:23.234
What else would I do?

20:23.301 --> 20:24.510
You're my best friend.

20:24.567 --> 20:27.668
And you're my best friend, damn it.
Come on.

20:28.453 --> 20:31.563
I'm better because I knew <i> you.</i>

20:31.630 --> 20:33.995
Best friends forever.

20:34.873 --> 20:38.039
Yeah, Gloria's right.
I... I hear it now.

20:41.398 --> 20:43.771
Manny, open the door.
I know you're in there.

20:43.838 --> 20:45.652
Mom, what are you doing here?

20:45.719 --> 20:47.968
I know that you said that
you wanted your space,

20:48.026 --> 20:50.590
but... it's so hard on me, okay?

20:50.661 --> 20:52.886
So I want a text message

20:52.953 --> 20:55.825
at the end of every day
telling me that you're okay,

20:55.892 --> 20:58.461
and three times a week,
a picture of your face

20:58.519 --> 20:59.765
so that I can look into your eyes

20:59.822 --> 21:01.066
and see if you're lying to me.

21:01.124 --> 21:02.748
Mother, we texted yesterday morning.

21:02.857 --> 21:04.511
No, we didn't. That was days ago.

21:04.569 --> 21:06.617
Yesterday, at 8:37 A.M.,

21:06.675 --> 21:08.668
you asked if I got your
care package and said,

21:08.726 --> 21:10.441
"Don't tell Jay
I gave you a sausage,"

21:10.592 --> 21:12.160
then you accidentally hit voice memo

21:12.218 --> 21:14.460
and I heard you tell Stella
to go in the yard and die.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.551
I'm sorry.

21:17.096 --> 21:19.058
I just miss you.

21:24.441 --> 21:25.995
I guess it's not so terrible

21:26.062 --> 21:27.972
if you stop on by every now and then.
