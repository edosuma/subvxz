02:03.457 --> 02:05.927
Got a letter from your crazy aunt's lawyer.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.306
Said she needs a live-in.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.278
How much you make this week?

02:14.700 --> 02:16.582
She's got money.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.752
And we're the only family she's got.

02:29.415 --> 02:32.465
Says right here, I'm in charge.

02:35.487 --> 02:37.303
What are you saying?

02:37.823 --> 02:39.638
Be nice.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.843
Be loving. Take care of her.
That's what I'm saying.

02:45.898 --> 02:47.780
You think you could do that?

02:49.501 --> 02:51.739
Heck, I'd even name the baby after her.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.673
Dory.

02:54.373 --> 02:56.844
Kind of catchy, don't you think?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.592
Food ain't free, you know.

03:21.016 --> 03:25.472
<i>I feel numb.
Like everyone sort of half likes me.</i>

03:25.572 --> 03:27.153
<i>Or half hates me.</i>

03:28.541 --> 03:31.979
<i>There are days I'd pay the devil himself
to get me out of here.</i>

03:32.479 --> 03:34.361
<i>Today was one of those days.</i>

03:43.673 --> 03:45.154
Adele.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.240
Aunt Dora?

05:48.481 --> 05:50.329
Aunt Dora?

06:09.503 --> 06:11.389
Aunt Dora?

06:12.604 --> 06:14.612
It's me, Adele.

08:49.728 --> 08:51.610
It's nice to be here.

08:53.215 --> 08:57.450
I found an old picture of you.
You were so pretty.

08:59.004 --> 09:02.421
- Maybe later we can...
- Just leave it there.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.574
Excuse me. Do you have any of these?

09:22.161 --> 09:23.970
They'd be right there.

09:24.070 --> 09:26.875
She said exclusively imported.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.797
She's bought them here before.

09:29.897 --> 09:31.784
I'll go check.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.427
Here.

09:47.386 --> 09:48.968
Pomegranates...

10:00.600 --> 10:01.814
Adele.

11:02.661 --> 11:06.437
I don't know, Mom. I haven't seen her.
She's always in her room.

11:06.537 --> 11:10.804
<i>Ask her if you can get an advance.
These baby vitamins, so damn expensive.</i>

11:10.904 --> 11:12.939
Okay. I gotta go. She's calling.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.620
<i>Okay.</i>

11:30.021 --> 11:31.837
Can I get you something?

11:38.430 --> 11:42.113
It's been so long,
I almost forgot about the doll.

11:43.935 --> 11:46.232
Hope you don't mind but...

11:46.332 --> 11:48.186
...I put it away.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.733
It always gave me the creeps, you know.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.361
Anyway, Mom said to say hi.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.865
Let me know if you need anything.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.446
Adele.

15:39.154 --> 15:40.446
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:40.546 --> 15:42.359
Can I get a slice and an orange soda?

15:42.459 --> 15:43.493
- Plain cheese?
- Yeah.

15:43.593 --> 15:45.824
- Two-fifty.
- Okay.

15:51.306 --> 15:54.771
- Actually, just an orange soda.
- Sure.

15:58.023 --> 16:00.626
Here. Let me get it.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.508
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.399
- I can pay you back.
- Don't worry about it.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.015
Okay.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.684
Thank you.

16:13.972 --> 16:16.977
I'm sitting over there,
if you want to join me.

16:17.554 --> 16:19.057
Sure.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.827
- I'll have a soda.
- Sure.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.539
I saw you staring at me the other day.

16:49.808 --> 16:53.422
- Where do you live?
- In the tower on Main.

16:53.522 --> 16:56.582
- How about you?
- Staying at my aunt's.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.718
- Here in town?
- Over on Wyndham.

17:00.018 --> 17:02.267
The street with all the Victorians.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.637
Some strange cats those Victorians.

17:09.761 --> 17:11.762
You know what they used do for fun?

17:12.765 --> 17:16.672
They'd dress up in weird costumes,
pose for each other.

17:16.771 --> 17:18.588
<i>Tableau vivants.</i>

17:19.137 --> 17:23.175
Can you imagine? Your great grandmother,
dressed up like a nymph.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.891
Dancing around while everyone cheered.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.419
Had some crazy times.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.926
You're late.

18:14.859 --> 18:18.477
- Sorry, I...
- Just go to bed.

18:46.558 --> 18:49.829
<i>I made a new friend today. Beth.</i>

18:50.479 --> 18:55.301
<i>She's not like the girls back home.
She doesn't care what anyone else thinks.</i>

18:55.668 --> 18:59.305
<i>She just says things.
Whatever is on her mind.</i>

18:59.405 --> 19:01.347
<i>I wish I was more like that.</i>

20:18.483 --> 20:21.166
- Adele. Hey.
- Hey.

20:22.787 --> 20:26.124
Sardines? Lucky cat.

20:26.224 --> 20:27.542
Yeah.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.864
So this is your aunt's house?

20:31.964 --> 20:36.235
- I'd invite you in but...
- Come on. I'm just about dying of thirst.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.584
You'd be cruel not to offer me
a glass of water.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.596
Thanks.

20:52.617 --> 20:54.520
I just bought some pomegranates.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.856
They're from Mexico, do you want one?

20:57.056 --> 20:59.729
Just water's fine. Thanks.

21:04.295 --> 21:06.132
You can't go up there.

21:06.632 --> 21:07.855
Why not?

21:07.955 --> 21:10.399
She doesn't like having people in the house.

21:16.074 --> 21:19.479
- What's through here?
- It's just the basement.

21:58.767 --> 22:00.615
Far out.

22:01.185 --> 22:03.455
Here. Try it on.

22:04.889 --> 22:06.771
Come on.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.792
What do you think?

23:49.994 --> 23:54.366
- She's agoraphobic.
- So she won't go outside?

23:54.466 --> 23:56.514
Won't even leave her room.

23:58.636 --> 24:00.473
What's the point?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.608
Sometimes I wonder.

24:03.308 --> 24:05.167
Wonder what?

24:09.815 --> 24:11.696
Can you unzip me?

24:35.573 --> 24:37.455
I'll be quiet.

25:29.961 --> 25:32.994
Adele, I'm jealous.

25:34.215 --> 25:36.898
Your life is so Jane Eyre-ish.

25:37.502 --> 25:39.785
Complete with a mad woman in the attic.

25:41.539 --> 25:45.203
But I have to tell you,
the house smells really bad.

25:46.677 --> 25:48.948
The whole place should be fumigated...

25:49.348 --> 25:51.196
...with her inside.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.086
I'm glad you came.

26:17.475 --> 26:19.276
Do you like my blouse?

26:20.395 --> 26:22.448
You have such nice things.

26:43.201 --> 26:45.082
Looks nice on you.

26:47.171 --> 26:48.987
How much is it?

27:42.827 --> 27:44.676
Aunt Dora?

27:46.298 --> 27:49.368
I was wondering,
do you think I might be able...

27:49.468 --> 27:51.349
...to get a little advance?

27:52.371 --> 27:54.785
I know I just started but...

27:55.840 --> 27:57.689
Not now!

28:44.053 --> 28:47.291
- Hello?
- <i>Adele, it's Beth.</i>

28:47.391 --> 28:51.363
<i>You doing anything later?
I was thinking maybe we could grab a drink.</i>

28:51.463 --> 28:53.678
Sure, that sounds great.

29:03.374 --> 29:05.259
I'll have a Manhattan.

29:08.562 --> 29:10.077
Beth!

29:12.316 --> 29:14.198
You look cute.

29:14.885 --> 29:16.967
Hope you're not sick of me.

29:18.980 --> 29:20.821
Thank you.

29:22.361 --> 29:25.100
That man... he's evil.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.696
<i>Checks going every month...</i>

29:27.796 --> 29:31.094
You do the wrong thing
for the right reason and...

29:32.270 --> 29:33.818
Cheers.

29:39.994 --> 29:42.131
You got any fun plans for the weekend?

29:42.231 --> 29:44.116
Just the usual.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.652
Tea and sardines with Aunt Dora.

29:47.152 --> 29:48.732
Adele.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.224
How about you?

29:52.324 --> 29:54.727
My friend has this cottage, up by the lake.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.942
I've been doing these grave rubbings.

30:00.130 --> 30:02.001
Last time I went...

30:02.301 --> 30:04.515
...I found two small graves.

30:05.636 --> 30:07.673
They had shifted in the ground.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.624
And one of them...

30:10.332 --> 30:12.053
...it had this crack.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.798
I was thinking about lifting it up.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.851
Just to get a glimpse of what's down there.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.971
You should come. It'd be fun.

30:22.221 --> 30:25.671
- What do you think?
- I'm not supposed to leave her alone.

30:25.771 --> 30:28.656
It'll just be for a day. She'll be fine.

30:29.561 --> 30:33.344
You need to start putting yourself
first for a change.

30:34.699 --> 30:36.514
Come on, Adele.

30:36.967 --> 30:40.418
Don't be a sitter, be a doer.

30:51.316 --> 30:53.152
<i>I'm so confused.</i>

30:53.952 --> 30:56.425
<i>Beth whispered in my ear that she loved me.</i>

30:57.955 --> 30:59.805
<i>At least I think she did.</i>

31:02.326 --> 31:04.175
<i>Maybe I'm crazy.</i>

31:10.468 --> 31:12.237
Twenty-nine dollars.

31:12.337 --> 31:14.218
Twenty-nine dollars?

31:15.973 --> 31:17.843
That's awfully expensive.

31:18.643 --> 31:22.660
- What's it for?
- Heart medicine. It's an anti-coagulant.

31:23.314 --> 31:24.483
Miss?

31:24.583 --> 31:27.186
Here. Just get her this.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.820
It's all natural.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.402
Can't trust these pharmaceuticals,
they only care about money.

31:36.260 --> 31:37.849
Come on.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.151
Look at this.

31:59.951 --> 32:04.188
Oh, my gosh. That's repulsive.

32:04.288 --> 32:06.758
Why would anybody want this?

32:06.858 --> 32:08.740
I don't know.

32:13.664 --> 32:16.882
Shit. I think she's awake.

32:31.509 --> 32:33.366
Aunt Dora?

32:34.405 --> 32:36.284
Are you okay?

32:54.638 --> 32:56.909
You sure she didn't fall or something?

32:58.009 --> 32:59.890
Maybe hurt herself.

33:25.135 --> 33:26.951
Get her out of here!

33:43.954 --> 33:46.426
I'm really sorry about last night.

33:49.477 --> 33:51.949
I promise that it won't happen again.

33:59.253 --> 34:02.357
About an advance? Do you think...

34:02.457 --> 34:04.694
You're just like your mother.

34:05.444 --> 34:09.659
You'll get paid next week, as we agreed.

35:34.414 --> 35:38.099
I finished all my chores.
I'm heading out soon.

35:41.822 --> 35:44.105
I'm just trying to help, you know.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.609
Wait.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.179
I didn't mean what I said.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.866
You're not like her.

36:05.445 --> 36:07.704
She's pregnant, you know.

36:08.616 --> 36:10.863
I don't know if you knew that or not.

36:12.519 --> 36:16.022
She said if it's a girl
she's gonna name her Dory...

36:16.724 --> 36:18.595
...after you.

38:12.105 --> 38:13.921
Aunt Dora?

38:17.277 --> 38:19.492
Aunt Dora, this isn't funny.

38:22.983 --> 38:25.232
Aunt Dora, open the door!

38:29.923 --> 38:32.373
Aunt Dora, this isn't funny!

39:54.508 --> 39:56.323
It's beautiful.

40:34.548 --> 40:36.349
Can I tell you something?

40:40.988 --> 40:42.801
I had an abortion.

40:53.100 --> 40:54.917
I was with a friend.

40:56.804 --> 40:58.653
<i>Not too far from here.</i>

41:01.600 --> 41:03.857
<i>We took some quaaludes and...</i>

41:05.312 --> 41:07.177
<i>...there was this guy.</i>

41:09.549 --> 41:11.632
Just laying there on the shore.

41:14.554 --> 41:16.163
He kept looking at us.

41:19.026 --> 41:21.123
So I took my shirt off.

41:25.565 --> 41:29.183
<i>And he just... he just laid there.</i>

41:30.937 --> 41:33.584
<i>So I ran up nice and close and...</i>

41:35.675 --> 41:38.147
<i>...kicked some sand in his face.</i>

41:38.647 --> 41:40.682
And when he turned over...

41:41.512 --> 41:43.364
...you could see he was hard.

41:45.685 --> 41:47.901
I whispered in my friend's ear...

41:48.722 --> 41:50.638
<i>...you go first.</i>

41:56.630 --> 41:58.712
I just stood there...

41:59.833 --> 42:01.849
...listening to her moan.

42:03.003 --> 42:04.818
Then it was my turn.

42:08.976 --> 42:10.833
And he just...

42:11.818 --> 42:13.677
...laid there.

42:16.383 --> 42:18.299
His face all red...

42:19.553 --> 42:21.668
...still covered in sand.

42:26.994 --> 42:29.209
Till he came inside me.

42:34.217 --> 42:36.103
Men are pigs.

42:37.270 --> 42:40.121
Yeah. For sure.

42:42.409 --> 42:45.859
You know, it's pretty easy
to put a collar on a pig.

43:35.562 --> 43:37.377
This is Buzzle.

43:37.914 --> 43:40.417
My dad gave him to me just before he died.

43:41.869 --> 43:45.952
- How did he die?
- Car accident. I was only seven.

43:46.706 --> 43:48.522
That sucks.

43:50.277 --> 43:52.280
So your aunt, she's...

43:52.380 --> 43:54.416
My mom's older sister.

43:54.816 --> 43:58.832
Step sister. A lot older, actually.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.175
When I was little...

44:02.275 --> 44:06.344
...my mom would drop me off with her
sometimes. For the weekend.

44:07.728 --> 44:11.408
Mama pajama. That's what I would call her.

44:12.466 --> 44:17.222
We would just... drink tea
and eat cookies in our PJ's.

44:18.209 --> 44:22.023
And she would tell me strange stories
about my grandparents.

44:22.376 --> 44:24.191
For fun.

44:25.178 --> 44:26.982
So she was normal.

44:27.782 --> 44:29.618
She was never normal.

44:29.718 --> 44:33.266
She was never like this. This bad.

44:34.654 --> 44:38.738
We would go out.
Like, to the park and fly kites.

44:39.759 --> 44:43.177
But never anywhere where there was
a crowd or anything like that.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.308
How'd she get so bad?

44:49.502 --> 44:51.343
Who knows.

44:52.656 --> 44:55.739
I haven't seen her, in like, forever.

44:57.377 --> 45:01.595
She's got money, and my mom
thinks she's gonna get all of it.

45:05.252 --> 45:08.523
And you're just here,
keeping an eye on things?

45:08.623 --> 45:11.756
- Something like that.
- Who knows...

45:12.696 --> 45:14.774
...maybe she'll leave you everything.

45:16.095 --> 45:18.867
The house. You know, the monkey.

45:18.967 --> 45:20.782
Yeah, right.

45:21.293 --> 45:25.306
I don't think so.
She doesn't like me very much.

45:25.406 --> 45:27.275
Not anymore.

45:28.675 --> 45:31.525
Can you imagine though? My mom would freak.

47:08.775 --> 47:10.645
I had fun today.

47:11.045 --> 47:12.893
Thank you.

47:42.809 --> 47:44.892
I love you, Adele.

47:49.082 --> 47:50.885
What's wrong?

47:51.085 --> 47:53.694
Nothing. I'm just...

47:54.144 --> 47:55.968
I'm not really...

47:59.793 --> 48:01.341
Okay.

48:02.429 --> 48:04.031
Here.

48:04.331 --> 48:07.137
Just lie in bed. Next to me.

48:42.435 --> 48:43.883
Adele.

50:03.183 --> 50:05.019
Who was that?

50:05.119 --> 50:07.154
Just a neighbor.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.068
Mrs. Connolly.

50:09.456 --> 50:11.125
Sweet old lady.

50:11.225 --> 50:13.640
I thought you didn't like old people.

50:17.197 --> 50:20.680
I invited a friend over.
He should be here soon.

51:27.567 --> 51:30.049
Here's fine. Just let me off here.

52:20.620 --> 52:22.502
Aunt Dora?

53:27.253 --> 53:29.134
Aunt Dora?

53:32.291 --> 53:34.708
Aunt Dora, please, I'm worried.

54:39.292 --> 54:40.859
Adele.

56:19.527 --> 56:22.575
<i>You've reached the law offices of Myers...</i>

57:15.681 --> 57:17.497
What are you doing here?

57:24.056 --> 57:25.572
Adele!

57:28.561 --> 57:30.109
Adele!

57:35.167 --> 57:37.010
I thought we were together.

57:38.005 --> 57:41.458
Together? You mean, like...

58:38.180 --> 58:39.928
<i>Strange day.</i>

58:40.716 --> 58:44.207
<i>I should probably feel bad
or something, but I don't.</i>

58:45.138 --> 58:48.609
<i>I miss Beth. I miss the cat.</i>

58:49.309 --> 58:51.157
<i>But I don't miss Aunt Dora.</i>

59:37.990 --> 59:40.606
- Do you buy jewelry?
- Yeah.

59:53.940 --> 59:55.988
I can do ten on that.

59:58.577 --> 01:00:00.848
I can do thirteen on that.

01:00:01.668 --> 01:00:03.400
- That's it?
- Yeah.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.165
- What about these?
- No.

01:00:17.378 --> 01:00:20.454
There you go. Receipt?

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.730
Do you see her?

01:01:20.693 --> 01:01:23.330
My place. It's only a few blocks.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.057
Sure.

01:01:40.012 --> 01:01:43.018
I'll give you a ring soon.

01:04:09.027 --> 01:04:10.529
Jesus!

01:04:11.229 --> 01:04:13.246
Beth! How'd you get in?

01:04:27.012 --> 01:04:29.262
I came to thank you for the ring.

01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:34.134
Such a beautiful ring.

01:04:39.892 --> 01:04:41.758
Are you okay?

01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:44.413
You seem different.

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.901
How'd you get in?

01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:50.449
You shouldn't leave the door unlocked.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.942
Beth?

01:06:12.484 --> 01:06:13.932
Beth?

01:06:39.211 --> 01:06:40.793
Adele.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.854
Adele.

01:07:01.233 --> 01:07:02.748
Adele.

01:07:18.083 --> 01:07:20.501
<i>I'm sitting over there
if you want to join me.</i>

01:07:21.654 --> 01:07:23.165
<i>Sure.</i>

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:47.786
I love you, Adele.

01:07:50.182 --> 01:07:51.714
Adele.

01:08:36.495 --> 01:08:38.076
Adele.

01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:32.631
Adele?

01:09:40.692 --> 01:09:42.241
Adele?

01:10:00.812 --> 01:10:02.394
Adele?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.215
Adele?

01:10:08.054 --> 01:10:09.935
It's me, Dory.

01:10:30.842 --> 01:10:32.391
Adele.
