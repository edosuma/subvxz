Thank you all for taking the time to come today.

I am Shiroe, of the guild Log Horizon.

You can keep the introductions short,

Shiroe of the Tea Party.

Thank you, Isaac.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.310
I'm surprised and honored 
that you remember me.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.240
How could I forget?

03:36.490 --> 03:37.320
Well?

03:37.610 --> 03:40.860
<b>William Massachusetts

Silver Sword</b>

03:37.890 --> 03:40.460
Why are we here, exactly?

03:41.870 --> 03:47.410
I've brought you here for input and aid, 
concerning Akihabara's present state.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.830
As you know, ever since the Apocalypse,

03:51.470 --> 03:53.830
we've been trapped in this world.

03:55.340 --> 03:57.840
And there's no way to know if 
we'll be able to return.

03:58.630 --> 04:01.570
Given the circumstances, I'd like to 
keep the situation in Akihabara

04:01.570 --> 04:03.330
from getting any worse.

04:04.170 --> 04:05.910
That's a lot to ask.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.470
Are you thinking of

04:09.060 --> 04:13.000
something similar to the failed attempt 
to form alliances of the smaller guilds?

04:09.640 --> 04:13.270
<b>Crusty 
Race/ Human

D.D.D</b>

04:13.940 --> 04:14.780
Similar, yes.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.150
However...

04:16.890 --> 04:19.480
I've heard that that plan was halted.

04:19.780 --> 04:23.480
<b>Ichimonjinosuke Akaneya 
Race/ Human 
Sorcerer, Lv. 90 
Radio Market</b>

04:19.870 --> 04:23.490
That plan had many problems.

04:24.430 --> 04:29.580
It was the smaller guilds' attempt to unite, 
to compete with the larger ones.

04:29.790 --> 04:36.460
<b>Woodstock W. 
Race/ Dwarf 
Assassin, Lv. 90 
Grandeur</b>

04:30.300 --> 04:33.800
In other words, they wanted 
to protect their interests.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.180
They were only concerned with themselves.

04:36.650 --> 04:42.910
<b>Eins 
Race/ Human 
Shrine Priest, Lv. 90 
Honesty</b>

04:37.000 --> 04:40.310
Then is your goal today to gather 
the major powers in Akihabara,

04:40.310 --> 04:42.910
to prevent the collision of interests?

04:44.320 --> 04:46.970
That won't happen.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.020
Everyone seems to assume

04:49.020 --> 04:53.090
that this would be a continuation 
of the first failed alliance.

04:53.090 --> 04:56.980
Correcting them quickly would be best.

04:57.650 --> 04:59.320
That is not the intent.

04:59.850 --> 05:03.990
My only goal here is to improve 
the situation in Akihabara.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.910
Then I'll be on my way.

05:07.530 --> 05:09.690
We are a combat guild.

05:10.230 --> 05:12.250
We have no interest in the city itself.

05:12.690 --> 05:16.510
That's merely where we go to sell our items.

05:16.510 --> 05:17.250
In other words,

05:17.710 --> 05:21.250
the city's condition doesn't matter to us.

05:24.450 --> 05:28.430
Let those who care about the 
city solve its problems.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.170
I don't believe there's anything 
wrong with discussion.

05:33.110 --> 05:35.450
But I do think it's a waste of time.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.150
Regardless, we aren't interested.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.150
Do it without us.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.210
Silver Sword's out.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.270
An expected scenario.

05:48.850 --> 05:50.160
Um...

05:50.600 --> 05:54.620
It's such an important day,

05:54.620 --> 05:56.720
but I haven't seen Akatsuki or Naotsugu...

05:56.720 --> 05:59.560
Or even Shouryuu and Hien all day.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.230
Come to think of it...

06:01.230 --> 06:03.420
I'm sure they're busy with something else.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.090
Hey, is it true?

06:07.090 --> 06:08.960
That we can escape from here?

06:08.960 --> 06:11.350
Yeah, I got word this morning.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.660
As soon as Tohya and the rest depart to 
hunt, leave the guild hall with them.

06:17.620 --> 06:19.010
Take all the new players with you.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.600
You need only walk out the door.

06:22.440 --> 06:26.400
A female assassin named Akatsuki 
will be in the Guild Building.

06:27.170 --> 06:30.800
And just in case, a guardian named 
Naotsugu will be in the Cathedral.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.370
I can't be with you, but don't worry.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.000
The entire Guild Building is under my control.

06:41.590 --> 06:44.250
He said we only need to go out the door.

06:44.740 --> 06:46.310
Just run straight.

06:46.310 --> 06:47.570
Got it.

06:48.110 --> 06:51.730
But what does he mean that the 
Guild Building is under his control?

06:51.730 --> 06:54.920
I don't know, but all we have 
to do is run out the door.

06:55.230 --> 06:56.010
You there.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.960
What are you whispering about?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.570
N-Nothing!

06:58.960 --> 07:00.570
Not a thing!

07:02.210 --> 07:03.370
I'll continue.

07:04.350 --> 07:06.250
I've gathered you here

07:06.250 --> 07:09.150
to help create a council to 
discuss Akihabara's problems.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.570
A Round Table conference.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.650
Our immediate goal will be to improve 
the city's atmosphere and safety.

07:19.570 --> 07:20.780
In the long term,

07:20.780 --> 07:24.760
I'd like us to be capable of addressing 
different types of problems.

07:25.980 --> 07:27.960
This is where it gets serious.

07:28.910 --> 07:30.050
Before we get to that,

07:31.010 --> 07:34.740
can you tell us how you chose 
those you invited today?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.080
Certainly.

07:36.530 --> 07:40.480
First, the Black Sword Knights, Honesty,

07:40.980 --> 07:44.370
D.D.D., and the West Wind Brigade

07:44.370 --> 07:49.900
were chosen as the largest or most 
notable of the combat guilds.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.490
Same for Silver Sword, 
which is no longer with us.

07:53.190 --> 07:55.820
Marine Agency, Roderic Merchant Guild,

07:55.820 --> 07:59.520
and Shopping Street 8 were chosen 
to represent the crafting guilds.

08:00.060 --> 08:03.240
The Crescent Moon Alliance, 
Grandeur, and Radio Market

08:03.600 --> 08:05.500
represent not only their own guilds,

08:06.060 --> 08:11.760
but the smaller guilds, as well as 
players who don't belong to one.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.510
Indeed...

08:13.910 --> 08:17.760
Around 6,000 players in the guilds 
are represented here.

08:18.990 --> 08:23.140
Which means 9,000 players in the city either

08:23.140 --> 08:26.520
don't belong to one or are in a smaller one.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.050
And you?

08:28.050 --> 08:31.510
I am here as meeting organizer and the 
one who came up with the proposal.

08:32.190 --> 08:35.510
Log Horizon only has four members.

08:35.510 --> 08:39.540
Normally, they wouldn't have the right 
to participate in this conference.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.000
In other words,

08:41.960 --> 08:44.760
you put this meeting together and invited us,

08:44.760 --> 08:47.920
so that you would have the right to be here.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.800
That's correct.

08:50.090 --> 08:55.180
Even if we form this council you're talking 
about, how will we keep the peace?

08:55.710 --> 09:00.660
No, what do you mean, exactly, 
by the city being unsafe?

09:02.190 --> 09:03.750
You're all aware

09:03.750 --> 09:08.320
that certain guilds are locking up new players 
under the guise of protection, yes?

09:12.890 --> 09:15.360
You're talking about the EXP pots.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.700
Listen up!

09:18.900 --> 09:20.360
It's time to go hunting.

09:20.740 --> 09:23.260
Get ready and meet, up front.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.520
Crafters, be sure to reach your quotas.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.780
Got it?

09:30.350 --> 09:31.710
Shiroe,

09:32.120 --> 09:34.220
we're ready to go.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.340
One cough.

09:37.780 --> 09:38.720
Okay...

09:38.900 --> 09:41.040
Everyone, time to go.

09:42.380 --> 09:46.420
But that isn't illegal.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.060
Currently, in this world,

09:49.430 --> 09:51.190
there are no laws.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.580
Sure, there are.

09:52.580 --> 09:55.390
There are No Combat zones.

09:55.950 --> 09:59.390
That's simply a defensive system attacking players

09:59.390 --> 10:02.240
who fight in No Combat areas.

10:03.590 --> 10:07.570
It isn't a law, but a natural phenomenon, 
like any other.

10:08.230 --> 10:09.200
That's right.

10:09.790 --> 10:13.610
Laws are what people create, 
and others recognize.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.750
That's what Henrietta said.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.760
A few days ago, I went to Susukino.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.510
Susukino?

10:23.430 --> 10:24.720
A guild there was trying

10:25.090 --> 10:30.360
to control the city, and threatening 
NPCs and other players.

10:31.220 --> 10:34.870
By your previous logic, that is not illegal,

10:34.870 --> 10:36.780
since the system doesn't attack them.

10:37.550 --> 10:40.280
But is that really all right?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.610
Is that all that the law is?

10:43.630 --> 10:47.560
Shiroe is trying to explain

10:47.560 --> 10:51.690
that we need laws to bind us, 
in this lawless world.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.750
Everyone seems to be wavering.

10:55.180 --> 10:58.300
Some think rules of some form are necessary.

10:59.070 --> 11:02.350
Some think we'll never be able 
to reach such an agreement.

11:03.120 --> 11:09.010
But what will you do if a group appears that 
refuses to recognize this Round Table?

11:09.540 --> 11:11.860
A group that goes against anything we decide?

11:12.110 --> 11:13.230
We will fight them.

11:13.650 --> 11:14.590
Fight them?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.440
How?

11:16.860 --> 11:18.760
Banish them from Akihabara.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.050
And if necessary, of course, 
we'd force them to disband.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.940
Banish...

11:23.940 --> 11:28.900
But you can't kill anyone in this world.

11:30.630 --> 11:36.210
Either way, you won't be able to do 
it without combat guilds, like us.

11:36.840 --> 11:41.570
If the major guilds here say they 
don't care about the conference,

11:41.570 --> 11:44.720
or about your laws...

11:45.360 --> 11:47.290
It's war.

11:48.050 --> 11:53.230
If the major guilds were to go out of control, 
there'd be no way to stop them...

11:53.460 --> 11:58.230
I must say that this doesn't strike me as realistic.

11:58.890 --> 12:02.110
I believe forming this Round Table is worthwhile.

12:03.020 --> 12:08.810
But it would be mostly for show, without any real—

12:15.930 --> 12:19.410
Today, approximately four hours ago,

12:20.270 --> 12:24.800
I purchased the Guild Building's zone.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.220
<b>Guild Building 
Japan Server 
Akihabara 
City/ No Monsters 
No PVP 
Entry Restrictions/ None 
Exit Restrictions/ None</b>

12:31.230 --> 12:32.770
<b>Owner 
Shiroe 
Guild 
Log Horizon</b>

12:33.570 --> 12:35.190
What did you just say?!

12:36.280 --> 12:37.650
Impressive...

12:38.090 --> 12:41.320
Naturally, I have the authority 
to control the zone's settings.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.570
Including who enters and leaves the zone.

12:46.580 --> 12:50.330
In other words, anyone I put on the blacklist

12:51.130 --> 12:55.250
won't be able to access the Guild Building at all.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.590
See?

12:58.830 --> 13:00.990
He's a real villain.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.260
Meow.

13:08.090 --> 13:13.250
What does his buying the Guild Building mean?

13:13.810 --> 13:19.480
The Guild Building's zone is now 
Shiroe's private property.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.100
Why would that be a problem for people?

13:23.100 --> 13:28.370
Anyone Shiroe doesn't want entering 
the Guild Building, won't be able to.

13:28.740 --> 13:33.870
But the large guilds have their guild halls elsewhere.

13:34.290 --> 13:39.880
To create, join, or leave a guild, 
you have to come to the Guild Building.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.630
And the bank is here, also.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.440
Walking around with lots of money is dangerous,

13:48.440 --> 13:55.020
so most players keep the majority 
of their assets here...

13:55.520 --> 13:57.650
Including valuable belongings.

13:58.300 --> 14:03.980
Since a bank is located in every town, 
you can make a withdrawal anywhere.

14:04.830 --> 14:07.850
But with the Transport Gates off-line,

14:07.850 --> 14:11.110
travel to other cities is almost impossible.

14:11.110 --> 14:12.160
In other words...

14:12.160 --> 14:20.840
Shiroe can prevent any Akihabara adventurer 
from accessing their own bank account.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.670
Then that makes him just like a bad guy!

14:24.980 --> 14:31.220
Shiroe makes the devil himself 
look meek and mild.

14:31.770 --> 14:37.210
The devil knows he's a bad boy, 
but Shiroe doesn't.

14:37.820 --> 14:41.710
The nickname "Villain in Glasses" is too generous.

14:43.230 --> 14:47.200
<i>A zone's owner has the right to control 
who enters and leaves it.</i>

14:47.200 --> 14:50.720
<i>But they can also designate areas 
to allow or prohibit combat.</i>

14:52.550 --> 14:57.120
<i>Given their need to control the new players,</i>

14:57.120 --> 14:59.400
<i>Hamelin's guild hall should allow combat.</i>

15:01.090 --> 15:02.390
Quick, let's go!

15:07.150 --> 15:09.290
I thought something was suspicious.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.390
Where are the other kids?

15:12.210 --> 15:14.000
What are you planning?!

15:15.320 --> 15:17.580
<i>Remember what Shiroe taught you!</i>

15:22.500 --> 15:23.430
Tohya!

15:24.560 --> 15:27.880
<i>The samurai skills Shrike Impalement 
and Lanius Capture...</i>

15:28.310 --> 15:31.990
<i>These temporarily mute an enemy, 
stopping it from casting spells.</i>

15:31.660 --> 15:32.570
Go on ahead!

15:32.570 --> 15:33.430
Right!

15:38.850 --> 15:41.620
<i>Lanius Capture lasts fifteen seconds!</i>

15:43.150 --> 15:44.880
<i>It's about to run out!</i>

15:45.530 --> 15:48.630
<i>The shrine priest's healing ability, 
Damage Interception...</i>

15:49.040 --> 15:53.140
<i>It sets a barrier that absorbs damage 
up to a certain amount.</i>

15:53.410 --> 15:54.890
<i>Right, Shiroe?</i>

15:55.550 --> 15:57.030
You bastards...

15:58.340 --> 16:02.550
I'll send you to the Cathedral a hundred times!

16:02.970 --> 16:04.300
Stop yelling...

16:04.300 --> 16:05.440
What's going on?

16:05.830 --> 16:08.610
The kids ran!

16:13.630 --> 16:14.870
Okay, good.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.140
Come on!

16:17.340 --> 16:19.870
My lord, the escape has begun.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.790
What's he laughing about?

16:24.060 --> 16:26.370
But keeping us from our banks...

16:26.370 --> 16:28.490
That's blackmail.

16:28.490 --> 16:30.530
I simply answered his question.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.460
Anyone who opposes the Round Table

16:33.920 --> 16:36.850
will lose access rights to the Guild Banks.

16:37.110 --> 16:39.060
That's why it's blackmail.

16:39.060 --> 16:44.710
Then, "If we have to, we'll start 
a war," is also blackmail, correct?

16:47.230 --> 16:51.800
Purchasing the Guild Building's zone should 
require an astronomical amount of funds.

16:52.180 --> 16:54.320
Where'd you get the money?

16:54.990 --> 16:56.590
Five million.

16:57.430 --> 16:59.190
We gave him the money.

17:01.060 --> 17:05.040
Then the quest you were leading...

17:05.620 --> 17:07.170
It isn't a quest.

17:07.620 --> 17:09.840
It was to create this council.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.010
Sheesh.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.450
This is it?

17:16.450 --> 17:17.680
Th-This?

17:18.460 --> 17:22.240
Something this simple was 
Crescent Moon's recipe?

17:22.240 --> 17:25.690
You made us pay for this?

17:26.450 --> 17:30.400
Why do you think this isn't worth

17:31.210 --> 17:32.780
five million?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.080
We're almost there, Minori!

17:46.010 --> 17:49.250
This isn't your lucky day, kids.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.240

18:16.830 --> 18:17.760

18:19.930 --> 18:21.120
Let's go, Minori!

18:21.120 --> 18:22.160
Stop!

18:45.730 --> 18:47.320
Tohya, it's not safe here!

18:47.320 --> 18:48.600
R-Right!

No one's following us...

19:05.130 --> 19:06.690
So you're the last two?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.890
I'm Shouryuu.

19:09.350 --> 19:11.250
Shiroe sent me.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.770
He did?

19:13.270 --> 19:15.130
Where is everyone?

19:15.130 --> 19:16.510
Waiting at the entrance.

19:19.180 --> 19:20.030
Huh?

19:20.030 --> 19:21.890
Come on, you can deal with—

19:22.130 --> 19:24.140
Anyway, let's get to the entrance.

19:24.140 --> 19:24.930
Right!

19:24.930 --> 19:26.590
I told you— Huh?

19:26.590 --> 19:28.050
You stupid fox!

19:28.050 --> 19:31.030
That'll cause trouble for Mari— 
I mean, the guild master!

19:30.200 --> 19:31.030
I'm sorry.

19:32.450 --> 19:35.360
Hey, quit stumbling around. You look pathetic.

19:35.990 --> 19:38.660
You're so mean, Tohya.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.430
It hurts, doesn't it?

19:48.430 --> 19:52.080
But this doesn't count as combat.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.840
What did you do to the guild hall?!

19:56.630 --> 19:57.960
What's that look for?!

19:59.100 --> 20:00.140
Tohya!

20:00.140 --> 20:02.100
Don't get cocky, brat.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.810
There's nowhere you can go!

20:04.380 --> 20:08.560
Both of us... We have nowhere to go!

20:13.540 --> 20:15.220
Who are you?

20:15.220 --> 20:19.610
I was sure I'd added every member 
of Hamelin to the blacklist.

20:20.060 --> 20:20.860
Huh?

20:21.400 --> 20:22.840
Oh? My lord?

20:23.500 --> 20:25.370
I'm sorry, I missed one.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.120
His name is...

20:26.180 --> 20:29.660
<b>Schreider/ Adventurer</b>

20:27.800 --> 20:29.660
Schreider?

20:29.850 --> 20:30.980
Just as the name suggests,

20:30.980 --> 20:33.880
his face looks like it's been through a shredder.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.290
Yes.

20:35.290 --> 20:38.200
Wh-What are you babbling about?!

20:39.340 --> 20:41.400
Wh-What just...

20:43.070 --> 20:44.680
Ow! Ow!

20:44.680 --> 20:48.140
So this doesn't count as combat, huh?

20:48.630 --> 20:52.260
I'm really glad to hear that!

20:54.270 --> 20:56.220
M-My luck's run out...

20:56.650 --> 20:59.350
One down, shrimp.

20:59.350 --> 21:00.880
Don't call me "shrimp"!

21:02.320 --> 21:04.010
Tohya and Minori, right?

21:04.540 --> 21:05.940
I'm Akatsuki.

21:05.940 --> 21:08.160
I'm a ninja of my lord, Shiroe.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.300
You and your friends are safe now.

21:11.690 --> 21:15.110
My lord is fighting on another battlefield.

21:17.180 --> 21:20.360
Why don't we start by getting you a bath?

21:22.970 --> 21:26.180
You still have other things 
to say, don't you, Shiroe?

21:26.820 --> 21:28.410
That's true...

21:28.410 --> 21:30.600
No matter what you say,

21:30.600 --> 21:33.460
you're still in a position to blackmail us.

21:34.990 --> 21:36.830
Do you all really think that this town...

21:36.830 --> 21:42.440
No, all this world's adventurers 
are okay as things currently are?

21:43.460 --> 21:45.810
I have two goals.

21:46.670 --> 21:49.720
First, to restore life to everyone in this town.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.590
And in the long term, in this world.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.250
My other is

21:55.990 --> 22:01.020
to create laws that, if nothing else, 
bind the people of this town.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.760
Does anyone here oppose these two goals?

22:08.390 --> 22:11.670
My lord, the escape was a success.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.950
I told you to stop laughing!

22:19.290 --> 22:23.030
If you're that insistent, then I'll 
make a proposal of my own.

22:23.810 --> 22:28.830
Why don't you tell us specifically 
what Log Horizon has in mind?

24:05.440 --> 24:09.200
Shiroe succeeds in rescuing the new 
players, but his battle continues.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.750
His goal is to create a place where he belongs.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.100
But it belongs to more than himself alone.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.910
He has friends and those needing his protection.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.250
A place where they can sit under 
the stars, eating curry.

24:22.560 --> 24:29.990
<b>Grab It in Your Hand</b>

24:22.810 --> 24:24.890
Next time: Grab It in Your Hand.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.800
This is our reality.
