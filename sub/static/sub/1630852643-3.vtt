WEBVTT

00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.020
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:12.865 --> 01:17.411
I love a night hike,
especially when I don't remember starting.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.454
Wait. Am I dreaming?

01:23.458 --> 01:25.878
Evening, giant, talking radish.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.087
Am I dreaming?

01:27.171 --> 01:29.423
Does this answer your question?

01:35.053 --> 01:36.555
Not really.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.600
Wait, wait, wait.
My hair was down when I went to sleep,

01:39.683 --> 01:40.726
and now it's up.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.311
Okay, yep. I'm dreaming.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.314
Hey! Are you ready to hear something neat?

01:45.397 --> 01:48.108
-Yes.
-Like very neat?

01:48.192 --> 01:49.818
Very yes.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.236
Okay. Here goes.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.866
Something big is going to happen.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.494
Something big is gonna happen!

02:00.287 --> 02:02.247
Mokey, something big has happened.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.291
-You woke me up.
-No, no, no.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.792
Of course, that is big,

02:05.876 --> 02:09.545
because I know how much
sleep fuels your energetic spirit.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.299
But no, I'm talking about something else.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.093
Something really, really big.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.637
I feel it.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.556
-Okay, cool. You know what I'm feeling?
-What?

02:19.640 --> 02:20.724
Sleep.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.939
The Fraggle Horn!
Something big is happening.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.024
Let's go!

02:36.823 --> 02:38.867
Hey, buds! How cool is this?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.828
It's the middle of the night,
and we're not in bed!

02:41.912 --> 02:43.830
Something big must be happening.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.749
Wembley. I know.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.835
I've kinda known for a while.

02:47.918 --> 02:50.420
Remember, Wembley,
"big" doesn't mean "good."

02:50.504 --> 02:52.673
That's why you don't tell someone,
"Big morning."

02:55.092 --> 02:58.220
Okay. Attention, all Fraggles.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.139
It's the World's Oldest Fraggle.
Let's get a closer look.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.850
-Yeah.
-Scuse me. Sorry, pardon me.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.351
-Coming through.
-Hi, Ronda.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.103
Coming through.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.271
Comin' through.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.314
I have called you together

03:09.398 --> 03:12.568
because something big is going to happen.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.405
I knew it.

03:16.488 --> 03:21.743
My Fraggles, once in a generation
an amazing event occurs.

03:21.827 --> 03:26.331
Only I have seen it
because I'm so, so, so,

03:26.415 --> 03:29.334
-so, so...
-Old.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.170
I know that.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.422
What is it?

03:35.007 --> 03:38.010
No, I'm serious, Henchy.
What is it? I've forgotten.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.430
It's the Merggle Moon Migration.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.265
That sounds cool.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.058
I knew that!

03:45.142 --> 03:47.227
According to the Fraggle Folio of Facts,

03:47.311 --> 03:50.439
which has been verified
by generations of Fraggles,

03:50.522 --> 03:56.278
tonight the Merggles are going to do
a spectacular Moon Migration Dance.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.366
Henchy, keep the excitement up.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.453
Tell them some of the Merggles
have 12 tails. Yeah!

04:04.536 --> 04:06.163
-But that's not true, sir.
-Yeah.

04:06.622 --> 04:07.623
Facts matter.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.713
Can everyone else hear those?
They're not just inside my own pickle?

04:14.796 --> 04:15.881
I heard it.

04:15.964 --> 04:19.009
-Anyway, tonight's the night.
-Yes.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.804
This rare event happens
once a generation...

04:22.888 --> 04:25.891
-Yeah.
-...during a Blue Moon.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.397
-Where's the moon?
-It was there earlier.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.566
Bit of a letdown?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.362
Hi, blue moon.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.240
You're so beautiful.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.619
Come inside, tushie monster.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.455
Your before-bed gazpacho's getting cold.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.624
Gazpacho.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.752
I love gazpacho. Coming, Ma!

04:53.836 --> 04:56.046
Coming, coming, coming
Get my gazpacho

04:57.130 --> 04:58.465
There it is!

05:00.133 --> 05:01.718
Henchy, make the big announcement.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.804
I bet we're going
to the Cavern of the Merggles

05:03.887 --> 05:05.514
to see the Merggle Moon Migration.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.600
We are all going
to the Cavern of the Merggles

05:08.684 --> 05:11.395
to watch the Merggle Moon Migration.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.729
Yeah!

05:14.731 --> 05:17.734
Mokey! Mokey! Mokey!

05:19.027 --> 05:21.822
Sorry.
Just been a little tapped in lately.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.408
Been knowing a lotta stuff.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.703
-Okay.
-Well, let's get going.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.330
It's a very long way,
and we don't want to miss it.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.415
Yeah.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.085
I, personally, am very keen to see
the great love of my life...

05:35.169 --> 05:37.504
the Queen Merggle.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.925
She's as graceful in the water
as I am on land.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.305
I'm okay.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.308
I'm fine. I'm okay.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.811
Now,
the route to Merggle Cavern is tricky.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.607
Everyone, take a map.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.066
Good idea.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.861
I actually don't need one.

06:00.944 --> 06:04.364
I've really been feeling things
ever since I woke up.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.451
-Well, I'll take one for both of us.
-Good.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.328
Thank you very much. Yeah.

06:09.411 --> 06:10.412
Mokey?

06:10.495 --> 06:12.581
Maps have real information.

06:13.123 --> 06:17.085
Gobo. If you feel
the need to follow your outer map,

06:17.169 --> 06:18.170
I support that.

06:18.253 --> 06:21.340
I'm just in a place
where I need to follow my inner one.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.133
Okay.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.553
-You're my funny little guy.
-Thanks.

06:26.637 --> 06:30.140
Moon Migration! Merggle Queen!

06:30.224 --> 06:31.558
Moon Migration.

06:31.642 --> 06:35.270
All right, friends. Let's hit the road.
I wanna get good seats for this thing.

06:35.354 --> 06:37.898
Not the best seats,
'cause that'd be kinda selfish.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.441
But very, very good seats.

06:39.525 --> 06:43.237
About three rows back, perfectly centered,
but just a tad off to one side.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.782
-Hello! Let's go!
-Yeah, right. Let's go.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.200
-Wait!
-We're late!

06:48.283 --> 06:50.911
-I left my radish necklace in our cave.
-Well?

06:50.994 --> 06:53.830
My radish dream started
this whole big day, and...

06:53.914 --> 06:56.208
I just really want it. I won't be long.

06:56.834 --> 06:57.960
Mokey--

07:03.090 --> 07:04.800
Howling at the moon, Sprocket?

07:06.009 --> 07:11.098
Okay, but when those pigeons stole
my sandwich, you didn't say a thing.

07:11.807 --> 07:14.434
You wanna see what I'm doing?
Then come down here.

07:15.060 --> 07:19.356
And check... it... out.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.194
I know, right?
Tonight, under the full moon,

07:24.278 --> 07:27.990
baby sea turtle hatchlings
are gonna dig their way outta the sand

07:28.073 --> 07:30.576
and run on
their cute little baby flippers.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.328
We're gonna be able
to watch the whole thing live

07:33.412 --> 07:36.331
because of our new drone!

07:37.624 --> 07:38.834
All right. Let's go.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.298
I borrowed this from school.
It's made for night flight.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.935
Hey, look what I found.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.896
A couple of cuties at 12:00.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.649
Hey, that dude's barking at ya.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.152
Okay,
now I'm not sure you realize that's us.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.405
Onward to the beach.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.992
This is so exciting.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.162
You know what?
I was wrong to criticize you.

08:15.704 --> 08:19.124
Howling is the only way
to express how exciting this all is.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.796
-Quiet!
-Sorry, Mrs. Shimmelfinney.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.675
Moon Migration's about to begin!

08:28.759 --> 08:31.470
Flap your foot like a Merggle fin!

08:31.553 --> 08:34.097
Flap, flap, flap, flap!

08:34.681 --> 08:37.476
-Moon Migration's about to begin.
-Hurry! We're losing the others.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.354
Red, breathe. All is fine.

08:40.437 --> 08:44.066
Well, we're late because
you had to change your clothes.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.568
Well, sorry.
I just wanted to dress like my dream.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.613
I needed my radish necklace.
Do you like it, by the way?

08:49.696 --> 08:50.739
I don't like it.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.282
-Know why?
-Why?

08:52.366 --> 08:53.367
Because I love it!

08:56.912 --> 08:58.038
Oh, boy!

08:58.121 --> 09:01.875
I've never been up this late before,
and I'm not even tired.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.919
Anyway, the map says to go this way.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.338
Yeah, but...

09:06.421 --> 09:08.757
something is telling me
that this is the way.

09:08.841 --> 09:09.675
What?

09:10.259 --> 09:14.179
The way you wanna go ends in
a black swirly blob named "Echo Chamber."

09:14.263 --> 09:16.890
Which to me says, "No, no, no, no, no."

09:16.974 --> 09:18.559
I feel you, Boober.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.645
-Mostly because you're on my foot.
-Sorry.

09:22.145 --> 09:25.065
Listen, my intuition
has been talking to me all day,

09:25.148 --> 09:28.360
and my intuition says I should keep
following my intuition. Okay?

09:28.443 --> 09:29.486
I can't. I can't.

09:29.570 --> 09:34.658
We are going the way the map
is telling us to go, AKA the right way!

09:34.741 --> 09:36.910
I will not miss
the Merggle Moon Migration,

09:36.994 --> 09:38.912
a thing I didn't know about
until an hour ago,

09:38.996 --> 09:41.415
but that I will now freak out about
if I don't see!

09:44.418 --> 09:48.005
Okay. Well...
it's like my Uncle Matt always says,

09:48.088 --> 09:49.840
sometimes you gotta go your own way.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.968
I'm not loving you bringing him into this.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.888
Well, we'll see who gets there first,

09:55.971 --> 09:57.848
you old map-heads.

09:59.516 --> 10:03.103
I'm gonna get there so early
the Merggles will still be warming up.

10:03.187 --> 10:04.313
Pretty.

10:04.396 --> 10:08.358
Where are we going
in the middle of the night, Cotterpin?

10:08.442 --> 10:09.943
I'm half asleep.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.030
-Maybe lay on the horn to jolt my juices.
-Okay.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.909
Okay, I'm up.
Now, what are we doing out here?

10:16.992 --> 10:21.288
Well, sir, I found water
where there's never been water before.

10:21.371 --> 10:25.000
So I think that means
there must be radishes out here.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.002
Slam on the brakes, please.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.214
Thanks. It would've been
a lot more dramatic if I was driving.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.216
What do you mean radishes?

10:32.299 --> 10:36.178
Like the radishes we grind down and
turn into Doozer sticks for our buildings?

10:36.261 --> 10:37.930
Well, yeah. Those radishes.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.389
Preposterous.

10:39.473 --> 10:43.519
There have never been radishes out here,
and that's a fact.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.270
Gosh, I love facts.

10:46.230 --> 10:49.316
There's another one.
See how much I love them?

10:49.399 --> 10:52.903
Sir, I'm fairly certain
because of new information

10:52.986 --> 10:55.239
that we will find radishes.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.451
And if I'm wrong,
I'll give you a Rousing Doozer Apology.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.913
An RDA?

11:03.372 --> 11:04.790
You've got a deal.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.168
Now, mind if I hum the rest of the way?

11:08.669 --> 11:10.587
Fabulous.
Sing along if you know the words.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.969
This place is vibey.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.013
I could paint in here.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.933
I could dance in here.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.018
Should I move here?

11:25.102 --> 11:26.979
I'm just excited.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.858
But I can't believe my friends
didn't believe me.

11:30.941 --> 11:32.067
They're wrong.

11:32.150 --> 11:37.990
They're wrong. They're wrong.
They're wrong.

11:38.073 --> 11:41.410
Right. This is the right way.

11:41.493 --> 11:46.415
Right way. Right way. Right way.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.126
I love this place!

11:50.794 --> 11:51.920
Love!

11:52.004 --> 11:56.175
Love. Love. Love.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.848
Forging my own path
No looking back

12:04.600 --> 12:08.395
It finally feels like
I'm on the right path

12:08.478 --> 12:10.939
For the first time I'm sure

12:11.023 --> 12:16.069
For the first time I know
Where I wanna go

12:16.153 --> 12:18.363
Where I wanna go

12:20.782 --> 12:23.827
I don't know
What my friends are talkin' 'bout

12:26.079 --> 12:29.625
I made the right choice
I don't have a doubt

12:29.708 --> 12:31.710
For the first time, it's clear

12:32.294 --> 12:34.755
For the first time, I know

12:34.838 --> 12:36.840
Where I wanna go

12:37.424 --> 12:39.885
Where I wanna go

12:46.475 --> 12:48.393
Good seats, here we come.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.020
We should be getting close now.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.897
Says we're coming up on the Dangerous Dip.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.609
Dangerous Dip?
I don't like the sound of that.

12:57.736 --> 12:58.904
That was it?

12:59.613 --> 13:00.739
Yeah, yeah.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.200
It says it's a dangerous dip
only for Doozers.

13:04.743 --> 13:05.744
Coming through.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.080
Hey, Doozers.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.123
That Doozer Dip strikes again.

13:10.207 --> 13:13.502
-You're lucky you didn't get hurt worse.
-You'll be back to work in three minutes.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.587
If I'm not constructing, who am I?

13:15.671 --> 13:18.048
Bumpy ride. Here we go.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.637
What's wrong, Wembley?

13:23.720 --> 13:26.056
I'm just worried about Mokey.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.934
Well, you know Mokey.
She's just going her own way.

13:29.017 --> 13:32.020
Hey, you know, my Uncle Matt
sent me a postcard about that.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.106
Would it make you feel better
if I read it to ya?

13:35.107 --> 13:37.276
Your friendship
always makes me feel better.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.653
-Yours does.
-No, yours does.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.406
-Yours does.
-No, no, no. Yours does.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.491
-Yours does.
-Okay.

13:44.575 --> 13:45.576
No, yours does!

13:45.659 --> 13:49.246
Walk and talk, everybody. Walk and talk.

13:51.039 --> 13:55.627
Well. "Dear Nephew Gobo and friends..."
That's all you guys.

13:56.170 --> 13:59.798
I recently stumbled
upon something chilling:

13:59.882 --> 14:03.177
Silly Creatures being forced to move
in an endless circle

14:03.260 --> 14:06.138
on something called a "Silly Slippy."

14:06.221 --> 14:10.100
Their only crime?
Being born with blades for feet.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.978
The poor things were screaming in terror.

14:14.438 --> 14:17.274
Luckily, I was there
to save these poor creatures.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.484
Watch this, my fancy friend.

14:22.321 --> 14:26.116
Break free, Silly Creatures!
You don't have to all go the same way!

14:27.492 --> 14:30.621
You should've seen me, Gobo.
I was poetry in motion.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.458
Everyone was so appreciative of me...

14:35.459 --> 14:38.504
that they placed me
in some sort of reward box.

14:38.587 --> 14:42.925
I thought I had freed them,
but then their ferocious captor returned.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.052
A giant slidey monster.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.055
I didn't hesitate
to meet the beast head-on.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.348
I'm coming!

14:51.058 --> 14:54.311
I mounted
and tamed the beast all on my own.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.647
Then I took a victory lap
to show the Silly Creatures

14:56.730 --> 14:58.649
it was no longer in control.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.193
All clear now. No need to worry.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.112
Did they love me.

15:04.196 --> 15:08.867
And as a memento of my bravery,
I'm sending you a section of Silly Slippy.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.830
"Let it serve as a reminder
that fortune favors those

15:13.914 --> 15:16.291
who aren't afraid to go their own way.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.544
Love, your Uncle Travelling Matt.

15:18.627 --> 15:23.090
PS I know you miss me.
PPS I'd miss me too."

15:23.590 --> 15:25.968
I can't wait to see the Silly Slippy,
Wembley.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.052
Yeah.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.350
Must've got lost.

15:34.059 --> 15:38.397
Yeah. Well, like I was saying, Wembley,
Mokey's just following her own path.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.694
I'm having such a good time in here.

15:43.777 --> 15:47.781
But I don't wanna miss
the Merggle Moon Migration.

15:47.865 --> 15:52.786
Miss it. Miss it.

15:53.495 --> 15:56.123
Yeah. Well, I don't want to.

15:56.206 --> 16:00.961
Don't want to. Don't want to.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.755
Yeah, okay. Okay.

16:04.882 --> 16:07.759
Well, I'm not digging that vibe.
Kinda getting worried.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.596
Worried. Worried.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.434
Starting to wonder
if that map was right after all.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.269
Hey, you know what?

16:17.352 --> 16:19.980
I'm just gonna get outta here.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.691
Get outta here. Get outta here.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.819
-Well, which way?
-Which way? Which way?

16:25.903 --> 16:30.324
But now when I look back
The path is changed

16:30.407 --> 16:31.575
It changed

16:31.658 --> 16:34.077
Did I make the right choice?

16:34.161 --> 16:36.705
-I'm second-guessing
-Oh, no!

16:36.788 --> 16:39.541
-No, I don't feel so sure
-Unsure

16:39.625 --> 16:41.877
-About anything
-About anything

16:41.960 --> 16:45.714
Did I make the right choice?
I'm second-guessing

16:45.797 --> 16:46.798
What do you do?

16:46.882 --> 16:49.176
And I don't know
And I don't know

16:49.259 --> 16:51.762
And I don't know
Where I wanna go

16:51.845 --> 16:52.888
Where do you go?

16:52.971 --> 16:56.016
-Where I wanna go anymore
-Where do you go?

16:56.099 --> 16:57.392
-And I don't know
-Don't know

16:57.476 --> 16:58.477
-And I don't know
-Don't know

16:58.560 --> 16:59.728
-And I don't know
-Don't know

16:59.811 --> 17:01.355
-Where I wanna go
-Where do you go?

17:01.438 --> 17:03.982
Where I wanna go anymore

17:05.400 --> 17:06.443
No!

17:06.527 --> 17:08.069
No!

17:08.153 --> 17:09.445
This isn't right.

17:09.530 --> 17:11.698
This isn't right.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.035
-Am I lost?
-Lost. Lost.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.747
-I'm trapped.
-Trapped. Trapped.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.375
Help!

17:22.835 --> 17:27.673
Really? No echo at that one?
The one time I could use it?

17:27.756 --> 17:28.966
Okay.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.554
We're almost there.

17:33.637 --> 17:36.473
Yeah. You think
they'll still have good seats? Or--

17:36.557 --> 17:39.309
Enough with the seats!

17:39.393 --> 17:41.478
Help!

17:42.646 --> 17:45.816
Wembley, come on. Let's go.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.318
But I think I heard something.

17:48.402 --> 17:50.612
Okay, okay. It's all right. Just breathe.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.865
Just breathe.

17:52.948 --> 17:56.493
You'll think of something.
You've been right all night.

17:56.577 --> 18:00.581
-You've been right all night.
-Right!

18:01.206 --> 18:02.958
Right.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.169
But is that right?

18:05.252 --> 18:08.130
Because I also ignored real information,

18:08.213 --> 18:11.633
and it led me into an echo chamber,
and now I'm in trouble.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.511
Now you're talking.

18:15.137 --> 18:19.600
Maybe there's a time for feelings
and a time for facts.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.101
That's right.

18:21.185 --> 18:23.478
Maybe I wanted to be right so badly,

18:23.562 --> 18:26.398
that I didn't listen to anything that
made me feel wrong,

18:26.481 --> 18:27.482
even true things.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.151
Holler!

18:29.234 --> 18:33.030
And now I'm lost and stuck
and may never see my friends again.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.658
Unless you all will help me.

18:36.742 --> 18:39.536
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.830
You saw the light,
and that's all we wanted.

18:43.290 --> 18:47.628
-Help!
-Help!

18:47.711 --> 18:49.171
Help!

18:49.922 --> 18:51.548
It's Mokey! Dig!

18:53.425 --> 18:55.260
Mokey? Oh, no!

18:55.344 --> 18:56.970
Let's move these rocks.

18:57.054 --> 18:58.597
We'll be there in a second!

18:58.680 --> 18:59.973
-Careful!
-Keep going!

19:00.057 --> 19:02.017
-Help!
-Go, go!

19:02.100 --> 19:04.102
-Mokey!
-Mokey!

19:04.186 --> 19:06.230
Mokey, you're un-lost.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.733
You came back for me.
But I was so stubborn.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.945
You all tried to tell me the truth,
and I didn't listen.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.113
Echo chambers
make you feel like you're right,

19:15.197 --> 19:17.908
but by the time you realize you're wrong,
you're in too deep.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.535
-And then--
-Mokey. Mokey.

19:19.618 --> 19:21.870
I really wanna talk about this,

19:21.954 --> 19:26.917
but if we don't get a move on,
we're gonna miss the Merggles.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.877
-Right, right.
-We'll help you up.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.546
-Come on.
-Take my hand.

19:30.629 --> 19:35.592
Cotterpin, I hope you have
your Rousing Doozer Apology ready

19:35.676 --> 19:39.388
because there is absolutely no way there--

19:40.347 --> 19:42.474
There are radishes out here.

19:42.558 --> 19:44.101
Yes! I knew it!

19:44.893 --> 19:46.979
Aren't they beautiful?

19:47.604 --> 19:51.692
For as long as I've known
how to grind a radish into a fine powder

19:51.775 --> 19:56.029
to make Doozer sticks,
I thought I knew every place they grew.

19:56.113 --> 20:01.076
Cotterpin, you've taught me we need
to add new facts to old assumptions.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.621
And now, I owe you
a Rousing Doozer Apology.

20:04.705 --> 20:07.916
You don't owe me anything at all.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.626
I'm sorry!

20:10.586 --> 20:12.713
Thank you, Architect.

20:12.796 --> 20:15.716
Oh, boy. Don't mention it.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.719
Everyone's leaving.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.182
We missed it.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.310
Best thing ever! Where were you?

20:26.393 --> 20:28.270
I saved you seats in the front row.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.147
The seats!

20:30.814 --> 20:33.108
I'm so, so, so, so sorry.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.861
It's okay, Mokey. Doom is inevitable.

20:35.944 --> 20:39.031
So all of this is ultimately meaningless.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.116
That Merggle Queen,

20:41.200 --> 20:43.952
she makes me feel
a hundred years old again.

20:44.786 --> 20:45.954
She's quite beautiful.

20:46.038 --> 20:48.832
Yes. Some show, hey, young Fraggles?

20:48.916 --> 20:50.459
No.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.169
Don't tell me you missed it.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.172
-We missed it.
-I told you not to tell me that!

20:57.424 --> 20:59.218
Let's go home.

20:59.927 --> 21:03.764
That's a shame. It happens so seldom.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.140
Look at those bubbles.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.476
Look at the bubbles!

21:07.559 --> 21:09.061
-What?
-What?

21:09.144 --> 21:11.813
I have a feeling that
something amazing is--

21:13.065 --> 21:16.151
There I go with my feelings again.
They're probably nothing.

21:16.235 --> 21:18.445
There is something going on here.

21:18.529 --> 21:19.530
Yeah.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.783
There's nothing about this
in the Fraggle Folio of Facts.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.495
Here she comes.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.872
My Queen, you're back.

21:29.581 --> 21:33.752
Of course, I am.
It's time for the main event.

21:33.836 --> 21:37.256
And I'm not talking about you,
you silver fox.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.383
Catch me, Henchy.

21:40.843 --> 21:44.346
No Fraggle has ever seen this before,
whatever this is.

21:44.429 --> 21:47.891
Everyone just normally leaves
after the Migration Dance.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.271
We'll call this one Herggle.

21:55.399 --> 21:59.695
And here comes Derggle
and Ferggle and Berggle

21:59.778 --> 22:01.280
and Larry.

22:04.825 --> 22:07.494
So the Merggle Moon Migration
is really about...

22:07.578 --> 22:10.831
The birth of a new generation. Yes.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.834
Under the light of the Blue Moon,

22:13.917 --> 22:15.836
we welcome new love,

22:15.919 --> 22:19.798
new stories, new strength and new beauty.

22:21.425 --> 22:24.511
Moon, moon, magic light

22:24.595 --> 22:27.764
Come and touch our lives tonight

22:27.848 --> 22:31.059
Soon, soon, deep and bright

22:31.143 --> 22:34.813
Sleep a sleep of peace tonight, night

22:40.944 --> 22:47.409
Come to us now
Come to us

22:47.492 --> 22:53.707
Come to us now
Come to us

22:53.790 --> 22:59.796
Shine on us now
Shine on us

23:00.339 --> 23:03.300
Shine on us now

23:03.383 --> 23:09.306
Shine on us now

23:14.853 --> 23:16.897
Come on, come on, come on

23:22.444 --> 23:23.820
Come on

23:24.738 --> 23:28.075
We would've missed this
if it wasn't for you, Mokey Fraggle.

23:28.158 --> 23:31.954
Henchy, add it
to the Fraggle Folio of Facts.

23:32.037 --> 23:33.247
Right away.

23:34.331 --> 23:35.749
Every time.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.585
Honestly, at this point, it's on me.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.509
Well, Moke, turns out facts are important,

23:45.592 --> 23:47.761
but you notice things
that a lot of us miss.

23:47.845 --> 23:49.972
Don't ignore that either, eh?

23:50.055 --> 23:51.849
Thanks, Gobo. I won't.

23:54.017 --> 23:56.103
Hey, and who's got the best seats now?

23:57.104 --> 24:00.107
Moon, yeah

24:00.983 --> 24:02.943
Your light

24:03.610 --> 24:05.904
Come on and shine

24:06.947 --> 24:09.366
Shine on us right now

24:11.368 --> 24:14.371
Shine on us now

24:14.454 --> 24:18.625
Shine on us

24:19.793 --> 24:23.046
Now

24:24.423 --> 24:25.799
Yeah!

24:27.926 --> 24:29.678
What an incredible night, Wembley?

24:31.555 --> 24:32.806
Wembley?

24:33.891 --> 24:34.892
Wembley.

24:39.563 --> 24:42.065
Something big is happening.
Sprocket, wake up.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.319
Sprocket, fresh dog treats.

24:48.030 --> 24:49.656
Sorry to pull the treat card.

24:50.157 --> 24:51.283
That wasn't cool.

24:51.742 --> 24:55.078
The baby turtles are hatching.
I didn't want you to miss it.

24:55.162 --> 24:57.247
Look at those turtle buds go!

24:57.331 --> 25:00.209
Can you believe we're seeing
the birth of a new generation?

25:03.295 --> 25:05.631
I can still hear that.
