-Good, good, this is M.K.

04:06.855 --> 04:09.423
Hey. Nice to meet you.

04:09.466 --> 04:12.687
M.K. and I were just shooting
some testimonials together.

04:12.730 --> 04:13.818
Cool, very cool.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.569
Skateboarding should be
a part of the Olympics.

04:25.613 --> 04:29.051
It's like dangerous,
you've gotta be skilled.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.009
-Yeah.
-Whatever, I'm telling ya,

04:31.053 --> 04:32.576
it's happening.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.405
Denver's gonna have the Olympics
within the next 20 years.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.407
Yeah, right,
they had their chance.

04:37.451 --> 04:40.584
Oh, what, they had
that false start once?

04:40.628 --> 04:42.369
-That's nothing.
-Psh.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.511
That's my building.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.557
Is Jake up there?

04:56.600 --> 04:59.037
Yeah, he's probably passed out.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.302
You wanna come up?

05:04.347 --> 05:05.043
Sure.

05:18.056 --> 05:18.927
This is it.

05:19.797 --> 05:20.581
Cute!

05:23.758 --> 05:25.803
How long have you been here?

05:25.847 --> 05:27.196
A couple of months,

05:27.239 --> 05:29.677
ever since I moved
to New York City.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.070
You know, me and Jake
have known each other

05:32.114 --> 05:33.376
since I was like five,

05:33.420 --> 05:35.987
so he told me
that he had an open room

05:36.031 --> 05:37.946
so I moved here from Boulder.

05:37.989 --> 05:40.035
-Aw, buddies.
-Yeah.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.821
Um, do you want a drink?

05:43.865 --> 05:45.214
Only if you let me make it.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.564
Okay!

05:47.608 --> 05:49.087
I'm not gonna roofie you
or anything.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.959
That's not creepy at all.

05:56.965 --> 05:57.966
Sorry about the mess.

06:02.318 --> 06:05.234
-Vodka?
-Yeah, is that okay?

06:05.277 --> 06:06.148
Yeah.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.855
Hottest bartender
in six counties.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.907
So you pretty much
freelance at True Healing

06:25.950 --> 06:27.517
and serve at that restaurant?

06:27.561 --> 06:29.127
Yeah.

06:29.171 --> 06:32.174
I'd rather be
on a stage somewhere, but...

06:32.217 --> 06:34.916
Sorry, I fucking work
at a coffee shop.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.701
To shitty jobs.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.008
Cheers.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.633
May I just use the restroom
real quick?

06:56.677 --> 06:58.722
Yeah, yeah,
it's right down the hall.

07:32.713 --> 07:33.453
Make yourself at home.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.111
So this is my spot.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.767
It's really nice.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.533
-Is this cool?
-Yeah.

09:06.676 --> 09:07.895
Wait, Yuri, did you hear that?

09:08.591 --> 09:09.592
What?

09:11.768 --> 09:12.769
Yuri, stop.

09:16.991 --> 09:17.774
Jake?

09:27.044 --> 09:27.654
Jake?

09:30.439 --> 09:31.745
Jake, you all right, man?

09:35.357 --> 09:36.140
Jesus.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.708
Hey, hey!

09:38.752 --> 09:40.754
Jake! Jake!

09:40.797 --> 09:41.842
Jake!

09:41.885 --> 09:43.452
Jake, look at me!

09:43.495 --> 09:45.106
-I'm gonna call 911.
-Oh, my gosh.

09:45.802 --> 09:46.803
Oh, my God.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.022
Call, now, now, now!

09:48.065 --> 09:49.458
Jake, Jake!

09:49.501 --> 09:50.938
Hey, yes, I have an emergency.

09:50.981 --> 09:55.072
It's 171 102nd Street,
Apartment 5F.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.163
Yeah, it's my roommate,
he's throwing up

09:59.207 --> 10:00.338
and having a seizure right now.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.558
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.087
Hold on.

10:12.481 --> 10:12.960
Yeah?

10:13.830 --> 10:15.136
I'm an EMT.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.094
I was next door and I heard
what was going on.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.749
Uh, okay.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.498
-Who is this?
-Hey!

10:29.541 --> 10:31.718
Hey, get out, get out.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.023
Hey, are you okay?

10:33.067 --> 10:35.156
Yeah, no, no, no,
somebody's here to help.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.201
What? No.
No, I don't know what he ate.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.166
Go get some water.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.001
I'm just getting him
a glass of water.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.481
No, for him.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.527
The guy--the EMT,
he told me to get one.

10:59.702 --> 11:00.529
What?

11:01.530 --> 11:02.357
No water?

11:02.792 --> 11:04.054
Hey, what--

11:04.098 --> 11:06.013
You got this under control.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.841
They told me
not to give him any water.

11:07.884 --> 11:08.580
Then don't.

11:08.624 --> 11:09.756
Wait for the ambulance.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.167
Hey, sir, sir!

11:32.256 --> 11:33.736
He's unresponsive,
we gotta go.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.347
Can you just ask them?

12:21.175 --> 12:23.264
They said we just have to wait.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.614
I have to go to work
at the restaurant tomorrow.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.182
You can go.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.227
I'm just gonna stay here
in case he needs something.

12:31.925 --> 12:32.490
Okay.

12:33.709 --> 12:34.666
I'll call you tomorrow.

12:35.537 --> 12:36.190
Okay.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.367
-I'll pray for him.
-Bye.

12:41.499 --> 12:42.196
Okay.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.114
Yuri.

12:48.593 --> 12:49.072
Yuri!

12:50.552 --> 12:51.031
Yuri.

12:52.293 --> 12:53.598
I'm Dr. Kline.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.821
We have him stabilized,
but he's exhausted.

13:04.609 --> 13:05.828
Hey, dude.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.612
What happened, man?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.832
Did you notice anything strange
in his behavior

13:09.876 --> 13:11.181
the last time you saw him?

13:11.921 --> 13:12.792
No, I mean...

13:14.706 --> 13:17.579
Hey, bud, I'm taking off.
Are you gonna be all right?

13:19.581 --> 13:20.930
Yeah, I'm good.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.149
Feel better, man.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.979
I guess he didn't
go to work today.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.458
We immediately thought
meningitis,

13:27.502 --> 13:30.766
but despite the sweating,
there is no fever

13:30.810 --> 13:33.160
and no increased
white blood cell count,

13:33.203 --> 13:35.771
and that rules out viral
or bacterial infection.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.469
So what could it be?

13:39.862 --> 13:41.168
We scanned his brain.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.649
We didn't find
any blocked blood flow

13:44.693 --> 13:46.608
or inflammation.

13:46.651 --> 13:49.045
Did he have a history
of seizures?

13:49.089 --> 13:50.046
No, I don't think so.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.094
Then that leads me to toxicosis.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.052
It's poisoning.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.490
Can't say exactly what,

13:59.534 --> 14:02.406
but something potent
and chemical.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.365
So is he going to be okay?

14:04.408 --> 14:05.801
He's stable.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.324
We'll keep an eye on him
overnight

14:07.368 --> 14:08.412
and we'll call you tomorrow.

14:15.202 --> 14:15.855
Okay.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.917
Hey, Dr. Kline,
it's Yuri Burkin.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.616
Um, I'm just
returning your call.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.226
I was wondering
what's going on with Jake.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.662
Yuri, I'm sorry.

16:51.706 --> 16:54.013
Jake--Jake died this morning.

16:54.056 --> 16:54.926
What?

16:55.318 --> 16:57.146
He started seizing again
at 6 AM,

16:57.190 --> 17:00.062
he had respiratory failure,
which led to cardiac failure.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.543
No, you said
he was gonna be fine!

17:02.586 --> 17:04.022
I'm sorry, we thought he was.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.286
-Why didn't you call me?
-We tried you.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.027
We're notifying his family.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.593
We haven't gotten
the test results back,

17:09.637 --> 17:12.074
but we're gonna keep you
in the loop on this, okay?

17:12.944 --> 17:14.642
Okay.

17:14.685 --> 17:15.817
Yuri, take care.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.128
Hello?

18:06.172 --> 18:08.348
I'm Samantha Freemont,
Medical Examiner.

18:10.001 --> 18:10.828
Can I come in?

18:18.836 --> 18:19.315
Well...

18:26.105 --> 18:27.497
There's the sweat residue.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.066
That's a lot of sweat
for no fever.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.116
Yum, yum.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.469
This doesn't look
like any food poisoning

18:42.512 --> 18:44.297
-I've ever seen.
-No?

18:45.167 --> 18:46.734
No.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.388
More like ingested anthrax.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.825
Anthrax?

18:50.868 --> 18:54.263
Just kidding,
there would've been fever.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.047
So we'll submit this
to toxicology.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.182
Did he usually eat here or out?

19:00.226 --> 19:01.575
I mean, the kitchen was nasty,

19:01.618 --> 19:03.620
but he still made food
a few times a week.

19:03.664 --> 19:06.362
-Hmm.
-He had pasta the other night

19:06.406 --> 19:08.669
and I saved some of the sauce.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.192
I can take that.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.846
Maybe something got in it.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.369
Rat poison perhaps.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.765
Did Jake have a job?

19:17.808 --> 19:20.855
Yeah, he worked
at a self-help company.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.248
It's called True Healing.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.901
He shot trauma interviews.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.077
True Healing.

19:27.775 --> 19:30.343
Any exposure to chemicals
or pesticides out there?

19:31.605 --> 19:33.302
I don't know, I don't think so.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.437
What about drugs?

19:37.480 --> 19:39.526
-Was he a junkie?
-Jake?

19:39.569 --> 19:41.571
No, I've never seen him
take any drugs.

19:41.615 --> 19:45.053
He's had a little weed,
you know, once in a while, but--

19:45.096 --> 19:46.446
Just a little weed, eh?

19:47.577 --> 19:49.100
Well, maybe yesterday he decided

19:49.144 --> 19:51.668
to try ecstasy
for the first time.

19:51.712 --> 19:52.887
Took the wrong hit.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.855
I'm not seeing
or smelling any mold,

20:04.899 --> 20:06.379
so mycotoxins are out.

20:09.556 --> 20:10.774
As far as the rat poison,

20:10.818 --> 20:12.950
it would have to be
a whole packet,

20:12.994 --> 20:15.344
and I just don't see
how that could get in the food.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.224
Here's the sauce, anyway.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.138
I'll get it to the lab.

20:27.182 --> 20:30.490
But I think it's a case
of contaminated drugs.

20:30.533 --> 20:33.667
I just can't see Jake
taking drugs.

20:33.710 --> 20:36.713
Well, there's really
not much else it can be.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.889
Unless it's homicide by poison.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.021
When will we know?

20:40.064 --> 20:42.632
All right, I live here,
I need to know.

20:42.676 --> 20:45.722
Well, the toxicology test
will be done in two weeks.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.293
But listen, I'll do
a full autopsy on him

20:51.337 --> 20:53.295
within a few days.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.905
That may give us
additional insight.

20:55.776 --> 20:56.603
Okay?

20:57.865 --> 20:59.823
Just don't go back in the room.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.957
And if you're concerned
about the apartment,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.480
stay with a friend.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.640
Yes, that's why I've been
telling you to run every day.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.947
I know, I know--

23:46.990 --> 23:48.775
I'm g--I'm gonna have
to call you back, Paul.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.385
Here you are.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.605
Guys, I am so sorry, again,
about that wait.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.346
Um, I asked for barbecue sauce?

24:38.389 --> 24:39.478
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

24:40.566 --> 24:41.610
These fries are cold.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.872
-Could I get some new ones?
-Uh-huh!

24:42.916 --> 24:44.308
-Yeah.
-All right, I'll take a burger.

24:44.352 --> 24:45.658
Burger, you got it.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.486
Actually, no,
I'm sorry, hold on,

24:47.529 --> 24:48.530
I don't want a burger.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.185
-Miss?
-Yes?

24:51.228 --> 24:52.621
Can I get some more coffee,
please?

25:00.673 --> 25:02.892
Mary Kate?

25:02.936 --> 25:04.067
-Yeah?
-There's some guy here

25:04.111 --> 25:05.068
looking for you?

25:12.685 --> 25:13.207
Yuri.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.434
I'm so sorry about Jake.

25:25.001 --> 25:25.698
Yeah.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.137
So did you take the day off?

25:30.833 --> 25:31.355
Yeah.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.534
That's good,
you should just take some time.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.536
I was online all day
trying to find out more

25:37.579 --> 25:38.754
about True Healing.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.277
They don't really have
that much online.

25:40.321 --> 25:43.672
Yeah, I know, their website's
under construction.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.195
They've got a few business
listings,

25:45.239 --> 25:46.849
but there's really
nothing there.

25:46.893 --> 25:48.677
They're putting together
a video library.

25:48.721 --> 25:51.245
Psh, yeah, a video library.

25:51.288 --> 25:54.988
You know, they're not
just interviewing people.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.685
I found something
in Jake's room.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.078
-What?
-A bug.

25:58.774 --> 25:59.819
A bug?

25:59.862 --> 26:01.821
A microphone.

26:01.864 --> 26:05.607
They planted it inside of
a trophy that they gave him.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.044
-Oh, my God, that's crazy.
-Yeah.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.481
-Why would they do that?
-I don't know.

26:10.525 --> 26:11.700
Did you notice anything

26:11.744 --> 26:13.136
when you worked with Jake
at True Healing?

26:13.180 --> 26:15.530
Um... no.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.532
Not really.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.317
I did see some of those trophies
lying around.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.450
Why the hell would they
be spying on people?

26:28.499 --> 26:29.588
That guy.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.117
What the hell was he doing?

26:49.216 --> 26:50.870
Can I stay with you for a while?

26:52.262 --> 26:53.612
You can stay with me tonight.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.496
-Hey!
-Hi there.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.892
Alisa, this is my friend Yuri.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.763
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.156
He's a skateboarder.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.898
Wow, great.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.911
-Sick!
-I know, I'm sick.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.273
This is great,
I've got a houseboy now.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.493
What's a houseboy?

27:49.537 --> 27:51.931
It's a boy in my house
that does what I want.

27:54.890 --> 27:57.327
Houseboy, take off my shoe.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.635
I'll take off your shoe.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.984
And the other one.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.728
And now rub my feet.

28:09.644 --> 28:10.645
You're funny.

28:16.216 --> 28:19.654
Now I need you
to open Sparky's skull.

28:20.524 --> 28:21.961
Sparky.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.614
And hand me my stash.

28:29.490 --> 28:30.665
Good housie.

28:31.405 --> 28:32.319
Shut up.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.839
Stop.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.710
I want you to get naked first.

29:17.451 --> 29:18.452
Over there.

29:21.455 --> 29:22.282
Okay.

30:36.965 --> 30:37.661
You okay?

30:38.706 --> 30:39.402
Yeah.

30:41.187 --> 30:41.970
You sure?

30:42.753 --> 30:43.842
Yes.

30:46.192 --> 30:48.455
What is this for?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.587
They're just from
the restaurant I work at.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.677
Hate that place.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.114
I wanna quit so bad.

30:57.464 --> 30:58.508
You should!

31:01.381 --> 31:02.643
You're right.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.749
They're hiring a replacement
for Jake at True Healing.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.536
-Already?
-Yeah.

31:26.580 --> 31:27.929
Nick just sent me an email.

31:31.237 --> 31:32.847
You're not planning
on doing it, are you?

31:34.849 --> 31:37.721
It's just they pay really well.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.723
That company, I mean...

31:39.767 --> 31:41.290
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.991
You're probably right.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.949
Like I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.998
You don't need to protect me,
you know.

31:55.261 --> 31:56.044
I know.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.247
Give it up for Jake.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.075
A hundred interviews, wow.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.559
True Healing, True Healing,
True Healing.

32:32.602 --> 32:33.560
True Healing.

33:38.886 --> 33:41.280
-Maybe it's in the footage.
-It's not in the footage,

33:41.323 --> 33:43.543
I checked the footage!

33:43.586 --> 33:45.675
We don't have it, it's gone.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.547
Who knows--who knows where--

33:55.250 --> 33:56.338
Can I help you?

33:56.382 --> 33:58.297
I'm here for the job opening.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.038
Do you have an appointment?

34:00.081 --> 34:02.170
No, I thought you might
be able to fit me in.

34:02.910 --> 34:03.432
Hold on.

34:09.656 --> 34:10.438
Come on.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.356
-I'm Jessica, by the way.
-Yuri.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.792
Nice to meet you.

34:15.835 --> 34:17.489
I'm gonna introduce you to Nick.
He runs the company.

34:21.885 --> 34:22.408
Nick?

34:24.714 --> 34:26.063
Hi, I'm Yuri Burkin.

34:28.543 --> 34:30.155
And I'm Nick Frankenthaler.

34:32.331 --> 34:33.766
I'm here about the job opening?

34:39.512 --> 34:41.775
We haven't advertised that yet.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.036
How do you know about it?

34:44.734 --> 34:47.085
I met a guy at a party
who told me about it.

34:51.263 --> 34:52.219
What was his name?

34:54.179 --> 34:55.049
I don't remember.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.922
Yeah, all I remember
was True Healing.

35:04.580 --> 35:05.538
Well, he was correct.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.105
We need a new videographer.

35:10.238 --> 35:11.587
Bye, Jessica, thank you.

35:11.631 --> 35:12.675
-Bye.
-I'll see you later.

35:29.518 --> 35:30.128
Atta boy.

37:29.682 --> 37:30.248
Yuri.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.902
Welcome aboard.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.208
-Thanks.
-You all right?

37:34.252 --> 37:35.992
-Yeah.
-Good.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.690
-Here.
-Thanks.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.953
Charles. Quit that.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.824
This is Yuri.

37:41.868 --> 37:43.130
He is our new videographer.

37:43.173 --> 37:44.914
I want you to show him
the system, all right?

37:44.958 --> 37:46.264
-Yes.
-And do it before 10

37:46.307 --> 37:48.135
so we can get him out
into the field.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.005
Okay, sir.

37:50.093 --> 37:50.659
All right.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.185
Hey, I'm Yuri.

37:55.229 --> 37:56.665
Uh, Charles.

37:56.709 --> 37:59.581
I'm the Office Manager
and Chief Information Officer.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.672
This is the directory screen.

38:08.111 --> 38:10.331
This is our video library.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.247
Each of these is
a video interview.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.816
Our video library contains
hundreds of interviews

38:16.859 --> 38:18.296
about every kind of trauma.

38:18.339 --> 38:24.214
So from being in a car accident
to having an illness.

38:24.258 --> 38:27.870
We monetize the content
by selling access

38:27.914 --> 38:29.742
to psychological professionals,

38:29.785 --> 38:32.832
universities, and companies.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.616
So you sell these videos
to companies?

38:34.660 --> 38:37.184
Like what companies?

38:37.227 --> 38:40.535
Um, our primary client
is Griffen,

38:40.579 --> 38:43.364
a pharmaceutical company.

38:43.408 --> 38:46.498
They use the videos
for research into trauma

38:46.541 --> 38:48.369
and how they can treat it.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.110
Ah.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.678
Yes, also at some point,
we'll be launching

38:52.721 --> 38:55.071
the public website,
TrueHealing.com,

38:55.115 --> 38:57.726
which will feature
the video library

38:57.770 --> 38:59.946
and be a resource to people
with similar traumas.

39:01.730 --> 39:02.775
Okay.

39:04.254 --> 39:05.908
Do you know
where Jessica is today?

39:06.996 --> 39:07.997
She's not in today.

39:14.134 --> 39:14.613
Okay.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.051
Let's get you set up
at your station.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.707
This still has stuff
from the last person.

39:22.534 --> 39:23.535
Yeah, I'm sorry.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.019
So what happened
to the last guy?

39:30.063 --> 39:31.107
It didn't work out.

39:33.501 --> 39:34.676
We had to let him go.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.419
So get set up here.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.334
Nick wants to train you
at 10 o'clock.

40:47.662 --> 40:48.750
That was way too slow.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.144
You have to speed that up.

40:51.971 --> 40:52.798
Got it.

40:54.539 --> 40:59.282
Okay, now this city
is a cauldron of trauma.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.155
There are recent developments

41:02.198 --> 41:05.854
that we wanna capitalize on
for these interviews.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.988
There are specific questions
that we ask

41:09.031 --> 41:10.685
to prompt these subjects.

41:10.729 --> 41:11.860
It's all in the packet.

41:13.079 --> 41:15.560
Nothing too complex,

41:15.603 --> 41:18.737
but it is vital
that you get it right.

41:20.869 --> 41:22.436
Ah, Mary Kate.

41:25.178 --> 41:26.919
Do you two know each other?

41:26.962 --> 41:29.008
No, um, hi, Yuri.

41:29.051 --> 41:30.270
M.K.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.533
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.144
M.K. is a regular contributor
to the library.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.060
Uh, come in, sit down.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.684
-Here you go.
-Oh, no thank you.

41:54.947 --> 41:56.818
Let's get started.

41:56.862 --> 42:00.343
Yuri, you've just met M.K.
for an appointment.

42:00.387 --> 42:01.170
Go.

42:04.696 --> 42:06.262
-Um, so as--
-Put the mic on her.

42:21.756 --> 42:25.412
So, as you know,
we're looking for a story

42:25.455 --> 42:30.025
about a recent trauma,
like an injury or an illness.

42:30.069 --> 42:31.679
It can be something
which happened to you

42:31.723 --> 42:33.115
or another person.

42:33.159 --> 42:34.987
Something which happened
to another person?

42:36.031 --> 42:37.163
Yuri, roll camera.

42:38.991 --> 42:40.514
Um, not recent, but...

42:41.776 --> 42:43.517
So there was this one time

42:43.561 --> 42:46.215
when I was probably about 10,

42:46.259 --> 42:49.654
and my mother had kicked me out
of the house for no reason,

42:49.697 --> 42:53.440
so I had to go and live
with my two neighbors,

42:53.483 --> 42:54.572
Bill and Rita.

42:55.703 --> 42:58.053
They were pretty cool at first,

42:58.097 --> 43:00.882
but Bill had
this record collection

43:00.926 --> 43:03.058
down in his basement.

43:03.102 --> 43:06.192
One day, he took me down there
to look at it.

43:07.367 --> 43:08.324
I should've known.

43:10.762 --> 43:14.461
So I'm looking
at one of the records...

43:14.504 --> 43:18.160
and Bill comes over
and he starts touching me.

43:20.336 --> 43:21.511
I'm really scared.

43:23.383 --> 43:26.604
And so he just starts putting
his hands all over me.

43:28.693 --> 43:30.477
Down my pants and everything.

43:35.395 --> 43:37.266
I thought it was over,

43:37.310 --> 43:40.748
and my face
felt like it was burning.

43:42.750 --> 43:46.101
And then he takes
his dick out...

43:46.145 --> 43:51.019
and he makes me open my mouth
and he shoves it in

43:51.063 --> 43:54.632
and starts thrusting
back and forth.

43:57.417 --> 44:00.115
And it just--it hurt so much.

44:07.732 --> 44:09.124
And then he finished.

44:11.736 --> 44:13.346
And I was crying.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.611
And he told me
never to tell anyone.

44:20.614 --> 44:22.007
And I didn't for years.

44:24.183 --> 44:25.488
Did you ever tell the police?

44:25.532 --> 44:26.664
Stick to the script.

44:27.926 --> 44:29.275
No.

44:29.318 --> 44:30.363
So he's still out there?

44:30.406 --> 44:31.190
Yuri!

44:36.369 --> 44:37.457
After this happened,

44:37.500 --> 44:39.067
what effects did it have
on your life?

44:40.765 --> 44:41.722
It ruined it.

44:43.289 --> 44:44.856
And it wasn't the only time
it happened.

44:46.945 --> 44:48.120
What's up with these questions?

44:49.121 --> 44:50.078
Excuse me?

44:54.779 --> 44:57.520
How likely is it that
your trauma might happen again?

44:58.783 --> 45:00.610
Very.

45:00.654 --> 45:02.351
It's like I have a sign
on my head

45:02.395 --> 45:04.527
that says, "Come violate me."

45:07.400 --> 45:10.098
Have you ever considered
medication?

45:10.142 --> 45:12.318
I've thought about it,
but I don't want to try it.

45:13.406 --> 45:14.973
I cut myself instead.

45:15.016 --> 45:16.322
What?

45:16.365 --> 45:17.845
I'm a cutter.

45:17.889 --> 45:19.281
I have a razor in my bag.

45:19.891 --> 45:20.456
Why?

45:20.500 --> 45:22.023
Goddamnit, Yuri.

45:23.155 --> 45:25.940
'Cause it makes me feel better.

45:25.984 --> 45:29.422
I actually keep some blood
in my locket to remind me.

45:32.773 --> 45:33.469
Shit, M.K.

45:33.513 --> 45:35.123
Okay, we're done here.

45:35.167 --> 45:36.734
Cut the camera and come with me.

45:42.130 --> 45:44.393
I don't know what you were
trying to pull in there,

45:44.437 --> 45:47.092
but stick to the goddamn script!

45:47.135 --> 45:48.441
Yeah.

45:48.484 --> 45:50.791
These questions have been
carefully calibrated

45:50.835 --> 45:52.184
to get the information we need.

45:52.227 --> 45:55.404
I don't care
how awkward you feel.

45:55.448 --> 45:57.537
Stick to the goddamn script!

45:57.580 --> 45:58.930
Yes, sir.

45:58.973 --> 46:00.409
And I don't want you
making personal connections

46:00.453 --> 46:02.107
with these subjects.

46:02.150 --> 46:02.977
Got it.

46:06.372 --> 46:06.851
All right.

46:22.562 --> 46:23.345
Thank you.

46:30.265 --> 46:32.964
You'll be going out
to Queens for this one.

46:33.007 --> 46:35.053
Your first subject's name
and address.

46:35.096 --> 46:36.054
He knows you're coming.

46:37.620 --> 46:38.360
Okay.

46:39.666 --> 46:40.319
Good luck.

46:41.233 --> 46:41.973
Thanks.

47:16.224 --> 47:16.964
Hey, M.K.

47:19.097 --> 47:21.099
That was pretty intense
in there.

47:21.142 --> 47:23.318
I hope you're okay.

47:23.362 --> 47:26.191
I didn't know you had been
through anything like that.

47:26.234 --> 47:28.671
It's cool, I'm not bugged out
or anything...

47:29.934 --> 47:31.065
if you wanna talk about it.

47:32.675 --> 47:33.328
Call me.

48:04.620 --> 48:05.926
Hi, Gene?

48:05.970 --> 48:06.622
I'm Yuri.

48:10.452 --> 48:11.192
Come in.

48:12.019 --> 48:12.628
Thanks.

49:35.102 --> 49:35.973
You ready?

49:44.198 --> 49:49.987
Pills... not... working.

49:50.030 --> 49:51.162
Wait, the pills
they gave you?

49:54.078 --> 49:55.166
Was it Sedinox?

50:04.914 --> 50:06.133
Shit.

50:08.744 --> 50:10.094
Hello?

50:10.137 --> 50:11.443
Yuri, it's Samantha Freemont.

50:11.486 --> 50:12.574
Hey.

50:12.618 --> 50:14.228
There's been a development.

50:14.272 --> 50:16.230
I hope you haven't been
back into Jake's room.

50:16.274 --> 50:17.318
Uh, no.

50:17.362 --> 50:18.015
Good.

50:20.365 --> 50:22.541
We did the autopsy
this morning.

50:22.584 --> 50:23.759
Okay.

50:23.803 --> 50:26.197
We were looking for
signs of toxicosis.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.851
Damage to the throat,
the stomach, the intestine.

50:28.895 --> 50:30.114
It wasn't there.

50:30.157 --> 50:31.376
So it wasn't poisoning?

50:31.419 --> 50:32.942
No.

50:32.986 --> 50:35.075
When we opened up
his skull, Yuri,

50:35.119 --> 50:39.297
his brain, there were
tiny holes in his brain.

50:40.733 --> 50:42.082
Holes?

50:42.126 --> 50:43.562
Yes, like a sponge.

50:43.605 --> 50:45.390
He died of an encephalopathy.

50:46.652 --> 50:48.480
Like mad cow disease.

50:48.523 --> 50:52.440
But this one
we've never seen before.

50:55.530 --> 50:56.705
How does it spread?

50:56.749 --> 50:58.142
We don't know.

50:58.185 --> 51:00.057
These prions that cause this,

51:00.100 --> 51:01.797
they're tiny little proteins,

51:01.841 --> 51:03.886
they're smaller
even than a virus.

51:03.930 --> 51:07.586
They could be spread
by eating, body fluids,

51:07.629 --> 51:09.370
or even a cough or a sneeze.

51:09.414 --> 51:11.459
That's not what
I want to hear right now, man.

51:11.503 --> 51:13.113
I'm in the fucking apartment
with a guy

51:13.157 --> 51:14.593
that has that shit.

51:14.636 --> 51:16.029
What?

51:16.073 --> 51:17.987
Yeah, and there's a guy outside
who's spying on us.

51:20.033 --> 51:21.861
Well, give me your address.

51:21.904 --> 51:23.558
I'm gonna come over
with some backup.

51:26.518 --> 51:28.998
Hi, yes, I have an emergency.

51:29.042 --> 51:32.654
50 East 31st Street,
apartment 3F.

51:32.698 --> 51:35.353
Yeah, I got this guy,
he's got this brain disease.

51:35.396 --> 51:37.703
He's sweating, he's gonna
start puking any minute,

51:37.746 --> 51:40.227
and then he's gonna have a
seizure and fucking die.

51:48.453 --> 51:49.671
You have to come now.

51:49.715 --> 51:50.411
Come now.

52:00.378 --> 52:01.466
EMT!

53:22.634 --> 53:23.330
Aww!

53:24.940 --> 53:25.898
Fuck you!

53:27.160 --> 53:28.292
Oh...

53:50.052 --> 53:51.532
-Hello?
-When are they getting here?

53:51.576 --> 53:53.099
-Five minutes maybe.
-Shit!

53:53.142 --> 53:55.275
-The guy's gonna get away.
-Who?

53:55.319 --> 53:56.276
The guy.

54:30.179 --> 54:31.093
Fuck!

57:07.728 --> 57:10.644
Dr. Freemont,
I figured something out.

57:10.688 --> 57:12.167
It's True Healing.

57:12.211 --> 57:15.083
You gotta call me back
as soon as possible.

57:29.576 --> 57:31.839
Dr. Freemont.
I figured something out.

57:31.883 --> 57:33.145
It's True Healing.

57:58.649 --> 57:59.519
Hello?

57:59.563 --> 58:01.695
Hey, it's me. Let me in.

58:01.739 --> 58:02.914
Yeah, the medical examiner,

58:02.957 --> 58:04.742
she told me
it's a new disease,

58:04.785 --> 58:07.440
it like, um,
puts holes in your brain,

58:07.484 --> 58:09.355
makes it like a sponge.

58:09.398 --> 58:12.967
So there were holes
in Jake's brain?

58:13.011 --> 58:14.795
Yeah, that's what she said.

58:14.839 --> 58:17.189
He said he was
getting headaches.

58:17.232 --> 58:21.019
Yeah, these assholes
are the reason he got it.

58:21.062 --> 58:22.803
True Healing knows about it.

58:22.847 --> 58:24.239
They've known about it.

58:24.283 --> 58:25.458
What do you mean?

58:25.502 --> 58:27.112
I mean the whole thing!

58:27.155 --> 58:29.070
The appointment,
the interview.

58:29.114 --> 58:31.638
The whole reason I was there
was to mic Gene.

58:31.682 --> 58:33.205
And as soon as
he started puking,

58:33.248 --> 58:34.641
that biker was right up.

58:35.990 --> 58:38.602
So True Healing
is like a sham?

58:38.645 --> 58:40.299
Yeah, I mean,
they don't give a shit

58:40.342 --> 58:41.692
about people's trauma.

58:41.735 --> 58:44.129
They're targeting people
with this disease.

58:44.172 --> 58:46.784
I knew those guys
were full of shit.

58:46.827 --> 58:48.481
They never cared
what happened to me,

58:48.525 --> 58:50.309
they just wanted
to know about Chris.

58:51.353 --> 58:52.572
Chris?

58:52.616 --> 58:55.488
Chris, yes, he--
he worked at the restaurant

58:55.532 --> 58:58.796
and he died too
like a month ago.

58:58.839 --> 59:01.320
That must be why
True Healing first contacted me

59:01.363 --> 59:03.191
and started doing
interviews with me.

59:03.235 --> 59:04.802
They wanted to know about him!

59:06.891 --> 59:08.632
So they were asking
you about him.

59:08.675 --> 59:10.764
Yes, yes, they asked me--

59:10.808 --> 59:12.636
they asked me what he did
before he died

59:12.679 --> 59:14.942
and all that.

59:14.986 --> 59:17.510
And they had asked me
if I went to his funeral.

59:18.772 --> 59:20.165
They're tracking the disease.

59:22.428 --> 59:24.561
That's why they're
following you.

59:24.604 --> 59:25.910
To see if you're infected.

59:28.216 --> 59:29.435
They're tracking me too.

59:44.145 --> 59:45.364
They must be doing
something illegal

59:45.407 --> 59:46.583
with those samples,
otherwise they wouldn't

59:46.626 --> 59:47.932
need to be so shady about it.

59:50.456 --> 59:52.589
What if they're selling it
to terrorists or something?

59:53.502 --> 59:54.939
God, this is insane.

59:54.982 --> 59:57.376
It's gonna be all right, baby,
I'm gonna figure it out.

59:57.419 --> 59:59.117
You're going back there?

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.031
Yeah.

01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:01.336
Don't try to be a hero, Yuri,

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.773
you're gonna get us
both into trouble.

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:04.078
I won't, I promise.

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:07.038
This is New York City,
not Bumfuck, Idaho.

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:08.605
You don't have a clue.

01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:10.171
Those guys killed Jake, okay?

01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:11.912
I'm not gonna just
let that slide.

01:00:13.784 --> 01:00:15.481
Whatever, just don't
get yourself killed.

01:00:15.524 --> 01:00:17.570
-MK, you don't have to go yet.
-I'm late.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.571
Hold on.

01:01:10.231 --> 01:01:11.319
Charles.

01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:12.538
Oh, God.

01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:15.497
You frightened me, Yuri.

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:16.934
How were your interviews?

01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:19.110
Fine, except one of
the dudes threw up

01:01:19.153 --> 01:01:20.894
and had a seizure
halfway through it.

01:01:20.938 --> 01:01:22.983
No way, he got sick?

01:01:23.027 --> 01:01:25.856
Yeah, I was right there.

01:01:25.899 --> 01:01:28.032
Now I'm coming down
with something.

01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:30.425
No, no, Yuri, you--
no, you're, um...

01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:33.167
you need to...
I shouldn't, um...

01:01:34.865 --> 01:01:36.257
Why you bugging out
so much, Charles?

01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:37.955
Do you know something
that I don't?

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:44.135
No, it's simply that
I have a thing about germs...

01:01:44.178 --> 01:01:45.614
-and I'm concerned.
-You don't like germs?

01:01:45.658 --> 01:01:47.399
-No, but...
-You don't like germs, huh?

01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:51.272
So, uh, wouldn't be good
if I came up close

01:01:51.316 --> 01:01:53.405
and started breathing
all over you, huh?

01:01:53.448 --> 01:01:54.841
Yuri, Yuri, please,
Yuri, Yuri, please.

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:57.539
-Please, please, please.
-What's going on out here?

01:01:57.583 --> 01:01:58.671
Why don't you tell me?

01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:02.544
Tell you what, Yuri?

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.939
What's going on.

01:02:05.983 --> 01:02:07.811
Why was I in a room today
with someone

01:02:07.854 --> 01:02:09.029
with a deadly disease?

01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:14.731
You had a bad interview,
I'm sorry.

01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:18.386
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:19.213
You don't know?

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:22.869
Listen, dude.

01:02:22.913 --> 01:02:24.566
I saw everything,
I know everything.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.744
And on top of that,
I have it on video.

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:30.790
You got 10 seconds
before I call the cops.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.444
Unless you wanna
tell me everything you know

01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:33.314
about this disease.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:37.318
Step inside.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:48.068
It's just precaution.

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.809
Yeah? Why didn't
I get one of those?

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:53.247
We had no way of knowing
your subject would be sick.

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:55.032
Bullshit.

01:02:55.075 --> 01:02:57.077
You knew he might have it,
but you weren't sure.

01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:58.949
That's why that biker
was downstairs,

01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:01.299
waiting to get
a blood sample if he was.

01:03:01.342 --> 01:03:03.344
I told you,
I got everything on video.

01:03:04.519 --> 01:03:05.607
Where's the footage?

01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:08.872
Tell me everything you know
about this disease.

01:03:08.915 --> 01:03:10.787
Has anyone else
seen that tape?

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:12.789
Maybe.

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:22.711
How you feeling, Yuri?

01:03:24.409 --> 01:03:25.453
Getting headaches?

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:28.587
You're infected.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:32.765
You can feel it.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.641
So you go ahead
and threaten me all you want.

01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:41.426
All you're doing
is digging your own grave.

01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:44.733
Well, if I'm gonna die,

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:47.258
then I might as well
take you down with me.

01:03:48.433 --> 01:03:49.826
You don't have to die.

01:03:51.436 --> 01:03:53.568
We have a prototype treatment
for the disease.

01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:56.006
Who?

01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:57.746
Griffen Labs?

01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:59.183
What do you think
we've been doing?

01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:03.056
We're trying to save lives.

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.103
I can save your life.

01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:07.582
But you gotta
give me that video.

01:04:24.643 --> 01:04:26.384
Good choice.

01:04:26.427 --> 01:04:28.038
I have a dose
of the prototype here.

01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:29.909
We can take care of you
right now.

01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:30.779
Have a seat.

01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:41.747
This has done very well
in all of our trials.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:43.749
Give me your arm.

01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:48.623
Yuri, do you want
the treatment or not?

01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:56.762
Excellent.

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:12.430
Stop him, Charles!

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:16.086
Charles!

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.266
That way, hurry!

01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:24.616
Yuri?

01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:27.488
Uh, Nick!

01:05:27.532 --> 01:05:28.185
Nick.

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.904
I got everything I need now.

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:57.170
Hello?

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:58.824
Yuri, where are you?

01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:00.608
Yeah, I'm in Bushwick,
near True Healing.

01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:02.871
We're nearby.
Give me the cross street.

01:06:02.915 --> 01:06:06.136
I'm on Thames,
approaching Varick.

01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:07.920
Stay there, we're coming.

01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:31.248
Yuri, I asked you
to stay in the area,

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:33.946
and instead, I find you
on a street corner in Bushwick

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.166
holding a syringe.

01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:38.820
Sorry, I had to bring down
Nick Frankenthaler

01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:41.475
and his whole
corrupt operation.

01:06:41.519 --> 01:06:43.477
They're doing dirty work
for Big Pharma.

01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:47.699
This is audio
and video evidence.

01:06:47.742 --> 01:06:49.831
Hmph, well, look at you.

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.268
Listen, as a matter of fact,

01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:52.878
I've got some officers
heading over

01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:54.575
to True Healing right now.

01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:55.141
Good.

01:06:56.229 --> 01:06:57.883
-This is Atkins.
-Howdy.

01:06:57.926 --> 01:07:00.668
-What's up?
-That's Jones.

01:07:00.712 --> 01:07:02.627
I brought in the EIS,

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:05.151
the Epidemic
Intelligence Service,

01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:07.458
'cause this situation
is just way beyond

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:08.720
my jurisdiction.

01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:10.896
Well, that's what
we're here for.

01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:13.029
So what you got there, bud?

01:07:13.072 --> 01:07:14.552
Nick said it was
a prototype treatment

01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:16.815
for the disease,
I don't know.

01:07:16.858 --> 01:07:18.643
Prototype.

01:07:18.686 --> 01:07:20.297
They might have a compound
they're testing out

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.081
on this new prion disease,

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:24.214
but I wouldn't inject that
under any circumstances.

01:07:24.257 --> 01:07:25.650
Why?

01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:28.914
Most of these compounds
have horrible side effects,

01:07:28.957 --> 01:07:32.309
or they can even speed up
the progress of the disease.

01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:34.267
I think I'm gonna have
to take it anyways, I...

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.791
I think I have the disease.

01:07:39.577 --> 01:07:42.710
Okay. You may or may not.

01:07:42.754 --> 01:07:44.190
But we're gonna
set up a hospital

01:07:44.234 --> 01:07:46.888
for you and anyone else
who might be infected.

01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:48.542
Tell you what,
give us a few hours

01:07:48.586 --> 01:07:50.370
with that syringe,
we can get a better idea

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:52.285
of what's in that before
you start injecting yourself.

01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:08.345
An encephalopathy.

01:08:09.476 --> 01:08:11.261
Like mad cow disease.

01:08:22.533 --> 01:08:24.143
Hey, why are we here?

01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:26.841
I need you to go up
and lay low for a while.

01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:29.756
Put on some tunes, relax,
drink a bunch of water

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:33.457
while we set up this facility
and run that lab test.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.328
When will you guys be back?

01:08:35.372 --> 01:08:37.156
Give us two or three hours.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.115
Here, put on this mask,

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:40.246
and don't leave
your apartment,

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.639
we have to contain this thing.

01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:02.529
Fuck!

01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:14.759
Yuri.

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:20.591
Yuri!

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:26.640
Yuri!

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:33.778
You're dead.

01:11:14.574 --> 01:11:15.749
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:11:17.447 --> 01:11:19.405
What's with the...

01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:20.972
I'm sick with
what Jake had.

01:11:24.454 --> 01:11:26.151
Are you having headaches?

01:11:26.194 --> 01:11:26.978
Yeah.

01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:29.676
It's bad.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.156
Why are you here then?

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:32.288
I wanted to see you.

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:35.726
I, uh...

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.207
I got all this evidence
against True Healing

01:11:39.251 --> 01:11:40.948
and gave it to
the medical examiner.

01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:42.428
What did you find out?

01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:44.212
They've been collecting
samples of the disease

01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:46.737
for a pharmaceutical company...

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.304
probably to make a drug for it.

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:55.833
So they knew about this
disease starting to happen

01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:57.356
and they didn't care.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.792
They just let people die.

01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:00.054
Right.

01:12:00.098 --> 01:12:01.142
Like guinea pigs.

01:12:02.274 --> 01:12:03.928
Oh my God.

01:12:03.971 --> 01:12:06.409
Now I mean they won't
be able to do it anymore

01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:07.627
because of you.

01:12:07.671 --> 01:12:08.889
You're a hero.

01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:11.152
Hey, what's up?

01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:16.419
Um, this is my friend,
we were just talking.

01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:18.508
-What was your name again?
-Roger.

01:12:18.551 --> 01:12:23.077
Hi, Roger, I'm MK,
and this is Yuri.

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:24.514
What's with the face mask?

01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:25.471
I'm sick.

01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:27.691
With what?

01:12:27.734 --> 01:12:29.170
You don't want to know.

01:12:29.214 --> 01:12:31.129
So is this your
soccer jersey, Roger?

01:12:31.172 --> 01:12:33.392
Yeah, I'm in a league.

01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:35.568
Play three times a week
in season.

01:12:35.612 --> 01:12:37.831
So you're a big jock,
aren't you?

01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:39.093
Yeah.

01:12:39.137 --> 01:12:41.095
Let's go get a table, okay?

01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:42.749
Get us a couple rounds.

01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:43.924
Sounds good to me.

01:12:48.015 --> 01:12:51.584

-Yuri?
-I'm leaving.

01:13:06.077 --> 01:13:07.208
Yuri, wait.

01:13:07.252 --> 01:13:09.254
-Wait, wait, don't go.
-Roger.

01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:11.865
So what, are you gonna
stay with this guy all night?

01:13:11.909 --> 01:13:13.345
Yuri, come on,
don't be like that.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.565
Are you trying to have
another traumatic experience?

01:13:15.608 --> 01:13:16.783
I mean, this guy's
a fucking asshole.

01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:18.350
What?

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.787
I told you, you don't
need to protect me.

01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:23.181
I just care about you.

01:13:23.224 --> 01:13:25.444
Came all the way here
to see you, and it's just

01:13:25.488 --> 01:13:27.359
I'm all messed up.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:30.014
If you need to go
to the hospital, you should.

01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:32.233
I'm just trying
to have some fun, okay?

01:13:32.277 --> 01:13:33.757
Fun, yeah, I get it,

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.020
I just thought
we had something.

01:13:36.063 --> 01:13:38.544
We went out
a couple of times.

01:13:38.588 --> 01:13:41.155
All right,
I gotta go home.

01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:43.331
-Yuri.
-I'll talk to you later.

01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:44.115
Don't worry about him.

and what the hell
happened to your mask?

01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:20.934
I know, sorry.

01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:22.849
You know, you are not
making my life easy.

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:24.155
Now, gimme your keys.

01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:29.116
Get your diseased ass
out to our van.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.683
Jones, clean up
this apartment.

01:14:38.909 --> 01:14:40.476
-All right, you, get in there.
-Wait.

01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:41.825
What happened
with the syringe?

01:14:41.868 --> 01:14:43.130
It was water.

01:14:49.528 --> 01:14:50.921
You guys going
to the hospital too?

01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:56.883
Gentlemen, this is
your captain speaking.

01:14:56.927 --> 01:14:58.363
This ain't a free ride.

01:14:58.406 --> 01:15:00.147
We need some intel
from y'all.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:03.020
Now, all we know
about this bug

01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:04.717
is that it's a cousin
of mad cow,

01:15:04.761 --> 01:15:06.980
but we have no idea
how it's transmitted.

01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:07.981
Any ideas?

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:11.332
Yuri, think back.

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:13.552
When do you think
you were exposed?

01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:14.597
Yeah, okay, uh...

01:15:19.471 --> 01:15:21.255
It wasn't at Gene's,
I had the headache

01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:23.388
-before then.
-Right, had to be.

01:15:24.781 --> 01:15:26.173
Fuck, okay.

01:15:28.306 --> 01:15:31.265
It must have been at Jake's
when he was dying.

01:15:31.309 --> 01:15:32.092
Hey.

01:15:33.964 --> 01:15:35.531
I think I touched some puke.

01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:37.620
Did you have a cut
on your hand?

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:40.100
No, I must have, must have...

01:15:42.929 --> 01:15:44.017
Eaten it?

01:15:44.061 --> 01:15:45.192
Yeah.

01:15:45.236 --> 01:15:47.151
Two and a half, three days.

01:15:47.194 --> 01:15:49.022
Timeline makes sense.

01:15:49.066 --> 01:15:50.415
Vomit transmission.

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:51.895
-No.
-What?

01:15:53.853 --> 01:15:56.595
We looked at vomit transmission
and it didn't pan out.

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:58.728
-Charles!
-Nick?

01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:01.208
Thanks to the graciousness
of the NYPD,

01:16:01.252 --> 01:16:03.428
your friends from True Healing
are back there.

01:16:03.471 --> 01:16:04.647
The more they cooperate with us,

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.474
the better they'll do
with the judge.

01:16:06.518 --> 01:16:08.041
I'm not saying anything.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.785
Charles.

01:16:12.829 --> 01:16:14.352
-Hey, Charles?
-Yuri?

01:16:14.395 --> 01:16:15.788
-Tell me what you know.
-No, Yuri.

01:16:15.832 --> 01:16:16.920
-Yuri.
-I'm gonna infect you.

01:16:16.963 --> 01:16:18.356
-Yuri, please!
-I'm gonna infect you!

01:16:18.399 --> 01:16:20.097
I don't know anything, okay?
It's Nick, Nick knows!

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.533
If you say one more word,
Charles,

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.666
I swear I will kill you.

01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:25.624
He can't do anything
to you right now.

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.495
He won't hurt you,
don't be afraid of him.

01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:29.454
Charles, I took you in.

01:16:29.497 --> 01:16:31.282
-I gave you a career.
-Don't listen to him,

01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:32.675
he's manipulating you.

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:34.590
You could help us right now.
You could stop this.

01:16:36.766 --> 01:16:38.768
We were monitoring
the disease.

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:40.596
Oh, you are dead!

01:16:40.639 --> 01:16:42.162
-Shut up.
-You fucking little snitch!

01:16:42.206 --> 01:16:43.468
Shut up, shut up!

01:16:50.388 --> 01:16:52.782
We've been tracking this thing

01:16:52.825 --> 01:16:55.349
ever since it broke in Brazil.

01:16:55.393 --> 01:16:57.177
We think the first case
was in a farmer

01:16:57.221 --> 01:16:58.918
outside of Saão Paulo.

01:16:58.962 --> 01:17:01.312
-No, Charles...
-Then we got word

01:17:01.355 --> 01:17:02.661
that it came to New York.

01:17:03.923 --> 01:17:05.795
So Nick made us relocate here.

01:17:09.015 --> 01:17:12.105
I could never figure out
the transmission.

01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:14.847
But it wasn't always
spread through the vomit.

01:17:14.891 --> 01:17:18.329
Because the first
two cases in New York,

01:17:18.372 --> 01:17:21.767
Abe and Chris,
lived in different boroughs

01:17:21.811 --> 01:17:23.682
and didn't know each other.

01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:26.163
But if you didn't know
how it was transmitted,

01:17:26.206 --> 01:17:28.513
how did you know
who to interview?

01:17:28.556 --> 01:17:29.949
I would crunch the data.

01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:31.995
Nick would decide
who we should follow.

01:17:32.038 --> 01:17:33.779
Nick, how did you decide?

01:17:36.173 --> 01:17:37.914
You're such
a fucking piece of shit.

01:17:37.957 --> 01:17:39.698
Charles, hope you
didn't get hung up

01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:41.352
on this vomit question.

01:17:41.395 --> 01:17:43.702
You know, it's fully possible
that Yuri was exposed

01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.095
when he touched the vomit,

01:17:45.138 --> 01:17:47.967
but these other guys,
the ones before,

01:17:48.011 --> 01:17:49.534
they could've had
a totally different

01:17:49.577 --> 01:17:52.145
ingestion exposure, like...

01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:54.104
maybe they ate
at the same restaurant.

01:17:55.235 --> 01:17:56.280
The same restaurant.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.457
Chris worked at MK's restaurant.

01:18:00.632 --> 01:18:02.242
That's right.

01:18:02.286 --> 01:18:04.854
Chris Pondorf worked
at the Swan Diner.

01:18:04.897 --> 01:18:06.725
It's possible that Abe
came out from Queens

01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:08.335
to eat there.

01:18:08.379 --> 01:18:10.468
Yeah, Jake ate there too!

01:18:10.511 --> 01:18:12.688
I saw an interview
that he had with MK there.

01:18:13.776 --> 01:18:15.212
That must be it.

01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:16.735
It's a lead.

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:19.564
Yuri, can we stop by there
on the way to the hospital?

01:18:19.607 --> 01:18:21.435
If we can figure out
this transmission,

01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:23.263
it might give us a clue
for your treatment.

01:18:23.307 --> 01:18:24.569
Yeah, let's do it.

01:18:35.188 --> 01:18:37.364
All right, you're on
the front lines of this thing.

01:18:37.408 --> 01:18:38.322
Put this on.

01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:52.118
Can I help you?

01:18:52.162 --> 01:18:54.468
Yeah, Tom Atkins, CDC.

01:18:54.512 --> 01:18:56.079
We have reason to believe
that this restaurant

01:18:56.122 --> 01:18:58.690
might be a reservoir
for a new disease.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.257
Are you talking about
what Chris had?

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.172
Correct, Chris Pondorf.

01:19:02.215 --> 01:19:04.565
Do you know of anyone else
who got sick after eating here?

01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:07.046
Uh, no, I don't think so.

01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:18.754
This guy.

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:21.321
Did he come here?

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:23.759
I never saw him.

01:19:23.802 --> 01:19:25.456
Could ask MK.

01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:27.588
She's the other
lead server here.

01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:29.503
She also knew Chris
better than I did.

01:19:29.547 --> 01:19:31.070
Wait, how much better?

01:19:31.114 --> 01:19:32.811
They got together
outside of work sometimes.

01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:33.725
Excuse me.

01:19:35.422 --> 01:19:36.380
Thank you.

01:19:40.123 --> 01:19:41.733
-What?
-Atkins, is it possible

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:43.387
for somebody
to have this disease

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:44.562
and not die from it?

01:19:46.259 --> 01:19:50.350
Uh, yeah,
an asymptomatic carrier.

01:19:50.394 --> 01:19:51.830
I don't think it came from here.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.707
Come on, MK, pick up.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.283
Hello?

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:13.199
Hey, it's MK's friend Yuri,
is she here?

01:20:13.243 --> 01:20:15.158
-No, she's out.
-Dammit!

01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:19.902
Um, can I talk
to you for a minute?

01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:20.816
It's serious.

01:20:24.123 --> 01:20:27.039
Hey, can I ask you
a couple questions about MK?

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:28.693
What is this about?

01:20:28.736 --> 01:20:31.609
Have you ever seen
this guy before?

01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:33.785
Yeah, he works for
that True Healing company,

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.352
he's been here a few times.

01:20:35.395 --> 01:20:38.964
Fuck! Um, do you think
he ever had sex with MK?

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:43.621
I mean, probably,
the door was closed,

01:20:43.664 --> 01:20:45.710
but I think so.

01:20:45.753 --> 01:20:47.364
-I'm sorry.
-No, no, no, it's not that,

01:20:47.407 --> 01:20:50.236
it's--here, look,
have you seen this guy before?

01:20:51.716 --> 01:20:53.413
Yeah, I went out
with her last week

01:20:53.457 --> 01:20:54.632
and she went home with him.

01:20:54.675 --> 01:20:55.502
Fuck!

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.504
Fuck.

01:20:57.548 --> 01:20:59.898
Um, okay, listen.

01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:02.988
MK has a deadly new disease,
all right?

01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:04.511
And she gave it
to those guys,

01:21:04.555 --> 01:21:05.861
and other guys
around the city,

01:21:05.904 --> 01:21:07.732
and now I have it, all right?

01:21:07.775 --> 01:21:09.603
-I need to get a hold of her.
-What?

01:21:09.647 --> 01:21:11.257
Look, the first guy
I showed you,

01:21:11.301 --> 01:21:12.998
he died from the disease, okay?

01:21:13.042 --> 01:21:14.478
The second guy's
in critical condition

01:21:14.521 --> 01:21:16.132
in the hospital,
now I have it,

01:21:16.175 --> 01:21:18.830
I need to get a hold of her,
I need to contact her.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.179
She won't answer
my phone calls,

01:21:20.223 --> 01:21:21.398
can you call her for me?

01:21:21.441 --> 01:21:23.269
-Please, please?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:21:30.537 --> 01:21:33.627
-Hello?
-Hey, MK, what are you up to?

01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:35.368
Uh, not much.

01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:37.370
I met this guy at the bar.

01:21:37.414 --> 01:21:39.372
Oh, are you busy?

01:21:39.416 --> 01:21:41.244
When are you coming home?

01:21:41.287 --> 01:21:45.944
Uh, I think we're gonna
go over to his place.

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:49.078
Um, can I have his address,
please?

01:21:49.121 --> 01:21:50.296
Why?

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.298
You know, sometimes
I worry about you.

01:21:52.342 --> 01:21:54.648
Oh, that's sweet, hold on.

01:21:54.692 --> 01:21:55.911
What's your address?

01:21:59.088 --> 01:22:02.526
It's 180 Lexington Ave.,
apartment 4B.

01:22:02.569 --> 01:22:05.921
180 Lexington Avenue,
apartment 4B.

01:22:05.964 --> 01:22:07.748
Okay, got it.

01:22:07.792 --> 01:22:10.577
Okay. I'll see you later, Alisa.

01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:11.535
Okay.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.667
Thank you.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:19.282
A sexually transmitted
prion disease.

01:22:19.325 --> 01:22:20.587
I'll be damned.

01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:39.258
Well, guess I don't need
this thing anymore.

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:43.959
-Whoo!
-Fuck!

01:22:44.002 --> 01:22:46.483
I got some extra strength
aspirin if you need it.

01:22:46.526 --> 01:22:50.400
No, I just can't believe
she fucked them all.

01:22:50.443 --> 01:22:52.706
I fucked her
without a condom on.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:53.620
Fucking idiot.

01:22:53.664 --> 01:22:56.145
Don't beat yourself up too hard.

01:22:56.188 --> 01:22:58.538
Things just got a whole lot
better for you, bud.

01:22:58.582 --> 01:22:59.800
Think about it.

01:22:59.844 --> 01:23:02.890
If she has it,
isn't showing any symptoms?

01:23:02.934 --> 01:23:04.762
That means the disease
doesn't kill everyone.

01:23:07.156 --> 01:23:09.375
Right, right, yeah!

01:23:11.377 --> 01:23:12.248
Go faster.

01:23:16.252 --> 01:23:18.210
Come on in, don't be shy.

01:23:19.472 --> 01:23:21.909
-Thanks, I'm not.
-I know.

01:23:21.953 --> 01:23:23.955
This is it,
my humble abode.

01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:26.218
It's cute.

01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:27.437
How long have you been here?

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.526
About two years.

01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:31.310
Can I use your bathroom
real quick?

01:23:31.354 --> 01:23:34.574
Yeah, it's uh--
it's right through there.

01:23:39.231 --> 01:23:41.059
I don't understand
how she could have it

01:23:41.103 --> 01:23:42.408
and not have symptoms.

01:23:42.452 --> 01:23:43.931
We've already seen
that the immune system

01:23:43.975 --> 01:23:45.759
doesn't activate
for this disease,

01:23:45.803 --> 01:23:49.676
and it's very possible
that the disease prions

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.244
are in her body lying dormant.

01:23:52.288 --> 01:23:55.073
They're just not triggering
the way they do in others.

01:23:55.117 --> 01:23:57.162
She must have noticed that
everybody she was sleeping with

01:23:57.206 --> 01:23:58.598
like dies.

01:24:00.122 --> 01:24:01.514
Maybe.

01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:04.474
Denial is a powerful thing.

01:24:04.517 --> 01:24:07.259
In the 1900s there was
a cook named Mary Mallon,

01:24:07.303 --> 01:24:08.521
Typhoid Mary.

01:24:08.565 --> 01:24:10.610
Asymptomatic carrier
of typhoid fever.

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.787
She used to cook
for these families

01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:16.616
and of course inevitably,
they'd all get sick,

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.315
but she denied it
to the very end.

01:24:19.358 --> 01:24:20.707
She didn't want it to be true.

01:24:28.367 --> 01:24:30.021
Oh, wow.

01:25:16.546 --> 01:25:18.504
If she is
an asymptomatic carrier,

01:25:18.548 --> 01:25:20.506
that means that there's
something in her DNA

01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:22.160
or in her blood
that makes her resistant,

01:25:22.204 --> 01:25:24.249
and if we can get
a sample from her,

01:25:24.293 --> 01:25:28.253
we can isolate that resistance
and use it with you.

01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:29.863
It's your best shot, bud.

01:25:29.907 --> 01:25:32.083
No, no, no, if she sees that,
she might run.

01:25:34.346 --> 01:25:36.087
We'll keep it in here
until she's agreed.

01:25:37.349 --> 01:25:38.698
Yeah, okay.

01:25:52.408 --> 01:25:53.800
Are you expecting someone?

01:25:53.844 --> 01:25:55.541
What? No.

01:26:05.203 --> 01:26:05.986
Yeah?

01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:07.466
Uh, Roger?

01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:08.772
Yeah? Who is this?

01:26:08.815 --> 01:26:09.816
It's Yuri from the bar.

01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.383
I need to talk to MK.

01:26:11.427 --> 01:26:13.864
Dude, she went home with me.

01:26:13.907 --> 01:26:16.867
Yeah, I know, man, listen,
all right, she's dangerous.

01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:19.217
Dude, get outta here,
all right, man?

01:26:19.261 --> 01:26:20.740
No, no, no,
let me in, man!

01:26:20.784 --> 01:26:23.221
Jesus, what the fuck
is this guy's problem?

01:26:23.265 --> 01:26:25.180
I don't know,
he must be real jealous.

01:26:25.223 --> 01:26:26.181
I don't give a shit.

01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:28.487
I want you so bad.

01:26:30.837 --> 01:26:33.579
-Who is it?
-Uh, delivery.

01:27:21.366 --> 01:27:23.586
Centers for Disease Control,
open the door.

01:27:25.805 --> 01:27:27.067
Tom Atkins, CDC.

01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:30.636
Were you having sex with her?

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.855
Yeah.

01:27:31.898 --> 01:27:33.335
Where is she?

01:27:33.378 --> 01:27:35.075
Dude, what the fuck you doing,
this is my apartment!

01:27:35.119 --> 01:27:36.076
What is this?

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.469
Get the hell out of here!

01:27:37.513 --> 01:27:39.166
Listen to me,
all right, it's you!

01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:40.690
You have the disease.

01:27:40.733 --> 01:27:42.169
You're the one
that's been spreading it.

01:27:42.213 --> 01:27:43.649
-Is this for real?
-Shut up, Yuri,

01:27:43.693 --> 01:27:45.390
-that isn't funny.
-I'm serious, all right?

01:27:45.434 --> 01:27:47.262
You had sex with Jake,
didn't you?

01:27:47.305 --> 01:27:49.351
This is so stupid!

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:51.135
We aren't boyfriend
and girlfriend, you know,

01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:53.006
-sorry.
-I know that, all right?

01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:54.573
It's about the disease, okay?

01:27:54.617 --> 01:27:56.314
Either you slept with him
or you didn't.

01:27:56.358 --> 01:27:58.055
It is none of your business.

01:27:58.098 --> 01:28:00.318
Uh, unfortunately, it is.

01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:01.493
Who is this guy?

01:28:01.537 --> 01:28:02.842
What does he look like?

01:28:02.886 --> 01:28:03.974
He's tracking the disease.

01:28:04.017 --> 01:28:06.150
Well, you know what?

01:28:06.193 --> 01:28:07.543
Sorry, you're looking
in the wrong place,

01:28:07.586 --> 01:28:09.545
-I'm not sick.
-I understand that,

01:28:09.588 --> 01:28:11.286
but there's a very
real possibility

01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:12.722
that you're carrying
this disease

01:28:12.765 --> 01:28:14.245
without showing
any symptoms.

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:16.639
-What the fuck.
-That's crazy,

01:28:16.682 --> 01:28:18.118
that's not possible.

01:28:18.162 --> 01:28:19.294
Yes it is.

01:28:19.337 --> 01:28:20.251
He's right.

01:28:28.781 --> 01:28:29.826
MK, it's...

01:28:31.958 --> 01:28:33.308
MK, you must have known.

01:28:34.439 --> 01:28:37.137
Abe? Chris? Jake?

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.575
They all died.

01:28:39.618 --> 01:28:41.098
What?

01:28:41.141 --> 01:28:42.882
I didn't have sex with Jake.

01:28:49.759 --> 01:28:54.198
No, no, there's something
between both of you.

01:28:54.241 --> 01:28:56.287
That first day in the park.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.289
You weren't just friends,
all right?

01:29:00.291 --> 01:29:02.249
I pretended not to notice
but it was there.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:06.210
I didn't have sex with Jake.

01:29:07.646 --> 01:29:09.648
Yeah, but did you do
something else with him?

01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:18.701
Right, right,
you lied to me.

01:29:18.744 --> 01:29:20.137
You said you were just friends.

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.399
We were just friends.

01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:24.402
I didn't want to upset you.

01:29:24.446 --> 01:29:27.971
Upset? Goddammit, I fucking
loved you, all right?

01:29:28.014 --> 01:29:30.060
-I trusted you.
-You didn't love me!

01:29:30.103 --> 01:29:32.454
You just wanted to screw me
until you got sick of it

01:29:32.497 --> 01:29:33.716
and then be done with me.

01:29:35.544 --> 01:29:36.806
Sorry to interrupt,

01:29:36.849 --> 01:29:38.895
but we need to get
a blood sample from you.

01:29:38.938 --> 01:29:40.244
Why?

01:29:40.287 --> 01:29:41.854
To test it to determine
if in fact

01:29:41.898 --> 01:29:43.552
you're carrying the disease.

01:29:43.595 --> 01:29:46.119
It could help us find a cure.

01:29:46.163 --> 01:29:48.426
Well, what if the test shows
that I have the disease?

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:49.906
What's gonna happen to me?

01:29:49.949 --> 01:29:51.516
Some more tests.

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.562
Give some more blood,
no one's gonna hurt you.

01:29:53.605 --> 01:29:54.998
Look, I don't blame you,
all right?

01:29:56.216 --> 01:29:57.217
It was an accident.

01:29:59.481 --> 01:30:01.091
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:30:15.671 --> 01:30:17.281
So what does this disease do?

01:30:18.543 --> 01:30:21.894
Um, you have trouble
sleeping...

01:30:22.895 --> 01:30:25.245
get bad headaches...

01:30:25.289 --> 01:30:27.160
memory loss, hallucinations.

01:30:28.031 --> 01:30:29.728
Then what happens?

01:30:29.772 --> 01:30:34.646
You get real nauseous
and you throw up a lot.

01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:36.256
Then you get
a bad seizure.

01:30:38.171 --> 01:30:39.564
Until you stop breathing.

01:30:43.307 --> 01:30:44.656
What's she doing in there?

01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:49.139
I didn't hear her flush.

01:30:51.533 --> 01:30:52.403
MK.

01:30:54.405 --> 01:30:55.319
Hey, MK.

01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:01.064
Shit! She went
out the window.

01:31:24.783 --> 01:31:26.524
MK, stop!

01:31:30.789 --> 01:31:32.269
Don't run away from me!

01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:37.796
I'm fucking dying!

01:31:39.581 --> 01:31:40.538
Stop!

01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:19.621
Yuri.

01:32:59.965 --> 01:33:01.010
Hang in there, bud.

01:33:22.161 --> 01:33:23.510
One, two, three.

01:33:38.438 --> 01:33:41.093
Hold him down.

01:33:41.137 --> 01:33:42.268
Easy, easy!

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.502
Nurse?

01:33:58.545 --> 01:34:00.547
We need to get the blood
out of this locket ASAP.

01:34:48.073 --> 01:34:49.727
Yuri, you're up!

01:34:50.859 --> 01:34:52.687
Easy, easy.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.257
You are very lucky.

01:34:58.301 --> 01:35:01.739
There've been over
20 cases across the city

01:35:01.783 --> 01:35:05.525
