I'm John Oliver, thank you

Let's get right into it,
there's a lot to get through,

00:48.767 --> 00:51.567

with New Zealand,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.600
You are nothing.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.734
The ruling party of New Zealand
has been at the center

01:01.734 --> 01:04.033
of a ridiculous court case
this week.

01:04.033 --> 01:05.500
- The High Court in Wellington
has today been filled

01:05.500 --> 01:08.233
with the sounds of bad boy
American rapper Eminem.

01:08.233 --> 01:10.266
The hip-hop heavyweight's
accused the National Party

01:10.266 --> 01:11.700
of ripping off
one of his biggest hits

01:11.700 --> 01:13.400
for an election campaign ad.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.867
- Here's
Eminem's "Lose Yourself"...

01:14.867 --> 01:16.900
- ♪ If you had... ♪

01:16.900 --> 01:19.033

01:19.033 --> 01:21.100
[dramatic orchestral beat]

01:21.100 --> 01:23.533
- Yes, as we have mentioned
before on this show,

01:23.533 --> 01:25.333
New Zealand's National Party
has been accused

01:25.333 --> 01:26.433
of ripping off Eminem,

01:26.433 --> 01:28.333
or as they call him, "Eemineem."

01:28.333 --> 01:30.800
And it is unquestionably

01:30.800 --> 01:32.300
the lamest rap beef

01:32.300 --> 01:35.767
since Lil Wayne's five-year feud
with William H. Macy.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.800
Now--now,
the National Party's defense

01:37.800 --> 01:41.633
is that they didn't use Eminem--
they used a different song.

01:41.633 --> 01:42.900
- It was revealed in court

01:42.900 --> 01:45.333
the name of the song
used by National

01:45.333 --> 01:47.166
was "Eminem Esque."

01:47.166 --> 01:48.767
- It's true.

01:48.767 --> 01:53.467
The track they used is
literally called "Eminem Esque,"

01:53.467 --> 01:55.867
and if you are going to rip off
someone else's work,

01:55.867 --> 01:57.100
maybe don't include the name

01:57.100 --> 01:59.100
of the person
you're ripping off.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.600

02:00.600 --> 02:03.700

You know, some define comedy
as tragedy plus time,

02:57.700 --> 02:59.734
but for me,
the purest definition

02:59.734 --> 03:03.533
is a middle-aged Kiwi in a robe
playing Eminem's "Lose Yourself"

03:03.533 --> 03:06.867
to a completely silent
and motionless court room.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.467
And perhaps my favorite thing
about that

03:08.467 --> 03:10.400
is this woman's reaction.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.066
She's silently questioning
every life choice

03:13.066 --> 03:14.800
that led her to this moment

03:14.800 --> 03:18.367
and hopefully not regretting
a single one of them.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.200
But it gets even better,
because that lawyer

03:20.200 --> 03:21.533
for Eminem's music publisher

03:21.533 --> 03:23.600
offered his own
deep interpretation

03:23.600 --> 03:24.967
of the song.

03:24.967 --> 03:26.734
- The idea
of losing yourself in the moment

03:26.734 --> 03:29.000
and not missing opportunities
in life

03:29.000 --> 03:31.800
is closely associated
with the guitar rift

03:31.800 --> 03:33.433
at the beginning of the song

03:33.433 --> 03:35.934
and is why the song appeals
to both the public

03:35.934 --> 03:38.166
and those who wish
to influence the public

03:38.166 --> 03:39.767
by using it in advertising.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.467
- I now want to
hear him describe

03:41.467 --> 03:44.533
every single iconic rap song
in history.

03:44.533 --> 03:47.834
"When the artist Juvenile uses
his incessant drum pattern,

03:47.834 --> 03:50.333
"it eloquently underlines
his central thesis

03:50.333 --> 03:51.900
"that the young woman in
question appears

03:51.900 --> 03:53.533
"pleasing to the eye
and that he,

03:53.533 --> 03:55.500
"the singer,
would very much appreciate it

03:55.500 --> 03:59.667
if she were to back,
if you will, that ass up."

03:59.667 --> 04:02.834
And look,
there is nothing I want more

04:02.834 --> 04:05.533
than to spend
the whole rest of this show

04:05.533 --> 04:09.300
breaking down what is projected
to be a six-day court case,

04:09.300 --> 04:11.233
but sadly, we must move on

04:11.233 --> 04:13.533
to the U.S. House
of Representatives,

04:13.533 --> 04:17.934
basically 434 dorks
and Virginia's Don Beyer.

04:17.934 --> 04:21.367
The guy is a fucking baller.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.600
Look at him.
He knows.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.400
This week,
the House made big news.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.433
- Our top story tonight:

04:27.433 --> 04:28.834
the House has passed a bill

04:28.834 --> 04:31.433
to repeal and replace Obamacare.

04:31.433 --> 04:35.700
The vote was tight--
217 for and 213 against.

04:35.700 --> 04:36.800
- Yes, in a shock move,

04:36.800 --> 04:38.133
the U.S. House passed

04:38.133 --> 04:39.867
the American Health Care Act
by a whisker.

04:39.867 --> 04:41.233
They were so desperate
for votes,

04:41.233 --> 04:44.133
Jason Chaffetz flew in
following foot surgery

04:44.133 --> 04:46.700
with his leg up
on a jaunty scooter,

04:46.700 --> 04:50.400
zipping around
like a corgi with hip dysplasia.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.633
The real shock, though,

04:51.633 --> 04:53.166
was how quickly
all this went down.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.500
Changes were still being made
to the bill this week,

04:55.500 --> 04:57.266
and the CBO, which estimates

04:57.266 --> 04:59.333
the cost and impacts
of proposed laws,

04:59.333 --> 05:01.767
hadn't even had time
to score the final version,

05:01.767 --> 05:04.066
and multiple members of Congress
admitted

05:04.066 --> 05:06.567
they hadn't even read
the whole thing.

05:06.567 --> 05:10.200
- Did you read this entire bill?

05:10.200 --> 05:11.367
- Uh, yeah.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.333
I-I wouldn't say every--
uh, uh, yes,

05:13.333 --> 05:15.000
I turned through every page.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.734
As to whether or not
I-I got through

05:16.734 --> 05:18.800
some of the details
in some of the pages,

05:18.800 --> 05:22.100
no, uh, but yes, I attempted
to read the entire bill.

05:22.100 --> 05:25.333
- Wait,
you turned through every page?

05:25.333 --> 05:26.934
That's not how you read a bill.

05:26.934 --> 05:29.767
That's how you check a bill
for spiders.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.867
"Oh, I can't say
whether this bill will cause

05:31.867 --> 05:33.734
millions to lose insurance,
but it does have

05:33.734 --> 05:37.233
the Mark Sanford
'no spiders' guarantee."

05:37.233 --> 05:38.533
Now, in fairness,

05:38.533 --> 05:40.266
as Congressman Chris Collins
pointed out,

05:40.266 --> 05:42.567
it is not essential
that representatives read

05:42.567 --> 05:45.133
every single word of a bill.

05:45.133 --> 05:46.700
- We rely on our staff,

05:46.700 --> 05:48.533
and we rely on our committees,

05:48.533 --> 05:50.667
and I'm comfortable
that I understand this bill

05:50.667 --> 05:52.233
in its entirety, Wolf,

05:52.233 --> 05:54.467
without poring
through every word,

05:54.467 --> 05:56.967
and, uh,
I'm just being quite honest.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.333
That's the way it is.

05:58.333 --> 05:59.867
- Now, you know what,
that is actually fair.

05:59.867 --> 06:02.400
What really matters
is that politicians like Collins

06:02.400 --> 06:05.367
fully understand
the contents of this bill,

06:05.367 --> 06:08.133
but when the "Buffalo News"
asked him if he knew

06:08.133 --> 06:09.600
that it would cut funding
for a program

06:09.600 --> 06:12.066
providing insurance
to over 600,000

06:12.066 --> 06:14.000
low- and middle-income people
in New York state,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.600
including over 19,000 people

06:16.600 --> 06:18.767
in two counties
that he represents parts of,

06:18.767 --> 06:20.367
he indicated that he didn't

06:20.367 --> 06:22.700
and said, "Explain that to me,"

06:22.700 --> 06:26.400
and okay, I can explain that
to you right now:

06:26.400 --> 06:28.734
this bill could cause
many of your constituents

06:28.734 --> 06:30.967
to get thrown into
an individual marketplace

06:30.967 --> 06:33.400
they cannot afford,
and when they realize that,

06:33.400 --> 06:35.633
they are going to be furious
with you.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.467
Essentially, you fucked up.

06:37.467 --> 06:41.033
In fact, here is the amount that
you fucked up shown graphically,

06:41.033 --> 06:43.834
here is you fucking up
shown in a scatter plot,

06:43.834 --> 06:46.033
and here is
a Precious Moments figurine

06:46.033 --> 06:48.934
explaining exactly
what you just did.

06:48.934 --> 06:51.600
Have I explained this
clearly enough?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.900
Maybe ask your staff
to read what she's holding

06:53.900 --> 06:56.100
and tell you what it means.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.967
Now--now, we've talked
multiple times on this show

06:57.967 --> 06:59.367
about everything that was bad

06:59.367 --> 07:01.300
with the previous version
of this bill,

07:01.300 --> 07:03.300
a bill, incidentally,
that was estimated to result

07:03.300 --> 07:06.166
in 24 million fewer Americans

07:06.166 --> 07:07.967
having insurance
after ten years,

07:07.967 --> 07:10.500
and the bill that passed
this week had all of the things

07:10.500 --> 07:12.066
that were bad
about the last one,

07:12.066 --> 07:14.567
with a particularly
unpleasant addition.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.633
- The Republican bill
would roll back

07:16.633 --> 07:18.600
the Affordable Care Act's
protections

07:18.600 --> 07:21.066
for patients
with pre-existing conditions.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.900
Health insurers would
still have to cover them,

07:23.900 --> 07:25.567
but the bill includes
a mechanism

07:25.567 --> 07:28.300
allowing insurance companies
to raise rates

07:28.300 --> 07:29.533
on those patients.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.100
- Yes, they took a bad thing

07:31.100 --> 07:33.066
and managed
to make it even worse.

07:33.066 --> 07:35.433
It's like watching Mariah
Carey's "Glitter" and saying,

07:35.433 --> 07:36.633
"You know what this needs?

07:36.633 --> 07:38.867
Jar Jar Binks."

07:38.867 --> 07:40.567
And look, look,

07:40.567 --> 07:42.900
Republicans are currently saying

07:42.900 --> 07:44.667
that no one
can be denied coverage

07:44.667 --> 07:46.533
for pre-existing conditions
under this bill,

07:46.533 --> 07:48.934
but the truth is,
if you have one

07:48.934 --> 07:50.333
and there is a gap
in your coverage

07:50.333 --> 07:51.533
for any reason,

07:51.533 --> 07:53.433
you could be charged a lot more,

07:53.433 --> 07:55.266
potentially so much more

07:55.266 --> 07:57.133
that coverage becomes
unaffordable.

07:57.133 --> 07:58.667
It's like if your daughter asks,

07:58.667 --> 08:00.166
"Can I have a cookie?"

08:00.166 --> 08:04.400
And you say, "Sure,
that'll be $1.5 billion, Katie.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.367
"You have not been denied
this cookie,

08:06.367 --> 08:08.166
"you still have full access
to it,

08:08.166 --> 08:10.166
"should you choose
to become successful enough

08:10.166 --> 08:11.467
"to be able to afford it.

08:11.467 --> 08:14.100
Now, get out of my sight."

08:14.100 --> 08:16.033
So this bill now heads
to the U.S. Senate,

08:16.033 --> 08:17.734
who are expected
to write their own version,

08:17.734 --> 08:20.166
and while it may be
slightly more moderate,

08:20.166 --> 08:22.066
that could really still amount
to basically

08:22.066 --> 08:24.600
cutting a shit sandwich in half.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.433
And if any bill gets
to President Trump's desk,

08:27.433 --> 08:29.834
we already know he will sign it.

08:29.834 --> 08:33.166
This guy would sign a live snake
as long as it had

08:33.166 --> 08:35.600
"Obamacare repeal"
written on it.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.166
So it is dangerous to assume

08:37.166 --> 08:38.700
that this bill will die
on its own.

08:38.700 --> 08:42.000
Your senators are incredibly
important right now,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.834
and they're going
to recess soon,

08:43.834 --> 08:46.734
so you need to let them know
how you feel about this.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.900
You only get one shot at this,
one opportunity,

08:50.900 --> 08:53.200
and I know the perfect song
to pump you up,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.834
but as New Zealand has shown me,

08:54.834 --> 08:56.567
we cannot legally play it.

08:56.567 --> 08:59.166
What we can play you
is "8 Mile Thug,"

08:59.166 --> 09:01.533
an actual
"Eminem Esque"-esque song

09:01.533 --> 09:02.867
that we found.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.266

09:27.367 --> 09:29.333
That's, like, the fourth time.
We get the point.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.000
- No, you don't--
no, you don't get the point.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.900
You're the last person
on the face of the Earth

09:32.900 --> 09:33.900
that appears to get the point.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.000
- Are you kidding me?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.467
I need to talk.
Hold on one second.

09:36.467 --> 09:37.834
- Well, I-I'd like you to answer
the question, though.

09:37.834 --> 09:38.834
Because--
- Yes, it's silly.

09:38.834 --> 09:39.834
I'm answering.

09:39.834 --> 09:40.834
- The horse is on the street.

09:40.834 --> 09:42.033
- But it's not what you said.

09:42.033 --> 09:43.967
- No, it is what I--
it is what I said!

09:43.967 --> 09:45.166
You don't have to be so snotty.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.200
I was about to say.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.600
You didn't let me get it out.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.967
You don't have to be so rude.
- Well, no, I--

09:49.967 --> 09:50.967
- Let me say this.
- Excuse me, excuse--

09:50.967 --> 09:52.300
- Let me say this, okay?

09:52.300 --> 09:54.467
Because it means nothing
coming from you, okay?

09:54.467 --> 09:55.700
You're a Democrat.
- Excuse me?

09:55.700 --> 09:57.166
You're being chauvinistic
right now.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.467
- [gasps] Oh, am I really?
- And you need to stop.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.467
- Oh.
- All right?

09:59.467 --> 10:00.467
- Stop the apologizing!

10:00.467 --> 10:02.033
- I'm not apologizing--

10:02.033 --> 10:04.333
- You're apologizing, like,
"Who would like politics?"

10:04.333 --> 10:05.767
I haven't seen
any evidence of that.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.100
- Did you want me to talk?
- Well, no, I'm just--

10:07.100 --> 10:08.867
- I can go back
to the south of France.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.066
- You wanted
to get your cheap shot in,

10:10.066 --> 10:11.533
so you got your cheap shot in.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.266
- It's not.
- I wouldn't be quite so smug.

10:13.266 --> 10:14.834
- What's wrong with you?

10:14.834 --> 10:16.600
What is wrong with you?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.100
- Bring it down,
and relax a little bit.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.200
- Stop.
- You're mad at me?

10:19.200 --> 10:20.533
- A little bit, yeah.

10:20.533 --> 10:22.100
- Oh, just shut up.
- No, I'm just wondering.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.667
- All right, Mika.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.300
- So that they can say anything
they want and answer questions.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.300
- Mika!

10:26.300 --> 10:27.667
both: Mm.

10:27.667 --> 10:28.667

The Internet is
an incredible place.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.867
And tonight,
we need to talk about an issue

10:59.867 --> 11:02.300
that is impacting it:
net neutrality.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.300
If that term rings a bell,

11:03.300 --> 11:04.333
we actually talked about it

11:04.333 --> 11:05.867
in our fifth-ever episode

11:05.867 --> 11:07.166
three years ago,

11:07.166 --> 11:09.900
a piece that got
a weird amount of attention.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.834
- "Last Week Tonight
With John Oliver"

11:11.834 --> 11:13.867
has languished
in relative obscurity

11:13.867 --> 11:16.767
since its debut in April,
but this week,

11:16.767 --> 11:20.567
an Oliver diatribe
about net neutrality went viral.

11:20.567 --> 11:23.166
- Hey!
Fuck you, lady!

11:23.166 --> 11:26.233
I didn't languish
in relative obscurity.

11:26.233 --> 11:29.367
I thrived in relative obscurity!

11:29.367 --> 11:32.600
Relative obscurity
is my middle name.

11:32.600 --> 11:36.100
But incredibly,
being negged by WGBH Boston

11:36.100 --> 11:37.700
was not the weirdest bit
of attention

11:37.700 --> 11:39.200
that that segment attracted.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.867
That, without a doubt,
would be this.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.633
[dramatic music]

11:43.633 --> 11:46.767
- All right! It's comedian
John Oliver in New York.

11:46.767 --> 11:50.567
- They did a big piece
on net neutrality and the FCC,

11:50.567 --> 11:53.100
and he directed everybody
to go to the FCC website

11:53.100 --> 11:54.633
and leave,
like, hateful comments.

11:54.633 --> 11:57.066
- And it turns out
it totally worked!

11:57.066 --> 11:59.166
The FCC's website crashed!

11:59.166 --> 12:00.567
You did it, John!

12:05.100 --> 12:06.333
Now--yeah.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.533
I will admit, that is

12:07.533 --> 12:09.767
a quintessentially
British excuse.

12:09.767 --> 12:11.800
"You cannot possibly
hold me responsible

12:11.800 --> 12:13.934

12:15.233 --> 12:16.533
"I said good day to you.

12:16.533 --> 12:18.667
Good day, sir!"

12:18.667 --> 12:21.333
Now--now, the reason
for our segment three years ago

12:21.333 --> 12:22.934
was that the future
of net neutrality

12:22.934 --> 12:24.600
was in question,
and to their credit,

12:24.600 --> 12:27.400
the FCC took steps
to safeguard it,

12:27.400 --> 12:29.667
and if you're wondering why
I'm even bringing up a problem

12:29.667 --> 12:31.133
that was seemingly solved,

12:31.133 --> 12:32.600
this is why.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.800
- The Trump administration today
announcing plans

12:34.800 --> 12:38.200
to roll back
Obama-era net neutrality rules

12:38.200 --> 12:39.400
on equal access.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.467
- Of course.

12:40.467 --> 12:41.834
It seems that the Trump era

12:41.834 --> 12:43.367
will basically control-Z

12:43.367 --> 12:45.600
everything that happened
on Obama's watch.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.033
I genuinely would not
be surprised if one night,

12:48.033 --> 12:50.867
Trump went on TV just to tell us
that he personally killed

12:50.867 --> 12:54.500
every Turkey
Obama ever pardoned.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.533
The--the--the point is, though,

12:56.533 --> 12:59.467
once again,
net neutrality is in trouble,

12:59.467 --> 13:01.900
and if you need a refresher
on what it involves,

13:01.900 --> 13:05.567
please let the star
of the 2007 viral smash video

13:05.567 --> 13:09.500
"Chocolate Rain"
explain it to you in 30 seconds.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.600
- Net neutrality is the idea
that your pipe to the Internet,

13:12.600 --> 13:15.433
whether that is
your cable Internet connection,

13:15.433 --> 13:18.734
your LGE wireless
Internet connection,

13:18.734 --> 13:22.500
however you are receiving
information via the Internet,

13:22.500 --> 13:24.633
that pipeline to the Internet
is not allowed

13:24.633 --> 13:26.600
to arbitrarily pick favorites

13:26.600 --> 13:28.900
in terms of the content
that you consume.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.867
For example,
if you like to use Google search

13:30.867 --> 13:33.233
and your roommate likes
to use Bing search,

13:33.233 --> 13:35.166
your Internet service provider
can't say,

13:35.166 --> 13:37.200
"Well, Bing is paying us
a lot of money,

13:37.200 --> 13:39.734
"so we're gonna slow down
Google and Yahoo

13:39.734 --> 13:42.033
"and their other
search engine competitors

13:42.033 --> 13:43.867
to make Bing load fast."

13:43.867 --> 13:45.166
- He's right,
although that's obviously

13:45.166 --> 13:46.500
just a hypothetical.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.066
There is clearly
no such search engine as Bing,

13:49.066 --> 13:52.266
or--or I don't--
maybe there is, I don't know.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.967
There's really only one way
to find out,

13:53.967 --> 13:55.266
and that's by Googling it,

13:55.266 --> 13:57.367
and that's kind of the point.

13:57.367 --> 14:02.300
But--but net neutrality is about
more than just speed.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.934
At its heart,
it is the principle

14:03.934 --> 14:07.567
that Internet service providers,
or ISPs like these guys,

14:07.567 --> 14:10.333
should not be able
to engage in any sort of fuckery

14:10.333 --> 14:13.166
that limits or manipulates
the choices you make online.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.367
It also helps ensure
a level playing field

14:15.367 --> 14:18.266
so that big companies
cannot undermine small companies

14:18.266 --> 14:20.367
before they can take off,
and without it,

14:20.367 --> 14:23.500
Ancestry.com could easily crush
my new site

14:23.500 --> 14:26.433
JustTellMe-
IfImRelatedToANazi.com.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.734
It's like Ancestry.com,

14:27.734 --> 14:30.533
except you get to skip
all the bullshit.

14:30.533 --> 14:33.133
Net neutrality
is objectively boring,

14:33.133 --> 14:35.800
and that used to work
to ISPs' advantage,

14:35.800 --> 14:38.066
but more people know
what it is now,

14:38.066 --> 14:39.533
which is why
some companies have started

14:39.533 --> 14:40.734
putting out statements

14:40.734 --> 14:42.000
trumpeting their support

14:42.000 --> 14:44.233
for a "free and open Internet."

14:44.233 --> 14:46.467
In fact,
Verizon even created a video

14:46.467 --> 14:49.200
to calm any concerns
that you might have.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.200
- Hey, what's up, everybody?

14:50.200 --> 14:51.467
Jeremy here with Craig Silliman,

14:51.467 --> 14:52.734
who is our general counsel

14:52.734 --> 14:54.567
and leads
our public policy group.

14:54.567 --> 14:55.934
Let's jump right into it.

14:55.934 --> 14:58.400
Is the FCC going to kill
what we know

14:58.400 --> 15:01.100
as the open Internet rules
or net neutrality?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.400
- The FCC is not talking about

15:02.400 --> 15:03.567
killing
the net neutrality rules,

15:03.567 --> 15:06.400
and in fact,
not we nor any other ISP

15:06.400 --> 15:09.000
are asking them
to kill the open Internet rules.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.500
All they're doing is looking
to put the open Internet rules

15:11.500 --> 15:14.400
in an enforceable way
on a different legal footing.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.166
- Now, that sounds reasonable,

15:16.166 --> 15:18.667
and why wouldn't you trust
the commitment to open access

15:18.667 --> 15:20.133
of a man sitting at a table

15:20.133 --> 15:22.767
literally blocking
an entire hallway?

15:22.767 --> 15:26.667
But--but while--but while
a different legal footing

15:26.667 --> 15:29.734
sounds pretty benign, it is not.

15:29.734 --> 15:31.400
And it is also
worth understanding

15:31.400 --> 15:34.166
how net neutrality landed
on its current legal footing,

15:34.166 --> 15:36.867
because it happens
to directly involve Verizon.

15:36.867 --> 15:38.000
So, let me explain,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.900
and unfortunately,
to do that,

15:39.900 --> 15:41.767
I have to introduce you
to two terms

15:41.767 --> 15:43.700
even more boring
than net neutrality,

15:43.700 --> 15:46.467
specifically
Title I and Title II

15:46.467 --> 15:49.000
of the Communications Act
of 1934,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.900
the equivalent
of chasing an Ambien

15:50.900 --> 15:52.967
with a shot of chloroform.

15:52.967 --> 15:56.166
But here is, very broadly,
what happened.

15:56.166 --> 15:57.800
Back in 2010,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.834
the FCC wrote
net neutrality rules

15:59.834 --> 16:02.033
governing ISPs,
which, at the time,

16:02.033 --> 16:04.867
were regulated
under the less strict Title I,

16:04.867 --> 16:06.166
and the companies found

16:06.166 --> 16:07.767
those net neutrality rules
inconvenient.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.367
In fact, Verizon successfully
sued the FCC,

16:11.367 --> 16:13.100
arguing that it didn't have
enough authority

16:13.100 --> 16:14.400
to enforce those rules,

16:14.400 --> 16:17.400
and the court ruled
that if the FCC did want

16:17.400 --> 16:19.734
strong, enforceable
net neutrality,

16:19.734 --> 16:22.567
their best option
would be to reclassify ISPs

16:22.567 --> 16:25.967
under Title II, which allows
for much stronger oversight,

16:25.967 --> 16:27.767
so the FCC did that,

16:27.767 --> 16:29.367
and the fact they did was huge.

16:29.367 --> 16:32.967
So when Verizon claims, "Hey,
we love the open Internet,

16:32.967 --> 16:36.066
but why don't we just put it
on a different legal footing,"

16:36.066 --> 16:39.300
it's basically OJ Simpson asking
why you won't let him hold

16:39.300 --> 16:41.533
any of your samurai swords.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.200
Come on, Juice.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.033
You know why.

16:46.033 --> 16:49.767
You of anyone should know why.

16:49.767 --> 16:53.467
And--and the ISPs now have
a powerful ally on their side,

16:53.467 --> 16:56.467
because Trump has appointed
a new head of the FCC,

16:56.467 --> 16:58.000
and it is this guy.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.367
- Ajit Pai is known
for being anti-regulation,

17:00.367 --> 17:01.567
pro-merger--

17:01.567 --> 17:02.567
last month, he said

17:02.567 --> 17:03.567
he wanted to, quote,

17:03.567 --> 17:04.934
"take a Weedwacker"

17:04.934 --> 17:06.400
to current FCC rules

17:06.400 --> 17:08.166
and predicted net neutrality's,

17:08.166 --> 17:09.967
quote, "days are numbered."

17:09.967 --> 17:10.967
- Wow, okay.

17:10.967 --> 17:11.967
"Days are numbered"

17:11.967 --> 17:13.266
and "take a weed whacker"

17:13.266 --> 17:15.433
are serial killer talk,

17:15.433 --> 17:16.834
so that is pretty ominous.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.333
When the code
of federal regulations

17:18.333 --> 17:19.834
looks out of its window
at night,

17:19.834 --> 17:22.900
there's just Ajit Pai,
standing silently,

17:22.900 --> 17:27.333
holding his weed whacker,
waiting for his chance.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.934
But the dangerous thing
about Pai

17:28.934 --> 17:32.500
is that he presents himself
as a fun, down-to-Earth nerd,

17:32.500 --> 17:33.867
the kind of guy
whose Twitter feed

17:33.867 --> 17:35.867
is full of quotes
from "The Big Lebowski"--

17:35.867 --> 17:38.867
he quotes it all the time--
and look,

17:38.867 --> 17:41.767
quoting "The Big Lebowski"
is fine in certain contexts--

17:41.767 --> 17:44.867
for example,
if you're an actor and it's 1998

17:44.867 --> 17:47.433
and you're filming
the movie "The Big Lebowski."

17:47.433 --> 17:49.633
But it is completely intolerable

17:49.633 --> 17:51.834
in any other context.

17:51.834 --> 17:55.233
And that's--that's not his only
"fun guy at the office" traits.

17:55.233 --> 17:58.266
Just watch his very first
press conference as chairman.

17:58.266 --> 17:59.900
- I would be happy
to take, uh, questions,

17:59.900 --> 18:02.200
uh, from the panel.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.567
- Monty, why don't you go ahead?

18:03.567 --> 18:05.500
- Monty Tayloe, "Comm Daily."

18:05.500 --> 18:08.934
Uh, how do you plan
to examine...

18:08.934 --> 18:12.600
- Yes, Ajit Pai is
the kind of guy

18:12.600 --> 18:15.900
who has a fun, oversized,
novelty mug,

18:15.900 --> 18:18.033
and he is really proud of it.

18:18.033 --> 18:20.734
Here's--here he is
showing off to a reporter,

18:20.734 --> 18:22.967
here he is showing it off
to his Twitter feed,

18:22.967 --> 18:25.200
and in his first speech
to his staff as commissioner,

18:25.200 --> 18:26.233
he said...

18:33.233 --> 18:34.400
And you heard right--

18:34.400 --> 18:37.400
he described his own mug
as infamous,

18:37.400 --> 18:39.367
which is offensive
for two reasons:

18:39.367 --> 18:40.533
first, at no point

18:40.533 --> 18:42.533
should you be describing
your own fun mug

18:42.533 --> 18:44.834
allowed in the company
of other adults,

18:44.834 --> 18:47.834
and second, it's a fucking mug.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.667
Calling a mug infamous is like

18:49.667 --> 18:52.700
calling your neti pot
a real panty-dropper.

18:52.700 --> 18:57.867
In no context
can that be remotely true!

18:57.867 --> 19:01.767
But for all of Pai's doofy "hey,
I'm just like you guys" persona,

19:01.767 --> 19:03.166
there are some things about him

19:03.166 --> 19:04.633
that you should really know.

19:04.633 --> 19:07.166
He's a former lawyer
for Verizon,

19:07.166 --> 19:08.967
and despite being a smart man,

19:08.967 --> 19:10.900
he sure loves to play dumb

19:10.900 --> 19:14.800
over why ISPs were ever moved
to Title II.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.433
- For decades before 2015,

19:17.433 --> 19:20.633
we had a free and open Internet.

19:20.633 --> 19:22.233
Indeed,
the free and open Internet

19:22.233 --> 19:25.367
developed and flourished
under light-touch regulation.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.300
We weren't living
in some digital dystopia

19:27.300 --> 19:30.100
before the partisan imposition
of a massive plan

19:30.100 --> 19:32.500
hatched in Washington
saved all of us.

19:32.500 --> 19:36.266
- Now, that is true:
2015 was not a digital dystopia

19:36.266 --> 19:38.533
for anyone,
with the possible exception

19:38.533 --> 19:39.533
of Pizza Rat,

19:39.533 --> 19:40.767
because think about it,

19:40.767 --> 19:43.000
the Internet put that rat
through hell.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.934
One cheat day in three months
of eating Paleo,

19:45.934 --> 19:48.133
and she never hears
the fucking end of it.

19:48.133 --> 19:50.767
Oh, that's right.
I said "she."

19:50.767 --> 19:54.133
#GREASYFILTHMONSTER.
#FEMINISM.

19:54.133 --> 19:57.600
But--but Pai's--
Pai's larger argument there

19:57.600 --> 19:59.233
is deeply disingenuous,

19:59.233 --> 20:03.266
because he has to know
that Verizon, his ex-employer,

20:03.266 --> 20:05.667
won a lawsuit
that meant if the FCC wanted

20:05.667 --> 20:07.633
strong, enforceable protection,

20:07.633 --> 20:11.667
its only real option
was to reclassify the ISPs,

20:11.667 --> 20:14.834
and yet, he cheerily insists
under questioning

20:14.834 --> 20:16.500
that there is just no evidence

20:16.500 --> 20:17.934
that cable companies
were engaging

20:17.934 --> 20:19.834
in rampant wrongdoing.

20:19.834 --> 20:22.734
- Let's just say Comcast created
a new TV series,

20:22.734 --> 20:24.433
and it just so happened
that that competed

20:24.433 --> 20:27.500
with a Netflix series
very similarly.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.400
If these rules go away,
how is the--

20:30.400 --> 20:32.266
how is there not
an incredible incentive

20:32.266 --> 20:36.300
for Comcast to slow Netflix down
coming into my house

20:36.300 --> 20:40.033
and make their video,
the Comcast video, very robust?

20:40.033 --> 20:41.967
- So, under that hypothetical,

20:41.967 --> 20:43.300
one of the things
that's important to remember

20:43.300 --> 20:45.100
is that it is a hypothetical,

20:45.100 --> 20:47.433
that we don't see evidence
of that happening

20:47.433 --> 20:49.600
in the marketplace
on a widespread level.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.533
- But here's the thing,
there are multiple examples

20:52.533 --> 20:54.834
of ISP fuckery over the years.

20:54.834 --> 20:56.100
For instance, a few years back,

20:56.100 --> 20:58.233
Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile

20:58.233 --> 21:00.734
at one point shut out
Google Wallet

21:00.734 --> 21:01.734
from their phones,

21:01.734 --> 21:03.533
a product that coincidentally

21:03.533 --> 21:04.734
happened to compete

21:04.734 --> 21:06.800
with their own
mobile payment app,

21:06.800 --> 21:09.567
an app, incidentally,
that had a significant flaw.

21:09.567 --> 21:12.567
It's a little subtle,
but see if you can spot it.

21:12.567 --> 21:15.700
- Following in the footsteps
of PayPal and Google Wallet

21:15.700 --> 21:19.333
is a virtual mobile wallet app
called ISIS.

21:19.333 --> 21:22.333
- That is fucking incredible.

21:22.333 --> 21:25.500
If--if only because
it means that at some point,

21:25.500 --> 21:28.400
someone's mom probably sent
a text along the lines of,

21:28.400 --> 21:31.467
"How do I make a payment
to ISIS? Love, Mom.

21:31.467 --> 21:34.333
P.S.
Let me know about Passover."

21:34.333 --> 21:35.333
And--and incidentally,

21:35.333 --> 21:36.800
when people complained

21:36.800 --> 21:38.467
that they couldn't use
Google Wallet,

21:38.467 --> 21:41.600
T-Mobile sent out tweets,
and this is true, like,

21:41.600 --> 21:43.633
"We're supporting ISIS,"

21:43.633 --> 21:45.767
"We're really loving ISIS,"

21:45.767 --> 21:47.834
and "We have chosen
to work with ISIS

21:47.834 --> 21:51.133
and hope to roll that out
to everyone very soon."

21:51.133 --> 21:55.066
And yet, despite T-Mobile's
vocal support for ISIS,

21:55.066 --> 21:57.567
which is all you should
ever think about now

21:57.567 --> 21:59.834
whenever you hear
the word "T-Mobile"--

21:59.834 --> 22:01.100
or "ISIS," for that matter,

22:01.100 --> 22:03.333
they're essentially
the same thing--

22:03.333 --> 22:06.834
Pai's main argument
is that we don't need Title II

22:06.834 --> 22:08.300
to have net neutrality,

22:08.300 --> 22:10.600
but some of his ideas
for what to have instead

22:10.600 --> 22:12.834
are almost laughably lax.

22:12.834 --> 22:14.433
For instance,
he reportedly floated

22:14.433 --> 22:17.500
just having ISPs
voluntarily agree

22:17.500 --> 22:20.433
not to obstruct or slow
consumer access to web content

22:20.433 --> 22:23.533
by putting that promise
in their terms of service--

22:23.533 --> 22:27.433
you know, the things that
no human being has ever read

22:27.433 --> 22:30.433
and that can change
whenever companies want them to.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.400
That idea would basically make
net neutrality

22:32.400 --> 22:35.467
as binding as a proposal
on "The Bachelor."

22:35.467 --> 22:37.200
"Vanessa, I have determined you

22:37.200 --> 22:39.800
"to be marginally better
for my brand than Corinne,

22:39.800 --> 22:41.166
"but I reserve the right

22:41.166 --> 22:42.800
"to change this agreement
in the future

22:42.800 --> 22:46.967
should ABC ever offer me
a slot on 'Fuck Pile Island.'"

22:46.967 --> 22:50.867
And--and--and Pai's
other big argument

22:50.867 --> 22:52.934
to remove ISPs from Title II

22:52.934 --> 22:56.500
is that it places too great
a regulatory burden on companies

22:56.500 --> 22:58.367
and that
it's already caused them

22:58.367 --> 23:00.033
to scale back their investment

23:00.033 --> 23:01.834
in broadband networks.

23:01.834 --> 23:04.233
- The economics are simple here.

23:04.233 --> 23:06.266
The more heavy
you regulate something,

23:06.266 --> 23:08.367
the less of it
you're going to get.

23:08.367 --> 23:12.300
So, what happened
after the FCC imposed Title II?

23:12.300 --> 23:13.400
Sure enough,

23:13.400 --> 23:15.300
infrastructure investment
declines.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.767
- Okay, so what he's essentially
suggesting there

23:17.767 --> 23:19.800
is that as soon
as Title II came in,

23:19.800 --> 23:22.467
companies said, "Fuck it,
investing in infrastructure

23:22.467 --> 23:23.900
"is way too difficult now.

23:23.900 --> 23:24.934
"We're not doing it anymore.

23:24.934 --> 23:26.300
"In fact, pull some of the cable

23:26.300 --> 23:27.433
"out of the ground.

23:27.433 --> 23:29.233
We're going back
to the telegraph."

23:29.233 --> 23:31.533
But--but it is worth noting

23:31.533 --> 23:34.000
infrastructure investment
is harder to measure

23:34.000 --> 23:35.133
than you may think,

23:35.133 --> 23:36.834
and Pai's numbers
are in dispute.

23:36.834 --> 23:39.033
In fact, several companies
have gone on the record

23:39.033 --> 23:41.600
saying their business
has largely been unaffected

23:41.600 --> 23:43.033
by Title II,

23:43.033 --> 23:45.500
and maybe the best way
to gauge Title II's impact

23:45.500 --> 23:47.200
is to listen
to what cable companies

23:47.200 --> 23:48.667
told their own investors,

23:48.667 --> 23:50.533
to whom
they are legally obligated

23:50.533 --> 23:52.000
to tell the truth.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.734
So here is what Verizon
told its investors in 2014

23:55.734 --> 23:58.633
about what the switch
to Title II would mean for them.

24:13.233 --> 24:14.233
- Oh, okay.

24:14.233 --> 24:15.700
So that doesn't really sound

24:15.700 --> 24:17.934
like net neutrality
was jeopardizing investment

24:17.934 --> 24:20.867
at all, although to be fair,
that was a phone call,

24:20.867 --> 24:23.433
and it was Verizon,
so it's entirely possible

24:23.433 --> 24:25.967
that every other word
was dropped.

24:25.967 --> 24:28.333
The--the fact is--
the fact is,

24:28.333 --> 24:31.066
Title II is the most solid
legal foundation

24:31.066 --> 24:32.066
we have right now

24:32.066 --> 24:33.533
for a strong, enforceable

24:33.533 --> 24:35.133
net neutrality protections,

24:35.133 --> 24:36.767
so Pai saying

24:36.767 --> 24:38.900
"let's have an open Internet
without it"

24:38.900 --> 24:40.433
is like me saying
"hey, how about

24:40.433 --> 24:42.166
"you have a gallon of coffee

24:42.166 --> 24:44.233
"without
your stupid fucking mug?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.000
"Just pour it into your hands,

24:46.000 --> 24:47.834
and trust
that you won't get burned."

24:47.834 --> 24:49.066
Oh, and Mr. Chairman,

24:49.066 --> 24:50.333
I know that
you're probably thinking,

24:50.333 --> 24:52.200
"Well,
you're only making fun of my mug

24:52.200 --> 24:53.767
because you're jealous of it,"

24:53.767 --> 24:57.867
to which--to which I would say,
why would I be jealous?

24:57.867 --> 24:59.467
Your mug's not that big.

24:59.467 --> 25:02.533
[cheers and applause]

25:03.734 --> 25:06.133
You want to know
what I'm drinking?

25:06.133 --> 25:09.734
I'm drinking
the blood of smaller mugs.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.467
Cheers.

25:13.467 --> 25:16.533
Now--
now, the ISPs--

25:16.533 --> 25:18.033
the ISPs will tell you

25:18.033 --> 25:19.900
that net neutrality
could be protected

25:19.900 --> 25:21.400
by an act of Congress,

25:21.400 --> 25:24.734
but I do not particularly trust
this or any Congress

25:24.734 --> 25:26.667
to get something
as complicated as this right,

25:26.667 --> 25:29.667
and I definitely wouldn't want
the current president involved,

25:29.667 --> 25:32.400
as,
and this will not surprise you,

25:32.400 --> 25:36.633
he doesn't seem to have any idea
what any of this is.

25:36.633 --> 25:39.033
- Trump once tweeted
back in 2014,

25:39.033 --> 25:40.433
"Obama's attack on the Internet

25:40.433 --> 25:42.533
"is another top-down power grab.

25:42.533 --> 25:45.033
"Net neutrality is
the Fairness Doctrine.

25:45.033 --> 25:47.166
Will target conservative media."

25:47.166 --> 25:50.467
- But that's the exact opposite
of what it did!

25:50.467 --> 25:53.200
Trump could not have been
more off-base if he tweeted,

25:53.200 --> 25:55.467
"Net neutrality is
the Monroe Doctrine.

25:55.467 --> 25:57.934
Will target the Wu-Tang Clan."

25:57.934 --> 26:00.800
So, sadly, it seems once more

26:00.800 --> 26:04.000
we the people must take
this matter into our own hands,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.800
uh, 'cause the FCC are again
going to invite public comment

26:06.800 --> 26:09.166
on their website,
and conveniently for them,

26:09.166 --> 26:12.066
the process is actually
a lot more complicated this time

26:12.066 --> 26:13.400
than it was three years ago.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.433
You have to go to...

26:20.767 --> 26:22.300
Then, when you get to this page,

26:22.300 --> 26:25.967
put in the proceeding number,
which is 17-108,

26:25.967 --> 26:27.100
then hit "search,"

26:27.100 --> 26:28.166
and on the next page,

26:28.166 --> 26:29.467
"Restoring Internet Freedom"

26:29.467 --> 26:30.967
should be the only result
you see.

26:30.967 --> 26:33.567
Then click on
the link that says "express,"

26:33.567 --> 26:35.467
and then, and only then,
can you leave your comment.

26:35.467 --> 26:36.867
And if you're thinking,
"Well, look,

26:36.867 --> 26:38.333
that's just too complicated,
I'm not doing it,"

26:38.333 --> 26:41.000
don't worry, 'cause that's why
we bought the URL

26:41.000 --> 26:43.166
gofccyourself.com,

26:43.166 --> 26:44.700
and if you simply go there,

26:44.700 --> 26:47.333
it will land you
straight on this page

26:47.333 --> 26:48.867
where all you have to do

26:48.867 --> 26:50.133
is hit "express"

26:50.133 --> 26:52.533
and comment, telling Ajit Pai

26:52.533 --> 26:55.934
that you specifically support
strong net neutrality

26:55.934 --> 26:58.934
backed by Title II oversight
of ISPs,

26:58.934 --> 27:02.066
and every Internet group needs
to come together

27:02.066 --> 27:03.900
like you successfully did
three years ago.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.934
Every subculture must join
as one:

27:05.934 --> 27:08.367
gamers, YouTube celebrities,

27:08.367 --> 27:09.600
Instagram models,

27:09.600 --> 27:12.400
Tom from Myspace,
if you're still alive.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.667
We need all of you,

27:13.667 --> 27:15.834
even, and I cannot believe
I'm saying this,

27:15.834 --> 27:19.367
Donald Trump's Internet fans
on sites like 4chan and Reddit,

27:19.367 --> 27:22.133
the most powerful online trolls
of all.

27:22.133 --> 27:23.934
This subject
is one of the few things

27:23.934 --> 27:25.834
that we actually
really agree on,

27:25.834 --> 27:29.500
so simply express yourselves,
and harness the rage

27:29.500 --> 27:31.300
that you normally reserve
for me,

27:31.300 --> 27:32.767
the rage you used when you said

27:32.767 --> 27:35.200
I'm "genuinely one
of the most visually

27:35.200 --> 27:37.900
and intellectually repulsive
people I've ever seen,"

27:37.900 --> 27:41.633
with "oddly long thumbs,"
"batshit crazy eyes,"

27:41.633 --> 27:44.967
and a "mouth that looks like
a cemetery after an earthquake."

27:44.967 --> 27:46.900
That's pretty good.
That's pretty good.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.867
The point is,
everyone needs to get involved.

27:49.867 --> 27:51.000
Comment now,

27:51.000 --> 27:52.400
and then maybe comment again

27:52.400 --> 27:54.367
once the FCC makes
its proposal official.

27:54.367 --> 27:57.033
Even call your representative
and your senators,

27:57.033 --> 27:58.667
and do not tell me

27:58.667 --> 28:00.767
that you don't have time
to do this.

28:00.767 --> 28:02.834
If the Internet is evidence
of nothing else,

28:02.834 --> 28:06.734
it is evidence that we all have
way too much time on our hands,

28:06.734 --> 28:08.400
and yes, I'm talking to you,

28:08.400 --> 28:10.834
everyone who posted
"may the fourth be with you"

28:10.834 --> 28:14.400
for Star Wars Day
this and every fucking year,

28:14.400 --> 28:16.967
and I'm talking to you,
everyone who posted on Facebook

28:16.967 --> 28:20.100
about ten concerts you've seen
and one you didn't,

28:20.100 --> 28:22.266
and to you,
everyone who did it ironically

28:22.266 --> 28:23.567
and added a clever joke twist,

28:23.567 --> 28:24.867
because, and this is important,

28:24.867 --> 28:26.867
you are exactly as bad,

28:26.867 --> 28:30.066
because you cannot say
that you are too busy

28:30.066 --> 28:32.967
when 540,000 of you commented

28:32.967 --> 28:35.033
on Beyoncé's
pregnancy announcement

28:35.033 --> 28:37.100
and 673 of you took the time

28:37.100 --> 28:39.834
to review the Grand Canyon
on Yelp,

28:39.834 --> 28:42.734
seven of whom gave it
a one-star review.

28:42.734 --> 28:45.300
What the fuck is wrong with you?

28:45.300 --> 28:48.367
And I'm specifically
looking at you,

28:48.367 --> 28:49.467
person on Amazon

28:49.467 --> 28:50.934
who gave
"The Wolf of Wall Street"

28:50.934 --> 28:52.800
one star because, and I quote,

28:52.800 --> 28:55.200
"There were no wolves
in the movie."

28:55.200 --> 28:58.633
And to you,
the 31 people who took the time

28:58.633 --> 29:01.567
to say
they found that review helpful.

29:01.567 --> 29:03.000
And finally, I'm looking

29:03.000 --> 29:04.867
at the frankly
surprising number of people

29:04.867 --> 29:07.934
who for some reason
keep tweeting "choke me, daddy"

29:07.934 --> 29:09.533
at the Pope.

29:09.533 --> 29:12.200
You are--
you're wasting your time!

29:12.200 --> 29:14.533
He's not going to choke you.

29:14.533 --> 29:17.767
The optics would be very bad!

29:17.767 --> 29:18.934
So come on.

29:18.934 --> 29:21.000
I'm calling upon all of you,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.500
the Internet's timewasters
and troublemakers,

29:24.500 --> 29:26.200
to join me once more

29:26.200 --> 29:29.400
in just five to ten minutes
of minor effort.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.400
I need you to do this.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.934
Once more unto the breach,
my friends.

29:33.934 --> 29:37.367
Simply go to this URL
and tell the FCC

29:37.367 --> 29:40.300
to preserve net neutrality
and Title II.

29:40.300 --> 29:43.467
Once again, commenters,
America needs you to rise,

29:43.467 --> 29:45.567
or, more accurately,
remain seated

29:45.567 --> 29:47.500
in front of
your computer screen,

29:47.500 --> 29:48.700
to this occasion,

29:48.700 --> 29:50.767
so please, fly, my pretties!

29:50.767 --> 29:52.667
Fly once more!

29:52.667 --> 29:53.700
That is our show!

29:53.700 --> 29:54.934
Thanks for watching!

29:54.934 --> 29:56.033
See you next week!

29:56.033 --> 29:58.233
Good night!
Fly away!

29:58.233 --> 30:01.266
[cheers and applause]
