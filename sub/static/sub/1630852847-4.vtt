Okay, I see you, Kara Walker.

in your studio for years.

get my space back.

You need opportunities, luck.

perfect timing,

bank selling vinyl anyway.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.221

Are you an actress or a singer?

You painted that

21:18.486 --> 21:19.904
I was a teacher there.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.990

Yeah, I painted that.

we're meeting with

21:44.387 --> 21:45.930

21:45.972 --> 21:47.932

I used to be a painter?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.351
- Hm?

21:49.392 --> 21:51.061
Oh, I just meant
you're not currently painting

21:51.102 --> 21:53.021
at a professional level.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.023
You're an ex-artist.

from their last work.

using dirty cops as witnesses.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.609

22:39.651 --> 22:41.820
- The police union'd
be all over my Black ass.

is critical.

40:06.948 --> 40:10.368
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

40:10.410 --> 40:13.955
- Our justice system is
failing us,

40:13.997 --> 40:15.373
and a wholesale change needs

40:15.415 --> 40:18.001
to be made from policing
to prosecution.

40:18.043 --> 40:19.627
- Yes!
- Yeah!

40:19.669 --> 40:21.713
- And I'm prepared to fight
for a new approach,

40:21.755 --> 40:24.174
even if that makes me unpopular
with the mayor's office

40:24.215 --> 40:26.426
or the LAPD.

40:31.681 --> 40:35.060
Because the DA

Next question.

40:51.910 --> 40:54.746
- Yo!
Nah, but that was a good time.

40:54.788 --> 40:56.706
- That was really fun.
We have to do that again.

40:56.748 --> 41:00.043
- Yes.
- I really want to.

41:00.085 --> 41:02.462
- Now, that was
a fun campaign event.

41:02.504 --> 41:04.547
- Hell, yeah.
I could have gone all night.

41:04.589 --> 41:06.216
- You might just be
going all night.

41:06.257 --> 41:08.218
- Hm, is that a promise?
- Mm-hmm.

41:08.259 --> 41:09.803
- Ew, what the hell?

41:09.844 --> 41:11.012
- Oh, come on now!
Come on now!

41:11.054 --> 41:12.514
- Why would you do that
in front of us?

41:12.555 --> 41:13.890
- I'm so glad I don't share
a wall with y'all.

41:13.932 --> 41:15.433
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you do realize

41:15.475 --> 41:16.893
that this kind of talk brought
you into this world, right?

41:16.935 --> 41:19.354
- Ew, no one wanted
to know that at all.

41:19.396 --> 41:21.314
- Before you retire, Romeo,

41:21.356 --> 41:22.941
I need to have a quick chat
with you.

41:22.982 --> 41:24.859
- You are such a buzzkill.
- Mm.

41:24.901 --> 41:27.278
- Hold that thought.
- Mm-hmm.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.697
- All right, all right.
My office.

41:33.410 --> 41:34.661
- So you're gonna admit
I was right,

41:34.703 --> 41:36.121
or do I gotta say
I told you so?

41:36.162 --> 41:37.372
- Look, I backed your idea

41:37.414 --> 41:38.707
in front of my parents,
didn't I?

41:38.748 --> 41:41.292
- Only because Uncle Phil
was gonna agree anyway.

41:41.334 --> 41:44.713
- Point is,
I didn't fight you on it.

41:46.881 --> 41:50.468
Look, we just
keep it like this.

41:50.510 --> 41:51.928
Quit trying to trip
each other up.

41:53.763 --> 41:56.808
- I can get with that.
Good night, C.

42:00.603 --> 42:02.564
- Good night, Will.

42:09.863 --> 42:12.240
- Thank you.

42:12.282 --> 42:14.659
Oh, my God!

42:14.701 --> 42:17.579
Tonight just got even better!
I'm moving out.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.080
- Really?
- Yes.

42:19.122 --> 42:21.374
So I got accepted
into an influencer house.

42:21.416 --> 42:22.584
So I'm gonna be living

42:22.625 --> 42:24.711
with other social media
content creators.

42:24.753 --> 42:26.379
- Influencer house.

42:26.421 --> 42:27.714
- Yes, it's a thing.

42:27.756 --> 42:30.008
So Will's friend Jazz
has a record store,

42:30.050 --> 42:32.969
and when they saw what I did
with his IG in one day,

42:33.011 --> 42:34.429
they said I was in.

42:34.471 --> 42:35.847
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what kind of strings

42:35.889 --> 42:37.223
are attached
to that arrangement?

42:37.265 --> 42:39.559
- None. It's free.

42:39.601 --> 42:42.145
- Hilary, nothing is free.

42:44.105 --> 42:48.526
- Would it kill you to just say
congratulations for once?
