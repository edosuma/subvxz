WEBVTT

01:28:40.351 --> 01:28:43.150
<i>Isaac: That's great news, Bill.
Sensational.</i>

01:28:43.221 --> 01:28:44.711
<i>We'll treat him very well.</i>

01:28:44.789 --> 01:28:47.815
<i>I say, we'll treat
your client very well, Bill.</i>

01:28:47.892 --> 01:28:50.554
Take care. Heh heh heh heh!

01:28:50.628 --> 01:28:52.153
-- We got him?
-- How much do you love me?

01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:54.392
-- We got him? -- I'm asking you
right now at this very moment --

01:28:54.465 --> 01:28:56.160
-- how much do you love me?
-- Isaac?

01:28:56.234 --> 01:28:57.565
We...got...him.

01:28:57.635 --> 01:28:58.966
-- We got him?!
-- We got him!

01:28:59.036 --> 01:29:00.367
-- We got him?!
-- We got him!

01:29:00.438 --> 01:29:01.667
-- [ Gasps]
-- We got him!

01:29:01.739 --> 01:29:03.764
Christian Patrick
right here in our studio.

01:29:03.841 --> 01:29:04.808
It's not remote?

01:29:04.876 --> 01:29:06.810
In our studio
tomorrow night at 11:00!

01:29:06.878 --> 01:29:09.006
I am so hot for you
right now.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.242
-- You know who ESPN's got?
-- No.

01:29:11.315 --> 01:29:13.443
I don't either, but
it's not Christian Patrick.

01:29:13.517 --> 01:29:16.077
We gotta promote
the hell out of this, Isaac.

01:29:16.153 --> 01:29:17.086
I know.

01:29:17.154 --> 01:29:19.748
-- I mean, you gotta get on the phone
with Promotions right now. -- <i>I will.</i>

01:29:19.824 --> 01:29:21.918
Get them out of bed!
It's moving day.

01:29:21.993 --> 01:29:23.518
-- It's a big day. -- <i>I</i> mean,
<i>this</i> is a coup, Isaac.

01:29:23.594 --> 01:29:24.857
We need it promoted!

01:29:24.929 --> 01:29:28.126
What, do I look like I just
sailed in from Minskapinsk?

01:29:28.199 --> 01:29:31.134
No, you don't, but you've gotta
stop using Yiddish expressions.

01:29:31.202 --> 01:29:32.294
They work for me!

01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:33.804
[Chuckling]
Not as much as you think.

01:29:34.939 --> 01:29:37.408
-- I'm thinking seriously about doing it.
-- I wouldn't.

01:29:37.475 --> 01:29:39.068
I'm thinking seriously
about it.

01:29:39.143 --> 01:29:40.668
-- <i>What do you think?</i>
-- I <i>wouldn't.</i>

01:29:40.745 --> 01:29:41.735
-- <i>Guys?</i>
-- No.

01:29:41.812 --> 01:29:43.211
It's not a good idea.

01:29:43.281 --> 01:29:44.976
I wouldn't do it.

01:29:45.049 --> 01:29:48.110
I want this now.
This is important to me.

01:29:48.185 --> 01:29:50.085
I'm an adult,
and I wanna grow a goatee.

01:29:50.154 --> 01:29:51.121
-- Danny.
-- Dana.

01:29:51.188 --> 01:29:53.282
-- How much do you love me?
-- I wanna grow a goatee.

01:29:53.357 --> 01:29:55.553
Very, very bad idea.
How much do you love me?

01:29:55.626 --> 01:29:56.457
I think
it would look good.

01:29:56.527 --> 01:29:57.722
I think you'd look like
Colonel Sanders.

01:29:57.795 --> 01:29:59.456
How much do you love me?

01:29:59.530 --> 01:30:01.396
A little less than I did before
the “Colonel Sanders“ thing.

01:30:01.465 --> 01:30:03.126
We got Christian Patrick.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.167
-- Seriously?
-- Tomorrow night.

01:30:04.235 --> 01:30:05.396
Remote from the locker room?

01:30:05.469 --> 01:30:07.665
In the studio,
my clean-shaven friend.

01:30:07.738 --> 01:30:09.536
In the studio -- 5 minutes.

01:30:09.607 --> 01:30:11.507
Oh, we gotta promote
the hell out of this.

01:30:11.575 --> 01:30:13.771
Ah, do I look like I just
sailed in from Minskapinsk?

01:30:13.844 --> 01:30:16.336
I really couldn't say, but I still think
we should promote this interview.

01:30:16.414 --> 01:30:18.109
-- Yes!
-- Good job.

01:30:18.182 --> 01:30:19.911
[Gasps] Natalie!

01:30:19.984 --> 01:30:20.815
Yes, ma'am.

01:30:20.885 --> 01:30:22.751
How much do you love me,
right now, this very second?

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:23.787
-- What did I do?
-- Nothing.

01:30:23.854 --> 01:30:26.551
I'm asking how much
this very second --

01:30:26.624 --> 01:30:27.716
You know what?
Never mind.

01:30:27.792 --> 01:30:29.260
Tomorrow night...

01:30:29.327 --> 01:30:32.058
you are going to go out to the
Meadowlands and do a pre-interview.

01:30:32.129 --> 01:30:34.723
-- Since when do we do pre-interviews?
-- Since we booked Chris Patrick.

01:30:34.799 --> 01:30:35.630
-- You're kidding.
-- No.

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:36.861
Seriously?

01:30:36.934 --> 01:30:39.426
Tomorrow night, we are gonna win
our time slot in 14 major markets

01:30:39.503 --> 01:30:41.494
for the first time
since we went on the air.

01:30:41.572 --> 01:30:44.098
Does this strike you as something
I'm inclined to joke about?

01:30:44.175 --> 01:30:44.971
-- No.
-- See?

01:30:45.042 --> 01:30:47.568
But you're not generally inclined to
joke about much of anything at all.

01:30:47.645 --> 01:30:48.669
Yes. But if I were,
this wouldn't be it.

01:30:48.746 --> 01:30:50.145
-- Right.
-- Now, what does that mean?

01:30:50.214 --> 01:30:51.841
-- What does what mean? -- Are you
saying I don't have a sense of humor?

01:30:51.916 --> 01:30:53.077
-- Dana, I --
-- Never mind.

01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:56.211
You'll interview him right after the
game tomorrow, then hustle on back.

01:30:56.287 --> 01:30:58.517
I need you here
90 minutes before showtime.

01:30:58.589 --> 01:30:59.681
-- You sure you don't want Jeremy?
-- I want you.

01:30:59.757 --> 01:31:01.191
-- Jeremy knows the NFL.
-- So do you.

01:31:01.258 --> 01:31:02.623
-- Not like Jeremy.
-- You'll do fine.

01:31:02.693 --> 01:31:05.424
Show me a list of the questions,
and don't play softball.

01:31:05.496 --> 01:31:06.895
This man is a convicted felon,

01:31:06.964 --> 01:31:08.932
and he's talking to us
and nobody else,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.230
-- so let's make it count, you got it?
-- Yeah.

01:31:11.302 --> 01:31:13.600
This show's lived in third place
long enough, Natalie.

01:31:13.671 --> 01:31:14.604
It's moving day!

01:31:14.672 --> 01:31:16.333
-- Dana, you are wired.
-- Yes, I am!

01:31:16.407 --> 01:31:18.432
Plus...l have a terrific
sense of humor.

01:31:18.509 --> 01:31:20.102
I know lots and lots of jokes.

01:31:20.177 --> 01:31:21.372
People say that about you.

01:31:21.445 --> 01:31:22.879
Good. Go.

01:31:23.948 --> 01:31:25.211
"SportsCenter"...

01:31:25.282 --> 01:31:26.750
"Fox Sports News"...

01:31:26.817 --> 01:31:29.514
and here comes
"Sports Night,"

01:31:29.587 --> 01:31:32.147
led by Dana Whitaker
in the number-3 car.

01:31:32.223 --> 01:31:35.784
I'm talking to myself,
and that can't be a good sign.

01:31:38.562 --> 01:31:40.724
A lot of great and distinguished
men have worn goatees.

01:31:40.798 --> 01:31:43.165
I'll give you $100 if you don't
start naming them for me.

01:31:43.234 --> 01:31:44.292
-- King Tut.
-- Thank you.

01:31:44.368 --> 01:31:46.894
-- Sigmund Freud.
-- Dan, <i>Casey.</i>

01:31:46.971 --> 01:31:48.063
Galileo is another.

01:31:48.139 --> 01:31:50.403
Uh, I've just been on
a conference call

01:31:50.474 --> 01:31:52.602
with Patrick's agent
and his lawyer.

01:31:52.676 --> 01:31:54.110
Ah, and here come
the guidelines.

01:31:54.178 --> 01:31:55.509
5 minutes and 30 seconds total.

01:31:55.579 --> 01:31:57.274
Casey will ask a question
with a follow-up,

01:31:57.348 --> 01:31:58.543
then Dan, and so on.

01:31:58.616 --> 01:31:59.606
Mary Pat Shelby?

01:31:59.683 --> 01:32:00.650
Off limits.

01:32:00.718 --> 01:32:01.776
How off limits?

01:32:01.852 --> 01:32:03.377
Completely off limits.

01:32:03.454 --> 01:32:05.718
-- Totally off limits?
-- Entirely off limits.

01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:07.451
No questions
about Mary Pat Shelby.

01:32:07.525 --> 01:32:08.458
Really?

01:32:08.526 --> 01:32:10.085
We're just gonna talk
about football.

01:32:10.161 --> 01:32:11.458
How 'bout something
like this --

01:32:11.529 --> 01:32:12.963
<i>Chris, what were you thinking</i>

01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:14.691
when you punched your girlfriend
in the face

01:32:14.765 --> 01:32:16.130
and threw her down
that flight of stairs?

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.167
I'm sorry, I meant,

01:32:17.234 --> 01:32:19.259
"How the heck did you catch
that pass against the Raiders?"

01:32:19.336 --> 01:32:20.826
No, that would be
a bad thing to do.

01:32:20.905 --> 01:32:22.964
And you make this agreement
two hours before the show?

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.565
It was the only time!

01:32:24.642 --> 01:32:26.770
You are getting played
like a fiddle, and I'm serious.

01:32:26.844 --> 01:32:28.608
<i>I am not getting played.
I got beat.</i>

01:32:28.679 --> 01:32:30.408
-- Damn <i>right you got beat.</i>
-- <i>I know. I got beat.</i>

01:32:30.481 --> 01:32:32.643
<i>You promote the thing
nonstop, all day, all night,</i>

01:32:32.716 --> 01:32:34.184
then they get you to agree
to this nonsense

01:32:34.251 --> 01:32:35.810
at the eleventh hour, when there's
no chance you'll pull it.

01:32:35.886 --> 01:32:36.944
You got beat like a drum.

01:32:37.021 --> 01:32:40.184
Something was better than
nothing, and we needed this.

01:32:40.257 --> 01:32:41.656
Yeah, and Patrick's people
need to show

01:32:41.725 --> 01:32:44.251
-- their guy can still sell
sneakers and soda. -- [Cup rattles]

01:32:44.328 --> 01:32:46.023
And when the whole thing's
over...

01:32:46.097 --> 01:32:49.032
we hop in the shower, and they leave
the money on the night table.

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.091
<i>Plus, we get to show
Mary Pat Shelby</i>

01:32:51.168 --> 01:32:52.897
that unless she can catch
80 passes in a season,

01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:54.301
the world couldn't honestly
give a damn

01:32:54.371 --> 01:32:55.702
about her concussion
and broken jaw.

01:32:55.773 --> 01:32:58.470
I don't think I need
a civics lesson from you, Casey.

01:32:58.542 --> 01:32:59.976
Well, I think you need one
from somebody, Dana,

01:33:00.044 --> 01:33:01.603
'cause you're doing
a big thing badly.

01:33:01.679 --> 01:33:04.546
<i>I'm aware of the
moral questions posed by this,</i>

01:33:04.615 --> 01:33:06.549
<i>but I'm also aware of the fact</i>

01:33:06.617 --> 01:33:09.746
that this is a third-place show
that doesn't deserve to be.

01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:11.982
<i>But I can't educate viewers
to that fact</i>

01:33:12.056 --> 01:33:14.047
unless they're watching us
in the first place.

01:33:14.125 --> 01:33:16.787
So... your pedantic scolding
aside,

01:33:16.861 --> 01:33:18.056
<i>I'll do anything,</i>

01:33:18.129 --> 01:33:19.756
short of a "wet T-shirt" contest
to get us there,

01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:21.025
and these days,

01:33:21.098 --> 01:33:23.328
the "wet T-shirt" contest
isn't looking so bad to me.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.698
-- You see what I'm saying?
-- I wasn't really listening.

01:33:25.769 --> 01:33:28.739
I was handicapping the odds of something
falling on your head when you were talking.

01:33:28.806 --> 01:33:29.637
Oh.

01:33:30.441 --> 01:33:32.170
These are the guidelines.

01:33:32.243 --> 01:33:34.371
-- Hey, you wanna get involved with this?
-- <i>I</i> so don't.

01:33:34.445 --> 01:33:35.173
Thank you.

01:33:35.246 --> 01:33:36.680
-- Didn't you used to care
about these things? -- Yes.

01:33:36.747 --> 01:33:38.579
-- And it wasn't that long
ago that you did. -- No.

01:33:38.649 --> 01:33:40.139
-- I mean, it was, like, yesterday.
-- Right.

01:33:40.217 --> 01:33:42.914
Now, when I say "yesterday,"
I'm not speaking metaphorically.

01:33:42.987 --> 01:33:44.853
<i>I mean it was yesterday.</i>

01:33:44.922 --> 01:33:46.321
What happened
to your values?

01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:47.755
I find that maintaining them
is a lot of work.

01:33:47.825 --> 01:33:49.384
I take a day off
every now and then.

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:51.861
-- You take a vacation from
doing the right thing? -- Yeah.

01:33:51.929 --> 01:33:53.090
I don't loot storefronts
or anything,

01:33:53.164 --> 01:33:55.360
but once in a while, when I
consider the effort it takes

01:33:55.432 --> 01:33:57.196
to diligently adhere
to a moral compass,

01:33:57.268 --> 01:33:59.737
I take myself out of the lineup
and I rest for the next game.

01:33:59.803 --> 01:34:02.033
I swear, you could run
for Congress and win.

01:34:02.106 --> 01:34:04.598
-- <i>Not</i> with a <i>goatee.</i>
-- <i>Yeah, that's true.</i>

01:34:13.751 --> 01:34:17.187
[Telephone ringing]

01:34:25.429 --> 01:34:26.794
-- Hey.
-- Oh, hey.

01:34:26.864 --> 01:34:28.730
-- How did it go? -- I didn't
know anyone was using the room.

01:34:28.799 --> 01:34:29.857
I'm pretty much done.

01:34:29.934 --> 01:34:31.299
I was just gonna put
the voiceover on

01:34:31.368 --> 01:34:32.699
the N.C. State/Clemson
package.

01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:34.204
-- You wanna see it?
-- No, let's do it later, okay?

01:34:34.271 --> 01:34:36.103
I need to get the pre-interview
notes together for Dana.

01:34:36.173 --> 01:34:37.607
-- What happened to your wrist?
-- What?

01:34:37.675 --> 01:34:39.837
-- What happened to your wrist?
-- Oh, God, yeah.

01:34:39.877 --> 01:34:41.709
-- It got jammed in a thing.
-- Is it all right?

01:34:41.779 --> 01:34:43.975
Yeah, I got it jammed in
the door by accident in the van.

01:34:44.048 --> 01:34:46.540
-- It was my own -- I closed it, and I
wasn't thinking -- -- It looks pretty sore.

01:34:46.617 --> 01:34:48.244
Yeah. No. It's fine.

01:34:48.319 --> 01:34:50.344
I once got an Indian burn
that looked like that.

01:34:50.421 --> 01:34:52.583
My sister Louise
tied me to a tree.

01:34:52.656 --> 01:34:55.557
[Laughs ] Why did your sister
Louise tie you to a tree?

01:34:55.626 --> 01:34:56.991
That's a perfectly fair
question,

01:34:57.061 --> 01:34:58.688
but I honestly
couldn't tell you.

01:34:58.762 --> 01:35:00.662
I'm gonna find another room.

01:35:00.731 --> 01:35:02.722
-- I should call and ask her.
-- Yeah!

01:35:04.635 --> 01:35:07.104
<i>All right, first of all...</i>

01:35:07.171 --> 01:35:09.936
a priest, a minister,
and a rabbi walk into a bar.

01:35:10.007 --> 01:35:11.168
-- What are you doing?
-- I'm telling a joke.

01:35:11.242 --> 01:35:13.074
A priest, a minister,
and a rabbi walk into a bar --

01:35:13.143 --> 01:35:14.133
Don't do it.

01:35:14.211 --> 01:35:15.542
-- Why?
-- It'll end badly for you.

01:35:15.613 --> 01:35:17.103
-- I can tell a joke.
-- No, you can't.

01:35:17.181 --> 01:35:19.513
-- <i>You've seen me tell jokes.</i>
-- <i>You telegraph yourjokes.</i>

01:35:19.583 --> 01:35:20.948
I don't telegraph my jokes.

01:35:21.018 --> 01:35:22.486
You do it with
a satanic grin.

01:35:22.553 --> 01:35:23.748
Ooh, Satan's another one.

01:35:23.821 --> 01:35:25.687
-- Another what? -- Goatee.
-- That's right.

01:35:25.756 --> 01:35:27.520
-- <i>You see?</i>
-- <i>Plus, he can tell</i> a <i>joke.</i>

01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:29.320
<i>Who thinks Danny
should grow a goatee?</i>

01:35:29.393 --> 01:35:30.827
-- No. -- No, I don't like it.
Not one bit. -- No.

01:35:30.894 --> 01:35:32.328
There it is.
20 through 30 --

01:35:32.396 --> 01:35:34.364
<i>do we have the film on
the Rangers and the Red Wings?</i>

01:35:34.431 --> 01:35:35.193
Toulouse-Lautrec.

01:35:35.266 --> 01:35:37.496
Are you just gonna keep naming
people with goatees?

01:35:37.568 --> 01:35:39.866
-- <i>As they come to me.</i> -- <i>It actually
presents</i> a <i>fighting problem.</i>

01:35:39.937 --> 01:35:41.098
A lighting problem?

01:35:41.171 --> 01:35:43.139
<i>People, we need to focus
for a minute.</i>

01:35:43.207 --> 01:35:44.140
Yes, the goatee.

01:35:44.208 --> 01:35:46.973
-- A <i>lighting problem?</i> -- <i>It would
be</i> a <i>bit of</i> a <i>fighting problem.</i>

01:35:47.044 --> 01:35:48.808
-- <i>Folks</i> --
-- <i>I have</i> a <i>hard time believing</i>

01:35:48.879 --> 01:35:51.473
that my growing a goatee is gonna cause any
kind of lighting problem, guys, all right?

01:35:51.548 --> 01:35:54.210
Hey, these guys still haven't
figured out how to light your nose.

01:35:54.285 --> 01:35:56.276
Can I get a flag
on that play, please?

01:35:56.353 --> 01:35:58.082
<i>20 through 30</i> --
<i>40, we go to Pebble Beach</i> --

01:35:58.155 --> 01:35:59.088
Excuse me, Dana.

01:35:59.156 --> 01:36:01.818
I'm sorry, but I have to get
some people on the phones.

01:36:01.892 --> 01:36:03.485
-- <i>What's</i> going <i>on?</i>
-- <i>I'm not sure yet.</i>

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.654
But there's a story
coming out of the Meadowlands.

01:36:05.729 --> 01:36:08.061
<i>A maintenance worker,
a custodian,</i>

01:36:08.132 --> 01:36:10.499
or somebody witnessed
Christian Patrick

01:36:10.567 --> 01:36:12.433
<i>in an otherwise empty
locker room</i>

01:36:12.503 --> 01:36:14.471
exposing himself to a woman.

01:36:14.538 --> 01:36:15.528
What does the woman say?

01:36:15.606 --> 01:36:16.767
We don't know
who the woman is,

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:19.002
but if she was in there,
it's likely she's press.

01:36:19.076 --> 01:36:20.566
He exposed himself?

01:36:20.644 --> 01:36:23.511
The thing is...he may have done
more than that.

01:36:24.415 --> 01:36:27.874
<i>The witness says he saw Patrick
grab the woman's arm...</i>

01:36:27.951 --> 01:36:29.419
and there was some kind
of struggle.

01:36:29.486 --> 01:36:30.248
-- Her arm?
-- Yes.

01:36:30.321 --> 01:36:32.449
-- Wait. He grabbed her arm?
-- Well, we're getting a lot --

01:36:32.523 --> 01:36:33.786
Could it have been
her wrist?

01:36:33.857 --> 01:36:35.655
-- Yes, but --
-- Son of a bitch.

01:36:35.726 --> 01:36:37.194
What's with him?

01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:41.095
It was Natalie.

01:36:41.165 --> 01:36:43.065
[Door closes]

01:36:43.133 --> 01:36:44.066
Ohh.

01:36:44.134 --> 01:36:45.226
[Door opens]

01:36:45.302 --> 01:36:47.896
<i>Um...[Clears throat]
everybody else...</i>

01:36:47.971 --> 01:36:49.063
work the phones.

01:36:51.408 --> 01:36:52.569
I'm fine.

01:36:52.643 --> 01:36:54.008
-- Is it just your wrist?
-- I'm fine.

01:36:54.078 --> 01:36:55.341
Did he hurt you
anyplace else?

01:36:55.412 --> 01:36:56.470
He didn't hurt me.

01:36:56.547 --> 01:36:57.844
-- Natalie. -- Dana.
-- Put this on.

01:36:57.915 --> 01:37:00.213
Keep it on top like this.
Don't put it underneath.

01:37:00.284 --> 01:37:01.342
It's not swollen.

01:37:01.418 --> 01:37:02.510
It will be.

01:37:02.586 --> 01:37:04.418
Put the ice on, Natalie.

01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:07.682
<i>Natalie...</i>

01:37:07.758 --> 01:37:09.749
he's gonna be here soon.

01:37:09.827 --> 01:37:12.592
We'll have a car come,
pick you up, take you home.

01:37:12.663 --> 01:37:14.688
Why do I need to go home?

01:37:14.765 --> 01:37:17.234
It's gonna be uncomfortable
for you when he gets here.

01:37:18.769 --> 01:37:20.203
Am I being fired?

01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:21.829
<i>Don't be ridiculous.
He's saying --</i>

01:37:21.905 --> 01:37:23.339
Then I'd like to stay.

01:37:23.407 --> 01:37:25.705
I'm the senior
associate producer here.

01:37:25.776 --> 01:37:27.471
I've got a show
in 38 minutes.

01:37:27.544 --> 01:37:29.535
I'd like to be allowed
to do my job.

01:37:31.181 --> 01:37:33.809
[Sighs]
Of course you can stay.

01:37:35.552 --> 01:37:38.419
Why don't we all
get back to work?

01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:41.618
[Door opens]

01:37:43.227 --> 01:37:44.991
<i>Marsha, get me someone
from Legal,</i>

01:37:45.062 --> 01:37:46.723
and you'd better call J.J.
at the network.

01:37:46.797 --> 01:37:48.390
Isaac, Christian Patrick's
in the lobby

01:37:48.465 --> 01:37:50.092
with Bill Evans
and David Burke.

01:37:50.167 --> 01:37:52.932
Put Patrick in the greenroom and have
Evans and Burke sent to my office.

01:37:53.003 --> 01:37:55.267
Natalie's in the edit bay.
Bring Patrick around the back.

01:37:57.241 --> 01:37:58.675
This is a whole new ballgame.

01:37:58.742 --> 01:37:59.436
-- It is?
-- Yeah.

01:37:59.510 --> 01:38:01.000
-- It's a whole new ballgame?
-- Casey --

01:38:01.078 --> 01:38:03.069
Because we only agreed
not to discuss Mary Pat Shelby,

01:38:03.147 --> 01:38:05.172
but we never agreed not to discuss
any further acts of violence.

01:38:05.249 --> 01:38:06.512
Is that why
it's a whole new ballgame?

01:38:06.583 --> 01:38:07.573
Listen!

01:38:08.352 --> 01:38:09.649
<i>You pompous jackass!</i>

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.917
lam closer to Natalie than anybody
in this world, and I'm also a woman,

01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:15.925
so don't imply that I'm somehow
insensitive to what's happened here.

01:38:15.993 --> 01:38:17.461
But...there happens to be

01:38:17.528 --> 01:38:19.519
an exclusive story
sitting in the greenroom

01:38:19.596 --> 01:38:22.759
that's gonna be wildfire whether
we light the match or not.

01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:24.494
<i>It happened. It's news.</i>

01:38:24.568 --> 01:38:27.868
I can't decide not to pursue it
just 'cause it happened to us!

01:38:27.938 --> 01:38:31.101
Not only that, I think Natalie
deserves to have her story told.

01:38:31.175 --> 01:38:32.540
Don't use the last part.

01:38:32.609 --> 01:38:34.168
What?

01:38:34.244 --> 01:38:35.643
You had me till the last part.

01:38:35.712 --> 01:38:37.771
<i>-- What do you -- -- Of course
it's a legitimate news story,</i>

01:38:37.848 --> 01:38:40.613
and it would be embarrassing if
we weren't the ones to break it.

01:38:40.684 --> 01:38:43.779
But Natalie didn't seem at all to
me anxious to have her story told.

01:38:43.854 --> 01:38:47.188
And speaking as a friend, I think
it's wrong of you to use that.

01:38:47.257 --> 01:38:49.988
I am not rationalizing, Danny.
lam saying what I believe.

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:52.722
<i>That's fine, but in a minute, you're gonna
have to float an argument by Isaac,</i>

01:38:52.796 --> 01:38:56.357

you had me till the last part.

01:38:56.433 --> 01:38:57.867
[Telephones ringing]

01:38:57.935 --> 01:38:59.960
You're right.

01:39:00.037 --> 01:39:03.564
Natalie doesn't want
the story to get out anyway.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.974
You know what?
It's a whole new ballgame.

01:39:09.746 --> 01:39:11.737
[Sighs]

01:39:11.815 --> 01:39:14.876
I thought you were taking a
break from moral accountability.

01:39:14.952 --> 01:39:17.819
-- I threw in one for nothing.
-- Hmm.

01:39:20.591 --> 01:39:24.221
<i>Man: We're not gonna let Chris Patrick
walk into an impromptu interrogation.</i>

01:39:24.294 --> 01:39:26.126
If it's not tonight,
then it's tomorrow morning.

01:39:26.196 --> 01:39:28.290
We don't know what happened.
We don't know if anything --

01:39:28.365 --> 01:39:30.595
We know Natalie has a mark on her
wrist the size of a charm bracelet,

01:39:30.667 --> 01:39:33.102
and we know we have a live
interview with your client.

01:39:33.170 --> 01:39:34.501
-- [ Sighs]
-- Well, talk to us.

01:39:34.571 --> 01:39:36.733
Despite a mountain
of fairly immutable evidence,

01:39:36.807 --> 01:39:38.172
I'm prepared to believe

01:39:38.242 --> 01:39:40.438
that what happened to Natalie
<i>didn't</i> happen to Natalie,

01:39:40.511 --> 01:39:41.672
<i>and I'm confident</i>

01:39:41.745 --> 01:39:44.305
<i>I can persuade Natalie
to see it the same way.</i>

01:39:44.381 --> 01:39:45.644
What's the catch?

01:39:45.716 --> 01:39:47.650
Mary Pat Shelby.

01:39:47.718 --> 01:39:49.015
What do we get?
What do you get?

01:39:49.086 --> 01:39:50.349
Natalie will deny reports

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:53.219
that she was sexually assaulted
in an empty locker room,

01:39:53.290 --> 01:39:57.158
and I'm including league security
as well as press inquiries.

01:39:57.227 --> 01:40:00.663
<i>In exchange, I get a 5-minute
interview with Patrick,</i>

01:40:00.731 --> 01:40:02.756
in which Mary Pat Shelby
is fair game.

01:40:02.833 --> 01:40:06.531
You do what I'm telling you, and your
client stays off “America's Most Wanted.“

01:40:06.603 --> 01:40:08.867
-- And you get your ratings.
-- Yes, I do.

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.669
We'll talk to Chris.

01:40:11.742 --> 01:40:14.006
Do it now.

[Door opens]

01:40:49.112 --> 01:40:50.637
What was that about?

01:40:50.714 --> 01:40:52.011
It's not important.

01:40:52.082 --> 01:40:53.641
I can't be shielded
like this, Jeremy.

01:40:53.717 --> 01:40:55.378
I need to know
what's going on around here.

01:40:55.452 --> 01:40:57.420
Dana cut a deal
with Chris Patrick's people.

01:40:57.487 --> 01:40:59.182
There aren't gonna be any
questions about what happened.

01:40:59.256 --> 01:41:00.587
And we get Mary Pat Shelby?

01:41:00.657 --> 01:41:02.682
-- Yeah.
-- Dana knows what she's doing.

01:41:02.759 --> 01:41:04.056
-- Yeah, she does.
-- Listen --

01:41:04.127 --> 01:41:05.390
-- Are you happy with that?
-- Yes.

01:41:05.462 --> 01:41:07.226
-- Natalie... forget about the show.
-- She did the smart thing.

01:41:07.297 --> 01:41:08.696
-- Look... -- She thinks
it's what you want.

01:41:08.765 --> 01:41:10.233
You can go to her right now,
Natalie.

01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.699
It wouldn't be
as bad as you think.

01:41:11.768 --> 01:41:12.667
Yes, it would.

01:41:12.736 --> 01:41:14.101

-- Yes, it would!

secret meetings
in Isaac's office,

01:41:18.108 --> 01:41:19.837
"We'll have a car
take you home"?

01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:21.400
I'm already out of the loop.

01:41:21.478 --> 01:41:23.572
-- It's just tonight.
-- No, it's not.

01:41:23.647 --> 01:41:24.739
This is a soundproof room,

01:41:24.815 --> 01:41:26.977
and I can still hear
the phones ringing out there.

01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:28.142
They're on the scent,

01:41:28.218 --> 01:41:29.743
and they're all calling
to talk to me.

01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:31.788
I have a journalism degree
from Northwestern.

01:41:31.855 --> 01:41:33.482
I started out
as a summer intern.

01:41:33.557 --> 01:41:35.423
I worked my way up
to senior associate.

01:41:35.492 --> 01:41:38.086
Tomorrow, I'd be
a cocktail-party joke.

01:41:38.161 --> 01:41:41.256
So it'd actually be
every bit as bad as I think.

01:41:41.331 --> 01:41:43.299
Yeah.

01:41:43.367 --> 01:41:46.530
If you don't mind,
I really have this work to do.

01:41:50.307 --> 01:41:52.366
Isn't there anything
I can do for you?

01:41:53.777 --> 01:41:54.938
No.

01:42:12.562 --> 01:42:13.654

the men's room.

01:42:16.066 --> 01:42:17.158
Down the hall to your right.

01:42:17.234 --> 01:42:19.202
Thanks.
Chris Patrick.

01:42:19.269 --> 01:42:22.261
Get your hand
out of my face.

01:42:22.339 --> 01:42:24.000
Did I say something funny?

[Inhales sharply]

01:42:32.516 --> 01:42:34.484
What, do you want to dance
with me, Junior?

01:42:34.551 --> 01:42:36.679
You touch her again,
I'm gonna have you killed.

01:42:36.753 --> 01:42:37.686
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

I'm gonna pay someone $50
to have you killed.

Well, let me tell you
something...Skippy.

01:42:42.993 --> 01:42:45.985
By the look in her eyes
when she got a load of me...

01:42:47.397 --> 01:42:49.456
...seemed pretty impressed.

Hey.

Hey.

01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:08.541
What are you doin'?

01:43:08.618 --> 01:43:11.451
There's just, uh...

01:43:12.923 --> 01:43:14.186
Nothing.

01:43:16.927 --> 01:43:20.955
The network says intend-to-view
tracking puts us in 4.2 million homes.

01:43:21.031 --> 01:43:22.897
It's a landslide.

01:43:22.966 --> 01:43:24.127
Hmm.

01:43:24.201 --> 01:43:26.602
Well, you're about to take us
into the big-time, Dana.

01:43:26.670 --> 01:43:28.331
<i>You deserve credit for that.</i>

01:43:33.076 --> 01:43:34.737
I sent her there on purpose.

01:43:36.747 --> 01:43:38.647
I sent her there
instead of Jeremy

01:43:38.715 --> 01:43:42.242
'cause I knew how Patrick felt
about women in a locker room,

01:43:42.319 --> 01:43:47.052
and I thought I could...
provoke a more...

01:43:47.124 --> 01:43:50.719

to the questions.

I know.

01:43:55.465 --> 01:43:57.934
Does she?
Does Natalie know?

01:43:59.169 --> 01:44:01.194
Of course she knows.

01:44:01.271 --> 01:44:03.467
She learned from you.

01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:08.535
It was the right thing to do.

01:44:08.612 --> 01:44:10.774
Does she know
that I sold her?

01:44:10.847 --> 01:44:13.646
Dana, Natalie wouldn't complain
if her hair were on fire.

01:44:13.717 --> 01:44:15.310
[Chuckles softly]

She wants what's best
for the show.

01:44:20.357 --> 01:44:22.451
And she knows that I know.

01:44:22.526 --> 01:44:24.255
What's that?

01:44:24.327 --> 01:44:25.795
That you tend to do
the right thing.

01:44:25.862 --> 01:44:27.626
[Voice breaking] Oh.

01:44:27.697 --> 01:44:29.324

Hey.

01:44:51.788 --> 01:44:52.914
How's your wrist?

01:44:52.989 --> 01:44:55.890
It's fine. My wrist is fine.
My wrist is fine.

01:44:55.959 --> 01:44:57.950
I know it's hard to think of
things to say to me right now,

01:44:58.028 --> 01:45:01.054
but if people would stop asking about
my wrist, I'd really appreciate it.

01:45:01.131 --> 01:45:02.758
My wrist is fine.

01:45:02.833 --> 01:45:04.164
Cool.

01:45:07.170 --> 01:45:08.660
Wait. [sighs]

-- Nothin'.

<i>You came in here
to say something.</i>

01:45:20.984 --> 01:45:22.247
I came in to ask you
about your wrist.

01:45:22.319 --> 01:45:24.253
-- No, you didn't.
-- It's what everybody's doing.

01:45:24.321 --> 01:45:26.722
-- You're not everybody.
-- I can work on that.

01:45:31.728 --> 01:45:34.425
[Sighing ] You came in to say
I shouldn't keep quiet.

01:45:34.497 --> 01:45:37.296
No. Actually, you caught me
on my day off.

01:45:37.367 --> 01:45:39.961
You're not gonna tell me
to be strong?

01:45:40.036 --> 01:45:42.164
It hasn't been my experience
that you need to be told that.

01:45:42.239 --> 01:45:46.142
We all remember a Boston <i>Globe</i>
reporter who was strong, Danny.

01:45:46.209 --> 01:45:48.109
There isn't
a female sports journalist

01:45:48.178 --> 01:45:50.442
that didn't learn
their lesson from it.

01:45:50.513 --> 01:45:51.639
I would imagine.

01:45:51.715 --> 01:45:53.149
She had death threats.

01:45:53.216 --> 01:45:55.082
The FBI had to open her mail.

01:45:55.151 --> 01:45:57.176
Every loser
who knew how to dial a phone

01:45:57.254 --> 01:45:59.655
is calling talk radio,
saying, "She was a bitch

01:45:59.723 --> 01:46:02.556
who shouldn't have been where
she was in the first place."

01:46:02.626 --> 01:46:03.787
And when it was all said
and done,

01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:07.125
she had to pack up her life and move
to the other side of the planet.

01:46:08.798 --> 01:46:10.823
Nat, I have
absolutely no problem

01:46:10.901 --> 01:46:12.562
with you going along with Dana
and taking a pass.

01:46:12.636 --> 01:46:13.728
Mm-hmm.

01:46:13.803 --> 01:46:16.204
The only reason
I came in here...

01:46:16.273 --> 01:46:18.002
was to tell you this --

01:46:18.074 --> 01:46:22.773
no matter what you decide...
you've got friends.

01:46:30.854 --> 01:46:33.118
And this is what friends
gear up for.

Uh...Jeremy!

-- Yes.
