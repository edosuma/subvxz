The legend of the ten rings

00:47.424 --> 00:50.093

01:05.316 --> 01:06.568
(HORSE GRUNTS)

01:10.113 --> 01:16.953
Some say he found the rings in a crater
or stole them from a tomb.

01:19.706 --> 01:22.542
They gave him the strength of a god,

01:22.709 --> 01:26.212
and the gift of eternal life.

(BREATHES SHAKILY)

for all the reasons
we all get picked on a lot.

11:41.577 --> 11:42.953

to the US,

11:43.037 --> 11:44.497
so I was struggling
with my English,

11:44.663 --> 11:45.748
and I was on my way
to lunch one day

who was like twice my size

drop his backpack,

all up in his face...

into the parking lot...

that she had also swiped
the keys to the guy's Mustang.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.988

was in the car, too.

never told me this story?

You know,
before she was a lawyer,

12:28.207 --> 12:29.458
your girl was pretty wild.

Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

12:37.258 --> 12:38.926
That maybe there's a point

12:39.009 --> 12:40.970
where you're supposed
to stop going on joyrides

12:41.137 --> 12:43.556
and start thinking about
living up to your potential.

Some years ago,
a terrorist from America

to live in Ta Lo.
