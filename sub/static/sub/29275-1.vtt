00:33.555 --> 00:36.427
May I have your attention,
please?

00:36.514 --> 00:39.691
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

00:39.778 --> 00:43.869
thank you all, for making this
such a memorable celebration.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.437
Now, to top off our night,

00:46.524 --> 00:49.179
Mr. Hingston's exquisite bride

00:49.266 --> 00:53.879
will serenade him with
a very special love song.

Sing it again!

02:15.439 --> 02:19.922
Thank you. I'm honored
by each and every one of you.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.142
Thank you, so very much.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.673
What a stunning bride.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.458
And what a stupendous wedding.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.641
Oh, there she is.
Over here.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.561
All, back to him now.

02:51.736 --> 02:54.130
If you'll excuse me,
a moment.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.266
Mr. Hingston is
expecting you upstairs.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.312
A husband shouldn't be
kept waiting any longer.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.971
Your daughter is the epitome
of Upper perfection.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.278
She's earned the life
ahead of her.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.323
You must be so very proud.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.195
Indeed.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.977
That place works miracles.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.460
You could be
so difficult, before.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.552
But now,

04:10.206 --> 04:13.383
It's as if that girl
never existed.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.212
What?

05:06.218 --> 05:07.872
Hello?

05:19.754 --> 05:22.278
Good morning, Uma.

05:22.365 --> 05:26.021
I didn't mean to startle you.
Breakfast is on its way.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.545
Breakfast?
Wait, where am I?

05:28.632 --> 05:30.808
You're in paradise, of course.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.524
- Mademoiselle!

06:01.970 --> 06:03.363
Uma!

06:03.450 --> 06:05.277
Mademoiselle!

06:06.714 --> 06:08.280
Uma!

06:09.978 --> 06:11.327
Uma!

06:24.906 --> 06:27.387
Uma! Uma!

06:44.447 --> 06:47.058
Uma!

06:57.721 --> 06:59.288
New in town?

06:59.375 --> 07:00.637
Look, I-I need help, OK?

07:00.724 --> 07:02.247
They're chasing me
and-and--

07:02.334 --> 07:03.858
and I need
somewhere to hide.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.686
I don't even know
how I got here.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.296
Come with me.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.254
Uma! Mademoiselle!

07:09.341 --> 07:11.039
Just come with me.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.699
Wh-what is this place?

07:18.786 --> 07:20.788
You lost something?

07:20.875 --> 07:22.964
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!

07:30.406 --> 07:32.539
Why won't you answer me?

07:34.715 --> 07:38.109

07:57.389 --> 08:00.131
♪ She asked her mother

08:31.554 --> 08:34.426
Excuse me, but,
who are you?

08:34.514 --> 08:39.214
Some people complain that
rose bushes have thorns.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.216
I rejoice that...

08:42.390 --> 08:45.220
thorn bushes have roses.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.048
What am I doing here?

08:47.135 --> 08:49.703
Honey, you have no reason
to be afraid.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.793
This is a center
for emotional healing.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.969
Holistic and sustained healing.

08:55.056 --> 08:58.799
Now, most of our girls
aren't quite so feisty
when they arrive,

08:58.886 --> 09:02.106
but I do understand
how difficult this must be
for you.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.326
Why can't I leave?

09:04.413 --> 09:08.069
Addressing
your anger issues,
is gonna take a while.

09:08.156 --> 09:12.377
Sweetheart, they told me
you lost control again,
last night.

09:12.464 --> 09:15.685
You can tell my mother,
that she is wasting her time.

09:18.166 --> 09:22.605
This is an opportunity, Uma.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.781
Relax.
Thank you.

09:24.868 --> 09:27.305
Observe your life
from a new perspective.

09:27.392 --> 09:30.004
And whose perspective
is that? Yours?

09:30.091 --> 09:31.962
And what about mine?

09:32.049 --> 09:34.356
You'll be with us
for two months.

09:34.443 --> 09:37.141
All I ask in that time,
is you keep an open mind,

09:37.228 --> 09:40.492
and, reconsider
your marriage proposal,

09:40.580 --> 09:42.451
after your stay.

10:01.296 --> 10:04.255
Luggage was arranged
by your mother, mademoiselle.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.693
Do you all talk like that?

10:08.433 --> 10:10.087
Hey!

10:10.174 --> 10:12.481
-Well, it's about time,
darling.
-Uh...

10:12.568 --> 10:14.701
Hi.
Rough trip?

10:14.788 --> 10:17.268
Actually, I don't
remember any of it.

10:17.355 --> 10:18.835
Oh, well, lucky you,

10:18.922 --> 10:20.663
because that seaplane
was sketchier

10:20.750 --> 10:22.360
than a broke-ass
roller coaster.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.101
-Sea plane?
-Yeah.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.625
I'm Chloe.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.061
Uma.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.845
That's Yu.

10:28.932 --> 10:31.326
I don't reckon she's
too keen on being here.

10:31.413 --> 10:32.980
What, and you are?

10:33.067 --> 10:36.374
Well, if it'll get my parents
off my back.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.202
What's their problem?

10:38.289 --> 10:40.770
They think two months here
is gonna turn me into

10:40.857 --> 10:43.033
some skinny pageant queen,
like my sisters.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.732
It won't, because I'm fine
just the way I am.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.560
But, hey, I'll take
a free vacation.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.562
Yu.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.260
-Yu!
-What?

10:52.347 --> 10:53.957
Meet Uma.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.046
-Hi.
-They told me
no roommates.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.875
Well, hey, that's not
our fault, girl.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.703
And don't touch
my stuff.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.316
Let's dress for dinner, ladies.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.883
OK.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.169
Where's the rest of it?

11:32.256 --> 11:34.694
Our diet is
individually calibrated

11:34.781 --> 11:38.262
for your optimum
physical health and
your mental equilibrium.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.527
Eh, uh, I can't because, um,

11:42.614 --> 11:45.313
I'm, uh, uh,
la-lactose intolerant?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.533
Allergies and intolerances
have been dutifully
accounted for,

11:48.620 --> 11:52.233
-and, mademoiselle,
dairy is not one of yours.
-OK, fine, whatever.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.365
We kindly ask you
to finish all of your dinner,

11:54.452 --> 11:57.586
to have sufficient nourishment
for tomorrow's activities.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.502
Bon appétit, mademoiselles.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.079
You know her?

12:12.166 --> 12:13.689
No.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.039
She screwed me over,
as soon as I got here.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.694
-What?

12:18.781 --> 12:20.740

12:35.711 --> 12:37.974
Yeah, her new sound
is real neat.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.933
-She's also--
- A drunk.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.674
- That's not nice.
-It's true.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.069
Look, I hear her parents
are super conservative,

12:46.156 --> 12:48.680
and they've got her in detox,
before they drag her back home.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.726
You know, it really
must not be easy

12:50.813 --> 12:53.163
-being famous.
- Yeah, it's so not easy
being famous.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.862
Think about the pressure.
No wonder she drinks.

12:55.949 --> 12:58.995
- She's kind of tragic.
- Don't judge her.

13:14.358 --> 13:17.492
-What do you want?

13:17.579 --> 13:19.276
Still mad about this morning?

13:19.363 --> 13:21.017
Ya think?

13:21.104 --> 13:23.063
Well, they were gonna
catch you, either way,

13:23.150 --> 13:25.500
and I couldn't let them
find our cave.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.548
"Our cave?"

13:30.635 --> 13:32.246
Course. Where else
are you gonna

13:32.333 --> 13:34.378
light up my cigarettes
for me, hmm?

13:40.384 --> 13:42.386
Hey...

13:42.473 --> 13:45.563
Please don't believe
everything you hear about me.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.871
I don't even drink, anymore.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.874
Then, why are you here?

13:51.961 --> 13:54.355
Well...

13:54.442 --> 13:57.401
I wanted to do music
in my own voice.

13:57.488 --> 14:00.622
My team freaked out.

14:00.709 --> 14:04.452
You see, they look at me
like a product.

14:04.539 --> 14:07.237
They planted all those
partying stories about me,

14:07.324 --> 14:09.674
and sent me here,

14:09.761 --> 14:12.721
to rehab for it, I guess.

14:12.808 --> 14:14.549
Why haven't you
tried to escape?

14:14.636 --> 14:16.943
-Escape from what?
-I don't know, exactly, but,

14:17.030 --> 14:19.075
I'm not trying
to get brainwashed here.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.425
Well, the only thing we've done
till now is a lot of yoga

14:21.512 --> 14:23.340
-and feeling our feelings.
-I don't care.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.255
I'm getting out of here.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.083
Well, I don't know how
you think you're gonna do that,

14:27.170 --> 14:29.520
because we're on an island
in the middle of the ocean.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.044
Tonight.

14:33.785 --> 14:37.137
OK. I'll help you.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.705
Meet me outside my room.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.969
Midnight.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.539
Hey.

14:51.064 --> 14:54.197
-How do you get cigarettes?

14:54.284 --> 14:56.634
An attendant gives them to me.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.507
His daughter's a fan.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.074
I video chat with her.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.992
You know, Uma,

There's always a way

I, actually, fell asleep, too.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.473
Mademoiselle.

Please confirm
your chosen look.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.009
Hell, yes.

Oh, no. No, no.
I've got to--

Please, mademoiselle.

It isn't me.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.810
Mommy's perfect little Upper.

17:09.897 --> 17:12.335
You don't have to change
who you are, Uma.

17:15.685 --> 17:19.560
Relax, Uma. This'll
only take a minute.

17:19.646 --> 17:21.344
-Ow!

17:25.044 --> 17:26.828
-Ow.

Please sit still,
mademoiselle.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.573
-Ow!

17:58.164 --> 18:00.166
It's like looking
at somebody else.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.776
Yeah.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.953
Someone I don't like.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.526
Dearest.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.702
How are you
adjusting, honey?

18:14.789 --> 18:18.009
Great. I've always
wanted to go to
a fascist boarding school,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.838
so, this is kind of
a dream come true.

18:20.925 --> 18:24.190
Well, I certainly hope
we can change that for you.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.540
Please sit,
and face the mirror.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.151
Please, sit down.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.898
Uma, I know you think
this isn't the place for you,

18:36.985 --> 18:38.639
and you may be right,

18:38.726 --> 18:41.598
But I'm asking you to be
the tiniest bit receptive--

18:41.685 --> 18:43.122
To your propaganda?

18:51.869 --> 18:55.177
We are at our best,
when we are truly ourselves.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.049
Can we agree on that?

18:58.137 --> 19:02.228
Mirror Therapy is about
owning your story.

19:02.315 --> 19:06.101
It's about remembering
what makes you, you.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.234
Only the things
that you would know.

19:09.670 --> 19:13.413
Tell yourself the story
of who you truly are.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.981
You want me
to talk to myself?

19:17.068 --> 19:20.159
Well, you don't seem
to enjoy talking to me.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.944
How about this?

19:23.031 --> 19:24.380
I'll ask you a question.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.340
Answer only if
you want to, OK?

19:29.342 --> 19:31.909
What was the one thing
your mother never gave you?

19:31.996 --> 19:33.128
What?

19:33.215 --> 19:35.086
Try and look in the mirror.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.829
Does she look after you?

19:38.916 --> 19:41.005
She looks after herself.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.530
-You're very tough on her.
-She deserves it.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.359
-Do you love her?
-What are you trying to do here?

19:46.446 --> 19:49.231
OK, I am not gonna
marry that prick.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.239
It's hard to find a good man
in this world, Uma.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.286
I would know.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.175
Keep it up, mademoiselles.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.483
Control of the body,
clarity of the mind.

20:25.180 --> 20:29.053
All right. And work
in pairs now, please.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.884
Yu.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.323
-Come on.
-No.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.716
I need a partner.

20:43.372 --> 20:44.721
Assume.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.419
-And forward.
- Come on.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.029
I can't do this on my own.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.944
Come on.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.686
And back.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.431
And forward.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.741
And back.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.529
Forward.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.580
And back.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.418
And back.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.290
Uma? Uma.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.118
Are you still with us?

21:34.205 --> 21:36.425
Yeah, sorry.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.819
OK.

21:38.906 --> 21:41.169
And forward.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.522
And back.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.633
Your gloves, please.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.074
It's a little tight.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.773
It's for your safety.
Please.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.756
Sorry about that. We're, uh,

22:46.843 --> 22:49.106
we're attempting to resolve
some technical issues.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.370
Please, hang tight.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.029
Lowers like to

22:59.116 --> 23:01.597
say all kinds of things
about me,

23:02.816 --> 23:03.991
but the truth is,

23:04.078 --> 23:05.558
I'm a simple man.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.126
I work hard,

23:10.954 --> 23:12.652
and I give back.

23:16.612 --> 23:19.267
I may be a sensitive guy,

23:21.008 --> 23:22.749
but don't let
anyone tell you,

23:22.836 --> 23:25.447
I don't know how
to have a good time.

23:27.928 --> 23:31.758
Maybe my idea of fun
can be a bit extreme,

23:33.194 --> 23:35.457
but, in both
business and life,

23:36.806 --> 23:39.113
what's the point
of dreaming small?

23:45.859 --> 23:46.990
Lowers like to say

23:47.077 --> 23:48.905
all kinds of
things about me,

23:48.992 --> 23:51.647
-OK, I get it.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.433
I'm a simple man.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.826
-I get it!
- I work hard,

23:56.913 --> 23:58.828
-and I give back.
-Hello?

23:58.915 --> 24:01.570
But the truth is...
-Turn it off?

24:01.657 --> 24:03.616
...simple man--

24:03.703 --> 24:07.707
I work hard--
But the truth is--

24:16.846 --> 24:18.500
...simple man--
But--

24:18.587 --> 24:20.720
Maybe my idea of fun

24:20.807 --> 24:23.287
can be a bit extreme.

24:23.374 --> 24:28.031
I may be a sensitive guy.
I may be a sensitive guy.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.903
...sensitive guy.

25:00.324 --> 25:03.110
We're so sorry,
the system failed.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.504
We couldn't stop
the projection remotely.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.723
The infirmary
will patch those up.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.812
We're so sorry.

25:21.041 --> 25:25.045
You really think that
stupid video is gonna
get me to change my mind?

25:25.132 --> 25:29.266
Oh, honey. Let me
take a look at those hands.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.834
Come here.

25:33.401 --> 25:36.186
Perhaps he is
a bit heavy-handed.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.147
But he means well.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.323
"Means well?"

25:42.410 --> 25:44.978
He's a sociopath.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.502
-Besides, it doesn't matter.

25:47.589 --> 25:50.636
I'm in love
with somebody else.

25:50.723 --> 25:53.160
Your mother never told me
about anyone else.

25:53.247 --> 25:54.640
Of course not.
He's a Lower,

25:54.727 --> 25:56.729
so, he basically
doesn't exist to her.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.429
Your father was not
a good influence, Uma.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.174
Look at me.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.481
I have dedicated my whole life

26:10.569 --> 26:13.136
to taking care of
Mother's little garden.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.878
But you, if you could
learn your place,

26:15.965 --> 26:19.273
you have your
best years ahead of you.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.231
Don't end up like me.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.370
So sad!

26:29.457 --> 26:32.025
Would you like to help me
clip some thorns?

26:44.298 --> 26:47.693
So, your ma just likes him
because he's rich?

26:49.042 --> 26:51.784
She's an Upper,
but we're broke.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.613
She thinks the marriage
will save our family.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.704
That sucks.
I'm sorry, dude.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.447
Am I the only one
getting married off, here?

27:04.971 --> 27:07.103
I wish all I had to do
was marry some rich guy.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.149
You don't mean that.

27:09.236 --> 27:11.281
Well, my video was people

27:11.368 --> 27:13.893
just jogging and eating,
like, celery.

27:13.980 --> 27:17.244
I mean, if it was that easy,
everyone would look like
Amarna.

27:17.331 --> 27:20.247
Why, thank you, Chloe.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.338
Screw this.

27:24.425 --> 27:28.342
No, hey.
Here, let me help.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.736
I can't do this.
I-I just can't.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.389
No.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.526
What'd they show you
in there?

27:38.613 --> 27:40.702
It was a documentary
about my thing.

27:42.051 --> 27:46.142
I get anxious.
Like, panic-attack anxious.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.754
I feel like I'm dying,
when I have one.

27:50.538 --> 27:52.496
My parents are Lowers.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.238
They sent me to Beijing
to live with my aunt and uncle.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.893
Big shot Uppers, but...

27:57.980 --> 28:00.243
I just don't know
how to act around them.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.116
I don't know how to be.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.423
I embarrass them.

28:08.512 --> 28:09.992
So, they sent me here,

28:10.079 --> 28:13.561
told me not to come back
until I got better.

28:13.648 --> 28:16.738
Hey, you're not like
the other Lowers.

28:16.825 --> 28:18.871
You got a choice now.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.829
Yeah, well, maybe
my idea of success,

28:20.916 --> 28:24.877
isn't stepping on
everyone below me.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.618
There, there,
my little tapioca pudding.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.969
You're in our
brave new world now.

28:30.056 --> 28:32.667
We know you've suffered,
my peanut,

28:32.754 --> 28:35.626
but don't you worry.
You most surely will be
redeemed,

28:35.714 --> 28:39.108
by an excellent
hairstyle and a truly
mediocre personality.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.283
I hate you guys.

28:41.632 --> 28:42.982
Come on.

28:43.069 --> 28:44.418
Hey.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.770
So when you go back
to Beijing,

28:48.857 --> 28:50.076
you're gonna form what?

28:50.163 --> 28:51.642
Uh, Sammy.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.427
Sammy and the
Decapitated Head Horses.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.734
-Charming.
-Wait, who's Sammy?

28:55.821 --> 28:58.432
I'm Sammy.
I formed the band, so...

28:58.519 --> 29:00.347
Wait, you're singing?

29:01.261 --> 29:03.002
Uh, Amarna sings.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.655
I do this...

29:06.657 --> 29:08.659
That ain't music!

29:08.747 --> 29:11.271
♪ Yeah, Chloe doesn't like it
Thinks it's too crass ♪

29:11.358 --> 29:14.100
♪ She don't know shit
Got her head up her ass ♪

29:14.187 --> 29:16.624
-Real funny.
- Give me my headphones.

29:28.941 --> 29:32.161
My dearests...
the sun is rising.

29:58.971 --> 30:02.191
She visited me
the first time the album
went platinum.

30:03.845 --> 30:07.370
We went swimming.
Just the two of us.

30:07.457 --> 30:10.504
It was a beautiful,
clear day, but...

30:11.810 --> 30:14.508
the current was
just too strong.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.640
I told her I was not
gonna leave with her.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.556
I was gonna stay.

30:22.255 --> 30:25.649
She said, "Whatever you want,
I want for you."

30:25.736 --> 30:28.348
She started getting
pulled under the waves.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.873
I, uh...

30:31.960 --> 30:35.268
I, uh, managed
to get her back to shore.

30:35.355 --> 30:38.314
And I just wrapped my arms
around her.

30:38.401 --> 30:39.925
I wish she meant it.

30:42.797 --> 30:45.626
I wish she meant it,
with every part of my life.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.498
I was terrified of losing her.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.937
Terrified of just being...

30:52.024 --> 30:54.504
completely alone.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.289
But at that time...

30:57.551 --> 30:59.335
those words were just...

31:01.511 --> 31:04.079
enough.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.038
That was the last time
I told her I loved her.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.648
...I told her I loved her.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.174
Very good, Uma.

31:12.261 --> 31:14.481
I'm proud of you.

31:20.443 --> 31:23.751
Nice. Now you twist the
ends together, like this.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.884
When I leave this place...

31:25.971 --> 31:27.668
I'm gonna go

31:27.755 --> 31:30.279
somewhere far,
far away from here.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.283
I just want to be somewhere,
where I can...

31:35.458 --> 31:38.287
start all over again.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.550
where nobody really knows
who I am.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.127
What about you?

31:53.955 --> 31:56.958
I told you,
I'm in love with someone.

31:58.742 --> 32:01.136
We just want to be together...

32:01.223 --> 32:03.138
and have a simple life.

32:08.187 --> 32:12.191
Uma, isn't that
a memory locket?

32:12.278 --> 32:15.107
It's the prototype
for all the rest.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.957
They still make them?

32:43.048 --> 32:45.833
Not the way my dad used to.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.700
How did you...?

33:28.136 --> 33:30.704
I promised I'd find you.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.582
How did you even find me?

33:39.669 --> 33:42.020
Showed up at
your mother's place.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.109
She was not happy to see me.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.024
What did she say?

33:46.111 --> 33:48.548
That you were getting ready
to marry Son.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.854
But I'm not marrying him.
I told her that--

33:50.941 --> 33:53.205
I know, I know. Shh, shh.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.039
I applied for the job,
as soon as I could.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.563
Listen, Uma,

34:03.650 --> 34:06.044
I'm gonna get you
off this island.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.527
No. Not here.

34:30.371 --> 34:32.331
Swiped this
from the tech guys.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.463
The feed will just show
an empty room,

34:34.550 --> 34:36.639
same as before.

34:39.467 --> 34:40.860
Listen...

34:45.257 --> 34:47.128
I'm gonna
join the cargo crew.

34:47.215 --> 34:49.391
When I do,
I'll sneak you into the hold.

34:49.478 --> 34:52.916
We'll fly to the mainland
and I'll get you
off that plane.

34:53.003 --> 34:55.092
An-and go where?

34:55.179 --> 34:57.138
We'll figure it out.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.835
As long as we're together.

35:03.362 --> 35:06.147

I mean, he came
all this way for you?

35:44.577 --> 35:47.536
Just in time
to save you from that shit
you're supposed to marry.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.277
Uma doesn't need saving.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.673
He's gonna help me escape.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.893
You just have to be
nice to the staff,
fake the treatments.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.331
You don't need to escape.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.376
I finally have a partner
in all of this.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.032
And what am I?

36:07.991 --> 36:10.385
You shouldn't
trust that guy, Uma.

36:10.472 --> 36:12.953
Wh--
I've known him, my entire life.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.608

he deserves you.

37:36.689 --> 37:38.212
Bedtime, mademoiselles.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.258
No.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.131
Off stage. Go.

37:45.785 --> 37:48.440
Listen, I don't want to
repeat it. Just, go.

38:27.130 --> 38:29.698
Just once,

38:29.785 --> 38:33.311
can she play some shit
that isn't, like,
a hundred years old?

38:41.057 --> 38:44.496
-Have you seen my necklace?
My locket?
- No.

38:59.511 --> 39:03.253
Security perimeter breach.
Security perimeter breach...

39:03.341 --> 39:07.170
-Interfering boat type
zero-zero-one-two...
- Look at these clowns.

39:07.257 --> 39:11.087
Male subject. All safety
personnel to Beach A-Three...

39:11.174 --> 39:13.873
Interns are to initiate
regular morning activities...

39:13.960 --> 39:18.225
-Security instructions will...
-Girls! The showers. Now!

39:18.312 --> 39:19.966
Come on, mademoiselles.
Move it!

39:20.053 --> 39:22.098
Please,
resume standard procedures.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.797
We repeat.
Please, resume stan...

39:24.884 --> 39:26.625
...to Beach A-Three...

39:26.712 --> 39:28.627
We repeat, perimeter breach...

39:28.714 --> 39:31.760
-What's that boat doing here?
-No clue.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.545
We repeat,
perimeter breach...

39:33.632 --> 39:36.548
It's unacceptable.
Who is this intruder?

39:36.635 --> 39:38.941
Fetch him.
Fetch him at once!

39:39.028 --> 39:41.030
Why are you still here?
Go wash yourselves!

39:41.117 --> 39:43.381
-Whose boat is that?
-Are you deaf?

39:43.468 --> 39:45.600
Well, I was just asking
whose boat--

39:45.687 --> 39:47.907
-OK, get out of here. Go, go!
-Hey, hey!

39:47.994 --> 39:49.430
Hey! Back off!

39:52.346 --> 39:55.131
-What did you say?
-I said, back off.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.875
- Yu!
- Mademoiselle!

40:01.094 --> 40:04.358
Don't you ever touch me again.

40:06.099 --> 40:09.189
I will send you home
to your family, a failure,

40:09.276 --> 40:10.625
a disgrace.

40:10.712 --> 40:11.974
Is that what you want?

40:12.061 --> 40:13.149
Is it?

40:15.848 --> 40:17.023
Enough.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.503
Stop.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.811
I said stop!

40:22.898 --> 40:25.553
If she leaves, we all leave.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.600
You hear me?

40:28.687 --> 40:30.993
Yeah. We'll tell
everybody about this.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.127
I am so sorry.

40:34.214 --> 40:36.085
I lost my composure.

40:36.172 --> 40:39.349
We are dealing with
a situation this morning.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.352
Thank you so much,
for helping me.
Um, find him.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.964
And turn off this...
ridiculous alarm.

40:45.051 --> 40:47.706
It's OK. Just breathe,
just breathe, just breathe.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.011
It's OK.

40:51.797 --> 40:54.234
- Look, there he is.
- The mystery man.

40:54.321 --> 40:57.411
He ran into the rocks,
like he wanted to crash.

40:57.498 --> 41:00.283
She interrogated him, herself.
I can't even imagine.

41:00.370 --> 41:03.243
I heard he came to see Amarna.
He demanded an audience.

41:03.330 --> 41:05.593
- Superfan.
- Super creep.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.816
So the attendant
that gets me cigs

41:10.903 --> 41:13.558
lets me use his station
in exchange for passes
to my comeback show.

41:13.645 --> 41:16.038
That guy sailed
all the way here to see you?

41:16.125 --> 41:17.649
Not exactly.

41:18.693 --> 41:20.565
Holy shit.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.654
That's what he really
came to do.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.397
-How?
- Uma,

41:27.485 --> 41:29.182
there's no stalker.

41:29.269 --> 41:31.010
It was all a front.

41:31.097 --> 41:32.968
My admirer
stashed the rowboat here,

41:33.055 --> 41:35.275
and sailed around
the island all night,

41:35.362 --> 41:38.060
but nobody
spotted him till dawn.

41:40.062 --> 41:42.369
They're not guarding
the coast at night.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.458
That's our way out of here.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.025
We come here after dinner,

41:46.112 --> 41:48.027
we get on the rowboat,
and we go to shore.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.769
It's only ten miles.
We can do it. Uma.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.383
Please.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.777
I thought you didn't
want to leave at all.

41:58.864 --> 42:00.735
What's changed?

42:06.915 --> 42:08.874
Last night, I was
able to stay awake,

42:08.961 --> 42:11.485
for the first time
since we've been here.

42:12.878 --> 42:14.314
You know why?

42:15.794 --> 42:19.798
Because,
I didn't drink the milk.

42:19.885 --> 42:21.713
They've been drugging us,
every night.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.802
They make us sleep
like we're dead.

42:26.369 --> 42:28.763
But, the Residence
isn't sleeping.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.897
Where did you find this?

42:31.984 --> 42:33.986
It was in the patio,
by the mermaid.

42:34.073 --> 42:36.292
There was staff
that I didn't recognize,

42:36.379 --> 42:38.120
wheeling
passed-out girls around.

42:38.991 --> 42:41.080
What?!

42:41.167 --> 42:42.298
Listen, we have to go.

42:42.385 --> 42:43.561
Tonight.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.737
We don't drink our milk,

42:45.824 --> 42:47.652
and we meet here,
after curfew.

42:47.739 --> 42:49.001
I have to tell Markus.

42:49.088 --> 42:50.872
No, Uma, you can't.

42:50.959 --> 42:53.309
I can't disappear
on him, again.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.059
OK.

43:06.018 --> 43:09.369
Just... don't give him
any details.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.855
Listen.

43:16.942 --> 43:19.858
They're gonna transfer me
to the cargo crew tomorrow.

43:19.945 --> 43:23.165
We'll be out of here in
a couple of weeks, maybe less.

43:26.081 --> 43:28.562
Wow, don't get too excited.

43:29.476 --> 43:31.173
Uh, I am. It's just...

43:31.260 --> 43:32.827
What?

43:37.832 --> 43:40.400
I have to
tell you something.

44:02.030 --> 44:04.206
Mesdemoiselles,
your attention, please.

44:05.512 --> 44:07.166
Once, in a blue moon,

44:07.253 --> 44:10.125
a resident is so receptive
to what we offer,

44:10.212 --> 44:12.911
that she's ready to
rejoin her loved ones,

44:12.998 --> 44:15.478
sooner than expected.

44:17.219 --> 44:20.135
And, so it is, with our own...

44:21.659 --> 44:23.965
Amarna.

44:24.052 --> 44:26.576
We shouldn't be sad to
see her leave us this evening.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.449
We should instead,
let our hearts swell with joy,

44:29.536 --> 44:32.408
at the strong young woman,
Amarna has become,

44:32.495 --> 44:34.149
during her time here.

44:34.236 --> 44:35.847
To Amarna.

45:32.599 --> 45:34.949
-Uma. Uma.

45:35.036 --> 45:36.255
Listen to me, OK?

45:38.561 --> 45:43.001
You take that boat
with Markus. It's yours.

45:44.306 --> 45:46.265
But, how will I find you?

45:55.013 --> 45:56.318
What?

46:04.239 --> 46:05.763
Hey.

46:08.548 --> 46:11.377
You promise, right?

46:13.553 --> 46:15.033
I promise.

46:32.267 --> 46:33.878
I'll see you there, OK?

46:33.965 --> 46:37.098
Amarna? Time to go.

46:37.185 --> 46:40.928
Yeah.
I, uh, I'm coming.

46:50.982 --> 46:52.722
Be safe.

47:29.063 --> 47:31.544
Yeah, it is ugly.

48:17.807 --> 48:19.157
What the hell?

48:19.244 --> 48:21.507
How did she get
all the way over here?

48:24.292 --> 48:26.338
The sedative's slow sometimes.

48:26.425 --> 48:28.514
Hits them on the way
to the bathroom.

48:28.601 --> 48:31.299
- Are we
taking her to the OR?
- No.

48:31.386 --> 48:32.822
It's not her turn tonight.

48:57.717 --> 48:59.414
What's up with you?

48:59.501 --> 49:01.068
I'm fine.

49:01.155 --> 49:03.723
Yeah? 'Cause you're
scaring the mirror.

49:03.810 --> 49:06.334
I just had weird dreams
last night.

49:06.421 --> 49:10.121
Really? I ain't never
had a dream here.

49:36.016 --> 49:39.324
♪ Sad was the time ♪

49:39.411 --> 49:42.762
♪ I lived my whole life ♪

49:42.849 --> 49:46.505
♪ I lived my whole life ♪

49:46.592 --> 49:52.163

50:08.918 --> 50:12.357
The beloved artisan apparently
took his own life last night.

50:12.444 --> 50:16.535
Financially ruined
by the hostile takeover
of his family-owned business.

50:16.622 --> 50:18.711
...orchestrated the purchase...

50:18.798 --> 50:21.235
Stop! Turn it off!

50:21.322 --> 50:23.411
...costly legal battle...

50:23.498 --> 50:25.631
-Turn it off!

50:25.718 --> 50:28.068
and automated the factory.

50:28.155 --> 50:30.070
Let me down!

50:30.157 --> 50:32.072
Of course. I've made
the necessary arrangements.

50:32.159 --> 50:34.031
Let me out of here!

50:34.118 --> 50:35.771
Let me down!

50:36.598 --> 50:37.991
Turn it off!

50:47.740 --> 50:49.872
This place is a fucking lie!

50:49.959 --> 50:53.224
What are you doing to us?
What are you doing to us?

50:56.227 --> 50:59.230
Mademoiselle, stop!

50:59.317 --> 51:00.927
No, stop it!
You're lying to us!

51:01.014 --> 51:03.408
-Why are you lying to us?
-Mademoiselle, be still!

51:03.495 --> 51:05.714
Uma!
Where are you taking her?

51:05.801 --> 51:08.891
-Yu!
-We don't wish to
hurt you mademoiselle.

51:08.978 --> 51:10.458
Please!

51:12.895 --> 51:16.073
Markus!
Help me!

51:39.748 --> 51:41.707
Easy, Uma.

51:48.192 --> 51:49.497
Sit.

51:55.677 --> 51:56.939
Finish it.

52:04.469 --> 52:06.775
Why don't you drink me?

52:59.306 --> 53:00.829
Good morning, Uma.

53:01.656 --> 53:03.310
What's going on?

53:03.963 --> 53:05.182
What?

53:05.269 --> 53:06.835
Ow. No, no, no!

53:07.401 --> 53:09.447
Let me go!

53:45.918 --> 53:48.225
Over here, over here!

54:04.937 --> 54:07.069
How about a kiss?

54:49.808 --> 54:51.375
Well,

54:52.245 --> 54:53.812
isn't that a pickle?

54:54.900 --> 54:57.903
You think this place is a lie.

54:57.990 --> 55:01.036
Look at your friend.

55:01.123 --> 55:05.214
Her treatment seems
rather effective in the end,
don't you think?

55:05.302 --> 55:10.350
I think both her label
and her family will be very,
very pleased with the result.

55:11.569 --> 55:14.267
Oh, you gotta see this.

55:15.399 --> 55:18.532
This is what Son paid

55:18.619 --> 55:22.101
to have you...
skip our waiting list.

55:23.189 --> 55:24.625
Do you think
he would spend

55:24.712 --> 55:26.975
so much money on
something that doesn't work?

55:30.501 --> 55:32.372
Understand this.

55:32.459 --> 55:34.505
The therapy is real.

55:35.941 --> 55:38.944
You're just
a prickly little pear.

55:40.032 --> 55:42.077
And now you're done.

55:42.164 --> 55:43.862
What are you talking about?

55:43.949 --> 55:45.820
Oh, we're nearly finished
with you, Uma.

55:45.907 --> 55:48.867
By tomorrow you'll be able
to leave here forever.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.523
Tomorrow?

55:52.610 --> 55:54.351
Frankly, I thought
you'd be happier.

55:54.438 --> 55:57.528
I was under the impression
you couldn't wait to go.

55:57.615 --> 55:59.225
How long have I been asleep?

55:59.312 --> 56:02.010
How long have you
been asleep...

56:02.097 --> 56:04.404
Two weeks.

56:12.064 --> 56:13.848
Run along now, little bug.

56:14.806 --> 56:16.373
Your friends miss you.

56:29.908 --> 56:32.258
- Sure you're OK?
- Yes.

56:32.345 --> 56:35.174
They told us you went nuts,
that you broke that damn horse.

56:35.261 --> 56:37.176
-Is that true?
-OK, forget about all that.

56:37.263 --> 56:40.745
The Amarna we said goodbye to
is not the Amarna I saw on TV.

56:41.920 --> 56:44.139
They did something to her.

56:44.226 --> 56:45.227
And I'm not waiting around

56:45.314 --> 56:46.881
for them to do it to me.

56:49.580 --> 56:51.364
I'm leaving.

56:51.451 --> 56:53.453
And I want you two
to come with me.

56:56.282 --> 56:59.024
-How?
- Tonight.

56:59.111 --> 57:01.418
We throw up our milk,
we sneak out of the Residence,

57:01.505 --> 57:03.594
and we row this frickin' boat
to the mainland.

57:03.681 --> 57:05.552
And then what? I can't
go home until I'm cured.

57:05.639 --> 57:07.249
My aunt and uncle
will throw me out.

57:07.336 --> 57:08.512
So don't go home.

57:10.427 --> 57:11.645
What do you mean?

57:15.083 --> 57:16.433
I know somewhere else.

57:17.608 --> 57:19.174
Somewhere safe.

57:20.262 --> 57:22.743
Look, our families
sent us here

57:22.830 --> 57:24.702
to shape us
in their image.

57:24.789 --> 57:26.312
Not ours.

57:27.705 --> 57:28.967
I'm not doing it.

57:35.277 --> 57:36.583
Are you with me?

57:41.849 --> 57:43.416
Screw 'em.

57:48.116 --> 57:49.378
Come with us.

57:51.424 --> 57:52.556
I can't.

57:55.167 --> 57:57.343
It's OK.

57:57.430 --> 57:58.866
But we'll be waiting
for you tonight

57:58.953 --> 58:00.172
if you change your mind.

58:00.955 --> 58:01.956
Yeah.

58:07.614 --> 58:09.268
It's my fault.

58:09.355 --> 58:11.400
I should have tried to
join the crew sooner--

58:11.488 --> 58:12.924
It's only three more days.

58:14.534 --> 58:17.842
Listen. I will be on
the next plane out next week.

58:17.929 --> 58:19.931
I'll meet you on the mainland.

58:20.018 --> 58:24.239
And I swear I--
I will never let anything
tear us apart again.

58:28.287 --> 58:30.245
-OK.
-Yeah?

58:34.032 --> 58:35.903
I'll wait for you.

58:55.444 --> 58:58.796
Mademoiselle, finish
your dinner, please.

59:24.299 --> 59:26.563
I-I gotta take a leak.

59:38.749 --> 59:40.446
Yu!

59:49.542 --> 59:51.849
I'm not the one
that needs to change.

01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:10.607
Ready?

01:00:25.752 --> 01:00:28.755
These girls are
supposed to be completed.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.323
She's done.

01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:33.978
She's done.

01:00:36.023 --> 01:00:38.591
Wait, this one's still got
one session left.

01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:42.595
OK, let's get to it.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.116
-What do we do?

01:01:25.203 --> 01:01:28.206
We can't leave her behind.
Come on.

01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:42.524
-That way.
-OK.

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.779
Head right, huh?

01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:15.792
Let's go.

01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:23.364
First off, your boat's
a piece of shit.

01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:25.976
Damn, it's not fair.

01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:29.414
Secondly, you got
zero patience.

01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:31.503
Wait.

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:33.374
We gotta update the log.

01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:35.376
Ah, jeez.

01:03:35.463 --> 01:03:38.249
Can we wait till
after dinner? I'm starving.

01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:40.642
Let's just get it
over with, huh?

01:03:40.729 --> 01:03:42.557
Fine.

01:03:42.644 --> 01:03:44.777
You say I've got no patience.

01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:46.997
You're the one who
always gotta eat so bad.

01:04:01.576 --> 01:04:04.449
We'll do a full modeling
of her vocal chords

01:04:04.536 --> 01:04:08.235
as well as a scan
of the pupil and the iris.

01:04:08.322 --> 01:04:09.889
Yo, isn't she roommates
with that fat Southern girl?

01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:11.760
I think so. Why?

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.937
Don't know. I kinda
like that one.

01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:16.200
I feel sorry for her, though.

01:04:16.287 --> 01:04:18.289
What about ones you don't like?

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:20.552
You don't feel sorry for them?

01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:22.554
Yo, if I felt sorry
for all of them

01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:24.599
this job would be
un-freakin-bearable.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.865
-Chloe!
-Let her go, douche-canoes!

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:31.258
Christ, man, call her!

01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:33.434
What is it?

01:04:33.521 --> 01:04:35.654
Two girls are awake.
They're here in the OR.

01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:38.570
- Who?
-Mademoiselle Yu's roommates.
She's also awake.

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:40.267
Do I need to hold your hand?

01:04:40.354 --> 01:04:42.226
They're completed.
Finish them off!

01:04:43.401 --> 01:04:44.793
-No!

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:49.102
Chloe!

01:04:49.189 --> 01:04:51.061
We might need
some help here. Ow!

01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:58.590
Uma!

01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:00.244
Yu!

01:05:07.294 --> 01:05:09.209
Yu! Yu, breathe!

01:05:34.582 --> 01:05:36.019
Ow!

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:56.691
Easy, sweethear--

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:00.782
Yu!

01:06:01.392 --> 01:06:02.741
Yu. Yu.

01:06:02.828 --> 01:06:05.135
Yu, Yu, Yu, Yu.

01:06:05.222 --> 01:06:07.354
It's OK, it's OK.

01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:08.660
Here, I got you.

01:06:08.747 --> 01:06:10.357
Here. Here.

01:06:11.663 --> 01:06:13.099
Come on.

01:06:28.897 --> 01:06:30.073
Shh.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:32.553
What is that?

01:06:33.206 --> 01:06:34.729
I don't know.

01:06:37.863 --> 01:06:39.473
Put her over here.

01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:06.631
I don't know how to be.
I embarrass them.

01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:13.681
And whose perspective
is that, yours?

01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:16.293
Observe your life from
a new perspective.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.251
And whose perspective
is that, yours?

01:07:18.338 --> 01:07:21.428
I don't know how to be.
I embarrass them.

01:07:21.515 --> 01:07:23.300
I embarrass them.

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:26.042
OK, I am not gonna
marry that prick.

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:27.826
Turn it off!

01:07:35.486 --> 01:07:38.097
They're not treating us.

01:07:38.184 --> 01:07:39.751
They've been observing us.

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:44.495
Measuring every single thing
about who we are.

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:47.976
But why?

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.587
I mean, what's all this for?

01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:51.415
-Yu!

01:07:51.502 --> 01:07:52.720
Yu!

01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:55.723
We need to find
a way out of here.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.160
OK.

01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:36.112
This way!

01:08:39.027 --> 01:08:41.639
That lying piece of shit.

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:43.814
Uma! We've gotta go!

01:08:47.384 --> 01:08:49.255
We gotta go now!

01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:51.823
Get them! Get them!
- Uma, now!

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:58.220
Uma, now!

01:08:58.308 --> 01:09:01.528
-Uma!

01:09:05.532 --> 01:09:06.707
Hey!

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:08.144
No!

01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:09.667
Stop!

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.635
Open up, you punks!

01:09:23.246 --> 01:09:24.812
Open the door!

01:09:25.725 --> 01:09:27.685
Break it down!

01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:43.787
Help us.

01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:47.357
Help us!

01:09:47.444 --> 01:09:49.576
Please, help us.
Our friend needs help!

01:09:49.662 --> 01:09:51.099
Girls, get the staff.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.666
Looks like three little
rich girls

01:09:52.752 --> 01:09:53.928
just wandered
into our pool.

01:09:54.015 --> 01:09:55.800
No!

01:09:55.887 --> 01:09:57.236
Who are you?

01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:02.154
We're your substitutes.

01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:06.985
What?

01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:09.683
You don't understand

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:12.338
how hard we've worked
to get here.

01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:15.123
While you...

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.603
eat cake

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:18.257
and pick flowers,

01:10:18.344 --> 01:10:20.520
we work.

01:10:20.607 --> 01:10:23.349
We've practiced
until we fainted.

01:10:24.698 --> 01:10:27.223
We've endured
dozens of surgeries.

01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:30.138
All...

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.879
to be like you.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.970
To be better than you.

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:52.248
You...

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.989
you think you're
gonna replace me?

01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:57.078
You bet I will, darlin'.

01:10:57.165 --> 01:11:00.212
You don't understand
where we come from,

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:02.214
what we've done to get here.

01:11:03.433 --> 01:11:05.609
For every single one of us,

01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:08.089
this is our only chance
at a decent life.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.964
We were born out of your wars.

01:11:13.051 --> 01:11:15.140
We've had to grovel for food.

01:11:16.837 --> 01:11:20.537
You should at least enjoy
the life you've already had.

01:11:23.235 --> 01:11:25.281
-Yu.
-Yu.

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:27.239
Yu, no. Yu!

01:11:27.326 --> 01:11:29.502
Yu! Yu!

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:35.378
Yu. Yu. Yu.

01:11:35.465 --> 01:11:37.771
No, no, no, no, no. No!

01:11:53.047 --> 01:11:56.268
Well, you got what you wanted.

01:11:56.355 --> 01:11:59.706
So I guess one of you is
gonna replace me, aren't you?

01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:01.229
Are you listening to me?

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.666
Are you here?

01:12:02.753 --> 01:12:04.494
Did they give you
hair like mine?

01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:05.843
Eyes like mine?

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:07.888
My mouth?

01:12:07.975 --> 01:12:09.455
My skin?

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:11.196
The scar on my leg?

01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:21.380
Well, there's one thing
they haven't given you.

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:29.649
This is my father.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.697
Well, take a good look at him,

01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:35.568
'cause he's dead.

01:12:35.655 --> 01:12:38.354
And the man who's paying
for you is to blame.

01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:44.664
You wanna be me?

01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:47.188
You have to carry that
around with you.

01:12:48.538 --> 01:12:49.843
Always.

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:58.939
Do you believe
you're the only one

01:12:59.026 --> 01:13:00.463
with a story like that?

01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:05.816
You know,
we have families, too.

01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:08.340
Uma, run!
Go, just go!

01:13:08.427 --> 01:13:11.212
-Hey!
-Get them!

01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:12.692
Stop!

01:13:12.779 --> 01:13:13.867
Get 'em!

01:13:13.954 --> 01:13:15.173
Get them!

01:13:18.742 --> 01:13:21.005
Open the door!
Open it!

01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:23.007
Break it down!

01:13:40.894 --> 01:13:42.896
-OK.
-OK.

01:13:51.688 --> 01:13:53.037
Come on.

01:13:57.345 --> 01:13:58.912
What is this?

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.052
It's OK.

01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:54.228
Keep going.

01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:13.247
Chloe?

01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:15.423
Uma!

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.991
-Chloe!

01:15:18.078 --> 01:15:19.906
-Chloe, where are you?
- Uma!

01:16:27.495 --> 01:16:29.672
Uma!

01:16:32.196 --> 01:16:33.719
Uma!

01:17:07.448 --> 01:17:09.842
Uma!

01:17:09.929 --> 01:17:11.191
Chloe?

01:17:14.281 --> 01:17:15.456
Chloe.

01:17:31.603 --> 01:17:32.909
Uma.

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:45.138
What are you?

01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:48.881
I'm just like you.

01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:51.928

I can't exactly
stop now, can I?

01:18:49.115 --> 01:18:51.422
Who'd want me then?

01:18:51.944 --> 01:18:53.163
Who'd...

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:55.252
want...

01:18:55.339 --> 01:18:56.557
me then?

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:14.532
Leave her alone!

01:19:15.402 --> 01:19:17.230
I said leave her alone.

01:19:25.325 --> 01:19:26.718
Isn't this cute?

01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:28.720
A family reunion!

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:33.290
That's my substitute,
you idiot.

01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:35.771
I'm the one you want.

01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:40.732
No, I'm the one you want.

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:43.343
Don't listen,
she's lying to you!

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:45.911
- That's my substitute.
- I'm the one
you're looking for.

01:19:45.998 --> 01:19:48.305
How can you not recognize me?
Don't listen to her.

01:19:48.392 --> 01:19:49.741
-It's me.
-Liar!

01:19:49.828 --> 01:19:51.612
-Liar!
-I'm the one you want!

01:19:51.699 --> 01:19:53.397
Enough!

01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:56.313
Now,

01:19:57.531 --> 01:20:00.317
which one are you?

01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:03.102
I am me.

01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:47.598
We're still missing
one substitute.

01:21:47.685 --> 01:21:48.904
Keep searching.

01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:50.775
Copy.

01:22:23.764 --> 01:22:24.852
Uma.

01:22:27.507 --> 01:22:28.682
Uma.

01:22:35.428 --> 01:22:37.256
She lied to me.

01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:41.260
She told me that you chose him.

01:22:41.347 --> 01:22:44.263
She told me that you
chose Son over me.

01:22:46.613 --> 01:22:48.702
How much did she pay you?

01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:53.142
I won't take it.

01:23:04.892 --> 01:23:07.286
All clear over there, partner?

01:23:13.292 --> 01:23:14.467
Partner?

01:23:21.909 --> 01:23:23.346
Yes, sir.

01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:25.739
All clear.

01:24:03.864 --> 01:24:04.996
Here.

01:24:06.432 --> 01:24:08.217
This belongs to you.

01:24:14.092 --> 01:24:15.746
Thank you.

01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:23.406
What are you gonna do now?

01:24:26.278 --> 01:24:28.628
There's nothing left
where I came from.

01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:32.154
Your parents?

01:24:34.895 --> 01:24:37.811
I tried to take care of
my two little brothers,

01:24:37.898 --> 01:24:40.466
but sixteen hours a day
working in a factory,

01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:42.903
it wasn't enough.

01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:45.515
This man came
to our town and...

01:24:45.602 --> 01:24:47.082
offered me this job.

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.694
If you can call it a job.

01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:53.523
He promised me my brothers
would never go hungry again.

01:24:59.006 --> 01:25:02.358
I had to become somebody else
so I could survive.

01:25:04.447 --> 01:25:06.797
I had to become you.

01:25:12.846 --> 01:25:14.196
I'm sorry.

01:25:31.082 --> 01:25:32.562
What's your name?

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.479
Anna.

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:40.744
It's nice to meet you, Anna.

01:25:46.489 --> 01:25:48.491
Sing it again, sweetheart!

01:25:50.623 --> 01:25:52.364
What a stunning bride.

01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:54.627
And what a stupendous wedding.

01:25:57.761 --> 01:26:00.198
Your daughter is the epitome
of Upper perfection.

01:26:00.285 --> 01:26:02.069
She's earned the life
ahead of her.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.071
You must be so very proud.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:05.595
Indeed.

01:26:05.682 --> 01:26:07.640
And here she is.

01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:10.165
He was heartbroken
when you were the only one
who went missing

01:26:10.252 --> 01:26:12.036
after that disaster.

01:26:12.123 --> 01:26:14.647
Only a man in love
can suffer like that.

01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:16.649
You should feel fortunate.

01:26:16.736 --> 01:26:18.042
I do.

01:26:18.129 --> 01:26:19.957
Very much so.

01:26:20.044 --> 01:26:21.611
I just... can't imagine

01:26:21.698 --> 01:26:23.569
how difficult it must
have been for him.

01:26:23.656 --> 01:26:25.745
I mean, he's invested
so much in me.

01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:30.968
Smile, kid.

01:26:31.055 --> 01:26:33.927
You're giving it all
back to him now.

01:26:38.236 --> 01:26:41.370
Mr. Hingston is
expecting you upstairs.

01:26:41.457 --> 01:26:44.895
A husband shouldn't be
kept waiting any longer.

01:26:44.982 --> 01:26:48.594
That place works miracles.

01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:51.684
You could be
so difficult before.

01:26:51.771 --> 01:26:53.164
But now...

01:26:55.297 --> 01:26:58.082
it's as if that girl
never existed.

01:27:28.982 --> 01:27:30.984
Please, don't worry.

01:27:31.071 --> 01:27:32.334
I'll go.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.097
Uma!

01:28:40.184 --> 01:28:41.359
Uma!

01:28:41.446 --> 01:28:44.667
Oh, baby, what happened?
