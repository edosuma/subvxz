01:45.683 --> 01:46.718
Truth is hard.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.471
But Hostility stays outside. Who would like to start?

01:50.560 --> 01:53.314
Well, you’re the one with all the answers, Doc, why don’t you tell us?

01:53.457 --> 01:56.011
- Hostility stays outside, Dan.
- Things have just gotten out of hand,

01:56.118 --> 01:57.886
- so, we thought we could use some…
- No, you thought.

01:57.967 --> 02:01.838
- … objectivity.
- Define “gotten out of hand”. Nathan?

02:02.147 --> 02:02.939
Pass.

02:05.924 --> 02:09.984
We reached the breaking point two weeks ago when my son…

02:10.082 --> 02:13.061
- You hear that? “My son”.
- Deb is speaking now, Dan.

02:13.134 --> 02:18.494
When our son collapsed on the basketball court after taking drugs to boost his performance.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.112
The kid made a mistake, he knows that.

02:20.174 --> 02:23.911
His father has been bullying him about the sport since he was old enough to hold a ball.

02:24.423 --> 02:25.492
Is that true, Nathan?

02:25.560 --> 02:29.660
His mother is so quick to put the blame on me, but up until recently, job always came first.

02:29.729 --> 02:32.374
Yes, but I changed my behavior Dan, you haven’t.

02:32.656 --> 02:36.178
You cant seem to loose this unhealthy obsession you have with basketball,

02:36.235 --> 02:38.810
- and how Nathan plays it.
- She blames me for her shortcomings as a mother.

02:38.869 --> 02:41.734
Okay, I think we got some things out in the open.

02:42.752 --> 02:46.290
Nathan, do you think that basketball is part of your families problem?

02:47.284 --> 02:49.414
- Part of.
- But you still like playing?

02:49.895 --> 02:50.899
I don’t know anymore.

02:52.595 --> 02:54.031
Great, nice break through Nate.

02:54.811 --> 02:55.599
Thanks, Doc.

02:57.550 --> 02:59.797
- Dan.
- Hustle up! No way this is helping.

03:02.972 --> 03:07.252
You’re right, Dan, we don’t need a shrink to identify this families problem, you just made it obvious.

03:07.339 --> 03:08.692
I’m not his only parent, Deb.

03:09.316 --> 03:13.012
- Hey why don’t you ride with your old man, Nathan.
- Stop it, Dan. Come on Nathan, lets go.

03:13.115 --> 03:15.741
Let the kid make up his own mind. What do you say, son?

03:18.335 --> 03:19.172
Nate?

03:21.845 --> 03:22.691
Nathan!

03:24.745 --> 03:27.835
Here we go. This is the writer I was talking about.

03:28.852 --> 03:30.437
Somerset Maugham?

03:30.887 --> 03:32.213
Well its, “Maugham”

03:32.835 --> 03:35.229
- Human Bondage.
- Bondage!

03:36.698 --> 03:37.962
Yeah, its not like that.

03:39.474 --> 03:42.561
So, you’re good. Are we done here?

03:43.764 --> 03:48.447
Well, I just thought that this was a better opportunity for us to spend some time,

03:48.617 --> 03:49.626
you know, hang out with each other.

03:49.724 --> 03:55.274
And it is, but can we maybe do it someplace that smells a little less funky?

03:55.878 --> 03:59.042
Haha, it’s the smell of old books.

03:59.236 --> 04:02.928
Like I said! Come on, its my turn. Please?

04:06.194 --> 04:07.448
Just keep it legal.

04:26.260 --> 04:30.586
Wait, you sure your parents wont come home?

04:31.677 --> 04:32.347
They could.

04:33.551 --> 04:35.778
But, this isn’t their Jacuzzi.

04:38.461 --> 04:40.883
Brooke… whose house is this?

04:41.810 --> 04:42.623
I don’t know!

04:43.584 --> 04:44.498
Does it matter?

05:04.774 --> 05:05.591
Here you go.

05:07.538 --> 05:09.801
Wow, for the diet special that looks pretty damn tasty.

05:11.091 --> 05:13.195
Oh! Sorry.

05:17.825 --> 05:19.958
Things have worked out pretty well, huh?

05:20.926 --> 05:23.005
Karen’s café gets to stay open,

05:23.604 --> 05:25.775
and I get to see a little more of my sister-in-law.

05:26.937 --> 05:28.151
So, how are you doing with things?

05:29.744 --> 05:34.566
Uh, we had our first counseling session yesterday.

05:34.648 --> 05:38.853
Dan and counseling. It’s kind of like Hannibal Lector at a salad bar.

05:41.234 --> 05:43.706
Well, if you think it would help, I’d be happy to talk to Nathan.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.262
I think he’d like that.

05:51.102 --> 05:54.893
I know you like my women, Keith, but come on! Deb’s still my wife.

05:55.057 --> 05:56.640
Won’t be for long if you keep this up.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.610
I’m taking Nathan to dinner tonight.

06:06.142 --> 06:07.162
Do you have a problem with that?

06:07.468 --> 06:10.693
- Yeah. He needs a break from you.
- You can't stop me from seeing my own son.

06:10.760 --> 06:15.450
Oh, actually I can. By telling you nicely, or calling a lawyer. Your choice.

06:17.872 --> 06:19.331
Tell him I’ll pick him up at 7.

06:24.436 --> 06:27.109
Tell Nathan to come see me. I’ll do what I can.

06:39.961 --> 06:40.662
Peyton?

06:52.000 --> 06:52.889
Peyton!

07:06.226 --> 07:08.759
- Where’s Peyton?
- Dressing for school is my guess.

07:09.164 --> 07:09.984
Who are you?

07:11.197 --> 07:15.421
I’m the guy who’s about to take that rake from you and beat your scrawny ass.

07:17.463 --> 07:18.924
I’m her dad. Who are you?

07:19.016 --> 07:21.816
Oh. Sorry.

07:23.470 --> 07:25.559
The front door was open and I thought…

07:27.162 --> 07:27.903
I’m Lucas.

07:28.395 --> 07:29.220
Larry Sawyer.

07:29.675 --> 07:30.792
Hey dad, do you know where my…

07:32.384 --> 07:33.331
What are you doing here?

07:33.531 --> 07:35.911
Oh he’s trying to rake me to death.

07:36.366 --> 07:36.992
What?!

07:38.942 --> 07:40.939
I thought you were…

07:42.777 --> 07:43.499
nothing crucial.

07:45.205 --> 07:46.238
I’m gonna go put this back.

07:51.108 --> 07:53.002
- So, who’s the guy?
- What guy?

07:53.177 --> 07:54.568
The one that’s got you smiling.

07:55.148 --> 07:56.442
That’d be my dad.

07:56.734 --> 07:59.525
Oh, I’d be smiling too but for entirely different reasons.

08:00.150 --> 08:03.580
Dude, that’s my dad! Don’t go all horndog on me. There’s a line!

08:04.281 --> 08:08.752
Speaking of which, I really don’t wanna cross any so tell me if this is totally inappropriate to ask.

08:08.910 --> 08:10.180
When has that every stopped you?

08:10.524 --> 08:12.551
I need to connect more with Lucas.

08:12.633 --> 08:14.046
I thought you guys were already doing that.

08:14.603 --> 08:18.756
I mean, the making out thing is great and all but it only goes so far.

08:19.447 --> 08:20.641
Can you help a girl out?

08:22.617 --> 08:24.490
Yeah. You know what?

08:28.534 --> 08:29.487
Give him this.

08:30.741 --> 08:31.499
Travis.

08:31.658 --> 08:37.563
Yeah, Tell him that tracks 8 and 11 make you think of him.

08:37.832 --> 08:41.110
Great. Wait, make me think of him or make you think of him?

08:41.304 --> 08:42.246
Just friends.

08:42.554 --> 08:45.632
I know, sorry. You’re a goddess.

08:51.176 --> 08:52.519
Did you finish ‘The Little Prince’?

08:53.194 --> 08:56.429
No, I just rented the movie. This book is stupid.

08:57.361 --> 09:00.259
Nathan, you’re not going to pass French if you keep renting movies.

09:00.316 --> 09:02.615
Well, its not like I have a lot of time to just sit around and read.

09:04.483 --> 09:07.202
So, are you ever going to tell me how it went?

09:10.499 --> 09:13.607
The therapist asked me if I really want to play basketball or not.

09:13.914 --> 09:14.984
Wow, what did you say?

09:15.891 --> 09:17.206
I didn’t know what to say.

09:18.322 --> 09:19.885
Nobody’s ever asked me that question.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.369
Wow, that’s really big.

09:21.445 --> 09:23.735
This last couple of weeks without it,

09:25.010 --> 09:29.276
I mean if I didn’t play I might actually have a life.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.216
- What would you do?
- I don’t know.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.339
At least I’d have some time to figure it out though.

09:35.747 --> 09:39.617
Besides, I’m sure we could find a lot better things to do with our time, right?

09:39.750 --> 09:40.487
You think?

09:44.044 --> 09:45.649
I think you’re really brave.

09:46.196 --> 09:47.973
To consider rebuilding who you are.

09:49.780 --> 09:50.885
I don’t know if I could do that.

09:51.705 --> 09:52.207
You could.

09:58.003 --> 09:59.969
- Well, I gotta go.
- Oh yeah.

10:02.607 --> 10:05.698
Hey, um, practice starts back up again today, right?

10:07.071 --> 10:10.921
Yeah, I’m just not sure if I do.

10:13.837 --> 10:14.639
I’ll see ya.

10:26.849 --> 10:30.142
All work and no Brooke make Luke a boring boy.

10:30.761 --> 10:32.435
- Hey.
- I got you something.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.072
But I don’t have anything for you.

10:35.462 --> 10:36.598
And yet you do.

10:38.574 --> 10:42.394
A couple of songs on there that made me think of you. Of course most things do.

10:42.690 --> 10:43.734
I didn’t know you were into Travis.

10:43.808 --> 10:46.361
Are you kidding, I love Travis. He’s the best.

10:47.018 --> 10:48.010
Who?

10:48.298 --> 10:51.759
Travis guy. Are we not in the same conversation?

10:53.785 --> 10:56.439
Check out tracks 8 and 13. You’ll love them.

10:58.111 --> 10:58.983
Bye.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.363
Thought you might want that back.

11:09.265 --> 11:10.171
I already have it.

11:10.990 --> 11:11.763
So do I.

11:14.618 --> 11:17.528
Tracks 8 and 11? Totally you.

11:18.357 --> 11:21.578
So what are you doing? Some sort of serrano thing for Brooke?

11:22.521 --> 11:24.682
- Why would I do that?
- Well, I asked you first

11:25.669 --> 11:30.938
Look, don’t underestimate Brooke. She’s full of surprises. Its just part of her charm.

11:32.616 --> 11:34.548
She told me to listen to track 13.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.147
There are only 12 songs.

11:38.648 --> 11:39.724
Honest mistake.

11:41.008 --> 11:42.918
Yeah, I guess.

11:44.496 --> 11:51.244
Anyway, sorry about this morning with your dad. I had no idea he was there.

11:51.817 --> 11:53.271
It’s cause he usually isn’t.

11:54.341 --> 11:55.786
I thought you were happy with your setup.

11:57.870 --> 11:59.067
That’s what I tell him.

11:59.620 --> 12:03.998
I make up stuff in the emails I send him about how happy I am being on my own,

12:04.162 --> 12:07.399
and how responsible I’m being even when I’m not.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.849
He loves his job, you know?

12:11.192 --> 12:16.122
And after my mom died, it’s just not fair to ask him to give that up.

12:18.468 --> 12:20.019
But I miss him when he’s away.

12:24.125 --> 12:24.944
You tell him that?

12:26.285 --> 12:30.786
He worries. It’s just better not to.

12:34.586 --> 12:37.909
So listen, I don’t have a lot of quiet time these days.

12:39.004 --> 12:40.729
You mind if I just sit and read while you draw?

12:41.591 --> 12:43.438
As long as you don’t act out the parts.

12:45.383 --> 12:46.310
Alright.

13:13.462 --> 13:14.966
My mom said you wanted to see me.

13:16.386 --> 13:17.010
Yeah.

13:20.046 --> 13:21.356
Hand me that ratchet, would you?

13:27.838 --> 13:28.901
So how are you holding up?

13:28.968 --> 13:30.479
Why? Are you going to report it back to my mom?

13:32.808 --> 13:34.100
It’s not like that, Nate.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.479
Look, I know you and I haven’t talked very much.

13:37.801 --> 13:43.248
And I’m sorry about that. But that’s just fall out from your dad and me.

13:44.476 --> 13:48.220
I know you’re going through some tough times so, if you need anything...

13:51.129 --> 13:53.115
Well, let me ask you something.

13:54.577 --> 13:56.120
You played basketball in high school, right?

13:56.556 --> 13:58.481
- Only for a little while.
- You didn’t enjoy it?

13:59.091 --> 14:03.580
What are you kidding me? I loved it! But there was no pressure then.

14:04.318 --> 14:06.708
And then I didn’t love it so much anymore.

14:07.169 --> 14:11.474
Your dad came up and just made everything a competition.

14:12.909 --> 14:14.229
So then you just walked away?

14:14.747 --> 14:16.406
Only looked back at the cheerleaders.

14:18.536 --> 14:21.777
It’s just a game, Nate. Not a life.

14:24.547 --> 14:28.843
Hey spirit girl. That cheerleading thing always throws me off.

14:29.197 --> 14:29.892
What?

14:30.116 --> 14:32.774
Just the more I get to know you the harder it is to wrap my head around it.

14:33.307 --> 14:37.390
My mom used to cheer and Brooke and I have been cheering together forever so it’s just kind of our thing.

14:37.497 --> 14:38.683
- Oh cool.
- What’s up?

14:39.491 --> 14:45.482
So, um, I need some advice. About Nathan. I don’t know if its crossing a line.

14:45.908 --> 14:47.484
Okay, funny wasn’t what I was going for but..

14:47.710 --> 14:50.219
I was the queen of boyfriend-dysfunction and now I guess

14:50.280 --> 14:53.987
I’m everybody’s go-to on relationship advice its just kind of bizarre, right?

14:54.064 --> 14:55.615
If it’s too weird then…

14:55.697 --> 14:59.205
No it’s cool. What’s going on?

14:59.466 --> 15:03.613
Well, um, Nathan’s talking about quitting the team.

15:03.711 --> 15:06.356
And I just, I don’t know what to say.

15:06.444 --> 15:10.453
Yeah, look I could never find the words to get through that big wall that he puts up

15:10.530 --> 15:12.819
so I really can’t help you out much.

15:13.857 --> 15:16.429
But you’re so much better with him than I ever was.

15:17.304 --> 15:19.439
He’s lucky to have you.

15:19.976 --> 15:20.544
Thanks.

15:21.861 --> 15:23.412
I don’t want to keep you from your practice.

15:23.601 --> 15:24.974
Hmm. Go Ravens.

15:26.137 --> 15:30.232
Hey, um, I didn’t mean anything, about your mom.

15:32.034 --> 15:32.757
It’s cool.

15:33.498 --> 15:34.148
Okay.

15:38.265 --> 15:40.063
You could have told me Travis was a group.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.003
It’s not like it’s some big secret.

15:42.802 --> 15:46.596
Lucas gave me the weirdest look when I said that. I felt so stupid.

15:46.658 --> 15:49.856
You’re not stupid. You guys just don’t like the same things.

15:49.924 --> 15:55.172
See, that’s the problem. He brings up art and books and I’ve got nothing.

16:00.407 --> 16:01.654
- Hey you.
- Hey you.

16:02.315 --> 16:02.991
And you.

16:05.186 --> 16:06.784
Welcome back, gentlemen.

16:07.143 --> 16:10.972
Lets see how soft you all got after that little hiatus.

16:11.868 --> 16:15.027
Suicides. Now.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.490
Better be a basketball in that thing, Jagielski.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.117
Come on, Coach. It’s either this or I miss practice.

16:23.701 --> 16:28.720
Alright, we'll find her a spot with a good view so that she can watch her daddy throw up.

16:29.548 --> 16:30.848
I’ll take her, Jake.

16:30.956 --> 16:31.673
Yeah?

16:37.884 --> 16:38.595
Thanks, Peyton.

16:38.882 --> 16:39.541
Glad to.

16:40.592 --> 16:41.790
Alright, gather around.

16:45.348 --> 16:46.178
Where’s Nathan?

16:47.366 --> 16:50.167
Tim, you’re his girlfriend, where is he?

16:50.254 --> 16:52.480
I don’t know, coach. He was at school today.

16:53.863 --> 16:54.610
Alright.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.569
I’ve got some offensive sets worked out here.

16:59.255 --> 17:00.868
Line up at the low stacks.

17:11.202 --> 17:12.593
So I had an idea.

17:13.580 --> 17:14.364
Okay.

17:15.361 --> 17:17.676
Remember when I read that Steinberg book?

17:18.079 --> 17:18.791
Steinbeck.

17:18.925 --> 17:22.436
Yeah, that guy. And then you did something that I wanted.

17:22.565 --> 17:25.500
Oh yeah, yeah. Getting drunk, tattooed and grounded?

17:25.571 --> 17:26.595
But in a fun way.

17:27.707 --> 17:29.166
I’m thinking we should try that again.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.342
Okay, you might want to run that by Keith first.

17:31.466 --> 17:37.101
Not exactly that, I just, I want to know everything about you.

17:38.182 --> 17:42.720
And I want you to know… almost everything about me.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.381
- What’s going on, Brooke?
- Nothing.

17:46.062 --> 17:49.421
I just... I want to know you better, Luke.

17:50.357 --> 17:54.582
So how about, the next time you do something you love, you bring me along,

17:55.063 --> 17:56.189
and then we trade.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.164
Are you busy after practice tomorrow?

17:59.405 --> 18:00.075
Yeah,

18:02.467 --> 18:03.685
I have a date with you.

18:12.006 --> 18:14.657
Half with olives. We aim to please.

18:14.733 --> 18:17.295
Well, you hit the bulls eye Tara.

18:20.858 --> 18:23.121
What? You know how I like to kid around.

18:23.305 --> 18:24.811
Yeah, you’re famous for it.

18:26.101 --> 18:28.476
Dad, you really think that’s gonna help what’s going on?

18:28.881 --> 18:33.600
Look, you know I think this counseling crap is ridiculous but I promised your mom I’d try again.

18:34.389 --> 18:35.420
We’ll be okay.

18:35.777 --> 18:36.464
Right.

18:37.175 --> 18:38.543
You just focus on your game.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.980
Whitey kick your ass today?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.343
I didn’t go to practice.

18:49.372 --> 18:50.779
What’s going on with you, Nate?

18:51.205 --> 18:54.496
Nothing, I just need some time. Okay?

18:54.573 --> 18:56.908
No its not okay. It’s career suicide.

18:57.189 --> 18:59.356
- Dad, Keith said…
- Keith said!

19:00.364 --> 19:05.069
You talked to Keith? You take advice from Keith you’ll end up spending the rest of your life

19:05.126 --> 19:07.731
running a second rate auto garage. Is that what you want?

19:10.890 --> 19:11.888
I told you.

19:13.622 --> 19:15.582
I don’t know what I want.

19:35.769 --> 19:36.873
That’s just freaky.

19:36.965 --> 19:39.274
Where do you get off telling Nathan he can quit the team?

19:39.356 --> 19:40.826
I didn’t tell him he could quit.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.768
He wanted to talk, we talked.

19:45.356 --> 19:46.688
Maybe you ought to try it, sometimes.

19:46.750 --> 19:50.195
So you neglect him most of his life, I’m out of the house a week, and there you are?

19:50.278 --> 19:51.757
He surprised me, Dan.

19:53.159 --> 19:54.624
You know, Nathan’s a good kid.

19:54.834 --> 19:57.322
You got him so screwed up he doesn’t know what he wants.

19:57.369 --> 19:59.032
Deb got her hand up your back, Keith?

19:59.422 --> 20:02.177
Deb’s the best thing Nathan’s got going for him right now.

20:02.386 --> 20:05.161
- She’s trying to save him.
- What the hell do you think I’m trying to do?

20:05.980 --> 20:08.591
I’ve been trying to figure that out all these years, Danny.

20:09.529 --> 20:12.125
I don’t mind you playing Daddy to one of my offspring,

20:12.195 --> 20:13.773
but leave the good one alone, would you?

20:20.285 --> 20:22.918
Hey Peyton. Missing these?

20:23.433 --> 20:26.752
Those are the keys to the squads equipment cabinet.

20:26.936 --> 20:30.658
I gave them to Jenny yesterday to play with. She was shaking them like a pom pom.

20:31.303 --> 20:32.456
Maybe she’ll be a cheerleader.

20:32.723 --> 20:34.596
Or President. You gotta think big.

20:34.838 --> 20:37.611
Alright, you never know. Whatever makes her happy.

20:38.620 --> 20:41.125
You know, I think its really amazing how committed to her you are.

20:43.162 --> 20:48.748
Well, its really not that hard. I mean, from the moment I saw her I was totally hooked.

20:49.075 --> 20:54.191
She’s just so cute. And I think about watching her grow up.

20:54.937 --> 20:56.864
I couldn’t imagine not being there.

20:58.421 --> 21:00.468
You know, I bet you’re a really great dad.

21:01.484 --> 21:02.772
I don’t know.

21:03.802 --> 21:05.067
Some days I wonder.

21:13.632 --> 21:14.584
Hey Nathan.

21:15.091 --> 21:15.572
Hey.

21:16.677 --> 21:17.610
Missed you at practice.

21:18.787 --> 21:21.623
Look man, you don’t have to be nice to me cause I’m going out with Haley, okay?

21:21.707 --> 21:25.126
I’m not. Team sucks on a day without you man.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.155
Ask Whitey.

21:27.471 --> 21:28.715
I’m trying to avoid him.

21:30.323 --> 21:33.138
That’s cool. Do what you got to do.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.450
Usually do.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.263
Am I hallucinating? Did I just see you talking to Lucas?

21:38.546 --> 21:40.313
No, he was trying to talk to me.

21:41.245 --> 21:43.247
The whole nice guy thing’s wearing kind of thin.

21:44.496 --> 21:45.724
You want to walk to English?

21:45.914 --> 21:49.549
Actually, I think I’m gonna cut out of here a little bit early. Wanna join me?

21:50.143 --> 21:51.095
Are you serious?

21:51.250 --> 21:53.456
Yeah, why not? You up for it?

21:54.707 --> 21:56.113
I can’t, Nathan.

21:56.651 --> 22:00.532
Alright. Well, look, I gotta get out of here so I’ll catch you later.

22:00.608 --> 22:01.300
Okay.

22:04.541 --> 22:08.232
You know what? Catch me now.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.506
- Oh My God!
- Nice, huh?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.364
So, are we trying to get killed?

22:28.442 --> 22:31.206
I told you, my dad’s in Charlotte, it’s okay.

22:32.178 --> 22:34.523
I’ve never seen you like this.

22:36.542 --> 22:37.611
Now you have.

22:44.705 --> 22:46.509
- Let’s go inside.
- Okay.

22:49.256 --> 22:52.833
- Okay, 1...3...5...
- Okay.

22:53.084 --> 22:54.698
- Got it?
- Yeah I’m good.

22:57.272 --> 22:59.315
Oh, stop moving the pier.

23:04.876 --> 23:06.000
Nice knowing you.

23:07.712 --> 23:10.902
You’ve got Mason Bowl next week and this is how you’re training?

23:10.973 --> 23:13.144
- Can we do this later?
- There may not be a later for you.

23:13.334 --> 23:15.372
- Oh, oh Mr. Scott...
- Was I talking to you?

23:15.434 --> 23:17.036
Get in the car. I’m driving you both home.

23:18.997 --> 23:22.002
You’re mother’s going to love this. You getting drunk on her watch…

23:33.246 --> 23:37.633
There’s some kind of interesting news that I need to talk to you about.

23:39.806 --> 23:41.376
Why does interesting scare me?

23:41.449 --> 23:46.481
No, no. Listen, the company’s been hired to do some flood control.

23:46.850 --> 23:48.074
They want me to supervise.

23:48.996 --> 23:50.270
How long is it going to be this time?

23:50.375 --> 23:55.026
Well, seeing that it is in New Zealand, um, 3 maybe 4 months.

23:58.774 --> 24:00.244
So, what’s the upside?

24:02.471 --> 24:05.532
It’s a lot of money, sweetie. Way more than I make now.

24:06.736 --> 24:11.288
We could be good to go for a while. Maybe even afford that art school you talk about.

24:12.009 --> 24:13.427
Is this something that you want?

24:14.370 --> 24:16.368
I only want to do this if it’s right for us.

24:20.841 --> 24:21.984
You should do it, dad.

24:31.425 --> 24:32.510
What happened to you?

24:32.899 --> 24:34.230
Nice to see you too.

24:35.644 --> 24:36.928
Yeah, I missed you in sixth period.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.878
Yeah, I kind of skipped.

24:42.103 --> 24:44.429
You can get your jaw off the floor now.

24:44.639 --> 24:45.946
He’s got you skipping school?

24:46.023 --> 24:48.008
Lucas, talk to me when you get your tattoo removed.

24:49.891 --> 24:51.055
Alright.

24:55.996 --> 24:56.942
Lucas!

24:57.548 --> 24:58.213
What are you doing?

24:58.362 --> 24:59.488
I’m taking care of my little girl.

24:59.565 --> 25:02.688
You are such a trouble maker. Daddy stop it, come on. Don’t. Stop.

25:03.631 --> 25:05.504
Hey, sit down, Rake Boy.

25:05.646 --> 25:08.858
Hey. I’m never gonna live that one down.

25:09.334 --> 25:10.393
Probably not.

25:11.187 --> 25:13.266
It’s okay, he can be way worse.

25:14.588 --> 25:15.454
What have you got there?

25:17.152 --> 25:21.090
- You’re reading Faulkner in school now?
- No, I just love his stuff.

25:54.724 --> 25:57.923
So what did you do last night? I saw you with Peyton.

25:58.359 --> 25:59.414
What are you talking about?

25:59.854 --> 26:01.328
You two just looked pretty friendly.

26:01.615 --> 26:03.862
Well, that’s because we’re friends.

26:03.950 --> 26:04.845
And what are we?

26:05.060 --> 26:07.534
Well, I thought that we were dating.

26:08.548 --> 26:10.530
Well, it looked more like you were dating Peyton.

26:11.621 --> 26:12.746
How messed up is that?

26:13.709 --> 26:14.481
Brooke!

26:16.688 --> 26:17.498
What was that about?

26:17.656 --> 26:20.266
She's mad. She saw us together last night.

26:20.743 --> 26:24.849
I’ll talk to her. Explain to her how bored out of my skull I was

26:24.911 --> 26:27.211
listening to you and my dad talk about dead writers all night.

26:29.367 --> 26:33.155
You okay? You just seemed kind of weird when your dad called me over.

26:33.913 --> 26:37.307
He had just told me about this horrid job he’s taken in New Zealand,

26:37.369 --> 26:39.319
so he’s gonna be gone for like ever now.

26:39.453 --> 26:40.845
Well, did you tell him not to?

26:41.065 --> 26:42.044
It’s important to him.

26:42.151 --> 26:43.627
Yeah but he doesn’t know it’s important to you.

26:43.907 --> 26:47.783
You’ve got to stop pretending everything’s okay… he might surprise you.

26:59.709 --> 27:02.287
Oh hey. I almost gave up on you.

27:03.210 --> 27:05.476
- Lost track, sorry.
- It's okay.

27:06.474 --> 27:07.971
You still hung over?

27:08.057 --> 27:09.779
I’m not as bad as your dad’s pants.

27:11.248 --> 27:12.370
How great was that?

27:12.783 --> 27:13.433
Horrible.

27:15.528 --> 27:17.802
Let’s just tackle some geometry, okay?

27:18.615 --> 27:23.624
Or, Bottle Rocket is playing at this theater downtown. We could take the train.

27:23.699 --> 27:24.550
Are you serious?

27:24.687 --> 27:26.505
I promise I won’t get your drunk, okay?

27:30.705 --> 27:33.064
We are doing equation’s on the train.

27:33.378 --> 27:37.165
Alright, it’s not exactly risky business, but there’s always the ride back.

27:40.294 --> 27:41.319
Is this one mine?

27:41.415 --> 27:46.479
No. I… This girl I know missed a pop quiz in English Lit yesterday.

27:46.575 --> 27:48.298
Haley, you got an F?

27:48.399 --> 27:51.036
Mr. Kelly said I could make it up. It’s no big deal.

27:52.572 --> 27:55.711
It’s shocking, I’m human, I know. Let’s go.

28:05.502 --> 28:09.821
Hey, check this out. New web cam with 2 way voice capability.

28:10.174 --> 28:13.052
Sweet, huh? No more hunt and peck.

28:13.124 --> 28:16.498
That’s great. Daddy, I just…

28:16.687 --> 28:21.899
Hey, and since I missed your last birthday, I got a little surprise for you.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.438
You’ve been yammering about working with oils.

28:28.981 --> 28:32.524
Wow, um, these are way too expensive.

28:32.621 --> 28:34.741
Not anymore, thanks to Global Dredging.

28:35.524 --> 28:38.489
- So, you already took the job?
- Yep, made the call this morning.

28:39.687 --> 28:41.632
Well, congratulations.

28:41.786 --> 28:45.278
Yeah, yeah, well you and I are going to go out and celebrate, what do you say?

28:45.422 --> 28:48.718
- Okay.
- Let me go change. I’ll be quick.

28:54.852 --> 28:59.127
You know, sometimes we hold back to spare each other’s feelings, and our own.

28:59.501 --> 29:01.963
So maybe it’s good that we have a session without Nathan.

29:02.128 --> 29:04.161
Holding back hasn’t been our problem.

29:04.396 --> 29:06.402
- How is he doing?
- He’s out of control.

29:06.497 --> 29:08.922
- He’s skipping school.
- Basketball practice.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.532
Yesterday we caught him drinking.

29:11.161 --> 29:12.810
Sounds like he wants your attention.

29:12.891 --> 29:16.502
He was a good kid before. Worked hard. Kept busy with sports.

29:16.567 --> 29:18.886
He needs to find himself outside of sports.

29:18.959 --> 29:21.098
Right, take away the one sure thing the kids got.

29:22.629 --> 29:24.120
Tell me about basketball, Dan.

29:24.227 --> 29:26.305
Uh, you put a ball through a hoop.

29:27.017 --> 29:30.945
- What do you think Nathan gets out of it?
- He gets structure and discipline.

29:31.466 --> 29:33.566
And he gets to know that he’s the best at something.

29:33.674 --> 29:38.475
And also, you can relive your past and feel good about yourself.

29:38.553 --> 29:40.397
Okay, time out.

29:40.509 --> 29:43.719
Um, lets talk about the two of you for a minute.

29:43.801 --> 29:46.883
I mean outside of Nathan, let’s explore what makes you work as a couple.

29:47.062 --> 29:48.987
I mean, who are Deb and Dan Scott?

29:56.868 --> 30:01.497
Well, you’re late, practice was over about 5 hours ago.

30:03.339 --> 30:04.895
I drove past and saw your car.

30:06.391 --> 30:07.415
Don’t you ever go home?

30:09.893 --> 30:12.443
Sometimes I think this is my home.

30:14.958 --> 30:18.151
Well, is this a hit and run or a sit down?

30:19.406 --> 30:20.552
Sit down I guess.

30:21.854 --> 30:22.483
Good.

30:29.602 --> 30:31.305
I don’t know what I’m going to do, Coach.

30:34.797 --> 30:40.203
Nathan, nobody can make you do anything you don’t really want to.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.032
By nobody you mean my dad.

30:44.070 --> 30:45.545
Let me ask you a question.

30:46.982 --> 30:50.070
- Let’s take your father out of the picture.
- I wish.

30:51.780 --> 30:55.559
Let’s take out all the pushing, the pressure,

30:55.620 --> 30:59.640
the training that you’ve got to do to be as good as you are.

31:00.934 --> 31:03.418
Now ask yourself one simple question.

31:04.867 --> 31:06.915
Do you really love this game?

31:11.569 --> 31:12.460
I do.

31:16.182 --> 31:17.954
I just hate what it’s doing to my life.

31:20.016 --> 31:22.182
Then you may have found your answer.

31:37.621 --> 31:38.715
You wanna know what I think?

31:39.447 --> 31:40.682
I’m sure you’ll tell me.

31:40.861 --> 31:43.221
I think he’s trying to have the best of both worlds.

31:43.356 --> 31:44.374
Who? Lucas?

31:45.403 --> 31:51.904
He uses you for some sort of intellectual slash emotional thing, and me he just uses.

31:51.965 --> 31:53.431
Come on, you know he’s not like that.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.843
He’s a guy, Peyton.

31:55.319 --> 31:57.480
I mean, follow the nature trail and they’re all the same.

31:57.547 --> 32:01.004
Brooke, you could have any guy that you want and now you’ve got Lucas,

32:01.065 --> 32:03.641
okay, so can you please just sit back and enjoy it?

32:03.758 --> 32:07.035
He likes you! I like you, okay?

32:07.328 --> 32:09.892
So trust him, trust me,

32:10.861 --> 32:12.503
maybe try trusting yourself, okay?

32:55.703 --> 32:56.810
Doorbell broken?

32:58.459 --> 32:59.554
She never hears it.

33:00.535 --> 33:01.684
She always has her music on.

33:03.932 --> 33:06.692
I tell myself I’m doing what’s best for my daughter.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.928
That she should have whatever she wants.

33:10.870 --> 33:12.641
What I think she wants is you.

33:15.795 --> 33:17.234
Did you see her comic strip today?

33:19.026 --> 33:20.066
What strip?

33:23.342 --> 33:27.592
It’s supposed to be anonymous. Our secret, okay?

33:31.238 --> 33:32.032
Yeah.

33:40.135 --> 33:41.257
Hey Haley, you got a sec?

33:41.466 --> 33:42.901
Hey, you planning our next road trip?

33:43.351 --> 33:45.030
Actually, I thought we could just talk.

33:45.329 --> 33:47.114
Oh yeah, sure, what’s up?

33:48.369 --> 33:49.680
Well, look.

33:51.207 --> 33:53.464
Haley, I’ve had a lot of fun with you lately.

33:54.236 --> 33:58.706
But, I’m trying to apologize. For dragging you out of class the last couple of days.

33:58.774 --> 34:00.371
Oh Nathan, I had fun.

34:00.508 --> 34:02.254
And you got an F on your exam.

34:04.215 --> 34:08.619
Well, so what? You know, I make my own choices and I choose to be with you.

34:08.706 --> 34:09.621
That’s the thing.

34:10.784 --> 34:14.317
Look, I like to be with you too, but the real Haley,

34:15.362 --> 34:20.087
the one that I got all crushed out on, you know? I don’t want to see you change.

34:20.891 --> 34:21.746
I like you.

34:23.815 --> 34:27.025
And I like the fact that somebody like you sees something in me.

34:28.715 --> 34:30.456
Somebody like me or me?

34:30.987 --> 34:32.411
You already know the answer to that.

34:41.159 --> 34:42.139
You waiting for me?

34:45.001 --> 34:46.937
Actually, I’m just hanging out with your dad.

34:47.101 --> 34:47.916
Oh God, help me.

34:49.553 --> 34:53.931
Listen, you should probably talk to Brooke, she’s convinced she’s not being a good enough girlfriend.

34:56.858 --> 34:59.661
Oops, am I interrupting?

35:00.546 --> 35:01.694
Actually, I was just gonna...

35:03.045 --> 35:04.473
Please tell me that’s laundry.

35:04.616 --> 35:08.712
My ride’s on the way. I’m headed out tonight.

35:09.383 --> 35:11.191
You said you were going to be here till Wednesday.

35:12.114 --> 35:14.913
That was before I turned down the job.

35:15.139 --> 35:15.794
What?

35:16.270 --> 35:18.599
They managed to find me a 3 week gig instead.

35:18.682 --> 35:23.019
Then after that, I’m only taking locals, so we can be a family again.

35:23.792 --> 35:25.353
Daddy, don’t joke with me

35:25.482 --> 35:26.531
It’s no joke, hunny.

35:30.807 --> 35:36.259
Peyton, I love what I do, but not nearly as much as I love you.

35:37.631 --> 35:40.862
You’ve been alone enough, no more.

35:42.633 --> 35:43.714
I love you, Daddy.

35:44.712 --> 35:45.587
You better.

35:47.386 --> 35:49.935
Just promise to keep talking to me, okay?

35:50.032 --> 35:53.242
- I want to know what’s going on inside that pretty head.
- Okay.

35:54.697 --> 35:57.789
- Mr. Sawyer, your ride’s here.
- Oh, I gotta go.

35:57.886 --> 35:58.490
Okay.

35:59.141 --> 36:02.351
Lucas, you keep an eye on this one for me, alright?

36:02.965 --> 36:03.738
I will.

36:07.551 --> 36:09.222
I’ll leave the light on for you.

36:13.708 --> 36:17.655
Oh and by the way, I like your comic strip.

36:31.653 --> 36:32.319
Hey.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.669
Keith said you were at Peyton’s, again.

36:36.675 --> 36:40.987
Actually I was with Peyton’s dad, if that makes any difference.

36:42.770 --> 36:43.511
Whatever.

36:44.924 --> 36:46.024
Luke, can we talk?

36:46.567 --> 36:47.172
Yeah.

36:48.073 --> 36:53.828
Okay, I’m not sure if we have a problem, or if I have a problem.

36:54.110 --> 36:54.975
What’s the problem?

36:55.967 --> 36:58.698
In a nutshell, you’re you and I’m me.

37:00.012 --> 37:04.196
Yeah but if I was you, you’d be dating yourself.

37:05.497 --> 37:11.533
What I mean is, I do what I do, and I like what I like, and that’s just who I am.

37:11.604 --> 37:12.322
I know,

37:13.324 --> 37:15.419
and that’s what I love about you.

37:15.546 --> 37:21.778
Okay, but the music that you listen to and the books that you read, I’m not into any of that stuff.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.161
And I never asked you to be.

37:24.793 --> 37:25.551
Okay?

37:28.003 --> 37:30.349
You know, I kind of enjoy the fact that we’re different.

37:31.737 --> 37:32.422
Okay.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.039
I’m sorry.

37:40.329 --> 37:44.818
It’s just that you’re the first really great guy that I’ve ever dated

37:45.279 --> 37:54.695
and that really scares me because I never gave a rat’s ass before, okay?

37:55.331 --> 37:57.209
But I do now.

37:58.228 --> 38:04.228
That’s good, because I give a rats ass about you too.

38:23.702 --> 38:24.945
You’re mother know you’re here?

38:25.180 --> 38:25.790
Yeah,

38:27.847 --> 38:30.089
she said it was cool as long as we didn’t kill each other.

38:33.332 --> 38:35.799
I’m sorry for all the crap I’ve been pulling lately, dad.

38:37.534 --> 38:38.416
I figured.

38:40.822 --> 38:41.686
Everything okay?

38:42.122 --> 38:42.942
Not so good.

38:43.673 --> 38:45.045
Well, you’ll bounce back.

38:48.373 --> 38:50.098
Dad, how did we get so screwed up?

38:51.108 --> 38:52.305
We’ll get through this, Nate.

38:52.981 --> 38:53.734
How?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.212
Everything’s basketball with us, Dad.

38:59.049 --> 39:02.065
And now you’re yelling at me, and mom...

39:02.597 --> 39:04.092
Mom’s yelling back at you.

39:06.008 --> 39:09.929
I’m starting to wonder, is this all because of me?

39:10.016 --> 39:10.621
Nathan…

39:10.932 --> 39:11.972
I mean, Dad, look...

39:15.409 --> 39:18.423
I know you’re upset with me missing practice and everything,

39:19.143 --> 39:22.530
but I’m just not sure if I’ll ever be the player you were.

39:23.994 --> 39:25.638
I’m starting to think maybe...

39:28.567 --> 39:30.282
maybe you chose the wrong son.

39:30.916 --> 39:37.507
Nathan, you have to know, whatever you do, whatever you decide...

39:38.412 --> 39:40.696
you’re my son, and I am proud of you.

39:46.730 --> 39:48.427
I love you.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.301
Hey.

40:23.180 --> 40:24.202
I was looking for you.

40:27.357 --> 40:31.164
I’m done. Just thought you should be the first to know.

40:31.891 --> 40:32.516
Me?

40:32.849 --> 40:35.399
Yeah, you wanted my world man,

40:37.982 --> 40:38.956
it’s all yours.

41:42.394 --> 41:44.299
“And the little prince said to the man”

41:46.122 --> 41:48.436
“Grownups never understand anything for themselves,

41:49.834 --> 41:54.202
and it is tiresome for children to be always explaining things to them.“
