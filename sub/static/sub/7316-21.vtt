You're supposed
to meet me out front, Captain!

00:13.528 --> 00:16.763
I'm not
your personal wake-up call!

00:18.196 --> 00:19.896
I haven't even had
my morning coffee, kid.

00:19.898 --> 00:21.969
You're testing my patience.

00:27.876 --> 00:29.379
What...?

00:31.747 --> 00:34.285
Landis...!

Congratulations.

Ring-a-ding-ding.
Congratulations for what?

01:41.368 --> 01:43.238
Uh, good morning, Tony.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.701
Did you get a new suit?

01:44.703 --> 01:47.109
I did indeed.
It's a Sy Devore original.

01:47.111 --> 01:48.940
The iconic tailor
to the Rat Pack.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.907
Dino, Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr.,

01:50.909 --> 01:53.379
and now Anthony DiNozzo Jr.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.810
Ooh. Very nice.
Whoa! Watch it.

01:55.812 --> 01:57.372
I don't know
where those paws have been.

01:58.149 --> 01:59.179
Well, it looks
really good.

01:59.181 --> 02:00.884
I know it does.
So...

02:00.886 --> 02:02.521
stop buttering me up.
What are you two hiding?

02:02.546 --> 02:03.423
Okay.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.389
Remember when I went
undercover as a model

02:05.391 --> 02:07.124
and your father brought me
into the black market

02:07.126 --> 02:08.395
art scene?
I remember when you went

02:08.398 --> 02:11.195
undercover as me and failed--

02:11.197 --> 02:13.466
if I remember-- what about it?
Well...

02:13.468 --> 02:15.528
word kind of spread
around the office

02:15.530 --> 02:17.400
that I'm kind of
a natural at it.

02:17.402 --> 02:19.199
At what?

02:19.201 --> 02:21.166
Modeling.

02:21.168 --> 02:23.965
McGee has
been chosen

02:23.967 --> 02:27.068
to be the new face of NCIS.

02:27.070 --> 02:29.603
Isn't that great?

02:40.790 --> 02:43.084
What are you doing?
I'm just seeing if I'm...

02:43.086 --> 02:44.619
maybe I'm still asleep,

02:44.621 --> 02:46.291
and I'm gonna wake up
from this nightmare.

02:46.293 --> 02:48.395
Told you he'd
react this way.

02:48.397 --> 02:50.027
You're the new face of NCI...

02:51.397 --> 02:53.362
You stole my gig.
Tony, that was

02:53.364 --> 02:54.834
years ago.
I can understand

02:54.836 --> 02:56.866
being passed over
for Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

02:56.868 --> 02:59.433
Those... cobalt blue eyes.

02:59.435 --> 03:03.872
But to get passed over
a second time and... for you.

03:03.874 --> 03:06.273
Technically, you can't
really be passed over

03:06.275 --> 03:08.441
if you were never in consideration.
Look, Tony,

03:08.443 --> 03:11.378
the-the agency is just trying
to appeal to a younger,

03:11.380 --> 03:14.442
more technologically savvy pool
of recruits.

03:14.466 --> 03:16.284
I'm savvy as Jack Sparrow, baby.
Tony,

03:16.286 --> 03:17.854
you still have an AOL account,

03:17.856 --> 03:20.792
and you type
with your index fingers.

03:20.794 --> 03:21.864
Cary Grant typed
with his index fingers.

03:21.866 --> 03:23.799
Put it away, DiNozzo.

03:23.801 --> 03:26.231
Got a dead Marine in Lake Ridge.
Let's go.

03:30.273 --> 03:31.975
<i>What do you got, Duck?</i>
<i>Overkill.</i>

03:31.977 --> 03:34.041
A series of stab wounds
that even Jack the Ripper

03:34.043 --> 03:35.544
would find excessive.

03:35.568 --> 03:37.699
What a terrifying character
from history.

03:37.882 --> 03:40.383
Certainly made me not want
to become a lady of the night.

03:40.385 --> 03:41.447
Uh...

03:41.449 --> 03:44.082
enlightening
as always,

03:44.084 --> 03:45.114
Mr. Palmer.

03:45.116 --> 03:47.217
He was put in a stress position.

03:47.219 --> 03:49.016
Therefore, any movement he made

03:49.018 --> 03:52.287
to free his hands or feet
from their bindings

03:52.289 --> 03:55.825
caused that rope to tighten
around his neck.

03:55.827 --> 03:58.857
Our killer had a...
oh, an appetite for pain.

03:58.859 --> 04:00.224
Got a time of death?
Pretty recently.

04:00.226 --> 04:01.927
Rigor hasn't even set in yet.

04:01.929 --> 04:03.663
Around 7:30 a.m.

04:03.665 --> 04:05.767
I'll know more
after the examination.

04:05.769 --> 04:08.031
Mr. Palmer, if you please,
would you help me

04:08.033 --> 04:12.009
get this man upright and we can
free him from his restraints.

04:12.011 --> 04:13.473
What do we know?

04:13.475 --> 04:16.209
Well, victim is Marine
Captain David Landis.

04:16.212 --> 04:18.986
30, single, stationed
at the Marine base in Quantico.

04:18.988 --> 04:21.680
Who called it in?
A Gunnery Sergeant Joseph Wilks.

04:21.683 --> 04:24.057
He unsuccessfully engaged
with the assailant.

04:24.059 --> 04:25.720
EMTs are with him now.

04:25.722 --> 04:26.952
We got a murder weapon?
No. I think there's

04:26.954 --> 04:28.288
a good chance
the killer took it with him,

04:28.290 --> 04:29.992
but I did pull some prints
off the chair

04:29.994 --> 04:31.726
the victim was tied to.
I'll get 'em to Abby.

04:31.728 --> 04:34.187
- Tony, Bishop?
<i>- All right. So what exactly</i>

04:34.189 --> 04:35.854
did you see, Mr. Ashmore?

04:35.856 --> 04:38.125
So, I was walking to my car

04:38.127 --> 04:40.358
when this fella turns
that corner

04:40.360 --> 04:43.000
like a bat out of hell,
plows right into me.

04:43.002 --> 04:45.833
Didn't even check to see if
I was hurt, just kept on going.

04:45.835 --> 04:49.505
Kids today have no respect
for guys our age, am I right?

04:49.507 --> 04:51.905
Wait, how did you
know he was a kid?

04:51.907 --> 04:52.856
Wasn't he wearing a ski mask?

04:52.880 --> 04:55.894
No, but he did have some kind
of knit cap in his hand.

04:56.282 --> 04:57.712
Can you describe him?
Early 20s,

04:57.714 --> 04:59.377
lean, dark hair,

04:59.379 --> 05:02.587
and definitely...

05:03.853 --> 05:05.018
What?

05:05.020 --> 05:06.258
Look,

05:06.260 --> 05:07.954
I don't want to profile
or anything,

05:07.956 --> 05:10.291
but the kid
was definitely Middle Eastern.

05:10.293 --> 05:12.899
And I'm not saying that's
a bad thing, but there it is.

05:12.901 --> 05:14.395
And I hope you catch him soon,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.117
because the kid's clearly
got a screw loose.

05:17.941 --> 05:19.170
How you holding up, Gunny?

05:19.172 --> 05:23.167
I'm fine.
It's just a scratch.

05:23.169 --> 05:25.206
Looks to be a bit
more than that.

05:25.208 --> 05:26.975
I need to be here.

05:26.977 --> 05:30.208
I have to help you find
who did this.

05:30.210 --> 05:32.312
How'd you happen
upon the scene?

05:32.314 --> 05:34.352
Landis and I met up
every morning.

05:34.354 --> 05:37.248
We were training
for the marathon.

05:40.594 --> 05:43.327
You knew the captain well?

05:43.329 --> 05:45.927
We've been friends
for years.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.264
Served two tours
in Afghanistan together.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.095
He's like family.

05:52.097 --> 05:54.232
He mixed up in something?
No.

05:54.234 --> 05:57.868
No, I would've known.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.105
Go to the hospital, Gunny.
Get checked out.

06:02.107 --> 06:03.738
I'll be in touch.

06:03.740 --> 06:06.011
The killer got away
because of me.

06:08.245 --> 06:10.180
I should have stopped him.

06:10.182 --> 06:12.918
We'll find him.

06:16.826 --> 06:19.328
Gibbs. Welcome.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.161
Join me.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.530
Abbs? Everything all right?

06:23.532 --> 06:25.370
Of course.

06:25.372 --> 06:27.106
Here.

06:27.108 --> 06:30.306
This was made especially

06:30.308 --> 06:32.642
for you.

06:32.644 --> 06:34.611
It's tea, Gibbs.

06:34.613 --> 06:37.347
From Ducky's
private reserve.

06:37.349 --> 06:39.114
Nice and calming.

06:39.116 --> 06:42.290
“Calm” being the key word here.

06:43.691 --> 06:45.992
Okay. Fine.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.971
But you're gonna wish
you had in about 30 seconds.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.234
Abbs, what'd you find?

06:50.258 --> 06:52.509
I ran an analysis
on the two fingerprints

06:52.510 --> 06:54.813
that McGee found on the chair
at the crime scene.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.717
One is our victim's,

06:56.719 --> 06:59.421
and the other
one belongs to...

07:01.422 --> 07:02.788
...Qasim Naasir.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.227
21-year-old Afghan native
with ties to the Taliban.

07:06.229 --> 07:09.195
The CIA put him on the
terror watch list in 2011,

07:09.197 --> 07:10.859
but he fell off the grid
soon after that.

07:10.861 --> 07:13.563
How did he get in
the United States undetected?

07:13.565 --> 07:14.930
He's already here, Abbs.

07:14.932 --> 07:17.497
I want to know why.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.482
It's so lifelike.

07:30.484 --> 07:33.114
Yeah? HR's gonna put one

07:33.116 --> 07:36.419
in every single NCIS field
office as a recruitment tool.

07:36.421 --> 07:38.452
Consider my interest piqued.
I mean, the face,

07:38.454 --> 07:40.493
the pose,
the commanding presence.

07:40.495 --> 07:43.563
Yeah. Sign me up.
I agree. And on a side note,

07:43.565 --> 07:45.531
the bad boy look
really works for you.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.068
Yeah. If I may.

07:47.070 --> 07:49.635
From a purely expert
medical standpoint,

07:49.637 --> 07:52.466
you have
perfect human proportions.

07:52.468 --> 07:55.473
Very <i> Vitruvian Man.</i>
It's fair to say,

07:55.475 --> 07:57.240
you are a flawless specimen.

07:58.475 --> 08:00.577
Okay! That's enough.

08:00.579 --> 08:01.673
Something wrong, Tony?
Yeah!

08:01.675 --> 08:02.913
I seem to be the only one acting

08:02.915 --> 08:05.178
like a real NCIS agent
in this room,

08:05.180 --> 08:07.754
and we have work to do,
so let's do it.

08:07.756 --> 08:10.754
You sound like Gibbs.
Next step is a... dated wardrobe

08:10.756 --> 08:12.818
and a symmetrically challenged
haircut.

08:16.122 --> 08:17.687
Which
totally works

08:17.689 --> 08:20.223
for some people.

08:23.897 --> 08:25.096
Give me an update.

08:25.098 --> 08:27.706
Okay. Captain David Landis,

08:27.708 --> 08:29.603
graduate of the Naval Academy,
highly decorated

08:29.605 --> 08:32.044
for his tours in Afghanistan.
His unit returned

08:32.046 --> 08:33.813
from their most
recent deployment,

08:33.815 --> 08:36.116
uh, eight months ago.

08:36.119 --> 08:38.852
Uh, that's when
Landis was assigned

08:38.855 --> 08:43.157
to Quantico as an instructor for
Marine Officer Candidate School.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.621
That's a non-operational post.

08:44.623 --> 08:46.493
He didn't have access
to any classified information

08:46.495 --> 08:48.461
that would threaten
national security.

08:48.463 --> 08:49.893
What do we know
about Qasim Naasir?

08:49.895 --> 08:51.260
He was placed
on a watch list,

08:51.262 --> 08:52.933
after the CIA did an
undercover DNA sweep

08:52.935 --> 08:55.903
on a Taliban gathering
in Kandahar.

08:55.905 --> 08:57.039
Included
in the sweep was

08:57.041 --> 08:59.641
Qasim's older brother,
Rasheed Naasir, 27.

08:59.643 --> 09:02.548
A known enforcer for
the terror group, he's claimed

09:02.550 --> 09:05.046
responsibility for
over 100 deaths in Afghanistan.

09:05.071 --> 09:06.022
Now, baby brother

09:06.022 --> 09:07.220
is in the States.

09:07.222 --> 09:09.020
Looks like they're
branching out.

09:09.022 --> 09:10.355
Bishop,
get the CIA files on these two.

09:10.357 --> 09:12.722
Everything they have.
Find out what they're after.

09:12.724 --> 09:14.490
What's the status report
on Gunnery Sergeant Wilks?

09:14.492 --> 09:15.995
Released from the hospital
an hour ago.

09:15.997 --> 09:18.068
Go talk to him.
See if there's any connection

09:18.070 --> 09:19.564
between Captain Landis,

09:19.566 --> 09:21.133
Qasim, and Rasheed.

09:21.135 --> 09:22.837
Yeah, Duck,
I'm on my way.

09:25.272 --> 09:26.478
Uh, McGee...

09:26.480 --> 09:27.878
Yeah.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.615
Bad boy look works for you.

09:36.322 --> 09:38.056
Captain Landis' examination

09:38.058 --> 09:40.257
has proved quite
informative.

09:40.259 --> 09:43.760
His killer stabbed him
seven times, in the torso,

09:43.762 --> 09:45.663
arms, and legs.

09:45.665 --> 09:48.462
All of these
were chosen deliberately.

09:48.464 --> 09:49.662
None were fatal.

09:49.664 --> 09:51.502
You're dealing with a
professional, Jethro,

09:51.504 --> 09:54.135
someone who knows how to inflict
the most pain

09:54.137 --> 09:56.902
while still
keeping his victim alive.

09:56.904 --> 09:58.639
But he didn't keep him alive.
I suspect because

09:58.641 --> 10:00.374
he was interrupted.

10:00.376 --> 10:03.180
The cause of death was
this single cut

10:03.182 --> 10:05.116
to the neck.
The result of that is

10:05.118 --> 10:07.147
the captain bled out
within seconds.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.219
Based on the
time of death,

10:09.221 --> 10:12.252
this was inflicted
around the same time

10:12.254 --> 10:16.155
of the unexpected arrival
of the gunnery sergeant.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.153
The killer panicked.
Precisely.

10:18.155 --> 10:19.392
Which leads me
to conjecture

10:19.394 --> 10:22.023
that he wasn't finished

10:22.025 --> 10:25.829
with his... torturing
of the captain.

10:27.462 --> 10:28.891
Come on.
There's no answer here.

10:28.893 --> 10:31.329
Let's go check
at the hospital.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.592
Maybe he's stuck in traffic.
I say we wait for him here.

10:33.594 --> 10:34.934
What are you doing?

10:34.935 --> 10:36.553
What do you mean?
What do you mean what do I mean?

10:36.554 --> 10:37.760
I see what you're doing

10:37.761 --> 10:39.223
with the arched back,
dominant leg forward,

10:39.225 --> 10:41.593
hands on hips--
you're posing.

10:41.595 --> 10:43.698
What are you talking about? That's crazy.
Is it crazy?

10:43.700 --> 10:45.569
You're getting sucked
into the lifestyle.

10:45.571 --> 10:47.466
Listen, Tony,

10:47.468 --> 10:50.369
this whole modeling thing,
do I know what I'm doing? No.

10:50.371 --> 10:53.305
But I'm here, and I'm gonna
give it my best shot.

10:53.307 --> 10:55.144
You quoting <i> Zoolander</i> to me?

10:55.146 --> 10:56.439
It's worse than I thought.

10:56.441 --> 10:59.144
Uh, Tony?
No, we are not going

10:59.146 --> 11:00.848
for an orange mocha Frappuchino.

11:00.850 --> 11:02.750
No, Tony, it's Qasim.

11:02.752 --> 11:04.046
Oh.

11:04.048 --> 11:05.246
Don't run... no, no!

11:07.584 --> 11:09.055
NCIS!

11:10.722 --> 11:12.625
Stop!

11:15.798 --> 11:17.036
You get him, McGee?

11:17.038 --> 11:18.634
Should've taken the shortcut.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.633
I'm in the Dumpster!
Up. Turn around.

11:20.635 --> 11:23.002
I'm all right; I'm all right.
Against the fence.

11:23.004 --> 11:26.904
Next time, you take the alley.

11:28.009 --> 11:30.637
McGEE:
Oh, look what I found.

11:30.639 --> 11:32.572
Tactical knife.

11:34.813 --> 11:37.881
Could you please change?
The smell is unbearable.

11:37.883 --> 11:39.744
You're referring
to my suit, huh?

11:39.746 --> 11:41.176
Well...

11:41.178 --> 11:42.544
consider it
a new form of torture.

11:42.546 --> 11:44.215
You're a fan of that.

11:44.217 --> 11:47.317
What are you talking about?
No need to play coy, Qasim.

11:47.319 --> 11:49.820
We found your prints at the crime scene.
And your knife

11:49.822 --> 11:51.485
is being analyzed in our lab.

11:51.487 --> 11:54.126
Only a matter of time
before it comes back as a match

11:54.128 --> 11:56.063
to the one used
to kill Captain Landis.

11:57.601 --> 11:59.062
What?

11:59.064 --> 12:00.494
Did Landis recognize you
from the watch list?

12:00.496 --> 12:01.933
Is that why you killed him?

12:01.935 --> 12:03.367
No, I did not kill anyone.

12:03.369 --> 12:05.504
McGEE:
No? Hmm.

12:05.506 --> 12:08.577
I guess that's right--
that's what terrorists do.

12:08.579 --> 12:10.545
You know, terrorists.

12:10.547 --> 12:12.409
Like your brother Rasheed.

12:12.411 --> 12:14.682
He made quite a
name for himself.

12:14.684 --> 12:17.554
Men, women, children-- he's
an equal opportunity killer.

12:17.556 --> 12:21.290
My brother's crimes are heinous,
but they are his own.

12:21.292 --> 12:22.953
I never had
anything to do with it

12:22.955 --> 12:24.391
and I had
nothing to do with this.

12:24.393 --> 12:25.623
Why don't
you explain it

12:25.625 --> 12:26.894
to us, Qasim?

12:26.896 --> 12:29.261
: Start with how you
got into the country.

12:30.893 --> 12:33.161
I have nothing
more to say.

12:40.738 --> 12:42.737
Gibbs, I need
to talk to you.

12:42.739 --> 12:45.441
I've gone over the
CIA's file on Qasim

12:45.443 --> 12:47.610
and I think they
made a mistake.

12:47.612 --> 12:49.010
I don't believe
he's a terrorist.

12:49.012 --> 12:51.609
His DNA was found
in a Taliban safe house.

12:51.611 --> 12:53.449
Yeah, it's more
complicated than that.

12:53.451 --> 12:56.952
I checked with every agency--
CIA, Homeland Security, FBI.

12:56.954 --> 13:01.084
Not one had a bead on Qasim
or Rasheed prior to 2011,

13:01.086 --> 13:02.883
and I figured out why.

13:02.885 --> 13:04.754
They didn't exist before then.

13:04.756 --> 13:06.219
Their real names are Qasim

13:06.221 --> 13:09.891
and Rasheed Mattar, brothers
who went missing in 2008,

13:09.893 --> 13:11.955
after their parents were
murdered by the Taliban.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.095
So connect the dots, Bishop.
It's a common practice for terror groups

13:15.097 --> 13:17.061
like the Taliban
to take children

13:17.063 --> 13:19.196
they've turned into orphans,
brainwash them,

13:19.198 --> 13:20.763
train them,
and give them new names.

13:20.765 --> 13:22.394
These kids aren't even
given a choice, Gibbs.

13:22.396 --> 13:23.794
It's-It's join or die.
It doesn't

13:23.796 --> 13:26.562
erase their crimes.
Crimes Rasheed committed.

13:26.564 --> 13:29.000
He embraced the cause and
rose through the ranks.

13:29.002 --> 13:30.335
Qasim remained in the shadows.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.872
Abbs. Yeah,
I'll be right down.

13:35.874 --> 13:38.273
Gibbs, I don't think Qasim

13:38.275 --> 13:40.312
is here plotting
for the Taliban.

13:40.314 --> 13:42.281
I think he's
hiding from them.

13:42.283 --> 13:44.513
<i> Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,</i>
<i>Gibbs, Gibbs.</i>

13:44.515 --> 13:47.217
You know I don't like to be
kept waiting when I have news.

13:47.219 --> 13:48.888
Abbs, I was on my way down.
What do you got?

13:48.890 --> 13:50.623
Um, okay,
so I finished analyzing

13:50.625 --> 13:53.421
Qasim's knife-- the blade
pattern is not consistent

13:53.423 --> 13:55.525
with the wounds
on Captain Landis.

13:55.527 --> 13:57.157
It's not the murder weapon?
No. But...

13:57.159 --> 13:58.958
I found prints on the handle

13:58.960 --> 14:00.663
that don't match Qasim's.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.864
Guess who they belong to.
Well, who?

14:02.866 --> 14:04.704
Me.

14:05.369 --> 14:06.903
Well, you kind of

14:06.905 --> 14:10.902
stole my thunder a little,
but yes, Gibbs-- him.

14:10.904 --> 14:12.542
You've got the wrong man
in custody.

14:12.544 --> 14:14.446
Qasim is innocent.
You know Qasim?

14:14.448 --> 14:16.711
Landis and I met him
in Afghanistan.

14:16.713 --> 14:19.064
We're the ones that snuck him
into the country.

14:19.065 --> 14:21.752
You brought a suspected terrorist
onto U.S. soil?

14:21.754 --> 14:23.657
Qasim's not a terrorist,
Agent Gibbs.

14:24.955 --> 14:27.330
He's one of us.

14:38.721 --> 14:41.054
Captain Landis,
what day are we on?

14:41.056 --> 14:45.157
18. Only 160 to go.

14:45.159 --> 14:46.861
How's it feel to be back?

14:46.863 --> 14:49.132
My God.
Like we never left.

14:49.134 --> 14:51.227
Home, sweet home.

14:51.229 --> 14:53.131
We got a contact ahead.

14:53.133 --> 14:54.771
Stop the Humvee!

15:01.912 --> 15:04.646
This is the first time

15:04.648 --> 15:07.085
Captain Landis
and I met Qasim.

15:09.918 --> 15:13.557
We hit an IED during
a patrol outside Kabul.

15:16.359 --> 15:18.956
It is okay.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.165
You will be all right.

15:24.135 --> 15:25.870
He pulled us to safety.

15:25.872 --> 15:27.838
Watched over us until
our backup came.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.207
He saved our lives.

15:29.209 --> 15:31.712
When was this?
November, 2013.

15:31.714 --> 15:33.280
Landis tracked him down
a few weeks later.

15:33.282 --> 15:35.017
Asked Qasim to work
alongside us as a translator

15:35.019 --> 15:36.952
for the remainder
of our deployment.

15:36.954 --> 15:40.617
You ever doubt his intentions?
Never. When you serve

15:40.619 --> 15:43.059
alongside someone, you get
to know who they really are.

15:43.061 --> 15:46.596
Qasim put his life on the line
for us every single day.

15:46.598 --> 15:48.028
He's family.
Why'd you

15:48.030 --> 15:49.195
bring him into the country?

15:49.197 --> 15:50.763
When word gets out of
locals aiding U.S. troops,

15:50.765 --> 15:52.601
they become targets.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.032
Qasim was in danger.
We couldn't leave him behind.

15:56.569 --> 15:59.900
Landis and I
forged an I.D.,

15:59.902 --> 16:02.506
altered
a travel manifest,

16:02.508 --> 16:04.135
brought him on our
transport home

16:04.137 --> 16:06.532
and have been looking out
for him ever since.

16:06.534 --> 16:09.035
I know it was
against regulations.

16:09.037 --> 16:10.370
Oh, it goes way
beyond that, Gunny.

16:10.372 --> 16:12.602
Why didn't Qasim apply for
a Special Immigrant Visa?

16:12.604 --> 16:14.170
Those take months, if not years,
of red tape.

16:14.172 --> 16:15.506
He didn't have
that kind of time.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.745
That's not your call to make.

16:19.243 --> 16:20.481
Gibbs.

16:23.284 --> 16:25.556
Yeah, yeah, go.
Take DiNozzo.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.460
Gonna be a fallout
from this, Gunny.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.033
I'm prepared to own up
to my actions.

16:38.035 --> 16:41.865
I just ask that you let me see
Qasim before I'm taken away.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.335
There was something that
Landis wanted me to give him

16:44.337 --> 16:46.903
and I need to honor that.

16:49.503 --> 16:51.204
<i> Bishop, stop checking</i>
<i>your watch.</i>

16:51.206 --> 16:52.836
Take a breath,
breathe it in.

16:52.838 --> 16:55.676
Well, she said 15 minutes.
It's been 30.

16:55.678 --> 16:57.978
Which NSA nerd
is this again?

16:57.980 --> 16:59.741
Martinez. Remember?

16:59.743 --> 17:01.676
She helped us out with
the Parsa case last year.

17:01.678 --> 17:05.042
Oh, yeah, she's sassy.
This ought to be interesting.

17:05.045 --> 17:08.242
Sorry I'm late. The president's
motorcade turned Seventh

17:08.243 --> 17:09.608
into a parking lot. Hi.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.175
Martinez, you remember...
DiNozzo.

17:11.178 --> 17:13.550
Yes.
Very Special Agent DiNozzo.

17:13.551 --> 17:15.845
How could I forget?
Ah, It's good to see you again,

17:15.847 --> 17:16.823
Miss Moneypenny.

17:16.847 --> 17:18.579
Can you believe
they killed off Judi Dench?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.479
She was perfection as M.

17:20.481 --> 17:22.877
Perfection.
I can't talk about <i> Skyfall.</i>

17:22.878 --> 17:24.613
Dame them!

17:24.615 --> 17:26.483
Now we're stuck with Voldemort.
Oh!

17:26.486 --> 17:28.051
Do not get me started.

17:28.054 --> 17:30.019
Okay, can we get back
on track here?

17:30.021 --> 17:31.953
Come on.
Oh, turn that scowl

17:31.955 --> 17:33.986
upside down, Bishop.
I come bearing gifts.

17:33.988 --> 17:36.152
An informant of mine
in Pakistan forwarded me

17:36.154 --> 17:38.159
a communiqué that had been
circulating within the ranks

17:38.161 --> 17:39.958
of the Taliban.
Word's on the street

17:39.960 --> 17:43.427
it originated from
Rasheed Naasir's camp.

17:43.429 --> 17:46.162
- That's Qasim.
- And Captain Landis.

17:46.164 --> 17:47.930
It's a call to arms,

17:47.932 --> 17:51.529
condemning Qasim for being a
traitor and U.S. sympathizer.

17:51.531 --> 17:54.038
Rasheed put a bounty on
his own brother's head.

17:54.039 --> 17:56.031
That's a new
level of family dysfunction.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.703
And when did you learn
Arabic, Rosetta Stone?

17:58.705 --> 18:00.975
I was a deployed analyst in
the Middle East. You knew that.

18:00.977 --> 18:02.974
This is why
Captain Landis was tortured.

18:02.976 --> 18:05.372
He was the key to finding Qasim.
That's who the real target is.

18:05.374 --> 18:07.972
And our killer is still after him.
I'll call Gibbs.

18:07.974 --> 18:10.902
Hey, Martinez, let me
ask you a question.

18:10.904 --> 18:13.278
What do you think of this guy?
Mamma Mia.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.806
Very nice.

18:14.808 --> 18:17.447
<i>Et Tu,</i> Martinez?

18:23.856 --> 18:26.353
What are you doing here?
It's all right, Qasim,

18:26.355 --> 18:27.449
I told 'em the truth.

18:27.451 --> 18:29.048
We need to talk
to you about Landis.

18:29.050 --> 18:31.022
I swear I did
not hurt him.

18:31.024 --> 18:34.220
I know. NCIS suspects it was
someone hired by your brother.

18:34.222 --> 18:37.354
Rasheed put a hit
out on you.

18:38.324 --> 18:40.288
Captain Landis
got in the way.

18:42.394 --> 18:44.159
You don't seem surprised.

18:44.161 --> 18:46.326
Nothing my brother does
surprises me.

18:47.831 --> 18:51.564
All my mother and father
wanted was peace.

18:51.566 --> 18:54.531
The Taliban
called it resistance.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.761
But they didn't
kill my parents.

18:58.129 --> 18:59.598
Rasheed did.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.565
He had already
been turned.

19:02.567 --> 19:06.270
I tried to break Rasheed
from their control,

19:06.272 --> 19:09.205
but it was too late.

19:09.207 --> 19:11.309
So I fled to Kabul.

19:11.311 --> 19:13.444
I went into hiding.

19:13.446 --> 19:15.076
Why help the Marines?
I could not

19:15.078 --> 19:17.749
sit back any longer
while people like Rasheed

19:17.751 --> 19:19.212
tore my country apart.

19:19.214 --> 19:21.052
I needed to fight back.

19:21.054 --> 19:22.051
You did, Qasim.

19:22.053 --> 19:24.682
Be proud of that.

19:26.388 --> 19:28.321
I know Landis was.

19:28.323 --> 19:30.560
He told me if anything
ever happened to him,

19:30.562 --> 19:32.159
he wanted you to have these.

19:35.392 --> 19:37.397
His dog tags.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.961
Landis...

19:44.963 --> 19:47.432
was more a brother to me

19:47.434 --> 19:50.535
than Rasheed ever was.

19:59.882 --> 20:01.218
<i> At 0600,</i>

20:01.220 --> 20:04.020
a military convoy was
ambushed in Kabul.

20:04.022 --> 20:08.064
One Marine, Corporal Collins,
was taken hostage by insurgents.

20:08.066 --> 20:10.929
A video of their demands was
uploaded about an hour ago.

20:10.931 --> 20:15.535
My name is Rasheed Naasir
and my demand is simple.

20:15.537 --> 20:18.006
Return my brother
to Afghanistan,

20:18.008 --> 20:20.140
and I will release your Marine.

20:20.142 --> 20:24.169
If Qasim
is not in Kabul to stand trial,

20:24.171 --> 20:26.473
then his sentence
will be delivered

20:26.475 --> 20:28.640
upon my hostage.

20:30.144 --> 20:32.940
You have 48 hours.

20:34.509 --> 20:37.674
Marine patrols are searching
for Rasheed's location.

20:37.676 --> 20:39.610
Time's a factor, Gibbs.

20:39.612 --> 20:42.482
We need to coordinate
transport for Qasim.

20:42.484 --> 20:43.606
Excuse me?

20:43.630 --> 20:45.083
These are orders from the
State Department, Gibbs.

20:45.084 --> 20:46.650
It's out of my hands.

20:46.652 --> 20:50.658
What, the United States now
cowers to terrorist demands?

20:50.660 --> 20:52.891
I don't like it
any more than you do,

20:52.893 --> 20:55.163
but a Marine's life
is on the line.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.835
So is Qasim's.

21:33.837 --> 21:35.835
Can't sleep?

21:35.837 --> 21:38.136
The last time I flew,

21:38.138 --> 21:40.799
Landis brought me
to your country.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.838
I was terrified.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.636
So much uncertainty.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.443
Unlike now--
I know what awaits me.

21:49.445 --> 21:51.842
We'll find another way, Qasim.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.811
My brother doesn't negotiate.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.444
Neither does Gibbs.

21:56.855 --> 21:58.981
I do not want

21:58.983 --> 22:01.986
any more bloodshed
because of me.

22:01.988 --> 22:05.783
If sacrificing my life
will save that Marine,

22:05.785 --> 22:08.288
then it should be done.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.728
Why does one life
outweigh another?

22:11.730 --> 22:13.625
So many have died

22:13.627 --> 22:14.833
fighting for peace--

22:14.835 --> 22:17.297
American, Afghan,
Iraqi, Pakistani.

22:17.299 --> 22:20.105
Their lives matter equally.

22:20.107 --> 22:23.239
We are not going to abandon you.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.975
We owe it to you.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.240
We owe it to all of them.

22:30.177 --> 22:34.477
Where were you assigned,
Agent Bishop?

22:35.415 --> 22:37.947
Pakistan and Afghanistan.

22:37.949 --> 22:40.344
How long?

22:40.346 --> 22:43.952
18 months as an NSA analyst.

22:43.954 --> 22:45.785
Computer nerd.

22:45.787 --> 22:48.257
Not much of a threat to anyone.

22:49.563 --> 22:52.729
But you've seen it up close.

23:00.369 --> 23:03.736
Who did you lose, exactly?

23:05.809 --> 23:08.038
A coworker.

23:09.439 --> 23:12.109
A few years ago.

23:15.015 --> 23:18.653
It stays with you,
doesn't it?

23:19.855 --> 23:22.516
It's a heavy burden
to bear alone.

23:24.884 --> 23:27.018
Look...

23:27.020 --> 23:29.456
I focus on the analytic aspects
of things.

23:29.458 --> 23:31.318
That's where I'm effective.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.621
That's how I can best
help people.

23:34.726 --> 23:37.523
And who is it
that helps you?

23:41.826 --> 23:46.368
It's what we don't say...

23:46.370 --> 23:48.704
that weighs the most.

23:53.242 --> 23:56.440
I hope you find the answers
you are looking for.

24:11.755 --> 24:13.982
Abby...

24:16.215 --> 24:17.379
The Gibbsian glare.

24:17.381 --> 24:19.018
That's what I was waiting for.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.481
Can you guess what I'm waiting for?
A lead?

24:20.483 --> 24:21.847
Because I have one.

24:21.849 --> 24:23.517
I identified the type of knife

24:23.519 --> 24:25.180
used to kill Captain Landis.

24:25.182 --> 24:28.956
Meet the Ka-Bar
Becker Eskabar.

24:28.958 --> 24:30.387
The customized

24:30.389 --> 24:32.027
black paracord on the handle

24:32.029 --> 24:33.955
matches the fibers found
on our victim.

24:33.957 --> 24:36.131
It's customized?
Yeah.

24:36.133 --> 24:38.330
This model was sold exclusively

24:38.332 --> 24:40.994
to U.S. military personnel,
contractors,

24:40.996 --> 24:43.097
and private defense companies.

24:43.099 --> 24:44.335
Which means our
suspect pool

24:44.337 --> 24:46.701
went from zero to
several thousand.

24:46.703 --> 24:49.532
All right.
Thanks, Abbs.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.429
Déjà vu?

25:17.566 --> 25:19.762
Yeah, you could say that.

25:19.764 --> 25:20.865
Qasim!

25:30.244 --> 25:31.674
They look like family.

25:31.676 --> 25:33.946
They are.

25:33.948 --> 25:36.283
Agent Gibbs, Agent Bishop.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.115
Welcome to Kabul.
Colonel.

25:38.117 --> 25:40.219
We haven't turned up any sign of Rasheed
or where he's holding Corporal Collins.

25:40.221 --> 25:42.283
What's your plan?
Patrols have been doubled

25:42.285 --> 25:43.851
and my men are conducting
building sweeps.

25:43.853 --> 25:45.091
We'll flush Rasheed out.
His deadline?

25:45.093 --> 25:47.925
I have no doubt
Rasheed will make contact soon.

25:47.927 --> 25:49.764
His scouts are everywhere.

25:49.766 --> 25:51.563
He already knows
his brother's arrived.

25:51.565 --> 25:53.930
Turning over Qasim
is not an option.

25:53.932 --> 25:56.297
That's not what we do to our own.
Good.

25:56.299 --> 25:58.168
We're not waiting around for him
to make the next move.

25:58.170 --> 25:59.539
<i>Okay.</i>

25:59.541 --> 26:02.278
How many suspects
are we down to, McGee?

26:02.280 --> 26:03.545
Eight hundred.

26:03.547 --> 26:05.882
All right. Okay.

26:05.884 --> 26:07.681
So, what if we just
limit it to suspects

26:07.683 --> 26:09.088
with prior work in Afghanistan?

26:09.090 --> 26:10.319
Oh, what a good idea.

26:10.321 --> 26:12.421
Gee, why didn't we do that
hours ago?

26:12.423 --> 26:13.685
Oh, wait, we did.

26:13.687 --> 26:14.725
Okay, McGee!

26:14.727 --> 26:16.620
Cut me some slack.
You know what hours

26:16.622 --> 26:18.757
of uninterrupted exposure to
these orange walls does to me.

26:18.759 --> 26:20.558
We've got to be missing
something.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.566
Well, considering
the torture techniques

26:23.568 --> 26:26.028
the killer used
on Captain Landis,

26:26.030 --> 26:27.466
I narrowed it down
to individuals

26:27.468 --> 26:29.066
with a background
in interrogation

26:29.068 --> 26:30.602
and close-weapons training.

26:30.604 --> 26:33.276
Interrogation and...

26:37.513 --> 26:39.512
That's it.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.849
The victim's wounds.

26:41.851 --> 26:42.984
What about them?

26:42.986 --> 26:44.288
Allow me to demonstrate.

26:44.290 --> 26:46.455
First he stabbed him here...

26:48.360 --> 26:49.758
And then here.

26:51.432 --> 26:54.325
Then he stabbed him here
and here and here.

26:54.327 --> 26:57.133
Tony...
And here.

26:58.134 --> 26:59.435
And then...

26:59.437 --> 27:01.762
the coup de grâce,
one final blow.

27:10.443 --> 27:12.408
The Duckman

27:12.410 --> 27:14.479
said it was methodical.

27:14.481 --> 27:16.575
The work of a professional.

27:16.577 --> 27:18.478
But killing Captain Landis
wasn't his job.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.246
Finding Qasim was.

27:20.248 --> 27:21.950
He would've been following
our investigation,

27:21.952 --> 27:24.920
waiting for us
to track Qasim down.

27:24.922 --> 27:26.224
Which we did.

27:26.226 --> 27:28.289
Qasim's prints
were in Landis's house

27:28.291 --> 27:29.929
'cause they were friends.

27:29.931 --> 27:30.931
He'd been there before.

27:30.932 --> 27:32.898
The eyewitness
who saw him,

27:32.900 --> 27:34.267
described the assailant
to a tee.

27:34.269 --> 27:36.603
He wanted us to go
down that path.

27:36.605 --> 27:38.875
Is Ken Ashmore listed
in the suspect pool?

27:41.974 --> 27:43.379
Yes, he is.

27:43.381 --> 27:45.579
Ashmore separated
from the Army in 2007,

27:45.581 --> 27:49.210
went to work for WingSpan
Security Forces.

27:49.212 --> 27:51.313
It's a private military company
with such a bad reputation

27:51.315 --> 27:53.320
it was forced to shut down
last year.

27:53.322 --> 27:54.648
Where was he stationed?
Nigeria,

27:54.650 --> 27:56.151
Serbia...

27:56.153 --> 27:58.551
and Kandahar, Afghanistan.

27:58.553 --> 28:00.319
<i>I try to help you</i>

28:00.321 --> 28:01.926
and that makes me a bad guy?

28:01.928 --> 28:03.926
No, it makes you a killer.

28:03.928 --> 28:05.261
Look familiar?

28:05.263 --> 28:06.558
We got a warrant,
searched your home,

28:06.560 --> 28:09.030
found that alongside
several other

28:09.032 --> 28:11.103
questionable weapons
in your arsenal.

28:11.105 --> 28:13.400
I put a call in to a good
friend of mine at the ATF.

28:13.402 --> 28:15.707
She can't wait
to talk to you.

28:15.709 --> 28:17.709
And she's pretty tough.
Have a good time with that.

28:17.710 --> 28:20.884
McGEE: We ran forensics--
turns out your knife is a match

28:20.886 --> 28:22.621
to the one that killed
Captain Landis.

28:22.623 --> 28:23.989
In fact, his DNA

28:23.991 --> 28:26.052
was on the handle.

28:26.054 --> 28:28.124
I'm a patriot.

28:28.126 --> 28:29.860
Okay?

28:29.862 --> 28:31.292
You should be thanking me.

28:31.294 --> 28:33.563
Landis was protecting
a terrorist.

28:33.565 --> 28:35.091
Qasim's not a terrorist,

28:35.093 --> 28:37.130
but the guy
you're working for is.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.898
Rasheed Naasir.

28:38.900 --> 28:40.299
Never heard of him.
McGEE: Really?

28:40.301 --> 28:44.202
Well, the e-mails between
you two suggest otherwise.

28:44.204 --> 28:46.505
You know, the ones you
deleted from your account,

28:46.507 --> 28:48.440
- but forgot to wipe from your cache?
- Yesterday,

28:48.442 --> 28:51.911
after you notified Rasheed
that his brother was in custody,

28:51.913 --> 28:56.815
your bank account got
a magic deposit of $50,000.

28:56.817 --> 28:58.645
Don't worry, we've already
seized those funds.

28:58.647 --> 29:00.949
Win some, lose some.

29:00.951 --> 29:02.813
Hmm.

29:02.815 --> 29:06.355
You must've had
a rough childhood.

29:06.357 --> 29:09.554
You know, normally,
I would take great pleasure

29:09.556 --> 29:13.225
in breaking a clown like you
down nice and slow.

29:13.227 --> 29:15.824
But considering that you
conspired with a terrorist,

29:15.826 --> 29:19.096
and you are responsible
for the torture and murder

29:19.098 --> 29:22.168
of a United States Marine,
I'm a little pissed off

29:22.170 --> 29:23.735
and pressed for time.

29:23.737 --> 29:25.470
Hey, good cop,
you want to step in here?

29:25.472 --> 29:26.533
You're on your own.

29:26.535 --> 29:28.101
You have ten seconds
to tell us

29:28.103 --> 29:29.436
where Rasheed is holding
that hostage,

29:29.438 --> 29:31.371
or I'm going to turn
your patriotic face

29:31.373 --> 29:32.937
all red, white and blue.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.568
I don't know, okay?
One...

29:34.570 --> 29:37.334
Look, our relationship was strictly business.
two, three...

29:37.336 --> 29:39.837
Rasheed wasn't going to trust me
with that kind of information. - four, five...

29:39.839 --> 29:41.436
I'm telling you the truth!

29:41.438 --> 29:43.813
He's not someone you
want to mess with.

29:43.815 --> 29:47.180
And do yourselves a
favor and stand down.

29:48.751 --> 29:51.854
His hostage is as
good as dead,

29:51.856 --> 29:56.358
and so is anyone
who tries to stop him.

29:58.559 --> 30:00.555
<i>Rasheed's operating area</i>
<i>is in Kandahar;</i>

30:00.557 --> 30:02.624
500 kilometers south.

30:02.626 --> 30:03.887
Why strike here?

30:03.889 --> 30:05.695
Make it personal.

30:05.697 --> 30:07.263
This base, these Marines;

30:07.265 --> 30:09.559
he knows what they mean
to Qasim.

30:09.561 --> 30:11.199
Even extremist groups
don't operate

30:11.201 --> 30:13.566
outside their jurisdiction
without permission.

30:13.568 --> 30:16.365
Rasheed must be in league
with a local faction.

30:16.367 --> 30:17.732
Who are the players
in the area?

30:17.734 --> 30:19.339
This is a hot zone,
Agent Gibbs.

30:19.341 --> 30:20.538
It's a long list.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.570
Rasheed would pick
a populated village

30:22.572 --> 30:24.074
to avoid a military
air strike,

30:24.076 --> 30:26.578
but one small enough where
he could maintain a perimeter.

30:26.580 --> 30:28.346
Get the list
to Tony and McGee.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.842
Excuse me, Colonel,
we have a situation.

30:29.844 --> 30:32.575
One of our patrol vehicles
made an unauthorized exit from the base.

30:32.577 --> 30:34.678
I want an immediate muster report.
Already did it, sir.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.150
Everyone's accounted for...
except Qasim.

30:37.152 --> 30:39.654
He was in his rack an hour ago,
but now he's gone.

30:39.656 --> 30:41.054
All I found were these.

30:45.795 --> 30:47.792
Captain Landis's dog tags.

30:47.794 --> 30:50.094
Why would Qasim leave?

30:50.096 --> 30:52.734
To save your Marine.

30:54.304 --> 30:58.304
He's turning himself over
to Rasheed.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.777
Any chance this isn't
the vehicle Qasim took?

31:12.779 --> 31:15.209
They all have GPS locators.
This is it.

31:23.250 --> 31:24.352
He didn't hit an IED.

31:24.354 --> 31:26.624
The blast originated
from inside.

31:26.626 --> 31:27.920
Probably a grenade.

31:27.922 --> 31:30.022
Rasheed's scouts work fast.

31:30.024 --> 31:31.694
There's no body.
They must have taken Qasim

31:31.696 --> 31:33.628
before they torched it--
he may still be alive.

31:33.630 --> 31:36.226
Gibbs!

31:44.334 --> 31:46.227
It's Qasim's gear.

31:47.061 --> 31:49.468
He's been shot.

31:50.672 --> 31:52.607
<i> This is an infrared</i>
<i>satellite image,</i>

31:52.609 --> 31:54.911
taken two weeks ago,
of a Taliban safe house

31:54.913 --> 31:56.712
just outside of Kabul.

31:56.714 --> 31:58.112
I don't see anything.

31:58.114 --> 31:59.745
That's because no heat
signatures were present.

31:59.747 --> 32:01.249
McGEE:
Next graphic, please.

32:01.251 --> 32:03.354
Now, this is a scan
of the same structure,

32:03.356 --> 32:04.619
taken ten minutes ago.

32:04.621 --> 32:06.954
Five were detected
inside the safe house.

32:06.956 --> 32:08.488
Plus an additional
four alongside

32:08.490 --> 32:09.960
the village's access points.

32:09.962 --> 32:11.255
Most likely armed lookouts.

32:11.257 --> 32:12.757
That's Rasheed,
all right.

32:12.759 --> 32:14.325
Get those coordinates to Gibbs.
I'll update SECNAV.

32:14.327 --> 32:15.998
- Will do.
<i>-  With all due respect,</i>

32:16.000 --> 32:18.461
that's a Marine being held
hostage. This is my call.

32:18.463 --> 32:19.868
Our only chance of getting
Collins out alive

32:19.870 --> 32:21.731
is if we strike, now.

32:21.733 --> 32:24.002
If his lookouts spot
a convoy headed their way,

32:24.004 --> 32:26.771
if the corporal's not dead
already, he will be.

32:26.773 --> 32:28.571
Tell me what you're suggesting.

32:28.573 --> 32:30.372
One vehicle, one occupant.

32:30.374 --> 32:32.645
That's not a plan;
that's a suicide mission.

32:32.647 --> 32:34.981
Just one look at you, they're going
to know you're a Marine, Gibbs.

32:34.983 --> 32:36.885
You won't make it five feet
into that village.

32:36.887 --> 32:38.716
I didn't say I was the one
in the vehicle.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.651
Gibbs?

32:42.653 --> 32:44.859
I got your back, Bishop.

32:44.861 --> 32:46.459
Gibbs, wait, we have
to talk about this.

32:46.461 --> 32:47.597
Just did.

32:47.599 --> 32:48.997
What is it you expect me to do?

32:48.999 --> 32:51.028
Take down a village
of insurgents on my own?

32:51.030 --> 32:53.532
Th-Th-that's not me.
I-I'm an analyst.

32:53.534 --> 32:54.931
I thought you were a field agent.
Gibbs...

32:54.933 --> 32:56.235
Whatever lesson
you're trying to teach me

32:56.237 --> 32:57.866
is gonna get Qasim
and Corporal Collins killed!

32:57.868 --> 33:00.066
My job is in there. Not out there!
Your job,

33:00.068 --> 33:02.306
Bishop, is to do
what I tell you to do.

33:03.572 --> 33:04.977
You can do this.

33:04.979 --> 33:06.947
Don't put me in a position
I'm not trained for.

33:06.949 --> 33:08.114
Training's not the
problem, you are.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.516
I told you, I got your back.

33:10.518 --> 33:13.585
Stop hiding behind things
that are familiar, Bishop.

33:13.587 --> 33:15.184
You're better than that.

33:15.186 --> 33:17.048
The answers you want, Bishop?

33:17.050 --> 33:19.486
They're out there.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.588
You read my old file.

33:22.590 --> 33:25.123
That's why
you brought me here.

33:25.125 --> 33:27.784
'Cause of Taj.

33:29.089 --> 33:31.787
He's dead, Gibbs.

33:31.789 --> 33:34.662
I warned Taj.

33:34.664 --> 33:36.599
But he knew the dangers
of being an interpreter.

33:36.601 --> 33:40.462
NSA pulled me out.

33:40.464 --> 33:44.100
There was nothing I could do
for him all the way back in DC.

33:44.102 --> 33:47.771
But you're here now.

33:50.909 --> 33:52.411
<i>What's the status, McGee?</i>

33:52.413 --> 33:53.940
Headed down
the southeast access road,

33:53.942 --> 33:55.779
about one half mile
from the village.

33:55.781 --> 33:57.844
Any increase in security at the perimeter?
Negative.

33:57.846 --> 33:59.883
I hate this part.

33:59.885 --> 34:02.482
Being stuck here,
in this red room, watching,

34:02.484 --> 34:04.449
instead of being there,
backing them up.

34:04.451 --> 34:05.719
I know the feeling.

34:05.721 --> 34:07.087
All right, we have
a visual on our vehicle.

34:07.089 --> 34:09.150
Here we go.

35:26.242 --> 35:29.912
Welcome back, Qasim.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.389
The bullet went through.

35:40.391 --> 35:43.051
You lost quite a bit of blood.

35:43.053 --> 35:45.984
But I stopped it for now.

35:46.993 --> 35:48.988
Why?

35:48.990 --> 35:51.921
You want me dead.

35:52.491 --> 35:54.720
Not by a bullet

35:54.722 --> 35:56.456
from one of my men.

35:56.458 --> 36:00.425
When you die,
it will be at my hands.

36:08.971 --> 36:12.178
Is he dead?

36:14.380 --> 36:18.376
More concern for another's life
than your own.

36:18.378 --> 36:21.752
You are weaker than I remember.

36:21.754 --> 36:23.952
There's been enough
death, Rasheed.

36:23.954 --> 36:26.183
Let him go.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.558
My life for his life.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.093
Honor your word.
“Honor”?

36:31.095 --> 36:33.755
What does a traitor like you

36:33.757 --> 36:35.826
know about honor?

36:35.828 --> 36:39.592
For years, I protected you.

36:39.594 --> 36:41.895
Looked after you.

36:41.897 --> 36:45.629
And you repaid
my love with betrayal.

36:45.631 --> 36:48.364
No, Rasheed, you betrayed us.

36:48.366 --> 36:51.973
We were your family.

36:51.975 --> 36:53.005
This is my family!

36:53.007 --> 36:55.909
Mother and Father forgive you.

36:57.847 --> 37:00.110
I don't need their forgiveness.

37:00.112 --> 37:03.350
I did what needed to be done.

37:03.352 --> 37:05.349
So did I.

37:05.351 --> 37:09.313
And where are your
brothers in arms now, hmm?

37:09.315 --> 37:11.121
You...

37:11.123 --> 37:13.888
will never be one of them,

37:13.890 --> 37:15.152
Qasim.

37:15.154 --> 37:18.391
But you will die like them.

37:43.009 --> 37:44.271
Huh?

37:55.257 --> 37:56.623
Clear!

38:03.129 --> 38:05.159
Grab Qasim and Collins.
Let's move out!

38:13.937 --> 38:16.942
Come on, buddy.

38:21.941 --> 38:23.875
Bishop...

38:25.517 --> 38:27.115
Come on, let's go.

38:29.589 --> 38:31.715
<i>20...</i>

38:31.717 --> 38:33.987
40...

38:33.989 --> 38:36.059
60, 80...

38:36.061 --> 38:37.227
and that's a hundred.

38:37.229 --> 38:39.627
Whoa, wait. I said 200.

38:39.629 --> 38:41.195
Do you want my expert
medical expertise or not?

38:41.197 --> 38:43.964
All right, autopsy gremlin,
but it better be flawless.

38:43.966 --> 38:45.099
I was sewing clothes

38:45.101 --> 38:47.235
for my dolls by the age
of five, Tony.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.004
Stitching is my forte.

38:49.006 --> 38:50.308
Hey, what's going on?

38:50.310 --> 38:51.740
Hey.

38:51.742 --> 38:53.812
I want to apologize. I, um...

38:53.814 --> 38:55.180
I should've been

38:55.182 --> 38:57.213
more supportive of you being

38:57.215 --> 38:59.246
the face of NCIS,
because you're my friend.

38:59.248 --> 39:02.223
And I'm... I'm proud of you.

39:03.089 --> 39:05.223
That means a lot,
coming from you.

39:05.225 --> 39:06.958
Thanks, Tony.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.660
But what exactly does that
have to do with stitches?

39:08.662 --> 39:09.860
Well...

39:09.862 --> 39:12.060
after my failed attempt

39:12.062 --> 39:15.900
to bring Agent McFrankenstein
back to life here,

39:15.902 --> 39:17.900
Jimmy convinced me he was
the man for the job.

39:17.902 --> 39:19.804
There's this technique called
invisible stitching.

39:19.806 --> 39:21.035
So hot right now.

39:21.037 --> 39:22.802
Wow.
Spare no expense, Jimbo.

39:22.804 --> 39:25.472
'Cause I want my friend
to look good as new.

39:25.474 --> 39:28.136
You have no idea
how happy that makes me.

39:28.138 --> 39:29.872
Thank you.

39:30.714 --> 39:31.840
Friendship.

39:31.842 --> 39:33.048
It's important.

39:34.651 --> 39:36.082
Oh, uh, by the way,

39:36.084 --> 39:37.924
now's probably
a good time to mention

39:37.926 --> 39:42.189
I'm not actually
the new face of NCIS.

39:42.191 --> 39:45.029
Happy April Fools', Tony.
What?

39:45.031 --> 39:47.598
He said Happy April Fools'...
I heard him, Jimbo!

39:47.600 --> 39:50.134
Uh, I'm just a little
confused 'cause

39:50.136 --> 39:52.438
April Fool's was weeks ago.
McGEE: Yeah.

39:52.440 --> 39:53.941
That's when we thought of it,
but took time to execute it.

39:53.943 --> 39:55.805
“We”?

39:55.807 --> 39:58.276
You were in on this, too, Jimbo?
I want my money back.

39:58.278 --> 39:59.508
Mm. It's already
down my scrubs.

39:59.510 --> 40:01.077
You wouldn't want it now.
Ready, Tim?

40:01.079 --> 40:02.278
Ready, Jim.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.519
This is not over!

40:04.521 --> 40:06.215
Mark my words!

40:13.793 --> 40:17.327
I've taught them well.

40:26.242 --> 40:28.841
It was a brave thing you did.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.777
Stupid, but... brave.

40:31.779 --> 40:34.754
I could say the same
for you and Agent Gibbs.

40:36.156 --> 40:39.061
I'm sorry about Rasheed.

40:39.063 --> 40:41.861
He made his choice.

40:41.863 --> 40:44.428
One day, when we...

40:44.430 --> 40:46.827
meet on the other side...

40:46.829 --> 40:49.801
I hope to see the boy who once

40:49.803 --> 40:52.168
had love in his heart for me,

40:52.170 --> 40:54.904
as I will for him.

40:54.906 --> 40:57.272
I hope so, too.

41:01.242 --> 41:02.840
Kept an eye on these.

41:02.842 --> 41:05.984
I knew you'd be back for them.

41:11.355 --> 41:14.921
I'm grateful
to have known Landis.

41:14.923 --> 41:17.898
He was a good man.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.466
I think he saw the same in you.

41:24.173 --> 41:26.171
Agent Bishop...

41:26.173 --> 41:28.803
Ellie. My friends call me Ellie.

41:28.805 --> 41:30.979
Thank you, Ellie.

41:32.612 --> 41:34.579
Come on!

41:34.581 --> 41:36.713
Flight leaves in 30, let's go.

41:36.715 --> 41:39.584
Agent Gibbs, please
pass along my gratitude

41:39.586 --> 41:43.185
to the other agents
for catching Landis's killer.

41:43.187 --> 41:44.553
I'm not your messenger.

41:44.555 --> 41:45.553
Do it yourself.

41:45.555 --> 41:47.193
Come on!

41:47.195 --> 41:49.424
Chop, chop!
Let's go! Hustle up!

41:49.426 --> 41:52.562
I... I don't understand.

41:52.564 --> 41:54.700
We put a call in to the
Secretary of the Navy.

41:54.702 --> 41:55.972
It took some convincing,

41:55.974 --> 41:58.237
but after reading over
50 U.S. Marine statements

41:58.239 --> 42:00.173
on your behalf,

42:00.175 --> 42:03.077
she endorsed your Special
Immigrant Visa application.

42:04.816 --> 42:05.816
You're coming with us.

42:05.816 --> 42:08.446
To the United States?

42:08.448 --> 42:10.550
To-to live?

42:10.552 --> 42:12.487
Well, don't go getting
all excited just yet.

42:12.489 --> 42:14.927
You'll be required to work
at a translation post in DC,

42:14.929 --> 42:16.359
while your visa is
being processed.

42:16.361 --> 42:18.024
It's not negotiable.

42:18.026 --> 42:19.328
Where will I be assigned?

42:19.330 --> 42:20.330
NCIS.

42:21.209 --> 42:23.310
I believe I can manage that.

42:23.312 --> 42:24.510
Good.

42:24.512 --> 42:26.709
Good.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.917
Let's go home.
