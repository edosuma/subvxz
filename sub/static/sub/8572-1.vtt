01:32.458 --> 01:34.025
- We rolling?
- Yeah.

01:34.125 --> 01:37.858
All right.
I know I've been a little, uh...

01:37.958 --> 01:41.192
maybe a little stricter than usual
about this kind of thing.

01:41.292 --> 01:44.775
But it's all for a good cause, people.
Sometimes you just have to trust me.

01:44.875 --> 01:48.083
Aren't you rolling? You don't even
have the damn thing plugged in.

01:56.042 --> 01:58.417
I've invited some cameras...

01:59.958 --> 02:03.083
to film our little sermon here today.

02:03.917 --> 02:07.150
'Cause people have been asking,
"What's going on over there at Heaven's Veil?

02:07.250 --> 02:11.442
What are they doing up there at that ranch?
Are they being held against their will?"

02:11.542 --> 02:13.692
- Are you a prisoner here?
- No.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.625
- Are you a prisoner here?
- No.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.942
No. Just smile
for the camera, people. Wave.

02:19.042 --> 02:21.442
Give me this Bible. This Bible...

02:21.542 --> 02:24.917
this here book, this is a tool, people.

02:25.167 --> 02:30.417
And as such, it only has the power
that we ascribe to it.

02:31.083 --> 02:34.673
But you, you are something much different.

02:34.773 --> 02:37.817
Your body is of the earth, yes,
but you are not your body.

02:37.917 --> 02:41.042
You are mightier than the flesh.

02:41.333 --> 02:44.983
We don't need no book to tell us

02:45.083 --> 02:47.650
about the soul!

02:47.750 --> 02:50.525
Did you see any lightning
come down out of that sky?

02:51.842 --> 02:55.567
I've been put here to resurrect
mankind from his fallen state

02:55.667 --> 02:58.567
and bring the power of the etheric realm

02:58.667 --> 03:01.025
back into his hands.

03:01.125 --> 03:05.958
I'm gonna show you, and you,
and you, and every one of ya

03:06.058 --> 03:09.150
how to push your spirit through the veil.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.358
It's a deathless reality,

03:11.458 --> 03:14.233
souls aglow with the ever-real

03:14.333 --> 03:16.567
eternal life!

03:44.083 --> 03:47.442
<i>30 miles outside the town
of Hidden Lake, California,</i>

03:47.542 --> 03:51.442
<i>you'll find this small ranch
known simply as The Veil,</i>

03:51.542 --> 03:54.250
<i>named by the members
of the Heaven's Veil cult,</i>

03:54.350 --> 03:57.153
<i>the cult that lived and died here.</i>

03:57.375 --> 04:01.178
<i>The FBI raided the compound
this morning at 8:52 am,</i>

04:01.278 --> 04:03.563
<i>only to find tragedy.</i>

04:03.663 --> 04:08.675
<i>Every man, woman and child in this
once-thriving community lies dead...</i>

04:08.917 --> 04:12.958
<i>dead at the hands of their leader,
Jim Jacobs.</i>

04:13.083 --> 04:15.500
- Okay, and we're out.
- Pack the mikes.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.648
Wait, what's that?

04:19.625 --> 04:22.608
Everybody, stay back. Come on! Come on!

04:22.708 --> 04:24.817
Hold it! Hold it!

04:24.917 --> 04:27.358
Hey, guys. Stay back.

04:27.558 --> 04:31.333
Don't worry. They're not dead.
He's gonna bring them back.

06:09.117 --> 06:10.758
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I'll do it.

06:10.858 --> 06:14.317
- <i>What? Sarah?</i>
- I said I'll do it.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.333
I'll talk to you.

06:16.433 --> 06:18.950
<i>All right. Thank you, Sarah.</i>

06:35.250 --> 06:38.896
Okay. Would you do me a favor?
Could you just run this up your shirt

06:38.996 --> 06:42.005
and put a...
I'm gonna clip it right there?

06:42.742 --> 06:44.392
Sorry.

06:44.492 --> 06:46.192
- Thanks. Okay, is that good?
- Yep.

06:46.292 --> 06:48.420
All right, guys. Quiet down, please.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.961
Okay. Um...

06:54.083 --> 06:56.667
Why don't we start with your name.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.679
And then we can go from there.

06:58.779 --> 07:00.625
Okay.

07:00.925 --> 07:02.653
Um...

07:04.550 --> 07:07.408
my name is Sarah Hope.

07:07.508 --> 07:10.178
I was... I...

07:10.575 --> 07:14.882
I am the only li... the only known...

07:14.982 --> 07:18.253
survivor of Heaven's Veil.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.542
I have no idea...

07:24.642 --> 07:27.283
why they didn't kill me too.

07:30.758 --> 07:33.100
Did your, um...

07:33.200 --> 07:37.103
Did your parents die there also?

07:39.583 --> 07:42.336
Uh, they must have. I don't know.

07:43.058 --> 07:47.017
I'm not... I'm not sure
who my parents were.

07:47.117 --> 07:50.018
I don't even know my real name.

07:50.118 --> 07:54.203
They named me...
they named me Sarah Hope...

07:54.303 --> 07:56.392
at the hospital.

07:56.492 --> 07:58.303
Uh...

08:00.933 --> 08:05.028
I was in foster care, a lot
of different homes till I was 16.

08:08.108 --> 08:10.742
I think this is me
and my brother and my sister.

08:10.842 --> 08:14.625
But I'm not sure. I was only five.

08:14.725 --> 08:19.711
This is that really famous one,
the one of Jim and his followers.

08:22.933 --> 08:25.761
I know this is really hard,

08:26.692 --> 08:29.470
but there is a reason why we...

08:29.967 --> 08:32.495
reached out to you.

08:32.957 --> 08:35.475
Like I said earlier on the phone,

08:35.575 --> 08:37.509
we found...

08:37.958 --> 08:41.101
something that no one's ever seen before.

08:50.042 --> 08:53.403
Do you see that camera right there?

08:54.142 --> 08:56.286
And right there?

08:57.100 --> 08:59.125
And right there.

08:59.225 --> 09:04.833
They were filming.
But there's no record of anything.

09:05.033 --> 09:07.736
Nothing's ever been released.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.486
And there's this.

09:15.267 --> 09:17.775
They never found this room.

09:17.875 --> 09:21.948
Not in the farmhouse
or any of the buildings.

09:24.450 --> 09:27.636
No one knows what happened that day.

09:28.175 --> 09:30.117
Why did they do it?

09:30.217 --> 09:33.525
I wanna go back out there
and find those films.

09:33.975 --> 09:36.882
Maybe we'd find out what really happened.

09:38.475 --> 09:40.742
We're in this room.

09:40.842 --> 09:43.236
We feel the silence.

09:45.592 --> 09:49.208
There is a time for every season, Mama.

09:49.308 --> 09:53.175
This child has been cut down
before her time.

09:53.975 --> 09:55.752
How long?

09:56.292 --> 09:59.450
How long has your daughter been this way?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.625
- Two years.
- Mmm.

10:03.725 --> 10:06.628
The doctors say she's brain-dead.

10:07.725 --> 10:09.768
Doctors.

10:09.868 --> 10:12.538
Doctors.

10:15.433 --> 10:18.850
The doctors don't want her well, Mama.

10:19.950 --> 10:22.425
They like that money coming in.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.278
No, sir.

10:30.058 --> 10:32.733
The child's mind is not dead.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.703
Will you join hands with me?

10:36.350 --> 10:39.033
We need to create an opening,

10:39.133 --> 10:42.332
close the circuit so the girl...

10:42.432 --> 10:44.933
can find her way back home.

10:45.033 --> 10:48.353
Please. Indulge me.

10:51.367 --> 10:53.220
Please.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.428
Thank you.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.042
There we go. All right.

11:05.342 --> 11:07.639
Now, Mama, I want you to be brave.

11:07.739 --> 11:12.424
Something happened before the child
got lost, about a week before.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.116
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

11:16.216 --> 11:18.800
- No. Nothing.
- Not to her, Mama.

11:18.900 --> 11:21.500
- Nothing.
- To you.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.533
To you.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.000
Something so terrible,
it froze your heart,

11:26.100 --> 11:30.050
and you swore you'd never tell a living soul,
mother. But the spirit sees all.

11:30.175 --> 11:34.458
The spirit knows all.
The spirit understands all.

11:34.558 --> 11:37.592
Now whisper it.
Whisper it to me. Let it out.

11:37.692 --> 11:40.708
- No. No.
- Let it out.

11:41.108 --> 11:42.911
Whisper.

11:44.308 --> 11:47.270
Whisper it in my ear!
Give it to me! Tell me the truth.

11:47.370 --> 11:51.180
The truth! The real truth! Now!

12:01.483 --> 12:04.042
He's going down! Get his head.
I got his feet.

12:04.142 --> 12:06.208
- Grab him.
- Hold him.

12:06.308 --> 12:10.061
I've got his head. Rotate him. Look out.

12:40.542 --> 12:44.762
- So, how long have you guys worked together?
- Just long enough to talk us into this.

12:46.108 --> 12:48.858
We actually met in film school,
so we've done everything together...

12:48.958 --> 12:52.639
- industrials, um, web series...
- Infomercials.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.883
- Once. We did one infomercial.
- "Your skin will practically glow."

12:55.983 --> 12:59.008
- That was the best payday we ever had.
- Yeah, for three days of hell.

12:59.108 --> 13:02.628
Uh, excuse me. I'm pretty sure
you slept with the spokesmodel.

13:02.728 --> 13:04.483
- Hey, she was very smart.
- Oh!

13:04.583 --> 13:06.345
She reads books.

13:09.458 --> 13:11.425
But this film?

13:11.525 --> 13:12.942
This is different.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.958
We've wanted to make
this film for a long time.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.833
Why is it so important to you?

13:18.933 --> 13:21.428
Wait, you didn't tell her?

13:25.183 --> 13:28.858
Uh, our dad, he led the FBI team that day,

13:28.958 --> 13:32.822
the day when everyone, um...

13:33.192 --> 13:34.900
Died.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.517
Our dad was never really
the same after that.

13:38.617 --> 13:43.381
- Neither was our mom.
- So that's why you have all those photos.

13:45.317 --> 13:47.628
That's why we're here.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.936
Look at this guy.

14:03.337 --> 14:07.225
Mr. Wheeler, hi.
Maggie, from the documentary.

14:07.325 --> 14:08.409
Uh-huh.

14:08.509 --> 14:11.107
Thank you so much for letting us
shoot on your property. I know this...

14:11.207 --> 14:14.828
Twenty-five years,
I kept folk away from here.

14:15.358 --> 14:18.251
Who are all these folks?
Thought it was just you.

14:18.351 --> 14:21.250
Oh, no, uh, this is my crew.

14:21.350 --> 14:23.875
- Christian, my brother, is the editor.
- Hello, sir.

14:23.975 --> 14:26.750
Nick is our gaffer. Matt's our cameraman.

14:26.850 --> 14:28.375
- Ed, grip.
- What's up?

14:28.475 --> 14:31.392
Jill does sound, and Ann is our PA.

14:31.492 --> 14:34.211
- And this is Sarah Hope.
- I know who she is.

14:37.742 --> 14:39.983
Thought it was you.

14:40.083 --> 14:44.453
Bound to come back home.
Was wondering if you ever would.

15:37.450 --> 15:39.545
Oh, wow.

15:48.550 --> 15:51.000
- Hey, hey. Get this.
- What? Okay.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.167
Get down. Get down.

17:06.392 --> 17:09.483
- Oh, shit.
- Sarah! Sarah!

17:10.099 --> 17:12.958
- Sarah?
- Is she okay?

17:13.058 --> 17:16.502
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

17:18.092 --> 17:21.836
I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't be here.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.797
All right, we'll set up camp over there.

17:38.142 --> 17:40.036
Thanks.

17:40.833 --> 17:44.675
Can you imagine how weird
this must be for her to be back here?

17:45.175 --> 17:47.603
She's the one that made it out.

17:52.975 --> 17:55.818
My whole life has been defined
by this place...

17:57.925 --> 18:00.148
by what happened.

18:03.008 --> 18:04.920
It's the same for me.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.867
After it all happened, I, um...

18:10.975 --> 18:14.714
I was only three at the time, but...

18:15.114 --> 18:17.350
my father, uh...

18:17.950 --> 18:20.236
killed himself.

18:21.408 --> 18:22.820
What?

18:25.575 --> 18:28.695
I found him hanging in the garage.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.889
I thought he was playing a game.

18:42.683 --> 18:45.891
We both lost our families
because of this place.

18:48.483 --> 18:50.886
I need to know why.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.594
Sarah. Sarah.

20:08.767 --> 20:09.803
Sarah.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.750
Ed? Ed!

20:34.850 --> 20:37.074
Ed! Do you see him down there?

20:37.174 --> 20:40.308
- No, he's not over here.
- Ed! Ed!

20:40.408 --> 20:42.500
Ed, stop messing around!

20:42.600 --> 20:45.381
Sarah, have you seen Ed?

20:45.481 --> 20:47.717
He's gotta be around here someplace.
He left all of his stuff.

20:47.817 --> 20:50.042
His wallet is right there.
He couldn't have gone far.

20:50.142 --> 20:54.917
- Ed, where the hell are you?
- Ed! Ed, breakfast is ready!

20:55.017 --> 20:57.228
- Yeah, that should get him.
- Maggie!

20:57.328 --> 21:00.297
- I'm gonna look up front.
- Come take a look at this.

21:01.197 --> 21:02.858
All right, what is it?

21:02.958 --> 21:06.367
I don't know. Um, just look here.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.311
Who moved the camera?

21:13.158 --> 21:15.825
Look right there.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.533
Look at that. We got a ghost. Wow.

21:18.633 --> 21:22.583
- Nick, it's not a ghost.
- What, you don't believe in ghosts?

21:22.683 --> 21:24.820
And watch this part.

21:27.558 --> 21:30.031
That's where Ed was sleeping.

21:34.450 --> 21:38.633
- The van's gone. It's gone.
- What do you mean it's gone?

21:38.733 --> 21:41.786
- What?
- Let's have a look.

21:43.933 --> 21:47.095
- Oh, what the fuck?
- This isn't like him.

21:47.195 --> 21:49.425
I know. He's a grumpy fucker,
but he's not a quitter.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.858
We crawled through swamps with this guy.
There's no way he'd bail on us.

21:51.958 --> 21:54.167
- Looks like he did.
- What do we do now?

21:54.267 --> 21:56.617
- Has anybody got any bars?
- I'm trying, but I got nothing.

21:56.717 --> 21:58.618
- What do we do? Go back?
- No. We don't go back.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.958
We have, like, 80 grand
worth of equipment in there.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.733
- That's 80 grand we do not have.
- Yeah, exactly.

22:03.833 --> 22:06.853
Well, someone's gotta
go down for some help.

22:12.358 --> 22:14.042
Me?

22:14.142 --> 22:16.250
Yeah. You're the PA.

22:16.350 --> 22:19.958
You're gonna send me down there
to walk 20 miles, probably till dark?

22:20.058 --> 22:22.958
God, don't exaggerate.
It's 16 miles. This one.

22:23.058 --> 22:26.311
Ann, it's okay. Nick will go.

22:27.567 --> 22:30.009
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Matt'll cover for you.

22:30.109 --> 22:33.557
- You'll be down before dark.
- Well, thanks, pal.

22:34.357 --> 22:37.125
- Fine.
- No, wait. I'll come with you.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.692
Oh. I thought you didn't wanna go.

22:39.792 --> 22:43.517
It's better than staying up here
with that creepy farmer guy out there.

22:44.217 --> 22:45.550
- All right.
- What?

22:45.650 --> 22:48.867
- Be careful.
- I'll keep an eye out for inbred farmers.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.350
No, Nick, she needs to be careful of you.

22:51.450 --> 22:52.958
Oh!

22:53.058 --> 22:55.678
- Ow, Maggie. Ow.
- Stop it.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.000
Let's set up the next interview
by the church.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.895
- You gonna need both cameras?
- Yeah.

23:02.942 --> 23:05.470
We need to go across the lake.

23:06.550 --> 23:09.017
Hmm? Across the lake?

23:09.417 --> 23:11.585
I remembered something.

23:44.575 --> 23:46.786
Are you seeing this?

23:53.050 --> 23:55.792
It's a strip that's shallow.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.498
Come on. Goes all the way across.

23:58.598 --> 24:00.511
Let's go.

24:13.058 --> 24:16.895
Sarah? Where are we going?

24:18.433 --> 24:20.611
To that place.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.878
And you think this is it?

24:42.217 --> 24:44.683
I remember it now.

24:45.183 --> 24:47.986
It was Jim's special place.

25:39.367 --> 25:41.228
Ugh.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.543
No lights.

26:38.970 --> 26:42.337
- I hate rats.
- Not my favorite either.

27:27.353 --> 27:29.987
Oh, I have another one
right here in my pack.

27:30.087 --> 27:34.020
It's, like... It's inside, like,
the flashlight pouch. Right there.

27:39.553 --> 27:41.662
Here they are.

27:42.162 --> 27:45.050
These are the films you were looking for.

27:50.012 --> 27:52.378
- Whoa!
- Sarah, are you okay?

27:52.878 --> 27:55.212
Wha... Yeah.
I think I fell through this chair.

27:55.312 --> 28:00.030
- What do you mean, you fell through it?
- My hand went through the leather.

28:06.742 --> 28:09.781
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

28:18.287 --> 28:21.096
Come here, Sarah. Come here. Come here.

28:21.196 --> 28:23.470
Give me your hand.

28:28.470 --> 28:32.056
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Fuck.

28:38.514 --> 28:40.395
Okay.

28:40.495 --> 28:43.420
Well, Maggie...

28:43.520 --> 28:46.362
clearly nobody ever found this place.

28:46.562 --> 28:50.157
There's no way we would have found
this place if it wasn't for her.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.823
What do you think?

28:59.153 --> 29:01.878
We're gonna need to get
some lights on in there.

29:02.578 --> 29:04.270
It's actually in pretty good shape.

29:04.370 --> 29:07.895
- If it's got fuel. Here we go.
- Careful.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.006
Let's check it out.

29:28.995 --> 29:31.620
- Oh! God!
- God.

29:33.603 --> 29:35.728
Why don't you try another switch?

29:35.828 --> 29:38.131
Why don't you try another switch?

30:16.420 --> 30:17.756
Ugh.

30:23.595 --> 30:25.453
Here they are.

30:25.553 --> 30:28.640
We can watch 'em
if I can get this to work.

30:32.803 --> 30:35.595
- Look at this.
- What?

30:35.695 --> 30:37.215
Oh, wow.

30:43.153 --> 30:45.325
Hey! No, no, no! Don't touch that.

30:45.425 --> 30:48.712
I'm sorry. It's just, you know...
it's just that it's next to a body

30:48.812 --> 30:50.653
and it's probably evidence
of some kind of crime,

30:50.753 --> 30:54.848
and if you touch it with all your hands...

31:01.278 --> 31:03.087
Whatever is on this tape...

31:03.187 --> 31:06.145
Should go to the police
because it's evidence.

31:06.245 --> 31:11.266
- We're not gonna take it to the police.
- Maybe we should. But not right away.

31:11.770 --> 31:14.312
All right, we should...
It's entirely decomposed.

31:14.412 --> 31:18.431
If you wanna enable yourself
into doing whatever you do.

31:33.862 --> 31:37.687
That's Karen Sweetzer,
the nurse that followed Jim.

31:39.087 --> 31:41.450
The one they never found.

31:41.550 --> 31:43.540
<i>I got away.</i>

31:44.428 --> 31:47.570
<i>They... they tried to get me.</i>

31:47.670 --> 31:49.178
<i>But I got away.</i>

31:49.278 --> 31:52.913
- When did she record this?
- Must be after the FBI raid.

31:53.013 --> 31:56.245
<i>They're gonna...
they're gonna come get me.</i>

31:56.345 --> 32:00.076
<i>They wanna control me like I'm a puppet.</i>

32:02.295 --> 32:06.598
<i>They want in,
but I'm not gonna let anybody in.</i>

32:07.512 --> 32:09.923
<i>Do you hear that, Jim?</i>

32:11.437 --> 32:15.769
<i>I will not let anybody in.
I didn't come here to be taken.</i>

32:15.869 --> 32:20.144
<i>Even if they get in, they won't get me.</i>

32:32.170 --> 32:34.193
<i>Sarah.</i>

32:35.870 --> 32:38.564
<i>I want you to...</i>

32:40.653 --> 32:43.270
<i>ch... ch...</i>

32:56.612 --> 33:00.020
She looked, like, um, drugged, you know.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.978
Yeah.

33:02.228 --> 33:05.103
She's so manic. I mean, so paranoid.

33:05.203 --> 33:10.098
What was she talking about?
That the FBI was gonna use her like a puppet?

33:11.187 --> 33:13.840
She was so loyal to the end.

33:23.587 --> 33:26.195
<i>I have become what never fails.</i>

33:26.295 --> 33:30.892
<i>And the dead
shall be raised incorruptible.</i>

33:31.212 --> 33:34.348
<i>And we shall be changed.</i>

33:41.545 --> 33:44.565
We need to watch the rest of those films.

33:45.378 --> 33:48.420
- You got the whole thing in frame?
- Yeah, it looks great.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.385
It works. We just need a new bulb.

33:52.587 --> 33:55.092
Sure there's a Kmart around.

34:08.670 --> 34:11.040
Oh, look at this.

34:13.878 --> 34:17.241
- "Pancuronium bromide."
- It's for lethal injections.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.943
It... halts the respiratory system.
Your lungs stop working.

34:21.043 --> 34:23.130
You suffocate.

34:24.853 --> 34:27.420
Hey. Hey.

34:27.520 --> 34:30.445
Be careful with those.
They don't have needle guards.

34:30.545 --> 34:34.277
Seriously? Why are you touching needles?

34:34.378 --> 34:35.870
- Sorry.
- Don't touch...

34:35.969 --> 34:39.333
- Don't touch anything.
- Sorry. I wasn't gonna touch the top.

34:42.045 --> 34:43.956
Jim's room.

34:46.328 --> 34:48.594
Seems about right.

34:48.995 --> 34:50.719
Ugh.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.672
Fuck station Partridge Family.

34:55.353 --> 34:57.778
You guys, why don't we just
go back down to the compound?

34:57.878 --> 35:00.168
We can wait for Nick and Ann,
we can figure everything out there?

35:00.268 --> 35:03.112
How about we just look
for the projector bulbs?

35:03.212 --> 35:05.088
Sorry.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.990
Projector bulb!

35:21.712 --> 35:24.437
Uh, okay, I loaded up the earliest film.

35:24.537 --> 35:27.993
- All right. Rolling.
- Here we go.

35:32.237 --> 35:37.023
- All right, is it filming?
- Uh, yeah, I hear it.

35:38.028 --> 35:42.595
Well, when we get the new cameras
we'll be able to check it right away.

35:42.695 --> 35:45.283
And how are they different?

35:45.383 --> 35:47.362
Uh, they're new video cameras.

35:47.462 --> 35:51.820
You can buy the tapes
at the supermarket... $24.99.

35:51.920 --> 35:56.456
You don't have to send it all
in to Kodak and... I...

35:59.578 --> 36:02.520
Okay, Jim. Whenever you're ready.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.973
This is film number one.

36:06.428 --> 36:10.945
I'm Jim Jacobs, and we're here
at Heaven's Veil ranch.

36:11.045 --> 36:13.733
It's December 11, 1982.

36:13.833 --> 36:17.095
When we started here,
there was just a few of us.

36:17.195 --> 36:21.131
Small group of seven. A family.

36:23.337 --> 36:26.491
There's a small town in Indiana.

36:26.591 --> 36:30.845
Whenever I think of it,
a great deal of pain comes.

36:30.945 --> 36:34.295
As a child, I was undoubtedly
one of the poor.

36:34.395 --> 36:36.012
Never accepted.

36:36.112 --> 36:40.540
Born, as it were,
on the wrong side of the tracks.

36:40.887 --> 36:44.458
And when I was very small,
I lost my father and my mother

36:44.558 --> 36:47.403
to an unholy fire, they tell me.

36:47.503 --> 36:53.272
I knew too early the pain
of suffering, the pain of loss.

36:53.803 --> 36:57.968
But tragedy can beget transformation.

36:58.845 --> 37:04.542
I believe that mankind
is on the cusp of a new reality,

37:04.642 --> 37:08.903
one that transcends pain, suffering,

37:09.003 --> 37:11.098
even death.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.512
I've discovered that the spiritual nature

37:14.612 --> 37:17.870
is attached to the human form
at certain points,

37:17.970 --> 37:20.862
represented by the three nails
of the crucifixion.

37:20.962 --> 37:23.945
And by three alchemical initiations,

37:24.045 --> 37:26.678
I can now draw these nails

37:26.778 --> 37:32.315
and permit the divine nature of man
to come down from its cross.

37:32.528 --> 37:36.595
I can release the nails
that pin the spirit to the body

37:36.695 --> 37:40.285
and free the soul from its mortal coil.

37:41.578 --> 37:43.862
Jim is in a meditative state.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.612
Once he reaches full trance,

37:46.712 --> 37:49.720
he will leave his body
in the physical form

37:49.820 --> 37:53.973
and he'll manifest himself
in spirit in this room.

37:56.312 --> 37:58.148
Father?

38:00.753 --> 38:03.123
Father, are you here?

38:07.120 --> 38:09.723
Father, if you are here...

38:10.420 --> 38:12.348
reach out to us.

38:22.037 --> 38:24.641
Reach out to us, Jim.

38:38.453 --> 38:40.317
Jim?

38:40.462 --> 38:43.428
- I don't think he's breathing.
- Jim, come back to us.

38:43.528 --> 38:45.994
Jim, come back to us. Focus.

38:46.094 --> 38:47.677
There you go. There you go.

38:47.777 --> 38:50.732
Slow, controlled.

38:50.832 --> 38:52.470
Okay. That's good.

38:52.870 --> 38:56.528
- Mommy. Mommy. What happened?
- Sarah. Come here.

38:56.628 --> 38:58.995
- Okay.
- Is he okay?

38:59.095 --> 39:02.728
- Yeah, he's okay. What are you doing up?
- I was playing, Mom.

39:02.828 --> 39:06.248
Okay, come. Time to go to bed.

39:18.412 --> 39:20.715
She was my mom.

39:22.337 --> 39:24.781
Karen Sweetzer was...

39:36.670 --> 39:39.112
So horrible.

39:39.412 --> 39:41.345
I mean... Ugh.

39:41.445 --> 39:44.355
So sad for her, and so gruesome.

39:45.045 --> 39:46.870
You know?

39:47.070 --> 39:49.845
I just think deep down...

39:50.545 --> 39:55.076
maybe she was hoping
her mom was still alive...

39:55.576 --> 39:57.465
somewhere.

40:22.162 --> 40:23.998
Mom.

40:25.945 --> 40:28.006
I guess you were my mom.

40:57.795 --> 41:00.812
I am so sorry this happened to you.

41:01.612 --> 41:03.907
I feel like...

41:07.395 --> 41:09.653
like something...

41:09.753 --> 41:12.423
wanted me to come back here...

41:14.170 --> 41:16.798
to bring them here with me, but I...

41:18.362 --> 41:20.956
something about it feels so wrong.

41:27.737 --> 41:29.643
- Sarah!
- Sarah?

41:29.743 --> 41:31.795
Sarah!

41:34.205 --> 41:36.762
What happened? What happened?

41:36.862 --> 41:38.918
What happened?

41:44.962 --> 41:46.837
What happened?

41:47.437 --> 41:49.456
Nothing happened.

41:51.045 --> 41:53.123
Nothing happened.

41:57.670 --> 42:01.181
- Help! Help! Please!
- Matt!

42:01.281 --> 42:04.280
- Guys! We need help!
- Do you hear that?

42:04.380 --> 42:07.181
- It's Nick.
- Help!

42:08.212 --> 42:10.028
- Maggie!
- Maggie!

42:10.128 --> 42:12.603
- Ann?
- Maggie!

42:12.703 --> 42:14.753
What is it? What?

42:16.053 --> 42:17.906
Ed.

42:21.112 --> 42:24.178
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

42:24.278 --> 42:27.403
Oh. He must have been doing 90.

42:27.503 --> 42:30.167
- I guess he missed that curve.
- Why was he going so fast?

42:30.267 --> 42:33.396
- Someone was in the car with him.
- No one was in the car with him.

42:33.496 --> 42:34.920
I told you, that doesn't make any sense.

42:35.020 --> 42:38.045
What are you talking about?
Who was in the car with him?

42:38.445 --> 42:41.500
- Go ahead. Tell her your theory.
- The other air bag blew. Look!

42:41.970 --> 42:45.530
It doesn't matter though. One blows...

42:45.630 --> 42:49.445
- they both blow. That's how it works.
- Besides, who's gonna come up here?

42:49.545 --> 42:53.295
Someone hiked 16 miles to steal a shitty van,
and Ed gives his life to stop 'em?

42:53.395 --> 42:56.999
Goddamn it, you guys.
I can't believe this.

42:58.128 --> 43:00.737
Did you... did you check him?

43:00.837 --> 43:03.856
- I mean, he's for sure dead?
- Yeah.

43:04.803 --> 43:08.781
- Are you sure?
- Feel free to check him again, Maggie.

43:29.753 --> 43:32.223
- Oh, God.
- Shit.

43:34.095 --> 43:36.403
- So we go to the cops, right?
- Yes.

43:36.503 --> 43:39.662
We go to the cops when we can.
There's no way we can make it there by dawn.

43:39.762 --> 43:45.032
- And that farmer's still out there.
- Jesus. Farmer John did not kill Ed, okay?

43:45.637 --> 43:47.720
It's 12 miles down to the main road,

43:47.820 --> 43:52.327
and then it's another 20 miles
to, like, the nearest anything.

43:52.627 --> 43:55.882
Do you guys wanna
walk down in the dark, or...

43:59.253 --> 44:01.490
What about Ed?

44:11.487 --> 44:13.006
Oh, God.

44:31.962 --> 44:34.180
We'll leave in the morning.

44:35.162 --> 44:36.973
Yeah.

44:40.570 --> 44:44.179
Do you remember your mom at all?

44:44.862 --> 44:47.331
I can't remember.

44:48.837 --> 44:51.881
I did always feel
like she wanted me back...

44:52.778 --> 44:55.401
for us to be a family again.

44:57.420 --> 45:01.473
Maybe it's just... wishful thinking.

45:04.145 --> 45:06.298
I don't know, I...

45:07.946 --> 45:10.792
I do feel like the answers
are in that house.

45:12.162 --> 45:14.248
I do too.

45:17.212 --> 45:19.523
You wanna go back?

45:21.137 --> 45:23.012
I do.

45:23.112 --> 45:25.527
Maggie, I thought we just
decided that we were leaving.

45:25.627 --> 45:28.011
We are. In the morning.

45:28.111 --> 45:32.153
We're gonna go back to the house
and watch those films.

45:32.353 --> 45:34.080
Who's coming with?

45:36.045 --> 45:37.220
Christian, come on.

45:37.320 --> 45:40.906
Yeah, no, I was coming.
I was totally coming.

45:41.678 --> 45:43.681
Anyone else?

45:47.028 --> 45:50.868
All right. I guess, uh...
see you guys in the morning.

45:54.337 --> 45:56.103
Seriously?

45:56.353 --> 45:58.780
You guys aren't a little curious?

45:59.420 --> 46:01.259
No.

46:01.359 --> 46:03.461
Not really.

46:04.328 --> 46:06.181
Wait up.

46:08.995 --> 46:11.873
All right, well, I'm not babysitting.

46:14.662 --> 46:17.515
Nick, wait. Oh, come on.

46:22.103 --> 46:26.466
Hey, I know you guys are really tired,
but I kinda need one more thing.

46:27.720 --> 46:31.028
- Can you grab some B-roll for me?
- Now?

46:31.428 --> 46:33.315
Please.

46:41.220 --> 46:43.290
You are obsessed.

46:46.653 --> 46:50.417
Look, Maggie, how far
are we gonna go with this?

46:51.987 --> 46:55.034
We lost our family because of this.

46:55.695 --> 46:57.840
So did she.

46:59.087 --> 47:02.112
So as far as we need to. Right?

47:02.812 --> 47:04.706
Okay.

47:12.203 --> 47:14.423
- We good?
- Yeah.

47:18.528 --> 47:21.730
To be released and come back.

47:22.128 --> 47:25.678
Released and come back.

47:25.778 --> 47:28.270
This is the loop that we must close.

47:28.370 --> 47:32.230
I must journey to the other side,
where I will extract the first nail,

47:32.330 --> 47:36.332
and then I must return
through the golden door...

47:38.170 --> 47:40.348
into my body.

47:40.845 --> 47:44.237
Karen is preparing the first injection.

47:44.637 --> 47:47.761
It's a little cocktail of my own making.

47:48.420 --> 47:52.332
There's some luminous ether
in there, some bismuth...

47:53.420 --> 47:55.817
sodium pentothal.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.881
Some mercury.

48:03.153 --> 48:05.678
Yes, it's quite poisonous.

48:05.778 --> 48:08.370
Why did you create this drug, Jim?

48:08.470 --> 48:10.295
Um...

48:10.945 --> 48:13.308
I'm having trouble...

48:14.045 --> 48:17.820
I'm having trouble conjugating.

48:17.920 --> 48:20.981
Re-conjugating.

48:21.937 --> 48:24.231
Re-conjugating?

48:33.685 --> 48:35.669
Do you hear that?

48:36.195 --> 48:39.582
Yeah. I can't see where it's coming from.

48:40.282 --> 48:42.745
It's not from the film.

48:42.845 --> 48:45.173
Could be from another room?

48:46.087 --> 48:48.262
Communicate with us.

48:48.362 --> 48:50.595
We're here for you. Push through, Jim.

48:50.695 --> 48:53.320
Push through. Come through to us.

48:54.020 --> 48:57.098
Push through, Jim. Push through.

49:33.887 --> 49:37.070
Hello, brothers and sisters.

49:37.170 --> 49:39.320
It's a beautiful day.

49:39.770 --> 49:41.715
Jim, is that you?

49:47.470 --> 49:50.873
The body is nothing but a shell.

49:51.462 --> 49:55.787
A cycle of physical ego...

49:55.887 --> 50:00.112
for us to outgrow and discard...

50:00.212 --> 50:02.792
as we please.

50:21.278 --> 50:24.295
The first nail is ours.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.873
Now what?

50:40.945 --> 50:42.987
I'm not staying in here.

50:44.962 --> 50:47.849
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

50:50.003 --> 50:53.748
Oh, shit. Spark plug's fried.

50:54.237 --> 50:56.870
I don't even think
they make this kind anymore.

50:56.970 --> 51:00.102
I think I saw some
spark plugs in the pantry.

51:00.902 --> 51:02.123
Great.

51:07.620 --> 51:10.673
No, no, I'll go.

51:11.837 --> 51:14.912
- Thank you, Nick.
- Thank you, Nick.

51:15.012 --> 51:17.478
Yeah, I'll say hi to Jim for ya.

51:17.578 --> 51:19.678
They look like this.

51:19.778 --> 51:22.461
Oh, like a spark plug? Yeah, thanks, Matt.

52:18.962 --> 52:20.902
Somebody here?

52:44.528 --> 52:46.570
Okay, if there's somebody here...

52:47.520 --> 52:49.573
show yourself.

53:07.678 --> 53:09.790
All right, look.

53:11.778 --> 53:14.206
We're not here to hurt you, okay?

53:20.512 --> 53:22.603
What do you want?

53:22.703 --> 53:25.070
Sarah.

53:25.370 --> 53:27.698
I said, what do you want?

53:51.045 --> 53:53.506
What's taking him so long?

53:54.153 --> 53:56.282
Hey, Maggie.

53:56.720 --> 53:59.915
If we can fix the generator,
we're going home, right?

54:01.337 --> 54:03.423
Where's Sarah?

54:05.037 --> 54:08.006
- Sarah!
- Sarah?

54:11.462 --> 54:13.945
- Nick!
- Sarah?

54:14.045 --> 54:16.553
We don't have time for this.

54:16.653 --> 54:21.098
- Nick, stop dicking around.
- Nick, come on. This isn't funny, man.

54:27.695 --> 54:30.520
- He went out to the gennie.
- Jesus!

54:30.620 --> 54:32.988
Sarah, you scared the shit out of me.

54:40.003 --> 54:42.362
It just... it just came back on.
I didn't even touch it.

54:43.062 --> 54:45.723
Yeah, it was a breaker inside.

54:52.212 --> 54:54.028
I really don't wanna go back inside.
It's just too...

54:54.128 --> 54:55.537
Too weird?

54:55.737 --> 54:58.452
- Too creepy? Too scary?
- Nick! Stop. I'm serious.

54:58.552 --> 55:01.506
I know, I know. Come here.

55:20.403 --> 55:23.231
Uh, we should probably go...

55:33.503 --> 55:36.037
- Let's use this one.
- Was that from March of '80?

55:36.137 --> 55:39.756
Yeah. Where the hell are Ann and Nick?

55:40.362 --> 55:42.028
Right here.

55:42.128 --> 55:44.395
Oh, hey.

55:44.995 --> 55:47.737
Can you please take these mikes
and put 'em in the other rooms?

55:47.837 --> 55:49.570
- I wanna see what we can pick up.
- Sure.

55:49.670 --> 55:50.873
No problem.

55:51.896 --> 55:55.278
- Great. Thanks.
- Turn 'em on. I just changed the batteries.

55:55.378 --> 55:57.165
You got it.

56:04.828 --> 56:07.445
To be released and come back...

56:07.545 --> 56:12.995
I have refined the formula
to take us further to the other side.

56:13.095 --> 56:18.015
The venom from the African
black mamba is a potent neurotoxin.

56:18.712 --> 56:22.087
Mixed with pancuronium bromide,
which is a lethal agent

56:22.187 --> 56:24.237
used to execute death row inmates.

56:24.537 --> 56:26.845
Just two drops...

56:26.945 --> 56:31.370
will stop the heart in 60 seconds.

56:31.770 --> 56:34.820
After six minutes, brain death.

56:34.920 --> 56:38.278
Without an antidote,
the death rate is 100%.

56:42.587 --> 56:46.578
This is the antidote.
This will bring Jim back to us.

56:47.378 --> 56:51.020
Now, do not, under any circumstances,

56:51.120 --> 56:55.278
administer the antidote
before the full six minutes.

56:55.378 --> 56:57.590
Set the timer, Sam.

57:00.078 --> 57:02.687
Long enough to dance with death,

57:02.787 --> 57:05.465
not so long as to marry her.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.931
He had an antidote.

57:22.278 --> 57:27.265
- Would that even work?
- It could. If done in time.

57:29.253 --> 57:30.995
Jim?

57:32.195 --> 57:34.623
Jim, speak to us.

57:35.653 --> 57:39.038
Jim, speak to us.

57:39.138 --> 57:40.903
Oh, my God, Jim.

57:41.003 --> 57:45.270
- I don't have a heartbeat, Karen.
- Oh, God. Jim, come on.

57:45.370 --> 57:47.495
- Give him the antidote now!
- Use the antidote!

57:47.595 --> 57:50.470
Wait. He said to wait six minutes.

57:50.936 --> 57:54.131
Jim, hang on, okay? We're so close.

58:09.695 --> 58:11.548
Jim!

58:14.916 --> 58:17.695
Jim. Jim. It's me.

58:17.795 --> 58:21.279
- It's me. It's me. I thought we lost you.
- Karen. Karen.

58:21.379 --> 58:26.995
Oh, my... My brothers,
we have removed the second nail.

58:27.295 --> 58:29.795
I have been reborn.

58:29.895 --> 58:32.070
I have been reborn.

58:32.170 --> 58:37.612
My brothers, sisters, I must confess.

58:37.712 --> 58:41.231
I'm not strong enough
to go back there on my own.

58:48.545 --> 58:50.978
- Now we know.
- Yeah, he's a fucking psycho.

58:51.078 --> 58:54.851
It wasn't suicide. They had an antidote.

58:54.951 --> 58:58.998
- Why didn't they use it?
- Something must have gone wrong.

58:59.670 --> 59:01.222
They didn't plan to die.

59:01.322 --> 59:03.587
Yeah, they all thought
that they were coming back.

59:03.687 --> 59:07.348
Jesus, this is such a load of shit.

59:07.878 --> 59:10.656
Let's see if there's anything
on the mikes.

59:13.370 --> 59:16.145
This is from the living room mike.

59:16.245 --> 59:21.778
<i>Oh, my... My brothers,
we have removed the second nail.</i>

59:22.178 --> 59:24.637
<i>I have been reborn.</i>

59:24.737 --> 59:27.129
<i>I have been reborn.</i>

59:27.229 --> 59:30.490
This is track two, dining room.

59:36.762 --> 59:39.056
Three, hallway.

59:46.820 --> 59:49.223
Four, camera room.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.753
Guys, what the fuck was that?
It's haunted! This place is haunted!

01:00:14.853 --> 01:00:16.978
Enough is enough, Maggie.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:00:17.078 --> 01:00:19.276
We will, I promise. But we just...

01:00:19.376 --> 01:00:22.212
But what, Maggie?
Let's just load up our shit and go.

01:00:22.312 --> 01:00:25.466
- Why are we still talking about this?
- But we're so close.

01:00:25.566 --> 01:00:28.070
Close? Close to what, Maggie?

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:30.619
We can't leave.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.437
What do you think we should do?

01:00:33.687 --> 01:00:35.653
You begged me to come here.

01:00:36.453 --> 01:00:38.720
I didn't want to.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.598
You said that we would find answers.

01:00:42.862 --> 01:00:46.100
Well, now I have actually seen my family.

01:00:47.837 --> 01:00:50.195
You can leave.

01:00:50.295 --> 01:00:53.262
You can all leave, but I am staying...

01:00:53.362 --> 01:00:56.956
until I find out why
I was the one who survived.

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:02.345
- Jill, please.
- Maggie, I love you. I do. I just...

01:01:03.045 --> 01:01:05.424
You can keep all my sound stuff.
I ju... You know what?

01:01:05.524 --> 01:01:08.176
When I get down, I'll call for some help.

01:01:11.395 --> 01:01:14.728
Um, you guys are good with the cameras?

01:01:14.928 --> 01:01:18.554
- Matt?
- Somebody's gotta go with her, Maggie.

01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:24.406
Shit.

01:01:25.112 --> 01:01:28.370
Let's digitize the rest of the films,
and we'll leave at sunrise.

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:30.281
Okay.

01:01:39.587 --> 01:01:43.240
Okay, I just need to get this on camera.

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:48.537
Have you heard those voices before?

01:01:50.045 --> 01:01:52.773
Why didn't you tell us, Sarah?

01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:59.140
Would you have believed me?

01:02:00.603 --> 01:02:02.965
What do you wanna do?

01:02:03.903 --> 01:02:06.320
I think we should talk to them.

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.015
Okay.

01:02:23.462 --> 01:02:25.315
Mom.

01:02:27.545 --> 01:02:30.206
Can you speak to us?

01:02:37.828 --> 01:02:39.523
I know you're here.

01:03:01.962 --> 01:03:05.026
I'm here.

01:03:06.903 --> 01:03:08.756
I'm here.

01:03:10.528 --> 01:03:12.415
So talk to me.

01:03:13.487 --> 01:03:15.985
You wanted me.

01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:17.944
- Here I am.
- Sarah.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.862
Bring them to us.

01:03:23.462 --> 01:03:27.697
- I've tried.
- Sarah. I need you.

01:03:31.903 --> 01:03:35.437
As soon as I get home, I'm gonna give
my rÃ©sumÃ© to the Game Show Network.

01:03:35.737 --> 01:03:39.150
You know Maggie. She's not coming down
till she gets exactly what she wants.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.480
- Girl's like a dog with a bone.
- Shit!

01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:44.262
Jill? Jill? Hey, wait, wait!

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:45.928
Jill!

01:03:46.528 --> 01:03:49.653
Where did he go? Ed? Where did he go?

01:03:49.953 --> 01:03:51.790
Oh, my God.

01:03:53.312 --> 01:03:55.026
Oh, God.

01:03:58.778 --> 01:04:00.203
- Matt?
- Yeah?

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:02.695
I think maybe...

01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:05.841
Oh, my God! Ed! Shit!

01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:07.945
Oh, my gosh!

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:11.437
He's gushing blood from his neck.
Gotta hold... hold the wound right there.

01:04:11.637 --> 01:04:15.095
I'm gonna go get something out of my bag.
Put your hand here and hold tight, okay?

01:04:15.295 --> 01:04:17.795
It's okay, Ed. It's okay.

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:20.745
- Hold it tight, Matt!
- You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

01:04:20.845 --> 01:04:23.312
- Hurry the fuck up!
- I got it, I got it. We're gonna switch.

01:04:23.412 --> 01:04:26.037
One, two, three, go.

01:04:26.137 --> 01:04:29.287
I thought he was dead.
Sarah checked him, right?

01:04:29.487 --> 01:04:31.928
Look, all that matters
is that we need to get help.

01:04:32.028 --> 01:04:34.737
I need you to go and get the paramedics.
I can handle this.

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.178
- All right?
- Okay.

01:04:36.278 --> 01:04:37.762
- Go!
- Okay!

01:04:37.862 --> 01:04:41.588
Okay. I need you to hold this, okay?
Can you put your hand there?

01:04:41.688 --> 01:04:45.811
Just gonna get something
to tie it off, okay? I'll be back.

01:04:47.337 --> 01:04:50.370
Okay. Hang on, Ed. One second.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.367
Okay.

01:04:53.212 --> 01:04:57.093
I'm coming.
I'm coming back, all right? Shit.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:01.879
Help!

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:08.137
Stop!

01:05:08.737 --> 01:05:10.552
Help!

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:12.672
Please!

01:06:31.995 --> 01:06:33.862
Sarah!

01:06:34.462 --> 01:06:36.131
Sarah!

01:06:38.503 --> 01:06:40.545
Sarah!

01:06:41.445 --> 01:06:43.531
Where are you?

01:06:49.428 --> 01:06:51.770
<i>I came back.</i>

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:54.737
<i>Like you asked me to.</i>

01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:57.248
<i>Here I am.</i>

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.373
Sarah!

01:08:30.295 --> 01:08:32.245
Sarah!

01:08:32.345 --> 01:08:34.156
Fuck!

01:08:41.444 --> 01:08:43.256
Christian.

01:08:43.712 --> 01:08:45.523
Christian?

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:56.439
- Christian, why didn't you answer me?
- You gotta see this.

01:09:03.987 --> 01:09:08.237
Jesus was nailed to the cross.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:11.002
He wasn't bound.

01:09:11.103 --> 01:09:12.956
He was nailed.

01:09:14.337 --> 01:09:16.395
The spirit...

01:09:17.295 --> 01:09:19.569
is not bound to the body.

01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:22.028
It is nailed.

01:09:22.328 --> 01:09:24.791
Thank you, my darling.

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:29.044
It won't give up its fleshy domain easily.

01:09:29.495 --> 01:09:32.678
But if we release the nails...

01:09:32.778 --> 01:09:35.303
we forge a new reality.

01:09:35.403 --> 01:09:40.734
A deathless world, a new dawn for mankind.

01:09:44.595 --> 01:09:47.389
But, Jim, certainly, the children don't...

01:09:47.488 --> 01:09:49.295
You know, Karen...

01:09:50.194 --> 01:09:53.545
in German, the word for "death"...

01:09:53.645 --> 01:09:55.537
is heimgehen.

01:09:55.637 --> 01:09:59.195
It means "going home."

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:04.803
What better place for the children
than at home?

01:10:05.103 --> 01:10:08.753
The task that we have set before us
is one of the most challenging

01:10:08.853 --> 01:10:12.595
that any group of human beings
has ever had to face.

01:10:12.695 --> 01:10:15.720
It is a task which requires...

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.137
a perfect faith.

01:10:18.237 --> 01:10:20.153
Devotion? No.

01:10:20.253 --> 01:10:22.970
A lifetime of devotion is not enough.

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:26.437
One must have direct experience...

01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:29.737
of the power of spirit.

01:10:30.037 --> 01:10:32.220
Isn't it curious?

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.753
The same tool we use
to pound the nails in,

01:10:34.853 --> 01:10:37.562
we also use to draw the nails out.

01:10:38.795 --> 01:10:40.528
How funny.

01:10:42.642 --> 01:10:46.953
I release the spirit within!
I release the god inside!

01:10:47.053 --> 01:10:50.653
I give birth to the spirit,
and birth is bloody,

01:10:50.753 --> 01:10:54.272
and birth is painful, and there is blood,
and there is pain,

01:10:54.372 --> 01:10:57.478
and you are born into everlasting life!

01:10:57.578 --> 01:11:02.148
- Stop, Jim! Stop it. Sto...
- Back! Get back. Get back, I say!

01:11:02.248 --> 01:11:07.120
Rise up with your spirit
and feel pain no more.

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:11.370
And be released into eternity!

01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:14.631
Arise!

01:11:19.728 --> 01:11:21.265
Arise.

01:11:30.403 --> 01:11:33.528
Yes. Arise.

01:11:33.628 --> 01:11:36.885
Yes! The third nail's ours.

01:11:37.245 --> 01:11:39.428
Ours for the taking!

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:42.670
And immortality is yours, brother.

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:44.603
Forever.

01:11:45.303 --> 01:11:47.373
Yes.

01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.748
Will you follow me?

01:12:00.753 --> 01:12:02.668
Holy fucking shit.

01:12:03.468 --> 01:12:05.673
He's not a fake.

01:12:06.953 --> 01:12:10.740
- He could really...
- You said we came all this way for answers.

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:13.150
Shouldn't we finish?

01:12:22.828 --> 01:12:28.806
Time has come to extract
the last ethereal nail.

01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:35.806
Time will mean nothing to us.

01:12:36.428 --> 01:12:41.865
We'll watch galaxies spin like pinwheels.

01:12:42.278 --> 01:12:44.131
Sam.

01:12:48.670 --> 01:12:51.606
Set the timer to six minutes.

01:12:59.712 --> 01:13:02.581
Just a spoonful of sugar, children.

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:11.887
Now we will all journey to the other side.

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:14.012
I will be your guide.

01:13:14.112 --> 01:13:17.247
And since I cannot
bring you all back at once,

01:13:17.347 --> 01:13:21.845
we will use the antidote that
brought me back my first time.

01:13:21.945 --> 01:13:24.720
And when we return to our bodies,

01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:28.512
we will have a power without measure,

01:13:28.612 --> 01:13:30.778
as you witnessed within me.

01:13:30.878 --> 01:13:34.095
And we will use this power wisely

01:13:34.195 --> 01:13:39.278
to release every soul
from its mortal coil.

01:13:39.978 --> 01:13:41.724
Sam.

01:13:41.824 --> 01:13:45.945
<i>Without death in our lives,
there's no need for fear.</i>

01:13:46.045 --> 01:13:47.912
Children.

01:13:48.112 --> 01:13:50.953
No! No. Give me the cubes.
Give them to me.

01:13:51.053 --> 01:13:54.298
Don't put them in your mouth.
Don't eat them. Don't eat them.

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.545
Sister. Sister. Be calm, sister.

01:13:59.645 --> 01:14:04.966
- Tormented and frightened is your soul.
- Please don't do this to our children, Jim.

01:14:05.562 --> 01:14:07.898
You're their father.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:10.663
Jim's your dad.

01:14:12.587 --> 01:14:15.545
Should we abandon our path?

01:14:15.645 --> 01:14:17.253
No! No.

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:21.349
How many times must I die for you, Karen?

01:14:21.449 --> 01:14:23.885
Please, Jim, I'm scared.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:30.695
<i>Matthew said,
"And fear not them which kill the body,</i>

01:14:30.795 --> 01:14:33.487
<i>but are not able to kill the soul."</i>

01:14:33.587 --> 01:14:36.028
Jim. No, Jim, no!

01:14:36.328 --> 01:14:39.770
Jim! Kids, don't eat them. No, Jim!

01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:42.820
Children, I love you.

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.337
Now, do as I say.

01:14:45.437 --> 01:14:49.703
No! Kids, don't do it.
Kids, don't eat them.

01:14:49.803 --> 01:14:52.120
Jim, stop. No, kids, don't eat them.

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:54.287
Sam, get the antidote ready!

01:14:54.387 --> 01:14:56.802
- No!
- Silence!

01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:00.778
- Sam!
- Continue, children.

01:15:00.878 --> 01:15:03.806
Jim, no! No!

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.637
We don't have to do this!

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:09.815
Return!

01:15:10.603 --> 01:15:14.845
Now, Mama, please.
Mama, please, please don't do this.

01:15:14.945 --> 01:15:17.112
Don't do this. There's nothing to death.

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:20.345
It's just a crossing over
to another plane.

01:15:20.445 --> 01:15:23.498
Please, Mama, please.

01:15:26.803 --> 01:15:29.362
We shall all rise up...

01:15:29.762 --> 01:15:35.153
and we will rub the dust
of a thousand years from our eyes.

01:15:35.844 --> 01:15:37.873
Sarah, come on.

01:15:39.653 --> 01:15:42.220
Jim! She's getting away!

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:46.279
Sarah, run and hide! Run! Hide!

01:15:46.479 --> 01:15:49.417
- Jim!
- Those who will not follow

01:15:49.517 --> 01:15:51.237
shall be carried.

01:15:52.954 --> 01:15:56.904
Stop! Stop!

01:15:57.545 --> 01:15:59.340
No!

01:16:01.153 --> 01:16:03.470
This is my body.

01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:07.375
- This is my blood.
- No!

01:16:09.712 --> 01:16:10.970
Shh.

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:13.503
She is the flame of life,

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:16.340
the power of darkness.

01:16:17.728 --> 01:16:19.740
Let her go.

01:16:21.438 --> 01:16:23.385
Sarah!

01:16:23.487 --> 01:16:25.328
Sarah!

01:16:25.628 --> 01:16:27.437
Brothers...

01:16:28.337 --> 01:16:30.060
sisters.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.473
<i>...and fear not
them which kill the body...</i>

01:16:36.112 --> 01:16:39.345
<i>...shocked to realize...</i>

01:16:39.545 --> 01:16:44.257
Supreme desire, supreme deity.

01:16:47.128 --> 01:16:49.623
Supreme change.

01:16:57.295 --> 01:17:00.456
There is no joy without suffering.

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.501
Be ready with the antidote, Sam.

01:17:23.628 --> 01:17:27.645
Sam, the children, the children.
Please. The antidote. Do it now.

01:17:27.745 --> 01:17:30.637
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:17:30.737 --> 01:17:34.050
- Stay away from the children!
- I'm not killing her!

01:17:42.578 --> 01:17:46.598
No! No, Sam! The children!

01:17:47.028 --> 01:17:50.865
Sam! No, Sam, please!

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.600
Please.

01:18:02.362 --> 01:18:05.087
Get away from the children!
Put your hands behind your head!

01:18:05.187 --> 01:18:08.363
You'll rise. You'll rise again.

01:18:08.463 --> 01:18:10.056
Please. Rise...

01:18:10.195 --> 01:18:13.308
Get up and put your hands
behind your head, now!

01:18:13.795 --> 01:18:16.148
Your hands where we can see 'em!

01:18:18.495 --> 01:18:23.237
- What have you done?
- What have you done, sir?

01:18:23.337 --> 01:18:27.945
You think you bar the way?
You only inflame my wrath!

01:18:28.345 --> 01:18:34.171
Your children! Your children's
children will be subsumed!

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.970
You all will be subsumed!

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:39.653
No one will escape my wrath!

01:18:42.497 --> 01:18:44.768
You all!

01:19:23.545 --> 01:19:26.073
The FBI agent...

01:19:27.653 --> 01:19:29.931
that was my dad.

01:19:32.087 --> 01:19:35.895
- He was the one that...
- Who let all those people die.

01:19:36.495 --> 01:19:38.781
All of them.

01:19:39.362 --> 01:19:41.415
I mean...

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:46.953
- None of them...
- No. They wouldn't have.

01:19:47.053 --> 01:19:50.581
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:20:34.087 --> 01:20:36.490
I wanna be with you.

01:20:44.962 --> 01:20:47.848
Wait for me.

01:21:02.937 --> 01:21:05.678
They've been here, waiting...

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.228
for me to come back.

01:21:08.628 --> 01:21:11.112
They need you, all of you.

01:21:11.412 --> 01:21:15.370
- They have to.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.565
New vessels...

01:21:18.003 --> 01:21:20.728
to continue on in...

01:21:21.378 --> 01:21:23.048
in eternity.

01:21:24.237 --> 01:21:26.703
Maggie, like Jim said...

01:21:26.803 --> 01:21:30.072
There is no joy without suffering.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.787
Brother, sister...

01:21:35.887 --> 01:21:40.962
the sins of the father
now laid upon the children.

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:43.345
I don't know what's happening here,

01:21:43.445 --> 01:21:45.879
but we're gonna get out of here.
Let's go, Christian.

01:21:46.029 --> 01:21:49.828
Christian's gone, Maggie.
It's time for you to join us.

01:21:49.928 --> 01:21:53.020
- Christian?
- It's amazing, Maggie.

01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:55.373
You'll see.

01:21:55.837 --> 01:21:57.853
After all...

01:21:58.253 --> 01:22:01.715
who wouldn't want everlasting life?

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.423
Get the fuck off me!

01:22:33.362 --> 01:22:36.715
No! Please, no!

01:22:37.045 --> 01:22:39.453
It wasn't his fault!

01:22:39.753 --> 01:22:41.903
He didn't know!

01:22:42.003 --> 01:22:44.156
I didn't know.

01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:51.828
Why is this happening?

01:22:52.428 --> 01:22:54.240
Why?

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:11.403
Release the body...

01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:15.640
that pins the spirit...

01:24:16.378 --> 01:24:20.353
that frees the soul from its mortal coil.

01:24:22.495 --> 01:24:25.004
My will be done.

01:25:06.955 --> 01:25:08.862
Ed?

01:25:08.962 --> 01:25:11.431
Jill? Maggie!

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.903
Don't worry.

01:25:19.403 --> 01:25:23.340
They're not dead.
He's gonna bring them back.

01:25:27.887 --> 01:25:30.695
No. No.

01:25:30.795 --> 01:25:33.320
You okay? Mr. Williams, you all right?

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.981
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:49.995 --> 01:25:55.449
The veil has been lifted,
and the fallen shall rise.

01:26:07.678 --> 01:26:11.362
Children of the void, sons of chaos,

01:26:11.462 --> 01:26:13.728
it is the last hour.

01:26:13.828 --> 01:26:16.578
The hebdomad is complete.

01:26:16.678 --> 01:26:21.270
We have been remade by Yaldabaoth

01:26:21.370 --> 01:26:23.970
in the image of the Seven Archons

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:28.670
who created and enslaved this world.

01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:31.178
We are the hidden masters.

01:26:31.278 --> 01:26:34.445
We are the architects of anarchy.

01:26:34.545 --> 01:26:40.303
We are the dark fucking soul eaters,

01:26:40.403 --> 01:26:43.112
lords of the unrighteous.

01:26:43.212 --> 01:26:48.945
Today our new reign begins
in a new reality!

01:26:49.045 --> 01:26:51.678
I told you! I told you!

01:26:51.778 --> 01:26:55.412
I told you we'd be deathless!

01:26:55.512 --> 01:27:00.303
We just, uh, need new shells
from time to time

01:27:00.403 --> 01:27:04.078
and plenty of souls to eat.

01:27:04.378 --> 01:27:07.768
Our legion will rise

01:27:07.868 --> 01:27:09.703
from behind the veil

01:27:09.803 --> 01:27:13.178
to reap the pain that we have wrought!

01:27:13.278 --> 01:27:17.012
The Seven shall become a vast multitude.

01:27:17.112 --> 01:27:20.928
These are the days of vengeance and wrath!

01:27:21.028 --> 01:27:26.081
The deathless eon has begun!

01:27:26.737 --> 01:27:29.706
It's a beautiful day.
