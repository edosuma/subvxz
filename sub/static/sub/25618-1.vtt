00:57.733 --> 00:59.667
- Foxtrot Six, come in.

01:00.767 --> 01:03.600
Foxtrot Six, do you read me?

01:03.600 --> 01:05.700
- I read you loud and clear.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.900
- What's your 20?

01:07.900 --> 01:10.200
- I'm four klicks northeast
of the drop off point.

01:16.067 --> 01:18.633
- Got you right in my
sights, Foxtrot Six.

01:18.633 --> 01:20.400
I'm 40 meters at
your five o'clock.

01:21.267 --> 01:22.333
- I don't see any convoy.

01:22.333 --> 01:23.367
Where the hell is it?

01:24.667 --> 01:27.067
- These are the
coordinates we were given.

01:27.067 --> 01:30.067
- Well it's not here,
we got bad intel.

01:30.067 --> 01:33.067
- I was told directly
by the boss man himself.

01:33.067 --> 01:35.133
- Wait a minute,
I see something.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.400
At my three o'clock, 200 meters.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.533
- There you are, fucker.

01:47.533 --> 01:49.067
I just made visual confirmation.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.700
You're right on
top of the target.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.300
- I see him.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.133
I'll take him.

01:53.133 --> 01:54.633
- Wait for backup.

01:54.633 --> 01:56.567
They don't show, we
abort the mission.

01:56.567 --> 01:58.900
I'm not dying over 100 grand.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.933
- Sorry, I gotta
pay off my Ferrari.

02:01.933 --> 02:02.767
- Hey wait!

02:05.900 --> 02:07.133
- Sniper!

02:08.067 --> 02:08.967
- You crazy--

02:41.467 --> 02:42.300
- What now?

02:44.400 --> 02:45.600
- Freeze, hands up!

02:45.600 --> 02:47.200
Hands behind your head!

02:47.200 --> 02:49.300
- Drop it,
don't be a hotshot.

02:50.133 --> 02:51.600
- Don't move!

02:51.600 --> 02:52.600
Don't fucking move!

02:53.633 --> 02:54.600
- Hold your fire.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.067
Who the fuck are you?

02:58.233 --> 02:59.167
Who hired you, huh?

03:01.267 --> 03:02.100
- Your mother.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.300
- My mother, huh?

03:08.133 --> 03:10.067
Take these motherfuckers.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.900
- Get your
ass up, move it!

03:29.900 --> 03:31.133
- This is it, lovebirds.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.067
Last stop.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.233
Don't fuck up in
your next lifetime.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.733
Send them to their maker.

04:21.533 --> 04:23.267
- Take cover, take cover!

04:39.733 --> 04:40.833
- Move, move!

04:43.300 --> 04:45.067
- Bazooka!

05:36.367 --> 05:38.067
- Keep
firing, keep firing!

06:29.500 --> 06:31.933
- Move, move, move!

09:40.600 --> 09:42.433
- Come get your bread.

09:50.233 --> 09:52.900
No thanks, no gratitude?

09:52.900 --> 09:54.333
- 'Til next time.

09:58.267 --> 10:00.067
- Thank you, Mother.

10:09.867 --> 10:10.833
- I know the one.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.933
- Yeah, we had a great time.

10:12.933 --> 10:14.133
- She always talks too much.

10:14.133 --> 10:16.367
- That's not nice!

10:16.367 --> 10:17.567
- I know, but it's true.

10:18.933 --> 10:21.100
- And then I came here
'cause I wanted to see you.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.700
- I love seeing you.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.667
I love the time
we have together.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.767
- Me too, so stop
watching the television.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.200
I think I can distract you.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.700
- And I like those lips.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.933
- Well then give 'em to me.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.700
- Business in our own backyard?

11:12.700 --> 11:13.767
I don't know, Jack.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.067
And I don't hit
civilians, you know that.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.100
- Hey Jack.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.333
- Hey Theresa.

11:20.333 --> 11:21.900
- I'll see you next Thursday.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.800
- Okay, Babe, I
look forward to it.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.633
- Okay, Baby.

11:30.767 --> 11:33.700
- This man is no civilian,
not by your definition.

11:36.867 --> 11:38.433
- What's the other job?

11:38.433 --> 11:39.767
- Same people.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.867
They just want us
to make an exchange.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.600
They pay us half
after the first job,

11:43.600 --> 11:45.267
half after the second.

11:45.267 --> 11:46.867
- Does Dasha trust these people?

11:47.767 --> 11:49.067
- We know they have money.

11:49.900 --> 11:50.700
- How much?

11:51.900 --> 11:52.733
- 300,000.

11:55.267 --> 11:56.167
- 300K?

11:57.700 --> 11:58.533
For one man?

12:01.067 --> 12:02.333
He must be very important.

12:03.467 --> 12:06.200
How many people is gonna
take to do this job?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.600
- He's an easy mark.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.533
Man lives by himself,
he has no protection.

12:10.533 --> 12:11.433
- Wife, children?

12:12.467 --> 12:13.500
- He'll be all alone.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.200
- Hmm.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.900
Have you talked to
Dasha and Dara about it?

12:18.900 --> 12:19.967
- Not yet.

12:19.967 --> 12:21.067
- You need to do that.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.367
- I'll make the call.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.167
I checked it out already.

12:29.167 --> 12:32.433
The house isn't under his
name, it's under the city's.

12:32.433 --> 12:35.300
It's confiscated property,
probably seized by the police.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.900
- Hmm.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.133
Where's his real residence?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.100
- He hasn't been living
in his own residence

12:40.100 --> 12:40.933
for four months.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.400
- Means they're hiding him out.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.400
They know there's a
contract out on him.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.600
- What do you think, too risky?

12:51.700 --> 12:52.900
- No, we're gonna do it.

13:00.867 --> 13:01.700
Is that him?

13:04.300 --> 13:05.900
- Yeah, that's him, let's go.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.100
- No, no, let him get inside.

13:09.167 --> 13:10.200
I want it to be quiet.

13:26.233 --> 13:27.633
- Let's rock and roll, guys.

13:40.067 --> 13:40.900
- Okay.

13:41.767 --> 13:42.600
What do you think?

13:42.600 --> 13:43.433
Yeah, I'll be there!

13:45.900 --> 13:47.567
I'll, alright!

14:14.100 --> 14:16.967
Come get me mother fuckers!

14:30.533 --> 14:31.367
- Let's roll.

14:50.633 --> 14:53.433
- Mr. Dippolito, do you have
any comment on the verdict?

14:54.467 --> 14:55.867
- Today's a great day.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.467
Justice has finally been served.

14:58.433 --> 14:59.800
- Mr. Dippolito,
can you please--

14:59.800 --> 15:01.367
- You can address me.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.800
My client would
like me to be his

15:02.800 --> 15:05.100
spokesperson for the time being.

15:05.100 --> 15:08.633
- Is it true that the judge
declared a mistrial in the case?

15:08.633 --> 15:10.067
- Yes, it's true.

15:10.067 --> 15:12.200
My client has been
cleared of all charges,

15:12.200 --> 15:14.700
just like we knew he would be.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.500
- Because of the death of the
prime witness against him?

15:18.967 --> 15:22.067
- We are truly saddened of
the death of Mr. Manzella.

15:23.167 --> 15:25.533
He was a dear
friend of my client.

15:25.533 --> 15:29.200
But his testimony would be
totally irrelevant in this case.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.833
- Leo Manzella was
murdered, was he not?

15:31.833 --> 15:33.800
- That investigation
is still pending

15:33.800 --> 15:37.400
and has absolutely nothing to
do with this case whatsoever.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.133
- But your client benefited
from his death, did he not?

15:42.133 --> 15:44.733
- We have no further
comments at this time.

15:44.733 --> 15:47.400
My client would like to
go back to his quiet life.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.400
We ask that the press and media

15:49.400 --> 15:51.700
please respect his
right for privacy.

15:55.733 --> 15:57.800
- That was a great
performance back there, Rusty.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.367
I am impressed.

16:01.567 --> 16:04.067
We know you're the one
that had him clipped.

16:04.067 --> 16:06.167
- Excuse
me, this is harassment.

16:06.167 --> 16:07.733
Please leave now!

16:07.733 --> 16:09.100
- How did you know?

16:09.100 --> 16:11.100
I mean, I didn't even
know where he was.

16:12.067 --> 16:12.833
Who told you?

16:14.100 --> 16:16.300
Who do you know on the inside?

16:18.133 --> 16:19.600
- That's
it, I'm going straight

16:19.600 --> 16:21.067
to your superiors.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.067
We're filing a harassment
suit against you.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.800
- Don't worry, Rusty.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
I'll nail you next time.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.533
- Have a nice day, Detective.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.533
- Detective Driscoll,
how did you find out--

16:42.533 --> 16:44.267
- Get out of my face!

16:44.267 --> 16:45.100
Bitch.

16:46.433 --> 16:48.067
- Did you get that?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.333
- That was Detective
Carol Driscoll,

17:24.333 --> 17:26.532
who led the investigation
into the murder case

17:26.532 --> 17:30.133
against alleged rackets boss
Russell "Rusty" Dippolito,

17:30.133 --> 17:33.067
who has been released
after a mistrial.

17:33.067 --> 17:37.367
- Rita, was it because of
the death of Leo Manzella?

17:51.933 --> 17:54.867
- Yes, as you know, Leo
Manzella, whose testimony

17:54.867 --> 17:57.367
was crucial in the
conviction of Dippolito,

17:57.367 --> 17:58.500
was murdered while--

17:58.500 --> 18:00.067
- Russell Dipplolito.

18:00.067 --> 18:01.667
- He was under the protection
of local law enforcement.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.067
Why wasn't he--

18:03.067 --> 18:04.600
- This is not good.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.500
- Now what the
hell is the holdup?

18:31.500 --> 18:33.333
- They're stealing from us.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.133
They don't wanna
pay the full amount.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.500
- No problem, guys.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.633
My boss will have
the rest of the money

18:42.633 --> 18:44.733
after you do this other
job on our behalf.

18:45.867 --> 18:47.767
- Listen, the deal was half now

18:47.767 --> 18:50.167
and half after the second job.

18:50.167 --> 18:52.700
Tell your boss we're not
people that you want to stiff,

18:52.700 --> 18:54.400
I can guarantee you that.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.800
Now, where's the 150
grand you owe us?

19:00.067 --> 19:03.833
- When Mr. Kryukov gives
orders, he doesn't ask twice.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.233
- Well neither do I.

19:05.233 --> 19:06.100
- Take the money.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.100
We'll give you the
rest after the job.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.267
All you have to do is
make an exchange for us.

19:13.267 --> 19:15.600
- What kind of exchange
is this anyway?

19:15.600 --> 19:18.633
Why can't your people do it?

19:18.633 --> 19:20.100
- Easy job.

19:20.100 --> 19:23.200
We give you package, you
give package to the people.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.567
They will give you money, and
you bring money back to us.

19:26.567 --> 19:27.433
Easy.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.633
- What's in the package?

19:30.433 --> 19:32.667
I'm gonna ask you once
more, what's in the package?

19:32.667 --> 19:33.533
Smack, coke?

19:36.467 --> 19:37.567
That's what I thought.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.167
We make the exchange and
the risk falls on us.

19:43.633 --> 19:45.600
- We'll give you
the details later.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.533
Expect a call tonight.

19:47.533 --> 19:49.067
Have a good one.

19:53.900 --> 19:54.800
- Hey, Khrushchev.

19:55.967 --> 19:58.233
Don't let your mouth
overload your ass.

19:58.233 --> 20:00.567
Your pathetic threats
mean nothing to us.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.600
- I don't know about this.

20:20.767 --> 20:22.633
I don't wanna get caught
up in some dope deal.

20:22.633 --> 20:24.533
It's too risky.

20:24.533 --> 20:26.033
- That's why they sent us out.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.600
In case there's a bust,
they walk away clean

20:30.700 --> 20:32.200
while we go to prison.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.100
- Kryukov's people
are not gonna pay us.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.667
You know they're gonna smoke
us after we do this for them.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.200
- I say we take what
we have and we move on.

20:42.900 --> 20:46.567
- These maggots have no
idea who they've crossed.

20:46.567 --> 20:50.467
- Look, I know what
you're thinking, alright.

20:50.467 --> 20:52.367
We go head to head
with these people,

20:52.367 --> 20:54.567
we're looking for
some big problems.

20:54.567 --> 20:56.333
Maybe we cut our losses.

20:56.333 --> 20:59.900
- No, nobody steals
from us, nobody.

20:59.900 --> 21:04.100
I don't care who they
are, one way or another

21:04.100 --> 21:06.733
we're gonna get the
money that they owe us.

21:06.733 --> 21:07.900
Are we agreed?

21:10.067 --> 21:10.867
- Agreed.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.167
- Yeah.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.233
- I have a bad
feeling about this.

22:54.767 --> 22:55.800
- So what's the word?

22:56.733 --> 22:58.233
- They're flyin' in next week.

22:59.733 --> 23:00.600
- Shit!

23:02.367 --> 23:03.733
What the fuck do they want?

23:06.067 --> 23:09.433
That's all I need is for them
to be breathing down my back.

23:09.433 --> 23:10.867
- They wanna sit down.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.800
Manzella was one of Broncato's
people in St. Louis.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.667
After what happened, happened,

23:16.667 --> 23:18.933
Broncato went
runnin' to Chicago.

23:18.933 --> 23:20.567
- Broncato is a chicken shit!

23:22.200 --> 23:25.467
Goes running to Scozzari
like some little sissy

23:25.467 --> 23:28.300
instead of settling
things like a man.

23:28.300 --> 23:31.067
- We're supposed to get
permission from Chicago

23:31.067 --> 23:33.133
before we clip anyone
from another family.

23:34.467 --> 23:35.300
- Permission?

23:39.400 --> 23:40.700
Manzella was a rat!

23:42.733 --> 23:45.667
Besides, this is
my own backyard.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.100
Who the fuck do
they think they are

23:47.100 --> 23:49.267
coming over here and
telling us what to do?

23:49.267 --> 23:51.067
You don't see me
going to Chicago

23:51.067 --> 23:53.300
and telling Scozzari
how to run his business.

23:55.567 --> 23:58.333
- Well listen, all
the Midwest families,

23:59.567 --> 24:02.833
Chicago, Cleveland,
Milwaukee, Detroit,

24:02.833 --> 24:05.400
Kansas City, Broncato
from St. Louis,

24:06.500 --> 24:07.800
they're all gonna be here.

24:09.933 --> 24:12.767
Look Boss, we gotta
problem we gotta solve.

24:13.833 --> 24:15.500
Let's solve it
before it's a problem

24:15.500 --> 24:17.100
that's gonna bite us in the ass.

24:21.933 --> 24:23.833
- No, absolutely not.

24:25.267 --> 24:27.067
I'm not going to the DA or
Judge Patterson about this.

24:27.067 --> 24:28.567
Wiretaps are out
of the question.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.100
- Chief, this is the
only chance we have.

24:31.967 --> 24:33.633
Look, I don't know about you,

24:33.633 --> 24:36.700
but I know he had
Manzella whacked,

24:36.700 --> 24:40.067
and Paulie Amandre,
and Tommy Shartino.

24:40.067 --> 24:43.167
Every potential witness
we had against him!

24:48.467 --> 24:51.067
These guys were
under our protection.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.367
Our protection.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.733
In undisclosed locations.

24:55.733 --> 24:58.200
How did they Dippolito find him?

24:58.200 --> 24:59.667
- Enough of this shit, Carol.

25:02.067 --> 25:03.233
- You know what I think?

25:06.367 --> 25:09.300
I think there are leaks
right here in the department.

25:12.067 --> 25:17.067
Someone or, I don't know, some
people here are on the take.

25:17.833 --> 25:18.667
- It's over.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.600
Leave the man be.

25:21.467 --> 25:22.700
He's a harmless old has been,

25:22.700 --> 25:23.933
he's gonna croak in a few years.

25:23.933 --> 25:25.200
We've got bigger fish to fry.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.333
- Oh, that is bullshit!

25:27.733 --> 25:30.367
He's smarter than you and he's
certainly smarter than me.

25:30.367 --> 25:32.333
How do you think he's
run things for so long?

25:33.733 --> 25:35.500
- I'm not wasting any more
of the department's resources

25:35.500 --> 25:39.067
investigating some
penny ante operator.

25:39.067 --> 25:40.067
- Penny ante?

25:41.467 --> 25:44.700
Nothing legal or illegal
goes on in this city

25:44.700 --> 25:48.700
without this guy pulling the
strings, and you know it.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.800
- Dippolito's attorney
just contacted me.

25:51.900 --> 25:52.733
- Oh shit.

25:54.133 --> 25:55.633
- This is the third
harassment complaint

25:55.633 --> 25:58.333
they filed against not only
you, but the whole department.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.067
- Are you gonna let this
weasel intimidate you?

26:02.067 --> 26:05.100
- I'm getting shit from
upstairs over this.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.467
I mean it, move on!

26:09.067 --> 26:09.833
- He's clever.

26:11.067 --> 26:11.967
Boy, is he clever.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.267
But he slips, he always slips.

26:19.733 --> 26:22.900
And I am gonna catch
him when he does.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.600
- Where's Kryukov?

27:22.800 --> 27:25.933
- Relax, he sent me
to broker the deal.

27:25.933 --> 27:27.600
- Dippolito said we're supposed

27:27.600 --> 27:29.300
to meet with Kryukov's people.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.100
- We represent Kryukov.

27:31.100 --> 27:31.933
- Bullshit.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.500
We talk to Kryukov
directly or no deal.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.133
- Oh cut the crap.

27:39.133 --> 27:40.767
You wanna make the deal or not?

27:40.767 --> 27:42.100
I got the goods right here.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.100
But you gotta show me the money.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.900
- I call Russell Dippolito first

27:48.900 --> 27:51.300
to find out what the
hell is going on here!

27:51.300 --> 27:52.867
- Then do it!

27:58.767 --> 27:59.600
- Yes.

28:02.067 --> 28:04.167
- Hey, Dippolito,
what's going on here?

28:05.433 --> 28:06.267
Huh?

28:07.533 --> 28:09.667
Okay, okay?

28:12.600 --> 28:13.467
Hey, not yet.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.533
My man's going to
test the merchandise.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.433
- Be my guest.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.500
- Now that's what
I'm talkin' about.

29:05.067 --> 29:06.467
- Hey, what took you so long?

29:09.733 --> 29:11.233
- Hey Billy.

29:11.233 --> 29:12.067
- What?

29:12.067 --> 29:12.900
- Guess what I just did?

29:15.600 --> 29:17.433
I just got off the phone
with the DA's office

29:17.433 --> 29:20.833
about possible approval
for a wiretap on Dippolito.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.800
- You're going
over Darcy's head?

29:24.800 --> 29:25.633
- Mmhmm.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.100
- I think that's a bad idea.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.900
You know he's gonna
find out about this.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.167
- Yeah, I know. whatever.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.833
Anyhow, the judge
hasn't approved yet.

29:34.833 --> 29:39.533
So I'm just hoping that
Johnson at the DA's office

29:39.533 --> 29:43.067
gets back to me first
before he goes to Darcy,

29:43.067 --> 29:45.633
or they're gonna be using
me as target practice.

29:45.633 --> 29:46.600
- Driscoll.

29:47.867 --> 29:48.867
- Yeah, hey!

29:49.733 --> 29:53.067
How ya doin'?

29:53.067 --> 29:54.633
What's up?

29:54.633 --> 29:58.967
- I have a case I was
wishin' you'd help me with.

29:58.967 --> 29:59.800
- What is it?

30:01.100 --> 30:05.700
- I have three dead
Japanese nationals.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.433
They were murdered at the
Overland Hotel in Downtown.

30:09.900 --> 30:10.700
- Murdered?

30:11.967 --> 30:13.567
So, what are you tellin' me for?

30:14.700 --> 30:16.033
You know I can't help you.

30:17.567 --> 30:20.000
Take those ballet
slippers and go pirouette

30:20.000 --> 30:20.900
down to homicide.

30:22.133 --> 30:24.867
- Well, I would except
I just got off the phone

30:24.867 --> 30:27.367
with the Bureau and it
seems that these three

30:27.367 --> 30:32.367
Japanese nationals have
extensive criminal records

30:33.300 --> 30:34.800
and they're also
highly connected

30:34.800 --> 30:37.667
in the drug trafficking in
their home country of Japan.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.033
- You know nothing
goes on down here

30:41.033 --> 30:43.233
without Dippolito taking
part in the action.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.367
Might strengthen your
case for a wiretap

30:47.300 --> 30:50.367
if we can tie it to him.

31:05.467 --> 31:08.067
- Ain't none of us
going back home now.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.067
I hope it was worth it.

31:10.067 --> 31:11.733
- Jack, it'll be okay.

31:11.733 --> 31:16.733
We have 2.5 million in
cash and another 12 kilos

31:17.600 --> 31:20.067
of pure China white smack.

31:20.067 --> 31:24.500
Now on the street, that's
another 2.5 million.

31:26.367 --> 31:28.067
We're gonna make it okay.

31:28.067 --> 31:29.533
- Yeah, but that's only
if we live long enough

31:29.533 --> 31:31.633
to enjoy the fruits
of our labor.

31:31.633 --> 31:33.733
- We gotta leave town
as soon as possible.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.700
- Okay, well what
about the smack?

31:37.900 --> 31:39.300
We can't just dump it on eBay.

31:40.467 --> 31:41.867
- I have a contact
we can talk to.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.200
- This is big, let's
do it right away.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.500
We gotta move that stuff fast.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.933
You know Dippolito's gangsters

31:47.933 --> 31:50.133
are looking for us everywhere.

31:50.133 --> 31:52.733
- Yeah, but he's
not gonna find us.

31:52.733 --> 31:56.067
- That's right, we
gotta stick together.

34:09.766 --> 34:10.600
- Hello.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.367
- Well hello yourself.

34:13.367 --> 34:15.500
- We've been expecting you guys.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.067
Come on, follow me.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.600
Come on, this way.

34:24.132 --> 34:25.967
- Pick up the tickets,
drop 'em off at the club.

34:25.967 --> 34:27.699
I'll be here all day.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.367
Yeah, I gotta go.

34:29.367 --> 34:30.199
Bye.

34:31.900 --> 34:32.733
- Hi.

34:32.733 --> 34:35.367
- Hey Baby.

34:35.367 --> 34:38.533
Dasha, Baby,
Sweetheart, how are ya?

34:38.533 --> 34:39.766
You look good.

34:39.766 --> 34:40.766
I knew you couldn't
stay away from me.

34:40.766 --> 34:42.400
- In your dreams!

34:42.400 --> 34:44.067
- In my dreams?

34:44.067 --> 34:45.199
What about the night in Kabul?

34:45.199 --> 34:46.800
- We want to talk business.

34:50.533 --> 34:52.533
- Okay, everybody have a seat.

34:52.533 --> 34:53.367
I'm Andy.

34:54.600 --> 34:55.833
- Can I get you guys
something to drink

34:55.833 --> 34:57.132
before we get started?

34:57.132 --> 34:58.200
- No thank you, dear.

34:59.467 --> 35:01.533
Andy, no disrespect to you,

35:02.567 --> 35:04.233
but we're really
pressed for time

35:05.367 --> 35:07.167
and I'd appreciate
it if we could really

35:07.167 --> 35:09.133
get a move on quick as possible.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.267
- Okay, whaddya got for me?

35:22.067 --> 35:23.167
- You know what this is?

35:23.167 --> 35:24.067
Pure H.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.133
- Whaddya out of
your fucking mind?

35:27.133 --> 35:28.833
What are you bringin' this
shit into my club for?

35:28.833 --> 35:29.900
What's wrong with you?

35:29.900 --> 35:30.967
What are these guys, cops?

35:30.967 --> 35:32.233
You guys are cops?

35:32.233 --> 35:33.600
You know, by law, if
I ask you for badges

35:33.600 --> 35:34.900
you gotta tell me you're cops.
- They're not cops.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.567
They're not cops, you idiot.

35:36.567 --> 35:37.867
We want to make an exchange.

35:37.867 --> 35:40.300
- This is like fucking
entrapment here.

35:40.300 --> 35:41.767
- Andy, Andy!

35:41.767 --> 35:45.667
Look at me, do I look like
a freaking cop to you?

35:45.667 --> 35:47.867
I'm not a cop, I just
wanna move this deal

35:47.867 --> 35:49.133
as soon as possible.

35:49.133 --> 35:50.133
It'll make you rich.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.900
- Andy, can I speak with
you privately, please?

35:56.067 --> 35:57.267
Excuse us.

35:57.267 --> 35:58.200
- You're out of
your fucking mind

35:58.200 --> 35:59.433
bringing this shit in my club.

36:00.800 --> 36:01.633
Excuse me.

36:07.267 --> 36:08.500
What?

36:08.500 --> 36:09.567
- I think we should hear
what they have to say.

36:11.067 --> 36:14.267
- What you are you fucking
taking crazy pills, too?

36:14.267 --> 36:15.500
What's wrong with you?

36:15.500 --> 36:16.700
You want that shit
in our fucking club?

36:16.700 --> 36:17.633
- Look, no!

36:17.633 --> 36:19.167
I'm not crazy about this either,

36:19.167 --> 36:21.600
but this is the exact kinda
deal we're been looking for.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.733
Just think about it.

36:22.733 --> 36:24.167
- You're nuts.

36:24.167 --> 36:26.367
You know all the bullshit that's
gonna come down with this?

36:27.333 --> 36:29.700
- Look, tell 'em 30%.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.500
- I can't believe you
brought this shit in my club.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.400
I really can't.

36:51.100 --> 36:56.100
Hypothetically, if I was
interested in this briefcase,

37:04.433 --> 37:05.500
what would be my cut?

37:11.167 --> 37:13.833
- Vladimir, we've
got a problem here,

37:15.367 --> 37:17.067
and this your responsibility.

37:17.067 --> 37:18.267
- I know, you're right.

37:19.733 --> 37:21.800
We're here to set things right.

37:23.767 --> 37:26.567
- You came to me, you
wanted in on the action.

37:26.567 --> 37:31.567
So I introduced
you to my friends.

37:31.567 --> 37:34.100
This is how you repay me?

37:34.100 --> 37:35.700
You make me look like a jackass?

37:37.333 --> 37:40.467
- These were not my people.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.133
- Jesus Christ,
this is good stuff.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.867
- Why did you use outsiders?

37:55.100 --> 37:57.233
Do we have a trust issue here?

37:57.233 --> 37:58.067
- No, no, no.

37:59.433 --> 38:02.700
- Well, these clowns, they
killed three of Mr. Nagai's men.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.767
How are we gonna
compensate him for that?

38:11.433 --> 38:12.267
- Just money.

38:25.600 --> 38:30.367
This is the same amount that
they stole from Mr. Nagai.

38:32.500 --> 38:36.933
We do what we have to do to
keep our business together.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.400
- And the merchandise?

38:41.833 --> 38:46.433
- They stole it from me,
so I'm in charge of that.

38:56.633 --> 39:00.900
- Hey, you got
Dippolito, the Russians,

39:00.900 --> 39:04.267
and the Yakuza all
workin' together.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.833
- You got the judge to
sign off on this, right?

39:09.833 --> 39:12.900
- Um, no, not exactly, why?

39:14.867 --> 39:17.467
- What do you mean, not exactly?

39:17.467 --> 39:20.133
- You know, come on he
was taking too long.

39:20.133 --> 39:20.967
- Ah shit!

39:22.433 --> 39:23.900
You were supposed to
wait for Judge Patterson

39:23.900 --> 39:25.300
to sign off on the wiretaps.

39:26.933 --> 39:28.833
They're gonna have
my badge, Driscoll.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.067
If Darcy finds out
I wired this place,

39:32.067 --> 39:33.767
we're both up the creek.

39:33.767 --> 39:35.467
- Don't worry, okay?

39:35.467 --> 39:36.467
You're in the clear.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.067
Trust me, officially
you were never here.

39:40.067 --> 39:42.067
I don't see you anywhere.

39:42.067 --> 39:43.800
Your name's never gonna come up.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.200
And if anybody
asks any questions,

39:46.200 --> 39:49.067
I am fully responsible
and acted alone.

40:10.667 --> 40:11.633
- This is bullshit.

40:13.100 --> 40:16.033
The guys that were killed were
men of importance back home.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.200
We can't trust you anymore.

40:21.833 --> 40:24.067
- What else can I do
to solve the problem?

40:28.267 --> 40:30.333
- We all know how this
has to be handled.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.133
- You know what you gotta do.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.700
If you want our business
to continue, Vladimir,

40:38.833 --> 40:40.733
you take care of
those pieces of shit.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.800
- You're crazy!

40:44.800 --> 40:45.700
Is this worth it?

40:47.233 --> 40:49.633
Why put your job on
the line for this guy?

40:49.633 --> 40:53.333
- Because Russell Dippolito
had Detective Ronald Trumonti

40:53.333 --> 40:54.333
whacked, that's why.

40:55.300 --> 40:56.800
- Oh yeah, I heard about that.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.300
It was about nine years ago?

41:00.300 --> 41:01.600
- 10 and a half.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.300
- Before I
transferred here?

41:03.300 --> 41:04.133
- Yep.

41:05.567 --> 41:08.133
- It was a hung jury on
that case, if I remember.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.733
- Ronnie wasn't just my partner,

41:11.400 --> 41:15.067
he was my life, he
was my everything.

41:16.533 --> 41:17.767
He loved my father very much,

41:17.767 --> 41:20.067
he spent all his time
with him when he could.

41:20.067 --> 41:21.167
They both loved opera.

41:23.333 --> 41:25.100
My dad got sick, had
a cardiac arrest,

41:25.100 --> 41:29.400
Ronnie was right
there at the hospital.

41:30.667 --> 41:32.267
You see this locket that I wear?

41:35.133 --> 41:36.367
These are Ronnie's ashes.

41:38.500 --> 41:39.500
I never take it off.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.133
- Jesus.

41:46.267 --> 41:47.800
I'm sorry.

41:47.800 --> 41:50.433
- Did you know that the jury
was bought in that case?

41:52.767 --> 41:54.767
Dippolito walked away scot-free.

41:56.833 --> 41:57.733
Just waltzed away.

41:59.800 --> 42:02.467
That's why one way or another

42:05.067 --> 42:09.467
I am going to nail
that son of a bitch.

42:17.067 --> 42:17.933
- , welcome.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.533
I'd like to thank
everybody for comin'.

42:22.933 --> 42:24.967
Now some of you know each
other and some of yous don't.

42:24.967 --> 42:27.167
So I'm gonna
introduce everybody.

42:27.167 --> 42:30.333
This is Julie Matranga
from Cleveland.

42:32.067 --> 42:34.267
Nick Adrizzone from Kansas City.

42:34.267 --> 42:35.800
- Gentlemen.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.700
- My friend from
Detroit, Jack Abate.

42:40.067 --> 42:41.533
Carl Disimone from Milwaukee.

42:44.700 --> 42:46.800
And from St. Louis,
Ralph Broncato.

42:48.600 --> 42:52.200
I think everybody's familiar
with Russell Dippolito

42:52.200 --> 42:54.200
and Frank Giordano
from the L.A. Family.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.933
Now we all know why we're here.

43:00.267 --> 43:03.133
So does anybody wanna
open up the meeting?

43:07.733 --> 43:08.567
Anyone?

43:12.300 --> 43:16.100
- Leo Manzella, he was with me.

43:17.267 --> 43:19.500
You hit one of my guys
without permission.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.100
That's like a slap in the face.

43:23.500 --> 43:24.467
- Fuck Manzella.

43:25.700 --> 43:27.400
Your boy was gonna rat on me.

43:29.067 --> 43:31.333
I got a right to protect myself.

43:31.333 --> 43:33.533
And what the fuck was he
doing out here anyway?

43:33.533 --> 43:35.300
- The point is,
none of our people

43:35.300 --> 43:37.933
are supposed to be clipped
without all of us agreeing.

43:37.933 --> 43:40.200
- Ah, don't give me
that shit, Julie.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.933
You wanna talk about
the rules, let's talk.

43:42.933 --> 43:45.567
- Broncato had his
people out here

43:45.567 --> 43:48.767
running around in my backyard
without my permission.

43:49.733 --> 43:51.500
Just like all the rest of you.

43:51.500 --> 43:55.067
- Rusty, this was the
arrangement we had with Fuenzi.

43:55.067 --> 43:56.867
- Fuenzi's gone.

43:56.867 --> 43:58.067
I'm the boss now.

43:59.467 --> 44:01.867
And I'm gonna start doing
things by the book out here.

44:03.300 --> 44:05.900
All of you guys, you got
people runnin' around

44:05.900 --> 44:09.867
out here doing things behind
my back, like I'm half a fag.

44:11.567 --> 44:15.467
If my guys came to St.
Louis or to Chicago

44:15.467 --> 44:17.500
they'd be clipped
so fast that they

44:17.500 --> 44:18.833
wouldn't know what hit 'em.

44:20.267 --> 44:22.400
- Hey Rusty, you're outta
line talkin' like that.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.567
Show some appreciation here.

44:24.567 --> 44:26.100
You know, the only
reason your in office

44:26.100 --> 44:28.400
is because we put
you there, capisce?

44:29.600 --> 44:31.467
- You voted for me
because you thought

44:31.467 --> 44:33.733
I was gonna be in your pocket.

44:33.733 --> 44:36.233
Well, you were wrong.

44:36.233 --> 44:38.267
- Listen, you're under us.

44:38.267 --> 44:40.700
Everything from Pennsylvania
to the West Coast

44:40.700 --> 44:41.833
belongs to Chicago.

44:42.967 --> 44:45.067
You're out here working
for us, understood?

44:48.400 --> 44:50.267
- That's what I wanna
talk to you about.

44:52.233 --> 44:53.100
I'm the boss now.

44:54.233 --> 44:56.067
Things are gonna
change around here.

44:57.800 --> 45:00.400
I don't want Chicago
representing us no more.

45:01.533 --> 45:03.500
- What are you talkin'
about here, Rusty?

45:04.633 --> 45:07.767
- My boys, we can stand
on our own two feet.

45:09.467 --> 45:11.067
I want a seat on the commission.

45:12.300 --> 45:13.800
- Rusty, come on!

45:13.800 --> 45:15.100
That'll never happen.

45:15.100 --> 45:17.300
Never in a million years.

45:17.300 --> 45:20.500
- I say we take a vote
on it next time around.

45:22.133 --> 45:23.200
- Vote?

45:23.200 --> 45:24.300
What vote?

45:24.300 --> 45:25.733
There ain't gonna be no vote.

45:26.633 --> 45:28.500
You wanna piss on us?

45:28.500 --> 45:30.333
You wanna start a
war with all of us?

45:32.267 --> 45:36.333
- I got Rick Obono
in Pittsburgh, I got
the Tampa Family,

45:36.333 --> 45:38.833
and all five
families in New York.

45:38.833 --> 45:40.333
They're all behind me on this.

45:41.933 --> 45:45.533
You make a move against
me, you move against them.

45:46.933 --> 45:49.767
- You say you got the whole
East Coast, but where are they?

45:50.967 --> 45:52.600
They haven't even
sent an emissary.

45:54.300 --> 45:56.700
- Hey Rusty, don't
do this thing.

45:58.067 --> 45:59.700
It's not gonna be
good for nobody.

46:00.667 --> 46:02.233
It's not gonna be good for you,

46:02.233 --> 46:04.467
and it's not gonna
be good for us.

46:04.467 --> 46:06.700
Now we ain't like our
goombas out in New York

46:06.700 --> 46:09.233
that leave their
dead on the street.

46:09.233 --> 46:10.333
We make 'em disappear.

46:11.500 --> 46:13.600
Remember what happened
to Hoffa in Detroit?

46:15.667 --> 46:18.133
- I'm just sayin' what's
gonna happen eventually.

46:20.067 --> 46:23.500
But for now, I don't
want any of you

46:23.500 --> 46:27.067
comin' out here unless I say so.

46:28.400 --> 46:29.567
That's a crock of shit.

46:30.733 --> 46:33.533
If I catch any of your
boys on the street,

46:33.533 --> 46:36.233
I'm shippin' 'em back
to you in caskets.

46:39.433 --> 46:43.067
- Hey Rusty, one more thing.

46:44.767 --> 46:46.067
Pay attention.

46:46.067 --> 46:46.900
Watch your back.

46:59.067 --> 47:00.067
This stupid, fucking.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.133
Who the hell's he think he is?

47:19.700 --> 47:21.233
- What is it?

47:21.233 --> 47:23.233
- We got someone here that
might be able to help us.

47:32.800 --> 47:33.633
- Hello, Mr. D.

47:35.733 --> 47:40.067
I got some information that
I think you might wanna know.

47:43.900 --> 47:44.900
- We trust this guy?

47:46.067 --> 47:46.867
- No.

47:48.067 --> 47:51.067
But right now he's the
only connection we have.

47:51.067 --> 47:53.067
- If we can't trust
him why are we here?

47:53.067 --> 47:54.600
- Let's just see what happens.

48:00.133 --> 48:00.933
- Okay.

48:44.533 --> 48:46.500
- One of Kryukov's men.

48:52.367 --> 48:53.233
- Move away.

48:57.067 --> 48:57.867
Let's go.

49:18.867 --> 49:20.367
- Hello.

49:20.367 --> 49:21.500
- This must be Rusty.

49:24.267 --> 49:25.900
- Who's this?

49:25.900 --> 49:27.200
How'd you get this number?

49:28.633 --> 49:31.667
- I can find any
number, anything, anytime.

49:31.667 --> 49:34.667
Don't bother calling
your corrupt cops
down at the precinct.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.567
They won't be able
to trace this number.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.933
- Who the fuck is this?

49:42.300 --> 49:44.067
- I'm the one you
ordered a hit on.

49:45.300 --> 49:48.333
Yeah, that's right,
I'm still walkin'.

49:49.600 --> 49:51.267
Those Russian clowns you sent

49:51.267 --> 49:53.500
couldn't even tie
their own shoelaces.

49:53.500 --> 49:55.067
They're all dead.

49:55.067 --> 49:57.567
And you didn't have the
guts to come yourself

49:57.567 --> 49:59.200
or send your own people.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.500
You're goin' down, Rusty.

50:02.167 --> 50:04.100
- Listen you stupid
son of a bitch,

50:06.300 --> 50:07.667
do you know who I am?

50:09.167 --> 50:11.200
If you did, you
wouldn't be making

50:11.200 --> 50:12.500
this phone call right now.

50:14.100 --> 50:16.433
You should have left
town a long time ago.

50:17.900 --> 50:18.967
- I know who you are.

50:20.333 --> 50:21.567
You're nobody.

50:21.567 --> 50:24.167
A self-made man who
admires his maker.

50:26.033 --> 50:28.733
And news flash, I'm
not going anywhere.

50:30.133 --> 50:32.200
But I will meet you soon.

50:32.200 --> 50:35.067
You're not gonna know where,
you're not gonna know when,

50:35.067 --> 50:36.367
you're not gonna know how.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.067
You're a dead man.

51:05.367 --> 51:06.200
- Hold on.

51:07.267 --> 51:08.200
It's open, come in.

51:12.067 --> 51:13.067
Oh hi, James.

51:13.067 --> 51:14.100
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doin'?

51:15.233 --> 51:18.200
- You know, you really
should get to know

51:19.767 --> 51:22.200
Davis down there in the Bureau.

51:22.200 --> 51:23.067
- Yeah?

51:29.200 --> 51:31.433
I give up, who is it?

51:31.433 --> 51:32.933
- That is Jack Samson.

51:34.067 --> 51:37.733
He is a former
Marine, Recon outfit.

51:38.667 --> 51:40.633
Has a minor criminal record.

51:42.167 --> 51:43.067
- Minor?

51:44.267 --> 51:46.167
So why were the feds
tailin' him then?

51:47.333 --> 51:49.367
- Well the feds
weren't tailin' him.

51:49.367 --> 51:51.167
That picture was
taken of those two

51:51.167 --> 51:53.067
coming out of The Odessa Lounge.

51:54.167 --> 51:57.400
Now, we both know
that The Odessa Lounge

51:57.400 --> 52:00.300
is the unofficial
headquarters of Vladimir--

52:00.300 --> 52:01.300
- Kryukov's...

52:02.333 --> 52:03.167
- Outfit.

52:04.833 --> 52:05.667
- Shit.

52:07.133 --> 52:11.733
- The FBI still has
an investigation
pending on Mr. Kryukov.

52:13.267 --> 52:14.867
- You're not gonna believe this.

52:15.933 --> 52:17.800
I recorded a meeting.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.267
No, listen to me, listen to me.

52:19.267 --> 52:22.300
I recorded a meeting
he had with Dippolito.

52:22.300 --> 52:25.333
They talked about
whacking some outsiders

52:25.333 --> 52:29.667
for the killing of the
three Japanese victims

52:29.667 --> 52:31.833
in the Overland Hotel.

52:31.833 --> 52:33.067
- Look.
- This is him!

52:33.067 --> 52:34.800
- I didn't hear
that, okay, okay?

52:36.433 --> 52:37.900
- So, uh, who's the Playmate?

52:39.833 --> 52:42.833
- Our damsel is
Dasha Federovich.

52:42.833 --> 52:44.300
She's a Russian immigrant.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.100
The FBI did some digging on her.

52:47.100 --> 52:48.400
She's been in the
country three years.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.600
Oh, you're gonna love this.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.167
- I better.

52:52.167 --> 52:56.133
- She was a female member of
the Russian Special Forces.

52:58.300 --> 53:00.100
- Female Russian Forces?

53:01.900 --> 53:05.300
Oh Jesus Christ, I love that!

53:06.233 --> 53:07.600
A couple of cowboys!

53:08.733 --> 53:10.433
Oh shit, if they
go after Dippolito,

53:11.733 --> 53:14.400
anyone connected to him,
this town is gonna be

53:14.400 --> 53:18.200
one big shooting gallery.

53:20.333 --> 53:21.833
- Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

53:23.567 --> 53:24.500
- What?

53:24.500 --> 53:27.800
- And, uh, you never got any

53:27.800 --> 53:29.800
of this information
from me, right?

53:29.800 --> 53:30.800
I was not here.
- No, of course not.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.067
No, no, never.

53:32.067 --> 53:33.200
I never saw you,
you were never here.

53:33.200 --> 53:36.667
Hey, James, thank you.

53:38.400 --> 53:40.367
- I need you to leave town now.

53:40.367 --> 53:41.567
- What about you?

53:41.567 --> 53:43.600
- I never ran from
a fight before

53:43.600 --> 53:45.167
and I'm not gonna do it now.

53:45.167 --> 53:46.833
- Dippolito and the
Russians are not

53:46.833 --> 53:48.800
gonna go down easy either.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.633
- All hell's gonna
be breaking loose.

53:52.067 --> 53:53.067
- You don't think
we're gonna leave

53:53.067 --> 53:54.267
all the fun to you, do you?

53:55.400 --> 53:57.633
- Something's comin'
down, it's gonna be hot.

53:57.633 --> 53:59.167
- Okay.

53:59.167 --> 54:02.533
- Don't know exactly when,
but you guys gotta be ready.

54:02.533 --> 54:03.867
- Okay, don't worry
about it Boss.

54:03.867 --> 54:05.100
I'll handle it.

54:05.100 --> 54:06.733
I'll gather the troops,
get 'em ready for war.

56:05.867 --> 56:07.167
- gentlemen.

56:07.167 --> 56:09.167
Welcome, please come in.

56:22.433 --> 56:24.367
Please, right this way.

56:31.433 --> 56:33.533
- So that's
all you've got?

56:33.533 --> 56:35.333
- Well all three
of them work for

56:35.333 --> 56:36.633
an individual named Milan.

56:38.067 --> 56:40.633
Ex-Green Beret, first
served in Vietnam,

56:40.633 --> 56:44.300
then he fell off the
map for about 15 years.

56:44.300 --> 56:46.367
Now the rumor is
that he was recruited

56:46.367 --> 56:48.367
by the CIA Covert Ops.

56:49.767 --> 56:51.600
- Where can we find this guy?

56:51.600 --> 56:53.867
- Everything is
in that envelope.

57:06.200 --> 57:07.567
- I'll make some calls.

57:14.133 --> 57:15.567
- Let me stop you right there.

57:15.567 --> 57:17.233
, but Dom,

57:17.233 --> 57:18.700
we gotta get this prick out.

57:19.633 --> 57:21.167
I got business in California,

57:21.167 --> 57:23.400
especially Southern California.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.267
- What are you talkin' about?

57:25.267 --> 57:27.267
You talkin' about a
hit on another boss?

57:28.467 --> 57:30.300
You know what the
ramifications are?

57:30.300 --> 57:31.467
- Fuck the ramifications.

57:31.467 --> 57:33.833
- Whoa, Ralphy, where
do you get balls

57:33.833 --> 57:36.067
big enough talkin' like that?

57:36.067 --> 57:37.900
Look, your people
were in his territory,

57:37.900 --> 57:39.633
you were askin' for it.

57:39.633 --> 57:41.067
My people aren't goin' to war

57:41.067 --> 57:43.200
over business that
don't concern them.

57:44.800 --> 57:48.600
- Listen, Dom, you got
interests in California.

57:48.600 --> 57:50.300
It's your people
he's pushin' out.

57:51.267 --> 57:53.467
Now what has L.A. got right now?

57:53.467 --> 57:55.067
20, 30 people tops?

57:55.967 --> 57:56.800
Right?

57:56.800 --> 57:58.300
I say we move on them.

57:58.300 --> 58:00.733
Push these old dagos out.

58:00.733 --> 58:03.967
- Dominic, everybody,
we're businessmen here.

58:05.167 --> 58:06.500
As businessmen we have a right

58:06.500 --> 58:08.800
to a certain amount of privacy.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.567
But the minute a shot's fired,

58:10.567 --> 58:13.100
and it doesn't
matter who fires it,

58:13.100 --> 58:15.300
the public, the press, the cops,

58:15.300 --> 58:17.767
they'll be on us
like flies on shit.

58:17.767 --> 58:19.667
Like flies on shit.

58:19.667 --> 58:22.733
- And if we move in on Dippolito
we're breaking protocol.

58:23.933 --> 58:26.100
Our own people find out
we're breaking the rules

58:26.100 --> 58:27.533
then they'll turn against us.

58:29.500 --> 58:33.767
- Ralph, I know how you feel
about the hit on Manzella.

58:33.767 --> 58:35.233
- Thank you.

58:35.233 --> 58:38.200
- But Nick's right, we gotta
handle this thing right.

58:40.067 --> 58:42.067
This thing here's a
very delicate matter.

58:43.900 --> 58:45.167
Dippolito ain't shit,

58:46.467 --> 58:48.767
but he's got all the New
York people behind him.

58:50.833 --> 58:52.067
So we gotta be very careful

58:52.067 --> 58:53.700
not to step on the
wrong toes here.

58:55.500 --> 58:57.433
We ain't afraid of
the Five Families,

58:58.567 --> 59:00.467
but a war would be
very bad for business.

59:01.867 --> 59:05.067
So we don't bother them,
they don't bother us.

59:07.967 --> 59:11.500
- Okay, well,
what are we gonna do

59:11.500 --> 59:12.467
about this bastard?

59:15.800 --> 59:16.900
- Just leave it to me.

59:19.067 --> 59:20.333
I'll figure this thing out.

59:22.800 --> 59:23.633
- Alright.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.833
- This is a picture of him.

59:54.467 --> 59:55.300
- How much?

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.367
- Money's not the problem,

01:00:05.367 --> 01:00:07.467
just don't fail and
you'll get paid.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.700
- When do you need it done?

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.800
- As soon as possible.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.167
- You're partners with
Russell Dippolito, aren't you?

01:00:21.933 --> 01:00:23.133
Why don't you go to him?

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.800
You don't want him
to know, right?

01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:41.933
- Look, you don't
have to lie to me.

01:01:41.933 --> 01:01:43.167
- I'm not lying to you.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.933
I've never lied to you.

01:01:44.933 --> 01:01:48.167
Please understand this is for
your protection, not mine.

01:01:54.467 --> 01:01:55.900
It's dangerous for you.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.433
More danger than you even know.

01:01:58.733 --> 01:02:00.367
- Yeah, but I know
your way of life

01:02:00.367 --> 01:02:01.967
and it doesn't scare me.

01:02:01.967 --> 01:02:02.900
I'm a big girl.

01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:15.767
- But you gotta
trust me on this,

01:02:15.767 --> 01:02:17.367
you can't spend
time with me now.

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:18.767
We gotta get a time out.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.600
We always have to have it.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.600
- Let's go.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:52.800
- Theresa, Theresa!

01:02:59.467 --> 01:03:00.567
I'll get 'em.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.800
- Chief, can I
show you something?

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.633
- Yeah.

01:03:13.633 --> 01:03:14.900
- Okay, thank you.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:18.467
Now Dippolito was in a
meeting with this guy,

01:03:18.467 --> 01:03:20.300
Vladimir Kryukov.

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:26.733
Vladimir Kryukov, looks like

01:03:26.733 --> 01:03:28.367
a freaking eye
chart, doesn't it?

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.800
Good thing these guys
don't have middle names.

01:03:36.267 --> 01:03:38.300
Anyway, the feds have their
own investigations going on,

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.333
and this morning, the polizei,
the Republic of Georgia

01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:42.633
during the Soviet Era.

01:03:43.967 --> 01:03:47.633
And he has multiple indictments
for murder and extortion

01:03:47.633 --> 01:03:48.467
back in Moscow.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.667
This guy here, Boris
Bodrov, his right hand.

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:58.600
Now the feds believe, don't
quote me, but the feds believe

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.133
that they're part of an offshoot

01:04:00.133 --> 01:04:04.567
of a Russian crime
group based in Moscow.

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.067
- Very impressive.

01:04:08.067 --> 01:04:08.967
- Thank you.

01:04:08.967 --> 01:04:09.900
- You've done a lot of homework.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.700
- Yes I did, thank you.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.067
- Where'd you get
all the pictures?

01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:15.800
- Well, you know, I
did some surveillance

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.067
on Dippolito's club.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.100
- Off the books, I'm assuming.

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:21.933
- Of course.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.567
Look it, this here, Kazuo Nagai.

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:32.133
I got intel from
the feds on him too.

01:04:32.133 --> 01:04:35.133
Now remember those
three corpses we found

01:04:35.133 --> 01:04:36.600
in the Overland Hotel?

01:04:37.567 --> 01:04:38.867
- No.
- You remember.

01:04:38.867 --> 01:04:40.867
Well, it turns out
that every one of them

01:04:40.867 --> 01:04:45.533
had a record with the Osaka
Metropolitan Police in Japan.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.800
They're all members of
a criminal group called

01:04:52.067 --> 01:04:53.533
Nagai, guess what?

01:04:55.667 --> 01:04:57.300
Number three in
the organization.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.567
- What are these guys
all meeting about?

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:06.733
- Was something about
patching up a business deal

01:05:06.733 --> 01:05:09.100
because of some guy named Milan

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.133
who whacked those
guys in the hotel.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.300
- So, you were listening in?

01:05:15.733 --> 01:05:18.367
- Well, yeah, they were
talking about merchandise.

01:05:18.367 --> 01:05:21.067
Obviously this was some
dope deal gone real bad.

01:05:23.467 --> 01:05:24.667
- Wiretaps.

01:05:24.667 --> 01:05:26.900
- Don't you see
what's going on here?

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:30.167
Dippolito's forging an
alliance with the Japanese

01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:32.100
and Eastern European mobs.

01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:35.500
The DA's gonna go
ape shit over this.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.367
- The DA?

01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:37.567
- Yep.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:39.567
We gotta let Johnson
know as soon as possible

01:05:39.567 --> 01:05:41.833
so he can open up
another investigation

01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:43.767
into Dippolito's activities.

01:05:43.767 --> 01:05:44.600
- Yeah.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.600
I already talked to Johnson.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.400
- Yeah?

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.167
- You know, you never
got that wiretap approval

01:05:52.167 --> 01:05:53.067
from the judge.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.733
So here you are, wiretapping
Dippolito's club?

01:05:58.067 --> 01:05:58.900
- What?

01:06:00.167 --> 01:06:02.067
- The wiretap approval
you were trying to get

01:06:02.067 --> 01:06:03.500
that you never told me about.

01:06:04.833 --> 01:06:06.933
The judge never signed
the order, hotshot.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.433
- Are you kidding me?

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:12.833
- I asked you to
lay off and move on.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.567
Now you've got
yourself up the creek.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.400
I've gotta suspend
you indefinitely.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.300
- Oh Chief, come on,
this is bullshit.

01:06:24.333 --> 01:06:26.800
I know I broke your
protocol and I'm sorry,

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.200
but look we finally nailed
that douchebag Dippolito!

01:06:31.733 --> 01:06:33.400
- Your badge and
your gun, Driscoll.

01:06:38.467 --> 01:06:40.400
- I don't believe this.

01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:44.833
I don't believe this.

01:06:49.433 --> 01:06:51.300
That's my dart gun.

01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:43.533
- Why the hell did
you go to Kwong?

01:07:44.967 --> 01:07:47.167
He's the last person you
wanna get involved, here.

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:55.433
Now he's opened a
whole new can of worms.

01:07:55.433 --> 01:07:57.833
- We need to get those
guys that killed our men.

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.133
Russians can't deliver.

01:08:01.267 --> 01:08:03.433
And we're not waiting around.

01:08:03.433 --> 01:08:05.500
- Kwong's men missed Milan.

01:08:06.733 --> 01:08:08.100
They shot his girlfriend.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:15.767
- We are not leaving here
until we get those fuckers.

01:08:17.367 --> 01:08:21.100
If you can't take care of
it, we'll find someone else.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.433
- Listen Junior,
this is my town.

01:08:28.466 --> 01:08:31.533
No one makes any
moves without my okay.

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:35.867
- Oscar Kwong seems
to be doing things

01:08:35.867 --> 01:08:37.867
without your permission.

01:08:37.867 --> 01:08:39.899
- That fucking
prick needs to go.

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:44.399
It's only a matter
of time before he
crosses our path again.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:45.200
- No.

01:08:46.633 --> 01:08:47.867
A war is too costly.

01:08:50.933 --> 01:08:55.067
You talk to Kwong's
and Kryukov's people.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.267
We're gonna have a sit down
before things get outta hand.

01:09:17.832 --> 01:09:18.667
- We're unarmed.

01:09:19.633 --> 01:09:20.600
We're stepping out.

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:24.767
We're unarmed.

01:09:24.767 --> 01:09:25.633
This is no trick.

01:09:28.067 --> 01:09:29.200
Look, I just wanna talk.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.067
- You've got a lot of
nerve comin' here alone.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:45.700
- I want to make an offer.

01:09:47.067 --> 01:09:49.233
- You don't think you're walkin'
out of here alive, do you?

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.433
- Look the woman's death
had nothing to do with me.

01:09:57.433 --> 01:09:59.300
Those Japanese you killed,

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.433
they work for
someone called Nagai,

01:10:01.433 --> 01:10:03.633
and were friends
with Mr. Dippolito.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:04.867
They were responsible.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.100
- And your people
work for Dippolito.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.767
- No, not my people.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.400
I was against Kryukov's deals

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.400
with the Italians
from the beginning.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.367
- Who were the triggermen that
came after my lady and me?

01:10:16.367 --> 01:10:17.200
Japanese?

01:10:18.233 --> 01:10:19.100
- No, Chinese.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.233
- Chinese?

01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:25.367
- Yes, Chinese.

01:10:25.367 --> 01:10:27.867
They worked for someone
named Kwong, Oscar Kwong.

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.067
I can deliver you him.

01:10:31.067 --> 01:10:31.900
- Sure you can.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.167
- If Dippolito is after you,
no matter where you're going,

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:39.467
as long as he's alive
you're not safe.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.800
Let's go to my car, I have
something to show you.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.633
- Yeah right.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.700
- You can see I am unarmed.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.600
You can kill me anytime.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.167
I don't have any weapon on me.

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:51.000
Let's go.

01:10:52.067 --> 01:10:54.767
- Dara, watch him.

01:10:54.767 --> 01:10:57.200
If he makes a move, shoot him.

01:10:58.067 --> 01:10:58.900
- Be cool man.

01:11:05.867 --> 01:11:07.700
- You and I should
work together.

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.067
We have a common interest.

01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:12.200
I'll let you keep the drugs
you stole from Kryukov

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.100
and the money you
stole from Japanese.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.600
- You're
gonna let me keep it?

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.467
- Let me
show you something.

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.067
- The fuck is this?

01:11:27.067 --> 01:11:28.100
- Give me your gun.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.067
- What?

01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:30.167
- I said give me your gun.

01:11:31.533 --> 01:11:33.633
- Give it to him, Jack,
I got him covered.

01:11:46.867 --> 01:11:49.067
- Tomorrow night Dippolito's
holding a meeting

01:11:49.067 --> 01:11:50.700
with Oscar Kwong and his men.

01:11:51.633 --> 01:11:53.333
The Japanese will be there too.

01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:55.433
Also, men loyal to Kryukov.

01:11:55.433 --> 01:11:56.600
Everybody in one place.

01:11:58.833 --> 01:12:02.967
- Let me get this straight,
you're gonna double cross them

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.400
and you want us to
do your dirty work.

01:12:07.733 --> 01:12:10.500
- And you take over everybody's
operations in the city.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.800
- Yeah.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.067
- How convenient.

01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:13.833
- Why not?

01:12:14.933 --> 01:12:16.700
- Gimme one good
reason why I shouldn't

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.167
put a bullet in your eye.

01:12:19.567 --> 01:12:21.600
- Because without my eye,

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.100
you'll never see the man
who killed your woman.

01:14:06.467 --> 01:14:07.867
- Welcome back.

01:14:07.867 --> 01:14:10.067
- Listen, whaddya have for me?

01:14:10.067 --> 01:14:12.633
You know what I'm talkin' about.

01:14:12.633 --> 01:14:16.233
- Well I have Barrettas,
Glocks, Smith and Wessons.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.467
- I'd like to see that Barretta.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.133
- Barretta
97 Select-Fire 9mm.

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:33.133
- Beauty.

01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:38.900
I'll take that one.

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:43.833
- Oh, this is a MAC-11
9mm with a suppressor.

01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:44.933
Very high cyclic rate.

01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:51.433
- Let me see the Vector.

01:14:51.433 --> 01:14:52.433
- Oh, great weapon.

01:14:54.167 --> 01:14:59.167
Vector .45 Select-Fire,
lot of knocking down power.

01:15:08.633 --> 01:15:13.300
- Now, whaddya have
in the backroom?

01:15:16.067 --> 01:15:18.300
- That's reserved
for my select clients

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.433
and I think it's a little
bit out of your price range.

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:22.267
- Really?

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.467
I think this will
take care of it.

01:15:33.467 --> 01:15:35.467
- I think so, follow me.

01:15:39.633 --> 01:15:42.900
- Kenny, the one I want
most of all is the big boy.

01:15:51.567 --> 01:15:52.400
- I like it.

01:15:53.267 --> 01:15:54.700
- You think you can handle that?

01:15:56.267 --> 01:15:57.400
- What are you, a comedian?

01:16:08.267 --> 01:16:11.867
- When are you gonna get this
Driscoll bitch off of my case?

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:14.067
What the fuck do I pay you for?

01:16:14.067 --> 01:16:16.667
- Don't worry about it, Rusty,
it's already taken care of.

01:16:18.067 --> 01:16:20.767
You guys are making a
lot of noise around here.

01:16:20.767 --> 01:16:22.233
- And this Milan character?

01:16:22.233 --> 01:16:24.633
He's starting to be a
thorn in my side too.

01:16:24.633 --> 01:16:27.233
I want you to put
him outta commission.

01:16:27.233 --> 01:16:30.067
- Put him out of
commission?

01:16:32.367 --> 01:16:33.933
You stupid son of a bitch.

01:16:35.167 --> 01:16:36.167
You killed his girl.

01:16:37.367 --> 01:16:39.200
These special forces
guys stick together.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.300
Do you know what his
crew is capable of?

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.800
- That had nothing
to do with me.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.400
That was Oscar Kwong's people.

01:16:46.533 --> 01:16:48.133
We'll take care of him.

01:16:48.133 --> 01:16:49.700
- Kwong?

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:52.900
Oh not another war, not
in this town you don't.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.400
You're gonna put us all
over the front pages.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.300
- Relax Chief.

01:16:57.767 --> 01:17:00.533
We're gonna have a sit down
with Kwong and the Russians.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.333
- What about Milan?

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.200
- We'll take care of
him in our own way.

01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:12.600
Meanwhile I want you
to provide security

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.800
for my people at this sit down.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.800
Just in case Kwong
decides to get cute.

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:19.533
Now go on, take a hike.

01:17:20.767 --> 01:17:22.333
Nothing worse than a dirty cop.

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:35.167
- Um, whaddya think this
is, a fucking charity?

01:17:39.133 --> 01:17:39.967
- Pay the prick.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.267
- See ya.

01:18:14.633 --> 01:18:15.467
- Shit.

01:18:21.567 --> 01:18:23.167
Darcy, you asshole.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.800
- Dippolito's coming
with the bulk of his men.

01:18:34.067 --> 01:18:36.100
- Hey, what about the Chinese?

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.067
- They will be here too.

01:18:38.067 --> 01:18:39.467
They don't trust each other.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.433
Nagai's men will
be here as well.

01:18:43.433 --> 01:18:45.533
Just have your people ready.

01:18:45.533 --> 01:18:47.200
- What about
Kryukov's loyalists?

01:18:49.233 --> 01:18:51.800
- Don't worry, I'll
take care of them.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.900
- You better.

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.700
- Finally crawled
out of your shithole

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.200
to pay me respects, Oscar?

01:21:27.867 --> 01:21:28.800
- Fuck you!

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.633
- Do it to yourself.

01:21:31.633 --> 01:21:33.200
Raise your own little bastards,

01:21:34.367 --> 01:21:35.067
goddamn.

01:21:46.233 --> 01:21:47.867
- Nuh-uh, nuh-uh.

01:21:47.867 --> 01:21:50.700
That isn't a Q-tip, but it
will clean out your ears.

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:51.633
- What the?

01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:56.500
- I knew we had dirty
dicks in the department.

01:22:04.167 --> 01:22:05.300
- Where's Kryukov?

01:22:08.567 --> 01:22:10.633
- He couldn't make it today.

01:22:10.633 --> 01:22:12.267
He said to start without him.

01:22:16.633 --> 01:22:18.067
- Are you kidding me?

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:20.600
He doesn't come to
one of my meetings?

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.067
What's going on here, Boris?

01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:33.067
- Driscoll, you
bitch, you have no idea

01:22:33.067 --> 01:22:34.967
what you're getting
involved with.

01:22:34.967 --> 01:22:37.833
- Oh, I think I do,
because you're gonna be

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:40.767
Dippolito's baby
momma in the slammer.

01:22:40.767 --> 01:22:42.233
- That's
not gonna happen.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.800
- Oh, I think that
Judge Patterson

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.133
and District Attorney
Johnson would disagree.

01:22:49.133 --> 01:22:52.300
- You moron, who do you
think leaked Manzella's,

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.867
Lamandri's, and ever
other potential witness'

01:22:54.867 --> 01:22:56.167
whereabouts to Dippolito?

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.533
- What are you talking about?

01:23:00.533 --> 01:23:02.367
- I'm not going to jail.

01:23:02.367 --> 01:23:03.433
Neither is Dippolito.

01:23:04.867 --> 01:23:07.100
Everybody who's anybody in
this town is on his payroll.

01:23:08.967 --> 01:23:10.167
- Mother fucker.

01:23:13.067 --> 01:23:15.433
- He didn't mean any disrespect.

01:23:15.433 --> 01:23:17.100
He is really ill.

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.833
I'm here to represent him.

01:23:18.833 --> 01:23:21.067
- Your Jap friends
still owe me money.

01:23:21.067 --> 01:23:23.233
- Alright, alright,
we'll get around to that.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:27.067
But first thing we gotta
talk about this guy Milan.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.567
He's been trying to
find ways to get all--

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:41.700
Mr. Nagai!

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:42.567
Mr. Nagai!

01:23:44.433 --> 01:23:47.733
Please, please, calm down.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.833
- We don't take orders
from you, old man.

01:23:58.067 --> 01:23:59.100
- Everybody calm down.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.767
Now look, we have a
common enemy here.

01:24:03.933 --> 01:24:08.067
Milan and his crew,
they know that you

01:24:08.067 --> 01:24:11.067
accepted the contract that
killed his girlfriend.

01:27:58.267 --> 01:27:59.800
- Go eat some dog you fuck!

01:28:20.433 --> 01:28:22.433
- An eye for an eye.

01:28:22.433 --> 01:28:24.067
We got him, Baby.

01:28:24.067 --> 01:28:25.867
We got him.

01:29:10.867 --> 01:29:12.333
- Vengeance is ours, Theresa.

01:29:33.967 --> 01:29:34.800
- Fuck.

01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:31.100
- Milan, what can I say?

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.567
I owe you one.

01:32:35.633 --> 01:32:37.100
Thanks.

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:40.700
Because of that, I'm
gonna give you a seven...

01:32:42.833 --> 01:32:45.567
No, I think I'm gonna give
you a five minute head start

01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:48.067
before I shoot you in the back.

01:32:50.233 --> 01:32:53.067
Hey, tick tock tick tock.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:57.167
Come on, you guys are
wasting your time.

01:32:57.167 --> 01:32:58.433
Get outta here!

01:32:58.433 --> 01:33:02.067
Go on, get outta here
before I change my mind.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.167
Don't ever come back.

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:48.067
- Help me up, let's
get outta here.
