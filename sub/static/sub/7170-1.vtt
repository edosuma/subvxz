00:09.576 --> 00:12.211
<i> Anyone else</i>
<i> would die here of thirst</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:12.778
<i> in a few days,</i>

00:12.780 --> 00:16.181
<i> because in this arid desert</i>
<i> that looks like a paradise,</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:17.516
<i> there is no surface water,</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:20.519
<i> but the slender and graceful</i>
<i> little bushmen</i>

00:20.521 --> 00:21.787
<i> of the deep kalahari</i>

00:21.789 --> 00:23.222
<i> live here quite contentedly,</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:28.160
<i> and in complete Harmony</i>
<i> with their environment.</i>

00:45.311 --> 00:48.747
<i> They have lived undisturbed</i>
<i> for 20,000 years</i>

00:48.749 --> 00:51.050
<i> because they are</i>
<i> the only people in the world</i>

00:51.052 --> 00:55.387
<i> who know how to live</i>
<i> without surface water.</i>

00:56.356 --> 00:59.291
<i> When ivory poachers</i>
<i> in high-tech vehicles</i>

00:59.293 --> 01:01.493
<i> intrude into this</i>
<i> vast thirst-land</i>

01:01.495 --> 01:02.394
<i> to hunt elephant,</i>

01:02.396 --> 01:06.198
<i> they have to drag giant</i>
<i> reservoirs of water with them,</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:07.766
<i> and when the water runs low,</i>

01:07.768 --> 01:14.273
<i> they have to hightail it</i>
<i> out of the kalahari again...</i>

01:15.208 --> 01:18.177
<i> So the bushmen work and play</i>
<i> in peaceful isolation,</i>

01:18.179 --> 01:21.847
<i> quite unaware</i>
<i> of the crowded and hectic world</i>

01:21.849 --> 01:23.849
<i> outside their domain,</i>

01:23.851 --> 01:25.751
<i> and even of the wars</i>
<i> that are being fought</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:29.521
<i> on the very fringes</i>
<i> of the kalahari.</i>

01:29.789 --> 01:31.423
<i> Sometimes</i>
<i> xixo tells about the time</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:34.193
<i> when he went to look</i>
<i> for the end of the earth,</i>

01:34.195 --> 01:36.261
<i> and about the strange</i>
<i> heavy people</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:37.429
<i> he met on his journey,</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:40.299
<i> but he finds it difficult</i>
<i> to describe the beings</i>

01:40.301 --> 01:41.533
<i> who live outside the kalahari,</i>

01:41.535 --> 01:42.701
<i> and he always ends up by saying</i>

01:42.703 --> 01:44.403
<i> that the heavy people</i>
<i> are persons</i>

01:44.405 --> 01:45.471
<i> who seem to know some magic</i>

01:45.473 --> 01:47.739
<i> that can make things move,</i>
<i> and even fly,</i>

01:47.741 --> 01:50.375
<i> but that they're</i>
<i> not very bright,</i>

01:50.377 --> 01:52.177
<i> because they can't survive</i>

01:52.179 --> 01:53.879
<i> without their</i>
<i> magic contrivances.</i>

01:53.881 --> 01:56.782
<i> In the mornings,</i>
<i> they like to read the news.</i>

01:56.784 --> 01:59.785
<i> They can read that the hyena</i>
<i> has a new girlfriend,</i>

01:59.787 --> 02:02.221
<i> that the cheetah</i>
<i> has lost one of her babies,</i>

02:02.223 --> 02:05.657
<i> and the oryx is starting</i>
<i> to migrate to the west.</i>

02:05.659 --> 02:07.292
<i> The older children</i>
<i> teach the younger ones</i>

02:07.294 --> 02:10.195
<i> how to read all the gossip</i>
<i> about their neighbors,</i>

02:10.197 --> 02:10.829
<i> the animals,</i>

02:10.830 --> 02:13.599
<i> because everything that happens</i>
<i> in the kalahari</i>

02:13.601 --> 02:16.502
<i> gets printed out in the sand.</i>

02:17.570 --> 02:20.405
So it's all
printed out here.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.608
This is where they
started infringing

02:22.610 --> 02:24.443
on your client's patent.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.346
Give it to me there.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.582
Now, that I can present
in court.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.885
Go back to frame a...

02:32.887 --> 02:35.487
And give me sales.

02:36.523 --> 02:37.623
Oh, go away, Geoffrey.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.724
Cathy, will you take this?

02:38.726 --> 02:41.360
Okay.
Take him off.

02:41.628 --> 02:45.764
Now, cost per unit,
and a printout on that.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.934
Mr. Geoffrey says he has to go
to Hong Kong about the takeover.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.869
Okay, tell him
"have a good flight."

02:50.871 --> 02:52.905
So he won't make
the ecacl conference.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.373
He can't do that to me.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.440
He said he'd like you

02:55.442 --> 02:56.275
to read the paper,

02:56.277 --> 02:58.877
says you did
most of the research,

02:58.879 --> 02:59.878
so you deserve
the honor.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.180
I deserve to be left alone

03:01.182 --> 03:03.382
so I can go to court
on Wednesday.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.350
You'll be back
before Wednesday.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.552
Oh, boy.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.821
<i> That morning,</i>
<i> xabe came out of the forest</i>

03:09.823 --> 03:11.957
<i> with the news</i>
<i> that some of the animals</i>

03:11.959 --> 03:12.858
<i> had started moving</i>

03:12.860 --> 03:15.227
<i> towards the marula groves</i>
<i> in the north.</i>

03:15.229 --> 03:16.695
<i> He ran up to his father</i>
<i> and shouted,</i>

03:16.697 --> 03:19.765
<i> "the marulas are ripe.</i>
<i> Let's go and collect some."</i>

03:19.767 --> 03:23.402
<i> Then xisa and little xiri</i>
<i> ran up and said,</i>

03:23.404 --> 03:24.503
<i> "can we come too?"</i>

03:24.505 --> 03:28.640
<i> Xixo said, "let's see</i>
<i> if you're big enough yet.</i>

03:28.642 --> 03:29.908
<i> If you're taller than my bow,</i>

03:29.910 --> 03:33.245
<i> the hyena will be afraid of you</i>
<i> and he'll keep his distance,</i>

03:33.247 --> 03:36.381
<i> but if you're shorter,</i>
<i> he'll take you,"</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:42.354
<i> but xiri said,</i>
<i> "please let me come too,"</i>

03:42.356 --> 03:42.955
<i> and xisa said,</i>

03:42.957 --> 03:45.924
<i> "i promise I'll always</i>
<i> stay close to him."</i>

03:45.926 --> 03:48.493
Where are they
having the conference this year?

03:48.495 --> 03:49.795
In okakarara.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.797
Where's that, Nebraska?

03:51.799 --> 03:52.998
No, Africa.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.901
Oh, boy.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.909
<i> They gathered a lot of marulas,</i>

04:03.911 --> 04:04.843
<i> and on the way home,</i>

04:04.845 --> 04:09.481
<i> they came across the spoor</i>
<i> of a wounded elephant.</i>

04:14.721 --> 04:15.787
<i> Xixo said,</i>

04:15.789 --> 04:17.990
<i> "this elephant is very weak.</i>
<i> It's going to die."</i>

04:17.992 --> 04:22.327
<i> He said to xisa,</i>
<i> "you and xiri can go on home.</i>

04:22.329 --> 04:23.395
<i> "Tell your mother we will come</i>

04:23.397 --> 04:27.599
<i> when we've</i>
<i> found the sick elephant."</i>

04:50.690 --> 04:53.959
<i> There was a very strange</i>
<i> and very beautiful pattern</i>

04:53.961 --> 04:55.727
<i> on the ground.</i>

04:55.729 --> 04:56.695
<i> Xisa couldn't read it.</i>

04:56.697 --> 05:00.799
<i> She'd never seen</i>
<i> anything like it in her life.</i>

05:00.801 --> 05:02.034
<i> There was another one,</i>

05:02.036 --> 05:04.736
<i> just as beautiful</i>
<i> as the first one.</i>

05:04.738 --> 05:06.038
<i> She wondered how anything</i>

05:06.040 --> 05:09.041
<i> could make</i>
<i> such a long, unbroken track.</i>

05:13.813 --> 05:14.980
<i> She followed the track</i>

05:14.982 --> 05:20.452
<i> and saw</i>
<i> a very strange-looking thing.</i>

05:38.638 --> 05:40.439
<i> She said, "you see,</i>

05:40.441 --> 05:41.740
<i> "this thing</i>
<i> went round and round,</i>

05:41.742 --> 05:44.476
<i> "and that's how it made</i>
<i> such a long pattern</i>

05:44.478 --> 05:47.379
<i> without footprints."</i>

05:57.056 --> 05:59.825
<i> Xiri saw</i>
<i> a beautiful dewdrop grow,</i>

05:59.827 --> 06:00.759
<i> and when it dropped,</i>

06:00.761 --> 06:03.428
<i> another one began</i>
<i> to grow in its place.</i>

06:10.703 --> 06:11.737
<i> They knew that the gods</i>

06:11.739 --> 06:14.005
<i> always put dewdrops on plants</i>
<i> in the night,</i>

06:14.007 --> 06:16.475
<i> but here they could see</i>
<i> a dewdrop form</i>

06:16.477 --> 06:18.443
<i> in broad daylight.</i>

06:20.513 --> 06:24.783
<i> Xisa said, "i think this thing</i>
<i> is making the water."</i>

06:50.676 --> 06:53.812
<i> Xiri had never seen</i>
<i> so much water in his life.</i>

06:53.814 --> 06:56.181
<i> He didn't know</i>
<i> there was so much water</i>

06:56.183 --> 06:59.451
<i> in the whole world.</i>

07:35.555 --> 07:36.555
<i> They found the elephant,</i>

07:36.557 --> 07:40.192
<i> and they saw the tiny wound</i>
<i> that had made it die.</i>

07:40.194 --> 07:41.126
<i> The tracks told xixo</i>

07:41.128 --> 07:43.028
<i> the heavy people</i>
<i> had been there,</i>

07:43.030 --> 07:43.895
<i> and he wondered</i>

07:43.897 --> 07:45.497
<i> why they had taken</i>
<i> the useless tusks</i>

07:45.499 --> 07:47.566
<i> and had left</i>
<i> all the valuable meat to rot.</i>

07:47.568 --> 07:49.968
<i> He said, "the heavy people</i>
<i> do strange things."</i>

07:49.970 --> 07:52.070
<i> Bo said,</i>
<i> "I'll call xabo's family</i>

07:52.072 --> 07:53.071
<i> to help us eat the meat.</i>

07:53.073 --> 07:56.608
<i> If I run all day and all night,</i>
<i> I can find them by tomorrow,"</i>

07:56.610 --> 08:02.781
<i> and xixo said,</i>
<i> "we'll go and call our family."</i>

08:39.652 --> 08:40.585
<i> There were many tusks.</i>

08:40.587 --> 08:43.621
<i> It takes the gods</i>
<i> more than a man's lifetime</i>

08:43.624 --> 08:44.689
<i> to make a full-grown elephant,</i>

08:44.691 --> 08:50.061
<i> and it horrified them to see</i>
<i> that so many had died.</i>

08:57.904 --> 08:59.137
<i> Xixo and xabe found the place</i>

08:59.139 --> 09:02.007
<i> where xisa and xiri's tracks</i>
<i> suddenly stopped.</i>

09:02.009 --> 09:04.776
<i> Xixo said, "look,</i>
<i> xisa climbed onto the thing,</i>

09:04.778 --> 09:08.013
<i> and then xiri went up too,</i>
<i> and it took them away."</i>

09:08.015 --> 09:10.248
<i> He said, "tell our family</i>

09:10.250 --> 09:12.183
<i> "they must go</i>
<i> to the dead elephant</i>

09:12.185 --> 09:13.685
<i> "and start eating it.</i>

09:13.687 --> 09:16.321
<i> I'll fetch xisa and xiri."</i>

09:26.232 --> 09:27.832
I'm sorry you
had to come

09:27.834 --> 09:28.733
on such short notice,

09:28.735 --> 09:30.869
but we're very honored
to have you.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.971
I would've liked
going on the safari tour,

09:32.973 --> 09:34.306
but I have to prepare
my presentation.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.608
You're sure you'll be
all right here?

09:36.610 --> 09:37.742
I'll be fine, thank you.

09:37.744 --> 09:42.314
Good, I'll
leave you to it.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.619
You know where
Stephen's working?

09:47.621 --> 09:50.088
Yeah, I think I've
got a rough idea.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.792
Well, you may have to search
around for him a bit.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.193
Right.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.861
And Jack?

09:56.863 --> 09:57.295
Yeah?

09:57.297 --> 10:01.066
Tell Stephen we'll send
the rest out to him later.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.601
Right.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.337
What's a nice girl
like you

10:05.339 --> 10:07.372
doing in a place
like this?

10:08.774 --> 10:09.741
Oh, boy.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.042
You don't buy it.

10:11.044 --> 10:11.710
Uh-uh.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.878
Okay, I'll try again.

10:15.681 --> 10:16.114
Hi.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.616
How would you like
to come fly with me?

10:17.618 --> 10:20.919
I have to work this. That's why
i turned down the safari trip.

10:20.921 --> 10:21.920
Trip's three hours.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.021
I'll show you lots of Africa

10:23.023 --> 10:24.789
in a half an hour.
What do you say?

10:24.791 --> 10:28.159
I have to present this
at 3:30, you know.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.763
Oops.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.765
Only half an hour?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.734
Yes, doctor.

10:36.836 --> 10:40.171
So, what are you,
a doctor of medicine?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.340
No, corporate law.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.174
What a tiny plane.

10:43.176 --> 10:46.645
We have a smaller one,
but we can't find it.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.347
Can it fly?

10:49.349 --> 10:52.317
In you go.

11:09.935 --> 11:12.070
What are those?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.438
Buffalo.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.915
Look, no hands.
Flies by itself.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.151
Safest plane
in the world.

11:34.927 --> 11:35.960
Coffee.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.229
Morning, boss.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.932
You only done 80 miles.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.802
Yeah, I slept
a little bit.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.335
You stopped.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.105
I was bushed,
so I pulled up and...

11:47.107 --> 11:50.442
You slept more
than four hours.

11:50.444 --> 11:51.209
I was real pooped.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.244
I told you
we're running late.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.213
I was really pooped, boss.

11:55.215 --> 11:55.980
Move over.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.216
It's okay, boss, I'm fresh now.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.819
Get.
Jeez, boss.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.395
Lazy bastard.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.336
Get back to sleep.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.205
I'm wide awake now.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.106
Sleep.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.441
Yes, boss.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.140
I'll be right back.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.275
Mm-hmm.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.127
Hi, Stephen.
Hi, thanks.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.395
You're cutting it fine,
you know.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.230
There's a hell of a cumulus
building up.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.232
One of those thermals
grabs hold of you,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.835
it's going to whip you
right over the escarpment.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.037
You'll be 20, 30,000 feet.

13:26.039 --> 13:26.538
See you later.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.474
<i> Stephen,</i>
<i> is Geoff there yet? Over.</i>

13:29.476 --> 13:30.108
Hi, Bob.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.509
Yes, he's here. Over.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.011
<i> Can you fly back</i>
<i> in with him?</i>

13:33.013 --> 13:36.581
<i> We found a baby giraffe</i>
<i> that looks very sick.</i>

13:36.583 --> 13:39.050
<i> We need your advice. Over.</i>

13:39.052 --> 13:42.487
Okay. Out.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.193
You know you're
not supposed

13:48.195 --> 13:50.094
to cart your floozies
around in that.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.930
No, she's not a floozy.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.532
Hi.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.167
Morning.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.981
Do you do some kind
of work around here?

14:22.862 --> 14:26.231
<i> Hello, Stephen.</i>
<i> Come in. Over.</i>

14:26.233 --> 14:28.333
<i> Stephen, are you there?</i>
<i> Over.</i>

14:28.335 --> 14:32.337
<i> Hello, Stephen.</i>
<i> Come in. Over.</i>

14:32.339 --> 14:33.605
Hi, Bob,
this is Jack. Over.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.373
<i> Jack, don't take off yet.</i>

14:35.375 --> 14:36.341
<i> There's a freak storm</i>

14:36.343 --> 14:39.210
<i> moving in very fast</i>
<i> across the escarpment.</i>

14:39.212 --> 14:39.644
<i> Over.</i>

14:39.646 --> 14:43.214
Uh, Bob, they've
just taken off.

14:43.216 --> 14:43.882
Over.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.584
<i> They? Is there someone</i>
<i> else with him? Over.</i>

14:46.586 --> 14:48.386
Yes. Over.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.320
<i> Who? Over.</i>

14:49.322 --> 14:52.390
Uh, there was
this young lady. Over.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.159
<i> Was she with you? Over.</i>

14:55.161 --> 14:57.195
Uh, sort of. Over.

14:57.197 --> 15:01.232
<i> Boy, you're</i>
<i> in trouble. Over.</i>

15:01.234 --> 15:05.103
Over.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.173
<i> Xixo's old friend waka</i>
<i> was standing there,</i>

15:09.175 --> 15:12.176
<i> looking at the tracks</i>
<i> the heavy people had made.</i>

15:12.178 --> 15:13.111
<i> Xixo greeted him,</i>

15:13.113 --> 15:14.145
<i> and told him that his children</i>

15:14.147 --> 15:17.282
<i> were in the thing</i>
<i> that had made the tracks.</i>

15:17.284 --> 15:18.416
<i> Waka greeted him back,</i>

15:18.418 --> 15:21.920
<i> and said, "I'll come with you</i>
<i> to find your children,"</i>

15:21.922 --> 15:22.520
<i> but xixo said,</i>

15:22.522 --> 15:24.589
<i> "there's a dead elephant</i>
<i> back there.</i>

15:24.591 --> 15:25.924
<i> "Go there with your family,</i>

15:25.926 --> 15:30.328
<i> so that they can</i>
<i> help my family eat it."</i>

16:53.345 --> 16:54.278
They stopped.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.747
I think there's
some whiskey

16:55.749 --> 16:56.681
under your seat.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.149
No thanks, I'm okay.

16:58.151 --> 16:58.649
Give it to me.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.651
You're going
to start drinking?

17:00.653 --> 17:03.454
Give me.

17:13.398 --> 17:16.467
Can this thing fly
on scotch?

17:44.229 --> 17:47.165
George.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.366
Boss?

17:48.368 --> 17:51.269
Take over.

17:55.474 --> 17:56.607
<i> Xisa said,</i>

17:56.609 --> 18:00.178
<i> "when this thing gets tired,</i>
<i> it will stop to rest,</i>

18:00.180 --> 18:03.448
<i> then we can follow the tracks</i>
<i> back home."</i>

18:21.701 --> 18:24.669
Running out of scotch.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.473
This any good?
Uh-uh.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.817
We're flying backwards.

19:55.594 --> 20:00.531
I have to read my paper at 3:30.

20:03.468 --> 20:04.335
How do I get back?

20:04.337 --> 20:08.339
We have to find a road
so I can hitch a ride.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.413
So which way
to the nearest road?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.582
This is baobab country.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.516
Oh, it can speak.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.952
We're at least
300 miles from base.

20:20.954 --> 20:21.852
Oh, boy.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.322
Maybe more.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.733
I'm sorry.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.434
Any time.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.702
I have to get
to a telephone.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.704
I don't even know
what country we're in.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.406
That was one
hell of a storm.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.008
Hey!

20:44.010 --> 20:45.276
Great. Great.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.811
They're not scared of me.

20:46.813 --> 20:47.345
So?

20:47.347 --> 20:50.748
They don't know about people.
We're in the deep kalahari.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.950
Will they find us here?

20:52.952 --> 20:53.718
Eventually.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.319
Well, how long
is eventually?

20:55.321 --> 20:57.989
Maybe a day,
maybe a week.

20:57.991 --> 21:01.259
A week? I have to be back
in New York on Wednesday.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.960
You're from New York?

21:02.962 --> 21:04.595
You mean I have
to survive here for a week?

21:04.597 --> 21:07.632
Anyone who can survive
in New York can survive here.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.700
We'll starve to death.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.370
There's enough food around here.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.372
Our problem
will be water.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.575
All we have
is that six-pack up there.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.384
<i> They were getting</i>
<i> quite thirsty,</i>

21:26.386 --> 21:30.988
<i> but they knew where</i>
<i> there was plenty of water.</i>

22:16.368 --> 22:19.003
<i> She said, "no, I'm too heavy</i>
<i> for you to pull me up.</i>

22:19.005 --> 22:21.639
<i> "You come down here</i>
<i> so you can push me up.</i>

22:21.641 --> 22:24.342
<i> Then I can pull you up."</i>

22:34.920 --> 22:35.986
<i> Xiri had never been in water,</i>

22:35.988 --> 22:38.089
<i> but he soon</i>
<i> got used to the idea,</i>

22:38.091 --> 22:41.592
<i> and quite enjoyed it.</i>

22:44.029 --> 22:45.062
Is that water?

22:45.064 --> 22:47.465
Petrol. Gas.

22:47.467 --> 22:47.932
So?

22:47.934 --> 22:52.036
If I can get this thing down,
we can fly out.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.471
Today?

22:53.473 --> 22:55.773
I have to take it apart,
bring it down,

22:55.775 --> 22:56.907
assemble it again.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.676
Eventually.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.877
Maybe by tomorrow,

22:59.879 --> 23:02.012
the next day.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.616
Was that a lion?

23:06.651 --> 23:07.485
Yeah, I can hear them.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.653
Let down the rope.
I want to get up.

23:09.655 --> 23:10.621
They won't bother us.

23:10.623 --> 23:14.592
You're okay, they're bothering
the hell out of me down here.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.560
Will you let down
that rope?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.895
They're not coming this way.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.029
What about eventually?

23:19.031 --> 23:23.534
If you don't bother them,
they won't bother you.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.870
And if they're hungry?

23:25.872 --> 23:29.173
They're far from here.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.614
It's swarming
with wild animals down here.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.650
If don't bother them,
they won't bother you.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.519
I'm not bothering them.

23:47.493 --> 23:48.859
This one is drooling at me.

23:48.861 --> 23:52.196
It's a hyena.
They're always drooling.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.130
So?

23:53.132 --> 23:55.032
Ignore him.
Don't smile at him.

23:55.034 --> 23:55.633
Why not?

23:55.635 --> 23:58.569
He might think you're
threatening him.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.104
Let me get up there.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.147
You're enjoying this.

24:10.149 --> 24:10.815
Yeah.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.451
Why don't you relax
and enjoy it too?

24:13.453 --> 24:14.118
What's to enjoy?

24:14.120 --> 24:17.888
Wild animals all over the place,
no food, no water.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.924
No room service.

24:19.926 --> 24:20.925
Yeah, no plumbing.

24:20.927 --> 24:23.461
What I need is plumbing, now.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.762
Go behind that thicket.

24:24.764 --> 24:25.129
Alone?

24:25.131 --> 24:27.097
I mean, the lions are that way.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.033
They're very far.
If you don't bother them--

24:29.035 --> 24:33.637
they won't bother me.
I know, I know.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.510
How do I get down?

24:39.512 --> 24:41.045
How'd you get up there?

24:41.047 --> 24:43.147
The lion was roaring.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.048
Wasn't a lion.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.183
It was a hyena
sounding off.

24:49.588 --> 24:52.022
Right.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.527
Now, just a minute.
Turn your back.

24:56.928 --> 24:57.962
Pull me up.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.497
I can't. Friction.

24:59.499 --> 25:00.598
Then let me down.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.566
What do you
want me to do?

25:02.568 --> 25:03.567
Don't look at me.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.069
What do you
want me to do?

25:05.071 --> 25:07.538
Let me down,
let me down.

25:18.717 --> 25:21.252
What's so funny?

25:33.598 --> 25:35.299
Okay, I won't
bother you, see?

25:35.301 --> 25:37.635
So don't you bother me.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.772
Watch it!

25:41.774 --> 25:43.073
Go away!

25:43.075 --> 25:46.110
Run, run, run, run,
run, run.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.678
Get up a tree!

25:52.617 --> 25:53.183
You okay?

25:53.185 --> 25:55.986
You said
if I didn't bother them...

25:55.988 --> 25:57.955
I see there's a baby rhino
back there.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.992
Maybe the mother thought
you were molesting it.

26:01.994 --> 26:05.229
I only talked to it.
I didn't even smile at it.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.798
They're going.
They're going away now.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.699
I'm not coming down

26:08.701 --> 26:10.634
before you can fly me
out of here.

26:10.636 --> 26:13.904
There's no plumbing up there.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.359
You thirsty?

26:35.361 --> 26:35.960
Yes.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.729
All right, you can
have half a beer.

26:38.731 --> 26:39.930
Great.

26:39.932 --> 26:40.864
Don't open it yet.

26:40.866 --> 26:43.334
Sorry.
Oh, my goodness.

26:43.336 --> 26:46.637
Um...

26:48.974 --> 26:49.773
Sorry.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.909
What did I do wrong?

26:51.911 --> 26:54.111
Well, it's warm.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.813
Drink it now.

27:00.051 --> 27:03.754
Right.
It's getting late.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.924
We have to find food
before it gets dark.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.727
I saw an ostrich nest.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.386
Do they bite?

27:35.388 --> 27:37.788
No, they kick,
but they aren't very bright.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.090
If you lie down flat,
he can't see you.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.892
That's the male.

27:41.894 --> 27:42.993
He has
to guard the eggs,

27:42.995 --> 27:45.295
but if you can
distract him...

27:45.297 --> 27:49.433
How do I distract
a male ostrich?

28:48.393 --> 28:50.027
Lie down flat!

29:49.454 --> 29:50.354
<i> For a moment,</i>

29:50.356 --> 29:53.290
<i> xixo thought he saw</i>
<i> his children's footprints,</i>

29:53.292 --> 29:57.427
<i> but it was only a baboon</i>
<i> that had walked past.</i>

30:37.902 --> 30:38.569
So, what went wrong?

30:38.571 --> 30:41.004
Nothing.
We got the egg.

30:41.006 --> 30:46.143
You mean that was
standard procedure?

30:46.145 --> 30:48.011
Got a match?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.146
The thing came back.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.514
I'm sorry.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.883
You got a match?

30:52.885 --> 30:55.519
I've got a lighter.

31:18.142 --> 31:19.910
Big Ben
calling ramjee.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.478
Big Ben calling
ramjee.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.513
Do you read me?

31:23.515 --> 31:26.583
Ramjee, come in.
Big Ben calling.

31:26.585 --> 31:29.253
Come in, ramjee.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.420
Still out of range.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.356
Maybe they're
not there yet.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.524
He said he'll meet us
on the ninth.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.159
That's yesterday.

31:36.161 --> 31:39.096
Sorry, boss.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.471
<i> ...it is expected</i>

31:47.473 --> 31:51.108
<i> that 10,000 people</i>
<i> will attend the opening.</i>

31:51.110 --> 31:54.511
<i> Although nine helicopters</i>
<i> and four spotter planes</i>

31:54.513 --> 31:56.013
<i> are taking part</i>
<i> in the search,</i>

31:56.015 --> 31:58.916
<i> no sign of Dr. Marshall</i>
<i> and Dr. Taylor</i>

31:58.918 --> 32:00.117
<i> has been found.</i>

32:00.119 --> 32:01.018
Was that us?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.085
I suppose so.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.320
Doctor of what?

32:03.322 --> 32:04.354
Zoology.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.455
You?

32:05.457 --> 32:06.690
Law.

32:29.981 --> 32:30.948
We have to watch that guy.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.249
The hyena?
He's a hell of a coward.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.251
As long as you're taller
than him,

32:34.253 --> 32:35.986
he'll keep his distance,

32:35.988 --> 32:36.653
but if you lie down,

32:36.655 --> 32:39.156
he'll take a chunk out
of your face

32:39.158 --> 32:40.157
and your leg.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.425
You can take
the first watch.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.727
Call me when the moon
gets to there,

32:43.729 --> 32:45.162
and I'll take it
to there,

32:45.164 --> 32:49.599
and then you can take it
to first light.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.309
Coming down.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.415
I'm ready.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.783
For what?

33:42.587 --> 33:44.521
You only jumped
25 centimeters.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.757
What happened
to standard procedure?

33:46.759 --> 33:50.027
Maybe next time.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.295
Where are we going
to take off from?

33:52.297 --> 33:55.499
There's a salt pan
about three miles from here.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.167
How many blocks?

34:05.510 --> 34:08.779
Keep the sun over
your right shoulder.

34:08.781 --> 34:11.148
Stay clear of low branches.

34:18.156 --> 34:18.621
What?

34:18.623 --> 34:20.489
It's that damn rhino.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.324
It's a male. It's harmless.

34:22.327 --> 34:24.527
What are you always
climbing up trees for?

34:24.530 --> 34:25.762
I'm not a doctor of zoology.

34:25.764 --> 34:28.565
How am I supposed to know
about males and females?

34:28.567 --> 34:33.170
Damn near wrecked
the nose wheel.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.272
Give me slack.

34:45.716 --> 34:47.551
You only jumped 124 centimeters.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.485
These things are dangerous.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.088
It's very small.

34:51.090 --> 34:54.324
But when it grabs hold of you,
it never lets go.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.259
Kind of cute.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.596
Hey. No!

35:03.835 --> 35:05.602
Now we've got a flat.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.104
What do i
do with this?

35:07.106 --> 35:08.405
Why don't you
throw it away?

35:08.407 --> 35:10.540
It'll just come
right back.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.444
Can you change the tire?

35:14.446 --> 35:16.813
Can you undo my boot?

35:16.815 --> 35:19.149
It's the one
that stepped on him.

35:19.151 --> 35:19.549
So?

35:19.551 --> 35:23.820
If I give it to him,
he can have his revenge.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.666
There.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.267
Is there enough gas

36:10.269 --> 36:11.701
to take us
all the way back?

36:11.703 --> 36:14.504
If we get it
off the ground.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.780
No, it won't work.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.949
Can't you fix it?

36:25.951 --> 36:28.685
No pump.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.736
You want to be
the wheel.

36:46.738 --> 36:47.771
You're crazy.

36:47.773 --> 36:48.939
You see that stick?

36:48.941 --> 36:51.741
When I shout, "now,"
you bring it over this way.

36:51.743 --> 36:52.709
But I can't fly a plane.

36:52.711 --> 36:53.944
It'll lift your side
of the wing,

36:53.946 --> 36:57.314
then you center up. Push out
again, you pull it back.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.582
You see?

36:58.584 --> 37:00.717
Bring it over,
center up, pull it back.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.551
Then what?

37:01.553 --> 37:02.452
Then I'll take over.

37:02.454 --> 37:05.455
But I can't even
drive a manual.

37:05.457 --> 37:06.823
Do you want
to kill us both?

37:06.825 --> 37:07.557
You're nuts.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.926
I can't fly a plane,
you hear me?

37:09.928 --> 37:11.962
I can't fly a plane!

37:11.964 --> 37:13.663
Throttles.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.665
Shiny ones,
push them forward.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.801
Here we go!

37:17.803 --> 37:20.470
Come on.
Stick it back.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.271
Center up.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.706
I told you I can't fly.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.274
Pull back.

37:27.378 --> 37:29.613
Not way back.

37:30.448 --> 37:31.748
Pull it, pull it,
pull it.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.285
Will you make up
your mind?

37:35.287 --> 37:39.289
Bring her down.

37:39.291 --> 37:39.990
What?

37:39.992 --> 37:40.757
We go that way.

37:40.759 --> 37:44.961
You said you were
going to take over.

37:48.466 --> 37:52.936
You should have gone that way.
Oh, shit.

37:52.938 --> 37:53.637
Oh, shit!

37:53.639 --> 37:58.008
Ask a woman to do anything,
and she buggers it up.

38:01.846 --> 38:04.648
So she buggered it up.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.402
Just look down and read.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.537
It says "on. Off."

39:00.539 --> 39:03.406
Switch it off,
then you can glide.

39:13.751 --> 39:14.718
Ha ha!

39:14.720 --> 39:17.921
Whoa!

39:24.061 --> 39:26.796
I told you I can't fly.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.432
It says, "ballistic parachute,"
clearly and distinctly.

39:29.434 --> 39:34.471
Read it, press the button,
and you'll be okay.

39:39.610 --> 39:44.647
I told you I can't even
drive a manual.

39:46.083 --> 39:46.983
"Oh, it's easy."

39:46.985 --> 39:49.719
"Bring it over,
center it up, pull it back,

39:49.721 --> 39:51.121
and get it right, woman."

39:51.123 --> 39:52.021
I showed you so nicely.

39:52.023 --> 39:55.759
I said, "bring it over."
Not "bring it over!"

39:55.761 --> 39:57.694
You'll break your silly neck.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.796
You don't explain properly.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.966
I could have broken my neck.

40:07.838 --> 40:10.573
How the hell
am I going to find you

40:10.575 --> 40:11.908
with only one boot?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.910
Better find my boot.

40:26.056 --> 40:28.124
Shoo. Go away.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.974
Oh, shit.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.723
Wait!

41:37.928 --> 41:38.528
Hi.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.197
Do you want to
sell me your bike?

41:41.199 --> 41:46.202
Look, I'll give you money.

41:46.570 --> 41:49.539
I give you money,
you give me the bike.

41:50.775 --> 41:52.141
No, I have to go that way.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.543
There's a man there.

41:53.545 --> 41:56.212
I'll pay you,
you take me that way.

41:57.749 --> 42:02.652
Here. Please, I insist.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.955
Okay, I'll pay you
when we get there.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.591
There?

42:47.831 --> 42:51.701
Well, why don't we
try something else?

42:57.942 --> 42:59.976
Oh, yeah, sure.

42:59.978 --> 43:01.177
Oh, all right.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.746
Good thinking.

43:16.660 --> 43:19.829
Are you going to hang in there
forever?

43:28.706 --> 43:30.974
There. Lunch.

43:30.976 --> 43:32.609
Go on, try it.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.122
Okay, try that.

45:18.849 --> 45:22.351
Look, I'm really sorry.
Please take this.

45:23.722 --> 45:26.355
No, come on.

45:29.326 --> 45:30.159
Bye.

45:31.830 --> 45:33.162
Well, thanks.

45:33.164 --> 45:36.833
Bye. Got to find somebody.

46:04.895 --> 46:07.897
You said you were tired.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.803
Hey, go home.

46:48.071 --> 46:49.806
Go back to your family.

46:57.147 --> 46:58.247
Go on, get.

46:58.249 --> 47:01.484
Get. Shoo. Go.

50:23.253 --> 50:25.554
English?

50:26.690 --> 50:28.391
Okay.

50:28.393 --> 50:29.692
Get up.

50:33.363 --> 50:34.263
Move.

50:34.265 --> 50:35.297
Which way?

50:35.299 --> 50:36.699
To my Jeep.

50:36.701 --> 50:39.201
Stop.

50:39.203 --> 50:40.770
Where are you going?

50:40.772 --> 50:44.273
Where is your Jeep?

50:44.275 --> 50:49.545
We go to your Jeep.

50:58.488 --> 51:00.456
Stop.

51:07.397 --> 51:08.330
March.

51:08.332 --> 51:09.799
Which way?

51:12.335 --> 51:13.636
You know why a compass

51:13.638 --> 51:15.504
has a mirror on back?

51:18.208 --> 51:18.641
Why?

51:18.643 --> 51:21.277
So you can see who's lost.

51:21.845 --> 51:25.314
Okay, we go northwest.
That way.

51:25.316 --> 51:27.583
March.

52:18.668 --> 52:21.504
How far did you fly,
for Pete's sake?

52:21.506 --> 52:25.674
How the hell
am I going to find you?

53:46.389 --> 53:48.724
Damn!

54:15.352 --> 54:17.586
Hey!

54:17.588 --> 54:19.321
Hey, you, get away!

54:19.323 --> 54:21.824
Leave it alone.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.894
Get out of here.

54:29.432 --> 54:31.400
Give me back my can.

54:31.402 --> 54:33.402
Scumbag.

54:33.404 --> 54:37.940
You mugger.

54:42.545 --> 54:45.948
Thank you.

54:50.854 --> 54:53.489
You keep away.

54:55.992 --> 54:58.327
Stay there.

55:01.031 --> 55:02.698
See these?

55:02.700 --> 55:05.067
If you dare...

55:05.069 --> 55:08.671
Don't even think about it.

55:11.541 --> 55:15.577
You'll be sorry.

55:22.452 --> 55:23.919
Go away.

55:29.726 --> 55:32.761
Okay, you can have this one,
and no more.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.064
Leave the can.

55:35.066 --> 55:37.833
Do you hear me?

55:37.835 --> 55:41.637
Leave my can alone and go away.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.879
No, don't bring a friend.

55:50.881 --> 55:52.081
I'm not going
to water you,

55:52.083 --> 55:54.383
and your friends,
and your relatives,

55:54.385 --> 55:55.651
and I'm not--

55:55.653 --> 55:57.853
aah!

56:36.893 --> 56:38.894
Excerpts from
the Geneva convention.

56:38.896 --> 56:39.595
Forget it.

56:39.597 --> 56:42.531
It says here about
how a prisoner of war

56:42.533 --> 56:43.565
ought to be treated.

56:43.567 --> 56:45.033
"No prisoner of war

56:45.035 --> 56:46.802
"shall be subjected
to inhumane treatment.

56:46.804 --> 56:49.938
No outrage
shall be committed."

56:49.940 --> 56:51.640
Okay, stop.

56:51.642 --> 56:52.808
You can rest for three minutes.

56:52.810 --> 56:54.076
What's your bloody hurry?

56:54.078 --> 56:57.613
None of your business.

57:04.421 --> 57:07.423
Three minutes.

57:07.425 --> 57:09.458
I'm pooped, man.

57:13.930 --> 57:15.764
Hey! Don't do that!

57:15.766 --> 57:16.198
Come back.

57:16.200 --> 57:19.201
I'm going to report you
to the Geneva convention.

57:19.203 --> 57:20.869
Come back.

57:20.871 --> 57:22.838
You're my prisoner.

57:22.840 --> 57:24.873
Come back.

57:29.512 --> 57:33.849
Come out of there
and be my prisoner!

57:38.087 --> 57:40.823
You mustn't do that!

57:40.825 --> 57:42.891
March.

57:46.696 --> 57:47.596
So if you're so smart,

57:47.598 --> 57:52.501
how come you don't even know
what country you're in?

57:52.503 --> 57:55.671
So which way did they go?

57:58.942 --> 58:02.778
I'll just have to wait
till they come back.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.186
<i> Xixo saw a heavy person</i>
<i> dressed in funny clothes</i>

58:11.188 --> 58:13.155
<i> sitting next to the track,</i>
<i> talking to herself.</i>

58:13.157 --> 58:18.160
<i> She looked like a woman,</i>
<i> but she had a man's voice.</i>

58:24.668 --> 58:27.135
Hey.

58:28.905 --> 58:31.073
Oh, it's your way of greeting.

58:31.075 --> 58:33.709
We do it this way.

58:36.112 --> 58:36.745
Sorry.

58:36.747 --> 58:40.282
Okay. I'll do it your way.

58:40.284 --> 58:41.517
Hello.

58:41.519 --> 58:44.052
I'm very glad
to meet you.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.057
<i> He said,</i>
<i> "where is your family?"</i>

58:49.059 --> 58:52.928
<i> He looked at her tracks,</i>
<i> and said, "you are alone.</i>

58:52.930 --> 58:54.162
<i> "How did you get here?</i>

58:54.164 --> 58:55.797
<i> He said,</i>
<i> "i have to find my children.</i>

58:55.799 --> 58:58.000
<i> "There are two heavy people</i>
<i> playing some kind of game.</i>

58:58.002 --> 59:00.769
<i> "They went that way,</i>
<i> now I hear them coming.</i>

59:00.771 --> 59:03.038
<i> Perhaps they'll let you play</i>
<i> with them."</i>

59:03.040 --> 59:06.708
You want me to go
with you? Uh-huh.

59:20.957 --> 59:24.159
<i> He showed her the tracks</i>
<i> where he met the two heavy men.</i>

59:24.161 --> 59:27.763
<i> He said, "this is where</i>
<i> they turned back.</i>

59:27.765 --> 59:29.097
<i> "See how angry this one was,</i>

59:29.099 --> 59:32.134
<i> "because the tired one</i>
<i> grabbed the stick from him,</i>

59:32.136 --> 59:33.702
<i> "and then he had to run.</i>

59:33.704 --> 59:34.636
<i> It was very funny."</i>

59:34.638 --> 59:37.806
<i> But, of course,</i>
<i> she couldn't understand.</i>

59:37.808 --> 59:38.974
<i> She was also quite illiterate.</i>

59:38.976 --> 59:44.846
<i> She couldn't read</i>
<i> the signs and tracks at all.</i>

59:53.089 --> 59:56.258
We're waiting for a bus?

59:59.963 --> 01:00:03.065
Well, what do you know?

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:16.111
Go away. Bugger off.
I don't want to see you.

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:18.013
Stop!

01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:19.748
Who are you?

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:26.888
<i> Xixo couldn't understand</i>

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:30.158
<i> what these crazy people</i>
<i> were playing at.</i>

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.260
This thing penetrates.

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:33.929
You wouldn't
shoot a lady.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:36.632
<i> He said, "i have to go</i>
<i> and find my children."</i>

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:38.033
<i> He remembered</i>
<i> the men had bad manners,</i>

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:39.768
<i> so he didn't say goodbye</i>
<i> to them.</i>

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.704
I don't want to be involved
in your wars.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:43.905
I'm American.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:46.742
Okay.

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:50.345
Hey, you can't
leave me here.

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:53.315
You want me to die?

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:57.185
Get away from me.

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.290
Get away!

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.694
Try again, huh?

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.169
It's not fair.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:18.106
You can't both use me.
Let me go!

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:20.976
Let me go! Let me go!

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:24.346
Okay, drop it.

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:27.683
Drop it.
Yes, drop it.

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:33.789
Drop it, drop it, drop it!

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:40.128
Can't we negotiate?
I want to go home.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.731
If I don't get back to biera
by tomorrow night,

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:45.033
I'm going to miss my plane
back to Cuba,

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.702
then I'll spend
another six months

01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:47.369
in this goddamn Africa.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.938
And I've got to take you
to my base, now.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:52.007
Well, I have to be in New York
on Wednesday.

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:54.409
Sit down, and stay clear
of the goddamn Cuban.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:56.144
I'll stay clear
of goddamn both of you.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:02:00.215
I resent being used
as a hostage object.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.951
Got to be in New York
on Wednesday.

01:02:02.953 --> 01:02:04.986
You should have stayed there.

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:08.223
I didn't ask you
to come out here.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:11.893
I have to walk my ass off
to find you.

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.765
Well, good.

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:22.370
What's so funny?

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.947
Switch it on.

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:34.149
Big Ben calling ramjee.

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:36.418
Big Ben
calling ramjee.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.786
What are you doing?

01:02:37.788 --> 01:02:38.787
What am I doing?

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:39.321
Look at the sun.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:40.822
You're going
the wrong way.

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:42.858
Boss, I'm driving
on the compass.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.227
This thing is
made of steel.

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:48.497
You left it there.
Look at the needle.

01:02:48.499 --> 01:02:50.899
You buggered the compass,

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:51.800
you stupid bastard.

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:54.302
Jeez, boss,
i wasn't thinking.

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:57.806
Stop the bloody truck.

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.057
So when did you
put it there?

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:19.995
Well, I drank some coffee
just at sunrise, boss.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:22.097
Five hours.

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:25.300
40 degrees off.
Stupid bastard.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:28.136
Big Ben calling ramjee.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.437
Big Ben
calling ramjee.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.173
Do you read me,
for chrissakes?

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:32.541
Ramjee, come in.

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:35.944
<i> Big Ben, where</i>
<i> the hell are you?</i>

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:37.879
Look, I'm sorry.

01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:40.382
This idiot I've got here
bugged the compass.

01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:42.417
<i> I've been waiting</i>
<i> three bloody days.</i>

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:44.119
<i> Where the bloody hell</i>
<i> are you?</i>

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:45.554
We're
way off course.

01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:48.957
Now we have to backtrack
for at least five hours

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:52.360
to find our bearings.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.543
We're going back
in our tracks now,

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.912
so we'll be
out of range again.

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:11.847
I'll contact you

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:15.483
when we come back
into range.

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:32.467
<i> Little xiri saw hyena tracks.</i>

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.438
<i> The spoor was very fresh,</i>

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.006
<i> so he knew the hyena</i>
<i> must be close,</i>

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:44.212
<i> and it was downwind,</i>
<i> so it was sure to smell him.</i>

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.434
<i> He remembered</i>
<i> his father had said,</i>

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:08.970
<i> "if you're taller</i>
<i> than the hyena,</i>

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:11.640
<i> it'll keep its distance."</i>

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:18.914
<i> It couldn't understand</i>
<i> how this small creature</i>

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:20.916
<i> had grown tall so suddenly.</i>

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.998
<i> Perhaps the hyena hoped</i>

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.967
<i> that xiri</i>
<i> would get small again,</i>

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:39.935
<i> so it followed him...</i>

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:42.971
<i> At a respectful distance.</i>

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:55.417
Well, we got blown here
in a kind of a plane,

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:57.252
and then I kind of lost

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:59.187
Dr. Marshall.

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:00.722
Get in the Jeep.

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:03.258
Move.

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:11.700
Wait there.
Okay, but leave your bag.

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:12.467
Why?

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:13.468
You SWAT people.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.003
No, I won't,
i promise.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.738
Look, I'll take out
the rocks.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.540
You got rocks in there?

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:22.744
You drive.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:27.649
In there.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:35.657
Start her up.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.392
That way.

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:52.073
<i> Xixo saw another track</i>
<i> made by a heavy person,</i>

01:06:52.075 --> 01:06:54.342
<i> and the footprints</i>
<i> told of a man</i>

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.378
<i> who was in a bad way.</i>

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.278
<i> He spoke to the track.</i>

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.314
<i> He said,</i>
<i> "i can see you need help,</i>

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:02.384
<i> but I must find my children."</i>

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:17.799
Turn right.

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:20.168
Stop.

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:24.372
Hey, that's my Jeep.
I know, I knew it.

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.042
Go siphon.

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:30.678
Gas? But my tank
was almost empty.

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:33.815
Oh, boy.

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.369
Hi.

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.706
<i> Xixo said,</i>
<i> "i don't know what to do.</i>

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.842
<i> "You need someone</i>
<i> to find water for you,</i>

01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:02.544
<i> "but I'm worried</i>
<i> about my children.</i>

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:06.448
<i> "I've been running</i>
<i> for two days and a night,</i>

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:07.782
<i> "and I haven't found them.</i>

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:10.418
<i> I think they're very far."</i>

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:21.729
What have you got?

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:24.832
About two liters.

01:08:24.835 --> 01:08:26.768
14, 15 kilometers.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:27.769
How much have you got?

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.870
About
20 kilometers.

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:31.238
How far is your base?

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:32.774
60, 65.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:33.741
Oh, my god.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.243
My base is 20 kilometers.

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:37.745
Shut up. Get up.

01:08:40.515 --> 01:08:42.317
Watch it!

01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:44.886
Stop it!

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.524
I said, stop it!

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.229
Stop it right now!

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:05.273
Lady,

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.408
be careful with that.
Give it to me.

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:10.377
I'm the good guy here.
He's a bloody Cuban.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.845
Give it to me.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:14.716
Jeez, lady.

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:17.652
Yes, make my day.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:18.752
Okay, señorita.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:20.522
My base is only
20 kilometers away.

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:23.558
There's going to be
a plane to Cuba tomorrow.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.359
Give me the gun.
I'll take you there.

01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:26.761
This guy doesn't know
where he is.

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:28.529
You couldn't even
find your own Jeep.

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:30.832
How are you going
to find your base?

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:32.399
You find it.
You're so smart.

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:33.635
We're going to my base.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.336
Who says?
I says!

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:41.209
Stop it!

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:42.277
You,

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.679
get behind the wheel.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.180
No.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:46.881
No, get back.

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:50.285
You've got
to stay together.

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:53.587
Um...Take his hand.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.760
I said hold hands.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.434
Okay, get in.

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:14.976
You go around
that way.

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:22.850
Okay.

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:26.621
Now, can either of you
fly a plane?

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:27.755
Yeah, I can.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:28.690
Good.

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:31.759
Drive back to
where we started.

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:51.579
Watch it, boss!

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:58.720
Jeez, boss, we killed
a little kid.

01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:01.322
Sit down. We've got
to get out of here.

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:03.791
But, boss, it was
a little kid.

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:12.800
He's okay.
He's okay.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.887
Jeez, boss,
there's another one.

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:46.728
Xiri! Xiri!

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:49.797
Xiri! Xiri!

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.499
<i> Now xisa didn't know</i>
<i> which way to go.</i>

01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:55.570
<i> What if her little brother</i>
<i> had been left back there?</i>

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:14.756
Stop here.

01:13:14.758 --> 01:13:17.625
This is where
the bushman found me.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:21.162
That means
the plane must be...

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:30.738
That guy's
only bad news.

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:38.980
Follow him.
We're low on gas.

01:13:38.982 --> 01:13:41.115
Follow him.
We're low on gas.

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:43.551
Follow him.

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:45.046
Hi.

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:48.115
Hold hands.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:55.022
Get out that side.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:58.860
Go that way.

01:14:58.862 --> 01:15:02.864
Stop.

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:07.969
Goodbye. Thank you.

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:08.669
What happened?

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:14.208
It's nothing,
just kind of dehydrated.

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:22.250
Does "w" stand for water?

01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:26.287
I don't have to tell you.

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:37.231
Okay, open your mouth.

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:47.875
Who's the little guy
who gave me that stuff?

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:48.676
I don't know.

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:52.880
He just keeps on
appearing and disappearing.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.784
Who are they?

01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:57.952
They're soldiers.

01:15:57.954 --> 01:16:02.590
They look
very affectionate.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:06.193
No.

01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:07.628
Are they your prisoners?

01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:08.563
Kind of.

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:11.832
She hijacked my Jeep
and she kidnapped us.

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:14.735
You did it to me first.
Both of them.

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:16.203
He did it, then he did it.

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:17.805
She hit me first.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:18.973
You hit him?

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:20.308
Yeah.

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:22.577
She hit me too.
Damn near killed me.

01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:26.347
You hit them?
Took them prisoner with a gun?

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:28.583
Yeah.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.832
No, we're still
backtracking.

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.607
Keep going.

01:16:52.609 --> 01:16:54.008
Yes, boss.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.134
We nearly knocked over
another crazy bushman.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:22.236
<i> You're still in</i>
<i> bushmen country?</i>

01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:24.038
Oh, it beats me
where they come from.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.073
<i> You said nobody</i>
<i> would see you.</i>

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:27.975
Bushmen don't count.

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:35.883
Oh, my god.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:36.951
<i> Ben, what happened?</i>

01:17:36.953 --> 01:17:39.420
Bloody bushman was
crawling all over.

01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:42.323
<i> What do you mean,</i>
<i> "crawling all over"?</i>

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:46.661
What are you doing?
Hey, you okay?

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:48.162
What are you doing?

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:52.833
What are you doing?

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:55.336
What were you
doing up there?

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:56.737
<i> Did he see the ivory?</i>

01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:58.005
I don't know.
He must have.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.307
<i> Then you can't</i>
<i> let him go.</i>

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:01.776
That's right.

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:04.178
You a game warden?

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.080
Get him in here.

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:10.985
You come with us,
you get in there.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.688
Here.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:15.322
Boss?

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:16.057
Make him get in.

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:18.426
You come with us,
you get in there.

01:18:18.428 --> 01:18:20.961
You get in there.

01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:23.998
Hey, you mustn't do that.
Get in there.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.467
Can't you do anything right?

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:29.103
Jeez, boss.

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:31.472
Get me a tie-down.

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.375
What are you going to do, boss?

01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:35.242
They did it to me,

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:38.179
and he wants to go that way,
he wants to go that way.

01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:41.015
The one who's got the gun
gets to say where we go,

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:45.453
and I've got the gun,
and I say we go to the plane.

01:18:45.455 --> 01:18:47.354
Okay.

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.725
In the Jeep.

01:18:50.727 --> 01:18:52.393
When we get to the plane,

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:54.895
you can have
your Jeep back.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:55.763
And my gun.

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:57.865
We'll see about that.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:04.205
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

01:19:04.207 --> 01:19:06.173
It's his, boss.

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:12.413
Stop.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:15.783
Here are those
tracks again.

01:19:15.785 --> 01:19:17.284
Okay, the plane
must be that way.

01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:18.786
How are we going
to take off?

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:20.387
I'm not going to be
the wheel again.

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:21.388
Now we can fix it.

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:22.256
I don't see a pump.

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:24.225
Don't! You've got to watch them.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.000
Yours?
No.

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:33.501
Game rangers.

01:19:33.503 --> 01:19:35.836
What do we do, boss?
He's got a gun.

01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:36.971
Don't let him
see the ivory.

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:40.241
Maybe they've
got a pump.

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:48.282
Could you
lend us a pump?

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:50.818
What?

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.820
Could we borrow a pump with a--

01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:54.355
oh, no!

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:58.893
What have you done to him?

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.965
Drop that!

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.368
Throw it away!

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:12.106
George...

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:14.308
Get the gun.

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:24.018
What do we
do now, boss?

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:29.056
Tie them up.
Boss?

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:32.960
Give me that.

01:20:32.962 --> 01:20:35.329
Get the tie-downs.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:36.063
Jeez, boss.

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:36.997
What's this about?

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.465
I don't like
game rangers.

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:39.934
I'm not a game ranger.

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:40.501
Me too.

01:20:40.503 --> 01:20:43.003
This is all I've got, boss.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.306
Tie them two by two.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.859
What are we going
to do now, boss?

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:08.195
I've got to talk
to ramjee.

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:16.370
Big Ben calling ramjee.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:18.105
Do you read me?

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:20.374
Ramjee, do you read me?

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:22.476
Out of range again.

01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:23.544
George,
you see that dome?

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:26.447
I'm going to go up there
to get range.

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:30.150
Got to talk to ramjee
about this.

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:36.190
I'm leaving you
in charge.

01:21:36.192 --> 01:21:38.459
You watch these people.

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:56.176
Okay, now,
you people.

01:21:56.178 --> 01:21:59.280
You behave,
nobody gets hurt.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:02.583
Oh, my god.

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.964
Get the gun.

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:21.068
Hey, you mustn't
do that.

01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:22.436
My boss will
kill you.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.704
Got it.

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:27.241
Okay, let's go.

01:22:27.243 --> 01:22:28.208
Get in.

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:32.379
What do you mean,
"get in"?

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:36.016
Move it, man.

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:39.219
Mister, come with us.

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:41.956
I'm coming too.
He's going to kill me.

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:44.558
You, give me first gear.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.494
Hurry!

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:54.568
I knew it. I knew it.

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:56.403
I told you
we're low on gas.

01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:59.340
Let's get
out of here.

01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:05.679
Move your ass, man.

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:08.115
What a day.

01:23:08.117 --> 01:23:09.616
Game rangers, two soldiers,
and a woman.

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:11.352
<i> What did you</i>
<i> do with them?</i>

01:23:11.354 --> 01:23:13.587
I tied them up.

01:23:13.589 --> 01:23:15.356
What the hell?

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:20.327
George!

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:23.030
Yes, boss?

01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:40.047
Your turn.

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:44.551
Your turn!

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:45.686
No, it's not!

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:48.188
It is, it is!
No, it's not!

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:48.722
It is!

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:50.157
No, it's not!

01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:52.292
Okay, dammit.

01:23:52.294 --> 01:23:55.763
I'll get the bastard.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:28.262
No, get up.
Untie me.

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:42.076
Come on.

01:25:56.618 --> 01:26:00.554
Hey!

01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:03.824
Oh, no, man.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:05.659
He's not so crazy.

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:09.830
He knows
what he's doing.

01:26:16.237 --> 01:26:19.273
He's making a firebreak.

01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:21.241
Clever little bugger.

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:54.508
It'll burn out now.

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:01.381
That's it.

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:06.353
They're your kids?

01:27:06.355 --> 01:27:07.354
Yes, we passed them back there.

01:27:07.356 --> 01:27:10.958
There's a tiny one
and then the other one.

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.759
Yeah, that way.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:16.496
Yeah.

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:22.336
Why are you crying?

01:27:22.338 --> 01:27:23.403
He lost his kids.

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:25.339
I told him where to find them.

01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:28.809
So you have
to disappear again.

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:34.414
Goodbye...

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:38.919
And thank you.

01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:39.987
Goodbye,

01:27:39.989 --> 01:27:41.955
and thank you.

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:31.772
Watch it!
He's got a gun!

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:36.710
Out of my way.

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:40.881
I want you to do that again.

01:28:40.883 --> 01:28:42.883
Do what?
What you just did.

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:43.784
What the hell for?

01:28:43.786 --> 01:28:44.918
It's a telescopic sight.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.687
He can't hit a moving target.

01:28:46.689 --> 01:28:47.454
No!

01:28:47.456 --> 01:28:48.088
When I say, "go,"

01:28:48.090 --> 01:28:50.857
you run around like crazy,
all right?

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:53.327
Go!

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:04.871
Stand still,

01:29:04.873 --> 01:29:06.506
you bastards.

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:24.624
Throw it away.

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:41.742
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm your goddamn prisoner.

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:43.377
I don't want you.

01:29:43.379 --> 01:29:47.514
You're a, you're a...
You're a shitty prisoner.

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:05.532
Xiri!

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.905
Okay, thank you.

01:32:24.907 --> 01:32:28.174
Okay, goodbye.

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:42.122
Bugger off to Cuba
and don't get lost.

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:47.227
See that hill over there?

01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:48.929
You head
straight for it,

01:32:48.931 --> 01:32:51.231
and you'll
find your Jeep.

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:57.804
Goodbye.

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:08.315
Okay, out.

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:13.720
You drive the Jeep.

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:16.122
Where we going, boss?

01:33:16.124 --> 01:33:16.890
To my base.

01:33:16.892 --> 01:33:17.791
How long will we get?

01:33:17.793 --> 01:33:18.792
Maybe you'll
get a year,

01:33:18.794 --> 01:33:23.863
but this bastard's
going to sit for a long time.

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:35.308
There are
12 spotter planes

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:36.109
and nine helicopters

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:38.645
searching the area
in a radius of 400 kilometers.

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:44.050
So we are covering an area

01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:46.119
of 20,000--

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.021
isn't this
where we kiss?

01:34:21.023 --> 01:34:22.222
Yes!

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.991
Pull me up! Pull me up!

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.194
You're tearing my dress!

01:34:28.196 --> 01:34:29.129
Let me down.

01:34:29.131 --> 01:34:31.031
No, pull me up.

01:34:31.033 --> 01:34:32.799
Don't bother.

01:34:32.801 --> 01:34:35.702
I can't see!

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:40.206
Oh, boy.

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:42.976
Now can you
do it right?

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:09.102
Daddy!
