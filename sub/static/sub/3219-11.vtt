39:46.884 --> 39:49.094
...but we're together.

39:51.263 --> 39:53.223
Thanks.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.374
You okay?

40:19.792 --> 40:22.919
You know, I felt
for those sons of bitches back there.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.923
Life-long torture
turns you into something like that.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.717
You were in hell, Dean.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.932
Look, maybe you did
what you did there...

40:36.392 --> 40:38.309
...but you're not them.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.353
They were barely human.

40:40.521 --> 40:44.065
Yeah, you're right. I wasn't like them.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.484
I was worse.

40:46.652 --> 40:48.736
They were animals, Sam,
defending territory.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.447
Me?

40:51.323 --> 40:53.700
I did it for the sheer pleasure.

40:55.035 --> 40:58.204
-What?
-I enjoyed it, Sam.

41:01.125 --> 41:05.336
They took me off the rack,
and I tortured souls, and I liked it.

41:07.798 --> 41:11.968
All those years, all that pain.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.180
Finally getting to deal some out yourself.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.058
I didn't care who they put in front of me.

41:19.643 --> 41:22.979
Because that pain I felt...

41:23.147 --> 41:25.440
...it just slipped away.

41:27.693 --> 41:30.612
No matter how many people I save...

41:31.614 --> 41:33.865
...I can't change that.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.703
I can't fill this hole.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.374
Not ever.
