00:21.354 --> 00:23.064


00:26.526 --> 00:28.153


00:28.236 --> 00:29.195


00:29.279 --> 00:31.364
Ah, this is the life.

00:31.448 --> 00:35.535
"Borrowing" your dad's EZ-Shake Maker
was a stroke of genius.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.787
And thanks to
the Never-ending Fro-Yo option

00:37.871 --> 00:41.166
on my sisters' Multi-Ray,
we can enjoy them any time we want.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.837
Now hit me again, Dog!

00:47.797 --> 00:49.716


00:49.799 --> 00:51.634
OK, that's weird.

00:51.718 --> 00:55.013
Past-me, I'm future-you
from one week from now,

00:55.096 --> 00:57.182
and I only have five seconds to tell you

00:57.265 --> 00:59.350
that if you want to save
future-Porkbelly--

01:00.810 --> 01:03.021
I do! I want to save future-Porkbelly!

01:03.104 --> 01:05.982
But save it from what?
Future-me never said!

01:07.108 --> 01:10.487
Yes! And these EZ-Shakes
are the key to saving Porkbelly!

01:11.696 --> 01:14.824
-Brain freeze!

01:14.908 --> 01:17.202
-Don't stop making them because--

01:17.285 --> 01:20.747
Wait. Did future-usses just jack
now-us's milkshakes?

01:20.830 --> 01:23.708
How exactly is that more important
than saving Porkbelly?

01:23.792 --> 01:25.418
Which needs more shakes!

01:26.753 --> 01:28.004
You make an interesting point.

01:29.631 --> 01:33.551
Great, and please, keep 'em coming,
or Porkbelly is doomed!

01:34.594 --> 01:36.387
-And faster! Or else we will all…

01:36.471 --> 01:38.473
-You heard me!

01:38.556 --> 01:40.058
We're going too slow!

01:40.141 --> 01:43.478
OK, but faster means more sciencey!

01:44.103 --> 01:47.106
Combining the Blast, Shrink,
Growth, and Fro-Yo Ray

01:47.190 --> 01:49.984
into one Multi-Ray was a genius idea.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.904
And this new upgrade
will be even more genius,

01:52.987 --> 01:55.323
but which new rays should we create?

01:55.406 --> 01:59.035
Let's unlock the Multi-Ray
and test some options.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.289
Johnny!

02:03.373 --> 02:06.126
Yes, I borrowed your ray thingy,
but that's not important now.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.586
And exactly what is important?

02:08.670 --> 02:11.923
Future-me needs now-me
to save future-Porkbelly

02:12.006 --> 02:14.175
by making now-milkshakes
for future-me!

02:14.259 --> 02:17.387
-Now!
-And you know this how?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.681
Future-usses used
the Teahouse Time Machine

02:19.764 --> 02:23.560
to warn now-usses that unless we do,
Porkbelly is doomed!

02:23.643 --> 02:25.103
Doomed from what?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.063
Don't know.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.859
They can only come back for five seconds,
grab a shake, then disappear.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.237
Are you sure future-you
isn't just tricking now-you

02:34.320 --> 02:36.156
so you'll make him milkshakes?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.576
OK, that does sound like
the sort of trick I'd play on me.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.162
Heh heh. Classic future-you.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.705
And you!

02:43.788 --> 02:47.709
Wait, tell us exactly how often
future-you is coming back here.

02:47.792 --> 02:51.296
Overusing Time Machines,
or "hyper-jumping,"

02:51.379 --> 02:53.298
can cause a rift in space-time!

02:53.381 --> 02:55.383
Which horrible beings could escape from

02:55.466 --> 02:58.261
that actually could destroy
future-Porkbelly.

02:59.554 --> 03:03.016
Is three times in the last five minutes
considered a lot?

03:03.099 --> 03:04.267
Yes!

03:04.350 --> 03:08.521
We need to get to the future
and stop you before it's too late!

03:10.773 --> 03:12.066
This is not good.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.320
What could have caused
a space-time rift in the lab?

03:17.614 --> 03:20.033
Perhaps a little brother lame adventure.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.827
It wasn't lame.
It was for milkshakes.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.829
It was lame.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.081
OK, that is weird.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.710
We're one-week-ago-you
and trying to stop now-Johnny, and…

03:30.793 --> 03:31.711
Wait.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.796
Is that the upgraded Multi-Ray?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.759
Yup! It took us a while,
but we added a Super Strength Ray,

03:37.842 --> 03:40.011
Density Ray, and Fly Ray.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.889
However, we kept
the Endless Fro-Yo option.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.600
You're such geniuses!

03:47.685 --> 03:50.605
I can't believe how easy
past-you is to fool!

03:50.688 --> 03:53.566
I was pretty dumb
when I was younger, and…

03:53.650 --> 03:55.276
-Uh-oh.
-That's him-- me--

03:55.360 --> 03:58.988
who lied about a doomed future-Porkbelly,
then stole my milkshakes!

03:59.072 --> 04:03.243
After you stole Dad's EZ-Shake
and our Multi-Ray!

04:03.326 --> 04:06.162
But this isn't about me.
It's about me-him.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.707
Right, and you need to stop hyper-jumping.
Now.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.793
You're hyper-jumping?!

04:11.876 --> 04:14.254
Only because he broke the EZ-Shake Maker.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.463
I did?

04:15.546 --> 04:19.050
Then your Dad grounded you
from TV, video games, the lab,

04:19.133 --> 04:20.927
and me for a week.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.179
OK, that explains a lot.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.474
And since Johnny loves shakes
and hates getting in trouble…

04:26.557 --> 04:27.517
Bye!

04:32.438 --> 04:33.648
Uh-oh!

04:33.731 --> 04:36.693
One-week-ago-Johnny,
you need to stop him-you

04:36.776 --> 04:38.403
while we slow this time tear.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.240
And hurry!

04:43.241 --> 04:46.160
Just grab the whole thing,
and let's get outta here before…

04:47.912 --> 04:49.247
Before what?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.332
Dumb old-me gets here.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.835
You're the dumb me
for hyper-jumping through time

04:53.918 --> 04:55.461
and endangering future-Porkbelly!

04:55.545 --> 04:58.798
And isn't it your job
to stop us from doing dumb things?

04:58.881 --> 05:03.970
Yeah, but we both know you never listen.
Plus these shakes are amazing!

05:06.014 --> 05:07.181
He's not wrong.

05:07.265 --> 05:12.645
And now to enjoy endless shakes
where you-me will never find me-you!

05:17.275 --> 05:19.569
You know, past-you makes a good point.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.988
Maybe we should stop time-jumping.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.532
We could do that, or we could…

05:24.615 --> 05:26.951
make more shakes, Dog!

05:29.078 --> 05:32.165
Yeah, now-you makes a much better point.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.585
Oooh!

05:35.668 --> 05:38.171
Brain freeze!

05:38.796 --> 05:41.090
Ow! How did you find us?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.592
I'm you, remember?

05:42.675 --> 05:44.844
So I thought of a place
I'd never think to find me

05:44.927 --> 05:46.429
and got here five seconds before you.

05:47.638 --> 05:51.934
Now it's time to take us
and our delicious shakes back home.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.145
-Got him!

05:54.312 --> 05:56.522
I mean, I got me.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.648
I mean…

05:57.732 --> 05:59.150
Man, this is bittersweet.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.611
But good news, right? Heh heh.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.820
Bad news!

06:02.904 --> 06:06.282
That last hyper-jump
completely opened the time tear!

06:12.538 --> 06:15.333
Stand back,
and one Shrink-Ray coming up.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.710
Wait, future-us changed that to--

06:22.757 --> 06:25.093
…Super-Strength Ray.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.179
Well, maybe my future-sisters
should've warned me before I--

06:33.810 --> 06:36.104
So that just got way worse.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.482
<i>Hank Anchorman here</i>
<i>with breaking news…</i>

06:39.565 --> 06:41.025


06:41.109 --> 06:43.194
<i>…and breaking news vans!</i>

06:43.277 --> 06:44.987
<i>I'm here at City Hall</i>

06:45.071 --> 06:47.990
<i>where a monster-thing</i>
<i>is breaking everything,</i>

06:48.074 --> 06:50.993
<i>and it looks like</i>
<i>Porkbelly is doomed!</i>

06:52.036 --> 06:56.415
Well, you can't accuse me of lying,
cos Porkbelly really is doomed!

06:56.499 --> 07:00.002
Focus. We need to get
that thing back here.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.297
And into that time-rift,
then close it for good.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.924
We'll go after the monster thing.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.343
And we'll figure out
how to close the time tear.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.428
And Dukeys…

07:09.512 --> 07:13.099
We guard these delicious
and very vulnerable milkshakes.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.475
Got it!

07:14.559 --> 07:15.685
Meh.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.727
We're fine with that.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.812
Now…

07:17.895 --> 07:19.147
Go!

07:31.117 --> 07:33.661
OK, if that thing wasn't
about to destroy Porkbelly,

07:33.744 --> 07:35.204
I'd say he's pretty awesome.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.707
I know, right?
Maybe we're more alike than I thought!

07:37.790 --> 07:42.503
Yeah, cos I'm you.
Now, let's get this thing back to the lab!

07:44.213 --> 07:48.050
Hey! Ugly thing!
Let's see how you do against our…

07:48.926 --> 07:50.219
Density Ray!

07:50.303 --> 07:53.014
Which makes things incredibly heavy!

07:59.270 --> 08:01.272
Huh, that was almost too easy.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.987
Or not.

08:08.070 --> 08:12.158
Time for the Fly Ray,
which turns him into a tiny fly

08:12.241 --> 08:14.619
that we snatch and take back to the lab!

08:20.374 --> 08:22.335
Whoa, didn't see that comin'.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.628
But we really should have.

08:26.130 --> 08:29.884
Well, this thing does have one option
that we haven't tried.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.223
I believe that's our cue to…

08:35.306 --> 08:37.808
Skate!

08:43.022 --> 08:46.400
Almost done connecting the teahouses
to the rift inhibitor.

08:46.484 --> 08:50.530
Then by firing them up in reverse,
it will shrink the time-space tear

08:50.613 --> 08:52.281
to the point where it won't exist!

08:52.365 --> 08:54.158
And building it was a snap!

08:54.242 --> 08:57.161
It's like we each have two sets of hands.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.371
Literally.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.250
<i>Help!</i>

09:02.333 --> 09:04.669
<i>The luring him after us part worked great.</i>

09:04.752 --> 09:07.672
<i>But the us running away part…</i>
<i>not so much!</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:11.551
Yeah, I knew our part of the plan
was too good to be true.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.802
Yup.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.057
Well, it's been nice knowing me.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.851
And sorry for calling you
younger and dumb me.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.026
We've got you, Johnnys!

09:29.110 --> 09:30.611
Thanks, Dogs!

09:33.573 --> 09:35.408
When did that thing learn to fly?

09:37.451 --> 09:38.953
Get ready…

09:41.038 --> 09:42.999
He's right behind us,
and he's very angry!

09:46.627 --> 09:49.297
But he didn't fall into the inhibitor!

09:50.131 --> 09:53.551
Wow, to think this whole mess
was caused by milkshakes, huh?

09:53.634 --> 09:57.179
Which you always drink too fast
and end up with a brain freeze!

09:58.639 --> 10:00.308
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

10:00.391 --> 10:01.517
Always.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.729
One last milkshake comin' up!

10:09.984 --> 10:15.114
Time for a super charged
and super frozen milkshake brain freeze!

10:21.829 --> 10:23.873
Hit it, Dogs!

10:27.168 --> 10:29.629
Now, science it up, sisters!

10:40.264 --> 10:43.142
Hmm… It looks like
that time-energy pulse

10:43.225 --> 10:45.811
has transported us back to the present.

10:45.895 --> 10:50.441
And no sign of any time tear
or any inter-dimensional monster.

10:50.524 --> 10:55.321
But we do still have these,
and I know the perfect way to celebrate!

10:59.867 --> 11:02.161
Hey, future-me, I'm you from a week ago,

11:02.244 --> 11:04.914
and are there any pop quizzes
coming up, and…

11:04.997 --> 11:06.540
-Uh-oh.
-Huh.

11:06.624 --> 11:10.836
So that's how the Shake-Maker got broken
and why your dad grounded you.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.964
Well, see you in a week, everybody.
