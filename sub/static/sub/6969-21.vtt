As soon as I file it
with the city clerk.

00:19.966 --> 00:23.868
This pen--
she gave it to me.

00:23.937 --> 00:26.371
It was an anniversary present.

00:29.976 --> 00:32.500
- I don't remember which one.
- Walter.

They are expecting the signed documents
by the end of business today,

00:36.683 --> 00:38.651

- I know what time it is.

00:38.752 --> 00:40.686
Then you should sign.

00:45.726 --> 00:49.753
- What are you doing, Walter ?
- After 1 7 years,
they can wait another day.

00:49.830 --> 00:53.960
Listen. No one knows better than I
what an emotional experience this is.

00:54.034 --> 00:57.492
Don't lawyer me, Jane.

00:57.571 --> 01:00.369
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- Why put yourself through
another day of this ?

01:00.440 --> 01:03.273
I said tomorrow.

01:11.918 --> 01:15.012
- Buck, I think we have to wait.
- Bye !

another one ?

01:43.216 --> 01:45.150
Sure.

Thanks.

01:48.789 --> 01:52.156
For what ?
Ordering another drink ?

01:54.060 --> 01:57.496
There's a man behind me
wearing a red tie.

01:59.533 --> 02:04.493
For some reason, he felt compelled
to tell me half his life story.

02:04.571 --> 02:07.836
I was afraid if you got up,
he might try to get in the other half.

02:10.210 --> 02:14.203
I guess some people
think that you owe 'em something
just 'cause you’re out alone.

My name is Mulder. I work
with Assistant Director Skinner.
I'd like to speak with him.

04:43.697 --> 04:45.631
After he gives his statement. We're
gonna finish up at the station house.

a statement here ?

It's me. I just got your message.
You said Skinner called in a homicide.

05:00.413 --> 05:02.847
It appears to be a little
more complicated than that.

a front-row seat.

- I don't understand.
- I don't understand it either.

05:10.724 --> 05:14.182
Excuse me, sir ?

05:14.260 --> 05:18.856
I appreciate your concern, Agent Mulder,
but there's no need for you
to get involved.

05:20.433 --> 05:24.460
Detective. Detective.
Detective !

05:24.571 --> 05:27.039
Will you at least tell me what
happened ? What does he say happened ?

05:27.107 --> 05:29.667
He claims he met the victim
in the bar downstairs.

05:29.743 --> 05:33.235
After a couple of drinks, they decide
to get a room, which is all fine,

05:33.313 --> 05:37.249
except when he wakes up, he finds her
lying next to him with a broken neck.

05:37.317 --> 05:40.218
- That's all he says he remembers.
- You don't believe him ?

05:40.286 --> 05:44.154
He refused to take a polygraph test.
It's not helping his credibility.

05:44.224 --> 05:46.351
What about the victim ?
Has she been identified ?

05:46.426 --> 05:48.257
Not yet. She had no purse,
nothing with her name on it.

05:48.328 --> 05:51.195
There must be evidence
of an intruder of some kind.

05:51.297 --> 05:54.858
Agent Mulder, I've been on the job
for 1 8 years. I know the drill.

05:54.968 --> 05:57.766
Then if you know the drill,
you should be canvassing

05:57.837 --> 06:00.567
I appreciate that he's
a colleague of yours,

06:00.640 --> 06:04.701
but I want you to understand something:
He's also a suspect.

06:04.778 --> 06:07.212
Detective,

06:07.280 --> 06:11.910
when you're done questioning him,
I'd appreciate a call.

- Get any of that ?
- Most of it. Mulder, I'm on my way.

06:19.592 --> 06:22.117
No, no, no, I want you to take a look at
that body. Get down to the coroner's.

06:22.195 --> 06:24.663
I'll meet you there.

06:34.841 --> 06:38.174
The conspicuous absence
of any contusions or lacerations...

06:38.244 --> 06:43.147
would strongly suggest
that the victim's injuries were
sustained without a struggle.

06:43.216 --> 06:46.549
From my observations,
I would have to concur with
the county coroner's report...

06:46.619 --> 06:49.645
that her murder was most probably
a sudden and violent act...

06:49.723 --> 06:52.089
in a vulnerable moment.

06:52.158 --> 06:55.286
Beyond this, I found nothing
in my postmortem examination...

06:55.361 --> 06:57.921
- to recommend further investigation.
- Beyond what ?

06:58.031 --> 07:00.022
Her spinal cord was crushed, Mulder.

07:00.133 --> 07:03.830
The cervical vertebrae was fractured
in what appears to be manual trauma.

07:03.903 --> 07:05.803
Were Skinner's the only prints
lifted from the body ?

07:05.872 --> 07:09.569
So far.
They found no semen samples.

07:09.642 --> 07:13.339
There was some irritation,
probably an allergic reaction to latex.

07:13.413 --> 07:15.608
At least they were having safe sex.

07:15.682 --> 07:17.946
Have they learned anything more ?

07:18.017 --> 07:21.180
Yeah, her name was Carina Sayles.

07:21.254 --> 07:24.815
She was legal secretary for one of
the criminal defense firms here in town.

07:24.891 --> 07:27.951
- Have you talked
to anybody she worked with ?
- One of the partners.

07:28.027 --> 07:30.257
She was fired a few weeks ago
over an indiscretion.

07:30.330 --> 07:32.560
An indiscretion ?

07:32.665 --> 07:36.533
Yeah, she was moonlighting.
She was taking a little work
from one of the firm's clients.

07:36.603 --> 07:41.336
-What kind of work ?
-This client operated an escort service.

07:41.407 --> 07:43.341
She was a prostitute.

I, um--
I don't know what to say.

09:34.420 --> 09:36.752
You can start by telling us
if she was working last night.

09:36.856 --> 09:38.790
And if she was,
who paid for her company ?

09:38.858 --> 09:42.419
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- I guess that would hurt
future book sales, huh ?

09:42.528 --> 09:47.795
- You'd be surprised
who some of my clients are.
- No, I don't think I would be.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.927
I also doubt they'd want to get
entangled in a homicide investigation.

someone in a bar...

in a transaction.

- I took his credit card.

was he thinking ?

10:29.342 --> 10:31.833

10:31.911 --> 10:33.845
You think he'd be
a little more discrete.

10:33.913 --> 10:36.609
I think the lack of discretion
is the least of his sins.

10:36.683 --> 10:38.913
Still not enough
to prove anything conclusively.

10:38.985 --> 10:41.385
No, but that doesn't mean
that we can discount the evidence.

Look, Mulder, I feel the same way
about Skinner as you do,

that silence is strength.

16:21.394 --> 16:23.555
- what else is he capable of?
- Please.

16:23.629 --> 16:25.995
Give him the benefit
of the doubt.

16:26.065 --> 16:29.000
I am, Mulder, believe me.
I'm not trying to convince myself.

16:29.068 --> 16:32.504
When I mentioned that hooker to him,
he didn't even seem to know.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.974
Well, maybe he doesn't remember.

16:36.042 --> 16:38.135
What do you mean ?
Either he remembers, or he's a liar.

16:38.210 --> 16:40.235
Not necessarily.

16:43.015 --> 16:45.813
- This man’s running away from a train.
- [ Screaming ]

16:45.918 --> 16:49.285
He sees it coming straight at him.
He hears its whistle.

16:49.355 --> 16:54.054
Several times a month,
he ran away from that train...

16:54.126 --> 16:58.688
until one night when he broke his wife's
arm when he threw her to the foor.

16:58.764 --> 17:00.789
- Night terrors ?
- No.

17:00.866 --> 17:05.200
Night terrors and sleepwalking occur
during slow-wave non-dream sleep.

17:05.271 --> 17:08.502
The clinical term for this is
" REM sleep behavior disorder."

17:08.574 --> 17:12.567
Although rare, dozens of cases
of sleep-related violence
have been attributed to it.

17:12.645 --> 17:15.546
That's fascinating, but what does it
have to do with Skinner ?

17:15.614 --> 17:18.946
This videotape came from
the Bethesda Sleep Disorder Center...

17:19.050 --> 17:22.020
where Skinner has been receiving
treatment for the past three months.

17:22.121 --> 17:27.252
- From running away from trains ?
- Same disorder, different dreams.

17:27.326 --> 17:30.193
According to
Skinner's psychiatrist,

17:30.262 --> 17:34.961
he's been experiencing a recurring
dream in which he's confronted
by an old woman.

17:35.034 --> 17:37.002
She speaks to him,
but he doesn't understand a word.

17:37.069 --> 17:40.903
Sometimes she straddles
his chest, suffocating him.

17:40.973 --> 17:44.465
So you think that Skinner may have
killed the victim in his sleep ?

17:44.543 --> 17:47.637
Defending himself against
this imaginary old woman.

17:47.713 --> 17:51.672
A lot of these patients
have no recollection
of their nocturnal activities,

17:51.751 --> 17:53.685
which might explain
Skinner's amnesia.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.979
- That's not such a strange story.
- It isn't ?

17:57.089 --> 18:00.286
It's ancient, actually.
You may have heard it,

18:00.359 --> 18:03.453
although not in such
clinical terms.

18:03.529 --> 18:06.396
In the Middle Ages, a visitation
like the one Skinner described...

18:06.465 --> 18:10.094
would have been attributed
to succubus.

18:10.169 --> 18:14.105
It's a spirit
that visits men in the night,
usually in the form of an old woman.

18:14.173 --> 18:16.334
- Visits them for sex ?
- Usually.

18:16.409 --> 18:18.809
Although sometimes the succubus
becomes so attached to the man...

18:18.878 --> 18:22.439
that she would kill any woman
competing for his affection.

18:22.548 --> 18:24.311
Here.

18:28.254 --> 18:31.746
- What's that ?
- Reports of residual
and luminous phenomenon...

18:31.857 --> 18:34.189
have been associated
with some succubus encounters.

18:34.260 --> 18:36.490
At least according
to the mythology. Why ?

18:36.562 --> 18:38.792
I feel kinda strange saying
this, but I found something...

18:38.864 --> 18:42.265
during my postmortem examination
that I think you should see.

18:44.904 --> 18:47.805
It's a circular patch
around the victim's mouth and nose,

18:47.873 --> 18:50.842
approximately 11 centimeters
in diameter.

18:50.910 --> 18:55.108
It retained light energy.
It glowed in the dark.

19:06.859 --> 19:09.726
I know what I saw, Mulder.
It was here.

19:09.795 --> 19:12.787
This phosphorescence required
no U.V. or infrared light ?

19:12.865 --> 19:17.325
- No, it was definitely
visible to the naked eye.
- Did you get a sample ?

19:17.403 --> 19:20.600
- Yeah, I sent one over to Chem/Tox.
- And ?

19:20.673 --> 19:23.938
Well, my first hunch was that it was
that it was some kind of fungal growth,

19:24.009 --> 19:25.811
but the only substance
that they detected was amylase,
which is found in saliva.

19:25.811 --> 19:27.779
but the only substance
that they detected was amylase,
which is found in saliva.

19:27.880 --> 19:32.840
So I had them send over a sample
to the elemental analysis unit.

19:32.952 --> 19:35.614
The results should be back.

19:35.688 --> 19:39.146
Yes, this is Agent Dana Scully.
I'm calling to find out the lab
results on a tissue sample...

19:39.225 --> 19:43.594
that I sent in
earlier this morning.

19:43.662 --> 19:46.722
- Thank you.
- What'd they say ?

19:46.799 --> 19:50.235
That there was no analyzable substance
in the sample container.

19:50.302 --> 19:52.099
Are you sure
you saw something ?

19:52.171 --> 19:55.698
Mulder, I'm afraid this isn't exactly
something that I'd make up.

19:58.477 --> 20:01.537
Maybe that's it.

20:01.647 --> 20:05.583
Maybe that's why Skinner's running.
He's afraid.

20:05.651 --> 20:09.087
- That he did it ?
- That he doesn't know he didn't do it.

20:26.805 --> 20:28.739

20:37.583 --> 20:41.110
Hi.

20:41.186 --> 20:43.313
You didn't answer your phone.
It just kept ringing.

20:43.389 --> 20:46.381
I unplugged it.
I haven't been sleeping too well lately.

20:49.762 --> 20:53.027
Are you going to invite me in,
or should I start building an ark ?

20:54.934 --> 20:56.868
Come in.

21:04.743 --> 21:08.008
You still haven't gotten around
to unpacking.

21:08.113 --> 21:11.014
Yeah, well, you know, work.

21:12.818 --> 21:16.481
[ Sighing ]
So what are you doing here, Sharon ?

21:16.555 --> 21:19.991
I'm not sure.

21:20.059 --> 21:22.823
After I saw you today,
I didn't know what else to do.

21:22.895 --> 21:25.659
You're trying to satisfy some morbid
curiosity about what happened.

21:25.731 --> 21:29.565
That's not why I came. I just--
I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.

21:29.635 --> 21:31.569
I'm okay.

21:33.005 --> 21:35.166
Except right now, company's
about the last thing I need.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.765
I'm not company,
I'm your wife.

21:37.843 --> 21:39.811
Ex-wife. Remember, you're the one
who asked for the divorce ?

21:39.878 --> 21:43.746
Only because you didn't have the guts
to ask for one yourself,
so don't put it on me.

21:45.584 --> 21:47.518
Fair enough.

21:49.822 --> 21:51.847
So what else
do you want me to say ?

21:51.924 --> 21:53.858
Nothing.

21:55.427 --> 21:57.827
I don't want you to say anything.

22:01.667 --> 22:05.034
- I just want you to let me in.
just this one time.
- Why ?

22:05.104 --> 22:07.538
Because I know you.

22:09.274 --> 22:19.377
I know that you’re scared
and that you could use some comfort.

22:19.418 --> 22:21.648
I also know that you’ll never
let me give it to you.

- It's your wife--
she's been in an accident.
- Is she all right ?

23:58.317 --> 24:01.081

24:31.583 --> 24:34.984
- How is she ?
- The C.T. scan shows subdural hematoma.

24:35.053 --> 24:38.318
She's in surgery right now
to relieve pressure on her brain.

24:38.423 --> 24:40.357
Scully's trying to get
more information.

24:41.627 --> 24:44.596
- I have to see her.
- Can't do that, sir.

- Why not ? They said
I wasn't being charged.
- Not yet,

but they're building
a pretty convincing case.

- No, I don't, but I'm in the minority.

happening tome that I would try to--

25:44.122 --> 25:46.056
[ Sighing ]

25:46.124 --> 25:50.527
A few months ago,
I started... seeing her again.

25:50.596 --> 25:52.496
Again ?

26:00.806 --> 26:05.743
I told you once what--
what happened to me in Vietnam.

26:05.811 --> 26:07.870
I was caught in an ambush.

26:07.946 --> 26:10.414
Yeah, you were
the sole survivor.

26:10.482 --> 26:14.009
You also described what sounded
like a near-death experience.

26:14.086 --> 26:19.114
There was nothing near about it,
Agent Mulder. I was a dead man.

26:19.224 --> 26:21.624
That's when
you first saw her ?

26:21.693 --> 26:25.151
I saw lots of things over there.

26:25.264 --> 26:29.667
- I didn't give much credence
to any of'em.
- Why not ?

26:29.735 --> 26:32.397
[ Sighs ]

26:32.471 --> 26:37.431
I got through that experience
like most 1 8-year-olds.

26:37.509 --> 26:39.977
By numbing myself
with whatever was around.

26:40.045 --> 26:44.038
I was no choirboy.
I-- I inhaled.

26:45.450 --> 26:47.884
So you just dismissed her
as another hallucination ?

26:47.953 --> 26:51.116
- I tried.
- But you couldn't.

26:52.858 --> 26:55.793
She was there with me,

26:55.861 --> 26:58.091
watching me,

26:58.163 --> 27:03.226
as I was watching myself die
and my blood spilling from
a hundred different places...

27:05.304 --> 27:07.738
until she lifted me up
and carried me back,

27:09.808 --> 27:12.140
away from the light.

27:12.210 --> 27:15.304
Maybe she was trying
to protect you.

27:15.380 --> 27:17.507
Maybe she's trying
to protect you now.

27:19.518 --> 27:21.952
Protect me from what ?

27:24.723 --> 27:26.850
That's a question
only you can answer.

27:29.261 --> 27:31.161
I don't know.

27:33.432 --> 27:35.366
I don't have a clue.

27:43.809 --> 27:46.972
- Number five.
- This is Skinner's car ?

27:47.045 --> 27:50.412
According to Walter's report,
the hood was still warm when
they got to Skinner's apartment,

27:50.482 --> 27:53.315
even with the rain.

27:53.385 --> 27:56.354
Look at the left front panel.

27:56.455 --> 27:58.980
They match the paint in the dent
of Sharon Skinner's car.

27:59.091 --> 28:02.219
Waltos's people finish
going over the interior ?

28:02.327 --> 28:04.318
The only prints they found
on the steering wheel were Skinner's.

28:04.463 --> 28:07.762
- Can I borrow your flashlight ?
- Sure. Why ?

28:13.238 --> 28:15.900
I don't know what you’re
expecting to find, Mulder,

28:15.974 --> 28:19.705
but Skinner's hearing is
in half an hour.

28:19.778 --> 28:22.872
- I'll meet you there.
- What are you doing ?

28:22.948 --> 28:24.882
Collecting evidence.

28:28.387 --> 28:32.050
- You know how an air bag works ?
- Your car hits something,
a bag fills with air, you don't die.

28:32.157 --> 28:34.455
Not air.
Nitrogen.

28:34.526 --> 28:36.460
Now, the latent image,
the one we're interested in,

28:36.528 --> 28:38.860
is found in the byproduct
of that explosion...

28:38.930 --> 28:42.889
in the finely dispersed sodium metal
that coats the interior of the air bag.

28:42.968 --> 28:45.596
See this pattern here ?
It was created...

28:45.670 --> 28:47.968
by whoever was behind the wheel
when the airbag deployed.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.032
- It doesn't look like a face.
- Not yet.

28:51.109 --> 28:54.272
First, I'm scanning the pattern,
then I'm running it through software...

28:54.346 --> 28:58.874
which translates its varying densities
into a dimensionalized likeness.

28:58.950 --> 29:02.408
After that,
it's a matter of fine-tuning.

29:02.487 --> 29:05.979
- How long does that take ?
- You need this in a hurry,
it sounds like.

29:06.091 --> 29:09.288
I'm not the only one
who needs it.

29:32.651 --> 29:35.643
Let's go over
the physical evidence again.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.553
You say you found nothing damning.

29:38.623 --> 29:42.024
No, sir, none of the physical evidence
we recovered directly...

to her death.

29:45.063 --> 29:47.623
You reexamined the victim's body.

29:47.699 --> 29:50.167
Did you find anything of note ?

29:50.235 --> 29:54.535
I took a sample
of an extraneous substance
that turned out to be unidentifiable.

29:54.606 --> 29:56.938
How's that ?

29:57.008 --> 30:00.341
A naturally occurring enzyme
around her mouth and nose.

30:00.412 --> 30:04.280
- And do you have any idea
why it was there ?
- No.

30:04.349 --> 30:06.715
If you are withholding something
from this committee--

30:06.818 --> 30:11.346
Sir, I feel reluctant to say
or to speak for Agent Mulder.

30:11.456 --> 30:13.822
To say what ?

30:16.094 --> 30:21.191
Agent Mulder had a theory
that the substance could have
come from a visitation.

30:21.266 --> 30:24.861
But you have
another explanation.

30:24.936 --> 30:27.336
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

30:27.405 --> 30:30.897
Do you believe in paranormal
phenomena, Agent Scully ?

30:30.976 --> 30:33.809
Whatever extreme cases
I have encountered,

30:33.879 --> 30:36.404
I have always viewed
through the lens of science.

30:36.481 --> 30:39.746
I believe that is why I was assigned
to the X-Files and to Agent Mulder.

30:41.319 --> 30:46.086
And has A.D. Skinner always been
as discriminating as you ?

30:46.158 --> 30:48.353
Excuse me, sir,
I don't understand the question.

30:48.426 --> 30:51.259
Would you say that, like yourself,
your direct superior...

30:51.329 --> 30:55.993

Agent Mulder's notion--

30:56.067 --> 30:58.535
No, sir. Not at all.

And yet he continues
to sign off...

elect to investigate.

I believe the assistant director
has protected us out of a respect
for the work.

31:10.949 --> 31:13.679
just as you might protect him...

31:13.785 --> 31:17.016

unidentifiable evidence ?

31:17.122 --> 31:20.387
No, that is not true.

They used us to do it, didn't they ?
They used the X-Files.

32:05.637 --> 32:08.606
- How'd you know ?
- Because I think Skinner's
been outmaneuvered, Scully.

32:08.707 --> 32:11.267
- They found a weakness,
and they're exploiting it.
- Why ?

32:11.376 --> 32:14.345
To put us in check.
You remove Skinner, you weaken us.

32:14.412 --> 32:16.380
What am I looking at ?

32:16.448 --> 32:21.385
This is the man that stole Skinner's car
last night and tried to kill his wife.

32:21.453 --> 32:25.617
But I don't understand. Why orchestrate
an elaborate scheme to set him up ?

32:25.690 --> 32:27.715
- Why not just kill him ?
- They already tried that once.

32:27.792 --> 32:31.592
A second attempt would be too obvious,
even for these thugs.

32:31.663 --> 32:34.689
Anyway, I think Skinner's probably worth
more to them alive and disgraced...

32:34.766 --> 32:38.167
- than dead and buried.
- Who is this guy ?

32:38.236 --> 32:41.171
I don't know. Danny couldn't find
anything on him. He's still running it.

32:41.239 --> 32:42.672
So how are we supposed
to find him ?

32:42.741 --> 32:45.403
This guy's a pawn.
Pawns always make the first move.

32:45.477 --> 32:47.775
So he must've hired
the prostitute.

32:47.846 --> 32:49.780
[ Chattering ]

32:56.087 --> 32:59.887
- What happened ?
-Jumper. Happens whenever
it rains two days straight.

33:12.003 --> 33:14.938
[Mulder]
He got to her first.

33:18.143 --> 33:21.579
Mulder, look.

33:24.549 --> 33:27.848
Usually there'd be something
set up in the room...

33:27.919 --> 33:32.356
to get... pictures,
tape, whatever.

33:33.458 --> 33:36.552
Judy, we need you
to identify somebody.

33:36.628 --> 33:39.563
Is this the man
who hired Carina ?

33:43.101 --> 33:45.797
- He said that nobody would get hurt.
- He lied.

33:45.904 --> 33:48.031
Skinner's not
the only person he set up.

33:48.139 --> 33:50.630
Are you saying
he killed Carina ?

33:50.742 --> 33:53.643
And Lorraine.
He's cleaning house.

33:53.712 --> 33:56.408
We need you
to arrange a meeting.

33:56.481 --> 33:59.473
I can't. Lorraine's the only one
who ever really talked to him.

33:59.551 --> 34:02.247
Unfortunately, Lorraine
can't get to the phone right now.

34:03.421 --> 34:05.355
Please don't make me do this.

34:05.423 --> 34:09.792
Look what he did to your friends.
We’re your only chance
of coming out of this okay.

34:09.860 --> 34:12.159
You know, Mulder's right.

34:12.230 --> 34:15.630
I'll stay with you, if you want,
until we take him into custody.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.895
I want you to call him.

34:17.969 --> 34:21.996
Tell him you're scared
because we questioned you.

34:22.107 --> 34:24.735
Tell him you want money
to get out of town.

34:24.842 --> 34:26.936
You'll meet him
at the Ambassador Hotel bar.

34:27.011 --> 34:28.945
Okay ?

34:39.123 --> 34:44.824
Hello ? Hi.
This is Judy Fairly.

34:44.896 --> 34:47.262
You might not remember me,

34:47.331 --> 34:49.300
but I work for Lorraine.

34:49.367 --> 34:51.301
One moment, please.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.172
Yes ?

34:57.976 --> 35:01.503
Some F.B.I. agents came to see me
about what happened to Lorraine.

35:01.579 --> 35:04.343
- What did you tell them ?
- Nothing.

35:06.317 --> 35:08.251
I didn't say anything,

35:10.321 --> 35:12.516
but they scared
the hell out of me.

35:14.392 --> 35:18.453
Look, I need some money.

35:18.530 --> 35:20.828
That can be arranged.

35:20.899 --> 35:24.164
- Can you meet me ?
- Where would you like to meet ?

35:24.235 --> 35:26.897
The Ambassador Hotel at--

35:30.175 --> 35:32.109
In an hour ?

35:32.177 --> 35:35.908
I'm close.
I'll see you in an hour.

36:01.606 --> 36:05.372
I had to tell you, Sharon,
before anything else happens.

36:06.611 --> 36:09.045
I'm not signing those papers.

36:11.249 --> 36:15.879
For a lot of reasons,
most of them, I'm just...

36:15.954 --> 36:18.388
realizing myself
for the first time.

36:27.065 --> 36:29.499
Some of the things I've seen.

36:32.136 --> 36:36.470
The violence and the lies that I've
witnessed men inflict on one another.

36:36.541 --> 36:38.975
I can never tell you that.

36:41.613 --> 36:45.379
Not that I ever stopped
believing in the work,

36:45.450 --> 36:49.079
but there were contradictions
that I couldn't reconcile...

36:49.153 --> 36:53.089
which meant shutting down part
of myself just to do my job.

37:00.899 --> 37:03.834
I never told you
what I should've told you.

37:05.603 --> 37:07.537
[ Sighs ]

37:08.940 --> 37:11.568
That what really got me
through each day was...

37:11.676 --> 37:15.544
knowing that I'd be sleeping
next to you that night,

37:15.613 --> 37:19.549
knowing that I had a reason
to wake up in the morning.

37:32.063 --> 37:34.998
I'm not sure
if you can even hear me now...

37:37.602 --> 37:40.571
or if it even makes
a difference to you anymore,

37:45.510 --> 37:48.570
but I at least wanted you
to know that.

37:57.455 --> 37:59.980
[ Gasps ]

38:00.058 --> 38:02.151
- Sharon ?
-[Monitor Beeping]

38:08.900 --> 38:10.993
Somebody--

38:42.400 --> 38:44.868
Listen to me.

39:20.004 --> 39:23.167
- [ Ringing ]
- Did you get him ?

39:23.241 --> 39:25.300
No, he hasn't shown up yet.

39:25.376 --> 39:29.437
- He should have been here
1 5 minutes ago.
- What's going on ?

39:29.514 --> 39:31.846
Nothing.
[ Sighs ]

39:31.916 --> 39:35.113
- Great.
- Maybe it's the rain.

39:35.219 --> 39:38.279
This guy isn't about to let
a little rain stop him.

39:38.389 --> 39:42.553
-[Door Opening, Closing]
- Mulder, hang on a second.

39:42.627 --> 39:45.323
-Judy !
- Scully, what's going on ?

39:45.396 --> 39:48.297
Mulder, get up here right now.

39:48.366 --> 39:50.300
He's upstairs.

39:54.038 --> 39:56.632
Judy ?

39:56.708 --> 39:58.642
[Water Running]

40:17.228 --> 40:19.526
[ Gasping ]
What the hell are you doing ?

40:19.597 --> 40:22.327
I'm sorry. I called,
but you didn't answer.

40:25.269 --> 40:27.328
What's the matter ?
[ Groaning ]

40:32.610 --> 40:36.205
[Gunshots]

40:56.400 --> 40:58.334
[ Crying ]

41:03.741 --> 41:06.335
- You okay ?
- [ Groans ]

41:27.365 --> 41:30.266
- Sir ?
- Come in.

41:30.334 --> 41:32.268
This is our report.
[ Sighs ]

41:32.336 --> 41:36.204
You'll see, though, that
several questions remain unanswered.

41:36.274 --> 41:38.208
The identity
of the man I shot ?

41:38.276 --> 41:41.609
We ran his face and fingerprints
through every available database.

41:41.679 --> 41:44.978
There's still no matches,
and we're doing a dental record search,

41:45.049 --> 41:48.712
but that'll probably be
a dead end too.

41:48.820 --> 41:53.257
And regarding the other man,
the telephone number we had
for him has been disconnected,

41:53.357 --> 41:56.087
and there's no record
of an account.

41:56.160 --> 42:00.187
Don't waste your time, Agent Scully.
You won't find him.

42:00.264 --> 42:04.132
just get whatever forensic evidence you
need off the body you have and bury it.

42:09.607 --> 42:11.666
- Is there a problem, Agent Mulder ?
- Yeah,

42:11.742 --> 42:14.142
there's something else
you'll find missing in there.

42:14.212 --> 42:18.342
An explanation for how you knew
to beat the hotel last night.

42:20.551 --> 42:23.247
I was hoping you could fill in
that line item yourself.

42:25.857 --> 42:28.724
I'm afraid I can't do that,
at least not at this point in time.

42:28.793 --> 42:31.694
Why not ?

42:31.762 --> 42:35.892
Because whatever I believed
may have happened,

42:35.967 --> 42:38.094
that has no place
on an official report.

42:38.169 --> 42:41.605
Then why don’t you
just tell me.

42:41.672 --> 42:43.606
Off the record.

42:53.918 --> 42:56.546
If you’ll excuse me,
I have some catching up to do.

42:56.654 --> 42:59.088
The O.P.C. did a number
on my office.

43:01.893 --> 43:04.259
But I wanna thank you for
the quick turnaround on this.
