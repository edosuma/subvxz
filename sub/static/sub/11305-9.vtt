WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.203
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:03.980
Wynonna and Officer Haught.
They've been taken.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.290
What do you mean, taken?

00:05.464 --> 00:07.626
There's something very wrong
deep inside of you.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.085
What was the last thing you saw?

00:09.259 --> 00:11.171
Waverly smiling at me
from her front porch.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.678
You want my help?
You two need to earn it.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.180
What happened to your shoulder?

00:16.350 --> 00:20.060
Revenants are human.
My boys are something more.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.516
No!

00:22.689 --> 00:24.681
- Somebody lost their head.
- Who are you?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.315
I'm the last of the Seven.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.477
You're just like me.
You're broken.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.862
So what now?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:46.129 --> 00:49.463
The thing about an Earp,
they are survivors to the core.

00:49.633 --> 00:54.094
Quick to recover, tenacious,
committed to their cause.

00:54.263 --> 00:58.473
Hey! Hey, stranger guy!

01:02.020 --> 01:05.184
The thing about this Earp
is she is all these things

01:05.357 --> 01:07.644
with demons for miles.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.861
I'm free. I'm free. I'm good.

01:12.030 --> 01:15.819
She is also a distraction
I cannot afford right now,

01:15.993 --> 01:19.327
given there is a witch
that needs to get dead.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.828
Kyle...

01:20.998 --> 01:23.832
- It's Pete.
- Let me make it up to you.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.632
But what are friends for

01:33.802 --> 01:36.215
if not to lend a rescuing hand
maybe once in a while?

01:36.388 --> 01:38.004
- Come on, just one more kiss.
- Don't!

01:38.181 --> 01:42.846
- Back all the way up, friend.
- This is none of your business.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.980
She ain't anybody's but her own.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.189
Are you alright?

01:56.366 --> 01:57.857
I'm gonna be sick.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.532
I thought I'd feel different.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.168
I thought I'd look different.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.751
You near perished
at the hands of a maniac.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.415
I'm not talking about that.

02:14.593 --> 02:17.256
The seven murderous spawns of hell

02:17.429 --> 02:19.967
that attacked the homestead
and killed Willa are dead.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.678
Well, you said you'd get them,
and you got 'em.

02:24.936 --> 02:28.805
But this spring,
coiled so tight in me,

02:28.982 --> 02:31.190
it's just as tight, Doc.

02:33.028 --> 02:36.192
From my experience,
and I've got some...

02:37.240 --> 02:38.947
you release the rage,

02:39.117 --> 02:41.325
you might find
there's nothing left.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.991
Worst fortune-cookie
advice ever.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.122
I hate this stupid curse.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.211
What did Wyatt do
to mess us all up so bad?

02:52.381 --> 02:54.338
He always aimed
to be a good man.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.374
It might be it didn't take.

02:56.551 --> 03:00.170
In the end, it's men like me
who often survive.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.556
Then maybe
it's better to be bad.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.894
Ohhh, shit!

03:12.067 --> 03:13.808
I'm bored outta my tits.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.773
Why the hell they need 20 of us
to guard them witch's bones?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.904
Yeah, what's she gonna do?
Cast a scaredy spell?

03:19.074 --> 03:20.986
Or a love potion.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.742
Hey, maybe she got a magic wand

03:23.912 --> 03:26.575
that'll make Taylor Swifty
wanna get all up in my pants.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.668
Oh, I've got a wand.

03:32.838 --> 03:36.297
But it'll more likely
make you shit your pants.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.386
Mommy's back, boys.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.672
Whoa! Wow!

04:26.850 --> 04:29.467
This is not what I expected
the cat to drag in.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.136
You're not the only one
who gets to be married to his job.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.394
Married? Slow down.
At best, it's just my girlfriend.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.016
For the first time in ages

04:37.194 --> 04:40.232
I woke up and knew
exactly what I needed to do.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.146
What? Wear tighter pants?

04:42.324 --> 04:44.532
I nailed the Seven, Dolls.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.569
I can just get the next seven,
and the seven after that,

04:47.746 --> 04:50.534
and one day they'll all be dead
and we can party in CancÃºn.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.824
With what?
'Cause word from Shorty's

04:53.001 --> 04:55.163
is that you drank the world dry
of tequila last night.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.999
You can try, but I dare you

04:57.172 --> 04:59.585
to cockblock the drive
I woke up with this morning, OK?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.542
What?

05:02.719 --> 05:05.587
- A brain peeler?
- Psychological assessment.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.177
I was assessed plenty
when I was a crazy teenager

05:08.350 --> 05:09.716
who "dreamed up demons".

05:09.893 --> 05:11.733
Yeah, well, head office,
they insist on it, OK?

05:11.895 --> 05:13.932
Well, tell head office
to suck it.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.391
You tell them.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.727
There's an analyst waiting
in the interview room.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.779
Are you having trouble sleeping?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.690
I'll sleep when I'm dead.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.575
- Concentrating?
- Hmm?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.862
Kidding. No. No trouble.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.157
Do you have an exaggerated
startle response?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.246
Only to shirtless men
with man-boobs.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.785
Stay on course, Earp.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.875
Have you ever mistaken
a human for a demon?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.005
Never.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.168
Do you have disturbing and
repeated thoughts or flashbacks

05:45.345 --> 05:47.257
of your abduction
and near-death experience?

05:47.430 --> 05:50.218
Nope.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.673
Do you have disturbing and
repeated thoughts or flashbacks

05:52.769 --> 05:54.977
of killing supernatural creatures?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.762
No.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.432
Do you have disturbing and
repeated thoughts or flashbacks

05:59.609 --> 06:00.941
of killing your father?

06:01.111 --> 06:03.319
Why's she going off book?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.775
Sometimes. I guess.

06:05.949 --> 06:09.067
When was the last time
you had sexual intercourse?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.029
I don't know what
that has to do with anything.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.538
The bomb in the Bleaker case

06:14.708 --> 06:16.040
was traced back to a young woman

06:16.209 --> 06:17.791
who ran briefly
with the Bandidos.

06:17.961 --> 06:21.204
You ran with the Bandidos.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.168
Two people died.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.923
Is there a question in there?

06:25.093 --> 06:28.336
Would you consider yourself
a murderer, Wynonna?

06:30.974 --> 06:32.966
All you did was watch.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.635
I couldn't burst in. It would've
made you look even worse.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.372
You're supposed to be
my goddamn friend.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.812
Yeah, I'm your boss.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.224
- You know what I mean.
- We need to be careful, alright?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.893
You're not even
a real deputy, Earp. Come on.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.936
No, I'm just the one
with the big-ass gun

06:46.114 --> 06:48.276
who sends the fiends of hell
to their deaths.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.908
Technically, it's not the gun
that kills them, it's...

06:51.077 --> 06:52.534
Oh, my God!

06:53.622 --> 06:55.158
You stupid government lackey.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.039
You left me in there

06:57.208 --> 06:59.328
with a bureaucratic sadist
and I was alone and scared.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.789
- You're not alone, Earp.
- Or a murderer.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.829
OK.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.294
Just once, I want you to say it.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.926
That you care about me.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.304
Pussy.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.766
Earp.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.185
You failed the assessment.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.272
You're suspended
until further notice.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.782
Badge.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.201
Perfect.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.408
Have fun with your girlfriend.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.701
It's quite generous,

07:41.878 --> 07:44.245
considering the condition
of the building.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.794
I'm seeing some fine print here.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.550
- The usual, Waves.
- Oh.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.302
- Pete?
- The usual, please.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.509
That states
the buyer's intentions,

07:54.683 --> 07:56.015
which could include anything

07:56.184 --> 07:57.516
from rebuilding
or remodelling...

07:57.686 --> 07:59.177
They want to tear it down?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.346
There you go.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.484
I heard about you and Champ,
by the way.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.191
He never treated you right, Waverly.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.071
I was thinking, you know,

08:11.241 --> 08:13.358
any man in Purgatory
would be lucky to have you.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.026
And I was also thinking...

08:15.203 --> 08:18.196
That you should find a gal
like me, only taller, right?

08:18.373 --> 08:19.864
So she can actually get up

08:20.041 --> 08:22.704
in that custom-lifted
tricked-out pick-up of yours.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.086
- Yeah, exactly.
- Move.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.373
Ooh! Someone woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.166
Why do I even get out of bed?

08:30.343 --> 08:33.131
A bed that I have every right
to screw whoever I want in.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.386
Don't even.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.048
"Have fun with your girlfriend"?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.808
What kind of stupid
exit line was that?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.844
Move!

08:45.567 --> 08:46.899
Who's that?

08:47.068 --> 08:49.526
Gus is getting an offer
to buy the bar.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.938
I know! She can't do that,
can she, Wyn?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.755
I mean, she wouldn't, right?
She couldn't.

08:53.825 --> 08:54.825
She won't.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.737
If that asshat's
a real-estate broker,

08:59.914 --> 09:01.780
then I'm an oil baron's
labradoodle.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.997
No-one's taking the bar.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.254
No-one is ever taking
anything from us again.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.840
Turn around, shit brick.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.014
Please, don't.
I can give you money.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.680
You want to get to me?
You don't go through my family.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.223
I don't even know you.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.235
It doesn't matter
how many of you come after me.

09:31.404 --> 09:36.695
I will put you down,
whether you make your peace or not.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.446
Show me your brand.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.208
Sorry, I thought you were
something... someone else.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.425
You're crazy.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.717
That's all the bones
we have, boys.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.806
And I'm afraid
the one with the head wins.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.062
I'm sorry, my love.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.691
You will live in your brother.
One is better than none.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.549
No matter how you bring
a child into this world,

10:39.722 --> 10:41.634
it sucks the life out of you.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.642
Drek.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.901
Your face...

11:03.079 --> 11:05.412
- Who...
- I'm your...

11:05.582 --> 11:07.039
mother.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.367
Mama.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.585
Brother.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.718
It wasn't my fault.
A bad man made me do it.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.254
I had to choose.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.299
- We will kill this man.
- No!

11:24.475 --> 11:26.512
I lost you once.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.018
I won't have that happen again.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.225
- Stop!
- I'm sorry.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.391
Your skin is young,
but it will toughen.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.693
My magic is spent, but as soon
as we cross the boundary,

11:40.867 --> 11:42.904
I will fix this, baby,
I promise.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.160
OK, there isn't much time.
We have to go.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.787
Come.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.203
I need you to be my big boy.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.288
Drek!

11:53.296 --> 11:55.629
Shh.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.414
Shh.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.584
A new world awaits us.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.469
And out there...

12:03.765 --> 12:06.132
we will be gods.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.839
Then I tossed my badge and said,
"Have fun with your girlfriend."

12:11.022 --> 12:13.105
'Cause he loves work so much.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.765
But it didn't really land,
you know?

12:14.943 --> 12:17.606
I do not. Lord, girl,
you need to blow off that steam.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.697
This mind-screw of a bastard's
calling me a murderer,

12:21.866 --> 12:25.200
and the whole time
Dolls is just... just watching,

12:25.370 --> 12:27.282
when he could've been... been...

12:27.455 --> 12:28.946
Rescuing you?

12:29.123 --> 12:31.957
My dear, I believe.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.119
Dolls abandoned
that white stallion years ago.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.003
I don't need a knight
in shining armour.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.711
I just... I need to know
he's got my back.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.671
I've learned a thing or two
about Dolls,

12:41.844 --> 12:43.506
and I'll tell you this -

12:43.680 --> 12:45.137
he is a hypocrite at best,

12:45.306 --> 12:48.094
and a malicious manufacturer
of falsehoods at worst.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.682
Wynonna, you are shaking
like a leaf.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.015
I almost killed a guy today.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.935
A real live, red-blooded human.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.776
It was an honest case
of mistaken identity.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.736
Sadly, in your current profession,

13:04.909 --> 13:07.868
it is difficult for you to tell
a revenant from one that is not.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.619
It was more than that.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.956
I wanted to kill something, Doc.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.497
I wanted to stare down
the barrel of 'Peacemaker'

13:16.671 --> 13:17.957
and just shoot.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.631
Jesus, listen to me.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.921
Maybe I am crazy.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.052
You just got the itch.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.214
It is a thing
rarely articulated,

13:29.392 --> 13:32.556
but there is a power
in taking the life of someone else,

13:32.729 --> 13:35.437
and it is unequalled
by anything else in this world.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.563
It is a dangerous drug.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.686
I guess I'd rather
chase the dragon

13:41.863 --> 13:43.195
than be a pathetic victim.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.276
Oh, you were never that.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.528
- What am I?
- Well, you're Wynonna Earp.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.832
Now, I am not sure
this is the best idea.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.003
You're the one who told me
I should blow off steam.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.422
My vast wisdom is a burden.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.808
Oh!

14:20.985 --> 14:22.817
Is it bad?

14:22.987 --> 14:26.401
Well, considering the bullet
went through Clootie and not me,

14:26.574 --> 14:28.531
I guess not.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.567
When she gave you
almost-immortality,

14:30.745 --> 14:32.031
you became joined.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.696
By unnatural forces.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.241
Oh, there are natural forces
at work here.

14:39.629 --> 14:44.920
And right now, I am
far more interested in them.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.428
"Unnatural." "Otherworldly."

14:50.598 --> 14:52.760
"Potential Jack The Ripper."
Really?

14:52.934 --> 14:55.301
Nicole, I like a joke
as much as the next guy,

14:55.478 --> 14:56.810
but I don't have time for this.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.471
Look, it wasn't easy
to write any of that down,

14:59.649 --> 15:01.060
but it is what I experienced.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.770
I swear.

15:02.944 --> 15:06.233
Look, I know you've had
a hell of a time.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.398
You want to take a day or two,
I understand.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.112
This isn't about getting kidnapped.
It's not just that.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.151
I mean, Sheriff, come on,
you gotta admit...

15:13.329 --> 15:14.695
this place is weird.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.455
It's a small town, Nicole.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.911
It's quirky.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.498
It's called Purgatory,
for Chrissake.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.045
Look...

15:25.508 --> 15:27.340
if you think
it's anything more than that,

15:27.510 --> 15:29.797
you might as well put in
your resignation.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.587
I don't want to resign.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.050
I like it here.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.840
Good.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.927
I'll redo the report.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.475
Door.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.080
Whoa! Whoa!

16:03.254 --> 16:04.586
Where's the hold-up?

16:04.755 --> 16:06.291
'Cause you're a cop.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.874
Right. Sorry.

16:09.051 --> 16:12.010
- Um, can we talk?
- Y-yeah. Yeah.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.012
God, we're totally overdue.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.300
OK, I'm not...
I'm not crazy, right?

16:17.477 --> 16:18.843
There's something going on here.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.307
- No. You're not crazy.
- OK.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.143
I'm not sure
I'm really ready to...

16:23.316 --> 16:25.558
Pfoof!..get into it.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.855
Why?

16:28.029 --> 16:29.895
Because it's different
for me, right?

16:30.072 --> 16:32.860
And, you know, it's...
it's really personal.

16:33.034 --> 16:36.402
Er, but it's personal
for everybody, right?

16:36.579 --> 16:38.286
I mean, they must know.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.288
People must whisper about it.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.824
My God, I hope not!

16:42.001 --> 16:43.458
No, I...

16:43.628 --> 16:45.620
I kind of only just discovered it.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.788
When I met you.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.456
Me?

16:49.634 --> 16:51.546
- Yeah.
- Er...

16:51.719 --> 16:53.551
You're kind of special.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.883
OK, uh...

16:56.057 --> 16:57.764
maybe a little bit
more open-minded,

16:57.934 --> 17:00.267
but it's not like I have
some mystical gift or something.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.304
No, I get it. You're a lesbian,
not a unicorn, right?

17:03.481 --> 17:05.063
- What?
- What?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.520
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.400
Sorry, don't you want to talk?

17:09.569 --> 17:11.185
I want the truth.

17:14.075 --> 17:18.115
I think I'd do better
with a unicorn.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.669
Shit.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.222
No way but out.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.738
Stay in the car, baby.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.577
Look at you all.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.707
Roadkill without
the 'killed' part.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.291
Constance, you put holes
in a few of my boys here.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.878
Tell me about it.
They really messed up my shoes.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.419
Yet Peeper here
has done you a solid.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.476
Now, I don't know
the legal term -

18:28.649 --> 18:31.983
you might - but I believe
it's somewhere in the vicinity

18:32.153 --> 18:35.146
of 'reckless abandonment'.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.691
Bad mommy.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.196
Peeper.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.659
You don't want to do that.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.550
Holy shit.

18:59.930 --> 19:04.470
Baby, I told you
to stay in the car.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.601
I see he's got
his father's looks.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.809
I'm done with this place.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.190
- That wasn't the deal.
- You lied to me, Bobo.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.273
- There's still time.
- Not for me.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.939
Then give me the lead.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.027
Out of all the chances
I have given you,

19:24.205 --> 19:26.788
you have one chance left.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.996
What are you gonna do with it?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.506
- I don't have it.
- What?

19:36.676 --> 19:41.796
All I know is, it's still
somewhere in the Triangle.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.604
Muzzle that thing now!

19:51.774 --> 19:53.060
I can't.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.692
You told me the skeletons
were almost complete.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.854
- So we're even.
- Oh, we will be.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.694
Give me that thing.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.617
Move it.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.198
Bobo...

20:10.501 --> 20:12.458
I begged you.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.802
No!

20:23.597 --> 20:26.556
No!

20:39.905 --> 20:42.443
What is it? Are you in pain?

20:42.616 --> 20:44.027
And it's beautiful.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.362
The witch.

20:45.536 --> 20:49.120
I can feel her, and she has
never been in such agony.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.078
- What can I do?
- You can help me.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.210
If I can feel her,
I can find her.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.543
And then I can kill her.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.592
Whatever's got their claw
in her...

21:06.766 --> 21:09.759
Could be waiting
to get their claws in us.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.615
Got to think clearly.
This could be a trap.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.354
Trap or no trap,
she will die at my hands today.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.560
If you kill her, you'll die too.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.396
Doc, you're not
really planning to...

21:18.569 --> 21:20.276
Wynonna, my plan
is the same as it was

21:20.446 --> 21:22.028
the day I crawled out
of that well.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.360
It is a simple plan.
It is an exceptional plan.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.445
Kill the witch.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.490
I won't let you.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.579
OK.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.126
I have a plan.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.462
And we will get the Stone Witch,
I promise, but...

21:44.595 --> 21:45.426
Doc?

21:45.596 --> 21:47.633
Shit!

21:50.059 --> 21:51.659
You've been fighting
with that coffee pot

21:51.811 --> 21:53.552
for 20 minutes and losing.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.312
- Come.
- That's my mug, Nedley.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.020
Nedley, that's my mug!

22:00.903 --> 22:02.360
Close the door. Sit down.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.105
Or not.

22:07.535 --> 22:08.867
- Nedley...
- Randy.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.244
You drink my hooch,
you call me Randy.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.949
Xavier.

22:13.123 --> 22:16.082
Oh, well, we'll just stick
to what we know, then.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.586
You ever notice that we get
some pretty high winds

22:19.755 --> 22:21.417
here in Purgatory?

22:22.508 --> 22:25.000
You ever notice that weathervane
in the town square,

22:25.177 --> 22:26.918
it always points west?

22:31.392 --> 22:33.224
Took it down, oiled it myself.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.306
Works fine, any direction.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.096
But a high wind comes up,
always points west.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.793
Look, if you're leading
up to something,

22:39.817 --> 22:41.274
now's a good time to get there.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.811
Well, any given day, Purgatory
is like an ER on a full moon.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.605
But you know that,

22:46.782 --> 22:49.274
because I think you came here
to investigate the paranormal.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.408
Don't deny it.
Guessed it a while back.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.286
Decided to keep it under my hat.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.367
Smart man.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.204
And why don't you keep it there?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.537
Look, whatever's going on
in this county

23:01.714 --> 23:03.114
nearly got
our only deputies killed,

23:03.215 --> 23:05.298
and I don't know about you,
but if I lose mine,

23:05.467 --> 23:08.255
I gotta go deputise
some fool like Champ Hardy.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.764
Yeah, that would be
a scary day in Purgatory, huh?

23:14.518 --> 23:17.101
- What's all that?
- A little on the trailer park.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.354
A little on Bobo Del Rey's
enterprises.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.560
I've been keeping
my eyes and ears open.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.066
He's got powerful friends
in town.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.851
I happen to know a few of them.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.356
You know what I do
is classified.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.525
But if you have
any information...

23:31.702 --> 23:33.944
Underneath the multiple layers
of asshole,

23:34.121 --> 23:37.034
you seem like a good man,
I know that.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.290
Then sometimes
you're gonna have to trust me.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.669
I do that, maybe we can start
working together.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.004
Case-by-case basis.

23:45.174 --> 23:47.336
Definitely maybe.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.469
Happy hour's starting.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.052
You want to wander
over to Shorty's with me?

23:54.224 --> 23:56.557
- I don't drink...
- At 4 o'clock. I know.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.764
Neither do I.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.600
But, you know, sometimes
learning things

24:00.773 --> 24:02.105
is just a matter of blending in.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.812
Come on there, Xavier.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.693
Time you became
one of the people.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.692
Waverly, what are you doing?

24:13.869 --> 24:17.158
Being alone. I want to be alone.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.243
Alright, well, you've reached
the edge of town,

24:19.416 --> 24:21.829
so any further out
and you're gonna freeze to death.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.086
- Just get in the car.
- No, thank you.

24:25.255 --> 24:28.089
I've got a Taser.
Don't you make me use it.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.886
OK, so I'll start.

24:34.056 --> 24:36.799
I'm sorry for being
such an asshole before.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.138
First you want to talk,
then you don't want to talk,

24:39.311 --> 24:40.597
then you tell me to talk...

24:40.771 --> 24:43.013
OK, well, maybe
we should figure out

24:43.190 --> 24:44.726
what exactly it is
we're talking about.

24:44.900 --> 24:48.359
Gus is selling Shorty's.
She acts like she won't, but she is.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.145
And everything is changing
around me,

24:50.322 --> 24:51.688
but it's all too fast, you know,

24:51.865 --> 24:54.778
and it's like nobody ever asks me
if I'm OK with it.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.739
It's like, could everybody
just stand still

24:56.912 --> 24:58.869
for one frickin' minute?!

25:00.624 --> 25:02.115
Hey...

25:03.168 --> 25:05.080
It's gonna be OK.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.498
I just screamed at you.
You shouldn't be nice to me.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.258
You know, I think you've just

25:12.428 --> 25:13.839
been dating too many shitheads.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.424
We're not dating.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.429
I know.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.181
God, Waverly,

25:19.351 --> 25:21.263
I would never ask you
to be someone you're not.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.429
Good. Just don't ask me
to be anyone at all.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.187
- Fine.
- Fine.

25:29.445 --> 25:32.153
Well, maybe just friends.

25:35.117 --> 25:38.610
Yeah, sure, Waverly.
Whatever you want.

25:44.293 --> 25:47.127
Constance Clootie.

25:47.296 --> 25:51.210
What kind of a mess
have you got yourself into now?

25:52.217 --> 25:53.958
Help me.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.342
Get me across the line
and I will...

25:58.515 --> 26:00.507
I'll give you anything you want.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.846
Power. Riches.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.182
A girl. Any girl.

26:05.355 --> 26:08.063
Step into a new life with me.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.441
She's an old-school
temptress, ain't she?

26:10.611 --> 26:13.274
Or just another washed-up whore.

26:13.447 --> 26:16.690
- You lured me, you sow.
- No! No!

26:16.867 --> 26:18.449
He's tricking you!

26:18.619 --> 26:22.238
Holliday, you never disappoint.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.499
I was gonna leave her

26:26.668 --> 26:29.001
and her smouldering spawn here,

26:29.171 --> 26:32.164
but then I saw her pain
speak to you

26:32.341 --> 26:35.334
and, well, I'm just a sucker
for a reunion.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.846
- Well, me too.
- No.

26:41.934 --> 26:45.473
- You're just a sucker.
- Says the unarmed revenant.

26:45.646 --> 26:48.639
In a coat Lady Gaga deemed
'maybe too much'.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.729
Wynonna, girl,
you're not as cut open

26:51.902 --> 26:53.609
as I thought you'd be,

26:53.779 --> 26:57.398
given your... dance with Jack.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.657
No more speeches.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.244
Just you, me and a gun.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.534
Make your peace.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.120
You cock that Buntline,
and I will blow it

27:08.293 --> 27:12.082
out of your lily white hand
faster than a fly can blink.

27:15.092 --> 27:18.961
If you shoot,
this all goes to shit.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.426
Dolls and Nedley are in the hills
with a sniper rifle.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.810
Your poker face is pitiful.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.688
Now put that gun
back in your pants.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.402
Well, someone's gun's
already been down there.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.188
Lovers' quarrel?

27:39.199 --> 27:42.658
Weapons away, boys.
There's a... lady present.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.361
You too, Doc.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.165
Bobo Del Rey.

27:52.337 --> 27:56.547
Now, did you or did you not vow
to deliver me the witch?

27:56.717 --> 27:58.549
That was before you betrayed me.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.085
Oh, now, now.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.174
You have made similar assurances

28:02.347 --> 28:05.761
to individuals here
who have done much worse.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.143
You've made promises of glory.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.225
Promises of escape.

28:11.398 --> 28:15.984
Now, if you were to renege
on one gentleman's agreement,

28:16.153 --> 28:18.691
well, who is to believe

28:18.864 --> 28:22.403
that you would guarantee
fulfilment of another?

28:26.371 --> 28:28.078
It ain't that simple.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.955
Oh, but it was,

28:30.125 --> 28:33.414
in the time from which
we all hail from.

28:33.587 --> 28:37.706
When a man's word
was all that he had.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.765
Alright.

28:51.939 --> 28:54.602
I may have played
with her a little.

28:54.775 --> 28:57.233
Broken her, uh, spirit.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.394
But she's all yours, Doc.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.862
As pledged.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.405
Now, you see, that proves
I keep my promises.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.945
Well, then, I am satisfied.

29:09.122 --> 29:12.786
So long as my women and I
have safe passage.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.460
Go.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.422
- "Your women"?
- Shut up, Wynonna.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.177
And keep movin'.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.889
Round 'er up, boys.

29:33.063 --> 29:36.602
Well, I hate to gift and run,
but I got another deal pending.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.483
As for her,
screw her, torture her.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.019
She's a screamer either way.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.654
And, Wynonna Earp,

29:43.824 --> 29:46.612
I have a very special surprise
for you.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.334
- Hey.
- Thank you much.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.377
Need anything else,
let me know, OK?

30:08.849 --> 30:10.260
Now what?

30:10.434 --> 30:13.552
Now we drink coffee. Observe.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.311
Socialise.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.062
Jerry, how you doin'?

30:21.695 --> 30:24.688
So you just did it?
You just went ahead and sold it.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.356
Decisions had to be made.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.946
I know you don't believe me,
but you were not born

30:29.119 --> 30:30.576
to be a goddamn
small-town waitress.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.783
Yeah, I believe you,
but I have, like, three shirts

30:32.956 --> 30:34.572
that say Shorty's.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.082
Honey, it's in the agreement.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.083
Shorty's will never
get torn down.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.415
You can work here
in as many shirts as you want

30:40.589 --> 30:41.875
for as long as you want.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.381
That's not the point...

30:43.550 --> 30:45.337
But when you decide you're ready

30:45.510 --> 30:47.877
to unstick those wings
of yours...

30:51.224 --> 30:52.806
Don't cash it for a week or so.

30:52.976 --> 30:56.060
- What's this?
- It's freedom, honey.

30:56.229 --> 30:59.222
You've been doing what others
want you to do for so long.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.357
Now you can do
whatever it is you want.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.735
Which is what?

31:04.905 --> 31:06.862
Live your life.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.445
Remember, some of
the best things in life

31:09.618 --> 31:11.985
are the surprises it throws us.

31:12.162 --> 31:15.155
About what we want.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.119
Who we want.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.743
You've always been
an honest kid.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.708
Don't stop now, hm?

31:32.849 --> 31:34.715
Hey.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.930
I got a message
for Wynonna Earp.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.141
She's not here.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.725
I can wait.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.783
Doc...

32:02.003 --> 32:04.711
- Sorry, no speak evil.
- I wasn't talking to you.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.294
Then who were you talking...
Shit!

32:20.897 --> 32:22.809
Honey,

32:22.983 --> 32:25.521
you don't bring table salt
to a witch fight.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.858
- What is that?
- A gift from the Blacksmith.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.905
Gallows silk.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.613
Soaked in the blood
of this pitiful creature,

32:34.786 --> 32:37.028
rendering her power futile.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.822
- Nooo!
- Three months.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.584
130 years.

32:43.753 --> 32:47.497
Retribution does not come quick,
but it will be glorious.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.586
I had a clean shot at Bobo.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.593
You would have been dead
before you pulled the trigger.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.049
Bobo and I had a deal.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.510
Who won't you make
a deal with, huh?

32:57.684 --> 32:59.471
First a witch,
then the devil himself.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.394
You're nothing like...

33:04.566 --> 33:07.274
- You're just nothing.
- You can judge me all you want.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.731
What do I care
for some broken woman's

33:09.905 --> 33:11.771
evaluation of my character?

33:14.743 --> 33:18.111
Look at all this history
repeating itself.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.408
How many Earps
can you fail in one lifetime?

33:23.585 --> 33:25.121
Talk all you want.

33:25.295 --> 33:27.708
They're your last words anyway.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.668
I know why you were cursed,
and how.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.800
I'll tell you
if you keep me alive.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.552
- She's lying.
- Could be.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.386
Or could be I'm about
to make a deal.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.178
She's stallin'.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.145
Don't you want to know this too?

33:49.528 --> 33:51.064
Tell me about the Earp curse.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.525
The details are hazy,

33:53.698 --> 33:55.940
as that was my demon husband.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.825
Revenge for the death
of our boys.

33:58.995 --> 34:03.160
Direct and manly
and, quite frankly, boring.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.995
Not the first word I'd use.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.080
Us girls like to take
vindictiveness

34:07.254 --> 34:09.041
to the next level,
don't we, Wynonna?

34:09.214 --> 34:12.331
And I wanted my own revenge
on Wyatt,

34:12.509 --> 34:15.297
so I went after
what Wyatt loved most.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.757
His best friend.

34:17.931 --> 34:19.672
You're a liar.

34:19.849 --> 34:23.967
I threw out a few juicy morsels
like 'health' and 'longevity'...

34:24.145 --> 34:27.228
and you were mine.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.935
You tricked me.

34:29.109 --> 34:30.869
When Wyatt found you buried
in a whore's muff

34:30.985 --> 34:32.272
instead of underground,

34:32.445 --> 34:34.607
when he learned of our deal,

34:34.781 --> 34:36.989
his heart broke in two.

34:38.702 --> 34:42.446
Then I threw you down a well,
so that even if Wyatt softened,

34:42.621 --> 34:44.864
came looking for you...

34:45.875 --> 34:47.456
Did he?

34:47.627 --> 34:50.960
And you got to spend decades
in the dark,

34:51.130 --> 34:54.465
knowing your best friend
despised you.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.626
John Henry.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.795
This whole time,
you thought it was personal,

34:58.972 --> 35:02.716
but it's always been
about the alpha dog.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.972
You shut your lyin' mouth.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.763
You're a good sidekick,
dear Doc,

35:08.940 --> 35:10.932
but you'll never be a hero.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.817
A perpetual second choice.

35:13.987 --> 35:17.401
But in the end,
everyone chooses the lawman.

35:17.574 --> 35:20.738
- Everyone.
- I'm gonna kill you.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.742
You gave me your word
he wouldn't.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.574
If you kill her,
you kill yourself.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.832
Then you'll be the last person
I disappoint.

35:28.001 --> 35:30.664
But this inhuman creature
must be made to pay.

35:30.837 --> 35:34.251
Hey, take revenge now,
and it's over.

35:34.424 --> 35:38.464
But that coil inside
stays just as tight, Doc.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.880
What if her suffering
wasn't just a gunshot away?

35:42.057 --> 35:43.719
What if you could make it last?

35:43.892 --> 35:46.225
You got a better idea?

35:46.394 --> 35:49.228
Yeah, actually I do.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.310
You can claw your veins out,
it won't come off.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.225
Mattie told me.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.278
Stupid white witch healer whore.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.735
What are we doing here, Wynonna?
What is this stuff?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.400
Taste it.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.788
- Salt.
- No!

36:13.588 --> 36:14.920
No!

36:15.090 --> 36:16.922
Fields and fields
of the beautiful stuff,

36:17.092 --> 36:19.049
just waiting to snuff out
a witch's powers.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.960
Wait, wait! I can...

36:21.137 --> 36:23.049
I can help you get to Bobo.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.509
I know his secrets.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.141
I'll work for you.
I'll be your slave.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.891
- Listen to me!
- You dig.

36:34.359 --> 36:35.725
Wait a second.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.643
If I bury the witch,
what happens to me?

36:37.821 --> 36:40.063
You dig. I bury her.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.778
Loopholes are a beautiful thing.

36:42.951 --> 36:46.240
My dear, you do like
to make me sweat.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.704
Hey, Nedley out for dinner?

36:52.877 --> 36:54.493
You mean happy hour at Shorty's?

36:54.671 --> 36:56.958
Same time every day.
Kind of like clockwork.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.841
Hey.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.501
Wave!

37:07.225 --> 37:09.342
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.602
What is your problem?
Why are you...

37:16.735 --> 37:18.226
What happened to friends?

37:19.779 --> 37:21.111
You know what
I've always wanted?

37:21.281 --> 37:22.281
What?

37:22.365 --> 37:24.903
To parachute out of a plane
at 15,000 feet.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.114
Yeah. To swim far, far
out into the ocean

37:28.288 --> 37:29.824
so that I can't see
the bottom anymore.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.976
- To eat geoduck.
- Isn't that what looks like a...

37:32.000 --> 37:33.241
Yeah, it is.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.001
Point is, I've always wanted
to do things that scared me.

37:36.171 --> 37:40.791
But, well,
it's not so easy to be brazen...

37:41.801 --> 37:46.466
when the thing that you want,
that scares you to death,

37:46.639 --> 37:50.223
is sitting right in front of you.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.979
- I scare you?
- Yes.

37:55.148 --> 37:58.607
Yes, you do. Because
I don't want to be friends.

37:58.777 --> 38:02.646
When I think about what I want
to do most in this world...

38:03.656 --> 38:05.147
it's you.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.444
Oh, God, that sounded
so much more romantic in my head.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.243
Just jump in any time, Nicole,

38:13.416 --> 38:16.033
because I really, really
don't know how to do this.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.294
Oh, sure you do.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.289
Maybe I should
just stop talking.

38:21.466 --> 38:25.130
See? You're getting better
at this already.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.212
Maybe you should
stop talking too.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.847
Maybe you should make me.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.000
Sorry.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.456
I just... I told him I had it.

39:00.630 --> 39:04.590
And then he went
and he collected all the bones,

39:04.759 --> 39:06.591
but I lost the lead.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.502
Constance,
you gotta watch the tears.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.157
This mascara's
clearly not waterproof,

39:10.181 --> 39:12.173
and it's not like you can
touch it up yourself.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.012
Now, what is this damn lead?

39:14.185 --> 39:17.599
It's the one thing
he'll never stop searching for.

39:17.772 --> 39:21.231
The one thing he needs.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.142
For what?

39:23.319 --> 39:26.357
To escape
the Ghost River Triangle. The curse.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.397
And you, Wynonna Earp.

39:28.575 --> 39:32.615
You and your promise of death.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.830
Dry your tears, witch.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.832
With this amount of salt
keeping you,

39:39.002 --> 39:40.834
you'll be pickled in no time.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.496
Wait! Don't...

39:43.673 --> 39:45.289
Don't leave me!

39:46.634 --> 39:48.250
No, no, wait!

39:48.428 --> 39:50.920
I-I don't want to be left alone!

39:51.097 --> 39:53.510
I owe you a heap of thanks.
And my life.

39:53.683 --> 39:57.472
Well, keep your life, Doc.
I'd only mess it up.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.227
Can I at least buy you a drink?

40:04.944 --> 40:06.526
I gotta get back.

40:06.696 --> 40:09.734
I thought the deputy marshal was
no longer in your good graces.

40:11.868 --> 40:13.154
Raincheck on the drink?

40:13.328 --> 40:14.785
Later, at home.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.571
You, me, and a forty
of something delicious.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.042
Are you sure no-one
is gonna find her out here?

40:23.212 --> 40:25.124
She'll be alone forever.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.039
I don't like to be alone!

40:27.216 --> 40:30.129
Come back! Come back!

40:30.303 --> 40:31.760
A sad fate indeed.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.592
Come back!

40:35.642 --> 40:37.133
Please!

40:38.186 --> 40:41.725
You passed your second assessment
with flying colours.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.106
- I didn't take a...
- Sure you did.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.733
Early this afternoon.
Don't you remember?

40:46.903 --> 40:49.987
Like, I mean, you had
three energy drinks

40:50.156 --> 40:51.692
and you swore
like a truck driver,

40:51.866 --> 40:53.949
but, yeah, you passed.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.327
- That sure sounds like me.
- There you go.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.663
But this does not
sound like you.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.574
Say something Dolls would say.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.244
You're a good deputy, Earp.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.586
No, that's not it.

41:09.759 --> 41:12.251
I'm not good at apologies or...

41:12.428 --> 41:14.761
- Feelings.
- Come on.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.173
I got you a gift.

41:18.351 --> 41:21.970
Aw, Dolls.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.639
Hmm. You really do care.

41:40.081 --> 41:43.165
Out of everyone, Bobo chose me
to bring you his message.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.451
Then I'm going to kill you.
He knows that, right?

41:45.628 --> 41:47.335
It's my honour to serve him.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.792
It's worth dying,
to see the look on your face.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.457
What look?

41:51.634 --> 41:53.375
The message from Bobo
to you is this -

41:53.553 --> 41:55.545
Bobo bought Shorty's.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.923
Ha-ha! See?
That's the look right there.

41:59.100 --> 42:02.389
It's freakin' great!

42:04.605 --> 42:07.973
It's ours now, my fellow
deviants and degenerates.

42:08.151 --> 42:12.566
And what it holds will aid
in our eternal salvation!

42:15.658 --> 42:17.399
And Wynonna Earp's...

42:18.953 --> 42:22.446
final damnation.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.295
Yeah!

42:35.305 --> 42:41.277
