04:23.959 --> 04:25.003
YOU KIDS HAVE FUN.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.483
WAIT.
YOU'RE LEAVING?

04:26.570 --> 04:27.876

BRYAN McKENZIE.

04:32.837 --> 04:33.925

04:34.012 --> 04:35.318
WHERE HAVE I HEARD
THAT NAME BEFORE?

04:35.405 --> 04:36.928
FROM ME.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.669
HE'S V.P. OF STERLING BOSCH'S
NEW YORK DIVISION.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.236
YOU SUSPECT YOUR BOSS
IS MIXED UP

04:40.323 --> 04:41.846
WITH THE MISSING
STRADIVARIUS?

04:41.933 --> 04:44.066
WELL, HE'S VERY BUSY
DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS,

04:44.153 --> 04:46.024
TRYING TO EXPAND OUR BRAND
PAST INSURANCE.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.157
HE DOESN'T WORK
THE FIELD ANYMORE,

04:48.244 --> 04:49.724
BUT HE TOOK THE VIOLIN ON
AS A CASE,

04:49.811 --> 04:51.465
AND THEN IT WENT MISSING --
DOESN'T ADD UP.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.728
IT'S PRE-1700 --
VALUABLE BUT SELLS FOR LESS.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.425
SO WHY IS BRYAN
INTERESTED IN IT?

04:55.512 --> 04:57.079
WHEN WAS IT REPORTED
MISSING?

04:57.166 --> 04:58.907
THAT'S JUST THE THING --
IT WASN'T.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.169
AND I ONLY KNOW ABOUT IT

05:00.256 --> 05:02.084
BECAUSE I SAW BRYAN
CREATING A FILE ON IT.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.260
HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE IT HANDLED
BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND,

05:04.347 --> 05:05.609
AND THEN HE CHANGED
THE SUBJECT.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.263
WELL, IF HE THINKS
HE HAS IT HANDLED,

05:07.350 --> 05:08.656
THEN HE ALREADY HAS
A HEAD START.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.440
WELL, HE'S BEEN WORKING
FROM HOME THE LAST DAY

05:10.527 --> 05:11.833
AND HAS NOT LEFT ONCE,
EXCEPT...

05:11.920 --> 05:15.750
TO TEACH HIS DAILY
TAI CHI CLASS.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.229
YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HIM?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.406
WELL, I CAN'T USE
STERLING BOSCH RESOURCES

05:19.493 --> 05:21.016
TO INVESTIGATE
MY OWN BOSS.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.757
THAT'S WHY I CALLED PETER.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.715
HE DOES LIKE
A GOOD GUT DETECTOR.

05:24.802 --> 05:25.934
BRYAN'S, UM...

05:26.021 --> 05:26.891
BIGGER IN PERSON?

05:26.978 --> 05:28.153
EASY, RIGHT?

05:28.240 --> 05:29.981
JUST WOULDN'T WANT
TO COME FACE-TO-FACE

05:30.068 --> 05:31.809
WITH HIM
IN A VERY SLOW FIGHT.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.942
IF BRYAN ISDOING
SOMETHING ILLEGAL,

05:34.029 --> 05:36.031
HE'S PUTTING
MY ENTIRE DIVISION AT RISK.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.554
AND WITH IT, YOUR JOB.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.774
WELL, YES,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE'S JOBS.RIGHT.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.950

HUH.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.872
YOU KNOW
HE'S SECRETLY HOPING

05:50.959 --> 05:52.874
THIS WILL BRING US
BACK TOGETHER, RIGHT?

05:52.961 --> 05:55.572
LIKE "IF HE CAN GET PAST
YOU HIDING THE TREASURE,

05:55.659 --> 05:57.095
SO CAN I" SORT OF THING?

05:57.182 --> 05:58.227
IF THIS IS A PROBLEM
FOR YOU...

05:58.314 --> 05:59.446
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.230
BUT WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH
