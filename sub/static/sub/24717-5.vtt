WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:05.070
This was the language of the
Gods.

00:05.172 --> 00:07.172
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:07.274 --> 00:10.409
leave behind coded messages?

00:10.511 --> 00:13.712
We may find information
that is vital to mankind.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.815
Messages that
are carved in stone

00:16.917 --> 00:19.485
and found all over the world?

00:19.587 --> 00:21.053
There has been an explosion

00:21.155 --> 00:23.188
in new discoveries of geoglyphs

00:23.290 --> 00:24.524
that we didn't
know about before.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.326
But once deciphered,

00:27.428 --> 00:30.229
will they reveal
a message of hope...

00:30.331 --> 00:33.932
Many of
the geoglyphs were created

00:34.035 --> 00:36.769
in order to contact
someone up there.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.404
...or a deadly warning?

00:38.506 --> 00:41.240
Just imagine
if we don't get that message.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.742
Humanity could be
in the balance.

01:14.175 --> 01:18.077
Saudi Arabia. 2004.

01:18.179 --> 01:23.048
While exploring the ancient
lava fields of Harrat Khaybar,

01:23.150 --> 01:26.385
amateur archaeologist
Dr. Abdullah Al-Saeed

01:26.487 --> 01:30.389
comes upon a number of
what appear to be stone walls,

01:30.491 --> 01:34.393
each approximately
three feet high.

01:34.495 --> 01:38.030
From the ground level,
Dr. Al-Saeed concludes

01:38.132 --> 01:42.201
that the structures have no
discernable pattern or purpose.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.639
That is,
not until four years later,

01:47.741 --> 01:52.411
when he obtains satellite photos
of the very same area.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.280
What he sees astounds him.

01:55.382 --> 01:59.518
There, detectable from the sky
are a vast collection

01:59.620 --> 02:03.188
of more than 400
stone enclosures.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.792
Known to the local Bedouin
as the Works of the Old Men,

02:06.894 --> 02:09.928
these mysterious structures
are quickly examined

02:10.030 --> 02:13.765
and are revealed to stretch
for hundreds of miles.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.635
They were within
what's referred to

02:16.737 --> 02:19.471
as-as a lava field of activity.

02:19.573 --> 02:23.208
They're generally described
either as kites

02:23.310 --> 02:27.212
or as gates,

02:27.314 --> 02:31.550
which are more rectilinear forms
of them.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.821
And there are literally hundreds
of these.

02:35.923 --> 02:40.058
In fact, they stretch
all the way from Saudi Arabia

02:40.161 --> 02:44.630
right away across to Jordan
and into Syria.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.900
They're kind of
like angular pyramids

02:48.002 --> 02:50.636
almost going off
into the distance like runways,

02:50.738 --> 02:53.071
widening at one end to being
short at the other end.

02:53.174 --> 02:56.008
Although no record exists

02:56.110 --> 02:58.710
indicating when these structures
were built,

02:58.812 --> 03:00.913
who built them or why,

03:01.015 --> 03:05.250
the predominant theory
among mainstream archaeologists

03:05.352 --> 03:08.053
is that they were constructed
for hunting purposes

03:08.155 --> 03:10.389
many thousands of years ago.

03:10.491 --> 03:14.660
What we think they are
are prehistoric hunting sites

03:14.762 --> 03:16.361
where gazelle and other animals

03:16.463 --> 03:19.231
would be driven
into the enclosure,

03:19.333 --> 03:22.334
and then on the outsides
of the enclosure, pits were dug

03:22.436 --> 03:24.281
and the animals
would fall into the pits.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.506
The kites, when you visit them
on the ground,

03:27.608 --> 03:28.874
are really hard to find.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.910
In the air you get
the whole pattern.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.112
There are literally thousands
of them.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.916
And they must have been in use
for thousands of years.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.629
And why did they
fall into disuse?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.364
That's an answer
we haven't yet got.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.923
Although the theory
that the stone structures

03:45.025 --> 03:47.392
were used for hunting purposes
is compelling,

03:47.494 --> 03:51.530
ancient astronaut theorists
argue that if these structures

03:51.632 --> 03:53.899
were really used
for hunting gazelle,

03:54.001 --> 03:56.902
the walls would have needed
to be more than three feet high

03:57.004 --> 04:01.139
since a gazelle can leap more
than ten feet into the air.

04:01.242 --> 04:05.644
Instead, they suggest
that because the structures

04:05.746 --> 04:07.579
are only viewable from the air,

04:07.681 --> 04:09.915
they should be considered
geoglyphs.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.584
A geoglyph is just basically

04:12.686 --> 04:16.088
a drawing on the landscape,
usually quite large scale.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.923
Most geoglyphs are in deserts,

04:18.024 --> 04:19.502
and in deserts
you get a phenomenon

04:19.526 --> 04:21.226
which we call desert varnish.

04:21.327 --> 04:24.596
It's just a natural dark patina
that builds up on the surface.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.566
So if you move the dark parts
to one side,

04:27.668 --> 04:29.968
expose the lighter soil
or sand underneath,

04:30.070 --> 04:32.938
that is one way
of making a drawing.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.942
The second basic technique
is to use the dark stones

04:37.044 --> 04:39.444
and pile them together
to make shapes.

04:39.546 --> 04:43.782
Geometric shapes, animal shapes
or whatever.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.185
And the third basic technique is
simply a combination of the two.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.588
You move things to one side
to expose lightness,

04:49.690 --> 04:51.601
you use the dark stones
to make patterns.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.426
So, you get very nice
combination of the two.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.673
In recent years,
thanks to modern technology,

04:56.697 --> 04:58.737
and particularly
satellite photographs,

04:58.766 --> 05:01.044
uh, there has been an explosion
in new discoveries

05:01.068 --> 05:03.435
of-of geoglyphs that we didn't
know about before.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.373
The interesting fact
about all of these

05:08.475 --> 05:11.310
is that they point
towards the sky.

05:11.412 --> 05:14.012
And what might this tell us?

05:14.114 --> 05:17.616
Well, the first thing is
that many of the geoglyphs

05:17.718 --> 05:21.486
that we know today
were only discovered

05:21.588 --> 05:26.692
once aerial survey
started in around the 1920s.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.860
All of them were
only really revealed

05:28.962 --> 05:31.630
once aircraft got up
into the air.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.566
And this tells us something
very, very important.

05:34.668 --> 05:39.638
Most geoglyphs really
only make sense from above.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.808
It therefore seems
that they would be messages

05:42.910 --> 05:45.344
to something nonhuman,
something up there.

05:45.446 --> 05:49.014
When the now legendary
Nazca Lines of Peru

05:49.116 --> 05:51.817
were first discovered in 1927,

05:51.919 --> 05:54.886
they were considered
a unique phenomenon.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.657
But now, with the benefit
of satellite imagery,

05:58.759 --> 06:00.726
thousands of ancient geoglyphs

06:00.828 --> 06:03.562
are being found
all over the world:

06:03.664 --> 06:07.833
in Kazakhstan, in the
Southwestern United States,

06:07.935 --> 06:13.672
in the Atacama Desert of Chile
and in Bolivia.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.907
Almost everywhere
around the world,

06:16.009 --> 06:18.677
we find what are known
as geoglyphs.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.947
Whether they be
the Nazca Lines in Peru,

06:22.049 --> 06:26.718
British geoglyphs to those
in the Middle East,

06:26.820 --> 06:30.188
they're something that are
virtually universal

06:30.290 --> 06:32.691
around the world
and they've been appearing

06:32.793 --> 06:34.526
for many hundreds of years.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.862
But why would ancient people

06:36.964 --> 06:40.198
in so many different locations
around the world

06:40.300 --> 06:44.736
all be making signs that can
only be seen from above?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.783
We don't know for sure
what ancient peoples

06:46.807 --> 06:48.618
were trying to communicate
through geoglyphs,

06:48.642 --> 06:52.477
but the most important thing is
the amount of time and effort

06:52.579 --> 06:53.979
that went into building them.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.647
They're not quick sketches.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.117
They're, many of them,
whole community projects.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.897
And the time that you spend
working on them

07:00.921 --> 07:03.121
is time not spent
gathering food,

07:03.223 --> 07:05.490
not spent defending your land.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.326
It's time not spent
looking after your children.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.430
So, the first thing
that they communicate

07:11.532 --> 07:14.933
is to the community itself what
is important to the community.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.502
But could there be another

07:17.604 --> 07:20.405
even more incredible
explanation?

07:20.507 --> 07:24.309
Is it possible that these
ancient geoglyphs were created

07:24.411 --> 07:29.481
not for a terrestrial purpose,
but for an extraterrestrial one?

07:29.583 --> 07:33.185
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

07:33.287 --> 07:35.754
and suggest further clues
can be found

07:35.856 --> 07:38.123
by examining similar shapes
and symbols

07:38.225 --> 07:40.592
that occur
on a much smaller scale.

07:40.694 --> 07:45.497
Geoglyphs are
gigantic-sized versions

07:45.599 --> 07:47.365
of what we know as petroglyphs,

07:47.468 --> 07:50.268
the most obvious being
the rock art that we'd see

07:50.370 --> 07:53.638
on surfaces of stone rock
around the world

07:53.740 --> 07:56.641
that date back many, many
thousands of years.

07:56.743 --> 08:00.011
Petroglyphs are images
carved into stones or incised

08:00.113 --> 08:01.847
or hammered away.

08:01.949 --> 08:06.318
They occur all over the world
from Australia up through Asia,

08:06.420 --> 08:09.387
Europe, Africa,
through the Americas.

08:11.425 --> 08:13.625
Perhaps more intriguing

08:13.727 --> 08:15.660
than the petroglyphs themselves

08:15.762 --> 08:18.063
are the eerie similarities
between them

08:18.165 --> 08:21.500
and their geoglyphic siblings.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.169
We see certain symbols
recurring again and again.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.372
There are many geometric forms.

08:27.474 --> 08:31.476
These take the form
of, uh, spirals,

08:31.578 --> 08:34.312
of concentric rings

08:34.414 --> 08:37.816
and other more rectilinear
or abstract designs.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.318
They're something that
are virtually universal

08:40.419 --> 08:42.087
around the world.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.723
One of the most interesting
geoglyphs that you have at Nazca

08:44.825 --> 08:46.785
is the sun, star,
cross geoglyph,

08:46.860 --> 08:50.929
which is really a very
complicated huge mandala

08:51.031 --> 08:54.399
of interconnected stars
and triangles.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.668
And it's something we see
all over the world

08:56.770 --> 09:00.171
and in Tibet and India
as mandalas and even yantras.

09:00.274 --> 09:05.243
So, things like this that are
so geometrically complicated

09:05.345 --> 09:07.345
and are found all over the world

09:07.447 --> 09:10.515
indicates that there was
some kind of worldwide

09:10.617 --> 09:14.452
symbolic language
that was brought here

09:14.555 --> 09:17.856
by a higher intelligence,
probably extraterrestrials.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.759
Is it possible
that the thousands

09:20.861 --> 09:23.028
of mysterious petroglyphs
and geoglyphs

09:23.130 --> 09:24.429
found throughout the world

09:24.531 --> 09:27.399
were intended to be
a form of communication

09:27.501 --> 09:32.270
between early humans
and extraterrestrial visitors?

09:32.372 --> 09:35.907
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe that proof

09:36.009 --> 09:39.077
of such a profound idea
does exist

09:39.179 --> 09:42.480
and it can be found
by examining an ancient story

09:42.583 --> 09:45.383
associated with one of
the oldest petroglyphs

09:45.485 --> 09:47.452
ever discovered.

09:50.424 --> 09:54.893
Northwest Nevada. 2013.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.730
In the dried-up bed of what was
once Winnemucca Lake,

09:58.832 --> 10:00.832
researchers take
carbonate samples

10:00.934 --> 10:04.569
from a series of recently
discovered limestone boulders.

10:04.671 --> 10:09.808
They are covered with what
appears to be ancient carvings.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.744
Some of the petroglyphs
are believed to be depictions

10:12.846 --> 10:14.245
of ancient shipping techniques,

10:14.348 --> 10:18.516
but others are much more
difficult to identify.

10:20.587 --> 10:24.689
Even more mysterious is the fact
that the local Paiute people

10:24.791 --> 10:28.326
say the petroglyphs were not
created by their ancestors,

10:28.428 --> 10:31.963
but by a race of giants.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.498
The Paiutes said that

10:33.600 --> 10:36.501
initially they did not
create petroglyphs,

10:36.603 --> 10:40.939
that an ancient race
called the Si-Te-Cah did.

10:41.041 --> 10:45.043
The Si-Te-Cah was
a race of giants

10:45.145 --> 10:50.015
that was said to have been
white-complected,

10:50.117 --> 10:53.785
having red hair, and well over
seven-foot tall.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.122
The Paiutes explained that
these giants lived on the lake...

10:57.224 --> 10:59.891
In Pyramid Lake,
on floating cities.

11:01.595 --> 11:04.729
And each Paiute legend has
their own versions

11:04.831 --> 11:06.876
of how petroglyphs were
originally created.

11:06.900 --> 11:11.870
But they remain, to this day,
unaware now of what

11:11.972 --> 11:16.441
a lot of that language was,
like most tribes in the world.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.045
Samples of
the petroglyphs were taken

11:20.147 --> 11:22.647
to the University of Colorado
at Boulder,

11:22.749 --> 11:26.384
where scientists performed
a series of radiocarbon tests

11:26.486 --> 11:28.219
to determine their age.

11:28.321 --> 11:33.158
The results are astonishing,
and reveal the petroglyphs

11:33.260 --> 11:39.531
were etched between 10,500
and 14,800 years ago,

11:39.633 --> 11:41.593
making them
the oldest petroglyphs

11:41.668 --> 11:44.369
ever found in North America.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.171
When we look at petroglyphs,

11:46.273 --> 11:48.673
with their incredible spirals,
the doorways,

11:48.775 --> 11:50.453
the strange beings
that are featured,

11:50.477 --> 11:51.943
the stories that are told,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.179
it suggests that they all
have an origin

11:54.281 --> 11:56.281
with extraterrestrials
themselves.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.350
Could the petroglyphs found

11:59.453 --> 12:02.087
at Winnemucca Lake
really have been created

12:02.189 --> 12:05.957
by an ancient race of
extraterrestrial giants?

12:06.059 --> 12:10.195
If so, what were they intended
to represent?

12:10.297 --> 12:14.132
A map indicating
their planet of origin?

12:14.234 --> 12:17.702
Or was it an alien form
of hieroglyphics which,

12:17.804 --> 12:20.705
when deciphered,
could teach us profound lessons

12:20.807 --> 12:23.074
about mankind's past?

12:23.176 --> 12:27.045
Perhaps further clues can be
found by examining geoglyphs

12:27.147 --> 12:32.283
that some believe are depictions
of actual alien beings.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.558
The Atacama Desert, Chile.

12:40.660 --> 12:45.230
Located on the western side
of a hill called Cerro Unitas

12:45.332 --> 12:48.299
is an enormous geoglyph
of a human-like figure

12:48.401 --> 12:51.336
known as the Atacama Giant.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.105
Although its origins
remain a mystery,

12:54.207 --> 12:58.777
some have estimated it to be
as much as 10,000 years old.

12:58.879 --> 13:02.781
The Atacama Giant
is one of about

13:02.883 --> 13:05.750
500 petroglyphs
in the Atacama Desert

13:05.852 --> 13:09.120
that span a huge area of about
15,000 square kilometers,

13:09.222 --> 13:12.023
produced over about
a millennium of time,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.125
and linking cultures
from the Incas

13:14.227 --> 13:17.195
all the way up to
the early Christianization

13:17.297 --> 13:18.930
of South America.

13:19.032 --> 13:23.501
The Atacama Giant itself
is about 100 meters tall,

13:23.603 --> 13:26.171
and it's a hugely
impressive figure.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.873
It's got the most amazing
symmetry and geometry,

13:28.975 --> 13:32.043
which would have required
the most exquisite planning.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.445
Because once you're up there
digging away,

13:34.548 --> 13:37.048
you can't see exactly
the proportions.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.951
It's clearly a focal point

13:40.053 --> 13:42.387
of the culture of the people
who made it.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.389
It has these very strange

13:44.491 --> 13:48.493
horizontal and vertical lines
coming out of its head.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.062
Archaeoastronomers have
suggested that

13:51.164 --> 13:54.365
every part of this figure
was actually used

13:54.467 --> 13:57.035
for astronomical purposes.

13:57.137 --> 14:02.807
It marked the different cycles
of the moon in every year.

14:02.909 --> 14:06.211
If you ask the local elders

14:06.313 --> 14:09.981
what the Atacama Giant
represents,

14:10.083 --> 14:14.352
they will say that it represents
sacred space,

14:14.454 --> 14:17.222
and that actually entering
inside them

14:17.324 --> 14:20.592
allowed you communication
with the sky gods.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.097
Given that these geoglyphs
have multiple layers of meaning

14:26.199 --> 14:28.233
and much knowledge
encoded with them,

14:28.335 --> 14:31.970
we have to ask if maybe
it's also a device

14:32.072 --> 14:35.640
to tell the locals when the
extraterrestrials would return.

14:37.777 --> 14:41.112
Although the
Atacama Giant is extraordinary,

14:41.214 --> 14:43.548
it is by no means unique,

14:43.650 --> 14:45.461
as similar geoglyphs
can be found

14:45.485 --> 14:48.019
in many parts of the world.

14:52.158 --> 14:55.260
Blythe, California.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.863
Located in the desert,
just west of the Arizona border,

14:58.965 --> 15:02.901
an estimated 300 gigantic
figures can be seen etched

15:03.003 --> 15:04.836
in the arid ground.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.442
Known as the Blythe Intaglios,
these ancient carvings depict

15:11.544 --> 15:14.212
animals, spirals,

15:14.314 --> 15:16.281
and, perhaps
most significantly,

15:16.383 --> 15:18.917
gigantic humanoid figures.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.452
These intaglios are unique

15:21.554 --> 15:24.722
in that they're always found
on the shorelines

15:24.824 --> 15:29.627
of ancient lakes that existed
12,500 years ago and prior.

15:32.866 --> 15:35.500
In April 2018,

15:35.602 --> 15:38.736
author and ancient astronaut
researcher David Childress

15:38.838 --> 15:42.407
traveled to Blythe to meet with
Alfredo Figueroa,

15:42.509 --> 15:44.909
an elder of the local
Chemehuevi tribe.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.051
He is also known
to many in the region

15:47.113 --> 15:50.014
as The Guardian of the Glyphs.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.351
David was eager to see firsthand
whether the legends

15:53.453 --> 15:56.254
surrounding these unique
geoglyphs could be true.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.334
They can only be seen
from the air, really, right?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.936
Well, they can be seen
from the ground,

15:59.960 --> 16:02.093
but you can see it over intact.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.361
If you're walking on it,

16:03.463 --> 16:05.541
you really don't know
what you're walking on.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.698
Exactly, yeah, right.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.577
We'll be able to see it
with the drone, I think.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.346
Oh, that's excellent.
You got a drone?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.014
- Yes, we've got it.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.616
- Let me get the drone out.
- That's the best way.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.600
- Okay, let me get it.
- Thank you.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.811
Who builds this, and-and why?

16:19.913 --> 16:21.846
The original tribes
here were the Aztecas.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.281
The Aztecs.
- Right.

16:23.383 --> 16:26.851
Okay. Here we go.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.559
Wow.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.771
That's pretty interesting.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.795
With the drone camera,

16:37.897 --> 16:40.398
David and Alfredo
are able to see

16:40.500 --> 16:42.900
the Blythe Intaglios
from a vantage point

16:43.003 --> 16:45.043
that their creators
never could have,

16:45.071 --> 16:49.574
at least not without the aid
of some form of aircraft.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.378
But if this is true,
then why were they created?

16:53.480 --> 16:55.380
And for whom?

16:55.482 --> 16:56.681
All right, this is...

16:56.783 --> 16:57.882
Is Omecihuatl.

16:57.984 --> 17:01.152
"Cihuatl" means "woman."

17:01.254 --> 17:03.921
And she is pregnant,
right here, see?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.690
She's, like,
having a baby, then.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.025
Ah, okay.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.560
And right next to her
is the ocelot.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.096
Ocelot is the jaguar.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.731
Okay, so you can see it's a cat

17:13.833 --> 17:15.833
because it has
a very long tail, huh?

17:15.935 --> 17:18.903
Well, the tail is supposed to be
like a "U,"

17:19.005 --> 17:23.741
and in the cosmos,
it represents the Big Dipper.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.613
Here in this place,
they came down.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.616
And because they descended
from the cosmos,

17:31.718 --> 17:35.286
our ancestors created
these images

17:35.388 --> 17:39.290
and aligned them with
the constellations

17:39.392 --> 17:42.393
so that we would understand
that story.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.929
But of all the Blythe Intaglios,

17:45.031 --> 17:47.298
the one Alfredo is
most eager to show David

17:47.400 --> 17:50.201
are the ones
that are the largest

17:50.303 --> 17:51.803
and arguably the most dramatic.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.771
This is big. This thing is huge.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.774
That's right.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.876
They are the ones representing

17:58.978 --> 18:02.914
the Aztec gods, Kokopelli...
Better known as Quetzalcoatl...

18:03.016 --> 18:06.217
And Cicimitl,
the Aztec star god.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.819
Which glyph is this one?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.921
What we're seeing here
is Kokopelli,

18:10.023 --> 18:12.423
and he represents Quetzalcoatl.

18:12.525 --> 18:16.394
The Aztec god, Quetzalcoatl.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.063
- So, this one is...
- Cicimitl.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.132
Cicimitl.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.002
His face there...
You see his nose.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.738
I mean, he's not like
a normal person, is he?

18:27.841 --> 18:30.641
No, he looks just like a...
a E.T.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.311
He looks like an
extraterrestrial. Uh-huh, yeah.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.647
An extraterrestrial?

18:36.749 --> 18:40.318
Is it possible that these
incredible geoglyphs represent

18:40.420 --> 18:44.722
not just mythological gods,
but actual alien beings,

18:44.824 --> 18:48.893
whose arrival on Earth was
witnessed by the Azteca people?

18:50.763 --> 18:53.464
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

18:53.566 --> 18:57.101
and Alfredo Figueroa is
convinced that it was here...

18:57.203 --> 19:01.038
The location of the Aztecs'
legendary home of Aztlan...

19:01.141 --> 19:05.676
Where extraterrestrial visitors
came down from the sky.

19:05.778 --> 19:09.447
Aztlan is very
important in Aztec mythology.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.984
It was a place where the gods
came down to give them

19:13.086 --> 19:16.687
the information and prophecies
that the Aztecs had.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.892
I mean, you're maintaining
that this whole area here,

19:20.994 --> 19:22.905
around Blythe
and the Colorado River,

19:22.929 --> 19:25.963
is an ancient homeland
of-of the Aztecs

19:26.065 --> 19:28.533
- and-and the gods, too?
- Yes.

19:28.635 --> 19:32.904
The geoglyphs were made by
the Nahuatl people.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.908
The Nahuatl are the origin of
the Aztecas and the Mexicas.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.544
So, they're the ones
that made 'em at first.

19:39.646 --> 19:43.181
And then the Nahuatl people
made these geoglyphs to...

19:43.283 --> 19:45.917
to honor, uh, the creator gods.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.719
Right. And to not forget
where we came from.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.599
Where we came from.
That's right.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.191
Could it be
that Blythe, California,

19:53.293 --> 19:56.994
really was the ancestral home
of the Aztec people,

19:57.096 --> 19:59.897
and that more than
1,000 years ago,

19:59.999 --> 20:03.901
the area was visited by
extraterrestrial beings?

20:04.003 --> 20:07.672
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that the answers

20:07.774 --> 20:09.574
may be found by examining

20:09.676 --> 20:12.243
the most mysterious geoglyphs
of all,

20:12.345 --> 20:17.281
incredible markings that are
invisible to the naked eye.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.321
Palpa, Peru.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.257
December 2017.

20:26.359 --> 20:30.595
Researchers use state-of-the-art
drones to photograph

20:30.697 --> 20:34.732
the famous Nazca Lines
with high-resolution cameras.

20:34.834 --> 20:38.002
This is new technology
being employed

20:38.104 --> 20:39.704
to search the landscape,

20:39.806 --> 20:42.773
and to try and find
what the human eye

20:42.875 --> 20:46.711
has not been able to notice
and not even from airplanes.

20:46.813 --> 20:50.081
What the researchers
find amazes them,

20:50.183 --> 20:54.252
as the HD camera reveals dozens
of additional geoglyphs

20:54.354 --> 20:56.621
that had never been seen before.

20:56.723 --> 21:00.858
They include a huge serpent,

21:00.960 --> 21:04.762
and also a giant fish,

21:04.864 --> 21:06.998
both of which
are cosmic symbols.

21:09.135 --> 21:12.036
The thing is, with some
of the figures found in Palpa,

21:12.138 --> 21:15.139
they think they could be older
than some of the Nazca figures,

21:15.241 --> 21:17.019
because they're on hillsides,
and it's known

21:17.043 --> 21:20.478
that the Paracas culture, who
were around before the Nazca,

21:20.580 --> 21:23.881
going back to probably 800 BC,
or even earlier.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.217
It does suggest
that there was more cultures

21:26.319 --> 21:28.030
than just
the Nazca people creating

21:28.054 --> 21:33.224
these effigies and lines in that
part of the whole Nazca region.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.293
More geoglyphs,

21:35.395 --> 21:39.463
created by cultures stretching
back nearly 3,000 years?

21:39.565 --> 21:41.499
But who were they?

21:41.601 --> 21:44.068
What were they trying
to communicate?

21:44.170 --> 21:46.637
One has to wonder,

21:46.739 --> 21:50.741
why did our ancestors
create these things

21:50.843 --> 21:54.078
if they can only be appreciated
from the air?

21:56.349 --> 21:59.850
Because here is the thing:
sometimes it has been proposed

21:59.952 --> 22:03.654
that the Nazca Lines were crests

22:03.756 --> 22:08.259
of different tribes,
of different societies.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.695
But if I were a society leader,

22:10.797 --> 22:13.597
and I had my crest created
on the ground,

22:13.700 --> 22:17.768
but I could not see it, I would
not be very happy with that.

22:17.870 --> 22:21.639
That many of them can
only be seen from the air,

22:21.741 --> 22:26.544
that suggests to me that many
of the geoglyphs were in fact

22:26.646 --> 22:31.549
created in order to contact
someone up there.

22:31.651 --> 22:35.119
The ancients were
trying to represent

22:35.221 --> 22:39.523
that which they believed
was coming from the cosmos,

22:39.625 --> 22:42.326
and that they themselves
were trying to communicate

22:42.428 --> 22:46.797
or make the link
with these cosmic beings.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.235
For ancient
astronaut theorists,

22:51.337 --> 22:53.237
the link between the Nazca Lines

22:53.339 --> 22:57.074
and extraterrestrial
communication is an obvious one.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.144
They believe ancient man

23:00.246 --> 23:02.913
would have no reason
to make such detailed

23:03.015 --> 23:05.916
and elaborate representations
of life on Earth

23:06.018 --> 23:10.488
unless they were trying
to communicate with someone.

23:10.590 --> 23:14.058
They also cite recent images
recorded on Mars

23:14.160 --> 23:17.261
as evidence
which supports their claims.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.597
Certainly, the photographs

23:19.699 --> 23:22.733
that have been taken
by the Mars orbiters

23:22.835 --> 23:26.937
and the landers and the rovers
would suggest

23:27.039 --> 23:31.242
there are actually
geoglyphs on Mars.

23:31.344 --> 23:34.078
These geoglyphic formations
are structural,

23:34.180 --> 23:35.958
like we see
with the American Indians,

23:35.982 --> 23:38.883
the Mound Builders,
those type of formations.

23:38.985 --> 23:43.053
We're also finding pictographic
images like the face on Mars,

23:43.156 --> 23:45.556
which have facial features.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.958
We have wonderful pictures

23:48.060 --> 23:50.428
of the surface of Mars,
and definitely

23:50.530 --> 23:53.898
on the surface of Mars,
we have some stone circles.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.435
Nature does not
create stone circle.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.037
Nature could make
one stone circle,

24:00.139 --> 24:03.107
but not three or four
put together.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.445
Of particular
interest to researchers

24:07.547 --> 24:10.448
is a recently discovered
geological anomaly

24:10.550 --> 24:14.418
that strongly resembles
a species of bird.

24:14.520 --> 24:18.055
In 2002, a member of
the Cydonia Institute discovered

24:18.157 --> 24:21.592
a parrot formation in
the Argyre basin area of Mars.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.995
After two geologists
and three veterinarians...

24:25.097 --> 24:28.232
One being an avian specialist...
Examined the formation,

24:28.334 --> 24:31.669
they confirmed that the parrot
formation had over 17 points

24:31.771 --> 24:34.939
of anatomical correctness, all
adhering to the proper shape,

24:35.041 --> 24:38.309
size and orientation
to a real parrot.

24:38.411 --> 24:41.312
The same motif can be
seen on a copper plate

24:41.414 --> 24:44.748
produced by the Hopewell Indians
that features the same type

24:44.851 --> 24:47.685
of parrot formation
with an upraised wing.

24:49.755 --> 24:52.289
Could the mysterious
parrot-shaped formation

24:52.391 --> 24:55.693
on the surface of Mars
really offer a link

24:55.795 --> 24:58.629
to the thousands of geoglyphs
found here on Earth?

24:58.731 --> 25:03.701
And, if so, does it offer
evidence that extraterrestrials

25:03.803 --> 25:06.704
have been using them as a form
of communication with humans

25:06.806 --> 25:10.174
for thousands of years?

25:10.276 --> 25:13.978
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and believe

25:14.080 --> 25:16.947
that the various geoglyphic
depictions of animals,

25:17.049 --> 25:21.318
humans and birds may not have
been intended as mere artwork,

25:21.420 --> 25:23.487
but as a form of language,

25:23.589 --> 25:28.158
whose message for mankind
has yet to be decoded.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.167
Elkab, Egypt.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.837
June 2017.

25:39.939 --> 25:43.474
A team of researchers
from Yale University

25:43.576 --> 25:46.610
and the Royal Museums
of Art and History in Brussels

25:46.712 --> 25:48.979
make an historic find.

25:49.081 --> 25:53.551
While exploring this ancient
city, they discover a number

25:53.653 --> 25:57.321
of rock art carvings,
which after closer examination,

25:57.423 --> 26:00.858
date back
an estimated 5,200 years,

26:00.960 --> 26:04.862
making them the oldest
monumental Egyptian hieroglyphs

26:04.964 --> 26:06.530
ever discovered.

26:06.632 --> 26:10.634
Using combinations of
various shapes and symbols,

26:10.736 --> 26:13.971
including representations
of humans and animals,

26:14.073 --> 26:15.973
hieroglyphics is regarded

26:16.075 --> 26:18.642
as a highly sophisticated
writing system,

26:18.744 --> 26:21.245
where every symbol
and combination of symbols

26:21.347 --> 26:24.682
has a specific meaning.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.719
When we look at the hieroglyphs
of ancient Egypt,

26:28.821 --> 26:30.666
they seem to have come
from nowhere.

26:30.690 --> 26:33.591
No one knows
where they came from,

26:33.693 --> 26:36.660
no one knows who they really
were designed for,

26:36.762 --> 26:39.162
or for their purpose, they just
appeared out of nowhere.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.831
So where did these come from?

26:40.933 --> 26:43.567
Were they sort of
just divinely inspired?

26:43.669 --> 26:45.202
Was it some other reason,

26:45.304 --> 26:47.905
was it some gods that emerged
and arrived

26:48.007 --> 26:50.374
and presented them
with this information?

26:50.476 --> 26:53.377
The term "hieroglyphics"

26:53.479 --> 26:57.715
literally means "holy writing,"
and ancient Egyptian texts say

26:57.817 --> 27:02.152
it was a gift given to them
from the god Thoth.

27:02.254 --> 27:07.858
There are legends from
all over the world that sky gods

27:07.960 --> 27:12.229
have come down to Earth
and given information

27:12.331 --> 27:16.934
of science and learning,
and also communication

27:17.036 --> 27:18.902
and of language to people.

27:19.005 --> 27:24.908
And early language and alphabets
are these symbols.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.880
We're here in Luxor Temple,

27:29.982 --> 27:35.085
and the hieroglyphs here...

27:35.187 --> 27:36.920
are so interesting.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.456
Most people would think that
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs

27:39.558 --> 27:44.495
is more like emojis, and symbols
where the sun and a cow

27:44.597 --> 27:47.131
would meet the sky, and you have
this picture of the sky...

27:47.233 --> 27:49.299
It's not pictures
next to each other.

27:49.402 --> 27:51.969
It's a proper language.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.605
It's a language
that has such precision

27:54.707 --> 27:57.074
that people
from all over the world

27:57.176 --> 28:01.679
can translate it
with the same exact meaning.

28:01.781 --> 28:06.116
All this language
was from the god of knowledge.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.796
That's what ancient
Egyptians believed,

28:07.820 --> 28:12.589
that god Thoth gave them
the language, with all it has.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.458
And the kings then used it

28:14.560 --> 28:16.627
to also communicate
with their gods.

28:16.729 --> 28:19.763
Ancient Egyptian kings knew
for a fact that their gods

28:19.865 --> 28:22.533
understood hieroglyphs.

28:22.635 --> 28:26.637
As described
in the Pyramid Texts,

28:26.739 --> 28:29.506
ancient Egyptian religious texts
that date back

28:29.608 --> 28:31.775
more than 4,000 years,

28:31.877 --> 28:35.512
a meteoric iron object
called the Benben stone

28:35.614 --> 28:38.816
was reported as having descended
from the heavens

28:38.918 --> 28:40.684
like a firebird.

28:42.421 --> 28:47.624
Even Egyptologists agree
that this type of a shape

28:47.727 --> 28:50.060
descended from the sky...

28:52.131 --> 28:54.698
...and made
a controlled landing.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.902
The Benben stone opened,
and people walked out,

28:59.004 --> 29:01.672
the first creator gods.

29:01.774 --> 29:06.176
Now, when I hear a story
like this, I wonder

29:06.278 --> 29:09.813
if this thing may have been
some type of a craft,

29:09.915 --> 29:11.782
because it is very reminiscent

29:11.884 --> 29:16.320
of the top module
of an Apollo rocket.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.657
The Benben came with
hieroglyphic inscriptions on it,

29:20.760 --> 29:24.027
and it was the first form
of hieroglyphic language,

29:24.130 --> 29:25.996
the gift from the gods.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.433
This was the language
of the gods.

29:29.535 --> 29:32.870
Did an otherworldly spacecraft

29:32.972 --> 29:35.739
bring the language of
hieroglyphics to the people

29:35.841 --> 29:40.444
of ancient Egypt
thousands of years ago?

29:40.546 --> 29:43.781
And, if so, could there be
a connection between hieroglyphs

29:43.883 --> 29:47.618
and the various individual
figures of animals,

29:47.720 --> 29:50.888
shapes and symbols found
in the world's

29:50.990 --> 29:53.624
petroglyphs and geoglyphs?

29:53.726 --> 29:56.693
It would seem that
these petroglyphs and geoglyphs

29:56.796 --> 30:00.097
are ultimately part
of this universal language

30:00.199 --> 30:01.632
that's the forerunner

30:01.734 --> 30:04.768
of hieroglyphic and pictographic
languages, too,

30:04.870 --> 30:06.570
like the Chinese for example.

30:06.672 --> 30:08.906
When we're really able
to understand

30:09.008 --> 30:10.908
these geoglyphs or petroglyphs,

30:11.010 --> 30:13.877
we may find
that there is a message for us

30:13.979 --> 30:16.547
that we have been missing
all this time.

30:16.649 --> 30:19.550
One day, hopefully,
we will find that knowledge

30:19.652 --> 30:22.886
and know that message.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.789
If hieroglyphs
actually represent

30:25.891 --> 30:28.725
a type of
ancient alien language,

30:28.828 --> 30:31.728
could their earliest examples
exist carved into rocks

30:31.831 --> 30:34.431
and etched in desert sands?

30:34.533 --> 30:37.768
Could they be trying to tell us
that Earth's history

30:37.870 --> 30:41.338
is very different
than the one we've been taught?

30:41.440 --> 30:45.309
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

30:45.411 --> 30:47.978
and suggest that instead
of viewing them as symbols

30:48.080 --> 30:50.480
of mankind's ancient past,

30:50.583 --> 30:55.419
we should start to look at them
as part of mankind's future.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.896
Kanda,
the Republic of Macedonia.

31:05.998 --> 31:10.901
There, isolated on a hill
in the middle of a vast steppe,

31:11.003 --> 31:14.137
sits a giant geoglyph
depicting a symbol

31:14.240 --> 31:17.441
known as the cosmic egg.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.410
According to ancient mythology,

31:20.512 --> 31:22.779
it is the great egg
of the universe

31:22.882 --> 31:28.285
from which a powerful deity
is often hatched or born.

31:28.387 --> 31:32.456
The concept
of the cosmic egg is universal.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.993
But what's so interesting
is that a multinational team

31:36.095 --> 31:39.029
who have been
investigating this site

31:39.131 --> 31:43.767
have come to the conclusion
that it's orientated

31:43.869 --> 31:47.304
towards the constellation
of Cassiopeia.

31:47.406 --> 31:51.875
Cassiopeia represents
the queen of Heaven.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.710
In addition to the alignment

31:53.812 --> 31:56.980
of the egg with
the Cassiopeia constellation,

31:57.082 --> 31:58.994
many scholars believe
that the symbol

31:59.018 --> 32:03.353
contained in the egg represents
that of the cosmic god Se.

32:05.391 --> 32:08.725
He represents
the all-seeing god.

32:08.827 --> 32:11.862
Macedonian myth
says that the god Se

32:11.964 --> 32:14.564
was the child
of the great cosmic mother

32:14.667 --> 32:16.300
and the supreme god father.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.969
While there are various theories

32:19.071 --> 32:22.539
as to who made the cosmic egg
geoglyph and why,

32:22.641 --> 32:25.976
ancient astronaut theorists
agree on one point,

32:26.078 --> 32:28.211
that this geoglyph,

32:28.314 --> 32:32.215
like the thousands of others
found all across the world,

32:32.318 --> 32:34.985
was intended to be more than
simply a work of art

32:35.087 --> 32:37.487
or indicate a place of worship.

32:37.589 --> 32:41.658
It was intended to communicate
something of great,

32:41.760 --> 32:45.062
possibly intergalactic,
importance.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.030
It would seem that

32:47.132 --> 32:49.766
extraterrestrials
arrived on Earth,

32:49.868 --> 32:53.337
and then taught humans
the meanings of these symbols.

32:53.439 --> 32:57.007
And then humans
then used these symbols

32:57.109 --> 32:59.187
to try and contact the
extraterrestrials themselves,

32:59.211 --> 33:03.580
either as giant geoglyphs
on the ground

33:03.682 --> 33:06.116
to even just petroglyphs
on the rocks.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.358
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

33:14.460 --> 33:17.294
that the notion that
petroglyphs and geoglyphs

33:17.396 --> 33:19.563
could represent
a form of communication

33:19.665 --> 33:21.543
taught to humans
by alien visitors

33:21.567 --> 33:25.402
is supported by our own
relatively modern science

33:25.504 --> 33:28.105
of semiotics.

33:28.207 --> 33:31.575
It is the study
of signs and symbols

33:31.677 --> 33:34.911
mankind will need to use
when trying to communicate,

33:35.014 --> 33:37.314
not only with
future generations,

33:37.416 --> 33:39.783
but with extraterrestrials.

33:39.885 --> 33:41.318
Pictographs are more than

33:41.420 --> 33:42.819
pretty simplistic pictures.

33:42.921 --> 33:45.922
They are, in fact, another way
of communicating entirely,

33:46.025 --> 33:49.960
not only on Earth, but in
a spacecraft sent to deep space

33:50.062 --> 33:52.896
to communicate
perhaps with beings

33:52.998 --> 33:55.399
we have no idea about
how they speak, write,

33:55.501 --> 33:58.035
or make signification.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.939
In 1991,

34:03.042 --> 34:05.108
the United States
Department of Energy

34:05.210 --> 34:07.244
assigned two teams of experts

34:07.346 --> 34:10.080
to the task of devising
a marking system

34:10.181 --> 34:13.583
for the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, or WIPP,

34:13.685 --> 34:16.186
a nuclear waste facility

34:16.288 --> 34:18.989
located in the salt beds
of the Delaware Basin,

34:19.091 --> 34:22.859
26 miles east
of Carlsbad, New Mexico.

34:24.897 --> 34:28.098
The project attempted
to find ways of communicating

34:28.199 --> 34:30.033
the hazard of the plant

34:30.135 --> 34:32.369
to humans living
in the distant future,

34:32.471 --> 34:36.306
humans who may have developed
entirely new languages

34:36.408 --> 34:39.609
or other forms of communication.

34:42.214 --> 34:45.114
One prominent member
of the project

34:45.217 --> 34:48.685
was space artist and science
journalist Jon Lomberg.

34:50.688 --> 34:56.460
Lomberg had previously worked on
NASA's 1977 Voyager mission,

34:56.562 --> 34:58.606
helping to determine
what sounds and images

34:58.630 --> 35:01.465
should be included
on a pair of golden discs

35:01.567 --> 35:03.633
being sent into deep space.

35:05.671 --> 35:08.004
They put together
a panel of people

35:08.107 --> 35:10.107
from a wide variety
of backgrounds,

35:10.175 --> 35:13.143
including me as an artist

35:13.245 --> 35:15.123
and as somebody
who had experience

35:15.147 --> 35:17.747
trying to communicate
with extraterrestrials.

35:17.850 --> 35:20.917
The idea being was,
if we can come up with a way

35:21.019 --> 35:23.987
of communicating
with extraterrestrials,

35:24.089 --> 35:27.023
then communicating with humans
10,000 years

35:27.126 --> 35:31.161
or a half a million years away
should be a piece of cake.

35:33.098 --> 35:35.732
Through their
research, the teams determined

35:35.834 --> 35:39.169
that simple images are
the most universally recognized.

35:39.271 --> 35:45.108
But some can only be understood
when paired with other images.

35:45.210 --> 35:47.777
We knew that there were
certain elements of human art

35:47.880 --> 35:50.614
that had appeared so widely

35:50.716 --> 35:52.594
that you could assume
everybody would understand them.

35:52.618 --> 35:55.252
And they were: the comic strip.

35:55.354 --> 35:58.855
The idea of a series of images
where first this happens,

35:58.957 --> 36:01.191
and then this happens,
and then this happens,

36:01.293 --> 36:02.792
you find that all over,

36:02.895 --> 36:06.897
from ancient Egypt
to the plains tribes

36:06.999 --> 36:09.032
to the Bayeux Tapestry.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.012
The idea of telling
a story with pictures

36:11.036 --> 36:13.270
seems to be something
that everybody knows.

36:13.372 --> 36:17.974
So we used the linear story
and the stick figure

36:18.076 --> 36:21.044
to try to explain
the meaning of symbols

36:21.146 --> 36:25.749
like the poison symbol
or the nuclear radiation trefoil

36:25.851 --> 36:27.984
or the "do not" sign.

36:28.086 --> 36:30.253
None of these are universal,

36:30.355 --> 36:33.223
but they're easily explained
with a little comic strip.

36:34.993 --> 36:38.395
The whole of written human
history is only 5,000 years old.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.398
It's only by the most
incredible efforts

36:41.500 --> 36:44.234
that we're able to read
the earliest human languages.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.816
So trying to guess how people
are going to understand things

36:46.905 --> 36:50.840
10,000 years from now requires
incredibly imaginative thinking.

36:50.943 --> 36:54.477
Symbols are universal, and thus,

36:54.580 --> 36:56.613
when we're looking
at hieroglyphs

36:56.715 --> 36:59.849
or petroglyphs on rock

36:59.952 --> 37:02.619
or geoglyphs,

37:02.721 --> 37:05.655
we have to also recognize

37:05.757 --> 37:07.757
that there are
universal symbols.

37:07.859 --> 37:11.494
We may look at them today
and not be aware

37:11.597 --> 37:13.964
of exactly what they mean.

37:14.066 --> 37:16.900
Just possibly some of them

37:17.002 --> 37:21.605
could have been influenced
by external sources,

37:21.707 --> 37:25.008
non-terrestrial intelligences,

37:25.110 --> 37:28.445
perhaps even extraterrestrials.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.982
These messages
potentially contain

37:32.084 --> 37:34.044
tremendous knowledge
for humanity.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.079
It could be something
very simple

37:36.121 --> 37:38.855
like "point yourselves
at this particular star system"

37:38.957 --> 37:42.192
or "meet us at this
particular time and place."

37:42.294 --> 37:44.828
And just imagine if
we don't get that message

37:44.930 --> 37:46.563
and don't make that meeting,

37:46.665 --> 37:49.699
or don't look to that
particular star system.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.269
Humanity could be
in the balance.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.473
Could it be that
the petroglyphs and geoglyphs

37:56.575 --> 37:58.308
found all over the world

37:58.410 --> 38:00.977
are not only examples
of how early humans

38:01.079 --> 38:02.912
communicated with each other,

38:03.015 --> 38:07.050
but their attempt to replicate
a more sophisticated form

38:07.152 --> 38:09.152
of extraterrestrial language?

38:11.189 --> 38:13.556
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

38:13.659 --> 38:16.426
and believe the evidence
can be found

38:16.528 --> 38:19.596
by investigating UFO encounters
in which witnesses

38:19.698 --> 38:22.198
reported seeing
hieroglyphic writing

38:22.301 --> 38:24.301
on alien spacecraft.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.140
Rendlesham Forest.

38:30.242 --> 38:32.375
Suffolk County, England.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.945
December 26, 1980.

38:36.048 --> 38:40.216
Near an airbase leased
to the United States Air Force

38:40.319 --> 38:41.885
by the R.A.F.,

38:41.987 --> 38:45.655
strange lights are reported
on the horizon.

38:45.757 --> 38:49.659
Two U.S. servicemen
are dispatched to the site

38:49.761 --> 38:51.661
to investigate what they believe

38:51.763 --> 38:55.198
could be a possible
downed aircraft.

38:55.300 --> 39:00.170
Some U.S. servicemen
at a base called Woodbridge

39:00.272 --> 39:03.239
saw a strange light
over the forest

39:03.342 --> 39:05.275
and went to investigate,

39:05.377 --> 39:11.114
and in a clearing
came across this landed craft.

39:11.216 --> 39:15.985
One of them saw these
strange sequence of symbols

39:16.088 --> 39:18.355
upon the side of it.

39:18.457 --> 39:24.394
The object then rose up
and disappeared out of sight.

39:26.431 --> 39:28.698
What were these hieroglyphs?

39:28.800 --> 39:33.002
Were we meant to see them?
Were we meant to record them?

39:33.105 --> 39:36.740
There are some very famous cases

39:36.842 --> 39:40.910
of hieroglyphs being seen
on the side

39:41.012 --> 39:45.281
of what appeared to be
flying saucers or UFOs.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.517
Another UFO incident

39:47.619 --> 39:51.988
where hieroglyphs were seen
on the side of a strange craft

39:52.090 --> 39:55.992
took place at Kecksburg,
in Pennsylvania.

39:57.796 --> 40:01.765
On December 9, 1965,
a fireball was seen

40:01.867 --> 40:05.101
streaking through the skies
of-of Michigan and Ontario

40:05.203 --> 40:09.372
and then crashing
in Pennsylvania.

40:09.474 --> 40:13.109
And this became known as
the Kecksburg UFO.

40:13.211 --> 40:15.712
But what they said
that they found

40:15.814 --> 40:19.149
on this bell-shaped object

40:19.251 --> 40:24.053
were strange hieroglyphic
writing all along the base,

40:24.156 --> 40:28.892
very similar to the early
pictographs and petroglyphs

40:28.994 --> 40:31.561
and geoglyphs that we find
all over the world.

40:31.663 --> 40:35.632
Could the details
of these and other UFO reports

40:35.734 --> 40:39.402
provide proof that
the geoglyphs and petroglyphs

40:39.504 --> 40:41.438
found all across the world

40:41.540 --> 40:45.975
were actually inspired by alien
encounters in the distant past?

40:48.413 --> 40:50.280
I believe that
one day we will break

40:50.382 --> 40:53.917
the entire code of the
ancient language locked away

40:54.019 --> 40:57.854
in the petroglyphs, geoglyphs,
and even megaliths of the world.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.356
And in it, we may
find information

41:00.459 --> 41:03.660
that is vital to mankind.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.862
When we're really
able to understand

41:05.964 --> 41:07.363
these geoglyphs and petroglyphs,

41:07.466 --> 41:10.700
we may find that there is
a message for us

41:10.802 --> 41:13.336
that we have been
missing all this time.

41:13.438 --> 41:14.971
One day, hopefully,

41:15.073 --> 41:19.275
we will find that knowledge
and know that message.

41:19.377 --> 41:22.445
It may be that there's a sort of
metaphysical time lock

41:22.547 --> 41:24.881
or a timeline for the decoding

41:24.983 --> 41:26.594
of the petroglyphs
and geoglyphs.

41:26.618 --> 41:27.984
Maybe now is the time

41:28.086 --> 41:31.221
for us to fully understand
what those messages are.

41:31.323 --> 41:35.391
Perhaps the keys
to breaking the alien code

41:35.494 --> 41:39.028
are all around us, and have been
hiding in plain sight

41:39.130 --> 41:41.965
for thousands of years.

41:42.067 --> 41:46.002
All we need to do to unlock
their mystery is to see them

41:46.104 --> 41:50.673
from the same perspective as
our extraterrestrial ancestors.

41:50.775 --> 41:53.810
We must look at them
from the sky.
