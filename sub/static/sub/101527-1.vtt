- Come on.
- <i>Police have already shut down the 405 freeway...</i>

- Give me a spot...
- <i>Authorities are asking people to remain calm.</i>

- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.351
You can't just
leave your car here.

01:42.384 --> 01:44.520
- It's gonna get towed.
- I don't fucking care. They can tow it.

01:44.553 --> 01:45.521
<i>Avoid crowded areas.</i>

01:45.553 --> 01:46.988

What do we do?

02:39.974 --> 02:41.610

03:20.648 --> 03:21.849
<i>All special experts

<i>because there are no longer
commercial flights running</i>

03:27.556 --> 03:28.624
<i>from the city.</i>

03:46.775 --> 03:47.742

03:47.776 --> 03:49.744
<i>Actually, she let
her body go all limp.</i>

03:49.777 --> 03:51.813
<i>It... It like,
makes it hard to drive.</i>

03:51.847 --> 03:52.615
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:52.647 --> 03:54.549
<i>And then Slate Atkins
saw him</i>

03:54.582 --> 03:55.951
<i>and chased him off
with his shotgun.</i>

03:56.083 --> 03:57.886
- <i>But it's dangerous.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

03:57.920 --> 03:59.155
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

03:59.188 --> 04:00.823
<i>What's wrong, Katie?</i>

04:00.855 --> 04:03.793
<i>You seem a little off tonight.</i>

04:04.526 --> 04:05.628
<i>What do you mean?</i>

04:06.462 --> 04:07.897
<i>It is kind of weird that</i>

04:07.930 --> 04:09.598
<i>we don't know anything
about you.</i>

04:09.630 --> 04:13.436
<i>We've been working together
for like seven months now?</i>

04:25.513 --> 04:26.549
Hey, you.

04:26.582 --> 04:27.916
Hey.

04:29.217 --> 04:30.753
Can't sleep?

04:33.087 --> 04:34.689
It's gonna be okay.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.127
What's the plan?

04:39.061 --> 04:40.897
You always have a plan.

04:42.830 --> 04:43.932
Guessing it's not holing up

04:43.965 --> 04:46.067
in this shitty motel room
for a month.

04:48.537 --> 04:50.573
I love it, but...

04:51.106 --> 04:52.675
I'm waiting for a call
from my friend.

04:52.707 --> 04:54.642
He owes me a favor.

04:54.676 --> 04:56.111
What kind of favor?

04:57.044 --> 04:58.547
A flight.

04:59.113 --> 05:01.616
Okay.
Where are we going?

05:07.890 --> 05:09.558
- No. No.
- Baby?

05:09.590 --> 05:11.226
- No, no, no. No.
- Ava?

05:11.260 --> 05:12.760
Listen to me.

05:12.794 --> 05:14.563
The virus has not
spread there yet.

05:14.596 --> 05:16.131
We'll go there.
We'll wait it out.

05:16.164 --> 05:19.068
And then as soon as it's over
we will come right back home.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.070
I can't believe you
right now.

05:21.102 --> 05:22.237
It's in the middle
of nowhere.

05:22.270 --> 05:23.571
It's perfect.
It's a farm.

05:23.604 --> 05:26.174
- Your family hates me.
- No. They don't.

05:26.207 --> 05:27.943
Your brother,
he hates me.

05:27.976 --> 05:28.976
No. I...

05:29.010 --> 05:30.578
Look, why don't you
go stay with your family?

05:30.611 --> 05:32.214
I'm sure it'll be much better.

05:42.623 --> 05:44.493
I'm sorry.

05:49.830 --> 05:51.633
I didn't mean that.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.505
You're welcome there.
They love you.

05:57.104 --> 05:59.075
Listen,
I know what I'm asking.

06:04.313 --> 06:07.082
But, it's...
It's our only option.

06:07.114 --> 06:10.285
We can go, literally,
like anywhere else.

06:10.318 --> 06:11.486
What do you mean?

06:11.520 --> 06:13.621
You just wanna drive around
and look for somewhere safe,

06:13.654 --> 06:15.157
when we know we
have a safe place?

06:15.190 --> 06:16.959
- It's not safe.
- It is.

06:16.991 --> 06:18.126
Then we're gonna lay low.

06:18.159 --> 06:19.861
It's gonna be fine.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.267
God, you always do this.

06:40.214 --> 06:43.818
I promise you I will never
let anything bad happen to you.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.116
Hello?

07:16.118 --> 07:18.254
Yeah.
Hold on.

07:21.289 --> 07:22.892
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:23.924 --> 07:26.127
<i>Yeah, we, um...
We made it out.</i>

07:26.727 --> 07:27.762
<i>Great.
That's great.</i>

07:27.796 --> 07:30.866
Yeah,
we're a couple hours away.

07:30.899 --> 07:32.635
We'll see you shortly.

07:33.135 --> 07:34.770
Bye.

07:41.109 --> 07:42.243
You ready to go?

07:55.257 --> 07:56.926
Hey.
Come on.

07:57.392 --> 07:58.761
<i>Hey.</i>

07:59.260 --> 08:01.229
<i>Thank you so much again.</i>

08:01.697 --> 08:03.666
<i>Don't worry about it.
I owe you big.</i>

08:04.733 --> 08:06.402
<i>Actually, before I forget.</i>

08:06.435 --> 08:08.237
<i>Ava, come here.</i>

08:15.243 --> 08:16.344
He's gonna take
your temperature.

08:16.378 --> 08:18.080
Okay, hold still.

08:22.349 --> 08:23.951
We gotta get going.

08:23.984 --> 08:25.887
Hey, I'm sorry
about the delay.

08:25.921 --> 08:27.289
It's not about the wait.

08:27.789 --> 08:29.358
I gotta get flying
before they won't let us

08:29.390 --> 08:31.193
up in the air anymore.

08:52.914 --> 08:54.116
Hey!
Hey now.

08:54.149 --> 08:54.883
Now.

08:54.917 --> 08:56.218
What are you doing?
Come here.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.885
Stop freaking out.

08:57.919 --> 08:59.020
Ava! Ava!

08:59.053 --> 09:00.088
Look at me.
Stop freaking out.

09:00.121 --> 09:01.356
Look at me.
Come here.

09:01.389 --> 09:02.791
Come here.
Come here.

09:02.823 --> 09:04.226
Come, come...
Eye contact.

09:04.259 --> 09:05.427
Look at me.

09:06.127 --> 09:08.997
You don't have to see anybody
that you don't want to see.

09:09.463 --> 09:10.433
Okay?

09:12.100 --> 09:13.769
You're gonna be fine.

09:15.202 --> 09:16.972
Do you believe me?

09:17.972 --> 09:19.842
You're gonna be fine.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.202
Kel?

09:47.235 --> 09:48.937
Kel, what are you doing?

09:48.970 --> 09:50.105
<i>Kelly!</i>

09:50.138 --> 09:52.040
<i>Stop the plane!
Stop the plane!</i>

09:52.073 --> 09:53.141
<i>Kelly!</i>

09:53.275 --> 09:54.242
<i>Kelly!</i>

09:54.976 --> 09:56.412
<i>Kelly!</i>

11:56.063 --> 11:57.366
- What?
- <i>Baby? Hey.</i>

11:58.033 --> 11:59.467
Did you make it okay?

12:00.367 --> 12:02.904
You can't force me to
come here and then ditch me.

12:02.938 --> 12:04.939
<i>I'm sorry I tricked you.</i>

12:04.972 --> 12:05.940
<i>I knew you wouldn't go</i>

12:05.973 --> 12:08.009
<i>if you didn't think I was
gonna go, too.</i>

12:08.043 --> 12:10.412
<i>They asked me to cover
the CDC in Atlanta.</i>

12:10.444 --> 12:11.679
<i>I had to go.</i>

12:11.712 --> 12:13.948
Then you should have
left me in LA!

12:13.981 --> 12:14.949
<i>Okay.
I'm sorry.</i>

12:14.982 --> 12:16.617
Just sit tight.
My brother's gonna pick you up.

12:16.650 --> 12:18.253
I'll call you later tonight.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.154
<i>Look at that.
Look at that.</i>

12:20.188 --> 12:21.490
<i>Can you start getting
pictures of this stuff?</i>

12:21.523 --> 12:22.424
<i>Look at this guy,
right here.</i>

12:58.360 --> 12:59.428
Hey.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.429
Ava.

13:47.308 --> 13:48.443
Hey, Max.

13:48.544 --> 13:49.678
Hey.

13:50.577 --> 13:52.279
Things calming down
for you guys at all?

13:52.313 --> 13:54.015
About the same
as it's been.

13:54.314 --> 13:56.117
Hey, you're Ava Boone,
right?

13:57.117 --> 13:59.020
- Hi.
- Makes sense you know Max.

14:00.321 --> 14:01.623
Well, I won't hold you up.

14:01.655 --> 14:03.525
Let me know if
you hear anything.

14:03.725 --> 14:04.793
You got it.

14:04.826 --> 14:06.528
- And be safe.
- You, too.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.728
Take care.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.297
Thanks.

14:17.105 --> 14:19.307
<i>We've just received
information from the FAA</i>

14:19.340 --> 14:20.709
<i>that the entire United States</i>

Mail come today?

14:54.608 --> 14:56.110
Mm-mm.

14:58.779 --> 14:59.781
Welcome.

15:00.615 --> 15:02.484
Thank God you're safe.

15:03.351 --> 15:05.754
Come.
Oh, sweetheart.

15:05.786 --> 15:07.621
Oh!
Oh, oh.

15:07.654 --> 15:11.092
I am so glad to see you!
Let me look at you.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.428
Oh!
How beautiful you are.

15:13.461 --> 15:16.164
Look at your hair!
It's so long, Amanda.

15:16.197 --> 15:17.164
I mean Ava.

15:17.198 --> 15:18.866
I always slip back,
don't I?

15:18.900 --> 15:21.102
- It's fine.
- Come on in.

15:21.135 --> 15:22.670
Make yourself at home.

16:31.206 --> 16:32.541
<i>She's gonna be
another mouth to feed.</i>

16:32.573 --> 16:33.708
<i>She doesn't know
how to do anything.</i>

16:33.741 --> 16:36.310
- <i>I'm just gonna have to...</i>
- <i>Give her a chance.</i>

16:36.343 --> 16:39.446
<i>All I'm asking you is to try
and get along with her.</i>

16:39.480 --> 16:41.650
<i>I don't want her family
coming around the house.</i>

16:41.683 --> 16:43.617
<i>I don't want anything
to do with what he's up to.</i>

16:43.650 --> 16:45.786
<i>She shouldn't get
mixed up in it either.</i>

16:45.819 --> 16:47.888
<i>She isn't our responsibility.</i>

16:47.922 --> 16:51.226
<i>As long as I'm here,
she has a place to stay.</i>

16:56.563 --> 16:58.799
<i>The CDC spokesperson,
Lindsey Palermo argues,</i>

16:58.832 --> 17:00.467
<i>protecting public health
is a paramount...</i>

17:00.500 --> 17:01.336
Sorry.

17:01.369 --> 17:03.205
Oh!
It's all right.

17:03.237 --> 17:04.939
Come on in.
Have a cup of coffee.

17:11.778 --> 17:15.416
I get it that it wasn't
your choice to be here.

17:15.449 --> 17:17.318
But I'm really happy
you're here.

17:18.386 --> 17:19.187
Don't mind Max.

17:19.219 --> 17:20.487
You know how he is,
set in his ways.

17:20.521 --> 17:21.523
Maybe a girl
would be interested

17:21.555 --> 17:22.957
if he loosened up
a little bit.

17:22.990 --> 17:25.759
Oh, trust me.
There's plenty of girls.

17:25.793 --> 17:27.795
Just no settling down.

17:29.796 --> 17:31.765
Oh, I think I'm gonna
take a little rest.

17:31.798 --> 17:34.235
Would you mind taking
that out to the boys?

17:34.268 --> 17:35.903
They'll be starving by now.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.475
Max?

17:41.008 --> 17:42.443
What?

17:43.011 --> 17:44.446
Brought lunch.

17:44.478 --> 17:45.813
Put it on the fridge.

17:51.451 --> 17:52.686
<i>Hi.</i>

17:52.719 --> 17:54.355
I fed your cows.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.258
I bailed your hay.

17:56.291 --> 17:57.693
What else you need?

18:01.461 --> 18:02.563
Hi.

18:03.997 --> 18:05.234
Hi.

18:05.832 --> 18:07.302
I'm Ava.

18:07.534 --> 18:08.603
Yeah.

18:09.437 --> 18:10.706
I know.

18:10.805 --> 18:11.939
That's Jake.

18:13.975 --> 18:16.245
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

18:16.344 --> 18:17.411
How's the fence?

18:17.445 --> 18:18.513
Fence?

18:18.545 --> 18:19.780
I started it.

18:19.813 --> 18:21.682
Yeah, I need you to
finish that today.

18:23.418 --> 18:24.285
It's raining.

18:24.319 --> 18:25.654
You're gonna get wet?

18:27.621 --> 18:29.957
- All right.
- Take Ava with you.

18:29.990 --> 18:31.992
- Hm?
- What?

18:32.025 --> 18:33.661
Yeah.

18:33.794 --> 18:35.596
You gotta earn your beer.

18:37.698 --> 18:39.301
You got any pants?

18:45.540 --> 18:46.541
Ow!

18:46.573 --> 18:47.808
Fuck.

18:49.976 --> 18:51.713
- You all right?
- Yeah.

18:58.919 --> 19:01.689
Used to be
three of us out here.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.792
You know,
everybody got scared.

19:03.824 --> 19:05.526
Going home to their families.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.561
Now it's just me.

19:06.594 --> 19:08.863
- And this is a huge property.
- Yeah, I know.

19:10.465 --> 19:12.534
Here. Why don't you
grab one of these?

19:12.566 --> 19:14.101
Get a good one.

19:14.134 --> 19:15.736
How do you know
it's a good one?

19:16.137 --> 19:17.606
You'll know.

19:18.872 --> 19:20.409
Stick it right there.

19:20.874 --> 19:21.809
This way?

19:21.842 --> 19:23.745
Yeah, like that.
Hold it tight.

19:23.777 --> 19:26.448
- Are you seriously gonna hit that?
- Just hold it.

19:27.881 --> 19:29.551
You slide this on top.

19:31.451 --> 19:32.486
Scoot.

19:33.153 --> 19:34.755
And then...

19:38.126 --> 19:40.495
I'm taking out
all my anger issues

19:40.527 --> 19:42.463
on this fucking fence.

19:43.898 --> 19:46.501
- It's leaning a little bit.
- Well...

19:48.169 --> 19:50.037
It's the thought that counts.

20:22.937 --> 20:24.805
All right.
First day.

20:52.099 --> 20:55.169
<i>You have nineteen
new voice messages.</i>

20:56.470 --> 20:57.838
<i>Hey, Ava?</i>

20:58.072 --> 21:00.909
<i>Look, I'm sorry.</i>

21:01.976 --> 21:04.446
<i>You know I'd be going crazy
if I was back there right now.</i>

21:04.478 --> 21:06.448
<i>I...
I couldn't sit this one out.</i>

21:07.715 --> 21:09.217
<i>I just wanted you
to be safe.</i>

21:09.249 --> 21:11.718
<i>Will you just call me back
so that we can talk about this?</i>

21:11.752 --> 21:13.789
<i>Okay?
I miss you.</i>

21:35.008 --> 21:36.477
You're good at this.

21:36.511 --> 21:38.447
Yeah, I used to do it
when I was a kid.

21:39.546 --> 21:41.216
Why don't you
take care of her?

21:41.248 --> 21:43.485
I'll go look after
the big ones.

21:43.517 --> 21:44.685
Okay.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.455
<i>Have fun!</i>

23:14.976 --> 23:16.311
It's for your hands.

23:22.283 --> 23:23.685
What's all that?

23:23.717 --> 23:25.119
Oh, I have the...

23:25.151 --> 23:28.021
I have the main house
and barn on back-up.

23:28.054 --> 23:31.759
The solar panels
and pump generators.

23:34.027 --> 23:36.197
I didn't know you were
such a doomsday buff.

23:38.265 --> 23:40.068
I like to be prepared.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.371
<i>Officials say that this
a temporary precaution.</i>

23:43.403 --> 23:46.707
<i>Many residents are wary
of being stranded long-term...</i>

23:49.643 --> 23:51.145
What do you need?
Okay.

23:52.246 --> 23:53.715
Oh.
Oh, sweetie?

23:54.114 --> 23:56.183
Will you make sure
we get this, please?

23:58.852 --> 23:59.955
Yeah.
Thanks.

24:03.658 --> 24:05.293
You need to
vacuum-seal those.

24:10.398 --> 24:12.833
Hey.
Go with him.

24:13.199 --> 24:15.969
I've gotta...
redo all these.

24:16.003 --> 24:17.138
I'll take care of it.

24:18.272 --> 24:19.808
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

24:21.141 --> 24:22.943
Hey!
I'm coming with you.

24:23.444 --> 24:25.013
No, you're not.

24:25.045 --> 24:26.715
Go finish with the meat.

24:35.755 --> 24:37.291
<i>Gas prices have been
sky rocketing,</i>

24:37.323 --> 24:39.794
<i>starting at just a few dollars
a gallon last week.</i>

24:39.826 --> 24:42.195
<i>We're now seeing a range
anywhere from ten</i>

24:42.228 --> 24:44.698
<i>to thirty dollars a gallon.</i>

24:45.932 --> 24:47.267
<i>We've got Walker
on the line right now.</i>

24:47.301 --> 24:49.404
<i>Walker,
what are you hearing?</i>

24:49.437 --> 24:52.140
<i>Nationally, we're facing
a huge crisis of fuel</i>

24:52.172 --> 24:53.807
<i>and panic issues.</i>

24:53.841 --> 24:55.909
<i>Gas stations can't
keep up with the demand,</i>

24:55.942 --> 24:57.377
<i>while deliveries are stalled,</i>

24:57.410 --> 24:59.813
<i>causing many residents
to stockpile fuel.</i>

25:00.480 --> 25:02.215
Whoa.
This is everything?

25:02.248 --> 25:04.184
<i>That's all we got.</i>

25:04.217 --> 25:05.687
- Come on. No...
- <i>Sorry.</i>

25:05.719 --> 25:07.822
<i>...the fuel shortage
is taking a toll on</i>

25:07.854 --> 25:09.957
<i>public transportation
as well.</i>

25:09.989 --> 25:11.825
<i>Many bus lines
have stopped running,</i>

25:11.859 --> 25:14.028
<i>causing businesses
to close temporarily</i>

25:14.061 --> 25:15.797
<i>due to absent employees.</i>

25:41.354 --> 25:42.457
- What?
- Stay in the car.

25:42.489 --> 25:44.692
- Are you kidding?
- Just stay in the car.

25:55.936 --> 25:56.904
Hey.

25:56.937 --> 25:58.406
You're good.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.782
All right.
You know what to do.

26:07.814 --> 26:08.982
What do you think?

26:09.015 --> 26:10.851
We're gonna... We're gonna
need some defense or something.

26:10.884 --> 26:12.853
Shh. Shh.

26:24.165 --> 26:26.000
<i>Yeah, I mean,
the interstate travel ban</i>

26:26.033 --> 26:28.468
<i>is affecting the delivery of
infrastructure, particularly...</i>

26:28.502 --> 26:29.570
Hey.

26:29.602 --> 26:32.039
- <i>...of the remote and more rural...</i>
- Hey.

26:33.306 --> 26:34.842
How're you feeling?

26:35.543 --> 26:36.644
Great.

26:36.678 --> 26:37.845
<i>...there's a lot of chaos
going on as they work</i>

26:37.879 --> 26:38.646
<i>to figure out exactly how
this virus is spreading...</i>

26:38.679 --> 26:40.981
Yeah, you should
be Sheriff, Buck.

26:47.987 --> 26:49.289
You sure you can spare it?

26:49.323 --> 26:51.258
I'd rather you
have it than them.

26:53.226 --> 26:55.963
Speaking of,
Bob wants a word.

26:55.996 --> 26:57.532
<i>Reporting earlier,
officials in LA</i>

26:57.564 --> 27:00.101
<i>have set up a triage center
at Dodger Stadium</i>

27:00.133 --> 27:03.003
<i>to attempt to handle the
heavy influx of patients.</i>

27:03.036 --> 27:05.305
<i>Doctors have cordoned
off specific sections...</i>

27:05.339 --> 27:06.407
Oh, hey.

27:06.439 --> 27:08.109
- Great, Bob.
- What do you want?

27:09.376 --> 27:12.280
What can I get for you,
Amanda?

27:12.313 --> 27:14.181
Um, shot and a beer?

27:16.449 --> 27:19.886
My granddaughter sure
loved that TV show of yours.

27:19.919 --> 27:22.856
They're all into that,
uh, vampire stuff.

27:23.323 --> 27:25.226
Now what is it?
Zombies?

27:25.258 --> 27:26.226
Werewolves.

27:26.259 --> 27:27.861
Yeah.
That's it.

27:28.595 --> 27:30.897
How about you, Jake?
You want another pop?

27:30.930 --> 27:32.600
- <i>Quarantines are expanding from twenty-three</i>
- <i>No, ma'am.</i>

27:32.632 --> 27:34.901
- <i>US cities to nearly sixty.</i>
- All rightie.

27:34.935 --> 27:37.171
<i>The number of reported
cases domestically</i>

27:37.204 --> 27:39.607
<i>has reached
ninety-thousand.</i>

27:39.640 --> 27:40.908
<i>Compared to
seven hundred-thousand...</i>

27:40.940 --> 27:42.910
Oh my God,
I'm stuck here forever.

27:43.444 --> 27:44.846
<i>This is happening.</i>

27:44.879 --> 27:47.448
- <i>I didn't know we've gotten to that point.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

27:47.480 --> 27:49.182
Well take a look
at the news, man.

27:49.216 --> 27:50.318
And they're only
getting worse.

27:50.351 --> 27:51.852
What are they talking about?

27:54.621 --> 27:57.390
Oh, they're talking
about forming a militia.

27:57.423 --> 27:59.960
And Max doesn't think
it's a good idea.

28:01.394 --> 28:04.364
<i>You can be with us,
or you cannot be with us.</i>

28:04.398 --> 28:06.301
So I'm acting like
I'm going to war?

28:07.034 --> 28:08.535
Call it what you want.

28:08.569 --> 28:10.371
But this is how it is.

28:14.608 --> 28:16.344
I'll be back.

28:17.044 --> 28:18.512
<i>All of this is adding
to the sense of fear</i>

28:18.544 --> 28:21.248
<i>and chaos as people fight
to get home to their families...</i>

28:27.420 --> 28:28.989
It's all right.
It's all right.

28:37.297 --> 28:39.165
Amanda, we've been
worried about you.

28:39.198 --> 28:40.333
When'd you get back?

28:40.367 --> 28:41.502
Why didn't you call?!

28:41.601 --> 28:43.371
She doesn't wanna
talk with you.

28:43.403 --> 28:45.138
None of your business,
Rhodes.

28:46.005 --> 28:46.407
Come on.

28:47.341 --> 28:49.409
Step away from the truck.
Let's go home.

28:52.045 --> 28:53.648
Step out of the way, son.

28:55.416 --> 28:56.985
Can't do that.

29:01.155 --> 29:03.291
This is family business.

29:03.323 --> 29:05.125
I said step aside.

29:08.461 --> 29:09.997
<i>Hey!</i>

29:10.264 --> 29:11.466
<i>Hey!</i>

29:14.133 --> 29:15.702
<i>Not in my place!</i>

29:15.736 --> 29:18.573
Now, you know I have zero
tolerance for this crap.

29:19.707 --> 29:21.542
Get back inside.

30:07.454 --> 30:08.623
Hey.

30:12.159 --> 30:13.727
Dinner will be ready
in an hour.

30:13.761 --> 30:15.330
You take a day off?

30:19.198 --> 30:20.601
<i>I had a meeting.</i>

30:22.335 --> 30:23.603
Where?

30:28.641 --> 30:30.311
Hm?

30:37.051 --> 30:39.087
They're doing something,
Max.

30:39.419 --> 30:41.221
What do you think
we're doing?

30:44.224 --> 30:45.326
All right.

30:45.359 --> 30:47.328
If you keep hanging out
with those guys,

30:47.361 --> 30:49.097
don't bother coming back.

31:24.297 --> 31:26.132
Where's the rest
of your insulin?

31:26.166 --> 31:27.601
I only have the one bottle.

31:31.205 --> 31:33.174
I'll be fine, sweetheart.

31:45.451 --> 31:46.553
Okay.

31:47.121 --> 31:48.855
Ava, hey, uh...

31:48.889 --> 31:51.192
Give me a call
whenever you can.

31:51.225 --> 31:52.493
Please?

31:56.130 --> 31:57.564
<i>You should call him back.</i>

31:58.265 --> 31:59.233
Why?

31:59.265 --> 32:00.601
He's just worried.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.303
He's trying to do
the best that he can.

32:03.336 --> 32:04.504
In his way.

32:04.537 --> 32:06.306
Then maybe he
should be here.

32:06.506 --> 32:07.674
<i>I just checked again.</i>

32:07.707 --> 32:09.576
<i>We have no insulin in stock.
Sorry...</i>

32:15.248 --> 32:16.583
This isn't working.

32:19.785 --> 32:21.621
How long is the bottle
gonna last?

32:22.156 --> 32:23.524
Not long enough.

32:25.225 --> 32:26.394
Where are you going?

32:26.726 --> 32:27.829
<i>I'm going out.</i>

32:28.594 --> 32:30.663
- Right now?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

32:30.697 --> 32:32.199
<i>Lock up.</i>

32:34.501 --> 32:36.537
Where are you going first?
You don't have a plan.

32:42.676 --> 32:45.880
<i>And we have Kelly Rhodes
on the line outside Atlanta.</i>

32:45.912 --> 32:48.481
<i>Kelly, any updates
from the CDC?</i>

32:48.515 --> 32:49.416
<i>Uh, thanks.</i>

32:49.449 --> 32:51.451
<i>Well, the CDC has declined
to comment</i>

32:51.485 --> 32:53.786
<i>and they haven't updated
their statement from last week.</i>

32:53.820 --> 32:56.790
<i>But, I've gotta say tensions
are high inside Atlanta.</i>

32:56.823 --> 32:58.859
<i>As you know, strict travel bans
have been in place</i>

32:58.891 --> 33:01.327
<i>for several weeks now.</i>

33:01.361 --> 33:03.597
<i>Frankly, people are scared.</i>

33:03.630 --> 33:05.866
<i>They wanna get
their families out.</i>

33:05.899 --> 33:07.834
<i>They want information.</i>

33:07.868 --> 33:10.271
<i>I think until we get
some sort of positive news,</i>

33:10.303 --> 33:13.373
<i>we're gonna continue
to see civil unrest escalate.</i>

33:51.311 --> 33:52.980
<i>Hey, this is Kelly Rhodes.</i>

33:53.013 --> 33:54.348
<i>You know what to do.</i>

33:57.918 --> 33:59.719
<i>Hey. Um...</i>

33:59.753 --> 34:04.225
<i>I know I've been avoiding
all your calls, but...</i>

34:04.257 --> 34:06.994
<i>...you should know your mom,
she's really getting sick.</i>

34:07.026 --> 34:08.628
<i>I don't know how
much she's told you,</i>

34:08.662 --> 34:11.532
<i>but the insulin
will be out really soon.</i>

34:12.532 --> 34:15.302
<i>If you could do anything.
Make some calls.</i>

34:15.334 --> 34:17.470
<i>We could really use
your help.</i>

34:18.671 --> 34:20.974
<i>Look, I know you think
what you're doing is important.</i>

34:22.675 --> 34:24.477
<i>We really need you here,
too.</i>

34:25.278 --> 34:27.747
<i>So just, come home.</i>

34:31.751 --> 34:33.286
Okay.

34:47.934 --> 34:50.438
- Any day now.
- Shut up.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.514
<i>Focus on those bottles!</i>

35:08.722 --> 35:09.990
This is a shotgun.

35:13.459 --> 35:14.561
All right.

35:14.593 --> 35:16.264
Yeah, you don't
hold it like that.

35:17.631 --> 35:19.033
You wanna hold it...

35:21.101 --> 35:22.869
...in the pock
in your shoulder.

35:23.602 --> 35:25.472
Okay, keep your elbow out.

35:25.505 --> 35:27.573
- See how it creates that pocket in there?
- Mm-hm.

35:27.606 --> 35:29.610
Okay.
You're gonna take your cheek

35:29.642 --> 35:31.644
and put it against the stock.

35:31.677 --> 35:33.713
Aim right down the center
of this barrel.

35:33.747 --> 35:34.915
Okay.

35:34.947 --> 35:36.849
All right.
Now, you barely have to aim.

35:36.883 --> 35:38.718
You just have to point in the
direction that you want to fire

35:38.751 --> 35:40.320
and you're gonna
hit something.

35:40.619 --> 35:41.888
Pump it.

35:42.356 --> 35:43.823
Now it's loaded
into the chamber.

35:48.128 --> 35:50.030
- It's gonna be loud.
- Okay.

36:00.539 --> 36:01.808
Yeah.

36:01.842 --> 36:03.843
Eject it.
Now there's a new one in there.

36:03.876 --> 36:05.478
Do the rest of them.

36:05.512 --> 36:06.680
Okay.

36:11.684 --> 36:13.420
This is awesome.

36:13.919 --> 36:15.722
- <i>That lipstick.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

36:19.793 --> 36:21.796
<i>Why do you even have
that many lipsticks?</i>

36:22.396 --> 36:24.698
All right, so now you need
to replace my bullets.

36:24.731 --> 36:26.066
And you need to replace
my beer.

36:27.534 --> 36:29.001
- You need to replace...
- Shut up.

36:29.035 --> 36:30.637
- ...your pride.
- It wasn't that bad.

36:30.669 --> 36:32.072
You need to replace...

36:34.407 --> 36:35.842
Hi, Amanda.

36:42.081 --> 36:43.616
<i>Max?</i>

36:43.650 --> 36:45.017
<i>Will you come inside,
please?</i>

36:45.050 --> 36:46.453
Here, I'll...

36:57.997 --> 37:01.568
I always loved you in,
um, short hair.

37:01.601 --> 37:03.503
But this is nice, too.

37:03.537 --> 37:05.172
What do you want, Maddy?

37:05.204 --> 37:06.739
I heard you were
back in town.

37:06.773 --> 37:07.941
I wanted to say hello.

37:07.974 --> 37:09.142
Okay.
Thanks.

37:09.175 --> 37:11.578
Can we talk a bit?
I...

37:12.778 --> 37:14.715
I wanna hear
all about your life.

37:14.747 --> 37:16.983
Really? That's it?
That's all you want?

37:21.854 --> 37:22.789
I'm tired.

37:22.822 --> 37:25.124
- I just need a little money.
- I knew it!

37:25.157 --> 37:27.493
Just a little bit
to get on my feet.

37:27.526 --> 37:29.061
You know how your father is.

37:29.095 --> 37:30.597
I never asked you
for anything.

37:30.630 --> 37:31.765
I don't owe you anything.

37:31.798 --> 37:33.167
That's no way
to talk to your mother.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.936
- You're not my mother.
- I am your damn mother.

37:37.604 --> 37:39.840
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it!

37:42.476 --> 37:44.445
Well I guess you never gave
a shit what happened to me,

37:44.477 --> 37:46.746
so I guess nothing's changed.

37:48.648 --> 37:50.117
Hey. Hey!

37:53.619 --> 37:55.054
It's what you want?

37:55.789 --> 37:56.857
Here.

37:59.159 --> 38:00.827
Hey.

38:00.860 --> 38:02.595
Don't come back here.

38:57.751 --> 38:59.553
Are you asleep out here?

39:01.621 --> 39:02.856
No.

39:03.789 --> 39:05.092
Just thinking.

39:07.860 --> 39:09.996
She's not gonna come
back to the house.

39:15.568 --> 39:17.070
Why did you wanna be
a farmer?

39:18.704 --> 39:19.672
I didn't.

39:21.140 --> 39:23.010
I wanted to race cars.

39:23.343 --> 39:24.778
Um, what?

39:24.811 --> 39:25.845
Yeah.

39:25.878 --> 39:27.180
When?

39:28.715 --> 39:30.684
Oh, before Dad got sick.

39:31.617 --> 39:33.553
But things got bad
senior year

39:33.586 --> 39:38.092
and someone had to
take care of the farm.

39:38.657 --> 39:40.827
College wasn't
my thing anyway.

39:43.997 --> 39:46.200
Yeah, well at least you
graduated high school.

39:47.099 --> 39:49.135
I pretend to be a werewolf.

39:49.970 --> 39:52.573
Every day.

39:57.343 --> 40:00.146
It's a really bad show.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.715
Nah.

40:02.182 --> 40:04.017
Don't be so hard on yourself.

40:05.352 --> 40:06.987
Yeah.

40:09.389 --> 40:11.258
You just kind of left.

40:12.892 --> 40:14.160
Real young.

40:15.829 --> 40:17.731
It didn't feel like
a choice.

40:18.231 --> 40:19.800
Yeah.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.570
<i>I just had to go.</i>

40:23.736 --> 40:25.104
<i>Change everything.</i>

40:25.137 --> 40:26.806
<i>My name, even.</i>

40:28.842 --> 40:30.778
<i>Kelly doesn't even
know all of it.</i>

40:32.012 --> 40:33.914
<i>Not everything.</i>

40:55.702 --> 40:57.271
Did you come here often?

41:00.773 --> 41:02.275
Yeah.

41:02.307 --> 41:04.244
I came here all the
time when I was a kid.

41:04.276 --> 41:05.713
By yourself?

41:06.111 --> 41:08.148
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

41:08.180 --> 41:09.916
I wouldn't take
anybody here.

41:15.689 --> 41:17.224
So who's house is this?

41:18.191 --> 41:20.060
Um, it was the, uh...

41:20.093 --> 41:22.428
hired hand
of my great-grandpa's.

41:22.461 --> 41:23.862
No way.
What?

41:27.934 --> 41:31.671
Um, his wife left him
and he went bankrupt.

41:31.704 --> 41:34.107
They took what they wanted
and didn't come back.

41:57.363 --> 41:58.765
In here.

42:03.503 --> 42:05.005
It's a trap door.

42:05.338 --> 42:06.473
To what?

42:06.506 --> 42:07.507
It's just a hole
in the ground.

42:07.541 --> 42:09.443
I used to hide stuff in here
when I was a kid.

42:09.476 --> 42:11.945
Mostly booze
and cigarettes.

42:11.977 --> 42:13.246
You got any left?

42:14.481 --> 42:16.383
- No.
- Ugh.

42:16.416 --> 42:17.718
Drank it all.

42:17.751 --> 42:18.418
- I know.
- Sorry.

42:18.450 --> 42:19.952
Three.

42:21.354 --> 42:22.989
Ugh! Okay.

42:23.021 --> 42:23.855
All right.
Two out of three.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.191
Two out of three.
Two out of three.

42:25.224 --> 42:27.126
- Okay? One. Two. Three.
- One. Two. Three.

42:27.994 --> 42:29.196
Oh my God!

42:31.530 --> 42:32.898
Stupid game.
[phone ringing]

42:32.932 --> 42:35.202
Cause you're losing.
That's why it's stupid.

42:38.104 --> 42:39.239
<i>Hello?</i>

42:40.372 --> 42:42.208
<i>Yes.
Yes, this is she.</i>

42:44.910 --> 42:46.412
<i>He's my son!</i>

42:47.247 --> 42:49.149
<i>No! No!</i>

42:50.517 --> 42:53.053
<i>What do you mean
you can't locate him?</i>

42:54.019 --> 42:55.956
- They can't find Kelly.
- Let me talk to them.

42:55.988 --> 42:57.157
- Stop.
- Mom!

42:57.189 --> 42:59.425
- Stop. No.
- Let me talk to them, okay?

43:01.160 --> 43:03.764
Yeah.
This is Max Rhodes.

43:03.796 --> 43:05.164
Kelly's brother.

43:05.932 --> 43:07.868
<i>When... When was the last time
that you saw him?</i>

43:09.001 --> 43:10.737
<i>Uh-huh. Yeah.</i>

43:11.371 --> 43:12.740
<i>What?</i>

43:59.852 --> 44:01.053
Hey.

44:34.486 --> 44:36.055
<i>...in Manhattan,
the phone lines are down</i>

44:36.088 --> 44:37.824
<i>and we can't reach
any additional...</i>

44:56.008 --> 44:57.276
<i>...declare the
United States,</i>

44:57.309 --> 44:58.611
<i>under martial law.</i>

44:58.644 --> 45:00.980
<i>The disaster relief aid
is on its way</i>

45:01.014 --> 45:03.249
<i>to unaffected areas
of our nation.</i>

45:03.282 --> 45:06.185
<i>And the WHO remains
relentless in the...</i>

45:06.218 --> 45:07.454
<i>Ava!</i>

45:09.988 --> 45:11.191
Mom?

45:11.557 --> 45:12.626
Mom, listen.
Mom?

45:12.659 --> 45:14.160
- Hm?
- Stay up.

45:14.193 --> 45:15.629
Grab some corn syrup.

45:16.662 --> 45:18.064
It's all right.

45:18.264 --> 45:19.532
Wait.

45:21.233 --> 45:23.469
Her blood sugar is crashing.
She's just not eating enough.

45:23.503 --> 45:24.470
- Come on.
- That's right.

45:24.503 --> 45:26.572
- A little corn syrup.
- Take a little more.

45:26.606 --> 45:28.175
There you go.
There you go.

45:28.707 --> 45:30.209
It's gonna be all right.

45:30.242 --> 45:31.911
Hey.

45:31.945 --> 45:32.646
Are you okay?

45:32.678 --> 45:33.646
Hey, how you doing?

45:33.680 --> 45:35.482
Don't. Shh.
Come on, Mom.

45:35.715 --> 45:39.119
<i>No. No!
I said no!</i>

45:39.151 --> 45:41.320
<i>We can't just do nothing!
It's too...</i>

45:46.392 --> 45:48.562
<i>I can't just sit around here.</i>

45:48.695 --> 45:51.231
<i>You know?
I have to at least try.</i>

46:23.061 --> 46:25.164
- Do not get into that truck!
- Mom.

46:25.197 --> 46:26.699
No.
Do not get in that truck.

46:26.733 --> 46:28.301
- No! No!
- We have to.

46:28.334 --> 46:30.203
You are not going!
You are not going!

46:30.235 --> 46:31.704
- Mom!
- You are not gonna die for me.

46:31.738 --> 46:33.340
Shh, shh!

46:33.372 --> 46:35.275
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Please?

46:35.307 --> 46:38.010
Please don't let him go.
Cause I can't be alone.

46:52.358 --> 46:53.994
It looks pretty quiet.

47:17.383 --> 47:18.618
What is that?

47:19.251 --> 47:20.619
I don't know.

47:46.144 --> 47:47.646
See what happened, Bob?

47:49.682 --> 47:51.284
Just got here.

47:54.586 --> 47:55.220
Max!

47:55.255 --> 47:56.756
Amanda!
Get in the truck!

47:56.789 --> 47:58.557
You see this, Rhodes?

47:58.590 --> 48:00.325
This is what I'm talking about!

48:00.358 --> 48:02.496
It's what I've been
talking about the whole time!

48:03.396 --> 48:05.131
I hear your mom's
not doing too good.

48:05.164 --> 48:06.198
Max!

48:06.566 --> 48:08.201
Are you heading into town?

48:09.602 --> 48:11.304
Amanda, be smart.

48:15.140 --> 48:16.376
- Max!
- Keep your head down!

48:16.409 --> 48:17.110
Stop! Stop!

48:17.142 --> 48:17.976
Max! Max!
Hey!

48:18.010 --> 48:19.611
Let's go. We're going.
Get in the car.

48:19.644 --> 48:21.180
Amanda, please?

48:21.447 --> 48:23.249
Don't make that trip tonight.

48:32.157 --> 48:33.426
Come on, son.

50:03.282 --> 50:05.351
Max. Don't, don't.
Don't go out there. Don't.

50:05.383 --> 50:06.818
Okay. Okay.
I won't.

50:06.852 --> 50:07.821
<i>Max!</i>

50:10.990 --> 50:12.592
<i>Max!</i>

50:15.528 --> 50:16.629
Get the hell
off my property.

50:16.662 --> 50:18.430
<i>Is Amanda in there?</i>

50:21.633 --> 50:23.336
What do you want?

50:24.269 --> 50:25.804
<i>I found some insulin.</i>

50:28.307 --> 50:29.409
<i>If you get in
the truck with me,</i>

50:29.441 --> 50:31.477
<i>I'll leave it out here
for them.</i>

50:31.910 --> 50:33.679
<i>Look, we don't have
power like you do,</i>

50:33.713 --> 50:36.783
<i>so the sooner you get it
into your fridge the better.</i>

50:40.352 --> 50:41.954
- No.
- Max.

50:42.854 --> 50:44.356
<i>Amanda?</i>

50:44.389 --> 50:45.791
<i>You belong with your family.</i>

50:45.825 --> 50:47.561
No you don't.

50:49.494 --> 50:51.597
Max, we have to.
Your mom.

50:51.863 --> 50:54.568
It'll be at the house
when you change your mind.

51:04.043 --> 51:05.678
We're gonna be okay.

51:10.282 --> 51:11.650
Hey. Hey.

51:11.983 --> 51:13.852
We'll find another way.

51:14.887 --> 51:16.990
She's gonna be okay.

51:23.061 --> 51:24.796
<i>Max?</i>

51:24.829 --> 51:26.331
<i>Who's here?</i>

51:26.365 --> 51:28.001
I promise.

51:32.371 --> 51:33.740
Mom?

52:01.867 --> 52:03.570
Ava? Ava!

52:07.372 --> 52:09.541
No! No!

52:10.910 --> 52:12.379
Max! Max!
Hey!

52:12.945 --> 52:14.314
Look at me.
Look at me.

52:14.347 --> 52:14.981
Stay with me.

52:16.048 --> 52:17.517
Look at me.
Look at me.

52:17.617 --> 52:19.285
Hey!
Oh my God.

52:20.619 --> 52:22.722
Shh.
Stay with me.

52:22.755 --> 52:25.892
Hey.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52:25.925 --> 52:27.360
- You're okay.
- The work is done.

52:27.392 --> 52:28.894
Don't!
Don't kill him!

52:28.927 --> 52:29.895
Stop!

52:29.928 --> 52:31.764
- Don't!
- Stop! It's okay.

52:31.796 --> 52:32.798
You're killing him.

52:32.831 --> 52:34.633
Shh!
Stop it.

52:34.666 --> 52:37.369
- It's too-It's too late!
- No!

52:45.410 --> 52:46.646
I didn't know.

52:46.678 --> 52:48.481
I swear to God,
I didn't know.

52:48.514 --> 52:49.983
Are you okay?

52:51.050 --> 52:52.452
Let's get her in.

52:52.485 --> 52:53.787
Let's get her in the house.

52:54.686 --> 52:55.921
Fuck you!

52:55.954 --> 52:58.457
You! You!
No! No!

52:58.490 --> 52:59.659
<i>Max!</i>

52:59.691 --> 53:01.026
<i>Max!</i>

53:02.427 --> 53:03.662
- Get off!
- <i>Where's my son?</i>

53:03.695 --> 53:04.831
Get off!

53:04.863 --> 53:05.631
<i>Where's my son?!</i>

53:05.664 --> 53:07.534
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Where's my son!</i>

53:08.867 --> 53:09.601
<i>No!</i>

53:10.168 --> 53:11.704
<i>No!</i>

54:35.621 --> 54:37.090
<i>She ain't here!</i>

56:10.582 --> 56:11.684
Stop!

56:11.983 --> 56:13.119
Stop!

56:13.751 --> 56:15.320
Stop! Stop!

56:15.354 --> 56:16.689
Please stop!

56:16.722 --> 56:18.157
No! No!

56:26.999 --> 56:27.900
Go!
Go, go, go!

56:27.932 --> 56:29.135
Go, go!

56:38.776 --> 56:39.912
You have to help me.

56:41.280 --> 56:43.149
I need to see a doctor.

56:45.316 --> 56:46.251
Let me out.
Stop the car.

56:46.285 --> 56:47.754
Stop. Stop!

56:51.789 --> 56:52.791
Please!

56:52.825 --> 56:54.093
Don't leave me!

56:55.827 --> 56:56.896
Just drive me there!

56:56.928 --> 56:58.631
- Sorry, I can't. I can't help you!
- Please!

56:58.664 --> 57:00.566
- I can't help you!
- Please!

57:00.898 --> 57:02.167
I'm sorry.

57:09.907 --> 57:11.610
Don't move!

57:12.043 --> 57:14.079
Don't touch anything!

57:17.048 --> 57:18.784
You're okay!

57:19.885 --> 57:21.588
Hang on!

57:22.253 --> 57:23.922
Be right there.

57:24.222 --> 57:26.291
It's gonna be okay.
Calm down.

57:27.892 --> 57:29.762
You're fine.
We're gonna take this off.

57:31.796 --> 57:33.398
Take this off.
Slow down.

57:33.432 --> 57:34.968
Slow down.

57:35.968 --> 57:38.004
Okay?
Grab this.

57:40.372 --> 57:42.041
Okay.

57:42.073 --> 57:43.943
It's okay.
I got you.

57:45.943 --> 57:47.313
All right.

57:47.345 --> 57:49.414
I need you to hold out
your collar, all right?

57:49.447 --> 57:50.849
Just the collar.

57:50.883 --> 57:52.752
Stretch it out.
Out, out, out.

57:53.751 --> 57:55.121
Good.

57:55.354 --> 57:56.889
Good, all right.

57:59.023 --> 58:00.359
It's okay.

58:05.731 --> 58:07.200
All right.

58:10.035 --> 58:11.371
Come on!

58:17.242 --> 58:20.246
<i>You're not gonna get
very far dressed like that.</i>

58:58.784 --> 59:00.253
<i>Amanda, open the door!</i>

59:14.166 --> 59:15.267
<i>You want out?</i>

59:16.267 --> 59:17.403
<i>Come here!
Come here!</i>

59:41.894 --> 59:42.995
You see what
you're making me do?

59:43.028 --> 59:44.863
You think I wanna
be this way?

59:49.334 --> 59:51.169
I'm not the bad guy.

59:54.039 --> 59:56.275
<i>Stop putting us all at risk!</i>

59:58.910 --> 1:00:00.246
Dig in there, everybody.

1:00:38.349 --> 1:00:40.819
There was something
in my throat.

1:00:43.121 --> 1:00:44.356
Adam, would you go
get some firewood?

1:00:44.389 --> 1:00:46.025
The stove is low.

1:00:47.025 --> 1:00:48.260
Yep.

1:00:48.293 --> 1:00:49.561
Thanks.

1:02:17.983 --> 1:02:19.318
<i>We've gotta go.</i>

1:02:24.189 --> 1:02:26.325
<i>C'mon.
It's gonna be dark soon.</i>

1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:03.362
Jake?

1:03:13.572 --> 1:03:15.006
Hey.

1:03:25.751 --> 1:03:27.320
You ready?

1:03:28.119 --> 1:03:29.220
Yeah.

1:03:34.593 --> 1:03:36.162
It looks like it hurts.

1:03:37.528 --> 1:03:39.130
It's fine.

1:03:40.564 --> 1:03:42.034
- It's fine?
- Yeah.

1:03:42.066 --> 1:03:44.269
- Yeah?
- It's totally fine.

1:03:46.738 --> 1:03:48.541
You don't have to
pretend with me.

1:03:49.673 --> 1:03:51.276
I know you're tough.

1:03:54.412 --> 1:03:56.581
Hey, did you think
about what I asked?

1:04:00.619 --> 1:04:02.321
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:04:05.657 --> 1:04:08.327
And?

1:04:09.561 --> 1:04:11.430
I don't think
we'd get very far.

1:04:13.131 --> 1:04:14.767
Why not?

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:16.568
I think we'd make
a great team.

1:04:18.769 --> 1:04:20.238
Back.

1:04:35.287 --> 1:04:36.789
Don't you think so?

1:04:40.092 --> 1:04:41.760
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:04:44.361 --> 1:04:46.599
We could take care
of each other, you know?

1:04:49.834 --> 1:04:51.704
Don't you want that?

1:04:54.840 --> 1:04:56.542
Yeah.

1:05:03.180 --> 1:05:04.717
What are you doing?

1:05:05.717 --> 1:05:07.485
I think we should go.

1:05:12.456 --> 1:05:14.459
We should go
before they get back.

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:18.296
We should go tomorrow.

1:05:22.334 --> 1:05:24.537
- Ava?
- Come on. Let's go.

1:05:26.570 --> 1:05:28.139
Come on.

1:05:29.807 --> 1:05:31.709
Hurry.
Let's go right now.

1:05:32.711 --> 1:05:34.246
We could just go tomorrow.

1:05:34.278 --> 1:05:35.814
What's wrong with
right now?

1:06:18.356 --> 1:06:19.792
Take your boots off.

1:06:20.858 --> 1:06:22.627
- What?
- Take your boots off.

1:06:22.660 --> 1:06:23.896
- My boots?
- Take your...

1:06:23.928 --> 1:06:25.363
Why?

1:07:33.564 --> 1:07:35.434
<i>Hey, Jake!
Grab me a beer.</i>

1:07:42.773 --> 1:07:44.242
<i>Jake!</i>

1:07:48.613 --> 1:07:50.216
Fucking worthless.

1:07:56.488 --> 1:07:57.756
Jake!

1:08:27.451 --> 1:08:28.286
Ah!

1:08:31.388 --> 1:08:32.390
Shh.

1:08:35.026 --> 1:08:36.762
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:08:36.795 --> 1:08:37.796
All right.

1:08:37.829 --> 1:08:39.598
Things are gonna change.

1:08:39.630 --> 1:08:41.532
Everybody's gonna
do their part.

1:08:41.566 --> 1:08:42.701
Shh.

1:08:42.733 --> 1:08:44.335
Calm down.
Shh.

1:08:52.076 --> 1:08:54.545
Calm down!

1:08:59.817 --> 1:09:01.320
Oh!

1:09:02.420 --> 1:09:03.689
Oh!

1:09:03.722 --> 1:09:06.025
Agh! Ow!

1:09:58.509 --> 1:09:59.744
Ava!

1:10:01.545 --> 1:10:03.381
What the hell are you doing?

1:10:04.682 --> 1:10:06.485
I can't stay here.

1:10:12.991 --> 1:10:14.426
Fine!
You wanna go so bad?

1:10:14.459 --> 1:10:16.027
Get the fuck out of here!

1:10:16.059 --> 1:10:17.562
Jake, come on.

1:10:17.594 --> 1:10:18.496
Leave!

1:10:37.482 --> 1:10:38.684
<i>Ava!</i>

1:10:40.151 --> 1:10:41.854
Ah!

1:10:43.888 --> 1:10:45.157
<i>Jake, stop!</i>

1:10:51.094 --> 1:10:52.563
<i>Jake, stop it!</i>

1:10:56.733 --> 1:10:57.769
Jake, stop!

1:11:12.150 --> 1:11:13.518
Ava?

1:11:15.620 --> 1:11:17.089
Max?

1:16:05.343 --> 1:16:06.912
Ava! Run!

1:16:07.344 --> 1:16:08.213
Go!
Just go!

1:16:08.245 --> 1:16:09.880
Look what I got!

1:16:09.914 --> 1:16:11.816
- Came an awful long way!
- Ava, listen to me.

1:16:11.848 --> 1:16:13.050
- See this?
- No. Don't.

1:16:13.084 --> 1:16:14.786
You're gonna show me
where my guns are.

1:16:14.818 --> 1:16:16.521
I'll... I'll give you
the guns back, okay?

1:16:16.554 --> 1:16:17.589
Uh, just don't hurt him.

1:16:17.621 --> 1:16:20.157
- Ava, I am fine. I'm fine.
- Shut up! Shut up!

1:16:20.191 --> 1:16:21.860
Okay! Okay!

1:16:21.893 --> 1:16:23.328
We're gonna take
a little walk!

1:16:24.262 --> 1:16:26.164
Ava, listen to me.
You don't show him anything.

1:16:28.265 --> 1:16:29.299
Get up!
Let's go.

1:16:29.332 --> 1:16:30.768
No, no, no...

1:16:30.802 --> 1:16:32.437
Please, just help him out.

1:16:32.469 --> 1:16:34.104
I'll get the guns.
I'll bring them back.

1:16:34.138 --> 1:16:36.041
Just don't hurt him,
please.

1:16:41.978 --> 1:16:44.048
You bring them
back here by morning,

1:16:45.249 --> 1:16:47.219
or I will shoot him
in the head!

1:16:48.486 --> 1:16:49.821
Okay.

1:16:51.222 --> 1:16:52.456
Get up!

1:16:55.393 --> 1:16:56.861
Ava!

1:16:56.893 --> 1:16:58.896
- Ava, don't!
- Get off your ass and help me!

1:17:03.835 --> 1:17:05.103
Pick him up!

1:20:26.536 --> 1:20:28.106
Where's Kelly?

1:20:29.506 --> 1:20:31.375
You need to hold up
your end of the bargain.

1:20:31.409 --> 1:20:33.111
Tell me where he is!

1:20:34.411 --> 1:20:36.013
Come on.
Shoot me.

1:20:40.550 --> 1:20:42.687
Then how will you
find him then?

1:20:45.589 --> 1:20:47.425
You want your guns?

1:20:48.159 --> 1:20:49.727
Yes.

1:20:49.759 --> 1:20:51.195
Yes, I do.

1:20:52.062 --> 1:20:54.231
You want this gun?
You can have it.

1:20:54.497 --> 1:20:55.666
Amanda?

1:20:56.500 --> 1:20:58.370
Hold on.
Shh, shh, shh.

1:21:01.205 --> 1:21:03.107
You killed him,
didn't you?

1:21:03.139 --> 1:21:04.709
No, I didn't.

1:21:05.308 --> 1:21:06.710
I don't believe you.

1:21:06.744 --> 1:21:09.546
Just show me
where they are.

1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:11.683
I'll... I'll take
you to Kelly myself.

1:21:14.151 --> 1:21:15.653
It's nice and simple.

1:21:16.687 --> 1:21:19.357
It's okay. Shh.

1:21:19.389 --> 1:21:20.392
It's okay.

1:21:21.125 --> 1:21:22.227
Shh.

1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:24.595
It's okay.

1:21:25.463 --> 1:21:28.066
It's gonna be just fine.
Shh.

1:21:28.098 --> 1:21:29.199
I got you.

1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:31.535
I got you.

1:21:32.469 --> 1:21:34.438
Come on.
Come on.

1:21:35.371 --> 1:21:36.740
I got you.

1:21:37.241 --> 1:21:38.343
It's okay.

1:21:39.276 --> 1:21:40.678
It's all right.

1:21:42.879 --> 1:21:44.515
It's okay.

1:21:52.723 --> 1:21:54.225
Come on.

1:22:10.573 --> 1:22:12.242
Turn around.

1:22:13.811 --> 1:22:15.280
No.

1:22:15.513 --> 1:22:17.215
You turn the fuck around.

1:22:20.518 --> 1:22:22.153
What are you gonna do?

1:22:22.385 --> 1:22:23.620
Shoot me?

1:22:39.536 --> 1:22:41.606
Did you look my brother in
the eye before you killed him?

1:22:41.638 --> 1:22:43.240
I didn't kill him.

1:22:43.273 --> 1:22:45.343
I bet you looked away.

1:22:45.375 --> 1:22:46.910
Didn't you?

1:22:46.943 --> 1:22:48.312
You did.

1:22:50.180 --> 1:22:52.150
You did.
You looked away.

1:22:55.952 --> 1:22:57.856
You're gonna look me
in the eye.

1:23:00.790 --> 1:23:02.159
Do it!

1:23:07.665 --> 1:23:09.501
Agh!

1:23:19.410 --> 1:23:20.879
They're under there.

1:23:28.318 --> 1:23:29.720
That's my girl.

1:23:31.655 --> 1:23:33.323
Where's Kelly?

1:23:34.325 --> 1:23:36.260
He's right next
to his family.

1:23:37.561 --> 1:23:39.764
But you already
guessed that.

1:23:39.796 --> 1:23:41.432
Didn't you?

1:23:43.701 --> 1:23:45.436
Agh!

1:23:45.469 --> 1:23:47.472
Fuck! Fuck!

1:23:48.339 --> 1:23:50.274
Goddammit, Amanda!

1:23:50.307 --> 1:23:51.742
Come on, just let...
Damn it!

1:23:52.710 --> 1:23:55.880
Amanda, you stupid bitch!
Get me out of this trap!

1:23:58.014 --> 1:24:00.517
Amanda, sweetie?
I know you're mad.

1:24:00.550 --> 1:24:01.919
I know you're confused.

1:24:01.951 --> 1:24:03.853
But come here
and help me.

1:24:03.887 --> 1:24:05.389
Now.

1:24:08.992 --> 1:24:11.228
Amanda, quit fucking around!

1:24:14.397 --> 1:24:15.665
This isn't you.

1:24:15.698 --> 1:24:17.902
You're sick
and you need help.

1:24:17.934 --> 1:24:19.536
I can help you.

1:24:20.504 --> 1:24:21.872
What are you doing?

1:24:24.575 --> 1:24:26.744
All right. All right.
All right.

1:24:26.777 --> 1:24:28.412
You've proved your point.

1:24:28.445 --> 1:24:29.914
No.

1:24:29.946 --> 1:24:32.616
No, no, no.
Are you fucking nuts?

1:24:32.650 --> 1:24:33.951
Amanda!

1:24:34.652 --> 1:24:36.354
Amanda, let me out!

1:24:36.987 --> 1:24:38.456
Let me out!

1:24:38.488 --> 1:24:39.756
Come on!

1:24:39.990 --> 1:24:41.960
I can't get out, Amanda!

1:24:45.763 --> 1:24:48.666
Hey. Hey. It's okay.
Come on.

1:24:48.698 --> 1:24:49.968
Come here.

1:24:50.601 --> 1:24:51.902
Come here.

1:24:53.670 --> 1:24:55.439
Stop.
Stop!

1:24:56.540 --> 1:24:58.576
Amanda!

1:24:58.608 --> 1:24:59.977
You can't leave me here!

1:25:00.009 --> 1:25:01.344
Don't you go!

1:25:01.378 --> 1:25:02.780
Amanda!

1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:11.840
Ava?
