00:54.988 --> 00:57.320
Um, so, anyway...

00:57.390 --> 00:59.915
thank you all so much
for being here and...

00:59.993 --> 01:03.485
<i>uh, let's eat some cake.</i>

01:14.541 --> 01:16.532
<i>Careful!</i>

01:19.179 --> 01:21.739
<i>- Ben, you're gonna drop me.
- I am gonna drop you.</i>

01:21.815 --> 01:24.807
God.

01:30.190 --> 01:33.182
- Mmm, stay just like that.
- Ben-

01:33.260 --> 01:36.752
<i>- Enough with the pictures!
- Come on!</i>

01:36.830 --> 01:39.663
You look beautiful!
They should be preserved for all of time.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.997
This is what I get
for marrying a photographer.

01:44.571 --> 01:49.304
What are you doing
so far away from me?

01:49.376 --> 01:52.868
The most beautiful blushing bride
in all of Brooklyn.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.880
Oh.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.012
You have been wonderful
about this whole thing.

02:00.086 --> 02:02.680
- Yes, I have been wonderful.
- Yes, you have.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.690
I promise you, I will make it fun.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.420
Just think, the first stamp
in your new passport is gonna be Japan.

02:07.494 --> 02:11.055
- How cool is that?
- That is cool. That is really cool.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.499
Well, the car will
be here in an hour.

02:16.569 --> 02:20.335
You better hurry up if you're gonna
get this thing consummated.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.280
God, look at that.

03:42.355 --> 03:46.291
- Mmm, it's beautiful, huh?
- It's gorgeous!

03:46.359 --> 03:48.327
Real quick. Get in the picture.

03:48.395 --> 03:52.058
Uh-oh.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.690
Ben.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.186
Baby, I'm sorry.
Can you check the map?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.854
I am so lost. I think-

04:23.930 --> 04:26.763
- Sorry to wake you up.
- Mmm, it's okay.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.373
<i>Did you cross a bridge?</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:39.173
- What was the last thing that you passed?
- Uh, this intersection about-

05:27.260 --> 05:30.229
Jane. Jane?

05:30.296 --> 05:32.025
Jane, honey, are you okay?

05:32.098 --> 05:34.032
There was a girl.
We hit a girl.

05:38.471 --> 05:41.463
<i>- There was a girl on the road.
- Okay. Okay.</i>

05:41.541 --> 05:44.101
I think she might be dead.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.611
- Jesus Christ.
- There's nothing here, Jane.

05:46.679 --> 05:50.206
- Oh, I might've killed someone.
- Janie, there's nothin' here.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.877
She could be covered in the snow.
Ben, we have to find her.

05:52.952 --> 05:56.547
- Janie, there's no blood. There's nothing here.
- We have to find her.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.023
Let me get you back in the car.
It is freezing out here.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.151
I'm gonna call the police.
I'll get us some help.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.150
- They can't just leave.
- Honey-

06:25.218 --> 06:29.018
They searched the woods.
They called the hospitals. There's nothing.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.955
They think we hit an animal.
You're absolutely positive that it was a girl?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.118
Ben, she was standing right here.

06:35.361 --> 06:38.797
Okay. Look, there's nothing else
we can do tonight.

06:38.865 --> 06:42.801
So can we please, please just go?

06:52.278 --> 06:55.247
Oh, man.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.687
Oh, man.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.693
I think I tweaked somethin'
back there.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.633
We did everything we could, Jane.

07:16.703 --> 07:21.106
<i>Look, we've only got a couple of days
before I start work. Let's try and enjoy it.</i>

07:22.175 --> 07:24.200
What do you say
I make us some green tea?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.609
And then we can sleep for a year.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.613
<i>Maybe two.</i>

07:28.681 --> 07:30.842
Yeah.

07:50.069 --> 07:53.630
<i>Janie, I forgot how beautiful
the light is out here.</i>

07:53.706 --> 07:57.369
We have got-
to start taking some pictures.

08:00.780 --> 08:05.149
What would a girl have been doing in the
middle of the road wearing a dress like that?

08:05.218 --> 08:08.915
<i>Jane, honey,
we have talked about this.</i>

08:08.988 --> 08:12.048
If there was a girl- If-

08:12.125 --> 08:14.525
Then somebody must have stopped
and got her some help.

08:14.594 --> 08:17.586
- I know. I just- I can't-
- Jane, please.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.598
Stop being so dramatic about this.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.600
If there was a girl,
I promise you...

08:21.668 --> 08:25.195
she is somewhere right now sitting in bed,
eating ice cream and having her cast signed.

08:25.271 --> 08:28.035
Come with me, and let's take some photographs.

08:30.309 --> 08:34.268
- Baby, do they even have ice cream in Japan?
- Yes, they do.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.371
- But... it's fish flavored.
- Oh, okay.

08:36.448 --> 08:41.182
Right- No, no. Right-
Perfect. One second.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.451
- Ben, it's really cold.
- I know. I'm comin'.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.685
Okay, okay.
First, one for Mom.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.351
<i>A family portrait.</i>

08:49.862 --> 08:51.523
Can I press the button?

08:51.597 --> 08:53.121
- You wanna press the button?
- I wanna press the button.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.170
<i>- That's why they pay me the big bucks.
- Jane is cold.</i>

08:58.237 --> 08:59.032
<i>- Jane's cold.</i>

08:59.033 --> 09:01.229
- We should definitely,
definitely warm Jane up.

09:25.164 --> 09:26.153
<i>Ben-san!</i>

09:28.801 --> 09:31.292
Yoko.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.006
Yoko.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.341
- Oh.
- Hi.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.177
Wife?

09:43.249 --> 09:46.013
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.918
- And congratulations on the job.
- Thank you.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.922
<i>Ben-san!</i>

09:50.990 --> 09:52.981
- See ya.
- Bruno! Look at you!

09:53.059 --> 09:55.755
- Oh!
- Two years!

09:55.828 --> 09:57.762
- Like you never left.
- Maybe I shouldn't have.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.128
Oh, come on. Come on.
This must be Jane.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.326
Uh, yes. Bruno, Jane.
Jane, Bruno.

10:02.401 --> 10:04.335
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

10:04.403 --> 10:07.167
- Sorry I couldn't make it, but-
- Oh, Ben's told me so much about you.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.800
Oh, hopefully the good stuff.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.538
And I'm sorry we cut short
your honeymoon.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.103
In fact, I got the client
upstairs waiting.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.411
- Oh, don't worry about me. Go.
- Okay.

10:19.018 --> 10:19.646
<i>- Good luck.</i>

10:19.647 --> 10:21.782
- I'm sorry I'm late, man.
The traffic was a killer.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.322
<i>Don't worry about it.
You're the genius photographer.</i>

10:24.390 --> 10:27.826
<i>That's why I brought you out here.</i>

10:31.898 --> 10:35.334
We finalized the last of the models.
Did you get the Polaroids we sent over?

10:35.401 --> 10:38.131
I did get the Polaroids. There's a couple
I'd like to meet in person.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.195
- Yeah, I bet there is.
- Oh, come on.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.605
Talk to Adam about that tomorrow.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.905
Now, the clients are eager to get going.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.845
And I think I should mention they are
very pleased with our choice of photographer.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.042
- You ready?
- Ready.

11:11.237 --> 11:15.731
So, it's a loft conversion, but it's much nicer
on the inside. No, no. Let me get that.

11:17.810 --> 11:21.507
All the comforts of home.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.572
Right this way.

11:25.651 --> 11:29.519
<i>Ah. Here is the photo studio.</i>

11:29.589 --> 11:31.523
<i>Come on in.</i>

11:37.763 --> 11:40.527
Hi! Pleasure to meet you.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.933
Yes, this is your assistant.
Ben Shaw, Seiko Nakamura.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.972
And this is Ben's wife, Jane.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.234
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.367
<i>- Does this work?
- Yeah.</i>

11:51.444 --> 11:53.810
Let me show you
the darkroom over here...

11:53.880 --> 11:55.905
for the black-and-white prints.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.677
Yeah? Will it work?

12:02.755 --> 12:05.485
<i>- It's good?
- Yeah, yeah. Better than good.</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:08.652
Good. All right. Well, let's head upstairs,
and we'll check out the rest.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.755
<i>- People live here?
- Well, yours is the only actual completed unit.</i>

12:12.832 --> 12:15.232
So, you guys'll have
the whole place to yourselves.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.064
Be good for a couple
of newlyweds, huh?

12:24.944 --> 12:29.313
We had, uh, most of this stuff
from another shoot.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.442
<i>- Figured they wouldn't miss it.
- You always were a sneaky bastard.</i>

12:33.753 --> 12:35.744
<i>I had, uh, Seiko rent the rest.</i>

12:36.989 --> 12:39.787
<i>- Not so bad, right?
- Are you kidding? It's great.</i>

12:41.961 --> 12:43.895
Look at this place.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.335
<i>- Our stuff.
- I gotta get back to the office.</i>

12:51.404 --> 12:53.235
Man, you set us up here.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.297
I want you to know
I really appreciate this job.

12:55.374 --> 12:58.502
Come on. You make me look good,
you being here.

12:58.577 --> 13:02.638
Besides, it'll just be like old times.

13:02.715 --> 13:06.014
<i>- Don't forget. Dinner with Adam.
- Sounds good to me.</i>

13:06.085 --> 13:07.609
All right. Good night.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.788
<i>It's huge!</i>

13:11.857 --> 13:16.021
- My God!
- And it's all ours!

13:16.095 --> 13:18.495
I mean, Janie,
did you see this view of Tokyo?

13:18.564 --> 13:20.361
<i>I wish I'd brought up my camera.</i>

13:20.433 --> 13:24.392
<i>Well, too bad there is nothing else
that we could do...</i>

13:25.738 --> 13:28.104
up here.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.312
Mr. Ben Shaw.

13:41.954 --> 13:45.117
<i>#All these things I say #</i>

13:46.325 --> 13:50.227
<i># The way you make me feel #</i>

13:50.296 --> 13:53.265
<i># All these things I say #</i>

13:53.332 --> 13:55.357
<i># You are #</i>

13:55.434 --> 13:58.369
<i># Good to me #</i>

13:58.437 --> 14:00.405
<i># You are #</i>

14:00.473 --> 14:03.340
<i># Good to me #</i>

14:03.409 --> 14:04.876
<i># You are #</i>

14:04.944 --> 14:07.242
<i># Good to me ##</i>

15:01.067 --> 15:03.399
You gotta get that looked at, honey.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.267
What's this?

15:10.342 --> 15:12.310
Just a little surprise.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.246
It's the honeymoon photographs.
I gave Bruno the film last night.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.148
Seiko just dropped them off.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.087
Oh, God, I look hideous.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.421
What's this?

15:29.695 --> 15:31.925
I don't know.
Reflection, maybe?

15:31.997 --> 15:34.363
Or it could just be
a bad frame on the roll.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.459
- No, it's in a couple of 'em.
- Really? Hmm.

15:38.504 --> 15:41.962
Maybe I misloaded the film.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.169
Well, if that's the case,
then we'll just have to reshoot.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.472
Mmm.

15:46.545 --> 15:49.446
Enjoy your first day in Tokyo.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.823
<i>Open your eyes. Just like that.</i>

16:36.896 --> 16:39.330
Hold that. Hold it.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.366
<i>Just like that.
Eyes to me.</i>

16:41.433 --> 16:43.367
Just like that.
Eyes to me.

16:43.435 --> 16:46.529
Can you drop your hand off the bottle
just a little- Right there. Perfect.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.072
<i>Hold that. Last couple.</i>

16:49.742 --> 16:53.109
Lovely. Uh, perfect.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.239
Okay. Can you bring your hand down
just a little bit on the bottle?

16:56.315 --> 16:58.044
A little more, more, more.
Okay. Right there, perfect.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.017
<i>Hold that.
Last couple frames.</i>

17:07.492 --> 17:09.426
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

17:09.494 --> 17:13.192
Can you show me how to get to-
I'm looking for, uh-

17:34.486 --> 17:38.820
<i>Super Lucky!</i>

18:00.879 --> 18:02.813
Sorry. Sorry.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.217
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.225
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

18:14.293 --> 18:17.160
- How was your first day in Tokyo?
- Uh, it was, um-

18:17.229 --> 18:19.493
- Mmm.
- Good. Rainy.

18:19.565 --> 18:22.500
Yeah, you're soaked.
Let's get you out of this.

18:22.568 --> 18:23.221
- Thank you.

18:23.222 --> 18:26.595
- Megan called. She's sending
over the photos from the wedding.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.833
Oh, that's nice.
I should give her a call.

18:28.907 --> 18:32.536
You could,
but it's 3:00 a.m. in New York.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.079
- Yesterday.
- Oh. Mmm.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.513
- How was your day?
- It's... the office.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.381
This'll only take a second.
Thank you.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.580
<i>- Moshi moshi.
- So, where'd you go?</i>

18:43.656 --> 18:47.319
- Uh, mostly I just walked around.
- Can I see your pictures?

18:47.393 --> 18:50.191
Sure. They're just tourist shots.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.322
Oh, God.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.197
What?

19:02.241 --> 19:04.675
Spirit photos.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.478
Hold on.
You know wh-what these are?

19:09.548 --> 19:13.245
Yeah. My ex-boyfriend works
at a spirit photography magazine.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.982
- There are whole magazines?
- Yeah.

19:17.056 --> 19:20.753
Any in English?

19:20.826 --> 19:23.727
Um, I can introduce you tomorrow, uh,
after the photo shoot.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.821
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- Um-

19:25.898 --> 19:28.025
That's cute.
You girls have a date.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.695
- Uh-Well, I guess so.
- Great.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.874
Hey. Ah!

19:41.880 --> 19:43.404
- Jane.
- Long time.

19:43.482 --> 19:47.350
<i>- Adam, this is my Jane. Jane, Adam.
- Hello. I'm Adam.</i>

19:47.419 --> 19:49.353
- Lovely to meet you.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.726
<i>- Look at you. You look like an old man.
- Bite me.</i>

19:56.795 --> 20:00.424
- Yeah, a cane or something there, buddy?
- I got your cane right here.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.967
- Um, sake?
- Sounds great. Sure.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.559
<i>Hai.</i>

20:04.636 --> 20:08.094
So, what do you do when you're not
traveling the world with this guy?

20:08.173 --> 20:10.607
Actually, I just became certified
to teach sixth-grade English.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.769
Really?
Well, that must be pretty fulfilling.

20:12.845 --> 20:16.372
No, l-

20:20.352 --> 20:23.788
<i>So, hey, Bru, you remember that Russian
hostess from the other night?</i>

20:23.856 --> 20:25.721
- No.
- Yeah, I called her.

20:25.791 --> 20:29.022
She's comin' in
for an audition on Wednesday.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.289
- Unbelievable, this guy.
- Some things never change.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.457
Hey, it's my job.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.262
<i>- Arigato.
- Thank you.</i>

20:36.335 --> 20:38.895
- What is it exactly that you do, Adam?
- Um-

20:38.971 --> 20:42.498
I, um, I rep models.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.668
Um, and I got this guy all the girls
he's workin' with the next two weeks.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.338
Ah. You guys make quite the team,
don't you?

20:48.414 --> 20:49.591
<i>- Certainly did.</i>

20:49.592 --> 20:52.441
- Three amigos of the
international department.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.853
<i>- To good friends.
- Kanpai.</i>

21:00.359 --> 21:02.691
Just perfect.

21:02.761 --> 21:07.255
<i>Eyes right to lens. Perfect.</i>

21:07.332 --> 21:08.697
<i>Right there. Hold that.</i>

21:08.767 --> 21:10.701
Perfect. Okay. Hold that.

21:10.769 --> 21:15.331
<i>Emi, can you bring that pipe just...
six inches out from your mouth.</i>

21:15.407 --> 21:17.807
<i>No, out. Right.</i>

21:17.876 --> 21:21.243
Okay. That's enough color.
Let's shoot some black-and-white.

21:25.918 --> 21:29.854
See, uh, right up there? That's my office,
right up there in the corner.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.686
<i>- That's your office?
- Clear frame, please. Bruno!</i>

21:32.758 --> 21:34.692
- Yeah?
- Be plenty of time for that later.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.990
<i>All right.</i>

21:40.432 --> 21:42.730
<i>Clear the frame, please.</i>

21:54.480 --> 21:56.414
<i>You left me here.</i>

22:02.621 --> 22:04.919
- What did you say?
- What?

22:04.990 --> 22:06.651
What did you just say to me?

22:06.725 --> 22:08.090
Nothing.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.164
Okay. Here we go.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.395
Uh, Sandra, can you
bring your leg out a little bit?

22:17.469 --> 22:20.495
<i>Thank you.</i>

22:32.017 --> 22:35.282
The Japanese love
paranormal phenomena.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.618
- And your boyfriend works here.
- No.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.919
- Ritsuo is my ex-boyfriend.
- Oh.

22:39.992 --> 22:43.086
- He's dating Yukiko now.
- Oh.

22:45.163 --> 22:47.256
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>

22:52.638 --> 22:55.869
- Seiko?
- Ritsuo?

23:22.034 --> 23:26.767
Sorry. l- I was wondering if you could
tell me where you get your photos from.

23:26.838 --> 23:30.274
- Oh, he's a fake.
- Oh. Shh.

23:31.977 --> 23:36.107
Look. Our readers want to see scary photos.
And real ones are hard to find.

23:36.181 --> 23:38.945
So, it's not a big deal.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.951
Right, so none of this is real.

23:42.588 --> 23:46.752
I didn't say that. Look, I started
this magazine three years ago.

23:49.394 --> 23:52.625
<i>And this is the first photo
we ever published.</i>

23:54.833 --> 23:57.199
That's me in the photo.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.264
It was taken after my mother
had passed away.

24:07.846 --> 24:09.780
It's real.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.646
But that's just one picture.

24:15.687 --> 24:19.054
Come on.
I want to show you something.

24:44.449 --> 24:47.646
<i>We didn't fake these.</i>

24:57.162 --> 25:01.861
<i>You know, spirit photography
has been around since the 1800s-</i>

25:01.933 --> 25:04.367
<i>as long as photography itself.</i>

25:04.436 --> 25:08.702
All across the world,
these images have always appeared...

25:08.774 --> 25:11.334
<i>connecting us with the unseen.</i>

25:14.112 --> 25:17.604
<i>And I think they're trying
to tell us something.</i>

25:17.683 --> 25:19.378
Like what?

25:19.451 --> 25:21.510
Well, depends on the people
and the pictures.

25:23.388 --> 25:25.583
<i>Unrequited love.</i>

25:25.657 --> 25:29.218
<i>Maybe you've had an unfinished business
with a dead relative.</i>

25:29.294 --> 25:33.958
<i>Could be your father,
mother, children.</i>

25:34.032 --> 25:37.968
<i>- I've seen pictures where
living people have appeared.</i>

25:40.806 --> 25:43.707
I think it's a case of strong emotions
making themselves heard.

25:46.445 --> 25:49.539
<i>- Like a message.
- Yes.</i>

25:49.614 --> 25:54.574
<i>Think about it. Why all that effort
if you don't have something to say?</i>

26:18.176 --> 26:23.944
<i>You know, if you're interested,
we just did a big story on a local medium.</i>

26:25.383 --> 26:27.317
What?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.811
He's a powerful spiritualist.

26:30.889 --> 26:34.416
We had him take a look
at a bunch of photos. Here.

26:36.161 --> 26:40.825
Does this mean that you can't tell
which ones are real or which ones are fakes?

26:40.899 --> 26:43.868
I know that you can't fake a Polaroid.
There's no negative.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.863
You load the film,
you push a shutter.

26:51.676 --> 26:54.975
And out comes a photo.
How are you gonna fake that?

26:55.046 --> 26:59.506
<i>Maybe you should take a picture of your girlfriend.
My spirit doesn't really like her.</i>

26:59.584 --> 27:02.348
Well, then maybe I should
take pictures of you.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.385
<i>Hey, where are you going with that?</i>

27:08.460 --> 27:11.088
<i>Ritsuo.</i>

28:13.191 --> 28:15.022
Ow!

28:26.905 --> 28:28.839
<i>Hello.</i>

28:28.907 --> 28:33.139
Hey.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.907
- Is everything okay?
- Uh-

28:38.416 --> 28:40.646
Uh, yeah.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.048
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everything's fine. I just- I, um-

28:45.123 --> 28:48.286
I got some chemicals in my eyes.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.833
Sorry.

30:06.905 --> 30:08.930
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

30:09.007 --> 30:13.501
Please, can somebody make it stop?
Does anyone know how to-

30:13.578 --> 30:17.241
I need to get back.
Please, somebody help!

30:29.761 --> 30:33.492
<i>Tell me it's not my fault.
Tell me that they damaged it at the lab.</i>

30:33.565 --> 30:35.658
<i>They looked. It's on the negatives.</i>

30:35.734 --> 30:38.032
<i>Then why didn't we
see anything in the Polaroids?</i>

30:38.103 --> 30:40.401
<i>Then they must have damaged it
at the lab!</i>

30:44.843 --> 30:49.712
- Just tell me this is not my fault.
- Hey.

30:51.249 --> 30:53.274
What's going on?

30:54.586 --> 30:56.781
The film from today's shoot
is ruined.

30:59.157 --> 31:01.455
Okay, I'm gonna go.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.696
- Bye, Jane.
- Bye.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.002
How bad is it?
Can you reshoot?

31:18.076 --> 31:21.375
No. Not without blowing the budget
and the schedule.

31:21.446 --> 31:23.414
- That's if they'd even let me.
- It was a mistake.

31:23.481 --> 31:26.075
- These things happen.
- Yes, it was.

31:26.151 --> 31:29.416
<i>A very embarrassing,
very expensive mistake.</i>

31:36.661 --> 31:38.595
<i>We've seen this before.</i>

31:38.663 --> 31:40.460
Like the pictures from the cabin.

31:41.966 --> 31:43.900
Well, it makes sense.
It's the same camera.

31:43.968 --> 31:46.766
It must've got
banged up in the crash.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.931
And, uh, somethin' got in the body,
or there's a light leak.

31:49.007 --> 31:51.032
I don't know. But I'm lucky
I didn't get fired today.

31:51.109 --> 31:54.476
- If it wasn't for Bruno-
- I saw her.

31:56.147 --> 31:58.138
<i>Who?</i>

31:58.216 --> 32:01.310
The girl from the road.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.985
She followed us to Tokyo.

32:07.058 --> 32:09.117
Well, great, great.
That means she's okay.

32:09.194 --> 32:14.131
No, she's- She's not-
She's not okay, Ben. Christ, she-

32:17.235 --> 32:19.226
I think she's dead.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.903
Janie.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.741
Janie, look. I know that this
has been difficult for you.

32:28.813 --> 32:32.681
- And it's completely understandable given-
- I know. I know. I know.

32:32.750 --> 32:37.380
I know what it sounds like.
I know it sounds crazy. But just think about it.

32:38.623 --> 32:43.651
Ben, have you seen
or felt anything strange?

32:43.728 --> 32:45.821
Anything at all.
Anything since the crash.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.491
Jane, I haven't seen any ghosts.

32:48.566 --> 32:51.558
- Don't be like that.
- But that's what this is about, right?

32:51.636 --> 32:54.127
I mean, that's what you're saying.
Listen to yourself.

32:54.205 --> 32:56.400
Do you hear what
you're saying, Jane? Ghosts?

32:56.474 --> 32:59.602
I mean, look. I wish I could
quit my job. I do.

32:59.677 --> 33:03.408
I wish I could spend every moment
of every day with you, but I can't.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.642
- I have to work.
- I've never asked you to hold my hand.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.742
- I've never asked you-
- But, Jane, that's what this is about!

33:07.819 --> 33:10.686
Now, come on!
Today is just not the day. I'm sorry.

33:10.755 --> 33:13.849
I'm sorry, Jane, but, Jesus,
I'm just not your fucking father.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.100
God.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.277
I see no sign of serious injury.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.449
I can give you something for the pain.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.850
Honey, I'm really sorry about last night.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.820
That's probably the agency.

36:05.897 --> 36:09.333
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

36:09.400 --> 36:12.733
<i>- Moshi moshi.
- Hi. It's me.</i>

36:15.006 --> 36:18.498
Hey, let's not fight anymore.
I'm sorry about the whole thing.

36:18.576 --> 36:21.409
Well, I was thinking
I'd make you dinner.

36:29.220 --> 36:31.711
Ben? Are you there?

37:16.067 --> 37:19.468
<i>No! God!</i>

37:28.646 --> 37:29.943
Ben!

37:48.366 --> 37:50.493
Ben?

38:11.189 --> 38:13.817
Ben?

38:19.030 --> 38:22.898
I'm so sorry.
Honey, I'm so sorry.

38:24.702 --> 38:27.637
You saw her.

38:27.705 --> 38:31.368
I think maybe the stress is gettin' to me.

38:31.442 --> 38:33.740
But you saw the girl.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.143
Seiko took me
to meet her ex-boyfriend.

38:43.221 --> 38:47.021
He told me that emotional energy
can be communicated on film.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.260
I know. I know.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.126
But all of your ruined photos?

38:53.197 --> 38:58.100
Everything that's happened-
I think it's that girl from the road.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.701
She's angry at me
for what I did to her.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.365
There's a man that people go to...

39:04.442 --> 39:06.876
to... cleanse their spirits.

39:06.944 --> 39:10.505
I think he should take a look at our pictures.

39:10.581 --> 39:13.675
- Jane, a fortuneteller?
- Please. I need you.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.846
What can it hurt?

39:27.698 --> 39:29.962
We can go in.

39:30.034 --> 39:33.902
We saw your article.

39:35.773 --> 39:39.140
Well, we wanted to know.
What are these?

39:44.649 --> 39:46.742
What are you?

39:46.817 --> 39:48.546
Not the skin.

39:48.619 --> 39:52.248
This is not us.

39:53.524 --> 39:56.152
We are spirit.

39:58.529 --> 40:01.657
Just alive.
The spirit is energy.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.165
When the body dies, the flesh rots.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.728
The spirit leaves,
but the energy remains.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.672
<i>Light is energy.</i>

40:13.744 --> 40:15.735
The camera catches light.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.776
That's how this works.

40:21.385 --> 40:24.786
But what makes them appear?

40:28.259 --> 40:29.920
Passion twists the spirit.

40:30.928 --> 40:36.127
Too much desire...
or love... or hate.

40:38.502 --> 40:42.962
The spirit becomes...
locked to the body.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.243
Trapped in death.

40:50.014 --> 40:54.178
Mr. Murase, we had an accident.

41:39.397 --> 41:41.331
- He's talkin' crazy.
- Wait, what is he saying?

41:41.399 --> 41:43.560
<i>- He's saying we're on our own.
- I think he's trying to help us.</i>

41:43.634 --> 41:45.329
<i>We're leaving. Come on!</i>

41:45.403 --> 41:47.200
Sorry.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.398
He said there's nothin' he can do.

41:49.473 --> 41:51.634
But why? Did he say anything
that can help us?

41:51.709 --> 41:55.702
The guy's a fake, a scam artist, okay?
We're wasting our time here.

41:55.780 --> 41:59.511
<i>Seiko. Hey, it's me.</i>

42:01.686 --> 42:03.119
Hey, everybody.
I'm sorry I'm late.

42:03.187 --> 42:06.281
I cannot talk about this right now.
Can we talk about it later?

42:06.357 --> 42:09.417
Okay? Later.
Sorry, everybody.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.506
<i>T.G.K.</i>

42:56.574 --> 42:59.304
Seiko?

42:59.376 --> 43:02.675
Do you guys have a-a Polaroid camera
that I could borrow?

45:38.636 --> 45:40.570
Where are you?

47:18.836 --> 47:21.066
<i>See you tomorrow at 8:00.</i>

47:21.138 --> 47:23.766
- See you tomorrow. Thanks for your help today.
- My pleasure.

47:49.633 --> 47:51.567
Oh!

48:04.081 --> 48:06.914
Hey, I'm still in here!

48:06.984 --> 48:09.544
Hello!

48:12.756 --> 48:16.487
Jane? Is that you?

48:16.560 --> 48:18.551
Shit.

48:18.629 --> 48:21.393
Look, this isn't funny anymore!
Turn on the lights.

48:30.074 --> 48:32.338
Hello?

48:52.696 --> 48:56.792
Who's there?
Who's there?

48:56.867 --> 48:58.596
Hey!

49:11.448 --> 49:14.110
You know who she is.

49:24.294 --> 49:26.285
Megumi was a translator.

49:26.363 --> 49:28.331
Good. Excuse me, miss.

49:28.398 --> 49:33.461
<i>Could you come forward a little bit
and just tuck in? All right.</i>

49:33.537 --> 49:36.165
<i>I don't think she'd ever
had a serious relationship before.</i>

49:39.576 --> 49:43.171
<i>Me, us, her job-</i>

49:43.247 --> 49:46.478
<i>they meant freedom
from her home life.</i>

49:46.550 --> 49:49.542
<i>- Her father was very traditional.
He didn't approve.</i>

49:49.620 --> 49:50.837
<i>- This is for you.</i>

49:50.838 --> 49:53.852
- She wanted to spend more
and more time at my place.

49:53.924 --> 49:58.486
<i>Oh, my God.
You really shouldn't have done this.</i>

49:58.562 --> 50:01.895
Her father died suddenly.
He'd been sick for a while.

50:04.368 --> 50:09.396
<i>- After that, she was different. Needy.
- Ben.</i>

50:09.473 --> 50:11.407
<i>I knew she was suffering,
but there was nothing I could do.</i>

50:11.475 --> 50:15.571
I just wasn't falling in love with her.
She sensed it.

50:15.646 --> 50:18.843
- It only made her more intense, obsessive.
- Ben.

50:18.916 --> 50:22.852
<i>Maybe I didn't understand
what our relationship meant to her...</i>

50:22.920 --> 50:25.445
<i>how much it cost her.</i>

50:25.522 --> 50:29.959
She was dangerous, Jane.
She was going to hurt someone- herself.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.257
- Don't leave me!
- Put that- Put it down!

50:32.329 --> 50:34.729
- This has got to stop. It has to stop.
- No!

50:34.798 --> 50:36.959
I can't do this anymore.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.797
<i>She wouldn't listen to me.</i>

50:38.869 --> 50:42.305
<i>She wouldn't leave me alone.</i>

50:42.372 --> 50:45.239
<i>She followed me everywhere.</i>

50:45.309 --> 50:48.710
<i>- Bruno and Adam said they'd talk to her.
- And?</i>

50:48.779 --> 50:54.274
And they told her to stop,
that it was over.

50:54.351 --> 50:57.445
That it was over,
that she was making a fool of herself.

50:57.521 --> 51:00.081
<i>After that, I never saw her again.</i>

51:00.157 --> 51:02.125
You just pushed her away.

51:02.192 --> 51:05.218
<i>- Janie, look, I know I didn't handle this well.
- But what was she doing there?</i>

51:05.295 --> 51:08.059
<i>- Why was she on that road?
- I don't know.</i>

51:08.131 --> 51:10.065
I don't know.
She must have been following me.

51:10.133 --> 51:13.000
<i>I know I should've told you...</i>

51:13.070 --> 51:15.561
but that's just not the easiest thing
to tell your new wife.

51:15.639 --> 51:18.574
But now,
Christ, this whole thing-

51:20.143 --> 51:23.237
It's just so crazy.

51:23.313 --> 51:25.406
Maybe we should get out of here.

51:25.482 --> 51:28.315
Just go back to New York.
What do you think?

51:30.153 --> 51:32.280
Really? Well, what about the shoot?

51:32.356 --> 51:34.290
Screw the job.
I can get another job.

51:34.358 --> 51:36.349
But I will not risk you.

51:41.064 --> 51:43.055
Yes.

51:53.710 --> 51:56.770
- Hello?
- Hey, man, am I waking you?

51:56.847 --> 51:59.372
No, no. I'm just watching TV.

51:59.449 --> 52:02.179
- What's goin' on?
- I've been thinking about Megumi.

52:02.252 --> 52:05.244
<i>You know what ever happened to her?</i>

52:06.490 --> 52:09.186
You know, it's funny.
I saw her the other day.

52:09.259 --> 52:11.318
What? Are you sure?

52:11.395 --> 52:13.386
<i>- Yeah.
- What did she say?</i>

52:13.463 --> 52:16.364
Nothing. She was just on the street.

52:16.433 --> 52:19.163
She was pointing at me,
and I just went the other way.

52:19.236 --> 52:21.170
She kind of creeps me out, man.

52:21.238 --> 52:25.470
<i>- But you were absolutely certain it was her.
- Yeah.</i>

52:25.542 --> 52:27.476
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

52:27.544 --> 52:29.978
<i>Uh, it's nobody, hon.
I'll be right there.</i>

52:30.047 --> 52:32.743
Bruno, I'm sorry, man.
Can I call you in the morning?

52:32.816 --> 52:35.148
Okay.

52:46.430 --> 52:48.364
If I'd have known
this was necessary...

52:48.432 --> 52:50.457
I would've worn something
a little nicer.

52:52.602 --> 52:55.400
That's gonna be just fine.

53:05.549 --> 53:07.779
I'm a little bit nervous.

53:07.851 --> 53:10.786
Oh, just pretend I'm a customer
at your restaurant.

53:10.854 --> 53:14.255
<i>Ha. I don't usually wait tables
in my underwear.</i>

53:15.826 --> 53:18.192
There's always a first time
for everything.

53:23.166 --> 53:25.157
You've gotta be kidding me.

53:25.235 --> 53:29.137
You wanna be a fashion model.
Your test photos need a little bit of fashion.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.922
Nice.

53:49.626 --> 53:52.424
- Giddyap, cowboy.
- I will.

53:57.501 --> 54:01.437
Look, I'm not gonna keep posing
if you're not gonna take the picture.

54:01.505 --> 54:03.905
Um, I'm gonna keep
taking the pictures.

54:03.974 --> 54:06.442
Um, let's move to the stairs, yeah?
Come on.

54:06.510 --> 54:09.104
All right.

54:14.050 --> 54:16.985
You are seriously beautiful.

54:42.479 --> 54:45.539
It's Bruno.

54:45.615 --> 54:49.244
- Hey, man. Uh-
- There's been an accident.

54:49.319 --> 54:52.550
- It's, uh, Adam.
- Oh, God. What kind of accident?

54:52.622 --> 54:55.750
They don't know. Um-
They don't know.

54:55.826 --> 54:57.817
Where are they keeping him?
We'll come right now.

54:57.894 --> 55:02.194
- He's in a hospital in Shinjuku.
- Okay. See you there.

55:34.130 --> 55:38.191
- Bruno should've been here.
- Try him again.

55:55.285 --> 55:58.015
Hello?

55:58.088 --> 56:03.082
Bruno. Look, man,
we really need you down here.

56:03.159 --> 56:05.150
Adam didn't make it.

56:27.083 --> 56:29.244
Bruno?

56:32.589 --> 56:34.523
Bruno.

56:48.705 --> 56:51.230
Bruno?

56:51.308 --> 56:53.242
<i>Bruno.</i>

57:30.213 --> 57:32.147
Bruno?

57:48.098 --> 57:50.362
<i>Bruno?</i>

57:50.433 --> 57:52.333
Bruno. Stop.

57:52.402 --> 57:56.133
<i>- Bruno! Bruno!
- No! No!</i>

57:56.206 --> 58:00.734
Bruno! Bruno!

58:22.298 --> 58:24.562
He was cutting up photos.

58:25.969 --> 58:27.960
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

58:31.241 --> 58:33.175
<i>I know.</i>

58:34.778 --> 58:36.769
She killed them.

58:36.846 --> 58:39.371
<i>She killed my friends.</i>

58:39.449 --> 58:41.747
<i>- Why them? We're the ones who hit her.
- I don't know.</i>

58:41.818 --> 58:45.083
And we can't stay here.

58:54.831 --> 58:56.765
It must be from Megan.

59:05.308 --> 59:08.209
Okay. I got the tickets.
We can change them at the counter.

59:08.278 --> 59:10.212
<i>We're not going anywhere.</i>

59:25.161 --> 59:27.959
These pictures were taken
before the crash.

59:28.031 --> 59:31.626
- How can she possibly-
- This isn't about the crash.

59:31.701 --> 59:33.726
She was with us before we got here.

59:33.803 --> 59:36.704
<i>She's been with us all along.</i>

59:40.310 --> 59:42.904
The medium said that spirits
are tied to the flesh.

59:44.147 --> 59:46.081
Even in death.

59:48.251 --> 59:50.242
Ben, we have to find her.

59:56.826 --> 01:00:00.660
<i>Megumi had a house a few hours
outside of Tokyo. We can start there.</i>

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.391
<i>Hello?</i>

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.462
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:38.452
Come on. She's not here.
Let's go.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.462
<i>Wait.</i>

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.589
Did you hear that?

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:53.772
<i>Ben.</i>

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:05.248
Come on.

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:37.142
Megumi?

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.434
Megumi?

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.677
<i>Megumi.</i>

01:03:20.697 --> 01:03:23.097
<i>Police said Megumi's funeral will be tomorrow.</i>

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.100
<i>She'll be cremated.</i>

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:27.159
<i>And then we can go home.</i>

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.823
Jane! Jane.

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:30.882
What's the matter?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.360
Ben?

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:38.500
Ben, what is it, baby?

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:43.963
- I had a dream. I had a dream.
- Oh.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.440
- Was it a bad dream?
- Just a dream.

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.644
Ben?

01:08:13.723 --> 01:08:17.055
Ben? Ben!

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.627
Ben!

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.429
Ben, it's- Ben!

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.761
Ben! Ben! Stop! No!

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:31.466
Please! Ben! Ben!

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.508
Oh, my God! Oh!

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:36.067
Ben?

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:38.136
Ben?

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:45.314
Get out! Leave us alone!

01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:48.551
Do you hear me?

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.161
Aaah! Help me!

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:07.240
Oh, God! He left you
because he never loved you!

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:16.180
Ben!

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:34.194
Oh!

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.868
Oh! I got you.

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.954
- Have a safe flight.
- Thank you.

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.138
- Bye.
- Take care.

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:07.713
Hey. I'm back.

01:17:08.891 --> 01:17:12.520
<i>Janie? I got the cheesecake.</i>

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:17.689
What's goin' on?

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:30.067
Where did you get those?

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:37.042
Stop.

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:46.183
- I said stop, Jane.
- What happened?

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:49.492
What did you do to that girl?

01:17:50.933 --> 01:17:54.266
- Honey, it's not what you-
- What did you do to her?

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:02.070
Baby, you don't know
what it was like.

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:04.009
She was crazy.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:07.446
<i>Janie, I didn't know what to do.
She wouldn't stop.</i>

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:10.451
<i>Adam said he had some pills.</i>

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:13.613
<i>Uh, like sleeping pills.
Just a little bit stronger.</i>

01:18:16.592 --> 01:18:19.584
One drink.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:27.060
<i>- Kanpai.
- Kanpai.</i>

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:39.076
All we were gonna do
is take pictures.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:41.877
Then, if she wouldn't stop,
I could use them against her.

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:45.147
<i>I could show them to people at work,
show them to her mother.</i>

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.359
It sounded okay
when we talked about it.

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:54.054
<i>- Ben.
- Come on.</i>

01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:58.793
- Just let me get a light.
- Come on. What are you waiting for?

01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:01.335
<i>- Ben?
- Come on, man! Take the picture.</i>

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:04.497
<i>- Don't leave us hangin' here.
- Ben?</i>

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.302
<i>- Ben?
- Hey, hey, hey. Easy.</i>

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:09.276
<i>- It's all right.
- It's fun. Don't worry about it.</i>

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:13.075
Hey, it's okay.
Yeah, don't worry about it. It's fine.

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:16.413
<i>You kiss a cheek too.</i>

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:18.783
- Ben.
- That look good?

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:22.346
<i>No, no, no, no. We're good.
We're good right here.</i>

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:25.985
<i>Great pills.</i>

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.858
<i>Did you get this?</i>

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.693
Come on.
Where you goin'?

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:33.326
- Ben. Ben!
- Where you goin', man? Come on.

01:19:33.402 --> 01:19:36.428
Let's do it on the floor.

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.632
- Yeah, you got her?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.807
She's strong.

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:50.340
<i>- Aah! That's a girl.
- Adam, hold her down.</i>

01:19:50.419 --> 01:19:52.353
<i>Ben!</i>

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:54.321
<i>Don't struggle!</i>

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:02.526
Janie, I know it was wrong.

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:05.896
I know I should've done something.
But I didn't touch that girl.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:09.495
<i>- What?
- I didn't touch her. I just took the pictures.</i>

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:12.249
- It was Adam and Bruno who
took that thing way too far.

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:13.564
- That's why she killed them!

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:16.802
But not me.

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:20.204
It was a warning.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:25.318
<i>She wanted me to see
the man that she knew.</i>

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:27.719
She was trying to help me.

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:30.553
- Jane, I'm a different person.
- How?

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:35.494
How does forgetting something like that
make you a different man?

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:40.433
- Jane.
- And the sick thing is, you could.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.828
You could live with this.

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:45.839
Janie. Jane!

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:48.535
<i>You don't understand.
The woman was crazy.</i>

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:50.373
Let's just take a deep breath here.

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:53.346
Let's just take a moment. Wait.

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:56.907
- I said wait, goddamn it!
- Wait for what?

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:59.886
What can you say
that will change anything?

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.518
I gotta go. I need-

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.583
I need time to think.

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:09.222
<i>No, I don't.</i>

01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:15.234
I won't spend my life with you.

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:17.237
Jane. Jane, don't leave me.

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:20.535
Don't leave me!

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:23.373
<i>Jane! Don't leave me with her!</i>

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:28.810
This is what you wanted, right?

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.881
You and me.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.723
Together forever.

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.998
Where are you?

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:50.161
Where are you?

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:53.766
She's gone.

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:56.606
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
Isn't it?

01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:17.789
<i>Honey, you gotta get that looked at.</i>

01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:20.494
<i>I think I tweaked
something back there.</i>

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:23.595
<i>- Look at you. You look like an old man.
- I know, I know.</i>

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:31.211
<i>She's been with us all along.</i>

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:45.552
Get off! Get off of me!

01:23:47.289 --> 01:23:49.757
You'll never win.
