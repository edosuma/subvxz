TO ENCOURAGE MYSELF
TO TRAVEL THE GALAXY

10:00.160 --> 10:01.860
BEFORE RETURNING
AS YOUR KING.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.580
BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING
I'VE LEARNED IN MY TRAVELS,

10:04.680 --> 10:06.620
IT'S THAT YOU CAN'T ROCK
WITH RULES.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.700
I MAY BE YOUR KING,
BUT I AM NOT YOUR RULER.

10:09.800 --> 10:14.060
FROM THIS DAY FORTH, THERE SHALL
BE NO RULER OF SYNTHOS.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.820
LET MUSIC GUIDE YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR DAYS.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.920
âTRULY LEGENDARY.
âHE'LL ALWAYS BE
KING OF MY HEART.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.260
âLEGENDARY!
âWOW!

10:20.360 --> 10:22.100
SORRY WE CHANGED YOUR PATCH,
GARY.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.820
YEAH.
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN PROBABLY.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.340
REAL ROCK STARS
HAVE NO NEED FOR APOLOGIES.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.260
NOW,
LET'S BLOW THIS SCENE.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.700
WINGS ARE ON ME.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.380
OH, FINALLY!

10:31.480 --> 10:33.480
NOW CAN WE PLEASE
GO TO THE MALL?
