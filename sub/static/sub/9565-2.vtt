WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:03.039
My head's forgotten bits of me.<BR/>

00:03.201 --> 00:06.460
Every day, I was there.
You should have fucking helped me.

00:06.580 --> 00:07.719
All right!

00:07.880 --> 00:10.239
- <i>My new friends, Rory and Lachlan.</i>
- <i>All right, wee man!</i>

00:10.401 --> 00:12.612
<i>Rory's going to let me
blow his chanter later.</i>

00:12.732 --> 00:14.460
<i>You just need to learn
tae finger it.</i>

00:16.641 --> 00:21.020
Tony, hi! They said you were like
a total mong and I would have been

00:21.140 --> 00:23.860
so pissed if you were a vegetable
and had to be switched off, yah?

00:24.160 --> 00:25.900
Sorry. Can't place you.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.239
Come on, Tone.

00:28.401 --> 00:31.460
When it happened, before the bus,
he was on the phone and he said

00:31.580 --> 00:33.780
something I don't think he remembers.

00:34.540 --> 00:35.580
Jesus!

00:35.880 --> 00:37.700
I will remember everything.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.340
Tone...

00:43.180 --> 00:44.620
Who's there?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

02:28.760 --> 02:33.660
<i>Lucy? Can you hear me?</i>

02:38.920 --> 02:40.300
<i>Lucy!</i>

03:03.500 --> 03:05.820
You wearing perfume, love?

03:06.120 --> 03:07.740
It's the new air freshener thing.

03:07.860 --> 03:09.799
I bought it for the bathroom.

03:09.961 --> 03:11.367
Thought Maxxie got you perfume?

03:11.487 --> 03:13.918
Thought, here's posh,
boyfriend who buys you perfume.

03:14.038 --> 03:15.580
He'd buy me perfume if I asked.

03:15.700 --> 03:16.700
Oh, I know.

03:16.820 --> 03:18.418
Do anything, wouldn't he?

03:18.538 --> 03:21.780
Long as you don't introduce him to
the scary disabled mother, that is.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.870
I will introduce him to you.

03:23.990 --> 03:26.220
When the cock crows thrice, I know.

03:27.780 --> 03:28.740
Done?

03:32.721 --> 03:36.660
Always leave the waters a tip,
that's what your gran used to say.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.180
'Did you hear that?

03:45.300 --> 03:48.420
<i>The building's coming down,
there's nothing we can do.</i>

03:48.720 --> 03:50.220
If I'm to die,

03:50.340 --> 03:53.559
I'd rather it be with you
than anyone else in the world.

03:53.721 --> 03:58.300
Darling, oh, darling, how long
I've waited to hear those words.

04:01.542 --> 04:05.520
# Once I was a lonely banker

04:07.177 --> 04:12.083
# All I cared for
were margins and accounts

04:13.749 --> 04:18.363
# I'd pass you
on the phone each morning

04:19.918 --> 04:24.770
# I knew one day that
love would sprout

04:27.000 --> 04:31.420
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

04:31.540 --> 04:35.140
# Osama blew them away

04:35.260 --> 04:39.860
# And now I know how I feel. #

04:48.481 --> 04:52.940
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

04:53.060 --> 04:57.540
# Osama blew them away

04:57.660 --> 05:01.940
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

05:02.240 --> 05:06.580
# Osama blew them away

05:06.880 --> 05:08.260
# Then came the day... #

05:08.380 --> 05:10.980
No, no, no, no, NO!

05:12.800 --> 05:13.800
No.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.740
Do you know what this is?

05:22.860 --> 05:24.700
This is my script

05:25.000 --> 05:26.220
and I'm burning it.

05:26.340 --> 05:28.460
And do you know why? Becau...

05:28.580 --> 05:31.260
Oh, does someone wanna
give me a hand here, please?

05:31.380 --> 05:34.740
Quickly, quickly, thank you.
Because... You know I've burnt my...

05:34.860 --> 05:37.660
Thing... Because you made it shit!

05:37.780 --> 05:39.220
SHIT!

05:43.660 --> 05:45.460
Do you know what we're doing here?

05:45.580 --> 05:47.100
Do you?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.140
Max...

05:50.260 --> 05:51.700
This is an opportunity,

05:51.820 --> 05:55.020
a real opportunity,
to tell the tragedy of my people.

05:55.140 --> 05:56.140
You're American?

05:56.260 --> 05:59.700
Yes, I am.
Metaphorically.

05:59.820 --> 06:04.660
Look, in two hours time
this woman will be dead. Dead!

06:05.720 --> 06:06.800
And you know why?

06:06.960 --> 06:09.980
Because Osama in pyjamas is making
his way up the stairs

06:10.100 --> 06:11.540
to take us unawares.

06:11.660 --> 06:13.919
Oh, get off me, Bruce.

06:14.081 --> 06:17.700
Outside the world is crumbling,

06:17.820 --> 06:21.260
the towers are coming down.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.980
But soon... she'll forget.

06:26.660 --> 06:30.220
When two lips...
Oh, sod it, time for show and tell.

06:39.281 --> 06:41.319
To paraphrase, Mr Punch, son,

06:41.481 --> 06:42.860
"That's the way to do it".

06:42.980 --> 06:44.620
Now, from Michelle's verse!

06:44.740 --> 06:46.300
Come on! Wooh!

06:52.820 --> 06:57.500
# I'd bring you coffee and a bagel

06:58.600 --> 07:02.900
# But you never had the time for me

07:05.220 --> 07:09.980
# I dreamed that
one day you'd say, "Hey, girl"

07:11.560 --> 07:15.860
# "That bagel's mighty
fine, it's plain to see"

07:17.681 --> 07:21.980
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

07:22.100 --> 07:26.140
# Osama blew them away

07:26.260 --> 07:31.260
# And now you know how I feel

07:34.281 --> 07:38.620
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

07:38.920 --> 07:43.500
# Osama blew them away... #

07:49.820 --> 07:51.300
What the fuck?!

07:54.700 --> 07:58.140
It just slipped. Sorry.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.580
Not funny, OK? This is like
the 15th present this week.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.540
It's getting quite spooky, innit?
How's he getting in your locker?

08:18.840 --> 08:20.460
I wish he'd just tell me who he is.

08:20.580 --> 08:21.700
What is it?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.660
An Oscar?

08:23.780 --> 08:24.980
Full of chocolate.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.020
Every actor's dream though, innit?

08:29.320 --> 08:31.660
What are you talking about, mate?

08:31.780 --> 08:33.620
Stalker - the ultimate accessory.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.860
Not everyone's as desperate
for sex as you, Anwar.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.020
Sid!

08:37.140 --> 08:40.740
No, he's right. See theses hands,
fucking friction burns, man!

08:40.860 --> 08:44.420
My sisters are getting suspicious
about their disappearing hand cream.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.260
I'm gonna get you laid tonight.

08:46.380 --> 08:50.180
I'll bring some spare hand cream,
you just bring your smile!

09:26.500 --> 09:28.319
<i>Fucking leave me alone, will you.</i>

09:28.481 --> 09:31.660
No seriously, Sid, what have you
come as? A cardboard Big Dickus?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.359
Gladiator to the stars.

09:34.521 --> 09:36.180
Fuck off!

09:36.300 --> 09:40.140
So, stalky-stalky-stalk-stalk.
Do you think he's coming tonight?

09:40.260 --> 09:42.300
Shit! It could be any
one of these people.

09:42.420 --> 09:43.340
Don't!

09:43.460 --> 09:46.700
If he was clever he'd come as a
sort of film where the stalker wins.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.839
You know,
Hugh Grant in Four Weddings.

09:49.001 --> 09:51.119
What?
How is Four Weddings about stalking?

09:51.281 --> 09:52.980
Four weddings? One funeral?

09:53.100 --> 09:55.020
And Hugh just happens
to be at all five.

09:55.140 --> 09:57.754
You'd think Andie MacDowell
was cleverer than that.

09:57.874 --> 10:00.456
Oh. My. God.

10:02.580 --> 10:05.039
Go on, guess. Guess.

10:05.201 --> 10:07.020
Eh, give up?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.100
Daisy Werthan.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.940
I don't know who she is either.

10:13.060 --> 10:16.100
Driving Miss Daisy!
Best Picture Oscar, 1990.

10:16.220 --> 10:18.860
And this is my man, who is...

10:18.980 --> 10:19.999
Morgan Freeman.

10:20.161 --> 10:23.020
No! How many times
have I got to tell you?

10:23.440 --> 10:27.079
OK, you're Hoke. Yeah?
Actor, Freeman, part, Hoke.

10:27.241 --> 10:29.839
You don't know the first thing
about films do you, Kenneth?

10:30.001 --> 10:31.574
How many films
have you seen, Chris?

10:31.694 --> 10:33.039
- Counting porn?
- Well, no.

10:33.201 --> 10:34.020
One.

10:34.140 --> 10:36.260
Driving Miss Daisy. It's a classic.

10:36.380 --> 10:39.220
Interestingly, they did make
a porn version of the film -

10:39.340 --> 10:42.060
it was called Fisting Miss Daisy.
It's a really good film.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.780
Really stood up to the original.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.220
Phenomenal.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.180
Here comes my leading lady.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.820
Hoo, what an entrance!

11:14.201 --> 11:16.060
What? Oh!

11:16.180 --> 11:18.639
Princess Leia, right? Jinx!

11:18.801 --> 11:20.999
And you look, so

11:21.161 --> 11:22.599
home made.

11:22.761 --> 11:25.940
Doesn't she, Tony?
Gloriously quaint.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.340
Hi, Michelle.

11:27.460 --> 11:30.959
You dressed as Luke? For her?

11:31.121 --> 11:34.740
Well, I guess I...

11:36.421 --> 11:37.540
Did I?

11:38.580 --> 11:39.580
Tony!

11:41.441 --> 11:44.580
You think either of them's
actually seen Star Wars?

11:44.700 --> 11:46.540
You reckon they know
Luke's her brother?

11:55.460 --> 11:59.900
I stood here solid and
no-one could rock me.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.740
But now comes a mullah
who'll awe and shock me...

12:03.860 --> 12:06.159
Yep, that works. That really works.
That's lovely.

12:06.380 --> 12:07.820
Mr Gelpart.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.180
Well, I never, the light dropper.

12:12.300 --> 12:16.380
Thank you, sincerely.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.439
You made the rehearsal feel...
dangerous.

12:19.601 --> 12:20.940
I want to act.

12:21.060 --> 12:22.260
Yeah, well who doesn't?

12:22.380 --> 12:24.430
I need Michelle's part.

12:24.550 --> 12:26.420
- What?
- She's terrible.

12:27.721 --> 12:29.799
I should play her.

12:29.961 --> 12:31.759
Oh, my dear...

12:34.361 --> 12:37.900
Acting is about truth.

12:38.020 --> 12:41.500
Truth is about beauty.

12:41.620 --> 12:44.260
Ugly people lack believability.

12:44.380 --> 12:46.780
Now, how can I put this kindly?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.140
You look like a liar.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.999
I really want that part.

12:54.761 --> 12:56.411
Not on my ship, darling.

13:00.860 --> 13:03.260
In there, mate.
Let's see what we can grab.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.060
Come on, Bruce. Where the goodies at?

13:07.180 --> 13:08.820
Whoa! Shit!

13:08.940 --> 13:11.014
If Bruce can get laid, anyone can.

13:11.134 --> 13:12.500
What's the plan then, Rambo?

13:12.620 --> 13:15.340
It's an ancient dating
strategy for getting laid.

13:15.460 --> 13:18.260
Mark yourself out of ten,
and then aim two points below.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.140
An eight, goes for a six.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.860
That way, guaranteed success.

13:24.620 --> 13:25.900
Look,

13:26.020 --> 13:28.563
a poodle doesn't get nothing
with a labrador,

13:28.683 --> 13:31.919
but if he aims for a chihuahua? Woof!

13:32.081 --> 13:34.279
So what number are
you then, hound-dog?

13:34.440 --> 13:35.439
A seven.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.119
A six?

13:42.281 --> 13:44.519
I'm not a five.

13:44.681 --> 13:47.599
Am I a five?

13:47.761 --> 13:49.919
Mate. You're a seven.
Course you are.

13:50.081 --> 13:52.580
Yeah, baby! So we need
to find me a five, yeah?

14:50.161 --> 14:52.580
Mate, I've found your five.
Wait here.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.260
What? Where?

14:54.681 --> 14:56.460
Hi, hello.

14:56.580 --> 14:57.599
Hi, I, er...

14:57.761 --> 15:02.519
You were the one who
dropped the light, right?

15:02.681 --> 15:04.780
Maxxie. You're a fucking genius.

15:06.180 --> 15:07.540
You're single, right?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.540
What?

15:10.780 --> 15:12.359
You got a boyfriend?

15:12.521 --> 15:14.020
A guy?

15:14.140 --> 15:15.980
No. I've got no-one.

15:16.100 --> 15:19.100
I mean, yeah. I'm single.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.500
Cool. So what do you say,

15:22.620 --> 15:24.300
dance with my mate, Anwar?

15:24.420 --> 15:26.020
He's seventh heaven.

15:27.860 --> 15:28.980
Anwar?

15:29.100 --> 15:31.580
Yeah. Anwar, baby. 007.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.660
And you, my Chanel No 5.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.580
Sorry. I've got to go.

15:41.780 --> 15:43.180
What? Hang on.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.380
You sure I'm a seven?

15:54.940 --> 15:57.620
Let's look for some fours, shall we?

15:57.740 --> 15:59.780
Just in case.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.199
I can't believe after everything
that's happened,

16:32.361 --> 16:34.079
you'd bring her to the party.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.220
She, er, says I'm her boyfriend.

16:47.100 --> 16:50.799
You're not Tony any more, are you?

16:50.961 --> 16:52.159
Yeah, I'm Tony.

16:52.695 --> 16:53.695
OK.

16:54.540 --> 16:57.540
On the day of the accident,
you were on the phone to me.

16:57.660 --> 16:58.839
Tell me what you said.

17:02.020 --> 17:05.238
Doctors told me some things
would take a while to come back.

17:08.140 --> 17:09.579
OK, then.

17:12.180 --> 17:13.679
Let's bring you back.

17:26.339 --> 17:29.759
Come on, come on.
I want to touch you.

17:33.660 --> 17:34.660
I can't...

17:34.780 --> 17:36.439
Course you can.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.980
Oh. You're not...

17:54.060 --> 17:55.980
No. I'm not.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.420
I've got to go.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.380
Not worth it, are they?

18:13.500 --> 18:14.639
Who the fuck are you?

18:23.620 --> 18:26.660
How come boys could do that to us?

18:26.780 --> 18:28.199
Make us feel like shit?

18:30.140 --> 18:31.580
He didn't...

18:34.580 --> 18:36.319
You don't understand.

18:36.481 --> 18:37.420
OK.

18:37.540 --> 18:39.719
It's difficult for him now.

18:42.820 --> 18:43.820
Us now.

18:48.380 --> 18:51.580
But do you remember what it was like
to kiss him for the first time?

18:53.780 --> 18:57.200
That magic moment when
everything changed?

19:08.220 --> 19:09.719
Fancy a beer?

20:43.441 --> 20:44.860
Is that you, Maxxie?

20:50.980 --> 20:53.399
It's the dog, I'm telling you.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.919
Hey, Dad. Night.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.119
<i>Underpants.</i>

23:36.200 --> 23:37.400
<i>To the mirror.</i>

23:40.560 --> 23:41.560
<i>Cupboard.</i>

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
<i>Trousers.</i>

23:48.880 --> 23:50.813
<i>Back to the mirror.</i>

23:51.961 --> 23:53.400
Aftershave.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.720
Mirror again.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.800
Lucy? That you, love?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.240
Lucy?

24:31.320 --> 24:32.800
Yes, Mum.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.760
I need a hand in here.

24:38.360 --> 24:39.800
Jesus, Mum! What happened?

24:39.920 --> 24:43.080
When you weren't back when you said,
I thought you'd gone to bed.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.880
But I wanted to check and...

24:45.000 --> 24:46.680
Am I wet?

24:46.800 --> 24:48.560
I'm wet, aren't I?

24:56.600 --> 24:58.720
- Did you spend the night with him?
- Don't.

25:01.681 --> 25:03.120
Let's get these wet clothes off.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.160
No wait.
Better give me a pain pill first.

25:07.688 --> 25:08.880
Better make it two.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.320
No. The doctor said.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.280
They're emetics.
I don't want you vomiting.

25:17.721 --> 25:19.519
You're a good girl.

25:19.681 --> 25:22.000
Maxxie's lucky to have you.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.200
Mum?

25:29.640 --> 25:31.519
I've got something to tell you.

25:33.561 --> 25:35.520
It was my fault.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.160
I was stupid.

25:38.280 --> 25:42.440
I wanted to be alone so I went and
sat in one of the bedrooms upstairs.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.040
And Bruce...

25:44.160 --> 25:47.000
Mr Gelpart, the drama teacher...

25:47.120 --> 25:50.520
He came in and asked
whether I wanted comforting.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.680
And I didn't say no.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.600
It was his party and his house so...

25:56.680 --> 25:59.120
And it was just his hands.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.800
Mr Gelpart's hands.

26:01.920 --> 26:06.360
I mean, he... didn't make me touch
him or put his anything near me.

26:06.480 --> 26:09.040
Just kissed me on the cheek...

26:09.160 --> 26:10.880
and kept kissing me

26:11.000 --> 26:13.560
and rubbing his hands over me.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.880
And he said I was great...

26:16.000 --> 26:18.640
because I had little tits.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.280
"Almost like a boy," he said.

26:22.241 --> 26:23.999
And that was it.

26:24.161 --> 26:26.080
He didn't even touch
any other part of me.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.800
Just my cheek...

26:28.920 --> 26:30.160
and my tits.

26:34.800 --> 26:38.960
Right. Cheek and tits. Right.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.680
Right.

26:41.960 --> 26:42.920
Tits.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.200
Right.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.200
Oh, dear!

27:20.080 --> 27:22.720
I heard he got his cock out and
there's a tattoo of Harry Potter,

27:22.840 --> 27:26.560
and he started shouting at Sketch
"Kiss Harry to make him magic".

27:26.680 --> 27:29.280
Drama teachers, man.
"Pretend to be a tree".

27:29.400 --> 27:31.280
"But I'm not a tree".
"Well, pretend".

27:31.400 --> 27:33.720
Fucking perverts, the lot of 'em!

27:39.560 --> 27:41.120
Is it true?

27:42.760 --> 27:44.120
Yeah. It's true.

27:45.960 --> 27:49.080
That creep! That fucking animal!

27:49.200 --> 27:52.080
I'm so sorry, Sketch.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.440
I'm the one who should be sorry.
I wasn't going to say anything,

27:55.560 --> 28:00.479
but my mum insisted. Have I
ruined everything? The play and...

28:00.641 --> 28:03.840
Fuck the play! Come and sit with us.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.199
That's grown-up, Tony.

28:11.361 --> 28:13.200
I've finished. That's all.

28:23.601 --> 28:25.200
What you doing, you tramp?

28:29.600 --> 28:31.359
In my culture, we share our food.

28:31.521 --> 28:33.319
Michelle's got a new friend then.

28:33.481 --> 28:34.481
Yeah.

28:35.321 --> 28:38.640
It's a Saveloy, man. It draws me in.
It's the devil's plaything.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.680
It's an aphrodisiac, too, I've heard.

28:42.761 --> 28:47.320
Come on, Sketch. We can do better
than these two. Let's go.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.400
Sketch?

29:22.440 --> 29:23.440
Sketch?

29:24.680 --> 29:25.920
<i>Who is this?</i>

29:26.040 --> 29:28.800
Who's this? Who are you?

29:29.280 --> 29:31.600
We've had enough of you kids
playing. Leave us alone!

29:31.720 --> 29:34.440
What? Look! Do you have
a daughter at the school?

29:34.560 --> 29:37.479
None of your business.
Leave us alone!

29:37.641 --> 29:42.079
I need to know! This is important.
Look, my name's Maxxie.

29:42.241 --> 29:44.159
Your name's Maxxie?

29:44.321 --> 29:45.440
Yeah.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.040
Maxxie in the school play?

29:49.120 --> 29:51.120
Maxxie who's dating my daughter?

29:54.240 --> 29:55.240
What?!

29:55.901 --> 29:57.919
What are you doing
answering the door?

29:58.081 --> 29:59.839
- The disgrace!
- Disgrace?

30:00.001 --> 30:02.239
Lies, all lies! A boyfriend?

30:02.401 --> 30:03.799
No, you haven't.

30:03.961 --> 30:07.080
After all I've done for you,
you fucking... You fucking!

30:09.040 --> 30:11.119
Oh my God! The drama teacher?

30:11.281 --> 30:13.400
You lied about him too, haven't you!

30:14.760 --> 30:17.040
Well, I'm not gonna
let you ruin a man's life.

30:19.840 --> 30:23.359
Ow! No! I didn't
bring you up to be a liar!

30:23.521 --> 30:26.600
You didn't bring me up at all!
You fucking... cripple!

30:34.120 --> 30:35.280
So... what?

30:36.880 --> 30:40.440
You going to keep holding me to the
bed all day and all night, are you?

30:42.440 --> 30:44.999
Whatever trouble you're in,
I'll support you.

30:45.161 --> 30:46.800
But this is a man's life.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.440
It's for your own good.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.960
Crawling out of bed
isn't good for you.

30:58.080 --> 31:01.960
I will not...
let you fuck up my life, Mum.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.080
OK?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Lucy?

31:26.160 --> 31:27.160
Lucy!

31:31.881 --> 31:36.080
# Just time to say the things I must

31:38.041 --> 31:41.680
# Before my hopes all turn to dust

31:43.400 --> 31:45.719
# Now nothing seems to matter

31:45.881 --> 31:49.239
# And every word is true

31:49.401 --> 31:51.919
# When I say I'm blown away

31:52.081 --> 31:54.200
# With you

31:56.281 --> 31:58.800
# Then came the day

31:58.920 --> 32:01.040
# You blew me away

32:01.160 --> 32:04.040
# Osama blew them away

32:05.440 --> 32:08.040
# What can I say?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.440
# You blew me away

32:10.560 --> 32:12.600
# And now I'm falling...

32:12.720 --> 32:14.000
# Now I'm falling

32:14.120 --> 32:16.000
# We're falling...

32:17.400 --> 32:19.000
# In love. #

32:27.641 --> 32:30.440
Ah, the magic of the stage.
The thrill of anticipation.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.400
I feel like a Roman about to
throw a lion at the Christians.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.040
Chris, it's a school musical.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.719
But who do you think would win
between Maxxie and a lion?

32:37.881 --> 32:41.160
<i>Osama the Musical,
this is your half-hour call.</i>

32:43.000 --> 32:44.920
Do you want to help me get dressed?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.360
You want me to look good,
don't you?

32:50.640 --> 32:51.640
You nervous?

32:51.760 --> 32:55.040
Oh, God. On a scale of one to...
Oh, fuck scales, I'm shitting it!

32:56.080 --> 32:57.320
You're gonna be so good.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.560
I'm under-rehearsed and shit!

33:00.289 --> 33:02.280
Do you want something
to get you through it?

33:03.235 --> 33:04.519
What have you got?

33:04.681 --> 33:06.560
Pills of my mum's.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.520
You need to take three
to get a decent hit.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.000
Anti-anxieties.
They'll chill you out.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.040
Go on, I'd love to help you out.

33:24.360 --> 33:25.920
OK, thanks.

33:45.761 --> 33:47.440
My mother was right!

33:47.560 --> 33:51.479
"Do science", she said,
"Do science. Science makes sense."

33:51.641 --> 33:54.680
But the lights drew me...
like a moth to a flame.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.839
Right! Nothing for it.
Cancellation o'clock.

34:00.001 --> 34:01.760
I know the words!

34:03.279 --> 34:04.079
What?!

34:04.241 --> 34:05.680
You do?

34:07.000 --> 34:08.518
Oh, my God!

34:08.681 --> 34:11.918
I've been helping her learn them.
I know them all.

34:12.081 --> 34:14.080
I think you just
saved my Welsh rarebit.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.679
Let's get you into costume.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.800
We're over ten minutes late now.
It's time for action.

34:31.760 --> 34:36.719
If Rome won't go to Mohammed, then
Mohammed will clap until it does.

34:41.029 --> 34:42.029
Hi, Tony.

34:42.509 --> 34:44.280
That's someone's seat.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.840
Yes, honey, it's for your queen bee.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.960
Zzzzzz!

34:53.639 --> 34:55.400
Works every time.

34:58.240 --> 35:03.178
# We-e-e-e-e-e're...

35:03.640 --> 35:07.479
# The last of the super powers

35:07.680 --> 35:11.160
# George Dubya is our leader

35:11.280 --> 35:14.960
# We've still got both Twin Towers

35:15.080 --> 35:17.160
# Never heard of Al-Qaeda

35:18.520 --> 35:21.839
# It's September the 11th

35:22.001 --> 35:24.559
# Just another day

35:24.721 --> 35:28.600
# In a tower in downtown heaven

35:28.720 --> 35:30.600
# New York City

35:32.200 --> 35:33.720
# US of A

35:41.721 --> 35:44.359
# Today will be better

35:44.521 --> 35:47.039
# Today will be the one

35:47.201 --> 35:49.399
# Today is no red letter

35:49.561 --> 35:51.839
# It's out there to be won

35:52.001 --> 35:54.359
# Today my sun is shining

35:54.521 --> 35:56.439
# Today is somewhere new

35:56.601 --> 35:59.119
# Today's a silver lining

35:59.281 --> 36:02.040
# Today will see me through

36:02.160 --> 36:04.080
# Today will be better

36:04.200 --> 36:06.680
# Today will be the one

36:06.800 --> 36:09.239
# Today is no red letter

36:09.401 --> 36:11.840
# It's out there to be won

36:11.960 --> 36:13.719
# Today you'll know I love you

36:13.881 --> 36:16.519
# Today you'll see it's true

36:16.681 --> 36:19.680
# Today's a day for saying I love you

36:23.481 --> 36:25.399
What a swell day to live in America!

36:25.561 --> 36:26.960
Gee, it sure is, buddy!

36:32.041 --> 36:33.839
How much do you make today?

36:34.001 --> 36:35.999
One million bucks!

36:36.161 --> 36:38.160
Did you see
the Wall Street Journal?

36:38.280 --> 36:41.600
Stocks are rising!
Have a nice day! Have a nice day!

36:51.840 --> 36:54.080
# Today will be better

36:54.200 --> 36:57.000
# Today will be the one... #

37:01.200 --> 37:02.480
Michelle?

37:02.600 --> 37:04.002
I'm in here, Tony.

37:07.601 --> 37:08.880
Don't come in.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.640
I've got vomit in my hair.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.040
I just searched
half the school for you.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.760
I don't know why.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.920
Because you care about me.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.800
I told you I loved you, didn't I?
The day it happened.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.200
The accident.

37:38.360 --> 37:41.960
Do you actually remember
or is that a guess?

37:42.080 --> 37:45.280
Does it matter?
Doesn't change anything.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.160
No.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.520
Should I say something else now?

37:56.480 --> 37:57.480
No.

37:59.440 --> 38:01.240
Let's just say nothing for a bit.

38:25.640 --> 38:26.860
Michelle? Is Chelle OK?

38:26.980 --> 38:29.120
I just gave her some mild
stuff to make her vomit.

38:29.399 --> 38:31.799
The look of her waist,
I'm sure she's thrown up worse.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.540
Who the fuck are you?

38:33.840 --> 38:35.820
Do you believe in magic, Maxxie?

38:37.660 --> 38:38.700
When we kiss...

38:39.000 --> 38:40.060
When we kiss...

38:40.360 --> 38:41.420
I'm gay!

38:41.540 --> 38:43.260
Do you understand that?!

38:43.380 --> 38:46.020
Look at me! I'm as close
to a boy as you can get!

38:46.320 --> 38:48.060
You could love me.

38:49.180 --> 38:50.700
We could love each other.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.220
You're fucking crazy!

38:52.340 --> 38:54.260
Excuse me. Excuse me.

39:00.420 --> 39:02.660
# I'm Boogie-Woogie Bagel Boy
Let's get stuffed

39:02.780 --> 39:05.740
# He's the Boogie-Woogie Bagel Boy
Watch him move... #

39:05.860 --> 39:08.380
You see? Just like a boy.

39:09.460 --> 39:12.879
Can you feel how hard
my heart is beating?

39:13.041 --> 39:15.700
That's because by the end
of this play, you'll have kissed me.

39:15.820 --> 39:20.340
And when you kiss me, everything
will change. Maxxie, I love you.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.700
That's our cue.

39:51.039 --> 39:55.051
# Once I was a lonely banker

39:56.140 --> 40:00.940
# All I cared for
were margins and accounts

40:02.740 --> 40:04.300
# I dreamed

40:04.420 --> 40:08.700
# Of Dow Jones and the FTSE

40:09.000 --> 40:13.060
# I didn't see my credit running out

40:15.883 --> 40:20.387
# I passed you
on the phone each morning

40:22.000 --> 40:25.460
# I always gave a cheery smile

40:27.540 --> 40:29.220
# But you

40:29.340 --> 40:32.380
# You never even saw me

40:33.460 --> 40:37.380
# You were
far too busy all the while

40:39.940 --> 40:44.780
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

40:44.900 --> 40:48.500
# Osama blew them away

40:48.800 --> 40:53.620
# And now you know how I feel

40:55.740 --> 40:58.340
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

40:59.940 --> 41:01.420
# Osama blew them away

41:04.260 --> 41:07.260
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

41:09.420 --> 41:11.380
# Osama blew them away

41:13.441 --> 41:18.220
# Then came the day
Osama blew us away

41:19.420 --> 41:21.420
Nothing.

41:22.620 --> 41:25.100
I felt... nothing.

41:26.220 --> 41:27.820
You disgust me.

41:32.220 --> 41:33.220
No!

41:33.340 --> 41:36.540
That's not how it goes!
It's not! It's not!

41:36.660 --> 41:39.620
You think you can fuck my life
up and I'll start fancying you?

41:39.920 --> 41:42.100
Look at yourself.

41:42.220 --> 41:43.740
Stay out of my life.

42:21.140 --> 42:22.690
Now that's an ending!

43:30.540 --> 43:32.300
You look beautiful.

43:38.460 --> 43:41.100
You always look beautiful to me.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.340
Argh! Fuck!

44:01.260 --> 44:02.700
Oh. Hi.

Can I come in?

44:14.100 --> 44:15.660
Well, um...

44:16.700 --> 44:18.820
Maxxie says you're a psycho.

44:19.860 --> 44:21.500
He thinks I fancy him.

44:21.620 --> 44:24.460
I don't. I fancy you.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.180
I wanna have sex with you.

44:27.480 --> 44:29.820
But I can't do it
from out here, can I?

44:29.940 --> 44:32.780
Shit, man.

filmography of Hugh Grant since'92?

45:12.340 --> 45:13.980
The Englishman Who Came...

45:14.100 --> 45:16.100
Came Up A Hill...

45:16.220 --> 45:18.580
And Went Down A Mountain.

Just thought I'd pop round,

My mum's coming so she can pretend
to be married to my dad

46:09.259 --> 46:10.600
