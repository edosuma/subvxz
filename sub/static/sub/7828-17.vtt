00:33.700 --> 00:36.000
This place is gonna smell classy
all week.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.300
To Homer, the Wall Street genius!

00:47.900 --> 00:50.800
Hey, Homer, how come you got
money to burn? Or singe, anyway.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.900
- Yeah, what's your secret investment?
- Take a guess.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.100
Pumpkins?

00:56.200 --> 00:59.500
Yeah, that's right, Barney.
This year, I invested in pumpkins.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.100
They've been going up
the whole month of October.

01:02.300 --> 01:05.500
And I got a feeling they're gonna peak
right around January.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.500
And bang! That's when I'll cash in.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.500
To Homer!
And to Sergeant Pepper...

01:10.800 --> 01:13.700
...who's growing out of
the middle of your back!

01:14.500 --> 01:17.200
Barn, you gotta unwrap the
plastic before you smoke these.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.700
- Hey, Homer.
- Yeah!

01:18.900 --> 01:20.900
- Hey, Homer.
- Way to go.

01:25.100 --> 01:28.700
I told you a hundred times, you gotta sell
your pumpkin futures before Halloween.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.300
Let's not panic. I'll make the money back
by selling a liver.

01:32.100 --> 01:33.400
I can get by with one.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.500
Oh, how am I gonna tell Marge
we're broke?

01:36.900 --> 01:38.500
I need a miracle.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.500
My house is on fire!

01:40.700 --> 01:42.500
Insurance to the rescue!

01:46.800 --> 01:48.700
- Hello, Homer.
- Hello, Homer.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.500
Marge, we had a deal.

01:51.700 --> 01:55.400
Your sisters don't come here after 6,
and I stop eating your lipstick.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.300
This is a special occasion.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.600
Patty and Selma just got promoted
at the DMV.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, Homer. Let your wife
have a glimpse of success for once.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.100
All right, that's the last straw.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.699
Time to take out the trash!

02:10.000 --> 02:12.400
But first, I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.600
I'm sorry.
Homer doesn't mean to be rude.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.100
He's just a very complicated man.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.600
Wrong!

02:27.800 --> 02:30.400
When are you going to wake up
and smell your husband, Marge?

02:30.700 --> 02:32.200
You got some kids out of him.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.700
But when the seeds have been planted,
you throw away the envelope.

02:35.700 --> 02:39.200
I wish you wouldn't put Homer down.
He may not be a big success like you...

02:39.400 --> 02:42.500
...but I can always count on him
to provide for the family.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.800
Sweet, trusting Marge, I can't let you
down. I'll get some money somehow.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.600
Hello, Vegas?
Give me a hundred bucks on red.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.400
All right. I'll send you a check.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.600
If only I could think of an invention.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.300
Something that would
really make money.

03:02.700 --> 03:06.600
Must concentrate and work
harder than I've ever worked...

03:11.800 --> 03:13.200
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.900
This invention of yours has made us
all rich, especially you.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.200
It's simple, yet ingenious.
And it fits right in the palm of your hand.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.900
Every person in America now owns one
of these. In many cases, three or four.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.700
Can I just get a look at that?

03:25.800 --> 03:29.300
Why would you need to see it? You're
the genius who invented the product.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.200
- But could I just...?
- Don't worry.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.600
You'll get to see it just as soon
as we unveil our new ad campaign.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.600
- Let me see! Out of the way!
- Homer!

03:38.800 --> 03:42.800
Homer, wake up! There's still
a few minutes till our usual bedtime.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.000
No! My invention!

03:44.300 --> 03:46.300
- My money problems could've...
- Money problems?

03:46.500 --> 03:48.800
Homer, are we in some sort
of fiduciary trouble?

03:52.200 --> 03:54.400
Oh, Marge, my loyal wife...

03:54.700 --> 03:56.200
...of course not.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.100
And Lisa, my little princess.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.800
And who could forget dear Rat Boy?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.200
Rat Boy? I resent that.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.100
Bart, I told you before.
Stop gnawing on the drywall.

04:08.700 --> 04:13.000
What a day, eh, Milhouse?
The sun is out, birds are singing...

04:12.500 --> 04:15.200
...bees are trying to have sex
with them, as I understand it.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.000
It is a gorgeously fabulous day.
Marvelous, even.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.900
So, what's your hurry
to get to school?

04:23.200 --> 04:26.400
Nothing. What's your hurry?

04:28.300 --> 04:31.600
That's enough, Bart. Fun is fun,
but if we're late, we'll get in trouble.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.800
You're right, Milhouse.
Fun is fun.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.600
Attention, students. It's time to choose
a gym class for the coming term.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.500
So let's prove how adult we can be...

04:44.800 --> 04:47.000
...by filing to the gym
in a calm, orderly manner.

04:47.300 --> 04:51.100
Even though it's first come, first serve,
and the popular sports fill up fast.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.000
Too many wee ones!

04:58.100 --> 05:01.100
This gets uglier every year.
Any sign of Bart and Milhouse?

05:01.200 --> 05:04.600
No, and if they don't get here soon,
it'll be T.S. For them.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.300
I don't feel right.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.000
Do you hear that, Bart?
That was the tardy bell!

05:13.300 --> 05:16.700
"Truant! Truant! Truant!"
They'll all say!

05:17.100 --> 05:20.200
Who needs him?
I can have fun all by myself.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.700
It's all right? It's all right.
It's all right? It's all right.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.300
Sure, Homer, I can loan
you the money you need.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.100
However, since you
have no collateral...

05:32.900 --> 05:34.900
...I'm gonna have to break your legs
in advance.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.100
Gosh, Moe.
I use these all the time.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.800
- Couldn't you bash my head in?
- Hey, are you a loan shark?

05:40.200 --> 05:42.300
Do you understand
how finance works?

05:42.500 --> 05:44.400
Now, let's do this thing.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.700
- Oh, no. It's P.E. Sign-up day.
- How could you forget?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.900
They had signs posted
all over the library.

05:56.100 --> 05:59.800
Better sign up for something fast, man.
Baseball just filled up...

06:00.000 --> 06:02.500
So did tae kwon do.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.100
There's only one class left...

06:13.300 --> 06:16.000
...but it happens to be
the coolest one of all.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.700
Ballet? Dancing is for girls.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.900
Well, you should've gotten here earlier.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
I need an extension
on my mortgage payments.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.500
I understand, Mr. Simpson,
but according to our computer...

06:28.700 --> 06:30.300
...your credit history is not good.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.700
It says here that you've been
pre-declined for every major credit card.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.400
It also says that you grabbed a dog
by the hind legs...

06:36.700 --> 06:39.400
...and pushed him like a vacuum.
- In the third grade!

06:39.600 --> 06:41.300
It all goes on your permanent record.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.700
Sorry, but if you don't have
that money by tomorrow...

06:44.000 --> 06:46.500
...the bank will take your house.
- Good luck finding it.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.700
- I'll take the numbers off.
- We'll find a house with no numbers.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.700
I'll take off my neighbor's numbers.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.300
So then we'll look for the house next
to the house with no numbers.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.200
All right, you'll get your money.

06:58.500 --> 07:02.100
You're my last, last chance, bottom
of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot...

07:02.500 --> 07:05.700
...wish you would, but probably won't,
final resort to lend me money.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.800
- We'll take care of you.
- Yes. Care.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.300
Cut him a check
and get him the hell out of here.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.500
What a wonderful dinner.
What a beautiful family.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.600
Get a picture of me with this steak.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.700
You're certainly in a good mood, Dad.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.100
Well, Lisa, I managed to solve
a little problem today.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.100
And to celebrate,
I'm going to tilt my chair.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.000
Slanty.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.400
Patty, Selma.
What are you doing here?

07:58.700 --> 08:00.500
We thought we'd stop by
unexpectedly for dinner.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.500
Now, bring us extra chairs
like a good "blubber"-in-law.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.100
Time to fertilize the lawn.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.100
A couple of 500-pound bags
should do it!

08:09.200 --> 08:11.100
Be careful with my sisters' heads.
Their necks are brittle.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.100
That's okay, Marge.
Nothing's broke.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.200
Except Homer.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.600
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

08:18.900 --> 08:24.100
It means these two fabulous babes
are staying for dinner.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.100
Now, there's a stink
I could've done without.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.900
This has been such a nice,
peaceful dinner.

08:30.100 --> 08:34.200
It calls for a celebration. I'll make the
most international coffee in the house:

08:34.500 --> 08:37.299
Montreal Morn.

08:38.900 --> 08:41.100
All right, you had your fun,
now get lost.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.799
Our fun hasn't begun yet.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.700
We know something
you don't want Marge to know.

08:49.900 --> 08:53.800
Now we own you,
like Siegfried owns Roy.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.100
I'm sorry. All we have is NescafÃ©.

08:58.100 --> 09:01.600
- I'm very, very sorry.
- Oh, Marge, Marge. You're just in time.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.400
Homer's getting ready
to give us a foot rub.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.900
- You are?
- No! L...

09:08.700 --> 09:11.500
I'm giving them a foot massage.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.700
At least let me have that.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.800
You can start with the corns.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.400
Then you can move on
to bunion country.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.300
Okay. Steady, Bart.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.500
Taking ballet doesn't make you
any less of a man.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.100
All right, girls. Today we learn
the dance of the fairy queens.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.900
You can either be a fairy or a queen.
It's wide open.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.600
And what have we here?

09:40.800 --> 09:43.700
A young man maybe who thinks
he can be the next Baryshnikov.

09:43.900 --> 09:47.500
I don't wanna be the next anything.
They made me take this stupid class.

09:47.900 --> 09:51.400
So he has fire in the belly.
But it will take more than belly fire...

09:51.600 --> 09:55.300
...to be the next Baryshnikov!
- Look, Boris, I think ballet's for sissies.

09:56.300 --> 09:58.800
Ballet is for the strong,
the fierce, the determined.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.000
But for the sissies, never.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.900
Now, put on this fuchsia-tard.
You are a fairy!

10:06.700 --> 10:08.500
- Quitting time.
- On the way home...

10:08.700 --> 10:11.900
...we'll stop at Moe's for a Zima.
- Maybe I'll stay and work overtime.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.000
My sisters-in-law
are at my house again.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.700
Homer, quit wallowing in self-pity.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.300
Pull yourself together
and come get drunk with us.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.300
- Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?
- I don't like wearing tights.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.000
But so many of your heroes
wear tights.

10:31.300 --> 10:35.400
- Batman, for example. And Magellan.
- Look, I don't like this cootie platoon...

10:35.700 --> 10:39.000
...and I never will. I'm out of here,
and I'm out of this stupid outfit.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.600
Wait!
Joy of movement, increasing.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.800
Love of dance, impossible to resist.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.900
Toes twinkling. Look at me, girls.

10:52.900 --> 10:56.100
I'm doing ballet. And I love it!

10:58.800 --> 11:01.700
Am I wrong,
or did it just get fatter in here?

11:02.100 --> 11:05.700
- Request permission to slink by.
- Permission pending.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.400
First, light our cigarettes.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.300
But you're already smoking cig...

11:13.400 --> 11:16.100
- You're really pushing it.
- Come on, Homer.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.500
You can't spell "obsequious"
without l-O-U.

11:19.700 --> 11:22.700
- I'll have to trust you on that.
- Marge was always a good speller.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.100
- Let's ask her.
- No! Don't tell Marge!

11:25.300 --> 11:27.400
I'll be good. I'll be good.

11:32.500 --> 11:37.100
Just for that, you have to crawl around
on the floor like the dog you are.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.400
But... Yes, ma'am.

11:41.300 --> 11:46.400
Now say, "I am Homer Simpson,
the lowly dog. " In a dog voice!

11:46.800 --> 11:50.000
- I am Homer Simpson.
- Well, good. Jump, Homer, jump.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.200
- What's going on in here?
- Absolutely nothing, Marge.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.700
- What's that paper?
- What paper?

11:59.500 --> 12:02.700
Homer, is this projection accurate?

12:02.600 --> 12:05.300
- Did you borrow money from my sisters?
- I don't know, Marge.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.000
I can't keep track
of all my wheelings and dealings.

12:08.300 --> 12:12.000
- He blew your savings on jack-o'-lanterns.
- You told!

12:17.500 --> 12:18.900
Sorry, Marge.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.100
I never want to see you again!
You either.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.500
Homer.
Homer, why didn't you tell me?

12:26.700 --> 12:30.100
I was ashamed, Marge.
I failed you as a husband and a provider.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.700
And at best, I was a B-plus dog.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.000
I'll understand if you wanna sleep
on the couch tonight.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.900
- How's Dad today?
- Not too good, Lisa.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.100
- Frankly, he's underneath the table.
- Nobody make me any breakfast.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.600
A man so deeply in debt
doesn't deserve it.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.900
But I like to make you breakfast.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.800
In that case, I'll just have French toast
with double butter and a side of bacon.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.300
But no powdered sugar, I don't deserve it.
Maybe a little powdered sugar.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.000
See that?
I started to do, like, a little arabesque.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.800
But then I just fully went for it
and pulled off the demi-entrechat.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.700
Not that I'm into that kind of thing.

13:18.100 --> 13:21.900
Bravissimo, Bart!
Next week, class gives its first recital.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.500
And you, you will dance the male lead.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.000
Dance in front of my whole school?
What is it with you and ballet?

13:29.200 --> 13:32.300
I know you have great conflict, Bart.
You love ballet.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.800
Yet you feel the boys
will laugh at you, no?

13:36.400 --> 13:37.700
No, I fear the girls
will laugh at me.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.700
I fear the boys will beat
the snot out of me.

13:42.100 --> 13:45.300
- Hey, Dad. What you doing?
- Daddy has very important work to do.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
He's looking through the want ads
to find a part-time job.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.800
Dad, that's a gag paper
we got at the carnival.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.900
No wonder I didn't hear about Bart being
elected world's greatest sex machine.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.800
- I'll never pay off that debt!
- Need money fast?

13:58.100 --> 14:00.200
Got no experience?
Step up to elegance.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.600
- Become a limo driver at Classy Joe's.
- That's it!

14:03.800 --> 14:07.800
I'll make money with a chauffeur job!
Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.000
I didn't turn it on, I thought you did.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.600
No. Well, anyway, turn it off.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.200
It is off.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.200
You have to work hard
to win this crowd over.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.700
- Most of them are here for detention.
- Pretty big crowd.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.600
We even bused in troublemakers
from other schools.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.000
That spiky-haired, masked dancer
is really something.

14:42.300 --> 14:45.800
- I wonder who he is.
- He's graceful, yet masculine.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.200
So it's okay for me to enjoy this.

14:48.300 --> 14:52.100
This reminds me of the movie Fame,
and to a lesser extent...

14:52.400 --> 14:56.000
...the TV series,
which was also called Fame.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.700
Oh, wow, I can't believe my very first
passenger is comedy legend Mel Brooks.

15:03.900 --> 15:07.300
I loved that movie Young Frankenstein.
Scared the hell out of me.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.500
- Thanks.
- Let's do that 2000-pound-man thing.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.600
I'll be that Carl Reiner guy,
and you be what's-his-face.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.200
It's not easy.
It takes the genius of Carl Reiner...

15:18.400 --> 15:19.900
...and the timing that only we...

15:20.600 --> 15:22.600
Sir, today, every country
has a national anthem.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.900
Did they have national anthems
2000 years ago?

15:26.100 --> 15:28.700
Sure! Sure we had.
Of course, we was caves.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.000
But every cave had a national anthem.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.900
I'll never forget
my cave's national anthem.

15:34.200 --> 15:40.100
- What was that national anthem?
- Let them all go to hell except Cave 76

15:41.400 --> 15:43.700
What's with the si...?
What's with the siren?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.900
Evening, Simpson.
Got a short in your taillight.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.700
Started blinking
when you made that turn.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.900
- Let's see your chauffeur's license.
- Chauffeur's license, eh?

15:53.300 --> 15:54.600
Mel, buckle your borscht belt!

15:57.800 --> 15:59.900
Since you're trying to make
a getaway in park...

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
...I'm guessing you don't
have a license.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.100
Better head to the DMV.
These two broads'll help you out.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.700
Wow. Officer, this man
is making me a little edgy.

16:11.100 --> 16:15.100
- Could you give me a ride to the airport?
- Hey, hey! You're Mel Brooks!

16:15.400 --> 16:17.800
- Sure, I'll give you a ride.
- Thank you.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.300
On the way we can do that
2000-dollar-man thing.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.100
You be Carl Reiner,
and I'll be Police Chief Wiggum.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.900
Listen, why don't you play Carl Reiner,
and let me play Police Chief Wiggum.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.600
I hate Carl Reiner!

16:33.100 --> 16:35.900
I haven't been moved like this
since The Joy Luck Club.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.500
They love me. I'm accepted.
I don 't need this mask anymore.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.000
Behold! The masked dancer is me, Bart!

16:49.200 --> 16:52.800
- It is I who have won your acclaim!
- Bart does ballet!

16:52.900 --> 16:55.100
He dances like girls!

16:55.800 --> 16:58.600
Go ahead and laugh. I took a chance
and did what I wanted to do.

16:58.900 --> 17:04.300
And if that makes me a sissy,
well, then, I guess I'm a sissy.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.099
He's a sissy! Let's rush him!

17:07.400 --> 17:09.000
- Yeah!
- Yeah, let's get him, come on!

17:10.700 --> 17:13.200
After him! Go!

17:14.800 --> 17:18.400
- There he is! There, right there!
- Bart, use the ballet. Leap!

17:18.700 --> 17:22.500
Leap like you've never leapt before!

17:29.300 --> 17:32.400
Looks like he took a pretty bad spill.

17:32.700 --> 17:35.600
Well, as long as he's hurt.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.900
Bart, I am so proud of you. You've
shown a sensitive side of yourself...

17:41.100 --> 17:45.100
...that can never be erased. From this
day forward, we are kindred spirits.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.800
Why'd she just leave me here
when I clearly need medical attention?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.200
Stupid driving test at the stupid DMV...

17:56.300 --> 17:58.400
...where stupid Patty
and stupid Selma work.

17:58.700 --> 18:03.200
Sometimes I think God is teasing me,
just like he teased Moses in the desert.

18:02.700 --> 18:06.800
Tested, Homer. God tested Moses.
And try to be nice to my sisters.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.300
It's very hard on me
to have you always fighting.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.700
Oh, okay, Marge.
I'll get along with them.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.300
Then I will hug some snakes.

18:13.600 --> 18:18.000
Yes! I will hug and kiss
some poisonous snakes!

18:18.200 --> 18:19.400
Now, that's sarcasm.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.000
Well, well, well.
Look who needs us again...

18:23.800 --> 18:25.600
...to get his chauffeur's license.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.700
Look, all I ask is that you be fair.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.100
Did not adjust side mirror.
Minus one point.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.300
Failed to check blind spot.
Minus two points.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.100
You'll be happy when my
family thinks I'm a loser.

18:34.900 --> 18:38.000
You are a loser, Homer!
And we're winners. You gotta learn that.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.400
Seat belt twisted. Minus one point.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.800
Nagging the driver.
Minus 10 points for you!

18:43.500 --> 18:45.800
- Grazed a cone. Minus five.
- Being a jerk. Minus a million!

18:47.900 --> 18:51.600
One more wrong answer, and Homer
flunks another of life's little tests.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.000
And what's this?

18:54.300 --> 18:57.200
Someone didn't fill in a circle
all the way.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.100
- Oh, boy. Oh, that felt good.
- Let me try. Let me try.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.500
Yeah. Oh, boy.
Oh, that was so sweet.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.800
- So, Homer, how'd you do?
- Well, I...

19:14.400 --> 19:17.800
Ladies, please don't tell me
you're smoking in a government building.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.000
Because that is
the kind of infraction...

19:20.300 --> 19:22.700
...that can cost a couple of sisters
their promotion.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.700
- Well...
- What?

19:24.900 --> 19:27.500
- You mean...
- Why...

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Oh, you're talking about she...
Who's? What? She... What, this?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.500
I'll never forgive myself for this.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.400
Wait a minute. Those are yours, sir?

19:43.700 --> 19:47.000
Yes. I am in flavor country.

19:47.300 --> 19:50.600
- Both of them?
- It's a big country.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.100
Ladies, I apologize.
And you, sir, are worse than Hitler.

19:55.700 --> 19:59.100
Homer, I'm... I'm speechless.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.800
- You just saved our hides.
- On top of everything else...

20:02.400 --> 20:05.300
...don't make me picture your hides.
- It's a wonderful thing you did...

20:05.600 --> 20:07.700
...for my sisters.
- I didn't do it for them.

20:07.800 --> 20:11.000
I did it for you, Marge. I'd kill for you.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.100
- Please ask me to kill for you.
- No, Homie.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.100
You see? This is the stuff I've been
telling you about that you never see.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.300
Homer.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.800
We're... sorry.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.400
- If there's anything we can do...
- Call off the debt?

20:26.600 --> 20:29.500
Or, say, we could let you pass
your driver's test.

20:29.300 --> 20:30.900
Call off the debt?

20:31.200 --> 20:33.100
- Well...
- Debt's off! Let's go, Marge!
