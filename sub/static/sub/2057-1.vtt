01:29.255 --> 01:30.339
Hey!

01:35.678 --> 01:38.847
All the birds of a feather

01:39.015 --> 01:42.184
Do what we love most of all

01:42.352 --> 01:45.604
We are the best at rhythm and laughter

01:45.772 --> 01:47.689
That's why we love Carnaval!

01:49.067 --> 01:52.319
Call so clear we can sing to

01:52.487 --> 01:55.697
Sun and nature's big moon

01:55.865 --> 01:59.159
Dance to the music
Passion and love

01:59.327 --> 02:02.538
Show us the best you can do!

02:02.705 --> 02:05.874
Everyone here is on fire

02:06.042 --> 02:09.211
Get up and join in the fun

02:09.378 --> 02:12.714
Dance with a stranger
Romance and danger

02:12.882 --> 02:17.719
Magic can happen
For real in Rio

02:17.887 --> 02:20.639
All by itself!

02:21.141 --> 02:22.891
You can't see

02:23.226 --> 02:24.393
it coming

02:24.519 --> 02:27.729
You can't find it anywhere else!

02:27.897 --> 02:31.233
It's real in Rio

02:31.401 --> 02:34.528
And know something else

02:34.696 --> 02:36.155
You can't feel

02:36.739 --> 02:37.948
it happening

02:38.158 --> 02:40.576
You can't feel it all by yourself!

04:29.852 --> 04:33.772
It's okay. It's okay.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.197
I'll take care of you.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.192
Stupid clock.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.374
Good morning, Blu.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.433
Come here!

05:51.601 --> 05:52.976
Tyler Blu Gunderson!

05:53.144 --> 05:55.270
You know these vitamins are good for you.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.440
What's this?

05:59.442 --> 06:00.776
Gotcha!

06:37.688 --> 06:38.980
Enjoy the new book!

06:39.148 --> 06:40.315
Thanks, Linda!

06:40.483 --> 06:41.775
Bye, now.

06:41.943 --> 06:46.196
Yes, Mom, I'd love to visit,
but who would take care of Blu?

06:46.989 --> 06:49.825
Mom! They don't have kennels for parrots.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.493
Here's your hot chocolate, Blu!

06:52.662 --> 06:54.037
Just how you like it.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.416
Plus, I don't trust
leaving Blu with just anyone.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.501
No, I don't have a bird-sitter.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.712
This is the life.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.632
The perfect marshmallow-to-cocoa ratio.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.968
One, two, three, four, five, six.

07:15.351 --> 07:19.187
Well, well, if it isn't my favorite nerd bird.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.231
Very funny. Real mature.

07:21.357 --> 07:24.276
Hey, pet!
Where you migrating to this year?

07:24.360 --> 07:25.861
The breakfast nook?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.364
Throw all the snowballs you want.

07:29.532 --> 07:33.285
I'm protected by this magical force-field
called glass.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.454
It's what keeps us so toasty and warm
in here

07:35.538 --> 07:37.706
while you guys are out there
freezing your...

07:40.376 --> 07:41.460
Classy.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.102
Are you all right?

08:00.563 --> 08:02.772
I'm not really built for this weather.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.066
Are you looking for some books?

08:05.234 --> 08:07.736
Books? No. No.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.490
I have come 6,000 miles looking for him.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.036
Doctor of Ornithology?

08:17.246 --> 08:18.872
He's magnificent.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.794
Linda? Little help here. Linda!

08:27.757 --> 08:28.924
Wow!

08:29.091 --> 08:30.717
You're actually communicating.

08:30.801 --> 08:34.679
Yes! I introduced myself and shook
my tail feathers counter-clockwise

08:34.764 --> 08:36.431
thus deferring to his dominance.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.558
I did not get that at all.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.018
So, Dr. Monteiro...

08:40.102 --> 08:43.063
No "Doctor," please, just call me Tulio.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.941
You know,
your macaw is a very special bird.

08:46.108 --> 08:50.946
In fact, as far as we know,
Blu is the last male of his kind!

08:51.113 --> 08:52.113
Really?

08:52.240 --> 08:52.948
Yes,

08:53.032 --> 08:54.616
and recently, we found a female

08:54.742 --> 08:58.453
and our hope is to bring the two of them
together to save their species.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.166
Well, yeah, sure, when can she come over?

09:03.334 --> 09:05.293
No, no. She is in Brazil.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.963
Blu must come to Rio de Janeiro.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.967
Rio? Brazil?

09:12.927 --> 09:15.136
No. No, no, no.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.682
I never let Blu out of my sight.
He needs me.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.892
No. You misunderstand.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.185
It's all arranged.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.854
You will be with him
every step of the way.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.481
And I will be with you.

09:27.483 --> 09:31.069
Look, I know you're doing yourjob,
but I can't...

09:31.195 --> 09:33.572
Well, Blu is very particular.

09:33.656 --> 09:38.201
And we have our little routine here
and we're not big on travel.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.829
Heck, he doesn't even fly!

09:40.997 --> 09:42.497
But of course he can fly!

09:42.623 --> 09:44.499
He's a perfect specimen.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.001
What are you doing?

09:46.127 --> 09:48.086
Don't worry, their natural instincts
always take over.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.671
Wait, wait, wait! No, no!

09:51.549 --> 09:53.091
Well, almost always.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.342
Blu!

09:55.344 --> 09:56.761
What kind of doctor are you?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.346
Are you okay?

09:58.514 --> 10:00.015
Perhaps, he's too domesticated.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.603
It was very nice of you to stop in
and squawk around

10:04.687 --> 10:06.146
and throw my bird.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.647
But now it's time for you to go.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.941
I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry, but...

10:10.026 --> 10:11.901
Wait, wait, Linda. Linda!

10:12.445 --> 10:14.070
This could be our last chance.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.365
Have a safe flight.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.244
Linda, please, listen to me.

10:21.746 --> 10:25.915
If we don't do this,
his whole species will be gone!

10:31.088 --> 10:32.797
Just think about it.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.138
Natural instincts!

10:40.222 --> 10:43.308
There is nothing natural about being
thrown halfway across the room.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.768
Well, I'll show him.

10:45.728 --> 10:46.936
I can do this.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.563
I just have to work out the physics.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.815
I have quadrated my vector angles.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.817
I've adjusted for wind shear.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.569
Positive reinforcement.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.820
Good.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.782
Okay, let's see.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.700
Flaps open. Perfect.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.410
Landing gear. Check.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.746
Tail flaps. Operational.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.916
And, actually, not bad.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.918
This is it.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.461
Let's fly.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.632
Just keep it simple.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.635
Thrust, lift, drag and weight.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.180
Thrust, lift, drag, weight.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.015
Thrust, lift, drag... Wait!

11:28.938 --> 11:30.105
Blu?

11:39.448 --> 11:43.660
I promised I would always look out for you,
didn't I?

11:47.289 --> 11:50.041
And have I ever broken a promise?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.796
I'm scared, too

11:54.964 --> 11:59.634
but I wouldn't make you do this
if it wasn't the right thing to do.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.762
What do you say, Blu?

12:09.812 --> 12:12.063
That's my big, brave boy.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.650
And we'll be back home
before we even know it.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.766
Your turn, Blu!

12:47.850 --> 12:50.018
You don't want to get beak-burn.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.700
Whoa! What is going on here?

13:06.035 --> 13:08.703
- You arrived in time for Carnaval!
- Carnaval?

13:08.829 --> 13:11.289
Yes, it's the biggest party in the world.

13:11.373 --> 13:14.417
You know,
a time to have fun and dance!

13:16.045 --> 13:17.045
Oh, my!

13:18.214 --> 13:20.215
Is she a performer?

13:20.841 --> 13:23.134
No, in fact, she's my dentist.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.511
Dr. Barbosa!

13:25.721 --> 13:28.223
Don't forget to floss, Tulio!

13:28.891 --> 13:30.225
You got it!

13:30.392 --> 13:33.394
Come tomorrow night,
everyone will be dressed like that.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.522
Not me.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.074
Oh, right yeah.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.246
I am not from here.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.081
Hey, Nico, he's a tourist!

13:53.249 --> 13:54.582
Funny, you don't look like one.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.334
Really? I don't?

13:56.460 --> 13:58.962
Except you got pigeon doo-doo
on your nose.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.548
Oh, no, this is just SPF 3000.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.258
So, are you here for Carnaval?

14:03.425 --> 14:06.261
Actually, I'm just here to meet a girl.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.096
- A girl!
- Yes!

14:08.222 --> 14:10.765
Little word of advice,
you make the first move.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.851
Brazilian ladies respond to confidence.

14:12.935 --> 14:13.935
Right.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.605
Yeah, it's all about swagger.
You got to puff out that chest!

14:18.107 --> 14:19.107
Swing that tail!

14:19.900 --> 14:22.944
Eyes narrow,
like some kind of crazy love-hawk!

14:23.612 --> 14:25.530
- But first we got to bust you out.
- What?

14:25.614 --> 14:28.992
Yeah! I'm gonna pop that cage open
like a soda can!

14:29.451 --> 14:30.618
No, no. Wait!

14:30.786 --> 14:32.287
No, no, no, that's okay.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.956
You call that popping?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.791
This thing is robust.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.877
No, no, guys, really, I'm fine.
The cage is great.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.253
Love the cage!

14:40.671 --> 14:41.671
Suit yourself!

14:41.797 --> 14:43.631
Don't forget, love-hawk!

14:45.676 --> 14:47.302
Yes, yes, Bem...

14:47.636 --> 14:49.387
And to you, as well.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.820
This is the heart and soul of our aviary.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.155
Our treatment room.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.992
They really like you.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.494
A lot.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.039
Yes. I'm their great, big mama bird.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.338
Wow!

15:23.672 --> 15:24.672
Want some?

15:25.341 --> 15:26.341
I'm good.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.345
Many of the birds here
were rescued from smugglers.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.763
Smugglers?

15:31.847 --> 15:35.683
Yes! And unfortunately,
the poor birds are often hurt

15:35.809 --> 15:37.477
or even killed in the process.

15:37.561 --> 15:40.688
But with proper care, they can be saved.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.316
Look here.
This poor guy was found last night.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.737
Hey, buddy! You're looking great today.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.490
Much better, much better!

15:51.867 --> 15:53.159
Get well soon!

15:56.246 --> 15:57.747
So, where is Jewel?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.999
We have a special place for Jewel.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.876
She's a very spirited bird.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.878
I'll say.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.546
She did that?

16:05.714 --> 16:08.091
Charming. Okay, I want to go home now.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.009
No, no. Don't worry.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.804
I'm going to make you look irresistible.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.104
Help! Help! Let me out of here!

16:26.068 --> 16:27.068
Linda!

16:27.736 --> 16:30.697
- Maybe I should...
- No, no. Give it a chance.

16:41.417 --> 16:46.004
Hello?

16:48.757 --> 16:50.591
I come in peace.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.765
Whoa. She's beautiful.

17:00.811 --> 17:04.939
What were they talking about?
She's like an angel.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.486
An angel who's getting really close...

17:16.452 --> 17:17.785
You're standing on my throat.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.537
You're an American.

17:20.622 --> 17:23.624
Thanks. I need my throat for talking.
So, thank you.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.292
You look like me.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.336
Hi.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.130
Hi, my name is Blu.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.967
Like the cheese with the mold on it.
You know, that smells really bad.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.303
That's stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.805
Come on. We don't have much time.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.683
Wait, wait, wait.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.072
- Are you ready?
- For what?

17:54.281 --> 17:56.157
Wow. Okay.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.786
Confidence. Crazy love-hawk.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.163
All right.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.873
Whoa, what are you doing?

18:04.041 --> 18:05.666
What? What you wanted me to.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.753
But just for argument's sake,
what are you doing?

18:08.837 --> 18:11.339
I am trying to escape.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.510
Yeah, escape, that's where I was going
with that thing I just did.

18:15.803 --> 18:19.013
Wait, wait. Did you actually think
we were going to kiss?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.515
- No! It's not what you think.
- We just met.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.682
Oh, my.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.851
I think they need a little help.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.355
I know how my feathers look,
but I am not that kind of bird.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.943
Okay, I had nothing to do with that.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.113
But, you have to admit
it's actually a pretty good song.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.366
Naturally

18:38.450 --> 18:39.867
Yeah, sing it, Lionel.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.750
Wow. That was fast.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.212
Lionel Richie works every time.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.923
We should probably give them
some privacy.

19:00.055 --> 19:03.266
I'm not so sure
I should leave Blu here alone.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.851
No, don't worry.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.228
Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.985
Besides, he's got Jewel.

19:20.784 --> 19:21.909
Help me!

19:26.665 --> 19:29.292
This is the final countdown to Carnaval!

19:29.418 --> 19:30.877
Let's samba!

20:00.324 --> 20:03.117
Come here, poor little birdie.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.913
It's okay, I got you.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.456
I got you.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.980
Excuse me.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.067
Please, I am trying to sleep.

20:36.235 --> 20:40.655
I'm sorry, sleepy-head,
I'm trying to escape.

20:41.865 --> 20:44.492
Escape? Why?
This cage is awesome.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.826
This...

20:46.328 --> 20:47.995
What was I thinking?

20:48.205 --> 20:51.374
I wouldn't expect a pet to understand.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.834
Pet? Did you just call me a pet?

20:54.002 --> 20:55.962
For the record, I am not a pet.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.463
I am a companion.

20:57.547 --> 20:58.965
And you know what?
Do whatever you want

20:59.049 --> 21:01.050
'cause tomorrow morning,
Linda will come for me

21:01.176 --> 21:02.885
and this whole nightmare
will be over.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.220
Incredible!

21:04.346 --> 21:07.723
You would rather be with a human
than with your own kind.

21:07.891 --> 21:11.811
Well, that human has given me love
and affection for the past 15 years

21:11.895 --> 21:15.147
whereas my own kind try to strangle me
after 15 seconds.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.025
Yeah, well, because of them,
I've lost everything.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.694
You can't trust them.

21:19.861 --> 21:20.861
Of course...

21:21.029 --> 21:22.363
you can trust humans.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.992
Jewel? Jewel?

21:27.035 --> 21:28.035
Hi, there.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.548
It was nice of you to join me for dinner.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.800
I often eat alone.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.094
Because, of course, my work.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.472
I thought I was the bird nut until I met you.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.724
Yes, right.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.517
Do you have a favorite bird?

21:51.643 --> 21:55.563
Well, obviously,
I'm a blue macaw kind of gal.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.274
That makes sense.
They are very handsome birds.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.901
Actually, it's the brains
I'm more attracted to.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.738
I'm not so impressed
by fancy feathers.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.531
I know exactly what you mean.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.616
My favorite bird is the spotted owl.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.493
I've always been mesmerized

22:09.578 --> 22:11.078
by those big...

22:11.246 --> 22:14.248
round, intelligent eyes.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.586
Chicken hearts?

22:21.048 --> 22:23.799
Chicken hearts! Oh, gosh.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.312
Hello?

22:54.664 --> 22:56.665
Oh, Blu.

22:56.833 --> 23:00.169
We should have never left Moose Lake.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.296
This is all my fault.

23:02.381 --> 23:06.717
No, no, Linda, Linda, please.
This is not your fault.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.804
You're right.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.972
It's not my fault.

23:12.307 --> 23:13.724
- It's your fault!
- What?

23:13.809 --> 23:15.476
With your little bird talk.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.229
And that whole "save the species. "

23:18.397 --> 23:19.397
Well, you know what?

23:19.648 --> 23:21.899
Squawk, squawkity, squawk, squawk!

23:22.692 --> 23:24.902
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to curse.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.237
I don't understand.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.406
Sylvio is the best guard in the business.

23:28.615 --> 23:29.740
So, let me get this straight.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.034
You were attacked by a little white bird?

23:32.327 --> 23:34.328
Yes, with this rag.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.747
He held it to my mouth like this.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.631
We're doomed.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.892
Okay. There's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.602
How I wish I was back in my own cage

23:58.687 --> 24:01.772
with my mirror and my swing,
and my little bell.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.441
How I miss my little bell.

24:03.942 --> 24:04.942
Play dead.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.779
What? I don't need to play dead,
I'm about to have a heart attack.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.281
Just do it!

24:10.782 --> 24:11.907
Fine.

24:17.581 --> 24:18.581
Stop twitching.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.958
Come on, it's the twitching that sells it.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.089
Come on in, kid.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.307
Well, what do you know?

24:36.475 --> 24:37.975
Good work, Fernando.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.478
You see, boys?

24:40.687 --> 24:42.771
What did I tell you about this one?

24:43.440 --> 24:45.858
That you were going to pay him
half as much as you said?

24:45.942 --> 24:47.359
No, you idiot.

24:47.444 --> 24:50.488
That he reminds me of myself
when I was that age.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.823
Smart, resourceful.

24:52.991 --> 24:53.991
Here you go, kid.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.912
Hey. This is only half
of what you promised me.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.580
Shut up, kid.

24:59.789 --> 25:00.915
What the...

25:03.210 --> 25:06.253
I thought I told you
I needed these birds alive.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.630
Tell me, Fernando...

25:07.797 --> 25:09.757
does this look alive to you?

25:12.928 --> 25:13.427
Get her!

25:13.678 --> 25:14.678
Come over here!

25:15.722 --> 25:16.222
Jewel!

25:17.974 --> 25:18.974
Come here!

25:26.024 --> 25:27.107
Hello...

25:27.776 --> 25:29.026
pretty bird.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.736
What's the matter?

25:30.820 --> 25:32.071
Cockatoo got your throat?

25:32.155 --> 25:33.155
Nigel!

25:33.782 --> 25:35.658
Alive.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.785
To be continued.

25:42.999 --> 25:46.752
That was your plan?
To take off and leave me? Gee, thanks.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.796
Well, why didn't you follow me?

25:50.966 --> 25:52.550
Nice work, Nigel.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.552
Yeah, nice work, Nigel.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.680
The last blue macaws on earth.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.682
These are worth a fortune.

25:59.849 --> 26:03.185
Hey, Fernando,
hang these up in the other room.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.908
Hey, birdie!

26:18.159 --> 26:20.786
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out of here!

26:20.870 --> 26:21.996
Who's a pretty bird? I'm a pretty bird.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.665
Pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.
I'm a pretty bird.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.167
I was framed. They got the wrong guy.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.336
Sorry, guys. Nothing personal.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.266
So, what's going to happen to them?

26:42.350 --> 26:45.853
Don't worry, we're going to find
good homes for them.

26:46.855 --> 26:47.855
Now go home to your mama.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.189
But I don't have a mama.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.316
Father?

26:50.400 --> 26:52.109
- Brother?
- Goldfish?

26:53.194 --> 26:55.195
Can we keep him, boss?

26:56.031 --> 26:57.072
No.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.368
So, Marcel, what's really going to happen
to those birds?

27:01.745 --> 27:03.871
Plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares?

27:04.039 --> 27:06.707
All I know is we're going to be rich.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.335
We're gonna be rich!

27:57.175 --> 27:59.426
Come on, come on! The game is starting!

27:59.511 --> 28:03.013
Yes, you were very clear.
Tomorrow or the deal is off.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.265
Of course I have both the macaws.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.018
Yes, I will deliver them myself.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.022
All right, you two...

28:12.190 --> 28:13.273
you load the truck tonight.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.193
And first thing in the morning,
we bring those birds to the airport.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.486
You got it?

28:17.654 --> 28:19.488
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. Heard you.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.990
And one of you, feed Nigel.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.666
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

28:30.834 --> 28:31.667
Yes!

28:31.793 --> 28:34.128
Nuh-uh, scissors cuts rock.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.630
Oh, man. How come you always win?

28:40.510 --> 28:42.052
Nice birdie.

28:45.974 --> 28:46.974
Here you go.

28:56.151 --> 28:56.817
Cannibal.

28:58.653 --> 29:01.655
Okay, pull it together.
The key is not to panic.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.823
I'm not panicking.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.825
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to me.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.911
But it's okay, because any minute now,
Linda will find us.

29:07.996 --> 29:11.206
Great. And then she'll stick us behind
another set of bars, right?

29:11.332 --> 29:12.624
Yeah. I mean, no.

29:12.709 --> 29:17.254
Look, pet, cages might work for you,
but I don't want to belong to anyone.

29:24.971 --> 29:28.348
Something seems to be lodged in my beak.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.392
Would you mind?

29:44.783 --> 29:47.075
I know I'm not a pretty birdie...

29:47.202 --> 29:49.536
but I used to be quite a looker.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.538
A star.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.251
Lights, camera, action.

29:56.419 --> 29:59.630
I was striking,
suave, ambitious.

29:59.714 --> 30:00.756
Feet to beak...

30:01.132 --> 30:02.257
so birdie-licious

30:02.550 --> 30:05.052
Now I'm vile, I am villainous,
and vicious

30:05.136 --> 30:06.929
Oh, and malicious

30:07.096 --> 30:09.556
I had it all
A TV show, women, too

30:09.641 --> 30:12.351
I was tall
Over one-foot-two

30:12.435 --> 30:15.062
Then they got a
pretty parakeet to fill my shoes

30:15.230 --> 30:17.439
That's why I am so evil,
why I do what I do.

30:17.565 --> 30:18.607
He was a super star

30:18.733 --> 30:19.983
So young and vital

30:20.068 --> 30:21.151
He's nasty

30:21.236 --> 30:22.653
A South American Idol

30:22.737 --> 30:23.946
He's a suspicious bird

30:24.072 --> 30:25.197
Who said that about me?

30:25.281 --> 30:27.783
- A very vicious bird
- I'll have you rotisseried

30:27.909 --> 30:29.576
I'm a feathery freak
With a beak

30:29.661 --> 30:30.828
A bird murderer

30:30.912 --> 30:33.455
You think you're badder than me?
I never heard of ya

30:33.581 --> 30:36.083
I'm eviI,
I'll fill your cheese balls with weevils

30:36.167 --> 30:38.627
I poop on people
and I blame it on seagulls

30:39.754 --> 30:40.796
It was him.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.423
- He's a nasty bird
- I'm invincible

30:43.591 --> 30:45.926
- He's ghastly
- I'm un-mince-able

30:46.052 --> 30:48.428
I'm unwashable, unrinseable

30:48.555 --> 30:51.056
Like an abandoned school
I have no principle

30:51.182 --> 30:53.475
All of you Brazilian birds

30:53.601 --> 30:55.894
All 80 million birds

30:55.979 --> 30:58.355
I'll tell you what I'm going to do

30:58.439 --> 31:00.691
I'm going to make you

31:01.359 --> 31:02.943
Shut up, now. Shut up!

31:04.112 --> 31:05.279
It's just me.

31:05.446 --> 31:09.366
I will make you ugly...

31:10.118 --> 31:11.326
...too.

31:11.452 --> 31:12.411
Hey!

31:12.495 --> 31:13.579
Sweet nightmares.

31:16.624 --> 31:17.666
Not cool, man!

31:17.792 --> 31:19.626
Scary, but not cool!

31:20.461 --> 31:21.503
Hey, are you okay?

31:21.629 --> 31:24.298
No, I am definitely not okay!

31:24.382 --> 31:25.632
Wait. What are you doing?

31:25.800 --> 31:27.342
Getting out of here.

31:27.468 --> 31:28.886
Are you going to help me or what?

31:28.970 --> 31:32.723
Actually, all the survival guides say
to sit and wait, and help will come.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.224
No one is coming!

31:34.309 --> 31:37.811
We are on our own and if we just sit here,
we're going to die!

31:39.689 --> 31:41.481
Yes! Yes!

31:41.941 --> 31:42.608
Yes!

31:43.109 --> 31:44.234
No!

31:44.402 --> 31:46.737
Nigel! Get out of the way!

31:47.488 --> 31:48.488
Hold on!

31:48.990 --> 31:52.159
Stop! Stop!
Why don't you just open the door?

31:52.702 --> 31:53.785
Are you kidding me?

31:53.870 --> 31:55.621
What? It's just a standard flip slide bolt.

31:55.705 --> 31:56.747
Come on! Let's fly!

31:57.540 --> 31:58.624
What are you doing?

31:58.708 --> 32:00.667
- I can't.
- What? You can't what?

32:05.381 --> 32:08.008
I can't fly!

32:09.218 --> 32:11.178
You couldn't tell me this before now?

32:11.262 --> 32:13.055
It didn't matter before now!

32:16.517 --> 32:18.018
I hate you.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.481
Is there anything else I need to know?

32:22.565 --> 32:25.484
Yes, I can't fly, I pick my beak,
and once in a while I pee in the bird-bath.

32:25.568 --> 32:26.568
Happy?

32:26.694 --> 32:27.694
There they are!

32:27.779 --> 32:28.820
We got to get out of here!

32:29.030 --> 32:30.280
Just move! Move!

32:32.659 --> 32:34.076
Wait, wait. Listen to me.

32:34.243 --> 32:36.286
Flying may not be my thing,
but walking is.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.205
Follow my lead. Inside leg, outside leg.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.289
Yeah, okay, I got it.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.917
Inside, outside, inside, outside!

32:42.085 --> 32:45.420
Yes! Yes! Yes!

32:45.588 --> 32:47.714
- Yes. Yes!
- Come on!

32:56.307 --> 32:58.308
See? I'm bilingual, too!

33:03.106 --> 33:04.106
This is great!

33:04.232 --> 33:06.316
I'm chained to the only bird in the world
who can't fly!

33:06.401 --> 33:08.819
Actually, there are about 40 species
of flightless birds.

33:08.903 --> 33:10.278
- Duck!
- No, ducks can fly.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.738
No! Duck!

33:33.094 --> 33:45.439
Yes!

33:45.523 --> 33:46.773
Hold on!

33:47.608 --> 33:53.321
No!

34:02.874 --> 34:05.459
Get out of here, you putrid poultry!

34:23.478 --> 34:24.478
What was that?

34:24.562 --> 34:25.603
A stick.

34:25.688 --> 34:26.688
And that?

34:26.813 --> 34:27.938
It's just a rock.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.483
Right. Yeah.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.070
Is that a spider on my back?

34:33.154 --> 34:34.696
Will you quit it?

34:34.822 --> 34:37.032
It's just a leaf. Turn around.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.496
Leaf. Told you.

34:44.373 --> 34:47.250
Now, come on, we need to find
a safe place to spend the night.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.502
Safe? Safe?

34:48.668 --> 34:49.920
We are in the jungle.

34:50.004 --> 34:51.963
You know when people say,
"It's a jungle out there"?

34:52.047 --> 34:53.882
Well, I'm pretty sure
they don't mean it as a good thing.

34:54.007 --> 34:57.969
Look, I hate to break it to you,
but this is where our kind naturally lives.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.473
Hey, don't talk to me about nature.
I watch Animal Planet.

35:01.557 --> 35:03.725
I know all about the food chain.

35:07.021 --> 35:09.397
You see?
Out here, I'm just an hors d'oeuvre.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.525
Nothing more than a feathery spring roll.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.861
That is why we stay in the trees
and not on the ground.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.238
After you.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.032
No, I don't think so.

35:19.575 --> 35:23.537
No. I would feel much more comfortable
in something man-made.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.957
Hey, how about up there?

35:29.710 --> 35:33.130
I can't believe
I have to drag your clumsy butt up there.

35:33.714 --> 35:34.673
Drag me?

35:34.757 --> 35:36.258
Watch and learn.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.138
Blu! Just wait one...

35:41.430 --> 35:42.430
Blu?

35:43.224 --> 35:45.392
Who's dragging whose butt now?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.352
Very funny.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.611
You see? Who needs flying?

35:56.737 --> 35:59.239
Birds. Birds need flying.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.657
Flying is...

36:01.868 --> 36:05.078
It's freedom
and not having to rely on anyone.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.373
Don't you want that?

36:08.749 --> 36:11.585
I don't know.
It sounds a little lonely.

36:12.753 --> 36:13.920
Let's get some sleep.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.049
I'm probably going to be up
for a little while.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.468
Because I'm still on Minnesota time.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.137
Good night.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.472
Good night, Jewel.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.895
Good night, Linda.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.486
Excuse me, sir?

36:38.654 --> 36:43.116
Have you seen my bird?

36:46.787 --> 36:49.206
Excuse me?
Have you seen my bird?

37:24.450 --> 37:28.161
Have you seen my bird? Blue feather.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.996
Lady! American lady!

37:31.249 --> 37:32.666
- Blu?
- Where?

37:36.003 --> 37:38.421
Wow. I know where your birds are.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.715
You found Blu? Are you sure?

37:41.592 --> 37:42.592
It's his!

37:42.677 --> 37:43.885
Let me see that.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.017
You're right.

37:51.185 --> 37:52.769
Okay. Where is he?

37:52.979 --> 37:55.230
Come on, let's go! I'll take you to him.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.190
No, no. Linda, wait.

37:57.358 --> 38:00.694
We don't know this boy.
We can't trust him.

38:03.364 --> 38:06.032
I have to trust him.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.618
I don't have a choice.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.717
Do you think I'm an idiot?

38:25.344 --> 38:29.222
They were two birds
chained together in a cage.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.640
How could you lose them?

38:30.725 --> 38:34.519
They outsmarted us, boss.
But don't worry, we'll get them back.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.354
I have a plan.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.315
Great. What are you going to do?

38:38.399 --> 38:42.152
Wander the city calling
"Here birdie, birdie. Here birdie"?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.697
Well, anything sounds dumb
when you say it like that.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.367
Okay. We have to get the birds
to the airport tonight.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.412
But it's Carnaval.
All the roads will be blocked by the parade.

38:52.788 --> 38:55.790
And that's why
I wanted to go this morning.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.167
Nigel.

38:57.585 --> 39:01.004
This bird is 10 times smarter
than the two of you combined.

39:01.213 --> 39:04.716
Yeah, well, if he's so smart,
then why don't you put him in charge?

39:05.009 --> 39:06.760
I am putting him in charge.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.555
Stop suggesting things.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.724
Go find them, Nigel.

39:21.984 --> 39:26.613
If we can't get through the parade,
we'll have to be in the parade.

39:31.118 --> 39:33.161
Are you sure
this is going to work?

39:33.537 --> 39:35.622
Positive. Check out my math.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.542
Yeah, that's comforting. Thank you.

39:39.668 --> 39:42.045
Look, let's just get this chain broken.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.297
Right. Then we can go and find Linda.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.674
No, you can go find Linda.

39:46.842 --> 39:50.553
Once this chain is off, I'm going to go
back to being free in the jungle. Deal?

39:50.638 --> 39:51.679
Fine. Deal.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.356
Nice try, brainiac.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.361
I think something is watching us.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.203
Be careful, Blu.
They might snuggle you to death.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.040
Come here.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.004
Intruders!

40:25.339 --> 40:27.048
Cut it out!

40:29.760 --> 40:30.760
Now stop...

40:33.222 --> 40:35.223
No! Don't!

40:37.601 --> 40:38.601
Attack!

40:41.021 --> 40:42.063
Help!

40:42.148 --> 40:43.690
What's going on down there?

40:45.568 --> 40:47.068
Go, go. Off with you.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.194
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

40:48.362 --> 40:49.904
I've told you a thousand times.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.698
Manoela, Sofia, come on now, listen to me.

40:51.782 --> 40:52.949
Oh, yeah, right in the eye.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.160
Precious, aren't they?

40:55.494 --> 40:57.996
Kids? Seventeen of them
and one on the way.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.124
Hey! He's not a maraca, stop shaking him!

41:03.544 --> 41:05.920
They're giving me gray feathers.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.339
This papa needs a break.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.842
So, you two lovebirds headed for Carnaval?

41:11.760 --> 41:13.636
- Lovebirds?
- We're more like acquaintance-birds.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.306
Not even that, we're more like
chained-to-each-other birds.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.974
Yeah. I mean, if...

41:19.435 --> 41:20.894
What is it with this kid and the feathers?

41:20.978 --> 41:23.646
We have no idea. We're having him tested.

41:23.856 --> 41:27.901
So, do you think you could help us
get this thing off?

41:29.361 --> 41:34.157
Lucky for you, you know Rafael,
and Rafael knows everyone.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.910
Again with the eye.
Okay, want me to call your mother?

41:37.036 --> 41:38.328
No!

41:38.412 --> 41:40.497
Works every time.
They're scared to death of her.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.540
Call me for what?

41:42.708 --> 41:43.833
Eva, my love...

41:44.335 --> 41:46.503
I must take this young couple to see Luiz.

41:46.587 --> 41:47.795
Luiz!

41:47.880 --> 41:50.089
You don't fool me for a second.

41:50.299 --> 41:53.259
You and your amigo
just want to sneak off to Carnaval.

41:54.428 --> 41:55.762
Carnaval.

41:55.930 --> 42:00.433
That magical time when I met
the most beautiful bird in the world.

42:02.686 --> 42:07.106
I still remember the song that was playing
when I first laid eyes on you.

42:07.483 --> 42:10.860
Tall and tan and
young and lovely

42:10.945 --> 42:14.781
The girl from Ipanema
goes walking

42:14.907 --> 42:15.949
Come on, baby, sing it!

42:16.116 --> 42:19.994
And when she passes,
each one she passes goes, ah!

42:22.957 --> 42:25.250
Like a river of the sweetest honey.

42:26.293 --> 42:27.961
I guess love is deaf, too.

42:28.128 --> 42:29.546
Come here.

42:32.841 --> 42:37.136
Okay. Take them to Luiz, but hurry back.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.763
You are an angel.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.890
I'll miss you my juicy little mango.

42:41.058 --> 42:44.227
I'll miss you my pudgy papaya.

42:44.395 --> 42:47.772
Hey! Marco! Carlos!
Put your brother down, now!

42:47.940 --> 42:49.816
I can't believe she actually let me go.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.985
So, how far is this Luiz?

42:52.152 --> 42:55.488
Not far. Thirty minutes as the crow flies.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.740
And how long as the macaw walks?

42:57.825 --> 43:00.410
- Bobo here can't fly.
- But he's a bird.

43:00.494 --> 43:01.327
Not all birds fly.

43:01.453 --> 43:02.161
There are ostriches...

43:02.496 --> 43:03.496
You're not an ostrich.

43:03.622 --> 43:05.164
- Not technically, but...
- Wait.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.667
My friends, I want to help,
but to walk the whole way...

43:07.793 --> 43:08.793
It can't be done!

43:08.877 --> 43:09.919
Where's Daddy?

43:10.004 --> 43:11.921
- Daddy? Daddy?
- Come over here. Go back to your room.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.006
But, hey.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.091
We might as well give it a shot.
Let's go quickly.

43:15.175 --> 43:17.468
No, don't look back. They sense fear.

43:43.537 --> 43:45.121
What an adorable monkey.

44:02.473 --> 44:03.681
Hey! My watch!

44:30.084 --> 44:31.250
Hello, boys.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.836
Seems like you've had a busy day.

44:34.004 --> 44:35.088
What? This?

44:35.255 --> 44:39.092
This is just some stuff we found.
Right, boys?

44:39.176 --> 44:40.468
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:40.552 --> 44:42.970
I'm not interested
in your nicked knick-knacks.

44:43.055 --> 44:45.932
Your burgled baubles bore me.

44:46.016 --> 44:48.518
There are two blue macaws out there

44:48.602 --> 44:52.438
and I need your multitude of eyes
to help me find them.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.274
Yeah? What's in it for us?

44:55.859 --> 44:57.402
Well, that's a fair question.

45:02.741 --> 45:04.200
Let's discuss it.

45:07.079 --> 45:11.791
I certainly see your point, but what
could I possibly do for you in return?

45:11.959 --> 45:13.793
Save me! Save me!

45:14.211 --> 45:16.129
Well, that's a thought. Yeah.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.798
But is it enough? I don't want
to feel like I'm cheating you.

45:18.882 --> 45:20.383
Help me! Help me! No, no!

45:20.467 --> 45:22.635
We'll do it, we'll do it. Save me, please.

45:23.011 --> 45:25.263
Save me!

45:27.307 --> 45:28.975
All right, you've twisted my wing.

45:29.143 --> 45:30.518
Deal.

45:30.644 --> 45:33.146
Now then? Any more questions?

45:33.772 --> 45:35.273
No? Good.

45:35.441 --> 45:39.402
You will spread out and you will find
these macaws by the end of the day

45:39.486 --> 45:41.654
or it's flying lessons for everyone!

45:41.822 --> 45:43.030
Go!

45:45.617 --> 45:48.035
Go do your monkey business.

46:03.135 --> 46:05.511
I've changed my mind, yeah.

46:05.804 --> 46:08.181
Maybe we can find a bus schedule
or something.

46:08.265 --> 46:10.183
Come on, you're not going to back out now.

46:10.517 --> 46:12.518
Not in front of the lady.

46:14.354 --> 46:16.189
Okay, yeah. Yeah, sure.

46:16.356 --> 46:17.857
All right, that's the spirit.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.484
You're sure you're up for this?

46:19.568 --> 46:20.943
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

46:21.028 --> 46:24.614
it's not like we're just hurling
ourselves off a mountain or something.

46:24.698 --> 46:25.698
Right?

46:25.783 --> 46:27.784
Actually that was
pretty much my entire plan.

46:27.868 --> 46:28.868
What?

46:28.952 --> 46:31.537
Don't worry, Blu, it's in your DNA.

46:31.622 --> 46:33.998
And if our featherless friends can do it,
how hard can it be?

46:34.082 --> 46:35.333
Wait, wait!

46:37.377 --> 46:39.295
Mommy!

46:39.463 --> 46:40.588
Fun, right?

46:40.672 --> 46:42.298
Yeah. Fun.

46:43.091 --> 46:45.468
Okay. I need you two to get closer.

46:46.637 --> 46:51.224
Closer.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.185
Nice.

46:54.603 --> 46:55.895
Now put your wings around each other.

46:56.313 --> 46:57.897
- What?
- Come on, amigo!

46:58.023 --> 46:59.816
It's not like she's going to bite!

46:59.900 --> 47:00.900
Will you?

47:01.068 --> 47:02.235
We'll see.

47:02.444 --> 47:03.110
Now,

47:03.195 --> 47:04.320
you flap your right wing,

47:04.404 --> 47:08.366
you flap your left wing,
and together you fly.

47:08.659 --> 47:11.661
But this doesn't seem
aerodynamically possible.

47:12.913 --> 47:14.247
You think too much.

47:14.373 --> 47:18.751
Flying is not what you think up here,
it's what you feel in here.

47:18.877 --> 47:22.338
And when you feel the rhythm
of your heart, it's like samba.

47:22.422 --> 47:23.923
You fly!

47:28.846 --> 47:30.513
See? It's easy!

47:30.681 --> 47:31.681
Easy?

47:31.765 --> 47:33.516
Easy for you to say, because from here

47:33.600 --> 47:35.935
it looks really, really hard.

47:36.103 --> 47:40.064
Hey, if you want to see Linda again,
this is the only way.

47:40.357 --> 47:41.858
Okay. You're right.

47:41.942 --> 47:43.276
- Yes, I am.
- This is for Linda.

47:43.402 --> 47:44.527
- Right.
- Keep it simple.

47:44.611 --> 47:46.946
- Easy breezy.
- Thrust, lift, drag...

47:47.072 --> 47:48.197
- Come on! Let's go!
- Wait!

47:48.282 --> 47:50.533
- Inside, outside, inside, outside.
- Inside, outside, inside, outside.

47:50.617 --> 47:51.701
Come on, Blu! You can do it!

47:51.785 --> 47:52.869
I can do it. I can do it.

47:52.953 --> 47:53.536
I can do it.

47:53.620 --> 47:55.162
I can't do it!

47:55.956 --> 47:56.956
Not again!

48:07.968 --> 48:09.385
- Am I dead?
- No!

48:09.469 --> 48:11.178
We're still alive!

48:21.982 --> 48:25.443
Wow! This is incredible.

48:37.247 --> 48:38.247
Wow.

48:38.332 --> 48:41.208
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.252
See what you've been missing?

48:43.337 --> 48:45.004
Yeah.

48:50.677 --> 48:53.012
All right, Blu, you're flying!

48:53.138 --> 48:56.015
Sort of. Not really, but do you feel it?

48:56.224 --> 48:57.266
Yes!

48:58.185 --> 48:59.810
I do feel it.

49:13.158 --> 49:14.742
No, no, Blu! Wait!

49:26.463 --> 49:28.005
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

49:29.257 --> 49:30.758
We're gonna die!

49:57.911 --> 50:00.496
You did not feel it in here.

50:00.664 --> 50:01.914
You think?

50:04.251 --> 50:06.085
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

50:08.880 --> 50:09.588
Hurry, you two!

50:11.216 --> 50:12.258
Okay.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.385
Last of the species here.

50:14.928 --> 50:16.012
Move it!

50:16.096 --> 50:17.596
Hey. Wait up.

50:17.723 --> 50:18.806
Come on, lovebirds!

50:21.435 --> 50:22.935
You made it.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.730
I would love to go five minutes
without almost getting killed.

50:25.814 --> 50:26.939
Is that too much to ask?

50:27.024 --> 50:29.859
For a bird who can't fly, yeah.

50:35.323 --> 50:37.450
They're starting to close off the streets
for Carnaval.

50:37.909 --> 50:41.370
You better be right, kid.
Because we're running out of time.

50:53.341 --> 50:55.384
I'll never be able to get my car
through this crowd.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.094
Don't worry, I'm on it.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.099
Watch it!

51:02.934 --> 51:04.560
Hey, kid, how did you get this bike?

51:04.644 --> 51:06.854
- I traded it for your Jeep.
- What?

51:06.980 --> 51:09.273
Yeah, it's in great condition.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.401
Well, good condition!

51:13.361 --> 51:14.487
Hey! Out of the way!

51:15.113 --> 51:16.113
Look out!

51:18.158 --> 51:19.658
Hold on!

51:34.007 --> 51:36.759
I'm going to chew through my own leg
if this doesn't come off soon.

51:36.843 --> 51:39.595
Relax. If I know Luiz,
we're right where we want to be.

51:39.679 --> 51:40.971
Hey! Rafi!

51:41.181 --> 51:43.682
If it isn't the king of Carnaval!

51:43.809 --> 51:45.976
Nico! Pedro! What up, family?

51:46.144 --> 51:47.812
Where you been hiding yourself, bird?

51:47.896 --> 51:49.188
Man, I thought you were dead.

51:49.272 --> 51:51.148
Hold up! Rewind.

51:51.817 --> 51:53.526
Ain't that the bird from the cage?

51:53.610 --> 51:56.028
I think our love lessons went down smooth.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.321
You work fast.

51:57.405 --> 51:58.531
Baby got beak.

51:58.657 --> 52:01.367
You was locked up
and now you're rolling with a hot-wing.

52:01.451 --> 52:02.785
I want to be like you.

52:02.869 --> 52:05.329
No, it's not what you think.
We're just chained together.

52:05.413 --> 52:06.789
Hey, I'm not judging you.

52:06.873 --> 52:08.541
- Keep it spicy.
- Oh, yeah.

52:09.209 --> 52:10.709
Hey, guys, we're looking for Luiz.
Have you seen him?

52:11.294 --> 52:13.462
Yeah, I seen him, but you didn't,
because you just missed him.

52:13.547 --> 52:15.631
He took the trolley back to the garage.

52:15.715 --> 52:16.715
Great.

52:16.842 --> 52:19.051
Relax, baby bird.
You could catch the next one.

52:19.177 --> 52:21.220
Yeah, it's time to take it to the next level.

52:21.638 --> 52:22.888
What's wrong with this level?

52:22.973 --> 52:25.516
Come on! This ain't the level.
The next level's the level.

52:25.725 --> 52:27.143
You got to shake your tail feathers.

52:27.227 --> 52:28.978
We got to get this chain off first.

52:29.062 --> 52:32.398
Come on, lovebirds! You're in Rio!
You should enjoy it!

52:32.482 --> 52:34.692
Yeah! Live a little.

52:55.672 --> 52:57.423
We got them.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.426
Hey!

53:05.765 --> 53:08.184
Welcome to paradise!

53:08.894 --> 53:10.269
Some party, huh?

53:10.395 --> 53:12.188
This is the coolest place I've ever seen.

53:12.272 --> 53:15.024
Despite all the obvious
health code violations.

53:15.734 --> 53:18.777
I like you!
Nothing you say makes any sense.

53:19.946 --> 53:21.405
All right, everyone, listen up!

53:21.489 --> 53:24.116
Rafi has some special guests
from out of town

53:24.242 --> 53:28.037
and let's show them some love,
because I don't think they get out much.

53:29.039 --> 53:32.625
Everybody put their wings together
and clap them as loud as you can.

53:32.751 --> 53:35.628
Flap them. Clap them.
I don't care, slap them.

53:37.255 --> 53:39.048
Party in the Ipanema, baby.

53:42.052 --> 53:48.974
I wanna party
I wanna samba

53:49.434 --> 53:51.185
I wanna party

53:51.269 --> 53:53.145
- And live my life
- My life

53:53.230 --> 53:55.231
- I wanna party
- Party

53:55.315 --> 53:57.441
And fly

53:57.609 --> 54:00.527
High! I'm gonna fly
Fly just like a bird

54:00.612 --> 54:01.654
But you are a bird

54:01.738 --> 54:04.698
Oh, yeah, you're right
So let me fly just like a rocket then

54:04.783 --> 54:06.283
- Okay
- Fly so high

54:06.368 --> 54:08.452
Where I need to come down for oxygen

54:08.954 --> 54:12.164
'Cause once we start it
Baby, ain't no, ain't no stopping then

54:12.999 --> 54:16.085
'Cause I just want to live my life
and party

54:16.544 --> 54:19.255
All I want is to be free
And rock my body

54:19.339 --> 54:20.339
Okay

54:20.548 --> 54:21.840
I've been around the world

54:21.925 --> 54:24.093
And I want to live my life in Rio

54:24.177 --> 54:26.553
'Cause I Rio, 'cause I Rio realize

54:26.638 --> 54:27.972
What are you doing?

54:28.139 --> 54:29.598
I don't know.

54:30.767 --> 54:31.976
All right, Blu!

54:32.143 --> 54:33.519
And fly!

54:34.437 --> 54:38.107
I'm that samba, samba master
Master, master, master, master

54:38.191 --> 54:42.027
Push out sound from a ghetto blaster
Blaster, blaster, blaster, blaster

54:42.529 --> 54:44.071
Hey. She likes you.

54:44.155 --> 54:46.031
What are you talking about?
Haven't you been listening?

54:46.116 --> 54:47.700
No, but I've been watching.

54:47.909 --> 54:49.952
Just be yourself. Go on.

54:50.787 --> 54:52.288
- I wanna samba
- Party

54:52.372 --> 54:53.998
- I wanna party
- Party

54:54.082 --> 54:55.833
- I wanna samba
- Party

54:55.917 --> 54:57.876
- I wanna party
- Party

54:57.961 --> 54:59.920
- And live my life
- My life

55:00.005 --> 55:01.839
- I want to party
- Party

55:01.923 --> 55:04.008
And fly

55:47.594 --> 55:49.428
You two are coming with me.

55:49.512 --> 55:51.680
In your little monkey dreams.

55:52.849 --> 55:54.475
Yeah.

55:55.685 --> 55:57.061
That was meant for you.

55:57.854 --> 56:00.606
Come on. Can we all just get along?

56:00.690 --> 56:03.776
This isn't your fight, big-nose.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.862
You mess with my friends,
you mess with me!

56:06.946 --> 56:08.238
And us!

56:08.323 --> 56:10.866
Yeah, little King Kong.

56:19.042 --> 56:20.709
I don't know what's going on here.

56:20.794 --> 56:22.753
Birds versus monkeys!

56:22.837 --> 56:23.879
Get them!

56:29.344 --> 56:31.678
Yippee-kai-yay, monkey man!

56:41.606 --> 56:43.107
Yee-haw! Giddy-up!

56:48.071 --> 56:49.196
Missed!

56:53.535 --> 56:54.743
We got to go!

56:56.413 --> 56:58.080
Need a lift?

57:10.510 --> 57:13.303
Take that, you funky monkey!

57:18.643 --> 57:20.769
- Thank you!
- Anytime!

57:20.854 --> 57:22.062
That's what I'm talking about!

57:22.147 --> 57:23.647
Man, we threw down!

57:23.731 --> 57:24.731
Yeah, we threw down.

57:24.816 --> 57:26.775
You guys were like fire and ice.

57:26.860 --> 57:28.485
- Thunder and lightning!
- Hip and hop!

57:28.570 --> 57:30.696
Cheese and sprinkles!

57:31.531 --> 57:33.198
It's a Minnesota thing.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.785
You see?
Nothing you say makes any sense.

57:41.040 --> 57:42.416
Come on, follow me.

57:49.090 --> 57:50.299
What?

57:51.926 --> 57:54.261
But the birds were here.

57:54.429 --> 57:55.679
Yeah, sure they were, kid.

57:55.763 --> 57:57.848
I swear, the birds were right here.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.350
- Well, how do you know?
- Because

58:00.852 --> 58:03.145
I'm... I'm the one who took them.

58:03.313 --> 58:04.354
You!

58:04.522 --> 58:08.025
I didn't want to hurt anybody,
I needed the money.

58:08.109 --> 58:10.277
But Fernando, I trusted you!

58:10.361 --> 58:11.612
I know, but...

58:13.490 --> 58:15.282
Man, that's good.

58:16.075 --> 58:17.409
Hey, guys.

58:17.577 --> 58:18.911
What are you doing here?

58:19.078 --> 58:22.372
I just wanted to see
if you had any work for me.

58:22.540 --> 58:26.001
Well, if you were here two hours ago,
you could've helped us load the...

58:26.544 --> 58:28.337
- What?
- Shut up.

58:29.172 --> 58:31.798
So, why are you guys dressed for Carnaval?

58:31.966 --> 58:34.843
So no one will notice us
when we smuggle these...

58:34.928 --> 58:36.595
Shut up!

58:38.598 --> 58:40.057
We made a float.

58:40.767 --> 58:42.184
A float!

58:42.352 --> 58:44.603
So you guys are going to the parade.
Can I come?

58:44.771 --> 58:46.438
I'm a great dancer.

58:46.606 --> 58:49.816
Can he come? Come on, please.
Three is better than two.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.903
Fine. We got to hurry though.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.113
I almost forgot.

58:55.573 --> 58:58.408
Where did I put it?
I thought it was right here.

59:00.453 --> 59:01.453
There it is.

59:01.913 --> 59:02.955
Got it.

59:03.373 --> 59:04.748
Let's go.

59:05.333 --> 59:06.542
Hurry up, kid.

59:06.709 --> 59:08.418
Can he ride on the plane with us, too?

59:09.045 --> 59:09.836
Shut up!

59:10.296 --> 59:12.798
No. We can't let them get on that plane.

59:15.218 --> 59:18.303
You can drive a motorcycle, right?

59:19.013 --> 59:20.597
You insult me.

59:29.857 --> 59:32.401
No, I can't drive a motorcycle.

59:44.122 --> 59:47.040
It's just like riding a snowmobile.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.977
What happened?

01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:08.103
Papa?

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:10.022
What happened?

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.652
Oh, no! Let me go.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:17.446
Stop your chirping and talk to me!

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.740
No, no. I don't know anything. Help!

01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:24.661
When I bite down on your head,
will it go "pop," or will it go "crack"?

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.373
Where are the cerulean birds?

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:30.167
That means blue, by the way.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.628
They escaped. Went to Luiz.

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:34.129
Anything else?

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:36.173
They said you were very nice.

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.758
Did they?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:39.718
Liar.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.762
And handsome, too.

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:47.142
Never send a monkey to do a bird's job.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.750
Don't worry. I got it.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.133
There he goes. That's my boy.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.847
Is it hot? I think I'm sweating.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:28.975
I didn't even think that
was biologically possible, and yet, look.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.060
Wow.

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:31.937
Yeah, that's your boy, all right.

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.855
Okay, so he needs a little help.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.357
Come on, let's give him some.

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:37.025
Set the mood.

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:42.322
All right, look, I'm on it.
I know how to set the mood. Check it out.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:43.907
Get a, Get a, Get a
Get a girl

01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:45.409
Get, Get, Get
Get a girl

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:48.662
Take her, take her to the floor
Show her, show her how you roll

01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:51.832
Drop it, drop it, drop it low
Drop it low, drop-drop it low

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.417
What kind of mood is that?

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.085
Pedro, Pedro, a little too aggressive.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:58.213
I'm not hating on your creativity,
but I think I got this one.

01:01:58.297 --> 01:01:59.506
Follow my lead.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:09.141
Now, that's more like it.

01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:19.025
Wasn't really thinking
Wasn't looking

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:22.738
Wasn't searching for an answer

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:27.242
In the moonlight

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:31.913
When I saw your face

01:02:32.665 --> 01:02:36.126
Wow! What a beautiful sunset.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.836
Yeah.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.297
Blu.

01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:44.050
Down here. Just tell her,
"You have beautiful eyes. "

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.844
That's good. Great idea.

01:02:46.804 --> 01:02:49.055
I have beautiful eyes.

01:02:50.391 --> 01:02:52.976
Yeah, okay. Sure, they're nice.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:56.146
No, her eyes. Her eyes.

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:59.399
Right, yeah. Your eyes,
your eyes are great, not mine.

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:00.650
I mean, mine are okay.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:03.820
But yours, I bet
you can see right through them.

01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:06.031
Blu!

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.201
Just tell her how you feel.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.287
- Jewel.
- Yeah.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.624
I've been wanting to tell you that I...

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:16.917
That I...

01:03:18.169 --> 01:03:20.796
How sweet. You're getting choked up.

01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:23.590
You're choking! Okay! All right!

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:29.638
Come on, Blu, move with me.
Stay with me, Blu.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:32.390
One more, come on. One more time!

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.811
Yep, that's my boy.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:53.703
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Luiz's garage.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.793
- After you.
- No, no, you first.

01:03:59.877 --> 01:04:01.002
Please, I insist.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.587
Okay.

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.717
Guess this is it.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.220
Yeah. Quite an adventure.

01:04:10.304 --> 01:04:11.680
End of the line.

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:12.764
Yes.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.267
Guess things like this
don't happen in Tiny-soda.

01:04:15.434 --> 01:04:16.726
Tiny-soda?

01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:19.229
- Wait, Minnesota.
- Yeah.

01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:21.773
That's very good.
That's very funny actually.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:25.068
Luiz! Are you here, Luiz? Hey, buddy!

01:04:25.444 --> 01:04:27.904
I got some friends I want you to meet.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.117
Go!

01:04:32.493 --> 01:04:35.036
Inside, outside, inside, outside!

01:04:42.628 --> 01:04:45.171
I got you's good.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.840
What?

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:50.343
I could've ripped your throats out,
but I didn't.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.430
But I could've.

01:04:53.514 --> 01:04:56.766
Hey, Luiz! Stop scaring my friends.

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:59.311
Hey, Rafi, come here!

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.187
Where you've been?

01:05:01.355 --> 01:05:02.731
You look good.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:05.942
Wait. Luiz is a bulldog?

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.944
You got something against dogs?

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.863
I do when they're drooling on me.

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.241
It's a medical condition.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:15.076
No, hey, amigo, we really need you.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.621
- She's mean, bro.
- Luiz, come on, please, please.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.206
We need your help.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.045
I think I know what to do.

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:34.971
Are you sure this is safe?

01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:37.390
Sure. There's nothing to it.

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:40.852
Now, if something goes wrong,
scream really loud!

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:43.688
Because I can't hear too good
with this thing on.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.191
Hey, Rafi! Get the switch, please.

01:05:46.692 --> 01:05:49.194
Don't worry. He's a professional.

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.534
Now, try not to move!

01:05:56.702 --> 01:06:00.246
I can't really see out of this thing, either!

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.354
Hey! Where did you go?

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.581
Gross.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.875
But I'm free.

01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:47.877
Jewel! Jewel! We're free!

01:06:48.045 --> 01:06:49.462
Slimy, but free.

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.715
Contaminated probably, but free.

01:06:51.882 --> 01:06:53.633
Can you believe it's finally...

01:06:55.928 --> 01:06:57.220
...over.

01:06:58.472 --> 01:06:59.639
Yeah!

01:07:01.225 --> 01:07:03.268
Come on, guys, let's go!

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:06.646
What are we standing around for?
It's Carnaval!

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:17.407
Oh, yeah!

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.869
Yep.

01:07:20.953 --> 01:07:23.079
I know just how you feel.

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:24.873
Watching them up there

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:28.251
makes you want to chase them
and grab them in your mouth

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:30.628
and bite their heads off, huh?

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.633
I'm just kidding, bro.

01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:38.011
Yeah, chasing them is plenty.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:52.192
I'm flying, flying just like a bird!

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.569
Jewel, but you are a bird!

01:07:58.699 --> 01:08:01.117
Hey! Where you going?

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:03.995
Blu?

01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:08.208
Blu, what's wrong?

01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:11.086
Nothing. Everything is perfect.

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:14.631
You'll be off to the rainforest, I'll be
back with Linda, just like we planned.

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:18.218
Hey, birds!
Stop yapping and start flapping!

01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:19.469
Let's go!

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.263
I guess, I thought, maybe...

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:24.224
What? That you'd come to Minnesota?

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:26.225
Great, I guess I'll knit you a scarf.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.645
No, that's not what I meant.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.814
Look, Jewel,
I can't spend my life

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:33.233
walking around following you
wherever you're going.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:35.944
Hey, it's not my
fault you can't fly.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:39.572
Awkward.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:40.823
Okay, okay.

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:44.077
You know what? This is good.
Just clear the air.

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.037
Just be completely honest
with each other.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.872
You want honesty?
Fine, I can be honest.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.082
I don't belong here.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.919
In fact, I never wanted to come here
in the first place.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.046
And... And...

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:56.923
And you know what?

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:58.424
I hate samba.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.470
Hey! That's a little too far.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:05.390
Make the mean bird take it back.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:07.015
Yeah, I said it.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.352
Every song sounds exactly the same.

01:09:09.435 --> 01:09:12.479
Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya
Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:15.316
I'm tico, taco out of here.

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:18.153
Fine! See you around, pet!

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.696
No, wait, wait. Come back!

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:23.867
You belong together!
You are Juliet to his Romeo!

01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:27.871
Sure, they both die in the end,
but you get my point!

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.374
Young love. Always so melodramatic.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.877
All right, boys, go after her.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:39.048
Blu! Come back here. Come on!

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.509
Yeah! I'm ready for Carnaval!

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:43.678
Who wants to ride in my

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:45.470
fruit.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:47.890
You left without me.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.725
That's messed up.

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:57.483
Jewels! Jewels!

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:59.444
Wait up!

01:10:04.408 --> 01:10:06.743
Going somewhere, pretty bird?

01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:10.163
Yeah. I was just on my way
to claw your eyes out!

01:10:10.247 --> 01:10:11.456
Jewel!

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.918
Temper, temper.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.419
Now come along, my dear.

01:10:16.503 --> 01:10:18.504
We're going to a parade.

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:21.925
Everybody loves a parade.

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:24.552
Let go of me!

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.888
Hey! Get back here!

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:30.975
Ain't nobody messing with a friend
of Pedro, I ain't having it!

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.185
It's on!

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:34.979
Did you see the talons on that guy?

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.064
Talons?

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:38.399
Maybe it's on next time.

01:10:39.693 --> 01:10:41.361
- Help!
- Help! Little help!

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:49.035
Rafael, quit following me.

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:52.538
You're going in the wrong direction.
Isn't Carnaval that way?

01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:54.207
I'm not going to Carnaval.

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:55.750
No, I'm going home.

01:10:55.834 --> 01:10:57.168
But I thought you loved Carnaval.

01:10:57.544 --> 01:11:00.630
I do. But I love my family much more.

01:11:00.714 --> 01:11:03.591
And that's a choice I made with this.

01:11:03.968 --> 01:11:05.635
Not with this.

01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:07.220
- Blu!
- Hey, Blu! Blu!

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:09.514
I was flying
and then I saw this big cockatoo!

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:10.848
With big ninja talons!

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.976
This cockatoo was ugly!
Anyway, that's not the point.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.395
And then Jewel was there,
and he snatched Jewel up.

01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:16.896
Like, he snatched her up.
And then he was like,

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:18.648
"You're coming with me,
you little princess. "

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:20.358
And Jewel was like,

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.818
"I ain't your princess, leave me alone. "

01:11:21.902 --> 01:11:23.486
- And I was like, "What?"
- Then he was like, "What?"

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:25.071
Stop! Just tell me what happened.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:26.447
He got Jewel, man!

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:27.991
And he's taking her to the parade.

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:31.202
This is all my fault.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:33.579
Let's fly.

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:38.626
Carnaval, here we come!

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.796
Hey, dog, I'm drowning back here!

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.716
You will get wet on this ride!

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.722
Come on, come on, come on.

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:53.057
Where are these guys?

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.858
Yes. Nice.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:03.985
Very nice.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:08.031
Marcel!

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:11.326
Oh, boy.

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:13.870
We're a chicken!

01:12:15.414 --> 01:12:17.290
Come on, Fernando! Dance!

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:21.252
Idiots.

01:12:23.964 --> 01:12:25.089
Excuse me.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.842
Coming through!

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.135
Watch your feet.

01:12:29.219 --> 01:12:30.678
Whoops! Sorry.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.514
Go ahead. Come in.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.350
Wait. Stop, please.

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:37.894
Performers only.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:53.576
Wow.

01:12:54.119 --> 01:12:56.287
Cyanopsitta spixii.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:07.256
Tulio?

01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:10.343
Linda. I was just...

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:22.688
I look ridiculous, don't I?

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.288
Sorry.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.125
The parade. It's about to start.

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:43.251
Okay.

01:13:43.877 --> 01:13:45.128
Go ahead.

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.338
Okay, just follow my lead.

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.590
Act naturally.

01:14:04.898 --> 01:14:05.982
Are you okay?

01:14:06.066 --> 01:14:07.066
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:08.776
- Blu?
- Blu!

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.779
Blu! Blu!

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.616
What? Wait, wait! No, no.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.953
I am looking for a bluebird. Birdo?

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:20.705
Birdo! Yes!

01:14:21.331 --> 01:14:22.665
Okay.

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.292
Wait! What are you doing?

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.585
Tulio!

01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:27.837
Hey! Let me out!

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:41.017
Tulio!

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:45.271
This is not good. This is not good. This is...

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:50.526
Cheese and sprinkles.

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:57.617
Okay, you can bring me down now!

01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:59.577
I think we're done here!

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.296
I think they like my moves.

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:12.924
Hey. Keep dancing, egg-boy.

01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:20.389
One down and one to go.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.058
You'll never find him.

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.101
He's already gone.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.853
I don't need to find him.

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.147
He'll find you.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.196
This is the spit!

01:15:36.823 --> 01:15:38.032
Yeah, baby!

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.284
Now, I could get my freak on!

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:41.869
Luiz, please!

01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:43.746
Rescue first. Freak later.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.542
- Come on!
- Out of my way, people!

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:52.255
All right, guys!

01:15:52.422 --> 01:15:54.215
I'll fly ahead and look for Jewel.

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:57.593
Hello, ladies.

01:15:59.304 --> 01:16:01.556
Mr. Big-nose! Hold up!

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.228
What?

01:16:08.772 --> 01:16:10.439
Linda? Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:14.777
Linda!

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:20.199
In English!

01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:23.536
Linda! Linda!
You've got to shake your tushy!

01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:26.831
No! We don't shake our tushies
in Minnesota!

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.836
Hot dog! Coming through!

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:35.673
Blu!

01:16:37.342 --> 01:16:40.261
Tulio! Tulio! I saw Blu!

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.013
What?

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:46.309
Hold on, Blu! I'm coming for you!

01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:00.406
Blu!

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:01.824
Linda!

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.200
Linda?

01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:04.368
Wait!

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.584
Blu, we found them!

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:13.586
She's on some weird chicken float!

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:14.920
Come on!

01:17:17.507 --> 01:17:18.549
Let's go get Jewel.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:21.135
Wait, Blu! Where are you going?

01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:27.391
Okay.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:39.445
I saw Blu! He's riding on a bulldog!

01:17:39.529 --> 01:17:40.529
What?

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.492
There they are! That's the float!

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:48.788
That float is a crime in itself!

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:04.178
There he is!

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:20.194
- Hey, Jewel.
- Blu!

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.654
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No.

01:18:21.738 --> 01:18:24.615
No, Blu, you can't be here.
You have to go. Nigel...

01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:27.952
Hello, pretty bird.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.622
So kind of you to join our little soirée.

01:18:31.748 --> 01:18:33.332
Come on. You really think I came alone?

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:35.501
I got three of the roughest, meanest

01:18:35.627 --> 01:18:38.129
craziest birds in all of Rio
right behind me.

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:41.424
You heard that, guys? We're saved!

01:18:41.633 --> 01:18:44.427
- That's right. That's right.
- I think he means us.

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:50.725
Love. It's such a powerful and stupid thing.

01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:01.152
Yes. Well done, Nigel.

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:07.199
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:19:07.367 --> 01:19:08.367
Out of the way.

01:19:09.202 --> 01:19:11.537
Sorry. Wait! Wait!

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:15.207
We actually made it! Hey, Marcel!

01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:17.668
Can we do this again next year?
Please? Please?

01:19:17.794 --> 01:19:19.462
Could I drive next year, too?

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.506
Wait! Come back!

01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:29.889
Get in!

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:37.563
I don't know how I got up here,
but I ain't never coming down!

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:48.741
Come on, kid.

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:00.961
I'm gonna get you guys out of here.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:02.713
- What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.257
You shouldn't have done that.
Come on.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.726
Just forget him!

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:17.144
Get the birds!

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:22.358
They're getting away.

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.111
We'll see about that.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:31.325
Watch out!

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.040
We did it, boys.

01:20:38.124 --> 01:20:40.334
- Yes! We did it.
- We're the best!

01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:42.503
Is that a float?

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.631
Wow! Look at the detail on that thing.

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:47.424
Pull up you, idiot! Pull up!

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:03.566
Blu! Blu!

01:21:05.068 --> 01:21:06.360
Oh, Blu.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:27.631
Sorry, Eva,
I'm not gonna be home for dinner.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:36.390
What are you doing?

01:21:36.474 --> 01:21:39.393
I'm gonna pop this cage open
like a soda can.

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:49.320
Now, that's popping!

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:51.697
Hurry. We got to help the others.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:54.992
I'm a pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.
Who's a pretty bird? I'm a pretty bird.

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.911
Pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.038
Come on!

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:03.792
I'm out!

01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:20.225
The light!

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.901
Go! Go! Go!

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.444
Freedom!

01:22:30.862 --> 01:22:32.279
Geronimo!

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.535
Come on! Come on!
We need to get out!

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.371
Wait, wait, wait!

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:47.753
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:51.006
We'll figure this out together. Right?

01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:55.636
Let him go!

01:22:59.349 --> 01:23:00.015
Jewel!

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.600
My wing.

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:03.519
Pity.

01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:06.772
Now we have two useless,
flightless birds.

01:23:13.863 --> 01:23:15.781
Not cool, man. Not cool!

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:29.336
We're going down!

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.464
- Okay, okay.
- Rock, paper, scissors...

01:23:32.632 --> 01:23:33.757
Chute!

01:23:34.467 --> 01:23:36.593
Hasta la vista, losers!

01:23:37.595 --> 01:23:38.595
Hey! Wait for us!

01:23:39.764 --> 01:23:41.223
Cannonball!

01:23:44.936 --> 01:23:46.145
Blu!

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.438
No!

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:06.123
Blu, you're crazy! What are you doing?

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:07.750
I'm not gonna let you go!

01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:10.794
We're chained-to-each-other birds,
remember?

01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:31.940
Wow.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.943
Blu! You're flying!

01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:36.153
Yeah!

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.156
I'm flying! I'm really flying.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.118
You're right, I'm not an ostrich.
I'm not an ostrich!

01:24:48.124 --> 01:24:49.249
What?

01:24:58.051 --> 01:24:59.134
Dad! Look!

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.100
Idiots.

01:25:12.315 --> 01:25:13.565
Linda!

01:25:16.319 --> 01:25:17.778
Blu?

01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:20.572
It's Blu! Look, Tulio, it's Blu!

01:25:20.657 --> 01:25:22.116
And he's flying.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:24.076
My Blu is flying!

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:24.993
He's flying.

01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:43.887
Here, let me see.

01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:48.934
Don't worry.

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:50.894
I'll take care of you.

01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:34.187
That's my big, brave boy.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:41.361
All the birds of a feather

01:26:42.488 --> 01:26:44.948
Do what we love most of all

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:49.161
Moon and the stars
Strumming guitars

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:53.582
That's why we love Carnaval

01:26:57.962 --> 01:27:01.506
Loving our life in the jungle

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:04.843
Everything's wild and free

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:08.430
Never alone
'Cause this is our home

01:27:08.514 --> 01:27:11.600
Magic can happen for real

01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:13.435
In Rio

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:15.646
All by itself

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:16.855
By itself

01:27:16.981 --> 01:27:20.275
You can't see it coming

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.277
You can't find it anywhere else

01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:24.112
I'm the capoeira king-a

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:25.197
King-a, king-a, king-a

01:27:25.281 --> 01:27:25.822
King-a!

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.574
Birds like me 'cause I'm a hot wing-a

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:29.326
Pedro, hot-a-wing-a

01:27:29.452 --> 01:27:31.745
Here everybody loves samba

01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:32.871
I like the samba

01:27:32.956 --> 01:27:34.915
Rhythm you feel in your heart

01:27:34.999 --> 01:27:36.333
I'm the samba master

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:39.503
Beauty and love
What more could you want?

01:27:39.879 --> 01:27:42.965
Fantasy can be for real

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:44.841
In Rio

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:46.885
Here's something else

01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:48.178
Something else

01:27:48.304 --> 01:27:51.640
You just feel it happening

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:55.102
You won't find it anywhere else

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:57.938
I love you, Rio!
