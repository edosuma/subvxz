03:27.999 --> 03:29.672
Hey, sweetie. Hey, Dad.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.217
I hit the Internet cafe.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.394
You know how many e-mails
I had in my box?

03:39.469 --> 03:40.891
Eighty-three.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.564
Oh, you're a popular guy.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.811
Very.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.235
Of course, 60 of 'em were ads
trying to get me to buy something.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.983
Sarah, did you leave
these tools on the ground?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.321
I might have.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.737
Let's get them in the bag and
bring them in the house, please.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.989
We don't want it
to rain on them.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.494
Oh, I checked
your Facebook page.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.576
What's-his-name
wrote on your wall again.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.832
God, I should
never have added you.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.249
Yeah, he, um.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.256
Wants to get back together.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.927
Of course he does.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.926
I told you. Princess,
he doesn't deserve you.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.691
There you are.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.188
And there you are. Here I am.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.610
Mmm-hmm.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.687
Hey, we have a problem.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.361
I've barely been gone
an hour. What now?

04:33.482 --> 04:34.608
You'll see.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.534
Great. Do I have to? Yeah.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.369
Hey, I was looking for you.
Did you go into town?

04:41.490 --> 04:42.958
Mmm-mmm. I didn't think so.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.535
Where were you? Outside.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.457
Working very
hard on the garden.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.958
Hmm. We have a garden?

04:48.038 --> 04:49.756
I had a headache.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.716
Haven't you heard that one before?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.176
I did!

04:53.251 --> 04:54.548
I know, honey.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.966
Are you all better now?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.719
Yes. Thank you, Uncle Peter.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.136
So, what is the big problem?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.389
All right, all right. This way.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.097
Why can't you just
tell me about it?

05:05.180 --> 05:07.399
No, this is something
you have to see.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.700
I'll give you a hint.
It's in here.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.571
Funny.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.700
What do you think?

05:27.077 --> 05:29.330
How are you supposed to
tell anything from that?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.914
What, do you need
binoculars, old man?

05:31.039 --> 05:32.791
Just get your face up there.
Look in there.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.419
Okay. Oh.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.005
That's really...
ls this necessary?

05:39.256 --> 05:40.929
I made a hole! What are you...

05:42.259 --> 05:45.183
Are you impressed with your dad?
I'm impressed with your dad.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.185
Now that, little
brother, is a hole.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.732
Nicely done.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.528
That is not good.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.196
No, not good.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.865
What is it? Oh, it's mold.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.864
Honey, you know what, I want you to stand back.
This is really bad.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.696
I don't want you breathing it in.
It can make you really sick.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.202
Just looking at it
is making me sick.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.705
This whole house could be
infected, for all we know.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.786
Affected, not infected.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.379
Affected, infected, whatever.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.128
Well, if you cover it up,
who'll ever know, right?

06:14.207 --> 06:18.212
That's true. Just a minute ago
we had a tiny hole to deal with.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.888
Now we have a big hole.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.965
Well, the insurance
will cover it.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.301
It's obviously
part of the leak.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.887
Did you remember
to bring the...

06:26.970 --> 06:29.223
Ah, great minds think alike.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.062
So what do you want to do?

06:36.146 --> 06:39.400
Why are you asking me?
We're out of here in a few days.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.076
Oh, okay. See here, this
is where it gets tricky.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.664
You're gonna dump
this whole thing on me.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.583
But it comes with the perk
of you not being here.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.251
So, dare I complain?

06:50.327 --> 06:51.795
It's what you do best.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.087
All right, I'll deal with it.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.586
Just don't give me shit later
when you find out how.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.088
Well, if you do it right the
first time, I won't have to.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.091
Have you checked the wall all
the way down to the basement?

07:00.170 --> 07:02.172
I just figured out
that it got down here.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.844
Okay, come on.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.593
Bring the work light, please.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.516
Have fun.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.407
Uncle Peter, don't do that!

07:20.523 --> 07:23.402
Come on. You used to love that
when you were a little girl.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.028
Any day now!

07:27.072 --> 07:28.574
Coming!

07:35.038 --> 07:36.756
How are you, Sarah?

07:37.874 --> 07:39.296
I'm okay. Yeah?

07:39.376 --> 07:42.550
Yeah. How are you?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.344
Look at you.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.009
I can't get over
how grown up you are.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.936
You gonna
come down here or what?

07:50.053 --> 07:52.272
Bite me! See you later.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.386
Sarah? Yeah.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.887
Wow, I can't believe
you're here!

08:33.096 --> 08:35.269
You don't remember me, do you?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.481
I'm so embarrassed.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.979
I'm Sophia.
We used to play together.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.279
Oh, of course. Yeah.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.945
How are you?

08:48.069 --> 08:51.289
I'm quite good actually, especially
now that I'm finding you here.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.660
Why is it so dark in here?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.287
The power's out.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.211
My dad thinks rats
chewed through the wires.

09:00.290 --> 09:05.467
I'd invite you in, but there's
really no place to hang or anything.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.136
That's okay.
I can't stay long anyways.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.260
It's beautiful, isn't it?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.057
How long's it been
since you were out here?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.938
A long time, years.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.940
Yeah. I come by
once in a while,

09:21.019 --> 09:22.521
and I've seen other people here

09:22.645 --> 09:24.022
but never you.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.991
Yeah, other family
come out now and then,

09:27.108 --> 09:29.577
but no one's really been
here this last summer.

09:29.652 --> 09:34.749
Well, except for the people who keep
breaking in and messing the place up.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.952
That's terrible. Yeah.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.787
Well, they broke
almost all our windows.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.999
My uncle had to call the
police to run them off.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.177
So what are you doing here now?

09:47.003 --> 09:49.176
Fixing it up.
We're gonna sell it.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.844
That's too bad.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.011
And aside from selling this
house, what are you up to?

09:57.055 --> 09:58.102
Nothing much.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.104
Are you in school or something?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.902
No, me and school
don't really go together.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.365
I'm working for my dad and thinking
about doing something else.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.740
Yeah, it's tough getting any
kind of job these days.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.991
There's so many things
I want to do,

10:16.074 --> 10:19.078
but I never seem to be
able to do any of them.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.208
Can you believe
how long it's been?

10:25.667 --> 10:30.389
Remember when we used to play
dress up and do makeovers?

10:30.505 --> 10:32.257
Did we? Yeah.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.134
Oh, my God.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.185
It's been so long,
I swear, sometimes,

10:36.261 --> 10:37.934
I think I have holes up here.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.443
I have a pile of photos around somewhere.
I'll have to find them.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.903
Yeah.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.991
You always had the best hair.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.664
So how long are you around for?

10:56.739 --> 10:58.707
We've already been
here a couple days,

10:58.783 --> 11:00.581
and my dad thinks
we're gonna head out soon.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.458
Really?

11:02.579 --> 11:05.082
Well, you maybe
want to hang out later?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.009
Yeah, that could be good.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.010
The phone lines
aren't set up though

11:13.089 --> 11:15.262
and our cells
don't work up here.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.265
It's okay,
I'll just come by later.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.851
Okay.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.772
I didn't know if I'd
ever see you again.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.279
It's so good to see you.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.106
Yeah, it's good
to see you, too.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.363
I'll see you later.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.037
You know, I do remember you.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.794
How could you forget?

11:46.623 --> 11:48.341
See you later.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.532
John, if you care so
much about the way it's done,

13:43.614 --> 13:46.242
you can do it yourself, okay?
Just do it yourself.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.079
Just trying to be helpful.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.880
You're an asshole.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.466
What? What did I do now? Sorry.
I gotta get out of here, Sarah.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.170
Whoops.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.426
Can I have the keys
to my car, please?

14:00.590 --> 14:01.807
Uh...

14:01.924 --> 14:03.392
You know where they are.
Give me the keys.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.890
When you're done with
your temper tantrums,

14:04.969 --> 14:06.562
see if you can get the electrician
on the phone, please.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.310
That would be awesome.
If he could come out here,

14:08.431 --> 14:09.808
we could use his
needle nose pliers

14:09.891 --> 14:11.734
to get that stick
out of your ass.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.484
What was that?
I love you, brother.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.622
I don't know why my brother always
has to make everything so difficult.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.868
Yeah, when he doesn't do
what you want him to.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.954
Exactly. You see, if everyone
would just do what I say,

14:31.037 --> 14:33.506
we wouldn't have any
problems, would we?

14:33.623 --> 14:35.296
Uh-huh.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.753
Do you need any
help down there?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.178
No, it's okay.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.138
Okay.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.454
Hey. What are you doing?

16:29.238 --> 16:31.582
I just thought
I heard something upstairs.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.409
It's probably the damn rats.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.086
God, don't remind me.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.749
No, it sounded like
someone was up there.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.009
Maybe it's your uncle.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.586
No, his car's not here.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.798
I know how you think, sweetie.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.597
Would you like me to go
upstairs and have a look?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.769
Yeah. Okay.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.788
Wait! I'm gonna come with you.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.198
Jesus!

17:49.318 --> 17:50.661
<i>L</i> get you?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.033
Yeah, you did and that hurt.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.827
I'm sorry.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.246
What, you're trying
to be funny?

18:00.329 --> 18:01.501
A little bit.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.650
What's that?

18:29.734 --> 18:32.078
Uh, it's just...

18:32.194 --> 18:36.199
It's just nothing.
It's photographs for the insurance.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.624
I don't know why your uncle just
leaves things laying around like this.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.330
Ridiculous.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.563
Sorry.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.904
Honey, you're gonna really have to start
making some progress in this room.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.620
You haven't even started
on this closet.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.288
Most of it isn't mine.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.287
So what?
It's just gonna stay here?

19:26.207 --> 19:27.925
What are you doing in here?

19:34.048 --> 19:36.597
I don't know if you got the fact that
we're packing it up to get out...

19:36.717 --> 19:38.310
Yes, I do understand that.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.263
That box is completely empty.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.819
If your cousins
don't wanna help out,

19:50.940 --> 19:53.409
just keep what you want.
Throw everything else out.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.282
Okay.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.453
At least that's empty.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.531
Right, but what
about the noise?

19:58.614 --> 20:02.710
Honey, it's an old house.
They make noises.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.628
I'm sure it's nothing.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.590
But I'll keep
looking around, okay?

20:07.665 --> 20:09.008
Thank you.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.428
I want you to sit down,
go through that stuff,

20:12.503 --> 20:14.050
and start throwing things away.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.599
I want to come back here
and see full garbage bags.

20:16.674 --> 20:17.675
All right. You hear me?

20:17.758 --> 20:18.930
Yes.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.979
All right. I'll be right back.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.497
Daddy?

21:31.874 --> 21:33.626
Yeah?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.757
What's going on?

21:35.878 --> 21:37.880
Nothing's going on.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.882
What's going on in there?
Are you packing?

21:40.007 --> 21:41.759
Yeah, I'm throwing stuff out.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.560
Good. That's what
I want to hear.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.920
Dad?

22:41.110 --> 22:42.578
Daddy?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.602
Dad?

23:20.816 --> 23:22.284
Daddy?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.505
Daddy?

24:58.747 --> 25:00.124
Come on, Dad.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.803
Oh, my God.
Daddy, what have they done to you'?

33:02.272 --> 33:03.899
Daddy.

33:08.278 --> 33:10.326
Daddy, wake up.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.082
Oh, my God.

33:16.244 --> 33:19.623
Wake up. Wake up!

33:26.671 --> 33:29.845
Oh, my God. You're alive.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.816
You're gonna be okay.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.940
You're gonna be okay.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.866
Oh, my God.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.014
Okay, the key. Where's the key?

34:36.157 --> 34:37.750
You're gonna be okay.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.672
I'm gonna come back.

34:53.341 --> 34:56.844
Daddy, hang on.
Okay, I'm gonna go get help.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.350
Sarah, what are you
doing out here?

44:41.429 --> 44:42.646
Why aren't you
back at the house?

44:42.647 --> 44:44.891
Uncle Peter! Hey. Sarah.

44:44.974 --> 44:46.942
It's okay.
Hey, what's going on?

44:47.018 --> 44:48.486
Sarah, tell me what's going on.

44:48.561 --> 44:49.653
They got Daddy.

44:49.770 --> 44:52.114
Who's got...
You have blood all over you.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.988
What is going on, Sarah?
They fucking killed him!

44:54.108 --> 44:55.451
Sarah, who hurt your dad?

44:55.526 --> 44:57.699
Somebody was back
at the house? Who?

44:57.778 --> 44:59.872
There was just a girl.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.415
A girl? I don't see any girl.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.458
Sarah, you gotta tell me what's
going on so I can help you.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.536
What is going on?
Where is your dad?

45:05.620 --> 45:09.250
He's at...
He's in the room on the floor.

45:09.332 --> 45:10.879
Is he back at the house? Yeah.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.255
Okay.

45:12.335 --> 45:13.552
Hey, where are you going?

45:13.628 --> 45:14.720
To get your dad.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.388
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:16.464 --> 45:19.434
Uncle Peter,
we need to go get help!

45:19.508 --> 45:21.510
If your dad is hurt we need
to help him right now.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.684
We don't have any time
to go back into town, Sarah.

45:23.804 --> 45:24.771
No! Please!

45:24.847 --> 45:26.690
Tell me how many people
you saw back at the house.

45:26.807 --> 45:28.775
I don't know!
Just give me an idea. One, two, three?

45:28.851 --> 45:30.068
Tell me what I'm
dealing with here.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.316
There was one man...

45:31.395 --> 45:32.772
Back at the house?

45:32.855 --> 45:34.949
And then there was
just a girl by the road!

45:35.024 --> 45:36.617
Jesus, goddamn squatters!

45:36.692 --> 45:38.069
Please, stop!

45:38.152 --> 45:39.244
It's okay, Sarah.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.414
I'm not gonna
let anyone hurt you.

45:41.489 --> 45:42.866
I don't wanna be here!

45:42.949 --> 45:44.667
Sarah, come on, calm down.

45:47.912 --> 45:51.667
Here. Your wrist is bleeding.

45:52.708 --> 45:56.588
We'll tie this up first.
I got something here.

45:56.671 --> 45:58.469
I'm sorry.

45:58.547 --> 46:00.049
I'm sorry. I know that hurts.

46:00.174 --> 46:02.097
All right, just put pressure on that.
Hold on to it.

46:02.176 --> 46:04.554
Sarah, honey, it's gonna be okay.
All right'?

46:06.597 --> 46:07.849
Where are you going?

46:07.932 --> 46:10.230
I'm gonna get your dad.
Just stay in the car.

46:11.852 --> 46:12.944
What are you doing?

46:13.020 --> 46:14.192
I'm getting my gun.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.070
You can't leave me alone here!
I'm gonna be right back!

46:16.190 --> 46:18.067
Just stay in the car, Sarah! No!

46:18.192 --> 46:19.944
No!

46:20.027 --> 46:22.871
Stay in the car and
lock the doors. Lock it!

49:06.026 --> 49:07.994
Uncle Peter!

49:19.206 --> 49:20.753
Uncle Peter!

50:17.848 --> 50:19.395
Jesus, Sarah!

50:20.684 --> 50:22.686
What are you doing?
I told you to stay in the car!

50:22.770 --> 50:23.942
You left the trunk open!

50:24.021 --> 50:25.273
No, I didn't!
I closed the trunk.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.529
Someone got in the car!

50:29.360 --> 50:30.953
What?

50:37.743 --> 50:40.292
You can't open it.
I locked him out.

50:40.371 --> 50:41.623
No!

50:41.747 --> 50:43.215
Do you have my key?
Yeah, I'm not giving it...

50:43.290 --> 50:45.133
Give me the key, Sarah!
I'm not gonna give it to you!

50:45.251 --> 50:48.300
Please don't! I don't want to!

50:51.465 --> 50:53.888
I don't want to go out there.

51:06.480 --> 51:10.326
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about before.
I didn't know.

51:11.443 --> 51:13.992
You all right? You sure?

51:14.113 --> 51:15.490
Yeah.

51:19.827 --> 51:22.455
Can you show me exactly where
you last saw your father?

51:24.415 --> 51:27.259
I looked around
but I didn't see anybody.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.757
I looked quick. Take this.

51:32.172 --> 51:34.015
How's your wrist? It's okay.

51:35.134 --> 51:37.762
All right, we're
sticking together now.

51:37.845 --> 51:39.939
What if he gets in the basement?
Forget about it.

51:40.014 --> 51:41.687
We're gonna get your dad and
we're gonna get out of here.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.525
Get right behind me. Come on.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.196
Come on.

51:56.822 --> 51:58.290
John?

52:11.879 --> 52:13.301
John?

52:46.413 --> 52:47.835
John?

52:49.917 --> 52:52.215
He wasn't in that room.

53:00.427 --> 53:02.054
Where was he?

53:04.932 --> 53:06.775
He was in there.

53:13.607 --> 53:15.109
Okay.

53:16.610 --> 53:18.283
Let's look again.

53:48.809 --> 53:50.732
He was right here.

53:54.773 --> 53:56.616
Oh, Jesus.

54:06.118 --> 54:08.541
Sarah, how was your father
when you last left him?

54:08.620 --> 54:11.248
Could he have gotten up?
Could he have moved somewhere?

54:13.709 --> 54:15.803
I can't see how.

54:21.425 --> 54:23.803
Okay, well, maybe he...

54:25.429 --> 54:27.431
Maybe he came to.

55:12.893 --> 55:14.486
Uncle Peter?

55:17.898 --> 55:19.445
Over here.

55:42.548 --> 55:45.427
I don't think there's
anybody on this floor.

55:50.222 --> 55:52.270
Yeah.

56:05.654 --> 56:07.531
Oh, man.

56:07.614 --> 56:09.958
What? What is that?

56:10.033 --> 56:11.706
Uh, it's...

56:12.828 --> 56:15.377
It's garbage. Here.

56:17.249 --> 56:19.343
Gotta get this out of here.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.354
Did you check upstairs?

56:34.057 --> 56:35.684
Quickly. Let's...

56:36.643 --> 56:38.145
Let's look again.

56:58.540 --> 57:00.884
Wait! Stay close to me.

57:03.921 --> 57:05.423
Give me your hand.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.514
It's okay.

57:12.346 --> 57:14.098
It's okay.

57:54.846 --> 57:56.519
What?

57:58.058 --> 58:00.060
That wasn't on before.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.220
They took him.

59:56.927 --> 59:59.601
I'm sorry, Sarah,
we looked everywhere.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:09.819
Uncle Peter.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:13.031
Uncle Peter...

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.612
Uncle Peter!

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.645
That's good. That's right.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.399
Just like that.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.279
Good. It's okay.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:02.120
Yeah. It's just a little
game we're playing.

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:08.789
Nice.

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:12.046
Don't be shy.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:28.684
Hmm.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:35.274
That wasn't so bad.
Hmm? Was it?

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.449
How about a little snack now?

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.891
There you are.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.388
Sophia. What are you...

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:22.844
Thought we had a date,
didn't we?

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:35.314
Are you looking for this?

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.753
That's not the key
to this door.

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.372
That's not the way out.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.048
Daddy?

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.217
What did you do to him?

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.719
Not nearly enough.

01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:48.391
Daddy want his favorite drink?

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.691
No'? I think he's
going to need it.

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:54.565
Who are you?
Why are you doing this to us?

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.984
You have trouble
remembering, Sarah.

01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.907
You have holes up here.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.582
You have the key.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:38.836
Did I...

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:42.843
No.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:46.096
Finish what you started.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.219
No.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.061
Leave us alone!

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.433
Stop punishing yourself, Sarah.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.554
Sarah, ple...

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:33.762
You have to be quiet or
you're gonna wake up Mommy

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:36.230
and then I'll have
to punish you.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:47.908
So you want to
play with me now?

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.538
Why are you making
such a big deal?

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:54.365
It's just a game,
don't be such a baby.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:56.325
Don't... Don't...

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:02.916
Please don't! Please don't!

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:06.089
Ow, Daddy, it hurts.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.638
It hurts.

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:12.224
Daddy would never hurt you.

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:14.176
Liar!

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:18.977
Look. Look at what you did.
Look at what you did to me!

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.100
How could you!

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.483
Look at what you did.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:32.987
Sarah, honey,
you're seeing things,

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:35.994
people that aren't there.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:38.959
You're making things up
that didn't happen.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:43.794
But we can get
through this, baby.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:47.419
You're gonna have to
do what I say. Okay?

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:51.677
I can help you but you're
gonna have to untie me first.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:56.560
Sweetie...

01:15:58.471 --> 01:15:59.893
Honey?

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:05.687
It's okay. It's okay.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:08.985
Come on. That's right.

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:16.246
Just take it easy.
Just take it easy.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:19.083
Oh, God. Thank you.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.828
Now just give these to me.

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:24.671
All right. All right.

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:30.340
Okay.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.852
Honey, it's all right.

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:41.772
It's okay. It's okay.

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:44.684
All right. You okay?

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:05.455
No, Daddy! Ow!

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.214
You're making me
do this, Sarah.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.381
No!

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:14.801
John...

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:25.479
Just leave her alone.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.227
Leave her alone?

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:36.451
Shut up, Peter.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:40.199
Shut up and
enjoy the show, huh?

01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:42.625
Just like you always did.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.743
Right, Sarah? Let her go.

01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:48.331
What is this, a joke?

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:53.173
You're such a loser.

01:17:56.297 --> 01:18:00.427
Pretending to be dead.
And then you attack me?

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:11.312
This will be our
special little secret.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.160
Oh, God.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:25.038
Oh, God, Sarah. Please.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.707
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:30.874
It was so long ago.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:34.210
I should have stopped it,
I should have stopped him.
