00:01.632 --> 00:03.304
Help!

00:06.077 --> 00:08.309
(Grunts)

00:19.450 --> 00:22.793
(Muffled screams)

00:24.425 --> 00:26.126
(Joan) Megan!

00:26.127 --> 00:27.498
In here, mom.

00:28.659 --> 00:29.659
Oh.

00:29.660 --> 00:32.102
Hi.

00:32.103 --> 00:34.033
Your usual.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.106
Thank you.

00:36.107 --> 00:38.138
So...

00:38.139 --> 00:41.241
This is the room you want
to do what with exactly?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.243
Well, I'm no interior decorator,

00:43.244 --> 00:45.375
but I want to fix
it up for Lacey.

00:45.376 --> 00:48.248
Interior designer. That's what
the professionals call them.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.619
Okay. I want to make it nice

00:49.620 --> 00:51.321
because Lacey's gonna
stay here more often.

00:51.322 --> 00:52.522
Really?

00:52.523 --> 00:54.554
And you have all this
worked out with Todd?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.555
Mom.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.726
(Drops magazine)

00:56.727 --> 00:58.388
You're here to help
me pick out a color.

00:58.389 --> 01:00.460
What do you think of that?

01:00.461 --> 01:04.094
I think I should introduce
you to my interior designer.

01:04.095 --> 01:06.296
(Cell phone rings)

01:06.297 --> 01:07.797
(Ring)

01:07.798 --> 01:09.269
(Beeps)

01:09.270 --> 01:12.172
Dr. Hunt.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.104
(Police radio chatter)

01:14.105 --> 01:15.275
Morning, Dr. Hunt.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.446
Hey, Dani.

01:16.447 --> 01:17.607
Hey, I'm Dani.

01:17.608 --> 01:18.778
Oh, you two haven't...

01:18.779 --> 01:20.150
No, but I've seen you around.

01:20.151 --> 01:21.112
Yeah, you, too. Sure. I'm Peter.

01:21.113 --> 01:22.282
Nice to finally meet you.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.453
You, too.

01:23.454 --> 01:25.115
(Sam) Look at that.

01:25.116 --> 01:26.416
(Sighs)

01:26.417 --> 01:28.088
Hey, Dani.

01:30.261 --> 01:32.122
What's up with girls
using guys' names?

01:32.123 --> 01:33.624
I think it's very cool.

01:35.166 --> 01:38.268
(Indistinct conversations)

01:38.269 --> 01:40.100
Don't start, okay?

01:41.372 --> 01:44.234
(Morris) Some frat
idiots had an initiation

01:44.235 --> 01:46.136
on a bridge upstream.

01:46.137 --> 01:49.209
One of 'em used the
deceased as a lifeline.

01:49.210 --> 01:52.242
Divers pulled her
out ten minutes ago.

01:52.243 --> 01:54.284
Expensive lingerie.

01:54.285 --> 01:56.346
Manicured nails.

01:56.347 --> 02:00.220
Skin texture suggests
immersion for at least 2 days.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.352
I assume we have no I.D.
(Camera shutter clicking)

02:02.353 --> 02:04.354
Nope. And nothing
from missing persons.

02:04.355 --> 02:06.556
Superficial wounds,

02:06.557 --> 02:07.897
but...

02:07.898 --> 02:11.201
Nothing that appears fatal yet.

02:11.202 --> 02:12.562
Oh.

02:12.563 --> 02:15.905
That's a nice compound
fracture to the left humerus.

02:15.906 --> 02:17.307
Well, the divers
had a rough time

02:17.308 --> 02:18.308
pulling her up from the rocks.

02:18.309 --> 02:20.270
So someone bludgeoned her

02:20.271 --> 02:22.272
or it was the
river or the divers

02:22.273 --> 02:24.214
or a combination of all three.

02:24.215 --> 02:25.645
Peter.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.816
Yeah?

02:26.817 --> 02:28.178
Get water samples.

02:28.179 --> 02:29.149
Got it.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.781
See you in autopsy.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.928
You lookin' for guppies?

02:38.929 --> 02:40.230
(Chuckles)

02:40.231 --> 02:41.591
Diatoms.

02:41.592 --> 02:43.593
They're unicellular
algae that thrive in water.

02:43.594 --> 02:46.196
If she drowned, we should
be able to find it in her blood.

02:46.197 --> 02:48.438
I thought water in the
lungs determined drowning.

02:48.439 --> 02:50.270
Well, yeah, but
these are good, too.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.342
And, uh, since they live in
colonies along the river, then...

02:52.343 --> 02:54.944
They'll help you figure
out where she went in.

02:54.945 --> 02:56.346
You're a quick study.

02:56.347 --> 02:58.709
That's what they tell me.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.685
(Kate) I appreciate you
dropping me of at work.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.218
Ah, no. It's no problem.

03:08.219 --> 03:10.360
We'll make up for
it next weekend.

03:10.361 --> 03:12.922
I was thinking about
taking a trip somewhere.

03:12.923 --> 03:14.224
Where?

03:14.225 --> 03:15.865
Somewhere beyond
cell phone range.

03:15.866 --> 03:17.196
What about Lacey?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.828
Hey, now that we're
not moving to California,

03:18.829 --> 03:20.500
Megan's been angling to
spend more time with her.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.873
Means more time for us, too.

03:25.276 --> 03:27.537
Are you okay?

03:27.538 --> 03:29.939
Yeah. We'll talk about it later.

03:29.940 --> 03:32.642
(Opens door)

03:32.643 --> 03:34.345
(Closes door)

03:36.717 --> 03:38.448
Isn't this your day off?

03:38.449 --> 03:39.649
Yep.

03:39.650 --> 03:41.291
Do I want to know?

03:41.292 --> 03:42.253
(Kate) Nope.

03:42.254 --> 03:43.623
Dr. Murphy.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.725
You taking another
case away from me?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.226
Ah, hell.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.329
How about you just
accept the help, Megan?

03:49.330 --> 03:50.530
Why does that make me nervous?

03:50.531 --> 03:52.532
(Morris) If you ladies are
finished with the coffee klatch,

03:52.533 --> 03:54.264
can we get started, please?

03:54.265 --> 03:55.705
(Sam) Well, we ran her prints.

03:55.706 --> 03:57.307
Got a hit to an FBI database.

03:57.308 --> 03:59.238
Her name is Amy green.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.871
As in the old frenchamee.

04:01.872 --> 04:04.243
(Stammers) It means "beloved."

04:04.244 --> 04:06.476
(Chuckles) He's on
the hunt for baby names.

04:06.477 --> 04:08.318
Aw. That's sweet.

04:08.319 --> 04:10.450
Okay, can we focus, please?

04:10.451 --> 04:12.322
Is there any chance this
young woman just drowned?

04:12.323 --> 04:14.624
Ethan is pulling femoral
blood to find diatoms.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.356
We'll know soon enough.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.027
Why was this girl's name
in the FBI database?

04:18.028 --> 04:20.029
She was printed for her job.

04:20.030 --> 04:21.861
Um, she worked
for maven industries

04:21.862 --> 04:23.393
as a pharmaceutical rep.

04:23.394 --> 04:25.295
Oh, she was a pharm girl.

04:25.296 --> 04:27.797
I met quite a few of those
when I was neurosurgeon.

04:27.798 --> 04:29.569
Very ambitious.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.571
We, uh, have an address
for a corporate apartment,

04:31.572 --> 04:33.303
but we're still
looking for her family.

04:33.304 --> 04:35.405
Ugh. Okay, this is weird.

04:35.406 --> 04:37.647
I-I'm not getting any
blood from the femoral.

04:37.648 --> 04:39.379
Check the other one.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.351
There's some kind of fibrous
material under her nails.

04:41.352 --> 04:42.313
We'll need pictures, Ethan.

04:42.314 --> 04:44.514
Ethan... that's a great name.

04:44.515 --> 04:46.386
Forever spoiled,
thank you very much.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.987
(Megan) I have got
a compound fracture

04:47.988 --> 04:49.589
to the left humerus.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.291
I can't tell whether it's
ante or post mortem.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.993
(Kate) I'll put a rush on X-ray.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.666
Well, she's been in
the water for a while.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.828
Could be aquatic
animal activity.

04:58.829 --> 05:00.800
Could you be more specific?

05:00.801 --> 05:01.831
Fish bites.

05:01.832 --> 05:04.434
Ah...

05:04.435 --> 05:07.306
I-I can't find any
blood in her arteries.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.808
Could it have washed away?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.680
Even if she
transected an artery,

05:10.681 --> 05:12.311
there'd still be
some in her veins.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.344
Okay, but I'm telling you,

05:14.345 --> 05:17.487
there's no blood in
this woman's body.

05:17.488 --> 05:19.489
Maybe she's a vampire.

05:19.490 --> 05:22.522
Yeah, but see, vampires
have blood in their veins.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.824
Not if another vampire
sucks it out of them.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.656
You're perfect.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.658
What?

05:28.659 --> 05:30.329
Uh, either way, you know,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.532
vampires can't drown, so...

05:32.533 --> 05:34.033
What is this, a
"twilight" convention?

05:34.034 --> 05:35.505
Dani, don't you have
someplace to be?

05:35.506 --> 05:37.507
I was invited. By who?

05:37.508 --> 05:39.038
I just got this from the lab.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.039
Hey, Dani.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.541
What you got for me?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.344
A diatom from the river.

05:45.876 --> 05:48.678
Definitely not a guppy.

05:48.679 --> 05:50.450
(Chuckles) Hey,
my turn, my turn.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.351
Here we go. Here we
go. My turn. (Chuckles)

05:52.352 --> 05:55.354
I pulled this from
Amy's bone marrow.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.657
So she did drown.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.561
Yeah, but we have a problem.

06:01.692 --> 06:02.863
Yes, you do.

06:04.395 --> 06:05.496
They don't match.

06:08.439 --> 06:09.769
You're sure this is right?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.801
It's right. I
double-checked myself.

06:11.802 --> 06:14.143
Amy had diatoms
in her bone marrow.

06:14.144 --> 06:16.476
She drowned. But they didn't
come from the schuylkill river.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.479
So where'd they come from?

06:19.480 --> 06:22.413
We found her body here.

06:23.814 --> 06:26.456
She drowned here.

06:26.457 --> 06:28.689

I can't believe Amy's dead.

07:27.217 --> 07:29.919
So, Beth, you were
Amy's assistant,

07:29.920 --> 07:33.483
and, Molly, you worked for
Amy's biggest competitor?

07:33.484 --> 07:34.784

07:39.159 --> 07:41.230
When was the last time
either of you saw Amy?

07:41.231 --> 07:43.032
Two days ago.

07:43.033 --> 07:45.865
Here at the apartment.
She was going to the airport.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.097
She went to Denver
for a conference.

07:48.098 --> 07:51.170
After that, she was supposed
to visit her family in Iowa.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.973
We have reason to believe that
Amy was in Maine two days ago.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.746
Do you have any idea why
she might have been there?

07:56.747 --> 07:58.648
Well, Amy was seeing somebody,

07:58.649 --> 08:00.750
but I thought she
broke it off with him.

08:00.751 --> 08:01.981
Name?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.513
I don't know.

08:03.514 --> 08:04.914
It wasn't serious.

08:04.915 --> 08:06.786
Some guys are for marrying.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.688
Other guys are for...

08:08.689 --> 08:10.520
Himstim?

08:10.521 --> 08:14.194
(People speaking indistinctly)

08:16.867 --> 08:19.098
So Amy didn't drown.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.100
There's no middle
ear hemorrhaging

08:21.101 --> 08:22.602
or pulmonary edema.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.173
So how do you
explain the diatoms?

08:24.174 --> 08:27.106
We can't, any more than we
can explain the loss of blood.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.808
Anything from bud and Sam?

08:28.809 --> 08:30.109
Yeah, Amy was dating
some mystery guy.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.642
Did you find any
evidence that shows

08:32.643 --> 08:34.644
that she was seeing somebody
the night that she died?

08:34.645 --> 08:36.617
(Curtis) How about
her last meal? Ah.

08:37.748 --> 08:39.889
(Sniffs) Seafood.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.020
Rare belon oysters.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.992
You just happen to know that?

08:42.993 --> 08:45.054
I know food.

The lab I.D.'Ed
'em. Also I.D.'Ed...

08:46.857 --> 08:48.828
Diatoms. That's how
they got into her system.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.700
From eating oysters?

08:50.701 --> 08:52.001
Diatoms are oyster food,

08:52.002 --> 08:54.163
and Amy had ulcerations
in her stomach.

08:54.164 --> 08:55.665
Yeah, the ulcers
act like a freeway

08:55.666 --> 08:57.206
for the diatoms to
enter her blood stream.

08:57.207 --> 08:58.968
Okay, so where would somebody

08:58.969 --> 09:01.110
find rare belon
oysters in Philly?

09:01.111 --> 09:03.042
(People speaking indistinctly)

09:03.043 --> 09:05.114
What you lookin' at me for?

09:05.115 --> 09:06.716
(Scoffs)

09:06.717 --> 09:08.117
Okay.

09:08.118 --> 09:10.119
I know a place that
flies 'em in fresh.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.120
(Megan and Kate laugh)

09:11.121 --> 09:11.982
(Woman) American airlines

09:11.983 --> 09:14.183
flight 221 now boarding.

09:14.184 --> 09:16.726
These oysters come
packed in their own seawater.

09:16.727 --> 09:18.057
Try one?

09:18.058 --> 09:19.558
No. Flown in fresh, huh?

09:19.559 --> 09:20.730
Oh, yeah.

09:20.731 --> 09:22.031
My buddy in t.S.A hooks me up.

09:22.032 --> 09:23.562
Mmm. Mm.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.564
The only place in Philly
you can find 'em fresh.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.966
(Slurps) Mmm. Huh?

09:26.967 --> 09:27.967
Verdict?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.038
Oh, that's delicious.

09:29.039 --> 09:30.199
(Laughs)

09:30.200 --> 09:33.172
You recognize her?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.804
Yeah. That looks like sweetness.

09:34.805 --> 09:35.905
Sweetness?

09:35.906 --> 09:37.176
Chris gives us all nicknames.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.208
It's so cute.

09:39.209 --> 09:41.110
(Woman giggles)

09:41.111 --> 09:42.912
I'm sassy. And you must be...

09:42.913 --> 09:44.113
Giggles.

09:44.114 --> 09:46.155
What are you asking
about Amy for?

09:46.156 --> 09:48.187
You know Amy?

09:48.188 --> 09:49.288
(Sighs)

09:49.289 --> 09:51.160
Was Amy in two nights ago?

09:51.161 --> 09:53.793
(Sighs) Oh, it was
busy, so I can't really say.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.695
What's this about anyway?

09:55.696 --> 09:57.827
Amy's body was pulled from
the schuylkill this morning.

09:57.828 --> 10:00.269
Oh, my god. Did she drown?

10:00.270 --> 10:01.801
We're not sure how she died.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.132
(People speaking indistinctly)

10:03.133 --> 10:04.133
(Clicks tongue)

10:04.134 --> 10:06.876
Well, if you do
remember anything...

10:06.877 --> 10:08.607
You let us know, all right?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.109
Yeah.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.111
(Indistinct conversations)

10:12.112 --> 10:13.813
So two nights ago,

10:13.814 --> 10:15.815
they were supposed to
be on a flight to Denver,

10:15.816 --> 10:17.116
but Amy stayed behind,

10:17.117 --> 10:19.118
and they were under
the distinct impression

10:19.119 --> 10:22.092
that she blew off
the trip for a date.

10:24.054 --> 10:27.026
(Voice breaking) Amy
was a very determined girl.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.098
She had to do
everything her own way.

10:29.099 --> 10:30.900
How so, Mrs. Green?

10:30.901 --> 10:33.632
The job with maven?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.134
I was against her taking it.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.707
Why is that?

10:37.708 --> 10:39.138
Amy was so nice,

10:39.139 --> 10:41.140
always had the best intentions.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.674
And the pharmaceutical
business can be cutthroat?

10:44.675 --> 10:47.748
I was afraid the job
would change her.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.981
Amy had ulcers, Mrs. Green.

10:51.982 --> 10:54.083
Was... Anything bothering her?

10:54.084 --> 10:55.725
Was she unusually stressed?

10:55.726 --> 10:57.656
Not that I know of.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.128
Was she in a relationship?

10:59.129 --> 11:00.960
(Inhales deeply)

11:00.961 --> 11:03.693
She didn't talk about anyone.

11:03.694 --> 11:06.937
Her only concern was her job.

11:08.438 --> 11:11.170
I should've fought harder.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.172
I shouldn't have let her go.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.004
We're gonna find who did this.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.147
When can I bring her home?

11:18.909 --> 11:20.780
We still have to determine

11:20.781 --> 11:22.812
exactly how she died.

11:22.813 --> 11:24.853
But I promise, we'll let you
know as soon as we can.

11:27.157 --> 11:29.158
Here's the security
footage from two nights ago.

11:29.159 --> 11:31.921
You need anything, I'll be
in there with animal control.

11:31.922 --> 11:34.063
Someone brought a dozen
Jesus lizards from Costa Rica

11:34.064 --> 11:36.225
on board a 747 this morning.

11:36.226 --> 11:38.798
Well, thanks... sue.

11:38.799 --> 11:39.969
(Indistinct conversations)

11:39.970 --> 11:41.971
Parents Johnny cash fans?

11:41.972 --> 11:43.102
What do you think?

11:43.103 --> 11:46.275
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

11:46.276 --> 11:48.307
(Clicks tongue)

11:48.308 --> 11:50.940
He's sue. You're
Sam. She's Dani.

11:50.941 --> 11:52.341
What the hell is going on?

11:52.342 --> 11:54.143
Will you stop stressing
about baby names?

11:54.144 --> 11:56.185
It's the first decision
you make for your kid.

11:56.186 --> 11:57.246
It's a lot of pressure.

11:57.247 --> 11:59.218
Hold it. Check this out.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.950
That's Amy in the green suit.

12:00.951 --> 12:02.952
And that is not a
secret boyfriend.

12:02.953 --> 12:04.393
That is Amy's assistant Beth.

12:04.394 --> 12:06.095
She told us

12:06.096 --> 12:08.157
the last time she saw
Amy was at the apartment.

12:08.158 --> 12:10.801
She lied.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.336
Mom, dad's waiting in the car.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.968
I can't be late for school.

12:18.969 --> 12:21.140
Okay, okay. I just want to
show you this really quick.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.511
(Inhales sharply)

12:22.512 --> 12:24.443
It's just... it's a mess now,

12:24.444 --> 12:26.816
but I've got this
interior decorator...

12:26.817 --> 12:29.148
I mean, a designer helping me.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.220
I-I thought it was fine before.

12:31.221 --> 12:32.782
Yeah, for every other weekend.

12:32.783 --> 12:34.083
But since you're gonna be
spending more time here now,

12:34.084 --> 12:35.254
I want it to be nice.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.926
More time here?

12:36.927 --> 12:38.928
That's what you said, isn't it?

12:38.929 --> 12:41.430
That you want to stay in
Philadelphia to be with me.

12:41.431 --> 12:42.932
Yeah...

12:42.933 --> 12:45.294
And my friends and grandma.

12:45.295 --> 12:48.067
Yeah, of course, but...

12:48.068 --> 12:49.268
You want to...

12:49.269 --> 12:51.540
Spend more time here...

12:51.541 --> 12:52.943
Right?

12:54.244 --> 12:55.976
Sure.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.349
(Morris) Here you are.

13:00.350 --> 13:04.013
Is it just me, Beth, or
have you had a makeover?

13:04.014 --> 13:07.016
I've been promoted
to Amy's position.

13:07.017 --> 13:08.417
Have you now?

13:08.418 --> 13:11.790
So you lied to us about
Amy going out of town?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.523
I was scared to say
anything in front of Molly.

13:14.524 --> 13:15.925
Scared? Why?

13:15.926 --> 13:19.428
Amy blew off Denver
to chase a big account.

13:19.429 --> 13:21.270
But Amy was dead
when we talked to you.

13:21.271 --> 13:23.232
Why would you care
if Molly found out?

13:23.233 --> 13:25.234
Unless you wanted
the account for yourself.

13:25.235 --> 13:26.535
Oh.

13:26.536 --> 13:30.079
Detectives, I'm not
a violent person.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.881
Try again.

13:31.882 --> 13:33.883
Five years ago...
Assault and battery,

13:33.884 --> 13:36.085
reduced to a misdemeanor?

13:36.086 --> 13:38.317
I was in veterinary
school interning at the zoo.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.319
Some drunk tried
to jump a fence,

13:40.320 --> 13:43.292
so I tackled him, and
the jerk pressed charges.

13:43.293 --> 13:44.954
Look... (Sighs)

13:44.955 --> 13:48.858
Amy gave me a chance
to reinvent myself.

13:48.859 --> 13:50.159
She took me under her wing.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.131
I would never hurt her.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.533
(Sighs)

13:55.605 --> 13:57.306
Where did you take Amy

13:57.307 --> 13:59.168
after you picked her
up from the airport?

13:59.169 --> 14:02.041
Dr. David cryer's office.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.412
He's a bigwig cardiologist

14:03.413 --> 14:05.244
at the pharmacy and
therapeutics board

14:05.245 --> 14:07.246
at Philly general.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.847
It's a huge account.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.151
Everyone wants it.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.887
So I reviewed the x-rays.

14:17.888 --> 14:19.388
Hairline fractures

14:19.389 --> 14:21.260
to her lower
extremities, wrists,

14:21.261 --> 14:23.362
and right frontal
parietal, all ante mortem.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.934
(Cell phone rings)

14:24.935 --> 14:26.395
(Ring)

14:26.396 --> 14:27.396
(Beeps)

14:27.397 --> 14:29.398
Has Todd said anything to you

14:29.399 --> 14:31.400
about Lacey spending
more time with me?

14:31.401 --> 14:32.641
No.

14:32.642 --> 14:35.174
You know, the more time
she spends at my place,

14:35.175 --> 14:38.347
the more time you
have with toddalone.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.109
(Chuckles) Win-win.

14:40.110 --> 14:42.511
Exactly.

14:42.512 --> 14:44.353
The compound
fracture to her humerus

14:44.354 --> 14:47.056
transected the artery
here, but it was post mortem

14:47.057 --> 14:49.058
so there's still no
explanation for the blood loss.

14:49.059 --> 14:51.961
Well, I have petechial
hemorrhaging

14:51.962 --> 14:53.963
on the serosal surfaces

14:53.964 --> 14:55.995
of the organs,
right and left side.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.128
Could be caused by infection,
asphyxia, toxic exposure.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.569
Or a drug.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.001
(Chuckles)

15:02.002 --> 15:04.003
We need to find out
what kind of drugs

15:04.004 --> 15:06.005
these girls are selling.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.306
(Morris) Could you
get Dr. Cryer out here?

15:07.307 --> 15:09.308
(Woman) I'm sorry, but if
you want to see the doctor,

15:09.309 --> 15:11.140
you have to make an appointment.

15:11.141 --> 15:13.582
I don't think you understand.
This is a murder investigation.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.684
You have to make an appointment.

15:15.685 --> 15:17.416
Do you want to be
arrested for obstruction?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.989
Alice, those are
really pretty flowers.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.320
Are they from someone special?

15:21.321 --> 15:22.921
(Chuckles) No.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.923
They're Dr. Cryer's
favorite... Birds of paradise.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.425
He gets them fresh every day.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.298
So there's nobody special?
Come on. I don't believe that.

15:29.299 --> 15:31.330
Looking forward to
your business, Dr. Cryer.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.332
Jarvis pharmaceuticals
will take good care of you.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.603
I'm sure they will.

15:34.604 --> 15:35.604
Molly.

15:35.605 --> 15:37.206
Fancy seeing you here.

15:37.207 --> 15:39.539
Girl's gotta work, detective.

15:41.211 --> 15:42.412
Who's next?

15:43.273 --> 15:45.044
We are.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.346
Amy was here a
couple of days ago

15:47.347 --> 15:49.418
pitching maven's
new beta blocker.

15:49.419 --> 15:51.280
Why didn't you buy from her?

15:51.281 --> 15:52.721
Molly's company's bigger.

15:52.722 --> 15:54.583
I knew they'd cut a better deal.

15:54.584 --> 15:56.725
Did Amy ever give you
any of maven's products?

15:56.726 --> 15:58.287
Yes.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.129
Did Amy's assistant Beth
ever contact Dr. Cryer?

16:00.130 --> 16:01.390
Just to send over samples.

16:01.391 --> 16:03.392
We're gonna need those samples.

16:03.393 --> 16:05.134
Sorry. I have
confidentiality agreements

16:05.135 --> 16:06.265
with the companies.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.267
Come on, Alice.
You're the gatekeeper.

16:08.268 --> 16:11.140
You know exactly what kind
of samples these girls leave.

16:11.141 --> 16:12.541
Oh, baby, they leave
more than samples.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.403
Try pens,

16:14.404 --> 16:16.275
mugs, squeezy balls,

16:16.276 --> 16:18.277
notepads,

16:18.278 --> 16:20.309
food. What kind of food?

16:20.310 --> 16:21.980
Oysters.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.153
Amy brought them for
me every time we met.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.485
Her boyfriend had a contact.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.487
Boyfriend?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.989
(Morris) Chris, the
way you lied to us,

16:30.990 --> 16:32.991
it wasn't just stupid,
it was insulting.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.724
Youknewwe were talking to
Amy's coworkers, her friends.

16:35.725 --> 16:37.466
What did you think
was gonna happen?

16:37.467 --> 16:38.767
I didn't lie.

16:38.768 --> 16:40.469
You sat there, shucking
oysters in our faces,

16:40.470 --> 16:41.730
while your girlfriend
lay dead in the morgue.

16:41.731 --> 16:44.103
Why didn't you tell us
you were seeing Amy?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.375
Because I wasn't.

16:46.476 --> 16:47.676
(Sighs)

16:47.677 --> 16:49.678
Amy broke up with
me a month ago.

16:49.679 --> 16:51.610
Okay, so Amy comes...
(Cell phone rings)

16:51.611 --> 16:53.512
(Ring)

16:53.513 --> 16:55.314
Amy comes back into town,

16:55.315 --> 16:57.386
you try to hook
up, she refuses...

16:57.387 --> 16:58.687
That the way it went down?

16:58.688 --> 16:59.688
You're wrong.

16:59.689 --> 17:01.650
Amy and I got along.

17:01.651 --> 17:04.193
We're... we're both
from small towns,

17:04.194 --> 17:05.594
blue-collar families.

17:05.595 --> 17:08.097
Amy was...

17:08.098 --> 17:09.558
(Sighs) She was sweet.

17:09.559 --> 17:12.261
But she was also smart, driven.

17:12.262 --> 17:13.402
She knew what she wanted.

17:13.403 --> 17:15.705
And it wasn't you.

17:20.110 --> 17:21.340
How'd she die, anyway?

17:21.341 --> 17:23.572
We think someone
gave her a drug.

17:23.573 --> 17:25.043
Doctor, you...

17:25.044 --> 17:26.445
Did Amy ever talk about
the drugs she was selling,

17:26.446 --> 17:28.417
anything that she had
to be extra careful with?

17:28.418 --> 17:29.779
No. Dr. Hunt.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.052
Outside?

17:35.325 --> 17:39.428
(Indistinct conversations)

17:39.429 --> 17:41.360
You're giving the
suspect information.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.362
I thought he could
help us with c.O.D.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.364
Well, that is your
job, not the suspect's.

17:45.365 --> 17:48.567
And, hey, never bring
that thing in here again.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.069
This was about Lacey.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.373
When you have your
kid, you'll understand.

17:55.345 --> 17:56.705
Lacey...

17:56.706 --> 17:58.607
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

17:58.608 --> 18:00.309
That a family name?

18:00.310 --> 18:01.580
No.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.512
It just...

18:03.513 --> 18:05.484
Came to me the
first time I held her.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.855
She was...

18:06.856 --> 18:08.857
Soft and delicate.

18:08.858 --> 18:12.090
What would've happened if
she was crabby and whiny?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.562
I would've called her bud.

18:13.563 --> 18:16.725
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

18:16.726 --> 18:18.767
(Sighs)

18:18.768 --> 18:20.499
(Panting)

18:20.500 --> 18:22.501
Oh, Dr. Hunt, I'm so
glad I caught you...

18:22.502 --> 18:23.672
Put a rush on those drug samples

18:23.673 --> 18:24.833
that Amy left at cryer's office.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.305
Already done. Can
you just slow down?

18:26.306 --> 18:27.636
And I want results on the trace

18:27.637 --> 18:29.338
that we found under Amy's nails.

18:29.339 --> 18:31.480
Bud wants evidence
linking this Chris Quinn

18:31.481 --> 18:32.681
to Amy's death.

18:32.682 --> 18:34.313
Okay, okay, I'll
look right into it.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.614
Can you just stop for a
second so I can talk to you?

18:35.615 --> 18:38.647
I'm just trying to... Warn you.

18:38.648 --> 18:40.349
(Sighs)

18:40.350 --> 18:42.421
Grandmother, you
really shouldn't touch that.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.453
Oh.

18:44.454 --> 18:46.195
(Clatters)

18:46.196 --> 18:47.596
(Lacey) Grandma, seriously.

18:47.597 --> 18:49.428
Lacey.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.600
Are you all right?

18:51.601 --> 18:53.432
No, she's not.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.663
She called, very upset.

18:54.664 --> 18:56.805
Aren't you, Lacey?

18:56.806 --> 18:59.568
Well, I-I mean, i-i-i guess...

18:59.569 --> 19:00.639
Yeah.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.171
(Knock on door)

19:02.172 --> 19:04.173
Hi. Uh, Ethan said
you wanted to see me.

19:04.174 --> 19:06.275
(Joan) Megan didn't. I did.

19:06.276 --> 19:08.747
I wasn't able to reach Todd,
or he would've been here, too.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.749
You see, you're all
making decisions for Lacey

19:10.750 --> 19:13.182
without asking
whatshereally wants.

19:13.183 --> 19:15.584
I am not the one who's
trying to drag her to California.

19:15.585 --> 19:17.526
Wait. I'm not making
decisions for anybody.

19:17.527 --> 19:19.188
Oh, you spending the
night at Lacey's house

19:19.189 --> 19:20.860
isn't your decision?

19:22.832 --> 19:24.533
Ethan, what is it?

19:24.534 --> 19:26.665
Uh, an update on the trace
UN-under Amy's fingernails.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.666
Can't that wait?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.539
(Kate and Megan) No!

19:30.600 --> 19:32.601
Lace, I'll talk to you later.

19:32.602 --> 19:35.344
Mother...

19:35.345 --> 19:38.448
I don't even know
where to begin.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.252
Thanks a lot, grandma.

19:43.253 --> 19:44.813
I just, um...

19:44.814 --> 19:46.515
I don't want to talk.

19:46.516 --> 19:47.487
Okay. I didn't hear any...

19:47.488 --> 19:49.318
(clears throat) Well,

19:49.319 --> 19:52.421
now I know where you
got your interpersonal skills.

19:52.422 --> 19:53.962
Did you find something?

19:53.963 --> 19:56.525
Yes. The fibrous material
under Amy's fingernails

19:56.526 --> 19:58.527
are tiny bits of
some kind of paper

19:58.528 --> 19:59.968
along with traces of arsenic.

19:59.969 --> 20:03.372
Only there was no
arsenic in her tox.

20:03.373 --> 20:04.603
Still no c.O.D.?

20:04.604 --> 20:06.605
Wait. Can...

20:06.606 --> 20:07.577
(Chuckles)

20:07.578 --> 20:09.438
Okay, it might not
tell us how she died,

20:09.439 --> 20:10.609
but it could tell us where.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.211
I did an autopsy once on a
guy who restored old houses.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.843
He died of arsenic toxicity.

20:14.844 --> 20:19.348
Arsenic used to be used
to preserve wallpaper.

20:19.349 --> 20:22.452
(Water rushing)

20:28.398 --> 20:30.529
Forensics tracked the
wallpaper to locktender houses

20:30.530 --> 20:32.761
built along the river.

20:32.762 --> 20:34.733
The historical society's
trying to save this one.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.235
They're sending us a
list of members, donors,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.767
anyone who might
have had access.

20:38.768 --> 20:41.470
Hey. Looks like we
got nail marks here,

20:41.471 --> 20:43.412
and even a little blood.

20:43.413 --> 20:45.645
She scratched at the walls.

20:48.548 --> 20:49.849
You smell that?

20:52.382 --> 20:53.682
Yeah. Bleach.

20:53.683 --> 20:55.725
(Megan) Go get the luminol.

21:01.291 --> 21:04.294
(Liquid spritzing)

21:11.971 --> 21:13.802
Oh, my god.

21:13.803 --> 21:15.774
This can't all be...

21:15.775 --> 21:17.706
Yeah, it is.

21:17.707 --> 21:20.580
Good god. What happened here?

21:23.983 --> 21:27.957
Now we know where
all of her blood went.

21:32.662 --> 21:33.662
(Morris) It was
Chris, the bartender.

21:33.663 --> 21:34.723
He was angry at Amy,

21:34.724 --> 21:35.894
he saw her at the airport,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.796
grabbed her,
brought her out here.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.398
Well, that's how she got here.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.400
But how the hell does
someone loose this much blood?

21:41.401 --> 21:42.731
(Cell phone rings)

21:42.732 --> 21:43.902
Baker.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.303
(Peter) There were no wounds

21:45.304 --> 21:46.735
that could've caused
blood loss like this.

21:46.736 --> 21:48.036
You gotta go back to
the body, right, doctor?

21:48.037 --> 21:49.608
You guys must have
missed something.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.381
We didn't miss
anything, detective.

21:52.382 --> 21:54.743
I found petechial
hemorrhaging in her organs.

21:54.744 --> 21:56.745
It had to have been
caused by some kind of drug

21:56.746 --> 21:58.447
that Amy ingested,

21:58.448 --> 21:59.818
something that made her

21:59.819 --> 22:01.490
exsanguinate from every orifice.

22:01.491 --> 22:03.922
She would've been
in agony... Screaming,

22:03.923 --> 22:05.654
flailing around.

22:05.655 --> 22:08.957
It's possible that the
wounds are self-inflicted.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.700
(Sighs) That was Lopez.

22:11.701 --> 22:12.961
Chris alibied out.

22:12.962 --> 22:14.763
He was working
the night Amy died.

22:14.764 --> 22:15.934
Peter,

22:15.935 --> 22:18.036
get blood samples to the lab.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.038
You shouldn't have any problem

22:20.039 --> 22:21.740
finding enough.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.841
(Gloves crinkle)

22:22.842 --> 22:24.614
Yeah.

22:25.815 --> 22:27.716
Okay. I'll put a rush on 'em.

22:27.717 --> 22:29.718
Bye. What's up?

22:29.719 --> 22:30.680
That was Megan.

22:30.681 --> 22:32.821
Amy died of a
systemic bleed out.

22:32.822 --> 22:34.783
Oh, man. That's a
horrible way to go.

22:34.784 --> 22:36.485
Yeah. Get the lab to
run those drug samples

22:36.486 --> 22:38.356
for anticoagulants.
(Cell phone rings)

22:38.357 --> 22:40.989
(Ring)

22:40.990 --> 22:42.731
You know there are other things

22:42.732 --> 22:44.032
that can cause
someone to bleed out?

22:44.033 --> 22:46.034
Yeah, and we're gonna
rule out every one of 'em.

22:46.035 --> 22:47.866
Listen, if she picked
up some kind of toxin

22:47.867 --> 22:49.137
or hemorrhagic virus,

22:49.138 --> 22:50.769
we could have a full-blown
crisis on our hands.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.572
(Telephone rings)

22:53.573 --> 22:54.743
(Ring)

22:54.744 --> 22:55.744
(Clears throat)

22:55.745 --> 22:57.446
(Ring)

22:57.447 --> 22:58.807
Should I even ask?

22:58.808 --> 22:59.808
(Sighs)

22:59.809 --> 23:02.752
I'm just tired of
being in the middle.

23:06.616 --> 23:09.989
Sister, I feel your pain.

23:13.062 --> 23:14.723
(Shutter clicks)

23:14.724 --> 23:16.726
(Click)

23:34.784 --> 23:36.615
Your corporation donates

23:36.616 --> 23:38.687
to the historical
society, Dr. Cryer,

23:38.688 --> 23:41.490
and you personally are
the single largest contributor

23:41.491 --> 23:43.892
to the locktender
house restoration.

23:43.893 --> 23:45.824
I support my community. So?

23:45.825 --> 23:47.125
(Sam) You reserved that house

23:47.126 --> 23:48.797
for a private party
the night Amy died.

23:48.798 --> 23:50.759
(Chuckles) You
guys are way off base.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.000
(Megan) Really.

23:52.001 --> 23:53.462
You're a cardiologist.

23:53.463 --> 23:54.863
You have access
to anticoagulants.

23:54.864 --> 23:57.636
What happened, Amy
discover you were married?

23:57.637 --> 23:59.839
We can put you in that room.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.772
It was a fling.

24:03.773 --> 24:05.173
There was nothing
serious between us.

24:05.174 --> 24:07.215
So you just brought her flowers
and watched her bleed to death?

24:07.216 --> 24:09.448
That is not what happened.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.521
(Exhales deeply) Look...

24:12.522 --> 24:13.852
We went into the house.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.184
Amy said she wanted to change
into something nice for me,

24:16.185 --> 24:17.926
so I went outside
to call my wife

24:17.927 --> 24:19.227
to tell her I'd be working late.

24:19.228 --> 24:20.659
Classy.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.532
When I went back in that
room, Amy was already dead.

24:23.533 --> 24:26.795
Amy tried to claw her
way out of that room.

24:26.796 --> 24:28.797
She had to have been
screaming in agony.

24:28.798 --> 24:30.499
You didn't hear that?

24:30.500 --> 24:31.940
I had to walk to the top of
the hill to get cell reception.

24:31.941 --> 24:33.972
(Chuckles) Oh,
right. Your wife. Mm.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.674
Look, there was
blood everywhere,

24:35.675 --> 24:37.175
so I panicked, I wrapped
her up in a blanket,

24:37.176 --> 24:39.247
and I carried her to the river.

24:39.248 --> 24:40.909
Mm-hmm. And that's when
you broke out the bleach.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.110
I didn't want it to
get back to me.

24:42.111 --> 24:43.652
It could ruin my marriage.

24:43.653 --> 24:45.053
(Morris) Oh, it's gonna
do more than that.

24:45.054 --> 24:47.756
Put your hands behind your
back. You're under arrest.

24:47.757 --> 24:49.588
(Scoffs) What for?

24:49.589 --> 24:51.890
If it were up to me,
being a horrible person.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.992
But try tampering
with evidence...

24:53.993 --> 24:55.764
Disposal of a body...

24:55.765 --> 24:56.925
And possibly murder.

24:56.926 --> 24:58.697
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.998
Anything you say
can... This is ridiculous.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.930
And will be used
in a court of law.

25:01.931 --> 25:03.632
You have the
right to an attorney.

25:03.633 --> 25:04.903
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

25:04.904 --> 25:06.975
and attorney will be provided
for you... (Dials, line clicks)

25:06.976 --> 25:08.236
(Peter) Hello.

25:08.237 --> 25:11.980
Peter, I need a list of
all the anticoagulants

25:11.981 --> 25:13.982
that Dr. Cryer
used in his practice.

25:13.983 --> 25:15.684
(Peter) You got it.

25:15.685 --> 25:17.686
And, oh, you're
interior decorator called.

25:17.687 --> 25:18.987
Designer.

25:18.988 --> 25:19.919
What?

25:19.920 --> 25:21.850
It's an interior d...
Oh, never mind.

25:21.851 --> 25:23.552
What... what did she want?

25:23.553 --> 25:25.524
You're not gonna like it.

25:26.896 --> 25:28.957
First you insist that
I use your designer,

25:28.958 --> 25:31.560
and then you tell her that she
can't work for me anymore?

25:31.561 --> 25:33.061
Megan... and... and by the way,

25:33.062 --> 25:35.233
who the hell are you
to come to my office

25:35.234 --> 25:37.235
and lecture me about parenting?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.909
Megan, this is assistant
district attorney Ben Allen.

25:40.910 --> 25:43.111
Ben, I'd like you to meet
my daughter Megan.

25:43.112 --> 25:44.213
Hello.

25:47.617 --> 25:50.018
Could you please
excuse us for a minute?

25:50.019 --> 25:52.020
Sure.

25:52.021 --> 25:54.022
Judge, to be continued.

25:54.023 --> 25:55.554
It was nice meeting you.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.690
(Door closes)

26:01.691 --> 26:03.031
He's good-looking, isn't he?

26:03.032 --> 26:05.163
Not that he'd be
interested in you at all

26:05.164 --> 26:06.334
after that entrance.

26:06.335 --> 26:08.036
Why'd you cancel the designer?

26:08.037 --> 26:09.898
Well, in your office,

26:09.899 --> 26:11.940
I just realized

26:11.941 --> 26:15.074
that I was interfering.

26:16.145 --> 26:18.046
Interfering?

26:18.047 --> 26:21.810
You accused me of doing to Lacey
what you have been doing to me

26:21.811 --> 26:23.882
for my entire life...

26:23.883 --> 26:25.754
Controlling everything,

26:25.755 --> 26:28.016
my schools, my career.

26:28.017 --> 26:29.658
You picked out what
clothes I should wear,

26:29.659 --> 26:30.889
the color of my bedroom...

26:30.890 --> 26:32.691
(Voice breaks) The boys
that I should be dating.

26:32.692 --> 26:33.962
And look at the result.

26:33.963 --> 26:35.964
Yeah, look at them. I resent
the hell out of you for it.

26:35.965 --> 26:37.996
Well, maybe you
should learn from it, too.

26:37.997 --> 26:40.128
(Normal voice)
Oh, don't you worry.

26:40.129 --> 26:42.871
Lacey is never
gonna feel about me

26:42.872 --> 26:45.304
the way I feel about you.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.710
(Door closes)

26:59.188 --> 27:00.318
Hey, Peter, did you get a list

27:00.319 --> 27:01.319
of anticoagulants
from cryer's office?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.691
They won't give it up.

27:02.692 --> 27:04.192
Hmm. Seems your
charms only go so far.

27:04.193 --> 27:05.894
Wait, wait, wait. That...
This might not matter.

27:05.895 --> 27:07.225
I-I checked with the fda.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.728
None of the anticoags
approved for sale in the U.S.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.229
Match Amy's symptoms.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.401
Maybe it was ebola.

27:13.402 --> 27:14.733
Ebo...

27:14.734 --> 27:16.234
Dani, I hired you
to be a driver,

27:16.235 --> 27:17.836
not a medical consultant.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.137
Easy, Dr. Brumfield.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.769
I just dropped off a body.

27:20.770 --> 27:22.270
Yeah, easy, Dr. Brumfield.

27:22.271 --> 27:24.843
You know, I think ebola is
an interesting suggestion.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.976
If it was ebola, you two
would be dead by now, fool.

27:27.977 --> 27:29.748
Maybe we're looking
for an experimental drug.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.751
How are we gonna get specs
on an experimental drug?

27:32.752 --> 27:35.083
Some companies do
their clinical trials overseas.

27:35.084 --> 27:36.755
So?

27:36.756 --> 27:37.986
(Australian accent) Uh, hello.

27:37.987 --> 27:39.157
My name is Dr. Dunlop,

27:39.158 --> 27:42.761
and I have a cardiology
practice in Sydney.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.263
And, uh, a colleague
of mine, Dr. Cryer,

27:45.264 --> 27:47.165
recommended that I contact you.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.237
That accent is
hilarious. I'll hold.

27:49.238 --> 27:50.769
You like that? How about this?

27:50.770 --> 27:52.270
(German accent)
This is Dr. Gross.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.743
Dear, I'm calling
about anticoagulants.

27:54.744 --> 27:55.774
(Normal voice) Oh,
how about this one?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.275
(Irish accent)
This is Dr. Gross.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.676
Do you have any new
your drugs on the market...

27:58.677 --> 28:00.909
Shh.

28:00.910 --> 28:02.410
(People speaking indistinctly)

28:02.411 --> 28:03.912
(Kate) Did you see this e-mail?

28:03.913 --> 28:05.413
None of the drug samples
from our pharm girls

28:05.414 --> 28:06.815
have anticoags in 'em.

28:06.816 --> 28:08.286
Well, maybe that's because

28:08.287 --> 28:10.288
what killed Amy isn't
on the market yet.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.790
Jarvis international
is coming out

28:11.791 --> 28:13.862
with a new anticoagulant,
and guess who the rep is.

28:13.863 --> 28:15.423
Molly Anderson?

28:15.424 --> 28:17.195
Bud and Sam are trying
to track her down right now.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.827
Well, see if they
can get samples.

28:18.828 --> 28:19.828
(Cell phone rings) Okay.

28:19.829 --> 28:20.829
(Ring)

28:20.830 --> 28:21.830
(Sighs)

28:22.972 --> 28:24.132
(Indistinct conversations)

28:24.133 --> 28:26.174
(Todd) So then just tell me.

28:26.175 --> 28:28.877
Why have you been
avoiding my calls?

28:28.878 --> 28:31.439
(Sighs)

28:31.440 --> 28:34.943
I guess I've...

28:34.944 --> 28:37.245
Realized that...

28:37.246 --> 28:38.817
Getting involved
with you wasn't...

28:38.818 --> 28:40.919
Such a great idea.

28:40.920 --> 28:41.990
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

28:41.991 --> 28:43.321
Because?

28:43.322 --> 28:46.324
Your my colleague's
ex-husband, for starters.

28:46.325 --> 28:49.397
And Megan's trying to forge
a relationship with Lacey,

28:49.398 --> 28:51.499
and I keep winding up in
the middle of it somehow.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.802
No, no, i... Kate, no.
Those are just excuses.

28:53.803 --> 28:55.433
That's got nothing to
do with you and me.

28:55.434 --> 28:56.965
That's exactly the problem.

28:56.966 --> 28:59.507
This has never been
just about you and me.

28:59.508 --> 29:01.009
(Sighs)

29:01.010 --> 29:03.441
Look, I care about
you, and I would never

29:03.442 --> 29:04.973
ask you to change
your life for me,

29:04.974 --> 29:07.415
but I just know that
this isn't working.

29:07.416 --> 29:09.848
(Sighs)

29:09.849 --> 29:12.881
I'm sorry.

29:12.882 --> 29:15.253
It's over.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.986
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

29:17.987 --> 29:20.990
(Woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

29:22.892 --> 29:25.994
Molly.

29:25.995 --> 29:28.266
We're gonna need to
take a look in your bag.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.467
What for?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.269
Amy was killed by a
powerful anticoagulant.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.271
Jarvis is rolling out a
new one next month.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.074
As the rep, you have the
samples and the spec sheets.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.075
We want to see them.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.106
You think that I killed Amy?

29:38.107 --> 29:39.277
You were after the same account.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.508
We can take a
look at the bag here

29:40.509 --> 29:41.980
or at the police station.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.211
(Scoffs)

29:43.212 --> 29:44.953
(Woman continues
speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

29:44.954 --> 29:46.314
Hey, be my guest.

29:46.315 --> 29:48.857
(Woman continues
speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

29:48.858 --> 29:51.459
There are lots of new
anticoags out there.

29:51.460 --> 29:52.861
And there are a lot of reps

29:52.862 --> 29:54.792
that wanted that
account with cryer.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.426
(Woman continues
speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

29:58.427 --> 30:01.529
Jarvis said they
sent her the samples.

30:01.530 --> 30:03.031
Where are they?

30:03.032 --> 30:05.203
Just because I landed
the cryer account

30:05.204 --> 30:07.005
doesn't mean that I killed Amy.

30:07.006 --> 30:11.179
(Indistinct conversations)

30:11.180 --> 30:12.210
(Woman continues
speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

30:12.211 --> 30:13.842
Molly, wait.

30:13.843 --> 30:15.243
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

30:15.244 --> 30:17.946
You knew Amy was having
an affair with Dr. Cryer,

30:17.947 --> 30:19.087
didn't you?

30:19.088 --> 30:20.919
Did she end it with him?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.350
I don't know anything.

30:22.351 --> 30:24.322
(Airplane engines humming)

30:24.323 --> 30:27.255
I thought you were her friend.

30:27.256 --> 30:30.198
Or were you lying
about that, too?

30:30.199 --> 30:33.202
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

30:38.037 --> 30:40.538
We cannot pin Amy's
murder on anyone

30:40.539 --> 30:42.540
until we confirm
what drug killed her.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.542
So I take it you struck
out with Molly. (Sighs)

30:44.543 --> 30:46.544
(Elevator bell dings) She might
have been smart and driven,

30:46.545 --> 30:48.046
but Amy was naive

30:48.047 --> 30:50.218
to think that girl
was her friend.

30:50.219 --> 30:53.481
Dr. Hunt. Dr. Hunt.

30:53.482 --> 30:55.954
Speak of the devil.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.926
What happened, you
missed your flight?

30:57.927 --> 30:59.527
My best friend is murdered,

30:59.528 --> 31:02.160
and all I care about
is another sale. It's...

31:02.161 --> 31:03.892
The pharm business is cutthroat,

31:03.893 --> 31:05.964
but Amy still cared
about her friends.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.136
And she was always there for me.

31:08.137 --> 31:11.240
The least I can do
is be there for her.

31:14.503 --> 31:17.305
Specs on Jarvis'
new anticoagulant.

31:17.306 --> 31:18.646
There's also something else.

31:18.647 --> 31:20.979
Amy was having an
affair with Dr. Cryer.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.610
But you have it backwards.

31:22.611 --> 31:24.252
Amy didn't break up with cryer.

31:24.253 --> 31:26.014
She was madly in love with him.

31:26.015 --> 31:27.986
He told her he was
gonna leave his wife.

31:27.987 --> 31:30.588
(Indistinct conversations)

31:30.589 --> 31:32.090
Thank you.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.561
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

31:33.562 --> 31:36.265
Just catch whoever
did this to Amy.

31:37.997 --> 31:41.029
None of these drug
reactions match.

31:41.030 --> 31:43.031
(Inhales and exhales)

31:43.032 --> 31:45.033
I think it's time for Dr. Cryer

31:45.034 --> 31:47.536
to see his girlfriend again.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.981
What is this? Why am I here?

31:52.982 --> 31:55.113
We still don't know
what killed Amy.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.414
And since you watched her die,

31:56.415 --> 31:58.616
we thought you could help.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.289
I didn't kill her.

32:04.954 --> 32:07.255
So... (Exhales)

32:07.256 --> 32:08.997
You want us to believe

32:08.998 --> 32:13.031
that you went outside
because Amy wanted to change.

32:13.032 --> 32:16.304
And you called your wife.

32:16.305 --> 32:18.166
How long were you gone?

32:18.167 --> 32:19.237
(Exhales)

32:19.238 --> 32:21.009
20 minutes.

32:21.010 --> 32:23.241
My, uh...

32:23.242 --> 32:25.073
My daughter wanted
a bedtime story.

32:25.074 --> 32:27.575
You told your kid a story
while Amy bled to death?

32:27.576 --> 32:30.118
Like I said, I just...

32:30.119 --> 32:32.180
I found her dead on the floor.

32:32.181 --> 32:33.251
How?

32:33.252 --> 32:36.054
What'd she look like?

32:36.055 --> 32:37.225
(Exhales)

32:37.226 --> 32:39.557
She was, um...

32:39.558 --> 32:41.559
Frozen in the fetal position.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.661
Frozen in terror?

32:43.662 --> 32:46.564
Fists clenched, mouth open?

32:46.565 --> 32:48.266
Uh, no. She was...

32:48.267 --> 32:50.538
Holding herself.

32:50.539 --> 32:52.101
What do you mean?

32:54.173 --> 32:56.045
Show me.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.207
Um...

32:59.208 --> 33:01.179
This arm

33:01.180 --> 33:03.981
was, um...

33:03.982 --> 33:06.284
Wrapped under
here, like she was...

33:06.285 --> 33:09.158
Trying to stop the pain.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.161
Get him out of here.

33:18.327 --> 33:21.199
What are you looking for?

33:21.200 --> 33:23.332
Her brachial vein.

33:26.675 --> 33:28.036
Oh.

33:28.037 --> 33:29.437
I missed it

33:29.438 --> 33:32.241
because of the fish bites.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.682
(Sam) Whoa.

33:34.683 --> 33:37.746
What are those from, injections?

33:40.249 --> 33:42.791
Fangs.

33:50.459 --> 33:52.230
So she was bitten by a snake?

33:52.231 --> 33:54.062
Its hemotoxic venom
entered her body

33:54.063 --> 33:56.804
through the brachial vein,
causing her to exsanguinate.

33:56.805 --> 33:59.167
I ran the specs of
venom by a herpetologist.

33:59.168 --> 34:01.369
He's pretty sure we're
looking at this little fella...

34:01.370 --> 34:03.071
A gaboon viper from Africa.

34:03.072 --> 34:04.572
The timeline matches up.

34:04.573 --> 34:06.814
One bite can cause you
to bleed out in 20 minutes.

34:06.815 --> 34:08.646
All right. So how
does an African snake

34:08.647 --> 34:10.348
wind up in an old
house in Philly?

34:10.349 --> 34:12.480
Uh, maybe it
escaped from the zoo.

34:12.481 --> 34:14.152
Or maybe it was stolen.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.624
Amy's assistant
used to work at a zoo.

34:16.625 --> 34:18.055
Follow up with bud and Sam.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.158
In the meantime, we
need to find that snake.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.489
Oh, I hate snakes.

34:21.490 --> 34:23.731
It's the murder weapon.

34:23.732 --> 34:25.233
I'll look for it.

34:25.234 --> 34:27.696
Not by yourself, you won't.

34:29.298 --> 34:30.738
You're the animal
control expert.

34:30.739 --> 34:32.770
You know, where...
Where would it be hiding?

34:32.771 --> 34:34.772
It's a nocturnal snake.

34:34.773 --> 34:37.845
It could be under the house...

34:37.846 --> 34:39.647
Or in the rafters.

34:39.648 --> 34:40.808
What?

34:40.809 --> 34:42.380
In the rafters?

34:42.381 --> 34:45.082
Who's going up there?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.484
Hopefully...

34:46.485 --> 34:48.856
(Man) ♪ every day
when I'm at work ♪

34:48.857 --> 34:50.418
He'll come to us.

34:50.419 --> 34:52.820
(Man singing R&B indistinctly)

34:52.821 --> 34:54.492
Uh, excuse me, sir.

34:54.493 --> 34:57.125
Sir. Hey. Wh-what's that for?

34:57.126 --> 34:59.527
Vipers are attracted
to vibrations,

34:59.528 --> 35:01.829
music.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.331
Now remember...

35:03.332 --> 35:05.633
Don't do anything to provoke it.

35:05.634 --> 35:08.406
One bite... it's over.

35:08.407 --> 35:11.239
That's it? Nothing we can do?

35:11.240 --> 35:12.880
(Man continues
singing indistinctly)

35:12.881 --> 35:14.582
Severing a limb could work.

35:14.583 --> 35:16.744
I'll start under the house.

35:16.745 --> 35:18.516
That wasn't comforting.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.488
I tell you what, if
the snake bites me,

35:20.489 --> 35:22.150
just cut off my arm.

35:22.151 --> 35:24.121
Yeah, yeah, and if the
snake bites me, just...

35:24.122 --> 35:26.154
Tell Dani I was thinking of her.

35:26.155 --> 35:28.296
I'm telling you, don't waste
your time on that temptress.

35:28.297 --> 35:30.858
(Man continues
singing indistinctly)

35:30.859 --> 35:31.859
Ethan?

35:31.860 --> 35:32.860
I see it.

35:32.861 --> 35:34.131
What do we do?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.433
Just... where's the animal man?

35:35.434 --> 35:36.604
(Whispers) Walk.
Just get outta here.

35:36.605 --> 35:40.808
(Man continues
singing indistinctly)

35:40.809 --> 35:42.670
He's a little guy.

35:42.671 --> 35:45.213
Yeah. Most people don't know,

35:45.214 --> 35:48.216
their venom is most
potent when they're babies.

35:48.217 --> 35:50.318
Did you find him in water?

35:50.319 --> 35:52.520
No. Why?

35:52.521 --> 35:55.183
There's an odd rough
patch on his skin.

35:55.184 --> 35:57.185
I've seen that happen
to snakeskin shoes

35:57.186 --> 35:59.857
when you step in saltwater.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.329
Don't ask.

36:01.330 --> 36:02.890
Mm-hmm.

36:02.891 --> 36:05.233
Ethan...

36:05.234 --> 36:08.296
Hand me a swab...

36:08.297 --> 36:09.797
A long one.

36:09.798 --> 36:13.802
Oh, oh, oh. Here we go.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.917
(Megan) Beautiful, isn't it?

36:29.918 --> 36:32.660
Uh, it looks like a snowflake.

36:32.661 --> 36:34.292
That is a form of algae

36:34.293 --> 36:35.963
that is found on the oysters

36:35.964 --> 36:38.326
that you serve in your bar.

36:38.327 --> 36:40.328
When you put the
snake in Amy's bag,

36:40.329 --> 36:42.970
your hands were still wet
from unpacking the oysters,

36:42.971 --> 36:45.633
and the saltwater
dripped on the snake.

36:45.634 --> 36:47.575
(Morris) We talked to
sue, your buddy at t.S.A.

36:47.576 --> 36:50.207
You know about the
animals they confiscate,

36:50.208 --> 36:53.481
including the snakes that came
in from Africa four days ago.

36:53.482 --> 36:56.213
You slipped one into Amy's
bag when she wasn't looking.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.585
And why would I do that?

36:57.586 --> 36:58.916
Amy had her whole
life planned out.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.218
She knew what she wanted,
and you weren't a part of it.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.891
I told you, Amy
and I were friends.

37:03.892 --> 37:06.223
I had nothing to do with this.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.225
You're lying, Mr. Quinn.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.258
The diatoms that we
found in Amy's bone marrow

37:10.259 --> 37:11.699
match the ones from the oysters

37:11.700 --> 37:14.231
that you served her in your
bar on the night she died.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.234
Only place in Philly where
you can find 'em fresh.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.937
Come on. This was just
supposed to be a joke.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.310
(Sighs) Help us understand.

37:22.311 --> 37:23.641
(Exhales)

37:23.642 --> 37:26.414
Amy said she couldn't date
me on account of her job.

37:26.415 --> 37:27.915
That night... at the bar,

37:27.916 --> 37:29.417
she kept talking
about that doctor.

37:29.418 --> 37:30.948
I guess it's okay to go
out with some rich guy,

37:30.949 --> 37:33.451
but not slum it with
someone like me.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.423
(Sam) Oh. (Chuckles)
You were jealous.

37:35.424 --> 37:38.426
You wanted to
teach her a lesson.

37:38.427 --> 37:39.957
I heard about...

37:39.958 --> 37:41.659
The baby snakes

37:41.660 --> 37:43.731
that t.S.A. Found in
someone's luggage,

37:43.732 --> 37:45.793
so, uh...

37:45.794 --> 37:48.696
So I took one and
I put it in her bag.

37:48.697 --> 37:52.040
Weren't you afraid it
was gonna bite you?

37:54.343 --> 37:57.745
I thought it was
too small to hurt...

37:57.746 --> 37:59.748
Hurt anyone, so...

38:01.480 --> 38:04.011
You're lucky to
be alive, Mr. Quinn.

38:04.012 --> 38:07.014
Because of your little joke,

38:07.015 --> 38:10.017
Amy died a horrific death.

38:10.018 --> 38:12.059
20 minutes of agony...

38:12.060 --> 38:15.623
As that venom ran
through her system...

38:15.624 --> 38:16.994
As she bled out

38:16.995 --> 38:20.669
from every part of her body.

38:24.673 --> 38:27.074
Amy's mother's on her way up.

38:27.075 --> 38:29.708
Okay, I'm almost done here.

38:33.081 --> 38:36.014
I owe you an apology.

38:37.446 --> 38:38.586
What for?

38:38.587 --> 38:40.918
(Sighs)

38:40.919 --> 38:43.621
For letting myself get
caught in the middle.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.394
For not...

38:46.395 --> 38:48.396
Totally thinking through
what would happen

38:48.397 --> 38:49.397
if I dated Todd.

38:49.398 --> 38:51.459
It was selfish.

38:51.460 --> 38:54.062
And now it's over.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.036
(Mrs. Green) Dr. Murphy?

38:59.408 --> 39:01.510
Mrs. Green, please.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.597
Either of you have children?

39:30.499 --> 39:32.640
I...

39:32.641 --> 39:34.543
Have a daughter.

39:37.746 --> 39:41.549
You want the world for them...

39:41.550 --> 39:44.613
To protect them and guide them.

39:45.784 --> 39:48.557
But the tighter you
try to hold them...

39:51.460 --> 39:53.061
The more they slip away.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.129
It's time to go home, Amy.

40:02.130 --> 40:03.531
(Cries)

40:03.532 --> 40:06.505
My sweet, sweet, little girl.

40:14.883 --> 40:16.484
Okay, I got it.

40:16.485 --> 40:17.985
Watermelon. (Chuckles)

40:17.986 --> 40:20.147
Now since when have
you been craving...

40:20.148 --> 40:21.719
No, no.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.150
I got it.

40:23.151 --> 40:25.152
I'll be home in an hour.

40:25.153 --> 40:26.924
You, too.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.827
(Receiver clatters) (Laughs) Now
where are you gonna find watermelon

40:29.828 --> 40:31.158
in Philly this time of the year?

40:31.159 --> 40:33.160
Well, I'll start at
the Italian market.

40:33.161 --> 40:36.203
And after that, I'll
put out an a.P.B.

40:36.204 --> 40:39.136
(People speaking indistinctly)

40:39.137 --> 40:40.538
What's this?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.109
Well, you know, like you said,

40:42.110 --> 40:43.671
naming a kid's a big decision.

40:43.672 --> 40:46.774
And you need all
the help you can get.

40:46.775 --> 40:48.175
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

40:48.176 --> 40:50.578
(Sighs) I think that one has
a section on opera singers.

40:50.579 --> 40:52.480
Thank you, Sam.

40:52.481 --> 40:54.923
Jeannie will be very touched.

40:57.526 --> 40:59.857
I can't believe grandma
dragged me into your office.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.158
That's all right.

41:01.159 --> 41:04.963
I've crashed her
office more than once.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.666
Lace...

41:08.667 --> 41:11.468
I'm sorry if you felt like I was

41:11.469 --> 41:13.901
deciding everything for you.

41:13.902 --> 41:16.904
I know it bugs me when
people do that to me.

41:16.905 --> 41:18.946
It drives you totally nuts.

41:18.947 --> 41:20.477
(Laughs)

41:20.478 --> 41:22.149
Then I'm not gonna
do it anymore.

41:22.150 --> 41:24.151
Truth is, you have two homes now

41:24.152 --> 41:26.483
and two parents that
love you very much.

41:26.484 --> 41:27.816
Now follow me.

41:48.577 --> 41:50.137
What happened?

41:50.138 --> 41:52.880
Nothing.

41:52.881 --> 41:54.211
It's yours...

41:54.212 --> 41:57.514
To make whatever
you want it to be.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.686
Really?

41:58.687 --> 42:00.247
I get to design it?

42:00.248 --> 42:02.550
(Chuckles) It's your room.

42:02.551 --> 42:04.521
A place to dream

42:04.522 --> 42:06.854
and make decisions...

42:06.855 --> 42:09.226
All by yourself.

42:09.227 --> 42:12.700
And if you want help...

42:12.701 --> 42:14.933
I'll be right here.
