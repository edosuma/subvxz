WEBVTT

00:00.438 --> 00:01.835
Me mum always says it,

00:01.863 --> 00:05.008
"If I could slap the stupid out
of ya, there'd be nothin' left."

00:05.040 --> 00:07.129
Your mum was drinking
while pregnant with you?

00:07.152 --> 00:09.932
- Yeah.
- That can fuck with kids' brains, you know?

00:09.955 --> 00:11.952
Oi! What the hell?

00:12.131 --> 00:13.435
- Fuck.
- Oh!

00:13.464 --> 00:15.347
Those photos, the ones
that Marie's getting in?

00:15.353 --> 00:17.915
They show that tattoo,
the back of your head.

00:17.927 --> 00:19.406
You have a history of epilepsy.

00:19.589 --> 00:22.180
And in light of these results,
you shouldn't be boxing.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.740
I know about your aneurysm.

00:24.172 --> 00:25.595
And what's this one?

00:25.640 --> 00:28.079
- "Ruby's the killer."
- That's not my writing.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.542
- Ruby didn't kill no-one.
- Yeah.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.004
Bloody hell. Just chuck it.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.190
Anyone wanna say anything?
'Cos I'm up for a chat.

00:33.206 --> 00:34.502
Why are you provoking them?

00:34.518 --> 00:36.925
Because if they're afraid
of me, that gives me power.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.749
And power is safety in here.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.223
Are the police looking at Kosta?

00:40.239 --> 00:42.047
Cops have got CCTV of the killer.

00:42.058 --> 00:44.572
They can't see who it is, but
there's a bloodstain on the sleeve.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.192
We need to find that hoodie.

00:46.990 --> 00:49.262
I found where Kosta keeps her stash.

00:49.387 --> 00:51.183
That's definitely not mine.

00:51.227 --> 00:53.168
- Get the cops down here.
- I didn't kill the bitch!

00:53.192 --> 00:56.170
- Let's go.
- It wasn't mine. It wasn't, it was a setup!

00:56.200 --> 00:57.879
She'd better go down for this.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.295
She deserves a fucking life sentence.

01:00.338 --> 01:02.394
Well, at least she won't be
pitching for Top Dog today.

01:02.399 --> 01:05.346
There's, uh, talk of a Top Dog
vote. I wanna see how it plays out.

01:05.361 --> 01:06.766
What about Marie?

02:08.185 --> 02:10.471
The blood on Kosta's
hoodie's not a match for Kaz.

02:10.477 --> 02:12.598
And it has to be Kaz's to hold her.

02:19.558 --> 02:22.142
Only took those dumb-fuck pigs a week.

02:22.979 --> 02:24.997
A lot can happen in a week.

02:29.682 --> 02:30.864
Vicky.

02:30.989 --> 02:33.724
- It's good to see you out.
- Fucking bitch.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.008
You planted that hoodie.

02:35.021 --> 02:38.496
Is that any way to talk to your
new Top Dog? Where's the respect?

02:38.509 --> 02:40.952
- Respect this.
- Kosta!

02:41.077 --> 02:42.475
Get to your unit.

02:42.868 --> 02:45.115
You've been out of the loop, hon.

02:45.176 --> 02:48.915
- Bitch set me up.
- Or back to the slot. Your choice.

02:48.962 --> 02:51.774
And the rest of you,
clear the corridor now.

02:53.953 --> 02:57.292
Uh, not you, Winter.
Governor wants to see you.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.329
About time.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.088
The prison system
murdered her in cold blood.

03:03.115 --> 03:04.667
Will Jackson, the current Governor,

03:04.714 --> 03:07.264
what's he doing to give her
the justice she deserves?

03:07.320 --> 03:09.767
I'll tell you what. Sweet fuck-all!

03:09.821 --> 03:11.082
Down with the Governor!

03:11.098 --> 03:12.778
- Down with the Governor!
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

03:13.041 --> 03:14.326
Come in.

03:17.191 --> 03:18.638
Thank you, Ms Bennett.

03:21.703 --> 03:23.786
So, you've been avoiding me, hmm?

03:24.283 --> 03:26.700
Uh, I just had a bit on my plate.

03:27.062 --> 03:28.778
'Cos I thought it was customary

03:28.784 --> 03:30.521
for the Governor and
Top Dog to negotiate

03:30.532 --> 03:32.162
the terms of their relationship.

03:33.511 --> 03:35.983
So, where are you at with Kaz's murder?

03:36.108 --> 03:38.703
- Word is Kosta didn't do it.
- Still could have.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.986
- Then why is she walking free?
- It's hardly free.

03:41.034 --> 03:44.429
The women are scared and it's my
responsibility now to protect them.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.214
- OK, then help me.
- If I knew who did this,

03:47.225 --> 03:49.421
- I would tell you in a heartbeat.
- You'd lag?

03:49.687 --> 03:50.928
Come on.

03:51.333 --> 03:54.144
You and I are in a
unique situation, Will.

03:54.528 --> 03:56.951
You run the prison, I
run the women, right?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.417
We can both get what we want from this.

03:59.590 --> 04:01.117
OK.

04:02.061 --> 04:03.847
What do you want, Marie?

04:07.339 --> 04:10.005
I wanna feel safe. I want
to have my voice heard.

04:10.447 --> 04:12.163
I'll always listen. You know that.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.396
We're lucky to have you, Will.

04:16.863 --> 04:18.278
I'm lucky.

04:24.770 --> 04:26.680
Booms, come in here!

04:26.734 --> 04:29.411
- Oh, no, I gotta go see Dr Greg...
- No, just for a sec.

04:29.443 --> 04:32.616
Come on! OK. OK.

04:34.715 --> 04:37.246
Sophie's first night in here,

04:37.263 --> 04:40.047
I heard her crying in the next cell

04:40.112 --> 04:43.680
and I went in and I curled
up on the bed next to her,

04:43.728 --> 04:45.391
and I held her.

04:46.157 --> 04:49.028
I remember it. I remember it.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.918
Right, all of these memories.

04:50.945 --> 04:52.295
Like, last week,

04:52.301 --> 04:55.123
they were just friggin' words.
But now I can remember all of them,

04:55.150 --> 04:56.316
almost all of it!

04:56.354 --> 04:57.909
- No!
- Yes!

04:57.936 --> 05:00.122
So, like, the meds are
really, really working?

05:00.143 --> 05:02.836
- Oh, God, I wish Kaz was here to see this.
- Yeah.

05:02.874 --> 05:04.584
- And you know what I'm gonna do?
- What?

05:04.585 --> 05:07.278
I am gonna get in touch
with my son, Artie,

05:07.326 --> 05:10.456
and I'm... I'm just
gonna reconnect with him.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.820
Jenkins, don't you have to be somewhere?

05:12.874 --> 05:14.924
- Hey?
- Appointment with Dr Miller?

05:14.935 --> 05:19.123
Oh. Oh! Yeah. Oh, Lizzie's back!

05:19.150 --> 05:22.344
I think it's bloody great that
she's remembering everything, eh?

05:22.366 --> 05:24.088
And then I thought, "Oh, shit.

05:24.487 --> 05:27.731
What... what if she remembers
the time that I bashed her?"

05:28.228 --> 05:31.985
Oh, it's 'cos she was a lagger
so, you know, she deserved it.

05:32.110 --> 05:34.360
- OK.
- Yeah.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.598
Yeah, and I think... I think
your drug's helping me, too.

05:37.658 --> 05:39.023
It's making me smarter.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.399
- Well, I'm happy for Liz.
- Yeah.

05:40.415 --> 05:41.791
And for you, Boomer.

05:42.061 --> 05:44.182
In fact, I've got good news.

05:44.307 --> 05:46.012
You want me to have your baby.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.521
OK.

05:50.103 --> 05:52.910
Your day release has been
approved for tomorrow.

05:53.337 --> 05:54.664
Oh.

05:56.672 --> 05:57.887
Hmm.

05:58.777 --> 06:00.342
That's good, isn't it?

06:01.249 --> 06:02.565
Oh.

06:03.936 --> 06:05.788
After what happened to Kaz,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.525
yeah, I wanna get out of here.

06:08.552 --> 06:11.519
Tomorrow's gonna go a long way
to ensuring a successful parole.

06:11.644 --> 06:14.052
Ahh, what if... what if...
what if I stuff it up?

06:14.106 --> 06:16.993
Just remember the strategies
that we've been working on,

06:17.031 --> 06:19.589
to control your behaviour triggers.

06:19.611 --> 06:21.657
- Yeah? Your positive affirmations.
- Yep.

06:21.856 --> 06:25.245
"I'm in charge. I'm in
complete control of meself.

06:25.455 --> 06:27.711
Me willpower has the strength of steel."

06:27.760 --> 06:29.417
And in an emergency?

06:30.237 --> 06:32.779
"Stop, Boomer! Breathe.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.323
Count to ten."

06:34.620 --> 06:37.912
Seven, eight, nine, ten. And...

06:37.944 --> 06:39.541
- ... relax.
- Relax.

06:40.394 --> 06:41.824
OK.

06:42.029 --> 06:44.086
So, what time's Trina picking me up?

06:44.129 --> 06:46.110
Ahh, she's not.

06:46.358 --> 06:50.244
- Your mum, May, is your sponsor for the day.
- Hey? Me mum?

06:50.589 --> 06:52.689
Yeah, is that a problem?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.259
No.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.352
(INDISTINCT YELLING)

07:08.066 --> 07:10.479
Two ramps in a week?
There goes your budget.

07:11.262 --> 07:12.595
Well, that's for me to worry about.

07:12.611 --> 07:14.796
We didn't find anything the last time.

07:14.797 --> 07:16.800
- Why would this time be any different?
- Oh, come on, Vera.

07:16.816 --> 07:18.629
It's Kaz. I have to try.

07:18.986 --> 07:21.475
Oh, Will, you can't
let this be personal.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.222
It's about protecting the women, OK?

07:23.233 --> 07:25.192
If Kosta didn't do it, then who did?

07:26.401 --> 07:28.717
Are police gonna DNA-test
the blood on the hoodie?

07:28.720 --> 07:31.091
Ahh, maybe, but it's not Kaz's blood.

07:31.113 --> 07:32.726
It's probably got Kosta's blood on it.

07:32.926 --> 07:34.766
Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

07:36.801 --> 07:38.237
Hey.

07:38.744 --> 07:42.867
Liz's Birdsworth has been responding
really well to the Psuldrycin.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.280
- Oh, that's great!
- Yeah.

07:44.281 --> 07:46.742
I mean, I was hoping it would
be effective against recidivism

07:46.760 --> 07:49.942
but if this drug can cure dementia,

07:50.233 --> 07:52.759
I mean, shit, Vera, we're
talking about a Nobel Prize.

07:52.802 --> 07:56.120
- Oh, what?
- I mean, I'm almost serious.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.874
And none of this would have
even been possible without you.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.297
- Oh, no, I...
- No, you've been a massive help,

08:01.318 --> 08:03.207
- so thank you.
- Oh!

08:03.229 --> 08:06.573
- Ooh, sorry!
- Oh, it's... that's OK.

08:26.988 --> 08:28.877
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Yep.

08:28.904 --> 08:31.279
- CSDS just finished.
- And?

08:31.603 --> 08:34.900
No hoodie, no murder weapon.
Just the usual contraband.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.092
But they did find this screwed
up behind the rubbish bin in H1.

08:38.746 --> 08:40.696
"Ruby's the killer."

08:41.034 --> 08:43.125
- Something to do with Proctor?
- Doubtful.

08:43.131 --> 08:46.499
CCTV put Mitchell in the
gym when Kaz was killed.

08:46.506 --> 08:48.523
Leave it with me. I'll talk to Will.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.400
You and Miller.

08:55.505 --> 08:57.813
- OK, if you're gonna play it like that.
- Play what like what?

08:57.826 --> 09:00.248
He can't just waltz in
here and take my place.

09:00.815 --> 09:02.529
Your place?

09:02.589 --> 09:04.870
- As the baby's father.
- Oh, for God's sake.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.358
I have parental rights, Vera.

09:06.363 --> 09:07.861
- You can't just shut me out.
- That's enough, Jake.

09:07.885 --> 09:08.895
I'll take legal action

09:08.912 --> 09:10.442
- to protect those rights if I have to.
- Can you get out?

09:10.465 --> 09:12.840
- I mean it.
- So do I. Get out. Now.

09:36.821 --> 09:37.954
Hey, Boomer.

09:38.079 --> 09:39.114
Hey.

09:39.547 --> 09:40.739
- Hey.
- What?

09:40.804 --> 09:43.109
I got me day release, tomorrow.

09:43.244 --> 09:47.410
- Oh, wow! Well, that's... that's exciting. Yeah.
- Mmm.

09:47.443 --> 09:49.294
Yeah. Yeah.

09:49.553 --> 09:52.274
- Mum's me sponsor for the day.
- May.

09:52.399 --> 09:54.772
- Your mum's name's May.
- Yep. Yeah. It is, yep.

09:54.799 --> 09:56.370
Aw.

09:57.395 --> 09:58.609
Hey, Boomer?

09:58.636 --> 10:00.374
- Yep.
- Look at me.

10:01.599 --> 10:04.006
You've been in here a long time,

10:04.131 --> 10:06.235
so maybe she's changed.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.383
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, love.

10:08.394 --> 10:09.760
- Jenkins.
- Yeah.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.409
- Two Psuldrycin?
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.638
- These things make me so horny, eh?
- Do they?

10:14.654 --> 10:16.516
Or maybe it's just
thinking about Dr Greg.

10:16.537 --> 10:18.917
- Ahh, yeah, Dr Greg.
- Mmm.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.649
- Birdsworth.
- Yeah.

10:20.682 --> 10:22.927
- One Psuldrycin.
- Thank you.

10:23.715 --> 10:25.318
Liz is on Miller's program?

10:25.443 --> 10:27.175
It helps with her dementia.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.716
Bit of a rocky start, but
we're good now, aren't we, Liz?

10:29.759 --> 10:30.941
- Mm-hm, yep.
- Yep.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.084
- Rocky how?
- Psychotic episode.

10:33.127 --> 10:35.583
- But we're all good now, right, Liz?
- Yeah.

10:35.708 --> 10:36.970
You just said that.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.766
- No flies on you.
- I think you need the medication.

10:41.294 --> 10:42.930
She might need it.

11:06.889 --> 11:08.686
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Yeah, come in.

11:10.316 --> 11:11.759
Thank you, Ms Miles.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.269
Deputy Governor.

11:13.668 --> 11:15.271
Yeah.

11:17.732 --> 11:19.951
Well, it seems like a lot can
change very quickly in here.

11:19.968 --> 11:21.554
The women needed stability.

11:21.559 --> 11:25.121
If I can provide it, I wasn't
about to shirk that responsibility.

11:25.343 --> 11:27.059
Oh, the reluctant Top Dog.

11:27.113 --> 11:30.502
- Doesn't quite fit with Kosta's accusation.
- PA: Attention, Compound.

11:30.540 --> 11:31.908
The count will commence in ten minutes.

11:31.932 --> 11:34.301
Her slotting bought
you the time you needed.

11:34.344 --> 11:37.874
Oh, you have a very
devious mind, Ms Bennett.

11:37.999 --> 11:39.693
You know what? This is devious.

11:39.957 --> 11:43.606
A note that was conveniently
found during the ramp.

11:44.367 --> 11:46.888
Another attempt to point
the finger away from you.

11:46.899 --> 11:48.172
_

11:48.242 --> 11:51.626
It won't work forever, Winter.
You will never replace Kaz.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.663
I didn't kill Kaz Proctor.

11:55.723 --> 11:57.191
At the very least,

11:57.202 --> 11:59.652
you'll be charged with
obstructing a police investigation.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.438
I didn't write that note.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.169
Yeah, maybe not.

12:04.239 --> 12:05.859
I'm betting you know who did.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.636
- Count's in five. I've got H3.
- Great.

12:15.989 --> 12:18.623
If you need anything,
you just let me know.

(DOOR OPENS)

12:41.830 --> 12:44.101
Hey, you wanna come
and watch some telly?

12:44.102 --> 12:46.223
Come in. Shut the door, will you?

12:48.296 --> 12:50.689
- What's up?
- Sit down.

12:53.533 --> 12:55.924
You're freaking me out,
Marie. What's going on?

12:55.946 --> 12:57.900
I was shown a note today.

12:58.025 --> 13:00.134
It was written by Drago. I...

13:01.078 --> 13:03.075
Well, I recognised the handwriting.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.646
Right.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.167
So what did it say?

13:09.050 --> 13:10.879
Marie, what did the note say?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.551
"Ruby is the killer."

13:14.064 --> 13:15.451
Killer?

13:16.028 --> 13:19.962
- W... what does that mean?
- Ruby killed Danny.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.720
She murdered my boy.

13:35.196 --> 13:37.079
- Let me talk to her.
- Why?

13:37.511 --> 13:39.368
Drago hated Ruby.

13:39.422 --> 13:41.089
Maybe she was trying to frame her.

13:41.094 --> 13:43.804
Oh, Ruby was at the bar, yeah?
And she's a fuckin' boxer.

13:43.831 --> 13:45.604
Danny was punched in
the head. It all adds up.

13:45.628 --> 13:48.499
Rita killed Drago to shut her
up. You know it and I know it.

13:48.516 --> 13:50.969
- Please don't do anything yet...
- Fuck, this is Danny we're talking about!

13:50.993 --> 13:52.703
Yes, I know... He loved
you and you loved him!

13:52.709 --> 13:53.837
- Yes, I...
- All right, what?

13:53.859 --> 13:55.799
- You wanna protect the bitch who murdered him?
- No, I want...

13:55.823 --> 13:58.980
I want to stop you from doing
something that you might regret.

13:59.061 --> 14:00.275
Winter?

14:00.837 --> 14:02.504
Police are here to question you.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.134
Again?

14:04.814 --> 14:07.178
They're questioning everyone again.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.382
- Do I go? Yep.
- Mm-hm.

14:35.318 --> 14:37.486
- Come on, come on!
- Hi, Mum.

14:37.529 --> 14:39.278
The car shat itself.
I had to get it jumped.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.447
Mrs Jenkins, I need
you to sign this form.

14:41.463 --> 14:44.135
It states you understand
your obligations as a sponsor.

14:44.146 --> 14:46.293
That includes returning your
daughter to this facility

14:46.326 --> 14:48.328
no later than 5pm today.

14:48.377 --> 14:50.189
What? I gotta keep her that long?

14:50.438 --> 14:52.953
Oh, I'm gonna have her back by 4:30.

14:56.709 --> 14:58.080
Good luck.

For God's sake, what
have they been feeding ya?

15:10.402 --> 15:13.256
Yeah. Oh.

15:13.257 --> 15:15.167
- Put the seat back.
- Yeah, I'm trying.

15:15.221 --> 15:17.386
- Put the.. put it back. Back, back.
- Don't... where do I...

15:17.407 --> 15:19.205
- The lever!

- Don't wanna break the fuckin' law, eh?
- Oh, yeah, no.

15:38.282 --> 15:39.787
Hey, um, where's Trina?

15:39.841 --> 15:41.741
Oh, she's down the coast with Daz.

15:41.866 --> 15:43.916
She's havin' a rootin' on the beach.

15:44.607 --> 15:45.795
Oh.

15:45.832 --> 15:47.916
I didn't think you had your licence, eh?

15:47.997 --> 15:49.956
- I don't.
- Oh.

15:58.506 --> 16:00.169
Did you kill Danny Winter?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.023
What?

16:03.062 --> 16:05.363
- Why would you say something like that?
- Drago...

16:05.402 --> 16:07.328
wrote a note saying that you did.

16:07.453 --> 16:10.535
Some time before your
sister bashed her to death.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.566
It said, "Ruby is the killer."

16:14.800 --> 16:16.540
Drago hated me.

16:17.340 --> 16:19.334
She had it in for me and Rita.

16:28.350 --> 16:29.667
Show me.

16:32.282 --> 16:33.750
No.

16:38.132 --> 16:40.171
- Show me.
- Fuck off, Allie.

16:40.182 --> 16:42.935
- Prove to me that it wasn't you...
- Why the fuck should I?

16:46.967 --> 16:48.489
Oh, shit.

- You don't know?

Liz's psychotic episodes

21:38.725 --> 21:40.365
after she started taking the drug.

Why?

21:42.280 --> 21:44.661
My research is experimental.

as an excuse to shut me down.

- Nothing, I'm just...
- I fudged a report.

It probably constitutes medical fraud.

- It's foetal alcohol symptom!

- It's syndrome!

there was a note that was found in H1,

25:28.723 --> 25:31.864
written on one of these, and it said,

25:31.913 --> 25:33.753
"Ruby's the killer."

25:35.160 --> 25:39.301
What, so you think Ruby killed Kaz?

25:39.349 --> 25:44.482
No! No, no, no, there is
no way Ruby is the killer.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.910
- I'm sure you're right, Liz.
- Yeah.

25:45.934 --> 25:47.543
But why would it say that?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.567
"Ruby is the killer."

She kept trying to tell him to fuck off

33:17.817 --> 33:20.684

over at the carpark.

33:22.577 --> 33:24.490

33:25.170 --> 33:27.285

33:28.024 --> 33:30.129
Telling me she was begging for it.

- She wasn't complaining.
- That it was the best fuck she'd ever had.

And then he said he was
gonna do it to me, too.

41:44.747 --> 41:47.067
Ew, check out the newbie!

41:47.080 --> 41:50.020
- Who's the old bag, Booms?
- Shut ya fuckin' mouth!

41:50.446 --> 41:52.049
Just ignore 'em.

41:52.292 --> 41:54.640
What were you doing in
the Franger lock-up, Booms?

41:54.840 --> 41:58.494
Uh, ask her. This is me mum.

41:58.560 --> 42:01.467
Oh, wow. G'day, May. I'm Liz.

42:01.494 --> 42:03.238
- Oh, hi, Liz.
- Hi.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.315
Yeah, we got done for
stealing baby powder.

42:06.319 --> 42:07.555
- You what?
- Formula.

42:07.588 --> 42:09.855
Who's the wrinkly snatch, Boomy?

42:10.454 --> 42:13.006
I said fuckin' shut it!

42:14.124 --> 42:16.207
She's a klepto with, you know,

42:16.245 --> 42:18.474
- previous convictions.
- I'm not a klepto!

42:18.701 --> 42:21.653
I was allegedly in
receipt of stolen goods.

42:21.863 --> 42:24.049
Come on, let's grab breakfast.

42:24.994 --> 42:27.595
- Don't they bring it to ya?
- No.

42:47.676 --> 42:49.902
Roo, you OK?

42:50.293 --> 42:54.064
Yeah, I just feel a bit spacey.
I think I've got a fit coming on.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.276
Ms Miles, Ruby needs to go to Medical.

42:56.317 --> 42:58.846
- What for?
- Epileptic seizure. She's having one.

42:58.862 --> 43:00.244
Shit, let's go.

43:00.271 --> 43:02.235
- No, Reet, it's not...
- Come on, come on.

43:33.692 --> 43:36.424
I just... I just wanna sleep.

43:36.549 --> 43:38.178
How'd this happen?

43:38.303 --> 43:41.882
Oh, it was an accident.
Just on a bit of fence wire.

43:42.968 --> 43:45.876
- This will need stitches.
- OK.

43:48.551 --> 43:51.200
How is she? Still prodromal?

43:51.320 --> 43:53.300
I'm not convinced it's her epilepsy.

43:53.322 --> 43:55.410
- Could be drug-related.
- OK.

44:02.156 --> 44:03.879
Have you seen Marie?

44:03.880 --> 44:07.158
Yeah. Medical. Fuckin'
bitch slashed herself.

44:07.423 --> 44:08.815
What?

44:20.000 --> 44:21.632
Oh, shit!

44:28.405 --> 44:30.251
- (GROAN)
- How's the pain?

44:30.283 --> 44:32.194
Oh, it's not good.

44:32.240 --> 44:35.147
- OK, I'll get you some relief.
- Thanks.

44:41.482 --> 44:44.623
Now you know how my
Danny felt at the end.

44:47.705 --> 44:49.238
Winter?

44:53.826 --> 44:56.119
This was found in a search of your cell.

44:56.492 --> 44:58.127
Care to explain it?

44:59.363 --> 45:01.236
Right, slot her.

45:15.488 --> 45:18.257
I'm still his mother!

45:18.760 --> 45:22.099
Do you get that? I'm still his mother!

45:24.031 --> 45:26.632
He's still my son!

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Fuck you all!

45:33.160 --> 45:34.576
- You gotta let me out.
- Marie.

45:34.593 --> 45:35.856
I need to get back to Medical.

45:35.898 --> 45:37.490
Nurse Shen said she treated your arm.

45:37.501 --> 45:39.174
Come on, you can release me.

45:39.206 --> 45:41.598
- Drugs were found in your cell.
- Fuck it,

45:41.603 --> 45:43.204
you know what I've been going
through. You gotta let me out.

45:43.228 --> 45:44.966
- I can't.
- You can!

45:44.977 --> 45:46.472
You're the fucking Governor!

45:46.499 --> 45:49.429
You can let me out!

45:49.488 --> 45:53.110
You gotta help me. Help me!

46:08.157 --> 46:09.582
So, have you got a nine?

46:09.636 --> 46:11.077
- I do.
- Ooh, good one.

46:11.099 --> 46:12.670
What are you looking at?

46:13.317 --> 46:15.088
- Hey, we're back.
- Hey.

46:15.109 --> 46:16.680

- Um,

46:17.079 --> 46:18.835

46:19.374 --> 46:22.606
Um, you gotta be standing
by your door for the count.

46:22.623 --> 46:25.133
- Why?
- 'Cos... 'Cos you just do.

46:25.197 --> 46:27.698
Well, you might be happy being a
sheep, Susie, but I'm bloody not.

46:27.722 --> 46:29.959
- It's just so they can count ya, love.
- Yeah.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.641
Hey, look who's here.

46:31.651 --> 46:32.758
- Hey.
- Ruby Do!

46:32.779 --> 46:35.726
- How're you?
- No, it's just a false alarm. But I feel better.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.405
- You don't look it.
- I'm fine.

46:37.432 --> 46:39.370
- I just have a headache and a dry mouth.
- Oh?

46:39.418 --> 46:40.681
Poor little mouse.

46:40.703 --> 46:43.412
You can keep your doors open
or shut. Doesn't really matter.

46:43.445 --> 46:46.575
- Yeah, usually, we keep 'em open.
- Yeah, I like my privacy, so...

46:46.600 --> 46:48.279
Right. Um...

46:48.280 --> 46:50.856
Yeah, don't borrow anyone's stuff.

46:50.981 --> 46:52.767
Especially mine.

46:53.031 --> 46:55.120
And try not to steal
anything, ya klepto.

46:55.152 --> 46:58.175
- Yeah, so what's with all the bloody rules here?
- You're in prison, love.

47:09.632 --> 47:12.961
Yeah, so, whatever you do, that button?

47:12.988 --> 47:14.683
Don't ever press it, all right?

47:14.742 --> 47:16.291
- (ALARM)
- Oh, shit.

47:16.307 --> 47:18.639
What the fuck did you do that for?

47:20.160 --> 47:22.160
(ALARM CONTINUES)

47:24.802 --> 47:28.067

47:28.240 --> 47:30.934

47:51.881 --> 47:53.635
Her condition's critical.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.302
Operation is very risky.

47:55.319 --> 47:57.234
I need to be with my
sister, please, Ms Bennett.

47:57.261 --> 47:58.932
It's Mr Jackson's decision.
