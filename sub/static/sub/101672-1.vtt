03:39.943 --> 03:41.324
- Welcome to
Celebrities Uncovered.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.568
I'm your host, Lisa Carmel.

03:43.602 --> 03:46.881
Today, we're joined by
the lovely Faye Dayne,

03:46.916 --> 03:48.607
star of the film "Fog Storm"

03:48.642 --> 03:52.335
which opens nationwide
in theaters this Friday.

03:52.370 --> 03:55.165
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.376
I know you were headed to a
special needs charity event.

03:58.410 --> 04:01.137
We really appreciate you
welcoming us into your home.

04:01.171 --> 04:02.725
- [Faye] Its my pleasure.

04:03.898 --> 04:06.660
- So, yesterday we
interviewed Cage

04:06.694 --> 04:08.869
regarding his role
in "Fog Storm".

04:08.903 --> 04:11.112
Tell us a little bit
about your character.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.324
- Megan is tough,
she goes through hell

04:15.358 --> 04:18.706
but I love the fact
that she never gives up.

04:18.741 --> 04:20.605
She always keeps fighting.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.470
- [Lisa] You seem
to have it all.

04:23.504 --> 04:25.575
A career that's skyrocketing,

04:25.610 --> 04:27.888
a house in the Hollywood hills.

04:27.922 --> 04:29.234
- Isn't it beautiful?

04:29.269 --> 04:32.133
You should see the
sunset, it's amazing.

04:32.168 --> 04:34.446
It's probably my favorite
part of living here.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.105
- [Lisa] What's next for you?

04:38.139 --> 04:41.315
- Well um, actually I'm
taking the next few weeks off.

04:41.350 --> 04:43.869
My first real vacation in years.

04:45.561 --> 04:46.976
- [Lisa] And where you gonna go?

04:47.010 --> 04:49.875
You got a boyfriend to
take along with you?

04:49.910 --> 04:53.051
Milan, Paris?

04:53.085 --> 04:55.605
- Actually I plan on
staying home and relaxing.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.607
I never get to do that.

04:57.642 --> 04:58.505
[Faye sobbing]

04:58.539 --> 05:00.438
Maybe get laser surgery.

05:01.887 --> 05:04.752
I'm so sick of wearing these
stupid contacts all the time.

05:04.787 --> 05:06.375
- [Lisa] Well whatever
you decide to do,

05:06.409 --> 05:07.479
enjoy your time off.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.240
All the buzz is that you've got

05:10.275 --> 05:12.346
a really big hit on your hands.

05:12.381 --> 05:14.348
All the early reviews
say this is gonna

05:14.383 --> 05:16.557
be your best film yet.

05:16.592 --> 05:18.594
- [Faye] Thank you,
so great to hear.

05:19.629 --> 05:21.113
- Naturally.

05:21.148 --> 05:22.183
Any last words?

05:23.737 --> 05:26.464
- Go see "Fog Storm"
it's a lot of fun.

05:26.498 --> 05:29.674

- I think I've got
like a bug in my ear,

06:54.897 --> 06:58.348
like a gnat flew in my
ear and its like in there

06:58.383 --> 07:01.800
and I, you know, I can't reach
for it, I can't get it out.

07:01.835 --> 07:03.906
All these plants.

07:03.940 --> 07:06.529
God damn, its like an
Amazonian jungle here

07:06.564 --> 07:08.773
now I got hair in my mouth.

07:08.807 --> 07:11.016
My girlfriend took me to
this Italian restaurant.

07:11.051 --> 07:12.880
She said, "There's a guy here."

07:12.915 --> 07:14.364
She's sighted.

07:14.399 --> 07:15.642
"Guy here, he's got a lot
of hair in his ear's."

07:15.676 --> 07:18.092
Do you think I'm
growing hair in my ears?

07:18.127 --> 07:19.473
Women don't get the
hair in the ears.

07:19.508 --> 07:21.164
Do they?

07:21.199 --> 07:22.614
Are we here?

07:22.649 --> 07:25.203
Its flat, are we here?

08:52.462 --> 08:53.498

08:53.533 --> 08:56.018
- [Sophia] Yeah, I'm going in.

08:58.883 --> 09:00.401
- [Luke] I'll be back in an hour

09:00.436 --> 09:01.713
for the group meeting.

09:01.748 --> 09:03.612
I'll see you soon.

09:03.646 --> 09:05.406
- Okay, bye.

09:15.900 --> 09:19.248
[soft melancholy music]

09:27.670 --> 09:29.223
Here you go, Sophia.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.573
- Thank you.

09:39.889 --> 09:41.477
Not, sorry [laughs].

09:43.030 --> 09:43.859
- Its good for you.

09:43.893 --> 09:45.930
- Exactly. [laughs]

09:51.729 --> 09:52.592
You're thinking.

09:56.872 --> 09:59.840
- Think Luke will be upset if
I cancel hosting the meeting?

10:01.428 --> 10:03.844
- I don't think
he'll say anything.

10:03.879 --> 10:05.294
- Can you be serious
for a moment?

10:05.328 --> 10:06.778
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

10:06.813 --> 10:10.782
Look, I, I know that
you're nervous, okay,

10:10.817 --> 10:12.991
you still have so many
memories of your old life.

10:13.026 --> 10:16.719
I don't have that problem,
I was born this way.

10:18.341 --> 10:20.412
You want your old
life back, I get it.

10:22.863 --> 10:24.347
- I can't help it.

10:24.382 --> 10:26.971
- But it keeps you from
embracing your new life.

10:29.145 --> 10:30.215
- I don't have a new life.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.113
- But you could.

10:32.562 --> 10:34.806
In case you haven't noticed,
Luke's got the hots for you.

10:36.566 --> 10:38.258
- No he doesn't.

10:38.292 --> 10:40.260
- Does he have to
spell it out for you?

10:41.710 --> 10:42.538
- Really?

10:43.815 --> 10:45.541
- Okay, that was an accident.

10:45.575 --> 10:47.647
[laughs]

10:50.132 --> 10:51.478
- How would that even work?

10:52.617 --> 10:54.205
A blind girl and a mute guy.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.140
- Not gonna know
unless you take a leap.

10:59.382 --> 11:00.901
Got to take that first step.

11:04.318 --> 11:07.632
[low suspenseful music]

11:31.552 --> 11:35.660
- [Luke] We have a new
member to our group today.

11:37.179 --> 11:38.870
Everyone welcome Lydia.

11:39.802 --> 11:41.977
- Hi, Lydia.
- Hey, Lydia.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.015
- [Luke] Lydia, would
you like to share

11:46.050 --> 11:47.465
your story with us?

11:48.846 --> 11:50.882
- I was in a car accident.

11:50.917 --> 11:53.678
The man that was driving
the car that hit me

11:53.713 --> 11:54.714
was intoxicated.

11:57.613 --> 12:00.547
I can't remember what
he looks like anymore.

12:00.581 --> 12:02.100
Funny how that fades with time.

12:03.550 --> 12:06.242
But I can still smell his
breath if I think hard enough.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.005
The stench of bourbon
and cigarettes.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.009
I hit my head on
the steering wheel.

12:14.043 --> 12:16.287
I'm not sure why the
air bag didn't inflate.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.566
A mechanic checked
it after the accident

12:19.600 --> 12:21.879
and it was in perfect
working order.

12:21.913 --> 12:23.639
Just one of those
things, I guess.

12:25.158 --> 12:27.781
I ended up with
cerebral hemorrhage.

12:27.816 --> 12:31.405
At first, I could see a little
but everything was hazy.

12:33.994 --> 12:35.927
What I wouldn't give
to have that back.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.587
A week later, I lost
my vision completely.

12:42.658 --> 12:44.902
I was left in darkness
while the man that hit me

12:44.936 --> 12:46.835
he got away without a scratch.

12:48.284 --> 12:50.908
But hey I can now smell a
donut shop from a mile away

12:50.942 --> 12:54.187
so that's that.
[laughter]

12:58.225 --> 12:59.640
- [Luke] Losing one sense

12:59.675 --> 13:03.437
will lead your remaining
senses to heightened awareness.

13:03.472 --> 13:04.818
- Bullshit.

13:04.853 --> 13:06.509
[melancholy music]

13:06.544 --> 13:07.890
- [Luke] You'll
notice that your sense

13:07.925 --> 13:09.547
of hearing will improve.

13:11.445 --> 13:14.863
Your sense of taste,
your sense of smell.

13:14.897 --> 13:18.487
You'll begin to navigate
your environment much better.

13:19.729 --> 13:20.558
Look at Faye.

13:21.697 --> 13:23.872
Today she went on a
hike for the first time

13:23.906 --> 13:25.425
since she lost her vision.

13:29.015 --> 13:31.224
Did you ever think you
would do that again?

13:33.985 --> 13:34.814
- No.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.094
- But you did.

13:39.128 --> 13:41.337
All of you are not disabled.

13:42.338 --> 13:44.271
You must remember that.

13:44.306 --> 13:46.895
You are not handicapped.

13:46.929 --> 13:48.758
They are simply labels.

13:48.793 --> 13:52.452
You are all so strong,
stronger than you know.

13:53.729 --> 13:56.663
You can push the body
to remarkable heights

13:58.078 --> 14:00.529
but nothing can compare
to what you can accomplish

14:00.563 --> 14:04.774
with your mind when you
decide to trust your instincts

14:06.466 --> 14:09.331
and focus on bettering yourself.

14:10.780 --> 14:14.750
Its difficult, the most
difficult thing you will do.

14:16.131 --> 14:20.376
You will have many bad days but
then you'll have a good day.

14:21.550 --> 14:24.277
Those good days will
begin to stack up

14:24.311 --> 14:27.901
and before you know it,
you have a good week,

14:27.936 --> 14:32.112
then a good month,
then a good year.

14:33.873 --> 14:38.878
We all struggle but together
we can achieve so much more.

14:41.742 --> 14:42.674
- Bullshit.

14:47.024 --> 14:49.233
- [Sophia] Now that
wasn't so bad, was it?

14:49.267 --> 14:52.201
How did it feel having a
house full of strangers?

14:52.236 --> 14:54.100
- My anxiety level is at a 10.

14:54.134 --> 14:55.135
- You are a 10.

14:55.170 --> 14:57.206
Isn't that right, Luke?

14:57.241 --> 14:58.069
- [Luke] Yes!

14:59.760 --> 15:01.176
- It was quite the day today.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.594
- [Luke] Did you
enjoy your hike?

15:05.628 --> 15:06.457
- Yes.

15:07.837 --> 15:09.046
- [Luke] I'm free tomorrow

15:09.080 --> 15:10.910
if you want to do
another session.

15:12.152 --> 15:13.326
- Sure.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.879
You'll join us,
too, right, Sophia?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.123
- Can't, me and Mark have plans.

15:17.157 --> 15:18.952
[laughs]

15:18.987 --> 15:21.230
- [Mark] We aint got shit.

15:22.645 --> 15:24.337
- Great, so then its a plan.

15:24.371 --> 15:25.614

[phone beeping]

20:09.829 --> 20:11.244
Hi, Sophia.

20:11.279 --> 20:13.315
- Hey, good morning.

20:13.350 --> 20:14.799
You sound tired.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.526
- [Faye] I didn't
sleep well last night.

20:17.561 --> 20:18.389
- Neither did I.

20:20.598 --> 20:23.291
- I'm calling to let you know
I have to cancel hiking today.

20:24.499 --> 20:26.259
- [Sophia] Is everything okay?

20:26.294 --> 20:27.502
- Yeah, I'm fine.

20:27.536 --> 20:29.573
I just want to stay in.

20:29.607 --> 20:30.781
I was gonna call
Luke to let him know

20:30.815 --> 20:33.991
but I want to let
you know first.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.718
- No need, I'm gonna go anyway.

20:36.752 --> 20:37.891
- [Faye] You are?

20:37.926 --> 20:40.100
- Yeah, I had a
great time yesterday.

20:40.135 --> 20:43.483
- Okay, I'm sorry.

20:43.518 --> 20:44.864
- [Sophia] No worries.

20:44.898 --> 20:46.555
- Bye.

20:46.590 --> 20:49.972
[tense melancholy music]

21:42.542 --> 21:44.958
- [Sophia] You know, a lot
of people are into hiking.

21:44.993 --> 21:46.822
I am not one of those people.

21:49.446 --> 21:50.585
- [Luke] Then why come?

21:51.758 --> 21:54.209
- I'm gonna be brutally
honest with you, okay.

21:54.243 --> 21:58.144
Somebody's gotta help you
and Faye along, you know?

21:58.178 --> 22:02.217
I mean, it's like some cheesy
romantic comedy, you know?

22:02.251 --> 22:04.978
You guys are so sweet
it makes my teeth hurt.

22:05.013 --> 22:06.394
You're into her, aren't you?

22:07.843 --> 22:08.982
Aren't you?

22:10.743 --> 22:12.123
Your turn to be honest.

22:12.158 --> 22:14.160
- [Luke] Yes, I really like her.

22:14.194 --> 22:16.231
- Well she's into you.

22:16.265 --> 22:17.819
What's the problem?

22:19.855 --> 22:21.650
- [Luke] I don't
know how to say it.

22:22.858 --> 22:23.928
- Well--
- Shut up.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.967
- Look, you treat her like
you would treat anyone.

22:28.001 --> 22:31.177
Women like appreciation
and talking

22:31.211 --> 22:34.007
and you know all that stuff.

22:34.042 --> 22:37.079
What you really
need to give to her

22:37.114 --> 22:39.392
is compliment her on her beauty.

22:39.427 --> 22:40.876
She thinks she's lost it.

22:42.050 --> 22:44.293
- [Luke] That is one
of the dumbest things

22:44.328 --> 22:46.054
I have ever heard.

22:46.088 --> 22:46.917
- Tell her that.

22:48.712 --> 22:51.231
- [Luke] She's out of my league.

22:53.302 --> 22:54.131
- Luke.

22:56.098 --> 22:57.445
May I?

22:57.479 --> 22:58.825
