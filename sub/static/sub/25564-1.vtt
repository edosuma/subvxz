WEBVTT

00:05.416 --> 00:06.129
Drop the money!

00:09.053 --> 00:12.654
You know there's no turning back
with this, eh? I'm so OK with that.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.565
Drop the money!

00:14.884 --> 00:16.756
Stop the van!
They're onto us! Over!

00:16.817 --> 00:18.746
Dump the van.

00:20.367 --> 00:22.919
Where's the money, Lefty?
Still in the van.

00:23.004 --> 00:24.919
West Jnr.
Shit.

00:29.953 --> 00:31.537
They got our boy.

00:31.711 --> 00:33.930
What would it take
to end this thing?

00:33.955 --> 00:36.479
The missing van and its
contents, for starters.

00:36.564 --> 00:40.384
I did a deal with McCarthy to get Wolf out.
That didn't happen, did it?

00:40.409 --> 00:43.364
Today having to deal with the Wests.

00:43.988 --> 00:47.295
I want us to start a life
of our own. We're going on holiday.

00:47.452 --> 00:50.323
You don't give a shit! That is my
son that you are talking ab0ut-

00:50.408 --> 00:52.512
And the father of my child!

00:58.106 --> 01:01.099
TAMMY WYNETTE: <i>#</i> Sometimes it's hard

01:01.124 --> 01:05.104
I# to be a woman, <i>I</i>

01:06.864 --> 01:10.255
<i>#</i> giving all your love

01:10.397 --> 01:14.277
<i>#</i> to just one man.

01:16.243 --> 01:20.199
<i>#</i> You'll have bad times,

01:21.010 --> 01:24.911
<i>#</i> and he'll have good times

01:25.568 --> 01:27.973
<i>#</i> doing things that you don't

01:27.998 --> 01:31.906
<i>#</i> understand.

01:34.352 --> 01:38.293
<i>#</i> Stand by your man.

01:38.909 --> 01:42.778

01:43.237 --> 01:47.185
<i>#</i> and something warm to come to

01:47.892 --> 01:51.892
<i>#</i> when nights are cold and lonely. <i>#</i>

01:55.123 --> 01:56.942
Hi.
Hi.

02:04.363 --> 02:06.563
I thought of a name.
Oh yeah'?

02:07.039 --> 02:09.329
Meryl. That actress you like.

02:09.399 --> 02:15.723
She's a real good actor, but Meryl's a shit name. I
was listening to a Tammy VVynette song in the car.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.608
Tammy? Nah, it's not good, is it?
Even worse than Meryl.

02:19.713 --> 02:24.711
Even worse than that last country-singer
chick you suggested. Loretta Lynn.

02:24.874 --> 02:27.205
None of our kids will
ever be called Loretta.

02:27.259 --> 02:31.828
We're having more than one, are we'?
I guess that depends.

02:32.910 --> 02:36.609
You heard they postponed
it again, the hearing'?

02:38.726 --> 02:40.997
There is actually some news.

02:41.635 --> 02:44.024
We know who got the van money.

02:50.061 --> 02:51.980
ls Ngaire here'?
Who?

02:52.034 --> 02:55.863
Ngaire. She used to live here. I just
went to her place on Kunekune Ave,

02:56.037 --> 03:00.800
and the person said that the house had been sold.
So I wondered if maybe she'd moved back here.

03:00.845 --> 03:05.182
No. I live... We live here.

03:05.207 --> 03:09.035
Well this is Ngaire's old house.
She's gone away on holiday.

03:09.060 --> 03:10.899
Is she bitch ex-wife'?

03:11.110 --> 03:14.065
So you know Lefty.
Lefty. Da.

03:14.090 --> 03:15.983
One ball.

03:16.692 --> 03:19.861
So is Lefty here?
No, Lefty at his house.

03:19.886 --> 03:24.414
This is Lefty's house.
We rent here. He at his other house.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.551
Lefty has another house'?

03:28.003 --> 03:30.670
You stole our money and bought
a house with it, you bastard.

03:34.324 --> 03:38.225
You've got it wrong_ I bought this place before the
van job_ And I've got the paperwork to prove it_

03:38.250 --> 03:39.965
Then how come you didn't
tell us about it, eh'?

03:39.990 --> 03:42.383
Cos I knew you'd get the wrong idea
and shit like this would happen.

03:42.445 --> 03:45.726
What wrong idea'?
And why would shit like this happen'?

03:45.796 --> 03:49.663
Because I bought it with
the South African money.

03:49.822 --> 03:53.066
You did steal our
money, you bastard. Ow!

03:53.246 --> 03:57.744
Argh! With my share, before
I got conned out of the rest!

03:57.806 --> 04:01.306
Ted went travelling; Bert bought his flash car; you
bought a house too, didn't you, Phineas? Didn't ya?

04:07.108 --> 04:09.063
Yeah, I guess that's true.

04:11.178 --> 04:15.590
- So Lefty hasn't got the money? WHISPERS:
No. - Then who the fuck has?

04:15.816 --> 04:18.358
How does Ngaire feel about Russian
hookers living in her house'?

04:18.500 --> 04:21.649
Like I give a fuck. I get this
call in the middle of the night.

04:21.732 --> 04:24.452
Ngaire tells rne that her and Mr Piggy
aren't coming back from holiday,

04:24.552 --> 04:27.368
that they've moved to bloody Queensland.
I go 'They're my kids too,

04:27.525 --> 04:31.085
'and I don't want them growing up Australian'.
I have rights when it comes to that stuff.

04:31.110 --> 04:34.461
Why are they living in Queensland? Apparently,
he got a job with the pigs over there,

04:34.618 --> 04:39.050
too good to turn down. So they've
buggered off, taking my kids with him,

04:39.075 --> 04:42.472
so he can be one of
Joh Bjelke-Petersen's bootboys.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.560
Fuck. Fuck.

04:45.136 --> 04:47.284
WHISPERS: McCarthy took the money.

04:47.309 --> 04:50.278
He can't do that - he's a cop.
I led him straight to it.

04:50.303 --> 04:53.006
No, you weren't to
know that he'd turn.

04:53.184 --> 04:55.750
You know what this means, right'?

04:55.783 --> 04:59.936
They're not gonna go after McCarthy,
not in a million years.

05:00.146 --> 05:01.986
So I am fucked.

05:03.623 --> 05:05.998
I am totally fucked.

05:13.976 --> 05:16.695
McCarthy.
Hello, Mike.

05:16.838 --> 05:21.028
Jeez, is that Ted bloody West?
How's it going, mate'?

05:21.055 --> 05:22.922
Pretty bloody sudden,
wasn't it'? Upping tent.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.408
True. But you can thank
your wife for that -

05:25.469 --> 05:29.542
teaching me that when life dumps a great big opportunity
in your lap, you'd be a mug t0 let it go by.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.909
Yeah, well, pity about the
shit you left behind, eh'?

05:32.036 --> 05:37.174
None of it of my making, Ted. It had hit
the fan long before I made my choice.

05:37.199 --> 05:42.107
All I did was tunnel through it to the
other side. You ever been to Queensland?

05:42.132 --> 05:45.165
No, can't say I have. They play
by different rules over here.

05:45.339 --> 05:49.040
You wouldn't last two minutes. Just in case
you and the boys were thinking of visiting.

05:49.219 --> 05:51.934
No, no, no. We're more looking forward
to catching up when you come back.

05:52.093 --> 05:54.593
Declan Cork - you know Declan's
my boy's lawyer, right'?

05:54.618 --> 05:56.890
Dodgy Declan? Yep.
Yeah, well,

05:56.915 --> 05:59.997
you're on his list of witnesses
to appear at the committal hearing.

06:00.022 --> 06:05.129
If it ever bloody happens. I hear it's been delayed
again. Jeez, when I left, VV0lf was toast.

06:05.176 --> 06:07.526
It makes a man wonder why they
haven't gone full steam ahead.

06:07.668 --> 06:11.020
Maybe it's cos they know there's some
dodgy goings-on amongst police staff.

06:11.045 --> 06:17.185
No, that's not it. And before you decide
to open your mouth, there's no proof of anything.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.243
Are you sure about that, Mike'?
Maybe if they knew where to look.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.154
If they start looking, Ted,

06:22.297 --> 06:25.400
don't you think there's a risk they'll learn
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

06:25.504 --> 06:28.523
Yeah, well, maybe you, rne and the boys
can chat about that when you're back.

06:28.548 --> 06:33.354
Ted, you know despite the fact you're a dodgy
bastard, I do actually like you, right?

06:33.425 --> 06:35.920
There are even aspects
of Rita I admire.

06:35.982 --> 06:39.015
Yeah, that's very big of you
But if you lot play this right,

06:39.040 --> 06:43.822
there's absolutely no way Wolf
will go down forthis crime.

06:44.902 --> 06:46.830
That's a big call, Mike.

06:46.860 --> 06:50.288
You like blues music, Ted? Not
really_ VVell, you should do.

06:50.446 --> 06:52.398
It's where rock 'n' roll was born.

06:52.443 --> 06:55.182
<i>#</i> I've got the keys to the highway,

06:55.502 --> 06:57.636
<i>#</i> billed out and bound to go.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.184
<i>#</i> I'm gonna leave here running,

07:00.581 --> 07:04.305
<i>#</i> cos walkin' is way too slow. <i>#</i>

07:04.462 --> 07:08.265
You know that song, Ted? Yeah, vaguely.
VVell, keep it in mind.

07:08.348 --> 07:11.740
And after the hearing, if Declan
doesn't miss the painfully obvious,

07:11.903 --> 07:15.097
we'll sit down
and we'll have that beer.

07:23.994 --> 07:29.954
There you go, my love. VVho was that on
the phone? VVork. Nothing important.

07:30.503 --> 07:34.409
The prick's having a laugh at us. Cos the
keys are what got Wolf sent away, right?

07:34.573 --> 07:37.281
Yeah, we got that bit, Lefty, yes.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.739
He seemed almost...

07:41.199 --> 07:44.381
genuine. The man who stole from us?
Yeah, I know. I know.

07:44.524 --> 07:46.959
And if he's so bloody sure that
they'll never convict Wolf,

07:46.984 --> 07:50.046
then why is he still
on remand in fucking prison'?

07:53.265 --> 07:55.077
OK, that's time.

07:57.026 --> 07:58.918
I don't wanna go.

07:59.097 --> 08:00.895
You don't wanna be here.

08:02.238 --> 08:04.072
I love you.

08:05.239 --> 08:07.215
I love you too.

08:08.829 --> 08:15.616
Mum and Dad, the times
that they were inside, they'd never visit.

08:16.427 --> 08:19.217
I never really understood
that until now.

08:19.374 --> 08:23.383
What'? No, Wolf, I need to see you.
And I wanna see you too.

08:23.425 --> 08:28.204
But if this is gonna be us
for the next however many years...

08:30.000 --> 08:36.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:44.593 --> 08:47.159
You boys have been busy.

08:47.184 --> 08:50.651
Three days straight running round
Auckland like Vikings in a van,

08:50.742 --> 08:53.892
pillaging, for you. I'm not
going to ask what fuelled that.

08:54.102 --> 08:55.976
Amphetamines.

08:56.001 --> 09:01.015
As long as you stuck to the rules.
Yeah, pretty much. Absolutely.

09:01.070 --> 09:05.491
We were a crack team, even Falani.
Operation Circle Of Life -

09:05.634 --> 09:11.731
stealing from the houses of lawyers to help pay
for Wolf's legal fees. You see? Circle Of Life.

09:11.756 --> 09:15.000
You only stole from lawyers?
In our minds.

09:17.104 --> 09:23.026
These are beautiful. To go with all the other
beautiful things you've knitted for me.

09:23.071 --> 09:28.269
Well I may not be very good
at some things - like having babies -

09:28.299 --> 09:30.462
but I can knit the
shit out of anything.

09:30.610 --> 09:36.549
You can. Thank you. But Carol, you really
don't have to keep doing it for me.

09:36.574 --> 09:43.681
But I want to. It makes rne feel useful. And
it fills in the time when Phineas isn't there.

09:43.735 --> 09:46.922
Have the boys been out doing,
you know, jobs too'?

09:47.006 --> 09:48.912
No.

09:49.070 --> 09:51.917
Well, Eric and that lot,
they've been gone for days.

09:51.976 --> 09:54.547
Phineas goes for walks to think.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.829
So I knit and think.

09:57.923 --> 10:01.498
Right. Well, at least
you have a friend now.

10:01.572 --> 10:07.663
This is Barry. Phineas brought
him home after one of his walks.

10:08.091 --> 10:12.641
I thought you could name him Barry,
after that singer you like.

10:12.687 --> 10:14.863
Where did you find a dog
in the middle of the night?

10:15.037 --> 10:18.015
There was a man on
the side of the road.

10:18.688 --> 10:23.775
There are people by the side of the road who
give away dogs in the middle of the night?

10:23.954 --> 10:27.042
Phineas lives
in a fairy tale sometimes.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.454
Barry? After Barry Manilow. You
know, the one who writes the songs.

10:32.663 --> 10:35.685
Yeah, you like Barry Manilow?
Not really.

10:35.880 --> 10:41.465
Yeah, well, Barry the dog may not live for long
when Rita sees what he's just done on her floor.

10:41.490 --> 10:43.712
Oh, for fuck's sake, Barry!

10:45.768 --> 10:52.537
Someone told rne that when women can't have
babies, it's good to have a pet instead.

10:53.818 --> 10:57.463
I think she
really loves him, eh.

10:58.902 --> 11:04.539
But it's real hard to tell with women, cos they
cry when they're happy and when they're sad.

11:04.729 --> 11:08.205
It's hard to tell, yes.
Mr Ted, you are here.

11:09.098 --> 11:11.251
Yo, Dad.

11:13.091 --> 11:15.070
Ofisa. Long time, no see.

11:15.399 --> 11:17.803
It has been indeed, Theodore.

11:17.947 --> 11:19.736
Ofisa_
Officer who?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.633
No, Falani's father's name is Ofisa.

11:23.686 --> 11:26.307
My father wishes to thank you
in person for all the help.

11:26.466 --> 11:28.374
On behalf of the church.

11:28.421 --> 11:34.663
And them too, for all the help and keeping me on
the path of the righteous <i>as</i> your apprentice.

11:34.889 --> 11:42.760
Everybody's so proud of Falani spending time working
to learn the fine art that is l0cksmithing_

11:45.261 --> 11:48.537
Yes. Yes, I'm sure Falani
will make a very fine locksmith.

11:48.746 --> 11:53.821
And the old ladies at church, when they lose their
keys, they can turn to him in their hour of need.

11:53.937 --> 11:55.801
Ah. Amen to that.

11:57.689 --> 12:01.613
Do you read the paper, Theodore'?
No, Best Bets is more my speed.

12:01.808 --> 12:08.094
There's a story in the paper - a group of
young men roving the city, stealing at will.

12:08.199 --> 12:12.208
And I look at that face - although
the young man's obviously Tongan -

12:12.402 --> 12:18.062
I cannot help but think that there but
for the grace of Ted goes my Falani.

12:18.087 --> 12:24.333
OK, Dad. That's enough. Me and Ted have business
to do as his apprentice in the business.

12:24.416 --> 12:27.186
Well, I've said my piece. I'll go.

12:27.219 --> 12:33.163
You have a very special son. Yeah, we're
very proud of him. Don't muck it up eh.

12:33.576 --> 12:36.468
They've done it again.
Oh, you are fucking kidding me.

12:36.569 --> 12:38.779
Sorry Rita, but no.
They've asked for another delay.

12:38.895 --> 12:41.683
And what fucking excuse this time'?
Oh, same old, you know -

12:41.894 --> 12:43.774
time to gather evidence,
witnesses, whatever.

12:43.824 --> 12:46.068
God, it's such bullshit.
Guess what Ted'?

12:46.227 --> 12:47.545
Again?
Yep

12:47.575 --> 12:49.849
Can they do that,
just leave Wolf in there'?

12:50.043 --> 12:55.276
Well, that's the thing - this time,
there's an offer on the table.

12:55.301 --> 13:00.041
He pleads guilty, they drop the charge
from aggravated robbery to robbery,

13:00.102 --> 13:03.030
cos apparently they accept that Wolf wasn't
the one who was waving the gun around.

13:03.055 --> 13:07.827
That's still 10 years. Yeah, they petition the
judge, and then due to his youth, blah, blah,

13:07.852 --> 13:11.244
blah. They're talking two years.
With time already served,

13:11.289 --> 13:14.730
if he behaves,
he'll be out in nine months.

13:14.755 --> 13:18.261
If I may advocate for the Devil,
that seems a very generous deal.

13:18.315 --> 13:23.328
Yes. Yeah, it does. Who does he
have to give up? No conditions.

13:23.849 --> 13:28.602
You won't ever get a better offer -
I can assure you of that.

13:30.846 --> 13:33.557
Nine months is nada. I'd take it.

13:33.582 --> 13:35.232
Nine months is the time
it takes to make a baby.

13:35.289 --> 13:36.866
Yeah, and he'd miss out
on the birth of this one.

13:37.024 --> 13:40.740
And all of the early nappy changing and the
pooing in the middle of the night. It's a bonus.

13:40.914 --> 13:42.768
What about what evil McCarthy said'?

13:42.942 --> 13:46.003
Ted'? He's your mate.
Not my mate.

13:46.130 --> 13:48.385
It'd help if we had some
idea what he was on about.

13:48.454 --> 13:51.746
What if someone anonymously tipped
the cops off about what he's done'?

13:51.821 --> 13:54.698
Even if they believed it, proving
it puts us in the firing line.

13:54.744 --> 13:57.917
And going after one of their own -
that's not gonna happen, is it'?

13:57.942 --> 14:02.851
So Wolf should take the deal'?
End of the day, that's up to Wolf.

14:02.897 --> 14:05.046
I'll get it.

14:05.194 --> 14:09.840
OK, we were all here. Ted, we
haven't done anything. True.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.953
I won't stay long.
I just want to ask Cheryl something.

14:16.015 --> 14:17.884
No, come on in.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.999
Hi, love.
Hi.

14:22.812 --> 14:25.815
You know the family will be coming
back for Christmas, right'?

14:25.861 --> 14:26.617
Yeah. Sure.

14:26.733 --> 14:32.417
And, you know, if the baby's been born, they're
asking if they'll be allowed to visit.

14:32.611 --> 14:34.913
It's like Jesus in the manger.

14:35.087 --> 14:39.920
Of course, Mum. I want them all in my life, believe
it or not. You're the one who built the wall.

14:39.945 --> 14:43.681
They're already calling me Grandma Trish.
That's good.

14:43.765 --> 14:48.374
Grandma Rita. Stick to eating, Sparky.

14:48.869 --> 14:50.909
Oh, for fuck's sake.

14:51.784 --> 14:54.153
More neighbours.

14:54.297 --> 15:01.540
Sorry for interrupting. It's just that - and
please don't take this the wrong way, but -

15:01.571 --> 15:03.668
we were robbed yesterday.

15:07.613 --> 15:09.520
So'?
So...

15:09.714 --> 15:14.108
uh, some very valuable and
personal things were taken.

15:14.286 --> 15:19.432
Have you talked to the police?
Yes_ So why are you talking to us?

15:19.493 --> 15:25.034
Well, like I said, there were valuable
personal items in what was taken, and I-

15:25.059 --> 15:29.665
And you think that we took them_ And I
wondered if you might know anything about it -

15:29.692 --> 15:33.995
maybe point us in the direction of where we could
recover these items. For a reward, of course.

15:34.137 --> 15:36.145
I can point you out the fucking
door is what I can do.

15:36.355 --> 15:38.236
Oh, for fuck's sake.
We all know it was you lot.

15:38.409 --> 15:41.001
Someone here took our things. If you've got any
sort of decency, you'll give us our things back!

15:41.062 --> 15:44.551
Take your fucking accusations and get the
fuck out of my house! All right. All right.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.552
I've seen your piece-of-shit
stuff, VVendy_ You're all scum!

15:46.636 --> 15:53.894
I wouldn't touch it with a fucking bargepole,
you uptight bitch! Every single one of you!

15:56.185 --> 15:58.823
Is there ice cream for dessert'?

15:58.904 --> 16:00.851
Yeah.
Nice.

16:02.274 --> 16:07.117
I thought those boys knew the
rule - not in your own backyard.

16:07.144 --> 16:09.027
They just got carried away
wanting to help Wolf.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.630
Yeah, well, have a word.
I will.

16:15.365 --> 16:23.347
What are we gonna do about VVolf - do we take the
deal or believe whatever shit McCarthy's spinning?

16:23.698 --> 16:25.683
I've no idea.

16:25.784 --> 16:27.745
You?

16:28.328 --> 16:30.434
I just want my boy back home.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.612
Oh for fuck's sake, Barry!

16:45.233 --> 16:48.475
Holy mother of God.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.256
This did that'?
Is it possessed, do you think'?

16:52.368 --> 16:54.533
Whatever it is, it has to go.

16:54.579 --> 16:56.642
What?
As cute <i>as</i> Barry is,

16:58.016 --> 17:03.045
if he's gonna destroy our home and leave little
stink bombs everywhere, we can't live like that.

17:03.070 --> 17:08.569
Maybe he needs training. Phineas,
I'm not sure a dog is right for us.

17:08.654 --> 17:13.214
What happens when I'm away on work? Are you
gonna look after him, clean up after him?

17:13.356 --> 17:14.182
Oh, he crapped in my shoe!

17:18.003 --> 17:22.987
I'll take him back.
To the man by the side of the road'?

17:23.048 --> 17:27.356
I've got an address.
It was a lovely thought, Phineas.

17:32.646 --> 17:34.583
Hello, love.

17:43.915 --> 17:46.086
Never been in here before.

17:46.172 --> 17:48.363
No. Anything you're after'?

17:49.581 --> 17:53.592
Why would I'? Everyone knows
it's all flogged goods.

17:53.662 --> 17:54.916
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

17:54.943 --> 18:00.671
Maybe you could ask those poor people
from last night. Mm? She around?

18:00.773 --> 18:02.860
Rita? No.

18:02.906 --> 18:09.407
Good. Might make it easier for me to say what
I need to say without herjumping up and down.

18:09.432 --> 18:11.333
Which is what'?

18:12.024 --> 18:15.946
This man of yours, he's going to go-
His name is Wolf.

18:15.992 --> 18:20.059
He's going to go away, love,
to prison, for a long time.

18:20.284 --> 18:24.911
You know that, do you? Yeah. And the rest of
them, they will all follow him, eventually.

18:24.982 --> 18:30.344
They're all walking down the same road. And
what are you gonna do when that day comes, huh?

18:30.502 --> 18:35.253
Not gonna happen. Say that to poor VVendy
- had all her stuff flogged by them.

18:35.278 --> 18:38.548
So she <i>says.</i> Yeah, it was
bloody them, and you know it.

18:38.789 --> 18:45.215
They're thieves, and thieves get caught.
And they will drag you down with them.

18:45.674 --> 18:51.887
And what are you gonna do then, my girl?
You can't have a baby in prison with you.

18:52.011 --> 18:54.417
Have you thought about that'?
That isn't ever going to happen.

18:54.508 --> 18:59.269
As long as you're around them,
it will, sure as eggs is eggs.

19:00.846 --> 19:07.460
And here's one more thing for nothing - it won't
be me looking after her. I've raised my daughters.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.672
So I will let them...

19:10.846 --> 19:17.183
put your daughter into state care in a foster
home, and when it's your turn to get out,

19:17.377 --> 19:20.877
you can fight them to get her back. And good luck with
that one, because once she's gone, she'll be gone.

19:28.903 --> 19:32.564
Nah. I'm never gonna end
up in that position.

19:32.589 --> 19:38.480
Standing there behind that counter,
in her shop - you are already there.

19:38.596 --> 19:45.126
Cheryl, this is a wake-up call, love. It's
a chance for you t0 do the right thing.

19:45.164 --> 19:47.090
You come home...

19:47.284 --> 19:51.841
back to us, and I will love
that child unconditionally.

19:53.505 --> 19:55.808
You let the Wests go to hell.

20:01.608 --> 20:05.287
You tell your bitch of a mother that
if she lays one hand on my grandchild,

20:05.372 --> 20:11.020
she will lose that fucking hand. What if you're not
around? You've been in prison once already, right?

20:11.163 --> 20:13.520
It's not gonna happen again.
How do you know'?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.889
Every time Ted goes on a job,
you know he might not come back.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.204
And maybe you can live with that,
but I don't know if I can.

20:18.234 --> 20:23.369
Your child is a West. And <i>as</i> such, she will
be protected with every breath in my body.

20:23.527 --> 20:27.467
And Trish fucking Miller
can go to fucking hell!

20:35.219 --> 20:37.219
It's her version of love.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.393
Yeah, a fierce love.

20:41.390 --> 20:45.270
I'm going to see Wolf this afternoon.
I'm not gonna mention any of this.

20:45.428 --> 20:47.337
I need you to do the same.

20:49.330 --> 20:55.495
This is the sort of thing, when a man hears about it,
he wants to jump in there and sort this shit out.

20:55.533 --> 21:00.986
As long as Wolf's inside, he can't do a
damn thing, and that will drive him insane.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.940
Do you get that'?

21:06.857 --> 21:08.875
Good.

21:18.306 --> 21:20.449
Did you do this'?
Oh, again?

21:21.057 --> 21:23.478
I just cleaned up the
last one. Bad dog!

21:23.688 --> 21:26.133
Remind me - when did we get a dog'?

21:26.274 --> 21:29.054
I inherited him today from a client.

21:29.228 --> 21:32.338
Is that usual -
to trade animals for sex'?

21:32.372 --> 21:37.324
No, but he's a nice guy and he was
upset so I couldn't really say no.

21:37.349 --> 21:39.407
I can give him to someone
else if you want.

21:39.491 --> 21:45.291
Nah, it's OK. I like dogs. I had one
once for a week. His name was Muldoon.

21:46.045 --> 21:48.376
I missed him after he ran away.

21:48.565 --> 21:51.246
So, what are we gonna call you, eh'?

21:52.031 --> 21:53.975
I know. How about...

21:54.382 --> 21:56.317
Rocky?
Rocky?

21:56.399 --> 21:58.528
His face looks a bit like
Stallone, don't you think?

21:58.643 --> 22:00.797
If you say so.
So Rocky it is.

22:00.883 --> 22:04.566
Welcome, Rocky,
but do not shit on my floor again,

22:04.740 --> 22:08.885
because it is uncool and the
real Rocky would not do that.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.546
I know. Can't you just, like, shave it
or, like, put on a top or something?

22:12.704 --> 22:14.649
Oi, slag!

22:14.680 --> 22:20.630
VVell, that's rich, coming from
the solo mum with the daddy in prison.

22:20.771 --> 22:22.398
You hear what Mum said
to me about the baby'?

22:22.459 --> 22:27.273
- What, that she doesn't want anything t0 do with it?
- Yeah, I got that dinner-time rant. Thanks heaps

22:27.298 --> 22:29.834
It's not my fault
she's lost the plot.

22:29.859 --> 22:32.938
I thought when you become a grandma you're
meant to go all goo-goo over the baby.

22:32.997 --> 22:36.961
Not Mum. I heard her on the phone
to some government department,

22:37.171 --> 22:42.358
asking what her rights were if she
thought the baby was in danger.

22:42.383 --> 22:47.596
Hey, when you're visiting VVolf in prison,
do you give him a handjob under the table?

22:47.760 --> 22:49.858
Fuck off, Mandy.

22:51.602 --> 22:58.403
But why wouldn't Trish want to look after the
baby if, you know, the worst came to the worst?

22:58.434 --> 23:00.202
Babies are the best
thing in the world.

23:00.412 --> 23:03.862
Carol, you're missing the point -
she threatened my family.

23:04.041 --> 23:07.256
That's not a wise thing to do.
NO, ii isn't.

23:07.311 --> 23:10.446
We were just talking about your mum.
So I guessed.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.819
But you shouldn't worry about it. It seems
like something I should worry about.

23:13.977 --> 23:18.229
If the worst comes to the worst -
not that I'm saying it will -

23:18.272 --> 23:22.911
I'd be happy to look after your
baby for as long as it took.

23:25.832 --> 23:27.738
What?

23:27.823 --> 23:30.908
I was only trying to helpful.
Yep. Yep.

23:56.112 --> 23:57.979
You OK'?

23:58.018 --> 23:59.979
You know how it is.

24:00.048 --> 24:04.363
Your mother sends her love. She sent any
of her special lamingtons to McCarthy yet?

24:04.522 --> 24:06.610
Don't tempt her.

24:07.876 --> 24:10.789
You think I should roll the
dice on McCarthy's bullshit?

24:10.850 --> 24:13.554
Well, you're kinda damned if
you do either way, aren't you'?

24:13.608 --> 24:16.632
Well, at least then
I'd know something.

24:16.757 --> 24:18.647
This, in here,

24:20.473 --> 24:24.954
it's the fucking pointlessness that gets to rne - a
bunch of guys with nothing t0 do, no way of escaping.

24:25.112 --> 24:30.601
It's driving me fucking insane.
I wanna do something just to end it.

24:32.471 --> 24:37.032
Well, I guess that's your
answer right there, isn't it'?

24:37.196 --> 24:39.129
Ladies.

24:39.991 --> 24:44.075
Ted here? No, he's visiting VVOlf, then
going t0 the pub to meet you, apparently.

24:44.157 --> 24:46.414
Yeah, I thought we might sneak
down early for a quick one.

24:46.439 --> 24:50.389
Tough life you guys lead Why
have you got Barry? Barry who?

24:50.547 --> 24:53.669
Barry the dog.
This is Rocky, not Barry.

24:54.003 --> 24:55.982
But he looks exactly like Barry.

24:56.192 --> 24:58.035
Well, I don't know what Barry looks
like, so I can't comment, can I?

24:58.120 --> 25:04.251
He looks exactly like that. Phineas gave
him to me, but we had to give him back.

25:04.409 --> 25:09.197
So, this client, the one you got
him from - tell me about him.

25:11.225 --> 25:15.244
We agreed not to talk about my work.
When I'm here, I'm with you.

25:15.349 --> 25:22.332
Let me take a guess, then. Tall, dark, not the
brightest button on the shirt - sound familiar'?

25:22.407 --> 25:25.136
Yes, I got the dog from Phineas.

25:25.236 --> 25:28.588
The righteous and married Phineas
O'Driscoll is seeing a hooker'?

25:28.746 --> 25:32.083
Plural. He's been with most of the girls
at Danny's over the past few months.

25:32.230 --> 25:35.953
Really? Everybody loves him. Except
it does get a bit weird sometimes.

25:36.096 --> 25:38.741
I knew it. What's he into'? Please
tell me he likes to be spanked.

25:38.824 --> 25:43.592
Sometimes he doesn't do anything,
just sits on the bed and cries.

25:43.617 --> 25:45.579
Is Carol here'?
No.

25:46.737 --> 25:48.596
Good.

25:48.754 --> 25:51.427
Cos we need to talk about this.
Why?

25:51.570 --> 25:55.160
You know why.
I've never seen that dog before.

25:55.206 --> 25:57.992
Phineas, it's the same
dog you gave Carol.

25:58.017 --> 26:00.327
Oh, it looks a bit like that
dog - I'll give you that much.

26:00.361 --> 26:03.861
Phineas, it's the same fucking dog. You gave it to
Theresa, among the other things you've been giving her_

26:09.655 --> 26:13.301
You can't tell Carol.
I'm not gonna tell Carol.

26:13.344 --> 26:15.874
You think I wanna get involved in whatever
the hell's going on in your marriage?

26:15.899 --> 26:18.129
Nothing's going on. Oh, apart from
you seeing hookers on the side.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.882
There is no side,
because nothings going on.

26:20.950 --> 26:22.931
On.
Look...

26:22.957 --> 26:29.348
After we couldn't have a baby, we stopped
doing the thing that gets you the baby,

26:29.526 --> 26:33.465
because every time we did it just
reminded us that we can't have a baby.

26:33.638 --> 26:37.129
That's not good. No, not for a
man, because men have needs.

26:37.154 --> 26:40.437
I know, but you, of all people,
seeing prostitutes?

26:40.476 --> 26:45.759
Well, at first, I just wanked, but there's only so much
you can do to yourself before it just feels wrong.

26:45.784 --> 26:49.949
Does Carol know? Oh, she walked in once.
I just told her I was washing it.

26:50.112 --> 26:52.296
That you're having
sex with prostitutes.

26:52.439 --> 26:56.132
I'm not really having sex with them.
Yes, you are. I'm wearing a condom.

26:56.295 --> 26:58.728
How the hell does you wearing
a condom not make it sex'?

26:58.785 --> 27:03.037
No sperms enter the woman.
But your cock enters the woman!

27:03.110 --> 27:05.676
Just because you're wearing a bag that catches
the white stufi that shoots out the end

27:05.834 --> 27:09.620
doesn't change that fact. You have your definition,
and I have my definition that works for me.

27:09.778 --> 27:11.821
But yours makes no sense!

27:11.853 --> 27:13.980
Are you pissed off because I'm doing
things with your girlfriend'?

27:14.023 --> 27:17.459
Oh, the thing called having sex'?
Answer the question.

27:17.602 --> 27:20.738
OK. I'm not wild it's you...

27:20.763 --> 27:23.707
but I know what
she does for a living.

27:25.887 --> 27:29.963
She told me once that she'd
do me for free if she could.

27:29.990 --> 27:36.137
She did? Well, you know when Theresa
comes too hard, she kind of passes out?

27:36.582 --> 27:41.173
Sure. Absolutely. Yeah, it was
after one of those times.

27:41.257 --> 27:43.521
Is it because you're still
actually in love with Ngaire

27:43.564 --> 27:46.902
that you don't mind your girlfriend
getting it on with heaps of other guys?

27:46.927 --> 27:49.936
Here's your dog, Phineas.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.227
But I told Carol that I gave it back!

27:53.252 --> 27:58.559
Russian girls are up for anything, and if anyone
messes with them, then... bloody hell!

27:58.604 --> 28:03.683
I mean, they escaped from communism, so
they take no prisoners. Hello, Cheryl.

28:03.708 --> 28:06.616
Danny.
You're looking gloriously motherly.

28:06.773 --> 28:08.778
I feel like shit.
Glad you're awake.

28:08.803 --> 28:12.582
Danny and I are running through some Galleria
business that you'll need to be across.

28:12.643 --> 28:18.699
OK. We have two new employees on paper.
They're Danny's girls. He pays us...

28:18.729 --> 28:23.637
Rita takes an exorbitant cut. A fair
cut, and then we pass the rest on t0 them.

28:23.815 --> 28:26.001
You'll need to sort the
books so it looks legit.

28:26.026 --> 28:28.942
But I don't know anything
about that sort of stuff.

28:29.025 --> 28:31.059
You'll pick it up as you go.

28:33.334 --> 28:35.236
Danny Peters.
Hello, Ted.

28:35.395 --> 28:38.145
Hi, love. You guys decide
what to do about McCarthy'?

28:38.319 --> 28:41.266
Death and dismemberrnent - they seem
to be the favoured options right now.

28:41.425 --> 28:43.372
I have no problem so far.

28:48.786 --> 28:50.734
Barry's back.

28:52.109 --> 28:55.704
Carol, I'm not worthy of you.

28:55.789 --> 28:58.383
What'? Phineas, don't be silly.

28:58.408 --> 29:02.253
Please, I'm not worthy of
you, and I know I'm not.

29:02.926 --> 29:09.688
I wanted to give you something that <i>says</i> how much
I love you, and a dog isn't it. I know that now.

29:09.718 --> 29:12.835
Because you want a baby.
And I can't...

29:16.564 --> 29:19.531
But what I can give
you is my blessing.

29:20.177 --> 29:22.087
OK.

29:22.609 --> 29:27.177
If you can find a man who can
give you the baby you want...

29:28.180 --> 29:31.507
I'm cool with that.
Phineas, don't be silly.

29:31.655 --> 29:33.563
I'm serious.

29:33.588 --> 29:35.729
Me and Barry are serious.

29:37.225 --> 29:39.158
We want you to be happy.

29:43.309 --> 29:48.592
Why are you dressed like clowns? We're making
an effort for court. Nup, you're not coming.

29:48.740 --> 29:52.613
But VVolf's our pack leader. I am not
having a bunch of dodgy-looking pricks

29:52.638 --> 29:55.448
sitting in the judge's eyeline while
he's trying to make his decision.

29:55.517 --> 30:02.743
Well, actually, it is a public hearing, so
technically, you can't stop us if we wanna go.

30:04.103 --> 30:07.861
Or we could just stay here and get
things ready for the post-match shindig.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.085
That's a great idea, Eric.

30:12.483 --> 30:14.478
You ready? Right.

30:15.431 --> 30:17.466
Let's get this done.

30:28.732 --> 30:31.907
Cometh the hour, Mr West.

30:33.219 --> 30:38.930
Last chance. Have you thought about
the Crown's most generous offer'?

30:40.382 --> 30:42.322
Yeah.

30:42.885 --> 30:44.858
Do we have a decision?

30:45.997 --> 30:47.928
We do.

30:49.991 --> 30:54.166
Man, I don't know what I hate
more - pigs or bent pigs.

30:55.184 --> 30:57.158
Look at that smug prick.

31:00.550 --> 31:03.577
Well he's his mother's
son, for sure.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.492
No deal'?

31:07.309 --> 31:10.333
Is that the best plan'?
Well, it's the wish of my client.

31:10.460 --> 31:12.559
You're not answering
the question, Declan.

31:12.685 --> 31:17.238
We'll just have to see, won't we? They've brought
in the Crown prosecutor, which is a sign.

31:17.276 --> 31:17.964
Of what'?

31:18.049 --> 31:22.340
Either there's something not quite right with their
case or they just really hate the West family.

31:22.454 --> 31:26.156
It'd be nice if it was the forrner and
I can get one under my belt. One what?

31:26.257 --> 31:29.934
A win. Never beaten this bastard
in my life, if I'm honest with you.

31:29.976 --> 31:31.984
I'd rather you weren't,
Declan. Cheers.

31:32.009 --> 31:33.956
Rights. Into battle, eh'?

31:34.136 --> 31:36.123
Yeah.

31:47.883 --> 31:51.742
The boys are
keen for a catch-up.

31:52.365 --> 31:59.026
Is that supposed to scare me, Ted? Heads-up
- your boys are hardly the Corleones.

32:00.634 --> 32:03.058
<i>#</i> I've got the keys
to the highway. <i>#</i>

32:03.283 --> 32:09.141
Yes, I get it, Mike - it's something to do
with the bloody keys. Enough of the games.

32:09.255 --> 32:12.755
Jeez, Ted. I've already given your mob more than you
bloody deserve. All right, because I'm a nice guy -

32:17.978 --> 32:20.182
ask Declan if he can count.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.363
What, that's it'?

32:34.722 --> 32:36.700
VVHISPERSI Psst!

32:36.879 --> 32:38.826
WHISPERS: Declan!

32:42.507 --> 32:46.104
McCarthy said, 'Can Declan count?'
Of course I can fucking count.

32:46.313 --> 32:48.672
No, that's what he said,
like it was important.

32:48.697 --> 32:52.634
Vvhen? Just now in the bogs.
He said, 'Can Declan count?'

32:52.664 --> 32:54.596
Yeah. Yeah, I got it, Ted.

32:54.790 --> 32:56.585
Good.

32:59.994 --> 33:04.396
What do you think is actually
happening now with Wolf'?

33:04.421 --> 33:06.297
At court?
Yeah.

33:07.703 --> 33:12.274
The judge comes in, and everyone stands up.
Why do they that?

33:12.302 --> 33:15.265
Cos he's the judge'?
That is elitism.

33:15.290 --> 33:18.056
He's the judge, the most
important person in the room.

33:18.081 --> 33:22.982
Says who he's the most important? Says
the law, retard. Can women be judges?

33:23.043 --> 33:26.620
I don't think so. That is sexism.
Yeah, why can't women be judges?

33:26.645 --> 33:29.198
I think they get too emotional.

33:40.522 --> 33:44.303
Detective, how many members of your
unit have completed statements

33:44.446 --> 33:47.161
that they saw the
defendant toss the keys'?

33:47.207 --> 33:50.241
Three, sir. Lying
bastards_ Silence!

33:51.211 --> 33:57.601
These keys, which we enter into evidence as Exhibit
32, will link Mr West directly to the crime,

33:57.672 --> 34:02.137
as they are the keys taken from
the van carrying the missing money.

34:02.162 --> 34:04.196
The clerk will duly enter
this as Exhibit 32.

34:04.406 --> 34:08.592
Your Honour, I haven't been given a
chance to examine these keys for myself.

34:08.676 --> 34:12.719
Your Honour, the Crown has presented to
the defence photographs of all the keys,

34:12.804 --> 34:16.974
taken at the station when they were first
entered into evidence by the OC Evidence.

34:17.152 --> 34:23.676
Still, always nice to get your hands on
the real thing, though, don't you think?

34:26.135 --> 34:29.987
Thank you. Detective, after the
keys were entered into evidence,

34:30.071 --> 34:32.621
what did you do next'?
We contacted the security company,

34:32.737 --> 34:37.773
who sent a representative to examine the keys to
confirrn that they are the keys from the van.

34:38.014 --> 34:43.842
Your Honour, again, as per the brief of evidence, we
will be presenting witnesses from the security company,

34:44.001 --> 34:46.239
who will confirm that,
indeed, these keys are-

34:46.399 --> 34:49.312
There's a key missing!
Excuse me, Counsel?

34:49.536 --> 34:54.626
In this photo there are eight keys on
the key ring - here there's seven.

34:54.650 --> 34:58.079
Are you sure'?
Oh, I can count, Your Honour.

34:58.716 --> 35:02.616
The missing key, if I'm not mistaken, Your
Honour, is the rather flash-looking one,

35:02.650 --> 35:07.592
with the serial number on it. This is, I believe,
the only key that can open the back of the vehicle,

35:07.750 --> 35:15.026
the only one that can give someone access to
the actual money. Am I right there, Detective?

35:15.051 --> 35:20.255
The only thing I can tell you, sir, is the correct
number of keys were there the last time I saw.

35:20.480 --> 35:25.144
Your Honour, the OC Evidence will
testify that when the photo was taken,

35:25.169 --> 35:29.232
the key was part of the bunch,
<i>as</i> the photo proves.

35:29.277 --> 35:32.057
So where is it now?
We believe, ma'am,

35:32.182 --> 35:37.040
that at some stage after the keys were
photographed and placed in the evidence storage,

35:37.065 --> 35:40.365
- that the key has somehow been mislaid.
- Oh, come on!

35:40.450 --> 35:44.190
Mislaid? We anticipate that we
will recover it before the trial.

35:44.229 --> 35:47.313
Oh, and this anticipation
is based on'?

35:47.374 --> 35:49.575
Our belief that
it cannot have gone far.

35:49.606 --> 35:55.587
Oh! So does this belief explain why you
have repeatedly delayed this heaflng,

35:55.657 --> 35:59.870
presumably so you can carry on looking for your
missing key while an innocent man rots on remand?

35:59.931 --> 36:03.956
And having failed to find this missing key,
you're now trying t0 sneak it past this court.

36:03.981 --> 36:06.356
VVell, that's kinda low_ Don't you
think so, Your Honour? Yeah, I do too!

36:06.402 --> 36:08.274
Too bloody right!
Silence!

36:08.453 --> 36:11.509
Your Honour, there is no attempt to
mislead the court here. Bullshit!

36:11.534 --> 36:14.049
No, this doesn't seem right.
Enough!

36:14.243 --> 36:21.077
This may be so, Your Honour, but there is also no
key - the key piece of evidence against my client.

36:21.102 --> 36:25.048
I would argue, ma'am, that there is therefore
no grounds for this trial to proceed,

36:25.073 --> 36:29.302
and I would argue further that you have
no choice but to let this man go free!

36:29.372 --> 36:31.445
Enough! Enough!

36:45.416 --> 36:48.187
ALL CHANT: Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

36:48.345 --> 36:51.350
You're in for a few beers'?

36:55.339 --> 36:57.294
Cheers.

36:57.609 --> 37:00.361
You cost my son six
months of his life.

37:00.556 --> 37:05.096
No, Wolf cost himself six months of
his life, because he was careless.

37:05.275 --> 37:10.892
Well, he won't make that mistake again. Just like
we won't make the mistake of trusting a bloody cop.

37:10.917 --> 37:15.849
Is that what it was? Felt to rne like Rita had her
hand round my cock, and all she had to do was squeeze.

37:16.007 --> 37:20.260
Thanks for that image, Mike
You're welcome, Ted.

37:21.371 --> 37:24.723
You stole from us.
No, you stole.

37:24.917 --> 37:29.473
All I did was get what I deserved after the grief
you bastards have given me over the years_

37:29.498 --> 37:31.407
I now consider us even.

37:32.190 --> 37:34.571
I'm not sure I agree with that.

37:36.253 --> 37:43.148
How about now'? I didn't have to do that, but
I did. Sure, if it'd been Lefty they nicked,

37:43.173 --> 37:47.163
we wouldn't be having this conversation -
he'd be taking it up the arse in Pare.

37:47.206 --> 37:49.990
But it was your boy,
and I saved him.

37:52.506 --> 37:56.404
DD SMASH: <i>#</i> You want repetition,

Yeah, good luck with that.

Tell me the truth.
What's the matter'?

Um,...

38:40.775 --> 38:46.797
Uh, well, uh, when you were inside,
there was something I didn't tell you.

What?

39:07.529 --> 39:12.195
Man, they let you out. Or did you
escape? Please say you escaped.

one thing to tell you - I love your daughter,

40:07.455 --> 40:12.032
and I ended up with a dog.
How fucking tragic is that'?

40:12.206 --> 40:16.837
Oh. I was more wondering what
kind of dog it is, what breed.

We're not naming
our daughter Einstein.

Einsteina?

44:01.135 --> 44:03.319
She's gonna be beautiful.

44:04.085 --> 44:08.029
Like Helena Troy.
Who'?

44:08.875 --> 44:10.733
That old Greek story.

44:12.170 --> 44:17.677
This chick was so beautiful, this guy sent, like,
a thousand ships to go get her or something.

44:17.762 --> 44:20.733
Oh, Helen of Troy. Oh.

44:22.838 --> 44:26.515

44:29.908 --> 44:31.880
I like Helena, though.

44:32.288 --> 44:34.121
WHISPERS: Helena.

44:45.576 --> 44:48.182
What sort of family
doesn't do Christmas?

44:48.229 --> 44:51.712
Don't try and logic with our superstitions.
They just are what they are.

44:51.794 --> 44:54.900
This is why we don't do jobs at
Christmastime - everything turns to shit.

44:55.058 --> 44:57.709
Just get another driver.
I'll do it.

44:57.740 --> 45:00.044
Look - he did hire a stripper!

45:03.179 --> 45:05.327
Mum! She's fucking crazy!

45:08.842 --> 45:10.750
I need to talk to Wolf.

45:11.763 --> 45:12.517
Everything all right'?

45:13.305 --> 45:19.531
