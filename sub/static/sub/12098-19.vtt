<i>Billy doesn't know what to do.</i>

00:10.076 --> 00:13.078
<i>He'd like to tell Leslie</i>

00:15.081 --> 00:17.583

00:17.584 --> 00:19.585
<i>Mary's not happy.</i>
<i>Life is no fun,</i>

00:19.586 --> 00:22.588

<i>is going to run,</i>

00:22.589 --> 00:24.590

01:15.642 --> 01:17.142
So the drunk says,

01:17.143 --> 01:21.146
"Madam, I was speaking
to the duck."

01:27.654 --> 01:28.654
More coffee, Burt?

01:28.655 --> 01:30.155
No. No. No, thanks.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.156
How do you like it, Ma?

01:31.157 --> 01:32.658
Oh, light, no sugar.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.159
No, I mean the house.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.661
Oh.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.162
It's lovely.

01:37.163 --> 01:38.664
We were so lucky to find it.

01:38.665 --> 01:42.167
An adorable Cape Cod house
on a pretty block.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.169
So quiet and peaceful.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.771
Yeah, you meet any
of your neighbors yet?

01:49.676 --> 01:51.677
A few.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.679
They seem very nice.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
Fine.

01:58.184 --> 01:59.185
Hello?

02:06.693 --> 02:07.694
Oh yeah?

02:13.199 --> 02:15.200
Was that for you?

02:15.201 --> 02:17.202
I hope not.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.705
I smell something burning.

02:19.706 --> 02:20.706
Oh, it's the pie!

02:20.707 --> 02:21.707
I forgot to turn off the oven.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.208
I'll get it. I'll get it.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.710
I won't be a second.

02:24.711 --> 02:25.711
Will you excuse me, please?

02:25.712 --> 02:27.212
More coffee, Mary?

02:27.213 --> 02:29.215
Oh, yes, thank you.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.221
It's nothing.

02:40.226 --> 02:46.732
So... uh...
let me ask you.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.735
Have you decided what to do
with the spare room yet?

02:49.736 --> 02:53.739
Oh, yes, well, see, Danny and I
are sort of at a stalemate.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.741
He wants a pool table,
and I want a family room,

02:55.742 --> 02:58.744
you know, so that the neighbors
can come over and chat,

02:58.745 --> 03:00.245
play bridge.

03:02.749 --> 03:06.252
I'd go for the pool table.

03:11.257 --> 03:14.259
Well, it wasn't the pie.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.260
What was it?

03:15.261 --> 03:16.261
The spare room.

03:16.262 --> 03:17.763
Oh...

03:17.764 --> 03:20.265
Well, we couldn't decide
what to do with it anyway.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.267
Listen, we have cantaloupe,

03:22.268 --> 03:24.269
and we have pie for dessert.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.270
Who wants some?

03:25.271 --> 03:27.272
Uh-uh.

03:27.273 --> 03:28.774
Kids... Come home.

03:28.775 --> 03:29.775
Ma...

03:29.776 --> 03:31.777
There's room enough
for both of you. Really.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.779
We can fix up Grandma's
old room in the attic.

03:33.780 --> 03:34.780
Come home.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.281
This is our home.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.783
This is crazy.

03:37.784 --> 03:41.286
Mary, see, if we move out,
then they win,

03:41.287 --> 03:44.289
and if they win,
then nothing changes.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.292
Ma, we have to stay.

03:47.293 --> 03:50.295
We can't change anything
by running away.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.298
So we can't let them
chase us out.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.302
We'll handle this.
Stay back. Polly?

03:57.303 --> 03:58.303
What?

03:58.304 --> 03:59.305
Get the door.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.310
All right, what
the hell do you want?

04:05.311 --> 04:07.813
Hi, I'm Mr. Pfeiffer.
This is my wife, Helen.

04:07.814 --> 04:08.814
Yeah?

04:08.815 --> 04:11.817
Well, we just wanted you to know
that not everyone is like that.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.318
Not in this state,

04:13.319 --> 04:15.320
and certainly
not on this street.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.822
The block committee
just wanted us

04:16.822 --> 04:17.822
to welcome you
to the neighborhood,

04:17.824 --> 04:20.826
and not to judge us by the-
the acts of a few hoodlums.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.828
This is for you, Mrs....

04:22.829 --> 04:23.829
Oh, we're not...

04:23.830 --> 04:25.330
Dallas.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.332
Polly and Danny.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.334
Thank you very much.
Will you come in?

04:29.335 --> 04:30.836
Oh, no, thank you.

04:30.837 --> 04:31.837
We should go back

04:31.838 --> 04:35.341
and put out the fire
in our living room.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.847
Welcome.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.849
Thank you. Thank you.

04:43.850 --> 04:44.850
Good luck.

04:44.851 --> 04:45.851
Good night.

04:45.852 --> 04:46.853
Thanks.

04:53.359 --> 04:55.361
No, here.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.378
It's fine.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.384
Actually, it's great.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.391
Oh, Billy, I feel terrible.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.392
This place is so expensive.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.894
Oh, hey, it's nothing.

05:28.895 --> 05:29.895
How can you afford it?

05:29.896 --> 05:31.897
I saved a little here,
a little there,

05:31.898 --> 05:32.898
sold some clothing.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.900
Well, now I know

05:34.901 --> 05:36.401
why we haven't been
out together for so long.

05:36.402 --> 05:37.903
You do?

05:37.904 --> 05:38.904
You've been saving up
for tonight.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.405
Yeah.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.907
Look, I have something
to tell you,

05:41.908 --> 05:43.408
and I wanted everything
to be nice.

05:43.409 --> 05:44.910
Well, I have something
to tell you too.

05:44.911 --> 05:45.911
You do?

05:45.912 --> 05:48.413
Mm-hm.
I told my parents about us.

05:48.414 --> 05:49.414
What did you tell them?

05:49.415 --> 05:50.916
That we were seeing each other.

05:50.917 --> 05:51.917
Oh.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.419
And that I love you,
and that you loved me,

05:54.420 --> 05:55.921
and that our age difference
didn't matter,

05:55.922 --> 05:57.924
because I've never been
so happy in my life.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.427
Now, what did you want
to tell me?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.430
We...

06:05.431 --> 06:06.932
I...

06:06.933 --> 06:08.934
Waiter...

06:08.935 --> 06:12.437
There's a very cheesy odor
coming from this veal.

06:12.438 --> 06:13.939
Ah, so there is.

06:13.940 --> 06:14.940
What is it?

06:14.941 --> 06:15.942
Cheese.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.963
Very good.
Now, get away, we're eating.

06:23.449 --> 06:24.950
So, what did you want
to tell me?

06:24.951 --> 06:27.452
I can't say it.

06:27.453 --> 06:28.954
Billy, if you have
something to say,

06:28.955 --> 06:30.956
you just have to come
right out with it.

06:30.957 --> 06:32.457
It's the grown-up thing to do.

06:32.458 --> 06:33.959
I'll understand.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.460
You're right. Thanks.

06:35.461 --> 06:36.962
Now, what is it?

06:36.963 --> 06:38.965
We can't see each other anymore.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.478
Leslie?

06:53.479 --> 06:54.980
Leslie? Leslie!

06:57.984 --> 07:01.487
Could you bring her
a fork, please?

07:08.494 --> 07:12.497
She seems to be having a little
trouble with her fettuccini,

07:12.498 --> 07:15.000
and bring some more sauce.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.001
Leslie, Leslie...

07:16.002 --> 07:17.502
Oh, I must have passed out.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.504
Leslie, try and understand.

07:19.505 --> 07:22.507
Aah!

07:25.011 --> 07:28.014
Leslie. Leslie...

07:29.515 --> 07:33.518
She lost a contact.

07:33.519 --> 07:34.519
Leslie...

07:34.520 --> 07:37.022
Leslie, you're getting yourself
all messed up.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.023
Messed up?

07:38.024 --> 07:39.524
I'm getting messed up?

07:39.525 --> 07:41.526
Do I care if I'm
getting messed up?

07:41.527 --> 07:42.527
Les...

07:42.528 --> 07:44.530
This is how much I care
if I'm messed up.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.534
Leslie, it's not
the end of the world.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.036
Oh, not for you.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.538
For you,
it's just the beginning.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.541
Excuse me, sir,
are you finished with this?

08:01.547 --> 08:04.549
You're not taking this
very well.

08:04.550 --> 08:08.053
Well, it doesn't matter
how I'm taking this,

08:08.054 --> 08:09.554
and it doesn't matter
how I look,

08:09.555 --> 08:13.058
because when I get home tonight,
I'm gonna kill myself.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.559
Leslie, I'm sorry.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.063
Madam, I'm afraid that I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.564
Very well.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.067
I understand.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.570
Thank you.

08:25.571 --> 08:29.074
Goodbye, Billy.
It's been great.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.105
Aw, Chuck, I can't stand it.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.606
I just can't stand it.

09:01.607 --> 09:02.607
I know, Bob.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.109
I mean, I love Wendy
more than anything,

09:04.110 --> 09:06.111
and if they take her
away from us,

09:06.112 --> 09:09.114
I...I...

09:09.115 --> 09:11.616
I don't know what I'm gonna do!

09:14.620 --> 09:15.620
Easy, Bob, easy.

09:15.621 --> 09:18.623
Oh, God.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.125
Look at that little face.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.626
Oh, I feel so bad.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.129
I've been so busy, living,
dying, running for sheriff,

09:24.130 --> 09:25.630
I've hardly even
got to know her.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.632
Oh, Burt, listen,
don't let them take Wendy.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.634
I mean, I'll just die
if we lose her.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.636
That's the way it is
with babies.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.638
No matter what you do,
you lose them anyway.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.140
They grow up.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.642
Mr. Philosophy.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.644
Look, look.
Look at her. Look.

09:39.645 --> 09:43.148
She's got her foot
in her mouth. I love it.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.149
Oh, Burt...

09:44.150 --> 09:46.651
he can't lose her.
He just can't.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.653
I don't know what I'll
do if he loses her.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.155
Hey, Burt, cheer Mary up.

09:50.156 --> 09:54.159
Give her the old
"You lose them anyway" story.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.162
You should see the way
she smiles at me

09:57.163 --> 09:58.663
in the morning
when I come in here.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.665
Or the way she pokes
her finger in my eye

10:00.666 --> 10:04.169
and says, "Ut ut."
I love that.

10:04.170 --> 10:07.672
Or the way she...
Or the way she...

10:07.673 --> 10:09.174
Or... Or the way...

10:18.684 --> 10:20.185
Well, this is good.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.187
Just the strength
and support I'd hoped for.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.189
What? No, no, no. What?
We're fine. We're fine.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.690
Bob told us a real sad story

10:25.691 --> 10:30.695
about what Charlie McCarthy's
doing these days.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.697
I guess you'd like us
to leave, huh?

10:32.698 --> 10:34.699
Well, Ma, it's a little
hard for her to sleep

10:34.700 --> 10:37.702
with four people
sobbing into her crib.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.204
Good night, Wendy, darling.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.206
Sleep well.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.708
Wendy...

10:43.709 --> 10:46.711
Bla-la-la...

10:46.712 --> 10:48.713
Grandpa.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.216
Night, Wendy.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.718
Good night,
little... Wendy...

10:53.719 --> 10:54.720
Wendy, Wendy!

11:30.256 --> 11:33.258
I'm not gonna let you go.

11:33.259 --> 11:36.261
No way.

11:36.262 --> 11:41.266
You know,
I've never broken a law.

11:41.267 --> 11:45.770
This time, forget it.

11:45.771 --> 11:52.277
If they take you from me,
they might as well take my life.

11:52.278 --> 11:56.281
I love you, little girl.

11:56.282 --> 12:00.286
I'm not gonna let you go.

12:08.294 --> 12:11.296
Now, this is the first
meal he's serving,

12:11.297 --> 12:13.298
and I want everybody to be
on their best behavior.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.800
He has worked
in some of the finest houses,

12:15.801 --> 12:17.803
and he's used to good manners.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.306
Good morning, Saunders.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.307
Good morning, madam.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.809
I believe you have
met my family.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.311
Well, part of my family.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.813
Well, actually, what's left
of part of my family.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.315
Yes, madam.

12:30.316 --> 12:31.316
Good morning.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.317
ALL: Good morning.

12:32.318 --> 12:35.320
Ooh, my, how pretty.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.321
Green eggs.

12:36.322 --> 12:40.325
Is this St. Patrick's Day?

12:40.326 --> 12:42.327
Madam, these are
eggs Florentine.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.329
Ooh, and they're lovely.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.331
I have a dress that color.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.332
What's the green stuff?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.333
Spinach.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.334
Pass.

12:49.335 --> 12:50.336
I'll take his portion.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.840
Hey, these are kind of
gooey, pal.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.342
Let me give you a little tip.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.344
If you give the pan
a couple of quick shots,

12:59.345 --> 13:00.346
it'll get the goo cooked.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.350
Oh, no, thank you.

13:05.351 --> 13:08.353
It's nothing personal,
but I just never eat eggs.

13:08.354 --> 13:11.356
You know, I'm always afraid
of getting the slimy part.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.858
You know, the colorless
slimy part

13:13.859 --> 13:17.362
that you don't know you've got
until it's in your mouth...

13:19.365 --> 13:21.866
This is absolutely incredible.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.369
I know, they are such
picky eaters.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.871
I've never seen
anything like it in my life.

13:26.872 --> 13:27.872
Just look at him.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.875
He's revolting.

13:33.879 --> 13:34.879
Jess!

13:34.880 --> 13:36.381
Jess, I can't stand it.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.382
I'm losing my mind.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.883
I can't live without you.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.385
I can't go on, Jess.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.887
I can't, I can't, I can't.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.890
Oh, Jess, take me back,
I beg of you, please.

13:45.891 --> 13:46.891
Take me back.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.894
Hi, kids.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.398
Get up. You are making
a fool of yourself.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.900
I'm sorry.

13:55.901 --> 13:57.402
I lost my head.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.403
I... I'm sorry.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.905
Benson!

14:01.907 --> 14:04.909
Who are you?

14:04.910 --> 14:08.413
Are you the new man in her life?

14:08.414 --> 14:12.917
Jess, are you crazy?
You and him?

14:12.918 --> 14:16.421
Hey, what the hell, it's 1980,
and I'm a liberal guy.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.424
Let me tell you, my man.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.427
You have got one hell
of a fight on your hands.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.431
This time I'm gonna do it.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.932
This time,
I'm really going to do it!

14:27.933 --> 14:29.434
Leslie!

14:29.435 --> 14:31.436
Cover your eyes, folks.
This isn't gonna be pretty.

14:31.437 --> 14:32.937
Leslie, that's a spoon.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.439
Oh!

14:34.440 --> 14:36.442
Oh!

14:51.457 --> 14:53.458
Hiya, Gramps.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.960
Hiya.

14:55.961 --> 14:59.464
I'd like some coffee, boy.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.966
Boy?

15:02.468 --> 15:06.471
I sincerely hope, madam,
there's a child in this room.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.473
Daddy, this is Saunders.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.475
Saunders, this is my father.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.476
Hiya.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.479
You have just introduced
a bush as your father, madam.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.483
Who is your mother,
a palm tree on Oahu?

15:18.484 --> 15:19.484
Good day, madam.
I am leaving.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.986
Oh... dear.

15:23.489 --> 15:27.992
I think I have termites.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.494
And they didn't mean it.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.995
Oh, Saunders, I am so sorry.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.997
They're really not bad.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.999
Madam, I have worked
all over the world.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.501
I've worked in embassies
under siege.

15:36.502 --> 15:39.003
I once served dinner
for Idi Amin,

15:39.004 --> 15:40.505
who would throw your family out

15:40.506 --> 15:41.506
for their bad manners.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.508
You did? Really?
You served Eydie?

15:43.509 --> 15:44.509
Yes, and madam,
let me tell you...

15:44.510 --> 15:46.010
Oh, I just love them.

15:46.011 --> 15:50.014
Steve and Eydie...
I just love the specials.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.016
Madam, you don't seem
to understand...

15:52.017 --> 15:54.519
Are they really
all that happy, huh?

15:54.520 --> 15:57.021
Saunders, what are you doing?

15:57.022 --> 15:58.523
I'm leaving, madam.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.525
I need work, but not this badly.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.026
Oh, no, Saunders,
please, don't leave us.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.528
We really need you.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.530
Now, I know
we're a strange bunch,

16:05.531 --> 16:07.532
an eccentric bunch,
a crazy bunch,

16:07.533 --> 16:09.534
but we're not a bad bunch.

16:09.535 --> 16:12.036
There isn't a one among us
who would harm a soul.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.038
Madam, I'm not accusing
your family of being killers.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.039
I'm only saying...

16:15.040 --> 16:18.042
There is one.
I cannot tell a lie.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.545
There is one killer
in the family.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.046
There were two, one left,

16:22.047 --> 16:24.048
so we just have one,
and he's not a real killer.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.550
I mean, he's just...

16:25.551 --> 16:27.051
Madam, I promise you,
it doesn't matter.

16:27.052 --> 16:28.052
I cannot stay.

16:28.053 --> 16:30.555
Oh, dear.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.558
I don't know what to do.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.059
I was praying it would work out.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.561
I like you so much.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.564
Madam, please.
I cannot stand crying.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.567
Why?

16:42.568 --> 16:45.069
Because it always makes me
do something stupid.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.572
I can't help it.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.074
I just know if you'd
stay, you'd like us.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.576
I know you would.

16:51.577 --> 16:52.577
Madam, please?

16:52.578 --> 16:57.082
And you have such a nice voice.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.087
Very well, madam, I'll stay.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.589
If you promise to stop crying,
I'll stay.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.090
Oh, really?

17:07.092 --> 17:08.092
Well, for a day, maybe.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.093
I don't know.
We'll see.

17:09.094 --> 17:10.094
Yes, good.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.096
You!

17:12.097 --> 17:13.598
Steward, spray me.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.101
I'm crawling with caterpillars.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.105
Maybe for an hour.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.114
Well, that's that.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.616
Oh, my goodness.

17:31.617 --> 17:35.620
I haven't decorated so much
since my Sweet 16 party.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.121
How about you, Saunders?

17:37.122 --> 17:40.625
I've never been either sweet
or 16, Mrs. Tate.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.127
Hey, Sandy.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.129
"Sandy"?

17:45.130 --> 17:47.131
Them Swedish meatballs is burnt.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.133
The meatballs?
My meatballs?

17:49.134 --> 17:51.135
I just threw a little
cold water in the oven

17:51.136 --> 17:52.136
to cool them down.

17:52.137 --> 17:53.638
I guess that wasn't
such a good idea.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.140
I'll go glaze your goose.

17:56.642 --> 17:57.642
Mrs. Tate...

17:57.643 --> 17:59.143
Yes.

17:59.144 --> 18:01.646
Is there something
the matter, Saunders?

18:01.647 --> 18:04.649
Madam, if you don't remove him
from the kitchen immediately,

18:04.650 --> 18:06.150
I'll be forced
to call someone in

18:06.151 --> 18:09.153
and have him put to sleep.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.657
I'll have a little chat
with him.

18:12.658 --> 18:14.158
Thank you.

18:14.159 --> 18:17.662
Do you have group rates, doctor?

18:21.166 --> 18:22.667
Hi there!

18:30.676 --> 18:31.676
Who was that, Saunders?

18:31.677 --> 18:34.178
Oh, no one at all.
Just a fellow with a doll.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.179
Probably a street entertainer.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.181
Oh, no, that's my cousin.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.183
Which one?

18:42.688 --> 18:46.691
Very nice.
Very, very nice.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.694
That was Saunders,
and he didn't know.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.195
Well, give me
a Scotch neat, then.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.197
Make it a double, huh?

18:58.704 --> 18:59.704
Hi, Corinne.

18:59.705 --> 19:00.705
Hi, Danny.

19:00.706 --> 19:01.706
This is Polly Dawson.
Corinne Tate.

19:01.707 --> 19:03.207
Hi.
Hi.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.208
Nice to meet you.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.209
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.210
This is
Dr. Posner.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.712
Hello.
Hello.

19:07.713 --> 19:08.713
Hi, doc.

19:08.714 --> 19:09.714
Somebody sick?

19:09.715 --> 19:12.717
No, Dr. Posner
is a psychiatrist.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.718
No kidding?

19:13.719 --> 19:16.220
Doc, you're just the guy
I wanted to see.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.723
A lot of people tell me that.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.726
I, uh... I'm having trouble
remembering things

19:21.727 --> 19:23.728
with the letter 12 in them.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.731
Is that weird?

19:27.733 --> 19:29.233
12 is not a letter.

19:29.234 --> 19:32.236
See, way back there,
I knew that.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.238
Thanks a lot.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.740
Can I give you
a couple of bucks?

19:35.741 --> 19:37.241
No, no, no, no.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.744
Your breakthrough
is payment enough.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.245
What a guy.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.748
I was only trying
to help the guy out.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.249
I know, Dutch, I know,

19:45.250 --> 19:48.753
but, you see, Saunders has
his own way of doing things,

19:48.754 --> 19:50.755
so you can just
relax now, Dutch,

19:50.756 --> 19:52.757
and be a member of the family.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.259
Okay.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.261
I wish I had that offer.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.764
Okay, pal.
Kitchen's all yours.

19:59.765 --> 20:00.765
Carry on.

20:02.267 --> 20:03.768
I'll get it.

20:11.276 --> 20:16.280
I know I should just
keep walking. I know it.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.282
"Calm down."
"Calm down."

20:18.283 --> 20:19.283
What do you mean, "Calm down"?

20:19.284 --> 20:20.785
Do you realize what I just did?

20:20.786 --> 20:22.286
We're the Campbells.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.788
I'm not a bit surprised.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.290
Do you realize?

20:26.291 --> 20:27.792
Do you have any idea?

20:27.793 --> 20:30.294
Burt, those voting booths
are a little tricky.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.796
Tricky?

20:31.797 --> 20:33.798
I voted for the other guy.

20:33.799 --> 20:34.799
Uh-huh.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.300
I actually pulled down
the wrong lever

20:36.301 --> 20:37.301
and voted for my opponent.

20:37.302 --> 20:38.302
Tricky...

20:38.303 --> 20:40.304
Hi there.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.306
Burt Campbell knows no color,
and thanks for your support.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.808
I didn't vote.

20:43.809 --> 20:44.809
You didn't vote?
You didn't vote?

20:44.810 --> 20:46.310
There's time.
We got my car, we'll go.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.812
No, no, no.
I'm not registered.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.313
I've only just moved here.

20:49.314 --> 20:51.315
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll have a vodka. Phew!

20:51.316 --> 20:52.316
Make it a double.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.317
Make it a triple.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.819
Make it no ice,
and thank you very much,

20:54.820 --> 20:56.320
and that'll be all,

20:56.321 --> 20:58.322
and I want to thank you again
for your support.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.824
Uncle Burt, I'm so excited.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.326
Election eve.

21:05.831 --> 21:07.331
There you are,
Mr. Campbell.

21:07.332 --> 21:08.333
Oh, thanks.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.838
Would you care for another?

21:14.840 --> 21:15.840
What am I, crazy?

21:15.841 --> 21:18.843
Is that a rhetorical
question, sir?

21:18.844 --> 21:20.845
I can't drink.

21:20.846 --> 21:21.846
Burt.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.347
What is the matter with you?

21:23.348 --> 21:24.348
Mary, what if I get arrested

21:24.349 --> 21:25.349
for drunk driving

21:25.350 --> 21:26.851
on the night I get elected?

21:28.353 --> 21:30.355
Here. Excuse me.

21:34.278 --> 21:35.359
Oh, Jess, I can't stand it.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.361
Please, please!

21:37.362 --> 21:39.363
Chester, I told you
never to come near me

21:39.364 --> 21:40.364
or this house anymore!

21:43.368 --> 21:45.369
I just want you to know, sir,

21:45.370 --> 21:47.872
we are all honored
by your presence.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.875
True.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.877
The world will never forget

21:52.878 --> 21:57.382
how you showed up Hitler
at the 1936 Olympics.

22:00.385 --> 22:03.888
Good bless you, Jesse Owens!

22:08.894 --> 22:09.894
Miss Dawson,

22:09.895 --> 22:11.896
are you considering
joining this family?

22:11.897 --> 22:13.898
Yes, I've thought about it.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.900
Why?

22:15.901 --> 22:18.402
Because I love Danny.

22:18.403 --> 22:21.406
Well, I love artichokes,
but I don't wish to become one.

22:23.408 --> 22:25.409
Okay, everybody.
It's time.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.911
It's time.
Come on, it's time.

22:26.912 --> 22:27.912
Gather around
the television set.

22:27.913 --> 22:28.913
Hurry.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.421
Danny, could you leave it open
so I can at least hear?

22:40.425 --> 22:42.426
Quiet, everybody.

22:42.427 --> 22:43.427
REPORTER:
<i>First results are coming in.</i>

22:49.434 --> 22:51.936
"Bart"? "Bart"? What "Bart"?

22:51.937 --> 22:52.937
Where's the phone?

22:52.938 --> 22:53.938
Quiet.

22:53.939 --> 22:57.942

<i>is Prentice, 57, Campbell, 56.</i>

22:57.943 --> 22:59.944
That's very close.
One vote!

22:59.945 --> 23:01.445
Yeah, one vote. I'm gonna
lose by one vote.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.447
My own vote.
This is...

23:03.448 --> 23:04.949
Jessica, take it easy.
It's early yet.

23:04.950 --> 23:05.950
Ma!

23:05.951 --> 23:06.951
Mrs. Tate?

23:06.952 --> 23:07.952
Must've been the excitement.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.453
She fainted.
Get an ambulance.

23:09.454 --> 23:10.454
She just fainted.

23:10.455 --> 23:11.956
POSNER: She
didn't just faint.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.457
What is it?

Oh, for God's sake.
Get an ambulance. Now.
