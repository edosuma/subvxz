00:09.999 --> 00:11.998
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

00:11.999 --> 00:12.999
- Good!
- Kourtney looks the

00:13.000 --> 00:15.998
best she's ever looked.
She's laughing again, and just

00:15.999 --> 00:17.998
being the Kourtney I knew, like,
five years ago.

00:17.999 --> 00:19.998
- Damn!
- I told you I'm

00:19.999 --> 00:21.998
- going to Montana Sunday?
- Who's gonna watch the

00:21.999 --> 00:23.998
- kids?
- You guys are taking

00:23.999 --> 00:25.998
them to San Diego.

00:25.999 --> 00:28.998
Being in the car with
three toddlers is the best form

00:28.999 --> 00:31.998
of birth control.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.998
I just... I just can't
do this.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.998
Did you take anything today?

00:36.999 --> 00:38.998
My life is officially over.

00:38.999 --> 00:40.998
- I just want it to be over.
- We have to call the

00:40.999 --> 00:44.999
- police.
- I gotta go.

00:50.999 --> 00:54.998
Hello?

00:54.999 --> 00:57.998
- Stop.
- Your fave!

00:57.999 --> 00:59.998
Wait, can I Snapchat you?

00:59.999 --> 01:01.998
Look what I brought you...!

01:01.999 --> 01:06.998
- Your favorite!
- You're so cute!

01:06.999 --> 01:09.998
- You're so nice!
- Why is it all white?

01:09.999 --> 01:11.998
Wait.

01:11.999 --> 01:15.998
- Ew! Don't actually kiss me.
- Oh. Okay, I won't.

01:15.999 --> 01:17.998
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome.

01:17.999 --> 01:20.998
I love what's going on outside.
Remember when we used to do work

01:20.999 --> 01:23.998
in the backyard and I used to
bring Krispy Kremes to all the

01:23.999 --> 01:25.998
- guys?
- Should we give them a

01:25.999 --> 01:27.998
- box?
- Give them a box and

01:27.999 --> 01:30.998
- tell them to enjoy.
- Will you do it?

01:30.999 --> 01:32.998
I feel like you're, like, a
woman, I'm, like, a little

01:32.999 --> 01:35.998
- child.
- This is how it's done.

01:35.999 --> 01:39.998
Hey, guys.
Want some donuts?

01:39.999 --> 01:42.998
Donuts!

01:42.999 --> 01:45.998
I'm gonna put them here so
they're not in the sun.

01:45.999 --> 01:46.999
But don't leave them out here,
too hot.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.999
- Okay.
- Okay? Krispy Kreme.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.998
- Thank you!
- See, Kylie?

01:51.999 --> 01:54.998
Pretty easy.
Sugar makes anybody happy.

01:54.999 --> 01:56.998
That was really nice, Mom.

01:56.999 --> 01:58.999
You need to have, like,
little lessons in how to be a

01:59.000 --> 02:02.999
great hostess.
Are you going up my nostril?

02:19.999 --> 02:21.998
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:21.999 --> 02:23.998
- Hi.
- How was your trip,

02:23.999 --> 02:25.998
Kourt?
Did you talk to Scott when you

02:25.999 --> 02:28.998
- were gone?
- Um, no.

02:28.999 --> 02:32.998
Kim and I were at my
house and we were in the

02:32.999 --> 02:36.998
kitchen, and Corey called
and put us on speaker so we

02:36.999 --> 02:38.998
could just listen to their
conversation.

02:38.999 --> 02:41.998
But he was really upset and
having a hard time and said he

02:41.999 --> 02:44.998
missed you and he had no reason
to live, and it was pretty

02:44.999 --> 02:46.998
scary.
We didn't know whether to call

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
- 911...
- He was literally, like,

02:48.000 --> 02:52.998
you couldn't hear sentences,
like, he was slurring his words.

02:52.999 --> 02:55.999
The note that he sent Khloe was,
like, "Tell Bugs I love her and

02:56.000 --> 02:58.998
I can't go on without her."
They say you always

02:58.999 --> 03:01.998
- should call 911.
- So we... I almost did

03:01.999 --> 03:05.998
because then he was crying on
the phone the whole time.

03:05.999 --> 03:09.998
And Chris said, "I've
never seen him cry that hard.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.998
All he does is cry."
But... then I got a text

03:11.999 --> 03:14.998
last night, and I'm like, oh, my
God, Scott just took some...

03:14.999 --> 03:15.999
- They said he was drunk...
- Last night?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.998
Last night.
You know? So after that whole

03:20.999 --> 03:21.999
thing, and he's crying and he's
this and he's that.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.998
Yeah.
I think Scott put himself in the

03:25.999 --> 03:29.998
situation that he's in, with his
actions.

03:29.999 --> 03:32.998
I don't know, I just need to,
like, live, because I'm also,

03:32.999 --> 03:35.999
like, not just making decisions
for me but for, you know, my

03:36.000 --> 03:40.998
three children, and it's really
about him deciding just what

03:40.999 --> 03:44.998
kind of life he wants to live.
That's the thing, it's, like,

03:44.999 --> 03:46.998
- then do something about it.
- We've said that a

03:46.999 --> 03:49.998
million times.
And I didn't want to bring you

03:49.999 --> 03:52.998
the drama, but then I felt like
it was serious yesterday.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.998
Mm-hmm.
That's why I was like, just call

03:54.999 --> 03:57.998
the police... 'cause either you
save someone's life or he's

03:57.999 --> 04:05.999
bluffing and then you...
You know?

04:12.999 --> 04:15.998
Kokes?
What are you doing?

04:15.999 --> 04:18.998
Just editing.

04:18.999 --> 04:21.998
Oh, no.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.998
- You're really, like...
- Huge. I know.

04:23.999 --> 04:25.998
No, you're actually
not... you're more belly this

04:25.999 --> 04:27.998
- time.
- And butt. I look back at

04:27.999 --> 04:30.998
pictures, and I was so skinny,
just my belly, so...

04:30.999 --> 04:32.998
You think that... you
really weren't.

04:32.999 --> 04:34.998
No, go look, and you'll
like, die.

04:34.999 --> 04:38.998
Kim went with North.
How many months pregnant were

04:38.999 --> 04:41.998
- you there?
- I gave birth the next

04:41.999 --> 04:43.998
week.
To even get up out of bed every

04:43.999 --> 04:46.998
night, I have to be, like...

04:46.999 --> 04:49.998
- It's, like, a full sit-up.
- You can't get the

04:49.999 --> 04:51.998
six-pack now, I don't think.
- No, I know.

04:51.999 --> 04:54.998
God, you were skinny
after North.

04:54.999 --> 04:56.998
Okay, I am supposed to be
writing and you're distracting

04:56.999 --> 04:58.998
me.
I'm googling pictures of you

04:58.999 --> 05:00.998
pregnant... like, this is...
you're not helping me.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.998
How is your
book-writing?

05:02.999 --> 05:03.999
I mean, it's very
time-consuming, and I have to...

05:04.000 --> 05:05.998
So time-consuming,
right?

05:05.999 --> 05:07.998
Read everything to
make sure, 'cause they keep,

05:07.999 --> 05:10.998
like, adding things that I don't
want added.

05:10.999 --> 05:13.999
I am writing a book, and it's
Strong Looks Better

05:14.000 --> 05:17.998
and it's really about
being strong... mind, body and

05:17.999 --> 05:20.998
soul.
And I really enjoy writing the

05:20.999 --> 05:23.998
book, but I have so much going
on, I'm so overwhelmed.

05:23.999 --> 05:29.998
And my book has a release date
that's been highly publicized,

05:29.999 --> 05:33.998
so I cannot push back that
release date.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.998
Hi. They took care of

05:36.999 --> 05:41.998
it.
Stop!

05:41.999 --> 05:45.998
I'd be mortified.
Send me a picture.

05:45.999 --> 05:50.999
Oh, wait...
Yes.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.998
Kim.
You're distracting the writing

05:53.999 --> 05:58.998
- process.
- Definitely do it. Bye.

05:58.999 --> 06:01.998
I think you need a dose of fun.
This is, like, taking over your

06:01.999 --> 06:03.998
- life.
- It is, but I have... I

06:03.999 --> 06:06.998
just want it done.
I want it out of my way, done.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.998
And then we could have all the

06:09.999 --> 06:11.998
- fun in the world.
- I feel you.

06:11.999 --> 06:14.998
I have put
much work into this book.

06:14.999 --> 06:19.998
Like... beyond.
And I had no idea how draining

06:19.999 --> 06:21.998
writing a book is.
So when I do have, like, three

06:21.999 --> 06:25.998
hours to commit to the book, I
need to be laser-focused.

06:25.999 --> 06:28.998
So I need to be antisocial and
really buckle down.

06:28.999 --> 06:30.998
Okay, so should I sit
here and be quiet...

06:30.999 --> 06:31.999
- No.
- And then when you're

06:32.000 --> 06:35.998
ready to have fun...?
'Cause this is really comfy.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.998
I sometimes write in
my bathroom on my vanity.

06:37.999 --> 06:40.998
Do you want to lay in here and
I'll go in there?

06:40.999 --> 06:42.998
I'll just... Okay, you lay
there.

06:42.999 --> 06:50.999
I need to focus.

06:57.999 --> 07:00.998
Hi, guys.
Look at all this stuff.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.998
- Isn't it remarkable?
- I know.

07:02.999 --> 07:05.998
Well, Kylie... she's so excited
to move into her new house.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.998
- I'm excited.
- I'm excited to see how

07:07.999 --> 07:11.998
she moves into her place and
takes care of it by herself...

07:11.999 --> 07:14.998
- and learns how to run a home.
- How exciting.

07:14.999 --> 07:15.999
- I know.
- You're gonna get a kick

07:16.000 --> 07:17.998
out of this.
We have a couple of interesting

07:17.999 --> 07:19.998
products.
So, you'll notice here, we call

07:19.999 --> 07:21.998
- this the "Luminous." A-And...
- Oh, that's so pretty.

07:21.999 --> 07:23.998
- Feel this.
- Yeah.

07:23.999 --> 07:25.998
Isn't that a cool texture?

07:25.999 --> 07:27.998
- This one.
- Yeah.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.998
- We need that.
- You guys are getting

07:29.999 --> 07:31.998
- me so excited.
- I'm excited for you.

07:31.999 --> 07:33.998
- Me, too.
- You're a big girl!

07:33.999 --> 07:35.998
- My baby.
- I'm a big girl now.

07:35.999 --> 07:37.998
- Yeah.
- My house is almost

07:37.999 --> 07:41.998
finished up, and the last thing
I really wanted to do was go to

07:41.999 --> 07:46.998
Toto and get a few things.
It is nice to just have my own

07:46.999 --> 07:48.998
place.
I'm excited about it.

07:48.999 --> 07:51.998
So, have you decided
when you get your new toilets

07:51.999 --> 07:54.998
who's gonna clean them?
Is it gonna be you?

07:54.999 --> 07:57.998
Well... yes!

07:57.999 --> 07:59.998
Where are the ones that
warm up and...

07:59.999 --> 08:00.999
Oh, let's go look at that.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.998
- Practically...
- Yeah, right over here.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.998
Answer your e-mails
for you?

08:04.999 --> 08:05.999
Let's come in here for
a second, we're gonna walk into

08:06.000 --> 08:08.998
the bathroom.
What I was gonna show you, how

08:08.999 --> 08:13.998
when you turn this on that wand
come out... and spray.

08:13.999 --> 08:15.998
When you turn the position, move
it in, move it out...

08:15.999 --> 08:18.998
I feel like I'm at the
gynecologist's office.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.998
- Oscillate.
- Oh, my.

08:20.999 --> 08:22.998
When you get up and
walk away from using the

08:22.999 --> 08:26.998
bathroom, you've never been so
clean.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.998
That's amazing.
Two of those, please.

08:28.999 --> 08:31.998
Next time, Kylie, you can come
shopping all by yourself.

08:31.999 --> 08:37.998
All right, bye, guys.♪ ♪

08:37.999 --> 08:39.998
- Hey, guys.
- Bring the light around

08:39.999 --> 08:42.998
just a little bit.
Take a small step backwards.

08:42.999 --> 08:45.998
Like... Yeah, there you go.
That's it, great. Right there.

08:45.999 --> 08:48.998

Nice. That's it.
Okay. Beautiful.

Very nice.
Perfect.

08:57.999 --> 09:00.998
Are those yours?

09:00.999 --> 09:02.998
- Those are all mine.
- Hi.

09:02.999 --> 09:03.999
- Hey, Kim.
- What are you shooting

09:04.000 --> 09:05.998
for?
Evening Standard

09:05.999 --> 09:09.998
- magazine in London.
- Is it about business?

09:09.999 --> 09:10.999
- Yes, it is.
- Good.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.998
That's what the
interview's all about that I'm

09:12.999 --> 09:15.998
- doing next, downstairs.
- Oh, fab.

09:15.999 --> 09:16.999
Aren't those shoes great?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.998
- Yeah.
- Look at the ones I have

09:18.999 --> 09:20.998
- on.
- Very cool.

09:20.999 --> 09:22.998
You should have told me you were
buying equipment... I have all

09:22.999 --> 09:25.998
that equipment and I'm selling
all my equipment.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.998
But I said can we use
it, and you said you didn't want

09:28.999 --> 09:31.998
to separate any of the equipment
'cause you wanted to keep it all

09:31.999 --> 09:34.998
together and perfect, so when
you put it back in your gym...

09:34.999 --> 09:36.998
- Remember? I asked you?
- Yeah, but I'm selling

09:36.999 --> 09:42.998
all of mine, 'cause I want light
gray instead of black.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.998
All right, I'm gonna go
shoot this.

09:44.999 --> 09:49.998
All right. I feel bad.
Wait, can I tell you what's so

09:49.999 --> 09:50.999
annoying?
I just have to say it one last

09:51.000 --> 09:53.998
time and then I won't say it
ever again?

09:53.999 --> 09:55.998
- What?
- So, one of my bathrooms

09:55.999 --> 09:58.998
has to be different, because you
took my ten marble slabs.

09:58.999 --> 10:02.998
I need to now buy seven slabs of
marble, or I have to change two

10:02.999 --> 10:05.998
of my bathrooms, 'cause I can't
have my whole house be one

10:05.999 --> 10:07.998
marble and then two rooms
another marble.

10:07.999 --> 10:11.998
When we moved in with my mom the
first time, we bought a whole

10:11.999 --> 10:14.998
ton of marble... all these slabs
from out of the country.

10:14.999 --> 10:18.998
Then she took my marble, has
never mentioned it, has never

10:18.999 --> 10:22.998
paid for it, and... now I have
to figure out a new plan.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.998
- Kim... let me...
- No, I'm just saying.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.998
- No. No. No.
- No, I'm just saying.

10:26.999 --> 10:29.998
I went to your house to
see what you were talking about.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.998
I had to change Kanye's
whole bathroom...

10:31.999 --> 10:34.998
Really? Really?
Because you didn't have one slab

10:34.999 --> 10:35.999
- of marble?
- No, no, no, we needed

10:36.000 --> 10:37.998
- ten and you took ten.
- I took six.

10:37.999 --> 10:38.999
- In the United States...
- No, ten.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.998
- Six.
- They just sent me the

10:40.999 --> 10:42.999
- invoice today... you took ten.
- You're charging me for

10:43.000 --> 10:44.998
- the marble?
- Absolutely.

10:44.999 --> 10:50.998
- My marble cost me $1 million.
- This whole situation is

10:50.999 --> 10:53.998
ridiculous.
And had I known Kim wanted to

10:53.999 --> 10:57.998
charge me for marble, then I
would have made other decisions

10:57.999 --> 11:00.998
in the first place.
I'm really getting frustrated

11:00.999 --> 11:03.998
with the lack of communication
with my family.

11:03.999 --> 11:05.998
They don't have that
same marble.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.998
I have Calcutta Gold.
It's only from Italy.

They do not have Calcutta Gold

wait.

How much will you give
me if I find you ten slabs of

11:13.999 --> 11:16.998
- Calcutta Gold?
- $1 million. 'Cause I've

11:16.999 --> 11:18.998
- asked every slab...
- Okay.

11:18.999 --> 11:21.998

- $1 million. $1 million.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.998

of that bathroom.

11:25.999 --> 11:30.998
- I will find you ten slabs.
- They don't have it.

have a housewarming party.

- Because I cussed him

bad.

That was the best New Year's Day

20:17.999 --> 20:20.998

- So, you guys, I want to

20:20.999 --> 20:25.998
set up a meeting with this
communication professional to go

20:25.999 --> 20:30.998
over always being on our phones.
And I found this really great

20:30.999 --> 20:32.998
person that Kourtney actually
found.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.998
Wait, a meeting about
always being on our phones?

20:34.999 --> 20:37.998
- Yeah, what?
- Yeah. You're never not

20:37.999 --> 20:41.998
on your phone.
I'm so sick and tired of them

20:41.999 --> 20:46.998
not listening, having Khloe
telling me to cancel events.

20:46.999 --> 20:48.998
As her manager, it's not
professional.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.998
So I decided to let Kourtney set
us up with her friend Erica.

20:51.999 --> 20:54.998
It's like you don't listen, not
one of you.

20:54.999 --> 20:58.998
And I think we all have to have
a powwow about communication.

20:58.999 --> 21:01.998
My friend from
college is a communication

21:01.999 --> 21:04.998
expert.
This is one of the topics that

21:04.999 --> 21:07.998
- she talks about.
- If this girl can talk

21:07.999 --> 21:10.998
some sense into you and your
sisters and your brother, then

21:10.999 --> 21:13.998
hallelujah.
A communications meeting is

21:13.999 --> 21:17.998
going to be a great tool for
them to be in the moment, pay

21:17.999 --> 21:20.998
attention and not yell at me
anymore.

21:20.999 --> 21:22.998
I think that we're missing a lot
of really great moments with

21:22.999 --> 21:24.998
- each other.
- That's the dumbest thing

21:24.999 --> 21:26.998
- I've ever heard in my life.
- I'm always the one

21:26.999 --> 21:28.998
that tells you, "Put your phone
down, we're at dinner."

21:28.999 --> 21:31.998
I think if you guys
were to give it a chance and

21:31.999 --> 21:33.998
come see what I'm talking about,
you might get some real good out

21:33.999 --> 21:36.998
of it.
It's like a little workshop.

21:36.999 --> 21:39.998
- Would that... An activity.
- I really don't get

21:39.999 --> 21:42.998
you... you know how stressed out
I've been, writing my book.

21:42.999 --> 21:45.998
And you want to add one more
thing to my list?

21:45.999 --> 21:48.998
Just listen to what the
woman has to say and maybe

21:48.999 --> 21:56.998
you'll take away one positive
thing from the experience.

21:56.999 --> 21:59.998
- What do you think?
- Sure.

21:59.999 --> 22:01.998
Mm-hmm, that means
"sure".

22:01.999 --> 22:03.998
I just said sure, I'll
go, I don't know how else you

22:03.999 --> 22:06.998
- want me to go.
- Kim?

22:06.999 --> 22:08.998
- I'm down.
- Okay.

22:08.999 --> 22:11.998
At least come with a good
attitude.

22:11.999 --> 22:15.999
- Bye, guys.
- Whack job.

22:20.999 --> 22:23.998
How was the rest of her night?

22:23.999 --> 22:25.998
- Who?
Kennys... I saw...

22:25.999 --> 22:27.998
I did not see her.
Kendall sat with them the entire

22:27.999 --> 22:30.998
dinner.
Then all of us literally

22:30.999 --> 22:33.998
finished eating, JJ went to go
check on her and JJ never came

22:33.999 --> 22:35.998
back, so ten minutes later I
went, and I'm like, "The cars

22:35.999 --> 22:37.998
are outside, we're ready to go,
we all want to go to Nice Guy,

22:37.999 --> 22:39.998
let's hit it."
Yeah.

22:39.999 --> 22:42.998
And she goes, "Get
another car, Kylie."

22:42.999 --> 22:45.998
And I was like, "Okay", like,
it's Haley's birthday."

22:45.999 --> 22:47.998
Oh, the teenage drams.

22:47.999 --> 22:51.998
- So much teenage drams.
- Yes.

22:51.999 --> 22:56.998
So exciting.
Um, okay, housewarming party...

22:56.999 --> 22:59.998
what are we gonna do?
We need to, like, make this the

22:59.999 --> 23:06.998
ultimate housewarming party.
Like, what about if we get,

23:06.999 --> 23:09.998
like, flowers on your table and
you need, like, we need to light

23:09.999 --> 23:13.998
all the candles and we need...
Let's, like, make a slide from

23:13.999 --> 23:16.998
your hill, like, going into the
pool.

23:16.999 --> 23:19.998
Like, I'm, like, living my life
though you.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.998
Um, we need to get the dogs,
like, have them go, like, on a

23:23.999 --> 23:25.998
- vacation for the day.
- A vacation for the

23:25.999 --> 23:27.998
- day?
- Yeah.

23:27.999 --> 23:30.998
I just wanted like,
simplicity and I just kind of

23:30.999 --> 23:34.998
- wanted to do it my way.
- But my way is the

23:34.999 --> 23:36.998
- best way.
- I know, but I have to

23:36.999 --> 23:41.998
learn to have my own way.
I just feel like I want to do

23:41.999 --> 23:43.998
- something low-key.
- As long as you get

23:43.999 --> 23:46.998
- my approval.
- I don't know how many

23:46.999 --> 23:50.998
times I have to say I'm grown
now, I'm 18, I can handle this

23:50.999 --> 23:53.998
on my own.
Sometimes, with my family, it's

23:53.999 --> 23:59.998
just easier to nod your head and
brush things off your shoulder.

23:59.999 --> 24:07.998
Honestly, I don't even know if I
want to do it anymore.

24:07.999 --> 24:10.998
Kourtney's been over and she's,
like, been rearranging all my

24:10.999 --> 24:13.998
furniture and trying to tell me,
like, how to do my house.

24:13.999 --> 24:15.998
It's your decision,
it's your house, it's your

24:15.999 --> 24:17.998
money, it's your area.
Do what you want.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.999
- Yeah.
- Tell one thing that

24:21.000 --> 24:23.998
- you appreciate about them.
- Khloe, I feel like

24:23.999 --> 24:26.998
you're always in a good mood.
Not really... lately you've been

24:26.999 --> 24:30.998
a little cranky.
Clearly, Khloe has been stressed

24:30.999 --> 24:32.999
out.

24:44.999 --> 24:48.998
- Hello?
- Hey, Daddy-O.

24:48.999 --> 24:51.998
Hey, babe.
Oh, you know what, I was just

24:51.999 --> 24:53.998
- going to call you.
- Cute.

24:53.999 --> 24:55.998
I r... Honestly, I
just picked up the phone and I

24:55.999 --> 24:57.998
was saying, "I got to call
Kylie."

24:57.999 --> 24:59.998
- What's up?
- Um, yeah, I just

24:59.999 --> 25:04.998
wanted to talk to you because
Kourtney and Mom have been just,

25:04.999 --> 25:06.998
like...
I don't know what the right word

25:06.999 --> 25:10.998
is... maybe, like, invasive or,
like, pushy, kind of, about my

25:10.999 --> 25:13.998
housewarming party.
Kourtney's been over and she's,

25:13.999 --> 25:16.998
like, been rearranging all my
furniture and trying to tell me,

25:16.999 --> 25:22.998
like, how to do my house and I
kind of wanted to do this, like,

25:22.999 --> 25:25.999
on my own, you know, and have
that experience.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.998
I don't blame you.
All right, here's the deal...

25:28.999 --> 25:31.998
But it's your decision, it's
your house, it's your money,

25:31.999 --> 25:35.998
it's your area.
Do exactly what you want to do.

25:35.999 --> 25:39.998
Yeah, all righty.
I think I'm just gonna take my

25:39.999 --> 25:43.998
dad's advice and just do
whatever I want to do, 'cause

25:43.999 --> 25:48.998
it's my housewarming party and
it's gonna be done how Kylie

25:48.999 --> 25:51.998
- house parties are gonna be done.
- Anyway, good, what

25:51.999 --> 25:53.998
else is going on... anything
exciting?

25:53.999 --> 25:56.998
Yeah, I did a photo shoot today.

25:56.999 --> 25:58.998
- Rocking it, girl.
- It was pretty cool.

25:58.999 --> 26:01.998
I had this cute little love
interest.

26:01.999 --> 26:04.998
Good.
Good, all right.

26:04.999 --> 26:09.998
- Okay, love you.
- Love you, bye!

26:09.999 --> 26:17.999
Bye.♪ ♪

26:20.999 --> 26:23.998
Mom is so annoying.
Did you guys see her outfit

26:23.999 --> 26:25.998
- today?
- No, what is she

26:25.999 --> 26:27.998
- wearing?
- My Balmain outfit that

26:27.999 --> 26:30.998
she took from me with a thin,
black velvet choker.

26:30.999 --> 26:32.998
Are you pissed or happy?

26:32.999 --> 26:34.998
- Fuming.
- Where is Mom?

26:34.999 --> 26:35.999
Mom and I planned this.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.998
So then why is Mom not
here, though?

26:37.999 --> 26:39.998
- Yeah.
- Mom flew off to

26:39.999 --> 26:42.998
- Paris.
- Shocker that she's

26:42.999 --> 26:45.998
making us do this.
My mom forgot to communicate

26:45.999 --> 26:47.998
with herself that she had a
appointment.

26:47.999 --> 26:50.998
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

26:50.999 --> 26:51.999
Khloe and Kim are here.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.998
She's a no-show for
her own communication meeting

26:54.999 --> 26:58.998
- that she orchestrated.
- Okay, so your mama and

26:58.999 --> 27:01.998
Kourtney both call... well, we
met, when, like, a couple weeks

27:01.999 --> 27:05.998
ago, to dine and discuss
communication issues.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.998
Also work on putting the phones
away, which...

27:07.999 --> 27:08.999
- Yeah.
- Oh, like she's one to

27:09.000 --> 27:10.998
- talk.
- I know.

27:10.999 --> 27:13.998
We could start with a little
exercise... I want you to...

27:13.999 --> 27:16.998
for... so Khloe, let's say you
start and you tell Kim and

27:16.999 --> 27:18.998
Kourtney one thing that you
appreciate about them,

27:18.999 --> 27:22.998
- internally.
- I appreciate your...

27:22.999 --> 27:26.998
- ability to be so honest.
- That could be a good

27:26.999 --> 27:27.999
- thing or a bad thing.
- Yeah, I was gonna

27:28.000 --> 27:29.998
- say it depends what it is.
- I appreciate it.

27:29.999 --> 27:35.998
What I love about you is your
strength as, like, a mother just

27:35.999 --> 27:37.998
to, like, hold everything
together.

27:37.999 --> 27:40.998
- Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Your turn.

27:40.999 --> 27:44.998
I would say Kim's
ability, like, to do it all.

27:44.999 --> 27:47.998
Mm-hmm, yeah.
- It is a good one.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.998
Khloe, I admire,
like, just, like, your energy.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.998
- Thank you.
- You definitely live

27:52.999 --> 27:54.998
in the moment.
Like, what we're... been talking

27:54.999 --> 27:57.998
about, to be present.
Like, you're definitely present

27:57.999 --> 27:59.998
in, like, whatever situation
you're at.

27:59.999 --> 28:02.998
I feel like you're always in a
good mood.

28:02.999 --> 28:07.998
Not really... lately you've been
a little cranky.

28:07.999 --> 28:12.998
Clearly Khloe has been totally
inconsistent lately and, like,

28:12.999 --> 28:15.998
stressed out, because she's a
workaholic.

28:15.999 --> 28:19.998
And I want her to be happy.
Nobody wants her to feel burned

28:19.999 --> 28:24.998
- out.
- You're writing this book

28:24.999 --> 28:26.998
and it has to be true.
It's, like, about mind, body and

28:26.999 --> 28:29.998
- soul, so you have to live it.
- When do we ever live

28:29.999 --> 28:31.998
- it?
- You just need to take

28:31.999 --> 28:35.998
- some time for you.
- Oh, no, no, not on her

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
beautiful chairs!
This sucks.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.998
- It's only guacamole.
- I can get guacamole

28:40.999 --> 28:42.000
up your vagina right now.

28:50.999 --> 28:53.998
What kind of cookie
should I have, iced oatmeal?

28:53.999 --> 28:56.998
That's the last one I
would choose.

28:56.999 --> 28:59.998
- Uh... terrible.
- This one's not that icy.

28:59.999 --> 29:03.998
You can't touch them all.

29:03.999 --> 29:06.998
Mmm, but these ones are
so good, though.

29:06.999 --> 29:08.998
They are, I haven't
had one in so long.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.998
How is the book coming along?

29:11.999 --> 29:15.998
Just...
It's, like, the most annoying

29:15.999 --> 29:18.998
- thing ever, is to write a book.
- Yeah.

29:18.999 --> 29:21.998
And Mom goes, "Why do
you have to read it so many

29:21.999 --> 29:24.998
times?"
I said, "'Cause every time I

29:24.999 --> 29:29.998
write something, like, they
"change it, so, yeah, I have to

29:29.999 --> 29:31.998
read every single edit... the
"whole thing... from start to

29:31.999 --> 29:34.998
finish, every time, because who
"knows what they're s... like,

29:34.999 --> 29:37.998
sinking in there."
I just feel super overwhelmed

29:37.999 --> 29:42.998
with just, like, everything.
Like, just the traveling for

29:42.999 --> 29:45.998
Kardashian Kollection and
Kardashian Kids and, like, DASH

29:45.999 --> 29:47.998
and then a book writing and then
that and then a stupid photo

29:47.999 --> 29:49.998
shoots and, like, just
everything.

29:49.999 --> 29:53.998
It's, like, one too many things.

29:53.999 --> 29:57.998
Well, I think you are
definitely overwhelmed.

29:57.999 --> 29:59.998
You're writing this book and it
has to be true.

29:59.999 --> 30:03.998
It's, like, about mind, body and
soul, so you have to live it.

30:03.999 --> 30:05.998
When do we ever live it?

30:05.999 --> 30:09.998
Living what you're writing.

30:09.999 --> 30:12.998
I think Khloe needs to really
start living in the moment and

30:12.999 --> 30:16.998
really living the truth of what
she is writing about in this

30:16.999 --> 30:19.998
book, and just I think it's time
for her to focus on the project

30:19.999 --> 30:22.998
she's really passionate about so
she isn't spread too thin.

30:22.999 --> 30:26.998
I think sometimes we just get so
busy that we put so much energy

30:26.999 --> 30:29.998
into the negative instead of
just being productive.

30:29.999 --> 30:35.999
You just need to take some time
for you.

30:42.999 --> 30:46.998
Oh, this is where
you want to sit?

30:46.999 --> 30:48.998
- What a pretty view.
- I know, we sit out

30:48.999 --> 30:50.998
here and have breakfast
sometimes.

30:50.999 --> 30:52.998
This is how I sit having
breakfast with Kanye... I like to

30:52.999 --> 30:54.998
- sit next to him.
- I like sitting

30:54.999 --> 30:58.998
- across.
- Aah! It's a spider!

30:58.999 --> 31:00.998
- What?
- Get it the off

31:00.999 --> 31:02.998
me.
Why was that on your face?

31:02.999 --> 31:05.998
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.998
- What kind was it?
- I don't know, but I

31:07.999 --> 31:09.998
never would have grabbed it had
I known it was a spider.

31:09.999 --> 31:12.998
A little bit scared.

31:12.999 --> 31:14.998
How annoying was that
that Mom didn't even show up to

31:14.999 --> 31:17.998
our communication thing that she
set up?

31:17.999 --> 31:19.998
- Ultra annoying.
- So rude.

31:19.999 --> 31:21.998
And so weird.
Like, Mom...

31:21.999 --> 31:23.998
- What's that?
- Feel like she just

31:23.999 --> 31:25.998
wants us to be off of our
phones.

31:25.999 --> 31:27.998
Yeah.
We need to tell her, like,

31:27.999 --> 31:30.998
things that we had to do in that
class that she forced us to

31:30.999 --> 31:32.998
- do...
- Forced us to do.

31:32.999 --> 31:35.998
- And make her do them.
- Something to where we

31:35.999 --> 31:39.998
just, like, kind of, like, mock
her.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.998
I think my mom was trying to
blame things on us to make it

31:41.999 --> 31:46.998
seem like we're so disconnected
and always on our phones when I

31:46.999 --> 31:48.998
think she's a little bit more
disconnected.

31:48.999 --> 31:51.998
As our manager, I think she
should let us know when she's

31:51.999 --> 31:54.998
gonna go travel the world, and
she needs to learn a lesson

31:54.999 --> 31:56.998
that, you know, at least we're
all communicating with each

31:56.999 --> 31:58.998
other.
Should we put her in a dunk

31:58.999 --> 32:01.998
tank, and say that that is,
like, one of our requests?

32:01.999 --> 32:03.998
- Trust?
- Yeah, like a trust

32:03.999 --> 32:04.999
- thing?
- Yeah, but where on

32:05.000 --> 32:06.998
- earth do you get a dunk tank?
- I don't know.

32:06.999 --> 32:09.998
We'll rent one.
Let's call her.

32:09.999 --> 32:12.998
Hi.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.998
- Hey, Mom.
- What's up, honey?

32:14.999 --> 32:18.998
Um, so you know how
you missed our exercises with

32:18.999 --> 32:21.998
- Erica?
- Yeah.

32:21.999 --> 32:23.998
She thought it would be
good to do them all together

32:23.999 --> 32:25.998
- with you, too.
- Oh, lucky me.

32:25.999 --> 32:27.998
Well, you set it up.
What do you mean lucky you?

32:27.999 --> 32:29.998
Yeah, you're the
one who wanted to do this in the

32:29.999 --> 32:31.998
first place.
I'm shocked that you're not,

32:31.999 --> 32:34.998
- like, dying to do it.
- No, I am excited.

32:34.999 --> 32:36.998
I'm excited to see what she had
to say.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.998
Okay, so we're gonna do it...

32:38.999 --> 32:40.998
We'll set it up.
Like, when we get, like, Khloe

32:40.999 --> 32:42.998
here and everything, we'll all
do it together.

32:42.999 --> 32:45.998
All right, well, I have
another call holding.

32:45.999 --> 32:47.999
- Can I call you guys right back?
- No need.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.998
Nothing pleasures me

32:52.999 --> 32:57.998
more than, like, pranking my
mom, and we are gonna let my mom

32:57.999 --> 32:59.999
know that she is no better than
we are.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.998
There are consequences for her
missing the communication

33:02.999 --> 33:06.998
- session.
- Where does this go?

33:06.999 --> 33:08.998
What are you guys doing?

33:08.999 --> 33:10.998
So, since you
missed the communication thing,

33:10.999 --> 33:12.998
you get a choice.
You get to either...

33:12.999 --> 33:14.998
- A choice?
- Sit in that

33:14.999 --> 33:17.998
thing, and we get to throw
something at that target, or the

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
surprise.

33:33.999 --> 33:40.998
Hey.

33:40.999 --> 33:43.998
Oh, look at the
wallpaper up there.

33:43.999 --> 33:47.998
- What's going on?
- Wanted to see you guys

33:47.999 --> 33:50.998
and host a cute dinner.
Cute. What is this?

33:50.999 --> 33:52.998
It's a diffuser, so you can...

33:52.999 --> 33:54.998
Cute. Does it have
little things in it?

33:54.999 --> 33:56.998
- Yeah. Where are they?
- She's a regifter.

33:56.999 --> 33:58.998
- White cake?
- Hi, baby!

33:58.999 --> 34:00.998
I know.
It's everything.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.998
- What's happening?
- Hi, baby.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.998
You guys, this is so cute!

34:04.999 --> 34:07.998
No one's really been at my
house together.

34:07.999 --> 34:11.998
I'm super excited about my
housewarming party, and I

34:11.999 --> 34:15.998
decided I'd invite everyone
the day of the party, and just

34:15.999 --> 34:19.998
kind of wanted this one to be
all me, and not worry about

34:19.999 --> 34:22.999
other opinions.
Hopefully, they just enjoy

34:23.000 --> 34:26.998
themselves and think that I am a
good hostess.

34:26.999 --> 34:28.998
She did such a beautiful job.

34:28.999 --> 34:29.999
- Cute!
- She got our favorite

34:30.000 --> 34:31.998
food.
Where did these come from?

34:31.999 --> 34:33.998
- I love these.
- Kourtney Kardashian.

34:33.999 --> 34:35.998
- I skipped...
- Those are really...

34:35.999 --> 34:36.999
- I have these in gold.
- I bought these for

34:37.000 --> 34:38.998
- her.
- Kylie, where did you

34:38.999 --> 34:40.998
- get these flowers from?
- Tyga. He gives me

34:40.999 --> 34:42.998
- flowers, like, every day.
- That's so nice.

34:42.999 --> 34:44.998
I will say, your house has
turned out so good.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.998
It's so good.

34:46.999 --> 34:47.999
- So cute.
- It is. I love it.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.998
- Yeah.
- It has good vibes.

34:49.999 --> 34:53.998
I just wanted to say...

34:53.999 --> 34:56.998
thank you guys for coming, and I
appreciate it.

34:56.999 --> 34:58.998
And I didn't expect any
housewarming presents.

34:58.999 --> 35:00.998
Aren't you happy?

35:00.999 --> 35:02.998
Yeah.

35:02.999 --> 35:04.998
I'm so proud of Kylie.

35:04.999 --> 35:07.998
She's, like, such a little
grown-up, and I feel like she

35:07.999 --> 35:11.998
really got the skills about,
like, hosting and how to keep

35:11.999 --> 35:15.998
your household, and I'll back
off and let her, you know, take

35:15.999 --> 35:18.998
- charge of her own house.
- Yum. This is good luck.

35:18.999 --> 35:21.998
Your first piece of cake in your
house.

35:21.999 --> 35:22.999
I didn't put it on my rolls.
It's so good.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.998
That's a step.
Just clean.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.998
- It's so good.
- Good. Clean.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.998
Pardon me.

35:28.999 --> 35:30.998
- Shut up.
- Oh, my God.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.998
- Shut up.
- I have to go out

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999
tonight, so please don't do that
to me.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.998
Oh, no. No!
Not on her beautiful chairs!

35:38.999 --> 35:41.998
Oh, my God, you guys, look what
you're doing!

35:41.999 --> 35:43.998
- You can't clean this up.
- Oh, my God.

35:43.999 --> 35:46.998
Oh!

35:46.999 --> 35:50.998
You can not clean this.
There is guacamole all over your

35:50.999 --> 35:51.999
- shoes, all the guacamole.
- I'm gonna get

35:52.000 --> 35:55.998
- guacamole up your vagina.
- What is going on...

35:55.999 --> 35:57.998
- right now?
- Spread your legs.

35:57.999 --> 35:59.998
Not the best choice of
a chair if you can't clean it.

35:59.999 --> 36:01.998
- Spread your legs.
- Got to stop with the

36:01.999 --> 36:03.998
- guac.
- Look what you did to

36:03.999 --> 36:04.999
- this chair.
- Tell her to spread

36:05.000 --> 36:06.998
- her legs.
- She's very excited

36:06.999 --> 36:08.998
- about the...
- See that knife

36:08.999 --> 36:10.998
- right there?
- No.

36:10.999 --> 36:12.998
It's literally going up your.

36:12.999 --> 36:14.998
Kourtney, someone just
help me with the dog.

36:14.999 --> 36:16.998
What do you want in
your vodka drink, Mom?

36:16.999 --> 36:17.999
Just nothing.
It's fine just with some ice.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.998
You are
the biggest whore on the planet.

36:20.999 --> 36:24.998
- Khloe!
- It's a unicorn!

36:24.999 --> 36:29.998
- It is a unicorn! Oh!
- Well, I'm glad I threw

36:29.999 --> 36:33.998
really mature.

36:33.999 --> 36:35.998
Ooh, you look like
Chiquita Banana!

36:35.999 --> 36:37.998
But I don't know about

36:37.999 --> 36:40.998
- them so much.
- Oh, she scared you.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.998
- You guys.
- What?

36:42.999 --> 36:45.998
Kylie, we just blessed your
house.

36:45.999 --> 36:48.998
And you're welcome.
We just blessed your house.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.998
Avocado is good for your hair.

36:51.999 --> 36:53.998
I don't think sour cream is.

36:53.999 --> 36:56.998
I think I got it all
over my blazer, which is really

36:56.999 --> 36:58.998
- bad.
- Kylie's like, "Get

36:58.999 --> 37:06.999
the out of my house."

37:08.999 --> 37:11.998
Khlo?
Congrats...

37:11.999 --> 37:13.998
- Thank you.
- On finishing

37:13.999 --> 37:15.998
- your book.
- Thank you.

37:15.999 --> 37:18.998
I'm so excited for you.

37:18.999 --> 37:20.998
- Oh.
- I feel so sick.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.998
Wait. Are you,
like, fully done?

37:22.999 --> 37:24.999
- Yeah. I mean...
- I'm gonna start

37:25.000 --> 37:29.998
making vichy while we're talking
because I have to go home.

37:29.999 --> 37:31.998
I'm going on my book tour.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.998
Gonna be gone for two and a half
weeks.

37:33.999 --> 37:37.998
Where's the
non-Teflon stuff?

37:37.999 --> 37:39.998
This copper, I think, is not
Teflon.

37:39.999 --> 37:41.998
What does it talk about?

37:41.999 --> 37:43.998
Just about, just
'cause you're going through a

37:43.999 --> 37:45.998
hard time in your life doesn't
mean you have to, like, break

37:45.999 --> 37:47.998
and crumble.
There's so many things to be

37:47.999 --> 37:50.998
thankful for, and just, let's
turn negatives into positives.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.998
When do I get a copy?

37:52.999 --> 37:54.998
I don't know.
It's to the printer now.

37:54.999 --> 37:59.998
Press tour starts November 3,
so, I'm assuming soon.

37:59.999 --> 38:03.998
I feel like I started getting so
consumed with all of the

38:03.999 --> 38:06.998
negatives in my life, and I
started looking at things in

38:06.999 --> 38:09.998
such a negative way, and it was
taking its toll on me.

38:09.999 --> 38:12.998
And once I actually refocused
myself, I finally finished my

38:12.999 --> 38:15.998
book.
And from writing my book, it's

38:15.999 --> 38:20.998
become so therapeutic, making me
actually live what I'm writing.

38:20.999 --> 38:25.998
Feel like I'm getting back into
the positive mind-body-soul.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.998
- What is that?
- Cream.

38:27.999 --> 38:30.998
No.
Kourtney, is this milk?

38:30.999 --> 38:33.998
It's milk, and
cream is at the top, naturally.

38:33.999 --> 38:37.998
- That looks so...
- That is kind of nasty.

38:37.999 --> 38:39.998
Disgusting.
I only drink almond milk, so

38:39.999 --> 38:41.998
- what do I do then?
- You don't have

38:41.999 --> 38:43.998
- cream.
- Good.

38:43.999 --> 38:44.999
But you should make
your own almond milk.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.998
- Oh, really?
- You should actually

38:46.999 --> 38:50.998
have somebody make it for you.
It takes five minutes.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.999
God, she is wild.

39:01.999 --> 39:03.998
Can't believe Khloe
is sick and missing our

39:03.999 --> 39:07.998
pie-making.
- I know.

39:07.999 --> 39:09.998
A pie is so much easier to make
than I thought.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.998
If you buy the crust.

39:11.999 --> 39:14.998
- Yeah.
- You want a cherry?

39:14.999 --> 39:17.998
- Or sprinkles?
- Sprinkles! Yes!

39:17.999 --> 39:20.998
Extra creamy for this one.

39:20.999 --> 39:26.998
Mom's in for a big surprise.
Kim and I are doing a little fun

39:26.999 --> 39:29.998
prank on my mom because she
didn't show up at the

39:29.999 --> 39:32.999
communication session that she
set up.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.998
Okay. We're done.
We all have communication issues

39:37.999 --> 39:42.998
in our family, so, we are just
gonna test her and really prove

39:42.999 --> 39:45.998
to her that she is a huge part
of the problem herself.

39:45.999 --> 39:47.998
- So...
- Did you start

39:47.999 --> 39:49.998
- decorating?
- Not really.

39:49.999 --> 39:50.999
I just pulled out a couple
things.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.998
- Oh, okay.
- Hi. Where does this...

39:52.999 --> 39:54.998
- Where does this go?
- Okay. So...

39:54.999 --> 39:56.998
What are you guys doing?

39:56.999 --> 39:59.998
- You have an option.
- Wait. So, I'm here to

39:59.999 --> 40:02.998
do the communications thing, so
what's all of this?

40:02.999 --> 40:05.998
So, since you
missed the communication thing

40:05.999 --> 40:10.998
last time, you clearly need to
know how to communicate with

40:10.999 --> 40:13.998
your children.
You get a choice.

40:13.999 --> 40:15.998
- You get to either...
- A choice?

40:15.999 --> 40:16.999
Sit in that
thing, and we get to throw

40:17.000 --> 40:21.998
something at that target, or you
can have option B, which is a

40:21.999 --> 40:24.998
- surprise.
- You guys are the ones

40:24.999 --> 40:26.998
who needed the communications
session.

40:26.999 --> 40:28.998
I'm fine with how I communicate
with people.

40:28.999 --> 40:31.998
No. We need to
communicate together, so that's

40:31.999 --> 40:34.998
why people do, like, couples
therapy or things like that, or,

40:34.999 --> 40:37.998
like, family therapy, 'cause
they need to know together.

40:37.999 --> 40:39.998
I don't want to have
couples therapy with you guys.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.998
This meeting that you set up...

40:41.999 --> 40:43.998
And we had our
meeting with Erica.

40:43.999 --> 40:45.998
This was your whole thing.

40:45.999 --> 40:47.998
- Okay, so pick.
- Pick. Which one?

40:47.999 --> 40:50.999
Option one, two or both?

40:56.999 --> 40:59.998
- Okay, so pick.
- Pick. Which one?

40:59.999 --> 41:04.999
- Option one, two or both?
- Is it cash-related?

41:05.000 --> 41:06.998
- Maybe.
- All right, I'll do one

41:06.999 --> 41:08.998
of each.
It's probably throwing up.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.998
Go sit down in the special seat.

41:10.999 --> 41:12.998
- You can do both.
- Okay, what do you want

41:12.999 --> 41:14.998
- me to do?
- Sit down.

41:14.999 --> 41:16.998
This is, like, a
contraption that...

41:16.999 --> 41:22.999
How do I put this
when I'm not tall enough?

41:23.000 --> 41:26.998
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

41:26.999 --> 41:29.998
That's cold!
That is so mean!

41:29.999 --> 41:31.998
- That wasn't...
- That was not very nice!

41:31.999 --> 41:33.998
I was just putting it in.

41:33.999 --> 41:36.998
- My God.
- Wait, don't stop...

41:36.999 --> 41:40.998
- No, I have to go somewhere!
- Oh, I can't... I'm out

41:40.999 --> 41:44.998
- of here.
- I have to go

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
- somewhere.
- Oh, thank God it didn't

41:46.000 --> 41:47.998
pop!

41:47.999 --> 41:49.998
Kim, come back.
We need to do it.

41:49.999 --> 41:52.998
- And she missed!
- Okay.

41:52.999 --> 41:58.998
First question...

41:58.999 --> 42:01.998
- what is my due date?
- December the 24th.

42:01.999 --> 42:05.998
- Nope! Wrong-o!
- What?!

42:05.999 --> 42:09.998
- Uh...
- Kourtney.

42:09.999 --> 42:12.998
Oh, my God!

42:12.999 --> 42:15.998
This is not a fun game!
I don't want to play this

42:15.999 --> 42:17.998
- anymore.
- Okay, wait, what is

42:17.999 --> 42:19.998
- North's middle name?
- South.

42:19.999 --> 42:24.998
Okay, that hurt.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.998
- What is North's middle name?
- North doesn't have a

42:26.999 --> 42:28.998
- middle name!
- Oh.

42:28.999 --> 42:33.998
- Okay, we have one more!
- That was so confusing.

42:33.999 --> 42:37.999
Really? Only my kids would put
me through this kind of torture

42:38.000 --> 42:41.998
- and love it this much.
- How many years has DASH

42:41.999 --> 42:43.998
- been open?
- 16, 17... Wait, hold

42:43.999 --> 42:45.998
on.
Six!

42:45.999 --> 42:47.998
11!

42:47.999 --> 42:49.998
- What?
- 11!

42:49.999 --> 42:51.998
Oh, right! I meant 11!
Okay, I'll go to the next

42:51.999 --> 42:55.998
meeting.
But the truth is they're right,

42:55.999 --> 42:59.998
and I probably could use a
little meeting about our

42:59.999 --> 43:03.998
- communication skills.
- Have a nice day!

43:03.999 --> 43:06.998
Wait! You guys, I can't
see.

43:06.999 --> 43:09.998
- Oh, my gosh.
- Damn it.

43:09.999 --> 43:15.998
I can't see!

43:15.999 --> 43:18.998
On the next episode...

43:18.999 --> 43:22.998
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, my God, you guys are

43:22.999 --> 43:25.998
- all dressed like me.
- This month is crazy

43:25.999 --> 43:27.998
- for birthdays.
- This is so

43:27.999 --> 43:29.998
- intimidating.
- We are recording

43:29.999 --> 43:31.998
the song for my mom's birthday
party.

43:31.999 --> 43:34.998
