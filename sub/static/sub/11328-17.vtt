WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
I miss Mom.

00:04.034 --> 00:05.000
Do you miss Ben? No.

00:05.034 --> 00:06.900
We may have broken up, Amy and me,

00:06.933 --> 00:08.467
<i>but I still care about her.</i>

00:08.501 --> 00:10.501
Jack and I are just
friends and nothing more.

00:10.534 --> 00:12.367
If you really love me, then I wouldn't care

00:12.401 --> 00:15.000
if you spent all the time in
the world with Amy and John

00:15.534 --> 00:17.001
because they wouldn't be a threat to me.

00:17.034 --> 00:18.801
Even though we're just friends now,

00:18.834 --> 00:20.600
I wouldn't want you to have
sex with any other guy.

00:20.634 --> 00:22.400
Without having a boyfriend in my life,

00:22.433 --> 00:25.300
maybe I do have room for
a new friend after all.

00:25.333 --> 00:26.300
Really?

00:26.333 --> 00:27.967
I guess we could try to be friends

00:28.001 --> 00:29.967
anyway, for-- for him.

00:30.001 --> 00:32.201
I was wondering if you'd
like to go out this weekend.

00:32.234 --> 00:33.700
We decided we'd go out.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.001
As long as we're still broken up.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.600
Yeah, we're still broken up.

00:36.634 --> 00:38.534
You're not really her friend.

00:38.567 --> 00:40.801
Yeah. I am really her friend.

00:40.834 --> 00:41.967
You need a boyfriend.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.467
We have to get you a boyfriend.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.767
Memento?

00:44.801 --> 00:45.967
What are you doing here?

00:46.001 --> 00:48.300
I figured you might be happy to see me.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.934
I am happy to see you.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.767
I could take John home after work,

00:51.801 --> 00:53.901
and then we could go out, the two of us.

00:53.934 --> 00:56.168
That sounds good. Let's go.

01:17.067 --> 01:18.567
Oh, brother.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.001
Hi.

01:24.034 --> 01:25.801
Bye.

01:25.834 --> 01:28.067
Uh, I'm going now.

01:28.101 --> 01:29.500
Uh-huh.

01:29.534 --> 01:31.433
Do I look okay? Uh-huh.

01:31.467 --> 01:32.867
Ashley.

01:32.901 --> 01:34.901
Take a condom.

01:34.934 --> 01:35.967
What does that mean?

01:36.001 --> 01:37.001
It's a compliment.

01:37.034 --> 01:38.734
Really? You think this is okay?

01:38.767 --> 01:41.333
Translation of "Take a condom,
" Amy, is you look hot.

01:41.367 --> 01:42.600
Do I?

01:42.634 --> 01:44.268
You're starting to border on needy.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.367
But hot and needy?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.333
They're in my desk drawer. Help yourself.

01:48.367 --> 01:49.934
Maybe I will.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.201
They're for sex, you know.

01:51.234 --> 01:52.201
I know that.

01:52.234 --> 01:53.667
I'm not gonna have sex,

01:53.700 --> 01:56.201
but maybe I'll take one anyway.

01:56.234 --> 01:58.067
That pouch. They're in there.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.333
Oh, that's cute.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.500
It's functional.

02:08.533 --> 02:10.133
Why do you want the condom?

02:10.168 --> 02:11.934
Why do you have condoms?

02:11.967 --> 02:13.234
Well, better safe than you.

02:13.268 --> 02:14.834
That is why I want the condom.

02:14.867 --> 02:16.934
I'm not going to make
that same mistake twice.

02:16.967 --> 02:19.134
Isn't this the second time
you've been out with Jimmy?

02:19.168 --> 02:21.067
Third, if you count the grocery store.

02:21.101 --> 02:22.734
I wouldn't count that if I were you.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.201
Even if it is the third date,

02:24.234 --> 02:25.834
it would be way too soon.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.101
Years too soon.

02:27.134 --> 02:28.901
I'm not going to do anything.

02:28.934 --> 02:31.467
Yeah, pimento, don't forget
who you're talking to.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.367
I thought it would be nice
if I had a condom in my purse

02:34.400 --> 02:35.801
like any other responsible teenager

02:35.834 --> 02:37.268
going out on a date.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.934
I just-- I want to feel normal tonight.

02:38.967 --> 02:40.567
Okay, Amy, seriously,

02:40.600 --> 02:41.801
you're not really thinking

02:41.834 --> 02:43.400
about having sex with this guy, are you?

02:43.433 --> 02:44.600
No, I'm not.

02:44.634 --> 02:45.734
I'm going to take this anyway.

02:45.767 --> 02:47.201
All right. If you do have sex,

02:47.234 --> 02:49.201
I hope you enjoy it this time.

02:49.234 --> 02:50.500
Good night.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.101
Do you know how to use that?

02:53.134 --> 02:54.567
There's instructions on the Internet.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.333
I know how to use it.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.600
Okay, well, just so you know,

02:57.634 --> 02:59.101
it doesn't work from your purse.

02:59.134 --> 03:02.734
I know that. You have to put
it on the banana first, right?

03:02.767 --> 03:03.967
Kidding.

03:04.001 --> 03:07.067
Thanks for that tip and
for saying I look hot.

03:07.101 --> 03:08.201
Means a lot.

03:08.234 --> 03:10.268
Go. You're getting too sisterly now.

03:13.268 --> 03:14.534
Be careful out there.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.101
<i>* Falling in love </i>

03:27.134 --> 03:30.367
<i>* Is such an easy thing to do *</i>

03:30.400 --> 03:33.034
<i>* Birds can do it We can do it *</i>

03:33.067 --> 03:35.567
<i>* Let's stop talking
Let's get to it *</i>

03:35.600 --> 03:37.801
<i>* Let's fall in love </i>

03:47.534 --> 03:49.967
That was the year I made a
calendar for the furniture store.

03:50.001 --> 03:51.433
12 months of me. That was September.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.168
What's September about it?

03:53.201 --> 03:54.534
It's like a back to school shot.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.234
This is before or after you married Mom?

03:56.268 --> 03:58.067
Before. Back when I was managing the store,

03:58.101 --> 03:59.967
before Old Man Miller had sold it to me.

04:00.001 --> 04:01.934
I was working for him
while going to college.

04:01.967 --> 04:03.567
He convinced me I could make a killing.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.901
With your calendar?

04:04.934 --> 04:06.734
Not just with the calendars. With the store.

04:06.767 --> 04:09.367
I may not have made a killing,
but I've had a lot of fun.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.433
Fun? Yeah.

04:11.467 --> 04:13.268
Hey, remember when I
used this picture of you

04:13.300 --> 04:15.268
for the recliner sale? No.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.834
Well, I did. I got a supermodel for free.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.567
You know, I read that letter

04:19.600 --> 04:21.867
where you apologized to Mom
for some chick named Rita.

04:21.901 --> 04:23.067
Where's that one?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.201
Oh, yeah. Lovely Rita Meter Maid.

04:29.234 --> 04:31.834
"Come on, Raggedy Anne,
I wasn't doing anything.

04:31.867 --> 04:33.201
"Rita means nothing to me.

04:33.234 --> 04:34.500
"She's just a customer.

04:34.534 --> 04:35.767
"She came in the store,

04:35.801 --> 04:37.134
and she was testing the mattress--"

04:38.567 --> 04:40.634
"I just laid down next to her to be funny.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.467
"You call me your funny
man because I'm funny.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.400
It was a joke. I love you. Call me."

04:45.634 --> 04:47.333
I left this on her dorm room door

04:47.367 --> 04:49.067
with some flowers-- roses.

04:49.101 --> 04:50.767
Oh, wait a minute.

04:50.801 --> 04:52.234
Gladiolas.

04:52.268 --> 04:54.268
Gladiolas? Because you were so cheap?

04:54.300 --> 04:56.767
I was saving to buy her a ring. Gladiolas.

04:56.801 --> 04:58.534
She liked them. She told me

04:58.567 --> 05:00.034
that gladiolas were totally underrated.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.433
She told me they were her favorite flower.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.367
No. Her favorite flowers are yellow roses.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.767
Yeah, but those are expensive.

05:04.801 --> 05:07.634
She told me a cheap flower
because she wanted that ring.

05:07.667 --> 05:09.333
What?

05:10.934 --> 05:12.300
Where are you going?

05:22.367 --> 05:25.234
Hey, that's personal stuff in there.

05:25.268 --> 05:27.168
Take it to her.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.634
Nah. I can't do that.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.901
Do that, Dad. Please do that.

05:30.934 --> 05:32.967
With some yellow roses. The ring's paid for.

05:33.001 --> 05:34.700
How many times can I drive up there

05:34.734 --> 05:35.834
just to get rejected?

05:35.867 --> 05:37.567
As many times as it takes.

05:46.168 --> 05:47.967
You're not going to call
Ricky again, are you?

05:48.001 --> 05:50.168
I only called twice. John is fine.

05:50.201 --> 05:53.901
Yeah, but I like to make sure he's fine.

05:53.934 --> 05:56.134
Ricky's only kept him overnight once before,

05:56.168 --> 05:57.600
and he didn't even stay all night

05:57.634 --> 05:59.201
because I found out Adrian was over there.

05:59.234 --> 06:00.967
Ricky's girlfriend was
spending the night, too?

06:01.001 --> 06:02.901
No. She wasn't spending the night.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.201
I don't think.

06:04.234 --> 06:05.433
So your objection was?

06:05.467 --> 06:07.767
I don't like Adrian.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.034
Or I didn't.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.067
Well, now we're friends, kind of.

06:12.101 --> 06:14.268
So are you calling to find
out if she's over there

06:14.300 --> 06:15.500
or if John is okay?

06:15.534 --> 06:16.767
No, I know she's over there.

06:16.801 --> 06:18.433
I agreed that she could be over there.

06:18.467 --> 06:19.734
Are you worried about the baby

06:19.767 --> 06:22.433
or his daddy being with Adrian?

06:22.467 --> 06:24.234
You still have feelings for Ricky?

06:24.268 --> 06:25.801
No. I never really did.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.901
What about Ben? Do you still
have feelings for Ben?

06:27.934 --> 06:29.801
No. We're friends.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.500
Oh! Not the F word, pimento.

06:32.534 --> 06:33.967
Don't be friends with the guy.

06:34.001 --> 06:36.634
We are friends, and he's been
a really good friend to me.

06:36.667 --> 06:37.901
Did you have sex with him?

06:39.268 --> 06:41.168
No. I didn't.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.801
Good.

06:42.834 --> 06:45.367
Do you have sex with any
of your girlfriends?

06:45.400 --> 06:47.134
Nope.

06:47.168 --> 06:48.700
Really?

06:48.734 --> 06:51.801
Really. I'm waiting for the
one who's worth waiting for.

06:55.634 --> 06:57.333
I can't tell whether you're
telling the truth or not.

06:57.367 --> 06:59.234
I'm telling the truth.

06:59.268 --> 07:01.534
I don't want to have sex
while I'm in high school.

07:01.567 --> 07:04.201
I just don't think it's a good idea.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.067
Okay.

07:08.101 --> 07:11.234
Call Ricky. See how John is.

07:11.268 --> 07:13.934
No. It's okay.

07:13.967 --> 07:17.001
I'm sure that he's fine.

07:17.034 --> 07:18.700
Go out with us.

07:18.734 --> 07:20.400
I'm fine, really. I don't want to go out.

07:20.433 --> 07:22.433
Like old times, just the three of us.

07:22.467 --> 07:24.500
It'll never be like old times

07:24.534 --> 07:26.767
because there's the two of you,
and then there's me.

07:26.801 --> 07:27.834
I'm like a third wheel.

07:27.867 --> 07:29.467
You were always like a third wheel.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.700
Yeah. We were always a couple.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.101
Now you're a couple having sex.

07:32.134 --> 07:34.634
We're not going to be
having sex in front of you.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.934
I would hope not.
We'll just go to the movies.

07:36.967 --> 07:39.201
I have a screening room here.
Then we'll stay here.

07:39.234 --> 07:41.667
Please, just go. It's a Friday night.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.300
You should be out having a good time.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.134
While you stay here dreaming about Amy.

07:45.168 --> 07:46.300
Amy? Amy who?

07:46.333 --> 07:47.567
Yeah, right.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.001
Hey, it's over, and I'm fine with that.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.467
Do something, Hank. The man's a wreck.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.034
He looks okay to me.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.234
I am okay. Go.

07:55.268 --> 07:56.467
Call us.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.567
But not after 9.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600
Good night.

08:03.634 --> 08:06.001
You know, wine tastes like grapes.

08:07.534 --> 08:09.300
Hey. Leaving so soon?

08:09.333 --> 08:11.467
Yes, and unfortunately without Ben.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.567
Good night.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.667
So, Alice, you're driving?

08:13.700 --> 08:15.567
I can't drive with him in the car.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.134
How are you going to go anywhere?

08:17.168 --> 08:18.500
We don't have to go anywhere.

08:18.534 --> 08:20.268
Right.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.767
Because you two are in love.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.067
We are.

08:23.101 --> 08:24.400
I know you were counting on Ben

08:24.433 --> 08:25.600
to go out with you,

08:25.634 --> 08:27.001
so why don't you take the car?

08:27.034 --> 08:28.801
I'll have Mike drive you. Are you kidding?

08:28.834 --> 08:30.801
What if Ben decides to go out?

08:30.834 --> 08:32.268
He decided to stay in. It's okay.

08:32.299 --> 08:33.767
Take the car, the two of you.

08:33.801 --> 08:35.801
You've never offered us a car before.

08:35.833 --> 08:37.001
Is something wrong?

08:37.034 --> 08:38.600
No. Nothing's wrong.

08:38.634 --> 08:40.600
I'm here with my lovely bride-to-be.

08:40.634 --> 08:42.001
Ben's upstairs hanging out,

08:42.034 --> 08:44.268
and the driver and the car are free,

08:44.300 --> 08:45.867
so be my guest.

08:49.001 --> 08:52.101
Okay. I'll be over in 15 minutes.

08:52.134 --> 08:55.101
I had to lie to them.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.400
Yeah, I feel kind of bad about it,

08:57.433 --> 08:59.700
as well as bad about
having my dad lie to them,

08:59.734 --> 09:01.901
but hey, I'm looking
forward to my first date

09:01.934 --> 09:03.667
the first time I can drive.

09:03.700 --> 09:04.834
Ahem.

09:04.867 --> 09:07.433
Yeah. I know I can't take you anywhere,

09:07.467 --> 09:09.634
but I can drive myself over to your house,

09:09.667 --> 09:11.767
and I'm really excited to be coming over.

09:13.134 --> 09:14.367
Ciao.

09:21.867 --> 09:27.367
<i>* Love is lovelier </i>

09:27.400 --> 09:32.367
<i>* The second time around </i>

09:32.400 --> 09:33.801
You know, it is.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.101
It is the second time.

09:35.134 --> 09:37.134
This is the second time.

09:37.168 --> 09:39.034
It has to work.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.667
It has to.

09:40.668 --> 09:50.668

09:54.300 --> 09:56.001
Pizza delivery.

10:02.534 --> 10:03.534
Hello.

10:03.567 --> 10:05.901
I sent a pizza over. Why?

10:05.934 --> 10:07.867
Because I know you're there alone,

10:07.901 --> 10:09.534
and you don't want me to come over

10:09.567 --> 10:10.934
because you're all depressed
about your parents.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.467
And pizza will help?

10:12.500 --> 10:14.234
The guy's banging on the garage door.

10:14.268 --> 10:15.234
Well, let him in.

10:15.268 --> 10:16.901
I don't have money for a pizza.

10:16.934 --> 10:20.201
Oh, well, maybe you could
sleep with him or something.

10:20.234 --> 10:21.634
I'm not answering the door.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.134
You should answer the door.

10:23.168 --> 10:24.433
My dad's not home.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.067
I know the guy, okay?

10:26.101 --> 10:27.467
That's how I got him to deliver the pizza.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.168
Now answer the door and then call me back.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.600
Hold on. I'm coming.

10:38.734 --> 10:40.168
I'm over here.

10:43.534 --> 10:44.634
Wow.

10:44.667 --> 10:45.834
You said that out loud.

10:45.867 --> 10:47.801
I'm owning it.

10:47.834 --> 10:49.168
Wow.

10:49.201 --> 10:50.268
Wow what?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.700
Wow, uh, Griffin was right.

10:52.734 --> 10:54.101
I think I might like you.

10:55.201 --> 10:57.700
Uh, I think I might love you.

10:57.734 --> 10:59.268
Because?

10:59.300 --> 11:00.734
Because--

11:01.767 --> 11:03.168
Wow.

11:03.201 --> 11:05.367
How much is the pizza?

11:05.400 --> 11:07.867
Oh. Pizza's free.

11:07.901 --> 11:11.001
I think Griffin was hoping
we'd eat it together,

11:11.034 --> 11:14.967
and now I'm begging you,
could we eat this together?

11:15.001 --> 11:16.101
How old are you?

11:16.134 --> 11:17.967
I'm 16. I just got my license.

11:18.001 --> 11:19.101
And how do you know Griffin?

11:19.134 --> 11:20.534
He's my cousin. Are you gay?

11:20.567 --> 11:21.801
I know it runs in the family.

11:21.834 --> 11:23.934
No. Not gay.

11:23.967 --> 11:25.700
I got no problem with gay,

11:25.734 --> 11:28.168
but, uh, not gay.

11:28.201 --> 11:29.634
Ever killed anyone?

11:29.667 --> 11:30.734
Only with kindness.

11:32.333 --> 11:33.567
That wasn't funny, was it?

11:33.600 --> 11:34.567
Are you funny?

11:34.600 --> 11:35.700
Apparently not.

11:35.734 --> 11:37.034
You are making me nervous,

11:37.067 --> 11:38.333
asking me if I killed anyone or anything.

11:38.367 --> 11:39.567
I've never even been arrested.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.767
I've never even done anything illegal

11:41.801 --> 11:42.967
to get arrested for,

11:43.001 --> 11:45.834
and, uh, I think you're beautiful.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.901
Well, you still can't come in.
No one's home.

11:47.934 --> 11:48.967
Backyard.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.400
Griffin told me you got a backyard.

11:50.433 --> 11:51.834
All right.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.534
Go down the side of the house.

11:53.567 --> 11:54.734
All right.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.567
Your cousin?

12:02.600 --> 12:04.667
Yeah. Isn't he great?

12:04.700 --> 12:06.300
Why are you fixing me up with your cousin?

12:06.333 --> 12:07.834
I thought we weren't dating in high school.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.767
Oh, be his friend. He needs a friend.

12:09.801 --> 12:11.268
You need a friend.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.801
Good-looking people have
difficulty making friends.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.734
You and I both know that.

12:15.767 --> 12:16.834
What's his name?

12:16.867 --> 12:18.367
You didn't even ask his name?

12:18.400 --> 12:20.067
No. Grant.

12:20.101 --> 12:21.433
Does everyone in your family have a name

12:21.467 --> 12:22.567
that starts with a G?

12:22.600 --> 12:23.867
Yeah.

12:23.901 --> 12:25.667
All right. I'll give him a half an hour.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.234
Well, go. The pizza's getting cold.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.367
And be nice.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.767
Do you want to have dessert
here or go somewhere else?

12:33.801 --> 12:35.634
I don't know. Where would we go?

12:35.667 --> 12:37.433
Oh, I'm picturing some place

12:37.467 --> 12:39.234
where we could be alone and talk.

12:39.268 --> 12:41.967
Maybe just drive somewhere and park.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.500
I don't know about that.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.067
Maybe we should just have something here.

12:46.101 --> 12:47.967
Are you afraid to be alone with me?

12:48.001 --> 12:51.400
Maybe just a smudge.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.234
Did you want to order dessert, coffee?

12:54.268 --> 12:55.567
Uh, yeah. I'll have a little something.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.867
Or maybe we could share something.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.433
Do you have a dessert menu?

12:58.467 --> 12:59.967
Of course.

13:00.001 --> 13:02.500
You know, I didn't think about something.

13:02.534 --> 13:04.333
Maybe we're spending too much money here.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.600
We don't have to order dessert.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.600
I was doing that so we could
spend more time together.

13:07.634 --> 13:09.700
Look, you ordered the
cheapest thing on the menu,

13:09.734 --> 13:11.834
and I appreciate that, believe me.

13:11.867 --> 13:14.567
But I have enough money for dessert,

13:14.600 --> 13:15.867
and even a tip.

13:15.901 --> 13:21.333
But thank you for being so considerate.

13:25.801 --> 13:27.433
You're welcome.

13:27.467 --> 13:28.700
Thank you for dinner.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.168
Okay, that's not on the menu.

13:34.934 --> 13:35.967
Yeah.

13:36.001 --> 13:37.001
You pick.

13:37.034 --> 13:38.134
Uh, traditional.

13:38.168 --> 13:40.134
Apple pie and ice cream. Perfect.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.901
Look at Hot Amy. Hi.

13:43.934 --> 13:45.634
We didn't know you were going to be here.

13:45.667 --> 13:46.934
Is this Jimmy?

13:46.967 --> 13:49.500
Yeah. Is this Madison and Lauren?

13:49.534 --> 13:51.101
Jimmy. Jimmy.

13:53.001 --> 13:54.834
We're go glad we finally got to meet you.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.700
This is Jack. Don't you
love his new haircut?

13:56.734 --> 13:58.201
I made him do it.

13:58.234 --> 13:59.333
Made?

13:59.367 --> 14:01.667
Oh, and this is Jesse.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.367
Good night.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.467
Good night. Good night. Nice meeting you.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.101
No, no. Why don't you sit down, join us?

14:07.134 --> 14:08.700
We just ordered dessert.

14:08.734 --> 14:10.300
Okay. Okay.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.767
Good night, John.

14:19.801 --> 14:22.001
Daddy will be right in the next room.

14:22.034 --> 14:24.034
I love you.

14:38.101 --> 14:39.967
Thanks, Adrian.

14:40.001 --> 14:41.367
This is really nice.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.333
Well, I hope you like it.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.333
It's chicken with mole sauce.

14:45.367 --> 14:48.168
I can't believe I've been
going out with you this long

14:48.201 --> 14:49.567
and never knew you cooked.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.367
Well, there isn't exactly
a kitchen in the bedroom.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.101
No, there isn't, not that I'm complaining.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.268
I wonder if this is what
married life will feel like.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.667
No. This is what not married is like,
I have a feeling.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.801
Mm. Before dinner.

15:11.834 --> 15:14.433
After dinner and before breakfast.

15:14.467 --> 15:15.767
I can't spend the night.

15:15.801 --> 15:17.500
We'll talk.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.834
Ben. Come in.

15:25.867 --> 15:26.834
Thank you.

15:26.867 --> 15:30.667
Uh, these are for you.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.801
Thank you.

15:31.834 --> 15:33.134
They're gorgeous. That's so sweet.

15:33.168 --> 15:34.433
Oh, thanks.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.734
It's so nice that you chose to be with me

15:36.767 --> 15:38.101
the first night you can drive.

15:38.134 --> 15:40.201
I feel so special.

15:40.234 --> 15:42.767
You are special, Grace.

15:42.801 --> 15:44.567
I thought you were special

15:44.600 --> 15:46.767
since the first time I saw you.

15:46.801 --> 15:51.001
And I know a lot has happened since then,

15:51.034 --> 15:53.600
but I would love it if we could be friends.

15:53.634 --> 15:55.300
Of course.

15:57.534 --> 15:59.201
You can do this.

15:59.234 --> 16:00.667
You can do it. You can.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.801
You've gotten her back a
thousand times before.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.234
You can get her back now.

16:04.268 --> 16:05.500
I want a family.

16:05.534 --> 16:07.901
I want to live the dream, yeah!

16:16.034 --> 16:17.201
Live, damn it!

16:17.234 --> 16:19.134
Come on, buddy, live!

16:23.333 --> 16:24.567
It's a good omen.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.700
So do you go back to med camp this summer?

16:36.734 --> 16:37.901
Yeah, I've been invited back.

16:37.934 --> 16:39.001
Although I think sports medicine

16:39.034 --> 16:40.333
was a bit of a lark.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.967
I might go in a different direction.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.500
Like?

16:43.534 --> 16:45.500
Cardiology?

16:45.534 --> 16:47.534
I know heart disease is
a big issue for women,

16:47.567 --> 16:49.400
so I'll probably focus on
women and heart problems.

16:49.433 --> 16:52.201
What's the best school for that?

16:52.234 --> 16:54.934
I don't know, but that's another
reason to go to this camp.

16:54.967 --> 16:56.134
You make great connections,

16:56.168 --> 16:57.433
and they give great career guidance

16:57.467 --> 16:58.600
selecting a school,

16:58.634 --> 16:59.901
and they help you get into the school.

16:59.934 --> 17:01.234
It's a really great thing for me.

17:01.268 --> 17:04.001
I so admire you for knowing
exactly what you want to do.

17:04.034 --> 17:06.034
I'm still not sure.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.167
Although if I stay in the meat business,

17:08.201 --> 17:09.967
I'm sure it'll be out of the butcher shop

17:10.001 --> 17:11.233
and more in an office.

17:11.268 --> 17:12.901
My dad never went to college,

17:12.934 --> 17:14.400
and he's done well for himself,

17:14.433 --> 17:16.901
but he'd like me to go, and I want to go.

17:16.934 --> 17:19.367
I'll probably get a degree
in international business.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.268
Is that why you're learning Italian?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.867
That and other reasons.

17:22.901 --> 17:24.967
We have family in Italy.

17:25.001 --> 17:26.867
My dad's Italian and Jewish, actually,

17:26.901 --> 17:28.767
My dad's dad is from Brooklyn.
He was Jewish.

17:28.801 --> 17:30.767
And then my dad's mom was Sicilian.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.700
Catholic? Yep.

17:32.734 --> 17:34.034
And your mom? From Brooklyn,

17:34.067 --> 17:37.067
but both sides Italian-- and Catholic, yeah.

17:37.101 --> 17:39.300
I'm WASP, all the way.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.300
So how is your dad?

17:42.333 --> 17:45.667
That is a crazy match, my dad and Betty,

17:45.700 --> 17:47.268
but they seem happy.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.067
You can never tell you will
fall in love with whom.

17:50.101 --> 17:52.433
No, you can't.

17:52.467 --> 17:54.034
<i>*</i>

17:59.134 --> 18:00.901
I want to get married.

18:00.934 --> 18:02.767
Oh, me, too.

18:02.801 --> 18:03.801
When?

18:03.834 --> 18:07.268
Whenever you want.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.534
I want a wedding.

18:08.567 --> 18:10.101
A small wedding here.

18:10.134 --> 18:11.534
Oh, I don't know.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.333
I don't think your friends and family

18:13.367 --> 18:15.801
will ever be as excited as
me about getting married.

18:15.834 --> 18:17.901
I don't have any family here other than Ben,

18:17.934 --> 18:18.934
and he loves you.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.500
And if my friends don't love you,

18:20.534 --> 18:22.467
they're not my friends.
It's as simple as that.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.234
So you go get yourself a
beautiful wedding dress

18:24.268 --> 18:25.500
and tell me what you want

18:25.534 --> 18:27.367
in terms of flowers and things like that,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.734
who you want in the wedding,
and we'll do it.

18:31.034 --> 18:33.268
Ecru.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.268
I beg your pardon?

18:34.300 --> 18:35.433
Well,

18:35.467 --> 18:37.234
I don't think I should wear white.

18:37.268 --> 18:38.834
I think I should wear ecru.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.300
You can wear any color you want.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.600
You can wear red if you want.

18:41.634 --> 18:43.067
Okay.

18:43.101 --> 18:44.734
Well, maybe not red.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.201
Ecru, then.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.534
Mmm!

19:02.201 --> 19:04.901
What exactly is ecru?

19:04.934 --> 19:07.834
Oh, it's like a dirty white.

19:09.001 --> 19:10.700
Thanks for dropping by.

19:10.734 --> 19:11.700
It was nice to meet you.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.234
Nice meeting you.

19:14.801 --> 19:18.168
So how's that parked car sounding now?

19:18.201 --> 19:20.001
Perfect.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.500
This was a bad idea.

19:21.534 --> 19:22.767
I'll say.

19:22.801 --> 19:24.067
So what did you think?

19:24.101 --> 19:25.500
He's cute.

19:25.534 --> 19:26.967
Do you like him better than Ben?

19:27.001 --> 19:28.634
No. Me, either.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.834
I thought he was cute.

19:31.467 --> 19:34.333
I'm joking. I was just trying
to stay in the conversation.

19:34.367 --> 19:36.634
I think the Ben and Amy thing is over.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.067
You don't know that.

19:38.101 --> 19:39.967
You don't know that. I know that.

19:40.001 --> 19:41.101
No, you don't.

19:41.134 --> 19:42.500
Yes, I do.

19:42.534 --> 19:44.168
Ben is out with Grace tonight.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.567
He asked her out,
and she wanted to go out with him.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.734
She told me this? Yeah, she told me.

19:49.767 --> 19:51.667
And why are you just telling me?

19:51.700 --> 19:52.901
Yeah, why are you just telling her?

19:52.934 --> 19:53.967
This is the strangest date

19:54.001 --> 19:55.534
I think I've ever been on.

19:55.567 --> 19:56.834
Excuse me?

19:59.467 --> 20:01.001
I think we should call Amy.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.934
No. No, no, no.

20:02.967 --> 20:04.333
You know they're going to tell her.

20:04.367 --> 20:05.534
Did you know?

20:05.567 --> 20:06.934
Yeah, but I don't care.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.500
How do you know?

20:08.534 --> 20:09.934
I told him. Why?

20:09.967 --> 20:11.600
Because you two were a half hour late.

20:11.634 --> 20:13.001
I was running out of stuff to talk about.

20:13.034 --> 20:14.067
We're not on a date.

20:14.101 --> 20:15.201
You don't have to talk to me.

20:15.234 --> 20:16.367
I don't know.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.934
I've never been on a double date before.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.600
The rules are you're supposed to tell me

20:19.634 --> 20:21.634
that has anything to do with Amy.

20:21.667 --> 20:22.934
It has nothing to do with Amy.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.600
You better watch out.

20:24.634 --> 20:26.433
What? What did I do?

20:26.467 --> 20:28.801
Jimmy took care of it.

20:29.801 --> 20:30.901
He just did that

20:30.934 --> 20:32.300
because he thought Ben would do that.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.034
Ben would do that.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.367
You know, this Jimmy is good.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.134
Maybe he's not so bad after all.

20:38.168 --> 20:41.101
Yeah. Especially since Ben's out with Grace.

20:45.867 --> 20:46.967
I'll do this.

20:47.001 --> 20:49.234
No. We'll do this together.

20:49.268 --> 20:50.934
I like doing dishes with you.

20:50.967 --> 20:53.067
You cooked. I don't mind cleaning, really.

20:53.101 --> 20:54.767
Let me finish this.

20:54.801 --> 20:56.168
You go check on John.

20:58.168 --> 20:59.234
All right.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.101
Hey, buddy, what are you doing?

21:08.134 --> 21:11.201
I thought you were sleeping.
Now you're crying?

21:11.234 --> 21:12.467
You weren't making any noise.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.234
Come on. Come here.

21:14.268 --> 21:15.467
Come on.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.700
Hmm?

21:23.367 --> 21:25.001
He's fine.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.268
Fine. Just checking.

21:27.300 --> 21:28.567
Well, if you're checking

21:28.600 --> 21:30.467
to se if Adrian's still here,
she's still here.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.801
Okay.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.534
He's fine. We're fine.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.567
Just make sure to pay attention to him

21:35.600 --> 21:36.801
and not just Adrian.

21:36.834 --> 21:38.400
I know.

21:39.567 --> 21:40.801
How's your date going?

21:40.834 --> 21:42.767
Fine.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.934
I'll be there at 6:30 tomorrow morning

21:44.967 --> 21:46.201
when he gets up.

21:46.234 --> 21:47.867
I'll bring him home when he gets up.

21:47.901 --> 21:49.001
As soon as he wakes up,

21:49.034 --> 21:50.300
I'll bring him right back to you.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.667
All right.

21:51.700 --> 21:54.134
Tell Adrian I said hello.

21:54.168 --> 21:55.834
I will. Good night.

21:55.867 --> 21:57.934
And don't call again, okay?

21:57.967 --> 21:59.600
And I don't say that
because you're annoying me.

21:59.634 --> 22:01.734
I just don't want you to annoy that guy.

22:01.767 --> 22:04.433
If you really like him everything's fine.

22:04.467 --> 22:05.867
Good night.

22:05.901 --> 22:06.901
<i>Good night.</i>

22:08.500 --> 22:09.801
They're fine.

22:09.834 --> 22:10.967
I knew they would be.

22:16.134 --> 22:17.134
So.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.700
So, you want to make out?

22:21.734 --> 22:23.834
That's not very romantic.

22:25.801 --> 22:27.400
Yeah. I do.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.734
Great.

22:28.767 --> 22:29.867
All right, you start.

22:29.901 --> 22:32.134
You kiss me.

22:32.168 --> 22:33.300
Come on. it's too awkward

22:33.333 --> 22:35.067
if I lean over and kiss you.

22:35.101 --> 22:37.667
No. No, you go first.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.067
All right.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.500
Was that okay?

22:49.534 --> 22:50.567
Yeah.

22:56.934 --> 22:59.500
If he doesn't come back
with her tonight, that's it.

22:59.534 --> 23:02.534
I don't think he'll ever
drive up there again.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.168
I don't think his ego could take it.

23:04.201 --> 23:05.268
I don't understand

23:05.300 --> 23:06.934
why she won't come home at this point.

23:06.967 --> 23:09.001
I know she has to take
care of my grandmother,

23:09.034 --> 23:10.767
but she has to bring Robbie home.

23:10.801 --> 23:12.467
We have to at least try to make it work,

23:12.500 --> 23:14.067
or else it's always going
to feel like we failed.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.268
I don't mind failing if we try first

23:16.300 --> 23:18.067
because that's not really failing.

23:18.101 --> 23:20.967
Not to try at all is to fail, and--

23:21.001 --> 23:22.867
Oh, my God, am I still talking?

23:22.901 --> 23:24.268
Yeah.

23:24.300 --> 23:25.433
Sorry. I've--

23:25.467 --> 23:28.168
I've never done that before.

23:28.201 --> 23:30.300
I'm not really much of a talker.

23:30.333 --> 23:32.867
Maybe you never found the
right person to talk to.

23:32.901 --> 23:34.634
See, now you've turned it around

23:34.667 --> 23:36.567
and made it some kind of gooey "we" thing.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.034
You shouldn't have said anything.

23:38.067 --> 23:40.034
Now I feel all weird.

23:40.067 --> 23:42.234
I know what could make you feel weirder.

23:43.567 --> 23:44.767
I could kiss you.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.967
Oh, say, get the dog.

23:57.001 --> 23:59.101
Moose? Moose!

24:02.700 --> 24:04.667
Moose. Darn.

24:04.700 --> 24:07.168
I wasn't going to kiss you.

24:07.201 --> 24:08.901
Sure you were.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.317
What? I never slept with her.

24:30.351 --> 24:32.384
You slept with her.
You slept with her in Chicago.

24:32.417 --> 24:34.683
I did not. And I would tell you if I did.

24:34.717 --> 24:36.817
Anne told me. And where is Anne again?

24:36.850 --> 24:39.451
With Mimsy. Where with
Mimsy this time of night?

24:39.484 --> 24:40.717
She went to go for a ride.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.351
Mimsy wanted to go for a ride.

24:42.384 --> 24:43.683
She couldn't settle down.

24:43.717 --> 24:45.451
So the nurse is off.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.417
Anne asked me to come over. I came over.

24:47.451 --> 24:49.217
Nothing more than that. I don't believe you.

24:49.251 --> 24:50.217
Believe me, George.

24:50.251 --> 24:51.618
And believe me about Chicago, too.

24:51.650 --> 24:54.750
My brother called me when he
ran into Anne in the hotel bar.

24:54.783 --> 24:56.850
They had a few drinks.
They got me on the phone.

24:56.884 --> 24:59.050
We started acting like idiots,
like in high school.

24:59.084 --> 25:01.317
We made some jokes about making out,
and that was it.

25:01.351 --> 25:03.217
Why would she want me to
think she slept with you?

25:03.251 --> 25:05.184
Probably to get back at
you for what you did.

25:05.217 --> 25:06.417
And I know what you did.

25:08.151 --> 25:10.151
Now what am I going to do?

25:10.184 --> 25:12.084
Go home. Let her come to you.

25:12.117 --> 25:13.750
She's going to come home to you.

25:13.783 --> 25:14.984
Don't screw it up this time.

25:15.017 --> 25:16.518
Just give her the flowers, all right?

25:16.551 --> 25:18.683
Yeah, sure. Gladiolas?

25:18.717 --> 25:20.518
Yeah. Good night.

25:20.551 --> 25:22.551
I'm just going to go say
good night to Robbie.

25:27.650 --> 25:30.284
I can't believe we've been
talking this whole time.

25:30.317 --> 25:31.750
I'm-- I'm sorry about that.

25:31.783 --> 25:33.050
No, it was really nice.

25:33.084 --> 25:35.850
I'm going to have to go.
I can't drive past 11:00.

25:35.884 --> 25:37.484
Oh, that's right. That's the law.

25:37.518 --> 25:38.584
I know.

25:42.518 --> 25:44.017
Thanks again for letting me come over.

25:44.050 --> 25:45.518
Yeah, I had fun. Yeah.

25:49.917 --> 25:51.884
Oh, I'll walk you to the door. Oh.

25:55.451 --> 25:59.618
So maybe next time, if there is a next time,

25:59.650 --> 26:01.484
if you'll consider going out with me,

26:01.518 --> 26:04.284
I'll get out driver so we
can really go somewhere.

26:04.317 --> 26:05.950
Sure. I'd love to do that.

26:05.984 --> 26:08.050
We sent him out with
Alice and Henry tonight.

26:08.084 --> 26:10.084
I didn't want them to know where I'm going.

26:10.117 --> 26:11.618
Is it a secret?

26:11.650 --> 26:14.017
Well, you know how things are.

26:14.050 --> 26:17.317
And people love to talk,
so I didn't tell anyone.

26:17.351 --> 26:19.351
I just wanted this to be our night

26:19.384 --> 26:21.284
and not have the whole
world talking about it.

26:21.317 --> 26:22.750
Oh.

26:22.783 --> 26:24.950
I probably shouldn't have told Jack.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.417
Oh, you told Jack?

26:26.451 --> 26:28.117
Well, we're friends,

26:28.151 --> 26:30.317
and he asked me what I was doing tonight.

26:30.351 --> 26:31.817
Oh, of course. I--

26:31.850 --> 26:35.084
I forgot that you might still talk to Jack.

26:35.117 --> 26:36.384
I should have said something

26:36.417 --> 26:37.551
if I didn't want anybody to know.

26:37.584 --> 26:39.084
I'm sorry.

26:39.117 --> 26:40.251
Oh, no, it's okay.

26:40.284 --> 26:42.518
Uh, good night.

26:50.417 --> 26:51.750
Good night.

27:03.217 --> 27:04.917
Well, you have a long drive,

27:04.950 --> 27:06.650
so I guess we should say good night.

27:06.683 --> 27:08.484
Oh, I don't know if I can say anything.

27:08.518 --> 27:10.017
My lips are kind of worn out.

27:11.650 --> 27:13.050
That was fun.

27:13.084 --> 27:15.184
Yeah. That was a great date.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.584
I had a really nice time.

27:16.618 --> 27:19.618
Me, too. So...

27:19.650 --> 27:21.451
So...

27:30.683 --> 27:31.717
Good night.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.817
Oh, Uh, I forgot my purse.

27:34.850 --> 27:37.584
Ah. A leave-behind. I like that.

27:37.618 --> 27:38.717
I didn't do it on purpose.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.217
You did, too. I'll get it.

28:02.050 --> 28:04.618
Hey. So it went well?

28:04.683 --> 28:07.184
Yeah, it went well. How was your night?

28:07.217 --> 28:08.184
it was okay.

28:08.217 --> 28:09.184
What did you do?

28:09.217 --> 28:10.251
Nothing.

28:11.251 --> 28:12.351
Good night.

28:12.384 --> 28:13.584
See you.

28:17.584 --> 28:18.917
Who was that?

28:18.950 --> 28:20.451
Who was who?

28:24.050 --> 28:25.084
Hey.

28:25.117 --> 28:27.017
Yeah, hi.

28:27.050 --> 28:30.817
Oh, uh, were you with Ashley?

28:30.850 --> 28:32.217
I'm not with.

28:32.251 --> 28:35.017
I'm Jimmy. I'm Amy's friend.

28:35.050 --> 28:36.683
Amy?

28:36.717 --> 28:37.783
Ashley's sister.

28:37.817 --> 28:41.417
She never said anything
about having a sister.

28:41.451 --> 28:43.451
Or maybe she did.

28:44.750 --> 28:47.850
I was mostly just staring at her.

28:47.884 --> 28:49.917
And smelling her.

28:49.950 --> 28:51.884
She smells great, that girl.

28:51.917 --> 28:54.917
Yeah. Uh, do me a favor, would you?

28:54.950 --> 28:56.417
Would you take that back to Amy?

28:56.451 --> 28:58.251
She left it in my truck,
and I gotta take off.

28:58.284 --> 28:59.650
Yeah, no problem.

28:59.683 --> 29:01.217
Happy to go back.

29:03.817 --> 29:06.618
And after that, we just made out.
It was great.

29:06.650 --> 29:08.084
Better than making out with Ben?

29:08.117 --> 29:09.451
Different.

29:09.484 --> 29:11.984
I like him, Ashley.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.950
I mean, I love Ben. You know that.

29:13.984 --> 29:15.950
But this is new, and it's exciting,

29:15.984 --> 29:19.650
and I'm just in such a different
place than where I met Ben.

29:21.317 --> 29:23.484
Some guy outside said to give this to you,

29:23.518 --> 29:25.417
if you're Amy. I'm Amy.

29:25.451 --> 29:27.384
Here you go. It was nice
seeing you again, Ashley.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.451
Good night. Now I'm back, I don't guess

29:29.484 --> 29:31.584
you'd wanna keep making out
until you dad gets home?

29:31.618 --> 29:33.518
No.

29:33.551 --> 29:35.551
All right. Bye.

29:40.650 --> 29:43.518
My head is spinning.

29:43.551 --> 29:45.584
Why did Jimmy not bring this in to me?

29:45.618 --> 29:49.650
And who is that guy? And where is Dad?

29:49.683 --> 29:52.384
And why did Jimmy not bring this in to me?

29:57.050 --> 29:58.017
Madison.

29:58.050 --> 29:59.251
And Lauren.

29:59.284 --> 30:01.850
Look, we have to tell you something.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.151
Are you still with Jimmy? No. Why?

30:04.184 --> 30:06.017
Ben went out with Grace Bowman tonight.

30:06.050 --> 30:07.017
Ben and Grace?

30:07.050 --> 30:08.984
<i>Yep. The two of them.</i>

30:09.017 --> 30:13.817
So you might wanna stick with Jimmy.

30:13.850 --> 30:15.351
<i>Oh, and tell him thank
you for dinner.</i>

30:15.384 --> 30:16.817
Okay, I will.

30:22.417 --> 30:24.251
If I ever see him again.

30:27.084 --> 30:28.518
Ben is out with Grace.

30:28.551 --> 30:29.750
Oh.

30:29.783 --> 30:31.151
Well, that can't be true.

30:31.184 --> 30:33.717
Why did he not bring in my purse?

30:33.750 --> 30:35.017
I have no idea.

30:39.417 --> 30:41.484
Don't call him. Let him call you.

30:41.518 --> 30:43.317
Just be cool, Amy.

30:45.451 --> 30:47.284
Did Mom do that to you?

30:47.317 --> 30:49.850
Your mother? Your mother's a saint.

30:49.884 --> 30:52.518
And from what I heard from her boyfriend,
she might be coming home soon.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.151
All right. Well, that's good.

30:54.184 --> 30:56.351
I just hope Moose comes home soon.
He ran off with some dog.

30:56.384 --> 30:58.217
I'll get him.

30:58.251 --> 31:01.017
How was your date, Ames? How was Jimmy?

31:01.050 --> 31:02.650
Uh, good.

31:09.584 --> 31:11.217
Thanks for everything.

31:11.251 --> 31:12.650
Even for telling George
that you and I never--

31:12.683 --> 31:14.017
Especially for that.

31:14.050 --> 31:16.484
He never would've believed me.

31:16.518 --> 31:19.817
I shouldn't have lied to him.
He just made it so easy.

31:19.850 --> 31:21.551
He doesn't seem like a bad guy.

31:21.584 --> 31:26.017
No. He's just so...George.

31:28.151 --> 31:32.650
Oh, I forgot. He left you something.

31:32.683 --> 31:35.351
These, uh, crummy flowers.

31:35.384 --> 31:36.950
Oh.

31:56.951 --> 31:58.551
Good morning.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.150
Why not the kitchen door?

32:00.183 --> 32:02.551
We're broken up,
and we're just friends, so--

32:02.584 --> 32:05.417
So what's so important you had
to come by without calling?

32:05.450 --> 32:07.517
I thought I should tell you that I--

32:07.551 --> 32:10.584
I kind of mentioned that you were
out with Ben to Madison, that's all.

32:10.617 --> 32:14.417
Because? Just making conversation.

32:14.450 --> 32:16.083
You know what? That's something

32:16.117 --> 32:17.584
you and Madison actually have in common--

32:17.617 --> 32:20.050
talking too much.
You were the one who told me.

32:20.083 --> 32:22.918
Yes, well, maybe I shouldn't
tell you anything from now on.

32:22.951 --> 32:26.450
All right. Fine.
How'd your date go last night?

32:26.484 --> 32:29.751
Why would I tell you? I just told you
I wasn't gonna tell you anything.

32:29.784 --> 32:31.217
And it wasn't actually a date.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.117
It was just two friends getting together.

32:33.150 --> 32:35.551
We're two friends. Could we get together?

32:35.584 --> 32:38.317
What? What happened to Madison?

32:38.350 --> 32:41.050
You're my girlfriend.
I want to be out with my girlfriend.

32:41.083 --> 32:42.851
No, Jack. I am not your girlfriend.

32:42.884 --> 32:45.717
I think that you are a great guy.

32:45.751 --> 32:47.517
I just don't think we're good together.

32:47.551 --> 32:49.484
We're bad together.

32:49.517 --> 32:51.784
It's just not for me.

32:51.817 --> 32:54.484
Everyone knows Ben just wants to have sex.

32:54.517 --> 32:57.018
Guys behave differently
around different girls.

32:57.050 --> 32:59.817
He was a perfect gentleman with me.

32:59.851 --> 33:01.784
And I like it. I'm going out with him again.

33:01.817 --> 33:04.484
All right. If you get tired of him,
you know where to find me.

33:04.517 --> 33:06.317
Yeah, I do. With Madison.

33:06.350 --> 33:08.450
Bye, Jack.

33:08.484 --> 33:11.918
Wait. Where's your mom and Tom?

33:11.951 --> 33:14.384
They're at a conference.
They'll be back later.

33:14.417 --> 33:15.951
Do you need to talk to them?

33:15.984 --> 33:17.050
Were they here last night?

33:17.083 --> 33:18.951
No, they were not here last night.

33:18.984 --> 33:21.551
Damn. Jack!

33:21.584 --> 33:23.083
We could've been good together.

33:23.117 --> 33:24.250
Yes, we could have.

33:24.284 --> 33:25.984
However, we made some mistakes--

33:26.018 --> 33:29.317
mistakes that changed how I feel about you.

33:29.350 --> 33:30.851
I like you. I want to be friends.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.984
I just don't think we're
good as boyfriend-girlfriend.

33:33.018 --> 33:36.684
And if you're gonna be with Madison,
Jack, just be with Madison.

33:36.717 --> 33:38.984
'Cause nobody respects a cheater, okay?

33:39.018 --> 33:41.384
Okay. Bye, Jack.

33:41.417 --> 33:43.150
Bye, Grace.

33:48.117 --> 33:50.851
Oh, good morning, sir. And thank you.

33:50.884 --> 33:53.018
That was really nice of you, sir.

33:53.050 --> 33:54.250
Bye, Mike!

33:55.918 --> 33:59.083
Sorry, sir, but you did say as directed.

33:59.117 --> 34:00.517
You been out all night? Yes.

34:00.551 --> 34:02.317
We took a ride up to the coast

34:02.350 --> 34:06.684
to a place that Alice knows
that has date shakes.

34:06.717 --> 34:09.018
Milkshakes with dates, sir. Quite good.

34:09.050 --> 34:10.449
You been out all night?

34:10.484 --> 34:12.650
They called their parents,
and I spoke with them.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.617
All night?

34:14.650 --> 34:16.583
They didn't do anything in my car, did they?

34:16.617 --> 34:19.784
Oh, no. But I wouldn't recommend
tempting them with a second time.

34:19.817 --> 34:21.484
Oh, there's not gonna be a second time.

34:21.516 --> 34:23.684
That's why they wanted
to stay out all night.

34:23.717 --> 34:27.350
Go get some rest.
Betty's gonna wanna go shopping.

34:27.384 --> 34:29.617
Give me an hour or two, if you will.

34:33.317 --> 34:35.117
All night?

34:38.317 --> 34:40.217
Where'd you hear that? Madison.

34:40.250 --> 34:42.784
She calls this morning, otherwise we'd
still be on Pacific Coast Highway.

34:42.817 --> 34:45.384
That was great, man. It was so
good to be rich for a night.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.551
But Grace?

34:46.583 --> 34:48.217
I would've told you guys,

34:48.250 --> 34:49.684
but I was trying to be discreet.

34:49.717 --> 34:51.516
I didn't know she was gonna tell anyone.

34:51.551 --> 34:53.717
Wait a minute. If we had the driver,
how'd you get there?

34:53.751 --> 34:56.217
I drove.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.584
I got my license yesterday.

35:00.050 --> 35:02.450
Hey, awesome.

35:02.484 --> 35:04.384
Wait. You didn't tell us that, either.

35:04.417 --> 35:07.117
I was gonna surprise you guys.
I was gonna pull up in front of your house.

35:07.150 --> 35:09.551
I don't like surprises.
Don't get upset, Alice.

35:09.584 --> 35:11.551
It was his dad who gave
us the ride of a lifetime.

35:11.584 --> 35:13.551
We had the sunroof open. We got date shakes.

35:13.584 --> 35:16.918
We watched the sun rise on the beach.
We can't be angry at him.

35:16.951 --> 35:19.918
Your dad knew you were trying to keep
driving over to Grace's house a secret?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.384
Well, yeah.

35:21.417 --> 35:23.951
And Betty? Yeah.

35:23.984 --> 35:27.018
All right. Then I'm angry with both of them.

35:27.050 --> 35:30.350
Alice, come on. Please,
don't be angry with anyone.

35:30.384 --> 35:32.817
Not today. Today is a good day.

35:32.851 --> 35:35.317
I got my license yesterday,
and I had a date with a girl

35:35.350 --> 35:37.551
I once would only dream about talking to.

35:37.584 --> 35:39.884
Come on. I'll make you guys some breakfast,

35:39.918 --> 35:41.250
and I'll tell you everything.

35:41.284 --> 35:43.083
There's something to tell?

35:44.217 --> 35:46.350
She kissed me.

35:46.384 --> 35:48.751
She kissed me.

35:48.784 --> 35:51.117
Maybe I'm just tired because
I've been up all night.

35:51.150 --> 35:54.150
But I don't like that she kissed you,
and I'll tell you why.

35:54.183 --> 35:57.250
Because now, if you ever
change your mind about Amy,

35:57.284 --> 35:59.851
she will never change her mind about you.

36:04.918 --> 36:06.851
John woke up. I drove him over here,

36:06.884 --> 36:09.284
and he fell back asleep,
so I put him down in the nursery.

36:09.317 --> 36:12.117
Okay. Well, everything go okay?

36:12.150 --> 36:13.417
He woke up a few times,

36:13.450 --> 36:15.117
but he went right back to sleep.

36:15.150 --> 36:19.517
Adrian didn't spend the
night over there, did she?

36:19.551 --> 36:21.951
Don't get angry. You said she
would not spend the night.

36:21.984 --> 36:24.784
We stayed up late. It took a
while to get John back to bed.

36:24.817 --> 36:27.350
She was tired. I didn't want her driving,
and I couldn't drive her home.

36:27.384 --> 36:28.617
So she slept on the couch.

36:28.651 --> 36:30.350
I swear, we didn't do anything.

36:30.384 --> 36:33.817
All right. Well, I guess it's
none of my business anyway.

36:33.851 --> 36:36.183
Really?

36:36.217 --> 36:38.384
Wait. What's going on? Something's going on.

36:38.417 --> 36:40.851
Ben went out with Grace last night.

36:40.884 --> 36:42.117
Oh, yeah. Adrian told me.

36:42.150 --> 36:44.250
But you were out on a date.
What do you care?

36:44.284 --> 36:48.183
Going out with Jimmy is not the
same as Ben going out with Grace.

36:48.217 --> 36:49.417
She's part of our group.

36:49.450 --> 36:51.217
I thought she was my friend, kind of.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.417
She is your friend.
Grace is everyone's friend.

36:53.450 --> 36:55.984
And she's probably just
being a friend to Ben

36:56.018 --> 36:58.018
because you were out. You think?

36:58.050 --> 37:01.050
Man, I thought you were happy
about you and Ben breaking up.

37:01.083 --> 37:03.817
Unlike you, I have feelings,

37:03.851 --> 37:06.784
and I can't just turn
my feelings on and off.

37:06.817 --> 37:09.517
I am happy that we broke up,
but I still care about him.

37:09.551 --> 37:12.117
And I care that he was out with
my dad's ex-wife's daughter.

37:12.150 --> 37:15.951
Amy, it seems like in the past few weeks,

37:15.984 --> 37:17.918
you've been a lot more confident,

37:17.951 --> 37:19.918
more grown-up.

37:19.951 --> 37:23.651
It seems like you just started
accepting the way things are

37:23.684 --> 37:26.484
and being comfortable with
yourself and who you are.

37:26.517 --> 37:29.584
I like the changes.

37:29.617 --> 37:32.284
Don't go back to all that old stuff.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.884
You've been so difficult the last year,

37:34.918 --> 37:38.350
and I know you were going through the
most difficult challenges in your life,

37:38.384 --> 37:40.384
but it seemed to me that

37:40.417 --> 37:42.951
you just got over the hurdle
and started enjoying yourself.

37:44.851 --> 37:48.217
Don't get caught up with
Ben and Grace and all that.

37:48.250 --> 37:51.150
You are moving in the right direction.

37:51.183 --> 37:52.684
Keep moving.

37:52.717 --> 37:55.018
Thanks. You're welcome.

37:55.050 --> 37:58.617
I-- I really needed to hear that.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.183
I needed to hear

38:00.217 --> 38:02.317
that I'm doing something right for once.

38:04.117 --> 38:06.117
I slept on the couch, I swear.

38:06.150 --> 38:07.918
We were up all night taking care of John.

38:07.951 --> 38:10.350
There's no staying out all night.
I don't like that.

38:10.384 --> 38:12.551
Yeah, neither do I. I thought you wanted me

38:12.584 --> 38:14.617
to get this house so Ricky
could come over here,

38:14.651 --> 38:15.851
not you go over there.

38:15.884 --> 38:18.117
He has a baby. And you know what?

38:18.150 --> 38:21.350
I love that baby, and I love Ricky, and...

38:21.384 --> 38:23.217
Look, I'm sorry for staying out all night,

38:23.250 --> 38:25.717
but I have to say I had a good time.

38:25.751 --> 38:27.784
So just please don't be angry with me.

38:30.317 --> 38:31.384
What?

38:31.417 --> 38:32.584
Tell her.

38:32.617 --> 38:34.150
Tell me what?

38:34.183 --> 38:36.817
I'm not taking the job in New York.

38:36.851 --> 38:39.117
Because we're getting married.

38:39.183 --> 38:42.150
Oh, my God! Mom!

38:42.183 --> 38:44.050
I wanted you to come
home so I could tell you.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.117
So when? When are you gonna do it?

38:46.150 --> 38:48.884
When are we gonna do it? Uh,
whenever you want.

38:48.918 --> 38:50.417
Well, are you gonna have a wedding?

38:50.450 --> 38:52.584
We can have a wedding in the backyard.
A big Mexican wedding.

38:52.617 --> 38:55.551
I'm Colombian. Yeah, well, he's Mexican.

38:55.584 --> 38:56.684
Oh, Ruben, I love you.

38:56.717 --> 38:57.884
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.284
Thank you for talking her into this.

38:59.317 --> 39:01.384
I don't know that I talked her into it.

39:01.417 --> 39:02.751
At least I hope that's not the case.

39:02.784 --> 39:04.817
Well, I was just scared.

39:04.851 --> 39:06.584
Moving into this house scared me.

39:06.617 --> 39:08.083
When I had the opportunity to run,

39:08.117 --> 39:10.250
I had to at least think about it.

39:10.284 --> 39:12.417
Old habits are hard to break.

39:12.450 --> 39:16.018
Yeah. Until you find the one you love.

39:16.050 --> 39:17.217
Yeah.

39:18.417 --> 39:20.617
We both have to settle down. I mean that.

39:20.651 --> 39:23.018
No more messing around, all right?

39:24.817 --> 39:26.284
Hi. Hi.

39:26.317 --> 39:28.784
Don't let me interrupt the lecture.
He needs one.

39:28.817 --> 39:31.417
Bad boy! Bad boy!

39:31.450 --> 39:34.784
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy, Whitey!

39:34.817 --> 39:37.417
His name is Moose, if you're
referring to him. I'm George.

39:37.450 --> 39:39.450
Yeah, I was referring to Moose, George.

39:39.484 --> 39:41.517
He got my little Bella pregnant.

39:41.551 --> 39:45.018
God! Maybe it's something in the soil. What?

39:45.050 --> 39:47.617
Well, you sound surprised,

39:47.651 --> 39:49.517
and yet the dog is not neutered.

39:49.551 --> 39:50.884
Yeah? Neither am I. So?

39:50.918 --> 39:53.050
So the dog should be neutered.

39:53.083 --> 39:56.484
Yeah, I know. The last owner
was supposed to neuter him.

39:56.517 --> 39:58.617
Moose got kicked out of
the seeing eye dog system

39:58.651 --> 40:00.717
partly because he wasn't
neutered and partly because

40:00.751 --> 40:02.117
he has a mind of his own, like me.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.784
Well, as long as you're not
going around the neighborhood

40:03.817 --> 40:05.050
humping everything that moves,

40:05.083 --> 40:07.183
I won't insist that you get neutered.

40:07.217 --> 40:10.918
But the dog, Moose, is another story.

40:10.951 --> 40:12.484
Wait a s-- Are you--

40:12.517 --> 40:14.150
You're George Juergens
from the furniture store.

40:14.183 --> 40:16.851
Who wants to know? I'm Nicky.

40:16.884 --> 40:21.183
You sold me a whole hous
e-load of crap when I moved in.

40:21.217 --> 40:22.851
Oh, yeah. I remember you.

40:22.884 --> 40:25.317
And as I recall, you didn't
have a whole lot of money.

40:25.350 --> 40:28.217
As I recall, I let you take
any crap you took a liking to.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.350
That's right. And I love crap,

40:30.384 --> 40:33.884
but hate your dog.

40:33.918 --> 40:35.250
You're sure she's pregnant?

40:35.284 --> 40:37.484
My vet seems to think so.
I don't know much about it.

40:37.517 --> 40:40.651
I'm just taking care of her
while my sister's away.

40:40.684 --> 40:43.751
She started acting weird, and...

40:43.784 --> 40:45.417
I don't know.

40:45.450 --> 40:48.684
I thought it was kind of nice
that she had a boyfriend.

40:50.551 --> 40:53.651
I'd like a boyfriend.
Well, I'd like to help you out there,

40:53.684 --> 40:55.817
but I'm madly in love with my wife.

41:01.018 --> 41:02.551
Mom?

41:03.918 --> 41:06.018
Hi, Ashley.

41:07.183 --> 41:09.384
It's so good to see you.

41:11.217 --> 41:13.684
Where's Robbie? Oh, he's in the nursery.

41:16.150 --> 41:19.984
So, you're back? No, not really, Ashley.

41:20.018 --> 41:22.851
I was thinking about it, but...

41:22.884 --> 41:26.150
I don't think that it's a
good time for me to come back.

41:26.183 --> 41:29.884
I thought it was, but my mistake.

41:48.417 --> 41:49.884
Oh, no.
