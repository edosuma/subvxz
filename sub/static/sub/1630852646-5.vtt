00:26.120 --> 00:31.960
<i>Taipei is a city
with both traditions and innovations.</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:34.400
There's no conflict.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.560
I think it's integrated very well.

01:19.640 --> 01:23.440
<i>Taiwan is advancing
at the speed of a high-speed rail.</i>

01:24.520 --> 01:26.440
It used to be very conservative
in the past,

01:27.480 --> 01:32.800
<i>but we are now the first country in Asia
to legalize same-sex marriage.</i>

01:33.600 --> 01:37.520
I think Taipei is the most suitable city
to be yourself.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.160
I'm so happy.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.160
STINKY TOFU

02:44.600 --> 02:46.240
One liver, one mix.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.360
SESAME CHICKEN

03:03.600 --> 03:05.120
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.480
May I ask if your dad still does this?

03:07.560 --> 03:09.080
Yes, he's just off today.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.320
OYSTER OMELET, 75, RICE CAKE, 30

04:21.880 --> 04:23.800
<i>The oyster omelet
at Ningxia Night Market is famous,</i>

04:23.880 --> 04:25.399
so I came to try it.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.400
<i>I think its taste</i>

04:30.080 --> 04:31.440
is kind of like a memory.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.720
<i>I've been coming here
since I can remember.</i>

04:34.800 --> 04:35.920
Probably over 30 years.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.560
OLD TAIPEI STORE
YUEN HUAN PIEN OYSTER EGG OMELET

04:38.120 --> 04:39.680
<i>You need to nurture customers.</i>

04:39.760 --> 04:41.640
<i>If you nurture them with this taste</i>

04:42.600 --> 04:44.160
<i>from generation to generation,</i>

04:44.240 --> 04:47.680
<i>they will be attached
to the familiar taste,</i>

04:47.760 --> 04:50.000
and will always return to eat here.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.680
<i>This oyster omelet</i>

04:53.760 --> 04:56.640
<i>has brought me a lot of comfort</i>

04:56.720 --> 04:59.200
<i>and also rewards.</i>

05:01.080 --> 05:02.960
<i>My name is Lai Bing Xun.</i>

05:03.040 --> 05:06.200
I am a food hawker

05:06.280 --> 05:08.360
specializing in oyster egg omelets.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.680
<i>To make an oyster omelet…</i>

05:12.760 --> 05:14.400
<i>Well, a frying pan is a must.</i>

05:16.800 --> 05:18.920
<i>Then you need eggs,</i>

05:19.520 --> 05:24.280
<i>vegetables, Chinese cabbage,
fresh oysters,</i>

05:24.360 --> 05:27.280
<i>and sweet potato starch mixed with water.</i>

05:28.880 --> 05:31.120
<i>It's really crispy.</i>

05:32.600 --> 05:33.720
<i>It's great.</i>

05:33.800 --> 05:35.000
It's the best.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.560
<i>Every day, you must work happily.</i>

05:40.640 --> 05:43.720
At my age, the happier we are, the better.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.520
OYSTER EGG OMELET

05:51.000 --> 05:54.240
<i>It was my second brother
who first came to Ningxia Night Market.</i>

05:54.880 --> 05:57.120
I came to look for him
after serving my military service.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.360
YUAN HUAN PIEN OYSTER EGG OMELET

05:58.440 --> 06:00.240
<i>He told me he wanted to quit.</i>

06:01.320 --> 06:05.360
He asked, "Do you want to take over?
If so, I will pass the stall to you."

06:05.440 --> 06:08.360
"But if you only want
to earn big money and leave,

06:08.440 --> 06:10.080
I suggest you don't work in a stall

06:10.560 --> 06:12.160
because it's very hard."

06:12.960 --> 06:16.920
<i>It has been 52 years
since I took it over from him.</i>

06:21.680 --> 06:24.160
<i>Today, Ningxia Night Market
can be regarded</i>

06:24.240 --> 06:26.880
<i>as one of the top night markets in Taipei.</i>

06:29.360 --> 06:31.880
We went through a lot of setbacks as well.

06:32.680 --> 06:37.240
<i>Twenty years ago, Ningxia Night Market
was just on the side of the street.</i>

06:37.320 --> 06:39.640
<i>It took up a whole roadside,</i>

06:39.720 --> 06:41.480
<i>occupying the shops' walkways.</i>

06:42.080 --> 06:46.200
The stalls made the place look messy,

06:46.280 --> 06:49.360
so the residents here
were a bit against it.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.880
<i>Young people didn't come
to night markets at that time</i>

06:52.960 --> 06:55.720
<i>because the mess was an important factor.</i>

06:56.480 --> 06:59.400
<i>Our municipal administration
came up with a plan</i>

07:00.200 --> 07:05.520
<i>to move the stalls
to the middle of the road.</i>

07:05.600 --> 07:09.080
<i>Someone recommended me as chairman.</i>

07:09.160 --> 07:13.480
To tell you the truth,
it was a big challenge.

07:14.480 --> 07:19.040
<i>Of course, many vendors
didn't agree to move.</i>

07:19.120 --> 07:22.120
<i>Because they had run their businesses
by the roadside</i>

07:22.200 --> 07:25.000
<i>for 30 to 40 years and were settled there.</i>

07:25.680 --> 07:28.320
Nevertheless, I still managed
to complete the task.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.080
<i>We relocated all the vendors
on both sides of the road,</i>

07:33.160 --> 07:36.840
<i>about 180 stalls,</i>

07:36.920 --> 07:39.120
<i>to the middle of the road.</i>

07:40.560 --> 07:41.800
<i>I told our members</i>

07:41.880 --> 07:45.840
<i>to clean their business premises
every day.</i>

07:47.560 --> 07:50.680
<i>And to be very friendly
towards our residents.</i>

07:50.760 --> 07:54.040
<i>When we started planning,
I told the members</i>

07:54.120 --> 07:56.600
<i>not to sell things that are too similar.</i>

07:57.360 --> 07:58.480
<i>You must be innovative.</i>

08:00.800 --> 08:06.600
<i>The process took a year and a half.</i>

08:07.400 --> 08:10.360
<i>This established the culture</i>

08:10.440 --> 08:12.000
<i>of our night market.</i>

08:13.520 --> 08:17.840
<i>We have 150 food stalls
at Ningxia Night Market</i>

08:17.920 --> 08:20.240
<i>and most of them
offer something different.</i>

08:20.720 --> 08:21.600
RONG'S PORK LIVER

08:21.680 --> 08:24.400
Our mixed soup consists of pork liver,

08:24.480 --> 08:28.440
pork broth, and pork stomach.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.520
<i>If I'm selling rice dumplings
and pork liver soup,</i>

08:31.600 --> 08:34.320
<i>the vendor beside me will definitely
not sell the same products.</i>

08:34.400 --> 08:37.400
<i>This is an unspoken rule
in the Ningxia Night Market.</i>

08:41.240 --> 08:42.960
<i>We get a lot of young people.</i>

08:44.080 --> 08:46.159
<i>When young people come,</i>

08:46.240 --> 08:49.080
it means they find a sense of novelty
in this night market.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.000
This is almost done.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.400
<i>My son</i>

08:53.960 --> 08:57.000
<i>has also taken over the stall
for the last 20 years.</i>

08:57.800 --> 08:59.080
<i>I am very grateful to him.</i>

08:59.160 --> 09:02.480
<i>He worked for 50 or 60 years</i>

09:02.560 --> 09:07.040
<i>and gave me this platform
so I can keep working.</i>

09:07.120 --> 09:10.000
I can work hard to raise my kids.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.280
That's pretty good.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.600
-Come by on Friday.
-I know.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.800
<i>Ningxia Night Market is a big family.</i>

09:15.880 --> 09:17.440
I saw the queue for your stall…

09:17.520 --> 09:21.560
-The queue has already reached this place.
-No.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.920
<i>The human touch in night markets
is Taiwan's most beautiful scenery.</i>

09:27.480 --> 09:30.000
It enables me to live and work here
in peace and contentment,

09:30.080 --> 09:32.920
to form my own family,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.440
<i>and to lead a stable life.</i>

09:35.520 --> 09:39.000
Therefore, I spare no effort
in giving back to this night market.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.720
<i>The night market changed me</i>

09:41.800 --> 09:43.040
and I changed the night market.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.120
We complement each other.

09:55.880 --> 10:01.080
<i>Taipei at night is like fireworks to me.</i>

10:01.160 --> 10:02.280
<i>It is splendid,</i>

10:03.440 --> 10:05.280
but it disappears very quickly.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.440
But when nighttime arrives,

10:06.520 --> 10:10.120
the fireworks will appear again
and there will be a different feeling.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.680
THE RED HOUSE

10:15.000 --> 10:20.280
<i>I believe the whole of Taiwan in the past
has been quite conservative and less open.</i>

10:22.160 --> 10:26.600
<i>But I feel that in the last 30 years,
the changes have been very big.</i>

10:28.400 --> 10:32.760
Everyone has cultivated the good habit
of discussing issues.

10:34.400 --> 10:39.120
<i>We may not see eye to eye,
but we can still discuss with each other.</i>

10:41.400 --> 10:44.760
<i>We just want society
to become more diverse,</i>

10:44.840 --> 10:45.960
<i>more fun,</i>

10:46.040 --> 10:48.560
<i>so that life would not be so serious.</i>

10:48.640 --> 10:51.120
There can be a lot more fun in life.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.560
<i>Ximending is a vibrant place,
but if you go behind The Red House,</i>

11:06.640 --> 11:09.080
<i>you will find a different world.</i>

11:12.840 --> 11:15.760
<i>The Red House is a really special place.</i>

11:15.840 --> 11:19.480
<i>It's an LGBT-friendly zone.</i>

11:20.720 --> 11:22.520
<i>Some might be on the hunt,</i>

11:22.600 --> 11:25.560
<i>but people mostly visit The Red House</i>

11:25.640 --> 11:27.680
<i>just to drink,</i>

11:27.760 --> 11:30.920
<i>to enjoy chatting, and to be themselves.</i>

11:36.720 --> 11:38.520
<i>I am Yolanda Mesula,</i>

11:38.600 --> 11:41.600
<i>a Taiwanese drag queen.</i>

11:41.680 --> 11:45.600
<i>As of now, I've been doing this
for four or five years.</i>

11:46.280 --> 11:48.080
I think I'm like a spark.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.280
I'm the one that ignites the fireworks

11:50.360 --> 11:54.960
and the role I play is to make everyone
feel bright and happy.

11:56.600 --> 12:02.040
<i>Tonight, we are holding a competition
called the Taiwan Drag Talent Show.</i>

12:02.120 --> 12:06.680
<i>Today, we've invited four of Taiwan's
new generation of drag queens</i>

12:08.320 --> 12:11.200
<i>and also a special guest called Dan Dan.</i>

16:08.000 --> 16:12.080
<i>When I see the night view of Taipei,
I just think about the places I can paint.</i>

16:12.720 --> 16:14.920
It's just so simple.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.280
<i>My name is Mr. Black Rooster.
They call me Ogay.</i>

16:20.360 --> 16:23.000
It has been my nickname since high school.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.080
<i>Once, I was talking
while the teacher was at the blackboard.</i>

16:28.160 --> 16:30.360
He suddenly turned and yelled,

16:30.440 --> 16:32.280
"Why can I hear a rooster crowing?"

16:32.360 --> 16:35.160
They've called me
Black Rooster ever since.

16:37.040 --> 16:42.720
<i>I've been doing street art creation
for about 20 years.</i>

16:42.800 --> 16:45.080
<i>I've been doing it in Taiwan.</i>

16:49.200 --> 16:51.760
<i>The night is colorful and interesting,</i>

16:51.840 --> 16:53.960
<i>so it makes me want to go out</i>

16:54.040 --> 16:55.520
and see lots of things.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.560
<i>When I was young,
I loved wandering around.</i>

17:05.640 --> 17:07.320
<i>At night,
I would visit all sorts of places.</i>

17:10.480 --> 17:13.319
<i>Sometimes, I secretly went to paint
at different places in Taipei.</i>

17:15.160 --> 17:19.640
I usually did it during the night
because there were fewer people.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.359
I could finish it and get away quickly.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.599
<i>Painting here feels peaceful.</i>

17:29.680 --> 17:32.400
<i>It's the reason
why I like working amongst ruins.</i>

17:33.640 --> 17:37.640
I'm going to paint a fat crying face

17:39.000 --> 17:42.520
<i>because I just got a notification
that my daughter is waiting for me.</i>

17:42.600 --> 17:44.120
<i>I'm not home yet, so she keeps crying.</i>

17:44.200 --> 17:48.120
So I'm thinking
that I should paint a crying person.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.600
It's just perfect timing.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.840
<i>Most people think
that beauty is mainstream.</i>

17:57.120 --> 18:01.200
<i>Sometimes, I'll deliberately do it
in a nonmainstream way</i>

18:01.280 --> 18:04.240
<i>because the mainstream way
is already very popular.</i>

18:05.200 --> 18:09.800
But I feel only ugliness
can make a deep impression.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.160
<i>So I make my characters
as ugly as possible.</i>

18:15.800 --> 18:16.960
<i>I make it ugly.</i>

18:17.960 --> 18:21.360
<i>Then in the end,
the image of this fatty appeared.</i>

18:25.840 --> 18:27.120
<i>It's like my kid.</i>

18:27.200 --> 18:31.840
And it's a lot of fun having my kid
show up in different parts of the city.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.200
<i>I used to paint because it was fun
and it was for my enjoyment.</i>

18:40.280 --> 18:45.560
I never thought
I would make it my life career.

18:54.840 --> 18:58.400
<i>This graffiti street
wasn't like this before.</i>

18:58.480 --> 19:00.920
<i>It was just a common road</i>

19:01.000 --> 19:03.880
<i>and not many people would come here</i>

19:03.960 --> 19:05.720
because they thought
there was nothing here.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.960
<i>Graffiti artists
used to paint everywhere randomly.</i>

19:09.040 --> 19:10.960
<i>It was a problem for the city council</i>

19:11.040 --> 19:13.800
<i>because they were always spending
a lot of money to clean it up.</i>

19:16.080 --> 19:18.080
A friend of mine suggested

19:18.160 --> 19:21.640
they save that money
and fund some of us artists instead.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.160
<i>And we'll help to lay wooden planks.
We'll help to manage it.</i>

19:26.720 --> 19:30.520
<i>It would beautify the area
while giving artists somewhere to paint.</i>

19:30.600 --> 19:33.440
<i>It would also attract people,</i>

19:34.080 --> 19:36.160
so it would be a win-win situation.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.720
<i>Ximending is an example
of how graffiti has transformed an area</i>

19:46.800 --> 19:49.120
<i>into somewhere more people want to visit.</i>

20:04.240 --> 20:07.200
Do you think I can give it a go?

20:07.280 --> 20:09.480
You can go closer. Closer.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.000
Everyone who sees my work
says it's very <i>tai</i>.

20:13.680 --> 20:19.080
When I was young,
this word used to be a bit derogatory.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.040
<i>People said someone was</i> tai

20:22.120 --> 20:28.560
<i>to mean they were not
very hip or attractive</i>

20:28.640 --> 20:30.200
<i>and that they are provincial.</i>

20:32.800 --> 20:36.800
<i>But nowadays,
people have a new take on it.</i>

20:36.880 --> 20:38.240
Being <i>tai</i> is something good.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.600
It means that a person is from this place

20:40.680 --> 20:44.480
and loves the place where they grew up.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.480
<i>The night of Taipei</i>

20:47.560 --> 20:50.640
has given me a lot of inspiration.

21:30.360 --> 21:34.200
I will make
the classic version of espresso.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.520
So actually,
there's a double espresso inside.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.560
I need to get up early tomorrow

21:47.640 --> 21:49.160
-so I shouldn't.
-We want you to be awake.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.400
-Are you awake now?
-Yes, I am.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.880
<i>When many people hear about Indulge,</i>

22:11.960 --> 22:15.400
they would say,
"Indulge? It comes from Taiwan."

22:15.480 --> 22:16.920
It was difficult at the beginning.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.440
<i>Ten years ago, when I opened Indulge,</i>

22:24.520 --> 22:27.360
Taipei was not a city
with a developed cocktail scene.

22:27.440 --> 22:31.440
<i>Even the professional bartenders then</i>

22:31.520 --> 22:34.240
<i>didn't know what classic cocktails were.</i>

22:34.320 --> 22:37.400
So Indulge didn't do well
during the first two years.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.200
<i>Most alcohols in most bars at that time
were foreign products.</i>

22:44.560 --> 22:47.560
<i>Through flavors
that people haven't tasted,</i>

22:47.640 --> 22:50.040
I want to introduce
that we are from Taiwan.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.640
<i>I wanted to make my cocktails
with my nation's spirit.</i>

22:54.720 --> 22:58.560
This one is quite subtle
so there's a special cup of Baozhong tea.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.520
Yes, you can cleanse your palate first.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.440
<i>I found that tea drinking
had become really popular.</i>

23:05.520 --> 23:10.080
This looks like a tea ceremony,
but you're drinking alcohol.

23:10.160 --> 23:15.520
<i>In the past, only the rich could enjoy tea
and gave it as gifts.</i>

23:16.480 --> 23:17.520
That's really amazing.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.480
But nobody was adding tea to cocktails.

23:29.240 --> 23:33.160
<i>The city of Taipei is really close
to both the mountains and the sea,</i>

23:34.000 --> 23:38.840
so it allows me to find many materials
to create cocktails.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.560
<i>In Taiwan, there are ferns
not found anywhere else on earth.</i>

23:56.160 --> 24:00.280
I'll use these ferns
to express the vision I have for my drink.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.800
<i>I started to study tea</i>

24:10.880 --> 24:13.360
<i>and how tea could be mixed with alcohol</i>

24:13.440 --> 24:17.720
<i>to keep its special fragrance
as the main flavor.</i>

24:19.240 --> 24:20.800
<i>It was difficult at the beginning</i>

24:20.880 --> 24:25.040
<i>because most people
just drink cupped tea or bottled tea.</i>

24:26.040 --> 24:30.800
<i>Today, we are using Cuiyu tea leaves
mixed with jasmine flowers.</i>

24:30.880 --> 24:32.640
<i>It's like drinking soup.</i>

24:34.000 --> 24:35.440
<i>We suck it in.</i>

24:35.520 --> 24:37.280
<i>It reacts with the air</i>

24:37.800 --> 24:40.920
and lands lightly on the senses.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.560
<i>Basically, tea leaves
won't produce any bad results.</i>

24:50.360 --> 24:53.680
<i>I named this cocktail Sleepless Dawn</i>

24:53.760 --> 24:56.280
<i>because I wanted to present
a three-way conversation</i>

24:56.360 --> 24:58.560
<i>between me as an individual,
the city, and nature</i>

24:58.640 --> 25:00.160
<i>in this glass.</i>

25:00.760 --> 25:05.640
<i>The color represents the dawn or sunset.</i>

25:05.720 --> 25:07.640
<i>It's the view
when we're looking at the city</i>

25:07.720 --> 25:09.040
<i>from the top of the mountain.</i>

25:11.040 --> 25:14.120
<i>We're going to introduce it to the city</i>

25:14.200 --> 25:15.880
to give it a new life.

25:24.600 --> 25:30.960
For me, creating a cocktail in Taipei
through the lens of nature

25:31.040 --> 25:34.760
is something very simple
and it makes me happy.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.040
<i>And now,</i>

25:42.120 --> 25:44.560
<i>I'm very proud and happy</i>

25:44.640 --> 25:46.560
<i>that with all our efforts,</i>

25:46.640 --> 25:50.320
Taipei has become one
of the most famous cities for cocktails.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.960
Please keep walking on your own path
towards your goal.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.840
The competition I'm hosting today
is quite special.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.880
It's a drag competition.

27:28.400 --> 27:32.960
<i>It's special because I want everyone
to show off their talent</i>

27:33.040 --> 27:34.440
<i>and not lip-sync.</i>

27:36.600 --> 27:39.400
-Hello.
-Hello, Dan Dan.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.600
Hi. Are you all right?

27:40.680 --> 27:42.360
-Fine.
-Still okay, right?

27:42.440 --> 27:43.760
You haven't put on makeup yet, right?

27:43.840 --> 27:45.680
-That's right.
-You need to hurry with your makeup.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.360
<i>To them, drag is a method of expression.</i>

28:02.440 --> 28:05.840
I agree with that
because drag lets you break away

28:05.920 --> 28:08.280
from what you originally look like

28:08.360 --> 28:10.120
and present yourself artistically.

28:10.680 --> 28:11.760
Are you nervous?

28:11.840 --> 28:13.160
-Yes.
-A little bit?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.760
-Slightly.
-Slightly?

28:14.840 --> 28:16.360
-Just a tad too nervous.
-What?

28:16.440 --> 28:17.800
But today,

28:17.880 --> 28:19.600
everyone is a drag queen.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.360
-Yes.
-And you are the only one

28:21.440 --> 28:23.240
with a different identity, right?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.320
It's usually fine,

28:36.400 --> 28:38.920
but just sometimes…

28:39.000 --> 28:42.480
It's because drag kings and queens
perform really differently.

28:42.560 --> 28:44.160
<i>I don't think it's a problem.</i>

28:44.240 --> 28:46.720
<i>The performances are different,
but the spirit is the same.</i>

28:52.960 --> 28:55.080
On the journey of drag,

28:55.160 --> 29:01.120
I think it's important
to have a teacher or mentor.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.720
<i>Because in the beginning,</i>

29:02.800 --> 29:05.040
<i>people can have
a lot of misconceptions about drag.</i>

29:28.280 --> 29:32.480
I think for today,
you should just have fun.

29:44.640 --> 29:49.400
Today's 2020 Drag Talent Show
is about to start.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.000
Everyone, give yourselves a shout.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.440
Please enjoy the stage and have fun.

29:59.520 --> 30:03.280
Don't be too nervous
because I can see it if you are.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.240
In saying that, do you feel more nervous?

30:05.320 --> 30:07.400
Please just do your best.

30:32.960 --> 30:38.000
Let's welcome our contestant, Dan Dan!

31:02.000 --> 31:05.840
Okay, is there anything
to tell the audience

31:05.920 --> 31:08.600
about your rather manly look today?

31:08.680 --> 31:13.000
I want to break everyone's conception
of gender binary.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.000
Dan Dan!

32:40.960 --> 32:42.960
<i>I hope everyone can give Dan Dan
some encouragement.</i>

32:43.040 --> 32:46.160
I really love Dan Dan's spirit

32:46.240 --> 32:47.720
-and courage to break through.
-Yes.

32:48.640 --> 32:53.520
Also, I admire Dan Dan's courage
to show a different side.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.600
I think…

32:54.680 --> 32:57.640
I think their existence
surpasses their performance.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.360
Dan Dan's existence shows everyone
that there are different existences.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.600
Everyone, please give Dan Dan
a round of applause, all right?

33:03.680 --> 33:04.720
Thank you.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.720
-Hey.
-Hey.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.960
<i>I think Taiwan is a very diversified place</i>

33:53.040 --> 33:56.600
and everything can have its place here.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.480
<i>Many traditions have survived until now</i>

34:00.560 --> 34:03.320
<i>thanks to the efforts
of those preserving them.</i>

34:03.400 --> 34:08.440
But these traditions are also ready
to change with the times.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.480
This is a gift.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.000
I'm so happy.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.639
Taipei is a city

34:15.719 --> 34:19.679
that is charming and tolerant.

34:20.400 --> 34:24.760
<i>Here, you can always find the next thing
that makes you happy</i>

34:25.320 --> 34:28.880
and another reason
to fall in love with it again.
