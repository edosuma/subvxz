00:03.967 --> 00:05.734
Nós somos o que você chama de especialistas.

00:05.736 --> 00:07.135
Não é?

00:07.137 --> 00:10.005
<i>Neste episódio de Mythbusters...</i>

00:11.307 --> 00:14.242
...Adam e Jamie estão
estão transbordando de adrenalina...

00:14.244 --> 00:16.378
Isso foi magnífico!

00:16.379 --> 00:19.648
...testando esse vídeo da internet

00:19.650 --> 00:21.216
<i>Isso!! Nós conseguimos!</i>

00:21.218 --> 00:23.385
Pode o plástico bolha...

00:23.387 --> 00:25.120
Ciência é perigoso!

00:25.122 --> 00:29.257
...Nos proteger de uma queda de mais de 35 metros?

00:29.259 --> 00:31.126
<i> Você estaria completamente morto</i>

00:31.128 --> 00:34.062
Enquanto isso, Kari, Grant e Tory
vão ficar de cabeça para baixo...

00:34.064 --> 00:35.364
Aah!

00:35.898 --> 00:37.399
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:38.935 --> 00:40.936
...causando confusões no Bond-Car.

00:40.938 --> 00:44.573
Ei, James, tem muita
coisa acontecendo aqui agora.

00:44.575 --> 00:46.508
Pode um assento ejetável...

00:46.510 --> 00:49.978
Esta é a coisa mais perigosa que eu já construí.

00:49.980 --> 00:51.780
<i> Virar um carro capotado?</i>

00:51.782 --> 00:53.649
<i>Fazendo o ficar novamente sobre suas quatro rodas?</i>

00:59.489 --> 01:01.390
Quem são os MythBusters?

01:02.392 --> 01:03.792
Adam Savage...

01:03.794 --> 01:05.560
<i>Isso é ciência em ação!</i>

01:05.562 --> 01:07.295

- Bem, a julgar pelo fato de que
temos este plástico bolha

01:41.932 --> 01:43.331
por todo lugar, eu posso pressentir

01:43.333 --> 01:46.234
que alguém fez alguma coisa
realmente estúpida com ele

01:46.236 --> 01:47.703
- Você está absolutamente correto

01:47.705 --> 01:50.672
O que temos é um vídeo viral
onde um cara se enrola

01:50.674 --> 01:53.275
em muito plástico bolha

01:53.277 --> 01:55.410
e pula de um prédio de três andares

01:55.412 --> 01:58.513
e no final da queda
sai aparentemente ileso

01:58.515 --> 02:00.148
- Bem, o plástico é projetado para amortecer as coisas.

02:00.150 --> 02:01.583
- Sim, ele é

02:03.019 --> 02:06.455
O plástico bolha foi criado pra amortecer impacto em transportes de produtos

02:06.457 --> 02:08.023
<i>Dê um palpite de sorte</i>

02:08.025 --> 02:09.925
Mas será proteção o bastante para

02:09.926 --> 02:12.794
uma queda de mais de 35metros?

02:12.796 --> 02:13.895
<i>Whoa!</i>

02:13.897 --> 02:15.297
Em outras palavras

02:15.299 --> 02:18.867
Esse vídeo será real ou montagem?

02:18.869 --> 02:21.803
<i>Isso! Conseguimos!</i>

02:21.805 --> 02:23.105
- Obviamente, em algum momento

02:23.107 --> 02:25.774
Um de nós vai ter
que se enrolar em plástico bolha

02:25.776 --> 02:27.209
e pular de um prédio

02:27.211 --> 02:29.211
Mas eu tenho preocupações sobre a segurança na realização disso

02:29.213 --> 02:30.612
Como você pretende fazer isso?

02:30.614 --> 02:32.013
- Eu acho que podemos

02:32.015 --> 02:34.049
iniciar nossos testes
com o Buster no nosso lugar

02:34.051 --> 02:36.084
Vamos refazer exatamente

02:36.086 --> 02:37.486
o que vemos no vídeo...

02:37.488 --> 02:40.122
envolvendo o Buster na 
mesma quantidade de plástico bolha

02:40.124 --> 02:42.157
e jogá-lo de um prédio da mesma altura

02:42.159 --> 02:44.826
Vamos colocar alguns acelerômetros
em seu corpo e ver se ele vai sair vivo

02:44.828 --> 02:46.762
Tudo bem pra mim, vamos lá!

02:46.764 --> 02:49.231
<i> Então, vamos recriar o que vemos</i>

02:49.233 --> 02:52.701
No vídeo deste mito.
Adam, Jamie, e Buster

02:52.703 --> 02:54.503
Vão para seu campo de teste favorito

02:54.505 --> 02:55.937
- Hoje, nós estamos

02:55.939 --> 02:58.273
em centro militar desativado
em San Francisco 

02:58.275 --> 03:00.108
E essa não é a nossa primeira vez aqui

03:00.110 --> 03:01.743
Estivemos aqui testando um outro mito

03:01.745 --> 03:03.945
que era o "Caindo nos toldos".. que fizemos bem abaixo de onde estou

03:03.947 --> 03:05.046
Aah!

03:05.048 --> 03:06.681
...

03:06.683 --> 03:09.217
- Hoje, vamos testar o mito do "Garoto Bolha"

03:09.219 --> 03:11.286
No vídeo, o jovem pula de mais de 23metros de altura

03:11.288 --> 03:12.988
E cai de costas

03:12.990 --> 03:15.957
E ele estava envolvido em 4cm de plástico bolha

03:15.959 --> 03:17.492
Agora, para nos dizer

03:17.494 --> 03:20.061
o quanto efetivo é o plástico bolha

03:20.063 --> 03:21.329
Nós precisamos fazer o primeiro teste de controle

03:21.331 --> 03:23.899
que significa que vamos
jogar o Buster primeiramente

03:23.901 --> 03:26.234
da mesma altura que vamos testar,
mas sem plástico bolha

03:26.236 --> 03:28.470
E ver o que nossos sensores vão registrar

03:28.472 --> 03:32.774
<i>Então o Buster vai encarar
duas vezes a queda de 3 andares</i>

03:32.776 --> 03:34.743
<i> Primeiro,ele vai despencar sem 
a proteção do plástico bolha</i>

03:34.745 --> 03:38.880
<i>e depois ele vai despencar
totalmente envolvido com plastico bolha</i>

03:38.882 --> 03:40.982
- Agora, como faremos para comparar as duas quedas?

03:40.984 --> 03:42.083
Com isso!

03:42.085 --> 03:44.052
Isso é um acelerômetro

03:44.054 --> 03:47.289
e ele pode fazer a leitura de impacto de até 5.000G

03:47.291 --> 03:50.225
Isso deve nos dar
uma clara comparação das duas quedas

03:50.227 --> 03:52.994
Com o Buster protegido
e com o Buster desprotegido

03:52.996 --> 03:54.629
<i> E esse é o plano...</i>

03:54.631 --> 03:57.132
<i>Então o Adam corta o Buster e insere os sensores nele</i>

03:57.134 --> 03:59.734
- Acho que você está pronto, Buster

03:59.736 --> 04:02.070
<i> Buster é erguido a 35metros de altura</i>

04:02.072 --> 04:03.572
- Parece perfeito!

04:03.574 --> 04:05.740
<i>... E assume sua posição...</i>

04:05.742 --> 04:07.876
- Pobre Buster
- Pobre Buster

04:07.878 --> 04:08.944
- Aqui vamos nós

04:08.946 --> 04:12.514
Buster no teste de controle, 35metros de altura

04:12.516 --> 04:14.883
Em 3, 2, 1.

04:14.885 --> 04:16.117
Oh.

04:16.119 --> 04:17.685
Nice.

04:17.688 --> 04:18.920
A perfect hit.

04:18.922 --> 04:20.822
He stayed together in one piece.

04:20.824 --> 04:21.857
He totally did.

04:21.858 --> 04:24.860
Yep, if there's one thing Buster can do...

04:25.795 --> 04:28.063
...it's stick a landing.

04:28.065 --> 04:29.931
Adam: A perfect hit.

04:29.933 --> 04:32.234
Buster's control drop
went off without a hitch.

04:32.236 --> 04:33.702
Feels like old times.

04:33.704 --> 04:37.839
He hit the target from 35 feet,
he landed, he flipped over.

04:37.841 --> 04:40.408
Now we've got to see how many
G's he pulled when he hit.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.644
Jamie: What did we get?

04:42.646 --> 04:44.980
Well, Buster falling flat onto
the ground with no protection,

04:44.982 --> 04:48.583
the accelerometer says
that he took 300 G's.

04:48.585 --> 04:50.719
- Lethal.
- Absolutely lethal.

04:50.721 --> 04:52.721
Like, four times your average
severe car accident

04:52.723 --> 04:53.755
kind of lethal.

04:53.757 --> 04:56.057
Narrator: Adam's not exaggerating.

04:56.059 --> 05:00.262
With no protection,
Buster's drop was a disaster,

05:00.264 --> 05:04.366
and he smacked the sidewalk at 300 G's.

05:04.368 --> 05:06.968
Jamie: With all this talk
about G's and G-loads,

05:06.970 --> 05:08.870
you may be wondering what a "G" is.

05:08.872 --> 05:11.806
Well, a "G" is one earth's gravity.

05:11.808 --> 05:15.777
So, when we say that
Buster's experiencing 300 G's,

05:15.779 --> 05:18.513
that means he's experiencing a stress

05:18.515 --> 05:22.050
300 times as large as the earth's gravity,

05:22.052 --> 05:23.585
and that's a lot.

05:23.587 --> 05:25.153
Narrator: It sure is.

05:25.155 --> 05:26.454
A 300-G impact

05:26.456 --> 05:29.724
is like being slammed
by a speeding cement truck.

05:29.726 --> 05:33.662
But will that be the same
when bound in bubbles?

05:33.664 --> 05:34.829
To match the viral video,

05:34.831 --> 05:38.233
Buster is carefully cocooned
in bubble pack...

05:38.235 --> 05:40.535
- Hold on a second. I'm getting dizzy.
- Me, too.

05:40.537 --> 05:42.804
...until the protective packing
is four inches thick.

05:42.806 --> 05:46.007
Jamie: So, it's pretty obvious
that if we start to add padding,

05:46.009 --> 05:48.276
we're going to be reducing the impact

05:48.278 --> 05:50.812
by slowing down
the deceleration process...

05:50.814 --> 05:53.181
that meeting of Buster and the pavement.

05:53.183 --> 05:56.084
The question is,
is four inches of padding enough

05:56.086 --> 06:00.622
to reduce that deceleration
to where Buster would survive?

06:00.624 --> 06:02.123
I don't think so.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.392
Narrator: With Buster easy prey,

06:04.394 --> 06:06.328
buried up to his neck in bubbles,

06:06.330 --> 06:09.130
it's time for him to make
his 35-foot leap of faith.

06:09.132 --> 06:10.465
All right.

06:10.467 --> 06:13.134
Buster falling from 35 feet
in bubble packaging.

06:13.136 --> 06:14.169
3...
Come on, Buster.

06:14.171 --> 06:15.904
...2, 1.

06:15.906 --> 06:17.839
Go.

06:17.841 --> 06:18.740
[ Laughs ]

06:18.742 --> 06:20.308
That was a satisfying thud.

06:20.310 --> 06:22.444
I don't think it was a survivable thud,

06:22.446 --> 06:24.112
but it was satisfying.

06:24.114 --> 06:28.083
Buster bounced,
but did he burst his own bubble?

06:28.085 --> 06:29.851
With all of this extra padding,

06:29.853 --> 06:33.855
we dropped Buster's maximum
g-load from 300 G's to 260 G's.

06:33.857 --> 06:36.491
He's still totally and utterly dead.

06:36.493 --> 06:38.493
Yeah, he's gonna need
a lot more padding than this

06:38.495 --> 06:39.761
to survive that fall.

06:39.763 --> 06:41.363
Narrator: Indeed, he is.

06:41.365 --> 06:45.000
While four inches of bubbles
did reduce Buster's G-load,

06:45.002 --> 06:48.203
he's still three and a half
times over the lethal limit.

06:48.205 --> 06:50.338
So, Buster's dead falling naked

06:50.340 --> 06:52.607
and dead falling wrapped in bubble pack,

06:52.609 --> 06:54.376
where does that leave us?

06:54.378 --> 06:55.910
Well, I can't help but think

06:55.912 --> 06:58.179
that with enough of this stuff,
sooner or later, you'd be safe.

06:58.181 --> 07:00.048
I totally agree.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.650
Let's head back to the shop and see how much
it would take for him to survive this fall.

07:02.652 --> 07:05.086
More bubble trouble. I like it.

07:08.457 --> 07:12.227
Next up, it's time
to be shaken and stirred.

07:14.196 --> 07:16.598
All right, so, we have a myth
that involves ejector seats,

07:16.600 --> 07:19.267
missiles, and James Bond.

07:19.269 --> 07:21.503
Sounds like the perfect combination to me.

07:21.505 --> 07:23.505
Yeah, it's from the movie where he has a
car chase right across a frozen lake.

07:23.507 --> 07:25.940
Something goes horribly wrong,
and boom, car's upside down.

07:25.942 --> 07:28.777
Right, and that gives
the bad guy time to pull over,

07:28.779 --> 07:31.646
line up his car, and fire
his on-board car missiles.

07:31.648 --> 07:33.848
Just as you think
James Bond is a sitting duck,

07:33.850 --> 07:36.317
at the last minute, he pushes
the passenger ejector seat,

07:36.319 --> 07:38.319
and poof, shoots the seat
through the roof.

07:38.321 --> 07:40.655
Oh, and that amount of force
imparted on the ground

07:40.657 --> 07:43.525
causes the car to flip
back over, and he drives away.

07:43.527 --> 07:45.427
This could be the best James Bond myth

07:45.429 --> 07:46.828
we've ever tested.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.397
Narrator: Upside down with nowhere to go,

07:49.399 --> 07:52.534
007 seems down for the count,
but by deploying

07:52.536 --> 07:54.969
his rocket-powered passenger hot seat,

07:54.971 --> 07:57.205
he flips his way to freedom.

07:57.207 --> 08:01.543
But is this rocketry real,
or is this myth on thin ice?

08:01.545 --> 08:03.978
Okay, so, all we need
is an upside-down sports car

08:03.980 --> 08:06.181
and a rocket-powered ejector seat.

08:06.183 --> 08:09.084
Well, see, the ejector seat
could be a problem.

08:09.086 --> 08:11.286
Since we don't know exactly
what Q's design involved,

08:11.288 --> 08:12.854
it could be some high-powered thing

08:12.856 --> 08:14.923
that launches people
hundreds of feet in the air.

08:14.925 --> 08:16.791
Or it could be a low-key ejector seat...

08:16.793 --> 08:18.860
you know, enough to send
the bad guy out of the car.

08:18.862 --> 08:20.995
Well, if you look at
the footage, when it deploys,

08:20.997 --> 08:22.630
you see just a little bit of flame.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.165
Now, with a big ejector seat,

08:24.167 --> 08:26.601
you'd imagine you'd see
this huge fireball after it,

08:26.603 --> 08:27.902
and that's not what we see,

08:27.904 --> 08:29.637
so I'm guessing probably the latter.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.372
Something that ejected, like, 25 feet?

08:31.374 --> 08:32.640
Yeah.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.208
And then we find out
what that rocket thrust is.

08:34.211 --> 08:36.410
- We flip the car and test the myth.
- Great.

08:36.413 --> 08:38.712
[ Tires screech ]
Narrator: So, first up,

08:38.715 --> 08:42.049
the MythBusters need
a top-of-the-range Bond-mobile.

08:42.052 --> 08:44.419
I don't know about you,
but I feel like a spy.

08:44.421 --> 08:46.154
But they got this.

08:46.156 --> 08:49.824
Yes, Mr. President, we'll be right there.

08:49.826 --> 08:51.726
After doing a little bit of research,

08:51.728 --> 08:53.561
even to find a used and trashed car

08:53.563 --> 08:57.765
like the one in the Bond film,
we were talking about $100,000.

08:57.767 --> 09:00.902
This one's a little more
in our price range,

09:00.904 --> 09:03.938
and we chose this car because
it has a similar curb weight...

09:03.940 --> 09:05.340
it's 4,000 pounds...

09:05.342 --> 09:07.709
and we can actually create
the same weight distribution,

to Bond's movie machine,

09:15.018 --> 09:17.685

09:20.223 --> 09:21.656
So, to test this myth properly,

09:21.658 --> 09:23.992
we have to make some
modifications to our vehicle.

09:23.994 --> 09:28.163
One, we're pulling out
the pre-existing passenger seat.

09:28.165 --> 09:30.131
Then we are cutting open
the sunroof bigger

09:30.133 --> 09:32.600
so that it allows a chair
with a person sitting in it

09:32.602 --> 09:34.502
to be ejected.

09:36.472 --> 09:37.605
That was easy.

09:37.607 --> 09:38.907
And then, finally,

09:38.909 --> 09:42.143
we're introducing our own
rocket-powered ejector seat.

a rocket guide rail into place

plate to the floor of the car

for a couple of reasons.

09:55.892 --> 09:58.760
[ Laughs ] It fits perfectly!

09:58.762 --> 10:01.129
We don't want the rocket to burn
through the bottom of the car,

10:01.131 --> 10:02.597
we want to contain all of the thrust,

10:02.599 --> 10:04.599
and is will give us a weight distribution

10:04.601 --> 10:07.202
that's balanced just like
the car from the movie clip.

10:07.204 --> 10:09.404

10:09.406 --> 10:10.939

Now, there's wheels on the back of
the chair that hook into a rail.

That way, he stays on line

10:21.051 --> 10:23.551
as the rockets thrust him
upwards and out of the car.

is attach the rocket to it,

If it works, then we're gonna
flip the car over

will actually flip the car

bare minimum of rocket power

18:15.080 --> 18:17.681
that we needed
to get Buster out of the car,

18:17.683 --> 18:20.150
so the bad guy, he'd be out of the car,

18:20.152 --> 18:23.587
but your good guy,
he'd be toast, literally.

18:23.589 --> 18:24.721
Narrator: Yeah.

18:24.723 --> 18:26.289
The test does highlight

18:26.291 --> 18:29.359
the flaw of using rockets
in enclosed spaces,

18:29.361 --> 18:32.029
but what's more important is
that it's mission accomplished.

18:32.031 --> 18:34.464
Kari: We achieved everything
we wanted with this test.

18:34.466 --> 18:36.600
We have enough thrust
to get Buster out of the car,

18:36.602 --> 18:38.335
we got simultaneous emission,

18:38.337 --> 18:40.804
and we got the 20 feet, even 30 feet,

18:40.806 --> 18:42.372
that we were looking for.

18:42.374 --> 18:44.141
Now is the fun part.

18:44.143 --> 18:47.277
We see if this actually has
enough to flip the car.

18:47.279 --> 18:49.146
Narrator: In other words,

18:49.148 --> 18:52.849
it's time for this myth
to get turned on its head.

18:58.990 --> 19:00.591
Just to recap, we are testing the
myth from the "James Bond" movie,

19:00.593 --> 19:03.127
where if a car's upside down,
and you use the ejector seat,

19:03.129 --> 19:05.362
you can flip that car back on its wheels.

19:05.364 --> 19:07.931
So far, we successfully made
an ejector seat

19:07.933 --> 19:09.300
by using four rockets.

19:09.302 --> 19:12.069
That gave us enough thrust
to get a man out of the car.

19:13.638 --> 19:15.272
But now, is that thrust gonna be enough

19:15.274 --> 19:17.675
to flip a car back on its wheels?

19:17.677 --> 19:19.810
Narrator: To find out just that,

19:19.812 --> 19:22.479
Tory carefully installs
four identical rockets

19:22.481 --> 19:26.083
before an even more delicate
operation must take place...

19:26.085 --> 19:27.418
inverting their Bond-mobile.

19:27.420 --> 19:28.786
Kari: All right.

19:28.788 --> 19:32.656
It's a flippin' unusual method
for flopping a car.

19:32.658 --> 19:36.794
But through a combination of tug-of-war...

19:36.796 --> 19:38.529
Backing up. Lowering.

19:38.531 --> 19:41.031
Narrator: ...machine muscle...

19:41.033 --> 19:43.534
and Tory holding the blue rope,

19:43.536 --> 19:46.337
the guys slowly inch the car
into position...

19:46.339 --> 19:48.205
This is very exciting.

19:48.207 --> 19:51.075
Narrator:
...until finally, we have touchdown.

19:51.077 --> 19:53.444
Perfect.

19:53.446 --> 19:56.213
So, Q built a rocket-powered ejector seat

19:56.215 --> 19:58.716
for James Bond's car, and so did we.

19:58.718 --> 20:01.819
The only problem is that it
only takes 800 pounds of thrust

20:01.821 --> 20:03.921
to get a guy out of a car.

20:03.923 --> 20:06.190
That is a 4,000 pound car.

20:06.192 --> 20:08.826
800 pounds of thrust...

20:08.828 --> 20:11.161
I'm sorry,
but it's not gonna flip the car.

20:11.163 --> 20:13.697
In fact, I barely think
it's even gonna move it.

20:13.699 --> 20:17.434
Narrator:
Grant is firmly in the "Dr. No" camp,

20:17.436 --> 20:19.636
but you can "Never Say Never."

20:19.638 --> 20:22.373
All right. This is ejector-seat car flip.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.275
Here we go in 3, 2, 1.

20:25.277 --> 20:26.744
Fire.

20:30.482 --> 20:32.549
[ Laughs ]

20:32.551 --> 20:34.351
That was a little underwhelming.

20:34.353 --> 20:36.620
Yeah. It looks like
four just isn't enough.

20:36.622 --> 20:38.288
Narrator: Ain't that the truth?

20:38.290 --> 20:41.392
Instead of flipping to freedom,
the car barely quivered.

20:42.727 --> 20:46.029
Grant: Now, so far, we've re-created
the circumstances of the myth,

20:46.031 --> 20:48.399
and the results are not promising.

20:48.401 --> 20:51.935
Four rockets was enough
to get a person out of the car,

20:51.937 --> 20:54.738
but not enough to move the car at all.

20:54.740 --> 20:58.242
Narrator: Indeed, the math
of the myth just doesn't add up.

20:58.244 --> 21:00.477
800 pounds can propel a passenger,

21:00.479 --> 21:03.447
but it's never going to flip a car.

21:03.449 --> 21:05.115
But all is not lost.

21:05.117 --> 21:08.318
We want to give this myth
the best possible chance,

21:08.320 --> 21:10.821
so we're actually going to step it up.

21:12.524 --> 21:14.358
We're going to make our ejector seat

21:14.360 --> 21:17.461
an equivalent
to a fighter-jet ejector seat.

21:17.463 --> 21:20.531
Now we're talking about
4,000 pounds of thrust.

21:20.533 --> 21:22.666
I mean, it's a little bit of overkill,

21:22.668 --> 21:24.802
but Q might have gone there.

21:24.804 --> 21:26.637
Narrator: Their first ejector seat

21:26.639 --> 21:29.773
replicated the flimsy flame of the film,

21:29.775 --> 21:31.642
and it didn't pack enough punch.

21:31.644 --> 21:32.709
But this time...

21:32.711 --> 21:35.012
Whoo-hoo, look at all these rockets.

21:35.014 --> 21:36.580
It's like the 4th of July.

21:36.582 --> 21:38.282
Narrator: ...all bets are off

21:38.284 --> 21:41.251
as the MythBusters fire
this myth to the max.

21:41.253 --> 21:44.254
But will it be the shot
in the arm this test needs?

21:44.256 --> 21:45.889
Tory: The whole concept here

21:45.891 --> 21:49.159
is that the ejector seat
is firing down into the ground,

21:49.161 --> 21:52.229
therefore pushing the car over,
back onto its wheels.

21:52.231 --> 21:54.164
But I just have a hard time believing

21:54.166 --> 21:55.732
this Hollywood myth is true.

21:55.734 --> 21:57.601
What I think is gonna happen

21:57.603 --> 22:00.704
is this car is just gonna go up
into a big ball of fire.

22:00.706 --> 22:01.839
[ Siren wails ]

22:01.841 --> 22:03.340
Narrator: Well, in that case,

22:03.342 --> 22:06.977
it's a good job that
the fire department has arrived.

22:06.979 --> 22:08.312
Okay, this is Bond ejector seat,

22:08.314 --> 22:09.746
20 rockets, 4,000 pounds of thrust.

22:09.748 --> 22:11.248
Take it away.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.917
Tory: All right, let's see if
the ejector seat flips the car.

22:13.919 --> 22:17.921
Here we go in 3, 2, 1, fire.

22:17.923 --> 22:19.623
Wow!

22:19.625 --> 22:20.691
Whoa!

22:20.693 --> 22:22.559
Grant: Whoa!
[ Laughs ]

22:22.561 --> 22:25.696
It lifted it a little bit,
but it didn't flip it.

22:25.698 --> 22:27.498
That was sweet!

22:27.500 --> 22:28.665
Let's go see the carnage.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.734
Well, we should probably
get that fire put out.

22:30.736 --> 22:33.871
Narrator:
With the fire brought under control,

22:33.873 --> 22:36.106
the guys go in for a closer look,

22:36.108 --> 22:38.775
not that it's really necessary.

22:41.779 --> 22:43.447
Tory: So, this myth is busted.

22:43.449 --> 22:46.250
No matter what we did, we
could not get this car to flip

22:46.252 --> 22:48.051
with the rocket ejector seat.

22:49.787 --> 22:52.322
And that was at
a ridiculous amount of thrust.

22:52.324 --> 22:54.424
However, we are not gonna stop here.

22:54.426 --> 22:56.894
This is the part of the show
where we replicate the results,

22:56.896 --> 22:59.129
and we're gonna find out
how much thrust it would take

22:59.131 --> 23:00.797
to get this car to flip.

23:00.799 --> 23:03.100
We're gonna do it old-school,
Hollywood style.

23:03.102 --> 23:04.768
Narrator: Strap yourself in,

23:04.770 --> 23:07.738
because this myth's about to flip its lid.

23:07.740 --> 23:10.440
[ Cheering, laughter ]

23:10.442 --> 23:12.242
Next...

23:12.244 --> 23:15.546
This is the most dangerous thing
I have ever built.

23:15.548 --> 23:19.583
Narrator: And still to come, Adam
faces a 35-foot free-fall finale.

23:19.585 --> 23:20.951
I'm a little bit scared.

23:24.990 --> 23:27.025
Please, don't' try anything
you are about to see at home.

23:27.027 --> 23:29.327
We're what you call experts.

23:36.335 --> 23:38.903
Narrator: According to YouTube,
a 4-inch bubble burrito

23:38.905 --> 23:43.708
will mean you don't drop dead
from a 35-foot drop.

23:43.710 --> 23:44.609
Go!

23:44.611 --> 23:46.945
But according to the MythBusters,

23:46.947 --> 23:49.214
you most definitely will.

23:49.216 --> 23:50.748
Still totally and utterly dead, though.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.817
Yet all is not lost.

23:52.819 --> 23:55.053
The readings we've been getting
thus far in the shop are good.

23:55.055 --> 23:56.521
They give us a direction,

23:56.523 --> 23:59.891
but they're nowhere near
our butter zone of 10 G's.

23:59.893 --> 24:01.826
So, now Buster here
is our new human analogue.

24:01.828 --> 24:04.028
He's floppier, he's more accurate,

24:04.030 --> 24:07.131
and he's gonna get dropped from
the highest point in our shop.

24:07.133 --> 24:10.535
Narrator: 15 feet is more than double
the height of their bench tests

24:10.537 --> 24:13.471
but still less than half
the height of the myth.

24:13.473 --> 24:17.008
So, will Buster's impact
on a 16-inch bed of bubbles

24:17.010 --> 24:20.078
approach the 10 G-load
that this myth needs?

24:20.080 --> 24:25.116
Buster, dropping 15 feet into
16 inches of bubble packaging.

24:25.118 --> 24:28.353
3, 2, 1, go.

24:33.392 --> 24:35.126
- That was magnificent.
- Wasn't it?

24:35.128 --> 24:39.831
Buster bounced dead center,
but is his impact in the zone?

24:39.833 --> 24:42.400
So, Buster's fall into the
bubble packaging from 15 feet

24:42.402 --> 24:44.469
was perfect.

24:44.471 --> 24:47.272
But he pulled 39 G's upon impact.

24:47.274 --> 24:50.642
We're looking for a butter zone of 10 G's.

24:50.644 --> 24:52.744
39 is totally out, so next up,

24:52.746 --> 24:55.079
we're gonna double the thickness
and drop him again.

24:55.081 --> 24:59.050
Narrator: 39 is four times their
safety target, so once more,

24:59.052 --> 25:01.986
they double the bubbles
to 32 inches thick.

25:01.988 --> 25:03.721
It's starting to get kind of
impractical, isn't it?

25:03.723 --> 25:05.723
[ Laughing ] Yeah, it is. Here we go.

25:05.725 --> 25:08.693
Buster, dropping 15 feet into
32 inches of bubble material.

[ Laughs ]

25:17.470 --> 25:19.070
Poor Buster.

25:19.072 --> 25:21.372
Narrator: Once again, Buster bounces,

25:21.374 --> 25:23.141
but is he walking away?

25:23.143 --> 25:25.910
I would feel like if we were
gonna see a reduced G-load,

25:25.912 --> 25:28.179
that he would take longer
to bounce back up.

25:28.181 --> 25:30.281
It's not the result they were after.

25:30.283 --> 25:33.585
Doubling the bubbles reduced
the load by less than a quarter,

25:33.587 --> 25:35.320
and that doesn't bode well,

25:35.322 --> 25:39.157
because if 16 inches resulted in 39 G's,

25:39.159 --> 25:41.092
and 32 inches in 30,

25:41.094 --> 25:45.463
they'd need a pile of packing
15 feet high to get to 10 G's,

25:45.465 --> 25:48.232
and that's just for a 15-foot drop.

25:48.234 --> 25:52.403
From 35 feet, they'd need
well over 50 feet of wrap,

25:52.405 --> 25:55.340
giving Buster a 100-foot diameter.

25:55.342 --> 25:59.510
So, if layering up
the bubble pack isn't working,

25:59.512 --> 26:00.979
is there a design that will?

26:00.981 --> 26:02.113
[ Laughs ] Yeah.

26:02.115 --> 26:03.715
For a full 60 minutes,

26:03.717 --> 26:06.718
the guys stop, drop, and roll out ideas...

26:06.720 --> 26:08.653
What about something like this?

26:08.655 --> 26:09.887
...but get nowhere fast.

26:09.889 --> 26:11.923
That doesn't seem to give any improvement.

26:11.925 --> 26:14.959
But then they pop out a plan in parallel.

26:14.961 --> 26:17.295
What if we didn't wrap it in tight tubes,

26:17.297 --> 26:21.199
but we wrap it in tubes with
a bigger hole in the middle?

26:21.201 --> 26:24.636
So, these would crush just like
a coil spring in a mattress.

26:24.638 --> 26:26.104
Right. Exactly.

26:26.106 --> 26:29.240
It may not look like much, but
by alternating regular sheets

26:29.242 --> 26:31.442
with coiled but hollow bubble springs,

26:31.444 --> 26:33.311
the guys have high hopes.

26:33.313 --> 26:34.946
- Awesome.
- All right.

26:34.948 --> 26:37.749
And once two bubble-spring
mattresses are complete,

26:37.751 --> 26:40.618
Buster's ready
to take another for the team.

26:40.620 --> 26:41.853
Here we go.

26:41.855 --> 26:45.156
Buster onto modified
bubble-packaging geometry

26:45.158 --> 26:47.859
in 3, 2, 1.

26:50.029 --> 26:53.297
With no Buster bounce,
there's a clear difference.

26:54.967 --> 26:57.769
Oh, my God, that's, like,
one of the best drops ever.

26:57.771 --> 27:00.338
Once he enters the bed,
you never see him again.

27:00.340 --> 27:04.709
But from 15 feet,
Buster still took 30 G's,

27:04.711 --> 27:06.277
three times their 10-G target.

27:06.279 --> 27:09.080
So, they add one more mattress.

27:09.082 --> 27:11.349
In 3, 2, 1.

27:13.519 --> 27:16.120
But is this the soft landing
they're looking for?

27:18.090 --> 27:20.291
So, our 15-foot Buster drops
here in the shop

27:20.293 --> 27:22.226
are yielding some exciting data fruit,

27:22.228 --> 27:23.695
and I just coined that term.

27:23.697 --> 27:25.263
Check out the first drop here.

27:25.265 --> 27:28.132
We are dropping Buster
into two layers of tubes,

27:28.134 --> 27:30.501
constructed of thick-wall, heavy-back,

27:30.503 --> 27:32.103
half-inch bubble packaging,

27:32.105 --> 27:35.506
and he pulled an average
of 30 G's on that drop.

27:35.508 --> 27:37.642
That's an improvement over some
of the other stuff we've seen,

27:37.644 --> 27:39.010
but it's still not in our ballpark.

27:39.012 --> 27:41.512
However, for the second drop,
which you can see here,

27:41.514 --> 27:45.249
we added a layer of thin-wall,
non-heavy-duty,

27:45.251 --> 27:46.884
half-inch bubble packaging

27:46.886 --> 27:48.753
to slow down his deceleration,

27:48.755 --> 27:51.189
and it seems to have done exactly that.

27:51.191 --> 27:55.026
On that second drop,
he pulled an average of 15 G's.

27:55.028 --> 27:57.729
We cut our G-load in half.

27:57.731 --> 28:00.932
Narrator:
And to bring the 10-G target into range,

28:00.934 --> 28:04.702
Jamie's tweaking the tubes into
a more shock-absorbing shape.

28:04.704 --> 28:07.672
That cone, or funnel shape,

28:07.674 --> 28:11.676
will allow the bubbles to neatly
fold inside the structure,

28:11.678 --> 28:12.810
like so,

28:12.812 --> 28:15.513
and give us a nice, linear deceleration.

28:15.515 --> 28:18.516
Narrator: And these bubble cones
serve a double purpose.

28:18.518 --> 28:21.319
We can make a curved
instead of a flat sheet,

28:21.321 --> 28:23.988
and we can actually
roll Adam up inside it.

28:23.990 --> 28:26.257
Narrator: Uh, yep. You heard that right.

28:26.259 --> 28:28.993
And we can actually
roll Adam up inside it.

28:28.995 --> 28:32.196
Narrator: So confident are they
in their new mattress model

28:32.198 --> 28:34.665
that for the next drop,
it's out with Buster

28:34.667 --> 28:37.802
and in with someone
altogether more important.

28:37.804 --> 28:41.105
Now the question is, is this
engineering of bubble packaging

28:41.107 --> 28:43.141
enough to save my life?

28:43.143 --> 28:44.942
That's what we're doing next.

28:47.980 --> 28:49.280
All right.

28:49.282 --> 28:51.349
I hate to admit it,
but this Bond myth is busted.

28:51.351 --> 28:53.951
Yep. We got the car to bounce
up, but it didn't flip over.

28:53.953 --> 28:56.988
Plus, we burned up Bond in the process.

28:56.990 --> 28:58.156
So, that means...

28:58.158 --> 29:00.491
- It's time to replicate the results.
- Yep.

29:00.493 --> 29:04.061
There is one technique that Hollywood
uses when they want to flip a car.

29:04.063 --> 29:06.397
That's right... nitrogen cannon
pointed straight down

29:06.399 --> 29:07.899
should provide enough force

29:07.901 --> 29:10.001
to flip the car all the way back over.

29:10.003 --> 29:11.369
Nitrogen cannon it is.

29:11.371 --> 29:16.107
Narrator: Originally built
for the superhero special...

29:16.109 --> 29:18.743
the nitrogen cannon sure packs a punch.

29:18.745 --> 29:20.077
Ooh!

29:20.079 --> 29:24.215
But for this myth,
the gloves are coming off.

the cannon's power to the max.

29:41.134 --> 29:45.069
And in theory, this
mighty machine should be able

29:45.071 --> 29:47.471
to flip this myth on its head.

29:47.473 --> 29:48.940
It fits!

29:48.942 --> 29:50.074
Whew.

29:50.076 --> 29:52.443
Narrator: But what about in practice?

29:52.445 --> 29:55.213
Kari:
We're back at the New Jerusalem runway.

29:55.215 --> 29:57.081
Now, we've already busted our Bond myth

29:57.083 --> 29:58.816
that an ejector seat's gonna be able

29:58.818 --> 30:01.018
to flip a car from upside down
to right-side up,

30:01.020 --> 30:03.855
so now we're gonna get
a little Hollywood on it.

30:03.857 --> 30:07.124
We've got a nitrogen cannon
loaded in the passenger seat.

30:07.126 --> 30:09.093
Hopefully, this is actually
going to flip our car

30:09.095 --> 30:12.597
completely over so we can see
this Bond myth in action.

30:12.599 --> 30:15.032
Narrator: But before firing it up,

30:15.034 --> 30:17.468
first comes the obligatory inversion.

30:17.470 --> 30:19.337
Kari: Okay, so, just to be clear,

30:19.339 --> 30:20.872
here's how things are going to work.

30:20.874 --> 30:22.073
Hang on one sec.

30:22.075 --> 30:24.108
Inside the barrel of the cannon

30:24.110 --> 30:26.611
is a solid steel rod
that's about 3 feet long.

30:26.613 --> 30:28.212
Yeah, hold it right there.

30:28.214 --> 30:29.547
When the car's in position,

30:29.549 --> 30:32.283
Grant's going to weld
the bracket from the rod

30:32.285 --> 30:34.952
onto the trench plate
so it doesn't fly out.

30:34.954 --> 30:36.687
Then we'll fill the tank
to maximum pressure,

30:36.689 --> 30:39.090
and the idea that when we trigger it...

30:39.092 --> 30:40.124

30:40.126 --> 30:41.492
[ Metal clangs ]

into the ground with such power

that the car should twist up
and over, landing on its wheels.

30:47.767 --> 30:49.133
Narrator: Indeed,

30:49.135 --> 30:52.236
but it's not just the tank
that's feeling the pressure.

30:52.238 --> 30:54.972
Grant: Well, is this orders of magnitude

more dangerous than what we normally do?

30:58.611 --> 31:01.512
Look, I'm a little nervous, all right?

31:01.514 --> 31:06.517
The cannon could rupture,
and the valve could have a leak.

31:06.519 --> 31:10.955

37:58.979 --> 38:03.515
You keep track of Adam.
Make sure he's okay.

38:03.517 --> 38:07.786
Luckily for everyone, it's not
long before the wind falls.

38:07.788 --> 38:09.221
Okay.

38:09.223 --> 38:12.457
Is there anybody that's not good to go?

38:12.459 --> 38:14.559
So, it's now or never.

38:14.561 --> 38:20.198
Okay, we're going in 3, 2, 1.

38:25.705 --> 38:27.472
There's no doubt about it.

38:27.474 --> 38:29.541
The padded pod plummeted.

38:29.543 --> 38:31.510
But how's the cargo?

38:32.912 --> 38:34.579
That silence rings alarm bells.

38:34.581 --> 38:39.518
The team rushes in, and Jamie is
the first to the scene, when...

38:39.520 --> 38:42.120
Oh, I'm okay!

38:42.122 --> 38:43.789
[ Grunts ]

38:43.791 --> 38:45.357
I'm okay.

38:45.359 --> 38:48.260
after a free fall of 15 feet...

38:48.262 --> 38:49.661
Wow.

38:49.663 --> 38:52.464
...it looks like Adam
and Jamie's bubble engineering

38:52.466 --> 38:54.132
has taken the bulk of the blow.

38:54.134 --> 38:55.434
That was intense.

38:55.436 --> 38:58.470
But the touchdown didn't please the pilot.

38:58.472 --> 38:59.771
What happened was
the moment you released me,

38:59.773 --> 39:01.373
my head came off the board,

39:01.375 --> 39:03.709
and then, an instant later,
it hit the board.

39:03.711 --> 39:07.379
But that rough landing
wasn't the worst part.

39:07.381 --> 39:09.614
Ohh, I have to tell you, man,

39:09.616 --> 39:12.150
the weight of all this bubble wrap

39:12.152 --> 39:13.919
was the hardest part of that.

39:13.921 --> 39:15.854
It felt like two guys sitting on my chest.

39:15.856 --> 39:18.156
Well, that's something
Buster couldn't tell us, huh?

39:18.158 --> 39:21.760
It's absolutely what I call
an empirical test.

39:23.396 --> 39:25.030
Thank you, sir.

39:25.032 --> 39:26.565
[ Both laugh ]

39:26.567 --> 39:28.500
It's done!

39:28.502 --> 39:29.768
Whoo!

39:29.770 --> 39:32.037
While it came close to crushing him,

39:32.039 --> 39:34.573
their bubble barrel
did protect the plummet,

39:34.575 --> 39:36.608
peaking at just 9 G's,

39:36.610 --> 39:41.646
but remember, in the clip,
bubble boy jumped from 35 feet.

39:43.049 --> 39:44.616
Yeah, but you know what?

39:44.618 --> 39:48.053
I don't think I'd trust
something like this at 35 feet.

39:48.055 --> 39:49.654
I don't want to go at 35 feet.

39:49.656 --> 39:51.990
If I went at 35 feet,
I would need more padding,

39:51.992 --> 39:53.892
and more padding, I couldn't take it.

39:53.894 --> 39:56.762
I think that's the limit
of human experimentation.

39:57.897 --> 39:59.798
It just makes me nervous anyway.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.566
[ Chuckling ] You and me both.

40:01.568 --> 40:03.835
So, Buster's going to pick up the pieces

40:03.837 --> 40:07.839
and wrap this myth
for the final 35-foot fall.

40:07.841 --> 40:10.342
He will have around him
the same amount of padding I had

40:10.344 --> 40:12.110
at 15 feet, and here is why.

40:12.112 --> 40:15.547
With all the weight of
that bubble packaging around me,

40:15.549 --> 40:17.582
it was about as much
as my body could take.

40:17.584 --> 40:20.218
That tells me that this is the
most amount of bubble packaging

40:20.220 --> 40:23.088
one could have around their body
for a jump off of a building.

40:23.090 --> 40:24.823
That further tells me

40:24.825 --> 40:27.225
that if Buster does not survive
in this amount of padding,

40:27.227 --> 40:30.362
the entire idea of jumping off a building

40:30.364 --> 40:33.732
and being protected by bubble
packaging is totally busted.

40:33.734 --> 40:37.536
Narrator: With old friend David Harding
ready to crunch their drop data,

40:37.538 --> 40:41.339
their package is postmarked
35 feet, ready for delivery.

40:41.341 --> 40:42.808
All right, here we go.

40:42.810 --> 40:47.746
Buster, from the full 35 feet in 3, 2, 1.

40:50.049 --> 40:51.049
[ Laughs ]

40:51.051 --> 40:52.350
That was perfect.

40:52.352 --> 40:54.119
I think that was perfect.

40:54.121 --> 40:55.720
The falling was perfect.

40:55.722 --> 40:59.157
The landing, not so much.

40:59.159 --> 41:01.593
So glad that was not me.

41:01.595 --> 41:03.261
Narrator: But how did Buster fare?

41:03.263 --> 41:08.066
Well, for that, it's over
to David, the data doctor.

41:08.068 --> 41:09.534
All right, David.

41:09.536 --> 41:12.404
I'm dying to find out
how Buster did from 35 feet.

41:12.406 --> 41:13.939
What do the numbers say?

41:13.941 --> 41:17.242
Harding: All right, the torso
peaked right around 29 G's.

41:17.244 --> 41:18.210
Ow!

41:18.212 --> 41:19.644
Jamie: Yeah.

41:19.646 --> 41:23.381
The head was quite a bit higher.
You can see it's about 48 G's.

41:23.383 --> 41:24.649
48 G's?

41:24.651 --> 41:25.984
That would hurt.

41:25.986 --> 41:28.787
Dude, that is barely survivable,

41:28.789 --> 41:31.089
but you'd be tuggin' funny
for the rest of your life.

41:31.091 --> 41:32.858
Yeah. That's quite a hit.

41:32.860 --> 41:36.361
I am so glad that I did not try this one.

41:36.363 --> 41:39.164
Yep, although Adam and Jamie's
mattress mechanism

41:39.166 --> 41:42.300
offered way more protection
than the bubble-boy burrito,

41:42.302 --> 41:46.938
this three-story story
is nothing but busted.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.174
So, how are we gonna call it?

41:50.176 --> 41:51.142
I think it's pretty clear.

41:51.144 --> 41:53.311
We've tested it every way from Sunday.

41:53.313 --> 41:56.313
There is no reasonable amount
of bubble packaging

41:56.338 --> 41:59.638
that will allow you to safely leap
off a three and a half story building.

41:59.663 --> 42:02.663
The myth is busted, and
the whole idea is busted.

42:02.688 --> 42:04.388
Yeap. I agree. It's busted.

42:04.413 --> 42:05.613
Let's get out of here.
