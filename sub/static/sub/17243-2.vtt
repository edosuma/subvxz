00:20.388 --> 00:22.389
- Moira! Moira!
- Hm.

00:22.424 --> 00:24.425
Oh no!

00:24.459 --> 00:26.660
I just finally cried myself to sleep.

00:26.695 --> 00:28.329
The bed is soaking wet.

00:28.363 --> 00:30.163
Is it blood?

00:30.198 --> 00:32.064
No! There's... there
is leak in the ceiling.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.167
There is a brown disgusting drip coming.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.802
Owwww!

00:35.837 --> 00:38.171
Look it! Look... oh my God.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.207
- I can't do it.
- This place is a dump! It's a dump

00:40.242 --> 00:41.041
- I tried!
- You know what it's a hell hole.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.477
I tired, John, but I can't!

00:43.711 --> 00:45.045
Wake up.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.449
Start packing, the pluming
is shot to hell in this place

00:49.483 --> 00:51.918
and we are getting out. We are getting out!

00:51.953 --> 00:53.719
What are you wearing?
What is that? A nightgown?

00:53.754 --> 00:55.788
It's a nightshirt, David.
And that's not the issue.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.091
The issue is the brown sludge in my bed.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.525
We're selling the place!

00:59.560 --> 01:01.360
It's 6:00 am!

01:01.394 --> 01:03.729
What's the name of that
mouthy kid at the front desk?

01:03.764 --> 01:05.565
I don't know. I'm trying very hard
not to connect with people right now.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.700
The mouth the mouth, the girl.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.569
You might want to rethink
the nightgown first.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.637
There's an ebenezer scrooge
thing happening right now.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.639
Oh my God, that's who I was thinking of.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.274
You know what?! I'll do it myself.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.076
My best to Bob Cratchit.

01:31.657 --> 01:34.125
Hello! Hello! Service?

01:36.629 --> 01:38.329
This bell is broken.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.565
Yeah, sorry.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.067
It's more or less decorative.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.937
There's a leak in my room.

01:45.972 --> 01:49.975
Brown, disgusting sewage water was
dripping all over my bed this morning.

01:50.009 --> 01:53.544
I was soaking wet. So I need a plumber.

01:53.578 --> 01:57.281
You want me to call a plumber?

01:57.316 --> 01:58.249
Do I want you to call a plumber?

01:58.283 --> 02:00.618
Yes, yes I do. I want you call...

02:00.652 --> 02:01.719
You should already be on the phone.

02:01.753 --> 02:03.421
Could you call a plumber?

02:03.455 --> 02:07.825
Stevie let's see if he's
home... or conscious.

02:07.859 --> 02:09.727
He's a good guy, he's just a big drinker.

02:09.761 --> 02:11.629
I also need a real estate agent.

02:11.663 --> 02:14.565
The name of a good real
estate agent right away.

02:14.599 --> 02:17.267
Ooh, there's a guy named Ray.

02:20.005 --> 02:23.540
Yeah. He's the best one.
He's also the only one so...

02:23.574 --> 02:25.842
A guy named Ray...

02:28.329 --> 02:30.297
Is there anything else I
can help you with, Mr. Rose?

02:30.331 --> 02:32.465
Yes. My wife and I will be taking breakfast

02:32.500 --> 02:34.067
in our room this morning.

02:34.102 --> 02:37.771
Eggs florentine and a yoghurt parfait.

02:37.805 --> 02:39.672
Yeah... unfortunately, due
to a lack of everything,

02:39.707 --> 02:41.974
we don't do room service.

02:42.009 --> 02:43.476
Uh, but you're always
welcome to help yourself

02:43.511 --> 02:48.247
to our complimentary espresso bar.

02:48.282 --> 02:49.682
I'd rather drink the pipe-water.

02:49.717 --> 02:52.018
I hear ya.

02:52.052 --> 02:56.688
Ew! Who even is this girl?

02:56.723 --> 02:58.357
He said he'd never date someone
with a toe ring and yet...

03:02.462 --> 03:05.064
- Rub my back.
- What?! No.

03:05.098 --> 03:07.333
I rubbed your back many a
nights when you were little.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.668
Yeah, in exchange for half my allowance.

03:09.702 --> 03:13.305
Fine. You may select one silver
piece from my accessory case.

03:13.339 --> 03:14.940
- Right here.
- Omigod...

03:15.274 --> 03:17.509
she has hakuna matata tattooed on her foot.

03:17.544 --> 03:20.178
Stavros was seeing escorts before you.

03:20.212 --> 03:22.448
A Disney tattoo shouldn't be a surprise.

03:22.482 --> 03:24.282
We said no social media post
breakup. We had a pact about that.

03:24.316 --> 03:26.052
He dates hooker.

03:26.086 --> 03:29.988
Oh, well, I'm sorry, I don't
hire my friends at model castings.

03:30.023 --> 03:31.923
Actually, now that I think about
in, where are those friends?

03:31.958 --> 03:33.491
They're just giving me space right now.

03:33.526 --> 03:35.060
Because they're considered people.

03:35.094 --> 03:36.662
Oh right. Space. Yeah.

03:36.696 --> 03:37.863
Okay. Well, I think it's
bests that he dumped you.

03:37.897 --> 03:40.065
He didn't dump me.

03:40.099 --> 03:43.735
We actually both decided that it was
best that he see other people so...

03:43.770 --> 03:47.405
Children, mindless bickering is
a luxury we may no longer afford.

03:47.439 --> 03:51.609
You are blind to reality
and for that I am most proud

03:51.644 --> 03:53.944
but our worlds evil twin...
has reared her ugly...

03:53.979 --> 03:55.513
Okay. I'm taking my
journal into the bathroom.

03:55.548 --> 03:57.748
Where I will be shutting the door.

03:57.783 --> 03:59.850
David! You might actually wanna hear this.

04:04.923 --> 04:06.791
Oh hi!

04:06.825 --> 04:08.258
Are you Ray?

04:08.293 --> 04:09.626
- Yes.
- You're late.

04:09.661 --> 04:11.595
Johnny Rrose. My wife, Moira.

04:11.629 --> 04:13.397
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:13.431 --> 04:16.266
Oh, I love your complexion.

04:16.301 --> 04:19.503
So... what can I help you with,

04:19.536 --> 04:22.806
housing, investment opportunities?

04:22.840 --> 04:24.374
Mr. Rose and I would like
to put a for sale sign

04:24.409 --> 04:26.943
on this incredible town.

04:26.977 --> 04:28.612
We're willing to settle
for what we paid for it.

04:28.646 --> 04:31.981
More if you can get it,
but definitely not less.

04:32.016 --> 04:35.685
Well, I'm not gonna lie to
you I'm not super optimistic.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.287
You know, because the government
saw no value in Schitt's Creek.

04:38.322 --> 04:40.489
You know, when they
repossessed your assets.

04:40.524 --> 04:41.858
You know, because of the humiliating...

04:41.892 --> 04:43.359
Yes, we know. We know. We know.

04:43.393 --> 04:45.929
Well, we'll do our best.

04:45.963 --> 04:47.663
First we just have to get
Roland to sign off on the listing

04:47.698 --> 04:51.267
and then we're good to go.

04:51.301 --> 04:55.338
I need to confer with the
financial powerhouse of the family.

04:55.372 --> 04:59.375
Since when did the mayor
need to sign off on this?

04:59.409 --> 05:02.111
Ray, since when did the mayor
need to sign off on this?

05:02.145 --> 05:03.946
Well, it's all here...

05:10.019 --> 05:11.854
Son of a bitch!

05:16.425 --> 05:17.993
Oh, excuse me.

05:18.027 --> 05:18.894
I don't think my sheets have been cleaned.

05:18.928 --> 05:21.029
They smell like cigarettes.

05:21.064 --> 05:22.530
No, that's just the way they smell.

05:22.565 --> 05:24.932
Also, you can tell your dad
that the plumber was busy

05:24.967 --> 05:26.768
so I just pushed the bed against the wall

05:26.802 --> 05:29.036
and put down a bucket where the bed was.

05:29.071 --> 05:30.472
Okay. We're gonna be selling the town,

05:30.506 --> 05:32.274
so it'll be someone else's problem soon.

05:32.308 --> 05:35.477
But it's such a great place to live.

05:35.511 --> 05:36.711
I think you're funny.

05:36.746 --> 05:39.681
Thank you.

05:39.715 --> 05:43.117
Um, look I know this
probably isn't your thing,

05:43.152 --> 05:46.620
but there's a tailgate party later.

05:46.655 --> 05:49.390
It's not exactly clubbing
but you know... close.

05:49.424 --> 05:50.724
I don't even know what 'tailgate' means.

05:50.759 --> 05:53.560
In my mind I'm picturing like a Klan rally.

05:53.595 --> 05:56.130
Yeah, just fewer pointy hats.

05:56.165 --> 05:59.700
It's just townies with un-ironic haircuts.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.435
Okay. I'm gonna pass I'm
not really in the mood

06:01.469 --> 06:02.436
to be a victim of a
hate crime tonight so...

06:02.470 --> 06:05.038
Okay.

06:05.072 --> 06:07.173
Stavros just posted three more photos.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.243
Who are these jenky women?

06:09.377 --> 06:11.445
Uh, from the looks of it they're
blonde and mostly naked so...

06:13.515 --> 06:15.048
Is there a bar in this place

06:15.082 --> 06:17.851
or are we in one of
those religo cult towns?

06:17.885 --> 06:19.085
I was just telling your
brother about a party tonight.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.554
But he passed so...

06:21.588 --> 06:24.757
Um, yes. Love that journey for me.

06:24.792 --> 06:27.861
Okay, so I'm looking
for a guy like a mechanic

06:27.895 --> 06:30.630
or someone that hammers stuff.

06:30.664 --> 06:34.667
Um, at least 5'7. Kind of like full lips.

06:34.702 --> 06:37.870
Athletic body. Maybe a
neck tattoo would be cute.

06:37.904 --> 06:40.506
No, it wouldn't.

06:40.541 --> 06:42.608
You know, I think this
could be really good for me.

06:42.643 --> 06:45.478
So thank you.

06:45.512 --> 06:48.680
You're welcome. Yeah.
I'm looking forward to it.

06:48.715 --> 06:51.317
Having all that fun.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.186
Wow.

06:59.226 --> 07:02.461
So Johnny Rose wants the
ol' Johnny Hancock, huh?

07:02.495 --> 07:03.862
Well...

07:03.896 --> 07:05.129
Shouldn't be a problem, Johnny.

07:05.164 --> 07:07.566
I'm happy to signoff on the listing.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.601
Well, thank you, very much,
Rolland, I appreciated.

07:09.635 --> 07:11.603
Sure. Why don't you come
over tonight and pick it up.

07:11.637 --> 07:13.739
Mr. Mayor, that's not necessary.

07:13.773 --> 07:16.207
No, no. Roland, a
signature, that's all I need.

07:16.242 --> 07:17.676
Johnny look, here is what you're gonna do;

07:17.710 --> 07:19.878
you're gonna grab the kids,
you're gonna grab Moira,

07:19.912 --> 07:21.645
you're gonna come over we're gonna
sit down like civilized people,

07:21.680 --> 07:24.048
have a few laughs,

07:24.083 --> 07:26.584
and then at the end of the evening
we'll get to the big signing, okay?

07:26.618 --> 07:29.287
Right. Okay. Honestly Roland, it's just a,

07:29.321 --> 07:31.689
it's just a signature. A
flick of the wrist. That's it.

07:31.723 --> 07:33.892
You're not rejecting my
hospitality, are you, Johnny?

07:33.926 --> 07:35.593
Because that really wouldn't be a good way

07:35.627 --> 07:38.028
to start things off, I don't think.

07:38.062 --> 07:41.866
No, no. I'd love to come to
dinner are you kidding me?

07:41.900 --> 07:43.534
No. I just thought,
let's do business first,

07:43.568 --> 07:45.770
get the signature, and then dinner.

07:45.804 --> 07:49.273
Johnny, you want that,
to get that you need this.

07:49.307 --> 07:51.509
So let's just do this my way.

07:51.543 --> 07:54.111
Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, dinner is.

07:54.145 --> 07:56.813
Dinner it is, atta boy. Okay.

08:00.584 --> 08:03.220
How did you not get the
contract signed, John?

08:03.254 --> 08:07.457
Can one thing, just one thing,
not be easy in this town?!

08:07.491 --> 08:09.759
Look Roland's playing games,
honey, he's playing games.

08:09.794 --> 08:12.261
So this is something we have to do.

08:12.296 --> 08:14.196
Okay. Well, I would love to go,

08:14.231 --> 08:16.299
but I've actually double booked myself.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.769
I'm going to a truck party
um, with the front desk girl

08:19.804 --> 08:22.004
and obviously she'd be super devastated

08:22.039 --> 08:23.907
if I bailed last minute. So I can't.

08:23.941 --> 08:26.542
I can't go.

08:26.576 --> 08:27.944
Okay. Well, cancel it because
you're coming to dinner.

08:27.978 --> 08:29.645
No.

08:29.679 --> 08:31.347
One of you kids has to come.

08:31.381 --> 08:32.881
Davis, you've got nothing on tonight.

08:32.916 --> 08:34.150
How... how do you know that.

08:34.183 --> 08:36.152
What do you have on tonight?

08:36.186 --> 08:37.820
- What?
- Good, it's settled.

08:37.854 --> 08:39.655
Or you could go alone, John.

08:39.688 --> 08:42.524
Since you are the one who did
not get the contract signed.

08:42.558 --> 08:46.628
Moira, Roland wants the
family there tonight,

08:46.663 --> 08:48.931
so my family has to go tonight.

08:48.965 --> 08:50.732
Let me explain something about business.

08:50.767 --> 08:53.268
- Don't you dare...
- It's a dance.

08:53.302 --> 08:56.271
And sometimes you lead.
and sometimes you follow.

08:56.305 --> 08:57.573
And which are you doing now, John?

08:57.607 --> 09:00.408
I am leading, Moira.

09:00.443 --> 09:02.910
In a Roland game I think you're following.

09:02.990 --> 09:06.226
Following in the game but
leading in the dance, right?

09:09.297 --> 09:11.364
And he thinks he's leading in the dance,

09:11.398 --> 09:15.901
but only because I've
allowed him to think...

09:15.936 --> 09:17.704
- Are you listening to this?
- Hmm?

09:17.738 --> 09:19.905
It doesn't matter. I'm leading.

09:19.940 --> 09:22.441
I'll shall bathe.

09:22.475 --> 09:26.345
And if I bang my head and
slip beneath the surface,

09:26.379 --> 09:28.214
so be it, Mr. Rose.

09:31.218 --> 09:33.152
- What's this?
- Uh yeah, Stevie called.

09:33.186 --> 09:36.288
Apparently the plumber's in rehab.

09:36.323 --> 09:39.958
And you also... you
have something on your...

09:39.992 --> 09:41.894
I don't know what that is but it's a thing.

09:42.029 --> 09:45.229
David, for the gate party tonight is
it more of a leather pants thing or...

09:45.263 --> 09:46.430
Son of a bitch!

09:49.623 --> 09:51.375
Thanks for having us, Jocelyn. Thank you.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.782
Make yourselves at home.
Roland is just on the toilet.

09:54.816 --> 09:56.851
Oh, what a surprise.

09:56.955 --> 10:02.026
You have a really lovely home.
It's really um, understated.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.263
Thank you. I get a lot of
my ideas from magazines.

10:05.297 --> 10:07.064
Don't be modest.

10:07.099 --> 10:10.567
This is 100 percent you and only you.

10:10.602 --> 10:13.871
Roland hey, okay. It's the Roses.

10:15.930 --> 10:18.031
Come on, folk, please sit.

10:18.065 --> 10:21.201
Come on, I'm just the
mayor for crying out loud.

10:21.235 --> 10:24.004
Ooh, hors d'oeuvres. Mmm.

10:24.038 --> 10:26.640
That's too bad about Alexis.

10:26.674 --> 10:29.409
Well, it is. But we did
bring the life of the party.

10:29.443 --> 10:31.911
Our David.

10:31.945 --> 10:34.647
Well, I guess, that just means there
is more for you and me, right Dave?

10:34.681 --> 10:37.283
I hope everyone likes a cheeseball.

10:37.318 --> 10:40.220
Cheeseball?

10:40.254 --> 10:42.222
It's the treat that keeps
our love life percolating.

10:42.256 --> 10:44.057
It's like an aphrodisiac with him.

10:44.091 --> 10:45.992
Go ahead.

10:46.026 --> 10:49.729
Oh yes, can't wait. Can't wait. Mmm.

10:49.763 --> 10:54.667
So David, tell us about yourself
I hear you're a gallerist.

10:54.701 --> 10:57.036
Wow. There's a $10 dollar word.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.437
David owned a brilliant gallery.

10:58.471 --> 11:00.072
Tell them about your last show.

11:00.106 --> 11:01.640
- It's not...
- You must, please.

11:01.974 --> 11:03.875
Tell them, David, tell them.

11:03.909 --> 11:06.210
The gallery worked with Janet Kempfluugen.

11:06.245 --> 11:08.580
Kempfluugen?

11:08.815 --> 11:11.282
She's a Brooklyn based performance
artist she's a big deal.

11:11.317 --> 11:13.852
Anyway um... she would walk into the space

11:13.886 --> 11:17.356
wearing a clay mask of a fawn,

11:17.390 --> 11:21.860
remove her clothing and breast
feed members of the audience.

11:21.894 --> 11:24.262
It was a commentary on income inequality.

11:27.299 --> 11:28.900
Wow...

11:28.934 --> 11:30.468
Heady stuff.

11:30.502 --> 11:32.070
Well, hmm...

11:34.139 --> 11:35.205
Lipgloss?

11:35.240 --> 11:37.808
No thank you.

11:37.843 --> 11:39.276
I wish I could pull off the
whole gloomy, no makeup look.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.612
It's so French.

11:41.646 --> 11:42.813
Thank you.

11:42.848 --> 11:44.348
So, why are you single?

11:44.383 --> 11:46.316
Who said I'm single?

11:46.351 --> 11:48.218
Girl, we're on the hunt.
I hope you're single.

11:48.253 --> 11:50.654
Oh, no. I'm not "on the hunt".

11:50.689 --> 11:52.555
A town this size, you've
either been through 'em

11:52.590 --> 11:53.924
or know a little too much about 'em.

11:53.958 --> 11:55.692
Hmm. Okay. I'm gonna go do a lap

11:55.726 --> 11:58.061
and this swan is best when she flies solo.

11:58.096 --> 12:00.730
- So you're gonna be okay?
- I live here.

12:00.765 --> 12:02.565
Okay. Am I good?

12:02.600 --> 12:06.069
Yes? Okay. Thank Are you not cold-

12:06.104 --> 12:07.137
Chuck, beer!

12:12.410 --> 12:14.143
I know it's gotta be in here somewhere,

12:14.177 --> 12:16.345
slippery little bastard.

12:16.380 --> 12:19.115
Maybe a fork would help, Roland?

12:19.149 --> 12:22.952
Oh, that's sweet. Thank
you. I'm okay. I'll find it.

12:22.986 --> 12:25.854
So is that the ah, contract over there?

12:25.889 --> 12:28.590
Yeah, it is. You know, I
gotta be honest with you,

12:28.625 --> 12:31.693
I tried reading that
thing it is really boring.

12:31.728 --> 12:33.429
Ah, got it! There she is! Okay.

12:37.935 --> 12:39.668
Ohh! Oh my God, honey... oh, that is good.

12:41.671 --> 12:43.639
That is good.

12:43.673 --> 12:46.642
I believe you were saying, John.

12:46.676 --> 12:49.945
Yes. This reminds me of a
merger I put together in Zurich.

12:49.979 --> 12:52.180
It was two families
breaking bread together.

12:52.214 --> 12:55.317
Ahh! Agh. My head. My head hurts.

12:55.351 --> 12:57.485
Oh no! Are you okay?

12:57.519 --> 13:00.021
Um, it think it's the
migraines that I get a lot.

13:00.056 --> 13:02.824
Oh, I think... I think that'll pass, David.

13:02.858 --> 13:04.892
I don't think it's gonna pass.
I don't think it's passing.

13:04.927 --> 13:07.362
Migraines can be so awful.

13:07.396 --> 13:09.164
Yeah, well, not this one. Not this one.

13:09.198 --> 13:12.000
Yeah, you know what?
I... I think I need to go.

13:12.034 --> 13:14.234
I think you need to eat
something and that will help.

13:14.269 --> 13:16.370
No, I think I need to go back.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.972
Take me with you please.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.306
David, sit down. Sit down. Sit back down.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.341
Jocelyn, thank you so much for dinner.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.176
Why don't you lay down on our mattress.

13:22.210 --> 13:24.345
The sheets are in the dryer
but there is rubber pad.

13:24.379 --> 13:27.348
- No. Thanks.
- David! Don't go near the door.

13:27.382 --> 13:28.583
David! Do not open that door.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.423
I brought vodka as a house gift.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.758
I don't see it.

13:53.307 --> 13:55.675
That's what I say.  Great.

14:02.316 --> 14:07.249
- I'm Twyla from the cafe.
- Yeah.

14:07.321 --> 14:09.922
Yeah. Davis Rose.

14:09.956 --> 14:12.358
I'm a little drunk.

14:12.393 --> 14:16.062
- Hey.
- Hey Stevie.

14:16.096 --> 14:19.298
I am going to roast myself a marshmallow.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.567
- Anybody?
- No. Thanks.

14:21.601 --> 14:22.701
- You're all good?
- No.

14:22.736 --> 14:26.505
Great.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.206
I don't know why you were
so reluctant to show up here.

14:28.241 --> 14:31.209
You fit right in.

14:31.244 --> 14:32.945
Well, my sister texted me "help".

14:32.979 --> 14:34.346
And my mind went straight to deliverance.

14:34.380 --> 14:37.149
So I wasn't too far off.

14:37.183 --> 14:38.983
That's funny because your sister
texted me from across the bonfire

14:39.018 --> 14:41.119
and said you'd probably show up here

14:41.154 --> 14:42.754
because you were bored and lonely

14:42.788 --> 14:45.057
and had nothing better to do.

14:45.091 --> 14:46.658
Well, my sister is a broken
shell of a human being.

14:46.692 --> 14:47.892
That's where that's coming from so...

14:47.927 --> 14:50.529
Oh, okay.

14:50.563 --> 14:53.631
Oh. Well, she seems fine.

14:53.666 --> 14:56.734
Are you serious? That's
so funny. That's so funny.

14:56.769 --> 14:59.103
So I guess you're free to go.

15:04.843 --> 15:08.145
I'm gonna need a stiff drink
to get through this. Stiff.

15:14.018 --> 15:18.355
So Jocelyn, you were saying
that you teach high school,

15:18.390 --> 15:20.357
or you want to finish high school?

15:20.392 --> 15:23.427
I'm not sure, I couldn't hear
over your husband's chewing.

15:23.462 --> 15:25.262
I teach high school.

15:25.297 --> 15:27.564
Oh, you're a saint.

15:27.599 --> 15:31.468
I love it. I love connecting
with the young people.

15:31.502 --> 15:33.603
Although I know those boys
are undressing me every time

15:33.637 --> 15:35.871
I drop a piece of chalk.

15:35.906 --> 15:38.173
Yeah. Well, maybe we should
hold onto our chalk, hmm?

15:38.208 --> 15:39.942
They're boys! It's cute.

15:39.977 --> 15:42.244
John...

15:42.278 --> 15:45.314
Oh, there it is! There it is!

15:45.348 --> 15:48.417
- The Vivien Blake bitch face!
- Excuse me?

15:48.451 --> 15:50.051
I didn't want to say anything,

15:50.086 --> 15:54.223
but you were my favourite
character on "Sunrise Bay".

15:54.257 --> 15:55.857
- Thanks.
- It's true.

15:55.891 --> 15:59.060
He lived for "Sunrise Bay".

15:59.095 --> 16:01.463
I could be doing cartwheels in a thong

16:01.498 --> 16:04.566
in front of that television,
which I have done,

16:04.601 --> 16:08.169
but if your show was on, I
was as good as wall paper.

16:08.203 --> 16:10.038
Hey, how many people did
you slap on that show?

16:10.072 --> 16:12.007
I don't care.

16:12.041 --> 16:14.142
She can't remember,
there were so many slaps.

16:14.176 --> 16:15.744
Enough about me.

16:15.778 --> 16:20.548
Let's talk about you signing this contract.

16:20.582 --> 16:23.217
Well, somebody is in a
little hurry, ain't she?

16:23.252 --> 16:25.453
No, no. We're not in a hurry. No.

16:25.487 --> 16:27.140
- Aren't we?
- No. We're not. No.

16:27.141 --> 16:31.425
- Really?
- There it is again! Bam!

16:31.460 --> 16:34.094
- Okay, I'll tell you what, Vivien...
- Moira.

16:34.129 --> 16:36.564
I will go ahead and sign off on the sale...

16:36.598 --> 16:39.033
- Good.
- ... For a slap.

16:42.904 --> 16:45.205
Excuse me?

16:45.239 --> 16:47.607
I've always wanted to be
slapped by Vivien Blake.

16:47.642 --> 16:50.110
It's true. We've role-played
it like a thousand times,

16:50.145 --> 16:52.512
but it's not the real thing.

16:52.547 --> 16:54.981
You'd like me to slap you?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.716
- Yeah.
- I don't think...

16:56.750 --> 16:59.018
Well, don't think. Just do it. Slap me.

16:59.053 --> 17:00.920
- He wants you to slap him.
- I won't.

17:00.954 --> 17:02.121
- Slap him, Moira.
- Go ahead and slap him.

17:02.156 --> 17:04.156
Slap my husband, Moira.

17:04.192 --> 17:05.659
- John, I won't!
- Slap him or I'll slap him.

17:05.693 --> 17:07.627
- Slap me!
- I won't.

17:07.662 --> 17:09.896
- Slap me like a bitch!
- Sign the fucking contract!

17:18.137 --> 17:21.174
Okay.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.510
Um... this has been a lot of fun,

17:24.544 --> 17:27.213
but I'm starting to smell a
little too much like uh, campfire,

17:27.247 --> 17:29.448
and denim and plaid and stuff so... bye.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.620
Your choices are beer or beer.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.556
I assume a pint glass
is out of the question?

17:37.591 --> 17:39.225
You came! How was dinner?

17:39.259 --> 17:40.926
Um... worse than this?

17:40.960 --> 17:42.428
Although at this point it's
sort of a moving target.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.962
Here hold this.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.964
So there are no guys for me here.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.066
But it was kind of nice to just
like to flex the old muscle.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.001
Put your thumb over the tube.

17:50.036 --> 17:53.705
Agh, I kind of wanna just go for it but...

17:53.740 --> 17:57.008
- But sometimes it doesn't work out, I guess.
- Yeah.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.310
- Okay, put the tube in your mouth.
- What? Uh...

17:59.345 --> 18:01.346
Yeah. Just open your throat.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.281
And go down, 'cause you're tall.

18:03.315 --> 18:05.550
Okay. David, how long are
you gonna be doing this?

18:05.584 --> 18:08.953
Okay, just come and get
me after you vomit, okay?

18:08.987 --> 18:10.187
Just widen your throat!

18:13.925 --> 18:15.926
You!

18:18.997 --> 18:22.399
- Chug!
- Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:22.433 --> 18:25.602
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:33.578 --> 18:36.146
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:36.180 --> 18:37.614
Are you ready?

18:56.600 --> 19:00.904
And that's the last one there! Done!

19:02.539 --> 19:05.074
Already.

19:05.109 --> 19:07.576
There you go, Johnny, congratulations.

19:07.611 --> 19:09.845
Thank you very much. Thank you.

19:09.879 --> 19:12.515
Just remember one thing, okay?

19:12.549 --> 19:16.285
This is my town and you're
gonna play by my rules.

19:16.320 --> 19:20.189
Comprende?

19:20.223 --> 19:23.091
I'm just messing with you, man!

19:23.126 --> 19:25.694
Come on!

19:25.728 --> 19:29.464
- Wow.
- Or am I?

19:29.498 --> 19:32.500
No. I am.

19:32.535 --> 19:35.237
- Moira! Shall we?
- Yeah.

19:35.271 --> 19:37.372
Jocelyn, thank you for
an unforgettable evening,

19:37.406 --> 19:39.541
I will be dining out on this for years.

19:39.575 --> 19:40.775
I'll send you the recipes.

19:40.810 --> 19:44.846
Yes, Jocelyn, words can't express.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.716
Seriously, Johnny, good
luck selling the town.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.918
- You sure gonna need it.
- Why's that?

19:50.953 --> 19:52.954
Well, it took a while
to sell the first time.

19:52.988 --> 19:55.824
I mean, it was on the
market for like what 20 years

19:55.858 --> 19:57.758
before you bought it.

19:57.792 --> 20:00.294
20 years?

20:00.329 --> 20:01.595
Yeah. I mean, most people just
thought it was a waste of money

20:01.629 --> 20:03.264
that it would never sell, you know?

20:03.298 --> 20:04.966
Who in their right mind would buy it!

20:05.000 --> 20:06.567
Then along came you.

20:14.726 --> 20:18.954
John! Did you know this town
was on the market for 20 years

20:18.955 --> 20:20.040
before we bought it?

20:20.130 --> 20:22.263
How would I know that?
W... why would I know that?

20:22.297 --> 20:24.499
I didn't know that.

20:24.534 --> 20:27.402
But look, let's look at the bright side...

20:27.436 --> 20:29.103
There is no bright side.

20:29.138 --> 20:31.472
This is the dark side of the moon, Johnny.

20:31.507 --> 20:34.910
And we'll be here another 20 years,
tucked in a crater, lost to all.

20:34.944 --> 20:36.444
Johnny well, you know what?

20:36.478 --> 20:38.446
I think that's being a little dramatic.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.948
Yes! It's dramatic!

20:40.982 --> 20:45.019
Sweetheart! We got the thing signed, okay?!

20:45.054 --> 20:46.854
And if we have to fix this
town up before we sell it,

20:46.888 --> 20:48.622
then we fix it up.

20:48.657 --> 20:50.958
We fix it up, bit by bit.

20:50.992 --> 20:52.726
And it's gonna take hard
work but we can do it

20:52.761 --> 20:55.162
because we're Roses.

20:55.196 --> 20:58.298
- And there is nothing we can't do...
- Hi... hi...

20:58.332 --> 21:01.201
- You're being super loud right now.
- I can hear you thought the headphones!

21:01.235 --> 21:03.771
So if you can just wrap it up in here.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.138
10 to a 5. Thanks.

21:08.643 --> 21:11.311
I feel good about this. I really do.

21:21.437 --> 21:22.487
What the hell is this?

21:22.689 --> 21:23.521
The town sign.

21:23.523 --> 21:25.690
Bag boy at the grocery store.

21:25.692 --> 21:26.658
Which is what?

21:26.660 --> 21:28.559
40, 45-something and hour?

21:28.561 --> 21:29.794
"Good riddance,"

21:29.796 --> 21:31.429
is what they said.

21:31.431 --> 21:33.398
Are we having a bad day, honey?
