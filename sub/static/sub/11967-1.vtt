01:19.813 --> 01:22.474
<b>JACK OF THE RED HEARTS</b>

01:23.234 --> 01:26.234
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

01:27.552 --> 01:29.018
- Come here.
- Okay.

01:31.222 --> 01:33.593
We did it. We did it!

01:33.626 --> 01:35.328
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:45.771 --> 01:48.641
<i>Miss me? It took you
forever to get me.</i>

01:48.674 --> 01:50.343
<i>Worst part? Best part?</i>

01:50.376 --> 01:53.746
<i>There is no best part.
That family sucked.</i>

01:53.778 --> 01:56.448
<i>You should be with me.
I'm family. I'm 18 now.</i>

02:30.782 --> 02:32.350
Glory.

02:32.383 --> 02:35.187
Glory, honey, come on.
It's time for sleep.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.048
Glory. Come on, sweetie pie,
it's time to go to sleep.

02:37.049 --> 02:37.657
No!

02:37.689 --> 02:39.358
- It's time for sleep. Come on.
- No!

02:39.390 --> 02:41.727
- No!
- Come on, listen to Mommy.

02:41.759 --> 02:43.195
Come on, sweetie.
It's okay.

02:50.235 --> 02:51.905
She's down.

03:04.316 --> 03:07.219
I can't keep on moving these
balances around, it's...

03:07.252 --> 03:08.520
Just think about
all the money we save.

03:08.554 --> 03:10.656
Never having help before,

03:10.688 --> 03:12.290
me doing everything myself.

03:14.293 --> 03:16.695
I'm sorry. That makes it
sound like I don't do anything

03:16.729 --> 03:18.764
and I happen to be...
I work, okay?

03:18.796 --> 03:21.834
What the hell do you
think I do all day?

03:21.866 --> 03:24.436
Get my nails done.
Talk about boys.

03:24.469 --> 03:27.706
Yeah, well, you know, it's not
like I dreamt about being an IT guy.

03:27.740 --> 03:28.540
At least
you're out in the world.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.243
I'm "out in the world"?

03:31.276 --> 03:32.844
I work in a cubicle, Kay.
A cubicle.

03:32.877 --> 03:34.246
- A cubicle?
- Yeah.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.781
- A cubicle sounds heavenly.
- Really?

03:35.813 --> 03:38.350
You have no idea
what I do all day.

03:38.383 --> 03:39.751
No, I don't have any idea
what you do all day,

03:39.784 --> 03:42.288
because you don't tell me
what you do all day.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.521
I mean, are we gluten free
this week?

03:43.555 --> 03:44.522
"Yes, we're gluten-free
this week."

03:44.556 --> 03:46.259
Well, then why the hell
is she having Sun Chips?

03:48.794 --> 03:52.665
Because sometimes you just have
to avoid a total meltdown.

04:13.985 --> 04:15.820
Glory, stop.
You see this face?

04:15.854 --> 04:18.357
This is Daddy's angry face.

04:18.389 --> 04:20.026
Time to sleep, Glory.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.395
I guess I'll sleep
in here, okay.

04:37.608 --> 04:39.344
U.2.T...

04:39.377 --> 04:41.046
Hey, when do I get my tattoo?

04:41.079 --> 04:43.315
You can't handle it.
You're afraid of paper cuts.

04:45.016 --> 04:47.552
Hey, she's like my twin.

04:47.586 --> 04:49.989
Yeah. Totally.
Exactly like you.

04:52.990 --> 04:54.793
Hey, support the Red Cross.

04:56.627 --> 04:57.896
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:00.932 --> 05:02.435
- Two...
- Two...

05:02.468 --> 05:03.503
Forty cents...

05:05.870 --> 05:07.406
Two dollars and
forty-two cents...

05:08.639 --> 05:10.442
I'm hungry.

05:10.475 --> 05:12.411
Shut it, Coke.
We don't got enough yet.

05:16.648 --> 05:18.751
Do you think I'll look
like Mom when I grow up?

05:19.785 --> 05:21.520
Sure. Of course.

05:21.552 --> 05:23.822
I think I'm starting to
forget Momma now.

05:23.855 --> 05:25.824
Coke, she's only been gone
a couple of years.

05:33.432 --> 05:34.800
- Him?
- Yeah, go.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.504
Hey, this, sir, is for
the Red Cross.

05:43.875 --> 05:44.943
Dick.

05:45.711 --> 05:46.846
What's it say?

05:48.547 --> 05:51.016
"Are you good with kids?"

05:51.048 --> 05:52.517
What do you think?

05:52.550 --> 05:53.819
I'm not a kid.

05:55.853 --> 05:58.490
I'll be back. -Where do
you think you're going?

05:58.524 --> 05:59.891
Get on the rocks, Coke,
and what?

05:59.925 --> 06:01.394
- Chill.
- Exactly.

06:02.461 --> 06:03.429
I'll be back.

06:34.759 --> 06:35.560
Thanks, babe.

06:41.899 --> 06:46.204
What is this, the third or fourth
family she's pulled you away from?

06:46.237 --> 06:48.206
And impersonating the
Red Cross is a felony.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.576
Did she tell you that? You want
to end up like your sister?

06:50.608 --> 06:52.076
Where is she?

06:52.110 --> 06:53.545
Jack!

07:10.963 --> 07:11.764
No.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.665
Coke.

07:22.673 --> 07:23.675
Hey!

07:26.211 --> 07:28.448
Hey, Max! Sit!

07:29.514 --> 07:31.015
Sit, sit.

07:31.048 --> 07:32.116
Sit!

07:32.149 --> 07:33.685
Lay down.

07:33.718 --> 07:35.721
Lay down. Good boy.

07:35.754 --> 07:37.689
Yeah, good boy.

07:37.723 --> 07:40.725
Man.
Yo, what up, girl?

07:40.759 --> 07:43.829
- Hey, Dais.
- Where have you been?

07:43.862 --> 07:45.965
You been hiding somewhere?
Where you been staying?

07:45.997 --> 07:49.032
Nowhere good. Squatting some
with Jeremy and those kids.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.502
All right.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.137
Yo, wait.
He ain't allowed inside.

07:52.170 --> 07:54.507
Relax, Dais, neither am I.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.141
Let's go.

07:56.173 --> 07:58.610
So where's Coke at?
I thought you got her again.

08:00.045 --> 08:01.780
Shit. I did.

08:01.812 --> 08:03.781
But then my damn
probation officer...

08:03.814 --> 08:05.084
She... She don't quit.

08:07.119 --> 08:10.055
Man, poor kid must
have been terrified.

08:10.088 --> 08:13.959
Shit, if they place her, they gonna
put her somewhere you can't find her.

08:13.992 --> 08:15.294
Who's the girl with
the funky teeth?

08:15.326 --> 08:17.696
Got to be her little brother's
guardian, you know?

08:17.728 --> 08:19.231
Yo, I don't remember.
Tania. Tany...

08:20.966 --> 08:22.634
Yo, but it ain't enough
to be 18.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.638
You got to have a real job.
A real place to live, man.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.939
Well, that's what this is, see.
"Room and board."

08:33.845 --> 08:34.812
Shit.

08:34.846 --> 08:37.883
You still know that guy
on staff at Hollygrove?

08:37.916 --> 08:39.951
You ain't bustin' her
out of that place!

08:39.985 --> 08:42.754
No, just to call her
and talk to her.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.222
Just give them a call,
see if she's there.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.696
I suppose you want me
to check on this too.

08:50.729 --> 08:53.266
Yeah. Set me up good,
like we used to.

08:56.168 --> 08:57.036
All right.

08:58.269 --> 08:59.672
I'll call her...

09:03.741 --> 09:05.810
If you do something for me.

09:15.019 --> 09:16.922
<i>Hello?</i>

09:16.955 --> 09:18.657
<i>Hi, I'm calling from
an employment agency.</i>

09:18.690 --> 09:20.993
<i>I saw your flier.</i>

09:21.025 --> 09:23.828
Thanks for calling
but, you know,

09:23.861 --> 09:26.966
I think I found someone
actually already. So...

09:26.999 --> 09:30.168
<i>Yeah? Okay. But maybe just in case
I could get your information.</i>

09:30.201 --> 09:32.705
<i>I mean, you never know.</i>

09:32.738 --> 09:34.173
<i>Well, she's
coming at four today,</i>

09:34.206 --> 09:36.642
<i>so there's really no point,
but, all right.</i>

09:40.979 --> 09:42.648
<i>Yeah, cool.
What's the play?</i>

09:42.681 --> 09:44.682
<i>Okay, so her name
is Kay Adams.</i>

09:44.716 --> 09:46.686
<i>She gonna interview
another girl at four, okay?</i>

09:48.419 --> 09:52.123
<i>You get there first,
head her off, take it over.</i>

09:52.157 --> 09:55.860
<i>Yeah, but you got to be super
legit, okay? Like seriously.</i>

09:55.894 --> 09:58.096
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

09:58.129 --> 10:00.966
<i>You mean, like, when I played that
door-to-door Bible selling gal.</i>

10:03.067 --> 10:05.803
<i>No, no, no. No, no.
Like that art therapy chica.</i>

10:05.836 --> 10:07.438
<i>You know,
the one from Hollygrove.</i>

10:07.471 --> 10:11.043
<i>Yeah, yeah. Or "Paint the
feelings behind the feelings."</i>

10:13.678 --> 10:17.015
Donna,
have you had problems

10:17.048 --> 10:18.983
with your voice
messages before?

10:19.017 --> 10:21.153
I didn't get a message.
I'm sorry.

10:21.186 --> 10:23.122
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

10:23.154 --> 10:25.757
We really wanted
to save you the trip out here.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.269
Honey?

10:37.302 --> 10:38.236
Honey, I can't...

10:40.004 --> 10:42.240
Mark, is she hungry?

10:42.274 --> 10:43.676
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

10:43.708 --> 10:45.710
Does she need tinkle?

10:45.744 --> 10:46.945
I think there was a
little bit of a mix-up.

10:46.977 --> 10:50.048
You see, her husband
already hired someone.

10:50.081 --> 10:52.717
But you know what, we are definitely
gonna hang on to your resume

10:52.750 --> 10:53.584
in case
she doesn't work out.

10:53.619 --> 10:55.721
Why am I even cleaning
this mess up?

10:55.754 --> 10:58.190
This woman should know what
she's getting herself into.

10:58.222 --> 11:01.225
Okay, who are you again?

11:01.259 --> 11:02.794
I'm... I'm Kay's cousin.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.738
- Donna? Hi.
- Yeah. That's me.

11:13.739 --> 11:14.973
Is everything okay?

11:15.005 --> 11:17.141
Yeah. That was just my ride.

11:17.174 --> 11:19.077
I... I forgot my resume in
the car, but I have it.

11:19.110 --> 11:20.211
Great. Come on in.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.786
Please, sit down.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.257
So can I get you some water?

11:32.289 --> 11:33.858
Tea? Shot of whiskey?

11:35.427 --> 11:36.528
Just kidding.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.764
You said you'd worked
with autistic children before?

11:41.265 --> 11:44.102
Yeah, here.

11:44.135 --> 11:46.370
Is that the same as
what you emailed me, yeah?

11:46.403 --> 11:48.340
Yep. Well, you know
what they say,

11:48.373 --> 11:50.209
you can never be
too prepared.

11:51.176 --> 11:52.778
You're my kind of person.

11:52.811 --> 11:53.879
Okay.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.983
Come on.

11:58.015 --> 11:59.283
Three years at
the same daycare,

11:59.317 --> 12:01.419
and your supervisor spoke
very highly of you.

12:01.452 --> 12:04.088
I checked your references.
Very complimentary.

12:04.121 --> 12:05.990
So, sit down.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.328
- Tell me about yourself.
- Tell me about you!

12:10.361 --> 12:15.867
When did you first find out that
Glory was, differently abled?

12:15.900 --> 12:19.270
Please, no need to be politically
correct around here.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.774
If she were "differently
abled" I'd be thrilled.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.509
She was four.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.979
That must've been
very hard for you.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.415
Just felt like my heart was ripped out
of my chest and served on a cracker.

12:30.447 --> 12:33.117
Other than that, it was fine.

12:33.150 --> 12:36.020
Now, as for you, you worked with
autistic kids at the daycare?

12:36.053 --> 12:37.389
Yes. Absolutely.

12:37.422 --> 12:40.359
And are you more into
ABA or Greenspan?

12:46.063 --> 12:47.899
Basically, I... I don't care
what you call it.

12:47.932 --> 12:50.302
It's, whatever works
for each child.

12:51.469 --> 12:53.205
That's good. I like that.

12:53.238 --> 12:56.041
And, tell me
about Rebecca.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.811
Rebecca?

12:58.844 --> 13:00.846
Your supervisor said
you had a very special bond

13:00.879 --> 13:02.548
with a little girl
named Rebecca.

13:02.581 --> 13:06.851
Right, Rebecca.
Sweet precious Becky.

13:08.186 --> 13:09.955
Ms. Appleby said
she was a terror.

13:12.123 --> 13:14.225
Not to me she wasn't.

13:14.259 --> 13:16.361
Okay.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.432
That'll be Glory.
Come on.

13:26.937 --> 13:28.006
No!

13:31.275 --> 13:32.977
- Slow down! Slow...
- Glory.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.112
She's been in a tantrum
the entire drive home.

13:35.145 --> 13:38.015
Honey, honey, Mark.
This is Donna.

13:39.884 --> 13:42.120
- Hi, Mr. Adams.
- Hey.

13:42.153 --> 13:42.762
Sorry...

13:42.763 --> 13:44.590
Do you want to go meet
our little baby girl?

13:44.623 --> 13:46.091
Come on.

13:47.057 --> 13:48.326
Just as I thought.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.564
Sweetie.

13:59.070 --> 14:00.439
Can you say, "Hi, Donna"?

14:03.274 --> 14:04.509
<i>Such a pretty girl.</i>

14:06.110 --> 14:07.446
<i>Say "Hi, Donna."</i>

14:10.282 --> 14:13.051
Bye, Donna.

14:13.083 --> 14:15.119
She meant to say hi.
Trust me.

14:20.591 --> 14:23.361
She doesn't talk much?

14:23.394 --> 14:25.297
She can talk spontaneously

14:25.330 --> 14:27.199
when she wants
to eat something, but...

14:31.336 --> 14:33.572
So is she like good at
math or something?

14:33.605 --> 14:38.310
<i>Glory's no Rain Man.
No genius savant upside.</i>

14:38.342 --> 14:39.978
But we like to think she has
an exceptional personality.

14:43.548 --> 14:44.950
What you got there?

14:46.051 --> 14:46.919
So, what d'you think?

14:48.352 --> 14:49.420
Easy peasy, right?

14:50.054 --> 14:51.089
Yeah.

14:54.392 --> 14:55.326
So I start work on Monday.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.296
And I wanna get Glory
used to you right away.

14:57.328 --> 14:59.463
So, just to double-check,

14:59.496 --> 15:01.599
you're available immediately,
tomorrow?

15:01.633 --> 15:05.103
That'll give me a few days to
show you "all things Glory."

15:05.135 --> 15:06.570
Will you do it?

15:06.604 --> 15:11.276
She's adorable,
and you both seem great.

15:11.308 --> 15:14.078
But, I really can't take
a pay cut right now...

15:14.111 --> 15:15.579
Twenty dollars an hour.

15:15.613 --> 15:17.449
Yeah, maybe we can
talk about this.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.951
There's nothing more
we can do.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.320
Yeah. -We really need
the help right now.

15:25.056 --> 15:27.026
Well, you know,
I'll make it work.

15:28.158 --> 15:30.227
Great!

15:30.260 --> 15:33.231
Okay, so, 8:00?

15:33.697 --> 15:36.100
Okay.

15:36.134 --> 15:39.037
- Sure. Tomorrow.
- Yeah. Tomorrow. Bye, Donna.

15:39.070 --> 15:44.076
Honey, I finally get
to go back to work.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.211
I really, really wish you had
talked to me first.

15:47.245 --> 15:49.248
Honey, don't be a downer.

15:50.315 --> 15:52.350
Okay, everybody
raves about her.

16:25.082 --> 16:25.985
Hey.

16:27.251 --> 16:28.286
Hey.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.400
What are you dressed up
like that for?

16:41.432 --> 16:44.168
Hey, I know you're not
really mad at me,

16:44.201 --> 16:45.669
you're just trying
to punish me.

16:45.702 --> 16:47.238
I am mad at you.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.041
But I'm 18 now.

16:49.073 --> 16:51.609
If they get me
it won't be juvie anymore.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.178
It'd be real jail with
really bad people.

16:54.211 --> 16:55.447
But you are a bad person.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.416
Come on, Coke.
Don't say that.

16:57.448 --> 16:59.517
I'm doing my best.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.552
And no one's supposed to
call me Coke anymore.

17:01.586 --> 17:02.821
What?

17:02.854 --> 17:06.090
Jack and Coke is
"not appropriate."

17:06.124 --> 17:08.093
Who said that?
Elizabeth say that?

17:10.761 --> 17:13.298
Jack and Coke goes
with good times.

17:13.329 --> 17:15.634
That's you and me, right?
Good times!

17:15.665 --> 17:18.135
Excuse me? Hey?

17:18.169 --> 17:20.739
Okay. I got a job.
I'm getting us a place.

17:20.771 --> 17:22.173
Just don't buy
into the bullshit.

17:24.241 --> 17:27.412
Okay. ABA.

17:27.444 --> 17:33.818
Applied Behavior,
Behavioral Analysis Therapy.

17:33.852 --> 17:37.189
It's like, giving treats
as rewards and shit.

17:37.221 --> 17:39.191
Yep. You're a pro.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.527
"Stimming?"

17:42.559 --> 17:45.830
Yeah. It's like doing something over
and over again, to stimulate yourself.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.399
Girl, I do that
all the time.

17:47.432 --> 17:49.434
You do it too!

17:50.434 --> 17:52.437
Okay, so how's the dad like?

17:53.337 --> 17:54.638
I got it.

17:54.672 --> 17:55.673
And the mom?

17:57.642 --> 17:59.577
That bitch is wack.

17:59.611 --> 18:00.812
Shit.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.346
Man, I got no choice.
I gotta stick it out.

18:04.615 --> 18:06.617
- Okay.
- How's this look?

18:16.594 --> 18:17.528
Hello?

18:23.601 --> 18:24.403
Didn't tell you they had
a son, did they?

18:26.336 --> 18:28.405
Don't be silly.

18:28.439 --> 18:30.542
Welcome, Donna. This is
our son, Robert. -Thanks.

18:30.575 --> 18:31.844
Robert, be nice.

18:33.678 --> 18:37.382
So, It's not Bob.
Not Robbie.

18:37.414 --> 18:38.549
Just Robert, okay.

18:39.217 --> 18:40.319
Okay.

18:42.452 --> 18:45.289
You gonna let me in, Robert?

18:45.323 --> 18:46.391
Are you here to save the day?

18:47.424 --> 18:48.493
Wah-wah!

18:48.893 --> 18:50.729
Wah-wah!

18:50.761 --> 18:52.897
Donna?
Donna, in here.

18:55.833 --> 18:58.202
This is your cell phone.

18:58.236 --> 18:59.838
All our numbers
are already... See?

18:59.871 --> 19:02.274
- Just so you know.
- Thank you.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.576
And, as for computer, you can
use the one in the kitchen.

19:04.608 --> 19:06.443
So what d'you say,
we start in 10 minutes?

19:06.477 --> 19:08.413
Sure, yeah. That's great.

19:17.989 --> 19:19.790
In here.

19:19.824 --> 19:20.892
Hi, Glory.

19:20.924 --> 19:22.594
Look who's here, Glory.

19:22.626 --> 19:24.596
Can you say
"Hi, Donna"?

19:24.628 --> 19:26.230
Hi, Donna.

19:26.263 --> 19:29.600
Progress.
You got a "hi."

19:29.634 --> 19:31.903
All right, let's start
in the kitchen. -Okay.

19:31.935 --> 19:33.672
She aspires to the empyrean.

19:37.575 --> 19:39.711
Her supplements.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.846
The digestive enzymes
are especially important...

19:41.878 --> 19:43.948
They create the most
potent effluvium.

19:43.981 --> 19:46.350
Robert, you'll be late
for school. Out, out, out.

19:48.452 --> 19:52.290
So, she takes
all of these in one day?

19:53.657 --> 19:55.660
Dude. Dude.

19:56.394 --> 19:57.528
Dude.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.432
You're not gonna
guess this.

20:01.465 --> 20:03.667
My sister's new
babysitter is hot.

20:03.701 --> 20:05.537
- Hell no.
- Unequivocally, man.

20:05.569 --> 20:06.971
I'm not even kidding.
She's...

20:07.005 --> 20:10.642
She's a blazing beauty. Like, she's...
I open the door...

20:10.674 --> 20:12.543
Her eyes were so captivating.

20:12.576 --> 20:14.913
How hot are we talking,
like a solid nine, ten piece?

20:14.945 --> 20:16.880
No, dog, I'm talking
12, 15...

20:16.913 --> 20:19.250
Twelve, 15?
I'm talking 12, 15.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.519
And, dog, she just graduated
college so she's like,

20:21.551 --> 20:23.754
- 25, 26? I don't know.
- What, 26?

20:23.788 --> 20:25.257
She's a woman, dog.
She's not a girl.

20:25.289 --> 20:27.259
- You gotta go for it.
- I plan to, man.

20:27.291 --> 20:28.459
Dude, you got
to hook me up with that.

20:28.492 --> 20:30.528
I... I have the car.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.630
First. I've managed to
get Glory an interview

20:32.663 --> 20:34.932
with this amazing new school.

20:34.965 --> 20:37.968
It's a... It's a long shot
because frankly, well...

20:38.001 --> 20:40.371
But her public school doesn't
challenge her enough.

20:40.404 --> 20:41.572
Or, at all.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.675
So the interview's in a month.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.378
Well, a little more
than a month.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.812
Does that sound like
a good short-term goal?

20:47.845 --> 20:49.648
- Yeah.
- Ta-da.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.716
<i>This is your Bible.</i>

20:51.749 --> 20:53.852
I tried to write everything
down but it's impossible.

20:53.884 --> 20:56.855
You're just gonna have to pay
attention and follow me around.

20:56.887 --> 20:58.622
You're gonna keep a record
of everything in this book.

20:58.655 --> 21:01.893
Diet. Very important.

21:01.925 --> 21:04.462
Casein-free, gluten free.

21:05.863 --> 21:08.365
We've...
We've had some issues.

21:08.398 --> 21:10.692
Let's just say, if
your kid goes for almost

21:10.693 --> 21:12.569
two weeks without
a bowel movement,

21:12.603 --> 21:14.939
it's time to go to the
for a poop extraction.

21:14.971 --> 21:16.540
Good times.

21:17.808 --> 21:18.609
Let's get her in the car.

21:29.953 --> 21:32.790
- Hi. This is... This is Donna.
- Hi.

21:32.824 --> 21:33.925
Hi, Donna.
Nice to meet you.

21:33.958 --> 21:34.926
Nice to meet you.

21:37.394 --> 21:38.529
You got this.

21:40.064 --> 21:41.466
You know what to do.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.702
Go ahead.

21:44.736 --> 21:47.439
Glory's logbook. Right...

21:47.471 --> 21:49.507
- Here. I forgot...
- Over here is fine.

21:49.539 --> 21:51.009
- Yeah.
- And that's Glory's...

21:51.041 --> 21:53.077
Actually, I've got this.

21:53.111 --> 21:55.414
Come on, Glory.
Let's go.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.024
Well, I never thought I'd, have
to repeat the fourth grade again.

22:06.057 --> 22:07.592
I bet...

22:08.826 --> 22:11.363
So how's this, work?

22:11.395 --> 22:13.731
The first rule is we're not
here to talk to each other.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.005
Okay, so under
the "Chauffeur" tab,

22:21.038 --> 22:22.740
you'll see how to catch a ride
from school to therapy

22:22.773 --> 22:24.675
with Parent Transit.

22:24.709 --> 22:25.811
I've scheduled it for every
Tuesday and Friday.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.018
Hi.

22:34.050 --> 22:36.019
- This is Donna.
- Hi.

22:36.053 --> 22:37.456
Pam is speech and
language therapist.

22:41.759 --> 22:44.496
Hey. This is Donna.

22:44.528 --> 22:46.131
Matt. Occupational therapist.

22:49.133 --> 22:51.436
That kid has to wear
those all the time.

22:51.469 --> 22:53.671
He can hear water running
through the pipes.

22:53.703 --> 22:55.440
Lot of these kids
have sensory issues.

22:55.472 --> 22:57.575
Autism pretty much sucks.

22:57.607 --> 22:59.443
Am I talking too much?

22:59.477 --> 23:02.046
I haven't had anyone to talk
to in years. This is fun.

23:02.078 --> 23:03.681
Kay! Hey, How are you?

23:03.713 --> 23:05.149
Elaine, hi!

23:05.182 --> 23:06.483
Hi, Glory!

23:06.517 --> 23:08.620
We should go through this.

23:08.653 --> 23:10.521
Glory, what do you say?

23:10.988 --> 23:13.158
Hi, Donna.

23:13.191 --> 23:15.460
This is Donna,
Glory's new companion.

23:15.492 --> 23:17.162
Glory, you get a new friend.

23:17.194 --> 23:19.029
So, how's Danny?
How's... How's everything?

23:19.063 --> 23:20.999
He's great.
We mainstreamed him last year.

23:21.031 --> 23:22.800
Although he's still brushing up
on some articulation with Pam...

23:22.834 --> 23:24.936
He's...
He's totally recovered?

23:24.969 --> 23:26.638
Well...

23:26.671 --> 23:28.706
He'll be furious if I'm not
here to pick him up on time,

23:28.739 --> 23:31.076
but that's most kids for ya.
Gotta run.

23:39.483 --> 23:41.586
Recovered? Recovered?

23:41.618 --> 23:42.920
I mean, I'm happy
for them, I am.

23:42.953 --> 23:45.123
But they did nothing
and he's better.

23:45.155 --> 23:47.491
And we tried
everything, and...

23:52.896 --> 23:54.432
I love you, girlie.

23:55.665 --> 23:57.067
I'd kill for you.

24:02.105 --> 24:03.474
Glory?

24:06.210 --> 24:07.711
Elphan.

24:07.744 --> 24:08.946
Say it better.

24:12.782 --> 24:15.586
- Elephant.
- Good job, girlie.

24:15.619 --> 24:16.553
What's your favorite?

24:16.586 --> 24:17.588
Red one.

24:18.955 --> 24:20.557
Jelly bean! Jelly bean!
Jelly bean!

24:21.759 --> 24:23.161
Okay, one more.

24:24.828 --> 24:28.232
She can do it
when she's motivated.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.092
And don't overdo it
with the jelly beans.

24:30.093 --> 24:30.701
Okay.

24:30.734 --> 24:31.569
Just enough
to keep her attention.

24:33.570 --> 24:35.673
Thanks to the ABA we can
get her attention at all.

24:36.807 --> 24:38.809
Yeah.

24:38.843 --> 24:41.846
And it's thanks to the ABA
that we are so in debt.

24:43.881 --> 24:46.684
One hundred and fifty
thousand dollars.

24:46.717 --> 24:49.120
- My gosh.
- Youch.

24:49.153 --> 24:51.823
Thanks. That's...

24:51.855 --> 24:55.058
Try the red ones.
Glory's favorite.

24:55.092 --> 24:57.195
- Mine too. It's really good.
- Good.

25:00.631 --> 25:01.500
Let's wait for Mark.

25:02.732 --> 25:03.967
Okay. I'm sorry.

25:04.999 --> 25:05.636
- There you are.
- Hey.

25:06.604 --> 25:08.273
Just in time to say grace.

25:08.306 --> 25:11.610
Excellent. Just dressing up
for Sunday dinner. Thank you.

25:16.012 --> 25:18.015
I want tat-o's please.

25:18.048 --> 25:21.786
Thank you, dear Lord, for the
food we are about to eat.

25:21.818 --> 25:23.555
For the hands
that prepared it.

25:23.587 --> 25:25.889
- I want tat-o's please.
- Thank you for...

25:25.923 --> 25:28.159
For Donna,

25:28.192 --> 25:31.162
the lovely woman who is about
to be Glory's companion.

25:31.194 --> 25:32.797
- Thank you for our health...
- I want tat-o's please.

25:32.829 --> 25:35.899
...and Glory's continued
development. Amen.

25:35.932 --> 25:38.970
And for Robert and his
good friend Dudley.

25:39.002 --> 25:40.237
And for my job.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.673
We thank you. Amen.

25:42.707 --> 25:46.611
Amen. -So how are things
in your life, boys?

25:46.644 --> 25:49.247
Everybody's raving about how
great State's gonna be.

25:49.279 --> 25:50.115
It'll be fine, honey.

25:51.882 --> 25:53.585
- Glory, no.
- Wonderful.

25:53.617 --> 25:54.586
It'll be swank.

25:55.685 --> 25:57.355
It'll be cool.
We got my car.

25:57.387 --> 25:59.323
Your car?
He's not driving your car.

26:00.758 --> 26:03.260
- I want 'tat-o's please.
- Glory!

26:05.328 --> 26:07.331
I want my 'tat-o's.

26:07.365 --> 26:09.934
Donna, the whole point is for her
to talk. Not punish her for it.

26:17.008 --> 26:18.242
Donna.

26:20.344 --> 26:21.746
Mark, could you...

26:21.778 --> 26:23.847
Come here, sweetie.
It's all right.

26:23.881 --> 26:27.085
Glory, sweetie.
It's okay.

26:27.117 --> 26:28.653
She's accustomed to taking
things of our plates.

26:28.685 --> 26:30.588
It's the only time we can
have any adult conversation.

26:32.355 --> 26:33.791
What a total con.

26:34.959 --> 26:36.061
Exactly.

26:38.194 --> 26:40.230
I mean...

26:40.263 --> 26:43.067
Your compliance only reinforces
her manipulation, Kay.

26:43.099 --> 26:43.901
That... That's all.

26:45.869 --> 26:49.673
This is exactly what
I've been saying for years.

26:49.707 --> 26:51.909
Now suddenly everyone's an
expert when I'm the one who's...

26:51.942 --> 26:53.979
No. I mean, she has a point,
does she not?

26:58.449 --> 27:00.018
Go on, sweetie.
Let's go to the kitchen.

27:02.452 --> 27:03.355
We're having dinner.
I don't understand.

27:06.190 --> 27:07.292
Nice work, Dad.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.228
Excuse me?

27:12.096 --> 27:13.330
I was agreeing with you.

27:13.364 --> 27:14.365
No, you were agreeing
with her.

27:20.171 --> 27:21.773
I'm sorry, Donna.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.973
It's okay. I'll eat
in the living room.

27:24.174 --> 27:25.276
Thank you.

27:27.044 --> 27:30.348
We can do everything the same.
Just with Donna, okay?

27:31.949 --> 27:35.119
She's been friends with
other girls like you.

27:35.152 --> 27:37.188
And Mommy will be
home by six, so...

27:39.323 --> 27:42.994
Everything's gonna be fine.

27:43.027 --> 27:46.064
I mean, you got to give them a taste
of their own medicine, right?

27:46.096 --> 27:47.865
Maybe you should study
the natives a little while

27:47.897 --> 27:49.400
before you try
and evangelize them.

27:51.134 --> 27:52.302
Does he always talk like that?

27:52.336 --> 27:55.339
Yeah. I don't though.
You know, I'm chill.

27:57.741 --> 28:00.243
So, Donna,
tell us about yourself.

28:00.277 --> 28:02.913
You go to college?

28:02.946 --> 28:04.915
Yeah. Where did you,
where did you go to college?

28:04.949 --> 28:06.384
Yeah.
It must have been fun.

28:06.416 --> 28:08.086
What did you study?

28:08.118 --> 28:09.853
Like, can you
buy alcohol?

28:09.886 --> 28:11.722
Dude, shut up! -Do you
have friends in the area?

28:11.756 --> 28:13.324
I'm gonna go eat with your dad.
Where do you party?

28:13.356 --> 28:16.461
I have a Cadillac if you wanna
go for a ride in it some time.

28:16.493 --> 28:18.895
Wait.
Where... Damn.

28:18.929 --> 28:21.966
Dude, yo, bro,
I swear if you don't, I will.

28:36.279 --> 28:38.115
Your mom just, I don't know...

28:39.383 --> 28:41.752
I thought maybe if you...

28:41.786 --> 28:42.887
I mean, you wanna
talk or something?

28:42.920 --> 28:43.955
No. I don't.

28:44.922 --> 28:46.391
Look, Robert...

28:47.290 --> 28:48.759
Dad, I'm busy right now.

28:52.930 --> 28:53.798
You need something?

28:55.499 --> 28:57.067
No.

28:57.101 --> 28:58.169
All right, then.

29:06.943 --> 29:08.312
I'll be upstairs
if you need me.

29:21.357 --> 29:23.394
One of the moms at
Sing-and-Swing recommended her.

29:23.426 --> 29:25.462
And how old is she?

29:25.496 --> 29:27.031
I don't know. Graduated
college a couple years ago.

29:27.064 --> 29:28.365
Early twenties?

29:28.398 --> 29:29.967
- Where did she graduate?
- Community college.

29:31.868 --> 29:33.437
What's with
the gazillion questions?

29:34.171 --> 29:36.240
We need her.

29:36.272 --> 29:38.342
- Eat your breakfast before...
- I already ate.

29:42.078 --> 29:43.380
Dudley's gonna
be here in five.

29:46.884 --> 29:48.185
What? No.

29:50.354 --> 29:50.955
Donna?

29:53.123 --> 29:55.459
Donna?

29:55.491 --> 29:57.127
Door's locked.

29:57.161 --> 29:57.996
Are you up?

30:00.597 --> 30:01.532
Donna?

30:05.236 --> 30:06.103
Hi...

30:06.135 --> 30:07.872
Not ready?

30:07.904 --> 30:10.907
I have allergies...

30:10.941 --> 30:13.044
First day, remember, under
the "Weekly Schedule" tab.

30:13.076 --> 30:14.846
You take full charge of Glory

30:14.878 --> 30:16.480
about 30 minutes
before I go to work...

30:19.450 --> 30:21.318
Put clothes on. Chop-chop.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.855
Honey, honey. Relax, okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

30:23.887 --> 30:26.057
This is not the impression I wanna
make on my first day at work.

30:26.089 --> 30:28.024
I understand that, but you're gonna
be fine. Glory's gonna be fine.

30:28.057 --> 30:30.961
Everybody... -Nothing is
fine unless I make it fine.

30:30.994 --> 30:32.562
Hey.

30:32.596 --> 30:35.400
- No, can you just... God.
- Okay, okay, okay...

30:41.137 --> 30:42.941
Peace be among everybody.

30:47.944 --> 30:50.114
Mommy loves you, okay?

30:50.146 --> 30:53.183
Eyes. Eyes. Mommy's eyes.

30:56.220 --> 30:57.989
You be good.

30:58.021 --> 31:01.192
- Be good.
- Yes, I'll be good too.

31:01.224 --> 31:02.159
At least I'm gonna try.

31:05.628 --> 31:07.163
This will help.

31:07.196 --> 31:08.932
Here...

31:08.965 --> 31:10.700
Call me, okay?
Anything at all, just...

31:10.701 --> 31:11.568
Of course, yeah.

31:11.602 --> 31:12.603
And work on her teens, or...

31:12.635 --> 31:14.070
Okay. Don't worry.

31:14.104 --> 31:15.139
Just go already. We're cool.

31:16.406 --> 31:17.474
...Glory.

31:19.076 --> 31:20.144
I'll see you soon.

31:21.178 --> 31:22.347
You be good.

31:24.213 --> 31:25.515
Not too many
jelly beans, okay?

31:26.683 --> 31:27.518
Okay.

31:29.653 --> 31:31.389
Okay Glory.
Come on, let's go.

31:32.556 --> 31:34.192
Hey, let's go.

31:35.992 --> 31:37.461
Come on, let's go.

31:40.029 --> 31:41.098
What's wrong with you?

31:42.266 --> 31:45.002
Hey, okay, here's the deal.

31:45.035 --> 31:47.971
You don't rat on me,
I don't rat on you. Got it?

31:48.005 --> 31:49.374
Let's go.

31:51.709 --> 31:53.411
Come on, Glory.

31:55.378 --> 31:57.214
Look, the bus is here.

31:58.449 --> 32:02.420
Shit,
we're on the short bus.

32:02.452 --> 32:04.689
Short bus! Short bus!
Short bus! Short bus!

32:04.721 --> 32:06.924
Short bus! Short bus!
Short bus! Short bus!

32:17.267 --> 32:20.203
Hey, see. A.

32:20.237 --> 32:22.239
A. See? Look.
That's what it looks like.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.508
Do this.

32:28.479 --> 32:30.047
It works.

32:30.079 --> 32:32.215
- Seriously?
- It does.

32:48.632 --> 32:51.068
I think, Scotty
took your logbook.

32:53.136 --> 32:54.739
Scotty? Scotty?

33:02.078 --> 33:02.980
Okay.

33:11.355 --> 33:14.724
Okay, so I'm saying
we did your teens

33:14.758 --> 33:18.129
and your...
Your sequence picture cards.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.297
Good.

33:20.297 --> 33:21.466
All right.

33:29.105 --> 33:31.041
That's gross.

33:31.075 --> 33:31.676
What's wrong with you?

33:38.548 --> 33:40.283
Don't move, all right?

34:21.324 --> 34:22.492
Glory!

34:24.293 --> 34:26.196
No, no, no, no, no, no!

34:28.731 --> 34:30.768
What the hell!
Okay, so just stay...

34:34.804 --> 34:36.706
Okay, don't move. I'm going
to get you down, okay?

34:37.739 --> 34:39.110
Don't move.

34:40.210 --> 34:40.844
How did you get up there?

34:42.277 --> 34:43.380
Don't move, okay.

34:45.282 --> 34:46.417
Glory!

34:46.449 --> 34:48.251
Stay where you are, all right?

34:48.284 --> 34:49.853
There's some sick
party's at State.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.456
We can't party. They're
going to know we're 17.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.523
Think things through, man.

34:53.556 --> 34:54.791
Who's gonna buy us
the liquor in the first place?

34:54.824 --> 34:58.194
Two words. Donn-a.

34:58.228 --> 35:00.164
My God!
Dude, stop the car.

35:00.197 --> 35:01.798
Just stay... Shit!

35:01.831 --> 35:03.333
Are you seeing this?

35:03.367 --> 35:04.502
My God in heaven!

35:12.608 --> 35:14.244
Nice going!
I got her.

35:14.878 --> 35:15.746
Sorry!

35:18.815 --> 35:20.518
- You missed the...
- I didn't see the ladder.

35:20.550 --> 35:21.619
...the bright yellow ladder.

35:21.652 --> 35:23.387
I didn't see it, but...

35:23.420 --> 35:24.722
It's all right.
Happens to the best of us.

35:24.755 --> 35:26.691
We were just taking a break.
Jeez, Bob.

35:29.492 --> 35:31.594
She doesn't get how
to move backwards.

35:31.628 --> 35:32.863
She never learned to crawl. She can't
alternate her limbs like that.

35:32.896 --> 35:34.499
But you knew that, right?

35:36.934 --> 35:38.702
Hello. Hey.

35:39.869 --> 35:43.173
Hey. Hey.

35:43.206 --> 35:44.674
- Shape is a diamond.
- What are you doing up here?

35:44.708 --> 35:45.910
- Shape is a diamond.
- What?

35:47.476 --> 35:50.947
Yeah, it's a diamond.
I see it. I see it.

35:50.981 --> 35:52.950
Diamond... -You can't
be up here, sweetie.

35:52.983 --> 35:54.952
- Diamond...
- We gotta get down, okay?

35:54.985 --> 35:56.921
You ready to go? Come on.

35:56.954 --> 35:59.957
I'll walk. I know you've
done this a million times.

35:59.989 --> 36:01.558
Come on, Glory. Come on.

36:01.592 --> 36:02.893
Slowly...

36:02.925 --> 36:05.728
One foot, two foot.

36:05.762 --> 36:07.298
There we go.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.432
Fourteen.

36:08.465 --> 36:09.800
Fourteen.

36:09.833 --> 36:11.735
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

36:11.768 --> 36:13.836
I did it! I did it!

36:13.869 --> 36:18.208
It all came back to me. Making
calls, problem solving, spreadsheet.

36:18.242 --> 36:19.543
Hi, Robert.

36:19.576 --> 36:20.978
Glory went roof-walking today.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.746
I forgot to warn
you about that.

36:23.780 --> 36:27.918
Yeah. No. I told you, it's something
about being a Pi, the empyrean.

36:27.951 --> 36:29.753
She loves it. Never falls.

36:31.887 --> 36:33.590
You a narc, Bobert?

36:35.492 --> 36:38.662
Getting a tan?
I could have mentioned that.

36:38.695 --> 36:40.898
This is Mommy's
happy face! Happy! Happy!

36:40.931 --> 36:42.900
Are you gonna mess
with "happy happy"?

36:42.932 --> 36:45.936
Mommy's, Mommy's happy face.
Happy face.

36:45.969 --> 36:48.606
Happy, happy, happy face.
Happy, happy, happy face.

36:50.539 --> 36:54.344
You completed
two full sequence pictures?

36:59.382 --> 37:01.818
Did you really complete two
or did you try two?

37:02.853 --> 37:05.889
We completely tried two,

37:05.922 --> 37:07.891
but, you know,
we'll do better tomorrow.

37:07.923 --> 37:09.427
Right, Glory?

37:22.606 --> 37:24.575
Knock-knock.

37:24.608 --> 37:26.443
You draw
all these yourself?

37:27.610 --> 37:29.313
They're really good.

37:29.346 --> 37:30.548
- What's that?
- Nothing.

37:30.981 --> 37:32.850
It's nothing.

37:32.882 --> 37:36.019
So, I got your room,
and you got this man-cave.

37:36.052 --> 37:38.422
I haven't been
up there in a while.

37:38.454 --> 37:40.590
You got a problem
with me, Robert?

37:40.623 --> 37:41.791
Because, you know,
the first time I saw you

37:41.824 --> 37:43.893
I thought maybe
we could be friends.

37:45.829 --> 37:47.798
You know, I'm just here
to help out Glory.

37:47.831 --> 37:50.501
And I know your parents
need my help too, so...

37:50.534 --> 37:52.570
Maybe we can try to get along.

37:53.003 --> 37:55.506
For their sake?

37:55.539 --> 37:57.441
- Okay. Yeah.
- You know...

37:57.474 --> 38:00.344
I could help you out too.

38:00.376 --> 38:03.681
With like your homework
or something?

38:03.713 --> 38:07.083
Okay, what... What college did
you go to again? Remind me?

38:07.117 --> 38:08.452
I forget.

38:09.619 --> 38:12.323
God, you're such an asshole.

38:12.356 --> 38:14.925
And what's with that
"Wah-wah" crap, anyway?

38:14.958 --> 38:17.394
What? Are you serious?

38:17.427 --> 38:19.363
Helen Keller's first word,
"Wah wah."

38:21.498 --> 38:23.434
Helen Keller,
Anne Sullivan...

38:23.467 --> 38:26.369
W-A-T-E-R.

38:26.402 --> 38:29.505
I thought Anne Sullivan was like a
patron saint to all you therapists.

38:29.539 --> 38:31.975
Yeah. Well,
knock it out, Bobert.

38:32.007 --> 38:35.378
You look retarded.

38:35.411 --> 38:37.047
You know, you're not
supposed to use that word.

38:59.668 --> 39:01.904
Stop! Stop!

39:01.938 --> 39:03.640
Shit.

39:03.672 --> 39:04.941
Glory...

39:05.641 --> 39:06.777
Shut up.

39:12.481 --> 39:13.550
Glory, no.

39:14.083 --> 39:16.152
Glory!

39:16.186 --> 39:17.555
Glory, I...

39:18.889 --> 39:20.958
Just do it!

39:22.826 --> 39:24.594
It's okay, it's okay.

39:25.494 --> 39:27.431
Glory, come on, you know this.

39:27.463 --> 39:29.766
No, don't do that to me.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.535
Get up, it's not noodle time.

39:31.568 --> 39:33.604
- Noodle.
- Get up. Glory, come on.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.005
What is this shape?

39:35.038 --> 39:36.840
- What is this shape?
- Glory, what is this shape?

39:36.873 --> 39:38.608
- What is this shape?
- What is this shape?

39:38.641 --> 39:40.009
You know this shape.

39:40.043 --> 39:42.112
Glory, come on.

39:42.144 --> 39:43.746
Get back up here, come on.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.482
- What is this shape?
- Glory!

39:48.818 --> 39:51.454
Calm down, all right?
Hey, just calm down, okay?

39:53.123 --> 39:54.557
Stop kicking!

39:54.590 --> 39:56.092
What happened?
What happened?

39:56.126 --> 39:58.429
- Where's the theratube?
- I don't know!

39:58.461 --> 40:00.030
- The theratube?
- What?..

40:00.063 --> 40:01.965
Her chew stick! Remember,
we went over this! -Yeah.

40:01.998 --> 40:03.300
Sorry. Okay. -She needs
something to chew on

40:03.333 --> 40:05.035
while we're getting her dressed.
Okay. Sweetie, there you go.

40:05.068 --> 40:07.104
Good girl. Good girl.

40:07.137 --> 40:09.606
All right, we went over this!

40:09.639 --> 40:13.577
Panties, undershirt,
then pants, then shirt.

40:13.610 --> 40:15.746
Don't ask me why the order
matters but it does. Okay?

40:15.778 --> 40:19.081
All right. I'm sorry. That's
a good girlie. All right.

40:19.114 --> 40:21.584
Get in your pants, and what
are we going to do now?

40:25.588 --> 40:26.990
Glory, stop.

40:27.923 --> 40:29.726
- Glory.
- Donna!

40:29.759 --> 40:31.728
This is a class, not a circus!

40:33.697 --> 40:38.202
Glory! Cut it out.
Jesus! God!

40:38.235 --> 40:39.836
Let's go!

40:41.804 --> 40:44.106
- All right.
- Shape is a diamond.

40:47.143 --> 40:49.146
...is a diamond.

40:49.179 --> 40:50.012
Diamond...

40:50.045 --> 40:51.181
Stop.

40:52.516 --> 40:53.584
Hey. Hey.

40:55.050 --> 40:56.554
Stay! Be good.

40:58.153 --> 40:59.623
I'll be back.

41:14.170 --> 41:15.139
Hello?

41:16.706 --> 41:18.876
- Jack?
- Shit!

41:19.943 --> 41:20.744
You. Inside.

41:22.746 --> 41:24.280
Hey, how's it going,
Elizabeth?

41:24.313 --> 41:26.916
- It's going good.
- Yeah. It's good to see you.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.987
You look good.

41:30.019 --> 41:32.155
You've completely
transformed, I see.

41:32.188 --> 41:33.657
- Thanks.
- After you.

41:37.827 --> 41:40.130
Okay, I'm going
to tell you one thing.

41:40.163 --> 41:42.132
Your probation officer
says you're in violation.

41:42.164 --> 41:45.302
And I'm instructed to call her
if you even come around here.

41:45.335 --> 41:47.538
Come on, Elizabeth,
don't call Miz!

41:47.570 --> 41:49.639
I'm going to call her
right now, unless you talk,

41:49.672 --> 41:51.207
and I want only the truth.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.943
You're going to place Coke.

41:52.976 --> 41:55.646
Yes, again.

41:55.679 --> 41:59.016
It won't be hard.
She's a cute kid.

41:59.048 --> 42:02.085
Can't you at least give Coke
her computer privileges back?

42:02.117 --> 42:05.288
So you two can plan your
next great escape? No way!

42:05.322 --> 42:07.291
But that's not fair. She should
be with me. I'm her family.

42:07.324 --> 42:09.559
I'm, I'm 18 now.

42:09.592 --> 42:10.560
I got a job, I got a place.

42:11.894 --> 42:13.730
I said, "Only the truth."

42:13.762 --> 42:15.898
No. That is the truth!

42:15.931 --> 42:17.934
I'm working as a babysitter
for a little girl.

42:17.967 --> 42:20.170
And she's autistic, so she
needs someone with her

42:20.202 --> 42:21.771
like all the time.

42:21.804 --> 42:23.005
And the pay is good.

42:23.039 --> 42:25.342
How did you even get this job?

42:25.375 --> 42:26.677
I convinced them.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.311
You lied to them.

42:28.344 --> 42:30.780
No. No, I'm doing a good job!

42:30.813 --> 42:32.848
And they really like me.
It's easy.

42:32.882 --> 42:36.019
I can get you
a recommendation letter!

42:36.052 --> 42:38.088
With their contact
information on it?

42:38.121 --> 42:40.190
Yeah. Yeah... Hey.

42:40.222 --> 42:42.224
See! See! Look!

42:42.257 --> 42:44.360
Look. It's real.

42:44.393 --> 42:45.628
See?

42:47.364 --> 42:49.333
How long have you been
doing this?

42:49.365 --> 42:52.034
I don't know. Not long.

42:52.068 --> 42:56.306
One month from now,
you still have this job,

42:56.338 --> 42:58.675
we'll talk about maybe
keeping you two together.

43:03.646 --> 43:04.315
No!

43:05.748 --> 43:06.649
Shit!

43:07.317 --> 43:10.186
No, shit!

43:10.219 --> 43:12.622
Glory? Glory? Hey!

43:13.389 --> 43:15.125
Shit. Glory?

43:17.193 --> 43:18.596
Glory?

43:19.362 --> 43:20.364
Glory?

43:22.364 --> 43:23.600
No!

43:27.903 --> 43:29.405
Damn! Shit!

43:37.079 --> 43:39.315
God!

43:39.349 --> 43:41.751
Where were you?

43:41.784 --> 43:43.920
You got to say
something, damn it!

43:52.262 --> 43:54.097
Hi. Mani-pedi time!

43:54.130 --> 43:56.199
- Want one?
- No. I'm okay. Thanks.

43:56.231 --> 43:59.135
My God, what's wrong with
your hands? What happened?

43:59.168 --> 44:01.270
I just fell.
It's no big deal.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.675
I smell cigarettes.
Do you smell cigarettes?

44:10.246 --> 44:12.148
Glory. Glory, not now.

44:12.181 --> 44:13.783
Say something, damn it!

44:17.920 --> 44:19.155
Can you watch Glory
for a moment?

44:19.188 --> 44:21.090
Where's Donna?

44:25.961 --> 44:29.166
I think she has
personal problems.

44:29.199 --> 44:31.768
Apparently, she didn't make it
to Sing-and-Swing at all today.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.335
I mean, where
the hell were they?

44:33.369 --> 44:36.039
And the other day I think she lied
about what they accomplished.

44:36.072 --> 44:37.307
Right...

44:37.340 --> 44:39.809
Look, but...

44:39.842 --> 44:41.110
She just started! Why don't
you just give her a break?

44:41.143 --> 44:42.712
- Give her a break?
- Yeah.

44:42.746 --> 44:45.248
Have you seen her with Glory?
She's rough with Glory.

44:45.280 --> 44:46.416
You should have
seen her hands.

44:46.449 --> 44:48.452
I mean, I think
she's hiding something.

44:48.485 --> 44:50.220
I'm going to make
some calls tomorrow.

44:50.253 --> 44:52.856
What, are you're gonna
quit your job?

44:52.889 --> 44:55.858
With one-on-one attention Glory should
be showing some improvement by now!

44:55.891 --> 44:58.127
Well, God forbid it's Glory's fault
she's showing no improvement!

44:58.161 --> 45:00.230
What did you just say?

45:00.262 --> 45:02.465
She's not going to be ready
for that interview. Never!

45:04.467 --> 45:07.269
She's 11 years old, Kay.

45:07.302 --> 45:08.438
When are you going to get
that through your head?

45:17.981 --> 45:19.850
Is this is how you really
feel about Glory?

45:20.849 --> 45:23.085
I'm tired.

45:23.119 --> 45:26.724
I don't want to feel like we're
co-workers in a mental hospital!

45:29.192 --> 45:31.427
I want to feel like
we're married again.

45:53.115 --> 45:54.518
Glory?

45:54.550 --> 45:56.886
Hey, come on, you can
chew on this. Come on.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.454
Almost ready
for school.

45:58.487 --> 45:59.756
Come on. Hey.

46:00.422 --> 46:02.191
Girl, sit up.

46:02.224 --> 46:04.827
You're really worth
every penny, Donna.

46:04.860 --> 46:06.395
Now my parents aren't even
speaking to each other.

46:09.231 --> 46:11.101
Glory, hey.

46:11.134 --> 46:13.235
You know what?

46:13.268 --> 46:15.037
I'm thinking you're
no Anne Sullivan.

46:19.309 --> 46:21.178
Glory...

46:21.210 --> 46:22.411
Watch out. Roll over.

46:35.425 --> 46:39.028
<i>W-A-T-E-R.
Water! It has a name!</i>

46:39.061 --> 46:39.862
<i>W-A-T...</i>

46:41.130 --> 46:42.132
<i>Wa...</i>

46:42.599 --> 46:43.500
<i>Wa...</i>

47:09.893 --> 47:13.262
Okay, Glory.
No more free jelly beans.

47:13.295 --> 47:15.064
No more cigarette breaks.

47:15.097 --> 47:16.398
Your ass is mine now, okay.

47:16.431 --> 47:18.400
Glory, no Glory, sit!

47:18.434 --> 47:20.003
Glory, sit...!

47:20.036 --> 47:21.070
Stop.

47:21.670 --> 47:23.472
Hey, good stop.

47:23.505 --> 47:25.040
That was a good stop.
That was a good stop.

47:25.074 --> 47:27.376
Okay. Stay.

47:27.409 --> 47:30.312
Yeah. Okay. Good.

47:30.346 --> 47:32.481
I'm going to take your cards.
I'm taking these back.

47:32.514 --> 47:33.983
You'll get them back after.

47:34.016 --> 47:36.118
It's okay. It's okay.
Just take your spoon.

47:36.152 --> 47:37.653
Try with a spoon.
Try with a spoon.

47:37.686 --> 47:39.556
No, no, no, no!

47:39.588 --> 47:42.092
It's okay.
Here, try another one.

47:42.125 --> 47:43.092
Don't freak out.

47:44.494 --> 47:45.562
Glory, it's okay. Come on.

47:47.063 --> 47:47.898
Hey, no, no, no, no, no!

47:49.132 --> 47:50.432
No!

47:50.465 --> 47:52.568
Glory, hey, calm down.

47:52.601 --> 47:55.071
It's okay. I'm not going
to hurt you, okay?

47:56.672 --> 47:58.007
Come on, let go.

47:59.442 --> 48:01.043
Come here!

48:09.585 --> 48:10.920
Calm down!

48:14.657 --> 48:16.626
It's okay. Okay?

48:16.659 --> 48:17.494
Just take a break.

48:19.228 --> 48:20.530
All right.

48:20.563 --> 48:21.465
Good.

48:23.565 --> 48:25.634
We're going to try this
with a spoon.

48:25.668 --> 48:26.603
We'll do it together, okay?

48:30.672 --> 48:32.508
In your mouth.

48:33.476 --> 48:36.947
One more time. Come on.

48:36.980 --> 48:39.483
Glory come on, it's just sweet
potatoes. They taste good.

48:40.282 --> 48:42.184
No, no!

48:49.425 --> 48:51.461
Come here! Come on!

48:54.764 --> 48:57.267
Donna. Glory.
I'm home.

48:57.300 --> 48:59.068
- We're in here.
- Hi.

48:59.101 --> 49:00.469
There you are.

49:10.045 --> 49:11.948
We're out of yams.

49:15.184 --> 49:16.720
Look, improvement!

49:16.753 --> 49:18.655
She's sitting down.
She's eating with her spoon.

49:27.329 --> 49:28.398
Show mommy, honey.

49:31.567 --> 49:33.235
Glory. Eat.

49:33.268 --> 49:34.570
Eat.

49:34.603 --> 49:35.739
Glory. Eat.

49:45.280 --> 49:46.315
Good job, girlie.

49:49.684 --> 49:51.487
Give me five.

49:51.521 --> 49:53.223
- How.
- How.

50:07.135 --> 50:09.371
This better be cleaned up.

50:09.405 --> 50:10.607
Yeah, yeah.

50:25.253 --> 50:27.089
Thank you, girlie!

50:27.123 --> 50:28.258
Thank you!

50:32.695 --> 50:33.730
Finally.

50:43.106 --> 50:45.108
What else can you do,
girlie?

50:54.250 --> 50:55.585
Glory, you in here?

51:49.505 --> 51:51.141
- Hey, Kay.
- Hi.

51:51.173 --> 51:53.242
I am so sorry
I'm calling so late.

51:54.876 --> 51:56.480
<i>Is Glory bouncing
off the walls?</i>

51:58.347 --> 51:59.916
She's good.

51:59.949 --> 52:02.552
Good...

52:02.585 --> 52:05.255
Donna, listen, I... I know
this is not part of our deal,

52:05.288 --> 52:06.923
<i>but this audit.</i>

52:06.956 --> 52:08.658
No, it's okay.
Just spit it out. It's fine.

52:08.690 --> 52:10.426
Is there any chance
you could help with dinner?

52:12.494 --> 52:14.297
Forget it, forget it.
I shouldn't have asked.

52:14.329 --> 52:18.268
No, it's fine! I just,
I don't know how to cook.

52:18.300 --> 52:22.538
No, not anything elaborate, just
make spaghetti or something.

52:22.572 --> 52:23.507
How do you make spaghetti?

52:28.610 --> 52:31.580
Okay, I'll just walk
you through it.

52:31.614 --> 52:33.382
All right, okay.
So what's the first step?

52:33.416 --> 52:34.885
Okay, so there's a pot...

52:52.902 --> 52:54.403
Watch your step.

52:55.570 --> 52:56.706
There she is.

52:58.007 --> 52:59.476
Hey, Bethany.

53:00.443 --> 53:01.545
Bethany.

53:02.478 --> 53:04.713
Come here.

53:04.746 --> 53:06.215
I've a couple of people
I'd like you to meet.

53:08.351 --> 53:11.387
Just give her a little time,
she's been through a lot.

53:18.393 --> 53:21.730
Well, I looked online and I gotta get
my classes in by the end of the month.

53:21.764 --> 53:23.298
We gotta figure out what
dorm room I'm staying in.

53:23.331 --> 53:24.900
Focus on some work study.
Get some money in there.

53:24.934 --> 53:26.669
What do you think
about food too?

53:26.702 --> 53:29.405
The food at these
colleges is terrible.

53:29.438 --> 53:31.273
I mean, you've seen what
those kids eat, we can't.

53:31.306 --> 53:33.542
We're gonna have to get you
something healthy.

53:33.576 --> 53:35.043
I need to figure out where I'm
staying, not what I'm gonna eat...

53:35.077 --> 53:37.447
They'll tell you where you're staying.
This food is delicious.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.282
Yeah, quinoa's really high in protein.
Really?

53:39.315 --> 53:40.682
- I did know that.
- I need more.

53:40.715 --> 53:41.951
I need more. Give me more.

53:41.983 --> 53:42.918
- Here, protein.
- Delicious.

53:45.353 --> 53:47.356
Glory?

53:47.389 --> 53:48.924
What's she saying?

53:48.958 --> 53:50.593
I don't know.

53:50.626 --> 53:53.028
We haven't figured
that one out.

53:53.061 --> 53:54.896
We think it has something to do with
the conflict in the Middle East!

53:54.929 --> 53:57.666
Or maybe she's saying, "Daddy's
really fat! Daddy's really fat!"

53:57.699 --> 54:00.302
- Daddy's not fat.
- Daddy sometimes is fat.

54:00.335 --> 54:02.538
I want tatos please.

54:02.570 --> 54:04.039
I want tatos please.

54:04.072 --> 54:06.041
- Good asking, Glory!
- I want tatos please.

54:06.074 --> 54:07.743
Okay. Here you go.

54:07.777 --> 54:10.012
- This is awesome!
- Pretty awesome!

54:10.045 --> 54:11.513
- I want tatos please.
- This is amazing.

54:11.547 --> 54:12.715
I just gave you some.

54:14.617 --> 54:15.952
Okay.

54:15.985 --> 54:16.786
Who's that?

54:17.920 --> 54:18.887
Mommy.

54:19.954 --> 54:21.824
Mommy.

54:21.856 --> 54:23.293
Good. Good.

54:23.958 --> 54:25.327
And who's that?

54:25.360 --> 54:26.629
Hey. Who's that?

54:29.030 --> 54:30.967
That's you, Glory. That's you.

54:32.934 --> 54:34.304
That's you.

54:34.903 --> 54:36.639
No, I'm Jack.

54:37.672 --> 54:39.341
I'm Jack.

54:40.876 --> 54:44.747
You're Glory, I'm Jack.

54:44.780 --> 54:48.084
Glory. Glory. Glory.
Jack. Jack. Jack.

54:48.117 --> 54:50.053
Jack. Jack. Jack.

54:50.085 --> 54:53.021
No, no, no, no. Donna. Donna.
Donna. -Jack. Jack. Jack.

54:53.054 --> 54:55.057
Jack, Jack, Jack.

54:55.090 --> 54:56.826
Jack. Jack.

55:01.630 --> 55:03.666
It's been open
for about three months.

55:03.699 --> 55:05.668
Well, you know, it was
modeled after a lab school

55:05.701 --> 55:08.771
at the University of Chicago,
which I toured.

55:08.804 --> 55:10.539
So, you know.
ABA, everything...

55:10.572 --> 55:11.641
All under one roof!

55:11.673 --> 55:13.342
I know.

55:13.376 --> 55:15.978
Are you guys talking
about that new school?

55:16.010 --> 55:18.715
Glory has an interview there.

55:18.748 --> 55:21.016
Glory got an interview?
Are you kidding?

55:21.951 --> 55:22.818
Why?

55:24.119 --> 55:26.623
Not exactly her speed,
if you know what I mean.

55:27.789 --> 55:30.025
No. I don't know
what you mean.

55:30.059 --> 55:33.530
I mean, she's low functioning.
She'll never get in.

55:35.431 --> 55:37.067
Gosh. Good luck.

55:38.166 --> 55:39.435
I'm afraid she'll need it.

55:44.840 --> 55:45.942
Come on, Glory.

55:51.480 --> 55:53.449
Low functioning, my ass.

55:55.150 --> 55:58.019
Yo girl,
this place is crazy.

55:58.052 --> 56:00.021
What's with all of this?

56:00.054 --> 56:02.591
Yo Daisy, hold on.
I just gotta...

56:02.625 --> 56:03.925
All right, just sit.

56:03.958 --> 56:06.728
Just sit right there. Stay.

56:06.762 --> 56:09.632
I'm going to go and pick some stuff
out for you, okay? Don't move.

56:10.699 --> 56:12.501
Yo, this shit is wack.

56:12.534 --> 56:14.170
What up?

56:14.202 --> 56:15.938
See? It's like
a survival kit, you know,

56:15.971 --> 56:17.606
for when
the lights are too bright,

56:17.639 --> 56:18.474
when it's too noisy
and shit...

56:19.074 --> 56:21.476
And this too.

56:21.510 --> 56:23.913
- Why?
- Because it's fun.

56:23.945 --> 56:25.847
Okay, I gotta fly.
Bye, boo-boo.

56:25.880 --> 56:27.783
Hey, Dais?

56:27.817 --> 56:28.650
Live big.

56:30.652 --> 56:31.721
Hey.

56:31.753 --> 56:33.522
Glory?

56:35.824 --> 56:37.460
Glory?

56:37.492 --> 56:39.528
Hey, Glory?

56:39.561 --> 56:42.097
This isn't funny.

56:42.130 --> 56:43.799
Excuse me,
did you see a little girl?

56:43.833 --> 56:45.934
- Yeah. She just left.
- What?

56:45.967 --> 56:47.103
Shit!

56:47.135 --> 56:48.471
Glory?

56:49.838 --> 56:50.840
Glory?

56:51.873 --> 56:52.908
Glory?

56:57.646 --> 56:59.449
Have you seen a little girl?

57:01.217 --> 57:02.485
Hi...

57:03.152 --> 57:04.554
I lost Glory.

57:06.554 --> 57:07.456
All right,
just stop the car.

57:07.489 --> 57:10.225
Stop, stop.

57:10.259 --> 57:12.161
I'm so sorry. I just looked away
for a second... -No, no, no.

57:12.193 --> 57:15.096
- She just takes off. I understand.
- Okay.

57:15.130 --> 57:16.666
Where could she be?

57:19.735 --> 57:21.171
I got an idea. Come on.

57:23.873 --> 57:25.608
Dudley, come on.

57:25.641 --> 57:27.143
No, she goes
to this park sometimes.

57:27.175 --> 57:29.144
It's like her
little happy place.

57:29.177 --> 57:31.580
There she is!

57:31.614 --> 57:32.581
See, I told you.
She loves it here.

57:34.916 --> 57:35.985
Shit,
she's gonna fall.

57:36.018 --> 57:37.086
No, she's fine dude.
She's safe.

57:37.119 --> 57:38.488
She never falls.

57:42.123 --> 57:43.692
Yo, check out who it is.

57:43.726 --> 57:45.894
- Shit...
- Yo, Robby.

57:45.927 --> 57:47.996
You want me to help you? -No.
Just wait here and watch Glory.

57:48.030 --> 57:50.233
- Hey, guys.
- How's it going, man?

57:50.266 --> 57:51.733
Long time, no see?

57:51.766 --> 57:53.935
Who are those guys?

57:53.969 --> 57:56.938
They look like assholes
to me, I don't know.

57:56.972 --> 57:59.108
You said you were gonna
matriculate in the State, man.

57:59.141 --> 58:02.778
Yeah. I, I didn't get into the other
ones, so we're just kind of...

58:02.811 --> 58:04.280
No way.

58:04.313 --> 58:05.748
Hey, Glory.

58:05.780 --> 58:07.282
How the hell
did you get up here?

58:07.315 --> 58:09.951
You're like
a little red-headed ninja.

58:09.985 --> 58:10.619
What about Yale? Princeton?

58:11.887 --> 58:13.089
Same thing. I got waitlisted.

58:13.755 --> 58:14.956
Dude...

58:14.989 --> 58:17.526
Pathetic.
What happened to you?

58:17.559 --> 58:20.063
What happened?
Hey, baby...

58:23.699 --> 58:25.867
Come on, let's go.

58:25.900 --> 58:29.271
- Later.
- Wait, wait. What was that?

58:29.304 --> 58:32.641
Annoying is what it was, I mean,
Princeton, Yale, who gives a shit?

58:33.041 --> 58:34.777
Yeah.

58:34.809 --> 58:37.880
Who does? -Guys, guys!
Glory just talked to me!

58:37.913 --> 58:40.016
- What'd she say?
- What?

58:40.048 --> 58:41.518
Okay. So, I was talking
to her and I asked

58:41.519 --> 58:42.851
her how many fingers
I was holding up,

58:42.885 --> 58:45.755
and she said four and I was
actually holding up four fingers!

58:45.788 --> 58:47.856
Alert the media, dude.
She does that all the time.

58:49.358 --> 58:51.227
Hi, Jack. Hijack? See.
She's just babbling.

58:53.228 --> 58:54.730
No, she actually
was talking to me.

58:54.762 --> 58:55.663
I'm telling you, man,
she's just babbling.

58:55.697 --> 58:56.130
She's never done that before.
Now four?

58:58.300 --> 58:59.835
- Four.
- Yeah. Four.

58:59.867 --> 59:01.770
There's something weird...

59:01.804 --> 59:03.204
I don't know
about being up high.

59:03.237 --> 59:05.574
It's like it makes her smarter
or something up there.

59:08.110 --> 59:10.246
That thing you said
the first day, the...

59:10.278 --> 59:12.014
- The empyrean.
- Yeah.

59:12.047 --> 59:14.817
It's like reaching at the
highest point of the heavens.

59:14.849 --> 59:16.251
She's reaching for the stars.

59:18.253 --> 59:19.121
That's our Glory.

59:21.155 --> 59:23.326
Thanks, by the way,
for not giving me shit.

59:23.358 --> 59:25.694
We've all done it.
Seriously, it's all right.

59:26.996 --> 59:27.896
And...

59:29.764 --> 59:30.732
Thanks for that.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.336
Yeah.

59:38.373 --> 59:43.612
Mom and Dad would jump
at the latest thing,

59:43.646 --> 59:46.248
spare no expense
when it came to Glory.

59:46.280 --> 59:51.286
Any gadget, any quack
who had the cure.

59:51.320 --> 59:56.659
The compounding pharmacy
designer digestive enzymes...

59:56.692 --> 59:58.360
...the trips to the hyperbaric
oxygen chamber...

01:00:02.164 --> 01:00:05.901
And the one thing I wanted was
the amazing ab electrifier.

01:00:05.934 --> 01:00:07.303
Yes.

01:00:07.335 --> 01:00:09.704
I wanted it very badly.

01:00:09.737 --> 01:00:11.373
And they said no.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:14.076
And I couldn't believe it!

01:00:14.108 --> 01:00:16.679
They said it was a gimmick
and everything.

01:00:16.711 --> 01:00:18.648
I was 13! I wanted
the amazing ab electrifier.

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:20.617
Yeah.

01:00:22.684 --> 01:00:25.020
Those guys were my friends

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:28.958
up until my parents couldn't afford
to take me to McAllister's anymore.

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:30.159
So I started going
to public school, and...

01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:33.028
Dudley?

01:00:33.061 --> 01:00:34.130
Exactly.

01:00:59.253 --> 01:01:02.290
So does this mean you're going
to stop calling me Bobert now?

01:01:03.992 --> 01:01:05.394
Maybe.

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.931
Glory, I'm home.

01:01:09.965 --> 01:01:12.168
I...

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.336
Glory, come on.
Hey, Glory, come on.

01:01:16.771 --> 01:01:18.974
Dudley, okay, it happened man.

01:01:19.007 --> 01:01:21.110
Just...
Just a few minutes ago.

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:23.445
<i>- It was like...
- Dude, that's statutory rape!</i>

01:01:23.478 --> 01:01:25.847
<i>You're going
to put her in jail.</i>

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.982
We're not having sex, man. Just
get your head out of the dirt.

01:01:28.016 --> 01:01:30.152
This is... This was a moment.
This was real.

01:01:30.184 --> 01:01:32.822
This was us.
I kissed a woman!

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:35.123
<i>Okay. But if she's in jail, how are we
going to get the booze for the party?</i>

01:01:35.157 --> 01:01:37.293
This was just...

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.449
Okay, you're not getting this.

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:40.697
I can't talk to you right
now. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:01:49.271 --> 01:01:50.840
Shit!

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:52.307
Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:55.445
Okay, how many more days?

01:01:56.545 --> 01:01:58.414
Nineteen. Shit!

01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:03.219
Stupid!

01:02:06.487 --> 01:02:08.490
- Hey.
- Okay, okay.

01:02:08.523 --> 01:02:13.161
This is completely inappropriate
and it stops now.

01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:14.296
- What do you mean, we were just...
- The park...

01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:16.932
That was totally my fault.

01:02:16.965 --> 01:02:19.501
I was just trying to help
you out, but...

01:02:19.534 --> 01:02:22.404
The second time, the swings,
that was... That was totally you.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.042
Okay, well, we need
a tiebreaker.

01:02:28.076 --> 01:02:29.911
- What?
- A tiebreaker.

01:02:32.246 --> 01:02:33.815
One more?

01:02:33.849 --> 01:02:34.751
All right.

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:37.186
Yeah. Okay...

01:02:37.219 --> 01:02:38.354
All right.

01:02:46.061 --> 01:02:48.396
Okay, that should
hold you, Robert.

01:03:03.277 --> 01:03:04.480
Hero. Hero.

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.316
Glory.

01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:09.318
- Hey, Glory.
- How did you know that?

01:03:09.351 --> 01:03:12.387
Hero.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.022
She heard it all the way
from the kitchen.

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:17.059
- I can't believe it.
- It's a special song.

01:03:17.092 --> 01:03:17.994
- Hero.
- I'm getting there.

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:20.128
Ready?

01:03:44.952 --> 01:03:46.054
Ready?

01:04:12.681 --> 01:04:15.650
Let me see if I remember
this next verse.

01:04:33.702 --> 01:04:36.138
Ready?

01:06:29.451 --> 01:06:31.786
I know,
you almost got it.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.655
We just have one
more arm. Come on.

01:06:33.688 --> 01:06:35.257
We're almost there.
I know.

01:06:35.289 --> 01:06:37.793
- Having some trouble?
- Yeah. Almost.

01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:41.630
Hey, let's try this. Hey, Glory,
squishy time. Squishy time!

01:06:41.663 --> 01:06:44.333
Let me try this, okay.

01:06:44.365 --> 01:06:45.501
Yeah, lay down.
She loves this.

01:06:47.335 --> 01:06:48.670
- Squish, squish.
- Yeah, come on. Lay down.

01:06:48.702 --> 01:06:50.038
Works every time.

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:51.673
We can do this
any time of the day.

01:06:51.706 --> 01:06:53.307
Ready? Yes?
We're going to wrap you up

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.643
like a cheese roll.

01:06:54.675 --> 01:06:56.711
You're going to look
like a burrito,

01:06:56.744 --> 01:06:58.614
with rice and beans.

01:06:58.646 --> 01:07:00.349
And then we're going to lift you up.
Lift up her legs.

01:07:00.382 --> 01:07:03.318
And we're gonna
swing you, right?

01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:06.288
Say one, two...

01:07:06.855 --> 01:07:09.090
Three...

01:07:09.123 --> 01:07:10.725
Squishy! I got you!

01:07:10.759 --> 01:07:13.128
Squishy! Squishy!

01:07:13.161 --> 01:07:16.565
- Squishy! Squishy!
- Squishy! Squishy!

01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:19.300
- Squishy!
- You get her cozy.

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:21.803
It doesn't have to be all work
and therapy. You can try this.

01:07:23.438 --> 01:07:25.773
She likes Casper.

01:07:25.806 --> 01:07:28.176
I don't understand
the mysterious power

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.510
of Casper,
the Friendly Ghost, but...

01:07:29.543 --> 01:07:30.378
See you later.

01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:33.749
Take care of her.

01:07:33.782 --> 01:07:36.085
Casper? Okay.

01:08:05.514 --> 01:08:07.282
<i>- In the spice cabinet.
- Cabinet. Spice cabinet.</i>

01:08:07.315 --> 01:08:09.885
<i>- Which cabinet is that?
- Left of the dishwasher.</i>

01:08:09.918 --> 01:08:11.653
<i>- Eye level.
- What's it look like?</i>

01:08:13.288 --> 01:08:16.658
Low sodium beef?

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:19.394
Yeah, got it. Found it.

01:08:19.426 --> 01:08:21.529
<i>- How many?
- Just one.</i>

01:08:21.563 --> 01:08:23.198
One.

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:24.466
Yeah, I got it. Okay.

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:29.270
What else?

01:08:29.304 --> 01:08:31.738
<i>I don't know. What else
have you got? Tomato?</i>

01:08:31.773 --> 01:08:33.509
Yeah. I'll get
the tomatoes. Yeah.

01:08:34.943 --> 01:08:36.278
Okay.

01:09:10.444 --> 01:09:12.447
Sorry. Too loud?

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:15.384
No, I... I just
couldn't sleep.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:17.685
Come sit down.

01:09:21.622 --> 01:09:23.591
You like the book?

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.295
I love it. Thank you so much.
It's great.

01:09:27.761 --> 01:09:29.163
It really helps.

01:09:40.841 --> 01:09:42.577
I'm going to get some...
Something to drink.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.483
A fraud.

01:09:49.884 --> 01:09:51.185
What?

01:09:52.554 --> 01:09:54.523
That's what I feel like.

01:09:56.291 --> 01:10:00.229
I've been out of the workforce
too long. Everything's different.

01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:01.963
Nobody takes notes
on actual paper anymore!

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:05.667
They don't even talk on the
phone, everything is emailing.

01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:08.737
I just don't know the tech
stuff like these kids all do.

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:11.974
Half the time I don't even know
what they're talking about.

01:10:12.006 --> 01:10:14.576
I just feel like
I'm faking it all day long.

01:10:18.012 --> 01:10:19.981
Well, I'm sure you're
doing the best you can.

01:10:23.484 --> 01:10:24.786
Night.

01:10:24.819 --> 01:10:25.921
Good night, Donna.

01:10:38.065 --> 01:10:40.601
Gil, here's Mr. Riley.

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:42.538
Good save.

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:45.507
See you tomorrow.

01:10:45.539 --> 01:10:46.774
Say
"See you tomorrow," Scotty.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:47.842
Bye, Scotty.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.587
What is it?

01:11:00.988 --> 01:11:01.889
Red.

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:05.360
- Good.
- Red.

01:11:05.393 --> 01:11:06.528
What's the shape?

01:11:11.032 --> 01:11:15.304
What is the shape?
The shape is a heart.

01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:17.773
What's the card?

01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:21.609
What's the card?

01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:24.313
Is it jack?

01:11:25.646 --> 01:11:26.649
Jack...

01:11:29.016 --> 01:11:32.453
Jack of the red hearts.

01:11:33.921 --> 01:11:35.023
Good.

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:37.793
Good.

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:44.632
Yeah.

01:12:12.993 --> 01:12:13.996
Whoo!

01:12:32.479 --> 01:12:33.781
Jelly beans! Jelly beans!

01:12:46.627 --> 01:12:50.098
Hi, there. Is this, is this
Elizabeth Dunn from Hollygrove?

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:55.804
Hey, there. Okay. This is
gonna sound really weird,

01:12:55.837 --> 01:12:58.707
but do you know a...
A Jacquelyn Ferguson?

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:10.152
All right, this is fine.
Thanks.

01:13:11.819 --> 01:13:13.822
All right, Glory,
we're here.

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:16.859
Come on. Come on.

01:13:18.059 --> 01:13:19.628
I got you. Let's go.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.130
Yeah.

01:13:22.162 --> 01:13:23.898
Good girl. Good girl.

01:13:23.931 --> 01:13:26.434
Come on.

01:13:26.467 --> 01:13:29.104
Thanks.

01:13:29.136 --> 01:13:32.206
I know it's bright.
It'll be cool inside. Come on.

01:13:32.239 --> 01:13:33.841
Glory, come on.

01:13:33.875 --> 01:13:36.444
Hey. We're just going
to do this, okay?

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:38.447
We're just going
to go over here.

01:13:38.479 --> 01:13:41.682
Yeah. I'm going to talk with this
lady and you, play with the fish.

01:13:41.716 --> 01:13:43.118
All right?

01:13:43.150 --> 01:13:45.953
Hi...

01:13:45.987 --> 01:13:50.625
I have these forms and I just
wanted to find out where I...

01:13:50.658 --> 01:13:52.027
Who I turn them in to.

01:14:00.167 --> 01:14:04.072
No! No! No!

01:14:04.104 --> 01:14:07.575
No! No! -Glory, Glory. Glory.
Stop, stop, stop, stop...

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:11.513
No! No! No! No! No! No! -Stop it.
Stop it, stop. Don't hurt yourself.

01:14:11.546 --> 01:14:13.248
No! No! -Get your
hands off that child!

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.484
- What are you doing?
- It's okay, she's autistic.

01:14:15.516 --> 01:14:17.051
- She's just having a tantrum...
- Little girl, are you okay?

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.752
- No!
- Don't touch her.

01:14:18.786 --> 01:14:20.755
I'm her companion, okay?

01:14:20.787 --> 01:14:23.658
- She doesn't speak!
- No. No.

01:14:25.059 --> 01:14:26.994
- No.
- What's your name!

01:14:27.028 --> 01:14:27.996
No.

01:14:31.231 --> 01:14:32.701
What's your name?

01:14:39.073 --> 01:14:40.676
It's Donna...

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:46.213
Excuse me, room 203 please?
203?

01:14:46.247 --> 01:14:47.583
Thank you.

01:14:50.818 --> 01:14:52.753
- Honey, are you scared?
- Scared.

01:14:52.787 --> 01:14:55.557
- Are you hurt?
- Hurt.

01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:57.025
It's... It's called
echolalia, miss.

01:14:59.827 --> 01:15:02.831
I saw this young lady holding
the girl's arms very roughly...

01:15:02.863 --> 01:15:05.933
Yes, and she probably saved her from...
From running off.

01:15:05.966 --> 01:15:07.536
Glory's stronger
than she looks.

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:10.639
I... I have absolute
confidence in our helper here.

01:15:10.671 --> 01:15:13.541
Okay, Donna, let's go. I'm
sorry we've wasted your time.

01:15:16.043 --> 01:15:19.314
You take my daughter to Family
and Children's Services?

01:15:19.346 --> 01:15:22.050
Do you know what
those people can do?

01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:25.819
Is there something we've done
that you disagree with?

01:15:25.853 --> 01:15:28.789
Do you feel Glory's
not being treated well?

01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:30.892
It has nothing to do
with you, Kay.

01:15:30.925 --> 01:15:32.895
It has nothing
to do with this.

01:15:35.296 --> 01:15:39.768
I just don't want you
to not like me.

01:15:42.936 --> 01:15:43.838
What could possibly...

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:51.279
Listen, we...
We all have made our mistakes,

01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:53.548
we all have our regrets.

01:15:55.216 --> 01:15:58.153
I know I didn't make
Glory autistic. But...

01:16:00.755 --> 01:16:04.059
But when I started to see signs
that something's wrong, I...

01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:07.595
I just couldn't face it.

01:16:10.731 --> 01:16:14.836
The only thing... The only
thing everyone agrees on is...

01:16:14.868 --> 01:16:16.203
Is early intervention.

01:16:17.204 --> 01:16:18.940
The most crucial years.

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:22.210
And I missed it.

01:16:22.243 --> 01:16:24.312
Where would Glory be
if we'd started earlier?

01:16:24.345 --> 01:16:25.681
Would she...

01:16:27.047 --> 01:16:28.716
Would she be able to relate?

01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:32.653
Would she have friends?

01:16:33.988 --> 01:16:35.691
Would she call me Mommy?

01:16:38.192 --> 01:16:42.896
What can I do about it now?
Except my best, now...

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:45.900
It doesn't help her
if I beat myself up over it.

01:16:45.932 --> 01:16:47.801
Now tell me,
what were you doing

01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:49.871
at Family and
Children's Services?

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.010
I have a sister.

01:16:55.976 --> 01:16:57.778
Okay.

01:16:57.811 --> 01:17:02.984
We were in foster care
after my, mom got sick.

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.822
And, my mom,

01:17:08.389 --> 01:17:11.059
she didn't have anybody.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.662
Any family.

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.699
So, after she...

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:22.336
Yeah. We...
We didn't have anybody either.

01:17:23.738 --> 01:17:24.806
She died?

01:17:25.872 --> 01:17:26.807
Yeah.

01:17:30.177 --> 01:17:32.346
The last thing
she said to us was,

01:17:34.948 --> 01:17:36.817
"You two take care
of each other."

01:17:39.319 --> 01:17:41.389
It's like our...

01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:42.957
It's like our code, you know.

01:17:44.759 --> 01:17:45.860
U.2.T.C.

01:17:48.863 --> 01:17:51.833
So, that's...
That's why I was here.

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:55.237
I got to get my sister back.

01:17:58.372 --> 01:17:59.975
I'm sorry, honey.

01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:03.777
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:05.447
We're gonna get
your sister back.

01:18:06.514 --> 01:18:07.916
I'm gonna help you.

01:18:08.381 --> 01:18:09.451
Okay.

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.019
Okay.

01:18:11.918 --> 01:18:13.988
I'm so sorry.

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:15.389
- It's okay.
- Okay.

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:22.998
Hey. Whose is that?

01:18:33.039 --> 01:18:34.842
Donna, come on.
Let's go.

01:18:35.909 --> 01:18:36.912
Just...

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.751
I am so sorry, Mr. Adams.
It's a lifelong pattern.

01:18:42.783 --> 01:18:44.384
She's smoking cigarettes. She's
smoking cigarettes in the house!

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.086
No concern for the law.

01:18:46.119 --> 01:18:48.890
Child endangerment.
Criminal trespassing.

01:18:48.922 --> 01:18:50.492
- Honey?
- Theft.

01:18:50.524 --> 01:18:52.960
- Breaking and entering.
- Honey?

01:18:52.993 --> 01:18:54.429
In here.
Donna's room.

01:18:54.462 --> 01:18:56.264
I can explain.

01:18:56.296 --> 01:18:58.031
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah, that's my wife.

01:18:58.064 --> 01:19:00.335
What are you all doing
in Donna's room?

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:02.036
That's not her name, Mom.

01:19:02.069 --> 01:19:03.972
What? Excuse me, who are you?

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:05.239
I'm her probation officer.

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:06.807
Probation officer?

01:19:06.841 --> 01:19:09.177
Hello, Jacquelyn.
Been looking for you.

01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:11.179
Jacquelyn?

01:19:11.212 --> 01:19:14.115
Whatever she told you,
it's not the whole truth.

01:19:14.148 --> 01:19:16.217
I swear I can explain...

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:19.056
Mrs. Adams, I've
been sharing some of

01:19:19.057 --> 01:19:22.157
Jack's criminal record
with your husband.

01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:23.557
- Criminal record!
- Criminal record?

01:19:23.591 --> 01:19:25.794
We're lucky
we found her in time,

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:27.863
otherwise she could have done some
serious harm to your daughter.

01:19:29.095 --> 01:19:30.564
Harm?

01:19:30.597 --> 01:19:33.467
- All I did was help them...
- You think this is a joke?

01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:35.503
This is our family!
Glory is part of our family...

01:19:35.536 --> 01:19:38.405
- It's not like what she says.
- She says you're 18!

01:19:38.439 --> 01:19:40.141
She never graduated
from high school.

01:19:40.173 --> 01:19:42.143
But her credentials! I...

01:19:42.176 --> 01:19:43.878
I check... I checked
her references, remember...

01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:47.215
You checked
Donna Graham's references.

01:19:47.247 --> 01:19:49.349
This isn't Donna Graham.

01:19:49.382 --> 01:19:52.252
Misrepresenting your identity,
it's called Fraud.

01:19:52.286 --> 01:19:55.190
No, I did the job! Okay!

01:19:55.222 --> 01:19:58.326
You need to look for missing
checks and also credit cards.

01:19:58.359 --> 01:20:00.161
What, you mean like this?

01:20:00.194 --> 01:20:01.830
That... That was just
an old check.

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.331
Then what the hell is it doing
in your room? For what?

01:20:03.363 --> 01:20:05.833
I didn't use it!
I didn't use it for anything.

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:09.204
- I swear to God, I didn't do anything!
- You lied?

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:11.506
- You're not even a therapist?
- No.

01:20:11.538 --> 01:20:12.840
The part about
my sister is true!

01:20:12.873 --> 01:20:14.842
You're not a caretaker...

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:16.912
The whole daycare,
everything was a lie?

01:20:19.613 --> 01:20:20.915
I'm sorry.

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:26.387
I just... I needed to get
a job because I need

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.521
to get custody of
my sister, that's all.

01:20:28.989 --> 01:20:30.891
What sister?

01:20:30.925 --> 01:20:33.829
Well, fortunately, her sister has
been placed with a foster family.

01:20:35.262 --> 01:20:36.363
No!

01:20:50.344 --> 01:20:52.279
No! No! No!

01:20:54.314 --> 01:20:56.550
No. No. No...

01:21:00.154 --> 01:21:02.557
- Glory.
- No. No.

01:21:04.992 --> 01:21:07.262
Glory! You can't
stay with me, Glory.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:09.430
- Glory. Come on.
- No!

01:21:09.462 --> 01:21:11.231
You played us!

01:21:11.265 --> 01:21:13.034
I didn't mean to...

01:21:13.067 --> 01:21:14.636
Robert, what about
her interview?

01:21:14.668 --> 01:21:17.438
- You can drop the act, all right!
- No! No!

01:21:40.661 --> 01:21:43.698
So what would you
put in the Big Dipper?

01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:45.599
In the Big Dipper...

01:21:45.632 --> 01:21:49.938
I'd put... Tequila!

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:52.940
Tequila. Really.

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:55.610
Well, we better have lots of salt
and lime in the Little Dipper.

01:21:55.643 --> 01:21:57.345
What would you put
in the Big Dipper, Tina?

01:21:57.377 --> 01:21:59.212
Let's see,
what do I like that much?

01:21:59.246 --> 01:22:01.516
Coffee!

01:22:01.548 --> 01:22:04.418
Then the Little Dipper
better be full of cream!..

01:22:06.287 --> 01:22:08.990
Speaking of which,
let me go grab my coffee!

01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:11.025
I'll be right back.

01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:21.970
My God! Jack!

01:22:22.002 --> 01:22:25.206
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey!

01:22:25.238 --> 01:22:27.341
They wouldn't let me e-mail! But
I knew you'd find me! -It's okay.

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.725
I'll grab my stuff
and come to the back...

01:22:28.726 --> 01:22:29.176
Wait, wait.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.445
Worst part, best part.
Worst part?

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:34.582
These assholes make me
take vitamins at every...

01:22:34.614 --> 01:22:37.684
Hey. That's good!
That's what good assholes do.

01:22:37.717 --> 01:22:39.554
Best part?

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:41.156
Premium channels!

01:22:41.721 --> 01:22:43.657
They seem nice.

01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:46.293
And there are good
schools around here.

01:22:46.327 --> 01:22:48.663
- School is bullshit!
- No.

01:22:48.695 --> 01:22:51.698
No, I only said that 'cause of me...
'Cause I was full of shit.

01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:54.301
But you're good at school.

01:22:54.335 --> 01:22:57.505
Look, Coke, I'm not
taking you with me.

01:22:58.671 --> 01:23:00.273
But U.2.T.C.!

01:23:00.306 --> 01:23:02.042
- I know, Coke.
- U.2.T.C.!

01:23:02.076 --> 01:23:04.311
Coke, this is taking
care of you, okay.

01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:08.382
Didn't you
get us a place?

01:23:10.083 --> 01:23:11.219
No.

01:23:12.286 --> 01:23:13.320
No, I didn't.

01:23:13.354 --> 01:23:14.456
I'm sorry.

01:23:16.423 --> 01:23:18.326
You'll stay here. Okay.

01:23:20.094 --> 01:23:24.131
Okay, and they'll let us
keep in touch.

01:23:24.164 --> 01:23:27.335
Yeah. And you can tell me all
about what you're learning.

01:23:27.368 --> 01:23:29.404
What fun you're having.

01:23:29.436 --> 01:23:31.038
- How many friends you're making.
- No! No!

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:31.706
Hey, it'll be good.

01:23:33.073 --> 01:23:35.275
No, please, Please!

01:23:35.309 --> 01:23:38.179
Please.

01:23:38.212 --> 01:23:40.248
Jack,
take me with you!

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.216
Please just take me...

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:46.587
Please take me.
Take me.

01:23:48.421 --> 01:23:50.324
Jack!

01:24:48.615 --> 01:24:50.451
Go, go, go.
Shake this.

01:24:50.484 --> 01:24:51.319
There you go.
There you go.

01:24:57.457 --> 01:25:02.729
Shit, yo,
my girl is back!

01:25:05.431 --> 01:25:07.501
Come dance, girl. Come and dance.
Come and dance.

01:25:07.534 --> 01:25:08.702
Come. Come.

01:25:51.478 --> 01:25:52.913
No, Glory! Glory!

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:54.715
- I'll pick it up.
- Just... I'll pick it up.

01:25:54.747 --> 01:25:57.951
Glory. Okay. -I'll get the...
I'll just get the theratube.

01:25:57.984 --> 01:25:59.886
You know what, Mark,
let's just cancel it, okay?

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.788
- This is not going to work!
- Cancel?

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.622
But she can really do this!

01:26:02.655 --> 01:26:04.591
What kind of flipping impression do
you think she's going to make now?

01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:05.926
She's gonna do this.
We're gonna do this.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.795
This is gonna be okay.

01:26:07.828 --> 01:26:09.531
She's gonna be okay,
I promise.

01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:15.903
Kay? Mark?

01:26:15.935 --> 01:26:17.604
Hi! -Welcome to the
Exceptional Academy.

01:26:17.637 --> 01:26:19.472
- I'm Doctor Molina.
- Hi.

01:26:19.506 --> 01:26:21.409
This is Cynthia,
the psychologist

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:23.277
- who will be working with Glory today.
- So nice to meet you.

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:24.345
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.
- This must be Glory.

01:26:24.377 --> 01:26:25.979
- This is Glory.
- Hi, Glory.

01:26:26.012 --> 01:26:27.881
Glory, go ahead.
Say hi.

01:26:27.914 --> 01:26:29.417
- Welcome to our...
- No!

01:26:29.449 --> 01:26:31.685
- No! No!
- Sorry! It's okay, sweetie.

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:34.288
She... Yeah, she's a little
overwhelmed right now.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.722
- I'm sorry. There's so much going on.
- That's all right.

01:26:35.756 --> 01:26:37.490
Why don't we
all go together?

01:26:37.524 --> 01:26:38.893
That would be great. -That
would be great. Thank you.

01:26:38.926 --> 01:26:40.562
Come on.
You can come. Let's go

01:26:42.262 --> 01:26:43.296
It's okay.

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:50.004
Who else is calling you?
I'm right here.

01:26:50.037 --> 01:26:50.972
Dude, it's her.

01:26:51.939 --> 01:26:52.907
Dude.

01:26:53.873 --> 01:26:54.675
Hello?

01:26:55.509 --> 01:26:57.011
Dudley?

01:26:57.043 --> 01:26:59.846
I got to
make this quick.

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.516
I think the cops are here,
but just...

01:27:02.548 --> 01:27:04.719
Just tell Robert that,
that I need one more favor

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:08.823
and I'll never ask for anything
ever again, okay? Please?

01:27:08.855 --> 01:27:10.557
<i>Yeah. Screw him.
I'll... I'll do it.</i>

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.796
You idiot! I'm the one that
told the cops she'd be there!

01:27:16.829 --> 01:27:18.599
And I'm the idiot?

01:27:21.902 --> 01:27:22.936
What's your name?

01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:29.743
My name's Cynthia.

01:27:32.011 --> 01:27:33.780
Can you say "Hi, Cynthia"?

01:27:35.649 --> 01:27:36.817
Glory, Glory, you
can say "Hi Cynt..."

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:38.353
- Kay.
- Kay, Kay. Just...

01:27:41.421 --> 01:27:42.623
- Just let her be.
- Okay.

01:27:53.734 --> 01:27:56.370
Hey, Officers, wait, I'm not
armed, don't pepper spray me!

01:27:56.403 --> 01:27:57.938
How you guys doing?

01:27:57.970 --> 01:27:58.871
We're doing fine.
What can we do for you?

01:27:58.905 --> 01:28:00.841
My name is Dudley.
Pleasure to meet you.

01:28:00.873 --> 01:28:02.376
This is a new situation?

01:28:05.679 --> 01:28:06.980
...Uncomfortable
and scary.

01:28:10.016 --> 01:28:12.287
Come on.
Now go do your thing.

01:28:14.854 --> 01:28:16.323
No.

01:28:18.057 --> 01:28:20.728
No! No! No!

01:28:20.761 --> 01:28:24.031
We just want to try to do this
test with everyone the same.

01:28:24.064 --> 01:28:25.533
Okay. Right. You know,
with all the kids...

01:28:25.565 --> 01:28:27.635
But every child
is not the same.

01:28:27.667 --> 01:28:28.969
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- She's...

01:28:29.002 --> 01:28:30.738
Hey, wait, could you just...

01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:32.539
- Can you give us one moment?
- What do you mean?

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:33.908
Just give me one...
One second, please.

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.443
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay. Glory. Glory.

01:28:39.613 --> 01:28:41.382
What... What exactly
are you doing?

01:28:41.414 --> 01:28:43.417
Kay, I'm helping.

01:28:43.449 --> 01:28:45.385
- You're helping?
- Yeah.

01:28:45.418 --> 01:28:48.788
Right, like you've been doing
in my house with my daughter!

01:28:48.822 --> 01:28:50.423
- With my son!
- Listen.

01:28:50.457 --> 01:28:51.959
- I know...
- No, you don't!

01:28:51.992 --> 01:28:54.895
No, you don't!
You have no idea!

01:28:54.927 --> 01:28:57.398
Everything you told me
was a lie!

01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:59.065
It wasn't all a lie. I swear.

01:28:59.099 --> 01:29:01.569
Just... Just the part that
got me hired. Just that part.

01:29:01.601 --> 01:29:03.804
Okay.
Just that part?

01:29:03.837 --> 01:29:05.139
And I'm turning myself in right
after this, but please...

01:29:05.171 --> 01:29:06.773
My God.

01:29:06.806 --> 01:29:08.542
And I'll get
my GED in jail.

01:29:11.511 --> 01:29:14.514
You don't just tell little fibs,
your lies are extraordinary!

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:17.952
Why should I believe
anything you tell me?

01:29:20.487 --> 01:29:22.523
Because the cops
are here for me.

01:29:22.555 --> 01:29:23.523
Right.

01:29:26.059 --> 01:29:28.563
But first, will you please
just let me try this?

01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:45.613
Hi, I'm Jack. Glory's companion.
Look, she...

01:29:45.645 --> 01:29:47.514
I just have some things
in the bag for her, so...

01:29:47.547 --> 01:29:48.615
- Yeah.
- Is that okay?

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:49.784
- I think that's okay.
- Yeah, sure.

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:52.420
All right.
Hey, Glory.

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.489
Hey, girlie.
How's it going?

01:29:55.922 --> 01:29:58.525
Hey. You missed me?

01:30:03.095 --> 01:30:04.097
Hey.

01:30:05.765 --> 01:30:07.434
- Glory.
- No! No!

01:30:07.467 --> 01:30:09.036
- See?
- Glory. Glory.

01:30:09.069 --> 01:30:10.838
Hey. It's okay.

01:30:10.871 --> 01:30:13.807
Glory. Sit. Sit.

01:30:13.841 --> 01:30:16.110
Stay, Glory. Just stay.

01:30:16.143 --> 01:30:19.012
Glory, look what
I got for you.

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:21.615
Look, it's Hippo.
Hey, Hippo.

01:30:21.648 --> 01:30:24.185
Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:24.217 --> 01:30:26.987
All right, okay, let's
get you some headphones.

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.589
Here you go.

01:30:28.622 --> 01:30:30.990
We got princess
glasses, right?

01:30:31.024 --> 01:30:32.193
Yeah, that's good.

01:30:33.193 --> 01:30:35.930
Up. Up, Glory. Up.

01:30:35.962 --> 01:30:37.230
Good girl.

01:30:37.264 --> 01:30:40.067
Up. Up.

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:43.003
Good girl. -What are you
hoping to do with this?

01:30:43.036 --> 01:30:46.841
Being up high, it helps her
like sensory gratiation issues.

01:30:46.873 --> 01:30:48.141
Makes her smarter.

01:30:48.175 --> 01:30:51.177
You mean sensory
integration issues?

01:30:51.211 --> 01:30:54.014
Yeah.
That's what I said.

01:30:54.046 --> 01:30:58.585
Yeah. Actually, the Miller Method out
of Boston helps with comprehension.

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.490
Glory. Glory, sit.

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:04.926
Sit, Glory. Sit.

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:08.796
Good girl.
Good job. Okay.

01:31:08.828 --> 01:31:10.997
Now, give red
to the lady.

01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:13.132
Give red to that lady.

01:31:13.166 --> 01:31:16.103
Give a red block
to that lady.

01:31:16.136 --> 01:31:17.638
All right?

01:31:18.204 --> 01:31:19.506
Red.

01:31:21.908 --> 01:31:23.844
Yeah.

01:31:23.877 --> 01:31:26.747
The signs you're using,
they're not ASL.

01:31:26.779 --> 01:31:31.585
No. I, I just picked them
up working with, K-9 units.

01:31:31.618 --> 01:31:34.788
Actually, it was just,
it was just one guard dog.

01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:36.189
The rest of the signs I...

01:31:36.222 --> 01:31:37.591
I just made up.

01:31:41.094 --> 01:31:42.596
You know,
I'd like to try something.

01:31:45.332 --> 01:31:46.667
What color are these?

01:31:48.935 --> 01:31:50.770
Shoes.

01:31:50.804 --> 01:31:52.672
What color are the shoes?

01:31:52.706 --> 01:31:54.542
What color
are the shoes, Glory?

01:31:58.779 --> 01:32:00.114
Red!

01:32:00.146 --> 01:32:01.916
Good job, girlie.

01:32:01.948 --> 01:32:03.817
Red! Red! -They are red shoes.
They're red shoes.

01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:06.621
Now, can you put
the bear's shoes on?

01:32:13.659 --> 01:32:15.296
No.

01:32:15.328 --> 01:32:18.965
No. Put the shoes
on the bear, Glory.

01:32:18.998 --> 01:32:21.001
The bear. Yeah.
Shoes on the bear.

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:24.338
- Yeah.
- That's right.

01:32:24.371 --> 01:32:26.007
- Yeah. Good job.
- One shoe on.

01:32:27.673 --> 01:32:29.277
That's two shoes on.
Great job!

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.882
- Squishy!
- My God.

01:32:34.914 --> 01:32:36.817
- Squishy!
- Yeah!

01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:38.052
Squishy! Squishy!

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:39.286
We do that at home.

01:32:39.319 --> 01:32:40.621
- With her.
- Roll her up.

01:32:40.654 --> 01:32:42.990
She loves it.

01:32:43.023 --> 01:32:45.826
- Pretend to play. That's good.
- Squishy.

01:32:45.859 --> 01:32:48.629
Does the bear
have a name, Glory?

01:32:48.662 --> 01:32:51.798
Actually, she's... She's
really good at her numbers.

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:54.001
So, yeah,
we'll work on her numbers.

01:32:54.033 --> 01:32:55.969
Glory, get your
cards out, okay?

01:32:56.002 --> 01:32:58.038
Can you find your cards?
Find your cards.

01:32:59.171 --> 01:33:01.007
Good girl.

01:33:01.041 --> 01:33:03.844
Glory, what
number is that?

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:07.748
Seven.

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.817
That's right.
That is a seven.

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:12.319
Look what I got.
I got jelly beans. No.

01:33:12.351 --> 01:33:16.923
Okay, I want you to give
a jelly bean to that lady.

01:33:16.957 --> 01:33:19.927
That lady. Tutti frutti
to that lady. Right there.

01:33:30.936 --> 01:33:33.172
Thank you, Glory.
Thank you.

01:33:33.206 --> 01:33:35.842
Tutti frutti

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:39.980
I want jelly belly
jelly bean please.

01:33:40.012 --> 01:33:43.951
Okay, all right.
Just, ask the lady.

01:33:43.984 --> 01:33:46.020
Can you ask the lady?
Ask the lady.

01:33:54.728 --> 01:33:59.867
May I have a jelly belly
jelly bean please?

01:33:59.899 --> 01:34:01.434
- Yeah.
- Yes you may, Glory.

01:34:01.467 --> 01:34:03.436
Nice asking.

01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:05.706
- That's nice asking.
- Very nice.

01:34:11.411 --> 01:34:12.779
My favorite!

01:34:18.385 --> 01:34:20.887
So Kay and Mark, it was
nice meeting you. -Same.

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:23.423
We'll let you know
either way.

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:27.427
And I'm really confident that you
have a wonderful support system.

01:34:29.362 --> 01:34:31.364
- So...
- No. Wait.

01:34:31.398 --> 01:34:34.301
You gotta to know, there
is no support system here.

01:34:34.333 --> 01:34:36.302
I can't stay.

01:34:36.336 --> 01:34:37.838
I can't help anymore.

01:34:38.971 --> 01:34:40.306
And...

01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:41.676
But I did help...

01:34:43.777 --> 01:34:44.744
Right?

01:34:46.345 --> 01:34:49.315
It's... It's true...

01:34:49.349 --> 01:34:51.318
Glory is losing her
one on one, and...

01:34:52.385 --> 01:34:53.421
They...

01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:57.458
They... They made strides.

01:35:01.927 --> 01:35:06.466
She can be a lot more than she
is if you give her a chance.

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.502
If Glory isn't enrolled
in your school this fall,

01:35:09.536 --> 01:35:11.171
do you wanna be wondering
a year from now

01:35:11.203 --> 01:35:12.806
what happened
to this little girl?

01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.844
Don't you wanna make
a difference in her life?

01:35:18.011 --> 01:35:18.946
Yes, I do.

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:25.485
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be rude...

01:35:26.485 --> 01:35:27.387
Is that a "yes"?

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:31.726
We're going to do
everything we can.

01:35:32.292 --> 01:35:34.128
We really are.

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:36.363
We're going to do
everything we can for you.

01:35:36.395 --> 01:35:37.018
Thank you so much.

01:35:37.019 --> 01:35:38.264
Thank you very much.
Really, thank you.

01:35:38.297 --> 01:35:40.501
- We... We really appreciate that.
- Yeah, we do.

01:35:40.533 --> 01:35:41.902
- It means a lot to us.
- Yeah.

01:35:45.939 --> 01:35:48.476
It looks good. They loved her.
It looks good.

01:35:49.509 --> 01:35:51.177
Easy peasy, right, girlie?

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.750
Can I have a minute?

01:36:00.319 --> 01:36:03.023
So, "Hi Jack,"

01:36:06.493 --> 01:36:08.162
I guess she knew
more than all of us.

01:36:11.163 --> 01:36:13.533
I... I did like you.

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:16.302
That part wasn't a lie.

01:36:18.872 --> 01:36:21.542
Hey, maybe you can, help me out
with my homework sometime?

01:36:23.342 --> 01:36:24.444
Yeah, maybe.

01:36:26.011 --> 01:36:27.280
All right, let's go.

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:28.849
Can you give us
a moment, please?

01:36:30.317 --> 01:36:32.252
I'm really sorry
I lied...

01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.355
Hey.

01:36:35.387 --> 01:36:37.291
Hey, what do
you want, Glory?

01:36:39.391 --> 01:36:40.560
What do you want?

01:36:42.028 --> 01:36:43.030
Say it.

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:45.032
Say it.

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:47.568
Stay.

01:36:52.137 --> 01:36:53.474
You did it, girlie.

01:36:54.506 --> 01:36:55.408
Yeah.

01:36:56.309 --> 01:36:58.244
I can't stay. I'm sorry.

01:37:07.253 --> 01:37:08.389
Thank you.

01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:13.894
Be good.

01:37:13.926 --> 01:37:16.996
We're gonna help you.
It's gonna be okay. -Okay.

01:37:20.132 --> 01:37:22.435
All right,
Miss Jacquelyn.

01:37:22.469 --> 01:37:26.907
We'll take you down to the station
and I'll meet you there later.

01:37:26.939 --> 01:37:30.543
They help you out like she said and
you'll see your sister soon enough.

01:37:30.577 --> 01:37:32.213
You take care
of this one.
