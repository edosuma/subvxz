00:10.160 --> 00:13.120
Nueva Mañana newspaper
thanks you all for coming.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.360
The Amanecer Awards,
recognizing this year's

00:16.520 --> 00:19.320
most outstanding citizens,
will begin shortly.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.200
You could have at least
worn a suit.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.520
You could have
brought your wife.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.920
If I'm screwed,
so are you.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.000
I bet if we made these guys
empty their pockets,

00:41.160 --> 00:44.800
we'd find more narcotics
than in a cartel warehouse.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.080
I'm starting to regret
calling you.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.160
Why are we here?
I'm here under duress.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.520
For the PR department.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.080
-And me?
-How's the case going?

00:55.080 --> 00:58.040
The same as when you asked me
a half hour ago.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.680
-What's your issue with Isabel?
-That's why I'm here?

01:00.840 --> 01:03.200
To see if a change of scene
would help you open up.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.040
It's nothing
you can't solve.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.280
Put her with
someone else, period.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.280
Look, I'm not interested
in your private life.

01:11.960 --> 01:15.000
When you requested a partner,
did I ask any questions?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.120
You were
the perfect team together.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.960
You asked
to change districts.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.120
What the hell happened?

01:21.320 --> 01:24.080
Don't meddle
in my private life, okay?

01:25.880 --> 01:27.840
-Your life's a mess.
-And yours...?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.920
-It's not so bad.
-Screwing the accountant.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.200
-That was a mistake.
-Right.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.080
Don't demand any explanations
unless I do.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.880
Don't pretend you're an example
to follow.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.760
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:44.920 --> 01:48.080
Go socialize
and make some friends.

01:48.080 --> 01:48.160
Go socialize
and make some friends.
It'd do you good.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.240
It'd do you good.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.480
I didn't do anything to you.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.080
That bastard.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.920
-Hey.
-Hello.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.360
I could arrest you
for harassment.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.160
I'm in a public place.
How would you prove it?

03:49.160 --> 03:52.280
-You sure know the law.
-It's no surprise, honey.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.640
I'd hear you reciting
when you studied for exams.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.040
For instance, I know exactly
how many pieces there are

04:00.080 --> 04:01.840
in all the different firearms.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.480
Useful for a mom.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.120
-You should have come up.
-I'm fine here.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.160
I have to get to work.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.040
I'll walk with you,
you can endure me a bit longer.

04:17.040 --> 04:17.080
I'll walk with you,
you can endure me a bit longer.
It won't be long,
it's right here.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.640
It won't be long,
it's right here.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.440
-So?
-So what?

04:21.600 --> 04:22.680
Any news?

04:27.880 --> 04:29.040
Isabel, what's wrong?

04:30.360 --> 04:31.360
Where's my car?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.480
I parked it here.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.320
-Well, hang on...
-No, Mom, no.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
I'm certain.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.880
I left it here.
I parked it here!

04:42.080 --> 04:43.080
Wait a minute.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.440
Did you misplace it
like the gift?

04:46.600 --> 04:47.600
Excuse me?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.160
What are you saying?

04:51.200 --> 04:52.600
That I can't remember things?

04:53.360 --> 04:55.680
That I'm unstable
and losing it?

04:56.080 --> 04:58.960
-Or whatever the hell you say.
-I didn't say that.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.000
Goddamnit...

05:41.480 --> 05:43.080
I thought it wouldn't hurt.

05:43.080 --> 05:43.160
I thought it wouldn't hurt.
They don't come out easily.
Shall I continue?

05:43.160 --> 05:46.240
They don't come out easily.
Shall I continue?

05:48.560 --> 05:50.320
I hope it doesn't leave
a bald spot.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.600
Although it's nothing compared
to what might have happened.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.560
You were lucky.
Have they caught the guy?

05:57.720 --> 05:59.960
Right, like they'll catch him.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.040
I'm a strong woman.
I always have been.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.640
And now I look behind me
when I'm alone in the street.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.640
The prick did more than give me
a scar and 17 sutures.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.400
He terrified me.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.760
I've bought a ton
of pepper spray online.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.120
-You can have one if you like.
-No, thanks.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.320
Here, take one.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.400
Careful where you point it,
watch your eyes.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.920
I've cared for
countless victims here.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.920
It's horrible to see them.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.520
I often wonder
how they managed to start anew.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.040
-If they've recovered.
-That would be a good feature.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.800
Actually, it'd be brilliant.
How life goes on afterwards.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.560
Hey, how...?

06:50.040 --> 06:52.040
How can I get in touch
with these women?

06:52.560 --> 06:54.040
That's confidential.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.000
Sure, I understand.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.440
But this would be a positive
report to help people.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.160
A way of showing
there is hope afterwards.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.960
A few women who'd like
to share their stories.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.120
Anonymously, of course.
I'm a diligent reporter.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.200
If we don't
help each other out, Carmen...

07:15.360 --> 07:16.680
I can't.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.640
-Thanks.
-No problem.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.400
I need you to sign
the medical insurance slip.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.960
I'm ashamed to ask but...

07:31.160 --> 07:32.720
Could I get an autograph?

07:33.040 --> 07:35.080
-I'm a huge fan.
-Of course, sweetie.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.200
Did you say you work
in administration?

07:37.400 --> 07:39.960
What stress, right?
All that paperwork...

07:40.120 --> 07:43.040
-But my passion is TV, really.
-Get out of town!

07:44.080 --> 07:47.080
-Want to chat over coffee?
-Sure thing.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.960
-Thanks.
-I'll be right out.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.000
I hope that
far-off look means

08:01.200 --> 08:03.080
you're thinking
about our killer.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.960
-How long have you been here?
-Since 4:45am.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.720
-I'll file the overtime.
-Good. Come to any conclusions?

08:09.920 --> 08:13.000
Our killer knows
exactly what to do.

08:13.000 --> 08:13.040
Our killer knows
exactly what to do.
It's all these
goddamn TV shows.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.960
It's all these
goddamn TV shows.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.680
They give them
all they need to know

08:16.800 --> 08:18.080
in the interest
of entertainment.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.000
I doubt he saw this on TV.

08:20.000 --> 08:20.040
I doubt he saw this on TV.
His actions reflect experience
and organization.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.840
His actions reflect experience
and organization.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.360
He knows how we work.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.280
-No way.
-It's possible.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.400
-It can't be a cop.
-We're amongst some

08:30.560 --> 08:33.840
-of the angriest at the ruling.
-You're a prime example.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
Hello?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.440
-There's been another one.
-Excuse me?

08:41.800 --> 08:43.960
-We're on it.
-Isabel, where were you?

08:44.120 --> 08:47.040
Out.
I've got a report to file.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.880
-My car's been stolen.
-What?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.200
I don't know, bad luck, I guess.

08:51.320 --> 08:54.040
I parked it last night
and this morning it was gone.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.040
-They just found your car.
-Already?

08:58.040 --> 09:00.560
It was parked 100 meters
from where you said.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.000
Where on earth is your head at?

09:03.160 --> 09:04.240
How can you
do your job

09:04.400 --> 09:05.880
if you don't know
where you parked?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.640
-Where's the latest body?
-On a construction site.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.160
-Looks like the monkey.
-You know what to do.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.240
-Remember your job duties?
-Yes.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
Perea.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.200
-What's up? Are you sick?
-What?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.680
No, it's just a headache.
Come on.

09:36.120 --> 09:39.040
It's considered
a potentially dangerous breed

09:39.040 --> 09:39.080
It's considered
a potentially dangerous breed
but it's also a fantastic
guard dog.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.040
but it's also a fantastic
guard dog.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.080
Her bite exerts between 660
and 770 pounds of pressure.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.800
If she gets you,
she won't let go.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.040
Her name is Paqui.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.040
It doesn't exactly suit her.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.000
You look after me...
and I'll look after you.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.920
That's quite a bruise.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.600
-I'll see if I can hide it.
-Don't even think about it.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.720
In fact, make it stand out.
I want it to be seen.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.400
It'll make the police look bad.
They're useless.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.120
Go ahead.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.200
Someone just left you this.
A woman, she wouldn't come in.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.120
-Okay. Thanks.
-No problem.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.280
God, it's impossible.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.480
-We're on in 15 minutes.
-Coming.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.040
-What's up, Abaño?
-He's through the back.

11:26.040 --> 11:26.080
-What's up, Abaño?
-He's through the back.
What have we got?

11:26.080 --> 11:27.280
What have we got?

11:44.280 --> 11:47.640
He got out a week ago.
Strangled, like the last one.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.200
-What's today's story?
-He burgled luxury homes.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.040
He strangled a developer
trying to make him open a safe.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.720
"Time served".

12:02.480 --> 12:03.560
Another card.

12:04.520 --> 12:08.000
Well... it seems
we've hit a dead-end.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.240
Let's see if Forensics
has any luck.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.680
Why are you
taking tranquilizers?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.120
Stay out of my life.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.640
You'd never take this stuff.
You have nerves of steel.

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
Leave me alone.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.040
Not much, but Forensics
should find something.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.040
What's up with her?

13:00.800 --> 13:01.920
Here's today's stuff.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.080
If you need to talk to me,
use this cellphone.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.200
Call the number saved in here,
not mine.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.960
No.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.560
It'd be a mistake.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.440
Hold up.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.280
Why?

13:57.200 --> 13:58.200
I'm starving.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.840
Goddammit.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.080
What's this?

14:36.560 --> 14:39.760
-Why do you care?
-Why is my partner's name on it?

14:42.080 --> 14:44.680
I don't know.
It's a list of rape victims.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.400
But what...? Who...?

14:47.840 --> 14:49.360
I don't know, no idea.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.800
A source got it for me.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.160
Put me on to Ramón Díaz
in Legal Archives.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.640
It's Nieto. I need the verdict
of a rape case. It's urgent.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.560
No, I need it now.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.680
Isabel Mora. Who did it?

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
Open up.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.200
-Is Juan in?
-Go on through.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.320
I don't know
what today's lineup is,

16:12.480 --> 16:13.760
but it can wait.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.160
Can I help you?

17:04.160 --> 17:05.520
You son of a...

17:09.320 --> 17:11.360
So, you like
raping women, do you?

17:55.280 --> 17:56.280
How's it going?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.200
What are those circles?

18:01.840 --> 18:03.720
Addresses of the
victims' families.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.120
I'm marking ones
where men live....

18:06.720 --> 18:09.160
men strong enough to kill,
based on their age and build.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.160
Look this over.
And have someone track them.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.240
Okay.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.440
The Ex-con Killer
has struck again.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.560
The victim was
a 46-year-old male

18:20.720 --> 18:23.280
with the initials R.M.B.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.520
He was found strangled
at a construction site.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.160
Nobody knows who's hiding
behind the monkey mask,

18:29.320 --> 18:33.120
while fear and neurosis starts
to spread among inmates.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.920
And now, a real scoop.

18:36.680 --> 18:40.920
Our network has received
first-hand knowledge...

18:42.440 --> 18:45.520
Officer Isabel Mora
was raped when she was young

18:45.680 --> 18:47.960
by the aristocrat
Julián López de Haro.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.520
Isabel Mora has hidden

18:50.680 --> 18:52.760
her awful experience
all this time.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.760
Not even
her most trusted colleagues

18:54.920 --> 18:57.000
knew of her painful past.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.560
Yes, good evening.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.280
I'm calling from
51, Ginzo de Limia Street.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
Three B.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.320
My power's out.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.920
What do you mean?

20:26.120 --> 20:27.600
Why have you cut it off?

20:29.320 --> 20:30.320
What letter?

20:30.960 --> 20:34.080
No... No, I didn't get
any letter!

21:03.160 --> 21:04.400
Come on, pick up.

21:55.800 --> 21:59.080
-Andrea, do you want some pizza?
-No. I'm heading home.

21:59.080 --> 21:59.120
-Andrea, do you want some pizza?
-No. I'm heading home.
I imagine... someone's waiting
for you to have dinner.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.680
I imagine... someone's waiting
for you to have dinner.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.160
No, actually.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.080
Do you live alone?

22:09.920 --> 22:11.120
I don't like pizza.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.560
Right. Sure.
You don't want to talk...

22:15.040 --> 22:17.560
I'm the one who does
all the talking, right?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.960
-I'm going.
-If it weren't...

22:22.080 --> 22:24.960
Without you, I wouldn't
have lasted in prison.

22:25.120 --> 22:30.000
Our conversations helped
ease my pain a little.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.400
Two years of talking...

22:34.080 --> 22:37.280
and you know everything about me
but I know nothing about you.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.360
You don't need to.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.480
I've told you things
I've never told anyone else...

22:45.000 --> 22:48.040
-and I only trust you.
-You don't have much choice.

22:53.760 --> 22:58.120
Are you this cold...
with all your patients?

23:01.680 --> 23:05.640
-It isn't the same.
-What do you mean?

23:07.160 --> 23:08.480
In this relationship...

23:09.120 --> 23:12.200
-you're fully dependent on me.
-Is that right?

23:16.080 --> 23:18.880
Aren't I the one
who's helping you?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.040
It's been revealed today
that Isabel Mora,

23:23.200 --> 23:25.000
one of the agents
leading the case,

23:25.120 --> 23:26.840
was raped by one
of the ex-cons

23:27.000 --> 23:28.320
when she was
a young girl.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.040
The Altamira Cave
is being reopened...

23:32.080 --> 23:33.240
I have to...

23:35.560 --> 23:36.760
I have...

23:46.560 --> 23:48.160
I had a bite to eat tonight.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.760
Why are you here?
Who gave you Isabel's address?

23:53.240 --> 23:54.640
I'm doing my job, okay?

23:54.840 --> 23:57.280
-How could you stir all this up?
-Why wouldn't I?

23:57.480 --> 24:00.080
-It's in the public's interest?
-Public interest?

24:00.240 --> 24:02.960
You'd sell your mother
for ratings.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.520
Who the hell
do you think you are?

24:04.640 --> 24:07.400
You can't talk to me like this
just because we have sex.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.640
And you have the right
to screw up someone's life?

24:10.120 --> 24:13.360
Knowing if that police officer
is fit to do her damn job

24:13.480 --> 24:15.040
is in the public's interest.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.120
Maybe it's why
you're getting nowhere.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.960
So you're doing it to help.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.680
Just what we need,
help from the damn press.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.640
What the hell are you doing?
-What the...!

24:24.840 --> 24:27.800
-Shut off the damn camera!
-Javi, he's a cop!

24:27.960 --> 24:29.440
-Stop filming Isabel!
-Javi, stop!

24:29.640 --> 24:32.520
-Give me the damn camera!
-Do you know what that's worth?

24:32.680 --> 24:35.320
What's going on, Nieto?
Why are their reporters here?

25:33.200 --> 25:35.800
-What's wrong?
-You're telling the whole story!

25:36.320 --> 25:37.400
It's all there!

25:38.000 --> 25:39.520
Everything he did to me!

25:39.960 --> 25:42.840
After all I've been through!
My humiliation!

25:43.480 --> 25:45.400
The shame, the guilt.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.320
That I don't want to live.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.520
-You're writing it all down!
-Calm down, Isabel. I just...

25:51.640 --> 25:55.120
I just want to understand
how your case develops.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.680
I'm not your patient!

25:56.880 --> 25:58.120
I'm your daughter!

25:58.720 --> 26:00.320
-Nothing happened!
-Listen to me.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.960
-Nothing happened to me!
-Isabel, listen.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.280
-Listen to me!
-No!

26:04.480 --> 26:05.720
Listen!

26:06.080 --> 26:08.080
You ignore what happened.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.680
-You were raped.
-No.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.000
That will stay with you
for the rest of your life.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.120
No.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.600
Mom? Mom.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.280
Mom.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.400
I didn't know you'd been...

26:27.560 --> 26:30.080
-It's horrible, I'm sorry.
-No, I'm fine.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.960
I'm okay.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.240
It's important you don't worry.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.640
Just carry on with your life.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.800
How am I going to do that?
Mom, you're everywhere.

26:41.440 --> 26:45.800
-There are camera crews!
-It'll pass. I'm trending now!

26:45.960 --> 26:47.600
It'll be
something else tomorrow.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.120
Don't protect me.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.440
I had to hear what happened
from someone else.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.160
As if I didn't exist,
like I'm not part of you.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.600
-It wouldn't have helped...
-How do you know?

26:58.240 --> 27:00.640
It might have helped me
understand my life.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.760
The control, the obsessions,
making me cover up...

27:03.960 --> 27:05.320
Mom, I'm a freak.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.440
I am.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.720
I'm 16
and I've never kissed a boy.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.520
You projected your fears
onto me.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.040
Thank you.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.000
Sol.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.760
-Where are you going?
-To meet some friends.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.040
Hi.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.680
You here for another round?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.640
Don't get all defensive.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.440
It's a mechanism
to stop you from falling apart.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.040
-Right.
-But don't use it on me.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.160
I don't want this.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.120
I know why you're here,
the answer is no.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.200
You have to quit the case.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.560
What were you thinking?

28:17.040 --> 28:20.040
You're looking
for the Ex-con Killer,

28:20.760 --> 28:23.120
the one who could kill
the man who destroyed you.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.760
Don't you want him dead?

28:31.800 --> 28:34.120
-Answer me.
-I'm a police officer.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.480
What kind of answer is that?

28:40.400 --> 28:45.040
It gets me up in the morning.
I want to do what's right.

28:48.280 --> 28:51.600
Doing something nonsensical
isn't doing what's right.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.280
You don't need
to be the one to protect him.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.120
Yes, I do.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.000
It makes me better than him.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.560
You think I don't want him dead?

29:02.520 --> 29:05.240
That I don't hope it's him
every time there's a new victim?

29:06.160 --> 29:07.400
But I have to be stronger.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.160
The law has granted him freedom.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.160
I believe in the law.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.880
Yes, I get it. As I said...

29:22.960 --> 29:24.000
Yes.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.320
Yes, of course.
Understandable. I get it.

29:30.320 --> 29:32.840
Yes, but... Yes, okay then.

29:33.760 --> 29:34.960
Right, yes.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.960
Alright then. Thanks very much.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.440
Goddammit. I'm such
a kiss-up recently.

29:42.600 --> 29:46.120
-We have a problem.
-Really? Figure it out.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.000
Someone's here
to report an officer.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.160
My name is Julián López de Haro.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.040
I know full well who you are.
What do you want?

30:03.040 --> 30:05.360
One of the cops
from this precinct beat me up.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.480
-Sorry?
-And he killed my dog.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.520
He shot her.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.800
That's not possible.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.120
I can personally vouch
for each of my men.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.120
I can assure you

30:14.320 --> 30:16.280
-none of them is capable...
-It was me.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.360
In my office.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.200
Now.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.960
Take a statement from him.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.080
I hope you have time
to hear all I have to say,

30:45.080 --> 30:45.160
I hope you have time
to hear all I have to say,
-it wasn't pretty.
-Follow me, please.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.200
-it wasn't pretty.
-Follow me, please.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.960
-The dog bleeding out...
-If you would.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.840
-Terribly sad.
-Come on.

31:02.200 --> 31:05.000
What the hell was going
through your mind?

31:05.640 --> 31:09.040
-You're a public servant!
-I know. I know full well.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.080
I can't justify it.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.120
Is there any way
you might get him to drop it?

31:19.280 --> 31:20.360
No chance.

31:20.560 --> 31:23.800
If I had the chance again,
I'd finish what I started.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.840
That's the spirit,
always willing to help.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.320
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.240
Like hell you're leaving me
with this mess.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.040
-Pick up your badge.
-I can't be objective.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.360
I'll settle for you
just obeying orders.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.240
Now find yourself a costume,
you're going to Carnival.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.880
Get this,
one of the ex-cons works

31:48.000 --> 31:50.040
for the City Council's
cleaning service.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.480
Tonight he's got a shift
at a costume party.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.280
-Damn.
-Damn is right. Hey...

31:57.000 --> 31:58.040
Have you heard from her?

32:00.680 --> 32:02.080
Right. Well...

32:02.800 --> 32:05.640
Back to it.
We can't alert the public.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.640
No damn police presence.
They made that abundantly clear.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.160
I've swallowed more trash
than a garbage disposal.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.160
Understood.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.320
I'll be
the street cleaner's shadow.

32:18.960 --> 32:21.480
As for blending in,
you won't get me in a costume.

32:21.600 --> 32:25.040
Wear whatever you like.
Just don't go as a monkey.

32:38.720 --> 32:43.000
POLICE STATION

33:42.040 --> 33:43.280
What a coincidence.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.040
We need one
of those ticket dispensers

34:08.160 --> 34:11.040
-to avoid a queue forming.
-Damn, you startled me.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.680
Isabel.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.560
You're off the case.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.480
It's a decision I have to make.
I'm very sorry.

34:25.640 --> 34:28.040
No...
You can't be freaking serious.

34:29.520 --> 34:30.680
No!

34:53.120 --> 34:55.000
Don't make me a victim,
I'm a cop.

34:56.800 --> 35:01.040
All my colleagues pity me.
They've forgotten who I am.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.000
If you don't put
your faith in me,

35:04.360 --> 35:07.600
I'll always be the poor
16-year-old girl who got raped.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.040
I just want to work.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.680
I just want to be normal.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.720
Isabel, you're not normal.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.440
You have more balls than anyone.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.760
Can I stay on the case?

35:43.840 --> 35:46.760
-Where's Nieto?
-I hope he's doing his job,

35:46.880 --> 35:49.800
not getting reported again,
he's in pretty hot water.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.320
Reported? What did he do?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.680
The target is in my sight.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.960
-What's your position?
-No developments.

36:39.120 --> 36:41.080
-Everything in order.
-I want a balloon.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.720
-I want a balloon.
-Get lost, kid.

36:43.880 --> 36:46.720
-I want a balloon.
-Where are your parents?

36:46.920 --> 36:48.320
-Go find your parents.
-What's up?

36:48.520 --> 36:51.000
Go find them.
Someone wants to buy a balloon.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.080
I lost him, Abaño.

37:30.080 --> 37:33.160
-I lost him.
-What do you mean? Goddammit.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.040
I can't see him, Nieto.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.080
Freeze!

38:57.400 --> 38:59.160
-Are you alright?
-Yes.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.920
Stop!

39:01.120 --> 39:02.600
Police, freeze!

39:03.200 --> 39:04.200
Stop!

39:05.760 --> 39:07.720
Stop that man! Stop!

39:11.160 --> 39:12.400
Freeze!

39:13.640 --> 39:15.760
Police! Don't move!

39:19.080 --> 39:21.160
-I didn't do anything.
-Goddamn it!

42:31.360 --> 42:33.680
-Nobody move!
-Don't move.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.880
-Take it easy.
-You screwed me,

42:36.080 --> 42:37.920
-now I'm going to screw you.
-Easy.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.000
-Relax. Drop the weapon.
-Easy.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.560
You're dead, bastard.

42:42.640 --> 42:43.640
Take it easy.

42:46.240 --> 42:47.840
Put the gun down.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.280
Stop! Don't move!

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Stop! Don't move!

43:00.120 --> 43:02.800
Stay right there!
Don't move, easy does it.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.160
Go ahead.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Are you okay?

43:12.160 --> 43:13.160
-Yes.
-Sure?

43:16.920 --> 43:17.920
Who are you?

43:19.240 --> 43:20.240
Isabel Mora.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.440
Officer Mora. I'm new.

43:23.240 --> 43:26.680
-The gun could have gone off.
-I weighed up the probability.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.120
You have to be careful
improvising in this job.

43:31.680 --> 43:33.840
-Go get your nose cleaned up.
-I'm fine.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.080
Hey.

44:06.320 --> 44:07.680
Is this a good time?

44:11.280 --> 44:12.280
Come in.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.440
What a mess you have here.

44:34.840 --> 44:38.040
I think of it as an incomplete
collage of good intentions.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.080
-How poetic.
-That's me.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.520
Always keeping positive.
Would you like a drink?

44:45.640 --> 44:47.400
No. No.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.160
I just came to say thank you.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.920
-I heard you got reported.
-I should have killed him.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.000
-I don't know why I didn't.
-It's my problem.

44:57.160 --> 44:59.400
Right. So, you won't
talk to me about this.

44:59.520 --> 45:02.200
More? No, thanks.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.480
If you want details,
I'm all over the papers.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.000
What are you doing?

45:15.840 --> 45:17.120
Making use of my time.

45:20.480 --> 45:23.400
What do you want?
To dig up the past?

45:25.080 --> 45:26.680
Drop the damn broom!

45:29.040 --> 45:30.680
Why didn't you tell me?

45:31.480 --> 45:32.920
I would've understood.

45:34.640 --> 45:35.720
Why does it matter?

45:36.680 --> 45:38.040
I felt like crap afterwards.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.120
I didn't know
what I'd done wrong.

45:41.720 --> 45:44.080
I thought I'd messed up
the only good thing I had.

45:50.800 --> 45:51.840
There we go then.

45:56.080 --> 45:57.120
All cleared up.

46:10.080 --> 46:11.280
I'll take out the trash.

46:43.920 --> 46:44.920
Right.

47:03.720 --> 47:04.920
This is ridiculous.

47:16.800 --> 47:17.840
Come in.

47:18.040 --> 47:19.840
I don't often say this...

47:20.520 --> 47:23.080
-But?
-You're nearly as good as me.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.160
I'm better than you.

47:26.040 --> 47:29.080
Yep. You'd never have solved
this case without me.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.680
Not to mention the others.

47:30.880 --> 47:33.000
What do you think I did
before you got here?

47:33.360 --> 47:36.800
You were just...
a run-of-the-mill cop.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.680
Happy reading tonight.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.040
Tomorrow, same as always?

48:41.960 --> 48:43.960
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

48:48.120 --> 48:50.480
-What are you doing?
-Don't touch me.

48:50.680 --> 48:52.040
What's wrong?

48:53.920 --> 48:55.400
Don't move.

48:57.960 --> 48:59.000
Don't move.

49:00.160 --> 49:01.840
-Take it easy.
-Don't move!
