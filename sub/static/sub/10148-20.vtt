WEBVTT

01:07.860 --> 01:10.529
They found that identical twins
who were raised apart,

01:10.613 --> 01:12.323
never even met each other,

01:12.406 --> 01:14.909
still grew up with uncanny similarities.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.369
Now, the study proved

01:16.452 --> 01:19.413
what a powerful influence
genetics has over us.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.958
- Max.
- But what about free will?

01:22.208 --> 01:24.019
I mean, I'm not gonna believe
that everything I am

01:24.043 --> 01:25.962
was completely decided
before I was born.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.131
Can we choose to disobey our own drives?

01:29.382 --> 01:31.259
This troubling question endures

01:31.342 --> 01:33.719
as researchers continue to discover

01:33.803 --> 01:36.514
the extent to which
human behavior is preordained

01:36.597 --> 01:39.892
by biologic
and environmental influences.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
I don't know.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.736
Has being Batman just given me
a suspicious nature?

01:50.820 --> 01:53.656
Yes, but there's still something weird
with Ms. Martel.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.295
Zeta. Going back to school?

02:10.131 --> 02:12.174
Remind me never to tick off
the phone company.

02:12.258 --> 02:14.051
Last chance to come home quietly.

02:24.437 --> 02:26.272
I'll call you
when I know what's going on.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.268
Where's your respect for teachers?

03:11.108 --> 03:12.108
What the...

03:27.583 --> 03:28.626
Ohh!

03:29.585 --> 03:32.630
Special Agent Bennet. NSA.
The synthoid is ours.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.298
Now, either help or get out of the way.

04:03.369 --> 04:04.829
Move it. Don't lose the signal.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.384
You're not cleared
for this information.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.636
But since it's loose
on my streets,

05:03.012 --> 05:05.681
you're going to be smart enough
to tell me what I'm dealing with.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.479
It's an advanced tactical synthoid,

05:11.562 --> 05:12.813
Infiltration Unit: Zeta.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.398
Designed for deep-cover ops.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.734
Replace, interrogate, dispose.

05:17.193 --> 05:18.433
You're not supposed to like it.

05:26.744 --> 05:27.995
High endurance endo-frame

05:28.078 --> 05:30.247
equipped with a full array
of weapons and tools.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.791
A holographic emitter onboard
conceals the rig

05:32.875 --> 05:34.919
while enabling Zeta
to mimic its targets.

05:36.921 --> 05:39.089
And this
you people release into a school.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.799
We didn't release it anywhere.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.677
It stopped following orders.
Ours, anyway.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.847
Zeta was on a long-term assignment
infiltrating a terrorist group.

05:47.223 --> 05:48.724
Six days ago, it went renegade.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.518
Why? How?

05:50.601 --> 05:51.601
We don't know.

05:51.936 --> 05:53.812
We think the terrorists
got to its programming.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.856
We have to assume it's obeying them now.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.608
And that means we take it out.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.527
In a school, on a street corner,

06:00.027 --> 06:01.070
wherever we get the shot.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.364
We'll cooperate however we can.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.371
You get all that?

06:13.374 --> 06:14.542
Guess I'm losing my touch.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.878
I don't like this Bennet
waging his war on my streets.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.422
I trust, if you find the synthoid first,

06:20.798 --> 06:22.925
you'll show more concern
about who else gets hurt.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.653
At least we know
it's out of the high school.

06:24.677 --> 06:25.886
Don't be so sure.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.514
If this thing
was at your school for a reason,

06:29.515 --> 06:30.683
<i>it might come back.</i>

06:50.703 --> 06:51.703
Hey, Max.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.334
Dana, what's up?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.854
Thought you might need a ride
to Winn's study group tonight.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.338
No, thanks. I'll see you there.

07:04.717 --> 07:05.902
You know where Winn lives, right?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.177
I'll get directions from her.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.221
Him.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.808
You said her. Winn's a guy.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.769
Sorry. Concentrating.

07:16.562 --> 07:17.605
What else is new?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.810
Help! In here! Somebody help me!

07:58.646 --> 08:00.689
Go ahead. No one can hear you.

08:00.773 --> 08:03.359
Now let's go over
everyone you know at school again.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.569
And this time, be more thorough.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.959
Hey, workaholic, let's get some chow.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.503
Genoa and Swiss. Your fave.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.588
Thanks, Terry, but I have a lot to do.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.715
- Maybe see you after school?
- You kidding?

08:27.132 --> 08:29.718
With what's been going on,
the night job's been full-time lately.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.928
In fact, I could use your help
covering with Dana.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.180
Sure. What does she need?

08:34.723 --> 08:36.684
Know what? I just remembered I'm free.

08:37.101 --> 08:38.394
I will see you after school.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.381
Signal's moving east.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.883
It's headed for the factory district.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.510
Get three scanner teams out there now.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.610
Come on. Open!

09:38.412 --> 09:39.788
Am I glad you're back.

09:39.872 --> 09:42.666
I couldn't live another second
without your charming repartee.

09:46.462 --> 09:48.380
I must remember to practice sarcasm.

09:52.926 --> 09:53.926
Here.

09:55.888 --> 09:56.930
You must be hungry.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.518
Genoa and Swiss.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.810
Your fave.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.527
Why so nice all of a sudden?

10:10.819 --> 10:12.196
It is not all of a sudden.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.448
I have taken great care
not to injure you.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.910
Being held hostage
isn't exactly five-star treatment.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.912
This detainment was necessary.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.371
Why? What are you after?

10:21.663 --> 10:22.663
My freedom.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.918
This filter will disrupt
my homing beacon.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.003
They will not be able to find me again.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.547
Those guys who are after you,
they built you?

10:30.839 --> 10:34.384
Yes. I was created
for one purpose, to destroy.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.845
I do not wish to destroy anymore.

10:36.929 --> 10:37.763
Prove it.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.389
If you don't wanna be a killer,

10:39.473 --> 10:41.099
then why carry around all those weapons?

10:41.391 --> 10:43.936
They will destroy me.
I must defend myself.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.980
Even if it means killing?
You're a smart guy.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.794
If you really don't wanna hurt anybody
you'll find another way.

11:18.637 --> 11:21.723
Now, isn't that a load off your chest?

11:24.601 --> 11:26.478
We'll work on your sense of humor, too.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.157
Run!

11:49.376 --> 11:50.376
No! Wait!

11:50.669 --> 11:52.045
Stop, both of you!

12:08.937 --> 12:10.522
- Come on.
- Hold it.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.816
You don't understand. Zeta's okay.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.526
What? Are you nuts?

12:14.902 --> 12:16.361
Just give him a chance to explain.

12:16.737 --> 12:17.821
It's a him now?

12:17.905 --> 12:20.365
I've seen this thing in action, Max.
It's a monster.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.854
No! Zeta, he'll be killed!

13:01.281 --> 13:02.281
You all right?

13:07.496 --> 13:08.747
Freeze, all of you.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.602
Zeta, no!

13:30.686 --> 13:31.686
Get down.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.153
I was programmed to maintain
the secrecy of my own existence.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.114
Anyone I replaced saw what I was

14:24.197 --> 14:25.365
and could never be set free.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.451
But you didn't wanna kill
this terrorist guy?

14:27.743 --> 14:28.994
He was not a terrorist.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.912
His associates were terrorists.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.331
- He was an accountant.
- So he was innocent?

14:33.623 --> 14:36.251
Yes, but that is not why I spared him.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.504
Replacing him
required that I live with his family.

14:39.755 --> 14:42.007
I watched them experience life.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.802
I saw his daughter
ride a bicycle for the first time.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.639
I could not deprive her father
of seeing her grow

14:49.931 --> 14:52.100
just because he knew I existed.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.268
Wow.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.351
So why the high school?

14:54.686 --> 14:56.772
I needed computers
and electronic equipment.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.025
Compared to a government site,
a school has little security.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.486
And once you saw
who's who at the school,

15:02.569 --> 15:04.196
I was the natural choice.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.782
Who'd look twice at me
spending all day at the lab?

15:07.199 --> 15:08.199
Ready to rock.

15:08.492 --> 15:09.534
That's what I'm afraid of.

15:09.618 --> 15:10.618
What?

15:12.454 --> 15:14.873
Look, I really hope
I'm wrong about this,

15:14.956 --> 15:16.458
but he's been programmed to kill.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.293
I'm not sure I can just let him go.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.711
Ter, you heard him.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.880
He doesn't wanna be violent anymore.

15:21.963 --> 15:22.963
No?

15:23.006 --> 15:25.217
Did you see him go for those lasers
back at the factory?

15:25.550 --> 15:27.052
Violence is hard-wired into him.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.095
It's what he is.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.347
He can fight that. I know he can.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.641
Max, he held you hostage.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.786
You wanna let him do that
to someone else?

15:34.810 --> 15:35.810
I'm sorry.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.354
It was my only choice.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.773
It's the only way I know
to acquire an identity.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.400
Well, we're gonna have to come up
with another way, aren't we?

15:42.484 --> 15:46.613
Does your memory still hold all those
people you, uh, "replaced" before?

15:46.696 --> 15:47.696
Yes.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.282
Well, then, why not mix them up?

15:49.366 --> 15:51.868
You know, one guy's hair,
another guy's eyes.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.287
That way,
you could decide who you wanna be.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.579
Mix them up.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.006
I should go.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.194
They'll have followed
my last signal to this area.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.218
Good luck, Zeta.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.899
I still need to keep an eye on him.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.651
At least till he's out of town.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.904
Just give him a chance, Ter.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.830
Still no signal. He lost us.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.498
We'll find him.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.084
He's not getting out of Gotham.

16:41.459 --> 16:45.255
<i>Now arriving on track two,
Monorail Eight from Center City.</i>

16:45.338 --> 16:46.631
<i>Please step away from the track.</i>

16:47.674 --> 16:50.010
<i>Passenger Ann French,
please meet your party...</i>

16:50.093 --> 16:51.761
<i>Rail station Six, check in.</i>

16:51.845 --> 16:53.138
Rail Six, all clear.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.807
<i>Please meet your party
at the east information kiosk.</i>

17:01.354 --> 17:04.774
<i>Now boarding on track four,
Monorail 18 bound for Dakota.</i>

17:05.859 --> 17:08.361
The radio said
the snow was at 4,000 feet.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.529
Isn't that kind of deep?

17:11.239 --> 17:13.158
Ugh! Ooh!

17:13.408 --> 17:14.408
I'm sorry. I wasn't...

17:15.869 --> 17:16.869
What?

17:17.787 --> 17:20.457
Target spotted.
Rail station Six, southwest sector.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.875
Freeze, tin man!

17:31.134 --> 17:32.134
Excuse me.

17:43.939 --> 17:44.939
He's in there.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.333
Aah!

18:32.153 --> 18:33.153
Come on out, Zeta.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.699
Nobody blames you.
You're malfunctioning.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.822
Let us take a look at you.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.577
We'll make you better again.
We'll fix your programming.

18:54.718 --> 18:55.844
Oh, Zeta, don't.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.523
I decide who I want to be.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.080
There it is. Fire!

19:43.892 --> 19:44.892
Get down there.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.019
Retrieve the synthoid.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.395
- Come on.
- Let's go.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.497
Around this way.

20:05.789 --> 20:06.789
He fell over here.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.714
What was that?

20:16.091 --> 20:17.425
I don't know. Self-destruct?

20:18.802 --> 20:20.512
Well, start digging.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.977
<i>Final boarding call,
Monorail 17, on track three.</i>
