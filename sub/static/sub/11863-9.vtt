02:23.111 --> 02:25.270
This for tomorrow?

02:25.993 --> 02:27.708
Uh, yeah, I'm sure.

02:28.913 --> 02:31.977
You know, that's my other line, so... ok.

02:31.997 --> 02:33.466
Ok, ok.

Ok, goodbye. [Hangs up phone]

Hello?

Woman: Oh, yeah, we can set up ourselves.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.154
How many chairs?

02:51.174 --> 02:53.254
Oh, great, great.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.096
Ok.

05:04.962 --> 05:06.720
They pushed my afternoon sessions

05:06.722 --> 05:08.251

05:08.271 --> 05:10.092
All you have to do is get the cake.

05:10.112 --> 05:12.726
Yeah, ok. Do you think he knows?

05:12.777 --> 05:13.728
No. Why?

05:13.748 --> 05:15.896
Jill, I'm waiting!

05:15.947 --> 05:17.153
Hey, when does Tommy get back?

05:17.173 --> 05:19.560
Said he had a morning class
and he'd come after that.

- All right.
- So I'll see you at noon.

05:21.462 --> 05:24.385

- The what?

05:24.832 --> 05:26.573
The breeder?

05:26.867 --> 05:29.279
- For the puppy?
- Oh. It has to be today?

05:29.299 --> 05:31.885
Yeah, we have to go today;
Otherwise we go on the wait list

05:31.905 --> 05:35.509

07:14.222 --> 07:16.503

right, kids?

07:19.938 --> 07:21.400
Jeremy: What's an interview?

07:21.420 --> 07:24.525

Oh, hi. Fine.

08:24.315 --> 08:26.454
I was told you canceled your appointment?

08:26.474 --> 08:30.111
Yeah, yeah, my daughter
has a science fair and I wanted to...

08:30.131 --> 08:33.345
I really think it's important
for you to come in tomorrow.

08:33.506 --> 08:35.866
We're reaching the point of no return.

08:36.065 --> 08:38.683
I know. I just...

08:40.159 --> 08:42.046
I...

08:42.104 --> 08:44.429
I need to talk to my husband.

08:44.788 --> 08:46.574
Well, you should do that.

08:46.608 --> 08:49.033
And then you'll be in tomorrow?

08:49.219 --> 08:50.403
Yes.

Good. See you then.

[Hangs up, sets down phone]

Patti, you ready to come in?

09:23.028 --> 09:24.612
[Giggling]

09:26.616 --> 09:27.565
It's a cat?

09:27.616 --> 09:29.033
Yeah. Ha ha ha!

09:29.067 --> 09:31.721
But it has a pop tart for its body,

09:31.741 --> 09:33.719
and it's just shooting through space

09:33.739 --> 09:36.157
and it has rainbows coming out of its butt

09:36.208 --> 09:38.209
and it's just really happy about it.

09:38.243 --> 09:40.211
[Giggling]

09:41.380 --> 09:43.142
I don't get it.

09:43.564 --> 09:45.301
No, dad,

09:45.612 --> 09:47.461
you don't.

09:48.975 --> 09:50.691
[Giggling]

09:51.783 --> 09:53.307
Kevin: Yeah,
and come home straight after school.

09:53.341 --> 09:56.180
Your mom and I need help
setting up for the party.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.930
Uh, he knows, you know.

09:57.950 --> 09:59.513
It's not gonna be a surprise.

09:59.515 --> 10:03.034
Yeah, I know, I know.
Just please don't tell your mom.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.129
[Kiss]

10:07.526 --> 10:09.462
You smell like cigarettes.

10:09.698 --> 10:10.904
What?

10:11.103 --> 10:12.460
Bye.

10:46.152 --> 10:47.394
What happened?

10:47.396 --> 10:50.003
I don't know.
They just all came running out.

10:50.023 --> 10:51.732

[Door opens]

Woman: Is it gone?

11:32.333 --> 11:34.049
What was it?

11:34.545 --> 11:36.531
It... it was a deer.

11:36.853 --> 11:38.553
[Ticking]

11:50.091 --> 11:51.675
Uh...

11:53.377 --> 11:56.680
I think something
terrible's about to happen.

11:58.754 --> 12:00.566
Tell me what that feels like.

12:02.030 --> 12:04.083
What it feels like?

12:04.103 --> 12:05.547
Yeah.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.358
I mean...

12:07.831 --> 12:10.361
Why is this time different?

12:11.218 --> 12:13.457
Because you've said this before,

12:13.477 --> 12:15.798
and we're still here.

12:15.922 --> 12:18.152
Those times...

12:19.151 --> 12:21.789
they were like... tremors.

12:23.134 --> 12:25.159
This...

12:25.318 --> 12:28.128
This is the big one...

12:29.201 --> 12:31.708
Like the world is gonna end.

12:33.793 --> 12:36.136
Then tell me how it feels.

12:39.814 --> 12:43.010
Like a hand is inside my chest...

12:43.946 --> 12:46.347
And it's squeezing my heart...

12:46.602 --> 12:48.816
tighter and tighter,

12:49.124 --> 12:52.569
and he won't let me go until it's over.

12:52.922 --> 12:54.104
"He"?

12:54.622 --> 12:55.974
What?

12:56.185 --> 12:58.525
"He" won't let go?

12:59.970 --> 13:02.134
[Scoffs] It's not about that.

13:02.154 --> 13:03.363
- It isn't?
- No, no.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.900
It's not about Neil telling
you to leave your own house?

13:08.893 --> 13:10.704
He paid for it.

13:11.156 --> 13:12.673
It's his house.

13:13.389 --> 13:17.344
That's... not how it works, Patti.

13:19.214 --> 13:22.716
But he told you to go, so you went.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.690
And all those abusive
things he said to you?

13:30.188 --> 13:33.566
That's what makes you feel
like the world is ending.

13:34.396 --> 13:38.866
Because instead of ignoring those things,
you... you believe them.

13:39.175 --> 13:41.402
You absorb them.

13:43.621 --> 13:46.907
Well, I guess I better shit 'em back out.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.844
Maybe you should.

13:51.104 --> 13:55.944
Maybe you should put them in a
bag and write Neil's name on it and just...

13:55.964 --> 13:58.942
drop it right back off on his doorstep.

13:59.227 --> 14:00.729
Come on.

14:01.723 --> 14:05.092
Well, if it'll stop the world from ending,
why the hell not?

14:06.855 --> 14:09.225
Nothing's going to stop that.

14:11.447 --> 14:12.933
I know why you're tellin' jokes,

14:12.935 --> 14:15.754
'cause you can feel it, too, can't you?

14:15.987 --> 14:18.037
I know you can.

14:18.993 --> 14:21.288
Something's wrong...

14:21.599 --> 14:23.444
inside you.

14:29.401 --> 14:32.144
Sorry, Patti, that's just not true.

14:36.030 --> 14:38.592
There's nothing wrong with me.

14:44.915 --> 14:47.062
Well, you're on the council, but nobody
knows who you are.

14:47.082 --> 14:50.343
Buddy Menlo is the incumbent. He's popular,
he has built-in name recognition,

14:50.363 --> 14:51.745
and we're a month out from the election,

14:51.765 --> 14:55.392
so if I'm being honest, barring a miracle,
I don't think you stand a chance.

14:55.443 --> 14:56.940
Uh-huh.

14:57.473 --> 14:59.563
And why should I hire you
if you can't help me win?

14:59.614 --> 15:01.698
Because I think you have some
progressive ideas for the town...

15:01.733 --> 15:03.534
Oh, fuck my progressive ideas.

15:03.568 --> 15:06.320
Why do you want to do this, uh...

15:06.322 --> 15:08.305
Nora Durst?

15:11.481 --> 15:13.467
Because...

15:14.485 --> 15:17.086
I want to use my brain
for more than figuring out

15:17.106 --> 15:20.417
which juice box is certified organic.

15:21.164 --> 15:23.053
I want...

15:27.070 --> 15:29.688
I need something for myself.

15:34.268 --> 15:37.985
I know I'm not running for
mayor of New York City,

15:38.296 --> 15:40.273
but for the next 4 weeks,

15:40.293 --> 15:42.850
I need this to be your priority.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.443
And what does that mean for the, um...
juice boxes?

15:46.463 --> 15:50.099
As far as you're concerned, for the
next 4 weeks, I don't have a family.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.465
Councilwoman.

15:57.098 --> 15:58.839
I'm in the middle of an interview.

15:58.873 --> 16:00.707
You comin' to my thing tonight?

16:00.709 --> 16:03.882
You're not supposed to know
you're having a thing tonight.

16:03.902 --> 16:07.314
And yet I do know. You comin' or not?

16:08.071 --> 16:10.510
I'm in the middle of an interview.

16:11.267 --> 16:12.719
Hey.

16:12.967 --> 16:15.002
You tell her she could beat buddy?

16:15.139 --> 16:16.677
Nope.

16:17.596 --> 16:18.442
Hire her.

16:18.476 --> 16:20.610
Now get the fuck out of here,

16:20.630 --> 16:22.330
man of the year.

16:31.188 --> 16:34.408
We're, uh, just friends, so...

16:34.700 --> 16:36.743
Moorland, you've got first and Broadway,

16:36.745 --> 16:38.899
and don't any of you
think you dodged a bullet

16:38.919 --> 16:40.831
'cause you'll all be
getting traffic control

16:40.851 --> 16:43.065
until con Ed's done with the gas lines,

16:43.085 --> 16:46.163
which should be in about a week.

16:46.436 --> 16:48.755
Now, in other good news...

16:48.757 --> 16:51.622
or bad news...
this heat wave's gonna continue,

16:51.642 --> 16:54.761
so water restriction is still in place,

16:54.763 --> 16:57.097
which means you issue a ticket to anybody

16:57.099 --> 17:00.495
who's sprinkling their
lawns between 6:00 and 10:00

17:00.515 --> 17:03.770
and it looks like we've got
ourselves a deer problem.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.772
Reports of the fuckers gettin'
stuck inside buildings.

17:06.824 --> 17:09.108
One wandered into the biggie superstore,

17:09.111 --> 17:12.000
another jammed through Rosalie
Darmody's baby shower...

17:12.020 --> 17:14.281
Think it's just one.

17:14.986 --> 17:16.364
Sorry?

17:16.910 --> 17:19.169
Deer.
I think it's just one.

17:20.136 --> 17:22.049
Oh, why do you think that?

17:22.069 --> 17:24.034
I saw it this morning.

17:24.054 --> 17:25.208
At the school?

17:25.260 --> 17:27.446
No, I just missed it at the school.
Before that.

17:27.467 --> 17:30.673
Lou: Just a theory, chief...
maybe this thing's in heat

17:30.693 --> 17:33.300
and just wants to fuck the lieutenant.
[Scattered laughter]

17:33.302 --> 17:34.718
Fuck you, Lou.

17:34.769 --> 17:37.581
Kevin Sr.: It doesn't matter
to me if it's deer singular

17:37.601 --> 17:39.901
or deer fuckin' plural.

17:39.921 --> 17:42.185
You are authorized to put it down.

17:42.205 --> 17:44.645
Well, we don't need to kill it.

17:47.613 --> 17:49.591
If it's dangerous

17:49.611 --> 17:51.006
and unstable,

17:51.026 --> 17:52.626
yes, we do.

17:52.646 --> 17:54.288
We get tranq guns from animal control.

17:54.322 --> 17:57.663
If we see it, we knock it out,
bring it back to the woods,

17:57.683 --> 17:59.040
let it go.

17:59.060 --> 18:00.393
Let it go?

18:00.413 --> 18:01.995
Yes.

18:04.808 --> 18:07.178
Ok, I'll make you a deal.

18:07.401 --> 18:08.802
You get a tranq gun,

18:08.836 --> 18:12.035
I'll have dispatch inform
you of any sightings,

18:12.055 --> 18:15.804
and you get there before
anyone with an actual weapon?

18:15.824 --> 18:16.893
Hallelujah.

18:16.928 --> 18:19.396
Set Bambi free.

18:20.056 --> 18:21.619
Good?

18:22.091 --> 18:23.654
Yes, good.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.185
Fantastic.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.689
Now,
I hope to not see any of you any time soon,

18:28.740 --> 18:32.049
especially tonight,
as I hate fuckin' parties.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.064
Dismissed.

18:34.084 --> 18:35.696
[Overlapping chatter]

18:38.141 --> 18:40.200
[Cell phone vibrating]

18:43.502 --> 18:45.606
- Hello?
- Tom: Dad.

18:46.065 --> 18:48.041
Tommy, you ok?

18:48.572 --> 18:50.273
I think I fucked up.

18:50.968 --> 18:52.596
Where are you?

18:53.524 --> 18:55.150
[Police radio static]

18:55.597 --> 18:57.050
Man: He's mostly sobered up.

18:57.101 --> 18:59.034
Guy's not pressing charges.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.054
He will if there's a next time.
I appreciate it.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.120
No problem.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.515
Come on.

19:06.309 --> 19:08.311
[Tom sighs, sniffles]

19:08.518 --> 19:09.863
Sorry.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.782
Glad you called me.

19:11.816 --> 19:13.798
[Handcuffs clicking]

19:14.063 --> 19:16.453
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

19:18.493 --> 19:20.404
Hey. Come on. It's ok.

19:21.211 --> 19:22.494
[Hisses] Ah!

19:22.514 --> 19:24.757
[Exhales sharply, sniffles]

19:26.532 --> 19:28.518
What did he do?

19:32.973 --> 19:34.604
This the house?

19:34.926 --> 19:36.757
Please don't. It was my fault. Dad...

19:36.759 --> 19:39.760
It's ok. Gonna talk to him.

19:57.072 --> 19:59.613
Would you get your dad for me, please?

20:06.885 --> 20:08.238
Yeah?

20:10.161 --> 20:12.563
- Shit.
- You know who I am?

20:12.861 --> 20:14.344
Look, man, he keeps coming here.

20:14.378 --> 20:16.296
- What happened?
- He was drunk.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.075
This is the third time.
I already told him...

20:18.095 --> 20:19.966
What happened?

20:20.110 --> 20:22.018
He doesn't understand
that this is not something

20:22.053 --> 20:23.804
- that I'm interested in.
- Did you touch him?

20:23.855 --> 20:25.637
- He tried to come into my house.
- Did you touch him?

20:25.657 --> 20:28.308
All I did was push him back... [Groans]

20:30.760 --> 20:31.978
If you touch my kid again,

20:31.980 --> 20:34.114
I will fuckin' kill you.

20:34.148 --> 20:36.233
[Breathing heavily]

20:44.699 --> 20:47.392
It... it's ok.

20:49.152 --> 20:50.901
[Car door closes]

20:58.955 --> 21:01.159
Why'd you have to tell me?

21:03.753 --> 21:07.302
Your mother thought it would be
the same as lying if we didn't.

21:10.253 --> 21:12.736
I'm your father, not him.

21:15.838 --> 21:17.774
I know.

21:21.227 --> 21:22.913
Why do you need to keep doing this?

21:22.947 --> 21:26.451
Because he shouldn't get to
pretend like it never happened.

21:29.537 --> 21:33.039
He did a terrible thing
to you and your mother.

21:36.961 --> 21:40.080
Sometimes you have to pretend.

21:49.807 --> 21:52.108
[Puppies yapping]

21:52.143 --> 21:55.662
Well, well, looks like someone chose you.

21:56.745 --> 21:59.407
- Is that the mother?
- Mm-hmm. Her third litter.

21:59.427 --> 22:01.151
Oh.

22:01.202 --> 22:03.620
They seem so young to be away from her.

22:03.986 --> 22:06.122
It's actually completely natural.

22:06.157 --> 22:08.124
They don't need her anymore.

22:08.159 --> 22:10.482
[Cell phone chimes]

22:17.589 --> 22:18.802
I'm sorry.

22:18.836 --> 22:20.667
It's my husband.

22:21.052 --> 22:22.806
He's not coming.

22:23.496 --> 22:25.251
Just bring him home.

22:25.271 --> 22:29.012
I promise, the minute your husband
sees him, he'll fall in love.

22:36.567 --> 22:38.355
Tsk. Sorry.

you got to clear off the table.

23:00.537 --> 23:02.629
The food's gonna be here,
and I need to set up.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.798
Almost done.

23:05.774 --> 23:07.032
Want me to help you?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.468
No, thanks.

23:10.071 --> 23:11.805
So, I, uh,

23:11.807 --> 23:13.807
I know you have your presentation tomorrow,

23:13.809 --> 23:15.499
and I really want to be there, but, uh,

23:15.519 --> 23:17.927
I have an appointment, and I tried to...

23:17.962 --> 23:21.231
That's ok. You weren't there last year.

23:23.704 --> 23:25.652
I'm a terrible mother.

23:27.328 --> 23:28.738
There's no need to be dramatic.

23:28.773 --> 23:31.206
I'm not being dramatic.

23:31.226 --> 23:32.410
[Scoffs] Come here!

23:32.430 --> 23:34.271
You're the best mom in the whole world.

Mwah! Tell mom she's the best.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.502
Well, she is the best.

- Right behind me.

so I went and picked him up.

Oh, well, fuck you very much. Ha ha!

25:43.441 --> 25:45.464

like that when I'm mayor.

- Oh, I'm sure. I won't.
- Ok!

25:47.286 --> 25:49.996

He didn't tell you about the deer?

25:50.016 --> 25:52.465
- What deer?
- The one that your husband wants

25:52.467 --> 25:54.934
to rescue and free back
into the wilderness.

25:54.969 --> 25:57.927
Apparently,
they've got a very special relationship.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.439
It's confused.

25:59.473 --> 26:03.476

inside of buildings. It's...

[Kiss]

26:24.378 --> 26:25.694
Come on. Up.

26:27.580 --> 26:29.917
Maybe it lost its family.

26:29.937 --> 26:31.282
Who did?

26:31.302 --> 26:32.386
The deer.

26:32.406 --> 26:34.893
Maybe it's looking for them at our school.

26:34.913 --> 26:36.976
Maybe, but he's not gonna come back

26:37.011 --> 26:40.129
ever again, ok? I promise. You're safe.

You said 6:00.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.884
One of the accounts fell apart.

27:18.779 --> 27:21.243
I can come home early tomorrow.

27:21.702 --> 27:22.973
Did I miss the window?

27:22.993 --> 27:24.557
No, go on in. She's still up.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.050

It went great.

My interview?

27:33.695 --> 27:35.201
Awesome.

27:41.091 --> 27:44.265
So the honorable judge Hader

27:44.285 --> 27:48.137
sidles up to me before the ceremony.

27:48.157 --> 27:50.133
He's there every year,
like he invented the fuckin' thing.

27:50.167 --> 27:51.768
[Lou laughing]

27:51.892 --> 27:55.588
Kevin Sr.: And he says,
"congratulations on this great honor."

27:55.780 --> 27:58.091
So I looked that cocksucker
right in the eyes

27:58.111 --> 28:00.260
and said, "can't be that great.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.428
They gave one to you."

28:02.430 --> 28:03.930

Everybody? Everybody.

28:30.066 --> 28:31.324
If I may,

28:31.344 --> 28:33.975
on behalf of the civic clergy association,

28:33.995 --> 28:36.957
I feel obligated to share with you...

28:36.977 --> 28:41.511
why I nominated our guest of honor for
Mapleton Man of the Year.

28:41.672 --> 28:43.269
Matt: The answer?

28:43.807 --> 28:45.305
I couldn't nominate myself.

28:45.307 --> 28:46.973
[Laughter]

28:48.504 --> 28:50.507
Matt: But seriously, this man, well,

28:50.527 --> 28:52.478
he's humble, he's gracious,

28:52.498 --> 28:55.481
he doesn't like me
saying how generous he is

28:55.483 --> 28:59.661
or what he's done for the church,
what he's done for me

28:59.810 --> 29:01.615
or the people of this town.

29:01.635 --> 29:03.124
Yeah. Yeah.

29:03.322 --> 29:05.575
But, hell, I just did. [Laughter]

29:06.015 --> 29:07.243

29:13.335 --> 29:15.835
Uh, this is a part of something

29:15.837 --> 29:19.639
that chief used to read
to me when I was a kid.

29:21.647 --> 29:23.176
Kevin: Ahem.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.179
A man said to the universe,

29:26.723 --> 29:29.682
"Sir, I exist."

29:30.452 --> 29:33.790
"However," the universe replied,

29:34.138 --> 29:36.689
"the fact has not created in me

29:36.740 --> 29:39.192
a sense of obligation."

29:39.991 --> 29:43.363
A lot of people think that
the world owes them something.

29:45.674 --> 29:47.379
But you, dad,

29:47.399 --> 29:49.870
you built your life...

29:50.515 --> 29:52.205
and mine

29:53.158 --> 29:54.734
on your own.

29:58.805 --> 30:00.880
Now look at me, you know,

30:01.631 --> 30:03.381
and look what I got.

30:03.741 --> 30:05.935
Guests: Mmm.

30:05.955 --> 30:07.575
Man: Yeah.

30:10.159 --> 30:11.144
To family.

30:11.164 --> 30:12.225
Yeah. Yeah.

Whoa!

[Dialogue fades out]

31:16.775 --> 31:19.418
You're just askin' to get caught.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.127
Oh, shit.

31:21.826 --> 31:22.628
[Chuckles]

31:22.679 --> 31:24.130
Thought you quit.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.739
