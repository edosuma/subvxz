00:03.662 --> 00:04.862
<i>Previously on Rogue...</i>

00:04.952 --> 00:07.652
- OK. What do we know?
- Sarah's gone.

00:07.945 --> 00:09.218
And we need to make sure that

00:09.219 --> 00:11.219
every available unit
is out there looking for her.

00:11.337 --> 00:12.737
Cheat's dead.

00:13.067 --> 00:15.082
Grace, see if you can
identify Cheat's dealer.

00:15.138 --> 00:18.138
Maybe this was a drug deal that went bad
and Sarah got caught in the middle.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.137
Who's prints are
on the condom wrapper?

00:20.237 --> 00:21.637
Kendra Willis.

00:22.094 --> 00:24.372
- Did he do that to you last night?
- I was here.

00:24.683 --> 00:26.659
Are you going to say it?
No?

00:26.759 --> 00:28.159
We gotta go get his money.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.930
- What do we got?
- No Sarah.

00:30.986 --> 00:32.987
But dried blood drops
beside the trunk

00:33.400 --> 00:36.270
and a bloody drag trail
from the vehicle to the water.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.949
If there gonna come
after us, then there's

00:37.962 --> 00:39.551
no way they're just
going to stop at Cheat.

00:39.651 --> 00:42.908
Grace, it's Elliot. Good work. Keep
surveilling, but under no circumstances

00:42.967 --> 00:44.137
do you approach or apprehend.
Am I clear?

00:44.150 --> 00:45.331
What?

00:45.496 --> 00:48.918
These guys are involved. We use this.
We bring them in for questioning.

00:49.018 --> 00:51.224
They might know what
happened to Sarah.

00:51.237 --> 00:53.454
Tell me what this case
is really about, Elliot.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.784
Alright. Treasury is
interested in dirty money

00:55.797 --> 00:58.038
our dead friend was
putting into circulation.

00:58.764 --> 01:00.917
- The money's gone.
- What do we do?

01:01.079 --> 01:02.479
What are we gonna do?

01:05.090 --> 01:08.239
<b># there's blood on our hands #</b>

01:11.513 --> 01:16.196
<b># in this perfect madness #</b>

01:17.596 --> 01:22.214

01:44.538 --> 01:45.938
Ethan, what do we do?

01:48.597 --> 01:51.155
<i>504 TD,
why aren't you at your post?</i>

01:51.221 --> 01:53.550
<i>- 'Cause you just sent me here.
- Oh, shit. We gotta go.</i>

01:53.650 --> 01:57.093
<i>- Return to 234 West 28th immediately.
- We gotta go, let's go, let's go.</i>

01:57.193 --> 01:58.693
Cheat never partied alone.

01:59.241 --> 02:01.089
We need to find out
who was here with him.

02:01.177 --> 02:02.868
Yeah, if they're still alive.

02:07.790 --> 02:10.190
<i>504 TD, report location.</i>

02:15.410 --> 02:17.372
<i>Approaching West 19th.</i>

02:25.758 --> 02:27.058
- Hey. Hey.
- Fuck.

02:27.158 --> 02:28.789
- Keep it down.
- There's someone up there.

02:28.938 --> 02:30.338
Ray, two blocks...

02:30.830 --> 02:33.530
- He's two blocks away.
- Spud, I am telling you...

02:34.830 --> 02:36.230
Let's go. Let's go.

02:37.262 --> 02:38.662
Ray! Ray!

02:41.982 --> 02:43.382
Let's go!

02:44.329 --> 02:45.729
- One block.
- Go.

03:07.769 --> 03:09.169
What's going on?

03:12.916 --> 03:15.512
They were there,
searching for bugs.

03:17.090 --> 03:20.034
And Sarah was made,
planting bugs.

03:20.305 --> 03:21.705
And we don't bring them in?

03:21.734 --> 03:23.428
Well, hauling them in
was only going to alert

03:23.441 --> 03:25.145
them to the fact that we
knew they were there.

03:25.245 --> 03:27.769
- That we're on to them.
- But we are on to them.

03:34.501 --> 03:36.834
You've had us operating
blind from day one.

03:41.315 --> 03:42.965
This isn't about prostitution.

03:43.374 --> 03:44.774
We're following dirty money.

03:45.785 --> 03:47.185
What kind of dirty?

03:49.492 --> 03:50.892
Elliot?

03:52.688 --> 03:55.267
Chetowski was laundering money
at casinos in Reno.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.897
Buying dirty, cash out clean.

04:00.361 --> 04:03.668
Anything under 10,000 isn't registered
by the Gaming Commission.

04:04.261 --> 04:06.873
It only came to our attention
because he got lazy.

04:08.270 --> 04:10.409
He did it once too often
in the same place.

04:10.509 --> 04:11.909
Where did the money come from?

04:12.665 --> 04:14.318
That's what we're here to find out.

04:17.486 --> 04:18.886
So...

04:22.499 --> 04:25.507
So we focus on
what happened last night.

04:28.419 --> 04:29.928
I need to show you something.

04:41.998 --> 04:45.486
He doesn't talk to anyone unusual.
Fast forward it, will you, Spud?

04:46.329 --> 04:47.629
What time did he even leave?

04:47.729 --> 04:50.350
I don't know.
Must have been after I was gone, I mean.

04:50.409 --> 04:51.885
I was home by 10:00, right?

04:51.985 --> 04:54.504
We shot pool 'til 1:00.
Cheat was gone when we left.

04:54.604 --> 04:56.004
You know what?
Right there.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.176
He left alone, he must have called
someone on the way home...

05:00.276 --> 05:02.519
- Kendra?
- He was partying with a lot of girls.

05:02.573 --> 05:03.973
Yeah,

05:04.281 --> 05:05.882
but she was
the flavor of the month.

05:16.222 --> 05:18.093
No. I don't think that's Sarah.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.974
- Then who?
- Kendra Willis.

05:22.282 --> 05:25.332
I think that she was lying when she
said she wasn't there the other night.

05:25.363 --> 05:27.719
We're still waiting on the lab
for those DNA results.

05:27.762 --> 05:31.956
Well, who ever it is... six minutes
after they leave, there's this...

05:37.422 --> 05:40.156
Yeah, I know. I thought it was
part of the song at first, but

05:40.217 --> 05:42.217
it only happens once.
Listen.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.025
There.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.581
That's the sound of the door opening.
Someone else came in.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.961
Now that's Sarah.

05:55.545 --> 05:58.825
So whoever came late to the party,
they find her

06:00.286 --> 06:01.686
and all hell breaks loose.

06:12.571 --> 06:14.071
Who else knew about the money?

06:15.630 --> 06:17.908
Maybe Cheat flashed some
cash to some hooker.

06:19.257 --> 06:21.223
What, she kills him, then
makes it look like an OD?

06:21.236 --> 06:23.213
That doesn't explain
the bullet holes.

06:27.146 --> 06:28.546
It's Massoud.

06:31.729 --> 06:34.353
We don't know that.
Easy.

06:35.994 --> 06:39.944
Look, if those bills
go into circulation,

06:40.039 --> 06:41.439
it lights up the Treasury.

06:42.275 --> 06:45.294
The Feds, they follow it right to us.
Do you understand that now?

06:45.394 --> 06:46.794
And then we're dead.

06:48.653 --> 06:50.162
We're electric chair dead.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.262
I fucking hope that it's Massoud.

06:53.362 --> 06:56.295
That he got what he came for
and he just goes home with it.

06:56.395 --> 06:57.795
Oh, no, no. But wait.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.692
He didn't get it all, did he?

07:00.126 --> 07:02.438
He only got two and a half mil.
We're dead either way.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.057
So what do we do?

07:06.974 --> 07:08.553
I'm gonna take a look at Kendra.

07:09.033 --> 07:10.333
I want you to take a
look at Cheat's dealer.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.656
You understand?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.365
And if it's Massoud?

07:15.617 --> 07:17.262
Well, that's a
whole different fight.

07:21.989 --> 07:23.389
Grace.

07:25.251 --> 07:26.651
Good work.

07:27.547 --> 07:30.726
I just want to find Sarah.
And those guys are involved.

07:31.481 --> 07:34.815
I know they gave Detective Lee alibis,
but I'm going to see if they hold up.

07:42.858 --> 07:45.658
If us working together again
is going to be a problem for you...

07:46.085 --> 07:48.885
You already lost one operative. You
really want to make her work in the dark?

07:48.985 --> 07:51.134
- It wasn't your call.
- Oh, you're pulling rank?

07:51.159 --> 07:53.543
- Why, is it a problem for you?
- Not for me.

07:53.822 --> 07:55.609
Well next time,
clear it with me first.

08:07.521 --> 08:08.896
I'm sorry.

08:08.897 --> 08:11.843
I can't do anything without
my manager's say-so.

08:11.942 --> 08:13.563
And what would your
manager say if I hauled

08:13.576 --> 08:15.207
your ass out of work
for obstruction?

08:15.246 --> 08:18.323
Probably the refusal to answer
a police officer's questions

08:18.423 --> 08:20.898
does not constitute
intentional interference.

08:20.998 --> 08:22.746
Giving misleading information,

08:22.846 --> 08:24.985
warning someone who has
committed a crime so

08:24.998 --> 08:27.148
that they can escape
detection, Detective?

08:27.204 --> 08:28.604
You study to be a cop?

08:29.385 --> 08:32.424
What'd you flunk?
The physical or the written?

08:32.525 --> 08:36.602
I'm in peak physical condition and
I answered every question truthfully.

08:36.702 --> 08:38.580
Yeah, I mean if every
applicant wrote down the

08:38.592 --> 08:40.482
real reason they wanted
a badge and a gun

08:40.532 --> 08:41.847
there'd be no one
in the PD, right?

08:41.861 --> 08:43.188
Yeah well I mean it's
too late for that now.

08:43.238 --> 08:44.808
Come on, everyone reapplies.

08:45.127 --> 08:47.726
I did.
Like, three times.

08:47.826 --> 08:48.915
Really?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.310
Yeah, they got these
sample answers online.

08:51.710 --> 08:53.406
Help you sound more...

08:53.506 --> 08:55.433
you know, civic minded.

08:56.137 --> 08:57.812
Yeah, worked for me.

09:01.337 --> 09:03.950
So detective,
do you have Ethan Kelly

09:04.050 --> 09:07.518
getting home on the
14th at 10:00 PM?

09:08.212 --> 09:11.214
Yeah.
The Warriors game was on.

09:11.314 --> 09:14.558
And Curry was raining treys
over D. Rose all night.

09:14.658 --> 09:18.175
Oh, Mr. Kelly came in at
the start of the 4th.

09:18.415 --> 09:19.815
Just after 10:00.

09:20.969 --> 09:22.825
You got a camera
in the parking garage?

09:23.221 --> 09:24.621
Yeah.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.839
And I-- I really appreciate
your discretion on this.

09:29.808 --> 09:31.999
Need to know...
Got it.

09:40.363 --> 09:42.606
Ethan Kelly got home at 10:00.

09:43.035 --> 09:44.722
He made sure
the doorman saw him.

09:44.822 --> 09:46.222
Then half an hour later...

09:46.322 --> 09:48.500
this has him leaving
the parking garage,

09:48.600 --> 09:50.676
I got Detective Lee
to run his plates

09:50.776 --> 09:54.127
and the traffic cam last snaps him
eight blocks from the crime scene.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.007
Toxicology is back.

09:57.017 --> 09:59.982
Along with a lot of coke,
there was fentanyl in Chetowski's system.

10:00.054 --> 10:01.454
40% fentanyl.

10:03.113 --> 10:06.126
The bad blow you see around here
is only ever cut with 15%.

10:07.892 --> 10:11.209
So someone knows fentanyl's going around,
mixes up their own recipe.

10:12.947 --> 10:16.744
- You think Kelly killed his best friend?
- The other guy's alibis check out.

10:17.763 --> 10:19.163
Why is he lying?

10:20.622 --> 10:22.718
So Ethan William Kelly...

10:23.621 --> 10:25.876
graduated top 10%
of his law school class,

10:25.972 --> 10:27.714
then he gives it all up
after 9/11.

10:28.383 --> 10:31.024
An idealist.
How sweet.

10:31.309 --> 10:35.149
Enlists with the Rangers,
aces the intel course at Huachuca.

10:35.717 --> 10:38.489
He serves three years Iraq
then four in Afghanistan.

10:38.589 --> 10:40.180
Multiple declarations.

10:41.054 --> 10:44.916
Jesus, I don't know whether
I should arrest him or marry him.

10:45.375 --> 10:47.464
Well, right now you don't
have a shot at either.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.478
What'd you get with Blue Vine?

10:49.938 --> 10:51.338
It's a payroll company.

10:51.993 --> 10:54.201
I traced it back to a
dozen shell companies.

10:54.301 --> 10:56.770
It's registered all over the place.
Panama, Caymans...

10:56.870 --> 11:00.451
When I get to the bottom of it,
I find it's a private security outfit,

11:00.777 --> 11:02.734
babysitting businessmen
in the Middle East,

11:03.401 --> 11:04.926
government contracts, the usual.

11:05.026 --> 11:06.426
Are they mercenaries?

11:06.990 --> 11:08.390
Yeah, no one will talk.

11:09.450 --> 11:12.140
I put a call in to the Pentagon,
I have a friend there.

11:12.529 --> 11:14.029
I'm waiting to hear back.

11:15.017 --> 11:16.417
I'm telling you...

11:16.814 --> 11:18.214
he's our guy.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.008
He knows what happened to Sarah.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.632
Put him under surveillance.

11:22.732 --> 11:24.032
Not you're call.

11:24.052 --> 11:25.452
Have your keeper get on it.

11:27.243 --> 11:28.845
I'll check in with Lee.

11:54.996 --> 11:57.310
That detective, Breño...

11:58.782 --> 12:00.526
did he ever go back undercover?

12:02.559 --> 12:03.959
No.

12:08.372 --> 12:10.625
Hey.
They found something.

12:16.398 --> 12:18.217
Yeah, they filed that right down.

12:18.317 --> 12:19.717
OK.

12:20.697 --> 12:23.395
Yeah, the divers recovered this
about 50 feet out.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.382
The serial number's been filed clean,

12:26.901 --> 12:30.580
but the caliber matches the three
slugs recovered at Cheat's place.

12:31.523 --> 12:33.134
And two more shots were fired.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.354
Double-tap.

12:35.626 --> 12:37.026
We don't know that.

12:37.621 --> 12:39.133
With the currents and the tides...

12:39.593 --> 12:42.297
Coast Guard says she could be
five miles out to sea by now.

12:42.397 --> 12:43.797
We keep looking.

12:44.254 --> 12:45.976
They don't hold out much
hope she'll be recovered.

12:45.989 --> 12:47.721
We keep looking.

12:49.193 --> 12:50.593
Of course,

12:50.969 --> 12:54.510
- but we have to face facts.
- Grace? Where you going?

12:54.937 --> 12:56.500
Yeah. Sarah's apartment.

12:56.677 --> 12:57.877
I'll send Lee.

12:57.901 --> 13:00.276
I'm her handler.
I wanna do this.

13:00.376 --> 13:02.985
Any evidence of this operation at
Sarah's place...

13:03.513 --> 13:04.913
you bring it back.

13:05.486 --> 13:06.886
I want it on my desk.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.028
Greg you're so good to me...

13:25.635 --> 13:27.035
I love it when...

13:29.514 --> 13:30.914
Cum for me, baby.

13:48.656 --> 13:50.056
I need a place to stay.

13:50.847 --> 13:52.147
One more night.

13:52.172 --> 13:53.572
Two max.

13:55.732 --> 13:58.132
There's something you're not quite
getting here, Kendra.

13:59.924 --> 14:01.481
I pay you to leave.

14:02.110 --> 14:03.510
Come on.

14:04.329 --> 14:06.051
You hardly use this place.

14:08.544 --> 14:09.944
Please?

14:22.622 --> 14:24.254
Oh, hey!

14:29.966 --> 14:31.366
Are you hungry?

14:34.058 --> 14:35.458
Yeah?

14:42.858 --> 14:44.058
<i>Hey, Sarah.</i>

14:44.082 --> 14:45.865
<i>It's Jessie. Uh...
Give me a call back.</i>

14:45.923 --> 14:47.323
<i>Alright, bye.</i>

14:51.043 --> 14:52.931
<i>Hey, Sarah, it's me again.</i>

14:53.031 --> 14:54.825
<i>If you're there, pick up.</i>

14:56.814 --> 14:59.086
<i>OK, well uh...
hit me back.</i>

15:03.100 --> 15:05.481
<i>Are you overpaying
for bank charges?</i>

15:05.972 --> 15:08.448
<i>Just call back now to
learn how you may be</i>

15:08.461 --> 15:10.947
<i>able to save hundreds
of dollars each year.</i>

15:16.846 --> 15:18.713
<i>Hey Sarah, um...</i>

15:19.769 --> 15:22.750
<i>What's happening? You wanna...
You wanna give me a call back here?</i>

15:23.491 --> 15:24.891
<i>Did you lose my number?</i>

15:25.950 --> 15:27.350
<i>Alright. Bye.</i>

15:28.168 --> 15:29.815
_

15:29.817 --> 15:32.155
<i>Sarah, Jesus Christ!
How many times do I gotta to call you?</i>

15:32.205 --> 15:34.478
<i>Pick the phone up and call me back.
What's going on?</i>

15:38.233 --> 15:41.620
<i>This is an important message
concerning your health insurance.</i>

15:41.720 --> 15:45.593
<i>You may not be fully covered
in the event of a serious illness.</i>

15:45.693 --> 15:51.198
<i>Call us now. Don't delay! It could
be the most important call you make.</i>

16:08.314 --> 16:09.714
Jessie!

16:10.734 --> 16:12.134
You're Grace?

16:12.285 --> 16:13.685
I got your message.

16:13.993 --> 16:15.638
Why do you have Lucy?
Where's Sarah?

16:19.555 --> 16:21.923
- What happened, is she OK?
- She's missing.

16:31.395 --> 16:32.795
What do you mean missing?

16:39.385 --> 16:40.821
Sh-she's dead, isn't she?

16:42.561 --> 16:43.761
Fuck!

16:43.832 --> 16:45.991
Does she have any family?
Any one I can talk to?

16:48.547 --> 16:49.947
None.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.451
No, not that I know of.

16:53.315 --> 16:55.093
How long were you two
seeing each other?

16:55.296 --> 16:58.478
I don't know, like...
six, seven months?

16:59.017 --> 17:00.417
Will you take the dog?

17:01.818 --> 17:04.920
Ho-how am I going to explain to my wife
why I have another woman's dog?

17:05.224 --> 17:06.625
Mm-hmm.

17:08.953 --> 17:11.309
My shit's at her place,
can I get in there and get it?

17:12.289 --> 17:15.032
Wow.
That is classy.

17:16.318 --> 17:17.518
You know what?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.338
- She hated you guys.
- Yeah.

17:19.438 --> 17:22.275
Especially after all that
Grimaldi shit last year!

17:23.257 --> 17:24.557
Grimaldi?

17:24.656 --> 17:26.366
Fucking cops.
Man, whatever!

17:26.465 --> 17:27.866
Come on, Lucy.

17:35.124 --> 17:36.524
Come on.

17:55.171 --> 17:56.571
Want some water?

17:56.793 --> 17:58.238
What's all that noise?

17:58.338 --> 17:59.738
I'm just really thirsty.

18:01.650 --> 18:03.459
Uh-uh, you don't want
to go over there.

18:04.066 --> 18:05.266
You OK, Gracie?

18:05.319 --> 18:06.719
Where's Evie?

18:16.044 --> 18:17.444
Oh my...

18:17.488 --> 18:19.534
God, where did you come from?

18:22.131 --> 18:24.110
- Mom!
- Oh! God!

18:24.149 --> 18:25.549
Get out!

18:28.641 --> 18:30.403
Hey...

18:30.896 --> 18:32.296
whose dog are you?

18:38.138 --> 18:40.762
- Did you know he was in there?
- Did I know?

18:41.667 --> 18:44.372
It was all I could do not to
peek through the keyhole.

18:57.481 --> 18:59.572
Hmm. Could I get you kids a drink?

19:00.788 --> 19:02.188
Gracie?

19:02.958 --> 19:05.736
- Where'd you get the dog, mom?
- Can I have a beer?

19:07.350 --> 19:09.974
Sorry, it was...
a stupid joke.

19:10.137 --> 19:11.537
Mom? The dog?

19:12.816 --> 19:15.267
Ahh... yeah. Um...

19:15.367 --> 19:17.689
A friend asked me
to look after her for a while.

19:18.429 --> 19:19.829
Why?

19:20.138 --> 19:21.925
You've always wanted a dog.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.761
Why now?

19:25.149 --> 19:26.549
So, Billy...

19:29.382 --> 19:30.782
how's your mom?

19:31.209 --> 19:32.889
She's doing good.
She's better...

19:33.305 --> 19:34.705
I suppose.

19:34.814 --> 19:36.633
Yeah, I've been meaning to call her.

19:37.268 --> 19:38.668
I'm sure she'd like that.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.181
What about you?
How are you?

19:42.398 --> 19:43.798
Let's walk the dog.

19:44.462 --> 19:47.107
I didn't even know
you guys were in touch, so...

19:47.651 --> 19:49.673
How long have you been...

19:49.773 --> 19:51.285
- We're not mom.
- A few weeks.

19:51.352 --> 19:53.127
- Huh?
- Leaving now.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.551
- You wait.
- What!?

20:03.521 --> 20:04.921
For the shit.

20:05.993 --> 20:07.393
Good to see you, Ms. Travis.

20:07.719 --> 20:09.823
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on, dog.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.714
Embarrassing your daughter.

20:18.814 --> 20:20.543
Aw, come on.
It's a mother's right.

20:20.643 --> 20:22.249
He's so strapping!

20:22.997 --> 20:25.621
- Strapping?
- Yeah, it's a word.

20:26.361 --> 20:27.761
Or it was.

20:29.310 --> 20:31.060
Evie is not ready.

20:31.128 --> 20:34.700
Oh, yes. She's ready.
You're the one who's not ready.

20:40.372 --> 20:41.772
Yeah, he's a good kid.

20:42.830 --> 20:44.230
I suppose it could be worse.

20:47.585 --> 20:48.985
Which one was his mother?

20:50.942 --> 20:52.342
Hey, Gracie.

20:53.716 --> 20:55.266
His father died.

20:56.345 --> 20:59.564
Mitch.
I worked with him.

21:00.537 --> 21:04.126
- He was a good man. Good cop.
- What happened to him?

21:05.598 --> 21:09.211
- He was shot, on duty.
- God, that's terrible.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.732
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

21:20.462 --> 21:22.149
Sorry. That was so weird.

21:23.069 --> 21:26.172
It's alright, don't apologize. I would
say your mom is kind of cool, actually.

21:26.212 --> 21:28.413
- You think?
- Yeah, I mean she's not some...

21:28.862 --> 21:31.737
- corporate suit, or lawyer.
- Shrink?

21:33.198 --> 21:34.598
Right.

21:36.139 --> 21:38.756
- You should buy Evie condoms.
- What?

21:38.818 --> 21:41.338
Well, better they do it here
than in the back of a car.

21:42.297 --> 21:44.739
You know what?
I don't need parental advice from you.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.918
Well...
at least he's age appropriate.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.314
You're really going
to bring that up now?

21:59.459 --> 22:00.859
After 20 years?

22:04.505 --> 22:05.905
I got work to do.

22:05.906 --> 22:07.498
Mmm.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.427
OK, so we steal this
douchebag teacher's car.

22:11.527 --> 22:13.876
Sticker-bomb it,
then dump it in Union Square.

22:14.276 --> 22:16.604
- That's awesome.
- Yeah. Except now...

22:17.113 --> 22:19.822
my mom drags me to a shrink
'cause she's convinced that I'm...

22:19.861 --> 22:21.054
you know, acting out
'cause of everything.

22:21.067 --> 22:22.270
Yeah.

22:22.370 --> 22:25.270
So I say to the shrink...
"There's three other guys in the car,

22:25.370 --> 22:28.482
none of their dad's are dead, why am I
the only one being called crazy?"

22:28.631 --> 22:30.031
Exactly.

22:30.218 --> 22:33.285
Everyone thinks everything I do is just
'cause my little brother died.

22:34.356 --> 22:35.779
Hey, come here.

22:47.230 --> 22:48.430
What the..

22:48.630 --> 22:50.057
- Fuck!
- Stand up!

22:51.081 --> 22:52.777
That's it.
Away from the table.

22:53.948 --> 22:56.390
Cross your arms. Put your hands
inside your bra. Do it now.

22:56.430 --> 22:59.359
That's it.
Good. Do not fucking move.

23:01.662 --> 23:04.560
Who the fuck are you?
The fuck you want?

23:04.584 --> 23:06.766
Two nights ago, where were you?

23:06.866 --> 23:08.266
What?

23:09.867 --> 23:11.000
Ahh!

23:11.090 --> 23:13.980
You remember now?
Cheat. That's what I'm talking about.

23:14.197 --> 23:15.598
- Never heard of him.
- No?

23:15.698 --> 23:17.300
Maybe this will jog your memory.

23:17.993 --> 23:20.121
Alright, alright.
Alright, I sold to him, OK?

23:20.221 --> 23:22.921
But I cut him off weeks ago.
Motherfucker was out of control.

23:23.021 --> 23:26.676
Yeah? That motherfucker was my friend.
My friend.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.561
I cut him off man, I swear.

23:31.363 --> 23:32.763
It wasn't my gear.

23:34.398 --> 23:36.265
Man, what the fuck
do you want me to say?!

23:38.041 --> 23:39.341
Fucking stay down you punk.

23:39.441 --> 23:40.841
Stop it!

23:42.121 --> 23:44.340
Stop it!
Oh, God!

23:44.640 --> 23:46.836
He's gonna die!

24:17.579 --> 24:19.508
<i>- Yeah, Agent Hale.
- Elliot.</i>

24:19.608 --> 24:22.881
<i>- You still on him?
- Yeah. At the hooker's place.</i>

24:33.166 --> 24:35.534
You don't look like
a Jehovah's Witness.

24:36.265 --> 24:37.510
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

24:37.565 --> 24:40.563
Oh, you're not disappointing.
Not yet.

24:40.663 --> 24:44.165
Well I'll try to keep that going.
Is Kendra around?

24:44.995 --> 24:48.121
- And... now you're disappointing.
- Oh yeah, why's that?

24:48.255 --> 24:49.977
I told your partner earlier,
I don't know anything.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.723
Did you say partner?

24:52.570 --> 24:54.632
- Can you move your foot please?
- Were the cops here?

24:54.668 --> 24:57.421
- Can you move your foot please?
- Were the cops here, I asked you.

24:57.470 --> 24:59.369
Can you move your foot,
pretty please?

25:02.179 --> 25:03.579
Thanks!

25:06.129 --> 25:07.529
What did you tell them?

25:08.921 --> 25:10.409
Come here.
Where you going?

25:11.550 --> 25:12.950
Look.

25:13.961 --> 25:15.361
This make you feel any better?

25:16.190 --> 25:17.590
Get some nice shoes...

25:18.857 --> 25:21.369
Huh?
What do you want?

25:21.556 --> 25:24.180
You want something, don't you?
There you go.

25:24.873 --> 25:27.303
- What's your name?
- Frankie.

25:27.566 --> 25:29.630
Frankie? You're pretty Frankie.

25:30.149 --> 25:31.349
Frankie.

25:31.449 --> 25:32.886
OK, I'll tell you what Frankie.

25:32.967 --> 25:34.696
- What?
- This is my last $100 now.

25:36.838 --> 25:39.362
Here...
Give me some information, talk to me.

25:39.462 --> 25:42.262
I need to know where she is.
Who's she with?

25:42.633 --> 25:45.494
Where is she?
Here. Come on.

25:46.991 --> 25:49.371
- Kendra's with a date.
- Yeah?

25:50.228 --> 25:51.921
With some guy named Craig.

25:52.293 --> 25:55.054
Yeah, he lives on Pacific Heights.

25:55.742 --> 25:57.142
Thank you.

25:57.233 --> 25:58.633
Hey!

26:00.660 --> 26:02.302
<i>The cops were looking for Kendra.</i>

26:02.718 --> 26:05.070
<i>- Why? Well what did she say?
- I don't know.</i>

26:05.568 --> 26:07.813
<i>Look.
Get into her email.</i>

26:08.596 --> 26:10.915
Get me an address
on a Craig in Pacific Heights.

26:11.015 --> 26:13.245
<i>- I'm on it.</i>
- Alright.

26:37.963 --> 26:39.363
You need to leave.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.398
What do you think that was?

26:42.137 --> 26:43.537
Rent!

26:44.606 --> 26:47.820
- You said I could stay.
- Well, I changed my mind.

26:48.005 --> 26:49.405
I have nowhere to go.

26:50.249 --> 26:51.938
I could really use
a friend right now.

26:53.198 --> 26:54.598
Please!

27:07.529 --> 27:08.729
Mom!

27:08.911 --> 27:10.311
What?

27:12.035 --> 27:13.665
I'm trying to work in here.

27:18.246 --> 27:19.646
Can you turn it down?

27:22.617 --> 27:24.017
Mom!

27:24.051 --> 27:26.590
What? I turned it down.
Can't you work in your room?

27:32.765 --> 27:34.015
Travis.

27:34.064 --> 27:37.822
Kendra Willis.
Her DNA was all over Cheat's body.

27:38.952 --> 27:41.374
- Yeah, I knew it.
<i>- Yeah, I'm going to pick her up.</i>

27:41.904 --> 27:44.603
<i>There's more...
That blood by the water?</i>

27:45.774 --> 27:47.174
It's Sarah's.

27:48.638 --> 27:50.038
<i>Grace...</i>

28:23.011 --> 28:24.411
Hey.

28:25.219 --> 28:26.627
Hey, what are you doing here?

28:27.806 --> 28:29.556
- Ethan Kelly is in there?
- Uh-huh.

28:30.030 --> 28:32.340
Well, what the fuck
are you doing sitting in here?

28:32.440 --> 28:34.094
Kendra Willis is inside.

28:34.510 --> 28:36.212
Elliot told me to observe.

28:39.257 --> 28:40.657
Heads up.

28:53.891 --> 28:55.291
Follow him.

29:51.094 --> 29:52.294
<i>Lenny?</i>

29:52.373 --> 29:55.632
Yeah, I'm in the house
that Kendra Willis was using.

29:56.457 --> 29:57.857
She's dead.

29:58.069 --> 29:59.469
<i>So's her boyfriend.</i>

29:59.993 --> 30:03.171
Two shots each.
One to the head and to the chest.

30:04.558 --> 30:06.697
Ethan Kelly was leaving
when I got here.

30:07.959 --> 30:10.781
<i>- What do you want me to do?</i>
- Did you see him with a gun?

30:11.102 --> 30:12.633
- No.
- Fuck!

30:12.733 --> 30:14.133
<i>Are we picking him up?</i>

30:16.337 --> 30:17.737
Elliot!

30:29.501 --> 30:32.354
- Jesus.
- Well, it wasn't the dealer.

30:33.090 --> 30:34.490
You're sure?

30:35.145 --> 30:36.545
Yeah, I'm sure.

30:40.308 --> 30:41.998
I packed up some
of Cheat's stuff.

30:45.817 --> 30:48.262
Oh, you think his sister's
still gonna want these? Huh?

30:52.321 --> 30:54.601
I still think he's gonna
walk in any minute.

30:56.453 --> 30:57.853
Yeah, late as usual.

31:01.966 --> 31:03.366
Kendra's dead.

31:03.658 --> 31:06.953
- What?
- She was shot, along with her John.

31:07.353 --> 31:08.753
Wait a second, how?

31:09.646 --> 31:11.203
They were executed, Ray.

31:13.257 --> 31:14.657
Massoud.

31:18.339 --> 31:19.739
Who's this?

31:22.650 --> 31:25.074
- Ethan Kelly?
- Yes, sir.

31:25.086 --> 31:26.138
You're under arrest.

31:26.151 --> 31:27.214
Hey, hey guys.
You can't just march in...

31:27.314 --> 31:28.614
- Stand back! - It's alright.
- Don't move.

31:28.714 --> 31:30.470
You're under the arrest
on suspicion for the

31:30.483 --> 31:32.249
murder of Kendra Willis
and Craig Johnson.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.426
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Hold it a second, what is this?

31:34.526 --> 31:36.048
Relax.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.593
Anything you say can and
will be used against you.

31:37.693 --> 31:39.806
- Do you understand?
- Sure.

31:40.325 --> 31:42.708
- Stay here, Ethan. Stay here.
- Alright, this way.

31:42.816 --> 31:44.585
- Ethan!
- Come on, move. Move.

31:49.633 --> 31:53.556
- His hands came up clean for GSR.
- So he was wearing gloves.

31:53.656 --> 31:55.407
Well, if he used gloves,
we can't find them.

31:55.420 --> 31:57.182
Or the gun.

31:57.282 --> 31:59.258
A man's dead in
the company of a prostitute.

31:59.290 --> 32:01.360
Now I don't want to tell you how
to do your job, Detective,

32:01.395 --> 32:03.743
but uh...
you might want to talk to his wife.

32:04.183 --> 32:05.820
How do you know he was married?

32:06.350 --> 32:07.750
Well, he's banging hookers.

32:08.153 --> 32:09.553
What?

32:10.126 --> 32:12.444
Look, I'm asking the questions here.
How do you know--

32:15.998 --> 32:19.357
I want every backyard,
bush and storm drain,

32:19.443 --> 32:21.181
from the crime scene to
his office searched.

32:21.194 --> 32:22.943
And then search it
all over again.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.100
We need to find the gun.

32:25.966 --> 32:28.280
Did you lose this guy
when you were tailing him?

32:29.620 --> 32:31.620
You told me he was a
surveillance specialist.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.958
You told me to keep a loose tail.

32:35.769 --> 32:37.169
So you lost him.

32:37.758 --> 32:39.158
For a couple minutes.

32:41.241 --> 32:43.102
Five, maybe six minutes tops.

32:43.445 --> 32:45.582
You didn't lose him, he lost you.

32:46.202 --> 32:49.257
He made you and then he dumped the
gun and the gloves.

32:49.357 --> 32:52.895
Alright. Get back in there and plant a
story about a neighbor seeing him leave.

32:52.937 --> 32:55.038
He can't know we had eyes on him.

32:59.321 --> 33:01.471
Come on, come on.
Let me get in there.

33:04.091 --> 33:05.806
- No.
- Why?

33:05.906 --> 33:07.306
Lee's getting killed!

33:07.950 --> 33:09.855
Yeah, this is a clusterfuck.

33:09.868 --> 33:11.783
Why the fuck did you
tell Lee to hang back?!

33:14.309 --> 33:16.656
When he's done,
get him out of here.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.339
Jeez.
Where'd you find that guy?

33:22.439 --> 33:24.302
And I used to be his boss.

33:25.225 --> 33:26.625
Seriously?

33:29.172 --> 33:32.172
No, he's OK.
Once you get to know him.

33:33.492 --> 33:36.598
You mean he's a dick and then
you just get used to him.

33:49.594 --> 33:50.994
There was this man.

33:51.705 --> 33:54.238
He was starving,
his family was starving.

33:55.838 --> 33:58.164
So he stole a goat
from Massoud's land.

33:58.591 --> 34:00.325
He knew it was
a death sentence, but...

34:00.933 --> 34:03.721
it was either that or
let his family starve, so...

34:05.454 --> 34:07.497
When Massoud's men came for him,

34:07.945 --> 34:12.110
the man pleaded not for his life,
but for that of his wife...

34:12.681 --> 34:14.179
who was innocent of the crime.

34:14.873 --> 34:16.333
Massoud looked at them...

34:16.974 --> 34:18.724
and he smiled and he said,

34:20.089 --> 34:22.585
"No one on my land
should go hungry."

34:24.141 --> 34:26.580
"Bring food for
this man and his wife."

34:27.406 --> 34:31.074
And they...
They had a great feast.

34:34.339 --> 34:37.373
And it wasn't until
the man and his wife got home...

34:43.299 --> 34:45.293
that uh...
they realized...

34:48.194 --> 34:52.308
that they had eaten
their own children.

34:59.724 --> 35:01.124
That's a sack of shit!

35:06.824 --> 35:08.224
Fuck!

35:10.178 --> 35:11.428
Why you guys
sitting around in the dark?

35:11.485 --> 35:13.630
- Are you OK?
- What happened, why'd they pull you in?

35:13.655 --> 35:15.055
I'm fine.

35:15.641 --> 35:17.817
A neighbor saw me
coming out of the John's place.

35:18.723 --> 35:20.953
Oh, yeah?
Nice.

35:21.053 --> 35:24.120
Ray, the cops don't know shit.
They're in the dark as much as we are.

35:24.902 --> 35:27.748
- You sure it was an execution?
- Yeah.

35:29.539 --> 35:31.459
Then it is Massoud,
no doubt about it.

35:35.378 --> 35:36.778
What have we got?

35:38.750 --> 35:40.393
I hacked into the ME's report.

35:41.982 --> 35:43.965
The coke was cut with fentanyl.

35:44.675 --> 35:47.161
- What's fentanyl?
- It's an opiate.

35:47.704 --> 35:50.766
A pain killer. It's used to
treat terminal cancer patients.

35:51.230 --> 35:52.630
It's very potent.

35:53.475 --> 35:54.875
There's a lot of it going around.

35:54.996 --> 35:57.485
Yeah, you're going to kill a junkie?
How would you do it?

35:59.369 --> 36:01.903
I'd send over a party girl with
an eight ball of tainted blow.

36:01.991 --> 36:05.219
You'd expect them to both partake,
but only the junkie does.

36:08.254 --> 36:10.398
Kendra was Massoud,
tying up loose ends.

36:11.557 --> 36:14.494
- We're next.
- The only question is, when and...

36:15.444 --> 36:17.901
- where is he going to hit us?
- OK.

36:18.420 --> 36:21.065
Why don't you move your families.
Put them in a hotel.

36:23.075 --> 36:24.475
We're running?

36:25.854 --> 36:27.254
No.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.310
Downtown, somewhere safe.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.490
'Til we can figure out
what the fuck is going on.

36:35.045 --> 36:37.950
Hey, babe...
I know it's late, but uh... Listen.

36:38.050 --> 36:39.529
Shit never ends, does it?

36:39.898 --> 36:41.481
Sometimes I wish
I could go back.

36:43.555 --> 36:44.955
Undo it.

36:45.795 --> 36:47.820
Yeah, I wish the whole
thing never happened.

36:53.449 --> 36:56.190
I wish that whole fucking
country never happened.

36:57.685 --> 36:59.085
Yeah.

37:26.293 --> 37:27.693
Donna, let's go!

37:28.702 --> 37:31.358
- Why can't we go to my mother's?
- Because we can't, OK?

37:32.889 --> 37:35.742
I can't help you if you won't tell me
what's going on.

37:39.673 --> 37:43.753
Everything's going to be fine, OK?
I promise you. It's just a precaution.

37:46.385 --> 37:48.901
I would never do anything
to hurt you and Kyle.

37:49.190 --> 37:50.675
You know that.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.374
Did you know that Sarah
had two strikes against her?

38:05.273 --> 38:06.996
Disciplinary hearings.

38:07.924 --> 38:09.324
Did she tell you that?

38:10.448 --> 38:13.138
No.
It wasn't in her file.

38:14.254 --> 38:17.262
Well, she was working a case...
A murder.

38:18.371 --> 38:19.771
Grimaldi?

38:21.643 --> 38:23.825
And she was charged
with insubordination.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.208
Casner.

38:33.358 --> 38:34.758
Yeah.

38:36.663 --> 38:38.063
What do you got?

38:42.849 --> 38:45.660
OK, here we go.
Look at this place, this is fine.

38:45.760 --> 38:47.529
OK, kids. Time for bed.

38:48.686 --> 38:51.191
- Home away from home.
- She's tired.

38:51.391 --> 38:52.691
You like it here? Huh?

38:52.791 --> 38:54.472
- Sleepy girls.
- Want your bunny?

38:54.473 --> 38:56.265
- Come on. She's off.
- Yeah.

38:56.358 --> 38:57.758
Come on.

38:57.871 --> 38:59.747
OK. Let's get that off.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.390
It's OK, sweetie.

39:04.078 --> 39:07.022
Alright, there you go.
Sit over there with mommy.

39:10.153 --> 39:11.553
You OK?

39:13.460 --> 39:15.416
We're just going to be
in the next room, OK?

39:24.948 --> 39:26.713
That was my source
at the Pentagon.

39:27.612 --> 39:28.916
Ethan Kelly and his buddies

39:28.972 --> 39:31.744
were working private security,
based out of Karachi, Pakistan.

39:32.244 --> 39:36.297
They quit a year and a half ago. Two
months later they end up in Aswad Valley.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.090
That place makes
Syria look like Kansas.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.580
What were they doing there?

39:44.105 --> 39:46.580
Cheat was talking about
how hungover he was.

39:47.163 --> 39:48.603
Hungover? He always was.

39:50.691 --> 39:53.891
And you guys... Well, you know,
I had this terrible nightmare.

39:53.991 --> 39:56.281
That I stole a squad car
and I was being chased...

39:56.381 --> 39:58.781
through the city, New York City.
And I'm like going...

39:59.107 --> 40:01.341
But man, I woke up
in the afternoon.

40:01.441 --> 40:05.270
I get up, I go downstairs and I'm buying
some cigarettes or whatever, and there

40:05.370 --> 40:08.995
is a squad car, that is halfway
on the sidewalk.

40:10.494 --> 40:14.403
And then, so, the judge says,
"Well it's either Attica or the Army".

40:15.156 --> 40:17.776
- That's what he told you?
- Yeah, that's what he told me.

40:18.505 --> 40:21.177
He told me that he
enlisted because he had...

40:21.908 --> 40:24.998
He got his high school
English teacher pregnant.

40:25.310 --> 40:27.189
- That son of a bitch...
- No, no, hang on a minute.

40:27.289 --> 40:30.028
He told me he put an ounce of blow up
his nose back when he was dealing...

40:30.158 --> 40:31.907
he had to duck into a store
in order to get away

40:31.920 --> 40:33.679
from the crazy fucker he
was stealing from, right,

40:33.729 --> 40:37.300
only it wasn't a store.
It was a recruiting station.

40:38.467 --> 40:39.867
Right?

40:39.888 --> 40:43.075
- I mean, which is it?
- Who fucking knows.

40:44.963 --> 40:47.763
- Crazy fucking...
- Wow...

40:48.084 --> 40:50.815
Cheat was crazy, man.
I used to think, you know, his...

40:51.726 --> 40:54.356
his kind of insanity
would keep us all sane.

40:55.341 --> 40:57.849
And as you know, you know...
once you go to war...

40:58.851 --> 41:00.302
there's no more sanity.

41:05.081 --> 41:07.177
Sometimes you're trying
to help people and...

41:09.241 --> 41:11.153
there are times
you're trying to kill'em.

41:12.201 --> 41:15.465
Then soon enough, you know,
you start to realize that...

41:17.369 --> 41:19.369
those people that
you're trying to help...

41:21.940 --> 41:23.340
they're trying to kill you.

41:25.182 --> 41:28.803
And the longer it goes on, you know...
you just kind of stop giving a shit.

41:29.257 --> 41:31.385
Who you're helping
or who you're killing.

41:32.697 --> 41:34.097
It's all the same.

41:35.902 --> 41:37.513
As long as at the end
of the day, you know...

41:37.526 --> 41:39.147
God damn it, that we're...

41:39.198 --> 41:40.598
we're still breathing.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.198
Know what I mean?

41:44.491 --> 41:48.313
We bring in the best surveillance team,
we put them on Kelly, day and night.

41:48.613 --> 41:50.013
Oh, come on.

41:50.873 --> 41:52.916
He'll make them...
Guy's a pro.

41:58.878 --> 42:00.278
We have to send someone in.

42:16.009 --> 42:18.945
Why you wouldn't let me
interrogate him. Isn't it?

42:20.905 --> 42:22.305
You wanna find Sarah?

42:23.636 --> 42:25.036
You go in after her.

42:27.956 --> 42:29.379
And then you forget,
you know...

42:30.074 --> 42:31.274
why it is...

42:31.455 --> 42:33.056
that you're doing
what you're doing.

42:35.774 --> 42:37.582
And naturally, you're like, well...

42:39.060 --> 42:42.185
why'd I sign up in the first place?
Like, what am I doing?

42:43.358 --> 42:45.097
So you start thinking about...

42:46.014 --> 42:47.414
man, home...

42:51.257 --> 42:52.946
because that's
the only thing that...

42:53.177 --> 42:57.524
connects you to that tiny part inside that
still makes you feel goddamn human.

42:58.915 --> 43:01.497
But even then,
deep down, you're afraid.

43:03.747 --> 43:05.147
Because you worry about...

43:05.897 --> 43:08.057
what home
will be like after hell.

43:10.868 --> 43:15.011
You know, when you're guilty of,
like, these horrible things...

43:15.211 --> 43:18.601
you almost kind of feel like you're a...
a walking time bomb.

43:19.024 --> 43:20.424
Capable of anything.

43:21.545 --> 43:24.483
And the only thing that separates you
from madness...

43:26.516 --> 43:27.916
is friends.

43:32.969 --> 43:34.659
Just a few broken men.

43:36.073 --> 43:38.638
Just as lost and forgotten.

43:43.714 --> 43:45.114
Yeah.

43:48.852 --> 43:50.252
Yeah, Cheat.

44:05.641 --> 44:07.041
I'm going to go home.

44:08.012 --> 44:09.412
I'm going home.

44:13.465 --> 44:14.865
Grace.

44:15.435 --> 44:16.835
Grace.

44:18.027 --> 44:19.427
I need an answer.

44:20.852 --> 44:22.252
Will you do it?

46:25.746 --> 46:30.346
