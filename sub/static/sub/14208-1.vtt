00:31.701 --> 00:35.067
* You won't admit you love me *

00:35.133 --> 00:36.934
* And so *

00:37.000 --> 00:39.634

SUSAN!

01:03.267 --> 01:04.733
What?

01:06.334 --> 01:07.567
What?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.667
You know.

01:10.734 --> 01:15.834
No!...I don't.

02:18.601 --> 02:20.734
I was just wrong.

02:20.801 --> 02:23.634
Wrong about everything.

02:23.701 --> 02:27.234
Since you left me,I've come to see the point

02:27.300 --> 02:31.334
of cut flowers
and very small picture frames,

02:31.400 --> 02:33.901
And relatives.

02:33.968 --> 02:37.767
I'm thinking of owning more than one bar of soap at a time

02:37.834 --> 02:39.868
And buying another towel.

02:39.934 --> 02:43.267
and the stands to put the toilet roll on.

02:43.334 --> 02:47.300
And toilet roll, Even when I've got a newspaper.

02:49.634 --> 02:51.601
I now realize that my playstation

02:51.667 --> 02:55.000
is a complete waste of my life...

02:55.067 --> 02:57.701
and that a lack of realistic gore

02:57.767 --> 03:01.367
is not a sensible criticism of chess.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.467
I absolutely promise to abandon

03:06.534 --> 03:09.801
all of my disgusting sexual deviances

03:09.868 --> 03:14.834
Like lesbian porn,
MARIELLA FROSTRUP...

03:14.901 --> 03:17.534
and talking to other women.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.400
SUSAN...

03:22.467 --> 03:24.901
Please...

03:27.267 --> 03:29.734
( voice cracking )
just take me back.

03:36.868 --> 03:40.534
I found someone new,someone better.

03:40.601 --> 03:44.567
some who's gonna satisfy me in a way you never could,

03:44.634 --> 03:47.534
You sad pathetic little man.

03:47.601 --> 03:50.234
and I'm gonna make you watch.

03:52.334 --> 03:53.734
Hello, MARIELLA.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.067
Hello, SUSAN.

03:55.133 --> 03:57.300
Are you wearing really small pants?

03:57.367 --> 04:00.100
Oh, I always wear really small pants

04:00.167 --> 04:01.100
Me, too.

04:01.167 --> 04:03.033
Mine are absolutely tiny.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.334
You could swallow my entire pants collection

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
with one sip of water.

04:07.467 --> 04:09.267
Could I I? Thanks.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.100
Oh, look,there's GAIL PORTER.

04:16.567 --> 04:17.701
Let's have a foam party.

04:17.767 --> 04:18.901
Hi, GAIL.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.801
Are you wearing really tiny pants?

04:21.868 --> 04:24.067
Jeff: Excellent!

04:26.033 --> 04:28.234
Why do you always turn up in these dreams?

04:28.300 --> 04:31.434
It's a gift.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.834
Watch out,
MARIELLA's losing power.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.467
 <i>* PERHAPS, PERHAPS *</i>

04:39.534 --> 04:40.701
Leave now forever!

04:40.767 --> 04:41.767
SUSAN, I--

04:41.834 --> 04:43.267
and take your pathetic collection

04:43.334 --> 04:45.667
of dirty vieos with you!

04:48.267 --> 04:50.000
EXCELLENT!

04:51.033 --> 04:52.701
What are you doing here?

04:52.767 --> 04:54.667
Spooky, isn't it?

05:35.400 --> 05:38.067
Am I really supposed to be reading this?

05:38.133 --> 05:40.300
No, You're supposed to send it to Steve.

05:42.434 --> 05:43.701
Why?

05:43.767 --> 05:46.567
You've always got to send a man a book when you split up

05:46.634 --> 05:49.067
to prove how you're a caring, Giving person

05:49.133 --> 05:52.667
and how they're gonna die alone
in a pit of their own filth.

05:54.701 --> 05:57.067
 <i>A bridge across destiny</i>

05:57.133 --> 06:00.634
It's about soul mates,
fate, and why men are rubbish.

06:02.234 --> 06:03.367
Are you okay?

06:03.434 --> 06:05.534
Yeah, I-I'm fine.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.767
 <i>How to heal a man</i>

06:07.834 --> 06:08.868
That one's very useful.

06:08.934 --> 06:10.601
It clarifies to even the happiest man

06:10.667 --> 06:12.367
That, actually,he's miserable.

06:12.434 --> 06:13.801
Kill,Kill the dogs!

06:13.868 --> 06:14.901
Kill,Kill, Kill!

06:14.968 --> 06:16.868
( gunshots,dog groaning )

06:16.934 --> 06:19.334
Weren't you supposed to be getting some wine?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.434
It tells men the right things to be happy about

06:21.501 --> 06:23.834
Instead of sport and having fun.

06:23.901 --> 06:25.801
Wine!

06:25.868 --> 06:27.400
Now make her do the crawl action.

06:27.467 --> 06:28.901
She doesn't need to crawl.

06:28.968 --> 06:30.167
Trust me.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.968
( chuckles )

06:34.033 --> 06:35.834
wow!

06:39.701 --> 06:40.868
( rings briefly )

06:42.901 --> 06:44.634
Sally: Susan?

06:49.367 --> 06:51.934
Patrick:
Phoning Susan?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.400
Wasn't quite ready.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.501
Jeff: Yeah,I hate phoning.

06:55.567 --> 06:58.033
You never know who's gonna answer.

06:59.234 --> 07:00.334
What was that?

07:00.400 --> 07:01.434
Oh, nothing.

07:01.501 --> 07:02.834
But you do realize you're supposed

07:02.901 --> 07:05.534
to phone specific people, right?

07:05.601 --> 07:09.467
Yeah. but still,you know what it's like.

07:09.534 --> 07:11.734
Sally: i thought i heard the phone.

07:11.801 --> 07:14.934
It just sort of...chirped.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.100
Chirped?

07:17.367 --> 07:18.801
You phone someone,

07:18.868 --> 07:20.901
someone you know or a woman,

07:20.968 --> 07:25.434
and you don't know what's going on.

07:26.634 --> 07:28.067
A chirp, eh?

07:28.133 --> 07:30.334
There's nothing to analyze here, Sally.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.968
Jeff: You're just suddenly in the middle

07:32.033 --> 07:33.100
of someone's house,

07:33.167 --> 07:34.601
anything could be happening.

07:34.667 --> 07:37.534
There could be old people naked.

07:37.601 --> 07:39.334
You wouldn't be able to see them!

07:39.400 --> 07:41.734
Yeah, but they could be out there, rustling.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.133
but it could have been--

07:44.200 --> 07:45.667
Who knows?Who cares?

07:45.734 --> 07:47.067
It was a chirp.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.567
There's nothing you can tell from a chirp.

07:49.634 --> 07:51.300
Of course i know that. good.

07:51.367 --> 07:52.400
How long a chirp?

07:52.467 --> 07:54.367
Sally!

07:54.434 --> 07:56.467
Jeff: Jenny Turbot.

07:56.534 --> 07:57.701
I'm sorry?

07:57.767 --> 08:00.267
Worst phone call I ever made.

08:00.334 --> 08:01.834
Right.

08:01.901 --> 08:04.767
If this chirp was an animal...

08:04.834 --> 08:06.367
I mean it!

08:06.434 --> 08:08.501
Jeff: It was my final year at school,

08:08.567 --> 08:11.200
and there she was,JENNY TURBOT.

08:11.267 --> 08:12.667
It was like she'd come to life

08:12.734 --> 08:13.934
from one of my magazines,

08:14.000 --> 08:15.968
as if all the candles and the chanting

08:16.033 --> 08:17.567
had finally worked.

08:19.634 --> 08:23.701
I'd never seen a woman that gorgeous fully dressed.

08:23.767 --> 08:25.467
clothes looked wrong on her somehow

08:25.534 --> 08:28.267
as if she'd developed a fault.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.299
You know, you could--
don't say it!

08:32.366 --> 08:34.333
Jeff: I fell completely in love with her...

08:34.400 --> 08:35.366
totally.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.200
I knew she was the one.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.933
Everyone else called her "The school bike,"

08:39.000 --> 08:41.734
Said she'd put out for absolutely anyone,

08:41.801 --> 08:44.267
and it wasn't <i>just</i> that.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.033
And I got her phone number, right.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.000
It took me ages,but i got it.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.634
It was on a little scrap of paper,

08:51.701 --> 08:54.067
The turbot's actual phone number.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.567
That little scrap of paper

08:55.634 --> 08:57.767
gave me the best time of my life...

08:57.834 --> 09:01.467
a month of complete sexual bliss.

09:01.534 --> 09:05.100
in the end, i had to phone her before it fell apart.

09:05.167 --> 09:07.734
and she knew who i was!

09:07.801 --> 09:10.734
she remembered me.nobody ever remembered me.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.133
but the turbot,she remembered.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.934
and we were just chatting away,and it was easy.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.801
and i just asked her out.i just did it.

09:19.868 --> 09:22.000
an actual date.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.367
it wouldn't hurt--yes, it would!

09:26.434 --> 09:27.634
so what went wrong?

09:27.701 --> 09:30.467
well, her ex suddenly turns up again, doesn't he?

09:30.534 --> 09:33.968
barry.barry the bastard.

09:34.033 --> 09:35.167
before you know it,

09:35.234 --> 09:37.334
they're shagging away like maniacs.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.033
i kept asking her out,obviously, i pleaded,

09:40.100 --> 09:41.367
but she was too busy

09:41.434 --> 09:43.901
with all the endless shagging.

09:43.968 --> 09:47.501
so, in the end,i just had to hang up.

09:55.801 --> 09:57.901
she was having sex with this guy

09:57.968 --> 09:59.434
while you were still on the phone?

09:59.501 --> 10:02.400
actually, i think the phone was involved.

10:05.934 --> 10:09.067
oh, dear god!

10:09.133 --> 10:12.300
that was as close as i got to jenny turbot.

10:12.367 --> 10:16.734
i was a sex aid for her and barry the bastard.

10:17.968 --> 10:20.567
i counted it as half a point.

10:21.634 --> 10:23.501
i got phoned during sex once.

10:23.567 --> 10:25.701
can we please not hear about it.

10:25.767 --> 10:27.801
it's a bit embarrassing,actually.

10:27.868 --> 10:30.434
there i was, in the middle of serious, full-on sex,

10:30.501 --> 10:32.033
when my girlfriend phones.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.667
bloody hell!

10:34.734 --> 10:35.734
that's very embarrassing!

10:35.801 --> 10:37.033
she kept going on and on

10:37.100 --> 10:39.133
about how i was ignoring her.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.367
you don't think it was maybe

10:40.434 --> 10:42.400
because you were having sex with somebody else?

10:42.467 --> 10:44.501
no, no,i was having sex with her.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.567
shit!what?

10:51.634 --> 10:55.100
sally, no! that way madness lies.

10:55.167 --> 10:57.100
i didn't say anything that time.

10:57.167 --> 10:59.767
you just thought it.

10:59.834 --> 11:00.868
what's wrong?

11:00.934 --> 11:02.601
i connected.

11:02.667 --> 11:05.868
when i phoned susan--for a moment, i connected.

11:05.934 --> 11:07.634
shall we say it together?

11:07.701 --> 11:10.267
so?what do you mean, "so?"

11:10.334 --> 11:12.567
all five: 1471!

11:12.634 --> 11:14.767
what if she checks?she'll know it was me.

11:14.834 --> 11:15.968
well?

11:16.033 --> 11:18.100
what if she's there?what if she's about to--

11:18.167 --> 11:20.133
patrick, have you got your mobile?

11:20.200 --> 11:21.133
no.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.434
jeff?why?

11:25.067 --> 11:27.300
so you know,one way or the other.

11:27.367 --> 11:28.501
will you phone her?

11:28.567 --> 11:29.801
i don't want to phone her.

11:29.868 --> 11:30.801
jeff, please!forget it!

11:30.868 --> 11:32.434
you don't have to talk to her.

11:32.501 --> 11:33.501
i'm not talking to her.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.968
you're the ones who've split up.

11:35.033 --> 11:36.267
jeff!

11:36.334 --> 11:37.834
i don't talk to women when they're emotional.

11:37.901 --> 11:39.868
they're allowed to slap you.

11:39.934 --> 11:41.067
over the phone?

11:41.133 --> 11:42.300
well, she'll remember for next time.

11:42.367 --> 11:43.634
women remember, steve.

11:43.701 --> 11:45.834
it's like they've got minds of their own.

11:45.901 --> 11:47.400
you don't have to talk to her.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.467
you're gonna hang up the moment it rings.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.701
it's just so that i'm not the last one who phoned

11:51.767 --> 11:53.334
when she 1471's.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.634
it just seems like

11:54.701 --> 11:56.434
a really needy thing to do.

11:56.501 --> 11:57.767
i don't do needy.

11:57.834 --> 12:00.934
you're a woman.
needy is our golf.

12:03.434 --> 12:05.534
oh!
you see?

12:05.601 --> 12:06.901
it'll be me
that phoned.

12:06.968 --> 12:08.334
exactly.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.734
susan: what
does that mean?

12:09.801 --> 12:11.868
i don't know.
i didn't think it through.

12:12.868 --> 12:14.267
okay,
i'll do it.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.467
good man!

12:16.534 --> 12:17.701
okay,
i'll do it.

12:17.767 --> 12:18.734
that's my girl!

12:18.801 --> 12:19.868
do you need
the number?

12:19.934 --> 12:22.067
no, you still
got it on redial.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.868
( dialing number )

12:23.934 --> 12:24.934
( rings )

12:25.000 --> 12:26.267
oh!
oh!

12:26.334 --> 12:28.234
second chirp.
you have a second chirp.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.567
second chirp
on the radar.

12:33.234 --> 12:36.000
we don't know
it was him.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.834
why else would your phone
keep chirping?

12:37.901 --> 12:40.033
i don't know, maybe
it's having a good day.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.801
he's wanting to phone.
he's changing his mind.

12:41.868 --> 12:44.200
next time, try and answer
during the chirp.

12:44.267 --> 12:46.367
do you know why i'm not
gonna do this, sally?

12:46.434 --> 12:48.601
because i'm just not
that desperate.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.801
( knock on door )

12:52.868 --> 12:54.033
hello?!

13:06.234 --> 13:08.100
steve, you've made
a mistake.

13:10.133 --> 13:12.234
have i really?

13:13.934 --> 13:15.701
i'll get that,
shall i?

13:15.767 --> 13:17.400
it'll be your number
on the phone--

13:17.467 --> 13:20.701
you were supposed
to use your mobile!

13:22.267 --> 13:23.934
because, actually,
that was the door,

13:24.000 --> 13:25.100
not the phone.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.667
yes, sally,
i know.

13:27.734 --> 13:29.133
so i'll get it,
shall i?

13:29.200 --> 13:32.934
ah...right!

13:34.801 --> 13:37.601
i'll just go over...
here and get it.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.367
because this
is where the door is

13:39.434 --> 13:41.601
as opposed
to the telephone, do you see?

13:41.667 --> 13:43.200
sally!

13:43.267 --> 13:45.601
i don't have
my mobile with me.

13:45.667 --> 13:48.968
using my phone was not
the second best option.

13:49.033 --> 13:51.467
jane: hi, hi.
what's happening?

13:51.534 --> 13:52.567
has steve
phoned yet?

13:52.634 --> 13:53.868
sally: well...

13:53.934 --> 13:55.801
no phone calls,
just the occasional chirp.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.367
how long a chirp?

13:57.434 --> 13:59.767
well,
for god's sake!

13:59.834 --> 14:01.200
i brought you books.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.033
you might want
to send one to steve.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.367
 <i>bridge across destiny.</i>

14:05.434 --> 14:06.834
isn't it great?

14:06.901 --> 14:08.267
it's like a manual
for living

14:08.334 --> 14:10.334
that proves
men are wrong.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.634
no offense, but do
you know that your voice

14:12.701 --> 14:14.534
actually makes me
grind my teeth?

14:14.601 --> 14:16.601
none taken.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.934
 <i>50 ways to make him</i>
 <i>your soul mate.</i>

14:19.000 --> 14:20.367
oh, this one's
fabulous.

14:20.434 --> 14:23.200
it's like the citizen's arrest
of romance.

14:23.267 --> 14:25.767
can you hear them,
jane, grinding away?

14:25.834 --> 14:28.234
do you know,
i think i can.

14:29.467 --> 14:30.801
patrick: why don't you
phone her back

14:30.868 --> 14:31.868
and withhold
your number?

14:31.934 --> 14:33.367
yeah, that'd work.

14:33.434 --> 14:36.000
susan: come on, jane,
let's get you a drink.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.300
i mean, it's not that i
don't like you or anything,

14:38.367 --> 14:41.067
it's just that i'm developing
extra muscles in my jaw.

14:41.133 --> 14:43.701
we'll leave susan to do
whatever she feels she has to.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.667
how would i
withhold my number?

14:45.734 --> 14:47.701
you've never withheld
your number?

14:47.767 --> 14:48.968
why would i?

14:49.033 --> 14:50.667
oh, you know...

14:52.400 --> 14:54.033
purposes.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.667
exactly.

14:57.734 --> 15:00.934
okay. how do i
do it, then?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.200
141.
brilliant.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.801
when do i do
the 141?

15:06.868 --> 15:07.934
jeff: first.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.334
( telephone rings )
oh!

15:10.968 --> 15:12.400
incoming!

15:12.467 --> 15:14.267
jane:
i'm excited, too!

15:14.334 --> 15:16.000
okay, i don't know
what he's playing at,

15:16.067 --> 15:17.300
but i'm just not
joining in.

15:17.367 --> 15:20.534
first?
first, yeah.

15:20.601 --> 15:21.934
sally: don't you
want to at least--

15:22.000 --> 15:23.267
no, i don't!

15:23.334 --> 15:27.767
look, just to set
your mind at rest...

15:27.834 --> 15:30.367
1471.

15:30.434 --> 15:31.968
susan: how do i
delete the number?

15:32.033 --> 15:33.067
three.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.734
oh, no,
that's the messages.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.334
three calls
the number.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.200
( telephone rings )
men: aah!

15:39.701 --> 15:41.133
bollocks!

15:41.200 --> 15:42.400
jeff:
they're on to us!

15:45.100 --> 15:46.801
bollocks,
bollocks, bollocks!

15:46.868 --> 15:49.868
they know exactly
where we are!

15:49.934 --> 15:51.667
he'll know
it was me!

15:51.734 --> 15:53.167
he'll 1471!

15:53.234 --> 15:54.734
jeff,
she's my girlfriend.

15:54.801 --> 15:56.534
she already knows
where i live.

15:56.601 --> 15:58.701
ex-girlfriend.

15:58.767 --> 16:00.567
and which part
of your brain

16:00.634 --> 16:04.267
thought that that would be
a good thing to say?

16:04.334 --> 16:07.300
jane: okay, i've got a plan
to get us out of this.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.634
sally and i just go.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.033
how does that
help me?

16:10.100 --> 16:12.267
it doesn't. i had
to leave you out of the plan.

16:12.334 --> 16:15.000
oh, thanks!
oh, great!

16:15.067 --> 16:16.667
come on.
wait!

16:16.734 --> 16:17.667
sally: what?

16:17.734 --> 16:19.033
where are
we going?

16:19.100 --> 16:20.467
steve: i'm a man
who's been dumped,

16:20.534 --> 16:21.901
you know where
we're going.

16:21.968 --> 16:23.501
susan:
i'm coming with you.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.601
sally:
what if he phones?

16:24.667 --> 16:25.901
i don't care
if he phones.

16:25.968 --> 16:27.067
come on,
let's go.

16:27.133 --> 16:28.167
hang on.

16:28.234 --> 16:29.334
susan:
what are you doing?

16:29.400 --> 16:30.968
just checking
your answerphone's on.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.133
jane: oh, yeah.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.868
susan: jane?

16:33.934 --> 16:35.968
just checking you
hung up properly.

16:36.033 --> 16:37.868
oh! oh!

16:40.968 --> 16:42.133
oh.

16:46.534 --> 16:48.400
let's just
risk it.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.734
okay.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.033
it's like checking
your fridge light

16:51.100 --> 16:52.901
really goes off,
isn't it?

16:54.467 --> 16:55.767
yeah, i expect so.

16:55.834 --> 16:58.734
there's a whole night
of my life i want back.

17:04.567 --> 17:05.834
patrick:
so where are we going?

17:05.901 --> 17:07.767
steve: the temple of woman.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.099
sally: so where
are we going?

17:09.166 --> 17:11.901
susan: the temple of woman.

17:21.067 --> 17:23.067
( dance music playing )

17:40.334 --> 17:42.067
do you think this
is the sort of place

17:42.133 --> 17:43.634
that degrades women?

17:44.701 --> 17:47.267
we could ask.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.901
i'm sure someone else
has been using my neck.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.501
your neck's fine.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.100
this is terrifying!

17:54.167 --> 17:55.667
terrifying?

17:55.734 --> 17:58.167
i think it's started
to make noises when i move it.

17:58.234 --> 18:00.567
do you think i have
an audible neck?

18:00.634 --> 18:03.300
lap dancing is
the ultimate nightmare of man.

18:03.367 --> 18:08.200
i mean...it's porn
that can see you.

18:08.267 --> 18:09.834
excellent.

18:09.901 --> 18:11.734
when i was a kid
i used to imagine

18:11.801 --> 18:14.767
that the girls in
my magazines could see me.

18:14.834 --> 18:17.701
they were shouting,
"pervert, pervert!"

18:17.767 --> 18:18.934
yeah?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.868
yeah. but you get
bored of that.

18:24.367 --> 18:26.901
some people think
that external beauty

18:26.968 --> 18:28.901
comes from
inner tranquility.

18:28.968 --> 18:30.901
of course, some people
think it comes

18:30.968 --> 18:32.601
from drinking
the blood of virgins,

18:32.667 --> 18:35.801
so there's quite
a range there.

18:35.868 --> 18:37.534
you know what
my neck needs?

18:37.601 --> 18:39.334
to be left alone.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.234
you've already got
enough products on you

18:41.300 --> 18:43.133
to make a spare woman.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.300
if anti-aging cream
actually worked,

18:45.367 --> 18:47.567
you'd be
back in puberty.

18:49.234 --> 18:51.234
so why are
we here, then?

18:51.300 --> 18:56.267
i'm single, i need
to look at naked women.

18:56.334 --> 18:57.567
if that's
what you think,

18:57.634 --> 18:58.868
then why are we here?

18:58.934 --> 19:02.267
i'm single.
i need to look good naked.

19:05.534 --> 19:06.901
steve!

19:06.968 --> 19:08.300
what, what's
the matter?

19:08.367 --> 19:10.434
it's her!

19:10.501 --> 19:11.501
what?

19:11.567 --> 19:14.901
the turbot.
jenny turbot.

19:14.968 --> 19:16.300
hello, boys.

19:16.367 --> 19:18.234
hi.
hello.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.400
hello.

19:19.467 --> 19:21.634
so would you
like a dance?

19:21.701 --> 19:24.067
oh, i'm not
a very good dancer.

19:25.434 --> 19:27.434
i think the idea is
i do the dancing.

19:27.501 --> 19:30.467
oh, right.
that's probably better.

19:30.534 --> 19:32.667
probably, yes.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.834
so do you guys
want to sit down?

19:34.901 --> 19:35.934
jenny?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.200
yes.

19:37.267 --> 19:39.734
it's me!

19:39.801 --> 19:41.200
i'm sorry?

19:41.267 --> 19:44.167
jeff. jeff murdock.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.701
we were
at school together.

19:47.767 --> 19:51.334
oh, my god!
scary jeff?

19:51.400 --> 19:54.167
you see?
she remembers me!

19:54.234 --> 19:55.834
the turbot
remembers me!

19:55.901 --> 19:57.300
well done.
scary.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.634
this is steve
and this is patrick.

19:59.701 --> 20:02.067
so what are
you guys doing here?

20:02.133 --> 20:05.901
oh, we come here strictly
for the articles.

20:05.968 --> 20:08.000
this is amazing!

20:08.067 --> 20:10.734
i can't believe
it's you!

20:10.801 --> 20:13.801
do you remember that time
you called me up?

20:13.868 --> 20:15.601
that was wild.

20:15.667 --> 20:19.200
yeah, i was just telling
the boys about it.

20:19.267 --> 20:21.067
the only time a guy's
ever phoned me.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.501
oh, i'm sure
that's not true.

20:22.567 --> 20:25.601
no, jeff, the only time
a guy's ever...

20:25.667 --> 20:28.234
phoned me.

20:31.901 --> 20:34.601
s-s-s-so what are
you doing these days?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.868
i dance naked
for men.

20:36.934 --> 20:37.934
right!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.901
great!
nice!

20:39.968 --> 20:42.200
my mother says it's
one step from prostitution.

20:42.267 --> 20:44.334
well, you're
practically there, then.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.701
well, no,
i mean, um...

20:45.767 --> 20:47.534
do you guys want
to come and sit down?

20:47.601 --> 20:49.200
great, thanks.

20:52.601 --> 20:55.367
so do you ever see
anyone from school?

20:55.434 --> 20:57.868
well, the teachers,
obviously.

20:59.234 --> 21:01.400
so what do you
want done, then?

21:01.467 --> 21:04.567
oh, her eyes.

21:04.634 --> 21:06.067
i was talking to susan,
actually.

21:06.133 --> 21:07.467
what's wrong
with my eyes?

21:07.534 --> 21:09.300
nothing.
they're lovely eyes.

21:09.367 --> 21:10.667
it's just sometimes
you look

21:10.734 --> 21:13.000
like you've been
possessed by aliens.

21:14.634 --> 21:16.033
do you have
anything for that?

21:16.100 --> 21:18.300
okay, there's
that voice again.

21:18.367 --> 21:19.300
susan...

21:19.367 --> 21:20.868
can you hear them
grinding, jane?

21:20.934 --> 21:22.734
just talk and watch
my neck inflate.

21:22.801 --> 21:24.334
okay.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.901
oh, for christ's sake.

21:26.968 --> 21:28.400
do you want
to talk about it?

21:28.467 --> 21:30.534
no, sally, i want
to scream about it.

21:30.601 --> 21:33.067
there's a subtle,
yet important, distinction.

21:33.133 --> 21:34.100
susan.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.734
jane, one of these days,

21:35.801 --> 21:37.234
you're gonna start
a sentence to me,

21:37.300 --> 21:39.300
and my teeth
will just explode.

21:39.367 --> 21:40.834
people will die
in the blast.

21:40.901 --> 21:43.901
well...

21:43.968 --> 21:46.734
that's very pressuring,
actually.

21:56.167 --> 21:58.634
okay, you know what's
really getting me mad?

21:58.701 --> 22:01.100
my boyfriend,
my fiance,

22:01.167 --> 22:03.000
the man who, against
all my better judgment,

22:03.067 --> 22:04.234
i actually love,

22:04.300 --> 22:06.534
chatted up a woman
in a bar.

22:06.601 --> 22:09.701
and, on the very same day,
the very same day,

22:09.767 --> 22:11.767
i chatted up a man.

22:11.834 --> 22:13.634
do you see?
do you get it?

22:13.701 --> 22:16.467
i'm equally at fault.

22:16.534 --> 22:19.000
how can i ever
forgive him for that?

22:19.067 --> 22:21.501
well, of course, i'm not
going to forgive him because,

22:21.567 --> 22:23.701
because men--and i
don't mean to generalize--

22:23.767 --> 22:25.234
are crap!

22:26.501 --> 22:29.133
they're the human race's
only failed gender.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.167
who needs them?

22:31.234 --> 22:34.033
and why are they so difficult
to keep hold of?

22:35.334 --> 22:36.968
do you think
they realize

22:37.033 --> 22:38.868
that were it not
for the genetic imperative

22:38.934 --> 22:40.367
to populate the earth,

22:40.434 --> 22:42.100
they wouldn't
get a date?

22:42.167 --> 22:43.300
that's one hell
of an inducement--

22:43.367 --> 22:44.968
no pressure, girls,
but shag one of these

22:45.033 --> 22:46.868
or it's curtains
for all human kind.

22:46.934 --> 22:48.834
that's harassment.

22:50.234 --> 22:51.601
but, you know what?

22:51.667 --> 22:55.200
do you know what's
even more crap than men?

22:55.267 --> 22:57.467
 <i>we</i> are more crap
than men.

22:57.534 --> 23:00.234
all those stupid books
you guys had

23:00.300 --> 23:02.767
and, and these magazines.

23:02.834 --> 23:06.100
a hundred pages of
"men are useless bastards"

23:06.167 --> 23:07.601
and an article
about why you should

23:07.667 --> 23:09.133
wake him up
with a blow job.

23:10.501 --> 23:13.400
am i alone in spotting
the inconsistency here?

23:13.467 --> 23:15.434
and these places...

23:15.501 --> 23:17.334
because, for god's sake,
don't let them see

23:17.400 --> 23:18.634
what we really
look like.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.167
just let them
enjoy the results.

23:20.234 --> 23:22.434
don't let them see
how it all happens.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.100
you know,
i went out with steve

23:24.167 --> 23:25.200
for six years and...

23:25.267 --> 23:26.400
no, you didn't.

23:26.467 --> 23:29.033
you went out with him
for four years, i checked.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.634
oh. well,
it seemed longer.

23:32.701 --> 23:35.534
yeah, yeah, of course
it seemed longer.

23:35.601 --> 23:37.300
i, myself, have been
going out with him

23:37.367 --> 23:40.734
since the 12th century
or possibly since last week,

23:40.801 --> 23:42.067
it's hard
to keep track.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.734
because how are you
supposed to measure time

23:43.801 --> 23:46.534
with the man you want to spend
the rest of your life with?

23:46.601 --> 23:47.667
what would make sense?

23:47.734 --> 23:50.467
centuries?
nanoseconds?

23:52.234 --> 23:54.167
eggs.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
( laughing
and shouting )

25:01.868 --> 25:03.534
( glass shattering )

25:23.000 --> 25:25.501
( buzzing lips )

25:26.501 --> 25:28.100
( belches )

25:29.400 --> 25:30.801
shh!

25:38.434 --> 25:40.133
ooh!
all right, mate?

25:40.200 --> 25:41.467
naked women.

25:41.534 --> 25:43.167
yeah, fine.

25:43.234 --> 25:48.300
we'd better, um, uh...

25:48.367 --> 25:50.133
go.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.767
jeff: naked women,
naked, naked women,

25:52.834 --> 25:55.901
naked, naked women,
naked women, naked.

25:55.968 --> 25:57.200
see you.

25:58.634 --> 25:59.834
naked.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.100
answerphone: <i>hi, it's susan,</i>
 <i>leave a message.</i>

26:17.167 --> 26:19.000
 <i>you have</i>
 <i>one new message.</i>

26:19.067 --> 26:20.067
 <i>( beep )</i>

26:20.133 --> 26:21.767
( drunkenly )
i love you.

26:21.834 --> 26:27.200
i'm really sorry,
and i really...love you.

26:27.267 --> 26:31.234
and, also,
i'm sorry.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.601
and, also,
i-i-i love you.

26:34.667 --> 26:37.734
oh, please
come back to me.

26:37.801 --> 26:38.801
( sighs )

26:38.868 --> 26:40.534
if you don't
come back to me,

26:40.601 --> 26:43.534
please,
never play me this tape.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.367
( groans )

26:59.501 --> 27:01.267
oh, well...

27:02.367 --> 27:05.033
why not,
i suppose.

27:16.133 --> 27:19.167
sorry, mate.
got a bit lost.

27:19.234 --> 27:21.300
we've been
in the kitchen.

27:21.367 --> 27:23.434
naked women.

27:23.501 --> 27:25.367
mind if we crash here?

27:25.434 --> 27:27.234
whatever.

27:28.467 --> 27:31.133
( kissing noises )

27:36.467 --> 27:39.367
( moans )

27:46.667 --> 27:49.434
( moaning )

27:56.968 --> 27:58.834
( telephone rings )

27:59.968 --> 28:02.100
( rings )

28:03.334 --> 28:04.968
( rings )

28:06.267 --> 28:07.801
( rings )

28:09.534 --> 28:11.367
 <i>hi, this is steve,</i>
 <i>leave a message.</i>

28:11.434 --> 28:14.501
 <i>hi, steve, it's jane. </i>

28:14.567 --> 28:17.200
aah!!!

28:20.267 --> 28:22.200
i'm sorry.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.801
i'll be fine.

28:24.868 --> 28:27.300
it's jane's voice.

28:27.367 --> 28:29.501
doesn't it set
 <i>your</i> teeth on edge?

28:31.534 --> 28:33.501
it will now.

28:37.834 --> 28:40.667
* if you can't
make your mind up *

28:40.734 --> 28:43.000
* we'll never *

28:43.067 --> 28:45.968
* get started *

28:47.167 --> 28:49.634
* and i don't
want to wind up *

28:49.701 --> 28:55.534
* being parted,
broken-hearted *

28:55.601 --> 28:58.834
* so, if you
really love me *

28:58.901 --> 29:00.767
* say yes *

29:00.834 --> 29:03.334
* and please don't tell me *

29:03.400 --> 29:04.334
* perhaps, perhaps, perhaps *
