Why are you delivering

02:21.141 --> 02:23.795
Well, the post office
was pretty busy,

02:23.926 --> 02:27.756
so I said to myself, Timmy,
what could you do to help?

02:27.886 --> 02:29.366
And then I realized,

02:29.497 --> 02:31.890
who knows everybody
in Friendly Falls?

02:32.021 --> 02:34.284
Who always wanted to be
