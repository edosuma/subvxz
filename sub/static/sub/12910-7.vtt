01:52.498 --> 01:55.898
They should be dusted thoroughly.

01:55.978 --> 01:59.538
-Hello.
-Hey, Giacobone.

01:59.618 --> 02:02.738
Franco, give me a month.

02:02.818 --> 02:06.138
They want to move.

02:06.218 --> 02:11.058
Giacobone, why have you
need a month?

02:11.138 --> 02:14.738
Come on ...

02:27.658 --> 02:32.458
I go to bed. Good night, Dad.

03:06.418 --> 03:10.378
<i> -Mom, it's Genny. </ i>
-How are you?</i>

03:10.458 --> 03:14.058
<i> -"Celebration" went well. </ i>
-When are you coming?</i>

03:14.138 --> 03:19.258
<i> I'm in the jungle among the animals. </ i>
They are worse than gypsies.</i>

03:19.338 --> 03:22.698
Yes? They liked "gift"?

03:22.778 --> 03:27.778
<i> -They did not get it. </ i>
-It's from the "Thousand and One Nights".</i>

03:27.858 --> 03:31.698
<i> -"Thousand and One Nights" </ i>
-Yes.</i>

03:31.778 --> 03:36.338
<i> -Non thousand and three hundred </ i>
-They have never had one before.</i>

03:36.418 --> 03:40.338
<i> -They let me go. </ i>
-A thousand, not more.</i>

03:40.418 --> 03:45.698
<i> What do you say? </ i>
Can you believe they let me go?</i>

03:57.458 --> 04:01.058
Wait. Maria, can you stop?

04:26.338 --> 04:29.738
Are you with me?

04:29.818 --> 04:33.618
Do you want it? Come on.

04:33.698 --> 04:38.498
Come with me.
Do not be afraid of me.

04:41.738 --> 04:47.578
Do you have a name?
Or should we baptize you?

04:52.338 --> 04:55.498
Or should we baptize you?

04:58.338 --> 05:03.098
I have something
important to say to all of you.

05:03.178 --> 05:08.778
-The first shipment is on the way.
-Should not we wait for Ciro?

05:09.618 --> 05:13.378
Ciro is not invited.

05:13.458 --> 05:19.018
If the price is in euros per gram.
The quality and the journey goes well--

05:19.098 --> 05:23.978
-We can lower the price by 20%.

05:24.058 --> 05:29.058
20%? Are you sure?
So we all get to us.

05:30.018 --> 05:37.018
The risk we must run. We need
new places, the police do not know.

05:37.098 --> 05:41.258
We must be
dedicated and kind to people--

05:41.338 --> 05:45.738
-So the street again
is filled with junkies and police.

05:45.818 --> 05:52.458
Then open the door for the ladies police.

05:52.538 --> 05:57.178
Quiet, donna Imma.
We can always find new places.

05:57.258 --> 06:01.498
-I sent one of the boys.
-We go together.

06:13.578 --> 06:16.858
-Can we talk?
-Not now, Ciro.

06:16.938 --> 06:22.418
-Should I not at the meeting?
-Wait.

06:23.298 --> 06:26.618
Relax.

06:27.578 --> 06:33.258
-I have a suggestion.
-I'd like to hear.

06:33.338 --> 06:38.858
Good. You will hear from me.
Come beautiful.

06:44.858 --> 06:47.138
That's it.

06:49.018 --> 06:52.618
-Here it is.
-It's fine.

06:52.698 --> 06:55.178
Like it?

06:55.258 --> 07:01.098
We are guaranteed this place.
I know people here.

07:01.178 --> 07:06.738
Do all the cellars?
They are empty and will not be used.

07:06.818 --> 07:10.618
We take them and put guards there.

07:10.698 --> 07:15.898
Some of the balconies and the roof.
Police get us never.

07:15.978 --> 07:19.098
It is a fortress, donna Imma.

07:19.178 --> 07:22.538
-Sorry. Imma Savastano?
-Yes.

07:22.618 --> 07:28.138
A pleasure, I'm Luca Giacobone.
Can we talk?

07:31.898 --> 07:37.978
What a beautiful view.
It has an interesting views.

07:40.378 --> 07:44.138
What would you talk to me about?

07:44.218 --> 07:47.578
Go ahead and sit down.

07:48.378 --> 07:53.698
Do you know Franco Martucci?
He called Leccalecca.

07:53.778 --> 07:59.018
-Loan Shark? I know him.
-My father had wedding dress shop.

07:59.098 --> 08:01.898
It went badly.

08:01.978 --> 08:06.898
Leccalecca lent him 20,000 euros.
Now he will have interest.

08:06.978 --> 08:11.258
After three months,
it was 70,000 euros.

08:11.338 --> 08:15.178
Two weeks ago
he shot himself in the head.

08:15.258 --> 08:19.258
Everyone knows who you are.

08:19.338 --> 08:23.098
Therefore, I ask for help.

08:24.738 --> 08:31.418
-What do you think I can do?
-Tell him that we do not have the money.

08:45.378 --> 08:48.218
-Signora Imma.
-Franco.

08:48.298 --> 08:52.658
Has something happened?
What do I owe the honor?

08:52.738 --> 08:57.738
-Nothing in particular. Can I sit?
-Here you go.

08:57.818 --> 09:03.058
I come on behalf of a girl.
She lost her father recently.

09:03.138 --> 09:07.578
-His name was Giacobone.
-I know who it is.

09:07.658 --> 09:12.618
She is a disgusting and filthy dyke.

09:12.698 --> 09:18.058
The father was a desperate dog
who had no control over the money.

09:18.138 --> 09:21.418
He owed me 70,000 euros.

09:21.498 --> 09:27.338
And he thought
that death is canceled debt.

09:27.418 --> 09:31.098
But no.

09:31.178 --> 09:37.178
How much interest run on?

09:37.258 --> 09:40.378
First it was 50%.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.218
Then it was 70%.

09:44.978 --> 09:48.098
70%?

09:49.498 --> 09:52.738
Is that how you work?

09:52.818 --> 09:58.458
We are risking jail
and you earn money from it.

10:01.418 --> 10:08.058
Listen carefully, Leccalecca.
I say this only once.

10:08.138 --> 10:11.818
Now there are new rules.

10:12.578 --> 10:15.458
Do you understand?

10:34.058 --> 10:38.458
-Hello.
-Hey, Ciro. I have good news.

10:38.538 --> 10:43.338
-Finally.
-You will be responsible for the new trading post.

10:43.418 --> 10:47.698
-Is it a place?
-This is your big moment.

10:47.778 --> 10:52.938
-It's something for the boys.
-So help of the boys.

10:53.018 --> 10:57.258
I think I deserve better.

10:57.338 --> 11:01.938
It is the best I have now.

11:02.018 --> 11:06.138
You have two days to open the site.

11:08.258 --> 11:13.538
-Do you think about it?
-See you.

11:26.218 --> 11:29.578
-What did she say?
-Gennaro is coming soon.

11:29.658 --> 11:33.778
The bitch ruin everything.

11:49.818 --> 11:55.378
-What happened?
-I'm dead if I do not pay.

12:01.578 --> 12:08.458
Is not some nice glasses?
American from the NATO base.

12:08.538 --> 12:12.698
-Do you like them?
-There he is.

12:26.138 --> 12:30.218
Signora Imma,
you can not do this to me.

12:30.298 --> 12:33.898
I'm not one of your boys.

12:33.978 --> 12:39.218
Want to see what they can do to you,
Franco Leccalecca?

12:40.658 --> 12:44.218
Come on.

12:44.298 --> 12:47.458
Got a light, Zecchinetta?

12:49.738 --> 12:52.018
-Hello.
-Hello.

12:52.098 --> 12:57.498
-Mother. He borrows our window a bit.
-Why?

12:57.578 --> 13:02.498
-Immacolata Savastano sent me.
-What are you?

13:02.578 --> 13:07.858
Sorry, I take a chair
and put me here.

13:07.938 --> 13:10.618
-The delicious.
-Yes.

13:10.698 --> 13:15.058
-One of the boys can do it.
-Thank you, maybe.

13:15.138 --> 13:22.178
What a view. It is as Posillipo.
You can clearly see if the police come.

13:22.258 --> 13:27.258
There is change in six hours.
May I have a cup of coffee, please?

13:29.738 --> 13:33.138
Can you hear me?

13:33.218 --> 13:35.538
All clear.

16:40.338 --> 16:44.378
Marta, they are beautiful.

16:44.458 --> 16:47.458
Dad had good taste.

16:47.538 --> 16:53.418
-Why do you want of them?
-Mom does not call his foot here.

16:53.498 --> 16:57.818
-Why do not you work here?
-I? Never.

16:57.898 --> 17:02.658
It was the dream,
that killed the father.

17:02.738 --> 17:05.938
Okay, so.

17:06.578 --> 17:10.858
So mom will find a buyer.

17:10.938 --> 17:14.978
-We find the one that will buy.
-Thank you.

17:19.978 --> 17:23.377
You can not get past.

17:23.458 --> 17:27.018
Get off, you have to go.

17:34.658 --> 17:37.658
Okay.

17:45.538 --> 17:50.058
-Wait here. Go out.

17:53.738 --> 17:56.338
Break out the hand.

18:04.618 --> 18:06.738
Faster.

18:06.818 --> 18:10.658
So wait, however. Shut up.

18:12.738 --> 18:18.258
Come here. Shut. Give me the money.

18:19.058 --> 18:24.098
-Be careful. The police come after you.
-I'll show him ...

18:24.178 --> 18:27.738
In driving me crazy.

18:27.818 --> 18:32.258
You keep your mouth shut. People sleep.

18:34.018 --> 18:37.498
-Faster.
-Easy, Ciro.

18:45.538 --> 18:49.058
-Open.
-Come on.

18:49.858 --> 18:53.778
Be careful with money. Close.

18:58.098 --> 18:59.858
So.

19:02.218 --> 19:04.818
Wait.

19:07.338 --> 19:12.578
They need to shut up.
They need to shut up.

19:17.898 --> 19:22.738
Who is it? Stop that.
Away with your hands.

19:22.818 --> 19:26.898
I'll kick your ass. Shut up.

19:29.178 --> 19:32.618
Open the door. Fast

19:48.338 --> 19:51.658
Ciro. Do not worry.

20:07.778 --> 20:10.858
-You know what happened last night?
-No.

20:10.938 --> 20:15.178
Some smashed Madonna statue.

20:15.258 --> 20:18.218
Take it easy. I'll take care of it.

20:18.298 --> 20:24.818
No. This time
it is best that I intervene.

20:24.898 --> 20:29.018
I have something important to say.

20:29.098 --> 20:34.258
-Have you heard from Genny?
-It's too dangerous to talk to him.

20:34.338 --> 20:39.458
But we have found
body of a man down there.

20:43.338 --> 20:47.458
-Do you know who this is?
-Only that there was a white man.

20:47.538 --> 20:51.218
And the body had been dismembered.

20:54.498 --> 21:00.898
I think they're bluffing. They do not get
something out of breaking the agreement.

21:02.098 --> 21:08.298
What do you think?
Should we change the offer?

21:10.618 --> 21:16.058
No. Bid remains the same.

21:21.498 --> 21:24.938
All clear.

21:51.338 --> 21:54.018
Come on.

22:04.658 --> 22:10.458
Hello, donna Imma.
Come and see what has happened.

22:12.058 --> 22:15.178
-Hello.
-Hello.

22:15.258 --> 22:21.578
We have no idea what to do.
Look what they did to Madonna.

22:21.658 --> 22:26.978
-Help us donna Imma.
-Tomorrow, In a new statue.

22:27.058 --> 22:30.058
Okay? See you.

22:30.138 --> 22:36.458
I want you to meet
my daughter. Do you follow?

22:36.538 --> 22:41.138
Yeah, let's go. Come on, baby.

22:44.898 --> 22:48.698
-We need to talk.
-About what?

22:48.778 --> 22:52.378
I have receipts with.

22:52.458 --> 22:58.898
<i> -Do you have them with me </ i>
-If you want them, they are there.</i>

23:03.818 --> 23:06.498
-This is my daughter.
-Hello.

23:07.738 --> 23:09.778
Wait here.

23:09.978 --> 23:12.898
She made it here.

23:12.978 --> 23:19.498
We need to find a job for her.
She would really like to work.

23:19.578 --> 23:24.138
-You can probably find something.
-I will.

23:26.618 --> 23:31.858
-Move you a little bit.
-Now comes the dessert.

23:31.938 --> 23:38.818
-Tell Imma that we share the money.
-She says it does not have to be crazy.

23:38.898 --> 23:43.418
There will be two thousand people.
We are fifteen.

23:43.498 --> 23:49.658
-I'm just saying what she said.
-Say we want a bonus.

23:49.738 --> 23:52.778
-Not now.
-What's your name?

23:52.858 --> 23:57.378
-Luca.
-Are you a girl or a boy?

23:57.458 --> 24:01.778
-Do you have a knob?
-Yours is probably small.

24:01.858 --> 24:06.618
-Do you feel it?
-Spare me the bullshit and remember ...

24:06.698 --> 24:10.378
... That manliness
sitting here and not there.

24:11.058 --> 24:17.058
-Can not you shut up?
-Hurry up, I do not want more.

24:17.698 --> 24:24.858
-We need to do it properly.
-Get my car. I'm coming soon.

24:24.938 --> 24:29.338
No need to say, we are problems.
Do you understand, Toni?

24:29.418 --> 24:34.018
Above all, we must not
have a commotion that night.

24:34.098 --> 24:38.658
Do not have a helmet on the scooter--

24:38.738 --> 24:44.298
-And the car you have your hands on the wheel
and the lights on. Always.

24:44.378 --> 24:47.418
Have you understood Trak?

25:43.418 --> 25:48.138
They would kill me.

25:48.218 --> 25:52.858
-Ciro, we are with you.
-They do not like competition.

25:52.938 --> 25:56.058
Relax.

25:56.138 --> 26:02.178
-I can go alone in the war.
-It is not intended for you.

26:02.258 --> 26:08.538
-You do not worry, I see.
-What do you see? What do you mean?

26:08.618 --> 26:12.578
Do you really think
that it was about you?

26:12.658 --> 26:17.658
Ciro di Marzio, they do not care
you. Do you understand that?

26:17.738 --> 26:23.458
They do not care about us.
With the whole family Savastano.

26:23.538 --> 26:30.218
Yes, but we can not be complacent.
We must turn back hard.

26:30.298 --> 26:34.658
-It was Martoni, these assholes.
-I know them.

26:34.738 --> 26:38.418
-I and Rosario takes them.
-Malamore do it.

26:38.498 --> 26:43.778
-I'd be.
-You do as I say.

26:43.858 --> 26:49.458
Go and watch the business.
The meeting is over.

26:49.538 --> 26:52.938
Come on, Mary.

27:38.418 --> 27:41.778
See, Mary loves you.

27:41.858 --> 27:46.658
See her light on earth

27:46.738 --> 27:51.498

27:51.578 --> 27:56.498
and carry it on your way

27:56.578 --> 28:00.978

28:34.698 --> 28:39.298

28:58.858 --> 29:03.378

29:03.458 --> 29:07.498
all your great love

29:10.058 --> 29:13.858
-This team is ready now.
-We are late.

29:13.938 --> 29:18.618
-They are ready. Business is bad.
-What a fucking chaos.

29:18.698 --> 29:22.218
-Go now.
-Goodbye.

29:23.298 --> 29:29.378
No noise during the procession.
But we must work carefully.

30:05.698 --> 30:11.418
-Can not sleep?
-Oh yes, I can.

30:12.458 --> 30:15.578
I'm just a little tired.

30:15.658 --> 30:20.378
-You look worn out.
-Oh no ...

30:20.458 --> 30:26.938
I'm just worried about Genny.
You know your son.

30:27.778 --> 30:33.218
I do not know what he
has been up to lately.

30:35.578 --> 30:41.858
Say, if I make it right with Genny.
Commits I error to our son?

30:41.938 --> 30:46.498
Imma I've had a dream.

30:46.578 --> 30:51.978
-A dream?
-I dreamed that I could fly.

30:53.818 --> 30:59.738
You were also,
and below us there were lots of animals.

30:59.818 --> 31:05.458
There were lions ...
And Genny was there too!

31:05.538 --> 31:09.778
He had his bicycle.

31:09.858 --> 31:15.378
-Genny is a good boy.
-Yes, he is.

31:24.578 --> 31:27.498
Imma.

31:33.178 --> 31:36.818
Do not be afraid.

31:37.658 --> 31:41.698
No, do not worry.

31:41.778 --> 31:44.658
I'm not afraid.

31:44.738 --> 31:48.458
I'm not afraid.

32:01.698 --> 32:05.138
Let me out of here!

33:23.058 --> 33:27.138
Help! Please help me!

33:27.218 --> 33:29.978
Help!

33:32.978 --> 33:35.738
Help!

34:18.618 --> 34:21.378
-Here.
-Count thoroughly.

34:25.618 --> 34:29.297
Maria! Maria!

34:29.378 --> 34:33.378
-Maria!
-Maria!

34:36.138 --> 34:38.938
Maria!

35:22.418 --> 35:26.258
Run, run!

35:37.938 --> 35:41.938
-Run!
-Come on!

35:42.018 --> 35:46.178
-Move it!
-Save that one!

35:46.258 --> 35:51.298
-Put it on top!
-Come on!

36:14.298 --> 36:17.298
Close, Rosario!

36:34.498 --> 36:40.978
<i> authorities tighten grip </ i>
On Naples, especially with regard to drugs.</i>

36:41.058 --> 36:46.258
<i> There are probably related </ i>
for the murder of Marta Giacobone--</i>

36:46.338 --> 36:50.898
<i> -who was gunned down </ i>
middle of the day in a butcher shop.</i>

36:50.978 --> 36:54.738
<i> girl may be a victim </ i>
an act of revenge ...</i>

36:55.378 --> 36:58.978
We'll fix a meeting first. No war.

36:59.058 --> 37:05.018
If they want to kill us all,
be the first to hear my proposal.

37:05.098 --> 37:10.938
-Safe? It is a sign of weakness.
-I said:

37:11.018 --> 37:17.178
A meeting when they can and where they want.
It may well be with them.

37:18.458 --> 37:24.218
Don Pietro Savastano would not
have accepted such a thing.

37:26.498 --> 37:31.778
And where is Gennaro?
Is he alive? Where the hell is he?

37:32.298 --> 37:38.978
Why do you care about that?
What's with him?

37:39.058 --> 37:44.858
Do you think it will go better,
when Gennaro come back?

37:44.938 --> 37:50.218
You need to be where I am saying.
And you must tie styles.

37:54.818 --> 37:58.258
Go on.

37:58.338 --> 38:01.418
Get out!

38:01.498 --> 38:03.938
Goodbye.

38:32.658 --> 38:38.738
I do not want war.
No blood, no police after me.

38:38.818 --> 38:44.258
But everyone should appreciate
on Gennys work in Honduras.

38:44.338 --> 38:48.698
We can offer
excellent quality at spot prices

38:48.778 --> 38:53.258
-And consignments
come regularly and safely.

38:53.338 --> 38:57.098
All this
thanks to my son, Genny.

38:57.178 --> 39:03.738
If you want, we can sell to you
at an attractive price.

39:04.818 --> 39:08.538
But we've done the rough work.

39:08.618 --> 39:14.138
And therefore we are the ones
I make the rules. Period.

39:15.658 --> 39:21.618
If you want, you can declare war on us.

39:31.738 --> 39:35.858
I know what you're thinking.

39:37.218 --> 39:43.658
I divide people into those who do not
kill and those who kill.

39:43.738 --> 39:49.778
And because I'm a woman, do you think
I belong to the first group.

39:50.738 --> 39:54.578
But that was in error.

41:35.698 --> 41:40.058
I ought to kill you too.
