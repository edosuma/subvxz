WEBVTT

00:05.606 --> 00:07.675
He saw me
and reached for his gun.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.179
I shot him.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.483
I had to...

00:16.884 --> 00:19.887
to protect the public
and to protect myself.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.156
Did you almost die?

00:22.223 --> 00:24.425
No, Joe, no,
it's not like that.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.260
Um, I'm fine.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.296
- Did you have to kill him?
- Of course he did.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.464
That's what we're
trained to do,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.600
to make sure
nobody else gets hurt.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.003
But couldn't you
have shot him

00:36.070 --> 00:37.671
in the arm or something?

00:37.738 --> 00:39.073
Like on TV?

00:41.075 --> 00:42.576
That's not how it is
in real life.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.813
Uh, if I tried
to shoot him in the arm,

00:45.879 --> 00:49.517
I might have missed and hit
an innocent bystander.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.219
Are you going
to get a medal?

00:51.285 --> 00:53.121
- Don't be stupid.
- Jack.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.022
Dad could get fired
over this.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.225
Listen to the news.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.860
Daddy, are you going
to lose your job?

00:59.927 --> 01:01.895
Is that what you're
worried about?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.397
No, I'm not.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.866
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.136
So why aren't you at work?

01:08.202 --> 01:11.139
I get a few days off when
they look into everything.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.542
See, when something
like this happens,

01:14.608 --> 01:17.911
the department comes in
and makes sure the cops
did everything right.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.046
And I did.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.881
I'd give you a medal.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.184
I think you're a hero.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.187
Thank you, buddy.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.988
But you know what?
I'm not a hero.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.723
I was just doing my job.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.692
Okay?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.361
What was his name?

01:34.362 --> 01:36.697
Woodrow. Woody Woodrow.

01:38.832 --> 01:39.767
Was he black?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.872
He was white.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.841
Okay, boys, time for school.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.477
Go brush your teeth.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.044
Wait, um...

01:51.111 --> 01:53.314
I need a hug.
Come here.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.750
Oh, I love you, guys.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.152
I love you, Daddy.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.355
Here, take this.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.826
Thank you, Jackie.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.267
Ooh.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.804
That was tougher
than talking to IA.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.444
What?
You're mad at me?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.113
I'm happy you're okay.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.615
You are mad at me.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.486
I don't want those boys
to grow up without a father.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.924
They won't.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.241
**

03:11.992 --> 03:14.728
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:14.795 --> 03:16.964
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:17.030 --> 03:20.000
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:20.067 --> 03:22.403
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:22.470 --> 03:25.473
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:25.539 --> 03:27.708
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:27.775 --> 03:31.078
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:31.144 --> 03:32.380
* I can't let go *

03:44.958 --> 03:46.927
* I feel *

03:53.401 --> 03:57.271
Police! We have a warrant
to search the premises!

03:59.139 --> 04:00.741
Let 'er rip.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.262
Is it clear?

04:23.364 --> 04:24.632
All right.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.634
We're looking
for two weapons:

04:26.700 --> 04:29.803
a 9-millimeter used
to kill William Meadows

04:29.870 --> 04:32.105
and a knife with a 3-inch
curved blade

04:32.172 --> 04:33.541
used to kill Thomas Niese.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.743
Also anything and everything

04:35.809 --> 04:39.447
that would point to the
whereabouts of Xavi Moreno.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.118
Nah, I don't get it.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.087
Dobbs was a private
contractor.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.157
Guess that's how he was able
to afford a place like this.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.760
Yeah. That is possible.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.377
Did you find something?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.413
Cornell Jackson
ripped these guys off.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.880
Oh, is that
why they killed him?

05:46.947 --> 05:49.750
Maybe. Or he was just another
loose end like Sharkey.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.885
- You?
- Uh, nothing.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.655
As in nothing. The place
has been cleared out.

05:54.722 --> 05:55.723
It's practically empty.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.257
- Wiped clean?
- No, no.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.359
There's plenty of prints,
though so far it looks

05:59.427 --> 06:00.928
like they're all
from the same person.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.129
- Dobbs.
- Well,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.231
we still have to confirm
it, but who else?

06:04.297 --> 06:07.234
The family pictures?
The kids' toys?

06:07.300 --> 06:09.369
Your guess
is as good as mine.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.380
No gun.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.915
More knives
than a carnival act,

06:21.982 --> 06:24.151
but none that fit
the description.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.486
Unlike the Beemer.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.392
You are one ace detective.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.561
I know.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.095
Call it in, Kemosabe.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.465
This is 6-W-45.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.166
I need a tow
at this location.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.087
Can we please go home?

07:00.153 --> 07:01.188
Please?

07:03.090 --> 07:05.125
Look, between travel team
and school,

07:05.192 --> 07:06.494
you'll hardly be here.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.696
This sucks.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.731
It's just a few days.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.133
I can't do my job
if I'm worried about you.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.502
So you are worried?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.870
But I won't be if you're
here with Grace.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.172
I just want you
out of harm's way.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.875
Harm's way. What are we
talking about here, Dad?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.512
Is this like the kidnapping?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.446
Remember what I
promised you in Vegas

07:26.514 --> 07:27.915
that time at the airport?

07:27.981 --> 07:30.383
That I'd never be in that
kind of danger again.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.620
Right. I promised.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.321
But now it seems that I am.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.389
Which is why
I want you here.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.526
I want to help.
I want to learn, Dad.

07:38.592 --> 07:39.860
This is like
a teachable moment.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.762
I mean,
who are these guys?

07:44.031 --> 07:47.568
Okay, look,
when this is all over,

07:47.635 --> 07:50.003
we'll sit down,
we'll go through the case.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.204
Okay?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.142
I still think
I should be with you.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.247
We need to spend more
time at the range.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.050
I want to get really proficient
at that 9 millimeter.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.653
Deal.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.921
Come on. Grace is waiting.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.065
Hi, Maddie. Welcome.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.100
Hi.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.603
Lisa's in the guestroom,
getting it ready.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.508
I love you.

08:28.576 --> 08:29.843
Keep me posted.

08:29.910 --> 08:30.911
I promise.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.149
Hi.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.518
Go ahead.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.723
Thanks, Grace.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.057
Not to worry.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.964
Buen dÃ­a.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.178
Hey, handsome.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.479
Hey.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.281
You read about Caffrey?

09:41.348 --> 09:42.382
Yeah.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.483
Horrible way to go.

09:43.550 --> 09:44.818
The worst.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.319
Didn't he handle
your mother's case?

09:46.386 --> 09:47.821
He did.
Ever work with him?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.189
He was pulling the pin

09:49.256 --> 09:50.891
just about the time
I got to Hollywood.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.427
So it's not true you humped
a Shamu with Wyatt Earp?

09:54.494 --> 09:56.630
Yeah, yeah. That's true.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.198
Earp was my T.O.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.268
Damn shame about Caffrey.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.269
Yeah.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.761
Hello.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.262
Cindy Wagner, please.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.563
Detective Bosch, LAPD.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.832
Yeah, this is she.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.466
Thank you
for returning my call.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.036
I'd like to ask you
some questions about
your ex-husband.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.171
- Which one?
- Trevor Dobbs.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.708
Oh, Lord.
Where'd you dig him up?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.375
Is now a good time?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.884
So...

10:50.951 --> 10:53.253
Judge Houghton
wants you and Fowkkes

10:53.320 --> 10:55.522
to meet in her office
and talk.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.824
About?

10:56.890 --> 10:58.792
She wants a plea agreement.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.360
I want a trial.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.263
Make a deal, Anita.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.433
Do it now,
and it'll play in the media

11:06.499 --> 11:08.301
like Holland's capitulating.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.703
Or like our case is tanking.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.872
Our case is tanking.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.875
Make a deal.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.013
Fuck.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.314
Yesterday there was

11:21.381 --> 11:23.817
yet another
officer-involved shooting.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.019
This time,
the victim was a veteran

11:26.086 --> 11:28.221
of our illegal war in Iraq.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.359
LAPD is just another bunch
of bloodthirsty thugs,

11:32.425 --> 11:35.863
a street gang in blue
hiding behind the badge.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.765
Mr. Wolfe,
please stay on topic.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.233
My point is
I vigorously object

11:40.300 --> 11:42.736
to allocating 5,000
of my tax dollars

11:42.803 --> 11:44.471
to the K-9 unit

11:44.537 --> 11:45.873
for the oppression
and suppression

11:45.939 --> 11:47.340
of my fellow citizens.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.676
Yeah! That's right.

11:49.743 --> 11:53.814
report of the Chief of Police.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.715
Acting Chief Irving.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.920
I'd like
to reassure the public

11:59.987 --> 12:03.090
that our efforts to apprehend
the Koreatown Killer

12:03.156 --> 12:05.325
continue unabated
and will do so

12:05.392 --> 12:07.460
as long as it takes
to apprehend this criminal.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.563
Thank you, Chief.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.899
Speakers who would like

12:11.965 --> 12:15.435
to address the Chief's
comments on KTK?

12:15.502 --> 12:18.171
The next speakers
are Clifton Campbell,

12:18.238 --> 12:22.843
Big Mike, Super Batchick,
and Mr. Wolfe.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.679
Mr. Campbell, please
confine your comments

12:26.746 --> 12:28.816
to the Chief's remarks
and the topic at hand.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.483
Yes, your Honor.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.619
KTK.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.922
Let's face facts.

12:34.988 --> 12:38.025
It's going on what,
four years now?

12:39.659 --> 12:41.294
I live
in that neighborhood.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.096
People are scared.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.166
And I blame you,
Chief Irving.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.567
People are getting killed

12:47.634 --> 12:50.337
because of your
lack of leadership.

12:50.403 --> 12:54.975
It's clear by now
LAPD can't handle KTK.

12:55.042 --> 12:58.111
He's outsmarted you
at every turn.

12:59.046 --> 13:02.515
We Angelenos deserve better.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.451
I'm afraid
the Koreatown Killer

13:04.517 --> 13:07.888
will continue his reign
of terror indefinitely

13:07.955 --> 13:09.722
until we get a new chief.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.863
Thank you.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.169
Thank you, Mr. Campbell.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.337
And thank you for your tone.

13:24.404 --> 13:27.074
We could use more of that
civility in these sessions.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.043
The next speaker
is Big Mike.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.479
Regarding
the Koreatown Killer,

13:32.545 --> 13:34.948
Chief Irving,
you're nothing but a Tom,

13:35.015 --> 13:37.784
cooning for The Man
in that blue uniform.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.052
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.254
Yeah!

13:50.030 --> 13:51.999
Judge Houghton?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.167
She's waiting
to hear from us.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.481
Voluntary manslaughter.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.384
Sentencing rec?

14:11.451 --> 14:12.519
The max.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.056
11.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.290
He behaves himself,

14:17.357 --> 14:18.892
- he's out in six.
- Oh, please.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.360
Then let's go to trial
on the murder charges.

14:20.427 --> 14:24.264
Anita, We're having
this conversation

14:24.331 --> 14:27.867
because you can't prove
he killed her at all,

14:27.935 --> 14:30.270
unintentionally
or otherwise.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.305
This case should never
have been brought.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.607
DNA from a consensual
sexual encounter,

14:34.674 --> 14:36.043
no witnesses,

14:36.109 --> 14:39.012
a timeline you could
drive a Corvette through,

14:39.079 --> 14:41.915
no history
of aberrant behavior
on Mr. Holland's part.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.550
Thanks to your
witness tampering.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.751
Oh, and your star witness?

14:44.817 --> 14:45.919
Thoroughly discredited

14:45.986 --> 14:48.755
as a suspect
in another homicide.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.461
You're not even
planning to call Bosch

14:56.363 --> 14:57.564
Mm-hmm.

14:57.630 --> 14:58.966
I guessed it right.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.068
- What are you looking for?
- Time served.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.103
Oh, please.
You're joking, right.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.271
He's been
under house arrest.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.905
Confined for more
than a year

15:05.973 --> 15:08.508
on trumped up,
spurious charges.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.646
Involuntary man.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.116
Sentencing rec?

15:16.183 --> 15:18.518
four years.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.919
Ah. Geez.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.022
Four years is a lifetime
in his business.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.091
With good behavior,
out in two.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.793
Credited with 14 months
of time served?

15:26.859 --> 15:29.129
Fuck you.
I draw the line.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.733
I'll talk it over
with my client,

15:33.800 --> 15:35.969
and I will get
back to you anon.

15:45.478 --> 15:49.782
Hey, Harry.
How's our boy doing?

15:49.849 --> 15:50.950
He's holding up.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.785
Good.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.322
Listen,
some of us old timers

15:55.388 --> 15:57.390
were thinking about
throwing a little

15:57.457 --> 15:59.993
"end of watch debrief"
for young Edgar.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.795
A K-party? Thought
we don't do that anymore.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.731
We don't.
So, how about it?

16:04.797 --> 16:08.768
It's kind of poking
the department bear,
don't you think?

16:08.835 --> 16:10.803
I'm not inviting
the damn department.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.573
Look, Mank, I'm a little under
the microscope right now.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.075
Come on.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.244
Couple of piss-ant
IA investigations,

16:17.310 --> 16:19.779
you're turning
all soft and PC on me?

16:19.846 --> 16:22.315
Thought you were
a proud member of the
"sixth month" club.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.784
Jesus, Mank, not by choice.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.587
All right, Roger that.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.257
I'll call Jerry myself,
keep you out of it.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.191
Thanks.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.360
But you better
fucking be there.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.927
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.130
Get out.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.432
Latents pulled some
prints from the Beemer,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.634
and there might be
trace blood evidence.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.735
Well, fingers crossed.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.737
What about
Moreno's boat?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.039
Coast Guard, sheriff,

16:46.106 --> 16:47.674
Harbor Masters
on the lookout.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.643
We're in touch with
his insurance company
to get the GPS.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.978
He'll disable it.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.813
What's he gonna do,
navigate by the stars?

16:53.880 --> 16:55.382
He knows how.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.317
You mind if we
check it out anyway?

16:57.384 --> 16:58.985
Not at all.
Your goose chase.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.787
Did you reach the ex-wife?

17:00.853 --> 17:03.956
She split right after
he deployed for Iraq,
his first tour.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.958
- She say why?
- He made her nervous.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.560
She'd wake up
in the middle of the night,

17:07.627 --> 17:10.029
and he'd be staring at her,
and not in a good way.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.931
I can see why that
might make her nervous.

17:11.998 --> 17:16.136
So, after he shipped out,
she moved, got a divorce.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.237
Hasn't seen him since.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.638
What about the kids?

17:18.705 --> 17:19.739
There are no kids.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.541
So the toys?
The family photos?

17:21.608 --> 17:23.143
Phony.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.178
Somebody else's kids.
Somebody else's wife.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.880
The woman in the photos
is not Cindy Wagner.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.015
Foo.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.784
So deeply,
deeply fucking weird.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.486
Deeply dangerous.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.289
Don't let him sell you

17:36.356 --> 17:37.890
the fucking Viking Flybridge.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.059
That piece of shit is a tub.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.296
I have no fucking idea
what you're talking about.

17:43.363 --> 17:47.267
Guy said he's got some sweet
Bertrams, Sea Rays, Carvers.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.768
So long as it floats.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.140
Gunned him down
like a goddamn dog.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.076
He drew on that cop.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.013
Should've
just gone peaceably.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.382
They had nothing on him.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.184
If he drew on him,
why didn't he waste him?

18:04.251 --> 18:05.685
That's what I don't get.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.124
Caught him unawares.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.260
A fucking detective?

18:13.326 --> 18:16.129
Probably never fired his
weapon in his whole life.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.332
He was on the fucking
phone with me.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.836
Oh.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.607
Yeah.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.477
I wonder if the cops
got his money.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.179
Most likely.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.749
Got to let it go.
Time to move on.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.219
We got ours.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.455
Yes, we did.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.692
What's your plan?

18:46.993 --> 18:48.295
Somewhere warm.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.164
Cabo.
Then Costa Rica.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.367
- You?
- Headed north. Vancouver.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.569
Maybe
the Queen Charlottes.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.005
Too frÃ­o para mi, bro.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.807
And too fucking white.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.417
It's been an honor
being your captain.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.018
Sir.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.920
The honor's been all mine.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.231
Hey, Pierce.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.765
Hey. How's Edgar?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.534
He's fine. I'll tell him
you said hey.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.702
- You need something?
- DNA results.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.038
- Jesse Tafero's watch?
- End of the day, maybe.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.740
I thought you put
a rush on that.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.942
What're you gonna do?
Every time I call over there,

19:36.008 --> 19:37.344
they say
you can't rush science.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.746
But you can rush lab tachs.
Keep pressing.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.348
- Bosch.
- Jimmy.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.015
- Everything good here?
- Couldn't be better.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.084
Pierce, you're gonna let me
know about the watch, right?

19:45.151 --> 19:46.319
Sure thing.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.526
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.228
I was going
to leave a message.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.863
Now you don't have to.
How are you?

19:56.929 --> 19:57.997
I've been better.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.032
I just heard back
from Fowkkes.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.668
Holland won't take a plea.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.738
Good. I'm glad
he turned it down.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.341
Such a chickenshit, O'Shea.
Take it to trial.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.277
Yeah, it's easy
for you to say.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.711
I'm the one who has
to go in there

20:11.778 --> 20:13.212
without my two most
important witnesses.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.848
You know what
the counter was?

20:15.915 --> 20:17.250
Let me guess. Time served.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.752
Not even.
Dismiss the charges,

20:19.819 --> 20:22.822
no admission of guilt,
and an apology from the city,

20:22.889 --> 20:24.123
and he promises not to sue.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.792
Well, I hope
you laughed in his face.

20:25.858 --> 20:29.128
I would've, but I'm afraid
O'Shea might make me take it.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.330
Where are you with Gunn?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.164
Getting closer.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.400
I hope so.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.468
I'm getting skewered
if Holland walks.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.804
That's what you're most
worried about, your career?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.706
Well, shouldn't I be?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.741
Just because yours
is always in the toilet

20:41.808 --> 20:43.410
and you don't seem to care
about it doesn't mean--

20:43.476 --> 20:44.944
Yeah. Good. Bye.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.918
You ever get
through to your mom?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.420
I gave up on that for now.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.221
It's impossible
with the time difference.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.923
And her schedule is cray-cray.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.558
She really play poker
for a living?

20:58.625 --> 21:01.661
Yeah. She was an FBI
agent before that.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.663
- That's so cool.
- Which?

21:03.730 --> 21:05.832
Poker. She ever teach you?

21:05.898 --> 21:09.336
She tried, but I have
zero interest in cards.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.770
Why not?

21:10.837 --> 21:12.004
I want to be a cop.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.375
Not me. I mean,
look what just happened.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.076
J. Edgar
could've been killed.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.244
And your dad, too,

21:18.311 --> 21:20.413
I mean, if he'd been there.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.715
Although he is
a total badass.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.016
Harry?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.918
Totally.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.955
I know he seems like he is.

21:29.021 --> 21:33.059
And he is, but he isn't.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.328
No, I know.
Like my parents.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.029
Your mom is so tough.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.432
I never
say goodbye to her.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.300
I always say
"See you later."

21:41.368 --> 21:43.670
"Love you, Mom.
See you later."

21:43.736 --> 21:46.473
Feels better than goodbye.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.877
And we find the death

21:50.943 --> 21:52.845
of John Bradfield
and Goldie West

21:52.912 --> 21:55.515
due to accidental causes
while evading arrest

21:55.582 --> 21:57.717
for the murder
of Charles McGee.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.752
Well, the papers
can't squawk this time.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.288
A guy is murdered,
and six hours later,

22:02.355 --> 22:04.691
we not only discover
who committed the crime,

22:04.757 --> 22:06.192
but we also know
that he's dead.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.060
Can you imagine the howl

22:08.127 --> 22:10.162
if this hadn't happened?
Killing a reporter--

22:19.271 --> 22:21.140
- Hey, brother.
- Hey.

22:21.207 --> 22:24.010
Thought you could use
some company and some grub.

22:25.478 --> 22:28.314
Oh. Great flick.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.416
Yeah.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.750
Where's your security detail?

22:30.817 --> 22:32.685
I turned it down.
Where's yours?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.454
Having beers with your guys.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.790
Maddie?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.826
Staying with Grace
until this blows over.

22:39.892 --> 22:40.927
That's smart.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.462
Just a precaution.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.096
Eleanor
knows what's going on?

22:44.163 --> 22:46.132
I asked Maddie
not to tell her.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.500
You know, why worry her?

22:47.567 --> 22:48.635
What can she do about it?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.236
Fly in from Hong Kong.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.105
The last thing I need.
Have to worry about her, too.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.408
Gonna grab a beer.
You want one?

22:55.475 --> 22:56.976
I'm good.

22:58.411 --> 23:00.379
What's the latest on Gunn?

23:00.447 --> 23:02.849
Just got off the phone
with Pierce.

23:02.915 --> 23:07.286
DNA from Jesse Tafero's watch
finally came back.

23:07.353 --> 23:11.057
I'm guessing from your
tone of voice...

23:11.123 --> 23:12.559
we struck out.

23:12.625 --> 23:16.262
Jesse Tafero's watch,
Jesse Tafero's DNA.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.930
Nothing from Gunn.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.766
- Shit.
- Yeah.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.307
So how's your family
sorting through this?

23:28.374 --> 23:30.109
Ah...

23:30.176 --> 23:32.211
boys are confused.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.681
Full of questions.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.116
Tonya's acting all mad at me.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.418
Shit, I'm mad too, you know?

23:39.486 --> 23:42.489
Mad at this asshole for
putting me in this situation,

23:42.555 --> 23:44.824
fucking making me kill him...

23:45.825 --> 23:47.727
and having to explain it
to my kids.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.063
Ain't it the truth.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.571
I got everything
you wanted, baby.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.507
Good girl.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.113
Did you tighten
that hose clamp?

24:07.179 --> 24:10.216
Um, you can tighten mine.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.820
Bad boy. Love to.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.326
Did you figure out
where we're going?

24:20.392 --> 24:21.961
That place we found?

24:22.028 --> 24:23.395
Sea of Cortez?

24:23.462 --> 24:26.799
Umm. How could I forget?

24:28.701 --> 24:30.036
I'm gonna meet you there.

24:30.102 --> 24:33.039
Papi, no.
You're coming with me.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.206
You can do it.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.742
I gotta
take care of something.

24:37.276 --> 24:40.813
- I want to stay with you.
- Ai, mami.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.549
Do what I tell you
for once.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.251
If I take the boat,

24:45.317 --> 24:46.452
how are you
gonna get there?

24:46.519 --> 24:48.220
Walk if I have to.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.089
You're gonna walk to Baja?

24:50.156 --> 24:51.157
That's crazy.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.458
I walked across Afghanistan.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.093
I can walk to fucking Baja

24:54.160 --> 24:56.195
in my sleep.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.652
Harry.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.254
Thanks for meeting me,
Mark.

25:22.321 --> 25:23.723
Sure.

25:25.491 --> 25:26.926
You got another one
of those?

25:47.413 --> 25:48.514
What is it?

25:48.581 --> 25:51.217
A thumb drive.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.819
What's on it?

25:52.885 --> 25:53.820
Footage.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.455
- From?
- The rooftop camera.

25:56.522 --> 26:00.059
Oh, Jesus, Harry.
Of what?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.662
Won't mean anything to you.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.931
What do you want me
to do with it?

26:04.997 --> 26:07.433
Just make sure it can't be
traced to either of us.

26:07.499 --> 26:08.968
No shit.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.240
This has to be it,
Harry.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.778
Just do this,
and everything's jake.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.289
Always with the pickles.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.258
You don't even like pickles.
Why do you get them?

26:32.324 --> 26:34.861
You like pickles.
I get them for you.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.663
Mm. You're sweet.

26:41.467 --> 26:43.102
Conniff.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.604
Detective. Officer
John Enochty, Rampart.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.039
We have your suspect
in custody.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.042
- Come again?
- KTK, man.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.645
Pulled him over running
a red light on a stolen bike.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.413
You working
off the composite?

26:54.480 --> 26:56.348
Spitting image.
You'll see.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.050
Famous last words.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.053
This is him, man.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.823
I mean, he's even
got an arrest in '06:

27:03.890 --> 27:05.624
attempted car-jacking.
I mean, come on.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.293
All right, just book him
for RSP with a prior.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.095
- We'll swing by
in the morning.
- Are you sure?

27:09.161 --> 27:11.764
Because we can book him
on the other right now,
no problem.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.532
Don't say anything
to anyone about KTK.

27:13.599 --> 27:14.967
Just get a good shake.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.206
Officer McGruff here, he wants
to arrest the guy already.

27:20.272 --> 27:21.273
Dickhead.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.309
Fucking RHD.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.712
You know they're going to
take their sweet-assed time

27:25.778 --> 27:27.346
- getting down here.
- Fuck that.

27:34.620 --> 27:35.988
On your feet.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.899
Oh, hey, guess what.

27:46.966 --> 27:50.069
Fingerprints paid off.
Sharkey was in the Beemer.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.337
DNA?

27:51.403 --> 27:53.605
Moreno's, not Sharkey's.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.407
Still might be enough.

27:55.474 --> 27:56.809
Dobbs using his credit cards?

27:56.876 --> 27:58.210
Not since the day
I interviewed him.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.312
Hasn't touched
his cell phone, either.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.613
What's he spend his money on?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.949
Takeout, guns, web cam porn.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.917
Barrel's new bachelor routine.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.953
Sounds like he's
livin' the dream.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.554
Keep you posted
on Moreno.

28:08.620 --> 28:09.856
Thanks, brother.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.345
Did you authenticate
the tape?

30:13.412 --> 30:15.514
Techs at the paper
said it's kosher.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.850
Note the date and time stamp.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.152
The night
Gunn was murdered.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.154
It was messengered
to the Times,

30:22.221 --> 30:23.956
so whoever sent it
used a phony name.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.158
Times sent it to me unopened.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.827
Can they
trace the thumb drive

30:28.895 --> 30:30.229
back to a computer?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.331
All identifiers
have been removed.

30:32.398 --> 30:33.799
Of course they have.

30:33.866 --> 30:34.901
You can keep that.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.969
I have it in the cloud.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.739
You writing
an article about this?

30:40.806 --> 30:42.574
Not until I can
verify the source.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.543
You recognize the two guys?

30:44.610 --> 30:47.313
I can't comment on
an ongoing investigation.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.680
Is that a yes?

30:48.747 --> 30:50.249
That's a no comment.

30:51.650 --> 30:52.618
Off the record.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.320
Not this time.

30:57.089 --> 30:59.625
I want the story first
when you crack it.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.161
Yeah, I'll do what I can.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.896
I'll tell you one thing.

31:03.963 --> 31:04.997
What's that?

31:05.064 --> 31:06.933
The guy's a smoker.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.433
Motherfucker.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.471
We know where that tape
was recorded.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.242
That's
where the camera was.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.412
Pointed right at Gunn's
front door.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.916
Ain't that a bitch?

32:30.983 --> 32:32.484
Well,
he disabled the GPS.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.153
The tracking system
couldn't find him.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.454
As I said before.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.990
Ah, but a harbor master
down in Baja

32:38.057 --> 32:39.525
saw a boat pull in

32:39.591 --> 32:40.826
that matched the Bolo.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.528
He contacted
the authorities.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.196
They checked the HIN.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.432
It's the Aye Papi
under a different name.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.134
They have it
under surveillance.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.435
- Whereabouts?
- La Paz.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.537
- Gulf of California.
- Sea of Cortez.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.106
You'll need to bring
the Foreign Prosecution
Unit on this.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.042
And someone's gotta
go down there with them.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.777
Ooh. A little
Mexican vacation.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.212
You want in on this, Harry?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.847
Check my weapon
at the border,

33:01.913 --> 33:03.382
sit in the back
of a dark truck,

33:03.449 --> 33:05.784
sweating my ass off while
the Federales bust my guy?

33:05.851 --> 33:07.053
Not my style.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.255
Well, yeah, when you
put it like that.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.257
I'm on Dobbs.
I'll talk to Moreno

33:11.323 --> 33:12.491
when you've got him
back here in custody.

33:12.558 --> 33:15.027
Copy that.
Bring him back alive.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.762
Be careful.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.432
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.535
Heard you guys scored some
grade A surveillance footage.

33:23.602 --> 33:24.936
Floated in on the tide.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.739
Puts Jesse Tafero at the scene
the night of the murder.

33:27.806 --> 33:28.974
Of course
it's not admissible.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.509
You can still use it.

33:30.576 --> 33:31.710
Oh, we will.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.745
And I'm sure whoever
sent it to Scott Anderson

33:33.812 --> 33:35.047
is planning on just that.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.249
That would be
the right play.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.451
How do you see
this thing going?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.019
You squeeze Jesse
to get to Rudy.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.254
Rudy
gives you Holland.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.922
Because Holland's
your end game.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.857
Because he's behind it.

33:45.924 --> 33:47.326
Okay.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.161
First thing tomorrow.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.529
Jimmy, you're cutting me in?

33:50.596 --> 33:52.298
I want to see how you're
going to do this.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.134
Nobody
rattles Rudy Tafero's
cage like you do.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.336
I like to think of it
as a gift.

34:02.674 --> 34:03.675
Hello.

34:03.742 --> 34:04.743
Mark Taylor, please.

34:04.810 --> 34:05.777
Who's calling?

34:05.844 --> 34:06.845
Jerry Edgar.

34:06.912 --> 34:08.514
I'm a detective with LAPD.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.150
Fucking guy.

34:14.486 --> 34:15.721
Leave a message.

34:16.955 --> 34:18.957
Mr. Taylor, Jerry Edgar.

34:19.024 --> 34:21.227
We got disconnected.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.195
I wanted to ask you
a few questions

34:23.262 --> 34:24.996
about my partner
Harry Bosch.

34:27.999 --> 34:30.402
You have my number.
Give me a call.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.680
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.649
I was in the neighborhood.

34:43.715 --> 34:46.818
Thought I'd stop by,
see how you're doing.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.354
On your way to Studio City?

34:48.420 --> 34:50.222
I'm calling your bullshit
on that, Jimmy.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.890
Yeah,
a little out of my way.

34:51.957 --> 34:53.425
Mm-hmm.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.493
Come on in.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.094
Just stop blowing
smoke up my ass.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.729
All right. Fair enough.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.735
You heard about the tape?

35:03.802 --> 35:04.903
I heard.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.238
From a rooftop
surveillance camera

35:06.305 --> 35:07.673
across the way from Gunn's.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.341
Shows two guys
breaking into his place

35:09.408 --> 35:11.943
- the night he was murdered.
- The killers.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.279
You found the camera?

35:13.345 --> 35:15.814
I sure as shit
found where it was.

35:17.183 --> 35:20.085
You know damn well
that tape came from Bosch.

35:20.152 --> 35:22.087
I don't know that.

35:22.154 --> 35:24.223
Look, Harry
didn't kill Gunn.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.392
You've seen the tape,
right? Is he on it?

35:26.458 --> 35:27.359
No.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.395
Jesse Tafero
and another guy.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.996
- Rudy.
- Probably.

35:31.062 --> 35:32.231
Doesn't that
exonerate Bosch?

35:32.298 --> 35:34.433
Come on. He's involved.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.001
He's complicit
somehow, some way,

35:36.067 --> 35:37.536
and you know it.
Makes you complicit too.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.905
I got nothing more
to tell you, Jimmy.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.611
Shit hits the fan
on this,

35:45.677 --> 35:47.613
don't say I didn't
give you a chance.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.048
You look beat.

35:50.115 --> 35:51.850
Get some rest.

36:01.427 --> 36:02.794
Sorry we missed dinner.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.364
I'm not.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.568
Hungry?

36:09.635 --> 36:10.769
Mm-mm.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.504
We could order room
service, go downstairs.

36:12.571 --> 36:13.505
Um,

36:13.572 --> 36:16.375
I'm happy right where I am.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.574
Do you have to get that?

36:56.147 --> 36:58.350
I do not.

37:07.092 --> 37:09.961
A man believed to be the
so-called Koreatown Killer,

37:10.028 --> 37:12.764
suspected in a four-year
string of violent crimes,

37:12.831 --> 37:13.899
has been arrested.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.467
The Los Angeles Police
Department says

37:15.534 --> 37:17.536
45-year-old Calvin Wilson
was pulled over

37:17.603 --> 37:19.271
for a routine traffic stop.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.773
Wilson has been linked to a
half dozen robbery-assaults,

37:21.840 --> 37:25.043
four car jackings, three
shootings, and two murders.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.545
Not even close.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.314
Wilson is being held
without bail--

37:34.353 --> 37:35.854
Shit.

37:38.490 --> 37:39.991
- They're here
On my way.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.427
Jesse Tafero.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.729
You're under arrest for
the murder of Edward Gunn.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.897
He can't talk
right now, Rudy.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.633
Bosch, what the fuck?

37:49.234 --> 37:50.736
Let's go.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.878
Where's my brother?
I know he's here.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.212
You just brought him in.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.481
Then you know that he's
being processed.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.650
This is fucking bullshit.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.051
Frequently.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.520
Don't even try to talk
to him without a lawyer.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.389
I didn't want to talk
to him in the first place.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.157
Then why'd you drag him
down here again?

38:12.223 --> 38:14.360
I know what it is
you're doing.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.628
I was you, only better.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.999
I'm telling you, Rudy,
I got no dog in this fight.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.202
This is not your doing?

38:24.269 --> 38:25.471
Bosch's idea.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.673
And this bad blood
between you and Bosch

38:27.739 --> 38:30.609
has got nothing to do
with me or my case.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.244
Then can we fucking
fix this now?

38:33.311 --> 38:35.080
We'll sort this out.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.491
I need you to babysit.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.867
- You want coffee?
- No.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.269
I need coffee.
I'll be right back.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.805
Cream, two sugars.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.079
Stay put.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.922
Cream, two sugars.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.089
Pussy.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.932
Where's Robertson?

39:26.998 --> 39:27.966
Taking a leak.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.401
He'll be back in a minute.

39:30.436 --> 39:31.970
Meantime...

39:34.339 --> 39:35.841
Meantime nothing.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.577
Talk to your brother yet?

39:38.644 --> 39:39.911
He's being processed.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.781
So okay.
So we got some time.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.166
Oh, shit.

40:03.469 --> 40:05.871
You've got the wrong
Mark Taylor.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.873
Don't call me again.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.119
Hello.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.188
Okay, listen,
ten years ago,

40:23.254 --> 40:26.357
I was hired to do matrimonial
work for Mrs. Smith.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.093
Lester Smith was
cheating on his wife.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.028
I was hired to take
the pictures to prove it.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.564
I had no connection with
what happened after that.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.232
- With his murder.
- That's right.

40:34.299 --> 40:35.601
That's how you know Bosch.

40:35.667 --> 40:36.735
My prints showed up

40:36.802 --> 40:39.471
at their house,
the crime scene.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.939
Bosch kept me out of it.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.974
That's it.
End of story.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.375
Not quite.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.812
In return, you did
some work for him.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.346
You're still
working for him.

40:48.413 --> 40:49.815
I'm not.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.150
Your thumbprint
on a camera

40:52.217 --> 40:54.452
I found inside
Edward Gunn's apartment.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.888
You set up the system,

40:56.955 --> 40:59.625
the outside camera,
the one on the roof
across the way.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.162
Not on the phone.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.497
Tell me where.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.599
MacArthur Park.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.234
Picnic tables,
near 7th Street.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.736
Thirty minutes.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.079
Aw, come on.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.048
Oh, hey.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.050
Fucking IA. Harry.

41:46.972 --> 41:48.607
Hollywood Watch Commander's
Office, inside line.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.308
- I'm shot.
- What?

41:50.375 --> 41:51.577
Officer down, Mank.

41:51.643 --> 41:53.144
It's Jerry Edgar. I'm shot.

41:54.379 --> 41:55.847
I need help. I'm under fire.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.283
Jerry, where are you?

41:58.349 --> 41:59.551
Home. Outside.

41:59.618 --> 42:00.552
Your house?

42:00.619 --> 42:02.754
Driveway. Oh, shit.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.956
All right.
You talk to me, Jerry.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.625
You tell me what you see.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.560
This is 6-L-90.

42:08.627 --> 42:09.828
Officer needs help.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.163
Officer down.
Baldwin Hills.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.531
I need ambulance and unit

42:13.599 --> 42:16.501
to 5751 Bow Cross Street.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.570
Jerry, where is the shooter?

42:18.637 --> 42:20.572
Is he still on the scene?

42:21.506 --> 42:23.609
Jerry.

42:23.675 --> 42:25.276
You talk to me, Jerry Edgar.

42:25.343 --> 42:26.912
Wh-Where are the shots

42:26.978 --> 42:28.914
coming from?
What do you see?

42:28.980 --> 42:31.650
- I'm not--
- Jerry.

42:31.717 --> 42:34.285
I'm not sure I saw him.

42:34.352 --> 42:37.923
Maybe...on the hill,
in the park.

42:37.989 --> 42:39.925
It...

42:39.991 --> 42:42.493
It sounds like a rifle.
Oh, shit.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.029
Ohh.

42:44.095 --> 42:45.196
Jerry?

42:47.532 --> 42:48.767
Jerry?

42:53.639 --> 42:55.641
- Jack.
- Jerry!

42:56.574 --> 42:57.743
Jack.
