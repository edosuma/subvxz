<b><i>I have to defeat him,</i></b>

00:06.730 --> 00:07.820
<b><i>or it's all over!</i></b>

00:10.190 --> 00:14.990
<b><i>I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!</i></b>

01:34.990 --> 01:39.990
<b>Friend x And x Journey</b>

01:42.880 --> 01:44.790
<b>Determined to protect Gon</b>

01:44.790 --> 01:49.430
<b>for the thirty days he can't use <i>Nen</i>,</b>

01:49.430 --> 01:52.020
<b>Killua prepares for a fight with a Chimera Ant.</b>

01:52.820 --> 01:53.820
<b>However...</b>

02:04.690 --> 02:05.730
<b><i>Run.</i></b>

02:26.810 --> 02:28.680
<b>Yes! That's more like it!</b>

02:28.680 --> 02:30.520
<b>That terrified expression...</b>

02:30.520 --> 02:32.360
<b>I love it!</b>

02:34.850 --> 02:39.050
<b>Damn, I'm getting excited now...</b>

02:42.940 --> 02:46.310
<b>I'm gonna tear you apart.</b>

02:47.180 --> 02:50.240
<b><i>If you aren't certain you can win, run.</i></b>

02:51.140 --> 02:53.690
<b><i>I have to protect him... I have to...</i></b>

02:54.660 --> 02:56.320
<b><i>When you know nothing of your opponent...</i></b>

02:57.150 --> 02:58.280
<b><i>...protect Gon.</i></b>

02:59.310 --> 03:00.550
<b><i>...run away.</i></b>

03:02.080 --> 03:03.780
<b><i>No matter what!</i></b>

03:45.600 --> 03:47.240
<b>Is there something special about that tree?</b>

03:48.370 --> 03:50.430
<b>Just wait a little longer.</b>

04:35.310 --> 04:37.200
<b>Amazing...</b>

04:38.000 --> 04:39.550
<b>They're seaside fireflies.</b>

04:40.250 --> 04:42.360
<b>They're only found around brackish water,</b>

04:42.360 --> 04:44.100
<b>and this is their breeding season.</b>

04:44.420 --> 04:45.880
<b>It's beautiful!</b>

04:45.880 --> 04:46.770
<b>Isn't it?</b>

05:07.220 --> 05:09.580
<b>You piss yourself or something?</b>

05:10.010 --> 05:11.070
<b>Well?!</b>

05:12.040 --> 05:14.330
<b>Can't even move a muscle?</b>

05:14.330 --> 05:15.980
<b>Lose your spine?</b>

05:25.350 --> 05:28.190
<b>Damn, this feels so good...</b>

05:28.190 --> 05:29.620
<b>Should I kill him?</b>

05:29.620 --> 05:32.710
<b>Ah, but I want to enjoy this!</b>

05:44.920 --> 05:45.570
<b>Here.</b>

05:48.260 --> 05:49.320
<b>It's a present.</b>

05:49.950 --> 05:52.330
<b>This is the most beautiful flower in the world.</b>

05:55.710 --> 05:56.830
<b>It is?</b>

05:58.440 --> 06:00.080
<b>Stay still.</b>

06:26.590 --> 06:30.450
<b>The tree's sap is very similar to 
the pheromones fireflies emit,</b>

06:30.450 --> 06:32.240
<b>so they tend to gather around branches.</b>

06:35.070 --> 06:36.550
<b>I'm so happy...</b>

06:40.060 --> 06:41.370
<b>Thank you.</b>

06:42.720 --> 06:43.810
<b>Really?</b>

06:44.340 --> 06:45.650
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

06:48.100 --> 06:50.300
<b>But I...</b>

06:50.890 --> 06:54.390
<b>I can't give you what you truly want.</b>

06:56.110 --> 06:57.800
<b>What I truly want?</b>

06:59.380 --> 07:01.020
<b>Time alone with me.</b>

07:01.410 --> 07:02.400
<b>Eh?</b>

07:07.140 --> 07:08.400
<b>I...</b>

07:09.200 --> 07:11.410
<b>I want to become stronger.</b>

07:12.030 --> 07:14.380
<b>Strong enough to defeat the Chimera Ants.</b>

07:15.560 --> 07:19.410
<b>That means I have to train harder.</b>

07:20.800 --> 07:23.230
<b>In two days, Kite's coming back.</b>

07:23.230 --> 07:25.590
<b>But it sounds like he's under enemy control.</b>

07:26.130 --> 07:30.220
<b>To return him to normal, I'll probably 
have to fight whoever is controlling him.</b>

07:35.050 --> 07:38.480
<b>So until Kite is back to normal...</b>

07:39.210 --> 07:42.400
<b>Or if possible, until the 
Chimera Ants are defeated...</b>

07:42.960 --> 07:44.890
<b>I want to focus on my training.</b>

07:51.670 --> 07:53.530
<b>Yes... Yes!</b>

07:56.070 --> 07:58.410
<b>Are you okay with that?</b>

08:04.250 --> 08:05.500
<b>Huh?</b>

08:05.500 --> 08:06.960
<b>What was that?</b>

08:09.600 --> 08:11.970
<b>Damn! I can't get enough!</b>

08:20.340 --> 08:21.270
<b><i>Run...</i></b>

08:22.180 --> 08:23.280
<b><i>Hurry.</i></b>

08:23.630 --> 08:24.830
<b><i>No...</i></b>

08:29.730 --> 08:31.110
<b><i>Gon!</i></b>

08:35.290 --> 08:36.370
<b><i>I will...</i></b>

08:43.200 --> 08:44.620
<b><i>...protect you.</i></b>

08:46.860 --> 08:48.090

08:58.410 --> 09:01.890
<b>You're my dear friend!</b>

09:03.860 --> 09:06.080
<b>Stop that...</b>

09:06.080 --> 09:08.230
<b>Don't look at me like that.</b>

09:11.400 --> 09:14.300
<b>I c-can't stop myself...</b>

09:14.300 --> 09:15.660
<b>I'll kill you.</b>

09:15.660 --> 09:18.280
<b>I'll kill you! I'll kill you...</b>

09:19.130 --> 09:20.030
<b><i>Run.</i></b>

09:21.140 --> 09:22.360
<b><i>Shut up!</i></b>

09:24.020 --> 09:25.290
<b><i>Run.</i></b>

09:26.150 --> 09:27.680
<b><i>I won't listen to you!</i></b>

09:28.960 --> 09:32.800
<b><i>Run... Run... Run...</i></b>

09:32.800 --> 09:34.530
<b><i>Shut up!</i></b>

09:37.330 --> 09:42.160
<b>I'll leave the head, but eat the rest!</b>

09:43.240 --> 09:44.430
<b><i>Run.</i></b>

09:45.940 --> 09:47.470
<b>I don't want</b>

09:48.670 --> 09:50.440
<b>to lose him!</b>

09:52.130 --> 09:53.360
<b><i>Run.</i></b>

09:54.650 --> 09:55.660
<b><i>Gon is...</i></b>

09:57.300 --> 09:58.450
<b><i>Run.</i></b>

09:59.970 --> 10:01.200
<b><i>...my...</i></b>

10:02.200 --> 10:03.450
<b><i>Run.</i></b>

10:04.330 --> 10:05.530
<b><i>...dear...</i></b>

10:07.250 --> 10:08.500
<b><i>Run.</i></b>

10:12.000 --> 10:13.790
<b><i>It has to be Killua.</i></b>

10:15.220 --> 10:19.010
<b>My very dear friend!</b>

10:29.540 --> 10:30.590
<b>He disappeared?</b>

10:47.420 --> 10:49.040
<b>He fooled me good.</b>

10:50.950 --> 10:54.760
<b>Illumi must have planted this</b>

10:58.660 --> 11:00.760
<b>inside my head.</b>

11:01.140 --> 11:03.710
<b>Huh? What are you talking about?</b>

11:04.160 --> 11:05.470
<b>Have you lost your mind?</b>

11:06.010 --> 11:08.770
<b>And how did you dodge that?</b>

11:10.870 --> 11:13.270
<b><i>Wait, I saw the whole thing.</i></b>

11:14.700 --> 11:17.850
<b><i>Right before I reached him,</i></b>

11:18.320 --> 11:20.700
<b><i>he jammed his finger into his own head.</i></b>

11:21.460 --> 11:23.620
<b><i>And then he vanished,</i></b>

11:24.320 --> 11:25.830
<b><i>before popping up over there.</i></b>

11:25.830 --> 11:29.440
<b>Yeah, I feel so much better now.</b>

11:30.210 --> 11:32.240
<b>I'm completely awake now.</b>

11:32.240 --> 11:35.040
<b>Or maybe I should say I'm liberated.</b>

11:35.660 --> 11:38.600
<b><i>That's all that happened! Nothing more...</i></b>

11:41.890 --> 11:44.810
<b><i>This can't be happening!</i></b>

11:44.810 --> 11:48.060
<b><i>Now I'm the one who's afraid?!</i></b>

11:48.980 --> 11:50.960
<b>I have a message for the other Ants.</b>

11:53.650 --> 11:55.750
<b>If you come anywhere near us,</b>

11:55.750 --> 11:57.500
<b>your lives are over.</b>

12:06.830 --> 12:07.990
<b>That's bull!</b>

12:10.710 --> 12:11.710
<b>Very well.</b>

12:19.530 --> 12:22.100
<b>Then don't bother.</b>

12:48.660 --> 12:49.520
<b>They're gone.</b>

12:55.670 --> 12:57.580
<b><i>Their stuff's still here...</i></b>

12:58.150 --> 12:59.630
<b><i>Were other Ants nearby?</i></b>

13:05.080 --> 13:06.720
<b><i>I don't sense any.</i></b>

13:07.310 --> 13:08.140
<b><i>That means...</i></b>

13:30.720 --> 13:31.910
<b>What are you doing?!</b>

13:32.580 --> 13:35.150
<b>Eh? Can't you tell?</b>

13:35.150 --> 13:37.150
<b>I'm punishing him.</b>

13:37.150 --> 13:40.420
<b>Punishing him for toying with my feelings!</b>

13:41.070 --> 13:42.390
<b>What the hell?</b>

13:42.390 --> 13:45.170
<b>You're the one who's being unreasonable!</b>

13:45.950 --> 13:48.680
<b><i>Well, at least he's okay...</i></b>

13:48.940 --> 13:52.080
<b>Leave us alone! 
This is none of your business!</b>

13:52.080 --> 13:54.590
<b>Right back at you, stupid.</b>

13:54.590 --> 13:56.380
<b>Why don't you make yourself scarce?</b>

14:03.650 --> 14:07.200
<b>Why are you injured?</b>

14:07.390 --> 14:08.280
<b>Huh?</b>

14:08.280 --> 14:11.200
<b>Oh, I was training... Got a problem with it?</b>

14:11.200 --> 14:13.180
<b>I'll injure you some more!</b>

14:16.890 --> 14:18.010
<b>Palm...</b>

14:20.760 --> 14:21.670
<b>Don't bother.</b>

14:22.060 --> 14:25.340
<b>I could dodge your knife in my sleep.</b>

14:27.240 --> 14:30.170
<b>I was so sure he was dead...</b>

14:41.360 --> 14:42.810
<b>Wait!</b>

14:42.810 --> 14:44.530
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

14:51.190 --> 14:52.120
<b>What?</b>

14:52.870 --> 14:55.120
<b>Catch us if you can, stupid!</b>

14:57.400 --> 15:00.260
<b>Wait!</b>

15:03.950 --> 15:05.300
<b>Stop, Killua...</b>

15:05.300 --> 15:08.550
<b>You're just making her angrier.</b>

15:08.550 --> 15:09.410
<b>Huh?</b>

15:09.410 --> 15:12.090
<b>If we ditch her here, we'll never see her again.</b>

15:12.690 --> 15:18.140
<b>We just have to call Knuckle and tell 
him we'll meet him somewhere else.</b>

15:18.610 --> 15:20.390
<b>I'm going back.</b>

15:20.730 --> 15:23.330
<b>Do you want to die?</b>

15:23.330 --> 15:25.430
<b>If you let your guard down,</b>

15:25.430 --> 15:28.420
<b>thinking she's not much of a fighter, 
she'll stab you in the back!</b>

15:29.640 --> 15:31.780
<b>She wouldn't do that.</b>

15:31.780 --> 15:32.710
<b>Huh?!</b>

15:32.710 --> 15:37.230
<b>Bu— Didn't you see her take that knife to me?</b>

15:37.230 --> 15:39.470
<b>Damn, you're too much!</b>

15:44.370 --> 15:47.060
<b>They're making a fool of me!</b>

15:55.580 --> 15:57.840
<b>They think they've escaped me?</b>

15:57.840 --> 15:59.310
<b>Fools!</b>

15:59.980 --> 16:02.350
<b>Wherever you run to, I will know!</b>

16:17.740 --> 16:20.990
<b>Cute, cute mermaid...</b>

16:20.990 --> 16:24.170
<b>Where is that accursed brat, Killua?</b>

16:29.180 --> 16:31.890
<b>There he is, the fool!</b>

16:34.010 --> 16:36.180
<b>The hotel by the station...</b>

16:37.000 --> 16:38.090
<b>Brat...</b>

16:38.090 --> 16:39.420
<b>Brat! Brat! Brat!</b>

16:39.420 --> 16:41.680
<b>He keeps interfering!</b>

16:42.740 --> 16:46.950
<b>If not for him, everything would be fine.</b>

16:57.550 --> 17:01.450
<b>I'll chase him to the end of 
the world and eliminate him!</b>

17:01.450 --> 17:03.060
<b>Make a fool of me, will you?!</b>

17:07.030 --> 17:07.840
<b>Kno—</b>

17:07.840 --> 17:09.150
<b>Knov-sama...</b>

17:09.540 --> 17:11.590
<b>Where did those boys go?</b>

17:12.410 --> 17:14.170
<b>R-Right...</b>

17:14.170 --> 17:17.590
<b>They went to the hotel that 
has a logo with three circles.</b>

17:20.650 --> 17:21.810
<b>This is Knov.</b>

17:21.810 --> 17:23.730
<b>They're at the Triple Circle Hotel.</b>

17:24.490 --> 17:28.760
<b>Yeah, we just got a call from them.</b>

17:29.290 --> 17:33.240
<b>Um, I believe you had planned 
to arrive in two days...</b>

17:34.040 --> 17:35.890
<b>No, we're on schedule.</b>

17:36.440 --> 17:38.990
<b>We'll use the extra two days 
to observe those boys,</b>

17:39.410 --> 17:42.920
<b>to determine if they're ready to 
see Kite in his current state.</b>

17:45.830 --> 17:47.580
<b>But first things first, Palm!</b>

17:47.580 --> 17:48.650
<b>Y-Yes?</b>

17:49.100 --> 17:52.440
<b>It appears that you used your 
power without my permission.</b>

17:53.860 --> 17:58.760
<b>I told you to await my orders, 
in case of unforeseen events.</b>

17:59.340 --> 18:00.380
<b>Yes...</b>

18:02.060 --> 18:05.770
<b>Your blood is an irreplaceable commodity.</b>

18:06.770 --> 18:08.560
<b><i>Irreplaceable?</i></b>

18:10.790 --> 18:12.870
<b><i>Use it only for me.</i></b>

18:13.700 --> 18:16.530
<b><i>Only for Knov-sama...</i></b>

18:17.700 --> 18:18.560
<b><i>Understood?</i></b>

18:22.030 --> 18:23.790
<b><i>Y-Yes.</i></b>

18:25.880 --> 18:29.260
<b><i>Knov-sama really is the only one for me!</i></b>

18:30.400 --> 18:33.050
<b>And why are you dressed like that?</b>

18:33.370 --> 18:35.700
<b>Oh! No reason...</b>

18:35.700 --> 18:37.680
<b>N-Nothing's going on!</b>

18:42.280 --> 18:44.110
<b><i>Irreplaceable...</i></b>

18:46.410 --> 18:51.060
<b>Then tell her to wait until 
Kite's back to normal.</b>

18:51.780 --> 18:53.140
<b>I did.</b>

18:57.230 --> 19:00.490
<b>Gon Freecss, age 12, blood type B,</b>

19:00.850 --> 19:06.290
<b>forced into a relationship by Palm 
Siberia, age 22, blood type A...</b>

19:06.810 --> 19:08.700
<b>and dumped before he knew it.</b>

19:24.510 --> 19:26.750
<b>Meh... Again?</b>

19:26.750 --> 19:27.810
<b>That's the third one.</b>

19:31.810 --> 19:33.810
<b>Oh! A secret one!</b>

19:33.810 --> 19:35.750
<b>Huh? Really?</b>

19:35.750 --> 19:39.920
<b>Yeah, you can auction it on 
the net for a lot of money.</b>

19:40.930 --> 19:42.320
<b>Then you can have it.</b>

19:44.190 --> 19:45.330
<b>Not interested.</b>

19:53.350 --> 19:54.710
<b>Did something happen?</b>

19:54.710 --> 19:56.690
<b>Hmm? Not really.</b>

20:02.110 --> 20:04.090
<b>Let's hit the gym.</b>

20:06.000 --> 20:06.930
<b>Okay!</b>

20:13.620 --> 20:14.580
<b>Well?</b>

20:16.810 --> 20:18.770
<b>Oh, I haven't noticed anything.</b>

20:23.100 --> 20:25.140
<b>They seem to be doing fine...</b>

20:26.700 --> 20:29.510
<b>But we should continue to observe them.</b>

20:30.050 --> 20:33.100
<b>That will give them time to 
conclude their business.</b>

20:35.110 --> 20:39.600
<b>While Knov and Shoot were observing 
the mental state of Gon and Killua...</b>

20:58.200 --> 20:59.180
<b>He's here.</b>

21:21.060 --> 21:22.580
<b><i>Who's this guy?</i></b>

21:28.760 --> 21:29.560
<b>Not bad.</b>

21:45.770 --> 21:46.930
<b>He's fast.</b>

21:51.390 --> 21:54.150
<b>You're faster than the guys 
I fought yesterday.</b>

21:56.370 --> 21:58.040
<b>But not by much.</b>

23:25.200 --> 23:27.380
<b>Next time: Grudge x And x Dread.</b>

23:28.470 --> 23:29.720
<b>Give me more meat!</b>

23:29.720 --> 23:31.090
<b>You eat a lot.</b>
