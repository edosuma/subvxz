01:04.315 --> 01:06.066
Master Li is here!

01:06.443 --> 01:09.194
-Master Li is here!
-Master Li is here!

01:21.958 --> 01:25.169
Shu Lien!

01:27.839 --> 01:30.466
Shu Lien! Li Mu Bai is here!

01:36.014 --> 01:37.765
-Master Li.
-Hello.

01:38.183 --> 01:41.059
-How's everything?
-Fine. Please come in.

01:52.530 --> 01:55.616
-Li Mu Bai. It's been a long time.
-It has.

01:56.576 --> 01:59.578
-How's business?
-Not bad. And how are you?

02:00.038 --> 02:01.205
Fine.

02:05.502 --> 02:08.044
Monk Zheng came by
from the Wudang Mountain.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.756
He said you were practicing
deep meditation.

02:13.009 --> 02:16.595
The mountain must be so peaceful.
I envy you.

02:16.679 --> 02:19.848
My work keeps me so busy
I hardly get a minute's rest.

02:22.018 --> 02:24.937
I broke it off.
I couldn't complete the training.

02:26.231 --> 02:29.733
Why? You're a Wudang fighter.
Training is everything.

02:30.819 --> 02:36.573
During my meditation training,
I came to a place of deep silence.

02:37.617 --> 02:39.743
I was surrounded by light.

02:40.453 --> 02:43.413
Time and space disappeared.

02:44.791 --> 02:48.877
I felt I had come to a place
my master had never told me about.

02:51.339 --> 02:54.508
-You were enlightened.
-Far from it.

02:55.051 --> 02:58.470
I didn't feel the bliss
one should feel when enlightened.

02:58.555 --> 03:02.933
Instead, I was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.

03:04.394 --> 03:07.104
It was more than I could take.

03:07.897 --> 03:11.024
I couldn't go on. I failed.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.821
There was something pulling me
back into the world.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.907
What was it?

03:22.078 --> 03:24.329
Something I can't seem to let go of.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.544
I see you're preparing to leave.

03:31.129 --> 03:35.090
We're making a delivery to Beijing.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.803
Perhaps I could ask you
to deliver something to Sir Te for me.

03:45.143 --> 03:48.270
The Green Destiny Sword?
You're giving it to Sir Te?

03:48.354 --> 03:51.899
I am. He has always been
our greatest protector.

03:51.983 --> 03:54.943
I don't understand.
How can you part with it?

03:55.028 --> 03:57.404
It's been with you a long time.

03:58.573 --> 04:01.158
Too many men have died at its edge.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.372
It may look pure

04:07.540 --> 04:10.250
but only because blood
washes easily from its blade.

04:10.335 --> 04:14.212
You use it for good cause,
making you worthy of it.

04:16.716 --> 04:19.009
It's time for me to leave it behind.

04:20.053 --> 04:22.512
So what will you do then?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.601
Come with me to Beijing.

04:27.977 --> 04:30.938
You can give the sword to Sir Te in person.

04:31.064 --> 04:33.690
It'll be just like old times.

04:35.318 --> 04:38.737
I need to visit my master's grave.

04:39.572 --> 04:43.241
It's been many years since
he was murdered by Jade Fox.

04:43.326 --> 04:48.080
I have yet to avenge his death,
and yet I'm thinking of quitting.

04:48.706 --> 04:51.124
I must pray for his forgiveness.

04:51.793 --> 04:56.088
Catch up with me when you have finished.

04:56.422 --> 04:58.757
I will wait for you if you come.

04:59.884 --> 05:01.176
Maybe.

05:08.810 --> 05:11.436
-Okay, you may pass.
-Thanks.

05:11.521 --> 05:13.397
Let's go into the city. We can rest
after we unload the shipment.

05:24.617 --> 05:27.244
Thank God everything is safe.
Much obliged, Miss Yu.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.622
Just doing my job.

05:30.915 --> 05:34.626
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.

05:35.336 --> 05:39.589
You're a credit to your father's memory.

05:39.841 --> 05:43.093
-Thank you.
-It's the truth.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.256
This is Li's personal sword.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.927
A great hero is worthy of a great weapon.

06:26.262 --> 06:30.640
He is the only one in the world
worthy of it.

06:31.142 --> 06:34.061
It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

06:34.479 --> 06:38.148
The sword has brought Li Mu Bai
as much trouble as glory.

06:38.483 --> 06:41.109
Li wants to leave these troubles behind.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.362
Take the sword and help him
leave his old way of life.

06:44.906 --> 06:47.949
I see. All right.
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

06:51.037 --> 06:53.038
Ninth Level Counsel, Chief Yu has arrived.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.706
I must change.

06:55.333 --> 07:00.295
Thank you. You've always been
a great friend to Li and me.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.964
No hurry to leave. Please feel at home.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.926
You'll stay the night as my guest.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.221
Now, Shu Lien,

07:09.305 --> 07:13.225
tell me something,
and forgive me for prying.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.770
But your father was like a brother to me

07:16.854 --> 07:20.023
and I think of you as my own daughter.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.484
Please, Sir Te, what is it?

07:22.819 --> 07:27.781
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword
and his warrior days,

07:28.574 --> 07:31.368
maybe he's hinting something to you.

07:32.245 --> 07:34.871
-I don't know.
-Don't be coy.

07:35.206 --> 07:38.083
I've known all along about
your feelings for each other.

07:38.167 --> 07:40.585
Neither of you have been brave enough

07:40.670 --> 07:44.339
to reveal your feelings to each other.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.677
So many years went wasted.

07:49.762 --> 07:51.888
Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

07:51.973 --> 07:54.432
Maybe it isn't what you've thought.

07:56.435 --> 08:02.232
When it comes to emotions,
even great heroes can be idiots.

08:03.442 --> 08:07.612
If Li Mu Bai doesn't talk straight
next time you see him,

08:08.739 --> 08:11.575
let me know, and I'll give him an earful!

08:20.418 --> 08:22.377
You will stay in this room.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.384
You?

08:34.724 --> 08:38.143
I am your guest here today.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.981
This is Sir Te's study. You are here to...

08:43.357 --> 08:47.277
It's so crowded out there.
I was looking for a quiet place.

08:48.070 --> 08:52.240
I'm Sir Te's head servant, De Lu.
This is another of our guests.

09:04.921 --> 09:07.881
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal.

09:08.132 --> 09:11.885
It's the handle that's heavy.
And that blade is no ordinary metal.

09:12.053 --> 09:15.305
Still, the sword is the lightest
of all weapons.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.225
You find it heavy because
you're not used to handling them.

09:18.309 --> 09:20.727
No, I've had a lot
of experience with weapons.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.063
My father has security guards
living with us.

09:23.147 --> 09:25.398
They let me play with their weapons.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.944
This scabbard is so beautiful.

09:30.446 --> 09:32.322
Beautiful and yet dangerous.

09:32.406 --> 09:36.159
Once you've seen it tainted with blood,
you'll think otherwise.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.621
It's 400 years old.

09:40.248 --> 09:41.915
It's exquisite.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.377
You said this sword belongs to...

09:45.628 --> 09:47.963
My friend Li Mu Bai.

09:48.506 --> 09:50.423
He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

09:50.508 --> 09:53.009
Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior?

09:53.094 --> 09:57.222
I've heard so much about him.
Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?

09:58.266 --> 10:00.058
It's a long story.

10:01.894 --> 10:06.147
-You must be a sword fighter, too.
-Yes, but I prefer the machete.

10:06.274 --> 10:10.318
This sword fits Li Mu Bai perfectly.

10:12.196 --> 10:13.571
Really.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.743
It must be exciting to be a fighter.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.747
Fighters have rules, too.
Friendship, trust, integrity.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.958
Always keep your promise.

10:25.084 --> 10:27.836
Without rules, we wouldn't survive long.

10:28.838 --> 10:30.964
I've read all about people like you.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.967
Roaming wild,
beating up anyone who gets in your way!

10:34.051 --> 10:37.012
Writers have to write like that
to sell books.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.931
You're just like the characters
in the stories.

10:40.057 --> 10:43.893
Sure, no place to bathe for days,
sleeping on flea-infested beds.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.771
They tell you all about that in those books?

10:46.856 --> 10:48.773
You know what I mean.

10:49.191 --> 10:53.194
I'm getting married soon,
but I haven't lived the life I want.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.574
I've heard of your engagement.
Congratulations.

11:01.245 --> 11:04.998
It's the most important step
in a woman's life, isn't it?

11:06.584 --> 11:10.003
-You are not married, are you?
-What do you think?

11:10.421 --> 11:13.715
No. You couldn't roam around
freely if you were.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.676
I admit you're probably right.

11:49.043 --> 11:50.877
Chief Yu, take a look.

12:02.348 --> 12:07.018
2 feet 9 inches long, 1.1 inch wide.

12:07.186 --> 12:10.480
The handle is 1 inch long, 2.6 inches wide,

12:10.815 --> 12:14.567
0.7 inch thick, each side is 1.5 inches.

12:14.652 --> 12:17.195
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.

12:17.530 --> 12:21.908
You can tell from the design that
it was made during the Qin Wu era.

12:21.992 --> 12:25.120
Engraved with a technique lost
during the Han Dynasty.

12:25.204 --> 12:28.331
Your knowledge is remarkable.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.252
A sword by itself rules nothing.

12:32.461 --> 12:35.463
It comes alive only through
skilful manipulation.

12:36.090 --> 12:39.050
I see your point. Please continue, Sir Te.

12:39.218 --> 12:42.011
The inner city in Beijing is not a problem.

12:42.596 --> 12:46.224
With royalty and officials everywhere

12:46.809 --> 12:51.020
the Royal Guard keep security tight.

12:51.439 --> 12:53.773
But the outer city is hard to govern.

12:53.858 --> 12:57.110
It's full of complex characters.

12:58.154 --> 13:01.197
Proceed with caution
in your quest for law and order.

13:01.282 --> 13:03.658
Don't depend only on the court.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.703
Keep some contacts
in the Jiang Hu underworld.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.581
It can ensure your position.

13:14.211 --> 13:17.672
Be strong yet supple.
This is the way to rule.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.369
Governess.

13:49.914 --> 13:51.164
Let me do it.

13:54.919 --> 13:58.338
-Please sit.
-I've made a pair of silk pajamas.

13:58.422 --> 14:01.299
-Want to change into them?
-Leave them there.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.724
I heard you met Yu Shu Lien today.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.143
You know her?

14:13.354 --> 14:17.190
Your mother would not want you
consorting with her kind.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.570
I'll socialize with whomever I please.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.573
Don't invite danger
into your father's house.

14:28.744 --> 14:31.829
-I'm tired now!
-Go to bed then.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.920
You've grown up
and will get married soon.

14:40.589 --> 14:43.216
God knows what the future will bring.

14:44.176 --> 14:46.010
It'll be just the same.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.596
Enough, I'm tired.

14:53.352 --> 14:56.604
It's autumn now.
I'll shut the windows for you.

15:23.716 --> 15:25.383
Chilly, eh?

16:01.879 --> 16:03.671
Thief!

16:26.362 --> 16:29.322
Someone help! Catch the thief!

16:29.406 --> 16:31.240
He's on the rooftop!

16:33.619 --> 16:36.663
The sword's been stolen! Someone help!

16:37.706 --> 16:39.957
He's on the roof! Stop, thief!

17:04.608 --> 17:07.527
Catch him!

17:08.904 --> 17:10.696
Avenge my mother!

17:13.075 --> 17:16.035
What are you standing here for?
Go get him!

17:18.497 --> 17:21.249
Return the sword, and I'll let you go.

17:26.714 --> 17:29.048
You've been trained at Wudang?

17:32.970 --> 17:35.722
We are street performers. You're wrong.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.516
-We're just practicing the stunts.
-Let's go.

17:39.101 --> 17:42.186
Practicing? Who are you trying to fool?

17:42.771 --> 17:44.522
Where did they go?

17:55.951 --> 17:57.744
Chief Yu's house.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.347
Get down here!

19:57.531 --> 19:58.990
Give me the sword.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.358
Sir Te awaits you in the great hall.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.444
I didn't get the sword back.

21:18.528 --> 21:22.281
But I'm sure the thief's connected
to the Yus.

21:22.366 --> 21:24.075
-How dare you!
-But I saw...

21:24.159 --> 21:25.952
Enough! Get out!

21:37.631 --> 21:39.882
Has Chief Yu ever seen the sword?

21:40.300 --> 21:43.970
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

21:44.554 --> 21:47.556
But the sword is somewhere
in his compound.

21:51.228 --> 21:55.356
Then someone's out to frame him.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.901
We should get word
to Li Mu Bai about this.

22:03.824 --> 22:05.533
Watch your step.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.038
-What is it?
-Someone's put fliers up.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.546
Let me see.

22:25.178 --> 22:29.265
Someone's after Jade Fox.
Preposterous, looking for her here!

22:45.699 --> 22:49.785
-Best spear fighting in the world!
-The Yang School of Spear Fighting!

23:06.053 --> 23:08.929
-Where did they go?
-I really don't know.

23:09.890 --> 23:13.309
I saw them couple of days ago.
Probably gone by now.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.446
Miss, there's a Miss Yu here
asking to see you.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.449
-Our Lady is busy right now.
-I will tell her then.

24:10.534 --> 24:12.034
Show her in.

24:13.662 --> 24:14.829
Yes.

24:19.543 --> 24:22.211
This spells trouble.

24:24.214 --> 24:25.798
I have a guest now.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.182
This way please, Miss Yu.

24:41.231 --> 24:43.482
-I've missed you!
-Missed me? How so?

24:43.567 --> 24:45.151
I have nothing to do.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.160
You're practicing calligraphy.

24:55.245 --> 24:58.414
I'll write your name. Just for fun.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.985
I never noticed that my name
looks like the word for sword.

25:28.069 --> 25:31.864
You write gracefully.
Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.950
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

25:36.953 --> 25:38.245
Please.

25:42.417 --> 25:45.628
Thank you for seeing me.
I hear your wedding day is near.

25:45.921 --> 25:48.130
You must be overwhelmed
with the preparations.

25:48.215 --> 25:51.717
I'm hardly doing a thing.
The less I think of it, the better.

25:52.135 --> 25:56.931
My parents are arranging everything,
including the groom.

25:57.307 --> 26:01.310
Mother says the Gous
are a very powerful family.

26:01.728 --> 26:05.481
My marrying into this family
will give my dad's career a big boost.

26:05.899 --> 26:09.235
It's a great fortune to marry
into such a noble family.

26:10.111 --> 26:14.281
Is it? Actually,
I like the great heroes in the books

26:14.658 --> 26:16.951
just like you and Li Mu Bai.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.495
Marriage is a good thing.

26:19.663 --> 26:22.081
If only I could be free to live my own life,

26:22.165 --> 26:25.834
to choose who I love
and love him in my own way.

26:27.170 --> 26:29.088
That's real happiness.

26:30.632 --> 26:34.468
-Think so? Let me tell you a story.
-About you and Li Mu Bai?

26:34.761 --> 26:38.597
Yes. I was once engaged
to be married when I was young.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.810
-Really?
-His name was Meng Si Zhao.

26:43.311 --> 26:46.021
He was a brother-by-oath to Li Mu Bai.

26:46.481 --> 26:48.691
One day,
while defending Li Mu Bai in battle

26:48.775 --> 26:52.027
he was killed by another man's sword.

26:52.946 --> 26:56.532
After Meng's sacrifice,
Li and I went through a lot together.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.659
Our feelings for each other grew stronger.

26:58.743 --> 27:02.913
But we decided to honor
my engagement to Meng.

27:03.123 --> 27:05.958
The freedom you talk about,
I too desire it,

27:06.293 --> 27:08.210
but I've never tasted it.

27:08.545 --> 27:11.046
It's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.

27:11.214 --> 27:14.550
Too bad for Meng,
but that's just the way things turn out.

27:16.553 --> 27:19.555
As a woman,
I still must abide by tradition

27:19.973 --> 27:24.518
even if I'm not an aristocrat like you.

27:25.145 --> 27:31.025
Don't distance us.
From now on, let's be sisters.

27:32.694 --> 27:37.364
All right. As a sister,
I hope you find real happiness.

28:13.693 --> 28:16.278
Miles and miles of nothing.

28:17.280 --> 28:21.075
Can't your father get an appointment
closer to civilization?

28:21.534 --> 28:22.951
This place!

28:24.079 --> 28:27.623
Jen, are you listening to me?

28:56.486 --> 28:57.820
Let's go!

29:21.886 --> 29:23.971
-Who are you?
-Dad!

29:24.055 --> 29:26.557
Hold it! I'm a friend!

29:30.353 --> 29:33.230
I don't care about your sword.

29:33.314 --> 29:37.693
-Why are you spying on the Yus?
-I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.

29:38.528 --> 29:42.781
I'm a police inspector
from the Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.

29:42.866 --> 29:46.827
This Jade Fox is a master criminal.
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

29:47.036 --> 29:50.581
She must have come with them
when he transferred here.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.667
But I cannot just go in and catch her there.

29:53.751 --> 29:55.711
I have to lure her out.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.838
-This Jade Fox is a woman?
-You bet.

29:57.922 --> 30:00.132
Then leave her to me. Don't worry.

30:00.425 --> 30:03.051
Thank you, but I doubt you can handle her.

30:03.595 --> 30:07.639
My wife used to be quite a martial artist.
Jade Fox killed her.

30:07.724 --> 30:12.394
It's both an official and a personal matter
to me.

30:13.897 --> 30:17.191
-Meatballs are ready!
-I'm more than ready for them.

30:17.942 --> 30:20.277
Wait, dad gets first dip!

30:22.906 --> 30:24.072
Hey!

30:25.074 --> 30:26.617
They are gone.

30:28.286 --> 30:29.661
What does it say?

30:29.746 --> 30:32.956
We'll settle this at midnight tonight
on Cemetery Hill.

30:33.082 --> 30:35.584
Good! The Fox is out of her hole.

30:37.504 --> 30:38.629
Please.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.799
Shu Lien, look who's here.

30:48.681 --> 30:52.267
Sir Te thinks it's not appropriate
to cast doubt on Chief Yu.

30:52.352 --> 30:55.979
But there is something up
in the Yu household. I'm investigating.

30:56.064 --> 30:57.606
What have you found?

31:10.203 --> 31:12.621
Jade Fox? Impossible!

31:12.956 --> 31:15.916
You'd always suspected
she'd fled out west.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.293
She has the nerve to come to Beijing.

31:18.378 --> 31:22.047
Is there any place safer than
under the nose of Chief Yu?

31:24.133 --> 31:27.386
I shall avenge my master's death after all.

31:28.846 --> 31:31.265
But be careful, Li Mu Bai.

31:31.766 --> 31:33.934
Sir Te requires discretion.

31:34.102 --> 31:36.687
Official business is already
difficult to resolve,

31:36.771 --> 31:40.357
it'd be a bigger mess
with your personal matters involved.

31:40.984 --> 31:43.860
And I don't know,
this flyer may not be reliable.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.946
It could be some sort of trap.

31:48.658 --> 31:51.034
-Did you see who posted it?
-No.

31:51.411 --> 31:53.537
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

31:53.955 --> 31:57.833
Sir Te says the night of the theft
there was a brawl in front of Yu's.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.918
Were you involved?

32:00.003 --> 32:03.171
No, that was Bo, Sir Te's man.

32:03.256 --> 32:05.007
Bo followed the thief to the Yus.

32:05.091 --> 32:09.094
-Have you cross-examined him yet?
-Bo? No, not yet...

32:09.178 --> 32:12.097
But you've had your men
stake out Yu's compound?

32:12.849 --> 32:15.267
No, I'd already sent them back.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.563
You can blame me for losing the sword

32:19.647 --> 32:23.191
but trust me, I'll get it back soon
using my own methods.

32:24.861 --> 32:26.653
That's not what I meant.

32:26.738 --> 32:28.947
I don't care about the sword.

32:29.157 --> 32:32.618
How can you say that?
Didn't you come back here for it?

32:33.286 --> 32:36.413
I didn't know it was stolen until I got here.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.666
Then, why did you come?

32:41.878 --> 32:44.379
Well, we had talked...

32:47.925 --> 32:51.386
Pardon my intrusion.
Master Li, your room is ready.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.223
Thank you.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.893
Please, lead the way.

33:08.780 --> 33:11.281
This Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.

33:11.366 --> 33:13.367
There's no sign of her.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.251
Enough! Don't pretend any more.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.883
Tsai! You old scoundrel!

33:30.468 --> 33:32.886
You won't leave me alone. Payback time!

33:32.970 --> 33:35.555
Yeah, old lady? Watch your mouth!

33:35.765 --> 33:38.934
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.

33:39.227 --> 33:42.104
If you resist, you're dead today.

33:42.271 --> 33:45.190
Dad! Let me avenge my mother's death.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.526
You'll end up like her, you little whore!

33:47.610 --> 33:50.278
You old fox!

34:25.481 --> 34:26.648
Dad!

34:56.012 --> 34:59.514
You old fox, you ruined my life.
You won't get away with it.

35:13.863 --> 35:16.239
Watch out for her acupressure!

35:22.205 --> 35:23.830
Sue!

35:32.298 --> 35:34.299
Tsai, you dog!

35:36.719 --> 35:38.720
You even have hidden hands!

35:42.934 --> 35:45.101
-Dad, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

35:45.728 --> 35:48.563
Wudang should have gotten rid of you
long ago.

35:49.065 --> 35:51.191
It's been a long time, Jade Fox!

35:52.276 --> 35:54.611
You probably don't remember me.

35:54.779 --> 35:57.572
But you remember my master.

35:58.449 --> 36:02.702
You infiltrated my clan while I was away.

36:02.787 --> 36:05.455
You poisoned my master
and stole the secret manual.

36:05.540 --> 36:08.583
Now it's time for you to pay!

36:08.960 --> 36:11.545
Your master underestimated us women.

36:11.629 --> 36:14.673
He wouldn't teach me even after
he'd slept with me.

36:14.757 --> 36:18.343
He deserved to die by a woman's hands!

36:58.634 --> 37:01.595
You stole the top secrets
of Wudang's martial arts.

37:01.679 --> 37:04.764
But you've mastered only
the basic moves in the past ten years.

37:04.849 --> 37:07.475
For you to die under Wudang's
sword today

37:09.353 --> 37:10.353
is no disgrace!

37:16.652 --> 37:19.821
My disciple! Fight with me!
We'll kill them all!

37:20.156 --> 37:22.073
-Fox has a disciple!
-I've got to get rid of Tsai!

37:30.499 --> 37:32.000
Who are you?

37:33.961 --> 37:37.297
Why is the Green Destiny Sword
in your possession?

37:37.882 --> 37:40.967
-It's none of your business.
-My name is Li Mu Bai.

37:41.135 --> 37:43.511
The Green Destiny Sword is mine.

37:53.898 --> 37:56.232
Jade Fox can't be your master.

37:56.359 --> 37:58.360
Where did you learn this "Xuan Piu" move?

37:58.444 --> 38:00.362
Piece of cake.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.619
Who is your master?

38:29.392 --> 38:32.060
-Let's go.
-I'll kill them once and for all.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.400
Let's go!

38:40.653 --> 38:41.736
Dad!

38:42.947 --> 38:44.072
Dad!

38:50.746 --> 38:51.788
Dad!

39:03.968 --> 39:05.510
This is Tsai?

39:07.471 --> 39:11.057
My father. Police Inspector from Shaan.

39:12.768 --> 39:16.771
Homicide must be reported to Chief Yu.

39:17.606 --> 39:19.607
In addition, the victim is an officer.

39:19.692 --> 39:23.236
You believe the killer is hiding out
in this compound?

39:24.655 --> 39:26.948
I'd put my life on it, sir.

39:31.162 --> 39:32.704
Come with me.

39:34.498 --> 39:37.292
This needs to be resolved, and quickly.

39:38.169 --> 39:41.129
I'll get into the Yu household and get her.

39:41.505 --> 39:44.424
I'll ferret out this Fox
and her gang in no time.

39:44.508 --> 39:49.137
Too dangerous. Yu is a court official
and in charge of security.

39:49.555 --> 39:52.057
This could ruin his reputation and career.

39:52.141 --> 39:54.476
It might also get Sir Te in trouble.

39:56.479 --> 39:58.438
This calls for the utmost delicacy.

39:58.522 --> 40:04.110
Sir Te, can you find some excuse
to invite Mrs. and Miss Yu over?

40:05.696 --> 40:07.489
What do you have in mind?

40:08.824 --> 40:12.077
The best way to trap a fox
is through her cubs.

40:15.206 --> 40:20.585
Oh, my! Mrs. Te is spoiling us
with all these gifts.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.922
She is being so considerate
to our daughter.

40:24.048 --> 40:27.342
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough
to entertain you today.

40:27.426 --> 40:30.136
I heard Sir Te has lost something.

40:30.346 --> 40:33.223
And now Mrs. Te is not feeling well.

40:33.724 --> 40:36.351
We know who stole the missing item.

40:39.355 --> 40:42.524
If the thief returns it

40:42.858 --> 40:46.194
I'm sure Sir Te will pursue
the matter no further.

40:46.403 --> 40:47.904
That's good.

40:48.197 --> 40:52.367
It's a real annoyance to have
servants who steal.

40:53.035 --> 40:56.788
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people sometimes make mistakes.

40:56.872 --> 40:59.165
Some mistakes can ruin
not only themselves

40:59.250 --> 41:01.584
but their entire family as well.

41:02.795 --> 41:04.712
But don't be too lenient.

41:04.922 --> 41:07.966
Sure. For example,
no mercy will be shown to the murderer

41:08.050 --> 41:10.301
who just turned up in Beijing.

41:10.553 --> 41:13.680
-A murderer?
-Yes,

41:13.848 --> 41:17.559
the very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.

41:17.935 --> 41:21.855
Last night she killed a policeman
who had tracked her for many years.

41:21.939 --> 41:24.566
A female criminal! Now that's news!

41:24.900 --> 41:27.902
You say she killed a policeman?

41:28.404 --> 41:29.821
Yes, from the west.

41:29.905 --> 41:33.575
He went undercover as a street performer,
and followed her here.

41:33.659 --> 41:37.996
I'm no detective, but maybe
the murderer and thief are the same.

41:38.289 --> 41:39.831
I doubt that.

41:40.416 --> 41:44.419
This particular thief is very unusual.

41:44.628 --> 41:47.589
And most likely smarter than a mere killer.

41:59.602 --> 42:03.938
-Greetings, Sir Te.
-Hello, Mrs. Yu.

42:04.273 --> 42:07.650
Let me introduce Li Mu Bai,
the renowned swordsman.

42:08.194 --> 42:10.987
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Yu, Ms Yu.

42:11.113 --> 42:13.615
Ms Yu is getting married soon.

42:16.285 --> 42:17.952
Congratulations.

42:31.884 --> 42:33.885
Why don't you come in?

42:34.136 --> 42:38.473
-I'm standing guard.
-Come in. It's cold.

42:44.647 --> 42:48.149
Come in. We don't have to fear
Jade Fox if we're together.

43:12.841 --> 43:15.343
Isn't it a little late to be out?

43:18.180 --> 43:20.139
You can give the sword to me.

43:20.808 --> 43:22.684
I'll do as I please.

43:25.980 --> 43:29.023
-Where's your master?
-None of your business!

43:55.551 --> 43:57.051
Had enough flying?

44:00.889 --> 44:02.265
You've got potential.

44:02.349 --> 44:06.227
But you've misunderstood
Wudang's secret manual quite a bit.

44:09.231 --> 44:11.733
You need a real master.

44:12.109 --> 44:14.694
A master like you? It's a meaningless title.

44:14.778 --> 44:16.404
You're right, it's all meaningless.

44:16.488 --> 44:19.490
School is meaningless,
the secret manual is meaningless

44:19.575 --> 44:22.577
even this sword.
It is just a state of mind.

44:23.620 --> 44:26.998
Don't talk like a monk
just because you're in a temple. Just fight!

44:27.082 --> 44:30.418
-Then tell me where Jade Fox is!
-Move!

44:44.475 --> 44:47.393
True strength is light as a feather.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.788
No assistance, no growth.

45:07.790 --> 45:10.124
No reaction, no explanation.

45:11.001 --> 45:12.794
No control, no desire.

45:13.087 --> 45:15.797
Give yourself up and find yourself again.

45:16.965 --> 45:19.342
Here's a lesson for you on life.

45:24.473 --> 45:25.848
Go ahead.

45:27.684 --> 45:29.894
Why should I? You need practice.

45:29.978 --> 45:32.647
Learn to defeat movement with stillness.

45:32.981 --> 45:35.775
That way you'll be worthy
of the Green Destiny.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.321
Why do you want to teach me?

45:41.865 --> 45:46.744
I've always wanted a disciple
worthy of the Wudang secrets.

45:48.872 --> 45:51.749
Aren't you afraid that I'd kill you
once I mastered it?

45:51.834 --> 45:55.086
That's a risk I'm willing to take
as your teacher.

45:55.170 --> 45:59.090
Deep down you're good. Even Jade Fox
hasn't been able to corrupt you.

46:00.968 --> 46:04.512
Wudang is a whorehouse!
Keep your lessons to yourself!

46:23.574 --> 46:26.492
You're home late, or should I say early?

46:29.371 --> 46:33.458
Why are you still here?
You've killed a policeman!

46:34.209 --> 46:36.919
You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

46:37.212 --> 46:41.090
They wouldn't have tracked me here
if you hadn't stolen the sword.

46:41.508 --> 46:45.052
You're not a little girl any more.
You thought this would be fun?

46:45.387 --> 46:47.388
I'm in this, and you're in too.

46:47.514 --> 46:49.557
Come with me, Jen.

46:49.683 --> 46:52.101
You don't want to waste your life

46:52.561 --> 46:56.314
as the wife of some pompous bureaucrat.

46:56.857 --> 47:00.610
-As master and disciple, we will rule.
-I'll never live as a thief.

47:00.736 --> 47:02.695
You're already the most wanted thief!

47:02.779 --> 47:04.197
That was just for fun.
Why would I leave, and where?

47:07.242 --> 47:10.828
Wherever we want.
We'd get rid of anyone in our way.

47:10.913 --> 47:13.039
-Even your father.
-Shut up!

47:13.123 --> 47:16.626
That's the underworld fighter lifestyle.
Kill or be killed.

47:17.252 --> 47:19.921
Exciting, isn't it?

47:24.051 --> 47:28.596
-I've fulfilled my obligations to you.
-No, I have.

47:30.349 --> 47:34.101
To have you as my disciple
is the thing in my life I'm most proud of.

47:41.151 --> 47:45.446
You think you've been teaching me
all these years from the manual?

47:45.948 --> 47:48.241
Thank goodness you're illiterate.

47:50.244 --> 47:52.870
I studied the illustrations,
and you studied the words.

47:52.955 --> 47:55.039
You hid the details from me?

47:55.123 --> 47:59.210
You wouldn't have understood it
even if you knew how to read.

47:59.336 --> 48:03.047
You know you've gone
as far as you will go.

48:04.049 --> 48:06.842
I hid my skills from you because
I was afraid you might get hurt.

48:09.346 --> 48:12.348
If it weren't for seeing you fight
with Li Mu Bai,

48:13.392 --> 48:16.811
I'd still be ignorant
of all you've hidden from me.

48:19.690 --> 48:20.898
Governess.

48:22.609 --> 48:25.945
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 10.

48:26.363 --> 48:29.574
You enchanted me with the dream
of the Jiang Hu underworld.

48:29.658 --> 48:32.952
But once I realized I could exceed you,

48:33.704 --> 48:36.289
you can't imagine how frightened I was!

48:36.873 --> 48:40.585
I had no one to guide me,
no one to follow,

48:42.421 --> 48:44.297
no one to learn from.

48:46.383 --> 48:50.261
There will be more
frightening things ahead.

50:02.959 --> 50:06.045
Are you happy now that the sword is back?

50:07.506 --> 50:11.092
I admit, getting it back made me realize
how much I missed it.

50:12.969 --> 50:15.304
But it's not your sword any more, is it?

50:15.389 --> 50:17.264
You gave it to Sir Te.

50:19.184 --> 50:23.688
True. But I must borrow it for one last job.

50:24.564 --> 50:26.941
Jade Fox will die on its edge.

50:30.529 --> 50:35.074
Did you know what you were hiding
when you covered for that girl?

50:35.826 --> 50:39.286
My job was to recover the sword
without embarrassing anyone.

50:39.913 --> 50:44.667
I wasn't about to ruin her life,
or her father.

50:45.127 --> 50:46.627
You did your job well.

50:46.712 --> 50:50.214
The sword is back. But...this girl.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.676
I saw her last night.

50:55.637 --> 50:57.847
I knew you'd be suspicious.

50:58.140 --> 50:59.974
She needs controlling.

51:00.183 --> 51:02.810
She needs real direction and training.

51:03.520 --> 51:06.689
She's an aristocrat's daughter,
she's not one of us.

51:06.815 --> 51:12.319
It will all be over soon.
You'll kill Fox and she'll marry.

51:14.573 --> 51:18.534
That's not her.
She should become a Wudang disciple.

51:19.995 --> 51:22.037
But Wudang doesn't accept women.

51:22.372 --> 51:24.999
For her, perhaps they could make
an exception.

51:25.083 --> 51:29.003
If not, left to her own, I'm afraid
she'll become a poisonous dragon.

51:29.629 --> 51:32.173
It's not our affair.

51:32.507 --> 51:36.635
Even if Wudang accepts her,
her husband might object.

51:40.682 --> 51:45.186
I thought by giving away the sword,
I could escape the Jiang Hu world.

51:45.520 --> 51:48.814
But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

51:50.692 --> 51:52.526
I had hoped so, too.

51:53.069 --> 51:56.197
I wish there were something
I could do to help you.

52:01.369 --> 52:04.038
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.

52:20.889 --> 52:22.097
Freeze!

52:25.685 --> 52:28.020
-Lo!
-Jen!

52:41.284 --> 52:43.410
You shouldn't have come.

52:45.413 --> 52:48.541
With all the traffic
on your rooftop these days

52:49.125 --> 52:53.087
it took me a while to get in here.
I can't wait any longer, Jen.

52:53.213 --> 52:55.047
I was wrong to let you go.

52:56.383 --> 52:59.635
Come with me, back to the desert.
You'll be happy there.

53:00.095 --> 53:02.096
You can do whatever you want.

53:04.599 --> 53:07.726
You have been looking for me all this time?

53:30.333 --> 53:32.459
Jen, stop playing with it.

53:33.795 --> 53:35.546
I won't break it.

53:57.777 --> 53:58.986
Charge!

54:01.823 --> 54:02.990
Stop!

54:03.992 --> 54:05.576
It's Dark Cloud!

54:05.660 --> 54:07.578
Dark Cloud is coming!

54:23.303 --> 54:26.013
Lower the shade, don't be seen!

54:26.097 --> 54:28.098
Don't be afraid, Miss.

54:43.865 --> 54:46.200
Don't touch the women!

55:32.914 --> 55:35.040
Come!

56:23.757 --> 56:24.798
Hey!

56:26.176 --> 56:28.844
Your mother is fine.
Hurry back to your mother.

57:28.363 --> 57:29.655
Hey!

57:30.657 --> 57:33.450
She's mine! Leave her to me!

57:43.878 --> 57:46.839
-Let's take a break.
-Give me back my comb!

57:49.050 --> 57:51.385
Take a break.

57:52.887 --> 57:55.180
You're tired. You need rest.

58:01.229 --> 58:04.523
Your horse needs water.
There's a spring up here.

58:12.073 --> 58:14.741
Well, there was when I last visited.

58:21.708 --> 58:22.875
Your name?

58:24.169 --> 58:27.421
My name is Lo.
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

58:28.214 --> 58:31.550
I'm not that tall or that big,
but I'm quick as lightning.

58:32.010 --> 58:33.177
Here

58:44.898 --> 58:46.398
Give me my comb.

01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:24.913
If you like that, I can make you a bow.

01:00:25.373 --> 01:00:27.499
Great for hunting pheasants.

01:00:27.709 --> 01:00:29.376
They're delicious.

01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:37.592
You need to eat something. Understand?

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:41.638
That way, you'll have the strength to fight.

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:45.017
Understand?

01:00:54.277 --> 01:00:57.446
You'll slowly regain your strength.
Don't rush.

01:03:03.573 --> 01:03:06.867
You have a bad temper.
It's much better this way.

01:03:13.416 --> 01:03:14.875
You coward!

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:21.631
Still in a bad mood? But you're speaking.

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:24.176
What's your name?

01:03:25.761 --> 01:03:28.763
I didn't think the Hans had names like that.

01:04:08.387 --> 01:04:12.641
Relax. If I wanted to do what you think
I want to do, I'd have done it already.

01:04:13.976 --> 01:04:16.102
You must be dying for a bath.

01:04:16.187 --> 01:04:19.481
The water source is far,
and difficult to get to.

01:04:20.316 --> 01:04:22.734
I managed to bring back some fresh water.

01:04:22.818 --> 01:04:25.362
You can wear my clothes
when you are done.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.322
They're clean.

01:04:43.464 --> 01:04:44.923
Don't worry.

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:50.303
I'll sing a song, so you'll know where I am.

01:04:51.889 --> 01:04:54.891
After the bath, you will calm down a little.

01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:59.062
But promise me,
no more rocks on the head.

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:15.221
-All this trouble, just for a comb?
-It's mine.

01:06:16.766 --> 01:06:20.894
And it's worth a lot to me.
But to a barbarian like you, it's nothing.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.981
Not true. I can use it
to pick fleas from my horse.

01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:28.568
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:33.406
I'm sorry, I guessed wrong.

01:06:34.075 --> 01:06:36.159
I thought you were a Han.

01:06:38.287 --> 01:06:39.913
Give me back my comb.

01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:46.670
I don't take orders from anyone.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.803
Give it to me.

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:15.842
One night, when I was a boy

01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:18.886
I saw a thousand stars fall out of the sky.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:23.140
I remember thinking,
where did they all go?

01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:26.770
I'm an orphan.
I used to look for stars alone.

01:08:28.773 --> 01:08:32.524
Maybe if I rode to the other end
of the desert, I'd find them.

01:08:34.653 --> 01:08:37.572
I've been riding in the desert ever since.

01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:41.701
And that little boy became
a fearsome bandit.

01:08:41.786 --> 01:08:45.121
Couldn't find the stars,
so now he steals my comb.

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:49.209
Out there,
you're always fighting for survival.

01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:53.212
You have to gang up
just to stand a chance.

01:08:53.964 --> 01:08:56.883
Slowly, your gang becomes your family.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:01.220
All that Dark Cloud stuff
is just propaganda

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:03.305
but it does make my life easier.

01:09:04.433 --> 01:09:07.100
So you are still the little boy at heart

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:09.103
looking for fallen stars.

01:09:10.898 --> 01:09:16.611
I am a man. And I've found
the brightest star of them all.

01:09:39.635 --> 01:09:42.345
Your father's men are looking for you.

01:10:12.543 --> 01:10:15.420
They're still out there, circling closer.

01:10:17.131 --> 01:10:18.715
Let them look.

01:10:20.009 --> 01:10:22.969
They'll keep looking. It's trouble for me.

01:10:25.139 --> 01:10:27.724
Don't even think of sending me back.

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:31.269
It's up to you.

01:10:31.604 --> 01:10:34.606
You might get tired of this

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:38.818
and start missing your family.

01:10:39.987 --> 01:10:42.989
If we had a daughter,
we'd look for her, too.

01:10:43.157 --> 01:10:44.908
She'd miss us, too.

01:10:50.748 --> 01:10:54.375
Jen, I want you to be mine forever.

01:10:56.378 --> 01:11:00.506
What if I make my mark on the world,
earn your parents' respect?

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.762
We have a legend. Anyone who dares
to jump from the mountain,

01:11:06.055 --> 01:11:08.222
God will fulfill a wish of his.

01:11:08.974 --> 01:11:12.518
A long time ago, a man's parents were ill,
so he jumped.

01:11:13.938 --> 01:11:16.689
He didn't die, wasn't even wounded.

01:11:18.025 --> 01:11:21.194
He just floated away, far away,
never to return.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.822
He knew his wish had come true.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.534
If you believe in it, it will happen.

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:31.454
I've asked Han people, they say,

01:11:31.914 --> 01:11:34.791
"A sincere heart will make
your dreams come true."

01:11:45.427 --> 01:11:47.053
Keep it safe.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:51.057
And return it to me
when we are together again.

01:11:53.602 --> 01:11:54.894
I will.

01:12:02.444 --> 01:12:06.239
If you don't return it to me,
I will have to chase you down.

01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:09.701
And next time, I won't go easy on you.

01:12:21.463 --> 01:12:24.924
Wherever I went,
they always recognized me.

01:12:25.718 --> 01:12:27.301
I really tried.

01:12:30.597 --> 01:12:34.434
I heard you came to Beijing.
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

01:12:35.436 --> 01:12:37.061
So I came.

01:12:38.147 --> 01:12:40.857
I can't let you get married like that.

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:45.194
Go back.

01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:47.405
Jen.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.202
-Don't ever come back.
-This is it?

01:12:55.456 --> 01:12:56.622
Yes.

01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:14.599
We heard noises. Is everything all right?

01:13:14.683 --> 01:13:16.768
Fine. It was just a cat.

01:13:33.869 --> 01:13:36.329
You think Jade Fox will show up?

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.331
She must be nearby.

01:13:38.916 --> 01:13:41.334
But I doubt she'll show herself.

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:47.256
We'll keep our eyes open.
She'll come for the girl sooner or later.

01:14:06.902 --> 01:14:08.736
Jen!

01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:19.122
Go back to Xin Jiang with me.

01:14:24.086 --> 01:14:28.506
Let go of me.

01:14:33.137 --> 01:14:34.387
You're mine.

01:14:34.888 --> 01:14:36.889
Go back to Xin Jiang with me.

01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:52.446
Jen, come back to Xin Jiang with me.

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:02.039
-Tell me. Where is Jade Fox?
-Come with me. Hurry.

01:15:05.961 --> 01:15:09.755
You really thought she'd give it all up
and go back west with you?

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:14.135
-She's mine.
-Whether she's yours or not

01:15:14.428 --> 01:15:18.097
you will be no good to her dead.
With Gou and Yu hunting you,

01:15:18.182 --> 01:15:20.933
it won't be long until
you're in their hands.

01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:23.269
I don't care anymore.

01:15:25.105 --> 01:15:28.274
If you truly loved her,
you wouldn't say that.

01:15:30.444 --> 01:15:32.945
Don't you want to see her again?

01:15:35.449 --> 01:15:39.035
I'll write an introduction for you.
Take it to Wudang Mountain.

01:15:39.203 --> 01:15:41.454
Wait there for news from me.

01:15:43.707 --> 01:15:44.957
Okay.

01:15:53.342 --> 01:15:55.885
When will this end?

01:15:56.136 --> 01:15:58.971
They take it, put it back, and take it again.

01:15:59.139 --> 01:16:02.308
My place is no better than a warehouse.

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:04.560
Come in.

01:16:06.355 --> 01:16:08.814
-Speak.
-Jen Yu's run away.

01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:11.400
The groom found her missing.

01:16:11.485 --> 01:16:14.028
Chief Yu requests your assistance

01:16:14.488 --> 01:16:17.114
since you know
the Jiang Hu underworld so well.

01:16:17.199 --> 01:16:20.201
He wants to find her
and keep her from harm.

01:16:21.245 --> 01:16:24.497
Sir Te, leave this to us. Don't worry.

01:16:43.392 --> 01:16:45.351
What can I serve you?

01:16:47.187 --> 01:16:49.021
This cup is dirty.

01:17:03.537 --> 01:17:08.541
Hi there. May I ask your name?

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:10.876
Long.

01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:15.548
It's young master Long. My apologies!

01:17:16.049 --> 01:17:18.384
I'm Iron Eagle Sung.

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:22.471
This is my fellow brother,
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:26.475
What brings you to Huai An
and where are you headed, Master Long?

01:17:27.936 --> 01:17:30.062
Anywhere there's action.

01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:33.899
In that case,
perhaps we could be of assistance.

01:17:35.277 --> 01:17:36.819
Don't bother.

01:17:38.447 --> 01:17:40.906
You don't seem to be getting our drift.

01:17:42.909 --> 01:17:44.744
So what if I don't?

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:49.623
We have ways of dealing with people
who don't get it.

01:17:58.175 --> 01:18:00.760
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:05.598
He's my defeated foe.

01:18:24.159 --> 01:18:25.534
Some tea.

01:18:55.065 --> 01:18:56.357
Shu Lien.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.735
There's no eternity
to the things we can touch.

01:19:02.072 --> 01:19:03.864
My master used to say,

01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:06.826
"There's nothing we can hold onto
in this world.

01:19:08.578 --> 01:19:11.872
"Only by letting go can we
finally possess what is real."

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:17.002
Even to an old Taoist like you,
not everything is an illusion.

01:19:17.212 --> 01:19:20.798
When you were holding my hand just now,
wasn't that real?

01:19:23.385 --> 01:19:27.763
Your hand is cold and callused
from practicing machetes.

01:19:28.223 --> 01:19:32.935
All these years,
and I've never had the courage to touch it.

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:37.440
Crouching tigers and hidden dragons
are in the underworld

01:19:37.524 --> 01:19:39.692
but so are human feelings.

01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:43.904
Swords and knives harbor unknown
perils, but so do human relationships.

01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:47.867
I gave away the Green Destiny
with sincerity.

01:19:48.034 --> 01:19:50.411
But it brought us more troubles.

01:19:50.537 --> 01:19:53.581
Repressing your feelings
will only make them stronger.

01:19:53.707 --> 01:19:55.416
I can't repress my desire.

01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:58.878
I want to be with you.

01:20:01.548 --> 01:20:03.257
Just sitting like this

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:07.178
gives me a sense of peace.

01:20:25.739 --> 01:20:27.448
Please follow me.

01:20:29.284 --> 01:20:32.578
-I want a clean room.
-There are plenty of rooms.

01:20:34.623 --> 01:20:37.666
-What would you like to eat?
-Some steamed cod, fried ribs,

01:20:37.751 --> 01:20:40.211
meatballs, not too big, with little starch!

01:20:40.295 --> 01:20:43.672
And cabbage soup with shark fins,
plus a bottle of warm rose wine.

01:20:43.757 --> 01:20:46.467
I have to order them from
a bigger restaurant.

01:20:46.593 --> 01:20:48.594
-Hurry then.
-Yes.

01:21:31.304 --> 01:21:32.680
It's him.

01:21:41.523 --> 01:21:43.691
I am Iron Arm Mi.

01:21:43.984 --> 01:21:47.570
I heard a true master has arrived.

01:21:47.654 --> 01:21:49.947
I have come to seek a lesson.

01:22:02.502 --> 01:22:04.003
You asked for it!

01:22:24.357 --> 01:22:26.317
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:45.669
That's amazing technique!
I am Flying Machete.

01:22:45.754 --> 01:22:48.380
Are you related to Southern Crane?

01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:51.842
Southern Duck?
I don't eat anything with two feet.

01:22:52.093 --> 01:22:54.428
Who could remember such lengthy names?

01:22:54.679 --> 01:22:55.721
You!

01:22:55.847 --> 01:23:00.684
If Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe,
why don't you know his master?

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.270
Who are you?

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:08.776
I'm Phoenix Mountain Gou.

01:23:09.694 --> 01:23:13.113
Gou? I hate that name.

01:23:13.281 --> 01:23:15.699
I feel like throwing up
when I hear that name.

01:23:15.784 --> 01:23:20.245
Too bad you're named Gou!
You'll be the first to taste my sword today.

01:23:42.602 --> 01:23:46.605
Hold it! Don't you know Monk Jing?

01:23:47.399 --> 01:23:50.025
A monk eating meat and not reading
scriptures? You need a lesson, too.

01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:54.279
-Who the hell are you?
-I am...

01:23:54.489 --> 01:23:55.739
I am...

01:23:55.824 --> 01:23:57.950
Be careful of her sword!

01:24:00.787 --> 01:24:03.622
...the invincible Sword Goddess

01:24:04.999 --> 01:24:09.586
with the Green Destiny
that has no equal

01:24:14.467 --> 01:24:16.969
be it Li or Southern Eagle.

01:24:18.596 --> 01:24:21.265
Lower your head and ask for mercy!

01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:30.816
I'm the dragon from the desert

01:24:39.951 --> 01:24:42.828
with no trace to be discovered
in my wake.

01:24:53.173 --> 01:24:56.508
Today I fly over Eh-Mei Mountain,

01:24:58.678 --> 01:25:02.347
tomorrow, I'll uproot
the last dregs of Wudang!

01:25:17.822 --> 01:25:21.867
We politely asked for a friendly match,
but she showed no respect

01:25:22.076 --> 01:25:23.368
and started to reproach and attack us.

01:25:23.453 --> 01:25:27.122
My friends offered to come by
and teach her a lesson.

01:25:27.207 --> 01:25:29.374
Her sword is just too powerful.

01:25:29.542 --> 01:25:33.086
I've travelled far and wide,
but I've never met anyone that uncivilized.

01:25:33.171 --> 01:25:37.090
She kept accusing me of being
the brother of Gou Jun Pei.

01:25:37.509 --> 01:25:40.219
Who is this guy Gou, anyway?

01:25:42.055 --> 01:25:43.555
Her husband.

01:25:55.735 --> 01:25:59.613
Sun Security is nearby. Why don't you
go home and see how things are going?

01:25:59.697 --> 01:26:03.200
-What about you?
-I'll look around and catch up later.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:06.703
Not a bad idea.
Let's stay at Sun Security tonight.

01:26:06.788 --> 01:26:08.914
-Get a good night's sleep.
-Yes.

01:26:34.607 --> 01:26:36.275
-You are back.
-Yes.

01:26:40.947 --> 01:26:42.823
You're back, Master!

01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:46.869
-Hello guys. How's home?
-Things are fine.

01:26:46.953 --> 01:26:50.414
-You've been gone a while.
-Something came up. I leave tomorrow.

01:26:50.498 --> 01:26:52.541
-Wei, your wife was due?
-Yes, a baby girl.

01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:55.711
-A girl? Good.
-I'd be happy if she grows up like you.

01:26:57.005 --> 01:26:59.923
-Mrs. Wu.
-You're back!

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:03.218
-How's the arm? Still sore?
-Much better.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.637
I've been worried about you.

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:09.641
Mrs. Wu,
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.

01:27:11.144 --> 01:27:14.062
Really? I'll go and tidy up the room then.

01:27:43.259 --> 01:27:44.718
Sister Yu!

01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:54.519
You came to find me.
Let's find you some proper clothes.

01:27:54.604 --> 01:27:58.148
I'm just borrowing them.
I'm not moving in.

01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:03.195
You get around pretty well.
I don't think you need my clothes.

01:28:04.572 --> 01:28:08.200
I just happened to be around.
I wanted to see how you're doing.

01:28:09.702 --> 01:28:11.203
Sister...

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.875
Now, now.
With all the trouble you've caused,

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.711
now you know what Jiang Hu life
is really like.

01:28:19.796 --> 01:28:22.965
You came here,
that means you think of me as your sister.

01:28:23.049 --> 01:28:26.009
If so, let me give you some sisterly advice.

01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:30.097
You don't have to marry,
you can't just leave your parents.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.475
But they're the ones
who forced me to get married.

01:28:33.559 --> 01:28:37.521
Go back to your parents first.
Then you can decide about Lo.

01:28:39.565 --> 01:28:41.358
You know about Lo?

01:28:49.409 --> 01:28:52.327
He really loves you.

01:28:53.246 --> 01:28:57.207
Come back to Beijing with me.
We'll figure a way out for you.

01:29:01.546 --> 01:29:04.965
-Where is he now?
-Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.

01:29:06.551 --> 01:29:10.262
-Li Mu Bai?
-He sent him to Wudang Mountain.

01:29:11.848 --> 01:29:14.766
So, you're all working together
to set me up.

01:29:14.934 --> 01:29:17.102
Shut up! How dare you accuse us!

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:19.771
From the beginning,
I knew you stole the Green Destiny!

01:29:19.856 --> 01:29:22.274
I've done nothing but protect you
and your family.

01:29:22.442 --> 01:29:24.943
And you've repaid me
with nothing but contempt.

01:29:25.028 --> 01:29:27.904
Li Mu Bai spared you,
and all you do is insult him.

01:29:27.989 --> 01:29:31.408
All we hoped for was a little peace,
and you've ruined it for us!

01:29:31.492 --> 01:29:33.577
You're no sister of mine!

01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:37.706
I don't give a damn.

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:40.792
Friendship is not real anyway.

01:29:40.877 --> 01:29:44.546
But I wonder,
how long could you last as my enemy?

01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.134
Put the sword down.

01:29:59.687 --> 01:30:00.979
Jen!

01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:06.443
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

01:30:17.538 --> 01:30:19.623
Fine. No more friendship.

01:33:35.569 --> 01:33:37.654
That's Li Mu Bai's sword.

01:33:38.948 --> 01:33:41.199
Come and get it if you can.

01:33:41.742 --> 01:33:44.911
You just rely on the Green Destiny
to do your fighting.

01:33:45.496 --> 01:33:48.623
Don't blame the weapon
if you can't fight me.

01:33:52.128 --> 01:33:54.212
Go ahead. Take your pick.

01:33:55.047 --> 01:33:56.172
I'll wait.

01:33:58.551 --> 01:33:59.592
Go ahead.

01:34:54.815 --> 01:34:56.566
Give me the sword.

01:34:58.527 --> 01:34:59.611
Take it!

01:35:04.492 --> 01:35:05.658
Stop!

01:35:08.954 --> 01:35:10.622
You are not worthy of this sword.

01:35:10.873 --> 01:35:13.208
Not another lecture! On guard!

01:35:15.628 --> 01:35:19.422
-Stop yourself before I do.
-Now the sword will settle it.

01:35:55.042 --> 01:35:59.671
I didn't force you at the monastery
because I wanted to see the real you.

01:36:05.261 --> 01:36:08.263
What do you know about seeing
a true heart?

01:37:50.115 --> 01:37:53.201
-Why can't you leave me alone?
-I'll say it again,

01:37:53.285 --> 01:37:54.994
let me teach you.

01:38:27.611 --> 01:38:30.989
Okay, if you can take back the sword
in three moves

01:38:31.991 --> 01:38:34.033
I will go with you.

01:38:38.122 --> 01:38:40.123
-Give it back.
-Greet your master.

01:38:40.207 --> 01:38:42.458
-You wish.
-Then the sword is useless.

01:39:57.951 --> 01:40:01.579
It's only a matter of time before
those guys get their revenge.

01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:05.625
Your parents value their reputation.
They'll never take you back.

01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:13.216
What good's a home? You've gone so far.
Now we can go all the way together.

01:40:13.926 --> 01:40:16.010
You'll always be my Lady.

01:40:19.014 --> 01:40:22.934
After all, happiness is the most
important thing in life, isn't it?

01:40:23.143 --> 01:40:25.645
We'll be our own masters at last.

01:40:26.271 --> 01:40:29.399
All we have left is each other, isn't that so?

01:40:34.113 --> 01:40:36.030
Now lie down and rest.

01:40:58.887 --> 01:41:01.764
Crazy girl like that,
you should have killed her.

01:41:01.849 --> 01:41:03.975
I didn't have the heart to do it.

01:41:04.101 --> 01:41:06.269
Maybe Li Mu Bai can do it.

01:42:17.132 --> 01:42:19.509
Is it me or the sword you want?

01:42:39.863 --> 01:42:41.739
You've been drugged.

01:42:59.633 --> 01:43:01.342
Where's Jade Fox?

01:43:43.844 --> 01:43:45.553
What's going on?

01:43:46.638 --> 01:43:48.514
Jade Fox drugged her.

01:43:49.057 --> 01:43:50.933
How did you get here?

01:43:53.103 --> 01:43:54.979
We followed Jade Fox.

01:43:57.900 --> 01:43:58.691
Watch out!

01:43:58.692 --> 01:43:59.400
Watch out!

01:44:09.494 --> 01:44:10.912
Governess!

01:44:25.177 --> 01:44:27.136
This is the end of the road.

01:44:29.389 --> 01:44:31.140
For you too.

01:44:39.483 --> 01:44:41.275
A poisoned needle!

01:44:44.988 --> 01:44:46.822
You deserve to die

01:44:48.575 --> 01:44:50.409
but I was really

01:44:50.869 --> 01:44:53.287
aiming at Jen.

01:44:55.165 --> 01:44:57.166
Ten years I sacrificed

01:44:57.542 --> 01:44:59.585
but you deceived me.

01:45:00.671 --> 01:45:04.256
You hid the book's true meaning.
I never improved

01:45:05.676 --> 01:45:09.345
but your progress was limitless.

01:45:11.556 --> 01:45:13.557
You know what poison is?

01:45:14.309 --> 01:45:17.144
An eight-year-old girl who's full of deceit!

01:45:17.646 --> 01:45:19.355
That's poison!

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:24.485
Jen!

01:45:26.321 --> 01:45:27.822
My only love,

01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:30.741
my only enemy!

01:45:40.252 --> 01:45:43.546
You can't die! Tell us,
what poison did you use?

01:45:43.755 --> 01:45:45.381
What poison?

01:45:45.882 --> 01:45:48.426
You can't die, tell us the antidote!

01:45:48.719 --> 01:45:51.429
You can't let him die! Li Mu Bai can't die!

01:45:51.555 --> 01:45:53.889
-It's the Purple Yin Poison.
-What?

01:45:54.766 --> 01:45:58.102
Purple Yin Poison.
It goes straight to the heart.

01:46:01.023 --> 01:46:04.567
My blood will stop flowing
within two hours.

01:46:06.278 --> 01:46:09.280
It's the same poison that killed my master.

01:46:10.949 --> 01:46:14.201
-There's no antidote.
-There must be an antidote!

01:46:14.786 --> 01:46:18.456
Every living thing has its antithesis.
And not this?

01:46:19.791 --> 01:46:22.543
There is. Fox taught it to me.

01:46:23.045 --> 01:46:27.465
The recipe isn't complicated, but the
ingredients are hard to find. It takes time.

01:46:34.473 --> 01:46:36.140
Please, trust me.

01:46:36.641 --> 01:46:39.810
As you have helped me, let me help him.

01:46:42.481 --> 01:46:44.440
All right. Hurry up.

01:46:44.983 --> 01:46:47.234
Maybe I can hold on for two hours.

01:46:47.319 --> 01:46:49.904
Ride my horse to headquarters.
They have the ingredients.

01:46:49.988 --> 01:46:52.490
Give this to Mrs. Wu.
She'll help you. Hurry!

01:46:52.949 --> 01:46:56.327
Save your breath.
Guard your energy. I'll be back.

01:47:21.937 --> 01:47:23.604
Who is this?

01:47:25.899 --> 01:47:28.275
Mrs. Wu! Where's Mrs. Wu?

01:47:28.485 --> 01:47:29.819
Stop it!

01:47:31.196 --> 01:47:33.989
Yu gave me this
and told me to come to you.

01:47:35.117 --> 01:47:36.826
Let her come in!

01:47:50.715 --> 01:47:53.050
Mu Bai, hold on.

01:47:57.556 --> 01:47:59.348
Give me some hope.

01:48:24.249 --> 01:48:25.708
Shu Lien.

01:48:27.252 --> 01:48:29.336
Don't waste your breath.

01:48:31.256 --> 01:48:33.215
My life is departing.

01:48:35.010 --> 01:48:37.094
I've only one breath left.

01:48:39.598 --> 01:48:42.266
Use your last bit of strength to meditate.

01:48:42.767 --> 01:48:47.271
Free yourself from this world
as you've been taught.

01:48:48.899 --> 01:48:53.068
Let your soul rise to eternity
with your last breath.

01:48:55.238 --> 01:48:58.407
Don't waste it on me.

01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:04.455
I've already wasted my whole life.

01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:08.626
I want to tell you
with my remaining strength

01:49:10.462 --> 01:49:12.796
that I love you. I always have.

01:49:48.583 --> 01:49:52.503
I'll drift next to you everyday as a ghost

01:49:53.922 --> 01:49:55.756
just to be with you.

01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:01.762
Even if I was banished
to the darkest place,

01:50:04.307 --> 01:50:05.516
my love

01:50:09.104 --> 01:50:12.982
will keep me from being a lonely spirit.

01:51:09.122 --> 01:51:10.581
He's gone?

01:51:39.903 --> 01:51:41.445
Bo,

01:51:42.113 --> 01:51:44.740
please take this sword back to Sir Te's.

01:51:51.956 --> 01:51:56.210
You may go to Wudang Mountain.
Lo awaits you there.

01:51:57.670 --> 01:52:01.924
Promise me whatever path
you decide to take in this life,

01:52:03.093 --> 01:52:04.927
be true to yourself.

01:52:52.684 --> 01:52:53.851
Jen!

01:53:54.704 --> 01:53:55.787
Jen.

01:53:59.459 --> 01:54:02.127
Remember the story
you told me in the desert?

01:54:04.422 --> 01:54:07.424
Have faith, then the dreams will come true.

01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:15.390
Make a wish, Lo.

01:54:17.936 --> 01:54:21.438
I wish that we'll be in the desert,
together again.
