SHE'S CARRYING
A 16-WEEK-OLD FETUS.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.041
MOM HAVE ANY BRAIN ACTIVITY?

04:14.083 --> 04:15.709

04:17.583 --> 04:19.041

IS THIS SHANNON?

04:24.291 --> 04:25.917
YOU KNOW HER?

04:25.959 --> 04:27.458
SHE'S AN ORGAN DONOR, JAKE.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.709
YEAH,
MY PATIENT NEEDS HER HEART.

04:29.750 --> 04:38.500
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

04:38.542 --> 04:41.959
I WORKED WITH SHANNON
AND HER HUSBAND FOR FOUR YEARS,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.333
MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF I.V.F.
THIS BABY IS THEIR MIRACLE.

04:44.375 --> 04:47.041
A 16-WEEK-OLD MIRACLE
WHO'S NOT YET VIABLE.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.583
MY PATIENT HAS CARDIOMYOPATHY--

04:48.625 --> 04:50.583
STATUS 1A, DESPERATELY NEEDS
A NEW HEART.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.583
SO YOU DO A RISKY TRANSPLANT
ON YOUR PATIENT.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.041
IF SHE'S LUCKY,
SHE GETS WHAT, TEN YEARS?

04:54.083 --> 04:55.959
THIS BABY
CAN HAVE A FULL LIFE.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.709
IF IT EVEN SURVIVES.
THE MOTHER'S BRAIN-DEAD.

04:57.750 --> 04:58.959
CAN THE BABY MAKE IT?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.500
IT'S A LONG SHOT.

05:00.542 --> 05:02.000
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE?

05:02.041 --> 05:03.291
IT'S POSSIBLE, YES,
BUT IT DOESN'T JUSTIFY

05:03.333 --> 05:05.041
TURNING THE MOTHER
INTO A HUMAN INCUBATOR.

05:05.083 --> 05:08.041
SO WHAT, YOU'D RATHER JUST
PULL THE PLUG ON THIS WOMAN?

05:08.083 --> 05:09.750
WOULD I RATHER? NO.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.875
BUT THE REALITY IS, SHE PROBABLY
WON'T SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH

05:11.917 --> 05:14.875
TO BRING THE BABY TO VIABILITY,
AND EVEN IF SHE DOES,

05:14.917 --> 05:16.542
THE PLACENTAL BLOOD FLOW
AND FETAL OXYGENATION

05:16.583 --> 05:18.041
MIGHT BE COMPROMISED,

05:18.083 --> 05:20.000
BOTH OF WHICH ARE CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT TO THE FETUS.

05:20.041 --> 05:21.333
SHE SIGNED THE DONOR CARD

05:21.375 --> 05:23.834
SO SHE COULD SAVE
A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH HER ORGANS.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.417
AND I KNOW THIS WOMAN WANTS
THIS BABY MORE THAN ANYTHING.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.917
WELL, SHE'S NOT GONNA
BE AROUND TO RAISE IT.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.709
BUT HER HUSBAND CAN.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.041
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

05:31.083 --> 05:33.333
(sighs deeply) THEY'RE TAKING
SOME TIME APART.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.333
ACTUALLY,
IT'S BEEN ABOUT A YEAR.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.000
THE STRESS
OF THE FERTILITY TREATMENTS

05:37.041 --> 05:38.625
WAS REALLY HARD ON THEM,

05:38.667 --> 05:41.709
SO DOUG TOOK OFF, AND SHANNON'S
BEEN TRYING ON HER OWN.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.000
OKAY. SO THE HUSBAND'S
NOT IN THE PICTURE,

05:43.041 --> 05:45.000
AND SHE'S--SHE'S BRAIN-DEAD.

05:45.041 --> 05:46.208
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING THIS?

05:46.250 --> 05:47.959
THE POINT IS MOOT.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.917
WITHOUT A FAMILY MEMBER TO MAKE
AN AFFIRMATIVE DECISION,

05:49.959 --> 05:52.041
THE HOSPITAL HAS TO RELY ON
THE INTENT OF THE DONOR CARD.

05:52.083 --> 05:54.667
IN 24 HOURS,
WE'LL DO A REPEAT E.E.G.,

05:54.709 --> 05:56.959
CERTIFY BRAIN DEATH,
AND SHANNON BECOMES A DONOR.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.041
WHAT IF I FIND DOUG?

05:58.083 --> 06:00.000
YOU BETTER DO IT FAST.

06:00.041 --> 06:03.000
(indistinct conversations)

06:09.834 --> 06:10.875
HEY.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.208

06:12.250 --> 06:14.000

06:16.041 --> 06:17.041
THERE WAS NO SCHOOL?

06:17.083 --> 06:20.041
WELL, THERE'S A SCHOOL.
OPEN IT IS NOT.

06:20.083 --> 06:21.750

06:21.792 --> 06:23.333

06:23.375 --> 06:25.583
FORGOT TO MENTION
IT'S TEACHER PLANNING DAY.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.041
(imitates Yoda) SO HANG OUT
WITH MASON TODAY I MUST.

06:27.083 --> 06:29.417
(chuckles) I WILL PICK HIM UP
AROUND 6:30.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.041

06:36.083 --> 06:37.583

06:41.083 --> 06:42.000
NO.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.250

06:43.291 --> 06:46.291

06:48.083 --> 06:49.667

06:51.083 --> 06:53.041

HOW'S IT FEEL, BEING BACK?

06:58.542 --> 07:01.625
OH, IT'S A RELIEF.
I REALLY MISSED BEING HERE.

07:01.667 --> 07:04.041
AND I HAD ENOUGH
OF BEING AT HOME.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.542
DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT?

07:05.583 --> 07:08.125
NO. I-I JUST WANT
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.291
OKAY.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.041
SO, UH,
ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS

07:11.083 --> 07:13.041
FOR, UH,
REINSTATING MY LICENSE

07:13.083 --> 07:16.834
IS TO HAVE A PERIOD
OF PRACTICE SUPERVISION.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.750
WELL, I'D--I'D BE HONORED.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.041
I MEAN,
IF--IF YOU'RE ASKING ME.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.041

07:21.083 --> 07:24.041
YOU KNOW, I'VE SUPERVISED
A FEW THERAPISTS BEFORE.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.750
JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND,
IT'S MORE OF A FORMALITY.

07:25.792 --> 07:28.041
JUST DOTTING THE I's,
CROSSING THE T's.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.041
ACTUALLY, IT'S, UH,
A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.041
YOU KNOW, IT CAN BE A VALUABLE
EXPERIENCE FOR THERAPISTS

07:33.083 --> 07:34.542
WHO WANT TO
SHAKE THE RUST OFF,

07:34.583 --> 07:38.542
PROVIDED BOTH PARTIES
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, OF COURSE.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.041
OF COURSE.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.000
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.542

NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.500
HEY.

08:05.542 --> 08:07.542
MASON'S MY SON.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.041
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

08:09.083 --> 08:10.625
WE JUST WASHED OUR HANDS.

08:10.667 --> 08:13.041
WHATEVER. (chuckles)

08:13.083 --> 08:15.917
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:15.959 --> 08:17.834
YOU DOING OKAY?

08:17.875 --> 08:20.041
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

08:20.083 --> 08:22.041
NO, I JUST HEARD
THAT YOU QUIT YOUR JOB

08:22.083 --> 08:23.417
AND YOU'RE HANGING OUT
WITH SOME GUY.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.125
HIS NAME IS RYAN
AND HE'S GREAT.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.834
AND DID RYAN
QUIT HIS JOB, TOO?

08:27.875 --> 08:30.291
OKAY, DON'T START
GETTING ALL JUDGMENTAL.

08:30.333 --> 08:32.333
YOU KNOCKED UP SOME RANDOM CHICK
IN A BAR PARKING LOT.

08:32.375 --> 08:33.500
HEY.

08:33.542 --> 08:37.041
REALLY, AMELIA?

08:37.083 --> 08:40.291
SORRY.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.959
ENJOY YOUR TACOS.

08:42.041 --> 08:43.041
YEAH.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.959
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:45.000 --> 08:49.041
SHE DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM LIKE A DOCTOR.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.750
YEAH, I KNOW.

08:54.625 --> 08:57.125
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

08:57.166 --> 08:59.625
(indistinct conversations)

08:59.667 --> 09:01.542
(laughs)

09:01.583 --> 09:04.417
SAM, YOU, UH, YOU PAGED ME?

09:04.458 --> 09:06.041
YEAH, JUST WANTED YOU
TO MEET THE SCHAEFFERS.

09:06.083 --> 09:10.041
DR. REILLY, THIS IS MIKE.
HE'S A MED STUDENT.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.041
STUDIES WAY MORE
THAN I EVER DID.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.250
AND HERE WE HAVE J.J.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.917
HE'S GONNA BE A NURSE.

09:15.959 --> 09:17.166
(J.J.) SHUT UP.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.000
AND THIS...

09:19.041 --> 09:21.083
I'M LEE ANN.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.625
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,
DR. REILLY.

09:23.667 --> 09:24.875
SAME HERE.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.041
(Mike) ARE YOU
ON THE TRANSPLANT TEAM, TOO?

09:26.083 --> 09:27.875
DO--DO YOU THINK
WE'LL GET THE HEART TODAY?

09:27.917 --> 09:29.375
(Lee Ann) I CAN'T WAIT
TO GO BACK

09:29.417 --> 09:32.875
TO TAKING CARE OF MY KIDS AGAIN.
(chuckles)

09:32.917 --> 09:34.417
INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.709
LISTEN, GREAT MEETING YOU GUYS.
UM, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

09:36.750 --> 09:38.041
I HAVE TO HAVE A WORD
WITH DR. BENNETT

09:38.083 --> 09:40.166
OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE.

09:40.208 --> 09:43.208
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

09:45.083 --> 09:46.583
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

09:46.625 --> 09:48.709
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO MEET THEM.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.041
OR MAYBE YOU JUST THOUGHT

09:50.083 --> 09:51.542
YOU COULD GUILT ME
INTO CHANGING MY MIND.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.125
JAKE, IF LEE ANN
DOESN'T GET THAT HEART

09:53.166 --> 09:56.041
IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO, IT'S NOT
JUST HER LIFE THAT'S DESTROYED.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.625
THOSE KIDS--THEY NEED HER.

09:57.667 --> 10:00.125
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
A FIRST-YEAR INTERN, SAM.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.041
I'M YOUR COLLEAGUE
AND YOUR FRIEND.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.542
AND THAT?

10:03.583 --> 10:06.000
THAT WAS NOT COOL.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.041
GENTLEMEN, MEET MY SON MASON.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.667
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

10:15.709 --> 10:18.125
CLEARLY, HE HAS HIS MOTHER'S
MANNERS. HEY, I'M PETE.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.500
I'M SHELDON.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.041
(chuckles)

10:22.083 --> 10:23.709
(chuckles)

10:23.750 --> 10:26.250
WHY ARE YOU ALL SMILING AT ME?

10:26.291 --> 10:27.583
WELL, YOU'RE SUCH A...

10:27.625 --> 10:28.750
MINI COOPER.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.291
YEAH, I KNOW.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.250
NEW HIRE?

10:31.291 --> 10:33.709
HI. I'M MASON.
COOPER'S MY DAD.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.875
HELLO. I'M ADDISON.

10:35.917 --> 10:38.250
WE WENT FOR TACOS.
YOU WANT ONE?

10:38.291 --> 10:41.250
UH, YES,
THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.500
THANK YOU. (chuckles)

10:43.542 --> 10:46.041
OH, YEAH, AND WE BUMPED INTO

10:46.083 --> 10:48.041
AMELIA AND... RYAN.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.125
WHAT'S HE LIKE?

10:49.166 --> 10:51.250
HANDSOME BUT SHIFTLESS.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.667
(Cooper) MASON.

10:52.709 --> 10:54.875
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
YOU SAID IT IN THE CAR.

10:54.917 --> 10:56.291
WELL, I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.208
SO AMELIA'S SKIPPING WORK,
SHE'S HANGING OUT WITH THIS GUY.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.959
YOU THINK SHE'S, UM...

11:00.000 --> 11:02.208
EATING TACOS AGAIN?

11:02.250 --> 11:04.500
(Addison) EATING TACOS?

11:04.542 --> 11:06.959
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS A HISTORY.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.333
WITH TACOS--
SHE DOESN'T DIGEST THEM WELL.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.041
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
YEAH, UH, WELL,

11:12.083 --> 11:13.792
UM, I DON'T KNOW,

11:13.834 --> 11:16.041
BUT I SUSPECT THAT SHE IS...

11:16.083 --> 11:18.041
DRINKING SODA AGAIN.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.500
SODA OR MARGARITAS?

11:20.542 --> 11:22.333
(lowered voice) BECAUSE I THINK
WE CAN SAY "MARGARITAS."

11:22.375 --> 11:24.291
OKAY, WELL, FINE.
SHE'S DRINKING MARGARITAS.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.041
ARE YOU SURE?
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

11:26.083 --> 11:29.083
WELL, SHE LOOKED
PRETTY HUNGOVER THIS MORNING.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.041
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE
ANY TACO USAGE?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.625
MARGARITAS ARE BAD ENOUGH,

11:31.667 --> 11:34.375
BUT IF IT'S TACOS,
SHE COULD BE IN BIG TROUBLE.

11:34.417 --> 11:36.375
I THINK TACOS ARE GOOD.

11:36.417 --> 11:40.500
BUT, MM, THAT DOCTOR KINDA
LOOKED LIKE A DRUGGIE TO ME.

11:42.083 --> 11:43.792
(sniffs)

11:49.083 --> 11:51.959
SO YOUR BOYFRIEND
JUST BLINDSIDED ME.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.125
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:53.166 --> 11:54.875
PAGED ME
TO HIS PATIENT'S ROOM

11:54.917 --> 11:56.208
SO I COULD MEET THE WOMAN
WHO NEEDS A HEART,

11:56.250 --> 11:58.125
LISTEN TO HER TWO BOYS
THANK ME FOR HELPING HER.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.834
OKAY,
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SAM.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.834
YEAH, IT SURPRISED ME, TOO.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.166
WELL, MAYBE YOU MISUNDERSTOOD
HIS INTENTIONS?
(elevator bell dings)

12:04.208 --> 12:06.375
OH, I DOUBT THAT.
LOOK, HE WANTS SHANNON'S HEART.

12:06.417 --> 12:09.041
HE'S GONNA DO ANYTHING HE CAN
TO GET IT. ADDISON.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.583
I'M SORRY. I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

12:11.625 --> 12:14.291
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.709
TWO YEARS
I WORKED ON THAT CASE.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.041
TWO YEARS OF NIGHTS
AND WEEKENDS

12:19.083 --> 12:21.041
AND "SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE IT
TO DINNER" EXCUSES

12:21.083 --> 12:22.458
TO MY FAMILY...
(chuckles)

12:22.500 --> 12:24.500
THEN THAT BASTARD
SCREWS ME OUT OF THE TRIAL

12:24.542 --> 12:26.250
BECAUSE SUDDENLY
IT SEEMED WINNABLE.

12:26.291 --> 12:29.041
HOW'D THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

12:29.083 --> 12:30.041
PISSED.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.291
I WAS FRUSTRATED.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.166
WELL, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY PAINFUL

12:33.208 --> 12:35.083
TO HAVE SOMETHING YOU WORKED
SO HARD ON GET TAKEN AWAY.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.667
AND HE TOOK CREDIT
FOR ALL OF MY WORK.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.875
YOU KNOW, I HAD THAT
HAPPEN TO ME ONCE.

12:39.917 --> 12:41.959
IT WAS, UH, A PAPER
THAT I'D WRITTEN,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.291
AND MY SUPERVISOR...

12:43.333 --> 12:45.458
(clicks pen)

12:45.500 --> 12:48.417
W-WHEN I FIND MYSELF
IN A SITUATION

12:48.458 --> 12:51.417
WHERE MY PROFESSIONAL SPACE IS
NOT BEING RESPECTED,

12:51.458 --> 12:54.500
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO RE--

12:58.083 --> 13:00.917
DEEP-BREATHING EXERCISES
ARE AN EFFECTIVE WAY

13:00.959 --> 13:02.417
OF HANDLING UNEXPECTED STRESS.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.041
LET'S TRY ONE NOW, SHALL WE?

13:04.083 --> 13:06.417
(inhales deeply) DEEP BREATH.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.208
(clicks pen)

13:08.250 --> 13:09.500
(exhales deeply)

13:09.542 --> 13:10.291
READY?

13:10.333 --> 13:11.333
BRING IT.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.000
OH, MY GOD.

13:13.041 --> 13:15.291
(slurps)

13:15.333 --> 13:17.375
(gate latch clicks)

13:20.500 --> 13:23.000
AMELIA.

13:23.041 --> 13:26.041
HEY, YOU'RE BACK.
YOU WANNA JOIN?

13:26.083 --> 13:27.250
NO.

13:27.291 --> 13:29.250
YOUR LOSS.

13:29.291 --> 13:33.291
WE NEED TO TALK. NOW.

13:33.333 --> 13:36.250
I'LL JUST...
GO GET SOME MORE LIMES.

13:36.291 --> 13:39.041
(clears throat)

13:39.083 --> 13:41.125
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK.
YOU WANT TO LECTURE,

13:41.166 --> 13:43.166
AND HONESTLY,
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.709
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY,
MOST OF WHICH I HAVE SPENT

13:45.750 --> 13:47.959
HAVING MIND-BLOWING SEX
WITH A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE

13:48.000 --> 13:50.291
HE WALKED OFF
A CALVIN KLEIN BILLBOARD.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.792
I THINK YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,
AMELIA.

13:52.834 --> 13:56.000
WELL, IF THIS IS TROUBLE,
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

13:56.041 --> 13:58.834
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU
AND I LOVE YOU,

13:58.875 --> 14:02.709
AND WE ARE FAMILY, AND FAMILY
LOOKS OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.000
WE STOPPED BEING FAMILY
WHEN YOU STARTED SLEEPING

14:05.041 --> 14:08.000
WITH MY BROTHER'S BEST FRIEND
WHILE YOU WERE STILL MARRIED.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.500
I'M NOT THE ENEMY.
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.

14:12.542 --> 14:16.083
WELL, CONSIDER YOURSELF
OFF THE HOOK.

14:16.125 --> 14:19.375
RYAN, WE'RE LEAVING.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.542
(monitor beeping erratically)

14:24.583 --> 14:25.875
(Sam) OKAY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

14:25.917 --> 14:27.375
SHE DROPPED HER SATs.
COULDN'T VENTILATE HER.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.458
(beeping continues)

14:29.500 --> 14:31.166
ALL RIGHT, DELAYED BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.125
I'M GONNA PUT IN A CHEST TUBE.
NO OFFENSE, DR. REILLY,

14:33.166 --> 14:34.875
BUT WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU DID THAT?

14:34.917 --> 14:37.125
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
WE'RE JUST DELAYING
THE INEVITABLE HERE.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.041
I SPOKE TO HER HUSBAND.
HE'S FLYING IN FROM LONDON.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.041
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS KEEP HER
ALIVE UNTIL HE GETS HERE.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.041
TUBE'S READY.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.875
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
THIS IS INSANE.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.875
SAM.
WHAT'S INSANE IS YOU AMBUSHING
ME WITH LEE ANN AND HER FAMILY.

14:46.917 --> 14:48.792
JUST WANTED YOU TO SEE
WHAT THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS

14:48.834 --> 14:51.208
LOOKS LIKE.
WHAT ABOUT
SHANNON'S HUSBAND'S SIDE, HMM?

14:51.250 --> 14:52.667
WHAT ABOUT HIS?

14:52.709 --> 14:54.625
OKAY.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.667
(beeping continues)

14:59.041 --> 15:02.041
(second monitor beeps)

15:02.083 --> 15:04.500
(beeping normalizes)

15:04.542 --> 15:06.417
THIS WOMAN IS GONE, JAKE.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.250
MY PATIENT IS AT THE TOP
OF THE U.N.O.S. LIST,

15:09.291 --> 15:10.709
WAITING FOR HER HEART,

15:10.750 --> 15:12.917
AND YOU'RE JUST WORRIED ABOUT
HER HUSBAND'S FEELINGS.

15:12.959 --> 15:15.041
ALL IT'S GONNA DO
IS COST MY PATIENT HER LIFE.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.458
HER HUSBAND DOESN'T HAVE
THAT RIGHT, AND NEITHER DO YOU.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.208
(beeping continues)

15:26.333 --> 15:27.834
SO WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR
ARE YOU?

15:27.875 --> 15:30.959
I'M A NEUROSURGEON.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.500
(giggles)

15:32.542 --> 15:34.041
SERIOUSLY?

15:34.083 --> 15:36.500
I COULD CUT INTO YOUR BRAIN
RIGHT NOW FOR KICKS.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.667
IN THIS HOTEL ROOM? WOW.

15:38.709 --> 15:41.125
(laughs)

15:41.166 --> 15:43.417
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:43.458 --> 15:44.875
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

15:44.917 --> 15:46.208
ME? OKAY.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.333
I'M OVERPRIVILEGED,
OVERFUNDED,

15:48.375 --> 15:51.250
UNDERMOTIVATED.

15:51.291 --> 15:54.417
KIND OF THE OPPOSITE
OF A DOCTOR.

15:54.458 --> 15:57.333
YOU'RE SAYING, YOU'RE
UNEMPLOYED BUT YOU GOT BANK.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.333
I'M SAYING,
I'M THE FAMILY DISAPPOINTMENT,

15:59.375 --> 16:01.917
BUT YEAH, YOU COULD PUT IT
THAT WAY, TOO.

16:01.959 --> 16:06.375
I WAS THE FAMILY DISAPPOINTMENT
ONCE UPON A TIME.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.125
ACTUALLY...

16:08.166 --> 16:11.500
I THINK THIS WEEK,
I PROBABLY AM AGAIN.

16:13.417 --> 16:17.542
I LIKE YOU, AMELIA.
I DON'T WANT TO DRAG YOU DOWN.

16:17.583 --> 16:22.000
INTO YOUR UNEMPLOYED,
OVERPRIVILEGED MISERY?

16:24.083 --> 16:26.458
I'M A PILLHEAD.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.125
IT'S KIND OF ALL I DO,

16:28.166 --> 16:30.041
AND I KNOW I'M PROBABLY
GONNA HAVE TO

16:30.083 --> 16:31.709
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
SOMEDAY SOON,

16:31.750 --> 16:36.083
BUT THE TRUTH IS, I HAVEN'T
GOT THAT MUCH LEFT TO LOSE.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.625
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.375
YOU'VE WORKED REALLY HARD
FOR THAT.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.417
AND YOU'RE SMART
AND BEAUTIFUL.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.500
AND I LIKE YOU ENOUGH
TO TELL YOU

16:45.542 --> 16:49.667
THAT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO
TO WORK OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

16:50.792 --> 16:53.834
BECAUSE IF YOU LOSE YOUR JOB,

16:53.875 --> 16:56.542
WHO'S GONNA WRITE US REFILLS?

16:58.458 --> 17:00.500
(laughs)

17:02.083 --> 17:04.750
FOUR PAGES OF NOTES
ON ONE SESSION?

17:04.792 --> 17:05.750
REALLY, SHELDON?

17:05.792 --> 17:06.750
FEEDBACK IS AN ESSENTIAL PART

17:06.792 --> 17:08.250
OF RE-IMMERSION
INTO YOUR PRACTICE.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.583
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE TAKING
THIS A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY?

17:09.625 --> 17:11.000
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT
SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.458
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.750
PERSONAL ANECDOTES,
TALKING ABOUT YOUR OWN LIFE--

17:14.792 --> 17:16.417
PATIENTS CAN DO THAT
WITH THEIR FRIENDS,

17:16.458 --> 17:18.041
BUT YOU'RE A THERAPIST.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.375
IT IS EFFECTIVE.
IT ESTABLISHES RAPPORT,

17:20.417 --> 17:23.208
TRUST.
SELF-DISCLOSURE SHOULD ONLY
BE USED AS A LAST RESORT.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.458
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ARE
JUDGING MY METHODOLOGY.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.625
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR EVEN THINKING

17:28.667 --> 17:30.000
OF ASKING YOU TO MONITOR ME.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.667
NO, THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR THINKING I'D BE AN EASY "A."

17:31.709 --> 17:34.125
THERE IS A PROCESS
TO REINSTATEMENT, VIOLET.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.208
I'M FOLLOWING IT.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.041
A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVELY.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.917
HEY, YOU CAME TO ME. I'M NOT
GONNA SUGARCOAT MY OPINION.

17:38.959 --> 17:41.041
FINE. I'M NOT
GONNA SUGARCOAT MINE.

17:42.875 --> 17:46.917
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS, I'M GOING
TO LEAVE THAT OUT OF MY REPORT!

17:46.959 --> 17:48.625

AT THIS. ARE YOU CHEATING?

17:59.625 --> 18:01.041

SINCE, UH, TODAY,
ON THE WAY HOME FROM WORK.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.041
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A STAFF MEETING AT THE HOSPITAL.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.041
CANCELED.

18:15.709 --> 18:17.709

18:17.750 --> 18:19.041
YOU'RE HIS WIFE, RIGHT?

18:19.083 --> 18:20.500
I AM INDEED.

18:20.542 --> 18:22.625

18:22.667 --> 18:24.667

18:46.834 --> 18:50.041

IT'S BEEN SUCH A COOL DAY.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.709

BUT, MOM--

18:56.750 --> 18:58.583
GET YOUR BACKPACK
AND JUST WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE.

19:04.834 --> 19:08.750
(Mason sighs)

19:08.792 --> 19:11.083
I ASK ONE THING--KEEP YOUR WIFE
AWAY FROM MY CHILD.

19:11.125 --> 19:12.750
I DIDN'T KNOW--

19:12.792 --> 19:15.291
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
I CAME HOME EARLY.
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.750
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,
YOU WERE IN MY HOUSE.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.125
NOT ANYMORE.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.041

COME--

19:20.083 --> 19:21.625

THE BAD GUY.

NO.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.333

19:27.083 --> 19:29.375
SHE EVER GONNA LET ME
OFF THE HOOK?

19:31.375 --> 19:34.083

DOESN'T WANT TO BE FOUND.

25:06.959 --> 25:09.125
WE JUST HAVE TO HOPE
SHE COMES TO HER SENSES

25:09.166 --> 25:10.792

HAPPENS.

25:10.834 --> 25:14.166

25:37.083 --> 25:39.333
SHE WAS UP ALL NIGHT
WORKING ON HER CHARTING,

25:39.375 --> 25:40.959

IS NOT HER THING.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.542

DOESN'T SEEM ALL THAT IMPORTANT
IN COMPARISON.

25:56.875 --> 25:58.041
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.667
I'M SURPRISED
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT,

25:59.709 --> 26:01.166
GIVEN YOUR ATTITUDE OF LATE.

26:01.208 --> 26:04.917
SHE'S MY WIFE, SHELDON, AND WE
ARE WORKING THROUGH... A LOT.

26:04.959 --> 26:07.041
I'M ALLOWED
TO BE CRITICAL OF HER,

26:07.083 --> 26:08.625
JUST THE WAY SHE'S ALLOWED
TO BE CRITICAL OF ME.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.000
IT'S A FAIR FIGHT.

26:10.041 --> 26:12.000
IT MIGHT BE A STUPID FIGHT,
BUT IT'S A FAIR ONE.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.375
BUT YOU--YOU ARE JUST USING
THIS POSITION OF AUTHORITY

26:14.417 --> 26:18.250
TO PUSH HER AROUND, AND VIOLET
DESERVES BETTER THAN THAT.

26:18.291 --> 26:19.875
DID VIOLET ASK YOU
TO COME HERE?

26:19.917 --> 26:22.458
NO.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.667
DEFENDING VIOLET
IS A BIG STEP FOR YOU.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.542
IT'S NICE WORK.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.500
(knock on door)

26:32.542 --> 26:35.959
(sighs deeply)

26:36.000 --> 26:37.917
(sighs)

26:37.959 --> 26:39.917
HEY.

26:41.125 --> 26:43.041
I SPIT ON A KID ONCE.

26:43.083 --> 26:45.917
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

26:45.959 --> 26:49.041
THIS LITTLE 6 YEAR OLD SPIT ON
MASON ON THE PLAYGROUND.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.875
HE WAS ONLY 3,
AND SHE WAS A REAL...

26:51.917 --> 26:54.834
SHE WAS A BULLY, AND I SPIT
RIGHT BACK AT HER.

26:54.875 --> 26:57.834
YOU SPIT ON A 6 YEAR OLD?

26:57.875 --> 26:59.834
ONE OF THE WORST THINGS
I'VE EVER DONE.

26:59.875 --> 27:02.875
AND STILL, I DON'T REGRET IT.

27:02.917 --> 27:04.834
I WAS PROTECTING MY SON.

27:04.875 --> 27:08.041
I WAS STANDING UP FOR MY SON.

27:08.083 --> 27:09.709
(sighs)

27:09.750 --> 27:11.875
I THINK MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT YOUR WIFE WAS THINKING

27:11.917 --> 27:16.000
WHEN SHE HANDED ME THAT CHECK
AND ASKED ME TO LEAVE TOWN.

27:16.041 --> 27:19.000
I THINK SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS
STANDING UP FOR YOU.

27:19.041 --> 27:21.000
IT'S MESSED UP.

27:21.041 --> 27:22.917
BUT, UM...

27:25.709 --> 27:27.667
SHE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
A MONSTER.

27:27.709 --> 27:29.417
SHE'S NOT.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.875
OKAY.

27:34.917 --> 27:37.250
CAN I SAY HI TO MASON?

27:37.291 --> 27:38.959
YEAH.

27:40.417 --> 27:42.291
(people speaking indistinctly)

27:42.333 --> 27:44.208
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

27:44.250 --> 27:48.208
UH, EXCUSE ME. I GOT A CALL
ABOUT MY WIFE, SHANNON IVERSON.

27:49.667 --> 27:50.959
(gasps)

27:51.000 --> 27:52.375
I'M DR. BENNETT.

27:52.417 --> 27:55.625
WHAT HAPPENED?

27:55.667 --> 27:57.709
I MEAN, I KNOW ABOUT
THE ACCIDENT, BUT...

27:57.750 --> 28:00.041
SHANNON'S BEING KEPT ALIVE
ON A VENTILATOR,

28:00.083 --> 28:02.041
AND SHE...

28:02.083 --> 28:05.959
I'M AFRAID THERE'S NOT A LOT OF
HOPE FOR A MEANINGFUL RECOVERY.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.417
AND THE BABY?

28:09.458 --> 28:12.583
SHE'S CARRYING A FETUS
THAT'S ABOUT 16 WEEKS OLD,

28:12.625 --> 28:15.041
WHICH MEANS THAT HE CAN'T
SURVIVE OUTSIDE THE WOMB.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.250
AND TO KEEP HIM ALIVE--

28:16.291 --> 28:18.959
IT'S A BOY?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
YES.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.166
I'M SORRY.

28:24.208 --> 28:27.333
SO, UH...

28:27.375 --> 28:29.041
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

28:29.083 --> 28:33.041
WELL, SHANNON SIGNED
AN ORGAN DONOR CARD.

28:33.083 --> 28:36.834
AND WE HAVE A WOMAN HERE
WHO'S A MATCH.

28:36.875 --> 28:38.875
SHE DESPERATELY NEEDS A HEART.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.000
DOUG.
NOW I UNDER--

28:43.375 --> 28:47.041
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
SHE KEPT GOING WITH THE I.V.F.

28:47.083 --> 28:49.375
WELL, SHE--SHE KNEW
HOW HARD IT WAS ON YOU,

28:49.417 --> 28:51.208
AND I THINK SHE WAS
GOING TO TELL YOU

28:51.250 --> 28:53.041
WHEN SHE WAS CERTAIN
IT WOULD WORK.

28:53.083 --> 28:55.417
AND IT DID. DR. BENNETT
TOLD ME ABOUT THE BABY.

28:55.458 --> 28:59.041
I ALSO TOLD HIM THAT THE CHANCES
OF SURVIVAL ARE--ARE REMOTE.

28:59.083 --> 29:00.875
I'M NOT SURE "REMOTE"
IS ACCURATE.

29:00.917 --> 29:03.875
IF WE CAN GET SHANNON
TO 25 OR 26 WEEKS,

29:03.917 --> 29:05.208
THEN, UH...

29:05.250 --> 29:07.709
DR. BENNETT TOLD ME THAT SHANNON
WAS GONNA DONATE HER HEART.

29:07.750 --> 29:10.041
DOUG, HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO GO IN AND--AND SEE SHANNON?

29:10.083 --> 29:12.041
UH, NO. NOT YET.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.875
THERE'S A NEONATOLOGIST
AND A NEUROSURGEON IN THERE

29:13.917 --> 29:15.583
WHO CAN ANSWER
SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS,

29:15.625 --> 29:18.834
AND THEN WE CAN--
WE CAN TALK AGAIN, ALL RIGHT?

29:26.083 --> 29:27.667
(people speaking indistinctly)

29:27.709 --> 29:29.041
WHERE DOES IT END WITH YOU?

29:29.083 --> 29:31.458
I JUST TOLD HIM THAT HIS WIFE
WAS A MATCH FOR LEE ANN.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.083
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF THE SITUATION.

29:33.125 --> 29:35.041
YOU WOULD'VE DONE
THE SAME THING.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.875
I'M ADVOCATING FOR MY PATIENT.

29:36.917 --> 29:38.417
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
YOUR PATIENT AND MINE IS

29:38.458 --> 29:42.000
THAT YOUR PATIENT'S ALREADY DEAD
AND MINE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.917
YOU KNOW THAT
WE CAN HEAR YOU IN THERE.

29:45.959 --> 29:48.041
GOOD. MAYBE AT LEAST YOU'LL GET
BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.041
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING
TO MANIPULATE THE MAN, OKAY?

29:50.083 --> 29:51.500
LEE ANN IS
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

29:51.542 --> 29:53.583
AND THAT BABY NEEDS MORE TIME.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

29:53.625 --> 29:55.000
OKAY, BOTH OF YOU
NEED TO UNDERSTAND

29:55.041 --> 29:57.041
THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO MANIPULATE ME EITHER, OKAY?

29:57.083 --> 29:59.000
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA CHOOSE
BETWEEN YOU.

29:59.041 --> 30:01.041
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE TWO
OF YOU WANT OR WHAT I WANT.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.166
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN ABOUT
WHAT SHANNON WANTED.

30:03.208 --> 30:07.750
NOW IT'S ABOUT DOUG AND WHAT HE
WANTS. THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.375
(objects clinking)

30:15.417 --> 30:16.834
(moans)

30:22.083 --> 30:24.000
HEY, LOOK WHO'S AWAKE.

30:24.041 --> 30:25.125
(man) MM-HMM.

30:25.166 --> 30:27.083
WHO ARE YOU GUYS?

30:27.125 --> 30:29.166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:29.208 --> 30:32.041
WE'RE HERE TO THANK THE LADY
WITH THE 'SCRIPS.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.041
(man chuckles)

30:34.083 --> 30:36.625
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, INVITING
TOTAL STRANGERS IN HERE?

30:36.667 --> 30:38.750
THEY'RE NOT STRANGERS.
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.

30:38.792 --> 30:40.834
WELL,
I DON'T WANT TO THEM HERE.

30:42.834 --> 30:44.208
YOU HEARD HER.

30:44.250 --> 30:45.750
THE PARTY'S OVER.
(man) ARE YOU SERIOUS?

30:45.792 --> 30:46.917
(man) NO.

30:46.959 --> 30:48.375
THE PARTY JUST STARTED, MAN.

30:48.417 --> 30:51.125
THE PARTY'S OVER. GET OUT.

30:51.166 --> 30:54.125
OH, MAN.

30:57.041 --> 31:01.041
(men speaking indistinctly)

31:01.083 --> 31:04.041
(door closes)

31:04.083 --> 31:05.542
THAT WAS MANLY.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.041
I KNOW HOW TO CLEAR A ROOM.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.375
(gulps)

31:08.417 --> 31:11.041
I'M SORRY.
SORRY. I'M JUST--

31:11.083 --> 31:12.291
YOU'RE COMING DOWN.

31:21.166 --> 31:24.208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:24.250 --> 31:26.041
TAKING THE EDGE OFF.

31:26.083 --> 31:27.583
YOU EVER SMOKED IT?

31:27.625 --> 31:29.792
NO.

31:29.834 --> 31:31.000
TRUST ME.

31:34.458 --> 31:36.166
THIS WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIER

31:36.208 --> 31:39.667
THAN YOU EVER IMAGINED.

31:39.709 --> 31:41.667
(inhales)

31:41.709 --> 31:44.083
(gags and coughs)

31:44.125 --> 31:48.000
(exhales deeply)

31:59.834 --> 32:02.792
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:02.834 --> 32:05.792
(ventilator
hissing and clicking)

32:05.834 --> 32:08.959
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

32:09.000 --> 32:10.500
(door closes)

32:16.709 --> 32:19.417
AFTER YOUR HOPES HAVE BEEN...

32:19.458 --> 32:23.041
CRUSHED SO MANY TIMES...

32:24.709 --> 32:27.041
SOMETHING INSIDE YOU DIES.

32:27.083 --> 32:29.959
AT LEAST IT DID WITH ME.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
I COULDN'T HANG ON TO THE DREAM
OF BEING A PARENT ANYMORE.

32:35.959 --> 32:38.458
BUT SHANNON--
SHE NEVER LET IT GO.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.750
MAYBE WE SHOULD KEEP HER ALIVE.

32:44.792 --> 32:46.875
HAVING THIS BABY WAS HER DREAM.

32:46.917 --> 32:49.458
IT WAS.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.041
BUT THE QUESTION NOW IS,

32:52.083 --> 32:53.583
IS IT YOUR DREAM?

32:58.083 --> 33:01.041
HOW DOES IT WORK?

33:01.083 --> 33:04.458
WITH HER AND WITH THE BABY?

33:04.500 --> 33:06.750
WELL, IF WE'RE...

33:06.792 --> 33:08.709
IF WE'RE FORTUNATE,
WE CAN KEEP SHANNON ALIVE

33:08.750 --> 33:10.500
UNTIL THE BABY GETS TO TERM,

33:10.542 --> 33:13.041
BUT THAT'S UNLIKELY.

33:13.083 --> 33:15.041
WHAT'S MORE LIKELY IS

33:15.083 --> 33:18.083
THAT THE BABY WILL BE BORN
PREMATURELY,

33:18.125 --> 33:21.041
MAYBE TRAUMATICALLY SO,

33:21.083 --> 33:24.417
WHICH PUTS HIM AT SERIOUS RISK
FOR CHRONIC LUNG PROBLEMS,

33:24.458 --> 33:27.125
DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES,
BLINDNESS.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.834
I'M TELLING YOU THIS

33:28.875 --> 33:31.625
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'D BE AGREEING TO.

33:31.667 --> 33:35.041
THERE'S A CHANCE THE BABY
WOULD BE FINE, BUT...

33:35.083 --> 33:39.500
THERE'S A GREATER CHANCE
THAT HE AND YOU...

33:39.542 --> 33:41.667
WOULD HAVE
SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES.

33:44.667 --> 33:47.834
AND KNOWING ALL OF THIS,

33:47.875 --> 33:50.375
IF HAVING THIS BABY

33:50.417 --> 33:53.792
IS STILL YOUR DREAM...

33:53.834 --> 33:56.333
THEN I WILL STOP ANY DOCTOR
COMING THROUGH THAT DOOR

33:56.375 --> 33:58.959
WHO WANTS TO PULL THE PLUG.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.333
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS...

34:04.083 --> 34:06.667
SHANNON WOULD HAVE BEEN
AN AMAZING MUM.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.458
SHE CAN STILL DO
SOMETHING AMAZING.

34:15.041 --> 34:16.041
EITHER WAY...

34:16.083 --> 34:18.041
(sighs deeply)

34:18.083 --> 34:19.834
IT'S UP TO YOU.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.375
(sighs)

34:22.417 --> 34:25.375
(beeping continues)

34:25.417 --> 34:28.417
(hissing and clicking continue)

34:31.709 --> 34:35.041
SO I FINISHED ALL THESE FILES,

34:35.083 --> 34:36.625
AND Y--

34:36.667 --> 34:38.000
YOU OKAY?

34:40.083 --> 34:42.041
I'VE CALLED EVERYONE
AND EVERYWHERE I CAN THINK OF,

34:42.083 --> 34:44.250
BUT THERE'S NO AMELIA.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.417
I LEFT HER SO MANY MESSAGES

34:46.458 --> 34:49.041
THAT HER MAILBOX IS FULL.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.375
(cell phone thuds)

34:50.417 --> 34:51.625
I'M SORRY.

34:51.667 --> 34:54.041
J--I'M JUST--

34:54.083 --> 34:56.041
I'M--I'M SORRY.

34:57.709 --> 35:00.834
I MAY HAVE BEEN A BIT HARD
ON YOU ABOUT YOUR CASEWORK.

35:00.875 --> 35:03.709
AND YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED I AM
ABOUT AMELIA.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.875
AND... (sighs)

35:05.917 --> 35:08.041
THE TRUTH IS, I WAS ANNOYED

35:08.083 --> 35:12.500
ABOUT HOW YOU MICROMANAGED
MY OVERSEEING OF YOUR PATIENTS

35:12.542 --> 35:14.041
WHILE YOU WERE ON SUSPENSION,

35:14.083 --> 35:17.417
AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I WAS
USING THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS

35:17.458 --> 35:20.834
TO--TO BE PETTY AND VENGEFUL,

35:20.875 --> 35:22.250
WHICH, IF TRUE,

35:22.291 --> 35:24.542
WOULD BE WRONG.

35:24.583 --> 35:28.166
AND YOU JUST CAME TO THIS
REALIZATION ALL BY YOURSELF?

35:28.208 --> 35:31.166
AS A FELLOW THERAPIST,
I THINK YOU CAN APPRECIATE

35:31.208 --> 35:33.166
THAT SOMETIMES
OUR MOST IMPORTANT INSIGHTS

35:33.208 --> 35:38.000
ABOUT OURSELVES CAN COME
FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

35:38.041 --> 35:42.041
ANYWAY, I SENT IN MY REPORT
TO THE MEDICAL BOARD.

35:42.083 --> 35:44.291
OH, YEAH?
AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

35:44.333 --> 35:46.166
THAT YOU'RE
AN EXCELLENT THERAPIST

35:46.208 --> 35:50.000
AND YOU DESERVE
TO BE BACK AT WORK.

35:53.041 --> 35:55.125
(indistinct conversations)

35:55.166 --> 35:58.959
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
(people speaking indistinctly)

36:11.083 --> 36:13.166
LET HER GO.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.125
(man) OKAY.

36:27.083 --> 36:30.083
(medical team
speaking indistinctly)

36:30.125 --> 36:32.041
(door closes)

36:43.875 --> 36:45.458
ARE YOU OKAY?

36:45.500 --> 36:46.792
FINE.

36:46.834 --> 36:49.041
WHY AM I NOT CONVINCED?

36:49.083 --> 36:52.583
I'M JUST GETTING
EVERYTHING IN ORDER.

36:52.625 --> 36:55.041
ALL RIGHT,
BEFORE YOU DO THIS,

36:55.083 --> 36:57.875
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH SHANNON.

36:57.917 --> 36:59.166
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

36:59.208 --> 37:01.083
IT'S NOT LIKE I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA MISS.

37:01.125 --> 37:05.041
IT'S JUST--
IT WOULD BE NICE...

37:05.083 --> 37:07.041
I JUST WANT SOME GOOD JUJU
IN HERE.

37:07.083 --> 37:11.083
(exhales deeply)

37:13.083 --> 37:14.750
ALL RIGHT.

37:22.083 --> 37:24.875
SHANNON'S LUNGS WENT TO
A YOUNG DAD WHO GOT CANCER

37:24.917 --> 37:26.500
EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER SMOKED.

37:26.542 --> 37:29.041
HER LIVER'S BEING PARTITIONED
BETWEEN A WOMAN HERE

37:29.083 --> 37:31.041
AND A SOLDIER IN FRESNO.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.250
I GET IT. IT...

37:33.291 --> 37:35.291
THAT'S ALL GOOD NEWS,
BUT, UH...

37:35.333 --> 37:37.250
IT STILL ISN'T EASY.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.709
I KNOW.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.041
IT USED TO BE EASIER,

37:41.083 --> 37:42.500
FOR ME, ANYWAY, YOU KNOW,

37:42.542 --> 37:44.208
IT WAS SAVE THE MOM.

37:44.250 --> 37:47.250
YOU JUST... SAVE THE MOM.

37:47.291 --> 37:51.208
AND NOW
WHEN I THINK ABOUT BABIES,

37:51.250 --> 37:55.500
IT'S NOT CLEAR
OR EASY ANYMORE.

37:55.542 --> 37:59.208
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S BETTER OR WORSE.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.083
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

38:01.125 --> 38:03.041
WHAT WE DO--IT'S...

38:03.083 --> 38:04.875
IT'S PERSONAL.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.041
IT CAN'T BE ANYTHING ELSE.

38:06.083 --> 38:09.041
SO LONG
AS IT DOESN'T CARRY OVER.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.667
LOOK, SAM FOUGHT.

38:11.709 --> 38:13.125
I FOUGHT.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.542
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

38:15.583 --> 38:17.291
DOUG HAD
ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

38:17.333 --> 38:21.250
IT WAS...
IT WAS HIS CALL TO MAKE.

38:21.291 --> 38:23.583
SO YES...

38:23.625 --> 38:25.000
IT WON'T CARRY OVER.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.583
OKAY.

38:29.625 --> 38:32.125
LOOK, DON'T WORRY.

38:32.166 --> 38:34.208

whistle blows)

38:54.375 --> 38:56.959
HE DOESN'T USUALLY DO THAT.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.750
OR AT LEAST
IT TAKES HIM LONGER.

39:03.083 --> 39:04.583
