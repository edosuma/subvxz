AS THIS ESTABLISHMENT, BOY.

16:59.686 --> 17:04.257
LADIES! THIS IS ME COUSIN,
"DANDY" JOHNNY SHEA,

17:04.291 --> 17:06.793
AND THIS PACK OF RARE BULGARIANS
ARE THE DEAD RABBITS.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.528
WELCOME, LADS.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.231
WELCOME.
TELL YOU WHAT.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.434
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THEM UPSTAIRS

17:14.467 --> 17:16.536
AND WELCOME THEM
TO CHEYENNE PROPERLY.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.705
- LET'S GO.
- YES, SIR.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.775
- GO ON, GET UP.
I'LL SPEAK TO ME COUSIN.

17:22.809 --> 17:23.843
HELL YEAH.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.678
SO, UH, MICHAEL.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.116
REMIND ME NOW WHY I LEFT ME DAN
AND WIFE IN THE FIVE POINTS

17:29.149 --> 17:31.118
TO COME OUT TO THIS...

17:31.118 --> 17:32.819
ROTTEN STINK HOLE.

17:32.852 --> 17:37.124
- WE'RE GONNA EXTORT
SOME PEOPLE, BASH SOME HEADS,

17:37.124 --> 17:38.225
AND STRONG-ARM THE GOVERNOR.

17:38.258 --> 17:43.296
- JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.165
IT'S GRAND TO SEE YA, MICHAEL.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.200
- IT'S GREAT TO SEE YA, BOYO.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.640
- TELL ME HE AIN'T GONNA DIE.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.808
- I'VE STEMMED THE BLEEDING.

17:55.842 --> 17:56.843
HE'S STABLE.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.782
- I GAVE YOU A CHANCE,
SENORITA.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.152
YOU 'MEMBER THAT.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.686
- DROP THE GUN, SID.

18:06.719 --> 18:11.291
- ADIOS, BOHANNON.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.793
- YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.498
HERE, GET HIM UP.
- OH--

18:26.739 --> 18:28.308
- THE ARTERY'S SHREDDED.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.777
I CAN'T FIX THAT
AND I CAN'T STOP THE BLEEDING.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.312
- YOU AIN'T GONNA
LET ME DIE, DOC.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.214
WE COME TOO FAR NOW.

18:34.247 --> 18:38.251
- THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO BE DONE, IT'S OVER.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.920
- SHIT!

18:40.953 --> 18:43.490
ALL RIGHT, SAW IT OFF.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.193
RIGHT ABOVE THE WOUND
AND SEW IT THERE.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.527
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.363
- HELL NO,
YOU AIN'T GONNA TAKE MY LEG OFF!

18:50.397 --> 18:51.898
- CAN'T LET YOU DIE, SID.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.434
LEG'S COMING OFF.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.437
- BOHANNON!

19:05.712 --> 19:08.915
- NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING CRUEL,
BOHANNON, LET HIM DIE.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.918
- HE DOES, CAMPBELL HANGS RUTH.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.221
- DON'T BE ABSURD.
HE CAN'T HANG A WOMAN.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.788
- IT'S BEEN DONE.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.824
- THERE'S NOT A JURY IN THE LAND
WHO'LL CONVICT HER.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.260
- YEAH, WELL, I
AIN'T TAKING THAT CHANCE.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.728
GOT AN AMPUTATION BLADE?

19:21.761 --> 19:22.929
- NO.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.398
AND I HAVE NEVER
AMPUTATED A LEG, EITHER.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.933
- I'LL GET YOU THROUGH IT.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.968
- YOU BEST BE
BUILDING A BIRDHOUSE.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.803
- YOU WANT TO DIE?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.805
- IF I DO,
IT'S GONNA BE WITH TWO LEGS ON.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.775
- WELL, YOU LOST THAT CHOICE
WHEN YOU THREW THEM LANTERNS.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.281
HOLD HIM DOWN.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.949
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
NO, NO, NO, HEY!

19:42.982 --> 19:45.385
YOU COME ANYWHERE NEAR ME
WITH THAT KNIFE, I SWEAR IT GOD,

19:45.418 --> 19:48.821
IT'S GONNA BE THE LAST THING
YOU DO!

19:48.855 --> 19:50.423
AH! NO! NO, NO!

19:50.457 --> 19:52.359
LOOK! HEY, BOHANNON! BOHANNON!

19:52.392 --> 19:54.261
LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! JUST
LET IT LOOSE AND LET ME GO!

19:54.294 --> 19:55.795
JUST PUT ME ON A HORSE!

19:55.828 --> 19:57.397
PUT ME ON A HORSE AND I-I'LL GO!
I DON'T NEVER COME BACK!

19:57.430 --> 19:58.698
YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA SEE
ME AGAIN!

19:58.731 --> 19:59.766
COME ON! COME ON!

19:59.799 --> 20:01.501
LOOK! JUST DON'T TAKE MY LEG!

20:01.534 --> 20:03.270
JUST PUT ME ON A HORSE, I'LL GO,
I'LL NEVER COME BACK,

20:03.303 --> 20:06.373
YOU NEVER GONNA SEE ME AGAIN,
I SWEAR TO GOD!

20:06.406 --> 20:07.374
DON'T TAKE MY LEG!

20:07.407 --> 20:10.710
[groaning and choking]

20:14.347 --> 20:15.448
[screams]

20:16.783 --> 20:18.385
- I TAKE NO PLEASURE

20:18.418 --> 20:22.989
IN THE PROSPECT OF SENDING
THE CHURCH LADY TO THE GALLOWS.

20:23.022 --> 20:26.959
BUT IF THAT IS THE TASK
LAID BEFORE US,

20:26.993 --> 20:28.795
BE SWIFT ABOUT IT.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.265
- YOUR FRIEND, MISS ELLISON,
WILL NEED TO BE MANAGED.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.566
SHE'S WIDELY READ

20:33.600 --> 20:36.836
AND HAS BEEN CRITICAL
OF OUR POLICIES HERE.

20:38.505 --> 20:43.376
- THE RULE OF THE LAW
APPLIES TO EVERYONE, JUDGE.

20:43.410 --> 20:47.280
TASK OF ENFORCING IT
IS AN UNPLEASANT BURDEN.

20:47.314 --> 20:50.283
I'M NOT ENTIRELY UNSYMPATHETIC.

20:50.317 --> 20:53.420
COUCHED IN THE RIGHT LANGUAGE.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.655
I'LL HANDLE MISS ELLISON.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.928
- CAMPBELL!

21:01.961 --> 21:05.798
YOU'LL GIVE ME YOUR EARS BEFORE
YOU BEND THEM ELBOWS AGAIN.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.968
THIS IS HERE "DANDY"
JOHNNY SHEA.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.470
HE'S A HARD MAN.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.772
A BRUISER.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.407
AND A COUSIN
ON ME MOTHER'S SIDE.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.476
AND FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,

21:16.509 --> 21:20.046
HE IS THE NEW PROPRIETOR
OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT

21:20.079 --> 21:23.850
AND ANY MAN WHO TAKES ISSUE
WITH THAT

21:23.883 --> 21:26.085
CAN TAKE IT UP WITH MESELF,

21:26.118 --> 21:28.555
CAN TAKE IT UP WITH JOHNNY,

21:28.588 --> 21:31.358
OR WITH ONE
OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS HERE.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.993
- IS THIS THE COWARD WHO BEAT YA
WHEN YOUR HANDS WERE TIED,

21:34.026 --> 21:34.994
MICHAEL?

21:35.027 --> 21:36.663
- IT IS.

21:36.696 --> 21:40.800
- YOU WANT TO, UH,
YOU WANT TO DANCE WITH ME, BOYO?

21:51.411 --> 21:55.615
- HE CAN'T SAVE YOU NOW.

21:55.648 --> 21:59.652
- CASINO IS YOURS,
MR. MCGINNES.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.921
- UGH!

22:01.954 --> 22:03.956
AHH!

22:03.990 --> 22:07.059
- MR. MCGINNES,
WE CONCEDED THE CASINO.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.961
- JOHNNY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.430
- AHH!

22:10.463 --> 22:13.466
- I'LL SCOOP THE SHITE
CLEAN OUT OF YOUR SKULL!

22:13.500 --> 22:16.869
- MR. MCGINNES,
CONTROL YOUR MAN!

22:16.903 --> 22:18.070
- AHH!
- JOHNNY!

22:18.104 --> 22:19.439
I SAID STOP, LET GO OF HIM.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.073
- I HEARD YA, MICK!

22:21.107 --> 22:22.575
THING IS, I LOVE YA,

22:22.609 --> 22:24.611
BUT I DON'T WORK FOR YA!

22:24.644 --> 22:30.750
- [screaming]

22:33.686 --> 22:38.558
- A MADMAN.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.428
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALLED
MY FATHER.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.896
- WHO?
THE NEWSPAPERS?

22:43.930 --> 22:47.500
- I USED TO HATE REPORTERS.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.135
- I STILL DO...

22:49.168 --> 22:51.438
SOMETIMES.

22:55.942 --> 23:01.047
- WHEN HE LEFT HOME TO SPEAK FOR
THE INDIANS ONCE AND FOR GOOD,

23:03.516 --> 23:06.686
I READ EVERY ARTICLE
ON HIS EXPLOITS.

23:10.957 --> 23:16.529
AND THEY CALLED HIM A MARTYR.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.065
I'M NOT A MARTYR.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.036
- HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF?

23:28.941 --> 23:32.011
- I'M A MOTHER.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.521
- THIS IS GOING
TO HURT LIKE HELL.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.523
- NO NO NO NO! NO! WAIT WAIT
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!

23:43.556 --> 23:45.157
AHH!

23:45.191 --> 23:49.929
[screaming]

24:02.208 --> 24:06.679
[muffled talking]

24:06.713 --> 24:08.681
- NOW, BOHANNON.

24:22.595 --> 24:27.233
- COME ON, MAN.
- HOLD STILL.

24:27.266 --> 24:30.970
IT'LL GO FASTER.

24:31.003 --> 24:35.207
- DON'T CUT IT OFF.

24:35.241 --> 24:38.545
[groaning]

25:02.034 --> 25:05.705
[thunder rumbles]

25:19.218 --> 25:22.121
- MY CONDOLENCES, MISS RUTH.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.090
OVER EZRA PASSING.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.758
- THANK YOU, PSALMS.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.026
- WHAT YOU NEED?

25:27.059 --> 25:29.095
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.329
- NO, I NEED TO PASS.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.599
- I-I'M HERE TO SEE
YOU STAY PUT.

25:32.632 --> 25:37.103
MR. BOHANNON'S ORDERS.

25:37.136 --> 25:42.875
- WELL, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MR. SNOW?

25:42.909 --> 25:47.179
- I HEAR MR. BOHANNON DOING
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO SAVE HIM.

25:47.213 --> 25:51.818
- SAVE HIM?

25:51.851 --> 25:53.319
WHY?

25:53.352 --> 25:58.224
- TO SAVE YOU, MISS RUTH.

25:58.257 --> 26:03.129
I THINK IT'S BEST
YOU GO BACK INSIDE, NOW.

26:20.179 --> 26:24.751
- IF I'M EVER ON THAT TABLE,
WANT YOU THERE.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.886
- IF YOU'RE EVER ON THAT TABLE,

26:26.919 --> 26:30.657
I HOPE I'M
THE ONE PUTS YOU THERE.

26:34.727 --> 26:37.229
- IT WASN'T ELAM IN THAT
BOX.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.198
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.801
- ELAM WANTED ME.

26:41.834 --> 26:45.404
HE WOULD HAVE
LEFT QUIET WITH ME.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.139
AND YOU TOOK THAT FROM US.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.808
- EVA...

26:48.841 --> 26:49.742
IT WAS FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.211
- NO ONE ASKED YOU FOR IT.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.394
- CONGRATULATIONS.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.763
YOU AIN'T DEAD.

27:19.171 --> 27:22.174
- ALL THIS TO SEE ME HANG?

27:22.208 --> 27:23.710
- NOPE.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.278
FIRST YOU GONNA
SAVE THE CHURCH LADY.

27:26.312 --> 27:30.416
- ONE GOOD ACT AIN'T GONNA WASH
AWAY ALL THE BAD I'VE DONE.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.853
WHAT BECOMES OF MEN LIKE US,
BOHANNON?

27:33.886 --> 27:36.255
WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE WE END UP?

27:42.795 --> 27:44.964
- NOWHERES GOOD.

27:52.071 --> 27:55.007
- THAT BASTARD GONNA LIVE?

27:55.041 --> 27:56.943
- EH,

27:56.976 --> 27:59.078
TOOK OFF HIS DAMN LEG.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.781
- HE GONNA BE MEANER
THAN BEFORE.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.215
- NOT FOR MUCH LONGER.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.858
- YOU POSTED A GUARD.

28:17.797 --> 28:22.468
- WE TOOK THE LEG OFF.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.872
HE'LL LIVE.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.841
HE WILL ANSWER FOR EZRA, RUTH.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.778
- BUT WILL I ANSWER FOR HIM?

28:31.778 --> 28:33.846
- YOU'LL BE FREE.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.848
WE'LL REBUILD YOUR CHURCH.

28:41.353 --> 28:44.423
- YOU CAN'T REBUILT WHAT I LOST.

29:02.108 --> 29:06.012
- YOU'RE A BETTER SURGEON
THAN I WAS A FARMER.

29:06.045 --> 29:09.315
- WELL, FROM WHAT LITTLE I KNOW
OF YOU, THAT'S NOT SAYING A LOT.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.917
[chuckles]

29:16.856 --> 29:18.991
I WANTED TO BE AN EYE DOCTOR.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.526
STUDIED OPHTHALMOLOGY.

29:20.559 --> 29:23.529
BUT I NEVER
FINISHED MEDICAL SCHOOL.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.899
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

29:26.933 --> 29:29.535
'DOC' IS AN AFFECTATION A--

29:29.568 --> 29:31.070
AN HONORIFIC TITLE

29:31.103 --> 29:34.440
I ADOPTED TO HELP ME
IN THE BUSINESS OF RAILROADING.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.008
[laughs]
- YOU'RE SHITTING ME.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.477
- I AM NOT.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.347
- DAMN.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.487
WHAT YOU THINK IS GONNA...

29:48.520 --> 29:51.490
HAPPEN TO MEN LIKE US?

29:51.523 --> 29:52.959
AFTER SHE'S BUILT.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.894
- WELL, I WILL BE REMEMBERED

29:54.927 --> 29:57.096
AS THE MAN WHO BUILT
THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.998
YOU WILL NOT BE
REMEMBERED AT ALL.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.333
NOT EVEN BY ME.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.568
- THANKS FOR SUGARCOATING IT.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.937
- [laughs]
IT'S THE TRUTH.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.439
YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH,
YOU'LL SEE I WAS RIGHT.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.978
- YEP.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.081
MM.

30:23.355 --> 30:26.192
- [groaning]

30:28.627 --> 30:33.532
I THOUGHT I'D SEE THE WORLD
ONE LAST TIME BEFORE I DIED.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.968
- WON'T GET FAR.

30:37.569 --> 30:43.876
GOD.

30:43.910 --> 30:47.613
- I SAW THIS UNION BOY ONCE
CRAWL A HALF-MILE.

30:47.646 --> 30:51.884
NOTHING FROM THE WAIST DOWN.

30:51.918 --> 30:57.389
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE THAN 17.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.558
IT'S A HELL OF A SIGHT TO SEE.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.931
A MAN WITH NO LEGS,
PULLING HIMSELF ALONG.

31:06.565 --> 31:10.502
I CHASED HIM...

31:10.536 --> 31:14.073
'TIL HE COULDN'T GO NO MORE
AND I PINNED HIM WITH MY FOOT.

31:14.106 --> 31:18.477
SAID, "WHAT'S YOUR HURRY, BOY?"

31:18.510 --> 31:20.079
HE STARTED LOOKING THROUGH
HIS JACKET RIGHT ABOUT THEN,

31:20.112 --> 31:23.649
FOR A PHOTOGRAPH.

31:23.682 --> 31:28.554
SEE, HE WANTED TO SEE
HIS MOMMA ONE LAST TIME,

31:28.587 --> 31:30.990
BEFORE HE DIED.

31:32.324 --> 31:35.527
I REMEMBER HE DUG
ALL THROUGH THAT COAT.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.164
HE LOOKED REAL HARD.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.000
KEPT BEGGING ME
TO HELP HIM FIND IT.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.340
I SAID, "WELL, HELL, BOY.

31:48.374 --> 31:51.510
THAT PICTURE'S PROBABLY
IN YOUR PANTS POCKET."

31:57.016 --> 31:59.151
I HAD A GOOD LAUGH.

32:06.025 --> 32:09.195
WE ALL GOT MOMENTS.

32:09.228 --> 32:12.164
EVERY MAN I EVER
KILLED GOT ONE SOMEPLACE.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.007
- DAMN, SID!

32:21.040 --> 32:23.442
- I NEED TO TELL
THAT CHURCH LADY...

32:23.475 --> 32:25.044
I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT HER BOY.

32:25.077 --> 32:27.213
- SHUT UP!
[groans]

32:33.285 --> 32:38.657
- I KNOW IT HAPPENS TO MEN
LIKE US, BOHANNON.

32:38.690 --> 32:42.194
WE END UP FAR FROM HOME...

32:42.228 --> 32:45.731
COVERED IN BLOOD...

32:45.764 --> 32:50.736
AND SHIT.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.504
WE DIE ALONE.

32:52.538 --> 32:55.207
- I SAID SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH.

32:55.241 --> 32:57.476
- "SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTH."

32:57.509 --> 32:59.745
THAT'S FUNNY.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.056
- SID?

34:15.321 --> 34:18.590
- THIS PLEASES ME MUCH.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.626
THERE'S A--IT IS A BLESSING TO
HAVE--

34:20.659 --> 34:25.431
TO HAVE A CHILD
WHO CHERISHES GOD'S WORD.

34:31.137 --> 34:33.205
YOU ARE MY GOOD--

34:33.239 --> 34:36.808
GOOD AND BELOVED DAUGHTER.

34:39.778 --> 34:44.250
- "THOU SHALT NOT KILL."

34:44.283 --> 34:48.320
- THOSE MEN LAST NIGHT...

34:48.354 --> 34:52.791
GOD SENT ME TO THEM TO, UH--
TO AVENGE THEIR SINS.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.800
- "'VENGEANCE IS MINE.

35:01.833 --> 35:06.338
I WILL REPAY,' SAITH THE LORD."

35:06.372 --> 35:08.574
- YEAH.
PAUL TO THE ROMANS.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.677
SATAN HIMSELF DOES SOMETIMES
QUOTE SCRIPTURE.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.745
IT'S ONE OF HIS FOULEST TRICKS.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.647
- "AVENGE NOT YOURSELVES,

35:15.681 --> 35:17.849
BUT RATHER GIVE PLACE
UNTO WRATH."

35:17.883 --> 35:19.885
- ENOUGH!

35:21.787 --> 35:23.189
[laughs]

35:27.926 --> 35:31.263
- WHAT DOES IT MEAN, PAPA?

35:31.297 --> 35:32.798
- WHEN YOU'RE OLDER THE--

35:32.831 --> 35:35.634
THE TRUE MEANINGS
WILL STAND REVEALED.

35:35.667 --> 35:39.771
THAT IS WHY THE LORD
PUTS OUR ELDERS ABOVE US.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.428
- RUTH?

36:04.430 --> 36:08.234
- GOD DOESN'T AVENGE SINS
THROUGH HIS CREATIONS.

36:11.803 --> 36:16.708
HE DOESN'T MOVE MEN TO KILL.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.744
- I'VE MET PLENTY OF MEN
WHO WOULD

36:18.777 --> 36:20.779
HAVE YOU BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY.

36:27.353 --> 36:31.290
- YOU DON'T RELY ON GOD...

36:31.323 --> 36:33.259
DO YOU, MISS ELLISON?

36:38.897 --> 36:40.466
- NO.

36:40.499 --> 36:43.402
- WHY?

36:43.435 --> 36:48.974
- I'VE SEEN FAR TOO MUCH
OF WHAT MEN DO IN HIS NAME...

36:49.007 --> 36:52.278
TO BELIEVE THAT HE
WOULD EVER BE THERE FOR ME.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.474
- MISS ELLISON.

37:33.519 --> 37:36.021
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

37:36.054 --> 37:38.924
- ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO PROSECUTE RUTH COLE?

37:38.957 --> 37:43.562
- THE WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE
WITHOUT MEN LIKE SIDNEY SNOW,

37:43.595 --> 37:47.933
AND BETTER WITH WOMEN OF HIGH
MORAL STANDARDS LIKE MISS COLE.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.802
AND YOURSELF.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.839
- JOHN, THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.374
THAT'S A PUBLIC POSITION.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.376
- I'M NOT A FOOL, LOUISE,

37:57.409 --> 38:00.412
BUT I AM THE GOVERNOR
AND ALL THAT IMPLIES.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.513
- CAN I QUOTE YOU ON THAT?

38:01.547 --> 38:04.383
- NO, YOU CANNOT.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.818
IN FACT...

38:06.852 --> 38:10.622
I WOULD SUGGEST
THAT UNTIL THIS MATTER RESOLVES,

38:10.656 --> 38:14.393
YOU KEEP IT
OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER.

38:14.426 --> 38:17.062
- IS THAT A REQUEST...

38:17.095 --> 38:18.997
OR A THREAT?

38:19.030 --> 38:22.000
- PUBLIC HYSTERIA WILL NOT HELP
MISS COLE'S CAUSE.

38:22.033 --> 38:23.969
- NOR YOURS.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.639
HMM.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.430
- HE'S BETTER OFF.

38:51.463 --> 38:56.568
A MAN LIKE THAT--

38:56.602 --> 39:00.439
MEN LIKE US...

39:00.472 --> 39:02.408
WE STILL GOT A JOB TO DO.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.747
YOU KNOW WHAT YOURS IS.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.123
- I'LL BRING THE MUCK WAGON
AROUND.

39:18.156 --> 39:22.093
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.563
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

39:48.153 --> 39:51.156
- HE'S DEAD, ISN'T HE?

- I'M SORRY, RUTH.

41:35.627 --> 41:38.063
- IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

41:41.299 --> 41:44.269
OR GOD'S WILL.

41:44.302 --> 41:47.573
- I'LL FIGURE A WAY OUT.

41:47.573 --> 41:53.144
- I'M FINE, MR. BOHANNON.

41:53.178 --> 41:59.017
THE ONLY THING MORE SATISFYING
THAN SHOOTING MR. SNOW,

41:59.050 --> 42:02.688
WAS THE MOMENT
YOU TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD.
