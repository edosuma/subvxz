I don't understand.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.152
Is there something bigger
behind the scenes here

03:10.232 --> 03:11.654
we should know about, or...

03:13.402 --> 03:16.656

03:37.676 --> 03:39.553
Mr. Price, if I may...

03:40.929 --> 03:44.308

on Allsafe

03:44.391 --> 03:46.485

03:46.727 --> 03:48.570

then Whiterose
had to greenlight it.

of my visit...

I felt it was important
to share with you formally

24:40.354 --> 24:44.575
that the CTO title
is nothing more than that.

Border security

You've always asked
that I be honest with you.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.459
Speak.

43:04.332 --> 43:05.754
This is your fault.

43:09.212 --> 43:12.807
You blindly indulge all
of Elliot Alderson's whims.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.972
And it has landed us here.

43:15.301 --> 43:16.848
If you'd listened to me,

43:17.845 --> 43:21.395
if you believed in my strategy
as much as you did his,

43:21.682 --> 43:23.400
we could have avoided this.

43:24.018 --> 43:27.192

You only get their attention
with force and a lot of it.

with these men.

argument.

Mr. Alderson is claiming

You say that I was wrong
to order the attack.

47:11.704 --> 47:13.752
Maybe I'm wrong
about him as well.

he died for us, too.
