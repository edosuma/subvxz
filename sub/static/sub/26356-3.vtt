This programme contains
some strong language

00:12.197 --> 00:14.876
And after I leave the car, you count.

00:14.877 --> 00:17.157
I count to 60,
and then I come into the shop.

00:19.037 --> 00:20.700
Why are you coming into the shop?

00:21.357 --> 00:22.877
I forgot something.

00:25.957 --> 00:27.517
Do you shut the car door?

00:32.717 --> 00:35.157
Yes. I shut it.

01:45.198 --> 01:46.398
Hey, there!

01:47.878 --> 01:51.117
Hey, can you tell mum, Nanna,
that we're a couple of hours away?

01:51.118 --> 01:53.518
I'll call her when we get to the cottage.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.038
I'm really looking forward to seeing you.

01:59.398 --> 02:01.517
We just saw a far bit of smoke here.

02:01.518 --> 02:03.198
Is there any there?

02:06.032 --> 02:08.390
Well, look, we're going to have a
rest when we get to the cottage,

02:08.416 --> 02:10.377
and maybe get something to eat

02:12.478 --> 02:13.540
It's fabulous.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.591
Yes. It's fabulous, you told me.
He can't wait to see you too.

02:27.284 --> 02:28.420
OK.

02:29.278 --> 02:30.838
I'll see you soon.

02:32.478 --> 02:34.518
Love you, bye.

02:35.878 --> 02:38.798
Hey, sleepy head. Come on.

02:44.158 --> 02:47.198
Noah? Noah?

02:49.638 --> 02:52.500
Noah? Noah?

02:55.958 --> 02:56.998
Jo?

03:01.278 --> 03:02.358
What's wrong?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.757
- What's wrong?
- He's...

03:06.758 --> 03:08.197
He's cold!

03:08.198 --> 03:10.358
- Is he breathing?
- I don't know!

03:13.118 --> 03:14.997
There's no pulse.
When did he stop breathing?

03:14.998 --> 03:16.277
I don't know! I don't know.

03:16.278 --> 03:18.677
- How long's he being like this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

03:18.678 --> 03:19.845
What happened, you just
checked him just then?

03:19.846 --> 03:21.665
Yes! I just checked him,
I just opened the door,

03:21.666 --> 03:24.717
I checked him, and he's cold.
He feels really...

03:24.718 --> 03:26.237
He's not... He's not breathing..

03:26.238 --> 03:28.038
Jo!

03:42.238 --> 03:43.740
Jo.

03:47.838 --> 03:50.798
- Give him to me.
- No.

03:52.518 --> 03:54.358
Please. Please.

04:59.638 --> 05:02.037
Jo!

05:02.038 --> 05:03.078
Jo!

05:04.878 --> 05:06.500
Get in the car.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.580
We'll go for help.

05:24.038 --> 05:25.718
Did you buckle him in?

05:26.711 --> 05:27.791
What?

05:27.816 --> 05:31.055
Did you buckle him in?
He has to be buckled in.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.660
You had to buckle him in.

06:36.878 --> 06:39.438
Alexandra's been arrested
for kidnapping Noah.

06:40.798 --> 06:43.557
We conducted a search,
and found something of Noah's

06:43.558 --> 06:45.020
at your mum's house.

06:46.798 --> 06:49.477
No, no, no, no, no.

06:49.478 --> 06:50.798
What?

06:51.918 --> 06:54.637
Chloe, I understand
how upsetting this is,

06:54.638 --> 06:57.318
but we're going to have to
ask you some questions now.

06:58.238 --> 06:59.758
All this was my fault.

07:03.078 --> 07:04.598
- No, no, no...
- No, Dad...

07:06.013 --> 07:08.133
...I took something out of Joanna's bag.

07:08.158 --> 07:10.580
I had her bag, and I just took it.

07:22.438 --> 07:23.878
Dad!

07:25.158 --> 07:26.917
Thanks, Chloe.

07:26.918 --> 07:28.318
There you go.

07:30.678 --> 07:31.918
It wasn't Mum.

07:34.638 --> 07:37.317
What did it look like, Chloe?

07:37.318 --> 07:40.580
It was blue, it had little white stripes.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.300
Will you let her go?

07:45.158 --> 07:46.638
It was my fault.

07:47.798 --> 07:49.078
I'm sorry.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.077
Shame on you.

07:55.078 --> 07:59.997
Noah's out there somewhere,
and you waste this precious time

07:59.998 --> 08:03.597
trying to frame a single mother,
a jilted ex who occasionally likes

08:03.598 --> 08:08.260
a glass of wine, who runs every day
to stay strong for her kid.

08:10.718 --> 08:13.197
You could jail half the woman in
this town under 40

08:13.198 --> 08:14.597
if that were a crime.

08:14.598 --> 08:16.317
Alex, I know this hasn't
been easy on you.

08:16.318 --> 08:18.637
But we're doing everything

08:18.638 --> 08:20.418
that we can to find out
what happened to Noah.

08:20.419 --> 08:24.677
Everyone in this town now looks at
me like a child-killer, Peter.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.038
You know what they're like.

08:32.198 --> 08:33.154
Thanks.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.059
- See you later, Dad.
- See you soon.

08:36.798 --> 08:41.539
Hey, I'm sorry you
had to go through that.

08:43.278 --> 08:45.060
I never thought you'd hurt him, Alex.

08:45.838 --> 08:47.518
Well, thank you.

08:49.878 --> 08:52.220
Alistair, you're the world's best liar.

08:53.518 --> 08:55.118
You always have been.

09:09.038 --> 09:12.197
What happened?

09:12.198 --> 09:14.037
Tell me what happened.

09:14.038 --> 09:16.637
I, erm, I just...

09:16.638 --> 09:19.540
I reached in for him, and...

09:23.078 --> 09:24.438
He...

09:25.598 --> 09:27.660
He wasn't cold. He was just...

09:30.438 --> 09:31.957
He was just still.

09:31.958 --> 09:32.998
When? When...?

09:34.278 --> 09:35.908
When was he...? when was he last awake?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.056
I don't know. In the plane?

09:37.081 --> 09:38.437
When we got off the plane?

09:38.438 --> 09:40.717
- When was he last awake?
- I don't know! He was...

09:40.718 --> 09:45.077
He cried for the whole flight.
I think he was just tired.

09:45.078 --> 09:47.140
He just... He fell asleep.

09:50.700 --> 09:55.023
- Did you hold him?
- OK, the trolley, the capsule,

09:55.024 --> 09:58.917
the capsule was on the trolley,
and the... With the luggage.

09:58.918 --> 10:01.157
We went to the car-hire desk

10:01.158 --> 10:03.438
I got us... I got us a coffee.

10:11.358 --> 10:12.678
Jo, the medicine.

10:15.918 --> 10:17.198
What?

10:20.038 --> 10:22.317
Your medicine. Noah's medicine.

10:22.318 --> 10:24.158
They were in the same clear bottles.

10:25.478 --> 10:28.540
No. No. I ta... I tasted it.
Mine, mine...

10:30.598 --> 10:32.278
I tasted it bef...

10:33.278 --> 10:37.677
I tasted it before I gave it to him.
Mine... Mine tastes different.

10:37.678 --> 10:41.860
Jo, you were exhausted and out
of your mind on that flight.

10:47.038 --> 10:48.318
Mm!

11:50.198 --> 11:52.277
I've got to get some milk in for you.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.597
Oh, thank you,
that's very thoughtful of you.

11:54.598 --> 11:56.038
How old is your baby?

12:01.438 --> 12:03.118
Three months and 17 days.

12:04.478 --> 12:07.518
We're really exhausted, Mrs Wilson.
Thank you for the milk.

12:16.558 --> 12:18.997
It's just... It's plane food.

12:18.998 --> 12:21.757
- Can I get her anything?
- Oh, no. I'll let you know.

12:21.758 --> 12:24.758
- I'm just next door.
- Great. Great, thank you.

12:50.398 --> 12:51.918
Why don't you put him down?

13:06.758 --> 13:08.718
Alistair, we should go to the police.

13:10.158 --> 13:12.118
We should go to the police.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.118
Jo...

13:23.438 --> 13:25.238
...you'll be charged with manslaughter.

13:29.038 --> 13:30.078
Do you understand?

13:31.758 --> 13:32.998
You will go to prison.

13:34.798 --> 13:36.518
I will never get Chloe.

13:38.438 --> 13:40.517
Our lives will be destroyed.

13:40.518 --> 13:44.197
I don't care. I don't care.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.740
No, listen to me. Listen to me.

13:49.838 --> 13:52.717
You don't deserve to
be punished for this.

13:52.718 --> 13:55.797
You don't deserve to be punished
for this, but the world...

13:55.798 --> 13:58.580
The world will not agree with me.

14:00.878 --> 14:04.037
But you and me, together,

14:04.038 --> 14:06.740
we can make our own way through this.

14:09.678 --> 14:11.158
Do you trust me?

14:14.438 --> 14:15.598
Yes.

14:16.718 --> 14:18.238
I know we can do this.

14:19.878 --> 14:20.918
I know it.

14:22.118 --> 14:27.438
But you must trust me,
and we must do it together, OK?

14:30.358 --> 14:32.677
You can't abandon me on this.

14:32.678 --> 14:34.860
You can't abandon me on this, OK?

15:02.598 --> 15:05.278
- Hi.
- Peter will be here in a moment.

15:16.878 --> 15:20.397
Hi. I, erm, I came in as
soon as I got the message.

15:20.398 --> 15:21.997
- Thanks, Alistair.
- What is it?

15:21.998 --> 15:25.077
We just wanted to run over some of
the details of the afternoon

15:25.078 --> 15:27.638
- when you arrived in Melbourne.
- We'll record this.

15:29.878 --> 15:34.357
So, erm, am I the suspect now?

15:34.358 --> 15:35.780
Just some questions.

15:36.838 --> 15:41.357
So you arrived at the
cottage at about 4.30.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.357
What did you do during that time?

15:43.358 --> 15:46.637
Oh, er, OK.

15:46.638 --> 15:50.517
I unpacked, had a shower,
put on some washing,

15:50.518 --> 15:54.437
checked some e-mails, had a nap for
about an hour, had something to eat.

15:54.438 --> 15:56.797
All Noah's clothes and blankets
and the covers

15:56.798 --> 15:58.557
from the baby capsule were washed.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.358
Yes. Yeah, I think so.

16:01.718 --> 16:06.397
And you both stayed in the cottage
until you left to go to Elizabeth's?

16:06.398 --> 16:09.780
- Yes.
- Did you put Noah into the travel-cot?

16:14.878 --> 16:17.637
Er, possibly.

16:17.638 --> 16:19.420
Did you change his nappy?

16:20.478 --> 16:21.798
Probably.

16:23.318 --> 16:26.797
You said you had something
to eat at the cottage.

16:26.798 --> 16:28.678
- Yes.
- What did you have to eat?

16:33.958 --> 16:37.877
What? What did I have to eat?
A sandwich or something.

16:37.878 --> 16:40.158
That night is a blur. I'm sorry.

16:46.278 --> 16:47.718
Have you found something?

16:51.238 --> 16:53.100
Do you know something?

16:53.798 --> 16:57.100
There's no physical evidence
of Noah at the cottage.

17:09.117 --> 17:15.436
So, so you have no leads,
your investigation's stalled,

17:15.438 --> 17:16.998
and now you turn on us?

17:25.198 --> 17:26.558
OK, can...?

17:28.438 --> 17:34.117
Can I ask you to be very careful
when speaking with Joanna,

17:34.118 --> 17:38.980
that you don't push her. OK?

18:07.158 --> 18:09.517
Please. I have nothing to say.
I wish I did.

18:09.518 --> 18:11.238
Alistair, did you kill your son?

18:19.278 --> 18:20.780
Excuse me.

18:25.198 --> 18:26.438
Jo?

18:32.038 --> 18:33.998
Jo?

18:35.838 --> 18:37.597
- Jo.
- Mm.

18:37.598 --> 18:39.837
- Come on, wake up.
- Sleepy...

18:39.838 --> 18:42.717
Jo. Jo. Wake up.

18:42.718 --> 18:44.478
- Come on. Wake up!
- Sleep...

18:57.318 --> 18:58.678
Just leave me.

19:09.478 --> 19:13.398
Fuck off.
Fuck off, Jesus Christ.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.557
Hi. You got the draft of the article?

19:40.558 --> 19:42.557
Yeah. It's good, thanks.

19:42.558 --> 19:45.677
Look, erm, I'm really worried
about the level of competency

19:45.678 --> 19:47.277
of this investigation.

19:47.278 --> 19:48.878
Something needs to be said.

19:50.598 --> 19:52.917
- Publish?
- It's up to you.

19:52.918 --> 19:55.060
But I can have no connection, OK?

19:55.878 --> 19:57.220
I need them on my side.

19:58.078 --> 20:01.198
- Hang in there, yeah?
- Thanks, mate. Bye.

20:57.118 --> 20:58.557
- Where is it?
- Jo...

20:58.558 --> 21:00.557
- Where is it?!
- Jo...

21:00.558 --> 21:01.917
Alistair, where have you put it?

21:01.918 --> 21:04.037
Jo, I'm sure whatever it is,
We'll find it.

21:04.038 --> 21:05.438
It's all I have!

21:07.092 --> 21:09.692
Mum, do you want to just
give us a moment?

21:09.878 --> 21:11.558
- Sure.
- Thank you.

21:15.718 --> 21:18.957
You can't keep it.
It has the medicine on it.

21:18.958 --> 21:21.677
The police know it's missing.
Don't be an idiot.

21:21.678 --> 21:24.557
Alistair, I need it. Give it to me.

21:24.558 --> 21:25.997
You're not ten years old.

21:25.998 --> 21:29.397
What you need is to take a step back,

21:29.398 --> 21:31.948
and think very carefully
about your next move.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.758
ALEX, ECHOING: Joanna.

22:33.998 --> 22:37.478
Joanna, are you OK?

22:44.264 --> 22:46.988
Alex? Come on.

22:47.998 --> 22:49.678
Bit early for a swim.

22:52.998 --> 22:54.518
Is everything all right?

22:55.598 --> 22:57.078
I think so.

23:00.198 --> 23:04.548
I'm sorry you were arrested.
That must've been...

23:06.758 --> 23:08.078
...horrible.

23:10.158 --> 23:11.478
Yeah, it was.

23:14.318 --> 23:15.958
Chloe was really shaken.

23:17.278 --> 23:18.598
She's a great girl.

23:21.838 --> 23:23.318
She is.

23:27.238 --> 23:29.708
Alistair wants her to
go and live with you.

23:30.678 --> 23:34.148
Do you want that? I mean, honestly.

23:35.878 --> 23:37.468
She's a teenage girl.

23:38.998 --> 23:42.078
I know fathers are important,
but she needs her mum.

23:48.358 --> 23:50.399
When Alistair wants something,

23:50.424 --> 23:54.948
he'll crush anything
and anyone to get it.

23:56.678 --> 23:58.038
That's what frightens me.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.668
He's so very manipulating of people.

24:03.838 --> 24:04.878
He did it to me.

24:07.158 --> 24:09.358
I never realised until I was out of it.

24:21.278 --> 24:22.478
Joanna...

24:25.518 --> 24:27.278
...be careful.

24:33.558 --> 24:38.308
The triangle? Can you explain
to the court what you mean?

24:39.398 --> 24:41.908
Joanna, Alistair and myself.

24:42.718 --> 24:44.988
It was a toxic set of relationships.

24:47.758 --> 24:51.308
I was... I was very frightened that
I was going to lose my daughter.

24:52.598 --> 24:57.748
I was determined to do anything in
my power to keep Chloe with me.

24:59.038 --> 25:02.708
How did Joanna and Alistair
react after you were arrested?

25:06.478 --> 25:08.237
It was a nightmare for me.

25:08.238 --> 25:10.708
I was furious.

25:12.238 --> 25:14.358
He appeared to have
gotten what he wanted.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.997
- What is this?
- They have a search warrant.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.917
Where have you been?

25:23.918 --> 25:25.157
I went for a walk.

25:25.158 --> 25:27.638
I didn't know where you were.
Don't do that again.

25:28.838 --> 25:30.037
They've finished up inside.

25:30.038 --> 25:31.877
We're going to move round
to the back garden.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.997
What's the justification for this?

25:33.998 --> 25:36.477
We had a call from a neighbour
who heard a baby crying.

25:36.478 --> 25:37.668
Really?

25:39.118 --> 25:40.838
We should've done this weeks ago.

26:06.878 --> 26:09.237
"Questions have been raised
about the competency of the

26:09.238 --> 26:10.797
"Australian investigation.

26:10.798 --> 26:13.597
"A particular concern is the lack
of crime scene evidence from the

26:13.598 --> 26:16.917
"site of Noah's abduction, the
possible loss of crucial evidence

26:16.918 --> 26:19.797
"from the hire car being moved
before forensics had arrived.

26:19.798 --> 26:21.148
Yes.

26:21.518 --> 26:23.508
McCallum, you're worth every penny.

26:24.838 --> 26:26.158
Who pays him?

26:29.398 --> 26:32.028
I paid him, to make the cops look bad.

26:32.788 --> 26:34.517
I don't think a neighbour
called the station.

26:34.518 --> 26:36.478
I think they just wanted
to search the house.

26:38.518 --> 26:39.757
That's nice.

26:39.758 --> 26:41.518
Are you taking that with you today?

26:43.405 --> 26:45.005
I think he looks sad in this one.

26:49.371 --> 26:50.571
Please.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.748
Just give me your best
for this TV interview.

26:55.465 --> 26:56.705
Give me your best today.

26:58.151 --> 26:59.471
We need it.

27:00.238 --> 27:02.637
Take a couple of these.
They'll relax you.

27:02.638 --> 27:05.308
No. I don't... I don't want them.
I don't need them.

27:10.638 --> 27:12.238
Let's go sit in the sun for a bit.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.077
Sure.

27:18.078 --> 27:20.277
I've been thinking
about the day on the plane.

27:20.278 --> 27:22.557
I know I did a taste test. I know it.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.917
Because there was this lady
sat behind me and she asked me

27:24.918 --> 27:27.038
what I was doing,
and I explained it to her.

27:28.678 --> 27:30.198
What if it was something else?

27:31.398 --> 27:34.037
You can't trust your memory.

27:34.038 --> 27:36.397
You were... You were exhausted
and stressed on the plane.

27:36.398 --> 27:37.997
You were out of your head with fatigue.

27:37.998 --> 27:39.717
Yeah, but if it was something else?

27:39.718 --> 27:41.477
I mean, he was always crying.

27:41.478 --> 27:43.437
Maybe he had a...

27:43.438 --> 27:45.477
I don't know, a condition
we didn't know about.

27:45.478 --> 27:47.597
- It's too late, Jo.
- Is it?

27:47.598 --> 27:48.708
Why?

27:49.278 --> 27:50.957
We could go to Peter.

27:50.958 --> 27:52.477
We could tell him the whole truth.

27:52.478 --> 27:55.677
Maybe they can do an autopsy on
Noah and they can tell us.

27:55.678 --> 27:58.637
Alistair, they could tell us
what truly happened to him.

27:58.638 --> 28:00.077
We are way past that point, Jo.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.917
Are we? Why? Why?

28:01.918 --> 28:04.317
We would be hammered if it
was revealed that we'd lied

28:04.318 --> 28:06.157
and fabricated Noah's disappearance.

28:06.158 --> 28:08.837
We would face charges,
perjury, lying to the police.

28:08.838 --> 28:10.653
- Think it through.
- We should have gone to the police.

28:10.654 --> 28:13.237
- We should have gone.
- We were exhausted and in shock,

28:13.238 --> 28:14.918
but what's done is done.

28:17.518 --> 28:19.758
Now we need to keep looking forward.

28:23.318 --> 28:24.358
You know...

28:26.078 --> 28:30.388
...you know that I will
never, ever blame you.

28:41.832 --> 28:42.952
Thank you.

28:45.531 --> 28:47.451
Now, this interview today,

28:47.476 --> 28:49.956
it'll get the focus back on
the search for Noah and off us.

28:49.981 --> 28:53.021
The press, the public, everyone
needs to be looking for him.

28:54.878 --> 28:56.038
Are you up for it?

29:01.478 --> 29:02.798
I think I can do it.

29:07.838 --> 29:09.158
With your help.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.038
OK.

30:23.958 --> 30:25.358
Where is he?

30:32.478 --> 30:34.348
There's a beach not far here.

30:37.158 --> 30:38.908
I used to go when I was a kid.

30:42.918 --> 30:45.748
There was this amazing tree there.

30:47.998 --> 30:49.908
I used to think it was a magic tree.

30:54.718 --> 30:56.358
And the tree, it was still there?

30:59.318 --> 31:01.278
Yes. Still there.

31:08.638 --> 31:09.838
Is it beautiful?

31:12.598 --> 31:14.388
Yes. It's beautiful.

31:19.718 --> 31:22.388
Al... There's no turning back now.

31:25.438 --> 31:27.038
You understand that, don't you?

31:46.998 --> 31:48.637
No, we're about to go in.

31:48.638 --> 31:50.197
Sorry, one sec.

31:50.198 --> 31:51.637
Excuse me?

31:51.638 --> 31:55.237
Hi, can you dull back the eyes?
It's just a bit heavy.

31:55.238 --> 31:57.997
And waterproof as much of it as possible.

31:57.998 --> 31:59.078
Thank you.

32:03.238 --> 32:08.797
So that's the moment you realised
your four-month-old son was gone.

32:08.798 --> 32:10.957
Vanished from the back of your car.

32:10.958 --> 32:13.638
Can you recall what you
were thinking in that moment?

32:15.478 --> 32:16.598
I...

32:18.238 --> 32:21.077
I was thinking, "Where is he?"

32:21.078 --> 32:22.948
To absolute terror.

32:24.504 --> 32:25.824
Like sliding down a mountain.

32:28.598 --> 32:31.117
I just... I kept just saying
to myself over and over,

32:31.118 --> 32:32.838
"Where is he? Where is he?"

32:33.918 --> 32:36.037
Do the police have any leads,

32:36.038 --> 32:39.717
or any idea what has happened
to your baby son?

32:39.718 --> 32:42.948
This is what's so hard.
A baby can't just disappear.

32:43.798 --> 32:47.397
Someone, somewhere knows
what happened to him.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.948
Knows where he is.

32:49.518 --> 32:52.922
I'd like to ask you how you're
coping with the allegations

32:52.923 --> 32:56.517
that you had something to do
with your son's disappearance?

32:56.518 --> 32:58.837
We can't stop people thinking
what they want, but what's

32:58.838 --> 33:02.468
most upsetting is it takes away
from the search for our boy.

33:03.318 --> 33:07.117
That's where we want to see the
energy of the press and the police.

33:07.118 --> 33:08.318
Can I...?

33:09.758 --> 33:11.988
- Can I say something?
- Of course.

33:17.558 --> 33:21.148
I just want to say something
to whoever has Noah.

33:23.318 --> 33:30.068
Firstly, I... I want to say
thank you for looking after him.

33:34.838 --> 33:36.278
But he's our son...

33:39.678 --> 33:43.268
...and our lives are destroyed
by your actions. If you...

33:43.918 --> 33:45.838
Sorry. SHE SNIFFS:

33:51.637 --> 33:56.828
If you have him, or if you know
of anybody who has him, please...

33:59.558 --> 34:01.828
...please let him come home to us.

34:04.158 --> 34:06.428
We will never stop looking for Noah

34:07.118 --> 34:10.197
and we will never stop
believing that he's out there

34:10.197 --> 34:11.987
and that he will return to us.

34:14.438 --> 34:15.757
How can I leave?

34:18.118 --> 34:20.428
How can I leave if I
don't know where he is?

34:21.638 --> 34:23.038
How can I go home?

34:25.398 --> 34:27.917
I can't, I can't.

34:27.918 --> 34:29.668
I can't ever leave.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.556
Sorry.

34:31.558 --> 34:32.918
OK. Can we stop now, please?

34:37.438 --> 34:40.757
You went off script, with that,
"How can I ever leave the country?"

34:43.158 --> 34:44.318
I wasn't acting.

34:50.398 --> 34:52.996
We can check into the hotel
and then I thought we might get

34:52.998 --> 34:55.717
- something to eat.
- Is it far? I might walk.

34:55.717 --> 34:57.036
All right.

34:57.038 --> 34:59.668
But what if you're recognised?

35:05.878 --> 35:06.918
Jean-Louise?

35:08.078 --> 35:10.788
Jean-Louise Talbot. She's our publicist.

35:12.158 --> 35:14.478
She does work for me
back home, for the party.

35:18.478 --> 35:20.037
I wasn't aware we had such a thing.

35:20.038 --> 35:23.477
She contacted me a week or so ago,
asked if she could help.

35:23.478 --> 35:24.598
That's what she does.

35:26.878 --> 35:28.517
So why didn't you tell me about her?

35:28.518 --> 35:30.038
To be honest, I don't know.

35:31.238 --> 35:33.237
She organised this interview.

35:33.238 --> 35:34.788
Negotiated the fee.

35:37.558 --> 35:39.237
We get paid for that?

35:39.238 --> 35:40.828
Yes, of course.

35:42.838 --> 35:48.028
To help pay for the journalists
who write the articles.

35:48.478 --> 35:50.357
That's right. While my job's on hold,

35:50.358 --> 35:51.517
there's no money coming in.

35:51.518 --> 35:53.677
We still have the mortgage and expenses.

35:53.678 --> 35:55.533
After that interview, Alistair, our faces

35:55.558 --> 35:57.093
are going to be known even more.

35:57.118 --> 35:59.837
A new story will come along
and we'll be old news.

35:59.838 --> 36:02.837
Alistair, look,
look at what is happening.

36:02.838 --> 36:06.357
OK, I am trying to do my best for us.

36:06.358 --> 36:09.198
I am trying to hold it all together.

36:10.798 --> 36:15.077
But don't forget, you're not
the only one mourning.

36:15.078 --> 36:17.437
- My son is dead.
- Because of me.

36:17.438 --> 36:21.113
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

36:58.878 --> 36:59.918
Hey.

37:01.158 --> 37:02.997
Smuggled this in.

37:02.998 --> 37:04.598
There's no vase in the hotel room.

37:10.398 --> 37:11.718
OK. I'll get one.

37:15.078 --> 37:18.153
You don't have to fix everything.

37:21.118 --> 37:22.558
It's a fucking vase.

37:36.398 --> 37:39.513
Jo, what do you want me to do?

37:40.278 --> 37:43.117
I want to tell the truth!
That is what I want.

37:43.118 --> 37:45.357
I'm sorry. This is my life.

37:45.358 --> 37:47.477
I like my life.
I don't want to go to jail.

37:47.478 --> 37:50.277
That's not my story
and I don't deserve it.

37:50.278 --> 37:53.073
And I do! Don't I?

37:55.198 --> 37:56.598
Do you know what I realised?

37:58.518 --> 38:02.753
I'll never, ever be able to talk
about this, honestly, to anybody.

38:04.038 --> 38:05.158
Ever.

38:07.878 --> 38:10.198
For the rest of my life,
I'm going to have to...

38:11.558 --> 38:13.797
...carry this.

38:13.798 --> 38:15.513
You can talk to me, Jo.

38:20.918 --> 38:24.003
OK. Can you promise me that you
won't do anything

38:24.004 --> 38:26.597
without talking to me
and telling me first?

38:26.598 --> 38:28.118
We are in this together.

38:44.958 --> 38:48.398
God. How good is it to talk without
thinking someone's listening in?

38:54.078 --> 38:55.638
I'm still worried.

38:56.718 --> 38:58.997
What are you worried about?

38:58.998 --> 39:00.637
Peter and Lorna were asking questions

39:00.638 --> 39:02.637
about what we did at the Cottage.

39:02.638 --> 39:03.917
And?

39:03.918 --> 39:06.677
Why were there no nappies
in the rubbish bin?

39:06.678 --> 39:08.873
What did we eat? For God's sake.

39:09.798 --> 39:11.494
- What did you say?
- I was vague.

39:11.495 --> 39:14.757
I said a sandwich, or something.

39:14.758 --> 39:16.833
I should have said that we used the BBQ.

39:17.918 --> 39:20.397
I cleaned it. Every little bit
of ash is in the ground.

39:20.398 --> 39:23.157
Yes. But Mrs Wilson told police she
always leaves the barbecue set

39:23.158 --> 39:25.633
and ready to go. Ours was empty of wood.

39:26.358 --> 39:28.437
If it comes up...

39:28.438 --> 39:31.717
say that we used it and cleaned it.

39:31.718 --> 39:35.553
And that you took the nappies and
put them in a rubbish bin in town.

39:51.358 --> 39:52.958
There is nothing to celebrate.

40:03.511 --> 40:05.551
- Where is it?
- What?

40:05.718 --> 40:06.958
The bib!

40:13.638 --> 40:14.958
I got rid of it.

40:18.318 --> 40:19.953
- No?
- Yes.

40:26.398 --> 40:27.878
Alistair, you promised me.

40:30.478 --> 40:32.237
You promised me! Where is it?

40:32.238 --> 40:34.437
- I'm sorry.
- Alistair, where is it?

40:34.438 --> 40:36.277
I'm sorry. It had to go.

40:36.278 --> 40:39.513
It had to. It's gone. It doesn't exist.

40:42.598 --> 40:44.158
It was all I had!

40:47.358 --> 40:48.993
It was all I had left.

40:51.958 --> 40:54.193
How could you be so fucking cruel!

40:57.038 --> 40:59.477
You are the most ungrateful
person I've ever met.

40:59.478 --> 41:01.557
Oh, really?
What, am I supposed to thank you?

41:01.558 --> 41:04.313
Well, actually, yes.

41:10.038 --> 41:11.518
You know your problem?

41:13.371 --> 41:14.811
You're poisonous.

41:20.318 --> 41:21.558
Get out.

41:22.964 --> 41:24.044
Get out.

41:28.078 --> 41:29.993
Take some flowers to your mum!

41:59.998 --> 42:01.278
Hey.

42:02.558 --> 42:03.798
Hello.

42:05.598 --> 42:07.553
- Is she home?
- Nope.

42:08.238 --> 42:09.718
She's got netball practice.

42:10.998 --> 42:13.033
Well, maybe I could wait.

42:14.338 --> 42:15.378
We can talk.

42:16.358 --> 42:20.513
It's about time we had
a proper, open talk about things.

42:25.278 --> 42:26.558
Something for you.

42:46.598 --> 42:48.078
This kitchen.

42:50.818 --> 42:51.858
Same kettle.

42:54.438 --> 42:56.038
Where did we get it?

42:57.158 --> 43:01.197
A garage sale in Lorne, I think.

43:01.198 --> 43:03.113
Lorne, yeah.

43:05.198 --> 43:07.438
Why were we there?

43:09.378 --> 43:11.058
What did you want to discuss?

43:17.205 --> 43:18.725
Sorry.

43:22.358 --> 43:24.638
I was just trying to see what
having a normal conversation

43:24.639 --> 43:26.193
felt like again.

43:36.038 --> 43:37.438
How's Joanna?

43:39.718 --> 43:42.953
She's very strong,
but I'm worried about her.

43:46.585 --> 43:47.905
How are you?

43:50.958 --> 43:53.158
The police turned this house upside-down.

43:54.398 --> 43:57.957
Tipped out every drawer, every cupboard.

43:57.958 --> 44:00.198
Now everyone looks at me
like I'm a criminal.

44:16.158 --> 44:17.598
That sound.

44:20.631 --> 44:22.271
Sounds like home.

44:28.758 --> 44:32.117
We had a good thing
going on here, didn't we?

44:32.118 --> 44:33.793
Remind me why we left here?

44:36.998 --> 44:38.758
You were offered a job in Scotland.

44:41.438 --> 44:43.158
Imagine if I'd said no to that job.

44:44.718 --> 44:47.833
If we'd stayed here, raised Chloe...

44:49.038 --> 44:51.393
...maybe had another baby or two.

44:55.331 --> 44:56.811
You always wanted three.

44:58.445 --> 44:59.845
Didn't you?

45:02.198 --> 45:05.553
It wasn't Scotland that broke us up, Al.

45:06.798 --> 45:10.233
It was your affairs
and your constant lying.

45:12.838 --> 45:15.198
That would've happened
anywhere in the world.

45:17.764 --> 45:18.924
Here we are.

45:20.118 --> 45:22.273
Going to court to fight for custody.

45:24.998 --> 45:27.957
I can offer her a terrific education.

45:27.958 --> 45:32.073
Private school. She can have access
to any university in Europe.

45:34.038 --> 45:35.553
She's all I've got.

45:37.118 --> 45:39.237
I wouldn't know who I was without her.

45:39.238 --> 45:42.357
No. See, here's the thing.

45:42.358 --> 45:47.877
What any good parent would do is
put Chloe's best interests ahead

45:47.878 --> 45:50.073
of their fear of being alone.

45:59.038 --> 46:01.077
I think you should leave.

46:01.078 --> 46:02.277
I'm waiting for Chloe.

46:02.278 --> 46:03.833
Well, I don't want you here.

46:08.398 --> 46:10.878
Is this some fantasy of yours, is it?

46:12.438 --> 46:14.077
Telling me to get out of your house.

46:14.078 --> 46:18.237
The house, mind you, bought
with my parents' deposit.

46:18.238 --> 46:19.797
Well, go on.

46:19.798 --> 46:21.197
Go on. Do it.

46:21.198 --> 46:22.478
Do it.

46:25.758 --> 46:27.638
"Get out of my house, Al!"

46:34.118 --> 46:36.358
Why don't you finish
that off before dinner?

46:39.880 --> 46:41.880
Fuck off!

46:58.758 --> 47:00.638
You're both in a terrible situation.

47:01.878 --> 47:03.278
What are the police saying?

47:04.518 --> 47:06.958
Nothing yet.
Loads of people think we did it.

47:08.198 --> 47:09.638
Oh, idiots.

47:11.138 --> 47:12.538
Kirsty.

47:18.838 --> 47:20.278
He's dead.

47:22.558 --> 47:25.473
He's dead and it's my fault.

47:30.238 --> 47:32.277
For God's sake, Jo.

47:32.278 --> 47:34.033
You can't do this to yourself.

47:34.958 --> 47:37.873
Noah's alive. I know he is.

47:39.798 --> 47:41.038
You can't give up hope.

49:20.398 --> 49:22.833
He was wearing a blue
grow-suit like this one.

49:24.318 --> 49:26.997
Whoever has him, please
give him back to us.

49:26.998 --> 49:29.437
I have made an examination
of both Joanna and Alistair

49:29.438 --> 49:31.757
at the press conference.

49:31.758 --> 49:35.317
At 2:55, the female rubs her nose,

49:35.318 --> 49:39.033
indicating what she's
about to say is not true.

49:40.918 --> 49:42.318
We miss him so much.

49:46.958 --> 49:50.357
At 3:05, the male's left
arm can be seen squeezing

49:50.358 --> 49:53.557
the female's left shoulder.

49:53.558 --> 49:56.077
His action could constitute a tapping...

49:56.078 --> 49:59.397
- Shut up, shut up.
- ..and signal to the female.

49:59.398 --> 50:00.803
We need him home safe.

50:02.678 --> 50:04.713
- Please...
- Oh, my God.

50:05.838 --> 50:08.953
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

51:45.158 --> 51:47.037
- What are you doing in here?
- I knocked.

51:47.038 --> 51:49.277
- I thought you were here.
- You can't be in here.

51:49.278 --> 51:51.117
Sorry. It was... It was open.

51:51.118 --> 51:52.918
You can't be in here.

51:58.998 --> 52:01.717
Do you want to see me?
What do you want to see me about?

52:01.718 --> 52:04.433
I was... I was hoping for an update.

52:05.118 --> 52:08.353
I will call you as soon as I have
any real leads or news, OK?

52:11.638 --> 52:16.877
I mean, what are you guys actually doing?

52:16.878 --> 52:20.518
I mean, arresting, arresting poor
Alex? She's absolutely devastated!

52:28.598 --> 52:31.237
We are doing everything that we can.

52:31.238 --> 52:33.037
We're hoping that the
60 Minutes interview

52:33.038 --> 52:35.078
is going to bring somebody forward.

52:37.478 --> 52:40.997
What happened to him, Peter?
What happened to him?

52:40.998 --> 52:42.318
Alistair.

52:44.518 --> 52:47.298
Go home and take care of Jo.

52:55.838 --> 52:57.913
You're not going to give up, are you?

53:03.278 --> 53:05.278
You're going to give up looking for him?

53:06.598 --> 53:11.557
This investigation is going to
stay open until we have no leads

53:11.558 --> 53:16.233
to follow up on. Until then, it's
staying open, we're not giving up.

53:21.958 --> 53:23.318
Thank you, Pete.

55:03.198 --> 55:04.999
No, Al, please!

55:11.718 --> 55:15.279
Jo? Can you come here, please?

55:26.318 --> 55:27.918
Come and watch the interview.

55:29.651 --> 55:31.091
No, thanks.

55:38.198 --> 55:40.037
It's important. You need to watch it.

55:40.038 --> 55:41.957
No, YOU need to stop
telling me what to say,

55:41.958 --> 55:43.559
do and think every second!

55:44.838 --> 55:46.237
And you need to stop lying to me.

55:46.238 --> 55:47.919
You are out of control, Jo.

55:53.038 --> 55:54.959
I want to see where he's buried.

55:55.558 --> 55:57.318
- You need to tell me!
- Stop!

56:02.238 --> 56:04.279
Be very careful, Jo.

56:06.358 --> 56:08.198
I should never have given him to you.

56:12.158 --> 56:13.518
I was a coward.

56:36.478 --> 56:38.597
You were a partnership.

56:38.598 --> 56:42.197
A relationship that was under
a huge amount of stress.

56:42.198 --> 56:45.999
But that doesn't explain what
changed between you and Alistair.

56:49.378 --> 56:50.818
I woke up.

56:53.278 --> 56:55.278
Can you talk about what you mean by that?

56:57.425 --> 56:59.359
Back in Australia, I...

57:02.238 --> 57:07.319
...suddenly saw through
all the lies, the manipulation.

57:10.318 --> 57:13.999
The only way to cope with it
was to put on a mask for him.

57:15.551 --> 57:16.871
For the world.

57:17.931 --> 57:19.571
What lies are you talking about?

57:24.711 --> 57:26.111
I was betrayed.

57:29.078 --> 57:30.718
That's enough for you to know.

57:51.918 --> 57:55.197
Call the indictment of
Her Majesties Advocate,

57:55.198 --> 57:58.719
against Joanna Louise Lindsay.

58:01.638 --> 58:04.359
Are you Joanna Louise Lindsay?

58:05.798 --> 58:06.998
Yes.

58:08.238 --> 58:10.397
I appear on behalf of the panel,

58:10.398 --> 58:12.957
Joanna Louise Lindsay,

58:12.958 --> 58:16.357
who pleads not guilty
to the indictment being

58:16.358 --> 58:18.437
a single charge of the murder

58:18.438 --> 58:21.519
of Alistair Jonathan Robertson.
