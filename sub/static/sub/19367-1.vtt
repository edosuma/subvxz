Because his tongue is stuck to the mailbox.

05:51.825 --> 05:53.798
Why did he lick the mailbox?

05:54.048 --> 05:59.322

member from high school will be there.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.717
What are you doing now?

10:24.301 --> 10:28.688
I just got my real estate license.
- Real estates.

10:28.938 --> 10:33.032
Yes, this is just a temporary job, Until
I faced over the real estate full time.

10:33.282 --> 10:36.379

estate, With Lawn and Foster.

10:36.629 --> 10:39.529

- Who are you with?

10:42.157 --> 10:43.859
I have not decided yet.

10:44.109 --> 10:47.159

and Foster, They look nice.

11:19.356 --> 11:21.456
Hello.
- Hello, Miss Lorkowski.

11:22.695 --> 11:27.045
This is Mrs Sears from the sandy elementary school.
Oscar is in trouble again.

11:27.755 --> 11:31.955
His teacher and the principal are in
conference And you really should talk to them.

11:50.915 --> 11:53.865
It is not just about this incident.

11:54.316 --> 12:02.266
There are several episodes during the last
year, Oscar was engage in disruptive behavior.

12:02.783 --> 12:06.555
There was incident at the gym class...
- I have paid the damages for that.

12:06.805 --> 12:09.805
And the time when he locked
Jeremy Johnsten in a...

12:12.473 --> 12:16.523
What did he do this time?
- Now its licking.

12:17.665 --> 12:21.375
First it was a Pencil Sharpener
And then the aquarium.

12:21.625 --> 12:25.088
It is unsanitary And disturbing
to the other children.

12:25.488 --> 12:32.613
We feel that Oscar will benefit, In an environment
where he can receive specialize attention.

12:33.013 --> 12:38.097
What does that mean?
Specialize attention?

12:38.647 --> 12:40.797
He licks my leg.

12:43.590 --> 12:47.120
In situations like this, We
generally recommend medication.

12:47.370 --> 12:50.358
I'm not doing that.
- Actually It is not a recommendation,

12:50.608 --> 12:52.658
But more as required.

12:53.782 --> 12:57.932
There are many drugs that are
effective, With few side effects.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.830
We all feel this is the best
solution For everybody involved.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.729
Yeah sure.
Come on.

13:04.979 --> 13:08.229
I'm sorry Mom.

13:08.594 --> 13:11.244
One thing for sure, We are
not coming back here.

13:13.896 --> 13:17.046
We just have to figure something else.

13:18.389 --> 13:20.339
I just have to figure something else.

Put them down over there.

35:03.455 --> 35:07.641
This is great, but you guys don't want to consider
getting out there and try to marketing yourself?

35:07.891 --> 35:11.833
Marketing ourself?
- Like funeral home,

35:12.083 --> 35:13.486
Property managers.

35:13.736 --> 35:16.638
If you get into insurance companies,
They will throw you tons of work.

35:16.888 --> 35:19.488
Really?
Insurance companies?

35:20.660 --> 35:22.710
This is a really good idea.

35:24.085 --> 35:27.110
Are you guys have BBP right?
- A BB what?

35:27.360 --> 35:30.060
A BBP certification?

35:30.444 --> 35:32.844

36:02.757 --> 36:07.446
The girls have done their own business.
They're doing crime scene and trauma cleanup.

36:07.696 --> 36:10.361
It is a real gross industry.
- Sounds kinda Gorey.

36:10.611 --> 36:12.444
That can be, can be.

36:12.694 --> 36:15.756
We are gonna be taking some contaminated
material to the incinerator,

36:16.006 --> 36:18.033
So we need gonna some
space in the back.

36:18.283 --> 36:20.206

36:20.456 --> 36:22.706
It costs $ 1999.00

36:23.633 --> 36:25.883
Any room to count down on that?

36:26.379 --> 36:30.804
That is the ground floor,  I'm probably
gonna lose money on this one.

36:31.054 --> 36:33.656
I just want to make room for some
new products. - We can pay cash.

36:33.906 --> 36:36.363
We have some cash.
We have some cash we can put down.

36:36.613 --> 36:39.295
Cash is good.
- What about all this rust?

36:39.545 --> 36:41.327
That's character.
- That's bullshit.

36:41.577 --> 36:46.381
We were just in the Motor Market in
Loomis, They had a Chevy G SERIES?

36:46.631 --> 36:49.731
For $ 1900.00.
- With power steering?

36:51.845 --> 36:54.185
What is this?
- It's a radio station.

36:54.435 --> 36:58.898
What you do with that is you push down on
that thing and held that other thing down.

36:59.148 --> 37:01.997
And it makes your voice got
up to the air in radio waves.

37:02.247 --> 37:04.947
Right into the heaven.
- The heaven?

37:06.390 --> 37:08.540
How about a test drive?

37:08.914 --> 37:10.714
There you go.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.960
I HOPE YOU CAN MAKE IT, CAN'T

shit in high school, but what are you now?

39:19.429 --> 39:21.179
Nothing.

39:30.715 --> 39:34.034
Okay, you got $ 20 to
buy for three pizzas.

39:34.284 --> 39:39.886
Each pizza will cost three dollars.
No, let's say five dollars.

39:40.136 --> 39:42.836
You've got a coupon for two dollar off.

39:45.666 --> 39:48.283
The delivery boy shows up,
He is a friend from school,

39:48.533 --> 39:51.950
He is very very poor?
So you give him five dollars for tip.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.118
What do you end up with?

39:54.368 --> 39:58.954
Okay, you have two dollars
left, and spent 18.

39:59.204 --> 40:03.354
You just figure that out?
- Yeah, its not that hard.

40:05.990 --> 40:07.590
Here is Frank.

40:21.672 --> 40:25.170
That's it these are our shrimp.
That looks damn good.

40:25.420 --> 40:27.170
Slide them inside.

40:27.767 --> 40:29.817
How many boxes do we have?

40:34.315 --> 40:38.388
See, that's the difference between an ordinary
person and a person with business acumen.

40:38.638 --> 40:42.437
That is a good word for you
to remember, 'Business acumen'.

40:42.687 --> 40:44.637
We're going to be rich, pal.

40:47.336 --> 40:49.786
REGISTRATION FORM, PRIVATE SCHOOL

40:51.586 --> 40:54.786
We going to make our money grow
That is a smart way, it is capital,

40:55.036 --> 40:56.935
And you don' spend it,
You invest it.

40:57.185 --> 41:00.885
So in that way we can get our
SP250 and with money left over.

41:01.135 --> 41:02.473
What are you talking about?

41:02.723 --> 41:05.273
About binoculars that grandpa
getting me for my birthday.

41:07.111 --> 41:10.211
What binoculars Grandpa getting
you for your birthday?

41:13.098 --> 41:17.536
These binoculars. The got some internal
stabilizer thing and It is electronic.

41:17.786 --> 41:20.086
You can use it for Stargazer.

41:20.336 --> 41:24.736
And when it is cold outside it won't freeze.
- Honey come here.

41:24.986 --> 41:31.436
Listen to me, sometimes grandpa promises
thing and he really wants to make it happen.

41:31.686 --> 41:35.386
No, he is really going to
get them, He has a plan.

41:35.636 --> 41:37.686
He has a plan?

41:40.887 --> 41:43.487
Okay, if you say so.

41:45.587 --> 41:49.937
Squeeze out.
And again.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.694
Don't be nervous, people
do this all the time.

41:52.944 --> 41:55.044
I'm not nervous.
I'm fine.

41:58.291 --> 42:01.515
That's the needle?
Or that is just a funny cocktail straw.

42:01.765 --> 42:03.815
Trust me,
I am really good at this.

42:12.039 --> 42:15.989
Wasn't that fun?
- I think you might over sold it.

42:26.086 --> 42:28.810
There is a thing tonight...
Never mind.

42:29.060 --> 42:32.210
What?
- No, it's nothing, it's just um...

42:33.334 --> 42:38.428
My friend...
You wouldn't like it.

42:39.028 --> 42:40.728
I might like it.

42:44.896 --> 42:49.419
I knew you wouldn't find any good time here.
- No, I'm having a good time.

42:54.465 --> 42:55.783
No, thanks.

42:56.033 --> 42:59.733
This is just lab stuff, smell em.
- Yeah, thanks.

43:00.402 --> 43:02.702
Are you straight edge?

43:03.439 --> 43:08.407
No, I'm just...
- What?

43:09.007 --> 43:13.607
You'll just think its weird.
- What? No, I like weird stuff.

43:16.049 --> 43:19.041
Sometimes I think that when you get
high, or when you drink, or you...

43:19.291 --> 43:21.341
You don't drink either?

43:22.333 --> 43:26.326
I just think that when you do stuff
like that, It weakens you psychically,

43:26.576 --> 43:29.299
Like it creates cracks and then that
bad stuff come creeps into those crack

43:29.549 --> 43:33.449
And maybe never go away.

43:34.636 --> 43:37.836
Its weird.
- Sorry.

43:39.023 --> 43:42.223
You probably just tell
people, That you are Mormon.

43:43.468 --> 43:45.118
Maybe.

43:50.433 --> 43:53.633
Your boyfriend winning the necklace game.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.199
He is not really my boyfriend.

43:59.785 --> 44:02.285
Yes, it tickled my neck a little bit.

44:09.878 --> 44:12.528
You still have your whole necklace.

44:18.872 --> 44:20.722

This big pissed off God and he is right up in your
face and he is screaming at you, and he is so close.

54:06.242 --> 54:12.243
You can smell the metal from his breath.
- If you already live in the heaven,

54:12.493 --> 54:14.982
Where do you go when you die?

54:52.759 --> 54:55.433

models with just one hand.

01:04:10.718 --> 01:04:12.164
It is.

01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:35.970

- You need to calm down.

01:07:20.172 --> 01:07:24.631
I'm not going to forgive you.
- It was an accident.

01:07:24.881 --> 01:07:26.298
Oh my god.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:53.807
Sorry.
- Hey, Rose, are you okay?

01:07:54.057 --> 01:07:56.051
Everything is really horrible right now, you know.

01:07:56.301 --> 01:07:59.130
One...
- Oscar, is asleep in the back.

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.105
Okay, good, good.

01:08:01.355 --> 01:08:04.372
Is he...
Norah ruined everything.

01:08:04.848 --> 01:08:06.368
She burnt down a house.

01:08:06.618 --> 01:08:09.548
A house, she burnt
down the client house.

01:08:11.228 --> 01:08:14.429
How do you know?
- Carl, told me.

01:08:15.434 --> 01:08:18.950
How does he know?
- It is his job...

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.078
What he does.

01:08:22.818 --> 01:08:24.904
We burnt down a client's house.

01:08:25.154 --> 01:08:29.205
How do you gonna round that?
- Insurance.

01:08:31.053 --> 01:08:35.779
Oh... you see, I thought that I would get
a better rate, once I was certified.

01:08:39.296 --> 01:08:41.848
There is not much that I'm good at.

01:08:44.576 --> 01:08:48.370
I'm good at getting guys to want me,
Not date me or marry me, but want me.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.607
I am good at that.

01:08:52.397 --> 01:08:54.015
And...

01:08:55.654 --> 01:08:57.327
And cheering...

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:00.774
I was a really good at cheering.

01:09:02.564 --> 01:09:04.527
Cheering is good.

01:09:05.617 --> 01:09:08.716
Yes, but it is not so
marketable as you think.

01:09:27.068 --> 01:09:28.564
Hey Dad.

01:09:28.814 --> 01:09:30.850
Hi. - Do you mind keeping an
eye on Oscar for a while?

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.286
Yeah, sure. - I just got to go and
get my couple of shifts back.

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:39.100
Don't go back to be a maid.
That is not a good job for you.

01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:41.185
Dad, I need a job.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.188
I hold like about 40.000 dollars on that house
and on top of everything else's, i just...

01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:50.368
You're not getting 40000 dollars
by just cleaning houses.

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:53.140
I'll figure something to do.

01:09:53.747 --> 01:09:55.167
I will.

01:09:55.626 --> 01:09:59.704
Can I make a sandwich?
- Yeah, go ahead you know where everything is.

01:10:03.884 --> 01:10:06.069
Go make up with your sister.

01:10:07.442 --> 01:10:09.800
She is your sister,
go make up with her.

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:12.145
Dad... please.

01:10:20.857 --> 01:10:22.342
What's this?

01:10:23.679 --> 01:10:25.323
Just open it.

01:10:38.876 --> 01:10:40.860
Why do you have my mom's I.D.?

01:10:41.823 --> 01:10:45.781
I found it.
At work.

01:10:46.031 --> 01:10:48.029
Me and Rose did a job while back.

01:10:48.279 --> 01:10:52.499
And... there was a woman.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.251
Who i...

01:10:56.108 --> 01:10:57.810
Look, we're supposed to throw everything away.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:02.342
But i need you to kept that picture of you...
- Is this her fanny pack?

01:11:03.794 --> 01:11:05.815
I couldn't throw them away.

01:11:08.466 --> 01:11:10.200
You were following me that day.

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:13.171
I should have told you,
I know that and I..

01:11:13.421 --> 01:11:16.430
Felt so stupid and I just
got scared and I. ..

01:11:18.705 --> 01:11:22.200
I didn't know what the situation
was between you and your mom.

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:23.810
I do not know what went on.

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.482
But I just thought,
That everybody...

01:11:26.732 --> 01:11:29.403
That I would understand.
- You would understand?

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:32.387
My Mom was a pathetic drunk.

01:11:35.716 --> 01:11:40.714
I'm an idiot, I actually thought
that you were interested in me.

01:11:41.495 --> 01:11:43.780
I just wanted to do the right thing.

01:11:44.225 --> 01:11:46.566
Please don't.
- Don't call me.

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:01.660
You got that?
- Yeah.

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:05.808
I'm sure that I'll be able to turn this
around pretty quick , so... - Thank you.

01:12:06.058 --> 01:12:07.450
For everything.

01:12:08.626 --> 01:12:10.637
Are you coming to my party?

01:12:11.506 --> 01:12:13.630
We are having Oscar's birthday party...

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.535
At Hinkle's, on Saturday.
It would be great if you came.

01:12:16.785 --> 01:12:19.453
Sounds like a blast.

01:12:27.734 --> 01:12:31.600
I know what you're thinking Oscar, but the
one we saw at the store was full of gymics.

01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:33.600
The didn't has what these have.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.830
They didn't have the weight.
There's no history.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.194
Wow, is that an old Zeiss?

01:12:39.358 --> 01:12:41.854
This is really a classic
Binocular you got there.

01:12:43.182 --> 01:12:46.835
Sorry I'm late,
Look at you.

01:12:47.712 --> 01:12:49.540
Hi Dad.
- Hi, dear.

01:12:53.904 --> 01:12:55.297
Where are you going?

01:13:05.313 --> 01:13:07.179
.....

01:13:19.412 --> 01:13:21.060
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:13:22.214 --> 01:13:25.308
I know that you think,
I've ruined everything.

01:13:25.562 --> 01:13:28.443
And I'm fucked up really
huge, and I'm sorry, okay?

01:13:28.693 --> 01:13:30.159
You know what I don't get?

01:13:30.409 --> 01:13:33.459
Norah, is that I ask
you to do one thing.

01:13:33.922 --> 01:13:36.225
I can't even ask for you to do one
thing without you messing it up.

01:13:36.475 --> 01:13:39.250
I mean Jesus, Norah,  It's not like that i
don't have enough to deal with my own life.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.710
But now I have to take care of
you and on top of it i can't.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.171
It is too much, and i can't do it.
- I' am not asking you to.

01:13:45.505 --> 01:13:47.847
This business was
everything to me, Norah.

01:13:48.097 --> 01:13:50.291
But why you weren't there?
- I was going to be there.

01:13:50.541 --> 01:13:53.229
I told you I was gonna be
there, you just couldn't wait,

01:13:53.479 --> 01:13:54.555
To burnt the house down?

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:56.958
But you weren't there
And I couldn't...

01:13:57.208 --> 01:13:59.587
And I couldn't do it by myself.

01:14:03.565 --> 01:14:05.233
I just...

01:14:08.454 --> 01:14:10.267
I should have been there, I know.

01:14:10.517 --> 01:14:12.292
But...

01:14:17.101 --> 01:14:18.801
I just...

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:24.343
I really wanted to go to that baby shower.

01:14:25.937 --> 01:14:28.054
It was so stupid.

01:14:30.047 --> 01:14:33.380
Those girls looked at me,
like I was just a maid.

01:14:34.962 --> 01:14:37.276
You are much better than them, Rose.

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:43.454
What're you going to do now?

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.370
I don't know...

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.590
They said that i can get my
old job back, if I wanted.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.659
And I can put in
a good word for you.

01:14:52.743 --> 01:14:55.459
I don't need for you to
take care of me anymore.

01:14:57.858 --> 01:15:00.252
It's not your job
And it never was.

01:15:04.595 --> 01:15:08.322
Somebody have to take
care of you, Norah.

01:15:16.498 --> 01:15:19.377
You know what I remember
about her funeral?

01:15:23.892 --> 01:15:25.925
My shoes.

01:15:27.905 --> 01:15:30.185
They were too small
And my feet hurt.

01:15:30.435 --> 01:15:32.377
That is what I remember.

01:15:36.381 --> 01:15:38.405
You know what I remember?

01:15:42.773 --> 01:15:46.017
You wouldn't take off
your shoes after that.

01:15:48.223 --> 01:15:51.314
You wore them forever.
It drives me crazy.

01:16:05.878 --> 01:16:07.824
I'm still mad at you.

01:16:08.206 --> 01:16:10.730
All right.
- Really mad at you.

01:16:13.889 --> 01:16:17.128
I heard you build model airplanes?

01:16:19.423 --> 01:16:21.192
Do you made money in that?

01:16:21.902 --> 01:16:23.734
No, not really.

01:16:26.408 --> 01:16:28.419
Hey, what you've got?

01:16:29.152 --> 01:16:31.159
Winston gave it to me.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.191
Thank you.

01:16:33.445 --> 01:16:34.893
You are welcome.

01:16:35.389 --> 01:16:37.480
Have you open up my present?

01:16:40.201 --> 01:16:44.787
So the guy said that if you careful, they'll could
last for whole month, So you couldn't shower and shit.

01:16:45.037 --> 01:16:45.380
That is good.

01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:49.069
Now, these are guaranteed to
make you like a total bad-ass.

01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:51.733
What is that say?

01:16:52.286 --> 01:16:53.880
Little bastard.

01:16:56.006 --> 01:16:57.668
Custom-made.

01:16:58.965 --> 01:17:01.026
It's Cool, Norah.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.610
I think I'm taking a road trip.
- Where?

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.262
And how?
- In the van.

01:17:09.512 --> 01:17:12.062
No, I'm selling the van.
- What?

01:17:12.312 --> 01:17:15.430
Why sell the van?
- I can't afford the payment , guys, come on.

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.080
Just wait for a while.

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.267
It's your birthday.

01:17:26.764 --> 01:17:28.814
Happy birthday Oscar.

01:18:02.096 --> 01:18:03.850
Pick up, Pick up, Pick up.
- Hello.

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.405
Norah turn on the TV, channel 65.

01:18:16.616 --> 01:18:19.906
I probably shouldn't
But what you got for dessert?

01:18:20.156 --> 01:18:22.500
I recommend the pecan pie.

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:24.311
Are you sure?

01:18:31.682 --> 01:18:33.867
One pecan pie coming up.

01:19:33.195 --> 01:19:34.653
Hello?

01:19:43.692 --> 01:19:45.087
Mom?

01:19:50.076 --> 01:19:52.738
Today was Oscar eighth birthday.

01:19:53.961 --> 01:19:57.661
And we did a big thing for him
At Hinkle's.

01:19:58.785 --> 01:20:00.396
And Winston came.

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:06.115
After dinner Norah and
Oscar played senepede and...

01:20:06.715 --> 01:20:11.673
Put A.S.S. as their Initials and
gotten big trouble by the manager.

01:20:16.721 --> 01:20:19.465
I don't know
If you are in heaven.

01:20:19.715 --> 01:20:21.123
Or not.

01:20:22.529 --> 01:20:24.657
But I know that you're not here.

01:20:25.616 --> 01:20:27.947
And that is too bad for you.

01:20:28.809 --> 01:20:31.102
Because you've really missed out.

01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:35.636
You missed out on some really great stuff.

01:20:48.341 --> 01:20:50.481
I hope you can hear me.

01:21:29.063 --> 01:21:31.077
Hi Dad.
- Hi.

01:21:32.091 --> 01:21:33.723
I got to talk to you.

01:21:34.549 --> 01:21:36.850
I have to move in with you
and Oscar for a while.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.534
Why? - Just temporarily, just
until I got my own place.

01:21:41.504 --> 01:21:43.100
You lost the house?

01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:44.700
Dad, how could you lose the house?

01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:46.750
I didn't lose the house.
I sold the house.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.800
I have a very good business
opportunity and I took it.

01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:52.750
I hope its not shrimp.
- No, nothing fly by night.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.950
I have a partner, a really good
partner, Who knows the ropes?

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.549
And I'm going to be working under them.

01:22:04.543 --> 01:22:05.867
Dad?

01:22:14.842 --> 01:22:18.750
Since 1963? - Yes, it shows that we
got some stability, people like that.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:19.830
That is a lie.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:24.207
Its a business lie.
And that is different from a life lie.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.117
Okay.

01:22:26.385 --> 01:22:31.174
I can live with that.
- You'll be the boss.

01:22:36.324 --> 01:22:37.788
That is great.

01:23:19.446 --> 01:23:21.096
You'll get use to it.
