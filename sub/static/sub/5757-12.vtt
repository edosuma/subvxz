WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:06.140
ISN'T THAT GARRETT'S CAR?

00:06.174 --> 00:08.342
I THINK IT IS.
WHERE'S HE GOING?

00:08.376 --> 00:10.544
( all gasp )

00:10.578 --> 00:11.645
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT JASON'S HOUSE?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.547
SPENCER DESERVES
SOME ANSWERS.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.149
IT'S NONE OF YOUR
DAMN BUSINESS.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.817
COLLEGE WILL BE A GREAT
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.054
YOU'LL LOOK BACK AND REALIZE
JUST HOW NAIVE YOU WERE.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.155
REALLY?

00:21.189 --> 00:23.157
WHAT IS THAT?
LIQUID COURAGE.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.725
WANT SOME?
HIT ME.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.228
KATE WAS DRINKING TOO.
KATE'S NOT DRUNK.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.497
KATE JUST GAVE
A VERY TOUCHING TOAST...

00:29.530 --> 00:31.065
ALONE.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.367
YOU'RE DONE.
GIVE ME THE COMPUTER.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.536
NO, LET GO!
( heavy thud )

00:35.569 --> 00:37.205
MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?

00:37.238 --> 00:40.674
WHEN YOUR FATHER GETS HOME,
THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.644
HELLO, MAYA.
HELLO, EMILY.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.214
YOU DIDN'T COME ALL THIS WAY
TO SEE MELISSA, DID YOU?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.282
WHY DON'T WE CONTINUE
THIS OVER COFFEE?

00:48.316 --> 00:49.483
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND NOW.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.085
FINE. HOW 'BOUT TEA?

00:51.119 --> 00:53.621
I DON'T REMEMBER A THING
FROM THE NIGHT ALI DIED.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.824
I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING
WITH THIS.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.561
HERE IS THE SUMMARY PAGE.

01:00.594 --> 01:01.795
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

01:01.829 --> 01:04.098
ALISON WAS BURIED ALIVE.

01:04.132 --> 01:06.367
WHERE'S PAGE 5?
LOOK, HERE'S PAGE ONE...

01:06.400 --> 01:08.269
2, 3, 4...

01:08.302 --> 01:09.570
PAGE 6.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.139
WHERE THE HELL
IS PAGE 5?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.406
DR. SULLIVAN?

01:12.440 --> 01:13.774
CAN YOU GET AHOLD
OF THE OTHER GIRLS

01:13.807 --> 01:15.143
AND COME TO MY OFFICE NOW?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.510
I KNOW WHO "A" IS.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.213
SHE'S NOT HERE.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.414
( cellphones ringing )

01:20.448 --> 01:23.417
"THE DOCTOR IS OUT. 'A.'"

01:36.330 --> 01:40.568
THEY, UH, THEY'VE
BEEN LIKE THIS SINCE
WE BROUGHT 'EM IN HERE.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.404
HAVEN'T SAID A WORD.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.475
YOU KNOW, THERE'S, UH,

01:47.508 --> 01:49.777
THERE'S PROBABLY
A PROMOTION IN
THIS FOR YOU.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.750
YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG.

01:56.784 --> 02:00.454
THEY'RE GUILTY,
AND NOW WE CAN PROVE IT.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.866
DID YOU MISS ME?

02:17.805 --> 02:21.775
THIS DOESN'T JUST
LOOK BAD, IT IS BAD.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.213
HOMICIDE IS A CAPITAL
OFFENSE IN THE STATE
OF PENNSYLVANIA,

02:25.246 --> 02:27.448
AND YOU GIRLS
ARE GOING DOWN.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.386
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

02:32.420 --> 02:34.788
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

02:34.822 --> 02:37.425
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

02:37.458 --> 02:39.793
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

02:39.827 --> 02:41.962
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

02:41.995 --> 02:44.832
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

02:44.865 --> 02:49.670
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

02:51.639 --> 02:54.475
( doorbell rings )

02:54.508 --> 02:56.710
DR. SULLIVAN,
ARE YOU HOME?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.546
YOU'VE REACHED ANNE SULLIVAN.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.781
I'VE BEEN CALLED OUT OF TOWN
 ON A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.783
IF YOU NEED IMMEDIATE
 ATTENTION,

03:02.816 --> 03:04.952
PLEASE SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN
 FOR A REFERRAL.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.620
I GOT THE SAME VOICEMAIL.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.290
YEAH, SHE PROBABLY SENT IT
TO ALL OF HER CLIENTS.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.824
SHE'S NOT HERE.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.927
LOOKS LIKE SHE DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT EITHER.

03:13.961 --> 03:18.198
SHE HASN'T CHECKED HER MAIL
OR PICKED UP HER PAPERS.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.969
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL
THE POLICE.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.938
AND SAY WHAT TO OFFICER
GARRETT WHEN HE STARTS
ASKING QUESTIONS?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.540
HANNA'S RIGHT.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.609
GARRETT, JENNA,
IAN, JASON--

03:28.642 --> 03:32.313
THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED,
AND WE CAN'T TRUST
ANY OF THEM.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.548
LOOK, THE LAST TIME
SOMEBODY THOUGHT THEY
KNEW WHO "A" WAS,

03:34.582 --> 03:36.717
SHE GOT HIT BY A CAR.
SORRY, HANNA.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.752
OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO?

03:38.786 --> 03:40.321
WE GO INTO
TERROR ALERT RED

03:40.354 --> 03:41.689
AND HOPE THAT
OUR PHONES DON'T RING.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.324
( cellphone rings )

03:43.357 --> 03:44.892
THAT DID NOT
JUST HAPPEN!

03:44.925 --> 03:47.728
IT'S MAYA.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.763
LOOK AT YOU,
SUDDENLY ALL HAPPY.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.002
SO, WAS IT, LIKE,
NONSTOP "JUST SAY NO"

03:55.035 --> 03:57.004
AND SUNSET SING-ALONGS?

03:57.037 --> 03:58.572
I WILL ADMIT TO
KNOWING ALL THE WORDS

03:58.606 --> 04:00.741
TO "WHAT A FRIEND
WE HAVE IN JESUS,"

04:00.774 --> 04:03.644
BUT I ALSO MET A LOT
OF COOL PEOPLE THERE.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.012
COOL LIKE THE OSMONDS?

04:05.045 --> 04:07.881
( chuckles )
GO WITH THE GOLD.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.717
AND COOL LIKE YOU
DON'T END UP AT TRUE NORTH

04:09.750 --> 04:11.652
BECAUSE
YOU'RE A CONFORMIST.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.887
YOU KNOW, I HEARD THAT
THEY MAKE YOU LOOK
AT PICTURES...

04:13.921 --> 04:15.923
HANNA, I LOVE YOU,

04:15.956 --> 04:18.024
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO TALK TO MAYA...

04:18.058 --> 04:19.892
ALONE.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.894
OH, THIS IS A DATE!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.497
IT'S NOT A DATE.
IT'S NOT A DATE.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.033
AND I'M
THE CLUELESS GOOBER.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.669
OKAY, LOOK, I'M REALLY
HAPPY THAT YOU'RE BACK,

04:28.702 --> 04:30.904
AND I HOPE THAT WE...

04:30.938 --> 04:32.873
OKAY, ARE THOSE
THIS SEASON?

04:36.076 --> 04:37.811
WE'LL... TALK LATER.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.547
( chuckles )
SURE.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.615
AND I HOPE THE WEDDING
GOES BETTER THAN THE REHEARSAL.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.785
WELL, I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW IT COULD BE ANY WORSE.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.354
( laughing softly )

04:46.387 --> 04:48.356
IT'S SWEET THAT YOU GUYS
ARE GOING WITH HER.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.558
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT TOGETHER.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.826
YOU HAVE GREAT FRIENDS.

04:52.860 --> 04:56.730
I KIND OF THINK THAT'S
WHERE WE NEED TO START AGAIN.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.567
YOU... JUST WANT
TO BE FRIENDS?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.769
NO. I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.839
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED,
AND...

05:05.873 --> 05:09.710
I DON'T KNOW...
THIS EMILY.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.580
I-I THINK YOU'LL LIKE HER.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.715
I KNOW I WILL, BUT...

05:14.748 --> 05:17.551
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
SHE STILL LIKES ME.

05:19.520 --> 05:24.358
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M THRILLED
YOU CALLED ME.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.026
I SHOULD HAVE
CALLED YOU FIRST.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.762
YOU SHOULD'VE.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.998
BUT I FORGIVE YOU.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.707
THANK YOU. I'LL PICK
IT UP IN AN HOUR.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.042
WHAT DID THE MECHANIC SAY?

05:42.075 --> 05:45.045
THE BRAKE FLUID WAS LOW.
WHAT?!

05:45.078 --> 05:46.614
HOW DID THAT EVEN HAPPEN?

05:46.647 --> 05:48.048
YOU TREAT THAT TRUCK
LIKE IT'S YOUR BABY.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.650
THE BRAKE LINE WAS SEVERED.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.420
I PROBABLY BACKED OVER
SOMETHING AT WORK.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.422
YOU WERE JUST LUCKY
YOU WEREN'T ON THE HIGHWAY.

05:55.956 --> 06:00.060
IF WE HAD A REAL BABY,

06:00.093 --> 06:02.496
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE?

06:02.530 --> 06:06.900
I'M PICTURING A NEWBORN
WITH A SIX-PACK.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.469
( chuckles softly )

06:08.502 --> 06:11.539
( laughing )

06:13.874 --> 06:19.012
LOOKS LIKE JASON'S
TAKING DOWN HIS
WINDOW TREATMENTS.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.782
HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME
IN ALISON'S ROOM.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.655
YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE HE LIKES THE VIEW.

06:27.688 --> 06:31.892
SO, YOUR DAD DIDN'T
TELL YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

06:31.925 --> 06:34.828
WHY WOULD YOUR DAD
BE OVER THERE?

06:36.897 --> 06:40.568
LIKE I SAID,
HE JUST WOULDN'T TELL ME.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.673
AND THAT WAS THE END
OF THE CONVERSATION?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.040
YEAH.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.175
SPENCER.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.743
I KNOW YOU.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.712
WHEN YOU WANT ANSWERS,
YOU GET THEM.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.080
YEAH, WELL,
YOU MIGHT KNOW ME,

06:53.113 --> 06:54.715
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
MY DAD,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.450
AND WHEN HE TELLS ME
TO MIND MY OWN BUSINESS,

06:56.484 --> 06:57.818
THAT'S WHAT I DO,

06:57.851 --> 06:59.419
SO CAN YOU JUST
GET OVER IT?

07:02.022 --> 07:04.792
I'M SORRY.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.660
IT'S JUST,
THAT'S WHO HE IS.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.195
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

07:08.228 --> 07:10.798
WELL, I DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.901
I FEEL LIKE WE
ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.678
( dialing )

07:24.712 --> 07:27.515
THE MAILBOX YOU WERE
 TRYING TO REACH IS FULL.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.853
( doorbell rings )

07:38.225 --> 07:39.627
YOU'RE EARLY.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.729
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.731
OKAY, I WANT
TO SEE PICTURES,

07:43.764 --> 07:45.699
I WANT TO HEAR DETAILS,
I WANT TO--

07:45.733 --> 07:48.268
OKAY, I PROMISE,
I WILL RELIVE
THE ENTIRE TRIP,

07:48.301 --> 07:51.839
BUT RIGHT NOW
WHAT I WANT IS FOR
YOU TO COME HERE.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.512
THANK YOU.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.915
FOR WHAT?

08:01.949 --> 08:04.952
FOR BEING HERE.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.887
HANNA, WHAT'S WRONG?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.590
ASK ME WHAT'S RIGHT IF YOU
WANT A SHORTER ANSWER.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.527
I THREW UP
ON ISABEL'S DRESS.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.529
MY DAD HAS NEVER BEEN
MORE MAD AT ME,

08:15.563 --> 08:17.631
AND AFTER TONIGHT,

08:17.665 --> 08:19.700
KATE'S GONNA BE MY
WICKED STEPSISTER
FOR LIFE.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.268
AND WHAT'S EVEN WORSE

08:21.301 --> 08:23.671
IS I HAVE TO WEAR A DRESS
THAT DOESN'T FIT RIGHT.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.606
I CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT BRA,
WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA HAVE
BACK FAT.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.541
YOU COULD BE THE SKINNIEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD AND...!

08:27.575 --> 08:29.076
HANNA, HANNA.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.177
Shh.

08:50.197 --> 08:55.603
IT REMINDS ME OF OLD TIMES
TO SEE YOU LIKE THAT.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.939
I SAW YOUR CAR IN THE LOT,
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO TAKE A COFFEE BREAK.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.842
OH, UH...
ARE YOU WORKING
ON YOUR PAPER?

09:01.875 --> 09:05.012
I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S GETTING PUBLISHED.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.614
THE FIRST TIME'S
OVERWHELMING,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.749
BUT I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.051
WHEN I READ
YOUR POEMS, I REMEMBER

09:11.084 --> 09:13.286
HOW EASY IT WAS FOR ME
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.888
JACKIE, UH...

09:14.922 --> 09:16.924
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.126
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.297
YOU'RE A TOTAL CATCH.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.800
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
REALIZE THAT EARLIER.

09:28.936 --> 09:32.706
BUT I WONDER HOW THINGS
WOULD BE IF WE WERE
BOTH SINGLE.

09:32.740 --> 09:36.944
BUT I'M NOT, SO, UH...

09:36.977 --> 09:39.346
I KNOW. I GET IT.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.348
TO MOVING ON.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.316
TO... TO MOVING ON.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.023
( cell phone vibrates )

09:50.057 --> 09:52.793
( vibrates )

09:54.261 --> 09:56.196
( vibrates )

10:08.341 --> 10:10.243
I WALKED TO THE OUTSIDE,

10:10.277 --> 10:12.279
AND WHEN I CAME BACK
INSIDE, IT WAS HERE.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.981
HERE? LIKE, IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR KITCHEN,

10:14.014 --> 10:15.849
OR HERE ON YOUR PORCH
AND YOU BROUGHT IT INSIDE?

10:15.883 --> 10:17.017
I HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.819
GUYS, I NEVER
TOLD YOU THIS,

10:18.852 --> 10:22.890
BUT DR. SULLIVAN
REALLY HELPED ME.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.692
YEAH, THAT WAS THE REASON
THAT WE TRUSTED HER.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.360
SHE HELPED US ALL.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.362
YOU DON'T THINK
HER EAR'S IN HERE, DO YOU?

10:29.396 --> 10:32.299
OHH!
IT'S A BIG BOX FOR AN EAR.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.415
"YOU HAVE UNTIL
SEVEN P.M. TO SAVE HER.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.719
THESE ARE MY DEMANDS."

10:51.752 --> 10:53.921
DOLLS?!

10:53.954 --> 10:55.222
'KAY...

10:58.191 --> 11:00.994
GUESS THIS IS YOURS.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.000
WAIT.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.971
Tinny Voice:
 MAKE JACKIE GO AWAY.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.275
IS THERE A CREEPIER WORD
THAN "CREEPY"?

11:17.945 --> 11:19.913
WAIT, THIS IS THE PAPER
JACKIE'S GETTING PUBLISHED

11:19.947 --> 11:22.950
ON THEODORE...
GéRICAULT?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.953
HE'S THIS FRENCH PAINTER...
WHO PAINTED.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.789
YEAH, IN A WORD.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.458
BUT "A" ALSO GAVE YOU
THIS FRENCH ARTICLE
ON GéRICAULT,

11:31.491 --> 11:33.927
AND... IT'S IDENTICAL
TO JACKIE'S PAPER.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.063
SHE PLAGIARIZED THIS.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.939
STOP THE WEDDING,

11:56.416 --> 11:59.386
KEEP TOBY SAFE.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.521
OH, MY GOD.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.858
TOBY WAS DRIVING
HIS TRUCK THIS MORNING
AND HIS BRAKES WENT OUT.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.194
THAT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.
THAT WAS "A."

12:11.298 --> 12:13.000
I DIDN'T GET ONE.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.937
YOU'VE BEEN "A's"
TARGET FOR WEEKS, EM.

12:16.970 --> 12:20.040
YEAH. MAYBE
"A's" BORED WITH YOU.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.209
AND I MEAN THAT
AS A GOOD THING.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.278
IF "A" WANTS TO SHUT ME UP,
SHE FOUND A WAY TO DO IT.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.115
I MEAN, WE FINALLY
TELL SOMEONE THE TRUTH,

12:28.148 --> 12:29.983
AND NOW
DR. SULLIVAN'S GONE.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.285
"A" CAN DO THAT TO
ANYONE THAT WE CARE ABOUT.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.325
SO WE DO THESE THINGS,
AND "A" GIVES HER BACK?

12:38.358 --> 12:40.193
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE?

12:40.227 --> 12:44.231
I GET THAT THIS IS A GAME,
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.070
SPENCE.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.940
NO, IT'S BRILLIANT,
ACTUALLY.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.075
"A" IS BEING OUR
ULTIMATE "FRIENEMY,"

12:55.108 --> 12:56.476
FORCING US TO GET
WHAT WE WANT,

12:56.509 --> 12:57.945
BUT KNOWING THAT
WHEN WE DO...

12:57.978 --> 12:59.446
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.248
BELIEVE ME, I REALLY
WANT TO GET RID OF JACKIE,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.150
BUT IF I USE THIS
TO DO IT,

13:03.183 --> 13:05.118
EZRA MAY NEVER FORGIVE ME.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.855
THERE'S A REASON WE CAN'T JUST
GO AROUND TELLING THE TRUTH:

13:07.888 --> 13:09.957
'CAUSE IT COMES BACK
TO BITE YOU, HARD.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.196
Spencer: OKAY.
WE'VE GOT FIVE HOURS

13:16.229 --> 13:19.332
TO OBEY OUR
CHUCKY DOLLS OR...

13:21.434 --> 13:23.003
I SAW "A" PUSH IAN
OFF THAT BELL TOWER,

13:23.036 --> 13:24.872
AND THERE WAS
 NO HESITATION.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.040
SPENCE,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

13:27.074 --> 13:30.077
SHE'S SAYING THAT IT FELT
LIKE IT WAS EASY FOR "A"
TO KILL SOMEONE.

13:30.110 --> 13:34.147
AND I ONLY KNOW ONE WAY
TO KEEP TOBY SAFE,

13:34.181 --> 13:36.950
AND THAT'S TO KEEP HIM
AWAY FROM ME.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.206
OH.

13:59.239 --> 14:03.010
I DIDN'T MAKE A CALL BEFORE.
I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT NOW.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.478
I GOT
THE EXAMINER'S REPORT,

14:05.512 --> 14:08.215
AND IT'S ALSO
MISSING PAGE 5,

14:08.248 --> 14:12.152
SO I CHECKED OUR CASE FILES
IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.254
SIR, THERE'S NO RECORD
OF PAGE 5 ANYWHERE.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.257
WHAT WAS ON THAT PAGE?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.960
IT WAS THE ANALYSIS
OF THE TRACE EVIDENCE

14:19.993 --> 14:21.661
FOUND ON
THE VICTIM'S BODY.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.331
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT EVERY RECORD OF
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

14:24.364 --> 14:26.466
FOUND ON THE DECEASED
IS GONE?!

14:48.655 --> 14:53.493
( weeping )
I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE,
AND I NEED YOU!

15:17.250 --> 15:19.987
LOOKING FOR MR. FITZ?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.288
WRONG FLOOR.

15:51.051 --> 15:54.054
WHO ELSE KNOWS
ABOUT THIS? DOES EZRA?

15:55.188 --> 15:56.423
NO.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.128
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.765
I THINK YOU NEED
TO LEAVE HOLLIS.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.334
OR?

16:13.740 --> 16:16.009
I'M SORRY I HAD TO DO THIS.

16:31.358 --> 16:34.761
( cellphone rings )

16:34.794 --> 16:37.497
( ring )

16:37.530 --> 16:40.233
( ring )

16:40.267 --> 16:43.803
( ring )

16:43.836 --> 16:45.805
( ringing stops )

16:45.838 --> 16:48.641
( sighs )

16:53.680 --> 16:55.515
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN YET?

16:55.548 --> 16:58.685
EM, MY DAD WAS
M.I.A. FOR TWO YEARS,

16:58.718 --> 17:01.054
AND I THOUGHT I'D NEVER
FORGIVE HIM FOR THAT,

17:01.088 --> 17:02.655
BUT I HAVE.

17:02.689 --> 17:07.394
IF I SCREW UP THIS WEDDING,
HE'S GONNA LEAVE AGAIN.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.596
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM
SINCE LAST NIGHT?

17:09.628 --> 17:12.265
HE TALKED TO MY MOM.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.401
ISABEL HAD TO BUY
A NEW DRESS.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.336
( soft knock at door )

17:20.540 --> 17:23.410
I'LL, UM, MEET YOU
AT THE CHURCH, OKAY?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.590
I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.726
I KNOW.

17:39.759 --> 17:43.330
AND I'M SORRY I PUT
THAT MUCH PRESSURE ON YOU
TO MAKE THE TOAST.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.365
THIS IS GONNA BE
AN ADJUSTMENT
FOR EVERYONE,

17:45.398 --> 17:48.768
BUT... I THINK
WE CAN ALL FIND
A WAY TO GET ALONG.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.870
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.206
IT CAN BE,

17:53.240 --> 17:54.574
IF YOU ACCEPT IT.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.844
DAD, ARE YOU REALLY
SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

17:57.877 --> 18:00.780
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
YOU AND MOM AREN'T
PERFECT TOGETHER,

18:00.813 --> 18:05.118
BUT... I DON'T KNOW,
YOU WERE HAVING
SO MUCH FUN HERE.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.654
YOUR MOM'S A LOT
SMARTER THAN I AM,

18:07.687 --> 18:11.524
AND SHE HELPED ME
REALIZE I WAS AVOIDING
MAKING THIS COMMITMENT,

18:11.558 --> 18:14.794
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE
I DON'T LOVE ISABEL.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.398
IT'S JUST, SOMETIMES
WHEN THINGS ARE GOING
REALLY GOOD FOR ME,

18:18.431 --> 18:21.134
I SCREW 'EM UP
BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE CAN.

18:21.168 --> 18:24.404
I KNOW. IT DOESN'T MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE,

18:24.437 --> 18:28.408
BUT IT'S A HABIT
I'M TRYING TO BREAK.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.610
SO YOU REALLY DO
LOVE ISABEL?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.111
SHE MAKES ME HAPPY, KIDDO.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.232
SPENCER.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.234
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

18:54.267 --> 18:58.405
YOU SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT,
BUT YOU'RE NOT TALKING.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.673
IT'S BECAUSE...

19:00.707 --> 19:02.842
I KNOW WHEN YOU HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY...

19:05.245 --> 19:07.747
YOU'LL REALIZE THAT
I'M NOT THE PERSON
YOU THINK I AM.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.750
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.320
I LIED TO YOU THIS MORNING.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.257
MY DAD TOLD ME
A WHOLE LOT MORE

19:17.290 --> 19:18.925
THAN JUST TO MIND
MY OWN BUSINESS.

19:21.294 --> 19:25.498
I-I FEEL LIKE
WE'VE BEEN IN THIS
TOGETHER WITH YOUR FAMILY,

19:25.532 --> 19:27.634
AND WITH JASON TOO.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.968
YEAH.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.539
SO WHAT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU LIED.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.674
THERE'S...

19:34.707 --> 19:36.709
THERE'S SO MUCH
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.181
AND I CAN NEVER TELL YOU.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.920
DON'T YOU TRUST ME.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.465
I THOUGHT WE
FELT THE SAME WAY
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.269
LOOK, I FOUND A WAY
TO SURVIVE MY SECRETS,

20:02.302 --> 20:04.737
BUT EVERYBODY THAT
I CARE ABOUT GETS HURT.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.407
AND YOU DESERVE TO BE
WITH SOMEBODY WHO CAN
BE HONEST WITH YOU,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.342
SO, I'M SORRY.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.910
SPENCER.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.545
SPENCER.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.846
WAIT!

20:19.786 --> 20:22.255
( gasping and sobbing )

20:40.072 --> 20:43.976
( sobbing )

20:57.857 --> 20:59.592
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.893
THANKS.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.564
SO, HOW DID IT GO?

21:04.597 --> 21:07.567
MIKE SEEMS RELIEVED,

21:07.600 --> 21:10.703
AND HIS THERAPIST SAID
HE WAS REALLY OPEN
TO TALKING.

21:10.737 --> 21:11.838
GOOD.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.842
I'M SORRY
I ASKED YOU TO LIE.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.346
YOU KNOW I DO TRY
TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT,

21:19.379 --> 21:22.749
AND SOMETIMES
I JUST GET IT WRONG.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.985
TRUST ME, I UNDERSTAND.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.455
MIKE WAS STARVING,

21:28.488 --> 21:30.923
SO DAD TOOK HIM
TO PAPA'S PIZZA.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.526
( laughing )
 THAT SOUNDS LIKE MIKE.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.664
SO I'M GOING TO GO TAKE
A LONG, HOT BATH

21:37.697 --> 21:41.634
AND PRETEND FOR ONE
HOUR THAT I'M THE
PERFECT PARENT.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.603
MOM.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.307
WE ALL GET IT WRONG
SOMETIMES.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.547
( doorbell rings )

21:54.581 --> 21:57.850
OH, I GOT IT.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.419
( ring )

22:03.490 --> 22:05.525
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:05.558 --> 22:07.026
FINISHING WHAT YOU STARTED.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.600
MY MOM'S RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.568
SCARY, ISN'T IT,
PLAYING WITH FIRE.

22:15.602 --> 22:16.903
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.105
I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE
WHEN I LET HIM GO.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.708
WELL, YOU'RE MAKING
AN EVEN BIGGER MISTAKE
BEING HERE RIGHT NOW.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.109
THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE IT.

22:23.142 --> 22:25.111
YOU AND I
ARE SIMILAR, ARIA.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.779
I GUESS THAT MEANS
EZRA HAS A TYPE.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.382
NO, I REALLY DON'T SEE
ANY RESEMBLANCE.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.384
ACTUALLY,
YOU'RE A LOT LIKE ME.

22:31.418 --> 22:33.853
WE'RE BOTH WILLING
TO DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO KEEP HIM.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.422
YOU DON'T HAVE HIM
TO KEEP.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.457
THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.

22:37.490 --> 22:40.927
I'M NOT LEAVING HOLLIS,
BUT YOU ARE LEAVING EZRA,

22:40.960 --> 22:42.929
AND IF YOU MENTION
THIS CONVERSATION

22:42.962 --> 22:46.733
OR MY RESEARCH
MATERIAL TO ANYONE...

22:46.766 --> 22:48.134
I SUPPOSE
EZRA'S YOUNG ENOUGH

22:48.167 --> 22:50.903
TO START OVER AGAIN
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

22:50.937 --> 22:53.039
BUT THE FALLOUT OF
A STUDENT/TEACHER AFFAIR

22:53.072 --> 22:55.675
HAS GOT TO BE A BITCH.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.580
YOU KNOW THAT
THAT WOULD HURT HIM
WAY MORE THAN ME.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.182
I DON'T
WANT TO HURT HIM...

23:03.215 --> 23:04.851
BUT I WILL IF I HAVE TO.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.622
( giggles )
CUTE DRESS.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.574
PREPARE TO MAKE
 A RIGHT TURN.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.809
WHAT'S WEIRD.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.911
MAKE AN IMMEDIATE RIGHT TURN.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.186
( car horn blows sharply )

23:40.219 --> 23:42.755
( Emily sighs )

23:54.501 --> 23:58.037
I'M TAKING YOU TO HER.
 GO ALONE.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.872
RIGHT TURN, PLEASE.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.742
( car horn blows sharply )

24:07.246 --> 24:09.215
THAT LED AUTHORITIES
TO THE SUSPECTS,

24:09.248 --> 24:11.551
BUT THAT'S ALL I CAN
GIVE YOU RIGHT NOW.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.553
( overlapping questions )

24:13.586 --> 24:15.087
OKAY, OKAY,
COME, LET'S GO.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.256
OFFICER, CAN YOU
TELL US WHAT THEY
WERE TRYING TO HIDE?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.158
OFFICER, WAS IT A BODY?

24:19.191 --> 24:20.760
HEY, I SAID MOVE.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.625
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.627
I WAS JUST THINKING
OF THE EVENING

24:54.661 --> 24:56.963
YOU CAUGHT ME
SNEAKING A SMOKE.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.832
YEAH.
YOU LOOKED STUNNING...

24:59.866 --> 25:03.202
AND THIS IS HISTORY
REPEATING ITSELF.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.805
THANK YOU.

25:05.838 --> 25:09.275
NOT FOR THE COMPLIMENT,
BUT FOR THE RIDE HOME

25:09.308 --> 25:11.811
AND LISTENING TO ME.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.946
I REALLY DON'T EVER
LET MYSELF CRY IN
FRONT OF ANYBODY,

25:13.980 --> 25:16.549
BUT YOU MADE IT
REALLY EASY.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.852
YEAH, I OFTEN HAVE
THAT EFFECT ON WOMEN.

25:21.654 --> 25:24.090
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
KNOWN A GUY WHO
CARRIED A HANKY,

25:24.123 --> 25:26.092
SO... SO I DON'T...

25:26.125 --> 25:28.561
REALLY KNOW WHAT
THE PROTOCOL IS.

25:28.595 --> 25:31.998
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
WANT ME TO WASH IT
FIRST OR JUST...

25:34.000 --> 25:36.836
MAYBE YOU TALKED
YOURSELF OUT OF THE
CARPENTER TOO SOON.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.905
NONE OF US
ARE PERFECT, SPENCER.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.740
WE ALL COME WITH BAGGAGE.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.275
YEAH, WELL,
THE CARPENTER HAS A NAME,

25:43.309 --> 25:45.745
AND HE WOULD
NEED A FORKLIFT

25:45.778 --> 25:49.048
TO MANEUVER
THROUGH MY TONNAGE
OF EMOTIONAL DEBRIS.

25:49.081 --> 25:52.218
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
CERTIFIED TO OPERATE
ONE OF THOSE.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.021
NO, I CAN'T IMAGINE
YOU OPERATING

25:55.054 --> 25:57.189
ANY SORT
OF HEAVY MACHINERY.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.758
YEAH, ME NEITHER.
I MADE THAT UP.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.660
BUT I DID
GET YOU TO SMILE.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.132
I REALLY NEED TO GO.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.605
WHOA. HERE.
THANKS.

26:17.109 --> 26:21.213
I KNOW THIS IS INCREDIBLY
INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO SAY,

26:21.247 --> 26:23.983
BUT I'M
DESPERATE TO KISS YOU.

26:24.016 --> 26:27.253
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.755
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.002
I'M SORRY, BUT I'VE BEEN
DYING TO DO THAT.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.105
YOU HAVE TERRIBLE TIMING.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.307
AMONGST OTHER THINGS.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.342
( church bell peals )

26:56.048 --> 26:58.718
HANNA SAID THAT EMILY
LEFT BEFORE SHE DID.

26:58.751 --> 27:01.353
EM, WHERE ARE YOU?

27:05.792 --> 27:07.359
I'M WORRIED, SPENCE.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.861
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.774
THEY REALLY DO LOOK HAPPY.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.410
TRY TO CONTAIN
YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.246
WHY SO GLUM, HANNA?

27:27.279 --> 27:28.881
FEELING A LITTLE HUNG?

27:30.817 --> 27:33.753
( cellphone rings )
I THINK YOUR PURSE
IS RINGING.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.992
THAT'S A VERY
HANDSOME SUIT.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.995
AND THAT IS
A VERY PRETTY DRESS.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.200
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
IT GIVES YOU BACK FAT.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.420
YOU HAVE ARRIVED
 AT YOUR DESTINATION.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.937
LOVE ONE ANOTHER,
BUT NOT MAKE A BOND OF LOVE.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.807
LET IT BE AS A MOVING SEA

28:27.840 --> 28:30.476
BETWEEN THE SHORES
OF YOUR SOULS.

28:30.509 --> 28:34.346
FILL EACH OTHER'S CUP,
BUT DRINK NOT FROM ONE CUP.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.215
GIVE ONE ANOTHER
OF YOUR BREAD...

28:36.248 --> 28:39.318
( mouthing silently )
...BUT EAT NOT
FROM THE SAME LOAF.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.788
SING AND DANCE TOGETHER
AND BE JOYOUS,

28:41.821 --> 28:44.356
BUT LET EACH ONE OF YOU
BE ALONE,

28:44.390 --> 28:47.126
EVEN AS THE...
ISABEL?

28:50.496 --> 28:54.100
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

29:02.308 --> 29:05.244
UH, HANNA,
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT CAN WAIT.

29:05.277 --> 29:09.015
UM, NO, IT CAN'T, DAD.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.022
UH. AHEM.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.357
LET'S GO INTO THE RECTORY.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.170
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

29:34.173 --> 29:36.809
I think Hanna's about
to need a getaway car.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.244
Yeah. Let's go.

29:47.319 --> 29:51.523
WHEN MY DAD
CAME BACK TO ROSEWOOD,

29:51.557 --> 29:54.994
HE HOOKED UP WITH
MY MOM, AND, UM...

29:55.027 --> 29:57.997
AND "HOOKED UP" MEANS
THAT THEY SLEPT TOGETHER.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.599
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.035
IS THIS... TRUE?

30:17.116 --> 30:18.250
I'M SORRY.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.963
( cellphone rings )

30:30.997 --> 30:33.599
( ring )

30:42.909 --> 30:44.176
DR. SULLIVAN?

30:58.557 --> 31:00.993
( car engine running )

31:24.516 --> 31:27.253
NO, NO, NO!

31:27.286 --> 31:29.255
HELLO!

31:29.288 --> 31:30.957
LET ME OUT!

31:33.059 --> 31:35.261
SOMEBODY LET ME OUT!

31:35.294 --> 31:37.563
( indistinct plea )

31:47.106 --> 31:49.141
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
LET ME OUT!

32:04.190 --> 32:07.026
YOU NEED TO GO HOME,
BOY. YOU HAVE NO
REASON TO BE HERE.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.227
I'M NOT YOUR BOY,
AND I'M NOT LEAVING.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.695
YOU ARE IN
NO POSITION TO ARGUE.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.163
SPENCER!

32:11.197 --> 32:13.465
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU CAN'T TELL ME.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.701
I CARE ABOUT YOU!
 I LOVE YOU!

32:15.734 --> 32:18.637
DO YOU HEAR ME?
I LOVE YOU!

32:18.670 --> 32:20.706
SPENCER!

32:20.739 --> 32:22.141
SPENCER!

32:59.278 --> 33:01.013
IT'S OKAY.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.314
YOU'RE WITH ME NOW.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.117
ALISON?

33:05.151 --> 33:08.254
( chuckles softly )
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE
YOU, EMILY.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.422
I THINK I MISS YOU THE MOST.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.660
JUST REST.

33:14.693 --> 33:18.397
IT'S WHAT YOU NEED.
REST.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.171
I NEVER TOLD YOU THIS,
BUT...

33:25.204 --> 33:28.307
YOU WERE ALWAYS
MY FAVORITE.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.742
NOBODY LOVED ME
AS MUCH AS YOU DID.

33:30.776 --> 33:34.446
IS THIS WHAT DYING IS?

33:34.480 --> 33:37.449
THAT BITCH THINKS
THIS IS WHAT YOU
REALLY WANT--

33:37.483 --> 33:40.586
TO BE COMPLETELY
FREE OF "A."

33:40.619 --> 33:43.189
DO YOU KNOW WHO "A" IS?

33:43.222 --> 33:45.524
OF COURSE I DO.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.093
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.330
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.132
WHY?

33:54.300 --> 33:56.402
BECAUSE TWO CAN
ONLY KEEP A SECRET

33:56.435 --> 33:58.370
IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.144
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
WHAT YOU WANT, EMILY.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.514
YOU CAN STAY HERE...

34:08.547 --> 34:11.183
OR YOU CAN COME WITH ME.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.422
SWEET EMILY.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.702
Hanna: EMILY!

34:30.735 --> 34:32.138
EMILY!

34:32.170 --> 34:33.539
EM, ARE YOU OKAY?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.507
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:39.844 --> 34:41.380
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.320
SHE WAS HERE.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.588
DID YOU SEE DR. SULLIVAN?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.429
I SAW ALISON.

35:10.376 --> 35:13.845
( door opens )
Aria:
EM. ARE YOU OKAY?

35:15.247 --> 35:17.216
I haven't said
a word to anyone.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.318
They're... watching us.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.155
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

35:24.390 --> 35:28.160
HE GAVE ME SOME OXYGEN.
I'M FINE.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.696
I WANT
 TO SEE MY DAUGHTER,

35:30.729 --> 35:32.464
AND I WANT
TO SEE HER NOW.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.500
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT I HAVE TO WAIT FOR
THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

35:34.533 --> 35:37.403
WELL, THEY'RE IN CUSTODY,
BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN BOOKED.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.538
WELL, YEAH,
I UNDERSTAND, BUT...

35:39.571 --> 35:41.807
I HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.941
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.510
DON'T.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.512
YOU NEED TO STAY
AWAY FROM THIS.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.814
I THINK MY SISTER
WOULD WANT ME HERE.

35:48.847 --> 35:51.683
LOOK...

35:51.717 --> 35:53.585
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

35:53.619 --> 35:55.421
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

35:55.454 --> 35:57.556
I DID THINGS TO
PROTECT YOU THAT YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.425
MY MOTHER TOLD ME
ABOUT THE WILL, OKAY?

35:59.458 --> 36:01.427
AND YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.396
I DIDN'T KILL ALI.
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU DID.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.236
( indistinct )

36:10.269 --> 36:12.238
JASON, I HAVE
WATCHED YOU GROW UP.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.240
I'VE SEEN WHAT
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH,

36:14.273 --> 36:15.307
AND I WAS HONEST
WITH YOU LAST NIGHT

36:15.341 --> 36:17.243
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD HELP.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.611
NO, YOU TOLD ME
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
GIVE YOU A CHOICE.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.248
WHY DO YOU THINK
I BOUGHT THAT HOUSE, HUH?

36:22.281 --> 36:23.982
I KNEW WHAT I'D FIND.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.951
ALI WAS GREAT
AT KEEPING SECRETS,

36:25.984 --> 36:29.788
BUT SHE WAS ALSO GREAT
AT PUNISHING PEOPLE
WITH THE TRUTH.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.725
DOES SHE KNOW?

36:37.563 --> 36:38.764
NO.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.867
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA
FIND OUT TONIGHT.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.311
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!

36:52.344 --> 36:53.845
YOU BLACKED OUT.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.847
MAYBE YOU JUST
DON'T REMEMBER
GETTING THE DOORS OPEN.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.786
THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE.

37:11.863 --> 37:15.434
IT'S A SET OF LATITUDE/
LONGITUDE COORDINATES.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.802
THE TEXT "A" SENT ME
IN THE CHURCH

37:16.835 --> 37:18.804
SAID SHE WAS ABOUT
TO RUN OUT OF AIR.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.808
DID "A" BURY
DR. SULLIVAN ALIVE?

37:27.479 --> 37:29.315
( crickets chirping )

37:29.348 --> 37:31.483
OKAY, I THINK WE HAVE
TO GO LEFT UP HERE,

37:31.517 --> 37:32.851
AND THEN IT'S NOT
MUCH FARTHER.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.620
"NOT MUCH FARTHER"
IN THESE HEELS

37:34.653 --> 37:37.823
IS LIKE A MARATHON
IN FLATS.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.761
CAN'T DO IT.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.063
HERE.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.500
WAIT. IT SAYS THAT
THIS IS IT. WE'RE HERE.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.436
( indistinct sound )

37:52.771 --> 37:54.840
UH... THERE'S
NOTHING HERE.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.678
Guys.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.515
COULD SHE BE UNDER THERE?

38:03.549 --> 38:05.684
( message indicator
rings )

38:08.420 --> 38:10.389
SHE'S STILL ALIVE,
BUT WE SHOULD START DIGGING!

38:10.422 --> 38:11.390
DR. SULLIVAN!

38:17.729 --> 38:19.665
THERE'S
SOMETHING DOWN THERE!

38:21.066 --> 38:23.669
( distant
helicopter approaches )

38:30.709 --> 38:33.879
OH, MY GOD! HER BOOTS!
THOSE ARE HER BOOTS!

38:33.912 --> 38:35.447
GO! FAST!

38:35.481 --> 38:36.948
( all shrieking
and panting )

38:38.016 --> 38:39.585
COME ON!

38:39.618 --> 38:41.587
( indistinct shrieking )

38:41.620 --> 38:42.954
( helicopter approaching )

38:42.988 --> 38:44.823
DR. SULLIVAN!

38:44.856 --> 38:46.958
WHAT THE--?

38:46.992 --> 38:49.361
( helicopter hovering )

38:50.896 --> 38:53.565
THIS IS THE POLICE.
 STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

38:58.169 --> 38:59.905
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN!

38:59.938 --> 39:03.475
YOU'RE SURROUNDED.
DON'T TRY TO GET AWAY.

39:03.509 --> 39:07.045
"A" SET US UP!

39:07.078 --> 39:09.381
YEAH, BUT FOR WHAT?

39:09.415 --> 39:11.450
THIS IS THE POLICE!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

39:11.483 --> 39:14.085
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THE FOREST.
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.987
WELL, VERONICA'S
IN WITH THEM NOW.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.656
SHE'LL SEE THAT
THEY'RE PROTECTED,

39:17.689 --> 39:19.357
BUT THEY'RE GONNA NEED
A CRIMINAL ATTORNEY.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.495
WHAT'S EZRA DOING HERE?

39:25.731 --> 39:28.467
UH... WHY DON'T YOU
HEAR PETER OUT?

39:28.500 --> 39:30.035
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

39:35.507 --> 39:36.908
ELLA.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.845
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.448
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT I...

39:42.481 --> 39:44.015
STOP.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.017
THIS IS
A VERY SMALL TOWN.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.454
PEOPLE SEE THINGS,
AND THEY TALK.

39:49.955 --> 39:52.958
I ACTUALLY
THOUGHT YOU WERE
AN OUTSTANDING TEACHER.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.597
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.938
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
ONE CHANCE TO WALK
AWAY FROM THIS.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.940
NOT BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT,

40:08.974 --> 40:13.545
BUT BECAUSE THIS IS
THE LAST THING WE NEED
TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW.

40:13.579 --> 40:16.548
AND WHEN YOU GO,
YOU NEED TO KEEP GOING,

40:16.582 --> 40:19.485
BECAUSE IF SPENCER'S
PARENTS FIND OUT ABOUT THIS,

40:19.518 --> 40:21.052
THEY WILL RUIN YOU.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.191
I THOUGHT DETECTIVE WILDEN
WAS FIRED.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.460
HE WAS SUSPENDED
FOR HIS ACTIONS,

40:28.494 --> 40:31.129
BUT HE'S BEEN REINSTATED
AS THE CHIEF OFFICER
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.564
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

40:32.598 --> 40:34.733
HE HAS EVIDENCE TO
BACK UP HIS ALLEGATIONS.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.770
AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT,
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.208
HAS ANYONE
CALLED MY PARENTS?

40:43.241 --> 40:44.943
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.546
( door slams )

40:47.579 --> 40:50.816
WE COULDN'T HAVE COME UP
WITH A BETTER PLAN.

40:50.849 --> 40:54.553
I WISH I COULD SEE
THOSE BITCHES RIGHT NOW.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.755
I'M SORRY THAT THEY
DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE
DOING THIS TO THEM.

40:58.557 --> 41:03.562
ARE YOU READY TO
GIVE UP YOUR CAREER
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT?

41:03.595 --> 41:07.733
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET RID
OF THIS RIDICULOUS UNIFORM.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.869
IT'S NOT SMART FOR ME
TO WALK OUT OF HERE
TONIGHT.

41:10.902 --> 41:15.173
WELL, YOU'RE MUCH MORE
PATIENT THAN I AM.

41:15.206 --> 41:19.945
I'VE BEEN WAITING
MONTHS TO GET INTO
THAT STORAGE ROOM.

41:19.978 --> 41:23.615
I THINK I CAN
WAIT A LITTLE LONGER
TO QUIT THE FORCE.

41:23.649 --> 41:26.017
Are you still
worried about Jason?

41:26.051 --> 41:29.621
YOU KNOW, HE'S FIGURED OUT
THAT HE'S NOT THE ONE
THAT KILLED HER,

41:29.655 --> 41:33.191
BUT HE'S GOT NO IDEA
THAT WE WROTE THAT NOTE.

41:33.224 --> 41:36.094
AND WE'RE GETTING
AWAY WITH IT.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.830
( chuckles )

41:38.864 --> 41:40.766
WHEN ALISON DiLAURENTIS
WAS MURDERED,

41:40.799 --> 41:44.235
SHE WAS HIT SO HARD,
IT MADE AN INDENTATION
TO HER SKULL.

41:46.237 --> 41:49.941
I'VE GIVEN YOU GUYS
SO MANY CHANCES TO
JUST BE HONEST WITH ME.

41:49.975 --> 41:51.777
EVIDENCE DOESN'T LIE.

41:55.981 --> 41:58.817
WE'VE KNOWN ALL ALONG
WHAT THE MURDER WEAPON WAS.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.619
TONIGHT WE CAUGHT
YOU WITH IT.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.267
TAKE THIS HOME.

42:19.270 --> 42:21.239
AND BURN IT.

42:21.272 --> 42:23.975
IS IT PAGE 5?

42:24.009 --> 42:25.711
IT'S OVER, JENNA.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.679
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO LINK US TO THAT NIGHT.

42:30.315 --> 42:33.685
SHE DESERVED
TO DIE LIKE THAT.

42:35.186 --> 42:37.623
( chuckles softly )

42:48.800 --> 42:50.135
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU!

43:02.814 --> 43:04.850
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE ASKED ME TO DO.

43:28.006 --> 43:30.909
HOW YOU DOIN'
TONIGHT, PRETTY EYES?

43:30.942 --> 43:33.078
YOU WANT A PIECE OF PIE?
