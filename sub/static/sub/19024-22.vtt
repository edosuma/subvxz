00:14.120 --> 00:15.633
Nurse Espinoza,

00:15.720 --> 00:19.474
do you by any chance know
what time your 9.30 shift starts?

00:19.560 --> 00:22.757
- 9:30?
- That's what I would've said.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.035
But I had Ted stand out
in the parking lot

00:25.120 --> 00:28.590
and monitor your arrival
times this week. Ted?

00:28.680 --> 00:34.198
9.34, 9.39, 9.41, 9.33 and 9.50.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.999
How is that law degree
working out for you, Ted?

00:37.080 --> 00:39.355
I was going to be a senator.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.000
I haven't perused
the latest nursing contract,

00:42.080 --> 00:45.436
I'm guessing it doesn't say "show up
when you damn well please."

00:45.520 --> 00:48.432
Here's an idea. What say
you stop showing up altogether

00:48.520 --> 00:50.954
and we'll replace you
with a giant time clock?

00:51.040 --> 00:52.359
If we ever miss you,

00:52.440 --> 00:55.000
we'll just have a Bob Kelso
cuckoo bird pop out

00:55.080 --> 00:59.392
every few minutes and say,
"I've never satisfied a woman."

01:00.880 --> 01:02.074
Come on, Ted.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.958
Dr Cox didn't know he was
the father of Jordan's baby,

01:05.040 --> 01:07.031
but they were getting along better.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.475
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.955
As for us, it was
the end of our second year,

01:15.040 --> 01:17.315
and each day
had begun to feel the same.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.911
After a while, your residency
boils down to just a few things.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.797
Paperwork.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.792
The three prescriptions
every patient gets.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.677
Acetaminophen for her headache,

01:33.760 --> 01:36.558
Restoril so she'll sleep,
and Colace so she'll poop.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.631
Paperwork.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.675
Mind-numbing monotony.

01:41.760 --> 01:44.638
And, of course, paperwork.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.428
As for the patients...

01:54.680 --> 01:56.875
Look, because it's diabetes-related,

01:56.960 --> 01:59.838
the pain in your foot
isn't responding to pain killers.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.229
I'd like to try
an anti-seizure medication

02:02.320 --> 02:04.117
before we consider amputation.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.998
Good, because I have
an audition for Stomp tomorrow.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.991
Look, just cut
the damn thing off, will ya?

02:10.080 --> 02:12.469
That's why I'm so psyched
our college buddy,

02:12.560 --> 02:14.039
Spence, was coming to town.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.031
- Jill Anderson.
- Yes.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.111
- No.
- Monica Meyer.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.236
- Yeah.
- Yes.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.276
I don't think
it's appropriate for us

02:22.360 --> 02:24.749
to be rehashing
our college sexual conquests

02:24.840 --> 02:26.592
with Carla in the other room.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.477
- Leslie Stevens.
- Yes!

02:28.560 --> 02:31.154
On a pile of coats
with hundreds of people around.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.798
What a whore!

02:32.880 --> 02:35.110
Who else?
Who else did you bang?

02:35.200 --> 02:38.510
Carla, college wasn't
all sex and coats.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.273
Spence here got me through
a lot of hard times.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.630
Why don't you just
mousse the crap out of it?

02:45.720 --> 02:47.995
Straight up.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.069
Yes.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.551
- My life changed that day.
- Man, that was a long time ago.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.269
Now you two are engaged,
I'm in town because two frat brothers

02:58.360 --> 02:59.793
are getting married.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.917
- A double wedding?
- No.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.952
Good for the boys.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.396
The point is, we've really grown up.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.271
That's good, good sauce.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.590
Check it out.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.272
Free pitcher.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.273
What I've got you on
is D-five half normal saline

03:26.360 --> 03:28.635
with 20 KCL
at 1 00ccs an hour.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.870
The Cadillac of all hangover cures.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.633
- It feels warm in my tummy.
- Good morning, angels.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.188
Did you have one too many
Daiquiris last night?

03:36.280 --> 03:39.670
- Spence, this is Dr Cox and...
- Don't bother. Don't care.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.479
He's the scary man
you told me about last night.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.074
- Hey, congratulations.
- For what, jackass?

03:45.160 --> 03:48.709
- You just had a baby.
- No, she just had a baby.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.678
But you said it was his.
And you said something else.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.877
- That he didn't know it yet.
- That's exactly right.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.078
Holy crap.
Run away. Run away. Run away.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.793
OK, he hasn't said a word
in over ten minutes.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.836
The hell with it. I'm going in.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.035
Dr Cox...

04:21.120 --> 04:23.998
If the next words aren't
"See you." the third will be,

04:24.080 --> 04:26.640
"My crotch,
you've punched me in the crotch."

04:26.720 --> 04:28.119
See you.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.269
- How about that guy?
- Yeah.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.429
- That guy?
- Yeah.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.511
Maybe it would be easier
if I told you

04:36.600 --> 04:38.636
whose butt I haven't
had my fingers in.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.711
That's a perk you never hear about.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.234
You guys landed your dream jobs, huh?

04:43.320 --> 04:45.072
Dream job.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.359
Hey, man, how am I supposed
to finish this memo?

05:01.440 --> 05:03.795
I don't know.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.430
Do you have
any interesting patients?

05:08.520 --> 05:11.592
Mr Weinberg has dementia
but still enjoys his ronking.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.557
- What's ronking?
- Ronk!

05:13.640 --> 05:16.359
- lnteresting.
- Hey, sweetness.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.796
- Ronk.
- When do people yell "stat"?

05:19.880 --> 05:22.792
Kinda never. Bambi, rounds.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.634
- Dammit.
- Run, Johnny, run.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.077
- Trying to add a little drama.
- I felt it.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.312
This is not a good day
to be late.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.231
Every year,
Kelso picks a resident

05:37.320 --> 05:39.470
to ride mercilessly
until they crumble.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.075
The key is to jump on any easy
question and impress him early.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.628
- Right, shall we get started?
- Y es!

05:45.720 --> 05:49.030
- Excuse me?
- Should we get started? Yes.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.792
Wow...

05:50.880 --> 05:54.475
Dr Reid, do an ABG
on bed four without waking him.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.632
Dr... Young Asian Fellow,

05:57.720 --> 05:59.790
bed seven needs a central line.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.758
Dr Murphy and Dr Eager Beaver,
step forward.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.957
This is it. Last man standing.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.713
What are the four
differential diagnoses

06:08.800 --> 06:11.155
of the persistent ST elevation
on any EKG?

06:11.240 --> 06:12.514
- Dorian.
- lschemia.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.749
- Murphy.
- Aneurysm.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.989
- Dorian.
- Pericarditis.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.071
- Murphy.
- Pass.

06:19.080 --> 06:23.392
Ah, Doug. At least you're going
to a more chocolaty place.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.516
Dr Murphy.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.238
Ronk!

06:28.320 --> 06:32.279
Dr Reid! A moment, please.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.798
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.270
Every time I turn around,
Dr Kelso's riding me.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.557
I've got next. What's up?

06:43.640 --> 06:46.108
No one? Self-five.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.111
For the big dog.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.716
Look, Elliot,
I've seen this before.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.270
Kelso worries he's not scary,
so he picks somebody to be his bitch.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.157
Who he picks is totally random.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.549
Unless you throw
a needle in his face.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.996
OK, I didn't tell you the kid
was yours and you're upset.

07:04.080 --> 07:08.517
I get it. But you seem to be
making a really big deal out of this.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.068
Is there something else
that's bothering you?

07:11.160 --> 07:13.435
It's mostly just the kid thing.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.114
I didn't want you
to feel pressured to be with me.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.236
I didn't want you
to feel manipulated.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.038
I am so, so sorry,

07:20.120 --> 07:23.157
but no matter what you say,
you don't have a leg to stand on.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.231
I don't know about that, Perry.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.312
Sounds like she's trying
to protect your relationship.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.119
Some mothers say the only way
to get a guy to marry you

07:31.200 --> 07:33.350
- is by using pregnancy as a trap.
- What?

07:33.440 --> 07:35.431
Stupid mothers
who got even meaner

07:35.520 --> 07:37.476
when they stopped drinking.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.038
Morning.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.714
- I make more than you do.
- What?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.758
I saw your paycheck.
I make more than you do.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.832
- Quite a bit more.
- You couldn't have seen it.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.354
No way I could access
the personnel files.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.873
Just impossible.

07:54.800 --> 07:59.316
By the way, 987654320.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.756
- My Social Security number.
- No. That's your PlN number.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.674
- No, my PlN number is 3674.
- Bingo.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.671
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

08:11.760 --> 08:13.671
to have a janitor
make more than you?

08:13.760 --> 08:16.558
Johnny. Investment banker.
So, no.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.076
Why, Christopher?

08:20.160 --> 08:21.559
I've saved up 500 bucks.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.870
Where would you put that
if you were me?

08:23.960 --> 08:25.518
A wallet, a money clip.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.990
You could get Schmitty and Dan
a wedding gift. Dan wants a ferret.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.310
- Ferrets are nice.
- They're mean.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.994
Let's go do something
special tonight. My treat.

08:34.080 --> 08:38.039
We gotta kinda lay low tonight.
We're on backup call.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.078
See, now, this is
the proper way to lay low.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.594
I mean, honestly,
does it get any better?

08:43.679 --> 08:45.955
No, it does not.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.070
Why do you keep looking at me
like that?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.071
People.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.349
Ed, did you turn on
the jets in the hot tub?

09:03.440 --> 09:06.750
- No.
- It's too hot on my eyes!

09:09.920 --> 09:12.514
Those sutures look awful,
don't you think, Ted?

09:12.600 --> 09:15.956
I don't know, sir. Yes? No?
I'm barely here.

09:16.040 --> 09:20.033
I know what you're doing, sir,
the whole keep-us-scared thing.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.795
- I'm OK with it.
- Dr Reid.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.077
Even if you hadn't
just missed blinding me earlier,

09:28.160 --> 09:30.196
I still would've picked you
to crap on.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.556
You're easily startled,
you're constantly overwhelmed.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.959
While you work hard,

09:35.040 --> 09:38.032
you still struggle to break
into the middle of the pack.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.716
I chose you because I am hoping
that you will ask yourself,

09:42.800 --> 09:46.873
really ask yourself, if there
isn't some other profession

09:46.960 --> 09:49.269
you might be better suited for.

09:49.360 --> 09:54.753
In the meantime, be a doll
and re-suture that wound.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.317
Wanna get a beer later?

10:04.120 --> 10:06.031
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.192
And while we're coming
completely clean, Perry,

10:09.280 --> 10:12.431
I'm not the girl they're
singing about in My Sharona.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.999
Her name's Sharona.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.390
- You're making jokes?
- I just want this to be OK.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.994
Don't get me wrong.
I wanna be with the kid.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.275
I'm damn sure gonna
be with the kid.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.430
But as far as you and I go...

10:25.760 --> 10:28.558
...I just don't see us working out.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.119
Nothing like cold beers
in a Jacuzzi. Am I right, Ed?

10:43.200 --> 10:47.273
Some days I sit out here for hours,
downing cold one after cold one.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.669
What do you do
when you have to pee?

10:49.760 --> 10:54.231
- So you boys are doctors, huh?
- OK, whoa, Frannie.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.833
That was my ass.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.596
- You guys have to go to work?
- No, it's just a stupid intern.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.877
The only way we have to go in
is if there was some catastrophe.

11:03.960 --> 11:07.953
In breaking news, there's been a
multiple car pile-up on the throughway.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.833
Plus, the two guys on call

11:10.920 --> 11:13.514
would have to be
simultaneously incapacitated.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.994
This is my chance to shine.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.033
What's up, chica? Whoa!

11:20.120 --> 11:21.997
Oh, God!

11:24.040 --> 11:27.635
Part of being a doctor is learning
to deal with the unexpected.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.238
Whether it's someone
who won't take no for an answer.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.073
I've decided not to accept
the being-dumped thing.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.549
I'm gonna hang around
until you forgive me.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.831
Or being shaken
to your very core.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.477
Sometimes it's just having to work
in wet grundies.

11:46.560 --> 11:50.951
Hey, Betty, Wilma. What the hell?
You're only 40 minutes late.

11:51.040 --> 11:55.477
- Do I smell beer?
- We had a few.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.233
Newsflash: you can't drink
and then come to work.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.914
- You're not airline pilots.
- Look, Dr Cox...

12:01.000 --> 12:04.276
No, you look. If someone had
asked me just this morning,

12:04.360 --> 12:06.954
is there any way that
I could have any less respect

12:07.040 --> 12:10.430
for you two geniuses, I would
have said, that's not possible.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.432
Lo and behold, you pulled it off.
Congratulations.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.159
The only problem is
I'm fresh out of blue ribbons,

12:16.240 --> 12:17.958
so instead you'll have to settle

12:18.040 --> 12:20.600
for a lifetime supply
of my foot up your ass.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.594
Go home.
You're not fit to work tonight.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.355
Great speech.
You guys are in trouble.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.829
Wait up, I've got my heels on.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.358
After what happened, I was
in no mood to be messed with.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.431
Hey, Food Stamps.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.758
Little anonymous donation

12:43.840 --> 12:47.150
from a guy who makes a little
more scratch than you.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.754
You know what?
At least what I do matters. OK?

12:49.840 --> 12:52.593
You're cleaning the same spot
you were this morning.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.478
The smart money says
you'll be cleaning it tomorrow.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.152
Why don't I just come by then,

12:57.240 --> 12:59.879
and you can tell me
how what you do day after day

12:59.960 --> 13:03.316
makes even the slightest bit
of difference in this world?

13:04.960 --> 13:07.394
Too mean.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.189
I don't care if I hurt his feelings,
I got absolutely crushed tonight.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.431
Turk and I both knew
who was responsible for all this.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.679
Crockett.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.557
Tubbs.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.558
When do we eat?

13:23.640 --> 13:27.394
Jordan, could you just give me
ten seconds to myself here?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.479
No.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.437
You know,
you are being very immature

13:33.520 --> 13:35.670
and, oh, my God, is that guy on fire?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.760
Dr Cox,
I'm so glad you're here.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.956
From one hell to another.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.076
Dr Kelso's been torturing me lately.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.720
I thought I could handle it.
I've come a long way.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.155
I was afraid of you,
and now I can talk to you,

13:53.240 --> 13:56.198
Iike how your hair's
been looking springy lately,

13:56.280 --> 13:58.953
not like the season,
like the inside of a mattress.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.679
I don't have any clue
what you mean.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.231
Dr Kelso's starting to get to me,

14:08.320 --> 14:10.356
and I don't think
I can take it anymore.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.274
Sorry, kid, but I'm dealing
with my own stuff right now.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.828
Thanks a lot...really.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.595
Howdy, Mop-Top.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.871
Oh, God.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.315
Man, why'd you even show up
this weekend?

14:29.400 --> 14:32.949
What are you talking about?
I introduced Schmitty and Dan.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.554
OK, I didn't really
introduce them.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.269
I'm the one who accidentally
saw them under the foosball table.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.833
Oh, Schmitty.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.433
Typical Spence.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.193
You just blow into town
and get us into trouble.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.555
What?
I made you guys go out tonight?

14:48.640 --> 14:51.029
Hey, I have a presentation
on Thursday.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.588
Ask me if I'll go out
drinking Wednesday night.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.671
- You wanna go out...?
- Sorry.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.115
I can't, I have a presentation.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.794
The truth is, you've been
complaining about work

15:00.880 --> 15:04.270
since the second I got here,
dying for an excuse to blow it off.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.318
So maybe you should stop being
all mad at me when, really,

15:07.400 --> 15:10.392
you're just pissed
because you hate your jobs.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.395
Every time I turn around,
Kelso's there.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.471
Ted, he's trying to break my spirit.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.154
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.389
I'm sorry. Of course you do.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.552
Dr Reid, I'm afraid
that nothing you've described

15:26.640 --> 15:28.198
constitutes harassment.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.271
Swing and a miss, eh, Dr Reid?

15:30.360 --> 15:33.193
The next time you decide
to make a stink over nothing,

15:33.280 --> 15:35.953
you should see a lawyer
who didn't need five tries

15:36.040 --> 15:37.598
to pass the bar exam.

15:37.680 --> 15:42.959
I have stress-induced dyslexia
and you know that, Dr Oslek.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.551
- Why are you doing this?
- I'll tell you why, Perry.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.200
We've been dancing the same
dance for years now.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.918
One gets angry and walks away,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.195
the other's too stubborn
to go after them.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.477
Before you know it, you sleep
with some pharmaceutical rep,

15:58.560 --> 16:01.358
I'm convincing my mom
that the thing in my suitcase

16:01.440 --> 16:04.398
is a giant electric melon-baller.
Guess what?

16:04.480 --> 16:07.677
Things are different now.
We have a kid together.

16:07.760 --> 16:11.389
I'm not going home until you promise
you're coming with me.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.513
You go home.
I'll meet you there later.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.192
Bring dinner.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.034
You're a father.
Can you believe it?

16:33.080 --> 16:34.308
Nope.

16:37.360 --> 16:41.148
I didn't get a lot of sleep thinking
about what Spence had said.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.950
Look, I'm sorry I was
such a jerk yesterday. OK?

16:47.040 --> 16:50.430
Come on, look at this floor.
You could practically eat off of it.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.118
- Would you?
- Would I what?

16:53.200 --> 16:54.952
Would you eat off the floor?

16:58.040 --> 17:00.759
As I bent down to eat
that peppered floor turkey,

17:00.840 --> 17:03.195
unaware that the cleanser
the janitor uses

17:03.280 --> 17:07.637
is an extremely potent diuretic,
I realised something.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.075
The reason we 're doctors
is because we have

17:10.160 --> 17:12.151
an innate desire to help people.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.231
That was disgusting.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.912
You have to have that desire,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.036
because at the end
of your second year,

17:21.119 --> 17:24.430
it's impossible to see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.714
So it becomes
about perseverance.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.398
And fortitude.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.991
And sacrifice.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.196
Sorry you guys
can't make the wedding.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.679
Give them a big kiss for us.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.479
T ell them the ferret
only eats fresh vegetables.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.551
I'm gonna miss you guys.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.591
- I'll see ya later.
- Later, dude.

17:53.040 --> 17:56.077
Really, all you can hope for
is an occasional thank-you.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.071
I'm so glad the medication worked.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.232
I'm supposed to be happy
cos somebody did something right?

18:01.320 --> 18:02.469
You're welcome.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.755
Nice call on the anti-seizure medicine.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.833
I'm starting to think you may not be
the worst resident that ever lived.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.795
- How cool was that?
- Shut up.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.996
You shut up.
You're an angry man.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.032
Sorry I didn't tell you about
the "It's your baby" thing.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.190
We'll probably talk
about that later.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.192
- I wasn't even mad at Jordan.
- No?

18:26.280 --> 18:27.759
I was scared.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.118
I was freaking out, cos I'm confident
that I'll be a horrible father.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.792
You? Come on.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.269
You're gonna be a very scary...
I mean, great.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.998
You're gonna be a great father.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.277
Last night, you totally kicked
our asses cos we deserved it.

18:41.360 --> 18:44.750
Remember you told me I wasn't
the worst resident that ever lived?

18:44.840 --> 18:46.034
Eight seconds ago?

18:46.120 --> 18:48.475
You have no idea how
much that meant to me.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.597
I said, I think you may not
be the worst resident ever,

18:51.680 --> 18:55.195
but I can't be sure of stuff like that.
I haven't done the legwork.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.236
You're always there
when we need you.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.709
I think you have
this fathering thing down.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.791
Why am I not leaving, Dr Reid?

19:01.880 --> 19:03.836
I don't want
to miss you breaking down

19:03.920 --> 19:05.717
and weeping
in front of everyone.

19:05.800 --> 19:10.920
Here it comes. Great big tears.
Great big crocodile tears.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.993
If she was your daughter,
you'd totally know how to handle it.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.917
My God, you're right.

19:26.240 --> 19:29.516
- You're doing fine, Barbie.
- Thank you.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.875
Everybody have a good one.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.030
I'm going home to see my son.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.996
Excuse me there, Bobbo.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.675
Right in the nose. Yeah.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.951
That may come up tomorrow.
