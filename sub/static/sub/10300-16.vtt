01:22.440 --> 01:26.433
Yo, Roxanne, Grandmaster B here.

01:26.880 --> 01:31.396
That's with a big G, a big B
and a real big... Well...

01:33.000 --> 01:35.355
You'll just have to come over
and see for yourself.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.788
Wait... Wait, don't hang up.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.831
Come on, it's my 18th birthday.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.508
Maybe we could go out
and get a soda.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.994
No, huh?

01:43.200 --> 01:47.591
Well, then, I guess a non-binding
sexual thing will be out of the question?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.558
Hello?

01:52.440 --> 01:53.839
Eighteen years.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.271
Eighteen years of Ioneliness.

01:57.480 --> 02:01.439
Total, desolate,
stark raving Ioneliness.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.199
Well, happy birthday anyhow.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.154
- Thank you.
- Oh, cheer up, Butt-wagger B.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.630
I got you a very special present.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.917
Not this time, One-Size-Fits-AII.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.359
I'm not falling for that again.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.437
Every year you say
you got me a present...

02:22.640 --> 02:25.473
...I get all excited and it turns out
to be something stupid...

02:25.680 --> 02:28.035
...like Clearasil in a drum...

02:28.240 --> 02:31.994
...the book, If You're Lonely And You
Know It, Let's Mak e Hand Shadows...

02:32.480 --> 02:34.994
...and my favourite,
the poster of the Village People...

02:35.200 --> 02:38.112
...with my picture over the face
of the cowboy.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.637
Well, forget it. I'm 18 now
and I will not be fooled again.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.150
Oh, come on now.
I got you a good one this time.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.315
- Really?
- Yes.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.475
Give me, give me.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.035
Oh man, oh man.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.475
Oh, wow, a tape recorder, for me?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.114
Oh, get serious, that's mine.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.629
I made a message
for your answering machine.

02:57.840 --> 03:03.119
Hello, this is Bud Bundy,
also known as Grandmaster Virgin.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.517
You must have dialled
the wrong number...

03:06.720 --> 03:09.109
...because no one ever calls me
on purpose.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.992
If you leave your name and number...

03:11.200 --> 03:15.557
...I'll call you back as soon as I finish
putting the negligee on my dog.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.548
Please hold.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.159
Please.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.668
I know it's a little long...

03:23.880 --> 03:26.792
...but then again we don't need
much room for messages, do we?

03:27.920 --> 03:29.035
Gee, smart, funny...

03:29.240 --> 03:31.834
...and she'll give you back change
for your dollar.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.749
Kel, if you really wanna get me
a present this year...

03:35.960 --> 03:37.393
...just forget it's my birthday.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.556
That's all I want,
for everybody to forget.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.075
Oh, there he is.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.955
My little, little birthday man.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.958
Come on,
give Mommy a birthday hug.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.628
Look at you.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.753
Sixteen and already a heartbreaker.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.677
You're confused, Mom.
He's 18.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.758
It's his pimples that are 16.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.549
- That's it. I'm get...
- Come on, I got some for you.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.752
Now, kids, remember the rules.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.279
No fighting.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.313
Makes all the dust rise up.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.559
Anyway, Bud,
this calls for a big celebration.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.036
- So, what...?
- I don't want another birthday party.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.356
All I want is this girl, Roxanne.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.518
Then that's what you're gonna get.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.677
Is Roxanne Barbie's new friend?

04:30.560 --> 04:33.836
No. Roxanne's a real girl.

04:34.680 --> 04:39.754
What happened to that nice
976-girl he had a crush on?

04:40.520 --> 04:43.239
She won't take his calls anymore.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.633
My poor baby.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.677
Well, maybe this will
take the edge off.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.348
We are throwing you a nice party.

04:50.560 --> 04:55.236
And guess what,
we're renting you a pony.

04:58.680 --> 05:03.390
Bud, you better go out right now
and get yourself a half-gallon hat.

05:03.640 --> 05:07.076
But don't go just yet, there's more.

05:07.280 --> 05:12.070
Do you remember your favourite
TV show, Sticky the Clown?

05:12.960 --> 05:16.111
Mom, I haven't watched Sticky
since I was 12 years old.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.551
Well, a lot's happened
to Sticky since then.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.792
He's out on work release...

05:22.000 --> 05:27.199
...and they... And they say that
he realizes that what he did was bad.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.637
Well, I chalked up some more
frequent loser miles today.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.278
The Department of Juvenile Corrections
bussed some delinquents...

05:51.480 --> 05:53.038
...over to the shoe store today...

05:53.240 --> 05:56.710
...to show them why it's so important
to stay in school.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.874
The guards made them watch me work
for over three hours...

06:00.080 --> 06:03.834
...until even the most hardened punk
was crying like a baby.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.637
It's a new programme
called "Scared Rich."

06:08.400 --> 06:11.836
If only they'd had a "scared single"
when I was a punk.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.598
Anyway, I'm home.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.916
Who's gonna be the last straw?

06:16.160 --> 06:18.799
- Al...
- What a shock.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.959
Honey, it's Bud's 18th birthday.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.469
Don't you think it's time
you had a talk with him?

06:24.680 --> 06:27.399
You know, without the bathroom door
in between you.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.471
Well, what am I supposed
to talk about?

06:29.880 --> 06:32.269
The accumulated wisdom
of your lifetime.

06:32.480 --> 06:36.314
You know, like just how deep
does your finger go into your ear.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.478
Oh, and what do you do
when your bellybutton...

06:39.680 --> 06:43.992
...nose and rear end all itch
at the same time.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.193
Don't make him learn it
in the streets, honey.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.476
Come on, Kel.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.154
Eighteen years old, eh?

06:57.360 --> 07:00.318
Son, there's so much
that I wanna say to you...

07:00.520 --> 07:03.398
...but there's a show coming on
I wanna watch.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.755
Soon you'll be getting to that age where
you're thinking about settling down...

07:07.960 --> 07:10.633
...and raising a family.
That is if you're a woman.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.276
If you're a guy, you might consider
doing something for yourself instead.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.233
Remember, a man is a man
all of his life...

07:17.440 --> 07:21.035
...and a woman is only sexy
till she becomes your wife.

07:25.720 --> 07:29.872
I guess what I'm trying to say is
happy birthday, son. Go away.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.798
There he is. The birthday boy.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.959
You mean birthday man, Marcie.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.829
Congratulations, Bud.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.077
Oh, boy, I remember when I was 18.

07:45.280 --> 07:50.229
Girls all over the place,
my phone wouldn't stop ringing.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.598
Boy, it must drive you crazy.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.795
Bud, you are so lucky to be 18
at this time in history.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.596
Back when I turned 18, all there was
was free love, free sex...

08:04.800 --> 08:06.677
...free Huey.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.198
But you're much luckier
than we were...

08:10.400 --> 08:14.996
...because now, with all the numerous
and disfiguring diseases out there...

08:15.960 --> 08:19.236
...young men and women really have
a chance to get to know one another.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.715
To actually be friends...

08:21.920 --> 08:25.310
...and not merely fornicating at will...

08:26.320 --> 08:28.311
...like dogs...

08:29.560 --> 08:32.198
...in unusual places...

08:32.520 --> 08:35.080
...with people you barely know.

08:35.559 --> 08:40.429
And in ways that even today's bawdiest
strumpet could hardly imagine.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.957
Oh, foxy lady...

08:44.440 --> 08:46.954
...coming to get you.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.789
Yep, 18.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.549
Driving my own car,
pad down by the beach...

09:00.760 --> 09:03.877
...cheques coming in from my father.

09:06.760 --> 09:10.275
I tell you, it's the age to be.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.392
So I hear you're getting a pony
and a clown.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.998
You know, it's not just any clown.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.997
Sticky the clown.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.196
Oh, he's out?

09:23.360 --> 09:26.113
Bud, it's for you. It's a girl.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.072
Really?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.158
She wants to take you to a movie.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.192
Well, how about that, folks.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.710
Looks like you can keep your clowns
and your parties...

09:45.920 --> 09:48.559
...and your lame memories of the '60s
or the '20s...

09:48.760 --> 09:51.479
...or whenever the hell
you thought you were cool.

09:53.240 --> 09:58.109
You want a memory,
watch the grandmaster operate.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.875
Hey, babe, how they hanging?

10:07.160 --> 10:09.594
Oh, hi, Grandma.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.270
No, I haven't seen
The Care Bears Big Picnic yet.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.956
Saturday will be fine.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.435
Yes, I got the socks you knitted.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.108
Yes, I'm wearing them.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.348
Yes, I am too old to do that.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.991
Okay.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.915
Yes, I love my mama.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.595
So, what time's Sticky getting here?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.238
- The party's on.
- Okay.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.998
Hey, what kind of cake?

10:51.600 --> 10:55.229
If anybody wants me,
I'll be upstairs dead by my own hand.

10:55.440 --> 11:00.434
Son, I was saving this
until you were really low.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.348
What?

11:02.560 --> 11:05.233
Coppola's daughter
wants to have tea?

11:05.800 --> 11:08.189
Do you wanna spend your birthday
atop a dying horse...

11:08.400 --> 11:11.995
...while a clown squirts you with seltzer
and your Mom takes pictures?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.077
- No, Dad.
- Then shut up and get over here.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.111
You're gonna do
what every male Bundy does...

11:18.320 --> 11:19.992
...when he reaches the age of 18.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.749
- Aren't we doing that right now, Dad...?
- Oh, shut up, son.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.115
No. Tonight I'm...

11:29.520 --> 11:32.398
I'm taking you to the nudie bar.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.116
Oh, Dad.

11:40.320 --> 11:45.348
My father took me just as his father,
Jebediah Bundy, took him.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.434
Seems that throughout history
all male Bundys...

11:48.640 --> 11:52.553
...and looking at hooters that
don't belong to them go hand in hand.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.949
I knew you loved me.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.919
Yes, the nudie bar.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.279
Where the music stinks
And they water the drinks

12:02.480 --> 12:03.708
The nudie bar

12:03.920 --> 12:06.718
Where the girlies dance
In their underpants

12:06.920 --> 12:08.319
The nudie bar

12:08.520 --> 12:12.752
Where you'll see their butt
And their traps stay shut

12:20.360 --> 12:21.918
At the nudie bar

12:22.160 --> 12:23.229
Here come the women, son.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.638
Now remember, this is our secret.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.877
- Do not give them a clue.
- Okay.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.910
Well, son, it's your birthday.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.475
You sit anywhere you want.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.316
Alrighty.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.154
Except there, son. It's...

13:15.360 --> 13:17.237
It's demeaning for the dancers...

13:17.440 --> 13:21.433
...and besides, that's where the nickels
people throw usually land.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.676
Here we go, son.

13:24.640 --> 13:28.076
Reserved for A. And B. Bundy.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.677
- Oh, Dad.
- I know, I know.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.553
All right, son. Sit here.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.193
Are you ready?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.072
I think so, Dad.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.395
Then go to it.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.197
Take it off.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.158
Did you hear my boy say, "Take it off"?

13:55.320 --> 13:56.799
Was it really that good, Dad?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.798
If this old heart could talk.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.590
And now, son,
something really special.

14:08.800 --> 14:13.794
I'm giving you 6 bucks.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.359
Oh, Dad, your whole paycheque.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.152
That's right, son.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.191
No, no, son, it's not for you.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.833
No, it's for the girls.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.112
You're gonna be tempted to spend
all your money on the first girl...

14:28.320 --> 14:29.753
...but don't do it.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.270
Six bucks is too much money
to spend on any woman.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.673
Don't worry about me, Dad.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.553
It takes more than a little leg
to shake me up.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.838
Oh, that Sticky.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.357
I never dreamed I could find
someone like him for only $5.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.597
He's still got it, hasn't he?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.596
We're here.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.958
No, Buck, it's not Bud.

15:39.160 --> 15:44.996
Well, well, aren't you a big,
sexy, whatever you are.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.549
I'll just go upstairs,
splash on some Old Spice...

15:49.760 --> 15:52.433
...and we be getting it on.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.076
Kelly, is this a friend of Bud's?

16:02.280 --> 16:05.477
No, actually,
you can't find one of those.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.908
But this is Roxanne...

16:07.120 --> 16:09.475
...the girl that Bud loves,
but who can't stand him.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.752
I thought I'd do something nice for him,
so I convinced her to come.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.110
He's really dying?

16:16.440 --> 16:18.351
You've seen him.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.276
I'm gonna miss him.

16:23.480 --> 16:27.268
You must have confused me
with a clown who gives a damn.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.119
I got the cake.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.430
No, Buck, that's Jefferson, not Bud.

16:37.640 --> 16:40.154
Lik e I give a cat's ass.

16:43.280 --> 16:47.796
If you want me, I'll be out in the yard
getting me some spotted stuff.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.033
Jefferson, it took you three hours
to get the cake?

16:53.240 --> 16:58.678
Well, we were talking about our youth
and all, and I got kind of nostalgic...

16:58.880 --> 17:01.314
...so I bought a '65 Mustang.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.153
You bought a '65 Mustang?

17:05.359 --> 17:07.999
Well, when are you gonna get a job
to drive it to?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.479
Hey, I look in the papers...

17:10.680 --> 17:14.513
...it's just by the time I get up,
all the good jobs are taken.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.191
You are gonna take
that car back today.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.627
Right now, this instant.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.955
And I don't wanna hear another...

17:29.720 --> 17:32.188
Oh, all right.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.752
You can keep it.

17:34.960 --> 17:39.476
- But no more cars this year.
- Okay.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.437
- I'm Sticky.
- Me too...

17:47.480 --> 17:50.711
...but at least I've got a car.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.478
Kelly, I've got to go.

17:53.680 --> 17:58.515
I'm not spending my Saturday night
sitting here next to your father.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.195
Are you kidding?

18:02.400 --> 18:05.233
My father is not a clown,
he's a shoe...

18:06.680 --> 18:09.069
Yeah, you're right, that's my Dad.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.076
Kelly, don't lie to the girl.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.673
My husband is dead, Roxanne.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.194
Hey, so when we gonna fire up
this wingding?

18:20.160 --> 18:23.072
Well, we'll start the party
as soon as Al and Bud get home.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.471
Tricks of the trade, son.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.591
When I die, this'll be yours.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.472
Maybe.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.318
Dad, I'm broke and I'm bored.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.238
Well, I'll handle it, son. Watch this.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.272
See, I told you
you don't need money to have fun.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.751
You're the greatest, Dad.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.316
Hey, young man, I sense a tone.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.511
What's wrong now?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.631
This place sucks when you're broke.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.115
What place doesn't suck
when you're broke?

19:29.320 --> 19:32.392
To tell you the truth, it does get
kind of boring in here sometimes.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.591
So then why do you come?

19:37.240 --> 19:38.309
For this.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.760
Excuse me, sir.
You bumped into me...

19:42.960 --> 19:46.270
...and I think you owe me an apology.
- Drop dead.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.392
Fine!

19:54.720 --> 19:58.235
Go ahead, rookie,
take your best shot.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.036
Hey.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.598
- You all right, son?
- I'm all right, Dad. Look out, Dad!

21:10.280 --> 21:15.434
I hope it was as good
for whatever that was as it was for me.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.999
Hey, what do I care.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.117
I got mine.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.230
Eighteen years old
and your first bar fight...

21:35.440 --> 21:37.829
...like every other male Bundy
before you.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.237
I'm proud of you son.
How do you feel?

21:44.920 --> 21:47.036
I feel great, Dad.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.958
But where do we tell Mom we went?

21:49.160 --> 21:50.673
Well, son, you're a man now.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.634
You stare her straight in the eye, and
you tell her we were stuck in traffic.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.909
But we know where we were.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.951
The nudie bar.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.791
Where you can't touch a breast,
But you can cave in a chest

22:05.000 --> 22:07.230
At the nudie bar

22:07.480 --> 22:10.074
Where you can look at a thigh
And black en an eye

22:10.280 --> 22:12.077
At the nudie bar

22:12.280 --> 22:17.149
Where the beer gives you gas,
But the Bundys kick ass

22:23.680 --> 22:27.116
At the nudie bar

22:28.305 --> 22:34.636
