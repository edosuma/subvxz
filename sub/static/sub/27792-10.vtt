00:01.000 --> 00:02.441
<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

00:02.586 --> 00:03.997
My mother was
a hedge witch, too.

00:04.086 --> 00:05.669
I didn't know
you were a hedge.

00:05.756 --> 00:08.715
Oh, yes. My mentor,
Everett, found me.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.971
The Foremost saved them
with special weapons

00:23.065 --> 00:24.226
that expel possession.

00:24.316 --> 00:27.354
They call them ice axes,
and I'm assuming that's poetic license.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.151
So, we might have
a chance to save Eliot.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.063
Overthrow me right
the fuck now, Fen.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.524
- I never should have...
- Or I will never forgive you.

00:34.618 --> 00:35.779
And neither will Eliot,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.657
if you keep me from getting
the one thing that can save him.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.957
When the going gets tough,

00:44.044 --> 00:45.751
tough listens
to pop anthems from the '80s.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.171
Hi. It's me. It's the real me.
It's Eliot.

00:49.258 --> 00:52.001
This is a mind palace situation
and we don't have a lot of time,

00:52.094 --> 00:54.014
and I have some extremely
major shit to tell you.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.962
<i>Some god of war.</i>

00:56.056 --> 00:59.049
He only liked them
when they were too weak to fight.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.633
He's not trying
to rebuild his body.

01:00.727 --> 01:01.927
That's not what
the stones are.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.562
That's not what they're for.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.980
It's so much worse than that.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.520
- Just breathe.
- If the stones aren't for building a body,

01:11.613 --> 01:12.693
what does
he want with them?

01:12.739 --> 01:16.733
No, he's building a body.
His sister's.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.363
He's trying to bring her
back to life.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.570
Oh, my God.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.954
That's the girl he thought was a sacrifice
to summon Enyalius, but she wasn't.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.563
Enyalius and the other gods
killed her.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.250
They chopped her up and turned
her into four stone organs.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.332
- Jesus. There's two of them.
- Yeah.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.463
And if he got prison
and she got the death penalty,

01:34.553 --> 01:36.044
I'm guessing
she's the bad one.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.430
Till he remembers,

01:37.764 --> 01:39.756
he won't know
to go look for Enyalius.

01:42.811 --> 01:43.811
Hi.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.522
If you want to talk to me,
the price is a drink.

01:49.401 --> 01:50.437
You're fun.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.028
One drink.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.236
- What are you having, ma'am?
- Vodka ice.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.568
Vodka ice.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.413
There you go.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.294
- I have a question.
- No, I don't come here often.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.995
You haven't
seen me anywhere.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.797
And, yes, I do
have plans this weekend.

02:13.925 --> 02:14.925
Still have a question?

02:15.969 --> 02:16.969
Yes.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.757
Why does this place
smell like death?

02:27.481 --> 02:29.973
It is weird, right?

02:30.067 --> 02:32.605
Bar next to a hospital.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.104
Doctors need happy hour,
too, I guess.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.532
So that's what you are?
A doctor?

02:40.243 --> 02:41.324
No.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.246
I'm sick.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.372
But I got good news today.

02:47.459 --> 02:50.372
I'll only be sick
for another two months.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.088
Three, maybe.

02:55.175 --> 02:59.715
Sometimes my friend says
one thing but means another thing.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.797
Is that what you're doing?

03:04.559 --> 03:07.302
- Keep 'em coming.
- Keep 'em coming.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.732
<i>Meet me in a restaurant</i>

03:17.531 --> 03:20.524
<i>Meet me on the top
of the world</i>

03:21.535 --> 03:25.324
<i>Meet me
And we'll talk the language of love</i>

03:29.459 --> 03:32.497
<i>I'll meet you
anywhere you want</i>

03:33.714 --> 03:35.296
<i>I'll meet you
on a ballroom floor</i>

03:35.382 --> 03:37.749
Well, I'm definitely hitting
my step goals today, huh?

03:37.843 --> 03:41.587
<i>Meet me and we'll float to
the level above</i>

03:44.766 --> 03:46.126
<i>I wish you'd drop
what you're doing</i>

03:50.230 --> 03:53.143
Jesus, fuck,
a wise man's donkey.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.237
Just give me a sign.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.573
Come on. Where's water?

04:10.667 --> 04:11.667
Anything.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.866
Wait.

04:54.085 --> 04:57.920
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

04:59.257 --> 05:03.001
<i>If I'm looking kind of dazzled</i>

05:03.094 --> 05:04.380
El?

05:04.471 --> 05:08.636
<i>I see neon lights</i>

05:08.767 --> 05:12.101
<i>Whenever you walk by</i>

05:12.187 --> 05:13.187
Eliot?

05:13.271 --> 05:16.059
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

05:16.149 --> 05:17.685
Oh, my God.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.360
<i>If you say hello
and I take a ride</i>

05:22.614 --> 05:26.073
<i>Upon a sea
where the mystic moon</i>

05:27.494 --> 05:29.736
<i>Is playing havoc
with the tide</i>

05:29.830 --> 05:31.492
Hey! It's you, right?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.038
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

05:33.124 --> 05:35.832
It can't be The Monster.
He doesn't have the moves.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.747
Hey, what are you
doing here?

05:38.964 --> 05:41.627
Turn down the music
and talk to me, will you?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.176
Wait a sec.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.210
Whoa.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.838
Oh, my God.
I'm tripping on lizard.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.802
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

05:55.814 --> 05:58.682
<i>If I'm acting so distracted</i>

06:00.527 --> 06:03.361
<i>I'm thinking
about the fireworks</i>

06:03.655 --> 06:05.191
Oh, come on.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.650
<i>That go off when you smile</i>

06:09.661 --> 06:12.825
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

06:14.457 --> 06:17.575
<i>If I split
like light refracted</i>

06:19.170 --> 06:22.629
<i>I'm only off to wander</i>

06:24.259 --> 06:27.798
<i>Across a moonlit mile</i>

06:30.557 --> 06:34.722
<i>Once in a while,
two people meet</i>

06:34.811 --> 06:39.727
<i>Seemingly for no reason
Theyjust pass on the street</i>

06:39.816 --> 06:44.026
<i>Suddenly thundershowers
everywhere</i>

06:44.529 --> 06:46.862
<i>Who can explain
the thunder and rain?</i>

06:46.948 --> 06:49.782
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy to see you.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.656
Where are you taking me, Eliot?
I'm so thirsty.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.363
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

06:57.083 --> 07:00.497
<i>If I come
and go like fashion</i>

07:01.796 --> 07:04.664
<i>I might be great tomorrow</i>

07:06.551 --> 07:10.886
<i>But hopeless yesterday</i>

07:10.972 --> 07:15.933
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

07:16.019 --> 07:18.932
<i>If I fall
in the mode of passion</i>

07:20.231 --> 07:23.645
<i>It might be unbelievable</i>

07:25.362 --> 07:28.821
<i>But let's not say so long</i>

07:30.033 --> 07:31.990
<i>It might be just fantastic</i>

07:34.454 --> 07:37.071
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

07:47.759 --> 07:49.500
Woman, hello.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.806
Oh, hey.

07:54.975 --> 07:55.975
Hi.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.847
Can't believe that psychotropic
douche got me here.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.936
Can I get some water?

08:07.362 --> 08:09.445
Who wants
the honor of killing her?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.523
Hey, if water's a dealio,
I'm good.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.323
Oh, we have water.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.742
What we don't have
are strangers

08:14.828 --> 08:16.348
- wandering into our camp.
- Her wrist.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.703
Our enemy's enemy
is our ally.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.083
Well, how about that?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.220
You're in pain,
aren't you?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.358
Come with me.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.063
I can take it away.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.645
Sorry,
but I got to get home

08:50.739 --> 08:54.153
and tell my parents
all the medical debt was for nothing.

08:58.830 --> 08:59.830
Thanks for the drinks.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.790
Wait.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.626
Do that again.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.629
My face.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.456
Touch my face.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.011
Are you okay?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.974
Whenever you touch my face,
I remember something.

09:23.521 --> 09:24.521
Again.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.481
You remind me of someone
I had forgotten...

09:33.531 --> 09:34.531
My sister.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.325
I'm gonna leave.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.617
No, you have to
come with me now.

09:38.703 --> 09:39.944
No, I'm...

09:49.506 --> 09:50.506
What's up?

09:51.132 --> 09:53.215
This was
in the Mirror World.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.918
And I heard you were looking
for the binder, so...

09:57.138 --> 09:59.505
Holy shit.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.841
It's in some language
I've never seen before. I...

10:01.935 --> 10:06.020
Well, I'll get on this just as soon
as we find Enyalius.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.893
Hopefully before
The Monster does.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.815
I thought we wanted him
to find Enyalius.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.019
Yeah, we did,
but we were wrong.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.604
He's building his sister.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.614
What are y'all doing?

10:18.535 --> 10:21.198
Tracking the Library's entire
magic infrastructure

10:21.287 --> 10:23.779
to find weak points
and start a rebellion.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.292
But, um, good luck
with yours.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.711
Yeah. Thanks. You, too.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.584
Yeah, I can tell you
what he looks like,

10:32.757 --> 10:34.669
the food the dude
likes to eat,

10:34.759 --> 10:36.671
but shit-all
for anything useful.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.548
One thing is bugging me.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.845
In the memory,

10:39.931 --> 10:42.139
I could swear he was
wearing a ring, emerald.

10:42.517 --> 10:46.136
Guy is described up and down,
but nothing about the ring.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.414
Wait a minute.
Did you say emerald?

10:47.438 --> 10:48.438
Yeah.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.482
When I did research
with the Free Traders,

10:51.568 --> 10:54.356
there was this god.
What was his name? Uh...

10:54.779 --> 10:57.237
He... He always
worked in disguise,

10:57.323 --> 11:01.237
but he was known for always
wearing an emerald ring.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.819
So Enyalius is a front.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.074
Here.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.281
Aengus.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.828
Celtic god.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.126
- Jules, it says here he's a trickster.
- It's fine.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.424
And we...
It wouldn't be a summoning.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.968
We can only get to him
through a magical creature.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.795
Apparently there's
a whole species

11:21.890 --> 11:24.758
that exists to entertain him
and protect him.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.889
And they're
really annoying and...

11:27.979 --> 11:31.393
What I'm getting at is,
we need to find a leprechaun.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.244
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.422
Listen, I... I just saw
this red sand out there.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.588
It was following me.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.792
I thought it was
'cause I was tripping balls.

12:00.762 --> 12:01.843
Our desert is alive.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.052
It's filled with demon spirits
that attack our women.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.262
Okay.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.346
Speaking of D-spirits,
I'm looking for something

12:11.481 --> 12:13.768
- I think you guys have.
- You know what can happen.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.085
- A pair of black...
- You're angry with me?

12:15.109 --> 12:16.771
How dare you?

12:17.111 --> 12:19.173
You lay with my sister,
and I'm the one you scream at?

12:19.197 --> 12:20.688
I'm the one you threaten?

12:20.782 --> 12:23.274
- Zal, calm yourself.
- Pig!

12:23.952 --> 12:25.179
You want my sister?
She's yours.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.284
Wow.

12:26.621 --> 12:27.987
Desert Dynasty.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.788
Think we're gonna
get a girl fight?

12:29.874 --> 12:32.116
Jesus, how long
does one lick last?

12:32.210 --> 12:34.497
Take her. You two
deserve each other.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.330
You must be silent! Now.

12:50.895 --> 12:51.895
Gross.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.477
But cool, but gross.

13:16.796 --> 13:21.086
So, anytime a woman gets
a teensy bit emotional,

13:21.175 --> 13:24.043
one of those things rises up
out of the sand, and what?

13:24.721 --> 13:26.212
Possesses her.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.847
Eventually causing paralysis,
even death.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.142
Men save us because they alone
have the strength to survive.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.311
And the spirit zoo
you got going?

13:34.397 --> 13:35.729
They can't be killed,

13:35.815 --> 13:37.681
so I've learned
how to imprison them.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.226
Some brave dudes.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.103
And some awfully
compliant women.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.954
You're not seeing or hearing this,
are you?

13:53.666 --> 13:54.782
Seeing or hearing...

13:56.085 --> 13:57.085
I thought so.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.413
Man, this lizard's got
a half-life like uranium.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.999
So the guy with the axes,
which tent's he hang his thong in?

14:05.803 --> 14:08.386
Have we identified the leader
of the Serpent group yet?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.301
Not yet, but we're looking.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.684
Where?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.102
Phyllis is in charge
of that investigation.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.896
I could join her.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.835
Perhaps there are places
she doesn't know to look

14:19.859 --> 14:22.567
that I would,
considering my past.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.565
That's a very generous offer.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.529
But it seems that you have
enough on your plate already.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.155
Hmm.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.281
Very well.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.829
I was just
sitting in a bar

14:33.915 --> 14:36.373
when a bear named Humbledrum
started talking to me.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.543
What can I tell you?
Fillory's a weird place.

14:39.962 --> 14:40.962
So I hear.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.955
- But you...
- Mmm-hmm.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.881
- A woman...
- Mmm-hmm.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.209
- As king?
- Talking animals.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.183
I'm gonna go
get some more.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.746
Wow.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.538
Light speed, Bambi.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.287
Okay, can you just tell me?

15:19.377 --> 15:20.959
What the hell are you?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.581
Pieces of you.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.295
Your spirit guide.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.170
Your memories.
Your Eliot.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.088
Your conscience.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.888
- Speaking of conscience...
- Wait, what?

15:32.974 --> 15:34.556
You're really gonna
pass lycanthropy

15:34.642 --> 15:36.679
to a guy who lives
on a planet with two moons?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.122
I'll tell them I'm surfing
the red breakers,

15:38.146 --> 15:39.226
and we got to get creative.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.104
And this is just
to get the axes.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.770
Out, now.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.280
And this is
guiding me how?

15:51.117 --> 15:56.078
It's the song you think to yourself
whenever you're working a guy, remember?

15:56.539 --> 15:58.656
High school,
junior year?

15:58.958 --> 16:01.792
- Ray Latanza.
- Ray Latanza.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.039
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.870
This song came out
on the car radio.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.707
I wanted to ride in his Porsche,
so I gave him a hand job.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.917
In your own driveway,
which is sad,

16:10.011 --> 16:11.252
'cause then your dad
walked out.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.428
Okay, road closure
on Memory Lane.

16:14.182 --> 16:18.051
<i>I don't know
where I'm going</i>

16:18.978 --> 16:23.222
<i>But I sure know
where I've been</i>

16:24.108 --> 16:29.228
<i>Hanging on the promises
in the songs of yesterday</i>

16:29.530 --> 16:33.069
<i>'Cause I've made up my mind</i>

16:34.869 --> 16:37.577
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

16:37.663 --> 16:40.326
<i>Here I go again</i>

16:43.085 --> 16:45.122
<i>Here I go again</i>

16:45.213 --> 16:46.795
Hey, Margo.
Thanks for inviting me.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.088
I invited her?

16:49.759 --> 16:53.173
<i>Though I keep searching
for an answer</i>

16:54.764 --> 16:59.304
<i>I never seem to find
what I'm looking for</i>

16:59.393 --> 17:04.512
<i>O Lord, I pray
You give me the strength to carry on</i>

17:05.358 --> 17:09.271
<i>'Cause I know what it means</i>

17:09.362 --> 17:13.026
<i>To walk along the lonely
street of dreams</i>

17:15.159 --> 17:19.153
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

17:19.247 --> 17:23.662
<i>Going down the only road
I've ever known</i>

17:24.669 --> 17:28.458
<i>Like a drifter,
I was born to walk alone</i>

17:30.800 --> 17:34.635
<i>And I made up my mind</i>

17:35.680 --> 17:38.639
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

17:42.019 --> 17:46.263
The Library says that they have
sufficient levels of ambient magic.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.937
Magic output reports
are published weekly.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.735
Yeah, well, we didn't trust
them, and guess what.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.355
Look.

17:54.448 --> 17:58.533
This is how much magic the Library says is
being distributed as ambient.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.537
And this is the level
in the pipes right now.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.076
It's nothing close to the amount
of magic they say there is.

18:08.004 --> 18:12.169
So long as Library members
get their Deweys, who cares?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.300
Beside hedges.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.672
- That can't be right.
- It is.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.008
We bugged the pipes.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.511
A beetle
with McCormick's tracer.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.302
Were you mapping
the pipe system?

18:25.396 --> 18:27.262
Trying to.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.895
Until our beetle disintegrated
somewhere outside Earth.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.977
But the spell
shows magic levels.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.110
And when we saw this,
we thought we should show you,

18:35.156 --> 18:36.522
because I don't think
you signed up

18:36.616 --> 18:39.859
to work for an organization
that lies, right?

18:39.952 --> 18:42.365
- I'm sure there's an explanation.
- There is.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.539
Harriet told you and me.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.208
Everett's trying
to squeeze out hedges.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.035
This is just
more of the same.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.371
Look, you are on the inside.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.216
You can find out where
the extra magic is going

18:56.302 --> 18:59.636
and why they're hoarding it
and why the Library is lying.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.221
Mmm.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.217
Yeah, sweetie.
Just let me borrow them.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.224
I'll have them back in a day,
two at the most.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.774
- No one else can use them but me.
- Mmm!

19:12.902 --> 19:14.438
They're enchanted.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.737
As I'm sure you can understand
better than most.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.740
I, uh...

19:21.410 --> 19:23.652
I loved it last night
when you did that thing to me.

19:25.247 --> 19:29.207
What are you,
some kind of witch?

19:29.794 --> 19:30.794
Magician.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.624
So can I get ones
that work for me?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.505
You'll have to make your own.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.082
Swell. How?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.260
Mostly white, no?

19:49.563 --> 19:51.099
But every hundredth
grain or so...

19:54.276 --> 19:55.276
Is black.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.903
Mmm.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.275
A warrior goes
alone into the desert,

20:00.074 --> 20:01.940
picks out only the black ones,

20:02.535 --> 20:04.492
enough to fill a large bag,

20:05.538 --> 20:06.779
which is then forged.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.581
Thanks.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.125
- You're gonna try?
- I'm gonna do.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.422
If you get the least bit emotional,
the spirits will possess you.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.123
Clear on that.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.174
And there'll be
no man to protect you.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.220
- Story of my life.
- And you can't use magic.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.888
- It renders the grains...
- Impotent?

20:27.268 --> 20:29.976
- I don't know that word.
- You sure don't, Marathon Man.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.226
<i>I'm just another heart
in need of rescue</i>

20:39.029 --> 20:42.318
<i>Waiting on
love's sweet charity</i>

20:44.368 --> 20:48.738
<i>And I'm gonna hold on
for the rest of my days</i>

20:49.874 --> 20:51.490
What is she doing here?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.701
- Four-octave range, bitch.
- Seriously?

20:53.794 --> 20:55.831
I got my id,
my lost innocence,

20:55.921 --> 20:59.210
my guilt,
and now my inadequacy?

20:59.759 --> 21:03.673
<i>'Cause I know
what it means</i>

21:03.763 --> 21:08.007
<i>To walk along the lonely
street of dreams</i>

21:09.143 --> 21:13.183
<i>And here I go again
on my own</i>

21:13.939 --> 21:18.104
<i>Going down the only road
I've ever known</i>

21:19.028 --> 21:23.193
<i>Like a drifter, I was born
to walk alone</i>

21:25.326 --> 21:28.444
<i>And I've made up my mind</i>

21:30.623 --> 21:33.206
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

21:33.292 --> 21:35.249
<i>But here I go again</i>

21:35.336 --> 21:36.872
Okay, this is too much.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.954
Your subconscious thought
you needed some wisdom.

21:39.048 --> 21:42.507
You do whiskey,
not wisdom.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.676
Okay. Fine.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.798
<i>And I
made up my mind</i>

21:50.643 --> 21:53.636
<i>I ain't wasting
no more time</i>

21:53.729 --> 21:55.186
Show-off.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.936
<i>Here I go again</i>

22:00.319 --> 22:04.233
<i>Here I go again</i>

22:05.282 --> 22:09.617
<i>Here I go again</i>

22:11.121 --> 22:16.412
<i>Here I go!</i>

22:22.800 --> 22:24.110
Ah, morning.
What can I do you for?

22:24.134 --> 22:27.002
Uh, we were hoping that you could
help us find somebody.

22:27.096 --> 22:30.260
Well, I'm not sure about that,
but, uh, I can fix your shoes.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.102
- Uh, this is Berry's, right?
- Yeah.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.053
I'm Berry, so...

22:37.147 --> 22:38.433
We're looking
for a leprechaun.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.943
Right. So are you looking for, like,
a pot-of-gold leprechaun,

22:47.032 --> 22:49.820
or is this a breakfast-cereal
situation, or...

22:49.910 --> 22:51.304
We're looking
for a god named Aengus,

22:51.328 --> 22:53.014
but to find him we have to talk
to a leprechaun first,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.496
and I know this is
a bat-shit thing to say

22:55.583 --> 22:57.825
with a straight face,
but if you could help us...

23:00.045 --> 23:03.038
Well, all right,
since you're desperate.

23:03.757 --> 23:04.964
Are you the leprechaun?

23:05.050 --> 23:07.963
What do you expect some short
little bearded child in overalls

23:08.053 --> 23:09.385
with a buckle on me hat?

23:09.847 --> 23:10.949
Why didn't you just tell us?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.853
Because you're hysterical
when you're desperate.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.003
Want to see Aengus?

23:23.027 --> 23:24.438
He's right through there.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.317
Great. No knob.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.355
Someone's trying
to kill your boss,

23:34.413 --> 23:36.871
and we need to warn him,
so, please, just let us through.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.493
No.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.622
Aengus is pretty strict on that.
Keeps out the riffraff.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.332
Don't worry.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.789
Everything you need to open
the door is in here.

23:45.883 --> 23:46.999
It's fun.

23:47.092 --> 23:50.631
It's an escape room,
like for kids' parties.

23:51.972 --> 23:52.972
Not ours.

24:56.704 --> 25:02.746
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

25:03.419 --> 25:07.629
<i>Wake unto me</i>

25:09.758 --> 25:13.468
<i>Starlight and dew drops</i>

25:13.554 --> 25:17.594
<i>Are waiting for thee</i>

25:18.142 --> 25:19.142
Enough.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.470
You loved this song when you were little
and your father sang it.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.226
You're me, right?

25:25.315 --> 25:27.477
I run me, so shut it.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.489
Yes.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.438
- It's okay. I think I can get it.
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

26:22.873 --> 26:23.873
Lets the knob down,

26:23.957 --> 26:25.852
but if you stick your arm up there,
you'll just get sliced up.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.647
We have no idea how close The Monster is.
So, if I get cut, I get cut.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.191
We don't have time
to argue about this.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.873
Stupid, 'cause one of us here
is indestructible.

26:54.905 --> 26:57.318
It's you. Julia.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.738
Aengus has been
very interested in you.

27:00.828 --> 27:01.948
What's that
supposed to mean?

27:02.287 --> 27:03.869
No, no, nothing to worry.

27:03.956 --> 27:08.701
We've all been interested in the girl
who became the goddess who became...

27:08.794 --> 27:11.252
Shit. We still need a key.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.485
Well, then maybe Aengus
would appreciate if you let us through.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.749
Aw...

27:15.843 --> 27:16.843
I can't.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.810
I quit.
I can't do this anymore.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.602
That goddamn lullaby.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.727
He'd sing it
every night to me.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.273
Even away on business,

27:37.447 --> 27:39.029
he'd sing it over the phone.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.992
He called me
his little princess.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.870
He was better
than other dads.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.659
And he thought I was better
than other daughters.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.919
- Until...
- You had the audacity to grow up.

27:58.343 --> 28:01.256
Fuckin' apologies
for the surprise, Dad.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.721
He saw what he raised...

28:04.266 --> 28:06.223
A woman
he couldn't control.

28:06.977 --> 28:09.014
Who didn't need
anyone else's approval.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.347
Nothing deadlier
to the fragile male ego.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.862
He was the one who told me
I could be anything.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.694
And I believed him.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.994
But he didn't tell you
that the world makes you choose.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.659
You can be
one of the smart ones

28:28.749 --> 28:32.709
or one of the pretty ones
or even a strong one.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.377
- But...
- Try to be all three...

28:37.341 --> 28:39.424
You better learn to smile
and shut up...

28:40.385 --> 28:42.297
'Cause the second
you're you,

28:42.387 --> 28:44.299
the second...

28:44.389 --> 28:46.802
Out loud, pissed off,

28:47.392 --> 28:48.803
it's, "What a bitch."

28:50.020 --> 28:51.727
"What a slut."

28:52.147 --> 28:54.434
"Who the fuck
does she think she is?"

28:56.902 --> 28:58.814
So you never
give them a chance.

28:59.321 --> 29:00.402
You hit first.

29:01.198 --> 29:05.533
And anyone dumb enough to hit back soon
finds that there's no hurting you,

29:06.036 --> 29:10.201
sheathed in all that
hard, glossy armor.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.908
Then why does it
hurt so much?

29:15.796 --> 29:19.255
Why does it feel like
I'm losing my mind, Eliot?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.129
Wind and sand

29:23.929 --> 29:26.717
reduce mountains
into rubble.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.549
Are you stronger
than a mountain?

29:31.937 --> 29:33.644
I'm a king.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.269
Not a goddamn princess.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.568
A king.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.530
You were.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.820
I'm still a king.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.659
King of manipulation.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.041
King of pointless rage.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.415
King of "I can't do this."

29:59.047 --> 30:01.039
King of "He was right."

30:04.886 --> 30:07.094
King of "I eventually
fuck up everything."

30:07.180 --> 30:10.218
- That's not true.
- That's what Eliot would say.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.178
But you're not Eliot,
are you?

30:14.146 --> 30:15.387
You're me.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.477
And we know.

30:19.985 --> 30:23.524
Margo. Don't...

30:23.989 --> 30:24.989
Get angry?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.529
I'm angry

30:29.619 --> 30:31.531
every second.

30:32.873 --> 30:36.992
Every second my eyes are open
because I know who I am.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.577
Not what I pretend to be.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.169
Can't do anything
except pose and judge.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.967
Margo, you have to stop.

30:48.889 --> 30:52.553
The only thing I ever did right
was be your best friend.

30:53.810 --> 30:57.349
That's the only thing
I ever got right.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.101
And I can't even do that,

30:59.191 --> 31:01.183
or else this fucking bag

31:01.276 --> 31:03.108
would be fucking full!

31:43.860 --> 31:44.860
Wait.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.489
You're a girl?

31:51.701 --> 31:54.739
Sorry, woman. Female?

31:56.039 --> 31:57.530
And how am I hearing you?

32:00.752 --> 32:02.209
You're in my thoughts.

32:02.963 --> 32:03.999
Who isn't?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.442
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah, of course.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.466
Of course.

32:09.636 --> 32:12.504
So then maybe you can tell me
if you're a womanish thing,

32:13.473 --> 32:16.716
why do you do such shitty things
to other women?

32:19.938 --> 32:20.938
What?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.608
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.271
- Last one.
- It doesn't work.

32:30.949 --> 32:31.949
God damn it.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.659
Come on.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.666
You may enter.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.244
Aengus. Or, Enyalius.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.108
Whatever your name is.
Do we... We're too late.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.293
Shit. Shit.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.093
Oh, your face.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.199
- What the hell, dude?
- We were trying to warn you.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.636
Yeah, yeah,
I got you good.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.685
Your anxieties
are glowing.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.430
- This one especially.
- The Monster is coming for you.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.107
The one that you
locked up in Blackspire.

33:07.569 --> 33:10.903
You care for a snack? Something to drink?
I mean, you've certainly earned it.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.732
No. No. We...
We want you to leave.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.612
I have a place to hide.

33:15.702 --> 33:19.912
I just refuse
to let your panic infect me.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.285
Happiness is a choice,
you know.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.082
Yeah, well,
you should turn the panic up.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.081
We wasted so much time
in your escape-room shit,

33:26.171 --> 33:28.083
The Monster could be here
any second.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.511
You mortals are always
so precious about time.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.930
"There's never
enough of it."

33:38.016 --> 33:41.600
"Ahh! Every second,
I'm closer to death. Ahh!"

33:42.020 --> 33:43.727
Well, yes, but...

33:44.064 --> 33:47.683
How can you enjoy life if you're
in constant fear of its end?

33:48.276 --> 33:52.486
Think on it.
Except you, of course, Julia.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.114
It's a fascinating
pleasure.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.447
We're trying to save you.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.778
You need to hide now.

34:00.121 --> 34:01.202
Hide?

34:02.207 --> 34:05.291
Yes, it took me a while
to shake the mortal fear, too.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.956
You'll get there.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.089
So that's a no
on the snacks?

34:13.802 --> 34:17.091
I did hope that the decoy
and alias would keep him at bay,

34:17.179 --> 34:18.967
but just in case...

34:21.101 --> 34:22.512
Fallout shelter of sorts.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.639
No one, not even
The Monster, can get in.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.848
It's gonna be so very boring,
but, uh...

34:30.652 --> 34:32.518
Since you insist.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.480
- Thank God.
- You're most welcome.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.699
- But before I, um...
- Jesus Christ.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.487
Julia, come with me.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.164
What?

34:44.248 --> 34:47.083
I know a thing or two
about god powers.

34:47.168 --> 34:50.002
I'm sure I can fix
whatever's wrong with you.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.840
We're more alike
than you know.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.096
Think it over.

35:01.266 --> 35:05.010
Whilst I remember
my password.

35:15.697 --> 35:18.189
So, can we do
this thing or what?

35:18.283 --> 35:20.525
- I don't mean to be brusque.
- Do what?

35:20.619 --> 35:22.827
Turn my black sand into axes.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.497
Uh-oh.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.957
Guys, whatever
the joke is, skip it.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.460
- It's just so...
- Richly enjoyable.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.753
Not to mention a first.

35:32.839 --> 35:35.456
You should feel good
at least.

35:35.842 --> 35:39.085
No other woman has ever gone alone
out there and come back

35:39.179 --> 35:40.545
with all of that.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.134
- Most give up.
- Or die.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.640
Yeah, hilarious.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.762
I can't believe
your kingdom exiled you.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.522
You're strong, smart...

35:53.401 --> 35:55.358
And a very adequate whore.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.812
Oh, yeah, it's a big uh-oh.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.844
You know, a funny thing
happened out there.

36:01.868 --> 36:04.406
I met one of them,
a demon spirit.

36:05.121 --> 36:08.205
And I got the whole download on
how this place really rolls.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.246
See, I lost my shit,

36:11.711 --> 36:13.293
<i>in a big way.</i>

36:13.672 --> 36:15.254
And she came up
out of the sand.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.378
Only, I didn't see
shifty, scary smoke.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.543
<i>I saw her.</i>

36:23.723 --> 36:25.931
Maybe it's this weirdo
fairy eye I have.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.929
It's a long
and very bizarre story

36:28.019 --> 36:30.762
for another day
and another quest.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.765
<i>But I also heard her.</i>

36:35.568 --> 36:37.355
<i>She didn't attack me.</i>

36:37.904 --> 36:39.361
<i>That's not what they do.</i>

36:39.989 --> 36:41.669
But you guys already
know that, don't know?

36:41.866 --> 36:45.610
You and your whole ruling council of
pussy-phobic chuckle-dicks.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.196
'Cause those spirits,
when they hear a woman

36:48.289 --> 36:51.248
who's sad
or scared or upset...

36:52.460 --> 36:54.076
Or angry...

36:55.255 --> 36:57.588
They rise up
out of the sand to help.

36:59.426 --> 37:03.466
And they help by possessing
whatever man is causing the distress.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.173
They're protectors.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.560
<i>And if the problem
isn't a man,</i>

37:13.815 --> 37:17.934
<i>they do whatever it takes
to help women.</i>

37:32.417 --> 37:35.080
If your intent is to tell
our people those lies,

37:35.920 --> 37:37.206
then I'm sorry,

37:38.256 --> 37:39.872
but that's not gonna happen.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.880
If your intent
was to double-cross me,

37:43.970 --> 37:46.257
you missed a key
plot point, shit-crisp.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.848
I'm a fuckin' magician.

37:55.690 --> 37:59.354
<i>There's a storm
on the way</i>

37:59.444 --> 38:01.401
<i>All right</i>

38:01.488 --> 38:07.701
<i>There's a storm on the way</i>

38:11.581 --> 38:14.289
<i>And it's coming
no matter what I say</i>

38:16.586 --> 38:17.918
<i>There's truth in the thunder</i>

38:18.087 --> 38:19.419
<i>There's love in the lightning</i>

38:19.506 --> 38:20.713
<i>The feeling is frightening</i>

38:20.799 --> 38:22.461
<i>But isn't it exciting?</i>

38:22.550 --> 38:24.337
<i>I'm something
like stormy weather</i>

38:24.427 --> 38:27.670
<i>If I weren't, we'd never
huddle together</i>

38:27.764 --> 38:28.880
<i>Do I have to tell you</i>

38:28.973 --> 38:31.886
<i>That I'm also the sunlight
that shines shortly after?</i>

38:31.976 --> 38:33.888
<i>I just rain 'cause I have to</i>

38:33.978 --> 38:36.470
<i>On to another chapter,
I wish you lots of laughter</i>

38:36.564 --> 38:38.476
<i>Till the next time you see me</i>

38:38.566 --> 38:44.437
<i>Just remember you need me,
I'm the storm coming</i>

38:44.531 --> 38:46.022
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

38:46.115 --> 38:49.404
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

38:49.494 --> 38:51.030
<i>So here I come,
I come, I come</i>

38:51.120 --> 38:52.452
No...

38:52.872 --> 38:56.741
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

38:57.210 --> 38:58.701
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

38:58.795 --> 39:00.286
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

39:00.380 --> 39:01.791
<i>I wish you lots of laughter</i>

39:01.881 --> 39:03.463
<i>Till the next time
you see me</i>

39:03.550 --> 39:04.882
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

39:04.968 --> 39:06.709
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

39:09.597 --> 39:11.589
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

39:11.683 --> 39:14.426
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

39:14.519 --> 39:17.683
<i>So here I come,
I come, I come</i>

39:17.772 --> 39:19.308
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

39:19.399 --> 39:20.890
<i>Come on</i>

39:20.984 --> 39:24.068
<i>Here I come, I come, I come</i>

39:24.153 --> 39:27.442
<i>Don't ask why</i>

39:27.532 --> 39:29.398
<i>Just live</i>

39:29.492 --> 39:32.985
<i>And die</i>

39:43.464 --> 39:45.000
Aren't you gonna
use the axes?

39:45.091 --> 39:46.207
No.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.796
Tell the spirits
to exit your husband.

39:49.596 --> 39:52.009
They serve you...
All of you.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.840
Come on, ladies.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.641
It's time to get your head
out of the sand... Literally.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.306
Close your eyes.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.888
Think the thought,
"Leave my husband."

40:15.288 --> 40:17.951
She's talking to me.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.252
From now on, if a demon
possesses a man or a woman,

40:23.338 --> 40:24.829
you can just
tell them to leave.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.747
Or stay and finish them off.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.666
Or help with the laundry.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.459
They're pretty handy.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.015
Hey.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.567
This isn't over.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.523
Yes, it is.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.072
No, it's not.

40:50.615 --> 40:54.700
I'm gonna figure out whatever
the hell this, uh, binder's all about

40:54.786 --> 40:56.778
and become a goddess again.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.530
Okay, that's not
gonna make a difference.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.832
Well, yeah, there's a ton
of reasons it won't,

41:01.918 --> 41:03.534
but when has
that stopped us?

41:04.128 --> 41:06.836
Look, once I finally get this
goddess shit straight...

41:07.924 --> 41:08.924
I need you...

41:11.219 --> 41:13.711
To help remind me
what it's like to give a shit

41:13.805 --> 41:14.966
about other people,

41:15.974 --> 41:18.717
to want to risk
your life to save them.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.524
I got it.

41:33.950 --> 41:35.657
May I come in?

41:42.125 --> 41:43.411
Look who's up.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.333
Trump and Aunt Lydia.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.710
Welcome to the
New Desert Order.

41:47.797 --> 41:49.538
It's gonna suck for you.

41:53.720 --> 41:59.933
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

42:00.018 --> 42:04.103
<i>Queen of my song</i>

42:06.691 --> 42:12.813
<i>List' while I woo thee</i>

42:12.905 --> 42:19.243

<i>Gone are the cares of</i>

42:26.627 --> 42:30.712

42:31.340 --> 42:33.047
Nice song, asshole.

42:33.301 --> 42:37.011
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

42:37.388 --> 42:42.099
<i>Awake unto me</i>

42:46.064 --> 42:50.525
Look, I know you're just
a reptilian hallucination.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.772
But I miss you...

42:58.284 --> 43:00.071
So much.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.575
And I promise you...

43:06.167 --> 43:08.079
I'm gonna get you back.

43:22.600 --> 43:28.972
