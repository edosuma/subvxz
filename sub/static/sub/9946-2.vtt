Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:06.920 --> 00:08.839
Come and watch pikeys

00:08.840 --> 00:12.839
making a mess of the lives
they were given by 'im upstairs.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.879
And kids they're
convinced aren't actually theirs.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.919
Stay away!

00:18.920 --> 00:22.279
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.280 --> 00:25.599
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.600 --> 00:28.759
Cos' this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.760 --> 00:32.759
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.879
To calm us all down,
to stop us going mental.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.879
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.359
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.680 --> 00:49.679
You shit on our heads
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.360 --> 00:56.799
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers,

00:56.800 --> 00:59.239
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.919
Make poverty history!

01:00.920 --> 01:03.439
Cheaper drugs now!

01:03.440 --> 01:07.439
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

Discussion groups, chat lines,

01:19.480 --> 01:23.479
The new millennium, the age of the
all-vocalising, all-emoting fuck-up.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.399
Normal men and women spewing the
contents of their troubled souls

01:29.400 --> 01:32.919
into the ears of the uninterested,
excreting the sorry waste of their

01:32.920 --> 01:36.919
emotional innards
into all manner of public places.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.599
Pubs, telly, newspapers.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.719
If only they'd zip it and heed their
inner voice, the one that never lies.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.919
The one that screams at
you at the dead of night. Oh, aye.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.919
'Tis better to remain silent and
be thought a repressed old fart than

01:56.000 --> 01:59.999
open one's mouth and be discovered
a babblin', self-obsessed fool.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.359
Where his family's concerned,

02:07.360 --> 02:09.679
Paddy Maguire's never been
less than generous.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.759
But a 50 grand blow
would knock any man.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.119
Mam. Settlement.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.919
She set the business up with me,

02:16.920 --> 02:19.399
so it's only fair
she should get half the spoils.

02:19.400 --> 02:23.399
But memories of our time together
aren't going to keep me comfy in my
old age.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.199
I need to make serious hay now.
There's a recession on,
so people are what?

02:27.200 --> 02:28.239
Skint.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.239
So they borrow money. Then what?

02:29.240 --> 02:30.279
So they borrow money. Then what?
Can't pay it back.

02:30.280 --> 02:34.279
And when these desperados want to
forget what monumental fuck-ups their
lives have become, they do what?

02:35.520 --> 02:36.239
Get off their heads.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.999
Get off their heads.
Drug sales soar.
Economic gloom equals a pay-day boom!

02:40.000 --> 02:43.399
And I want you in on it.
I want Manchester to know

02:43.400 --> 02:45.479
that Maguire & Sons
are back in business.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.839
Not for me, Dad.Not for...

02:46.840 --> 02:47.759
Count me in.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.279
Count me in.
Hang on, what do you mean?

02:49.280 --> 02:51.439
We could make a killing!
What are you on about?

02:51.440 --> 02:52.999
I've got a family.
Good of you to remember.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.239
I've got Karen and
Connor to think of now!

02:54.240 --> 02:56.639
I've got Karen and
Connor to think of now!
You're barely scraping a living!

02:56.640 --> 02:58.199
At least I'm not watching me back
all the fuckin' time.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.799
At least I'm not watching me back
all the fuckin' time.
And what about you?I'm in, Dad.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.719
You still in possession of the
bollocks you were born with?

03:01.720 --> 03:03.959
You still in possession of the
bollocks you were born with?
Dad, I'm OK with moody weddings.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.679
Oh, you're settling for OK?

03:05.680 --> 03:06.719
I'm in.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.159
Never thought I'd see the day.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.159
Sons of mine, gutless, pussy-whipped.
There's more loyalty in those little

03:12.240 --> 03:14.159
rats I pay to sell the gear
on the estate.

03:14.160 --> 03:14.999
Look, Dad...

03:15.000 --> 03:15.599
Look, Dad...
Get out, all of you.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.639
Look, Dad...
Get out, all of you.
I wouldn't mind...

03:16.640 --> 03:20.159
Go on, out!

03:20.160 --> 03:24.159
Fuck off!

03:30.320 --> 03:31.799
You did say no?

03:31.800 --> 03:32.959
Course I said no.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.839
You sound like you're sorry for him.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.439
I am his son.

03:38.440 --> 03:42.439
Yeah, and he's yours.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.919
Oh, what?

03:48.360 --> 03:52.359
"Wooh! I'm going to be the best
dressed baby in Chatsworth! Yay!"

03:53.440 --> 03:56.519
Christ, Karen, a 150 quid?

03:56.520 --> 03:58.999
For him to puke all over it?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.999
Get it back, get a refund.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.119
Hello?
I'd like to place an order, please.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.599
Christ, Carl! Watch where you're
putting it! That was trap two!

04:40.520 --> 04:43.319
I was the only one
willing to go along with Dad.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.519
He totally blanked me.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.919
That's cos you're an ideas person,
like him.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.039
A thinker, cerebral.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.399
More brains than a
service station pastie.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.399
Now, eh, those balloons aren't going
to blow themselves up, are they?

04:59.680 --> 05:02.879
I mean, I'm an inspired shag, me.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.399
But bum sex?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.039
Why would he want to do that?

05:06.040 --> 05:08.559
You should ask him how he'd like it.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.799
Mm!

05:09.800 --> 05:13.799
About Sunday. We're welcoming
our little man into God's family.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.599
It's a celebration, yes,
but it's a holy day.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.159
So any talk of whoring
or crack pipes is right off. Yeah?

05:22.160 --> 05:23.559
I'll see you later.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.839
See you later, Max. I think
I can manage that for you, Mimi.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.239
Oh, and if you think I'm cocking up
on me godmum duties,

05:30.240 --> 05:32.719
I'm sure you won't
hesitate to pull me.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.719
Oh, there's nothing to worry about
there. Because Concepta, my cousin,

05:36.720 --> 05:39.199
she's godmum now.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.319
What?

05:40.320 --> 05:44.279
With the dancing and touring,poor
love never got chance to havekids.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.399
So I thought it'd
be nice for her to have

05:46.400 --> 05:48.519
a little one she can be close to.

05:48.520 --> 05:52.519
You don't begrudge her
having a godson, do you?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.279
Heard the latest from your mother?

05:58.280 --> 06:00.519
Me and you
have been dumped as godparents,

06:00.520 --> 06:03.559
cos her cousin and her bloke
are a more glamorous option.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.519
No, it's just you who's been dumped.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.119
Concepta ain't got a bloke.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.359
You're still godfather?

06:09.360 --> 06:11.919
She only...
Uh, she only told me this morning.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.759
And what was your reaction when
mummy dearest hit you with that one?

06:14.760 --> 06:17.279
And what was your reaction when
mummy dearest hit you with that one?
I'm... I'm not arsed, Kel.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.919
Your girlfriend gets shat on
from a great height by your mother

06:20.920 --> 06:22.559
and you're not arsed?

06:22.560 --> 06:26.519
That's not what I meant! Kel!

06:26.520 --> 06:30.199
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oops-a-daisy.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.879
Really looking forward to Sunday.

06:31.880 --> 06:35.639
Be nice to have all the
family under one roof again.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.279
I think it's time we settled up.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.439
For the christening? Come on, 50-50.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.959
Paddy, honest, I'm really flush.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.679
Paddy, honest, I'm really flush.
Mimi, chuck yourself
under the King's horse,

06:44.680 --> 06:47.119
gaze at your chuff in a mirror,
but please,

06:47.120 --> 06:49.759
in the spirit of equality,
tell me what I owe.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.759
OK, you win. 500.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.199
You only do it once, don't you?

06:56.200 --> 07:00.199
I'll fetch it for you right away.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.839
Dad?

07:03.840 --> 07:06.159
Why don't you just help him collect?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.359
God knows,
you could do with the readies.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.199
God knows,
you could do with the readies.
I've told you why.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.919
Well, if not to boost your income,
then to keep an eye out for him.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.839
You know better than anyone
what it's like out there.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.839
You know better than anyone
what it's like out there.
Dad's covered.
Got some lads helping him out.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.879
Has he bollocks! What's he
going to pay them with, Jamie?

07:20.880 --> 07:24.879
There's more brass on a string
quartet than on your dad just now.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.519
Think about it.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.559
No!

07:27.560 --> 07:31.559
Now can we just leave it, please?

07:34.600 --> 07:37.719
30 grams of coke, 100 of cannabis.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.999
I'll be expecting two grand back.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.999
Anything you make on top is yours.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.719
Problem?

07:46.720 --> 07:49.079
How are we supposed to make owt
on that?Get creative.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.559
So, besides hiking up the costs

07:51.560 --> 07:54.799
or mixing the gear, have you got
any other creative suggestions?

07:54.800 --> 07:58.799
People ain't thick. They know what
they want and how much it costs.

08:04.040 --> 08:08.039
All right, all right.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.479
1,800.

08:12.480 --> 08:16.479
Make it quick
if you value your kneecaps.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.839
We've been over this.
He's wearing that one.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.279
We've been over this.
He's wearing that one.
Cos you've got to
keep your mother sweet.

08:26.280 --> 08:30.279
She's paying for everything
because you managed to spend
every penny I put aside.

08:32.799 --> 08:36.318
For when he starts on solids.
It's the business. Anyway,

08:36.320 --> 08:39.639
you can take that look off your
face cos I know what you're thinking.

08:39.640 --> 08:43.639
"It's all about Connor now."

08:49.280 --> 08:53.279
Better to spend 200 on something
and wear it 100 times, than 30 quid
and only wear it once.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.519
Jamie, it's not every
day your first born's...

09:00.040 --> 09:04.039
Karen? Karen?!

09:09.360 --> 09:10.279
What is it, what's wrong?

09:10.280 --> 09:11.639
What is it, what's wrong?
What's going on?

09:11.640 --> 09:14.879
Karen!

09:14.880 --> 09:17.319
What is it?
What are you looking for?

09:17.320 --> 09:21.319
Karen. What's going on?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.359
The baby.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.559
Where is he?

09:25.560 --> 09:29.559
When's the last time
you had him, Karen?!

09:30.000 --> 09:33.999
Mum, get upstairs! Check, quick!

09:35.280 --> 09:39.279
Connor...

09:41.240 --> 09:45.239
Shane, Mickey! Connor's missing!
I'll check the shops,

09:45.440 --> 09:48.399
check the bus stop, tell
everyone you see he's missing!

09:48.400 --> 09:52.399
Get Carl, Ian, fuckin' everyone!
Find him, Mickey!

09:54.600 --> 09:57.639
Aw, come on!

09:57.640 --> 10:01.199
Carl I need your...

10:01.200 --> 10:05.199
I need your help when you've...
finished.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.599
You stupid...

10:18.600 --> 10:20.399
Leave the girl alone!

10:20.400 --> 10:22.319
How the fuck do you forget
where you leave your own son?!

10:22.320 --> 10:26.319
Do you think she really
needs telling, Jamie?!

10:29.400 --> 10:30.879
BABY GURGLES

10:30.880 --> 10:32.159
Oh, thank God!

10:32.160 --> 10:33.199
Oh, Joe, thank fuck!

10:33.200 --> 10:35.879
Said she'd only be five minutes.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.279
Asked me to take him while
she popped into Yvonne's.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.799
Everyone was smoking in there.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.799
My mobile goes, I'm yapping away,
I turn around and she's gone.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.359
I forgot...

10:46.360 --> 10:48.079
I forgot.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.439
Be the excitement of
the christening and that.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.519
Ah, cheers, Joe.

10:52.520 --> 10:53.959
Drink?

10:53.960 --> 10:57.959
No, I'm driving. Thanks anyway.
Later, yeah?

10:59.160 --> 11:01.879
Delivery, mate.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.879
I'm sorry.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.139
I'm just off to pick up t'cake.

11:11.140 --> 11:15.139
Running errands for the bitch
that's coming between us.
What sort of servile cretin are you?

11:15.620 --> 11:18.979
I'd like you to watch your mouth.
And I'd like you to keep
your nose out of our business.

11:18.980 --> 11:20.059
She's not coming between us.

11:20.060 --> 11:23.819
She is. And she's doing it
by running me down.

11:23.820 --> 11:26.499
And you're no innocent bystander.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.019
You're her fuckin' accomplice!

11:29.020 --> 11:30.739
He's running a family errand.

11:30.740 --> 11:34.739
To fetch a cake for a baptism that
I should have been godmother at.

11:34.740 --> 11:35.739
She didn't mean anything personal.

11:35.740 --> 11:39.419
It's easy for you to say. You're
not the one who's been shafted.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.419
Do you want me to tell her
I can't be godfather no more?

11:41.420 --> 11:45.419
Do you want me to tell her
I can't be godfather no more?
I want you to fight my corner!

11:50.900 --> 11:54.899
You've no idea, have you? The effect
this had on me, how touched I was,

11:54.900 --> 11:58.899
how it made me feel that Karen and
Jamie thought that I was good enough
to be godmother to their son.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.739
I was walking on air!

12:03.740 --> 12:06.699
And I wanted to do it right,

12:06.700 --> 12:08.459
do Connor proud.

12:08.460 --> 12:12.379
Not just turn up,
hold the kid by the font
and then get hammered at the do

12:12.380 --> 12:15.339
like every other godparent
I have ever come across!

12:15.340 --> 12:19.339
OK, you want it sorted?
I'll sort it.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.619
I didn't do it to hurt Kelly, son.
I did it to protect her.

12:30.860 --> 12:34.019
She probably can't bless herself
right, never mind reel off the Creed.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.499
I don't think I can any more.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.459
More the need for Concepta, then.

12:38.460 --> 12:41.699
She's blood. She'll always be around.

12:41.700 --> 12:45.699
I hate to say this, but what if Kelly
traps off with some loaded punter?

12:47.020 --> 12:51.019
Any one of us could fuck off
at any time. You and Dad split up.

12:51.380 --> 12:55.259
Yeah. But we've got responsibilities
that bind us forever more.

12:55.260 --> 12:58.059
Apart from the dollop of lust
and love, you two have nothin'.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.779
Apart from the dollop of lust
and love, you two have nothin'.
What are you getting out of this?

12:59.780 --> 13:03.059
You've got loads of godkids you
never even see, so you know
it's a load of shit.

13:03.060 --> 13:05.819
Your beloved
write those lines, did she?

13:05.820 --> 13:09.819
I've had enough of you and my dad
trying to run my life,
trying to fuck things up for me.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.619
I'm not your little boy any more.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.939
And I'm telling you right now,

13:17.940 --> 13:21.939
back off.

13:25.820 --> 13:28.339
You OK now?

13:28.340 --> 13:32.339
Embarrassed, more than anything.

13:32.340 --> 13:33.339
I'm sorry.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.899
Yeah, so am I.

13:34.900 --> 13:38.179
My head's done in, with everything.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.779
Hey, just think.

13:39.780 --> 13:43.779
After the christening,
it's all over.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.459
No need to thank me.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.139
Fuck...off.

14:06.140 --> 14:10.139
Right, before I do, there's something
I'd like to get off me chest.
Jamie, mate!

14:12.220 --> 14:15.419
Let's let Jamie in
on our little secret.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.299
Oh, cheer up, Karen.
Confession's good for the soul.

14:18.300 --> 14:19.539
He'll kill you.

14:19.540 --> 14:20.699
I'm ready for him this time.

14:20.700 --> 14:21.659
He won't believe you.

14:21.660 --> 14:25.659
He won't believe you.
Oh, so he hasn't noticed
the mole between your tits or the
birthmark on your left arse cheek?

14:27.140 --> 14:31.139
Or the way you dig your nails into
the back of his neck when you come?

14:32.500 --> 14:36.499
Something you should know.

14:38.620 --> 14:40.459
Your mam's invited me to Sunday's do.

14:40.460 --> 14:44.459
I've heard the delivery nurse
is always at Maguire christenings.
Just checking that's cool with you.

14:45.020 --> 14:49.019
Yeah, well you've been there
twice for the little fella.
How could I say no?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.459
See you later.

14:50.460 --> 14:54.459
Yeah.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.939
What's that?

15:12.940 --> 15:16.939
This is Back-Door Bertie.
Our mutual fuck buddy.

15:17.180 --> 15:20.659
Yeah, right.
Well, he can fuck off.

15:20.660 --> 15:23.779
I thought you wanted to indulge
in a little dark star penetration?

15:23.780 --> 15:27.779
I do, but... But that? There's no
pleasure for you sticking that in me.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.779
Well, maybe not,
but you might love it.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.899
An' I'm all about giving, me.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.899
Imagine, the pair of us casting
off our arse innocence together.

15:37.900 --> 15:41.899
What could be more romantic
and binding?

15:42.420 --> 15:46.419
I promise I'll be gentle, Carl.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.299
You're certainly in the minority.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.539
Bet hardly any straight blokes
take it.

15:54.540 --> 15:57.859
I dunno. What's the difference
between a straight man and a gay man?

15:57.860 --> 15:59.699
Six cans of lager.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.899
I'm not taking, I'm just...
Considering possibilities.

16:02.900 --> 16:05.619
If you're thinking it,
you're halfway there.

16:05.620 --> 16:08.699
Yeah, well, me and Max are tight.
And what's good for the goose...

16:08.700 --> 16:10.979
What advice would you give
your little brother, Ian?

16:10.980 --> 16:13.819
Absolutely fuckin' none.
I'm not talking bum sex with him!

16:13.820 --> 16:16.219
Be different
if it was pussy though.

16:16.220 --> 16:20.219
I tell you what, once you've made
contact with Mr G spot, you'll kill
yourself for not hooking up sooner.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.139
Don't it hurt, though?

16:23.140 --> 16:26.419
Well, you can't do the full monty
straight off.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.099
You've got to work up to it.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.699
You've got to work up to it.
How?

16:28.700 --> 16:31.979
Well, start small
and plenty of lube.

16:31.980 --> 16:33.339
Lubrication.

16:33.340 --> 16:36.579
Bit of spit always does it for me
if I'm ever caught short.

16:36.580 --> 16:40.579
Just let your mind open up
to the possibilities
and your arse'll follow.

16:40.860 --> 16:44.179
And you're a Catholic, yeah,
like me?

16:44.180 --> 16:47.419
So the guilt'll just add to
the sheer thrill of it all.

16:47.420 --> 16:51.419
So, to recap,
you start small, work your way up.

16:54.900 --> 16:58.899
(BARKS)

17:07.020 --> 17:10.019
I fucking hate dogs. Little
disease-spreading shit machines!

17:10.020 --> 17:11.378
Karen.

17:11.380 --> 17:15.378
You look tired. Come on.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.499
Living over a pub's hardly peaceful.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.499
And I know Mimi's decibel level
isn't always within legal limits.

17:27.900 --> 17:31.899
Here.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.579
My place.

17:34.580 --> 17:37.659
It can be your little oasis.

17:37.660 --> 17:40.579
I want to help, Karen.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.219
Let's face it,

17:42.220 --> 17:46.219
I'm the nearest thing you've got
to a dad and you're the nearest
thing I've got to a daughter now.

18:40.220 --> 18:44.219
Shit!

18:52.700 --> 18:55.899
If that's my consolation prize,
you can stick it up your arse.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.699
I tried my best, Kel.
Just seems like she's not having it.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.819
She say why?
Yeah, the religion thing.

19:01.820 --> 19:05.819
You know and I know,
the reason she gave me the elbow
is cos she can't stand a low-down.

19:08.860 --> 19:10.419
Me, being in the limelight.

19:10.420 --> 19:13.179
Don't think you've got
any fears there, Kelly.

19:13.180 --> 19:16.899
In the New Testament,
Matthew never condemns prostitution.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.899
Turning to the Old Testament,
in the book of Hosea, God says

19:21.580 --> 19:25.219
he'd never punish the daughters
of Israel for selling themselves.

19:25.220 --> 19:29.219
And besides, you're a masseuse.

19:36.380 --> 19:40.379
How could ya? If you didn't want him
wearing it, you could've just said.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.259
What's going on?

19:42.260 --> 19:44.339
Look what she did!

19:44.340 --> 19:48.339
Her, who I've treated
like me own daughter.

19:48.460 --> 19:49.619
I ironed it.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.779
Sorry, I didn't even notice.

19:52.780 --> 19:56.779
You didn't want Connor wearing it
and thought if you ruined it,
he wouldn't have to!

19:56.820 --> 19:59.819
Mimi, I can assure you, I would
never do something like that.

19:59.820 --> 20:03.819
This was my grandmother's,
an' her mother before that.

20:05.020 --> 20:08.419
The names of my dead babies
are woven into it.

20:08.420 --> 20:12.419
It was an accident.

20:14.460 --> 20:17.659
DOOR SLAMS

20:17.660 --> 20:20.659
You don't believe me now? What sort
of a mad bitch do you think I am?

20:20.660 --> 20:21.859
I'm beginning to wonder.

20:21.860 --> 20:24.059
Right.

20:24.060 --> 20:25.339
I'll sort it.

20:25.340 --> 20:28.939
I'll fucking sort it!

20:28.940 --> 20:32.939
I will sort it!

20:35.580 --> 20:39.579
RIPS

20:41.660 --> 20:45.659
The mark's do-able, but the tear...

20:46.980 --> 20:49.979
But with it being crocheted,
we should be able to hide it nicely.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.459
Brilliant.

20:51.460 --> 20:55.459
Problem is, this is Irish crochet
and I only do the filet.

20:55.860 --> 20:58.619
But my sister-in-law Mary
is good at the Irish, mind.

20:58.620 --> 21:02.499
But the silk thread
don't come cheap.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.579
KNOCK ON DOOR

21:04.580 --> 21:06.499
Shit!

21:06.500 --> 21:07.339
Get me out of here!

21:07.340 --> 21:08.899
Get me out of here!
In there.

21:08.900 --> 21:12.259
Just a minute. >

21:12.260 --> 21:15.019
Hi, Mimi. Come in.

21:15.020 --> 21:16.379
What can I do for you, love?

21:16.380 --> 21:19.819
Well, I'm not here to have me clit
flicked. Need a word with Kelly.

21:19.820 --> 21:23.819
Oh, she's tied up just now.

21:24.620 --> 21:28.459
I've had a word with Paddy and Shane
and they had a thing or two to say.

21:28.460 --> 21:31.259
And I've decided to rethink
the whole godmother thing.

21:31.260 --> 21:34.899
Concepta's sound but, on balance,
I feel your case is stronger.

21:34.900 --> 21:36.139
What?

21:36.140 --> 21:40.139
You're more grounded.
Even when she isn't high,
her head's still in the clouds.

21:40.180 --> 21:41.979
And you only live round the corner.

21:41.980 --> 21:45.819
If a crisis strikes, what good's she
propping up the Waldorf bar?

21:45.820 --> 21:49.819
An' despite having more male
customers than Burton's, I feel
your heart's in the right place.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.499
You'll do for me.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.459
Deal?

21:54.460 --> 21:58.459
Deal.

21:59.260 --> 22:03.259
See ya.

22:12.620 --> 22:14.139
Get out.

22:14.140 --> 22:18.139
What sort of a welcome's that, eh?

22:35.180 --> 22:37.699
She once told me that her...

22:37.700 --> 22:41.699
..that her big dream was to go
skinny-dipping at night in Crete.

22:44.060 --> 22:48.059
I kept her messages on me mobile
so I can hear her voice.

23:01.060 --> 23:05.059
(SOBS)

23:25.700 --> 23:28.179
If there's yellow stuff in it,
it's not cancer.

23:28.180 --> 23:30.379
I put sweet corn in that pasta dish.

23:30.380 --> 23:33.459
I were trying out some brown-eye
action with a party blower.

23:33.460 --> 23:36.539
But when I took it out,
the nozzle got stuck.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.779
I can't get it out. Will you try?

23:37.780 --> 23:41.779
Ooooh! Sorry, Carl,
anal extractions didn't feature
on my auxiliary training course.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.179
You don't need a qualification
to work out what's got to be done!

23:46.180 --> 23:48.379
No, but you do need equipment.

23:48.380 --> 23:51.539
Didn't fancy wasting me
whole Friday night in A&E,

23:51.540 --> 23:53.179
Whoa, we're not going there!

23:53.180 --> 23:57.179
They won't bat an eyelid.
Had a vicar in last week,
he had a 12-inch candle up him.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.379
Said he fell backwards putting
up curtains! You're nowt special.

24:00.380 --> 24:03.259
Said he fell backwards putting
up curtains! You're nowt special.
I'm not going, Max.

24:03.260 --> 24:03.819
PARTY BLOWER SQUEAKS

24:03.820 --> 24:07.819
What was that?

24:09.460 --> 24:12.099
Any bit of wind an' it goes off.

24:12.100 --> 24:15.299
It's like having
an internal mouth organ.

24:15.300 --> 24:19.299
Hey, Carl,
give us a tune before you go.

24:25.060 --> 24:29.059
How much was lifted?

24:33.900 --> 24:37.899
OK, OK. I'll be right with you.

24:51.420 --> 24:55.419
Just what I fucking need!

24:55.980 --> 24:59.979
FRONT DOOR CLOSES

25:11.060 --> 25:15.059
I love you.

25:17.700 --> 25:19.459
Don't fuck up!

25:19.460 --> 25:23.459
I won't.

25:28.180 --> 25:30.899
Who the fuck am I?

25:30.900 --> 25:33.219
Who the...fuck...am I?

25:33.220 --> 25:35.979
Mr Maguire, Mr Maguire!

25:35.980 --> 25:38.739
So why are you treating me like
Bill Gates or bloody Carnegie?

25:38.740 --> 25:42.179
You're a charity case all right,
but not one I'm supporting.

25:42.180 --> 25:46.179
So, where the fuck's my money?

25:50.380 --> 25:53.339
As it's small, a little
irrigation'll budge it.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.499
As me vac's being serviced anyway.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.619
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

25:57.620 --> 26:00.339
Every other day
I do a rectal removal.

26:00.340 --> 26:04.339
I dislodge, I douche, I dab some
talc, and I return it to its wife.

26:04.460 --> 26:07.379
Come on, Carl. Drop 'em.

26:07.380 --> 26:08.459
Ready?

26:08.460 --> 26:12.459
SQUELCH

26:17.460 --> 26:19.059
Do I look stupid?

26:19.060 --> 26:21.699
He's out getting the rest now.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.499
There are some people in this world

26:23.500 --> 26:27.499
who learn their lessons well,
take on board advice, move on

26:27.500 --> 26:31.059
and have relatively happy lives.
And there are those that don't.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.619
You are obviously of the latter.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.339
Fuck you!

26:34.340 --> 26:36.779
You don't scare me!
I know people.

26:36.780 --> 26:39.619
And once you're out of intensive
care, you go see those people and

26:39.620 --> 26:41.259
ask them if they know Paddy Maguire!

26:41.260 --> 26:45.259
I guarantee they will.

26:45.940 --> 26:47.499
You've got...

26:47.500 --> 26:51.499
GUNSHOT

27:12.640 --> 27:13.759
How's my favourite bum boy?

27:13.760 --> 27:16.799
Last time I was slipping your
Chrissy one, she said he was fine.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.639
Paddy through there?

27:17.640 --> 27:19.119
No, I'll give him a bell.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.479
Been ringing him for ages,
just keeps ringing out.

27:21.480 --> 27:25.479
Yeah.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.839
Two minutes, yeah?

27:31.360 --> 27:32.359
Cheers, son.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.079
Is me dad here?

27:34.080 --> 27:35.159
Nipped out for the papers.

27:35.160 --> 27:39.159
On a Saturday morning there's
nothing that Mr Maguire and I like
more than to talk current affairs

27:40.240 --> 27:41.439
over a pot of Lady Grey.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.879
Really?

27:42.880 --> 27:46.879
Is he fuck here.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.559
Sean's here with the
delivery and Dad's not in.

27:52.560 --> 27:53.639
You got three grand in the safe?

27:53.640 --> 27:55.879
Do I look like a man who's
got three grand in the safe?

27:55.880 --> 27:58.679
You can set your watch by Sean.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.279
Every Saturday at 12.
Dad never misses him.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.119
There's definitely something up.

28:03.120 --> 28:06.239
Pint of the darkstuff please,
Jamie.

28:06.240 --> 28:10.239
Three grand, me tips.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.039
Karen all right?

28:13.040 --> 28:15.279
Not every day you forget
where your kid is, eh?

28:15.280 --> 28:16.599
You weren't laughing the other day.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.839
Nah ,she's fine.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.039
And that is on the house.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.199
Good, so long as
the baby blues haven't struck.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.719
She's just tired, that's all.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.519
We both are.

28:27.520 --> 28:31.079
Having a baby in the house
really takes it out of you.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.679
Mate of mine said that him and his
missus are that knackered at the end
of the day,

28:34.680 --> 28:36.279
all they're fit for in bed is sleep.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.199
Your love life's out the window,
you're skint all the time,

28:39.200 --> 28:42.119
strain was unbelievable.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.639
Hey, but listen, he didn't have

28:43.640 --> 28:46.319
what you and Karen have got,
d'you know what I mean, mate?Jamie?

28:46.320 --> 28:50.319
Yes, mate.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.799
Here's the rascal.
You wanna keep it?

28:52.800 --> 28:53.279
Pass.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.399
Should have it framed. Once
it's been disinfected, obviously.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.879
Health freaks would pay hundreds
for this treatment.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.159
If you know any, tell
them I'll do it cheaper.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.159
Cheers, Lillian.

29:02.160 --> 29:06.159
It was all my pleasure.

29:09.640 --> 29:10.999
I underestimated you.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.039
How?

29:12.040 --> 29:16.039
Never thought for a second you'd ever
really consider being my bum chum.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.479
So, how can I make it up to you?

29:22.480 --> 29:26.199
You can have anything you like.

29:26.200 --> 29:30.199
(FARTS)

29:41.720 --> 29:45.079
(KNOCKS)

29:45.080 --> 29:49.079
You OK?

29:55.200 --> 29:57.279
We'll have to make a bit of
"us" time, won't we?

29:57.280 --> 30:01.279
We're more than just Mum and Dad.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.639
Let's have a night out, eh?

30:05.640 --> 30:07.759
Too much effort.

30:07.760 --> 30:11.679
By the time we've booked a table,
and found a sitter, done the feeds,

30:11.680 --> 30:15.599
got his clothes sorted for
the next day, got meself sorted,

30:15.600 --> 30:17.279
all I'm fit for is bed.

30:17.280 --> 30:21.279
Things'll get better, yeah?

30:25.960 --> 30:26.999
I'm sorry.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.519
I'm not complaining.

30:30.520 --> 30:34.519
You and Connor are my world now.

30:35.880 --> 30:39.839
If anything happened,

30:39.840 --> 30:43.839
if anything damaged us,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.999
I don't know what I'd do.

30:49.400 --> 30:53.359
Hey, nothing is gonna damage us.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.359
All right?

30:59.880 --> 31:02.159
Dad, it's Micky.

31:02.160 --> 31:06.159
Give us a bell, yeah?

31:07.920 --> 31:11.599
Peace offering.
You know where the bar is.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.479
I knew you said you'd sort it,
but I didn't fancy your odds.

31:14.480 --> 31:18.479
You know what, you lot probably
mock those South Sea islanders,

31:19.920 --> 31:23.199
with bones through their noses,
performing their shaman rituals.

31:23.200 --> 31:27.199
When, in fact, you are partaking
in exactly the same bollocks.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.639
About tomorrow, Frank,
a verbal invite, do ya?

31:33.640 --> 31:36.839
Be nice to see you there
for Katie's sake. Free bar.

31:36.840 --> 31:40.479
Oh, thanks Mimi, love, yeah
I'll try and show me face.

31:40.480 --> 31:44.479
But what I was about to say, is,

31:44.600 --> 31:48.599
that common myths bind us.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.279
Have either of you seen dad?

31:51.280 --> 31:52.719
Am I some kind of babysitter now?

31:52.720 --> 31:54.639
He's
big boy, he can look after himself.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.359
Help us look for him.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.959
Micky, you know your dad.
He'll be fine.

31:57.960 --> 32:01.959
Get yourself a drink, sit
yourself down and stop worrying.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.719
He won't thank you for it.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.159
What's up?

32:09.160 --> 32:12.999
Seriously, what's up?

32:13.000 --> 32:16.999
If he's as nice as you say he is
he won't mind helping, will he?

32:20.960 --> 32:23.039
Micky.
Long time no see.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.039
Ady.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.199
How are things with
you and the missus?

32:27.200 --> 32:31.199
It's all right, he's a fully paid up
member of the Uphill Shit Stabbers.

32:31.200 --> 32:35.199
It's over. I came home one day and
found herbang at it with the man
next door.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.519
Didn't think that'd bother ya.
Not after what we got up to.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.199
And the man over the road

32:40.200 --> 32:42.999
and the man at the back
and the man from next door but one.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.199
So you've left, then?

32:44.200 --> 32:47.919
Yeah, I've been living with
an interior designer from Cambodia.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.879
Can't string a sentence together,
but the flat looks fantastic

32:50.880 --> 32:54.879
and the things he can do with a wok
have to be seen to be believed.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.999
You should come round one night,
both of you.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.959
I'm here about my dad.
He's missing.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.399
Well, how long?

33:02.400 --> 33:03.279
About 12 hours.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.679
12 hours, I've been on
benders longer than that!

33:05.680 --> 33:09.479
He's never done this before. Ady,
please, look, this isn't like him.

33:09.480 --> 33:13.479
Something's happened, I know it,
and no fucker'll believe me and
you're my last hope.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.679
Please, Ady,

33:15.680 --> 33:17.879
you've gotta help us.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.559
Please...

33:19.560 --> 33:22.759
You're through to Paddy Maguire,
leave a message.

33:22.760 --> 33:26.279
Right and what should happen now is
the base station will flag up

33:26.280 --> 33:30.279
the phone's location. There we go.
There we go. Got ya!

33:32.000 --> 33:34.639
Dad it's me!Micky, Micky calm down.
Can you hear me?

33:34.640 --> 33:38.639
Paddy, Paddy.
I am going to radio for help.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.279
Thanks a million for finding him.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.919
That was down to Micky.

33:45.920 --> 33:49.919
He led the investigation.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.399
This is all down to me.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.839
Nah, it's not just you, Jamie.

33:57.840 --> 34:00.319
It's neither of you. No-one's fault.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.359
He knew the risks he was taking.

34:02.360 --> 34:05.679
He asked for our help
and we said no.

34:05.680 --> 34:09.679
We let him down, Mum.
All of us.

34:12.760 --> 34:16.759
Well, nearly all of us.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.559
Eating, sleeping.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.759
Right. Grub's up!

34:24.760 --> 34:26.958
You're pushing the boat out.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.159
Well, we won't get to eat till
the other side of the service so...

34:29.159 --> 34:33.159
There won't be a service.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.839
But this is Connor's big day.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.319
Yeah,
but not without my dad it isn't.

34:39.320 --> 34:43.319
We're cancelling.
Right, Mum?

34:44.719 --> 34:46.639
And how would we explain
that to wee Connor?

34:46.639 --> 34:50.639
All I need is a clean shirt
and I'll be with you.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.759
Patrick...

35:20.760 --> 35:24.759
it's time.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.359
You passed muster?

35:33.360 --> 35:36.679
Eventually.

35:36.680 --> 35:40.679
I believe in one God,
the Father, Almighty,

35:42.480 --> 35:46.479
maker of all things visible
and invisible.

35:51.080 --> 35:55.079
If you'd like to...

36:01.680 --> 36:05.679
I'm not sure if I can.

36:06.480 --> 36:10.239
It's just...

36:10.240 --> 36:12.439
I don't actually believe in God.

36:12.440 --> 36:16.439
But if I'm called on,
I'll teach him to respect people,

36:16.640 --> 36:20.639
no matter what they do
or don't believe in,
as long as they're decent.

36:20.920 --> 36:24.919
And I'll pray to a God I'm not
sure exists that he's loved.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.959
I'm a prostitute, Father.

36:29.960 --> 36:33.919
Ex junkie.
But I know good from bad.

36:33.920 --> 36:37.919
And if I can teach him that,
it's job done, really. Isn't it?

36:42.720 --> 36:45.559
I'm sorry if I've offended.

36:45.560 --> 36:48.559
I just don't want
to let Connor down.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.559
Or meself.

37:04.920 --> 37:08.919
Here, someone thought they were
very clever phoning Concepta,

37:09.680 --> 37:13.559
putting on a voice, telling her
that her flight had been cancelled.

37:13.560 --> 37:17.559
Only the thick fucking
prick of a prankster
forgot to withhold the number!

37:18.400 --> 37:22.399
Didn't you, Shane?!

37:29.720 --> 37:31.959
POP MUSIC PLAYS

37:31.960 --> 37:34.879
Word's been put out.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.879
Tell you what, whoever brings us
that kid is gonna be well flush.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.959
Who put the word out?

37:40.960 --> 37:43.719
Me, J, Shane.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.279
Well, you'd no fucking right.
I'm the director of Maguire Limited.

37:46.280 --> 37:49.199
I make the executive decisions.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.799
He's gonna pay for this, Dad.

37:50.800 --> 37:54.799
Risking your lives?
For what? For what?!

37:58.400 --> 38:01.679
No more of my cubs will die
on my account! Call it off.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.919
But he hurt you and they need
to know no-one does that
to our old man.

38:04.920 --> 38:08.919
Are you fuckin' deaf? Call it off!

38:17.600 --> 38:20.119
Hey, sexy.

38:20.120 --> 38:23.839
What happened to that Long Wet
Spicy Screw?

38:23.840 --> 38:25.999
Was just savouring the thought.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.799
Are those limes ready yet, babe?

38:28.800 --> 38:32.799
Ahhh.

38:35.520 --> 38:39.519
Is he any lighter now
he's washed of mortal sin?

38:42.720 --> 38:44.799
Didn't you fancy
jumping in yourself,

38:44.800 --> 38:47.239
taking a spiritual cleanse?

38:47.240 --> 38:50.039
You can't just turn up
and get christened, Frank.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.799
There is a program.Program!

38:52.800 --> 38:55.039
But what would be the point, eh?

38:55.040 --> 38:58.639
You'd only blot your copy book
the next day.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.519
You're like me, you are.

39:01.520 --> 39:05.519
Lured by earthly pleasures.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.519
How could you speak to
Micky like that, in public?

39:19.520 --> 39:23.519
The only one who you wouldn't invite
into the business, but the only one
who went out looking for you.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.959
Call yourself a father.

39:33.600 --> 39:37.599
Bang! Bang!

39:43.440 --> 39:46.639
I thought raspberries
were your favourite.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.799
Not when they're covered
in melted cow bone!

39:48.800 --> 39:52.799
The more I demanded,
the more she dug in!

39:53.680 --> 39:56.679
The call was a last resort.

39:56.680 --> 40:00.319
I just...I just
wanted to make it good.

40:00.320 --> 40:04.319
I want a man, Shane, a grown-up.

40:05.880 --> 40:09.879
But until I find one, suppose
I'll have to make do with you!

40:23.840 --> 40:26.879
Shit, I'm sorry!For fuck's sake!

40:26.880 --> 40:30.879
Why don't you go back to theloo
where you've come from,clean up?

40:34.280 --> 40:36.359
She's a slut.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.159
D'you know what?

40:38.160 --> 40:41.119
Paddy nearly died yesterday
and it woke me up to something.

40:41.120 --> 40:45.119
Life's too short. I'm not going to
waste my life waiting for you, Karen.

40:46.200 --> 40:50.199
You've got two men in your life.
Why can't I have two women?

40:54.080 --> 40:58.079
Look at that.
Looks like a platypus on safari.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.479
What the fuck did you just say?

41:04.480 --> 41:07.279
Nothing, Paddy.
A platypus on safari?!

41:07.280 --> 41:10.199
That's right,
run, you yellow-bellied gob-shite.

41:10.200 --> 41:14.199
Utter another word that's less than
kind, and I'll do what mother nature
should've done 50 years ago.

41:15.800 --> 41:19.799
I'll erase you for good!

41:29.920 --> 41:33.919
Nice one, Dad.
How do you think she's feeling now?

41:35.720 --> 41:39.479
Listen.You know something, Paddy,
you make the china shop bull

41:39.480 --> 41:41.519
look socially deft.

41:41.520 --> 41:45.519
I was protecting my family,
like any good father should.

41:47.440 --> 41:51.439
Is that so contemptible?

41:53.480 --> 41:57.479
If you don't tell mewhat you want,
I can't help you.
She's doing my head in.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.879
What's wrong with Katie now?

41:59.880 --> 42:03.879
The kiddies entertainer, the fella
you elbowed?With the broken nose?

42:03.960 --> 42:07.959
He won't be performing now.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.639
Once upon a time,

42:14.640 --> 42:18.639
there was a King
who lived in a mighty castle.

42:19.040 --> 42:23.039
He had all the things
a man could wish for.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.399
But he was a lonely King.

42:26.400 --> 42:30.399
That's right.
There was something missing.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.439
Are you with me so far?

42:33.440 --> 42:37.439
Then one day, he came
across a gorgeous young woman.

42:39.360 --> 42:43.359
And before too long,
they were madly, madly in love.

42:45.560 --> 42:49.559
And the gods blessed them
with beautiful children.

42:50.120 --> 42:54.119
And he and his Queen
loved them unconditionally.

42:55.320 --> 42:59.319
But the Queen grew bored
and looked to entertain herself.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.399
Live her own life.

43:02.400 --> 43:06.399
Without his family around him,
without their love, he floundered

43:07.520 --> 43:11.519
and he lost his crown.

43:12.480 --> 43:16.319
His daughter tried to...

43:16.320 --> 43:20.319
He lost his family
and he lost his Queen.

43:20.440 --> 43:24.439
He watched as his Queen
threw everything she had...

43:25.760 --> 43:27.319
they had...

43:27.320 --> 43:28.879
down the drain.

43:28.880 --> 43:32.279
She wanted him dead.

43:32.280 --> 43:36.279
Never thought that he might be in
need of some fucking assistance.

43:37.880 --> 43:41.159
Never thought that
he might be actually

43:41.160 --> 43:45.159
screaming out for some kind of help.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.359
All he was looking for
was someone...

43:49.360 --> 43:53.359
anyone...

43:54.360 --> 43:58.359
..to fucking listen!

44:03.000 --> 44:06.999
Just to fucking listen!

44:09.160 --> 44:13.159
That's all.

44:14.400 --> 44:18.399
That's all.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.359
Right,

44:38.360 --> 44:42.359
we're off to bed.

44:44.680 --> 44:48.679
Night, Mum.
