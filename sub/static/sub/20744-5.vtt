13:09.255 --> 13:11.257
Kadan, you have to
get ready, too.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.893
- I will, once you stop
hogging up the mirror.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.862
I'm a little nervous
about the judges.

13:15.862 --> 13:19.499
As long as my sister cooperates,

27:26.478 --> 27:27.513

27:27.513 --> 27:28.514
- My name is RAII.

It's time.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.654

27:35.654 --> 27:37.656

27:37.656 --> 27:38.901
- We both went to
the University of Illinois.

27:38.901 --> 27:39.258
- We both went to
the University of Illinois.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.894
- He was the new guy to this
gospel group that I was in.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.530
- But she didn't really
give me much attention.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.099
So this is not a love
at first sight situation.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.233
Unfortunately.

27:48.233 --> 27:50.102
After graduating
from U of I,

27:50.102 --> 27:52.104
it just hit me, like,
you need to call this girl

27:52.104 --> 27:54.873
and you need to let her know
that you love her.

27:54.873 --> 27:57.042
- He called me
tipsy.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.979
I'm hearing his cousins
and everybody in the background

28:00.979 --> 28:02.814
like, "Yeah, RAII!
Yeah, go!"

28:02.814 --> 28:04.216
And I'm like,
"Call me tomorrow."

28:04.216 --> 28:06.385
So he did.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.901
He called me the next day
and said the exact same thing.

28:08.901 --> 28:08.921
He called me the next day
and said the exact same thing.

28:08.921 --> 28:09.988
He didn't miss a word.

28:09.988 --> 28:11.823
- So we begin
to date,

28:11.823 --> 28:14.660
and it's been history
ever since.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.361
Okay, baby.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.829
- Since then...
- Mm-hmm.

28:17.829 --> 28:18.864
- we've been
background singing

28:18.864 --> 28:20.566
supporting major artists.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.067
- Mm-hmm.
- All over the world.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.569
- It was an incredible
experience,

28:23.569 --> 28:24.970
but we're ready to share...
- Yes.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.472
- what we've been learning
over the years.

28:27.472 --> 28:28.840
- Yes.
- Everything we've done

28:28.840 --> 28:30.542
has been preparing us
for this moment.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.144
Being here...

28:32.144 --> 28:34.079
- is such
a huge moment.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.647
- It is huge.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.316
We're gonna sing
like we--

28:37.316 --> 28:38.784
- I'm gonna have fun.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.887
- Go get 'em, guys.
Let's go.

28:46.525 --> 28:47.659
- Hi.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.895
Welcome to
"America's Got Talent."

28:49.895 --> 28:51.163
Thank you.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.531
- What are
your guys' names?

28:52.531 --> 28:54.199
- My name is RAII.
- My name is Whitney.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.934
- And we are...
- The Smiths.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.236
- The Smiths.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.370
- We're married.
- The Smiths, we're married.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.738
- Oh, you're married.
Oh, okay.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.306
What are you gonna be doing
for us today?

29:01.306 --> 29:02.641
- We sing together.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.343
- And do you make a living
doing this?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.345
Have you been, like,
doing performances, tours?

29:06.345 --> 29:08.146
Tell me a little bit about that.
- We actually work as

29:08.146 --> 29:08.901
background vocalists for
a lot of major artists now.

29:08.901 --> 29:10.782
background vocalists for
a lot of major artists now.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.851
- Really?
- Alicia Keys is one of 'em.

29:12.851 --> 29:14.086
Chrisette Michele. Estelle.
- Estelle.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.420
- Wow.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.489
- So do you hate the people
you're singing for?

29:17.489 --> 29:18.824
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.

29:18.824 --> 29:21.159
- You never hope
they're gonna fall offstage?

29:21.159 --> 29:22.494
- No.
- Oh, come on.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.862
- Never hate--
I mean, the thing is

29:23.862 --> 29:25.831
they're actually helping us
prepare to do

29:25.831 --> 29:27.165
what we aspire to do.
- Yeah.

29:27.165 --> 29:29.534
- So it's--it's
a great situation for us.

29:29.534 --> 29:32.404
- Okay, well, The Smiths,
good luck. Enjoy yourself.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.440

31:15.841 --> 31:18.877
- Okay, then.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.346
I have to say,

31:21.346 --> 31:24.950
you are both amazing singers,
completely pitch perfect.

31:24.950 --> 31:26.685
You have the great vibe,
the look.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.854
Hands down one of my favorite
singers so far.

31:28.854 --> 31:30.655
- Thank you so much.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.057
- Heidi, what did
you think?

31:32.057 --> 31:34.292
- I loved it. I think you guys
are a fantastic duo.

31:34.292 --> 31:35.660
I love that you're
a married couple

31:35.660 --> 31:36.995
and you're singing together.

31:36.995 --> 31:38.764
And your name is Whitney, right?
- Yeah.

31:38.764 --> 31:38.901
- Whitney,
I love your voice.

31:38.901 --> 31:41.533
- Whitney,
I love your voice.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.801
- Thank you.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.469
- You--Really,
you stand out so much

31:44.469 --> 31:45.937
when you sing, Whitney.
I loved it.

31:45.937 --> 31:47.339
- Thank you.
- Howie.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.641
- I think that this is
a great throwback.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.810
There isn't anybody
like you.

31:51.810 --> 31:53.478
I think there's no question
about your singing

31:53.478 --> 31:55.147
and your style
and everything.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.882
I think you're amazing.

31:56.882 --> 31:57.883
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

31:57.883 --> 31:59.184
- Simon, what did
you think?

31:59.184 --> 32:02.988
- Okay, so you started,
you know, in quite normally.

32:02.988 --> 32:05.223
And I'm thinking, oh, this is
a little bit karaoke.

32:05.223 --> 32:08.260
And then in the middle
you both let rip,

32:08.260 --> 32:08.901
and that's when I thought,
my God,

32:08.901 --> 32:09.661
and that's when I thought,
my God,

32:09.661 --> 32:11.596
you two can
really, really sing.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.331
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

32:13.331 --> 32:15.333
- I really, really
like you two.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.235
- Thank you so much.

32:17.235 --> 32:19.137
- Well, let's vote.

32:19.137 --> 32:20.605
Simon?

32:20.605 --> 32:21.907
- I'm going to say yes.

32:21.907 --> 32:22.941
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.109
- Heidi.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.577
- I'm gonna give you
a definite yes.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.446
- Thank you.
- Howie.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.947
- You just got
your third yes.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.082
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.084
- And you've got your fourth yes
from me!

32:33.084 --> 32:35.153
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

32:35.153 --> 32:36.788
Thank you so much!

32:48.633 --> 32:51.236
- It means so much
to hear

32:51.236 --> 32:52.904
everything we've been
working on

32:52.904 --> 32:54.639
our entire life,

32:54.639 --> 32:56.708
it feels like it's been
leading up to this moment.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.076
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm grateful

32:58.076 --> 32:59.945
that we didn't stop.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.913
- I always find these
people fascinating,

33:01.913 --> 33:03.215
because they're so good.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.816
- But just in
the background.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.084
- How do you get that break?
- Yeah.

33:06.084 --> 33:08.854
- Maybe right now
meeting...

33:08.854 --> 33:08.901
- You never know.

33:08.901 --> 33:09.955
- You never know.

33:09.955 --> 33:11.723
- A celebratory kiss.

33:11.723 --> 33:12.991
Come on, please.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.994
We need to see that.

33:18.029 --> 33:20.098
- I've not done it before.

33:20.098 --> 33:21.933
Oh!

33:21.933 --> 33:23.602
- That was incredible.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.604
- I loved it.

33:25.604 --> 33:29.074
- You are
certifiably nuts.

33:29.074 --> 33:31.209
- You ready?
Come on, Simon! Yeah!

33:31.209 --> 33:34.246
- Don't even ask.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.524
- Oh, my God!

33:54.165 --> 33:55.400
- No!

33:55.400 --> 33:57.102
- I don't like clowns.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.639
- You remind me of clowns,
and clowns scare me.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.173
- Oh.

34:02.173 --> 34:03.875
- There's therapy for that,
Simon.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.677
There's therapy.

34:05.677 --> 34:06.948
- There's a clown
over there.

34:06.948 --> 34:07.479
- There's a clown
over there.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.915
- I'm Mr. Zero,
professional weirdo.

34:09.915 --> 34:12.250
- Professional weirdo?

34:17.856 --> 34:19.424
- I hate clowns.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.526
- What's your name?

34:21.526 --> 34:23.795
- The Jolly Cat.
- The Jolly Cat?

34:23.795 --> 34:25.530
- And I love you.
- What?

34:25.530 --> 34:26.932
- And I love you.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.366
- You love me?

34:28.366 --> 34:29.768
- You're not a jolly cat.
What's your name?

34:29.768 --> 34:31.336
- Vinny from Brooklyn.
Hey, oh.

34:32.537 --> 34:33.538
- Start your act.

34:40.312 --> 34:43.214
- ♪ Waddle like a duck,
waddle like a duck ♪

34:44.849 --> 34:46.785
- ♪ Waddle like a duck, don't
matter, waddle like a duck ♪

34:46.785 --> 34:48.553
- He's just trying
to bring jolly joy.

34:50.055 --> 34:52.958
- My voice
has been hoarse.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.559
I really didn't give you guys
my best,

34:54.559 --> 34:56.294
but I can't prove that.
- Simon,

34:56.294 --> 34:57.329
you're about to face
your fear.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.697
- You scare me.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.999
- And I love you.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.435
- But you said that
you're a cat,

35:03.435 --> 35:06.504
and the song was
about a duck.

35:06.504 --> 35:06.948
- And he's
a little hoarse.

35:06.948 --> 35:08.907
- And he's
a little hoarse.

35:08.907 --> 35:09.941
- Yeah, yeah.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.210
- It's four nos.
Thank you.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.281
- Simon Cowell, I don't think
he likes clowns.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.415
You think
he likes clowns?

35:17.415 --> 35:20.285
- I don't know.
I never helped him.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.187
- You know I am.

35:25.357 --> 35:28.226
- That's a breakthrough.

35:28.226 --> 35:29.227
- Yeah, I hate them.

35:29.227 --> 35:31.463
- He is.

35:42.207 --> 35:43.575
- Whoa.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.885
- Simon has a really strong
opinion on this act.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.387
- Very good then.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.422
- I don't want to see it again.
I'm gonna say no.

35:57.422 --> 36:01.192
A clown in a box is just about
as bad as it can get for me.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.035
- Are you ready?

36:10.035 --> 36:13.204
- Yeah, what up,?

36:13.204 --> 36:15.507
Get it, get it, get it!

36:15.507 --> 36:17.108
Whoo!

36:17.108 --> 36:19.744
Ooh, aah! Yeah!

36:19.744 --> 36:20.845
- Don't look, don't look,
don't look.

36:20.845 --> 36:21.980
- What up?

36:21.980 --> 36:22.981
- Hello.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.649
- Whoo!

36:24.649 --> 36:26.151
- Whoa.
- Hello.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.552
- How's it going, guys?

36:27.552 --> 36:29.054
- How you doing?
- Doing good. How you doing?

36:29.054 --> 36:30.422
- Good.
What's your name?

36:30.422 --> 36:31.923
- I'm Richie the Barber.

36:31.923 --> 36:33.258
- Oh, God.

36:33.258 --> 36:34.759
- You know, I just got to say
right off the bat,

36:34.759 --> 36:36.227
there's a man
sitting there who has--

36:36.227 --> 36:36.948
- Simon, I love you.

36:36.948 --> 36:37.362
- Simon, I love you.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.530
- Well, wait.
- Oh.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.565
- I don't think
it's gonna be reciprocal

36:40.565 --> 36:42.400
because he has
a fear of clowns.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.736
- But I'm blue, though.

36:44.736 --> 36:47.072
- Is it better when
clowns are blue?

36:47.072 --> 36:48.173
- I don't know.

36:48.173 --> 36:50.308
- So how long have you
been a clown?

36:50.308 --> 36:52.410
- I've been a clown
about three years, tattooed.

36:52.410 --> 36:53.645
- That's not makeup?

36:53.645 --> 36:54.646
- Your whole face
is tattooed?

36:54.646 --> 36:55.747
- Yeah.
- That's not makeup?

36:55.747 --> 36:57.348
- It's not coming off.
- No.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.319
- Your face is tattooed...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:01.319 --> 37:02.787
- into a clown?
- Yeah.

37:02.787 --> 37:04.189
You know, the--yeah.
- Let me ask you.

37:04.189 --> 37:05.890
When did you start deciding
to become a clown?

37:05.890 --> 37:06.948
- When I was
ten years old,

37:06.948 --> 37:07.358
- When I was
ten years old,

37:07.358 --> 37:09.027
my grandfather took me
to the circus

37:09.027 --> 37:10.628
and I saw a clown,
and he turned around.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.931
He was all,
"Shh, don't be scared.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.599
You want to learn how
to juggle?"

37:14.599 --> 37:16.901
So then he pulls out
all these scarves,

37:16.901 --> 37:18.269
and then he makes them
float in the air.

37:18.269 --> 37:21.539
And he told me,
"Anytime you're sad, juggle.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.108
Anytime you're happy,
juggle."

37:23.108 --> 37:24.309
He inspired me so much.

37:24.309 --> 37:27.345
I went home
and I got in my mom's makeup

37:27.345 --> 37:29.581
and I started painting my face,
and my mom was like,

37:29.581 --> 37:31.349
"What are you doing?
Don't paint your face."

37:31.349 --> 37:33.785
I'm like, "I want to be a clown.
I want to be a clown forever."

- So why have you entered

42:21.105 --> 42:23.674
- Because we built
our own act.

42:23.674 --> 42:24.976
- Yeah.

42:24.976 --> 42:27.245
- And we want to show

42:27.245 --> 42:29.547
and "America's Got Talent"
is the best place to do it.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.121
- Okay.

42:30.121 --> 42:31.749
- Okay.

42:31.749 --> 42:34.285
I don't know what that is,
but is this dangerous?

42:34.285 --> 42:35.653

very dangerous.

42:35.653 --> 42:36.788

- Is it?

42:36.788 --> 42:39.590

she's been hurt before.

42:39.590 --> 42:40.825
- Wow.

42:40.825 --> 42:42.493
- And it's a big step for her...
- Oh, wow.

42:42.493 --> 42:44.796
- to do it again.

42:48.132 --> 42:49.834
- Four years
and a half ago,

42:49.834 --> 42:52.036
I was working with
another partner

42:52.036 --> 42:54.472
and had a big fall.

42:54.472 --> 42:57.308
I break my spine.

42:57.308 --> 43:00.121
And I was worried about
if I would be able

43:00.121 --> 43:00.378
And I was worried about
if I would be able

43:00.378 --> 43:02.246
to perform again.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.282
Am I gonna be able
to walk again?

43:04.282 --> 43:07.351
That was very scary
for me

43:07.351 --> 43:10.188
and recovery was
really difficult.

43:10.188 --> 43:13.124
But a not long time after,
I met Andre.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.293
- The first time
I saw Annie,

43:15.293 --> 43:17.395
like I was
so impressed

43:17.395 --> 43:20.898
about her spirit
and how she's really pretty

43:20.898 --> 43:22.733
and special.

43:22.733 --> 43:25.603
- I knew that he was
the man for me.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.538
And I think he knew,
too,

43:27.538 --> 43:30.121
that we were made--
meant to be together.

43:30.121 --> 43:31.609
that we were made--
meant to be together.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.846
We decided that we want to
perform as a duo.

43:34.846 --> 43:37.381
But when I got
back up there,

43:37.381 --> 43:40.218
I was really scared.

43:42.587 --> 43:45.223
He looked me in the eyes
and he went,

43:45.223 --> 43:46.624
"I'm there to
catch you."

43:46.624 --> 43:50.661
And then it's,
oh, yes, finally.

43:50.661 --> 43:54.665
I can do this again.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.103
- So even though
you hurt yourself

43:59.103 --> 44:00.121
really, really, really badly,
you want to do it again.

44:00.121 --> 44:01.205
really, really, really badly,
you want to do it again.

44:01.205 --> 44:02.240
- Yes.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.342
This is where I belong,
I think.

44:04.342 --> 44:05.776
I love to be in the air, so...
- In the air?

44:05.776 --> 44:06.777
- Yes.

44:06.777 --> 44:07.845
- Good luck.

44:07.845 --> 44:09.347
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.299
- Aw.

44:50.021 --> 44:51.022
- Whoa!

44:51.022 --> 44:52.523
- Wow.

45:01.566 --> 45:02.800
Whoa.

45:19.784 --> 45:20.885
- Wow!

45:28.559 --> 45:29.894
- Oh, my God.

45:47.445 --> 45:50.314
- Wow.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.230
- Whoa!

46:14.071 --> 46:16.140
I love that.

46:29.253 --> 46:30.121
- Mel.

46:30.121 --> 46:30.454

46:30.454 --> 46:33.624
- Well, that was
pretty incredible.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.060
Absolutely incredible.

46:36.060 --> 46:38.296
What you were doing was
so dangerous,

46:38.296 --> 46:40.131
and I could see you
really focusing.

46:40.131 --> 46:43.034
When you do that thing, does
your tummy, like, roll over,

46:43.034 --> 46:44.302
like, you know,
when you feel a bit sick?

46:44.302 --> 46:45.670
'Cause I get that
on an airplane.

46:45.670 --> 46:48.673
When we go over a little bump,
my stomach goes, blurb.

46:48.673 --> 46:51.375
- Actually, I don't have time
to think about this.

46:51.375 --> 46:53.444
- Yeah, Mel, I think when
she's kind of like in midair,

46:53.444 --> 46:55.046
she's not really thinking
about her stomach.

46:56.881 --> 46:58.549
- Well, it was stunning,
absolutely stunning.

outstanding.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.643
I mean,

this amazing relationship,

So what you're gonna do, 'cause
I think I've seen something.

51:53.711 --> 51:54.812
Is this dangerous?

51:54.812 --> 51:56.547
- This is
extremely dangerous.

51:56.547 --> 51:57.982
- Oh.
- Right.

52:02.019 --> 52:04.054
- I first started
swallowing swords

52:04.054 --> 52:05.990
in 1997.

52:05.990 --> 52:07.391
Practiced for four years,

52:07.391 --> 52:10.294
a total of about
13, 000 unsuccessful attempts

52:10.294 --> 52:13.163
before I got my first sword
down my throat in 2001.

52:14.832 --> 52:15.990
When I swallow a sword,
I have to repress

52:15.990 --> 52:16.800
When I swallow a sword,
I have to repress

52:16.800 --> 52:18.636
the gag reflex
in the back of my throat,

52:18.636 --> 52:21.105
navigate a 90-degree turn
down the epiglottis,

52:21.105 --> 52:24.041
flip open
the epiglottis,

52:24.041 --> 52:27.344
slide the blade down into my
chest cavity between the lungs,

52:27.344 --> 52:29.013
and there it actually
runs into my heart,

52:29.013 --> 52:31.181
and I actually have to
nudge my heart to the left.

52:31.181 --> 52:32.983
I've been injured
several times.

52:32.983 --> 52:36.487
My worst injuries were in 2005
when I punctured my stomach

52:36.487 --> 52:38.188
while swallowing
five swords at once.

52:38.188 --> 52:40.024
In 2010, I punctured
my esophagus

52:40.024 --> 52:41.358
while swallowing
two swords.

52:41.358 --> 52:44.862
And last year I was trying
to do 29 swords at once

52:44.862 --> 52:45.990
and kind of screwed up
my throat for a few weeks.

52:45.990 --> 52:46.897
and kind of screwed up
my throat for a few weeks.

52:46.897 --> 52:48.198
So it was kind of tough.
- Okay. Yeah.

52:53.137 --> 52:54.972
- What I'm going to attempt
tonight,

52:54.972 --> 52:56.674
I've never done it
before.

52:56.674 --> 52:59.109
So this is
really dangerous stuff here.

52:59.109 --> 53:01.879
What I'm going to
attempt to do tonight

53:01.879 --> 53:04.815
is going to be
so much bigger

53:04.815 --> 53:06.684
than anything
I've ever done before.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.686
- Bigger meaning
more dangerous?

53:08.686 --> 53:10.587
- Bigger meaning
more dangerous.

53:10.587 --> 53:11.955
- Are you sure
about this?

53:11.955 --> 53:13.590
- I'm pretty sure.

53:13.590 --> 53:15.893
Now, I've not done it
before,

53:15.893 --> 53:15.990
so I'm not sure
if it's gonna work.

53:15.990 --> 53:17.061
so I'm not sure
if it's gonna work.

53:17.061 --> 53:18.195
- What?

53:18.195 --> 53:21.765
- Simon, this is my purpose,
my calling.

53:21.765 --> 53:23.500
This is my proof
that it--

53:23.500 --> 53:25.602
the impossible is
not impossible.

53:27.004 --> 53:29.106
- All right, Dan,
well, we're rooting for you.

53:29.106 --> 53:30.574
Good luck.
- Thank you.

53:30.574 --> 53:32.676
- I'm scared.

53:32.676 --> 53:34.411
He's never
done this before.

53:36.447 --> 53:38.582
- Don't try this at home.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.720
- Oh, God.

53:51.095 --> 53:54.164
- Oh!

53:56.333 --> 53:58.335
- Oh, yeah!

54:03.974 --> 54:05.342
That's just
the beginning.

54:05.342 --> 54:09.146
Oh, no.

54:09.146 --> 54:11.915
What I have here is
a car axle,

54:11.915 --> 54:14.518
1929 car axle.

54:14.518 --> 54:15.990
This weighs about
eight pounds.

54:15.990 --> 54:16.120
This weighs about
eight pounds.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.654
I've got to make sure
it doesn't go through me

54:17.654 --> 54:18.689
when I let go of it.

54:18.689 --> 54:19.957
This thing is
very, very heavy.

54:19.957 --> 54:21.558
Ladies and gentlemen,
the car axle.

54:36.807 --> 54:38.208
Oh, yeah!

54:39.243 --> 54:40.944
- He just swallowed
a car axle.

54:40.944 --> 54:42.846
- Here's where we take it
to another level.

54:42.846 --> 54:45.716
That is only part
of a car.

54:45.716 --> 54:45.990
We're gonna do something
better than that.

54:45.990 --> 54:47.417
We're gonna do something
better than that.

54:47.417 --> 54:50.687
How about we do
an entire car?

54:50.687 --> 54:53.223
Where's Nick? Nick,
I'm gonna need you out here.

54:53.223 --> 54:56.260
Nick, come here.

54:56.260 --> 54:57.327
- What?

54:57.327 --> 54:58.829
- We don't have
an entire car.

55:08.906 --> 55:10.440
- What I have here is
about a 20-inch sword

55:10.440 --> 55:12.476
with a little
metal plate on this.

55:12.476 --> 55:13.544
- Uh-huh.

55:13.544 --> 55:14.611
- Nick would you
take a look at that?

55:14.611 --> 55:16.280
Make sure it is
a real sword.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.681
- It's definitely
a real sword.

55:17.681 --> 55:19.583
- Yeah, and now I've got
your fingerprints on it

55:19.583 --> 55:21.318
in case anything goes wrong.
- Great.

55:21.318 --> 55:25.122
- So what we're gonna do is
they're gonna pull out this car,

55:25.122 --> 55:27.558
and we are going to
attach that car,

55:27.558 --> 55:30.360
straps, to this sword

55:30.360 --> 55:33.897
and I'm going to attempt
to pull that car

55:33.897 --> 55:35.599
all the way across
the stage,

55:35.599 --> 55:36.036
no hands, using just
my stomach and my mouth.

55:36.036 --> 55:38.569
no hands, using just
my stomach and my mouth.

55:40.037 --> 55:41.572
You can clamp that
on there.

55:41.572 --> 55:43.173
- So what am I
gonna do?

55:43.173 --> 55:45.342
- I need you to get in the car
and steer the car,

55:45.342 --> 55:48.745
and don't hit the brake until
we get close to the edge.

55:48.745 --> 55:51.381
- Okay.

56:20.644 --> 56:23.614
- Oh!

56:25.148 --> 56:26.950
- Oh!

56:29.953 --> 56:32.122
- Yeah!

56:38.862 --> 56:40.797
- We did it.

56:40.797 --> 56:42.866
- You're a crazy person.

56:44.534 --> 56:46.103
- We did it, man.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.337
- We did.

56:47.337 --> 56:49.039
- Thank you.

56:49.039 --> 56:50.841
- Crazy person.

56:50.841 --> 56:52.809
- Oh, my gosh.

56:52.809 --> 56:54.278
- Mel.

56:54.278 --> 56:56.146
- I don't know why
you would want to do this,

56:56.146 --> 56:58.148
but I couldn't
stop looking.

56:58.148 --> 56:59.216
Does it hurt?

56:59.216 --> 57:01.018
- It does
a little bit.

57:01.018 --> 57:02.619
Don't try this
at home.

57:02.619 --> 57:03.787
- No chance of that.

57:06.223 --> 57:07.591
Howie, what did
you think?

57:07.591 --> 57:10.560
- You know, on this show,
we've seen strength acts

57:10.560 --> 57:12.829
and we've seen
sword swallowers.

57:12.829 --> 57:15.365
The thought that
those two things could blend

57:15.365 --> 57:16.934
is unbelievable.

57:16.934 --> 57:19.069
- Thank you.

57:19.069 --> 57:21.305
- I have to say, you know,
some of the acts that

57:21.305 --> 57:23.807
come onto the stage
where I kind of cannot look

57:23.807 --> 57:26.376
because I'm so scared, I have
to, like, peek all the time.

57:26.376 --> 57:28.245
But it was
pretty impressive.

57:28.245 --> 57:31.949
- Dan, you are
certifiably nuts.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.083
- Thank you.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.385
- But I think what you did
was incredible.

57:35.385 --> 57:36.036
- Thank you.

57:36.036 --> 57:36.553
- Thank you.

57:36.553 --> 57:38.021
- Okay,
we're gonna vote.

57:38.021 --> 57:40.123
Let's start with
Howie.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.458
- Yes!

57:42.826 --> 57:43.894
- Mel.

57:43.894 --> 57:45.762
- Yeah, I'm gonna
have to say yes.

57:45.762 --> 57:47.531
- Thank you.

57:47.531 --> 57:48.598
- Heidi?

57:48.598 --> 57:49.933
- I'm gonna give you
a yes.

57:49.933 --> 57:51.902
- Thank you.

57:51.902 --> 57:54.972
- Dan Meyer,
I am very happy to tell you

57:54.972 --> 57:57.240
you have four yeses. You're
through to the next round.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.976
- Yes!

57:58.976 --> 58:00.644
Yeah! Thank you.

58:01.878 --> 58:03.847
That's why I do it.
Thank you very much.

58:03.847 --> 58:04.948
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

58:04.948 --> 58:06.036
- Well done, Dan.

58:06.036 --> 58:06.383
- Well done, Dan.

58:11.154 --> 58:12.556
- Well...
- We did it, man.

58:12.556 --> 58:13.590
- We did it.

58:13.590 --> 58:15.359
- Whoo! Wow.

58:15.359 --> 58:16.426
- Are you all right?

58:16.426 --> 58:18.228
- I am. I'm shaking,
but I'm good.

58:18.228 --> 58:19.629
- You pulled a car
across the stage

58:19.629 --> 58:21.164
with a sword
inside you, man.

58:21.164 --> 58:22.599
- Thank you for not
pushing the brakes,

58:22.599 --> 58:23.600
or I would have had
an abrupt stop.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.568
- Yeah, well, ugh!

58:24.568 --> 58:25.569
- Whoo!

58:25.569 --> 58:27.137
- We're on
a roll now, guys.

58:27.137 --> 58:29.339
It's like a treadmill,
you can't get off.

58:29.339 --> 58:31.441
- I like it when
it's like this.

58:32.642 --> 58:34.745
- Oh, my God,

58:34.745 --> 58:36.036

58:43.353 --> 58:46.123
I've liked him ever since
I started watching "AGT."

58:46.123 --> 58:49.359
- Do they have any Bactine
or something?

58:49.359 --> 58:50.961
I cut--

58:50.961 --> 58:52.829
- Howie's cut himself.
It's quite serious.

58:52.829 --> 58:56.500
- I should know,
do not handle a chisel.

58:56.500 --> 58:57.768
- Do you want to tell me
what you were doing?

58:57.768 --> 58:59.703

I'm sort of like
a normal ninth grader,

1:02:40.624 --> 1:02:43.059
you go to school,
you do your homework,

1:02:43.059 --> 1:02:46.696
but instead of playing with
your friends afterwards,

1:02:46.696 --> 1:02:49.232
I'll be practicing
my act.

1:02:49.232 --> 1:02:52.302

- And I own

1:02:59.009 --> 1:03:01.378
He helps me make
these different props.

1:03:01.378 --> 1:03:05.081

anything that doesn't work.

- This routine I've only been
practicing for a week.

1:03:09.986 --> 1:03:11.688
I kind of feel nervous.

1:03:11.688 --> 1:03:14.157
There's so many people
in the audience

1:03:14.157 --> 1:03:17.927
and four judges who look at
every little detail.

1:03:19.062 --> 1:03:20.730
- Okay, Sophie, this is it.
Good luck!

1:03:20.730 --> 1:03:22.198

1:03:33.443 --> 1:03:34.844

- What's your name,
and how old are you?

1:03:36.379 --> 1:03:38.815
- My name's Sophie Dawcy,
and I'm 14 years old.

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:40.483
- You're 14 years old,
so you're still in school.

1:03:40.483 --> 1:03:41.885
- Yeah.

1:03:41.885 --> 1:03:44.321
- What is it you're gonna be
doing for us today?

1:03:44.321 --> 1:03:46.289
- I'll be doing hand balance
and contortion.

1:03:47.390 --> 1:03:48.958
- Wow.

1:03:48.958 --> 1:03:50.727
And when did you discover
you wanted to do it

1:03:50.727 --> 1:03:52.595
or could even do it?

1:03:52.595 --> 1:03:53.073
- I found this out by watching
a video of contortion

1:03:53.073 --> 1:03:55.298
- I found this out by watching
a video of contortion

1:03:55.298 --> 1:03:57.767
and I was like, "Oh, my gosh,
I really want to try this."

1:03:57.767 --> 1:04:00.170
And after I tried it,
I just fell in love with it.

1:04:00.170 --> 1:04:01.571
- Oh, wow.

1:04:01.571 --> 1:04:03.440
And is your family
supportive?

1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:05.475
- My parents are
very supportive.

1:04:05.475 --> 1:04:08.244
In fact, my dad made me
these canes,

1:04:08.244 --> 1:04:10.513
and that thing that's
holding the apple

1:04:10.513 --> 1:04:12.515
is a toilet paper holder.

- Well, my back's
always been flexible.

1:07:31.814 --> 1:07:33.583
Like, when I was really little
I'd run around the house

1:07:33.583 --> 1:07:35.418

it is amazing.

1:14:41.911 --> 1:14:45.715
Five guys on the stage

1:15:00.129 --> 1:15:01.263

1:15:01.263 --> 1:15:03.332
- I was just kind of
a bit gobsmacked,

1:15:03.332 --> 1:15:05.901
'cause I didn't know where to
look or who to look at.

1:15:05.901 --> 1:15:08.838
But you're one of those acts
that I would literally

1:15:08.838 --> 1:15:12.108
want to see again and again

1:15:12.108 --> 1:15:13.909

1:15:22.485 --> 1:15:25.921
I was imagining
in my head

1:15:25.921 --> 1:15:27.423
when I go home tonight

1:15:27.423 --> 1:15:30.126
and my girlfriend says, "What
was your day like at work?"

1:15:31.727 --> 1:15:34.230
And I'm trying to explain
the whole day,

1:15:34.230 --> 1:15:36.298
which is gonna be
difficult,

1:15:36.298 --> 1:15:38.667
but that's what I love
about this show.

- I'm 28.

1:17:31.780 --> 1:17:33.682
- So what's the dream?
Why "America's Got Talent"?

1:17:33.682 --> 1:17:34.717
- I want to be a singer.

1:17:34.717 --> 1:17:36.018
- Great.

1:17:36.018 --> 1:17:37.486
- And who are
you here with?

1:17:37.486 --> 1:17:38.821
- My mom's up there.
Hi, Mom!

1:17:40.856 --> 1:17:42.024
- Aw.
- Aw.

1:17:42.024 --> 1:17:43.826
- My mom being here is
everything to me.

1:17:43.826 --> 1:17:45.961
I had a lot of hard times
when I was a kid,

1:17:45.961 --> 1:17:49.071
and she's been
a huge supporter for me

1:17:49.071 --> 1:17:49.365
and she's been
a huge supporter for me

1:17:49.365 --> 1:17:50.799
- Oh, wow.

1:17:53.335 --> 1:17:55.070
- My mom has always been
my rock,

1:17:55.070 --> 1:17:57.907
and she's always been
my biggest fan.

1:17:57.907 --> 1:17:59.675
I've been singing
my whole life.

1:17:59.675 --> 1:18:02.244
And she knew how important
it was to me,

1:18:02.244 --> 1:18:04.013
and she encouraged that.

1:18:04.013 --> 1:18:05.648
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

1:18:05.648 --> 1:18:07.583
- I'm proud of how hard
you've worked.

1:18:07.583 --> 1:18:10.085
I'm proud of the
single-mindedness

1:18:10.085 --> 1:18:12.488
you've had
all your life.

1:18:12.488 --> 1:18:15.324
- In school, I was bullied
for being overweight.

1:18:15.324 --> 1:18:16.892
I was bullied
for being gay.

1:18:16.892 --> 1:18:19.071
I was bullied for, you know,
wanting to be a singer.

1:18:19.071 --> 1:18:20.196
I was bullied for, you know,
wanting to be a singer.

1:18:20.196 --> 1:18:23.232
I just begged her to let me
live with my aunt and uncle

1:18:23.232 --> 1:18:25.834
in Oregon to have
a fresh start,

1:18:25.834 --> 1:18:29.004
and she let me go.

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:32.441
I know that
that was harder for her

1:18:32.441 --> 1:18:35.911
than it was for me to...

1:18:35.911 --> 1:18:37.179
to do that for me.

1:18:37.179 --> 1:18:39.048
It was a gift that
she gave me,

1:18:39.048 --> 1:18:40.716
and I still, to this day,

1:18:40.716 --> 1:18:44.119
appreciate that so much.

1:18:44.119 --> 1:18:47.756
I've been struggling just
trying to make this happen.

1:18:47.756 --> 1:18:49.071
Right now, I'm driving for
a car service.

1:18:49.071 --> 1:18:50.593
Right now, I'm driving for
a car service.

1:18:50.593 --> 1:18:52.361
It's paying my bills,

1:18:52.361 --> 1:18:55.531
but this is my chance to share
with the world what I do,

1:18:55.531 --> 1:18:59.168
and I hope that this is
my moment to say thank you

1:18:59.168 --> 1:19:02.204
to my mom,
and I love you so much.

1:19:05.975 --> 1:19:08.577
- Well, Brian, good luck
and enjoy yourself.

1:19:08.577 --> 1:19:09.945

you found everybody

1:22:40.556 --> 1:22:43.992

1:22:43.992 --> 1:22:45.327
- Thank you.
- And I'll tell you what,

1:22:45.327 --> 1:22:47.596
if I wasn't married
and you were straight,

1:22:47.596 --> 1:22:49.071
we would be in love.

1:22:49.071 --> 1:22:49.331
we would be in love.

mood. Don't ruin it.

1:22:51.467 --> 1:22:53.635

1:22:53.635 --> 1:22:54.703
Heidi.

1:22:54.703 --> 1:22:56.104
- Well, I just love

1:22:56.104 --> 1:22:59.041
that you just showed all those
people who bullied you.

1:22:59.041 --> 1:23:00.442
Good for you.

1:23:00.442 --> 1:23:02.110
- Thank you.

1:23:02.110 --> 1:23:04.279

and I felt that.

1:23:04.279 --> 1:23:05.514
- Thank you.

1:23:05.514 --> 1:23:07.149
- Simon.

1:23:07.149 --> 1:23:09.985
- I'm guessing that's probably
one of the biggest performances

1:23:09.985 --> 1:23:11.086
you've ever given,
isn't it?

1:23:11.086 --> 1:23:12.721
- The biggest.

1:23:12.721 --> 1:23:15.123
- Yeah.
Every ounce of you came out.

1:23:15.123 --> 1:23:17.493
And the truth is,

1:23:17.493 --> 1:23:19.071
you are
a fantastic singer.

1:23:19.071 --> 1:23:19.595
you are
a fantastic singer.

1:23:22.431 --> 1:23:25.267
This is why
these shows exist,

1:23:25.267 --> 1:23:27.536
is to give people like you
with huge talent
