20:05.875 --> 20:07.437
SO, THANKS.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.981
SAM, WE HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

20:11.981 --> 20:17.917
YOU ARE GONNA LOVE US.
LOVE. US.
[LAUGHS]

20:18.648 --> 20:20.520
SAM, YOU ARE
ABOUT TO SEE

20:20.520 --> 20:23.993
THAT WHEN DEMONS
SET THEIR MINDS
ON SOMETHING,

20:23.993 --> 20:26.926
THEY GET
THE JOB DONE.

20:27.497 --> 20:29.999
[CLAPS] BEHOLD--
OUR GIFT TO YOU!

20:29.999 --> 20:33.433
WE'VE PREPARED
A HUMAN SACRIFICE!

Tony: ALL FOR YOU,
SAM.

20:34.804 --> 20:37.006
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HOW IS THIS FOR ME?

20:37.006 --> 20:40.710
WELL, THIS GETS YOU
OUT OF YOUR CONTRACT
WITH THE DEVIL.

20:40.710 --> 20:41.341
HOW?

20:44.574 --> 20:46.276
HE KNOWS HOW
TO WORK THE SYSTEM.

20:46.276 --> 20:50.420
WHAT YOU DO IS
FILL OUT THE STANDARD
357J TRANSFER WAIVER,

20:50.420 --> 20:52.922
BUT ATTACH
THE INTANGIBLE
PROPERTIES RIDER.

20:52.922 --> 20:54.924
IT'S IRREGULAR,
BUT PERMISSIBLE.

20:54.924 --> 20:58.988
THIS GUY'S SOUL TAKES
YOUR PLACE IN HELL
AND IT'S IRON CLAD.

20:58.988 --> 21:00.930
THE DEVIL
CAN'T REVERSE IT.

21:00.930 --> 21:05.695
HERE, JUST JAM THIS
THROUGH HIS HEART...EASY AS PIE.

21:05.995 --> 21:07.637
GUYS, NO.

21:07.637 --> 21:09.539
I'M NOT SENDING
AN INNOCENT PERSON

21:09.539 --> 21:10.440
TO HELL IN MY PLACE.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.741
SAM, HE'S HARDLY
INNOCENT.

21:11.741 --> 21:12.442
HE'S A DRUG DEALER.

21:12.442 --> 21:14.874
HE TRIED TO SELL ME
WEED IN THE PARK.

21:14.874 --> 21:15.875
IT'S A GATEWAY DRUG.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.578
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU GUYS?

21:18.578 --> 21:21.010
SACRIFICING A PERSON
IS EVIL!

21:25.415 --> 21:26.316
HE'S RIGHT.

21:26.316 --> 21:27.587
ALL THIS TIME
WE'VE BEEN TRYING

21:27.587 --> 21:28.658
TO COMBAT
OUR DEMON NATURES,

21:28.658 --> 21:30.620
AND THEN WE GO AND DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.862
WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF OURSELVES, YOU GUYS.

21:32.862 --> 21:35.465
COME ON.
WE SHOULD RETURN
THIS GUY TO THE PARK.

21:35.465 --> 21:37.767
UPSY-DAISY.
COME ON, BUDDY.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.934

Randy: [SIGHS] WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S IT FOR THIS WEEK.

21:48.738 --> 21:51.481
HEY, THANKS TO STEWART
FOR SECURING THIS THEATER SPACE.

21:51.481 --> 21:55.815
DON'T MISS HIS TURN AS PUCK,
BECAUSE HE IS FABULOUS.
Tony: WAIT!

21:56.346 --> 21:58.317
WE SHOULDN'T FEEL ASHAMED.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.551
WE WERE NOT BUILT
TO BE PACIFISTS!

22:01.551 --> 22:03.593
WE ARE DEMONS!

22:03.593 --> 22:06.596
WE NEED TO PLAY
TO OUR STRENGTHS.

22:06.596 --> 22:07.697
WE'RE DEMONS!

22:07.697 --> 22:09.899
WE DON'T NEED TO KILL
THE DEVIL WITH KINDNESS.

22:09.899 --> 22:13.002
WE NEED TO KILL HIM.
PERIOD!

22:13.002 --> 22:15.635
HE'S RIGHT!
All: YEAH!

22:17.066 --> 22:20.670
NOW, NOW, WE HAVE
THE TOOL WE NEED

22:20.670 --> 22:22.011
TO DESTROY HIM NOW!

22:22.011 --> 22:24.974
SAM IS
THE DEVIL'S FRIEND!

22:24.974 --> 22:28.047
UH, TO BE CLEAR,
I'M NOT FRIENDS WITH HIM.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.019
HE'S JUST KINDA CLINGY.

22:30.019 --> 22:32.351
THEN MAKE HIM
YOUR FRIEND.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.685
USE HIS WEAKNESS
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

22:35.685 --> 22:35.955
HOW?

22:35.955 --> 22:37.787
WE NEED YOU
TO SUMMON THE DEVIL.

22:37.787 --> 22:40.890
GET HIS CELL NUMBER.
WE CAN USE THAT
TO BRING HIM HERE.

22:40.890 --> 22:43.563
GET THAT NUMBER
AND WE'LL HANDLE THE REST.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.965
All: YEAH.

SUMMON THE DEVIL,

22:50.500 --> 22:53.002
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
GONNA BE ABLE TO HURT HIM?

23:31.541 --> 23:33.883
EVERYTHING IS SO CLEAR.
I KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG

23:33.883 --> 23:35.014
WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP
THE WHOLE TIME.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.015
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?
MM-HMM.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.417
YOU THINK THAT
YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME!

I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.

23:45.555 --> 23:46.195
ON SOME SMALL LEVEL,
I KNEW IT.

23:46.195 --> 23:49.158
THE WHOLE TIME
WE WERE GOING OUT,
YOU LOOKED DOWN ON ME.

23:49.158 --> 23:52.031
YOU KNOW WHY?
YOU DATE DOWN!

23:52.031 --> 23:53.863
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN?

23:53.863 --> 23:55.134
WHERE ARE YOU
GETTING THIS?

GO ON A DATE WITH HIM?

24:02.441 --> 24:04.213
I WORK 80-HOUR WEEKS.
SO WHAT?

24:04.213 --> 24:05.975
I DON'T DATE
WHERE I WORK.

ONLY HATE.

40:33.001 --> 40:34.563
OH, HO HO, YES.
I'M SO TERRIFIED

40:34.563 --> 40:36.004
BY PEOPLE WHO ARE
SUPER FRIENDLY.

40:36.004 --> 40:38.166
OH, COME ON, YOU
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE
TO ALL THE TROUBLE

40:38.166 --> 40:39.107
IF YOU
WEREN'T AFRAID.

40:39.107 --> 40:40.569
WHAT THEY WERE PLANNING
WAS GONNA WORK.

40:40.569 --> 40:42.511
WELL, THAT'S
AN ADORABLE THEORY

40:42.511 --> 40:44.042
BUT COMPLETELY WRONG.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.475
LOVE, GENEROSITY,
DECENCY.

40:46.475 --> 40:48.046
IT WEAKENS YOU.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.948
IF EVERYBODY
IN THE WORLD WERE GOOD,

40:49.948 --> 40:51.850
YOU'D HAVE
NO ONE TO TEMPT.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.522
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
EXIST!

40:53.522 --> 40:54.152
IT WOULD DESTROY YOU!

40:54.152 --> 40:58.687
WELL, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF THAT EVER HAPPENING?

40:58.687 --> 41:00.929
HUH? HA HA!

41:02.991 --> 41:05.233
BY THE WAY...

41:05.894 --> 41:08.967
I'M CHANGING
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.778
[GROWLING]
