WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:06.605
(country music playing
over car radio)

00:12.178 --> 00:14.213
(phone rings)

00:18.251 --> 00:23.355
Remind me again how I drew
the short straw on pick-up duty.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.190
Man:
You lost fair and square.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.259
Okay, fine-- you two enjoy
your beauty sleep.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.762
Connie may not need it,
but you sure as hell do.

00:29.764 --> 00:30.763
(both laughing)

00:30.765 --> 00:31.764
They're running late?

00:31.766 --> 00:33.132
You need some company out there?

00:33.134 --> 00:34.266
Nah, nah, it's all good.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.735
I don't know, 20 minutes ago.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.104
(girls laughing)
so, they should be...

00:39.106 --> 00:40.739
Oh, here they are now.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.108
Oh, what do you know--
it's your dad.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.543
On the phone
with your dad, I bet.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.378
Hm, it's so sweet
how they hover.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.147
So weird how they
stalk, you mean.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.215
(laughs) totally.
(van engine revving)

00:51.151 --> 00:52.317
(tires screech)

00:52.319 --> 00:54.186
Get in the van!

00:54.188 --> 00:56.121
Oh, no!
Kidnapper: Now!

00:56.123 --> 00:59.091
Hey, what are
you doing?!

00:59.093 --> 01:00.159
Get away from me!

01:00.161 --> 01:01.293
Get the hell off!

01:01.295 --> 01:02.194
(grunts)

01:02.196 --> 01:04.229
Girl (screams):
Stop it!

01:04.231 --> 01:06.165
Help!
I said get
in the van!

01:06.167 --> 01:07.800
Girl:
...Go for help!

01:07.802 --> 01:10.202
(grunts)
(screams)

01:10.204 --> 01:13.338
Get back here!
Girl: No!

01:14.407 --> 01:16.508
Stop it, stop it!
Get in the van!

01:16.510 --> 01:19.244
Get in there.
(girl screaming)

01:19.246 --> 01:20.813
Come on, let's go!

01:20.815 --> 01:23.348
Drive! Go!

01:23.350 --> 01:25.417
Girl:
Help, help me!

01:25.419 --> 01:27.152
Please, they have rosie...

01:27.154 --> 01:29.254
Dad!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.490
No! Daddy!

01:31.492 --> 01:32.791
No!

01:32.793 --> 01:34.593
Somebody help us!

01:34.595 --> 01:37.629
(siren blares in distance)
no, daddy, please, no.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.299
No, please,
don't leave me.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.834
(ziva humming happily)

02:19.506 --> 02:21.206
Whatever this is,
it better be good.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.876
I was having the best dream...

02:23.878 --> 02:26.879
Brigitte bardot
and raquel welch.

02:26.881 --> 02:29.181
Why do bad guys always
get up so early?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.516
Pre-dawn calls
are often reserved

02:30.518 --> 02:32.351
For very bad guys,
I'm afraid.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.652
Afraid and yet...

02:33.654 --> 02:36.155
(suppressing a yawn):
So chipper.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.356
I was already awake, tony.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.359
A very good friend
called from israel.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.594
He had forgotten
the time difference.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.229
"he" as in...

02:44.231 --> 02:45.831
"he" as in "male,"
tony, yes,

02:45.833 --> 02:47.900
I do have male
friends, you know?
No, you don't.

02:47.902 --> 02:50.369
Even guys who say
they want to be your friends

02:50.371 --> 02:55.240
Billy crystal, meg ryan--
<i>when harry met sally.</i>

02:55.242 --> 02:56.875
Genius.

02:56.877 --> 03:00.512
Neither up this street
nor down this road.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.447
You seem awfully excited.

03:02.449 --> 03:03.782
I am excited.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.585
I haven't seen my friend
shmeil in a very long time.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.353
He has a layover here tomorrow

03:08.355 --> 03:09.922
On his way to a conference
in seattle.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.356
Did you say "shmeil?"

03:11.358 --> 03:13.392
Yes, tony, I said "shmeil."

03:13.394 --> 03:14.826
"shmeil" is a very
common name is israel.

03:14.828 --> 03:19.498
"shmeil" as in
"shmeil, shlimazel,

03:19.500 --> 03:22.201
Hasenpfeffer incorporated."

03:22.203 --> 03:23.302
Gonna do it
your way, tony?

03:23.304 --> 03:25.304
♪ we're gonna do it

03:25.306 --> 03:26.371
♪ our way

03:26.373 --> 03:29.274
Please stop whatever
it is that you're doing

03:29.276 --> 03:30.342
Because "shmeil,"

03:30.344 --> 03:31.977
Tony, is not a song.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.214
"shmeil" is a very wise
and influential man,

03:35.216 --> 03:37.316
And I happen to share things
with him that I wouldn't

03:37.318 --> 03:38.984
Dream of sharing
with anyone else.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.919
Present company
obviously excluded.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.790
I'm talking about
the new "us" here, ziva.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.459
You know, the
post-elevator "us,"

03:47.461 --> 03:49.361
The open book,
baring our souls,

03:49.363 --> 03:52.364
Telling each other
all kinds of personal stuff.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.234
I appreciate that, tony.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.703
But do not try to compete
with my shmeil.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.304
Do you hear that tim--
there's no

03:59.306 --> 04:02.441
Getting between ziva
and her schmeil.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.542
It is too early for this.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.377
It's too early
for a lot of things.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.678
Something big, boss?

04:06.680 --> 04:09.414
Got a dead navy officer
in franconia.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.251
And a child abduction,
let's go.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.553
Mm, that is bad.

04:15.855 --> 04:17.923
Single gunshot
to the abdomen,

04:17.925 --> 04:19.758
Preceded by
a fierce struggle.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.294
Look at these abrasions.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.395
From the look of things,

04:23.397 --> 04:25.530
All this happened
rather quickly.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.733
Mcgee: Victim is
navy captain david wade.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.368
He lives on fort belvoir.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.003
He was just picking up
his daughter from work.

04:31.005 --> 04:33.338
Check for
surveillance footage.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.706
Movie theaters
might have cameras.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.841
On it, boss.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.709
Poor man paid
with his life.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.279
The least we can do is try
to find his daughter.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.947
Actually, she's not
the one missing.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.949
It's her friend rose martin.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.051
Cops found her cell phone
dumped in a gutter

04:46.053 --> 04:47.452
About a block from here.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.654
Where's captain wade's
daughter?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.355
Lydia.

04:50.357 --> 04:53.892
Over there on
the bench, boss.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.395
Excuse me.

04:56.397 --> 04:59.865
We're special agents david
and gibbs with ncis.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.633
I want my mom.

05:03.002 --> 05:05.671
Her mother's in an aircraft
carrier on the arabian sea.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.874
Jenni's navy...
Like dave.

05:10.843 --> 05:13.478
We'll get her back as
soon as possible, okay?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.613
What about our rosie?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.481
Your rosie's mom?

05:16.483 --> 05:17.883
You're gonna get
her back, right?

05:17.885 --> 05:20.552
Of course they will.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.453
They'll find her.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.554
Am I right?

05:22.556 --> 05:23.755
We'll do all we can.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.324
Commander scott martin,
u.S. Navy.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.426
That's my wife connie.
I was on the phone last night

05:27.428 --> 05:28.393
With dave when it happened.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.494
Damn it! Why the hell

05:29.496 --> 05:30.662
Didn't I just come with him?

05:30.664 --> 05:33.699
What are you talking about,
what difference would--
commander, breathe.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.434
Breathe, breathe.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.868
I know this is hard on you.

05:36.870 --> 05:40.872
We need you to stay calm
and tell us what you know.
Okay, all right.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.642
Dave was here, picking the girls
up from their jobs.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.644
We've been neighbors
three years, so we trade off

05:45.646 --> 05:47.512
Taking them to school,
and work and volleyball...

05:47.514 --> 05:51.416
A little past 0300--
stupid midnight show.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.452
You said you were on the phone.
Yes, I was
just checking in.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.854
All I heard was "uh-oh"
or "oh, no," and then lots

05:55.856 --> 05:56.922
Of screaming
and shouting until...

05:56.924 --> 05:58.590
What about after that?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.592
Tires squealing, more screams.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.561
We got here
as fast as we could.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.531
Lydia, you ever see
these guys before?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.567
Hey, kid, look at me.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.435
You think you
can describe them?

06:10.437 --> 06:13.572
Martin:
Lydia, you have to, you have to.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.640
Your father was my best
friend in the world,

06:15.642 --> 06:17.476
And I know he would want you
to do everything you could

06:17.478 --> 06:18.744
To help rosie
right now.
Scott, don't do that.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.745
Do what?
Just stop.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.047
Somebody out there
has our daughter!

06:22.049 --> 06:23.548
Lydia:
Daddy tried!

06:24.484 --> 06:27.452
He tried to stop them!
He tried!

06:27.454 --> 06:30.455
He tried to save rosie!
Daddy tried!

06:30.457 --> 06:32.524
It's okay, sweetie,
we know.
Ziva: We know that.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.460
We know, sweetie,
we know.

06:35.462 --> 06:38.530
Please... Please
find our daughter.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.599
We won't stop till we do.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.475
Gibbs: At least we got some
decent video, for once.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.544
Theater just upgraded
their surveillance system.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.912
That's enough.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.648
Okay, so that's who
we're after-- two men

06:56.650 --> 06:59.651
In a black van;
probably a driver, too.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.886
One missing girl.

07:00.888 --> 07:01.887
Tony:
Rose martin, 16.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.889
Check your e-mails

07:03.891 --> 07:05.090
For more photos and info.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.892
Bolos, apbs already been issued,

07:06.894 --> 07:08.827
And the fbi is on board as well.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.430
Director vance authorizes
all ncis agents

07:11.432 --> 07:13.432
To drop what they're doing
and join the search.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.467
We've got 48 hours,
people.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.502
Let's go.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.472
Those stocking masks make
facial enhancement tricky, boss.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.807
Hopefully, abby can do better.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.809
The least we can do is I.D.
That license plate.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.510
Mcgee: It looks to me like
there's no plate at all.

07:25.512 --> 07:28.647
Either way, it means this
was no spur-of-the-moment

07:28.649 --> 07:29.915
Drunken joyride.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.483
No, they had a plan.
Grab a
couple girls

07:31.485 --> 07:32.751
Off the street at random?

07:32.753 --> 07:33.919
Or they were targeted.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.954
Ziva:
Hey, gibbs?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.022
They got through.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.090
(computer beeps)

07:40.126 --> 07:42.594
You got to be strong, baby,
for daddy, okay?

07:42.596 --> 07:44.062
I know you can do it.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.465
Commander jennifer wade,

07:46.467 --> 07:48.467
This is special agent gibbs.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.235
We're sorry
for your loss, ma'am.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.604
Just get these bastards,
agent gibbs.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.140
And find rosie, please.
That's all we care about now.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.475
Your transport has
been arranged?

07:56.477 --> 07:57.876
It was.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.512
Severe weather is delaying
flights on and off the ship

08:00.514 --> 08:01.680
For at least another day.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.216
I am so sorry, lydie.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.985
I want to be there
so bad right now, but...

08:06.987 --> 08:09.788
You just stay
with connie and scott

08:09.790 --> 08:11.923
And help them
in any way you can, okay?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.091
I wouldn't advise
that, commander.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.092
What?

08:14.094 --> 08:15.927
The martins are like family.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.529
And with their
daughter kidnapped,

08:17.531 --> 08:19.264
They all have a lot
on their plate.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.866
So does lydie.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.001
Is there a grandparent or
someone else we could call?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.903
Uh, no one nearby.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.706
Dave's parents are gone,
my family's on the west coast...

08:27.708 --> 08:29.007
Where will she stay?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.142
With me.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.079
If it's okay with lydia.

08:37.283 --> 08:38.917
You sure, lyd?

08:38.919 --> 08:41.620
Yeah.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.755
I'll be all right.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.561
Single .38 round
through his liver.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.296
Captain wade didn't
suffer long,

08:51.298 --> 08:53.231
If there can be
a silver lining.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.100
Nah, there can't. Bullet?

08:55.102 --> 08:57.068
Well, abby would
have that.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.203
Why'd you call me?

08:58.205 --> 09:01.072
Paint-- what I thought was dirt

09:01.074 --> 09:02.874
Beneath the captain's
fingernails is,

09:02.876 --> 09:04.209
In fact, black primer.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.912
Likely embedded
during the struggle.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.014
It dissolved in water.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.549
So I think we can assume

09:10.551 --> 09:12.684
That the paint job was
only temporary.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.185
Then this van could be
any color now?

09:14.187 --> 09:16.021
Breathe, jethro.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.991
I couldn't help overhearing what
you said to that girl's father.

09:19.993 --> 09:23.028
May I suggest that
you take your own advice?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.829
I'll breathe when she's back.

09:24.831 --> 09:29.067
That firefighters never run
into a burning building.

09:29.069 --> 09:33.772
They walk, lest their haste
result in critical errors.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.240
This girl's not a fire, duck.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.708
No, she's the building.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.877
Her captors are the fire.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.745
You want to put them out?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.080
Walk.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.184
Abby?

09:46.186 --> 09:48.253
Oh, ziva.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.888
I didn't expect you so soon.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.023
Abby:
Hi.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.692
You must be lydia.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.193
I'm abby.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.228
Look, I'm really sorry
about your dad.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.997
Thanks.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.700
Me, too.

10:01.702 --> 10:05.036
We were hoping you might swab
lydia's clothing for any clues.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.605
It might be
a little late.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.606
Will that be okay with you?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.208
If it helps find rosie,
swab away.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.078
Is this how
you were dressed when...

10:13.080 --> 10:15.046
You... Rosie...

10:15.048 --> 10:18.149
Uh...
Actually, I was...

10:18.151 --> 10:19.250
Wearing this.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.087
Oh, well...

10:22.089 --> 10:24.656
Very kitschy cool.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.890
Can I just

10:25.892 --> 10:27.292
Take it and analyze
the whole thing?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.060
You can burn it
for all I care.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.695
Okay.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.399
Lydia:
What's that?

10:34.401 --> 10:37.102
Oh, that's just a little

10:37.104 --> 10:40.005
Metal thingy.
It's a bullet.

10:41.407 --> 10:44.776
You know, um, abby's also
quite gifted at constructing

10:44.778 --> 10:47.212
Facial composites.
I dabble a little.

10:47.214 --> 10:50.415
I know the guys had stockings
over their faces, but...

10:50.417 --> 10:54.085
If you could remember
any features at all,

10:54.087 --> 10:58.156
I think we could make
a pretty distinct likeness.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.724
Lydia?

10:59.726 --> 11:02.260
(crying):
All I can see is my dad.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.733
To think of all the times

11:08.735 --> 11:12.037
I wanted to take
rosie's phone away.
It came back negative

11:12.039 --> 11:14.239
For prints-- our techs
are still combing through

11:14.241 --> 11:15.707
Recent calls and
text messages.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.175
Scott: What about
lydia's phone?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.377
We brought in rosie's
computer like you asked.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.180
Are you checking all
of lydia's stuff, too?
Absolutely.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.949
We're also monitoring both
your cells and your home phone

11:24.951 --> 11:26.951
For any potential
ransom calls.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.420
I'll give them
anything.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.156
Do you honestly think our girls
could know these monsters?

11:31.158 --> 11:33.091
Tony:
Unfortunately, "know"

11:33.093 --> 11:35.226
Is a relative term,
when it comes to the internet.

11:35.228 --> 11:39.464
You always think it
happens to other people.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.099
Mcgee:
Hold on.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.400
Who's john stevens?

11:44.103 --> 11:46.304
Goes by the screen name
"diesel."

11:46.306 --> 11:48.373
They've been chatting for weeks.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.175
That's a friend of rosie's?

11:50.177 --> 11:53.344
Their conversations
seem mostly one-sided.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.346
Last one was yesterday,
with diesel asking

11:55.348 --> 11:57.248
If rosie's working
the midnight show.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.452
"maybe I'll just have
to catch a movie tonight."

12:00.454 --> 12:03.121
Tony:
"maybe catch you, too."

12:03.123 --> 12:04.823
Where is he?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.191
We've got this,
commander.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.962
Man:
Hey.

12:10.964 --> 12:16.267
I can get you a pretty sweet
deal on a pumpkin, huh?

12:16.269 --> 12:17.502
(girls speak quietly)

12:17.504 --> 12:19.237
Eh... (scoffs)

12:19.239 --> 12:22.307
You got a deal for <i>me,</i> diesel?

12:22.309 --> 12:25.276
How do you know
that name, champ?

12:25.278 --> 12:28.213
Why? You only give it out
to teenage girls?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.448
(hawking)

12:30.450 --> 12:32.851
Go to hell,
you son of a...

12:32.853 --> 12:35.153
(grunts)

12:35.155 --> 12:38.089
Boss, I thought you
said you'd wait for me.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.891
Yeah.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.426
I tried.

12:51.872 --> 12:56.407
But I sure as hell know that I'm
gonna be suing your stupid ass.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.009
Knock yourself out.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.410
Too late for that.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.313
You know, I got
to say, diesel,

13:02.315 --> 13:04.783
You're pretty cocky
for a registered sex offender.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.018
(scoffs) it was
a bogus charge.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.120
Cop caught me peeing
on a dumpster.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.955
Dumpster next
to a middle school.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.824
We've got weeks of
your little chats

13:12.826 --> 13:14.159
With rosie.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.128
Trying to pass yourself off
as a college freshman now?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.197
I went to juco
for a semester.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.166
Gibbs: That was
12 years ago.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.168
You're 30 now,
and trolling teenagers.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.570
(sighs)
little liar.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.272
Swore she was 20.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.073
That's funny;
we must've missed that.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.075
Yeah.
Gibbs:
You talk to rosie

13:31.077 --> 13:33.178
At the movies last night?
Not much.

13:33.180 --> 13:37.816
She was acting all busy,
scooping popcorn and stuff.

13:37.818 --> 13:38.917
(wry laugh)

13:38.919 --> 13:40.451
Hell, I can take a hint.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.986
No means no; I get it.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.521
I don't think you get
much of anything.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.991
I think you and your buddies
came back after closing.
No, sir.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.960
I left there
and went straight to work.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.262
Been breaking down my boss's
pumpkin stands all night

13:51.264 --> 13:52.931
From maryland on down to here.

13:52.933 --> 13:56.000
You got one chance,
diesel.

13:56.969 --> 13:59.237
Gibbs:
You know anything at all

13:59.239 --> 14:01.940
About where to find
rosie martin and you tell me,

14:01.942 --> 14:04.309
And I will get
those dumpster charges dropped.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.444
You can do that?

14:07.913 --> 14:09.914
Where is she?

14:09.916 --> 14:12.317
(chuckles softly)
I wish I knew.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.118
That stupid sex
offender web site

14:14.120 --> 14:16.988
Makes it so damn hard
to meet chicks.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.089
(laughs)

14:18.091 --> 14:19.624
(snorts, laughs)

14:26.298 --> 14:27.999
Diesel the weasel.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.034
Yeah, he was
at the movie last night,

14:30.036 --> 14:31.636
But rosie didn't pay him
any attention.

14:31.638 --> 14:35.106
Could he be one of
the men in the van?
Maybe.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.374
The whole thing's
such a blur.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.643
The only face
I keep seeing is my...

14:40.145 --> 14:41.880
(sighs):
I'm sorry I'm not help.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.481
Don't be.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.218
What you're going through,
I would wish on no one.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.254
You've been there?

14:49.256 --> 14:52.090
Loss is a part of life.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.959
But I would never claim
to know exactly how you feel.

14:54.961 --> 14:58.229
You lost your father;
I lost my siblings.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.199
But how we each
respond is a...

15:01.201 --> 15:03.601
Very personal thing.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.505
Was it hard to get over?

15:07.507 --> 15:10.642
One gets over
the loss of a wallet...

15:10.644 --> 15:12.644
Or a watch.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.680
But a loved one...

15:15.682 --> 15:18.116
They never leave you.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.254
You never get over;
you only get through.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.990
How?

15:25.992 --> 15:28.026
(phone chimes)

15:28.994 --> 15:30.261
(ziva laughs)

15:30.263 --> 15:31.629
By leaning on others.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.564
The comfort
of friends.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.534
One of whom
I may see tomorrow.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.103
I wish I could talk
to my friends. (sniffles)

15:39.105 --> 15:41.406
Abby:
This might help.
(sighs)

15:41.408 --> 15:43.041
Oh, my phone!

15:43.043 --> 15:45.310
Abby, you're the best!

15:46.545 --> 15:48.379
The technicians
were done with it,

15:48.381 --> 15:50.481
So I figured I would grab it.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.683
Any news?

15:51.685 --> 15:54.319
They're still checking
diesel's alibi,

15:54.321 --> 15:56.587
But I didn't find
any black paint on his van.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.289
So we're back to square one?

15:59.258 --> 16:02.026
(sniffles)
lydia, what's wrong?

16:02.028 --> 16:03.594
Oh.

16:03.596 --> 16:07.398
I don't know why I expected
something from rosie.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.500
Force of habit, I guess.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.669
We text day and night.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.137
Any other messages?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.639
Tons.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.341
Friends asking
if I'm okay,

16:16.343 --> 16:19.510
Where I am, where rosie is.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.245
(chuckles):
Oh, my god.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.581
They're putting
a rally together.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.284
Some kind of vigil for my dad
at the belvoir bowl.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.252
The bowling alley.
My dad's in a league

16:28.254 --> 16:29.554
On Friday nights
with rosie's dad.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.322
Do you think I could go?

16:33.392 --> 16:35.159
We can ask gibbs.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.763
Girl:
There she is!

16:38.765 --> 16:42.400
We've been so worried
about you!
I can't believe you're here!

16:42.402 --> 16:45.370
Lydia, you're here!
Oh, my god!

16:45.372 --> 16:47.138
Hey, look what we did.
Come here.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.539
This is good
for her, gibbs.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.241
She needs the support.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.310
We might find out
something we don't know.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.379
Yeah, let's concentrate
on her, huh?

16:54.381 --> 16:56.381
Oh, thank god
you're okay!

16:57.349 --> 16:59.150
This is ginny.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.585
She runs the place.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.453
They're ncis.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.788
Ginny:
Ncis, fbi,

17:03.790 --> 17:07.025
State police have
all been in here today.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.761
Stuff like this just
doesn't happen in this town.

17:09.763 --> 17:11.529
It's terrible.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.464
Fred, you got
any tissues

17:13.466 --> 17:17.135
Lydia:
Who's idea was all this?

17:17.137 --> 17:20.071
It just came together.

17:20.073 --> 17:23.074
That's what good neighbors do
in tough times.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.709
Especially for guys
like your dad.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.344
I'm so sorry,
lydie-kid.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.479
(crying):
I know. Thanks, fred.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.381
Everybody loved dave
around here.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.649
We can see that.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.683
Same with
scott and connie.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.118
I can't imagine
the nightmare

17:34.120 --> 17:35.520
They're going through
right now.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.388
Connie:
Lydia?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.457
Lydia?

17:39.459 --> 17:43.094
Lydie. Hi, sweetie.
You okay?
Yeah.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.262
Did you talk
to your mom?

17:44.264 --> 17:48.199
It's fine now. The agents
are taking good care of me.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.801
Scott: Yeah,
we can see that.

17:49.803 --> 17:52.336
What are you doing here,
instead of out there
looking for rosie?

17:52.338 --> 17:53.771
There's a lot of agents
out there, commander.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.640
You got to trust that
every effort's being made.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.175
I don't.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.511
Hey, scott, take it easy.
Let me buy you a drink, huh?

18:00.513 --> 18:02.513
I don't need a drink, damn it,
I need my daughter.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.415
Go.
Scott:
All right,

18:04.417 --> 18:06.150
You got a description
of these guys, right?

18:06.152 --> 18:07.218
What else do you need?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.619
Wait a minute, lydia,
you gave them

18:08.621 --> 18:10.488
A description, right? Lydie!
Leave her alone.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.791
You got to tell them
what you saw! She saw them!

18:13.793 --> 18:15.560
She saw those bastards.
She's gotta tell them!
Agent gibbs!

18:17.629 --> 18:20.164
She can't describe them,
can she?

18:20.166 --> 18:21.466
The men,
their faces.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.167
We're working on it.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.369
Seeing your father die,
it's not easy.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.871
But we're running
out of time.

18:26.873 --> 18:30.174
I've seen bad turn to
good plenty of times.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.210
You just can't lose faith,
all right?

18:33.178 --> 18:34.512
Okay.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.447
Okay.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.450
Stupid phone hasn't
stopped since we left.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.219
One text and tweet
after another.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.787
Everybody freaking out
about everything.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.655
Kind of glad
I missed that party.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.390
Ziva:
Do you really find it necessary

18:46.392 --> 18:47.725
For lydia to look
at mug shots again?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.494
Well, they're not mug shots.

18:49.496 --> 18:53.231
Uh, well, they are mug shots,
but for our purposes,

18:53.233 --> 18:56.767
Like if somebody
has narrow eyes or big ears

18:56.769 --> 19:01.139
If any of that reminds lydia
of the guys in the van,

19:01.141 --> 19:02.473
Then we have a start.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.542
After what
rosie's dad said,

19:04.544 --> 19:05.776
I'm willing
to try anything.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.146
(phone chimes)

19:08.914 --> 19:11.149
Lydia:
Oh, my god.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.917
What is it?
It's her!
It's rosie!

19:12.919 --> 19:14.552
She's alive!

19:14.554 --> 19:17.922
Mcgee: Looks like it was sent
from a prepaid burn phone.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.590
Put it up.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.326
Tony:
That's just outside

19:22.328 --> 19:24.428
Fairfax station--
not much around there.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.463
Zooming in.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.832
(blipping, trilling)

19:27.834 --> 19:29.767
What's that little box?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.569
It's not a box;
it's a trailer.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.504
Mcgee, give us a route.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.839
Let's go.
Come on.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.282
(knocking on door)
ncis!

19:44.284 --> 19:46.651
Clear.
Mcgee:
Dead body, boss.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.924
Tony:
Clearly disgusting.

19:52.926 --> 19:55.293
Not cold. Recent.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.529
Receipts from
a discount clothing store.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.497
Lots of duct tape.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.598
She was here.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.334
They cut her loose
so she could eat.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.340
It's the burn phone,
with rosie's outgoing text.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.975
Tony: She sneaks half
a message to lydia

20:10.977 --> 20:12.376
From this loser's phone,

20:12.378 --> 20:13.678
Loser gets whacked
for letting it happen.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.746
The other kidnapper
takes off with rosie.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.615
The question is: Where?

20:25.991 --> 20:28.693
The girl's still out there;
clock's ticking.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.529
We're all spread a little
thin on this one, ducky,

20:31.531 --> 20:33.731
So I wanted to check on
stinky here personally.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.701
(chuckles) yeah, he is
rather pungent, isn't he?

20:36.703 --> 20:38.502
Ever wish you could
just wake up a dead guy

20:38.504 --> 20:39.937
So he can tell you
what you need to know?

20:39.939 --> 20:42.740
I don't have to wish;
it's what I do.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.909
Sans the waking part.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.311
I'd need the waking, if only
to have the pleasure

20:47.313 --> 20:49.981
Of putting this creep
to sleep all over again.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.449
Ah, yes.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.585
Of all the crimes
we deal with every day,

20:54.587 --> 20:58.723
There's none more heinous
than those involving children.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.459
They enrage our sensibilities.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.960
That's putting
it nicely.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.529
Yeah, well, if
it's any comfort,

21:05.531 --> 21:08.499
This man's disdain
for personal hygiene

21:08.501 --> 21:12.503
Renders him literally caked
with information.

21:12.505 --> 21:16.907
You'll tell us something
useful, won't you?

21:16.909 --> 21:21.445
Even if I have to swab every
detestable inch of you.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.414
Mcgee:
Name's shawn oakby, boss.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.683
He was a long-time loser:
Petty theft, assaults,
drug charges--

21:25.685 --> 21:28.519
But no kidnapping,
no sex crimes.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.022
Well, he's new at this;
prone to mistakes.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.490
Well, same can't be said

21:32.492 --> 21:34.358
For whoever he called
in the last few days.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.327
(beeping)

21:36.329 --> 21:38.863
Every number gets me to
another burner or dummy device.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.665
Smarter crooks
than this dumb-ass.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.601
The phones must be turned off;
I'm not getting a signal.

21:44.569 --> 21:46.470
(groans)
what, mcgee?

21:46.472 --> 21:49.440
I just dug these photos
out of the phone's trash.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.609
Mcgee: That's
where they belong.

21:51.611 --> 21:52.843
Makeup,

21:52.845 --> 21:54.412
Party dress--
that would explain

21:54.414 --> 21:55.946
Those discount
store receipts.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.549
Gibbs: He sent these out?
Yeah.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.451
To the other burn phones.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.520
What do you think, boss?

22:04.690 --> 22:06.624
Boss?

22:06.626 --> 22:08.492
Write this down.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.761
Miranda pennebaker.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.596
Okay, who is she?

22:12.598 --> 22:14.598
These days, who knows?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.435
Call the fbi, ask fornell
where to find her.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.404
Mcgee: Boss, she's got seven
aliases, and a dozen agencies

22:20.406 --> 22:22.606
Around the world
have her on their watch lists.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.476
Then don't <i>ask</i> fornell;
<i>tell</i> him to find her.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.811
Tell him to call me.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.982
Lydia:
Yeah, that looks like him;
the one who grabbed me.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.585
Dad nailed him good.
He had the bruises
to prove it.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.821
But still no rosie?
It looks like

22:36.823 --> 22:38.089
We're getting
one step closer.

22:38.091 --> 22:41.025
This is a "women only"
kind of thing down here?

22:41.027 --> 22:42.693
Pretty intimidating, huh?

22:44.062 --> 22:45.730
Lydia, can you
give us a minute?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.064
Okay.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.807
Okay, so,
what's wrong, gibbs?

22:56.809 --> 22:58.609
They're trying to sell her.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.811
What?
They had pictures
of her-- makeup,

23:00.813 --> 23:03.714
Skimpy dress--
sent out to a buyer or buyers.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.817
Highest bidder,
maybe.
So what's the plan?

23:06.819 --> 23:09.787
She see the picture of
our dead guy's mug shot?

23:09.789 --> 23:12.456
Yeah. She recognized
him immediately.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.459
Any chance that seeing him
helped her remember his partner?
We can keep

23:15.461 --> 23:17.561
Working on that.
I want you both
to stay with her.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.698
Make her feel safe.
Abby: Where? I mean,
it's getting late.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.767
Is there a safe house
available?
My house.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.535
Your house?

23:24.537 --> 23:27.605
(phone ringing)

23:27.607 --> 23:29.073
Hey, tobias,

23:29.075 --> 23:32.009
Where is pennebaker?

23:32.011 --> 23:34.612
(siren wailing in distance)

23:46.758 --> 23:49.660
Gibbs.
How you been, penn?

23:49.662 --> 23:50.895
Now, you of all people,

23:50.897 --> 23:53.664
Should know I don't
take surprises well.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.132
How ever did you find me?

23:55.134 --> 23:57.168
Well, it was easier
than I thought.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.669
Creature of habit.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.571
I take it you
haven't tracked me down

24:00.573 --> 24:03.507
Just to catch up with my dog.
Well, it's
been a while.

24:03.509 --> 24:06.710
Any chance you remember
how we left things?

24:08.713 --> 24:11.682
The words "I owe you one"
spring to mind.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.919
Foolishly, you rebuffed my
efforts to repay your kindness

24:14.921 --> 24:17.755
In a way that most men
would consider...

24:17.757 --> 24:20.558
Mutually beneficial.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.726
You still in sales?

24:22.728 --> 24:24.895
I keep my toe in the pond.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.997
But I'm enjoying
my grandson's company

24:26.999 --> 24:30.734
Far too much to go on those
long business trips abroad.

24:30.736 --> 24:33.003
That, and your passport
got revoked.

24:34.573 --> 24:37.675
Okay, just out
of curiosity,

24:37.677 --> 24:41.212
What sort of merchandise
are you looking to move?

24:41.214 --> 24:43.614
Oh, it's not for me;
someone I'm after.

24:43.616 --> 24:46.217
A young girl.

24:46.219 --> 24:47.585
You do know
I still have

24:47.587 --> 24:48.686
This blackjack
up my sleeve.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.021
Miranda, I have seen
you sell everything

24:51.023 --> 24:54.558
From stolen jewels
to that old navy gunboat.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.126
But never a <i>girl.</i>

24:56.128 --> 24:57.761
Come on, gibbs.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.830
Of the few things I
won't do for profit,

24:59.832 --> 25:01.799
Human trafficking
tops the list.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.767
Hey, I meant nothing
by it, okay?

25:03.769 --> 25:06.637
This is a young girl;
she's barely 16.

25:06.639 --> 25:07.872
She's got parents
who care.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.740
She could be halfway
around the world,

25:09.742 --> 25:11.775
As far as I know.

25:11.777 --> 25:15.746
The only reason
I thought of you...

25:15.748 --> 25:19.517
Hell, what can I say?

25:19.519 --> 25:22.219
Time for a hail mary.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.288
Or a hail miranda.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.290
I will hail
whatever you got.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.259
Well...

25:28.261 --> 25:30.728
In that case...

25:30.730 --> 25:32.663
I do know someone.

25:32.665 --> 25:36.667
He's not into that particular
abomination, but...

25:36.669 --> 25:39.803
He certainly may know
some people who are.

25:39.805 --> 25:43.741
(sighs) just when
I thought I was out,

25:43.743 --> 25:45.943
You've dragged me
back in again.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.880
You wretched man.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.283
(sighs)

25:52.285 --> 25:54.285
(door creaks)

25:54.287 --> 25:56.587
Don't let gibbs'
decor fool you,

25:56.589 --> 25:58.756
'cause upstairs,
it's like a disco.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.791
Somehow I doubt that.

26:00.793 --> 26:03.861
(chuckles) making you wise
beyond your years.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.229
Is this his tv?

26:05.231 --> 26:06.730
Abby:
That? Oh,

26:06.732 --> 26:08.699
That is not just a tv.

26:08.701 --> 26:11.135
That tv came over

26:11.137 --> 26:12.636
On the <i>mayflower.</i>

26:12.638 --> 26:16.640
(whispering):
Wow, you're on fire
tonight, abby.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.943
I'm trying.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.747
He had it
on the western channel.
That's...

26:23.749 --> 26:25.616
Probably his only channel.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.217
And about that,
she's not joking.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.786
My dad loves westerns.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.588
Or he did.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.592
(bullets ricocheting on tv)

26:35.293 --> 26:36.994
He and gibbs would
have gotten along.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.597
I'm pretty sure my house
would look just like this

26:39.599 --> 26:41.832
If my mom weren't around
to dress it up.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.801
Oh, which reminds me,

26:43.803 --> 26:46.637
I have to get an update on your
mother's travel arrangements.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.205
Abby:
And I'm gonna

26:48.207 --> 26:50.174
Start cooking...
If you want to help me.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.775
I'm not hungry.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.777
I wouldn't mind
a shower, though.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.879
A shower-- that's
a great idea.

26:55.881 --> 26:58.716
I can get you
going on that.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.184
(intercom buzzes)

27:00.186 --> 27:03.153
Man (over intercom): Yes?
Is edgar hayes home?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.789
Yes, he is.
Who's this?

27:05.791 --> 27:07.891
The duchess of windsor.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.227
Ah. I'll be right there.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.062
(laughs)

27:12.064 --> 27:13.797
Another alias?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.833
Oh, it's an inside joke.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.902
He fancies himself a historian
of all things bawdy.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.672
He's not into
kids, right?

27:21.674 --> 27:24.908
Edgar may be many things,
but he's not a pedophile.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.946
(whispers): Miranda, are you
out of your mind?!

27:28.948 --> 27:30.848
It's great to see you,
too, edgar.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.350
Special agent gibbs, ncis.

27:33.352 --> 27:37.755
But I'm afraid I'm hosting
a very important dinner party,

27:37.757 --> 27:40.824
So, you'll have to--
woman (calls): Who is it, honey?
Invite them in!

27:40.826 --> 27:42.226
Uh, no-no need, babe.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.761
Um...

27:43.763 --> 27:44.795
It's just
a messenger.

27:44.797 --> 27:45.929
Work stuff.

27:45.931 --> 27:48.399
Don't get up.
Relax, edgar.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.768
We're not about
to tell your wife who I am,

27:50.770 --> 27:53.937
Or how many times you tried
to get me to sell you things

27:53.939 --> 27:55.973
I absolutely do not sell.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.848
What do you want?

28:04.850 --> 28:06.984
Ms. Pennebaker says you work
at the state department.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.820
Oh, no.
What else did she tell you?

28:09.822 --> 28:11.855
Nothing sordid.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.223
Some perversions are best left

28:13.225 --> 28:16.026
To the imagination.
I need your international reach.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.062
I've got a kidnapped
girl for sale.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.129
Who's in the market?

28:19.131 --> 28:20.898
How would I know that, exactly?

28:22.167 --> 28:24.868
(sighs)
goodness, I'm a bit peckish.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.004
What are you serving in there?

28:27.006 --> 28:30.908
All right, all right, just...
I'll make some calls.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.411
After dinner.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.946
I'm hungry.

28:35.948 --> 28:39.216
Now.
I'll make some calls now.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.886
But it'll still
take some time.
We don't have time.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.955
All right.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.961
(chuckles)
that was fun.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.796
Fun?

28:52.798 --> 28:54.064
You're still fun.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.867
(phone ringing)

28:56.869 --> 28:58.102
Yeah, duck?

28:58.104 --> 28:59.970
Cheerio, jethro.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.939
You'll be pleased to know
I've discovered something

29:01.941 --> 29:03.807
Of rather vital importance.

29:03.809 --> 29:08.178
Tony (normal voice): Really?
I thought that was kind of good.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.880
(high-pitched grunt)

29:09.882 --> 29:12.983
I do not say "cheerio."

29:12.985 --> 29:14.485
Got it.
(clears throat)

29:14.487 --> 29:16.954
Uh, ducky does have
some news, boss.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.889
It turns out filthy mcnasty
had some clues

29:18.891 --> 29:20.891
Stuck in those
nooks and crannies.

29:20.893 --> 29:24.528
Ducky:
Yes, the hands and forearms
in particular, jethro,

29:24.530 --> 29:27.865
All caked with a mixture
of rosin, polycarbon dust

29:27.867 --> 29:30.000
And machinery grease.
Garage mechanic?

29:30.002 --> 29:32.169
Tony:
I'd say handyman at best.

29:32.171 --> 29:36.006
Ducky:
Polycarbon dust and rosin are
often used at sporting events

29:36.008 --> 29:38.909
By athletes trying to keep
their hands dry from sweat.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.845
Well, pigpen here is certainly
no athlete, but maybe

29:41.847 --> 29:43.547
He's been hanging out
with some athletes?

29:43.549 --> 29:45.382
Ducky:
Or cricketers. No, no.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.085
Baseballers, gymnasts,
weight lifters...

29:48.087 --> 29:49.486
Bowling.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.988
Bowlers.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.156
Gibbs:
The bowling alley.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.357
Got it.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.058
I got to go.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.261
But of course.

29:59.864 --> 30:01.498
That was an excellent
frittata, my friend.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.468
Do you want seconds?
No. No, no, no.
I've had plenty.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.104
You didn't like it.
(laughs)

30:07.106 --> 30:10.040
Abby, look at this
maternal side in you.
Well, how about <i>you.</i>

30:10.042 --> 30:13.010
I walked in when you
were... Talking

30:13.012 --> 30:16.013
About... Death and your
family and everything.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.015
That was... Really amazing.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.417
I almost lost it.
But you did not.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.219
Instead, you...

30:22.221 --> 30:24.021
Walked in with
lydia's cell phone

30:24.023 --> 30:26.256
And you became
the instant hero.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.926
It's a teenage girl
and a smartphone--

30:28.928 --> 30:31.028
That is a no-brainer.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.030
You know, when
I was her age,

30:33.032 --> 30:35.399
I was about to go
into the military.

30:36.401 --> 30:38.836
I was... I was trying
to figure out

30:38.838 --> 30:42.372
Re-atomization as a mode
of safer transport.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.975
And I won my first
bowling tournament.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.110
Lydia:
You bowl?

30:47.112 --> 30:48.979
Oh, yeah.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.280
Are you feeling better?

30:50.282 --> 30:52.282
Kind of.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.618
You know
how thoughts

30:54.620 --> 30:57.020
Pop into your mind
in the shower sometimes?

30:57.022 --> 30:58.922
What? What popped?

30:58.924 --> 31:00.524
The other guy from the van,

31:00.526 --> 31:02.559
He was kind of pudgy
with a beard.

31:03.628 --> 31:05.195
I think I can describe him now.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.897
That's... Great.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.966
I'll get my laptop. Whoa!

31:08.968 --> 31:11.201
Blackout.
It would appear so.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.204
I have a flashlight in my bag,
if I can find it.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.539
I got you covered.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.642
All right!
Teenage girl
with her cell phone.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.077
There's nothing to
worry about--

31:20.079 --> 31:21.445
It's just a power outage.
Happens.

31:21.447 --> 31:24.448
We are cool.
Ziva: No, we're not cool.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.984
The streetlights are still on.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.352
So are neighboring houses.

31:28.354 --> 31:29.987
Maybe it's a fuse.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.622
(thud in distance)
(gasps)

31:31.624 --> 31:34.324
Get back upstairs. Now.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.307
Ncis! Identify yourself!

31:56.547 --> 31:58.582
(man yells, ziva grunts)

31:58.584 --> 32:00.250
(grunting)

32:00.252 --> 32:02.619
No! Where is she!

32:02.621 --> 32:05.389
That's just what
I was gonna ask you.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.491
(clang)

32:09.060 --> 32:11.261
It's a f-frying pan.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.430
It's a little cliché.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.032
Works for me.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.301
Are you guys okay?
Hand me your phone.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.002
(groans)

32:22.407 --> 32:25.142
Lydia:
Oh, my god. It's fred.

32:34.986 --> 32:38.388
(door opening)

32:38.390 --> 32:42.259
Fred: Hey, look, it was just
about the money, okay?

32:42.261 --> 32:43.727
One final score.

32:43.729 --> 32:46.496
I didn't mean for it
to get so out of hand.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.631
Out of hand like kidnapping,

32:47.633 --> 32:49.499
Murder, assaulting
a federal agent?

32:49.667 --> 32:51.201
Where's the girl?

32:51.203 --> 32:52.569
I wish I knew.

32:52.571 --> 32:55.205
I was just
the set-up man.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.108
Okay, at the last minute,
they made me drive the van, too.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.676
Who's they?

32:59.678 --> 33:02.012
A guy I met in prison.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.580
Merle.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.716
And his idiot buddy shawn.

33:05.718 --> 33:07.985
I had them in to help me
fix the pin setters.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.587
Couple weeks ago,
they came to me asking about,

33:10.589 --> 33:12.556
You know, girls.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.591
Said if I steered them
in the right direction,

33:14.593 --> 33:16.159
They'd cut me in.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.661
How much?

33:17.663 --> 33:20.263
Two girls. Half-a-mil.

33:20.265 --> 33:24.034
We only ended up with one,
but hell, even split three ways,

33:24.036 --> 33:25.635
250 k's a life-changer.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.004
Who's the buyer?

33:27.006 --> 33:29.539
Some rich freak
who likes virgins.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.408
That's his thing.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.576
Permission to hit him again?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.644
Look, I'm not proud
of myself, okay?

33:34.646 --> 33:36.079
And I-I didn't mean
for dave to get shot.

33:36.081 --> 33:37.547
I didn't even know
he was gonna be there.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.483
Ziva:
But when you heard lydia
might be able to recognize

33:39.485 --> 33:41.184
The kidnappers, you had
to do something about it.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.753
You followed them from here.
I got scared.

33:42.755 --> 33:45.689
I got desperate.
You got caught!

33:45.691 --> 33:47.591
Where's rosie?!

33:47.593 --> 33:49.626
I don't know.
You've been
to prison.

33:49.628 --> 33:52.362
You know what kind of inmates
other inmates hate the most.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.430
Child sex offenders.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.632
Use your head, fred!

33:58.536 --> 34:01.238
Isn't bert, like,

34:01.240 --> 34:03.807
The most relaxing thing?

34:03.809 --> 34:06.176
He's, like,

34:06.178 --> 34:09.346
The most zen hippo
in the whole universe.

34:13.751 --> 34:16.620
Abby, when is this gonna stop?

34:16.622 --> 34:19.756
Um... Soon? I hope.

34:19.758 --> 34:23.660
But the navy is doing
everything they can

34:23.662 --> 34:25.395
To bring your mom here.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.197
You're just gonna have
to be strong.

34:31.269 --> 34:32.803
Bet you were
an awesome teenager.

34:32.805 --> 34:35.739
I was awesomely awkward.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.475
We would have been good friends.

34:38.477 --> 34:41.211
Abby:
Would have been? Lydia,

34:41.213 --> 34:44.514
Promise me, when this
whole thing's over,

34:44.516 --> 34:46.850
Just know you still
have friends here.

34:46.852 --> 34:50.487
Me and ziva and gibbs.

34:50.489 --> 34:54.624
I mean, we may not be related,
but we can relate.

34:55.793 --> 34:56.693
Amen to that.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.162
What do you got, abbs?

34:59.164 --> 35:02.732
Something weird.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.268
I was going over
shawn oakby's labs,

35:05.270 --> 35:07.671
And I found significant doses
of dimenhydrinate.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.340
It's over-the-counter
stuff for motion sickness.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.175
Taking a little trip?

35:12.177 --> 35:16.146
I'm thinking flying
or deep sea something.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.547
Or both?
(phone rings)

35:17.549 --> 35:19.749
Yeah, dinozzo.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.485
Can you come to the squad room?

35:21.487 --> 35:24.154
Yup. I'll be right there.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.159
You ever know anybody
named shmeil?

35:29.161 --> 35:30.861
What kind of name is that?

35:30.863 --> 35:32.896
It's a respected
hebrew name, actually.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.398
Derived from the
biblical ishmael,

35:35.400 --> 35:37.267
Meaning "his name is god."

35:37.269 --> 35:39.769
She did say he was influential.

35:39.771 --> 35:40.737
Who is influential?

35:40.739 --> 35:42.873
Nobody.
Shmeil.

35:42.875 --> 35:44.274
Ziva:
Ha! Well, yes,
he certainly is,

35:44.276 --> 35:45.909
And I love him dearly for it.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.844
I loved like that once.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.846
Bet his name wasn't shmeil.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.615
His name's none
of your business.

35:51.617 --> 35:52.449
Who are you exactly?

35:52.451 --> 35:54.284
Your worst nightmare.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.352
Ziva:
Whoever she is,

35:55.354 --> 35:57.154
I like her very much.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.158
Gibbs:
You're waiting
for me, penn?

36:01.160 --> 36:03.727
Oh, only for
about 20 years.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.829
You'll be pleased to know
our man edgar sang like

36:05.831 --> 36:07.264
A proverbial canary.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.433
Your buyer's name
is claude damien...

36:10.435 --> 36:12.936
Lamonde.
Mcgee.

36:12.938 --> 36:16.406
On it.
Pennebaker: He's an aging
french-vietnamese drug dealer,

36:16.408 --> 36:18.208
A scum of the earth.

36:18.210 --> 36:21.444
When he's not profiting from
children selling his poison,

36:21.446 --> 36:22.846
He's happily
abusing them.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.214
For years he was...

36:24.216 --> 36:25.515
Mcgee:
Got him here, boss.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.883
Claude damien lamonde,

36:26.885 --> 36:28.718
Longtime resident of hanoi,

36:28.720 --> 36:30.587
Forced out in 2007.

36:30.589 --> 36:31.755
Avoiding extradition
to France,

36:31.757 --> 36:32.822
He's taken to
international waters.

36:32.824 --> 36:36.927
In a converted minesweeper,
currently located here.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.528
<i>The golden maiden.</i>

36:38.530 --> 36:41.464
It's anchored 200 nautical miles
off the virginia coast.

36:41.466 --> 36:42.299
Never anchored.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.366
Always on the move,

36:43.368 --> 36:44.568
I'd say.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.403
Or at least I was about to

36:46.405 --> 36:47.804
Before I was
so rudely interrupted.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.905
Sorry.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.740
You got more?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.509
But of course.

36:52.511 --> 36:53.877
Lamonde's helicopter's
due to arrive

36:53.879 --> 36:56.246
On the grounds of a farm
just outside reston

36:56.248 --> 36:57.948
At dawn.

36:57.950 --> 37:00.717
They are flying her out to sea,
special delivery.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.886
How's your stomach, dinozzo?

37:02.888 --> 37:05.455
Queasy just
thinking about it, boss.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.969
Come on. Move!

37:18.971 --> 37:20.503
(whimpering)

37:20.505 --> 37:22.906
Hey!

37:22.908 --> 37:24.808
Hey, I got
your pretty young thing here.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.977
All I need is my cash,
we're good to go.

37:28.346 --> 37:29.579
Gibbs:
Ncis.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.880
Let her go.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.916
(siren whoops)

37:32.918 --> 37:35.852
(horn blares)
gibbs: Let her go!

37:35.854 --> 37:37.020
Listen to the man, merle.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.722
Don't make him say it again.

37:42.627 --> 37:44.995
(grunts)
(grunts)

37:46.964 --> 37:48.999
Rosie?
Rosie!

37:49.001 --> 37:49.933
Rosie.
Mom.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.501
Dad.
(gasps)

38:07.918 --> 38:11.655
The first thing rosie wanted to
know is if you were all right.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.356
What did you tell her?

38:13.358 --> 38:16.526
I told her that you
were a very good friend.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.728
Is she back home already?
After a night

38:18.730 --> 38:20.330
In the hospital for evaluation.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.732
But her parents
are with her.
Yes.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.735
Just as your father
will always be for you.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.904
Can we go back
to that big-screen room

38:27.906 --> 38:31.041
And call my mom,
tell her the good news?

38:31.043 --> 38:33.610
Why don't you tell her now?

38:34.912 --> 38:36.913
Mom!

38:36.915 --> 38:38.715
My baby. Oh!

38:41.686 --> 38:42.886
You came back.

38:45.589 --> 38:47.657
(laughs)

38:52.330 --> 38:54.864
Pennebaker: Still making
moonshine down here?

38:54.866 --> 38:56.933
Not for years.

38:58.102 --> 39:00.370
Might be fun, though.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.474
Smells like...

39:04.476 --> 39:05.709
Wood?

39:05.711 --> 39:06.843
Like...

39:08.713 --> 39:10.347
Varnish?

39:10.349 --> 39:12.482
Quiet reflection.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.784
My own.

39:17.655 --> 39:20.590
That pond
I've kept my toe in--

39:20.592 --> 39:23.460
I'm considering

39:23.462 --> 39:25.762
Pulling it out for good.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.997
Investing in my future.

39:27.999 --> 39:31.501
A zebra...

39:31.503 --> 39:33.536
Can't change its stripes.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.572
No...

39:35.574 --> 39:37.640
But a woman can.

39:43.981 --> 39:46.516
(elevator bell dings)

39:46.518 --> 39:48.618
Took you long enough
to get back.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.019
You ever impound a minesweeper?

39:50.021 --> 39:51.755
They don't exactly have
valet parking.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.723
You look nice.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.792
Thank you.
We're going out.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.827
We?
Shmeil and I.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.095
He landed an hour ago.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.498
The mighty shmeil
has landed.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.966
He's got a lot to live up to.

40:02.968 --> 40:05.969
Can I ask, do his feet
touch the ground?

40:05.971 --> 40:07.404
(laughs)

40:07.406 --> 40:08.605
He's just a man, tony.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.006
Currently, he's actually
using the restroom.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.041
Man:
It was out of towels.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.944
Luckily, the nice man
in the hall had

40:14.946 --> 40:16.513
The janitor
bring me some.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.814
You know him, actually.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.949
He said his name was leon.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.651
Very fond of you.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.119
Tony:
Yes.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.587
That's our director.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.089
Tony dinozzo,
I want you to meet

40:26.091 --> 40:27.824
My very good friend
shmeil pinkhas.

40:27.826 --> 40:30.794
Poet, philosopher
and middle east historian.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.896
Listen to her kvelling.

40:32.898 --> 40:36.699
But who can argue
with a smile like that?

40:36.701 --> 40:38.768
(wry laugh)
dinozzo.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.537
I think I met someone
of that name

40:40.539 --> 40:42.705
At a hotel bar in geneva.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.741
An older version of you,

40:44.743 --> 40:46.810
Outgoing,
quite dashing.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.479
Let me get this straight--
you... You've met my father?

40:49.481 --> 40:50.814
(laughs)
nice kid.

40:50.816 --> 40:53.950
And such stories. Oh!

40:53.952 --> 40:56.686
Many I cannot repeat
in mixed company,

40:56.688 --> 40:57.854
But he...

40:57.856 --> 40:58.988
He had me laughing.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.990
Well, if he stuck you
with the check,

41:00.992 --> 41:02.459
Then that's our guy.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.793
Then you must

41:03.795 --> 41:04.761
Join us.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.229
Oh, gosh, no, I couldn't.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.731
Uh, you know, I'm sure you
want to be alone, and I...

41:08.733 --> 41:09.899
I have all this...

41:09.901 --> 41:11.801
Ziva:
No, we have plenty of time,

41:11.803 --> 41:13.870
And shmeil is actually
spending the night, so...

41:13.872 --> 41:15.705
Shmeil: I've known my ziva
since she was

41:15.707 --> 41:16.739
Three years old.

41:16.741 --> 41:19.042
Trust me, we'll be
talking till dawn.

41:19.044 --> 41:21.010
Oh.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.012
Dinozzo, let's party.

41:23.014 --> 41:31.087
