00:15.245 --> 00:16.430
Five minutes Sylvio.

00:37.924 --> 00:39.689
What's the ape, gonna break?

00:39.689 --> 00:41.872
What's the ape, gonna break?

00:41.872 --> 00:44.044
What's the ape, gonna break?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.932
What's the ape, gonna break?

00:45.932 --> 00:48.188
What's the ape, gonna break?

00:48.188 --> 00:50.252
What's the ape, gonna break?

00:50.252 --> 00:52.340
What's the ape, gonna break?

00:52.340 --> 00:54.257
What's the ape, gonna break?

02:06.657 --> 02:07.824
Hello?

02:08.906 --> 02:10.884
Hello, my name is Sylvio.

02:10.884 --> 02:14.289
I'm calling in regards
to your unpaid debt.

02:14.289 --> 02:16.977
No, I don't talk to computers.

02:16.977 --> 02:18.911
I am not a computer.

02:18.911 --> 02:20.161
I am a gorilla.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.250
- Merry Christmas Sylvio.

04:38.929 --> 04:42.929
♫ I have a kinship with the man

04:45.589 --> 04:49.422
♫ Does not need to understand

04:51.887 --> 04:55.470
♫ I like living here alone

04:57.551 --> 05:01.718
♫ I've disconnected all the phones

05:03.684 --> 05:07.851
♫ Unplugged the neon from the wall

05:10.260 --> 05:14.010
♫ Lead us not into withdraws

05:16.128 --> 05:20.211
♫ Don't introduce me to your kin

05:22.331 --> 05:26.414
♫ No nice to see ya, how ya been

05:48.959 --> 05:49.871
- Don't look at him.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.371
Come on, hurry up.

06:18.695 --> 06:22.278
♫ Hold a Obispo in my heart

06:24.335 --> 06:28.502
♫ Oh how I need a brand new start

06:30.896 --> 06:34.896
♫ All the sharks out in the sea

06:36.982 --> 06:40.982
♫ And the lightning bolts agree

06:48.715 --> 06:51.020
They will
have a feast next week

06:51.020 --> 06:52.399
thanks to the Salvation Army.

06:52.399 --> 06:53.565
Volunteers are going to be

06:53.565 --> 06:56.325
handing out Christmas baskets
today for those in need.

06:56.325 --> 06:58.795
Carmelo Madoloni with that story.

06:58.795 --> 07:00.459
The harsh winds
and freezing temperatures

07:00.459 --> 07:03.748
didn't stop volunteers from
giving baskets to those in need.

07:03.748 --> 07:05.224
More than two dozen volunteers

07:05.224 --> 07:07.325
packed bags with all the fixings,

07:07.325 --> 07:09.879
even to make the perfect Christmas dinner.

07:09.879 --> 07:10.712
It's helped me a lot.

07:10.712 --> 07:13.885
I understand what people go through.

07:13.885 --> 07:16.825
So it gives us a whole new
perspective for everyone.

07:16.825 --> 07:20.992
Caitlin Meque
is a high school senior.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.533
It was all part of a fundraiser
that they put together

07:54.533 --> 07:56.236
to give back to their community.

07:56.236 --> 07:59.921
Andrew Bennet is a student
and current project leader.

07:59.921 --> 08:01.864
He's happy to give back to his community

08:01.864 --> 08:03.065
during the holidays.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.309
Yeah everyone's
having a good time.

08:05.309 --> 08:06.503
We're so involved with you know,

08:06.503 --> 08:09.500
everyone looks like it's
good to see their faces

08:09.500 --> 08:10.333
when we get--

08:14.339 --> 08:15.466
It's taking care of a basic need,

08:15.466 --> 08:16.677
but it goes beyond that.

08:16.677 --> 08:18.717
If they don't have a traditional turkey

08:18.717 --> 08:20.337
or ham at Christmas time,

08:20.337 --> 08:23.817
this just makes it very special.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.233
- Cindy!

09:50.742 --> 09:51.936
Five debts collected.

09:57.051 --> 09:57.884
Sylvio!

10:16.045 --> 10:18.045
Sylvio, we need to talk.

10:19.092 --> 10:21.312
I'm taking you off the phones.

10:21.312 --> 10:23.220
I'm putting you on house visits.

10:24.336 --> 10:26.336
Here's your first house.

10:27.519 --> 10:30.192
Guy's name is Allen Reynolds.

10:30.192 --> 10:32.600
Lay it on thick with this guy Sylvio.

10:33.409 --> 10:34.659
I need results.

10:36.014 --> 10:38.668
Report back to me ASAP.

10:38.668 --> 10:39.501
Got that?

10:40.334 --> 10:41.167
Good.

11:42.354 --> 11:45.333
- I didn't know you were...

11:45.333 --> 11:46.711
You're very tall.

11:46.711 --> 11:48.679
Well come on in.

11:48.679 --> 11:50.919
Al will meet you in a second.

11:50.919 --> 11:51.935
Our second guest is arriving.

11:51.935 --> 11:54.358
Taking him to the green room now.

11:54.358 --> 11:55.191
Al took care of everything.

11:55.191 --> 11:56.718
He has it all set up for you.

11:56.718 --> 11:58.301
Just right in here.

12:02.178 --> 12:03.550
Just make yourself at home.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.633
Snacks, water, magazines?

12:08.328 --> 12:11.643
- The deer don't necessarily
like to come out at night.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.527
They're just as likely to

12:13.527 --> 12:14.923
come out during the broad daylight.

12:14.923 --> 12:15.760
Can you speak to that?

12:15.760 --> 12:16.674
- That's exactly right.

12:16.674 --> 12:18.732
They can pop out at any moment.

12:18.732 --> 12:21.787
They're lurking behind bends in the road,

12:21.787 --> 12:23.704
behind trees, anywhere.

12:24.848 --> 12:27.098
Everyone listen real close.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.373
I'm warning you.

12:30.558 --> 12:31.808
Watch the road!

12:33.066 --> 12:33.899
Boom!

12:36.876 --> 12:38.324
- Great.

12:38.324 --> 12:41.456
Okie dokey, well thanks
for joining us Tina.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.208
Highly recommended book here.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.021
Go out and get a copy at
at your local book store.

12:45.021 --> 12:47.240
Give it to a friend, a family member.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.031
Also a great gift.

12:49.031 --> 12:50.675
You never know, it could save your life.

12:50.675 --> 12:52.925
Thanks for joining us Tina.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.229
I'm terrible under stress.

13:08.229 --> 13:11.896
Would you like an
autographed copy of my book?

13:16.937 --> 13:17.770
It's okay.

13:18.870 --> 13:20.287
You can use ours.

13:38.042 --> 13:38.965
- And we're back.

13:38.965 --> 13:40.393
We're really happy to have our next guest.

13:40.393 --> 13:41.557
His name is Terrance

13:41.557 --> 13:43.863
and we're really gonna
put hit to the test today.

13:43.863 --> 13:45.721
Now we can assure you
that Terrance has not seen

13:45.721 --> 13:47.941
any of the items that
he's about to juggle.

13:47.941 --> 13:50.173
Isn't that right Terrance?

13:50.173 --> 13:53.756
Excellent, let's get
right to it, shall we?

13:55.393 --> 13:58.599
I will now remove Terrance's blindfold.

13:58.599 --> 14:00.637
Let's get this thing off.

14:00.637 --> 14:02.833
Let's cheer him on at home.

14:02.833 --> 14:06.434
Okay, and let's queue
some juggling music Jerry.

14:06.434 --> 14:08.987
I give you Terrance, the mystery juggler.

15:03.457 --> 15:04.881
- Whoa.

15:06.622 --> 15:08.205
- Oh, I'm Terrance.

15:24.837 --> 15:26.421
- Alright, sorry about that folks.

15:26.421 --> 15:27.600
We had some technical difficulties,

15:27.600 --> 15:28.823
but we're back on the air now.

15:28.823 --> 15:30.565
It's time for, you call, we talk,

15:30.565 --> 15:32.568
our community call in segment of the show.

15:32.568 --> 15:34.356
That's where we talk
about community issues,

15:34.356 --> 15:36.122
and what's going on in your community.

15:36.122 --> 15:37.477
Let's get right into some calls.

15:37.477 --> 15:39.060
Who is that gorilla.

15:39.060 --> 15:40.383
He was hilarious!

15:41.319 --> 15:43.131
What was all that stuff he was breaking?

15:43.131 --> 15:44.919
Hey, you gotta have him back.

15:44.919 --> 15:47.031
- No, he won't be coming
back, I just said that.

15:47.031 --> 15:49.276
Okay, no more calls
about the gorilla please.

15:49.276 --> 15:50.863
We're looking for community engagement.

15:50.863 --> 15:53.619
What's going on in your community?

15:53.619 --> 15:54.964
Okay we have Terra and Talsen.

15:54.964 --> 15:55.996
You're live on the air.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.652
Oh, nevermind.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.768
I didn't realize

15:58.768 --> 16:01.779
you weren't taking calls
about the gorilla anymore.

16:01.779 --> 16:05.631
I was just gonna ask if he was
gonna be on the show again.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.631
The gorilla.

16:07.576 --> 16:10.169
- Okay, looks like we're all out of calls.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.233
You wanna close it up Gerald?

16:12.233 --> 16:13.066
Okay.

16:13.066 --> 16:14.320
Thanks for tuning in.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.388
Check back in tomorrow.

16:15.388 --> 16:16.276
Same time, same place.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.109
All week, every week.

16:17.109 --> 16:20.710
The only five day a week,
afternoon show in Baltimore.

19:39.152 --> 19:39.985
If you tuned in yesterday

19:39.985 --> 19:41.455
you'll be familiar with our next guest.

19:41.455 --> 19:43.578
Sylvio Bernardi, he's
a talented performer,

19:43.578 --> 19:44.828
and today he's brought his own

19:44.828 --> 19:46.472
original puppet show to the air.

19:46.472 --> 19:48.450
Really neat stuff, really
looking forward to it.

19:48.450 --> 19:49.913
So without further ado,

19:49.913 --> 19:52.996
The Quiet Times with Herbert Herpels.

26:21.984 --> 26:22.817
- Hey Al.

26:22.817 --> 26:23.650
- Hey.

26:23.650 --> 26:24.483
- Hey.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.773
I know money's tight and I
don't wanna keep bugging you,

26:28.773 --> 26:31.497
but none of us have gotten
our checks from last week.

26:31.497 --> 26:32.330
- Mmhm.

26:33.381 --> 26:34.214
Oh yeah.

26:35.405 --> 26:36.810
I've been meaning to write you a check.

26:36.810 --> 26:38.454
I'm sorry Maggie.

26:38.454 --> 26:41.754
I just keep getting distracted.

26:41.754 --> 26:43.127
Uh, yeah.

26:43.127 --> 26:45.078
Let me just write you a check right now.

26:45.078 --> 26:46.078
- Thank you.

26:52.026 --> 26:55.386
Have you heard anything yet
from that new sponsor, or?

26:55.386 --> 26:56.493
- Yeah.

26:56.493 --> 26:57.326
- Great.

26:57.326 --> 26:58.159
- It's looking good.

26:58.159 --> 26:59.922
I just, I'm still talking to them

26:59.922 --> 27:02.062
and just, need a little bit more time.

27:02.062 --> 27:04.158
It just takes a little bit.

27:04.158 --> 27:06.678
You know, it's a long
process and you know?

27:06.678 --> 27:07.758
- Yeah.

27:09.136 --> 27:10.303
- Yeah I know.

27:12.235 --> 27:13.516
I know that you're trying.

27:13.516 --> 27:14.516
It's just...

27:17.063 --> 27:18.898
If we don't get paid,
none of us can do it.

27:18.898 --> 27:19.731
It's really not--

27:19.731 --> 27:20.564
- I know, Maggie you can just...

27:20.564 --> 27:21.950
I'll just stop you right there,

27:21.950 --> 27:23.977
because I know full well
that you need to get paid,

27:23.977 --> 27:24.841
and here's the money.

27:24.841 --> 27:25.841
- Thank you.

27:27.443 --> 27:28.332
- I'm sorry.

27:28.332 --> 27:30.286
I know I haven't been paying you on time,

27:30.286 --> 27:32.857
and I'm gonna start, and
this is all gonna work out.

27:32.857 --> 27:36.397
I just need a little bit more time okay?

28:02.719 --> 28:03.606
- [Robotic Computer
Voice] You have reached

28:03.606 --> 28:05.914
the answering machine of Sylvio.

28:05.914 --> 28:08.325
Please leave a message after beep.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.650
Hey Sylvio, it's Al.

28:10.650 --> 28:14.817
Look, I know the Herbert
segment wasn't quite as

28:14.961 --> 28:18.211
well received as we would've hoped but,

28:19.278 --> 28:20.263
I've been doing a lot of thinking,

28:20.263 --> 28:23.130
and I was wondering if maybe you and me

28:23.130 --> 28:26.637
could work together on something.

28:26.637 --> 28:30.804
Maybe figure out a way to take
the show in a new direction.

28:44.613 --> 28:45.944
Hey!

28:45.944 --> 28:46.998
Hey man, watch it.

28:46.998 --> 28:48.438
Where are you going with that hose?

28:48.438 --> 28:50.271
Hey, this is my stuff!

28:52.089 --> 28:52.922
What are you doing here?

28:52.922 --> 28:54.255
There's no fire.

28:56.251 --> 28:59.084
Hey, watch where you're going man.

29:08.029 --> 29:08.862
Oh...

29:16.227 --> 29:17.955
Peter from Curtis Bay, you're on the air.

29:17.955 --> 29:20.595
I just wanted
to say great show guys!

29:20.595 --> 29:22.287
I just have a quick question.

29:22.287 --> 29:24.954
What's the ape gonna break next?

29:25.934 --> 29:27.314
- Two words.

29:27.314 --> 29:28.851
- A movie.

29:28.851 --> 29:29.684
- King Kong.

29:34.769 --> 29:35.745
Congo!

29:41.907 --> 29:42.740
- Yeah!

29:49.061 --> 29:52.871
♫ When they fight they fight

29:52.871 --> 29:57.038
♫ And when they come
home at night they say

29:59.159 --> 30:01.992
♫ I love you baby

30:21.238 --> 30:25.174
♫ Was it too much too soon

30:25.174 --> 30:28.990
♫ Was it a little too late

30:28.990 --> 30:33.157
♫ He got the message she
left on his car in the rain

30:37.450 --> 30:41.136
♫ And then the words, they come to you

30:41.136 --> 30:43.886
♫ Drive him away

30:45.379 --> 30:48.659
♫ You just can't let it go

31:05.560 --> 31:09.134
♫ And when it all comes crashing down

31:09.134 --> 31:11.967
♫ What can you do

31:13.485 --> 31:17.600
♫ Find what you're looking for

31:17.600 --> 31:21.384
♫ And then the words, they'll come to you

31:21.384 --> 31:25.197
♫ Driving through the rain

31:25.197 --> 31:29.364
♫ But there'll be no one
there to say them to anyway

31:35.346 --> 31:37.975
♫ I love you baby

31:49.137 --> 31:50.430
- Well, what a lot of
people don't understand

31:50.430 --> 31:52.399
is that Sylvio is not
just some wild animal.

31:52.399 --> 31:55.055
He's actually a really
sensitive and talented artist.

31:55.055 --> 31:56.770
- I don't know about that.

31:56.770 --> 31:57.790
As far as I can tell,

31:57.790 --> 32:01.414
all he does is destroy
every darn thing he sees.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.479
Talented?

32:08.543 --> 32:10.822
You're not serious.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.951
♫ The brattleboro is flooding

32:20.951 --> 32:23.098
♫ For every day

32:23.098 --> 32:25.860
♫ Brattleboro is flooding

32:25.860 --> 32:27.587
♫ In every way

32:27.587 --> 32:30.526
♫ Better find a new best friend

32:30.526 --> 32:34.693
♫ You better find a new best friend

32:36.071 --> 32:38.846
♫ Brattleboro is flooding

32:38.846 --> 32:41.351
♫ And so am I

32:41.351 --> 32:45.518
♫ They're never gonna find
your baby even if they try

32:45.635 --> 32:48.697
♫ You better find a new best friend

32:48.697 --> 32:52.864
♫ You better find a new best friend

32:54.169 --> 32:56.786
♫ When all the late papers come in

32:56.786 --> 33:00.132
♫ And when they tell me it's not my fault

33:00.132 --> 33:02.663
♫ When both of our lives start humming

33:02.663 --> 33:04.712
♫ You know I think I pay my weight in salt

33:04.712 --> 33:07.974
♫ Just to have her be the same again

33:07.974 --> 33:12.141
♫ Yeah it'll never be the same again

33:13.987 --> 33:17.407
♫ You're never gonna mount
that hard drive anymore

33:17.407 --> 33:21.574
♫ You're never gonna mount
that hard drive anymore

33:26.706 --> 33:28.713
No worries, we've got you covered.

33:29.855 --> 33:34.022
We've got flush mounts,
sconces, orbs, orbs, orbs,

33:35.995 --> 33:39.412
15% off, and of course, chandeliers!

33:43.002 --> 33:44.648
For all your lighting needs,

33:44.648 --> 33:47.981
come on down to Charlotte's Chandeliers!

33:50.220 --> 33:51.913
- So, that's the commercial spot

33:51.913 --> 33:53.712
we want to air during your show,

33:53.712 --> 33:56.906
and here is the rate we we can offer you

33:56.906 --> 33:59.952
for the one month trial period.

34:02.299 --> 34:03.516
- Yeah, works for us.

34:05.131 --> 34:07.298
Oh yeah, on one condition.

34:18.331 --> 34:20.744
Today's show is brought to you
by Charlotte's Chandeliers.

34:20.744 --> 34:22.113
The best lights in the biz.

34:22.113 --> 34:25.363
Shop Charlotte's and keep the light on.

35:01.711 --> 35:02.983
Live from Clover Crest,

35:02.983 --> 35:05.251
it's The Afternoon Show with Al Reynolds,

35:05.251 --> 35:07.001
starring Al Reynolds.

35:17.991 --> 35:21.412
And now ladies and gentlemen,
your host, Al Reynolds.

35:21.412 --> 35:22.943
- Hi and welcome to The Afternoon Show.

35:22.943 --> 35:23.889
If you're new to the show,
you've come to the right place.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.259
We're happy to have you.

35:26.259 --> 35:27.831
The ape will be on soon to do his thing,

35:27.831 --> 35:29.282
but first let's check the news.

35:30.133 --> 35:30.966
This is interesting.

35:30.966 --> 35:33.549
The mayor of Albuquerque has...

35:39.096 --> 35:40.763
- Open the door sir.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.713
I can hear you inside.

35:44.728 --> 35:48.395
I have an urgent matter
to discuss with you.

35:52.068 --> 35:53.818
Allen, open the door.

35:55.212 --> 35:58.490
You face tremendous consequences
if you don't respond.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.474
Alright, the last guy
might've been a pushover,

36:00.474 --> 36:02.807
but I assure you I won't be.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.682
This says they can
repossess Al's property.

36:19.682 --> 36:21.515
That's our whole show.

36:22.527 --> 36:24.756
What are we gonna do?

36:27.293 --> 36:29.043
Copy, be right there.

36:31.984 --> 36:34.784
Okay well, I gotta tell Al.

36:37.754 --> 36:40.743
Sylvio, this is really serious.

36:40.743 --> 36:42.602
He needs to know.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.843
Well I don't know what to do.

36:45.843 --> 36:48.362
Maybe you could talk to your
boss again or something?

36:50.298 --> 36:52.048
Okay, keep me posted.

38:51.935 --> 38:54.435
- Hey man, hold up just a sec.

39:00.232 --> 39:02.232
Dawg, break this for me!

39:10.287 --> 39:11.287
I'm filming.

39:20.438 --> 39:21.844
Dude, what?

39:21.844 --> 39:23.063
I know you're that smasher gorilla dude.

39:23.063 --> 39:23.896
Smash it!

39:28.272 --> 39:29.158
- There's the man!

39:29.158 --> 39:30.657
- Hey Sylvio.

39:30.657 --> 39:32.019
I want you to meet J.J.

39:32.019 --> 39:33.135
He is a talent agent

39:33.135 --> 39:33.968
and he's interested in

39:33.968 --> 39:36.133
maybe setting up some
opportunities for us.

39:36.133 --> 39:38.486
You know, some business opportunities.

39:40.239 --> 39:41.801
Great to finally meet you.

39:41.801 --> 39:42.784
Big fan.

39:42.784 --> 39:44.190
- Why don't you guys
chat it out a little bit.

39:44.190 --> 39:45.409
See if you can come up with something.

39:45.409 --> 39:47.833
I'm gonna head down there.

39:51.055 --> 39:51.888
Oh boy.

39:53.864 --> 39:54.697
Sylvio!

39:55.879 --> 39:57.164
I love it.

39:57.164 --> 39:59.203
What's the ape gonna break?

39:59.203 --> 40:00.465
It's brilliant!

40:00.465 --> 40:01.929
You come up with that?

40:01.929 --> 40:04.082
I bet you did.

40:04.082 --> 40:07.010
Look, I'll cut to the chase.

40:07.010 --> 40:08.629
I wanna represent you.

40:08.629 --> 40:11.905
I wanna be a part of the Sylvio team.

40:11.905 --> 40:14.474
You got potential to make a lot of money.

40:14.474 --> 40:17.382
You ever think about branding?

40:17.382 --> 40:19.830
You understand what I'm saying?

40:26.406 --> 40:27.910
- Oh no, I thought you understood.

40:27.910 --> 40:29.949
We can't do Herbert on the show anymore.

40:31.822 --> 40:33.214
Yeah, I mean now that
we have our new sponsor

40:33.214 --> 40:36.484
they're looking for a
certain type of show.

40:36.484 --> 40:39.706
Unfortunately, puppet shows
aren't really the content

40:39.706 --> 40:42.517
that they're looking for.

40:42.517 --> 40:45.238
You know, I have to
make sure they're happy

40:45.238 --> 40:47.649
because that's where
the money's coming from.

40:50.123 --> 40:51.730
Look Sylvio, I'm sorry to disappoint you

40:51.730 --> 40:53.980
but this is a new show now.

40:54.859 --> 40:55.807
It's not like the old days

40:55.807 --> 40:57.011
where we could just do whatever we want.

40:57.011 --> 41:00.046
You know, we have to stick to the script.

41:00.046 --> 41:02.046
You see what I'm saying?

41:07.272 --> 41:09.522
Let's get you into costume.

41:37.032 --> 41:39.248
Take the bat.

42:12.204 --> 42:14.969
Smash the guitar, gorilla!

42:14.969 --> 42:16.752
What's the ape gonna break?

42:16.752 --> 42:18.048
It's Brilliant!

42:18.048 --> 42:20.100
Did you come up with that one?

42:20.100 --> 42:21.736
Look, Sylvio I'm
sorry to disappoint you,

42:21.736 --> 42:23.454
but this is a new show now.

42:23.454 --> 42:24.424
It's not like the old days

42:24.424 --> 42:25.740
when we could just do
whatever we want you know?

42:25.740 --> 42:28.323
We have to stick to the script.

45:43.996 --> 45:46.144
- Tony, did you settle
the Allen Reynolds debt?

45:46.144 --> 45:46.977
- No sir.

45:48.950 --> 45:52.617
- Did anyone settle the
Allen Reynolds debt?

45:56.497 --> 45:58.681
Then why is it listed under settled debts?

45:58.681 --> 45:59.681
- I don't know,

45:59.681 --> 46:02.033
but this guy hasn't paid.

46:02.033 --> 46:05.616
Haven't gotten him to
even answer the door.

46:12.079 --> 46:12.996
- Sylvio...

46:23.339 --> 46:24.172
- Sylvio!

46:27.345 --> 46:28.595
Come on Sylvio.

46:41.465 --> 46:42.298
Listen

46:44.096 --> 46:45.640
I spoke with Charlotte.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.984
I explained the whole situation to her.

46:46.984 --> 46:49.567
She's gonna let us air Herbert.

46:50.452 --> 46:53.064
I'm serious, we're all set.

46:58.572 --> 46:59.405
Sorry.

47:02.649 --> 47:06.020
I was thinking we could
give Herbert his own slot,

47:06.020 --> 47:08.456
and you could do whatever
you want with it.

47:08.456 --> 47:09.789
No interference.

47:11.888 --> 47:13.940
That sound good?

47:16.813 --> 47:17.646
I'm sorry.

47:26.088 --> 47:27.885
I don't know, maybe just
one episode or something

47:27.885 --> 47:32.052
you could, have Herbert polishing
a chandelier or something.

47:33.430 --> 47:35.901
But we'll figure that all out.

47:35.901 --> 47:40.068
The main thing is, I want
you to be a part of this.

47:45.780 --> 47:46.613
Oh my god.

47:50.109 --> 47:50.942
What Maggie?

47:50.942 --> 47:51.778
I'm in the middle of something.

47:51.778 --> 47:55.696
- You have to come back,
they're taking everything.

47:55.696 --> 47:56.529
Al?

48:37.527 --> 48:38.360
- Hey!

48:39.315 --> 48:42.648
Hey, what are you doing with that stuff?

49:10.659 --> 49:11.740
This is all my equipment.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.573
Sir, I'm sorry.

49:12.573 --> 49:13.406
I'm sorry.

49:23.544 --> 49:25.127
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

50:06.685 --> 50:07.518
- Boom!

50:27.983 --> 50:29.816
♫ See

50:33.994 --> 50:35.827
♫ See

50:44.232 --> 50:46.315
♫ We can

50:49.140 --> 50:52.307
♫ Accomplish anything

50:54.167 --> 50:57.334
♫ We put our minds toward

53:44.165 --> 53:45.571
- Hands, hands, show me your hands!

53:45.571 --> 53:46.404
Show me your hands.

53:46.404 --> 53:47.237
Get out of the car.

53:47.237 --> 53:48.207
Get out of the car now!

53:48.207 --> 53:49.289
Get out of the car.

53:49.289 --> 53:50.122
Turn around.

53:50.122 --> 53:51.102
Put your hands against the van.

53:51.102 --> 53:52.738
Put your hands against the van.

53:52.738 --> 53:54.238
Hands behind back.

54:15.670 --> 54:16.503
You're lucky.

54:16.503 --> 54:19.253
They're not pressing any charges.

54:20.639 --> 54:24.056
Do you know anybody that can pick you up?

55:14.147 --> 55:16.230
- I hate to ask this but,

55:18.828 --> 55:22.995
well since I'm technically
not a home owner anymore,

55:25.595 --> 55:26.428
you think I could,

55:26.428 --> 55:30.095
maybe stay at your place
for a little while?

55:34.487 --> 55:35.320
Yeah?

55:37.800 --> 55:38.929
You sure?

57:06.024 --> 57:06.857
J.J.?

57:08.870 --> 57:09.703
J.J. what?

57:12.409 --> 57:13.370
The show?

57:15.853 --> 57:16.705
You wanna get the show back?

57:21.937 --> 57:23.020
- Look, here's the deal.

57:23.020 --> 57:24.459
You're in set back mode, okay?

57:24.459 --> 57:26.078
But that's not a bad thing.

57:26.078 --> 57:27.255
Alright, you're still hot.

57:27.255 --> 57:28.958
You're still on people's radar,

57:28.958 --> 57:31.033
but you gotta move quickly, okay?

57:31.033 --> 57:33.350
I'd say you got a two, three month window

57:33.350 --> 57:35.849
before people start to
forget about you, okay?

57:35.849 --> 57:37.601
So you gotta strike while the iron's hot.

57:37.601 --> 57:40.888
Saturation, heavy, you know what I mean?

57:40.888 --> 57:43.584
But you gotta be willing to play ball.

57:49.390 --> 57:50.975
Yeah?

57:50.975 --> 57:53.308
Okay, let's make some money.

57:55.610 --> 57:57.844
- You know, you are a gorilla.

57:57.844 --> 57:59.592
You are a beast.

58:00.624 --> 58:01.983
Give me mean.

58:01.983 --> 58:03.400
Give me powerful.

58:04.301 --> 58:05.801
Show me toughness.

58:07.096 --> 58:10.564
These paper towels don't
wilt under the pressure.

58:10.564 --> 58:12.564
They defeat the wetness.

58:13.460 --> 58:16.377
They don't let the wetness through.

58:17.415 --> 58:19.874
Show me impenetrable.

58:22.059 --> 58:24.254
Alright everyone, let's reset.

58:24.254 --> 58:25.793
Back to one if you will.

58:25.793 --> 58:28.960
Let's bring light three in two inches.

58:30.135 --> 58:32.302
- 35 Baker, take 12, mark.

58:34.034 --> 58:35.201
- And, action!

58:38.707 --> 58:40.243
- No, no come on.

58:40.243 --> 58:42.079
We need more aggression!

58:42.079 --> 58:43.256
You're lifeless.

58:43.256 --> 58:45.858
Come on, are you a gorilla or a baby?

58:45.858 --> 58:47.179
More reckless, more anger!

58:47.179 --> 58:49.429
We need more, now get mean.

58:50.514 --> 58:53.479
Come on, yeah, show me your teeth!

58:53.479 --> 58:56.011
Look, this is for a cereal box.

58:56.011 --> 58:57.371
This is big time!

58:57.371 --> 58:59.288
Prime time, get mean!

59:00.847 --> 59:01.728
You're a gorilla.

59:01.728 --> 59:03.145
You're a gorilla!

59:18.002 --> 59:19.002
- Two kings.

59:24.789 --> 59:25.843
How do you like your eggs Sylvio?

59:27.751 --> 59:28.687
Scrambled?

59:29.520 --> 59:30.353
Got it.

59:33.077 --> 59:36.948
Sylvio, you have some really good albums.

59:36.948 --> 59:39.564
This is a collector's item, you know that?

59:39.564 --> 59:40.908
Sylvio, can you beat this boss?

59:42.906 --> 59:44.656
Alright, here you go.

1:00:09.667 --> 1:00:10.843
Sylvio and I brought you here today

1:00:10.843 --> 1:00:13.343
because we have some big news.

1:00:15.198 --> 1:00:17.736
We're bringing the show back.

1:00:19.279 --> 1:00:23.446
One night only, in front
of a live studio audience,

1:00:25.435 --> 1:00:28.496
and all we need to know from you is,

1:00:28.496 --> 1:00:29.413
are you in?

1:00:31.063 --> 1:00:31.896
- Cool.

1:00:32.816 --> 1:00:33.649
- I'm in.

1:00:35.071 --> 1:00:35.904
- Me too.

1:00:38.744 --> 1:00:40.530
- Oh come on Maggie.

1:00:40.530 --> 1:00:42.697
I can't do it without you.

1:01:12.128 --> 1:01:15.259
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:01:24.007 --> 1:01:25.924
- Last chance dumb ass.

1:01:28.469 --> 1:01:30.544
- Alright, you guys need to
pack up your little game here

1:01:30.544 --> 1:01:31.377
and get out.

1:01:32.210 --> 1:01:33.043
- You will you little punk!

1:01:33.043 --> 1:01:34.726
He's not gonna break anything for you.

1:01:34.726 --> 1:01:36.225
- Why, it's what he does!

1:01:37.569 --> 1:01:39.441
- Alright, it's your last chance.

1:01:39.441 --> 1:01:40.498
I'm gonna call the cops.

1:01:44.277 --> 1:01:45.321
- Ooh!

1:02:25.877 --> 1:02:26.877
- Oh my god!

1:02:28.841 --> 1:02:30.424
- This is just atrocious.

1:02:30.424 --> 1:02:31.257
You were right.

1:02:31.257 --> 1:02:33.272
When he was a guest on
out show, you called it.

1:02:33.272 --> 1:02:34.783
He's nothing but a violent beast,

1:02:34.783 --> 1:02:36.632
and he shouldn't be
allowed on our streets.

1:02:37.988 --> 1:02:40.039
These kids are just teenagers,

1:02:40.039 --> 1:02:41.575
and this kid we hear

1:02:41.575 --> 1:02:44.179
actually broke his arm in the altercation,

1:02:44.179 --> 1:02:45.116
and it's a shame

1:02:45.116 --> 1:02:48.356
because he's a promising
young baseball star.

1:02:48.356 --> 1:02:49.762
This is just awful.

1:02:49.762 --> 1:02:50.595
- Oh no!

1:02:54.873 --> 1:02:58.605
- Don't worry mam, I've got
this crazy gorilla under control

1:02:58.605 --> 1:02:59.446
and as for this mess,

1:02:59.446 --> 1:03:01.617
the new round tree Triple
Quilted Paper Towel

1:03:01.617 --> 1:03:05.784
should do the trick, guaranteed
to clean all your problems,

1:03:06.249 --> 1:03:08.219
even the hairy ones.

1:03:08.219 --> 1:03:10.715
♫ Round tree

1:04:28.147 --> 1:04:29.252
- We're live from Blue Rock Studios

1:04:29.252 --> 1:04:31.813
where a group of protestors
have gathered in protest

1:04:31.813 --> 1:04:34.563
of Sylvio Bernardi, the local performer.

1:04:34.563 --> 1:04:37.077
Mam, why are you out
here today protesting?

1:04:37.077 --> 1:04:38.820
- Well you know, I just
think that he's horrible

1:04:38.820 --> 1:04:40.848
and violent, and it's just not a world

1:04:40.848 --> 1:04:44.015
that I want my daughter to grow up in.

1:04:49.213 --> 1:04:51.180
- Sir, why are you out here today.

1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:52.956
- That stupid animal broke my arm

1:04:52.956 --> 1:04:55.848
and now I can't pitch for three months.

1:04:55.848 --> 1:04:59.201
- You see that guy over
there in the front row?

1:04:59.201 --> 1:05:00.727
He's a producer at Laugh TV.

1:05:00.727 --> 1:05:02.043
- Okay.

1:05:02.043 --> 1:05:04.660
- He told me he might be
interested in picking up the show.

1:05:06.203 --> 1:05:09.546
- Look, I don't think I
need to say this, but,

1:05:09.546 --> 1:05:11.275
let's make it a big show tonight.

1:05:11.275 --> 1:05:12.281
High energy, smooth show.

1:05:12.281 --> 1:05:13.287
- Okay.

1:05:13.287 --> 1:05:14.537
I got it, yeah.

1:05:25.623 --> 1:05:26.456
- Yes!

1:05:27.879 --> 1:05:29.391
- Five minutes Sylvio.

1:06:03.536 --> 1:06:05.922
- I will now juggle,

1:06:05.922 --> 1:06:07.074
these three toasters.

1:06:17.806 --> 1:06:18.639
Let's do this.

1:06:53.556 --> 1:06:55.560
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:57.682
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:06:57.682 --> 1:06:59.721
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:06:59.721 --> 1:07:01.943
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:07:01.943 --> 1:07:04.041
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:07:04.041 --> 1:07:06.094
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:07:06.094 --> 1:07:08.134
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:07:08.134 --> 1:07:10.868
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:07:26.839 --> 1:07:27.845

1:07:34.781 --> 1:07:37.114
What's the ape, gonna break?

1:08:19.455 --> 1:08:21.811
- It's very important as
you live through this world.

1:08:22.767 --> 1:08:25.299
To know when, and when
not your light's on.

1:08:25.299 --> 1:08:29.466
So that you can be best doing what you do,

1:08:29.486 --> 1:08:33.049
because this light will guide you.

1:08:33.049 --> 1:08:35.426
It'll inform who you are,

1:08:35.426 --> 1:08:38.259
and when you're doing
what's right for you.

1:08:38.259 --> 1:08:42.426
As you live and grow, you'll
find out what that light is.

1:14:44.902 --> 1:14:46.116
Hello.

1:14:46.116 --> 1:14:48.540
This is Sylvio speaking.

1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:50.580
Thanks for watching,

1:14:50.580 --> 1:14:54.747
and thanks to my friends for
helping me tell my story.

1:14:55.103 --> 1:14:59.270
I just want to say, I am
not a violent gorilla.

1:14:59.483 --> 1:15:02.968
As far as I'm concerned,
all of the plants,

1:15:02.968 --> 1:15:07.135
all of the animals, everything
on this big beautiful planet

1:15:08.412 --> 1:15:10.662
can live together in peace.

1:15:11.567 --> 1:15:13.650
Thank you and good night.

1:16:15.733 --> 1:16:18.277
♫ There are people I am sure

1:16:18.277 --> 1:16:21.241
♫ That take comfort in the words

1:16:21.241 --> 1:16:25.408
♫ That what happens to
you when it's time to die

1:16:26.869 --> 1:16:29.845
♫ And you have heard the pearly gates

1:16:29.845 --> 1:16:32.724
♫ And instructions of the faith

1:16:32.724 --> 1:16:36.891
♫ Seen directions to the palace in the sky

1:16:39.146 --> 1:16:41.510
♫ But sleeping on a beach

1:16:41.510 --> 1:16:44.847
♫ Oh heaven is in reach

1:16:44.847 --> 1:16:49.014
♫ The whales are in
the deep singing softly

1:16:50.343 --> 1:16:52.925
♫ So in visiting a town

1:16:52.925 --> 1:16:55.946
♫ Or just hanging around

1:16:55.946 --> 1:16:57.771
♫ Take it down

1:16:57.771 --> 1:17:01.521
♫ Do whatever you do godly

1:17:04.967 --> 1:17:07.379
♫ There are people I am sure

1:17:07.379 --> 1:17:10.356
♫ Who seek constantly a cure

1:17:10.356 --> 1:17:14.523
♫ This happens all the
days I do my dancing

1:17:16.570 --> 1:17:19.077
♫ When you could come with me

1:17:19.077 --> 1:17:22.031
♫ I'm as happy as can be

1:17:22.031 --> 1:17:26.198
♫ And a little notoriety could help me

1:17:27.873 --> 1:17:31.078
♫ Well I go sleeping on a beach

1:17:31.078 --> 1:17:33.637
♫ Oh heaven is in reach

1:17:33.637 --> 1:17:37.804
♫ The whales are in
the deep singing softly

1:17:39.780 --> 1:17:42.648
♫ So in visiting a town

1:17:42.648 --> 1:17:45.293
♫ Or just hanging around

1:17:45.293 --> 1:17:46.980
♫ Take it down

1:17:46.980 --> 1:17:51.147
♫ Do whatever it is you do godly

1:17:51.512 --> 1:17:53.429
♫ Down

1:17:56.541 --> 1:17:59.291
♫ I take it down
