00:05.270 --> 00:07.740
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:08.840 --> 00:09.970
There you are.

00:10.070 --> 00:11.470
You don't look so good.

00:11.670 --> 00:12.740
I survived.

00:15.510 --> 00:16.580
Mom?

00:16.680 --> 00:19.050
Mom, mom!

00:20.180 --> 00:21.900
When did you eat this, mom?

00:22.100 --> 00:23.820
When did you fucking
eat this?

00:24.020 --> 00:25.860
You've ingested poison.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.060
You're gonna have
to throw up, okay?

00:33.460 --> 00:35.630
I know how hard
you tried to tell us before,

00:35.830 --> 00:38.640
and I'm sorry, brother, truly.

00:38.840 --> 00:39.900
I cracked it.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.810
"Spooks"?

00:45.010 --> 00:46.480
Oh.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.780
Why did you let him
murder my baby?

00:47.980 --> 00:49.650
Fuck.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.510
Any idea where she would
have bought her computer?

00:51.710 --> 00:53.380
Or who serviced it?
What do you call those guys?

00:53.580 --> 00:54.880
Oh, her Geek Freak.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.520
You know what you are, Brady?

00:57.590 --> 00:59.860
You're not working out.

03:13.470 --> 03:15.730
<i>There is a wait so long</i>

03:15.930 --> 03:17.990
<i>So long, so long</i>

03:18.190 --> 03:22.270
<i>You'll never wait so long</i>

03:22.470 --> 03:26.340
<i>Here comes your man</i>

<i>Here comes your man</i>

03:30.340 --> 03:32.210
<i>Here comes your man</i>

03:34.810 --> 03:36.750
Nothing on her computer
as to who might have had access

03:36.950 --> 03:38.160
and who might have serviced it.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.580
How about
where she bought it?

03:39.780 --> 03:41.320
Still running that down.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.870
So you made no progress?

03:43.070 --> 03:44.610
We will,
give us time.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.130
He just blew a person up.

03:46.330 --> 03:48.110
That isn't lost on me.

03:48.310 --> 03:51.140
No, just everything else.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.960
I am hearing
some emotion.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.400
And I'm gonna keep you close to
this case 'cause, uh, frankly,

03:57.600 --> 04:00.200
we'll take all the help
we can get, but...

04:00.400 --> 04:02.490
what I can't have
is you mucking things up

04:02.690 --> 04:04.770
with your personal feelings
for the victim.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.910
Hmm?

04:09.010 --> 04:10.100
You get that, Bill?

04:10.200 --> 04:11.280
You bring the FBI in?

04:11.290 --> 04:13.750
We're in contact, swapping
databases, but it's still local.

04:13.950 --> 04:16.350
Yeah? You watching my home?
Absolutely.

04:16.550 --> 04:18.450
Well,
maybe you shouldn't be.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.890
At least not
so fucking obviously.

04:20.089 --> 04:22.690
I mean, you think
he doesn't know you're there?

04:22.890 --> 04:23.930
He wants me.
I'm his target.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.500
Let him come, I say.
Let him come.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.870
Pete,
captain wants to see us.

04:29.070 --> 04:31.370
Keep an eye on my neighbor
while you're at it, will ya?

04:31.570 --> 04:32.250
Ida's a friend of mine.

04:32.450 --> 04:33.140
This fuck likely knows it.

04:38.270 --> 04:39.610
Thanks.

04:57.490 --> 04:59.800
Chaos.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.370
19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14...

05:04.570 --> 05:05.970
Darkness.

05:16.580 --> 05:19.450
<i>In U.S., A's for anarchy,
Not bullshit democracy</i>

05:21.920 --> 05:22.990

05:23.190 --> 05:27.190
<i>But does it mean
you're really free?!</i>

05:27.390 --> 05:30.360
<i>In U.S., A's for anarchy</i>

05:30.560 --> 05:33.160
<i>Not bullshit democracy</i>

05:33.360 --> 05:35.930
<i>I want total liberty</i>

05:36.130 --> 05:38.500
<i>I want peace and anarchy</i>

05:38.700 --> 05:39.770
<i>They tell us how to act</i>

05:39.970 --> 05:42.610
<i>Well, what they meant
was slavery</i>

05:42.810 --> 05:45.240
<i>With standards and authority</i>

05:45.440 --> 05:46.940
<i>How can you think
you're really free?</i>

05:49.810 --> 05:51.350
<i>In U.S., A's for...</i>

05:51.550 --> 05:54.180
The bomber and Mercedes killer,
one and the same?

05:54.380 --> 05:55.520
All signs point to it.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.450
We're certainly not
putting it out there yet, but...

05:57.650 --> 06:00.090
How sure are you, percentage-wise?

06:00.290 --> 06:01.270
75%.

06:01.470 --> 06:02.260
80%.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.360
I got a lot of concerned people,
including the mayor,

06:05.560 --> 06:08.460
especially with this
Edmund Mills gala coming up.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.630
We at risk there?

06:09.830 --> 06:12.000
No indiction,
but can we rule it out? No.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.170
His target outside the church was Hodges.

06:14.370 --> 06:16.870
Janelle Patterson was not
supposed to be in the car.

06:17.070 --> 06:19.040
We're not even sure if the
city center was premeditated.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.210
He might have been just cruising
around in a stolen Benz,

06:21.410 --> 06:22.310
suddenly went rogue.

06:22.510 --> 06:25.450
Wearing latex gloves
and a clown mask?

06:25.650 --> 06:28.050
This bombing at the church,
that was certainly planned,

06:28.250 --> 06:30.400
even if he missed his target.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.480
What's Hodges' role
in all this?

06:32.680 --> 06:34.950
He was working
the case back then.

06:35.150 --> 06:37.430
I'm not talking then,
I'm talking now.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.730
It's all in the report.

06:38.930 --> 06:41.860
It appears the Mercedes killer
or someone pretending to be him

06:42.060 --> 06:44.000
has tried to engage
Bill Hodges.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.500
And Bill Hodges
decided to engage back?

06:47.700 --> 06:48.800
He did nothing wrong.

06:50.270 --> 06:53.340
Last I heard, Bill Hodges' only
hobby in life was alcoholism.

06:54.340 --> 06:55.510
You're out of line.

06:55.710 --> 06:58.210
Do we have a retired detective
compromising this investigation?

06:58.410 --> 06:59.850
We do not.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.120
If anything,
the retired detective

07:01.320 --> 07:02.190
was instrumental in breaking it.

07:02.390 --> 07:04.420
And what does that say
about the two of you?

07:04.620 --> 07:08.590
This is where, if I didn't
care about my pension,

07:08.790 --> 07:10.490
I'd tell you
to go fuck yourself.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.990
Hundreds of people
are expected to be on hand

07:23.190 --> 07:25.310
for the Edmund Mills gala
this weekend...

07:25.510 --> 07:26.040
Fuck me up the ass.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.990
What are you doing here,
Holly?

07:43.190 --> 07:45.330
I came to return something. Um...

07:45.530 --> 07:48.130
Well, I...

07:48.330 --> 07:50.220
I sort of took this.

07:50.420 --> 07:51.960
You stole the bulldog?

07:52.160 --> 07:53.500
No, I did not steal it.

07:53.700 --> 07:54.970
I borrowed it
to carry with me for the day,

07:55.170 --> 07:57.510
and I planned to bring it back,
and you called my mother

07:57.710 --> 08:00.380
and threw me out of the house
before I could.

08:00.580 --> 08:01.280
So I'm returning it now.

08:02.350 --> 08:04.080
Thanks.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.020
He makes me feel safe somehow.

08:08.150 --> 08:08.280
The bulldog?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.360
Yeah.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.490
I had it
right near my pillow.

08:18.690 --> 08:21.930
It was the best sleep
that I maybe ever had, like,...

08:22.130 --> 08:25.700
like, it was watching
out for me somehow.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.270
What?

08:30.470 --> 08:33.460
We all so happily believe
that God is watching over us,

08:33.659 --> 08:36.650
yet the idea that the almighty
might be so almighty

08:36.850 --> 08:38.480
that it could inhabit
an inanimate object?

08:38.679 --> 08:42.320
That's just beyond the scope
of our imagination?

08:42.520 --> 08:45.990
That's bullshit.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.420
Or, I mean, if you prefer
the Irish translation,

08:48.620 --> 08:51.190
it's "fooked."

08:54.460 --> 08:57.730
You can keep the bulldog.

08:57.930 --> 08:58.870
I could never.

09:00.170 --> 09:01.870
My daughter doesn't have
much use for it.

09:03.770 --> 09:07.810
She bought it
because it had meaning for her.

09:08.010 --> 09:09.310
And it...
It will again for her, I know.

09:09.510 --> 09:14.250
Well, in the meanwhile,
let's put it to good use.

09:14.450 --> 09:14.820
You need your sleep.

09:18.690 --> 09:21.360
Thank you.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.160
So, have you had
any recent contact

09:23.360 --> 09:24.160
under Debbie's Blue Umbrella?

09:24.360 --> 09:26.430
No, no, no.
No, he's not responding.

09:27.060 --> 09:31.070
It's, uh, likely he's gone
underground after, you know...

09:31.270 --> 09:34.500
Your car
and my cousin exploded.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.210
After that, yeah.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.910
So, we need to bait him,
you know, lure him out.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.140
What we need
is for you to go home.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.180
Does your mother know
you're here?

09:44.380 --> 09:46.120
'Cause if she does,
I am soon gonna be arrested.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.720
No, I told her
I was going to the library.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.320
Well, I'm calling a cab.
You need to go.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.950
Wait, wait.
Hold on. I...

09:51.150 --> 09:52.590
No, no,
I'm not holding on.

09:52.790 --> 09:53.620
You need to go.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.220
I went over
to Olivia's apartment,

09:55.420 --> 09:56.530
and I found this.

09:56.730 --> 10:00.030
This is who serviced
her computer.

10:08.370 --> 10:12.410
Any available associate
to the front desk, please.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.740
What the fuck
are you doing?

10:15.940 --> 10:16.750
I'm organizing.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.250
Uh, no, I need you
out on the floor.

10:18.450 --> 10:19.750
You're back here moving shit? Jesus.

10:19.950 --> 10:20.680
First
you come in late.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.550
I wasn't late.
Yes, you were.

10:22.750 --> 10:23.620
You should be glad
I'm here at all.

10:23.820 --> 10:24.650
I'm still feeling sick.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.370
Oh, bullshit.
You're not sick,

10:26.570 --> 10:27.870
other than maybe some psycho way.

10:28.070 --> 10:29.360
You're recalcitrant's
what you are.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.090
What the hell is this?

10:32.130 --> 10:34.800
That's the Sony HT
Surround Sound Theater System.

10:35.000 --> 10:35.970
I didn't even know
we had that in stock.

10:36.170 --> 10:38.600
We don't.
It's a special order.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.040
Customer never showed, we have
to send it to collections.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.470
What are you doing
with them?

10:44.670 --> 10:45.770
Just organizing them.

10:45.970 --> 10:47.910
Organizing.

10:48.110 --> 10:49.340
Are you up to something?

10:49.540 --> 10:50.780
You're stealing them.

10:51.780 --> 10:53.280
What?

10:53.480 --> 10:56.050
What are you doing
with the speakers?

10:56.250 --> 10:57.620
I spoke to Josh about using them,

10:57.820 --> 11:00.390
setting up a viewing station
so kids can watch shit

11:00.590 --> 11:01.820
while their parents shop.

11:02.020 --> 11:04.790
You get the kids,
you get the parents.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.930
Same as selling ice cream.

11:09.030 --> 11:12.400
So you're end-running me to Josh?

11:12.600 --> 11:13.200
You and he best buds now?

11:15.070 --> 11:16.270
Robi?
What's the problem,

11:16.470 --> 11:18.570
Problem?
Seems to be you, Brady.

11:18.770 --> 11:20.590
In case
it's somehow lost on you,

11:20.790 --> 11:22.410
I am under
a lot of stress here.

11:22.610 --> 11:23.850
We already had to back out
of the gala

11:24.050 --> 11:25.550
'cause we couldn't
pull it together fast enough.

11:25.750 --> 11:26.620
That's a reflection on me.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.050
Now, corporate's talking about
superstores.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.490
I need my team stepping up,
not checking out,

11:31.690 --> 11:32.690
do you hear me?

11:34.360 --> 11:37.360
Do you fucking hear me?!

11:37.560 --> 11:39.630
I hear you.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.770
Three out calls.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.770
And I expect you back
within the hour,

11:45.970 --> 11:47.770
or so help me God,
you will be replaced.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.300
<i>Well I'm a human fly</i>

12:19.500 --> 12:21.340
<i>I-I said F-L-Y</i>

12:21.540 --> 12:23.440
<i>I say "buzz buzz buzz"</i>

12:23.640 --> 12:25.410
<i>And it's just becuz</i>

12:25.610 --> 12:27.440
<i>I'm a human fly</i>

12:27.640 --> 12:29.410
<i>And I don't know why</i>

12:29.610 --> 12:33.520
<i>I got 96 tears
and 96 eyes</i>

12:33.720 --> 12:34.280
<i>I got a...</i>

12:50.370 --> 12:52.700
Hold on, cowboy.

12:52.900 --> 12:53.440
Our rodeo.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.210
I'm just going in to browse.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.710
Right.
Can I see it?

12:58.910 --> 13:00.180
Business card?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.180
Oh, uh...

13:02.380 --> 13:04.280
I suppose you want to see it,
as well, keep current.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.380
Fuck off.
Easy.

13:05.580 --> 13:06.780
I'm going in with you.

13:06.980 --> 13:07.950
No, Bill.

13:08.150 --> 13:10.550
As you said yourself, you need
all the help you can get,

13:10.750 --> 13:14.520
and I know this case better.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.990
Don't overstep.

13:16.190 --> 13:17.460
I never overstep.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.230
Don't let them walk away, Emily.
Don't let them walk away.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.370
That's why you can
never make a sale.

13:25.570 --> 13:26.570
No, you keep them here.

13:26.770 --> 13:27.570
Trip them if you have to.

13:27.770 --> 13:28.800
I mean,
don't actually trip them.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.510
We don't want a lawsuit,
but just don't let 'em leave.

13:30.710 --> 13:31.470
Uh, good morning,

13:31.670 --> 13:32.410
welcome to Supreme Electronix.

13:32.610 --> 13:33.740
How can I help you?

13:33.940 --> 13:34.880
I'm Detective Dixon.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.150
This is Detective Torres.

13:36.350 --> 13:37.810
Retired Detective Bill Hodges.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.880
Uh, wow.
Okay.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.390
We have some questions
about an Olivia Trelawney,

13:43.590 --> 13:45.090
who we believe
was a customer of yours.

13:45.290 --> 13:46.960
Olivia Trelawney?
Yeah.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.120
What, you mean
the Mercedes lady?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.960
That's correct.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.260
Uhh, yeah,
she was a customer.

13:53.460 --> 13:56.630
Did she ever take, uh,
service calls in her home?

13:56.830 --> 13:58.170
Quite frequently.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.500
She, uh, had a lot of issues
with her computers.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.100
Well, uh,
she had a lot of issues

14:02.300 --> 14:03.320
with everything, actually.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.340
We're out there all the time.

14:04.540 --> 14:07.710
She's a bit of a nuisance,
truth be told.

14:07.910 --> 14:08.610
Who went out
to the house?

14:08.810 --> 14:10.700
Was it the same technician
every visit?

14:10.900 --> 14:12.580
Yeah, it was always
Brady Hartsfield.

14:12.780 --> 14:15.450
She always requested him.
It's kind of his clientele.

14:15.650 --> 14:16.250
What, older women?

14:16.450 --> 14:18.290
Yes.

14:18.490 --> 14:19.860
Is Mr. Hartsfield here?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.190
Well, you just
missed him, actually.

14:21.390 --> 14:24.130
He went out on a call, but he'll
be back within the hour.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.030
Should be.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.280
Would you mind giving us
his contact info?

14:27.480 --> 14:29.530
You have a driver's license
on file, any ID?

14:29.730 --> 14:32.470
Well, I...

14:32.670 --> 14:34.170
I'm not allowed to give out
that information.

14:34.370 --> 14:35.740
This is an urgent matter.

14:35.940 --> 14:36.870
What did he do?

14:37.070 --> 14:38.410
We just want to ask him
some questions, that's all.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.810
Am I in danger?

14:42.010 --> 14:43.250
Only of being a dick.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.480
Will you give us
the information

14:44.680 --> 14:45.880
that we asked for, please?

14:47.380 --> 14:49.020
I'm sorry.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.450
Why would you think
you might be in danger, sir?

14:51.650 --> 14:52.390
Let's just say
your being here

14:52.590 --> 14:55.290
confirms a few of my, uh, prejudices.

14:58.290 --> 15:01.700
Brady...
beats to a different drum.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.000
How so?

15:03.200 --> 15:06.170
Mm, he's just a little off,
you know?

15:06.370 --> 15:08.300
Lives with his mother off.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.440
Can I ask
what this is about?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.770
Uh, that's fine.
No.

15:12.970 --> 15:15.190
Brady Hartsfield,

15:15.390 --> 15:17.410
192 Elm Street,

15:17.610 --> 15:20.170
Bridgton, Ohio, 43038.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.240
Do you have a picture?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.320
Uh, yeah,
in our system.

15:28.190 --> 15:29.990
There he is.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.660
Jesus.

15:31.860 --> 15:32.800
The ice cream man.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.260
What?

15:34.460 --> 15:35.660
Mr. Friendly.

15:35.860 --> 15:38.530
Drives an ice cream truck
in our neighborhood.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.000
That would be Brady.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.010
He's always leaving work early
to go drive his ice cream truck.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.790
What'd he do?
He didn't do anything, sir.

15:44.990 --> 15:46.380
to ask him some questions.
We just want

15:46.580 --> 15:48.430
That's all. You said
he'd be back in an hour?

15:48.630 --> 15:50.440
Well, I can call him,
get him to come right now.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.450
That's okay, we can wait.
No, it's no trouble.

15:52.650 --> 15:53.550
I'm sure I can get him back
right now.

15:53.750 --> 15:54.680
That's okay, we can wait.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.960
We cannot wait.
We got to search his house now.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.060
On what grounds?

16:01.260 --> 16:03.090
I mean, that he serviced
the lady's computer?

16:03.290 --> 16:05.130
The computer that drove her
to suicide, yeah.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.300
We still can't get a warrant.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.460
Listen, I interviewed a guy
on Elm Street, all right?

16:08.660 --> 16:09.830
His car was broken into
and messed around.

16:10.030 --> 16:12.200
The same creepy crawler M.O.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.900
195 Elm Street.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.970
And it's still not enough.
It's enough for me.

16:16.970 --> 16:18.040
Wait,
where are you going?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.110
I'm saying hi to his mom.

16:19.310 --> 16:20.610
You don't need
a warrant for that.

16:20.810 --> 16:22.080
Just being neighborly.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.380
I'm calling in some backup.
Not necessary.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.580
It is to me.

16:48.100 --> 16:52.070
I made a decision.

16:52.270 --> 16:53.210
I'm gonna make my dent.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.350
A much bigger dent
than the first one.

16:59.480 --> 17:04.050
This will be my masterpiece.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.660
It won't make us rich.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.260
But it will reunite us.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.430
How's that for a plan?

17:21.839 --> 17:25.240
I think that sounds
like a very good plan.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.490
Hello! Anybody here?

18:17.360 --> 18:18.290
Mrs. Hartsfield?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.560
Hello! Anybody?

18:22.760 --> 18:24.200
Let's just
knock the door down.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.300
Exigent circumstances.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.400
We can't do that, sir.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.570
Why the fuck not?

18:27.770 --> 18:29.610
There's possibly a killer in there.

18:29.810 --> 18:31.920
Well, this would not
qualify as hot pursuit,

18:32.120 --> 18:34.240
exempting us from obtaining
a search warrant.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.110
Any evidence gathered therein
together with any evidence

18:48.310 --> 18:50.690
that it might lead to would be
suppressed as poisoned fruits

18:50.890 --> 18:53.060
in a court of law.
and deemed inadmissible

18:53.260 --> 18:56.300
Per the exclusionary rule,
the right of the people...

18:56.500 --> 18:58.430
Right out of the
fuckin' Academy, are you?

18:58.630 --> 19:00.670
Graduated six months ago, sir.

19:00.870 --> 19:02.600
That doesn't change the fact
that you're not getting

19:02.800 --> 19:04.210
in this house
without a warrant.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.890
Hey, what's going on?

19:22.090 --> 19:23.890
Hey, Kenneth.

19:24.090 --> 19:25.760
You're the dude who was
asking about my car

19:25.960 --> 19:27.000
the other day, right?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.870
That's right.

19:30.070 --> 19:32.270
Any idea where I might find
Brady Hartsfield?

19:32.470 --> 19:35.200
He's not here,
he's working, I think.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.140
Kid doesn't lead
a very dimensional life,

19:38.340 --> 19:39.110
according to his mother.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.010
You know
where she might be at?

19:41.210 --> 19:44.380
Uh...Indiana, maybe.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.920
Brady told me that she took
a job there or something

19:47.120 --> 19:48.850
at some hair salon,
but I don't know.

19:51.050 --> 19:52.790
You were talking
to him when?

19:52.990 --> 19:55.320
Yesterday.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.530
Haven't seen him today?

19:56.730 --> 19:59.160
Oh, man,
if his car isn't here,

19:59.360 --> 20:01.800
he's probably at work,
all right?

20:02.000 --> 20:02.060
Yeah, he's not.

20:05.930 --> 20:08.000
Any close friends
that you know of?

20:08.200 --> 20:09.270
Him?
Yeah.

20:11.140 --> 20:13.640
No... No, wait.

20:13.840 --> 20:21.480
His mother told me that he's got
a friend at work, some woman?

20:21.680 --> 20:22.950
Girlfriend?

20:23.150 --> 20:25.820
According to Deb,
this girl isn't into guys,

20:26.020 --> 20:28.060
but, uh,
you never know, right?

20:28.260 --> 20:28.890
Right, right.

20:29.090 --> 20:30.580
Um...

20:30.780 --> 20:32.060
Lou.

20:32.260 --> 20:32.960
Lou something.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.230
I don't know her last name.

20:35.430 --> 20:36.360
Maybe he's with her.

20:37.330 --> 20:38.920
So, what's this about?

20:39.120 --> 20:40.380
I gotta take this.

20:40.580 --> 20:41.840
Thanks, thanks, man.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.570
Bill,

20:43.770 --> 20:46.040
Jerome and I just found
something really important.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.580
What?

20:47.780 --> 20:49.850
Well, I'd... I'd like to discuss
it in person, please.

20:50.050 --> 20:52.110
Those with technological
capabilities could be listening.

20:52.310 --> 20:54.980
Yeah, yeah.

20:55.180 --> 20:57.590
Um, can you come over?
We're at Jerome's.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.860
No, I gotta track someone down.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.860
Yeah, but it's important.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.860
You really need to see this.

21:04.060 --> 21:05.990
On my way.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.940
Officer Ken, what's your status?

21:20.140 --> 21:21.640
We are 10-19.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.280
The suspect did not appear
to be at his residence.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.050
Copy that.

21:26.250 --> 21:29.650
Roseland Hills Community Center, two days.

21:29.850 --> 21:31.090
I'm not following you.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.290
I mean,
look at these flyers.

21:32.490 --> 21:36.320
Career night, job fair,
job fair, job fair.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.790
I mean,
it's his M.O.

21:37.990 --> 21:39.060
It's our guy's thing.

21:39.260 --> 21:41.160
Our guy's thing is running
over people and blowing them up.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.430
Janey wasn't at
a job fair.

21:42.630 --> 21:43.570
Let him finish.

21:43.770 --> 21:48.740
If this guy's trying to reprise
his star turn, job fair.

21:48.940 --> 21:49.600
I mean, it makes perfect sense.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.240
I mean,
you said it yourself, right?

21:51.440 --> 21:52.370
He's itching to get active.

21:52.570 --> 21:53.180
He did get active.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.060
He hit the funeral.
I gotta go.

21:55.260 --> 21:56.750
I get feelings.
Premonitions.

21:56.950 --> 21:59.310
And as soon as Jerome
said jobs fair, I got a feeling.

21:59.510 --> 22:00.180
You want to know why?

22:00.380 --> 22:02.680
Because...

22:02.880 --> 22:04.320
he wasn't just killing people
two years ago,

22:04.520 --> 22:06.590
he was mowing down hope.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.190
All those people
standing in line,

22:09.390 --> 22:10.290
dreaming of a better future?

22:10.490 --> 22:13.180
That's hope, and he bulldozed
them down using a Mercedes,

22:13.380 --> 22:16.060
of all things, the very symbol
of prosperity and success.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.130
So it wasn't just happenstance.

22:18.330 --> 22:20.000
It was a jobs fair.

22:22.570 --> 22:23.940
This is my feeling.

22:25.070 --> 22:27.480
You had a feeling
that God was a paperweight.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.110
I'm not an insane person.

22:29.310 --> 22:33.350
No, I...
I didn't say that, Jesus.

22:33.550 --> 22:36.450
I have not loved
many people.

22:36.650 --> 22:40.620
And I have not been loved
by many people.

22:40.820 --> 22:41.960
Janey?

22:46.190 --> 22:47.430
This might be the
most important thing

22:47.630 --> 22:48.660
that I've ever been
involved with.

22:48.860 --> 22:52.830
The first time that my own life
has had actual meaning.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.340
What I will tell you is that
this is a police thing now.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.970
Both of you,
the police are on it.

22:59.170 --> 23:02.840
You need to get on with your own
lives, your own futures.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.910
In your case, Harvard.

23:06.850 --> 23:08.720
Let the police handle it.
Okay?

23:10.350 --> 23:12.120
What about you?

23:12.320 --> 23:13.790
What do you get on with?

23:28.340 --> 23:29.270
What color do you need?

23:29.470 --> 23:30.610
Green.

23:35.010 --> 23:37.410
You need more red,
it's Ohio.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.480
We're a swing state.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.690
I like this view.

23:43.890 --> 23:44.750
Oh, wait.

23:44.950 --> 23:48.120
You're like an angel
up on that ladder.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.500
Are you thirsty, Jordan?
How are you doing?

23:53.700 --> 23:56.800
Thanks for helping us.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.100
Like, I appreciate it.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.500
What do you need? Blue?
Green.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.570
Green.

24:12.110 --> 24:13.980
Are these supposed to be, like,
sitting in the sun?

24:17.590 --> 24:18.790
Excuse me?

24:18.990 --> 24:19.790
Hi.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.170
Lou Linklather?

24:22.370 --> 24:24.360
Uh, Linklatter.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.990
I lather on the weekend
sometimes, though, it's nice.

24:27.190 --> 24:28.560
Linklatter, mostly, though.

24:28.760 --> 24:32.670
Yeah. Um, Supreme Electronix
told me you'd be here.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.100
You worked there,
I remember.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.070
Oh, yeah.

24:35.270 --> 24:36.470
Uh, I used to.

24:36.670 --> 24:38.310
I got fired.
Oh, no.

24:38.510 --> 24:42.010
Yeah, I mean, that's why
I'm here, helping my lady.

24:42.210 --> 24:44.380
Do you know Brady Hartsfield?

24:44.580 --> 24:46.450
I do, why?

24:46.650 --> 24:48.750
Hey, could I talk to you
for a second?

24:50.750 --> 24:52.090
Yeah.

24:52.290 --> 24:56.090
Uhh... Babe,
I'll be back in one second.

24:56.290 --> 24:57.290
All right.

25:01.660 --> 25:05.570
What can you tell me
about him, uh, Brady?

25:05.770 --> 25:08.770
Uhh, well, for starters, he's maybe

25:08.970 --> 25:11.970
the sweetest person
on planet Earth.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.710
When'd you speak to him
last?

25:13.910 --> 25:15.130
I don't know,
a couple days ago.

25:15.330 --> 25:16.340
Okay.
What'd you talk about?

25:16.540 --> 25:18.750
Oh, you know,
mostly private shit.

25:18.950 --> 25:21.150
Yeah, what sort of private shit?

25:21.350 --> 25:22.020
The private kind.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.050
Yeah, okay, well,
listen to me now.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.050
I'm a retired detective.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.420
And it's possible
Mr. Hartsfield

25:26.620 --> 25:29.120
has been involved
in a homicide, okay?

25:29.320 --> 25:30.460
So if you know where he is,

25:30.660 --> 25:33.030
I would seriously suggest
you tell me right now.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.200
What?

25:35.400 --> 25:37.630
A homicide?

25:37.830 --> 25:39.230
Brady Hartsfield?
That's right.

25:39.430 --> 25:40.270
Do you know where he is?

25:40.940 --> 25:43.170
No.

25:44.140 --> 25:47.260
Look, dude, I don't know
where you're going with this,

25:47.460 --> 25:50.580
but, uh, I can tell you, you got
the wrong ice cream man.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.000
Brady Hartsfield
wouldn't hurt a fly.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.220
Yeah, well,
it's possible he would.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.720
It's also possible his own life
might be in danger.

25:55.920 --> 25:56.890
Oh, my.
How do you figure?

25:57.090 --> 25:59.750
Well, he had a connection
with Olivia Trelawney,

25:59.950 --> 26:01.560
she ended up dead,
right?

26:05.630 --> 26:07.100
Yeah.

26:07.300 --> 26:10.100
What, the Mercedes lady?

26:10.300 --> 26:10.930
That's right.

26:11.130 --> 26:12.680
Yeah, I thought
she committed suicide.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.440
Maybe she did,
but maybe she didn't.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.840
What did you guys talk about
the other day?

26:20.040 --> 26:24.380
His mom, she had...
she got sick,

26:24.580 --> 26:26.250
had angina or something.

26:26.450 --> 26:27.250
Okay.

26:27.450 --> 26:28.920
And, um, I don't know,

26:29.120 --> 26:31.520
he was really
totally freaked out.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.660
I was concerned.

26:33.860 --> 26:35.390
Okay, when you say
totally freaked out.

26:35.590 --> 26:37.130
I don't know,
he just wasn't himself.

26:37.330 --> 26:39.330
Like, really agitated.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.530
Okay,
do you know anything else?

26:43.730 --> 26:46.530
I gotta go.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.870
It's not the guy.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.550
The ice cream man?

27:35.750 --> 27:38.590
Have you ever seen him
near my house?

27:38.790 --> 27:41.320
Well, uh, we've all seen him
driving, of course.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.520
I've never seen him
get out.

27:45.530 --> 27:48.630
You're telling me the ice
cream guy is your suspect?

27:48.830 --> 27:52.800
He's the person that serviced
Olivia Trelawney's computer.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.040
He's been hiding in plain sight
ever since, watching,

27:57.240 --> 27:58.840
right under my fucking nose.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.180
I don't know.
I've... I've said hi to the kid,

28:01.380 --> 28:03.750
I've bought ice cream cones.

28:03.950 --> 28:04.750
He seems like the...

28:04.950 --> 28:06.610
Sweetest person
on planet Earth,

28:06.810 --> 28:08.750
it's too big a coincidence.

28:09.450 --> 28:10.690
If you see him, call me.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.120
Can you promise me that?

28:12.320 --> 28:13.020
You or the police?

28:13.220 --> 28:15.410
Both.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.590
My God.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.630
You think you have
a sense of people.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.770
Right under my fucking nose.

28:35.410 --> 28:38.850
So, can we go in
on exigent circumstances?

28:39.050 --> 28:40.180
We could.
We'd be spoon feeding him

28:40.380 --> 28:42.120
a Fourth Amendment defense
in the process.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.880
We got nothing hard,
just knowledge

28:44.080 --> 28:45.650
that he serviced
the lady's computer.

28:45.850 --> 28:46.990
And also could be dangerous.

28:47.190 --> 28:48.320
If he is the guy,
we want SWAT.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.420
So get them.

28:49.620 --> 28:50.660
First, let's secure the warrant,
then we'll move.

29:42.710 --> 29:45.250
Jesus fucking Christ!

29:45.450 --> 29:47.050
Why are the police
looking for me?

29:47.250 --> 29:48.330
How did you get in here?

29:48.530 --> 29:49.420
Just tell me, please.

29:49.620 --> 29:50.790
You broke into
my apartment?

29:50.990 --> 29:51.990
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:52.190 --> 29:52.990
I asked you a question.

29:53.190 --> 29:56.190
Why are the police looking for me?

29:56.390 --> 29:56.860
You tell me.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.630
Robi.

29:59.830 --> 30:01.730
Are you gonna make me
ask you again?

30:04.430 --> 30:07.500
They wanted to know
about Olivia Trelawney,

30:07.700 --> 30:10.100
whether you serviced
her computer.

30:10.300 --> 30:13.520
And what did you tell them?

30:13.720 --> 30:16.740
The truth, that you did.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.350
As far as whatever else you did
or what they think you did,

30:19.550 --> 30:20.520
I don't know.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.750
All I know is they seemed
very intent on finding you.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.620
What else
did you tell them?

30:26.820 --> 30:30.360
Meaning, did I tell them
you're fucking crazy?

30:30.560 --> 30:32.530
That I think it was you
who tampered with my computer

30:32.730 --> 30:35.200
and got it to explode,
nearly killing me?

30:35.400 --> 30:36.330
I didn't do that.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.070
So you say, but the more
I think... No.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.300
You broke into my apartment,
I'm not so fucking sure.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.510
What's going on here, Brady?

30:46.910 --> 30:49.580
Are you
the Mercedes killer?

30:49.780 --> 30:53.110
Gah! Aah!

30:53.310 --> 30:54.250
Aah.

31:13.740 --> 31:15.800
Is that cabbage?

31:18.610 --> 31:20.580
You know, tortoises
also like dandelions,

31:20.780 --> 31:22.710
nasturtiums, and nettles.

31:22.910 --> 31:24.650
Oh, and prickly pears.

31:24.850 --> 31:27.010
There's a lot of disinformation
out there about their diets.

31:27.210 --> 31:28.080
Holly.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.390
It's safer than you think here.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.510
I counted three unmarked
police cars on your street.

31:35.710 --> 31:38.630
I mean, do you know that your
house is being watched?

31:38.830 --> 31:41.400
Yeah, I did.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.400
Well, they don't seem to mind
my coming and going.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.270
Do they know who I am?

31:46.470 --> 31:47.570
Likely.

31:50.510 --> 31:54.410
Your mother can't still believe
you're in the library.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.510
Movies.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.110
Yeah,
I go to a lot of movies.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.320
So, I take it nothing yet?

32:03.520 --> 32:04.720
He's still out there?

32:05.990 --> 32:07.260
Which is why
you shouldn't be.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.090
You should be home, safe.

32:09.290 --> 32:10.960
What makes you think
my house is safe?

32:11.160 --> 32:12.660
I mean, he probably knows
where I live by now

32:12.860 --> 32:15.460
if he's been watching,
and I don't have police cars

32:15.660 --> 32:17.470
positioned outside.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.010
What do you think
explains him?

32:26.210 --> 32:27.070
A person like that?

32:32.050 --> 32:32.880
Don't you wonder?

32:37.890 --> 32:42.420
Underneath their skin and bones,
some people,

32:42.620 --> 32:44.930
rare people, thank God,

32:45.130 --> 32:47.430
just have black holes.

32:50.230 --> 32:54.340
They're born that way,
but there's no getting at it.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.370
No changing its mind.

32:58.570 --> 33:01.180
The black hole rules
until the host is dead.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.020
Sometimes I hug myself
without knowing

33:14.220 --> 33:15.960
that I'm really doing it.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.530
Lips move and sounds come out,
like I'm talking,

33:18.730 --> 33:21.050
even though I'm not.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.360
It's called stimming.

33:23.560 --> 33:26.370
Some people thump their chest
or rock back and forth.

33:26.570 --> 33:27.340
Other people let out

33:27.540 --> 33:30.670
these little, like, shrieks
for no reason.

33:30.870 --> 33:34.010
But I hug myself
and, like, um, mutter.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.250
Mike Sturdivant.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.200
Who?

33:39.400 --> 33:40.150
Hmm?

33:42.320 --> 33:44.150
You said Mike Sturdivant.

33:44.350 --> 33:45.720
Uh, right.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.290
Who is he?

33:49.490 --> 33:51.930
Mm.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.860
He was a senior
when I was a freshman,

33:54.060 --> 33:55.600
and, um,
he was a football player.

33:55.800 --> 34:01.840
I was... well, I was me,
and, um, he saw me stim one day.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.270
And he could have just let it go.

34:03.470 --> 34:07.310
I mean, I was nobody, but, um,
he pointed at me and laughed

34:07.510 --> 34:09.739
like I was the funniest freak
that ever existed.

34:09.940 --> 34:14.280
He said, um, "Get a load of this
jibber jibber jibber jibbering

34:14.480 --> 34:16.179
about fuck knows what."

34:16.380 --> 34:20.449
And then everybody pointed
and laughed.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.620
I mean, everybody.

34:22.820 --> 34:25.130
One person, like, balled up
a piece of paper and threw it,

34:25.330 --> 34:27.500
and it hit me on the nose.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.730
And from then on, that's all
anyone ever called me.

34:30.929 --> 34:33.469
You know, they'd chase me
through the hallways

34:33.670 --> 34:36.440
and to the cafe screaming,

34:36.639 --> 34:39.210
"Jibber, jibber,
jibber, jibber," and, uh...

34:39.409 --> 34:40.980
I did not like it.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.639
I did not like it one bit,
and I told my mother,

34:42.840 --> 34:47.320
and she said, "Well, you just
have to deal with these things,

34:47.520 --> 34:48.650
that they're a part of life.

34:48.850 --> 34:50.850
and stop being
so dramatic, Holly.

34:51.050 --> 34:55.610
And so, um, I ended up
in an institution.

34:55.810 --> 35:00.160
You know, like, on the ward end of it.

35:00.360 --> 35:03.330
The doctor said that I'd had
a break from reality

35:03.530 --> 35:06.500
because, um, I'd been found
naked in my bathtub,

35:06.700 --> 35:09.090
curled up in one corner,

35:09.290 --> 35:11.470
and I wouldn't get out.

35:11.670 --> 35:12.840
I mean,
I would not get out

35:13.040 --> 35:16.330
if it meant that I had to go
back to Walnut High,

35:16.530 --> 35:20.260
and so my mother sent me
to the institution instead.

35:20.460 --> 35:24.190
And it wasn't the best place
in the world to be put.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.920
But at least nobody
called me Jibber Jibber.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.530
Can I have some beer?

35:46.210 --> 35:48.280
Thank you.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.870
Mike Sturdivant could have
chosen not to bother me,

36:01.070 --> 36:03.760
and his life would have been
exactly the same.

36:03.960 --> 36:07.460
But he did bother me, and my
life wasn't ever the same again,

36:07.660 --> 36:11.570
so I've had a lot of time
to think about cruel people.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.570
And what's your conclusion?

36:21.480 --> 36:23.480
I do not like them.

36:28.650 --> 36:30.080
Pete.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.250
On my way.

36:31.450 --> 36:32.420
We got the warrant.

36:32.620 --> 36:33.700
Oh, can I come?

36:33.900 --> 36:34.930
Absolutely not.

36:35.130 --> 36:35.960
Stay in the house.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.330
Lock the doors,
don't leave.

36:43.260 --> 36:44.730
God, I wish that I could hide away

36:44.930 --> 36:46.200
And find a wall to bang my brains

36:46.400 --> 36:48.900
I'm living in a fantasy,
a nightmare's dream, reality

36:49.100 --> 36:51.610
People ride about all day
in metal boxes made away

36:51.810 --> 36:52.970
I wish that they would drop
the bomb

36:53.170 --> 36:54.990
And kill these people
that don't belong

36:55.190 --> 36:57.340
I hate people
I hate the human race

36:57.540 --> 36:59.480
I hate people
I hate your ugly face

36:59.680 --> 37:02.420
I hate people
I hate your fucking mess

37:02.620 --> 37:05.290
I hate people
They hate me

37:10.520 --> 37:11.730
that I am a jerk
My mother thinks

37:11.930 --> 37:13.140
Because I hate
my bleeding work

37:13.340 --> 37:14.360
Be like your daddy
he's sincere

37:14.560 --> 37:15.830
But don't be true,
or you'll be queer

37:16.030 --> 37:16.900
I'm working at my 9 to 5

37:17.100 --> 37:18.280
With boring jerks
that give me jibe

37:18.480 --> 37:19.760
They're talking of the love they give

37:19.960 --> 37:21.040
They never give,
they never give

37:21.240 --> 37:23.750
I hate people
I hate the human race

37:23.950 --> 37:26.270
I hate people
I hate your ugly face

37:26.470 --> 37:29.280
I hate people
I hate your fucking mess

37:29.480 --> 37:32.180
I hate people
They hate me

37:40.320 --> 37:41.060
Perimeter all clear.

37:54.740 --> 37:55.540
Nobody gone in yet?

37:55.740 --> 37:58.170
Not yet,
he's maybe in there.

37:58.370 --> 37:58.970
What?

37:59.170 --> 38:01.380
We detected
some motion inside.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.030
Nobody's answering the door.

38:04.230 --> 38:06.680
We're not taking
any chances.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.550
Got a spare vest handy?

38:08.750 --> 38:09.280
What?

38:09.480 --> 38:10.990
No, no, forget it.

38:11.190 --> 38:13.320
Letting you get this far could
cost me my freaking job, Bill.

38:13.520 --> 38:15.060
I-I don't really
give a shit.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.960
Do you, really?

39:10.740 --> 39:12.110
How long
do you plan to wait?

39:12.310 --> 39:14.920
Calm your balls.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.020
What sort of movement did you detect?

39:17.220 --> 39:18.150
Mostly shadows.

39:20.050 --> 39:22.060
Gotta be him.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.690
Neighbor said his mother's
in Indiana.

39:23.890 --> 39:24.760
It's gotta be him.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.780
My name is Brady Hartsfield.

39:44.080 --> 39:50.780
If you're watching this,
then you know who I am,

39:50.980 --> 39:54.490
and what I did.

39:54.690 --> 39:58.890
Now I'm gonna tell you why.

39:59.090 --> 40:03.560
The why question is always
the most complicated.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.630
It may be a while
before you really...

40:05.830 --> 40:07.470
get there.

40:08.900 --> 40:13.340
The what question will be
looming a little bit larger

40:13.540 --> 40:15.910
for a few days.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.480
Or should I say...

40:22.380 --> 40:26.220
what the fuck?

40:31.760 --> 40:35.100
Somebody will write a book
about me one day.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.960
Psychologists will profile me.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.430
Perhaps
one of those horrormeisters

40:39.630 --> 40:42.440
will write a novel.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.140
Tonight's chapter
could be called...

40:49.580 --> 40:55.180
"Things that go bang
in the night."

41:17.140 --> 41:18.140
What the fuck?

41:27.850 --> 41:31.790
This is Commander Fuller from
the Canton Police SWAT team.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.550
Step out of the vehicle immediately.

41:35.720 --> 41:39.090
I repeat, step out
of the vehicle immediately,

41:39.290 --> 41:41.600
or deadly force will be used!

41:41.800 --> 41:44.160
Driver, this is
your final warning!

41:46.100 --> 41:47.500
Gas 'em!

41:54.580 --> 41:56.440
I can't get a visual.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.480
Breach and clear.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.580
Hold the channel.

42:03.780 --> 42:05.690
Could be rigged.

42:38.350 --> 42:39.290
Let's take the house!

42:39.490 --> 42:41.020
Let's go!

42:52.030 --> 42:52.230
Breach up.

43:24.130 --> 43:25.930
Gate.
Breach, you're up!

43:26.130 --> 43:28.000
Yes, sir.

43:32.410 --> 43:35.880
Down, down.

44:09.340 --> 44:10.630
Turn it off!

44:10.830 --> 44:12.110
Yes, sir.
Move!

44:17.420 --> 44:19.870
It's encrypted, sir.
Can't turn it off.

44:20.070 --> 44:22.520
Okay, find a fuse box,
shut the power off!

44:22.720 --> 44:23.490
Let's go!

44:23.690 --> 44:24.930
John, you better see this!

44:27.730 --> 44:29.000
Out!

44:29.200 --> 44:30.260
Everybody, out!

44:30.460 --> 44:32.530
Go, go, go!
Get out!

44:32.730 --> 44:33.730
Move! Now!
Out!

44:33.930 --> 44:35.400
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get out!

44:37.000 --> 44:39.770
Anderson, get out!
Clear out!

44:39.970 --> 44:42.280
Go, go, go, go!

44:42.480 --> 44:44.080
Back to the PC!
Back to the PC!

44:54.420 --> 44:55.020
We gotta go.

44:55.220 --> 44:57.390
No.

44:58.290 --> 45:00.330
Motherfucker.

45:00.530 --> 45:02.130
We gotta go now!
Bill!

45:02.330 --> 45:03.900
I gotta see!
Let's go. We gotta go now.

45:04.100 --> 45:04.570
Bill!

45:09.040 --> 45:10.900
Fuck!

45:37.100 --> 45:39.070
Jesus.

45:57.450 --> 45:59.650
Are you sure?

45:59.850 --> 46:01.570
It was him?

46:01.770 --> 46:03.490
You weren't?

46:05.660 --> 46:08.760
Young white male, late 20s,
that's what I saw,

46:08.960 --> 46:10.760
lying on a nasty bed
with an older woman.

46:10.960 --> 46:13.500
Who else could it be?

46:13.700 --> 46:15.500
And there was a clown mask.

46:22.380 --> 46:24.900
We barely got a look.

46:25.100 --> 46:27.410
Why can't go we go in?

46:27.610 --> 46:30.020
They'll go in when they give us
the okay to go in.

46:30.220 --> 46:31.120
What's the rush?

47:05.550 --> 47:08.620
It's over, partner.

47:08.820 --> 47:15.300
We got him.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.500
Maybe.

47:30.340 --> 47:33.710
<i>I got your body and soul</i>

47:33.910 --> 47:37.550
<i>I got your body and soul</i>

47:37.750 --> 47:40.120
<i>I got your body and soul</i>

47:40.320 --> 47:43.860
<i>I'll never let it go</i>

47:45.230 --> 47:48.530
<i>I put the devil in your eye</i>

47:48.730 --> 47:52.470
<i>I put the devil in your eye</i>

47:52.670 --> 47:55.170
<i>I put the devil in your eye</i>

47:55.370 --> 47:57.870
<i>Than say goodbye</i>

48:07.210 --> 48:10.780
<i>I got your body and soul</i>

48:10.980 --> 48:14.450
<i>I got your body and soul</i>

48:14.650 --> 48:17.090
<i>I got your body and soul</i>

48:17.290 --> 48:21.800
<i>I'll never let it go</i>

48:22.000 --> 48:25.130
<i>I put the pinprick in your eye</i>

48:25.330 --> 48:29.100
<i>I put the pinprick in your eye</i>

48:29.300 --> 48:31.770
<i>I put the pinprick in your eye</i>

48:31.970 --> 48:35.110
<i>Than say goodbye</i>

48:40.980 --> 48:47.990
<i>I've never been able to...very far</i>

48:48.190 --> 48:55.860
<i>Breaking my money to plan a new star</i>

48:56.060 --> 49:03.270
<i>Swimming forever, no matter where we are</i>

49:03.470 --> 49:10.810
<i>Blood in the water, it seems to never stop</i>

49:11.305 --> 49:17.791
