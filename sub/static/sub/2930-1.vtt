00:46.040 --> 00:48.746
<i>Seasoned crooks swear you
only remember two days</i>

00:48.800 --> 00:50.982
<i>about your stretch in jail:</i>

00:51.040 --> 00:52.551
<i>The day you get in...</i>

00:55.040 --> 00:56.869
- Oh, boy.
<i>- ...and the day you get out.</i>

01:00.640 --> 01:04.346
<i>But I'll tell you, those guys,
they never been to a Polish prison.</i>

01:04.400 --> 01:06.741
<i>'Cause, buddy, you don't
forget a second of your stay</i>

01:06.800 --> 01:09.221
<i>in the Warsaw penal system.</i>

01:14.440 --> 01:16.622
Oh, boy.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.949
<i>And you never stop thinking about
what you done that got you there,</i>

01:20.000 --> 01:22.341
<i>and what you're going
to do when you get out.</i>

01:22.400 --> 01:25.902
<i>And who you're going to do it to.</i>

01:30.080 --> 01:32.581
<i>I reckon it takes a
betrayal before you realize</i>

01:32.640 --> 01:37.780
<i>the real currency in the world
ain't money... it's trust.</i>

01:40.040 --> 01:43.587
Hey. So, guess I'm topsies, huh?

01:45.880 --> 01:50.190
<i>'Cause if you got no trust...</i>

01:50.240 --> 01:52.820
Oh, boy.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.626
<i>Then what do you got?</i>

02:07.680 --> 02:11.546
<i>Now, there's no such thing
as one last big job,</i>

02:11.600 --> 02:13.748
<i>but Poland was pretty close.</i>

02:15.120 --> 02:19.111
<i>We were doing a smooth switch using
a standard base to our scam.</i>

02:19.200 --> 02:21.189
<i>The first thing you need is a mark.</i>

02:21.280 --> 02:24.224
<i>Stash Bartkowiak was just
like all the others:</i>

02:24.280 --> 02:28.430
<i>rich, corrupt and most
definitely dangerous.</i>

02:28.480 --> 02:31.663
<i>So Stash picks up a stolen Gauguin
ripped from an Oslo gallery</i>

02:31.720 --> 02:33.549
<i>by a couple of smash-and-grabbers.</i>

02:33.600 --> 02:35.429
<i>So, of course, he wants to get
the painting authenticated.</i>

02:35.480 --> 02:41.064
<i>But what he didn't know, was the man
he turned to was Nicky Calhoun.</i>

02:41.120 --> 02:43.826
<i>And Nicky Calhoun
is my half-brother.</i>

02:43.880 --> 02:47.541
<i>A crew needs an idea man
and ours was Nicky.</i>

02:47.640 --> 02:50.630
<i>Paddy McCarthy, he was our Rolodex,</i>

02:50.680 --> 02:52.862
<i>the guy who knows any
guy you need to know.</i>

02:52.920 --> 02:55.751
<i>And Guy De Cornet was our forger.</i>

02:55.800 --> 02:57.948
<i>Best scratcher I've ever known.</i>

02:58.000 --> 03:01.024
<i>Now there was a time,
if you ask anyone in our game,</i>

03:01.080 --> 03:03.990
<i>who the best damn
wheelman around was,</i>

03:04.040 --> 03:07.349
<i>and I'm guaranteeing you, you're going
to hear the name Crunch Calhoun.</i>

03:07.400 --> 03:10.470
<i>And that's got nothing to
do with how fast I drive</i>

03:10.520 --> 03:12.702
<i>and everything to do with trust.</i>

03:12.760 --> 03:15.431
<i>'Cause without that
you've got anarchy.</i>

03:15.480 --> 03:17.150
I like that jacket.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.980
Well, clothes tell you
a lot about the man.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.511
That's why it's a saying.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.310
I don't know, Nicky.
Take Guy there.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.589
The only thing his fancy white
leotard tells me is that

03:25.680 --> 03:27.464
he ain't circumcised.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.106
You misunderstand fashion.
Fatsoes. Look at you.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.910
- Fatsoes?
- Women go crazy for this...

03:31.960 --> 03:33.789
Boys! There it is!

03:36.480 --> 03:38.662
I'll see you at the lab, Crunch.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.306
Don't touch the art, lad.
All alarmed.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.469
Wow! Love the track suits.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.664
Fellas, I'd like you to
meet Professor O'Connor.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.947
Doc, these are the fellas.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.422
As I said, Dr. "O" here,
is real discreet.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.344
Very discreet, gentlemen.

04:24.680 --> 04:29.820
Oh. Paul Gauguin.
"Tahitian Beach," 1893.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.267
Painting is stolen. But is real?

04:32.320 --> 04:35.902
We'll see. Needs a density scan.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.704
What is density scan?

04:37.760 --> 04:40.989
I'm not so sure myself,
but doctor knows best.

04:58.240 --> 05:03.631
OK, great. So a guy walks
into a bar with a monkey.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.907
Oh. What is this?

05:21.960 --> 05:23.949
What?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.341
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.389
- More red. More red.
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.951
Don't do this, Guy, please.
You're killing me.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.023
They're identical.
Just swap the frames!

05:32.080 --> 05:33.705
My work...

05:33.760 --> 05:35.783
Oh fuck, Guy! Come on,
they're identical!

05:35.840 --> 05:38.705
- Just change them!
- My work must be perfect-o!

05:40.800 --> 05:42.311
You've got five minutes.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.942
So I say, "I'm looking for Mario."

05:46.000 --> 05:49.104
And this kid says, "There's
a thousand Marios in Naples."

05:49.200 --> 05:52.065
I say, "Yeah, but this
one's a criminal."

05:52.160 --> 05:57.061
And he goes, "Two thousand!"

05:58.080 --> 05:59.864
Guy. Guy.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.586
Guy! They will fucking
kill Nicky and Paddy

06:02.640 --> 06:05.061
if I don't make it
back there in time!

06:05.120 --> 06:09.623
Guy, you got ten seconds.
That's it. Ten!

06:09.720 --> 06:15.463
Nine, eight, seven,
six, five. Put it in.

06:15.560 --> 06:20.143
- Three, two, one. Now!
<i>- Au revoir.</i>

06:20.200 --> 06:22.701
You fuck!

06:32.840 --> 06:33.987
Bastard!

06:38.360 --> 06:41.509
So naturally I tell the Turkish
prostitute, "I'll take two."

07:11.440 --> 07:15.465
So are any of you guys Ukrainian?

07:15.520 --> 07:17.622
No? OK then.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.144
Ah, fuck!

08:05.120 --> 08:09.987
She's a genuine Gauguin,
boys. Priceless.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.902
I don't believe this.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.711
There's millions of dollars of
paintings and we're doing nothing.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.067
- Leave it, lad.
- This is Poland!

08:23.120 --> 08:25.268
We can do whatever
the fuck we want.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.184
Nicky, boy,
the Gauguin's worth more

08:27.240 --> 08:30.071
than five rooms of paintings in
this place and they're all alarmed.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.144
Are you kidding me?
There's no alarms.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.581
There's alarms.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.630
Boys, let's all split up!

09:05.680 --> 09:10.024
Train to Berlin. Ten AM.
Bright and early like!

09:11.320 --> 09:13.149
Shit!

09:24.720 --> 09:29.860
Go! Here. What are you...
what are you...?! Wrong way!

09:32.640 --> 09:35.186
<i>That crash was a stroke of luck.</i>

09:36.360 --> 09:39.145
<i>And the cops showed up
before Stash could kill him.</i>

09:40.880 --> 09:42.470
Uh...

09:42.560 --> 09:45.823
Did I tell you the
one about the, uh,

09:45.880 --> 09:48.347
three prostitutes and
the bruised melon?

09:51.280 --> 09:53.109
We only want painting back.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.945
One painting, one arrest.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.546
It could be you or someone else.

10:00.680 --> 10:06.469
You have record in Europe,
so that's 20 years sentence.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.265
We make deal, huh?

10:09.320 --> 10:12.947
The painting and a fall guy.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.222
<i>For Nicky, I figure it
was just basic math.</i>

10:18.280 --> 10:20.951
<i>He's facing 20 years and
I got a clean sheet.</i>

10:21.000 --> 10:24.946
<i>I can't blame him for that.
But I can hate him for it.</i>

10:27.640 --> 10:29.469
Oh, boy.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.262
<i>So I went home.</i>

10:50.320 --> 10:53.549
<i>And I couldn't go back to the life.</i>

10:53.600 --> 10:56.101
<i>The trust was gone.</i>

10:56.160 --> 10:58.149
<i>Crew was gone.</i>

10:58.200 --> 11:00.701
<i>And everybody went
their separate ways.</i>

11:02.200 --> 11:05.747
<i>And I met a girl.
Someone I could bank on.</i>

11:05.800 --> 11:07.743
<i>And even if I couldn't,
buddy, I'll tell you,</i>

11:07.800 --> 11:10.790
<i>she wasn't the worst person
I shared a bunk with lately.</i>

11:10.840 --> 11:13.705
<i>But I could bank on Francie.</i>

11:13.760 --> 11:17.785
<i>Francie was a young buck I caught
pinching hubcaps off my truck.</i>

11:17.840 --> 11:20.671
<i>Most folks probably would have called
the cops, but I gave him a job.</i>

11:20.720 --> 11:25.621
<i>'Cause every new and then,
you got to take a leap of faith.</i>

11:25.680 --> 11:29.626
Hey, Crunch. Lace 'em up.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.981
The only way we're gonna get the crowd
tomorrow is if you take a dive today.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.746
Nope, not gonna happen, not again.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.989
It pains me to say it, Crunch, but the
only reason why these folks are here

11:42.040 --> 11:43.949
is in the hope that you
crack your skull open.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.104
You have to crash your bike.
That's what you do.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.309
<i>One hundred eighty-eight
stitches, 26 broken bones.</i>

11:50.360 --> 11:54.101
<i>Twelve totaled bikes. Three comes.</i>

11:54.160 --> 11:56.308
<i>Twice pronounced legally dead.</i>

11:56.400 --> 12:01.984
<i>- I'll give you $700.
- The one, the only, Crunch Calhoun!</i>

12:03.600 --> 12:07.102
Let me say this out loud,
'cause I can't believe my own ears.

12:07.200 --> 12:12.750
You expect me to deliberately take a
dive, risk my life, for 700 bucks?

12:14.280 --> 12:16.621
- Twelve.
- Seven.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.305
- Eleven.
- Six.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.349
- Eight.
- Deal.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.786
Call the ambulance.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.310
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:30.360 --> 12:32.064
let's give old Crunch
a moment of silence

12:32.120 --> 12:36.862
as he prepares to go down, down,
down into the ring of fire!

12:36.920 --> 12:38.660
How'd she do? Tell me
at least a thousand.

12:38.680 --> 12:42.023
No, $800. So just
don't do it, Crunch.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.148
I'll pay you $800 not to spill 'er.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.547
If you got $800,
I'm payin' you too much.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.988
Just don't do it, bud.

12:50.080 --> 12:54.708
I'll be all right, Francie. Besides,
"Fortune favors the bold."

12:54.760 --> 12:56.464
Who said that one?

12:56.520 --> 12:58.861
- Virgil.
- Right.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.063
Excuse me, sir. Would you
consent to a voluntary search?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.661
- Right this way, please.
- Bad luck, chief.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.911
Thank you.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.865
Ground rules, same as last time.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.229
You talk when I tell you to talk
and when I don't, you do not talk.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.348
Don't bark at me. I'm not your dog.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.346
Did I say to talk? Because I don't
recall telling you to talk.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.343
How many more times
must I do your job

14:37.400 --> 14:40.026
before I've paid my
proverbial debt to society?

14:40.080 --> 14:43.946
Warning: You make me look
stupid, I will crush you.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.101
- That looked hot.
- Yes, a little bit.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.910
We're going to start with
"good cop, bad cop".

14:49.960 --> 14:51.505
- I'm not a cop.
- OK.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.583
How about "good cop,
just do what I fuckin' say"?

14:53.640 --> 14:55.265
You're not a cop.

14:55.320 --> 14:59.106
Correction. The "pol" in
Interpol, it stands for police.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.150
- Then where is your pistol?
- I don't need a gun.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.189
I've got something far
more dangerous than that.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.105
Is it a whistle that you blow
to summon the real police

15:07.160 --> 15:11.231
- when a crime is being committed?
- No. It's actually a pen.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.463
And, with it, I can
deny your parole.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.385
So why don't you shut the
hell up and follow my lead?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.188
Where's the fucking
painting, fucko?

15:22.600 --> 15:25.226
Whoa.

15:25.320 --> 15:28.788
My name is Agent Bick. This is
my associate, Samuel Winter.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.585
I know Sam.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.344
Sam, what are you doing
with Dirty Harry, here?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.741
You know how they pair
professional athletes

15:35.800 --> 15:37.470
- with slow kids?
- Yep.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.145
It's kind of like that.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.669
Two weeks ago, this
painting "Model, Rear-View"

15:43.720 --> 15:47.029
by Georges Seurat was stolen by
an art collector in Mexico City

15:47.080 --> 15:48.705
by a woman we had
under surveillance.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.870
Yeah, I've never seen
that woman before...

15:51.920 --> 15:53.306
before yesterday.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.701
Do I look like a
fucking clown to you?

15:55.760 --> 15:59.069
Clowns try to be funny. You're
just unintentionally hysterical.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.188
Shut your giggle hole

16:01.240 --> 16:03.422
and open the damn case.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.741
It's called "Tio Puno Loco".

16:07.800 --> 16:10.426
Which translates
"Uncle Crazy Fist."

16:10.480 --> 16:13.550
Now, if you gentlemen will excuse
me, I've got to water ski...

16:13.600 --> 16:16.909
Sit down! Winter,
this is not "pointerism".

16:16.960 --> 16:19.381
Every painting tells a story.

16:20.520 --> 16:24.306
- All good art tells a story.
- This one tells two.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.391
<i>Say Nicky here is
stopped at Customs.</i>

16:28.440 --> 16:32.590
<i>All they see is this rubbish,</i>

16:32.640 --> 16:35.505
<i>not the masterpiece underneath.</i>

16:35.560 --> 16:39.346
<i>Acetate solution loosens
the top acrylic layer.</i>

16:39.400 --> 16:45.109
<i>Peel it on back and you're left with
the original oil painting underneath.</i>

16:45.160 --> 16:48.070
What the fuck is that?

16:48.120 --> 16:52.862
It's a marvelous picture. I'm delighted
to have it as part of my collection.

16:52.920 --> 16:57.230
Well, boys, have a nice day.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.344
Where's the Seurat?!

17:00.400 --> 17:03.424
Long gone.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.989
- Sunny.
- Yeah. How'd it go?

17:10.040 --> 17:11.550
Ah, it went.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.987
Bad luck, chief.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.829
You got the money?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.340
There you go.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.986
- It feels a little light.
- Well, why don't you open it?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.146
"I'm sorry.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.820
I'm sorry for hitting
you with a lead pipe."

17:31.880 --> 17:33.823
What the fuck...

17:46.120 --> 17:48.302
Crunch, honey, we're out of ice.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.747
Oh yeah, all right.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.741
- Thank you, Crunchie.
- Adios, fellas.

17:55.840 --> 17:59.626
Ice? $50 for ice? It's wintertime.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.709
Crunch, she's, she's not
even trying anymore.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.342
- Happy wife, happy life, right?
- So you say.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.980
Oh, I don't know, Francie.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.747
When I was a young buck
I thought I'd make history,

18:11.800 --> 18:15.109
not just sit there
reading about it.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.191
Hell, I thought I'd be a great man.

18:20.280 --> 18:26.342
OK, so you're not... stereotypically
great, like Alexander the Great.

18:26.400 --> 18:31.347
But you're great like,
great like, like...

18:31.400 --> 18:33.025
You're a great guy!

18:33.080 --> 18:36.468
Great men don't take dives for
a couple of hundred bucks.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.627
And great men don't
miss their fate.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.188
Somewhere along the line I...

18:45.240 --> 18:48.184
I missed mine, Francie.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.184
I was probably staring at it
the whole time and I just...

18:52.800 --> 18:54.584
I missed it.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.424
My God, you're a downer.
A fuckin' boner killer.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.547
And what are you going to do?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.639
Are you gonna sell fuckin'
insurance or something?

19:04.640 --> 19:07.903
Just shut the fuck up
and cheer up, please.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.661
Allow me.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.822
- Yo, Dennis Calhoun?
- Who's asking?

19:17.880 --> 19:20.551
- It's fuckin' Sunny.
- Sounds about right.

19:20.600 --> 19:25.388
Hey, Crunch, there's some guy with
an eye-patch here to see you.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.587
Oh, easy, man!

19:43.640 --> 19:46.027
Where's your fuckin' brother?

19:46.120 --> 19:49.160
I was gonna cut bait and go home then
I realized Nicky said he had a brother.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.980
Oww. Fuck!

19:56.760 --> 20:01.422
Sweet Baby Jesus.
What are you, a pirate?

20:03.080 --> 20:05.479
Hey, hey, hey. Look! I don't
know where Nicky is, all right.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.662
- He said you work with him.
- Yeah, a long time ago.

20:07.720 --> 20:10.346
Now, look, I got like $300
stashed in the bedroom there.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.231
It's yours. A guy in your line of
work might prefer doubloons...

20:13.280 --> 20:14.381
I'm not a fuckin' pirate!

20:17.000 --> 20:18.829
I don't even talk to Nicky.
I hate him.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.426
Here's what's what.
I want the 30 grand

20:21.480 --> 20:23.582
- or I want that fuckin' painting.
- What painting?

20:23.640 --> 20:26.391
- The Seurat.
- Whoa! Whoa! What?

20:26.440 --> 20:27.826
- The Seurat!
- What?

20:27.880 --> 20:30.551
The Georges Seurat,
you ignorant fuck!

20:30.600 --> 20:32.702
The seminal French
"Post-Impressionalist".

20:32.760 --> 20:36.831
The father of pointillism. That
Georges Seurat, you fuckin' baboon.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.627
Now I want the
30 grand, the painting

20:40.680 --> 20:42.908
or a bullet in your fucking head!

20:46.400 --> 20:48.309
Hey, uh...

20:48.360 --> 20:51.191
- Crunch, is everything OK?
- Yeah.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.946
What... what's happening, exactly?

20:54.000 --> 20:57.388
- Nothing.
- What?

20:57.480 --> 20:59.787
I'm being held at
gunpoint by a pirate.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.465
I'm in the bathroom.
What do you think, Francie?

21:01.520 --> 21:04.305
All right. Sorry for
fuckin' askin'!

21:04.360 --> 21:06.986
I ain't leavin'
without the 30 grand.

21:07.040 --> 21:11.828
Sorry, Sinbad, but I don't think
that musketoon's gonna even fire.

21:11.880 --> 21:15.348
So go ahead and pull the trigger
'cause I got no painting,

21:15.400 --> 21:19.186
no Nicky and no 30 fucking grand!

21:23.960 --> 21:25.630
Who owns that fuckin' bike outside?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.185
Wait a minute, man.

21:36.320 --> 21:40.391
- What the fuck?
- What's going on?

21:40.480 --> 21:43.390
- Nicky's back.
- What?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.905
And so am I.

21:44.960 --> 21:48.143
What the fuck just happened?

21:48.240 --> 21:52.311
Fate! Fate is what just happened.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.145
<i>Uncle Paddy.</i>

21:54.200 --> 21:56.587
How are you, lad?
Still in the land of the living?

21:56.640 --> 21:59.505
You wanted to know when I was
ready to go back to work.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.424
Well, I'm ready.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.710
- Citizenship?
- Various.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.186
Anything to declare?

22:09.240 --> 22:12.549
Nothing but my undying
love for you, beautiful.

22:14.880 --> 22:15.981
Pull over.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.664
Hey, Paddy?

22:34.600 --> 22:37.749
- What's that?
- A Seurat.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.586
If this is even close to real,
Paddy's gonna make a bundle.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.425
Oh, it's real.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.948
I was hoping to get Paddy
to move it for me.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.671
- Oh, hi. I'm Nicky...
- I know.

22:55.720 --> 23:00.951
Right. Well, could you be so kind
as to give me and my brother

23:01.000 --> 23:03.467
a moment here to catch up?

23:12.520 --> 23:14.270
So.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.391
How'd you get the scar? Motorbike?

23:20.240 --> 23:21.944
No.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.585
All right, man.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.906
You must be Francie, are ya?

23:37.960 --> 23:40.791
Paddy McCarthy. But for
you, it's Uncle Paddy.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.400
So, is there a donnybrook a-brewin'
in there? How she gettin' on?

23:45.400 --> 23:48.071
I understood the word "Francie".

23:48.120 --> 23:51.030
Fightin', are they? Ha.
So much alike those two.

23:51.080 --> 23:54.866
- They're literally nothing alike.
- Oh, different mothers.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.670
They grew up on different
sides of the country.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.300
Their father was the
Johnny Appleseed of sperm.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.144
That's revolting.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.543
You're gettin' old, Crunch.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.862
You never used to be that easy.

24:06.960 --> 24:10.428
Look, if it's an apology you
need to put this thing to bed...

24:10.480 --> 24:13.504
An apology? You sent
me to prison, man.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.344
Exactly. I owe you one.

24:15.400 --> 24:18.902
No. You owe me five and a half.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.348
But right now, I just
wanna go back to work.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.389
Let's do that, then.
Let's go back to work.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.060
I mean, I practically
apologized here.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.621
You boys done fistin'
in to one another?

24:29.680 --> 24:33.148
Ah, man. I wish you wouldn't
use that turn of phrase.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.830
So, can we get down to work now?

24:34.880 --> 24:37.267
No, Paddy. I'm not gonna help
Nicky fence that painting.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.119
This has nothin' to do
with Nicky's paintin'.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.507
And, by the way, Dennis,
he is your brother

24:41.560 --> 24:42.900
and one day you're gonna
have to forgive him.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.340
Please don't call me Dennis.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.265
And, Nicky Boy, you're gonna pay the
piper for what ya did to Dennis.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.264
- I'll see to it meself.
- I want to pay the piper.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.468
Still not workin'
with Nicky, Paddy.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.191
Oh, just listen to the story
before you say no, lad.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.751
There's a good moral to this story.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.823
How big a moral are we
talking about here?

24:58.880 --> 25:01.904
One and a half million dollars.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.666
Jesus.

25:04.720 --> 25:08.063
<i>Two weeks ago, I gets
a knock on me door.</i>

25:12.960 --> 25:17.270
Julius Friedman.
You've heard the name.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.105
Just stories. I've heard stories.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.667
<i>The things in this man's
collection, I mean,</i>

25:22.720 --> 25:27.109
<i>if it were public knowledge, it'd close
the books on a hundred major art thefts.</i>

25:28.640 --> 25:31.505
<i>Believe me, I've seen it.</i>

25:31.560 --> 25:35.585
So then Friedman asked me if I've
ever heard of the Gutenberg Bible.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.310
<i>Gutenberg invents</i>

25:37.360 --> 25:41.784
<i>the printing press in 1440.
It changes everything.</i>

25:41.840 --> 25:45.023
<i>The first book he printed
was the Gutenberg Bible,</i>

25:45.080 --> 25:47.023
<i>the Mona Lisa of books.</i>

25:47.080 --> 25:49.831
<i>The most valuable
book in the world.</i>

25:49.880 --> 25:51.520
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back that shit up.</i>

25:51.560 --> 25:53.469
We can't steal a Gutenberg Bible.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.191
We're not stealing
the Gutenberg Bible.

25:56.280 --> 26:00.704
The second book Gutenberg printed was
well outside the beliefs of the Church.

26:00.760 --> 26:05.263
<i>The Gospel According to James.
Well, that's a legend.</i>

26:05.320 --> 26:07.221
<i>The church has been trying
to bury this gospel</i>

26:07.240 --> 26:09.627
<i>since before the
time of Constantine.</i>

26:09.680 --> 26:13.341
<i>And, to Friedman, that makes
the Gospel According to Jimmy</i>

26:13.400 --> 26:14.740
<i>even more priceless.</i>

26:14.840 --> 26:17.784
So we nick your fancy book,

26:17.840 --> 26:21.228
hand it on over,
and make scads of loot.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.908
But the thing is,
it's already been stolen.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.511
<i>So last month at the Vanderloos
Gallery in Amsterdam,</i>

26:32.560 --> 26:37.109
<i>our man almost gets nabbed by a cop
who sees him crawlin' out the window.</i>

26:38.840 --> 26:41.511
So how is it I've not
heard that such a fancy,

26:41.560 --> 26:43.469
famous book as yours was nicked?

26:43.520 --> 26:45.429
No one knows it's stolen.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.311
<i>We swapped it out for a fake.</i>

26:48.360 --> 26:53.671
No one's gonna know it's
missing... until Saturday.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.141
Now, here's where we come in.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.906
<i>They flew the book
from Europe to Canada.</i>

26:58.960 --> 27:02.542
<i>Since 9/11 you can't fly
anythin' into America anymore.</i>

27:02.640 --> 27:06.461
<i>It was supposed to go from Montreal
to Detroit, crossin' through here.</i>

27:06.560 --> 27:09.664
<i>But the driver got greedy and
tried to smuggle a brick of hash</i>

27:09.720 --> 27:11.185
<i>along with the Gospel.</i>

27:11.240 --> 27:14.423
So they arrest our man,
put the Gospel in storage

27:14.480 --> 27:17.311
and have an expert
coming in on Saturday.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.502
But any expert's gonna
look at that Gospel

27:19.560 --> 27:22.027
and know it's the
Guttenberg original.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.467
Which means the Gospel
According to James

27:24.520 --> 27:27.863
<i>is gonna be put under so
many locks and so many keys</i>

27:27.920 --> 27:33.026
<i>that Julius Friedman will never
catch a whiff of it again.</i>

27:35.120 --> 27:37.666
We get the Bible,
we take it to Detroit.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.988
We collect one and a
half million dollars.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.620
And that, laddiekins, is that.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.143
Well, you're shittin' me, right?

27:50.200 --> 27:54.066
First off, I ain't ever heard of
this Gospel According to Jimmy.

27:54.120 --> 27:59.386
And number two, we're not equipped to
rob an international border station.

27:59.440 --> 28:03.909
Look! There's guards.
There's cameras everywhere.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.223
This would take months of planning and
skill sets we just don't possess!

28:07.280 --> 28:10.111
Forget it! We're not
the A-Team here, guys.

28:10.160 --> 28:13.503
I'd peg us at a D-minus
for this kind of thing.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.951
I thought you had something, Paddy.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.547
- I'm out.
- Hey, Crunch...

28:20.600 --> 28:23.021
- Leave him, lad.
- I got him.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.421
Let's go, boy.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.982
Sir, I'm telling you,
it's happening.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.302
<i>- What's happening?</i>
- Paddy's here, Nicky's here

28:31.360 --> 28:34.623
and they all just happened to converge
in the city where Crunch lives?

28:34.680 --> 28:36.703
And Crunch, we know he's
desperate for money.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.350
Sir, this is all about the Seurat.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.350
So I need you to authorize
eyes on every entry point

28:41.400 --> 28:43.389
into the country within
a half a day's travel.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.464
I need a full surveillance kit,
I need manpower and I need a gun.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.748
<i>Look, there's no fuckin' way
you're getting a firearm.</i>

28:48.800 --> 28:49.901
OK. No gun.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.661
Come on! Hold up!

28:53.720 --> 28:55.584
Let's take it down,
you're a little testy.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.788
Yeah, well, jail will
do that to a man.

28:57.880 --> 29:01.268
Let me add that "Polish Prison" isn't
quite as hilarious as it sounds.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.343
Whoa! Pardon me.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.867
I can't believe you're
still doin' that.

29:05.920 --> 29:06.987
- What?
- That.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.869
Eh, keeps me sharp.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.022
Listen...

29:11.080 --> 29:14.866
Bottom line is, I know that
you're hard up for cash.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.421
And let's just say, hypothetically,

29:17.520 --> 29:20.703
I feel bad and I wanna
make it up to you.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.031
So we do this thing with Paddy

29:24.080 --> 29:26.660
and I cut you in for
ten percent on my end.

29:26.720 --> 29:30.108
A sort of "Sorry for fucking
you over" money. Huh?

29:31.080 --> 29:32.670
Oh. Hi, little girl.
What's your name?

29:32.720 --> 29:35.664
- Robin.
- Oh yeah? Very cute.

29:36.920 --> 29:40.263
Everything out of your
mouth is nothin'.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.105
- How could you say that?
- Gee, I don't know.

29:43.160 --> 29:46.389
Maybe 'cause you just knocked over
a nine-year-old little Chinese girl.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.622
There's supposed to
be a code, Nicky!

29:48.720 --> 29:51.391
You never prey upon the
virtuous or the poor.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.429
You never put the
paycheck over your honor.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.429
And you never,
ever betray your family!

29:55.520 --> 29:57.987
Sure, maybe it's all just horseshit

29:58.040 --> 30:00.461
that we feed ourselves so we
can go to sleep at night.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.827
Maybe it's horseshit so
that we can fancy ourselves

30:02.880 --> 30:05.711
a cut above the thugs and
the gangsters of the world.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.703
But I bought into that
horseshit, Nicky!

30:07.760 --> 30:11.148
And you, you just trample
all over that horseshit.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.822
And you just, now you, you got shit
all over your, your boots, you know.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.187
You, you just... you,
you got shitty boots.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.751
Hey, the analogy's breaking down.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.265
Yeah, maybe a little.
You know what I fuckin' mean.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.866
Hey, what's a fella got to
do to make amends with you?

30:22.960 --> 30:26.303
The only thing I trust about you is
you'll be a greedy, snaky motherfucker

30:26.360 --> 30:28.622
- the second you see an angle.
- There is no angle.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.390
There's always an
angle with you, man.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.986
You're always hedging,
you're always working it.

30:33.040 --> 30:36.781
You think this is
about money, Crunch?

30:36.840 --> 30:38.669
Well, I got news for you.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.427
Think again.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.344
Gotta be a cheaper way to do this.

30:51.560 --> 30:55.426
Just because he says he's sorry
doesn't make him a changed man.

30:55.480 --> 30:59.380
Like just 'cause you like being drunk
doesn't make you an alcoholic.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.746
Ah, shit. Lola. Lola.

31:00.800 --> 31:04.507
Babe. Yeah. Hey.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.470
Go. I need to talk to Crunch.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.620
What are you doin' with him?

31:11.640 --> 31:13.708
Nicky told me you were out.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.749
- Yeah.
- I told him you're back in.

31:15.800 --> 31:16.981
Forget it. This thing smells.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.986
Crunch! We need the money.
How are we gonna pay our bills?

31:21.040 --> 31:22.904
Wow! She's good.

31:22.960 --> 31:26.746
Oh. So, so you made her do this?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.868
No. Crunch needs this.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.148
He needs me.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.946
It's a brother thing.
You wouldn't understand.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.831
Oh. Well, what
I understand is that,

31:36.880 --> 31:40.143
that's my guy and he
doesn't need you.

31:40.200 --> 31:45.101
Well, he needs someone to stop
him from taking dives for $800.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.065
Take care.

32:01.560 --> 32:05.267
All right. I'll do it. But
this one we do my way.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.064
What did ya have in mind?

32:07.120 --> 32:10.508
Well, let's just say things
are gonna get a little loud.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.265
<i>That's where the
motorcycle kicks in.</i>

32:16.320 --> 32:21.221
<i>Simultaneously, Francie has broken out
of our giant, ceramic Trojan Horse</i>

32:21.280 --> 32:23.189
<i>with at least three
minutes of oxygen left.</i>

32:23.240 --> 32:25.502
<i>Paddy's taking care of the
guards, after rappelling</i>

32:25.560 --> 32:28.027
<i>through the ceiling and
changing out of his cat suit.</i>

32:28.080 --> 32:30.467
<i>And Nicky's already dealt
with the main gate</i>

32:30.520 --> 32:34.830
<i>using 2.5 pounds of
all-American TNT.</i>

32:34.880 --> 32:37.586
<i>In and out in 4.25 minutes.</i>

32:37.680 --> 32:41.865
This may be the worst idea
in the history of the world.

32:41.920 --> 32:46.469
- We just need a computer guy!
- Crunch, there is no computer guy!

32:46.520 --> 32:49.430
There's no dude who can feed a video
loop to make some security guard

32:49.480 --> 32:51.025
think all is hunky dory,

32:51.080 --> 32:54.821
while burglars in cat suits
rappel from the ceiling.

32:54.880 --> 32:59.463
By the way, I think Uncle Paddy's black
Spandex days are way behind him.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.544
And as for your Trojan Horse thing,

33:02.600 --> 33:05.021
well, I don't even know
where to begin with that.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.262
I actually thought that
was kind of bad-ass.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.071
- Pardon me, you are who?
- He's my apprentice.

33:10.120 --> 33:15.021
- Oh. So you're a wizard now?
- Ah, fuck you, Nicky.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.070
Look, the Reverend's got
somebody on the inside.

33:18.120 --> 33:21.110
And we need to find out
who that is. Uncle Paddy,

33:21.160 --> 33:23.740
I want you to call the
Reverend and get us a name.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.745
Call me Ponch.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.506
I'm Nicky. Paddy. Francie. Crunch.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.187
Those are some shitty aliases.
Y'all sound like chocolate bars.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.344
Where's Twix?

33:52.400 --> 33:56.903
Oh, wait. Crunch Calhoun?

33:56.960 --> 33:59.745
No! Dude.

33:59.800 --> 34:04.462
I once saw you almost jump six
cars in Buffalo. Changed my life.

34:04.560 --> 34:07.231
Listen, the Reverend said that you
could help us out for 10,000.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.710
Tempting, but not a chance. No.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.067
I told the Reverend everything
I know for twice that.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.030
And I got so sick from nerves
I didn't eat, shit or sleep for a week.

34:14.080 --> 34:17.706
- I'm not your guy.
- If you were our guy.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.222
If I were your guy,
I'd go about forgetting it.

34:21.280 --> 34:25.101
There's 12 cameras, 12 of them.
That's one dozen cameras.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.627
- Any in the storage room?
- No, but everywhere else.

34:27.679 --> 34:31.306
Three guards, backup generator.
It's impossible.

34:31.360 --> 34:35.181
- I don't accept that.
- Well, accept it, Snickers.

34:35.239 --> 34:40.471
- There's always a way.
- All right, look.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.384
I'll tell you what I told
the Reverend, OK?

34:42.440 --> 34:44.940
That we called an expert.
She comes in Saturday at 10.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.989
Don't call me again.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.746
You said, "She". Who's the "she"?

34:49.800 --> 34:52.221
- Who?
- The expert.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.587
Olga Something-Long.

34:54.639 --> 34:57.584
Olga Something-Long?

34:57.640 --> 35:01.984
Olga Panofsky-Cienfuegos?

35:02.040 --> 35:03.824
Something like that.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.460
Later, Crunch.

35:10.320 --> 35:13.503
Wait, why... Who's, who's
Olga Something-Long?

35:13.560 --> 35:17.107
- A badly burnt bridge.
- Oh, she was intoxicating.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.184
Thanks to Uncle Fucks-A-Lot,
there's no way we can get near her.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.359
Wait. Why not?

35:21.360 --> 35:23.383
Old Sloppy Balls McCarthy here

35:23.440 --> 35:25.239
slept with her and then
slept with her sister.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.388
She was intoxicating too.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.987
It's too bad. Olga would've
helped out for a little cash.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.383
- She wasn't exactly a nun.
- No, she certainly was not.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.264
There's gotta be like,
what, ten experts

35:36.360 --> 35:38.667
in the whole country
they could've called.

35:38.720 --> 35:42.984
Paddy probably balled half of them.
Let it go. There's always another way.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.701
Can we please stop talking
about old people fucking?

35:51.200 --> 35:54.668
OK. I got the plan.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.903
No. You've got "a plan."

35:57.960 --> 35:59.949
This ain't a dictatorship, Nicky.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.670
We need a forger.
Let's call Dirty Ernie.

36:01.760 --> 36:06.263
Dirty Ernie? No, if we
need a forger we call Guy.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.990
What time is it in France?

36:14.400 --> 36:16.741
- Hello?
<i>- Yeah, Guy, it's Nicky.</i>

36:18.720 --> 36:20.390
I do not know you, Nicky.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.304
The son-of-a-bitch hung up on me.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.030
Here. Come on.

36:26.760 --> 36:29.625
- Hello?
- Hey, Guy.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.943
Hey, Crunch!

36:33.040 --> 36:35.746
Wow, no. Sorry. I just used up
the totality of my French there.

36:35.800 --> 36:39.905
It's OK. When you speak French,
it's like a donkey cock right in my ear.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.860
I'm on Paddy's phone so I'm gonna
keep it short. How ya fixed for work?

36:43.920 --> 36:46.546
You are working? With Paddy?

36:46.640 --> 36:49.107
- Yeah.
- With Nicky?

36:49.160 --> 36:51.149
Listen, I'll explain it all
to you if you come over here.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.986
- To America? <i>Absolument.
- Not exactly America. Canada.</i>

36:55.040 --> 36:56.790
Hm. America Light.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.629
OK, you want to throw things?
Throw things, OK!

37:08.680 --> 37:10.703
I don't give a shit! Motherfuck!

37:10.760 --> 37:13.386
OK. OK. No, be careful with that.
No, don't do that, OK?

37:13.440 --> 37:15.747
I want to see the piece of paper
that says you can go through that!

37:15.800 --> 37:17.425
No, don't touch it.
That is $2,000...

37:17.480 --> 37:22.063
He's clean. First Nicky,
then Paddy, now Guy.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.427
- I'm telling you, something's up.
- This is bullshit!

37:24.480 --> 37:27.390
- And you know it and you know it!
- I thought we had a 10-32.

37:27.440 --> 37:32.546
Ten thirty-two? You trying
to impress me with numbers?

37:32.640 --> 37:37.348
I'll give you an
impressive number: 52.

37:37.440 --> 37:40.464
That's the number of
millions they said I stole.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.066
I got a number for you: one,

37:43.120 --> 37:45.302
as in you help me land
this one and you're out.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.861
- On the lives of my kids.
- I've seen your kids.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.341
- You'd be better off without them.
- You're a cunt.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.911
You wouldn't know a vagina

37:51.960 --> 37:54.506
if it was four foot tall and
staring you in the face.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.140
I'm gonna punch you
in the fucking...

38:00.000 --> 38:02.751
- Aw, shit. Interpol.
- Interpol?!

38:02.840 --> 38:04.510
No, no, no. Don't look.

38:06.920 --> 38:09.785
- There's no way that's a coincidence.
- That can't be a coincidence.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.624
What do we do? What's the play?

38:11.720 --> 38:13.470
- I'll talk to him.
- No.

38:13.560 --> 38:14.786
He'll talk to me.
He won't talk to you.

38:14.840 --> 38:18.183
- I said no!
- Interpol's a real thing?

38:18.240 --> 38:21.389
I'm not going to cut
my fuckin' leg off.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.230
- Five minutes.
- Get outta here, Francie.

38:23.320 --> 38:24.910
- Crunch... Yeah, OK.
- Now.

38:30.240 --> 38:33.105
- Crunch.
- Sam?

38:34.920 --> 38:38.422
Men of our vintage
should be retired.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.982
You know, when I heard you were
working for the other side,

38:43.040 --> 38:46.349
I just couldn't believe it.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.265
At least tell me they don't
make you wear a wire.

38:49.320 --> 38:52.264
No. They don't make me wear a wire.

38:52.320 --> 38:56.744
And I get to see some fine art.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.985
So... what do you think they're
talking about down there?

39:02.560 --> 39:04.071
Still about the art, huh?

39:05.040 --> 39:06.983
My mother got me into it.

39:07.040 --> 39:11.862
We were always hard up,
but she did her best.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.421
Worked as a barmaid between kids.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.384
When I was ten or 11,

39:18.440 --> 39:22.306
she took me to the
V and A in London.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.220
And I saw an object
that blew my mind.

39:27.880 --> 39:33.111
It was a drinking cup fashioned
from a single piece of jade.

39:33.160 --> 39:38.061
It was just a cup,
but it was perfect.

39:38.120 --> 39:41.667
And it made me look at
everything differently.

39:41.720 --> 39:46.906
Turner, Monet, Vermeer,
those guys kept my eyes open.

39:46.960 --> 39:52.271
It was a feeling I had,
a completeness when art touched me.

39:54.560 --> 39:59.461
I only started getting into trouble
when I wanted to possess it.

40:01.040 --> 40:05.225
And you... what makes you do it?

40:05.280 --> 40:06.506
Money.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.630
Well, at least you're honest.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.465
It's always nice to know...

40:13.560 --> 40:15.981
who you can trust.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.461
I'm gonna find this painting.

40:18.560 --> 40:22.870
Not because I want to get you
or your brother in trouble.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.024
I just want to hold it.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.426
Let me ask you a question.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.548
You ever seen the
inside of Sing-Sing?

40:34.600 --> 40:37.306
- I haven't.
- 'Cause I know a lot of guys

40:37.360 --> 40:40.191
who would like to fuck
you inside there.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.148
Are you hitting on me?

40:46.440 --> 40:47.951
I will...

40:48.000 --> 40:49.386
Fuck!

40:49.440 --> 40:52.191
It's been a breath of fresh air.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.229
Looking good, Sam.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.782
Interpol? Fucking Interpol?!

41:01.840 --> 41:05.069
I'm not going to fuckin' prison!
I'm not cut out for that shit!

41:05.120 --> 41:06.949
You see these fuckin' arms, man?

41:07.000 --> 41:10.388
These wet noodles will prevent
very few prison rapes.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.542
Francie, I promise you
on my mother's eyes,

41:12.600 --> 41:15.021
- you're gonna be fine.
- You don't know that.

41:15.080 --> 41:19.469
You gotta trust me. Look,
ever since I've been back,

41:19.520 --> 41:23.227
you've been there for
me like nobody else.

41:23.280 --> 41:28.546
Now... I might have to
toss in the "f" word here

41:28.600 --> 41:32.386
to make this a bit easier but...
I fuckin' love you, man.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.747
OK, my turn.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.580
That has to be Guy.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.946
All right, Guy just landed
and we got a little problem.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.309
- Interpol.
- All right. Well, we'll adapt.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.303
OK?

41:51.880 --> 41:53.106
So?

41:54.600 --> 41:57.783
I'm curious to know what
kind of game you're running?

41:57.840 --> 42:00.830
I was curious about your game.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.587
We need to get on the same page.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.868
What do we do first?

42:06.960 --> 42:08.300
First, we're gonna need a fake.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.066
- How good must it look?
- Good enough to fool the eye.

42:12.240 --> 42:15.583
<i>Identical on the outside,
inside doesn't matter.</i>

42:15.640 --> 42:18.220
You've got four days.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.589
Crunch, I'm sorry for making
fun of your Trojan Horse idea

42:21.680 --> 42:22.799
because it actually plays.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.710
We're gonna hide that fake in
a Trojan Horse of our own.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.079
Something that draws attention.

42:27.080 --> 42:29.069
Paddy, see what you
can come up with.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.951
I got the perfect thing in mind.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.750
I don't know, what do you think?

42:33.800 --> 42:36.983
It makes me feel...

42:37.040 --> 42:40.349
safe and scared.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.384
Mostly scared.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.942
It's weird. It's
like it follows you.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.831
First, you caress.

42:50.920 --> 42:54.263
Too rough, she cracks.

42:54.320 --> 42:57.264
Too soft, she will not
succumb to the touch.

42:57.320 --> 43:03.143
Just right. It's you. Ahh.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.868
Then we need to get our
horse into their corral.

43:06.920 --> 43:11.264
But, how? You say this border
station, they inspect everything.

43:11.320 --> 43:14.424
Exactly. Everything going
in, everything going out.

43:14.480 --> 43:17.470
<i>We can't walk in our fake
or walk out our original.</i>

43:17.520 --> 43:20.942
So we're gonna get them
to take it in for us.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.867
We're going to use our sullied
reputation to our advantage for once.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.582
<i>Crunch sets off the
bells and whistles.</i>

43:32.040 --> 43:35.667
<i>There's a standard 30-day
impound on undocumented art.</i>

43:35.720 --> 43:38.585
<i>And, because it's Crunch,
convicted art thief,</i>

43:38.640 --> 43:41.664
<i>transporting art without
the proper paperwork,</i>

43:41.760 --> 43:44.625
<i>they're gonna call the gallery
where it was purchased right away,</i>

43:44.720 --> 43:46.788
<i>to make sure that it's not stolen.</i>

43:46.840 --> 43:49.261
<i>But it ain't goin' anywhere
until Crunch shows up</i>

43:49.320 --> 43:51.900
<i>with the proof of
ownership, which we've got.</i>

43:51.960 --> 43:54.222
<i>And we know where it's being kept.</i>

43:54.280 --> 43:56.303
The toad is in the hole.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.945
<i>What the fuck are
you talking about?</i>

43:58.000 --> 44:01.422
The fuckin' huge vagina is
in the border station now.

44:01.480 --> 44:05.107
<i>Because of Crunch's record,
Interpol will be brought in.</i>

44:05.200 --> 44:08.782
<i>But, since no crime has been
committed, they can't touch us.</i>

44:08.840 --> 44:11.102
What the hell am I looking at?

44:11.160 --> 44:14.389
It's four foot high and
staring you in the face.

44:14.440 --> 44:16.861
And on the day,
what about Interpol?

44:16.960 --> 44:19.427
They're going to be watching
us, which we need to fix.

44:19.480 --> 44:21.309
Francie and I will distract them

44:21.360 --> 44:23.827
while the switch goes down
at the border station.

44:23.880 --> 44:27.701
But most important thing is we've
gotta deal with Olga Something-Long.

44:27.760 --> 44:31.421
- Paddy?
- Well, that'll be something hard.

44:31.520 --> 44:34.544
Things between Olga and me
are rough as a bear's arse.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.039
She's got to miss that appointment.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.541
But, more importantly,
is we need those forms.

44:38.600 --> 44:41.943
- No paperwork, no access.
- I'll start tomorrow.

44:49.600 --> 44:53.625
- Olga, darlin'.
- Oh, no.

44:53.680 --> 44:56.021
No, no, no, no, you
don't get to do this.

44:57.120 --> 44:59.302
It took me years to forget.

44:59.360 --> 45:02.862
You are dead to me. You are dead!

45:02.920 --> 45:04.670
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

45:04.760 --> 45:06.988
God can forgive me, that's his job.

45:07.040 --> 45:11.031
- You have no control over me.
- We should never be together.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.944
I hate you.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.388
You crushed me heart and
you stained me soul.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.389
Fuck you.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.231
No, darlin'.

45:23.160 --> 45:25.547
Fuck you.

45:34.200 --> 45:35.870
Are we ready to do this?

45:41.240 --> 45:42.580
Let's roll!

45:43.680 --> 45:46.590
Just, uh, try to act natural.

45:46.680 --> 45:49.067
Yeah. I, I don't know
what that means.

45:49.120 --> 45:51.666
What do we have here?

45:53.200 --> 45:57.385
Two perps, one box, red.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.344
I betcha there's something in that.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.909
Here we go. They're on the move.

46:03.960 --> 46:06.745
Thank you. I needed to know that.

46:06.800 --> 46:10.621
Please continue to point out the
obvious to me as it comes up.

46:10.680 --> 46:13.545
- You're starting the car.
- OK. That's enough.

46:13.600 --> 46:17.500
- You're putting the car into gear.
- I so very much want to stab you

46:17.560 --> 46:19.185
in the face and throat.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.468
With your magic pen, no doubt.

46:28.720 --> 46:32.905
Saturday, ten AM. Guy walks
into the border station.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.519
And, man, will you
please wear a suit?

46:34.520 --> 46:36.987
No offense, but you
look like a slutty elf.

46:37.040 --> 46:40.986
What... is "elf"?

46:42.320 --> 46:44.309
<i>The station gets a
call the day before</i>

46:44.400 --> 46:46.343
<i>from a woman they think is Olga.</i>

46:46.400 --> 46:48.628
I cannot make it, but
my colleague, Philippe,

46:48.680 --> 46:50.782
- he should be there.
<i>- Hello.</i>

46:50.840 --> 46:54.501
Oh. I think I chipped a tooth.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.430
<i>Olga gets a call the
day before from a man</i>

47:08.480 --> 47:10.070
<i>she thinks is from the border.</i>

47:10.120 --> 47:13.349
So, while we'll not be
requiring your services,

47:13.400 --> 47:15.980
we will, of course, still pay.

47:31.680 --> 47:34.021
- Yeah, where're we at?
- I got Guy on the other line.

47:34.120 --> 47:36.302
OK, I'm in. How will
I know where it is?

47:36.360 --> 47:40.431
It's pink and three feet tall.
You're a Frenchman, you'll find it.

47:48.120 --> 47:51.224
<i>Like Ponch said, with no
security cameras in the room,</i>

47:51.280 --> 47:54.111
<i>Guy can make the switch.</i>

47:54.160 --> 47:56.262
All right. We got an hour to go.

47:56.320 --> 47:59.981
- Did you get the nylons?
- I did indeed.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.620
- One?
- Well, it says one pair.

48:02.680 --> 48:05.260
- One pair? Like a pair of pants.
- Yeah.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.588
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Condescending,

48:07.640 --> 48:09.230
I don't buy a whole lot
of fuckin' pantyhose.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.990
- Fishnets?
- Yes.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.540
Put these over our heads we'll
look like a couple of waffles.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.782
This is just great.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.146
OK, let's go.

48:56.600 --> 48:59.180
- Yeah?
- Finished.

48:59.240 --> 49:01.707
All right, Crunch, you're up.

49:14.440 --> 49:18.704
No. Something's not right.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.750
- OK, here we go.
- What are you doing?

49:24.800 --> 49:28.950
This is usually how it works. Perps
go on the move, cops get moving.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.024
A little pro tip for you:
"perps", short for perpetrators.

49:32.080 --> 49:36.504
Just trust me for a second.
Don't switch the engine on.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.390
Seriously, what are we doing?
Why do I listen to you?

49:46.640 --> 49:48.549
You're being distracted.

49:48.600 --> 49:51.943
Like at the Quebec airport.

49:56.680 --> 49:59.021
The border. They're at the border.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.470
They stopped following us.

50:22.440 --> 50:25.669
Pick up. Come on, pick up.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.543
Two minutes away. Come on!

50:32.640 --> 50:33.741
Whoo!

50:51.600 --> 50:52.986
I'm clear.

51:03.720 --> 51:07.347
I'm trying to, I'm trying to.
This is what I...

51:07.400 --> 51:11.061
Hey! Hey! Here we go. Here we go.

51:14.360 --> 51:15.746
Whoo!

51:17.480 --> 51:19.662
Atta boy, Crunch!

51:22.240 --> 51:24.911
All right, just like the old days.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.506
Yeah, the old days where
you threw me to the cops?

51:27.600 --> 51:29.907
Or the old days where a
one-eyed pirate steals my bike?

51:29.960 --> 51:33.587
Uh, uh, uh. Now, now, gentlemen.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.663
Let us drink to James.

51:35.720 --> 51:38.710
- To James!
- To James!

51:40.680 --> 51:43.386
And to Nicky Boy. One for the ages.

51:48.880 --> 51:52.029
- Now you take a bow, Guy.
- Moi?

51:52.080 --> 51:55.707
Four days to fake a
500-year-old masterpiece.

51:55.800 --> 51:57.584
Oh, to have your talent, lad.

51:57.640 --> 52:00.710
It was an inspired effort. I admit.

52:00.800 --> 52:02.948
But I am no Yves Chaudron.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.388
Who's that, Yeeves Show-row?

52:06.440 --> 52:07.780
Stay, Crunch. You'll like this.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.231
Nah, I've heard this
tale a time or two.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.269
- I gotta take a piss.
- Come on, Crunch.

52:11.320 --> 52:13.502
Wait. Who's Yves Shmo-boh?

52:13.560 --> 52:15.981
I shall tell you of Yves Chaudron.

52:16.040 --> 52:19.144
For this is a story of inspiration.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.707
He was everything I aspire to be.

52:21.760 --> 52:24.784
A master, a legend.

52:24.840 --> 52:29.025
A man so gifted his work
would make angels cry.

52:29.120 --> 52:34.750
He was the one true talent behind
the greatest art theft in history.

52:34.800 --> 52:38.268
The theft of the Mona Lisa.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.825
<i>The story begins in Paris, 1911.</i>

52:42.880 --> 52:45.142
<i>Not with Chaudron,
but with an Italian,</i>

52:45.200 --> 52:47.382
<i>a poor carpenter named Perugia</i>

52:47.440 --> 52:51.465
<i>who, a few months before the theft,
works a contract at the Louvre.</i>

52:51.560 --> 52:55.221
<i>As with any menial job,
he learns many menial things.</i>

52:55.280 --> 52:57.144
<i>Such as where the
entrances and exits are,</i>

52:57.200 --> 52:59.951
<i>the guards' names,
rotations and the like.</i>

53:00.000 --> 53:03.946
<i>Little did he know that this
otherwise useless information</i>

53:04.000 --> 53:06.387
<i>would prove to be quite important.</i>

53:06.440 --> 53:09.623
<i>For it is when Perugia's
contract ends</i>

53:09.680 --> 53:12.624
<i>that his destiny begins.</i>

53:12.680 --> 53:16.341
<i>Fate taps Perugia on the shoulder.</i>

53:16.400 --> 53:20.664
<i>Eduardo de Valfierno,
a criminal mastermind.</i>

53:20.720 --> 53:25.064
<i>Valfierno asks Perugia
to steal the Mona Lisa</i>

53:25.120 --> 53:29.464
<i>for $30, 000. It's like
a million back then,</i>

53:29.560 --> 53:33.585
<i>an offer a poor carpenter
could never refuse.</i>

53:33.640 --> 53:36.425
<i>The adventure of the theft
is a story in and of itself.</i>

53:36.520 --> 53:39.863
<i>In short, through luck,
cunning, lazy security</i>

53:39.920 --> 53:43.581
<i>and the horrible disadvantage of
being Italian, he actually succeeds.</i>

53:43.640 --> 53:49.031
<i>The carpenter steals the Mona Lisa
and the theft makes world news.</i>

53:53.000 --> 53:55.262
<i>As promised,
he produces the Mona Lisa.</i>

53:55.320 --> 53:59.061
<i>Valfierno produces the money.
But he makes a strange request.</i>

53:59.120 --> 54:01.507
<i>He asks him to hold on to
her just a little longer</i>

54:01.560 --> 54:04.311
<i>so he can arrange for
her transit overseas.</i>

54:04.360 --> 54:07.304
<i>Perugia agrees and waits,</i>

54:07.360 --> 54:10.031
<i>and waits and waits.</i>

54:10.080 --> 54:12.501
His story ends here.

54:12.600 --> 54:15.704
And it is now that I tell
you of Yves Chaudron.

54:15.760 --> 54:17.942
<i>Six months before the theft,</i>

54:18.000 --> 54:21.946
<i>Valfierno commissions Yves Chaudron,
the world's greatest forger,</i>

54:22.000 --> 54:25.263
<i>to reproduce the Mona Lisa
six times and perfect,</i>

54:25.360 --> 54:28.350
<i>an Herculean task only
Chaudron could accomplish.</i>

54:28.400 --> 54:30.389
<i>Valfierno then sails to America</i>

54:30.440 --> 54:32.861
<i>and finds six of the
greediest art collectors</i>

54:32.920 --> 54:35.182
<i>and poses this question to them:</i>

54:35.240 --> 54:38.105
<i>"Should the Mona Lisa
suddenly become available,</i>

54:38.160 --> 54:40.831
<i>would you pay three hundred
thousand dollars for it?"</i>

54:40.920 --> 54:45.264
<i>He asks all six,
and all six say, "Yes."</i>

54:45.320 --> 54:49.345
<i>And that is when Valfierno pays
Perugia to steal the Mona Lisa.</i>

54:49.400 --> 54:51.867
<i>He then ships Chaudron's
perfect fakes</i>

54:51.920 --> 54:55.388
<i>and collects $1.8 million.</i>

54:55.440 --> 54:58.305
<i>A fortune beyond comprehension.</i>

55:01.080 --> 55:05.390
<i>You see, all he needed
was the news of the theft,</i>

55:05.440 --> 55:08.828
<i>not the Mona Lisa.</i>

55:08.880 --> 55:14.828
<i>To him, she herself, is worthless.</i>

55:16.760 --> 55:20.910
And that is the story of the
theft of the Mona Lisa.

55:23.440 --> 55:26.430
I first heard that story
when I was a small boy.

55:26.480 --> 55:31.586
I knew even then I wanted to have the
skills to pull something that great off.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.989
- And that's why I do what I do.
- I do it for the ladies.

55:39.080 --> 55:41.660
Well, here's to tomorrow,

55:41.720 --> 55:44.744
and the Reverend gets his goods
and we get our just rewards.

55:44.800 --> 55:47.983
- Tomorrow!
- Tomorrow!

56:02.280 --> 56:05.065
Ohhh, fuck.

56:05.120 --> 56:08.110
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

56:08.160 --> 56:12.629
I, I taste an ashtray
and battery acid

56:12.720 --> 56:15.471
and, like, stripper perfume.

56:15.520 --> 56:19.784
So, we headed for Detroit? Finish
things up with the Reverend, or what?

56:19.840 --> 56:22.341
Yeah, that's right.
We all just pile into the car

56:22.440 --> 56:25.828
like the Brady Bunch and just
breeze on into the States, right?

56:25.880 --> 56:27.584
They already flagged me
for coming over here.

56:27.640 --> 56:29.390
- Yeah, me too.
- Me too.

56:29.440 --> 56:33.147
They don't like me a lot either, so...
what exactly is your plan?

56:33.240 --> 56:37.425
Well, we need someone with a
clean sheet. Francie, you're up.

56:37.480 --> 56:38.661
Me?!

56:45.880 --> 56:48.586
Really? Why am I wearing this shit?

56:48.640 --> 56:50.230
Because Interpol knows
what you look like.

56:50.280 --> 56:53.543
OK, but don't the Amish
ride horse and carriages?

56:54.800 --> 56:57.346
- Well, you're progressive.
- I can't fucking do this!

56:57.400 --> 57:00.549
Well, you better get your best
Brando on, hoss, 'cause we need you.

57:00.640 --> 57:03.425
Yeah, look, Francie,
it's not <i>The King's Speech.</i>

57:03.520 --> 57:06.385
Come here. You got two lines:

57:06.480 --> 57:09.311
"Going to Detroit."
And "Nothing to declare."

57:09.400 --> 57:11.628
You're gonna be great.

57:11.680 --> 57:14.784
- I'll meet him there.
- Oh. Will you?

57:14.840 --> 57:18.262
Yeah. Hey, look, somebody's
got to be in Detroit

57:18.320 --> 57:21.947
- to close the deal with the Reverend.
- Nicky, I'm goin' with ya.

57:22.040 --> 57:24.063
- We're both hiding in the trunk.
- The trunk?

57:24.120 --> 57:26.507
I'm not hidin' in a trunk.

57:26.560 --> 57:29.425
Well, then no one's
going to Detroit.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.999
'Cause if you're alone when you
get your digits on that money,

57:32.000 --> 57:33.465
we'll never see you again.

57:35.040 --> 57:38.110
All right, man. Fine.

57:38.160 --> 57:40.547
Pop it, Francie.

57:40.640 --> 57:43.425
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

57:43.520 --> 57:45.031
Hopefully, you won't have to know.

57:45.080 --> 57:48.389
Yes, sir. But if you
just give me...

57:48.480 --> 57:51.470
Sir, we are so very
close on this. We just...

57:53.400 --> 57:56.982
No, I realize I'm not supposed to be
in the field, but that's not the...

57:57.040 --> 58:00.349
OK. Yeah.

58:00.400 --> 58:03.390
<i>Are we clear?
Are we clear? Goodbye.</i>

58:06.200 --> 58:10.385
OK. We need to just start
at the beginning here, OK?

58:12.320 --> 58:13.467
Square one...

58:17.160 --> 58:18.671
art.

58:20.160 --> 58:22.467
- They pay you for this?
- Shut up!

58:22.560 --> 58:27.348
Do you often feel that your
life is just passing you by?

58:27.440 --> 58:32.102
I cannot even be in
the same room as you!

58:40.880 --> 58:43.824
OK. OK, Francie.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.388
I got an idea.

58:49.440 --> 58:53.147
I think we can make a lot
more money off that Gospel.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.064
Hold out for more
from the Reverend?

58:55.120 --> 58:57.222
No, we don't even
deliver it to him.

58:57.280 --> 59:00.145
OK. I fail to see how
that makes us rich.

59:00.200 --> 59:04.589
Guy telling that story about
the Mona Lisa got me thinking.

59:04.680 --> 59:06.862
There's a real parallel here.

59:08.480 --> 59:10.947
Great. Parallel. Not interested.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.943
Listen, don't dismiss
the idea out of spite.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.070
- Not interested.
- Hear me out!

59:16.120 --> 59:21.181
Uncle Paddy can come up with
at least ten more buyers.

59:21.280 --> 59:24.463
And we can get Guy to duplicate
a book for each one of them.

59:24.520 --> 59:28.545
We contact the gallery, we let
them know their book is stolen.

59:28.600 --> 59:30.862
The news hits the paper and boom.

59:30.960 --> 59:33.984
Meanwhile we ship off ten
copies to ten buyers.

59:34.040 --> 59:35.660
Each one thinks they
have the original.

59:35.680 --> 59:38.021
Goddamn it if it's not perfect.

59:42.440 --> 59:44.508
You know...

59:44.600 --> 59:48.307
I think we could make
half a mil per book.

59:48.360 --> 59:51.270
No, you know, twice that.

59:54.080 --> 59:56.103
- You know how much that is?
- Ten million.

59:56.160 --> 59:57.944
That's right.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.783
Uh, all right, boys.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.308
We're here so just be quiet, OK?

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.940
- Just be cool!
- Two lines!

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.666
"Going to Detroit!
Nothing to declare!"

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.710
OK, I know! Act normal.
Be normal. Act normal.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.221
Just be a cool guy.
You're a cool guy, Francie.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.623
You're a fuckin' cool guy.
I am not cut out for this.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.062
- Citizenship...
- My name is Francie Tobin!

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.985
Well, that's great, son.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.790
- Where you headed?
- Canada!

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.465
Uh, you're heading in
the wrong direction...

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.147
Arrgghh! Canada's,
that's where I came from.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.462
Where I'm... Detroit
is where I'm heading,

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.102
not, not Canada,
which is where I'm from.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.950
Anything to declare?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.229
No. Not... not even a little bit.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.860
Uh, your beard's falling off.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:58.066
Oh. That's, that's 'cause
I'm, I'm in a play.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.702
- What's the play called?
- Witness, The Musical.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.425
Witness, exclamation mark.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.784
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to declare?

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.704
The play is terrible.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.427
- Anything in the trunk?
- No!

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.348
Are you absolutely positive
you have nothing to declare?

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.311
I'm sorry?

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.542
Do you think I have
smugglers in my trunk?

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.306
- No!
- I have two American thieves

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.828
in the trunk of this car that I'm
crossing your border with right now.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.869
Please! Please, have a look.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.270
See, see all the criminal activity
happening in my trunk right now!

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.309
Open the trunk, sir.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.500
- Open the...
- Open the trunk, just open the trunk.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.861
- So I'll just... Oh!
- Nicky, Nicky, Nicky!

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.784
Yep. Got 'em. Got 'em.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.942
- On the count of three.
- Drugs, son?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.785
- Oh, no. I'm good, buddy.
- No, I mean, are you on...

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.039
Just open the trunk, please.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.824
- Yeah, OK.
- One.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.982
Two. Three.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.622
OK, here we go!

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.384
Alrighty, looks like
you're good to go.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.345
Uhh! I just need to
tell you something.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.789
I liked <i>Predator Two.</i>

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.147
Well, yeah, I didn't
mind Predator Two.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.302
- It's not bad.
- Its OK. Danny Glover.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.349
- You can't go wrong.
- No.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.502
- Break a leg.
- Oh, yeah! Thank you.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.389
- Because I'm an actor.
- Yeah.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.781
Oh, fuck, this sucks!

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.343
- I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.
- Wait your turn.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.271
- Come on!
- I'm never doing this shit again!

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.388
- You motherfucker!
- No, no! Hold on!

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.985
What the fuck is this! Come on!

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.110
- Fuck you!
- Hold on! Hey!

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.591
Fuck the both of you!

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.941
- You fucked up, man.
- I fucked up!

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.380
All right, all right, all right!

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.502
I promise you, I'm not
gonna hit the kid.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.021
- All right.
- You fucker!

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.228
- What did you do that for?
- Fuck you! Oh!

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.190
You had to do it. You
proud of yourself?

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.946
- You motherfucker!
- Please!

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.671
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, man. How's business?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.229
It's fucking slow, man.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.989
All right, what is this place?

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.551
His office is on the third floor.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.987
I think he paid like three
grand for the whole place.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.586
He overpaid.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.741
This is a golden opportunity.
I'm not doing this for me.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.904
You know I'm flush.
I'm doing this for you.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.461
We're dropping this off, we're making
a hell of a decent score here.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.946
And in five minutes
we're going home.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.784
Give me a reason.
Give me one reason.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.547
OK. Where do we find the money
to pay for these fakes?

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.067
It cost Guy ten grand to fake one.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.427
These fakes would have to
stand up to carbon dating

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.025
and expert scrutiny shit.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.700
Ten grand a book, that's a
hundred grand. I can front it.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.941
You got a 100 grand
laying around, Nicky?

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.142
Yes, I do.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.909
You know, I guess this is it.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.789
This could have been big.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.950
We could have made history.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.066
Damn it.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.463
All right, let's go downstairs
and talk about it.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.423
A million per book.
Ten million bucks, guys.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.504
- You interested?
- Of course, I'm fucking interested.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.061
- Wonderful.
- Uncle Paddy?

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.745
Ten buyers, I can find. Maybe more.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.268
No, no, no. Let's stick with ten.
Let's not get greedy here.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.185
- Guy, when can you get started?
- Today. Now.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.230
It will take me maybe
three weeks... No, one month.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.906
- I just need money.
- OK, 100 grand, that's covered.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.028
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.581
Seven hundred,
fifty thousand, minimum.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.390
You just made one for ten thousand.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.301
No. I made the cover for ten grand.
The pages are total shit.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.346
And if you want these to pass the carbon
dating and the professional scrutiny,

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.629
- seven hundred fifty.
- Do we need to carbon date them?

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.021
With our buyers, most certainly.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.303
That's it, man.
Let's go take it back.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.588
All right, look.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.108
I could come up with
about $300,000.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.182
- But...
- What?

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.662
Gonna take me a couple days.
We still need 450.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.340
I can pull together
a hundred thousand.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.184
I can do one hundred.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.186
OK. That's five.
We're still 250 short.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.422
Yeah.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.987
OK, we'll be home at dawn.
Let's figure this out tomorrow.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.551
OK.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.544
- Crunch.
- What?

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.431
- How much money have you got?
- I got nothin'.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.350
If there was ever a reason
to mortgage your home...

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.990
Oh, no, no, no, no, man.
I'm not doing that.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.989
No, not the house.
That's all I got.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.706
If we pull this off,
you can buy ten of 'em.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.501
Look, man, I just...
Look, I don't know, OK?

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.266
Listen, I gotta think about it.
I wanna run it by Lola.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.519
Well, don't take too long.
We don't have time to lose.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.022
Don't talk to me about
lost time, Nicky.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.509
I know what you want.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:00.063
Good. 'Cause you're gonna
need to talk to him.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.826
He will never give
you all that money.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.311
No, but he'll give it to you.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.622
- To me?
- He trusts you.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.466
And we're gonna be wiring
money all over the world.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.861
You're the only one that's
not on any watch list.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.028
- Francie isn't.
- Francie hasn't taken a bath

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.751
in six weeks.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.704
Come on.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.950
Can you convince him?

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.348
It's no good. It's no good.
She's making you, Crunch.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.144
She's probably fucking Nicky.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.985
Hey, easy. Easy, Francie, come on.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.711
We should just walk.
I mean, he's juicing you

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.830
for hundreds of thousands
of dollars, Crunch.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.190
Cowards die many times
before their actual death.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.946
The brave, only but once.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.904
Is that Julius Caesar?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.867
Yes! Look, I know how you
feel about Nicky, believe me.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.629
But this...

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.148
this is the one we're all
gonna be remembered for.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.906
Ah, Jesus Murphy.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.104
Ah, you waste no time.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.069
What can I say? I'm excited.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.268
OK. Great, we're all here.

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:40.390
So, starting tomorrow,
there'll be no contact.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:43.430
During that time period Paddy
will have made the sales,

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:47.062
Guy will have completed the books.
Crunch will be ready to ship them.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.984
And Lola will be
handling the money.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.791
In a month's time,
we'll contact Amsterdam,

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.990
the news will get out, we ship
the books and we get rich.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.142
Ha. The Reverend's
gonna be some pissed.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.701
- I'll take care of the Reverend.
- I'll call you with his number.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.511
All right, Nicky,
I just gotta say this.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.584
If you're gettin' ready to
do me wrong here somehow,

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:10.140
this is your chance. Just don't
take this and all is forgiven, man.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.711
No harm, no foul.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.191
Crunch, I'm sorry
about what happened.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.627
OK, I fucked up.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.942
I wish I could do
it all over again.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.069
But I can't. We gotta move on.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.144
Look, you've always wanted to
do something big, we all have.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.950
This is our chance.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.823
Come on, man, let's do this
together, like brothers.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:46.386
OK, man, I'm in.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.586
All right. Here's to us, huh?

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.504
Right!

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.667
Gettin' our just rewards.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.470
Truly breathtaking, it is.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.107
Oh, bloody hell. Hey, Midge.
How you fixed for quarters?

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.308
- Dirty Ernie.
- Hey, Nicky!

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.629
- Give us a hug!
- I'm not a big hugger, Ernie.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:28.149
Huh. Midge, go take a walk.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.104
I'll see you at the hotel.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.189
Now watch it, Ernie. The hookers
in this town aren't the cleanest.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:41.267
- Hey! That's my wife.
- Oh. Ernie, I'm sorry.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.505
Yeah, it's just, I guess the fashion in
Europe is so much further ahead...

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:50.348
I'm pulling your chain, mate.
That's a hooker.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.310
So, what's the plan?

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.748
OK. You're gonna knock off ten copies
of the Gospel According to James.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.141
- All right.
- Simultaneously,

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.780
Guy De Cornet will be in that
building doing the same.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.103
No. He sickens me, he does.
His work is so ostentatious...

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.224
Oh, forget him. Just
focus on your own work.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.624
- Here's a key to the building.
- All right.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.623
Guy's books will be perfect.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.511
They'll pass carbon dating,
expert analysis, everything.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.029
However, your copies, they won't
need any of that carbon dating crap.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.148
They'll just need
to look convincing.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.702
Oh, that's much, much cheaper.
But tell me this, why?

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.511
Why bother getting all that
proper paper for Guy's books?

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.226
Why... why bother working
that lot at all?

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.111
Because I plan on sending
your ten copies of the book

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.706
to the buyers before
they can send theirs.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.624
This way, you and I
can split it two ways

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.067
instead of me having to cut
it up five ways with them.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.541
I see. Family's family,
but money's money, eh?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.546
Yeah, well, let me tell you
something about family.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.227
Crunch would do the same damn thing
if he had any brains in his head.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.702
Yeah, but then he
delivers his books

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.386
a week after you've
delivered yours,

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.511
they're gonna crucify him,
and that greasy twat, Guy.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.311
But then they're gonna come
after you, my fine chum.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.510
I won't be around.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.071
Yeah?

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.190
Nicky, you still want
the Reverend's number?

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.901
- Text it to me, Paddy.
<i>- Consider it done.</i>

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.382
<i>- Yeah, what?</i>
- Yeah. Hi, Reverend.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.701
It's Nicky Calhoun.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.749
What? Nicky Calhoun?

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.062
What are you doin' callin' me?

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:46.144
Listen, I just wanted to let you
know that we've got your book

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.861
and just wanted to give you a
heads up, there's a slight delay.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.387
- <i>Delay?</i>
- Right. With the delivery time.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.545
- It might take a month or so.
- Look, I don't know what the fuck

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.391
you're talking about.
Don't call me again.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.907
Listen, I'm gonna come see you and
we can discuss it then. How's that?

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.141
Reverend? Reverend?

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.668
<i>Not here. Leave a message.</i>

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.060
<i>Reverend, again,
I apologize about the delay.</i>

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.343
<i>I'm on my way to Detroit so you
and I can have a face-to-face.</i>

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.627
Reverend?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.781
<i>I think he paid, like, three
grand for the whole place.</i>

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.783
<i>Why is it I've not heard
that such as famous book</i>

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.302
<i>as yours was nicked?</i>

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.827
- Paddy, come on.
- Just listen to the story,

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.824
before you say no, lads. There's
a good moral to this story.

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.630
<i>Paddy McCarthy here.</i>

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.424
<i>- Leave me a message...</i>
- Fuck!

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.345
<i>The special Gospel.</i>

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.961
<i>Last month, at the
Vanderloos Gallery...</i>

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.744
- I'd like to report a theft.
<i>- I don't understand.</i>

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.140
<i>We're not the police.</i>

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.268
No, no, no. It's a book
in your collection.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.622
A Gospel printed by
the Gutenberg Press.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.703
Yeah. I think you are mistaken.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.386
No, no, no. It's the Gospel
According to James and it's a fake.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.781
- Check it out.
<i>- I can't do that.</i>

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.181
- Why not?
- We are sculpture museum.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:52.380
We have no books or paintings.
We have only sculpture.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.225
<i>The Reverend's got
somebody on the inside.</i>

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.711
<i>We have an expert
coming in on Saturday.</i>

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.584
<i>Paddy, get us a name.</i>

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.181
<i>We're sorry. The number you
have reached is not in service.</i>

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.820
- Later, Crunch!
<i>- There's gotta be like...</i>

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.982
- Fuck!
- <i>...ten experts in the country</i>

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.551
<i>- they could have called.
- Olga Something-Long.</i>

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.589
- Hello?
<i>- It's Nicky Calhoun.</i>

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.027
Have you... Have you seen Paddy?

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.148
- What?
- Did you fuckin' see Paddy?

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.826
He left a couple of days ago.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.143
<i>What about the Gospel? Did Customs
ask you to look at the Gospel?</i>

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.946
- Gospel?
- The fuckin' Gospel According to James!

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.307
<i>Did they ask you to look at it?</i>

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.186
<i>What?</i>

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.382
And that is the story of the
theft of the Mona Lisa.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.467
<i>You just took five and half of the
best years of my life away, Nicky.</i>

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.264
<i>Nicky Boy,</i>

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.700
you'll pay the piper for
what you did to Dennis.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.021
<i>I'll see to it meself.</i>

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.865
- I'll take care of the Reverend.
- I'll call you with his number.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.307
Yeah?

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.270
Nicky, want the Reverend's number?

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.144
We could have made history.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.504
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.740
Lola, pick up the phone.
Call me! We got a problem!

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.790
So, so what are you telling me?
You don't trust me.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:39.830
It's not like I don't
trust you. Come on.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.711
- Everybody's fuckin' lyin' to me.
- Nobody's lyin'.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.342
It's like, uh, well, I'll tell you
what it's like, it's like Claudius.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.709
For my money, the greatest
Roman Emperor of them all.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:55.230
You know how Claudius survived some
of the most brutal rulers of his time?

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.509
How he outlived all those crazy-assed
homicidal family members?

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.662
- How?
- Played the fool.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.183
Played the fool and
fooled them all.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.707
Even those he loved.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.467
Bick.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.664
Uh, OK.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.945
Hello?

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.630
Four twenty-six?

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.271
OK.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.866
How long have you been
cooking this thing up?

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.506
Well, you remember Lola's
little hot tub party?

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:40.029
And great men don't miss their fate.
I missed mine, Francie.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:44.902
I was probably staring at it the
whole time and I just missed it.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.348
So everyone was in on this
except for my lanky ass.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.390
People are predictable
Francis, you, me.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.224
If we weren't, we'd
just spend all our time

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.906
trying to figure out what crazy
shit everybody else was up to.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.428
<i>All I did was drop off a sculpture.</i>

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.231
<i>And then picked it on up.</i>

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:05.549
I just needed to plant the idea and
let his imagination do the rest.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.306
<i>Saturday, ten AM. Guy walks
into the border station.</i>

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.270
- I got Guy on the other line.
- OK. I'm in.

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:34.466
Yeah.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.745
- You got a warrant?
- I don't need a warrant.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.621
I'm not a cop. But these guys are.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.908
Domenic Calhoun, we've
received information

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.343
giving us probable
cause for a search.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.468
Look who we have here.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.389
Georges Seurat.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:12.784
"Model, Rear-View," 1887.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.180
Pointillist phase.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.108
This is so beautiful.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.342
I love all the little dots.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.707
It's very artistic.

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.702
- You got it?
- I do.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.550
- Where's your filly?
- She'll be here, Paddy.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.910
The lady has $750
grand of our capital.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.868
I don't know,
<i>mon frere</i>, she's maybe...

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.944
How do you say it?
The scheming bitch.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.102
Hey, guys, she's doin'
something, all right?

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.104
Says she's got some kind
of surprise for me.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.422
She's just runnin'
late, that's all.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.941
We should just go. We should leave.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.503
Yeah, Crunch, bud, I love you.
You know I'm with you.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.144
I really think she
just fuckin' split.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.984
Just as likely to see
a police cruiser

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.719
as her car comin'
around the corner, lad.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.544
- Oh, cool.
- What?

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.142
I, I saw you fight at the bar.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.790
Did you?

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.864
Then he said you could
hold onto it as insurance.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.068
Now I'm gonna point
at you really hard.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.840
OK, fine. Then I'm gonna
raise up my arms...

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.989
OK, fine.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.186
So, you mean, you really went
through all this trouble

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:59.184
just to rob Nicky of 300 grand?

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.549
Three hundred thousand?
Try 20 million.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.385
This is where the story
becomes interesting.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.463
Two weeks ago, this
painting was stolen

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.879
from an art collector in Mexico.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.905
Fate, Francie. Fate is
what just happened.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.347
I need you to find
something for me.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.662
Uncle Paddy could come up
with ten buyers easily.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.868
Ten buyers I can find, maybe more.

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.388
You see, all he needed was
the news of the theft.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.231
Paddy McCarthy here. I got a piece
you might be interested in.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.862
- And she's a real beauty.
- Where's the Seurat?

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.784
Georges Seurat, you ignorant fuck!

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.942
<i>The seminal French
"Post-Impressionalist".</i>

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.590
<i>The father of pointillism.</i>

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.061
- That Georges Seurat!
- This is all about the Seurat.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.386
This has nothing to do
with Nicky's painting.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.623
If this is even close to real,
Paddy's gonna make a bundle.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.669
We still need four
hundred and fifty.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.391
I can pull together
a hundred thousand.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.781
I can do one hundred.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.221
This is the one we're all
gonna be remembered for.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.467
Ah.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:04.308
Ten forgeries, seven
already shipped.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.269
That's twenty million.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.185
I really like this heist shit.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:13.061
- Ah, careful! That's the original.
- Wait, you kept the real one?

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.826
The one... Interpol know the
one in Nicky's room is fake?

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.903
Interpol already thinks
they have the real one.

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.949
I just want to hold it.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.387
How would you like
live with it, Sam?

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.904
I think I'd like that very much.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.625
The first time you see it,

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.148
<i>you say it's real,
whether it is or not.</i>

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:39.704
Absolutely, positively,
the real thing.

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.103
Boom! Oh ho! Come on, boys in blue!

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.389
Suit guy! Whoo! Come on!

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.231
- One for the good guys!
- Indeed.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.702
Well, everybody,
it's truly been a pleasure.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.501
- You did it, Dennis.
- One for the ages, eh?

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.344
Either write something
worth reading about,

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.389
or do something worth
writing about.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.350
Don't spend it all in one place.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.543
<i>Seasoned crooks swear there's
only two days you remember</i>

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.546
<i>about your stretch in prison:
the day you get in...</i>

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.031
<i>and the day you get out.</i>

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.622
<i>And you'll only remember your last</i>

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:25.983
<i>so long as you've got
something waiting for you.</i>

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.427
- One wallet. One watch.
<i>- As of the day you're released,</i>

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.668
<i>they can't inspect your mail.</i>

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.587
Oh, and this arrived this
morning. Just cleared.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.108
- Who's it from?
- Doesn't say.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.510
<i>I could never be certain,
but I had faith.</i>

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.981
<i>I had trust.</i>

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.231
<i>And if you've got no trust...</i>

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.869
<i>then what do you got?</i>

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.583
- What painting?
- The Seurat.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.185
Whoa. Whoa. What?

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.150
The Georges Seurat,
you ignorant fuck.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.110
The seminal post French
"Impressionalisht".

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.106
The father of fucking... Fuck!

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.861
The seminal founder of
"Post-Impressionalism".

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.307
- The father of pointillism.
- Seminal French

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:13.225
- Post-Impressionist.
- Seminal French Post-Impressionist.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.189
- And father of pointillism.
- And father of pointillism.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.741
The seminal French
"Post-Impressionalist".

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.342
The founder of fuckin',
fuckin' and the fuck line-ups.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.501
Arr, matey!

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.982
The Georges Seurat,
you ignorant fuck.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.825
The seminal father of
"Post-Impressionalism".

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.187
The founder of fuckin'...

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.910
That guy!

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.301
The Seminal French
"Post-Impressionalist".

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.831
The father of pointillism.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.142
That Georges Seurat,
you fuckin' baboon.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.461
He's the seminal French
"Post-Impressionalist"!

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.143
My God, you're a downer.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.342
What the fuck,
what are you, Eeyore?

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.911
What are you, Morrissey?

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.062
What are you, fuckin' Willy Loman?

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.949
A fuckin' boner killer.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.746
A boner-killer?

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:05.102
Even for you, Francie,
I refuse to be a boner killer.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.869
So, should I get the door?

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.629
I'll get the door.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.108
I'll get it.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.625
Hoo hoo!

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.906
- I'm in a play.
- Yeah?

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.267
- What's it called?
<i>- Amish Cats.</i>

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.144
- What's it called?
<i>- Punch My Pussy.</i>

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.263
<i>Punch My Pussy?</i>

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.343
- Wait. What's it called?
<i>- Cats.</i>

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.070
<i>The... The Cats?</i>

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.423
<i>The Cats. Cats or The Cats.</i>

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.981
- All righty. With the beard?
- Yeah.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:13.110
It's fuckin' slow, man.
