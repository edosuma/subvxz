  ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> basketball was all about</i>
<i> showmanship.</i>

00:03.270 --> 00:05.971
   <i> Flying through the air,</i>
   <i> slamming and jamming</i>
   <i> with style.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:09.508
    <i> And nobody</i>
    <i> did it better than the</i>
    <i> Harlem Globetrotters.</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.643
 <i> And there was no bigger fan</i>
 <i> than my brother Barry.</i>

00:11.645 --> 00:14.613
  <i> He spent hours trying</i>
  <i> to be the next Curly Neal,</i>

00:14.615 --> 00:16.749
  <i> perfecting his</i>
  <i> buzzer-beating hook shot.</i>

00:16.751 --> 00:19.485
               Three, two, one.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.153
                     Still one!

00:21.155 --> 00:23.689
                     One!
                     One!

00:23.691 --> 00:24.456
                One!

00:24.458 --> 00:25.391
          A dunk at the buzzer!

00:25.393 --> 00:29.361
          The Globetrotters
          are crowned champions
          of the universe!

      ADULT ADAM: <i> That year,</i>
     <i> my dad got two tickets</i>

00:31.866 --> 00:34.833
<i> to a 'Trotters game</i>
<i> and Barry was beside himself.</i>

00:34.835 --> 00:37.803
  <i> Even walking pneumonia</i>
  <i> wouldn't stop him.</i>
        All set.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.638
     It's 80 degrees out,
     you moron.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.106
        I got the shivers
        and sweats.

00:41.108 --> 00:42.674
      Just means
      I'm super psyched.

00:42.676 --> 00:43.942
       Not so fast.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.244
 Murray, look at your son.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.246
 Can't you see
 he's pale and clammy?

00:47.248 --> 00:48.080
           I don't like looking
           at him too much.

00:48.082 --> 00:51.216
 Okay, come here, I got to put
 my lips on your forehead
 and take your temperature.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.553
         I'm fine!
         Keep your lips off me!
 Come here, come here.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.288
 (EXCLAIMS)
 Oh, my God!

00:56.290 --> 00:59.525
 You must be 102.3!
 You're with fever!

00:59.527 --> 01:00.526
            I'm not with fever.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.895
             There's no science
             to putting lips
             on a forehead.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.664
 Why do you think
 they call it
 a ther-mom-eter?

01:05.666 --> 01:08.500
 Mom is in the name.
 'Cause we invented it.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.234
     Yeah, none of that's real.

01:09.236 --> 01:13.605
 Enough. Come on,
 let me carry you upstairs
 and tuck you in bed.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.340
             You'll have
             to catch me first.

       (GRUNTS)
       Oh! Body failing.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.544
       What am I gonna do
       with these damn tickets?

01:18.546 --> 01:20.079
 How about taking
 your healthy son?

01:20.081 --> 01:21.847
           Adam?
           To a sporting event?

01:21.849 --> 01:23.415
 Yes.
 Why is that so crazy?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.716
        Oh, good!
        An audience!

01:24.718 --> 01:27.519

 No, I'm Michael Winslow

 You know, the man
 of 10,000 sound effects.

01:36.330 --> 01:40.065
 He's cornered the market
 on mouth-based
 noise comedy...

01:40.067 --> 01:42.067

         you're coming with me.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.408
             We're gonna go see
             some basketball.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.311
 Am I in trouble?
           No, this is gonna be
           good for you.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.345
      Are you kidding me?

01:53.347 --> 01:56.014
 This nerd doesn't know
 a lay-up from a bank shot.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.450
    Go on, ask him!
    Ask him
    what a bank shot is.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.719
      Is it when you make
      tons of bank

02:00.721 --> 02:02.955
        for shooting
        the orange ball
        real good?

02:02.957 --> 02:05.757
             If I could stand,
             I'd punch this
             entire house down!

02:05.759 --> 02:08.526
         Come on, let's put you
         snuggly in bed.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.130
               Schmoo, have fun
               with your dad.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.132
 This is gonna suck.
                 Yep.

           (LAUGHS)

02:13.968 --> 02:16.969
        Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
        Oh! (LAUGHS)

02:16.971 --> 02:19.204
 This does not suck!
 Not at all!

02:19.206 --> 02:23.709
 This is so funny!
 Sports is so funny!
 I finally get the craze!

02:23.711 --> 02:25.410
          Hoo-hoo!
          He gets the craze!

02:25.412 --> 02:27.679

02:43.731 --> 02:45.797
    <i> a very special day</i>
    <i> in the Goldberg house.</i>

      (SCREAMS) Why?

02:47.001 --> 02:50.169
        Perfect! Hold that face
        and do it exactly
        like that tonight

02:50.171 --> 02:52.704
        at your surprise party,
        only be wearing pants.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.473
 No, no, no.
 I told you.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.476
 No surprises,
 no parties, no anything!

02:57.478 --> 03:00.078
       Murray,
       it's your 50th birthday.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.381
            Your nifty-fifties.
            Yeah!

03:02.383 --> 03:03.348
 I don't see
 what's so nifty

03:03.350 --> 03:06.818
 about me throwing out my back
 every time I blow my nose.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.320
        It's a major milestone.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.189
 That's why I'll be sitting
 in that chair

03:10.191 --> 03:12.124
 watching TV
 in my underpants.

03:12.126 --> 03:16.195
   No. That's what you did
   for birthdays 19 through 49.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.263
      This year
      you're celebrating right,

03:18.265 --> 03:20.065
            so give Mama
            what she needs.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.367
                 And...
                 Surprise!

03:22.770 --> 03:24.603
            That was terrible.
            And, again.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.239
             One, two, three,
             surprise!

03:27.341 --> 03:28.707
              Surprise!

03:28.842 --> 03:30.375
                      Surprise!
 I'm not surprised.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.111
        Come on, one more time.
        And... Surprise.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.714
 I'm not digging this.
 This is just not good.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.716
         That negative attitude
         is what made Erica

03:37.718 --> 03:39.184
               decide not to go
               to college.

  What?
            That's the face!

03:40.087 --> 03:43.822
              Now go upstairs
              and practice in
              the mirror, okay?

03:43.824 --> 03:44.823
                    Go, go, go.

03:44.825 --> 03:45.457

        All right, guys.
        The camera's rolling.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.901
 Let's work
 on our tiny passes.

         I'm not sure

        ADAM: Cut!

04:07.181 --> 04:08.680
 Dude.
 You gotta catch the ball.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.983
 But the ladder says
 don't stand on the
 very top step.

04:10.985 --> 04:14.119
     Bro, we're training
     to be the next
     Globetrotters!

04:14.121 --> 04:16.154
 That means
 we follow one rule,

04:16.156 --> 04:17.488
         find the funny.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.124
 (GRUNTS)
           Ow!

04:19.260 --> 04:19.625
             Not funny!

04:19.627 --> 04:23.161
 What are you dorks doing
 on my court/our driveway?

04:23.163 --> 04:26.198
 Basketball is my sport,
 along with all the
 other sports.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.534
 Get your own,
 but you can't,
 'cause they're all mine!

04:29.536 --> 04:30.068
               Not anymore.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.638
             You never told me
             basketball had
             so much flair

04:32.640 --> 04:34.539
              and showmanship
              and broad comedy.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.342
 Being a 'Trotter
 was my dream,
 not yours.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.845
         To be fair, you have
         like a million dreams.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.447
           There's bound to be
           some crossover
           with your brother.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.350
 No way! Adam infects
 everything he touches

04:45.352 --> 04:46.551
 with his geeky
 nerd poison.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.855
 I mean, look how wildly
 uncomfortable he is
 holding that ball.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.824
  Tell you what. How about we
  settle this once and for all?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.059
      Trotters versus Generals.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.261
         You want us to be
         the Generals?

04:56.263 --> 04:58.997
     The pathetic losers
     that the Globetrotters
     always crush?

04:58.999 --> 05:02.934
 Okay, numb nuts,
 just to make it fair,
 we'll play to 11 points.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.069
 I'll spot you the first 10.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.005
        Let the basketball show
        commence.

05:07.007 --> 05:07.306
              Oh, boy.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.574
            Okay, routine one!
            Let's give them
            that razzle dazzle!

05:09.576 --> 05:11.076

     <i> We'd razzle 'em but good.</i>
      ALL: Hut! Hut! Hut...

05:11.078 --> 05:15.180
  <i> Yep, with our best</i>
  <i> Globetrotter moves,</i>
  <i> there was no way we'd lose</i>

05:15.182 --> 05:17.582
    <i> especially</i>
    <i> with a 10-point lead.</i>

05:17.584 --> 05:18.950
                         Go, B.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.953
            Whoo!
             All net, no sweat.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.455
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> Okay, a nine-point lead.</i>

05:23.457 --> 05:24.990
 Um, could you back up
 a scooch?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.492
 We need way more space
 for our antics.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.427
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> Turns out, our antics</i>

05:28.429 --> 05:31.430
<i> were no match for their</i>
<i> actual basketball skills.</i>
 Whoo!

05:31.432 --> 05:34.599
   <i> Within two minutes,</i>
   <i> our 10-point lead</i>
   <i> became a one-point lead.</i>

05:34.601 --> 05:37.002
<i> Even the classic Globetrotters</i>
<i> pants yanking</i>

05:37.004 --> 05:39.604
    <i> was thwarted</i>
    <i> by their stupid belts.</i>

05:39.606 --> 05:40.706
                   Damn it!

05:40.708 --> 05:43.141
 No worries, let's put this
 to bed with routine six.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.644
     Yeah!
  ADULT ADAM: <i> Which was the</i>
<i> unbeatable water bucket trick.</i>

05:45.646 --> 05:48.880
           One drop touches me,
           and you're dead.
 Yes, Mr. Naked, sir.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.283
            Now pour it
            on yourself. Do it.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.921
       Dear Lord!
      My beautiful hair!

05:55.923 --> 05:57.789
             Have some pride,
             Dave Kim.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.691
  This is so demeaning.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.459
   ADULT ADAM: <i> It really was.</i>

06:00.461 --> 06:02.527
<i> Turns out, we were</i>
<i> the Washington Generals.</i>
                Whoo!

06:02.529 --> 06:05.430
        And that is how
        you dominate at sports.

06:05.432 --> 06:08.467
         You guys suck.
         Ain't that right, JTP?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.468
           ALL: JTP!

06:09.470 --> 06:11.470
  ADULT ADAM: <i> While Barry put</i>
 <i> the brakes on my dreams,</i>

06:28.188 --> 06:30.522
      <i> my dad was nestled</i>
      <i> in a coat cocoon</i>

06:30.524 --> 06:31.656
 <i> and MIA from his own party.</i>

06:31.658 --> 06:34.426
   <i> After a frantic search,</i>
   <i> my mom had to improvise.</i>

06:34.428 --> 06:35.727
            (CLEARS THROAT)

06:35.729 --> 06:38.196
               Friends, family,
               co-workers,

06:38.198 --> 06:38.797
       those closest to Murray.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.833
          I'd like to thank you
          so much for being
          here tonight,

06:41.835 --> 06:43.969
       especially cousin Irving
       who pushed back

06:43.971 --> 06:48.006
       his gall bladder surgery
       to fly in from Boca.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.341
                 Ouch.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.443
            And a big thank you
            to Aunt Rose

06:51.445 --> 06:55.147
         who made us her famous
         ice cream cake.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.448
    The likeness is uncanny.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.450
        Murray is so touched.
 Then where the hell is he?

06:58.452 --> 07:01.953
 (PEOPLE MUMBLING)
             Yes, it has been
             a beautiful night.

07:01.955 --> 07:05.791
       (SOFTLY) Erica,
       they're turning on us,
       go get their damn coats.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.261
            Oh, sweet God!
            Dad! Wake up!

07:09.263 --> 07:11.163
       What's that?
       What'd I miss?

07:11.165 --> 07:12.464
 What time is it?

07:12.466 --> 07:13.365
      Before you get mad,

07:13.367 --> 07:16.067
      you should lie down
      under these coats.
      It's amazing.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.937
       Aunt Rose made your face
       out of ice cream!

07:18.939 --> 07:20.439
       Ooh! I'll have
       a slice of me.

07:20.441 --> 07:23.508
          Well, you can't!
          Thanks to your little
          disappearing act,

07:23.510 --> 07:25.977
        the whole thing melted!
        It's ice cream soup.

07:25.979 --> 07:29.347
   I'm a milkshake.
   Well, that's the dream.

07:29.883 --> 07:30.582
       BEVERLY:
       Enjoy your coats!

07:30.584 --> 07:32.951
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> While my dad was</i>
  <i> cutting out on his party,</i>

07:32.953 --> 07:36.288
    <i> I was cutting together</i>
    <i> some b-ball greatness.</i>

07:44.364 --> 07:47.499
 And that, my friends,
 is what we call
 the magic of editing.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.901
               You made it look
               like we totally
               crushed them.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.572
         <i> We... Suck!</i>
         <i> You... Dominate...</i>
         <i> At sports.</i>

07:53.574 --> 07:54.606
        <i> We are losers.</i>

07:54.608 --> 07:56.408
         Whoa, it's seamless!

07:56.410 --> 07:57.409
        Funny, what is that?

07:57.411 --> 07:58.810
        (WHISPERS)
        Dude, super-cool senior

07:58.812 --> 08:00.579
         Ruben Amaro Jr.'s
         talking to us!

08:00.581 --> 08:01.379
 I know, Dave Kim.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.615
          Hey, yo, JC!
          Corbett! Get in here!

08:03.617 --> 08:04.816
          You guys
          gotta see this video.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.385
 Um, it's more intended
 for a private audience.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.454
 What are you doing?
 Win their friendship

08:09.456 --> 08:10.589
 through a mutual love
 of sports.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.658
    <i> I... Smell... Like...</i>
    <i> Ball... Sweat.</i>

08:13.660 --> 08:14.693
           (LAUGHTER)

08:14.695 --> 08:16.294
          That's hilarious.
                     Self-burn.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.830
         Man, this is classic.
         What's your name, bro?

08:18.832 --> 08:19.297
     Adam F. Goldberg.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.033
 Gotta use the middle initial
 'cause there's another
 Adam Goldberg in school,

08:22.035 --> 08:25.570
 and he's very mad
 about the whole
 same-name situation.

08:25.572 --> 08:26.705
            Hey, can we
            get a copy?

08:26.707 --> 08:28.373
                        No.
 Take the original.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.241
       ADAM: I guess
       you can borrow it.

08:29.243 --> 08:33.544
 I just want to make sure
 we keep it between us
 athletic pals. Cool?

08:33.547 --> 08:34.946
          Super cool, bro.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.149
 Barry Goldberg's
 Globetrotting Suck Show?

08:38.150 --> 08:39.618
          In my defense, I only
          gave it to the jocks

08:39.620 --> 08:43.054
       so I would look awesome
       and you would look dumb.
       You get it.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.556
 Well, the jocks gave it
 to the burners

08:44.558 --> 08:47.259
 who gave it to the
 debate team who gave it
 to the bell choir.

08:47.261 --> 08:50.862
 Those weirdos laughed at me.
 The bell choir, dude!

08:50.864 --> 08:53.365
 They hold bells
 and go, bong!

08:53.367 --> 08:54.566
    I'm lower
    than bell people now.

08:54.568 --> 08:57.035
             Honestly, the tape
             was only meant
             to be shared

08:57.037 --> 08:58.837
        with my bros
        on the basketball team.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.673
    Those bros are my bros,
    not yours!

09:01.675 --> 09:05.043
 From this point forward,
 I forbade you from liking
 anything I like.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.612
                Yeah, you can't
                do that.
      Oh, I can!

09:07.614 --> 09:10.081
 Starting now,
 stay away
 from the following

09:10.083 --> 09:13.118
 Barry Goldberg trademark
 hobbies and interests.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.621
 Globetrotters, karate,
 Bo staff, Air Jordans,

09:16.623 --> 09:19.357
 competitive kiting,
 extreme BMXing,

09:19.359 --> 09:20.725
 hot showers, conga lines,

09:20.727 --> 09:23.628
 and diving into an icy river
 with a knife in your mouth.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.498
     I own that move.
     I also claim
     Skittles and soda!

09:26.500 --> 09:29.734
                You can't claim
                an entire genre
                of beverage.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.703
                That's madness!
 And it's mine!

09:31.705 --> 09:34.673
 I also own roller skating,
 eating chili,

09:34.675 --> 09:36.808
 half and full nelsons,

09:36.810 --> 09:38.944
 Chuck Norris, and boobs.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.745
            No! That's too far!

09:40.747 --> 09:42.581
         You can't claim boobs!

09:42.583 --> 09:43.348
          (WHISPERS)
          Everyone likes boobs.

09:43.350 --> 09:47.619
 Have fun sticking
 to your dumb hobbies
 like robots and glasses.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.219
        Glasses aren't a hobby.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.389
 They're a corrective accessory
 to combat my
 wandering eyeball.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.759
 Exactly! You stay
 in your lame nerdy world,

09:54.761 --> 09:57.095
   and I'll stay
   in my awesome one.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.396
          'Sup, scrub?

09:58.398 --> 10:00.899
 Know your place,
 bell people!

10:00.901 --> 10:03.134
           No, your human oils!

10:08.842 --> 10:10.308
       ADULT ADAM:
      <i> It had been a day</i>
      <i> since Barry said</i>

10:10.310 --> 10:13.878
   <i> I couldn't share</i>
   <i> his interests,</i>
   <i> and he was enforcing it.</i>

10:13.880 --> 10:14.679
        Hey, I'm watching that.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.248
<i> The A-Team</i> is mine,
  get your own show!

10:17.985 --> 10:21.453
           Fruit-based
           accomplishments
           belong to Big Tasty!

10:21.455 --> 10:23.388
                 Get your own
                 weird talents.

10:23.390 --> 10:27.325
     Struggling to poke
     the straw into
     a juice pouch is my thing!

10:27.327 --> 10:29.127
 Come on, man,
 this is crazy!

10:29.129 --> 10:32.998
 You can't just lay claim
 to anything past,
 present, or future.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.698
                Oh, yes, I can!

10:33.700 --> 10:37.769
          And I'm gonna keep on
          doing it till you're
          left with nothing.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.005
                  (WHISPERS)
                  Nothing.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.741
   ADULT ADAM: <i> Barry had just</i>
  <i> declared war on me.</i>

10:42.743 --> 10:43.041
                       Nothing!

10:43.043 --> 10:47.112
   ADULT ADAM: <i> Meanwhile,</i>
  <i> my dad was entering</i>
  <i> a battlefield of his own.</i>

10:47.114 --> 10:47.912
         Welcome home, darling.

10:47.914 --> 10:51.516
    Can I interest you
    in a cold beverage
    or a delicious beefy snack?

10:51.518 --> 10:53.952
 What is this?
              Have a seat, Mur.

10:53.954 --> 10:54.486
 Forget parties.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.322
       I know this is
       what you really
       wanted for you birthday.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.091
     Clearly a trap,
     but sure.

11:00.961 --> 11:01.893
        Comfy?
               Quite.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.028
       Fantastic.
               Thank you.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.362
        It's a trap!
               I know.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.363
       Erica!

11:05.365 --> 11:08.967
 See, I've been scrapbooking
 our family for over 20 years.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.970
 And not only do you refuse
 to be in any of the photos,

11:11.972 --> 11:14.906
  the few times you are,
  you look like this.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.342
       What? That's how I look.
       That's my face.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.677
 You don't value
 any memories.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.846
 So you are gonna sit here
 and look at all these books

11:21.848 --> 11:24.115
     until you prove to me
     that you care about

11:24.117 --> 11:25.316
     our meaningful moments.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.686
         Bevy, this is how
         I was raised.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.887
        We don't make a fuss.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.555
         Doesn't mean I don't
         pay attention.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.891
          It's all up here
          in my brain.
       Oh, please.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.428
     This noggin is the world's
     greatest scrapbook.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.495
     Which baby is this?

11:37.497 --> 11:40.331
        Which moron?
             Uh... the moron.

11:40.333 --> 11:44.436
        Eri-baaaarry-aaaadam.

11:44.438 --> 11:47.772
 That's it. I guess you're
 gonna be looking
 at these books

11:47.774 --> 11:50.308
 until your 60th birthday.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.344
   Son of a bitch.
   How many of these are there?

11:53.346 --> 11:56.581
 Well, this is just the first
 nine months of my life.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.249
  ADULT ADAM: <i> While my mother</i>
 <i> turned up the heat,</i>

11:58.251 --> 12:01.219
      <i> I was about</i>
      <i> to turn the tables</i>
      <i> on Barry.</i>

12:01.221 --> 12:03.254
 What am I looking at?

12:03.256 --> 12:04.856
      Oh, I'm just chiling
      in my Flyers shirt,

12:04.858 --> 12:07.859
      eating Boo Berry,
      watching Jean-Claude
      Van Damme,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.027
  you know, classic me stuff.

12:09.029 --> 12:12.030
    That is not classic you,
    it's classic me.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.064
         Too bad you didn't
         call it.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.666
       I mean, you gave me
       a specific list,

12:14.668 --> 12:15.934
      and none of this stuff
      was on it.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.903
     Everyone knows
     I own spooky cereal,

12:18.905 --> 12:20.405
  Flyers gear, and JC Van D.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.074
 It goes without saying!
 Turn off that movie right now!

12:23.076 --> 12:25.243
        Ooh, I would if it were
        a Chuck Norris flick,

12:25.245 --> 12:29.180
           but JC Van D
           wasn't on your list,
           so now he's on mine.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.482
   You take off my shirt

12:30.484 --> 12:33.218
     and step away from
     the Boo Berry,
     I mean it.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.621
        Should I step away from
        the cereal like this?

12:37.657 --> 12:40.291
 Don't you dare moonwalk
 away from that cereal.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.827
 I own that move that
 Michael Jackson made up!

12:42.829 --> 12:44.662
        But you didn't call it,
        and I did!

12:44.664 --> 12:46.798
   Those are fighting words,
   and you know it.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.732
       Go ahead. I already have

12:47.734 --> 12:51.936
       my favorite martial arts
       weaponry to protect me.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.973
 No, I called 'chukin!
 I remember listing it off.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.674
     Yeah, you picked Bo staff,

12:56.676 --> 12:59.043
             which is basically
             just a long stick!

12:59.045 --> 13:00.011
      What do you want?

13:00.013 --> 13:03.748
  I want the trotters of Harlem
  who travel around the globe.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.618
      You give them to me,
      and you can be you again.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.154
         Fine, take your stick.
         Never.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.956
           I've got a rap album
           to cut. Peace.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.625
     How could I forget rap?

13:13.627 --> 13:16.327
 I called competitive kiting,
 but not rap?

13:16.329 --> 13:18.029
  ADULT ADAM: <i> Yep,</i>
 <i> I was great at being Barry.</i>

13:18.031 --> 13:20.365
  <i> Only problem, he was</i>
  <i> just as great at being me.</i>

13:20.367 --> 13:22.700
   Greetings, earthling.
             What are you doing
             in my room?

13:22.702 --> 13:24.869
 Just diving into
 the world of nerd stuff

13:24.871 --> 13:25.870
        I love that you
        never called.

13:25.872 --> 13:29.541
 You know, playing with He-Guy,
 stretching Neil Armstrong,

13:29.543 --> 13:31.943
    playing with this
    weirdly hot cat lady.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.111
               That's Cheetara.
 Cheetabra.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.112
         Her precognition...
 Prenition.

13:34.114 --> 13:34.979
        ...and immense speed...
       Fence speed.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.448
           ...make her an asset
           to the Thundercats.
       the Tundra Dads.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.082
                Okay, I get it.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.951
          You're trying to take
          my things now.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.486
 Is that what's going on?

13:41.488 --> 13:44.122
  I was wondering why Barry
  was insisting

13:44.124 --> 13:47.025
 I hang out with him
 and give him sage advice.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.326
 Not now, old best friend.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.629
  I'm busy filming a movie,
  which is mine now.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.263
 I call all of movie-making.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.867
 Big action scene happens!
 Boom, Hollywood!
      (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

13:55.869 --> 13:56.868
 It's tedious, but fun.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.404
    You're moving her too fast.
    It's gonna look weird.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.106
         Do you mind?
         This is my movie.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.908
    Wow,
    this is a commitment.

14:03.910 --> 14:07.145
  Move faster.
  I'm wasting my life here.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.848
 I could be outside
 riding my bike around.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.249
    How do you do this
    all day long?

14:11.251 --> 14:13.284
           Don't you get it?
           This isn't a threat.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.652
 I hate your hobbies!

14:14.654 --> 14:15.854
 Globetrotters are mine!

14:15.856 --> 14:18.890
     Okay, this meshugaas
     has gone on long enough.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.659
   There's must be some way
   to work this out.

14:21.661 --> 14:22.961
   Fine, nerd.
   I'll play for it.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.797
  Winner takes all,
  both globe and Trotters.

14:25.799 --> 14:27.932
              Fine. But we play
              by their rules.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.335
      It's not about who scores
      the most points,

14:30.337 --> 14:31.469
              but who scores
              the most laughs!

14:31.471 --> 14:34.939
    You want funny?
    No crowd can resist
    my antics.

14:34.941 --> 14:35.607
  Look what I'm doing.

14:35.609 --> 14:38.276
 Look at the way my body's
 moving right now.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.377
              Ahh-ahh-ahh-choo!

14:39.379 --> 14:42.814
  Oh no! I'm sneezing hilarity!

14:42.816 --> 14:44.983
           'Cause laughter's
           the best medicine.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.818
                 Antics!
 You want comedy?

14:46.820 --> 14:48.319
   These aren't real, dude.
 (ARMPIT FARTING)

14:48.321 --> 14:51.322
 That's just my hand cupped
 into my sweaty armpit.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.458
 I'm the greatest basketball
 player alive!

14:53.460 --> 14:56.928
     And I'm the most pregnant!
     Look at me, sports fans.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.197
        I'm with child,
        and you love me for it.

14:59.199 --> 15:02.400
 And I'm a doctor delivering
 your ball baby!

15:02.402 --> 15:04.102
             No, no! Aah!

15:04.104 --> 15:07.405
         This is a sad day
         for Harlem.

15:08.475 --> 15:12.210
 Sorry, no TV until you
 go through every scrapbook.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.746
      You know, I've given this
      a lot of thought.

15:14.748 --> 15:18.549
         And I realize
         I do mark the moments.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.751
           As a matter of fact,

15:19.753 --> 15:22.987
          I kind of have my own
          scrapbook collection.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.822
   You? Scrapbooks?

15:24.824 --> 15:29.093
        Take my hand, I want to
        show you something.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.528
             (��)

15:30.530 --> 15:35.566
 This. This right here,
 this is how I mark the moment.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.601
     These are our tax returns.

15:36.603 --> 15:42.540
 To you. To me,
 they're reminders
 of us, of our family.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.842
 Every receipt has a memory.

15:44.844 --> 15:48.713
 This right here, this is
 where Erica got her braces.

15:48.715 --> 15:49.314
 (LAUGHS) And look at this!

15:49.316 --> 15:52.116
 This is where we bought Adam
 his first video camera!

15:52.118 --> 15:55.853
     Wow, these receipts really
     mean a lot to you, huh?

15:55.855 --> 15:56.955
 They mean everything.

15:56.957 --> 16:01.526
  And I keep them all here
  in my heart file.

16:01.795 --> 16:02.460
                  Oh, Murray.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.263
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> That's the thing</i>
  <i> about marking the moment,</i>

16:05.265 --> 16:07.365
      <i> everyone does it</i>
      <i> in their own way.</i>

16:07.367 --> 16:09.634
       What a crock of (BLEEP)

16:09.636 --> 16:14.072
           I mean, tax returns?
           In your heart file?
           Really?

16:14.074 --> 16:17.175
 Look. I had it rough
 as a child,

16:17.177 --> 16:19.744
     and I just realized
     that my dad...

16:19.746 --> 16:20.011
                     Boo!

16:20.013 --> 16:22.880
 You're not buying it,
 not even the stuff about
 the mean dad?

16:22.882 --> 16:25.049
                  No.
 So Mom didn't buy
 your tax thing?

16:25.051 --> 16:26.851
     She did not.
      And you added the stuff

16:26.853 --> 16:28.086
  about your crappy childhood?

16:28.088 --> 16:28.920
      I did.
                 You know,

16:28.922 --> 16:31.956
           you've always acted
           like you don't care.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.325
          I guess, in my heart,

16:34.327 --> 16:35.560
    I hoped it was all a front,

16:35.562 --> 16:40.331
     but if none of this really
     means anything to you,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.667
         then I'll stop trying.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.908
    ADULT ADAM: <i> It was time</i>
   <i> for me and Barry</i>

16:50.910 --> 16:54.479
<i> to face off in the biggest</i>
<i> athletic matchup of our lives!</i>

16:54.481 --> 16:55.980
             (��)

16:56.316 --> 16:58.850
      Okay, you know the rules.
      First man to make Ruben

16:58.852 --> 17:00.785
          and his crew crack up
          wins the game.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.487
    Is this gonna take long?
    'Cause we got practice.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.623
  Trust me, time flies when
  you're laughing your ass off.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.425
    ADULT ADAM: <i> This was it.</i>
   <i> Globetrotter versus</i>
   <i> Globetrotter</i>

17:08.428 --> 17:09.560
     <i> for the ultimate</i>
     <i> Globetrotter title!</i>

17:09.561 --> 17:12.030
 ALL: Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
 Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

17:12.031 --> 17:14.565
    Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
    Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

17:14.567 --> 17:17.001
 They're all passing
 in a circle.
 It makes no sense!

17:17.002 --> 17:19.470
  ADULT ADAM: <i> It really didn't.</i>
<i> And worst of all,</i>

17:19.472 --> 17:23.374
   <i> our antics amused no one</i>
   <i> and confused everyone.</i>

17:23.376 --> 17:24.575
        They're all in
        the same uniform.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.477
        I can't tell who's
        on what team.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.383
      Loose ball,
      somebody grab it already!

17:32.385 --> 17:36.687
   ADULT ADAM: <i> We were forced</i>
  <i> to bring out</i>
  <i> the big guns. The worm!</i>

17:36.923 --> 17:39.924
 Look at this court.
    <i> After that, our game</i>
    <i> descended into desperation</i>

17:39.926 --> 17:42.727
     <i> and shoddy ventriloquism.</i>
 It's my family reunion!

17:42.729 --> 17:46.164
  ADULT ADAM: <i> Lucky for Barry,</i>
 <i> he had one last</i>
 <i> trick up his sleeve...</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:48.633
   <i> the classic Globetrotter</i>
   <i> surprise pantsing.</i>

17:48.635 --> 17:53.938
 No! Dude,
 you can't pants yourself!
 That ruins the whole thing!

17:53.940 --> 17:55.606
 Pull them up so I can do it!

17:55.608 --> 17:56.541
              Never!

17:56.543 --> 17:57.909
             You can't un-pants
             someone.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.110
       That's just helping them
       get dressed.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.279
            No! No!
    Pull them up! Pull them up!

18:01.281 --> 18:03.147
 Stop! Stop the game.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.250
    You guys took something
    beautiful and silly
    and made it ugly and silly.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.852
       It's zero-zero.
                But who won?

18:07.854 --> 18:09.087
         Nobody scored a point.

18:09.089 --> 18:09.654
           But who was funnier?

18:09.656 --> 18:12.623
   It kind of seems like you
   need a win so...you.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.025
       ALL: Whoo!
                   Winner!

18:14.027 --> 18:17.395
  Ha! It's official!
  The Globetrotters
  are my thing!

18:17.397 --> 18:18.229
 Add it to the list.

18:18.231 --> 18:23.267
   Meadowlark, Curly,
   the other randoms.
   Mine!

18:23.269 --> 18:24.969
                Fine. Take 'em.

18:24.971 --> 18:25.837
               Take everything.

18:25.839 --> 18:28.806
          You win, so I'll stay
          out of your life.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.775
  ADULT ADAM:
<i> Sure, Barry had won the game,</i>

18:30.777 --> 18:35.346
  <i> but, at that moment,</i>
  <i> he realized he'd lost me.</i>

18:35.348 --> 18:38.683
 <i> As for my dad, he finally</i>
 <i> understood what my mom meant</i>

18:38.685 --> 18:41.252
     <i> about capturing</i>
     <i> meaningful moments.</i>

18:41.254 --> 18:44.522
<i> And for the first time, he</i>
<i> wanted to be the one to do it.</i>

18:44.524 --> 18:47.992
      <i> � Each day, I live</i>
      <i> I want to be</i>

18:47.994 --> 18:49.360
         ALL: Surprise!

18:49.596 --> 18:50.795
   Oh, my God,
   look at her face.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.830
     That's the real deal!
       <i> � A day to give</i>
       <i> the best of me</i>

18:52.832 --> 18:57.401
    Are you throwing a surprise
    party for you...for me?

18:57.403 --> 18:58.536
 You know I hate all the fuss,

18:58.538 --> 19:01.239
 but you're right.
      <i> � I'm only one,</i>
      <i> but not alone</i>

19:01.241 --> 19:02.773
  I should be
  in the moment more.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.376
 And that's what I'm doing.
      <i> � My finest day</i>
      <i> is yet unknown</i>

19:05.378 --> 19:07.945
 Marking the moment...
 with you.

19:07.947 --> 19:11.249
                 Aww, sweetie.
      <i> � I broke my heart,</i>
      <i> fought every gain</i>

19:11.251 --> 19:16.621
         This is the best
         surprise party for you
         I've ever not thrown.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.622
   ALL: Speech!

19:17.624 --> 19:19.557
  All right. Well...

19:19.559 --> 19:22.660
 Everyone knows I'm not
 much for words or parties.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.763
    <i> � I rise and fall,</i>
    <i> yet through it all</i>
 But, um, I have to say,

19:25.765 --> 19:28.232
     looking out and seeing
     all of you...
<i> � This much remains</i>

19:28.234 --> 19:32.637
 ...that's gonna stay with me
 for a long time.
<i> � I want one moment in time</i>

19:32.639 --> 19:33.104
        For your scrapbook!

19:33.106 --> 19:36.841
  ADULT ADAM: <i> With that, my dad</i>
<i> finally marked the moment.</i>

19:36.843 --> 19:39.143
 <i> As for me, I'd finally</i>
 <i> given sports back to Barry,</i>

19:39.145 --> 19:42.146
  <i> or so I thought.</i>
 <i> � When I'm more</i>
 <i> than I thought I could be</i>

19:42.148 --> 19:46.184
  Hey, so, I know you're making
  one of your movies and all

19:46.186 --> 19:48.753
        but I thought maybe we
        could shoot some hoops.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.254
 No, sports are your thing.

19:50.256 --> 19:53.324
       Yeah, I guess that's why
       I went so crazy.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.093
 <i> � And the answers</i>
 <i> are all up to me</i>
               It's just...

19:56.095 --> 19:58.596
 I'm supposed to be the athlete
 of the family, you know?

19:58.598 --> 20:02.333
         If you start liking
         the Globetrotters,
         then who am I?

20:02.902 --> 20:05.269
  But after our little showdown
  in the gym,

20:05.271 --> 20:08.005
   I'm thinking this is
   the one thing we can share.

20:08.374 --> 20:12.043
          Come on,
          I'll be the Generals.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.679
 Okay,
 just like we practiced.

20:15.949 --> 20:16.914
          And...
            Look, I'm doing it!

20:16.916 --> 20:18.883
  ADULT ADAM: <i> So maybe I'd never</i>
<i> be great at sports</i>

20:18.885 --> 20:21.586
  <i> and didn't have a ton</i>
  <i> in common with my brother</i>

20:21.588 --> 20:25.323
  <i> but that night,</i>
  <i> we were on the same team.</i>

20:25.425 --> 20:26.691
<i> That's the thing about family.</i>

20:26.693 --> 20:28.859
     <i> For all the fighting</i>
     <i> and surprises,</i>

20:28.861 --> 20:32.063
   <i> it's the little moments</i>
   <i> that make us remember</i>

20:32.065 --> 20:33.598
   <i> how lucky we really are.</i>

20:33.600 --> 20:37.602
       <i> � I will be,</i>
       <i> I will be free �</i>

20:37.604 --> 20:41.672
     ALL: <i> � Happy birthday,</i>
    <i> dear Murray</i>

20:41.674 --> 20:46.577
  <i> � Happy birthday to you! �</i>

20:48.014 --> 20:50.214
 So did you have fun, Dad?
             I had a good time.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.917
 Good 50th birthday?
