01:09.127 --> 01:12.281
Most girls my age are obsessed
with pretty similar things.

01:13.112 --> 01:14.169
Fun things.

01:14.862 --> 01:16.519
Some are obsessed with flirting.

01:19.059 --> 01:20.902
Something more than flirting.

01:23.196 --> 01:25.141
Some are obsessed with their ride.

01:27.559 --> 01:30.179
Or whether to wear Really Ruby Red

01:30.241 --> 01:31.482
or Silver City Pink.

01:39.483 --> 01:41.962
Me... I was obsessed too.

01:49.975 --> 01:52.151
I was obsessed with post-its.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.754
Post-its and death.

01:59.271 --> 02:01.485
I was beyond obsessed.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.573
Did you write my name on my post-it ?

02:11.574 --> 02:12.332
What ?

02:12.333 --> 02:15.632
Did you write my name on my post-it ?

02:15.696 --> 02:16.798
The one where I died.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.529
Georgia, I'm not a
big fan of the drop-by.

02:19.615 --> 02:20.820
Well, I want to know.

02:21.053 --> 02:23.351
The drop-by is... It's a discourtesy.

02:23.816 --> 02:25.396
Polite society has a protocol,

02:25.461 --> 02:27.948
an agreed-upon time and
place, you make plans.

02:28.408 --> 02:29.526
Kinda like a post-it.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.313
I was in the middle of a
sentence when you knocked.

02:31.364 --> 02:33.911
The written sentence in a book but I
had to put it down because you knocked.

02:34.051 --> 02:36.283
I was in the middle of
something when you knocked.

02:39.020 --> 02:40.650
Does it matter who wrote your post-it ?

02:40.717 --> 02:41.658
Here's what I know.

02:41.838 --> 02:43.272
You get a list of names

02:43.323 --> 02:47.601
and you transfer the 1st initial, last
name, time and place onto a post-it.

02:48.574 --> 02:50.106
But you get more than that.

02:51.347 --> 02:52.140
That's right.

02:52.141 --> 02:53.529
What else do you get ?

02:54.258 --> 02:56.108
Is my name still in here somewhere ?

02:56.750 --> 02:58.330
What else does it say about me ?

02:59.228 --> 03:00.709
What else does it say about me ?

03:02.486 --> 03:05.114
Oh what is this ? Like
Santa Klaus' list ?

03:05.400 --> 03:08.138
Does it say who's bad and who's good ?

03:08.926 --> 03:11.782
Does it say that I was 18 years old ?

03:12.070 --> 03:13.452
That I never had a boyfriend ?

03:13.495 --> 03:15.438
That I didn't even have
my driver's license ?

03:15.506 --> 03:18.385
Did it say that I had
never done anything ?

03:18.786 --> 03:20.820
Do you know anything
about Persian mythology ?

03:21.975 --> 03:24.922
Persian mythology says on the
last day there's a reckoning.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.734
There's an old-fashioned scale.

03:28.069 --> 03:30.468
You got one side for light,
one side for darkness.

03:30.921 --> 03:31.854
Good, evil.

03:32.993 --> 03:34.685
Everybody steps onto the pan,

03:35.762 --> 03:37.282
sees how they measure up.

03:37.991 --> 03:39.842
The world wants it all to make sense.

03:39.963 --> 03:42.262
The world wants... all that add up.

03:42.824 --> 03:45.302
The world wants... balance.

03:47.191 --> 03:48.809
This is your response ?

03:49.014 --> 03:53.472
Some story about some bullshit
weight station into the afterlife ?

03:53.982 --> 03:55.740
You're still here, George.

03:56.726 --> 03:59.317
I wanna be young and silly.

04:01.420 --> 04:04.821
You are young and silly.

04:07.517 --> 04:09.741
Georgia ! I wrote your
name on that post-it.

04:11.448 --> 04:14.349
I had not met you, I didn't
know how a great kid you are.

04:14.439 --> 04:18.060
But if I had known you, I would still
have written your name on the post-it.

04:19.456 --> 04:20.629
It's the way of the world.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.883
I think he's wrong.

04:30.030 --> 04:31.638
I don't think it all adds up.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.137
I don't think any of it makes sense.

04:39.383 --> 04:41.884
I don't see any fucking
balance in the world.

04:43.823 --> 04:45.064
It's all about luck.

04:45.393 --> 04:47.466
Either you're lucky, or you're not.

04:51.131 --> 04:52.724
And I'm not.

04:53.288 --> 04:54.815
This is bullshit.

04:57.603 --> 04:59.044
She sold the Slater's house.

05:00.062 --> 05:02.595
She got 50,000 over asking.

05:03.985 --> 05:06.006
Alright, she's their
top realtor, Clancy.

05:06.385 --> 05:08.649
She's ambitious and ruthless.

05:08.847 --> 05:10.044
Right up your alley.

05:12.272 --> 05:14.198
I think Reggie's upstairs.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.797
Reggie ? Reggie ?

05:23.761 --> 05:25.383
Can't find her. Bye.

05:27.143 --> 05:29.039
I don't see why we
have to sell the house.

05:29.847 --> 05:32.045
Well, how about half
of it is your father's ?

05:32.604 --> 05:34.003
Can't we just buy his half ?

05:34.294 --> 05:36.005
I don't have that kind of money.

05:36.665 --> 05:38.509
Well I guess you'll
have to go back to work.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.589
Reggie, going back to work, you know,

05:41.662 --> 05:44.861
would require a major lifestyle
change for me, you know,

05:44.922 --> 05:45.916
for both of us.

05:45.918 --> 05:48.949
So I have to live in
some cheesy apartment

05:49.073 --> 05:50.376
just because you're lazy ?

05:51.325 --> 05:53.591
Do you remember what my job was ?

05:53.857 --> 05:54.824
Secretary.

05:54.825 --> 05:56.378
Legal secretary.

05:56.497 --> 05:59.380
And lawyers are very angry people.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.559
Don't you remember how incredibly
unhappy I was when I came home ?

06:03.090 --> 06:05.202
You're always incredibly unhappy.

06:05.601 --> 06:07.119
No, I'm not.

06:07.764 --> 06:09.388
Unhappy in the cheesy apartment,

06:10.298 --> 06:11.988
unhappy in the big house...

06:24.795 --> 06:27.261
Excuse me ! Can I
borrow your salt please ?

06:30.478 --> 06:31.451
Thank you.

06:33.565 --> 06:34.558
Roxy...

06:35.386 --> 06:37.739
Can I see your new
police revolver please ?

06:38.259 --> 06:39.922
- No.
- Please.

06:40.877 --> 06:41.876
No.

06:42.781 --> 06:44.011
I just wanna hold it, Roxy.

06:44.490 --> 06:45.458
No.

06:45.924 --> 06:48.371
Look, I won't shoot you, I
promise, promise, promise.

06:48.422 --> 06:51.749
I just want it...
filling my hands. Please !

06:51.891 --> 06:52.682
No !

06:52.683 --> 06:53.839
And stop asking me.

06:56.690 --> 07:00.634
Give me the gun ! Give me
the gun ! Give me the gun !

07:00.707 --> 07:03.756
You are really working
my nerves this morning.

07:07.388 --> 07:09.013
You don't have the weight force.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.702
You wish you had a pair like mine, baby.

07:11.995 --> 07:13.951
And a gun like that.

07:15.133 --> 07:16.184
Here's your juice, hon'.

07:16.651 --> 07:17.623
Thanks.

07:19.544 --> 07:21.622
Is it too much to ask
to eat my eggs in peace ?

07:21.727 --> 07:23.728
Just let the little man hold the gun.

07:37.214 --> 07:38.340
Luck's everywhere.

07:38.552 --> 07:40.132
Just drifting in the breeze.

07:40.861 --> 07:44.201
And the bad luck that's floating
around has to land on somebody.

07:44.567 --> 07:45.940
And whoever it lands on...

07:46.380 --> 07:49.618
well, people find
ways to even the score.

08:08.846 --> 08:11.040
My parents are selling my house.

08:11.506 --> 08:12.581
You want anything, sweaty ?

08:12.911 --> 08:13.854
No, thanks.

08:14.183 --> 08:16.269
The house I grew up
in, they're selling it.

08:16.379 --> 08:19.779
- How much ? - I have no
idea. - How much is the check ?

08:19.895 --> 08:22.139
Why would they do this ?
They loved our house.

08:22.278 --> 08:24.154
- Just doesn't add up.
- It doesn't add up.

08:24.243 --> 08:26.484
- What's the problem ?
- We lived there for 20 years.

08:26.551 --> 08:28.245
What's the problem with the check ?

08:28.279 --> 08:30.522
- She didn't charge us enough.
- Let's pay it and run.

08:30.669 --> 08:32.171
We most certainly will not.

08:32.256 --> 08:33.759
Right, Johnny Law on the spot.

08:33.836 --> 08:35.129
They just up and leaving.

08:35.198 --> 08:36.894
She didn't charge me for my fruit salad.

08:36.956 --> 08:38.957
- Doesn't make sense.
- It makes sense.

08:39.207 --> 08:40.365
Cops eat free.

08:40.418 --> 08:42.320
It doesn't make sense
her parents are moving.

08:42.392 --> 08:43.780
That's what I'm saying.

08:43.844 --> 08:46.541
Maybe it's just too painful to
walk by your bedroom everyday.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.390
It's not like they need
the extra-space because

08:48.446 --> 08:50.895
when she kicked the bucket,
they gained an extra-door.

08:51.856 --> 08:53.646
Roxy, do me a favor...

08:53.824 --> 08:54.806
Shoot him !

08:54.813 --> 08:55.763
Gladly !

08:57.791 --> 08:59.350
SO far ahead of this bid.

08:59.385 --> 09:00.306
I was joking.

09:00.832 --> 09:01.556
Roxy...

09:01.557 --> 09:02.496
Look at you !

09:02.546 --> 09:04.659
You think you're so
bloody special, don't you ?

09:04.731 --> 09:09.669
Prancing around in your tight blue
trousers and your big shiny gun.

09:09.899 --> 09:11.961
but let me tell you
something, sweetheart.

09:12.434 --> 09:13.883
Cops don't eat free.

09:14.129 --> 09:15.879
People hate cops.

09:16.150 --> 09:19.034
Please don't. I've had
a bad morning already.

09:19.194 --> 09:20.839
Excuse me, Kiffany.

09:22.597 --> 09:24.540
Hi, could you settle a dispute for us ?

09:24.635 --> 09:25.580
What is it, sweetheart ?

09:25.581 --> 09:28.393
Do officers of the law
receive complimentary meals ?

09:28.663 --> 09:30.313
- No.
- Ah ah ah !

09:30.544 --> 09:33.014
Coffee's free. You
want some more coffee ?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.024
No, thank you.

09:34.310 --> 09:37.117
So what ? You just neglected to
charge her for her fruit salad ?

09:37.287 --> 09:38.189
Well...

09:39.395 --> 09:41.405
Look at that ! You're right.

09:41.712 --> 09:43.039
I'll get you a new check.

09:46.744 --> 09:47.843
Jesus Christ !

09:50.702 --> 09:52.284
Fucking hell !

09:53.031 --> 09:55.147
So they're selling your childhood home ?

09:55.741 --> 09:56.685
Yes !

09:57.002 --> 09:58.360
That's a shame, sweaty.

09:58.937 --> 09:59.922
It's not fair.

10:00.409 --> 10:02.242
That fucking hurt.

10:02.612 --> 10:03.600
It does hurt.

10:04.026 --> 10:06.880
It's like sometimes the world
just doesn't make any sense.

10:29.005 --> 10:30.130
Pardon me.

10:33.721 --> 10:34.854
Hey ! Can I get a soda ?

10:55.710 --> 10:59.764
- Five-letter word
"accidental fish". - Fluke.

11:13.274 --> 11:16.750
Time to generate a new
revenue stream. Behold !

11:17.481 --> 11:19.472
Oh Mason, Mason, Mason...

11:19.978 --> 11:21.177
Are you drinking again ?

11:21.277 --> 11:22.207
No.

11:22.845 --> 11:24.252
Say "as God is my witness".

11:24.335 --> 11:25.291
I don't believe in God.

11:25.984 --> 11:27.539
Now what about a little wager ?

11:28.451 --> 11:30.456
Come on ! Guess where the pea is !

11:30.521 --> 11:33.735
Where is the pea ? Where is the pea ?

11:34.082 --> 11:35.501
Put a dollar down. Come on !

11:36.076 --> 11:38.321
A George Washington from Georgy girl.

11:42.151 --> 11:44.117
Is it under this one ?

11:44.369 --> 11:45.511
Could it be under this one ?

11:45.952 --> 11:47.412
Or is it this one ?

11:47.833 --> 11:48.879
Where could it be ?

11:49.020 --> 11:49.954
Where is the pea ?

11:50.025 --> 11:51.722
Guess ! And win a dollar !

11:53.591 --> 11:55.567
- The middle one.
- Nop !

11:56.304 --> 11:58.152
Oh by George ! She's got it !

11:58.246 --> 11:59.774
You are drinking again.

12:00.054 --> 12:02.610
Okay, so give me the money
back and we'll start all again.

12:02.747 --> 12:04.190
Hmmm no !

12:04.255 --> 12:05.775
Yes because that was practice, alright ?

12:05.846 --> 12:07.224
And you just lost a dollar.

12:10.869 --> 12:11.906
Morning boys and girls !

12:13.890 --> 12:14.731
How's everybody ?

12:14.732 --> 12:16.599
Having a lovely day,
thank you. How about you ?

12:16.882 --> 12:18.982
- Still wearing those sticks, huh ?
- I am.

12:19.067 --> 12:21.498
Find yourself a cross,
suddenly you're a catholic.

12:21.558 --> 12:23.969
I think it looks really
pretty on me, don't you ?

12:24.605 --> 12:27.578
You know, George, you
have your very own saint.

12:27.699 --> 12:28.698
I'd rather have a pony.

12:29.097 --> 12:31.527
Saint George is the patron saint of

12:31.597 --> 12:35.263
farmers, soldiers, boy scouts,
cavalry, chivalry and England.

12:35.477 --> 12:36.936
I want a saint. Have I got a saint ?

12:37.156 --> 12:38.150
Yeah, Saint Thomas.

12:38.441 --> 12:39.456
What about Saint Mason ?

12:39.624 --> 12:42.295
Thomas is the patron saint of
masons. There's no Saint Mason.

12:42.364 --> 12:44.817
But saints are marvelous, there's
a patron saint for everything.

12:44.971 --> 12:49.008
Patron saint for lost causes, patron saint
for being depressed, patron saint for...

12:49.091 --> 12:50.848
Being bored out of your skull.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.851
Do you know what the
Holy Trinity is, George ?

12:52.894 --> 12:54.352
We are in a fucking restaurant.

12:54.845 --> 12:56.865
It's peppers, onions and celery.

12:57.534 --> 13:00.694
Would a little ritual in
her life do her any harm ?

13:00.864 --> 13:02.310
I have a little ritual myself.

13:03.289 --> 13:04.309
Let us begin.

13:05.121 --> 13:05.996
Nothing for me ?

13:05.997 --> 13:08.653
Not unless you got one under
your pretty little shells.

13:09.010 --> 13:10.748
Don't you usually
ride a bike over here ?

13:11.336 --> 13:12.129
Yes.

13:12.130 --> 13:13.678
- Did you ride it today ?
- Yes.

13:13.781 --> 13:14.772
Well, it's not out there.

13:14.773 --> 13:15.730
What ?

13:15.755 --> 13:16.788
Your bike is gone.

13:18.185 --> 13:20.568
I gave you that bike.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.565
This better be a joke.

13:23.506 --> 13:24.522
Is it really gone ?

13:26.971 --> 13:28.654
Let me see your version
of the shell game.

13:28.773 --> 13:31.257
I could really use a laugh this morning.

13:33.102 --> 13:34.077
Come on !

13:34.322 --> 13:35.782
Quit fucking around. Play !

13:49.400 --> 13:51.915
Someone stole my bike !

13:59.346 --> 14:00.837
Someone stole my bike !

14:01.417 --> 14:02.807
We got that. Did you lock it ?

14:02.919 --> 14:04.117
Yes, I locked it.

14:04.201 --> 14:05.531
All there's left is one tire.

14:05.623 --> 14:06.555
Which tire ?

14:06.731 --> 14:08.028
The tire that was locked !

14:08.053 --> 14:09.420
I had a feeling you'd lose that bike.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.735
You gotta make the
figure 8 with your hands.

14:15.059 --> 14:16.616
You don't have to be so huffy about it.

14:16.688 --> 14:18.112
I've lost my pea now.

14:18.438 --> 14:20.341
What ? You're blaming me ?

14:20.732 --> 14:23.635
When something is lost, someone has
to be blamed, isn't that the theory ?

14:24.991 --> 14:26.293
If not you then who  ?

14:26.786 --> 14:30.420
The designer of the bike for making something
so beautiful that someone else covets it ?

14:30.471 --> 14:32.806
Or maybe we should blame me or maybe
we should assign no blame at all.

14:32.870 --> 14:35.216
Daisy's people would say "He
giveth and he taketh away".

14:36.127 --> 14:37.759
I blame the guy who took it.

14:38.036 --> 14:39.081
I'd get revenge.

14:39.114 --> 14:41.222
You know, an eye for an
eye, a Schwinn for a Schwinn.

14:41.341 --> 14:42.934
I would steal somebody else's bike.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.005
That's a bad idea.

14:44.422 --> 14:47.155
Okay, Roxy's big, bad and blue
now. Why don't you ask her ?

14:47.257 --> 14:48.173
That's a great idea.

14:48.243 --> 14:49.428
Rube, can I borrow your truck ?

14:49.459 --> 14:50.596
Are you a responsible driver ?

14:50.639 --> 14:52.082
I am a an excellent driver.

14:52.164 --> 14:54.113
I promise I'll take care
of your piece of shit truck.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.325
Well, that's not the
response I was looking for.

14:56.544 --> 14:57.733
Oh fine !

15:01.350 --> 15:02.285
George !

15:02.812 --> 15:03.739
What ?

15:06.179 --> 15:08.129
Sometimes pretty things just disappear.

15:08.624 --> 15:10.488
Well, I guess that's just my bad luck.

15:12.298 --> 15:13.288
Show me the hands.

15:14.612 --> 15:16.902
Winner or loser ? Winner or loser ?

15:17.436 --> 15:18.696
Which will it be ?

15:18.976 --> 15:20.332
Only time will tell.

15:20.979 --> 15:23.561
Here today... Gone in a moment !

15:24.501 --> 15:26.556
What's under the middle one ?

15:48.917 --> 15:50.450
It's squishy.

15:51.968 --> 15:54.116
I'm gonna squish if you
get any clay on that table.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.111
We'll clean it.

15:56.332 --> 15:58.421
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

15:58.595 --> 16:00.331
You know, George, when
you're all grown up,

16:00.421 --> 16:02.468
you are not gonna believe
how little you were.

16:03.319 --> 16:06.181
I'm not little. Reggie's little.

16:07.055 --> 16:09.695
Your father was kidding,
honey. You're a big girl.

16:12.934 --> 16:14.930
Okay, let's do the left one.

16:28.942 --> 16:30.680
The world may try to mess with you.

16:31.136 --> 16:33.818
Out there it may be a
free-for-all but in here

16:34.084 --> 16:36.470
there's a system in
place to address that.

16:36.802 --> 16:37.756
Next !

16:38.294 --> 16:39.874
Maybe it's just the uniforms

16:39.977 --> 16:42.652
but in here it feels like
there's order in the world.

16:43.134 --> 16:43.977
Next !

16:43.978 --> 16:46.639
And if you just get the
facts onto the books, odds are

16:46.725 --> 16:48.334
the system takes care of you.

16:48.893 --> 16:51.657
Hi ! I'd like to report
the theft of my bicycle.

16:51.731 --> 16:53.619
It happened almost an
hour ago on Bay Street.

16:53.727 --> 16:54.701
Fill those out.

16:55.411 --> 16:56.345
What's this ?

16:56.551 --> 16:59.530
It's a Harvard law degree.
We're all very proud of you.

17:00.278 --> 17:02.250
Listen, I'm gonna be
really late for work.

17:02.327 --> 17:03.975
Can I just describe the bike to you

17:04.065 --> 17:06.489
and you can put out an APB or whatever ?

17:07.523 --> 17:08.430
No.

17:08.708 --> 17:09.616
Great !

17:13.303 --> 17:14.259
Excuse me.

17:15.413 --> 17:16.323
Thank you.

17:19.494 --> 17:20.669
Holy shit !

17:21.561 --> 17:22.699
Did you see this ?

17:24.491 --> 17:25.851
What happened to you, dear ?

17:27.275 --> 17:29.694
Someone stole my bike.

17:30.774 --> 17:33.104
And it was a really cool bike.

17:34.236 --> 17:36.901
A man fondled my behind on a city bus.

17:38.936 --> 17:41.932
There's no excuse for that.

17:43.220 --> 17:45.736
I think he was stabbed.

17:47.409 --> 17:49.341
Yep, assault with a deadly weapon...

17:49.432 --> 17:50.951
Netting needles.

17:51.194 --> 17:52.816
The shithead had it coming.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.896
Here we go !

17:58.114 --> 17:59.701
Here we go. Where we go ?

17:59.793 --> 18:01.328
Where we go ? Nobody knows.

18:03.029 --> 18:04.882
- That's your patter ?
- Patter's bullshit.

18:04.928 --> 18:06.379
Patter's how you draw people in.

18:06.511 --> 18:07.854
People are joining by the game

18:08.131 --> 18:10.395
and by my non-threatening good looks.

18:11.322 --> 18:12.751
Patter seduces.

18:13.680 --> 18:14.807
It's not your strong sell.

18:16.102 --> 18:17.029
There.

18:19.831 --> 18:21.918
You know why people
play the shell game ?

18:22.441 --> 18:24.212
Because they think
they can beat the odds.

18:24.309 --> 18:25.254
Wrong.

18:25.564 --> 18:26.945
They think they can beat you.

18:27.168 --> 18:28.648
They think they're smarter than you.

18:29.064 --> 18:30.220
In this case, they're right.

18:31.059 --> 18:32.351
I'm smarter than you think.

18:32.391 --> 18:33.695
You're smart enough to play stupid ?

18:33.833 --> 18:35.922
I'm so smart, I'm practically retarded.

18:39.150 --> 18:40.274
Are you drinking again ?

18:40.557 --> 18:41.434
No.

18:41.435 --> 18:42.381
Are you lying ?

18:42.438 --> 18:43.546
As God is my witness.

18:44.435 --> 18:46.054
Now where's the pea ? Follow the pea !

18:47.165 --> 18:50.738
5'll get to 10, 10'll get to 20, 50'll get
to 100, double your money, double your money,

18:50.795 --> 18:53.402
just catch it once. One
time ! One time ! One time !

18:56.173 --> 18:57.143
You need a rhythm.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.075
You need to hypnotize with your words.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.703
I can hypnotize with
my catlike movement.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.658
Now, how slick was that ?

19:15.210 --> 19:16.938
There's only one movement I care about.

19:16.985 --> 19:20.218
It happens everyday right about now,
there's nothing catlike about it.

19:20.758 --> 19:22.048
It's under the one on the right.

19:23.767 --> 19:24.687
Wrong !

19:25.321 --> 19:26.270
My right.

19:30.818 --> 19:32.186
I can do this !

19:47.941 --> 19:49.600
How is this low-priority ?

19:49.897 --> 19:51.365
It's petty theft list.

19:51.456 --> 19:53.082
It's a victimless crime.

19:53.271 --> 19:55.038
Victimless ? Then who the fuck am I ?

19:55.172 --> 19:57.527
And the language won't
make it a higher priority.

19:58.570 --> 19:59.638
Did I win anything ?

20:00.785 --> 20:03.276
Twenty scratch off and
I didn't get squatt ?

20:03.827 --> 20:04.970
What are the odds ?

20:05.074 --> 20:07.624
Who do I have to kill to get
some attention around here ?

20:09.083 --> 20:11.003
It's just an expression.

20:12.346 --> 20:15.389
I'll catch up with you, guys.
I'll take it from here, thanks.

20:15.494 --> 20:16.551
Thank God !

20:17.098 --> 20:18.211
You have to help me, Roxy.

20:18.330 --> 20:20.147
- It was a yellow bike.
- I can read.

20:20.272 --> 20:21.481
And it had a bell and...

20:21.636 --> 20:22.748
and a missing tire.

20:22.836 --> 20:25.556
George, I will treat this
with the respect it deserves.

20:26.675 --> 20:27.727
What does that mean ?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.425
Look, I'm happy to file a report.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.600
I'm happy to follow up.

20:30.694 --> 20:33.401
But don't expect anyone around
here to look after your bike.

20:33.675 --> 20:35.078
Somebody broke the law !

20:35.280 --> 20:36.477
Somebody has to pay !

20:37.160 --> 20:39.026
You're on the books, George.

20:39.949 --> 20:41.263
I'm on the books

20:41.512 --> 20:43.482
but the books don't really give a shit.

20:45.651 --> 20:49.098
In the end, the lesson the system
teaches you is pretty simple.

20:50.065 --> 20:51.178
You're on your own.

21:21.659 --> 21:23.568
What the hell ? Is it Saturday ?

21:24.025 --> 21:25.936
No. Staff meeting.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.650
How come you're not there ?

21:27.707 --> 21:28.681
Followings.

21:35.305 --> 21:36.283
THEFT

21:36.487 --> 21:39.456
Thieves Harm Everyone's Fun Times.

21:40.376 --> 21:41.757
Let's break it down, people.

21:42.656 --> 21:44.641
What do I mean when I say harm ?

21:45.545 --> 21:48.749
Harm who ? You ? Or the
cutie in the next cubicle ?

21:50.893 --> 21:52.813
The CEO ? The President ?

21:53.354 --> 21:56.840
- Everyone chain to the lowest...
- Someone stole my bike !

21:56.977 --> 22:00.572
And everyone in here is a thief
until proven otherwise including you.

22:01.170 --> 22:02.163
Freak !

22:02.223 --> 22:04.646
Oh ! Did I miss a joke ?

22:08.800 --> 22:10.010
Let me tell you something.

22:10.052 --> 22:13.411
Stealing company property is no joke.

22:14.092 --> 22:16.468
People think "oh the company
is sucking away my life,

22:16.535 --> 22:17.803
I'll just take something back."

22:17.982 --> 22:18.928
Who is this guy ?

22:19.147 --> 22:21.597
Security expert because
of all the supply theft.

22:21.653 --> 22:24.035
I didn't give you a promotion
so you'd show up an hour late.

22:24.154 --> 22:26.409
I was trying to find
my bike to get here.

22:26.563 --> 22:27.497
You !

22:27.609 --> 22:28.566
What's your name ?

22:28.705 --> 22:29.675
Millie.

22:29.914 --> 22:31.354
You like your life here, Millie ?

22:31.585 --> 22:32.733
Not so much.

22:32.894 --> 22:33.915
Tell him you're happy.

22:33.996 --> 22:34.945
I'm really happy.

22:34.977 --> 22:36.695
Good. Good...

22:37.116 --> 22:39.843
because you know what people do
when they're unhappy, don't you ?

22:40.002 --> 22:41.684
They... get a cat ?

22:42.715 --> 22:43.599
Not you !

22:43.600 --> 22:44.541
Wrong !

22:44.792 --> 22:45.935
They take staples

22:46.537 --> 22:48.854
or roller ball pens or...

22:49.446 --> 22:50.457
post-its !

22:52.096 --> 22:54.670
People who don't like
their life try to get even.

22:55.220 --> 22:58.956
And that makes Happy
Time an unhappy place.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.103
No matter how I tried to play the game,

23:01.204 --> 23:03.052
it wasn't coming out in my favor.

23:03.222 --> 23:06.603
Die, become reaper,
see family sell house,

23:06.885 --> 23:10.167
see bike get stolen, do not pass go.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.215
RIPOF

23:15.143 --> 23:24.159
Report Identify Prove Ostracize Fire.

23:24.407 --> 23:25.420
Ripof ?

23:25.860 --> 23:27.205
You got a problem there, Millie ?

23:27.459 --> 23:30.116
You misspelled rip-off. Dropped an "f".

23:30.264 --> 23:31.168
Oh I see.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.012
We have ourselves a smart-ass.

23:34.306 --> 23:36.108
Don't you mean "smart-as" ?

23:37.273 --> 23:38.285
Millie !

23:41.190 --> 23:43.464
Let me tell something there, Millie.

23:44.129 --> 23:46.419
I can't sing. I can't tap dance.

23:46.535 --> 23:47.917
I can't twirl a rifle.

23:48.591 --> 23:50.407
I have one talent, Millie.

23:51.101 --> 23:52.454
I fire troublemakers.

23:53.025 --> 23:56.527
I find troublemakers and I fire them.

23:57.072 --> 23:59.485
That's my talent, Millie. What's yours ?

23:59.786 --> 24:01.209
You don't wanna find out.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.643
Watch this one. I don't like her.

24:06.619 --> 24:09.341
R-I-P-O-F.

24:09.683 --> 24:10.718
Figure it out.

24:10.958 --> 24:14.508
'less you catch the bull by the horns.

24:22.262 --> 24:25.564
Huh.. well... huh... there're muffins.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.681
Do you feel lucky today ?

24:33.358 --> 24:34.697
Where is the pea ?

24:34.987 --> 24:36.784
Find the pea.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.195
The pea is under this shell.

24:48.739 --> 24:50.966
Just take the money. Take the money !

24:51.317 --> 24:52.575
Go away !

24:58.158 --> 24:59.589
How's that revenue stream running ?

25:00.346 --> 25:01.960
It's going really well actually, Rube.

25:02.039 --> 25:04.323
I've actually saved you
something from the earnings.

25:04.457 --> 25:06.304
Hang on. Where is it ? Let me find it...

25:06.363 --> 25:07.360
It's there !

25:20.101 --> 25:21.223
New car ?

25:23.955 --> 25:27.703
Yeah. It's a... it's a lease.

25:28.548 --> 25:30.052
Looks like a real chick magnet.

25:35.432 --> 25:36.415
Where's Reggie ?

25:36.798 --> 25:37.831
She's at school !

25:38.239 --> 25:41.415
You know... place to keep the
non-voters for 8 hours a day

25:41.498 --> 25:42.325
keep them out of trouble ?

25:42.326 --> 25:43.280
Yeah. Yeah...

25:43.354 --> 25:46.153
I was just nervous
about coming over here.

25:49.071 --> 25:50.050
So...

25:51.706 --> 25:52.625
Where do we start ?

25:52.979 --> 25:54.168
1983.

25:55.790 --> 25:56.959
It was a joke.

26:02.620 --> 26:04.228
I remember this.

26:04.587 --> 26:06.505
I stole this from that hotel in Maohi.

26:06.895 --> 26:08.533
We were both smoking on that trip.

26:08.758 --> 26:09.812
And drinking !

26:11.815 --> 26:13.576
It was a good vacation.

26:14.467 --> 26:15.446
The best.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.614
Well, since I stole
it, I guess it's mine.

26:33.932 --> 26:36.118
That's right, I'm the thief.

26:36.456 --> 26:37.887
I'm the cat burglar.

26:38.850 --> 26:40.346
Don't you eyeball me !

26:41.208 --> 26:44.423
Oh yeah like anyone wants
your fake Prada tote.

26:59.615 --> 27:02.885
Okay, death waits for no
man. Gotta go ! Gotta go !

27:08.327 --> 27:09.243
Millie !

27:09.536 --> 27:11.984
You're an hour late and you're
going somewhere already ?

27:12.209 --> 27:15.663
God ! I've forced with
12-step excuse into the ground.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.715
Something else, please !

27:19.288 --> 27:22.663
Dolores, I died a year ago
and became a grim reaper

27:22.738 --> 27:25.044
and someone at the Woodside
Mall is going to die in about

27:25.417 --> 27:27.196
20 minutes, probably violently.

27:27.274 --> 27:30.168
And I have to go take their
soul before they bite it.

27:33.288 --> 27:35.505
Well, that's stiff for you.

27:35.594 --> 27:37.258
I appreciate your understanding.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.094
That security guy really upset me !

27:44.188 --> 27:47.379
That whole... bull
with the horn thing...

27:47.457 --> 27:49.792
whatever that was... I have no idea but

27:49.877 --> 27:52.647
I'm on the edge here, Dolores,
and I need to go to a meeting.

27:52.735 --> 27:53.733
Say no more.

27:53.969 --> 27:55.562
Grant me the serenity.

27:55.639 --> 27:56.618
Okay ! thank you. Later.

27:56.747 --> 28:01.860
"I'm going to a meeting"... I'd bore
myself to death if I wasn't already dead.

28:06.911 --> 28:09.982
I'm telling you the kitchen guillotine
is the last slicer you'll ever buy.

28:10.213 --> 28:11.967
You like peppers ? It slices peppers.

28:12.048 --> 28:15.438
Look at that ! Easy as pie ! Just
right through the pepper like nothing.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.049
Pop that on there.

28:19.853 --> 28:21.230
Grill some meat on this, baby.

28:21.330 --> 28:22.844
And you're doing what I like to call:

28:23.028 --> 28:24.912
the Boscacci Habachi tango.

28:27.582 --> 28:28.813
I'm Xavier Boscacci

28:28.953 --> 28:30.370
and that's fun in the kitchen !

28:33.638 --> 28:35.180
Come on, people ! And that's...

28:35.569 --> 28:36.852
Fun in the kitchen.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.638
Fucking mall gigs !

28:42.136 --> 28:43.821
Okay, I need a volunteer, huh...

28:43.843 --> 28:45.419
How about you young lady ?

28:45.691 --> 28:46.652
No.

28:46.781 --> 28:49.129
Come on ! Let's give her
a little encouragement.

28:54.222 --> 28:55.259
Excuse me.

28:59.665 --> 29:00.392
Look, kid.

29:00.393 --> 29:02.753
I gotta move four of these by the
end of the hour or I'm a dead man.

29:02.852 --> 29:04.012
Right ? Just read the script.

29:12.174 --> 29:13.525
Do you like fresh fruit juice ?

29:16.228 --> 29:17.617
I love fresh fruit juice.

29:17.859 --> 29:18.935
Well, let me ask you this:

29:19.211 --> 29:20.223
Do you like the rind ?

29:23.262 --> 29:24.557
I throw the rind away.

29:25.098 --> 29:26.553
You throw the rind away ?

29:26.990 --> 29:29.639
My friend, if you're
not trying the rind,

29:30.843 --> 29:32.871
you're not living !

29:32.977 --> 29:34.467
Neither are you in 3 minutes.

29:36.829 --> 29:38.059
Oh ! Watch it, pal !

29:39.077 --> 29:41.971
Isn't fresh fruit juice expensive ?

29:42.836 --> 29:46.737
My friend, not only is the
kitchen guillotine easy to use

29:47.155 --> 29:50.484
and easy to clean,

29:52.134 --> 29:54.436
it's only $19.99 !

29:59.018 --> 30:02.737
And you too can have
fresh mimosas forever.

30:07.782 --> 30:10.021
And that's fun in the kitchen !

30:10.642 --> 30:11.927
You got some juice on your coat.

30:12.558 --> 30:14.301
Actually that's you.

30:15.728 --> 30:16.498
Oh...

30:16.499 --> 30:17.975
You got guillotined.

30:19.510 --> 30:20.944
I knew that blade wasn't safe.

30:21.488 --> 30:23.092
We're just trying to cut cost, you know.

30:23.545 --> 30:24.876
And the world gets even.

30:25.348 --> 30:27.457
And maybe even throws you a bone.

30:33.016 --> 30:36.632
So, is the rind really good for you ?

30:37.437 --> 30:38.380
I have no idea.

30:42.227 --> 30:43.417
That is not true, Joy.

30:44.067 --> 30:47.983
I'm sure of it. I bought that
table when you were in grad school

30:48.346 --> 30:49.425
Okay, whatever.

30:49.830 --> 30:50.796
Take it !

30:51.095 --> 30:53.361
Don't tell me like you're giving
me something out of charity.

30:53.446 --> 30:55.069
That was the agreement. I brought it in.

30:55.296 --> 30:56.375
Okay, fine.

30:56.479 --> 30:57.898
You know what I brought in ?

30:58.001 --> 30:58.919
Your necklace.

30:59.672 --> 31:00.643
My...

31:02.197 --> 31:03.730
Your mother gave this to me !

31:03.825 --> 31:04.650
My mother...

31:04.651 --> 31:07.989
I think that falls squarely in the category
of things that I brought into the marriage.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.584
She's my mother. You should
give the necklace back to me.

31:11.565 --> 31:12.742
Don't you get it ?

31:13.618 --> 31:15.311
I wanted to give this to...

31:17.186 --> 31:18.651
I want to give this to our daughter.

31:19.162 --> 31:21.347
Well, I can give it
to her just as easily.

31:22.035 --> 31:23.258
You want it, Clancy ?

31:24.089 --> 31:25.868
You're gonna have to
rip it off my neck !

31:29.041 --> 31:31.261
- Hi sweaty !
- Hey Regg' !

31:36.051 --> 31:37.322
How was school today, honey ?

31:43.711 --> 31:46.793
- Did I do one of these ?
- Yeah, you did. Right, Joy ?

31:48.682 --> 31:49.822
Where is it ?

31:50.012 --> 31:53.359
I don't know, sweaty. It
might have gone lost somewhere.

32:01.646 --> 32:03.391
I need a ride to my drums lesson...

32:03.626 --> 32:06.171
- Oh I'll take you !
- ...mum !

32:09.868 --> 32:12.518
Listen, do you mind if I stay
and go through some things ?

32:12.740 --> 32:13.805
I really do.

32:20.181 --> 32:22.146
Rube says the world wants balance...

32:22.576 --> 32:24.597
I say I'm ready to
help the world get it.

32:26.541 --> 32:27.821
Why shouldn't I get mine ?

32:28.727 --> 32:31.301
Even if I didn't exactly pay for it.

32:35.848 --> 32:36.911
Who are you kidding ?

32:37.326 --> 32:38.616
You're not this lucky.

32:41.279 --> 32:42.711
That's cool !

32:44.804 --> 32:46.520
Why should I play by the rules ?

32:46.871 --> 32:48.804
It's not like anyone was keeping score.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.010
And more important:

32:57.422 --> 32:59.298
it's not like anyone was watching.

33:26.257 --> 33:27.176
Hi there !

33:28.079 --> 33:28.999
Just browsing.

33:31.445 --> 33:35.576
I've got Jesus Christ,
Crystal, Twin Towers there.

33:37.499 --> 33:38.946
Tell me about the crosses.

33:39.543 --> 33:40.952
What would you like to know ?

33:41.168 --> 33:42.116
Are you a collector ?

33:42.867 --> 33:45.152
They just sort of have
a habit of turning up.

33:45.969 --> 33:47.268
You wanna see something pretty ?

34:12.572 --> 34:15.449
See ? Now there is
something really pretty !

34:17.828 --> 34:20.516
The crosses... How much are they worth ?

34:21.463 --> 34:23.042
- Depends.
- On ?

34:23.226 --> 34:26.995
Carat, age, design. Are you buying ?

34:27.110 --> 34:28.842
No, just information gathering for now.

34:28.940 --> 34:30.554
But I really do fancy them.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.549
It's a nice piece you've got on you.

34:34.386 --> 34:35.356
Is it ?

34:35.822 --> 34:36.993
- May I ?
- Yeah.

34:47.851 --> 34:48.897
Edwardian.

34:49.677 --> 34:51.100
Probably turn of the century.

34:53.027 --> 34:55.476
I'll give you a thousand bucks for it.

34:55.866 --> 34:56.744
Really ?

34:56.745 --> 35:00.051
I get a good turnover for
these heirloom state pieces.

35:00.117 --> 35:01.130
I don't think so.

35:01.897 --> 35:03.017
Are you catholic ?

35:03.507 --> 35:05.651
A little bit. So are you Rusty ?

35:05.805 --> 35:07.346
Yeah, I'm a little out of practice but

35:07.480 --> 35:09.452
you look like you
know what you're doing.

35:09.966 --> 35:11.437
Not even a chuckle ?

35:11.949 --> 35:13.218
Is Rusty your real name ?

35:13.891 --> 35:16.279
No, I had red hair when I was a kid.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.360
- My real name is John.
- John what ?

35:19.343 --> 35:20.334
John McCollum.

35:21.226 --> 35:23.614
1200. That's my final offer.

35:23.781 --> 35:24.764
No, thank you.

35:25.037 --> 35:27.061
I think I can get a
better deal somewhere else.

35:36.604 --> 35:38.775
You have beautiful things, Rusty.

35:39.392 --> 35:40.713
Rusty and beautiful.

35:41.309 --> 35:42.345
Rusty and beautiful...

36:00.965 --> 36:01.872
Take the mirror.

36:02.562 --> 36:05.667
- Really ?
- From one catholic to another.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.903
You know, I actually have plenty of
mirrors but I would love another cross.

36:11.231 --> 36:12.379
Help yourself.

36:15.244 --> 36:16.931
You're a sweet man, Rusty.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.293
I'm sure there's a nice deal
waiting out there for you.

36:30.698 --> 36:31.807
You don't eat the rind ?

36:32.333 --> 36:34.924
The rind is the best
part, darling. Look !

36:42.690 --> 36:44.548
That's fun in the kitchen !

36:45.155 --> 36:46.938
Alright, you know what ? You see, you...

36:47.098 --> 36:49.565
You are seriously beginning
to creep me out so piss off.

36:50.035 --> 36:52.223
Go on, I mean it. Piss off. Go !

36:52.513 --> 36:53.492
Go, go, go !

36:54.330 --> 36:57.145
Anyway, you lovely people, come
 and get your kitchen guillotine.

36:57.230 --> 36:59.020
It slices, it dices.

36:59.052 --> 37:01.066
It'll cut your fucking
hand off if you want it to.

37:01.290 --> 37:03.735
Only 10 bucks a pop.
Lovely ! Thank you !

37:03.910 --> 37:06.054
Be the first on your
block ! I'm good at this !

37:06.278 --> 37:08.563
Lovely ! There's your
kitchen guillotine, sir !

37:13.918 --> 37:15.415
A day of firsts.

37:15.854 --> 37:18.850
First time you've pulled into
this driveway since you died.

37:19.358 --> 37:21.717
First time you walk
in without breaking in.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.675
And maybe the last
time you see the place.

37:24.818 --> 37:25.780
Hi !

37:25.812 --> 37:27.685
- You must be Millie.
- Hi.

37:28.530 --> 37:29.538
Nice to meet you.

37:30.203 --> 37:33.713
I have to say it's a real coup when a
house on this block comes out for sale.

37:33.964 --> 37:36.408
Those people keep these
gems in the family for years.

37:36.485 --> 37:37.866
It's a very special opportunity.

37:37.966 --> 37:40.107
And you're sure the family
won't be here, right ?

37:40.238 --> 37:41.890
Oh no. No, of course not.

37:42.266 --> 37:43.465
No, I think it's kind of...

37:43.977 --> 37:44.892
I don't know...

37:44.893 --> 37:48.200
creepy having the family hovering
around when you look at their things.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.529
Creepy might be too strong a word.

37:50.679 --> 37:51.738
No, it's good.

37:52.563 --> 37:54.466
So, you are single ?

37:54.702 --> 37:55.658
Engaged.

37:55.912 --> 37:59.225
To a banker. He's at the
bank making serious... bank.

38:00.049 --> 38:03.197
- Sure, then financing...
- Is the least of our problems.

38:03.676 --> 38:08.200
Well, I think it's nice that the two of you
are interested in a family home like this.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.858
Preparing for the future.

38:10.040 --> 38:13.557
What I was really doing, of
course, was facing my past.

38:15.730 --> 38:20.988
Now, what's special about the design of
the interior of this home is the floor.

38:23.610 --> 38:26.567
- Why are they moving ?
- Excuse me ?

38:27.735 --> 38:30.596
- Where is the family going ?
- I wouldn't know that.

38:31.183 --> 38:34.045
Well, why are they leaving ?

38:34.137 --> 38:37.461
There's no problem with the house
itself. I can assure you of that.

38:37.748 --> 38:40.709
No, this place has been
perfectly maintained.

38:41.081 --> 38:42.002
The mother is...

38:44.033 --> 38:46.408
Well she's very particular.

38:50.401 --> 38:52.990
It just doesn't make any sense.

38:53.216 --> 38:54.176
Now...

38:55.171 --> 38:56.732
I shouldn't tell you this but

38:57.315 --> 38:58.616
they lost a child.

38:58.924 --> 39:00.908
It was very sad. Terrible accident.

39:01.293 --> 39:02.520
Not in the home of course.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.555
But I think that was
the beginning of it.

39:04.849 --> 39:05.953
The beginning of what ?

39:06.844 --> 39:08.076
The end of the marriage.

39:08.421 --> 39:09.379
It's very common.

39:09.568 --> 39:11.944
Most marriages can't
survive the death of a child.

39:12.579 --> 39:14.585
I do love those stores though.

39:17.572 --> 39:21.610
And just as I did as a child when faced
with something I didn't wanna hear,

39:22.179 --> 39:24.212
I headed straight for my room.

39:24.725 --> 39:27.198
Can I show you one of the bedrooms in ?

39:28.245 --> 39:30.417
There's a tricky handle,
you might wanna...

39:31.618 --> 39:32.621
hit it a bit.

39:33.468 --> 39:37.773
It's the silly real flaw on an otherwise
mint-conditioned house. I assure you.

39:38.448 --> 39:40.927
I think I'd just like to
get a feel for it up here.

39:41.576 --> 39:42.800
By myself.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.034
Sure, I'll be downstairs.

39:48.114 --> 39:50.166
But it wasn't even my room anymore.

39:50.858 --> 39:52.762
My parents were getting a divorce.

39:53.444 --> 39:55.566
And I didn't even had a bed to cry on.

39:57.372 --> 39:59.241
What is it about the death of something

39:59.287 --> 40:01.911
that makes people just
wanna put it in a box ?

40:06.453 --> 40:09.025
And finally there I was.

40:16.603 --> 40:18.264
But there was no place for me.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.091
I just didn't fit.

40:27.061 --> 40:28.603
Did Millie ever come back ?

40:28.780 --> 40:31.204
I wanted her to do this tonight.

40:32.083 --> 40:34.034
Just don't sing "We
are the world" again.

40:34.195 --> 40:37.187
for one-apple martini in units 1983.

40:37.715 --> 40:40.857
Dolores ! You wanna come to
the Karaoke Happy Hour with us ?

40:41.151 --> 40:43.248
I can't I've got responsibilities.

40:43.458 --> 40:45.504
Come on, Dolores !
Everyone's gonna be there !

40:57.524 --> 40:59.113
Well, back to the salt mine.

41:09.996 --> 41:11.437
Rock star parking.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.260
Lucky me.

41:32.726 --> 41:34.513
- What's that ?
- A Mustang.

41:34.819 --> 41:37.248
Temps must be doing really
well on this new economy.

41:38.825 --> 41:39.756
You steal it ?

41:40.050 --> 41:41.048
Not exactly.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.031
Did you buy it ?

41:43.937 --> 41:45.202
Not exactly.

41:45.680 --> 41:46.963
How did you get it exactly ?

41:47.875 --> 41:49.450
I think I was supposed to get it.

41:49.752 --> 41:51.444
That whole balance thing.

41:55.383 --> 41:57.323
I had a really bad day, Rube.

42:01.715 --> 42:03.612
I think I was supposed to get it.

42:05.770 --> 42:06.755
Okay.

42:07.398 --> 42:09.100
I've seen this kid today, this morning,

42:09.596 --> 42:10.559
who was picked.

42:11.084 --> 42:12.118
19 years old.

42:13.187 --> 42:15.298
Stole $17, was killed running away.

42:15.751 --> 42:18.522
Not a bad guy, never
stole anything in his life.

42:18.596 --> 42:19.533
Just hungry.

42:19.789 --> 42:22.310
He's 19. you were 18.

42:22.958 --> 42:24.664
What else did it say about me ?

42:24.971 --> 42:27.533
On the list before you wrote
my name on that post-it.

42:30.254 --> 42:33.188
It said that you did not
have a driver's license.

42:35.778 --> 42:38.275
And you didn't get that car
because someone stole your bike.

42:41.000 --> 42:41.941
What happened today ?

42:42.961 --> 42:44.873
My parents are getting a divorce.

42:46.127 --> 42:48.152
Looking to blame someone for that ?

42:48.525 --> 42:49.512
I don't know.

42:51.396 --> 42:52.301
Sweetheart...

42:53.052 --> 42:53.988
My experience...

42:55.575 --> 42:57.440
Death of a child
doesn't kill a marriage.

42:59.006 --> 43:01.252
Sometimes it gives it
an overdue barrier but

43:01.792 --> 43:03.451
you can blame yourself if you want to.

43:04.919 --> 43:07.072
That young lady would be unfair.

43:10.869 --> 43:11.783
See you tomorrow ?

43:19.394 --> 43:20.355
Do me a favor.

43:20.746 --> 43:23.032
Bring my friend a bowl
of chocolate ice cream.

43:43.096 --> 43:44.467
Tonight, somewhere else,

43:44.538 --> 43:46.880
maybe there's a different
girl who's dodging a bullet

43:47.049 --> 43:49.452
or stepping out of the
path of a speeding train.

43:49.558 --> 43:50.571
A girl who's lucky.

43:51.294 --> 43:52.204
I don't know...

43:57.287 --> 44:01.500
I figured that since I had a pretty
harsh stretch of bad luck when I was 18,

44:01.944 --> 44:07.194
you know, the whole toilet seat falling from
the sky and incinerating me kind of bad luck,

44:07.742 --> 44:12.547
I figured it would be reasonable to expect
a change of fortune on the other side.

44:23.532 --> 44:25.499
Why shouldn't I get
the books to balance ?

44:27.950 --> 44:29.917
Why shouldn't I make things add up ?

44:40.990 --> 44:43.388
I'm tired of playing by the rules.

44:44.002 --> 44:45.301
I wanna be bad.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.027
I wanna have fun.

44:48.750 --> 44:53.066
I want to keep stealing back pieces
from where my life used to be.

44:55.835 --> 44:57.501
I'm just like everyone else.

44:58.975 --> 45:01.037
And I'm ready to even the score.

45:02.305 --> 45:08.613
