00:01.231 --> 00:02.619
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.649 --> 00:05.004
If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.034 --> 00:06.333
you will all fall,

00:06.335 --> 00:07.502
one by friend,

00:07.532 --> 00:09.336
one by foe, and one

00:09.338 --> 00:10.537
by a family.

00:11.874 --> 00:13.474
Till death do us part.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.542
My husband died...

00:16.328 --> 00:17.828
Because he loved me.

00:17.830 --> 00:20.330
Davina is in over her
head, and Aya knows this.

00:20.332 --> 00:22.438
She will let Davina
desire both brothers,

00:22.468 --> 00:25.252
then test the spell's success
by firing a white oak bullet

00:25.254 --> 00:27.304
into Klaus's heart.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.590
My sire line is broken.

00:30.592 --> 00:32.058
Please, Nik, just kill me!

00:32.061 --> 00:34.300
Behinds walls is where you belong.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.101
Just know,

00:35.131 --> 00:36.485
it was I

00:36.515 --> 00:39.035
who took everything from you.

00:40.502 --> 00:41.407
What's wrong with me?

00:41.437 --> 00:44.554
You hemorrhaged an enormous
amount of mystical energy...

00:44.556 --> 00:46.556
Enough to create a nexus vorti.

00:46.558 --> 00:47.858
Where did the energy go?

00:47.860 --> 00:49.226
The blood of two brothers,

00:49.228 --> 00:50.727
the ash of their dead.

00:54.937 --> 00:58.525
I never doubted you for
a second, Davina Claire.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.824 --> 01:20.346
You collect trophies

01:20.376 --> 01:21.742
from all your victims?

01:21.744 --> 01:23.862
Letters to their loved
ones, to be specific.

01:23.892 --> 01:24.890
It was a phase.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.269
A phase in which we were forced

01:26.299 --> 01:28.294
to learn a different kind of stealth.

01:28.324 --> 01:30.206
You see, over time,
Niklaus's enemies grew

01:30.236 --> 01:31.858
so numerous, we had no choice

01:31.888 --> 01:35.058
but to artfully withdraw from the world.

01:35.272 --> 01:36.556
And then...

01:37.762 --> 01:39.014
Well, I wouldn't exactly describe

01:39.044 --> 01:41.116
our presence in this city as discreet,

01:41.146 --> 01:42.229
wouldn't you agree, Niklaus?

01:42.231 --> 01:43.219
We all saw

01:43.249 --> 01:44.665
the white oak destroyed.

01:45.310 --> 01:46.238
Plus, this city

01:46.268 --> 01:48.390
was crawling with vampires,
all of whom had no choice

01:48.420 --> 01:50.242
but to shield me from potential foes.

01:50.272 --> 01:51.521
Were I to die, they would die, too.

01:51.551 --> 01:53.601
I couldn't have been more safe.

01:54.013 --> 01:55.809
And now my sire link is undone,

01:56.561 --> 01:57.327
and those very foes

01:57.357 --> 01:59.774
will come for me like never before.

01:59.804 --> 02:02.366
It's only been a few days
since the link was broken.

02:02.396 --> 02:04.807
Must you jump into
crippling paranoia already?

02:04.837 --> 02:05.992
It's a default setting.

02:06.022 --> 02:07.476
And with good reason.

02:07.506 --> 02:09.878
Well, Niklaus, if it offers
you any solace whatsoever,

02:09.908 --> 02:11.125
we've ransacked Aya's belongings,

02:11.127 --> 02:12.710
torched Aurora's hunting ground,

02:12.712 --> 02:15.245
and obliterated every last
splinter of the white oak.

02:15.708 --> 02:18.386
I would be mad to believe that.

02:18.416 --> 02:20.666
Perhaps you should see a therapist.

02:30.676 --> 02:32.682
Every last splinter?

02:33.717 --> 02:35.274
You're sure?

02:35.633 --> 02:40.279
== sync & corrections by Wolfhound ==
== www.addic7ed.com ==

02:43.543 --> 02:44.280
Whew.

02:44.310 --> 02:45.809
Come on, now, defense.

02:45.811 --> 02:48.000
- Keep your hands up.
- Up?

02:48.230 --> 02:50.197
I'm at least a foot taller than Aurora.

02:50.199 --> 02:51.865
Not that that'll stop
her from kicking my ass!

02:53.123 --> 02:54.544
Aurora?

02:54.574 --> 02:55.836
I thought Klaus took care of her.

02:56.191 --> 02:57.838
According to Hayley,
he said he condemned her

02:57.840 --> 02:59.411
to a fate worse than death.

02:59.441 --> 03:01.108
Translation: not dead.

03:01.110 --> 03:03.446
Which means, sooner or later,

03:03.476 --> 03:05.145
I'm screwed.

03:05.147 --> 03:08.949
She turned me, thinking it would
make Klaus run back to her arms.

03:08.951 --> 03:11.485
It didn't, so once she gets out,

03:11.487 --> 03:13.701
wherever she is, ripping my heart out

03:13.731 --> 03:16.183
will be number one on her to-do list!

03:16.449 --> 03:18.458
Whoa there.

03:23.132 --> 03:25.132
I figured he'd rip her head off.

03:25.134 --> 03:27.188
He didn't.

03:29.719 --> 03:31.557
So are you scared that
she's gonna come for you

03:31.587 --> 03:34.044
or that there's a reason
that Klaus didn't kill her?

03:37.763 --> 03:39.819
Or we can not talk and

03:39.849 --> 03:41.120
keep hitting things.

03:42.441 --> 03:44.348
I'd prefer we use our words.

03:47.989 --> 03:51.116
I have a few matters I wish
to discuss with Camille.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.390
Matters of a personal nature.

03:54.419 --> 03:55.642
To be discussed

03:55.644 --> 03:58.894
within appropriate professional
boundaries, of course.

03:59.943 --> 04:01.315
Shall we?

04:14.580 --> 04:16.380
You've been asleep for three days.

04:16.582 --> 04:19.249
Regenerating from ash
takes a lot out of a man.

04:23.505 --> 04:26.845
You have no idea how badly
I want to kiss you right now.

04:27.495 --> 04:29.216
So what's stopping you?

04:30.056 --> 04:32.212
Well, I can take the heat...

04:35.444 --> 04:37.274
If it means I get to kiss you,

04:37.304 --> 04:38.518
but letting the church burn down

04:38.520 --> 04:40.738
to ashes may be considered sacrilegious.

04:40.768 --> 04:42.428
But y-you were a witch.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.580
The spell you used
brought me back as I was

04:44.610 --> 04:46.767
when I died in this body.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.730
Kol, I've heard the stories.

04:51.152 --> 04:52.287
When you were a vampire, you were...

04:52.317 --> 04:54.818
A psychotic maniac.

04:56.411 --> 04:58.327
But I didn't have you.

04:58.357 --> 05:00.474
You're worth being good for.

05:02.449 --> 05:05.028
I promise you can trust me.

05:18.266 --> 05:20.339
At the risk of sounding too forward,

05:20.369 --> 05:22.501
I need you to put a ring on this finger.

05:23.499 --> 05:25.615
A family reunion is in order.

05:27.671 --> 05:29.763
Kol, about your family...

05:32.213 --> 05:34.624
I'm pretty sure Klaus wants me dead.

05:42.615 --> 05:43.725
Morning.

05:45.719 --> 05:48.280
O-negative and tequila.

05:48.310 --> 05:50.857
For when you wake up all kinds of wrong.

05:51.627 --> 05:53.989
Looks like I missed one hell of a party.

05:54.019 --> 05:56.113
At my loft.

05:56.115 --> 05:58.554
It's not every night
you get to celebrate

05:58.584 --> 06:00.739
having your supernatural
link to a murderous psycho

06:00.769 --> 06:02.934
broken by a blood spell.

06:02.964 --> 06:05.188
- He said without irony.
- Yeah, well, it wasn't

06:05.190 --> 06:06.628
a party at Strix HQ.

06:06.658 --> 06:07.663
We might be free of Klaus,

06:07.693 --> 06:10.031
- but they are still linked to Elijah.
- Hmm.

06:10.061 --> 06:12.248
How long do we have to
care about the Strix?

06:12.278 --> 06:13.702
You've played undercover leader.

06:13.732 --> 06:16.182
Why can't you just Pied Piper
them the hell out of town?

06:16.184 --> 06:17.689
The Strix are thinning out.

06:17.719 --> 06:20.225
It is back to Nola business as usual.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.366
I'm afraid our plans to
vacate have been put on hold.

06:24.016 --> 06:26.591
Three of our upper-level
circle are missing,

06:26.621 --> 06:28.245
including Fukuda, Bailey and Flynn.

06:28.526 --> 06:31.469
In the wake of Aya's death,
you can understand our concern,

06:31.499 --> 06:33.583
though you don't seem to share it.

06:35.951 --> 06:36.942
Tell me.

06:36.972 --> 06:38.305
How do the Strix punish

06:38.335 --> 06:41.027
insubordination, hmm?

06:42.394 --> 06:44.227
Or should we check the charter?

06:45.894 --> 06:49.149
All right, then, let's go see if
we can find our missing friends.

06:59.026 --> 06:59.994
Thought you were in the bayou.

07:00.024 --> 07:01.024
Shh.

07:01.863 --> 07:04.997
I just came home to feed
Hope, put her down for a nap.

07:05.027 --> 07:06.114
I'm heading back out soon.

07:06.144 --> 07:07.144
Stop.

07:07.866 --> 07:09.300
What is this?

07:10.864 --> 07:12.160
Nothing.

07:12.190 --> 07:15.191
I just got caught on a thorn.

07:15.888 --> 07:18.327
You've been spending a lot of
time with the Crescents lately.

07:18.542 --> 07:22.546
Oh, they need me, ever since Jackson...

07:26.709 --> 07:27.971
Do you need something, Elijah?

07:28.001 --> 07:29.856
I came to check on Hope.

07:29.858 --> 07:32.192
Niklaus is a little overwhelmed
with everything.

07:32.194 --> 07:34.450
Well, maybe he's right
in being paranoid.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.696
Seems like every time we
pause to catch our breath,

07:36.698 --> 07:38.824
someone ends up dead.

07:39.494 --> 07:41.218
She'll be asleep for another hour.

07:41.954 --> 07:43.437
- Do you mind?
- Of course not.

07:43.853 --> 07:45.231
Thank you.

07:58.316 --> 08:00.297
You can't prove all of the
white oak was destroyed,

08:00.327 --> 08:01.739
and you can't live in fear of something

08:01.741 --> 08:03.876
that might not even be there.

08:07.341 --> 08:09.624
I despise feeling so helpless.

08:11.076 --> 08:12.107
A few decades ago,

08:12.137 --> 08:14.104
in the midst of his
incessant pursuit of me,

08:14.106 --> 08:16.973
Mikael disappeared without a trace.

08:16.975 --> 08:18.725
No witch could locate him.

08:18.727 --> 08:21.800
Of course, I lived as though
he lurked around every corner,

08:21.830 --> 08:24.831
until one day, I, too, disappeared.

08:25.021 --> 08:28.010
Just cut all ties and vanished.

08:28.223 --> 08:29.502
And Elijah?

08:29.504 --> 08:32.087
I told him I disposed
of our siblings' bodies.

08:32.090 --> 08:36.009
To call it an estrangement would
be a bit of an understatement.

08:37.679 --> 08:41.765
But you don't want to be that man again.

08:43.196 --> 08:45.726
I have more to lose now.

08:47.102 --> 08:49.169
I can't be your therapist anymore.

08:50.699 --> 08:53.528
Are you afraid vampirism
makes you less astute?

08:53.558 --> 08:54.384
Because, honestly...

08:54.414 --> 08:56.465
I can't counsel you to
let go of your paranoia

08:56.495 --> 08:58.493
when I have issues of my own.

08:59.817 --> 09:01.831
You left Aurora alive.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.089
She compelled me to slit my
throat, and you let her live.

09:04.119 --> 09:05.619
In unending torment.

09:05.621 --> 09:06.820
Camille, you are the reason

09:06.850 --> 09:09.206
I will not grant her the
mercy of a quick death!

09:10.250 --> 09:12.422
She has to suffer

09:12.452 --> 09:14.328
for what she stole from you.

09:15.084 --> 09:17.434
I'm okay with who I am now, Klaus.

09:18.050 --> 09:21.024
I think you're more concerned
about what she stole from you.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.604
It was him. It was Gaspar Cortez.

09:50.634 --> 09:53.375
I assume this is someone
from your box of letters.

09:53.405 --> 09:55.035
The youngest son of a
particularly vile family

09:55.037 --> 09:57.759
of warlords I dealt
with in the 17th century.

09:57.789 --> 10:00.039
Didn't they burn that philistine
pigsty into the ground?

10:00.041 --> 10:01.377
Pigsty?

10:01.727 --> 10:03.918
Belaga was my favorite artist retreat.

10:03.948 --> 10:05.801
Someone had to pay
for that, so I murdered

10:05.831 --> 10:07.793
Gaspar's brute of a father.

10:07.823 --> 10:10.105
- And?
- And one or two...

10:10.135 --> 10:12.919
- Five.
- Five of his bloodthirsty brothers.

10:12.921 --> 10:14.971
- Don't forget the mistress.
- That was an accident!

10:14.973 --> 10:16.973
The point is that Gaspar
was but a footnote.

10:16.975 --> 10:22.149
Until he became a vampire,
hell-bent on hunting me.

10:27.398 --> 10:29.319
Thank you.

10:29.321 --> 10:32.439
See to it my friends are
taken care of, won't you?

10:35.527 --> 10:38.283
He's a cunning deviant, known
to compel hoards of the helpless

10:38.313 --> 10:40.239
to aid him with his tasks.

10:45.203 --> 10:49.001
You see, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.815
Devils of all kinds,

10:53.845 --> 10:57.728
crawling out of their
crevices to strike at me.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.058
Speaking of which.

11:06.391 --> 11:09.275
Rather foolish of you
to come here alone.

11:15.070 --> 11:18.635
She didn't come alone, brother.

11:24.940 --> 11:27.988
Now, Nik, I mean, you
did go after my girl.

11:28.275 --> 11:30.351
- It can't be.
- It's Kol.

11:30.353 --> 11:33.159
When I broke your sire link,
it created a surge of power.

11:33.189 --> 11:34.939
You stole the nexus vorti.

11:34.941 --> 11:36.621
And brought your brother
back from the dead.

11:36.651 --> 11:39.494
You should be thanking her, really.

11:58.414 --> 12:00.945
Hello, Elijah.

12:00.975 --> 12:02.967
You haven't aged a day.

12:06.084 --> 12:08.093
And you.

12:08.123 --> 12:10.157
Freya.

12:10.359 --> 12:11.632
Right.

12:11.662 --> 12:13.894
Long-lost older sister.

12:13.924 --> 12:15.919
Speaking of twists and
turns in our family tree,

12:15.949 --> 12:18.096
where might Rebekah be?

12:18.126 --> 12:20.084
That's a long story.

12:20.386 --> 12:22.142
And one reserved for family.

12:22.172 --> 12:24.549
- Davina can see herself out.
- Uh, are you...?

12:24.579 --> 12:27.614
As per usual, our family
faces a multitude of threats.

12:27.644 --> 12:30.016
The sooner you become
acquainted with them, the better.

12:30.046 --> 12:32.919
- I won't have you distracted.
- By Davina?

12:32.949 --> 12:34.419
You know, if you could only
pull your head out of your...

12:34.449 --> 12:36.519
Kol.

12:36.549 --> 12:39.036
It's okay. I'll go.

12:39.066 --> 12:41.397
Davina.

12:44.043 --> 12:45.405
You can make it up to me.

12:45.435 --> 12:47.410
And I will.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.297
Dust off that fancy dress.

12:49.299 --> 12:51.053
'Cause tonight we're going dancing.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.551
Okay.

13:10.820 --> 13:14.611
I'd offer you a drink, but
I see you helped yourself.

13:14.641 --> 13:17.113
I'll leave a generous tip.

13:17.143 --> 13:18.581
A favor.

13:18.611 --> 13:20.778
I need to make absolutely certain

13:20.780 --> 13:22.784
that not a splinter of
that white oak remains.

13:22.814 --> 13:24.001
Get your best men on it.

13:24.035 --> 13:26.122
That's not gonna happen. My best men...

13:26.152 --> 13:29.570
Fukuda, Bailey... M.I.A.,
as of three hours ago.

13:29.572 --> 13:31.906
And I get the impression
that ordering the Strix to do

13:31.908 --> 13:33.408
anything other than
find their missing men

13:33.410 --> 13:35.615
would be, uh, very bad for my health.

13:35.645 --> 13:37.362
It's very bad for everyone's health.

13:37.364 --> 13:38.473
Do you have any leads?

13:38.503 --> 13:41.149
Mm, the city's full of
people who want the Strix out.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.411
For good reason.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.419
Bring them the head of the culprit

13:47.449 --> 13:51.375
before they burn this
city into the ground.

14:03.389 --> 14:04.839
Are you Vincent Griffith?

14:04.869 --> 14:06.146
Hey.

14:06.176 --> 14:09.049
I've been looking for you.

14:10.591 --> 14:12.736
_

14:12.766 --> 14:14.793
"Immediately"?

14:15.167 --> 14:17.330
Who gave you this?

14:17.787 --> 14:19.125
Look, man, I ain't
going with you nowhere

14:19.155 --> 14:21.789
until you tell me
what this is all about.

14:25.015 --> 14:26.500
No!

14:41.778 --> 14:44.901
Well, isn't this the welcome home.

14:44.931 --> 14:47.503
Already at the mercy of
Niklaus, and just in time

14:47.533 --> 14:50.135
to help the rest of us 
clean up his mess.

14:50.684 --> 14:52.858
Do you miss being dead yet?

14:52.888 --> 14:54.244
Keep up your ceaseless whining,

14:54.274 --> 14:56.345
and I'm sure he will.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.208
Here.

14:59.011 --> 15:02.012
I compelled the housekeeper.

15:02.949 --> 15:05.066
Next time, a blood bag will be fine.

15:05.068 --> 15:07.707
I'm meant to be off the fresh stuff.

15:07.737 --> 15:10.843
Attempting to be a better
man for your girlfriend?

15:10.873 --> 15:12.824
I'd rather be with that girlfriend,

15:12.826 --> 15:16.194
but since your enemies have
returned seeking vengeance,

15:16.196 --> 15:17.695
I suppose they ought to be murdered.

15:17.697 --> 15:19.414
So remind me, who is this Cortez?

15:19.416 --> 15:21.366
His family decimated Belaga.

15:21.368 --> 15:24.573
Ugh! Belaga. That place was hideous.

15:24.603 --> 15:26.879
- Thank you, Kol.
- No taste.

15:26.909 --> 15:27.939
Either of you.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.913
All right, calm down.

15:29.943 --> 15:32.082
I know exactly how to find your enemies.

15:32.112 --> 15:33.595
As long as our new
sister doesn't chafe at me

15:33.625 --> 15:35.702
for teaching her a quick spell.

15:35.732 --> 15:37.766
Mind if I burn these?

15:58.387 --> 16:01.660
I prefer utter silence when I eat.

16:01.974 --> 16:04.191
Helps me to think.

16:04.693 --> 16:08.184
And I think you must
be Vincent Griffith...

16:08.364 --> 16:10.364
Regent of New Orleans.

16:11.066 --> 16:12.226
And you must be the psycho

16:12.260 --> 16:14.974
who compelled somebody
to die in my arms.

16:15.004 --> 16:17.788
See, that sort of thing
ain't gonna fly in my city.

16:18.658 --> 16:21.442
I'm really gonna enjoy killing you.

16:28.935 --> 16:31.649
I knew you'd be difficult.

16:31.679 --> 16:34.872
That's why I compelled these men
to murder their fellow patrons.

16:35.374 --> 16:38.989
You can see how this could
become a bloodbath, yes?

16:39.019 --> 16:40.377
Yeah.

16:40.479 --> 16:42.730
What do you want?

16:43.232 --> 16:45.466
I'm looking for something
that was lost in this city,

16:45.496 --> 16:48.557
and I bet your witch
ancestors know where it is.

16:48.587 --> 16:50.053
Since you are the regent,

16:50.055 --> 16:53.477
you're gonna ask them to find it for me.

16:59.891 --> 17:03.171
No one saw her taken?
Go to all their hotels,

17:03.201 --> 17:04.334
grab their things.

17:04.364 --> 17:06.991
No one travels alone!

17:07.021 --> 17:09.761
FYI, there's a girl still
asleep on your bathroom floor.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.125
Couldn't bring myself to wake her; 
she looks so peaceful.

17:12.377 --> 17:15.011
Josh, another Strix
member has gone missing,

17:15.012 --> 17:16.818
and I need a favor from Davina.

17:16.848 --> 17:19.921
Now, I'm not exactly her
favorite person right now, so...

17:19.951 --> 17:21.759
Is it a favor for you or the Strix?

17:21.789 --> 17:24.203
- It's not that simple.
- Uh-huh.

17:24.204 --> 17:26.571
Look, I know you had
your reasons for joining,

17:26.574 --> 17:28.202
but, no offense, I'm starting to think

17:28.232 --> 17:30.409
you're not undercover anymore.

17:30.577 --> 17:33.151
Kind of feels like you're just... in it.

17:33.181 --> 17:35.204
Well, once you're in, the
only way out of the Strix

17:35.234 --> 17:39.947
is to die, so I can't just walk away.

17:40.544 --> 17:43.323
You gonna help me or not?

17:46.995 --> 17:48.160
For the record, I'm only doing

17:48.162 --> 17:50.068
the locator spell because you asked.

17:50.098 --> 17:51.322
Look, I know Marcel's been

17:51.352 --> 17:53.430
a total absentee dad lately, but...

17:53.460 --> 17:55.406
He always comes through in the end.

17:55.436 --> 17:57.695
I hope.

17:58.398 --> 17:59.773
Whoa.

17:59.803 --> 18:01.645
Hot date tonight?

18:01.675 --> 18:04.589
If he shows up.

18:05.378 --> 18:07.421
Kol spent the day with his family.

18:07.765 --> 18:09.441
He's a vampire again.

18:09.471 --> 18:11.523
An Original vampire.

18:11.553 --> 18:13.242
I think when he was dead,
it was easy to forget

18:13.272 --> 18:15.188
that he was a Mikaelson, but...

18:15.740 --> 18:18.927
Watching him and the way
he fits in with all of them,

18:19.475 --> 18:20.839
it's... it's pretty weird.

18:20.869 --> 18:23.279
Well, hey, if I learned
anything in the last year,

18:23.281 --> 18:27.116
doesn't matter what he is,
it only matters who he is.

18:28.253 --> 18:31.588
So... who is he?

18:34.259 --> 18:37.427
I'm still figuring that out.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.684
Well...

18:51.714 --> 18:54.244
Good news is I found Marcel's friends.

18:54.246 --> 18:56.616
The bad news is they're dead.

18:57.782 --> 19:00.450
Mixing the ashes of these
letters with your blood, Nik,

19:00.452 --> 19:03.002
will show us where your enemies are.

19:24.309 --> 19:26.309
With feeling now.

19:49.702 --> 19:52.049
Behold your greatest hits, Klaus.

19:53.652 --> 19:55.658
All over the world.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.327
But only one is here.

19:58.329 --> 20:01.163
Which means the legion of
enemies you were worried about

20:01.165 --> 20:03.616
is an army of one.

20:12.622 --> 20:13.945
Jamie?

20:15.198 --> 20:16.557
Jamie!

20:21.269 --> 20:22.645
What the...?

20:23.669 --> 20:26.656
Disturbing him would end
very badly for everyone here.

20:26.898 --> 20:29.923
I take it you're the guy
behind the mess at the gym.

20:33.330 --> 20:34.707
You're a vampire.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.571
Well, maybe I can't compel you,

20:37.601 --> 20:40.601
but I have other ways to
make you do what I want.

20:42.874 --> 20:44.439
Those men don't want
to kill their friends.

20:44.469 --> 20:47.015
If you behave, they won't have to.

20:53.467 --> 20:54.717
Leave her out of this.

20:54.719 --> 20:55.935
I'll gladly release you both

20:55.937 --> 20:56.904
once you find what I'm looking for.

20:56.934 --> 20:58.210
I will find you the white oak, man.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.639
Just leave her alone.

21:04.279 --> 21:06.062
Um...

21:06.748 --> 21:09.782
I assure you, this
is your Gaspar Cortez.

21:12.983 --> 21:14.929
_

21:26.685 --> 21:27.934
Did you see the white oak?

21:27.964 --> 21:28.840
Aurora had it

21:28.870 --> 21:31.280
but the ancestors aren't saying where.

21:31.985 --> 21:34.116
But it exists.

21:35.871 --> 21:36.718
Look, man,

21:36.748 --> 21:38.871
they are not going to help you.

21:39.726 --> 21:41.755
Ask them again.

21:42.514 --> 21:46.952
This time, I strongly suggest
you don't take no for an answer.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.239
L'objet que perdu

21:56.269 --> 22:00.192
est petis in civitate...

22:04.188 --> 22:05.918
Went to the wrong dumpster.

22:05.948 --> 22:08.565
Of course, I have nothing better to do.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.514
Davina found our missing Strix.

22:16.341 --> 22:18.284
Wolf bites.

22:18.575 --> 22:21.542
They were tortured and then torn apart.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.760
Elijah,

22:23.168 --> 22:26.575
Jackson was killed just
around the corner from here.

22:29.508 --> 22:33.165
The Strix are still gonna want
the head of whoever did this.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.420
Burn the bodies.

22:57.392 --> 22:59.392
Hayley!

22:59.594 --> 23:01.210
What do you think you're doing?

23:07.018 --> 23:08.935
L'objet perdu que petis

23:08.937 --> 23:12.388
est in civitate, in qua non dico.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.475
L'objet que petis in civitate...

23:16.032 --> 23:17.894
L'objet que...

23:18.180 --> 23:19.312
Que...

23:20.899 --> 23:22.298
You're not gonna get what
you want if he's dead.

23:22.328 --> 23:25.157
Shut up. Vincent, I grow impatient.

23:25.187 --> 23:27.069
Where is the white oak?

23:33.545 --> 23:35.128
Cortez!

23:38.198 --> 23:40.466
Welcome to New Orleans.

23:41.266 --> 23:43.052
Long time no see.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.380
You've come all this
way. You must be tired.

23:45.410 --> 23:49.175
Please, allow me the courtesy
of putting you to rest.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.177
Klaus...

23:50.573 --> 23:51.394
Make a move,

23:51.396 --> 23:53.763
Niklaus, and everyone here will die.

23:54.585 --> 23:55.585
Or...

23:55.957 --> 23:57.192
You can wait for us all to learn

23:57.222 --> 23:59.101
the whereabouts of the white oak.

23:59.103 --> 24:00.987
Choice is yours.

24:00.989 --> 24:04.690
Either way, I win.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.592
So here's how this works.

24:14.656 --> 24:16.056
Everyone lives...

24:16.859 --> 24:18.647
once you let me leave.

24:18.677 --> 24:21.344
So you expect me to let you live,

24:21.346 --> 24:23.496
knowing you seek white oak?

24:25.216 --> 24:29.257
It's a shame how some
vampires grow so dim with age.

24:29.972 --> 24:32.222
Killing you will be a mercy.

24:32.224 --> 24:33.628
Kill me, and this quaint eatery

24:33.658 --> 24:34.975
turns into a slaughterhouse,

24:34.977 --> 24:36.309
shining a light

24:36.311 --> 24:38.478
on your town's more
repulsive activities.

24:40.336 --> 24:41.386
You know...

24:43.819 --> 24:46.987
I really liked Belaga.

24:46.989 --> 24:47.988
Klaus...

24:48.490 --> 24:49.490
No!

24:55.380 --> 24:57.213
No. No, no.

24:59.484 --> 25:01.054
You'll be okay. Just drink this.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.244
It won't help.

25:02.274 --> 25:03.786
Come on.

25:04.132 --> 25:05.132
Camille!

25:39.191 --> 25:40.539
This has to stop!

25:40.569 --> 25:43.055
Why are you defending
these people, Elijah?

25:43.085 --> 25:44.394
Oh, that's right, because they're

25:44.396 --> 25:46.811
the only ones that can
protect you from the white oak.

25:46.841 --> 25:50.053
Well, guess what, I don't
need their protection.

25:52.392 --> 25:53.737
This is a list.

25:54.255 --> 25:57.077
Of all the Strix who took
down me and my husband.

25:57.107 --> 25:58.241
The ones responsible

25:58.243 --> 26:00.961
for his execution, which
I was forced to watch.

26:00.963 --> 26:03.540
The Strix will consider this
is as an act of war, Hayley.

26:03.570 --> 26:06.333
Now, I beseech you to
think of your daughter.

26:07.964 --> 26:11.640
Do not use Hope in an
attempt to tame me, Elijah.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.769
Now, I have taken risks for you.

26:13.799 --> 26:16.099
It is about time that
I do right by Jackson.

26:16.129 --> 26:19.199
I'm sorry if that inconveniences you.

26:26.758 --> 26:29.227
I appreciate your patience.

26:29.257 --> 26:30.723
Now that your victims have gone,

26:30.725 --> 26:33.432
compelled by me to remember
nothing of this night,

26:33.462 --> 26:37.630
you and I can take our time catching up.

26:48.656 --> 26:50.427
So before I end you,

26:50.429 --> 26:52.095
I just have one

26:52.097 --> 26:53.513
teensy little question.

26:55.831 --> 26:59.402
How did you know about the white oak?

27:03.944 --> 27:06.359
There's no shortage of
vampires who loathe you.

27:06.361 --> 27:10.085
Over the years, we've found
ways of staying connected.

27:10.553 --> 27:13.249
The world evolved, and those connections

27:13.251 --> 27:15.325
became simpler...

27:17.372 --> 27:19.255
Stronger

27:19.794 --> 27:21.674
and instantaneous.

27:22.189 --> 27:24.961
It started as a rumor on
a private message board.

27:27.253 --> 27:28.630
Now I've confirmed

27:28.660 --> 27:31.183
the truth for everyone.

27:31.185 --> 27:33.018
So go ahead.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.020
Kill me.

27:34.738 --> 27:38.021
But I will die filled with joy.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.922
Your sired are coming, Niklaus.

27:45.310 --> 27:47.455
It never stops.

27:47.485 --> 27:49.235
Never.

27:49.575 --> 27:53.157
They will destroy everything you love.

27:55.177 --> 27:58.428
And then they will use
the white oak to kill you.

27:58.430 --> 27:59.785
And at last,

27:59.815 --> 28:02.649
you will get the
retribution you deserve.

28:13.967 --> 28:17.166
So this men on be a fraction
of our potential enemies.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.449
In hindsight,

28:18.451 --> 28:20.201
could've been nicer to people.

28:20.203 --> 28:22.926
Or at least left fewer survivors.

28:22.956 --> 28:24.706
We don't know all their motivations.

28:24.708 --> 28:27.709
Half of these people could want
to put the bullet in your heart,

28:27.711 --> 28:29.627
end the sire war with
the pull of a trigger.

28:29.629 --> 28:32.013
I have an army devoted
to keeping me alive.

28:32.015 --> 28:34.599
The only people that care to protect you

28:35.200 --> 28:37.250
are standing in this very room.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.222
As you well know, Niklaus,
there is another way.

28:46.696 --> 28:48.897
You're going to run?

28:51.970 --> 28:54.035
There was a time when
the name Klaus Mikaelson

28:54.037 --> 28:55.737
was little more than a rumor.

28:55.739 --> 28:57.739
A shadowy figure who cast fear

28:57.741 --> 29:00.792
into the very bones of any
who heard whisper of him.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.411
I don't run,

29:03.929 --> 29:05.288
sister.

29:05.676 --> 29:07.248
I disappear.

29:10.423 --> 29:12.971
And tonight, the three of you

29:14.164 --> 29:15.840
are going to make that possible.

29:20.341 --> 29:22.093
Gaspar Cortez.

29:22.123 --> 29:23.999
From Klaus's line.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.466
We crossed him once,

29:25.496 --> 29:28.373
in the early days of the sire line war.

29:28.403 --> 29:31.072
Clearly, the truce between the
two lines has come to an end.

29:31.074 --> 29:33.441
Unfortunately, before
I got to him, there were

29:33.443 --> 29:34.909
a few more Strix casualties.

29:50.787 --> 29:52.510
Cortez burned the bodies.

29:52.512 --> 29:54.262
But he got his,

29:54.264 --> 29:56.014
and he won't be bothering
your sire line anymore.

29:57.467 --> 29:59.767
So go on, make this the
centerpiece for the wake.

29:59.769 --> 30:01.642
But before we mourn, just remember

30:01.672 --> 30:05.078
that this guy wasn't the
only one with an ax to grind.

30:05.108 --> 30:06.324
All right, rumor has it,

30:06.326 --> 30:08.109
vampires are coming in from all over,

30:08.111 --> 30:10.101
looking for the last of the white oak.

30:10.131 --> 30:14.782
So, we want to protect your
sire line, we need to know.

30:14.784 --> 30:16.534
This ain't over.

30:17.204 --> 30:19.954
It is just getting started.

30:29.265 --> 30:32.422
We'll just get Nik to
bleed into that chalice.

30:32.452 --> 30:34.535
Add some oleander and
a spotted owl feather,

30:34.537 --> 30:36.988
I'll give you the
incantation, and we'll be good.

30:36.990 --> 30:38.656
Impressive.

30:39.231 --> 30:40.664
You created this spell?

30:40.694 --> 30:42.226
Well, there's no
witchcraft on this planet

30:42.228 --> 30:43.607
that I haven't studied.

30:43.637 --> 30:45.563
But we both know you're
well aware of that.

30:51.287 --> 30:53.237
You and I met a century ago, didn't we?

30:53.239 --> 30:54.706
You were the only witch in town

30:54.708 --> 30:56.631
I couldn't charm into doing my bidding.

30:56.661 --> 30:59.243
Honestly, I just figured
you fancied the ladies.

31:00.714 --> 31:02.663
Oh, because that's the only reason

31:02.665 --> 31:04.571
a woman wouldn't swoon for you?

31:04.601 --> 31:06.632
Well, either that,

31:06.662 --> 31:09.270
or you're my long-lost,
not-so-dead older sister.

31:10.174 --> 31:11.606
I'm glad you're back.

31:11.608 --> 31:13.825
You should know,
Rebekah kept her promise

31:13.827 --> 31:15.368
to fight for you,

31:15.398 --> 31:17.091
before the curse.

31:17.121 --> 31:20.865
I suppose we're all lucky
Davina never gave up on you.

31:25.761 --> 31:27.861
She did right by me, didn't she?

31:30.054 --> 31:32.054
And I have to do right by her.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.045
You mind if I write the spell down?

31:37.761 --> 31:40.018
There's somewhere I ought to be.

31:46.810 --> 31:49.110
Is Cortez dead?

31:49.570 --> 31:51.229
Yes.

31:51.723 --> 31:54.482
I know you're not pleased
about the innocent lives lost.

31:54.484 --> 31:56.317
I'm sorry you had to see that.

31:56.319 --> 31:58.458
I get it.

31:58.829 --> 32:02.240
Three lives taken to spare 30.

32:06.152 --> 32:08.162
I've seen you kill before, Klaus.

32:09.998 --> 32:13.384
Did you expect me to just fall apart?

32:14.402 --> 32:16.730
I'm not that girl anymore.

32:17.118 --> 32:18.055
This morning, you said

32:18.085 --> 32:20.089
that Aurora stole something
from me; you were right.

32:20.119 --> 32:21.501
Aurora turned you because,

32:21.531 --> 32:23.928
in her twisted little maze of a mind,

32:23.930 --> 32:27.097
she believed my affections
for you would grow cold.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.021
She was wrong.

32:39.362 --> 32:40.995
She wasn't wrong.

32:43.470 --> 32:46.167
Your feelings may not have
changed, but mine have.

32:50.598 --> 32:54.296
I've been lying to
myself, trying to hold on.

32:54.326 --> 32:56.177
But the part of me that

32:56.179 --> 32:59.664
loved you, the part of me that hoped

32:59.694 --> 33:01.549
for your redemption...

33:01.551 --> 33:04.518
That part was human.

33:04.823 --> 33:06.220
And it's gone.

33:08.558 --> 33:10.891
I'm sorry.

33:45.937 --> 33:48.051
Everything okay with your family?

33:48.081 --> 33:49.284
Course not.

33:49.314 --> 33:51.104
Don't they need you?

33:51.882 --> 33:53.222
Desperately.

33:53.558 --> 33:56.109
But for the moment, they'll be fine.

33:59.629 --> 34:01.446
And in the meantime,

34:01.476 --> 34:04.317
I prefer to be here with you.

34:42.617 --> 34:44.574
I love you, Elijah.

34:45.511 --> 34:47.994
I always have loved you.

34:48.370 --> 34:50.196
And Jackson knew that.

34:52.623 --> 34:55.284
And he died loving me, despite it.

34:56.982 --> 34:59.511
And now every time I look at you,

34:59.541 --> 35:01.841
it's like he's right there and I'm...

35:01.843 --> 35:04.377
Hurting him all over again.

35:07.098 --> 35:09.265
He died because of me.

35:09.267 --> 35:10.267
So...

35:11.353 --> 35:13.970
out of respect for him...

35:15.685 --> 35:18.691
I have to let you go.

35:26.404 --> 35:29.285
Well, that seems like
the right thing to do.

35:31.323 --> 35:34.012
You know, I tried that myself.

35:35.095 --> 35:36.960
Didn't work.

36:05.936 --> 36:07.774
You taught me that.

36:08.101 --> 36:09.275
I will miss the magic.

36:11.719 --> 36:13.112
But tonight,

36:13.114 --> 36:16.532
I'm just happy to be back.

36:27.279 --> 36:29.396
Can you control it?

36:29.686 --> 36:31.115
The hunger?

36:33.003 --> 36:34.597
I can control it.

36:34.627 --> 36:37.737
And it wasn't the magic
that made me better, Davina.

36:39.861 --> 36:41.120
It was you.

36:43.912 --> 36:46.496
And as for the magic,

36:46.498 --> 36:49.416
if you ever get the urge...

36:49.418 --> 36:51.167
There are other ways.

36:52.270 --> 36:53.620
You don't have to do magic to feel it.

37:10.439 --> 37:12.305
Davina Claire.

37:12.307 --> 37:14.474
You are the best thing
about being alive.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.968
You ain't mean what you said
to him, so why'd you say it?

37:20.482 --> 37:22.649
Klaus kills people all the time.

37:23.002 --> 37:25.118
For rational reasons, irrational ones.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.619
He knows what happens when enemies

37:26.621 --> 37:28.477
are left to fester in their hatred.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.674
Today proved that.

37:30.931 --> 37:32.831
But he couldn't kill Aurora.

37:34.196 --> 37:35.514
You think he still loves her.

37:35.544 --> 37:36.694
I don't know.

37:39.089 --> 37:41.651
I used to think he could
protect me from anyone until her.

37:41.803 --> 37:44.471
Okay, look, you're a survivor.

37:44.473 --> 37:46.339
You can protect yourself.

37:46.566 --> 37:48.558
Well, I'm going to have to.

37:49.248 --> 37:50.404
If history's taught us anything,

37:50.434 --> 37:52.262
Aurora will be back.

37:52.586 --> 37:53.897
She'll get out.

37:54.138 --> 37:55.648
And she'll come for me.

37:55.650 --> 37:57.793
And when she does, I can't be wondering

37:57.823 --> 37:59.505
who Klaus loves or doesn't love.

37:59.535 --> 38:02.352
I can't be worried about
whether he's going to protect me

38:02.382 --> 38:05.024
or kill her.

38:05.289 --> 38:07.494
If I don't want to be another victim,

38:07.496 --> 38:09.279
I have to kill her myself.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.060
I'll see you tomorrow, Vincent.

38:33.791 --> 38:35.273
Is it done?

38:37.568 --> 38:40.944
Yes. And now any witch
who does a locator spell

38:40.946 --> 38:43.613
will believe you're
right here in New Orleans.

38:43.615 --> 38:44.658
You know, for all of his mischief,

38:44.688 --> 38:46.950
Kol truly is a master of his craft.

38:46.952 --> 38:49.452
Yes, well, drawing trouble is his forte.

38:50.405 --> 38:52.288
You'll thank him for me.

38:52.490 --> 38:54.357
Don't stop driving till
you're absolutely certain

38:54.359 --> 38:56.109
that you are safe.

38:56.756 --> 39:00.613
You don't have to remind
me how precious my cargo is.

39:04.502 --> 39:07.370
Keep him line, would you, sister?

40:12.353 --> 40:14.770
I trust you've said your good-byes.

40:14.772 --> 40:16.105
Something like that.

40:17.603 --> 40:20.165
We may be gone for quite some time.

40:20.703 --> 40:24.247
It's worth it to keep
Hope from what's coming.

40:24.249 --> 40:28.284
Besides, there's nothing
here for me anymore.

40:29.671 --> 40:31.483
Well, then...

40:31.513 --> 40:34.888
Perhaps we have more in
common than we thought.

40:49.858 --> 40:52.108
It's going to be quiet around here.

40:53.063 --> 40:55.145
I wouldn't bet on it.

41:41.876 --> 41:44.960
There was never any
hope for you, brother.

41:47.966 --> 41:49.988
No self-control.

41:50.599 --> 41:51.599
Finn.
