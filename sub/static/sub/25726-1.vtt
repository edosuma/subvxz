external stimuli?

00:49.750 --> 00:53.786

little too long to get to her.

sleeping, Ophelia?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.833
- Not so good I sleep
better at home.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.100

12:48.101 --> 12:50.002
we can't let you

- Well, let's just put that
down shall we, Ophelia?

13:12.159 --> 13:14.961
- But it's trying to
tell me something.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.363
- I think we might have to
consider a surgical procedure.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.698
- Well, I don't.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.534
Why?

13:22.535 --> 13:24.938
- Because nothing is working.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.294

dosage on Reynolds?

14:06.980 --> 14:07.980
- 20 CCs.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.119
- Can anybody hear me?

14:14.487 --> 14:15.889
What is going on?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.725
- This is a weather emergency.

Hurricane Sybil.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.556
It's getting bad out there.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.958
I'm just praying you
made it off the island

14:51.959 --> 14:53.059
before the storm hit.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.162
Please just call.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.606

- We've already spoken to her.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.190
She's been by to
visit you already.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.591
- She has.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.393
- You need to go back
and get some rest.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.730
- What about the hurricane?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.565
Please just let me call my mom.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.434
- No, you need to go
back and lay down.

- 97%.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.647
- Perfect.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.878
- But I feel fine.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.114
- SOPs dictate I have to
have you medical cleared

20:49.115 --> 20:50.649
after an accident.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.419
- Okay and then what?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.753
- We go to the station.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.021
You give your witness testimony,

20:56.022 --> 20:58.324
and then I can drop you
off wherever you need.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.325
- Okay.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.327
Hey, Ryan.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.628

21:02.629 --> 21:04.129
- I'm kind of hungry.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.731
- We can get something on
the way to the station.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.566
We can eat.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.501
Hey.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.338
What the hell happened to you?

21:12.339 --> 21:13.772
- What?

21:13.773 --> 21:14.840
- What's with the saw?

21:14.841 --> 21:15.841
- Uh, yeah.

21:19.211 --> 21:22.414
- My name's Amy these
people here...

21:22.415 --> 21:24.716
What is happening here?

21:24.717 --> 21:26.052
- Just stay put.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.888
- No, no, no.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.757
No, I didn't do anything.

21:31.758 --> 21:32.991
I didn't do anything.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.093
- I think an invasive
method would be

21:35.094 --> 21:36.895
the best course of treatment.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.164
Are these your
imaginary friends?

21:39.165 --> 21:41.401
Creative Amy very creative.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.803
- Just go.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.807
Don't you fucking move.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.289
What the hell was that about?

22:04.290 --> 22:06.592
You should come work for
the sheriff's office.

22:06.593 --> 22:07.759
- I can help you.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.127
The electroconvulsive therapy

22:09.128 --> 22:12.231
has been used
successfully for years.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.537
- So what are you
guys doing here?

22:18.538 --> 22:20.506
- I was at a party in
town with some friends.

22:20.507 --> 22:21.740
It was a girl's not out and...

22:21.741 --> 22:23.475
- It's official
business no offense.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.476
- Okay.

22:26.646 --> 22:27.779
- Hey, excuse me.

22:27.780 --> 22:31.116
- Hey, you can't
let them see us.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.350
- Why?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.786
- Very bad things
are happening here.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.555
You have to trust me.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.958
- Just let me take care of this.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.227
Hey, excuse me.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.830
Listen something strange
is happening here.

22:44.831 --> 22:48.767
I can't get a signal on
my phone or my radio.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.836
Hey, did you hear me?

22:50.837 --> 22:52.638
What are you doing?

22:52.639 --> 22:53.805
Drop the weapon.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.274
Drop the weapon.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.925
Go, go, go, go, go.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.732
- I'm gonna get something
for your side.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.933
- Let me see.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.036
Oh, my god what do we do?

24:38.878 --> 24:40.679
Attention, attention.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.782
Please proceed in a orderly
fashion to the nearest exit.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.984
Patients please wait in
your respective rooms

24:45.985 --> 24:48.654
as hospital and staff
will be by momentarily

24:48.655 --> 24:51.122
to assist you in
exiting the hospital.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.459
This is a recording message.

25:07.073 --> 25:11.210
- I just got the CT scans
like a few hours ago.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.764
- Amy.
- What?

25:32.765 --> 25:34.465
What so you know me now?

25:34.466 --> 25:35.567
- What you don't know?

25:35.568 --> 25:36.402
- What?

25:36.402 --> 25:37.336
- The timelines.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.336

25:44.176 --> 25:46.778
- Okay, that's close we
can't let that happen.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.947
- What happen?

25:49.381 --> 25:50.349
- Look I don't know how many
times you've been here before

25:50.350 --> 25:51.549
but you can't die here.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.018
- Well, I don't
wanna die anywhere.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.453
- No, what I'm saying is you
can't die in this place.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.322
- We just stay here forever.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.190
- What?

25:58.191 --> 25:59.658
- It's a hurricane.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.326
It's the meanest strongest one
anyone's ever seen before.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.161
It's the T-Rex of hurricanes.

26:03.162 --> 26:07.132
It passed over a secret
government test facility.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.934
- At Fort Miller.

26:08.935 --> 26:12.370
- It's done something
or broken something.

26:12.371 --> 26:13.739
It's woken up this place.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.374
- He and I have
been here before.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.377
- Like you started over.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.246
- Yeah, we've been here before.

26:20.247 --> 26:22.814
But most of the times we just...

26:22.815 --> 26:24.483
We've been separate.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.221
- Where am I?

26:30.456 --> 26:31.958
Where am I?

26:40.833 --> 26:44.102
- Hey, we can't let
that girl die here.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.737
- It's too late for
her it's not for you.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.773
- He's right come on.

26:47.774 --> 26:51.376
- Hey, come on I think
we gotta go this way.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.780
Just remember don't die here.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.987
- Oh, no, no, no, no not again.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.689
I can't make it out of here without him.
http://worldmkv.com/

27:03.690 --> 27:05.824
- Come on we have to try.

27:05.825 --> 27:06.992
- We needed to leave together.

27:06.993 --> 27:07.993
- We will leave together.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.594
- No, me and Ryan.

27:09.595 --> 27:10.429
- What do you mean?

27:10.430 --> 27:11.663
- We came in together.

27:11.664 --> 27:12.764
We're supposed to
leave together.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.465
We gotta go back and get him.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.801
- We have to go.

27:15.802 --> 27:18.136
- No, I've been through
this before, okay,

27:18.137 --> 27:19.404
and I've escaped without him

27:19.405 --> 27:20.739
and sometimes he's
escaped without me

27:20.740 --> 27:22.607
but we always end up back here.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.610
- Come on we have to go.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.104
- No, it's too late.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.674
We have to keep going.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.465
Shit.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.421
- Help me take this off.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.557
- Oh, you got it?
- Yeah.

28:47.794 --> 28:48.861
- Go, go, go.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.063
Hey.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.365
Hey, what's wrong?

29:27.366 --> 29:28.767
- This is just...

29:30.202 --> 29:32.703
I can't this is just...

29:32.704 --> 29:34.640
It's just all too much.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.144
- Hey, it's okay.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.411
We're gonna make it out of here

29:40.412 --> 29:42.213
and we're gonna be home
playing video games

29:42.214 --> 29:44.382
before you know it.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.650
- Video games.

29:45.651 --> 29:48.186
- Okay, so maybe I will.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.489
I was an only child
and I work a lot.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.790
But maybe Ryan will come over

29:52.791 --> 29:54.559
and he'll bring the
beer and pizza.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.962
- He seems like a good guy.

29:56.963 --> 30:00.832
- He's so handsome in his
uniform don't you think?

30:00.833 --> 30:01.833
Hey.

30:04.703 --> 30:08.406
You should try Nyloft
mascara it doesn't run.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.841
- You should be a model.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.410
- Oh, thanks.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.154
No, Amy.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.371

31:14.274 --> 31:16.307
I'm at Bay General.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.642
I can't get out.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.946
Please help the hurricane's
getting closer.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.333
- Amy, we gotta go.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.042
- Jen, is that you?

31:51.043 --> 31:52.978
Please just start over.

31:52.979 --> 31:56.814
They're about to do
something to me.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.449
- No, I can't go
through this again.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.650
He wants us to start over.

31:59.651 --> 32:00.918
- How do we start over?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.889
- I don't know but
we gotta find him.

32:45.764 --> 32:46.764
Ryan.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.459
- Oh, my god.

33:14.693 --> 33:15.861
- Oh, my god.

33:17.896 --> 33:20.166
What have they done to you?

33:25.337 --> 33:26.938
Oh, baby I'm sorry.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.109
I'm so sorry.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.215

33:38.817 --> 33:39.985
It's too late.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.521
Oh, god.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.461
- We gotta get you out of here.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.164
- Jen.

Please help me.
- You gotta be quiet.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.568

33:57.569 --> 33:58.903
Help me please.

33:58.904 --> 34:00.538
- Keep your voice down.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.872
- Go.
- We gotta go.

34:01.873 --> 34:02.874
We gotta go.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.556
Attention, attention.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.460

34:55.460 --> 34:57.662
- My name's Amy Barrett
I'm at Bay General.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.364
Please help the hurricane's
getting closer.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.531
- Ma'am, are you okay?

35:00.532 --> 35:03.168
I don't think we
got a hurricane.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.603
- No, no, no, no.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.525
Jen.

35:29.761 --> 35:30.761
Ryan.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.432
- This station has interrupted

35:34.433 --> 35:36.434

35:38.570 --> 35:42.607
at the request of local, state,
and federal authorities.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.543
The emergency alert system
has been activated.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.412
Broadcasts and cable systems

35:47.413 --> 35:50.749
should broadcast this
emergency message.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.827
- No, no, no, no, no.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.798
No, no I'm not pregnant.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.967
I'm am not fucking pregnant.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.969
I'm not pregnant.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.406
No, I'm not fucking pregnant.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.976
I'm not pregnant, no.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.057
- Due to heavy call volume

37:44.062 --> 37:46.397

Come on pick up.

37:50.502 --> 37:51.502
Oh, no.

38:30.175 --> 38:31.342
Ryan.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.510
- Who are you?

38:32.511 --> 38:34.679
Are you one of them?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.281
- No, Ryan it's me.

38:42.287 --> 38:44.154
- What's the number?

38:44.155 --> 38:44.990
- What.

38:44.991 --> 38:46.657
- What's the number?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.025
- What I don't understand.

38:48.026 --> 38:51.295
- There's a room
number what is it?

38:51.296 --> 38:52.296
- I don't.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.536
- What are you doing here?

38:58.537 --> 39:00.838
- I don't know I just
remember waking up here.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.339
- When did you first get here?

39:02.340 --> 39:05.175
- I don't remember it could've
been last night or...

39:05.176 --> 39:07.579
- When the hurricane started.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.084
- I think so.

39:21.527 --> 39:24.128
So how did you get here?

39:24.129 --> 39:26.897
- I placed a woman into
protective custody.

39:26.898 --> 39:30.668
She was at a party and witness
to a big drug deal gone bad.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.404
That witness was Jen.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.473
On our way to the station

39:35.474 --> 39:36.674
we were in that pile
up on the main road

39:36.675 --> 39:38.743
leading off the island.

39:38.744 --> 39:41.512
- I was in that too I think.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.213
Procedure dictates I'd
have to have her medically

39:43.214 --> 39:45.916
cleared being in a accident
while in my custody

39:45.917 --> 39:47.351
so I drove us here and...

39:47.352 --> 39:48.352
- And.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.424
- That was four years ago.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.360
- Four years.

39:56.462 --> 39:57.662
- All I could
figure is they were

39:57.663 --> 39:59.296
messing around with
something at Fort Miller

39:59.297 --> 40:00.931
and this hurricane came
through which just...

40:00.932 --> 40:02.366
It twisted up the hospital

40:02.367 --> 40:05.470
and it mixed up all these
timelines together.

40:05.471 --> 40:08.173
Go, go, go, go, go.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.605

41:14.606 --> 41:16.707
I heard about the
accident on the island,

41:16.708 --> 41:18.976
and I wanna make
sure you're okay.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.811

42:04.389 --> 42:05.623

42:05.624 --> 42:07.091
- Yell out and I'll
listen for you.

42:07.092 --> 42:08.859
Yell into a air vent.

42:08.860 --> 42:09.928

42:14.399 --> 42:15.333
Oh, no, no.

42:15.334 --> 42:16.334
Oh, no Ryan they heard me.

42:16.335 --> 42:17.534

42:17.535 --> 42:19.937
- Jen, keep yelling

Somebody help.

42:56.141 --> 42:57.108
- Hey.

42:57.109 --> 42:58.609
- You reached Beth's voicemail.

42:58.610 --> 43:00.177
Please leave a message.
- Mom, it's me I'm trapped.

43:00.178 --> 43:01.713
I'm trapped inside.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.580
Mom.

43:09.721 --> 43:10.721
Shit.

43:16.962 --> 43:18.295
- Who are you are one of them?

43:18.296 --> 43:19.797
- No, Ryan it's me.

43:19.798 --> 43:20.798
It's Amy.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.867
- You were in that pile
up on the main road

43:22.868 --> 43:24.501
leading off the island?

43:24.502 --> 43:26.571
- Yes, I mean I think so.

43:30.041 --> 43:31.442
- How many times?

43:32.778 --> 43:34.144
- I don't know what you mean.

43:34.145 --> 43:35.145
I can't remember the accident.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.814
- No, no, no how many times?

43:36.815 --> 43:38.082
- I don't know.
- Well, you've been here

43:38.083 --> 43:39.416
before you've seen
this before, right?

43:39.417 --> 43:40.985
- Yeah, but I don't
know what's going on.

43:40.986 --> 43:42.119
- And they haven't
gotten you yet.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.287
You haven't died yet?

43:43.288 --> 43:45.589
- No, I keep waking
up in my room.

43:45.590 --> 43:47.224
They haven't gotten me yet.
- That's the eye.

43:47.225 --> 43:49.760
The eye of the hurricane it
keeps recycling you back in.

43:49.761 --> 43:50.795
But you haven't died yet.

43:50.796 --> 43:53.230
- No.
- Okay, okay, okay.

43:53.231 --> 43:54.999
- Why what happens?

43:55.000 --> 43:57.201
- If you die Amy none of us
will ever be able to escape.

43:57.202 --> 43:59.770
- Attention, attention
please proceed.

43:59.771 --> 44:01.471
- This way.
- Where are we going?

44:01.472 --> 44:04.141
- I either have to get you
out or I have to find Jen.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.542
- I don't understand.

44:05.543 --> 44:06.511
- Well Jen and I
came in together

44:06.512 --> 44:08.012
so we have to leave together.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.646
But you came in by yourself
so you can leave by yourself.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.416
It's conservation of
energy or something.

44:12.417 --> 44:15.352
Talk was that the
hurricane damaged

44:15.353 --> 44:19.323
the quantum particle
lab at Fort Miller.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.859
They were experimenting
and manipulating

44:21.860 --> 44:24.762
paradoxical time anomalies.

44:24.763 --> 44:27.031
Nothing's in a linear
progression anymore.

44:27.032 --> 44:29.834
The timeline it can spit you
out whenever it wants to.

44:29.835 --> 44:31.368
You can wake up and it
could be next year.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.438
It could be two days ago.

44:35.673 --> 44:39.010
You can just stay in
this hospital forever.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.652
- Now give me your elephant.

44:48.653 --> 44:50.654
- No, please no.

44:50.655 --> 44:52.123
I need him.

44:57.662 --> 44:58.662
- Let's go.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.471
- Now just lay still.

45:09.574 --> 45:11.342
Oh, sorry cold right?

45:16.614 --> 45:18.950
My you have a healthy heart.

45:27.425 --> 45:29.127
Let's take a look.

45:33.331 --> 45:36.466
- Code White standard
division psychiatric ward

45:49.647 --> 45:52.082
Smart move you should come
work for the sheriff's office.

45:52.083 --> 45:53.117
Do you have the numbers
we gotta get out

45:53.118 --> 45:54.451
before the hurricane passes by.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.586
- What numbers?
- The numbers.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.754
I've been waiting
years for this.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.656
I need those numbers.

45:59.657 --> 46:00.858
- What?

46:00.859 --> 46:03.460
- Have you seen any
numbers like over again?

46:03.461 --> 46:05.162
- My room number 235.

46:05.163 --> 46:06.163
- 235, 235.

46:06.998 --> 46:08.834
- Wait, wait 133, 132.

46:10.068 --> 46:12.469
- 133, 132 those are the
numbers inside the rooms

46:12.470 --> 46:13.603
in the psych ward they
just put Jen and me in.

46:13.604 --> 46:14.972
- That's all that I know.

46:14.973 --> 46:17.007
- We've been here a long
time we've been trapped.

46:17.008 --> 46:18.308
The only way we can get
out of here and escape

46:18.309 --> 46:20.010
is we gotta get those numbers.

46:20.011 --> 46:22.279
It has to do with the
energy or something.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.582
It's gotta have something
to do with those numbers.

46:25.583 --> 46:28.085
Hey, are you alright?

46:28.086 --> 46:29.020
- I feel really weird.

46:29.021 --> 46:30.054
- It's almost your time again.

46:30.055 --> 46:31.755
You're resettling.

46:31.756 --> 46:33.858
Only it's gonna be less time
they get you when you reset.

46:33.859 --> 46:35.092
You gotta get out
before the storm hits.

46:35.093 --> 46:36.360
- What's happening?

46:36.361 --> 46:37.895
- You're restarting,
you're speeding up.

46:37.896 --> 46:38.830
You're running out
of time before

46:38.831 --> 46:41.165
each reset back into the loop.

46:41.166 --> 46:44.735
You have to get out
before the storm comes.

46:55.380 --> 46:56.914
- 911 what is your emergency?

46:56.915 --> 46:57.948
- My name's Amy Barrett.

46:57.949 --> 46:59.216
I'm about to be in a accident.

46:59.217 --> 47:01.919
I'm trapped with a
sheriff's deputy.

47:01.920 --> 47:04.922
- Ma'am, can you give
me your location?

47:04.923 --> 47:07.592
Ma'am.
- Yeah, not again, not again.

47:58.543 --> 47:59.810
Jen, oh my god.

48:18.029 --> 48:20.131
- You're not one of them.

48:23.268 --> 48:26.403
I need the numbers,
the room number.

48:26.404 --> 48:28.672
I need the number,
I need the number.

48:28.673 --> 48:31.475
The room number there's
a room number here.

48:31.476 --> 48:32.643
- I told Ryan.

48:33.578 --> 48:36.081
I told Ryan everything I know.

48:41.652 --> 48:42.652
- Ryan.

48:45.390 --> 48:47.058
You've seen my Ryan.

48:53.631 --> 48:54.631
How is he?

48:55.566 --> 48:56.566
Is he okay?

48:58.403 --> 48:59.904
It's been so long.

49:01.006 --> 49:02.907
- He's looking for you.

49:11.449 --> 49:12.782
- Next time you see
him will you tell him

49:12.783 --> 49:13.984
will you tell him,
will you tell him

49:13.985 --> 49:16.153
that I love him could
you tell me that?

49:16.154 --> 49:17.154
Could you?

49:18.389 --> 49:20.190
- Tell him yourself.

49:20.191 --> 49:21.491
Come on.

49:21.492 --> 49:23.328
Let's get out of here.

49:36.541 --> 49:38.975
- I can't wait to see him.

49:38.976 --> 49:42.312
I just want him to hold me
just for a little while.

49:42.313 --> 49:44.881
- We'll find him together, okay.

49:44.882 --> 49:46.451
- Maybe he'll call.

49:47.652 --> 49:49.520
- Come on we gotta keep moving.

49:58.263 --> 50:01.731
- Jen, I'm sorry I
brought you here.

50:01.732 --> 50:04.168
Just keep trying until
we get it right.

50:04.169 --> 50:05.702
Don't give up.

50:05.703 --> 50:07.605
I won't give up on you.

50:08.806 --> 50:10.141
I love you, Jen.

50:11.142 --> 50:12.477
Jen, I love you.

50:24.622 --> 50:25.822
- 911 what is your emergency?

50:25.823 --> 50:26.757
- Hi, my name's Amy Barrett.

50:26.758 --> 50:28.292
I'm at Bay General.

50:28.293 --> 50:30.794
I am trapped inside with a
sheriff deputy named Ryan

50:30.795 --> 50:32.329
and a woman named Jen.

50:32.330 --> 50:34.432
We can't get out
please send someone.

50:46.677 --> 50:49.679
- Code White standard
division psychiatric ward

50:49.680 --> 50:50.681
message 113.

50:58.689 --> 51:00.390
- Calm down my child.

51:00.391 --> 51:01.658
You are safe here.
- Amy don't listen to him.

51:01.659 --> 51:02.959
- Don't listen to that spirit.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.428
Hey, let's go to the chapel.

51:04.429 --> 51:06.429
- Amy, you can't trust him.
- You'll be safe there.

51:27.252 --> 51:29.587
- Jen.
- Get down, get down.

51:30.788 --> 51:32.790
- Jen, I'm so sorry Jen.

51:33.658 --> 51:35.492
- I love you Ryan.

51:35.493 --> 51:36.960
- Where are you?

51:36.961 --> 51:38.162
- I don't know.

51:38.163 --> 51:40.197
- Please baby just
tell me where you are.

51:40.198 --> 51:41.865
- I'm all alone.

51:41.866 --> 51:43.400
- What room number do you see?

51:43.401 --> 51:44.868
- I'm scared, Ryan.

51:44.869 --> 51:47.337
- Don't be scared baby.

51:47.338 --> 51:49.606
Hey, you know what - What

51:49.607 --> 51:52.476
- I've got this bad
ass muscle car.

51:52.477 --> 51:53.444
I've been restoring it.

51:53.445 --> 51:54.644
It's in my grandma's barn.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.346
When we get out of here,

51:56.347 --> 51:58.815
I'm gonna take you
out on a date.

51:58.816 --> 52:00.784
- It's a deal.

52:00.785 --> 52:03.086
No, no, no they're back.

52:03.087 --> 52:04.321
No, no, no. - Jen.

52:04.322 --> 52:07.625
- Please come please,
please hurry.

52:11.762 --> 52:13.963
- What is going on here?

52:13.964 --> 52:14.998
- I don't know this hurricane's

52:14.999 --> 52:16.966
opened up a portal or something.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.002
- I don't get it.

52:19.003 --> 52:20.570
- I don't know anymore it's
like hell or something.

52:20.571 --> 52:22.172
- Yeah.

52:22.173 --> 52:23.407
- I've died over 600 times

52:23.408 --> 52:26.176
and each one is more horrific.

52:26.177 --> 52:28.445
- We gotta get out of here.

52:28.446 --> 52:29.946
- You know I figured that

52:29.947 --> 52:31.147
the only time that Jen and
I could escape together

52:31.148 --> 52:32.449
is when we first
come in together

52:32.450 --> 52:35.585
before either one
of us even died.

52:35.586 --> 52:38.154
- Like the first time I saw
the two of you in yours

52:38.155 --> 52:39.423
in the waiting room. - Yeah,

52:39.424 --> 52:40.624
that would've been
the time to leave.

52:40.625 --> 52:41.559
I mean anyone how
many times we've been

52:41.560 --> 52:42.726
back in that waiting room

52:42.727 --> 52:44.228
but each time we think
it's the first.

52:44.229 --> 52:47.030
- So you don't know that you
need to turn around and leave.

52:47.031 --> 52:48.965
- Yeah, exactly.

52:48.966 --> 52:51.402
God I fucking hate his place.

52:58.576 --> 52:59.743
- I keep waking up back here.

52:59.744 --> 53:02.880
There has to be
something in this room.

53:16.227 --> 53:17.394
- Amy, I saw you called

53:17.395 --> 53:18.895
but didn't leave a message.

53:18.896 --> 53:20.230
I'm worried about you.

53:20.231 --> 53:22.732
I can't lose you like
I lost your sister.

53:22.733 --> 53:23.733
Call me.

53:28.038 --> 53:31.208
- Due to heavy call volume

53:41.952 --> 53:42.952
- Cute dog.

53:45.390 --> 53:47.491
Hey, look at me.

53:47.492 --> 53:50.227
We're gonna make it out of this.

53:51.061 --> 53:52.296
- That's weird.

53:52.297 --> 53:53.297
- What.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.004
- I don't remember seeing
this back here before.

54:04.475 --> 54:06.443
- It's from Sybil High School.

54:06.444 --> 54:09.813
It's a reminder to renew
your alumina membership.

54:09.814 --> 54:10.814
- Great.

54:11.782 --> 54:13.182
Hey, remind me to renew
my health insurance

54:13.183 --> 54:15.353
if I ever get out of here.

54:18.556 --> 54:19.989
- You okay?

54:19.990 --> 54:21.257
I think you're resetting.

54:21.258 --> 54:22.492
- What?

54:22.493 --> 54:23.693
It's too soon for that.

54:23.694 --> 54:24.928
- No, no it's speeding up.

54:24.929 --> 54:25.730
We gotta get the
hell out of here.

54:25.731 --> 54:27.230
We gotta find Jen.

54:27.231 --> 54:29.233
Try to remember the numbers.

55:06.671 --> 55:08.204
- But I feel fine.

55:08.205 --> 55:10.474
- SOPs dictate I have to
have you medically cleared

55:10.475 --> 55:12.141
after an accident.

55:12.142 --> 55:13.543
- Okay.

55:13.544 --> 55:14.878
And then what?

55:14.879 --> 55:16.079
- Well, we go to the station.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.347
You give your witness testimony,

55:17.348 --> 55:19.749
and then I can drop you
off wherever you need.

55:19.750 --> 55:20.750
- Okay.

55:21.686 --> 55:22.752
Hey Ryan.

55:22.753 --> 55:24.020
- Yeah.

55:24.021 --> 55:25.522
- I'm kind of hungry.

55:25.523 --> 55:27.156
- We can get something on
the way to the station.

55:27.157 --> 55:27.992
We can eat. http://worldmkv.com/

55:27.993 --> 55:29.359
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.260
- I'd like that.

55:31.261 --> 55:32.896
You know what? - What?

55:32.897 --> 55:35.566
- You're kind of cool for a cop.

55:36.667 --> 55:37.901
- Yeah, I've heard that before.

55:37.902 --> 55:39.302
- Hey.

55:39.303 --> 55:41.605
Hey, you have to leave now.

55:41.606 --> 55:43.039
You have to leave, you have to.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.641
You have leave now.

55:44.642 --> 55:45.543
- I can't fit a wallet

55:45.544 --> 55:46.743
in this dress. - Ryan,

55:46.744 --> 55:47.777
can you hear me you
have to hear me.

55:47.778 --> 55:49.012
You have to leave.

55:49.013 --> 55:50.080
- Ms. Ardsen.

55:51.081 --> 55:53.550
- That's me.
- Have a seat.

55:53.551 --> 55:55.285
- No, don't go.

55:56.186 --> 55:57.754
- We'll get you checked.

55:57.755 --> 56:00.490
- Hey, wanna come with me?

56:00.491 --> 56:02.459
- Well, it would be
better and quicker

56:02.460 --> 56:03.493
if we just saw you.

56:03.494 --> 56:05.094
- Oh, okay.

56:05.095 --> 56:07.030
- Don't let her go, Ryan.

56:07.031 --> 56:09.366
- I won't leave without you.

56:40.565 --> 56:42.098
- 911 what is your emergency?

56:42.099 --> 56:43.733
- My name's Amy Barrett.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.069

- Oh, no.

56:57.948 --> 56:58.948
945.

57:25.776 --> 57:27.044
- They're here.

57:35.553 --> 57:36.554
- Excuse me.

57:37.722 --> 57:39.188
Have you seen a
sheriff's deputy?

57:39.189 --> 57:40.924
We came in together and
now I can't find him.

57:40.925 --> 57:42.125
- Ryan.

57:42.126 --> 57:43.459
- You know his name
do you know him?

57:43.460 --> 57:45.294
Have you seen him?
- Jen, it's me.

57:45.295 --> 57:48.064
- I don't know you.
- Jen, it's me Amy.

57:48.065 --> 57:51.034
- Father, have you seen
the sheriff's deputy?

57:51.035 --> 57:52.602
- Come on.

57:52.603 --> 57:54.604

58:11.388 --> 58:13.189
- No, but I'm scared.

58:13.190 --> 58:14.458
- Yeah, me too.

58:16.293 --> 58:18.094
- We've met before, haven't we?

58:18.095 --> 58:19.095
- Yeah.

58:19.897 --> 58:21.331
- How many times?

58:22.833 --> 58:23.833
- Too many.

58:31.642 --> 58:35.813

Nyloft mascara it doesn't run.

Here, come on.

58:55.265 --> 58:57.935
We gotta figure out what 945 is.

58:59.103 --> 59:00.336

59:00.337 --> 59:03.372

There i a psychotic

You have to come now.

Amy Barrett Bay
General help please.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.650
You have to send
somebody right now.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:27.324
Motherfucker.

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:58.855

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:00.189
- Ryan.
- Ryan.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:01.190
Let's go.

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:06.863
- Is there a room 945?

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:07.832
- Are you sure?

01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:09.565
- Yes, 945.

01:01:09.566 --> 01:01:11.100
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Do you know where that is?

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:14.203
- Absolutely sure it's 945.
- Yes, 945.

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:16.806
Why you know where
it is don't you?

01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:18.141
- It's the room on the other
side of the psych ward.

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:19.475
It's the infectious
disease section.

01:01:19.476 --> 01:01:21.711
- Okay, which way is it?

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:24.882
Ryan, which way is it?
- It's this way.

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:48.938
- What's wrong?

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:50.239
- I can't go through there.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.775
- What, you said we have
to go through this ward.

01:01:51.776 --> 01:01:52.976
We don't have much more time.

01:01:52.977 --> 01:01:53.944
- I'm sorry.

01:01:53.945 --> 01:01:55.178
- Why what's in there?

01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:56.445
- Jen's in there.
- What?

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:57.713
- Her soul's trapped in there.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.549
She's in a state of
permanent torture.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.920
- Well, is there another way?

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:06.857
- It's a long way
around but yeah.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.326
Do you hear that?

01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:11.928
The hurricane's passing over.

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:14.297
We don't have much time
we gotta hurry come on.

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:16.801
Her room's coming up this way.

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:20.004
It's a trap it's not 945.

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:25.975
If the hurricane's coming by

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:28.745
one more chance get to the loop.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:54.670

01:02:58.442 --> 01:02:59.442
113.

01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:02.946
- It's from Sybil High School.

01:03:02.947 --> 01:03:05.014
It's a reminder to renew
your alumni membership.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.283

It's gotta be here.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.323
It's gotta be here somewhere.

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:50.059
- Where is it?

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:57.233
- Open the door.

01:08:57.234 --> 01:08:58.367

Take her to the light.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:01.871
Take her to the light.

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:04.072
Go to the light go, go, go.

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:05.073
- You first.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.943
- Come on out.

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:09.144
- I'm right behind you.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.848
- Back away from the door.

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:27.595
- Okay, Ms. Barrett,
are you ready?

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.298
- Am I ready for what?

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:31.399
- To be discharged.

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:33.969
Unless you wanna stay.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.471
- That's okay I think I'll go.

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:37.540
- That's what I thought.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.607
Well, when you're ready

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:41.278
William here will wheel you out.

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:46.383
- That's okay I think I'll walk.

01:09:55.259 --> 01:09:59.563
- Okay, Ms. Barrett, we have a
car waiting for you outside.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:33.028
- The strongest storm on record

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:34.863
to ever hit U.S. shores.

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:38.033
Hurricane Sybil left a trail
of destruction in the area.

01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:39.835
Strangely this storm
of the century

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:44.308
lost steam as soon as it
left the metropolitan area.

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:27.350
- How's work?

01:11:27.351 --> 01:11:28.884
- It's fine.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.486
Hey mom. - Yeah.

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:33.656
- Is it okay if I take the
Ray out for a little spin?

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:37.726
- Honey, you know your dad got
rid of that when he left.

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:40.295
Amy, you need to get help.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.566
I'm sure the old memory of
your sister still haunts you,

01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:46.234
but I can't lose you too.

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:47.770
- I'm fine, mom.

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:50.774
- I'm serious I'm
worried about you.

01:11:57.947 --> 01:12:00.049
- Alright you're all set.

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:06.321
- Do you remember this guy?

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.556
- As a little girl
she would always

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:09.758
hand this to you
when you were sad.

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.094
- Yeah, Ophelia.

01:12:43.427 --> 01:12:44.928
- Ophelia Barrett.

01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:59.042
You are doing the
right thing, Ophelia.

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:46.054
Let's see here.

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:49.057
All of your physiological
tests came back normal.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:50.425
Vitals look good.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.128
No underlying medical issues.

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:55.498
- That's good right?

01:13:55.499 --> 01:13:57.833
- Let's talk about your family.

01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:59.401
Is your father alive?

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:00.769
- Yeah.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:04.239
- Is he in good health?

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.610
- I don't know I don't really.

01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:08.711
- I see.

01:14:08.712 --> 01:14:10.547
How about your mother?

01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:14.918
- My mom she died a while back.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:21.690
My step mom took care of
me after my dad left us.

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:22.725
- I see.

01:14:22.726 --> 01:14:25.193
Any brothers or sisters?

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:28.230
- I have a half sister Amy.

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:30.733
I live with her and my step mom.

01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:32.801
- Do the two of you get along?

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:35.138
- Yes, I love Amy very much.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:39.408
- Is everything good with Amy?

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:44.147
- Well, she's been
in and out of mental

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:48.885
- Mental institutions?

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.319
- Yeah.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.828
- And how are you
sleeping, Ophelia?

01:15:32.829 --> 01:15:35.898
- Not so good I sleep
better at home.

01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:38.033
- Well, we can't let
you go home just yet.

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.467
- But I can't sleep.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:42.638
- Well, we'll have to
adjust some of the dosages.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:43.639
- No.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:47.576
I miss Amy.

01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:50.479
- What was that?

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.382
- I miss Amy.

01:15:57.253 --> 01:16:01.189
- I think we might have to
consider a surgical procedure.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:02.190
- Why?

01:16:03.259 --> 01:16:05.694
- Because you've been
here for six months.

01:16:05.695 --> 01:16:08.697
Nothing seems to be working.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:09.698
- When?

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.269
- Tomorrow first thing.

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:16.872
You are very unhappy, Ophelia.

01:16:16.873 --> 01:16:19.375
The sooner the better I think.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.081
- Knock, knock.

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:36.318
Rise and shine it's
time for breakfast.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.921
I'm Tara I'm gonna
be your nurse.

01:17:38.922 --> 01:17:40.356
Ophelia, Ophelia.

01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:43.359
Code blue, code blue.

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:45.628
Come on, come on.

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:51.533
Someone got the code cart.

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:53.369
Call respiratory stat.

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:55.805
Come on, come on.

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:01.376
- Mom, you're...

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.912
Mom, you're hurting me.

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:05.849
Mom, you're hurting me.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.327
- What the hell was that about?

01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:29.165
You should come work for
the sheriff's office.

01:19:32.902 --> 01:19:34.102
- Then maybe Ryan will come over

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.871
and he'll bring the
beer and pizza.

01:19:35.872 --> 01:19:37.940
You should try Nyloft mascara.

01:19:37.941 --> 01:19:38.875
It doesn't run.

01:19:38.876 --> 01:19:40.242
- You should be a model.

01:19:40.243 --> 01:19:41.845
- Oh, thanks.

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:22.017
- This is Amy Barrett
I'm at Bay General.
