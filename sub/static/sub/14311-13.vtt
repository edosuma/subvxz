WEBVTT

01:58.206 --> 01:59.916
<i>The old red and blue.</i>

02:00.083 --> 02:02.085
<i>Not too shabby.</i>

02:10.051 --> 02:12.137
I take it our deal is off?

02:14.014 --> 02:17.809
Not enough money in the world for me
to turn a blind eye to your great works.

02:17.976 --> 02:22.356
Keep the light on
because I'm coming for you.

02:26.860 --> 02:30.364
It appears you have a job opening.

02:30.530 --> 02:32.699
We'll take it.

03:44.688 --> 03:47.649
I really should start locking
those windows.

03:47.816 --> 03:51.153
So do we have a deal?

03:51.319 --> 03:54.322
If you really want a job,
you'll have to prove yourself.

03:54.489 --> 03:55.991
Pass one simple test.

03:56.658 --> 03:59.202
Destroy Spider-Man.

04:00.746 --> 04:03.331
We were hoping you'd say that.

04:03.498 --> 04:09.212
Oh, you don't mind
if we have a little fun with him first?

04:09.379 --> 04:11.423
I don't micromanage.

04:19.180 --> 04:22.267
<i>She looks a lot better, considering
she just had a heart attack.</i>

04:22.934 --> 04:25.854
<i>I still hate seeing her hooked up
to all these machines.</i>

04:26.396 --> 04:30.150
<i>She must have been so scared.
And I wasn't here for her.</i>

04:37.657 --> 04:40.952
<i>Uncle Ben said that with great power
comes great responsibility.</i>

04:41.161 --> 04:43.038
<i>But shouldn't my first responsibility...</i>

04:43.205 --> 04:46.249
<i>...be to the people
who rely on Peter Parker?</i>

04:51.046 --> 04:53.715
Flash, you gave me a pretty hard
time the other day.

04:53.882 --> 04:56.593
Just the other day? I must be slipping.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.221
Thanks for the reality check.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.807
Don't mention it.

05:02.224 --> 05:03.725
And I mean not to anyone.

05:03.892 --> 05:06.144
Hey, Petey, how's your aunt?

05:06.311 --> 05:08.230
Better, thanks.

05:08.396 --> 05:11.233
And guys, look,
I'm so sorry about how I acted.

05:11.399 --> 05:14.486
- It's cool.
- You must be under a ton of stress.

05:14.694 --> 05:16.780
Yeah, you could probably use
an angst break.

05:16.947 --> 05:19.115
We could use help
holding the big balloon...

05:19.282 --> 05:20.951
...at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

05:21.117 --> 05:22.452
I can't. I'm sorry.

05:22.619 --> 05:25.247
If the doc gives the okay,
I'll bring Aunt May home.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.082
- That's okay.
- Are you going today?

05:27.249 --> 05:29.459
Because I'll go
with you to the hospital...

05:29.626 --> 05:33.421
...after school, if you want.

05:33.588 --> 05:35.423
Well, thanks.

05:35.590 --> 05:38.260
I'm sure Aunt May
would love to see you.

05:38.718 --> 05:41.179
Well, okay, I--

05:41.346 --> 05:43.807
I'd better get to class.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.770
Pete, I know you've got
a lot on your mind...

05:49.771 --> 05:51.773
...but I went on a date with Eddie.

05:51.940 --> 05:53.275
A date? But--?

05:53.441 --> 05:56.444
He only asked me out because
he thought you and I were a thing.

05:56.611 --> 06:00.115
He wanted to hurt you
and he didn't mind using me to do it.

06:00.824 --> 06:03.952
It has been pretty rough
between us...

06:04.119 --> 06:06.371
...but no, no, he's still my bro.

06:06.538 --> 06:08.623
Be careful, tiger.

06:08.790 --> 06:11.293
I don't think he's your bro anymore.

06:14.671 --> 06:18.133
<i>- It's Eddie. Message me.
- Hey, Eddie, it's Pete.</i>

06:18.300 --> 06:22.971
<i>Look, about your job, man, I'm--
I really am sorry.</i>

06:23.138 --> 06:25.807
Hey, was just changing.

06:25.974 --> 06:27.475
Appreciate the call.

06:27.642 --> 06:30.312
So how about we hook up
after class?

06:30.478 --> 06:33.356
<i>Rain check? Look, I really need to be
with Aunt May.</i>

06:33.523 --> 06:36.401
Sure. We'll see each other
soon enough...

06:36.568 --> 06:38.987
...Spider-Man.

06:40.697 --> 06:42.824
- Everything okay?
- A-okay.

06:42.991 --> 06:45.911
Unless your aunt's developed
an affinity for hospital food...

06:46.077 --> 06:48.830
...she can go home tomorrow
to enjoy Thanksgiving.

06:48.997 --> 06:51.917
That's wonderful, Dr. Bromwell.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.419
Now I can fix my usual turkey dinner.

06:54.586 --> 06:56.838
I got it covered, Aunt May.

06:57.005 --> 07:00.926
I'll prepare the feast.
How hard can it be?

07:08.224 --> 07:11.227
Oh, no, no, my yarns!

07:13.730 --> 07:17.025
I wonder if Romita's delivers
turkey-and-fixings pizza?

07:18.693 --> 07:20.028
<i>Oh, late as usual.</i>

07:20.528 --> 07:23.198
<i>But web-slinging should get me
to Aunt May on</i> time.

07:25.116 --> 07:27.953
<i>The gene cleanser.
I almost forgot I hid it here.</i>

07:28.119 --> 07:31.373
<i>This antidote solved Doc Connors'
little Lizard problem.</i>

07:31.539 --> 07:33.792
<i>And I bet it could solve
my spider problem too.</i>

07:33.959 --> 07:36.544
<i>I mean, sure,
Spidey saved a lot of lives...</i>

07:36.711 --> 07:38.254
<i>...but is that why I do it?</i>

07:38.421 --> 07:41.049
<i>Or am I in it for the thrill,
the escape?</i>

07:47.889 --> 07:51.935
Oh, you don't need to wear a mask
with us, Pete.

07:52.102 --> 07:53.895
We know all your secrets...

07:54.896 --> 07:57.899
...because, of course, we were you.

07:59.901 --> 08:01.820
The Symbiote. But I destroyed it!

08:01.987 --> 08:05.657
Did you really think
a little refrigeration would do us in?

08:05.865 --> 08:07.575
You ensnared another human being?

08:08.493 --> 08:10.578
Someone better suited to our gifts...

08:13.581 --> 08:18.420
...and to our mission:
Destroying you for rejecting us.

08:18.586 --> 08:24.843
From now on, we're poison
to Peter Parker and Spider-Man.

08:25.010 --> 08:27.095
We're Venom!

08:48.450 --> 08:51.494
Destroying you now
would be too easy.

08:51.995 --> 08:54.497
You haven't suffered enough.

08:54.664 --> 08:59.794
And we want to dismantle you,
piece by piece.

08:59.961 --> 09:06.217
After all, we know who you are,
and everyone you care about.

09:08.219 --> 09:09.971
No.

09:10.638 --> 09:12.348
No!

09:19.189 --> 09:20.231
<i>Gotta reach Aunt</i> May.

09:35.246 --> 09:39.501
Oh, sorry. Bad idea,
startling my favorite heart patient.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.170
Oh, flowers, huh? Boyfriend?

09:42.337 --> 09:46.091
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm sure Peter sent them.

09:46.257 --> 09:49.803
Although the card's signed,
"Guess who?"

09:53.098 --> 09:55.433
Stay away from her!

10:16.788 --> 10:20.875
- So how are you getting home?
- Peter's picking me up.

10:21.042 --> 10:22.627
You're not going near her.

10:26.798 --> 10:28.174
Fine.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.469
She's not our only target.

10:31.636 --> 10:36.891
After all, we know who
you love the most, bro.

10:37.058 --> 10:38.476
Eddie?

10:38.643 --> 10:40.687
You guessed.

10:51.990 --> 10:56.327
Think, Pete. Besides Aunt May,
who would Eddie believe I loved?

10:56.494 --> 10:58.288
Mary Jane.

11:17.015 --> 11:20.560
Well, if it isn't the big turkey himself.

11:20.727 --> 11:23.188
<i>Oh, I still can't believe
the Symbiote got Eddie.</i>

11:23.354 --> 11:25.356
<i>Or maybe I don't wanna believe.</i>

11:25.523 --> 11:28.193
<i>He was right there
when I tried to destroy it...</i>

11:28.359 --> 11:29.402
...and M.J. warned me.

11:29.569 --> 11:32.238
<i>If I'd listened, she wouldn't be
in danger right now.</i>

11:32.405 --> 11:36.034
<i>There she is! And with Flash.</i>

11:36.201 --> 11:38.453
<i>Well, at least Flash isn't evil.</i>

11:38.620 --> 11:42.040
<i>Okay, well, at least he's not possessed
by an evil Symbiote.</i>

11:42.207 --> 11:44.375
<i>At least not as far as I know.</i>

11:44.542 --> 11:46.211
<i>Just gotta keep M.J. in sight.</i>

11:46.377 --> 11:49.589
<i>My spider-sense will warn me
if Venom tries any surprise attacks.</i>

11:51.841 --> 11:54.886
Got to hand it to you, big boy,
you're persistent.

11:55.053 --> 11:58.223
But how about you chill long enough
for us to wish Gwen luck?

11:58.389 --> 12:01.392
Never mind. Eddie Brock's with her.

12:19.577 --> 12:21.955
Sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

12:22.121 --> 12:24.249
- Oh, my God.
- Was that cool?

12:24.415 --> 12:25.750
That was Spider-Man.

12:28.962 --> 12:31.464
<i>Where is she? No.</i>

12:34.926 --> 12:36.678
<i>Hang on, Gwen.</i>

12:37.595 --> 12:44.102
What's the matter, bro?
Spider-sense didn't tingle?

13:02.912 --> 13:05.832
Mommy, Mommy, that girl.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.920
Oh, my. She's so lifelike.

13:11.087 --> 13:14.424
<i>Symbie and I spent so much
quality time together...</i>

13:14.590 --> 13:17.969
<i>...Venom doesn't register
to my spider-sense as a threat.</i>

13:18.594 --> 13:21.848
Eddie, please, fight it.
Don't let the Symbiote control you.

13:22.056 --> 13:26.686
No one's being controlled.
We simply share the same desire.

13:26.853 --> 13:29.063
Your destruction.

13:43.786 --> 13:45.788
Come on, Eddie,
you've always liked her.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.123
Let me save her.

13:47.665 --> 13:51.127
Oh, you'd love that, to be her hero.

13:52.879 --> 13:55.131
But you're the villain here.

14:17.904 --> 14:21.657
- Don't do this, bro.
- We're not brothers.

14:21.824 --> 14:24.160
Our parents may have died together...

14:24.327 --> 14:27.997
...but you had
your precious aunt and uncle.

14:28.164 --> 14:32.377
We had no one.
We've always been alone.

14:32.543 --> 14:35.338
Until now.

14:35.505 --> 14:37.632
Then we're done talking.

14:41.928 --> 14:44.222
Woodoak's mascot's pretty cool.

14:44.389 --> 14:47.392
But the animatronic chick
makes him look like King Kong.

14:47.558 --> 14:49.268
Not Kenny, the monkey.

14:49.435 --> 14:51.562
King Kong was an ape, not a--

14:51.729 --> 14:53.856
- Gwen!
- Not a Gwen?

14:54.023 --> 14:55.358
That makes no sense.

15:06.702 --> 15:10.540
Bet you're missing the black suit now.

15:10.706 --> 15:12.917
Oh, will you please just shut up?

15:14.293 --> 15:19.549
That Spidey, he can quip it out...

15:20.174 --> 15:22.969
...but he can't take it.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.723
Mustangs. Hero time. Let's move.

15:27.890 --> 15:32.645
- Flash, they can't leave the balloon.
- Forget the balloon. Gwen's in trouble.

15:32.812 --> 15:34.939
QB's called an audible. Break.

15:35.106 --> 15:38.901
Rand Robertson, don't you dare.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.919
Come on.
If that's the best you've got...

15:57.086 --> 15:59.088
...I'll stick with
the red, torn and blue.

15:59.255 --> 16:02.842
Oh, we can shred more than a suit.

16:05.928 --> 16:08.347
Now, shouldn't y'all
have seen that coming?

16:10.016 --> 16:12.477
A slow descent. Clever.

16:12.643 --> 16:15.104
But you won't save her that way.

16:19.484 --> 16:20.526
L90ty0u.

16:24.530 --> 16:26.616
No!

16:29.494 --> 16:32.455
- Gwen, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

16:32.622 --> 16:34.290
I think.

16:36.125 --> 16:39.545
- Thanks for the assist.
- Anytime. Now, get that creep!

16:39.754 --> 16:41.172
That's the plan, Eugene.

17:00.316 --> 17:03.486
We've toyed with you long enough.

17:03.653 --> 17:06.405
Okay, you win.

17:08.406 --> 17:10.576
Of course we win.

17:10.785 --> 17:13.329
Not you. It.

17:13.496 --> 17:15.830
The Symbiote's proven its point.

17:15.998 --> 17:18.501
I'm nothing without it.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.045
Take me back.

17:23.297 --> 17:27.093
That's what it wants, right?
A reunion with its first love?

17:28.678 --> 17:32.098
The Symbiote's found
a better partner in me.

17:32.306 --> 17:35.601
"Me"? Not "us"?

17:36.602 --> 17:40.231
Wait. No. You can't do this.

17:40.398 --> 17:43.734
Don't-- Don't leave me.

17:54.579 --> 17:59.959
You tricked us.
The emotions all taste wrong.

18:00.126 --> 18:04.213
You never wanted us back at all.

18:04.380 --> 18:07.383
- You do know me well.
- FooL

18:07.550 --> 18:13.222
You've let us back in,
and we will have you.

18:33.743 --> 18:36.245
Still slow on the uptake, huh?

18:36.412 --> 18:39.415
You're a disease. They're the cure.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.255
Oh, no, you don't.

18:47.423 --> 18:48.841
It's over.

18:49.008 --> 18:51.260
Not so tough without
a human host, huh?

18:51.427 --> 18:53.596
Let's make sure
you never find another.

18:59.101 --> 19:00.186
- Look!
- It's Spider-Man.

19:00.394 --> 19:02.605
- How's he do that?
- What's he doing here?

19:12.657 --> 19:14.950
- Hey.
- Whoa, where'd he go?

19:19.789 --> 19:22.792
Okay, you mooks, enough gawking.
Back to work.

19:27.296 --> 19:31.467
- Peter, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

19:31.634 --> 19:34.178
Well, come in, you big silly.

19:34.345 --> 19:37.056
I swung by the hospital. I mean...

19:37.223 --> 19:40.184
...I didn't actually swing,
I took a cab...

19:40.351 --> 19:41.894
...but you were already gone.

19:42.061 --> 19:44.188
Dr. Bromwell gave me a ride...

19:44.355 --> 19:47.316
...and made sure
I had everything I needed.

19:47.483 --> 19:50.236
You didn't go into the kitchen,
did you?

19:50.444 --> 19:53.531
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

19:57.076 --> 19:58.494
Happy Thanksgiving, Peter.

19:58.661 --> 20:01.247
Gwen, are you all right?
I mean, I heard--

20:01.455 --> 20:04.166
She insisted on coming.
Gave me the look.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.210
I'm fine.

20:06.377 --> 20:10.923
Well, not fine, but alive.

20:11.090 --> 20:14.927
Glad I started the turkey this morning,
before the post-traumatic stress.

20:15.094 --> 20:18.848
- Yeah, about the turkey, what's the--?
- Well, didn't your aunt tell you?

20:19.014 --> 20:22.727
She thought you might need
a little help in the kitchen.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.229
Maybe just a little.

20:38.117 --> 20:39.368
It's good.

20:39.535 --> 20:42.079
So how are you feeling, Aunt May?

20:42.246 --> 20:44.790
- If you're tired--
- I'm fine, Peter.

20:44.999 --> 20:47.543
And I wouldn't have missed this
for the world.

20:47.710 --> 20:50.379
I'm just thankful
Spider-Man saved my daughter.

20:50.546 --> 20:57.136
We do have a lot to give thanks for:
family, friends, relative good health.

20:57.303 --> 21:00.598
Of course, I am a tad disappointed
my hospital bill will wipe out...

21:00.765 --> 21:02.892
...the advance from
the publishing company.

21:03.058 --> 21:05.144
What publishing company?

21:05.311 --> 21:07.313
Why, the one publishing
my cookbook, dear.

21:07.521 --> 21:09.565
Of course, I'll have to write
a new one now.

21:09.732 --> 21:11.942
One that's a little more heart-smart.

21:12.109 --> 21:15.571
Do you think I can get an advance
on that one too?

21:17.281 --> 21:20.659
I feel so guilty leaving
poor Peter to clean up.

21:20.826 --> 21:24.497
Stop it. My mess, okay?

21:24.663 --> 21:26.665
<i>And speaking of messes...</i>

21:26.832 --> 21:30.085
<i>...maybe I do let people down a lot.</i>

21:30.252 --> 21:33.255
<i>But, hey, I'm always there
to save them too.</i>

21:35.174 --> 21:37.426
<i>Spidey's not a disease
that needs a cure.</i>

21:37.593 --> 21:39.845
<i>And he's more than just
a random bug bite too.</i>

21:40.346 --> 21:43.265
<i>Spider-Man is who I am.</i>

21:43.766 --> 21:44.809
<i>My destiny.</i>

21:48.103 --> 21:50.439
Oh, man.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.695
This was amazing, Gwen.

21:56.862 --> 21:58.364
You're amazing.

21:58.572 --> 22:01.283
- Thanks.
- No prob.

22:01.450 --> 22:05.329
Well, night.

22:14.463 --> 22:17.633
<i>We know who you love the most.</i>
