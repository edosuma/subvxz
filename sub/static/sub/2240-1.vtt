02:30.733 --> 02:32.025
Close your eyes.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.277
Close em.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.600
See how many you gotta go through...

03:05.977 --> 03:07.603
to get a good one?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.014
Are you ready?

03:45.808 --> 03:46.767
No.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.270
You can see what?

04:31.437 --> 04:32.688
Who's?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.315
Not till Monday.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.566
Whose is it?

04:47.996 --> 04:51.039
I don't know a grip, a gaffer,
somebody's foot, a shadow of it.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.834
I can't, I can't... okay well

04:54.002 --> 04:56.044
if I can see it then they can see it too.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.379
If they can't do it,

04:57.547 --> 04:59.131
I mean how many times are
you going to go around this?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.674
Hire a new team.
What's the problem?

05:00.842 --> 05:01.967
It has been a while.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.762
I'm sorry about that but
your work is just amazing.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.972
When we saw your take on it

05:07.015 --> 05:09.391
everyone instantly knew
we'd gone to the right place.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.685
I just have a few questions for you.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.566
Taking the yellow soil

05:30.872 --> 05:32.831
This was my daily work

05:34.751 --> 05:36.418
What is it?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.295
Do you have more?

05:38.463 --> 05:39.838
My friends, though.

07:58.686 --> 07:59.895
No, no.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.146
Stay awake.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.023
You feel refreshed?

08:05.526 --> 08:06.943
Is there any food?

08:07.111 --> 08:08.945
All the food is poisoned.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.114
Your throat is parched.

08:11.157 --> 08:15.118
Make a pitcher of ice
water, bring a small glass.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.169
You can leave the tile.

08:24.170 --> 08:28.131
The rest of the floor will
support your weight now.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.139
I have to apologize.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.183
I was born with a disfigurement
where my head is made

08:39.227 --> 08:41.227
of the same material as the sun.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.273
It makes it impossible for
you to look directly at me.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.193
It has always been this way.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.617
The water before you is somehow special.

08:55.785 --> 08:59.329
When you drink it you feel
revived and full of energy.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.749
It is better than anything you've ever tasted.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.251
Take a drink now.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.595
There are two approaching
armies, hunger and fatigue,

09:15.763 --> 09:18.223
but a great wall keeps them at bay.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.642
The wall extends to the sky and will stay

09:20.810 --> 09:23.645
up until I say otherwise.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.359
Each drink is better than the last,

09:29.527 --> 09:32.571
leaving you with the desire to have one more.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.993
Take a drink now.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.931
The next drink must be earned
and I'm going to tell you how.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.268
Focus closely on my instructions.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.979
I will ask you to repeat them from memory.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.295
One one thousand, two one thousand,

10:30.379 --> 10:32.380
three one thousand, four one thousand.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.345
The water has lost its appeal.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.889
It doesn't seem as enticing as before.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.100
You have no craving for it.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.812
Kris I just got a call.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.438
It's your mother.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.982
She says she's been taken by several men.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.359
Oh no.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.488
She says they won't let
her go unless you pay them.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.992
No...

11:43.160 --> 11:46.371
Oh no. Do you have any money?

11:46.414 --> 11:47.872
No I don't.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.541
I'm sorry.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.043
Can you think of anything?

11:52.461 --> 11:55.004
She sounds brave but I
think they're hurting her.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.798
Mom...

11:59.093 --> 12:00.385
I have the house.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.011
You own the house?

12:02.179 --> 12:04.139
I own part of it.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.682
I could, maybe I could...

12:05.850 --> 12:07.225
What's the equity?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.602
$36,000.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.231
Is that enough?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.734
In coins?

12:16.694 --> 12:18.319
Coins?

12:54.815 --> 12:56.691
Five thousand.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.779
Forty-five hundred.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.782
Three thousand.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.457
Weather is beautiful.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.043
You feel like walking a bit
so you park a block away.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.468
Did I hand you back your card?
There we are.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.719
Current balance is at the bottom.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.388
Please allow 3-4 business days
for availability of funds.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.556
Is there anything else I can help you with?

13:28.724 --> 13:29.766
No thank you, that's it.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.476
Thank you for stopping in
Ms. Fischer, have a great...

13:38.484 --> 13:39.984
Yes ma'am, how may I help you?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.320
Who can I speak to about a
home equity line of credit?

13:42.488 --> 13:43.488
I can help you with that.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.489
My name is Marie, please have a seat.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.491
Oh I love your scarf.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.494
Over...

13:50.955 --> 13:54.958
and under, through and now you're white.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.428
Crown me.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.018
One one thousand, two one thousand,

14:14.186 --> 14:16.521
three one thousand, four one thousand

15:31.847 --> 15:36.726
Kris, the wall has crumbled, fallen down.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.126
It won't come out.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.652
And did you try anybody else?

28:16.820 --> 28:18.320
Because I spoke to Shelly

28:18.363 --> 28:19.905
and she does not remember talking to you.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.573
Yes, it was a voicemail, I left a voicemail.

28:21.741 --> 28:22.783
Where's Roth today?

28:22.951 --> 28:24.159
Why isn't he telling me himself?

28:24.327 --> 28:26.870
He couldn't be here today
and that's now what we're...

28:27.038 --> 28:29.373
I had the flu, okay?

28:29.374 --> 28:31.709
I had a 106 degree temperature.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.940
That's not... that's
not my signature.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.942
I didn't... it's not...

29:00.405 --> 29:02.573
And here's a deposit slip from September.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.408
Yeah, that's my handwriting.

29:04.409 --> 29:07.119
This is different obviously.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.271
So we do all their
printing and their literature.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.481
It's just a small school district but,

30:59.524 --> 31:01.525
this is the address right here,

31:01.693 --> 31:04.361
so if you ever need any printing, signage,

31:04.529 --> 31:05.529
just come in or call.

31:05.655 --> 31:06.947
I don't need... I never in a
million years would I ever...

31:07.115 --> 31:08.323
I don't need any signage.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.491
This is you, Kris?

31:09.534 --> 31:10.158
Yeah, that's me.

31:10.326 --> 31:11.034
Okay.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.494
Umm...

31:12.537 --> 31:14.246
I'll call.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.540
I'm not going to call for signage though, right?

31:16.583 --> 31:18.667
I don't need any signage.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.044
Okay, Kris?

31:21.212 --> 31:22.754
Okay, Jeff.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.426
Uh, hey...

31:28.845 --> 31:30.679
it was good meeting you.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.605
I called you.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.733
I can't do this every day.
This makes me late for work.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.610
You're four trains after me.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.114
So you're going to have to answer if I call.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.618
I'm going to call. Again.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.625
I picked up an MBA.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.585
That's what the, that's what the firm does.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.964
It has a commercial half, the
other side's personal wealth.

32:47.131 --> 32:47.756
Where is it?

32:47.924 --> 32:50.592
It's, you can actually see it.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.635
It's a high rise.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.638
The Palomar Building, C&L Crowne, that's us.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.723
Why do you take the train?

32:56.891 --> 32:57.849
Why do I take the train?

32:58.017 --> 32:59.226
Yes, it's just everyone

32:59.394 --> 33:00.644
that takes the train is either homeless

33:00.770 --> 33:03.021
or had their license revoked or you know.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.648
Do you want to see my driver's license?

33:04.691 --> 33:05.649
No.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.653
That's a gift for us.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.281
See there's this path forward
where I wait to tell you

33:13.449 --> 33:15.659
and you either use it as an excuse

33:15.702 --> 33:18.578
or maybe you don't but, I don't know.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.665
I was diagnosed about a
year ago and I take these

33:21.833 --> 33:24.376
and I take those and it's fine.

33:24.544 --> 33:25.961
It seems fine.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.379
It seems fine to me.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.672
So there's that, and...

33:28.715 --> 33:31.425
I think I saved us both three to four weeks.

33:31.592 --> 33:32.551
Alright.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.094
Thank you.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.680
I'm going to get the check and we can...

33:37.640 --> 33:40.559
...get out of here.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.686
I'm sorry.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.813
That was stupid.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.858
I don't know what I'm meant to say to that.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.109
What do I say to that?

33:49.277 --> 33:50.318
I don't know.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.244
Why don't I-I'll tell
you something and then you,

33:59.412 --> 34:02.122
you don't care at all do you?

34:02.290 --> 34:03.707
It's not- yeah alright.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.711
Before we pass this trash I'm
going to tell you something.

34:14.886 --> 34:15.719
Um...

34:15.887 --> 34:17.721
I am divorced.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.723
That's not good right?

34:19.849 --> 34:20.724
It's not great.

34:20.891 --> 34:21.933
Yeah.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.967
Where's Michel?

34:56.135 --> 34:58.345
We have clients with ten times this revenue

34:58.513 --> 34:59.971
that don't have near the tax liability you do.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.599
So we can have another conversation about

35:02.767 --> 35:04.059
how screwed up the code is,

35:04.227 --> 35:07.062
or you can take the charge against and solve it.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.490
Does your wife take any medications?

41:34.283 --> 41:35.158
No.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.910
Does she have any health problems?

41:37.077 --> 41:37.869
Asthma.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.691
Just want to say that I hope today's better.

42:10.736 --> 42:13.446
I made a list of the things
I want to try harder at.

42:16.116 --> 42:17.200
I love you.

42:17.743 --> 42:20.286
Those are just words,
they don't fix anything Jill.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.630
It's not a short I'm going to
the store to get some more.

42:31.590 --> 42:32.507
Wait a second.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.217
I'm on the way out the door.

42:34.343 --> 42:37.220
I just want to tell you I hope today is better.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.722
And that I love you.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.933
Damn it Jill those are just, those are words.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.643
They don't mean anything.

42:43.811 --> 42:44.769
Not now Jillian.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.062
I want this to be a good day.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.230
Just leave me alone.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.232
I love you.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.777
I think you were right about a lot of things.

42:53.237 --> 42:54.404
I love you.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.573
I want today to be peaceful.

42:57.783 --> 42:59.909
Damn it Jill, this is worthless.

43:03.497 --> 43:04.372
Ben.

43:04.540 --> 43:05.456
Now you want to talk?

43:05.624 --> 43:06.958
I'm way out the door Jill.

43:08.961 --> 43:09.877
I just want to say that...

43:10.045 --> 43:11.963
...I hope today is better.

43:12.631 --> 43:14.340
And that I love you.

43:14.508 --> 43:16.884
I want to believe you.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.731
Hey, while I'm at it I'll pick up that filter.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.750
Is it alright that I have that there?

45:12.918 --> 45:14.794
You going to fall down
if you don't have it there?

45:14.962 --> 45:16.587
Yeah, maybe.

45:21.885 --> 45:24.095
See this woman here with the knitting?

45:25.389 --> 45:28.391
She's a, she's a former Senator, right?

45:28.434 --> 45:32.145
Like a Nobel winner, but
her category is mittens.

45:32.730 --> 45:35.106
So she, she rides... what?

45:35.274 --> 45:35.898
You lost me.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.233
Just got a little too...

45:37.401 --> 45:37.942
Little?

45:38.110 --> 45:39.485
[Kris÷ Little cute, yeah.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.404
I don't know.
What do you have in mind?

45:41.447 --> 45:44.240
Alright, how about that guy?

45:44.408 --> 45:46.117
Tell me about him.

45:46.285 --> 45:48.619
He's divorced.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.539
Yeah, yep.

45:51.707 --> 45:54.625
Because she cheated.

45:55.544 --> 45:56.711
No?

45:57.504 --> 45:59.338
No. Oh, he did.

45:59.423 --> 46:00.423
He cheated.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.842
No. What was it?

46:03.010 --> 46:04.427
Alcoholic.

46:09.433 --> 46:12.935
Some substance of some kind.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.439
The illegal kind.

46:19.151 --> 46:20.735
I would think that there's some marriages

46:20.903 --> 46:23.404
that could survive something like that maybe.

46:23.447 --> 46:24.739
Maybe, but...

46:24.907 --> 46:25.740
Not yours?

46:25.908 --> 46:27.533
Not ours, no.

46:27.701 --> 46:29.494
From her perspective.

46:29.828 --> 46:32.455
I mean everything just flipped, you know.

46:32.456 --> 46:35.249
The guy she thought she married
turned out to be somebody else,

46:35.417 --> 46:37.460
a junkie, and uh...

46:37.628 --> 46:40.963
all the savings, all
the plans, everything resets.

46:41.131 --> 46:42.965
The lights turn on,

46:43.133 --> 46:46.135
and I'm holed up in some hotel across town.

46:49.473 --> 46:52.225
I have to open the store tomorrow.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.645
Not that early, I bet.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.481
No, I'm lucky to have that job.

46:59.274 --> 47:02.527
The sign store job you're lucky to have it?

47:07.491 --> 47:10.159
It's not my fault when it goes wrong.

47:13.205 --> 47:14.580
Yes it is.

49:30.634 --> 49:32.802
Why do you live in hotels?

49:32.970 --> 49:37.181
I do the books for a group
that owns a few of them.

49:37.349 --> 49:39.976
So it's sort of... a perk.

49:40.143 --> 49:41.435
Right, but why do you choose...

49:41.603 --> 49:42.812
I am starving...
Are you hungry?

49:42.980 --> 49:44.522
You've got to be right?

49:47.651 --> 49:49.944
It always just reminds me of family vacations.

49:51.029 --> 49:53.447
Maybe because of the smell of chlorine

49:53.615 --> 49:54.949
and bleach in the sheets,

49:55.117 --> 49:57.785
the glasses wrapped in plastic.

49:59.454 --> 50:00.496
Yeah...

50:00.664 --> 50:02.832
We would go to this...
there's this place in Vermont

50:03.000 --> 50:04.667
that we would go when we were kids.

50:04.668 --> 50:05.960
It's like a colonial...

50:06.128 --> 50:07.503
In Vermont?

50:07.671 --> 50:08.462
Yeah.

50:08.630 --> 50:11.590
It was historic and there was museums,

50:11.675 --> 50:13.676
but the thing that stood out for
us was that they...

50:13.719 --> 50:16.470
we would stay at this hotel with an indoor pool,

50:16.638 --> 50:20.641
and it was just the biggest
deal in the world for us.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.685
Because one, it's indoor...

50:23.687 --> 50:26.647
Two, you can swim... What's
going on with you?

50:30.485 --> 50:32.236
What are you thinking?

50:34.865 --> 50:35.698
Is it good?

50:35.866 --> 50:37.450
No.

51:20.118 --> 51:22.369
You have a message.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.706
Are you going?

51:26.541 --> 51:28.000
To the banquet?

51:30.253 --> 51:32.171
I mean it's going to be work, you know.

51:32.339 --> 51:33.923
It's people from work.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.591
For three hours.

51:40.555 --> 51:42.098
I thought we could go...

51:42.474 --> 51:43.682
...if you want.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.480
You want to?

51:57.447 --> 51:59.447
I'm sorry.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.631
I like you so much.

52:15.799 --> 52:18.676
I do. I like you so much.

52:19.803 --> 52:20.219
I have...

52:20.387 --> 52:21.804
You are kidding right?

52:21.847 --> 52:25.891
I have been really careful
not to lie about something.

52:26.810 --> 52:28.811
And through omission,

52:29.521 --> 52:30.813
I may have given you an impression

52:30.981 --> 52:33.816
that isn't quite real.

52:33.859 --> 52:35.526
I work here.

52:35.694 --> 52:38.737
I work on 29th C&L Crowne.

52:38.864 --> 52:40.447
I'm not an advisor.

52:40.615 --> 52:41.824
I don't broker.

52:42.409 --> 52:46.036
I do interdepartmental reports,
okay, I don't have an office.

52:46.204 --> 52:48.247
I work in common space, I work with interns.

52:48.790 --> 52:50.833
Greg pays me in cash to keep me off their books

52:50.834 --> 52:55.838
because if there is ever
an audit, I am a liability.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.258
I stole money, Kris.

53:00.844 --> 53:03.220
Shifted it from account to account,

53:03.388 --> 53:04.471
until I could grab it.

53:04.639 --> 53:05.764
Right, because if you...

53:05.849 --> 53:07.099
I lost my broker's license...

53:07.851 --> 53:09.226
and they covered for me.

53:09.394 --> 53:11.979
But if I was anybody else I would be in prison.

53:12.147 --> 53:14.106
So I am lucky to have this job.

53:16.818 --> 53:18.152
When you walk into that hotel...

53:18.612 --> 53:19.820
you're going to know.

53:19.863 --> 53:21.864
When you walk into that
banquet, you're going to know.

53:21.948 --> 53:23.824
Because everybody there knows.

53:23.867 --> 53:25.242
And they look at me in a certain way,

53:25.410 --> 53:27.077
and they talk to me in a certain way.

53:27.245 --> 53:29.496
In a way that you don't look at me yet.

53:32.626 --> 53:33.626
That was smart.

53:36.963 --> 53:39.506
To wait to tell me.

53:43.678 --> 53:44.845
I'm sorry.

53:49.976 --> 53:51.852
Think you might be using that wrong.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.315
Which direction is this?
Is that east?

53:57.567 --> 53:59.818
You can see the whole city from up here.

54:22.842 --> 54:24.927
I think I might be pregnant.

54:52.747 --> 54:53.831
Won't let anyone near them.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.042
They just crowd back in the corner.

54:58.128 --> 54:59.086
Violent.

54:59.254 --> 55:01.171
Oh yes, she's got a litter on the way.

55:01.339 --> 55:02.965
They can get very protective.

55:03.049 --> 55:05.467
Never seen the parents behave so.

55:05.969 --> 55:08.470
Just never had them break my damn fence.

55:08.638 --> 55:10.723
There's a fellow down the
road buys them from me.

55:10.890 --> 55:12.975
Well, if you need another buyer,
I know some petting farms.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.143
They'd love to have some piglets.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.062
Okay, sure, sure, thanks so much.

55:20.233 --> 55:22.693
First off, you're not pregnant.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.945
No, I did a test. I am.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.489
The HCG in your blood tells us you're not.

55:27.657 --> 55:28.991
And that's more definitive.

55:29.075 --> 55:31.160
Okay.

55:31.328 --> 55:34.705
Now, you didn't list it in your
questionnaire, but...

55:34.873 --> 55:38.125
have you had any surgical
procedures in your pelvic area?

55:38.293 --> 55:41.211
Maybe a cyst was removed or a biopsy?

55:47.344 --> 55:48.844
I'd say post cancer.

55:49.012 --> 55:52.014
This is where they removed
the tumor, this cavity.

55:53.767 --> 55:54.767
She says no.

55:54.934 --> 55:55.809
No what?

55:55.977 --> 55:57.644
Someone was in there.

55:58.313 --> 56:00.856
Trauma here, and...

56:01.024 --> 56:02.941
How are you supposed to help someone like that?

56:54.369 --> 56:56.829
By all appearances you're a survivor

56:56.996 --> 56:59.456
of stage three endometrial cancer.

56:59.624 --> 57:01.500
The good news is that there isn't any sign

57:01.668 --> 57:03.419
of any remaining carcinoma.

57:04.671 --> 57:07.047
Lab shows that you're in no immediate danger.

57:08.675 --> 57:12.052
The trauma it left behind is significant.

57:14.097 --> 57:16.098
Well, I'm saying two things.

57:16.683 --> 57:19.101
It is highly unlikely given
the state of the organs

57:19.102 --> 57:21.812
that you could ever become pregnant.

57:23.106 --> 57:25.858
If by some miracle you were to conceive,

57:26.025 --> 57:28.652
the faculties are too damaged
to carry a baby full term.

57:46.087 --> 57:48.130
Wait, wait, wait.
Pull over here.

57:49.883 --> 57:50.841
Krissy?

57:52.010 --> 57:54.052
Krissy? Krissy!

57:54.137 --> 57:54.887
Where'd you go?

57:55.054 --> 57:55.888
Something happened to me...

57:56.055 --> 57:56.722
I was looking for you!

57:56.890 --> 57:58.140
Something bad happened to me.

57:58.141 --> 57:59.141
I know that, I don't care.

57:59.184 --> 58:00.267
No you don't know!

58:00.435 --> 58:01.435
I don't even know what happened.

58:01.603 --> 58:02.352
I can't see my niece and nephews and...

58:02.520 --> 58:03.770
Kris, why?

58:03.938 --> 58:05.355
Why? What are you talking about?

58:05.523 --> 58:06.148
I have to go there.

58:06.316 --> 58:07.316
Okay, listen to me.

58:07.484 --> 58:08.984
I want to, I want to marry you.

58:09.152 --> 58:10.152
I'm married to you right now.

58:10.278 --> 58:11.153
I need a car.

58:11.279 --> 58:12.446
I'm marrying you, today.
Do you understand?

58:15.074 --> 58:16.283
Yes. We'll get a car.

58:16.451 --> 58:18.118
Today.

58:24.083 --> 58:25.876
Do you know this place?

58:30.048 --> 58:31.590
I want to say yes.

58:32.425 --> 58:33.175
For you.

58:33.343 --> 58:34.927
I want to.

58:35.220 --> 58:39.056
Is there, is there a direction that you feel

58:39.307 --> 58:41.099
that you're more drawn to?

58:41.184 --> 58:42.726
I don't know.
Is there one you feel drawn to?

58:44.187 --> 58:45.729
I say right.

58:46.231 --> 58:47.314
Left.

58:48.191 --> 58:48.815
You sure?

58:48.983 --> 58:49.650
No.

58:50.485 --> 58:52.152
Then let's go right.

58:52.445 --> 58:54.154
I'm going to go wherever you go.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.324
You know that.

58:59.202 --> 59:01.203
I feel like you know.

59:12.298 --> 59:14.216
We should go on a trip.

59:16.719 --> 59:17.886
Get somewhere.

59:18.346 --> 59:19.972
Where would we go?

59:20.139 --> 59:22.307
Somewhere bright.

59:29.774 --> 59:31.191
They could be starlings.

59:31.234 --> 59:33.193
They could be starlings.

59:33.236 --> 59:36.071
When I was little, my
friend Renny would come over

59:36.239 --> 59:37.239
and I'd get really mad

59:37.365 --> 59:39.241
because every time my Mom would bake cookies...

59:39.242 --> 59:40.367
I knew a kid called Renny...

59:40.535 --> 59:41.743
...he'd eat them all.

59:41.911 --> 59:42.953
...this fat kid

59:43.121 --> 59:45.038
He was fat, my neighbor Renny.

59:45.206 --> 59:46.415
I told you this story

59:46.583 --> 59:47.666
Is lunch ready?

59:50.253 --> 59:52.754
Doesn't it look an improvement?

59:54.966 --> 59:56.592
It's much better.

59:57.010 --> 59:58.385
Much better right?

59:58.553 --> 59:59.511
I guess so.

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.597
Who said that?

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:02.764
Who said that?

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.182
Who said they were Grackles?

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.267
Grackles.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.268
They could be starlings.

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:07.269
They could be starlings.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.271
So I was really excited to go swimming.

01:00:09.355 --> 01:00:10.272
Yeah.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.315
And he didn't even have a chance to tell me

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:12.858
that there was bird shit all over the slide,

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.276
so I went down anyway.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.402
Wait.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.278
Renny.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:16.778
Right.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:17.988
My neighbor.

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:19.406
You're tell- you're
doing it again.

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:20.574
You're doing it again.

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:22.367
The kid almost drowned me.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.749
We should go on a trip.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.627
Get somewhere.

01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:36.590
Where would we go?

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.300
To Vermont?

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:42.012
That place that you know?

01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:43.847
Maybe.

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:49.311
How do you get there?

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.147
Renny used to come over and eat
all the chocolate chip cookies

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:53.315
No, no, no I'm talking about a different one.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.608
Renny is my friend.

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:55.734
With the pool and the slide.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:58.111
With the pool and tried to drown me, yes,

01:00:58.279 --> 01:01:00.906
I tell you a story and then you've taken it

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:03.325
and you've made it your own,
you do this all the time.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.118
How do you get there?

01:01:05.286 --> 01:01:08.497
The place where you and your family you'd go

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.374
on vacation in Vermont?

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.125
You drive Kris.

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:14.086
What road would you take?

01:01:14.253 --> 01:01:15.337
I would have to get a map.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:17.005
You don't remember?

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.091
It's just some country road.

01:01:19.258 --> 01:01:20.425
I was six.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:24.137
No I was six.

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:25.347
I told you that story.

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:26.973
No you didn't, no.

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:28.558
Yes, he held me under remember,

01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:29.976
he held me under water.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:33.355
So I'm not allowed to talk about my childhood?

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.940
Talk all you want, just don't talk about mine.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:35.857
You think it's your childhood?

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:36.900
What about the trampoline?

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.276
With Mick?

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.152
No, that's you, that's yours.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.362
That's me, thank you for that.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:40.987
What about Renny?

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:41.530
No.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:42.364
Almost drowned me?

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:43.573
Then lied to my mom about it?

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:44.449
No that's mine.

01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:45.534
That's you, right, okay

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:46.535
That happened to me!

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:47.953
Kris!

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:50.247
Not only that but you're also
trying to tell me that

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.382
They could be starlings.

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:03.301
They could be starlings.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.774
Ring.

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.722
where are you?

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.890
I don't know.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.475
I can't find them anywhere.

01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:44.476
Can't find who?
Where are you?

01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:45.810
I know they're here.

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:46.853
I can feel them here.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:47.896
I can't find them.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.731
I've been looking everywhere for them.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.357
Are there three windows?

01:07:51.525 --> 01:07:51.900
Yeah.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:52.650
Two doors?

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:53.359
Uh huh.

01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:54.694
Go in the one on the right.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.821
It's just a room.

01:07:56.989 --> 01:07:57.864
No it's a passage.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:00.032
Go to the other side you're going through.

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:02.577
Now what?

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:03.953
- You in the room
- Yes.

01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:05.288
- Is there a chair on the right?
- Yes.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:06.748
Fire extinguishers yes?

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:07.749
Yeah.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:08.750
There should be a door in front of you,

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.043
a gray door, go through that.

01:08:11.003 --> 01:08:12.337
Go past the columns then

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:13.463
look for a door on the left,

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:14.339
the next one, the next one.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:15.757
Go down two flights of stairs.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.883
Take the elevator.

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:24.515
Come on let's go.

01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:26.059
Why were you at my work?

01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:28.685
I didn't know I was.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.773
What are we doing?
Where are we going, home?

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.651
Kris? Where are we going, home?

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.361
Kris, home?

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.904
Yeah, home.

01:13:04.004 --> 01:13:05.046
"Oh husband," replied his wife.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:07.256
Do you hear that?

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.050
Hear what?

01:13:10.135 --> 01:13:11.469
There's like a...

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:15.598
There's this sound coming
from underneath the house.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:22.772
I don't hear anything.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.065
It's really high pitched.

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.484
You're scaring me a little bit.

01:13:37.871 --> 01:13:39.288
Kris, it's an old house.

01:13:39.456 --> 01:13:41.165
There's nine things in this
house that sound like that.

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:43.501
Can you just, can you just
go in there, just go in there

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:44.460
I'm going to go in.

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:45.378
Thank you.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:47.088
I haven't slept at all.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.507
I'm sorry. It's really...

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.843
You don't believe me.
I'm not lying.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.094
I may have...

01:13:53.345 --> 01:13:55.054
I think I...

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.600
There's a weird flowing sound.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:03.062
Right through the main, whatever this thing is.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.105
The pipe.

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:07.692
But it's not what you're doing.
It's like low.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.610
You know what I'm saying?

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.321
It's both, it's both those sounds.

01:14:12.489 --> 01:14:14.699
It's both low and high at the same time.

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:15.908
No.

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:17.118
Yeah.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:17.994
No, you...

01:14:19.913 --> 01:14:22.623
Yeah, it's like a low and high.

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:26.836
It's like low and high.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.902
Kris?

01:17:04.828 --> 01:17:07.288
What are you doing here?

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.498
I love to be alone.

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:12.543
You love what?

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.307
The sun is but a morning star.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.517
What'd you say?

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.529
The wildest sound ever
heard makes the woods ring far

01:17:40.697 --> 01:17:42.323
and wide.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:18:00.424
Faint tinkling sounds borne to my ear.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.432
Their roots reaching quite under the house.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.564
Fearing that they
would be light-headed.

01:18:15.732 --> 01:18:17.775
For want of food and also sleep.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.235
Light-headed?

01:18:23.323 --> 01:18:27.159
Prevailing blue mixed with yellow of the sand.

01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:29.704
Sunshine is the color of the water.

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:33.374
I used to wonder at the halo
of light around my shadow

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.335
And fancied myself one of the elect.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:47.698
Economy.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:52.828
When I wrote the following pages, or rather,

01:19:52.996 --> 01:19:54.246
the bulk of them

01:19:54.414 --> 01:19:58.542
I lived alone in the woods, a
mile from any neighbor,

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:01.003
in a house which I had
built myself, on the shore

01:20:01.713 --> 01:20:03.464
on the shore of Walden Pond.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:10.596
And earned my living
by the labor of my hands only.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.892
I lived there for two years and two months.

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.771
At present I am a sojourner
of civilized life again.

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:25.486
He heard a low and distant sound.

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:26.904
But grand, and impressive.

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:28.823
Unlike anything he had ever heard.

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.491
Gradually swelling and increasing.

01:20:30.575 --> 01:20:34.119
As if it would have a
universal and memorable ending.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.497
Asullen rush and roar.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.669
The rays which stream through the shutter

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.295
will be no longer remembered

01:20:43.463 --> 01:20:44.505
when the shutter is wholly removed.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:48.509
The finest qualities of our nature,

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:51.011
like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved.

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.222
A stream flowing out in that direction

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.723
through a wooded valley.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.600
But stream there was none.

01:20:56.768 --> 01:20:58.936
I am glad to have drunk water so long.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.522
For the same reason that
