00:47.714 --> 00:48.794
Nick, grab the boat line.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.918
You're gonna tie off.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.131
I can't see
the boat anymore.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.718
They're out past the break.
They'll come back for us.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.139
What then?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.267
No one's that far ahead.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.308
Come on.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.783
Go take care of him.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.059
Strand.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.344
Boat's unloaded.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.305
Strand.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.192
- That's unfortunate.
- Hey, we need to go back.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.228
No, you need to go back because we are
about to have a number of uninvited guests.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.275
No, you need to go back because we are
about to have a number of uninvited guests.

01:56.324 --> 01:59.282
The Abigail can survive
on the sea for a long time.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.488
Others will covet that.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.366
They will covet that.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.448
Point the launch towards land
like I showed you. Go!

02:06.459 --> 02:08.120
Point the launch towards land
like I showed you. Go!

02:23.059 --> 02:25.345
- Travis.
- Oh, Jesus, Maddy.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.023
Chris!

02:35.864 --> 02:37.274
Chris, move to the water.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.780
- I can't.
-Chris/

02:39.868 --> 02:41.199
I'm not leaving her!

02:42.829 --> 02:44.911
- Travis.
- Chris--

02:48.001 --> 02:49.662
Travis!

03:08.688 --> 03:10.098
Maddy, watch out!

03:32.962 --> 03:34.338
Come on!

03:34.380 --> 03:36.587
Let's go!
Let's go!

03:39.636 --> 03:41.046
Go.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.565
Come on!
Come on!

03:58.988 --> 03:59.898
Dad!

03:59.989 --> 04:00.978
Come on!

04:18.841 --> 04:21.127
Oh, no. Ugh.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.747
Well done, Nick.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.430
Careful.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.601
Once the winch is set,
there's a switch inside the trunk.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.308
Shouldn't you be on the bridge?

06:39.357 --> 06:41.063
The boat will tell me
if there's an obstacle.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.765
How far can it take us?

06:42.860 --> 06:45.351
3,000 miles, more
if we don't stress the engines.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.566
That'll give us options.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.607
Sure, we can make it
all the way to El Salvador.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.283
We can survive on the Abigail
for quite some time.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.199
Mayday!

07:38.291 --> 07:40.532
- Oh, God.
-Mayday!

07:40.585 --> 07:41.916
What are we gonna do?

07:42.003 --> 07:43.914
Mom?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.462
- Go get Travis.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.380
Strand, stop the boat.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.340
That's funny.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.176
There are people out there we can help.
They'll drown.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.723
Then they should
return to land.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.675
We're too far out.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.516
There's nothing to go back to.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.771
Don't do this.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.769
I filled my mercy quota.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.851
Seven people saved to date.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.147
Seven people saved to date.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.694
Be thankful.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.280
- We need a doctor!

08:16.370 --> 08:18.656
- We got company.
- Oh, shit.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.574
- Where's Madison?
- She's talking to Strand.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.912
We got to get
these people.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.082
We're gonna
help them, right?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.711
Right now help us.
Inside there's a radio.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.546
Listen to the channels.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.587
We got to get a track on where
we can go that's safe, okay?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.221
What about these people?

08:37.308 --> 08:39.765
I'm gonna talk to Strand.
If you could do that for us...

08:39.852 --> 08:41.388
Right now, go.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.442
We have to stay away from the coast,
stay away from other people,

08:53.491 --> 08:55.152
stay away from the other boats.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.983
- What then?
- South.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.739
- We circle down to San Diego.
- Travis, there's a boat--

08:58.829 --> 09:00.490
Marines at Pendleton.
Navy at Coronado.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.747
Border Patrol.
If they held the line anywhere--

09:02.792 --> 09:04.328
- The military are not gonna help us.
- You prefer the alternative?

09:04.418 --> 09:06.454
Stop the goddamn boat.
That's the alternative.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.495
If I stop the boat,
it'll be to drop folks off,

09:08.506 --> 09:09.541
If I stop the boat,
it'll be to drop folks off,

09:09.590 --> 09:11.330
not take them on.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.298
We can't stop, Maddy.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.970
It's not safe.

09:28.901 --> 09:29.936
Mom, what happened?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.234
Ask your new friend.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.821
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.364
This is the Summer Wind.
We 're taking on water--

09:37.451 --> 09:39.737
There '8 another boat.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.573
They're boarding and / don 't know
what they're gonna do.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.533
...peop/e on the cliff. People are jumping.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.784
They got hurt
and won 't wake up.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.838
I saw his head go away.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.261
It just went away.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.697
This is Coast Guard Station LALB.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.778
We have no assistance
to provide.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.534
I repeat, there is no rescue by sea,

10:22.580 --> 10:24.536
land or by air.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.698
There '8 nothing.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.537
Forgive us.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.713
Ahoy.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.143
I think you
should have stopped.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.063
We had this conversation
in the pens.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.311
Was I not clear?

10:53.402 --> 10:55.188
This was different.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.861
I'm sorry you feel that way.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.577
So, what if San Diego doesn't work?

11:09.627 --> 11:11.288
I don't know.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.086
The whole world
is I don't know right now.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.093
You should be used to that.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.732
Let's find you someplace to sleep.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.393
It's not happening.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.068
You've been up all night.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.864
So have you.
So has everyone.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.241
No one's slept.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.195
What are you doing?

11:47.289 --> 11:48.870
Travis told me
to do this.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.417
We don't even know
where we're going.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.662
We're heading south.
San Diego.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.252
Or so it seems.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.330
Okay, and you know
that's safe how?

11:57.341 --> 11:58.376
Okay, and you know
that's safe how?

12:01.637 --> 12:03.252
Right.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.679
Let-- just let me.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.932
Let me do this.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.759
Please?

12:14.984 --> 12:16.440
Okay.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.314
l'll sleep soon.
I promise.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.656
He's just sitting in there
staring at her body.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.867
I don't know what to do.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.165
There's nothing to do.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.626
Maddy, look at me.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.045
I know you wanted
to help those people.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.502
How many
did we leave behind?

12:44.597 --> 12:47.054
You think
that was easy for me?

12:47.141 --> 12:48.472
But look at us.
Look at where we are.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.765
We're on this boat
with no supplies,

12:49.810 --> 12:51.721
no concrete plan.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.762
We got an old man, a hurt woman,
scared kids, and a corpse.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.888
We got an old man, a hurt woman,
scared kids, and a corpse.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.431
You think bringing those people
on board this ship is saving them?

12:57.526 --> 12:59.938
I think about Matt.
I think about our neighbors.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.524
- I think about them, too.
- Yeah, I can't do that anymore.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.606
- I can't live with that.
- So, what if those people were sick?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.732
- I can't live with that.
- So, what if those people were sick?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.151
What if they
were infected?

13:08.245 --> 13:10.236
We don't know.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.913
And we're no good to anyone
if we can't take care of our own family.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.744
That's who we have
to hold on to, Maddy.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.659
You, Alicia, Nick, Chris.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.452
l have to protect my son.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.754
That's what it has to be.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.382
- I need you with me.
- I am.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.961
- Negative on that.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.848
-Negative on that.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.600
...seen anybody for days. Over.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.679
We have no food,
we have no water.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.708
Hello?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.493
Hello?

13:59.588 --> 14:01.579
Is there anybody out there?
Anyone alive?

14:01.590 --> 14:03.046
Is there anybody out there?
Anyone alive?

14:04.593 --> 14:06.584
We're alive, man.
Barely.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.927
We're alive, man.
Barely.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.964
The end of the world's
got me super nostalgic.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.636
The end of the world's
got me super nostalgic.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.887
Give me a shout-out
if you dig this tune.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.435
ls someone there?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.521
ls someone there?

14:26.532 --> 14:27.817
ls someone there?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.779
You're not gonna get this song
out of your head now.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.828
And you're welcome.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.125
You're shy.
That's cool.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.077
Doesn't seem much point
to that now,

14:42.131 --> 14:44.167
but, yeah, I get it.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.873
I understand.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.210
Come on,
please talk to me.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.086
Come on,
please talk to me.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.172
Please say something.
Just say something.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.593
Please say something.
Just say something.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.280
I'm sorry.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.234
Cool?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.086
Your father taught you?

16:47.131 --> 16:49.213
In a lake.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.381
Not like this.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.301
Big Bear
when l was a kid.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.017
So what do we catch
out here?

17:03.063 --> 17:05.395
Depends.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.473
Calico bass.
Yellowtail.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.599
Calico bass.
Yellowtail.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.401
Rockfish.
Whitefish.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.034
Sorry about your mother.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.163
Sorry about your wife.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.371
Yeah.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.133
Neither of us
got to say good-bye.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.963
It would have not
made a difference.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.017
Eel. Not pretty,
but the meat is good.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.393
Eel. Not pretty,
but the meat is good.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.944
Whoa. Sorry.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.358
Uh...

18:01.330 --> 18:03.321
Hey, do you want help
with your bandage?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.697
Hey, do you want help
with your bandage?

18:04.792 --> 18:06.874
That doesn't look so good.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.042
Liza said it would take
some time to heal.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.079
I'm actually pretty good
with that stuff.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.125
I'm actually pretty good
with that stuff.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.884
I can manage.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.755
Okay.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.837
Hey, if you put ointment
directly on the pad,

18:19.848 --> 18:22.180
Hey, if you put ointment
directly on the pad,

18:22.226 --> 18:23.841
then cover it,
it hurts less.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.927
- Thanks.
- And ice is good for the pain.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.519
- Thanks.
- And ice is good for the pain.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.983
And vodka.
Lots of vodka.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.825
The boat got knocked around.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.400
When we left the marina,
everyone kind of lost their minds.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.201
Is it your brother's boat?

18:43.247 --> 18:45.329
Yeah, he's got
this shitty little boat,

18:45.374 --> 18:47.365
but he ﬁshes out of Pedro,
him and our cousin.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.786
but he ﬁshes out of Pedro,
him and our cousin.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.868
Is it safe there
where you are now?

18:50.879 --> 18:51.914
Is it safe there
where you are now?

18:52.005 --> 18:54.291
/ think so.
We found a cove.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.081
It's just, you know,
we don 't have food

18:56.135 --> 18:57.375
and the ﬁsh
aren't biting.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.050
Where is it?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.257
It's, um-- I don 't know.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.016
I don 't know
if/ should say.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.769
I'm sorry.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.848
No, it's fine.
I understand.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.019
No, it's fine.
I understand.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.901
So, where were you
when it happened?

19:17.447 --> 19:18.983
Um...

19:21.285 --> 19:22.866
You okay?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.325
It's just not fair.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.495
Alicia ?

19:32.379 --> 19:35.121
It was over before
I knew it started.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.207
It was all over.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.304
I'm sorry.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.722
Have you lost anyone?

20:02.326 --> 20:03.441
How's Chris?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.400
I saw you guys talking.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.536
We were fishing.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.330
You don't talk
when you fish.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.928
One day Chris
will understand.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.223
What you did for his mother
was an act of mercy.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.137
What I would not give
to trade my failure

20:33.148 --> 20:34.263
What I would not give
to trade my failure

20:34.316 --> 20:36.102
for your mercy.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.373
- Hold-- hold on.
- Strand?

22:06.825 --> 22:08.690
Strand? Strand?

22:08.785 --> 22:11.037
That's still my name.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.622
Someone's playing music
out there on the water.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.201
That is unlikely.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.245
No, I heard it.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.459
Sound carries strange
on the water.

22:28.055 --> 22:30.967
Talking out loud to ghosts
up here, keep myself awake.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.594
Yeah, I heard that, too.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.800
It's a characteristic
of the gifted.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.970
And the crazy.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.857
You know,
you can sleep.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.234
We won't throw
you overboard.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.194
How deep is it here?

22:56.249 --> 22:57.705
44 meters.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.784
- Is that deep enough?
- Yes, more than.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.035
- Is that deep enough?
- Yes, more than.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.086
And we're all clear?

23:04.174 --> 23:06.165
Almost.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.215
We should
take care of her.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.803
Where you gonna go?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.881
I don 't know.
We thought maybe like Hawaii.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.886
That's far.
And it's Hawaii, right?

23:15.977 --> 23:17.888
It's like coconuts
in paradise.

23:17.979 --> 23:20.186
- Paradise?
-No one's gonna turn there.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.264
-ln paradise?

23:22.317 --> 23:24.308
But it's too far,
too far for this boat.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.434
But it's too far,
too far for this boat.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.603
Well, do you guys
have water?

23:27.656 --> 23:30.113
Yeah, we have some.
We 've got little pans out

23:30.200 --> 23:32.065
hoping it rains,
catch something.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.116
'Cause if not, we'll be
drinking our own pee soon.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.944
Mm, tasty.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.620
Yeah, how about you?
You have water?

23:37.707 --> 23:39.698
Uh, yeah, we have
a desalinization system.

23:39.709 --> 23:40.960
Uh, yeah, we have
a desalinization system.

23:41.044 --> 23:43.000
Now, that
is pretty swank, man.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.624
You must be rich.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.665
No, no, we--
we're just passengers.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.465
We don't have money.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.047
But you said you were
on a yacht, right?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.345
Yeah, it's a big boat.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.381
So do you think you guys
could make Hawaii?

23:55.392 --> 23:56.802
So do you think you guys
could make Hawaii?

23:58.603 --> 24:00.059
Pen‘ect day.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.179
l was thinking
the same thing.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.693
What comes next?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.486
What do you mean?

24:10.532 --> 24:12.648
You knew what was going
to happen in El Sereno.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.323
How that ended.
What now?

24:14.369 --> 24:16.360
How does this end?

24:16.413 --> 24:18.404
If this is the end of the world,
it's already over.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.996
If this is the end of the world,
it's already over.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.709
Have you seen Strand sleep
since we boarded?

24:28.800 --> 24:31.758
Ahab?

24:31.845 --> 24:34.678
He doesn't seem
to need any sleep.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.052
You don't trust him.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.850
He saved my son.
He saved us.

24:44.941 --> 24:47.353
His house was real.
This boat is real.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.188
He hasn't lied.

24:49.279 --> 24:52.021
He was packing his bags
before the bombs fell.

24:52.115 --> 24:54.197
He had no intention
of staying on land

24:54.284 --> 24:56.240
in his big house
with the tall gates.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.319
- Why?
- Thinks San Diego's safer.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.366
- Why?
- Thinks San Diego's safer.

25:00.415 --> 25:03.077
Maybe it is,
maybe it isn't.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.955
Maybe he has motives
he's not sharing with us.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.872
So we watch him.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.958
l have been.

25:15.263 --> 25:18.175
It's just my brother and me now and his wife.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.131
Just the three of us.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.888
Everyone's gone.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.970
Everyone else is dead,
turned, taken.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.437
Everyone else is dead,
turned, taken.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.147
/ even saw it happen
to my girlfriend.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.779
I'm sorry.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.796
Um...

25:59.891 --> 26:01.882
you all knew Liza long enough to see
what kind of person she was,

26:01.893 --> 26:04.430
you all knew Liza long enough to see
what kind of person she was,

26:04.479 --> 26:07.471
how devoted she was
to her family.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.435
She loved to help people.

26:09.484 --> 26:11.770
She would help anyone
and she did.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.436
She was selﬂess,
you know?

26:14.489 --> 26:16.400
She just would give
from her heart.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.032
And she could be ﬁerce.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.988
Oh, my God.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.119
She was so strong and...

26:29.045 --> 26:31.627
it was painful sometimes.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.715
And the best thing
that we ever did together

26:42.726 --> 26:44.842
And the best thing
that we ever did together

26:44.936 --> 26:46.847
was our SOD...

26:49.399 --> 26:51.390
who she loved more
than anything or anyone.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.357
who she loved more
than anything or anyone.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.408
Come on,
we've got to talk.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.583
No, she's gone.
She's buried now.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.244
No more strangers
staring at her.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.954
- They're not strangers any--
- Strangers to me.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.585
- Not to your mother.
- You don't get to say that.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.171
You don't get to say that
like you knew her.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.673
Get off me, Dad!
I could have said something different.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.178
- I could have fixed it.
- How?

28:04.265 --> 28:06.130
What are you gonna say?
What are you gonna do?

28:06.226 --> 28:08.433
- I could have fixed it.
- Chris, I'm sorry.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.511
I don't care.
You shot her!

28:10.522 --> 28:11.887
I don't care.
You shot her!

28:31.209 --> 28:32.995
Travis.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.838
It went
that well, huh?

28:39.884 --> 28:42.717
Oh, yeah, great.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.934
Jack?

28:53.982 --> 28:55.518
Jack?

28:55.608 --> 28:58.475
- Hold on. Shit.
- Jack, what's wrong?

28:58.570 --> 29:00.731
The hull got dinged up
when we were leaving the marina.

29:00.780 --> 29:02.862
We thought we patched it up,
but we 're taking on water.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.943
- Are you gonna sink?
-The bilge pump is working,

29:04.993 --> 29:06.233
which is a miracle itself

29:06.327 --> 29:08.158
We 're gonna try
and make land.

29:10.331 --> 29:12.538
You die on water,
you die on land.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.002
-Gotta happen somewhere.
-/t doesn't have to be now.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.078
We can come. We can come
and get you. Tell me where you are.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.164
/ can see the ﬁre
in the Santa Monica Mountains.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.381
/ can see the ﬁre
in the Santa Monica Mountains.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.459
That smoke plume, is that to
your north or your south?

29:23.470 --> 29:25.085
That smoke plume, is that to
your north or your south?

29:25.180 --> 29:27.171
- North.
-Okay, we 're just south of that.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.718
- North.
-Okay, we 're just south of that.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.803
Maybe two miles oﬁshore.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.434
How close are you
to Catalina?

29:36.524 --> 29:38.901
Travis.
Travis, someone needs help.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.229
- They're sinking.
- Who?

29:41.321 --> 29:43.812
Look, it'sjust him,
his brother, and his sister-in-law.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.026
Just three.
We can manage that.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.108
- What's this?
- Jack. His name's Jack.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.404
- What's this?
- Jack. His name's Jack.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.361
Who the hell is Jack?

29:55.710 --> 29:58.452
You gonna make me
ask twice?

29:58.546 --> 30:01.162
He's on a fishing boat
near here and he's sinking.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.713
You talked to him?

30:02.759 --> 30:04.670
Yes, I talked to him.

30:04.719 --> 30:06.505
Did you tell him
anything about us?

30:06.596 --> 30:08.587
|-- no, I didn't tell him
anything important.

30:08.598 --> 30:09.758
|-- no, I didn't tell him
anything important.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.265
What didn't you say, Alicia?
What didn't you tell him about us?

30:15.063 --> 30:17.224
It's mob rule on land.
You think it's any better out here?

30:17.315 --> 30:19.180
- Back off. - What are you gonna do, Travis?
You feel strong?

30:25.365 --> 30:27.356
Please, let me explain
the rules of the boat.

30:27.367 --> 30:30.074
Please, let me explain
the rules of the boat.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.698
Rule number one,
it's my boat.

30:32.747 --> 30:35.489
Rule number two,
it is my boat.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.541
And if there remains
any confusion about rules one and two,

30:38.628 --> 30:40.619
I offer rule number three,
it's my goddamn boat.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.837
I offer rule number three,
it's my goddamn boat.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.043
If it weren't for me,

30:45.134 --> 30:48.126
you would all be burned.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.927
You're welcome.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.981
I'm tired.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.644
Alicia's just trying
to help.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.071
She's trying to help those
who don't matter to us.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.153
She made a mistake
we can't afford.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.825
Everyone here
needs to contribute

31:12.871 --> 31:14.953
or at the very least
not compromise.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.205
And how do I contribute?
Why am I here?

31:19.085 --> 31:21.076
You mean on this boat
or here existentially?

31:21.087 --> 31:22.793
You mean on this boat
or here existentially?

31:22.839 --> 31:25.205
Either.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.177
How many times
should you have died?

31:36.144 --> 31:38.100
I don't know.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.104
Every time | used.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.567
Were you afraid?

31:46.029 --> 31:48.361
That's fearlessness.
That's focus.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.440
That's just being
an addict.

31:51.534 --> 31:54.321
It's not something
you put on your resume.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.403
But what does that fearlessness
look like in this world?

31:56.414 --> 31:57.654
But what does that fearlessness
look like in this world?

31:57.749 --> 31:59.990
That has value,
Nicholas.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.327
Don't call me that.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.828
Don't call me that.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.463
Your father
named you that.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.541
Yeah, that's what
he called me.

32:09.552 --> 32:10.667
Yeah, that's what
he called me.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.449
Hurt your hand?

32:38.206 --> 32:40.162
It's okay
to be angry.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.455
l was furious.

32:51.427 --> 32:53.588
lwas 13.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.265
It didn't end well.

32:59.352 --> 33:00.933
What do you want?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.391
I want you to come up.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.472
Chris, you need to eat.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.098
Chris, you need to eat.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.142
There's nothing I can say
that makes this better.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.734
There's nothing I can say
that makes this better.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.188
Hurts like hell,
I know that.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.489
And it doesn't go away.

33:15.576 --> 33:17.658
The hurt stays.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.488
But what happened
had to.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.864
But what happened
had to.

33:22.917 --> 33:25.624
And if your father
hadn't done it,

33:25.712 --> 33:27.077
I would have.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.582
I will never
let that happen to someone I love.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.676
- If not...
- Yeah, here.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.304
- ...they got fish.

35:09.524 --> 35:11.515
- What was that?
- There was a splash.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.396
Chris!

35:21.244 --> 35:23.326
Chris.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.492
Nick.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.251
What the hell, man?

35:36.300 --> 35:37.801
What the hell
are you doing?

35:37.885 --> 35:40.718
I wanted to swim.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.672
Oh, okay.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.506
Swim.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.137
- Is he okay?
- Chris.

35:49.063 --> 35:51.054
Hey, come on in.
Water's fine.

36:08.791 --> 36:11.248
- Alicia.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.660
-Are you there?
- Jack.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.791
We can't come get you.
I'm sorry.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.128
It's too dangerous.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.934
-Jack?
-lt's okay, Alicia.

36:32.356 --> 36:35.268
-/ got you.
- Jack?

36:35.318 --> 36:37.309
I'll see you soon.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.820
Mom!

38:04.907 --> 38:06.898
Travis.

38:20.923 --> 38:23.084
Oh, my God. Get out of the water!

38:23.175 --> 38:24.790
- Chris, get out of there!
- Get out!

38:33.686 --> 38:35.722
- Oh, my God.
- Where is he?

38:40.818 --> 38:42.809
- Nickl
- I hear someone.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.151
- Nickl
- I hear someone.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.821
Nick!

38:47.908 --> 38:49.318
-Where is he?

38:49.368 --> 38:50.403
- It's ﬂooded.
- Go!

38:56.709 --> 38:58.370
Chris!

39:14.935 --> 39:17.187
Nick!

39:27.406 --> 39:29.237
Nick!

39:29.283 --> 39:31.365
Nick, where are you?

39:44.131 --> 39:46.713
- Oh, my God.
- Where is he?

39:46.801 --> 39:48.962
- Nick!

39:49.053 --> 39:50.839
Oh, my God.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.759
Nick!

39:53.849 --> 39:55.305
Dad?

40:29.760 --> 40:32.046
Nick!

40:32.138 --> 40:33.503
Nick!

40:53.993 --> 40:55.949
He's right there.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.579
Holy shit.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.209
We should
be leaving now.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.840
Someone's joining us.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.921
- Travis!
- It could be no one.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.138
- Travis!
- It could be no one.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.719
It could be the ones
who did that.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.909
Travis has Nick.
They're coming back.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.533
Good, but this boat's
gonna be on us.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.914
They're doing a good 25 knots.
They're flying.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.743
- How fast can we go?
- Full out, 20.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.419
But that'll work the engines too hard.
We need a head start.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.706
You think that's the boat
that killed those people?

41:51.800 --> 41:52.880
You want to wait
and ask them?

41:56.805 --> 41:58.716
High.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.681
We have to go.
We have to go now.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.721
- What?
- Strand, we're clear.

42:06.732 --> 42:07.812
- What?
- Strand, we're clear.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.606
Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

42:09.652 --> 42:11.517
Whoever did that...

42:15.533 --> 42:17.273
they're coming back.
