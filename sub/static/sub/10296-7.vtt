NARRATOR: <i>Last week</i>
 <i>on</i> Married With Children...

01:18.934 --> 01:21.934
I saw one of those
in college once.

01:21.934 --> 01:24.467
I used to jog
behind her for hours.

01:24.467 --> 01:27.467
I ran a marathon once
and didn't even know it.

01:27.467 --> 01:30.200
 <i>The girls</i>
 <i>caught the guys ogling,</i>

01:30.200 --> 01:33.200

 <i>what's good for the gander</i>

 <i>is good for the goose.</i>

01:35.634 --> 01:38.067
Peggy! This is
a strip joint!

01:38.067 --> 01:39.067
Oh, really?

01:39.067 --> 01:40.567
Gee, I didn't know.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.067
You know, I've passed
by dozens of times,

01:43.067 --> 01:45.901
but I've never
actually been in.

01:45.901 --> 01:49.634
Oh, hi, Mrs. Bundy.

01:49.634 --> 01:53.834
 <i>At first, Marcie didn't</i>
 <i>think she'd like it, but...</i>

01:53.834 --> 01:55.601
It's always
the quiet ones.

01:59.601 --> 02:01.467
Peggy, I've lost
my wedding ring

02:01.467 --> 02:03.100
down Zorro's pants!

02:03.100 --> 02:06.634
 <i>And now</i>
Married With Children
 <i>continues...</i>

02:06.634 --> 02:08.701
All right, ladies,
let's hear it!

02:08.701 --> 02:10.434
That was Zorro!

02:10.434 --> 02:13.601
He's got my ring.
What are going to do?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.400
Uh... treasure hunt!

02:18.601 --> 02:20.400
Hold it right there, ladies.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.367
Listen, we've got
to get backstage.

02:22.367 --> 02:26.901
We've got to get something
out of Zorro's pants.

02:26.901 --> 02:29.167
That old story again,
Mrs. Bundy.

02:29.167 --> 02:30.601
But this is
an emergency.

02:30.601 --> 02:31.801
Yeah, right.

02:31.801 --> 02:33.801
Look, lady,
we used to let women backstage

02:33.801 --> 02:35.133
until the big riot.

02:35.133 --> 02:37.133
Now nobody's
allowed back there.

02:37.133 --> 02:41.534
We call it
"The Bundy rule."

02:41.534 --> 02:43.033
It's my wedding ring.

02:43.033 --> 02:45.267
I want it back,
or I'll see you in court.

02:45.267 --> 02:46.767
I don't think so.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.567
You see,
"Troy's is not responsible

02:48.567 --> 02:52.067

in any part of a dancer."

02:52.067 --> 02:55.334
Once again,
"The Bundy rule."

02:55.334 --> 02:58.067
What are we
going to do?

02:58.067 --> 03:01.167
I know! I'll write
Zorro a note.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.167
That's it!
He'll read it,

03:03.167 --> 03:06.200
He'll find my ring,
bring it over tomorrow,

03:06.200 --> 03:09.300
Steve will answer
the door, kill me...

03:09.300 --> 03:10.801
No, that won't work.

03:10.801 --> 03:12.801
I'll write a note,
but I'll give him

03:12.801 --> 03:15.801
your phone number
and address--

03:15.801 --> 03:17.601
that is,
if you don't mind.

03:17.601 --> 03:18.601
Sure, I don't mind,

03:18.601 --> 03:20.100
as long as he comes over

03:20.100 --> 03:23.567

gets home from work.

earthquake here last night?

05:09.400 --> 05:13.767
because the walls were shaking
and I heard Dad screaming.

05:13.767 --> 05:16.667
Well, he scares easily.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.200
I slept through it.

a short one.

No, but I think I slept with
Speedy Gonzalez last night.

things like that.

06:22.968 --> 06:24.501
Not Steven.

He notices everything.

Do you know what we do
in bed sometimes?

06:29.200 --> 06:31.267

09:08.467 --> 09:09.968
Yeah. She was tipping me.

Could you see to it
that she gets this ring?

you're too good-looking

believe she'll get it.

she was still tense.

something about women.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.133
Uh-oh.

See, women love us

10:19.434 --> 10:21.801
to look at them
like slabs of beef.

10:21.801 --> 10:24.734
You think they wear
those tight-fitting clothes

look succulent"?

10:31.601 --> 10:32.601
but they become
gym teachers,

10:32.601 --> 10:35.300

about women.

10:38.067 --> 10:39.767
I mean, let's
face it, Steve,

10:39.767 --> 10:41.934
until they get married,
they care how they look.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.200

to be looking,

and God bless them,

they're carrying
the rest of their sex.

I know all that?

I feel so guilty.

at Marcie's face,

all I can see
is that girl's hiney.

It's wrong, Al.

11:09.601 --> 11:12.067

of someone like Marcie.

Yeah. She is
a special person.

her wedding ring?

11:35.801 --> 11:37.300
Oh, yeah, yeah, here.

from the guy

they were wedged in,

11:44.534 --> 11:46.534

about it, Steve.

He's just some stripper
named Zorro,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.501

it was nothing--

11:49.501 --> 11:50.901
you know, no affair
that was important

11:50.901 --> 11:52.133
or anything like that.

11:52.133 --> 11:53.534
In fact,
knowing Marcie as I do,

11:53.534 --> 11:56.033
she probably lost it
with dignity

11:56.033 --> 11:58.801
because as we all know,

11:58.801 --> 12:05.834
we're dirt
and she's evolved.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.634
I can't believe it.
My wife's wedding ring.

12:07.634 --> 12:09.801
Steve, if I thought
you were going to be upset,

12:09.801 --> 12:12.767
I never would've told you.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.300
What I'm giving you
there is a present.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.801
See, that's more
than a wedding ring.

12:22.801 --> 12:24.968
What you have there
is what I like to call

12:24.968 --> 12:26.300
a get-out-of-jail
free card.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.801
See, you can hold it,

12:27.801 --> 12:30.901
save it,
use it for anything.

12:30.901 --> 12:32.434
She's got all this,

12:32.434 --> 12:37.767
and she goes
to a strip joint?

12:37.767 --> 12:40.767
Hey, you could've knocked me
over with a feather.

12:40.767 --> 12:42.767
But getting back
to something more important--

12:42.767 --> 12:45.267
how do we make her pay?

12:45.267 --> 12:46.767
I got it.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.534
The next time she holds
one of those

12:48.534 --> 12:50.267
women's group meetings
over at her house,

12:50.267 --> 12:51.501
you stroll in, you say,

12:51.501 --> 12:54.267
"Hey, eight women in the house
and I got dirty dishes?"

12:54.267 --> 12:57.767
Let them get mad,
pat the ring in your pocket,

12:57.767 --> 13:02.767
make the mark
of the "Z."

13:02.767 --> 13:06.467
Al, I am going
to have a Stepford wife.

13:06.467 --> 13:07.968
Attaboy!

13:07.968 --> 13:10.634
Do me one favor.

13:10.634 --> 13:13.634
When you strip away
every ounce of humanity,

13:13.634 --> 13:16.133
every shred of pride
she has,

13:16.133 --> 13:19.634
just when she's bending down
to kiss your feet,

13:19.634 --> 13:22.133
tell her
you got the ring...

13:22.133 --> 13:23.667
from Al Bundy.

13:32.734 --> 13:37.234
Hey, I've done a good thing.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.434
I deserve a reward.

15:02.934 --> 15:06.434
Hi, honey.
I was just going to tuck you in.

15:06.434 --> 15:08.868
Well, go ahead.

15:08.868 --> 15:11.400
I don't feel
like it anymore.

15:11.400 --> 15:17.400
Sit down,
sweetie puss.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.434
Honey...

15:19.434 --> 15:22.934
What's Troy's?

15:22.934 --> 15:24.434
Uh, well, uh...

15:24.434 --> 15:27.934
You know, it's this place
where I go with the girls,

15:27.934 --> 15:31.868
and we sit and swap recipes
and talk about the kids.

15:31.868 --> 15:34.734
And put dollar bills
down guys' underpants.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.234
Well, that too.
I'm going to turn in.

15:37.234 --> 15:39.334
It's a funny thing, Peg,
but the other day,

15:39.334 --> 15:41.200
I went to pay
the repairman,

15:41.200 --> 15:42.801
and when I looked
for my money--

15:42.801 --> 15:44.801
darned if every cent
wasn't gone.

15:44.801 --> 15:48.868
Oh, those kids!

15:48.868 --> 15:51.100
All right, Peg.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.634
Just how much of my money
has found its way

15:54.634 --> 15:57.501
into the crotches
of dancing, oily men?

15:57.501 --> 15:59.501
How would I know, Al?

15:59.501 --> 16:02.133
I don't count it,
I just shove it in.

16:04.901 --> 16:06.400
Well, that's that, then.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.901
Oh, uh, Big Red...

16:08.901 --> 16:12.400
you know,
I've been thinking.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.400
Remember
about a month ago,

16:14.400 --> 16:20.400
one night you came back
from swapping recipes...

16:20.400 --> 16:22.400
strangely,
how could I say,

16:22.400 --> 16:28.434
horny as a toad.

16:28.434 --> 16:31.434
That day I gave you
some money

16:31.434 --> 16:34.434
to have the brakes
on my car fixed.

16:34.434 --> 16:40.434
Do I have any brakes
on my car, Peg?

16:40.434 --> 16:41.834
No, Al.

16:43.934 --> 16:45.434
And remember you told me

16:45.434 --> 16:48.434
that the kids needed money
for a school project?

16:48.434 --> 16:51.167
We don't really sponsor
a Korean family, do we, Peg?

16:54.434 --> 16:56.334
No, Al.

Um...

17:10.467 --> 17:12.968
Well, how about
the kids, Peg?

17:12.968 --> 17:15.968
Did they really go
to your mother's house,

17:15.968 --> 17:18.733
or do they belong
to Arabs now?

17:20.467 --> 17:21.968
That really hurts, Al.

17:21.968 --> 17:24.467
I can't believe
you don't trust me.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.968
Okay, Peg.

17:25.968 --> 17:29.467
From now on, I want your
shopping receipts notarized.

17:29.467 --> 17:33.501
From now on, I check eyes,
teeth, vet bills, school books.

17:33.501 --> 17:35.634
Oh, and you know
our joint checking account?

17:35.634 --> 17:37.834
I want to know
what bank it's in.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.400
Well, in my defense, Al,

17:44.400 --> 17:47.334
these are superb men.

Don't push it, Peg.

their form.

who should
apologize to you.
