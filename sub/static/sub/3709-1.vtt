02:07.750 --> 02:10.042
Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

03:38.166 --> 03:42.125
You shouldn't have brought them.
- But dad is out there.

04:04.417 --> 04:11.167
Take cover. Port, get ready to fire.
- Get ready to fire.

04:11.291 --> 04:14.501
Hard to starboard.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.125
Admiral Tromp is trapped.

04:35.959 --> 04:38.083
Square away the yards.

04:38.209 --> 04:41.459
Michiel, this is madness.
- Luff up to port.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.833
Luff up to port.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.626
We can't leave Tromp to die.

05:01.750 --> 05:05.542
Chop it.
Chuck that mast overboard. Chop.

05:23.375 --> 05:26.916
We'll push those idiot English
back to their island.

05:27.042 --> 05:29.667
Until death, admiral.
- Go straight.

05:29.791 --> 05:32.125
Mainsail halyard.

05:36.958 --> 05:40.583
To port.
- Get ready to tack.

05:44.626 --> 05:46.834
Get ready to fire.

06:37.166 --> 06:38.500
Michiel.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.750
Good work.

06:53.916 --> 06:55.833
The admiral...

07:02.832 --> 07:06.333
He's calling all captains.
Get a sloop ready.

07:06.457 --> 07:10.748
You want to row there?
- You, you and you jump in, come on.

07:37.208 --> 07:40.458
Michiel? You're just in time.

07:40.583 --> 07:44.290
You'll be all right.
-It's nothing.

07:45.791 --> 07:47.624
We'll get you to port.

07:47.748 --> 07:50.123
The wind is blowing the wrong way.

07:51.583 --> 07:56.332
Like politicians, very unpredictable.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.708
Don't talk.

07:57.833 --> 08:01.790
My men need someone like you.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.665
Someone who keeps his course.

08:06.707 --> 08:10.207
You can do it.

08:10.332 --> 08:11.832
Michiel.

08:30.999 --> 08:32.707
Go and help people.

08:43.539 --> 08:45.208
Are you all right?
- Yes.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.790
This morning you also...
- I'm fine.

09:23.416 --> 09:28.958
The new prime minister
of Holland and West Friesland.

09:30.166 --> 09:35.666
The right honourable lord Johan de Witt.

09:37.666 --> 09:39.708
Thank you.

09:39.832 --> 09:42.166
As regent of the Prince of Orange...

09:42.291 --> 09:45.166
I think I speak on behalf
of all members...

09:45.290 --> 09:49.666
when I say we're glad with
our new chairman from mighty Holland.

09:52.873 --> 09:55.333
Some would say relieved.

09:56.373 --> 10:00.332
I, for one, will sleep better
now we have a man at the helm...

10:00.458 --> 10:03.832
who'll serve the interests
of all the provinces.

10:03.957 --> 10:07.082
And not just those
of his republican friends.

10:08.040 --> 10:13.623
I presume lord Kievit
can rise above the parties.

10:14.708 --> 10:17.333
I was thinking
of the Prince of Orange.

10:18.708 --> 10:23.082
How can the Prince
rise above the parties...

10:23.208 --> 10:25.748
when he doesn't even reach my belt?

10:29.458 --> 10:32.416
Order.

10:33.207 --> 10:36.583
We will hear the honourable De Witt.

10:38.665 --> 10:43.332
First, I'm very happy that lord Kievit
is sleeping well.

10:44.498 --> 10:50.916
To answer your question:
I understand your concerns. I do.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.749
There is no one in this country who
understands you more than I do.

10:59.832 --> 11:04.291
My father was imprisoned
for disagreeing with the Orangists.

11:05.291 --> 11:08.499
I found out what it means
to live in a country...

11:08.623 --> 11:11.499
where you cannot say
what you are thinking.

11:11.623 --> 11:15.207
Do you want to live in such a country?
I don't.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.373
I don't think you do, either.

11:18.833 --> 11:23.582
Let me pose you a question.
We're a nation of merchants.

11:23.707 --> 11:28.708
We sail the seas of the world
with 20,000 ships.

11:28.832 --> 11:30.958
In trade, we all work together.

11:31.082 --> 11:34.291
To get better prices
and to help each other.

11:35.541 --> 11:39.124
And what do you think?
Does this work or not?

11:39.749 --> 11:44.165
It does. Some members became so
successful they hardly fit in the benches.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.248
When you do business
in the East or the West...

11:50.373 --> 11:54.582
do you do so
as Orangists or as republicans?

11:54.708 --> 11:58.666
And why are the English trying
to block our shipping routes?

11:58.832 --> 12:03.665
To disrupt trade. Is that because
you're an Orangist or a republican?

12:03.833 --> 12:08.498
No, the English want to wage war
against us, because we're Dutch.

12:08.666 --> 12:10.083
Free Dutchmen.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.373
Large monarchies consider
our small nation too rich.

12:18.499 --> 12:23.790
Too successful and too free.
On top of that, we're a republic.

12:24.416 --> 12:28.332
In which all men are free
to live their own lives.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.874
We decide how we worship God.

12:30.998 --> 12:33.665
No leader is more important
than the country itself.

12:34.124 --> 12:38.916
The English begrudge us our freedom.
Our freedom frightens them.

12:39.041 --> 12:44.332
Because we're prepared
to die for our freedom.

12:44.458 --> 12:49.083
Because we paid for our freedom
with our own blood.

12:49.207 --> 12:50.999
And I'm asking you:

12:51.123 --> 12:55.624
Haven't you all lost a relative
to the Spanish or the English?

12:55.790 --> 12:59.957
And was that republican blood
or Orangist blood?

13:00.083 --> 13:01.083
No.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.957
It was Dutch blood.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.457
It's our blood.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.833
This is our country.

13:14.290 --> 13:17.582
A country we conquered from the water.

13:17.708 --> 13:20.123
A country
where we earn our own happiness.

13:20.249 --> 13:23.707
By working hard,
in the villages and cities.

13:23.833 --> 13:25.874
In the ports and on the main land.

13:51.790 --> 13:56.749
Our freedom can only be protected if we are
willing to fight for freedom for others.

13:56.873 --> 14:03.249
That is why the Dutch lion
holds these seven arrows in his claw.

14:03.373 --> 14:04.999
That is what binds us.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.498
Your freedom is my freedom.

14:16.457 --> 14:19.790
I'll defend this freedom
until my last breath.

14:19.916 --> 14:23.040
Hear, hear.

14:54.374 --> 14:55.790
Gentlemen.

14:57.790 --> 15:00.208
Welcome home.
- Lord mayor.

15:21.957 --> 15:24.498
Leave it, Neeltje.
I can do it myself.

15:28.415 --> 15:30.082
I said...

15:42.998 --> 15:44.665
Sorry, I look awful.

15:52.790 --> 15:56.040
Why aren't you in bed?
- I'm feeling better.

16:23.165 --> 16:26.874
How long will you be staying?
- For as long as you like.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.999
Honestly?

16:33.333 --> 16:35.832
I've told them to find someone else.

16:36.790 --> 16:38.457
What about the English?

16:39.957 --> 16:41.582
They don't pay enough.

16:46.540 --> 16:49.249
The English will be quiet for a while.

16:54.249 --> 16:56.582
I want to get on with our lives.

17:01.248 --> 17:04.249
We can finally extend
the vegetable garden.

17:05.748 --> 17:07.833
Great... As much as you like.

17:10.124 --> 17:12.915
I'm glad I ordered
an extra cask of beer.

17:18.665 --> 17:21.040
All those lost years.

17:25.207 --> 17:28.248
You were on your own
because I was away.

17:31.958 --> 17:35.166
Was it a boy or a girl?
- A girl.

17:48.957 --> 17:51.248
I'm staying with you now.

17:52.582 --> 17:54.999
I won't abandon you anymore.

18:23.207 --> 18:26.333
Good morning.
- Slow down.

18:31.791 --> 18:34.749
Daddy.
- Sleepyhead.

18:39.207 --> 18:42.707
We're awake now.
- I couldn't stop them.

18:43.249 --> 18:46.040
You stink.
- Yes, of seaweed.

18:46.166 --> 18:49.708
Do I need a bath?
- There is a letter for you, daddy.

18:49.832 --> 18:52.540
What kind of letter?
- Come with us.

19:00.499 --> 19:01.915
Go ahead.

19:02.873 --> 19:04.290
Hello, son.

19:09.998 --> 19:12.166
There was a messenger.

19:12.290 --> 19:15.499
He had a fat horse.
- He came from The Hague.

19:15.623 --> 19:18.666
Open it.
- Michiel.

19:19.457 --> 19:21.999
We're not aboard a ship.

19:30.873 --> 19:32.873
Look, it has a little hole.

19:37.665 --> 19:39.833
10 copies from this one.

19:52.249 --> 19:53.665
Tromp?

20:12.374 --> 20:15.873
Mr De Ruyter?
This way, please.

20:32.415 --> 20:36.290
Mr De Ruyter, I've heard
so many good things about you.

20:36.416 --> 20:39.582
Really?
- You're the man to lead our fleet.

20:39.749 --> 20:42.708
You mean with Cornelis Tromp?
- No, under me.

20:42.832 --> 20:47.123
And not under Tromp?
- No. I want you, only you.

20:47.249 --> 20:49.290
As admiral?

20:49.415 --> 20:53.248
We need to rebuild
and modernize our fleet.

20:53.374 --> 20:55.498
I haven't served long enough.

20:55.624 --> 20:58.624
You have more experience than any other.
- As a sailor.

20:58.748 --> 21:01.624
No one will listen to me.
- We'll make them listen.

21:01.748 --> 21:04.623
I'm not of noble birth.
- Even better.

21:04.749 --> 21:06.998
Sailors are conservative.

21:07.124 --> 21:10.666
You can't just make anyone
admiral of the fleet.

21:10.790 --> 21:13.457
That's not how it works.
- Yes, it does.

21:13.541 --> 21:16.311
It's the 17th century,
anything is possible.

21:16.372 --> 21:17.725
This is ridiculous.

21:20.374 --> 21:22.582
You were raised as an Orangist.

21:22.708 --> 21:26.291
Most men in Zeeland were.
- I'm not into politics.

21:26.457 --> 21:30.583
But that is an advantage,
sailors have to trust their admiral.

21:32.915 --> 21:36.582
De Ruyter, this is in our nations interest.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.333
I'm not setting sail again.

21:41.208 --> 21:44.707
In the last 15 years,
I've spent six months at home.

21:45.874 --> 21:47.833
You have to find someone else.

21:49.083 --> 21:52.123
Are you serious?
- Didn't I make myself clear?

21:52.374 --> 21:56.373
I won't find a better man than you.
- Of course you will.

21:56.499 --> 22:00.582
This is the 17th century,
anything is possible. Gentlemen.

22:04.790 --> 22:06.374
What a strange fellow.

22:08.498 --> 22:10.415
What a strange fellow.

22:12.166 --> 22:14.458
I guess we'll make Sir Obdam admiral.

22:18.832 --> 22:21.082
Damn it, admiral, what must we do?

22:22.666 --> 22:24.665
Retreat.

22:28.039 --> 22:30.539
We've lost 25 ships.

22:32.082 --> 22:36.414
3000 dead and 2000 men
taken prisoner by the English.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.540
Good men,
who fought for their country.

22:42.123 --> 22:43.748
Honest men.

22:44.748 --> 22:48.373
Who trusted the prime minister.
- Hear, hear.

22:48.497 --> 22:51.623
Who trusted him with their lives.

22:53.123 --> 22:57.165
Order.
- Do you think this will be the end of it?

22:59.082 --> 23:01.373
Is that honestly what you think?

23:07.331 --> 23:12.790
I'll tell you who is to blame.
That prime minister from Holland.

23:12.872 --> 23:15.290
And his republican friends.

23:16.040 --> 23:20.664
They should send him out to sea.
- This isn't your fault.

23:20.789 --> 23:24.748
The Spanish want our trade routes,
the Germans want to control our rivers.

23:24.914 --> 23:29.831
And the French can't wait to occupy
the Southern Netherlands.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.456
What are we going to do?

23:56.581 --> 23:57.872
Just go.

24:02.832 --> 24:05.247
I made you a promise.

24:05.372 --> 24:09.082
There is no use staying home
if there is no home left.

24:12.248 --> 24:14.290
Engel, come on.

24:17.289 --> 24:22.040
We need a strong leader
who is respected by other kingdoms.

24:22.289 --> 24:25.332
What do we do about it?
- The Prince of Orange...

24:25.456 --> 24:27.456
is nothing but a brat.

24:28.248 --> 24:32.873
A brat. Are we sure
that the Prince is a real man?

24:34.415 --> 24:38.789
I've been told he prefers ballet
over military strategy.

24:43.122 --> 24:47.372
Order, order.
- Gentlemen.

24:47.498 --> 24:54.040
Let's keep it somewhat civilised.
What do you propose, regent Kievit?

24:55.957 --> 25:01.331
I propose we appoint
the honourable lord Cornelis Tromp...

25:01.457 --> 25:07.373
son of our greatest naval hero ever,
as our new admiral.

25:26.248 --> 25:29.415
Mr de Witt?
- Mr Tromp.

25:29.539 --> 25:32.082
Do we have an appointment?
- No, we don't.

25:32.289 --> 25:34.789
I thought I'd speed things up.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.956
Since your father's funeral
I haven't had a chance...

25:45.082 --> 25:48.040
You're looking for someone
to replace my father.

25:48.248 --> 25:51.915
I'm looking into it.
- You probably don't realize...

25:52.039 --> 25:55.748
but the fleet will only accept
one man as their new admiral.

25:55.914 --> 25:57.457
And who is that?

25:58.998 --> 26:03.040
My blood is his blood.
The blood of Bestevaer.

26:03.789 --> 26:05.747
You might not understand.

26:05.832 --> 26:09.914
I understand the admiral
was a father figure to his men.

26:09.997 --> 26:13.497
But Bestevaer is a title of respect.

26:13.665 --> 26:16.623
You have to earn it,
it's not hereditary.

26:17.582 --> 26:19.747
I'm afraid it is, Mr de Witt.

26:19.915 --> 26:24.082
Heroes father heroes,
that's how sailors see it.

26:24.289 --> 26:27.748
And that, Mr de Witt,
will never change.

26:31.998 --> 26:34.873
You're still thinking about De Ruyter?

26:34.956 --> 26:37.706
Why not invite him to dinner?

26:37.790 --> 26:41.789
Johan, he's stubborn.
-Invite his wife too, this time.

27:02.622 --> 27:06.707
Mr. and Mrs. De Ruyter, welcome. Come in.

27:14.122 --> 27:16.956
Was it a long trip, De Ruyter?

27:18.581 --> 27:20.664
From Vlissingen to The Hague.

27:20.748 --> 27:24.914
Of course.
- Darling, don't just stand there.

27:24.998 --> 27:28.664
Won't you offer our guests a drink?
- Yes.

27:28.789 --> 27:32.457
You didn't tell me they have a baby.
- My wife, Wendela.

27:32.581 --> 27:34.748
What a cutie.

27:34.872 --> 27:37.206
Excuse me.
- What for?

27:37.373 --> 27:40.957
She is a cutie.
I'll show you round the house.

27:41.122 --> 27:44.706
Wine?
Or do sailors only drink beer?

27:44.747 --> 27:49.123
Girls.
Why don't you show us around?

27:56.372 --> 28:00.289
We need larger ships with more cannons.

28:00.372 --> 28:02.289
Larger ships, fine.

28:03.622 --> 28:06.122
They must be agile
and have a shallow draught.

28:06.290 --> 28:08.623
Merchant ships are of no use to me.

28:08.706 --> 28:13.248
I'll arrange it. What else?
- Better pay for the crew.

28:15.581 --> 28:17.082
Higher wages?

28:17.247 --> 28:20.332
If they die,
they leave a family behind.

28:21.998 --> 28:23.540
Consider it done.

28:23.665 --> 28:26.414
Doesn't the parliament
have to approve, first?

28:26.540 --> 28:28.415
Leave that to me.

28:29.748 --> 28:33.748
Each winter, the fleet lies at anchor.
It's a waste of time.

28:33.831 --> 28:34.872
I agree.

28:34.998 --> 28:38.789
If I were admiral,
I'd train the crew in winter.

28:38.873 --> 28:42.247
Exactly.
And that costs money, too.

28:42.372 --> 28:45.665
Carry on. What else?
- The sea-battles?

28:45.790 --> 28:50.081
In battle now, it's every ship for itself.
It's total chaos.

28:50.290 --> 28:55.748
Organisation is key.
- You mentioned sign flags in the past.

28:55.832 --> 28:58.331
The English have been using them
for years.

28:58.457 --> 29:01.456
But their system is too limited.

29:02.789 --> 29:05.957
The ladies are chatting.
Mr prime minister?

29:06.081 --> 29:09.082
Allow me to introduce my brother,
Cornelis.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.618
Tell us about the
system we developed.

29:11.679 --> 29:14.475
Our system?
 I happen to have it right here.

29:18.747 --> 29:21.123
We disagreed about the colours.

29:21.289 --> 29:24.748
Johan felt we were using too much orange.
- A bit too much.

29:25.748 --> 29:30.040
So, what do you say, De Ruyter?
Are you going to do this job?

29:30.248 --> 29:32.290
Or do you have more demands?

29:36.414 --> 29:40.914
I, Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter...

29:41.040 --> 29:44.164
The English have
a limited flag system.

29:44.332 --> 29:47.957
We're expanding our flag system
with all these codes.

29:48.081 --> 29:55.623
...swear allegiance to the Republic
of the United Netherlands.

29:55.748 --> 30:00.789
And then change the signal. Only
these 6 bow cannons are a problem.

30:00.873 --> 30:04.081
We tack as fast as we can
and then...

30:25.497 --> 30:30.915
We fire everything we have
on the port side on these ships here.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.331
Fire.

30:33.457 --> 30:38.040
Cool and reload. Come on. Faster.

30:42.122 --> 30:45.081
And?
- We're here.

30:46.498 --> 30:48.082
Wait.

30:49.831 --> 30:55.706
Do you really think I look all right?
- You're the Prince of Orange.

30:55.789 --> 30:58.123
All of the Netherlands loves you.

31:07.582 --> 31:10.957
Huzzah, huzzah, huzzah.

31:15.498 --> 31:18.789
Your Highness.
- Prime minister.

31:18.872 --> 31:22.747
May I introduce gentlemen De Witt,
Tromp and our new admiral?

31:22.873 --> 31:25.873
Admiral De Ruyter, our great sea hero.

31:25.997 --> 31:29.498
You can't imagine
how glad I am to meet you.

31:29.622 --> 31:33.872
I want to hear all about your travels
to Africa and your escape from France.

31:33.957 --> 31:36.915
This is my wife, Anna.
- Your Highness.

31:36.998 --> 31:38.498
Fascinating.

31:39.790 --> 31:41.581
Fascinating.

31:46.415 --> 31:53.039
I promise to do my utmost
to truly follow...

31:53.290 --> 31:56.039
the instructions and orders...

31:56.289 --> 32:02.872
in regards to my position as admiral
- the Supreme Commander of the Fleet.

32:33.456 --> 32:37.123
You're very brave to be here Your Highness,
surrounded by these republicans.

32:38.123 --> 32:41.581
The English fleet has set sail.
- Four squadrons.

32:41.665 --> 32:44.539
They're blocking our merchant ships.

32:44.665 --> 32:47.997
We have to take action
before our goods are lost.

33:09.373 --> 33:13.122
One, two, all together...

33:13.290 --> 33:15.832
One, two, all together...

33:22.998 --> 33:28.122
One, two, all together...

33:29.331 --> 33:31.498
Work those ropes.

33:31.582 --> 33:33.872
Get that wind in the sails.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.789
Render those ropes further.

33:44.540 --> 33:46.289
Come on.

33:49.956 --> 33:52.373
One, two, all together...

34:12.165 --> 34:16.040
If the wind turns, the rear squadron
sails around them.

34:16.165 --> 34:20.746
So I have to keep an eye on your flags
while I'm surrounded by flying canon balls?

34:20.831 --> 34:23.746
Just give me an extra 150 men.
- No, it'll be chaos.

34:23.831 --> 34:26.790
The English have more ships,
bigger guns.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.914
We stick to the plan. Or do we want
another defeat like Lowestoft?

34:32.706 --> 34:36.371
We must make sure
we're well-organised.

34:36.496 --> 34:40.746
Good, we'll do it your way.
You stubborn Zeelander.

34:41.831 --> 34:44.871
Are you prepared to die
for the fatherland?

34:50.789 --> 34:53.746
To the fatherland.

35:05.498 --> 35:07.414
Wonderful.

35:07.540 --> 35:11.289
God bless you.
- Half a turn to port.

35:11.415 --> 35:14.497
Half a turn to port.

35:21.540 --> 35:24.622
What's going on?
- Gout.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.581
Am I in the way?
- Not at all.

35:26.748 --> 35:28.665
A perfect target for the English.

35:34.540 --> 35:38.415
The Royal Charles.
Unsinkable, or so they say.

35:38.539 --> 35:40.707
All ships are unsinkable, Jan.

35:42.957 --> 35:44.707
Until they sink.

36:26.665 --> 36:29.873
Signal: In line.
- You mean this one, sir?

36:29.997 --> 36:31.498
Put it up.

36:55.831 --> 36:56.836
It's impressive.

36:56.897 --> 36:59.850
You'll see,
 it'll be every ship for itself.

37:12.622 --> 37:14.540
Captain.
- Yes, sir.

37:14.664 --> 37:20.040
Vanguard closer to the wind.
- Vanguard, luff up.

37:22.998 --> 37:24.789
Ready to go about, now.

37:25.915 --> 37:30.914
Pull up the mizzen sail.

37:31.040 --> 37:35.290
Come on, keep pulling those braces.

38:19.414 --> 38:23.873
Load starboard.
- Load starboard.

38:23.997 --> 38:26.914
Do you want me to call your mother?

38:27.040 --> 38:31.540
Get to work. Faster.
- Faster.

38:43.998 --> 38:46.290
Mainsail halyard.

38:55.748 --> 38:59.332
Come on, load. Faster.

39:10.914 --> 39:13.456
Faster.
- Keep it in the wind.

39:52.122 --> 39:53.915
Brace yourselves.

39:55.039 --> 39:57.290
Wait.
- Wait.

39:58.706 --> 40:00.331
Wait.

40:01.415 --> 40:05.040
Everybody wait.

40:05.332 --> 40:08.873
Jibs forward.
- Luff up.

40:12.664 --> 40:15.039
Wait.

40:29.457 --> 40:31.082
Attention.

40:57.956 --> 40:58.998
Admiral?

41:02.872 --> 41:07.498
Trim the lines.

41:11.415 --> 41:12.831
Fire.

41:47.165 --> 41:50.081
Let him be.
Get back. Keep firing.

42:02.081 --> 42:07.082
Pull up the mizzen sail. Luff up.

42:07.165 --> 42:11.582
Come on, get going.
- Come on.

42:11.707 --> 42:14.164
They need to reload faster. Come on.

42:44.081 --> 42:47.540
You're too slow.
- Why is it taking so long?

42:47.622 --> 42:50.748
Faster, or you're going overboard.

42:55.122 --> 42:57.414
Speed it up. Come on, boy.

42:57.582 --> 42:59.622
I need to shit.
- No shitting.

42:59.747 --> 43:03.998
Reload the cannon.
You can have that shit later.

43:05.539 --> 43:09.706
Come on. Reload the cannons.
Reload like lightning.

43:09.831 --> 43:12.498
Come on, reload.

43:14.289 --> 43:20.831
Get back to work. Get back to that
cannon. Are you sleeping or what?

43:22.623 --> 43:25.456
Captain, how is the rear?

43:25.582 --> 43:29.498
The English are on lee side.
- Middle squadron luff up.

43:29.622 --> 43:31.998
Gijs, middle squadron luff up.

43:44.331 --> 43:48.373
Hold the lines.
- Get that wind in the sails.

43:48.497 --> 43:51.789
Port. Keep going.

44:04.456 --> 44:09.207
Reload the cannons, starboard, port.

44:10.331 --> 44:12.956
Look, that Englishman is mine.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.373
Two points port.
- We need to stay in line.

44:16.497 --> 44:20.081
Two points port.
- But the signal from De Ruyter.

44:28.623 --> 44:30.582
All right, come about.

44:30.707 --> 44:36.165
Come about. Brace the sails.

44:46.747 --> 44:50.540
Load port cannons.

44:52.207 --> 44:53.790
Cover.

44:55.497 --> 44:57.539
Fire.

45:14.248 --> 45:16.122
Keep that head in the wind.

45:16.789 --> 45:19.996
De Ruyter's strategy is not going to work.

45:22.372 --> 45:24.788
And we're the ones under fire.

45:28.163 --> 45:30.996
Load port cannons.

45:34.122 --> 45:36.496
What are you doing? Get in position.

45:36.621 --> 45:38.455
Load port cannons.

45:58.038 --> 46:00.497
Grappling hooks.

46:00.621 --> 46:04.830
A portion of rum for the man who puts
the most English to the sword.

47:47.788 --> 47:50.455
Do you want a hug from De Witt?

48:26.039 --> 48:31.996
Victory is ours. A cheer for Tromp.

48:33.704 --> 48:37.622
A cheer for Piet's cannons.

48:37.705 --> 48:40.538
A cheer for our captain.

48:41.580 --> 48:46.704
And three cheers for our admiral.

49:30.913 --> 49:34.289
Can His Highness receive me?
- Certainly.

49:53.454 --> 49:56.080
Your Highness, lord Kievit.

49:57.954 --> 50:01.080
Our fleet has given
the English a beating.

50:01.246 --> 50:04.664
So De Ruyter is as good as they say.

50:04.746 --> 50:08.663
Quite a victory for Johan de Witt.
- For the Netherlands.

50:08.746 --> 50:10.747
Gentlemen?
- Of course.

50:11.871 --> 50:14.122
While I stand by doing nothing.

50:14.288 --> 50:18.163
All my relatives and friends
are kings or important people.

50:18.330 --> 50:23.579
Even those Habsburger simpletons,
with their in-bred minds.

50:24.747 --> 50:28.788
Why doesn't anyone take
the Prince of Orange seriously?

50:28.913 --> 50:32.704
You can play a decisive role.
If I may be so bold.

50:35.914 --> 50:39.372
You're the cousin of the English king.

51:32.789 --> 51:38.955
So, 7200, 8400, 10,800
amounts to a total of 5.14 percent.

51:39.080 --> 51:43.079
As I was saying, we can calculate
average life expectancy.

51:43.247 --> 51:45.704
And adapt the price of annuities.

51:45.789 --> 51:49.039
If my calculations are correct...
- They are.

51:50.122 --> 51:52.330
Indeed they are.

51:52.454 --> 51:57.121
The 7.14 percent the State
is paying out now, is far too high.

51:57.289 --> 51:59.704
So, we can save a lot of money.

51:59.789 --> 52:03.329
Money the State can use
to build more ships.

52:08.746 --> 52:14.414
But, must people die earlier or later
to make this work?

52:14.539 --> 52:16.954
Exactly, it's not clear.

52:18.372 --> 52:20.538
It's not clear.

52:20.664 --> 52:24.996
I'll explain one more time
what the percentages mean.

52:26.539 --> 52:30.122
Why earlier?
- Gentlemen, please excuse us.

52:32.705 --> 52:35.746
Didn't you say
you could explain it to a child?

52:39.121 --> 52:42.455
The English have sailed again, sir.

52:43.538 --> 52:47.705
De Ruyter will have to get ready.
- Sounds like a good idea.

53:09.414 --> 53:10.747
Thanks, guys.

53:28.039 --> 53:30.997
That goes in the kitchen,
and that one.

53:31.121 --> 53:33.454
And that one goes to the study.

53:33.580 --> 53:36.663
Are you sure?
- Yes.

53:36.746 --> 53:39.996
Need a hand?
- Michiel.

53:40.164 --> 53:43.538
Aren't you sailing tomorrow?
- Yes, with the first tide.

53:43.664 --> 53:46.955
I thought we'd have dinner together.
- Daddy.

53:49.704 --> 53:52.205
I have my own room.
- You live here too?

53:52.329 --> 53:55.954
We have our own box bed.
- Go ahead, I'll be right in.

53:56.122 --> 54:00.289
The admiralty suggested a larger house,
but this is near the harbour.

54:00.413 --> 54:02.704
As long as you live here.

54:04.913 --> 54:06.705
Dad, are you coming?

54:17.371 --> 54:21.246
Dad, this is our bed.
- Look at that.

54:22.288 --> 54:25.039
No boots in bed.

54:26.121 --> 54:28.413
You sound just like your mother.

54:30.121 --> 54:32.579
What are you doing?

54:42.496 --> 54:46.371
VOC? Can I have a look?
- Go ahead.

54:54.079 --> 54:59.539
Flooded cellar?
- I'll take the supplier off my list.

54:59.663 --> 55:02.455
Don't bother.
- What?

55:03.747 --> 55:07.705
You can't do this.
I've supplied the fleet for years.

55:07.788 --> 55:10.330
Why do we get the worst grain?

55:11.413 --> 55:14.122
Or do you supply this muck
to the VOC too?

55:17.164 --> 55:18.705
Is there a problem?

55:21.580 --> 55:25.371
You don't get better grain
for your republican pals.

55:28.288 --> 55:31.829
Who does he think he is?
We'll find someone else.

55:33.955 --> 55:36.372
What?
- That was the third one.

55:38.371 --> 55:40.079
Why didn't you tell me?

55:40.288 --> 55:43.329
Because you're busy
saving the country.

57:50.455 --> 57:52.538
Come and join me.

59:41.621 --> 59:42.997
Are you all right?

59:43.997 --> 59:45.496
Leave me, I want to be alone.

59:53.122 --> 59:56.788
Faster, guys.
- Come about.

59:57.788 --> 01:00:01.580
Keep it tight.

01:00:06.455 --> 01:00:08.455
What are they doing?
- Gijs.

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:13.413
They try to cut us off.
Take the signals to the front now.

01:00:13.538 --> 01:00:17.455
Tack over port.
- Ready to come about.

01:00:17.539 --> 01:00:19.704
Full about now.

01:00:47.704 --> 01:00:50.330
Get to work on the lower decks.

01:00:51.705 --> 01:00:54.289
Keep it UP-

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.871
Follow those two ships there.
- We'll break the line, Tromp.

01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:06.705
Sod off with your line,
those ships are mine.

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:10.496
Four points to starboard.
- Michiel ordered it.

01:01:11.454 --> 01:01:14.747
Who is the highest ranking officer?
Come about.

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:19.747
Four points to starboard.
Come about.

01:01:56.579 --> 01:02:00.330
Where is Tromp?
- He has broken line.

01:02:03.121 --> 01:02:05.371
Cannons ready?

01:02:20.038 --> 01:02:21.289
Fire.

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.538
Damn it.

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:43.039
God damn it.

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:40.162
Michiel, they're surrounding us.
- Where is Tromp?

01:03:49.912 --> 01:03:51.537
Keep pulling.

01:04:23.704 --> 01:04:27.246
I'm sorry, admiral.
- Lie still, don't move.

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:29.912
Admiral?

01:04:32.121 --> 01:04:33.955
It doesn't hurt at all.

01:05:07.954 --> 01:05:13.121
You're the rock on which I build, the
future awaiting me, my highest good.

01:05:13.245 --> 01:05:17.537
Seventeen killed on the gunners' deck.
All of them brought up.

01:05:18.787 --> 01:05:23.830
You're the rock on which I build, the
future awaiting me, my highest good.

01:05:23.912 --> 01:05:24.995
Hang in there.

01:05:52.995 --> 01:05:54.996
I've lost twenty ships.

01:05:55.079 --> 01:05:58.411
Who was in command?
- I gave you an order.

01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:02.287
So court-martial me.
- Get back into that longboat.

01:06:02.411 --> 01:06:07.704
Don't set foot on my ship or on any
other ship in this fleet, ever again.

01:06:07.787 --> 01:06:11.412
You are relieved of your duties
as of now, so piss off.

01:06:11.578 --> 01:06:15.954
Leave it to the court-martial.
- You disgrace the name of Tromp.

01:06:18.787 --> 01:06:21.079
Leave my father out of this.

01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:25.996
He'd be ashamed of you.

01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:37.079
Michiel, you can't do this.

01:06:37.203 --> 01:06:40.662
You want to be dishonourably
discharged as well?

01:06:43.954 --> 01:06:45.620
Come on, back to work.

01:06:45.787 --> 01:06:49.162
Get down there
and pick up those cannons.

01:07:28.496 --> 01:07:34.828
Master Buat is a loyal rittmeister.
You're executing such a loyal servant?

01:07:34.954 --> 01:07:39.328
Who is he serving? He went to
the king of England behind my back.

01:07:39.411 --> 01:07:42.703
In the national interest.
- Your interest.

01:07:45.996 --> 01:07:47.786
I've seen enough.

01:08:21.287 --> 01:08:25.746
I shouldn't have lost my temper
with Tromp.

01:08:27.328 --> 01:08:31.453
He is the vice-admiral, after all.
- He deserved it.

01:08:34.995 --> 01:08:37.787
Stay down or I'll put this
you know where.

01:08:40.162 --> 01:08:43.953
It's just a cold.
- Malaria.

01:08:48.953 --> 01:08:51.078
Where is the patient?
- Upstairs.

01:08:51.162 --> 01:08:53.661
De Ruyter?
- That's Johan.

01:08:56.078 --> 01:08:58.078
Do what you have to do.

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:04.871
We haven't heard anything from the English.
- They've run out of money.

01:09:06.412 --> 01:09:09.911
So why won't they negotiate peace?

01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:15.120
They hope we're afraid of the French.
We can't afford two wars.

01:09:15.203 --> 01:09:19.578
The French? Are they a real threat?
- No, but the Orangists are.

01:09:19.703 --> 01:09:22.703
They say I'm too weak
to force a peace treaty.

01:09:25.037 --> 01:09:28.036
You must force the English
to their knees.

01:09:30.871 --> 01:09:32.703
You have a plan.

01:09:35.162 --> 01:09:37.371
It's not without risk.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.662
You know the English fleet
is in Chatham.

01:09:40.828 --> 01:09:43.953
With the right wind
it's only a two day sail inland.

01:09:44.078 --> 01:09:47.787
You want to sail up the Medway?
- Yes. What?

01:09:47.911 --> 01:09:50.453
Is it crazy?
Would nobody do it?

01:09:50.662 --> 01:09:53.621
Sail through their chains?

01:09:53.745 --> 01:09:57.954
You must be desperate.
- I know it's a lot to ask for.

01:09:58.036 --> 01:10:02.036
Not now, get out of here.
- Sorry, dad.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:11.204
What about those sea soldiers
you're training?

01:10:11.328 --> 01:10:14.995
What do you call them?
- Marines.

01:10:15.871 --> 01:10:18.079
Is this a good time to test them?

01:10:19.621 --> 01:10:21.037
It's a bad time.

01:10:22.329 --> 01:10:25.036
Not even men like that
can be asked to...

01:10:34.245 --> 01:10:38.329
Forget about it, it's a silly plan.
Really silly.

01:11:02.203 --> 01:11:05.036
Which one do you want?
That one?

01:11:08.328 --> 01:11:10.245
Thank you.
- Bye.

01:11:13.953 --> 01:11:15.621
Hi, darling.
- Dad's up.

01:11:18.453 --> 01:11:19.996
What are you doing?

01:11:21.246 --> 01:11:23.162
Try to understand.

01:11:23.286 --> 01:11:26.162
If I don't go...
- Where are you going?

01:11:27.245 --> 01:11:29.079
Can't you tell me?

01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:32.745
That's a first.

01:11:52.911 --> 01:11:56.662
The Lord bless you and keep you.

01:11:56.786 --> 01:12:00.996
The Lord make his face shine on you
and be gracious to you.

01:12:01.078 --> 01:12:04.703
The Lord turn his face toward you...

01:12:04.829 --> 01:12:08.371
and give you peace.
- Amen.

01:12:14.786 --> 01:12:18.496
Thank you, my thoughts
are with admiral De Ruyter.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.036
Thank you.

01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:26.870
For my husband.

01:12:26.996 --> 01:12:31.078
I don't know...
- You know where they are.

01:12:31.204 --> 01:12:34.704
For my husband.
- For my son.

01:13:39.786 --> 01:13:41.912
Where is Michiel?

01:13:42.036 --> 01:13:45.454
These women have no idea
where their husbands are.

01:13:45.662 --> 01:13:47.746
Johan must know.

01:13:49.828 --> 01:13:53.036
Johan, I'm sorry to disturb you.

01:13:53.786 --> 01:13:57.286
Anna is here. Where is the fleet?
Where is Michiel?

01:13:57.953 --> 01:14:00.870
I don't know. I can't reach them.

01:14:01.996 --> 01:14:04.037
Tell her that yourself.

01:14:08.787 --> 01:14:10.370
Come on in.

01:14:24.204 --> 01:14:27.371
They're on the Medway.
- Heading for London?

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.704
It's time.

01:15:00.745 --> 01:15:04.912
Gentlemen, the people
are counting on you.

01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:08.787
Over to you.

01:15:10.786 --> 01:15:13.704
Men, into the longboats.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.411
Down.

01:15:45.703 --> 01:15:46.745
Up.

01:15:49.037 --> 01:15:50.620
Forward.

01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:38.786
Those brothers De Witt.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.079
Watch out.

01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:13.744
It's a shame to burn that one.

01:18:17.369 --> 01:18:20.162
Members of the State,
I present to you...

01:18:20.286 --> 01:18:23.120
the stern carving
of the Royal Charles.

01:18:34.787 --> 01:18:37.494
You didn't expect that one, eh?

01:18:57.369 --> 01:19:02.661
Charles ll has accepted our terms.
The peace treaty will be signed in Breda.

01:19:04.412 --> 01:19:07.078
Van Ginneken, let me embrace you.

01:19:57.327 --> 01:19:59.078
I can't do it.

01:19:59.662 --> 01:20:02.494
Delicious. It looks fantastic.

01:20:02.703 --> 01:20:04.119
Well.

01:20:05.119 --> 01:20:07.036
I propose a toast.
- Again?

01:20:07.119 --> 01:20:10.120
To peace.
- We've already toasted to that.

01:20:10.203 --> 01:20:14.037
To us.
- That's much better. To us.

01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:19.870
Can we go and play now?
- Yes, go and play. Quickly now.

01:20:19.995 --> 01:20:21.411
Be careful.

01:20:21.744 --> 01:20:23.369
Not too fast.

01:20:28.787 --> 01:20:32.161
What? Should I have proposed
a toast to the Prince?

01:20:32.287 --> 01:20:36.120
This peace won't last.
-It's politics. One day at a time.

01:20:36.245 --> 01:20:40.078
Michiel is worried about the French.
- You mean you are.

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:44.620
So, everything is fine?
The French are building up their troops.

01:20:44.744 --> 01:20:47.287
Rumours.
- Persistent rumours.

01:20:47.452 --> 01:20:51.077
So you want to expand the army?
- We should have done that already.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.952
The army is full of Orangists. How many
batallions will you give the Prince?

01:20:56.078 --> 01:20:59.411
You're asking for a civil war.
- Cornelis means...

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.702
I think I know what he means.
Damn it.

01:21:05.537 --> 01:21:07.078
Idiot.

01:21:09.536 --> 01:21:12.370
Can't we just enjoy ourselves
for once?

01:21:12.536 --> 01:21:17.495
We're at peace with the English. The
republicans hold a stable majority.

01:21:17.702 --> 01:21:21.202
In the meeting hall.
- Useless when the French invade.

01:21:21.286 --> 01:21:24.412
They never will.
- The people are scared.

01:21:24.494 --> 01:21:28.245
That's silly of them.
-It's all my men talk about, too.

01:21:28.369 --> 01:21:32.411
Diplomacy, Michiel,
diplomacy is the future of warfare.

01:21:32.537 --> 01:21:35.286
The people don't understand diplomacy.

01:21:38.745 --> 01:21:43.161
I can't adapt my policy to people
who understand less than we do.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:51.494
Come on, gentlemen,
we're having a party.

01:21:53.119 --> 01:21:56.077
I'm going to dance
with my fantastic wife.

01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:06.287
You heard the man,
we're having a party.

01:22:11.203 --> 01:22:13.203
Mr Chairman...

01:22:14.286 --> 01:22:18.412
they say that Louis
is gathering 100,000 troops.

01:22:18.536 --> 01:22:22.119
They say, they say...
Who says so? Who?

01:22:22.287 --> 01:22:27.537
Mr Van Ginneken has it easy with
his district behind the defence lines.

01:22:27.702 --> 01:22:29.661
Order.

01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:33.911
Mr Chairman...

01:22:34.037 --> 01:22:38.369
we've been paying huge taxes.

01:22:38.494 --> 01:22:41.369
And what are we getting in return?

01:22:41.495 --> 01:22:45.327
Give up the south and perhaps
Louis will levy less taxes.

01:22:45.453 --> 01:22:49.161
Would you say that to my face?
- I certainly would.

01:22:49.328 --> 01:22:52.702
I'll repeat it to your face:
Give up the south.

01:22:53.994 --> 01:22:56.702
Order, order.

01:22:57.412 --> 01:22:59.202
Gentlemen.

01:22:59.327 --> 01:23:03.620
Louis can mass all the troops
he wants, but he can't attack us.

01:23:04.411 --> 01:23:09.495
He'll face the Swedes and the English.
We have it in black and white.

01:23:09.912 --> 01:23:14.911
What if Charles breaks his word?
- We are on good terms with England.

01:23:17.536 --> 01:23:20.452
Right honourable member Kievit...

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:24.702
I hope you're not suffering
from sleepless nights?

01:23:26.911 --> 01:23:30.244
I'd sleep better
if the Prince were king.

01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:34.411
Only then we know for sure
that Charles won't betray us.

01:23:47.995 --> 01:23:53.203
You're responsible for the civil war
in this country. You, Mr De Witt.

01:23:53.327 --> 01:23:54.994
Damn you.

01:25:21.912 --> 01:25:25.578
The French are in Maastricht
with 100,000 soldiers.

01:25:25.702 --> 01:25:29.078
And Louis XIV is there himself.
- Not bad for us.

01:25:29.952 --> 01:25:33.911
Not bad for us?
What do you mean?

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:36.703
Do you realise
what is about to happen?

01:25:36.827 --> 01:25:40.077
Your Highness can save the country.

01:25:40.162 --> 01:25:43.911
And become supreme commander.
- And king.

01:25:44.036 --> 01:25:49.328
Charles has forged a deal with Louis.
- Charles has agreed not to interfere.

01:25:51.203 --> 01:25:52.953
Don't you get it?

01:25:54.203 --> 01:25:58.327
And you don't get it either?
You don't get it either.

01:25:59.536 --> 01:26:03.328
Do you think Charles
would give our country to Louis?

01:26:08.245 --> 01:26:10.495
The English will invade Holland.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.120
Go on, I'll finish this.

01:26:29.328 --> 01:26:31.161
Have you heard the news?

01:26:31.245 --> 01:26:35.162
The French are at the border.
- The English near the coast.

01:26:35.287 --> 01:26:36.537
And that's not all.

01:26:36.702 --> 01:26:40.453
The bishops of Cologne and Münster
are joining in.

01:26:40.577 --> 01:26:44.703
They've divided our country,
everyone gets a piece of the pie.

01:26:45.662 --> 01:26:47.578
It's not just about destroying our fleet.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:52.244
They want to land near The Hague
with a huge number of troops.

01:26:52.369 --> 01:26:56.328
You must stop them.
Our land army won't survive it.

01:26:56.453 --> 01:26:58.786
You're our only hope, Michiel.

01:26:58.953 --> 01:27:02.828
Don't let them turn us
into English and French provinces.

01:27:08.911 --> 01:27:12.912
Has it got worse again?
- I could do with some fresh air.

01:27:12.995 --> 01:27:15.953
It's better you stay with him.

01:27:17.787 --> 01:27:19.162
Thank you.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.744
I should never have weakened our army.

01:27:38.161 --> 01:27:40.452
If only I had fixed this earlier.

01:27:44.786 --> 01:27:47.911
This country has been blessed
to have you.

01:27:48.036 --> 01:27:50.412
No one could've predicted this.

01:27:54.161 --> 01:27:56.537
To the admiralty.

01:28:00.537 --> 01:28:03.202
Go on.
- Long live the prime minister.

01:28:03.327 --> 01:28:06.412
What was that?
You did not cheer for our Prince?

01:28:16.036 --> 01:28:20.161
Are you on Charles ll's pay roll?
Do you work for the English?

01:28:21.161 --> 01:28:25.828
I suggest you leave this sailor alone.
We'll be needing him.

01:28:25.953 --> 01:28:27.702
Get lost.

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:32.202
Aren't you brave?
Losers.

01:28:33.328 --> 01:28:37.077
You're going back to Vlissingen.
- No, I'm staying here.

01:28:37.161 --> 01:28:40.077
You're so stubborn.
- Look who's talking.

01:28:40.162 --> 01:28:42.036
Engel, get inside.

01:28:45.495 --> 01:28:46.911
I can do this myself.

01:28:49.119 --> 01:28:52.912
I'll take care of him,
you take the girls to Vlissingen.

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:54.994
Who says it's safer there?

01:28:55.077 --> 01:28:59.078
They think we're traitors
who work for the republicans.

01:30:11.244 --> 01:30:12.953
Eat your vegetables.

01:30:13.953 --> 01:30:18.162
I could hardly get through.
- Eat up before it gets cold.

01:30:19.162 --> 01:30:22.078
There are more and more of them.

01:30:22.162 --> 01:30:27.119
Why are those people so angry?
- Because they're afraid.

01:30:32.495 --> 01:30:34.495
First, they betrayed us...

01:30:35.787 --> 01:30:39.161
to the English and now to the French.

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.912
And De Ruyter is part of it, too.

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:45.411
If he wanted,
he could have chased them off.

01:30:47.495 --> 01:30:50.703
I've heard that he's keeping our ships
in the harbour.

01:30:50.827 --> 01:30:56.702
And that Louis wil make the admiral
the Duke of Brabant.

01:30:56.827 --> 01:30:59.994
The prime minister
has weakened the army...

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.828
so De Ruyter has all the power.

01:31:03.828 --> 01:31:06.120
Downstairs, now.

01:31:08.869 --> 01:31:10.537
Hide.

01:31:22.202 --> 01:31:27.245
Mummy, hurry up. Come on.

01:31:27.286 --> 01:31:28.952
Stay there.

01:31:37.119 --> 01:31:38.912
Let's burn his house down.

01:31:45.787 --> 01:31:48.536
Fire.

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:52.912
Go back. Go on. Just sit there.

01:31:59.162 --> 01:32:01.703
Here's a blanket, madam.

01:32:03.953 --> 01:32:07.245
Be careful.

01:32:24.244 --> 01:32:27.327
Don't you have anything better to do?

01:32:27.495 --> 01:32:32.077
Go back to your families.
- Your husband betrayed us.

01:32:32.202 --> 01:32:35.369
Betrayed you? Really?

01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:41.162
So what did my husband do when
the English attacked us at Plymouth?

01:32:42.202 --> 01:32:47.452
And Ter Heijde, and Bergen
and Chatham?

01:32:49.452 --> 01:32:52.078
Did he betray you then?

01:32:52.162 --> 01:32:56.037
Or did my husband save you
and your families?

01:32:57.703 --> 01:33:01.953
I understand that you're afraid.
I'm afraid, too.

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:09.827
So go home and let Michiel do
what he always does.

01:33:09.952 --> 01:33:15.995
Risking his life so that all of you
can sleep safely.

01:33:18.203 --> 01:33:21.911
He tried to murder the Prince,
together with De Witt.

01:33:47.286 --> 01:33:48.286
Don't leave, mommy.

01:33:48.412 --> 01:33:50.745
It'll be all right.
- I'm afraid.

01:34:10.452 --> 01:34:12.578
Long live France.

01:34:25.537 --> 01:34:30.036
You don't have a plan, admit it.
- Mr De Waerd.

01:34:30.162 --> 01:34:35.328
Cut it out. Stop delaying things.

01:34:35.452 --> 01:34:39.870
There is no time for political games.
- It isn't a political game.

01:34:39.994 --> 01:34:42.495
If the Prince gets in charge...

01:35:21.287 --> 01:35:24.661
Representative De Waerd has the floor.

01:35:27.787 --> 01:35:30.786
The situation is untenable.

01:35:30.869 --> 01:35:35.369
The only person who can save us,
is the Prince.

01:35:35.537 --> 01:35:41.662
The prime minister should
hand in his resignation. Immediately.

01:36:15.953 --> 01:36:19.120
They're waiting, Your Highness.

01:36:19.203 --> 01:36:22.911
It took them such a long time.
Let them wait.

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:30.036
I say we appoint Tromp as the new admiral.
- Someone we can trust.

01:36:30.162 --> 01:36:33.702
Since when can't I trust De Ruyter?

01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:36.619
But, Your Highness,
he's friends with De Witt.

01:36:36.745 --> 01:36:41.370
Please try to understand, Kievit,
we have to work together.

01:36:41.494 --> 01:36:43.953
I want to be the leader
for all Dutchmen.

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:02.453
Your Highness, it's an honour
and pleasure to ask you...

01:37:02.537 --> 01:37:07.911
on behalf of the Dutch Republic
to accept the title of king...

01:37:08.037 --> 01:37:11.452
like your ancestor,
William of Orange, once was.

01:37:12.495 --> 01:37:18.412
There is one thing
I'm really concerned about.

01:37:19.161 --> 01:37:24.287
Yes, we have received
some very worrying news.

01:37:25.411 --> 01:37:29.412
Concerning a secret plot
to assassinate the Prince.

01:37:29.537 --> 01:37:31.370
We also know who's behind it.

01:37:51.702 --> 01:37:55.203
Come on.

01:37:55.285 --> 01:37:57.411
Go on.

01:37:58.370 --> 01:38:03.411
I can make this a lot easier for you.
All you have to do, is tell the truth.

01:38:03.578 --> 01:38:08.952
You were part of a conspiracy
to assassinate the Prince of Orange.

01:38:09.077 --> 01:38:10.745
There are witnesses.

01:38:15.244 --> 01:38:21.161
I don't see how you want to deny...
- Yes, that's highly unfortunate.

01:38:43.785 --> 01:38:47.160
I can't turn this into more
than an exile.

01:38:47.286 --> 01:38:50.285
I assume you don't want
to end up here yourself.

01:39:20.411 --> 01:39:22.369
I think you should read this.

01:39:25.451 --> 01:39:29.785
Cornelis is accused of high treason
for plotting to kill the Prince.

01:39:29.911 --> 01:39:32.911
Johan asks me to testify.
- Don't be stupid.

01:39:33.035 --> 01:39:36.161
You heard me.
- The brothers De Witt are lost.

01:39:36.326 --> 01:39:39.118
Stay out of it.
- What kind of country would that be?

01:39:39.243 --> 01:39:42.201
I say whatever I want,
as long as I live.

01:39:42.286 --> 01:39:45.827
Back to shore, straight away.
Hoist the sails.

01:40:01.701 --> 01:40:04.285
We have to get his brother
here as well.

01:40:06.285 --> 01:40:10.286
Say that this comes from Cornelis.
- I don't know if I...

01:40:12.536 --> 01:40:15.576
We're going to be in power soon.

01:40:15.786 --> 01:40:19.201
We need to know who is with us
and who is not.

01:40:31.827 --> 01:40:35.744
There must be some kind of procedure.
- That depends on...

01:40:35.911 --> 01:40:37.286
A message for you.

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:48.493
Excuse me.
- Something must be done.

01:40:48.619 --> 01:40:49.911
Come on.

01:41:14.576 --> 01:41:18.911
Stand aside. Move. Open up.

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:35.368
It's okay. It's me.

01:41:35.494 --> 01:41:41.161
You shouldn't have come. It's a trap.

01:41:42.618 --> 01:41:45.535
Admit it. You can't do without me.

01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:59.911
We have to get out of here.
Can you walk? I've got you.

01:42:22.077 --> 01:42:26.619
And you don't know where he went?
- No, sir, I don't. Good evening.

01:43:52.451 --> 01:43:53.451
Traitor.

01:44:30.201 --> 01:44:31.702
I want to have his dick.

01:45:26.826 --> 01:45:27.952
Do it.

01:45:46.785 --> 01:45:51.368
There is De Ruyter. He's friends
with the De Witts. Get him.

01:45:52.284 --> 01:45:54.035
Get him.

01:46:19.993 --> 01:46:23.200
The heart of the prime minister.

01:47:01.159 --> 01:47:03.492
I thought you were at sea.
- Daddy.

01:47:05.243 --> 01:47:08.450
Where have you been?
- The Hague.

01:47:11.034 --> 01:47:14.035
Bring the children to bed.
- Come, children.

01:47:14.159 --> 01:47:15.785
Daddy's tired. Go on.

01:47:17.993 --> 01:47:19.492
Bye,daddy.

01:47:24.451 --> 01:47:28.410
What happened?
- I was too late. I...

01:47:30.909 --> 01:47:32.660
Johan“.

01:47:50.576 --> 01:47:54.076
Gentlemen, look.
Cornelis De Witt's penis. Five cents.

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.159
Piss off, man.

01:47:57.242 --> 01:47:58.993
Barbaric.

01:48:00.534 --> 01:48:03.034
It had to be done.

01:48:03.117 --> 01:48:06.410
They would've tried
to seize power again.

01:48:06.535 --> 01:48:08.992
We have to know who we can trust.

01:48:09.118 --> 01:48:14.285
We can't allow for Tromp
to serve under De Ruyter.

01:48:14.409 --> 01:48:17.075
I want to serve,
but not under De Ruyter.

01:48:17.243 --> 01:48:19.742
De Ruyter stays.

01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:23.993
I've appointed him for life,
and I'm a man of my word.

01:48:24.118 --> 01:48:25.825
Make it up with him.

01:48:30.450 --> 01:48:34.076
Old Tromp whispered something
to me before he died.

01:48:36.325 --> 01:48:41.409
About the way the wind blows, and that
an admiral has to keep his course.

01:48:43.326 --> 01:48:47.118
I thought he was talking nonsense,
but now I understand.

01:48:49.992 --> 01:48:51.200
Politics.

01:48:53.534 --> 01:48:56.409
Only one thing counts for an admiral.

01:48:58.409 --> 01:49:03.534
I've heard enough. You're going
to do what they ask of you.

01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:06.410
Go.

01:49:08.117 --> 01:49:11.450
Try to understand.
- They almost killed us too.

01:49:12.450 --> 01:49:13.826
I know.

01:49:18.785 --> 01:49:24.576
Promise me one thing. When all of this
is over, we go back to Vlissingen.

01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:26.450
You, me, the children.

01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:33.743
The army needs reinforcements here.

01:49:33.909 --> 01:49:38.618
The cities along the lJssel have
surrendered to the French.

01:49:38.742 --> 01:49:41.785
Let's turn the navy into land forces.

01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:44.034
Where can we cut the dikes?

01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:54.075
Your Highness, do you realize
what the consequences will be?

01:49:54.201 --> 01:49:57.700
Are you sure?
Thousands of people live there.

01:49:57.826 --> 01:50:01.701
All civilians, Your Highness.
- I want the exact locations.

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.825
Leave us.

01:50:08.493 --> 01:50:09.992
You stay here.

01:50:13.118 --> 01:50:14.410
Admiral.

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.075
Your Highness.

01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:23.284
I congratulate you
on your appointment.

01:50:25.992 --> 01:50:30.784
I know how you feel, De Ruyter.
- Do you?

01:50:32.326 --> 01:50:34.868
The French are nearing Amsterdam.

01:50:35.034 --> 01:50:39.034
The English will attack,
with the help of the French fleet.

01:50:43.534 --> 01:50:49.450
You have to make up with Tromp.
The country needs you. Both of you.

01:50:58.951 --> 01:51:00.784
I will follow your orders.

01:51:07.909 --> 01:51:09.575
I'm sure you will.

01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:12.450
You have my word.

01:51:12.575 --> 01:51:17.826
Well clone. Gentlemen, excuse me,
we're going to flood the country.

01:51:48.242 --> 01:51:50.659
Huzzah for De Ruyter and Tromp.

01:51:57.784 --> 01:51:59.493
Let's not overdo it.

01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:15.826
Let's get to work.

01:52:31.909 --> 01:52:35.784
Welcome, admiral.

01:52:46.743 --> 01:52:50.117
The English receive help
from the French fleet.

01:52:52.993 --> 01:52:55.617
You've already started.

01:52:55.742 --> 01:52:59.368
According to the latest updates
they're here and here.

01:52:59.493 --> 01:53:03.701
Not only do they want to destroy
our ships, but go ashore as well.

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:20.159
The English want an invasion.
That's to our advantage.

01:53:20.326 --> 01:53:25.410
They want to reach the coast, so
they'll try to go ashore here or here.

01:53:35.951 --> 01:53:41.325
The wind comes from the south, and
so we'll do what they expect us to do.

01:53:41.451 --> 01:53:44.035
We're going to sail in line here...

01:53:44.159 --> 01:53:49.535
and then Tromp is going to leave
a hole here. He's good at that.

01:53:53.118 --> 01:53:59.159
You want them to sail through.
- The tide could be in our advantage.

01:53:59.285 --> 01:54:00.701
It's our only chance.

01:54:02.576 --> 01:54:04.617
Brilliant.

01:54:04.742 --> 01:54:09.785
My head is like an old piss bucket.
Can someone tell me what the plan is?

01:54:34.451 --> 01:54:36.867
Girls, you're going with Klaartje.

01:54:36.992 --> 01:54:40.326
You can't go to the coast by yourself.
- Go on.

01:54:42.326 --> 01:54:46.617
Not through the front door.
Through the back.

01:55:09.409 --> 01:55:12.201
Hoist the sails. Pull the ropes.

01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:57.950
Keep going.

01:55:58.242 --> 01:56:00.076
They're taking the bait.

01:56:22.659 --> 01:56:24.868
Come on.

01:56:35.409 --> 01:56:37.409
Everyone, get off the ship.

01:57:02.951 --> 01:57:05.659
We're going through that hole there.

01:57:07.617 --> 01:57:09.993
It's our chance to reach the coast.

01:57:12.951 --> 01:57:15.326
Man the guns.

01:57:17.325 --> 01:57:20.493
Hurry up, prepare the cannons.

01:57:31.659 --> 01:57:35.743
For once I do what you say...
- Admiral. The French fleet arrived.

01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:38.242
Take the Vooruitgang.
You know the plan.

01:57:38.368 --> 01:57:40.410
Aye aye, admiral.

01:57:40.492 --> 01:57:43.576
Boatswains in front of the mast.

01:58:34.076 --> 01:58:36.450
Prepare to come about.

01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:45.035
Get ready.

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:48.534
De Ruyter is trying to defend
the coast. Let's go.

01:59:20.117 --> 01:59:23.118
Damn it.

01:59:23.243 --> 01:59:25.325
Abandon ship.

01:59:37.118 --> 01:59:40.076
Let us come about then.

01:59:40.201 --> 01:59:43.993
Load starboard.

01:59:44.117 --> 01:59:46.200
Prepare to come about.

01:59:49.285 --> 01:59:50.576
Come about.

01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:53.909
Prepare to come about.

02:00:11.618 --> 02:00:13.576
Every ship should pull back.

02:00:13.867 --> 02:00:17.450
Lift those cannons. Up.

02:00:17.535 --> 02:00:19.617
Carpenters, to the front.

02:00:27.951 --> 02:00:30.243
Fire.

02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:50.617
Pull back.

02:00:51.993 --> 02:00:55.701
Pull back.

02:01:23.285 --> 02:01:25.492
To victory.

02:01:27.409 --> 02:01:30.451
Huzzah for De Ruyter.

02:01:34.575 --> 02:01:37.660
Bestevaer.

02:01:42.785 --> 02:01:47.118
Bestevaer.

02:02:07.450 --> 02:02:11.992
You know what you promised.
- Just one more talk and it's over.

02:02:12.076 --> 02:02:14.160
People are being arrested everywhere.

02:02:14.284 --> 02:02:17.867
Don't say anything foolish
to the Prince.

02:02:18.035 --> 02:02:21.992
There are some people here
I want to introduce you to.

02:02:22.117 --> 02:02:26.535
These gentleman represent
about a quarter of our army.

02:02:26.659 --> 02:02:28.743
You want me to join a rebellion?

02:02:28.825 --> 02:02:34.243
You can be the symbol of our
resistance. The people look up to you.

02:02:34.367 --> 02:02:38.201
And I have the fleet behind me.
You're crazy, man.

02:02:38.325 --> 02:02:40.826
Plunge the country into a civil war?

02:02:41.617 --> 02:02:45.951
Anything is better
than a dictatorship.

02:02:49.243 --> 02:02:52.409
A disgrace.
This is a total disgrace.

02:02:52.868 --> 02:02:55.992
Be careful, Michiel.
Trust no one.

02:03:12.492 --> 02:03:13.910
Look around you.

02:03:14.035 --> 02:03:17.910
That just gives
them a reason to arrest you.

02:03:18.034 --> 02:03:21.743
We have to show
that we can work together.

02:03:22.785 --> 02:03:25.492
We must rebuild this country together.

02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:48.575
The republicans are reorganizing.
- They want De Ruyter as their leader.

02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:53.743
The people love him.
- That's the problem, Your Highness.

02:03:53.867 --> 02:03:56.243
We have a plan to solve that problem.

02:04:05.118 --> 02:04:07.326
The Prince of Orange.

02:04:25.576 --> 02:04:26.992
Thank you.

02:04:31.118 --> 02:04:33.867
I would like to thank one man...

02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:39.409
without whom this glorious victory
would never have occurred.

02:04:39.576 --> 02:04:43.034
The great hero
from the Battle of Texel:

02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:44.659
Cornelis Tromp.

02:04:49.076 --> 02:04:51.534
They don't know what they're doing.

02:05:08.910 --> 02:05:10.325
Bravo.

02:05:12.451 --> 02:05:13.785
Bravo.

02:05:40.034 --> 02:05:43.200
Do you have a moment?
I'll be right with you.

02:05:56.076 --> 02:05:59.660
Retirement?
Back to Zeeland?

02:05:59.784 --> 02:06:02.660
What will the Netherlands do
without you?

02:06:02.784 --> 02:06:05.826
This country has a great leader.

02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:08.242
The country has a great leader.

02:06:08.368 --> 02:06:11.451
How can I be a great leader
for all the Dutch...

02:06:11.575 --> 02:06:15.576
if they don't all love me?
I'm not like him.

02:06:16.576 --> 02:06:19.785
Your Highness
is underestimating himself.

02:06:21.034 --> 02:06:22.034
Are you serious?

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:27.492
The king can unite the country.
Rise above the parties.

02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:31.201
You want me to release the rebels.
- A nice gesture.

02:06:31.285 --> 02:06:33.910
Have you heard
what they say about me?

02:06:33.992 --> 02:06:38.660
That's how they thank me,
after everything I did for my people.

02:06:38.785 --> 02:06:41.035
Surely you can admit that.

02:06:41.784 --> 02:06:45.659
Should I just watch the republicans
ruin our country?

02:06:45.784 --> 02:06:47.659
I can't just stand idly by.

02:06:47.785 --> 02:06:50.617
Like with Johan and Cornelis de Witt?

02:06:50.785 --> 02:06:54.326
Was that massacre also
for the good of the country?

02:06:54.492 --> 02:06:58.034
I had nothing...
- Nothing to do with that?

02:07:00.617 --> 02:07:04.035
We couldn't control the mob.
No one had any idea.

02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:07.492
Your people incited the nation
against the De Witts for months.

02:07:08.492 --> 02:07:12.826
Pamphlets, agitators,
filthy back room politics.

02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:14.826
How dare you?

02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:18.368
You'll have to live
with your conscience.

02:07:18.534 --> 02:07:21.326
How dare you?

02:07:22.159 --> 02:07:24.576
Still De Witt's friend, eh?

02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:28.118
I'm starting to doubt
if you'll obey me when it's needed.

02:07:28.243 --> 02:07:30.785
I have always served my country.

02:07:30.909 --> 02:07:33.909
If only the country
was as stable as you.

02:07:34.909 --> 02:07:38.200
Your Highness can be assured
of my dedication.

02:07:43.743 --> 02:07:45.160
But am I?

02:08:07.034 --> 02:08:08.285
Admiral.

02:08:14.325 --> 02:08:18.409
I hoped this wouldn't be necessary,
but my advisers were right.

02:08:19.701 --> 02:08:22.784
I'll accept your retirement
on one condition.

02:08:23.826 --> 02:08:28.785
Your Highness?
- You carry out one last mission.

02:08:28.909 --> 02:08:34.285
You're going to the Mediterranean Sea.
- A secret mission against the French.

02:08:34.450 --> 02:08:36.117
Why should I?

02:08:36.201 --> 02:08:39.909
It's not wise to refuse a direct order
from your Prince.

02:08:41.659 --> 02:08:44.867
It's hard to protect
a traitor's family.

02:08:51.075 --> 02:08:52.367
De Ruyter.

02:09:14.951 --> 02:09:20.575
I might as well have condemned him to
death. That would've been more honest.

02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:23.451
Think of it as an act
of a true statesman.

02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:37.575
I've decided to form an alliance
with the English throne.

02:09:38.993 --> 02:09:42.534
I have to seize this opportunity.

02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:48.242
A marriage with Mary Stuart.

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:56.117
Think of it as an act
of a true statesman.

02:10:13.325 --> 02:10:15.075
I couldn't sleep either.

02:10:22.534 --> 02:10:24.326
Why, Michiel?

02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:30.367
Why did you accept that mission?

02:10:31.743 --> 02:10:34.118
You have nothing to prove.
They can't force us.

02:10:34.242 --> 02:10:36.117
That's not it.

02:10:36.368 --> 02:10:40.618
So you want a state funeral?
- I don't want to cause a civil war.

02:10:40.784 --> 02:10:45.034
And you won't. It's not your fault
those men are in prison.

02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:47.660
Someone has to obey the Prince.

02:10:47.785 --> 02:10:49.743
The Prince?

02:10:49.867 --> 02:10:54.285
He only wants to get rid of you.
They all want to get rid of you.

02:10:54.409 --> 02:10:58.575
Your success is too great.
Don't you see what they're doing?

02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:01.785
They want you dead,
just like with Johan.

02:11:01.909 --> 02:11:07.034
Someone needs to lead by example.
- A good example.

02:11:07.159 --> 02:11:10.700
Let someone else do it.
They always reconcile.

02:11:10.826 --> 02:11:14.493
Too much blood has been spilled.
The country is torn.

02:11:14.575 --> 02:11:17.618
I don't care if the country is torn.

02:11:17.701 --> 02:11:20.910
I just want us to enjoy
our retirement in peace.

02:11:22.868 --> 02:11:24.742
What do you mean?

02:11:33.742 --> 02:11:35.700
What did the Prince say?

02:11:36.742 --> 02:11:38.284
Did he threaten us?

02:11:40.575 --> 02:11:43.950
So he did.
- He wasn't even subtle about it.

02:11:44.035 --> 02:11:47.660
And you want to risk your life again
for a man like that?

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:52.034
A man who has never cared
about other people...

02:11:52.118 --> 02:11:54.867
or what it's like for us
and the children.

02:11:54.992 --> 02:11:58.159
I do this for you and the children.

02:11:59.993 --> 02:12:03.325
He guarantees your safety
while I'm gone.

02:12:06.743 --> 02:12:09.325
And if you survive and come back?

02:12:11.326 --> 02:12:12.867
Will it be over then?

02:12:13.742 --> 02:12:15.700
Will they leave us alone?

02:12:20.992 --> 02:12:22.992
You're not coming back.

02:12:25.825 --> 02:12:29.201
You're not leaving me alone,
do you hear me?

02:12:30.576 --> 02:12:32.950
You're not leaving me by myself.

02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:38.617
Of course, darling.
Of course I'm coming back.

02:12:45.450 --> 02:12:46.868
No, no, no, no.

02:12:57.326 --> 02:12:58.992
Be a good boy.

02:12:59.951 --> 02:13:07.035
Raise up. Smooth.

02:13:14.659 --> 02:13:16.785
Daddy loves you very much.

02:13:22.575 --> 02:13:24.117
Forgive me, my love.

02:14:02.326 --> 02:14:04.242
Come on, let's go home.

02:14:50.325 --> 02:14:53.868
I count no more than 12 ships.
Where is the Seven Provinces?

02:14:58.618 --> 02:15:01.910
Is that all they have?
What's the honour in that?

02:15:09.617 --> 02:15:12.993
Prepare for combat.
- Get ready.

02:15:51.242 --> 02:15:54.575
Load the cannons.

02:16:11.159 --> 02:16:13.325
Fire.

02:16:24.368 --> 02:16:26.326
Reload the cannons.

02:16:41.575 --> 02:16:43.535
Hurry up with those cannons.

02:16:53.367 --> 02:16:54.992
God damn it.

02:17:10.742 --> 02:17:12.950
Faster, faster.

02:18:33.075 --> 02:19:09.782
Fire.

02:19:09.782 --> 02:19:12.032
Surgeon to the top deck.

02:19:15.118 --> 02:19:16.950
Stay with us.

02:19:17.657 --> 02:19:20.575
Slightly more to port.

02:19:22.993 --> 02:19:24.368
Anna.

02:19:53.284 --> 02:19:55.618
Michiel de Ruyter is dead.

02:19:57.159 --> 02:20:01.908
Load the cannons with blank shells.
Let's honour our enemy.

02:20:02.034 --> 02:20:04.825
Get ready to pay tribute.

02:21:37.533 --> 02:21:40.117
Look at them.

02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:44.576
Orangists and republicans,
side by side for the first time.

02:21:49.575 --> 02:21:51.451
I never could have done that.

02:22:04.159 --> 02:22:05.908
I've seen enough.

02:22:10.659 --> 02:22:12.492
The end of an era.

02:22:13.826 --> 02:22:16.159
That is Anna De Ruyter,
let her through.

02:22:39.825 --> 02:22:44.451
Give him the most beautiful grave
possible.

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:48.034
All right.
