WEBVTT

00:29.229 --> 00:32.131
All right. What's happened?

00:33.233 --> 00:34.400
Everything?

01:43.837 --> 01:46.839
This will only
take a minute, Mr. Freeman.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.540
Uh, forget the mess.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.810
My secretary's taken
the day off again.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.313
Some hasidic holiday
or something.

01:54.315 --> 01:58.450
It's a rosha... krishna...
Shanana... who the hell knows.

01:58.452 --> 02:02.287
Anyhow, as you know,
your mother owed bad taxes,

02:02.289 --> 02:05.424
so there's really nothing
to turn over

02:05.426 --> 02:09.627
other than one ring,
emerald clad, platinum setting,

02:09.630 --> 02:12.197
one box, cardboard variety,

02:12.199 --> 02:18.770
containing her, mm...
"Most prized possessions."

02:18.772 --> 02:23.809
<i> Otherwise. The government's</i>
<i> got you by the flagpole,</i>
<i> Mr. Freeman,</i>

02:23.811 --> 02:26.311
<i> and they usually win</i>
<i> in that tug of war.</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:28.614
<i> Now, if you would press hard,</i>

02:28.616 --> 02:32.818
and bend it that way,
it's there, three copies,

02:32.820 --> 02:35.220
<i> right there, and right here,</i>

02:35.222 --> 02:37.523
<i> and one more time.</i>

02:38.726 --> 02:41.426
And that's it.
Thank you, sir.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.495
For your time,
for your business.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.864
And for not blubbering
on the mahogany.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.534
Oh, whoa!
Hold on a minute.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.503
Looks like we got a floater.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.573
It seems, Mr. Freeman,
that there is one bill

02:54.575 --> 02:58.610
your dear old mama
did manage to pay off.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.777
-hi, Rhonda.
-Hi, Lenny.

03:31.779 --> 03:32.911
Sorry about your loss.

03:32.913 --> 03:37.516
Um, before I leave, I just
wanted to say that it has been
so nice working with you

03:37.518 --> 03:40.552
and I'm so sorry we never
got a chance to go out
on a date or anything

03:40.554 --> 03:44.423
because you know, you always
were busy with relatives
in the town and stuff.

03:44.425 --> 03:48.327
And I wanna thank you for
being my best work pal, Allen.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.297
Look for me in television.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.864
<i> And now,</i>
<i> live from las Vegas,</i>

04:58.866 --> 05:00.699
<i> it's the</i> monte guy show.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.435
<i> Tonight's guests include</i>
<i> comedian Jimmy Shaw,</i>

05:03.437 --> 05:06.672
<i>and the winner of last year's</i>
stand-up stand-off Willy Vince.

05:06.674 --> 05:10.909
<i> Now, let's say hello</i>
<i> to monte guy.</i>

05:14.480 --> 05:16.448
-Hey, Shakespeare.
-Hmm?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.583
You in for oxygen or
just another refill?

05:18.585 --> 05:21.520
"No, thank you,
I've just about
milked the shit out of

05:21.522 --> 05:25.424
or, "no, thank you,
I'm about ready to
order something

05:25.426 --> 05:28.593
so I don't waste any more of
the lovely miss Evelyn's
valuable fucking time"?

05:28.595 --> 05:30.529
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes, um, how are your eggs?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.798
Just dandy.
How's your sperm?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.000
It's a joke.
What, you zombie people
got no sense of humor?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.703
I'm sorry. I just didn't
realize you were
trying to be funny.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.504
I wasn't trying to be funny.
I am funny.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.605
There's a difference.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.675
Why don't you save your
negative commentary for
the shit on the menu?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.111
Um, I will have three eggs.

05:46.113 --> 05:52.017
Oh, and a side of sausage,
a side of bacon, and a side
of biscuits and gravy, please.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.753
Would you like that for here
or to go?

05:55.588 --> 05:57.055
It's a joke!

05:57.057 --> 06:01.093
Hey, what are you
getting off for
my shit ain't funny?

06:01.095 --> 06:03.395
I'll have you know my shit
is very funny.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.731
Hey, Richie, tell the man
how funny my shit is.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.833
Your shit is very funny.

06:07.835 --> 06:11.436
What? You wanna be zombie
sides? Don't have pockets
or a sense of humor?

06:11.438 --> 06:13.739
No, actually, I am
a stand-up comedian.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.440
I mean, I will be soon.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.980
That is the funniest shit
i had heard in weeks.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.084
No, no, not yet, but I'm on
my way to las Vegas for
the monte guy audition.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.819
-The what?
-The <i> stand-up stand-off.</i>

06:27.821 --> 06:30.722
You know, monte guy.
- Huh.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.125
Well, I'm sure he'll just snap
your writer's ass right up,

06:33.127 --> 06:36.395
you being on the cutting cost
with contemporary comedy
and all.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.863
That wasn't very nice.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.564
Hey, you started it, pillsbury.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.133
You sit there,
all rude and shit,

06:41.135 --> 06:42.868
start pulling
an easter island on me.

06:42.870 --> 06:48.707
where they'll be
more fully appreciated.
You hear that Richie?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.609
-Okay, I said I was sorry.
-Too late.

06:50.611 --> 06:55.547
Hey, Louis, three eggs,
and fuck 'em up.
And heavy on the cholesterol.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.417
I got Bob hope out here
on the road to a coronary.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.431
- <i> George?</i>
<i>-  Yes?</i>

07:12.433 --> 07:14.466
<i> You're awfully funny</i>
<i> on the radio.</i>

07:14.468 --> 07:19.871
<i> You're the funniest</i> <i>comedian in the world, George.
</i> <i>May I have your autograph?</i>

07:19.873 --> 07:22.140
- <i> You wanted</i> <i> my autograph?
- </i> -<i> Yes.</i>

07:22.142 --> 07:24.609
<i>Right here on this dotted line.</i>

07:24.611 --> 07:26.878
<i> Oh, so that's</i>
<i> what you're up to,</i>

07:26.880 --> 07:29.614
<i> trying to get my signature</i>
<i> on that silly contract.</i>

07:29.616 --> 07:31.516
<i> Well, it didn't work.</i>
<i> Now get out of here.</i>

07:31.518 --> 07:32.884
<i> Yes, dear.</i>

07:58.711 --> 08:01.146
-Costume party?
-Oh, no, thank you.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.681
I'm on my way to las Vegas.

08:02.683 --> 08:09.254
Either way, once you hit
lamb bone, just keep an eye
out for that heavenly glow.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.890
-Can't miss it.
-Uh, thank you.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.658
Is the bathroom clean?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.627
Just ate dinner off the floor.

09:09.682 --> 09:10.916
Hello?

09:11.884 --> 09:13.552
Dirty guy?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.771
Sorry, chief,
didn't mean to startle you.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.273
Was wondering if you could
spare me a lift.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.876
I'm sorry.
I'm not going that way.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.580
How do you know?

09:41.582 --> 09:44.082
-Know what?
-Where I'm going.

09:44.084 --> 09:49.287
I just... I don't pick up
hitchhikers. It's just
something my mom used to say.

09:49.289 --> 09:53.191
Sure, can't be too careful
these days, right?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.860
Yeah. Well,
sorry I couldn't help.

09:57.797 --> 10:01.066
Actually, you could help.
You just chose not to.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.734
There's a difference.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.937
No worries.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.872
Always another way.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.875
Well, okay, uh,
you should look me up,

10:10.877 --> 10:13.078
if you're ever in las Vegas.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.115
You famous?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.951
Not yet, but I'm going to be.

10:22.822 --> 10:24.756
Hey, you want a ride?

10:49.116 --> 10:54.719
<i> to let me take</i>
<i> his Oscar home so I could</i>
<i> show it to Rochester.</i>

10:54.721 --> 10:56.955
<i> Hmm. Sure is dark tonight.</i>

10:56.957 --> 10:58.256
<i> No moon.</i>

10:58.258 --> 10:59.891
<i> Oh, well.</i>

11:06.132 --> 11:07.999
<i> Hey, bud. Bud.</i>

11:08.401 --> 11:09.834
<i> Huh?</i>

11:09.836 --> 11:11.369
<i> You got a match?</i>

11:11.371 --> 11:13.104
<i> Yes. Yes,</i>
<i> I have one right here</i>

11:13.106 --> 11:15.907
<i> Don't make a move,</i>
<i> this is a stick-up.</i>

11:15.909 --> 11:19.778
<i> Shut up.</i>
<i> I said this is a stick-up.</i>

11:19.780 --> 11:22.147
<i> Now come on.</i>
<i> Your money or your life.</i>

11:29.756 --> 11:32.190
I already fixed this
for you once today.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.159
I wish you'd learn to
take care of your shit.

11:34.161 --> 11:37.028
Sorry.
As Luke 12:15 says--

11:37.030 --> 11:40.198
Don't get patronizing
with me. I know what it says.

11:52.045 --> 11:56.815
Look, bud, I said
your money or your life.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.283
I'm thinking it over.

12:51.370 --> 12:55.240
You're not gonna turn out to be
some kind of pervert, are you?

12:55.242 --> 12:56.908
Oh, pervert?

12:57.476 --> 12:59.444
No. Definitely not a pervert.

12:59.446 --> 13:04.182
Well, I'd cross my heart
but my wife took that
along with the house.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.856
Oh! Thanks, man.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.792
Getting a little wet out there.

13:15.494 --> 13:16.928
Woo!

13:17.264 --> 13:21.199
This sure is one sweet bitch,
ain't she? What is she, a '52?

13:21.201 --> 13:23.835
-A '53.
-Oh, nice.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.870
I had this old Chevy once,

13:25.872 --> 13:28.273
all done up spaccano style.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.142
Fat tires, the works.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.878
My wife used to accuse me of
loving that car more than her.

13:33.880 --> 13:39.083
that's impossible.
I burned my dick
on the tailpipe."

13:39.819 --> 13:42.053
I burned my dick
on the tailpipe.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.022
-Did you have a name for it?
-What, my dick?

13:44.024 --> 13:46.491
-No, your car.
-Oh, fuck, yeah, man.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.459
Pinstriped right
across the side.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.395
"Black magic."

13:50.397 --> 13:52.363
Just like the old
Louis prima song.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.332
My mother loved Louis prima.

13:54.334 --> 13:59.304
Although, prima, he liked to
hunt the off-season beaver,

13:59.306 --> 14:03.208
He had a bone for his
16-year-old backup singer

14:03.210 --> 14:06.144
tell your mama that one.
That'll blow her skirt up.

14:06.912 --> 14:08.446
She just passed away.

14:09.249 --> 14:13.451
Look at that.
I've gone and offended you
with my off-colored dialog.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.453
You know what, I don't even
deserve your generosity.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.921
You can go ahead
and pull over right here

14:16.923 --> 14:18.356
-there ain't no hard feelings.
-No, no, no.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.627
I'm kind of relieved to
have somebody else
do all the talking actually.

14:22.629 --> 14:26.898
I... I've never picked up
a hitchhiker before.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.867
You ain't never picked up
a hitchhiker?

14:28.869 --> 14:31.169
Jesus, don't I feel like
Hitler at passover.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.872
You are truly
a selfless soul, my friend.

14:33.874 --> 14:37.942
You know what, I actually
stopped because I was curious
when I saw your sign.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.144
I mean, I guess I just... I...

14:42.548 --> 14:44.082
Name's hitch.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.151
That's my name, that's my game.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.454
Uh, Lenny.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.556
Where are you from,
"uh, Lenny"?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.558
Peoria, Illinois.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.959
How about you?

14:54.961 --> 14:56.628
Oh, I'm from all over, I guess.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.963
I've never been living
in one place for long.

14:58.965 --> 15:02.634
Only time my old man
settles is when he paid off
his bar tab.

15:02.636 --> 15:03.968
That is funny.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.403
Could I use that?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.906
<i> Mi casa, su casa.</i>

15:07.908 --> 15:09.908
That's a shame, you being solo,

15:09.910 --> 15:12.210
what with your dad dead
and no kin.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.046
How did you know that?

15:15.048 --> 15:17.649
Well, I just kind of assumed
that was the situation,

15:17.651 --> 15:20.018
you know, you living
with your mom and all.

15:20.287 --> 15:25.523
You thought I was a mind reader
there for a second, didn't you?
Made you nervous.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.026
No, man,
i ain't no mind reader.

15:28.595 --> 15:34.632
and that one up ahead that
you're about to blow through
says, "stop."

15:39.272 --> 15:44.075
I'm taking near-death
experience over sex
any day of the week!

15:44.176 --> 15:45.410
Woo!

15:53.252 --> 15:55.286
You know what,
I'd like to buy you some food.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.721
Would you like me
to do that, Lenny?

15:56.723 --> 15:58.423
You don't mind if
i call you that, do you?

15:58.425 --> 16:03.094
All right, you know what,
I'm gonna need you to
pull over right up in there.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.529
Gonna make a withdrawal.

16:15.175 --> 16:20.211
and I'm gonna leave my bag
in here with you 'cause
i trust you, Lenny.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.081
Now don't go peeking
at my private parts.

16:56.149 --> 17:00.385
Now you look to me like
someone who appreciates
a good laugh.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.521
Now, please, stop me
if you heard this one before.

17:13.665 --> 17:17.167
I've noticed you've got
a lot of old time comedy crap
in your car.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.369
My mom and I used to
memorize routines together.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.138
Mmm. Fun.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.407
Eh, too bad no one wants
to hear that shit no more.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.410
I don't know.
That material is classic.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.046
Come on, Lenny. Wake up
and smell the headlines.

17:28.048 --> 17:32.316
and they're the angry pricks
ranting about how fucked up
everything is.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.520
The more filthy, the better.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.656
I don't know.
I used to manage
a couple of jokers.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.657
You did?

17:39.659 --> 17:45.463
Always bitching about
how so and so ain't
as funny as they are,

17:45.465 --> 17:50.134
so and so stole their material,
so and so blew so and so's gig
on monte guy.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.203
I mean, who needs
that shit, right?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.404
I guess.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.408
Don't tell me.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.311
You want to be
a stand-up, don't you?

18:00.313 --> 18:03.848
I'm on my way to las Vegas
for the monte guy auditions.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.149
Are you any good?

18:05.151 --> 18:06.784
Well, my mother thought so.

18:06.786 --> 18:11.556
I'm about a real audience.
You ever headline, or you
strictly a middle man?

18:11.558 --> 18:17.562
Did you ever open for a group
of respirating humans and
make 'em laugh for money?

18:17.564 --> 18:19.163
You mean, like on a stage?

18:19.165 --> 18:20.731
Oh, no, no, no,
nothing like that.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.101
Hey, how about you open for me?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.703
But you'll have to
open real wide.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.173
Don't mind him.
He thinks he's a comedian.

18:29.175 --> 18:34.445
Yeah, I guess
your performance has been
pretty humorous lately.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.515
That supposed to be funny?

18:38.684 --> 18:40.118
Sorry.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.188
Hey, more coffee?

18:44.190 --> 18:46.224
Um, is he really a comedian?

18:46.226 --> 18:48.626
Yeah, t-bird headlines
at the yuck stop.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.529
They've got an open-mic
there every night, no cover.

18:51.531 --> 18:55.533
along with most of
the people passing through
on their way to Vegas.

18:55.535 --> 18:59.804
That is exactly where
we're headed, ain't that right?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.639
Lenny here is
looking to be famous.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.576
Oh, what a shame.
I was just starting
to like your friend.

19:07.746 --> 19:09.180
Oh, boy.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.348
She sure is pretty.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.816
Here's your big chance, Lenny.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.784
Oh, no, she would
never go out with me.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.354
The open-mic, cabbage head.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.890
Destiny is calling.
It's time to get up there
and shake your stuff.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.892
No, no, no. I've got to
get to las Vegas.

19:20.894 --> 19:24.262
I mean, if you wanna make
a complete ass of yourself

19:24.264 --> 19:25.796
before the Caesar of comedy,
that's your business,

19:25.798 --> 19:28.266
but believe you me,
i know the man,

19:28.268 --> 19:29.934
you only get one shot
in front of monte.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.371
This fucking thing
ate my money.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.374
Well, maybe if
you ask real nicely,

19:36.376 --> 19:38.576
the queen will
play us something.

19:39.611 --> 19:40.745
<i> Moi?</i>

19:42.714 --> 19:44.649
Thank you, everyone.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.284
I'd be delighted.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.587
This one's for you, grail baby.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.270
so, you really think
i ought to try out
this open-mic thing?

20:06.272 --> 20:07.805
Hey, man, it's your foreskin.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.707
I just think you're nuts to
blow your load on monte

20:09.709 --> 20:12.944
without trying out
your material on
some live cadavers, but...

20:12.946 --> 20:14.545
Do what you want.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.880
I ain't your manager.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.348
But you could be.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.484
You could be my manager, hitch.

20:21.387 --> 20:26.557
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I like you.
I like you. I do.

20:26.559 --> 20:31.329
It's just you're not exactly
cracking me up a mile a minute
over here, Lenny.

20:31.331 --> 20:35.433
and if there's something
you don't like, then
you can punch it up.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.835
Yeah, but see, it's just
not that simple, man.
You see...

20:37.837 --> 20:40.438
Comedy is like sex, right?

20:40.440 --> 20:44.709
What one person finds
enjoyable, another person
might find sick and disgusting.

20:44.711 --> 20:48.279
I couldn't go into
a relationship in which
i didn't have complete trust.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.947
Please, hitch.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.516
I have dreamt about this
my whole life.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.987
Well, I gotta warn you, Lenny,

20:55.989 --> 20:58.856
I don't enter
into contracts lightly.

20:58.858 --> 20:59.991
Oh, no, me neither.

20:59.993 --> 21:01.659
No. Cross my heart.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.764
Well, I know you got a mighty
big heart there, Lenny.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.633
Looks like we got us
a contract.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.639
Turn away from babylonia!

21:14.641 --> 21:16.007
Evening, father Ricky.

21:16.009 --> 21:18.009
Close the door before
you let the flies out.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.978
There is a deceitful prince
upon us.

21:20.980 --> 21:24.348
He will bring destruction
and despair

21:24.350 --> 21:26.784
unto god's chosen people.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.388
The time is at hand, babylonia.

21:30.390 --> 21:35.359
Yes, the time is at hand!

21:41.900 --> 21:45.603
See, these are the jokes
that got me banned
from the chuckle hut.

21:45.605 --> 21:52.076
so she tells me
my material is offensive
to the women's movement.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.445
The women's movement?
What the hell is that?

21:54.447 --> 21:56.914
Bunch of broads get together
and take a dump?

21:58.984 --> 22:01.385
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.454
I'm all about
female empowerment.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.459
The fuck are you doing?

22:11.897 --> 22:14.332
I don't understand
a fucking thing you just said.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.500
Hey, thumb master,
how about that cocktail?

22:16.502 --> 22:19.437
I said I'm going over
my routine.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.605
Why don't you do it in
fu-ba-cking English?

22:21.607 --> 22:23.441
Because this loosens my tongue.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.377
If you want a loose tongue,
suck on this.

22:26.778 --> 22:27.878
...gagging...

22:37.923 --> 22:39.457
All right, all right.

22:39.459 --> 22:43.894
How about a hand for
Mr. sensitive, t-bird!

22:45.498 --> 22:47.098
All right, all right,
look alive.

22:47.100 --> 22:50.801
It's time to switch over
to the open-mic portion
of the program.

22:50.803 --> 22:54.004
Now listen, if any of
you jokers are thinking
about coming up here,

22:54.006 --> 22:55.840
you make sure
you sign up on my list.

22:55.842 --> 22:59.677
All right! Put your hairy palms
together for our first guest.

22:59.679 --> 23:04.014
He comes to us
all the way from peoria,
wherever the fuck that is.

23:04.016 --> 23:07.685
Welcome to the stage
Mr. Lenny Freeman.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.889
Next.

24:20.158 --> 24:22.660
Uh... uh...

24:22.662 --> 24:25.095
-But you know what, I've--
-next!

24:25.097 --> 24:29.233
Come on, man,
let's see some fucking comedy.

24:29.235 --> 24:33.204
-I...Uh...
-Those jokes are so old,
they fart dust.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.206
Get off the stage.

24:35.208 --> 24:38.776
Oh, I think you
hurt his feelings, Tommy.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.480
Get off the stage.
You suck.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.549
You suck, you suck, you suck,

24:45.551 --> 24:48.652
you suck, you suck, you suck,

24:48.654 --> 24:52.122
you suck, you suck, you suck,

25:11.743 --> 25:12.910
I hate him.

25:12.912 --> 25:17.114
I hate him, and I know
it's wrong to, but I do.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.616
And I wish...

25:19.251 --> 25:21.252
I wish he was dead.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.988
Ain't nothing wrong
with hate, Lenny.

25:23.990 --> 25:27.525
No, no. Never hate or curse,
my mother always said.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.528
You see... no, man, see...

25:30.530 --> 25:34.164
Everyone's afraid to express
their real feelings.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.000
Takes a real man
to admit to hate.

25:36.736 --> 25:41.238
I mean, I have been
working hard all of my life

25:41.240 --> 25:43.007
and then he had to
go and ruin it.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.676
And I'll tell you this,
he ruined it for everyone.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.545
Oh, there, there, Princess.

25:47.547 --> 25:51.081
I mean, why would you go all
"you suck" like that?

25:51.083 --> 25:54.285
Well, that's
an easy one, Lenny.
'Cause you do.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.686
Oh, yeah, very funny.

25:55.688 --> 25:58.155
No, man, I mean,
you suck real bad.

25:58.157 --> 26:02.560
Real bad. I mean some people
just plain suck-suck, you take
sucking to a whole new level.

26:02.562 --> 26:05.629
It's almost spiritual,
how amazingly you suck.

26:05.631 --> 26:08.032
-Oh.
-That don't mean...

26:08.034 --> 26:11.101
That we can't whip your ass
into shape for ol' monte.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.805
Maybe I should just go home.

26:14.807 --> 26:20.344
Oh, now cheer up, buckaroo.
You don't wanna let your dear
sweet mama down, do you?

26:20.346 --> 26:22.746
The worst is over man.
You bombed.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.815
So what, man, happens
to the best of them.

26:24.817 --> 26:28.786
What's that old saying?
At first you don't succeed,
fuck 'em.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.755
I don't know that one.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.157
But you know what, Lenny,

26:33.925 --> 26:35.626
you got to get mad.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.362
You gotta get mad, and get
right back out there.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.764
Example. It's like
I'm on the road, right?

26:40.766 --> 26:46.804
some four-wheel double-engine
douchebag gives me
the "sorry, not today" salute.

26:46.806 --> 26:50.841
You know what I do?
I get mad.

26:51.076 --> 26:52.743
I get mad.

26:52.745 --> 26:57.948
I think about all the things
I'd do to that first car if
i ever caught up with him.

26:57.950 --> 27:02.653
I go over it and over it
in my mind. Every
teensy-weensy little detail.

27:02.655 --> 27:07.725
The pressure on the ball
of my foot as I grind my boot
into his Adam's apple.

27:07.727 --> 27:11.695
The look in his eyes
as I plunge my thumbs
in his sockets.

27:11.697 --> 27:15.666
The snap, crackle, pop
of his skull as I crack it
open like a cantaloupe

27:15.668 --> 27:17.968
and squeeze the life
out of his temporal lobe,

27:17.970 --> 27:21.205
inch by inch by inch.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.110
Killing is a sin.

27:26.112 --> 27:29.380
Man, killing a man in
your mind ain't like killing
a man for real, Lenny.

27:29.382 --> 27:30.781
It's like...

27:32.350 --> 27:34.084
It's like therapy.

27:35.086 --> 27:36.820
Trust me, little tune up...

27:39.224 --> 27:40.991
You're gonna be
good as new.

27:42.894 --> 27:45.162
Well, thanks, hitch.
I feel better.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.964
I'm gonna go throw up now.

28:13.725 --> 28:16.694
Yeah.

28:26.271 --> 28:27.871
I hate him.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.320
What are you looking at,
dick head?

28:47.792 --> 28:49.727
Now, that's funny.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.765
Aw, nuts.

29:28.366 --> 29:29.933
What's the problemo?

29:29.935 --> 29:32.069
I got a stupid flat tire.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.505
Oh, I don't know, I'd be
happy to help you, Lenny,

29:34.507 --> 29:36.907
but I ain't supposed to
be out in the sun.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.510
Doctor's orders.

29:39.512 --> 29:43.213
Besides, I should
probably get ready to puke here
in just a minute.

29:43.215 --> 29:45.349
Okay, but don't mess up
my car, okay?

29:45.351 --> 29:47.918
I just had everything taken...

29:47.920 --> 29:50.854
Leonard, don't tell me
the spare is flat too.

29:52.490 --> 29:53.857
Oh, boy.

29:59.564 --> 30:02.900
What the hell did you do,
Lenny? I didn't mean for you
to kill the fucker.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.135
I didn't. I don't...
I don't know. I...

30:05.137 --> 30:10.073
He... he came out of the club,
and... and he was urinating
and I was regurgitating and...

30:10.075 --> 30:12.209
-I don't remember!
-Hey!

30:12.977 --> 30:15.012
Piss off! We're closed.

30:16.047 --> 30:19.116
I'm just fixing a flat tire.
I'm leaving right now.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.951
Oh, it's you.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.586
You really sucked last night.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.088
Yes, I know. Thank you!

30:25.090 --> 30:28.125
Oh, hitch,
what am I gonna do?

30:28.127 --> 30:31.161
I don't want to go to prison
and have sex with men.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.930
You should have thought
of that before you decided

30:32.932 --> 30:35.399
to play don't break the ice
with his head.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.135
Please, hitch,
you gotta help me.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.906
The things I do for my clients.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.877
Come on.

33:40.284 --> 33:42.586
fucking tragedy,
that's what it is.

33:43.622 --> 33:50.093
Putting up another money trap
in the middle of all
this fucking beauty.

33:50.095 --> 33:52.095
Not that I'm a big fan
of desert, mind you.

33:52.097 --> 33:54.431
Too much sun,
and I'm a dead man.

33:55.233 --> 33:58.568
Yep. Might burn like
a Salem witch.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.471
I hate the fuckin' desert.

34:01.473 --> 34:06.676
Still, it's a shame though,
ripping up a bunch of cactus
for some big neon igloo

34:06.678 --> 34:09.612
filled with free cocktails,
silicon tits.

34:09.614 --> 34:15.518
You know how many lives are
ruined by gambling every year,
statistically speaking?

34:15.521 --> 34:18.487
A fucking lot.
That's how many.

34:18.489 --> 34:23.193
Shits like cholesterol
gets in your arteries,
and you are fucked.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.661
Except of course,
in gambling, you can
still eat bacon.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.563
Aren't you listening?

34:27.565 --> 34:29.399
I killed a person.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.302
I... I killed him, and then
i cut him up...

34:32.304 --> 34:34.704
And then I buried him,
and then I un-buried him...

34:34.706 --> 34:37.574
Now I can't get rid of him
and I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.777
Well, if you'd stop
thinking about yourself for
a fucking nanosecond,

34:40.779 --> 34:44.313
you'd see that
I'm over here trying to
draw situational analogies

34:44.315 --> 34:47.684
to help you see that you're
not the only guy in the world
with fucking problems.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.290
I'm sorry.

34:53.292 --> 34:58.095
I know you're under a lot of
stress with this recent
dismemberment thing and all.

34:58.097 --> 34:59.629
Oh, hey, what time is it?

35:01.633 --> 35:05.802
Perfect. Gonna be back
just in time for open-mic.

35:05.804 --> 35:11.341
Hey, you gotta trust me
now, Lenny. You gotta get
back up on that horse.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.777
No, no, no. We gotta get
out of here. No, I have to
go on the lam.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.712
-The lam?
-Yes. I have to...

35:15.714 --> 35:19.382
Grow a beard, and I have to
drive to Mexico or something.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.418
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow down there, Thelma.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.855
You don't understand.
Hitch, I have never
been in trouble.

35:24.857 --> 35:27.157
And now I'm in the worst
kind of trouble ever.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.325
No, you ain't, Lenny.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.227
-Yes, I am, hitch.
-No, you ain't.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.863
-Yes, I am, hitch.
-No, you ain't, Lenny.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.468
Okay.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.536
Now you are.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.617
Here. Let me see. Here.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.654
Act natural.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.202
I know what you're thinking.

36:12.204 --> 36:15.205
Whether you're on 65 or 50,

36:15.207 --> 36:19.576
well, to tell you the truth,
in all of this excitement,
i kinda forgot myself.

36:19.578 --> 36:22.646
So you've got to
ask yourself one thing.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.281
Do you feel lucky?

36:24.649 --> 36:27.450
Well, do ya, punk?

36:32.623 --> 36:34.324
All right.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.928
Out of the car there, pilgrim.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.530
Hands where I can see 'em.

36:55.279 --> 36:57.681
Now I know this might
seem a bit odd, officer,

36:57.683 --> 37:00.984
but the reason my friend
here is such a mess is
we were just--

37:00.986 --> 37:02.619
you talkin' to me?

37:04.789 --> 37:07.791
Well, you must be talkin'
to me. There isn't
anyone else here.

37:09.927 --> 37:11.628
Let's see what's in the trunk.

37:15.466 --> 37:16.600
Go ahead.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.802
Make my afternoon.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.606
Go ahead, Lenny.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.308
Pop the trunk.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.685
Just means we're gonna be
late for your performance.

37:36.855 --> 37:40.590
That's right, officer.
My friend here is a performer,

37:40.592 --> 37:42.425
and this is all
part of his routine.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.262
Not that that should excuse us
from breaking the law.

37:46.999 --> 37:51.334
Yes, indeed. Now... now,
if I'm not mistaken,

37:51.336 --> 37:56.439
you got a little performer
in you yourself, don't you,
officer, uh, flick, is it?

37:56.941 --> 37:58.408
You noticed, did you?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.644
Hey, you know what,
i got a great idea.

38:00.646 --> 38:04.314
How about you join us
as our guest tonight
at the club?

38:04.316 --> 38:05.715
You see,
we're all true as toast.

38:07.885 --> 38:10.487
'Course, we are
running a tad late.

38:28.773 --> 38:30.540
Yeah.

38:30.542 --> 38:34.611
Yeah. Don't get me started on
all that glass ceiling shit.

38:34.613 --> 38:38.915
Women. They all wanna talk
about the glass ceiling. Don't
get ahead of yourself, okay?

38:38.917 --> 38:42.052
Let's start small.
Let's talk about the glass
coffee table first.

38:42.054 --> 38:46.823
That's where you're on top
and I'm underneath,
taking pictures.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.593
Oh, you've got
a nice smile there.

38:51.796 --> 38:54.064
Oh, I got a lil' smudge...

38:58.636 --> 38:59.869
Oh, what, too far?

38:59.871 --> 39:02.605
That was too far for you?
Okay, okay.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.974
Hey, just so you ladies
don't think I'm a total cad,

39:04.976 --> 39:07.844
I'm gonna buy one of you
a drink. Which one of you
wants a drink?

39:07.846 --> 39:11.681
Yeah, I'll give you a...
I'll get you a nice
little drink here.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.816
You know.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.886
Oh, yeah.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.756
You want some
of this, baby? Huh?

39:19.758 --> 39:20.924
Oh, yeah.

39:33.938 --> 39:35.805
There you go, darling.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.841
There you go.
Come on.

39:37.843 --> 39:40.510
Bottoms up.
I'm t-bird.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.785
The one and only t-bird.

39:51.455 --> 39:54.090
All right, all right,
all right,
settle the fuck down.

39:54.092 --> 39:58.061
All right, we have
a special guest back
with us for open-mic.

39:58.063 --> 40:02.499
Some of you might
remember his... his
stunning debut last night.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.769
Please welcome to the stage,
for more abuse,

40:06.804 --> 40:08.104
Lenny Freeman.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.982
Um, I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.058
I just killed a guy.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.530
H... he was heckling me.

41:10.734 --> 41:13.803
Then I... I had to learn
the hard way that...

41:13.805 --> 41:17.540
It's pretty difficult
getting rid of a body
these days.

41:22.079 --> 41:26.216
I cut him up into...
Pieces, but...

41:26.218 --> 41:30.119
That's what I had to do
just to get him into
that tiny little hole.

41:30.121 --> 41:33.256
He was much bigger
than I thought.

41:35.926 --> 41:37.227
Maybe it's the...

41:37.229 --> 41:39.162
Today's portion sizes,
i don't know.

41:44.268 --> 41:48.738
You know what...You know what
the hardest part about cutting
someone into pieces is?

41:49.940 --> 41:51.107
It's the bones.

41:59.683 --> 42:02.585
No, really. The bones
were the hardest part.

42:17.835 --> 42:19.035
It's me.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.170
You got a lot of nerve.

42:21.172 --> 42:25.241
<i> I take you into my kingdom,</i>
<i> and this is how you</i>
<i> fucking repay me?</i>

42:25.243 --> 42:28.077
It was a mistake.
I'm gonna pay you back,
every cent.

42:28.079 --> 42:31.047
<i> Goodbye, Stan.</i>
<i> We all know how</i>
<i> this is gonna end.</i>

42:31.049 --> 42:32.148
Wait. Wait. Hey.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.716
I got something for you.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.952
A live one.
I've been grooming him.

42:41.625 --> 42:44.627
If you're looking for
your friend, he's gone.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.863
Asked me to give you this.

42:48.132 --> 42:51.067
That's some funny stuff
up there tonight, Mr. Freeman.

42:51.069 --> 42:57.974
I always wanted to get up
on stage myself. I just
never had the guts.

42:57.976 --> 43:02.645
I bet you think I'm
some kind of coward
hiding behind this badge.

43:03.981 --> 43:06.950
Well, duty calls.

43:06.952 --> 43:09.752
Some old lady queer
cracked her head at mini-mart.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.788
Found her dead
in the freezer case.

43:14.725 --> 43:16.593
Good luck, Mr. Freeman.

43:18.662 --> 43:20.697
Here's looking at you, kid.

43:51.895 --> 43:54.030
-What are you doing here?
-Put these on.

43:54.032 --> 43:56.899
-Why?
-Why do you think?
To keep a low profile.

43:59.103 --> 44:00.169
There.

44:00.171 --> 44:01.904
-What are you doing?
-Celebrating.

44:01.906 --> 44:04.173
-Pink squirrel?
-No. We've got to
get out of here.

44:04.175 --> 44:07.644
-Are you crazy?
-Of course, I'm crazy.
I just killed a man.

44:07.646 --> 44:09.679
Whoa, slow down there,
gentle John.

44:09.681 --> 44:11.014
I don't know
what's happening to me.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.249
I'll tell you what's
happening to you, Lenny.

44:13.251 --> 44:18.388
You heard that crowd tonight.
That was a killer set,
my friend.

44:18.390 --> 44:21.691
Yeah, but I chopped up
a human being.

44:21.693 --> 44:23.760
He wasn't a human being.
He was a biker.

44:23.762 --> 44:28.197
Man, don't you see what's
going on here? You got
exactly what you wanted.

44:28.199 --> 44:29.666
What'll it be, gentlemen?

44:29.668 --> 44:31.000
Uh, you serve food here?

44:31.002 --> 44:36.272
Uh, let's get a couple
of menus, please, and
another one of these.

44:36.274 --> 44:37.740
Mm-hmm.

44:38.275 --> 44:40.076
I'll put it in a dribble glass.

44:43.914 --> 44:45.915
Hitch, this is not
what I wanted.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.884
You said you wanted
to be famous.

44:49.053 --> 44:50.286
No. I mean...

44:51.289 --> 44:56.826
It's just, I don't know
anymore because everything
is just wrong.

44:56.828 --> 45:00.129
Okay. There, there,
let it all out.

45:01.098 --> 45:04.067
You know, I wasn't gonna
tell you this, but...

45:04.069 --> 45:08.071
Now, would it make you feel
any better if I told you
that I killed the guy?

45:09.173 --> 45:10.406
You're just trying to be nice.

45:10.408 --> 45:15.344
No. No. You see,
you passed out, and I...

45:15.346 --> 45:18.881
Well, I kinda bashed
the guy's head in
with a tire-arm.

45:19.450 --> 45:20.717
Needed to be done.

45:20.719 --> 45:22.251
Now, come on.
Blow your nose.

45:22.253 --> 45:23.319
There you go.

45:29.860 --> 45:33.463
-You... you killed for real?
-Mm-hmm.

45:33.465 --> 45:35.064
You feel better now?

45:35.066 --> 45:36.833
Oh, wow.

45:36.835 --> 45:39.335
That's great.
That means I'm not a murderer.

45:42.372 --> 45:44.207
Oh, wait a minute.

45:44.209 --> 45:45.908
That makes you a murderer.

45:46.878 --> 45:50.079
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think
you're going?

45:50.081 --> 45:52.181
I won't tell anyone, hitch.
I swear. I swear.

45:52.183 --> 45:54.417
I mean, if you kill somebody,
you must be having
a good reason.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.285
-Of course, I do.
-So, what's the verdict?

45:56.754 --> 45:58.254
Uh, nothing.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.856
Hey, don't I know you?

45:59.858 --> 46:01.290
Could you come back
later, please?

46:01.292 --> 46:02.492
I did it for you, Lenny.

46:02.494 --> 46:04.494
-How about you, Mr. pink?
-Just toast, please.

46:04.496 --> 46:05.862
What do you mean
you did it for me?

46:05.864 --> 46:07.230
You said you wished
he was dead.

46:07.232 --> 46:11.868
If you want just toast,
you have to order just
chicken salad.

46:11.870 --> 46:13.269
But I didn't ask you
to do anything.

46:13.271 --> 46:16.105
-But I don't want
just chicken salad.
-Hitch.

46:16.107 --> 46:18.241
The chicken salad
comes toasted.
I suggest you order.

46:18.243 --> 46:20.977
-Hitch.
-Or the lettuce, tomato,
and mayonnaise.

46:20.979 --> 46:23.446
-Hitch.
-What do I do
with the chicken salad?

46:23.448 --> 46:26.449
Why don't you hold it
between your knees?

46:26.451 --> 46:28.284
I am not a part of any of this.

46:40.264 --> 46:41.264
Now you are.

46:41.266 --> 46:42.465
Come on, get up.

46:42.467 --> 46:49.005
Now, any of you assholes want
a couple of new assholes
and start making macho.

46:52.176 --> 46:54.143
Thank you, everybody.
You've been a great audience.

46:54.145 --> 46:57.413
Now, please, don't forget
to tip your waitresses.

47:12.896 --> 47:14.230
You feel better now?

47:17.935 --> 47:20.303
Oh, that's real mature.

47:20.305 --> 47:22.071
Do you realize what you did?

47:22.073 --> 47:26.442
Maybe she'll think twice about
lipping off in the afterlife.

47:26.444 --> 47:30.580
Which means that everyone is
gonna have a different story.

47:30.582 --> 47:32.215
That's the beauty of crowds.

47:32.217 --> 47:33.916
This is insane!

47:33.918 --> 47:35.484
You gave me no choice.
You were about to run.

47:35.486 --> 47:36.886
I had to think fast.

47:36.888 --> 47:39.488
Now, you're not going anywhere.

47:39.490 --> 47:40.890
Now you're an accomplice.

47:40.892 --> 47:42.525
Oh, no. No, no.
I didn't do anything.

47:42.527 --> 47:45.161
Oh, i didn't do anything.
 I didn't do anything.

47:45.163 --> 47:47.430
Man, you are starting to
sound like a broken 8-track.

47:47.432 --> 47:49.565
Don't you remember
our little deal over din-din?

47:49.567 --> 47:53.236
Oh, hitch, I would do anything
if you help me.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

47:53.238 --> 47:55.905
Man, you finally got
what you wanted.

47:55.907 --> 47:57.907
You're a fucking
comic sensation.

47:57.909 --> 48:00.076
You should be happy as
a super model's panty shield.

48:00.078 --> 48:03.312
Do I get so much
as a thank you?
No, I do not.

48:03.314 --> 48:05.281
Thank you? For what?

48:05.283 --> 48:08.351
You have killed a bunch
of innocent people.

48:08.353 --> 48:12.588
No one in this world
is innocent, Lenny,
only uninvolved.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.391
Consider yourself involved.

48:15.393 --> 48:18.327
Now you've finally got
a little inspiration, man.

48:18.329 --> 48:21.130
And it's in that trunk
any time you need it.

48:21.431 --> 48:22.632
Okay.

48:22.634 --> 48:24.367
Okay. Take the car.

48:24.369 --> 48:28.938
Well, I appreciate the offer,
Lenny, but see, I don't drive.

48:29.507 --> 48:33.576
You know how many people get
killed behind the wheel of
one of them things every year,

48:33.578 --> 48:35.978
statistically speaking, I mean?

48:35.980 --> 48:38.180
A fucking lot. That's how many.

48:38.182 --> 48:42.652
Nope. I'm afraid there's only
one way out of our contract.

48:42.654 --> 48:44.987
I don't think
you got the acorns.

48:44.989 --> 48:47.356
-Anything. I'll do it.
-Oh yeah?

48:47.358 --> 48:49.091
-Yes.
-Yeah? Okay.

48:50.427 --> 48:53.229
Here. Here you go.
Come on!

48:53.231 --> 48:55.665
Come on, Mr. money-where-
your-mouth-is. Come on.

48:55.667 --> 48:57.433
Yeah, all right, come on.

48:58.201 --> 48:59.568
There you go.

48:59.570 --> 49:01.470
There you go. Do it, Lenny.

49:01.472 --> 49:02.939
Splatter the matter!

49:02.941 --> 49:06.275
One squeeze, and you're
a free man, Freeman.

49:06.277 --> 49:09.946
Oh, yeah, that feels nice,
don't it, being the one
in control?

49:09.948 --> 49:11.447
Yeah, come on, Lenny, do it.

49:11.449 --> 49:14.283
Do it. You know I ain't right
for this world, Lenny.

49:14.551 --> 49:16.152
Do it.

49:16.154 --> 49:17.386
Do it!

49:24.628 --> 49:26.195
Oh, man.

49:27.431 --> 49:29.031
Got you.

49:30.600 --> 49:31.968
Oh, man.

49:31.970 --> 49:33.502
Now that's funny.

49:37.708 --> 49:39.709
Whether you like it or not,

49:39.711 --> 49:42.011
we're a team, partner,

49:42.446 --> 49:44.413
just like bing and Jerry.

50:39.037 --> 50:43.105
in trying to cut out,
i might have every trooper
within a hundred miles

50:43.107 --> 50:46.575
crawling through that
trunk of yours like gerbils
in an ass convention.

50:46.577 --> 50:48.544
Please don't kill anyone.

50:48.546 --> 50:52.181
Anyway, Lenny, just
to prove to you that
I'm a man of my word,

50:52.183 --> 50:55.051
I'm gonna leave my gun
in the glove compartment.

50:57.287 --> 51:00.289
How do I know
that's the real one?

51:00.291 --> 51:02.658
Well, if you pull the trigger
when it's in your mouth,

51:02.660 --> 51:05.394
and it opens a hole
about yea big,

51:05.396 --> 51:06.595
then you know.

51:16.540 --> 51:18.741
Come on, now.
There you go.
Keep 'em up.

51:18.743 --> 51:21.377
You look to me like someone
who appreciates a good laugh.

51:21.379 --> 51:23.646
Now stop me if you
heard this one before.

51:33.590 --> 51:35.157
Read the...

51:35.159 --> 51:36.258
Never mind. Come on.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.360
Come on. Come on, let's go.

51:43.800 --> 51:45.434
Are you going somewhere?

51:45.436 --> 51:47.103
Was I speeding, officer?

51:54.277 --> 51:55.411
No. No.

51:57.180 --> 51:59.348
-'52?
-'53.

51:59.716 --> 52:01.217
It's nice.

52:03.253 --> 52:05.221
I used to have an oldsmobile.

52:05.223 --> 52:06.856
I remember it had
a lot of trunk space.

52:09.293 --> 52:13.729
Why don't we use
this spare tire in place
of this spare tire,

52:13.731 --> 52:16.298
while we wait for
your friend to get done
with his business?

52:20.738 --> 52:22.638
Sweet mother of--

52:38.388 --> 52:39.655
Now, get up.

52:40.924 --> 52:42.558
It's showtime.

52:58.508 --> 53:00.209
And the...

53:00.211 --> 53:02.545
And then
the next thing I notice,

53:02.547 --> 53:04.513
there's blood everywhere.

53:06.517 --> 53:09.218
I mean... everywhere...

53:09.220 --> 53:11.854
Except inside of him anymore.

53:15.625 --> 53:18.394
Then... to make matters worse,

53:18.396 --> 53:20.629
I'm running out
of clean shirts.

53:24.601 --> 53:28.837
Maybe like if...
If you would eat a lobster
without a bib on...

53:30.474 --> 53:34.543
Except... except
the difference is that...

53:34.545 --> 53:37.379
When you crack open
a lobster, it doesn't...

53:37.381 --> 53:40.282
Scream for its life
and spray blood everywhere.

53:52.696 --> 53:54.697
If it... did...

53:54.699 --> 53:57.299
I think there's be a lot
less seafood restaurants.

54:01.304 --> 54:04.673
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

54:04.675 --> 54:07.676
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

54:07.678 --> 54:10.646
Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

54:31.735 --> 54:34.503
Hey, hey, hey.
Where are you going, sunshine?

54:34.505 --> 54:36.005
-I quit.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

54:36.007 --> 54:37.873
Is this any way
to treat your manager?

54:37.875 --> 54:40.476
Okay. You are not my manager.

54:40.478 --> 54:42.911
You are a cold-blooded killer.
That's what you are.

54:42.913 --> 54:46.415
Sticks and stones, Lenny,
sticks and stones.

54:46.417 --> 54:47.483
Hey, man.

54:47.485 --> 54:48.884
Would you sign this for me?

54:48.886 --> 54:51.487
-Huh?
-I mean, you know,
for when you're famous.

54:51.489 --> 54:54.690
How can you
leave all this, Lenny?

54:54.692 --> 54:57.026
Hey, tell you what, Lenny,
I'm gonna take tonight's drama

54:57.028 --> 54:59.428
to get us a nice spread
over at that flea palace

54:59.430 --> 55:02.331
they call "motel
biggest-room-they-got". Huh?

55:02.333 --> 55:03.899
Let you rest up for tomorrow.

55:03.901 --> 55:05.401
No.

55:06.369 --> 55:07.569
No?

55:09.306 --> 55:10.673
What do you mean no?

55:10.675 --> 55:12.908
I am turning myself in.

55:12.910 --> 55:15.077
You are not going
anywhere, asshole.

55:15.079 --> 55:16.445
And you wanna know why?

55:16.447 --> 55:19.014
Because I think you like it.

55:19.016 --> 55:21.917
That's right, Lenny boy,
i saw you up there.

55:21.919 --> 55:23.986
You got a taste now.

55:23.988 --> 55:25.688
It's in your system.

55:26.790 --> 55:30.326
So let's drop this charade.

55:30.328 --> 55:33.629
You couldn't walk away now
even if you tried.

55:34.664 --> 55:37.066
Hey! There he is.

55:37.068 --> 55:39.501
I just got a call
from monte's people.

55:39.503 --> 55:42.071
They're sending someone down
to take a look.

55:42.073 --> 55:44.873
No more open-mic
for you, Freeman.

55:44.875 --> 55:46.775
Bumping you up to headliner.

55:52.082 --> 55:56.352
You still wanna leave,
Mr. headliner?

55:57.420 --> 55:59.521
I didn't think so.

56:01.891 --> 56:05.861
Let me give you a little
piece of advice
my father once gave me.

56:06.830 --> 56:08.564
Son...

56:08.566 --> 56:11.767
You need to go out
and get laid or something.

56:14.838 --> 56:17.439
Think about it.

56:17.441 --> 56:20.642
I'll be back at the motel
when you come to your senses.

56:39.729 --> 56:43.098
You know, I've seen
a man bend a spoon
just by staring at it,

56:43.100 --> 56:45.968
but never a meatloaf.

56:46.971 --> 56:50.939
Oh, hey, you're the guy
that took t-bird's place
at the club.

56:50.941 --> 56:52.574
News travels fast.

56:52.576 --> 56:54.777
I thought you were
heading to Vegas or something.

56:54.779 --> 56:56.478
I was...

56:56.480 --> 56:57.913
I can't go right now.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.581
Doesn't surprise me.

56:59.583 --> 57:01.884
Nobody ever leaves this place.

57:01.886 --> 57:03.118
Are you done with this?

57:03.120 --> 57:08.490
I was just
gonna sit here a while.
Do you mind?

57:08.492 --> 57:14.830
I mean, as you can see,
we have quite a high demand
for this table tonight.

57:15.632 --> 57:16.732
Oh.

57:18.802 --> 57:20.502
Here you go.

57:20.504 --> 57:22.805
And don't worry about it.

57:22.807 --> 57:23.906
It's on the house.

57:23.908 --> 57:25.040
Thank you.

57:25.042 --> 57:26.708
What happened to your arm?

57:28.445 --> 57:31.046
Oh. Nothing.

57:31.048 --> 57:33.749
You know, I must have like
whacked it on the grill
or something. It...

57:33.751 --> 57:35.918
It gets pretty greasy
back there.

57:35.920 --> 57:40.055
Or I'm just... I'm just
plain clumsy.

57:40.057 --> 57:45.961
When I was a kid,
my dad used to tell everybody
that I was clumsy too.

57:45.963 --> 57:51.467
Except he would tell everybody
that I got whacked by a door,
not a grill.

57:52.101 --> 57:53.569
Oh.

57:53.571 --> 57:56.205
You know, it was funny
because after he died,

57:56.207 --> 57:58.707
I stopped being
so clumsy all the time.

57:59.709 --> 58:01.910
Bet that means
you're pretty happy.

58:03.012 --> 58:04.880
Not really. Uh...

58:04.882 --> 58:09.818
I mean I was glad that
i wasn't, you know,
so "clumsy" anymore, but,

58:09.820 --> 58:11.086
I miss my dad.

58:12.121 --> 58:14.923
Um... you must think
this is strange.

58:15.124 --> 58:16.692
No.

58:18.561 --> 58:20.162
It doesn't sound strange
at all.

58:21.165 --> 58:25.968
What the fuck?
I've been waiting outside
for ten minutes.

58:25.970 --> 58:27.803
Let's go.

58:28.905 --> 58:31.139
I'm sorry. I have to go.

58:31.141 --> 58:33.842
It was really nice
talking with you, um...

58:33.844 --> 58:34.810
Lenny.

58:34.812 --> 58:36.578
-Lenny.
-Yeah.

58:36.580 --> 58:38.981
-Grail.
-Oh, that's so pretty.

58:38.983 --> 58:39.982
Irish?

58:39.984 --> 58:41.016
Typo.

58:43.086 --> 58:44.786
Watch out for that grill.

58:53.596 --> 58:55.264
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

58:55.266 --> 58:58.800
Love must be deaf and dumb,
as well as blind.

58:59.168 --> 59:00.669
I guess.

59:00.671 --> 59:02.137
Hey, are you gonna eat that?

59:02.139 --> 59:03.906
Oh, all yours.

59:05.275 --> 59:08.143
What is this stuff?
I'm a strict vegetarian.

59:08.145 --> 59:12.114
Oh, well, let's just
eat around the bad parts.

59:13.182 --> 59:15.284
Oh, by the way,
my friends call me tq.

59:15.286 --> 59:17.786
Oh. Lenny. Hi.

59:19.924 --> 59:23.258
Don't worry.
She'll be all right.

59:23.260 --> 59:25.027
Oh, no, I'm not looking at her.

59:25.029 --> 59:29.164
you lit up like
a plastic snowman when
she was talking to you.

59:29.166 --> 59:32.768
Before that, you were like
some kind of walking
poster child for despair.

59:32.770 --> 59:34.870
I'm sorry. I guess I just
have a lot on my mind.

59:34.872 --> 59:39.007
Well, if there's something
i learned about
this nasty old world,

59:39.009 --> 59:43.579
it's that you do best
by ignoring everything
the mind has to tell you,

59:43.581 --> 59:46.582
and paying a little closer
attention to the heart.

59:47.584 --> 59:49.184
The heart knows what it wants.

59:50.754 --> 59:55.123
Mmm. That man sure does have
a gift for the obvious.

59:55.125 --> 59:57.326
Maybe somebody
should do something.

59:57.328 --> 59:59.127
Maybe someone should.

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.066
I told you,
we were just talking.

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:05.200
Just talking?

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.868
Yeah. About what?

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:09.805
About how your friend
in there took my spot?

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.140
You're drunk.

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:14.209
Don't lie to me, grail.

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:17.012
Get your hands off me, please.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.680
You heard her.

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.349
Get your hands off.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.053
Well, if it isn't
the king of comedy.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.724
Look, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:30.626
Just... just leave her alone.

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:34.963
This isn't any of
your fucking business.

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:40.035
Maybe I'm making it
my business.

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:44.373
Please, Lenny,
go back inside.

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:47.242
Sorry. I can't do that.

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:51.179
Yeah. Why don't you
enlighten us? Tell us
what you were gonna do.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.782
You really wanna know?

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:58.053
Yeah, gimme the gory details.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:00.188
Okay, uh...

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.057
Now let's see. Um...

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.793
Why don't I, uh...

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:10.832
Why don't I start with
the pressure from
the ball of my foot

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:14.836
as I grind my shoe
down in your Adam's apple?

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.673
Or the look in your eyes

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:22.277
as I slowly plunge my thumbs
into your sockets?

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:25.981
Or maybe it'll be the snap,
crackle, pop of your skull

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:28.150
as I crack it open
like a cantaloupe

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:32.020
and I squeeze the life
out of your temporal lobe,

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:35.290
inch by inch by inch.

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.896
You're fucking weird.
You know that?

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.769
We'll talk about this later.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:02:00.182
You know, you ought to
seek some professional help,
you know that?

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.903
Go ahead, son.

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.473
Go ahead with what?

01:02:24.475 --> 01:02:26.241
With your confession.

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:33.982
Sorry,<i> padre,</i>
i just came in here for
some peace and quiet.

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:37.285
Besides, I got
nothing to confess.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:41.389
"Without confession,
vengeance is mine to repay,"

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.258
says the lord.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.260
The hell is that
supposed to mean?

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.964
It means
you're not gonna
win here, asshole.

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:56.004
Well, I'd love to
chew the fat with you, father,
but I beg to differ.

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:59.141
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:14.022
- <i> Yes, yes, Charlie,</i>
<i> that's nothing to sing about.</i>

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:15.891
<i> You ought to be</i>
<i> ashamed of yourself.</i>

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:18.527
<i> A boy your age,</i>
<i> with a jail record.</i>

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:21.863
<i> Just call me</i>
<i> number 77682.</i>

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:25.066
<i> Let's hope</i>
<i> this incident doesn't</i>
<i> get into the newspapers.</i>

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:26.802
I don't get it.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.436
You said this guy
is a ventriloquist?

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:30.205
Oh, oh, he was.
He's dead now.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:34.876
I mean, a ventriloquist
on the radio? You can't even
tell if his lips are moving.

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:36.845
That's the beauty of it.
It doesn't matter.

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:39.948
Now, that's when there was
a real art to comedy.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.950
I guess.

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:51.026
I wanna thank you for what
you did back there, Lenny.

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:54.563
Oh, sure, no...
It was no big deal.

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:57.265
You know, he wasn't always
like that, you know.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:58.567
Hmm.

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:03.104
You kind of remind me of him.

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:06.942
Yeah, he was gonna
tear up the town and
hit straight for the strip.

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:08.844
Now I think he's...

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.378
Just afraid to leave.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:11.980
Yeah, well,
i know that feeling.

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:14.082
You know we had gotten it
all figured out.

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:18.920
He was gonna work at the clubs
and I was gonna deal Blackjack.

01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:21.022
Perfect little Vegas couple.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.926
Now when I see
those lights, it's...

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:27.262
It's like a cruel joke.
It's like, just...

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:30.165
Keeping a dog's food
out of reach of its chain.

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.603
You know how to deal Blackjack?

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:39.207
Yeah. No, I mean, it's just
like waitressing. You just
have to remember things.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:43.178
You know, do you want fries
with that, do you wanna
split your eggs.

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.614
Mmm.

01:04:45.616 --> 01:04:46.948
You wanna play a hand?

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.618
That's okay. We can
play with our hands.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.119
All right. Hit me.

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.487
Wait, no, I have to deal first.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:54.356
-Right.
-Here come your cards.

01:04:54.358 --> 01:04:56.124
It's a three and an eight.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:59.961
-Hit me.
-No, not so fast,
you gotta put your bet.

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:02.964
Dealer shows a four,
odds are I'm gonna bust,
you got an 11.

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:06.101
You should double down,
odds are you'll draw a ten,
and double your money.

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.069
Okay. I am doubling down
in my head.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.405
Here comes your card,
and it's...

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.941
Ah, three of clubs.

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:15.977
No, those are just the odds.
You got a three.

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:17.913
-Oh, can I have another card?
-No. You doubled down.

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:20.482
Well, why don't you
switch it to a ten in
your hands so that I win?

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:23.184
Do you wanna get me fired?
There are cameras
all over this place.

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:27.622
No. You're just gonna
have to live with a three.

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:29.157
Okay. I guess.

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:33.228
Dealer draws a four
and a nine, 13.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:34.596
-Dealer draws again.
-What is it?

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.531
-A two.
-Shoot, you win.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:37.933
Oh wait, no, not so fast.

01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:39.668
Dealer must draw
on 16 and below.

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:41.536
House rules.
Says so right on the table.

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:43.238
Didn't you read
the table, Lenny?

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.307
Dealer draws...

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:48.510
An Ace, 16.

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:50.378
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.348
Final draw, and it's a...

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:54.549
Six.

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:55.583
Twenty-two.

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:57.152
-Dealer busts. You win.
-I won!

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:58.954
- You win!
- Oh, my god.

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.255
I've never won anything.

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:01.523
Oh, wow!

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:07.295
You're funny, Lenny.

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:22.043
We should go. Right now.

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:26.581
Forget what I said.
We could go now,
be in Vegas by morning.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:27.749
You're teasing.

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:32.120
Let's do it. I mean,
let's do it now or
maybe it'll be like you said

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:33.488
and we'll never
get out of here.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.589
You know I have to think.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:39.461
-I bet your car
will never make it.
-I'll make it.

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:42.097
-Is it a '52?
-'53.

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:43.198
Nice.

01:06:57.447 --> 01:06:59.414
what am I doing?
I don't even know
what I'm doing.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.216
It's okay. Neither do I.

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.487
-Promise me, Lenny.
-I promise.

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:08.390
-You won't just up and leave?
-No. Never.

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.494
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What?

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:15.363
I'm gonna turn the heat on.
Your right hand is freezing.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.464
Don't be silly.

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:31.079
What?

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:32.647
I have to leave!

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:34.516
Get out of my car!

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:38.319
Get out of my car!
Get out of my car!
Get out of my car!

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:46.795
You jerk face!

01:07:46.797 --> 01:07:49.197
I thought you were
a nice person.

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:51.132
I thought you were different.

01:07:51.134 --> 01:07:55.770
But you're not!
You're the opposite, in fact.
You're un-nice.

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:57.672
That's what you are, Lenny.

01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:00.208
You're an un-nice person.

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:04.245
And another thing, your car
smells like a dead fish.

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:09.350
stop the car!

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.325
Touch me,
and you're a dead man.

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:51.526
How was she, Lenny?

01:08:54.662 --> 01:08:58.265
My slaughter at the club
wasn't enough, now you gotta
take my girl too?

01:08:58.568 --> 01:09:03.705
Maybe you wanna drop by
my house later and take
a crap on a picture of my mom?

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:08.877
I mean, if what
you're thinking is what
i think that you're thinking,

01:09:08.879 --> 01:09:10.444
it's not.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:12.881
Were you too rough
with her, Lenny?

01:09:12.883 --> 01:09:15.149
She doesn't like
the rough stuff, does she?

01:09:15.152 --> 01:09:17.551
No, to be honest,
nothing happened.

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:18.620
Come on.

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:21.288
You can tell me.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:25.292
Give me, as they say,
"all the gory details".

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.363
The touch of her hair as you
ran your fingers through it,

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:34.269
the... taste of her skin as you
worked your way down her neck,

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.372
maybe the sweet
smell of victory

01:09:37.374 --> 01:09:40.675
as you rolled those panties
off those soft, milky thighs.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.944
We were just talking, I swear.

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:45.246
Is that what
you threw in the trunk?

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:48.515
I bet you got a whole
panty-museum in there.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:49.584
What?

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:51.219
Open the trunk.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.787
Please, t-bird,
you don't wanna--

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:55.490
Open the trunk!

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:57.792
Or I'll pull the 12-Gauge
in that belly on you

01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.727
faster than you can
squeal like a pig.

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.402
See, you're gonna
learn the hard way

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:10.572
nobody abuses my girl...

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:13.608
Except for me.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.971
<i> ...Boy in jail.</i>

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:18.806
<i> I said,</i>
<i> your money or your life.</i>

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:20.875
<i> You're the funniest</i>
<i>comedian in the world, George.</i>

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.636
Going somewhere?

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.879
How did I get here?

01:11:57.881 --> 01:11:59.981
We towed your drunk ass in.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.583
Every cop in town
is looking for you.

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:03.718
They are?

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:05.420
Why?

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:07.422
Maybe they want your autograph.

01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:11.559
Oh...

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:18.533
Oh, mom.

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:23.037
I don't know whether
you can hear me or not,
but I am in big trouble.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:27.742
It's kinda like the...
Remember that chaplin movie
that we used to watch?

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:32.480
Remember where every time
he got into trouble, everyone
thought it was funnier?

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:35.483
Chaplin was a pervert.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:39.821
What was that, mother?

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:41.556
Chaplin was a pervert.

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:44.625
He stupped every 14-year-old
chippy in Hollywood.

01:12:44.627 --> 01:12:47.562
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought I was alone.

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:50.965
And he knocked up
both of his wives
who weren't even 16.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:53.134
That's statutory,
the last time I checked.

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:56.437
Not to mention,
a crime against god.

01:12:56.439 --> 01:12:57.839
I didn't know that.

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.440
Then read your damn Bible.

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:04.779
Well, get your facts straight
before you go off
talking to people in heaven,

01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:07.782
'cause people in heaven,
they know everything,

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:09.584
specially Jesus.

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:13.888
And he was also
known for having
an incredibly large penis.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:14.956
Jesus?

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:16.691
Chaplin, you idiot!

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:19.994
Are you a real priest?

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:24.966
I used to be,
but the fundamentalists,
they kicked me out.

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:27.101
They wanted me to work solo.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:29.570
So now I take
my mission on the road.

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:33.074
Churches, nightclubs,
and some days, the holy land.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:34.542
Jerusalem?

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:38.946
One of us gets out,
we all get out.
That's the way I see it.

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:40.948
Just like easter Sunday.

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:45.486
Father, would you please
hear my confession?

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:47.922
Sorry. Kitchen's closed.

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:51.959
Perhaps
i can be of some assistance.

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:55.930
Oh, great.
Now you've gone and woke up
Mr. bleeding heart.

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:59.534
What seems to be troubling you?

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:02.036
-Uh...
-Go ahead, Lenny.

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:03.805
I'm here to help.

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:10.745
You see, I do have this friend,
and well, he's been doing
some terrible things,

01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:14.182
and part of him knows
that he needs to stop,
but then...

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:17.185
There's a part of him, well,
that kinda just
doesn't know anymore.

01:14:17.187 --> 01:14:22.056
A wise man once said,
"if your right eye
causes you to sin,

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:23.791
pluck it out."

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.828
Do you understand
what that means, Lenny?

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:28.129
I think so.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:30.198
Good. Then go in peace.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.935
And remember, the great one
is always watching.

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:35.002
God?

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:36.471
Gleeson.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:43.211
Mr.
 Freeman, they just told me you were in here.

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:44.846
Where are we going?

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:46.581
Interrogation room.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.516
What's gonna happen to me,
officer flick?

01:14:48.518 --> 01:14:50.651
Depends on
how it goes in there.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:51.853
Good luck.

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:20.581
All right. What's happened?

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.917
Everything?

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:25.686
Yeah.

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:27.989
Everything.

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.593
You got two minutes.

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.030
Okay.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:38.733
Here goes.

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:43.304
T all started when
i got off the interstate

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:45.907
to get some gas
on my way to las Vegas.

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:49.010
How's it going in there?

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.979
What am I, a lip-reader?

01:15:56.818 --> 01:16:00.288
And then the next thing
i knew, there was blood
everywhere, and...

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:03.057
And I...
I even had to...

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.560
Scoop up a piece of his brain.

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:07.595
I mean, I think
it was his brain.

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:10.565
To be honest, I was never
very good in science.

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:22.176
Funny.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.682
Funny stuff.

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:32.153
You're good, Freeman.

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:34.722
You're very good.

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:39.727
The part about
the severed hand...

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.930
Look at me,
I'm busting a gut.

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:48.202
All right. I'm gonna want to
see your full act tonight.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:50.004
Your best material.

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:52.106
No stops.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:58.946
You stick the landing,
we'll put you on live tomorrow.

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.816
Uh... sorry,
i don't understand.

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:03.351
Comedy.

01:17:03.353 --> 01:17:06.020
It's currency, Freeman.

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:08.689
Monte said if you were
as good as the steward
tells him,

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:12.727
for me to get your ass
to Vegas, pronto.

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:14.895
So you're not
going to arrest me?

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:19.300
Kid, stop, please, before
i start hemorrhaging with
laughter all right?

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:21.636
You look for me
after your set tonight.

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:23.671
I'll have a limo waiting.

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:28.209
This is your chance, kid.

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:30.878
Don't blow it.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:03.277
If you're looking for your car,

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:05.179
your manager picked it up.

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:07.815
My manager?

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:15.122
Be careful out there.

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:16.957
They hit a record high today.

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:41.148
So...

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:44.752
He's gold.

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.320
What did I tell you?

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:48.723
So we're square, right?

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.460
Oh, yeah, right.

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:55.162
All right, there you go.

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:56.864
It's all there.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:03.804
-Yeah, just a little, but
you know, as soon as I get--
-we're done here.

01:19:03.806 --> 01:19:06.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm gonna get the rest to you,
all right? I promise.

01:19:06.476 --> 01:19:08.042
Tonight.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:10.778
You're gonna
get the rest tonight.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.280
This joker nails it...

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:16.050
Everything's forgiven.

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:19.120
But if not...

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.105
Hello, hitch.

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:19.013
Well, well, well,
the prodigal son has returned.

01:20:19.015 --> 01:20:22.149
Fucking ac's busted.
Can you believe it?

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:24.819
Hotter than a fat lady's
armpit in there.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.855
You took my car.

01:20:27.857 --> 01:20:32.226
Well, I didn't think
you wanted all that beef
cooking in the pd parking lot.

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:34.995
You see, that's what
managers do. You know,
we manage things.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:37.832
Things like auditions
for the <i> monte guy show.</i>

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:42.169
I'm sorry, hitch.
I know that I've been
acting selfish, and...

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:44.104
Well, you've been right
all along.

01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:50.377
No, from now, we're gonna
do it your way. Everything.
Whatever you need.

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:54.982
All right. Now I need about
ten more mini-marts.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:57.017
I got a better idea.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:21:00.521
You? You got a better idea?

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:03.157
It's a good one.
Easy money.

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:08.195
Oh, yeah?
How easy?

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.412
How much further?

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:30.484
It better not be another one
of them hindu hamlets.
We gotta start thinking bigger.

01:21:30.486 --> 01:21:32.286
Can you not do that, please?

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:43.898
You know what,
i read about this guy once,

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:47.968
stood outside one of them
drive-through bank machines
wearing a suit.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:49.270
What kind of suit?

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:52.506
It doesn't matter.
A suit-suit.

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:58.646
and that the atm was out
of order and he was there
to run people's cards for 'em.

01:21:58.648 --> 01:22:04.218
So these morons,
they'd hand over their card
and their password,

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:07.421
suit guy would take it inside,
take out 500 big ones,

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:12.960
and come back with the,
you know, measly 40 or 50 clams
that they asked for.

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:15.596
Simple as that.
No one gets hurt.

01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:17.064
Smart.

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:18.565
Yeah, fucking right, smart.

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:25.372
'cause he literally
sweated his ass off!
I'm dying here, man!

01:22:25.374 --> 01:22:27.141
Where the fuck are we?

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.377
We're here.

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:31.545
Here? Here, where?

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:34.081
There ain't nothing here,
Lenny. Come on.

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.083
Our contract.

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:47.561
You're a dead man, Lenny!

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:52.266
Come back here so
i can fucking kill you!

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:00.474
Fuck!

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:16.690
<i> "Dear grail,</i>
<i> I'm sorry about last night.</i>

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:19.059
<i> I haven't been myself lately.</i>

01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:22.196
<i> But today, all that changed.</i>

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:24.331
<i> Today, I have been</i>
<i> given another chance,</i>

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.334
<i> and I know exactly</i>
<i> what I have to do.</i>

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.003
<i> It's like tq says,</i>

01:23:29.005 --> 01:23:31.338
<i> 'the heart knows</i>
<i> what it wants.'</i>

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.140
<i> and right now,</i>
<i> my heart's telling me</i>

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:36.176
<i> that it is not as</i>
<i> important for me to be famous</i>

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:40.481
<i> as it is for you to give me</i>
<i> a second chance...</i>

01:23:40.483 --> 01:23:44.752
<i>Because tonight, I'm going back</i>
<i>to being the old me.</i>

01:23:44.754 --> 01:23:48.655
<i> Please forgive me,</i>

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:51.291
<i> I'll be waiting</i>

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.494
<i> Lenny.</i>

01:23:53.496 --> 01:23:56.764
<i> P.S. You were right.</i>

01:23:56.766 --> 01:23:59.266
<i> I don't think my car's</i>
<i> gonna make it."</i>

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.100
Funny.

01:25:00.863 --> 01:25:04.765
Two minutes go by, I'm still
in the parking lot, high.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:06.500
I still can't move.

01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:15.309
Hey, listen, t-bird didn't
show up. You're gonna
have to go up early.

01:25:15.744 --> 01:25:20.314
mess yourself up,
throw some blood in
your shirt or something?

01:25:20.316 --> 01:25:23.584
No, I'm gonna try
some new material tonight.

01:25:23.586 --> 01:25:24.785
What, are you nuts?

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:26.887
Monte's right-hand man
is out there.

01:25:26.889 --> 01:25:29.323
I know a thing or two
about right hands.

01:25:29.325 --> 01:25:32.359
Look, this is no time to
screw with the formula.

01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:36.463
Nobody wants to see
the Jerry who runs around
talking to crippled kids.

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:40.734
They all want to see the Jerry
who runs around going "buddy!"

01:25:40.736 --> 01:25:42.703
You take my word for it.

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:45.506
You're up.

01:25:45.508 --> 01:25:47.508
You remember
what I'm telling you.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:48.709
"Buddy!"

01:25:48.711 --> 01:25:50.310
You think about it.

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:04.858
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
he's back tonight for
one last appearance.

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:09.463
Please welcome back
to the stage, the king
of carnage himself,

01:26:09.465 --> 01:26:13.500
Lenny Freeman!

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:22.309
<i> This is your chance, kid.</i>

01:26:22.311 --> 01:26:24.611
<i> Now you've finally got</i>
<i>a little inspiration, man.</i>

01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:26.780
<i> I have dreamed</i>
<i> about this my whole life.</i>

01:26:26.782 --> 01:26:30.484
<i> If your right eye</i>
<i> causes you to sin...</i>

01:26:30.486 --> 01:26:32.653
<i> It's in that trunk</i>
<i> any time you need it.</i>

01:26:32.655 --> 01:26:37.424
<i> One of us gets out,</i>
<i> we all get out.</i>

01:26:37.426 --> 01:26:39.426
<i> Back to</i>
<i> being the old me.</i>

01:26:39.428 --> 01:26:40.894
<i> This is your chance, kid.</i>

01:26:40.896 --> 01:26:42.596
<i> Or ten, partner.</i>

01:26:42.598 --> 01:26:44.598
<i> Don't blow it.</i>

01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:48.502
Thank you
thank you very much.

01:26:48.504 --> 01:26:51.772
Wow. Wow, let me take
a look at this crowd.

01:26:51.774 --> 01:26:53.774
Holy cow, look at these faces.

01:26:53.776 --> 01:26:57.511
Well, I haven't seen
happier faces at easter island.

01:26:59.782 --> 01:27:02.349
Uh, hey, how about
lamb bone, huh?

01:27:02.351 --> 01:27:04.318
What a great place.
You know, it's
the kind of place

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.453
you really feel like
you could settle down.

01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:09.690
You know, my father,
when he did did settle,

01:27:09.692 --> 01:27:11.658
he paid off his bar tab.

01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:14.628
Uh...

01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:17.264
The, um...

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:22.803
There's a lot of people that
will tell you that marriage...

01:27:22.805 --> 01:27:25.005
Marriage is
the highway to heaven.

01:27:25.007 --> 01:27:28.375
Well, I guess I am
on the detour.

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:52.699
Uh...

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:57.671
I'll be right back.

01:28:00.742 --> 01:28:01.708
Lenny!

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:02.676
Hey!

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:42.316
What do you want me
to do with this?

01:28:42.318 --> 01:28:45.385
It's that joker's
personal shit he'd forgotten.

01:28:45.387 --> 01:28:47.354
Oh. Just leave it
on my desk.

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:49.489
You are my hero.

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:10.811
Hitch?

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.688
Hitch?

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:22.923
Hello, Lenny.

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:32.466
We've been waiting for you.

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:36.737
How did you
get back so quick?

01:29:36.739 --> 01:29:39.506
Mmm. You forget, Lenny.

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.975
Always another way.

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.412
I had to do a bit of
walking in the heat

01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:47.848
before a sweet young thing
agreed to pick me up,

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:49.116
ain't that right, darling?

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:57.657
Unfortunately, she came
down with a terrible case
of whiplash.

01:29:58.025 --> 01:29:59.526
I can explain.

01:29:59.528 --> 01:30:01.428
Let's explain, Lenny.

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:04.030
You left me for dead
in a 150-degree heat

01:30:04.032 --> 01:30:06.533
with no water,
bend us away.

01:30:07.735 --> 01:30:09.603
Very sporting of you.

01:30:09.605 --> 01:30:12.472
I just wanted to go back
to the way it was.

01:30:12.474 --> 01:30:16.510
Well, too fucking late.

01:30:16.512 --> 01:30:20.714
You can't go back.
You can never go back.

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.683
We have a contract.

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:27.020
Well, I'm breaking
that contract, okay?

01:30:27.022 --> 01:30:29.556
You hear me? I just...

01:30:29.558 --> 01:30:31.958
I don't wanna
be famous anymore.

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.895
Is that so?

01:30:34.897 --> 01:30:37.464
Then why'd you go
peeking in the trunk?

01:30:38.634 --> 01:30:41.501
Why'd you stick
your fat nose in the trunk?

01:30:41.503 --> 01:30:44.571
You just wanted to make sure
everyone was comfortable?

01:30:44.573 --> 01:30:46.840
Or were you
looking for a little...

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:49.443
Inspiration?

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.111
No.

01:30:51.113 --> 01:30:53.513
No, I... you...

01:30:53.515 --> 01:30:55.715
Just stop it.
You're trying to confuse me.

01:30:55.717 --> 01:31:00.020
That's it, hitch.
If you want me to stop,
you're gonna have to kill me,

01:31:00.022 --> 01:31:02.823
because I just
don't care anymore.

01:31:02.825 --> 01:31:06.760
Okay, okay, okay,
you know what, Lenny?
You win.

01:31:06.762 --> 01:31:09.863
Guess I know
when I've been beat.

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:18.872
But, before you go...

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:23.477
There's a little something
i wanna show you.

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.216
Came by earlier,
looking for you.

01:31:29.218 --> 01:31:31.017
I told her,
make herself comfortable.

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:34.087
Now I suggest that
you do the same.

01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:37.090
No, no. This has nothing
to do with her.

01:31:37.092 --> 01:31:38.792
Oh, but you're wrong, Lenny.

01:31:38.794 --> 01:31:41.495
This has everything
to do with her.

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:48.869
Sit.

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:18.131
Ever hear of a guy
named fatty arbuckle?

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:23.136
I thought you was
a comedy expert.

01:32:23.138 --> 01:32:27.541
Well, fatty was
a big time joker
much like yourself,

01:32:27.543 --> 01:32:29.276
except he worked in
the silent pictures,

01:32:29.278 --> 01:32:32.312
had a big studio deal in
the early 1900s.

01:32:32.314 --> 01:32:34.648
Women loved him,
kids loved him.

01:32:34.650 --> 01:32:38.051
He had everything
fame had to offer.

01:32:38.854 --> 01:32:45.292
during a three-day moonshine
free-for-all at a day city
hotel up in San Francisco,

01:32:45.294 --> 01:32:52.232
he takes this pretty young
flapping thing behind closed
doors and, how do you say...

01:32:52.234 --> 01:32:56.169
Does her with
a champagne bottle.

01:32:56.171 --> 01:32:58.838
At least that's what
the coroner report
said it was.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.241
Of course, no one knows
for sure 'cause the poor girl
bled to death

01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:05.178
and everyone else was too drunk
to see straight, let alone
hear the screaming...

01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:11.585
Over and over.

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:13.987
Screaming for help.

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:16.289
So what happens, you ask?

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:20.860
Well, the courts,
in their infinite wisdom,

01:33:20.862 --> 01:33:23.797
chose to clear fatty
of all charges.

01:33:23.799 --> 01:33:27.000
Sent him home,
an innocent man.

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:29.703
But the people...

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:32.305
Well, the people knew.

01:33:32.307 --> 01:33:37.277
And as much as fatty
tried to get back
into their good graces,

01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:39.679
there just was no going back.

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:43.350
His career was dead,

01:33:43.352 --> 01:33:46.786
his life, essentially over.

01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:54.160
All because of one
teensy-weensy fatal
little decision.

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.897
So you see, Lenny...

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:02.068
We can regret our choices
all we want,

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:06.906
but someone's still gotta
pay the consequences.

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:10.043
Champagne, anyone?

01:34:10.045 --> 01:34:12.979
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:16.082
Riding cowboy,
right, Lenny?

01:34:16.084 --> 01:34:17.851
Please. Please. I'll do
whatever you say.

01:34:17.853 --> 01:34:20.253
Oh, you're gonna do
whatever I say,
'cause from now on,

01:34:20.255 --> 01:34:24.691
you'll understand exactly
what I mean by consequences.

01:34:24.693 --> 01:34:26.893
-Hitch.
-Nothing personal,
cream cheese.

01:34:26.895 --> 01:34:29.329
-Please.
-Here's to commitment.

01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:07.000

01:35:29.991 --> 01:35:31.791
We could be together now, okay?

01:35:31.793 --> 01:35:35.228
Listen, we could go away
like we talked about, okay?

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:39.065
And... and you could
deal Blackjack, and um, well,
i could be in monte guy.

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:42.368
We're gonna be so happy,
grail, because...

01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:44.804
Because I love you so much.

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:49.743
You're supposed to love me too.

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:01.121
I do love you, Lenny.

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:07.994
You do?

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:26.946
I brought someone
to see you, Lenny.

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:31.117
Funny stuff, kid.

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:34.087
You're gonna wanna
stick with the sick stuff
for monte though,

01:36:34.089 --> 01:36:37.557
'cause that performance
art shit goes
right over his head.

01:36:37.559 --> 01:36:40.160
So I'm still going to Vegas?

01:36:40.162 --> 01:36:42.328
As soon as you get
your ass in the car.

01:37:23.438 --> 01:37:28.541
<i> And now,</i>
<i> please give a warm</i>
<i> las Vegas welcome</i>

01:37:28.543 --> 01:37:31.578

01:37:37.084 --> 01:37:38.618
Oh, thank you.

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:42.055
We serve that
with a heart attack.

01:37:42.057 --> 01:37:44.424
Would you like it for here,
or to go?

01:37:46.494 --> 01:37:49.429
Lenny Freeman,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:49.431 --> 01:37:52.198

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:52.999
Yes, I did.

01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:54.334
Let's bring her out.

01:37:55.337 --> 01:37:56.402
Oh!

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.874
My father's idea of settling

01:38:00.876 --> 01:38:02.508
was paying off his bar tab.

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:08.615
