WEBVTT

00:08.045 --> 00:09.780
Eight million and counting.

00:09.814 --> 00:12.742
Not bad for a game that hit online stores

00:12.753 --> 00:14.423
less than an hour ago.

00:14.454 --> 00:15.662
Enjoy the show, guys.

00:15.662 --> 00:18.246
This is what four years
of hard work looks like.

00:18.366 --> 00:21.072
If Ogre Fury doesn't sell 100
million units by breakfast,

00:21.092 --> 00:22.425
I'll eat my keyboard.

00:23.025 --> 00:26.229
8.5. Where's Duncan? He
should be seeing this.

00:26.264 --> 00:28.398
He's chained to his desk, where else?

00:28.432 --> 00:30.169
Though I can't imagine
what's more important

00:30.190 --> 00:31.492
than his own game release party.

00:31.524 --> 00:33.835
Dun-can. Dun-can!

00:33.866 --> 00:36.745
Dun-can! Dun-can! Dun-can!

00:36.865 --> 00:39.339
Ok, ok. You win. But,

00:39.360 --> 00:41.913
if he gets pissed and wants
to know whose idea this was,

00:41.945 --> 00:44.513
I'm throwing you all under the bus.

00:48.445 --> 00:50.251
I'm just going to get him.

00:52.016 --> 00:54.523
Duncan, are you busy?

00:55.890 --> 00:57.335
Come on, Duncan.

00:57.377 --> 00:58.285
Join the party.

00:58.310 --> 01:01.099
It's not gonna kill you to
have a drink with the coworkers.

01:02.797 --> 01:03.939
Duncan?

01:08.544 --> 01:10.897
Duncan!

01:11.326 --> 01:14.442
Get help! Somebody call 911.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.426
For the win.

01:19.745 --> 01:21.661
- Nice.
- Oh! There it is.

01:21.712 --> 01:23.402
That's how you darts, my friend.

01:23.435 --> 01:25.612
Hey Doug, why don't you put
that up on the big board.

01:25.645 --> 01:27.199
- Good for another one?
- I'm good, I'm good.

01:27.319 --> 01:28.519
You've been kicking my ass all day.

01:28.544 --> 01:30.233
Alright, well the clinic
stays open for another hour.

01:30.266 --> 01:32.871
- So, I'd advise you to take some notes.
- Oz, Oz.

01:32.879 --> 01:34.543
This blonde girl here,

01:34.663 --> 01:37.225
- she's been checking you out.
- What, that one?

01:37.345 --> 01:38.763
- Yeah.
- How do you know?

01:38.813 --> 01:40.602
- She's just sitting and smiling.
- She's not being subtle.

01:40.602 --> 01:42.375
Yeah, she's smiling at you.

01:42.922 --> 01:44.754
I guess. Huh.

01:45.048 --> 01:47.674
How do I not pick this
stuff up? My game is just...

01:47.709 --> 01:50.005
I'm, I'm clueless.

01:50.366 --> 01:52.382
There's your opening. Go, get in there.

01:52.407 --> 01:54.635
- Go, go, go!
- Ok, ok. Alright.

01:54.755 --> 01:57.181
- Hey, should I bring a...
- Don't... don't bring a dart. Just go.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.668
Why would you bring a dart?

02:00.895 --> 02:02.777
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:02.987 --> 02:04.995
- How you doing?
- Good, thank you.

02:05.029 --> 02:06.550
Oh good, good.

02:06.575 --> 02:08.508
You know you've got the most amazing eyes.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.424
You're sweet, thank you.

02:10.457 --> 02:11.793
Is that your natural eye colour?

02:11.810 --> 02:13.508
- Or is it like,
- Um, uh huh.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.651
colour contacts? Is that, like, do people...
is that a secret when you have those?

02:16.771 --> 02:19.584
I can never tell, you know?
Oh my God. Jeez, I'm so sorry.

02:19.626 --> 02:22.098
Here, get your purse. Look,
I got it on your dress.

02:22.131 --> 02:23.610
You want me to just...
No, that's inappropriate.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.829
You can go to the washroom
and clean that right off.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.174
We have really good dryers.

02:27.468 --> 02:29.561
And then maybe afterwards
I could get your number?

02:29.594 --> 02:31.225
Are you kidding me?

02:38.149 --> 02:40.771
- A little rusty.
- Yeah, I'm a little rusty.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.542
That was... that was humiliating.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.930
Can't show my face around this
place again, I have no mojo.

02:44.964 --> 02:47.714
- How do you do that?
- I don't know how I got into this.

02:48.687 --> 02:50.068
Dev, what's up?

02:50.103 --> 02:51.846
Friend of mine was just
found shot to death.

02:51.966 --> 02:53.157
He runs a gaming company.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.594
They found his body in his
office less than an hour ago.

02:56.081 --> 02:58.670
- I gotta get down there.
- Hey, Dev. I know he's your friend but,

02:58.695 --> 03:00.410
we can't crash a crime scene.

03:00.426 --> 03:02.595
- We've gotta call Becker first.
- Call him on the way.

03:02.637 --> 03:04.258
You coming or not?

03:04.930 --> 03:06.569
Yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:23.594 --> 03:25.599
Can you give us a minute, please?

03:25.616 --> 03:26.793
Thank you.

03:30.615 --> 03:33.168
Who would do this to
Duncan? He's a game designer.

03:33.203 --> 03:36.939
Said he was shot twice, close range.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.750
No exit wounds.

03:40.598 --> 03:42.338
There's no shell casings.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.044
Totally cleaned up after themselves.

03:44.078 --> 03:46.843
No signs of a struggle,
so whoever did this,

03:47.120 --> 03:48.725
they either got a jump on him or...

03:48.750 --> 03:49.977
Or was someone he knew.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.061
You guys were close, huh?

03:52.498 --> 03:54.322
We used to be.

03:54.390 --> 03:57.590
- What happened?
- I became a cop.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.295
Duncan stayed in the hacker lifestyle.

04:00.321 --> 04:02.178
We lost touch.

04:03.465 --> 04:06.295
A few years ago, he cleaned up his act,

04:07.631 --> 04:09.613
started designing games.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.109
I've been following his career ever since.

04:14.277 --> 04:16.244
He's a good guy.

04:16.310 --> 04:17.940
Sorry it took me so long,

04:17.974 --> 04:19.731
Adam got home as quick as he could.

04:19.764 --> 04:21.151
- You ok?
- Yeah.

04:21.192 --> 04:23.479
Nothing a little caffeine won't fix.

04:24.126 --> 04:25.950
Dev, you alright?

04:26.070 --> 04:28.832
Yeah, still shell-shocked.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.857
I'll be ok.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.069
Yeah, I'll bring you up to speed.

04:50.071 --> 04:52.281
It's alright, Becker called
to brief me on the way over.

04:52.314 --> 04:53.676
How'd you get him on board so quickly?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.399
Dev did the talking. You know
he can be very persuasive.

04:56.424 --> 04:57.970
- That's true.
- He certainly was,

04:58.163 --> 05:01.247
if by persuasive you mean they
refuse to take no for an answer.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.684
- Do we have any suspects?
- No, not yet.

05:03.735 --> 05:06.391
Well, there was a security
camera in the lobby on the way in.

05:06.399 --> 05:07.500
We should check out that footage.

05:07.542 --> 05:08.297
Dev's all over that.

05:08.314 --> 05:10.675
There's also a service door
at the back of the building

05:10.701 --> 05:12.986
that was left open for caterers
and other party traffic.

05:12.986 --> 05:14.715
Unfortunately there was no camera there.

05:14.751 --> 05:17.961
So there's no way to tell if our
killer came in that way. Great.

05:18.339 --> 05:19.616
Who found the body?

05:20.364 --> 05:23.314
Vanessa Reinhold. She's the lead designer.

05:23.356 --> 05:24.969
Number two in the pecking order.

05:24.986 --> 05:27.709
She discovered the victim in
his office shortly after 3pm.

05:27.742 --> 05:31.423
Nobody else was seen entering or
leaving the office previous to that.

05:31.543 --> 05:32.516
Let's go talk to her.

05:32.524 --> 05:34.188
Well, I already have actually.

05:36.406 --> 05:38.221
Right.

05:38.540 --> 05:39.471
That.

05:40.363 --> 05:41.733
She's all yours.

05:42.389 --> 05:43.708
Will we be able to leave soon?

05:43.741 --> 05:45.221
It's been kind of a tough day.

05:45.237 --> 05:47.999
I understand. We just have a
couple of questions for you.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.934
Of course. Anything you need.

05:50.002 --> 05:52.436
When was the last time
that you saw Duncan alive?

05:52.657 --> 05:54.843
The day before yesterday, I think.

05:54.868 --> 05:55.775
Really?

05:55.895 --> 05:57.658
He was in his office prior to the party,

05:57.675 --> 06:00.624
- you didn't see him then?
- I arrived this morning and...

06:01.079 --> 06:03.179
heard music in his office
so, I knew he was there

06:03.196 --> 06:04.591
but I didn't see him.

06:05.288 --> 06:06.524
Not until...

06:06.818 --> 06:09.286
- Who else was here at that time?
- Nobody.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.288
I arrived early to prepare for the party.

06:11.322 --> 06:14.330
And you didn't... Pop
your head in to say hello?

06:14.355 --> 06:16.271
Duncan prefers solitude. We...

06:16.313 --> 06:18.035
try not to bother him
when his door is closed.

06:18.155 --> 06:20.917
Not if we value our jobs.

06:21.037 --> 06:22.900
What do the employees think of him?

06:22.917 --> 06:23.741
Did they like him?

06:23.766 --> 06:26.741
He could be demanding some
days, and dismissive, others.

06:26.783 --> 06:27.917
Rubbed some people the wrong way.

06:27.939 --> 06:29.144
They didn't know where they stood with him.

06:29.178 --> 06:31.220
Anyone in particular?

06:32.276 --> 06:34.010
I know these people.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.254
They're game programmers, not killers.

06:36.279 --> 06:37.867
No matter how much of
a jerk Duncan could be.

06:37.901 --> 06:39.842
What about outside the office?

06:39.962 --> 06:41.858
Did he have any enemies?

06:41.978 --> 06:43.505
Not that I'm aware of.

06:43.625 --> 06:44.682
You sure?

06:44.715 --> 06:47.614
- There's no one you can think of?
- No.

06:48.219 --> 06:50.185
These demands are bleeding me dry.

06:50.227 --> 06:52.942
Not my problem, Eddie. Finish
the contract, or I'll ruin you.

06:52.967 --> 06:55.026
Try it. That would be a mistake.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.801
You didn't see anyone arguing with him?

06:58.868 --> 07:01.639
- It was heated, threats were made?
- No.

07:02.286 --> 07:04.216
These are good people.

07:04.336 --> 07:05.874
Sorry I can't be of more help.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.790
We know that Duncan wasn't married,

07:08.790 --> 07:10.849
but do you know if he
was in a relationship?

07:11.387 --> 07:13.135
Yeah, there was definitely someone.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.312
I mean, he wouldn't admit it, but

07:15.685 --> 07:17.648
I have a sixth sense for these things.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.278
Do you have a name or description?

07:19.320 --> 07:20.875
Duncan was a private person.

07:20.995 --> 07:23.236
He was good at keeping secrets.

07:25.605 --> 07:26.928
Thank you for your time.

07:34.311 --> 07:35.681
Hey, how's it going here?

07:35.715 --> 07:38.405
I've seen what I need to.
Forensics can handle the rest.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.889
Ok, well we still haven't
been able to determine

07:40.892 --> 07:43.606
whether Duncan was killed
during or prior to the party.

07:43.648 --> 07:46.102
An autopsy report'll give
us a clearer picture of that.

07:46.222 --> 07:47.782
- You get anything useful?
- Yeah.

07:47.816 --> 07:50.918
I saw a heated argument
with some guy named Eddie.

07:50.953 --> 07:52.766
Do we know anything about this guy, Eddie?

07:52.808 --> 07:55.161
It kinda looked like they
were in a contract dispute.

07:55.190 --> 07:57.105
Eddie wanted out and Duncan threatened

07:57.128 --> 07:59.259
to ruin him if he didn't
honour the contract.

07:59.327 --> 08:01.461
Smaller game companies like
this can't handle everything

08:01.463 --> 08:03.444
in house so a lot of work is contracted out

08:03.447 --> 08:04.632
to specialty shops.

08:04.657 --> 08:06.430
Well if we go through Duncan's records

08:06.455 --> 08:09.018
and flag any recent
work for hire contracts,

08:09.036 --> 08:11.245
- maybe we'll find this Eddie.
- I'm on that.

08:11.706 --> 08:14.508
Chasing a lead with old
fashioned police work.

08:14.757 --> 08:17.102
You guys are spoiling me.

08:23.942 --> 08:26.379
Hey, goodnight, kids.

08:26.499 --> 08:29.623
Oh please, go ahead. Goodnight, ladies.

08:31.782 --> 08:34.386
Alright girls, we're gonna...
have to call it a night here.

08:34.421 --> 08:35.928
Can we have one more drink?

08:35.962 --> 08:38.505
Pretty please? I'll leave a big tip.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.413
Ha! Ha! Wow.

08:40.421 --> 08:42.556
That's a very generous offer but,

08:42.676 --> 08:45.682
we are over an hour past last call so,

08:45.724 --> 08:47.531
I would lose my license.

08:48.438 --> 08:50.924
- Party pooper.
- Wow, ok.

08:50.942 --> 08:53.464
Well jeez, I've definitely been
called worse things than that.

08:53.498 --> 08:55.355
So I'm not gonna take it personally.

08:55.475 --> 08:58.331
- Thanks...
- And you know, ah, if you like,

08:58.338 --> 09:01.372
I could buy you a drink
another night at another bar?

09:01.492 --> 09:02.742
You're asking me out?

09:02.742 --> 09:03.960
How old are you?

09:03.977 --> 09:06.590
- You could be dating my mother.
- There's no need to be nasty.

09:06.625 --> 09:09.561
Ah um, do you by any chance
have a picture of your mother?

09:09.595 --> 09:11.563
I wouldn't want to rule out any prospects.

09:11.597 --> 09:13.297
Pff.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.961
So we'll just put a pin in that, then?

09:17.247 --> 09:19.844
You... maybe until next time.

09:20.524 --> 09:24.398
Come back. Come back, anytime.

09:28.003 --> 09:29.448
Ok...

09:31.383 --> 09:34.751
So why would Duncan be keeping
his relationship a secret?

09:34.786 --> 09:37.088
Maybe he's trying to avoid
office gossip or maybe

09:37.122 --> 09:39.856
Vanessa read the signs wrong
and he didn't have a girlfriend.

09:39.891 --> 09:42.126
There was nothing in his cellphone records

09:42.160 --> 09:44.161
or contact lists that indicate

09:44.196 --> 09:46.440
any phantom lady friend.

09:46.659 --> 09:48.675
Tell me we have a solid lead.

09:48.869 --> 09:51.282
All of the employee
statements have checked out.

09:51.289 --> 09:54.304
- None of them owns a gun.
- Ok.

09:54.339 --> 09:56.995
What about under the
surface? You get anything?

09:57.020 --> 09:59.155
Well, yeah. Most of his team disliked him,

09:59.172 --> 10:01.584
some more than others. But there
was a begrudging respect there.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.348
I didn't see any of them pull the trigger.

10:03.399 --> 10:05.508
That doesn't mean they couldn't
have pulled the trigger, right?

10:05.516 --> 10:07.718
It just means that you weren't
able to see it right then.

10:07.743 --> 10:08.895
That's true.

10:09.189 --> 10:11.467
- What's that you got?
- This is Ogre Fury.

10:11.475 --> 10:13.231
This is the game that Duncan was working on

10:13.239 --> 10:15.920
for the past 4 years. Dev
said we should check this out.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.071
No, thanks.

10:17.105 --> 10:19.147
- I don't do video games.
- Well, you should.

10:19.180 --> 10:20.970
It's scientifically proven
to keep the mind sharp.

10:20.978 --> 10:22.718
It helps maintain hand-eye coordination.

10:22.718 --> 10:24.213
That's what the gun range is for.

10:24.238 --> 10:25.877
Hey, d'ya find our guy?

10:28.438 --> 10:31.007
- That's him.
- That's Edward Duffy.

10:31.041 --> 10:33.372
He owns the motion capture
studio that was contracted

10:33.405 --> 10:35.338
to do the CG animation for Duncan's game.

10:35.378 --> 10:37.136
Just pretend I'm not a game nerd.

10:37.162 --> 10:40.556
Motion Capture. When the
performance of a live actor

10:40.573 --> 10:43.766
is recorded and then it's reskinned
as a character from the game.

10:43.886 --> 10:46.187
Basically, it makes everything more real.

10:46.221 --> 10:48.347
It's like you're playing a movie.

10:48.364 --> 10:50.027
God, I miss Pacman.

10:50.147 --> 10:51.564
Duffy's business is tanking,

10:51.581 --> 10:53.985
fulfilling the contract was
costing more than he was making.

10:54.105 --> 10:56.766
So, the longer the job went on,
the deeper he went in the hole.

10:56.799 --> 10:58.094
That's why they were arguing.

10:58.136 --> 11:01.153
See, Eddie wanted out of the
contract before he went broke.

11:01.590 --> 11:04.967
- Duncan wouldn't budge.
- Yeah, but once the game was released,

11:05.007 --> 11:05.925
wouldn't he make his money back?

11:05.942 --> 11:07.539
Subcontractors work for a set fee,

11:07.547 --> 11:09.329
they're not in line to make
a penny from the profit.

11:09.354 --> 11:13.371
- Sounds like motive. Nice work.
- Thanks, but that's not all.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.438
I looked at the rest of the contracts

11:15.463 --> 11:17.959
and I found another deal that
seemed even more predatory.

11:17.986 --> 11:19.724
Dynamic Solutions.

11:19.758 --> 11:20.808
What do these guys do?

11:21.001 --> 11:22.850
They write dynamic libraries...

11:22.883 --> 11:25.783
stock elements that are the
building blocks for most games.

11:25.816 --> 11:27.825
Duncan bought Dynamic's code for a steal,

11:27.859 --> 11:31.345
much less than it's valued, which is
unusual in such a competitive market.

11:31.465 --> 11:33.716
Who was Duncan dealing with over there?

11:36.447 --> 11:38.138
Simon Fields.

11:38.173 --> 11:40.808
Alright. Let's divide and conquer.

11:40.842 --> 11:43.497
McCluskey, you and Logan
go talk to Edward Duffy.

11:43.548 --> 11:45.144
See what his thoughts on revenge are.

11:45.264 --> 11:46.615
Grab your coat.

11:46.735 --> 11:49.082
We're off to talk to a man about some code.

12:00.127 --> 12:02.009
You'd better take a lead on this one.

12:02.129 --> 12:04.447
I haven't exactly brushed
up on my geek-speak.

12:04.865 --> 12:07.279
- Simon Fields.
- Uh, yeah?

12:07.399 --> 12:10.388
IIB. We'd like to speak
with you about Duncan Quinn.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.505
Yeah, of course. Come on in.

12:16.976 --> 12:18.944
I was sorry to hear about Duncan.

12:18.978 --> 12:20.977
Tell me about Dynamic Solutions.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.321
Well, we're based in the UK

12:23.347 --> 12:26.452
and we operate a number of code farms
throughout India and Eastern Europe.

12:26.486 --> 12:28.884
- "Code farms"?
- Coding's labour intensive.

12:28.918 --> 12:31.271
Production's a lot
cheaper in those countries.

12:31.391 --> 12:34.321
This is actually our first push
into the North American games market.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.883
We know that Tough Critter bought
your dynamic code library for a song.

12:38.003 --> 12:40.331
How do you survive with
such small profit margins?

12:40.366 --> 12:42.059
Well we did our research.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.797
I mean, we knew that Duncan's
game had a great buzz behind it

12:44.799 --> 12:46.421
and now that it's a massive hit,

12:46.471 --> 12:48.589
we have the cachet to charge a premium.

12:48.891 --> 12:50.375
Everybody wins.

12:52.698 --> 12:53.824
Well,

12:54.244 --> 12:55.782
almost everyone.

12:56.286 --> 12:58.115
D'you get along with Duncan Quinn?

12:58.150 --> 13:00.328
I mean, I only met him
a few times in person.

13:00.448 --> 13:02.353
He was definitely a tough negotiator.

13:02.386 --> 13:04.092
He drove down the price of the library

13:04.092 --> 13:06.831
more than we were comfortable
with. But, paid off.

13:06.858 --> 13:09.293
- When did you last speak with him?
- A few days ago.

13:09.327 --> 13:12.495
I called him to congratulate
him on the impending game launch.

13:12.688 --> 13:16.033
He told me that our codes
were "perfectly adequate."

13:16.596 --> 13:20.327
Hey, for Duncan, that was very high praise.

13:27.445 --> 13:29.563
You know, I think
Becker's warming up to you.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.244
I'm not sure that Becker does warm.

13:31.364 --> 13:32.858
Give it time.

13:33.387 --> 13:37.387
WHO DARES ENTER MY LAIR?

13:45.978 --> 13:48.314
Pathetic humans.

13:48.382 --> 13:52.776
State your business or be gone with you.

13:52.801 --> 13:55.465
We're with the IIB. Open the door.

13:55.474 --> 13:58.356
- You have ID?
- Do I have ID?

13:58.392 --> 14:00.230
Yeah. I have ID.

14:00.650 --> 14:03.264
To the camera, please.

14:06.499 --> 14:08.322
Thank you.

14:08.442 --> 14:12.505
- Is that freaky enough for you?
- Yep.

14:26.452 --> 14:29.594
Games have come a long way
since my first Nintendo.

14:31.728 --> 14:34.031
Alright everyone, take a break.

14:34.057 --> 14:35.427
We'll pick it up again in a bit.

14:38.805 --> 14:40.721
Doesn't look like much, does it?

14:40.841 --> 14:43.175
But, once we've finished
layering in the effects,

14:43.192 --> 14:45.251
they will the most fearsome
knights in the realm.

14:45.285 --> 14:49.274
- You must be Edward Duffy.
- That I am, pathetic human.

14:50.142 --> 14:52.604
Ha! I'm sorry, I can't help myself.

14:52.724 --> 14:54.923
And it does scare away the bill collectors.

14:54.932 --> 14:56.730
Is that an ongoing concern that you have?

14:56.755 --> 14:59.007
Sadly, yes. We,

14:59.041 --> 15:01.159
got slammed pretty hard by a recent job.

15:01.209 --> 15:03.202
You referring to the
Tough Critter contract?

15:03.218 --> 15:05.487
I guess you've asked around.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.941
So, this is about Duncan's murder.

15:08.966 --> 15:12.949
It's all good. Just routine.
Not here to make an arrest.

15:13.069 --> 15:15.924
We know that you and Duncan
Quinn had a rocky relationship.

15:16.044 --> 15:19.044
Duncan squeezed me for
all he could and then

15:19.050 --> 15:21.949
when I didn't have the operating
cash to finish the work he...

15:22.260 --> 15:24.949
gave the project to a
rival studio to finish.

15:25.069 --> 15:27.495
- The ultimate insult.
- Complete betrayal.

15:27.747 --> 15:30.890
If it weren't for some
last minute feature work,

15:30.923 --> 15:33.175
I'd have shuttered the doors already.

15:33.295 --> 15:35.435
Must have made you very angry.

15:35.486 --> 15:37.351
Are you asking if I killed him?

15:37.401 --> 15:40.824
Ahh!

15:43.284 --> 15:45.928
Ha! Ha! I assure you, I did not.

15:45.963 --> 15:47.915
Violence!

15:55.539 --> 15:57.847
Is best left to the imagination.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.755
Do you own a gun?

16:00.875 --> 16:03.226
I am more of a two-handed
broadsword type of fellow.

16:03.346 --> 16:05.587
You know if Duncan had a girlfriend?

16:13.957 --> 16:15.839
Not that I know of.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.926
But I wasn't really up on his social life.

16:19.025 --> 16:21.211
Ok. Well, thank you for your time.

16:21.331 --> 16:23.749
- Pretty cool.
- Yes.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.405
I got Duncan cozying up next to a woman.

16:29.438 --> 16:31.371
He was pretty nervous that we were here,

16:31.380 --> 16:34.050
I did see him kill Duncan,
but, with a video game Ogre.

16:34.053 --> 16:36.069
So, does that mean he actually did it?

16:55.163 --> 16:57.698
Come on, mojo.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.300
You've gotta be in there somewhere.

17:00.566 --> 17:02.012
Excuse me?

17:02.054 --> 17:04.096
I know you came in with
that gentleman over there.

17:04.137 --> 17:06.701
But rest assured, you'll
be leaving with me.

17:06.751 --> 17:09.045
You. Me. Dinner. Dancing.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.845
Breakfast. What happens in between?

17:10.861 --> 17:13.877
Well... depends how you
play your cards, sugar lips.

17:13.998 --> 17:15.576
That's right, I called you sugar li...

17:22.324 --> 17:24.585
Who are you kidding?

17:27.194 --> 17:29.735
- This is for you.
- Oh, ok. Just put it there,

17:29.763 --> 17:31.711
I'll, uh, get to it next.

17:31.831 --> 17:33.492
What am I testing it for?

17:34.442 --> 17:37.618
Um, deliciousness?

17:39.282 --> 17:42.367
Oh! Sorry.

17:42.487 --> 17:43.980
That was really sweet of you.

17:44.014 --> 17:47.459
I could definitely use a jolt right now.

17:48.551 --> 17:50.576
Mmm. Moka shot.

17:51.013 --> 17:53.693
- Damn, you're good.
- Well, I try.

17:54.340 --> 17:58.643
Uh, I have your autopsy
report for your friend back.

17:58.763 --> 18:01.239
Just came in a few minutes ago.

18:01.533 --> 18:02.659
Here we go.

18:02.659 --> 18:05.886
They pulled two .45 slugs from his chest.

18:05.911 --> 18:08.113
They're in decent shape so,
we should be able to match it

18:08.155 --> 18:10.197
with the murder weapon if it's found.

18:10.592 --> 18:12.483
What about toxicology?

18:14.617 --> 18:16.516
No alcohol, no drugs.

18:16.542 --> 18:20.542
Unless you count the gallon of energy
drink they found in his stomach.

18:20.662 --> 18:23.340
Time of death around 5am.

18:25.231 --> 18:26.970
Are you sure that's accurate?

18:26.995 --> 18:28.734
Liver temperature never lies.

18:29.886 --> 18:31.272
Right.

18:31.970 --> 18:33.357
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

18:33.477 --> 18:36.433
- Enjoy the coffee.
- Thank you.

18:38.930 --> 18:40.441
Hey, Dev.

18:40.751 --> 18:42.289
You find our girl yet?

18:44.735 --> 18:46.771
You tell me.

18:47.121 --> 18:49.482
I've got a list of all the female mo-cap

18:49.507 --> 18:50.902
performance artists that worked for Duffy

18:50.942 --> 18:52.583
in the last six months and I

18:52.625 --> 18:55.179
took their headshots from
various agency websites.

18:55.299 --> 18:57.490
So, say when.

18:59.675 --> 19:01.423
How you doing with all this?

19:01.456 --> 19:02.944
I'm ok.

19:04.330 --> 19:06.464
You know what's really bothering me though?

19:06.584 --> 19:09.363
He was killed 10 hours before
his body was discovered.

19:09.483 --> 19:12.910
In his office. Surrounded
by coworkers. No one noticed?

19:13.246 --> 19:14.371
From what I saw,

19:14.405 --> 19:16.800
he was the kind of guy who
didn't have much time for people.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.212
The Duncan I knew respected
and trusted his friends.

19:19.332 --> 19:20.463
People change.

19:20.472 --> 19:23.430
Especially when money
and power are involved.

19:24.241 --> 19:26.176
Maybe.

19:26.243 --> 19:28.411
There had to be someone else
who saw that side of him, too.

19:30.047 --> 19:31.883
There she is.

19:32.656 --> 19:34.219
Mary Woodley.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.019
Maybe we just found someone
who knew the real Duncan.

19:44.866 --> 19:47.596
I can't believe this is happening.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.164
How well did you know Duncan?

19:49.232 --> 19:52.446
We saw each other around the
mo-cap studio all the time.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.782
- We're friends.
- Were you guys more than friends?

20:00.977 --> 20:03.145
We enjoyed each other's company.

20:03.213 --> 20:05.598
Are you saying you weren't
romantically involved?

20:07.614 --> 20:09.984
It wasn't a serious relationship.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.605
It was complicated.

20:11.631 --> 20:14.598
We're gonna find out eventually,
it's better if we hear it from you.

20:16.354 --> 20:19.527
Well, like I said, we saw
each other around the studio.

20:19.595 --> 20:23.816
His passion for the
work caught my attention.

20:24.202 --> 20:27.404
But, seeing him was a mistake.

20:27.429 --> 20:29.832
- I, I ended it.
- Why, what happened?

20:31.850 --> 20:33.774
How could you do this to me?

20:33.791 --> 20:35.379
I'm so sorry, it was a mistake.

20:35.951 --> 20:37.699
Was there someone else?

20:37.985 --> 20:40.540
Is that why you guys
were being so secretive?

20:41.215 --> 20:43.246
My boyfriend, Carl.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.204
We've lived together for two years.

20:46.237 --> 20:48.910
I love him, but I was confused.

20:50.439 --> 20:53.727
A few nights ago, he
found out about Duncan.

20:55.666 --> 20:57.683
It's over, I swear.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.523
He left angry.

21:02.531 --> 21:05.228
He hasn't been home since.
I don't know where he is.

21:05.270 --> 21:07.741
You think he's capable of hurting Duncan?

21:07.861 --> 21:09.480
No.

21:09.850 --> 21:11.531
I don't know.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.733
He was so angry.

21:15.657 --> 21:20.245
My fault. Destroyed two lives.

21:21.455 --> 21:23.715
You saw him leave with the gun?

21:23.835 --> 21:25.993
- Yeah.
- Michelle?

21:26.026 --> 21:26.942
- Yeah?
- This just came in.

21:26.950 --> 21:28.404
Thanks.

21:29.934 --> 21:32.640
Ok. So, there's a Smith & Wesson

21:32.648 --> 21:35.278
registered to Carl Ronson
at the same address.

21:35.302 --> 21:37.304
.45 calibre. Same as the murder weapon.

21:37.424 --> 21:40.656
And you say that she has no
idea where Carl may be holed up?

21:40.690 --> 21:42.589
She was worried about him.
If she was thinking about him,

21:42.597 --> 21:44.791
if she knew where he
was, I would have seen it.

21:44.816 --> 21:46.992
Well there was no hotel
charges on his credit card

21:47.017 --> 21:49.227
so, maybe he's staying
with friends or family.

21:49.269 --> 21:51.202
- I'll put together a list.
- Fine.

21:51.219 --> 21:52.790
I'll get an APB out immediately.

21:52.832 --> 21:55.033
I have Carl Ronson's cellphone records.

21:55.050 --> 21:57.420
He hasn't made or received
a call in the last 24 hours.

21:57.462 --> 21:59.344
- Maybe he turned it off.
- Or he dumped it.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.713
Probably figured we could track his signal.

22:00.739 --> 22:02.697
I recognize one number from the call log.

22:02.705 --> 22:04.873
One of the last calls he
made was to Edward Duffy.

22:04.898 --> 22:06.318
The guy who owns the mo-cap studio

22:06.319 --> 22:07.638
that Duncan almost ran into the ground.

22:07.671 --> 22:10.008
Makes sense that they would
know each other through Mary.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.865
They both had strong motive.

22:11.899 --> 22:13.059
Maybe they conspired.

22:13.076 --> 22:14.924
Think we're heading back
to the ogre's lair, right?

22:15.134 --> 22:17.412
Bring your broadswords.

22:19.711 --> 22:21.504
Eddie.

22:22.664 --> 22:25.462
- Back so soon?
- Well, you lied to us, Eddie.

22:25.874 --> 22:28.235
We know about Duncan and Mary Woodley.

22:29.109 --> 22:31.411
Alright, alright.

22:31.690 --> 22:34.033
I should've told you about her.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.513
I made a mistake, I'm sorry.

22:35.538 --> 22:37.067
What about Carl Ronson?

22:37.187 --> 22:39.630
We know he's been in contact
with you. Where is he, Eddie?

22:39.882 --> 22:42.499
Damn it. Do they know he's here?

22:42.949 --> 22:44.613
He's here, isn't he?

22:47.143 --> 22:50.184
How come there's two figures
there but only one actor?

22:51.184 --> 22:53.327
He begged me for a place to lay low.

22:53.369 --> 22:55.044
I didn't know what to do.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.638
Michelle.

23:02.554 --> 23:04.478
Hands behind your back.

23:12.195 --> 23:14.034
Let's go.

23:26.964 --> 23:29.265
Alright, there's no need to
make this difficult, Carl.

23:29.299 --> 23:31.316
We already know about
Mary's fling with Duncan.

23:31.349 --> 23:32.501
We also know you were angry

23:32.501 --> 23:34.803
- but were you angry enough to kill?
- No.

23:35.030 --> 23:37.853
Son of a bitch deserved to die.

23:38.282 --> 23:40.122
If you don't want to talk, that's fine.

23:40.242 --> 23:41.894
But we found your gun at the back room

23:41.928 --> 23:43.516
at Eddie's where you were staying.

23:43.734 --> 23:46.215
Your fingerprints were
the only ones found on it.

23:46.499 --> 23:49.314
So, the ballistics tests
will do the talking for you.

23:49.331 --> 23:50.952
I didn't shoot the guy, ok?

23:50.987 --> 23:53.709
But, I'm not sorry he's dead.

23:53.829 --> 23:56.139
When was the last time you saw him?

23:58.071 --> 23:59.971
Hey! I'm talking to you.

24:00.013 --> 24:02.719
I was not the man. I'm busy here.

24:05.054 --> 24:06.483
You were there, weren't you?

24:06.701 --> 24:09.138
- The day he was killed.
- I went there, ok?

24:09.258 --> 24:10.500
Not to kill him.

24:10.878 --> 24:12.903
Just wanted to scare him
into staying away from Mary.

24:13.023 --> 24:15.373
So what happened? He said the
wrong thing, you got angry...

24:15.390 --> 24:17.245
You're not listening to me.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.878
I didn't shoot him.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.525
My gun wasn't even loaded.

24:22.083 --> 24:24.519
So what happened between the two of you?

24:24.553 --> 24:26.754
Nothing. I barely even got his attention.

24:27.315 --> 24:29.374
I thought about bashing in his face.

24:29.659 --> 24:31.559
But I came to my senses and I left.

24:31.593 --> 24:33.752
Didn't want any trouble with the cops.

24:34.785 --> 24:36.491
Lot of good that did me.

24:36.611 --> 24:38.349
So why go into hiding?

24:38.550 --> 24:39.937
When I heard he was killed,

24:40.057 --> 24:41.677
I knew I'd look good for it.

24:42.828 --> 24:44.358
I didn't want Mary dragged into this

24:44.391 --> 24:46.257
so I asked Eddie to help
me lay low for a bit.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.459
It's my mess. Not his.

24:48.579 --> 24:51.346
Well, if you're innocent you've
got nothing to worry about.

24:51.947 --> 24:53.980
Cops see what they want to see.

25:05.225 --> 25:07.193
Ballistics came back on Carl's gun.

25:07.227 --> 25:09.228
It wasn't a match. It hadn't
even been fired recently.

25:09.296 --> 25:10.774
So, he was telling the truth.

25:10.816 --> 25:12.876
Yeah he was right about
something else, too.

25:12.901 --> 25:15.380
Whatever project Duncan was working
on was taking up all his time.

25:15.405 --> 25:16.657
He seemed disturbed by it.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.220
Could you see it in your read?

25:18.270 --> 25:19.321
Was there a monitor...?

25:19.329 --> 25:20.977
Just random numbers and symbols,

25:21.010 --> 25:22.868
kinda like a complex math equation.

25:22.901 --> 25:25.078
At least that's how Carl
processed what he had seen.

25:25.086 --> 25:26.060
Sounds like coding.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.792
And it's not uncommon to fix

25:27.817 --> 25:29.926
little bugs in the days
leading up to a big launch.

25:29.951 --> 25:31.917
- Yeah, that sounds right.
- I'll have the

25:31.951 --> 25:34.701
tech boys go through the raw
game files on Duncan's laptop

25:34.741 --> 25:36.989
and see if they flag anything.

25:37.056 --> 25:39.665
Well, I might even join them.

25:39.785 --> 25:42.868
If nothing else, it'll be nice to
see how his coding skills have evolved

25:42.901 --> 25:43.935
since the good old days.

25:43.935 --> 25:46.237
Sounds like a fantastic evening.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.295
Don't make fun. You have your baby...

25:48.346 --> 25:49.556
and I have mine.

25:49.564 --> 25:51.631
Well, I can't wait for the Christmas cards.

25:52.085 --> 25:53.455
Oh.

25:54.907 --> 25:58.362
I checked the call logs
on Duncan's office line

25:58.482 --> 26:01.169
and he called Simon Fields

26:01.211 --> 26:02.975
four times at Dynamic Solutions

26:03.009 --> 26:04.026
the day before he died.

26:04.051 --> 26:08.093
The same Simon Fields who said he
didn't speak to Duncan for days.

26:08.370 --> 26:09.286
Let's go.

26:10.908 --> 26:12.992
Yeah, that was my fault.

26:13.311 --> 26:15.395
Could you give us a moment, please?

26:18.194 --> 26:19.614
Look, I was travelling.

26:19.639 --> 26:21.824
I had my phone turned off
for the flight and I forgot

26:21.833 --> 26:23.085
to turn it back on, ok?

26:23.110 --> 26:25.279
Duncan's weren't the
only calls that I missed.

26:25.399 --> 26:27.901
- Where did you go?
- Just a day trip to Chicago.

26:27.943 --> 26:30.170
We were planning on opening
up a satellite office there.

26:30.187 --> 26:31.935
Do you know what he was calling you about?

26:31.977 --> 26:34.010
Said he team was turning in sub-par work.

26:34.027 --> 26:37.145
He said he needed additional library
elements to help pick up the slack.

26:37.641 --> 26:39.884
But he wanted the new
codes for the old rates.

26:40.004 --> 26:41.775
- I refused.
- That was it?

26:41.800 --> 26:43.927
Yeah, it was probably
just pre-launch jitters.

26:43.952 --> 26:46.877
From what I've seen so far, Orgre
Fury's a pretty amazing achievement.

26:46.997 --> 26:49.767
- Yes. It looks great.
- So you've played it?

26:50.717 --> 26:53.596
Have you gotten to level three?

26:54.762 --> 26:56.745
Well, nah. I've just seen the graphics,

26:56.795 --> 26:59.770
I didn't get to play
it. We, we've been busy.

26:59.890 --> 27:02.073
Uh, right. Yeah, what am I saying?

27:02.106 --> 27:04.434
Thank you for your time. We'll be in touch.

27:04.779 --> 27:06.358
Ok.

27:06.812 --> 27:09.011
Something is going on
here and I don't know what.

27:09.046 --> 27:11.480
Well, maybe we should talk to
someone closer to the situation.

27:11.514 --> 27:14.516
Someone with a sixth
sense for these things.

27:20.591 --> 27:23.492
- Thank you for seeing us again.
- I'm happy to help.

27:23.754 --> 27:26.745
- Are you the only one here?
- I sent everyone home.

27:26.761 --> 27:28.207
The game's out in the world. I...

27:28.327 --> 27:30.146
figured they earned a few days off.

27:30.165 --> 27:31.451
That's actually why we're here.

27:31.484 --> 27:35.431
In the last few days, did Duncan
mention anything unusual about his work?

27:35.551 --> 27:38.416
No. Not at all. But, he
wasn't much of a sharer.

27:38.536 --> 27:41.618
Well, I thought the work was a
bit of a collaborative process.

27:41.635 --> 27:44.215
It is, in the loosest sense of the term.

27:44.335 --> 27:46.761
Each level is programmed by
its own individual design team

27:46.769 --> 27:49.063
and then Duncan takes those
files, he stitches them together

27:49.080 --> 27:51.352
and filters them through
his own creative engine.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.923
He snatched level three from
us. Didn't trust our work.

27:54.957 --> 27:57.215
Well that sounds like it
would be hard on the team.

27:57.652 --> 27:59.383
Nothing new for Duncan.

27:59.503 --> 28:02.030
Just when you got your
foot in he'd pull the rug out.

28:02.150 --> 28:03.770
He said he had some ideas for

28:03.795 --> 28:04.955
spicing up level three

28:04.980 --> 28:07.374
and that he would finish
the programming himself.

28:08.904 --> 28:12.349
- Excuse me. I have to take this.
- Yeah.

28:13.341 --> 28:16.518
Sounds like Duncan was overly
protective of level three,

28:16.543 --> 28:18.325
I think it hurt her people
more than she admitted.

28:18.346 --> 28:20.518
I'll call Dev and have
him focus on that section.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.543
In the morning, we can take
another look at Vanessa's team,

28:22.594 --> 28:24.685
see how deep that resentment really ran.

28:30.391 --> 28:33.316
Hey, you want another one?

28:33.528 --> 28:35.098
I'm good.

28:36.164 --> 28:38.665
It's really messed up, what
happened to Dev's friend.

28:39.123 --> 28:40.997
Look, you gotta promise
me you're not gonna go

28:41.014 --> 28:42.098
and get yourself killed.

28:42.123 --> 28:44.838
It goes without saying, that is the plan.

28:44.958 --> 28:46.020
I'm being serious though.

28:46.140 --> 28:49.569
Ok? Look, I can't even
talk to a woman these days

28:49.595 --> 28:51.855
so, if I lose my best
friend, I'm dying alone.

28:55.939 --> 28:58.051
Oh, jeez. They're everywhere.

28:58.118 --> 28:58.905
Hey.

28:59.115 --> 29:00.905
Don't be so hard on yourself.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.560
Maybe you need a little practice, you know?

29:03.680 --> 29:06.502
Practice? Like, on what?
Like, a body pillow?

29:06.622 --> 29:09.191
Wait. Come here. Here, come here.

29:09.207 --> 29:10.905
- What?
- Talk to me like I'm a...

29:11.678 --> 29:15.544
a woman. A lady. Look, I'm alone, gorgeous.

29:16.846 --> 29:18.469
Come on. What are you waiting for?

29:18.589 --> 29:20.728
Ah, ok. Um.

29:21.392 --> 29:22.617
Can I buy you a drink?

29:22.737 --> 29:25.132
Let's be serious here.
You offered me a line.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.577
Don't give me a line. Be yourself.

29:27.697 --> 29:28.484
Seriously.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.949
- What do you want?
- Just be authentic. Be you.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.318
Ok.

29:35.215 --> 29:38.492
Alright. Let's do this.

29:39.349 --> 29:41.825
- Hi, my name is Oz.
- Hello.

29:43.223 --> 29:45.332
Before I say anything,
I should let you know

29:45.366 --> 29:47.970
that I'm a mess right now.

29:48.861 --> 29:50.785
I just broke up with
somebody that I thought

29:50.802 --> 29:52.388
was going to be my soulmate.

29:52.508 --> 29:55.675
So, I'm kind of on the verge
of an emotional breakdown.

29:55.969 --> 29:59.238
But, then I saw you

30:00.053 --> 30:02.978
and I realized that I don't
want to be one of those guys

30:02.978 --> 30:04.474
that ends up alone,

30:04.768 --> 30:06.860
unable to love anybody.

30:08.452 --> 30:10.895
I want to be able to make you laugh,

30:11.288 --> 30:12.953
make you feel safe,

30:14.180 --> 30:17.693
make you feel like you're the
most special person in the room.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.230
You know I've got a lot to offer.

30:19.247 --> 30:22.903
I'm the kind of guy you take
to meet your parents, or even,

30:23.172 --> 30:25.457
you know, take to your high
school reunion, we could do that.

30:25.469 --> 30:27.735
- Get a cabin in the woods. I...
- Yes.

30:28.071 --> 30:29.802
I'll have a drink with you.

30:30.525 --> 30:32.146
- That was good.
- Really, that worked?

30:32.146 --> 30:35.248
I mean, it was a bit needy, but
look, it was you. It was authentic.

30:35.278 --> 30:38.483
You're charming. Authentic Oz is charming.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.530
Yeah? Ok, authentic Oz. I can do that.

30:41.105 --> 30:43.190
That was so incredibly sweet.

30:43.310 --> 30:46.921
- You're such a lucky guy.
- Thank you.

30:47.795 --> 30:49.274
Wh...?

30:54.291 --> 30:56.551
- Did that really just happen?
- Yeah.

31:13.882 --> 31:15.528
Oh no.

31:34.502 --> 31:36.569
Nice moves.

31:39.577 --> 31:41.989
- Nice moves!
- Oh!

31:42.275 --> 31:46.233
My gosh that is really humiliating.

31:46.443 --> 31:49.309
I thought that I was the only
chronic night owl in the department.

31:49.359 --> 31:50.922
I didn't realize how late it got.

31:50.964 --> 31:52.771
I got wrapped up in some work.

31:52.821 --> 31:56.477
Oh, uh. Anything that I can help you with?

31:56.796 --> 32:00.754
Maybe. Um, do you know
how to read computer code?

32:01.317 --> 32:03.334
It's not something I usually

32:03.368 --> 32:05.805
tell boys but yeah, sure.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.526
I can hold my own.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.736
Great, 'cause I could use some fresh eyes.

32:10.736 --> 32:12.972
I think I found something
buried in Duncan's game code.

32:13.039 --> 32:14.400
What kind of something?

32:14.451 --> 32:16.434
Well, if it's what I think it is then,

32:16.467 --> 32:19.307
he's not just some
ego-driven perfectionist.

32:20.341 --> 32:22.215
He's a straight up criminal.

32:26.546 --> 32:28.311
The backdoor code was well-hidden.

32:28.328 --> 32:30.160
If I hadn't known to look
closely at level three,

32:30.202 --> 32:31.311
I probably would have missed it.

32:31.431 --> 32:33.131
So you would think that's
why Duncan was trying

32:33.133 --> 32:35.159
to get additional code library from Simon

32:35.168 --> 32:37.503
so that he could mask it under
another level of encryption.

32:37.537 --> 32:39.865
So this bad code does what exactly?

32:39.898 --> 32:42.487
It allows the programmer to hack
into the player's game system.

32:42.512 --> 32:45.108
From there, it's a snap to
steal credit card numbers

32:45.108 --> 32:47.554
or any other personal information
stored on the online account.

32:47.604 --> 32:49.940
So when you defeat the level three boss,

32:49.949 --> 32:52.083
you're not just unlocking the next level...

32:52.117 --> 32:53.369
They're unlocking their bank accounts.

32:53.386 --> 32:54.343
Wow.

32:54.553 --> 32:56.083
How much we looking at?

32:56.203 --> 32:58.948
Well, with a hundred million units
of the game already on the market,

32:58.973 --> 33:01.192
that's a number with a
heck of a lot of zeroes.

33:01.226 --> 33:03.571
The good news is that we should
be able to limit the damage.

33:03.596 --> 33:06.564
But it's gonna come at a cost. A game
recall would be all over the place.

33:06.599 --> 33:08.645
The perps would know that
we found out the code.

33:08.964 --> 33:11.409
So we lose the one card that we're holding.

33:12.577 --> 33:14.401
Do we know where the cash is going?

33:14.443 --> 33:17.183
Not exactly. The bad news is
the main cash flow is buried

33:17.216 --> 33:19.115
behind a continuously evolving code wall.

33:19.157 --> 33:23.527
- English.
- Pretend that the code is... a door.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.030
Now, we manage to jimmy the lock but,

33:25.048 --> 33:26.938
before we can get the door open,

33:26.955 --> 33:30.569
another door with an even
better lock slams shut behind it.

33:30.586 --> 33:31.822
So what's the good news?

33:31.847 --> 33:33.712
Well, I thought that he may
be working with a partner

33:33.746 --> 33:34.687
so, I kept looking.

33:34.687 --> 33:36.923
What I found was a secondary
stream in the cash-flow,

33:36.957 --> 33:38.410
only this account path

33:38.452 --> 33:40.898
had a small flaw in the code
and I was able to crack it.

33:41.018 --> 33:42.418
Do you have the account holder's name?

33:42.881 --> 33:44.553
I do.

33:51.638 --> 33:52.990
I don't understand.

33:53.016 --> 33:55.579
This is the first I've
heard about a backdoor code.

33:55.882 --> 33:57.260
I had nothing to do with this.

33:57.268 --> 33:58.966
We found the account in your name.

33:58.991 --> 34:02.042
- Your signature was used to open it.
- I swear, I don't have a secret account.

34:02.162 --> 34:04.067
I can hardly pay my credit card bills.

34:04.187 --> 34:06.554
What's happening? Why
won't they believe me?

34:07.017 --> 34:08.621
Why did you kill Duncan?

34:08.672 --> 34:10.983
Did you find out he was
lowballing your end of the score?

34:11.103 --> 34:13.141
Maybe he tried to cut you out completely?

34:13.722 --> 34:15.697
How can you say these things to me?

34:16.587 --> 34:18.159
I didn't do anything wrong.

34:18.453 --> 34:20.529
I would never hurt Duncan.

34:20.554 --> 34:23.371
I understood him better than anyone.

34:27.790 --> 34:30.202
- She's gotta be lying.
- No, no. Look.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.889
I don't think she did it. All I'm
getting is confusion and denial.

34:33.010 --> 34:34.789
- That's not what I wanna hear.
- Maybe she was set up.

34:34.813 --> 34:36.898
Duncan could've forged her
signature on the account.

34:36.922 --> 34:38.629
She's Duncan's second in command.

34:38.637 --> 34:40.478
I don't buy that she didn't
know what was going on

34:40.511 --> 34:42.217
- underneath her own nose.
- Look, I'm telling you, I thi...

34:42.234 --> 34:43.141
No, I'm telling you.

34:43.192 --> 34:45.965
I need more to go on
than a couple vague reads.

34:45.974 --> 34:48.487
So unless you've got a more
viable suspect on the table,

34:48.496 --> 34:50.966
you put her life under the microscope.

34:52.328 --> 34:53.900
He's wrong.

35:01.612 --> 35:04.937
Alright, what you got for
me corporal? What is this?

35:05.057 --> 35:08.300
Well, I was playing the
game and I got to this point.

35:08.502 --> 35:10.090
This is the level boss.

35:10.107 --> 35:11.283
Defeating him is the key

35:11.309 --> 35:13.468
to unlocking the console's
security safeguards.

35:13.519 --> 35:16.116
And that's when I realized I had
seen this point in the game before.

35:16.236 --> 35:17.578
When we spoke to Simon Fields,

35:17.592 --> 35:19.511
he asked me if I'd played Ogre Fury yet.

35:19.527 --> 35:21.847
And I saw this same
sequence running in his mind.

35:21.872 --> 35:24.880
So I thought him thinking about
the exact place in the game

35:24.922 --> 35:27.012
where the code was buried
couldn't be a coincidence.

35:27.014 --> 35:28.333
He had to be in on the scam.

35:28.367 --> 35:30.367
Why would Duncan bring
Simon Fields into it?

35:30.367 --> 35:32.274
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Stay with me.

35:32.527 --> 35:33.728
I'm trying.

35:33.848 --> 35:36.989
Ok, this is the original code that
Duncan bought from Dynamic Solutions.

35:38.266 --> 35:41.341
Ok, wait for it. Oh, you see this?

35:41.376 --> 35:43.812
Why don't you just cut to the
chase. Tell me what it means.

35:43.932 --> 35:46.207
What it means is that we've been looking

35:46.233 --> 35:48.022
at this whole thing backwards
right from the start.

35:48.048 --> 35:50.358
It wasn't Duncan who
programmed the bad code,

35:50.397 --> 35:52.400
it was embedded from the beginning. Sorry.

35:52.786 --> 35:53.980
Yeah?

35:54.022 --> 35:57.123
So Dynamic Solutions brought
the scam to Duncan, that's it?

35:57.165 --> 35:58.804
Well it may explain why Duncan had to die.

35:58.837 --> 36:00.341
They couldn't have any loose
ends pointed back at them.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.930
That was the team that
I sent to pick up Fields.

36:01.963 --> 36:04.955
His office has been
cleared out, we lost him.

36:06.417 --> 36:08.367
We'll find him.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.090
All right guys. I know cops and hackers

36:15.107 --> 36:17.190
don't get on so well but, um...

36:17.232 --> 36:18.661
As you know, one of our own,

36:18.669 --> 36:21.173
Duncan Quinn, was murdered and I
need your help to catch his killer

36:21.190 --> 36:22.862
before he disappears completely.

36:22.895 --> 36:24.963
Now each of you were chosen
because of your specific skills

36:24.996 --> 36:28.080
and your ability to gain access to
information that's off limits even to me.

36:28.200 --> 36:31.071
Now, I've given you all the
necessary intel on Simon Fields

36:31.080 --> 36:34.727
to get started so, happy hunting, kids.

36:36.291 --> 36:37.635
Ok.

36:37.837 --> 36:40.097
That's a good start,
Danny, but keep digging.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.769
- What's going on here?
- Dev's summoned the troops.

36:42.777 --> 36:44.458
Hey guys, I love the enthusiasm

36:44.492 --> 36:45.879
but, one at a time please.

36:45.879 --> 36:49.013
He's using the hacker community
to help track down our guy.

36:49.029 --> 36:52.433
Dev's network can utilize alternate
channels to get us intel quickly.

36:52.626 --> 36:53.786
How quickly?

36:53.828 --> 36:56.651
Well, it takes us hours. Takes him minutes.

36:56.771 --> 36:58.508
And these alternate channels,

36:58.541 --> 37:01.307
I presume they're strictly
legal. Is that right?

37:03.399 --> 37:06.382
Just forget I asked. Get it done.

37:07.466 --> 37:10.449
Guys, I got some information
on Dynamic Solutions.

37:10.475 --> 37:12.960
Uh, it seems legit on the surface

37:12.962 --> 37:15.743
but I was able to access
some buried financial records

37:15.775 --> 37:18.357
and the code farms are nothing
more than fraud factories

37:18.382 --> 37:21.002
and there's not one shred
of paper that leads back

37:21.004 --> 37:22.886
to any specific individual except for one.

37:22.912 --> 37:25.164
- Simon Fields.
- And he doesn't exist.

37:25.206 --> 37:27.835
Ok? It's an assumed ID. And a good one,

37:27.860 --> 37:31.390
but not good enough. My girl,
Blackcat77, found three other IDs

37:31.432 --> 37:33.113
with the exact same layers of encryption.

37:33.138 --> 37:35.020
So they were all created
by the same person?

37:35.029 --> 37:35.874
Bingo.

37:35.994 --> 37:39.273
And... looks like only
one of those IDs is active.

37:39.810 --> 37:42.474
Greg Miles. We have a
credit card under his name.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.003
We're tracking his movement.

37:44.407 --> 37:46.843
Hey guys, I'm back. I'm sorry, I was AFK.

37:48.062 --> 37:49.146
Uh huh.

37:49.507 --> 37:51.725
Looks like there was a hotel
booked under the credit card,

37:51.845 --> 37:54.608
but he checked out this morning
and he booked a town car.

37:54.624 --> 37:55.709
When's the pickup?

37:55.742 --> 37:58.204
It's at 20 minutes ago. Should
I notify the car service?

37:58.246 --> 37:59.288
No, he might be armed.

37:59.313 --> 38:01.832
I don't want this turning
into a hostage situation.

38:01.859 --> 38:04.364
Guys, I'm going to need
a route on the limo.

38:04.599 --> 38:05.714
Perfect.

38:05.834 --> 38:07.414
Alright guys, keep tracking him.

38:07.458 --> 38:10.008
It looks like he's headed westbound
on the lakeshore towards the key.

38:10.011 --> 38:12.061
Yeah, what do we have down there?

38:12.129 --> 38:14.154
Island airport?

38:18.078 --> 38:19.633
And he chartered a private plane.

38:19.649 --> 38:21.893
Ok, well he's going to have to
go through customs at the airport.

38:21.918 --> 38:23.440
After that, he might be out of our reach.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.549
Guys I need you to have some fun, alright?

38:25.557 --> 38:26.985
Throw up some roadblocks to this limo.

38:26.994 --> 38:29.775
Make sure they hit every
red light. Buy me some time.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.253
Attention all passengers,

38:35.295 --> 38:39.841
this is the final boarding
call for flight 107 to Chicago.

38:39.961 --> 38:44.262
I repeat, final boarding call
for flight 107 to Chicago.

39:01.231 --> 39:02.777
Simon Fields?

39:03.415 --> 39:06.381
Or do you prefer Greg Miles?

39:08.139 --> 39:12.063
On the ground, now! Now! Get down!

39:12.071 --> 39:15.155
Out of the way. IIB everyone, stay calm.

39:15.407 --> 39:17.240
You looking for this?
Get down, on your knees.

39:18.626 --> 39:20.515
Get down, on your knees.

39:20.517 --> 39:22.022
There must be some kind of mistake.

39:22.324 --> 39:23.644
There's no mistake.

39:23.665 --> 39:26.133
You killed Duncan Quinn.

39:28.676 --> 39:30.285
You sabotaged my game.

39:30.307 --> 39:32.661
I'm pulling the plug. Taking you down.

39:37.413 --> 39:40.775
Your mistake was you should have
never targeted one of my friends.

39:42.684 --> 39:44.682
Hey.

39:45.253 --> 39:46.742
I just read him.

39:46.943 --> 39:49.372
Duncan wasn't a part of
it, he was trying to fix it.

39:49.397 --> 39:51.011
That's why he was killed.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.497
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.203
How'd it go?

40:18.405 --> 40:22.220
Well, turns out Fields was wanted
for several international crimes.

40:22.262 --> 40:23.890
And he admitted to the murder,

40:23.909 --> 40:25.380
but he's gunning for leniency

40:25.405 --> 40:27.044
in exchange for giving up his bosses.

40:27.069 --> 40:28.497
Becker's not gonna cut a deal?

40:28.531 --> 40:30.724
Nah, nah. We've got
everything we need up here.

40:30.749 --> 40:34.001
Including the location of the account
where the money was being transferred.

40:34.026 --> 40:35.700
Becker's putting a hold on it now.

40:35.768 --> 40:37.669
I'm just glad that Duncan was cleared.

40:37.737 --> 40:40.522
He may not be the same easy
going guy that I remember,

40:41.262 --> 40:42.850
but in the end, he tried
to do the right thing.

40:42.970 --> 40:44.505
It's a shame he had to lose his life.

40:44.625 --> 40:47.446
He could've gone to the police he
didn't have to try to fix it himself.

40:47.447 --> 40:49.883
Guess you gotta understand
the gaming business, right?

40:50.003 --> 40:52.513
Even a little delay of a
few weeks would have been

40:52.530 --> 40:54.816
a massive hit to his
cash flow and reputation.

40:54.936 --> 40:57.530
Hey. Don't wanna break up the party,

40:57.547 --> 40:59.698
I just wanna let you guys
know that Vanessa Reinhold's

40:59.749 --> 41:01.496
been released. Cleared of all charges.

41:01.530 --> 41:04.160
Why did they try to set
her up in the first place?

41:04.196 --> 41:06.748
Well, Fields knew that once we got to her,

41:06.798 --> 41:09.471
it meant the code had been
discovered. So, that was his cue to

41:09.504 --> 41:10.353
get out of town.

41:10.378 --> 41:12.277
Thankfully, your weird
brain thing helped stop

41:12.311 --> 41:13.177
that from happening.

41:13.202 --> 41:15.520
- Hey, I'll take that as a compliment.
- Yeah, take it as you want.

41:15.546 --> 41:18.185
You guys wanna come over to my
buddy's bar for a few drinks?

41:18.647 --> 41:21.672
Ah, thanks, no. I've gotta
jet, but have a good time.

41:21.916 --> 41:24.747
I am going to try to see my
baby before she goes to bed.

41:24.747 --> 41:25.857
Alright.

41:26.604 --> 41:28.352
That leaves the two of us.

41:30.301 --> 41:32.129
Mmm no, I'm going to sit this one out.

41:32.134 --> 41:34.327
I'm gonna crush some ogres.

41:34.697 --> 41:36.360
Alright.

42:00.609 --> 42:03.285
- Hey. Eh! Eh! Eh!
- What? Come on.

42:03.894 --> 42:06.558
What? I'm getting the hang of this. C'mon.

42:06.583 --> 42:08.272
- Be right back.
- Ooh.

42:10.810 --> 42:13.162
'Scuse me? Hi. Um.

42:14.153 --> 42:15.664
Hi.

42:15.943 --> 42:19.498
Um, I was standing over there,

42:19.506 --> 42:24.162
holding these darts and I wanted
to come over and ask you...

42:25.086 --> 42:27.564
Will you marry me?

42:28.044 --> 42:30.312
Well, I don't know.

42:30.539 --> 42:32.312
Do you need an answer right now?

42:32.348 --> 42:34.657
No. Not necessarily. I mean, we could

42:34.690 --> 42:37.606
start with a coffee and see
where it goes from there.

42:37.632 --> 42:40.463
You know, weigh the pros
and cons. It's a big step.

42:42.816 --> 42:48.110
- Coffee sounds great.
- Great, ok. I'm Oz, by the way.

42:48.152 --> 42:50.160
I guess I could've opened with that.

42:50.280 --> 42:51.883
- Lisa.
- Lisa...

42:52.003 --> 42:55.353
And for the record, I
kinda liked your opener.

42:55.648 --> 42:58.202
Good. Good. Ok.

42:58.883 --> 42:59.822
Ok.

43:01.509 --> 43:03.548
- Did you see that?
- I saw that.

43:03.579 --> 43:04.816
- Did you see that?
- Who's back?

43:04.936 --> 43:07.077
- I might be back.
- Who's the boss?

43:07.115 --> 43:09.264
That's a valid question.

43:09.304 --> 43:10.901
You get her number?

43:11.021 --> 43:12.959
You got her phone number, right?

43:13.279 --> 43:14.502
I'll be right back.
