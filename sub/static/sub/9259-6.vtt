00:57.208 --> 00:59.642
Nice to see you, man. 

00:59.744 --> 01:01.371
[Car Door Closes]

01:01.479 --> 01:04.414
- How was your week?
- It was okay.

01:04.515 --> 01:07.075
- How was yours?
- Smooth.

01:07.185 --> 01:08.880
Matter of fact,
I hit a trifecta.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.546
Lost a half million dollars
in product in the church seizure.

01:11.656 --> 01:14.181
Six of my top soldiers
got busted.

01:14.292 --> 01:19.252
But the highlight was
the El Salvadorans cut off my supply.

01:19.364 --> 01:21.457
You'll find a new pipeline
to tap.

01:21.566 --> 01:26.333
Yeah, but in the meantime, how are we
gonna get back all that money / lost?

01:26.437 --> 01:30.806
[Shane] You're a drug dealer. Why don't you
consider it the cost of doing business?

01:30.908 --> 01:33.468
So you're saying
my business model's flawed?

01:35.813 --> 01:38.373
Maybe / need a new partner.

01:38.483 --> 01:41.816
Buy-in's 20 grand, cash,
my hands by tomorrow.

01:41.919 --> 01:44.114
I thought you didn't smoke
the shit you sold. Come on, man.

01:44.222 --> 01:46.315
I don't have that kind
of cash lying around.

01:46.424 --> 01:48.449
Look, man,
I know you been skimmin'.

01:48.559 --> 01:51.050
Consider it the cost
of doin' business.

01:51.162 --> 01:53.130
[Sighs]

01:55.500 --> 01:58.333
Plus, one more thing.

01:58.436 --> 02:00.961
What?

02:06.911 --> 02:10.711
- That's Kozodav? Man, he doesn't look all that.
- [Chuckles]

02:10.815 --> 02:14.581
Don't let him fool ya. His enemies
are all fish food in the L.A. River.

02:14.685 --> 02:16.585
- That's Kozodav's car?
- [Mackey] Yeah.

02:16.687 --> 02:18.678
Cover me while I replace
the hard drive underneath.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.122
Dudes are 30 feet away.
Can't we do it later?

02:21.225 --> 02:24.592
The hard drive is full, and Kozodav's
been talkin' about somethin' big.

02:24.695 --> 02:27.163
/f something's on that disk,
we gotta know pronto.

02:27.265 --> 02:30.496
Forget what these guys been talkin'about.
What's Shane been sayin'to Antwon?

02:30.601 --> 02:32.535
Nothing incriminating.

02:32.637 --> 02:34.571
- Have you seen the tapes?
- Ronnie has.

02:34.672 --> 02:37.300
Don't worry about it.
We're watchin

02:42.180 --> 02:45.206
Oh, shit.
Russians are coming.

02:45.316 --> 02:47.216
Hurry up.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.222
[Man Speaking Russian]

02:52.323 --> 02:56.487
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Can I help you, Officer?

02:56.594 --> 02:59.119
I thought the Moscow Ballet was in town,
and then I saw the ink.

02:59.230 --> 03:03.132
New policy says I gotta get name, rank
and serial number, comrade. Let's go.

03:03.234 --> 03:05.794
Save the shakedowns
for the niggers and spics.

03:05.903 --> 03:08.895
I got a Jew lawyer.
His name is Paul Hirschheimer.

03:09.006 --> 03:11.566
You wanna talk with me,
call him.

03:11.676 --> 03:14.474
- Got a gun.
- Coppin' an attitude, one thing.

03:14.579 --> 03:17.343
Coppin' a Glock is another.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.780
Might be time to get
thatJew on the phone.

03:19.884 --> 03:21.977
He's a bodyguard.
He's got a permit to carry.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.092
[Sighs]

03:31.162 --> 03:35.292
Well, I'm afraid I owe
you gentlemen an apology.

03:35.399 --> 03:38.368
You won't be bothered again.

03:38.469 --> 03:42.132
Video transfer of the hard drive
we pulled from Kozodav's car last night.

03:42.240 --> 03:46.370
He hired someone to torch a building
to pay off an insurance scam.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.775
- Mention when?
- No. But the contract's out.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.111
- Could happen as early as today.
- Know the arsonist's name or the target?

03:52.216 --> 03:54.116
Nothing.
It sounds residential.

03:54.218 --> 03:57.654
Shithead joked there were only
Mexicans living there.

03:57.755 --> 04:00.019
If we arrest him right now,
how bad can we hurt him?

04:00.124 --> 04:03.150
We've got over 10 counts
of extortion, racketeering, grand theft.

04:03.261 --> 04:05.422
- He'll do a minimum 20.
- So we bring him in...

04:05.530 --> 04:07.998
use that as leverage to get him
to give up the arsonist.

04:08.099 --> 04:10.260
I think it's time we shut
this thing down, declared victory.

04:10.368 --> 04:12.768
I'll call the chief.
Get a team together.

04:12.870 --> 04:15.031
Bring him in.

04:15.139 --> 04:17.699
[Exhales Forcefully, Chuckles]

04:17.808 --> 04:19.935
Vic, / had some doubts...

04:20.043 --> 04:23.775
about you handling both the seizures
and the garage sting...

04:23.881 --> 04:25.906
but great work.

04:26.017 --> 04:28.008
/ couldn't have done it
without Ronnie.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.323
Nice work.

04:34.559 --> 04:37.619
Big Chief, Vic needum new
driving machine...

04:37.728 --> 04:39.286
so he can catchum bad guy.

04:39.397 --> 04:42.525
Knew you had some Spanish.
Didn't know you knew smoke signals.

04:42.633 --> 04:46.592
Hey, there's a criminal somewhere
out there drivin' my new ride.

04:46.704 --> 04:50.071
I got two Laker tickets
for the one who seizes it first.

04:50.174 --> 04:54.440
- What do you have in mind?
- Hey, Dutch-boy. What are you driving these days?

04:54.545 --> 04:57.105
- Subaru.
- Anything but a Subaru.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.274
- [Cops Chuckling]
- All right. We'll have you riding in style in no time.

05:00.384 --> 05:03.217
Somethin'fast. / can't take down
these R.O.C. assholes...

05:03.321 --> 05:05.346
goin' zero to 60
in four minutes.

05:06.424 --> 05:08.324
Let's find the big guy
a new car.

05:10.161 --> 05:12.629
So, are we gonna bust
these Russians or what?

05:12.730 --> 05:15.699
Captain's runnin'late.
We can't start without her.

05:17.802 --> 05:21.465
Bringin' him back wasn't my idea. Captain
wanted someone from Juvie in-house.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.769
- Yeah, sure, whatever.
- All right.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.969
You all know your assignments.
Take up positions in 20 minutes.

05:28.079 --> 05:30.343
Hold off, everyone.

05:30.448 --> 05:32.643
- What's going on?
- Change in plans.

05:35.086 --> 05:37.452
[Aceveda] That church
you raided last week?

05:39.991 --> 05:43.154
- [Men Shouting On TV]
- [People Screaming]

05:43.260 --> 05:45.228
Hold it. Muncelle!

05:48.399 --> 05:51.766
[Screaming Continues]

05:51.869 --> 05:53.496
[Shouting Continues]

05:57.408 --> 06:01.242
That is not how it went down.
People were not screaming.

06:01.345 --> 06:04.542
This tape has been edited.
Where's the untouched version?

06:04.649 --> 06:06.514
This is the version
the local news stations have.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.142
- It hits the air tonight at 6:00.
- [Monica] Where did we get it from?

06:09.253 --> 06:12.120
My press secretary had it slipped to him
as a favor by a reporter.

06:12.223 --> 06:15.852
- Does he have the original?
- [Aceveda] / don't think so.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.428
But I'd worry more about
how you're gonna spin this nightmare.

06:18.529 --> 06:22.226
/ have 12 kilos ofheroin in my
evidence room. That's all the spin / need.

06:22.333 --> 06:25.200
Public Relations
is working on our response.

06:25.302 --> 06:29.398
In the meantime, the Organized Crime Unit
is gonna handle the Kozodav sweep.

06:29.507 --> 06:31.668
This is John Sullivan,
their team leader.

06:31.776 --> 06:34.040
Congratulations.
You guys did a hell of a job.

06:34.145 --> 06:37.205
- Put together a great case.
- Yeah. Our goddamn case!

06:37.314 --> 06:39.441
We worked long and hard
on this case, Roy.

06:39.550 --> 06:41.484
We deserve to make this bust.

06:41.585 --> 06:43.485
Getting Kozodav
is a big win for us.

06:43.587 --> 06:45.919
We can't risk tainting it by having
the arresting officer...

06:46.023 --> 06:47.224
and his captain plastered
all over the news the same day.

06:47.224 --> 06:49.658
and his captain plastered
all over the news the same day.

06:51.829 --> 06:55.890
He has been pissing
on this policy from day one.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.060
Last quarter's numbers. For all
the great work you've been doing...

06:59.170 --> 07:01.968
crime is actually up
four percent in this district.

07:02.073 --> 07:04.564
/ promised my constituents
that / would review...

07:04.675 --> 07:07.576
all of these seizures
on a one-by-one basis...

07:07.678 --> 07:10.545
and I expect full access
to all of your files.

07:12.817 --> 07:15.377
Detective Mackey will get you
up to speed on the op...

07:15.486 --> 07:17.784
provide you any support
you need.

07:17.888 --> 07:21.324
- All clear?
- Crystal.

07:22.660 --> 07:26.118
[Rock]

07:26.230 --> 07:28.790
[Men, Women Chattering]

07:28.899 --> 07:31.800
[Ends]

07:33.938 --> 07:37.465
I'll look into the tape.
Try and track down the original.

07:37.575 --> 07:39.566
We'll get through this.

07:39.677 --> 07:41.804
In the meantime, Shane
brought over a case from Vice.

07:41.912 --> 07:43.812
- Work it with him.
- What is it?

07:43.914 --> 07:46.747
He found a Byz Lat in the state pen
willing to act as an informant...

07:46.851 --> 07:48.978
in return for early release.

07:49.086 --> 07:51.350
Prison Bureau almost
never grants early release.

07:51.455 --> 07:54.481
Yeah, well, the chief went to bat
with the bureau himself.

07:54.592 --> 07:57.561
Shane's informant is banger buddies
with Ernesto Dienta...

07:57.661 --> 07:59.561
Byz Lat contraband king.

07:59.663 --> 08:01.790
Guns, drugs.
You name it, he gets it.

08:01.899 --> 08:05.198
- Not for long.
- Use Lemansky.

08:05.302 --> 08:08.066
I'd like to see how your old
Strike Team works together.

08:08.172 --> 08:10.436
- Great.
- Any progress on Lem's missing girl?

08:10.541 --> 08:12.441
Still working on it.

08:12.543 --> 08:15.239
I'm not feeling a happy ending
to that story.

08:15.346 --> 08:17.405
Captain, / got a call
from Mission Cross.

08:17.515 --> 08:21.042
A little girl was just brought into the E.R.
with burns to her throat and face.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.985
- What happened?
- They think she was forced to drink
some kind of acid.

08:24.088 --> 08:26.556
- Doctors are treating her now.
- How old is she?

08:26.657 --> 08:28.386
According to the foster dad,
seven.

08:28.492 --> 08:30.517
- She's a foster kid.
- Yeah.

08:30.628 --> 08:32.596
Give me a minute.
I'll join you.

08:35.131 --> 08:38.794
This is Hielo Gutierrez. He did
a nickel in Chino for armed robbery.

08:38.903 --> 08:41.929
[Shane] Covered his Byz Lat homies'
asses when he got pinched.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.768
Thanked him by visiting him
once during his stretch.

08:43.874 --> 08:47.002
That's once more than /'ll be seeing
those fools when they're behind bars.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.602
Payback's gonna taste sweeter
than teenage booty.

08:49.713 --> 08:51.704
Hielo's only been a citizen
for a month.

08:51.816 --> 08:53.943
His buddy Ernesto's
integrating him back into the fold.

08:54.051 --> 08:56.383
- You ready?
- Where we headed?

08:56.487 --> 08:59.854
Echo Park. Ernesto and Hielo
have a meeting...

08:59.957 --> 09:03.518
with a busboy who works
on an Indian reservation in Cabazon.

09:03.627 --> 09:07.188
- What's the grift?
- Cigarettes. Indians buy 'em tax free.

09:07.298 --> 09:10.563
Byz Lats turn 'em around for face value.
The tax is pure profit.

09:10.668 --> 09:12.761
Across the state lines.
That makes it a federal beef.

09:12.870 --> 09:15.771
When it comes time to make the bust,
we can R/CO their asses.

09:15.873 --> 09:17.773
Sweep up half
the Byz Lats.

09:19.410 --> 09:23.847
I learned from the best.
Vic and me will ride together.

09:23.948 --> 09:26.781
You ride with Army and Hielo.
Ready?

09:26.884 --> 09:28.852
Let's go.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.782
Look, stay cool.
Play the good soldier, all right?

09:36.894 --> 09:38.919
That guy with Hielo-
that's Ernesto.

09:39.029 --> 09:41.520
He's the Byz Lat
contraband king.

09:41.632 --> 09:44.465
I guess he's gonna have to
run his kingdom from a cell in Chino.

09:46.437 --> 09:48.769
- The other Mexican- that's Garcia.
- [Chattering]

09:48.873 --> 09:51.706
He's the one who works
on the /ndian reservation.

09:51.809 --> 09:55.836
- I've been known to get
my hands on a pack or two.
- I need cartons. Lots of them.

09:55.946 --> 09:58.915
- I can get 300 cartons a month.
- How much?

09:59.016 --> 10:01.382
Ten thousand, in cash,
on delivery.

10:04.421 --> 10:07.288
Got him hooked,
about to get booked.

10:11.295 --> 10:14.264
That was quick. I hope you
didn't mind me calling your cell phone.

10:14.365 --> 10:16.492
Not at all. Corrine Mackey,
this is Captain Monica Rawling.

10:16.600 --> 10:20.036
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. How's the girl?

10:20.137 --> 10:24.198
Joya's unconscious. Her esophagus is badly
burned, and there's stomach damage.

10:24.308 --> 10:27.766
- She's been put on a ventilator.
- Where are the parents?

10:27.878 --> 10:29.869
That's her foster father
over there.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.880
He brought her in.

10:31.982 --> 10:34.041
There are also signs
of a sexual assault.

10:34.151 --> 10:36.051
We're waiting for the results
of the rape kit.

10:36.153 --> 10:38.246
- What did she swallow?
- Some sort ofhousehold cleaner.

10:38.355 --> 10:40.823
Should have killed her.
/t still might.

10:40.925 --> 10:42.893
- Can we see her?
- [Door Opens]

10:55.272 --> 10:59.003
- [Monica] Child Services?
- They're sending over a caseworker now.

10:59.109 --> 11:01.077
Yeah, that'll fix everything.

11:01.178 --> 11:04.045
- Is Joya in a private or a group home?
- [Corrine] / don't know.

11:04.148 --> 11:07.982
Could be an attempt by the rapist
to destroy D.N.A. evidence.

11:08.085 --> 11:12.545
If the sexual assault extended
to, uh, an oral nature.

11:12.656 --> 11:15.420
Thanks for calling right away.

11:15.526 --> 11:18.051
Bring the foster care father to the Barn.
Get his take on what happened.

11:18.162 --> 11:20.323
We'll run by his house,
see what we can learn.

11:20.431 --> 11:24.026
- You're splitting us up?
- I'm just marshaling our resources.

11:26.503 --> 11:29.063
- Hi. Come on in.
- Hi.
- Captain Rawling.

11:29.173 --> 11:31.141
- Claudette Wyms.
- Hi. How's Joya?

11:31.241 --> 11:33.209
- She's suffered a lot of damage.
- /t's terrible.

11:33.310 --> 11:35.210
These children
have so many problems.

11:35.312 --> 11:38.110
- They experience violence, and they get violent.
- Hi.

11:38.215 --> 11:41.150
- Who was home?
- All the kids. We have seven with us now.

11:41.251 --> 11:43.811
Frank was here,
I was out getting groceries...

11:43.921 --> 11:46.287
and he called me
on his way to the hospital.

11:46.390 --> 11:48.585
- Hi. What's your name?
- Bibi.

11:48.692 --> 11:50.683
We need to see
all the children.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.887
Okay. Gather everybody.
Bring 'em back to the living room.

11:52.997 --> 11:54.897
Can you show us where
your husband found Joya?

11:54.999 --> 11:58.298
- Sure. This way.
- [Children Chattering]

11:59.737 --> 12:04.265
Uh, this is the kids'bathroom.
Over here.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.741
Sorry about the smell.
Joya threw up.

12:06.844 --> 12:09.904
You found an empty bottle
of drain cleaner. Where is it?

12:10.014 --> 12:13.040
I'll ask Bibi. She's the oldest.
She looks out for the younger ones.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.448
These meds belong
to all the kids?

12:15.552 --> 12:18.453
Yeah.
They're all taking something.

12:18.555 --> 12:20.682
Like I said,
they have problems.

12:20.791 --> 12:22.691
Why is a padlock
on this door?

12:22.793 --> 12:26.092
Oh, the closet
is our safe place.

12:30.401 --> 12:33.165
[Claudette] Safe for who?
You lock the kids up in here?

12:33.270 --> 12:35.170
[Woman] Yeah. We give them
time-outs on occasion.

12:35.272 --> 12:37.365
Most of them
have behavioral disorders.

12:37.474 --> 12:39.840
This lets them calm down,
keeps the other kids safe.

12:39.943 --> 12:43.504
You realize you've admitted
to child endangerment?

12:43.614 --> 12:45.548
My husband says it's not.

12:45.649 --> 12:48.948
/ mean, people send kids
to their rooms, right?

12:49.053 --> 12:51.544
This is the only space we have.

12:51.655 --> 12:54.385
Any of the kids capable
of attacking Joya?

12:54.491 --> 12:56.755
- Making her drink Drano?
- Take your pick.

12:56.927 --> 12:59.919
- Got an update?
- Yeah. The prelim just came back.

13:00.030 --> 13:04.194
Joya wasn't raped this morning.
The healing looks to be 24 to 48 hours.

13:04.301 --> 13:06.132
- What about the father?
- Definitely a control freak...

13:06.236 --> 13:09.933
so the closet o' horrors
doesn't surprise me.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.941
- Not sure he's a rapist though.
- The files from the foster care kids?

13:13.043 --> 13:16.444
Yeah, Child Services just sent 'em over.
They read like the Marquis de Sade.

13:16.547 --> 13:18.606
One of'em's probably
our liquid plumber.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.513
So, we have six suspects.

13:21.618 --> 13:24.143
- You mean seven.
- I'm not counting Joya.

13:24.254 --> 13:26.188
- Neither am /.
- [Claudette] There were six kids.

13:26.290 --> 13:30.818
- We met them all.
- Not according to these C.S. documents.

13:30.928 --> 13:32.896
Yeah?

13:34.998 --> 13:37.057
Darnell Garry, age 17.

13:37.167 --> 13:40.967
Bipolar.
A history of violence.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.232
So where is he?

13:43.340 --> 13:45.900
Tell us about Darnell Garry.

13:46.009 --> 13:49.308
He was the oldest.
Ran away about three months ago.

13:49.413 --> 13:53.543
- You never called Children's Services?
- / did. Also sent an e-mail.

13:53.650 --> 13:55.743
/ can print it out for you.

13:55.853 --> 13:58.219
They never wrote or called
to check on his status?

13:58.322 --> 14:00.381
No. Trust me, lady...

14:00.491 --> 14:02.516
I've been working
for the county a long time.

14:02.626 --> 14:06.027
- / know how to cover my ass.
- You kept cashing Darnell's checks after he left.

14:06.130 --> 14:09.691
How are you gonna cover your ass
on that one?

14:09.800 --> 14:13.964
My wife handles the books.
We get a lot of checks for these kids.

14:14.071 --> 14:15.971
It's hard to know
the difference.

14:16.073 --> 14:19.804
We caught the mistake last month.
Sent them an e-mail to bill us.

14:19.910 --> 14:22.208
You don't seem too broken up
Darnell took off.

14:22.312 --> 14:25.247
Darnell was uncontrollable.

14:25.349 --> 14:28.682
Belonged in a hospital
or a prison, not my house.

14:29.987 --> 14:32.785
Sounds like your closet therapy
didn't take, huh?

14:34.124 --> 14:36.092
Child endangerment's a crime.

14:36.193 --> 14:38.093
[Monica]
Consider your foster care license gone.

14:38.195 --> 14:41.096
How hard we press charges,
that's in your court.

14:41.198 --> 14:43.928
When was the last time
you saw Darnell?

14:44.034 --> 14:46.002
A couple weeks ago.

14:46.103 --> 14:49.334
Caught him in the house
when he thought Liz and I were gone...

14:49.439 --> 14:52.465
stealing groceries,
other kids' prescriptions.

14:52.576 --> 14:54.476
Any idea where he went
after that?

14:54.578 --> 14:59.948
[Sighs] Try his mom. She's a junkie.
Him too, probably.

15:00.050 --> 15:02.678
The only meds he didn't take were
the ones that actually might help him.

15:06.023 --> 15:08.890
The dad reported Darnell Garry
left months ago.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.552
How come someone didn't file
a missing persons report with us?

15:11.662 --> 15:14.722
There's no record of him
being missing.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.493
This is a copy
of the e-mail he sent you.

15:17.601 --> 15:19.501
He's been gone for three months.

15:19.603 --> 15:23.471
How many visits have you
had there since then?

15:23.574 --> 15:27.442
- Two.
- And you didn't notice
one of the kids was missing?

15:27.544 --> 15:30.980
The checks were never stopped.
Darnell was never flagged for a follow-up.

15:31.081 --> 15:33.879
You know who ends up doing
that follow-up? My cops or the M.E.

15:33.984 --> 15:36.145
Half these kids are gonna
end up in the penal system.

15:36.253 --> 15:38.778
They're time bombs. We shuffle them
around from place to place...

15:38.889 --> 15:41.289
Iose track of them
until they explode.

15:41.391 --> 15:44.519
Look, /'m here as a courtesy.

15:44.628 --> 15:47.358
If you wanna lecture about
the foster care system...

15:47.464 --> 15:49.489
teach an extension class
at UCLA.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.693
I understand the difficulties
and limitations.

15:51.802 --> 15:54.669
I deal with my own,
but we have got to do better.

15:54.771 --> 15:56.671
No, you mean I've got to do better.

15:56.773 --> 16:01.301
/f we got a missing teen, stop taking it
out on me and do something to find him.

16:01.411 --> 16:04.676
In Domestic, I had to watch
you people on a daily basis.

16:04.781 --> 16:08.308
I saw more concern for filling
federally funded beds...

16:08.418 --> 16:10.318
than in helping
reunite families.

16:10.420 --> 16:14.049
We've got tens of thousands
of kids to care for.

16:14.157 --> 16:16.819
- This is one mistake.
- This is a kid!

16:16.927 --> 16:20.260
So's the one in the hospital
with half a throat.

16:20.364 --> 16:23.424
You don't like my job performance,
call my supervisor.

16:23.533 --> 16:25.558
Fine. I'll explain
why you've been arrested.

16:25.669 --> 16:28.467
- Hey! For what?
- Negligence, child endangerment.

16:28.572 --> 16:31.097
You were assigned to that household,
so I'm holding you responsible.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.574
- Officer, take him.
- What's she doing?

16:33.677 --> 16:37.078
- [Man] Hey.
- Standing on her soapbox.

16:37.180 --> 16:40.741
She, uh, have her own,
or you let her borrow yours?

16:42.286 --> 16:45.778
[Rap]

16:45.889 --> 16:50.417
- What's the problem, Officer?
- Your plates are expired, Illinois.

16:50.527 --> 16:52.859
License, registration.

16:52.963 --> 16:56.160
You boys are enjoying the party.
/ smell marijuana.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.133
All right. Get out of the car.
Step out now, all of you. Move it!

16:59.236 --> 17:01.329
[Man] Come on, man.
We'rejust seeing the sights.

17:01.438 --> 17:05.238
- Put your hands on top
of your head and turn around.
- Let's go. Come on. Step forward.

17:05.342 --> 17:07.708
- [Danny] You boys affiliated?
- What?

17:07.810 --> 17:11.178
- Gang ink. You got any?
- Hey.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.112
8th Street. What is that?
Your Boy Scout troop?

17:13.215 --> 17:15.980
We ain't got no business here.
We're just visiting my cousin. That's it.

17:16.086 --> 17:19.578
- Step back.
- I'll let your cousin know
when your visiting hours are.

17:25.028 --> 17:26.996
Danny.

17:27.097 --> 17:31.932
Hey, Vic, / think we got your new official
department-issue ride.

17:32.035 --> 17:34.629
- [Vic] Oh.
- Chicago homeboys with too much narcotics.

17:34.738 --> 17:39.038
You make that stick,
those tickets are all yours.

17:39.142 --> 17:42.009
- Oh, leather seats!
- Fully loaded.

17:42.112 --> 17:45.047
For you,
I'll even throw in dinner.

17:48.752 --> 17:51.243
[Chattering]

17:56.193 --> 18:00.357
- What happened?
- O.C.U. sat on Kozi cabs for two hours.

18:00.464 --> 18:02.398
Half the Russian mob showed,
Kozodav didn't.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.024
Sullivan made the call
to go in anyway.

18:05.135 --> 18:08.195
- Kozodav's in the wind?
- Yeah, Sullivan said he had no choice.

18:08.305 --> 18:10.205
A residential building
was about to be torched.

18:10.307 --> 18:12.207
He figured he'd
press the soldiers...

18:12.309 --> 18:14.209
and use them to give up
Kozodav's location.

18:14.311 --> 18:16.779
They're all asking for lawyers.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.472
Monica got you up to speed?

18:18.582 --> 18:21.380
- She gave me the ABC's.
- Good. We need your help.

18:21.485 --> 18:25.251
I'll get my team together,
start digging into Kozodav's haunts.

18:25.355 --> 18:28.051
- Not for fieldwork.
- What do you want my man for?

18:28.158 --> 18:30.058
To help transcribe videotapes.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.185
You oversaw the operation.

18:32.295 --> 18:34.456
If there's any clue to Kozodav's
whereabouts, we need to know.

18:45.609 --> 18:47.509
Where are you going?

18:47.611 --> 18:51.377
Every second I stay here,
Kozodav gets further away.

18:51.481 --> 18:55.918
My boss just gave you an order.
Follow it.

19:02.993 --> 19:05.723
- You got a minute?
- A building full of people's
about ready to burn down.

19:05.829 --> 19:09.560
- A minute's about all I got.
- Look, I know this church tape...

19:09.666 --> 19:12.226
is a problem for you, but /
should be the one looking for this guy.

19:12.335 --> 19:15.896
- It's O.C.U.'s case.
- Hey, we got years, Roy.

19:16.006 --> 19:19.942
Something's up. All I'm askin' is
you shoot me straight.

19:21.478 --> 19:23.776
Whatever you did to piss off
Aceveda, it worked.

19:23.914 --> 19:26.007
He's got leverage with the chief,
and he's using it.

19:26.116 --> 19:29.813
I'm keeping my nose clean.
I'm doing what I'm told. I'm delivering.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.219
Yeah, you been doing good lately,
but you got a damaged jacket.

19:33.323 --> 19:36.224
- I'm fixing that.
- Do yourself and your family a favor.

19:36.326 --> 19:39.386
Whatever you need to do
to make sure Rawling succeeds, do it.

19:39.496 --> 19:41.396
Because the shot
she's giving you...

19:41.498 --> 19:44.365
it may be the last one
you got in this department.

19:50.373 --> 19:53.206
- [Claudette] We're looking for your son.
- Darnell?

19:53.310 --> 19:56.473
- You with Child Services?
- We're with the police.

19:56.580 --> 19:59.378
There was an incident at Darnell's
foster home. He may be a witness.

19:59.483 --> 20:01.610
Whatever it was,
he probably did it.

20:01.718 --> 20:05.518
- Why do you say that?
- That boy is no good.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.819
He comes around, steals my stuff,
sells it for drug money.

20:08.925 --> 20:10.859
- Where does he score?
- All over.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.861
I can tell you
how he earns his pay.

20:12.963 --> 20:16.194
- [Claudette] He's got a job?
- Just blow jobs.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.791
He sucks fag dick
on 4th Street.

20:19.903 --> 20:21.632
Tell him I say hey.

20:21.738 --> 20:25.037
I didn't mess with Joya
or make her drink anything.

20:25.141 --> 20:28.872
We'd love to take your word for it,
but we're gonna take a D.N.A. sample...

20:28.979 --> 20:31.641
compare it with the semen we
found inside her just in case.

20:31.748 --> 20:34.114
I ain't giving you
permission for that.

20:34.217 --> 20:36.685
Frank is still technically
your legal guardian.

20:36.786 --> 20:39.687
- We have your permission?
- Of course.

20:43.894 --> 20:47.728
I may have done some shit.
But what about him?

20:47.831 --> 20:50.891
- You ain't gonna let him go free, are you?
- So you did rapeJoya?

20:51.001 --> 20:53.231
[Darnell] You see what / gotta do
on the street to survive.

20:53.336 --> 20:57.067
When am I gonna get me some?
When am I gonna get to bust a nut?

20:57.173 --> 21:01.940
- She's seven.
- I hope you fry.

21:02.045 --> 21:05.344
This is his fault-lockin'us up
in a closet and shit.

21:05.448 --> 21:09.009
A few minutes to calm you down,
you animal.

21:09.119 --> 21:11.314
- More like hours!
- Sit down.

21:13.857 --> 21:16.348
[Darnell]
He called it "the hole. '"

21:16.459 --> 21:20.395
Put the oldest one in charge
and make 'em keep order.

21:20.497 --> 21:25.127
Little ones in there cryin'
and wailin'for hours in that closet.

21:26.403 --> 21:28.462
[Sighs]

21:29.673 --> 21:31.937
And as for the Drano,
that ain't me.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.942
Sounds like Bibi
tryin' to keep the peace...

21:34.044 --> 21:36.877
so she don't get locked up
in Frank's hole.

21:41.551 --> 21:45.043
You need to get Ernesto to admit that he's
selling the cigarettes across state lines.

21:45.155 --> 21:48.215
But let him say it.
Don't get overeager, tip your hat.

21:48.325 --> 21:51.260
Don't worry about it, bro.
He thinks of me like a brother.

21:51.361 --> 21:53.261
He won't see nothin' comin'.

21:53.363 --> 21:57.265
Before I went away,
I banged his 14-year-old sister.

21:57.367 --> 22:01.133
Took her virginity. [Chuckling]
Fool didn't have a clue.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.762
/ told him / was helping her
with her history homework.

22:03.873 --> 22:05.773
Try the history
of poppin'cherries.

22:05.875 --> 22:08.105
Why don't you keep it
to yourself, man?

22:08.211 --> 22:10.111
What's the problem, superstar?

22:10.213 --> 22:12.147
If there's grass on the field,
you gotta play ball, right?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.580
- You know what, dude?
- Hey, cut it out, man!

22:14.684 --> 22:16.549
- The guy's a dick.
- Yeah, well, he's my C./.

22:16.653 --> 22:20.453
Okay, this is my run.
So just follow my orders.

22:20.557 --> 22:22.525
First one is to give him
and me a little room.

22:22.626 --> 22:24.594
Okay?

22:28.264 --> 22:30.232
All right.
Showtime, lover boy.

22:33.937 --> 22:37.429
Garcia called with
the drop point for the goods.

22:39.075 --> 22:41.236
[On Wire]
Doin' good, bro.

22:45.215 --> 22:48.343
There's more where this came
from when the smokes get to St. Louis?

22:48.451 --> 22:50.385
/ told you not to push it,
you skid mark.

22:50.487 --> 22:52.682
You should've
emphasized the point.

22:54.357 --> 22:56.951
Relax. Enough business.

22:57.060 --> 22:58.994
[Whistles]

22:59.095 --> 23:01.723
Got you a present
for all your hard work.

23:01.831 --> 23:04.595
Puta's all dressed up
with no one to blow.

23:04.701 --> 23:06.931
Mommy's gonna make papi happy.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.971
[Mutters]

23:14.878 --> 23:16.778
[Monica]
/ looked into the videotape.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.680
The woman who shot it, her nephew works
at Antwon Mitchell's rec center.

23:20.784 --> 23:24.276
You think Antwon edited the tape?
Sent it to the press?

23:24.387 --> 23:26.514
I know it's not an accurate depiction
of what happened there.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.392
Help me bury this.

23:31.494 --> 23:34.395
/ know the press.
You can't unring this bell.

23:36.533 --> 23:39.900
I'll be handing these seizure cases
over to the police committee.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.630
The rest seem fine.

23:41.738 --> 23:44.832
I also looked into
the crime stats.

of such a controversial program.

to set my sights on the policy in general.

- [Danny] That's right.

They weren't drug dealers.
They were just partying too much.

32:33.402 --> 32:35.734

38:11.640 --> 38:15.167
that a member of your organization
is acting as a criminal informant.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.113
Don't jerk me off,
man, all right?

38:20.215 --> 38:24.845
I'm willing to give you his name,
but I'm gonna need somethin' in return.

38:24.954 --> 38:29.618
- And what's that?
- You know a coyote named El Callado?

38:29.725 --> 38:32.717
I heard of him.

38:32.828 --> 38:35.262
Works for the grandejugadores.
The cartels, mostly.

38:35.364 --> 38:39.698
He's moving a Russian mobster
named Alex Kozodav out of the States.

38:39.802 --> 38:42.828
- I need to stop him.
- This coyote's not Byz Lat.

38:42.938 --> 38:45.031
I'd have to call in a lot of favors
just to get a message through.

38:45.140 --> 38:47.108
How do I know what you're telling
me is worth the shit?

38:47.209 --> 38:50.303
You get him to give me Kozodav...

38:50.412 --> 38:52.403
and I'll give you
the informant's name...

38:52.514 --> 38:54.641
and I'll make sure
that van full of cigarettes...

38:54.750 --> 38:56.775
doesn't get busted
on its way to St. Louis.

39:07.396 --> 39:10.422
- The Russian's at this address.
- Alone or with company?

39:10.532 --> 39:13.228
Alone. Just waiting
to get picked up.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.169
Who's the informant?

39:16.271 --> 39:19.104
- Hielo Gutierrez.
- No. Uh-uh.

39:20.509 --> 39:22.568
You tell me it's Hielo,
I can't believe that.

39:23.812 --> 39:26.303
He's like a brother to me,
all right?

39:26.415 --> 39:30.283
He bragged he popped
your sister's cherry when she was 14.

39:30.386 --> 39:32.946
He said it was so tight,
he thought it was her asshole.

39:33.055 --> 39:37.617
Told you he was just helping her
with some... history homework.

39:46.201 --> 39:48.795
You do whatever you feel
is appropriate with that info.

39:48.904 --> 39:52.863
- I'll make sure it doesn't blow back on you.
- [Engine Starts]

40:05.788 --> 40:08.416
- [Muffled Shouting]
- [Shouts]

40:13.762 --> 40:16.731
[Shouting]

40:18.500 --> 40:21.333
[Cocks Gun]

40:21.437 --> 40:24.133
You hired an arsonist
to torch a building.

40:24.239 --> 40:26.901
I need his name.
I need an address.

40:27.009 --> 40:29.307
What is this?
[Groaning]

40:30.579 --> 40:32.604
If the next word out of
your mouth isn't a name...

40:32.715 --> 40:34.444
I pull the trigger.

40:34.550 --> 40:37.417
Gregor, uh- Gregor Barinat.

40:37.519 --> 40:39.419
[Panting]

40:43.659 --> 40:46.594
- [Ventilator Cycling]
- [Monitor Beeping]

40:53.736 --> 40:56.500
I didn't think anybody'd be here
to look over her.

40:56.605 --> 40:59.699
- Makes two of us.
- Any changes?

41:01.143 --> 41:03.634
They say she's a little better.

41:09.384 --> 41:11.648
You think I lost it
a little bit today.

41:14.089 --> 41:16.557
We've all got burrs
under our saddle.

41:20.662 --> 41:22.755
My, uh...

41:24.633 --> 41:27.124
best friend growing up...

41:27.236 --> 41:29.796
had a father...

41:29.905 --> 41:35.673
who used to knock her around
pretty regularly.

41:35.778 --> 41:37.769
/ knew what was happening...

41:39.214 --> 41:43.014
what she was enduring,
but / couldn't-

41:49.358 --> 41:51.656
I just felt helpless.

41:53.595 --> 41:55.495
It feels worse now.

41:59.968 --> 42:03.665
If you're here to take a second shift,
I've got some, uh...

42:03.772 --> 42:07.799
seizure paperwork I've gotta prepare
for Aceveda's eyes.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.474
- [Door Closes]
- Guess who's here, Alex?

42:17.519 --> 42:19.487
It's Gregor.

42:21.623 --> 42:23.784
[Muffled Grunting]

42:29.731 --> 42:32.700
[Clanging]

42:37.372 --> 42:40.364
You were about to torch those Mexicans
in that apartment, huh?

42:40.475 --> 42:44.434
- Huh?
- [Muffled Speaking]

42:54.223 --> 42:57.386
Jesus Christ.
[Muffled Shouting]

43:01.897 --> 43:04.229
[Muffled]
Don't do it. Don't shoot.

43:08.604 --> 43:10.902
[Sighs]

43:11.006 --> 43:15.136
- [Slow Tempo]
- I'm not a great cook. I'm sorry.

43:17.112 --> 43:19.012
l- I thought it was terrific.

43:19.114 --> 43:21.207
Thanks.

43:24.152 --> 43:26.643
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:27.890 --> 43:31.382
It's, uh- It's that
little girl, Joya.

43:32.794 --> 43:34.694
I don't know. Y-Y-

43:34.796 --> 43:39.130
Dead bodies-You get used to them.
It doesn't affect you.

43:39.234 --> 43:41.225
But there's something
about a kid...

43:41.336 --> 43:43.668
hanging on, fighting.

43:43.772 --> 43:46.332
Yeah, l- I know.

43:50.345 --> 43:52.745
- [Laughing] Hey.
- Hey.

43:52.848 --> 43:54.748
You want me to read
that to you again?

43:54.850 --> 43:56.818
Come here.

43:56.919 --> 44:00.446
[Chuckling]
Oh.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.523
Big Buddy Bear.

44:04.893 --> 44:06.793
"Buddy was a big brown bear.

44:06.895 --> 44:10.456
A bumbling, stumbling,
sweet-as-honey bear."

44:10.565 --> 44:14.331
- Goddamn it!
- What's up?

44:14.436 --> 44:16.700
I've been trying to get in touch
with Hielo for the last hour.

44:16.805 --> 44:18.705
He's not answering his cell
or at home.

44:18.807 --> 44:21.139
He's probably getting laid.
If I spent five years in prison...

44:21.243 --> 44:23.404
you wouldn't get my face
out of snatch for a month.

44:23.512 --> 44:27.039
The chief already made promises to
the Bureau of Prisons to spring him early.

44:27.149 --> 44:30.243
If this guy ghosts,
I'm gonna look like an asshole.

44:30.352 --> 44:32.320
No worries. He'll show.

44:42.397 --> 44:45.594
- [Monica] Kozodav?
- And the arsonist.

44:45.701 --> 44:49.364
- How'd you track him?
- Some unis responded to a shots-fired call.

44:49.471 --> 44:53.339
These two were there when they arrived,
cuffed and gagged.

44:55.377 --> 44:57.743
I'll take it any way
I can get it.

44:57.846 --> 45:00.246
[Rock]

45:06.621 --> 45:09.920
[Man Singing]

45:21.203 --> 45:23.103
Hey.

45:29.277 --> 45:34.044
- [Continues]
- [Radio Chatter]

45:37.753 --> 45:41.917
I'm a cop, so get that light
out of my face and get out of here.

46:00.642 --> 46:03.202
