GUNS SMUGGLED INTO HONG KONG

02:37.801 --> 02:39.657
Is your wife worried about you?

02:39.797 --> 02:43.463
She's used to it, but she still prays
every time I'm on a job.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.494
Be good to her.

02:44.504 --> 02:50.364
WUEN LOI RESTAURANT

02:53.622 --> 02:55.345
Good morning. Up so early?

02:55.510 --> 02:59.246
–How many Playboys are you reading?
–I don't read the articles.

02:59.286 --> 03:00.279
Be serious.

03:00.531 --> 03:02.058
Are the “bird men” here?

03:02.098 --> 03:05.345
–Three are, but not the “bird king”.
–Keep watch.

03:27.605 --> 03:29.859
<i>Lionheart, can you hear me?</i>

03:30.377 --> 03:31.983
<i>What's happening over there?</i>

03:32.024 --> 03:33.588
<i>Something big.</i>

03:34.594 --> 03:35.787
<i>Stay alert.</i>

03:36.041 --> 03:38.029
<i>This is the real thing.</i>

03:45.842 --> 03:46.915
Sponge pudding.

03:47.971 --> 03:50.224
Have you thought about emigrating?

03:51.024 --> 03:52.348
I haven't.

03:52.590 --> 03:55.374
This is my home.
I want to be buried here.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.591
I can't adjust to life abroad.

03:58.053 --> 04:00.505
You can't get dim sum in the morning.

04:02.110 --> 04:05.623
–You can get dim sum abroad.
–We've got the original.

04:14.804 --> 04:16.882
Your son must be growing up.

04:17.776 --> 04:19.825
He's seven now.
I'll show you a photo.

04:19.865 --> 04:20.858
OK.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.840
–We've been waiting.
–We were in Shenzhen.

04:23.962 --> 04:24.842
Sit down.

04:29.064 --> 04:31.914
–I've got some good stuff.
–Is it any good?

04:31.996 --> 04:33.719
Don't pay if it's no good.

04:33.924 --> 04:35.123
I can't find it.

04:51.839 --> 04:55.087
One shot and the cops
won't know what's hit them.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.417
–Really?
–It's a bargain.

04:58.628 --> 05:02.123
The bullet can go through two
oil barrels and still kill someone.

05:02.163 --> 05:04.893
Are they really that great?

05:05.296 --> 05:07.682
<i>We have nothing but the best.</i>

05:24.698 --> 05:26.288
We'll get rich together.

05:34.097 --> 05:35.251
My treat.

05:48.438 --> 05:49.591
Freeze! Police!

05:50.125 --> 05:51.384
Stay where you are!

05:52.294 --> 05:53.127
Move!

06:12.378 --> 06:14.263
–Are you OK?
–I'm fine.

06:45.478 --> 06:46.671
Move, you bastard!

06:47.888 --> 06:48.802
Move!

06:50.057 --> 06:51.336
Get down!

07:41.554 --> 07:42.958
Old bastard!

07:52.279 --> 07:53.158
Move!

07:58.666 --> 08:00.310
Get down! Get down!

08:24.735 --> 08:25.775
Don't come in!

08:59.562 --> 09:01.207
Are you OK?

09:07.957 --> 09:09.216
Get out of the way!

10:23.796 --> 10:26.367
You're really quite something.

10:27.572 --> 10:31.019
Every time you fire a gun,
you never waste a bullet.

10:36.008 --> 10:37.797
Do you know who you killed?

10:39.542 --> 10:40.470
I'll tell you…

10:40.627 --> 10:44.352
We were investigating them
until we had enough evidence!

10:47.978 --> 10:50.497
Thanks to you,
we don't have anything!

12:49.489 --> 12:51.648
–What a pity.
–Mr Woo.

12:52.140 --> 12:55.464
–What a pity.
–What is?

12:56.037 --> 12:58.158
That we didn't catch the triads.

13:00.455 --> 13:03.985
I remember you were
so sensitive in cadet school.

13:04.472 --> 13:05.731
Now you're so hard.

13:08.328 --> 13:09.767
Did I go too far?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.161
No, they went too far.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.730
I lost a good partner.

13:20.459 --> 13:22.249
We have to make sacrifices.

14:56.905 --> 14:59.064
Long, I…

15:02.690 --> 15:05.301
Mr Hui wants to know
why you betrayed him.

15:05.341 --> 15:06.334
Long,

15:06.626 --> 15:08.715
I didn't betray Mr Hui.

15:08.750 --> 15:09.674
Yes, you did.

15:38.962 --> 15:40.951
Do you remember what happened?

15:41.413 --> 15:44.417
It happened so quickly.
It was like a dream.

15:47.719 --> 15:49.718
What's going on?

15:49.768 --> 15:52.459
He's been dead two hours.
Close range shot.

15:52.499 --> 15:53.692
Very professional.

15:54.267 --> 15:56.520
–Have you found the gun?
–Not yet.

15:56.677 --> 15:59.460
I've seen the deceased
on the wanted list.

18:08.752 --> 18:10.476
I want it in half an hour.

18:10.761 --> 18:13.651
The deceased
was a Malay Chinese terrorist.

18:14.015 --> 18:17.469
Arms dealing in Asia
and North Africa from 1978 to 1981.

18:17.509 --> 18:20.359
Wanted by
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.

18:20.361 --> 18:22.450
Joined the triads
in Hong Kong in 1985.

18:22.490 --> 18:25.605
He was Mr Hui's
right hand man in arms dealing.

18:25.623 --> 18:27.347
Bought out by Johnny Wong.

18:27.431 --> 18:30.484
The murderer used a.32 Filipino gun.

18:30.519 --> 18:31.911
His style was unique.

18:32.251 --> 18:34.330
We have no further clues.

18:36.590 --> 18:39.482
What? HK$3,000 per square foot
in Sha Tau Kok!

18:39.522 --> 18:41.007
I can't afford that!

18:43.378 --> 18:46.302
If I don't buy a flat,
Madam won't marry me!

18:48.480 --> 18:51.992
I can't get government housing
because I'm unmarried.

18:52.657 --> 18:54.505
I'm going to be on the streets.

18:54.545 --> 18:55.824
Stay at the YMCA.

18:56.272 --> 18:58.723
HK$300 for one day
and discounts for a month.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.488
That's not bad!

19:00.852 --> 19:02.499
I'll sleep at the Jazz Bar.

19:02.539 --> 19:05.190
That's perfect.
You can play before bed.

19:06.315 --> 19:09.608
Shall we investigate
who's sending flowers to Madam?

19:09.649 --> 19:12.101
–It's been happening a lot.
–So what?

19:22.704 --> 19:25.103
–Madam, flowers for you.
–Thank you.

19:52.951 --> 19:54.105
Master,

19:54.879 --> 19:56.478
please help me.

19:57.048 --> 20:00.495
Madam and I have had a few problems.
Please help me.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.614
I'd appreciate a flat, too.

20:14.562 --> 20:17.806
Have you been sick?
You've had so many flowers.

20:17.976 --> 20:19.621
I'm sick alright.

20:20.226 --> 20:21.951
Don't lose hope,

20:22.515 --> 20:24.305
we might get back together.

20:24.684 --> 20:28.396
I don't think so. I was stupid
and I've wasted my youth.

20:28.942 --> 20:30.334
You like white roses?

20:31.955 --> 20:33.682
–You didn't know?
–Have you told me?

20:33.722 --> 20:37.056
I haven't even told him!
How could he have known?

20:37.092 --> 20:37.936
The lyric.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.572
He's asking if you're lonely
and if you need a man.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.932
I just want to know how to sing it.

21:12.485 --> 21:13.612
It's not “re re”.

21:14.695 --> 21:17.060
It's “la la ti le do”.

21:17.707 --> 21:19.467
–Is that all?
–Yes.

21:22.889 --> 21:25.048
Do you want some soup? No.

21:27.308 --> 21:28.462
Your underwear.

21:35.382 --> 21:37.436
Madam likes to get white roses.

21:37.471 --> 21:38.464
Really?

21:38.957 --> 21:40.190
I just found out.

21:40.443 --> 21:43.054
If you likes them,
you should buy her some.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.818
Let's see how she behaves.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.867
What song is this?

21:55.346 --> 21:57.071
I can sing if I what.

22:26.035 --> 22:27.189
What is it, boss?

22:28.927 --> 22:30.650
Any news on the arms case?

22:32.462 --> 22:35.067
Sorry, we don't have anything yet.

22:37.684 --> 22:38.564
Keep at it.

22:48.088 --> 22:48.967
Big Guy.

22:49.373 --> 22:50.898
<i>–Come here!
–OK.</i>

22:52.627 --> 22:53.826
Have some tea.

22:55.519 --> 22:57.452
–What is it, Mr Hui?
–Eat.

22:57.487 --> 23:01.623
–We've eaten a lot already!
–You can't work if you don't eat!

23:05.160 --> 23:06.039
Hi, Long!

23:07.449 --> 23:08.329
Mr Hui.

23:10.341 --> 23:11.335
Beef jerky.

23:14.278 --> 23:15.957
You did well.

23:17.050 --> 23:19.500
–So-so.
–I left the gun there, you know!

23:19.540 --> 23:20.420
Very clever.

23:20.745 --> 23:22.310
I told him to eat more!

23:23.677 --> 23:26.522
Mr Hui treats us like children!

23:27.935 --> 23:29.740
I'm an old man…

23:30.185 --> 23:32.969
Loyalty is the most
important thing to me.

23:36.210 --> 23:37.735
Is that right or wrong?

23:38.821 --> 23:41.075
We wouldn't respect you otherwise.

23:43.682 --> 23:46.731
Long, if I did something wrong,

23:47.538 --> 23:49.062
how would you treat me?

23:50.711 --> 23:52.832
There are worse people than you.

23:53.885 --> 23:57.265
When you're free,
we'll go to Hawaii for a holiday.

23:57.901 --> 24:00.486
If you like it,
you can move out there.

24:00.834 --> 24:02.358
Leave Hong Kong behind.

24:04.248 --> 24:06.899
I do want to see out
my remaining years…

24:07.944 --> 24:11.508
but I still have
a lot of responsibilities here.

24:13.045 --> 24:13.973
I can't leave.

24:16.018 --> 24:18.139
I just want you to take it easy.

24:19.994 --> 24:21.399
–Siu!
–Morning.

24:22.485 --> 24:23.365
–Mr Hui.
–Hi.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.295
You're all dressed up.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.950
Know who's on your side.
Be careful of him.

24:29.233 --> 24:31.925
Sorry I didn't bring
anything with me.

24:31.960 --> 24:32.918
Don't worry.

24:33.933 --> 24:34.813
Long.

24:35.700 --> 24:36.854
What is it?

24:38.070 --> 24:39.955
Johnny wants to talk to you.

24:49.679 --> 24:52.451
We don't have enough arms
for South America.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.480
We'll get them somewhere else.

24:55.022 --> 24:56.907
No one's tougher than us.

24:58.155 --> 25:01.810
Don't do anything.
Let the restaurant incident die down.

25:01.851 --> 25:02.977
This way, please.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.099
Johnny, can we trust Long?

25:07.113 --> 25:08.306
It's worth a risk.

25:08.398 --> 25:11.182
We need to replace Sam
now that he's dead.

25:12.656 --> 25:14.495
Hi, Johnny. Sorry I'm late.

25:15.990 --> 25:17.909
–Johnny.
–This is Long.

25:18.199 --> 25:21.895
–You know each other already.
–We haven't had a chance to talk.

25:21.935 --> 25:22.995
I'm anti-social.

25:23.180 --> 25:24.334
Have a seat.

25:27.358 --> 25:28.957
I really admire you.

25:29.969 --> 25:32.156
–Are you happy with Mr Hui?
–Yes.

25:33.664 --> 25:35.719
You have to look to the future.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.224
You have the talent to go far.

25:40.493 --> 25:43.177
I make money wherever there's a war.

25:43.626 --> 25:47.317
Many things go out of fashion,
but not wars.

25:48.406 --> 25:50.461
You know how much money I make.

25:52.142 --> 25:54.130
We all know you're successful.

25:54.311 --> 25:55.703
Will you work for me?

25:56.440 --> 25:58.085
I'm loyal to Mr Hui.

26:00.055 --> 26:03.237
That's honourable.
That's what I like about you.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.508
I paid a fortune
to get Jimmy to work for me.

26:12.548 --> 26:14.603
He organized a big deal for me.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.583
But you killed him!

26:22.992 --> 26:26.438
I can only admire your talent.
I won't take revenge.

26:29.780 --> 26:30.775
I respect that.

26:32.632 --> 26:37.073
I came here to be your friend
but I'm not here to discuss business.

26:37.091 --> 26:39.809
Fine. You're honest.
I'll be your friend.

26:42.112 --> 26:45.824
–You got a lot of counterfeit goods.
–All thanks to you.

26:50.668 --> 26:52.633
Who did this?

26:52.918 --> 26:56.828
–Wait till I get that bastard!
–I'll kill his whole family!

27:01.996 --> 27:05.891
GANGSTERS AND POLICEMEN
DIE IN SHOOT-OUT

27:06.133 --> 27:09.378
TRIADS' ILLEGAL GUN TRADING—
SMUGGLERS SUSPECTED

27:16.457 --> 27:17.530
Stop!

27:19.630 --> 27:20.510
You bastard!

27:21.639 --> 27:23.318
Who do you think you are?

27:23.808 --> 27:25.862
–What are you doing?
–Get lost!

27:27.262 --> 27:31.192
Your men killed my partner
at the Wuen Loi Restaurant.

27:31.922 --> 27:33.201
He was my friend.

27:34.011 --> 27:36.794
Your men also killed
many innocent people.

27:37.465 --> 27:38.619
I'm onto you.

27:40.398 --> 27:42.850
I'll arrest you one day, you bastard.

27:44.736 --> 27:45.809
Remember me.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.072
Hey.

27:50.601 --> 27:51.514
Remember me.

27:56.907 --> 27:58.630
This is not the best time.

28:00.803 --> 28:01.717
Leave it.

28:40.089 --> 28:41.243
What a waste!

28:41.856 --> 28:43.314
Was it not big enough?

28:44.106 --> 28:45.712
I'm waiting for a big one.

28:45.753 --> 28:48.271
You know your stuff.
That's expensive.

28:49.046 --> 28:51.125
–How much?
–HK$100,000.

28:51.657 --> 28:54.706
The police doesn't have much money.
HK$20,000.

28:54.750 --> 28:58.044
I'm risking my life.
People are pointing guns at me.

28:58.084 --> 29:00.537
–That's not worth 100,000?
–Spare me.

29:00.776 --> 29:02.101
Take it or leave it.

29:03.989 --> 29:06.508
My mum told me
to stay away from cops.

29:07.805 --> 29:08.685
An address.

29:09.131 --> 29:11.781
Johnny is raiding
Hui's cache tonight.

29:13.108 --> 29:16.032
That bastard is ruthless. Be careful.

29:18.089 --> 29:21.601
Find me at the Jazz Bar
if you find Johnny's arsenal.

29:21.744 --> 29:22.624
OK.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.932
I put your mum into the nursing home.

29:29.095 --> 29:30.088
Thank you.

29:30.340 --> 29:31.334
Go and see her.

29:34.719 --> 29:37.237
I'll go
after I've achieved something.

29:40.101 --> 29:42.222
Hey, your money's in the bucket.

29:53.357 --> 29:55.213
Madam, more flowers for you.

30:18.021 --> 30:21.401
Call the armoury
and ask them to make preparations.

30:21.515 --> 30:24.609
–We need them for tonight.
–Shall we ask the boss?

30:24.649 --> 30:25.709
Say it's for me.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.741
Hello, armoury.

30:30.714 --> 30:33.165
My boss wants you
to prepare some guns.

30:33.205 --> 30:36.769
We'll come down later.
Don't ask so many questions.

30:56.583 --> 31:00.162
–Shall we call more people to help?
–No, it's alright.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.046
You two, go outside.

31:06.505 --> 31:09.558
Someone's stolen an officer's gun.
This is your case.

31:09.598 --> 31:11.984
Don't worry about the arms case, OK?

31:14.579 --> 31:19.218
I've been working on it for so long
and you're telling me to leave it?

31:20.644 --> 31:22.434
Can't you listen just once?

31:23.577 --> 31:25.096
Do you have to shout?

31:27.674 --> 31:28.873
Enjoying the show?

31:30.687 --> 31:32.735
This is my office.
Can't you respect me?

31:32.775 --> 31:35.700
So what?
The whole station is mine! Listen…

31:41.894 --> 31:43.862
Do you have to get so worked up?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.686
If you need a shit,
just go to the toilet!

32:10.574 --> 32:12.893
Hello? Wait a minute. It's Long.

32:14.069 --> 32:14.949
Hello?

32:15.234 --> 32:17.355
<i>I need your help tonight.</i>

32:18.166 --> 32:19.974
<i>You won't regret coming.</i>

32:20.014 --> 32:21.819
<i>OK. I'll come.</i>

32:22.866 --> 32:24.987
I'll get someone to pick you up.

33:31.234 --> 33:32.227
Hurry up.

33:51.680 --> 33:55.697
–Are we raiding my boss' cache?
–Yes, and I want you to kill him.

33:55.737 --> 33:59.448
I won't force you.
I want to know if we can be partners.

34:02.325 --> 34:04.004
I've always admired you.

34:07.185 --> 34:10.433
Either we're in this together
or you can kill me.

34:11.603 --> 34:12.483
No regrets.

34:13.773 --> 34:14.701
I have my own.

35:04.787 --> 35:05.667
It's a raid!

36:44.969 --> 36:45.849
Run!

37:14.252 --> 37:16.091
Come here!

37:16.220 --> 37:17.579
Get the guns!

37:18.751 --> 37:19.824
Hurry!

37:35.542 --> 37:36.741
Load up the car!

37:37.671 --> 37:38.550
Hurry!

37:45.905 --> 37:46.432
Long,

37:46.468 --> 37:49.073
I've done my part,
it's your turn now.

37:51.007 --> 37:54.092
You've already ruined him.
Let the old man go.

37:54.622 --> 37:56.743
Do you think he would let me go?

37:57.353 --> 37:58.233
No.

37:59.482 --> 38:02.214
In this world,
the one with the gun always wins.

38:02.254 --> 38:05.568
The old bastard is in the way.
I have to kill him.

38:05.909 --> 38:08.239
He might not
want to make money, but I do.

38:08.279 --> 38:10.730
His low prices
are pushing down the market.

38:10.770 --> 38:12.049
Don't blame me.

38:13.702 --> 38:16.950
People admire success,
not how you made it there.

38:28.364 --> 38:29.437
Load it up.

38:37.723 --> 38:39.322
It all depends on you.

38:43.508 --> 38:46.159
When Mr Hui gets here,
if you can't do it,

38:46.199 --> 38:47.478
I'll do it.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.188
You know what to do.

38:58.250 --> 38:59.403
Let's go!

40:30.638 --> 40:32.557
Don't move!

40:33.892 --> 40:35.457
Don't come any closer!

40:44.175 --> 40:45.368
Long, you traitor!

40:45.501 --> 40:47.740
How dare you? I'll kill you!

40:48.112 --> 40:49.040
Drop your gun!

40:50.803 --> 40:52.608
Drop it!

41:01.408 --> 41:02.402
Drop your guns.

41:04.099 --> 41:05.013
Drop them.

41:07.232 --> 41:08.226
Drop your guns!

41:13.258 --> 41:14.137
Long…

41:14.905 --> 41:16.495
I know I'll die tonight.

41:28.321 --> 41:29.235
Mr Hui.

41:29.807 --> 41:33.917
You've dropped your guns.
Are you giving up or are you scared?

41:34.387 --> 41:35.586
Drop them.

41:37.319 --> 41:39.604
Drop them!

41:40.131 --> 41:41.969
Drop your guns! Drop them!

41:47.241 --> 41:48.474
Johnny,

41:48.727 --> 41:50.516
it doesn't matter if I die,

41:50.655 --> 41:52.445
but will you let my men go?

41:54.110 --> 41:57.914
–Do you want them all to die?
–It's not up to me.

41:59.372 --> 42:01.161
You do what you want to do.

42:03.429 --> 42:05.668
Johnny, you're smart.

42:06.562 --> 42:08.088
I need to speak to Long.

42:08.129 --> 42:09.122
Is that OK?

42:10.418 --> 42:12.141
What's the use of talking?

42:22.951 --> 42:23.831
Long…

42:24.196 --> 42:25.429
life is like this.

42:28.896 --> 42:32.506
Sometimes you have to do things
you don't want to do.

42:37.171 --> 42:39.292
Like I want to quit but I can't.

42:40.505 --> 42:43.076
I knew this day
would come in this business.

42:43.116 --> 42:45.435
I didn't think you would betray me.

42:45.968 --> 42:49.679
I trusted the wrong person.
There's nothing left to say.

42:50.426 --> 42:52.614
I beg you, please let the men go.

42:53.560 --> 42:54.686
I'm happy to die.

42:55.849 --> 42:59.428
It's better than dying
at the hands of those bastards.

43:00.469 --> 43:02.114
Long, do as I say.

43:02.678 --> 43:04.323
–Mr Hui.
–Shoot.

43:09.788 --> 43:10.668
Shoot!

43:10.953 --> 43:11.833
Just do it!

43:12.760 --> 43:15.810
If you don't kill me, I'll kill you!

43:19.670 --> 43:21.268
–Mr Hui!
–Don't move!

43:21.517 --> 43:23.356
–Mr Hui!
–Don't move!

43:29.872 --> 43:33.162
Mr Hui! Mr Hui!

44:48.082 --> 44:49.805
–Boss…
–Kill that bastard!

45:16.360 --> 45:17.114
Kill him!

45:17.284 --> 45:18.358
You go, boss.

45:20.377 --> 45:22.982
–Let me kill him!
–It's not worth it.

45:26.363 --> 45:27.489
–Be careful.
–OK.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.045
Who is he?

50:23.814 --> 50:25.670
How come he didn't shoot me?

50:25.903 --> 50:28.289
I told you to leave this case alone.

50:28.474 --> 50:29.913
Tell me who he is!

50:32.129 --> 50:33.786
–A criminal.
–A criminal.

50:34.700 --> 50:36.539
You say he's a criminal,

50:36.588 --> 50:38.112
I hope he's a criminal.

50:39.520 --> 50:42.091
Next time I bump into him,

50:42.292 --> 50:43.571
I won't hold back.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.397
Hold on. Stay where you are!

50:50.044 --> 50:54.294
Legally, I'm not obliged
to tell you anything.

50:54.624 --> 50:56.712
But I have to tell you something.

50:56.753 --> 51:00.597
If I hadn't run out of bullets,
I would have killed a cop.

51:00.689 --> 51:02.288
You're overreacting.

51:03.662 --> 51:05.186
Back at the restaurant…

51:06.273 --> 51:07.277
you did kill a cop.

51:07.317 --> 51:08.471
Yes, I did.

51:08.723 --> 51:11.043
Cops have killed other cops before.

51:11.575 --> 51:12.614
You're wrong.

51:12.901 --> 51:16.556
You should have said, he wasn't
the first cop to sacrifice his life.

51:16.596 --> 51:17.750
Sacrifice?

51:17.922 --> 51:19.579
Is that what you call it?

51:20.854 --> 51:24.148
You better tell me who the cops are
and who the triads are…

51:24.188 --> 51:26.176
and why you want us both dead?

51:26.799 --> 51:29.609
Why do you have so many questions?

51:30.655 --> 51:31.785
You're a cop.

51:31.820 --> 51:34.869
Your job is to obey orders,
not question them!

51:35.074 --> 51:36.466
You want to know why?

51:37.082 --> 51:38.739
You can't always ask why.

51:39.774 --> 51:42.955
Why do we need search warrants
and triads don't?

51:43.670 --> 51:47.807
Why do we have to write reports when
we use a gun and the triads don't?

51:47.848 --> 51:50.830
Why are suspects innocent
until proven guilty

51:50.860 --> 51:54.355
and why does the burden of proof
lie on us, not on them?

51:54.395 --> 51:55.834
Why?

51:56.082 --> 51:58.251
If I knew that, I'd be in your place.

51:58.292 --> 51:59.525
Alright?

52:00.782 --> 52:03.101
I'll say this.

52:03.232 --> 52:05.964
I lost my friend, Lung,
at the restaurant.

52:06.004 --> 52:08.053
I don't care whether I die or not…

52:08.093 --> 52:11.009
but I swear I'll arrest
that bastard Johnny.

52:11.949 --> 52:14.640
God help anybody
that tries to stop me.

52:14.676 --> 52:15.520
Stop!

52:21.027 --> 52:24.591
If something bad happens
because of you…

52:25.968 --> 52:28.288
it won't be enough for you to quit.

52:28.780 --> 52:30.013
I'm shaking!

52:31.632 --> 52:34.685
That's a cop's life for you.
You're never good enough.

52:34.725 --> 52:37.537
I asked myself
if I should do the right thing.

52:37.577 --> 52:41.421
But every time I read the newspaper,
I felt uncomfortable.

52:41.594 --> 52:43.582
I felt I had a responsibility.

52:44.606 --> 52:47.228
After the job,
I forgot about being shouted at.

52:47.269 --> 52:50.069
–And if you didn't solve a case?
–I was suicidal.

52:50.110 --> 52:51.708
–That bad?
–Yes.

52:52.118 --> 52:56.255
You should have given me a better
drawing. It turns out I know him.

52:56.296 --> 52:57.983
He lives at Clearwater Bay.

52:58.023 --> 53:00.148
How can I thank you?

53:00.835 --> 53:02.227
With better drawings.

53:05.253 --> 53:06.006
So?

53:06.338 --> 53:10.513
If Superintendent Pang says he's
a triad, then he's undercover.

53:11.198 --> 53:13.037
If you speak to him,

53:13.367 --> 53:17.218
tell him there's no need
to get killed to solve a case.

53:23.008 --> 53:27.304
–Have you got a cop called Vodka?
–He's called Tequila.

53:27.427 --> 53:28.946
He's a tough cop.

53:30.439 --> 53:33.422
I don't care who he is.
Tell him to back off.

53:33.532 --> 53:36.182
He'll ruin everything.

53:36.465 --> 53:38.917
Do you want to go to another funeral?

53:39.076 --> 53:40.229
Don't worry,

53:40.682 --> 53:41.836
I'll stop him.

53:42.852 --> 53:44.707
And get that export license.

53:44.860 --> 53:47.776
I need that shipment
to find Johnny's cache.

53:49.439 --> 53:50.632
Give me a day, OK?

53:50.966 --> 53:52.804
I'll deal with customs.

53:53.215 --> 53:55.706
–Wait for my call.
–And my Swiss bank account?

53:55.746 --> 53:56.625
It's sorted.

53:56.830 --> 53:58.638
What about the house in Guam?

53:58.678 --> 54:00.438
Does it have a garden?

54:00.486 --> 54:02.010
Don't bother with that.

54:02.092 --> 54:04.479
If it's too dangerous, you can quit.

54:04.944 --> 54:08.029
I'll hold you to that.

54:11.572 --> 54:13.296
I knew you'd be like this.

54:14.103 --> 54:16.224
You know I always do a good job.

54:19.365 --> 54:22.083
It's your birthday today.
Did you forget?

54:24.105 --> 54:24.985
It's for you.

54:27.640 --> 54:28.760
I had forgotten.

54:29.729 --> 54:33.904
Birthdays aren't important
when you don't have a real identity.

54:34.670 --> 54:36.923
Only you know when my birthday is.

54:39.932 --> 54:41.496
Don't you forget it.

55:29.299 --> 55:32.812
What? You're still upset
and you want to get revenge?

55:46.130 --> 55:49.046
What are you?
It's hard to call you a triad.

55:49.545 --> 55:51.864
It's even harder to call you a cop.

55:52.156 --> 55:53.595
What rank are you?

55:54.043 --> 55:55.448
Sergeant?

55:55.771 --> 55:57.095
Inspector? Joker?

55:58.342 --> 55:59.667
Should I salute you?

56:00.149 --> 56:01.348
If you like.

56:01.515 --> 56:03.039
To you, I'm a criminal.

56:03.523 --> 56:04.915
To my mum, I'm a son.

56:05.090 --> 56:06.813
To the triads, I'm a boss.

56:10.031 --> 56:13.001
–Should I salute you?
–You've got the gun.

56:13.726 --> 56:16.046
I'll go and milk a cow if you want.

56:16.659 --> 56:18.658
Sorry, I don't drink milk.

56:24.853 --> 56:27.305
Why do you have so many paper cranes?

56:28.026 --> 56:30.026
Are you lonely?

56:30.597 --> 56:32.916
Do they keep you company?

56:36.141 --> 56:38.129
I've always hated making them.

56:40.117 --> 56:42.503
I make one each time I kill someone.

56:43.933 --> 56:45.060
Do you like them?

56:45.259 --> 56:46.384
I'll make you one.

56:46.424 --> 56:47.497
Thank you.

56:51.325 --> 56:53.512
Who will make yours when you die?

56:56.185 --> 56:57.864
Let's team up

56:58.113 --> 57:00.035
and make one for Johnny Wong.

57:01.447 --> 57:02.692
You make it yourself.

57:02.733 --> 57:03.966
I don't have time.

57:04.661 --> 57:05.986
I'm meeting someone.

57:09.762 --> 57:11.817
I hate going to cops' funerals.

57:14.181 --> 57:16.036
Every time a colleague dies…

57:17.796 --> 57:19.320
I play a song for them.

57:19.603 --> 57:22.520
I don't want to have
to play a song for you.

58:54.322 --> 58:56.081
Go! Johnny Wong's coming!

58:57.495 --> 59:00.147
–How do I get in touch?
–I'll send you a crane.

59:00.187 --> 59:02.186
Take care, mate.

59:05.810 --> 59:07.044
You traitor.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.450
And that cop…

59:09.787 --> 59:11.706
Check the place.

59:13.603 --> 59:15.525
I've been after this bastard!

59:17.901 --> 59:22.011
I'll keep an eye out for you.
No one will dare to make a move.

59:23.645 --> 59:25.037
Take him to hospital!

59:31.920 --> 59:35.214
<i>This is my hospital.
You'll get 24 hour protection.</i>

59:35.254 --> 59:39.231
<i>–I'll be alright.
–Don't worry. It's best to be safe.</i>

59:42.444 --> 59:43.324
Thank you.

59:47.988 --> 59:50.147
Nurse! Nurse! Nurse!

59:50.478 --> 59:53.129
–When did he get hurt?
–At the building site.

59:53.170 --> 59:54.849
Can you get a doctor?

59:55.419 --> 59:58.184
They'll take care of you first.

01:00:27.112 --> 01:00:29.167
–Is it our turn yet?
–Sit down!

01:00:29.362 --> 01:00:30.886
It's not your turn yet!

01:00:32.294 --> 01:00:35.608
–This is a deep wound.
–Nurse, can I speak to you?

01:00:38.561 --> 01:00:40.288
I don't want any record of this.

01:00:40.328 --> 01:00:42.847
I don't want
anyone to know he's here.

01:00:44.184 --> 01:00:45.775
<i>Siu betrayed you.</i>

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.563
He gave your address to Hui's men.

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.088
I'll deal with him.

01:00:50.732 --> 01:00:53.102
–I can handle it.
–Wait until you're better.

01:00:53.142 --> 01:00:55.106
I'll sort him out.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.990
Are you sure it was Siu?

01:01:18.248 --> 01:01:21.698
He's been working for the cops
while working for me.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.532
He told me where Hui's cache was.

01:01:28.129 --> 01:01:29.122
Bastard!

01:01:32.628 --> 01:01:35.199
He must know
where your firearms are.

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:39.985
How could you tell him so much?

01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:43.341
I have to kill
that two-faced bastard!

01:01:48.495 --> 01:01:49.375
Let me do it.

01:02:21.514 --> 01:02:23.635
How much have you told the cops?

01:02:26.535 --> 01:02:30.379
There's no point killing me,
I haven't told them anything.

01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:35.888
You bastard!

01:02:36.296 --> 01:02:37.176
Stop lying!

01:02:39.148 --> 01:02:41.913
How come they knew about the raid?

01:02:46.619 --> 01:02:47.499
Why me?

01:02:48.909 --> 01:02:51.600
It's all about money these days,
not loyalty.

01:02:51.641 --> 01:02:52.834
Who can you trust?

01:03:01.763 --> 01:03:03.852
<i>Mr Woo, I have a good friend.</i>

01:03:03.892 --> 01:03:06.222
It's doesn't matter
if he's good or bad.

01:03:06.262 --> 01:03:08.449
We're both in serious danger now.

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:11.153
If you were me, would you save him?

01:03:11.203 --> 01:03:14.450
If he was my friend,
I would definitely save him,

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.113
whether he's good or bad.

01:03:16.385 --> 01:03:19.629
If I was a cop,
I would still save him.

01:03:20.843 --> 01:03:24.157
–Then you're a martyr.
–Not me. It's Him up there.

01:03:28.154 --> 01:03:29.753
Siu! Siu!

01:03:31.006 --> 01:03:34.697
–What happened?
–Are you OK?

01:03:35.826 --> 01:03:38.345
–Johnny's arsenal is at…
–Where is it?

01:03:38.879 --> 01:03:42.489
–It's at the Maple Hospital.
–Maple?

01:03:44.222 --> 01:03:45.101
Siu!

01:03:45.266 --> 01:03:48.779
Can you ask my girlfriend
to meet me at the hospital?

01:04:25.033 --> 01:04:26.293
Who brought him in?

01:04:26.399 --> 01:04:27.526
I brought him in.

01:04:28.287 --> 01:04:32.662
I'm Inspector Yuen, CID. I'll
register him later. I'm responsible.

01:04:51.224 --> 01:04:52.103
Hold on.

01:04:55.763 --> 01:04:56.756
Sorry.

01:05:01.467 --> 01:05:03.588
–How's his blood pressure?
–Low.

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:05.158
80/50.

01:05:05.805 --> 01:05:07.130
And his pupils?

01:05:11.469 --> 01:05:13.228
Somewhat dilated.

01:05:13.999 --> 01:05:15.446
Nurse, give him some oxygen.

01:05:15.486 --> 01:05:18.257
<i>Boss, that cop took Siu to hospital.</i>

01:05:18.298 --> 01:05:19.862
What's happened?

01:05:20.627 --> 01:05:23.680
Siu's still alive.
That cop took him to hospital.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.913
He'll grass us up.

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:27.707
–I'll sort him out.
–You?

01:05:28.139 --> 01:05:30.348
Don't worry, I'll kill him this time.

01:05:30.388 --> 01:05:31.648
Kill that cop, too.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.417
<i>I'm not convinced.</i>

01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:46.510
Send some extra men

01:05:46.577 --> 01:05:47.490
to help him.

01:05:50.433 --> 01:05:53.680
This patient is my witness.
How is his condition?

01:05:53.807 --> 01:05:56.338
Luckily,
the lighter stopped the bullet.

01:05:56.378 --> 01:05:58.499
–Can he talk?
–He needs to rest.

01:06:44.822 --> 01:06:46.147
How are you feeling?

01:06:47.633 --> 01:06:49.359
–Cig…
–What?

01:06:49.521 --> 01:06:50.675
Cigarette.

01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:53.735
The oxygen might explode.

01:06:55.707 --> 01:06:57.592
Turn it off. Turn it off.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.642
You're half dead and smoking?

01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:02.248
I'm screwed.

01:07:02.978 --> 01:07:06.508
I want to prove
I was one of the best before I die.

01:07:08.079 --> 01:07:09.964
You've proved it already.

01:07:15.511 --> 01:07:17.109
You've done it.

01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:23.906
<i>I found that Johnny's arsenal
is in this hospital's basement.</i>

01:07:23.946 --> 01:07:25.751
Wasn't I smart this time?

01:07:30.172 --> 01:07:33.288
If I solve this case,
I'll pay you the old fee.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.007
I won't live to spend it.

01:07:42.223 --> 01:07:44.675
It's up to you to put on a good show.

01:07:46.883 --> 01:07:48.587
Come on now.

01:07:48.622 --> 01:07:50.291
Don't smoke.

01:07:53.952 --> 01:07:55.186
Get some rest.

01:07:55.961 --> 01:07:57.618
–Who's been smoking?
–Me.

01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:00.049
It's dangerous.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.187
–That's why I put it out.
–Don't do it again.

01:08:02.227 --> 01:08:03.872
Time for your injection.

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:09.611
Hey, don't let her inject me.
They might try to kill me.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.392
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on you.

01:08:13.515 --> 01:08:15.437
The man outside gave me this.

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:30.022
–Where are you taking me?
–To a safe place.

01:08:34.121 --> 01:08:36.166
I have a colleague here.

01:08:36.451 --> 01:08:38.572
–Which room is he in?
–Room 301.

01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:36.665
White roses again.
Was there nothing else?

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:37.984
What's the problem?

01:09:39.798 --> 01:09:41.564
You're a bad undercover cop.

01:09:41.604 --> 01:09:43.444
It's a matter of taste.

01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:49.386
White roses every time.
Even my mum knows what's going on.

01:09:49.559 --> 01:09:50.439
Where's Siu?

01:09:50.684 --> 01:09:51.403
Next door.

01:09:52.009 --> 01:09:55.124
–Do you know where the firearms are?
–I forgot!

01:09:57.553 --> 01:09:59.276
I don't have time to joke.

01:10:00.605 --> 01:10:02.170
Neither do I.

01:10:09.402 --> 01:10:11.081
Where are the firearms?

01:10:18.641 --> 01:10:22.979
I let Siu go so he could find you.
I've worked hard these five years.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.699
The police are after me.

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:28.187
I'm always worried
about getting exposed.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:29.983
I'm forced to kill.

01:10:30.812 --> 01:10:34.524
I don't care about dying,
I just want to solve the case.

01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:35.874
And you're joking with me?

01:10:35.914 --> 01:10:37.571
I don't know how to joke.

01:10:45.715 --> 01:10:48.366
So what
if you manage to solve the case?

01:10:49.652 --> 01:10:52.624
The police will give you money
and a passport,

01:10:52.664 --> 01:10:54.263
but where will you go?

01:10:54.753 --> 01:10:55.958
Where are you going?

01:10:55.998 --> 01:10:57.589
You've got an operation.

01:11:05.639 --> 01:11:07.078
If you die,

01:11:07.728 --> 01:11:10.114
they won't give you a grand funeral.

01:11:16.003 --> 01:11:17.236
I know that.

01:11:17.931 --> 01:11:19.769
That's fine, then. Come on.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.907
–What's going on?
–Nothing.

01:11:59.947 --> 01:12:01.021
Walk that way.

01:12:08.785 --> 01:12:11.237
–Look out for anyone suspicious.
–OK.

01:12:16.618 --> 01:12:17.897
Be careful.

01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:27.095
Let's go back up.
My colleague is coming.

01:12:57.911 --> 01:13:00.231
–Tequila!
–Have you been here long?

01:13:00.321 --> 01:13:01.515
Let's talk inside.

01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:03.722
Do you have any news?

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.724
The morgue has steel reinforcements.

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:10.079
<i>It took almost four months
to build it.</i>

01:13:12.252 --> 01:13:15.102
–Siu said that before he died.
–Siu's dead?

01:13:17.313 --> 01:13:18.307
I was too late.

01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:23.294
I forgot to introduce you.

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:25.387
She's my girlfriend, Teresa Chang.

01:13:25.427 --> 01:13:27.747
You've been sending flowers to her.

01:13:31.452 --> 01:13:33.905
–The flowers were lovely.
–Thank you.

01:13:35.228 --> 01:13:36.753
I picked them randomly.

01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:42.001
–She doesn't like them.
–I want to get more.

01:13:42.338 --> 01:13:44.748
–Are you not getting on?
–Not really.

01:13:44.789 --> 01:13:48.433
Couples argue all the time.
We'll be alright.

01:13:50.452 --> 01:13:54.694
Call the Superintendent. Ask him
to come here. Wait for me here.

01:13:55.996 --> 01:13:58.366
–How will we signal her?
–With flowers.

01:13:58.406 --> 01:13:59.891
–Flowers?
–Yes.

01:14:00.173 --> 01:14:01.565
You, send me flowers?

01:14:02.383 --> 01:14:03.662
I taught him.

01:14:04.672 --> 01:14:06.031
I just picked it up.

01:14:06.199 --> 01:14:07.078
Thank you.

01:14:10.818 --> 01:14:12.740
I'll send them in 30 minutes.

01:14:14.032 --> 01:14:16.482
You're smart enough
to know what to do.

01:14:16.522 --> 01:14:18.201
Shall we go?

01:14:27.609 --> 01:14:28.488
B2.

01:14:29.818 --> 01:14:32.933
Superintendent,
can you come to Maple hospital?

01:14:35.602 --> 01:14:37.041
–Are you new?
–Yes.

01:14:37.731 --> 01:14:39.659
–What's your name?
–Ng Yue Lum.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.815
–I'd like to see a doctor.
–What's the problem?

01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:43.793
Fever.

01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:48.408
Who have you got there?

01:14:48.738 --> 01:14:52.383
Don't look, he died horribly
with his guts hanging out.

01:14:52.795 --> 01:14:54.119
Massive bleeding.

01:15:09.786 --> 01:15:15.122
–Wasn't my timing perfect?
–Not bad. Theirs was better.

01:15:23.765 --> 01:15:25.687
Teresa Chang, it's your turn.

01:15:26.778 --> 01:15:28.700
Let another patient go first.

01:15:31.477 --> 01:15:33.598
It's OK, I'm feeling better now.

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:39.704
–You should see a doctor.
–I don't want to!

01:15:40.716 --> 01:15:43.036
Stay calm. Don't forget we're cops.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.538
<i>Where are they?</i>

01:15:53.771 --> 01:15:54.970
In the morgue.

01:16:07.589 --> 01:16:09.589
Look, these four are empty.

01:16:10.923 --> 01:16:12.728
J 1, 2, 3, 4.

01:16:42.255 --> 01:16:45.437
Are you crazy?
How are we going to get back out?

01:16:46.232 --> 01:16:48.419
I've got no intention of leaving.

01:16:49.566 --> 01:16:52.250
How's Long? Has his cover been blown?

01:16:53.262 --> 01:16:55.066
Everything depends on him.

01:16:55.591 --> 01:17:00.496
<i>I hope it's not too dangerous in
the morgue. May God keep him safe.</i>

01:17:00.733 --> 01:17:04.107
Tequila's there too.
You haven't even mentioned him!

01:17:04.147 --> 01:17:06.112
<i>He's in danger tool</i>

01:17:06.919 --> 01:17:10.299
You're so biased!
You're always having a go at him.

01:17:10.374 --> 01:17:13.025
You don't understand
nor care about him.

01:17:15.997 --> 01:17:18.648
<i>I didn't realize you still cared.</i>

01:17:23.388 --> 01:17:26.473
Really.

01:17:27.044 --> 01:17:29.534
–What did he say?
–He said to wait for his signal.

01:17:29.574 --> 01:17:32.822
When I get the flowers,
we evacuate the patients.

01:18:05.686 --> 01:18:08.851
How come
you can't even open a door?

01:18:10.466 --> 01:18:12.256
Why don't you try? Open it.

01:18:15.568 --> 01:18:19.279
What are you complaining about then?
You're not helping!

01:18:19.826 --> 01:18:21.615
This is not even your case!

01:18:24.606 --> 01:18:28.216
It's not my case?

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:32.415
I got this far. I think
it has everything to do with me.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.809
If all cops were as selfish as you,

01:18:34.849 --> 01:18:36.440
Hong Kong would be dead.

01:18:38.906 --> 01:18:40.497
Don't take it out on me.

01:18:41.557 --> 01:18:42.949
Let me open the door.

01:20:02.859 --> 01:20:06.173
Which year did you graduate?
Who was your teacher?

01:20:07.639 --> 01:20:09.204
Are you testing me?

01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:12.529
I'd just like to ask your teacher

01:20:13.584 --> 01:20:16.633
how he managed to produce
such a stubborn cop.

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:21.462
Pang said you don't waste bullets.

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.825
Are you testing me?

01:22:09.352 --> 01:22:10.279
What the hell!

01:24:05.922 --> 01:24:08.453
We killed Siu
but Long and that cop have gone.

01:24:08.493 --> 01:24:09.978
Call all units now.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:11.253
Sir…

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:12.964
Evacuate the patients!

01:24:14.157 --> 01:24:16.042
I found it in my pocket.

01:24:16.366 --> 01:24:17.246
Get the team.

01:24:55.732 --> 01:24:58.979
They're in the basement.
Sorry, it was our fault.

01:25:29.554 --> 01:25:32.072
There are
two groups of people I hate…

01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:36.174
cops and those
who kill their bosses.

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:40.556
You bastard.

01:25:41.605 --> 01:25:43.527
If your information is wrong,

01:25:43.774 --> 01:25:46.505
it'll cause panic
and patients could be hurt.

01:25:46.545 --> 01:25:48.112
–Who's responsible?
–I am.

01:25:48.152 --> 01:25:51.797
I'm in charge here.
The patients are my responsibility.

01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:55.698
I won't evacuate
unless there's a serious threat.

01:26:08.116 --> 01:26:09.475
What's going on?

01:26:10.245 --> 01:26:11.810
Calm down!

01:26:12.374 --> 01:26:13.766
Return to your rooms!

01:26:14.543 --> 01:26:18.454
Doctor, don't you have to evacuate
if there's a fire alarm?

01:26:33.623 --> 01:26:35.148
You said it was secure!

01:26:36.636 --> 01:26:38.359
–Turn the coolant on.
–OK.

01:27:19.938 --> 01:27:21.698
We can't fail now.

01:27:23.594 --> 01:27:24.793
We have no choice.

01:27:24.879 --> 01:27:27.651
We don't have much time.
We have to move them.

01:27:27.691 --> 01:27:29.130
That bastard.

01:27:31.386 --> 01:27:34.471
It's all up to me.
No one can challenge me.

01:27:34.801 --> 01:27:36.789
–What?
–Evacuate the patients!

01:27:37.894 --> 01:27:39.698
Over there!

01:27:39.902 --> 01:27:41.027
It's just a drill.

01:27:41.067 --> 01:27:42.592
It's just a fire drill.

01:27:43.517 --> 01:27:45.836
It's OK. Everyone stay calm.

01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:47.981
It's OK.

01:27:48.016 --> 01:27:49.276
It's a false alarm!

01:27:49.422 --> 01:27:51.150
Everyone back to your rooms.

01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:53.576
Are you crazy? Don't get in our way!

01:27:54.564 --> 01:27:56.883
I'll arrest you!

01:27:57.376 --> 01:28:01.949
–I'll sue you for abuse of power.
–There are 300 lives at stake here.

01:28:02.035 --> 01:28:02.963
I'll kill you!

01:28:03.522 --> 01:28:04.880
Be careful.

01:28:09.627 --> 01:28:10.781
Quickly!

01:28:11.555 --> 01:28:14.671
–Why don't you take them out?
–Everyone's gone.

01:28:15.211 --> 01:28:16.365
Get some help!

01:28:25.534 --> 01:28:27.324
Boss, all the men are here.

01:28:35.657 --> 01:28:36.784
We must evacuate!

01:28:37.143 --> 01:28:38.502
–Doctor?
–Carry on!

01:28:38.991 --> 01:28:40.913
The cops are up to something.

01:28:45.297 --> 01:28:47.352
–Cut the mains. Stop them.
–OK.

01:28:57.710 --> 01:28:58.749
Get the babies!

01:29:03.735 --> 01:29:05.988
<i>–They're shooting!
–I know.</i>

01:29:11.407 --> 01:29:14.854
–You've caused all this!
–Take care of the patients!

01:29:15.424 --> 01:29:16.863
Doctor! Doctor!

01:29:25.386 --> 01:29:27.836
Stop! I'll shoot!
Come back! Come back!

01:29:27.877 --> 01:29:29.396
Get out!

01:29:30.247 --> 01:29:31.307
Did you hear me?

01:29:33.741 --> 01:29:34.621
It's OK, CID!

01:29:34.826 --> 01:29:36.345
Come back!

01:29:41.052 --> 01:29:42.510
Police! Drop your gun!

01:30:05.635 --> 01:30:07.624
The police have us surrounded.

01:30:15.838 --> 01:30:18.043
Take the patients hostage.

01:30:20.297 --> 01:30:23.752
They're just ordinary people
underneath their uniforms.

01:30:23.792 --> 01:30:25.951
They've got guns, so have we.

01:30:27.568 --> 01:30:29.026
They've only got .38s.

01:30:40.623 --> 01:30:41.502
Hurry!

01:30:52.673 --> 01:30:54.078
Get down!

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.594
Don't move!

01:31:08.821 --> 01:31:10.107
Get out!
Put the babies down! Get out!

01:31:10.147 --> 01:31:11.472
Put the babies down!

01:31:11.954 --> 01:31:12.708
Hurry!

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.685
Did you hear me?

01:31:18.221 --> 01:31:20.699
Lower your voice!
You'll scare them.

01:31:27.861 --> 01:31:29.940
Be good. Don't be scared.

01:31:51.963 --> 01:31:54.568
Now he wants to blow up the hospital.

01:31:55.056 --> 01:31:58.028
–How will you send the flowers?
–I already did.

01:31:58.068 --> 01:31:59.268
Telepathy?

01:32:00.077 --> 01:32:03.457
She doesn't realize
that I go through hell for her.

01:32:11.164 --> 01:32:13.019
Do you think you can escape?

01:32:16.586 --> 01:32:18.231
Long…

01:32:18.515 --> 01:32:19.508
I admired you.

01:32:20.322 --> 01:32:22.009
<i>I treated you as a friend.</i>

01:32:22.049 --> 01:32:24.219
<i>I never imagined you'd betray me.</i>

01:32:24.259 --> 01:32:25.452
You disappoint me.

01:32:26.227 --> 01:32:29.475
You'll be even more disappointed
when I kill you.

01:32:29.561 --> 01:32:30.967
<i>I've been after you.</i>

01:32:31.007 --> 01:32:34.180
Why the hospital?
Do you like killing the innocent?

01:32:34.221 --> 01:32:37.336
I like the risk.
I've got hundreds of hostages.

01:32:38.197 --> 01:32:40.125
<i>I've got an arms cache down there.</i>

01:32:40.166 --> 01:32:43.056
I'll detonate it
if you make me angry.

01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:45.939
–Try it.
–I mean it.

01:32:46.472 --> 01:32:49.717
My next arsenal
will be in a police station.

01:32:51.252 --> 01:32:52.246
That'll be fun.

01:32:57.237 --> 01:33:00.210
There are over 100 patients
being held hostage.

01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:02.172
The police haven't been able-

01:33:08.404 --> 01:33:09.929
–I'm scared!
–Get down!

01:33:32.466 --> 01:33:34.191
Unit 3… No filming!

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:42.592
The wall's cold.
The morgue must be on the other side.

01:33:43.392 --> 01:33:45.551
Good, that's handy.

01:33:47.007 --> 01:33:49.128
Just leave me in there if I die.

01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:56.600
There are two of us here.
There's no time for self-pity.

01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:59.258
I wanted to protect the innocent.

01:33:59.299 --> 01:34:02.016
<i>But I've had to kill them as well.</i>

01:34:04.159 --> 01:34:06.081
I wanted to be a regular cop.

01:34:07.573 --> 01:34:09.562
There were no other positions.

01:34:10.345 --> 01:34:12.344
Undercover in the triads.

01:34:12.675 --> 01:34:14.594
Keep quiet.

01:34:15.929 --> 01:34:17.983
–Do you have any dreams?
–I do.

01:34:19.704 --> 01:34:21.626
I want to move to Antarctica.

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:24.720
It's freezing there. You like that?

01:34:25.167 --> 01:34:27.337
At least I can come out of the dark.

01:34:27.377 --> 01:34:30.301
There's daylight
24 hours a day there.

01:34:36.013 --> 01:34:39.261
You can't just talk about it.
I have dreams, too.

01:34:39.267 --> 01:34:42.183
I wanted to be in a band
but I became a cop.

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:47.783
All you can do is laugh. Come on.

01:35:26.867 --> 01:35:27.906
Don't move!

01:35:36.909 --> 01:35:37.983
The guy's a cop.

01:35:50.607 --> 01:35:52.171
Johnny, you're winning.

01:35:52.696 --> 01:35:56.606
Why not let the patients go?
It's just us against the cops.

01:35:56.954 --> 01:35:57.948
Are you scared?

01:35:58.962 --> 01:36:00.036
I'm not scared.

01:36:00.328 --> 01:36:04.901
I've been around a long time so
I know when things have gone too far.

01:36:05.228 --> 01:36:06.587
I don't care.

01:36:40.858 --> 01:36:42.663
Stop!

01:36:47.888 --> 01:36:49.695
–Don't move!
–Go and have a look!

01:36:49.736 --> 01:36:50.650
Don't move!

01:36:51.061 --> 01:36:53.139
Get down!

01:37:08.977 --> 01:37:10.541
I've got the cop!

01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.174
Bring him here!

01:37:20.425 --> 01:37:21.704
Go!

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:41.707
Police! Get down!

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:43.271
Get down!

01:38:11.038 --> 01:38:12.957
Go!

01:38:18.549 --> 01:38:19.543
Go!

01:38:19.714 --> 01:38:20.913
Help the patients!

01:38:29.154 --> 01:38:31.153
Hurry!

01:38:38.714 --> 01:38:40.437
I have to save the babies!

01:38:40.562 --> 01:38:41.689
I'll go with you.

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:59.522
–There's so many of them.
–Quiet! You'll wake them.

01:38:59.562 --> 01:39:02.942
–Put cotton wool in their ears.
–Is that necessary?

01:39:33.947 --> 01:39:35.545
Be careful! I'm a cop!

01:39:35.995 --> 01:39:38.315
Do you want as many babies as this?

01:39:38.767 --> 01:39:39.960
I'm not a machine!

01:39:42.864 --> 01:39:43.744
Smile.

01:39:43.989 --> 01:39:45.381
–Are you ready?
–Yes.

01:39:53.027 --> 01:39:54.021
Inspector Yuen.

01:39:55.799 --> 01:39:57.079
Help Madam. Get the babies out.

01:39:57.119 --> 01:39:57.964
Over there.

01:39:58.088 --> 01:39:59.081
Be careful.

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:04.905
I'm going to help Long.
You're in charge here. Be careful.

01:40:26.729 --> 01:40:28.008
Upstairs.

01:40:32.272 --> 01:40:34.157
Madam, the exit's blocked!

01:40:36.128 --> 01:40:37.853
He's one of us!

01:40:44.082 --> 01:40:45.236
Get the babies!

01:40:48.018 --> 01:40:50.471
–Take the curtains down.
–Yes, Madam.

01:41:01.234 --> 01:41:02.227
Be careful.

01:41:12.963 --> 01:41:13.797
Help!

01:41:16.418 --> 01:41:19.003
–I'm dropping the baby!
–Pass it to me!

01:41:22.845 --> 01:41:25.430
–Over there.
–Put them in a safe place.

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.899
Mun! It's OK! Mun!

01:42:12.172 --> 01:42:13.531
Did you get shot?

01:42:14.382 --> 01:42:15.906
–Can you hold on?
–Yes.

01:42:50.775 --> 01:42:52.054
Go!

01:43:04.071 --> 01:43:05.590
I just killed a cop.

01:43:07.726 --> 01:43:08.606
No…

01:43:10.297 --> 01:43:12.185
–I'm sure he was a cop.
–He wasn't!

01:43:12.225 --> 01:43:13.550
He had a badge!

01:43:14.956 --> 01:43:16.555
You were hallucinating!

01:43:17.166 --> 01:43:20.540
How many times do I have to say it?
He wasn't a cop!

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:22.147
You're your own worst enemy.

01:43:22.187 --> 01:43:26.296
If you can't conquer your fears,
how can you beat anyone else?

01:43:29.016 --> 01:43:29.929
Take this!

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:54.884
I killed a cop
in the course of this investigation.

01:43:54.925 --> 01:43:56.078
Pang told me.

01:43:57.174 --> 01:43:59.459
I didn't realize until afterwards.

01:43:59.986 --> 01:44:01.113
How did you feel?

01:44:01.271 --> 01:44:02.862
Worse than you did then.

01:44:04.003 --> 01:44:06.124
–Then he really was a cop?
–Yes!

01:44:06.453 --> 01:44:07.527
Shit!

01:44:51.523 --> 01:44:53.047
Go and save the babies!

01:45:32.214 --> 01:45:33.539
Be careful.

01:45:39.244 --> 01:45:41.033
–Catch!
–OK, pass it to me!

01:45:42.015 --> 01:45:43.008
No reaction.

01:45:44.586 --> 01:45:45.865
Whose baby is this?

01:46:04.831 --> 01:46:05.711
Go and help!

01:46:06.639 --> 01:46:07.567
Pass it to me!

01:46:09.009 --> 01:46:10.002
Catch!

01:46:24.393 --> 01:46:25.958
Is this your baby?

01:46:28.531 --> 01:46:29.658
Someone's coming!

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:47.439
You bitch!

01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:57.292
We need help up here
to save the babies!

01:47:00.987 --> 01:47:02.795
–I'll go.
–I'll deal with him.

01:47:02.835 --> 01:47:03.669
Be careful.

01:47:08.138 --> 01:47:10.524
Don't be scared. We'll hide in here.

01:47:38.345 --> 01:47:39.224
Quickly!

01:47:54.332 --> 01:47:55.106
Careful.

01:47:56.099 --> 01:47:57.458
Go quickly.

01:47:59.594 --> 01:48:01.251
I left one of the babies!

01:48:01.442 --> 01:48:02.515
OK, I'll get it.

01:48:03.008 --> 01:48:04.930
–Look after her.
–Be careful!

01:48:06.463 --> 01:48:08.716
Put these all around the hospital.

01:48:30.002 --> 01:48:31.156
Madam, hold on!

01:48:43.298 --> 01:48:44.497
Quiet now.

01:48:44.664 --> 01:48:45.923
Quiet now. Be good.

01:48:52.256 --> 01:48:53.135
Be quiet!

01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:57.447
Be good. I'll rap to you.

01:49:18.446 --> 01:49:19.705
I know I can't rap…

01:49:20.575 --> 01:49:22.574
so you don't have to pretend.

01:49:30.416 --> 01:49:32.176
Don't watch.

01:49:54.638 --> 01:49:55.963
Baby…

01:50:06.207 --> 01:50:07.280
Sorry.

01:50:12.473 --> 01:50:14.602
All this bloodshed
was in a good cause.

01:50:14.642 --> 01:50:16.207
You're so cute.

01:51:23.050 --> 01:51:24.729
Nurse.

01:51:24.858 --> 01:51:26.316
Take the patients out.

01:51:28.915 --> 01:51:29.964
Go.

01:51:29.999 --> 01:51:30.879
Quickly!

01:51:37.712 --> 01:51:38.991
No!

01:51:59.042 --> 01:52:00.241
Are you crazy?

01:52:01.492 --> 01:52:02.950
Why did you kill them?

01:52:03.139 --> 01:52:07.049
I'll kill whoever gets in my way.
Always getting in my way…

01:52:54.716 --> 01:52:56.361
–Shoot!
–Drop it!

01:52:58.130 --> 01:52:59.250
Shoot!

01:52:59.898 --> 01:53:03.344
I'll blow this place up.
You want to take that risk?

01:53:06.164 --> 01:53:08.152
<i>We'll all die together.</i>

01:53:10.944 --> 01:53:13.131
I can't be beaten. You won't win.

01:53:17.130 --> 01:53:18.455
No!

01:53:20.424 --> 01:53:21.683
It's too dangerous.

01:53:23.196 --> 01:53:24.322
Get the baby out.

01:53:25.003 --> 01:53:26.660
You'll die. Come with me!

01:53:48.462 --> 01:53:49.456
I'm a cop, too.

01:53:55.331 --> 01:53:56.485
Don't go!

01:54:37.709 --> 01:54:39.565
Get the injured out of here.

01:54:48.836 --> 01:54:50.360
We're going for a ride.

01:55:40.654 --> 01:55:42.573
You saved the day.

01:55:42.863 --> 01:55:43.743
Thank you.

01:55:48.447 --> 01:55:49.726
Over there!

01:56:25.081 --> 01:56:28.166
–Tequila, any more babies?
–Thank you!

01:56:29.017 --> 01:56:30.743
–My baby!
–Thank you!

01:56:31.146 --> 01:56:32.300
Thank you!

01:56:33.115 --> 01:56:34.904
–Are you OK?
–Where's Long?

01:56:36.248 --> 01:56:37.402
Upstairs.

01:56:40.787 --> 01:56:42.444
There's someone upstairs.

01:57:07.138 --> 01:57:08.017
Get up!

01:57:10.432 --> 01:57:11.471
Drop your guns!

01:57:13.002 --> 01:57:13.605
Drop your guns.

01:57:13.645 --> 01:57:14.638
Drop them!

01:57:15.292 --> 01:57:16.251
Move back!

01:57:40.518 --> 01:57:41.844
The hard boiled cop.

01:57:42.286 --> 01:57:43.479
You're still here.

01:57:45.379 --> 01:57:47.217
We both lost some men.

01:57:47.789 --> 01:57:48.916
We're about even.

01:57:50.721 --> 01:57:52.366
I'll win if I kill him.

01:57:54.899 --> 01:57:56.463
Shoot!

01:57:57.992 --> 01:57:58.985
Shoot.

01:57:59.157 --> 01:58:00.681
I'll blow his head off.

01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:06.059
Don't shoot.

01:58:07.632 --> 01:58:08.693
You're impotent.

01:58:09.641 --> 01:58:13.816
I thought you were a superhero
but you're just an ordinary man.

01:58:15.586 --> 01:58:16.659
Slap yourself.

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:24.944
And the other side.

01:58:32.055 --> 01:58:33.381
Say, “I'm impotent.”

01:58:37.317 --> 01:58:38.197
I'm impotent.

01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.909
Kneel down.

01:58:52.822 --> 01:58:53.750
Drop your gun.

01:58:55.474 --> 01:58:58.589
How often does someone
humiliate you like this?

01:58:59.691 --> 01:59:00.925
A .38.

01:59:02.825 --> 01:59:04.389
Take your trousers off.

01:59:04.833 --> 01:59:07.404
You bastard, eat shit.

02:00:11.192 --> 02:00:12.518
<i>It's for you.</i>

02:00:14.004 --> 02:00:15.528
<i>I had forgotten.</i>

02:00:16.053 --> 02:00:20.692
<i>Birthdays aren't important
when you don't have a real identity.</i>

02:00:21.114 --> 02:00:23.831
<i>Only you know when my birthday is.</i>

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:26.840
<i>Don't you forget it.</i>

02:00:29.951 --> 02:00:31.719
<i>–Do you have any dreams?
–I do.</i>

02:00:31.759 --> 02:00:34.145
<i>I want to move to Antarctica.</i>

02:00:34.651 --> 02:00:37.435
<i>It's freezing there. You like that?</i>

02:00:37.623 --> 02:00:40.473
<i>At least I can come out of the dark.</i>

02:00:41.305 --> 02:00:47.297
