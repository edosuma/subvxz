00:00.693 --> 00:03.693
<b>1x13 - Homecoming</b>

00:21.564 --> 00:23.668
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

00:24.100 --> 00:27.868
Atrocitus used those planet killers
to tear a hole right through the Maelstrom.

00:27.940 --> 00:31.705
Big enough for his whole
spite armada to roll into Oan space.

00:31.739 --> 00:36.376
I'm sorry, Hal. I'm now a soldier for
the righteous crusade of Atrocitus.

00:36.877 --> 00:39.877
<i><font color="lime"> sync & correction by f1nc0
~ Addic7ed.com ~ </font></i>

00:48.723 --> 00:51.391
So that's it.
That's your plan.

00:51.425 --> 00:55.595
Fine. I just got one question.
Are you nuts!?

00:55.630 --> 00:58.231
Ok. This harebrained scheme
makes my other schemes seem

00:58.266 --> 01:01.568
well-thought-out and practical.
But what else can we do?

01:01.602 --> 01:04.504
Nothing. Thanks to us,
the Red Lantern fleet

01:04.504 --> 01:07.407
will have no trouble
pouring into Guardian space.

01:07.441 --> 01:10.777
And we're stuck here while
Atrocitus flies the Interceptor to Oa

01:10.811 --> 01:12.913
and exterminates the Guardians.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.849
My plan won't help us
beat them to Oa, but maybe,

01:15.850 --> 01:18.752
just maybe, we can get to the
same galactic neighborhood.

01:18.786 --> 01:20.720
Let's move out.

01:23.424 --> 01:24.925
Kilowog.

01:26.627 --> 01:30.530
No. Even you can't beat
an entire armada.

01:30.564 --> 01:31.932
I can slow them down,

01:31.966 --> 01:34.534
maybe buy a little time
for that plan of yours.

01:34.568 --> 01:36.469
You'll need every minute.

01:37.405 --> 01:39.372
You got this, sergeant.

01:50.384 --> 01:53.453
Godspeed, Hal.

01:57.391 --> 02:00.527
Coordinates achieved.
Dropping out of ultra warp.

02:05.666 --> 02:12.105
Oa. At last. Now, the day
of vengeance has arrived.

02:12.139 --> 02:13.239
[beeping]

02:13.274 --> 02:15.575
Incoming message from the surface.

02:15.609 --> 02:18.745
Unidentified vessel,
you have breached Oan space.

02:18.779 --> 02:21.014
Identify yourself immediately.

02:21.048 --> 02:24.384
We are discovered. Initiate attack
before they send Green Lanterns!

02:24.418 --> 02:28.788
Belay that order.
Drusa, your puppet.

02:28.823 --> 02:30.857
[beeping]

02:30.891 --> 02:32.859
I repeat, identify or face...

02:32.893 --> 02:37.330
<i>This is Green Lantern craft Interceptor
requesting emergency landing.</i>

02:37.365 --> 02:39.566
<i>Hal Jordan and Kilowog
have been wounded</i>

02:39.600 --> 02:41.568
<i>and require immediate
medical attention.</i>

02:41.602 --> 02:45.071
<i>I also have vital information
regarding the Red Lanterns.</i>

02:45.106 --> 02:48.875
Understood, Interceptor,
and welcome home.

02:52.246 --> 02:53.947
[birds chirping]

02:53.981 --> 02:56.049
[groaning]

03:00.254 --> 03:05.358
What's going on here?
Where am I?

03:05.393 --> 03:09.662
I... I know her.
It's her. It's...

03:09.697 --> 03:12.866
- Carol. Carol!
- Hal?

03:12.900 --> 03:17.137
Hal!
It is you!

03:17.171 --> 03:20.440
Hal, what are you doing here?

03:20.474 --> 03:24.444
I...
I promised to take you to diner.

03:26.213 --> 03:28.882
[chuckles]

03:32.253 --> 03:35.822
In brightest day, in blackest night,

03:35.856 --> 03:38.525
no evil shall escape my sight.

03:38.559 --> 03:41.161
Let those who worship evil's might

03:41.195 --> 03:45.765
beware my power, Green Lantern's light.

03:54.542 --> 03:58.411
Salaak, bear the injured
to the medical dome immediately.

03:58.446 --> 04:02.682
Yes, yes, as soon as I've received this
vital intelligence the A.I. spoke of.

04:02.716 --> 04:05.018
Then, prep the ship to rendezvous
with our corps in sector...

04:05.052 --> 04:10.090
- Hello, Guardians.
- Atrocitus!

04:10.124 --> 04:13.326
[screams and groans]

04:15.062 --> 04:17.596
Fall back. Fall back!

04:41.455 --> 04:44.224
How is this possible?
What are we to do?

04:44.258 --> 04:48.061
For the moment, nothing, Guardian.
We are in the most fortified spot on Oa,

04:48.095 --> 04:51.197
and even with the corps deployed,
we are not without defenses.

04:54.635 --> 04:57.270
[grunts]
Blast them!

05:01.842 --> 05:05.458
This, perhaps, is not
unlike what the people

05:05.459 --> 05:10.884
of the forgotten zone experienced
at the hands of our Manhunters.

05:10.918 --> 05:12.919
It's hard to believe
it all actually happened.

05:12.953 --> 05:15.588
It was like a dream or something.

05:15.623 --> 05:17.624
One minute, I'm in my office,
and then, bam!

05:17.658 --> 05:19.726
I'm on another planet fighting you.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.429
What?
You look gorgeous, by the way.

05:23.464 --> 05:25.798
Hal, are you all right?

05:25.833 --> 05:28.401
Of course. I'm with you.
Refill?

05:28.435 --> 05:31.437
No, thanks. It's just that
you seem a little...

05:31.472 --> 05:36.276
Look, Carol, all I know is I was
far from you and needed to find you.

05:36.310 --> 05:39.679
And now, we're together.
Everything's going to be ok.

05:39.713 --> 05:44.851
But what happened out there?
Frontier space, the Red armada.

05:44.885 --> 05:46.152
What?

05:46.187 --> 05:48.154
The Red Lantern army.
Were they stopped?

05:48.189 --> 05:51.491
What about your friends out there,
the other Green Lanterns?

05:51.525 --> 05:53.826
What's a Green Lantern?

06:03.716 --> 06:07.118
Ok, Reds.
It may be just a matter of time, 

06:07.153 --> 06:09.754
but I'm not making this easy on you.

06:22.268 --> 06:24.536
[grunts]

06:29.007 --> 06:32.577
- Where is it?
- Carol, what's wrong with you?

06:32.611 --> 06:34.145
Why are we back at the base?

06:34.180 --> 06:36.047
You didn't even look
at the dessert menu.

06:36.081 --> 06:38.616
It's got to be here somewhere.

06:38.651 --> 06:41.619
- What's got to be here?
- Your power battery.

06:41.654 --> 06:43.855
You once told me...
well, Green Lantern told me...

06:43.889 --> 06:47.659
That your power ring has to be recharged
by a battery that he keeps close by.

06:47.693 --> 06:52.230
- Green Lantern told you?
- Yes, you as Green Lantern.

06:52.264 --> 06:55.300
Anyway, since you spend more time
at Ferris air than anywhere else,

06:55.334 --> 06:57.902
it must be... here.

06:59.672 --> 07:02.807
What is it?
Where did it come from?

07:02.841 --> 07:05.443
I believe it came in a gift set
with this.

07:05.477 --> 07:07.879
I think they know each other.

07:07.913 --> 07:10.481
- What are you doing?
- Maybe nothing,

07:10.516 --> 07:12.283
but whenever I have trouble
with my desktop,

07:12.318 --> 07:14.419
the I.T. guys reboot the system.

07:14.453 --> 07:17.422
I'm hoping this will reboot
your system.

07:17.456 --> 07:20.258
Hal, try to remember.

07:21.827 --> 07:24.162
Will yourself to remember.

07:25.965 --> 07:29.434
<i>In brightest day, in blackest night,</i>

07:29.468 --> 07:32.337
<i>no evil shall escape my sight.</i>

07:32.371 --> 07:34.772
<i>let those who worship evil's might</i>

07:34.807 --> 07:39.577
<i>beware my power, Green Lantern's light!</i>

07:39.612 --> 07:42.614
<i>I remember.
Had to do the impossible.</i>

07:42.648 --> 07:44.282
<i>Get to Oa before Atrocitus.</i>

07:44.316 --> 07:46.050
<i>I could only think of one way.</i>

07:46.085 --> 07:50.655
<i>Zamaron. Now I see why you
wanted me along as your bodyguard.</i>

07:52.625 --> 07:54.759
Easy, quick draw.
We're not here to fight.

07:54.793 --> 07:56.294
We're here to beg.

07:58.264 --> 08:01.599
Great Aga'po,
I know you think I'm your enemy,

08:01.634 --> 08:03.434
but there's a galaxy-wide
tragedy brewing,

08:03.469 --> 08:06.604
and only the power of the
Star Sapphires can help stop it.

08:06.639 --> 08:10.308
You risk much, Green Lantern,
asking favors of an enemy.

08:10.342 --> 08:13.978
But perhaps I should first
consult my royal advisor.

08:15.547 --> 08:17.081
Ghia'ta.

08:17.116 --> 08:18.683
It was you who opened my eyes

08:18.717 --> 08:20.918
to the true meaning of love,
Hal Jordan.

08:20.953 --> 08:23.521
My enlightenment met
with resistance, at first.

08:23.555 --> 08:26.524
But then, the truth took
root and spread quickly.

08:26.558 --> 08:28.293
It seems that over the ages,

08:28.327 --> 08:32.330
the Star Sapphires may have lost
sight of the emotion we serve.

08:32.364 --> 08:36.100
Since you helped us regain our
path, what do you ask of us?

08:36.135 --> 08:39.102
I need you to teleport me
my home planet.

08:39.138 --> 08:42.407
What you ask for cannot be done.

08:42.441 --> 08:45.910
But I saw you teleport Carol
Ferris here all the way from Earth.

08:45.944 --> 08:48.680
So use my feelings for Carol
to send me to Earth.

08:48.714 --> 08:51.916
From there, I can fly to Oa and
stop a tragedy before it happens.

08:51.950 --> 08:55.253
The jaunt from Earth was the
longest we've ever attempted,

08:55.287 --> 08:57.689
and we've never sent
anyone the other way.

08:57.723 --> 08:59.791
There is something more.

08:59.825 --> 09:03.261
The spatial displacement
can render the traveler...

09:03.295 --> 09:06.964
- ...unstable.
- It is too dangerous.

09:06.999 --> 09:10.501
If he doesn't reach Oa, not only
will the Guardians be destroyed,

09:10.536 --> 09:14.272
but Atrocitus will lay waste
to all the worlds in their care.

09:14.306 --> 09:18.276
Love and everything else will
cease to exist in Guardian space.

09:18.310 --> 09:21.813
I've got to try.
Please.

09:24.350 --> 09:29.287
Make sure this galaxy remains a
safe garden where love can bloom.

09:45.270 --> 09:47.868
- Carol...
- I know.

09:47.938 --> 09:51.242
The galaxy's in danger, and
you stopped for a 4-course meal.

09:51.276 --> 09:53.144
Go already.

09:57.149 --> 09:59.317
But you're still on
the hook for dessert.

10:08.794 --> 10:10.995
[grunting]

10:26.412 --> 10:28.913
Well, if it's my time to clock out,

10:28.947 --> 10:32.150
at least I know
I went down swinging.

10:34.052 --> 10:36.320
Whoa.

11:17.896 --> 11:19.497
Who are you supposed to be?

11:19.531 --> 11:23.668
I am merely the conduit of the
great hope that surrounds us all.

11:23.702 --> 11:25.269
I am St. Walker,

11:25.304 --> 11:28.806
and I believe I am the first
Blue Lantern in the universe.

11:28.841 --> 11:30.575
Thanks for the power boost.

11:30.609 --> 11:33.511
But one extra soldier ain't
exactly going to turn the tide.

11:33.545 --> 11:36.581
I agree.
That's why I brought a friend.

11:40.853 --> 11:45.823
<i>I am honored to help
Green Lantern Kilowog.</i>

11:47.192 --> 11:50.461
Now, that's more like it.

11:52.631 --> 11:54.198
You're leaving us, Razer?

11:54.233 --> 11:57.401
I won't lounge here in
luxury while evil triumphs.

11:57.436 --> 11:59.770
Then go
in the spirit of love.

11:59.805 --> 12:02.240
Love will doubtless be
foremost in my mind

12:02.274 --> 12:06.110
as I hurl myself into the path
of an unstoppable armada.

12:06.144 --> 12:09.780
You are not as far gone
as we had assumed, Razer.

12:09.815 --> 12:12.683
There is still love in your heart.

12:12.718 --> 12:18.623
If you truly wish to help Hal Jordan,
there is another way.

12:25.163 --> 12:26.898
You go, Mogo!

12:26.932 --> 12:30.301
[chuckles] You know, considering
my backup is a couple of rookies,

12:30.335 --> 12:32.303
I'm starting to feel lucky.

12:32.337 --> 12:36.007
Don't put your trust in luck,
friend. She is fickle.

12:39.711 --> 12:42.647
[indistinct]
Shoot it, Mogo. Now!

12:50.923 --> 12:52.523
[gasps]

13:02.868 --> 13:05.202
- What are they?
- Liberators.

13:05.237 --> 13:07.672
Planet killers.

13:07.706 --> 13:11.208
Our triumph is at hand.

13:11.243 --> 13:14.745
Only a few feet of Raconian
stands between me

13:14.780 --> 13:19.150
and the vengeance
I have awaited for centuries.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.268
[grunts]

13:37.302 --> 13:39.737
[growls]

13:39.771 --> 13:40.838
Aah!

13:50.048 --> 13:51.849
[grunts]

13:57.122 --> 13:59.624
[beeping]

13:59.658 --> 14:02.493
Any final words, Green Lantern?

14:02.527 --> 14:06.597
Yes.
Open dome.

14:06.632 --> 14:08.165
[clanks]

14:19.533 --> 14:25.000
Welcome Green Lantern.
You've arrived just in time to watch 

14:25.035 --> 14:29.640
the Guardians pay for their
crimes against the forgotten zone.

14:31.343 --> 14:34.245
[grunts]

14:34.279 --> 14:37.348
Well, as much as I've been looking
forward to the winner-take-all,

14:37.349 --> 14:40.417
no-holds-barred cage match,
I've got something to say...

14:40.452 --> 14:43.420
Something I never thought
I'd hear coming out of my mouth.

14:43.455 --> 14:45.556
You're right.

14:47.259 --> 14:50.060
What the Manhunters did
to your sector was a tragedy.

14:50.095 --> 14:51.962
Your rage is earned.

14:51.997 --> 14:55.366
But destroying life here isn't
going to change what happened there.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.701
Let's work together to find a solution,

14:57.736 --> 15:00.771
a way to make things better for
the people of the forgotten zone.

15:00.806 --> 15:02.339
Let us help.

15:02.374 --> 15:05.142
You can help, Earth man.

15:05.177 --> 15:12.783
Your dying screams will help
soothe the restless souls of our dead!

15:15.153 --> 15:16.253
Aah!

15:20.158 --> 15:23.661
If you are going to destroy me,
there is a more expedient method.

15:23.695 --> 15:25.863
Destroy you?
I wouldn't dream of it.

15:25.897 --> 15:28.299
I'm just deleting
all of your higher functions

15:28.333 --> 15:31.702
so you'll behave like
a proper NAV computer.

15:31.736 --> 15:33.804
Say good-bye, my puppet.

15:37.175 --> 15:39.810
[grunts]

15:45.383 --> 15:48.519
Razer.
H... how...

15:48.553 --> 15:52.156
It does not matter.

15:59.731 --> 16:02.700
We must find Hal Jordan.

16:12.644 --> 16:16.180
Hey, moon face, that blue ring
of yours is boosting me,

16:16.214 --> 16:17.848
so why ain't it boosting Mogo?

16:17.883 --> 16:19.850
I think I have to be
within a certain proximity

16:19.885 --> 16:22.419
to a green power ring
to amplify its power.

16:22.454 --> 16:26.924
Mogo's is inconveniently located
miles below the surface.

16:29.327 --> 16:32.463
I got an idea.
Let's hope this works.

16:37.002 --> 16:39.103
[grunts]

16:58.089 --> 16:59.356
[grunts]

17:21.079 --> 17:23.012
[sighs]

17:30.522 --> 17:33.891
Well, what do you know!

17:37.762 --> 17:41.899
I've been looking forward to this
for quite some time!

17:41.933 --> 17:44.568
[grunts]
[growls]

17:46.838 --> 17:48.906
[grunts]

17:48.940 --> 17:50.975
Aah! Unh!

17:51.009 --> 17:53.110
[both grunting]

17:55.480 --> 17:57.614
You are no match for me.

17:57.649 --> 17:59.283
[groans]

17:59.317 --> 18:02.619
Aah!

18:02.654 --> 18:06.023
Ooh! Aah!

18:06.057 --> 18:10.995
You never... had...
a chance! [grunting]

18:15.967 --> 18:19.503
He cannot fight on.
He has not the strength.

18:19.537 --> 18:21.905
He may not have the strength...

18:23.641 --> 18:26.276
but does he have the will?

18:32.751 --> 18:35.252
[groaning]

18:38.189 --> 18:39.790
[growling]

18:46.431 --> 18:48.265
[grunts]

18:53.571 --> 18:56.073
Aah!

18:56.107 --> 18:58.042
[grunts]

19:04.082 --> 19:06.350
[inhales and exhales]

19:12.057 --> 19:14.992
Guards! Retreat!

19:15.026 --> 19:17.861
Wait!
Zox, soldiers, all of you!

19:17.896 --> 19:21.231
Listen. Stop this
war before it begins.

19:21.266 --> 19:22.900
I was telling the truth.

19:22.934 --> 19:26.236
The Green Lanterns will help
rebuild your shattered sector.

19:32.210 --> 19:37.014
Do you seriously expect us to
believe that anything will change?

19:37.048 --> 19:40.551
Who here would ever
come to the forgotten zone?

19:40.585 --> 19:43.153
I will come.

19:43.188 --> 19:46.223
What happened to your sector
was a tragedy,

19:46.257 --> 19:51.862
but our willingness to ignore the
tragedy we caused... was a crime.

19:53.932 --> 19:59.236
I pledge to you
the Guardians will make restitution.

20:15.787 --> 20:21.592
You will find me a loud and grating
voice of justice for my sector, Guardian.

20:21.626 --> 20:26.763
Whatever reparations you think
are enough, start by doubling them.

20:26.798 --> 20:30.601
Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss. More or less.

20:30.635 --> 20:33.270
Can the Guardians trust Zilius Zox?

20:33.304 --> 20:37.241
They can trust him to do whatever's in
his best interest, and that's a start.

20:37.275 --> 20:40.844
Razer, how in the world did
you get to Oa as fast as I did?

20:40.879 --> 20:42.079
I...

20:42.113 --> 20:44.915
2814, you have not
yet been debriefed.

20:44.949 --> 20:48.986
That is, we Guardians
have not yet had a chance to...

20:49.020 --> 20:52.823
[coughs]
to thank you, Hal Jordan.

20:52.857 --> 20:54.658
You just did.

20:55.994 --> 20:58.929
But I've got to get back to Earth.

20:58.963 --> 21:02.099
You have just
averted an intergalactic war.

21:02.133 --> 21:05.636
What on Earth could
possibly be more important than that?

21:05.780 --> 21:07.648
Dessert.

21:27.289 --> 21:30.671
