welcome to the forge.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.129
You are here
for three timed rounds

01:27.129 --> 01:29.506
of edged weapon making
specifically designed

01:29.506 --> 01:31.008
to test every aspect
of your skills

01:31.008 --> 01:32.884
in front of a panel
of expert judges

01:32.884 --> 01:34.511
that will tell us which of you

01:34.511 --> 01:36.013
is the next
"Forged in Fire" champion

01:36.013 --> 01:38.682

for $10,000.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.058
Let's meet your judges now.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.643
Up first, two‐time

And last,
edged weapons specialist,

01:48.984 --> 01:51.361
Doug Marcaida.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.988
One of the things
that I like most

01:52.988 --> 01:55.490
about knifemaking
is the selection of your steel.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.701
Do you guys want to know
what you're using today?

01:57.701 --> 02:00.245
‐ Yeah.
‐ All right.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.290
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

02:04.333 --> 02:08.170
We've got every type of steel
you could possibly imagine,

02:08.170 --> 02:10.213
from 1095 stock steel

02:10.213 --> 02:12.507
to 52‐100 ball bearings.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.177
You'll have to select
at least four of these steels

02:15.177 --> 02:17.387
to use in a Canister Damascus.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.598
Gentlemen, we've got
canoe canisters

02:19.598 --> 02:21.558
and we've got
top‐fed canisters.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.394
You must choose one
of these canisters to use

02:24.394 --> 02:26.271
during this forging process.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.731
In the second round,

02:27.731 --> 02:29.566
you'll attach handles
to your blades.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.068
Then we'll test them
for strength and durability

02:31.068 --> 02:33.737
in a paint can stab and chop,

02:33.737 --> 02:36.740
and for edge retention
in an apple slice.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.784
You have ten minutes
to work on your designs.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.869
You've got three hours
to forge your blades.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.373
Bladesmiths, choose your steel,
choose your ken.

<i>‐ Canister Damascus</i>
<i>I've never done before,</i>

02:53.131 --> 02:56.134
<i>but I know it's important</i>
<i>to make sure you pack</i>

02:56.134 --> 02:58.428
all the powder
and the metal tightly

02:58.428 --> 03:00.138
into the canister.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.640
<i>If you don't, it's not gonna</i>
<i>be very good.</i>

03:01.640 --> 03:03.725
‐ Eric's got some fish hooks
over there.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.104
Files, horseshoes,
some other square stock.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.773
<i>‐ I chose a tanto</i>
<i>because I wanted something</i>

03:09.773 --> 03:12.984
<i>with a really straight</i>
<i>and pointy tip for stabbing.</i>

03:12.984 --> 03:16.655
My biggest strength would be
just being different, creative.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.491
<i>I can look at a scrap piece</i>
<i>of metal, and I could</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:22.119
turn it into something
that's shiny and chrome.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.080
‐ I'm going with
what I'm most familiar with.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.249
<i>Ball bearings,</i>
<i>the roller bearings,</i>

03:27.249 --> 03:29.960
<i>the spring steel, the rebar.</i>

03:29.960 --> 03:33.463
<i>I chose to do</i>
<i>a drop‐point recurve</i>

03:33.463 --> 03:36.133
<i>because it's the first</i>
<i>successful blade I made</i>

03:36.133 --> 03:38.510
in my shop for someone else,
so it's kind of become

03:38.510 --> 03:39.803
personal for me.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.680
<i>As far as competitiveness,</i>

03:41.680 --> 03:43.849
<i>my sons have never beaten me</i>

03:43.849 --> 03:47.185
<i>in basketball in my driveway</i>
<i>and have given up trying,</i>

03:47.185 --> 03:50.021
so if you beat me,
it's because you've earned it.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.690
<i>‐ I'm very concerned.</i>

03:51.690 --> 03:53.859
I've never done any kind
of Canister Damascus,

03:53.859 --> 03:55.444
upright or canoe.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.612
<i>I'm choosing</i>
<i>the upright canister.</i>

03:57.612 --> 04:00.198
<i>The canoe canister,</i>
<i>that looks like it requires</i>

04:00.198 --> 04:03.160
a lot of welding, and I am
a terrible welder.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.455
‐ Is there any advantage
to using a canoe canister

04:06.455 --> 04:08.373
versus an upright canister?
‐ Most definitely.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.167
With a canoe can,
what you can do

04:10.167 --> 04:12.335
is you can pick your steels
and layer them.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.672
<i>‐ I get the bicycle chain,</i>
<i>the chainsaw blade,</i>

04:15.672 --> 04:18.800
<i>the band saw blades,</i>
<i>and the larger cubes.</i>

04:18.800 --> 04:21.678
<i>My game plan is to make</i>
<i>a clip‐point hunter.</i>

04:21.678 --> 04:23.889
<i>It's got a really stout edge</i>
<i>to it.</i>

04:23.889 --> 04:26.683
<i>I'm really into</i>
<i>fantasy genre of novels.</i>

04:26.683 --> 04:28.185
<i>You know, I do a lot</i>
<i>of reading.</i>

04:28.185 --> 04:30.353
In fact, I have a tattoo
from the One Ring

04:30.353 --> 04:31.646
from "Lord of the Rings."

04:31.646 --> 04:33.148
<i>That was a big inspiration</i>

04:33.148 --> 04:35.692
<i>into getting</i>
<i>into knifemaking.</i>

04:35.692 --> 04:38.695
<i>‐ Wil tells us we have</i>
<i>to do Canister Damascus</i>

04:38.695 --> 04:40.989
and I'm a little bit scared
of the timeframe.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.700
It takes a lot of time to prep,
and if you don't get

04:43.700 --> 04:46.369
that initial forge weld perfect
on the first time,

04:46.369 --> 04:48.038
you might as well start over.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.541
‐ Well, I see Deke
grabbing some ball bearings.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.043
‐ I want a random pattern,

04:53.043 --> 04:54.419
so what I'm gonna do
is really mix it up.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.213
‐ What else has he got
over there?

04:56.213 --> 04:57.881
‐ Fish hooks, bicycle chains,

04:57.881 --> 04:59.758
the W‐1 round.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.344
‐ I like those materials
because they're all

05:02.344 --> 05:04.387
<i>hardenable metals.</i>

05:04.387 --> 05:06.223
<i>I'm designing</i>
<i>a drop‐point Bowie</i>

05:06.223 --> 05:07.724
<i>because I think it will</i>
<i>stab well,</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:09.226
<i>and it will slice</i>
<i>just the same.</i>

05:09.226 --> 05:10.769
<i>But I do everything</i>
<i>on the fly,</i>

05:10.769 --> 05:13.396
so I know it's gonna change.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.191
‐ Bladesmiths, your ten‐minute
design window has closed.

05:16.191 --> 05:19.569
Your three‐hour forge time
starts now.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.571
And off they go.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.073
<i>[rousing rock music]</i>

05:23.073 --> 05:25.116
Now, Brian is coming back
from the pantry.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.576
He's got a lot of white‐out.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.245
What's he gonna do
with that, Ben?

05:28.245 --> 05:30.121
‐ He's gonna line the inside
of his can to stop the steel

05:30.121 --> 05:32.916
from sticking to his can.
<i>‐ So while the liquid paper</i>

05:32.916 --> 05:36.253
is drying, I'm washing down
with a solvent

05:36.253 --> 05:38.255
<i>all of my steel</i>
<i>to make sure I don't have</i>

05:38.255 --> 05:39.589
<i>any grease or oil on it.</i>

05:39.589 --> 05:41.258
‐ Brian's doing a lot
of careful work.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.093
It's good to see.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.095
<i>‐ What's hard about</i>
<i>a Canister Damascus</i>

05:45.095 --> 05:47.430
<i>is you don't know</i>
<i>what's going on on the inside.</i>

05:47.430 --> 05:50.433
It can be something
really good, or it can be

05:50.433 --> 05:53.395
something that sends you home.
[laughs]

05:53.395 --> 05:54.938
‐ Now, the first part
of this challenge

05:54.938 --> 05:56.606
is all about the heat.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.276
It's a really good, tough test

05:59.276 --> 06:01.570
of a bladesmith's skill.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.113
‐ What I would love
to have seen

06:03.113 --> 06:05.115
is that can overfull.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.659
If it's under‐full,
what happens when you go

06:07.659 --> 06:09.411
to compress the can
is it just kind of squirts

06:09.411 --> 06:12.289
in all directions.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.125
<i>‐ Every time I've failed</i>
<i>at Canister Damascus</i>

06:15.125 --> 06:16.835
<i>it's usually because</i>
<i>I had space</i>

06:16.835 --> 06:19.296
<i>that wasn't filled in there...</i>

06:19.296 --> 06:22.340
<i>so I'm gonna spend a lot</i>
<i>of time prepping and tamping.</i>

06:22.340 --> 06:23.967
‐ Well, here's something
I didn't like

06:23.967 --> 06:25.802
that Deke just did:
we saw him pour

06:25.802 --> 06:28.805
that 1095 powder
directly into that can.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.016
He just filled that can
with white‐out.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.101
‐ You really need
to let that white‐out dry.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.519
That gives you
the easiest time

06:34.519 --> 06:36.438
peeling off the can later.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.941
‐ But here's the other thing:
this is a 19‐year‐old smith.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.319
He's adjusting
those tongs perfectly

06:42.319 --> 06:45.488
for what he needs and‐‐
and I've seen master smiths

06:45.488 --> 06:48.366
skip this stage
and fight for hours

06:48.366 --> 06:50.160
with their tongs.
‐ Yeah.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.953
‐ Yeah, buddy.
‐ Whew!

06:51.953 --> 06:55.332
‐ Get her done.
‐ Let's get her done.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.667
‐ I got the canister
all set and prepped

06:57.667 --> 07:01.504
and brought over
to the welding station.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.007
<i>After a while, the tip starts</i>
<i>gumming up with metal</i>

07:04.007 --> 07:05.842
<i>and it's not coming out.</i>

07:05.842 --> 07:08.345
‐ Trying to get it running?
‐ Yeah.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.388
The beater's on a wire.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.015
‐ Come on, you son‐of‐a‐bitch.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.725
‐ This young man has it on.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.477
I mean, he's‐‐
he's going for it.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.479
‐ The rebar for the handle...

07:17.479 --> 07:19.147
‐ Thanks, man.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.315
Starting getting back
to welding,

07:20.315 --> 07:23.526
and it's much appreciated.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.528
<i>‐ I think it's going</i>
<i>pretty well.</i>

07:25.528 --> 07:28.531
I'm trusting good preparation's
gonna pay off in the long run.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.367
[pounding]

07:30.367 --> 07:33.536
<i>I have a pleasant surprise</i>
<i>of my can opening itself</i>

07:33.536 --> 07:37.040
and I can see the billet inside
is one piece,

07:37.040 --> 07:40.168
<i>and that gives me</i>
<i>great comfort.</i>

07:40.168 --> 07:41.544
There we go!
‐ All right!

07:41.544 --> 07:43.672
‐ One hour in
and one of our smiths

07:43.672 --> 07:45.173
has their can off.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.883
‐ The one who took time
to clean

07:46.883 --> 07:49.511
all the metals that they were
putting in there.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.180
<i>‐ As I'm trying to open up</i>
<i>this canister,</i>

07:52.180 --> 07:54.599
<i>I'm seeing good things</i>
<i>on the sides.</i>

07:54.599 --> 07:56.768
And then I get the top
completely off...

07:56.768 --> 07:59.604
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

07:59.604 --> 08:01.189
Uh‐oh.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.358
<i>Where I put those big</i>
<i>cube chunks,</i>

08:03.358 --> 08:04.901
none of that's welded.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.695
<i>It's just kind of hanging out.</i>

08:06.695 --> 08:08.196
My canister took a [bleep],

08:08.196 --> 08:10.240
and I have to start
another one.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.200
<i>I'm doing the same process,</i>
<i>putting in my powder,</i>

08:12.200 --> 08:13.743
<i>except this time</i>
<i>instead of using</i>

08:13.743 --> 08:16.371
<i>those big cubes,</i>
<i>I use the small cubes.</i>

08:16.371 --> 08:18.623
<i>I can't blame the material,</i>
<i>but I don't think that</i>

08:18.623 --> 08:20.583
<i>those big cubes</i>
<i>helped anything</i>

08:20.583 --> 08:23.586
in the situation, 'cause I used
such small other pieces.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.422
Damn it.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.382
<i>I'm not sure where</i>
<i>these sparks are coming from,</i>

08:27.382 --> 08:29.050
but my table's on fire.
