WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:01.469
.

00:01.502 --> 00:02.670
- In the criminal justice
system, sexually based offenses

00:05.106 --> 00:06.540
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.277
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.310 --> 00:11.112
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.145 --> 00:12.480
are members of an elite squad

00:12.513 --> 00:14.415
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.418
These are their stories.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.520
- It's a little
crisper tonight.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.489
It's finally feeling
like normal weather.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.125
- Yeah, that's crazy.
It was 70 in February, remember?

00:24.158 --> 00:25.359
- [laughs]
But there's definitely

00:25.393 --> 00:26.594
no such thing as
global warming.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.129
- Yeah, and tell that
to the EPA.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.431
Oh, no, wait--
there is no EPA.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.367
- "Samra."
Isn't that on our list to try?

00:33.401 --> 00:35.269
- Yeah, Bill and Tony
raved about it.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.438
Modern Syrian cuisine.
Apparently, the fried kibbe here

00:37.471 --> 00:39.140
is awesome.
- Yum.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.341
- Take another lap
around the block?

00:40.374 --> 00:41.642
- We'll miss the news.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.177
- Maybe we're better off.

00:43.211 --> 00:46.180
Come on.
It's a beautiful night.

00:46.214 --> 00:49.083
[dog barking]

00:49.117 --> 00:50.551
[woman shouting,
glass breaking]

00:50.584 --> 00:52.386
[faint screaming]

00:52.420 --> 00:53.654
- [grunting]

00:53.687 --> 00:55.389
Help!
Help!

00:55.423 --> 00:57.358
Help us! Stop!
Take the money!

00:57.391 --> 01:00.428
[screaming]

01:01.329 --> 01:02.830
[smacking]

01:02.863 --> 01:05.366
- Where are your Muslim gods
now, huh?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.435
- Come here.
Come here, you towelhead.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.170
- Shut up.
[screaming and crying]

01:09.203 --> 01:10.438
[girl shouting indistinctly]

01:10.471 --> 01:11.839
- Easy!
- Get off me!

01:11.872 --> 01:13.374
- [screaming]

01:13.407 --> 01:14.508
- Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.676
- Stop it!
- Not yet.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.411
- Huh?
- Get up!

01:17.445 --> 01:20.314
- [crying] No!
- Dirty Muslim bitch.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.516
- Leave her--leave her alone!
- Help, Mom!

01:22.550 --> 01:24.285
Mom! [crying]
- Mmm!

01:24.318 --> 01:26.454
This is gonna be good!
- Leave her alone!

01:26.487 --> 01:28.322
Let's go, come on.
Right over here.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.857
- This isn't worth it, man.
[screaming and crying]

01:29.890 --> 01:31.292
- Come on! Let's go.
- Leave her alone.

01:31.325 --> 01:35.229
Let's go. Let's go.
- No, no!

01:35.263 --> 01:37.298
- No, no, no!

01:37.331 --> 01:38.899
- Hey, you wanna have
some fun, baby?

01:38.932 --> 01:42.270
- [crying]

01:42.303 --> 01:44.272
- Hey, this isn't what we came--
- Shut up!

01:44.305 --> 01:46.274
[slam]

01:46.307 --> 01:48.209
- [crying]
- Don't worry, baby.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.211
I'll be gentle.
[gun clicks]

01:50.244 --> 01:52.613
- [sobbing]
No. No.

01:52.646 --> 01:56.250
- [sobbing]
- No!

01:56.284 --> 01:58.352
- NYPD coming through.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.254
I came as soon as I could.
How bad is it?

02:00.288 --> 02:04.358
- It's as bad as it gets.
One DOA--Shala Samra.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.294
She's raped,
has a fractured skull.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.197
And her older sister,
Lela--she was raped,

02:09.230 --> 02:10.531
but she'll live.
She's on her way to Bellevue

02:10.564 --> 02:11.699
with her mother.
- But the father?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.201
- Kanann Samra.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.635
He's in critical condition--

02:14.668 --> 02:16.504
blunt-force trauma to the head,
two stab wounds.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.339
He's on his way
to Bellevue too.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.707
- Lieutenant Benson?
Detective Lopez.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.909
- Yeah, sure--Ray.
How you doing?

02:21.942 --> 02:23.211
- Been better.
Let me walk you guys

02:23.244 --> 02:24.245
through the scene.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.679
According to the mother,

02:25.713 --> 02:28.482
three perps forced
their way in--tied 'em up.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.484
After they did the rapes
and the murder,

02:30.518 --> 02:33.287
they ran out
the front door.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.224
Ten minutes later,
the mother escapes.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.559
She flagged down
a cop car.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.261
- Can she say anything?

02:40.294 --> 02:43.397
- Not really.
Poor lady's a mess.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.666
- They did a number
on this girl.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.669
[dark music]

02:48.702 --> 02:50.704
*

02:50.738 --> 02:52.973
- The cash register,
the wall safe--

02:53.006 --> 02:54.542
both cleaned out.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.976
Techs are still dusting
for prints,

02:56.009 --> 02:57.511
but no matches
in the system yet.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.313
- Feels like more
than a robbery gone bad.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.681
- Yeah.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.550
- Lieutenant.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.286
[police radio chatter]

03:05.319 --> 03:06.320
*

03:06.354 --> 03:07.755
Take a look.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.590
- [sighs]

03:09.623 --> 03:12.260
*

03:12.293 --> 03:14.262
- It's a hate crime.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.496
*

03:17.431 --> 03:20.401
[dramatic music]

03:20.434 --> 03:27.475
*

04:03.511 --> 04:06.046
- This is from last night in
front of Samra's Restaurant,

04:06.079 --> 04:09.383
10:10 p.m.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.485
- Three males in ski masks.
That's it?

04:11.519 --> 04:13.387
Nothing else?
- Taru's going through

04:13.421 --> 04:14.622
the footage
frame by frame.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.490
We're canvassing
the neighborhoods,

04:16.524 --> 04:18.992
talking to neighbors,
looking for video, witnesses...

04:19.026 --> 04:20.461
- Any forensics at the scene?
- Oh,

04:20.494 --> 04:21.762
they're still going
through it.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.597
This place was
a mess.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.466
- My God.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.001
This kind of
racism and hate.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.671
It's 2017.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.373
- It's happening
everywhere, Chief.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.374
- Well, it shouldn't
happen here.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.075
Not in New York City.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.378
We're working this 24/7.
All hands on.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.979
All precincts,
all boroughs.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.416
I see Hate Crimes
is already involved.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.751
What do you have, Ray?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.319
- We're talking to all
our informants

04:45.353 --> 04:46.687
in the streets, prisons,
and gangs.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.988
- Have you been
in touch with the FBI?

04:48.021 --> 04:49.423
- Just got off
the phone with

04:49.457 --> 04:50.758
the head of
Civil Rights unit.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.460
They want the case--
I told 'em it was ours.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.494
Unless you're telling me
it's not.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.995
- No, this is NYPD.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.630
It's double rape,
one murder.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.566
- We'll call 'em
if we need 'em.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.436
So, what do we know
about the family?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.705
- Kanann and Maya Samra.
They immigrated legally

05:04.738 --> 05:06.440
from Damascus
25 years ago.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.376
Their daughters,
Lela and Shala--

05:08.409 --> 05:09.577
they were born here
in New York.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.778
- It's a family-run restaurant.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.446
They've been in business
15 years.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.714
There's no apparent
financial issues.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.015
- They're like
model citizens.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.584
They pay their taxes,

05:16.617 --> 05:18.051
there's no legal problems
in their past--

05:18.085 --> 05:19.353
not even
a parking ticket.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.454
- Anything else?

05:20.488 --> 05:21.789
- They're practicing Muslims.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.557
They attend a local mosque.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.792
No connection
to any radical groups.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.527
- It's a perfect
American family.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.995
[phone chimes]
- Yeah--oh, good news.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.597
Maya and Lela
are in stable condition.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.064
They're willing to talk.
- Okay.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.600
Rollins, you come with me.
Fin and Carisi,

05:32.633 --> 05:33.801
go back to the crime scene.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.836
Talk to anyone
and everyone:

05:35.869 --> 05:38.472
neighbors, shop owners,
competitors--you know--

05:38.506 --> 05:39.773
patrons of
the restaurant...

05:39.807 --> 05:41.642
There are hundreds
of Muslim restaurants.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.577
They picked Samra.
I wanna know why.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.713
- On it, Liv.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.820
[crowd shouting]

05:57.124 --> 05:59.393
- Let me guess:
you wanna see my papers.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.462
I was born here, dude.
135th Street.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.096
- Nah, we're NYPD.
We don't care about that.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.832
So, you own this place?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.567
- Ten years.
- We just wanna know

06:06.600 --> 06:08.168
what you can tell us
about the Samras.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.472
- Good, hard-working people.
Two beautiful girls.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.607
What happened,
I'm sick over it.

06:13.641 --> 06:16.176
- Oh, we are too.
Believe me.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.512
- So, as far as you know,
there was nothing...

06:18.546 --> 06:20.080
unusual going on
over there?

06:20.113 --> 06:21.849
- "Unusual"?
You mean--

06:21.882 --> 06:23.684
are they terrorists?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.686
- Listen, all right?
I got two raped,

06:25.719 --> 06:27.455
and a dead 18-year-old.
So we need to rule out

06:27.488 --> 06:29.189
certain things.
Like, were they involved

06:29.222 --> 06:30.658
in any kind of
criminal activity?

06:30.691 --> 06:32.493
Drugs, gambling--

06:32.526 --> 06:34.127
I didn't say anything
about being a terrorist.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.196
- I'm so sick of all
the harassment and fighting.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.799
Everyone--
even the Hispanics hate us now.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.734
They blame us
for the raids, the deportations:

06:40.768 --> 06:42.770
"If it weren't
for ISIS or 9/11,

06:42.803 --> 06:44.605
none of this
would be happening."

06:44.638 --> 06:46.674
Like it's our fault these people
don't have papers.

06:46.707 --> 06:47.808
- Did the Samras ever say

06:47.841 --> 06:49.510
anything about
being harassed

06:49.543 --> 06:51.211
because they were Muslim?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.614
- About a month ago,
their front windows got broken.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.115
Someone did some graffiti
on the door:

06:55.148 --> 06:56.884
"Go home, Muslims."

06:56.917 --> 06:58.719
- They know who
they were?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.521
Maybe they called
the cops?

07:00.554 --> 07:02.523
- They didn't call anyone.
Too scared.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.858
They replaced the windows,
scrubbed off the graffiti.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.094
Maya said,
"I want to stay focused

07:07.127 --> 07:10.163
on the good in people."
Now look where she is.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.767
- Thank you, sir.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.472
- It was after 10.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.574
I was locking up
for the night.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.776
There was
a very loud banging.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.813
I thought maybe
a customer forgot something,

07:25.846 --> 07:27.180
so I-I...

07:28.181 --> 07:30.217
[sobs, sniffles]

07:30.250 --> 07:31.819
No.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.554
I opened the door.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.523
I don't know why
I opened the door.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.158
- Mrs. Samra,
you couldn't have known.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.727
- [sighs]

07:39.760 --> 07:43.597
Three men in ski masks--
they pushed in.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.866
They had guns.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.603
They were shouting,
"Where are your papers?

07:49.637 --> 07:53.874
We demand to see
your papers."

07:53.907 --> 07:56.910
Then they ripped off
our hijabs.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.814
- What about their voices?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.750
Did they have accents?

08:02.783 --> 08:04.885
- No.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.288
They sounded like
New Yorkers--

08:08.321 --> 08:10.190
young, white,
I think.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.795
- Then what happened next?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.798
- They forced me, Kanann,
and the girls...

08:17.831 --> 08:19.633
[sniffles]
Into the kitchen.

08:19.667 --> 08:23.771
They tied us up and
they started breaking things.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.305
Kanann was trying
to get free.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.675
[inhales deeply]
They started kicking him.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.778
[exhales deeply]
Then they stabbed him.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.812
- Okay.
Was there anything

08:31.845 --> 08:33.581
that they said...

08:33.614 --> 08:35.916
that you remember
specifically?

08:35.949 --> 08:38.251
- They wanted money.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.588
One said...

08:40.621 --> 08:42.656
"The girl is cute."

08:44.758 --> 08:47.728
[solemn music]

08:47.761 --> 08:48.996
*

08:49.029 --> 08:52.933
They were talking
about Shala.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.203
And then Lela.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.339
I shut my eyes, but...

08:59.372 --> 09:03.811
*

09:03.844 --> 09:06.647
I could hear the sounds.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.281
*

09:08.315 --> 09:10.317
And then it was quiet.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.653
- I'm so sorry, I...

09:12.686 --> 09:14.354
*

09:14.387 --> 09:17.658
I can't imagine.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.893
- I was helpless...

09:19.927 --> 09:22.963
in my own restaurant...

09:22.996 --> 09:24.832
while my two daughters...
[sighs]

09:24.865 --> 09:26.266
Um...

09:26.299 --> 09:30.370
*

09:30.403 --> 09:33.040
When they left,
I broke free.

09:33.073 --> 09:37.377
*

09:37.410 --> 09:40.080
I saw that Shala was dead.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.381
*

09:41.414 --> 09:42.816
- [quietly]
Okay.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.051
Why don't we
take a break?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.385
Can I get you some water--

09:45.418 --> 09:46.787
- One of them didn't yell.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.088
He whispered.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.357
- Okay.
That's helpful.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.092
Do you remember
what he whispered?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.294
[footsteps approach]

09:54.327 --> 09:56.797
- Sorry to interrupt, but
I need to speak with Mrs. Samra.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.998
- Is it Lela?

09:58.031 --> 10:00.934
Is she okay?
- She's okay.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.970
It's, um...

10:03.003 --> 10:04.972
it's your husband.

10:05.005 --> 10:12.045
*

10:15.883 --> 10:19.419
- So, they killed my sister...

10:19.452 --> 10:21.889
and my father?

10:21.922 --> 10:25.358
- I am so sorry.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.360
- [inhales shakily]
So what do I do now?

10:27.394 --> 10:29.029
- Um...

10:29.062 --> 10:33.066
You...tell me
what you can recall.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.904
The men's faces--
do you remember?

10:36.937 --> 10:41.675
- The one who--
who, uh...

10:41.709 --> 10:43.677
raped me...

10:43.711 --> 10:47.815
I could smell tequila and beer
on his breath.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.751
I wanted to gag.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.686
- I know
this is difficult.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.954
- [straining]
I'm just trying to process

10:53.987 --> 10:55.122
all of this.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.124
My fiancé, Sayid--

10:57.157 --> 10:59.927
he flew home to Damascus
in December.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.831
His father is sick.
He...

11:03.864 --> 11:05.065
he's been trying
to come back,

11:05.098 --> 11:07.034
but he can't...
even though

11:07.067 --> 11:08.468
he has
his green card.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.837
- Have you spoken
with him yet?

11:09.870 --> 11:12.072
I can help you
do that.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.477
- He's more conservative
than I am.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.148
*

11:21.181 --> 11:24.752
[inhales]
I need to speak to my Imam...

11:24.785 --> 11:27.788
*

11:27.821 --> 11:29.422
To figure out how to
explain to Sayid

11:29.456 --> 11:31.892
what happened to me.

11:31.925 --> 11:35.495
*

11:35.528 --> 11:37.364
- Okay.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.766
- Hi.
What do you got?

11:38.799 --> 11:40.200
- Maybe something,
maybe nothing.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.102
CSU says there's
three male footprints

11:42.135 --> 11:43.971
headed out the front door.
- It's consistent with

11:44.004 --> 11:46.506
the mother's story.
- But there's more.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.142
Responding officers found
this back door

11:49.176 --> 11:53.013
unlocked and ajar, but the perps
came in the front door.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.849
- Right.
- All right, check this out.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.452
CSU found this fourth footprint,
fresh from last night--

11:59.486 --> 12:00.954
heading out
the back door.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.455
That's kinda strange,
right?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.124
- Maybe the perps
were looking for an exit.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.393
- Nah.
That print doesn't match

12:06.426 --> 12:08.028
any of the perps'
or Mr. Samra's.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.529
- You're saying
someone else was here

12:09.562 --> 12:10.864
during the commission
of the crime?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.465
- Looks like it.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.802
- And they just
disappeared into the night?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.136
So we're looking
for a ghost.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.139
- Ghost with
a size-ten shoe.

12:25.445 --> 12:25.946
.

12:25.979 --> 12:26.780
- A size-ten male shoe
ain't much to go on.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.183
Not when the city's
about to implode.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.785
- What about the rape kit?
- No skin cells,

12:31.819 --> 12:33.286
no DNA, no semen.
- And nothing

12:33.320 --> 12:35.322
at the crime scene?
- CSU's still working on it,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.224
but it is a busy restaurant.
There's saliva and fingerprints

12:37.257 --> 12:39.126
all over the place.
- What about this Aryan Nation

12:39.159 --> 12:41.161
thing I saw on the news?
- We're workin' on it.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.864
Right now, it's just talk--
violent, racist gang trying to

12:43.897 --> 12:45.165
take credit for
a gruesome hate crime.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.167
It's standard
operating procedure.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.869
- We got a hit
on the tip line.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.403
- Another wacko
trying to take credit?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.205
- No, a couple
from the neighborhood

12:52.239 --> 12:54.107
out walking their dog.
They think they saw something

12:54.141 --> 12:55.175
that might be helpful.
- Good.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.977
Bring 'em in here now.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.111
- Hi, thanks for coming in.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.312
You said you had seen something.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.814
- Yeah, we were
walking our dog,

13:00.848 --> 13:03.050
Feliz, and we
saw this man

13:03.083 --> 13:04.985
just run out of the back alley
of that restaurant.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.054
- It was at
about 10:45 or so.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.155
- You're sure about that?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.356
- Yes.
- The guy--

13:09.389 --> 13:11.058
who ran out into
the alleyway--

13:11.091 --> 13:12.359
what'd he look like?
- He was white.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.194
Dark haired.
- He could've been Arab.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.863
Right?
Or Hispanic.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.264
Or a dark-haired
Wasp from Greenwich.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.232
I have no idea.
- How tall was he?

13:19.266 --> 13:21.969
- Medium height.
Like 5'10", 5'11".

13:22.002 --> 13:23.904
Thin.
- Young, old?

13:23.937 --> 13:26.073
- He was young--20s.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.607
But it was dark.
- Okay, well,

13:27.640 --> 13:31.211
do you recall anything else?
Clothing?

13:31.244 --> 13:32.946
A limp?
Blood?

13:32.980 --> 13:35.849
Anything?
- He was running like hell.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.350
That's what I noticed.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.086
And, to be honest,
we didn't think much of it

13:39.119 --> 13:40.387
at the time, but--
- When we found out

13:40.420 --> 13:41.989
what happened
at the restaurant,

13:42.022 --> 13:43.623
we knew we had to
come forward.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.959
- Thank you guys very much.
- What's happening

13:45.993 --> 13:50.063
in this country is insane.
I mean, this is America, right?

13:50.097 --> 13:53.233
- Thanks for coming in.
Thank you.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.102
- So three men enter
the front door.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.370
- And a fourth--who, apparently,
no one ever saw--

13:57.404 --> 14:00.407
runs out the back door
and leaves a bloody footprint.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.376
- Now, the question is:
did he come with the perps?

14:03.410 --> 14:05.645
Or was he a innocent bystander,
like a waiter

14:05.678 --> 14:07.948
who left a phone and came back?
- Maya said that

14:07.981 --> 14:10.317
they were heading home,
so the staff had already left

14:10.350 --> 14:12.385
by the time
the three perps showed up.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.654
So the back door
was most likely locked.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.289
Let's just assume,
for a moment,

14:16.323 --> 14:18.491
that our mystery man
didn't show up with the perps,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.360
and is
an innocent bystander.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.662
That means he not only
left through the back door,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.132
but he also entered
through the back door.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.666
- Which means he had
to have a key.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.401
- Exactly.
- So what are you waiting for?

14:28.435 --> 14:30.003
Call the family and
see who else

14:30.037 --> 14:31.171
had a key
to the restaurant.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.242
- Someone else was there?

14:35.275 --> 14:38.511
- Yeah, we found
a footprint of a man, size 10.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.247
It doesn't match
the shoeprint

14:40.280 --> 14:41.982
of the other men
we knew were there.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.483
- Maybe it's old.
- We don't think so,

14:43.516 --> 14:45.986
because the impression
was made in blood.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.520
Which means that it's fresh.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.289
And we also have
two eye-witnesses

14:49.322 --> 14:52.159
who saw a man
running out the back.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.962
- Yeah, that back door
was left ajar and unlocked,

14:54.995 --> 14:56.196
so we know
no one broke in.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.531
- Who has the key
to the back door?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.001
- Uh, me, Kanann,
the girls.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.070
- And Yusef.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.073
- Who's Yusef?

15:06.106 --> 15:09.109
- Yusef is my brother, but...

15:09.142 --> 15:11.444
Lela is mistaken.
He doesn't have a key.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.380
Not anymore.
He used to have one

15:13.413 --> 15:15.348
when he worked for us,
but last month--

15:15.382 --> 15:17.517
- We need to know who did this.
- I will do the talking

15:17.550 --> 15:20.220
for this family,
do you understand me?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.024
- Maya, Lela.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.559
We're all
on the same team here.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.528
So we just need you
to talk to us

15:28.561 --> 15:30.330
and tell us the truth.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.065
[tense music]

15:32.099 --> 15:35.235
Does Yusef have a key
to the back door?

15:35.268 --> 15:38.505
- Yusef is not involved.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.108
- Okay.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.111
Is Yusef mid-20s,
thin, with dark hair?

15:44.144 --> 15:45.512
*

15:45.545 --> 15:49.416
- Yes.
Yes.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.385
I'm sorry, but we need
to know what happened.

15:52.419 --> 15:56.123
- I need his address.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.490
- Please,
do not arrest him.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.492
- I need his address now.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.494
*

16:01.528 --> 16:03.563
NYPD!

16:03.596 --> 16:05.465
Yusef Massad,
we need to talk.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.300
- What's going on?
Why all the yelling?

16:07.334 --> 16:09.236
- We need to talk to
Yusef Massad.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.104
- He's not here.
- Mind if we look around?

16:11.138 --> 16:12.239
- You can't just walk
into my apartment--

16:12.272 --> 16:14.074
- Sure we can.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.243
- This is harassment.
- Where's Yusef?

16:16.276 --> 16:17.510
- I look like
his mama to you?

16:17.544 --> 16:20.180
- Two people are dead.
Where is he?

16:20.213 --> 16:22.115
*

16:22.149 --> 16:25.152
[furniture drags
across floor]

16:26.353 --> 16:28.088
- Fin.
[grunting]

16:28.121 --> 16:30.423
[door banging]

16:30.457 --> 16:35.028
*

16:35.062 --> 16:36.363
[groans]

16:36.396 --> 16:38.498
He's gone.
He's runnin'!

16:38.531 --> 16:39.799
- Suspect's on the move,

16:39.832 --> 16:41.401
headed toward Jerome Avenue.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.469
- [panting]

16:42.502 --> 16:44.604
[suspenseful music]

16:44.637 --> 16:47.607
[siren wailing]
- [grunts]

16:47.640 --> 16:50.143
*

16:50.177 --> 16:51.144
- Freeze!

16:51.178 --> 16:52.545
On your knees!

16:52.579 --> 16:54.481
Hands behind your head.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.549
You speak English?
Hands behind your head.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.151
- Your name
Yusef Massad?

16:58.185 --> 17:00.287
- Yes.
- We need to talk to you.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.255
About what happened
at your sister's restaurant.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.590
- I-I don't know anything
about that.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.358
- Then why the hell
were you running?

17:05.392 --> 17:07.660
- Because I'm afraid.
- Of what?

17:07.694 --> 17:11.064
- Being deported.
I...

17:11.098 --> 17:12.532
I don't have documents.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.567
I'm here illegally,
and I'm--uh...

17:14.601 --> 17:16.836
*

17:16.869 --> 17:19.172
- You're what?

17:19.206 --> 17:21.474
- I'm gay.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.476
If I get sent back
to a refugee camp,

17:23.510 --> 17:25.312
they will kill me.

17:34.087 --> 17:34.387
.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.488
- Yusef, we're just trying
to understand what happened

17:36.856 --> 17:38.725
at your sister's restaurant.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.427
Nothin'.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.431
- Shala was raped
and killed.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.700
Your brother-in-law
was beaten to death,

17:47.734 --> 17:50.303
and Lela--
- I know what happened.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.605
I was there.
I saw it with my own eyes.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.443
I wanted to do something.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.778
I swear.
But I...

17:58.811 --> 18:01.881
I was afraid.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.352
I loved Shala and Kanann.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.587
They're my family.
I let them down.

18:08.788 --> 18:13.126
I tried to text 911,
but...nothing happened.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.594
I heard the sirens,
so I ran.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.130
- Did you know
the other men?

18:17.164 --> 18:19.466
- You think I was with them?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.134
You think I-I wanted
this to happen?

18:21.168 --> 18:23.370
- We have to ask.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.871
- Of course I wasn't with them.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.739
- Okay, good.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.641
- So, Yusef,
why were you there?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.710
- To do my chores.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.613
To collect the trash.
To clean the kitchen.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.682
I wasn't supposed to be there.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.484
I usually do that
in the morning,

18:37.517 --> 18:39.386
but I had plans Saturday.
- What time did you

18:39.419 --> 18:40.787
get to the restaurant?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.489
- Around 10:30.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.591
- And you came
in the back door?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.793
- Yes.
I heard all this screaming.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.529
I thought someone had
broken in, and then...

18:51.564 --> 18:53.800
I saw the men
with the masks.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.802
So I...

18:55.835 --> 18:57.570
I hid.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.573
[dark music]

19:00.607 --> 19:01.774
*

19:01.808 --> 19:04.511
I should have
grabbed a knife.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.213
- Yusef, what did you see?

19:06.246 --> 19:08.915
*

19:08.948 --> 19:10.783
- Three men.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.620
*

19:13.653 --> 19:18.758
And they were doing...
horrible things to my nieces.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.761
- All three of them?

19:21.794 --> 19:23.763
- No.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.233
Just two.

19:26.266 --> 19:29.702
The other man
was just standing there.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.405
I saw his face.
He took his mask off

19:32.439 --> 19:34.474
for a few seconds.
- You saw his face?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.942
- Yes.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.811
I think he used to work
for the restaurant.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.947
- Finally, a lead.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.715
- If you believe
what he's saying.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.784
- You don't?
- The guy hid in a closet

19:44.817 --> 19:46.819
and watched his whole family
get terrorized,

19:46.853 --> 19:49.822
and never called his sister?
- He was frightened.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.692
- Then why not say something
when it was all over?

19:52.725 --> 19:55.495
- One, he's ashamed.
Two...

19:55.528 --> 19:57.697
he's an undocumented,
gay Muslim.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.699
In his mind?
He reports this crime,

19:59.732 --> 20:01.000
he's on the next plane
to Syria.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.670
- Yusef.
I heard you arrested Yusef.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.672
- Maya.
He's here,

20:05.705 --> 20:08.575
but he's not
been arrested.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.578
- Please,
don't call Immigration.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.246
- No, of course.
Listen to me.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.449
Our only concern is--
is finding the men

20:16.483 --> 20:17.984
who hurt your family.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.719
- [breathing heavily]
So he's not in trouble?

20:19.752 --> 20:21.554
- No.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.293
- What did he say?
Was he even there?

20:26.326 --> 20:27.794
- Yeah, he was there.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.028
And he saw
everything that happened.

20:29.061 --> 20:33.600
- And he recognized
one of the men.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.968
He thinks he worked
at your restaurant.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.907
[solemn music]

20:40.940 --> 20:42.809
[door opens]

20:42.842 --> 20:48.615
*

20:48.648 --> 20:49.816
- Why didn't you call me

20:49.849 --> 20:51.050
to tell me
you were there?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.853
- I'm sorry.
I just...

20:53.886 --> 20:56.889
I couldn't get myself
to admit that...

20:56.923 --> 21:01.328
I didn't do anything.
That...

21:01.361 --> 21:05.031
I'm so weak.
- No.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.568
- Please...
please forgive me.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.036
*

21:10.069 --> 21:13.706
- You are my brother.
I love you.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.642
And I need you...
[sniffles]

21:15.675 --> 21:17.744
More than ever.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.812
- Yusef,
you said that the man

21:19.846 --> 21:21.748
who took off his mask
may have worked

21:21.781 --> 21:23.550
for the restaurant.
- Yes.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.518
He--he looked familiar.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.053
I've seen him before,
somewhere.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.856
- Did you have any trouble,
Maya, with your employees?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.524
Or former employees?

21:31.558 --> 21:33.893
- No one in particular.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.796
But it's been hard.
We had to fire

21:36.829 --> 21:38.665
a lot of our help...

21:38.698 --> 21:39.932
because they
were undocumented.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.535
If we got raided,
they would fine us.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.371
They would shut us down.
We didn't have a choice.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.906
- Can you give us a list
of anyone you let go?

21:46.939 --> 21:48.841
- Yes, of course.
- And also,

21:48.875 --> 21:51.110
is there a possibility
that there's a group photo?

21:51.143 --> 21:54.013
Maybe of like a...
a party at the restaurant?

21:54.046 --> 21:57.684
Something that Yusef could use
to ID the man he saw?

21:57.717 --> 21:59.819
- Uh, yes.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.788
A couple of months ago,

22:01.821 --> 22:04.724
we had a party
for Shala...

22:06.426 --> 22:08.395
[voice breaking]
When she got accepted

22:08.428 --> 22:11.831
to Columbia.
Everyone was there.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.700
Friends, family, employees.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.703
It--it was wonderful.
[sniffles]

22:16.736 --> 22:17.970
*

22:18.004 --> 22:20.106
- Okay.
Do you recognize anyone?

22:20.139 --> 22:23.142
*

22:23.175 --> 22:24.711
- Yeah.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.113
That's him.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.882
Right there.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.751
- Hector?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.853
No, that's not possible.
- Is he one of the employees

22:33.886 --> 22:35.722
you let go?

22:35.755 --> 22:37.690
- Three weeks ago,
but--we treated him

22:37.724 --> 22:39.626
like family.
He...

22:39.659 --> 22:44.831
*

22:44.864 --> 22:47.900
How could he do this?

22:47.934 --> 22:49.902
- Do you know
where he lives?

22:49.936 --> 22:54.841
*

22:54.874 --> 22:56.142
[knocking]

22:56.175 --> 22:58.845
- Hector Ramirez, NYPD.
- Open up.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.648
[latch clatters]
- Yes?

23:01.681 --> 23:02.815
- Go.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.417
- [grunts]
- [screams]

23:04.451 --> 23:06.419
Wait, don't touch me.
- Go, go this way.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.888
- Oh, my kids...
- Ma'am? Ma'am!

23:08.921 --> 23:10.690
- [shouting in Spanish]
- Back off! Back off!

23:10.723 --> 23:11.891
- Wait, don't touch my--
- Come here, come here.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.092
Come here--
in the kitchen--

23:13.125 --> 23:14.994
- [shouts, pants]
It's okay.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.163
It's okay.
- [shouting in Spanish]

23:17.196 --> 23:19.966
- Is your dad here?
- Don't touch my kids!

23:19.999 --> 23:22.101
- All right,
stay with them.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.870
- What is he doing?
- You calm yourself down.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.137
Calm yourself down.
Now, where is your husband?

23:25.171 --> 23:26.138
- I don't--
- Where is Hector?

23:26.172 --> 23:27.940
- I don't know.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.209
- When's the last time
you spoke with him?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.811
[shouting]
When?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.913
Last night?
Today?

23:33.946 --> 23:35.982
- I don't--I don't know.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.184
- Where's he staying?

23:38.217 --> 23:40.219
- It's clear.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.221
- It's like I said,
he's not here.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.857
- You know what--we think
he is involved with something

23:44.891 --> 23:48.094
very serious, you understand me?
- Where is he, Soledad?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.196
- He didn't do anything wrong.
This is a mistake.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.064
- All right, then tell us where
he is, and we'll sort this out.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.766
- I told you, I don't know.
- You can either tell us

23:53.800 --> 23:54.834
here, or we can take you
down to the station

23:54.867 --> 23:55.868
and you can tell us there.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.504
- I can't leave my kids.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.139
- Oh, no, don't worry.
We'll call social services.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.808
They'll take
good care of 'em.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.110
- So--social services?

24:04.143 --> 24:05.812
*

24:05.845 --> 24:07.814
- I'm telling you
how it is.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.082
*

24:10.116 --> 24:12.985
- He's working at
a new restaurant.

24:13.019 --> 24:16.889
On 125th.
Leo's.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.491
*

24:18.525 --> 24:20.059
- Hey, you stay with her.

24:20.092 --> 24:23.062
Make sure
she doesn't contact him.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.064
*

24:25.097 --> 24:27.867
- NYPD--we're looking
for Hector Ramirez.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.268
Hey, no, no, no--
don't go anywhere, all right?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.070
Hector Ramirez.
We're not Immigration.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.872
- Everybody stay put.
- What's goin' on?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.140
You're scaring the hell
outta my customers.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.842
- Where's Hector Ramirez?
- Hector?

24:35.875 --> 24:37.043
Look, he told me
he had papers--

24:37.076 --> 24:38.778
- No, we're not here about that.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.146
Where is he?
- We need to find him now.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.781
Where is he?
- Let's go.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.182
- The kitchen.

24:43.215 --> 24:45.985
[suspenseful music]

24:46.018 --> 24:47.053
- Hector Ramirez.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.756
Hector Ramirez?

24:49.789 --> 24:50.957
I need to talk to you,
all right?

24:50.990 --> 24:51.958
- ¿Qué?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.860
- [grunting]

24:53.893 --> 24:56.095
- No!
Mira, ¿qué es esto?

24:56.128 --> 24:57.964
¿Qué está pasando aquí?
- We're gonna talk

24:57.997 --> 24:59.265
about what you did
to the Samras.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.134
- Oh, no--no comprendo,
no comprendo.

25:07.273 --> 25:07.640
.

25:07.674 --> 25:08.575
- No hice nada.
No soy el hombre.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.210
- Sit down.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.812
- Where were you
Friday night, Hector?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.714
- No comprende.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.684
- Yes, you do, Hector.
Yes, you do.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.920
- Hector, look at me.
Look at me.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.590
You want a drink
of water?

25:23.623 --> 25:25.091
- Okay, so you do
understand English.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.225
- Sure he does.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.595
- It wasn't me.
I swear.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.330
- Okay.
Ready to answer some questions?

25:31.363 --> 25:33.232
- Yes.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.701
- Okay, I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.304
All you have to do
is say yes or no.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.339
You worked at
the Samras' restaurant?

25:40.372 --> 25:41.708
- Yes.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.143
- They fired you?

25:44.176 --> 25:46.579
- Yes.
- You were angry?

25:48.280 --> 25:51.250
- Yes or no, Hector.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.253
- Yes.
They still owe me some money.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.922
- Okay, so you went
back there on Friday night

25:55.955 --> 25:57.724
with your two friends,
and you got some revenge,

25:57.757 --> 26:01.861
didn't you?
- Listen close, Hector.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.932
We have a witness--
saw you take your ski mask off.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.601
[tense music]

26:08.635 --> 26:11.170
- They saw you, Hector.
That's game over.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.705
*

26:12.739 --> 26:14.641
Yeah, it is.
But listen.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.343
I'll tell you what.

26:17.376 --> 26:20.212
We think that one of the guys
just watched--

26:20.246 --> 26:22.248
he didn't rape anybody,
he didn't kill anybody.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.916
Now, maybe that guy
was you.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.285
So, what I'm saying is,
if you come clean--

26:26.318 --> 26:28.788
you tell us who
the other two guys were--

26:28.821 --> 26:31.924
you might be able to cut
yourself a deal right now.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.193
- I would never hurt the Samras.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.695
I like them.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.396
- Well, it's a hell of a way
to show it.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.231
- Look, they're good people.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.400
- Good people you
raped and murdered.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.803
- I didn't kill anybody.
Or rape anyone--

26:43.836 --> 26:45.371
I swear to God,
on my children.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.907
- Hey, listen.
I believe you.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.842
You seem like
a good person.

26:49.876 --> 26:51.210
So maybe you did
go back there

26:51.243 --> 26:52.779
because they owed you
some money.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.814
So let's go back.
Take it slow.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.883
Tell me everything
that happened on Friday night--

26:56.916 --> 26:58.951
in your own words.
[knocking]

26:58.985 --> 27:02.221
- Interrogation's over.
- What?

27:02.254 --> 27:03.790
- His lawyer's here.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.391
- I don't have a lawyer.

27:05.424 --> 27:06.993
- You do now.

27:07.026 --> 27:10.196
*

27:10.229 --> 27:12.264
- Naomi Ziegler.
I'm an attorney

27:12.298 --> 27:13.700
with the Immigration
Defense Project.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.334
- Uh-huh.
- I'll be representing

27:15.367 --> 27:16.869
Hector Ramirez.
- Well, you got here quickly,

27:16.903 --> 27:19.038
Ms. Ziegler.
- Desperate times.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.307
Can I ask on what grounds
you're detaining my client?

27:21.340 --> 27:23.743
- Your new client has been ID'd
as being on the scene

27:23.776 --> 27:25.344
of the Samra
double homicide.

27:25.377 --> 27:26.946
- Has he been read his rights?
- Of course.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.815
- Have you arrested him?
- Not yet.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.350
But we have probable cause
to believe that Mr. Ramirez

27:31.383 --> 27:32.952
is involved
in a hate crime.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.987
- He's done talking.
No more questions,

27:35.021 --> 27:37.890
and I want to meet
with him now.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.892
- Right this way.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.866
- Somebody from the bust
must've tipped her off.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.768
- Well,
these immigration lawyers are

27:48.801 --> 27:50.236
popping out of the woodwork.
- With all these raids

27:50.269 --> 27:51.771
taking place--
or rumored to be

27:51.804 --> 27:53.372
taking place--
you can't blame 'em.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.941
- It's actually a good thing.
It protects us

27:54.974 --> 27:56.976
in court
down the road.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.378
- Let's get this Yusef fella
in and make a formal ID.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.412
- Yeah.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.050
- Hey, thank you
so much for coming.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.052
- So, like I said on the phone,
we need Yusef

28:06.085 --> 28:08.721
to officially identify
Hector Ramirez

28:08.755 --> 28:09.989
in a lineup.
- Okay, okay.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.858
But this is what we need:

28:11.891 --> 28:14.260
a guarantee that Yusef
can stay here,

28:14.293 --> 28:16.395
in the United States;
and that no one find out

28:16.428 --> 28:18.898
about his illegal status
during this entire process.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.299
- They won't.
Not from us.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.401
- Because if
he is deported,

28:22.434 --> 28:23.870
you know we will never
see him again,

28:23.903 --> 28:25.004
and I could not bear that.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.272
Lela would be devastated.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.740
Yusef and her are so close.

28:27.774 --> 28:29.809
- How is Lela?
Did her fiancé

28:29.842 --> 28:31.878
make it back from Syria?
- He got a flight

28:31.911 --> 28:34.013
to New York last night.
Finally.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.514
- That's good to hear.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.416
- She doesn't even want
to talk to him.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.886
She's not herself.
- That's normal.

28:39.919 --> 28:43.022
After what she went through...
it'll take some time.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.758
- So, you see,
this is why we need Yusef

28:45.792 --> 28:47.994
here, close to us.
- And we understand

28:48.027 --> 28:50.429
why you're nervous,
but you are gonna be fine.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.431
And Yusef is gonna
be fine, okay?

28:52.464 --> 28:55.467
New York is a sanctuary city.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.937
- So no one will know
I don't have papers?

28:57.970 --> 28:59.438
- That is correct.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.908
We're on your side.
I promise.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.510
- Thank you.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.445
Thank you.

29:06.478 --> 29:09.415
- Would you come this way?

29:09.448 --> 29:10.950
[blinds click]

29:12.151 --> 29:13.986
- Take your time.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.556
- I don't need to.
It's number four.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.958
- I'm very sorry
for what happened

29:18.991 --> 29:20.459
to your family, but are you

29:20.492 --> 29:22.061
absolutely certain that's--
- Stop.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.462
It's not the time or place.
- Of course.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.496
Fine.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.998
- So we're done here.

29:26.032 --> 29:27.934
[knocking]

29:27.967 --> 29:29.802
- Let me talk
to Hector again.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.370
- We need to process him--
- Maybe there's a deal

29:31.403 --> 29:33.072
to be had.
- Unless he coughs up

29:33.105 --> 29:36.142
the other two perps,
there's nothing to discuss.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.346
- Good work, Yusef.
- Uh-huh.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.348
What happens now?
- We arrest Hector,

29:42.381 --> 29:44.951
then we charge him.
- Oh, I mean for me.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.819
What do I need to do?
- You need to testify

29:46.853 --> 29:49.488
in front of a grand jury
so we can formally indict him.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.824
- Okay.
- We can put you

29:51.858 --> 29:54.093
in protective custody.
- No, I'll be fine.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.561
- Just don't leave
the city.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.864
- Let's give him
a protective detail, 24/7.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.066
- I'd feel even better
if it was a detective.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.471
- Carisi.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.573
Will you take
Mr. Massad home--

30:07.606 --> 30:09.842
and stay with him
until we call him

30:09.876 --> 30:11.110
for the grand jury tomorrow?
- Yeah, no problem.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.578
- I don't need a babysitter.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.612
- It's better this way.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.547
- Come on.
Let's go.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.186
- Hey, talk to
Hector's lawyer again.

30:20.219 --> 30:23.022
See if she's convinced him
to make a deal.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.960
- Like I keep saying,
I wasn't there.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.561
- We have a witness
that ID'd you,

30:29.595 --> 30:31.230
swears he saw you there.
Picked you out of

30:31.263 --> 30:32.999
that lineup
in two seconds flat.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.867
- And we're gonna find
your footprints,

30:34.901 --> 30:37.003
your fingerprints, and your DNA
all over that kitchen.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.871
- He used to work there.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.106
- [scoffs softly]

30:40.139 --> 30:42.942
Hector...we don't think

30:42.975 --> 30:46.545
that you meant
to hurt the Samras.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.615
- Everybody we talked to
says you're a stand-up guy.

30:49.648 --> 30:51.650
Good husband.
Good father.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.654
- So be smart.
Do the right thing.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.656
Just tell us.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.159
Who raped Lela?

31:00.192 --> 31:03.062
Who raped and killed Shala?

31:03.095 --> 31:04.630
Who kicked Kanann
in the head,

31:04.663 --> 31:07.099
and then stabbed him
in the stomach?

31:07.133 --> 31:09.601
[dark music]

31:09.635 --> 31:11.037
- If you don't talk,
you're going down

31:11.070 --> 31:12.538
for this whole thing,
bro.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.907
That's life in prison,
no parole.

31:14.941 --> 31:17.609
- I wasn't...there.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.678
- Where were you?
- At home.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.048
With my wife, Soledad.
- With your wife, huh?

31:22.081 --> 31:23.549
- That's what
my client maintains,

31:23.582 --> 31:24.683
and his wife
will back up his story.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.953
- Sure she will.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.487
- No more questions.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.023
- That's his right.

31:31.057 --> 31:33.059
You're under arrest
for rape and murder.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.094
*

31:35.127 --> 31:36.495
With a hate-crime
enhancement.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.097
- Stand up.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.566
[handcuffs clicking]

31:40.599 --> 31:42.068
Come on.

31:42.101 --> 31:48.007
*

31:48.040 --> 31:49.608
- So the immigration lawyer's
playing a game

31:49.641 --> 31:51.944
of liars' poker.
- She's pretty damn good, too.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.212
- Other than Yusef
putting Hector at the scene,

31:53.245 --> 31:54.246
what other evidence
do we have?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.015
- No forensics--yet.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.950
- He claims he was home
with his wife.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.318
- And she's backin'
him up too.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.287
- In the meantime,
we are looking for video

32:01.320 --> 32:03.222
around Hector's apartment,
going through

32:03.255 --> 32:04.957
his phone records,
social media--

32:04.991 --> 32:06.325
looking for anything
to blow up his story.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.094
- What about
the other two perps?

32:08.127 --> 32:09.628
- We're talking to
everybody that Hector knows,

32:09.661 --> 32:11.097
trying to shake something loose.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.099
You ask me, it's just
a matter of time.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.135
I mean, these are not
sophisticated criminals.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.637
It does not feel like
an organized,

32:18.670 --> 32:21.273
anti-Muslim conspiracy here.
- Okay.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.709
In the meantime,
we need to arraign Hector,

32:23.742 --> 32:27.646
show the Muslim community
that we're making some progress.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.285
- Thank you.
Looks good.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.259
- I like your skirt,
but...

32:40.292 --> 32:42.694
- But what?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.963
- Nothing.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.735
It's very fashionable.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.376
I need some cigarettes.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.611
- You shouldn't smoke.
- [laughs]

32:59.645 --> 33:01.313
I shouldn't be
attracted to men.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.582
Either way,
I'm going to the bodega.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.651
- I'm comin' with you.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.055
Hey, Yusef--
if you don't mind me asking,

33:09.088 --> 33:11.057
what was the deal
with that skirt?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.258
With Lela?

33:12.291 --> 33:14.026
[protesters shouting]

33:14.060 --> 33:18.030
- Muslims believe that
modesty, that um...

33:18.064 --> 33:20.699
hiding the skin and the shape
of the body is important.

33:20.732 --> 33:24.370
It protects women
from unwanted sexual advances.

33:24.403 --> 33:25.771
- Right.

33:25.804 --> 33:27.306
[protestors shouting]

33:27.339 --> 33:30.276
- Everyone is so angry.
- I get it.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.144
- No, you don't.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.146
People think we are terrorists.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.582
Like we are all the same.
- Most of us know better.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.251
- I...don't think so.

33:39.285 --> 33:41.620
But this protesting--

33:41.653 --> 33:43.189
what do people think
will happen?

33:43.222 --> 33:45.057
Things will change?
No.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.593
The world doesn't change--
people don't change.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.228
- Yeah, see,
I don't believe that.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.063
People uniting, making
their voices heard, refusing

33:51.097 --> 33:52.364
to be oppressed--that's what
this country's all about.

33:52.398 --> 33:55.167
I mean, that's why
you came here, right?

33:55.201 --> 33:57.669
- I came here because
I like being alive.

33:57.703 --> 34:01.240
[protestors shouting]

34:01.273 --> 34:03.242
[tires screech]

34:03.275 --> 34:07.146
[dramatic music]

34:07.179 --> 34:08.747
Oh, no.
No!

34:08.780 --> 34:11.250
- Whoa, hey--
Yusef, what are you doing--

34:11.283 --> 34:13.452
- [grunts]
- I need to see some ID.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.154
- I wasn't doing anything.
- Okay, listen,

34:15.187 --> 34:16.755
I'm Detective Carisi,
Manhattan SVU.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.290
This man is a material witness
for the NYPD.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.092
- We still need
to see his documentation.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.827
- I understand that, just--
just gimme a sec.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.229
- You have paperwork?
An ID?

34:23.262 --> 34:24.430
- As a courtesy,
gimme a second

34:24.463 --> 34:25.764
to get our DA on
the line.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.299
- Last chance.
Yes or no?

34:27.333 --> 34:28.734
- Don't say anything.
- That's it.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.169
You're comin' with us.
- Hey,

34:30.202 --> 34:31.270
what the hell
are you doing?

34:31.303 --> 34:33.105
I just told you, I'm NYPD.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.706
He's a material witness
for a double homicide!

34:34.740 --> 34:36.175
all:
No more hate! No more hate!

34:36.208 --> 34:37.676
- Yusef!
- Back up.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.278
- Yusef, don't say anything.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.412
You ask for a lawyer,
all right?

34:40.446 --> 34:42.114
- You promised me!

34:42.148 --> 34:44.850
- I'll be there
as soon as I can.

34:44.883 --> 34:46.852
Where the hell
are you taking him?

34:46.885 --> 34:52.458
*

34:52.491 --> 34:54.726
- One of the suspects
in the Samra double murder,

34:54.760 --> 34:56.695
double rape case
has been arraigned

34:56.728 --> 34:58.397
and is being held
without bail.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.499
There's nothing more
to say at this time.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.800
[reporters chatter]

35:01.833 --> 35:03.669
- No comment.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.337
No comment.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.873
- No comment?
- Arraigning a Mexican illegal

35:07.906 --> 35:10.142
is not necessarily the business
we wanna be in right now.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.843
Looks like we're making
this kid a scapegoat--

35:11.877 --> 35:13.845
supporting that crazy talk
down in DC.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.282
- Wait, so if it was a white guy
with scary tattoos?

35:16.315 --> 35:17.783
- Better narrative.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.285
[phone buzzing]
It's been bad since

35:19.318 --> 35:20.352
the election,
but these ICE raids

35:20.386 --> 35:21.687
are just makin' it worse.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.422
- Hey, Carisi.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.524
What?

35:25.557 --> 35:28.327
When?

35:28.360 --> 35:31.730
Okay.
Okay, I'll meet you there.

35:31.763 --> 35:34.266
Yusef just got caught up
in a protest.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.302
ICE snatched him up
15 minutes ago.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.936
- Where'd they take him?
- I don't know.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.438
I'm meeting Carisi
at the Field Office.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.872
- All right,
I'll get you a warrant.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.441
- And let me know
if you hear anything.

35:48.514 --> 35:48.647
.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.548
- Here he is.
- What can I help you with?

35:51.583 --> 35:53.352
- We're looking for
Yusef Massad.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.686
He's a material witness
in a pending

35:54.720 --> 35:56.488
double homicide investigation.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.290
- Do you have a warrant?
- We're in the process

35:58.324 --> 35:59.758
of getting one, yeah.
- Well, when you get one,

35:59.791 --> 36:01.460
you can come back.
- We need to find him right now.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.628
Okay? He's supposed
to testify in front of

36:02.661 --> 36:03.762
the grand jury
tomorrow morning.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.231
- That's not really our concern.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.566
- Okay,
where's your boss?

36:07.599 --> 36:09.368
- Excuse me?

36:09.401 --> 36:12.371
- Go get your boss.
Now.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.639
Look, I realize you're young

36:13.672 --> 36:15.407
and you're trying
to do your job,

36:15.441 --> 36:16.642
but I'm warning you:

36:16.675 --> 36:18.777
I've been doing my job
a long time,

36:18.810 --> 36:20.512
and I got a lot of friends.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.581
- Are you threatening me?

36:31.857 --> 36:33.892
- Yep.
Okay, thanks.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.662
Okay, we're on it.
You should hear back soon.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.730
Hopefully.
- I-I don't understand.

36:38.764 --> 36:42.468
Why is this so complicated?
His name is Yusef Massad,

36:42.501 --> 36:43.869
and he was picked up
an hour ago.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.272
- It's a mess.
That's why.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.407
We don't have enough cells
for all these guys.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.342
We're putting them
in jails, prisons,

36:50.376 --> 36:52.444
army barracks...
any place we can find.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.680
Not exactly a well-oiled
machine at the moment.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.583
- This is absurd.
New York is a sanctuary city.

36:57.616 --> 37:00.352
You're not supposed to be
rounding up immigrants.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.753
- Of course we are.
That's our job:

37:01.787 --> 37:03.755
to round up
illegal immigrants.

37:03.789 --> 37:06.525
Not our fault NYPD thinks
it's above federal law--

37:06.558 --> 37:09.428
- This is a double rape,
double homicide,

37:09.461 --> 37:13.465
so I'm pretty sure that
Yusef is more valuable here,

37:13.499 --> 37:16.368
testifying, than he is
in a refugee camp in Syria.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.504
- That is why
I'm trying to help.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.672
- Okay, when you grab somebody,
what happens next?

37:20.706 --> 37:22.474
What is the process?
- It depends

37:22.508 --> 37:24.876
on who does the grabbing
and who does the processing.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.512
Like I said,
it's a mess right now.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.647
[computer pings]
- [sighs]

37:28.680 --> 37:31.450
- Okay,
we got some good news.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.452
We found your guy--
he is being held

37:33.485 --> 37:35.454
in Paterson, New Jersey.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.389
We got some bad news, too.
It looks like he was

37:37.423 --> 37:39.858
deported previously
for overstaying a student visa.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.693
- Okay, what does that mean?
What are you saying?

37:41.727 --> 37:43.795
- Get to Paterson as fast
as you possibly can--

37:43.829 --> 37:46.498
with a mat-wit warrant
in your hand.

37:49.568 --> 37:50.869
- This is a state court warrant.

37:50.902 --> 37:51.870
- Because it's
a state court case.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.605
- I understand, but that

37:53.639 --> 37:55.407
doesn't give you
jurisdiction over Mr. Massad.

37:55.441 --> 37:56.875
- Mr. Massad is
a material witness

37:56.908 --> 37:58.844
in a double rape,
double homicide case

37:58.877 --> 38:00.812
that has been
on the front page

38:00.846 --> 38:02.514
of every newspaper
in this country

38:02.548 --> 38:03.949
for the past week.
- Irrelevant.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.917
- Is he here or not?
- No.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.487
- Where is he?
- Mr. Massad

38:08.520 --> 38:10.689
is a national security threat.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.624
- And he's being deported
to Syria.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.460
- Okay, so he's being deported.
So he's still here.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.761
- Where is he? What airport?
- I can't disclose

38:15.794 --> 38:17.429
that information.
- Listen, two people

38:17.463 --> 38:18.897
were killed,
and you're deporting

38:18.930 --> 38:20.599
the one person that can
ID the men that did this?

38:20.632 --> 38:22.368
- I don't wanna get
into politics,

38:22.401 --> 38:23.735
so I think it's time
for y'all to leave

38:23.769 --> 38:25.003
before things
get unpleasant.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.772
- No, no, they already
are unpleasant.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.674
- I agree.
Now get the hell outta here.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.909
- Or what?
You're gonna deport me to Cuba?

38:30.942 --> 38:32.744
You gonna take him to Italy?
- Okay, listen--believe it

38:32.778 --> 38:34.513
or not, we're all
on the same side here.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.782
- Y'all have a nice day.
- Okay.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.685
Okay, let's get people
at JFK and at Newark,

38:39.718 --> 38:43.722
and have somebody check
every flight heading to Syria.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.991
- The plane left
ten minutes ago.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.593
- What?
- Sorry.

38:47.626 --> 38:48.794
- Sorry?

38:48.827 --> 38:52.531
- I got bosses--
just like you.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.799
- [sighs]

38:53.832 --> 38:55.534
[dark music]

38:55.567 --> 38:56.802
- They really
deported dude?

38:56.835 --> 38:58.504
- He's over the Atlantic
as we speak.

38:58.537 --> 38:59.805
- So what's that,
payback for us not giving

38:59.838 --> 39:01.640
the case to the FBI?
- Who knows?

39:01.673 --> 39:03.041
With everything that's
going on, they might've

39:03.074 --> 39:04.710
deported him anyway.
- Please tell me we have

39:04.743 --> 39:05.911
more evidence.
- Well, CSU did find

39:05.944 --> 39:07.713
a couple strands
of Hector's hair

39:07.746 --> 39:09.481
at the scene.
- He worked there for months.

39:09.515 --> 39:10.816
He was let go three weeks ago.
It's gonna be easy

39:10.849 --> 39:12.651
to explain that away.
- But three weeks

39:12.684 --> 39:14.486
is a long time--they
obviously clean the place.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.021
It's got an A rating.
- I understand, Carisi,

39:16.054 --> 39:17.823
but no jury's gonna convict
based on two strands of hair.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.892
- What about Yusef's ID?
It was an official lineup.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.561
The defense attorney
was there.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.630
- Without Yusef,
it's meaningless.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.632
We have to indict soon.

39:26.665 --> 39:27.899
- I know, I get it.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.701
*

39:29.735 --> 39:31.437
What are you gonna do?

39:31.470 --> 39:33.739
*

39:33.772 --> 39:35.874
- Pursuant to Rule 180.80
of the Criminal Code,

39:35.907 --> 39:38.644
the people have just released
Hector Ramirez.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.979
He is still the prime suspect
in this case,

39:41.012 --> 39:43.982
and we expect to formally indict
him in the near future.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.051
[crowd clamoring]

39:46.084 --> 39:48.554
- Two rapes, two murders...
- And he gets to walk

39:48.587 --> 39:49.921
out of here like
nothing ever happened.

39:49.955 --> 39:52.491
- Well, he won't
be free for long.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.561
[crowd clamoring]

39:57.763 --> 39:59.465
- Down there.

39:59.498 --> 40:05.871
*

40:05.904 --> 40:06.872
[glass shatters]

40:06.905 --> 40:08.006
- [gasps]

40:08.039 --> 40:10.876
- It's going down.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.879
[indistinct shouting]

40:13.912 --> 40:15.514
- [sighs]

40:15.547 --> 40:20.519
*

40:20.552 --> 40:22.888
- Go back where you came from!
All of you!

40:22.921 --> 40:24.956

40:37.869 --> 40:40.839
