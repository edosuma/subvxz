01:39.355 --> 01:42.224
That instrument is worth
literally $900 million.

But more importantly, he can't
play <i> The Good-bye Song</i>

01:44.827 --> 01:45.760

I will find who stole it,
and they will pay

I wanted to do

All: Wow!

03:27.263 --> 03:28.764
Ah!

03:28.798 --> 03:31.233
Now, the name, "goliath"
means "giant."

03:31.267 --> 03:34.503

03:34.537 --> 03:36.638

No, the wood does not taste
like cherry.

You cannot eat it.

Always remember, kids,
when you find something new,

you must lick it
before you eat it.

Before I say good-bye,
let's review our checklist

18:15.504 --> 18:16.604
one last time.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.839
We made something
with Carpenter Ron.

18:18.874 --> 18:21.142
We learned something
with Professor Smartbrain.

18:21.176 --> 18:22.810
We karate chopped something--

18:22.844 --> 18:24.745
old Mailman Barry's face.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.681
And we tried something new,
even though it was scary to us,

18:27.716 --> 18:29.617
with Leslie Knope.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.153
That leaves just one more thing,

18:32.187 --> 18:34.822
the most important one.

18:34.856 --> 18:37.625
Be nice to someone.

18:37.659 --> 18:40.094
And I think I know right now
who needs it the most--

18:40.128 --> 18:44.899
my wife,
April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer.

18:44.933 --> 18:47.001
Honey, come on out here.

18:47.035 --> 18:48.269
Come here.

18:48.303 --> 18:50.771
Babe.

18:50.806 --> 18:52.206
Hey, babe?

18:52.240 --> 18:55.042
Wait!

18:55.076 --> 18:56.644
Honey, where are you going?

18:56.678 --> 18:58.446
Babe, hey, will you--

18:58.480 --> 18:59.547
Hey, come here.

18:59.581 --> 19:02.616
April, what's going on?

19:02.651 --> 19:06.053
It's...

19:06.087 --> 19:09.323
Every week, this show
is an amazing train wreck,

19:09.357 --> 19:12.393
and you love doing it,
and you're the best host,

19:12.427 --> 19:14.762
like, even better
than my all-time favorite host,

19:14.796 --> 19:16.497
Tom Snyder, which is crazy.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.432
And all those kids love you,

19:18.467 --> 19:21.936
and you're doing
what you're meant to do.

19:21.970 --> 19:24.271
And I can't be the person that
makes you lose what you love.

19:24.306 --> 19:25.506
Yeah, but you're what I love.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.675
You're the only reason
I have any of this.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.544
You believed in me,
and you supported me.

19:30.579 --> 19:32.780
You make me happy...

19:32.814 --> 19:35.449
happier than I ever thought
I could be.

19:35.484 --> 19:38.319
Without you,
I wouldn't be anything.

19:38.353 --> 19:40.888
You're what keeps me going.

19:40.922 --> 19:44.225
You're my
Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon.

19:44.259 --> 19:47.361
As long as I'm with you,
I'm gonna be happy.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.830
So we go to Washington, D.C.

19:49.865 --> 19:51.065
And then we figure out

19:51.099 --> 19:54.268
the next cool and awesome thing
from there, okay?

19:56.905 --> 19:58.539
Okay.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.920
That was a very good
"Being Nice to Someone."

20:01.518 --> 20:02.679
I did it.

20:03.177 --> 20:04.177
I can go finish the show.

out of here, please?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.300
