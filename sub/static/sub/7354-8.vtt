00:01.935 --> 00:04.203
<i>Previously on</i> legends...

00:04.205 --> 00:05.971
At our wedding, we exchanged
vows. Do you remember?

00:05.973 --> 00:07.439
Where's this coming from?

00:07.441 --> 00:09.008
I want to be with you.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.181
Milloy: <i>Prince abboud</i>
<i>of the house of saud.</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:18.017
The prince's classified
itinerary was leaked

00:18.019 --> 00:20.352
<i>From someone</i>
<i>within the state department.</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:21.820
Maggie:
<i>It's hani jibril.</i>

00:21.822 --> 00:24.189
<i>She's a famous activist</i>
<i>for women's rights.</i>

00:24.191 --> 00:26.125
Sebastian egan.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.627
Tony baldwin. We're here
on assignment for <i>joust.</i>

00:28.629 --> 00:30.062
Thank you, aaron,

00:30.064 --> 00:31.196
<i>For taking the risk.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:33.999
Aaron: I'll contact you
with any changes

00:34.001 --> 00:36.502
<i>To the prince's schedule</i>
<i>on this device.</i>

00:36.504 --> 00:38.637
Jibril: <i>I've got something</i>
<i>special planned for the prince.</i>

00:38.639 --> 00:40.305
You said you would champion
suffrage for all women.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.310
(explosion)

00:49.315 --> 00:51.650
This is a very rapidly
developing story.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.485
At this point, we know
authorities have taken

00:53.487 --> 00:55.821
Controversial women's rights
activist hani jibril

00:55.823 --> 00:58.390
Into custody in connection
with the attack.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.359
It's not known if she may have
been working alone

01:00.361 --> 01:01.660
Or with others.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.495
Among the details
we have been able to confirm,

01:03.497 --> 01:04.763
We're told prince abboud

01:04.765 --> 01:06.865
<i>Had just completed a speech</i>
<i>to executives.</i>

01:06.867 --> 01:10.269
â™ª take a walk, look around,
there's a stopper to be found â™ª

01:10.271 --> 01:13.572
â™ª for the heartache

01:15.041 --> 01:16.341
â™ª where the rue,
where the rust â™ª

01:16.343 --> 01:18.444
â™ª there's no promise
you can trust â™ª

01:18.446 --> 01:20.579
â™ª that's the heartache

01:23.349 --> 01:25.851
â™ª it goes bounce

01:25.853 --> 01:27.553
â™ª bounce

01:27.555 --> 01:30.355
â™ª it goes bounce

01:30.357 --> 01:31.857
â™ª bounce

01:32.859 --> 01:34.359
(explosion)

01:43.903 --> 01:46.105
â™ª

01:49.476 --> 01:53.011
â™ª you're no better
than you were â™ª

01:54.080 --> 01:56.348
â™ª you're no better
than you were â™ª

01:58.384 --> 02:02.454
â™ª you're no better than you were
when your heart fell apart â™ª

02:02.456 --> 02:05.791
â™ª and it's broken

02:06.726 --> 02:09.962
â™ª still broken

02:11.564 --> 02:13.632
â™ª because I

02:13.634 --> 02:15.567
â™ª do

02:15.569 --> 02:17.336
â™ª know

02:17.338 --> 02:18.737
â™ª why...

02:18.739 --> 02:20.906
...Armed with a bomb,
flew down and exploded,

02:20.908 --> 02:22.641
Killing the prince instantly.

02:23.776 --> 02:25.477
The scene is a chaotic one,

02:25.479 --> 02:28.914
As witnesses describe near-panic
among participants.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.650
They were running in several
directions at once,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.585
Making it difficult to ascertain
exactly what had happened,

02:33.587 --> 02:35.687
(phone ringing)
and for authorities
to get a handle on the situ...

02:35.689 --> 02:37.122
(mutes tv)

02:37.124 --> 02:38.290
Porter.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.758
Where's my exfil?
On the way.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.760
You'd better be packed and ready
when they get there.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.596
What about money?
Already been wired.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.599
Don't go spending it all on rum
and cuban hookers.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.101
No promises there, sir.

02:49.103 --> 02:51.003
Good luck to you, son.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.437
Thank you for your service.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.173
Yes, sir.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.124
â™ª

03:25.138 --> 03:26.138
It's done.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.639
Thank you.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.737
(elevator bell dings)

03:58.739 --> 04:00.672
Spiller: The director's briefing
the president in 20 minutes.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.174
What do you want me to say?

04:02.176 --> 04:03.609
I know saudi arabia's
a powder keg.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.544
Every middle east
expert is on the news

04:05.546 --> 04:08.513
Predicting another egypt or
syria and a global oil crisis.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.382
And we just tapped
out of two wars.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.017
Look, I'm sorry.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.219
We just can't rule out a
wider terrorist operation.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.922
I'd like to convey some kind
of confidence in our suspect.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.857
Look, I'm not gonna say it just
'cause they want to hear it.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.792
I've had this for
less than three hours.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.028
We're still assessing
hani jibril's involvement.

04:23.030 --> 04:27.266
Look, I think we both know
that this doesn't smell right.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.701
You need to understand
the situation here.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.570
Our people were on the case
when the prince was killed.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.739
We had advance warning
and didn't stop it.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.374
Writing's on the wall.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.575
They're looking at us.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.944
A state department employee
was involved.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.079
Check today's
classified briefing.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.548
No one's ever gonna hear about
aaron rawley's part in this.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.884
Dco is not gonna
take the fall.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.886
Believe me, I sure
as hell can't afford

04:47.888 --> 04:49.087
That kind of exposure.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.722
You're the secret police
in a country

04:50.724 --> 04:52.124
That doesn't have
a secret police.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.458
Look, I don't like
getting grilled

04:53.460 --> 04:55.594
By some congressional hearing
any more than you do.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.663
But we're not gonna
step aside, either.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.797
We don't have
much time.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.766
I'll run cover,

05:00.768 --> 05:04.069
But I want you to find out
who did this and do it fast.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.470
Off book?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.841
No trace.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.080
Rice: Keep going, keep
going, keep going...

05:15.082 --> 05:16.782
Okay, freeze it
right there. Stop.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.483
She's clearly not
doing anything.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.619
Then why did her cell phone have
software to pilot a drone?

05:20.621 --> 05:22.187
That's exactly my point.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.023
How could she be flying
a drone in that moment?

05:25.025 --> 05:27.259
Maybe her phone
was hacked.
If it were, you'd
be able to tell.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.127
Drone could have been
targeting a beacon.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.329
And she accomplished all that

05:30.331 --> 05:31.596
Because she's
such a technical genius?

05:31.598 --> 05:34.633
Either way, someone else had
to be involved.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.268
Maggie:
Someone else?

05:36.270 --> 05:37.602
It's clear that she's
being set up here.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.438
Where are we
on aaron rawley?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.439
He dropped his tail
about 30 minutes

05:40.441 --> 05:41.640
Before the assassination.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.842
And his cell went dark
around the same time.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.711
Dropped his
tail? How?

05:45.713 --> 05:47.979
On foot, in a subway,
according to alpha team.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.348
That couldn't
have been easy, nelson.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.283
We had four units in rotation.

05:51.285 --> 05:53.685
He's either lucky,
or he had training.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.786
Rawley's been
in state department

05:54.788 --> 05:56.955
Bureaucracy for seven years.

05:56.957 --> 06:00.192
Nothing in his personnel file
even hints at covert operative.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.627
Dig into this guy's life,
maggie. Find him fast.

06:02.629 --> 06:03.628
I'm already on it, sir.

06:03.630 --> 06:04.663
Rice: We covered
his apartment

06:04.665 --> 06:05.731
And his office--
there's still

06:05.733 --> 06:07.032
No sign of him.
We're gonna start

06:07.034 --> 06:08.367
Checking hotels
and talking to his friends.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.502
Where's crystal?
At jttf.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.071
Hani jibril's
still being questioned.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.141
Ms. Jibril, we found explosive
residue at your apartment,

06:16.143 --> 06:18.810
That was the same type used
to assassinate prince abboud.

06:18.812 --> 06:19.878
That's not possible.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.546
We can make
a circumstantial case

06:21.548 --> 06:24.149
It's where you armed the drone.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.817
That evidence alone
is enough to convict you.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.587
You need to
talk to us.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.524
Start by explaining that cell
phone you were carrying.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.992
What about it?
I-I don't understand.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.894
How you piloted the drone.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.996
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.232
I didn't kill prince abboud.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.001
I would have died, too, if
it weren't for sebastian egan.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.404
I only wanted to make
a public protest.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.406
And you did. He got the message
loud and clear.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.041
I can't believe
this is happening.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.510
Help yourself
by telling us the truth.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.545
I wish to have
an attorney, please.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.580
That's not gonna happen.
It's my right.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.916
You assassinated a saudi prince
on american soil.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.185
Crystal: You need
to know that

07:00.187 --> 07:02.687
You may be extradited
to saudi arabia to stand trial.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.523
Oh, god. I'm gonna be sick.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.726
Walter, can you
get her some water?

07:07.728 --> 07:09.995
(buzzer sounds)

07:16.536 --> 07:18.804
You didn't know about the phone?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.607
Of course, I didn't know.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.876
A man named aaron rawley
gave it to me.

07:24.878 --> 07:28.079
He said he wanted to help
my cause against the kingdom.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.715
This is because of him.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.319
Please.

07:36.889 --> 07:40.225
Please believe me.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.295
I didn't do this.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.970
I believe you.

07:55.942 --> 07:57.576
(buzzer sounds)

07:57.578 --> 07:59.444
(door opens)

07:59.446 --> 08:01.580
You'll meet your attorney

08:01.582 --> 08:03.682
At the courthouse
before your arraignment.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.484
I'm not guilty
of this crime.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.285
I'm inclined to believe that.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.321
Then why won't
you help me?

08:09.323 --> 08:11.156
We're trying.

08:23.769 --> 08:25.937
Should have known
not to trust a journalist.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.507
I was undercover.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.342
You lied to me.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.311
It wasn't like that, hani.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.113
I don't believe you.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.516
I don't believe
anything you say.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.024
I won't let you burn for this.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.361
I don't believe that
most of all.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.369
(car engine starts)

09:02.675 --> 09:05.143
I'm pissed off, nelson.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.212
Good.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.988
The director and secretary of
state briefed the president.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.823
Officially, he's calling
this a matter of justice.

09:18.825 --> 09:19.991
Unofficially,

09:19.993 --> 09:22.060
He wants hani jibril
permanently silenced.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.429
Obviously, the saudis
are putting pressure on them.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.331
Jibril was a known critic
of the kingdom.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.999
You know,
they're making this political.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.735
Look, as far as they're
concerned, she did it.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.437
I'm telling you, sir,

09:32.439 --> 09:34.506
I looked her
in the eye.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.107
Then get the facts
so we can prove it.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.275
I don't have to tell you

09:37.277 --> 09:38.743
That the political tide
is not in our favor here.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.512
I think I got a lead
on aaron rawley.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.681
He's been dating this girl
off and on for the last year.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.349
She's on the east coast,
but somebody's been using

09:44.351 --> 09:46.885
Her apartment
here in l.A.
Sounds promising.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.588
Maggie:
<i>Martin and rice</i>
<i>are checking it out.</i>

10:22.388 --> 10:24.389
Rice?

10:24.391 --> 10:25.890
In here.

10:26.892 --> 10:28.960
Damn.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.599
Awfully convenient.

10:34.601 --> 10:37.435
No defensive wounds.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.270
Bruising
around the neck.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.806
All consistent
with suicide by hanging.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.341
He's fully dressed, look.

10:44.443 --> 10:45.744
With bare feet.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.579
Meaning what?

10:47.581 --> 10:49.014
Check in between his toes.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.822
Looks like an injection site.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.758
With the right drug,
you can stop the heart.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.794
No one's the wiser.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.663
Staged as a suicide,
case closed.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.731
Most autopsies will miss it.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.934
You mind if I ask you
how you know that?

11:10.803 --> 11:12.303
Just do.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.173
You're what my wife calls
a poor communicator.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.614
"I only wanted
to help hani jibril.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.282
"I didn't know she would
assassinate prince abboud.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.650
"I let my
country down.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.118
"I can't live with myself,

11:27.120 --> 11:28.853
Knowing what I was
responsible for."

11:30.656 --> 11:32.691
Typed and unsigned.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.459
As send-offs go,

11:34.461 --> 11:36.528
Not terribly convincing.

11:40.032 --> 11:43.501
I agree.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.738
I have a briefing
this afternoon with dhs.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.473
The ntas has just issued an

11:48.475 --> 11:49.808
Elevated threat alert.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.911
I mean, all 56 fbi field
offices are mobilizing.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.813
They'll cast a wide net,

11:54.815 --> 11:57.816
Catch nothing,
then hang it all on hani jibril.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.317
Or they may blame it all on us.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.919
The attorney general's
office

12:00.921 --> 12:03.154
Is ordering us
to turn over all files

12:03.156 --> 12:04.422
On this case.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.658
God, I'm so sick of
this shit, martin.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.494
I'm sorry, but as an fbi agent,
we're supposed to

12:09.496 --> 12:12.263
Follow the rules, right?
I was taught

12:12.265 --> 12:13.832
To believe in the law.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.334
The academy didn't cover
what to do when

12:16.336 --> 12:19.170
People start twisting
the law to support an injustice.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.173
That's why I don't pay attention
to the rules too much.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.942
(chuckles)

12:28.514 --> 12:29.781
Where are you going?

12:29.783 --> 12:33.818
Spiller's office.
Meeting with state.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.254
(muted)

12:37.189 --> 12:38.590
Reporter:
...Just moments ago,

12:38.592 --> 12:41.226
Where prince fayeen released a
statement condemning the murder

12:41.228 --> 12:43.027
Of his cousin by hani jibril,

12:43.029 --> 12:46.030
Whom he called a feminist
radical and a danger to islam.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.266
Well, fayeen will use her
to roll back everything

12:48.268 --> 12:49.634
Abboud has been
trying to reform.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.202
Sounds like motive to me.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.738
You know, we have to be
careful here, martin.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.640
There are a million eyes on us.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.309
And we can't control
what the truth is anymore,

12:58.311 --> 13:00.979
Whether or not it's gonna
line up for or against fayeen.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.614
Hani jibril
knows the truth.

13:02.616 --> 13:06.551
As long as she's alive,
she represents a threat.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.320
You know as well as I--
they're not gonna let her live.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.389
They meant to kill her
yesterday along with the prince.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.458
She's an inconvenient truth.

13:14.593 --> 13:15.894
Crystal:
<i>You're prepared</i>

13:15.896 --> 13:17.796
To let an innocent woman
hang for this?

13:17.798 --> 13:20.565
There are bigger stakes
to consider here, agent mcguire.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.800
Maybe that sounds
callous to you,

13:21.802 --> 13:24.569
But this is the kind of spark
that can ignite a war.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.070
We are treading
carefully.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.806
Try seeing it as
a necessary sacrifice

13:27.808 --> 13:29.140
That could save many lives.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.909
I'm afraid I don't.
Crystal: Just to be clear--

13:30.911 --> 13:33.578
You're gonna ignore aaron
rawley's involvement in this?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.980
Mr. Rawley's connection
to the case will be suppressed

13:35.982 --> 13:38.817
Per national security
directive 947-3.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.419
What do you think the fallout
would be if we revealed

13:41.421 --> 13:43.855
A state department
employee was involved?

13:43.857 --> 13:46.925
He was involved.
The saudis are a
key strategic ally.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.427
We're trying to mitigate a
major diplomatic crisis here.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.762
You're covering it up.

13:50.764 --> 13:51.930
What do you think's
gonna happen

13:51.932 --> 13:54.532
If you lay all this
on hani jibril?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.768
You understand things work
a little differently in riyadh?

13:56.770 --> 13:58.770
We've evaluated the situation.

13:58.772 --> 14:01.206
I transferred into dco
from the middle east division.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.774
I know what's gonna happen:

14:02.776 --> 14:05.610
You will make female activists
like her into targets.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.778
No one's gonna be waiting
for a verdict.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.847
Thank you, agent. We've
noted the objection.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.515
This could destabilize
the saudi monarchy,

14:10.517 --> 14:14.118
Oil prices, entire
economies around the world.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.788
Hani jibril assassinated
prince abboud.

14:16.790 --> 14:19.524
Now you can either get
on message, or the dco

14:19.526 --> 14:22.627
Can shoulder the responsibility
for the operational failure

14:22.629 --> 14:24.896
That led to
prince abboud's death.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.631
Man:
I want to remind you,
agent mcguire.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.800
The matter regarding
hani jibril has been classified

14:28.802 --> 14:31.903
For reasons
of national security.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.972
Are we clear?

14:36.475 --> 14:38.877
We don't need you
to be okay with this.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.213
Good.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.782
Because I'm not.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.926
Rice:
<i>Jibril was a known</i>

14:54.928 --> 14:57.095
Critic of the house of saud.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.763
As far as they're
concerned, she did it.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.565
And I think everyone
else is gonna buy that story.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.433
Now, we know that
aaron rawley set her up.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.835
What was rawley's motive, then?

15:03.837 --> 15:05.003
That's the missing piece.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.838
So now do we think that rawley

15:06.840 --> 15:08.273
Was working for
the house of saud?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.241
Or was it someone else that was
trying to get prince abboud

15:10.243 --> 15:12.844
Out of the way?
I think I might know who.

15:12.846 --> 15:16.180
Before aaron rawley joined
the state department,

15:16.182 --> 15:17.248
He worked briefly

15:17.250 --> 15:18.616
For an american
oil company that had

15:18.618 --> 15:21.619
A huge contract for
saudi oil blocks.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.188
Couple of months ago,
arcadia bought that company.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.090
And right after the
sale, prince abboud

15:26.092 --> 15:28.626
Handed the rights to a
saudi company instead.
Then why

15:28.628 --> 15:30.295
Did the prince
meet with arcadia?
Negotiating

15:30.297 --> 15:31.362
A settlement would be my guess.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.531
Arcadia wanted the oil rights--

15:33.533 --> 15:34.866
Abboud had
to be removed.

15:34.868 --> 15:37.368
That's a start. What's the rest?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.304
There's the problem.
Their cybersecurity

15:39.306 --> 15:41.372
Is about as airtight as the nsa.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.440
But there's gotta be
some type of way.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.442
There's always a way.
It just depends

15:44.444 --> 15:46.544
On how much "way"
you can handle.

15:48.647 --> 15:51.115
There's a spyware program
that I've used before.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.284
It could open a back door
in arcadia's firewall,

15:53.286 --> 15:54.719
Give me
remote access.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.387
That's not a bad idea.
But we

15:56.389 --> 15:57.822
Don't have a warrant.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.124
Well, it's not a bad idea
if you don't get caught.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.960
After my meeting
with milloy...

16:01.962 --> 16:04.028
Maggie, you can't get caught
trying to steal data.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.572
Security guard:
Look into the camera, please.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.241
(beeping)

16:17.243 --> 16:18.343
(shutter clicks)
okay.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.517
Ms. Harris?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.920
Yes, I'm agent harris.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.688
We spoke on the phone.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.657
Tim crosley, head
of data security.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.659
Right. Hi.
I thought the fbi had already

16:34.661 --> 16:36.928
Collected all the video
surveillance from the attack.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.296
They did. We did.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.764
But we found a glitch.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.366
A glitch?
It's probably nothing, but

16:41.368 --> 16:42.934
I just need to check
the backup server,

16:42.936 --> 16:44.268
Make sure no one
tampered with it.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.603
There's no way someone
could've done that.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.405
I know.
But we need to be thorough.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.042
I don't know
if you saw the addendum

16:51.044 --> 16:52.510
To the subpoena
that I sent over.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.112
Addendum, no.
No?

16:54.114 --> 16:56.547
I'm sorry, I thought I sent it.
Here's a scan of it.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.684
It's kind of hard to make out
the judge's signature, but...

17:01.453 --> 17:02.754
Follow me.

17:05.791 --> 17:08.359
Only arcadia employees
have clearance

17:08.361 --> 17:09.861
To access the mainframe.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.729
Of course, I get it.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.731
Um, maybe you
can do it for me?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.133
What's the timecode?

17:15.135 --> 17:17.969
Um... 15:05 to 15:09.

17:17.971 --> 17:19.370
Sometimes the

17:19.372 --> 17:22.206
Glitch, as you call it, is just
an error in the data transfer.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.808
That's what
I told them, but

17:23.810 --> 17:25.376
You know how they are.
Yeah,

17:25.378 --> 17:27.211
I'm not seeing it.
Good. I knew

17:27.213 --> 17:28.646
It was nothing.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.182
Um, I actually need
to download the data again

17:31.184 --> 17:32.717
So that our forensics
can study it.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.218
Do you mind?

17:35.988 --> 17:38.156
I just need the four or five
minutes around that, and

17:38.158 --> 17:40.491
I will be out of your hair.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.060
Yeah.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.700
Thank you so much for your help.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.503
(keyboard keys clacking)

17:52.505 --> 17:54.038
(elevator bell dings)

17:54.040 --> 17:56.174
Hey. I need to talk to you
and you're probably

17:56.176 --> 17:57.608
Gonna be mad when I tell you.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.043
Then I definitely
don't want to hear it.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.711
But it's a big deal.
Then what?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.346
You promise you
won't get mad?
Maggie.

18:02.348 --> 18:05.349
All right, you know how I told
you I was gonna use the spyware

18:05.351 --> 18:07.085
On arcadia's mainframe
so I could access

18:07.087 --> 18:08.586
Their highly secure
and protected network?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.855
Yes.
All right, well, it turns out

18:10.857 --> 18:13.624
That the firewall was a
little tough to get around.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.126
So you didn't get anything.

18:15.128 --> 18:18.196
No, I did. I just had to do
it from inside the building.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.031
Inside?

18:22.701 --> 18:24.469
You broke into arcadia?

18:25.571 --> 18:27.205
I did it based on my convictions

18:27.207 --> 18:28.706
That hani jibril is innocent.

18:28.708 --> 18:32.310
And, news flash-- dco's ass
is on the line with this case,

18:32.312 --> 18:33.377
Okay?

18:33.379 --> 18:35.046
And I would do it again.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.216
Am I in trouble?

18:38.218 --> 18:40.651
It all depends on what you got.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.387
I pulled this off the
mainframe at arcadia.

18:43.389 --> 18:47.558
The coo carefully documented a
series of wire transfers to him

18:47.560 --> 18:50.228
From a front company that's
linked to prince fayeen.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.662
He's also got detailed
disbursement schedules

18:51.664 --> 18:54.599
For payouts to aaron rawley
and operational funds

18:54.601 --> 18:56.567
For ahmed hassan. It
goes back over a year.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.636
So aaron rawley was
a mole for arcadia

18:58.638 --> 19:00.404
Operating inside
the state department.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.639
They're running a full-fledged
covert operation

19:01.641 --> 19:03.741
To secure oil rights.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.844
Porter keep all this
as an insurance policy?
That'd be my guess.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.013
In case prince fayeen tried
to throw him under the bus.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.748
It's smoking gun
evidence.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.283
Prince fayeen
conspired with arcadia

19:12.285 --> 19:13.684
To assassinate prince abboud.

19:13.686 --> 19:14.919
Where'd you get all this?

19:14.921 --> 19:16.921
Maggie:
I'd rather not say, sir.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.990
So I'll assume the evidence
was obtained illegally.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.424
Which makes all of it

19:20.426 --> 19:22.260
Inadmissible in court,
whether it's true

19:22.262 --> 19:23.594
Or not.
Prince fayeen is

19:23.596 --> 19:24.862
One of the wealthiest men
in the world.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.430
Thinks he's above the law.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.866
Well, the reality is,
is that he <i>is</i> above the law.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.768
We can't do this legitimately.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.103
But we can play politics, too.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.671
Sebastian egan

19:33.673 --> 19:35.773
Can write a series
of articles.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.376
It'll be a massive scandal
for the prince.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.045
Do you think <i>joust</i> magazine
can handle something this big?

19:41.047 --> 19:43.314
Well, their editor's kept
the sebastian egan legend

19:43.316 --> 19:45.316
Alive for years.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.018
It's the kind of story
he lives for.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.120
So we publish the article,
embarrass fayeen,

19:49.122 --> 19:51.789
And we're still on the brink
of an international crisis.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.025
And it's not gonna
free hani jibril.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.860
Rice:
We'd have to catch prince fayeen
doing something...

19:55.862 --> 19:57.862
Illegal.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.130
Exactly.

19:59.132 --> 20:00.231
So what's the plan?

20:00.233 --> 20:02.700
Make prince fayeen try
to kill me.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.205
(laughs)

20:11.543 --> 20:13.878
â™ª

20:13.880 --> 20:15.980
Man:
Well, no, I...

20:15.982 --> 20:18.149
I really don't care that you
have no comment, your honor.

20:18.151 --> 20:21.085
You consistently
sentence minors to

20:21.087 --> 20:22.253
A private
detention center...

20:23.922 --> 20:26.157
You consistently
sentence them there--

20:26.159 --> 20:28.559
To a center in which
you have a financial stake,

20:28.561 --> 20:30.861
So, I'm sorry, but
we're running this story

20:30.863 --> 20:33.664
Whether you comment
or not. Mm-hmm.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.867
(dial tone drones)
and... He hung up on me.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.170
Still wearing a bull's-eye
on your forehead, I see.

20:39.172 --> 20:41.172
Well, if I wasn't pissing people
off, I wouldn't be doing my job,

20:41.174 --> 20:43.407
Would I?

20:43.409 --> 20:44.942
It's good to see you, sebastian.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.712
And you too, julian.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.982
Now hurry and pour me a bloody
drink before I die of thirst.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.352
I need your help, julian.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.853
Oh, and here it comes.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.089
You know the deal.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.624
I give you solid tips,

20:59.626 --> 21:01.359
You write articles in my name.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.194
I'm not one of your
criminal informants.

21:03.196 --> 21:04.295
And I don't really
like working

21:04.297 --> 21:05.596
Hand in hand with the fbi.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.031
It tends to invalidate

21:07.033 --> 21:08.299
My credibility as a journalist.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.533
You're the only
person outside

21:09.535 --> 21:11.902
The fbi that knows
that sebastian egan

21:11.904 --> 21:13.371
Is really an undercover agent.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.372
But it's the principle.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.873
I'm not a pawn of
law enforcement.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.309
No. You're an angry rebel

21:18.311 --> 21:20.044
Who runs a popular magazine.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.614
Who, by the way, has profited
extensively from my info.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.050
Okay, now you're being a jerk.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.419
Well, see if you still
think I'm a jerk

21:28.421 --> 21:30.054
After I give you this.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.222
What? Let's see, last year,

21:31.224 --> 21:33.057
You gave me a rabbit.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.558
The year before you gave me
a live grenade.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.928
So... The jerk
thing didn't end.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.230
I'm about to give you

21:39.232 --> 21:41.899
The story of a lifetime,
my friend.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.668
What are you into?

21:43.670 --> 21:46.337
You've been following
the hani jibril case?

21:46.339 --> 21:47.905
I have.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.574
It's hard to believe that

21:50.576 --> 21:53.010
She'd kill anyone,
let alone a prince.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.478
She didn't.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.080
I'm listening.
There's a lot more

21:56.082 --> 21:58.749
To the prince abboud story
than you realize.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.252
I want to publish
a couple of exposÃ© articles

22:01.254 --> 22:03.254
Written by sebastian egan

22:03.256 --> 22:05.323
That proves prince fayeen
conspired to kill abboud,

22:05.325 --> 22:08.025
And intended to kill
hani jibril as well.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.760
Are you serious?

22:09.762 --> 22:11.829
Damn right I'm serious.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.166
<i>Prince fayeen was jealous</i>
<i>of his cousin abboud,</i>

22:15.168 --> 22:18.369
<i>Who was not only the dashing,</i>
<i>young, progressive face</i>

22:18.371 --> 22:20.338
<i>Of modern saudi arabia;</i>

22:20.340 --> 22:22.873
He also represented change.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.042
<i>Few people knew that abboud</i>

22:25.044 --> 22:26.777
<i>Was secretly working</i>
<i>to give women the right</i>

22:26.779 --> 22:28.779
<i>To vote in saudi arabia.</i>

22:28.781 --> 22:31.515
Now, hani jibril confronted him
<i>about it earlier this year,</i>

22:31.517 --> 22:33.818
<i>And he promised her</i>
<i>he'd push for suffrage</i>

22:33.820 --> 22:35.219
<i>Inside the kingdom.</i>

22:35.221 --> 22:37.555
Just think about
if he'd done that.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.956
Women voting in saudi arabia--

22:38.958 --> 22:40.791
That would be
revolutionary.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.793
It's a... Total power shift.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.061
It'd certainly guarantee

22:44.063 --> 22:45.329
Abboud's murder.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.331
But he hadn't moved
on that, so...

22:47.333 --> 22:49.200
The real question
is, who knew?

22:49.202 --> 22:50.968
Oh, prince fayeen knew.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.504
<i>He's a hard-liner</i>
<i>who stands with the old guard.</i>

22:53.506 --> 22:55.239
<i>He can't stomach</i>
<i>the thought of women</i>

22:55.241 --> 22:57.975
<i>Having equality in saudi</i>
<i>arabia-- that's part of it.</i>

22:57.977 --> 23:00.144
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>prince abboud</i>

23:00.146 --> 23:03.247
<i>Is the putative successor</i>
<i>to the saudi throne.</i>

23:03.249 --> 23:04.815
So in order
for fayeen

23:04.817 --> 23:05.983
To take the title,

23:05.985 --> 23:07.651
He needed abboud
out of his way.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.687
He took his shot
in los angeles.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.355
<i>The arcadia policy council</i>

23:11.357 --> 23:13.758
<i>Stood to make billions</i>
<i>on a lucrative oil contract.</i>

23:13.760 --> 23:16.494
<i>That is, until abboud</i>
<i>awarded the contract</i>

23:16.496 --> 23:17.928
To a saudi
company instead.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.231
<i>Fayeen told arcadia</i>
<i>he would give them the contract</i>

23:20.233 --> 23:21.766
<i>Once he seized power</i>

23:21.768 --> 23:24.001
<i>And became oil minister.</i>
<i>Price was...</i>

23:24.003 --> 23:26.370
<i>The assassination</i>
<i>of his cousin.</i>

23:26.372 --> 23:28.773
Arcadia came up
with the plan.

23:28.775 --> 23:29.874
And hani jibril

23:29.876 --> 23:32.176
<i>Was the perfect scapegoat.</i>

23:32.178 --> 23:33.844
<i>Prince fayeen and arcadia knew</i>

23:33.846 --> 23:35.413
<i>She wouldn't miss</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

23:35.415 --> 23:37.548
<i>To confront abboud</i>
<i>on american television,</i>

23:37.550 --> 23:40.551
<i>Put him on the spot,</i>
<i>forcing him to publicly commit</i>

23:40.553 --> 23:42.420
<i>To the promise</i>
<i>he'd made to her.</i>

23:43.588 --> 23:44.855
(explosion)

23:44.857 --> 23:46.524
<i>And now...</i>

23:46.526 --> 23:49.160
<i>Well, now she's being framed</i>
<i>for abboud's murder.</i>

23:50.295 --> 23:52.196
<i>Can you back any of this up?</i>

23:52.198 --> 23:55.032
I wouldn't be here
if I couldn't.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.101
I mean, sebastian, this...

23:57.103 --> 23:59.937
This is the kind of story
that ends governments.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.907
Yes.

24:02.909 --> 24:06.477
And it'd be an exclusive
for <i>joust</i> magazine.
Okay, you know

24:06.479 --> 24:09.713
The house of saud does
not take kindly to criticism.

24:09.715 --> 24:13.083
And you understand
that by telling this story...

24:13.085 --> 24:15.286
You could get yourself killed.

24:19.224 --> 24:22.293
Or is that the idea?

24:22.295 --> 24:24.562
Let's give the dragon a poke.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.931
Publish the first article,

24:26.933 --> 24:29.433
See if they'll come after me.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.901
We talked about this.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.103
You knew there
would be news coverage.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.206
This isn't news coverage--
it's a hit job!

24:36.408 --> 24:37.741
It's embarrassing!

24:37.743 --> 24:39.944
I read the article--
our name's in there, too,

24:39.946 --> 24:41.245
Your highness.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.247
This reporter's just citing
anonymous sources.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.850
The article says they have
more information to publish.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.852
They say that
with the next article

24:47.854 --> 24:50.087
They will reveal a smoking gun.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.689
You have to intervene,
mr. Porter.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.190
This isn't saudi arabia.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.125
You can't muzzle
journalists here.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.828
That just makes things worse.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.697
Call your publicist.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.800
Fine. If you can't handle this,
then I will.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.102
I think that's an excellent
idea, your highness.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.171
(phone beeps off)

25:14.513 --> 25:15.946
So, two networks
are calling,

25:15.948 --> 25:17.681
Wanting to interview you
for their morning shows.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.284
Too dangerous to put my face
out there, don't you think?

25:20.286 --> 25:21.819
Man:
I can't leave
for a minute

25:21.821 --> 25:23.988
Without you making trouble.
(laughs)

25:23.990 --> 25:26.123
Hey, you want to talk trouble,
blame this guy.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.125
Sebastian egan,
this is faris nadir.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.060
Faris is with
cnb world service.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.462
He's covered the house of saud
for many years.

25:31.464 --> 25:33.964
And you need no introduction,
mr. Egan.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.333
Congratulations
on the piece.
Thank you.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.635
How do you guys know each other?

25:37.637 --> 25:38.836
We met back in egypt

25:38.838 --> 25:40.905
When I was just a stringer.
We've been

25:40.907 --> 25:42.139
In a few tight spots together.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.007
(chuckles)

25:43.009 --> 25:45.543
Can we talk?

25:46.578 --> 25:48.145
Nadir:
<i>I don't have to tell</i>

25:48.147 --> 25:50.848
Either one of you this,
but you need to tread lightly.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.083
We're taking precautions,
so you don't have to worry.

25:53.085 --> 25:56.520
You have a very
dangerous and powerful
adversary, mr. Egan.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.423
This isn't going after
nixon or mugabe.

25:59.425 --> 26:02.326
Prince fayeen believes
he's a vessel of allah,

26:02.328 --> 26:05.095
And who happens
to be one of the ten
richest people on earth.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.664
You've got a tiger by the tail.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.166
I'm telling you this
as one journalist to another.

26:09.168 --> 26:12.169
Well, journalism
isn't supposed to be easy.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.104
Or safe.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.940
Principled, a bit.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.175
I have a highly placed source

26:18.177 --> 26:20.210
In saudi intelligence
who tells me

26:20.212 --> 26:22.179
There will be an attempt
on your life, mr. Egan.

26:22.181 --> 26:26.250
This from a credible source
within the gip.

26:28.119 --> 26:32.289
I appreciate the warning,
but we are aware of the risk.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.359
Fayeen is determined
to suppress this reporting.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.061
He's very powerful,

26:37.063 --> 26:40.230
And with many proxies he can use
as plausible deniability.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.765
This is serious.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.402
I just wanted
to make sure

26:45.404 --> 26:49.540
You took full measure
of the danger.

26:49.542 --> 26:52.810
Sometimes there are stories
better left untold.

27:00.885 --> 27:03.621
Faris nadir--
he was born in dubai

27:03.623 --> 27:05.623
To a wealthy family
in the oil business.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.157
Educated at oxford.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.960
And he's been working
for cnb since the '90s.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.662
He went to boarding school
with prince fayeen,

27:11.664 --> 27:13.063
So he was sending a message

27:13.065 --> 27:14.898
Through his old buddy.
A warning, yeah?

27:14.900 --> 27:16.333
A threat.
Yeah, it means

27:16.335 --> 27:17.668
You're getting under his skin.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.638
Gates (over speaker): Martin,
crystal, in my office now.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.851
I'm sure you've seen this.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.655
Oh.

27:39.591 --> 27:42.026
Fine piece of
journalism, I thought.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.460
It's created
a diplomatic shitstorm

27:43.462 --> 27:44.595
For the state department.

27:44.597 --> 27:47.031
I just spent the last hour
being threatened

27:47.033 --> 27:48.532
With sanctions
by the saudi ambassador.

27:48.534 --> 27:52.336
The article cites evidence about
the detonator used in the bomb

27:52.338 --> 27:54.038
That killed
prince abboud.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.472
Evidence that could only come

27:55.474 --> 27:56.940
From someone
inside the investigation.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.842
Sounds like a reporter

27:58.844 --> 28:00.477
(chuckles):
Who values his privacy to me.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.881
Undercover or not,
you leaked classified
information.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.716
There will be
criminal charges filed.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.284
That I can promise you.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.952
Need I remind you, agent milloy,

28:08.954 --> 28:11.121
That the sebastian egan
legend

28:11.123 --> 28:13.023
Is covered under
the intelligence identities

28:13.025 --> 28:16.060
Protection act.
Crystal: Which means
you can't reveal that martin

28:16.062 --> 28:18.395
Is sebastian egan.
And there's

28:18.397 --> 28:19.963
That pesky first amendment.

28:19.965 --> 28:21.799
Oh, I've already got
attorneys at justice

28:21.801 --> 28:23.967
Working on a motion to compel,
trust me.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.307
This plan of yours better work.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.975
Martin: We've got
the saudis interested.

28:31.977 --> 28:34.344
We just have to set the hook.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.647
(car door opens, closes)

28:36.649 --> 28:38.315
(car alarm chirps)

28:39.884 --> 28:42.453
(whispers):
Faris. Over here.

28:44.422 --> 28:46.323
â™ª

28:47.325 --> 28:49.326
Where's drake?

28:49.328 --> 28:50.994
I don't know-- he
should have been here.

28:50.996 --> 28:53.430
Sorry for
the cloak-and-dagger routine.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.734
(engine starting nearby)
sebastian, a-are you okay?

28:56.736 --> 28:59.069
You were right about that tiger.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.839
He doesn't like it
when you grab his tail.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.174
(engine accelerating,
tires squealing)

29:04.176 --> 29:05.843
(vehicle departing)

29:05.845 --> 29:07.911
You didn't see any cameras
on your way, did you?

29:07.913 --> 29:10.347
No.
I scouted, but...

29:10.349 --> 29:12.349
I just wanted to double-check.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.351
I'm bloody paranoid these days.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.286
You don't have
a cell, right?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.288
I left it,
just as you asked.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.191
They can listen in with a
microphone when it's
switched on, you know?

29:21.193 --> 29:22.793
Look, um...

29:22.795 --> 29:25.429
You don't mind
if I pat you down, do you?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.298
I... Do apologize.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.634
Just can't take
any chances.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.636
It's like a bloody
kafka novel.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.772
What's going on?

29:34.774 --> 29:36.707
I've got hard proof

29:36.709 --> 29:39.943
That prince fayeen conspired
with the arcadia policy council

29:39.945 --> 29:42.713
To assassinate
prince abboud.

29:42.715 --> 29:44.148
Hard proof?

29:44.150 --> 29:45.916
It's all on here.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.752
Bank transfers
connecting fayeen to arcadia.

29:48.754 --> 29:50.721
Just follow the money.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.222
It's the smoking gun,
as it were.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.792
Look... I want you
to run with this

29:54.794 --> 29:57.795
If anything
happens to me.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.831
Why are you
trusting me with this?

30:00.833 --> 30:02.399
Drake trusts you;

30:02.401 --> 30:04.468
I trust drake.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.571
Don't worry, you're not
the only one I've given it to.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.072
Other journalists?

30:09.074 --> 30:12.075
Oh, you don't really want
to know that, do you?

30:12.077 --> 30:14.344
No, I suppose not.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.346
Hey, wait till you see
what's on the drive.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.348
I've got them dead to rights.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.017
Monday the story drops--
that's when

30:20.019 --> 30:21.518
We publish.
Three days.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.187
Where are you until then?

30:23.189 --> 30:25.923
Down a very dark
rabbit hole, my friend.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.091
I've got to fly
to san francisco

30:28.093 --> 30:29.593
Tomorrow morning for
one last interview.

30:29.595 --> 30:32.095
Button this up.
Fly back tomorrow night.

30:32.097 --> 30:33.597
Be careful, sebastian.

30:33.599 --> 30:34.865
I know.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.166
You're not flying commercial,
are you?

30:36.168 --> 30:39.570
Don't worry, I'm, uh...
I use an alias.

30:42.273 --> 30:44.341
(car alarm chirps)

30:46.377 --> 30:49.046
(knocks)
you got a second?

30:49.048 --> 30:50.881
Have a seat.

30:55.119 --> 30:56.920
I don't know how to say this.

30:58.556 --> 31:01.725
I've been digging
into martin's life.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.628
On martin's orders?

31:04.630 --> 31:07.798
On my own.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.367
And what I found was strange.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.704
According to his file,
he was in the hospital

31:13.706 --> 31:15.005
<i>After a car accident in 2004.</i>

31:15.007 --> 31:16.707
But when martin
called gates

31:16.709 --> 31:19.476
<i>From houston, he said</i>
<i>he thought he was in iraq</i>

31:19.478 --> 31:22.312
<i>At that time.</i>
<i>It was around February, 2004.</i>

31:22.314 --> 31:24.448
Nelson, I think I was there.

31:31.856 --> 31:33.757
What do you mean?

31:33.759 --> 31:35.826
It's like his whole
life is a fabrication.

31:35.828 --> 31:37.828
Before 2004,

31:37.830 --> 31:41.398
Every assignment he had,
it's impossible to source it.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.867
Every contact
listed

31:43.869 --> 31:45.502
Was either dead
or I couldn't find them,

31:45.504 --> 31:48.338
And if I can't find them,
then they don't exist.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.174
When I cross-referenced
martin's birth record,

31:51.176 --> 31:54.511
School history, service reports
with his personnel file,

31:54.513 --> 31:56.213
I found small discrepancies.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.282
What are you saying?

31:59.684 --> 32:01.685
I'm saying that...

32:01.687 --> 32:04.421
I think something's
being covered up here.

32:04.423 --> 32:09.059
If I were to construct a legend
for a dco agent,

32:09.061 --> 32:12.496
It would look a lot like
martin's life.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.901
Let me figure out
how to deal with this.

32:17.903 --> 32:20.137
For now, keep
it between us.

32:24.575 --> 32:25.876
I've engaged our communications
firm to start spinning

32:25.878 --> 32:28.045
The transfer of funds
as consulting fees,

32:28.047 --> 32:30.047
Part of the larger
protection deal.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.649
I'm not interested
in spin doctors, mr. Porter.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.619
I'm interested in preventing
the release of this information.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.621
Faris told us
that egan has given the evidence

32:37.623 --> 32:39.323
To several other sources.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.558
Even if we kill him,
the story will get out.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.126
We just need
to have a few words

32:43.128 --> 32:44.795
With mr. Egan, convince him
that publication

32:44.797 --> 32:46.330
Is not in his best interest.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.597
What if you let him go

32:47.599 --> 32:50.267
And he writes
about how you roughed him up?

32:50.269 --> 32:52.302
That's fuel on the fire.
Mr. Egan

32:52.304 --> 32:54.571
Won't be in the mood to write
anything once I have finished.

32:54.573 --> 32:55.839
How are you gonna find him?

32:55.841 --> 32:57.407
We know egan is traveling back

32:57.409 --> 32:59.309
To los angeles under an alias.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.913
A mr. George holden.
I am confident that he can be...

33:02.915 --> 33:04.414
Persuaded to drop the story.

33:04.416 --> 33:07.584
We must stop this information
from getting out.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.921
Gates:
So you'll pretend to
arrive back in l.A.

33:10.923 --> 33:13.423
From san francisco. And sometime
within the next 24 hours...

33:13.425 --> 33:15.025
Martin:
I'll be kidnapped.

33:16.094 --> 33:17.361
Well, that's the hope.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.863
The fbi tac team will
be there to rescue you.

33:19.865 --> 33:21.598
Then we're gonna
start flipping.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.100
What if they're just assassins?

33:23.102 --> 33:24.267
They'll want
to find out

33:24.269 --> 33:27.204
Who I gave the
intelligence to first.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.705
I don't expect they'll kill me.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.841
At least not straightaway.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.076
Thank you.

33:34.045 --> 33:35.278
There are
a lot of ways

33:35.280 --> 33:36.680
For this to go wrong.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.115
Unless we can get
abboud's assassin,

33:38.117 --> 33:41.618
All we have is circumstantial
evidence that will be

33:41.620 --> 33:44.121
Lawyered away. Don't
worry. I'll be fine.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.123
I'll have on kevlar, of course.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.792
And with this,
I'm sure I'll be easy

33:48.794 --> 33:50.127
To keep track of.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.628
Maggie:
We read you, martin.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.397
There you are.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.607
(indistinct chatter)

34:10.815 --> 34:12.816
Gates:
Audio and video
feeds are up.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.718
We have
eyes and ears.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.387
Copy that. We
got eyes, too.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.889
We got his back.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.223
Looks like I'm your guy.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.825
George holden.

34:21.827 --> 34:22.826
Hi. Bashir.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.761
Hi.
Allow me to take your bags.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.930
Oh, thank you.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.598
Follow me, please.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.000
Maggie, you got this?

34:30.002 --> 34:33.336
Mm-hmm. I'm running
facial recognition now.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.672
It's just right
over here.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.574
We have a positive I.D.
On the suspect.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.509
Bashir al-kanazer.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.412
He's a syrian national
on the terror watch list.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.114
I'll alert martin.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.124
(phone beeps)

34:54.126 --> 34:55.792
It's like a digital leash.

34:55.794 --> 34:58.161
Throw it in the bloody river
one day. (chuckles)

35:02.200 --> 35:03.200
Ah.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.435
Thank you.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.609
You, uh... You have
where I'm going?

35:12.611 --> 35:15.212
The offices of <i>joust</i>
<i>magazine in santa monica.</i>

35:15.214 --> 35:16.313
You got it.

35:17.715 --> 35:19.483
Crystal:
<i>Martin and the suspect</i>
<i>are on the move.</i>

35:21.219 --> 35:23.053
(engine starting)

35:27.291 --> 35:28.558
We're on the limo.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.328
Heading north out of lax
onto world way.

35:33.564 --> 35:35.499
Suspect heading north

35:35.501 --> 35:37.334
On sepulveda.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.679
(tires screeching)

35:49.681 --> 35:50.747
Rice:
Wait a minute, what's he doing?

35:50.749 --> 35:52.415
There's no way he spotted us.

35:52.417 --> 35:53.483
Where are you going?

35:53.485 --> 35:56.153
A shortcut to the freeway.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.256
Let's pull over.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.495
Maggie, where is he?

36:05.497 --> 36:06.596
He just turned right

36:06.598 --> 36:08.198
On manchester.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.000
He's making another right
on truxton.

36:10.002 --> 36:11.601
He's making deliberate turns.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.103
It's
a countersurveillance pattern.

36:13.105 --> 36:14.704
He's looking for a tail.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.106
Rice:
<i>All right, we're just gonna</i>

36:16.108 --> 36:17.941
Wait here.
Maggie:
Why are you stopping?

36:17.943 --> 36:20.043
He's checking to see
if he's being followed.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.111
Trust me.

36:21.113 --> 36:23.180
(tires squealing)

36:24.782 --> 36:27.217
Maggie:
Okay, he turned right on 87th,

36:27.219 --> 36:29.619
Left on sepulveda
east way.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.122
He's turning right
on la tijera.

36:32.124 --> 36:34.057
He's going in a circle.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.959
Okay, he's turning right
on sepulveda again.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.360
You should see him any second.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.562
(tires screech)

36:43.134 --> 36:46.069
It was a good call.

36:48.139 --> 36:50.307
I thought you said
we were taking a shortcut.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.509
Uh, sorry. Uh,
wrong street.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.811
I was confused.
Oh.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.813
That's reassuring.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.882
Don't worry. We
will be there soon.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.217
Right.

37:00.219 --> 37:01.651
They're stopped at the corner
of sepulveda

37:01.653 --> 37:02.986
And el camino.

37:02.988 --> 37:04.955
Yeah, we got him.
It's a red light.

37:09.093 --> 37:10.160
What is he doing?

37:11.329 --> 37:12.729
(tires screeching)

37:12.731 --> 37:13.897
Shit, he's running the red.

37:13.899 --> 37:17.000
(horn honking)
(tires screeching)

37:17.002 --> 37:18.501
Crystal:
<i>Maggie, don't lose him.</i>

37:18.503 --> 37:19.836
(tires screech)

37:19.838 --> 37:21.671
They turned right on 74th.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.772
Hold on.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.441
(engine revving)
(tires screeching)

37:24.443 --> 37:26.176
(horn honks)

37:26.178 --> 37:27.911
Maggie.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.112
(tires screech)

37:29.114 --> 37:30.847
They turned left on naylor.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.282
Crystal:
<i>We're 30 seconds out.</i>

37:45.596 --> 37:47.664
(mechanical whirring)

37:51.035 --> 37:53.103
(sighs)

37:59.110 --> 38:00.710
Maggie, what happened?
Where is he?

38:00.712 --> 38:02.612
The signal's gone.
Well, get it back.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.114
What's going on?

38:04.116 --> 38:05.548
We lost the signal on naylor.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.617
<i>Get up there now.</i>

38:16.961 --> 38:19.296
The limo's gone.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.997
Maggie, where is he?

38:20.999 --> 38:23.833
Find him.
I don't have the
signal, sir. It's gone.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.001
It's being blocked.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.336
Lock the area down.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.338
Call lapd for help.

38:28.340 --> 38:31.408
We just got an agent abducted.

38:49.527 --> 38:51.127
What do you want?

38:51.129 --> 38:52.929
We have some
questions for you.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.998
Hands behind your back.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.401
(zip tie whirrs)

39:07.345 --> 39:09.346
I take it
you didn't like my story.

39:09.348 --> 39:13.016
You could have just written
a letter to the editor.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.685
(grunts)

39:16.620 --> 39:19.622
I want the names
of every single person

39:19.624 --> 39:20.890
Who has a copy
of the information

39:20.892 --> 39:22.125
You gave to faris nadir.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.461
There's too many
to keep straight.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.864
And if you keep making me
feel dizzy...

39:29.133 --> 39:31.468
(grunts)

39:33.371 --> 39:35.105
Before we are done here...

39:36.741 --> 39:38.408
...I promise you,

39:38.410 --> 39:39.976
You will give me every name.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.978
(panting)

39:41.980 --> 39:44.814
People will be looking for me.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.484
And if they can't find me,

39:47.486 --> 39:50.820
Then the evidence goes public
and you can't stop it.

39:51.822 --> 39:54.124
You have no idea
who you've angered.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.329
<i>Prince fayeen is a descendant</i>
<i>of the house of saud,</i>

39:59.331 --> 40:02.999
<i>The family anointed by allah</i>
<i>himself to be the guardians</i>

40:03.001 --> 40:05.668
<i>Of mecca.</i>

40:05.670 --> 40:07.337
<i>By attacking the prince,</i>

40:07.339 --> 40:09.005
You have attacked allah himself.

40:11.008 --> 40:14.077
<i>And his wrath is merciless.</i>

40:14.079 --> 40:16.846
Are you going somewhere
with this sermon?

40:16.848 --> 40:18.948
You will cooperate.

40:20.184 --> 40:21.584
<i>You will see.</i>

40:21.586 --> 40:23.119
Will I?

40:23.121 --> 40:25.588
There are worse things
than physical pain.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.526
<i>Worse than death even.</i>

40:34.198 --> 40:36.199
(grunts)

40:36.201 --> 40:38.868
All these years, you thought
you could hide behind a mask.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.870
You thought
you were protecting yourself,

40:40.872 --> 40:42.539
Covering your tracks.

40:42.541 --> 40:46.709
Invisible
to your enemies.

40:46.711 --> 40:48.378
(doorbell rings)

40:48.380 --> 40:50.313
Nobody
can hide forever.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.218
We know your name,

40:55.220 --> 40:58.388
Special agent martin odum
of the fbi.

40:58.390 --> 41:00.457
Isn't that right?
