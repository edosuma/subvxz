WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.430
This is so cool!

00:03.500 --> 00:05.370
First we get flown to a film festival,

00:05.410 --> 00:06.790
and now they shut down the whole mountain

00:06.790 --> 00:08.300
for celebs and their peeps.

00:08.390 --> 00:09.990
Eeep, I love being a peep!

00:11.000 --> 00:13.950
OK, new rule. No rhymes!

00:15.230 --> 00:17.310
Hey, here comes Ryan Sheckler.

00:17.740 --> 00:18.730
How do you know?

00:18.820 --> 00:21.500
The helmet and googles cannot hide those powdy lips.

00:21.500 --> 00:22.230
Look at him!

00:23.450 --> 00:25.430
Nope, nope, sorry, now that I am with Oliver

00:25.460 --> 00:27.710
my heart only skips for one cutie's lips.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.060
OK, now you've rhymed and made me sick, all at the same time.

00:31.110 --> 00:32.270
Hey, you're just jealous

00:32.270 --> 00:34.390
'cause I got the coolest guy on the mountain!

00:34.580 --> 00:35.940
Hey, ski bunny!

00:36.970 --> 00:40.890
Argh! Argh! Snow... snow in my pants!

00:41.380 --> 00:43.210
Yep. He's a keeper.

00:43.790 --> 00:46.550
Are you OK, my fresh, frozen Ollie-Pop?

00:47.250 --> 00:49.520
I wouldn't say no to a little warm-up hug.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.530
OK, I'm gonna go before I hurl barf cubes!

00:53.790 --> 00:55.510
Hey, Ryan, wait up!

00:55.620 --> 00:56.710
If you like Colorado

00:56.710 --> 00:59.000
you're gonna love Montana!

01:05.600 --> 01:06.810
Broke a nail

01:08.840 --> 01:09.950
...I'm OK!

01:17.000 --> 01:19.680
You get the limo out front.

01:21.190 --> 01:24.550
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

01:24.870 --> 01:28.070
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

01:28.700 --> 01:32.630
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.470
Who would've thought that a girl like me

01:36.700 --> 01:42.150
Would double as a superstar?

01:42.810 --> 01:46.710
You get the best of both worlds.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.730
Chill it out, take it slow,

01:48.880 --> 01:50.540
then you rock out the show.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.590
You get the best of both worlds.

01:54.890 --> 01:57.520
Mix it all together and you know that

01:57.520 --> 02:00.260
It's the best of both worlds.

02:00.900 --> 02:04.600
Hannah Montana  S03E20  I Honestly Love You (No, Not You)

02:04.650 --> 02:07.270
I can't believe after that fall all she broke was her ankle.

02:08.370 --> 02:13.650
That's a sack, yes, eat turf Romo.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.660
I should've just left you at home

02:15.660 --> 02:17.200
with a bowl of kibble and a dish of water.

02:18.220 --> 02:19.470
What did the Doctor say?

02:19.650 --> 02:21.720
He said the surgery went great.

02:21.890 --> 02:24.280
Anesthesia should wear off in a couple of hours.

02:24.340 --> 02:27.200
I mean, this is the longest I can remember her not talking.

02:27.590 --> 02:29.940
It's so nice!

02:31.360 --> 02:33.720
I mean, she looks so peaceful when she's sleeping.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.200
I apologize for my boyfriend, Mr Stewart,

02:36.280 --> 02:37.520
he is a work in progress.

02:37.580 --> 02:38.820
Go L-train go

02:40.000 --> 02:41.820
Yeah, I know what you mean, he's a work in...

02:42.200 --> 02:44.030
no, he's just a piece of work!

02:47.490 --> 02:49.320
Oh no, we can't have this many people in the room,

02:49.350 --> 02:50.260
one at a time please.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.490
Oh, OK, sorry doctor.

02:51.540 --> 02:52.970
Oh, I'm not a doctor, I'm a nurse.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.330
Nurse!

02:54.750 --> 02:56.510
-Something amusing you?  -No, sir.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.810
Ya' darn two

02:58.930 --> 03:01.680
Nursing is a very noble profession for anyone.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.770
I...I...I couldn't agree more.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.780
In fact, I was thinking of pursuing a career in the...

03:07.780 --> 03:09.780
nursial arts.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.780
-Who wants to go the cafeteria?  -I want to, I wanna leave.

03:16.190 --> 03:17.960
Bigger than my garage!

03:17.960 --> 03:18.670
Tell me about it!

03:18.700 --> 03:21.270
And where do you find a size twenty-two nursing shoe?

03:21.300 --> 03:22.240
OK, if you guys don't get out of here,

03:22.440 --> 03:24.320
I think you all know where you're going to find that shoe!

03:26.000 --> 03:27.480
Yeah! Go

03:29.540 --> 03:30.720
Looks like she's doing just fine.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.460
Thank you. And, sorry about my son.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.210
You know, you could've just left him home

03:36.210 --> 03:37.160
with some kibble and water.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.400
Tell me about it.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.810
You listen here baby girl,

03:41.490 --> 03:43.810
this smiling face is gonna be the first thing

03:43.810 --> 03:45.670
you see when you wake up.

03:49.700 --> 03:53.290
Oh man! What I wouldn't give for a cattle prod right now.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.770
Wait a minute, how can I hear if I'm still asleep?

03:57.800 --> 03:59.770
Oh, I saw this in a Kate Hudson movie!

03:59.800 --> 04:01.460
Her doctor said it was totally rare,

04:01.470 --> 04:03.050
but while the anesthesia was wearing off,

04:03.120 --> 04:04.240
she could hear stuff.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.870
And then this happened!

04:07.040 --> 04:10.560
She imagined herself outside of her body! So cool!

04:13.580 --> 04:15.240
And that is so loud!

04:15.550 --> 04:17.510
Yo, daddy, I'm trying to sleep over there.

04:21.800 --> 04:22.810
Wake up!

04:24.870 --> 04:25.640
Dang it!

04:25.680 --> 04:26.190
In the movie,

04:26.190 --> 04:29.320
Kate Hudson gets a marriage proposal from Ashton Kutcher.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.130
And I get a headache from a wheezy hillbilly honker!

04:35.620 --> 04:36.460
Hey dad!

04:38.650 --> 04:39.470
Dad!

04:43.360 --> 04:45.660
Cafeteria's got pie.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.460
Pie? I heard pie!

04:48.130 --> 04:52.030
Hey Jackson, I'm just gonna run down to cafeteria for a bit.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.690
Pie! I mean, bye.

04:58.010 --> 04:59.860
I never thought I would say this, but,

04:59.900 --> 05:00.960
thank you Jackson!

05:01.380 --> 05:04.630
The only thing worse than the sound of dad's snoring is...

05:05.630 --> 05:07.730
Go L-train go

05:08.000 --> 05:10.660
...the sound of you watching football!

05:10.730 --> 05:14.300
Touchdown! Whoa!!!

05:14.610 --> 05:16.480
Could you be any more insensitive?

05:16.570 --> 05:19.060
Yeah, woah!!

05:20.710 --> 05:22.230
Apparently yes.

05:23.110 --> 05:25.240
Stupid commercials.

05:31.860 --> 05:33.630
What is wrong with this remote?

05:34.260 --> 05:36.280
It's in the hands of a bozo!

05:40.140 --> 05:41.340
Hey Jackson,

05:41.690 --> 05:42.590
what happened!

05:42.810 --> 05:44.450
The Titan's just lost a fumble.

05:45.030 --> 05:46.450
I'm talking about Miley!

05:47.430 --> 05:49.280
Ha? How'd that happen?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.340
Bozo!

05:52.410 --> 05:53.480
That's what I said.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.440
Hey, argh, why don't you make yourself useful

05:55.440 --> 05:56.640
and go down to the cafeteria

05:56.700 --> 05:58.930
and throw yourself between your dad and the blueberry pie.

05:59.390 --> 06:02.250
Hey, squirt. That might work on your boyfriend

06:02.270 --> 06:04.720
but not on a high school graduate.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.510
Oh, well, why don't I tell your dad

06:07.520 --> 06:09.320
how a high school graduate turned

06:09.320 --> 06:11.800
his helpless daughter into an accordion.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.940
Fine. But FYI, he doesn't even like blueberries.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.830
He's probably already scarfed down the apple,

06:17.830 --> 06:19.550
pumpkin and banana cream.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.630
Yeah, well he already scarfed down the apple,

06:21.630 --> 06:23.150
pumpkin and banana cream.

06:23.310 --> 06:25.650
Do I know my daddy or what? Yeah!

06:26.120 --> 06:28.950
Great. The last time I got between my dad and his pie,

06:29.000 --> 06:30.270
I almost lost a finger!

06:30.770 --> 06:32.580
sure he apologized afterwards,

06:32.770 --> 06:35.550
but I'll never forgot that crazed look on his face.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.630
My pie! My pie!

06:43.000 --> 06:46.110
Oh, your skin looks so dry!

06:46.140 --> 06:48.190
Nothing a little lotion can't fix.

06:48.430 --> 06:51.230
Finally. Someone to treat me with a little tenderness.

06:51.510 --> 06:52.850
Go ahead, Lilly.

06:52.850 --> 06:55.360
I'll put myself in your loving, capable hands.

06:56.650 --> 07:00.080
Oh, Lilly! You're the best friend a girl could ever have.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.770
In fact, I just wrote a song for you.

07:03.510 --> 07:07.320
Lily is perfect! She's cute and she works it!

07:07.450 --> 07:11.230
She's perfectly perfect and perfectly cute!

07:11.710 --> 07:13.260
Next time you spend the night at my house,

07:13.520 --> 07:15.500
pickle relish is so going in your bra!

07:18.000 --> 07:20.170
Hey, Lilypop. How's she doing?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.920
Oh, she's good. She's still sleeping,

07:22.010 --> 07:23.300
but look what I can make her do.

07:23.750 --> 07:26.590
Oh, Oliver, you're so lucky

07:26.590 --> 07:28.740
to have a girlfriend as cute as Lilly!

07:29.000 --> 07:30.700
Come on Lilly, that's not funny.

07:30.710 --> 07:31.890
Thank you, Oliver.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.500
This is funny!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.120
Pig nose!

07:36.210 --> 07:37.040
You bad boy.

07:37.170 --> 07:39.440
Where's a good snot rocket when I need one?

07:40.000 --> 07:40.640
Argh, you know what,

07:40.640 --> 07:42.540
I think I'm gonna wash this stuff off my hands.

07:42.550 --> 07:43.120
OK.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.170
I'll miss you!

07:44.200 --> 07:45.700
I'll miss you more!

07:45.780 --> 07:48.030
Oh, hey, I've got an idea.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.290
Go with her!

07:51.710 --> 07:53.450
You know, it's really nice to hug

07:53.450 --> 07:55.500
in front of Miley without hearing blah.

07:55.510 --> 07:56.140
Blah!

08:00.120 --> 08:02.290
Alright Oken, I may be out cold

08:02.310 --> 08:05.140
but if you put your fingers anywhere near my nose,

08:05.200 --> 08:06.600
I will wake up just to bite you!

08:07.620 --> 08:10.370
OK. Here we go.

08:12.370 --> 08:13.900
I felt this long enough.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.240
Oh, man! Can't you just wait 'til you get in the hallway?

08:19.320 --> 08:22.240
Whoa. It is harder than I thought.

08:23.230 --> 08:24.720
You're really upset about something.

08:25.890 --> 08:27.280
I don't think I can do this.

08:27.330 --> 08:28.130
Sure you can.

08:28.470 --> 08:30.220
We're buds, you can tell me anything.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.890
Come on, Oliver! I mean, just say it.

08:33.190 --> 08:34.360
Say it!

08:42.010 --> 08:42.890
I love you.

08:42.909 --> 08:45.570
Now you see, that wasn't so...

08:46.590 --> 08:48.320
best friend's boyfriend say what?

08:49.370 --> 08:50.660
I really do.

08:51.010 --> 08:54.280
Nooo! You can't! You're dating Lilly!

08:54.350 --> 08:55.490
It'll break her heart.

08:55.590 --> 08:59.310
Yeah, like I'm ever really gonna have the guts to say that.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.370
Did you miss me!

09:01.420 --> 09:04.960
Argh, you know I did! You're my little Lillypop.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.770
And you're a little lying poop!

09:15.430 --> 09:18.390
Unbelievable, I'm so mad I could spit.

09:18.460 --> 09:21.220
If cracker doesn't give me such bad cotton mouth.

09:22.820 --> 09:24.620
See? Nothing.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.990
Honey, will you stop pacing and put your leg up?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.190
The doctor said you're supposed to keep it elevated.

09:29.270 --> 09:31.200
There, problem solved.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.240
Oh wait, it's not!

09:33.380 --> 09:36.440
How can Oliver say that he loves me when he's dating Lilly?

09:36.790 --> 09:37.960
What can you blame him?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.730
I mean, minus the sass, you are adorable

09:40.820 --> 09:43.080
Oh come on, I am not...

09:43.110 --> 09:44.430
OK, maybe a little.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.460
But, Lilly's my best friend.

09:46.570 --> 09:49.290
Now wait a second here, you weren't even awake yet..

09:49.580 --> 09:51.290
Maybe you dreamed of this whole thing.

09:51.330 --> 09:52.910
Oh, so now I'm not adorable?

09:53.010 --> 09:55.210
Fine, but I'm still sassing.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.040
And I do not think I was asleep when you were

09:57.040 --> 09:59.200
over there snoring like a grizzly with a head cold.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.910
Then in the cafeteria cleaning out  pies.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.370
Oh my good, you did hear everything, didn't you?

10:04.750 --> 10:07.850
Hey, this is just like that Kate Hudson movie.

10:08.380 --> 10:09.520
Thank you.

10:11.790 --> 10:12.850
What's so funny?

10:12.870 --> 10:16.430
It's just in the movie, she got... Ashton Kutcher and

10:17.000 --> 10:18.960
You got... Oliver.

10:19.050 --> 10:21.630
Ha you're right, that is funny.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.390
Oopsies.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.430
I don't wanna be in a duel.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.210
Why do you have to do anything?

10:29.930 --> 10:32.420
Because, I can't let Lilly date Oliver

10:32.420 --> 10:33.460
knowing he's in love with me.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.310
This stinks.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.810
You know back when I was a boy...

10:38.820 --> 10:40.650
Oh no, haven't I suffered enough..

10:40.710 --> 10:42.680
Now hold on baby doll, this one's got a point.

10:43.340 --> 10:48.310
When I was 16 years old, I was crazy about Gabriella Gaffe.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.930
Woo she was all that something

10:51.780 --> 10:53.760
Until I met Heather Whip

10:54.040 --> 10:56.860
Oh man, she was something...

10:56.870 --> 10:59.300
Alright, get the point was to completely creep me out,

10:59.300 --> 11:00.640
mission accomplished!

11:01.680 --> 11:04.000
Oh honey what I am saying is that you know

11:04.010 --> 11:07.230
One time Oliver thought he loved Lilly now he don't

11:07.270 --> 11:09.960
And who knows, she might change her mind too.

11:10.350 --> 11:12.340
By the middle of next week she might be all

11:12.340 --> 11:15.130
googoo over Hottie Lomatie with the swimmer's body.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.770
What? Like I can't hear you in there flapping

11:18.770 --> 11:20.570
your jaws on the phone all night long?

11:22.020 --> 11:25.120
You're right, I gotta wait,

11:25.120 --> 11:27.050
till Lilly moves on to someone else.

11:27.090 --> 11:28.450
I don't have to tell her anything.

11:28.710 --> 11:29.800
That's all you can do.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.970
But wait, what about what about Oliver being in love with me?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.420
I still have to deal with that, don't I?

11:33.470 --> 11:35.760
Oh he might change his mind on that by next week.

11:35.770 --> 11:38.740
Oh great, so now my adorable has an expiration date?

11:39.250 --> 11:41.600
Why did I have to open that door?

11:44.480 --> 11:47.040
Hey Miley, picked up your favorite ice cream

11:47.060 --> 11:48.600
'Cause I figured it might make you feel better

11:48.600 --> 11:49.710
while you're shut in the house all day

11:49.790 --> 11:51.390
Although I don't know how you can eat double double

11:51.390 --> 11:53.500
white chocolate chip I mean it's so rich but

11:53.550 --> 11:55.500
as long as you like it, I mean, that's all it matters.

11:55.940 --> 11:56.900
There you go

11:57.770 --> 12:00.280
Oh great, my favorite.

12:00.340 --> 12:03.330
Soggy cardboard and... Lilly hair

12:04.690 --> 12:06.670
What did you do? Stick your head in there?

12:07.070 --> 12:10.150
I'm sorry, it's just that... I'm totally nervous

12:10.160 --> 12:11.900
I'm getting together with Oliver tonight.

12:11.990 --> 12:13.970
And there's something I need to tell him.

12:14.010 --> 12:14.910
You do?

12:14.930 --> 12:16.910
Yeah, but I don't know what he's gonna do when I say it.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.630
Oh go ahead, so you've moved on

12:19.630 --> 12:21.010
I'm sure Oliver will be fine.

12:21.430 --> 12:23.060
Moved on? Where did you get that?

12:23.540 --> 12:24.980
I'm gonna tell him I love him.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.220
Looks like I can finally spit.

12:36.430 --> 12:37.840
Tell Oliver you love him?

12:38.170 --> 12:39.510
You can't do that!

12:39.810 --> 12:40.750
Why?

12:42.030 --> 12:45.020
Because the girls should never say it first!

12:45.230 --> 12:46.160
It's against the rules!

12:46.170 --> 12:47.650
Can't give a boy that kind of power.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.330
You do that, you'll set back the women's movement 50 years!

12:50.400 --> 12:51.890
And I'm 2 years away from voting.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.310
And you will not take that away from me!

12:54.150 --> 12:55.510
But I do love him.

12:55.610 --> 12:56.830
Yeah, and I love peanut butter.

12:56.990 --> 12:58.430
But you don't see me making a fool of myself

12:58.430 --> 12:59.810
in front of a jar of extra chunky.

13:00.370 --> 13:01.980
Well I don't care

13:02.000 --> 13:03.200
I love him and I'm gonna tell him

13:03.210 --> 13:04.540
What if he doesn't love you back?

13:04.570 --> 13:06.530
What if he's in love with someone else because

13:06.530 --> 13:08.640
they're I don't know... adorable or something.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.970
I am tired, gotta go take a nap, see ya.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.190
You know something I don't?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.410
How would I know anything?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.640
I was in the hospital, out cold!

13:21.820 --> 13:23.570
It's not like I can hear things like that

13:23.570 --> 13:25.930
totally unrealistic Kate Hudson movie.

13:26.700 --> 13:29.410
You know what, I am tired, gotta go to bed, night night.

13:30.490 --> 13:31.910
Miley, I know how he feels.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.490
I can tell by the way he looks at me.

13:33.650 --> 13:35.280
Even when I have a pimple.

13:36.610 --> 13:38.190
I never told you this but...

13:38.260 --> 13:40.080
That's why he calls me Lillypop.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.100
I could've gone my whole life not knowing that.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.030
I'm gonna go get ready.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.190
Oh oh, can I borrow your never-smudge lipstick?

13:48.210 --> 13:49.910
I think it might come in handy, if you know what I mean.

13:50.150 --> 13:53.030
You might wanna borrow my water proof mascara instead.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.710
Right, cause I'll be so happy I'll cry

13:56.920 --> 13:57.860
You're half right.

13:58.900 --> 13:59.590
What do you mean?

14:01.050 --> 14:04.420
Well I can pretty much guarantee crying it's just...

14:04.600 --> 14:06.410
The happy I'm not so sure about.

14:07.840 --> 14:12.190
Lilly, I didn't wanna tell you this before but...

14:12.640 --> 14:14.280
He doesn't love you.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.120
Of course he does

14:16.210 --> 14:17.880
No, he doesn't.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.120
Remember when I was in the hospital and

14:20.240 --> 14:21.980
Everybody thought I couldn't hear?

14:22.330 --> 14:25.340
Well I could and, I heard him say that he

14:26.990 --> 14:28.110
doesn't love you.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.100
He doesn't love me?

14:30.170 --> 14:30.900
Sorry, Lilly.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.920
No, Miley, you had to be dreaming.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.910
If I was dreaming would I've heard this?

14:35.230 --> 14:38.760
Lily is perfect! She's cute and she works it!

14:39.820 --> 14:42.000
Oh no!

14:42.020 --> 14:44.200
It's okay, go ahead and cry.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.074

14:53.340 --> 14:55.680
Here you go, got you another box.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.880
Here, use this cold pack

15:08.420 --> 15:10.770
OK, no sense in wastin' it.

15:16.000 --> 15:16.810
There.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.420
Gosh Lilly, if I would've known you're gonna cry this much

15:19.420 --> 15:20.500
I would've built a boat.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.450
I'm sorry, I think I'm done.

15:24.610 --> 15:26.380
Good, 'cuz you know what,

15:26.470 --> 15:28.160
Oliver is not worth it.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.860
-Oliver!!  -Oh sweet niblets.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.830
Oh no, poor Lilly.

15:36.090 --> 15:38.310
You told her Oliver was in love with you?

15:39.440 --> 15:40.940
In love with you?!

15:41.150 --> 15:44.080
No, I cleverly avoided that, until now!

15:46.130 --> 15:47.790
Beep!

15:48.940 --> 15:51.750
Ah, I think I'm getting a fax, I'd better go check.

15:52.270 --> 15:53.830
Beep!

15:53.970 --> 15:56.740
Eh, hope I got enough paper in there, see you.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.100
How could you?!

16:01.110 --> 16:04.220
Lilly, I swear I had nothing to do with it!

16:05.110 --> 16:06.370
I'm adorable!

16:06.490 --> 16:08.370
It's a gift and a curse.

16:08.410 --> 16:10.680
And the important thing is: I don't feel the same way.

16:11.040 --> 16:11.750
Really?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.410
Of course not. In fact,

16:14.490 --> 16:16.240
Right now I hate him as much as you do.

16:16.650 --> 16:19.940
That miserable slimy Miley-loving weasel.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.270
Stringing me along, he never even loved me.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.350
Oh I wish I could get him back!

16:24.360 --> 16:25.950
You can, you know what we're gonna do?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.600
We're gonna fix you all up, then take you down to the beach.

16:28.610 --> 16:30.880
And get a picture of you with a cute guy, send it to Oliver.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.890
So he knows that you're over it, and you never even loved him.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.030
But I did!!

16:36.030 --> 16:38.110
Lilly please, if you gonna waste this much water,

16:38.120 --> 16:39.350
Just go cry over my plants.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.180
OK.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.560
Stop crying, you're  gonna ruin your make up.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.750
OK, I'm sorry I'm sorry, I'll stop.

16:53.390 --> 16:54.660
How do I look?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.250
Zip it Jackson, you look great.

17:04.550 --> 17:06.700
Yeah, if you like circus clowns.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.089
No honey, you have inner beauty.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.510
Now let's find you a hunk with a big heart,

17:16.540 --> 17:18.280
and bad eyes ok.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.150
Sit here, let's see what we're working with

17:22.369 --> 17:23.510
Hello.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.170
Goodbye.

17:31.270 --> 17:32.880
Woo, hubba hubba.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.730
Did you find somebody?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.410
Not really your type.

17:39.000 --> 17:39.990
Bingo,

17:40.760 --> 17:42.810
cute but, I can live without him.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.560
Alright now you stay here and try

17:44.600 --> 17:47.850
Try to put some of your inner beauty onto the outside.

17:47.860 --> 17:48.740
-OK?  -OK.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.080
How's this?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.770
I got two words for ya: paper bag.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.780
Yeah, look who's talking.

18:01.090 --> 18:02.710
I remember your last girlfriend,

18:02.760 --> 18:05.610
The date went great until the dog catcher showed up.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.700
Woof!  Woof! Woof! Woof!

18:12.000 --> 18:14.260
Hey, how's it going?

18:14.390 --> 18:16.510
Good, what happened to your leg?

18:16.580 --> 18:18.080
I'm not really in the mood for sweet talk.

18:18.100 --> 18:18.970
You a good kisser?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.450
I guess so.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.390
But shouldn't we get to know each other first?

18:22.400 --> 18:23.270
I'm Gil.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.110
I'm actually talking about my friend over there.

18:27.260 --> 18:28.210
The circus clown?

18:28.320 --> 18:29.800
She is not a...

18:30.530 --> 18:32.730
Yes, a circus clown.

18:33.730 --> 18:34.700
I don't think so.

18:37.000 --> 18:37.990
What's up guys?

18:38.000 --> 18:38.920
I'll give you 20 bucks.

18:39.700 --> 18:40.930
Can I just shake her hands?

18:40.930 --> 18:42.360
-25.  -Deal.

18:42.370 --> 18:45.150
OK, Gil Lil Lil Gil

18:45.190 --> 18:46.240
Let's do this thing.

18:47.270 --> 18:49.340
I don't think I can do it, Miley.

18:49.350 --> 18:51.230
Guy doesn't love you at 2 o'clock.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.380
OK OK.

18:53.810 --> 18:55.040
I can close my eyes, right?

18:55.060 --> 18:55.880
Just do it!

18:59.770 --> 19:00.810
What the?

19:01.250 --> 19:04.140
Yep, that's right! She's kissing someone else.

19:04.190 --> 19:06.490
She has moved on. You cannot hurt her anymore.

19:06.510 --> 19:09.400
Hurt her? Miley what are you talking about? I love her.

19:09.630 --> 19:10.910
-You do?  -You do?

19:11.410 --> 19:13.520
Yeah,  I mean I did until you were inches

19:13.520 --> 19:15.050
away from kissing another guy.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.700
Then why do you say you love me?

19:16.860 --> 19:18.270
I never said that.

19:18.780 --> 19:20.380
I still get paid either way, right?

19:20.510 --> 19:22.580
-You paid him?  -Not important.

19:23.650 --> 19:24.650
What is important,

19:24.650 --> 19:26.660
is that while I was sleeping in the hospital,

19:26.740 --> 19:28.170
You said that you love me!

19:28.240 --> 19:29.270
No, I didn't.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.770
-Yes, you did!  -She heard you!

19:30.800 --> 19:31.730
She heard...

19:32.150 --> 19:36.600
Oh! No, I wasn't saying it to Miley,

19:36.900 --> 19:39.060
I was practicing to say it to you.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.950
-To me?  -To her?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.670
Yeah, it's not easy saying "I love you"

19:43.670 --> 19:45.120
if you've never said it to a girl before.

19:45.780 --> 19:50.310
Oh! I love you too, Olliepop.

19:50.630 --> 19:52.840
This isn't exactly how I wanted to tell you.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.480
This isn't exactly how I wanted to look when you did.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.680
You look beautiful.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.790
I'm not gonna get paid, am I?

20:02.060 --> 20:05.280
Please, everyone knows you can't clean the cash

20:05.290 --> 20:06.900
unless you kiss the clown.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.950
Hey, how about that? Happy ending.

20:12.310 --> 20:14.070
That's what all really matters.

20:14.150 --> 20:16.380
Well I better get going, go get this leg up.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.470
Miley.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.860
You almost broke us up.

20:20.550 --> 20:24.510
True, but see, all because of this

20:24.510 --> 20:26.540
totally innocent misunderstanding.

20:26.710 --> 20:28.830
You guys finally said "I love you" to each other.

20:29.130 --> 20:31.180
So I think the words you're looking for are "Thank you".

20:31.210 --> 20:33.320
To which I reply "You're welcome".

20:33.980 --> 20:38.540
Miley, if we weren't so incredibly happy

20:38.550 --> 20:40.340
You'll be in so much trouble right now.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.570
But you are.

20:41.930 --> 20:44.360
And I'v never been so happy to be wrong.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.800
I can't believe you thought I was in love with you.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.040
I can't believe I thought you were in love with her.

20:52.490 --> 20:54.580
OK guys, it's not that funny I mean,

20:54.620 --> 20:56.130
Look at me, I'm adorable.

20:58.490 --> 21:01.550
It's true, my daddy said so.

21:08.620 --> 21:12.410
This is so cool, it's like that Kate Hudson movie.

21:16.530 --> 21:17.470
My boy.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.700
Oh look at me, I'm Robby Ray Stewart

21:20.710 --> 21:22.790
And I jogged all the way to the mailbox

21:22.800 --> 21:24.500
So now I can have pie.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.380
Dangflabit, Jackon ate my pie.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.290
Dangflabit, Jackon ate my pie.

21:31.310 --> 21:33.850
And it was good.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.850
That tears it, that boy's gonna pay.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.720
Pay? What do you mean pay?

21:39.440 --> 21:42.070
Hey what are you doing with whipped cream? And the jelly

21:42.100 --> 21:43.450
Come on man, I'm sleeping.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.610
Hey buddy, wake up!

21:45.630 --> 21:47.720
Wake up and defend yourself!

21:51.150 --> 21:52.630
I can't watch this.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.140
Oh yeah, very nice.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.310
Yee doggies!

22:01.030 --> 22:04.820
Real mature, so proud to call you my dad!

22:05.720 --> 22:07.470
Wa ha, the master piece.
