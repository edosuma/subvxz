WEBVTT

00:04.054 --> 00:06.743
ER

00:06.744 --> 00:08.353
Previously on ER...

00:08.354 --> 00:11.623
- How does a week in St. Barth sound?
- St. Barth's? In the Caribbean?

00:11.924 --> 00:14.088
I defend you in the civil rights
suit against you.

00:14.089 --> 00:16.684
In exchange, I play doctor for a day.

00:16.885 --> 00:19.862
You know and I know this was not
about your HIV status.

00:19.863 --> 00:21.099
- Do I?
- Anna?

00:21.100 --> 00:22.649
- This is my cousin Chase.
- Hi.

00:22.650 --> 00:25.104
This is Anna Del Amico.
We intern together.

00:25.405 --> 00:27.860
She is a young woman.
She deserves a chance to keep her leg.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.269
Got a hot one, Lizzie?

00:29.270 --> 00:31.774
Couldn't ask for a better candidate
for a free fib transfer.

00:31.775 --> 00:32.775
She's crumping!

00:32.776 --> 00:35.666
- Get on it, Corday!
- Sternal saw! Sternal saw!

00:38.158 --> 00:40.882
"Do You See What I See?"

00:40.817 --> 00:43.296
Doug.

00:43.736 --> 00:45.481
It's time to get up.

00:48.203 --> 00:49.829
A few more minutes.

00:51.627 --> 00:53.289
You have to get up now.

00:53.506 --> 00:56.925
Your shift's over. You got all day.

00:57.389 --> 01:00.476
- What time is it?
- It's 6: 10.

01:00.770 --> 01:03.525
- How was your night?
- I hate night shifts.

01:03.735 --> 01:05.729
- Did you get tomorrow off?
- Not yet.

01:05.906 --> 01:08.613
- Did you get tonight off?
- No, I owe too many shifts.

01:08.828 --> 01:12.082
- Christmas Eve will cost me double.
- This is so unfair.

01:12.711 --> 01:16.250
Well, flex your muscle.
You make the nursing schedule.

01:16.469 --> 01:18.428
Yeah, which is why I get stuck with it.

01:18.598 --> 01:22.303
"Carol can work Christmas, she has no
life. " They don't even feel guilty.

01:22.523 --> 01:24.732
Make them feel guilty about it.

01:24.945 --> 01:26.939
Now, that's the Christmas spirit.

01:27.157 --> 01:28.357
Tell them about us.

01:28.577 --> 01:32.163
This is stupid.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:32.376 --> 01:33.956
You know that.

01:34.965 --> 01:36.342
I know.

01:37.595 --> 01:38.925
I know.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.777
Two hundred! Clear!

01:45.987 --> 01:48.196
One more. Clear!

01:48.367 --> 01:51.039
- Herb, you finished?
- Yeah, I'm done. Finito.

01:51.248 --> 01:53.492
Break it down. That's a wrap.
Very good.

01:53.711 --> 01:56.751
George, you're very good.
Very believable.

01:56.968 --> 01:58.713
Any papers I need to sign?

01:58.888 --> 02:01.561
Some formalities.
I'll send them over. You're done.

02:01.769 --> 02:04.643
- That's it?
- The Law family wanted an apology.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.438
An apology? From me?

02:06.654 --> 02:10.193
"No possibility," I said.
You're all done. You're clear.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.243
I want a picture with you.

02:12.416 --> 02:14.327
- Chris, one more.
- That's okay.

02:14.545 --> 02:17.003
I made the lawsuit disappear. Smile.

02:17.217 --> 02:18.927
This is going up on my wall.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074

02:46.109 --> 02:48.354
Good morning.

02:49.199 --> 02:50.315
Good morning.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.201
- Need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

02:55.420 --> 02:57.498
Damn it! On second thought, yeah.

02:57.675 --> 03:00.085
- Waited till the last minute, huh?
- Yeah.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.421
You clean them out?

03:01.641 --> 03:04.847
I'm bringing the baby to my sister's.
I can't be outdone.

03:05.023 --> 03:08.146
Don't get discouraged if he ends up
playing with all the boxes.

03:08.363 --> 03:10.358
Are those for the Christmas party?

03:10.576 --> 03:14.447
They're pizzelles. Italian Christmas
cookies. My mom bakes them.

03:14.667 --> 03:17.208
I thought I'd give it
a try since I won't get home.

03:17.423 --> 03:20.047
- It's not quite the same, you know?
- Yeah.

03:20.638 --> 03:21.968
Can you give us a hand?

03:22.183 --> 03:24.261
- What's with the dog?
- Put this inside.

03:24.479 --> 03:28.647
Blind pedestrian versus auto.
Hit-and-run. Head trauma. Brief LOC.

03:28.863 --> 03:32.995
GCS 15, loose extremities times four.
Name's Bart. Lives under the bridge.

03:33.205 --> 03:36.744
- Homeless with a guide dog?
- It's not his fault. I made him go.

03:36.921 --> 03:38.880
Okay, hold up. Hold up.

03:39.092 --> 03:40.504
How's your neck? Any pain?

03:41.347 --> 03:43.222
- What's going on?
- Can you feel this?

03:43.434 --> 03:45.928
- It's snowing.
- Let's get him inside.

03:46.106 --> 03:48.647
No, you don't understand.
My eyes. I can see!

03:48.862 --> 03:50.358
Sir, try not to move.

03:50.574 --> 03:52.865
You're a black man in a brown coat!

03:53.079 --> 03:55.786
She's blond in a red jacket!
I can see! I can see!

03:56.419 --> 03:58.794
Santos! Santos, is that you?

04:49.363 --> 04:51.857
It's a miracle.
You're a miracle worker, doc.

04:52.036 --> 04:53.151
That's what we all say.

04:53.372 --> 04:56.330
The room is green.
There is a big light above me.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.122
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.

04:59.343 --> 05:02.052
Your shirt's brown
under a yellow apron thing.

05:02.267 --> 05:03.762
- How many fingers?
- Three.

05:03.979 --> 05:05.392
- He can see.
- I told you.

05:05.608 --> 05:07.270
You have the magic touch.

05:07.487 --> 05:10.575
If x-rays are normal,
send for a non-contrast CT.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.988
Wait! What's your name?

05:13.208 --> 05:15.037
- What's his scam?
- I don't know.

05:15.254 --> 05:17.130
But that guy was never blind.

05:19.097 --> 05:20.890
- What's his name?
- Dr. Benton.

05:22.605 --> 05:25.015
Lydia, can you cover for me
tomorrow night?

05:25.235 --> 05:28.406
I'm cooking Christmas dinner
for Al's family, all 25.

05:28.618 --> 05:30.162
You're lucky you're working.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.959
You gotta plug in a string,
then separate it one at a time.

05:34.130 --> 05:36.625
Oh, really?
Then why don't you show me.

05:36.845 --> 05:40.550
Carter, would your grandparents
like any food or anything?

05:40.771 --> 05:41.803
For what?

05:41.981 --> 05:44.273
They're coming to see
the clinic today.

05:44.487 --> 05:47.195
Their annual pilgrimage
to their worthy causes.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.037
- It's that bad?
- No.

05:49.248 --> 05:52.668
But the clinic won't be
the only thing being checked out.

05:54.009 --> 05:56.502
Henry! Something wrong?

05:56.723 --> 05:59.300
No. I feel much better. Why?

05:59.521 --> 06:00.851
You're on time.

06:01.651 --> 06:04.739
I suppose I deserve that.

06:04.950 --> 06:07.242
I still have to pass this clerkship.

06:07.414 --> 06:09.207
No one's pulling for you
more than me.

06:09.376 --> 06:12.547
- A gram of Ancef for our friend in 2?
- Sure thing.

06:12.717 --> 06:15.391
That's good. Because I figure
the only thing...

06:15.558 --> 06:18.681
...that I really haven't done is
a major emergency procedure.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.187
That's a matter of opinion.

06:20.402 --> 06:24.239
So why don't you give me an LP
or an intubation or something...

06:24.453 --> 06:28.372
...and then you can ship me off
with a clear conscience.

06:28.587 --> 06:30.047
I brought my own gloves.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.133
Look, please. I-

06:35.059 --> 06:37.102
Merry Christmas to you too!

06:37.273 --> 06:38.603
Who was that?

06:39.820 --> 06:42.861
I hit my limit on my credit...

06:43.245 --> 06:44.741
...so they froze my card.

06:44.957 --> 06:48.911
Can you believe it? Christmas Eve
and I had your present picked out!

06:50.637 --> 06:53.177
- How much do you owe?
- $600.

06:53.392 --> 06:57.395
And I was making a dent in it,
but with the holidays and everything-

06:58.864 --> 07:02.700
Listen, I haven't gotten
your present yet either.

07:02.915 --> 07:06.703
So why don't I pay your balance
as a Christmas present?

07:07.173 --> 07:09.668
- No, I can't let you do that.
- Sure, you can.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.805
But you have to promise
not to go and spend it on me.

07:14.607 --> 07:15.687
Really?

07:15.901 --> 07:18.740
- Anybody home?
- Carol!

07:18.909 --> 07:21.154
- What happened?
- I went chimney sweeping...

07:21.373 --> 07:23.913
...for Jonathan, 7.
His brother found him stuck.

07:24.128 --> 07:26.421
- Playing Santa?
- Proving Santa could make it.

07:26.635 --> 07:30.174
Complains of shortness of breath
and right shoulder pain.

07:30.393 --> 07:32.269
Still having difficulty breathing.

07:32.439 --> 07:35.777
BP 140/92. Resps at 32, tachy at 150.

07:35.947 --> 07:38.109
- On O-2, 10 liters.
- What is this?

07:38.286 --> 07:41.076
Respiratory distress.
On my count. One, two, three.

07:41.585 --> 07:45.254
- Is there someplace I can clean up?
- A shower is down the hall.

07:45.510 --> 07:49.299
- Pulse ox is 88.
- Stridors breathing and hypoxia.

07:49.478 --> 07:53.979
Two of Versed followed by 50 of sux
and five of Pavulon IV.

07:54.155 --> 07:56.732
- What do we do, Henry?
- Increase the O-2.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.241
No.

07:58.414 --> 08:00.494
Six ET tube.

08:01.171 --> 08:03.795
The soot he inhaled
can cause tracheal edema.

08:04.010 --> 08:05.840
Swelling makes it harder
to intubate.

08:06.057 --> 08:07.850
- So we intubate now?
- Right.

08:08.019 --> 08:10.596
Jonathan, we're gonna put you
to sleep.

08:10.818 --> 08:14.322
Then we're gonna put a tube in
your windpipe to help you breathe.

08:14.534 --> 08:15.698
Can I try it?

08:15.871 --> 08:18.544
Kids are tough.
This isn't really a teaching case.

08:18.752 --> 08:20.213
Next time, Henry.

08:24.766 --> 08:27.343
- Jeanie, you're working today.
- Yeah.

08:27.564 --> 08:30.688
- I didn't see you scheduled.
- I'm volunteering at the clinic.

08:30.863 --> 08:32.193
What are the needles for?

08:32.408 --> 08:34.985
A man with hepatitis B
is sharing with friends.

08:35.206 --> 08:37.746
- You're giving them to him?
- I'll replace them.

08:38.630 --> 08:41.339
That's not my concern.
It's against the law.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.475
Do you want him to pass it on
or get something worse?

08:44.686 --> 08:47.394
Just be careful.
Know who you're dealing with.

08:47.609 --> 08:50.282
The patient won't report me, Kerry.
Will you?

08:53.038 --> 08:56.126
Hey, Saint Peter.
I heard about your miracle.

08:56.295 --> 08:57.840
Some of us have the touch.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.460
- Where's the blind guy?
- He's not blind.

09:00.680 --> 09:04.267
- He's not here either.
- He and his dog left 10 minutes ago.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.936
Said he won't hang around a hospital
when there's a whole world to see.

09:08.155 --> 09:09.866
He just wanted some attention.

09:10.077 --> 09:12.238
Don't sell yourself short.

09:13.167 --> 09:16.706
- You're gonna work a shift?
- I've practiced medicine on occasion.

09:16.925 --> 09:19.681
I thought you had
a backup cover scheduled.

09:19.849 --> 09:23.222
I gave him the day off.
Figured I should keep an eye on you.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.851
Make sure
you made that plane tonight.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.783
Could we get a taxi voucher for Pablo?
He doesn't have shoes.

09:29.996 --> 09:33.037
- Where are your shoes?
- They're gone. I have no shoes.

09:33.254 --> 09:36.924
We've been over this. I'll try
to get you something to wear home.

09:37.138 --> 09:38.254
All right.

09:38.432 --> 09:40.891
- I'll call you a cab?
- I'll wait outside.

09:41.105 --> 09:43.681
No, wait in Chairs.
It's cold outside.

09:44.237 --> 09:46.398
Okay, I'll wait in Chairs.

09:46.617 --> 09:48.992
- Feliz Navidad.
- Feliz Navidad, Pablo.

09:49.164 --> 09:50.329
Thank you, Kerry.

09:50.543 --> 09:52.419
I'm curious. Who pays for those?

09:52.631 --> 09:54.591
The vouchers? Us. Why?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.255
- Get a cab company to comp them.
- How?

09:57.433 --> 09:59.762
Good PR, promise to call
for paying customers.

09:59.981 --> 10:02.606
- No one thought of that before?
- We do it at other ERs.

10:02.779 --> 10:03.812
We'll try it.

10:04.032 --> 10:07.405
Excuse me. Do you have a scrub top
I could borrow?

10:07.790 --> 10:10.878
Greg Powell. Paramedic who
brought the boy in the chimney.

10:11.089 --> 10:13.464
I didn't recognize you.
You clean up well.

10:13.678 --> 10:16.090
- Thank you.
- A scrub top won't keep you warm.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.388
- I'll get a coat from Goodwill.
- It's clean?

10:18.606 --> 10:21.017
And very fashionable. Follow me.

10:21.237 --> 10:23.992
Careful. Watch your step. It's icy.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.286
Vinnie Caviazelli, 48-year-old man.

10:26.499 --> 10:29.837
Experienced acute onset
of crushing substernal chest pain.

10:30.007 --> 10:32.928
Shortness of breath, BP's 50 palp,
resps 28.

10:33.140 --> 10:35.514
O-2 is at 10 liters.
Saline's wide open.

10:35.728 --> 10:37.522
- He's sweating.
- Diaphoretic.

10:37.733 --> 10:39.858
You feeling any pain now,
Mr. Caviazelli?

10:41.199 --> 10:43.075
- How bad?
- He's in cardiogenic shock.

10:43.287 --> 10:46.209
- Trauma 2. I'll be right in.
- I'll get it.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.089
Sure. Great.

10:48.298 --> 10:50.793
Ellis West, visiting Attending.
Carter, is it?

10:51.013 --> 10:53.934
- What do we have?
- Ml. Hypotensive and cyanotic.

10:54.145 --> 10:57.399
Start a dopamine drip,
titrate to a systolic of 100.

10:57.611 --> 10:59.773
Give him aspirin,
5000 units of heparin.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.746
- He's bradying down.
-0.5 of atropine.

11:02.914 --> 11:04.791
Pansystolic murmur.
Hold the heparin.

11:05.003 --> 11:06.083
Is that bad?

11:06.256 --> 11:09.795
Maybe a rupture of the left papillary
muscle or interventricular septum.

11:10.014 --> 11:12.473
- Will we need to intubate him?
- Maybe.

11:12.687 --> 11:14.064
Can I try it?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.936
- Med student?
- Yes. George Henry.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.445
- I can't get a pressure.
- He's crashing!

11:18.617 --> 11:21.492
- Need a hand?
- That's all right, Kerry. Thanks.

11:21.708 --> 11:24.546
Amp of epi and a mg of atropine.
You, bag him.

11:24.755 --> 11:26.882
- Heparin?
- I held it because of a murmur.

11:27.095 --> 11:30.883
Maria. I love you, Maria.

11:32.356 --> 11:34.648
- What?
- I love you, Maria.

11:34.821 --> 11:35.984
Henry, bag him now!

11:36.157 --> 11:37.818
- Let's intubate.
- I got it. Out of the way.

11:37.994 --> 11:39.906
-8.0 please.
- I was gonna do this.

11:40.124 --> 11:41.323
Not now, Henry.

11:42.587 --> 11:44.132
What's in here? Bricks?

11:44.342 --> 11:47.262
Gifts mostly.
No time to ship them all.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.469
- When is your flight?
- Half past 4.

11:49.687 --> 11:52.609
I need to catch up on some
post-op notes before I go.

11:52.819 --> 11:57.534
They'll wait. You can assist me with
the fibular transfer on the Beaumont girl.

11:57.747 --> 11:58.827
- Today?
- Yep.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.829
I'm gonna be out of town next week.

12:01.046 --> 12:02.376
What's her neuro status?

12:02.925 --> 12:06.548
Anesthesiologist signed off. She's
stable for the next phase of surgery.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.397
The first phase put her in a coma.

12:09.566 --> 12:12.190
We started this reconstruction.
Let's finish it.

12:12.405 --> 12:14.484
If she comes out, she'll have her leg.

12:16.915 --> 12:18.827
That's 45 minutes. I'm calling it.

12:19.045 --> 12:21.455
Time of death: 1338.

12:23.890 --> 12:24.970
You can stop now.

12:25.184 --> 12:26.644
Good effort, gentlemen.

12:26.854 --> 12:29.265
Part of the job.
Sometimes you lose them.

12:29.861 --> 12:31.358
I didn't get to intubate.

12:31.574 --> 12:34.447
Sorry. It had to be done fast.
He was coding.

12:35.498 --> 12:37.079
Do you...

12:38.297 --> 12:39.757
...want to try it now?

12:41.053 --> 12:43.095
He's dead.

12:43.851 --> 12:44.968
So?

12:45.397 --> 12:47.142
You're not gonna hurt him, right?

12:47.651 --> 12:49.314
I'll get a death kit.

12:50.282 --> 12:53.822
- Are you sure we can do this?
- You want to pass, don't you?

12:54.041 --> 12:55.834
Try a 7.5.

12:56.337 --> 12:57.538
Okay.

12:59.929 --> 13:01.758
Insert it laterally...

13:04.189 --> 13:06.648
...sweeping the tongue
out of the way...

13:06.862 --> 13:10.365
...and placing the tip of the blade
on the vallecula.

13:10.913 --> 13:13.121
- You see it?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:13.334 --> 13:17.207
Gently, man! Come on. Easy.
You don't want to break his teeth.

13:18.095 --> 13:20.340
Advance until you see the cords.

13:20.559 --> 13:23.135
Then lift the scope 45 degrees.

13:23.607 --> 13:25.437
- Oh, my God! Vinnie!
- Who are you?

13:25.654 --> 13:27.779
Joey, his brother. What happened?

13:27.992 --> 13:29.405
He had a heart attack.

13:29.580 --> 13:32.834
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:33.004 --> 13:34.120
Keep going.

13:34.340 --> 13:36.299
- Wait outside.
- I want to be with him.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.887
I really think it's better
to wait outside.

13:39.101 --> 13:41.726
Come on. Push the epi!
Another round of atropine!

13:42.901 --> 13:44.943
- Sexual assault victim?
- Trauma 1.

13:45.114 --> 13:46.741
- How bad?
- Bad.

13:46.952 --> 13:50.160
67-year-old woman found bound,
gagged and unconscious.

13:50.377 --> 13:53.167
GCS 15, multiple lacs,
contusions and abrasions.

13:53.383 --> 13:55.213
Possible nasal fracture.

13:55.430 --> 13:59.183
Let's get a cross-table C-spine,
cath her and dip the urine for blood.

13:59.397 --> 14:02.271
Nasal fracture. Are these burns
on her mouth and eyes?

14:02.487 --> 14:04.482
No, we had to pull off the duct tape.

14:04.659 --> 14:07.366
BP 135/70. Pulse 120.

14:07.582 --> 14:09.244
Possible ankle fracture here.

14:09.712 --> 14:12.919
You'll be all right, ma'am.
We'll take care of you.

14:13.136 --> 14:14.930
- Where are the cops?
- On their way.

14:15.140 --> 14:16.602
- Oh, God!
- What?

14:26.750 --> 14:30.254
Hey, Jeanie, I have a follow-up otitis.
Could you see him in the clinic?

14:30.425 --> 14:34.262
- Sure. Send him in. I'll be right there.
- Great. Thanks.

14:59.616 --> 15:00.899
10.0 Prolene.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.031
Avoid any axial twisting.

15:03.333 --> 15:06.920
This lumen is quite narrow.

15:07.091 --> 15:08.921
Bovie that bleeder.

15:09.556 --> 15:11.930
- Got it.
- Retract distally.

15:12.102 --> 15:15.939
It's nice to take care of unfinished
business before the holidays.

15:17.114 --> 15:20.285
- Pardon?
- To have a vacation with no worries.

15:21.373 --> 15:23.665
Allison has a few left, I'd say.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.958
You know, worries.

15:27.972 --> 15:30.216
- Kerry, can we talk privately?
- Not now.

15:30.435 --> 15:31.766
- It's important.
- It'll wait.

15:31.981 --> 15:33.477
It can't wait.

15:34.319 --> 15:35.946
I'll be right back.

15:39.832 --> 15:43.620
I left my meds at home,
and I'm on a strict regimen.

15:43.841 --> 15:46.514
- What do you need?
- You handle the ER needle sticks.

15:46.722 --> 15:49.727
I thought you could dispense a dose
of my triple cocktail.

15:49.938 --> 15:51.019
Of course.

15:51.191 --> 15:55.028
- I meant, what's your Crixivan dose?
- Eight hundred milligrams.

15:56.327 --> 16:00.829
- That's 150 of 3TC, 200 AZT?
- That's right.

16:04.053 --> 16:06.132
Thank you.

16:09.064 --> 16:10.347
What do we tell them?

16:10.569 --> 16:12.647
What we would've had to
tell them anyway.

16:12.865 --> 16:14.528
Just follow my lead.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.669
Well, how is he?

16:22.678 --> 16:25.090
Your brother had a massive
heart attack...

16:26.437 --> 16:30.487
...that produced a rhythm
that was incompatible with life.

16:30.697 --> 16:33.655
We applied every lifesaving measure
at our disposal...

16:33.871 --> 16:35.283
...but were unsuccessful.

16:35.457 --> 16:36.954
No.

16:37.128 --> 16:38.672
I'm afraid he didn't make it.

16:38.882 --> 16:40.378
No!

16:44.686 --> 16:45.803
I'm sorry.

16:46.316 --> 16:50.021
You should know that his last thoughts
were of you.

16:50.241 --> 16:52.070
What did he say?

16:52.287 --> 16:54.247
"I love you, Maria. "

16:55.127 --> 16:59.676
Maria? I'm Angela.
Maria is Joey's wife.

17:00.765 --> 17:04.518
- Maria?
- That bastard!

17:07.028 --> 17:10.983
Mrs. Larkin, I'm gonna use a solvent
to get the rest of the tape off.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.832
It may sting a little.

17:13.042 --> 17:15.618
Nurse Hathaway's gonna ask
some questions.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.549
They may be difficult to answer,
but they're important...

17:18.763 --> 17:21.223
...in catching and prosecuting
whoever did this.

17:21.395 --> 17:24.603
And in helping us treat you medically,
Mrs. Larkin.

17:24.903 --> 17:25.983
Okay?

17:26.531 --> 17:28.241
My name's Carol.

17:29.079 --> 17:33.628
To your knowledge, did penetration
occur vaginally?

17:34.383 --> 17:35.712
Yes.

17:36.095 --> 17:37.674
By a penis?

17:38.475 --> 17:39.757
Yes.

17:40.271 --> 17:42.100
By anything else?

17:42.986 --> 17:45.824
Any foreign object, Mrs. Larkin?

17:46.786 --> 17:49.624
I don't know. Maybe.

17:50.627 --> 17:52.789
Did ejaculation occur?

17:53.968 --> 17:55.595
I don't think so.

17:56.391 --> 17:59.015
It happened so fast.

17:59.690 --> 18:02.314
He grabbed me from behind...

18:03.197 --> 18:05.323
...and threw me on the floor.

18:05.536 --> 18:07.032
Then he hit me.

18:08.376 --> 18:12.295
He hit me and kicked me
again and again.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.182
He broke my glasses.

18:18.065 --> 18:21.188
- Did you see his face?
- I don't remember it.

18:22.617 --> 18:25.157
Just the tape. And the...

18:29.757 --> 18:31.753
Can you finish this, Carol?

18:32.556 --> 18:35.893
Nurse Hathaway's going to collect
some samples.

18:37.358 --> 18:41.610
If she needs a sedative,
Valium, five milligrams, PO.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.331
Hey, Peter?

18:46.545 --> 18:50.251
Guess what? I was curious about
your miracle, so I looked him up.

18:50.429 --> 18:54.598
Bart Pariotte. He was in last year.
The chart says he's blind.

18:54.981 --> 18:57.440
- Are you sure?
- Take a look for yourself.

18:57.654 --> 18:59.447
Nothing indicates he was faking it?

18:59.658 --> 19:03.613
No. He came in with a minor leg lac
that he got falling out of a dumpster.

19:03.834 --> 19:06.543
Doesn't look like they did
a visual acuity test.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.297
I wonder what's his angle.

19:09.514 --> 19:13.018
Who knows? The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

19:13.815 --> 19:16.440
- Are you Dr. Benton?
- Yeah.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.859
Tommy Gruger.
I'm a friend of Bart's.

19:19.078 --> 19:21.405
I saw him playing with his dog.

19:21.624 --> 19:23.585
He can see. He says you did it.

19:24.381 --> 19:25.877
I'm sorry. He's mistaken.

19:26.093 --> 19:28.766
Please, help me.
I want to walk again.

19:31.857 --> 19:34.611
Why won't you cure me?
I'll believe whatever you say.

19:34.821 --> 19:36.983
I'm sorry.
There's nothing to believe.

19:37.327 --> 19:39.571
I'm gonna take your picture now, okay?

19:39.790 --> 19:43.745
Broken nose, fractured ankle,
multiple lacerations and contusions.

19:43.967 --> 19:46.009
Duct tape used on her mouth.

19:46.222 --> 19:49.393
Vaginal penetration,
possible foreign object.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.021
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.447
Yeah, they wrote on her.

19:54.658 --> 19:57.697
The word "whore"
in black Magic Marker.

19:59.544 --> 20:01.752
- Does that suggest something?
- Maybe.

20:02.217 --> 20:05.470
Do the injuries seem consistent
with her story?

20:05.682 --> 20:07.808
You think she might have made this up?

20:08.021 --> 20:09.731
A victim isn't always accurate.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.733
It's hard to take notes
while being bludgeoned.

20:13.450 --> 20:15.446
Give her a break.
She's been through a lot.

20:15.789 --> 20:17.748
Okay. We'll take care if it. Thanks.

20:18.252 --> 20:19.629
No problem.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.343
- Your taxi's waiting.
- Great.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.514
Was Allison Beaumont moved
from Recovery?

20:24.726 --> 20:29.061
- She's just coming out of anesthesia.
- No, not this one. She's in a coma.

20:29.278 --> 20:30.738
I don't think so.

20:31.282 --> 20:32.481
Tell the cab to wait.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.461
Allison, can you hear me?

20:38.674 --> 20:42.130
Don't try to speak. Just squeeze
my hand if you hear me.

20:43.017 --> 20:46.605
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Corday.
Do you know where you are?

20:46.859 --> 20:47.940
You're in hospital.

20:48.154 --> 20:52.453
You were involved in a very serious
automobile accident 10 days ago.

20:52.705 --> 20:53.987
Do you understand?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.165
Are you in any pain?

20:59.080 --> 21:00.457
What is it?

21:07.733 --> 21:09.266
MOM?

21:10.913 --> 21:13.075
I'm afraid she didn't survive.

21:14.296 --> 21:16.172
Your mom died.

21:20.685 --> 21:22.182
I'm sorry.

21:22.899 --> 21:23.931
Hey, what's that?

21:24.151 --> 21:26.028
Hey. Oh, nothing.

21:26.240 --> 21:30.492
This guy dropped this off for you.
I think it's more lawyer stuff.

21:30.708 --> 21:32.453
Don't worry. It's good news.

21:32.629 --> 21:34.708
What is it? Is that for me?

21:34.926 --> 21:35.958
No. Mark, don't.

21:36.137 --> 21:37.217
- No.
- Come on.

21:37.431 --> 21:39.308
What'd you get-?

21:40.898 --> 21:44.188
- Who's the heavy artillery for?
- A friend of mine. Her son.

21:44.406 --> 21:46.614
I wish they had this stuff
when I was a kid.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.989
Mark, I finished
Mrs. Larkin's rape form.

21:49.166 --> 21:52.124
Did you want to review it
before I gave it to the cops?

21:52.341 --> 21:54.834
- I'll give her a minute, then see her.
- All right.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.973
That was a lie. This is for my son.

21:59.022 --> 22:01.101
He's 5.

22:01.444 --> 22:02.525
You have a son?

22:03.824 --> 22:06.948
Yeah. I haven't seen him
since he was 2.

22:07.165 --> 22:09.541
But I talked to him on the phone
a few times.

22:10.047 --> 22:14.430
- You've never said anything.
- I know. I'm sorry.

22:14.641 --> 22:16.386
It's really complicated.

22:16.561 --> 22:19.021
His father and I broke up
when he was born.

22:20.571 --> 22:22.566
I wasn't really together back then.

22:22.743 --> 22:25.450
So I decided to let Joe's parents
take care of him.

22:25.665 --> 22:29.882
He lives in a trailer park
right outside Kankakee.

22:30.092 --> 22:32.004
I'll seal the rape kit now.
All right?

22:32.222 --> 22:34.015
Yeah, sure.

22:34.435 --> 22:37.226
I know that this is the best thing
for Jason.

22:37.442 --> 22:40.198
Although I miss him, you know?

22:40.449 --> 22:42.408
Sure. I can only imagine.

22:43.622 --> 22:47.495
But at least this year for Christmas
I can send him some nice things.

22:47.715 --> 22:49.627
- Sure.
- Yeah.

22:52.142 --> 22:54.434
What kind of sicko
would rape an old lady?

22:54.648 --> 22:58.152
I can't count the times I've
done this. It never gets any easier.

22:58.323 --> 22:59.653
I'd worry if it did.

22:59.826 --> 23:02.914
Would you work for me tomorrow?
You'd get time and a half.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.870
Sorry, I'm going skiing with Alex.

23:05.088 --> 23:07.333
Just the slopes, snow
and a hot tub for two.

23:07.510 --> 23:08.709
Sounds great.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.012
Carol, some old lady
with Santa Claus is looking for you.

23:12.229 --> 23:13.428
She's early.

23:13.649 --> 23:16.607
I'm sorry. As policy,
I don't give to panhandlers.

23:16.823 --> 23:19.531
I recommend the Lakeshore Shelter
at 1 Oth and Wacker.

23:19.705 --> 23:20.737
Two bucks.

23:20.957 --> 23:22.833
- Give it a rest.
- Up yours, Santa.

23:23.045 --> 23:25.373
Wait over there.
Someone'll be with you.

23:25.551 --> 23:28.259
I don't want someone.
I want the miracle man.

23:28.474 --> 23:31.348
I'm so sorry about this.
Thank you so much for coming.

23:31.522 --> 23:32.556
My pleasure.

23:32.776 --> 23:36.195
This is another of my grandsons,
Chase, John's cousin.

23:36.408 --> 23:38.035
Hi. Carol Hathaway.

23:38.246 --> 23:39.908
Do you smell smoke?

23:42.088 --> 23:45.128
Oh, my God! Cynthia,
get the fire extinguisher!

23:45.805 --> 23:47.599
- Hey, look out!
- Quick!

23:48.102 --> 23:50.062
- Do you know how to use it?
- Yes.

23:56.078 --> 23:57.277
Nice job!

23:58.751 --> 24:02.290
It's been a little crazy
around here today.

24:04.180 --> 24:05.973
Oh, man!

24:11.625 --> 24:14.083
All the lights need to come down.
They're too old.

24:14.839 --> 24:16.963
Even Rudolph? I just bought him.

24:17.176 --> 24:18.422
Rudolph can stay.

24:18.637 --> 24:20.844
- Carol, we need to talk.
- In a minute.

24:21.015 --> 24:24.849
So this is where the clinic patients
wait before they're seen.

24:25.063 --> 24:27.142
Yeah, I've been here over an hour.

24:27.359 --> 24:32.189
We're still working out a few kinks.
Sharing space with the ER is...

24:32.409 --> 24:33.903
...it's confusing.

24:34.203 --> 24:37.040
- Merry Christmas, Gamma!
- Merry Christmas.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.701
- I was giving her the tour.
- Great. Where's Gramps?

24:39.963 --> 24:44.045
He overdid it playing squash at the
club. Thought it best to stay home.

24:44.261 --> 24:46.385
Bad enough to keep him
out of the Santa suit.

24:46.556 --> 24:48.100
We have an excellent substitute.

24:48.518 --> 24:49.634
- Yes.
- Hi, Scooter.

24:49.853 --> 24:53.604
Very sharp. Is this the new and
improved? Changing of the guard?

24:53.818 --> 24:56.905
- I sure hope not.
- Chase is executive heir apparent.

24:57.115 --> 24:59.358
We can't all be doctors.

25:00.913 --> 25:02.954
Would you like to see an exam room?

25:04.876 --> 25:08.378
- Hey, Nat. How's it going?
- Just fine, Dr. Benton. How are you?

25:08.591 --> 25:10.632
Can't complain.
Having a little trouble?

25:10.845 --> 25:14.513
Yeah. She's 15 years old.
Bound to die on me sometimes.

25:14.685 --> 25:16.014
How's your baby?

25:16.354 --> 25:19.807
Loud. Actually, I'm looking forward
to his first Christmas.

25:20.527 --> 25:23.067
Soon you'll be begging him to
come home.

25:23.282 --> 25:26.699
Enjoy him while he still wants to hang
with his old man.

25:26.870 --> 25:28.864
I'll do that. Merry Christmas, Nat.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.118
Merry Christmas.

25:31.878 --> 25:35.046
Hey, look at that! She's working!

25:41.603 --> 25:43.845
- Hey, Mark.
- Hi.

25:44.733 --> 25:47.853
- You know if we have any decaf?
- Decaf? What's the point?

25:48.070 --> 25:50.445
Carter's grandmother's asking for it.

25:50.659 --> 25:53.365
Listen, did you catch that?
What Cynthia said?

25:53.580 --> 25:55.953
- What?
- She has a kid.

25:56.459 --> 25:58.702
Five-year-old boy. Yeah.

25:58.921 --> 26:01.046
Living with her ex-boyfriend's
parents.

26:01.258 --> 26:04.261
- Is this the first you've heard of it?
- Bad sign?

26:04.471 --> 26:05.587
You're asking me?

26:05.806 --> 26:07.932
Doug warned me not to get involved.

26:08.103 --> 26:12.399
If she's expecting something of you
you're not willing to give...

26:12.610 --> 26:14.769
...you're not helping
by dragging it out.

26:14.946 --> 26:18.234
I'm not dragging anything out.
Cynthia's great.

26:24.087 --> 26:25.795
I thought you were flying home.

26:26.006 --> 26:29.626
I postponed to the red-eye.
Allison Beaumont came out of her coma.

26:29.804 --> 26:31.512
What's the prognosis?

26:31.723 --> 26:33.468
Neurologically she looks good.

26:33.685 --> 26:36.771
We did the fibular transfer
on her leg this morning.

26:36.983 --> 26:38.478
Congratulations. Good work.

26:39.027 --> 26:41.650
Part of me wants to run in there
and confess.

26:41.823 --> 26:44.150
Tell her my enthusiasm
for the procedure...

26:44.327 --> 26:46.535
...put her in a coma in a first place.

26:46.748 --> 26:49.999
Look, you saved her leg.
She's out of danger and better off.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.630
That's it, isn't it?

26:51.839 --> 26:54.414
Purging my guilt will help me
to feel better.

26:54.636 --> 26:56.427
It certainly won't help her.

26:56.638 --> 27:00.686
Bad things happen to people.
But you did your job.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.183
Merry Christmas.

27:04.818 --> 27:06.527
Do you know what happened?

27:06.696 --> 27:09.818
A guy jumped her at her door.
It wasn't a secure building.

27:09.992 --> 27:11.321
You have any leads?

27:11.536 --> 27:13.745
She wasn't much help.
It's still a blur.

27:13.958 --> 27:15.702
Does the writing make it personal?

27:15.876 --> 27:18.204
- Look, Dr...?
- Greene.

27:18.423 --> 27:22.173
We can't discuss an investigation.
But we appreciate your concern.

27:22.387 --> 27:24.714
We'll handle it from here, okay?

27:26.853 --> 27:28.264
Sure, you will.

27:29.858 --> 27:32.231
What, did she liquidate a toy store?

27:32.403 --> 27:35.240
You know Gamma Mill never comes
empty-handed.

27:35.658 --> 27:38.365
- Who are you handing these to?
- Who cares?

27:38.580 --> 27:41.915
- As long as it makes her feel good.
- We could try Pediatrics.

27:42.503 --> 27:47.298
So did Gramps really overdo it or does
he just have an aversion to hospitals?

27:47.511 --> 27:51.760
All men over 70 have an aversion to
hospitals. Don't take it personally.

27:51.934 --> 27:53.050
No, it's a relief.

27:53.269 --> 27:55.728
I don't have to defend
my wasted life in medicine.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.727
Don't think Gamma will report back?

27:57.944 --> 28:00.318
It's a stay of execution, then.

28:00.531 --> 28:03.368
Probably just wants to wait
and get me on his home turf.

28:03.577 --> 28:05.406
He still thinks you're a surgeon.

28:05.623 --> 28:08.959
- Yeah, I'm a coward.
- You're braver than I am.

28:09.129 --> 28:12.629
John, this Mel Sauderback,
headache, fever, malaise.

28:12.842 --> 28:15.133
He needs a spinal tap to
rule out meningitis.

28:15.347 --> 28:16.545
Thought I might do it.

28:17.224 --> 28:19.099
- He has diarrhea?
- Oh, yeah.

28:19.687 --> 28:21.810
It's the stomach flu, Henry.

28:24.111 --> 28:27.564
Honestly, continuity of care
is hard to measure.

28:27.783 --> 28:30.988
Sometimes you're part caregiver,
part social worker...

28:31.164 --> 28:33.834
...even part parent sometimes.
Jeanie?

28:34.001 --> 28:36.245
I'd like you to meet Millicent Carter.

28:36.463 --> 28:37.839
I'm Jeanie Boulet.

28:38.007 --> 28:41.176
Jeanie's a physician assistant
helping out in the clinic.

28:41.346 --> 28:43.839
Can we scrub the writing
off Mrs. Larkin?

28:44.059 --> 28:46.682
- I'll be right there.
- Don't let me keep you.

28:46.854 --> 28:50.641
Jeanie, could Mrs. Carter follow you
while you see patients?

28:50.861 --> 28:52.939
- Sure.
- Only if they're comfortable.

28:53.157 --> 28:54.866
- No problem.
- Great. Thank you.

28:55.076 --> 28:59.373
PCO-230, pH 7.4.

29:00.376 --> 29:02.205
All good news.

29:02.589 --> 29:05.626
How would you like to take that tube
out of your throat?

29:06.303 --> 29:07.714
I thought you might.

29:09.057 --> 29:10.221
All right.

29:11.060 --> 29:15.013
When I tell you, I want you to take
a deep breath in...

29:15.776 --> 29:19.480
...and blow out hard
as I pull out the tube.

29:19.699 --> 29:21.443
Can you do that for me?

29:22.370 --> 29:23.652
Okay.

29:27.252 --> 29:29.579
Breathe in...

29:30.257 --> 29:31.716
...and blow.

29:35.098 --> 29:37.507
Great. Great. That's better.

29:38.813 --> 29:40.723
No, don't try to speak.

29:40.941 --> 29:43.943
Tube's been in for over a week.
Your throat needs to adjust.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.118
Let me get you some ice chips.

29:52.793 --> 29:55.582
Can you ring the head neck surgeon
on call, please?

29:55.798 --> 29:58.291
Is it an emergency?
It's Christmas Eve.

29:58.511 --> 30:00.136
Just do it, okay?

30:01.473 --> 30:05.058
- Gina, have you been tested for HIV?
- No.

30:05.772 --> 30:06.887
You should.

30:07.108 --> 30:09.814
The boys are all in high school.
They don't have AIDS.

30:10.362 --> 30:14.529
That's not true. With your history
of chlamydia, you're at greater risk.

30:14.744 --> 30:17.072
- I gotta get home.
- I can draw some blood.

30:17.291 --> 30:18.750
No. I'm cool.

30:19.085 --> 30:23.500
Gina, look, if you are HIV-positive
and you decide to have this child...

30:23.717 --> 30:26.341
...you'll want to protect it
against infection.

30:27.014 --> 30:31.477
Drugs will help reduce the chances
of passing the virus to your baby.

30:31.688 --> 30:36.353
Look, I don't have AIDS. I don't
sleep with gay guys or druggies.

30:37.196 --> 30:39.405
Neither did I.

30:40.452 --> 30:42.826
- You have AIDS?
- I'm HIV-positive.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.873
How long will the test take?

30:50.176 --> 30:53.428
- Chuny, someone page me for a consult?
- Not that I know of.

30:54.850 --> 30:57.140
Oh, no.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.602
He wouldn't calm down
until I called you.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.614
- What?
- You won't believe this.

31:04.825 --> 31:06.023
He's blind again.

31:06.243 --> 31:08.368
No nystagmus with opticokinetic drum.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.289
Is that him? Is that Dr. Benton?

31:10.500 --> 31:12.244
- What's his name again?
- Bart.

31:12.754 --> 31:14.462
I can't see no more, doc.

31:15.425 --> 31:17.218
You have to touch me again.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.630
Look straight ahead, Bart.

31:28.737 --> 31:32.156
You have to touch me, doc. Please?

31:33.161 --> 31:35.998
Do like you done before. Touch me.

31:39.129 --> 31:40.292
Okay.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.007
Try again.

31:43.177 --> 31:45.005
Okay, let's get him up for a CT.

31:45.222 --> 31:49.388
One more time, doc!
Try it again, please! One more time.

31:49.813 --> 31:53.148
I'll dress this. An orthopedist
will look at your ankle...

31:53.360 --> 31:56.113
...and we'll admit you
for observation.

31:56.824 --> 31:59.398
They'll be so disappointed.

31:59.661 --> 32:00.991
I'm sorry?

32:02.165 --> 32:05.002
I play the organ at church.

32:05.546 --> 32:08.632
They always have an organ
for Christmas Mass.

32:08.842 --> 32:10.504
I'm sure they'll understand.

32:10.972 --> 32:13.760
Probably too late
to find a substitute.

32:13.977 --> 32:16.350
You have to stop worrying about Mass.

32:16.522 --> 32:18.848
You've been through something
horrible.

32:19.527 --> 32:22.815
- I don't want to talk about that.
- You don't have to.

32:24.618 --> 32:27.194
It's so hard.

32:28.291 --> 32:30.449
I'm so angry.

32:32.380 --> 32:36.132
I hate him, whoever he is.

32:36.346 --> 32:38.255
There's nothing wrong with that.

32:40.935 --> 32:42.728
I can't be like that.

32:44.567 --> 32:46.726
I have to forgive.

32:48.155 --> 32:50.445
You don't have to forgive anybody.

32:51.077 --> 32:53.534
He did this. Not you.

32:55.501 --> 32:57.161
Hating him...

32:57.587 --> 32:59.914
...won't make this go away.

33:02.595 --> 33:05.348
I'm afraid nothing'll make it go away.

33:10.566 --> 33:13.355
Can you cover my last half-hour?
I gotta do something.

33:13.571 --> 33:15.861
- What is it?
- I covered for you this morning.

33:16.075 --> 33:18.531
And you have that attending
from Synergix to help.

33:18.745 --> 33:21.202
- Sure. I'd be happy to.
- Okay.

33:22.126 --> 33:25.332
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah. Merry Christmas.

33:27.384 --> 33:29.177
Hey, you leaving?

33:31.766 --> 33:34.935
I gotta do this thing.
Can you take the El home?

33:35.272 --> 33:36.517
To your home, right?

33:36.774 --> 33:40.442
I don't know. I'm gonna have to
call you later, okay?

33:40.947 --> 33:42.277
Okay.

33:45.245 --> 33:48.414
I'm sorry I've been so busy.
Did you see anything interesting?

33:48.626 --> 33:50.787
It's been a very enlightening
experience.

33:51.005 --> 33:54.708
- Anything else you'd like to see?
- I've seen everything I needed to.

33:54.929 --> 33:57.301
- May I use your phone?
- Yes, of course.

33:57.515 --> 33:59.843
There's a potluck dinner
if you'd like to stay.

34:00.061 --> 34:01.639
No, thank you.

34:03.191 --> 34:05.649
- Is she upset?
- I'm not sure.

34:08.492 --> 34:11.743
Oh, John. I'm ready to leave.
Where's your cousin?

34:11.955 --> 34:13.783
Maybe he's still handing out gifts.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.329
- Talking about Santa?
- Yeah.

34:15.543 --> 34:17.786
He went out for some fresh air.

34:19.507 --> 34:21.503
Santa, you in there?

34:22.847 --> 34:24.925
- What is this?
- It's nothing.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.679
- Nothing?
- Shut the door.

34:30.067 --> 34:33.022
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

34:33.197 --> 34:35.405
It's a little stocking stuffer.

34:35.618 --> 34:37.527
This isn't funny.

34:37.704 --> 34:41.574
- How long you been doing this?
- John, just chill out.

34:41.793 --> 34:45.331
I'm not an addict.
I just do it when I'm bored, okay?

34:47.053 --> 34:50.007
I cannot believe how stupid I was!

34:50.350 --> 34:51.726
A spider bite.

34:52.478 --> 34:54.851
That was from skin popping.
You lied to me?

34:55.065 --> 34:58.151
- Can you blame me?
- Come on, you're smarter than this.

34:58.445 --> 34:59.726
I got it under control.

34:59.947 --> 35:02.654
So does every street junkie
coming through here.

35:02.869 --> 35:07.249
I am not a street junkie.
And I buy pure stuff.

35:07.418 --> 35:09.793
You know, I don't care how pure it is.

35:10.006 --> 35:12.498
Thank you for the medical advice,
doctor.

35:12.718 --> 35:15.258
But I'd prefer it
if you were just my cousin.

35:17.309 --> 35:19.718
Taken to hiding out in cars,
have we?

35:20.398 --> 35:23.566
Filling in for Grandfather doesn't
entitle you to his bad habits.

35:23.778 --> 35:25.771
I had some work I had to do.

35:26.366 --> 35:27.861
Or his excuses.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.417
Something the matter?

35:36.131 --> 35:38.623
No. I had better get back.

35:39.344 --> 35:42.632
Come early tonight.
Your grandfather wants to talk to you.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.185
I'll try.

35:44.853 --> 35:47.606
That is one nasty-looking
craniopharyngioma.

35:47.815 --> 35:50.308
Right here, compressing against
the optic chiasm.

35:50.487 --> 35:52.147
That explains the blindness.

35:52.323 --> 35:54.614
From its size,
it's been growing for years.

35:54.827 --> 35:56.867
How do you account
for temporary sight?

35:57.081 --> 36:00.416
- Sometimes the mind plays tricks.
- Head trauma could've caused it?

36:01.421 --> 36:03.664
Or maybe it triggered
some visual memory.

36:03.841 --> 36:06.678
No, he could see. Trust me.
I was there. I saw it.

36:06.888 --> 36:10.342
I don't know what to tell you.
From the evidence in front of me...

36:10.519 --> 36:14.138
...there's no way he's seen anything
for five or six years.

36:16.153 --> 36:18.479
Lizzie? I thought you'd be
over the Atlantic.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.324
Slight change of plans.

36:20.535 --> 36:22.409
Did I make you miss your flight?

36:22.621 --> 36:26.158
No, I just decided on spending
Christmas in Chicago after all.

36:26.794 --> 36:28.041
Awesome.

36:28.965 --> 36:30.709
I'm on my way to a party.

36:31.343 --> 36:35.426
A friend is renting out the entire
top floor of the Prudential Building.

36:35.642 --> 36:38.134
You want to come along?

36:38.521 --> 36:42.604
Thank you, but no. I'm waiting
on a head-and-neck consult.

36:42.820 --> 36:43.900
The Beaumont girl.

36:44.113 --> 36:47.900
Yes. I'm afraid her vocal cords
might be paralyzed.

36:48.329 --> 36:51.534
Well, don't hold your breath,
on the consult, that is.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.666
He's probably on his way to a party
somewhere himself.

36:54.881 --> 36:56.424
Just the same.

36:56.592 --> 36:57.707
Maybe New Year's Eve.

36:58.845 --> 37:00.092
Lovely.

37:01.391 --> 37:04.928
Three things to say: Gladys Knight,
Atlantic City, fourth row.

37:05.105 --> 37:06.434
What do you want?

37:06.607 --> 37:10.773
My friend has tickets for New Year's.
You gotta get someone to cover for me.

37:10.989 --> 37:12.401
What're you doing tomorrow?

37:12.617 --> 37:14.861
- Is there a Carol Hathaway?
- I'm her.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.872
Holiday Design. Delivery for you.

37:17.041 --> 37:18.370
- Where is it?
- Outside.

37:18.543 --> 37:20.122
- Bring it in.
- It won't fit.

37:23.217 --> 37:24.380
- That's a tree!
- Gorgeous.

37:24.553 --> 37:26.214
I can't believe they got it
in here.

37:27.474 --> 37:30.227
- Sign here.
- Thank you so much.

37:30.897 --> 37:33.436
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you too.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.443
Who is this from?

37:35.654 --> 37:38.527
"Happy Holidays from
the Carter Family Foundation. "

37:38.701 --> 37:40.077
- Oh, my God!
- What?

37:40.287 --> 37:43.040
- It's a check.
- A hundred and fifty grand!

37:43.417 --> 37:46.585
- Oh, my God!
- I guess she liked it here!

38:15.801 --> 38:18.210
Hi, I'm Mark Greene.
I'm the doctor-

38:18.389 --> 38:19.718
I know who you are.

38:20.892 --> 38:22.223
Yes.

38:22.812 --> 38:24.188
I'm very sorry for your loss.

38:24.398 --> 38:26.726
It's Christmas Eve, Dr. Greene.

38:27.236 --> 38:28.517
I know.

38:36.710 --> 38:38.749
What the hell you doing here?

38:40.298 --> 38:43.254
- I came to apologize.
- I thought you was above all that.

38:43.888 --> 38:47.591
- Your uptown lawyer, he blew us off.
- He was wrong.

38:48.938 --> 38:50.812
I was wrong.

38:52.192 --> 38:56.324
I can't tell you if my assumption about
your brother was racism or experience.

38:56.492 --> 38:58.200
Probably both.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.197
I can tell you that I used you.

39:04.420 --> 39:05.880
It wasn't you.

39:06.090 --> 39:08.048
No. Feel better now?

39:10.013 --> 39:11.259
Maybe.

39:13.058 --> 39:14.471
Can't front though.

39:15.313 --> 39:17.390
I was glad when I heard
you got beat down.

39:18.694 --> 39:20.319
I wanted you to hurt.

39:23.492 --> 39:28.406
But whether you get messed up
or we get a million dollars...

39:29.459 --> 39:30.741
...my brother's still dead.

39:32.799 --> 39:35.006
Some punk dealer shot him.

39:36.848 --> 39:38.757
And there's no meaning in that.

39:39.852 --> 39:41.181
I'm sorry.

39:58.089 --> 39:59.465
Dr. Benton?

39:59.633 --> 40:01.792
Yeah. How'd you know?

40:02.013 --> 40:03.591
Your shoes squeak.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.596
You've come to give me the bad news?

40:10.985 --> 40:13.559
You have a very large brain tumor.

40:13.989 --> 40:15.948
It's what caused the blindness.

40:16.159 --> 40:19.364
It's operable, but because
of the place and size...

40:19.833 --> 40:21.742
...it's difficult to completely
remove.

40:21.960 --> 40:24.998
However, with a little radiation,
there is...

40:26.718 --> 40:28.677
...a good chance of survival.

40:29.014 --> 40:31.850
So I'll be able to see again?

40:32.351 --> 40:35.853
Well, once the tumor is extracted,
it's possible...

40:36.233 --> 40:37.479
...but highly unlikely.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.814
It was highly unlikely I'd see today.

40:41.031 --> 40:43.359
Medically, that was impossible.

40:43.870 --> 40:47.157
I spent all afternoon in the park,
you know?

40:47.375 --> 40:49.416
Just watching.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.291
Santos playing in the snow...

40:53.051 --> 40:55.342
...and steam coming up
off the water...

40:55.556 --> 41:00.351
...and the way snow falls
lightly on the trees.

41:02.107 --> 41:03.519
It's beautiful, isn't it?

41:07.157 --> 41:08.736
Yeah. I guess so.

41:10.788 --> 41:12.118
Trust me...

41:13.543 --> 41:14.918
...it's beautiful.

41:19.427 --> 41:22.098
- Hello.
- Hey! Good day?

41:22.765 --> 41:25.139
It ended good.
Guess who got tomorrow off?

41:25.353 --> 41:28.355
- Flexed a little muscle?
- I had to give up New Year's.

41:28.566 --> 41:29.978
But it's worth it.

41:30.194 --> 41:31.606
Oh, no.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.395
What?

41:33.825 --> 41:36.399
I volunteered to work
for Anna tomorrow.

41:36.578 --> 41:37.741
She's an intern.

41:37.955 --> 41:41.659
I just thought maybe we'd
spend more time together.

41:41.879 --> 41:44.917
- You didn't!
- No, I didn't. That's a lie.

41:45.676 --> 41:47.967
- Romantic though, wasn't it?
- Well, yeah.

41:49.266 --> 41:50.975
You're looking at what?

41:51.311 --> 41:52.343
Come here.

41:52.563 --> 41:54.805
Can I have your attention, everybody?

41:54.983 --> 41:58.769
Can I have your attention, please?
I have an announcement to make.

41:58.989 --> 42:00.734
Turn down that music.

42:01.202 --> 42:05.071
Okay. I've kept this a secret
far too long.

42:05.250 --> 42:07.327
Doug Ross and I are
seeing each other again.

42:08.421 --> 42:09.833
Yeah?

42:11.843 --> 42:14.383
- And we're very happy.
- Okay, pay up, pay up.

42:14.598 --> 42:16.674
I was a week too late.
I thought New Year's.

42:16.851 --> 42:18.892
I'm surprised they kept it
a secret this long.

42:19.063 --> 42:21.270
- You knew?
- Please, it was obvious.

42:21.483 --> 42:23.359
- I didn't know.
- Me either.

42:23.529 --> 42:26.651
Maybe something that you guys
didn't know is that...

42:26.868 --> 42:30.653
...we've been seeing each other
for a little while now, again...

42:30.874 --> 42:34.161
...and I think it would be great
if she were to marry me.

42:36.215 --> 42:38.458
Help me talk her into it.

42:38.885 --> 42:41.177
To Carol and Doug.
Get it right this time.

42:41.807 --> 42:43.137
Congratulations!

42:43.351 --> 42:44.516
Yeah, hear, hear!

42:46.773 --> 42:50.192
- You always have to outdo me.
- I had the opportunity and I took it.

42:50.405 --> 42:53.574
- Congratulations, I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

42:53.743 --> 42:55.737
Let's move this party outside.

42:55.955 --> 42:58.578
- You gonna stay till I get off work?
- Hell, no.

43:09.100 --> 43:11.890
Meet me at the airport
or I'll take you myself.

43:12.106 --> 43:14.396
I didn't pack my bathing suit.

43:14.610 --> 43:17.019
Don't worry. I know a private beach.

43:17.990 --> 43:20.827
- Merry Christmas, Kerry.
- Yeah. You too.

43:21.036 --> 43:24.205
- So you got plans tonight?
- Yeah, I plan to be alone.

43:24.417 --> 43:25.698
You want some company?

43:25.919 --> 43:27.830
Don't you have a family obligation?

43:28.048 --> 43:30.255
I've had enough family for one day.

43:30.468 --> 43:32.379
John?

43:33.515 --> 43:36.803
Listen, I got the blood gas
on the asthmatic in 3.

43:37.020 --> 43:38.350
Only took me two sticks.

43:38.564 --> 43:41.058
Put it on ice
and run it up to the lab.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.776
- Okay.
- Hey, Henry!

43:45.368 --> 43:49.152
- Merry Christmas.
- John, I didn't get you anything.

43:49.666 --> 43:51.660
It's your evaluation.
Congratulations!

43:51.836 --> 43:54.163
You just passed Emergency Medicine.

43:54.382 --> 43:56.007
I don't know what to say.

43:56.218 --> 43:58.508
Do me a favor?
Stick to brain research.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.712
I promise.

43:59.932 --> 44:02.603
I will. Thank you, John.
Thank you.

44:02.770 --> 44:06.472
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

44:09.698 --> 44:11.656
- Thank you.
- Henry.

44:11.826 --> 44:13.321
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:13.495 --> 44:15.370
- Good night.
- Good night.
