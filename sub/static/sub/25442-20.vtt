check it out.

19:25.580 --> 19:28.040
Mitch, what are you doing
with Principal Kwan's
Peanut statue?

19:28.040 --> 19:29.120
Huh!

19:29.960 --> 19:32.460
Yeah, that's a very good
question, ambassador.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.670
I didn't take your Peanut.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.250
Then why
are you holding it?

19:36.250 --> 19:38.580
Taking the Principal's Peanut
doesn't seem like something

19:38.580 --> 19:39.580
an ambassador would do.

19:39.580 --> 19:41.580
I'm not an ambassador.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.920
And you never will be.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.960
Oh, it so hurts
when a Peanut goes bad.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.710
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
call your father, Mitchell.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.080
(sighs)

19:55.960 --> 19:58.830
It's okay, little Peanut.
Mama's got you now.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.580
Great.

20:02.580 --> 20:05.540
My dad said if I
get in trouble
one more time,

20:05.540 --> 20:07.540
he's gonna send me
to military school.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.500
Military school? Please.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.080
We don't believe you, Mitch.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.670
No, I'm serious.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.750
I know you guys
probably think my life
is all winning,

20:16.750 --> 20:19.330
but when I lose--
which is rare

20:19.710 --> 20:20.880
I lose big.

20:23.170 --> 20:25.120
Can this day
get any worse?

20:25.460 --> 20:26.580
(ripping noises)

20:27.580 --> 20:31.210
Ah, great!

20:31.210 --> 20:33.000
Now I gotta spend
my last day of freedom

20:33.000 --> 20:34.540
walking around
getting laughed at

20:34.540 --> 20:36.290
'cause I'm wearing
a ripped shirt.

20:38.460 --> 20:41.040
You know, I actually
feel bad for him.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.620
How are we gonna fix this?

20:42.620 --> 20:43.750
Well, first thing's first.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.380
We definitely can't let him
walk around like that.

20:46.380 --> 20:49.580
"I will graciously help
any Peanut in need."

20:49.920 --> 20:52.790
I guess my vision
wasn't about him stealing
our ambassadorship.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.250
He just needed you
to give him your jacket.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.420
Hey, why can't you
give him your jacket?

20:58.420 --> 20:59.620
Fine.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.380
But there must be a reason
he was wearing yours.

21:02.580 --> 21:03.710
Here you go, Mitch.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.460
Don't give me the stinky one.

21:07.170 --> 21:08.250
And there it is.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.580
I guess according
to this pledge card,

21:14.580 --> 21:16.670
there is one more thing
that we need to do.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.790
And that's why
we were the ones

21:20.790 --> 21:23.170
who put your Peanut
in Mitch's locker.

21:23.170 --> 21:25.960
We were just so afraid
of losing our ambassadorship,

21:25.960 --> 21:30.250
that we ended up not acting
like good ambassadors at all.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.920
And, yeah. I guess
we don't deserve

21:32.920 --> 21:34.500
to have our names
on that wall of fame.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.040
No, you don't.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.750
But I chose you both
for a reason.

21:39.750 --> 21:42.250
I've known you kids
since you were little Peanuts.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.790
And I know
what you're made of.

21:44.540 --> 21:47.710
And while you didn't live up
to the oath you took,

21:47.710 --> 21:49.790
having the courage
to come here now

21:49.790 --> 21:51.790
and tell me the truth
to help another Peanut

21:51.790 --> 21:53.620
is very ambassadorial.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.250
And so...

21:56.250 --> 21:57.670
I'm gonna give you
another chance

21:57.670 --> 22:00.120
to prove you deserve
to wear these blazers.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.710
Thank you so much,
Principle Kwan.

22:01.710 --> 22:02.920
Yeah, we won't
let you down.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.500
I'm counting on it.

22:05.420 --> 22:06.330
Go, Peanuts.

22:06.330 --> 22:07.830
Both:
Go Peanuts!

22:08.670 --> 22:12.120
No, I meant...
Go, peanuts.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.750
-Yeah, right.
-Yeah, we knew that.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.080
-Yeah, thank you.
-Okay.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.710
And kids,

22:18.210 --> 22:20.620
if you can find that bird
that's been hanging around,

22:20.620 --> 22:22.290
there may be
a little extra bacon

22:22.290 --> 22:23.710
at the next breakfast for you.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.250
I'm on it.

22:30.290 --> 22:31.580
I know. Right, Chels?

22:31.580 --> 22:34.040
Okay, okay.
I got good news
and I got bad news.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.670
You sure you want
the bad news?

22:35.670 --> 22:36.750
Okay, alright, Chels.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.790
Listen, the bad news is...

22:38.790 --> 22:40.120
Your garden's
taking a dirt nap.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.750
But the good news is
that Chance the Rapper

22:41.750 --> 22:43.040
liked my flower pot hat.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.120
(knocking at door)

22:44.120 --> 22:45.250
Oh!

22:45.250 --> 22:46.710
Look, yeah.
I know. I'm sorry.

22:46.710 --> 22:47.880
I'm sorry, Chels!

22:47.880 --> 22:49.250
Hold on, hold on.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.290
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you in school?

22:53.750 --> 22:56.830
Ah, that place
really wasn't for me.

22:56.830 --> 22:58.750
So I decided
to be home schooled.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.540
I'm on recess.

23:00.540 --> 23:02.170
Wanna play?
