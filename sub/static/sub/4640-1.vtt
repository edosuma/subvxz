WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.837
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

00:05.547 --> 00:09.633
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready to rock?

00:09.801 --> 00:13.929
Welcome to the famous Bourbon Room
on the Sunset Strip:

00:14.097 --> 00:18.392
Stacee Jaxx and Arsenal!

00:18.560 --> 00:19.852
Hey, Los Angeles!

00:21.229 --> 00:24.440
This is a little song called
"Paradise City."

00:30.947 --> 00:34.908
Just an urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat

00:35.076 --> 00:37.786
I'm your charity case
So buy me something to eat

00:37.954 --> 00:41.040
I'll pay you at another time

00:41.541 --> 00:43.375
Take it to the end of the line

00:44.127 --> 00:46.295
Take me down to the paradise city

00:46.463 --> 00:48.672
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty

00:48.840 --> 00:51.925
Take me home

00:52.093 --> 00:53.343
Yeah, yeah

00:53.511 --> 00:56.472
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green

01:41.976 --> 01:46.396
Sister Christian
Oh, the time has come

01:47.524 --> 01:53.278
And you know that you're the only one
To say

01:54.114 --> 01:55.781
Okay

01:58.201 --> 02:03.038
Where you going?
What you looking for?

02:03.206 --> 02:07.376
You know those boys
Don't want to play no more

02:07.544 --> 02:09.711
With you

02:10.130 --> 02:12.130
It's true

02:21.391 --> 02:23.809
Yeah

02:23.977 --> 02:26.478
You're motoring

02:26.771 --> 02:30.023
What's your price for flight?

02:31.651 --> 02:35.404
In finding Mr. Right

02:37.031 --> 02:40.367
You'll be all right tonight

03:30.501 --> 03:35.964
This must be just like livin' in paradise

03:37.342 --> 03:41.220
And I don't wanna go home

03:44.182 --> 03:49.645
This must be just like livin' in paradise

03:51.064 --> 03:54.733
And I don't wanna go home

03:56.194 --> 03:57.653
Hey, hey!

04:02.533 --> 04:04.409
Yeah, yeah, yeah

04:04.744 --> 04:08.664
Girl, you've been meant for this
Since you were born

04:08.831 --> 04:10.415
Since she was born

04:10.583 --> 04:12.209
No problem now

04:12.377 --> 04:13.877
The coast is clear

04:14.045 --> 04:18.507
It's just the calm before the storm

04:18.675 --> 04:22.427
This must be just like livin' in paradise

04:23.805 --> 04:25.180
Paradise

04:25.348 --> 04:33.348
And I don't wanna go home

04:35.984 --> 04:38.485
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent

04:38.653 --> 04:41.697
I can barely make it through the week

04:42.615 --> 04:45.701
Saturday night I'd like to meet my girl

04:45.868 --> 04:48.996
But right now I can't make ends meet

04:49.497 --> 04:53.542
I'm always workin'
Slavin' every day

04:53.710 --> 04:57.629
Gotta get a break
From the same old same old

04:57.797 --> 05:00.424
I need a chance just to get away

05:00.591 --> 05:04.011
If you could hear me think
This is what I'd say

05:04.178 --> 05:08.223
Don't need nothin' but a good time

05:08.683 --> 05:11.226
How can I resist?

05:11.394 --> 05:15.314
Ain't lookin' for nothin'
But a good time

05:15.481 --> 05:18.900
And it don't get better than this

05:21.446 --> 05:23.780
Come on, son. Up you get!

05:26.659 --> 05:28.201
Go to rehab!

05:28.369 --> 05:30.662
Yo, Lonny,
how come you never take out the trash?

05:30.830 --> 05:34.249
I leave that to you. You're a musician,
so it's important that you suffer.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.336
I'm talentless,
so suffering's wasted on me.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.589
- When was the last time you suffered?
- Six o'clock this evening...

05:40.757 --> 05:42.591
when I got up for work.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.387
Say I spend my money
On women and wine

05:48.264 --> 05:50.932
But I couldn't tell you where
I spent last night

05:51.934 --> 05:54.394
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in

05:54.562 --> 05:58.023
I just-a like my fun every now and then

05:58.316 --> 06:02.402
I'm always workin'
Slavin' every day

06:02.570 --> 06:06.031
Gotta get a break
From the same old same old

06:06.741 --> 06:09.159
I need a chance just to get away

06:09.327 --> 06:12.871
If you could hear me think
This is what I'd say

06:13.039 --> 06:17.250
Don't need nothin' but a good time

06:17.418 --> 06:19.503
How can I resist?

06:19.712 --> 06:23.799
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time

06:23.966 --> 06:28.011
And it don't get better than this

06:28.262 --> 06:29.638
Dennis! Dennis!

06:29.806 --> 06:32.307
You see, I raise a toast to all of us

06:33.226 --> 06:35.977
Who are breakin' our backs every day

06:37.397 --> 06:40.440
If wantin' the good life is such a crime

06:40.942 --> 06:43.819
A-Lord, then put me away

06:43.986 --> 06:45.529
Here's to ya

06:58.668 --> 07:04.214
- Don't need nothin' but a good time
- Oh, yeah, yeah

07:05.341 --> 07:07.217
Hey, baby, come on, give me a kiss.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.052
- Drew!
- Come on, give me a kiss! Hey!

07:09.220 --> 07:10.929
- Come on!
- Drew!

07:11.097 --> 07:12.973
- Get him out!
- Come on.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.352
- I've had enough of this! Tell Dennis I quit!
- Beth! Come on!

07:17.520 --> 07:20.147
Livin' in paradise

07:21.983 --> 07:28.029
And I don't wanna go home

07:28.197 --> 07:29.781
I love her, man! Come on!

07:34.745 --> 07:36.663
You're all gonna go to hell!

07:37.498 --> 07:38.540
Hey.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.792
- Where you from?
- Oklahoma.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.878
Well, welcome to Hollywood.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.213
- Thanks.
- Give me that!

07:45.381 --> 07:47.382
- Let go! Come on! Let me have it!
- No! No!

07:47.550 --> 07:49.050
- Hey!
- Give me it!

07:49.218 --> 07:50.719
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone!

07:50.887 --> 07:53.430
Wait! Oh, stop! Please! Somebody!

07:53.598 --> 07:55.849
No. No. No.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.267
Are you okay?

07:57.435 --> 07:58.477
Shit.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.979
- Did he take your money?
- He took my records.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.355
Oh, my God.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.943
Look, I'm sorry this happened. It sucks.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.361
I'm Drew.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.614
Sherrie.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.700
"The Bourbon Room"?

08:13.868 --> 08:16.578
- You work at The Bourbon Room?
- Yeah. I'm a barback.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.499
One of these days,
my name's gonna be up there.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.584
- You're in a band?
- I'm a singer.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.127
Get out! Me too.

08:24.295 --> 08:28.715
Oh, my God. The Bourbon Room. I have,
like, 10 albums that were recorded there.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.425
More like "had"?

08:34.138 --> 08:35.514
Had.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.849
Yep.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.309
Well, thank you.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.270
Thanks.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.522
Again.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.360
Don't go in there, it's filth!

08:51.364 --> 08:53.281
- Hey.
- Don't join them!

08:53.491 --> 08:56.535
Do you need a job?
I could talk to Dennis Dupree, my boss.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.286
Pray you'll be saved!

08:58.454 --> 08:59.746
Are you serious?

08:59.914 --> 09:03.041
Just whatever you do,
don't tell him you're a singer.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.341
Jimmy!

09:11.509 --> 09:14.970
I told you 10,000 times.
Girls drink free, dudes pay full freight.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.765
They are dudes.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.812
Look, I haven't charged a girl since '73.

09:26.023 --> 09:29.234
For a minute, I thought that
Kate Jackson from Charlie's Angels...

09:29.402 --> 09:32.153
- ...had walked into my club.
- More like Michael Jackson.

09:32.321 --> 09:35.240
- Doesn't he look pale to you?
- He does a bit.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.951
Dennis! Meet Sherrie.
She needs a job, man.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.078
No, I don't think so. She's a singer.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.997
No, she just came in
from out of town.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.582
Oh, okay, now, if I may.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.293
- You sang in the church choir every Sunday.
- Lutheran.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.421
Senior year, you had the third lead
in your high school musical.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.382
- Sound of Music.
- And then somebody...

09:52.550 --> 09:55.719
your adorable Aunt Betty,
told you you had real talent.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.055
It was actually my Aunt Doris.

09:59.223 --> 10:03.518
And like a flaming dipshit you believed
her, dumped your jock boyfriend...

10:03.686 --> 10:07.772
ditched town and moved to Hollywood
to have a crack at fame and fortune.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.399
Am I missing anything?

10:11.027 --> 10:12.319
I...

10:12.486 --> 10:13.653
Yeah, okay.

10:16.991 --> 10:20.118
Actually, my boyfriend
wasn't really athletic.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.287
And look. I'm a waitress.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.498
Come on. She's practically
got mike burns on her lips.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.710
I'm not interested, sweetheart.
I need you two to get back to work.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.422
- Please, Mr. Dupree. I'm a hard worker.
- You seem like a really nice kid.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.632
I just got mugged.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.385
I have $17 to my name and I'm probably
gonna be starving in the next 48 hours.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.055
- And Beth just quit.
- Beth just quit?

10:42.308 --> 10:44.517
Okay, fine. You're hired.

10:44.685 --> 10:47.103
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.899
What are you thanking me for? I ruined
your life. You start training tomorrow.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.902
This place is turning into a war zone.
It's Arsenal's last show.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.946
Arsenal? Oh, my God, I love Stacee Jaxx.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.783
It's your lucky day. He's going solo.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.535
Hey, want to go celebrate?
I'm coming up on my break.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.037
Yeah. Sure.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.834
A year ago...

11:10.002 --> 11:11.920
A year ago,
people asked whose campaign...

11:12.088 --> 11:14.506
I would throw
my financial support behind...

11:14.674 --> 11:17.092
and I knew there was only one man
on the ticket...

11:17.259 --> 11:19.719
that could restore the city
to its original glory.

11:19.887 --> 11:24.474
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mayor Mike Whitmore.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.936
Thank you. Couldn't have done it
without you, Doug.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.439
Thank you, Los Angeles.

11:34.151 --> 11:37.153
You know, Doug Flintlock here...

11:38.698 --> 11:42.409
well, he just leaned into my ear
and he said:

11:42.576 --> 11:46.413
"Mike, I have kids. Teenagers."

11:46.580 --> 11:49.666
And these days, I'm scared for them.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.211
"We need to clean up this city."

11:54.046 --> 11:55.755
Well, I can tell you that...

11:55.923 --> 11:59.467
I, for one, am not scared
for our city's children.

11:59.969 --> 12:04.139
And that's because
I have a secret weapon.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.391
My rock.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.976
My soul mate.

12:08.185 --> 12:12.063
And the best darn wife
any man could hope to have.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.566
Please welcome my wife:

12:14.734 --> 12:16.526
The beautiful Patricia Whitmore!

12:19.572 --> 12:21.406
Come on up here, Patty-cake!

12:22.324 --> 12:23.658
We did it!

12:25.327 --> 12:27.746
Oh. Thank you.

12:29.039 --> 12:32.917
Today, the city of Los Angeles
gets a twofer!

12:33.419 --> 12:37.756
Not only the best mayor this city
has ever had...

12:37.923 --> 12:39.674
but also me.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.634
A mother.

12:42.136 --> 12:46.473
So tomorrow, as part of my
"Clean Up The Strip" initiative...

12:46.640 --> 12:49.517
we start to make this city safe
again for our young people.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.687
She looks familiar to me, this woman.
She looks eerily familiar.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.774
You've probably popped something on
your ass that resembles her.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.611
I shouldn't have thought so. That's all
cleared up nicely, thank you very much.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.740
Rock 'n' roll is a disease.
But it is a disease with a cure.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.033
You don't know her.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.912
Man, back then, her husband,
Mayor Whitmore...

13:09.079 --> 13:11.539
used to be one of my best customers.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.334
Now look at him.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.212
Married to a woman
who looks like she's been hibernating...

13:17.379 --> 13:19.255
in Margaret Thatcher's bumhole.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.008
Off our streets
and knock the sucker back...

13:22.176 --> 13:24.135
What happens to people?

13:24.303 --> 13:25.470
Don't know, Den.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.015
Suppose they get corrupted
and seduced by the Man...

13:29.183 --> 13:31.518
get old and bitter and run for mayor.

13:31.685 --> 13:34.062
Or they run a club,
live the rock 'n' roll dream...

13:34.230 --> 13:37.649
and get old and bitter that way.
Here's to rock 'n' roll.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.858
To rock 'n' roll.

13:39.026 --> 13:43.363
And let's reclaim the Strip for the
God-fearing citizens of Los Angeles!

13:58.963 --> 14:02.131
I cannot believe
that I'm working at The Bourbon.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.675
Thank you so much.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.176
Don't even mention it.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.762
Oh, my God.
Arsenal Live at The Bourbon.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.723
- Hands down, favorite record ever.
- Me too.

14:10.891 --> 14:14.769
I would've killed to be at that concert.
That record really changed my life.

14:14.937 --> 14:18.189
I decided if I couldn't see Stacee Jaxx...

14:18.357 --> 14:20.191
I was gonna be Stacee Jaxx.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.529
Bought a beat-up six string

14:24.780 --> 14:26.364
In a secondhand store

14:27.283 --> 14:29.033
Didn't know how to play it

14:29.952 --> 14:31.619
But I knew for sure

14:32.496 --> 14:34.497
That one guitar

14:34.957 --> 14:37.500
Felt good in my hands

14:38.043 --> 14:40.003
Didn't take long

14:40.170 --> 14:42.547
To understand

14:42.798 --> 14:44.007
Just one guitar

14:45.342 --> 14:47.135
Slung way down low

14:47.970 --> 14:49.304
Was a one-way ticket

14:50.681 --> 14:52.640
Only one way to go

14:52.975 --> 14:55.518
- So I started rockin'
- Rockin'

14:55.686 --> 14:57.478
Ain't never gonna stop
No

14:58.647 --> 15:00.982
- Gotta keep on rockin'
- Rockin'

15:01.150 --> 15:04.152
Someday I'm gonna make it to the top
And sing

15:04.320 --> 15:06.654
I love rock 'n' roll

15:06.822 --> 15:09.324
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

15:09.491 --> 15:11.743
I love rock 'n' roll

15:11.911 --> 15:14.996
So come and take your time
And dance with me

15:15.873 --> 15:18.082
In a town with no name

15:18.417 --> 15:20.418
In a heavy downpour

15:20.836 --> 15:22.670
Thought I passed my own shadow

15:23.505 --> 15:25.590
By the backstage door

15:25.925 --> 15:27.717
Like a trip through the past

15:28.385 --> 15:30.345
To that day in the rain

15:31.055 --> 15:32.847
And that one guitar

15:33.682 --> 15:36.935
Made my whole life change

15:37.102 --> 15:40.521
And we'll be movin' on and singin'
That same old song

15:40.689 --> 15:42.231
Yeah, with me Singin'

15:42.399 --> 15:44.901
And be a jukebox hero

15:45.069 --> 15:47.445
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

15:47.613 --> 15:50.073
I'm a jukebox hero

15:50.240 --> 15:52.450
So come and take your time
And dance with me

15:52.618 --> 15:55.036
- Just-a one guitar
- Jukebox hero

15:55.204 --> 15:57.914
Got stars in my eyes

15:58.082 --> 16:03.127
I'm just a jukebox hero...

16:03.295 --> 16:05.588
- Jukebox hero
- Stars, stars

16:05.756 --> 16:07.966
I love rock 'n' roll

16:08.133 --> 16:10.760
- Jukebox hero
- Stars, stars

16:10.928 --> 16:13.262
So come and take your time
And dance with me

16:13.430 --> 16:19.936
Stars in our eyes

16:21.230 --> 16:23.398
I love rock 'n' roll

16:44.503 --> 16:47.755
The problem is, I think I'll only ever
be good on a jukebox.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.173
What do you mean?

16:52.094 --> 16:53.803
I get stage fright.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.431
You've gotta be kidding me.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.266
No.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.601
You've gotta breathe.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.270
I think I got that part down.

17:02.438 --> 17:06.107
No, I'm serious, you've gotta breathe.
Like, takes away the nerves.

17:07.483 --> 17:11.319
Breathe in through your nose
and out through your mouth.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.239
Do it a couple times. You'll be fine.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.119
Maybe you should help me practice.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.669
Are you asking me out on a date?

17:27.838 --> 17:28.963
Yeah.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.468
Then yes.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.470
Cool.

17:36.138 --> 17:41.476
Okay, well, I should probably check
into my motel and grab my stuff, so...

17:41.643 --> 17:42.977
Gotta get back to work.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.188
- Okay, well, bye. Oh.
- Bye.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.149
Bye. Oh. Ha-ha.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.484
Sorry.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.322
Well, good night.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.199
See you tomorrow, Mrs. Whitmore.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.993
Mr. Whitmore. Call me.

18:00.954 --> 18:01.996
Mike?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.665
Why so jumpy?

18:04.833 --> 18:08.669
Well, it's just that Doug Flintlock.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.006
He wants the Strip, Patty-cake,
and we have to deliver.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.008
Of course we will, sweetheart.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.010
How?

18:16.845 --> 18:20.598
We'll go after the head of the snake.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.768
- The Bourbon.
- Oh, right.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.021
If we cut off the head, the Strip will die.

18:27.189 --> 18:31.734
The Bourbon could be a Benetton
by the end of the month.

18:33.153 --> 18:36.197
Now listen: Me and the ladies
are going after all the church groups...

18:36.365 --> 18:37.532
to make this happen.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.909
We're even talking
to the Health Department.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.620
We should review all their paperwork
for violations.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.871
Oh, trust me...

18:44.039 --> 18:46.791
if we find so much as a hair
in a cocktail olive...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.626
we're shutting them down.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.880
Hey, boss, we found some hairs
in the cocktail olives again.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.882
Then rinse them off.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.551
Okay.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.760
No!

18:57.928 --> 19:00.888
Nobody puts Donkey in the corner!

19:01.056 --> 19:03.516
That game's too bloody surreal anyway.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.560
Dennis, did you just sigh audibly? Why?

19:06.061 --> 19:09.230
Taxes. They're so un-rock 'n' roll.

19:09.523 --> 19:13.568
Cheer up, mate. You still got
the twisted sisters of piety outside...

19:13.735 --> 19:17.071
all flustered and worked up,
so we must be doing something right, eh?

19:17.239 --> 19:19.824
Well, at least we have
the Arsenal show coming up.

19:20.033 --> 19:24.328
But that means our whole existence
is riding on Stacee Jaxx.

19:24.538 --> 19:28.416
Stacee Jaxx, the most unreliable man
in the music industry?

19:28.584 --> 19:31.586
A man who blew off the halftime show
at the Super Bowl...

19:31.753 --> 19:34.922
to attend a satanic ritual
to sew up Debbie Harry's vagina?

19:35.090 --> 19:36.132
Please stop.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.093
- The Satanists wouldn't even do that.
- You're not helping.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.555
Why would the devil close vaginas?
No one's qualified to do that.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.764
Hand me the phone.

19:43.932 --> 19:48.102
Let's do a telethon, because this might
work better than your Stacee Jaxx idea.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.854
Shut it!

19:50.022 --> 19:52.523
I'm calling Stacee's manager, Paul Gill.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.282
- Speak.
- Hello, Paul? It's Dennis Dupree.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.284
Dennis. What's up, brother man?

20:03.452 --> 20:07.663
Oh, I was just calling to check in
and see if we're still on for Friday.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.333
Of course we are. Arsenal's last show.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.793
We're kicking off Stacee's
solo press tour there.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.795
Rolling Stone just confirmed.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.965
They would like to interview him
on the premises, okay?

20:18.133 --> 20:20.718
- What did he say?
- He told me to turn off the radio.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.803
- So turn it off.
- The radio in his head!

20:22.971 --> 20:24.472
- Calm down!
- Oh, God.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.240
Paul?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.109
- Paul?
- Oh, crap. Yeah, sorry, man.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.946
Yeah. Is Stacee okay?

20:40.113 --> 20:41.155
Stacee?

20:41.323 --> 20:45.493
He's fantastic. I'm looking at him
right now. He's waving hello.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.746
Yes, I'm talking to Dennis.
He just flipped me off.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.999
Same old Stacee. Right?
Okay, I gotta dash.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.543
I'll talk to you Friday, babe, okay?

20:54.836 --> 20:57.672
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

21:09.434 --> 21:11.811
Put something on, man.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.695
Banzai.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.363
Jesus.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.039
Stacee?

21:51.268 --> 21:53.394
I didn't know you had a twin.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.980
I don't.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.692
Stacee.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.572
You need to go on stage, man.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.908
I am on stage, Paul.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.248
Shit.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.626
Take a good look, ladies.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.420
Take a hard...

22:19.588 --> 22:22.006
good, long...

22:22.215 --> 22:23.591
hard...

22:23.759 --> 22:24.842
look.

22:25.010 --> 22:29.972
This man, this man is responsible
for so much filth.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.809
- He's Satan.
- She is an extraordinary woman.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.269
Such a beacon of courage.

22:35.437 --> 22:39.273
He's like a machine
that spews out three things:

22:40.275 --> 22:41.484
- Sex...
- Oh!

22:41.651 --> 22:44.153
- ...hateful music...
- Yes.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.363
And...

22:48.283 --> 22:49.283
sex!

22:49.826 --> 22:53.204
Can you come take some dictation
for me in the parish office, Ms. Hoyt?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.789
Of course, sir.

22:54.956 --> 22:58.000
My son ate the head of my neighbor's
horse because of Stacee Jaxx.

22:58.251 --> 23:04.131
Well, his filthy little hateful music...

23:04.299 --> 23:06.634
sex ride is over.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.969
- Gotta stop!
- Yes.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.639
And we're the ones who are gonna do it.

23:13.475 --> 23:17.853
Well, you're a real tough cookie
With a long history

23:18.021 --> 23:21.565
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me

23:22.818 --> 23:26.195
That's okay
Let's see how you do it

23:26.655 --> 23:30.491
Put up your dukes
Let's get down to it

23:32.786 --> 23:34.662
Hit me with your best shot

23:35.664 --> 23:38.791
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?

23:40.085 --> 23:42.294
Hit me with your best shot

23:42.879 --> 23:45.673
Fire away

23:47.384 --> 23:49.343
You come on with a come-on

23:49.511 --> 23:50.886
You don't fight fair

23:51.930 --> 23:54.849
That's okay
See if I care

23:55.016 --> 23:58.519
Knock me down
It's all in vain

23:58.687 --> 24:02.189
I'll get right back on my feet again

24:02.357 --> 24:04.900
Hit me with your best shot

24:05.527 --> 24:08.362
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?

24:09.823 --> 24:12.199
Hit me with your best shot

24:12.742 --> 24:15.035
Fire away

24:17.539 --> 24:18.539
Pow! Pow!

24:20.667 --> 24:22.042
Pow!

24:24.045 --> 24:27.882
Well, you're a real tough cookie
With a long history

24:28.633 --> 24:31.260
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me

24:31.428 --> 24:35.055
Before I put another notch
In my lipstick case

24:35.849 --> 24:39.310
You better make sure
You put me in my place

24:39.478 --> 24:41.896
Hit me with your best shot

24:42.564 --> 24:45.900
Come on!
Hit me with your best shot

24:47.110 --> 24:49.403
Hit me with your best shot

24:49.905 --> 24:53.741
Fire away

24:54.618 --> 24:56.952
Hit me with your best shot

24:57.746 --> 25:00.748
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?

25:01.917 --> 25:04.376
Hit me with your best shot

25:04.794 --> 25:10.132
Fire away

25:17.724 --> 25:19.058
Hah!

25:42.374 --> 25:46.126
- Ai! Jesus.
- No, Chico. Jesus is my brother.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.963
Oye, Dennis told me to tell you
to come in early tomorrow.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.506
Yeah, sure. Whatever, man.

25:50.674 --> 25:55.261
I need to go get ready. I have a big date
tonight with Sherrie. Wish me luck.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.681
Yeah, whatever that means. Okay, bye.

26:06.147 --> 26:09.483
So long

26:09.985 --> 26:15.155
I've been looking too hard
I've been waiting too long

26:15.365 --> 26:19.535
Sometimes I don't know
What I will find

26:20.161 --> 26:23.998
I only know it's a matter of time

26:24.374 --> 26:31.839
When you love someone

26:33.675 --> 26:38.345
It feels so right
So warm and true

26:38.597 --> 26:42.516
I need to know if you feel it too

26:44.352 --> 26:46.478
Maybe I'm wrong

26:46.980 --> 26:52.067
Won't you tell me
If I'm coming on too strong?

26:52.235 --> 26:56.739
This heart of mine has been hurt before

26:57.032 --> 27:00.034
This time I wanna be sure

27:00.201 --> 27:01.201
Hey, girl.

27:01.369 --> 27:05.873
I've been waitin' for a girl like you

27:06.041 --> 27:09.793
To come into my life

27:10.003 --> 27:15.049
I've been waitin' for a girl like you

27:15.216 --> 27:18.802
A love that will survive

27:19.262 --> 27:24.224
I've been waitin' for someone new

27:24.434 --> 27:28.312
To make me feel alive

27:28.521 --> 27:33.567
Yeah, waitin' for a girl like you

27:33.735 --> 27:37.738
To come into my life

27:37.906 --> 27:42.284
- Won't you come into my life?
- Won't you come into my life?

27:59.260 --> 28:05.432
It's like a giant velvet blanket
covered in diamonds.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.935
Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it?

28:08.645 --> 28:12.314
Yeah, it's a little different
than Tulsa, Oklahoma.

28:16.194 --> 28:21.448
So, what did your mom think
about the big move to L.A.?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.118
She thought it was stupid.

28:24.327 --> 28:28.706
My dad just totally didn't get it.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.290
His advice:

28:30.834 --> 28:34.628
"You're gonna fail anyway,
so why not fail closer to home?"

28:36.715 --> 28:39.007
Okay. Total optimist.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.514
What about your folks?
What did they think of the big move?

28:49.477 --> 28:50.811
Not a whole lot really.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.815
I was raised by my grandma.

28:56.609 --> 29:00.404
Yeah, she, by the way,
was all for me getting out of Oklahoma.

29:00.613 --> 29:01.739
Really?

29:02.198 --> 29:05.367
Yeah, she said to me:
"Honey, there ain't nothing for you here...

29:05.535 --> 29:10.664
and the last thing that I want you to do
is wind up stuck here like me."

29:11.416 --> 29:13.500
Man, I adore her.

29:19.674 --> 29:22.843
You're a nice guy, aren't you?

29:25.680 --> 29:27.055
I try to be.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.975
Why?

29:32.228 --> 29:34.313
She wanted to know.

29:38.026 --> 29:41.612
Oh, my God,
I can't believe I'm actually here.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.866
I'm so happy.

30:30.828 --> 30:33.455
You're so good

30:33.998 --> 30:38.502
When we make love
It's understood

30:38.920 --> 30:43.090
It's more than a touch
A word we say

30:43.299 --> 30:47.427
Only in dreams could it be this way

30:48.054 --> 30:51.765
When you love someone, yeah

30:51.933 --> 30:55.811
Really love someone

30:57.772 --> 30:59.982
Now I know it's right

31:00.733 --> 31:05.487
From the moment I wake up
Till deep in the night

31:17.750 --> 31:21.920
There's nowhere on earth
That I'd rather be

31:22.088 --> 31:26.049
Than holding you tenderly

31:26.342 --> 31:30.846
- I've been waitin' for a girl like you
- I've been waitin' for a boy like you

31:31.472 --> 31:35.100
- To come into my life
- To come into my life

31:35.560 --> 31:40.564
- I've been waitin' for a girl like you
- I've been waitin' for a boy like you

31:40.732 --> 31:44.568
- A love that will survive
- A love that will survive

31:44.736 --> 31:46.903
- I've been waitin'
- I've been waitin'

31:47.614 --> 31:49.656
- For someone new
- For someone new

31:49.866 --> 31:53.577
- To make me feel alive
- To make me feel alive

31:53.953 --> 31:58.915
- Yeah, waitin' for a girl like you
- Yeah, waitin' for a boy like you

31:59.083 --> 32:02.753
- To come into my
- To come into my

32:02.920 --> 32:08.258
- Life
- Life

32:23.024 --> 32:24.399
Wait.

32:25.276 --> 32:29.154
- What?
- You're gonna sing me a song.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.073
- Oh, no. Oh, no, no, I can't.
- Ha, ha.

32:31.282 --> 32:32.407
Sherrie.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.785
You are gonna sing
whether you like it or not.

32:34.952 --> 32:36.286
- Now, breathe!
- Hey.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.038
Don't be nervous.

32:42.710 --> 32:43.919
Okay...

32:45.421 --> 32:50.300
This is something I kind of started
working on after we met last night.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.972
Just a small-town girl

32:57.350 --> 33:00.519
Livin' in a lonely world

33:01.646 --> 33:07.818
She took the midnight train goin'
Anywhere

33:09.737 --> 33:12.948
A singer in a smoky room

33:13.825 --> 33:17.077
The smell of wine and cheap perfume

33:17.495 --> 33:20.497
For a smile they can share the night

33:22.166 --> 33:24.584
And it goes on and on and on.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.505
I love it.

33:28.673 --> 33:33.009
It's so beautiful.
I can't believe you wrote that.

33:33.302 --> 33:35.095
How'd it feel?

33:37.724 --> 33:40.016
The breathing really helps.

33:46.524 --> 33:49.568
Just a small town girl

33:50.778 --> 33:53.697
Lonely world

33:55.533 --> 34:00.704
She took the midnight train
Going anywhere

34:01.289 --> 34:04.291
It was actually a bus...

34:04.459 --> 34:06.918
but I think train sounds better.

34:09.045 --> 34:11.422
What sounds better is you singing it.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.301
Really?

34:14.469 --> 34:16.303
You like me singing?

34:18.347 --> 34:21.016
It's one of the most beautiful voices
I've ever heard.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.368
There you go!

34:42.996 --> 34:44.706
- Come on!
- No, no, no.

34:56.427 --> 34:57.844
You have to go back to work.

35:00.097 --> 35:01.807
Oh, like, now. Okay.

35:02.683 --> 35:05.101
Right, right. Yep. You got that?

35:22.578 --> 35:23.787
God hates rock 'n' roll!

35:23.955 --> 35:26.790
- Go back to church!
- Get off the Strip already!

35:27.041 --> 35:29.292
Okay. Okay. Okay.

35:29.502 --> 35:33.046
- Shit. Our opener just dropped out.
- Concrete Ballz?

35:33.214 --> 35:35.131
- In rehab. There are six.
- Both of them?

35:35.466 --> 35:38.635
- Jesus, that band's got a lot of balls.
- Betty Ford has a group rate.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.388
- Think they'll do therapy in pairs?
- Knock it off.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.140
Look, we have to find an opener
in the next two hours.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.185
Don't stress, man.
We'll work this out together.

35:47.353 --> 35:48.687
- What about you?
- Yeah, right.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.313
- Why not?
- Not gonna happen.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.315
- Are you kidding me?
- Sherrie!

35:52.525 --> 35:53.692
What about Drew?

35:53.860 --> 35:55.569
Drool are very expensive.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.654
Not Drool. Drew.

35:58.614 --> 35:59.865
What?

36:00.032 --> 36:02.409
Drew? That Drew? Our Drew?

36:02.577 --> 36:04.828
- He's better than Concrete Ballz.
- Good point.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.873
- Concrete Ballz are very heavy.
- And he'll do it for free.

36:08.165 --> 36:09.416
Baby, baby, baby.

36:09.584 --> 36:12.002
Come on, nobody cares
about the opening act anyway.

36:12.169 --> 36:13.503
- No offense.
- None taken.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.339
Dennis, come on. What do you say?

36:30.021 --> 36:31.104
Okay.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.856
Call your band.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.568
Guys! Guys!
We're opening up for Arsenal.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.366
Doesn't anyone just wanna work
in the bar industry anymore?

36:44.452 --> 36:46.620
- Dennis. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:46.829 --> 36:49.623
- We're gonna blow you away.
- You're gonna blow me, all right.

36:49.790 --> 36:54.085
Three songs. No covers. I need you guys
to be amazing tonight so start drinking...

36:54.253 --> 36:55.420
now.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.508
I love you...

37:01.928 --> 37:05.221
Just go up there and kill it.
You're gonna be amazing. Go!

37:05.389 --> 37:07.265
Go! Go.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.893
Go on!

37:12.730 --> 37:14.397
Well, kiss him goodbye.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.066
What do you mean?

37:16.233 --> 37:18.944
The spotlight doesn't just light them up.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.029
It makes us disappear.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.197
You'll see.

37:34.251 --> 37:37.921
Sayin' "I love you"

37:38.089 --> 37:44.094
Is not the words
I want to hear from you

37:44.595 --> 37:48.390
It's not that I want you

37:48.933 --> 37:54.813
Not to say, but if you only knew

37:55.439 --> 37:58.775
How easy

37:59.276 --> 38:05.448
It would be to show me how you feel

38:05.825 --> 38:08.994
More than words

38:09.161 --> 38:12.205
Is all you'd have to do

38:12.415 --> 38:15.792
To make it real

38:16.168 --> 38:20.964
Then you wouldn't have to say

38:21.424 --> 38:24.676
That you love me

38:25.302 --> 38:31.474
'Cause I'd already know

38:33.477 --> 38:35.478
- Hey, I'm gonna take my break.
- Okay.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.859
Excuse me, sunshine.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.112
Testing. Testing.

38:44.280 --> 38:49.492
I have an adequately sized,
uncircumcised penis.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.537
Penis. Penis.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.040
- And smashing set of balls.
- Okay, I think...

38:55.207 --> 38:59.377
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Say again, whoa!

38:59.545 --> 39:01.671
What are you doing?

39:02.298 --> 39:04.507
The mike's not prepped yet.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.606
Right. Now it's ready.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.816
Thanks.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.109
Cowboys.

39:33.579 --> 39:35.038
Sorry, guys.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.048
Drew...

39:48.219 --> 39:50.053
I can see you're nervous.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.680
Pretend like nobody's watching you.

39:52.848 --> 39:57.644
You know? Connect with something powerful
and emotive deep down.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.980
In my case, that's Little Lonny.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.733
In your case,
it might be something different.

40:03.901 --> 40:08.196
Just imagine yourself completely alone
with something that you love.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.574
Okay.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.884
How I love the way you move

40:30.344 --> 40:33.721
And the sparkle in your eyes

40:34.181 --> 40:37.600
There's a color deep inside them

40:37.810 --> 40:40.728
Like a blue suburban sky

40:40.896 --> 40:46.192
I don't need to be the king of the world

40:47.069 --> 40:49.362
As long as I'm the hero

40:49.530 --> 40:57.530
- Of this little girl
- Yeah

40:57.746 --> 41:02.917
- Heaven isn't too far away
- Heaven isn't too far away

41:03.836 --> 41:09.090
- Closer to it every day
- Closer to it every day

41:09.258 --> 41:12.552
No matter what your friends say

41:12.720 --> 41:18.099
- I know we're gonna find a way
- More than words

41:18.267 --> 41:26.107
- Is all you have to do to make it real
- You have to do to make it real

41:26.275 --> 41:30.612
- Then you wouldn't have to say
- Then you wouldn't have to say

41:30.779 --> 41:35.575
- Heaven isn't too far away
- Heaven isn't too far away

41:36.785 --> 41:39.621
Heaven isn't too far away

41:39.788 --> 41:41.748
More than words

41:41.916 --> 41:45.585
Yeah, heaven isn't too far away

41:45.753 --> 41:52.133
More than words

41:54.136 --> 42:01.142
'Cause I'd already

42:02.102 --> 42:03.645
Know

42:03.812 --> 42:08.942
Sayin' "I love you"

42:14.531 --> 42:16.282
You beautiful bastard.

42:47.982 --> 42:49.357
Stacee!

42:49.525 --> 42:50.692
Stacee!

42:53.862 --> 42:55.071
Everybody, listen up!

42:55.656 --> 43:00.410
This place is about to become a sea
of sweat, ear-shattering music and puke.

43:00.577 --> 43:01.703
So let's get moving.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.249
Paul! Ha-ha.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.335
You're early.

43:09.503 --> 43:13.923
Actually, I told him the gig was last night, so
technically he's a day late. Don't tell him.

43:15.509 --> 43:16.551
Work, work, work.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.678
Yes, you're on the air.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.781
Hey, Stacee, you made it.

43:38.991 --> 43:40.033
Hey Man.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.201
Yeah. Hey, man.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.538
No, this...

43:46.290 --> 43:47.582
is Hey Man.

43:50.419 --> 43:51.627
Right.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.630
Hey Man.

43:57.509 --> 44:00.219
Thank you so much for doing this...

44:00.387 --> 44:01.721
You and me.

44:05.517 --> 44:06.726
You and me.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.397
We're sole survivors.

44:13.817 --> 44:18.279
Even the cockroaches got burned
by the fallout, but not us.

44:21.909 --> 44:23.743
It's great to see your face-bone again.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.087
- Now let's burn this place to the ground.
- Yes.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.589
Right on, brother. Rock 'n' roll.

44:37.633 --> 44:42.178
No. When I'm done, we literally need
to burn this place to the ground.

44:43.472 --> 44:46.641
Otherwise the fire phoenix gets trapped.

44:49.978 --> 44:52.271
Yes, I suppose so.

44:55.943 --> 44:58.403
Ha-ha. It's a joke. I'm kidding, man.

45:01.949 --> 45:05.868
I mean, of course, you're not really gonna
burn the place down to the ground, right?

45:06.954 --> 45:07.954
No.

45:09.123 --> 45:11.791
You can't trap a fire phoenix.

45:15.003 --> 45:16.629
I mean, that'd be crazy, right?

45:19.216 --> 45:20.800
It would be. Yeah.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.010
I mean, seriously...

45:23.178 --> 45:27.473
tonight, I am gonna light
this place on fire...

45:27.641 --> 45:28.975
for you...

45:30.185 --> 45:32.145
my rock 'n' roll brother.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.535
Sherrie!

45:51.457 --> 45:54.333
Sherrie. Sherrie.

45:58.338 --> 46:00.173
You okay?

46:01.717 --> 46:03.718
- What happened?
- You passed out.

46:05.095 --> 46:09.765
I saw Stacee Jaxx. Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed. Oh, my Go...

46:09.933 --> 46:13.561
It's okay. I'm sure girls
faint around him all the time.

46:17.232 --> 46:19.358
They're gonna be fainting
around you too in no time.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.173
Here we go.

46:42.674 --> 46:47.345
Hey, Stacee. I got someone
I'd like you to meet, man.

46:47.554 --> 46:50.681
This is Constance Sack. Rolling Stone.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.185
Stace?

46:55.521 --> 46:57.813
You in there, man?

46:58.023 --> 47:00.399
Say, superstar, rise and shine.

47:00.943 --> 47:03.277
Constance Sack. Rolling Stone.

47:03.445 --> 47:04.946
Stones.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.365
- Good.
- The Rolling Stones?

47:17.084 --> 47:18.376
Where's Mick?

47:21.588 --> 47:23.548
No. The magazine.

47:24.174 --> 47:25.800
She's a reporter.

47:25.968 --> 47:30.721
She's here to do the big story about
you going solo, brother.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.432
- Paul, I...
- Okay.

47:34.434 --> 47:36.561
- Look, Paul, I...
- Hey, hey.

47:37.396 --> 47:38.896
Be yourself.

47:39.273 --> 47:41.774
Superstar, right? Okay, you know what?

47:42.109 --> 47:45.861
I'm gonna leave you two alone,
go return some phone calls.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.655
Play nice!

47:47.823 --> 47:49.573
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

47:51.243 --> 47:53.703
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I love you, Stacee Jaxx!

48:14.975 --> 48:17.226
No! I love you! I love you!

48:26.236 --> 48:27.945
Okay.

48:28.113 --> 48:29.947
Five minutes.

48:30.490 --> 48:32.783
Oh, God. Okay.

48:34.411 --> 48:37.955
Five minutes and go.

48:38.123 --> 48:40.082
Okay. Stacee Jaxx,
back at The Bourbon...

48:40.250 --> 48:41.917
No, no, no. No.

48:42.544 --> 48:43.586
Now go.

48:45.339 --> 48:48.674
At The Bourbon, where it all started.

48:48.842 --> 48:53.471
Your first album Stick Meat gave birth
to some of rock's greatest anthems.

48:53.638 --> 48:55.931
And now a solo career. Why now?

48:56.266 --> 48:57.433
Well...

48:58.352 --> 48:59.477
I think...

49:01.980 --> 49:05.983
I think due to the changing nature
of the music industry...

49:06.151 --> 49:09.445
the change in cultural trends...

49:09.613 --> 49:13.157
and when you think of
blah-blah-blah and blah-blah-blah.

49:13.617 --> 49:19.163
You make sure that you wanna take in...

49:20.457 --> 49:21.624
- Okay.
- Four minutes.

49:24.336 --> 49:28.047
You know, some people have said that
you've become quite difficult to work with.

49:28.256 --> 49:32.176
That you're constantly late, you're
reclusive, sometimes even nonsensical.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.595
I wanna ask you this:

49:35.263 --> 49:40.101
Have these people even met themselves?

49:43.146 --> 49:45.856
Well, I'm talking about your band.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.488
Let me tell you something.

49:53.281 --> 49:55.950
I know me better than anyone...

49:56.785 --> 49:59.036
because I live in here.

50:02.165 --> 50:04.500
- Eight minutes.
- You just said four.

50:06.336 --> 50:08.504
- Three.
- But it...

50:13.176 --> 50:14.927
Do you think that it's possible...

50:15.095 --> 50:17.721
that you've shut out or alienated
so many people...

50:17.889 --> 50:20.433
that you had no other option
but to go solo?

50:29.192 --> 50:31.735
You gotta be true to the muse. Hey Man.

50:32.529 --> 50:34.321
Scotch me, little buddy.

50:43.373 --> 50:45.875
And who is your muse?

50:49.045 --> 50:50.129
Right.

50:54.759 --> 50:56.218
Fine.

50:56.386 --> 50:58.888
- Born Steven Jackson in Detroit, Michigan.
- Are we out?

50:59.097 --> 51:01.891
Raised by a single mom, Doris,
now deceased.

51:02.058 --> 51:04.727
Dropped out of Woodrow Wilson High
in 11th grade.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.937
Your first concert was Aerosmith.

51:07.105 --> 51:11.775
When you were 17, you hitchhiked to L.A.
with your high school sweetheart.

51:14.529 --> 51:15.738
Remember her?

51:21.244 --> 51:22.870
No comment?

51:28.543 --> 51:30.127
Two minutes.

51:30.754 --> 51:32.546
Did I hit a nerve?

51:35.175 --> 51:37.801
Aerosmith? Detroit?

51:38.386 --> 51:40.262
High school sweetheart?

51:43.225 --> 51:46.268
Jenny Anderson. Your first love.

51:47.062 --> 51:52.733
And your last hit single, "I'm gonna rock you
in your mouth," it was written about her.

51:56.613 --> 51:59.490
Record sold 100 million copies.

52:01.326 --> 52:05.287
And that record
was produced about eight years ago.

52:05.455 --> 52:07.206
Some people say
you've sold out since then.

52:10.043 --> 52:15.214
I sell out all right.
Every seat, every stadium I ever play.

52:17.133 --> 52:19.885
Yeah, and yet, creatively,
you've come to a standstill.

52:20.554 --> 52:23.472
You've been in and out of the studio
for the past, what? Two years?

52:23.640 --> 52:26.058
And no results. Nothing.

52:45.287 --> 52:46.287
Time.

52:48.915 --> 52:50.583
You know, you're not so weird.

52:50.750 --> 52:53.085
You're just another lonely man
with many regrets.

52:54.546 --> 52:57.047
I said time. You can go now.

52:59.384 --> 53:00.718
Final question.

53:01.595 --> 53:05.389
What happens when you realize
you can't get rid of Stacee Jaxx?

53:11.062 --> 53:14.231
You have no idea what it's like to be me.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.568
Well, then here's your chance.

53:18.612 --> 53:22.072
What's it like to be the Stacee Jaxx?

53:38.214 --> 53:40.090
It's all the same

53:41.426 --> 53:44.219
Only the names will change

53:44.638 --> 53:50.267
Every day it seems we're wastin' away

53:50.935 --> 53:52.519
Another place

53:53.938 --> 53:56.732
Where the faces are so cold

53:57.317 --> 54:03.280
I drive all night just to get back home

54:03.490 --> 54:05.991
I'm a cowboy

54:06.785 --> 54:09.495
On a steel horse I ride

54:09.996 --> 54:11.789
I'm wanted

54:13.541 --> 54:16.627
Dead or alive

54:16.795 --> 54:17.961
Wanted

54:19.881 --> 54:22.966
Dead or alive

54:29.641 --> 54:31.058
Sometimes I sleep

54:32.477 --> 54:35.562
Sometimes it's not for days

54:35.772 --> 54:37.398
The people I meet

54:38.692 --> 54:41.360
Always go their separate ways

54:42.028 --> 54:44.655
Sometimes you tell the day

54:45.031 --> 54:47.658
By the bottle that you drink

54:48.410 --> 54:51.161
And times when you're alone

54:51.830 --> 54:53.706
All you do is think

54:53.873 --> 54:54.915
Dalai Lama.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.208
I'm a cowboy

54:57.669 --> 55:00.671
On a steel horse I ride

55:00.922 --> 55:02.339
I'm wanted

55:02.507 --> 55:03.882
Wanted

55:04.509 --> 55:07.010
Dead or alive

55:07.679 --> 55:08.846
Wanted

55:09.013 --> 55:10.723
Wanted

55:10.890 --> 55:12.890
Dead or alive

55:20.400 --> 55:24.737
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

55:24.904 --> 55:28.031
Oh, and I ride

55:28.199 --> 55:31.326
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

55:37.542 --> 55:41.336
Oh, when I walk these streets

55:42.130 --> 55:45.048
A loaded six string on my back

55:45.592 --> 55:47.384
I play for keeps

55:48.470 --> 55:51.221
'Cause I might not make it back

55:51.556 --> 55:54.767
I've been everywhere

55:54.934 --> 55:57.644
Still standing tall

55:58.062 --> 56:00.564
I've seen a million faces

56:00.899 --> 56:03.859
And I've rocked them all

56:04.110 --> 56:05.903
I'm a cowboy

56:07.405 --> 56:10.240
On a steel horse I ride

56:10.450 --> 56:12.242
I'm wanted

56:12.410 --> 56:13.911
Wanted

56:14.078 --> 56:18.123
Dead or alive

56:18.291 --> 56:19.958
Well, I'm a cowboy

56:21.252 --> 56:24.254
I got the night on my side

56:24.589 --> 56:26.089
I'm wanted

56:26.257 --> 56:28.175
Wanted

56:28.384 --> 56:30.177
Dead or alive

56:30.386 --> 56:34.139
And I ride

56:34.307 --> 56:36.517
Dead or alive

56:36.684 --> 56:40.312
I still drive

56:40.647 --> 56:48.647
- Dead or alive
- Dead or alive

57:08.174 --> 57:09.633
I'm Stacee.

57:11.469 --> 57:14.638
Sherrie.

57:17.350 --> 57:19.142
When my hamster died...

57:19.811 --> 57:22.145
your music really helped me through.

57:34.242 --> 57:35.826
You have such a perky...

57:39.038 --> 57:40.581
heart.

57:42.041 --> 57:43.667
Thank you.

58:00.518 --> 58:02.227
Do me a favor.

58:03.021 --> 58:04.104
Sure.

58:04.272 --> 58:07.691
There's a cut-glass bottle of Scotch
in the limo.

58:09.402 --> 58:11.695
Bring it to my dressing room?

58:18.536 --> 58:19.953
Right away.

58:21.122 --> 58:22.581
Sherrie.

58:24.792 --> 58:27.920
- Where were you?
- I just met Stacee again.

58:28.087 --> 58:29.212
And I didn't even faint.

58:29.756 --> 58:32.174
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

58:32.342 --> 58:34.176
I gotta go grab something for Stacee.

58:34.344 --> 58:37.471
Wait. I want you to be here when I go on.

58:37.639 --> 58:38.972
Oh, yeah, of course.

58:41.768 --> 58:45.270
Now, Patricia, this is the third night
in a row that you've been here.

58:45.438 --> 58:49.942
- Why so passionate?
- Well, Mitch, this has to end.

58:50.109 --> 58:54.154
We're calling on anyone with children
to join forces with us...

58:54.322 --> 58:56.782
and show up here every night...

58:56.950 --> 59:00.535
until the doors of these places
are closed for good.

59:00.703 --> 59:03.664
Stacee Jaxx can wreck his own life.

59:03.831 --> 59:07.125
But when it comes to raping...

59:07.293 --> 59:11.838
the ears of our children
with this poison...

59:12.006 --> 59:14.132
- We have to fight!
- Well, they...

59:14.300 --> 59:16.510
Rock 'n' roll is the only freedom
we have.

59:16.678 --> 59:18.178
Stacee Jaxx is God!

59:18.346 --> 59:22.307
Rock 'n' roll forever! Waah!

59:23.226 --> 59:26.603
Sniff the mike.

59:26.813 --> 59:29.815
I'm walking here!

59:29.983 --> 59:32.609
Okay, great interview.
I hope you got everything.

59:32.777 --> 59:35.320
- You're not a cowboy.
- Why don't you tell me what I am?

59:35.488 --> 59:38.740
- You're a man-child stuck in a rut.
- I love it when you talk dirty.

59:38.908 --> 59:42.160
You used to be great. But whatever
made you that way, it's gone.

59:42.328 --> 59:43.996
That's right. Give it to me rough.

59:44.205 --> 59:46.206
You're another rocker
asleep at the wheel...

59:46.374 --> 59:49.668
- singing songs you wrote 10 years ago.
- Okay, lady.

59:49.836 --> 59:52.838
As long as you've got this manager
keeping you on the road...

59:53.006 --> 59:56.675
and doping you up with girls and booze
and million-dollar record deals...

59:56.843 --> 59:59.761
he's gonna keep you asleep
and drive your career off a cliff.

59:59.929 --> 01:00:02.514
- Line crossed. Let's go, sweetheart.
- Don't touch me.

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:05.434
You used to write great songs.
Where are they now?

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:09.354
You know what? I'm calling your editor.
Close friend of mine, by the way.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:11.690
- Rolling Stone magazine.
- Jann Wenner's office.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:12.983
Get out.

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:15.986
My words exactly.
This interview is over.

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.696
No, no, no. Not her.

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:20.866
You.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.038
All of you.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:30.292
Copy that. Everybody out.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.012
No, no, no.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.889
Not you too, Hey Man.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.558
We'll do the next one together, all right?

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.477
All right?

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.980
Come on, don't be like that.
We'll do the next one together.

01:00:52.398 --> 01:00:54.066
I promise. Okay?

01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:14.920
You know, I think you get
this sense of entitlement...

01:01:15.087 --> 01:01:17.881
due to the fact that you're a rock god.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.258
But it's not real.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:23.512
It's not love.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.263
No.

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.433
It's not love.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:31.520
Then what is it?

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.815
Off the record?

01:01:37.902 --> 01:01:39.820
Sex.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:47.077
And other people's projections
of what they want me to be.

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:51.706
Of what you and all your readers
want me to be.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:53.959
Sex.

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:01.091
And it keeps me from going out...

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:04.928
and getting the one thing
that could save me.

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:15.355
But I can't have that now.

01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:20.443
I'm a slave to rock 'n' roll.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.492
I am searching for the perfect song...

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:32.497
the perfect sound that will
make you wanna live forever.

01:02:32.665 --> 01:02:34.749
Like I said:

01:02:35.626 --> 01:02:38.837
I know me better than anyone
because I live in here.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.423
And no one else can.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.191
I can.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.860
I gotta take a little time

01:03:03.487 --> 01:03:07.282
A little time to think things over

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:15.290
I better read between the lines

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:20.629
In case I need it when I'm older

01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:33.516
In my life

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.978
There's been heartache and pain

01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:39.648
I don't know

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:43.234
If I can face it again

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:48.907
Can't stop now
I've traveled so far

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:55.872
To change this lonely life

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.751
- I wanna know what love is
- I wanna know what love is

01:04:02.254 --> 01:04:05.882
- I want you to show me
- I want you to show me

01:04:07.885 --> 01:04:11.262
- I wanna feel what love is
- I wanna feel what love is

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:19.521
- I know you can show me
- I know you can show me

01:04:28.447 --> 01:04:31.366
I'm gonna take a little time

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:37.038
A little time to look around me

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:41.418
I've got nowhere left to hide

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:47.048
It looks like love has finally found me

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:50.969
In my life

01:04:51.595 --> 01:04:54.639
There's been heartache and pain

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.142
I don't know

01:04:57.309 --> 01:05:00.770
If I can face it again

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.148
I can't stop now

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:06.484
Hey, man, have you seen Sherrie? Blon...?

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:09.654
Drew? Hey, Drew, showtime.

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:11.614
Come on. Stop fannying around.

01:05:11.782 --> 01:05:13.658
Let's talk about love

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:16.494
I wanna know what love is

01:05:16.662 --> 01:05:19.789
Love that you feel inside

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:22.751
I want you to show me

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:25.336
I'm feelin' so much love

01:05:25.546 --> 01:05:28.173
I wanna feel what love is

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.424
No

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.676
You just cannot hide

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:35.847
I know you can show me

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:40.018
Yeah

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:43.605
I wanna know what love is

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.316
Let's talk about love

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:49.986
I want you to show me

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:51.821
I wanna feel it too

01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:55.617
- I wanna feel what love is
- I wanna feel it too

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.786
And I know, and I know

01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:00.622
- I want you to show me
- And I know, and I know

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:05.210
And I know

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.801
Oh, yeah.

01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:23.478
Okay.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.612
That...

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.114
That...

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:36.741
That...

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:39.744
can be on the record.

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:46.376
Oh, my God.

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:49.420
This was a mistake.

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:50.713
Wait.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.258
Hey, wait.

01:06:53.425 --> 01:06:56.052
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

01:06:57.429 --> 01:06:59.097
Can't wait to see the article.

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:14.529
Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.447
- I didn't mean to do that.
- It's okay.

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:17.699
Just leave it.

01:07:22.621 --> 01:07:23.955
Please.

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:29.377
Quieten down, please, you hot fecund
soup of estrogen and testosterone.

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:32.297
I need you to manage
your expectations...

01:07:32.464 --> 01:07:36.968
and please welcome to the stage for
their debut here at The Bourbon Rooms...

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:38.553
the brilliant...

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:40.430
Bring on the rock!

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.807
Drew.
What's the name of your band, mate?

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:45.393
Wolfgang Von Colt.

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:47.979
Come on, Arsenal, let's go!

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:51.482
- And you're sticking with that, are you?
- Yeah.

01:07:51.817 --> 01:07:53.484
Come on!

01:07:53.777 --> 01:07:56.654
Please welcome to the stage
the very poorly titled...

01:07:56.822 --> 01:07:58.948
Wolfgang Van Colt!

01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:01.284
- Von Colt!
- It's not an improvement.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:03.912
Wolfgang Von Colt.

01:08:05.122 --> 01:08:07.081
I can't believe that just happened.

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:08.499
Thank you. Thanks.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.628
No, no, no. Thank you.

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:16.131
Come on!

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.772
Drew.

01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:33.107
Drew.

01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:36.319
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:38.988
please resurrect your enthusiasm...

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:41.198
one final time for...

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:44.368
Wolfgang Von Colt!

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:47.162
Drew! Oi, Drew!

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:50.541
We want Arsenal!

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.395
I wanna rock!

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:23.533
I said:

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.742
I wanna rock

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:25.993
Rock

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.413
I wanna rock

01:09:29.581 --> 01:09:30.665
Rock

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:35.295
- I want to rock
- Rock

01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:39.716
Turn it down, you say

01:09:39.883 --> 01:09:41.968
All I gotta say to you
Is time and time again

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:46.346
I say no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:48.433
Tell me not to play

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.935
All I gotta say to you
When you tell me not to play

01:09:51.103 --> 01:09:54.605
I say no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:59.444
So if you ask me why
I like the way I play it

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.281
There's only one thing I can say to you

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.616
- I wanna rock
- Rock

01:10:05.826 --> 01:10:07.785
Go, Drew! You rock!

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:09.912
- I wanna rock
- Rock!

01:10:11.623 --> 01:10:14.584
- I wanna rock
- Rock!

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:16.461
Oh, yeah

01:10:16.628 --> 01:10:18.838
- I wanna rock
- Rock!

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:23.426
I want to rock

01:10:31.643 --> 01:10:33.644
Yeah!

01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:35.813
Spring break!

01:10:38.442 --> 01:10:39.734
I wanna rock

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:41.861
- Rock, rock
- Rock, rock

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:44.238
I wanna rock

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:46.491
- Rock, rock
- Rock, rock

01:10:46.867 --> 01:10:48.867
I want to rock

01:11:09.723 --> 01:11:11.724
Drew! Drew! Drew!

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.143
Go, Drew!

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:29.617
Drew, baby, that was unbelievable!
You were amazing, they totally loved you.

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:32.537
The crowd was totally on their feet.
They loved it.

01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:37.041
Drew?

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.424
Drew.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:46.551
Can I help you?

01:11:48.345 --> 01:11:49.679
What's wrong?

01:11:51.056 --> 01:11:52.723
Why are you mad at me?

01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:55.726
I'm not mad.

01:11:55.936 --> 01:11:58.521
I'm celebrating a great gig.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:01.524
Okay. Well, can you at least look at me?

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:02.984
Why should I?

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:06.487
I don't need you.

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:10.032
There are hundreds of "yous"
out there. And tonight?

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.537
They were all looking at me.

01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:23.921
The spotlight.

01:12:24.256 --> 01:12:25.756
She was right.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.761
Tell Dennis I quit.

01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:35.892
Sherrie!

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.269
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:39.770
Hey. Paul Gill.

01:12:40.105 --> 01:12:42.231
I'm Stacee Jaxx's manager.

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:47.069
- You were fantastic tonight, man.
- Thank you, man. Thank you.

01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:49.989
Let her go.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.408
Let me ask you something:

01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:55.703
What do Keith Richards, Jimmy Page...

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:58.372
and Stacee Jaxx all have in common?

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:03.252
Broken hearts
and very, very long careers.

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:07.965
Now, you want love? Go after her.

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:10.134
You might even find it.

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:14.138
But I can guarantee you something
much more rare...

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.140
and a lot more fun, man.

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:18.434
Stacee Jaxx and Arsenal!

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:19.936
What is that?

01:13:23.148 --> 01:13:24.524
Fame.

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:25.900
Love is like a bomb

01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:34.450
Bomb

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:37.328
Love is like a bomb

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:52.134
Hey!

01:13:52.302 --> 01:13:54.971
Hey-hey!

01:13:55.138 --> 01:13:59.809
Hey!

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:04.313
Hey!

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.775
Love is like a bomb, baby
Come and get it on

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:10.278
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:13.030
Lookin' like a tramp
Like a video vamp

01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:15.616
Demolition woman
Can I be your man?

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:17.201
Be your man

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:24.041
Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n'
a flash a little light

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:26.377
Television lover, baby, go all night

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:29.380
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.716
Little Miss Innocent, sugar me

01:14:31.883 --> 01:14:33.509
Yeah

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:35.886
Yeah

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:37.847
C'mon

01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:40.349
Take a bottle

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:42.393
Shake it up

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:46.063
Break the bubble

01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:47.982
Break it up

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.152
Pour some sugar on me

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.904
In the name of love

01:14:54.114 --> 01:14:57.074
Pour some sugar on me

01:14:57.242 --> 01:14:59.076
C'mon, fire me up

01:14:59.244 --> 01:15:02.163
Pour your sugar on me

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.332
I can't get enough

01:15:04.499 --> 01:15:07.043
I'm hot, sticky sweet

01:15:08.128 --> 01:15:09.170
Sherrie quit.

01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:12.256
And I quit too!

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.550
Okay.

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:20.431
Why is everybody quitting today?

01:15:21.391 --> 01:15:24.435
Who cares?
This is the greatest night of my life!

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:28.356
You got the peaches
I got the cream

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:30.775
Sweet to taste
Saccharine

01:15:30.942 --> 01:15:33.444
'Cause I'm hot, say what
Sticky sweet

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:36.947
From my head
My head to my feet

01:15:37.949 --> 01:15:40.117
Do you take sugar

01:15:40.577 --> 01:15:42.453
One lump or two

01:15:42.746 --> 01:15:45.373
Take a bottle
Take a bottle

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.084
Shake it up
Shake it up

01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:50.920
- Break the bubble
- Break it up

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:52.713
Break it up

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.633
Pour some sugar on me

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.593
In the name of love

01:15:57.761 --> 01:15:59.095
Hey, man.

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.889
Did you give my offer some thought?

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.724
C'mon, fire me up

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.394
Pour your sugar on me

01:16:08.146 --> 01:16:09.313
We got a deal.

01:16:09.481 --> 01:16:11.899
Pour some sugar on me

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:14.819
Ha-ha. That's my man!

01:16:14.986 --> 01:16:17.822
Pour some sugar on me

01:16:17.989 --> 01:16:19.907
Get it
Come get it

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:23.077
Pour your sugar on me

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.499
Pour some sugar on me

01:16:30.001 --> 01:16:31.210
Sugar me

01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:54.650
Thirty-one thousand,
two hundred and three dollars.

01:16:54.818 --> 01:16:56.318
Crisis averted.

01:16:56.486 --> 01:16:58.154
Thank you, Stacee Jaxx.

01:16:58.321 --> 01:17:01.031
And Stacee Jaxx thanks you.

01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:03.534
- Well, hello, Paul.
- Well, hello, Dennis. Lonny.

01:17:03.827 --> 01:17:05.536
Now, hold on just a second.

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:08.497
We got 90 percent of the house,
20 percent of the bar...

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.041
100 percent of the merch.

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:14.003
That means that Stacee's take
works out to about...

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:16.380
Wait, wait, wait. "Stacee's take"?

01:17:16.548 --> 01:17:19.925
Hold on. Add a zero. Add three.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:26.891
Thirty-one thousand,
two hundred and nine. Correct?

01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:28.517
- Yeah.
- Crap.

01:17:28.685 --> 01:17:30.019
Crap. We got a problem.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.688
- What problem?
- Well, you owe me six bucks.

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:36.734
But screw it. Keep it.
I get fussy about singles anyway.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:39.195
Paul, you told me this was a freebie.

01:17:39.362 --> 01:17:43.866
Stacee Jaxx does not take a dump for free.
He took a huge pay cut on this.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.743
You are cutting my throat here!

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:49.288
Don't be so pessimistic.
Stacee just put you guys back on the map!

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:52.041
No, no. I put him on the map.

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:56.253
I beg your pardon.

01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:58.255
I gave him his first gig.

01:17:58.423 --> 01:18:01.008
And I gave him his first million.

01:18:03.094 --> 01:18:06.847
Anyway.
Awesome doing business with you, ciao!

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:11.644
Didn't know Paul spoke Italian.

01:18:22.614 --> 01:18:25.825
Cryin' on the corner
Waitin' in the rain

01:18:25.992 --> 01:18:30.287
I swear I'll never, ever wait again

01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:31.956
You gave me your word

01:18:32.123 --> 01:18:36.210
But words for you are lies

01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:40.965
Darlin', in my wildest dreams

01:18:41.132 --> 01:18:46.303
I never thought I'd go

01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:51.475
But it's time to let you know

01:18:52.143 --> 01:18:55.312
I'm gonna harden my heart

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:59.275
I'm gonna swallow my tears

01:18:59.442 --> 01:19:05.531
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

01:19:07.659 --> 01:19:10.619
All of my life I've been
waitin' in the rain

01:19:10.787 --> 01:19:14.665
I've been waiting for a feeling
That never, ever came

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:16.625
It feels so close

01:19:16.793 --> 01:19:18.752
But always disappears

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.588
Watch it.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:44.570
Darlin', in your wildest dreams

01:19:45.071 --> 01:19:50.576
You never had a clue

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:59.453
But it's time you got the news

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:04.214
I'm gonna harden my heart

01:20:04.382 --> 01:20:06.550
Harden your heart

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:08.886
I'm gonna swallow my tears

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:12.723
Swallow your tears, girl

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:14.516
- I'm gonna turn
- Turn

01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:21.690
- And leave you here
- Leave you here

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:41.710
Oh, like a candle

01:20:41.878 --> 01:20:43.587
Cognac, brandy.

01:20:43.755 --> 01:20:46.006
- Oh, no, I don't mix my drinks.
- No, no, no.

01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:48.634
This is Cognac.

01:20:49.052 --> 01:20:51.470
- She's getting you a brandy.
- Here you go, Justice.

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:54.264
- Thank you.
- Now you drink up and dry off.

01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:55.724
But remember:

01:20:55.892 --> 01:20:58.102
This is just a rest stop.

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.396
I need a job.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.274
Do you dance?

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:07.444
You got the best of me

01:21:07.612 --> 01:21:08.904
I'm a better singer.

01:21:09.155 --> 01:21:10.447
I don't need a singer.

01:21:10.615 --> 01:21:14.326
And you're a pretty girl. You wanna
make some real money, you gotta dance.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:18.038
You also have to be tough too.
And you don't look too tough to me.

01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:20.916
I'm tough.

01:21:21.084 --> 01:21:23.127
It's not right for everyone, honey.

01:21:23.294 --> 01:21:25.045
Hey there.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.964
I can wait tables. I'm good.

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:28.173
Are you sure?

01:21:28.341 --> 01:21:34.096
You're bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see

01:21:34.305 --> 01:21:36.682
Okay. You start tomorrow.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:43.022
You said, "Oh, girl
It's a cold world"

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:46.775
When you keep it all to yourself"

01:21:47.944 --> 01:21:52.823
I said, "You can't hide
On the inside"

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:57.077
All the pain you've ever felt"

01:21:57.495 --> 01:22:02.332
You better ransom your heart
And, baby, don't look back

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.878
'Cause we got nobody else

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:09.339
We're running with the shadows
Of the night

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:13.385
So, baby, take my hand
It'll be all right

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:16.847
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:20.350
They'll come true in the end

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.328
I'm gonna harden my heart

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:43.499
- Harden your heart, girl
- I'm gonna swallow my tears

01:22:43.666 --> 01:22:44.875
Swallow your tears

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:49.171
I'm gonna turn and leave you

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:52.841
Darlin', in my wildest dreams

01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:58.055
I never thought I'd go

01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:02.226
But it's time to let you know

01:23:02.685 --> 01:23:07.397
Oh, I'm gonna harden my heart

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:11.443
I'm gonna swallow my tears

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:19.653
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:27.751
Whitty.

01:23:27.919 --> 01:23:31.255
What if I told you The Bourbon Room
hadn't paid taxes in over a year?

01:23:31.422 --> 01:23:33.715
- Why do you ask?
- Because it's true.

01:23:33.883 --> 01:23:37.636
They're broke. I am so excited.

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:39.221
I'm gonna call the press.

01:23:42.934 --> 01:23:44.101
Patty-cakes?

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:46.937
I think this whole
"Cleaning up the Strip" thing...

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:49.731
is gonna be great for the city
and for us.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:55.696
But you seem to have this issue
with Stacee Jaxx.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:59.199
I mean, it seems to be really intense.

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:01.285
Well...

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.454
The short answer?

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:10.711
When I was a naive undergrad at UCLA,
I had a roommate.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:14.381
- Let's just call her Vivian.
- Oh.

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:19.720
One night she was partying innocently
at The Bourbon Room...

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:22.931
when that two-headed monster
spotted her...

01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:26.852
and lured her into his suite
at the Park Hyatt.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.479
- What?
- For the first time...

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:31.982
she felt like a woman.

01:24:32.525 --> 01:24:37.654
Sure, a handcuffed woman covered in
Cool Whip and Wild Turkey, but still...

01:24:38.781 --> 01:24:40.324
a woman.

01:24:40.491 --> 01:24:42.492
Yeah. A woman.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:46.121
- Well, you can guess what happened next.
- Oh.

01:24:46.289 --> 01:24:50.459
His tour bus left L.A.,
taking Stacee Jaxx with it.

01:24:51.002 --> 01:24:53.670
And I swore in her honor...

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:55.964
that I would see him...

01:24:56.507 --> 01:25:00.177
and his sick satanic legacy gone
for good.

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.474
That's the short answer?

01:25:06.392 --> 01:25:07.643
Yeah.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:19.321
I don't know where I'm going

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:25.285
But I sure know where I've been

01:25:26.412 --> 01:25:31.333
Hanging on the promises
In the songs of yesterday

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:35.545
And I've made up my mind

01:25:37.215 --> 01:25:40.217
I ain't wasting no more time

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:43.720
But here I go again

01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:49.601
Here I go again

01:25:53.731 --> 01:25:57.067
Though I keep searching for an answer

01:25:58.611 --> 01:26:02.572
I never seem to find what I'm looking for

01:26:03.908 --> 01:26:08.745
Oh, Lord, I pray
You give me strength to carry on

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:14.251
'Cause I know what it means

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:18.588
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:23.427
And here I go again on my own

01:26:24.595 --> 01:26:28.557
Going down the only road I've ever known

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:34.104
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:39.443
And I've made up my mind

01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:44.281
I ain't wasting no more time

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:49.745
I'm just another heart in need of rescue

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:55.250
Waitin' on love's sweet charity

01:26:56.794 --> 01:27:01.173
And I'm gonna hold on
For the rest of my days

01:27:02.258 --> 01:27:05.635
'Cause I know what it means

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:10.515
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

01:27:11.642 --> 01:27:15.395
And here I go again on my own

01:27:16.689 --> 01:27:19.900
Going down the only road I've ever known

01:27:21.944 --> 01:27:25.447
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:31.495
And I've made up my mind

01:27:33.956 --> 01:27:36.333
I ain't wasting no more time

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:39.169
But here I go again

01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:41.380
Oh, here I go

01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:43.465
Here I go again

01:27:43.716 --> 01:27:46.676
Here I go

01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:49.179
Here I go again

01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:52.182
Here I go
Here I go

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:56.311
Here I go

01:27:56.479 --> 01:28:01.691
Here I go

01:28:26.008 --> 01:28:29.177
Hey. Come on, big fella.
We can sort this out.

01:28:29.512 --> 01:28:32.055
What part of "We're screwed"
don't you understand?

01:28:32.223 --> 01:28:35.392
What part of "Rock 'n' roll is forever"
don't you understand?

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.519
This monument to decadence...

01:28:37.687 --> 01:28:41.189
can't be brought down by a few
plastic bureaucrats in bowler hats.

01:28:41.357 --> 01:28:42.732
It's eternal.

01:28:44.068 --> 01:28:46.403
I just feel like I've let everyone down.

01:28:56.747 --> 01:28:58.248
Not everyone.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.920
What do you mean?

01:29:11.262 --> 01:29:15.515
I can't fight this feeling any longer

01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:21.771
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow

01:29:22.773 --> 01:29:28.111
What started out as friendship
Has grown stronger

01:29:28.779 --> 01:29:33.283
I only wish I had the strength
To let it show

01:29:35.119 --> 01:29:38.914
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever

01:29:39.081 --> 01:29:40.957
You're not fucking with me, are you?

01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:44.920
I said there is no reason for my fear

01:29:45.087 --> 01:29:46.671
This is a dream come true.

01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:52.177
'Cause I feel so secure
When we're together

01:29:53.137 --> 01:29:55.305
You give my life direction

01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:00.352
You make everything so clear

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.480
And even as I wander

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.941
I'm keeping you in sight

01:30:06.317 --> 01:30:09.027
You're a candle in the window

01:30:09.195 --> 01:30:12.155
On a cold, dark winter's night

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:14.824
- And I'm getting closer
- And I'm getting closer

01:30:14.992 --> 01:30:22.332
- Than I ever thought I might
- Than I ever thought I might

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:28.672
- And I can't fight this feeling anymore
- And I can't fight this feeling anymore

01:30:28.839 --> 01:30:34.844
- I've forgotten what I started fighting for
- I've forgotten what I started fighting for

01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:38.932
It's time to bring this ship into the shore

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:44.980
And throw away the oars forever

01:30:47.024 --> 01:30:52.487
- 'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
- 'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore

01:30:52.863 --> 01:30:58.410
- I've forgotten what I started fighting for
- I've forgotten what I started fighting for

01:30:59.036 --> 01:31:02.706
- And if I have to crawl upon the floor
- And if I have to crawl upon the floor

01:31:03.374 --> 01:31:05.834
Come crashing through your door

01:31:06.377 --> 01:31:13.008
- Baby, I can't fight this feelin' anymore
- Baby, I can't fight this feelin' anymore

01:31:18.514 --> 01:31:19.764
Hey, boss.

01:31:21.183 --> 01:31:22.225
What is it, Chico?

01:31:22.393 --> 01:31:23.810
The beer guy is here.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.228
Tell him I'm busy.

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:29.691
Busy falling in love.

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.698
Let's go, Donny, Hey, you okay?

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:40.410
Oh, that? Don't sweat him.
That's just my ex, Donny.

01:31:40.703 --> 01:31:42.787
Anyway, how you holding up, baby?

01:31:42.955 --> 01:31:45.957
I'd say men are pigs but that'd be
totally unfair to pigs, so...

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.793
I gave up a long time ago
trying make men respectable.

01:31:48.961 --> 01:31:52.088
There's only one place
you're gonna get respect in this joint.

01:31:52.465 --> 01:31:54.799
You got to take that stage over there.

01:31:54.967 --> 01:31:56.301
That stage is a pedestal.

01:31:57.094 --> 01:32:00.096
And when you're up there,
you're untouchable.

01:32:00.264 --> 01:32:02.432
And when you're up there,
you can have it...

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:06.061
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

01:32:06.228 --> 01:32:07.979
Any way you want it

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.274
Take Destiny.

01:32:11.442 --> 01:32:14.194
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing

01:32:15.112 --> 01:32:16.404
She does everything

01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:18.323
And Sapphire.

01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:21.076
She loves to move
She loves to groove

01:32:21.744 --> 01:32:23.495
She loves the lovin' things

01:32:25.456 --> 01:32:28.124
All night

01:32:28.584 --> 01:32:29.959
Oh, every night

01:32:30.586 --> 01:32:32.003
There's one motto here.

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.505
So hold tight

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:35.965
- Hold tight
- Baby, hold tight

01:32:36.133 --> 01:32:37.634
When it comes to the customer...

01:32:37.802 --> 01:32:41.638
She said, "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it"

01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:43.473
Any way you want it"

01:32:44.475 --> 01:32:48.687
She said, "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it"

01:32:48.854 --> 01:32:50.313
Any way you want it"

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:58.655
Gentlemen, I bring you your next star.

01:33:02.159 --> 01:33:04.285
Paul, you know I love you,
but it's a pass.

01:33:07.623 --> 01:33:09.666
Rock is dead, but the pop thing's hot.

01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:12.168
Hold on

01:33:12.336 --> 01:33:13.936
Hold on

01:33:18.175 --> 01:33:19.342
Does he rap?

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:22.345
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

01:33:22.513 --> 01:33:24.055
Any way you want it

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.849
Any way

01:33:26.016 --> 01:33:29.310
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:30.854
Any way you want it

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:35.984
Oh, she said, "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it"

01:33:36.152 --> 01:33:37.861
Any way you want it"

01:33:39.655 --> 01:33:42.532
- Any way you want it
- That's the way you need it

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.743
Any way you want it

01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:46.202
Any way

01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:49.372
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:51.374
Any way you want it

01:33:51.542 --> 01:33:53.918
Any way

01:33:54.086 --> 01:33:56.671
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

01:33:56.839 --> 01:34:03.219
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

01:34:03.387 --> 01:34:05.221
Any way you want it

01:34:05.389 --> 01:34:06.931
Any way

01:34:07.099 --> 01:34:10.059
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

01:34:10.227 --> 01:34:11.561
Any way you want it

01:34:11.729 --> 01:34:13.521
Any way

01:34:13.689 --> 01:34:16.858
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:18.943
Any way you want it

01:34:19.737 --> 01:34:23.907
Oh, she said, "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it"

01:34:24.074 --> 01:34:25.617
Any way you want it"

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:31.748
Mark. And play back.

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.585
You got silky sheets

01:34:35.753 --> 01:34:38.087
Baby, put me underneath

01:34:38.255 --> 01:34:42.842
I'm your undercover love

01:34:49.767 --> 01:34:51.392
- I'm your undercover love
- Paul!

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.770
Cut! Cut! Cut!

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:56.606
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever done. I can't do it.

01:34:56.774 --> 01:35:00.318
What's your name, Joshy-Z?
I'm trying to make you look cool.

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:04.405
I want you to look funky fresh.
But you have to not suck the next take.

01:35:04.573 --> 01:35:05.990
Back to one, everyone!

01:35:06.158 --> 01:35:10.078
- I think we should take five, you know?
- First good idea I've had all day.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:11.913
Take five, everyone!

01:35:12.289 --> 01:35:13.832
This feels all wrong, Paul.

01:35:13.999 --> 01:35:17.085
I'm telling you, this pop-band shit
is where everything is headed.

01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:20.630
Just trust me. You're working
with top, classy talent here.

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:24.634
Paul, I am Wolfgang Von Colt.

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:27.262
Not Joshy-Z, nor the Z-Guyz.

01:35:27.429 --> 01:35:31.975
No, you are not the Z-Guyz either.
You are the Z-Guyeezz.

01:35:32.142 --> 01:35:34.477
Double the E, double the Z,
double the flavor.

01:35:34.645 --> 01:35:36.646
- The "flavor"?
- Yes.

01:35:36.814 --> 01:35:38.648
What does Z even stand for?

01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:41.609
Nothing. You're over-thinking it.

01:35:41.777 --> 01:35:45.280
Names that end in Z are very popular
with the 14-to-21 year olds.

01:35:45.656 --> 01:35:48.366
We did a whole focus group on this.
Numbers don't lie.

01:35:48.534 --> 01:35:49.868
I don't want to do it, man.

01:35:50.035 --> 01:35:53.454
I have had it up to here
with your negativity, Joshy-Z.

01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:57.333
- And you know, Donny-Z and Kevy-Z and...
- Joey.

01:35:57.501 --> 01:36:01.004
Joey-Z, they're not too thrilled either.
Think about them?

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:08.177
Don't you think at least we should do
a gig before we shoot a music video?

01:36:08.345 --> 01:36:09.512
- You want a gig?
- Yeah.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.890
Watch this. Brat.

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:19.981
- Bourbon.
- Oh, Dennis. Paul Gill.

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:23.651
Paul, you got a lot of nerve calling me.

01:36:23.819 --> 01:36:24.986
Okay, okay, okay.

01:36:25.154 --> 01:36:29.824
I was a douche. I get it. But listen close.
I'm gonna make it up to you.

01:36:29.992 --> 01:36:31.034
I'm listening.

01:36:31.201 --> 01:36:34.162
I need The Bourbon tonight.
I will pack the place.

01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:37.206
I will get the whole town
to come out for it.

01:36:37.374 --> 01:36:38.708
Who's playing?

01:36:39.251 --> 01:36:40.293
Stacee Jaxx.

01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:45.798
His first solo gig. And I've got a new act
that you are gonna love.

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:48.968
And this time,
every cent goes to the house.

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:51.387
- Every cent.
- Every last penny...

01:36:51.555 --> 01:36:55.058
brother,
of which there will be millions!

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:57.560
Do we trust him?

01:37:00.731 --> 01:37:01.898
Yes.

01:37:03.859 --> 01:37:04.901
Okay, deal.

01:37:06.862 --> 01:37:08.738
You're one lucky son of a gun.

01:37:08.906 --> 01:37:10.073
See you tonight.

01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:14.285
- Louise, call the PR department.
- Paul, I need...

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:16.079
Shush. I'm rolling here.

01:37:16.789 --> 01:37:20.750
Call the PR department and tell them I
need to buy all the advertising blocks...

01:37:20.918 --> 01:37:23.294
on every drive-time radio station
this afternoon.

01:37:23.462 --> 01:37:27.423
Stacee's Rolling Stone cover.
It hit the newsstands an hour ago.

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:29.759
How bad is it?

01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:31.803
Stacee Jaxx.

01:37:34.556 --> 01:37:35.598
On the phone?

01:37:43.148 --> 01:37:44.691
Oh, my God.

01:37:58.789 --> 01:38:00.039
Hey.

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:02.834
Hey Man.

01:38:04.586 --> 01:38:05.795
Man.

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:11.551
Stace. Seriously...

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:16.848
Can you please ask Hey Man
to just chill for a second or two, man?

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.019
Yes, I'm on that. Don't worry about it.

01:38:21.186 --> 01:38:24.897
I just tore the editors a new one.
You should've heard me, man. Ho, ho, ho.

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:28.985
- Shit!
- Page 68, second paragraph.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.780
- Read.
- Okay.

01:38:38.037 --> 01:38:39.245
Okay.

01:38:45.836 --> 01:38:49.380
"Stacee Jaxx will tell you
he's a cowboy..."

01:38:49.548 --> 01:38:51.799
but lately he seems more like a...

01:38:53.343 --> 01:38:56.345
'boy-cow' who's gotten lost
in the herd.

01:38:57.264 --> 01:39:01.684
But the biggest danger is the man
who seems to be calling the shots...

01:39:01.852 --> 01:39:05.188
his manager Paul Gill,
a man so oily...

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:10.193
"...Exxon might want to reconsider
buying stock in him."

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:14.530
Okay, well, you know,
that could also mean that I'm real slick.

01:39:14.698 --> 01:39:16.532
Because I am. There's no such thing
as bad publicity.

01:39:21.872 --> 01:39:25.708
Okay. That was funny.

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:28.586
"Even the legendary Bourbon Room
isn't sacred."

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:32.381
This reporter learned that Stacee Jaxx
and Paul Gill...

01:39:32.549 --> 01:39:37.512
"...walked away with virtually
all of the night's proceeds."

01:39:39.348 --> 01:39:41.057
That part.

01:39:42.017 --> 01:39:43.142
Is that true?

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:51.400
It's not not true.

01:39:51.902 --> 01:39:55.905
It's more more true...

01:39:56.073 --> 01:39:58.491
than I would perhaps prefer.

01:40:01.453 --> 01:40:04.413
Okay, yes, I'll be clearer about that.

01:40:04.581 --> 01:40:07.625
No more bullshit. No more bullshit.

01:40:09.128 --> 01:40:14.048
I wish that the true part were falser.

01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:23.808
You know what, man?
Let's start all over again.

01:40:23.976 --> 01:40:27.103
Let's turn that frown
the right way around.

01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:28.688
What do you say, sad clown?

01:40:29.148 --> 01:40:33.776
I got something for you. One-of-a-kind.
Ha-ha.

01:40:33.944 --> 01:40:36.737
One hundred and fifty years old.

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:38.614
Priceless.

01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:42.869
Look, so what if some...

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:46.289
hack journalist
took some potshots at you?

01:40:46.456 --> 01:40:49.292
All your life,
you have wanted to be number one.

01:40:50.127 --> 01:40:53.129
You still are number one.
Let's toast to that.

01:40:53.338 --> 01:40:56.299
And I'm telling you,
I'm gonna get that reporter fired...

01:40:56.466 --> 01:40:58.968
so please don't dump that on my head.

01:41:00.762 --> 01:41:01.846
I would never do that.

01:41:20.866 --> 01:41:22.825
150-year-old Scotch.

01:41:27.164 --> 01:41:28.998
It's priceless.

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:37.506
You're fired, Paul.

01:41:39.176 --> 01:41:40.676
Hey Man.

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:47.558
It just goes to show
that sin doesn't sell anymore.

01:41:47.726 --> 01:41:50.061
And if Dennis Dupree
can't pay by midnight, well...

01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:54.023
Then it looks like Los Angeles
will be able to reclaim the real estate.

01:42:08.121 --> 01:42:09.330
Drew?

01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:14.210
Sherrie. What are you doing here?

01:42:14.544 --> 01:42:16.545
Sorry. I didn't realize
you owned the place.

01:42:16.713 --> 01:42:17.755
Wait, wait, wait.

01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:21.676
How are you?

01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:26.389
I'm great. Quitting The Bourbon was
the best thing that could've happened.

01:42:26.848 --> 01:42:28.224
Yeah.

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:29.809
Me too.

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.063
What are you wearing?

01:42:35.065 --> 01:42:39.902
This is kind of my new look...

01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:41.570
for the band I'm in.

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:43.739
The Z-Guyeezz.

01:42:43.907 --> 01:42:45.574
- Yeah, I've heard of them.
- No.

01:42:46.076 --> 01:42:47.243
Not them.

01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:48.744
The Z-Guyeezz.

01:42:49.496 --> 01:42:52.581
Double the E, double the Z,
double the flavor.

01:42:53.166 --> 01:42:55.584
And we're playing The Bourbon tonight.

01:42:59.631 --> 01:43:02.300
How about you? You singing?

01:43:05.262 --> 01:43:06.595
No...

01:43:07.764 --> 01:43:09.307
I'm dancing.

01:43:09.933 --> 01:43:13.019
Aerobics. I teach aerobics.

01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:21.777
Ever see Stacee again?

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:25.614
- What do you mean?
- After your big fling.

01:43:27.492 --> 01:43:30.202
- Wait, you think he and I...?
- I don't think.

01:43:31.121 --> 01:43:32.371
I saw you.

01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:35.791
- What did you see?
- The night I played.

01:43:35.959 --> 01:43:39.628
You were walking out of his dressing room,
he was zipping up his pants.

01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:49.221
You think I slept with Stacee Jaxx?

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:54.185
You didn't?

01:43:56.521 --> 01:43:58.647
I was in love with you.

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:04.487
Drew...

01:44:05.364 --> 01:44:07.365
L.A. really isn't working out for me.

01:44:10.369 --> 01:44:11.994
It's time to go home.

01:44:13.497 --> 01:44:15.998
- Sherrie...
- What?

01:44:17.459 --> 01:44:22.963
Sherrie, can we please just start over?

01:44:23.131 --> 01:44:27.093
- Pretend nothing...
- I'm a stripper at the Venus Club.

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.011
I'm in a boy band.

01:44:33.183 --> 01:44:34.683
You win.

01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:38.854
No, wait.

01:44:41.858 --> 01:44:43.067
Here.

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:49.907
This is something Wayne,
Ziff and I recorded last week.

01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:53.953
That song I was writing.

01:44:55.497 --> 01:44:57.248
The one about us.

01:44:59.876 --> 01:45:01.377
Please...

01:45:02.045 --> 01:45:03.712
listen to it.

01:45:12.889 --> 01:45:14.348
Sure.

01:45:31.032 --> 01:45:35.619
We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night

01:45:36.913 --> 01:45:39.915
Although we both lie close together

01:45:40.292 --> 01:45:43.169
We feel miles apart inside

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:47.423
Was it something I said
Or something I did?

01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:50.176
Did my words not come out right?

01:45:50.635 --> 01:45:53.596
Though I tried not to hurt you

01:45:54.097 --> 01:45:55.264
Though I tried

01:45:55.432 --> 01:45:58.100
- But I guess that's why they say
- But I guess that's why they say

01:45:58.268 --> 01:46:02.188
- Every rose has its thorn
- Every rose has its thorn

01:46:04.065 --> 01:46:10.571
Just like every night has its dawn

01:46:10.947 --> 01:46:17.828
Just like every cowboy
Sings his sad, sad song

01:46:18.788 --> 01:46:23.709
Every rose has its thorn

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.085
Yeah, it does

01:46:25.670 --> 01:46:27.463
Though it's been a while now

01:46:27.797 --> 01:46:30.508
I can still feel so much pain

01:46:31.801 --> 01:46:34.803
Like a knife that cuts you
The wound heals

01:46:34.971 --> 01:46:41.060
But the scar
That scar remains

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:42.728
Yes, it does

01:47:03.166 --> 01:47:05.543
I know I could have saved our love
That night

01:47:05.710 --> 01:47:08.337
If I'd known what to say

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:11.757
Instead of making love

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:14.927
We both made our separate ways

01:47:15.136 --> 01:47:17.012
And now I hear you've found

01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:18.556
Somebody new

01:47:18.723 --> 01:47:21.767
And that I never meant
That much to you

01:47:21.935 --> 01:47:24.853
To hear that tears me up inside

01:47:25.021 --> 01:47:28.524
And to see you cuts me like a knife

01:47:28.692 --> 01:47:31.277
Oh, every

01:47:31.444 --> 01:47:35.573
Every rose has its thorn

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:43.163
Just like every night has its dawn

01:47:43.373 --> 01:47:49.378
Just like every cowboy
Sings his sad, sad song

01:47:49.546 --> 01:47:50.588
Yeah

01:47:50.755 --> 01:47:55.050
Every rose has its thorn

01:47:55.218 --> 01:47:56.719
Oh, yeah

01:47:56.886 --> 01:47:59.486
Every rose has its thorn

01:48:16.114 --> 01:48:17.573
Asshole!

01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:21.869
Swingin' so hard,
Forgot to lock the door

01:48:22.037 --> 01:48:24.079
In walks her daddy,
Standin' six foot four

01:48:24.247 --> 01:48:26.498
He said, "You ain't gonna swing
With my daughter no more"

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:27.833
Justice.

01:48:28.001 --> 01:48:31.128
Stacee Jaxx. It's been too long.

01:48:31.296 --> 01:48:35.424
A sweet surprise
Tastes so good, make a grown man cry

01:48:35.759 --> 01:48:37.635
So you see anything you like?

01:48:38.219 --> 01:48:40.262
She's my cherry pie

01:48:40.555 --> 01:48:43.641
Put a smile on your face 10 miles wide

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:48.520
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie

01:48:48.855 --> 01:48:51.690
Sweet cherry pie

01:48:59.282 --> 01:49:01.825
How much to make my pain go away?

01:49:03.119 --> 01:49:04.536
I just dance.

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.538
I like to dance.

01:49:09.751 --> 01:49:11.669
Ten thousand.

01:49:21.096 --> 01:49:22.680
Why not?

01:49:48.623 --> 01:49:51.667
It's early morning, the sun comes out

01:49:51.835 --> 01:49:55.754
Last night was shaking and pretty loud

01:49:55.922 --> 01:49:59.717
My cat is purring and scratches my skin

01:49:59.884 --> 01:50:03.554
So what is wrong with another sin?

01:50:03.805 --> 01:50:07.349
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.978
So give her inches and feed her well

01:50:11.688 --> 01:50:15.065
More days to come, new places to go

01:50:15.233 --> 01:50:20.946
I've got to leave, it's time for the show

01:50:22.866 --> 01:50:30.866
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

01:50:40.008 --> 01:50:43.761
My body is burning,
It starts to shout

01:50:44.012 --> 01:50:47.514
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud

01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:51.351
Lust is in cages still storm breaks loose

01:50:51.644 --> 01:50:55.397
I just have to make it
with someone I choose

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:59.151
- The night is calling, I have to go
- The night is calling, I have to go

01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:01.153
The wolf is hungry

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:02.988
- He runs the show
- He runs the show

01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:07.034
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win

01:51:07.243 --> 01:51:12.498
- On the hunt tonight for love at first sting
- On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

01:51:15.126 --> 01:51:20.672
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

01:51:21.090 --> 01:51:22.549
Are you ready, baby?

01:51:22.717 --> 01:51:30.349
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:34.353
Rock you like a hurricane

01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:46.198
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:48.242
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

01:51:48.409 --> 01:51:55.040
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

01:51:57.877 --> 01:51:59.795
- Here I am!
- Here I am!

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:28.031
We don't really want this.

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:51.096
Sherrie? What's wrong, honey?

01:52:51.264 --> 01:52:53.473
I'm fine, I'm just a little...

01:52:54.684 --> 01:52:55.934
ruined.

01:52:58.104 --> 01:52:59.855
I never should've come to L.A.

01:53:00.023 --> 01:53:03.775
You ain't ruined, baby.
But you will be if you stay here.

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:07.779
It's not fame and fortune
you came looking for, Sherrie.

01:53:08.156 --> 01:53:09.865
It's love.

01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:13.327
And love left this place a long time ago.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.621
Sherrie?

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:18.040
Someone dropped this off for you.

01:53:22.003 --> 01:53:24.963
"Sometimes things that are lost
can be found again.

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:27.633
Don't stop believing. Love, Drew."

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.398
Rolling Stone. Also, we're closed.

01:53:43.566 --> 01:53:46.318
Put Cinderella on the phone.

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:49.655
Are you talking about the fake person
with the stepmother?

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:52.532
She stuck her tongue in my ear.

01:53:53.576 --> 01:53:55.494
She blew my world up.

01:53:55.662 --> 01:53:57.496
Are you messing with me right now?

01:53:57.664 --> 01:54:01.083
Is it someone that is trying to really
freak me out? Because it's working.

01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:02.459
This goddess...

01:54:02.627 --> 01:54:04.878
she put a mirror up to Stacee Jaxx.

01:54:05.046 --> 01:54:06.672
You're talking about Constance...

01:54:06.839 --> 01:54:09.508
not Cinderella, which...
I guess they sound similar.

01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:10.842
Constance Sack.

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:12.344
Constance?

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:14.680
Put her on.

01:54:14.847 --> 01:54:16.765
She's not here. She's at The Bourbon...

01:54:16.975 --> 01:54:20.352
in Los Angeles, and she's covering
Stacee Jaxx's first solo gig.

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.479
So you can go there and weird her out.

01:54:23.856 --> 01:54:25.357
I have a gig?

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:28.527
Are you Stacee Jaxx?

01:54:29.487 --> 01:54:30.570
Hello?

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:35.909
Great. That's not gonna make me feel
like I'm gonna get killed tonight.

01:54:36.828 --> 01:54:40.622
People!
We must obey petty bureaucracy.

01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:43.417
It's what separates us from the beasts.

01:54:43.584 --> 01:54:46.420
Just remember the moves, right?
Remember the attitude.

01:54:46.587 --> 01:54:49.089
And make sure that those
head mikes are turned off.

01:54:49.257 --> 01:54:51.633
God forbid anyone hears
your actual voices.

01:54:51.801 --> 01:54:53.510
Oh! Nice of you to show.

01:54:53.886 --> 01:54:55.762
I don't understand why we can't sing.

01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:58.724
It's better this way.
Less chance to screw up, right?

01:54:58.891 --> 01:55:00.851
Wait. We're not singing?

01:55:01.019 --> 01:55:03.020
All we gotta do is mouth the words.

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:05.897
- So we're lip-synching?
- Just relax.

01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:09.026
It's done all the time.
Pretty soon everyone will do it.

01:55:09.193 --> 01:55:10.527
Does Dennis know?

01:55:10.695 --> 01:55:14.072
Don't worry your pretty little head about
Dennis. I'm saving his ass tonight.

01:55:14.532 --> 01:55:16.116
All right, fellas? Come on. Let's go.

01:55:16.284 --> 01:55:17.743
Everybody in.

01:55:23.458 --> 01:55:26.376
As you can see,
this club is totally out of control.

01:55:26.544 --> 01:55:28.670
But, Mitch, this ends tonight.

01:55:29.005 --> 01:55:32.716
It's time we wiped the filth off
the streets of this great city.

01:55:32.884 --> 01:55:35.969
The people of Los Angeles
are not gonna take it anymore.

01:55:36.137 --> 01:55:40.640
- Powerful words from Patricia Whitmore.
- You! Mrs. Mayor!

01:55:40.808 --> 01:55:42.059
Why are you so uptight?

01:55:42.226 --> 01:55:46.563
You lot need to feel the wind of change.
Blow the cobwebs out of your gussets.

01:55:47.023 --> 01:55:50.108
We built this city on rock 'n' roll.

01:55:50.276 --> 01:55:51.818
- Right?
- Yeah, we did!

01:55:51.986 --> 01:55:53.487
We built this city

01:55:53.988 --> 01:55:56.364
My grandfather's father
built this city!

01:55:56.532 --> 01:55:58.450
We built this city on rock 'n' roll

01:55:58.618 --> 01:56:00.327
Built this city

01:56:00.495 --> 01:56:02.120
How dare you!

01:56:02.288 --> 01:56:06.500
We built this city on rock 'n' roll

01:56:07.001 --> 01:56:09.169
Who counts the money

01:56:10.213 --> 01:56:12.005
Underneath the bar?

01:56:14.050 --> 01:56:16.510
Who rides the wrecking ball

01:56:16.886 --> 01:56:19.513
Into our guitars?

01:56:20.264 --> 01:56:22.682
Don't tell us you need us

01:56:24.018 --> 01:56:26.937
'Cause we're the ship of fools

01:56:27.396 --> 01:56:30.232
Lookin' for America

01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.818
Crawlin' through your schools

01:56:33.945 --> 01:56:36.029
We're not gonna take it

01:56:36.197 --> 01:56:37.239
We built this city

01:56:37.406 --> 01:56:39.366
No, we ain't gonna take it

01:56:39.534 --> 01:56:40.742
We built this city

01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:43.954
We're not gonna take it anymore

01:56:44.122 --> 01:56:47.666
We built this city on rock 'n' roll

01:56:47.834 --> 01:56:51.086
- We're not gonna take it
- We built this city

01:56:51.254 --> 01:56:54.256
- No, we ain't gonna take it
- We built this city

01:56:54.423 --> 01:56:57.384
We're not gonna take it anymore

01:56:57.552 --> 01:57:05.552
We built this city on rock 'n' roll

01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:14.943
Stacee Jaxx has just arrived...

01:57:15.111 --> 01:57:16.403
for his first solo show!

01:57:16.571 --> 01:57:20.574
It seems history is no doubt about to be
made again at The Bourbon Room tonight!

01:57:20.741 --> 01:57:21.867
Hey!

01:57:22.577 --> 01:57:23.743
No! No, no!

01:57:24.245 --> 01:57:26.454
Where is the police
when you need them?

01:57:26.622 --> 01:57:30.083
Hey, you! Hey, policeman!
You can't let him in there!

01:57:30.418 --> 01:57:31.543
Here, hold this.

01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:33.753
Stacee, excited about the show?

01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:36.298
Thank you.

01:57:36.799 --> 01:57:38.967
Are you listening to me?

01:57:41.012 --> 01:57:42.596
What are you doing?

01:57:43.598 --> 01:57:45.640
He can't go in there!

01:57:46.475 --> 01:57:48.268
Oh, God!

01:57:53.774 --> 01:57:56.943
You stay away from me.

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.122
Patty.

01:58:12.418 --> 01:58:14.628
Your tits have held up well.

01:58:20.509 --> 01:58:22.469
Oh, my God!

01:58:33.648 --> 01:58:38.318
Mitch, this is breaking news.
I have in my hand an album.

01:58:38.486 --> 01:58:42.030
It's Arsenal 1977 Live at The Bourbon.
Great album, incidentally.

01:58:42.198 --> 01:58:45.325
If I could just draw your attention
to the inside sleeve.

01:58:45.493 --> 01:58:47.661
This photograph here of a nymph...

01:58:47.828 --> 01:58:52.040
apparently about to gargle
Stacee Jaxx's body porridge...

01:58:52.208 --> 01:58:56.419
is none other than Patricia Whitmore,
the mayor's wife!

01:58:56.587 --> 01:58:59.172
This is our Watergate!

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:00.757
Rock lives on!

01:59:00.925 --> 01:59:02.259
You saw it here live.

01:59:02.426 --> 01:59:06.554
The mayor's wife appears to be an
ex-groupie of none other than Stacee Jaxx!

01:59:06.722 --> 01:59:08.556
Sweet baby Jesus.

01:59:08.724 --> 01:59:09.975
Stop! You cut that!

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:19.526
Hey, look. It's Stacee Jaxx.

01:59:31.455 --> 01:59:33.999
I'm telling you, it's Stacee Jaxx.

01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:35.792
I'm telling you.

01:59:36.877 --> 01:59:38.545
- Sure?
- Oh, my God.

01:59:38.713 --> 01:59:40.213
Oh, my God!

01:59:40.381 --> 01:59:42.424
Oh, my God! Stacee!

01:59:51.517 --> 01:59:53.059
Yeah.

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:21.963
I'm sorry about the article.

02:00:23.799 --> 02:00:25.759
Open your mouth.

02:00:56.791 --> 02:00:58.166
Ladies and gentlemen...

02:00:58.334 --> 02:01:01.544
you foul and pestilent congregation
of vapors...

02:01:01.712 --> 02:01:04.005
we're gonna have a fantastic
evening tonight!

02:01:04.173 --> 02:01:07.342
Later, performing on this stage,
we'll see Stacee Jaxx!

02:01:08.094 --> 02:01:09.552
But before that...

02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:12.972
we will have the less important...

02:01:13.140 --> 02:01:14.808
but somehow worthwhile...

02:01:14.975 --> 02:01:19.187
making their debut here on
The Bourbon stage, the...

02:01:20.147 --> 02:01:23.191
"Z-Guyeezz."

02:01:24.318 --> 02:01:25.735
Give it a whirl, I suppose.

02:01:25.986 --> 02:01:27.529
Rock 'n' roll!

02:01:27.738 --> 02:01:29.614
So may I introduce to you...

02:01:29.824 --> 02:01:32.158
the guys you've known
for all these days:

02:01:32.326 --> 02:01:33.368
The Z-Guyeezz.

02:01:33.536 --> 02:01:35.286
- Donny-Z.
- Kevy-Z.

02:01:35.454 --> 02:01:36.496
Me, Joey-Z.

02:01:36.664 --> 02:01:37.831
And Joshy-Z.

02:01:37.998 --> 02:01:40.166
You
Me

02:01:40.334 --> 02:01:43.044
One day we can have a baby

02:01:43.212 --> 02:01:44.337
Is that Drew?

02:01:44.505 --> 02:01:46.172
I'm afraid it is, yes.

02:01:46.507 --> 02:01:48.383
Oh, my God, I just threw up.

02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:50.176
Where?

02:01:50.344 --> 02:01:51.719
In my pants.

02:01:53.055 --> 02:01:54.931
Out of my ass.

02:01:55.558 --> 02:01:57.517
Hey, they're lip-synching!

02:01:58.686 --> 02:02:02.230
Baby girl, I wanna still be

02:02:02.398 --> 02:02:05.775
- Who is this?
- The Z-Guyeezz.

02:02:06.277 --> 02:02:07.944
Great, right?

02:02:08.112 --> 02:02:09.988
Where is Stacee?

02:02:10.156 --> 02:02:11.531
Really sick.

02:02:16.954 --> 02:02:21.124
Baby, we've been talking too much

02:02:21.542 --> 02:02:26.087
I just wanna stare at your...

02:02:26.338 --> 02:02:28.381
Put my hands around it

02:02:28.549 --> 02:02:30.216
Squeeze, touch

02:02:31.385 --> 02:02:32.594
Thank you.

02:02:33.304 --> 02:02:34.888
Don't rush

02:02:36.223 --> 02:02:38.892
Hey! Ho, ho, ho!
What the hell are you doing?

02:02:48.777 --> 02:02:51.321
Sherrie, I'm so sorry.

02:02:51.489 --> 02:02:53.364
- Drew, stop!
- I should have trusted you.

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.116
It's okay. It's okay.

02:02:57.661 --> 02:02:59.245
You can't go home.

02:03:10.758 --> 02:03:12.842
Your new band sucks.

02:03:13.511 --> 02:03:15.970
And, yeah, this? This has gotta go.

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:21.100
You got L-O-V
Baby, I could be the E

02:03:21.268 --> 02:03:25.647
Hey, Joshy-Z, if all these people
want refunds, my club is closed.

02:03:27.149 --> 02:03:28.858
Yeah

02:03:29.026 --> 02:03:30.151
Wait.

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:33.154
Just wait right here.

02:03:33.697 --> 02:03:34.948
Hi.

02:03:36.492 --> 02:03:38.743
I want my money back!

02:03:38.953 --> 02:03:40.078
Oh, Hey Man.

02:03:42.456 --> 02:03:45.166
Oh, my God.

02:03:48.963 --> 02:03:50.129
"I owe you this."

02:03:50.464 --> 02:03:53.216
"Your rock brother, Stacee."

02:03:53.717 --> 02:03:56.219
God! That Stacee Jaxx.

02:03:56.804 --> 02:03:58.638
He gives until it hurts.

02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:15.238
That's right, get him off!

02:04:20.202 --> 02:04:21.494
Hey!

02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:24.747
You little shit.

02:04:24.915 --> 02:04:27.083
You just destroyed your one shot.

02:04:27.251 --> 02:04:30.211
I didn't destroy anything, Paul.
I took a stand.

02:04:30.379 --> 02:04:31.588
Really? For what?

02:04:31.755 --> 02:04:33.214
Rock 'n' roll, baby.

02:04:35.342 --> 02:04:37.760
Oh, rock is over, pal.

02:04:38.053 --> 02:04:40.597
Rock is dead!

02:04:42.308 --> 02:04:46.019
That's right, Hey Man,
rock will never die.

02:04:51.775 --> 02:04:53.943
All right! Well, now that that's over...

02:04:54.111 --> 02:04:55.528
are you guys ready to rock?

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:03.077
This is a very special song,
written by a very special person.

02:05:06.874 --> 02:05:09.250
Just a small-town girl

02:05:10.127 --> 02:05:13.046
Livin' in a lonely world

02:05:14.089 --> 02:05:19.844
She took the midnight train
Goin' anywhere

02:05:22.097 --> 02:05:24.474
Just a city boy

02:05:25.559 --> 02:05:28.645
Born and raised in South Detroit

02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:35.485
He took the midnight train
Goin' anywhere

02:05:51.794 --> 02:05:54.796
A singer in a smoky room

02:05:55.631 --> 02:05:58.633
The smell of wine
And cheap perfume

02:05:59.301 --> 02:06:01.803
For a smile they can share the night

02:06:01.970 --> 02:06:06.182
It goes on and on and on and on

02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:10.228
- Strangers waitin'
- Strangers waitin'

02:06:10.938 --> 02:06:13.356
- Up and down the boulevard
- Up and down the boulevard

02:06:13.524 --> 02:06:19.821
- Their shadows searching in the night
- Their shadows searching in the night

02:06:21.365 --> 02:06:25.034
- Streetlights, people
- Streetlights, people

02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:29.122
- Livin' just to find emotion
- Livin' just to find emotion

02:06:29.289 --> 02:06:36.963
- Hidin' somewhere in the night
- Hidin' somewhere in the night

02:06:45.013 --> 02:06:47.849
Workin' hard to get my fill

02:06:49.268 --> 02:06:52.145
Everybody wants a thrill

02:06:52.646 --> 02:06:55.314
Payin' anything to roll the dice

02:06:55.482 --> 02:06:58.901
Just one more time

02:07:00.195 --> 02:07:01.612
Some will win

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.865
Some will lose

02:07:04.366 --> 02:07:07.493
- Some were born to sing the blues
- Some were born to sing the blues

02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:10.204
Oh, the movie never ends

02:07:10.372 --> 02:07:15.460
It goes on and on and on and on

02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:19.380
Hey, put your hands together, Los Angeles,
for the man who wrote this song...

02:07:19.548 --> 02:07:21.174
and my very special friends...

02:07:21.341 --> 02:07:22.800
Von Colt!

02:07:23.177 --> 02:07:26.053
- Strangers waitin'
- Strangers waitin'

02:07:27.097 --> 02:07:29.599
- Up and down the boulevard
- Up and down the boulevard

02:07:29.767 --> 02:07:36.022
- Their shadows searching in the night
- Their shadows searching in the night

02:07:37.691 --> 02:07:41.611
- Streetlights, people
- Streetlights, people

02:07:42.613 --> 02:07:45.364
- Livin' just to find emotion
- Livin' just to find emotion

02:07:45.532 --> 02:07:52.747
- Hidin' somewhere in the night
- Hidin' somewhere in the night

02:08:08.472 --> 02:08:11.390
Don't stop believin'

02:08:11.558 --> 02:08:15.645
Yeah, hold on to that feelin'

02:08:15.813 --> 02:08:23.194
Streetlights, people

02:08:23.487 --> 02:08:26.572
Don't stop believin'

02:08:27.491 --> 02:08:30.743
Hold on to that feelin'

02:08:31.119 --> 02:08:36.082
Streetlights, people

02:08:38.752 --> 02:08:42.380
Don't stop believin'

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:44.048
Oh, hold on

02:08:44.258 --> 02:08:46.092
Hold on to that feelin'

02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:53.766
Streetlights, people

02:08:53.934 --> 02:08:55.934
Don't stop
