WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:09.443
SIENNA, PLEASE STOP
TALKING TO ME. I'M NOT
HAVING THIS CONVERSA--

00:09.543 --> 00:12.413
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS. OH!

00:12.513 --> 00:15.749
( classical instrumental
music playing )

00:24.192 --> 00:25.893
April:
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.096
HE WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO TELL ANYONE.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.598
BECAUSE IT'S
A PRIVATE MATTER.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.803
NO, I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHO YOUR UNCLE IS.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.572
YEAH, MY PHONE--
MY PHONE IS DYING.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.676
LISTEN, WHAT EXACTLY
DID KYLE TELL YOU?

00:42.776 --> 00:45.346
JESUS.
WHAT THE FUCK?

00:45.446 --> 00:48.782
SIENNA, BECAUSE IT'S
NONE OF YOUR--

00:50.418 --> 00:52.686
I HAVE TO GO.
MY PHONE IS OUT OF JUICE.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.489
OH, WOULD YOU JUST SHUT UP?
I WANT YOU TO HEAR ME.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.925
YOU HAVE
NO FUCKING IDEA WHAT--

00:58.025 --> 01:00.661
SIENNA? SIENNA?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.930
SHIT.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.199
( theme music playing )

01:35.796 --> 01:39.900
- I'M GLAD YOU CAME.
- I SENT YOU AN EMAIL.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.303
I KNOW.
THANKS.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.239
BUT I'M JUST GLAD
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

01:45.339 --> 01:48.142
YEAH. DO YOU HAVE
AN iPHONE CHARGER?

01:48.242 --> 01:50.778
- NO.
- YOU DON'T HAVE
AN iPHONE?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.980
- NO.
- DO YOU HAVE
A BLACKBERRY?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.482
NOT ANYMORE.
I USED TO.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.917
HOW DO YOU
ORGANIZE YOUR LIFE?

01:57.017 --> 01:59.320
I'VE GOT A DATEBOOK
ON MY DESK.

01:59.420 --> 02:03.291
- KICKING IT OLD SCHOOL.
- MM-HMM.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.092
HOW WAS YOUR WEEK?

02:05.193 --> 02:07.428
I BET YOU'RE ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO
STILL HAS A LANDLINE.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.930
- ACTUALLY I DO.
- GREAT. CAN I USE IT?

02:10.030 --> 02:13.634
- NOW?
- JUST FOR A MINUTE.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.307
WOULD YOU LIKE TO WAIT
TILL THE SESSION IS OVER?

02:20.474 --> 02:23.911
YEAH.
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.392
- ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?
- I'M FINE.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.161
THIS-- THIS HAPPENS
WHEN I GET ANGRY.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.164
TREMORS RUN
IN OUR FAMILY.
IT'S GENETIC.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.867
YOU MUST BE
REALLY ANGRY.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.403
I GUESS SO.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.272
I ACTUALLY LIKE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.274
IT'S THIS WEIRD
OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.908
YOU KNOW
WHAT'D HELP, I BET?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.677
- WHAT?
- USING YOUR PHONE.

02:58.312 --> 03:02.483
WOULD YOU
LIKE TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:02.583 --> 03:05.986
WHY YOUR HAND IS SHAKING?
WHY YOU'RE SO ANGRY?

03:06.086 --> 03:09.056
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHY I CAN'T
JUST MAKE A CALL?

03:09.156 --> 03:11.325
WELL, YOU CAN,
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK

03:11.425 --> 03:13.927
THAT IT'S THE BEST USE
OF OUR TIME TOGETHER.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.598
YOU'RE SURE
IT CAN'T WAIT TILL
THE END OF THE SESSION?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.115
FUCK HER.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.218
- FUCK WHO?
- SIENNA NEWHOUSE,

03:38.319 --> 03:40.288
KYLE'S NEW GIRLFRIEND.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.256
DO YOU KNOW
SHE HAS A PUBLICIST?

03:42.356 --> 03:45.025
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHO SHE IS.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.296
YEAH, I GUESS
YOU DON'T REALLY
FOLLOW THAT WORLD.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.664
I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW
THAT WORLD EITHER,

03:50.764 --> 03:54.134
EXCEPT NOW APPARENTLY
I'M STUCK IN IT,

03:54.234 --> 03:56.937
MIRED IN ITS
PERIPHERAL MUCK.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.972
THANK YOU
FOR THAT, KYLE.

03:59.072 --> 04:03.344
I REMEMBER LAST WEEK
THAT YOU MENTIONED
SHE WAS WEALTHY.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.780
SHE'S FILTHY FUCKING RICH.
I TOLD KYLE I HAD CANCER

04:06.880 --> 04:09.817
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE DOES? SHE OFFERS
TO PAY FOR MY TREATMENT.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.053
WE'RE AT A SCHOOL,
YOU STUPID CUNT.
WE HAVE INSURANCE.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.356
IF YOU EVER
ACTUALLY WENT TO CLASS,
YOU MIGHT KNOW THAT.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.991
I MEAN, I TOLD KYLE
NOT TO TELL ANYONE

04:18.091 --> 04:21.161
AND HE TOLD HER DELIBERATELY
SO THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO DEAL WITH ME.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.798
I HATE THEM BOTH.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.468
I DON'T GET THIS.
HOW DOES TELLING
SIENNA ENSURE

04:27.568 --> 04:30.037
THAT KYLE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU?

04:30.137 --> 04:33.173
I TOLD HIM
NOT TO TELL HER.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.410
SO HE BETRAYED
YOUR TRUST.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.245
NO, IT'S MORE
THAN THAT.

04:38.346 --> 04:42.450
LOOK, KYLE KNOWS ME,
HE KNOWS WHAT I CAN
AND CAN'T TOLERATE.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.353
HE KNOWS THAT IF HE TELLS
HIS GIRLFRIEND I HAVE CANCER

04:45.453 --> 04:47.621
AND IF SHE CALLS ME,
I WILL HANG UP ON HER

04:47.721 --> 04:49.957
AND NEVER SPEAK
TO EITHER OF THEM AGAIN,
WHICH IS WHAT HE DID,

04:50.057 --> 04:52.626
WHAT SHE DID
AND WHAT I DID.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.195
SO THAT'S WHO
YOU WERE TALKING TO
WHEN YOU ARRIVED?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.998
AND DID YOU
HANG UP ON HER?

04:58.098 --> 05:00.634
NO, THE PHONE DIED,

05:00.734 --> 05:03.170
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE
TO CALL HER BACK

05:03.270 --> 05:05.739
SO I CAN
HANG UP ON HER.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.209
COULD I JUST USE
YOUR PHONE?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.545
PLEASE, IT'LL TAKE
TWO MINUTES.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.814
I CAN'T
CONCENTRATE AT ALL.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.051
SHE CAN'T GET
THE LAST WORD, PAUL.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.053
I CAN'T DIE
AND SHE GETS TO GO ON

05:20.153 --> 05:21.855
AND LIVE
THE PERFECT LIFE

05:21.955 --> 05:24.525
WITH THE ONLY PERSON
I'VE EVER LOVED.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.696
OKAY.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.475
THANK YOU.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.546
COULD I HAVE
A MOMENT?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.616
OKAY.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.765
WOW, HE'S KEEPING
YOU BUSY.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.837
LISTEN.
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

06:09.937 --> 06:12.540
( sighs )

06:13.607 --> 06:15.709
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT...

06:16.777 --> 06:18.479
NO.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.652
SIENNA,
I AM NOT...

06:32.726 --> 06:34.161
PAUL.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.586
SO...

07:00.320 --> 07:03.023
WHAT DID
YOU SAY TO HER?

07:03.123 --> 07:05.593
I DON'T KNOW.

07:05.693 --> 07:09.262
I TOLD HER MY LIFE WAS NONE
OF HER FUCKING BUSINESS.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.665
THAT MADE YOU
FEEL BETTER?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.471
DID-- DID YOU TALK
TO KYLE AS WELL?

07:17.571 --> 07:20.508
NO. I'LL CALL HIM LATER.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.745
YOU SAID THAT HE WAS

07:24.845 --> 07:27.214
THE ONLY PERSON THAT
YOU HAD EVER LOVED.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.651
YEAH.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.787
CAN I ASK YOU
HOW IT FEELS

07:33.887 --> 07:36.456
TO SEE HIM
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

07:36.557 --> 07:39.693
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
SEEN THEM TOGETHER.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.428
NO?

07:41.529 --> 07:44.832
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE EXISTED UNTIL RECENTLY.

07:44.932 --> 07:48.035
I MEAN, I KNEW SHE EXISTED--
EVERYONE KNOWS SHE EXISTS.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.404
HER FATHER DONATED
THE MONEY FOR THE NEW LIBRARY.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.507
SHE--

07:53.607 --> 07:56.877
SHE WEARS ALL THESE
RIDICULOUS SCARVES

07:56.977 --> 07:59.046
IN THESE ABSURD
CONFIGURATIONS.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.448
YOU SHOULDN'T
WEAR SCARVES LIKE THAT
UNLESS YOU'RE FRENCH.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.851
( chuckles )
WHY NOT?

08:03.951 --> 08:07.721
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST THINK THEY LOOK
STUPID ON AMERICAN GIRLS.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.724
INCLUDING SIENNA?

08:13.193 --> 08:16.764
NO, NOT INCLUDING SIENNA.

08:19.567 --> 08:23.704
YOU SAID YOU TOLD
KYLE ABOUT YOUR CANCER.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.974
I DID.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.876
IT WAS...

08:30.578 --> 08:32.646
PRETTY FUNNY THE WAY
IT ALL WENT DOWN.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.716
WELL, I COULD USE
A LAUGH.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.118
YOU WANT
TO TELL ME?

08:39.452 --> 08:41.589
WE HADN'T SPOKEN
SINCE WE BROKE UP

08:41.689 --> 08:43.657
BECAUSE WE'RE, LIKE,

08:45.292 --> 08:46.894
RADIOACTIVE TOGETHER.

08:47.828 --> 08:51.264
BUT A FEW MONTHS
HAD GONE BY--

08:51.364 --> 08:55.235
I THOUGHT
MAYBE WE WERE READY.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.004
I KNEW HE WAS SEEING
SOMEONE ELSE.

08:57.104 --> 09:01.809
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE
DINNER, CATCH UP.

09:01.909 --> 09:04.678
HE ALWAYS
MAKES ME FEEL--

09:06.213 --> 09:08.716
I DON'T KNOW.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.851
HE'S OLDER.

09:10.951 --> 09:14.054
HE KNOWS HOW TO
TAKE CARE OF THINGS,

09:14.154 --> 09:17.190
HOW TO KEEP EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.360
SO I SENT HIM AN EMAIL.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.463
I SAID I WAS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH ONE OF MY MODELS--

09:23.563 --> 09:26.333
WHICH I WAS.
HE CAME RIGHT OVER.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.971
HE COULD SEE IMMEDIATELY
THAT I WAS TIRED.

09:32.472 --> 09:36.610
HE MADE ME RISOTTO
AND HE BROUGHT WINE.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.713
AND I REMEMBER THINKING,

09:41.014 --> 09:43.684
"THIS IS NICE.
WE CAN BE FRIENDS.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.119
WE ARE FRIENDS."

09:47.688 --> 09:49.690
AS HE WAS LEAVING,

09:49.790 --> 09:53.393
HE KISSED ME.

09:53.493 --> 09:56.830
AND I REMEMBER FEELING
CONFUSED, BUT...

09:58.331 --> 10:01.601
IT WAS LIKE IT TOOK
A LITTLE WHILE
FOR MY BRAIN

10:01.702 --> 10:03.671
TO CATCH UP WITH WHAT
MY BODY WAS DOING,

10:03.771 --> 10:06.874
WHERE MY HANDS
WERE GOING.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.376
AND I HEARD
THIS SOUND,

10:09.476 --> 10:11.378
LIKE A MOAN,

10:11.478 --> 10:13.513
AND I THOUGHT,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.348
"WHO MADE THAT SOUND?"

10:15.448 --> 10:18.185
AND THEN I REALIZED
IT WAS ME.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.223
WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING

10:24.692 --> 10:26.694
I STARTED TO CRY,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.030
AND THEN
HE STARTED TO CRY.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.834
I'D NEVER SEEN
HIM CRY BEFORE.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.470
WHEN IT WAS OVER
I SAID,

10:37.570 --> 10:39.707
"I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU."

10:39.807 --> 10:42.776
HE SAID, "I HAVE
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU."

10:42.876 --> 10:44.644
AND I SAID,
"YOU GO FIRST."

10:44.745 --> 10:47.380
AND SO HE SAID,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.649
"I'M ENGAGED."

10:49.750 --> 10:51.752
AND THEN I SAID,

10:51.852 --> 10:53.887
"I HAVE CANCER."

11:05.365 --> 11:07.200
THAT'S SO PAINFUL.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.809
( phone ringing )

11:19.012 --> 11:22.850
IT'S HIM.
IT'S KYLE.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.488
- I'M GOING TO
IGNORE THIS, OKAY?
- MMM.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.190
( phone beeps )

11:30.290 --> 11:32.392
( exhales sharply )

11:32.492 --> 11:34.361
- I'M SORRY.
- FOR WHAT?

11:34.461 --> 11:38.165
HE MUST'VE GOTTEN
YOUR NUMBER FROM
THE ICE QUEEN'S PHONE.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.801
SHE MUST'VE TOLD HIM
WHAT HAPPENED.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.237
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

11:46.439 --> 11:48.675
I EXPECTED HER
TO TELL HIM

11:48.776 --> 11:52.279
AND I'M GLAD
THAT HE CALLED.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.214
DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT
BE PART OF THE REASON

11:54.314 --> 11:57.584
THAT YOU WERE
SO ANXIOUS TO CALL HER?

11:57.684 --> 12:00.720
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
HER TO CONVEY

12:00.821 --> 12:04.257
YOUR ANGER TO HIM?

12:04.357 --> 12:08.195
I DON'T NEED
TO GO THROUGH HER
TO GET TO HIM, CLEARLY.

12:08.295 --> 12:11.431
MM-HMM. HAVE YOU SEEN
KYLE SINCE THAT NIGHT?

12:11.531 --> 12:13.867
NO, I KICKED HIM OUT

12:13.967 --> 12:16.103
AND TOLD HIM
I NEVER WANTED
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.271
BECAUSE--

12:18.371 --> 12:20.607
BECAUSE HE TOLD YOU
HE WAS ENGAGED?

12:20.707 --> 12:23.110
BECAUSE HE WAS
MEAN TO ME.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.446
( sighs )
AFTER I TOLD HIM
I HAD CANCER,

12:26.546 --> 12:30.717
HE GOT REALLY ANXIOUS
AND ASKED ME WHAT
MY PLAN WAS.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.685
I TOLD HIM
I DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN

12:32.786 --> 12:36.423
AND HE GOT ANGRY
AND ACCUSED ME OF NOT
TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.425
HE GOT ANGRY?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.693
HIS DAD...

12:40.794 --> 12:43.196
WAS PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE
TO HIS MOM,

12:43.296 --> 12:45.899
AND SHE WOULDN'T
DEFEND HERSELF.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.769
SO WHEN KYLE SEES
WOMEN NOT TAKING CARE
OF THEMSELVES,

12:49.870 --> 12:51.471
HE GOES APESHIT.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.475
- APRIL, DO YOU THINK THAT--
- AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA SAY NEXT.

12:55.575 --> 12:59.079
"GEE, APRIL,
DO YOU THINK YOU TRIED
TO PROVOKE KYLE

12:59.179 --> 13:01.348
WITH YOUR APATHY
IN ORDER TO GET A REACTION

13:01.448 --> 13:03.716
AND SEE HOW MUCH
HE CARES ABOUT YOU?"
AND THE ANSWER IS NO,

13:03.817 --> 13:06.019
I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT
TO TELL HIM.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.322
IT JUST--
IT SLIPPED OUT.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.458
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO SAY NEXT?

13:14.828 --> 13:16.163
I'M SORRY.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.066
ACTUALLY,
I THINK IT'S GREAT

13:19.166 --> 13:21.568
THAT YOU SEE THINGS
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.570
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.438
IT'S REALLY HELPFUL.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.908
( chuckles )
YEAH, RIGHT.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.980
DO YOU FIND
IT HARD TO LET YOURSELF
BE TAKEN CARE OF?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.315
IT FEELS TO ME LIKE

13:35.415 --> 13:39.186
YOU NOT ONLY WANT
TO DO YOUR OWN WORK HERE,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.721
BUT YOU WANT
TO DO MINE AS WELL.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.657
THAT WAY YOU BELIEVE
YOU CAN GET THROUGH THIS

13:44.757 --> 13:47.094
WITHOUT-- WITHOUT ME.

13:48.962 --> 13:53.166
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU MENTIONED

13:53.266 --> 13:55.602
KYLE HERE FIRST,

13:55.702 --> 13:58.105
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.107
YOU SOUND
LIKE MY FATHER.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.343
YES, I GUESS
I DO REACT IN THAT WAY.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.678
YOU SAID THAT
HE WAS OLDER, THAT HE HAD
A WEALTHY GIRLFRIEND,

14:05.778 --> 14:08.348
- YET HE SLEPT WITH YOU.
- YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM FOR THAT.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.517
I'M TELLING YOU,
WE HAVE THIS THING--

14:10.617 --> 14:14.854
I'M NOT
BLAMING HIM, APRIL.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.789
ACTUALLY, OVER THE SESSION,
I THINK I'M BEGINNING

14:16.890 --> 14:19.092
TO UNDERSTAND
HIS BEHAVIOR.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.462
- WHY?
- BECAUSE I THINK
I KNOW HOW HE FEELS.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.135
YOU DESCRIBED
THE WAY HE RESPONDED
TO YOUR REVELATION--

14:28.235 --> 14:30.470
TO YOUR CANCER--
AS BEING MEAN,

14:30.570 --> 14:34.274
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT HE WAS BEHAVING
APPROPRIATELY--

14:34.374 --> 14:36.409
ANXIOUSLY.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.847
YOU KNOW,
IN THE LAST SESSION
THAT WE HAD

14:40.948 --> 14:42.515
YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU HAD CANCER,

14:42.615 --> 14:45.318
AND AS SOON AS YOU DID THAT
YOU STARTED TO PUSH ME AWAY.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.325
THE LESS LIKELY I WAS
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.027
YOU CALLED ME, LIKE,
10 TIMES THIS WEEK.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.963
YOU MUST'VE NEVER
WANTED TO SEE ME AGAIN.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.065
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU TOLD KYLE

14:58.165 --> 15:00.100
AND THEN YOU STARTED
TO PUSH HIM AWAY.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.935
YOU VILIFIED
HIS BEHAVIOR.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.937
BUT HE CAN'T
HELP ME ANYMORE.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.573
HE DOESN'T BELONG TO ME.
HE ISN'T MINE.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.242
SO BECAUSE HE'S NOT
YOUR PARTNER, HE CAN'T
HELP YOU ANYMORE?

15:09.342 --> 15:11.478
IT'S ALL OR NOTHING WITH ME.
IT'S JUST THE WAY I'M BUILT.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.751
HE DIDN'T HURT ME.

15:18.851 --> 15:22.990
I HURT HIM.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.924
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT
WE BROKE UP.
IT WAS MINE.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.726
I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.129
WELL, WHAT--
WHAT COULDN'T YOU TAKE?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.332
HOW MUCH
HE LOVED ME.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.334
WHY?

15:36.836 --> 15:40.173
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

15:45.845 --> 15:49.249
YOU SAID THAT
YOU COULDN'T RELY ON KYLE

15:49.349 --> 15:53.586
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
BELONG TO YOU.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.925
IS THERE ANYONE
IN YOUR LIFE WHO DOES?

15:59.026 --> 16:01.161
RIGHT NOW?

16:02.762 --> 16:04.931
DANIEL.

16:05.032 --> 16:09.269
SO YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
HAVE A DEEP BOND.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.970
YEAH.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.606
DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT THE CANCER?

16:17.010 --> 16:19.612
DANIEL HAS ENOUGH
TO WORRY ABOUT.

16:19.712 --> 16:23.483
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE NEGOTIATING
THE WORLD, PAUL.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.785
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN
ANYONE WITH AUTISM?

16:25.885 --> 16:27.320
MM-HMM.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.890
WHAT'S THAT
BEEN LIKE FOR YOU?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.925
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.529
IT'S-- EVERY SECOND
OF EVERY DAY

16:36.629 --> 16:39.899
IT IS LIKE HE IS
IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHERE
HE DOESN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE

16:39.999 --> 16:43.336
AND WHERE
EVERYONE HATES HIM.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.607
HE'S LUCKY TO HAVE
SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS HIM

16:47.707 --> 16:49.442
AS WELL AS YOU DO.

16:49.542 --> 16:53.746
YEAH, WELL,
HE DIDN'T DESERVE
WHAT HE GOT.

16:56.183 --> 16:59.452
WELL, DO ANY OF US
DESERVE WHAT WE GET?

17:06.259 --> 17:08.495
WHEN KYLE
AND I WERE TOGETHER--

17:10.029 --> 17:12.565
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN,
BUT IT'S LIKE I WOULD

17:13.866 --> 17:17.204
JUST CHECK OUT SOMETIMES,

17:17.304 --> 17:20.740
BUT I WOULDN'T
GO FAR. I--

17:22.109 --> 17:24.111
I WOULD BE
WATCHING MYSELF,

17:24.211 --> 17:26.513
WATCHING KYLE--

17:26.613 --> 17:29.382
BRUSHING OUR TEETH,
MAKING COFFEE.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.486
AND I REMEMBER THINKING,

17:33.586 --> 17:36.389
"THIS IS WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE DANIEL."

17:37.524 --> 17:39.659
HOW OFTEN
WOULD THIS HAPPEN?

17:39.759 --> 17:41.594
A LOT...

17:43.396 --> 17:46.299
ESPECIALLY WHEN
WE WERE IN BED.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.170
SOMETIMES
WE'D BE HAVING SEX

17:50.270 --> 17:54.574
AND THEN
SUDDENLY I'D BE

17:54.674 --> 17:58.077
FLOATING ABOVE US,
LOOKING DOWN AND THINKING

17:58.178 --> 18:01.748
"OH, THEY'RE IN LOVE.
THAT'S NICE."

18:06.386 --> 18:10.323
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
THIS LAST TIME.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.293
I TRIED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN,
BUT I COULDN'T.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.364
I THINK THAT'S WHEN
I STARTED TO CRY.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.702
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU WERE

18:22.802 --> 18:26.105
WHAT WE CALL
DISSOCIATING.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.208
IT'S A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.477
IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE
OUTSIDE YOUR BODY,

18:30.577 --> 18:33.180
BUT WE DO IT SOMETIMES
TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING

18:33.280 --> 18:37.417
THAT WE FEEL IS
FRIGHTENING.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.854
WHAT WAS I AFRAID OF?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.694
THAT'S A VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.346
I SLEPT WITH
HIS BEST FRIEND--

19:07.880 --> 19:09.482
KYLE'S.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.419
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DID IT.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.488
THE WHOLE TIME
THERE WAS THIS VOICE
IN MY HEAD SAYING,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.192
"DON'T DO THIS.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.361
APRIL, PLEASE.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.264
YOU'RE GONNA SCREW
EVERYTHING UP.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.766
HE WON'T FORGIVE YOU."

19:27.934 --> 19:29.836
I DID IT ANYWAY

19:33.005 --> 19:35.074
AND THEN I TOLD HIM.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.444
AND I WAS RIGHT--

19:37.544 --> 19:41.448
HE COULDN'T FORGIVE ME.

19:41.548 --> 19:45.017
EVERYTHING WAS REALLY
SORT OF PERFECT.

19:45.117 --> 19:49.088
I WAS THIS
PERFECT GIRL TO HIM.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.525
DID THAT FEEL SCARY?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.662
NOW I'M...

19:56.896 --> 19:58.765
THAT GIRL,

19:58.865 --> 20:02.735
THE ONE WHO'S STILL
HUNG UP ON HER EX.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.373
I HATE GIRLS
LIKE THIS.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.077
YOU DON'T LIKE
TO SEE YOURSELF

20:11.177 --> 20:14.481
AS FLAWED, DO YOU?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.951
KYLE OFFERED TO TAKE ME
TO THE HOSPITAL

20:19.051 --> 20:21.020
TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST,

20:21.120 --> 20:22.855
SCHEDULE MY TREATMENTS,

20:22.955 --> 20:25.292
AND I ALMOST--

20:26.426 --> 20:29.796
I ALMOST LET HIM
DO IT, BECAUSE I--

20:31.163 --> 20:34.267
I WANTED TO SEE HIM
AGAIN SO BADLY.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.269
ISN'T THAT HORRIBLE?

20:36.369 --> 20:38.938
WHAT'S SO HORRIBLE
ABOUT THAT?

20:39.038 --> 20:41.441
I STOPPED MYSELF.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.314
HE'S BEEN CALLING EVERY DAY
SINCE WE SAW EACH OTHER,

20:47.414 --> 20:49.716
LIKE FIVE TIMES A DAY.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.419
I'M NOT PICKING UP.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.087
YOU ARE GONNA
NEED SOMEBODY

20:55.187 --> 20:57.590
TO TAKE YOU
TO CHEMOTHERAPY.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.863
FROM WHAT
I UNDERSTAND,

21:03.963 --> 21:06.899
YOU FEEL
VERY TIRED AFTERWARDS.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.138
I'VE BEEN FEELING
MUCH BETTER LATELY.

21:12.238 --> 21:15.442
I GIVE YOU CREDIT.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.745
APRIL, WOULD YOU
RATHER DIE THAN BE WEAK?

21:20.279 --> 21:24.116
IT IS VERY RARE
FOR THIS DISEASE

21:24.216 --> 21:27.720
TO GO AWAY
OF ITS OWN ACCORD.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.093
BASICALLY,
THAT'S UNHEARD OF.

21:34.193 --> 21:38.698
WELL, I HAVE
BEEN FEELING BETTER
SINCE COMING HERE.

21:41.534 --> 21:45.638
DID YOU EVER HAVE A--
WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD,

21:45.738 --> 21:47.374
DID YOU EVER HAVE
A WORRY DOLL?

21:47.474 --> 21:50.242
- A WHAT?
- A WORRY DOLL.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.345
YOU TELL IT
YOUR TROUBLES

21:52.445 --> 21:54.847
AND IT TAKES
YOUR TROUBLES AWAY.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.516
MAYBE--

21:56.616 --> 21:59.352
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK YOU HAVE IN ME.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.721
YOU'VE TOLD ME
YOU HAVE CANCER

22:01.821 --> 22:04.457
AND NOW
I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.093
NOW SINCE SOMEBODY ELSE
IS WORRYING,

22:07.193 --> 22:09.362
YOU DON'T NEED TO.

22:09.462 --> 22:13.065
AND SINCE YOU DON'T
NEED TO WORRY,

22:13.165 --> 22:15.602
YOU MUSTN'T HAVE CANCER.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.272
I HAVE TO TELL YOU:

22:20.373 --> 22:23.175
TALKING ABOUT THIS
TO A PSYCHOLOGIST

22:23.275 --> 22:24.977
IS NOT GONNA
MAKE IT GO AWAY.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.849
YOU KNOW, I--

22:31.618 --> 22:33.820
I SPOKE WITH
THIS FRIEND OF MINE
WHO'S AN ONCOLOGIST.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.723
- YOU DID WHAT?
- BASICALLY, APRIL,

22:36.823 --> 22:40.427
HE THINKS THAT YOUR
DELAYING CHEMOTHERAPY IS
A SENTENCE OF DEATH.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.094
YOU TALKED TO
SOMEONE ELSE ABOUT ME?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.564
- I DIDN'T MENTION YOUR NAME.
- YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO DO THAT.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.466
I CAME TO YOU
IN CONFIDENCE.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.868
IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN PROFESSIONALLY
NEGLIGENT OF ME

22:48.968 --> 22:50.670
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.842
I NEEDED TO FIND OUT
WHETHER YOUR BEHAVIOR

22:55.942 --> 22:58.077
- MIGHT BE SUICIDAL.
- SUICIDAL?!

22:58.177 --> 22:59.912
WHAT WOULD YOU
TELL ME TO DO, APRIL?

23:00.012 --> 23:03.683
YOU'VE BEEN TELLING
ME WHAT TO DO AND SAY
THROUGHOUT THIS SESSION.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.755
I CANNOT LET YOU...

23:12.792 --> 23:16.362
IT IS MY DUTY,
MY PROFESSIONAL DUTY,

23:16.463 --> 23:19.098
TO PROTECT YOU, APRIL,
FROM SELF-HARM.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.217
I WANT YOU
TO PROMISE ME

23:38.317 --> 23:41.120
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN,

23:42.489 --> 23:44.524
THAT NO MATTER
WHAT I DECIDE TO DO

23:44.624 --> 23:46.493
YOU WON'T TALK
TO ANYBODY ELSE

23:46.593 --> 23:48.828
ABOUT ME
OUTSIDE THIS ROOM.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.731
OKAY.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.168
I PROMISE.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.875
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
ME SOMETHING IN RETURN.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.511
WHAT?

24:04.611 --> 24:06.913
THAT IF YOU DECIDE
TO STOP THERAPY,

24:07.013 --> 24:08.715
YOU HAVE TO CALL ME.

24:08.815 --> 24:12.151
YOU CANNOT SEVER TIES
UNILATERALLY.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.887
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DISAPPEAR.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.829
I PROMISE.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.632
OKAY.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.637
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.176
( theme music playing )
