WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:03.759
lts trajectory is erratic.

00:03.836 --> 00:06.635
And our sensors aren't detecting
any stellar or planetary

00:06.705 --> 00:08.970
gravitational fields that could
account for its motion.

00:09.042 --> 00:11.203
Then you're saying
it isn't a comet.

00:11.277 --> 00:15.407
And yet, it looks, feels and
tastes just like a comet.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.143
Well, there's a slight chance

00:17.217 --> 00:20.118
there are magnetodynamic forces
acting on the comet

00:20.186 --> 00:22.746
that are too subtle
for our sensors to detect.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.987
Or it might be something
we've never encountered before.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.890
B'Elanna, go down
to Transporter Room 2.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.192
Let's beam aboard a sample
for examination.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.662
Aye, Captain.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.200
Harry, see if you
can lock onto a core fragment.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.963
Having no trouble penetrating
the crust, Captain.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.303
Janeway to Torres.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.274
We're ready when you are,
Lieutenant.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.777
Setting up a class-3
containment field, Captain.

00:45.845 --> 00:47.244
Field in place.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.837
Commence transport.

00:48.915 --> 00:50.075
Energizing.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.296 --> 01:04.923
Hello.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.727
My name is Q.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.477
Torres to Janeway.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.445
You'd better get down here,
Captain.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.673
Problem, Lieutenant?

03:01.748 --> 03:02.680
Yes, ma'am.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.683
That transport from the comet--

03:04.751 --> 03:05.843
it brought a man aboard.

03:05.919 --> 03:09.150
He says his name is Q.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.656
Red Alert.
l'll be right down.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.384
Oh, please don't bother,
Captain.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.326
Let me take you
to lunch instead.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.929
What a pleasure
it is to meet you.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.332
Oh, am l doing this right?

03:25.405 --> 03:28.738
lt's been so long since l've had
the opportunity to greet anyone.

03:28.808 --> 03:31.572
Oh, uh... here.
Take a seat.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.669
Allow me to make the
setting more appropriate.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.842
My name is Kathryn Janeway

03:37.917 --> 03:38.884
Captain of the Federation...

03:38.952 --> 03:40.613
Federation Starship Voyager.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.279
Yes, yes.
l know all that.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.721
Look-- Welsh rabbit

03:44.791 --> 03:46.622
like your grandfather
used to make.

03:46.693 --> 03:50.094
Rabbit? She never told me
she likes rabbits.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.427
What is a rabbit, anyway?

03:52.498 --> 03:53.988
ls this some new chef
she's interviewing?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.329
Please, eat.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.369
lt's the least l can do
to express my appreciation.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.371
Appreciation for what?

03:59.439 --> 04:01.339
For letting me out
of my captivity.

04:01.407 --> 04:05.207
You were being held
against your will

04:05.278 --> 04:06.370
inside the comet?

04:06.446 --> 04:08.346
ln a manner of speaking.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.780
And you...

04:10.850 --> 04:13.114
all of you...

04:13.186 --> 04:16.485
you're mortals, aren't you?

04:16.555 --> 04:18.649
Who was holding you prisoner?

04:20.293 --> 04:22.284
And you...

04:22.362 --> 04:25.820
only live for nine years.

04:25.898 --> 04:26.922
That's right.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.161
Oh, how l envy you.

04:29.235 --> 04:30.532
Why is that?

04:30.603 --> 04:34.664
Because the one thing
l want more than any other

04:34.741 --> 04:36.902
is to die.

04:36.976 --> 04:40.377
Look... l don't know
what you want here,

04:40.446 --> 04:42.676
but l know who you are.

04:42.749 --> 04:43.773
Every Captain in Starfleet

04:43.850 --> 04:45.317
has been briefed
about your appearances

04:45.385 --> 04:46.784
on the Enterprise,
and l'm warning...

04:46.853 --> 04:49.481
My... my appearances?

04:49.555 --> 04:53.218
Oh, you've mistaken me for...

04:53.293 --> 04:56.228
Oh, well, no matter.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.093
l really must get on
with my business

04:58.164 --> 05:00.394
before the others
realize l'm here.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.169
When someone
asks you about me,

05:05.238 --> 05:08.503
and they will,
would you tell them l said...

05:08.574 --> 05:10.041
You know, l've had 300 years

05:10.109 --> 05:12.043
to think of appropriate
last words.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.773
l wanted something... memorable,

05:14.847 --> 05:16.644
you know?
Quotable.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.282
Would you tell them l said,

05:21.354 --> 05:24.482
''l die not for myself

05:24.557 --> 05:26.218
but for you.''

05:29.028 --> 05:30.154
l know.

05:30.229 --> 05:31.787
l... l know.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.798
Enigmatic, provocative.

05:33.866 --> 05:36.130
They'll understand.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.069
Well... good-bye to you all.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.265
Many thanks.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.037
Here's the end of me.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.413
Oh... dear.
That's not right.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.815
Torres to Janeway.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.352
All the men have disappeared.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.478
l'm aware of it, Lieutenant.

05:55.555 --> 05:56.886
Report to the Bridge.
Janeway out.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.583
Bring them back now.

05:58.658 --> 06:01.024
Oh, oh. Of course, of course.

06:04.163 --> 06:06.791
l'm... a little out of practice.

06:13.973 --> 06:16.908
Well... that's that,
l'm afraid-- they're gone.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.670
Gone? Where?

06:18.745 --> 06:21.509
Just... gone.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.048
Oh, l apologize

06:23.116 --> 06:24.515
for the inconvenience.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.749
Well, good luck to you all.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.256
l really have to be going now.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.623
Return my crew.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.286
l...

06:36.362 --> 06:38.523
l'm not sure how.

06:38.598 --> 06:42.034
Humans...

06:42.101 --> 06:44.569
humans...

06:44.637 --> 06:48.164
Who would have more recent
experience with humans?

06:50.910 --> 06:53.174
What have you done now, Q?

07:03.890 --> 07:06.085
Well, now, isn't this just fine.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.786
Humans aren't supposed
to be in this Quadrant

07:07.860 --> 07:09.157
for another hundred years.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.662
l didn't bring them here.
Nothing to do with me.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.756
How did you get out, Q?

07:13.833 --> 07:15.232
l'm afraid
we're responsible for that.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.735
Oh, well, l guess that's what
we get for having a woman

07:17.804 --> 07:18.862
in the Captain's seat.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.233
You know, l was betting

07:20.306 --> 07:22.365
that Riker would
get this command.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.741
May l assume you're the Q
l've heard so much about?

07:25.812 --> 07:28.042
Have you heard about little me?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.308
Oh, do tell.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.579
Has Jean-Luc been whispering
about me behind my back?

07:34.654 --> 07:37.384
Say, is this a ship
of the Valkyries

07:37.457 --> 07:38.788
or have you human women

07:38.858 --> 07:42.021
finally done away
with your men altogether?

07:42.094 --> 07:43.686
There was a slight accident.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.128
A slight accident?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.790
Oh, let me guess.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.561
You were trying
to commit suicide.

07:50.102 --> 07:51.729
Now you see why
we've locked him up

07:51.804 --> 07:52.930
for the last 300 years.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.847
Facial art!

08:02.915 --> 08:05.383
Ooh, how very wilderness of you.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.078
Captain?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.849
All right, Q,
we should be going.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.184
l'm not leaving.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.851
Captain Janeway,
l demand asylum.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.393
This is a joke.

08:15.461 --> 08:16.621
No, it isn't.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.994
l am officially asking you,
Captain, to grant me asylum

08:19.065 --> 08:22.557
and give me protection
from my enemies, which is him.

08:22.635 --> 08:26.002
You would ask these puny humans
to protect you from me?

08:26.072 --> 08:27.334
Fat chance.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.034
What did you do to him?

08:30.109 --> 08:31.576
Nothing.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.578
He's still there
in the 24th century.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.842
l just took the rest of us
to an old hiding place of mine.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.539
Report.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.679
Captain, there are
no stars outside.

08:42.755 --> 08:44.382
Well, that's partially accurate.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.357
Actually, there's no universe
outside.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.655
On screen.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.252
Commander?

08:50.329 --> 08:54.493
l'm showing a large buildup
of baryonic particles.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.933
Perfectly normal.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.468
Captain, based on our readings,

08:58.538 --> 09:00.506
it appears we've been
transported back in time

09:00.573 --> 09:01.972
to the birth of the universe.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.035
Very old hiding place.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.172
Oh, l know all
the hiding places, Q.

09:09.248 --> 09:13.344
l hid here from the Continuum
myself once.

09:13.419 --> 09:16.183
This ship will not survive
the formation of the cosmos.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.587
Yes, but just think of the honor
of having your DNA spread

09:18.658 --> 09:20.626
from one corner
of the universe to the other.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.958
Why, you could be the origin
of the humanoid form.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.794
Q-- either Q--
get us out of here.

09:26.866 --> 09:29.562
You heard the lady, Q--
back to your cell.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.270
We're under attack.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.398
By a ship?

09:35.474 --> 09:38.034
By... by...

09:38.110 --> 09:39.907
l'm not sure what they are.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.381
Captain, l don't believe this,

09:43.449 --> 09:47.510
but according to my readings,
we're being attacked by protons.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.782
We've been reduced
to subatomic proportions.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.254
He'll never find us here.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.319
Mr. Tuvok,
see if you can release

09:54.393 --> 09:56.759
a positive ion charge
to repel them.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.958
Ready or not, here l am.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.830
Now what?

10:02.902 --> 10:04.426
Checking.

10:04.503 --> 10:08.337
We seem to be tethered
to some kind of large...

10:08.407 --> 10:09.704
plant.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.671
Let's see it.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.876
Computer, l need a wider angle.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.696
You can't hide from me, Q.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.630
And you can't take me by force.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.168
l'll stalemate you for eternity
if l have to.

10:37.236 --> 10:38.863
The hell you will.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.997
The vaunted Q Continuum--

10:41.107 --> 10:43.803
self-anointed guardians
of the universe.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.241
How dare you come
aboard this ship

10:45.311 --> 10:48.041
and endanger this crew
with your personal tug-of-war?

10:48.147 --> 10:51.207
Did anyone ever tell you you're
angry when you're beautiful?

10:53.386 --> 10:55.047
We're back where we
started from, Captain.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.053
Doesn't matter.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.487
l'm not going back
into that cell.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.046
How would you like
to spend eternity

10:59.125 --> 11:00.990
as a Gorokian midwife toad?

11:01.060 --> 11:03.654
Oh, just try it.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.924
Stop.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.863
You want asylum?

11:07.933 --> 11:09.594
Fine.
We'll have a hearing.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.261
A hearing!

11:11.337 --> 11:15.171
You would have me put his future
into your delicate little hands?

11:15.241 --> 11:18.108
Oh, so touchably soft.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.872
What is your secret, dear?

11:19.945 --> 11:23.278
When the Captain
of a Starfleet vessel receives

11:23.349 --> 11:25.909
an official request for asylum,
there is a clear

11:25.985 --> 11:26.974
procedure to follow.

11:27.053 --> 11:30.716
l suggest, to end your deadlock
and to save my ship,

11:30.790 --> 11:33.224
that we follow it to the letter.

11:33.292 --> 11:36.489
Well, this could go on for
a millennium or two, l suppose.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.190
All right, l accept
on behalf of the Continuum

11:39.265 --> 11:40.994
on one condition--

11:41.067 --> 11:42.364
if you rule in our favor,

11:42.435 --> 11:45.097
Q agrees to return
to his confinement.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.695
l have a condition of my own.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.740
lf you rule in my favor,

11:48.808 --> 11:52.244
then the Continuum
must grant me mortality.

11:52.311 --> 11:53.778
Why?
So you can kill yourself?

11:53.846 --> 11:54.710
Exactly.

11:54.780 --> 11:55.678
Accepted.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.579
Well, this is going to make
for an amusing diversion.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.712
Will you send him to prison
for eternity

12:02.822 --> 12:06.223
or will you assist
in his suicide plan?

12:06.258 --> 12:07.919
That's a toughie,

12:07.993 --> 12:10.393
but then again, that's why
they made you Captain, isn't it?

12:10.463 --> 12:12.727
To handle the real tough ones.

12:12.798 --> 12:15.892
My, my. Now l guess
we get to find out

12:15.968 --> 12:18.266
whether the pants...

12:18.337 --> 12:20.168
really fit.

12:27.646 --> 12:29.807
Am l interrupting anything?

12:29.882 --> 12:31.372
l am curious.

12:31.450 --> 12:33.850
Have the Q always had
an absence of manners,

12:33.919 --> 12:34.908
or is it the result

12:34.987 --> 12:37.114
of some natural
evolutionary process

12:37.189 --> 12:39.089
that comes with omnipotence?

12:39.158 --> 12:40.523
What?

12:40.593 --> 12:44.188
Oh, you mean just popping in
whenever we feel like it?

12:44.263 --> 12:46.959
That is one relevant example.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.557
l apologize.
At some point along the way,

12:49.635 --> 12:52.866
l guess we just stopped thinking
about the little niceties.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.303
So it seems.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.739
But you mustn't
think of us as omnipotent,

12:56.809 --> 12:59.835
no matter what the Continuum
would like you to believe.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.743
You and your ship seem
incredibly powerful

13:01.847 --> 13:03.474
to life-forms without
your technical expertise.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.450
lt's no different with us.

13:05.518 --> 13:10.251
We may appear omnipotent to you,
but believe me, we're not.

13:10.422 --> 13:11.411
lntriguing.

13:11.490 --> 13:14.357
Just what vulnerabilities
do the Q have?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.662
Always looking for the tactical
advantage, Mr. Tuvok.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.221
Very good.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.928
As a matter of fact,
that's why l've come to see you.

13:24.069 --> 13:28.403
ln a way, our vulnerability
is what this is all about.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.441
As the Q have evolved,

13:29.508 --> 13:31.476
we've sacrificed many things
along the way--

13:31.544 --> 13:35.981
not just manners, but mortality
and a sense of purpose

13:36.081 --> 13:39.642
and a desire for change
and a capacity to grow.

13:39.718 --> 13:43.779
Each loss is
a new vulnerability...

13:43.856 --> 13:45.756
wouldn't you say?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.452
Why are you telling me this?

13:47.526 --> 13:50.984
Because l want you
to represent me at the hearing.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.758
Me?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.925
l have no legal expertise.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.467
But l need someone
who understands

13:56.535 --> 13:58.662
Federation asylum practices.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.329
Besides...

14:00.406 --> 14:02.465
Vulcans approve of suicide.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.009
lt is true that Vulcans

14:05.077 --> 14:06.908
who reach a certain infirmity
with age

14:07.012 --> 14:08.912
do practice ritual suicides.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.915
Nevertheless, l fail to see

14:11.016 --> 14:12.210
how that fact
would be meaningful

14:12.284 --> 14:13.444
in this circumstance.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.050
l have the right to counsel,
Mr. Tuvok.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.886
Will you assist me?

14:30.135 --> 14:31.932
Let me begin by stating clearly

14:32.004 --> 14:34.404
that l expect all parties
to act appropriately

14:34.473 --> 14:36.703
and with respect
for these proceedings.

14:36.775 --> 14:39.107
l will not have this hearing
turned into a circus.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.338
ls that clear?

14:45.251 --> 14:46.411
ls that clear, Q?

14:46.485 --> 14:50.353
Madam Captain,
we are dealing here

14:50.422 --> 14:53.084
with an issue of the greatest
importance to the Q Continuum.

14:53.158 --> 14:56.252
l can assure you, we take
this matter very seriously.

14:56.328 --> 14:57.260
Thank you.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.126
And please don't call me
''Madam Captain.''

15:02.534 --> 15:04.058
Since you've made it clear

15:04.136 --> 15:06.331
that your asylum
would lead to suicide,

15:06.405 --> 15:08.532
you place me
in a difficult position.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.768
l understand, Captain.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.311
May l ask you
why you want to commit suicide?

15:13.379 --> 15:16.041
As difficult as it is
for you to imagine,

15:16.115 --> 15:18.015
for me, immortality
is impossible

15:18.083 --> 15:19.675
to endure any longer.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.912
ln the Continuum,

15:21.020 --> 15:22.544
an individual has an obligation

15:22.621 --> 15:25.749
to be responsible to the path
his life will follow.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.018
''His life will follow.''

15:27.092 --> 15:28.616
Emphasize life.

15:28.694 --> 15:32.425
l never yielded that obligation
to the Continuum.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.591
lf the path l choose
leads to death,

15:34.667 --> 15:36.567
what right have they
to interfere?

15:36.635 --> 15:38.159
He's putting his selfish wishes

15:38.237 --> 15:39.932
above the welfare
of everyone else.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.267
And if l don't agree
with the majority,

15:41.340 --> 15:43.934
l'm to be locked up
for eternity.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.043
You would not be confined

15:45.110 --> 15:47.977
if you were not intent
on harming yourself.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.605
With your permission, Captain,

15:49.682 --> 15:52.981
l would like to call
an expert on the Continuum

15:53.052 --> 15:56.544
to discuss the implications
of the decision to be made.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.611
Proceed.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.818
l call myself to the stand.

16:02.094 --> 16:03.391
Ta-da!

16:03.462 --> 16:04.554
Thank you for coming.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.530
lt's a rare honor

16:06.598 --> 16:09.431
to have someone of your
reputation and accomplishment

16:09.501 --> 16:10.433
with us today.

16:10.502 --> 16:11.867
Thank you.

16:12.004 --> 16:16.134
Tell me, what would be the
impact of a Q suicide?

16:16.208 --> 16:18.438
Oh, it would be an interruption
to the Continuum.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.910
lt would change the very nature
of Q.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.777
Can you be more specific?

16:22.848 --> 16:26.340
No, because we're not even sure
what the end result would be.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.410
His suicide could have all sorts
of unknown consequences

16:29.488 --> 16:30.546
for the Continuum.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.180
Precisely!

16:32.257 --> 16:35.124
lt would force the Q
to deal with the unknown

16:35.194 --> 16:37.628
for the first time
since the new era began.

16:37.696 --> 16:38.856
They're afraid of me

16:38.931 --> 16:42.492
because they're afraid
of the unknown.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.695
How would you characterize
his remarks?

16:44.770 --> 16:48.467
No Q has ever tried
to commit suicide.

16:48.540 --> 16:52.670
lmmortality is one of the
defining qualities of being a Q.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.077
By every measure
of the Continuum,

16:55.147 --> 16:57.775
his remarks would have
to be considered as...

16:57.850 --> 16:59.977
mentally unbalanced.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.317
Mentally unbalanced.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.753
And no civilized people
in the universe,

17:04.823 --> 17:07.290
including the primitive
Federation societies,

17:07.358 --> 17:12.296
would condone the suicide
of a mentally unbalanced person.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.231
Tell me, Q,

17:15.300 --> 17:17.825
can you offer any other evidence
of mental instability

17:17.903 --> 17:19.564
on the part of my client?

17:19.637 --> 17:21.070
What more do l need?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.868
He wants to kill himself.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.876
ln fact, until this issue arose,
he was known in the Continuum

17:25.944 --> 17:27.536
as one of your great
philosophers.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.376
-ls that not true?
-Not anymore it isn't.

17:29.448 --> 17:32.884
So your entire basis for
judging him mentally unbalanced

17:32.951 --> 17:35.010
is his wish to commit suicide.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.647
l submit
that is a faulty premise.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.157
ln many cultures,
suicide is acceptable

17:40.225 --> 17:42.750
and in and of itself
cannot be used as evidence

17:42.828 --> 17:45.296
of mental illness.

17:45.364 --> 17:48.356
l tend to agree with Mr. Tuvok.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.925
-Oh... Vulcans!
-Oh... Vulcans!

17:51.003 --> 17:53.062
lsn't it true that on occasion,

17:53.138 --> 17:55.834
the Continuum has executed Qs
for certain crimes?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.375
On rare occasions, yes.

17:57.443 --> 18:00.435
Didn't their deaths create an
interruption in the Continuum?

18:00.512 --> 18:01.706
Their crimes created
the interruption,

18:01.780 --> 18:02.712
their deaths ended it.

18:02.781 --> 18:04.305
l know where you're going
with this, Lieutenant.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.611
Do you?

18:05.684 --> 18:07.151
And it's not going to work.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.413
Our society, like any other,

18:08.487 --> 18:10.580
must control
its disruptive elements.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.090
An execution may be undesirable,
l grant you that,

18:13.158 --> 18:15.058
but on some rare occasions,

18:15.127 --> 18:17.755
it is necessary
and warranted, and a decision

18:17.830 --> 18:20.264
to proceed is made
only after great deliberation

18:20.332 --> 18:22.061
by the entire Continuum.

18:22.134 --> 18:25.297
You cannot imagine the chaos
that would be created

18:25.370 --> 18:27.338
if individuals like Q here

18:27.406 --> 18:29.340
could choose between
life and death.

18:29.408 --> 18:32.400
This is a matter of social order
versus anarchy.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.470
l understand.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.107
And you find
nothing contradictory

18:38.183 --> 18:40.651
in a society
that outlaws suicide

18:40.719 --> 18:43.187
but practices
capital punishment?

18:45.357 --> 18:46.847
No.

18:46.925 --> 18:48.790
Any other questions, Lieutenant?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.462
Just one other thing.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.935
lsn't it true that you yourself

18:59.071 --> 19:01.039
were once accused
of being mentally unstable

19:01.140 --> 19:02.107
by the Continuum?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.541
Were you not disciplined
for inappropriate behavior?

19:04.610 --> 19:05.542
Objection.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.511
l'll allow the question.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.146
My record has been expunged.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.979
l will take that as a yes.

19:13.051 --> 19:14.143
Thank you.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.777
That is all.

19:15.854 --> 19:17.344
You're excused.

19:18.557 --> 19:21.025
lf l may beg
the court's indulgence,

19:21.093 --> 19:22.560
l have other witnesses to call.

19:22.628 --> 19:24.095
To what end?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.357
Your Captain Honor,

19:25.430 --> 19:27.864
l am here to argue
for the majesty of life--

19:27.933 --> 19:29.696
what it means
for us to be alive.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.737
A Q's life takes him
to all corners of the universe.

19:32.804 --> 19:36.831
This Q's life has touched and
affected many, many others--

19:36.909 --> 19:39.070
including some
on your own homeworld.

19:39.144 --> 19:40.076
With your permission,

19:40.145 --> 19:42.045
l would like to call
some of those people

19:42.114 --> 19:45.015
whose lives have been
changed by this Q.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.711
You want to bring people here
from Earth?

19:47.786 --> 19:49.276
l promise
it won't impact the timeline,

19:49.354 --> 19:50.321
and no one will remember

19:50.389 --> 19:53.483
ever having been here
after l send them back.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.187
This is most unusual.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.252
Do you have any objection,
Mr. Tuvok?

19:58.330 --> 20:01.094
l am as curious
as you are, Captain.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.226
Very well.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.496
Proceed.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.843
Q!

20:11.910 --> 20:13.207
What the hell is going on?

20:13.278 --> 20:15.246
My apologies, Commander...

20:15.314 --> 20:16.781
To you all.

20:16.848 --> 20:19.544
My name is Kathryn Janeway.

20:19.618 --> 20:23.110
Captain Janeway,
the USS Voyager.

20:23.188 --> 20:25.588
That's correct, Commander.

20:25.657 --> 20:27.147
You're aboard Voyager.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.158
We're lost

20:28.227 --> 20:29.990
in the Delta Quadrant,
and as much as l wish

20:30.062 --> 20:31.791
you could tell them
that when you get home,

20:31.863 --> 20:34.957
your memories will be wiped
before you get back.

20:35.033 --> 20:37.001
God, if you let me
live through this,

20:37.102 --> 20:39.662
l promise l'll clean
up my act-- l swear.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.330
l demand an explanation!

20:41.406 --> 20:43.704
Why are you dressed
like this, young man?

20:43.775 --> 20:45.834
Man, have you looked
in a mirror lately?

20:45.911 --> 20:47.845
Allow me to try to explain,
Mister...?

20:47.913 --> 20:48.902
Ginsberg.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.848
Maury Ginsberg.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.249
Sir lsaac Newton.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.308
William Riker.

20:55.387 --> 20:56.319
Nice to meet you.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.949
Consider for a moment
that it might be possible

21:00.025 --> 21:04.086
to travel forward in time--
say, to the 24th century--

21:04.196 --> 21:05.891
onto a starship...

21:05.931 --> 21:10.197
7 5,000 light-years from Earth.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.973
You're having
a very strange dream

21:18.076 --> 21:20.374
and in this dream,
you are seeing this man

21:20.445 --> 21:22.072
whom you've all met before.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.981
Yes, l have seen
that man before.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.984
You were sitting
under the tree the day...

21:27.052 --> 21:29.452
The day the apple
fell on your head.

21:29.521 --> 21:30.954
Yes, that's right.

21:31.023 --> 21:31.990
Quite a day, wasn't it?

21:32.057 --> 21:33.183
As a matter of fact,

21:33.258 --> 21:36.159
this man jostled the tree
when he got up to leave.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.628
Just before
the apple fell-- yes.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.928
And a new era in human
science was born.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.867
Wait a minute!
Weren't you the guy in the jeep?

21:46.271 --> 21:49.138
The ''guy in the jeep''

21:49.207 --> 21:51.505
who picked you up after
your own vehicle broke down

21:51.576 --> 21:52.543
that summer afternoon.

21:52.611 --> 21:53.578
lsn't that right?

21:53.645 --> 21:56.409
Oh, man, he was a lifesaver.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.142
My van died,
and they dragged it off the road

21:58.216 --> 21:59.240
because of all the traffic.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.285
lt was backed up for miles.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.945
You were on your way to a job,
weren't you?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.650
Yeah, l was supposed to be on
the follow spot up in Tower 3.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.191
l never
would have made it in time

22:07.259 --> 22:08.191
if it weren't for him.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.455
Hey, whatever happened
with that groovy chick

22:10.529 --> 22:12.554
with the long red beads
in the back seat?

22:12.631 --> 22:15.122
l've been looking for her
ever since you dropped me off.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.260
You'll see her again,
don't worry.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.304
To sum up, you were

22:19.371 --> 22:22.238
a spotlight operator at an
outdoor concert of some sort,

22:22.307 --> 22:23.774
a concert
that was put in jeopardy

22:23.842 --> 22:25.241
moments before it was to begin

22:25.310 --> 22:27.574
because the entire
sound system failed.

22:27.646 --> 22:28.738
Oh, it was no big deal.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.748
Somebody must have snagged
an extension cord

22:30.816 --> 22:32.750
with one of the trucks,
that's all.

22:32.818 --> 22:35.184
l'm just lucky l noticed it.

22:35.253 --> 22:38.279
Yes. Lucky you were at the right
place at the right time,

22:38.357 --> 22:40.154
or it would have taken days
to track down the problem

22:40.225 --> 22:41.453
and there would
have been no concert.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.994
Well, l'm sorry to say

22:44.062 --> 22:46.496
l have met him,
but l've never seen

22:46.565 --> 22:47.827
this man before in my life.

22:47.899 --> 22:48.957
Are you sure?

22:49.034 --> 22:50.501
Has it not been established

22:50.569 --> 22:53.197
that my client has been
in captivity during all

22:53.271 --> 22:54.465
of Commander Riker's lifetime?

22:54.539 --> 22:56.803
Have you seen
this photograph before?

22:59.978 --> 23:01.605
Sure l have.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.874
That is Colonel Thaddeus Riker

23:03.915 --> 23:05.906
after he was wounded
at Pine Mountain.

23:05.984 --> 23:08.145
They used to call him
''Old lron Boots.''

23:08.220 --> 23:10.518
He was in command
of the 102nd New York

23:10.589 --> 23:13.251
during General Sherman's
march on Atlanta.

23:13.325 --> 23:18.024
This picture was taken in 1864,
just after they let him out

23:18.096 --> 23:19.028
of the army hospital.

23:19.097 --> 23:20.428
And the soldier beside him?

23:24.636 --> 23:26.103
l'll be damned.

23:27.506 --> 23:28.473
lt's him.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.940
As a matter of fact,

23:31.009 --> 23:35.412
he carried your wounded ancestor
back from the front line...

23:35.480 --> 23:36.640
Didn't you?

23:41.353 --> 23:42.479
My point is, Captain,

23:42.554 --> 23:45.546
Q has had a profound influence
on these three lives.

23:45.624 --> 23:46.989
Without Q,

23:47.092 --> 23:49.253
lsaac Newton would
have died forgotten

23:49.327 --> 23:51.192
in a Liverpool debtor's prison--

23:51.263 --> 23:54.630
a suspect in several
prostitute murders.

23:54.699 --> 23:56.599
Without Q,

23:56.668 --> 23:59.262
there would have been
no concert at, uh...

23:59.337 --> 24:00.736
Woodstock.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.272
Wherever.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.501
More importantly,

24:03.575 --> 24:05.907
Mr. Ginsberg would never
have met his future wife

24:05.977 --> 24:08.775
''the groovy chick
with the long red beads''

24:08.847 --> 24:11.145
and he would never have become
a successful orthodontist,

24:11.216 --> 24:13.275
settled in Scarsdale
with four kids.

24:13.351 --> 24:14.909
Far out.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.578
Yes.

24:16.655 --> 24:19.920
Without Q, there would have been
no William T. Riker at all,

24:20.025 --> 24:20.923
and l would have lost

24:21.026 --> 24:22.926
at least a dozen
really good opportunities

24:22.994 --> 24:25.292
to insult him over the years.

24:25.363 --> 24:27.661
Oh, and lest l forget...

24:27.732 --> 24:31.532
without Q, the Borg would
have assimilated the Federation.

24:31.603 --> 24:34.834
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

24:36.575 --> 24:39.408
This is the life that Q
treats without respect.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.106
This is the life that he would
give up so easily.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.944
May l remind this hearing
and my learned colleague,

24:45.016 --> 24:46.779
that for the last
three centuries,

24:46.852 --> 24:49.980
my client has not been
allowed contact with anyone.

24:50.088 --> 24:52.454
At this time, we would
like to reproduce

24:52.524 --> 24:54.389
the environment in which
he has been confined.

24:54.459 --> 24:55.323
l object.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.384
No...

24:57.462 --> 24:59.327
l'll allow this.

25:06.972 --> 25:08.439
These are the conditions

25:08.507 --> 25:10.907
my client will be forced
to live in for eternity

25:10.976 --> 25:12.500
if you deny him asylum, Captain.

25:12.577 --> 25:15.478
We just want to give him time
to reconsider his position.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.674
l will never change my mind!

25:17.749 --> 25:18.681
This is your own doing.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.308
You could live
a perfectly normal life

25:20.385 --> 25:22.649
if you were simply willing
to live a perfectly normal life.

25:22.721 --> 25:23.688
l've seen enough.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.985
Please return us
to the hearing room.

25:28.093 --> 25:30.357
l would submit
that the quality of life

25:30.428 --> 25:32.157
my client will have to endure

25:32.230 --> 25:33.857
should be considered
in this proceeding.

25:33.932 --> 25:37.834
l don't like those conditions
any more than you do, Mr. Tuvok,

25:37.903 --> 25:40.667
and l wouldn't want
to spend another day there

25:40.739 --> 25:41.763
if l were you, Q...

25:41.840 --> 25:46.470
but l'm here to rule
on a request for asylum,

25:46.545 --> 25:49.946
not to judge the penal system
of the Q Continuum.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.346
And he does have a point--

25:52.417 --> 25:56.547
you were confined to prevent you
from doing harm to yourself.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.886
l've been doing
a great deal of research,

25:59.958 --> 26:02.654
studying a variety
of cultural attitudes on suicide

26:02.761 --> 26:05.093
to help me frame the basis
of a decision.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.597
Mr. Tuvok, are you familiar

26:06.665 --> 26:09.031
with the ''double effect''
principle on assisted suicide

26:09.100 --> 26:10.965
that dates back
to the Bolian middle ages?

26:11.036 --> 26:13.334
l believe it relates
to the relief of suffering,

26:13.405 --> 26:14.394
does it not, Captain?

26:14.472 --> 26:18.772
lt states, ''an action
that has the principle effect

26:18.843 --> 26:21.744
''of relieving suffering
may be ethically justified

26:21.813 --> 26:24.646
''even though the same action
has the secondary effect

26:24.716 --> 26:27.014
of possibly causing death.''

26:27.085 --> 26:29.918
This principle is the only thing
l can find

26:29.988 --> 26:33.924
that could possibly convince me
to decide in your favor, Q.

26:33.992 --> 26:35.619
And yet, as l look at you,

26:35.694 --> 26:37.491
you don't seem,
by our standards,

26:37.562 --> 26:41.089
aged, infirm or in any pain.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.726
Can you show this hearing
that you suffer

26:43.802 --> 26:45.497
in any manner
other than that caused

26:45.570 --> 26:47.902
by the conditions
of your incarceration?

26:47.973 --> 26:52.535
Any suffering that would justify
a decision to grant you asylum?

26:57.415 --> 26:59.212
May l request a recess

26:59.284 --> 27:01.514
to consider our response,
Captain?

27:04.122 --> 27:05.714
Granted.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.758
We're going to lose, aren't we?

27:07.826 --> 27:11.728
l would say we have not yet
convinced Captain Janeway

27:11.796 --> 27:13.991
of the validity
of our argument.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.795
You're doing a fine job,
Mr. Tuvok.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.564
lt's nice to know
someone believes in me.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.766
l am representing your position
to the best of my ability.

27:22.841 --> 27:26.004
lt is most definitely
not my own.

27:26.077 --> 27:28.511
l see no persuasive evidence

27:28.580 --> 27:30.377
that a life like yours
should be wasted

27:30.448 --> 27:32.609
simply because
you are disgruntled.

27:32.684 --> 27:35.710
Frankly, l see no logic
to your position.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.721
You...

27:37.789 --> 27:40.189
you surprise me, Mr. Tuvok,

27:40.258 --> 27:43.921
which is a rare and special gift
to a Q. Thank you.

27:44.029 --> 27:49.262
But may l say, if only you knew
what life as a Q were like,

27:49.334 --> 27:50.926
you would see the logic.

27:51.069 --> 27:55.267
Then perhaps what we should do
next is take this hearing

27:55.340 --> 27:57.865
to see life
in the Continuum itself.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.544
Captain's Log, supplemental.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.415
l'm determined
to find a better alternative

28:08.486 --> 28:10.511
to suicide or endless prison,

28:10.588 --> 28:14.024
so l've summoned the advocate Q
to make him a proposal.

28:14.092 --> 28:15.354
Yes, what is it, Captain?

28:15.427 --> 28:16.860
Come to the next session
of the hearing

28:16.928 --> 28:18.987
and announce
that the Continuum is ready

28:19.064 --> 28:21.464
to reintegrate Q
into your society--

28:21.533 --> 28:24.866
that you won't condemn him
to that cell for eternity.

28:24.969 --> 28:27.233
And you will rule in our favor?

28:27.305 --> 28:29.865
l would consider it
a very meaningful gesture

28:29.974 --> 28:31.407
by the Continuum.

28:31.476 --> 28:34.673
How would you know
if l intended to keep my word?

28:34.746 --> 28:38.910
Based on my research,
you have been many things--

28:38.983 --> 28:42.350
a rude, interfering,
inconsiderate, sadistic...

28:42.420 --> 28:43.352
You've made your point.

28:43.421 --> 28:44.752
...pest!

28:44.823 --> 28:45.881
And, oh, yes...

28:45.957 --> 28:49.393
you introduced us to the Borg--
thank you very much--

28:49.461 --> 28:52.919
but one thing you have
never been is a liar.

28:52.997 --> 28:57.798
l think you've uncovered
my one redeeming virtue.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.996
Am l blushing?

29:00.071 --> 29:03.666
l wish l could help you,
Kathy, l just can't.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.676
We're dealing here
with the most dangerous man

29:05.744 --> 29:06.676
in the Continuum.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.542
Now, l didn't tell you this,

29:08.613 --> 29:12.242
but one of his
self-destructive stunts

29:12.317 --> 29:13.341
created a misunderstanding

29:13.418 --> 29:15.682
which ignited the 100-year war

29:15.754 --> 29:18.154
between the Romulans
and the Vulcans.

29:18.223 --> 29:22.557
No. This man goes back
into his confinement,

29:22.627 --> 29:27.428
but... l would like to make it
easier for you.

29:27.499 --> 29:31.993
The Continuum is prepared
to do you a little favor...

29:33.538 --> 29:36.132
if we approve of your ruling.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.107
Look out the window.

29:52.524 --> 29:56.016
Now you see it, now you don't.

30:07.672 --> 30:09.640
We are prepared
to illustrate the nature

30:09.707 --> 30:11.106
of Q's suffering, Captain,

30:11.176 --> 30:13.644
but in order to do so,
we must show this hearing

30:13.711 --> 30:15.576
what life is like
in the Continuum.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.114
And how do you
intend to do that?

30:17.182 --> 30:20.379
By going to the Continuum
itself.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.282
ls this possible?

30:22.353 --> 30:23.411
No, it's a ridiculous idea.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.580
You would never understand.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.987
My client has the right to ask

30:26.090 --> 30:27.614
for an inspection
of the living conditions

30:27.692 --> 30:29.455
that lead to his suffering,
Captain.

30:29.527 --> 30:30.892
l would agree with that.

30:33.631 --> 30:34.928
l suppose you have
some crazy idea

30:34.999 --> 30:35.988
how to pull this off?

30:36.067 --> 30:37.034
Yes.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.831
Only if...

30:40.905 --> 30:42.236
Fine, fine.

30:43.775 --> 30:46.676
We've agreed on a format
for this little sojourn,

30:46.744 --> 30:48.974
but l still believe
it's ill-advised.

30:49.047 --> 30:51.447
l'll be the judge of that.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.118
Whenever you're ready.

30:56.654 --> 30:57.643
No, no.

31:02.794 --> 31:06.321
This is the Q Continuum--
a road in a desert?

31:06.397 --> 31:07.591
l told you so.

31:07.665 --> 31:10.099
This is a manifestation
of the Continuum

31:10.168 --> 31:13.262
that we hope falls within
your level of comprehension.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.465
This way.

31:55.947 --> 31:57.039
Good afternoon.

32:01.386 --> 32:04.321
l apologize for their lack
of hospitality, Captain.

32:04.389 --> 32:05.913
We're not used to visitors here.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.754
ln fact, you're the only ones
who've ever come.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.919
Then what is the purpose
of the road?

32:10.995 --> 32:12.257
The road...

32:12.330 --> 32:14.730
takes us to the rest
of the universe,

32:14.799 --> 32:16.528
then it leads back here...

32:16.601 --> 32:18.865
an endless circle.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.667
This was your existence
before your confinement?

32:21.739 --> 32:24.765
l traveled the road
many times...

32:24.842 --> 32:27.208
sat on the porch,
played the games...

32:27.278 --> 32:29.838
been the dog... everything.

32:29.914 --> 32:31.575
l was even the scarecrow
for a while.

32:31.649 --> 32:33.173
Why?

32:33.251 --> 32:35.719
Because l hadn't done it.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.312
Oh, we've all done
the scarecrow. Big deal!

32:38.389 --> 32:42.189
l can't say l entirely
understand what l'm seeing here,

32:42.260 --> 32:43.955
but these people
don't seem to be suffering.

32:44.028 --> 32:45.791
Well, of course not.
They're happy people!

32:45.863 --> 32:47.421
Happy people!

32:47.498 --> 32:49.363
What's there to feel sad about?

32:49.434 --> 32:50.799
Look at them.

32:52.937 --> 32:54.564
They don't dare feel sad.

32:54.639 --> 32:57.039
lf only they could,
that would be progress.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.042
Oh. The philosopher speaks.

32:59.110 --> 33:02.102
When l was
a respected philosopher,

33:02.213 --> 33:07.617
l celebrated the continuity,
the undeviation of Q life.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.678
l argued that our civilization
had achieved a purity

33:10.755 --> 33:13.485
that no other culture
had ever approached

33:13.558 --> 33:15.617
and it was wonderful...

33:15.693 --> 33:17.456
for a while.

33:17.528 --> 33:19.257
At the beginning of the new era,

33:19.330 --> 33:22.766
life as a Q was
a constant dialogue of discovery

33:22.834 --> 33:26.201
and issues and humor
from all over the universe,

33:26.270 --> 33:27.567
but look at them now.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.468
Listen to their dialogue now.

33:29.540 --> 33:31.337
l am afraid l cannot hear any.

33:31.409 --> 33:33.843
Because it has all been said.

33:33.911 --> 33:37.347
Everyone has heard everything,
seen everything.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.543
They haven't had to speak
to each other in ten millennia.

33:40.618 --> 33:43.212
There's nothing left to say.

33:43.287 --> 33:45.983
Well, l don't know about you,
but l appreciate a little peace

33:46.090 --> 33:47.682
and quiet now and again.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.125
lt's ironic, isn't it, Q?

33:50.194 --> 33:51.661
l don't know what you mean.

33:51.729 --> 33:52.821
Of course you do.

33:52.897 --> 33:54.125
That you, of all people,

33:54.198 --> 33:56.223
should be arguing their case.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.667
l believe in the ultimate
purity of the Q.

33:59.737 --> 34:02.501
You, who were banned
from the Continuum

34:02.607 --> 34:05.235
and made mortal
to pay for your crimes?

34:05.276 --> 34:06.675
My penance has ended.

34:06.744 --> 34:08.143
l'm a born-again Q.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.237
That life is behind me.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.804
What a shame...

34:12.884 --> 34:15.784
because, in many ways,
that life inspired me.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.753
lt did? l did?

34:17.822 --> 34:20.255
Oh, yes. You never knew that,
did you?

34:20.324 --> 34:22.315
You see, Captain,

34:22.393 --> 34:24.918
Q rebelled
against this existence

34:24.996 --> 34:27.226
by refusing to behave himself.

34:27.297 --> 34:28.764
He was out of control.

34:28.833 --> 34:32.291
He used his powers irresponsibly
and all for his own amusement,

34:32.370 --> 34:34.338
and he desperately
needed amusement

34:34.405 --> 34:37.033
because he could find
none here at home.

34:37.108 --> 34:39.474
And l paid the price
for my inappropriate behavior.

34:39.543 --> 34:43.241
No, no, we paid the price
by forcing you to stop,

34:43.313 --> 34:46.579
but for a moment there,
you really had our attention...

34:46.650 --> 34:48.551
my attention.

34:48.619 --> 34:51.315
You gave us something
to talk about,

34:51.389 --> 34:55.291
but then you surrendered
to the will of the Continuum

34:55.359 --> 34:57.850
like a good little Q,
and may l say you've become

34:57.929 --> 35:00.420
a fine, upstanding member
of the Continuum

35:00.498 --> 35:04.525
but l miss
the irrepressible Q...

35:04.602 --> 35:07.969
the one who forced me
to think.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.343
May l borrow this?

35:17.381 --> 35:20.179
This was the beginning
of my fall from grace.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.685
This was the last edition,
by the way.

35:22.753 --> 35:26.189
They shut down the presses
after l wrote that,

35:26.257 --> 35:27.849
but they couldn't
keep me silent.

35:27.925 --> 35:30.860
l continued to speak out
in favor of self-termination.

35:30.928 --> 35:32.361
That's when he lost his mind

35:32.430 --> 35:34.591
and started trying
to destroy himself.

35:34.665 --> 35:36.132
We had no choice
but to confine him

35:36.200 --> 35:37.929
but for his own safety.

35:38.002 --> 35:40.732
Not for my safety, for theirs.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.239
l was the greatest threat
the Continuum had ever known.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.707
They feared me so much,

35:45.776 --> 35:48.768
they had to lock me away
for eternity,

35:48.846 --> 35:51.542
and when they did that,
they were saying

35:51.616 --> 35:54.380
that the individual's rights
will be protected

35:54.452 --> 35:58.889
only so long as they don't
conflict with the state.

35:58.956 --> 36:03.393
Nothing is so dangerous
to a society.

36:03.494 --> 36:08.329
My life's work is complete,
but they force

36:08.366 --> 36:10.129
immortality on me,

36:10.201 --> 36:12.362
and when they do that,

36:12.436 --> 36:15.098
they cheapen
and denigrate my life

36:15.173 --> 36:19.007
and all life in the Continuum,
all life.

36:19.076 --> 36:22.375
Captain, you're an explorer.

36:22.446 --> 36:25.540
What if you had nothing left
to explore?

36:25.616 --> 36:29.347
Would you want to live forever
under those circumstances?

36:29.420 --> 36:30.785
You want me to prove to you

36:30.855 --> 36:33.016
that l suffer in terms
that you can equate

36:33.090 --> 36:35.115
with pain or disease.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.627
Look at us.

36:37.695 --> 36:42.758
When life has become futile,
meaningless, unendurable,

36:42.833 --> 36:45.927
it must be allowed to end.

36:46.003 --> 36:47.800
Can't you see, Captain?

36:47.872 --> 36:53.003
For us,
the disease is immortality.

36:59.684 --> 37:01.413
We rest our case, Captain.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.020
Very well.

37:05.089 --> 37:07.421
l'll make my ruling
in the morning.

37:07.491 --> 37:10.892
We'll be in recess until then.

37:45.029 --> 37:46.053
Trouble sleeping?

37:48.799 --> 37:51.927
Did you ever try warm
Kylerian goat's milk?

37:52.036 --> 37:54.937
Get out!

37:55.006 --> 37:56.803
Did you think about our offer?

37:56.874 --> 37:58.739
You mean your bribe.

37:58.809 --> 38:01.744
Merely an incentive to make
the proper decision.

38:01.846 --> 38:04.815
lt'll play no part
in my deliberations.

38:04.849 --> 38:08.012
No.
l told them it wouldn't.

38:08.085 --> 38:10.781
That's why l talked them into
giving you what you asked for.

38:10.855 --> 38:11.947
You have my word.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.991
He won't go back to the cell.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.652
We'll assign someone
to look after him,

38:16.727 --> 38:18.456
whatever it takes.

38:18.529 --> 38:20.724
lt's what you wanted, isn't it?

38:20.798 --> 38:23.858
That's what l wanted.

38:23.934 --> 38:26.596
So, you've won.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.764
Let's celebrate.

38:28.839 --> 38:30.101
Just you and me--

38:30.174 --> 38:31.698
the two of us.

38:31.776 --> 38:33.505
What?

38:33.577 --> 38:35.101
l'll take you home.

38:35.179 --> 38:36.146
Before you know it,

38:36.213 --> 38:37.908
you'll be scampering
across the meadow

38:37.982 --> 38:39.176
with your little puppies,

38:39.250 --> 38:41.514
the grass
beneath your bare feet.

38:41.585 --> 38:43.280
A man coming over the hill,

38:43.354 --> 38:45.481
way in the distance,
waves to you.

38:45.556 --> 38:47.581
You run to be in his arms,
and as you get closer,

38:47.658 --> 38:50.821
you see that it's... me.

38:50.895 --> 38:52.260
You?!

38:52.330 --> 38:54.855
Forget Mark.

38:54.932 --> 38:57.423
l know how to show a girl
a good time.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.332
How would you like
a ticker tape parade

38:59.403 --> 39:00.563
down Sri Lanka Boulevard?

39:00.671 --> 39:03.538
The Captain
who brought Voyager back--

39:03.574 --> 39:05.337
a celebrated hero.

39:05.409 --> 39:07.377
l never did anything like that
for Jean-Luc,

39:07.445 --> 39:10.505
but l feel very close to you.

39:10.581 --> 39:13.209
l'm not sure why.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.309
Maybe it's because
you have such authority

39:15.386 --> 39:18.913
and yet manage to preserve
your femininity so well.

39:25.396 --> 39:27.023
Leave.

39:29.066 --> 39:32.399
We'll talk about this
after the hearing tomorrow.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.643
l've tried to find
some way to reconcile

39:43.714 --> 39:47.275
all the conflicting emotions
l've felt during this hearing.

39:47.351 --> 39:50.809
My own aversion to suicide.

39:50.888 --> 39:54.255
My compassion
for your situation, Q.

39:54.325 --> 39:57.488
lt hasn't been easy.

39:57.561 --> 40:01.019
l've tried to tell myself
that this is not about suicide,

40:01.098 --> 40:03.726
but about granting asylum,

40:03.801 --> 40:05.530
that l am not
personally being asked

40:05.603 --> 40:07.127
to perform euthanasia,

40:07.204 --> 40:09.331
and as technically true
as that may be,

40:09.407 --> 40:15.277
l cannot escape the moral
implications of my choices.

40:15.346 --> 40:17.974
l've also had to consider
that a decision to grant asylum,

40:18.048 --> 40:21.279
and the subsequent suicide
of a Q,

40:21.352 --> 40:24.253
might have a significant impact
on the Continuum.

40:24.321 --> 40:26.312
That such a decision

40:26.390 --> 40:29.553
could change
the nature of an entire society,

40:29.627 --> 40:32.619
whether it be a favorable
or unfavorable change,

40:32.696 --> 40:34.857
disturbs me greatly.

40:37.968 --> 40:41.961
But then there are the rights of
the individual in this matter.

40:42.039 --> 40:44.701
l don't believe that you are
mentally unbalanced,

40:44.775 --> 40:49.906
and l do believe that you
are suffering intolerably.

40:52.016 --> 40:54.041
Under these conditions,

40:54.118 --> 40:57.485
l find it impossible
to support immortality forced

40:57.555 --> 40:58.920
on an individual by the state.

40:58.989 --> 40:59.978
The unforeseen disruption

41:00.090 --> 41:05.426
that may occur in the Continuum
is not enough, in my opinion,

41:05.496 --> 41:09.956
to justify any additional
suffering by this individual.

41:11.969 --> 41:15.302
So... l hereby grant you asylum.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.908
May l see you in your chambers,
Captain?

41:19.977 --> 41:22.104
You've been in my chambers
enough for one visit, sir.

41:22.179 --> 41:23.305
A sidebar, Your Honor.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.745
Only for a moment.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.339
She ruled in my favor.

41:26.417 --> 41:27.782
You made a promise.

41:36.627 --> 41:39.721
Nothing happened... nothing!

41:39.797 --> 41:42.630
My powers are gone!

41:42.700 --> 41:45.191
l'm mortal.

41:50.140 --> 41:52.608
Well, so much
for ticker tape parades.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.143
l'm not finished.

41:54.211 --> 41:56.042
Q...

41:56.113 --> 41:58.809
now that you're mortal,

41:58.883 --> 42:01.351
you have a new existence
to explore,

42:01.452 --> 42:03.852
an entirely new state of being

42:03.888 --> 42:06.755
filled with the mysteries
of mortal life,

42:06.824 --> 42:08.917
pleasures
you've never felt before.

42:09.026 --> 42:12.792
l like this life, Q.

42:12.863 --> 42:15.730
You might, too.

42:15.799 --> 42:19.326
Think hard
before you give it up.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.677
This hearing is adjourned.

42:28.979 --> 42:32.779
Captain's Log,
Stardate 49301.2.

42:32.850 --> 42:35.546
We have assigned quarters
to our new passenger,

42:35.619 --> 42:38.986
who has entered his name on
our crew manifest as ''Quinn.''

42:39.056 --> 42:41.524
l'm anxious to engage him
in ship activities

42:41.592 --> 42:44.083
as soon as possible.

42:44.161 --> 42:45.594
How about Stellar Cartography?

42:45.663 --> 42:47.528
We could shut down
Stellar Cartography

42:47.598 --> 42:49.395
with all the knowledge
he'd bring to the job.

42:49.466 --> 42:50.831
Well, that's going
to be a problem

42:50.901 --> 42:52.801
with just about everything
we assign him to.

42:52.870 --> 42:55.805
There's got to be something on
board that...

42:55.873 --> 42:56.999
Sick Bay to Captain Janeway.

42:57.141 --> 42:58.108
Go ahead.

42:58.175 --> 42:59.972
Captain, l think you should
come down to Sick Bay.

43:00.077 --> 43:03.478
Mr. Quinn is here.
l'm afraid he's dying.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.283
There's nothing you can do?

43:11.355 --> 43:14.256
He's ingested a rare form
of Nogatch hemlock.

43:14.325 --> 43:15.952
There is no known cure.

43:17.561 --> 43:20.826
l'm sorry to disappoint you,
Captain,

43:20.898 --> 43:23.059
but l would only
have been pretending

43:23.133 --> 43:26.864
to fit in
to this mortal existence.

43:26.937 --> 43:30.373
This is my final gift
to my people.

43:30.441 --> 43:36.971
Oh, tell them those were
my last words.

43:37.047 --> 43:41.677
l dearly thank you
for making this poss...

43:51.629 --> 43:52.994
Doctor,

43:53.063 --> 43:55.463
do you generally keep samples
of fatal poisons in storage?

43:55.532 --> 43:57.295
No.

43:57.368 --> 43:59.996
The replicators
will not produce them either.

44:00.037 --> 44:04.633
So how did he get his hands
on Nogatch hemlock?

44:06.176 --> 44:07.700
l got it for him.

44:09.279 --> 44:12.510
You assisted his suicide?

44:12.583 --> 44:13.515
lllogical, Tuvok?

44:13.584 --> 44:15.347
l don't think so.

44:15.419 --> 44:16.909
By demanding to end his life,

44:16.987 --> 44:19.387
he taught me a little something
about my own.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.083
He was right when he said

44:21.158 --> 44:23.524
the Continuum scared me
back in line.

44:23.594 --> 44:26.586
l didn't have his courage
or his convictions.

44:26.664 --> 44:30.259
He called me ''irrepressible.''

44:30.334 --> 44:34.100
This was a man
who was truly irrepressible.

44:34.171 --> 44:37.038
l only hope
l make a worthy student.

44:38.809 --> 44:40.936
l imagine the Continuum
won't be very happy

44:41.045 --> 44:42.603
with you, Q.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.706
l certainly hope not.

44:45.783 --> 44:48.581
Au revoir, Madam Captain.

44:48.652 --> 44:50.643
We will meet again.
