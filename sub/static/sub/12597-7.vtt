That's gonna look great,
carl.

00:17.018 --> 00:20.319
Great? Liv!
That was amazing!

00:20.321 --> 00:22.321
Yeah, we have a big fight
coming up later,

00:22.323 --> 00:24.723
So we're just practicing now
so that it looks real.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.392
What brings you by, joe?

00:26.394 --> 00:28.227
Well, can't a loving brother
just stop by

00:28.229 --> 00:30.162
To say hi
to his super-hero sis?

00:30.164 --> 00:31.497
Yeah, of course.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.632
You're just
so not that brother.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.969
No. No, I am not.

00:36.971 --> 00:41.673
I am the brother

00:46.313 --> 00:49.648

00:49.650 --> 00:52.418
A  <i> voltage  </i> frying pan?

What--
<i>voltage  </i> peanut butter?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.855
You know it.

00:56.857 --> 01:00.192
You put the  <i> voltage  </i> logo

01:00.194 --> 01:02.761
Okay, once you sign
this "junk,"

01:02.763 --> 01:06.532
It becomes memorabilia.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.600
Liv, look at this.

They are

Okay, girls,
welcome to camp porcupine!

02:42.263 --> 02:44.596
You girls are going
to have so much fun
this week

02:44.598 --> 02:47.466
Learning all about
the best sport in the world--

02:47.468 --> 02:49.801
Both:
Basketball!

02:49.803 --> 02:52.804
So I am coach maddie

02:52.806 --> 02:54.373
And this is coach willow.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.943
We met at a basketball camp
when we were your age.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.211
Yup.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.313
And we're still friends
and teammates today.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.449
So we are going
to teach you girls
how to play basketball

03:04.451 --> 03:07.152
Like the state champion
ridgewood porcupines.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.688
(both squawking)

03:09.690 --> 03:12.891
(sighs) so that
is our porcupine cheer.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.227
Feel free to join in.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.696
-Yes.
-Porcupines don't sound
like that.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.633
Lula's right.
She would know.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.670
Her dad's a forest ranger.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.739
Okay, well, thank you,
anina and lula.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.376
Willow and I are running
a camp for young girls

03:31.378 --> 03:33.378
Because we are so passionate
about encouraging them

03:33.380 --> 03:35.414
To play
competitive basketball.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.916
It also looks
really good on all of
our college applications.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.719
But it is mostly
the passionate part.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.322
How lucky
are you girls?

03:43.324 --> 03:46.525
You are being taught
by our mvp,

03:46.527 --> 03:48.694
Maddie "mad dog" rooney,

03:48.696 --> 03:52.097
Who is going
to southern california
state university

03:52.099 --> 03:54.833
Next year
on a basketball scholarship.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.069
All: Wow!

03:58.772 --> 04:03.375
Thanks, willow.
But no one has offered me
a scholarship yet, so...

04:03.377 --> 04:05.177
Well, they're gonna.

04:05.179 --> 04:08.280
'cause she's, like,
really good.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.283
Yeah.
Scsu is my dream school.

04:11.285 --> 04:14.086
Um, I visited there
when my sister liv

04:14.088 --> 04:15.520
Was living in la,

04:15.522 --> 04:17.222
And the coach let me
play with the team.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.891
All:
Cool!

04:19.893 --> 04:22.761
I helped maddie
make a highlight reel
of our game footage

04:22.763 --> 04:24.863
To get her a scholarship
to scsu.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.566
One day, she'll play
in a national championship

04:27.568 --> 04:29.968
And I will propose to joey
on a jumbotron!

04:29.970 --> 04:32.537
You can't say no
on a jumbotron!

04:32.539 --> 04:34.806
Right?

04:37.244 --> 04:39.444
Hey, dr. P,
wanna go to the park
after lunch

04:39.446 --> 04:41.546
And see who can spit
over the top of the backstop?

04:41.548 --> 04:43.415
A spitting contest?

04:43.417 --> 04:45.384
You picked the wrong fight,
son.

04:45.386 --> 04:50.322
I've got a loogie
in the back of my throat
I've been working on for days.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.823
Let's go.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.058
And no!

04:53.060 --> 04:54.726
I need you
to sit back down, boys.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.095
But, mom, we're spittin'!

04:57.097 --> 05:00.599
Mmm. Honey, I need you
to sit back down,

05:00.601 --> 05:02.501
Swallow your loogie,

05:02.503 --> 05:05.003
And finish your
brussels sprouts just like
you finished your meatballs.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.839
But meatballs
taste like meatballs.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.309
Brussels sprouts
taste like butt.

05:10.311 --> 05:14.579
Okay. Well,
until they invent vegetables
that taste like meatballs,

05:14.581 --> 05:17.316
You are stuck eating,
ahem, butt.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.652
Challenge accepted!

05:20.654 --> 05:23.121
Challenge?
What challenge?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.790
The challenge of turning
butt-tasting vegetables

05:24.792 --> 05:26.358
Into delicious meatballs.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.027
-What?
-Mm-hmm.
Good luck with that, kids.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.263
Dr. P doesn't need luck.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.432
Reggie, turning veggies
into meatballs

05:33.434 --> 05:35.767
Has stumped scientists
for centuries.

05:35.769 --> 05:39.004
I know it won't be easy,
but being a legend never is.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.307
Remember when my gerbil,
run-d.M.Gerbil, died?

05:42.309 --> 05:46.678
That little dude always
dreamed of touching the stars.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.948
Yeah. I sent him
into outer space
in a soup can.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.384
That was you
making dreams come true.

05:52.386 --> 05:55.554
I have kind of given reggie
the impression

05:55.556 --> 05:57.556
I can do anything.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.525
Sometimes I worry
that's the main reason
he hangs out with me.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.561
I can't let my buddy down.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.197
No "buddy" left behind.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.899
Come on!
Build a machine that'll make
so many meatballs,

06:07.901 --> 06:11.169
We can make
meatball snow angels!

06:11.171 --> 06:14.973
You know what?
Challenge accepted!

06:14.975 --> 06:17.209
This one's for you,
run-d.M.Gerbil.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.578
May your space wheel
never stop spinning.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.885
Hey, sister

06:26.887 --> 06:28.420
Whom I love

06:28.422 --> 06:30.756
And would never
purposely injure.

06:32.359 --> 06:35.093
How are things?

06:35.095 --> 06:39.564
I don't know.
How about you ask
my broken toe, joe?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.333
What? Because of me?

06:41.335 --> 06:44.236
No, I'm--
liv, I'm so sorry.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.605
Yeah, they shut down
production on  <i> voltage.</i>

06:46.607 --> 06:49.040
It's okay.
I mean, there's really nothing
that you can do about it now.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.676
No. No, you know what?
That it not true.

06:51.678 --> 06:54.546
I, joseph gilligan rooney,

06:54.548 --> 06:56.681
Do hereby pledge
to be your manservant

06:56.683 --> 06:59.351
Until such a time
as you are healed.

06:59.353 --> 07:02.220
Oh, joey, that is
definitely not necessary

07:02.222 --> 07:04.890
And actually
not very appealing.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.893
Liv, please.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.694
Please let me
make this up to you.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.096
I feel so horrible.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.931
There's got to be something
I could do.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.633
Come on, my wizard code
demands it.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.636
Well, I don't want you
to feel bad.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.471
Yeah.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.474
And I guess it is going
to be kind of hard for me
to get around places.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.476
Yeah.
Just relax.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.411
Your wish is my command.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.814
I am a little hungry.

07:28.816 --> 07:32.551
Lucky for you,
I've got a sandwich
in my pocket.

07:39.660 --> 07:43.228
Boom!
You just got man-served!

07:47.601 --> 07:51.136
Whoa! Is that the mail?
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!

07:51.138 --> 07:54.739
Okay, um, not from scsu,

07:54.741 --> 07:57.642
Not from scsu, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.779
What-- what is this?
This is all garbage!

08:00.781 --> 08:02.714
And my paycheck.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.619
Just-- you know what it is?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.187
You know what I think
it really is?

08:09.189 --> 08:11.823
I think that the mailman
is just stealing my letters
from scsu.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.193
Yeah. I mean,
'cause that's the only,
like, logical explanation.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.628
I mean,
unless they rejected me.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.663
But tell me
they didn't reject me!

08:18.665 --> 08:20.165
-Okay. Okay, maddie?
-Yeah.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.602
I know that waiting to see
if you got a scholarship
is stressful.

08:23.604 --> 08:27.939
But relax.
I'll bet scsu hasn't sent
a letter to anyone yet.

08:27.941 --> 08:31.309
-Yeah.
-Scsu sent me a letter!

08:31.311 --> 08:33.144
I got a scholarship!

08:33.146 --> 08:35.714
What? Really?

08:35.716 --> 08:38.183
Yeah. The recruiter saw me
on your highlight reel

08:38.185 --> 08:40.218
And then called ridgewood
to get my info.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.687
Now we can play together
for the next four years!

08:42.689 --> 08:46.858
Five if we fail some classes!

08:46.860 --> 08:48.793
Congratulations, willow.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.161
Thanks, mrs. R.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.797
Mads, we get to be together
at scsu!

08:52.799 --> 08:54.866
I call top bunk!

08:55.903 --> 08:58.136
I actually
didn't get a letter.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.505
Oh. Are you sure?

09:00.507 --> 09:04.843
Not from scsu, not from scsu,
no, no, no.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.913
The mailman must be
stealing your letters!

09:07.915 --> 09:10.482
Let's go get that jerk!

09:10.484 --> 09:12.651
Come on.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.855
Thank you for coming, reggie.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.224
You might want
to take off your hat

09:19.226 --> 09:21.593
Because I'm about
to blow your mind!

09:23.730 --> 09:27.799
Behold!
The veg-a-meat-a-ball-inator!

09:29.102 --> 09:32.170
In go the gross vegetables
teeming with icky flavor.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.540
(whirring)

09:35.542 --> 09:37.375
What's it doing?
What's it doing?

09:37.377 --> 09:40.512
The veg-a-meat-a-ball-inator
is now infusing
the vegetables

09:40.514 --> 09:41.646
With meaty goodness.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.384
(fanfare)

09:46.386 --> 09:48.753
(whirring dies down)

09:48.755 --> 09:52.190
Reggie, eat your vegetables.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.194
Excellent texture.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.431
Complex flavor.
Just a hint of umami.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.400
This veggie meatball
shouldn't be possible.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.637
But with dr. P,
anything's possible.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.639
It's not possible.

10:07.641 --> 10:11.610
There's no scientific way
to turn veggies into meat.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.613
He's eating
100% meat meatballs.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.648
I just couldn't
disappoint my friend.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.217
I'm not proud
of the lie.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.920
But I am proud
of my meatballs.
They're delicious.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.723
I can't believe eating healthy
tastes this good.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.992
Try it
with the teriyaki sauce.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.127
(whirs)

10:29.129 --> 10:30.795
(fanfare)

10:32.933 --> 10:34.866
Mind blown.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.739
Hey.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.841
Your manservant/
handsome brother

10:42.843 --> 10:45.677
Brought you
your favorite soup
from your favorite soup place,

10:45.679 --> 10:48.513
Casey o-soupy's.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.849
Oh!
(sniffs)

10:50.851 --> 10:54.285
Ooh, that chicken noodle soup
smells amazing.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.321
Chicken?
I thought I got barley.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.657
(both gasping)

10:58.659 --> 11:01.860
-Hot, hot, hot!
-Oh, liv, I'm so sorry!

11:01.862 --> 11:03.928
It's okay.
It's okay.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.031
I'm really actually
not hungry.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.334
Okay, all right.
Then your manservant
will switch gears.

11:09.336 --> 11:13.772
How about I curl your hair?

11:13.774 --> 11:16.541
(squeals)

11:16.543 --> 11:20.845
I really don't think
that's such a good idea.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.981
Trust me, I'm good at it.

11:22.983 --> 11:26.384
Mom makes me do her hair
before our late-night
supermarket runs,

11:26.386 --> 11:30.055
And she is
the hottest old lady
in the applesauce aisle.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.458
Please never repeat
that sentence again.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.126
Like, ever.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.796
Just sit back, relax,

11:37.798 --> 11:41.800
And let the salon master
joe-say roo-nay do your 'do.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.843
Mmm. This is actually
kind of nice.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.412
Thanks, joe-say.
(laughs)

11:54.414 --> 11:56.881
It's the least I could do
for crushing your toe

11:56.883 --> 11:59.718
And spilling hot soup
all over you.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.786
(sizzling)

12:11.098 --> 12:13.598
All right, team!
Good run!

12:13.600 --> 12:15.366
Now make sure you drink
plenty of water.

12:15.368 --> 12:19.904
Yeah, okay.
So today we are going
to work on jump shots.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.040
Before we get started,
does anybody have
any questions?

12:22.042 --> 12:24.676
Do you have pink cups?

12:24.678 --> 12:26.277
Basketball questions,
anina.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.980
Do you have pink cups
for basketball practice?

12:31.251 --> 12:35.019
So non-cup-related
basketball questions.
Anybody?

12:35.021 --> 12:38.456
Coach maddie,
did you get your scholarship
from scsu yet?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.892
Mmm. No, actually,
I did not.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.927
But coach willow did.

12:42.929 --> 12:46.731
But scsu was the school
you wanted to get
recruited to.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.934
It sure is.
And I am sure she will.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.103
Why would they pick you
over coach maddie?

12:52.105 --> 12:55.540
Duh. Because coach willow
must be better than
coach maddie.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.975
But maddie was mvp.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.977
Not at scsu, she wasn't.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.279
I guess willow's the best.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.783
The best?
She wouldn't even
be on scsu's radar

13:04.785 --> 13:06.951
If it wasn't for me.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.421
Because I'm not good enough?

13:10.423 --> 13:13.158
That's not
what I meant to say.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.626
Yeah, but you said it.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.427
I heard it.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.429
Ha.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.399
No, no, no, no.
I didn't mean it.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.067
You know?
I'm sorry.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.170
I'm just honestly--
I think what it is

13:25.172 --> 13:27.305
Is I'm not used to
coming in second best.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.940
Oh, okay.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.276
So this friendship only works
when you're the mvp

13:31.278 --> 13:33.745
And I'm, what? The faithful,
supportive friend.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.947
No! Willow--

13:35.949 --> 13:38.016
No, why can't you
just be happy for me?

13:38.018 --> 13:40.852
-I--
-I celebrate
all your success, maddie.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.488
What? One win for me
and you can't handle that?

13:44.958 --> 13:47.258
That is not my idea
of friendship.

13:51.998 --> 13:52.964
Is camp over?

13:52.966 --> 13:56.334
Because my mom works
until 3:00.

14:03.376 --> 14:07.212
Is there anything
better than playing
meatball checkers?

14:07.214 --> 14:12.250
Well, it is
going better than
your meatball tennis idea.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.520
King me.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.227
Reggie was going
through meatballs so fast

14:22.229 --> 14:24.128
That I couldn't keep up.

14:24.130 --> 14:27.131
So I created a giant
meatball storage tank
on the roof.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.667
They come down a tube,
through a wall

14:29.669 --> 14:31.069
And into a machine.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.204
I'm trapped in a lie--

14:33.206 --> 14:36.341
A delicious, meaty lie.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.977
(sighs)

14:38.979 --> 14:43.548
Parker!
Why can't he invent something
that puts itself away?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.485
Are you...

14:47.487 --> 14:50.021
Kidding?

14:50.023 --> 14:51.422
I made you
a little something.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.559
It's a meatball necklace.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.999
(meatballs rolling)

15:01.001 --> 15:04.269
-(house creaking)
-uh-oh.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.815
It's raining meatballs!

15:20.086 --> 15:23.221
Dr. P!
You  <i> are  </i> a miracle worker!

15:23.223 --> 15:26.758
Reggie, I'm not
a miracle worker.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.927
I'm a liar.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.962
The veg-a-meat-a-ball-inator
is a fake.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.965
I didn't make meatballs
from vegetables,

15:33.967 --> 15:37.201
I just put real meatballs
into a tank on the roof,

15:37.203 --> 15:41.205
Which has somehow exploded.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.975
But why would you lie?

15:43.977 --> 15:47.545
Because it was the first time
I couldn't meet a challenge.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.647
And I didn't want
to let you down.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.216
Dr. P,
you could never let me down.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.953
I look up to you
because you'll try anything.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.888
Thanks, reggie.
It means a lot.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.290
Besides, all I really
wanted to do

15:59.292 --> 16:01.559
Was to make
meatball snow angels
with my best friend.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.995
Well, shoot,
we can do that right now.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.064
Drop and give me angel!

16:06.066 --> 16:09.734
We're probably
the first people
in the history of the world

16:09.736 --> 16:12.303
To make meatball snow angels.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.810
Welcome to the final frontier!

16:25.618 --> 16:27.118
Hey, mads.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.920
Don't even start
because I'm fine.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.989
And no, I have not
talked to willow yet.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.825
Quit asking me
all these questions
and give me some space.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.128
I wasn't going
to say anything.

16:37.130 --> 16:40.131
Okay. Okay!
(laughing)

16:40.133 --> 16:43.468
You really weren't
going to say anything?

16:43.470 --> 16:46.270
It's really tough

16:46.272 --> 16:49.173
When a friend gets something
that you want.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.376
But, maddie,
it's not willow's fault

16:51.378 --> 16:53.845
That she got that scholarship
and not you.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.514
And a scholarship
is very important,

16:56.516 --> 17:00.051
But a best friend
is so much more than that.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.223
I thought I told you
to give me some space.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.360
Thank you.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.063
And by the way,
I hope your toe feels better.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.998
Thanks.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.868
It's so super weird.
It really only hurts
when joey is around.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.472
-Livvie, liv, liv!
-Get out!

17:23.576 --> 17:25.910
I mean, hey, joey.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.178
Hey.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.881
I have a surprise for you.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.616
Oh!

17:37.657 --> 17:41.659
Who's ready for dinner
and a show?

17:41.661 --> 17:45.229
Yeah.
I'm out.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.298
Don't leave me.

17:49.936 --> 17:53.671
Joey, what are you doing?

17:53.673 --> 17:58.209
I am treating you
to your favorite
dining experience,

17:58.211 --> 17:59.811
Teppanyaki!

18:01.014 --> 18:03.381
The ancient japanese art
of cooking

18:03.383 --> 18:05.183
With a sizzling-hot griddle

18:05.185 --> 18:08.086
And razor-sharp knives.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.223
-Joey, don't!
-Liv, relax.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.193
I took a 20-minute
online tutorial.
All right?

18:15.195 --> 18:17.795
Just sit back and let
my knife-flipping skills

18:17.797 --> 18:20.932
Take you
on a culinary adventure.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.281
A little slippy
on the grippy.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.317
Okay, stop!

18:39.319 --> 18:40.651
Put your knives down.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.422
Mmm, because...

18:44.424 --> 18:47.592
Ding! Oh, what was that?
Oh, it's-- I got a text.

18:47.594 --> 18:51.762
Oh, it's from--
it's from my--
it's from my doctor!

18:51.764 --> 18:54.899
And he says
that I'm fine!

18:54.901 --> 18:58.503
I guess toe bones...

18:58.505 --> 19:01.739
Heal really super fast!

19:01.741 --> 19:04.175
Who knew?

19:04.177 --> 19:07.912
Must have been all that tlc
that I got from my brother.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.248
Yay! I'm useful.

19:12.652 --> 19:17.155
Okay. So yesterday
got a little tense.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.191
But today,
we are back to basketball.

19:20.193 --> 19:23.261
And we are going to be
working on some free throws.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.795
Where's coach willow?

19:24.797 --> 19:27.765
Um, I don't think
she's going to be
coming today.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.500
'cause she's mad at you?

19:29.502 --> 19:32.436
Wow, you just cut
right to it, don't you?

19:32.438 --> 19:34.805
I don't want to
play basketball anymore.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.674
It destroys friendships.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.943
Big time.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.282
Okay, let's--
let's huddle up real quick.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.084
Little team meeting.

19:48.988 --> 19:52.957
So basketball
is an amazing game.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.226
And if I have made it
seem like anything else,

19:55.228 --> 19:57.528
I'm really, truly sorry.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.831
And being on a team
is a privilege

20:00.833 --> 20:05.036
Because you get
a special group of friends
called teammates.

20:05.038 --> 20:09.840
And teammates see you
at your best

20:09.842 --> 20:13.044
And definitely
at your worst.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.549
And if you don't let them know
how much you appreciate them,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.518
You risk losing them

20:20.520 --> 20:23.421
Because you're just
a big stupid head.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.958
You are a big stupid head.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.063
I didn't think
you were going to come.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.498
I stopped
to get pink cups.

20:37.704 --> 20:41.439
I'm so sorry
that I was so jealous.

20:41.441 --> 20:45.843
I am so proud of you
for getting that scholarship.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.511
I'm thrilled.
And you deserve it.

20:47.513 --> 20:50.748
I'm just--
I'm really nervous

20:50.750 --> 20:52.950
That something that
I've wanted for so long

20:52.952 --> 20:54.919
Maybe isn't going to happen
for me.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.454
Oh, maddie.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.357
You're gonna get in too.

20:59.359 --> 21:04.395
And even if you don't,
you will always be
my teammate.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.234
They made up.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.136
They're best friends again.

21:12.138 --> 21:16.540
I'm crying
and I don't know why!

21:16.542 --> 21:18.943
(all laughing)

21:18.945 --> 21:21.445
Come here, girls.
Let's do a big group hug.

21:23.316 --> 21:26.384
(making porcupine sound)

21:30.423 --> 21:33.024
(playing)

21:36.896 --> 21:39.330
You're not liv.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.401
Joey, what are you doing
in my room?

21:43.403 --> 21:44.969
Well, I'm taking care
of liv.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.438
And so when
she went back to work,
I thought when she got home,

21:47.440 --> 21:50.574
She would want to hear
the soothing sounds
of my squeezebox.

21:50.576 --> 21:54.945
Okay, joey,
no one wants to hear
your stupid squeezebox.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.180
Get out.

21:56.182 --> 22:00.117
Okay, I don't think
you understand,

22:00.119 --> 22:02.253
-I'm her manservant, so--
-right.

22:02.255 --> 22:05.489
So she's healed now
and no longer needs you.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.458
Get out.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.594
Well, I hope
I don't injure you,

22:10.596 --> 22:13.998
'cause it won't be any fun
being your manservant.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.200
Okay, get out.

22:21.874 --> 22:25.376
Liv?
What are you doing?

22:25.378 --> 22:27.545
Pretending to be you
to scare joey away.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.848
He's way more afraid
of you than he is of me.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.584
Yeah, true dat.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.221
By the way,

22:37.223 --> 22:40.491
Your maddie is getting,
like, really good.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.226
I know, right?

22:42.228 --> 22:44.995
Both:
Bam! What?

22:44.997 --> 22:46.497
Yes.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.899
Joey:
A little slippy
on the grippy.

22:48.901 --> 22:49.967
(boings)
