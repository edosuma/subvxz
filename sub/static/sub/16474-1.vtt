01:25.080 --> 01:26.229
So?

01:26.680 --> 01:27.829
This is the only alligator.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.477
Four minutes past. We walk in one minute.
He was clear on that.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.229
He's coming.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.438
No, he's too young to
have that kind of access.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.314
Uh, what time does
the restaurant open?

02:05.400 --> 02:08.550
Noon. But the food's
a little too spicy.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.029
This way.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.118
Excuse me.
Uh-huh.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.480
Thank you.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.189
Right here.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.271
It's, uh, really great
to finally meet you guys.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.074
So, first thing, can I get your
cell phones, please?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.589
Thank you.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.874
We want Laura to be
the only one recording, right?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.678
As discussed? Thank you.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.719
I actually bought this.
It blocks UHF frequencies.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.118
You've been
photographed before, right?

03:37.640 --> 03:40.871
Yeah, it's been a while since anybody
took a photo of me, so...

03:40.960 --> 03:42.837
Try thinking of
this as your friend.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.388
Take your time.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.315
Um...

03:51.120 --> 03:53.190
Can you start by telling us
why you did what you did

03:53.280 --> 03:55.350
and, uh, how you gained access

03:55.440 --> 03:56.998
to such a vast
amount of information,

03:57.160 --> 03:58.673
all of which I read
on the plane

03:58.800 --> 04:00.677
and...
Glenn.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.471
Uh, how about we just start
with your name? Okay?

04:09.360 --> 04:12.830
My name is
Edward Joseph Snowden.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.389
I'm 29 years old.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.029
I work as a private
contractor for the NSA.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.031
I've also worked as
a private contractor

04:23.200 --> 04:27.637
for the CIA and directly
for the Agency.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.109
I've worked in various jobs
in the intelligence industry

04:30.200 --> 04:31.872
for the last nine years.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.199
I've been a systems engineer, uh,
been a solutions consultant...

04:37.320 --> 04:39.151
Uh...

04:39.320 --> 04:43.074
And a senior advisor for
the Central Intelligence Agency.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.376
- Rangers...
- Rangers...

04:45.400 --> 04:47.072
- Rangers...
- Rangers...

04:47.160 --> 04:48.496
So you
wanna be Special Forces?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.033
Sir, yes, sir!

04:50.120 --> 04:52.634
I think Special Forces
would be ashamed

04:52.720 --> 04:54.950
to call you soldiers.
Am I right?

04:55.040 --> 04:56.234
Sir, no, sir!

04:56.320 --> 05:00.518
Your left.
Your left, right. Your left.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.876
Went from driving Cadillacs

05:05.240 --> 05:08.277
Went from driving Cadillacs

05:08.760 --> 05:12.435
To driving convoys in Iraq

05:12.560 --> 05:15.199
To driving convoys in Iraq

05:15.400 --> 05:16.674
Move it, soldier!

05:20.400 --> 05:22.231
Go! Go!
Move now!

05:23.760 --> 05:25.398
Move!
You better get going!

05:25.520 --> 05:27.192
Pick it up,
you waste of space!

05:27.760 --> 05:28.954
Let's move!

05:31.200 --> 05:32.758
Come on, soldier! Go!

05:34.120 --> 05:35.348
Come on, darling!

05:36.560 --> 05:38.416
Snowden?
What the hell are you doing?

05:38.440 --> 05:39.475
Nothing, sir!

05:39.560 --> 05:41.391
Where is your fucking heart?
Right here, sir!

05:41.480 --> 05:44.000
I want you to reach way down in
that pathetic excuse of a chest,

05:44.040 --> 05:45.314
and you rip it out.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.072
You find your heart,
and then you get

05:47.200 --> 05:48.952
your broke ass on my tower!
You got that?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.040
Sir, yes, sir!

05:50.120 --> 05:52.000
Now get
the fuck out of my face!

05:53.320 --> 05:56.312
I need you on my tower,
gentlemen! Let's move!

05:59.720 --> 06:01.597
Move! Move! Let's go!

06:01.720 --> 06:04.678
Rise and shine, maggots!

06:04.800 --> 06:08.110
Get your hands off your dicks,
and get the fuck out of my barracks!

06:08.200 --> 06:09.519
You guys got one minute!

06:09.600 --> 06:11.795
Fall out! Move, move, move!

06:11.920 --> 06:14.080
Get the hell out here!
Get the hell out of my barracks!

06:14.720 --> 06:16.096
Move it!
Keep moving!

06:16.120 --> 06:18.429
Let's go!
All right, gentlemen.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.336
- Harrison?
- Here!

06:22.360 --> 06:23.496
- Carson?
- Here!

06:23.520 --> 06:24.616
- Ramirez?
- Here!

06:24.640 --> 06:25.675
Fuck!

06:25.760 --> 06:27.240
- Pierce?
- Here!

06:27.320 --> 06:28.514
Coulson?
Help!

06:28.600 --> 06:29.794
Snowden!

06:30.640 --> 06:33.791
Snowden!
Where the fuck is Snowden?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.632
Help!

06:36.680 --> 06:39.592
You know, you've been walking
around on two broken legs...

06:39.680 --> 06:41.796
Best I can tell, for weeks.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.233
Now this is what happens when
you put a 80-pound rucksack

06:47.320 --> 06:48.548
on a 150-pound body.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.915
You get these little stress
fractures and...

06:51.320 --> 06:52.320
Easy.
Sorry.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.588
They build up
in your tibias.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.752
You don't get off of 'em,
and eventually they just bust.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.308
Now, you're gonna be
here for a few weeks,

06:59.720 --> 07:02.917
and then I'd count on
another eight weeks or so

07:03.000 --> 07:04.194
on the crutches.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.032
Okay,
and then when do I go back?

07:06.120 --> 07:09.271
Son, you ever again
land on those legs of yours,

07:09.360 --> 07:12.750
airborne or not, those
bones will turn to powder.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.308
I'm gonna authorize
an administrative discharge.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.829
Plenty of other ways
to serve your country.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.760
Have you ever committed
a crime for which you weren't caught?

07:46.400 --> 07:47.435
No.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.915
Have you ever cheated on an exam?

07:53.640 --> 07:54.640
No.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.753
Do you believe
the United States

07:57.880 --> 07:59.320
is the greatest
country in the world?

07:59.640 --> 08:00.834
Yes.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.557
Why do you
want to join the CIA?

08:05.160 --> 08:07.520
How would you
explain the Internet to a child?

08:09.320 --> 08:12.995
Granddad retired as
an admiral and joined the FBI.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.674
Dad's in the Coast Guard,
30-year man.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.593
What has been the
most important day in your life?

08:18.680 --> 08:20.193
9/11.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.919
We thought my grandfather
was inside the Pentagon.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.873
Uh, turned out he was
off-site that day.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.508
You wanted
to be Special Forces?

08:28.600 --> 08:32.912
Yes, sir. Yeah, I love their motto.
De oppresso liber.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.755
Is that what you hope to do
with us? Free people from oppression?

08:37.840 --> 08:40.274
I'd like to help my country
make a difference in the world.

08:40.480 --> 08:44.314
Uh, the Internet
is a technology

08:45.240 --> 08:46.719
that has the power

08:46.800 --> 08:50.315
to let everyone in the world
understand each other.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.871
Missed a perfect score on the
ASVAB test by a single question.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.714
Crushed the language
learning test.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.394
Some Mandarin,
some Japanese.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.831
And no high school diploma.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.871
So why did you stop
attending high school?

09:08.520 --> 09:12.399
I had to make money. My parents
were divorcing at the time.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.918
Any other influences?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.790
I'd say Joseph Campbell,

09:19.640 --> 09:23.235
Star Wars,
Thoreau, Ayn Rand...

09:24.440 --> 09:27.637
One man can stop
the motor of the world.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.154
Atlas Shrugged.
Yes, sir. I believe that.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.630
Let's try again.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.149
Why do you want
to join the CIA?

09:38.240 --> 09:39.468
Uh...

09:39.760 --> 09:42.558
Well, frankly, sir,

09:44.400 --> 09:47.517
it sounds really cool to have
top security clearance.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.353
It's not enough.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.549
Ordinarily. But these
are not ordinary times.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.476
Bombs won't stop terrorism,
brains will,

10:13.600 --> 10:15.670
and we don't have
nearly enough of those.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.110
I'm gonna give you
a shot, Snowden.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.593
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
You won't regret this.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.037
My name's Corbin O'Brian.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.680
I have many titles,
among them Senior Instructor.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.870
You'll be joining
my class at The Hill.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.999
Stop the vehicle.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.195
Shut off the engine.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.119
I need to see your ID.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.156
All right. Using your left hand only,
pop the trunk.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.856
Now place
your hands

10:48.880 --> 10:50.757
through the steering wheel
on the dashboard.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.553
Through the steering wheel.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.634
On the dashboard.
Do not exit the vehicle.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.760
Right here. Right here.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.673
Excuse me.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.592
You'll be looking
for Corbin's class.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.353
End of the hall, keep going
through the second set of doors.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.910
Thank you.
Is that an Enigma?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.908
No.
Enigma was broken.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.798
This is the follow up,
the Sigaba. Never broken.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.068
Cold War's greatest
encryption machine.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.472
Tides of history ticked with
this motor and these rotors.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.433
One day everyone's gonna want
a machine like this. Wow!

11:40.120 --> 11:43.317
I always wanted to learn cryptography.
What's this one?

11:43.960 --> 11:45.757
The Hot Line.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.593
First direct link between
Washington and Moscow.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.716
Probably
prevented World War III.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.869
You got a name? How do I
know you're not the enemy?

11:55.960 --> 11:57.837
Oh, sorry. Uh,
Snowden. Ed Snowden.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.798
Hank Forrester.
Where'd you study, Snowden?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.836
Mostly I'm,
uh, self-taught.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.834
You can tell me if you're busy,
but is that a Cray-1?

12:07.320 --> 12:09.788
Why, yes. Yes, it is.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.398
The first supercomputer.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.200
You can get all of
this on a cell phone now.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.953
Yeah. So you're,
um, an engineer?

12:18.360 --> 12:21.830
Am I an engineer?
Instructor and counselor, too.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.150
I'm supposed to keep
an eye on you CTs,

12:24.240 --> 12:26.310
make sure you don't buckle
under the pressure.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.674
Turn to drugs and booze.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.795
Well, you won't have that problem with me.
I don't drink or do drugs.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.518
What is your sin
of choice?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.511
Uh, computers.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.749
Well, then, Snowden, you've come
to the right little whorehouse.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.512
The front lines in
the global war on terror

12:46.600 --> 12:48.511
are not in Iraq
or Afghanistan.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.990
They're here. In London,

12:54.240 --> 12:55.680
Berlin,

12:56.560 --> 12:57.754
Istanbul...

12:58.440 --> 13:00.670
Any server,
any connection...

13:02.120 --> 13:04.714
The modern battlefield

13:05.320 --> 13:06.594
is everywhere.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.993
Which means

13:10.600 --> 13:14.798
you don't have to sit in the ditch
eating MREs or dodging mortar fire,

13:14.880 --> 13:20.671
it means that if there is another
9/11, it'll be your fault.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.400
Just as the last one
was my generation's.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.718
Believe me, you do not want
to live with that burden.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.235
We're gonna start
with an aptitude test.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.831
Each of you is gonna build
a covert communications network

13:42.920 --> 13:44.399
in your home city,

13:45.960 --> 13:50.158
you're gonna deploy it,
back up your site, destroy it,

13:50.240 --> 13:51.912
and restore it again.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.798
The point of this
exercise is to keep

13:54.880 --> 13:57.474
your infrastructure up
and running securely.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.759
The average test
time is five hours.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.118
If you take more than eight,
you will fail.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.199
Mr. O'Brian?

14:32.640 --> 14:33.959
I'm done, sir.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.840
You don't have to tell me
when you've completed a stage.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.797
No, I finished
the whole thing.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.158
It's been 40 minutes.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.514
Thirty-eight.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.794
What?

14:44.480 --> 14:45.799
Thirty-eight minutes.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.715
Okay. Let's see
where you screwed up.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.759
You didn't say we had
to do it in order, sir.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.912
So I, uh, broke
the sequence to save time,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.073
and I automated the backup process
to run as I built the site.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.034
Eyes on screens.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.509
Sir?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.472
What should I do now?

15:37.560 --> 15:38.913
Whatever you want.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.911
Hey.
Hi.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.197
Finally.
Yeah.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.470
Um, sorry.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.232
Do you, um,
want anything?

16:35.320 --> 16:38.039
No. Let's go
for a walk.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.792
You could use some sun.

16:40.240 --> 16:44.074
Yeah.
You mentioned that earlier.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.469
Sorry it took me
this long. I just...

16:47.880 --> 16:51.759
You didn't want to see me on crutches.
I was not so agile.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.712
And then this
new job hit. So...

16:53.800 --> 16:56.234
Oh, yeah, what was it
you were doing again?

16:56.320 --> 16:58.231
I'm doing analysis for
the State Department.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.356
Right. Congratulations.
Thanks.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.873
You're welcome.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.678
Hey, can you
do me a favor

17:03.760 --> 17:05.990
and, um, point in the direction
of the State Department?

17:06.760 --> 17:07.954
Uh...

17:11.160 --> 17:12.593
Yeah, it's that way.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.390
Where? Are you sure?

17:16.520 --> 17:19.272
I mean, I'm not that great
at orienting myself...

17:19.359 --> 17:21.589
Not that great
at lying, either.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.273
You're gonna have to work on
both if you wanna be a spy.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.479
Where I came from,
everyone's parents

17:27.560 --> 17:29.630
worked for
the "State Department."

17:29.880 --> 17:32.678
Plus, every time you visited
my website this week,

17:32.760 --> 17:36.514
which was quite often,
it was from an IP in Virginia.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.756
You know how to run an IP trace?
Yeah.

17:39.360 --> 17:43.069
I'm pretty sure that the State
Department has no offices in Virginia.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.953
Huh?

17:52.440 --> 17:53.873
All right,
let's see you strut it.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.514
Let's see what?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.216
Let's see you strut it. Show
me what you got, you know.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.912
Your best catwalk.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.435
Don't be shy.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.795
Come on. You got this.
Uh... All right.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.635
I don't know.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.256
Drop Bush, not bombs!

18:17.280 --> 18:20.989
Drop Bush, not bombs!

18:21.200 --> 18:23.360
Excuse me. Would you mind
signing our petition, please?

18:23.440 --> 18:24.759
Yes, absolutely.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.758
Thank you.
Thank you so much. Sir?

18:28.840 --> 18:29.909
No, thank you.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.216
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you like to sign?

18:34.240 --> 18:35.976
I actually just signed. Yeah.
Okay. Thank you very much.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Thank you.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.516
Too much independent
spirit for you?

18:41.120 --> 18:44.829
Uh, no, I just don't really
like bashing my country.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.714
It's my country too, and right
now it has blood on its hands.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.112
Sorry, I just... I have friends
who are over there right now.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.616
I'm not talking
about the troops.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.520
I'm talking about the moron
sending them to war.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.393
Moron? You mean
our Commander-in-Chief?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.869
Yeah, whatever you want to call him.
He's still wrong.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.736
How do you know he's wrong?
You're just lashing out.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.548
No, I'm not lashing out. I'm
questioning our government.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.816
That's what we do
in this country.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.195
That is the principle
that we were founded on.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.432
Okay, but how about
questioning the liberal media?

19:16.720 --> 19:20.599
I mean, you're just buying
into what one side is saying.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.039
Maybe I am,
'cause my side is right.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.720
See, that's funny, 'cause my side's right.
Oh, really?

19:26.800 --> 19:29.075
Yeah.
Uh...

19:29.880 --> 19:33.190
Why is it smart conservatives
always make me so mad?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.589
Probably because you don't
like hearing the truth.

19:36.200 --> 19:40.034
You are a very frustrating
individual, you know that?

19:41.800 --> 19:43.950
How am I going
to make you see?

19:44.040 --> 19:46.270
I can see just fine,
thank you.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.148
That help at all?

19:56.520 --> 19:59.034
Nope. No, that did
nothing for me.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.348
Tastes like liberal.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.273
It's not my thing.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.115
Is it constitutional
to bypass the Courts?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.794
No. The Fourth Amendment
prevents searches

20:16.880 --> 20:18.313
and seizures
without a warrant.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.915
That's absolutely right,
Rio. Which means

20:22.760 --> 20:25.558
your Commander-in-Chief, the
President of the United States,

20:25.640 --> 20:27.471
is breaking the law.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.477
That is what you're saying,
isn't it, Rio?

20:30.640 --> 20:35.509
Well, I guess it depends
on who you talk to.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.431
And if you talk
to journalists?

20:38.160 --> 20:41.948
Who, more often than not,
don't have the full picture,

20:42.040 --> 20:45.476
or neglect to report it,
you only get a partial truth.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.913
Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.513
The FISA Court.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.272
We do respect the Fourth
Amendment in this country,

20:57.400 --> 20:58.976
and we issue warrants
based on suspicion.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.358
But sometimes these warrants have
to be issued by secret courts,

21:04.440 --> 21:07.079
so we don't alert
the suspects we're spying on.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.351
And these court proceedings
are classified,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.192
which means, surprise...

21:13.560 --> 21:16.438
They don't appear in papers
such as The New York Times.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.256
Did you see my test scores?

21:19.280 --> 21:22.511
Yes. Top of my class.
Like you. What, here?

21:22.600 --> 21:25.672
NSA. They liked me plenty.

21:25.760 --> 21:30.038
They put me on all the best teams.
Soviet frontier. Desert Storm.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.550
And then
the big new challenge,

21:32.640 --> 21:37.156
find the terrorist in the Internet
haystack. Hell of a haystack.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.673
Hundreds of
terabytes a minute.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.672
I mean, it would take you 400
years to read the emails.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.796
Then you have
to analyze them.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.830
Sometimes, the more you
look, the less you see.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.816
- What'd you come up with?
- Something beautiful.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.229
In house.
For $3 million.

21:52.320 --> 21:56.393
A program that could differentiate
between foreign and domestic,

21:56.480 --> 22:00.109
encrypt every signal we weren't
targeting, so it would remain private.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.430
It was elegant, streamlined.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.351
It was the best
work I ever did.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.069
Have a seat.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.948
What was it called?

22:17.920 --> 22:23.119
Ed, rising to
the top in our world

22:23.200 --> 22:26.556
can sometimes
be hard on a man.

22:26.640 --> 22:30.997
I mean... You think
you're making strides,

22:31.120 --> 22:33.759
you think you're
taking the initiative.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.478
And then, the next minute, they
grind your work out of existence.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.031
They didn't use it?
Why not?

22:40.120 --> 22:42.509
Well,
they never tell you why.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.634
Two years later,
after 9/11,

22:46.760 --> 22:48.034
a friend of mine
tells me about

22:48.120 --> 22:50.918
this new contractor
program they're using.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.434
Costs $4 billion
to deploy.

22:53.520 --> 22:58.469
Modeled after mine but with
no filters, no automation.

22:59.560 --> 23:03.189
Ingested everything.
They were drowning in data.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.918
It was a fucking disaster.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.878
Okay, but there must have been
some bigger picture, right?

23:07.960 --> 23:11.270
I mean, spending that kind of money?
They're not stupid.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.999
You would think intelligence
would count for something

23:14.120 --> 23:15.951
in the intelligence
business.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.436
Right. But you wanna
know what it really is?

23:19.520 --> 23:21.715
What really sets
the agenda?

23:22.720 --> 23:27.111
Military industrial
happiness management.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.031
You keep the coffers
open in Congress,

23:30.120 --> 23:33.271
you keep the money flowing
to the contractors.

23:33.360 --> 23:37.069
Efficiency, results?
They go out the window.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.514
Not to mention...
All right.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.115
Well, you're late
for class.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.631
Okay. Thank you.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.789
Can I take another one?
Sure.

23:57.840 --> 24:00.400
Did you ever say
anything to anybody?

24:00.480 --> 24:04.598
Yeah. I went to legal.
We filed complaints.

24:04.680 --> 24:08.514
Now here I am,
tucked away, teaching you.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.754
Maybe that's more important,
in the long run.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.675
You're getting better.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.516
My favorite spot
on campus.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.599
You hunt, Ed?

24:38.720 --> 24:40.073
Uh...

24:40.920 --> 24:43.480
Did some skeet shooting
with my dad a few times,

24:43.560 --> 24:45.312
but, no,
I never went hunting.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.594
We'll go one day.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.908
That'd be great.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.952
Mr. O'Brian,
can I ask you a question?

24:51.040 --> 24:52.792
How about just
calling me Corbin?

24:53.160 --> 24:56.709
Okay.
Thank you, sir. Uh, Corbin.

24:57.680 --> 25:02.196
I was talking with Hank
Forrester and I wanted to know,

25:02.280 --> 25:06.159
are all of our SIGINT programs
specifically targeted?

25:06.920 --> 25:10.708
Of course. What good would
they be if they weren't? Hmm?

25:12.160 --> 25:13.559
Yeah, I don't know.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.671
You have a girlfriend, Ed?

25:19.880 --> 25:21.518
Uh, nothing serious.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.033
What's her name?
Lindsay.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.155
Lindsay.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.998
She going with you?

25:27.800 --> 25:30.633
No, I wouldn't want
to put her in any danger.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.789
Well, you won't have to.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.276
We're not sending you
to the Middle East.

25:39.600 --> 25:44.116
Sir, I'm your best student.
Doesn't that count for something?

25:44.960 --> 25:49.397
In 20 years, Iraq will be a
hellhole nobody cares about.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.516
Terrorism's
a short-term threat.

25:51.600 --> 25:56.116
The real threats will come
from China, Russia, Iran,

25:56.240 --> 25:59.038
and they'll come as
SQL injections and malware.

25:59.160 --> 26:03.233
Without minds like yours, this country
will be torn apart in cyberspace.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.473
I don't want to risk
losing you

26:05.600 --> 26:08.319
for some horseshit war
over sand and oil.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.837
Sir, I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.276
You don't have to agree with your
politicians to be a patriot.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.788
Sir, where are you sending me?
Take a moment.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.839
Enjoy the view.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.920
Hey.

26:46.640 --> 26:47.834
This is Laura.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.480
Hello.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.039
Hello,
nice to meet you.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.997
Hello, I'm Ewen MacAskill from the
Guardian. It's nice to meet you.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.274
Nice to meet you, too.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.875
Um, if you don't mind, uh,
I'd like to record some of...

26:59.960 --> 27:02.315
Uh... Cell phones go
in the microwave.

27:02.720 --> 27:03.789
Dare I ask why?

27:03.880 --> 27:06.314
We'll get to that.
After you ask your questions.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.469
Yeah, before...

27:08.560 --> 27:10.696
Before we get on to the stories,
I need to know more about you.

27:10.720 --> 27:15.111
Your career by Glenn's account
is very varied,

27:15.200 --> 27:16.872
but the Guardian
needs evidence that...

27:16.960 --> 27:19.997
Yeah. This is my diplomatic
passport for friendly countries,

27:20.080 --> 27:21.957
my tourist passport
for everywhere else.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.439
You can check
the visa stamps.

27:23.520 --> 27:27.559
This is my NSA badge with Booz Allen,
my CIA badge with Dell,

27:27.640 --> 27:30.712
and this is my DIA
instructor's badge.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.712
This is a photo of me
with Michael Hayden,

27:33.880 --> 27:36.713
who's a former head
of the NSA and the CIA.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.155
When can you publish?

27:40.400 --> 27:43.631
Okay, um, do you mind if I sit down?
No, please.

27:43.920 --> 27:48.198
Uh, Glenn says
you want to, uh...

27:48.440 --> 27:50.237
You want to tell people
your identity.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.176
How do you think your
government's going to react?

27:52.200 --> 27:54.589
Well, they'll charge me
under the Espionage Act.

27:54.680 --> 27:57.399
And they'll say I endangered
national security,

27:57.480 --> 28:00.153
and they'll demonize me,
and my friends and family.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.999
And they'll throw me in jail.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.116
That's the
best-case scenario.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.514
And the worst?

28:06.600 --> 28:08.795
Well, if I don't
have any media cover,

28:08.880 --> 28:11.474
then I'll be rendered
by the CIA

28:11.560 --> 28:13.915
and interrogated
outside of the law.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.639
And they have a station
right up the street.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.109
But how would they
know what you did?

28:19.200 --> 28:22.749
Because I left a digital footprint in
my logs, so they'll figure it out.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.796
I did not want
a manhunt.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.030
I know what they would
do to my colleagues.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.153
Look, Mr. MacAskill, uh,

28:31.240 --> 28:34.835
this is not about money
or anything for me.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.148
There's no hidden agenda.

28:36.240 --> 28:40.028
I just wanted to get this data to
established journalists like yourselves,

28:40.120 --> 28:42.350
so that you can present it
to the world,

28:42.440 --> 28:45.955
and the people can decide
either I'm wrong

28:46.960 --> 28:50.873
or there's something going on inside
the government that's really wrong.

28:54.680 --> 28:55.715
So...

28:58.280 --> 29:00.999
This one
is everything I have

29:01.080 --> 29:03.992
on your British
intelligence agency, the GCHQ.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.036
An encryption key
will follow.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.714
You're gonna want your technical
people at the Guardian

29:09.800 --> 29:11.040
to look through
that thoroughly.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.991
There's a lot
of stuff there.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.513
Listen,
they're gonna investigate,

29:17.640 --> 29:20.598
and they're gonna
figure out what I've done.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.791
And then they're
gonna come for me.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.438
And now that
we've made contact,

29:26.200 --> 29:27.997
they're gonna come
for all of you, too.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.754
Uh... Um...

29:37.280 --> 29:38.920
Do you mind if I go
look in the microwave?

29:48.120 --> 29:51.237
Ewen. I'm on with Stuart.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.355
Hi, Ewen.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.316
Hi, Stuart. Look,
I've got one thing to say.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.909
- The Guinness here is great.
- Wonderful.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.116
Oh, absolutely
the genuine article.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.315
Good.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.834
But shockingly different
from what you'd expect.

30:05.400 --> 30:10.633
So... Now we have the lawyers
to deal with. And no doubt the White House.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.440
I got the go ahead.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.794
That's great.
Oh, good.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.696
Let's get started. We have
a lot to go through here,

30:16.720 --> 30:18.039
and it's not easy reading.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.917
We can start
by showing him XKeyscore.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.376
Good idea. Ed, can you bring it
up again and walk us through it?

30:22.400 --> 30:23.469
Yeah.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.231
Do we all get
under there now?

30:32.360 --> 30:34.590
He's protecting his passwords.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.875
Okay. So...

30:41.200 --> 30:43.919
This was introduced

30:44.000 --> 30:48.516
during my first deployment
at the CIA in Geneva.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.715
"XKeyscore."

30:51.280 --> 30:52.599
What does that do?

30:52.920 --> 30:55.753
It's like
a search interface.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.072
What does it search for?

30:59.360 --> 31:00.952
Anything you want.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.997
What was your
assignment in Geneva?

31:04.400 --> 31:09.269
Well, I was assigned with
diplomatic cover to the UN mission

31:09.360 --> 31:11.920
to maintain the CIA's
computer security network.

31:16.200 --> 31:20.193
I spent almost two years
around CIA field officers.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.990
I don't see a time
stamp on any of this.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.639
We have
a confirmation on the GSS.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.674
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't understand.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.320
Sherman says you hacked
the Human Resources site.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.237
Yeah, it's my job
to find flaws.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.994
The security of the HR site
is not your problem.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.638
You went outside
the wheelhouse.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.154
Okay, but just to clarify,
I did not hack it,

31:42.320 --> 31:44.709
I showed that it
could be hacked.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.114
You told me
to find a patch.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.349
You have that
in writing?

31:47.440 --> 31:50.637
Yes, I do. Remember, I sent
you the proof of concept.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.056
Doesn't matter
what you did, Snowden.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.880
Right or wrong, you need to let these
things be someone else's problem.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.592
He's also put
a derog in your file.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.079
Excuse me?
Let that be a lesson.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.513
I don't want him
calling me again

32:02.600 --> 32:04.318
about another
Ed Snowden moment.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.799
Okay?

32:10.160 --> 32:11.896
Why don't you take it easy
the rest of the day?

32:11.920 --> 32:13.751
Go work on
the scrubbing pile.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.352
That didn't look
like it went well.

32:21.440 --> 32:26.719
Oh, hey, man. Uh, yeah. No, I just
got a derog for doing my job.

32:26.840 --> 32:30.389
Politics, man. The
culture of fear wins again.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.875
I can't get anything done here.
Yeah.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.949
Hey, um, what about that idea
that we were talking about?

32:37.040 --> 32:38.696
I'm working on it.
I'm waiting for a call back

32:38.720 --> 32:40.199
from our friend
at The Hill.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.992
Who, Corbin? You called Corbin?
Hmm.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.433
You think he can
do something?

32:43.520 --> 32:46.512
We'll see. Maybe some limited
field ops under my supervision.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.176
Yes, that would be amazing.
I would love...

32:48.200 --> 32:51.954
Easy, Ed. I've gotta see a cleric in Milan.
We'll talk after.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.871
Okay. Thank you.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.789
Damn, CIA does not like
to leave a trace, huh?

33:14.880 --> 33:15.880
Can I help you?

33:15.960 --> 33:17.678
You get curious
to check one out?

33:18.160 --> 33:20.276
See what kind of crazy-ass
covert kill mission

33:20.360 --> 33:21.536
you might be erasing
from history?

33:21.560 --> 33:22.640
I'm sorry,
who are you with?

33:22.920 --> 33:25.434
No Such Agency.
I'm Gabriel Sol.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.836
I'm the 50-pound brain from the
Council of Wizards and Warlocks.

33:29.480 --> 33:30.629
Excuse me?

33:30.720 --> 33:32.915
Giving you your intel for
Bucharest, dude. Oh.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.911
Unless there's
another Dave Churchyard.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.639
No. That's me.
Right this way.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.269
I'll be right outside.
Stay if you want.

33:44.360 --> 33:48.876
Uh, I don't have
authorization to use NSA programs.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.096
Well, if you're
the messenger to Bucharest,

33:50.120 --> 33:51.519
you must have
a PRIVAC clearance

33:51.600 --> 33:53.238
to see the finished
intel, yes?

33:54.080 --> 33:55.080
Yeah...

33:55.120 --> 33:56.336
Yeah, so what
difference does it make

33:56.360 --> 33:57.640
if you see how
it's put together?

34:00.240 --> 34:01.798
Well, it's up to you, man.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.315
Uh, you're giving me
just names?

34:09.440 --> 34:10.953
Uh, and a lot more
than names.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.437
What I will be providing you and the
fine gentlemen of the Secret Service

34:14.520 --> 34:19.389
is a list of every threat made about
the President since February 3rd.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.947
And a profile of
every threat-maker.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.873
And these are, like,
existing targets?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.150
99% are gonna come from the
bulk collection program, so...

34:30.320 --> 34:32.117
Upstream, Muscular,
Tempora, PRISM.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
PRISM?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.831
You got a little
Snow White in you.

34:38.960 --> 34:42.190
Which makes me feel like the witch
bringing you a poisoned apple.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.589
Here. Exhibit A.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.877
Oakland resident Justin Pinsky
posted on a message board,

34:47.960 --> 34:50.713
"Romania has a storied history
of executing their leaders,

34:50.800 --> 34:53.632
"couldn't they do us a solid
and take out Bush?"

34:54.760 --> 34:57.513
Now this looks juicy.
This is from a G-chat.

34:59.360 --> 35:02.830
"...with the biggest python
you've ever seen." Hmm.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.351
How is this all possible?

35:06.440 --> 35:08.431
Um, keyword selectors.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.670
"Attack," "take out Bush."

35:12.480 --> 35:14.038
So think of it as
a Google search,

35:14.120 --> 35:16.136
except instead of searching
only what people make public,

35:16.160 --> 35:18.355
we're also looking at
everything they don't. So...

35:18.880 --> 35:20.757
Emails, chats,
SMS, whatever.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.512
Yeah, but which people?

35:23.800 --> 35:25.552
The whole kingdom,
Snow White.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.472
Which ambassador
was he again?

35:34.560 --> 35:37.120
De La Hoya, with
World Trade Organization.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.315
Right.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.160
So...

35:53.920 --> 35:55.592
O'Brian came through
for you.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.389
He agrees your talents are being wasted.
You ready for a little action?

36:00.200 --> 36:02.760
Really? What,
you mean right here?

36:03.240 --> 36:05.151
Yeah. Now.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.310
See the woman in
the pink number?

36:07.400 --> 36:12.155
Credit Suisse. J.P. Morgan's on her arm.
Grandma's with Deutsche Bank.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.071
Ten thousand bankers
in this town.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.071
All you need to turn is one.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.272
Socialize. Meet a few.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.079
Preferably ones sitting on
a pile of dirty Saudi money

36:21.160 --> 36:22.559
that's funding bin Laden.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.911
Thank you very much. Church.
Church. Sure. Churchyard.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.519
Mr. Debrinin asks
your business card, please.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.269
An ambassador. Wow!

36:39.480 --> 36:41.357
I wish I had your
schmoozing skills.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.271
Uh, well,
that's why you have me.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.119
Yeah. You don't know any
bankers, do you? Bankers?

36:46.960 --> 36:49.428
Are you on some kind of
assignment or something?

36:50.960 --> 36:55.238
Um, "Relationship cultivating."
And not well.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.034
Let me help you.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.235
No.
Yeah.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.829
No, this is serious.
I know it's serious.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.160
Trust me.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.474
Any luck?

37:06.800 --> 37:07.994
No, no bites.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.829
Is there some kind
of trick to it?

37:12.560 --> 37:14.790
It's all about finding
the pressure point.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.956
Everything else is
just pushing on it.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.158
Looks like
you're being summoned.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.680
...we have to pay extra...
Marwan? May I interrupt?

37:28.760 --> 37:29.909
This is
my boyfriend, Dave.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.514
Hello, Dave. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.669
Marwan works at Monfort.

37:34.760 --> 37:37.228
We were talking,
and after last week,

37:37.320 --> 37:39.117
he may be able
to give you some tips.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.760
Gentlemen, I'll see you inside.
Last week?

37:43.440 --> 37:46.671
He's embarrassed. It was
a lot of money for us.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.230
Day trading is a perilous sport.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.715
You shouldn't be ashamed of it.
Yeah.

37:54.440 --> 37:57.113
I'm gonna grab some food.
See you guys inside?

37:57.200 --> 37:58.315
Sure.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.468
You have a lovely girlfriend.
Thank you so much.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.556
You know, I work in IT,
and so I just figured

38:05.720 --> 38:08.393
I could crack the market
like a weak network.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.592
May I ask, how precipitous
were your losses?

38:12.840 --> 38:15.479
Well, I told Lindsay
it was 20,000,

38:15.560 --> 38:18.393
but between you and me,
it was closer to 45.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.636
Tried to recoup,
but that was a mistake,

38:22.720 --> 38:24.312
and now without
any real grounding,

38:24.400 --> 38:26.016
I feel like I'm just
sliding out of control.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.917
Oh, I have seen it
many times.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.797
And I'm always happy
to help a man

38:29.880 --> 38:32.155
break a bad habit
before it gets going.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.071
Oh, thank you.
I really appreciate that.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.153
This is the cleanest
Pakistani I've ever seen.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.390
We got no first-degree ties
to government or ISI,

38:41.480 --> 38:42.913
no shady family.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.736
I mean, second-degree contacts
are off the charts,

38:45.760 --> 38:47.376
but that's... I mean, that's
everyone in the Middle East

38:47.400 --> 38:48.674
with a six-figure income.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.514
Well, it's not dirt that we need
necessarily, it's a pressure point.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.757
Something intimate,
some kind of weakness.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.111
Can we look through his family?
Mmm-hmm.

38:59.840 --> 39:03.594
How about
his sister-in-law?

39:04.880 --> 39:05.915
Yeah.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.796
What is that, is that some
video that she sent somebody?

39:11.880 --> 39:14.269
No, this is live.
Out of Paris.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.754
What do you mean, live?

39:16.600 --> 39:19.558
Optic Nerve. It's
camera and mic activation.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.760
I wish we could take credit,
but the Brits wrote it.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.153
Activation?

39:23.240 --> 39:25.151
Yeah,
her laptop's off.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.878
Or was, she just
forgot to close it.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.056
Of course,
how would she know?

39:28.080 --> 39:30.594
This shit is so sly, the webcam
light doesn't even turn on.

39:38.160 --> 39:41.197
Hmm. I always wondered
what was under those.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.194
Okay, look, let's stick
to family in Geneva.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.714
All right?

39:52.800 --> 39:54.791
Okay, Snow White.
Uh...

39:55.640 --> 39:58.313
Fifteen-year-old daughter
at the International School.

39:58.400 --> 40:02.712
Yeah. Uh, Facebook?
Is that possible?

40:02.800 --> 40:04.472
Dude,
Facebook's my bitch.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.039
Seriously?

40:06.320 --> 40:09.471
Like, she fights
with her parents, or...

40:09.560 --> 40:12.870
Don't worry, don't worry. I know all
the hooks for this kind of fishing.

40:13.480 --> 40:17.314
Uh, query name. So email, keyword,
whatever selector you want.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.151
And justification
is where I write...

40:23.440 --> 40:26.557
In other words, turning your
daddy into a CIA informant.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.796
- Wait, that's it?
- That's it, bro.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.478
You don't have to get
a FISA court order?

40:32.920 --> 40:35.434
Mmm-mmm. No, not here.
XKeyscore's under 702 authority,

40:35.520 --> 40:37.351
which means no warrants.

40:37.600 --> 40:41.115
Okay, but U.S. targets then, you'd
have to get the court order?

40:41.200 --> 40:44.715
You mean FISA? Yeah, they're just
a big-ass rubber stamp, dude.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.472
I mean, FISA judges
are all appointed by

40:46.560 --> 40:49.154
the Chief Justice,
who's like, you know...

40:50.480 --> 40:53.233
Darth Vader when it comes
to national security. Boom.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.193
Here we go.

40:57.240 --> 41:02.678
Okay, okay. And the boy
at third base is...

41:04.880 --> 41:10.034
Nadim. Okay. He's 18.

41:11.360 --> 41:12.496
Salma says she wants
to marry him,

41:12.520 --> 41:14.317
but is scared of
telling her parents.

41:14.480 --> 41:19.713
What she doesn't know is that
his other name is Nicolas.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.555
And he's currently banging
Geraldine and Julie.

41:25.600 --> 41:26.669
And...

41:31.520 --> 41:33.590
He and his Turkish mother
are here illegally.

41:38.920 --> 41:39.955
That's it.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.516
Ah, you like that?

41:50.600 --> 41:52.113
I love these.

41:55.400 --> 41:56.913
Man, what are
we doing here?

41:57.440 --> 41:59.795
You're making people
very happy.

41:59.880 --> 42:02.394
Mr. Marwan's bank
handles serious Saudi money,

42:02.480 --> 42:04.755
and a whole bunch of
Russian billionaires.

42:04.840 --> 42:09.072
What about any al-Qaeda money?
Anything promising?

42:10.440 --> 42:12.670
Ed, I'm up for
a promotion soon.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.631
I will not forget
my friends.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.759
Thank you.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.416
This is all going kind of
fast though, right?

42:18.440 --> 42:20.351
I mean, I just sent
some initial background.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.590
There he is!
The man!

42:22.680 --> 42:23.908
Hey, Marwan!

42:24.000 --> 42:27.151
Dave. How wonderful
to see you.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.514
Good to see you, too.

42:28.640 --> 42:33.430
Uh, I was counting, Marwan, you snuck
in an extra half hour back there.

42:33.520 --> 42:37.354
I'm afraid she was merely
listening to an old man's woes.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.440
Oh, I see.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.351
So, how are you,
Marwan?

42:42.600 --> 42:46.036
I must tell you,
Dave, since we met,

42:46.800 --> 42:49.997
my life has gone
somewhat topsy-turvy.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.151
Oh, no,
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:53.640 --> 42:55.232
But your colleague
Charles here

42:55.320 --> 42:57.515
has graciously
offered his help.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.909
So I owe him and you
a great deal.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.718
Can I ask
what happened?

43:03.320 --> 43:05.914
My daughter had an...

43:06.000 --> 43:08.958
Marwan's daughter
took too many sleeping pills.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.632
She's all right.

43:10.720 --> 43:13.632
It had something to do with her
boyfriend, who was recently deported.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.631
We're trying to secure
a visa for him.

43:15.720 --> 43:19.190
And even so,
I'm afraid that Salma will...

43:21.200 --> 43:23.589
I'm sorry. I won't trouble
you with such matters.

43:23.680 --> 43:27.514
No, no, you... Hey. You
talk as much as you want.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.273
All right?
Family comes first.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.148
Whoa!
Oh!

43:43.040 --> 43:44.234
There's my beauty.

43:46.400 --> 43:48.152
I'm never
like this before.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.071
Oh, sure.
No, of course.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.310
You sit down, huh?
Sit tight.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.873
You sit tight.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.473
What the fuck's
going on?

44:00.560 --> 44:02.516
I have been acting
swiftly and effectively

44:02.600 --> 44:05.637
on the very good signals
intelligence you've provided.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.155
And if his daughter
had died?

44:08.240 --> 44:09.992
We could have
used that too.

44:10.080 --> 44:12.150
Are you serious? What, in
the name of a promotion?

44:15.240 --> 44:18.676
Marwan can't be away
from his family right now.

44:18.800 --> 44:20.995
So in the morning, when
he's facing a week in jail,

44:21.080 --> 44:24.152
we're going to offer him a deal
and he won't turn it down.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.389
Wait, jail? For what?

44:26.400 --> 44:27.549
Drunk driving.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.995
Now, I want you
to call the police.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.376
Tell 'em you saw
a Mercedes headed north...

44:31.400 --> 44:32.628
No, he's not driving
right now.

44:32.720 --> 44:34.517
Look at him,
he'll kill himself.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.431
Okay. I'll call 'em.
Hey!

44:40.920 --> 44:42.069
He's not driving.

44:43.120 --> 44:46.908
Remind me, are you authorized on
any of the NSA programs you used?

44:49.280 --> 44:51.400
So we're both doing a little
fucked up shit here, huh?

44:52.720 --> 44:55.075
Watch yourself, Ed.
I will tell him who you are.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.353
You reveal the identity
of an undercover officer,

44:59.440 --> 45:02.113
you're going to jail
for a lot longer than Marwan.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.440
Hey!

45:23.160 --> 45:24.275
Hey.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.159
Sorry I'm so late.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.279
How was work?

45:32.760 --> 45:34.079
It was, uh...

45:35.840 --> 45:38.149
It was all right. Yeah.

45:39.560 --> 45:42.791
I have to
wake up in, like, three hours.

45:42.880 --> 45:44.313
My flight's at 7:00.

45:47.680 --> 45:49.636
Well, we'd better
be quick, then.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.836
I will provide our intelligence
and law enforcement agencies

46:38.920 --> 46:41.718
with the tools they need to track
and take out the terrorists

46:41.840 --> 46:44.798
without undermining our
constitution and our freedom.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.536
That means no
more illegal wiretapping

46:47.560 --> 46:48.788
of American citizens.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.156
No more ignoring the law
when it is inconvenient.

46:52.240 --> 46:53.639
That is not who we are.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.308
Hey, hon.
Hey.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.518
What happened
to the London trip?

46:58.640 --> 47:00.471
Uh...

47:00.960 --> 47:02.393
Turns out I'm not going.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.509
Oh.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.031
What's going on?
Who's winning?

47:08.120 --> 47:10.256
...and Michelle Obama
voted this morning in Chicago.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.720
- I voted.
- In Arizona...

47:11.920 --> 47:13.035
Still early.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.336
...John and Cindy McCain voted,
and then they landed in Colorado

47:15.360 --> 47:17.157
to defend a traditionally
Republican state

47:17.240 --> 47:18.673
that has turned
into a battleground.

47:18.760 --> 47:19.760
Hey. Let's see.

47:20.200 --> 47:23.397
Obama ahead 67% to 32%...

47:23.480 --> 47:26.597
Come on, big ears.
Check out Florida.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.876
Holy shit, he's gonna win it!

47:34.280 --> 47:36.350
What, Florida?
Yeah!

47:36.440 --> 47:38.431
That's big. Yeah.
It's huge!

47:40.120 --> 47:43.510
You can act all nonchalant, but I know
you were starting to root for him.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.311
I've been watching
your inner liberal grow.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.600
For which I will take a modest
percentage of the credit.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.676
And you deserve it.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.275
What is this?

47:55.360 --> 47:56.588
...in Missouri.

47:56.760 --> 47:59.354
56% for McCain,
43% for Obama.

47:59.480 --> 48:02.950
Oh, yeah, that. Just... Leave that there.
That's, uh...

48:04.480 --> 48:07.040
Russian hackers.
The Agency says

48:07.120 --> 48:09.680
they can activate
webcams now. So...

48:09.760 --> 48:10.760
That's creepy.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.070
Yes. It's really
bothering me.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.800
Whatever. It's not a big deal.
You shouldn't let it bother you.

48:16.840 --> 48:18.558
It's not a big deal? No.

48:18.640 --> 48:20.995
What, that someone could
be watching you right now?

48:21.600 --> 48:24.273
No, I'm not
hiding anything.

48:25.400 --> 48:28.995
That's such
a bullshit line. What is?

48:29.120 --> 48:31.509
I have nothing to hide.
I don't.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.794
Everyone does.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.869
Okay, well then,
what do I have to hide?

48:36.640 --> 48:38.710
Forget it. No,
what do I have to hide?

48:38.800 --> 48:40.631
No, never...
Let's just drop it.

48:40.720 --> 48:44.030
Well, apparently you think that I'm
hiding something, so...

48:44.120 --> 48:46.554
Okay, the other day,
your computer was open,

48:46.640 --> 48:49.438
and I happened to notice you
were on the site where we met,

48:49.520 --> 48:50.816
and you were looking
at other guys.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.990
You just were looking
at my computer?

48:53.840 --> 48:55.216
I wouldn't have
even brought this up.

48:55.240 --> 48:57.231
You asked me,
"What do I have to hide?"

48:57.320 --> 48:59.311
That's something
you're not telling me.

49:01.200 --> 49:05.751
Well, it's not...
I don't do anything,

49:05.880 --> 49:08.075
I don't meet any
of those people.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.798
You're gone for weeks
at a time.

49:12.920 --> 49:15.354
So it's like I'm peering
into other peoples' lives

49:15.480 --> 49:17.471
because my own is
just temporarily on hold.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.039
That sounds like
an excuse.

49:21.160 --> 49:22.354
It's the truth.

49:38.840 --> 49:42.355
I should have told you.
And I didn't.

49:42.440 --> 49:46.069
I'm really sorry.
But it's not a big deal.

49:50.920 --> 49:51.920
Hey.

50:01.080 --> 50:04.629
Look at me.
I don't want anyone else.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.152
I don't want
any other life.

50:09.760 --> 50:10.795
Okay?

50:25.520 --> 50:26.953
Listen, uh...

50:29.200 --> 50:32.510
I didn't go to London today
'cause I resigned.

50:34.680 --> 50:35.749
What?

50:36.160 --> 50:37.991
It was personal differences,

50:38.080 --> 50:40.150
and it was a matter
of principle.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.872
Can you tell me
anything else?

50:46.600 --> 50:47.919
Do you get
reposted, or...

50:48.000 --> 50:50.639
No, no, I resigned
from the CIA.

50:52.160 --> 50:54.151
So what does
that mean? What do we do?

50:54.280 --> 50:57.670
I don't know. I'll figure
it out, but listen, I...

51:00.240 --> 51:03.596
This is a good thing.
Trust me.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.474
I do.

51:20.200 --> 51:21.838
Hey.
Hmm?

51:22.280 --> 51:23.429
He's gonna win.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.656
52% for Obama,
48% for McCain.

51:26.680 --> 51:27.874
Yeah, he'd better.

51:29.160 --> 51:33.073
CNN can now project that
Barack Obama, 47 years old,

51:33.160 --> 51:35.879
will become the President of the
United States.

51:36.480 --> 51:39.950
Every agency and department
should know that this administration

51:40.040 --> 51:41.314
stands on the side

51:41.400 --> 51:43.516
not of those who seek
to withhold information,

51:43.600 --> 51:45.431
but those who seek
to make it known.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.951
Janine is
the website editor

51:50.040 --> 51:52.998
of a small stateside office
of a British newspaper,

51:53.080 --> 51:55.594
up against the most powerful
government in the world.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.954
She won't be bullied.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.396
We need to establish
that we're not compromising

51:59.480 --> 52:01.311
national security
by publishing.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.958
We need
to have alternatives.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.359
Listen, Ed,

52:04.440 --> 52:06.829
the real issue here is that
they, the White House,

52:06.920 --> 52:10.196
are aware that Janine has a leaked
top secret FISA court order.

52:10.280 --> 52:11.474
Anything could happen.

52:11.560 --> 52:12.959
They could subpoena
the Guardian

52:13.040 --> 52:14.176
and, for that matter,
they could

52:14.200 --> 52:15.560
break through
that door any minute,

52:15.640 --> 52:17.596
ending all of this.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.875
We are running
out of time.

52:19.960 --> 52:23.032
We seriously have to think about
doing this on our own website.

52:23.160 --> 52:24.434
We have no choice.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.317
Wait, you can't just
start dumping articles

52:26.440 --> 52:28.237
on the Internet, Glenn!
Be serious.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.993
Look at WikiLeaks.
It destroyed their credibility.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.638
Look, Ed,
you said it yourself,

52:32.720 --> 52:36.156
if this isn't done properly,
the world isn't gonna take notice.

52:36.240 --> 52:39.596
You need experienced
journalists to lead the public

52:39.680 --> 52:42.148
through some very,
very complicated stories.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.753
We are
experienced journalists.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.673
My feeling...

52:52.960 --> 52:56.157
Has anyone called here before?
Not once. Not in three weeks.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.832
Well, I'll...
Shall I answer it?

52:57.960 --> 52:59.598
I'll tell 'em it's
the wrong number.

53:01.280 --> 53:02.429
Yes?

53:03.920 --> 53:05.353
No, I don't.

53:06.960 --> 53:08.439
Okay. Thank you.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.191
Asking if I want
turndown service.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.748
She said the "Do not disturb"
sign was off the door.

53:33.880 --> 53:35.029
So?

53:36.240 --> 53:39.312
Do we wait?
Or go on our own?

53:41.040 --> 53:42.240
Look, I said
from the beginning

53:42.320 --> 53:45.312
that how you publish
is your business,

53:45.400 --> 53:47.152
and I trust you.

53:47.240 --> 53:49.959
The only thing I ask is you study
the data, you be responsible,

53:50.080 --> 53:52.719
no names, no specifics,
anything ongoing

53:52.800 --> 53:54.950
that's critical,
you don't release.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.429
You just stick to the issue
of mass surveillance

53:57.520 --> 53:58.560
and let the people decide.

53:58.640 --> 54:01.800
You have our word on that, but
that's not the question. We have to ask...

54:01.840 --> 54:03.478
Look, Ed, Ed,

54:03.560 --> 54:05.949
right now the White House is
arranging a conference call

54:06.040 --> 54:08.110
between Janine and
the intelligence services.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.272
Now that's gonna happen
in a few hours.

54:11.360 --> 54:15.239
Let's at least wait for that,
see what they say to her.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.876
I'd say we pause a moment.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.616
Yeah, I think
we should reassemble

54:24.640 --> 54:26.176
in this room after
the call takes place,

54:26.200 --> 54:29.829
so that's around midnight.
Be noon in New York.

54:30.600 --> 54:32.113
All right.

54:32.200 --> 54:34.509
I'll take another pass at the
PRISM story in the meantime.

54:34.600 --> 54:38.479
Okay. We'll be in our hotel
room if you need us, okay?

54:38.560 --> 54:39.560
Thanks, Ewen.

54:39.640 --> 54:40.789
Yeah.
Okay.

54:48.400 --> 54:51.198
Uh, do you mind maybe
we take a break from that?

54:51.520 --> 54:53.078
For a second?

54:54.360 --> 54:56.669
Oh, yeah. Sure, sorry.

54:56.840 --> 55:00.196
You wanna take a look?
Might make you feel better.

55:00.400 --> 55:03.039
Oh. It's not
recording, just on standby.

55:03.120 --> 55:04.473
Okay.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.475
When did this start for you?
Not wanting your photo taken?

55:10.760 --> 55:13.149
Uh, probably in Japan.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.708
I remember every time
a camera got pointed at me,

55:15.800 --> 55:18.155
it was like...
Couldn't breathe.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.593
Why was that?

55:21.080 --> 55:25.437
I probably, uh, spent too much time
looking at other people through cameras.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.869
Japan was your
first NSA job, right?

55:28.960 --> 55:33.909
Yeah, well, as a contractor with Dell.
Had a lot of access.

55:34.400 --> 55:36.391
Why'd you go
back after Geneva?

55:39.520 --> 55:43.149
'Cause the money, and 'cause
I wanted to live in Japan.

55:43.240 --> 55:44.992
And because of Obama,
actually.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.719
You know, I thought things were
gonna get better with him.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.479
I was wrong.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.200
What was it like there?

56:00.280 --> 56:02.236
Well,
in the first part of my day,

56:02.320 --> 56:06.518
I was building this round-the-clock
backup system called Epic Shelter.

56:06.600 --> 56:09.114
So, if there was
some catastrophe,

56:09.200 --> 56:12.078
say, uh, terrorists
burned down every embassy

56:12.160 --> 56:14.720
and NSA post in
the Middle East.

56:14.800 --> 56:19.476
This program would ensure we
wouldn't lose any of that data.

56:19.800 --> 56:23.554
But then, I would have to put it
aside when visitors would show up.

56:23.640 --> 56:24.640
Hi, Ed.

56:24.720 --> 56:29.510
NSA wanted to impress the
Japanese, show them our reach.

56:30.480 --> 56:33.233
They loved
the live drone feeds.

56:33.320 --> 56:35.470
This is over Pakistan.

56:36.400 --> 56:37.719
Right now.

56:40.480 --> 56:43.995
They were not as thrilled to
learn that we wanted them to help us

56:44.080 --> 56:46.196
spy on
the Japanese population.

56:47.320 --> 56:50.073
They said it was
against their laws.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.390
Course we tapped
the entire country anyway.

56:54.360 --> 56:56.316
And we didn't stop there,

56:56.400 --> 56:58.550
'cause once we owned
their communications systems,

56:58.640 --> 57:01.552
we started going after
their physical infrastructure.

57:01.640 --> 57:05.918
We'd slip these little sleeper
programs into power grids,

57:06.000 --> 57:07.956
dams, hospitals,

57:08.040 --> 57:10.110
and the idea was
if the day came

57:10.200 --> 57:12.589
when Japan was
no longer an ally,

57:12.680 --> 57:13.999
it'd be lights out.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.474
And it wasn't
just the Japanese.

57:18.560 --> 57:22.075
We were planting malware
in Mexico, Germany,

57:22.160 --> 57:23.832
Brazil, Austria.

57:25.400 --> 57:28.915
I mean, China I can understand,
or Russia, or Iran,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.673
or Venezuela, okay.
But Austria?

57:33.440 --> 57:36.477
You're also being ordered
to follow most world leaders

57:36.560 --> 57:38.152
and heads of industry.

57:38.240 --> 57:41.550
You know, you're tracking
trade deals, sex scandals,

57:41.880 --> 57:44.553
diplomatic cables
to give the U. S.

57:44.640 --> 57:47.108
An advantage in
negotiations at the G8,

57:47.200 --> 57:50.795
or leverage over
Brazilian oil companies,

57:50.880 --> 57:55.032
or helping to oust some third-world
leader who's not playing ball.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.630
And ultimately,
the truth sinks in

57:58.720 --> 58:01.553
that no matter what justification
you're selling yourself,

58:01.640 --> 58:03.915
this is not about terrorism.

58:05.480 --> 58:07.277
Terrorism is the excuse.

58:10.240 --> 58:14.950
This is about economic
and social control.

58:16.560 --> 58:19.074
And the only thing
you're really protecting

58:19.160 --> 58:21.549
is the supremacy
of your government.

58:30.840 --> 58:33.991
Were you thinking about
going to journalists then?

58:34.080 --> 58:37.038
No. No, that wouldn't have
occurred to me back then.

58:38.640 --> 58:42.679
I just thought, you know,
the system will self-correct,

58:42.760 --> 58:46.275
and the President will keep his
promise that got him elected...

58:48.440 --> 58:52.194
That's actually when I first started
reading about you and your films.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.349
It was in Glenn's blog.

58:53.440 --> 58:56.512
You were being detained
in airports for hours.

58:56.600 --> 59:00.434
Thirty-seven times. For investigating
your own country's wars.

59:00.640 --> 59:05.111
That's why I'm going back to Berlin
to edit. You can trust me with this.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.790
I do. Yeah.

59:08.960 --> 59:12.714
I haven't trusted
anyone in years.

59:15.960 --> 59:21.557
It was a welcome change when they
put me on terrorism watch duty.

59:22.240 --> 59:25.915
Every day, I'd go in and I'd get
starting points for SIGINT,

59:26.040 --> 59:28.634
which is signals intelligence.

59:30.160 --> 59:33.914
A lot of them were American,
which felt strange,

59:34.000 --> 59:35.831
but you just keep
reminding yourself,

59:35.920 --> 59:39.913
I could stop a dirty bomb attack
and save thousands of lives.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.950
The thing is, you're not just
following your bad guy targets.

59:44.040 --> 59:46.600
You're also following
their metadata,

59:46.680 --> 59:50.673
which is basically all the phone
numbers that they're in touch with.

59:51.600 --> 59:55.309
Let's say your target
is a shady Iranian banker

59:55.400 --> 59:57.914
operating out of Beirut,
okay.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.434
So you're watching his stuff,
but you're also watching

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.954
all the people
that he talks to.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.634
Including,
you know, his cousin,

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.280
who's just some dentist
living in Buffalo.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.158
And then you have to watch
all of that guy's contacts.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.596
And by the time you go a third hop
out from the original target,

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:20.198
you're watching this bartender
chat with her mother about Botox.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.274
'Cause three hops from anyone
with, say, 40 contacts,

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.999
you're looking at a list
of 2. 5 million people.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.676
And there's that
moment when

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.355
you're sitting there and
the scale of it hits you.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:41.116
The NSA is really tracking
every cell phone in the world.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.037
No matter who you are,

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.799
every day of your life,
you're sitting in a database

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.474
just ready
to be looked at.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.672
And not just terrorists, or
countries, or corporations, but you.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.276
Was Lindsay with you
in Japan?

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.675
Japan was difficult
for us.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.636
I guess you couldn't
talk about your work.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.319
No.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.549
There was this one night,
uh, towards the end,

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.158
when, uh, we were supposed to go
climb Mount Fuji the next day...

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.480
Wow!

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.868
Are you gonna
post that on Twitter?

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.960
No.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.714
They're just for me.
What do you think?

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.231
You should delete those.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.079
That's not quite the artistic
critique I was going for.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.032
I'm sorry. You just...
You should...

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.976
You can't have stuff like
that on your hard drive.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.035
Yes, I can.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:10.079
Can you just please... I'm
asking you, can you delete them?

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.159
Russian hackers again?

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.275
No...

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.159
Is it us?

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.075
It's classified.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.868
Am I a target?

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.188
Of course not.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.755
Clearly someone is looking
at my nude portraits.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.717
Okay. I shouldn't
have brought it up.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.109
All right? It's issues
of national security.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.350
Well, I am flattered
that my boobs

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.311
are considered an issue
of national security,

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.176
but you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.668
I'd rather not talk about stuff
that could land us in jail.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.576
So that's what
the Band-Aids are about, then?

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.431
And your camera phobia?

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.714
Because of work?

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.113
Are they watching us?

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.478
Who are they watching?
No one, okay?

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.198
Let's just stop
talking about it.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.949
Let's go to bed,
and wake up in the morning,

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.635
and go climb this fucking mountain.
All right?

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.176
Of course we're not
gonna talk about it.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.474
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.028
It means that we don't talk
about anything anymore.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.354
You work 12-hour days,
you come home depressed,

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.795
you play fucking video games,
and then you fall asleep.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.552
Yeah, I'm tired
'cause I have a job.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.039
That's what pays
for this apartment

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.838
in the most expensive city
in the world.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:24.151
Which you asked me to come to knowing
that I did not have a work visa.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.468
Okay, what if
you had one?

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.075
Would you really give up your
beautiful life of eating and sleeping

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.760
and going out all the time? You
think you'd really want a career?

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.156
A career like yours? Where I'm
miserable all the time? No.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.390
That's called
responsibility.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.150
Fuck this.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.071
You know what?
You have no fucking idea

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.833
what it's like to be accountable
for other people's lives,

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.990
because you live
in a fairy tale land

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.991
where just there
are no consequences,

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.672
and no one ever gets hurt.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.071
No. No,
you, you don't get hurt.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.919
I get
fucking crushed.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.837
Fucking bullshit!
I've done nothing to you!

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.876
That's exactly right.
You have done nothing!

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.990
You don't hang out with me,
you don't laugh with me,

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.913
you don't even
fucking touch me anymore.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.388
I'm sorry.
Stop!

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.632
No!

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.115
We, uh, never made it to Mount Fuji.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.269
And Lindsay left pretty
soon after that, and...

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.518
I was really lonely there.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.480
But after three months, I left too.
I went back to Maryland.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.232
And I promised her
I'd change.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.071
And, uh, we moved
back in together.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.576
Make
sure your knees stay bent,

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.512
and then you can fully extend
once you feel stable. Ready?

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.636
One, two, three.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.320
All the way up.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.976
Now you wanna clench
between your knees.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.434
It'll burn,
but it's a good burn.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520
Perfect.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.993
Twirl around.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.830
Perfect! Oh, my
God, I'm so proud of you!

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.751
When you're really happy,

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.196
there's a large part of you
that just wants to stay happy.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.511
And you start to think, what could
be more important than this?

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.193
What!
Is it okay?

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.036
Oh, my God.
It's so beautiful.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.633
You know, lots of people
cruise happily through life.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.719
Why can't I?

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.278
And I went back
to work at the CIA.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.032
With backdoors...

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.873
My official title was
Solutions Consultant.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.037
Basically I was hawking
overpriced hardware for a living.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.792
But I thought
you had resigned?

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.348
Yeah, well, it was all
contract work after Geneva.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.670
You know,
it's Booz Allen Hamilton,

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.876
or Dell, in partnership

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.997
with CIA or NSA, DIA.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.633
That's the intelligence
community's revolving door.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.628
How was it?
Being back in the States?

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.669
It was, uh, it was
really good to be home.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.118
But Maryland was where things
started to turn for me.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:58.556
Every time I felt like I was finally
letting go of all the anxiety

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.234
and all the questions that
used to keep me up at night,

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.233
I'd learn something else,
and I just couldn't ignore it.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.228
Like, there were these three
high-level officials at the NSA,

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.039
Bill Binney, Ed Loomis,
and Kirk Wiebe.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:16.318
They'd been filing complaints about
abuse and overreach for years.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.188
That's all they did,
they just filed complaints,

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.431
and the FBI
raided their homes.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.073
Then there was Thomas Drake.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.116
Like the other three guys,
Drake was trying

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.475
to change things
from the inside.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.949
But when nothing worked,
he did go to the press.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.953
So they hit him with the Espionage
Act, and we were shocked.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.951
The whole intel community.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.416
Why do you
think you were charged?

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.953
To send a chilling message.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.360
To whom?

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:45.000
To other whistleblowers,
to others in the government,

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.190
not to speak out.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.319
Do not tell truth to power.
We'll hammer you.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.559
There's a new
program being developed

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.995
at the NSA's op
center on Oahu.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.549
You'd be going up against
Chinese cyber divisions.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.989
You interested?

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.916
Won't be the vast sums of
money you're making now,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.468
but you'd be performing a critical
service for your country.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.879
I know that's
important to you.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.269
You mean service
like in Geneva?

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.193
Matt was a mistake. Shouldn't
have pushed you into that.

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:21.319
You didn't push me
into it.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.515
I asked for exposure to field
ops, you gave it to me.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.318
I won't hold that
against you.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.828
Is there something
you do hold against me?

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.240
You didn't tell me
we were running

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:37.510
a dragnet on
the whole world, Corbin.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.388
Great shooting, Ed.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:03.799
Thank you.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.837
That's terrific.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:08.709
It's the one thing
in the Army I was good at.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.438
You ever think, Ed,

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.354
since the Second World War,
it's been 60 years and still no WW III.

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:23.395
Why?

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:28.313
Because we've used our power
generally for the good of the world.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.917
For prosperity, order.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.877
How can we defend
ourselves against

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.157
nuclear war, terror attacks,
cyber-attacks

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.629
without a centralized
intel factory

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.596
working around the world
night and day?

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:45.233
So we should catalogue
billions of people's lives?

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:48.676
Most people already catalogue
their lives for public consumption.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.911
Well, they catalogue part of their lives,
and they do it by choice.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.496
We're not giving them the choice.
We're just taking everything.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.274
Most Americans don't want freedom,
they want security.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.678
It's a simple bargain. If...

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.756
Good girl! Good girl!

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.352
If you want to play
with all the new toys

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.398
and be safe, you pay
the price of admission.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.639
Yeah, except people,

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.536
they don't even know
they've made that bargain.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.790
Where's the modern
battlefield, soldier?

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.640
Everywhere.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.349
What's
the first rule of battle?

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.112
Never reveal
your position.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.870
And if one unauthorized person knew?
If Congress knew?

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.712
So would the enemy.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.839
That, Mr. Snowden,
is the state of the world.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.589
Secrecy is security,
and security is victory.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.878
Thank you, sir.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.708
Someone I want you
to meet.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.816
Beautiful day for it, wasn't it?
Perfect weather.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.308
Mr. Lowell. Jim.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.756
How are you?
Dorian.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.193
Alan.
Nice to see you.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.395
Welcome to the U.S.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.038
How'd you make
out today, Corbin?

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.958
Uh, very mediocre.
Nothing like Ed here.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.393
Apparently the Army's training
people to shoot straight.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.277
So this is Ed Snowden.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.560
Yes, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.069
The brains behind Epic Shelter.
That's right.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.496
That's brilliant work.
Thank you, sir.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.016
Yeah, I had a few questions
I wanted to ask you.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.873
Uh, Jim. Will you
excuse me, gentlemen?

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.719
Excuse me, Alan.
Nice to meet you.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.991
Yeah, it's proving very useful
to our UAV program.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.277
Yes, I heard. With foreign
site intel transfer.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.952
Transfers happen
on collection now.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.350
They go straight to the Pentagon,
Mossad if they need it.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.193
Actionable immediately.
No one sees it.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.634
It's improved
the response time

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.597
of our drone pilots
by a factor of ten.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.636
Tell me, Ed. You worked signals
intelligence in Japan too, yes?

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.789
Yes, sir.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.632
How'd you like it?

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.235
It was a very empowering job, sir.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:57.512
With this new job in Hawaii,
you'd have even more access.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.718
I asked Corbin to start the conversation.
But the offer is mine.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.352
Take your time.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.616
It's going to
take a few months

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.949
to get this program
on its feet.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.679
If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen, I see dinner.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.597
Beer, sir?
Thank you.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.077
Sir, for you?
Uh, no, thank you.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.796
Epic Shelter was meant
as a backup program.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.516
Lowell is creating
this position for you, Ed.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.194
You'd be the first contractor
outside Fort Meade

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.918
working counter-cyber.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.190
It's your ticket to the top.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.016
Do you believe the United States

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.996
is the greatest country
in the world?

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.718
Yes.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.296
Have you ever used

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.993
any programs
you were unauthorized for?

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.995
No.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.193
We're not usually
supposed to submit our own work,

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.556
but my editor said
she'd make an exception.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.675
Pretty neat, huh?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.150
I get to
submit an entry.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.954
You ignoring me
on purpose, or what?

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.554
No. Sorry.
Shit. Uh...

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.355
I was just thinking.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.674
About what?

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.349
I wanted to talk to you
about it at dinner,

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.670
but let's just...
Will you come sit down?

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.230
Is everything okay?

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.514
Yeah.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.788
Um...

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.519
The, uh, Deputy Director
of the NSA...

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.079
Hmm?

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.390
He offered me
a new position.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.518
And, uh, that was a while back,
and now they need an answer.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.870
Well, is it something
you want to do?

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.077
I'd be good at it.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.508
Can you tell me anything about it?

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.552
You know I can't.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.473
I know. Mission first.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.234
Well, are there social perks?
White House galas, maybe?

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.433
The position
is in Hawaii.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.278
We worked really hard
to get where we're at.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.951
And you're willing to
just rip it all up again?

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.917
Like we finally have
a house that we love,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.831
and a job that I like,
and real friends,

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.920
and we're close to our families.
I... I understand.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.878
And if you want to stay,
then we're staying.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.515
That's it.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.416
Don't just say that
'cause I wanna hear it.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.440
I'm not.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.075
I let you go once,
I'm not gonna do it again.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.791
Shit. I'm sorry.
The pasta.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.520
It's gonna... One sec.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.376
You know, I think I actually
came pretty close

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.436
to getting it
right this time.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.273
I'll get some candles.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.153
Oh, my God! Ed! Ed! Ed!

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.713
I know Tegretol.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.936
I know it slows you down,
'cause I've seen it in my mom.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.679
She's taken all kinds
of medications her whole life.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.714
Well, they work
in 70% of cases.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.431
Ed, epilepsy is
a serious condition.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.432
If you have a seizure
driving yourself,

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.636
or with someone else
in the car,

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.110
or you're in a place
where you could fall,

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.714
this is not something
to be lightly regarded.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.553
It's essential you commit
yourself to this medication.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.314
Okay?

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.349
Yeah.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.113
After you.
Oh, thank you.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.313
I've been thinking about
what the doctor said.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.913
About less stress.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.556
A warmer climate
could help.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.913
If Hawaii is something
that we decide

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.197
would be better
for you, I'll go.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.354
Janine, how'd the White
House conversation go?

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.496
I made it quite clear

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.432
that we were in possession of
an authentic FISA court order.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.988
They wanted to see it.
We refused.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.435
Now I just pray that
it's actually authentic.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.678
Are you actually
questioning that?

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.598
Glenn, no one has ever seen
a FISA court order.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.358
There's no precedent here.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.398
Our source risked his life
for that document. It's real.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.675
T ell us, did the White House
make any specific claims

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.116
about national security that would
prevent you from publishing?

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.999
No. I asked them repeatedly, and
they had no substantive answer.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.456
Then, there you go!
What more do you want?

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.232
You can go out and
know that you're safe.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.313
Glenn, I'd like to talk to
Alan before we go any further.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.435
When does he land?

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.776
In six hours.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.792
No. Absolutely not!
We're sitting ducks here, Janine.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.639
It's 1:00 p.m.
in New York.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.456
If you don't get this out
in the next four hours,

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.296
you'll miss the evening news
on the East Coast.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.788
But we can post
later tonight.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.320
I'm sorry, Glenn.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.641
But Alan's our editor-in-chief,
and I really think that...

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.478
Bullshit! The government knows
that we have these documents now.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.910
The CIA could barge through this door
any minute, and you want more time!

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.838
Act like a fucking journalist
and stop stringing us along!

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.071
I just stood my ground
with the goddamn White House!

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.434
I've risked my career!

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.480
How dare you question
my commitment to this story!

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.936
Okay, let's just
keep our voices down...

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.176
No, you're right.
I am questioning it.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.509
This is absolutely
inappropriate.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.356
We are publishing ourselves.
You're out.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.109
All right, Glenn.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.509
We'll have it ready
by 4:00 p.m.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.033
I have to go over the
story once more. Why?

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.919
Because it still
needs editing, damn you.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.912
All this fucking intelligence
jargon is hurting our brains.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.675
This PRISM story is
still incomprehensible.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.239
PRISM is the second story,
Janine.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.157
Verizon is the first story.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.794
Have it ready to post by 4:00 p. m.,
5:00 at the latest.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.108
Ugh...

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.475
No games, or we're gone.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.313
So, my new job
was counter-spying

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:44.235
on the Chinese at the NSA Regional
Cryptological Center on Oahu.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.595
Hi. You mind placing your
bag down there, sir?

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:53.432
No personal laptops,
no USB sticks, no cell phones,

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.953
no electronic devices
of any kind?

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.109
No, sir.

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:05.915
Thank you.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.235
Thank you.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.552
Snow White!
Is that you?

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040
Gabriel?

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.475
Dude, what the hell are you doing here?
Wow!

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.595
That's amazing.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.715
Oh, man.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.109
What, do you work here?

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.637
Yeah, yeah. Uh, three years,
two months, and five days.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.871
But who's counting, right?
Yeah.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.236
It's like who knew a secret
underground World War II-era base

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.456
would become munchie heaven
for a thousand geeks, right?

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.040
So there's good pizza?
Good pizza, yeah.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.080
That's important.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.718
Elevator's slow
as shit, though.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800
Jesus.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.160
It's something
else, huh?

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:52.270
Yeah. So, uh, what deck
are you working on?

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.999
You NTOC or ROC?

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.912
Between you and me? NTOC.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.513
Cool. You get to
hack the hackers.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.828
You're coming up
in the world.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.234
Fresh brains for you, Trevor.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.515
Trevor James, Interactive
Ops Division Chief.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.600
Ed Snowden.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.194
I've been briefed.
Next door is NTOC.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.190
Defense. That's where
you'll be working.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.230
Over here we have ROC,
our offense.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.430
Now I move between the two.
We run a tight ship here, Snowden.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.873
Yes, sir.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.188
You'll be working
with Haynes.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.713
Hey. Patrick Haynes.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.176
Hey. Nice to meet you.
Good to have you.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.428
You watch out for him.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.336
That's the smartest guy
in the building right here.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360
Come on.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.016
Bro, how many languages
you speak, again?

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.032
I mean, seven in code,
six spoken, two signs.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.120
That's cool.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.233
Great. Another language
I can't understand.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.673
Uh, I'll check you
later, Ed.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.829
Okay. See you.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.593
Wait for it.

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.230
Any moment.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080
We got 'em.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.760
Lights over
Waziristan, gentlemen.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.109
Way to go.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.919
So what exactly do we
contribute to this?

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.696
The underside of
that Reaper drone

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.472
is fixed with
a big-ass antenna,

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:24.319
snarfing the hardware ID
of anything that broadcasts.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.675
We do the geolocator.

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.936
My friend Tasha
here at the Air Force

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.598
rains hellfire.
There she is now.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.920
Hey, Trev.
You likin' the show?

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.470
You know it. We track 'em,
you whack 'em.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.392
And who
did we just track?

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.752
Not who, what.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:41.991
We're targeting bad guys' cell phones.
Sometimes the SIM card.

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.509
Okay, and how do we
know the bad guy

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.192
is in possession of
the bad cell phone

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:47.429
when we strike?

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.555
Well, we don't...

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.638
Course we do. JSOC and CIA have
their people in the field.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.479
What's the program name?

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.839
Epic Shelter.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.071
It was originally some
backup program for, um...

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.549
Catastrophic site failure.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:04.636
Yeah. How did
you know that?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.035
I built it.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.474
You?
Yeah.

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.376
You know I've actually...
I've been thinking about, uh,

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.550
another use
for Epic Shelter.

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.675
What'd you have
in mind?

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.596
Well, I was chatting
with Jim Lowell

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.736
about how there's
so many programs...

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.795
Deputy Director Lowell?

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.030
Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.355
And we were saying there's
so many programs nowadays,

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.536
it's kind of impossible to keep
track of them anymore, right?

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.233
So why not create
a centralized database.

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.073
Ah. Like an index.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.469
Yeah, exactly. Something
that updates in real time,

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.269
you know, we've already got Epic
Shelter collecting our finished intel.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.830
We just need a web portal to
catalogue it, make it searchable.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.359
Let me think about it.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.431
In any case, I'd have to
run it past Fort Meade.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.555
Of course.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.789
Did you have a name?

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.995
Yeah, if it's not taken,
I'd call it Heartbeat.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.199
- Heartbeat.
- Six, five, four,

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.676
three, two, one...

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.079
Engage target.

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.593
You okay down there?

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.835
Yep.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.353
See, this is why I keep saying
we need to hike more.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:25.475
You're right.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.029
Hey, can you look at me?

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.120
Oh!

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.348
Come on. It's been years.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.358
By social media standards,
you don't even exist anymore.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.029
Just one.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.121
Okay, smile. Show me your teeth!

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.479
My elusive E,
finally captured.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.437
So now I'm
a viable boyfriend?

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.714
Yes.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.039
Such a shame, you used to be
such a cute little model.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.155
Little?
Yeah.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.356
Was I little?
Wait!

01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.913
Stop!

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.796
Oh, my God.
What?

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.831
Think you got some sun!

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.990
I'm serious,
it looks good!

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.433
Well, that's impossible.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.195
Hey, um, I've been meaning
to ask you, by the way.

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.599
Did you switch
pharmacies?

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:20.036
'Cause I tried to pick up
your prescription,

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.431
and I couldn't.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.748
Why did you do that?

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.710
Uh, because I was there and
thought it would be helpful.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.991
I stopped taking
the Tegretol.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.439
What? When?

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.192
A couple months ago.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.416
And you're just
now telling me?

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.192
I wanted to tell you.

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:57.556
I did, I just... I can't take
that stuff, it makes me groggy,

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.108
and I need to be
sharp for work.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.838
I need to be on the
ball all the time.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.096
What is it about
this fucking job

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.588
that makes it more
important than your life?

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.314
I don't understand.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.719
Our government...

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:13.799
Our government, what?

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.110
Our government is hemorrhaging
billions of dollars

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.714
every year
to Chinese hackers.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.314
And I've been hired
to shut them down.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.788
A lot of people
are depending on me.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.831
More so than
anyone else?

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480
Yes.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.155
No, this is bullshit.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.718
We didn't come to Hawaii
for you to heal, did we?

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.195
There was never gonna be
a less stressful job out here.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.113
Look, I feel like
I'm made to do this.

01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.149
And if I don't do it, then I don't
know anybody else that can.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.515
It's like I'm on a trajectory
that I can't turn back from.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.159
You can
always turn back.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.936
What I wanted to see

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.396
is if you could give me a yes
or no answer to the question,

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:25.871
"Does the NSA collect
any type of data at all

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.396
"on millions or hundreds
of millions of Americans?"

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.549
No, sir.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:33.633
It does not?

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.799
Not wittingly.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.474
There are cases where
they could inadvertently,

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.437
perhaps, uh, collect,

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.112
but not wittingly.

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.394
Oh, really?

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.496
Thank you, and
I'll have additional questions

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.397
to give you in writing
on that point.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.073
Okay, so, uh,

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.390
what I wanted to
show you guys is, um,

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.995
the slide I ran across while
building this indexing program.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.435
And what is this?

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.318
Okay. So, this is
data collection

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.311
for the month of March

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.670
worldwide,
emails and Skype calls.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:11.074
So France, 70 million.
Germany, 500 million. Brazil, two billion.

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.836
Inside the U.S.,

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.151
3.1 billion emails and calls.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.595
That's not including any of
the telecom company data.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.640
Okay, so what's
the collection in Russia?

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.635
Russia
is 1.5 billion.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.358
Wait, so we're collecting
twice as much

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.032
in the U.S.
as we are in Russia?

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.256
Yeah, I figured it
was a lot, but...

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.510
This shit
is out of hand, man.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.670
Wait. Have you shown
this to anyone else?

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.518
No, you guys
are the first.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.835
Yeah, yeah, you know,
I'd be careful about that.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.936
You know, it could seem
like you're rocking the boat.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.016
Yeah, you're right.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.235
No, I just, uh,
I needed to know

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.629
if I was the only one that
thought this was crazy.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.713
What the fuck's
going on?

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.835
Hey, Trev.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.960
What are you doing
in here?

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.336
It's nothing.
I was just showing them

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.794
this one slide,
I needed some input.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.995
Why the heat map?

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.718
It's my bad, Trev.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.791
I made a bet with Ed
about which country

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.474
we were collecting
the most signals from.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.471
He said Iran,
I said Pakistan.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.993
Who won?

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.755
Ed.

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.630
Yeah, I need to
head out. I'll see you guys.

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.976
You're going
down next time, man.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.115
Yeah, okay.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:18.918
No more bets.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And I don't want anyone
unauthorized in here again.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.513
Especially not
with Heartbeat.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.318
You're right.
Won't happen again.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.353
Happy birthday!

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.560
...in Vegas,
looking at Afghanistan.

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.756
So we're running late hours.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.633
So this blurry object comes
wandering into the strike zone.

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.237
We all knew
that it was a kid.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.520
Poof.

01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:58.920
He's gone.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.280
We called in for clarification,
and the report came back

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.078
that it was a dog.

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.233
Okay. Fine.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.998
Shift's long, day and night.
I don't remember.

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:13.992
But same village,
two, three days later.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.354
We see the funeral party.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.635
We knew it was a kid
that they were burying.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.915
Moms and dads wailing.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.719
And then the order comes down.
Pretty clear. Hit 'em.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.400
Poof.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.478
And they are gone
in a cloud of dust.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.160
I mean, all of them.
The whole fuckin' family.

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.791
But the crazy thing is,

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.711
you come home after work,

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:44.918
kiss your wife, your kids,
back to work the next day.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.160
Pretty soon, you know,
it just all becomes routine.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.513
Fuck that.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.388
You make it sound criminal, man.
It's war. It's a job.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:02.109
Oh, I don't know, man. You
saying jobs can't be criminal?

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:04.320
Not if you're working
for the government.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.753
You ever hear about
the Nuremberg trials, Trev?

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.358
They weren't that long ago.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:13.512
Yeah. And we hung
the Nazi big shots, right?

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:16.515
Yeah, well, the big shots
were the first trial,

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.513
but then the next trial
were just the judges,

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.592
and lawyers,
and policemen, and guards,

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:28.276
and ordinary people just doing
their jobs, following orders.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.596
That's where we got
the Nuremberg principles,

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.798
which then the UN made
into international law,

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:40.351
just in case ordinary jobs
become criminal again.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.914
Just sayin'.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.136
That's gotta
wake you up. You okay?

01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.593
See, I told you
not to grab my hand.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.873
...fucking touch me
anymore.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.670
- Dude! Dude, are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.193
Ed, are you okay?

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.077
Are you okay, man?
I think he's having a...

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.872
Get away,
don't touch him.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.160
- Don't touch him, don't touch him.
- Don't...

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.553
Hey, Ed. How are you?
How's your health?

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:15.116
Hey, Corbin. Uh...

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.954
It's fine.
Thanks for asking.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.919
Must be nerve-wracking
living with that condition.

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.231
You wouldn't know it
to look at your numbers.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.392
Two hundred Chinese IPs down
in your first four months.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.553
Those are, uh,
internal numbers.

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.235
Your colleague, Trevor,
comes out of the CIA like you.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:43.114
He's been, uh, keeping me
informed on your progress.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.751
It's outstanding work.
Heartbeat as well.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:52.552
Thank you. Thanks.
That means a lot.

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.757
Lowell is very pleased.
He, uh, sends his regards.

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.628
That's great to hear.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.954
He, um...

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.718
He doesn't know about
your heat map conversations,

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.951
or some of the ideas you've
expressed to your colleagues.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.119
And he's not going to.

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.633
Yeah. Uh...

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:19.473
You know, Heartbeat
is proving a tricky project.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.516
Collating from
multiple agencies,

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.068
and knowing
where to pull from.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.357
It has helped to talk
it over with colleagues.

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.233
I believe in you, Ed.

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:35.156
Which is why nothing happened to
you after the derog in Geneva.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.799
And I'm very grateful
you've looked out for me.

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:39.989
Or after you, uh,

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.078
omitted the truth
in your last polygraph.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:50.040
What was it you were
withholding exactly?

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.915
Hmm?

01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.439
You remember
that day in class,

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.273
you were talking to us
about the FISA Court?

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.355
You said that they approved
Bush's wiretapping programs.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.191
Sometimes we're restricted
from telling the whole truth.

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.270
Doesn't give us
permission to lie.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.431
Come on, Corbin,

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:20.557
the Director of National
Intelligence just lied to Congress!

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.195
Sorry.

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:31.713
Look at me.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.273
Did you access
an unauthorized program

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.874
that I did not know about?

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.199
Yes.

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.999
It was, uh...

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.797
It was at Geneva.
It was Lindsay.

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.154
I was jealous.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.240
And I'm sorry.
I never did it again.

01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:17.240
Listen, Ed.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.675
I know it's been up and down with
you and Lindsay since Geneva.

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:29.672
It's tough to keep any relationship going.
Few of us do.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:35.151
So, if it'll give you any peace
of mind, I can assure you,

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.870
she's not sleeping with that
photographer friend of hers.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.077
If that's what
you're thinking.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.678
I have to go to
a Five Eyes conference

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.478
in Sydney in
a couple of weeks.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.790
I'll stop off in Hawaii
on the way back.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.754
Okay?

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:59.193
Okay. Thank you.

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:02.959
I'll see you soon.

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:20.394
Hey, Dad.

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.073
Good. Did you get the e-mail
that I sent you with the photos?

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:27.760
Uh-huh.

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.320
Well, I was hoping that
you could send me some...

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:41.995
What are you doing?

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.240
Sit down.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.352
Your e-mail is
being monitored.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.195
So?

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.955
No, it's different now.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.508
It's not passive collection,
it's full-take surveillance.

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.474
It's all of your e-mails, calls,
texts, social media, everything.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.997
It's also possible
that the house is bugged.

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.428
I'm not sure.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.235
By who?

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.398
By a senior officer
at the CIA.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.994
You in trouble?
Is it the Chinese thing?

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.429
Look, there's things
that I wish I could tell you,

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:50.399
but I can't because
you could get very hurt.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.798
What's keeping you safe is
that you don't know anything.

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.950
I'm sorry, I really am.
I didn't want any of this for you.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.436
But I know you would think
I was doing the right thing.

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.311
So just listen to me
for a sec, okay?

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:21.472
When we go back in the house,
everything has to appear normal.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.676
We're gonna act like
nothing has changed,

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.194
but if you do notice
something that's weird,

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.111
you need to
tell me right away.

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:31.596
And you're gonna use an encrypted
e-mail that I'm setting up for you.

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.035
Oh, my God,
I don't think I can do this.

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.678
Yes, you can.
I know you can.

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.158
Do I even have a choice?

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.872
I'm asking you
to trust me.

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.720
And, Linds,
I think it'd be best

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.354
if you went back
to Maryland for a while.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.749
Tell your parents that I'm
away on a business trip

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:01.274
and that you're homesick.

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.072
Are you going away?

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.708
Yes. But just
for a little while.

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.229
No.

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.480
No, I can't go.

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.993
Please.
Just until I get back.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.195
I can't go.

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:25.951
You just said that we have to
appear like nothing's changed.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:29.630
If both of us left at the same time,
wouldn't that seem suspicious?

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:41.639
I will do this for you.

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.631
But it is the last time.

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.154
Yo! Yo, you hear
about Trevor, bro?

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.309
No, what?

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.789
You remember that op
to own the Internet in Syria?

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.074
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.628
Trevor and his TAO team
crashed the core router.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.799
Bro, the whole
country's gone dark.

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.638
Jesus Christ.

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:39.755
Figure it out!

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:40.915
Poor bastards.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.077
Okay, I'm gonna, uh...
I gotta get to work.

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.195
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.912
So, Ed, how's, uh...

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.159
How's Heartbeat coming?

01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:53.029
It's close.

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.909
It's very close.

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.759
Pull it up
on this monitor.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.016
I'm still
trying to access...

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.496
Don't tell me you're
involved in this, too?

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.308
Well, Trevor fucking roped me into going
through their zero-day exploit codes.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.630
This thing is
a fucking mess, man.

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.436
Why did I agree to this?
Good luck.

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.869
This is Patrick...

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.352
What you're gonna
do is you're gonna...

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:24.552
I told him, I...
Help them.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.480
Okay.
Get back to work, guys.

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.520
No, Patrick, show me.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.976
Talk about
getting hung out to dry.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.718
Yeah. Are we set?

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.759
Trouble with the Navy?

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:47.576
One of those idiots ripped
some bullshit piece of Israeli code

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.976
and jammed it down our payload.
Can you fucking believe that?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.069
Script kiddies.

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.616
I know, I know.
I should have listened to you.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.993
God damn it.
Is this it?

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.354
Here.
Yeah, this is it.

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:58.080
I'm gonna make the goddamn
Israelis take the fall for this.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.949
Come on.

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:04.917
Got it? I'm not taking
the fall for this.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.669
Patrick.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.792
Still working on it,
Trev. Hold on.

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:22.240
Nothing. Still nothing.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.720
Yeah, but...

01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:20.716
You, uh... You headed
home already?

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.076
Yeah. I'm not
feeling so well.

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.151
Might not be in
tomorrow either.

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.439
You know,
Trevor's kind of busy,

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:29.953
maybe you could
let him know for me?

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:32.110
Yeah. Yeah, man.
It'd be my pleasure.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.239
You know,
if you're, uh...

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.760
If you're really not feeling well,
dude, maybe you should, uh,

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.078
go back to the States
and see your doctor.

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.311
I think that, you know,
folks would understand that.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:47.832
That sounds like
a smart thing.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.399
Take care of yourself.

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.314
Yeah, you too, bro.

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.475
Hey.
Hey.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.432
You ever play
with one of these?

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.154
Yeah, when I was a kid.

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:28.595
Yeah. You should try it.
It's hard.

01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:51.439
I can't figure this out.

01:48:57.840 --> 01:48:59.478
I don't know
about this.

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.696
Yeah, you gotta start with
the white cross, actually,

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.199
and then you do the corners. Ah.

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:04.760
Oh, man.

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:07.877
Look, I love these things.

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.279
Hey, have
a good weekend, man.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:10.839
You too, buddy.
All right.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:07.794
It's live.

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.956
There's a link to
the FISA court order.

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.829
Well done, Janine.

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:26.433
I told you
she wasn't a pushover.

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.715
Well, it feels so
goddamn good to be wrong.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.696
Breaking news tonight. Reports
that through a secret court order,

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.280
the Obama administration is
collecting the phone records

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.032
of millions of
Verizon customers.

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:46.376
That's been reported by the
Guardian newspaper in the U. K.

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:47.674
The specific court order shows

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:50.877
that all the information is going
to the National Security Agency.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.036
How's that for
mainstream media, Glenn?

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.793
They can't shut this down now.
And we've got four more days of it.

01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.990
They have no idea what
they're in store for.

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.160
That's fantastic!

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.096
...former Speaker of the House is
on the grill tonight and joins me now.

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.475
Another explosive
article has just appeared,

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:07.993
this time in
The Washington Post.

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:10.150
It's breaking news
that it reveals

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:13.630
another broad and secret U. S.
government surveillance program.

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:17.315
The Washington Post and the
Guardian in London reporting

01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:18.919
that the NSA and the FBI

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.117
are tapping directly
into the central servers

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.509
of nine leading
Internet companies,

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:27.194
including Microsoft,
Yahoo, Google, Facebook,

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:30.192
AOL, Skype, YouTube,
and Apple.

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.510
The Post says
they're extracting audio,

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:35.433
video, photographs,
e-mails, documents,

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:36.714
and connection logs

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:39.109
that enable analysts to
track a person's movements

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.430
and contacts over time.

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:48.315
In the abstract, you can
complain about Big Brother

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.518
and how this is a potential
program run amok.

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.790
But when you actually
look at the details,

01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.950
then I think we've struck
the right balance.

01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:00.191
U.S. President
Barack Obama staunchly defends

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.475
U.S. government programs,

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:05.916
insisting that they were
conducted with broad safeguards

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.275
and to protect against abuse.

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:12.400
He reached the conclusion
that what was happening

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.869
inside this really
secretive agency

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:17.235
uh, was very
threatening and menacing

01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:19.709
to privacy rights,
to Internet freedom,

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.598
to basic political liberty,
not only in the United States,

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.716
but all around the world.

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:28.515
And he felt it was his duty as
a human being to disclose it.

01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:42.551
Uh, my name's Ed Snowden.
I'm 29 years old.

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:44.073
I work for
Booz Allen Hamilton

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.675
as an infrastructure analyst
for NSA in Hawaii.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.470
The identity of the man
who sent the Obama...

01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:04.758
You can't come forward against the
most powerful intelligence agencies

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:07.440
in the world without expecting
to have some risk.

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:09.590
They're just such
powerful adversaries.

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:12.598
So no one can
meaningfully oppose them.

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:13.789
He did it.

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.713
You know, if they want to get you,
they will get you, in time.

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:17.800
The kid did it!

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:19.816
And it's just gonna get
worse for the next generation,

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.193
as they extend
the capabilities

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:24.795
of this sort of
architecture of oppression.

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.192
And you realize that you might
be willing to accept any risk,

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:33.029
as long as the public is able
to make their own decision

01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:34.752
about how
this is applied.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.719
Because even if you haven
't done anything wrong,

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:39.756
you're being
watched and recorded.

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:44.231
Look, I had access to the
entire intelligence community.

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:47.551
So, if I had wanted
to harm the U. S.,

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:51.872
you could shut down the entire
surveillance system in an afternoon.

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:55.236
But that was never
my intention.

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:58.392
And I think anybody
that's making that argument,

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:02.837
they have to think,
if they were in my position,

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:06.674
living in Hawaii, in paradise,
and making a ton of money,

01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:11.629
what would it take to make
you leave everything behind?

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:17.356
The fear that I think I have
most in regards to the outcome

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:20.193
for America of
these disclosures

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:22.475
is that nothing
will change.

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.348
In the coming months and the coming
years, it'll just get worse.

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:29.000
And then eventually,
at some point,

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:33.153
some new leader
will be elected

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:37.119
who flips the switch,

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:44.038
and the people won't be able to do
anything, by that point, to oppose it.

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:47.070
And it'll be
turnkey tyranny.

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.200
How you holding up?

01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.270
Yeah, I'll be fine.

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:55.696
It's you guys that have
to start watching out

01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:57.199
for yourselves now.

01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.874
You know, if you have
any reason to believe

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.556
that you're about to be raided or
intercepted or breached in any way,

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:10.191
you format and destroy
all the data immediately.

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:13.238
You have
the encrypted backups.

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.439
And now, I...

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.352
I no longer have any access
to these files myself.

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:23.078
You guys have them all.

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.189
Uh...

01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:29.478
Keep the focus on the stories,
that's all that matters.

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:33.158
If you'll excuse me, it's...

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:38.070
I think we should all get some rest.
We can use it.

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:41.432
Yeah. I should probably
lay down on a soft bed

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.556
while I still have
one available, right?

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:47.077
You rest well.
Thank you.

01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:50.713
See you tomorrow.
Good night.

01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.355
Can you at least tell me
where you're going?

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.798
Listen,
I know that I'm...

01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:09.752
Ewen, I'm on
the second floor.

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.599
I don't see Tibbo.

01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:17.235
No. No, no, wait.
Okay. I think I see him.

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.235
Shit!

01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:22.269
There's press swarming
all over the hotel.

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:24.032
Yeah, I don't know.
I'll figure it out.

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.160
I'll stop them with a press
conference or something.

01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:30.193
Hey, I'm Glenn.
Look, we really appreciate this.

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:32.416
We understand you're one of the
best lawyers in Hong Kong.

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.475
We'll do our best.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:36.518
We're gonna take him to the UN first,
then I prefer not to reveal.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.600
I understand.

01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:39.915
Shit. They spotted me.
You guys get going.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.296
Okay, I will take your questions
in an orderly fashion.

01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:46.456
Where is Snowden?
Do you know where he is?

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.136
Come on,
please let us know!

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.229
Did you get them?

01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:50.912
Yeah, this is the best
I could do.

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:53.600
You're meeting Tibbo
in five minutes,

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:56.194
on the skybridge
opposite the large mall.

01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:04.192
I've met a lot of astonishing
people in my life, but you...

01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.675
Okay, laddie.
Off you go.

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:11.119
I won't let you down.

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:15.794
You'd make a shitty journalist
without a camera.

01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:18.432
Are you sure?
Yeah.

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.792
Okay. That's a great idea.

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:24.680
Thanks.

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.156
Oh! You don't want to
leave your luck behind.

01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:30.720
Oh.

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.837
I think I'd like you
to have that.

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.270
Thanks for everything.

01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:39.029
Thank you.

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:04.200
I have
a van on the street.

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:12.391
NSA leaker Edward
Snowden has now been charged formally

01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:17.235
with espionage, theft, and
conversion of government property.

01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:19.176
U. S. officials have asked Hong Kong

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.713
to detain
the former contractor

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:22.637
on a provisional
arrest warrant.

01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:24.836
Snowden has been
in Hong Kong since May...

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:28.117
...remember, that
was back reportedly on May 20th.

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.376
...Snowden has checked
out of the luxury hotel in Hong Kong,

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:32.628
where he had been holed up.

01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:36.896
You might
turn your eyes away.

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:38.416
...not likely
take action against him

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.496
without an arrest
warrant from the U. S.

01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.216
The Justice Department
had to go to Interpol so that Snowden,

01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:44.496
if he tried to cross a border,
he could be intercepted and detained.

01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:45.976
Snowden is still in hiding.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000
So again...

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.816
But the
Americans are now closing in.

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.990
They almost certainly know
where he is,

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:53.714
they just need Hong Kong's
approval to get him.

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:55.576
The Hong
Kong government does have

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:57.636
an extradition agreement
with Washington.

01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:58.840
But the ultimate decision...

01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:02.350
So the big
question here is, where is he now?

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:08.157
Thank you.
This is Ed. Ed, Mayana.

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:09.912
Hi, Ed. Welcome.
Thank you.

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.878
Thank you.

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.711
These are good people.
They won't talk.

02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:18.158
I've been handling their cases for years.
They're like you.

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:19.434
That's so nice.

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:21.637
They're stateless.
Yeah.

02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:25.556
So we're waiting on the UN
application for refugee status.

02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:26.755
Yeah.

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:29.673
Just in case you're arrested,
this is where you can call me.

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:30.795
Yeah.

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.109
Good.

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.119
Thank you so much.

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.996
You may not feel it,
Ed, but you're not alone.

02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:46.949
Thank you.

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:51.696
...his longtime
girlfriend, Lindsay Mills,

02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:52.914
an amateur photographer,

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.399
has not been heard from.

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.391
It's believed
she's in seclusion

02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:57.993
in her parents' home
in Maryland,

02:00:58.080 --> 02:00:59.911
and has been questioned
by the FBI

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.911
and remains
under investigation.

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:07.594
Ten days have now gone by,
as the world looks for Edward Snowden.

02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:11.070
Rumors have surfaced that a rich
supporter is hiding Snowden

02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:14.510
somewhere in the Hong Kong
hills in a private mansion.

02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:48.915
It is now
confirmed that Edward Snowden

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.309
has boarded a flight
from Hong Kong to Moscow.

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.336
The State
Department is very disappointed

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:54.952
in the authorities
in Hong Kong

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:56.678
for letting Snowden go.

02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:59.376
He was accompanied
by a representative from WikiLeaks.

02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.551
Snowden is trying
to make his way from Russia to Cuba,

02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:04.835
and then to Ecuador
for political asylum.

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:07.216
Moscow airport
officials say he won't be permitted

02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:08.639
to make his connective flight

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:11.154
because the U. S. government
has revoked his passport.

02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.959
The United States
Secretary of State, John Kerry,

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:17.919
outraged that Russia is refusing
to arrest the American fugitive.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.152
Now a man without a country
stranded inside the Moscow airport.

02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:24.913
No, I'm not gonna
be scrambling jets, uh,

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.596
to get a 29-year-old hacker.

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:32.696
The
President of Bolivia's plane

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.995
was forced down in
Austria airspace today

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:39.358
following U. S. suspicions that
Snowden may have been on board.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.795
After
39 days in the airport hotel,

02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:44.314
he's left with his Russian
lawyer and a legal advisor

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:46.516
from WikiLeaks,
Sarah Harrison.

02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.198
He can now enjoy
all of the sweet, sweet liberty

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:53.431
allowed under the regime
of President Vladimir Putin.

02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:56.717
There is still
a thing called execution.

02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:58.176
Mr. Snowden
actually deserves asylum

02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.474
and protection
around the globe.

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.717
But he does have asylum
in Russia at least.

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:04.791
He can engage in
the debate he started.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:06.714
And the world
now has an example

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:08.040
that you can do
the right thing,

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:11.874
and you don't have to end up
in a cage, one room, a prison.

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:17.157
After more than a year
in the country under temporary asylum,

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.631
Edward Snowden has received a
three-year residency permit in Russia.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.037
And now,
here live from Moscow,

02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:34.912
Edward Snowden.

02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:38.157
Hi, Ed. How you doing?

02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:44.993
Thank you.

02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:47.995
Uh, forgive me if I get my
bearings a little bit here.

02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.548
People always said
I was kind of a robot.

02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:54.554
How is it that
you came to be in Russia?

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.912
Well, I never intended
to come here.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.913
You know, my passport was revoked
en route to Latin America.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.639
So when people say,
"Why are you in Russia?"

02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:06.598
I say,
"Ask the State Department."

02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.035
Does that mean you're willing
to go back and face trial?

02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:15.633
Absolutely, if it was
a fair and public trial.

02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:19.033
Unfortunately, that's not
what would happen right now,

02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:23.193
as long as the Espionage Act is
being used against whistleblowers.

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:26.516
Do you still
think it was worth it?

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:27.635
Yes, I do.

02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:31.633
Without the information
to start a public debate,

02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:33.119
we're lost.
You know...

02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:37.269
The people being able
to question our government

02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:39.954
and hold it accountable,

02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:44.955
that's the principle that the United
States of America was founded on.

02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.789
So if we want to protect
our national security,

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:51.314
we should be protecting
that principle.

02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:55.235
What if your
argument falls on deaf ears?

02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:57.629
What if our leaders
don't act?

02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:01.671
I believe that,
if nothing changes,

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:07.231
more and more people all over
the world will come forward.

02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:12.914
Whistleblowers and journalists,
but also regular citizens.

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:19.596
And when those in power try to
hide by classifying everything,

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:23.193
we will call them out on it.

02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:29.477
And when they try to scare us into
sacrificing our basic human rights,

02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:31.835
we won't be intimidated,

02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:36.590
and we won't give up,
and we will not be silenced.

02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:40.071
You're alone in
a foreign country,

02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:43.391
you'll be extradited
if you try to leave.

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:45.152
That must be hard.

02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:01.229
When I left Hawaii,
I lost everything.

02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:06.836
And I had a stable life.

02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:11.996
A stable love.

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:13.991
Family. Future.

02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:17.631
And I lost that life,

02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:22.636
but I've gained
a new one,

02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.951
and I'm incredibly
fortunate.

02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:30.719
And I think

02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:34.160
the greatest freedom
that I've gained

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:37.835
is the fact that I no longer have to
worry about what happens tomorrow,

02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:40.309
because I'm happy with
what I've done today.

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:48.753
Live from the Internet,
Edward Snowden!

02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:08.456
Has your
mindset changed about him?

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:12.553
Is he now more whistleblower
than he is a, uh, hacker?

02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:51.976
What is going
to happen to Edward Snowden?

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.719
He's going to die in Moscow.
He's not coming home.

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:34.995
Edward Snowden,
is he a traitor or a hero?

02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:38.351
He stole
very important information.

02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.336
We have
breaking news tonight...

02:09:58.360 --> 02:09:59.360
Among the reforms,

02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:02.113
work with Congress to change how
the NSA collects phone records.

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:05.754
Mandate more transparency
by the secret court

02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.910
that regularly approves
the surveillance.

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:11.796
Well, is it
a victory for Edward Snowden?

02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:13.720
That's gonna depend
on the eye of the beholder.

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:17.936
The American
government was acting illegally.

02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:21.200
I don't think he should
be brought home without facing the music.

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:24.757
Snowden played
a very important role

02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:26.990
in educating
the American people

02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:31.471
to the degree in which our civil
liberties and our constitutional rights

02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:32.709
are being undermined.
