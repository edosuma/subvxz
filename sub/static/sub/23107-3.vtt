WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:06.906
[explosion]

00:08.341 --> 00:09.175
[gunshots]

00:16.683 --> 00:21.321
He's a man known for no other life
than a life of crime, violence, death,

00:21.388 --> 00:22.589
and destruction.

00:26.893 --> 00:29.396
[cartel member]
Son of your whore mother fucking traitor

00:29.462 --> 00:31.765
We're gonna get you wherever you go.

00:36.669 --> 00:40.907
[Trump]  We will build a great wall
along the southern border.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.362
[on radio] Go ahead, Charlie 1.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.021
[Ezequiel]
I wanna open this one and take a look.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.329
The quality of the merchandise...

02:10.530 --> 02:14.801
is judged firstly by the size of the buds,

02:15.034 --> 02:18.505
but also whether it has seeds.

02:19.372 --> 02:22.442
If I crumble this bud here,

02:23.243 --> 02:26.546
you can see it's full of seeds.

02:26.679 --> 02:30.950
That's no good because the buyers
want it nice and green

02:31.584 --> 02:33.586
without the seeds.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.823
This stuff here is really good.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.727
I'll take this one, bro.
Everything you have like this.

02:41.928 --> 02:44.364
[narrator]
This weed farm is one of hundreds

02:44.430 --> 02:46.833
dotted throughout
the Sierra Madre Mountains

02:46.900 --> 02:48.334
in Sinaloa province.

02:49.402 --> 02:52.071
Part of an area known
as The Golden Triangle.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.508
Notorious for marijuana grows,

02:56.342 --> 02:57.744
meth labs,

02:59.112 --> 03:00.680
and heroin farms.

03:05.051 --> 03:08.721
Control of this area
has enabled the Sinaloa cartel

03:08.788 --> 03:12.192
to become the most powerful
drug trafficking organization

03:12.725 --> 03:13.826
in the world.

03:33.646 --> 03:34.914
[Ezequeil] Okay, now we're good.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.216
One, two, three.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.051
Slowly, look after the merchandise.

03:46.492 --> 03:50.797
[narrator]  The workers use a vice
to compress the weed into 30kg bales...

03:51.764 --> 03:52.899
ready for smuggling.

03:54.601 --> 03:58.338
It's the first step in a supply chain
that stretches across Mexico

03:58.404 --> 04:00.106
to the United States,

04:00.173 --> 04:02.942
earning the cartel billions of dollars.

04:30.403 --> 04:34.307
[Waldo] You there, boss?
Yep, I'm headed for the beach now.

04:50.690 --> 04:55.561
It might seem like the people
around here are normal.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.466
They seem like everyday citizens,

05:01.100 --> 05:07.307
but those seemingly normal people

05:07.373 --> 05:09.108
could be involved in crime

05:10.443 --> 05:12.612
[narrator]
Captain Gonzalez and his battalion are

05:12.679 --> 05:14.514
on patrol patrol in the Sierra.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.316
Their mission...

05:16.382 --> 05:19.319
to locate and destroy cartel operations.

05:22.522 --> 05:26.559
I'm certain at this very moment they know
that we are crossing this avenue.

05:26.859 --> 05:33.833
Organized crime place lookouts
with radios in strategic places.

05:34.834 --> 05:40.406
The lookouts feed this information
to armed groups called Sicarios.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.749
[driver] They wouldn't think twice
about attacking us.

05:49.816 --> 05:53.186
If they come face to face with the army
and feel there's no other way,

05:53.252 --> 05:57.156
they will fight the army
using high caliber weapons.

05:57.223 --> 06:00.960
And you as a soldier have to respond
with the same degree of force.

06:02.161 --> 06:06.099
This has always been a problematic zone,

06:06.232 --> 06:12.105
but right now it's more intense because
of the turf war within the cartel.

06:12.171 --> 06:15.274
They're fighting over this area.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.680
[narrator]  Gonzalez has just received
intel from a local informant.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.783
about suspicious activity
at a nearby farm.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.420
[Gonzalez]
Falcon, Falcon, Charlie 1 speaking.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.289
[Falcon]  Go ahead, Charlie 1.

06:30.690 --> 06:36.129
[Gonzalez]  Proceed with the recon
and secure the area.

06:37.697 --> 06:40.133
[Falcon]
We'll provide cover as you move in.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.843
[Gonzalez]  Bravo 10, Bravo 10.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.745
Do you copy?

06:52.812 --> 06:55.648
[Falcon]  Affirmative, affirmative, got it.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.406
[narrator]  It's not a weed stash,

07:20.706 --> 07:24.010
but a meth lab of industrial proportions.

07:29.982 --> 07:34.086
[Gonzalez] Look the aircon is still on,
it's almost certain they were just here,

07:34.153 --> 07:36.389
and then fled as soon
as they knew we were coming.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.226
[narrator]  The cartel's cooks have escaped.

07:41.327 --> 07:45.598
Here you can see more containers filled
with the different chemical s

07:45.665 --> 07:48.601
that they use
in the drug manufacturing process.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.473
[narrator]  There's three tons of meth here.

07:57.510 --> 08:01.681
[Gonzalez]  The product you can see here
is not yet finished,

08:01.747 --> 08:04.450
it's in the third stage of the process.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.588
[narrator]  Most of it is almost ready
to ship to the US.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.426
it's a disaster for the cartel.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.164
One that puts even more pressure
on the marijuana traffickers

08:18.231 --> 08:20.066
to get their payload into America.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.802
Their first stop...

08:23.169 --> 08:26.339
Culiacan,
the capital of Sinaloa.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.513
[narrator]
A city built on the cartel's drug money.

08:53.065 --> 08:56.035
Here, among the graves
of law-abiding citizens ,

08:56.269 --> 09:00.640
dead narco bosses are laid
to rest in tombs as big as houses.

09:05.411 --> 09:09.448
At a shrine in the city center,
locals pray to the patron saint

09:09.515 --> 09:12.552
of narco traffickers, Jesus Malverde.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.256
The legendary Malverde
was a Robin Hood outlaw

09:17.557 --> 09:20.026
who stole from the rich
and gave to the poor.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.831
Cartel leaders portray themselves
as modern day equivalents,

09:25.898 --> 09:30.202
stealing from rich gringos
to provide for the poor of Sinaloa.

09:39.545 --> 09:40.646
[narrator]  Meanwhile...

09:40.713 --> 09:44.250
the narcos' children
race million dollar sports cars

09:44.850 --> 09:48.721
and post pictures
of gold-plated Uzis and trophy wives.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.007
[narrator]  On the outskirts of Culiacan,

10:08.107 --> 10:11.243
the beach resort of Altata
provides the next link

10:11.310 --> 10:12.878
in the marijuana supply chain.

10:23.422 --> 10:27.326
[El Pescador] I'm down at the jetty.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.295
I'm on my way, see you soon.

10:30.863 --> 10:34.700
[El Pescador] During the day I fish,
during the night I traffic marijuana.

10:35.368 --> 10:39.839
The Sinaloa cartel own the goods

10:39.905 --> 10:43.676
and if I lost them or something...

10:43.743 --> 10:45.211
they would kill me.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.489
[El Pescador]
All my friends, all my neighbors,

10:56.555 --> 10:58.157
almost all are involved in trafficking.

10:59.692 --> 11:05.331
I mostly do trips
with two tons of marijuana.

11:06.699 --> 11:12.505
In the US, two tons is worth $2.5 million.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.079
[narrator]
Shot by the fishermen themselves,

11:20.312 --> 11:24.316
this is the first time this
trafficking route has ever been filmed.

11:27.620 --> 11:31.524
Throughout the journey,
the crew use cocaine to stay alert.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.165
[El Pescador]
The Navy almost caught me once

11:39.632 --> 11:43.169
I didn't stop, I just put my foot down,
and they fired at me.

11:43.803 --> 11:50.609
I was on the brink of being caught
and very nearly killed.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.586
[narrator]  Traveling by boat is slow,

12:00.653 --> 12:02.922
but avoids military checkpoints,

12:03.489 --> 12:08.127
and lowers the risk of being ambushed
by rival factions within the cartel.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.497
The war within the Sinaloa Cartel

12:11.630 --> 12:17.870
is very dangerous for me,
my family and everyone.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.939
They all want to be number one.

12:20.372 --> 12:24.677
I work exclusively for my boss
and that can create problems

12:24.744 --> 12:30.082
because of envy,
there's envy within the cartel.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.121
[narrator]
Taking a winding route along the coast,

12:35.454 --> 12:37.089
the fishermen head north.

12:37.723 --> 12:41.627
It will take them four days
and nights to reach their destination:

12:42.161 --> 12:43.329
Penasco.

12:50.202 --> 12:56.876
[El Pescador]  When we get to shore,
large articulated lorries are waiting.

12:57.009 --> 13:01.747
We get down, unload the goods
and place them onto the trucks.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.417
The lorries can then head to Nogales.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.297
[narrator]
But first they have to get through here.

13:18.864 --> 13:22.301
The Caro-Bobby military checkpoint
in northern Mexico.

13:32.077 --> 13:34.046
Equipped with the latest tech,

13:35.614 --> 13:38.317
and manned
by highly trained military police.

13:56.902 --> 14:01.473
[monitor]  Guard, please send that trailer
to access gate number one.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.579
[narrator]  A truck has just failed
initial inspection.

14:08.113 --> 14:11.684
An X-ray scan has revealed
several suspicious packages.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.394
The movement of drugs here
is on a large scale.

14:23.996 --> 14:29.768
We inspect 1500 vehicles
with trailers every day.

14:30.636 --> 14:35.908
[Lt. Col Salazar]   On average we catch
10 to 12 loads a month .

14:36.375 --> 14:42.381
The largest bust we've had
was three tons of marijuana.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.384
[analyst] See, this over here?

14:47.753 --> 14:51.190
[narrator]  An analyst flags the vehicle
for a detailed search.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.697
Right now we're in the area
where the vehicles are inspected.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.400
[dog growling]

15:09.275 --> 15:11.810
[narrator]  The driver of the truck
looks on nervously.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.815
If there are drugs here,
the dog will find them.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.439
[narrator]  But not today.

15:41.573 --> 15:42.508
It's candy.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.544
[narrator]  This truck is clean.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.749
But with hundreds of big rigs arriving
at the checkpoint every hour,

15:50.816 --> 15:52.985
drugs inevitably slip through.

15:59.224 --> 16:02.828
[narrator]  Once the marijuana shipment
is safely past Caro-Bobby,ƒ

16:02.895 --> 16:06.799
it's a two hour drive to the next,
major link in the supply chain:

16:07.333 --> 16:08.434
Nogales.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.640
Nogales is located right on the border,

16:14.707 --> 16:17.609
just south of two major
US distribution hubs:

16:18.210 --> 16:19.211
Tucson,

16:21.046 --> 16:22.214
and Phoenix.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.819
Making it a key gateway
for sending drugs to the US.

16:37.162 --> 16:41.600
[narrator]  The Sinaloa cartel stranglehold
on the US drug market depends

16:41.800 --> 16:43.302
on controlling this town.

16:53.445 --> 16:54.580
[Ludo] Six zero three.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.117
Okay, we're ready and waiting.

17:08.594 --> 17:13.065
[Ludo] They're uncovering the bunker
where we hide the merchandise

17:17.736 --> 17:19.505
[voices on radio]

17:19.571 --> 17:22.674
[El Comandante] The shipment's about
to arrive at the safehouse.

17:23.275 --> 17:29.581
When they deliver marijuana
or let's say coke, heroin or meth,

17:29.681 --> 17:33.852
we've got to make sure no one steals it.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.555
The whole area has got to be secured.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.831
[narrator]  El Comandante
and his team are trained killers.

17:46.732 --> 17:51.537
I've been doing this since I was 14,
to be honest, because I really like it.

17:57.176 --> 18:00.379
[narrator]  It's their job to protect
the marijuana shipment.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.318
[El Comandante]
We've got lookouts all around

18:06.385 --> 18:09.955
and they tell us over the radio

18:10.022 --> 18:13.425
if the government is coming
or a suspicious car is entering our area.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.130
The greatest threats come from
other people from the same organization,

18:18.230 --> 18:19.465
the Sinaloa cartel.

18:20.432 --> 18:24.970
This other faction is trying to get in,
they want to take our turf.

18:26.071 --> 18:30.042
[narrator]  In recent weeks the risk
of a hijack has increased.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.178
[El Comandante]  We could come up against
a car full of armed men

18:34.012 --> 18:35.080
and who knows what might happen.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.117
Someone could get shot.
They die, we die.

18:39.418 --> 18:41.153
It's a big deal, every day.

18:42.087 --> 18:45.858
Still we've got to get them out,
with bullets or blows, whatever it takes

18:45.924 --> 18:48.360
because this territory is ours.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.501
[gunshots]

18:57.302 --> 18:59.171
[man] That's all, bitches!

19:01.773 --> 19:03.075
[narrator]  Sensing weakness,

19:03.242 --> 19:07.012
rival cartels are moving
in on Sinaloa's operations.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.181
[repetitive gunshots]

19:18.190 --> 19:20.926
[narrator]
The war within the cartel is hotting up.

19:22.461 --> 19:25.264
And that is keeping the sicarios busy.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.824
[narrator]
The marijuana shipment has been delivered.

20:07.806 --> 20:11.810
I'm in charge of the bunker,
receiving the product.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.648
I note down in my book
what comes in and what goes out.

20:18.650 --> 20:22.254
[narrator]  It's up to Ludo, 
the plaza boss, to check the quality.

20:22.354 --> 20:27.659
[Bozo]  This one weighs 10 kilos
so it costs $100 here,

20:27.726 --> 20:31.430
and in the US it's worth about $11,000.

20:32.931 --> 20:36.335
[Bozo]  Right now there are millions
of dollars worth here.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.639
[narrator]
The shipment will be warehoused here

20:40.706 --> 20:42.541
with another five tons of weed.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.377
All waiting to be smuggled
across the border,

20:46.144 --> 20:48.480
so Ludo's bosses can get paid.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.858
[Ludo]  If you're not making money,
you get eaten alive.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.996
So, you have to find a way
to keep working.

21:08.033 --> 21:12.037
[Ludo]
You have to impose respect, to be hard.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.774
In my case, I'm always on the defensive.

21:15.841 --> 21:21.613
Treat me well, I treat you well,
treat me badly, you get what you deserve.

21:41.366 --> 21:43.969
[Ludo]  The money gives us a good life...

21:44.036 --> 21:50.575
a good life for our children.

21:51.943 --> 21:54.313
We try to give them the best.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.950
We send them to the best schools,
so that they do well,

21:59.017 --> 22:03.088
so they don't end up doing what we do.

22:07.626 --> 22:12.197
[Ludo]  For the future,
it's about trying to make a buck ,

22:12.998 --> 22:15.334
so we're able to do something else.

22:15.967 --> 22:20.739
Whether that's buying livestock
or an arable farm,

22:21.373 --> 22:22.974
or setting up a business...

22:23.575 --> 22:27.979
that will make money,
not as much as drug trafficking,

22:28.046 --> 22:29.481
but something similar.

22:29.981 --> 22:32.617
When that day comes, we'll retire.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.093
We've been friends since we were thirteen.

22:41.159 --> 22:46.431
We were at school together.
We were friends and classmates.

22:46.998 --> 22:53.472
We left school in search of a living,

22:54.306 --> 22:55.807
some way to make money.

22:56.942 --> 23:03.115
First we planted it together
and now we export it together.

23:09.087 --> 23:14.526
[Ludo] You put it in a sack like this
to make a package and tie it up.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.132
You put another one in the sack,
twist and tie it up.

23:20.932 --> 23:24.469
Then attach shoulder straps.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.255
Anything you're bringing back
from Mexico today?

23:43.321 --> 23:45.290
No drugs? No weapons?

23:47.225 --> 23:49.227
[narrator]  Unlike meth and heroin,

23:49.294 --> 23:53.165
marijuana is too bulky to traffic
across the border by vehicle.

23:58.236 --> 23:59.104
Instead...

23:59.471 --> 24:04.009
Ludo sends small groups of drug mules,
carrying bales of marijuana.

24:04.476 --> 24:06.912
Via a secret backcountry route.

24:30.068 --> 24:35.273
[Ludo] This is a can of black spray paint.
We use it to paint the water containers

24:35.340 --> 24:39.277
because they are clear
and reflective in sunlight

24:39.344 --> 24:43.048
and Border Patrol look out
for these reflections.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.952
[narrator]
Ludo's drug mules are professionals.

24:47.586 --> 24:52.090
[drug mule] These are carpet shoes.
They are also camouflaged.

24:52.190 --> 24:56.294
We put our trainers on first
and then these over the trainers.

24:56.695 --> 25:01.433
The bottom is lined with carpet,
so that we don't leave any tracks.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.669
[narrator]
Ahead of them, lies a five day journey

25:04.936 --> 25:08.173
through some of the most
inhospitable terrain on the planet.

25:14.779 --> 25:17.949
[narrator]  First they're driven west
to a deserted part of the border

25:18.016 --> 25:19.918
where they can cross undetected.

25:20.585 --> 25:23.021
Then they must pass through the mountains

25:23.688 --> 25:28.793
and finally, there's a 150 mile trek
through the desert to reach the i8...

25:29.628 --> 25:33.865
and a cartel taxi   that will take them
to a safe house in Phoenix.

25:37.068 --> 25:40.038
[drug mule]  It's called cat and mouse,
that's the name of the game.

25:40.939 --> 25:42.240
It's a big risk.

25:44.175 --> 25:46.578
On this side of the border
we're wanted by the Mexican army...

25:50.115 --> 25:52.317
and on the other side,
we're hunted by the US Border Patrol.

25:52.918 --> 25:56.588
But law enforcement is only one
of the dangers of the journey.

25:59.024 --> 26:02.093
Sometimes stick-up crews appear and shoot
at us because they want the cargo.

26:03.762 --> 26:06.865
The cartel owns the cargo we carry.

26:08.066 --> 26:12.470
If we don't get to the destination
with our cargo, Sicarios could kill us.

26:19.044 --> 26:22.180
You can earn the equivalent
of three months wages in five days.

26:23.548 --> 26:25.951
Mules earn $1,500 per trip.

26:27.819 --> 26:30.021
[narrator]
But they don't get paid until the weed

26:30.088 --> 26:32.090
is safely delivered in the US.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.726
[drug mule] We can only afford 
to have one meal a day,

26:35.060 --> 26:37.963
which we eat while walking,
so we only take light stuff.

26:39.631 --> 26:43.168
[drug mule]
We take toast, tuna, biscuits, beans.

26:43.468 --> 26:49.741
We also take lemons to make syrup.
We add salt and sugar and drink it.

26:50.241 --> 26:54.079
We carry the food in this backpack.

26:54.913 --> 27:00.218
We use camouflage because it's better
if we're sitting amongst the branches.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.855
We leave the backpacks against a tree
so they can't be spotted so easily.

27:11.129 --> 27:18.103
Weed helps us relax, helps your legs rest,
it helps you rest the shoulder here

27:19.070 --> 27:22.073
because with the backpack and weed packets

27:22.140 --> 27:26.378
you get really tired. Your muscles swell.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.013
And that's why I smoke weed.

27:45.397 --> 27:48.233
[narrator]  The mules' first obstacle
is the border wall .

28:04.115 --> 28:08.086
Over half a million people attempt
to cross illegally each year.

28:13.992 --> 28:16.728
Around 200,000 of them succeed.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.367
I saw two bodies came over.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.403
One is TBSd,
the other one's in the bushes.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.372
And one went back to Mexico.

28:28.773 --> 28:30.775
Okay, there's the...
So, it's going to be up here.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.581
Get off there. We'll just get--
Just go up there. Go up there.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.185
[narrator]
US border patrol agents Stukenberg

28:40.251 --> 28:42.687
and Hernandez are responding to a call.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.758
Three people have been spotted
jumping the wall.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.432
[on radio]  Units are reinforcing.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.734
You're clear.

28:57.535 --> 28:59.537
[Stukenberg]
Is this body still north of the road?

29:01.906 --> 29:03.208
In here somewhere?

29:03.742 --> 29:04.943
In here somewhere?

29:06.211 --> 29:07.045
Alright.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.014
Right here, right here, right here!

29:10.081 --> 29:11.149
Hands in the-- Show me your hands!

29:16.054 --> 29:18.056
[voice on radio]

29:19.591 --> 29:20.759
[Stukenburg] Let's move.

29:21.860 --> 29:24.195
Any weapons?
You have anything on you?

29:24.629 --> 29:25.764
Where are you from?

29:26.264 --> 29:27.365
[immigrant] From Mexico.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.367
From Mexico? Immigration documents?

29:30.602 --> 29:32.303
Do you have a passport and visa with you?

29:33.037 --> 29:35.039
-No.
-No? Only ID?

29:35.273 --> 29:37.308
[narrator]
She could be an illegal immigrant.

29:39.744 --> 29:44.616
The human traffickers who got her across,
have already jumped back over the fence.

29:44.949 --> 29:45.850
[Stukenburg] Over there.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.721
[Stukenburg]  Once they touch that fence
on the south side they're already

29:49.788 --> 29:51.022
on United States property.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.524
They're on federal property.

29:52.590 --> 29:55.360
Once they come over
that fence that's when we come in

29:55.426 --> 29:56.294
that's when we go to work.

29:58.062 --> 30:00.965
Honestly, I love it when I catch narcotics.

30:01.766 --> 30:05.804
Knowing that's a load of drugs
that won't be going to some school,

30:05.970 --> 30:08.106
hopefully won't be going to some kid.

30:08.439 --> 30:12.043
I like to think if I can keep one kid
from not taking that first...

30:12.510 --> 30:15.180
trying marijuana, something like that.
I've done my job.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.367
[narrator]
The mules have made it over the wall,

30:36.634 --> 30:39.571
but they still have
to trek over 150 miles

30:39.637 --> 30:42.273
to the pre-arranged meeting point,
near the i8.

30:48.213 --> 30:51.449
[drug mule]  Next we have to cross 
the mountains, which are very high,

30:52.483 --> 30:54.118
and there are cameras
and sensors everywhere.

31:28.386 --> 31:31.456
We have a group that was spotted
down close to the border

31:31.522 --> 31:33.691
that are actually carrying dope.

31:34.425 --> 31:36.527
They had them headed east.

31:37.528 --> 31:41.165
[narrator]  Border Patrol agents Corbett,
Lake and Hernandez...

31:41.232 --> 31:44.636
are tracking a group of mules
who have tripped the motion sensor .

31:47.338 --> 31:48.506
[Lake]
Right now we're trying to figure out

31:48.573 --> 31:49.741
which canyon they're in.

31:49.807 --> 31:52.310
They could be in this one
or one to the east ,

31:52.377 --> 31:54.913
so we're trying to figure out
which one they're going to.

31:58.983 --> 32:00.485
[Corbett]
It's always a competition between us

32:00.551 --> 32:03.054
and, you know, the narcotics smugglers.

32:03.121 --> 32:06.424
Are we two steps ahead
or are they two steps ahead of us?

32:27.145 --> 32:29.547
[Corbett]  You do have more
of a drive to catch those narcotics

32:29.614 --> 32:31.883
because, you know,
for the most part, aliens,

32:31.950 --> 32:34.485
you're talking about people
that are coming here to find work

32:34.552 --> 32:36.220
and things like that.

32:37.055 --> 32:39.691
Narcotics, you know,
when you have kids and things,

32:39.791 --> 32:42.360
I think your motivation
is a little bit different.

32:42.660 --> 32:43.795
[Corbett] This right here, right?

32:44.429 --> 32:47.498
[Lake]  It looks just like 
a regular shoe print without the groove.

32:48.066 --> 32:49.067
The sign here...

32:49.133 --> 32:51.602
It could be two days,
it could be like a week.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.376
[Corbett]  We'll have to find something
that's a little more conclusive.

33:03.381 --> 33:07.385
Alright. So this is what they're trying
to use to conceal their actual footprint

33:07.952 --> 33:09.187
in the terrain.

33:09.954 --> 33:12.156
[narrator]
There are further signs of the mules

33:12.557 --> 33:14.058
and they look fresh.

33:19.063 --> 33:22.066
[Corbett]  In my mind, as an agent,
there's nothing more rewarding

33:22.133 --> 33:25.236
than what we call, "cutting a group,"

33:25.303 --> 33:28.840
which is finding some type
of sign on your own,

33:28.940 --> 33:32.443
tracking that group all the way out
and catching that group.

33:33.811 --> 33:37.448
They're  guiding off of that huge peak
over to the north of us. You can see it.

33:37.648 --> 33:38.783
Vergeda peak.

33:39.584 --> 33:41.352
And they're pretty much
guiding off of that.

33:41.419 --> 33:45.056
That's one of the areas where the scouts
will set up with radios and binos

33:45.523 --> 33:46.724
and look out for us.

34:19.657 --> 34:23.528
Watch out, pigs on the 300, watch out.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.930
I'll copy you, so you can go ahead.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.933
Stay there, wait there,
I'll tell you when.

34:33.971 --> 34:37.475
From here, I can get a good view
of their way in and watch their backs.

34:37.542 --> 34:41.112
We lookouts have to guide
the people who are walking,

34:41.179 --> 34:42.980
while also protecting ourselves,

34:43.047 --> 34:45.016
but we always keep one step ahead.

34:47.351 --> 34:51.222
[narrator]  Lookouts spend up to two weeks
at a time hiding in the mountains.

34:52.490 --> 34:55.093
Cartel runners bring them food and water.

34:56.928 --> 35:01.532
In a fortnight, I can earn $10,000,
or I might not earn a peso.

35:01.599 --> 35:06.404
I like the adrenaline, I like it a lot.
And if they didn't pay, I'd still do it.

35:13.511 --> 35:16.414
[narrator]
Agent Lake sees movement on the horizon.

35:16.481 --> 35:18.449
It could be smugglers.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.654
[Lake]  Which route, which route?

35:23.721 --> 35:25.723
[Corbett] They went towards the gate, man.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.593
[narrator]
Agent Corbett tries to intercept them.

35:29.427 --> 35:31.696
[Lake]
Be careful at the gate, use your weapon.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.167
[Esteban]
The pigs are moving, the pigs are moving.

35:36.234 --> 35:39.904
Go single file,
I'll let you know when to go.

35:41.205 --> 35:44.342
[Corbett] Just a little bit east of it,
they just dropped out of sight.

35:45.409 --> 35:48.946
Alright, now they're hanging
a little more to the west.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.582
Tell me, was it just the one?

35:52.750 --> 35:54.519
[Lake]  Yeah, all I saw was the one.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.454
[Corbett] I lost them.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.933
[mule]  We know straight away
when the Border Patrol are walking nearby.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.836
We simply listen and go.

36:12.069 --> 36:15.640
We hide everything away,
protected by branches, and we get away.

36:15.973 --> 36:19.443
We then wait until they've gone
to return to that spot.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.016
[Corbett]
They just... That group we believe

36:25.082 --> 36:27.051
that they ended up going back south.

36:27.118 --> 36:30.521
We looked everywhere north.
We cut a lot of these trails

36:30.588 --> 36:32.490
and I think we eliminated a lot of it,

36:32.557 --> 36:37.061
so they're going to be back south.
FYI, I'm sure they're going to try...

36:37.195 --> 36:40.331
another push here before too long.
Just keep an eye out.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.103
[narrator]  The mules have retreated...

36:46.337 --> 36:47.171
to wait.

36:48.606 --> 36:53.911
[Corbett] This is Corbett and Lake,
signing out for the day.

36:54.779 --> 36:55.813
Happy hunting.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.483
[narrator]  ...until the border patrol 
agents go off shift.

37:09.727 --> 37:13.564
[Esteban] It's all clear, 
go ahead, let's go, move it!

37:14.332 --> 37:17.768
It's all clear, okay. Let's go.

37:37.655 --> 37:40.291
[narrator]
After the mountains comes the desert.

37:40.958 --> 37:43.628
The Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation.

37:44.562 --> 37:47.565
Over 4000 square miles of scorched earth.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.668
With temperatures reaching 50 degrees.

37:51.302 --> 37:55.373
The mules' biggest fear now,
is death by dehydration.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.811
They have enough water for five days,

38:02.079 --> 38:04.415
but they wouldn't be the first to run out.

38:24.001 --> 38:26.070
[narrator]
With miles of open desert to cross,

38:26.137 --> 38:28.406
the mules are seriously exposed,

38:28.973 --> 38:30.675
especially from the air.

38:40.284 --> 38:42.920
[narrator]
Air operations director Mitchell Pribble

38:43.087 --> 38:45.423
is on a reconnaissance mission.

38:56.567 --> 39:00.371
[Pribble]  We had a group of suspected
marijuana smugglers on camera.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.674
The first detection was
about an hour and a half ago

39:03.774 --> 39:06.711
and the most recent one was
about 15 minutes ago, on camera.

39:07.345 --> 39:11.482
[Pribble]  We have three ground units
on ATVs responding.

39:12.583 --> 39:13.551
[narrator]  Meanwhile...

39:13.718 --> 39:17.088
Ludo's mules know
that eyes will be searching for them.

39:17.588 --> 39:19.557
[mule]  The helicopter
is the most difficult to get past.

39:20.257 --> 39:23.194
It can locate you easily
as you're more clearly visible from above.

39:23.260 --> 39:27.465
We have to hug the tree trunks,
without moving or looking up.

39:30.701 --> 39:35.339
[Pribble]  So, basically we're trying
to cut out in front of the agents

39:35.406 --> 39:37.575
unless they get in here and cut sign.

39:37.641 --> 39:40.911
So, we can determine a direction
to travel from the last known point.

39:40.978 --> 39:43.547
The last coordinates had...

39:45.616 --> 39:49.353
In our area of operation,
it's primarily the Sinaloa cartel.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.524
Within that cartel there are several,
you know,

39:53.624 --> 39:55.760
drug trafficking organizations, DTOs.

39:55.826 --> 39:59.096
They'll guide the groups
and tell them when to lay up

39:59.263 --> 40:01.132
as agents approach.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.103
So, that's what a lay up looks like.
You can see all the trash

40:06.170 --> 40:07.505
and all the water bottles.

40:08.339 --> 40:11.108
[narrator]  There's evidence
that mules have recently come this way.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.478
[Pribble]  They'll come and get underneath
the trees and lay in here...

40:14.912 --> 40:17.882
rest, usually eat,
and then they'll start back

40:17.948 --> 40:20.351
on their smuggling attempt.

40:21.118 --> 40:23.821
I've got a backpack down here
that looks fairly new

40:23.888 --> 40:26.657
Doesn't have any bodies with it,
though, just the backpack.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.366
Some water bottles.

40:36.333 --> 40:38.569
There's batteries here
in the bottom of this wash.

40:39.069 --> 40:42.773
The batteries are to run the radios
that they'll use, and cell phone chargers.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.311
[ATV operator]
I got at least one small bundle.

40:48.679 --> 40:51.048
[Pribble] Nice. 
I knew they were down there.

40:52.016 --> 40:55.453
I'm going to start working away from you,
see if we can locate the rest of this.

40:56.387 --> 40:57.221
Alright. 10-4.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.625
[AVT operator]  There is some water 
in there that I just splashed as well.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.496
When we f ind water bottles
that still have water in them

41:05.729 --> 41:09.934
that tells us we're close to the group
because they rarely drop their water.

41:12.536 --> 41:16.640
[Pribble] So, we know the bodies are here.
They've gotta be right here in this area.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.179
We almost got a bundle
out the right side of the aircraft

41:22.246 --> 41:23.714
underneath this  palo verde.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.652
[AVT operator]  It's a food bundle.

41:32.356 --> 41:36.093
[narrator]  Finally, one of the officers
on the ground gets a break.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.264
[Pribble] Okay, I've got you. I've got you.

41:40.764 --> 41:41.999
He's got a body.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.902
Well, if there's one body here
there's others.

41:44.969 --> 41:47.104
And 347's got bodies up here.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.940
They just gave up.
That was just a give up.

41:55.913 --> 41:58.883
Okay, we're up to a total of three.
Soft count of three.

42:00.985 --> 42:02.720
[narrator]  But these aren't mules.

42:03.287 --> 42:05.222
[Pribble]
As it turns out, it looks like what we

42:05.289 --> 42:07.992
interdicted was a scout resupply.

42:09.226 --> 42:11.161
[narrator]  They're cartel runners.

42:13.330 --> 42:18.002
They were carrying batteries
to run their radios and phones.

42:18.469 --> 42:20.070
[narrator]
They were carrying food for the scouts

42:20.137 --> 42:21.572
and they were carrying water
for the scouts.

42:23.407 --> 42:25.743
[narrator]
They'll be taken back to the CBP base,

42:26.043 --> 42:28.646
questioned, and then sent
to a deportation camp.

42:42.192 --> 42:44.895
[Carlos]
The cartel members on the other side.

42:45.262 --> 42:49.700
We call them on a phone number,
say we'll be in such place at such time,

42:50.067 --> 42:51.869
and they come get us.

42:53.971 --> 42:56.574
[narrator]
The mules have finally made it to the i8,

42:58.375 --> 43:00.210
and met the cartel taxi.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.213
[Esteban]  Go ahead, go ahead.

43:03.914 --> 43:06.183
[mule]  We're arriving at our destination
with the cargo.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.353
Great! Great! You arrived safe?

43:09.420 --> 43:10.254
[mule] Yes.

43:11.522 --> 43:12.590
Over and out, 10-4.

43:15.659 --> 43:18.495
[narrator]  They're on their way
to a safe house in Phoenix,

43:19.163 --> 43:21.198
along with the marijuana shipment.

43:32.109 --> 43:35.479
[narrator]  The weed will now
be distributed to the cartel's dealers,

43:35.546 --> 43:37.748
in cities across the US.

43:47.424 --> 43:50.327
[mule]  All year round, all year round,
they send drugs into the United States .

43:51.428 --> 43:53.931
The one who walks it, the one
who delivers it, the one who receives it.

43:55.499 --> 43:59.003
It's a chain and we're all
on the same side.
