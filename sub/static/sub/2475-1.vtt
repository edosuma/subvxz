Nica?

01:15.200 --> 01:18.787
Nica. There's somebody
at the door.
I'm busy.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.039
(RINGING CONTINUES)

01:20.539 --> 01:21.957
Nica, please.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.544
God!

01:27.170 --> 01:29.506
What are you doing
that's so important?

01:29.548 --> 01:31.592
I was playing solitaire.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.134
SARAH: The computer cheats,
you know.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.261
Yeah, well,
I'm used to that.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.351
Morning.
Hi.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.186
Got a delivery
for Mrs. Sarah Pierce?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.396
I'll... I'll sign for it.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.188
Cool.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.274
Whoa.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.152
You know, you don't
look like a Mrs.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.821
(CHUCKLES) Oh, I'm...

01:52.863 --> 01:55.365
I'm not. It's for my mother.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.159
Oh, God. I'm back
living with
my mother, too.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.954
It's just a fucking
nightmare, right?

01:59.995 --> 02:00.996
(CHUCKLES)

02:01.830 --> 02:03.248
(SOFTLY) You have no idea.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.168
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.587
I know you.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.338
You do?

02:10.380 --> 02:13.050
Yeah, yeah.
It was, uh, City College.
The Psych Department, right?

02:14.217 --> 02:16.177
That was me.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.097
Well, when'd you graduate?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.181
I didn't.
I never completed my thesis.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.141
Oh, on what?

02:21.934 --> 02:24.185
Uh... Completion anxiety.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.105
Thought only guys got that.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.147
(CHUCKLES)

02:29.066 --> 02:30.275
So, is your mom
home now or what?

02:33.487 --> 02:34.488
Yeah.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.158
Too bad.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.289
Well, uh, see you around.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.167
Bye.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.297
Was that guy
hitting on me?

02:52.339 --> 02:54.591
Baby, you're beautiful.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.218
Thank you.
But I... I think that
guy was hitting on me.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.887
Maybe I should
go ask him out.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.430
(LAUGHS) Nica.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.725
He was just being nice.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.271
I'm sorry.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.691
Oh, honey,
I just don't ever want to
see you get hurt.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.534
I thought you swore off
the Home Shopping Network.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.286
I haven't bought
anything in three weeks.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.746
Maybe you have
a secret admirer.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.166
You sound threatened.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.417
No. Not at all.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.794
I just wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.721
Who's it from?

03:42.305 --> 03:43.264
It doesn't say.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.280
(SCOFFS)

03:59.322 --> 04:00.574
Must be some kind of joke.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.118
I don't get it.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.285
Neither do I.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.288
He's cute.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.250

04:18.341 --> 04:20.052
Alice will love him.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.226
I DVR'd <i> Real Housewives.</i>

04:27.267 --> 04:29.436

07:02.797 --> 07:05.967
I need
an ambulance right away.
It's my mother.

I'm sorry.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.836
She was fine.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.630
She was taking her meds,
she was painting again.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.673
No. No.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.591
She was fine.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.638
How could she
do that, Barbie?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.641
How could she do
that to herself?

10:03.895 --> 10:05.980
You, uh...
You remember Father Frank.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.651
Uh... Yes.
Hello, Father.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.989
I'm so very sorry
for your loss, Nica.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.368
Thank you.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.662
Your sister just
thought it might be
a good idea for me to come.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.290
I appreciate it.

10:25.708 --> 10:29.546
But you know my mother
and I both left
the church a long time ago.

10:29.588 --> 10:30.880
But not in the eyes of God.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.050
BARB: I just thought
it might be nice

10:34.092 --> 10:35.552
for us to have
someone to talk to.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.638
We have each other.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.141

10:43.726 --> 10:46.980
We have to pray for her.
To be forgiven.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.692
She was sick.
You can't judge her.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.903
FATHER FRANK:
No one is judging her.

10:53.945 --> 10:57.365
In fact, the church's
official response to
a situation like this

10:57.407 --> 10:59.326
is not to judge, but to pity.

blame yourself.

might come in.

So?

15:44.193 --> 15:44.985
So.

I think we should
consider selling.

talking about?

15:53.035 --> 15:56.581
Nica, this place
is fabulous.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.793
It's so much closer to us,
we'd get to see
you way more often.

And with your half
of what we could
get for the house,

16:02.253 --> 16:03.713
you'd be set for
the rest of your life.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.300
This isn't about me.
This is about money.

deprive my child.

this is hard.

But do you really think
you can manage
here all by yourself?

16:46.464 --> 16:48.007
Mom would have wanted you
to be taken care of.

to take care of him.

sent here by mistake.
