00:00.001 --> 00:04.101
<i> Previously on</i> Lucifer...
I don't care much for my dad.

00:04.105 --> 00:06.835
But you clearly...
care about yours.

00:06.841 --> 00:09.211
I think he would
be proud of you.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.844
Uriel, that's Azrael's blade.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.006
You're not planning on
taking Mum back to Hell.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.215
That weapon will wipe her
out of existence entirely.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.117
No Heaven, no Hell, just...

00:18.119 --> 00:19.279
gone.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.116
Why do you feel guilty?

00:21.122 --> 00:23.222
<i> Uriel didn't just die.</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:24.524
I killed him.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.385
I need you to be honest with me

00:26.394 --> 00:28.034
about who you are.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.129
No more lies.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.200
Very well.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.901
This is where Lucifer buried
your brother.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.203
Why did he do this?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.044
Lucifer was just trying...
No, Mom.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.140
Not Lucifer. Father.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.212
If he wanted to,
he could have

00:42.209 --> 00:44.209
prevented all of this
from happening.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.581
I'm done trying to please
someone who isn't even here.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.905
What the hell?!

01:12.907 --> 01:15.637
Aah! Get off me!

01:17.078 --> 01:18.608
Help!

01:18.612 --> 01:21.352
Help...!

01:21.348 --> 01:23.418
Stop! Stop!

01:23.417 --> 01:26.147
- Leave her alone!
- Hey, man, stop!

01:33.094 --> 01:35.364
Wait. It's you?

01:35.362 --> 01:37.102
You're kidding me, right?

01:37.098 --> 01:38.758
We can totally work this out.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.610
And so there we were,
the detective and I,

01:55.616 --> 01:58.246
standing in her kitchen, and...

01:58.252 --> 02:00.622
she made me...

02:00.621 --> 02:02.621
a sandwich.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.960
I believe this is the part
where you tell me

02:08.963 --> 02:11.663
it's much more
than just a sandwich.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.304
For example...

02:15.302 --> 02:17.472
maybe it was
a gesture of intimacy.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.141
You know, the slices of bread
representing, perhaps,

02:20.141 --> 02:21.641
the detective's trust.

02:21.642 --> 02:25.242
Or... was it
a mistrustful sandwich?

02:25.246 --> 02:26.276
I...

02:26.280 --> 02:28.110
Doctor, please,

02:28.115 --> 02:30.545
what delicious message
was she sending me?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.245
What about Hitler?

02:33.254 --> 02:35.454
The sandwich is Hitler?

02:35.456 --> 02:38.986
How did you actually
torture Hitler in Hell?

02:38.993 --> 02:41.263
Uh...
I mean, is his cell
next to Idi Amin's?

02:41.262 --> 02:42.492
Or Mussolini's?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.656
Or is there kind of a-a-a...

02:44.665 --> 02:47.025
a tyrant wing in Hell?

02:47.034 --> 02:48.374
Right.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.269
I suppose it was futile of me
to think that you wouldn't want

02:51.272 --> 02:54.272
to discuss the whole...
"I'm really the Devil" thing.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.535
The actual Devil?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.648
Look, I have to say...

02:59.647 --> 03:01.677
I was worried
I'd never see you again.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.152
I thought I'd...

03:03.150 --> 03:05.020
scared you off for good.
Yes,

03:05.019 --> 03:07.149
well, Maze, of all people...

03:07.154 --> 03:09.494
well, of all...

03:09.490 --> 03:11.320
demons...

03:11.325 --> 03:13.525
gave me some needed clarity.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.157
Did she, now?

03:15.162 --> 03:17.162
Yes.
Right. Well,

03:17.164 --> 03:19.034
speaking of clarity,
do you mind if we return

03:19.033 --> 03:20.333
to my current emotional growth?

03:20.334 --> 03:21.704
Oh. Yes.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.172
Sorry.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.370
Apology accepted.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.701
So, um...

03:25.706 --> 03:28.606
what do you think it means?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.313
What about my Uncle Edwin?

03:31.312 --> 03:33.412
Is he down there?
I mean, 'cause he was...

03:33.414 --> 03:34.554
you know....

03:34.548 --> 03:37.378
one... he was one bad mama jama.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.854
<i>I think</i>
<i> I've broken my therapist.</i>

03:39.853 --> 03:42.093
And now she's somewhere
to the left of totally useless

03:42.089 --> 03:44.059
and to the right
of babbling lunatic.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.058
Oh, so she's you
in a skirt.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.990
Very funny. This is
serious, Detective.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.895
I'm actually
a bit worried for her.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.497
Hmm, I'm sure
she'll be fine,

03:51.498 --> 03:53.668
but if you need anyone
to talk to, I'm here.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.767
This is actually something
I can't discuss with you.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.399
What? I'm sure
I can handle it.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.844
I've seen all your
ugly parts by now.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.369
Not even close,
I'm afraid.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.014
Saved by the Douche.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.239
Our victim's name
is Maddie Howard.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.405
She was attacked when
she left her apartment.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.953
The assailant chased
her down the alley

04:07.948 --> 04:09.408
and stabbed her
repeatedly.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.076
19 times, to be exact.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.015
Overkill is usually a
crime of passion-- they probably

04:14.021 --> 04:15.021
knew each other.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.262
She was killed
in broad daylight?

04:16.257 --> 04:17.416
There must have been witnesses.
Yeah,

04:17.423 --> 04:19.024
a bunch,
but depending on who you ask,

04:19.026 --> 04:20.755
the killer was a male
who's either Hispanic,

04:20.761 --> 04:23.261
Caucasian or black, short
or tall, brown or blond hair,

04:23.264 --> 04:24.934
or completely bald.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.932
So we're dealing
with a shapeshifter.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.274
Well, eyewitness testimonies
can be unreliable.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.440
Yeah, people's <i> ojos </i>
go a little <i> loco.</i>

04:31.438 --> 04:34.308
Evidence, however,
does not lie.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.138
We got substantial bruising
to the skin,

04:37.144 --> 04:40.314
blade penetrated not only
soft tissue but also bone.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.454
So the killer was
big and strong.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.449
Also, blond head hair,
so odds are really good

04:45.452 --> 04:48.152
we're looking for a white guy.
- Hey, guys.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.315
Got something over here. Tourist
caught the beginning moments

04:50.324 --> 04:51.964
of the attack
in the background of a photo.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.289
Did you get
a look at the killer?

04:53.294 --> 04:55.464
No, but look at this-- we got
a good look at the weapon.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.962
Pretty insane.
Looks like a movie
prop or something.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.066
Can't be.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.327
What do you mean,
"Can't be"?

05:01.335 --> 05:04.065
A movie prop. Those things
are rubber, aren't they?

05:04.071 --> 05:05.341
What?

05:05.339 --> 05:07.169
I have to go.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.923
I don't really have time
for a hike, Lucifer.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.819
Bounty business
is booming, okay?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.162
So this better
be important.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.387
It is.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.330
Is this...?

05:31.332 --> 05:34.472
Where Lucifer
buried Uriel. Yeah.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.097
Okay.

05:38.105 --> 05:42.065
So if you two want to cry
it out, I'll be in the car.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.841
What's happened, Lucifer?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.376
Well, someone dug up the grave.
Yeah,

05:47.381 --> 05:48.851
I can see that.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.019
But why?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.118
Uriel's body is still there.
Yes,

05:53.120 --> 05:55.220
but Azrael's blade isn't.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.890
I believe the weapon
of the Angel of Death

06:01.895 --> 06:04.395
is in human hands.

06:15.142 --> 06:19.212
So let me get this straight:
in human hands, Azrael's blade

06:19.213 --> 06:20.383
<i> wants</i> to kill?

06:20.381 --> 06:22.381
It demands to
be used to...

06:22.383 --> 06:24.383
to fulfill its purpose.
Humans are more...

06:24.385 --> 06:27.385
malleable than we are,
so it whispers in their ears,

06:27.388 --> 06:30.258
beckons to be held-- it takes
any reason someone might want

06:30.257 --> 06:32.257
to hurt another and...
Amplifies it

06:32.259 --> 06:34.159
a thousandfold.
- So if someone

06:34.161 --> 06:35.231
leaves the toilet seat up...

06:35.229 --> 06:37.059
Trip to stabby town, yes.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.234
That's one angry-ass knife.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.333
Yes, well,

06:40.334 --> 06:42.574
it was stolen from
the Angel of Death.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.899
Sis is no sweet peach, is she?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.065
Listen, we're wasting time here.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.173
We need to find the blade.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.514
Why?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.409
So a few meter maids
bite the dust, who cares?

06:50.411 --> 06:52.181
People off each other
all the time.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.249
No, Maze, you
don't understand.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.178
This will accelerate.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.183
Passing from human to human,
leaving an unimaginable trail

06:59.186 --> 07:00.686
of destruction in its wake.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.417
Yes, nasty little thing.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.264
We need to retrieve it.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.929
Oh, I'm so glad you're
on board with this, Luci.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.099
I mean, who would've thought
that bringing celestial objects

07:11.098 --> 07:13.928
to Earth might lead
to such destruction?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.374
Ooh, I like the smug.

07:15.369 --> 07:16.939
Much sexier than the earnest.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.437
I'm just surprised that
you would actually take

07:18.439 --> 07:20.209
a little bit of responsibility.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.607
I thought an unmarked grave
in the middle of nowhere

07:21.608 --> 07:22.608
would be safe enough.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.439
Clearly I was wrong.

07:24.445 --> 07:27.105
But... I clean up my messes.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.445
Well, good luck, you two.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.223
You'll want to help, Maze.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.321
No, thanks.

07:35.322 --> 07:38.222
Let me remind you, I have a job.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.455
And let me remind you that the
blade doesn't just kill humans.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.732
It also obliterates
celestial beings,

07:43.730 --> 07:45.630
including demons.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.972
So, say the detective were to
find it and bring it home...

07:47.968 --> 07:49.968
I get snuffed out
for not doing the dishes.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.100
Which is why

07:51.104 --> 07:52.474
the detective can't be part
of this investigation.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.643
Now,

07:53.640 --> 07:57.340
I'll need you two
to move Uriel's body.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.414
Somewhere it won't be
found this time.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.652
Very well.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.121
And one note,

08:06.119 --> 08:08.149
you're to do so without
disturbing the grave site

08:08.155 --> 08:11.055
in the slightest, specifically
that footprint there.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.362
Why?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.060
Because I'm going to get an
expert to help me examine it.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.626
<i> You need a favor?</i>

08:20.634 --> 08:25.004
Yes, your scientific expertise
on a discreet matter.

08:25.005 --> 08:25.995
Mm.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.336
Paternity test?

08:27.341 --> 08:29.671
What? Do I look like someone
who'd be so irresponsible?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.183
Uh, regardless, if
you do this favor for me,

08:33.179 --> 08:34.679
then I'll do a favor
for you in return.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.150
Lucifer,

08:36.149 --> 08:39.549
the whole point of a favor is
to do it for free, okay?

08:39.553 --> 08:43.123
And then you just trust the love
will come back to you somehow.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.493
Favors are about faith.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.791
Ugh. Please don't
ruin favors for me.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.063
Look, come on, I insist.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.061
Tit for tat.

08:49.062 --> 08:53.162
Fine, um...

08:53.166 --> 08:55.696
Well, there is something
that I would like.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.802
Mm?

08:56.803 --> 08:59.203
But I'm not sure
you can handle it.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.466
Oh, well, now I'm intrigued.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.205
I mean, it might be a little...

09:03.210 --> 09:05.680
inappropriate among colleagues.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.709
Oh, right, even better.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.554
Well, why don't you, uh...

09:09.550 --> 09:11.380
Well...
- Okay, so...

09:11.385 --> 09:13.615
Oh.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.234
Oh, no, no.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.229
Definitely not.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.060
You're the one
who wanted tit for tat.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.725
Yes, if only
it were that simple.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.767
All right, fine.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.742
You have a deal.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.210
Gosh, you're a nasty
little nerd, aren't you?

09:45.619 --> 09:48.189
Right. Here we are.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.088
Does your favor
involve killing me?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.459
I'm just kidding, no.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.360
I need you to do your
forensic whatnots

09:55.362 --> 09:58.132
and work out
what disturbed this area.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.261
Uh, you mean this empty grave?

09:59.266 --> 10:01.226
Look,

10:01.234 --> 10:03.374
you said to me that favors
were about faith, right?

10:03.370 --> 10:04.600
Yeah.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.435
Well, I'm asking you
to have faith in me.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.870
And know that I wouldn't ask
anything untoward of you.

10:08.875 --> 10:12.775
You know, when you use my own
words against me like that,

10:12.779 --> 10:14.309
it's actually
really hard to say no.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.614
I know.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.116
There's some very interesting
footprints over there.

10:18.118 --> 10:22.488
Well, it looks like
we got a man's sneaker.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.759
Okay, I'll take a mold,
but assuming

10:24.758 --> 10:27.128
it's one of the major brands,
I mean, you're looking at a pool

10:27.127 --> 10:29.387
of, like, two million dudes
in L.A.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.156
Maybe 10,000 robust ladies.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.895
Well, I was hoping for something
a little more specific.

10:34.901 --> 10:38.441
Thai's not how
analytical science works.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.138
Whoa.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.841
Someone tried to burn something.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.248
It looks like there's
writing on one s...

10:47.247 --> 10:49.407
side.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.676
Yeah, I should be able to
reconstruct this at the lab.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.445
Ah, excellent.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.823
Right, whilst you do that,
I'll get back to the detective.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.662
Oh, and remember...

10:57.658 --> 10:59.288
Yeah, don't tell anyone

10:59.292 --> 11:01.532
about your super creepy
non-grave grave.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.898
Got it.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.832
<i> So you worked here</i>
<i> with the deceased?</i>

11:08.835 --> 11:11.165
We didn't just work together.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.471
I mean, Maddie was a friend.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.443
The person who introduced me
to the Glory Way.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.713
God, I can't believe
that she's dead.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.713
I'm sorry.
The glory what?

11:21.715 --> 11:22.945
The glory hole.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.179
The Glory Way.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.324
Ah.
Developed by

11:25.318 --> 11:27.518
our guru, Jenson Glory.

11:27.521 --> 11:31.521
The Glory Way is a mind
and body sensibility system

11:31.525 --> 11:33.855
designed to reveal what we call

11:33.860 --> 11:35.690
the "home you."

11:35.696 --> 11:37.856
Right. Do people
actually believe

11:37.864 --> 11:39.504
the word salad that
you're selling?

11:39.499 --> 11:40.669
'Cause, I mean, look,

11:40.667 --> 11:42.727
I enjoy a taut,
spandex-wrapped backside

11:42.736 --> 11:44.366
as much as the next chap,

11:44.371 --> 11:47.211
but that was one large helping
of spiritual gobbledy-gook.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.507
Follow Jenson's teachings and
you <i> will</i> uncover your true self.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.879
And what if

11:50.877 --> 11:54.307
your true self is a 400-pound
nimrod with flatulence issues?

11:54.314 --> 11:57.584
Just saying. Some things
are better left buried.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.584
Given the specifics
of the murder,

11:59.586 --> 12:02.716
we're looking for someone who
had a real hatred for Maddie.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.393
Does anyone come to mind?

12:04.391 --> 12:08.561
No. Maddie was a wholesome soul,
a true light.

12:08.562 --> 12:09.892
What about petty grievances?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.596
Perhaps Maddie drank
someone's probiotic smoothie

12:11.598 --> 12:14.228
or did one too many peacock
poses for someone's taste?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.374
Lucifer.
No.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.768
Just... think.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.770
There must be
some little disagreements.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.412
So why don't you
write us up a list?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.837
Anyone who so much as raised
a patchouli-scented eyebrow

12:22.843 --> 12:24.743
in Maddie's direction
could be the killer.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.435
See...
Excuse us.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.584
That's not the profile

12:29.583 --> 12:31.423
of the murderer
we're investigating.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.918
I'm just being thorough,
Detective.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.619
Like you said, "Shake the bushes
until the truth flies free."

12:36.623 --> 12:38.463
I don't think
I've ever said that before.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.458
No?
Uh-uh.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.730
Oh. Perhaps it was Ms. Lopez.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.929
Mm. You've been spending
a lot of time with Ella.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.272
You know, working
together, I mean.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.398
Not particularly.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.943
Hmm.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.268
Shall we see
how this list is getting on?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.644
Mm-hmm.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.053
Glad to see you're
hard at work.

13:02.048 --> 13:05.948
You know, studies show that the
brain does some of its best work

13:05.952 --> 13:07.422
when it's not trying.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.790
That's why great ideas come
in the shower.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.590
For me, it's
usually women.
Hmm.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.961
Any progress so far?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.489
Damn straight.
Hmm.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.664
I...

13:15.662 --> 13:18.962
rehydrated that burnt piece
of paper

13:18.965 --> 13:20.725
we found
at your super creepy place

13:20.734 --> 13:22.304
using polyvinyl acetate.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.802
Oh, it's easy
for you to say.
I ran these pieces

13:24.805 --> 13:26.395
through a pattern
recognition program,

13:26.406 --> 13:27.936
and I found two things.

13:27.941 --> 13:31.341
First...

13:31.344 --> 13:34.454
what looks to be a map

13:34.447 --> 13:37.447
leading from downtown L.A. to
that exact spot you took me to.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.980
Right. What was
the second thing?

13:39.986 --> 13:42.616
Some business logo
of a law firm.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.692
What law firm?

13:49.596 --> 13:51.996
Bloody hell.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.843
I said no interruptions,
so unless

13:59.840 --> 14:01.840
you're that broad-shouldered
intern from this morning...

14:01.842 --> 14:03.472
Hello, Mum.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.876
Oh.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.338
Hello, son.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.676
It appears you've been busy.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.362
I was getting bored
with my mate and offspring,

14:17.357 --> 14:20.117
so I thought
I'd dive into my employment.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.686
Not that hard
once you read the law books.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.856
What law books?

14:23.864 --> 14:25.364
Well, all of them.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.625
Took less than a weekend

14:26.633 --> 14:28.473
<i>with</i> time to teach the hubby

14:28.468 --> 14:29.868
new tricks.

14:29.870 --> 14:33.400
Have you ever heard of something
called the reverse cowgirl?

14:33.406 --> 14:34.866
Well, I'm thrilled,

14:34.875 --> 14:36.465
Mum, really, I am.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.636
Here you are studying law
<i> and</i> the Kama Sutra.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.906
And drawing maps
to Uriel's grave!

14:46.753 --> 14:48.753
Did someone find the blade?

14:48.755 --> 14:51.515
Oh, so you admit
that you led a human to it?

14:51.524 --> 14:53.394
Well, not <i> a</i> human.
More like ten.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.393
Ten?
Maybe 12. Uh...

14:55.395 --> 14:56.755
But...
15?

14:56.763 --> 14:57.933
Only my craftiest clients.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.061
I mean, I had to make sure
that someone would actually

15:00.066 --> 15:01.926
follow through
and dig the damn thing up.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.495
Why in the world
would you tell people?

15:04.504 --> 15:05.904
What is wrong with you?!

15:05.906 --> 15:08.566
Me? If you didn't want
the blade found,

15:08.575 --> 15:10.905
you shouldn't have left it
in a hole in the ground!

15:10.911 --> 15:13.911
A filled-in hole in
the middle of nowhere,

15:13.914 --> 15:17.424
which no one would've possibly
found if not for <i> you.</i>

15:17.417 --> 15:19.847
Yes. Well... there's that.

15:19.853 --> 15:22.193
Besides, where else
am I gonna hide it?

15:22.188 --> 15:25.718
Lux? You know how many people
traipse through there each week?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.785
Well, I don't know.
Your bedroom, then.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.564
Worse.
Yes.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.762
You are sexually prolific.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.565
Turns out, you get that from me.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.627
Oh, Mum, why?

15:36.636 --> 15:41.566
Why would you release
Azrael's blade into the world?

15:44.110 --> 15:47.780
Because I wanted
to get your father's attention.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.719
Your brother,

15:51.718 --> 15:54.988
Uriel-- my son-- died.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.658
Do you think it's crazy
that I wanted to talk about it?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.457
Mourn with him, maybe?!

15:59.459 --> 16:01.959
I...
So I reached out,

16:01.962 --> 16:04.002
and guess what I got back.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.897
Nothing.
Yes.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.629
Like always.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.974
So I figured that if his toys
started stabbing each other

16:11.972 --> 16:15.472
with a celestial blade, that
maybe he might take a moment.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.475
Humans are dying because of you.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.807
Well, humans die.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.142
They all do eventually.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.076
It's what they were
designed to do.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.152
Yes, but not
like this.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.861
Your vacation here
has changed you.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.987
You seem attached
to these creatures,

16:32.993 --> 16:38.863
and I can't, for the life of me,
figure out why.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.965
Look, you say you want
to stay here on Earth,

16:42.969 --> 16:45.869
to live with your sons, right?

16:45.872 --> 16:50.172
So, a choice: willingly help me
get the blade back,

16:50.176 --> 16:54.676
or I'll send Maze over here
to give you some inspiration.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.820
Hmm. Fine.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.819
You're killing
my reverse cowgirl high.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.161
I...

17:04.156 --> 17:06.017
<i> LAPD</i>

17:06.026 --> 17:08.156
investigation, that's right.

17:08.161 --> 17:12.031
Uh, just your whereabouts
around 7:00 a.m. this morning.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.002
Okay. Can you prove that?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.970
Right.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.539
Thank you.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.867
So the guy that complained

17:18.872 --> 17:20.712
Maddie didn't have enough
cool-down time was

17:20.707 --> 17:23.666
at an ashram in Sedona,
so, not our guy.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.636
My pudding's gone.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.075
I'm sorry?

17:27.079 --> 17:28.550
In the break room fridge,
my pudding--

17:28.548 --> 17:30.178
clearly labeled "Dan"--
it's gone.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.053
Not the first time, either.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.892
Wow. Do you want me
to put some unis on it?

17:34.888 --> 17:37.658
Want me to schedule a stakeout?
Are you even okay?
No, Chloe.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.687
I'm just saying that a man's
snacks-- they're sacred, okay?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.332
Okay.
What up, detective people?

17:41.327 --> 17:44.057
Hey.
Hey.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.934
Are Lucifer and Ella working on
a case that I don't know about?

17:46.933 --> 17:48.703
Mm. Why?

17:48.701 --> 17:52.901
No reason, they just seem to be
spending a lot of time together.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.706
Is someone jealous?

17:55.708 --> 17:56.708
What?

17:56.709 --> 17:57.909
No.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.081
No way.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.949
Gross.
'Cause you can
tell me if you are.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.077
I mean...

18:03.083 --> 18:05.053
we can be there for
each other, as friends.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.721
Even... even if
it's about another guy.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.050
Right, but Lucifer's not
another guy.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.256
He's a weirdo.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.087
This is about partnership,
nothing more.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.293
Partners don't keep secrets.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.864
Well, maybe with Ella,

18:15.862 --> 18:17.632
it's more than just
sex, maybe it's...

18:17.630 --> 18:18.860
a little more serious.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.695
Huh?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.630
No, it's not like Lucifer--
I don't think he...

18:22.635 --> 18:24.265
"Not like Lucifer" wha-what?

18:25.238 --> 18:28.608
Likes poker.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.208
Dan has a monthly game.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.740
Oh, no,
I love a good gamble.

18:31.744 --> 18:32.744
Count me in.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.105
Right, where's that list
of grievances

18:34.114 --> 18:35.614
against poor Maddie?

18:35.615 --> 18:36.745
Oh, it's the...
Yeah.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.119
There-- all right, there you go.
Lovely, thank you.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.778
Why would you do that?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.816
Okay, now you're making it
weird.
You're making it weird.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.821
- You're making it weirder.
- Sorry.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.793
I'll make it weird on your face.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.062
Duncan Watts is our killer.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.261
What makes you say that?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.462
Well, just a hunch.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.932
Duncan Watts.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.644
His offices are upstairs
above the yoga studio.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.637
Oh, and he's Maddie
and Corrina's landlord.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.639
Duncan was apparently upset that
Maddie kept parking in his spot.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.912
He also tried

19:03.910 --> 19:05.910
to have the yoga studio
evicted a few months ago.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.152
Neither of which is really
a reason for 19 stabs.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.648
Yes, but just look at
his stabby mug, hmm?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.420
Blond hair, thick neck, which
suggests Cro-Magnon strength.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.789
Just as our dear
Ella guesstimated.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.318
Ah, "dear Ella," hmm.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.323
Where you going?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.194
I'm just off to see
this Duncan chap.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.333
No.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.657
We will go together
like partners, okay?

19:23.663 --> 19:27.333
Right, yes, I-I just need to
make a quick phone call first.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.003
Oh, okay. No worries.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.673
Private phone call, Detective.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.171
Just give me a moment.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.873
Yeah, sure.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.939
You sure this
is the right place?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.184
Duncan Watts, Maze.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.249
That's the name Lucifer gave me.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.449
I got nothing.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.116
Yeah, me neither.

19:52.125 --> 19:55.055
Even if we find the blade,
it's a temporary fix.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.361
Your mom is the problem.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.697
She released the blade
to create chaos,

19:59.699 --> 20:01.699
and you two respond
by coddling her.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.371
Nobody's coddling her,
all right?

20:03.369 --> 20:05.139
Tell yourself whatever you want,

20:05.138 --> 20:08.368
but you know it's true,
and it explains a lot.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.214
Explains what?

20:11.911 --> 20:13.841
Doesn't really matter anymore,

20:13.846 --> 20:17.316
but, just so you know,
this whole mama's boy thing?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.217
Kind of a turnoff.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.889
Oh, yeah?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.747
Well, your whole
"skintight leather,

20:22.755 --> 20:24.015
hot body everywhere" thing?

20:24.023 --> 20:27.233
Mm-hmm?
It's really not that...

20:27.227 --> 20:31.397
It's not-- it's not
that-that great.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.097
Yeah, it is.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.872
They're here.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.400
Yeah, we should probably
warn Lucifer.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.875
Well?
There's no blade.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.750
Right, use the back way out.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.417
Ah, Detective,

20:53.419 --> 20:55.089
you know, after reflection,
I think you're right.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.918
Parking space thievery is
no motive for murder.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.464
What is going on with you?

20:59.459 --> 21:00.929
First, you're so
eager to get here,

21:00.927 --> 21:03.227
you practically jump out
of my car before I've parked,

21:03.229 --> 21:04.429
and now you want to leave.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.030
What are you hiding?

21:06.032 --> 21:08.472
Hiding?
What would I be hiding?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.228
Blood.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.996
What?

21:21.914 --> 21:24.454
This is Unit 831
requesting backup.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.520
Soul Depot,
15534 Hillgreen Drive.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.397
It's Duncan.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.473
Oh, must've been
some parking space.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.476
Uh, Detective.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.408
Yeah.

21:54.414 --> 21:58.084
Seems this class took corpse
pose quite literally.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.257
So, no sign of
the murder weapon?

22:13.266 --> 22:14.466
Uh-uh.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.097
Are you sure?

22:16.102 --> 22:19.102
Right. Nothing left for us
to do here then, I suppose.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.505
Except for figuring out
how six people were killed.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.107
I'm thinking the
primary killer was Duncan.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.010
Killing Maddie didn't satiate
his anger,

22:26.012 --> 22:28.982
so he went after her clients
and probably got stabbed

22:28.981 --> 22:30.381
when one of them
defended themselves.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.023
I doubt it. More likely
the weapon was passed

22:32.018 --> 22:33.378
from one person to the next

22:33.386 --> 22:35.146
in a game of
murderous hot potato.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.354
That's insane.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.856
Eh.
I know, right?

22:37.857 --> 22:41.127
Totally insane and probably
exactly what happened.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.287
I say this with huge
respect for the dead,

22:43.296 --> 22:45.126
but this case is totally
gonna be a panel

22:45.131 --> 22:46.301
at the next
forensic conference.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.169
Okay. So based
on my preliminary

22:48.167 --> 22:49.467
assessment of
the wounds,

22:49.469 --> 22:52.369
it looks like Duncan
came through the door,

22:52.372 --> 22:54.972
attacked victim number two
with the same weapon

22:54.974 --> 22:56.174
used to kill Maddie Howard.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.875
But Duncan had ligature
marks on his neck,

22:58.878 --> 23:00.538
like someone
strangled him

23:00.546 --> 23:02.076
from behind with
a yoga strap.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.011
Like... this, here.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.246
Oh.
Right?

23:05.251 --> 23:07.221
Which is when
he attacked

23:07.220 --> 23:09.490
victim number three.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.089
But victim number three
had defensive wounds

23:12.091 --> 23:13.391
that matched skin flecks

23:13.393 --> 23:15.363
under the fingernails
of number four,

23:15.361 --> 23:16.891
so I'm thinking Duncan

23:16.896 --> 23:18.396
dropped the knife...

23:18.398 --> 23:22.068
Okay, number four
picked it up, right?

23:22.068 --> 23:25.068
Attacked number three,
like this.
Mmm.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.041
Right, and then
at some point,

23:27.039 --> 23:28.909
number five
got involved.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.408
And so on and so on,
until full yoga massacre.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.341
Oh, that will be
what the panel's called,

23:33.346 --> 23:34.576
Full Yoga Massacre

23:34.580 --> 23:36.250
2016.
Very good.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.179
Okay, so, say that all happened
like you just said it did,

23:38.184 --> 23:39.584
which is crazy.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.445
There are seven mats
and seven bodies.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.024
Yeah. So?

23:43.022 --> 23:44.592
So Duncan was the
pissed off landlord,

23:44.590 --> 23:46.190
not the class attendee.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.292
Subtract him,
we're missing one yogi.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.594
Okay, well, all of
the bodies were situated

23:49.595 --> 23:53.495
around these six mats--
the student mats.

23:54.700 --> 23:59.300
So that could be
the teacher's mat, maybe.

23:59.305 --> 24:01.235
The teacher must
have been here.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.270
Get this.

24:03.276 --> 24:05.206
Teacher training taught by

24:05.211 --> 24:07.241
Jenson Glory himself.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.246
I mean,

24:08.247 --> 24:09.547
his body's not
among the dead.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.079
Could be our
missing victim.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.153
Slash attacker.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.719
Guy's a piece of work.

24:17.723 --> 24:20.623
Jenson Glory, his real
name is Jamie Ostrowski.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.956
Soul Depot is the latest
in a long line of

24:22.962 --> 24:24.632
failed fitness enterprises.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.960
Glory has five fraud lawsuits,

24:26.966 --> 24:29.296
two sexual harassment claims
working their way

24:29.302 --> 24:30.332
through the court system.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.966
Sexual harassment?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.342
Yeah, former assistants.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.470
Both beautiful
young women,

24:35.475 --> 24:36.505
like Maddie.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.339
Oh, and look at the contract
that they sign

24:38.344 --> 24:40.144
when students join Soul Depot.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.346
"I surrender myself
to Soul Depot,

24:42.348 --> 24:43.748
"body, mind and soul,

24:43.749 --> 24:45.979
"and to the only true guru
of health and serenity,

24:45.985 --> 24:48.115
Jenson Glory." Wow.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.320
Pretty much a cult.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.492
Think he brainwashed
his students

24:50.490 --> 24:52.620
into a Jonestown
type thing?

24:52.625 --> 24:54.455
Kind of a stretch, right?

24:54.460 --> 24:55.760
That a yoga pun?

24:55.761 --> 24:58.431
No. It's an honest question.

24:58.431 --> 25:02.001
I mean, drinking cyanide juice
is one thing,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.301
but a bunch of people
stabbing each other?

25:04.303 --> 25:06.173
Totally insane!

25:06.172 --> 25:08.672
A magic blade in Los Angeles

25:08.674 --> 25:11.544
which belongs to
the Angel of Death?

25:11.544 --> 25:14.014
Now, in the hands
of a yogi shyster

25:14.013 --> 25:16.453
who's apparently touchy-feely
in more ways than one.

25:16.449 --> 25:18.019
Okay, can we go back

25:18.017 --> 25:19.517
to the Angel of Death?

25:19.519 --> 25:21.189
Is he... uh,

25:21.187 --> 25:22.547
is he another one of
your brothers?

25:22.555 --> 25:24.355
Sister, actually.

25:24.357 --> 25:27.157
The Angel of Death is a chick?

25:27.159 --> 25:28.189
Yes, I sort of wish we were

25:28.194 --> 25:29.534
back to talking in metaphors.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.529
That makes two of us.
Because I do actually

25:31.531 --> 25:33.531
have things that I'd like
to talk about, Doctor.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.703
Oh. Oh, yes. I'm so sorry.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.171
Yes. Please.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.469
Right.

25:38.471 --> 25:41.211
So, my mum asked me why
I care so much

25:41.207 --> 25:42.367
about these people dying

25:42.375 --> 25:45.305
and I'm not sure I know.

25:45.311 --> 25:48.351
I mean, it's not like
I know them personally,

25:48.347 --> 25:50.047
and Maze is right--

25:50.049 --> 25:52.549
even without Azrael's blade,
humans are capricious.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.052
Hell,

25:54.053 --> 25:55.523
they're willing to
trade their souls

25:55.521 --> 25:57.391
to lose unsightly tummy fat,
but...

25:57.390 --> 26:00.690
So...

26:00.693 --> 26:02.533
why should I feel bad?

26:02.528 --> 26:03.728
Why should I feel responsible?

26:03.729 --> 26:05.329
And... why

26:05.331 --> 26:07.101
am I doing my
own therapy?

26:07.099 --> 26:09.329
Lucifer, I'm sorry.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.435
I'm trying to digest
this whole thing

26:11.437 --> 26:13.567
myself.
And, well,

26:13.573 --> 26:17.743
there is no listing in the DSM-5
for Azrael's Blade Anxiety.

26:17.743 --> 26:18.783
Oh.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.608
Excuse me.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.208
Ah,

26:24.216 --> 26:26.746
the guru with the doo-doo juju
has been picked up.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.192
So, I'm afraid that's all we've
got time for today.

26:30.590 --> 26:34.530
Just... call me if you
need to reschedule.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.761
I wasn't even
at the studio, actually.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.103
That's not what
the schedule says.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.199
May I have a tea?

26:42.201 --> 26:44.301
Siberian ginseng
if you have it.

26:45.605 --> 26:46.765
Well...

26:46.772 --> 26:48.542
Hello, Richard Simmons.

26:48.541 --> 26:49.741
Sorry I'm late.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.242
Where's the knife?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.883
Who is this tense man?

26:53.879 --> 26:55.279
Okay,

26:55.281 --> 26:56.611
back to the teacher
training class.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.246
Can you prove that
you weren't there?

26:58.250 --> 27:00.320
Of course, there's
a computer system--

27:00.319 --> 27:02.289
all of the teachers have
to swipe a key card.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.118
Even me. Check it.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.663
So, where were you?

27:05.658 --> 27:07.288
Home.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.493
I missed the
last few classes, actually.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.795
I've been... sick.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.897
Obsessing over a
new toy, more like.

27:13.899 --> 27:15.669
What are you talking about?

27:15.668 --> 27:17.768
I'm talking about something
that's probably beckoning you

27:17.770 --> 27:19.240
as we speak.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.468
Whispering to you

27:20.473 --> 27:22.273
to do terrible things.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.584
Wretched, sinful deeds.

27:25.511 --> 27:28.611
That-- that's true...

27:28.614 --> 27:29.684
I-I want...

27:29.682 --> 27:31.422
Go on, tell me. Tell
me what you want,

27:31.417 --> 27:33.277
what you really,
really want.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.545
I want...

27:35.454 --> 27:38.924
a raspberry cream cheese muffin.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.664
And-- and-and

27:40.660 --> 27:41.660
to take this thing...

27:41.661 --> 27:43.331
off!

27:43.329 --> 27:44.829
Oh, my...
Oh.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.360
Expecting twins, are we?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.925
Hey, I backslid
a little bit, all right?

27:48.934 --> 27:50.934
Carbs are the
Devil's spawn, man.

27:50.936 --> 27:52.666
Don't blame your
weaknesses on me.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.442
Huh?
Is that why you
didn't show up

27:54.440 --> 27:56.170
to the class? Because
you gained weight?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.675
Of course. No one's gonna
find their "home self"

27:58.678 --> 28:01.548
from a guru who looks like he
ate all the furniture.

28:01.547 --> 28:02.647
Well, I think I'd
rather be chubby

28:02.648 --> 28:05.178
than a handsy dipstick
in a corset.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.384
That's it.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.515
I want my lawyer now.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.521
Well, don't eat him.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.534
All right, listen,
we searched Glory's house,

28:17.530 --> 28:19.560
his car,
his other car...

28:19.565 --> 28:21.465
there is no blade.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.267
We did find a safe
in the basement.

28:27.573 --> 28:28.713
Pop-Tarts.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.708
Which... you stole?

28:30.710 --> 28:32.210
Ah, I figured
it's a win-win.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.481
I'm saving the evil guru
from future fat,

28:34.480 --> 28:35.480
and, you know,

28:35.481 --> 28:37.551
Pop-Tarts.

28:38.751 --> 28:41.351
Mr. Glory has a second
home in Ventura.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.723
If you wouldn't mind.

28:42.722 --> 28:43.722
Okay, we'll check it out,

28:43.723 --> 28:45.593
but...

28:45.591 --> 28:47.261
Luci, if he's the one
with the blade,

28:47.259 --> 28:48.729
he's much more likely
to go on a killing spree

28:48.728 --> 28:49.958
than to stash it.

29:03.609 --> 29:06.009
Ah. Come back
for your processed pastries?

29:06.011 --> 29:08.411
Ms. Lopez!

29:08.414 --> 29:10.254
Well, this is
a surprise.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.679
Have you found something new?

29:11.684 --> 29:14.694
Oh, I found something all right.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.687
Proof of Bigfoot?

29:16.689 --> 29:18.389
Tread on the shoes
Duncan Watts was wearing

29:18.390 --> 29:19.760
when he was found dead.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.259
Tread that you showed me

29:21.260 --> 29:23.890
at your super weirdo
hole in the ground.

29:23.896 --> 29:27.256
They match, which means
that this case

29:27.266 --> 29:28.266
and your favor

29:28.267 --> 29:29.767
are connected.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.369
Start talkin', dude.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.939
Do you have something to do
with these murders?

29:38.944 --> 29:42.114
Come clean with me.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.154
Or I can't keep this
a secret anymore.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.750
You see, that's just it.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.752
The last person
I came clean with

29:48.754 --> 29:50.154
became a tad untethered.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.286
Dude, I grew up in Detroit.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.291
Look,

29:53.292 --> 29:55.332
all I can tell you is

29:55.327 --> 29:57.957
I'm dealing with a matter
of cosmic importance

29:57.963 --> 30:00.903
and I ask you to indulge me
for just a little longer.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.970
You mean have faith?

30:01.967 --> 30:04.367
Tomato, tomahto.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.304
Well, I guess faith
isn't faith

30:07.306 --> 30:08.736
unless it's tested.

30:08.741 --> 30:10.941
Bring it in.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.183
What? Oh.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.654
Ella.
Detective.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.023
Oh, um...

30:22.021 --> 30:24.021
I was just...

30:24.023 --> 30:26.023
uh, you see,

30:26.025 --> 30:28.785
there's this, uh, store
that has really special...

30:28.794 --> 30:29.794
soap.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.695
And, you know,

30:31.697 --> 30:33.797
but I should really
get going now and...

30:33.799 --> 30:36.329
clean stuff with the soap.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.735
Bye!
Enjoy your shower.

30:39.672 --> 30:42.772
So, um...

30:42.775 --> 30:44.165
to what do I owe
this pleasure?

30:44.176 --> 30:47.036
Jenson's home security system
shows video of him sleeping

30:47.046 --> 30:49.306
during the murders,
so he wasn't lying about that.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.775
We checked the key card system
at Soul Depot,

30:51.784 --> 30:53.354
and guess who was
subbing for Jenson.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.692
Corrina,

30:54.687 --> 30:56.047
Maddie's co-manager.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.315
Right, and where's
Corrina now?

30:57.323 --> 30:58.893
We checked her house,
she wasn't there.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.021
Forensics confirms

31:00.025 --> 31:02.025
that she didn't kill anyone
at Soul Depot,

31:02.027 --> 31:04.027
so she's either running,
hiding or scared.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.029
I put out a BOLO.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.701
Yeah, I don't think Corrina's
the one running this time.

31:08.701 --> 31:09.701
What?

31:09.702 --> 31:12.372
Where are you going?

31:12.371 --> 31:14.401
Hello?

31:30.389 --> 31:32.859
Hello?

31:32.858 --> 31:36.858
Anyone here yielding a
deadly, celestial blade?

31:36.862 --> 31:40.102
Huh? Anyone?

31:40.099 --> 31:42.929
Well, that'll be
a resounding yes.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.270
I-- I don't know what happened.

31:48.274 --> 31:51.414
I was in class
and Duncan barged in.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.040
It was horrible.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.406
All that killing...

31:56.415 --> 31:59.115
and the knife was
on the ground.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.078
It started calling you.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.762
Did I do that?

32:05.758 --> 32:07.928
Yes.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.087
You got retribution
for a grudge, I believe.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.525
But it wasn't an
insignificant grudge, was it?

32:13.532 --> 32:16.602
Did he harass you
like the others?

32:18.771 --> 32:20.901
Or was it worse
than that?

32:20.906 --> 32:22.766
Years ago.

32:22.775 --> 32:26.035
We were alone
in the studio.

32:27.046 --> 32:30.106
I-I-- I said no.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.875
I swear, but he
wouldn't stop.

32:32.885 --> 32:36.145
I-I... I tried to forget. I...

32:36.155 --> 32:38.315
You tried to bury it deep,
get on with your life.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.994
You might have
succeeded,

32:39.992 --> 32:41.062
if not for...

32:42.227 --> 32:43.457
...the blade.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.932
LAPD, hands in the air.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.801
Move away from
the body, Corinna.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.000
Now!
I... I-I killed him.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.102
I-I did this.
I...

32:51.103 --> 32:53.173
Acted in self-defense.

32:53.172 --> 32:56.472
Mr. Glory attacked Corrina
first. She had no choice

32:56.475 --> 32:58.475
but to wield that
knife, Detective.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.477
I think, in this case, justice
has actually been served.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.917
Henderson, take her statement.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.990
Come with me.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.264
Where's the
murder weapon?

33:13.258 --> 33:14.828
What?

33:14.827 --> 33:16.587
Unis shouldn't have bagged
it without taking photos.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.595
They couldn't help themselves.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.957
Anyone else feeling
a murderous urge?

33:20.966 --> 33:24.326
No? The need to slice and dice?

33:24.336 --> 33:26.436
Anyone?

33:26.438 --> 33:29.008
Oh, God.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.406
Oh, no.

33:39.985 --> 33:42.615
Detective Douche...
Daniel. Dan.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.361
Why don't you
put down the knife, hmm?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.187
Bury the proverbial hatchet
and all that?

33:47.192 --> 33:49.892
I mean, I know we've had our
differences in the past, but

33:49.895 --> 33:51.425
we're friends now, right?

33:56.969 --> 33:59.299
You ruined my marriage.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.610
I'll take that as a no.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.549
My life went to hell
when I met you!

34:08.547 --> 34:10.507
Hey! Well, technically, that's
not true, but I understand

34:10.516 --> 34:11.876
the basic metaphor.

34:14.253 --> 34:17.253
Easy with the blade,
Detective.

34:17.255 --> 34:20.156
One deep cut, and yours truly
could be wiped from existence.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.659
Prayers answered.

34:23.262 --> 34:26.161
What...

34:26.165 --> 34:28.025
Okay, Detective,

34:28.033 --> 34:31.233
I can assure you your current
mood will be rectified

34:31.235 --> 34:34.036
by simply putting down
the knife.

34:34.039 --> 34:37.409
My entire life imploded
because of you.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.039
What?
My marriage!

34:40.079 --> 34:42.248
My job.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.447
My snacks.

34:43.449 --> 34:44.579
What?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.583
I know you ate my pudding.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.516
You're really
going to smite me

34:49.521 --> 34:51.460
over a tub of sweetened goo?

34:53.958 --> 34:55.589
You're damn right I am.

34:55.594 --> 34:59.034
Dan... Dan.

34:59.031 --> 35:01.431
Recent friend.
Growing compatriot.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.933
Your marriage
was already on the rocks.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.566
You started cutting procedural
corners way before I arrived,

35:06.572 --> 35:08.072
and as for your pudding...

35:08.073 --> 35:10.943
As for your pudding, I...

35:10.943 --> 35:12.313
Okay, yes.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.211
I sometimes lay waste
to the precinct fridge.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.453
But have mercy, Daniel.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.307
How was I supposed
to know it was yours?

35:17.316 --> 35:20.216
Because it was labeled!

35:26.458 --> 35:29.088
You're fighting the blade,
which indicates a strength

35:29.094 --> 35:32.334
I didn't know you had.
Look at me in the eye.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.061
Look at me.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.627
Your marriage.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.695
Did I ruin it?

35:40.572 --> 35:41.742
No.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.970
No.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.976
We were separated before
Chloe even met you.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.308
And your career?

35:48.313 --> 35:51.083
Palmetto... was all me.

35:51.083 --> 35:53.083
Yeah. Yeah.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.117
W-What are we
doing back here?

36:00.125 --> 36:01.985
Hmm? Oh, just a nice,

36:01.994 --> 36:03.464
intimate chat between friends.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.532
I'm glad you got it
off your chest.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.001
Oh, man, you're bleeding.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.269
What? Oh.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.467
No, it's just
a scratch, really.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.668
Nothing to worry about.
And you?

36:11.670 --> 36:13.140
How are you doing?

36:14.673 --> 36:17.013
I feel great, actually.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.339
Good.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.254
Good talk.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.695
Ah! Good morning,
Detective.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.197
Everything all right?

36:40.199 --> 36:42.169
No. Heads are gonna roll.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.697
First, some tech pulled
the murder weapon

36:44.703 --> 36:47.243
without documentation,
and now it's just gone.

36:47.239 --> 36:50.039
Right. Well,
it's probably for the best.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.212
Nasty bit of steel, anyway.

36:53.078 --> 36:55.248
So, one second
you're obsessed

36:55.247 --> 36:58.047
with the knife,
and now it's just no big deal?

36:58.050 --> 37:00.680
Well, we got the murderer,
didn't we? Job done.

37:00.686 --> 37:03.516
You know, Lucifer...

37:03.522 --> 37:06.392
I thought you and I had
a real moment the other day,

37:06.391 --> 37:07.721
talking about my dad, I...

37:07.726 --> 37:09.556
I thought we
were partners,

37:09.561 --> 37:11.491
but more importantly, friends.

37:15.167 --> 37:17.197
Right.

37:17.202 --> 37:19.602
Is this about me and Ella
in the penthouse?

37:19.605 --> 37:22.565
Look, who you sleep with
is none of my business,

37:22.574 --> 37:23.844
but...

37:23.842 --> 37:26.242
I mean, the lab tech? Really?

37:26.245 --> 37:27.575
It's a little inappropriate.
Well,

37:27.579 --> 37:29.509
much as I love to cross
professional boundaries,

37:29.514 --> 37:31.214
Detective, I can assure you,
everything you saw

37:31.216 --> 37:33.276
was entirely work-related.

37:35.354 --> 37:38.364
Mm-hmm? Is that...
is that the truth?

37:38.357 --> 37:40.087
Always the truth.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.362
Point of pride for me,
Detective.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.591
Gotcha.
But you know,

37:43.595 --> 37:45.355
if you ever did
want to cross boundaries

37:45.364 --> 37:47.734
into "partnered friends
who hang out naked..."
Okay.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.103
Stop talking.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.609
<i> So, global crisis averted?</i>

37:56.608 --> 37:58.678
Yes. For now.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.541
So, we can...

38:01.546 --> 38:04.246
you know, talk about
Caligula, Stalin,

38:04.249 --> 38:05.779
Trump. I mean,

38:05.784 --> 38:08.394
I know he's not dead,
but he's definitely going.
Lucifer,

38:08.387 --> 38:10.447
I owe you an apology.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.560
But in my defense...

38:14.893 --> 38:16.263
...you're the Devil.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.156
Things were much less
complicated when I thought

38:19.164 --> 38:22.904
you were just another
average delusional patient

38:22.901 --> 38:25.641
with a complicated family.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.137
Well, I've never
been "average," Linda.

38:28.140 --> 38:30.270
Mentally, physically--
and as you know--

38:30.275 --> 38:31.505
sexually.

38:31.510 --> 38:34.140
Oh, my God.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.506
I had sex with the Devil.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.575
Many, many times.
And you're welcome.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.754
Okay, now, see,
that I understand.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.653
Narcissistic tendencies rooted

38:44.656 --> 38:46.486
in a complex
paternal relationship

38:46.491 --> 38:48.531
and a disrupted adolescence.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.487
See? Just another
screwed up patient.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.355
And you can treat me as such.

38:54.199 --> 38:55.529
All right.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.804
Let's do this.

39:00.372 --> 39:01.642
The doctor is in.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.540
Lovely.

39:06.178 --> 39:08.178
<i> I really do</i>
<i> have urgent business</i>

39:08.180 --> 39:09.550
to attend to.
Are you certain

39:09.548 --> 39:11.508
that this is the favor
that you desire?

39:11.516 --> 39:14.176
Because, uh, believe me,
when I say the last two times

39:14.186 --> 39:15.516
I've darkened the
doorstep of a church,

39:15.520 --> 39:18.290
insert blood-soaked
carnage here.
Again,

39:18.290 --> 39:19.690
with the drama!

39:19.691 --> 39:22.361
We solved your case,
now I get my favor.

39:22.361 --> 39:24.831
Just go with me, okay?

39:24.830 --> 39:27.700
Look, since the moment
we've met,

39:27.699 --> 39:30.869
okay, I've had this Spidey-sense
that you were...

39:30.869 --> 39:33.869
I don't know,
searching for something.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.472
Right. Spiritual lost and found.
Yes!

39:36.475 --> 39:38.875
And I have found a lot
since I developed a relationship

39:38.877 --> 39:41.707
with the Big Guy,
and... so might you.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.513
Trust me. We're much closer
than you think.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.376
Well, then, no harm, no foul.

39:46.385 --> 39:47.745
I beg to differ.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.493
Oh.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.348
On second thought...

39:51.356 --> 39:53.216
What?

39:53.225 --> 39:56.425
I should at least give someone
a reason to go to confession.

40:09.341 --> 40:10.911
So, where will you put it,
brother?

40:10.909 --> 40:13.379
Somewhere far away
from our mum,

40:13.378 --> 40:15.448
for starters.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.551
Mm!

40:18.550 --> 40:20.620
And speak of the Devil's mum.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.389
Well, that was fast.

40:22.387 --> 40:25.387
You couldn't have waited
a day or two to find it?

40:25.390 --> 40:26.790
There hasn't been nearly
enough carnage.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.562
Now we'll never hear
from your father.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.930
All the killing in the world

40:29.928 --> 40:31.928
may not have gotten
his attention, Mum.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.900
Surely you've
learned that by now.

40:33.899 --> 40:35.529
Uriel was our son.

40:35.534 --> 40:36.804
Your brother.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.642
We should grieve together.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.937
I don't think that's
all this is about.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.539
You want something from Him.

40:43.542 --> 40:44.942
What is it?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.943
What I've always wanted.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.775
I want my family back.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.411
I'm afraid that's not possible.

40:51.416 --> 40:52.546
Oh, but it is.

40:52.551 --> 40:55.751
With my two sons by my side,
a united front,

40:55.754 --> 40:57.954
your father will be forced
to listen to reason.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.716
Force Dad?

40:59.724 --> 41:02.434
I think human delusion
is rubbing off on you, Mother.

41:02.427 --> 41:04.727
Tell her.

41:04.729 --> 41:07.699
Luci, I can't,
because I agree with her.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.674
I thought you were
just Team Mum

41:14.673 --> 41:16.813
because you couldn't
fly her back to Hell.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.978
Since when did you turn?
Now,

41:18.977 --> 41:21.677
more than ever, I know
that humanity and divinity

41:21.680 --> 41:22.680
do not mix.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.851
That... that blade, Luci.

41:24.850 --> 41:28.320
That blade was the last straw.
It shouldn't be here.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.620
<i> We</i> shouldn't be here.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.022
Well,

41:32.023 --> 41:34.823
I am not going back to Hell.
Oh, this isn't about

41:34.826 --> 41:36.526
returning to Hell.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.528
This is about Heaven.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.600
It's about going home.

41:40.599 --> 41:41.869
Home.

41:41.867 --> 41:43.497
For you, maybe.

41:43.502 --> 41:45.772
Neither of you
understand, do you?

41:45.770 --> 41:47.340
You never have.

41:47.339 --> 41:50.609
Hell wasn't home,
and Heaven was...

41:50.609 --> 41:52.009
well... hell!

41:52.010 --> 41:54.340
The only place
I've ever felt

41:54.346 --> 41:56.676
wanted or respected...

41:56.681 --> 41:58.351
Is here?
With humanity?

41:58.350 --> 42:00.920
Yes. This is my home.

42:03.655 --> 42:05.115
Deal with it, Mother.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.761
Fine.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.464
Fine.

42:11.463 --> 42:14.533
No sense arguing.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.473
Time to go.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.741
Careful.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.940
It's sharp.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.710
What's that saying?

42:31.716 --> 42:34.546
"When my dear husband
closes a door,

42:34.553 --> 42:36.623
he opens a window"?

42:38.390 --> 42:40.460
The window just opened.
