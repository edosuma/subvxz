- Half the continental shelf has fissures ... - Vince, it is okay. Why are you so nervous?

03:04.297 --> 03:05.957
Oh, I don't know.

03:05.957 --> 03:08.676
Just relax and enjoy it.

03:11.489 --> 03:13.964
There's a poetry here.

03:25.118 --> 03:29.120
Speedbird, this is Admiral Falco. Are you done with the canvassing?

03:29.121 --> 03:33.018
The survey is negative, Radar is negative

03:33.143 --> 03:37.312
A vast wasteland, Admiral. There's no one around.

03:37.313 --> 03:40.618
Remember lieutenant, This mission is classfied.

03:40.619 --> 03:45.501
Souldn't there be any trouble, the government will deny it's existence.

03:50.060 --> 03:53.038

Speedbird to Admiral. Getting into position. Ready to deploy LFAS.

05:29.303 --> 05:37.086
- On my mark: 3, 2, 1 - And deploy

05:39.136 --> 05:43.525
Speedbirdto Admiral, LFAS has landed and is operational.

05:43.525 --> 05:48.332
You should be receiving signals in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ..

05:48.332 --> 05:50.857
Signals are reached. Do you copy that?

05:58.115 --> 06:01.192
- This is amazing. - Are we recording this?

06:01.193 --> 06:03.965
Cameras 2 and 3, right?

06:06.619 --> 06:09.640
Wait!

06:12.104 --> 06:15.734
- W..W..What. - Something's going on with sonar?

06:17.135 --> 06:20.059
Lieutenant, what's the status of the LFAS?

06:20.060 --> 06:26.605
Sonar levels at 120 decibels and climbing, sir, reaching 130, 140, 150.

06:27.690 --> 06:31.288
Climbing, sir. They're reaching higher. 160...

06:35.936 --> 06:38.890
- What happened? - I don't know.

06:38.891 --> 06:40.630
[rumbling] Wait. What's that noise?

06:40.630 --> 06:42.758
That's the Doria. She's been hit!

06:42.759 --> 06:44.683
- Shh! - What, that rumble?

06:44.683 --> 06:46.450
- Shh!!! - We're going to get out of here. - Shh!!!

06:46.451 --> 06:49.688
- It's the whales. - No, it's not.

06:50.671 --> 06:53.027
Something's messing up the whales' migration pattern.

06:53.027 --> 06:54.952
- Like the Music? - No, something stronger.

06:54.953 --> 06:58.639
Damn it. What was I thinking? Whales don't travel in such big groups.

07:03.702 --> 07:06.142
They're hitting the glacier walls. They're killing themselves. Damn it!

07:06.143 --> 07:08.808
Think. Think. think, think!

07:11.280 --> 07:13.735
There it is!

07:17.001 --> 07:21.858
- It's a transmitter. Son of a bitch, That LFAS! - A What?

07:22.937 --> 07:27.773
A Low-Frequency-Active-Sonar. They're illegal. We're not supposed to be using these.

07:29.257 --> 07:31.761
The wall is shifting.

07:38.628 --> 07:40.810
Holy crap!

08:26.707 --> 08:29.178
You got a tissue?

08:29.179 --> 08:33.235
The thing is, Mr. Haybee, here in Japan they have certain customs.

08:33.236 --> 08:36.508
Yeah, customs. We have customs in the States, too.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.960
[loud thunder] Like urinating on co-workers?

08:39.961 --> 08:42.535
Haven't you guys ever been to a frat party?

08:42.535 --> 08:44.268
You're taking this way too seriously.

08:44.268 --> 08:46.992
My men feel they've been disrespected.

08:46.992 --> 08:48.865
Look, I understand you're upset.

08:49.113 --> 08:52.302
You've got a bunch of crazy sail mates pissing in your little loo.

08:52.303 --> 08:53.831
Here's the thing.

08:53.832 --> 08:55.923
Bigger things are going on here.

08:55.924 --> 08:58.230
Bigger than our own little problems.

08:58.231 --> 09:01.772
So I promise you, if we can just have a sense of humor about this...

09:01.772 --> 09:04.526
The point is as long as we have a sense of humor about this thing.

09:04.527 --> 09:07.944
Everything's gonna work out, I promise.

09:08.295 --> 09:10.187
[explosion & all shouting]Aah!

09:43.425 --> 09:44.629
Thanks, Vince.

09:44.629 --> 09:47.315
Hey. I'm a navigator.

09:50.230 --> 09:51.224
You sure you're all right?

09:51.224 --> 09:52.537
Yeah.

09:52.802 --> 09:54.698
I don't know.

09:54.698 --> 09:56.380
Nightmares.

09:57.008 --> 09:59.947
Yeah, it was the worst one I've ever been through, that's for sure.

10:00.402 --> 10:02.303
- Yeah, and also I... - What?

10:02.837 --> 10:06.169
I don't know. I thought I saw something, something else out there.

10:06.569 --> 10:07.993
Did you..

10:08.207 --> 10:09.396
What?

10:09.396 --> 10:10.959
Never mind.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.978
Must be losing my mind.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.474
Yo. Yo. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:16.474 --> 10:18.384
Hey, what's with the suits?

10:18.385 --> 10:20.246
[no audible dialogue]

10:23.284 --> 10:25.251
Federal land?

10:25.251 --> 10:26.787
Maybe Shamu was a spy.

10:27.372 --> 10:28.215
You coming?

10:28.215 --> 10:31.226
No way. After our stunt, the boss man wants my job.

10:31.226 --> 10:32.173
I'm staying right here.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.099
Oh, you're such a wuss.

10:37.318 --> 10:38.961
- They're okay? Do you hear me? - I need it to be better.

10:38.961 --> 10:40.721
- Whoa. You're late, MacNeil. - Yeah, I know.

10:40.721 --> 10:42.011
That's the third time this week.

10:42.011 --> 10:43.171
Couldn't sleep, Dick.

10:43.171 --> 10:45.513
Get pills, huh?

10:59.571 --> 11:01.261
What a mess.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.966
That's your professional opinion?

11:02.966 --> 11:05.269
Propeller. That's tanker size.

11:05.269 --> 11:08.142
It's the only explanation for a wound that size.

11:12.498 --> 11:16.106
Looks like the same type injury found on that great white up the coast.

11:22.363 --> 11:23.356
What'd did I miss?

11:23.357 --> 11:25.807
Any kind of career advancement.

11:25.808 --> 11:27.578
Poor guy.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.061
Say, can I borrow this?

11:38.568 --> 11:40.091
That's weird.

11:40.091 --> 11:42.296
Does anyone have any forceps? I want to get a sample of this.

11:42.296 --> 11:44.246
What's going on?

11:45.101 --> 11:49.972
Tears in his flesh didn't come from anything mechanical. This wound's organic.

11:49.972 --> 11:52.805
Organic, Christ. Emma, Do you know how you sound?

11:52.805 --> 11:55.983
You name one thing in that ocean that causes damage like that.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.063
Besides you.

11:57.063 --> 11:59.827
Look, I didn't steal the Doria. I just borrowed it.

11:59.827 --> 12:03.306
Yeah, half a million dollars of damage to the mini-sub that you borrowed.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.256
The board is furious.

12:05.256 --> 12:08.132
There were over 50 of them, Dick, going nuts.

12:08.132 --> 12:10.431
- Whales don't behave like that. - You were off course!

12:10.431 --> 12:12.621
You were wandering around places you shouldn't even be.

12:12.621 --> 12:14.709
Yeah, and thank God I was.

12:14.709 --> 12:18.054
- Otherwise, we never would have discovered the effects of the sonar... - Quiet.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.510
Now listen to me.

12:19.510 --> 12:21.965
My ass is on the line. Do you hear me?

12:21.965 --> 12:25.244
Now I suggest you go home and you think about what you did.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.681
There's a review board meeting in the morning.

12:27.681 --> 12:30.210
You know I'm right, Dick.

12:30.210 --> 12:32.411
There's something big out there.

12:32.411 --> 12:35.034
Something really big.

12:43.944 --> 12:45.950
Maybe we should gather some samples.

12:45.950 --> 12:47.581
Pack it up.

12:47.581 --> 12:49.420
We have our answer.

12:56.738 --> 12:57.778
What's wrong?

12:57.778 --> 12:58.651
Nothing.

12:58.651 --> 13:00.674
I'm just allergic to men in suits.

13:00.674 --> 13:01.598
Yeah, I hear you.

13:01.598 --> 13:02.926
What happened out there?

13:02.926 --> 13:04.701
Nothing.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.635
Let's get a drink.

13:14.270 --> 13:17.592
You know he just burns me up. It's all about the Doria.

13:17.592 --> 13:18.691
All about the damages.

13:18.691 --> 13:21.466
Screw them. Those guys are all about the money.

13:21.466 --> 13:23.558
They can't see the big picture.

13:24.475 --> 13:25.627
Of course not.

13:25.627 --> 13:27.446
They're not mermaids like you.

13:27.446 --> 13:29.868
Yeah, well, this mermaid is getting canned.

13:29.868 --> 13:32.148
They're not going to decide anything tonight.

13:32.148 --> 13:36.605
No, they'll fire me in the morning, which doesn't give me a whole lot of time.

13:37.348 --> 13:39.371
For what?

13:39.371 --> 13:44.910
Now, that...that's the same look you gave me when we stole the sub.

13:44.910 --> 13:48.050
Borrowed. [clink]

14:04.880 --> 14:07.599
Oh, hey. I'm here to see the body.

14:09.991 --> 14:12.988
No one notified me of this.

14:12.988 --> 14:15.697
Yeah, tell me about it. I was home watching the game.

14:16.193 --> 14:20.349
We should get overtime for this late night shift, don't you think?

14:21.096 --> 14:23.291
I heard that.

14:24.702 --> 14:26.700
Thanks, hon.

14:28.650 --> 14:31.683
Better hurry with whatever you're doing in there.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.612
The boys are going to tow it out to open sea tonight.

14:35.612 --> 14:38.863
You know, before it explodes.

15:30.454 --> 15:34.624
Mr. Ori, I'm Dr. Shimada with the Oceanographic Institute.

15:34.624 --> 15:36.356
- I'm here to... - They're lying.

15:37.647 --> 15:39.447
- Who's lying? -  Everyone.

15:39.744 --> 15:42.300
They say it was a construction failure?

15:42.300 --> 15:45.805
I saw it on TV before they burst in and grabbed me.

15:45.805 --> 15:47.601
I know.

15:47.601 --> 15:50.079
And they're saying everyone was killed.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.288
Everyone.

15:51.288 --> 15:53.430
No survivors.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.632
Have they fucking say that when I'm sitting right here?

15:55.632 --> 15:56.630
Try to stay calm.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.128
Calm?

15:58.625 --> 16:02.925
My family thinks I'm dead and fucking even let me call them.

16:02.925 --> 16:06.615
Takeo, your family will soon be put at ease.

16:06.615 --> 16:08.820
But you must cooperate.

16:08.820 --> 16:12.513
These people can be very unpleasant when they don't get their way.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.460
Believe me, I know.

16:18.380 --> 16:20.839
You're not with these people.

16:20.839 --> 16:24.400
As I said, I'm a scientist.

16:24.400 --> 16:30.279
And the actual facts of what you experienced are something I'd very much like to discuss with you.

16:36.101 --> 16:38.583
I saw it.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.486
I looked into its eyes.

16:44.224 --> 16:47.467
What did it look like?

17:02.565 --> 17:05.670
Please. Show me.

17:26.550 --> 17:28.921
Put your tray up, sir.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.275
Put your seat back up, miss.

17:31.276 --> 17:35.063
Put your seat back up, sir.

17:39.290 --> 17:42.533
Ma'am, put your seat back up.

17:42.533 --> 17:44.481
Put your seat back up.

17:48.660 --> 17:51.355
Put your seat back, please.

17:54.947 --> 17:56.054
Whoa.

17:56.054 --> 17:57.950
Please sit down, sir. It's just an air pocket.

17:57.950 --> 17:58.687
Thank you.

17:58.687 --> 18:00.366
We're getting married in two days.

18:00.366 --> 18:01.094
You'll be fine.

18:01.094 --> 18:04.642
[Pilot] All right, folks, please fasten your seat belts.

18:08.594 --> 18:10.438
Holy Shit!

18:39.125 --> 18:40.049
Emma, wait.

18:40.049 --> 18:41.424
You're not my boss anymore, Dick.

18:41.424 --> 18:42.975
Emma, you're a good surveyist.

18:42.975 --> 18:44.807
You just need a little discipline, that's all.

18:44.807 --> 18:45.858
Want some advice?

18:45.858 --> 18:46.730
Nope.

18:47.149 --> 18:49.068
Don't love the ocean too much.

18:49.068 --> 18:51.685
It doesn't love you back.

19:55.925 --> 19:57.769
Professor Sanders?

19:57.769 --> 20:00.764
Ha ha! Emma! Emma MacNeil.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.636
As I live and breathe.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.049
How long has it been?

20:04.049 --> 20:06.580
- Like five years. - Five years?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.998
That's too long to be away from my favorite student.

20:08.998 --> 20:10.874
What's with this "Professor" jazz?

20:10.874 --> 20:14.078
You know, you once dragged my drunken arse out of the gutter

20:14.078 --> 20:16.473
And that puts us squarely in the familiar.

20:16.473 --> 20:18.465
God, it's just I'm kind of messed up right now.

20:18.466 --> 20:20.233
Well, tell me about it.

20:20.233 --> 20:22.839
Sounds like you need the luck of the Irish.

20:22.839 --> 20:25.399
Are you sure you're all right, lassie?

20:25.399 --> 20:27.396
I mean, you look a little tired.

20:27.396 --> 20:33.411
Well, I was just fired by the institute, Lamar, and I'm pretty sure I'm being followed.

20:33.411 --> 20:34.596
By whom?

20:34.596 --> 20:36.374
- The Feds. - Ah, the bloody Feds.

20:36.374 --> 20:39.362
They'll hound you till you're leaking from every orifice.

20:39.362 --> 20:43.678
Hey, don't worry, Emma. I won't let those bastards harm a hair on your head.

20:43.678 --> 20:47.033
I see you've brought the, uh, lab with you.

20:47.173 --> 20:48.713
Anything you want me to look at?

20:48.713 --> 20:50.986
Ha ha! Funny you should ask.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.922
You say you stole this from the site?

21:10.286 --> 21:12.845
Well, let's get to it, shall we?

22:02.495 --> 22:03.647
A tooth?

22:03.647 --> 22:05.598
Must have one hell of a smile.

22:05.598 --> 22:06.925
How big?

22:07.646 --> 22:08.978
About 11.

22:08.978 --> 22:10.805
Inches. Oh Juesus!

22:10.805 --> 22:11.822
Feet.

22:11.822 --> 22:13.199
Feet?

22:13.199 --> 22:15.876
Crazy. Who do you think it belongs to?

22:15.876 --> 22:19.627
Well, I don't know. You're the ex-Navy paleontologist guru.

22:19.627 --> 22:21.244
Yeah, well, that's true enough.

22:21.244 --> 22:24.129
Well, without making too much of a Hail Mary about it

22:24.129 --> 22:28.401
I'd say it belongs to one pretty old fella...prehistoric.

22:28.967 --> 22:31.294
A dinosaur? You've got to be kidding me.

22:31.294 --> 22:34.191
Why so doubtful? Look, didn't I always teach...

22:34.191 --> 22:36.974
Good to doubt, better to dig. I know. You're such a hippie.

22:36.974 --> 22:38.702
Yeah. And proud of it.

22:38.702 --> 22:40.791
Here. Say hello to megalodon.

22:43.804 --> 22:45.085
Meaning "big tooth."

22:45.085 --> 22:49.997
Lived 18 million years ago and was the apex predator of its time.

22:49.997 --> 22:54.395
- Became extinct... - 1.5 million years ago. Largest carnivorous fish ever known to have existed.

22:54.395 --> 22:59.402
And quite possibly the largest shark ever to have lived.

23:00.857 --> 23:04.773
Fossil evidence has revealed, by yours truly

23:04.773 --> 23:09.594
That megalodon fed upon large marine animals, including whales.

23:09.917 --> 23:15.437
Wait a minute. Are you trying to tell me that a prehistoric extinct shark ate my whale?

23:15.437 --> 23:17.227
Clearly not extinct.

23:17.227 --> 23:18.557
That's impossible.

23:18.557 --> 23:19.599
You sure about that?

23:19.600 --> 23:25.106
I can't turn on the TV without hearing about another unexplained ocean disaster.

23:25.106 --> 23:29.081
Yeah. Unexplained doesn't mean resurrected prehistoric sea monsters.

23:29.213 --> 23:34.173
Why? Sightings of giant sea monsters have persisted throughout the centuries.

23:34.173 --> 23:37.436
Hell, when I was driving subs for the man, I even saw one myself.

23:37.436 --> 23:38.645
You never told me that.

23:38.645 --> 23:41.659
Yeah, well, students are such a cynical bunch.

23:41.659 --> 23:46.073
I'd already been booted by the Fed. I couldn't risk being booted by the university.

23:46.073 --> 23:49.088
[phone rings] And besides, who would have believed me anyway?

23:49.843 --> 23:51.320
Yeah?

23:51.320 --> 23:56.581
Dr. Shimada. So nice to finally put a voice to the man.

24:16.998 --> 24:22.121
Dr. Shimada. Heard all about your wild diving bell experiments. Fantastic.

24:22.809 --> 24:27.754
I would consider running a ground a nuclear submarine to avoid hitting a dolphin

24:27.754 --> 24:30.176
a bit more on the wild side, Dr. Sanders.

24:30.176 --> 24:32.387
Actually, it was a pod of dolphins.

24:32.388 --> 24:36.159
So that's why you got kicked out of the Navy?

24:36.160 --> 24:40.560
May I present my former student, Emma MacNeil.

24:42.438 --> 24:45.657
A brilliant oceanographer and pilot in her own right.

24:45.657 --> 24:46.512
Doctor.

24:46.512 --> 24:47.718
Seiji.

24:47.718 --> 24:49.643
Pleased to meet you.

24:52.193 --> 24:54.291
Shall we?

24:54.791 --> 24:58.661
Well, imagine my surprise when I learned your government wanted my help.

24:58.661 --> 25:01.791
Well, Dr. Sanders, technically speaking... - Oh, please. Lamar.

25:01.791 --> 25:06.045
Well, Lamar, technically speaking, it is not my government requesting your help.

25:06.045 --> 25:07.050
It is me.

25:07.050 --> 25:08.576
All the more flattering.

25:08.576 --> 25:11.719
Diplomatically speaking, I am not here at all.

25:12.346 --> 25:16.885
Despite many news reports, no one is coming forward with the actual cause.

25:16.885 --> 25:21.542
This is largely due to the lack of any reliable physical evidence, Photographic or otherwise,

25:21.542 --> 25:24.521
And the fact that were any such data to come to light

25:24.521 --> 25:28.490
The government would almost certainly cover it up in an attempt to prevent global panic.

25:28.490 --> 25:32.446
Well, they're scared. They're totally unprepared for a disaster of this scale.

25:32.446 --> 25:36.870
And by the time they come to face the reality of the situation, it'll be too late.

25:36.870 --> 25:38.376
Which is precisely why I've come...

25:38.376 --> 25:42.712
To determine what exactly we're dealing with and what to do about it.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.710
It's not what I was expecting.

25:49.711 --> 25:52.100
Not from the character of the attacks.

25:52.101 --> 25:54.778
And what exactly is the nature of your attacks?

25:54.779 --> 25:59.970
The kind of damage we sustained is not compatible with the physiology of megalodon.

26:00.724 --> 26:04.782
I did manage to speak with one of the only survivors of our most recent attacks

26:04.782 --> 26:07.974
Before my government locked him away indefinitely.

26:09.104 --> 26:13.328
I like to consider these police identity sketches.

26:14.500 --> 26:19.062
Notice the eye. Enormous with a huge slit-shaped pupil.

26:19.290 --> 26:23.121
I agree. This is definitely not the eye of a shark.

26:23.309 --> 26:26.174
No, more like a... [doorbell rings]

26:26.174 --> 26:28.744
Excuse me....

26:43.670 --> 26:45.211
It's for you.

26:45.211 --> 26:47.292
Me? Who knows I'm here?

26:47.292 --> 26:49.518
No return address.

27:08.333 --> 27:12.167
This is the mini-sub camera. Vince must have dropped this off.

27:12.167 --> 27:13.356
Who?

27:13.356 --> 27:15.519
My friend Vince. He was there with me at the incident.

27:15.519 --> 27:17.223
What incident?

27:18.491 --> 27:19.682
[static]

27:25.655 --> 27:28.108
Oh, my God. I thought I imagined that.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.573
Definitely a shark.

27:31.573 --> 27:33.903
Megalodon.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.345
And his friend here.

27:39.792 --> 27:40.896
Same as the drawing.

27:40.896 --> 27:42.718
I suspect...

27:42.718 --> 27:44.419
What, giant squid?

27:44.419 --> 27:47.188
[both] Octopus.

28:04.311 --> 28:05.460
Fish and chip?

28:05.460 --> 28:06.900
I'm trying to go veg.

28:06.900 --> 28:10.766
Vince was smart to send you the videotape rather than go to the authorities.

28:10.766 --> 28:13.712
Yeah, well, he would have known I'd come to you. I talk about you often enough.

28:13.712 --> 28:16.374
Feel bad now for giving him such poor grades.

28:16.602 --> 28:21.503
One thing's for certain, we now have half the equation...photographic evidence.

28:21.503 --> 28:24.610
That's definitely an informed base from which to respond.

28:29.569 --> 28:30.684
Amazing.

28:30.684 --> 28:35.269
Two prehistoric creatures suddenly and mysteriously unleashed upon the world.

28:35.269 --> 28:37.276
Maybe not so mysteriously.

28:37.276 --> 28:39.987
The polar ice caps are melting because of our thoughtlessness.

28:39.987 --> 28:44.348
Maybe...Maybe this is our comeuppance.

29:11.807 --> 29:16.007
Top sound indicates 1-5-0 feet vertical clearance and lower.

29:16.007 --> 29:19.878
We're on the last leg of the sweep now, sir. Nothing as of yet.

29:19.878 --> 29:27.656
Give the president my personal assurance when we find the beast, we're sending him to hell.

29:36.382 --> 29:40.723
On deck! A thousand yards and closing!

29:43.918 --> 29:46.720
[alarm sounding] Battle stations! Battle stations!

29:48.662 --> 29:50.941
- All ahead, full. - All ahead, full. Aye.

29:50.941 --> 29:55.166
Execute Plan Delta. Repeat, execute Plan Delta.

29:56.614 --> 29:59.931
500 yards, still closing!

30:01.663 --> 30:05.402
- Intercept all locked. - Sir, our target is in the zone.

30:06.168 --> 30:11.502
Commence firing. Repeat, commence firing!

30:17.852 --> 30:21.607
Don't let up. Send that big bastard down for the deep six!

30:35.347 --> 30:36.899
Target's disappeared, sir.

30:36.899 --> 30:39.147
You mean destroyed. Target destroyed.

30:39.147 --> 30:42.784
- No, sir. I'm not getting anything at all. He's using a residual... - Radio Washington.

30:42.784 --> 30:44.081
Target destroyed.

30:44.081 --> 30:45.588
But, sir...

30:45.794 --> 30:48.929
[Man over radio] Target returned.

30:51.418 --> 30:53.549
It rises.

31:11.282 --> 31:12.537
[loud crash] No!

31:42.321 --> 31:45.461
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

31:46.944 --> 31:49.110
Seiji, coffee?

31:49.111 --> 31:50.201
Yes, please.

31:50.201 --> 31:51.212
- Sugar? - Yes.

31:51.212 --> 31:53.175
You got it.

31:54.252 --> 31:56.182
[loud crash] Hey! Whoa!

31:56.182 --> 31:57.939
Whoa, whoa.

31:58.100 --> 32:01.053
Mornin'. How can I assist you gentlemen?

32:17.838 --> 32:19.401
Cheer up, son.

32:19.401 --> 32:21.989
Not very feng shui, is it?

32:21.989 --> 32:24.229
Same lighting as Guantanamo, I believe.

32:24.229 --> 32:26.732
I feel very secure.

32:29.582 --> 32:34.658
Now don't look so worried, Dr. Shimada. You're not going to Manzanar.

32:34.658 --> 32:37.957
No, Manzanar was for Americans.

32:38.928 --> 32:43.070
Very good, Ms. MacNeil.

32:43.862 --> 32:48.467
I suppose you're wondering why we wrested you from your lovely slumber.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.613
Let me guess. Our country needs us.

32:51.613 --> 32:54.424
Kewpie doll for the Irishman.

32:54.424 --> 32:58.397
Actually, I was wondering what took you so long.

32:58.397 --> 33:03.264
Well, we like to exhaust all possibilities before calling up the minor leaguers.

33:04.542 --> 33:09.979
What, blood and thunder plan go in the dumper?

33:09.979 --> 33:17.169
Now, clearly, we're dealing with a menace that no one has ever imagined, much less counted on.

33:18.534 --> 33:20.679
Like Hurricane Katrina?

33:20.679 --> 33:24.567
Very good. And funny, Dr. Shimada.

33:24.567 --> 33:29.317
Do you realize your Japanese government has given us full authority over your destiny?

33:29.317 --> 33:32.749
Your very existence is in my hands.

33:32.903 --> 33:37.294
Unless, of course, you want to commit Harry Carry some shit.

33:37.294 --> 33:40.509
That is so wrong.

33:40.814 --> 33:45.096
And you, little lady, that's a lot of mouth coming from someone whose career is all washed up.

33:45.096 --> 33:48.016
Sleeping on your old prof's couch.

33:49.841 --> 33:52.884
What's next? A little extra credit to pay the rent?

33:52.884 --> 33:53.738
Hey!

33:53.738 --> 33:55.729
Cool it, hombre.

33:55.729 --> 34:00.709
You should be smiling. This country actually gives shit about what you have to say.

34:00.962 --> 34:05.908
20 years ago, my ideas were treated with disdain and discharge.

34:05.908 --> 34:08.175
Why should you give that shit now?

34:09.520 --> 34:14.862
Well, truth be told, you losers beat everyone to the punch.

34:14.862 --> 34:16.733
You said shark...

34:16.733 --> 34:22.109
When everyone around here was talking seismic suction or some shit.

34:23.246 --> 34:25.353
So, uh, what do you want from us?

34:25.353 --> 34:27.005
Solutions.

34:27.277 --> 34:31.927
Now, if we don't find Bible means stopping this fucker sharkzilla is gonna own the seas.

34:31.927 --> 34:36.966
You own the seas, you own the world. Why I'm expect got that run.

34:37.335 --> 34:38.775
What?

34:38.992 --> 34:41.164
I'm an equal opportunity racist.

34:41.164 --> 34:46.094
Now, these red zones indicate strikes on military vessels.

34:50.496 --> 34:54.978
These indicate strikes on civilian, private vessels.

34:58.673 --> 35:01.786
I'll give you a tip for nothing. Megalodon don't discriminate.

35:01.786 --> 35:04.804
Yes, he's an equal opportunity eating machine.

35:04.804 --> 35:06.692
And he ain't alone.

35:17.756 --> 35:20.656
Whoa! What the... - Octopus. Frozen together.

35:20.656 --> 35:22.208
Now acting independently.

35:22.208 --> 35:26.591
Unless you're thinking that shark, he was teleporting from one side of the globe to the other,

35:26.591 --> 35:30.451
I think you'll find it fits your disaster timeline.

35:30.451 --> 35:32.697
A giant octopus? That's crazy.

35:33.268 --> 35:35.656
We've been discussing possible means of containment.

35:35.656 --> 35:37.321
You mean destruction.

35:37.321 --> 35:39.127
No, we mean containment.

35:39.127 --> 35:43.728
Yes, these creatures are a threat, but they also represent the most significant scientific discovery of our time.

35:43.728 --> 35:45.726
You can't just annihilate that.

35:47.835 --> 35:52.474
Now, we want your assurance that you will do everything within your power to entrap these creatures.

35:52.923 --> 35:55.339
You do, do you?

35:55.339 --> 35:56.429
And in return?

35:56.429 --> 35:58.785
You'll have our full support.

35:58.785 --> 36:01.173
Indeed. Professor Sanders and I both agree

36:01.173 --> 36:07.050
isolating these creatures in low shelf areas would enable us to possibly capture and contain them.

36:09.159 --> 36:11.175
May I?

36:22.086 --> 36:26.379
San Francisco Bay and Tokyo Bay represent the best options for this scenario.

36:26.379 --> 36:28.838
Think of it as a corral.

36:28.838 --> 36:33.166
And how do you propose we get these things to their ideal locations? Send 'em an Evite?

36:33.654 --> 36:35.328
We're working on it.

36:35.328 --> 36:36.997
Well, work fast.

36:37.770 --> 36:42.883
Naval intelligence indicates these things are on a continual warpath.

36:42.883 --> 36:45.499
They don't rest. They just kill.

36:45.499 --> 36:51.047
Head-to-head combat is futile, so figure out this lure thing, pronto.

37:05.187 --> 37:07.125
Have a look.

38:26.012 --> 38:26.773
Thanks.

38:26.773 --> 38:28.634
Sure.

38:28.634 --> 38:31.681
How are you holding up?

38:31.763 --> 38:34.819
It's not easy being brilliant under armed guard.

38:34.820 --> 38:37.462
From what I know, you're no stranger to pressure.

38:37.463 --> 38:42.221
Joyriding an experimental sub in an ice floe seems kind of intense.

38:44.613 --> 38:47.819
Yeah, well, I was always drawn to the water.

38:47.819 --> 38:49.452
Always felt like a part of it.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.606
Me, too.

38:53.530 --> 38:57.945
It didn't matter how rough or stormy or how big the waves were.

38:57.945 --> 39:00.070
It never scared me.

39:00.070 --> 39:02.406
Me, too.

39:03.354 --> 39:07.119
My family were all fishermen.

39:07.119 --> 39:12.718
Lived on the water. Lived because of the water.

39:14.127 --> 39:17.590
They all wanted me to follow in their footsteps.

39:19.105 --> 39:20.944
Why didn't you?

39:20.944 --> 39:23.609
Too much death.

39:23.997 --> 39:27.694
I saw a dolphin caught in a net when I was a kid.

39:27.694 --> 39:30.267
I couldn't free it.

39:31.865 --> 39:36.511
Panic in its eyes, the helplessness.

39:36.924 --> 39:38.945
That was it.

39:38.946 --> 39:42.866
I never got past putting the worm on the hook.

40:07.265 --> 40:11.114
I'm gonna go take a walk.

40:12.305 --> 40:17.865
You know, a...a walk.

40:48.609 --> 40:50.588
You smell so good.

40:50.588 --> 40:53.213
Mmm. So do you.

40:54.433 --> 40:57.069
[sniffs] Smell is a powerful thing.

40:57.069 --> 41:01.387
Scent-based cues help us zero in on optimal partners.

41:01.387 --> 41:07.208
Smell may even explain why we feel chemistry with one person and not another.

41:07.208 --> 41:09.943
[laughs] You say the most romantic things.

41:09.943 --> 41:11.551
Seriously.

41:11.869 --> 41:17.252
They say physical attraction itself may literally be based...on smell.

41:19.324 --> 41:20.765
What?

41:20.766 --> 41:23.254
Pheromones.

41:23.254 --> 41:26.375
- My God. Are you thinng tha... - Pheromones. The attraction.

41:26.375 --> 41:28.652
We can use it to draw them in.

41:28.652 --> 41:29.836
Yes!

41:50.264 --> 41:52.557
Emma, it's brilliant!

41:52.557 --> 41:55.081
I...I...I have to agree.

41:55.081 --> 41:57.086
I taught her everything she knows.

41:57.086 --> 42:00.894
Before we order the cake and the balloons, does somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on?

42:00.894 --> 42:03.132
Scent. The biological power of the scent.

42:03.132 --> 42:05.702
You know pheromones? The attraction that connects all species.

42:05.702 --> 42:08.155
It's the source of all procreation. The ultimate magnet.

42:08.155 --> 42:12.527
Basically, we bait San Francisco and Tokyo bays with the respected pheromones for each beast.

42:12.527 --> 42:18.875
The shark and the octopus detect the scent and are drawn in, thinking there's a mate awaiting them.

42:18.875 --> 42:20.529
Tragic, actually.

42:20.529 --> 42:22.976
How can we be so sure that they're gonna take the bait?

42:22.976 --> 42:26.412
Those guys have been frozen in ice for millions of years.

42:26.412 --> 42:28.911
Wouldn't you be a little horny?

42:37.291 --> 42:39.656
Think of it like dropping breadcrumbs.

42:39.656 --> 42:43.492
We plant a series of these out at sea, luring our friend right into the San Francisco Bay.

42:43.492 --> 42:47.016
We can use UAV technology to strategically place that bait.

42:47.016 --> 42:48.847
Plot a path that leads it right to the trap.

42:48.847 --> 42:51.767
And what, may I ask, is your trap exactly?

42:51.767 --> 42:52.552
Oh, you can ask.

42:52.552 --> 42:55.005
What about the people of San Francisco? Can they ask?

42:55.005 --> 42:57.019
What they don't know...

42:59.459 --> 43:02.885
If you need help baiting the hook, give us a holler.

43:02.885 --> 43:03.888
I will.

43:03.888 --> 43:07.859
Lucky for us, my government magically produced the necessary octopus flesh samples.

43:07.859 --> 43:10.864
They've been hiding it like it was the Ark of the Covenant.

43:10.864 --> 43:13.353
At least they didn't destroy it.

43:14.283 --> 43:17.213
I feel like we just started getting to know one another.

43:17.213 --> 43:21.452
I know. In all this darkness, you were the one ray of light.

43:21.452 --> 43:25.999
- I just hope that... - If it's fated, we'll see each other again.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.404
You sure you're gonna be all right?

43:39.404 --> 43:40.450
Of course.

43:40.450 --> 43:44.352
Always best to do battle on...how do you Americans say it? One's own turf.

43:44.353 --> 43:46.592
Yeah.

43:47.670 --> 43:50.377
I'll ring you from Tokyo.

43:50.377 --> 43:51.465
Good luck.

43:51.465 --> 43:53.160
Sayonara.

43:55.608 --> 43:58.159
Come on, Juliet, back to work.

44:03.071 --> 44:07.755
Spock 7, this is Tango Delta Niner. I spotted something.

44:09.009 --> 44:12.256
1-7, this is Tango Delta Niner. We spotted something.

44:12.256 --> 44:14.243
This could be it, people.

44:17.094 --> 44:18.604
Shark or squid?

44:18.604 --> 44:19.301
Octopus.

44:19.301 --> 44:20.243
Hard to say.

44:20.243 --> 44:22.799
They are both roughly the same size.

44:24.223 --> 44:26.504
But the image is fading.

44:26.504 --> 44:29.745
Tango Delta, reduce altitude immediately.

44:31.047 --> 44:33.232
Sir, we're flying at break-point altitude.

44:33.232 --> 44:35.708
Any lower could endanger the mission.

44:35.708 --> 44:37.670
Endanger the mission? You mean endanger yourself.

44:37.670 --> 44:41.515
But, sir... - Get down there and get a proper bead on that beast or I'll have your wings, Colonel.

44:41.515 --> 44:43.281
Roger that.

44:47.587 --> 44:49.657
Wait. Going any lower would...

44:49.657 --> 44:52.368
Would have him do the job that he's been paid to do.

44:52.368 --> 44:54.504
About time these fly boys earned their keep.

44:54.504 --> 44:57.557
Blackbird descending to elevation 6-5-0.

44:57.557 --> 44:59.298
Copy that.

45:01.712 --> 45:04.055
Ha. See?

45:08.160 --> 45:11.448
How low is that plane flying?

45:11.448 --> 45:14.270
About a hundred feet off the deck. Close enough to get pictures.

45:14.270 --> 45:15.297
- Pull up! - What?

45:15.297 --> 45:17.960
Get him to pull up now!

45:20.531 --> 45:23.263
Mayday, mayday! Sir, I'm going down!

45:23.263 --> 45:25.152
Lock in his last position.

45:25.152 --> 45:26.527
No!

45:29.214 --> 45:30.539
[alarm sounding]

45:31.571 --> 45:33.376
Prepare a fire series.

45:38.890 --> 45:40.654
Fire!

45:40.654 --> 45:43.159
- Firing! - Missiles away!

45:52.172 --> 45:53.570
Target gone, sir.

45:53.570 --> 45:55.454
Yeah, along with the plane.

46:02.265 --> 46:05.426
Now that we've set the bait, how long before these things get a whiff?

46:05.426 --> 46:10.802
On his current course and speed, I'd say he hits the first one in about five hours.

46:10.802 --> 46:12.501
Hmm, and home plate?

46:12.501 --> 46:14.113
We'll place our hero lure here.

46:16.216 --> 46:18.317
The farthest point from civilian activity.

46:18.317 --> 46:22.027
The shelf forms a natural recess, kind of like a large overhang in a cave.

46:22.027 --> 46:25.746
You back that thing up against that wall, he'll have nowhere to go.

46:25.746 --> 46:27.140
And what about delivery?

46:27.140 --> 46:31.138
We place it ourselves. I don't want these SEAL guys gumming this up.

46:31.138 --> 46:33.801
Now you're putting me between a rock and a hard place here.

46:33.801 --> 46:37.172
Last time he had the stick, he ran it up into a sandbar.

46:37.172 --> 46:39.822
$50 million moving violation.

46:39.822 --> 46:43.863
At least, uh, you salvaged yours.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.535
I'll get us in.

47:06.067 --> 47:08.647
I just heard from Seiji.

47:08.647 --> 47:14.085
The octopus is headed towards Tokyo, and our shark is on its way here.

47:15.885 --> 47:17.041
You all right?

47:17.041 --> 47:19.134
Yeah. You?

47:22.275 --> 47:26.445
We have to be very careful out there, lassie.

47:26.445 --> 47:27.634
I know.

47:27.634 --> 47:30.040
We're going into their world now.

47:30.040 --> 47:33.275
Their pond. They've got the advantage.

47:33.674 --> 47:38.427
It's strange, I've always seen myself as an observer of nature, a scientist.

47:38.427 --> 47:40.422
Not a soldier.

47:40.422 --> 47:43.640
Well, in a perfect world, that would be the case.

47:44.112 --> 47:51.150
But every scientist faces something like this sooner or later when to interfere for the greater good.

47:51.150 --> 47:56.636
I keep thinking about Einstein and Oppenheimer. The magnitude of it.

47:57.516 --> 47:59.015
The destruction.

47:59.015 --> 48:01.599
This is a big one, all right.

48:01.599 --> 48:08.770
But make no mistake, Emma, what we do here, it's necessary and right.

48:12.828 --> 48:15.648
I'm just so glad you could be here with me, Lamar.

48:15.648 --> 48:19.080
I don't know how I could have done it without you.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.531
Sure you would.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.677
I'm proud of you, Emma.

48:22.677 --> 48:25.392
I've always been proud of you.

48:26.559 --> 48:30.918
But never more than at this moment.

49:04.826 --> 49:06.927
[sonar pings]

49:26.457 --> 49:28.471
[Man over radio]Pod attached.

49:28.471 --> 49:29.734
Copy that.

49:29.734 --> 49:32.859
Prepare to untether. On my mark.

49:32.859 --> 49:36.005
3. 2. 1

49:36.005 --> 49:38.063
Disengage tether.

49:43.264 --> 49:46.576
Nice and smooth.

50:01.021 --> 50:05.220
So how's it feel to be back behind the wheel?

50:06.078 --> 50:07.236
Jitters?

50:07.773 --> 50:10.270
We could be going up against megalodon.

50:10.270 --> 50:12.071
Jitters?

50:12.812 --> 50:15.318
I freakin' love it.

50:29.297 --> 50:34.349
[sonar pinging] Shelf in 100 meters.

50:34.349 --> 50:35.728
Right.

50:35.728 --> 50:37.920
I'll get on the arm.

50:42.930 --> 50:45.710
50 meters.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.610
Got it.

50:51.039 --> 50:53.144
In position.

50:57.129 --> 50:59.400
Copy.

51:05.679 --> 51:08.717
Inch up a hair starboard.

51:08.717 --> 51:10.299
Copy.

51:11.919 --> 51:14.601
Steady now.

51:17.399 --> 51:19.819
Standby to release.

51:19.819 --> 51:22.162
Standing by.

51:23.539 --> 51:25.564
Okay.

51:25.564 --> 51:27.358
Let her go.

51:29.739 --> 51:31.779
I said let her go.

51:32.346 --> 51:35.071
Yeah, I know. I heard you.

51:36.038 --> 51:38.746
What are you doing?

51:38.746 --> 51:40.465
It's jammed.

51:40.465 --> 51:43.428
You two love birds wanna quit jerking off and drop that thing?

51:43.428 --> 51:45.960
Haven't you been listening, genius? The arm's frozen.

51:46.203 --> 51:47.532
- Sir? - What?

51:47.532 --> 51:52.604
Target on warpath, sir. Past the first two lures and following projected course.

51:53.719 --> 51:55.761
How long before it reaches the bay?

51:55.762 --> 51:58.468
Its speed is greatly accelerated, sir. Almost tripled.

51:58.468 --> 51:59.733
All right, listen, you two.

51:59.733 --> 52:02.459
Sharkzilla's gonna be in your lap in about five minutes.

52:02.459 --> 52:05.235
So figure out a way to drop that thing or abandon ship.

52:05.462 --> 52:09.460
The ship's got no anchor. We abandon ship, it could drift right into Fisherman's Wharf.

52:09.460 --> 52:14.594
Or out into the middle of the bay. Now, if you want to entomb him, it's got to be here.

52:14.594 --> 52:17.530
Well, figure it out! We're running out of time.

52:18.282 --> 52:21.058
Always dug bumper cars.

52:22.411 --> 52:26.468
Whoa! Easy, Emma. You're gonna smack the thing.

52:26.468 --> 52:28.838
The thing's chrome steel.

52:31.312 --> 52:34.288
[crash] [sonar pinging] Uh-oh.

52:36.636 --> 52:39.305
Target speed accelerated to 500 knots, sir.

52:39.305 --> 52:41.226
Christ, this comming faster than a jet.

52:41.226 --> 52:43.301
Christ, do you think you can make it?

52:43.301 --> 52:45.802
I'm trying! We're stuck!

52:47.410 --> 52:50.185
ETA, two minutes.

52:50.185 --> 52:53.810
Admiral Scott, ETA, two minutes. Time to corral the horses.

52:56.317 --> 52:57.693
Move 'em in position.

52:57.693 --> 52:59.113
Aye, aye, sir.

52:59.113 --> 53:02.067
Nemo. I repeat, Nemo.

53:03.331 --> 53:09.611
Listen, screw these environmentalists. When I give the command, shoot to kill.

53:11.214 --> 53:13.679
[crashing, rumbling] We lost the arm!

53:13.679 --> 53:15.636
Who cares? Floor it!

53:25.004 --> 53:26.249
Target inside the perimeter.

53:26.249 --> 53:27.862
Inside the ring, sir.

53:27.862 --> 53:29.844
Wait for the command.

53:31.176 --> 53:34.028
Wait for the command.

53:34.029 --> 53:37.147
Wait for the command.

53:45.704 --> 53:47.849
- Hey! Are you Okay?- Yeah

53:50.197 --> 53:52.545
- [shouting] Fire! - Commence firing!

53:52.545 --> 53:56.263
Commence firing. Repeat, commence firing.

53:57.664 --> 54:02.108
[explosions]

54:29.276 --> 54:30.485
Report! Report!

54:30.485 --> 54:31.837
Too much debris, sir.

54:31.837 --> 54:33.711
Impossible to see, sir.

54:33.711 --> 54:35.193
Hit him again.

54:36.705 --> 54:38.691
Anything?

54:40.939 --> 54:44.648
Still no reading on the target, sir.

54:45.233 --> 54:48.086
Target destroyed.

54:48.086 --> 54:52.229
Target destroyed. Repeat, target destroyed.

54:52.229 --> 54:54.263
Whoo! Who wants sharkskin boots?

54:57.325 --> 55:00.682
Sir, I'm picking up a reading.

55:06.257 --> 55:09.783
[alarm sounding] Evasive action, sir.

55:13.805 --> 55:16.752
Evasive action, sir!

55:16.752 --> 55:18.180
Sir!

55:22.297 --> 55:25.184
- Christ, Oh. - Hold on!

55:30.339 --> 55:34.745
Open the port right port! C'mon MacNeil, Open the port!

55:35.882 --> 55:39.214
Sir, target is heading for the Golden Gate Bridge.

55:39.214 --> 55:41.230
Sir?

56:15.816 --> 56:18.487
Target lost, sir.

56:18.487 --> 56:21.143
Off all scopes.

56:22.832 --> 56:25.499
Get me Shimada in Tokyo.

56:33.203 --> 56:37.864
I sincerely hope you've had more success in San Francisco than we've had here in Tokyo.

56:37.864 --> 56:40.539
Shimada, what's happening?

56:40.539 --> 56:43.963
As you can see, we effectively lured the octopus into the bay.

56:43.963 --> 56:47.089
But our military has only succeeded in angering it.

56:47.089 --> 56:50.053
Like a cornered dog, it's even more vicious than ever.

56:51.652 --> 56:54.183
Madness.

56:54.183 --> 56:56.042
Target changing course, sir.

56:56.042 --> 57:00.367
Wait a minute. It appears the beast is now on the run.

57:03.489 --> 57:06.365
My God, what have we done?

57:09.468 --> 57:13.750
Tell me, what success have you had with the shark?

57:13.750 --> 57:15.979
Very little, I'm afraid.

57:16.825 --> 57:21.204
Sir, the octopus is gone from the scopes.

57:21.204 --> 57:23.972
Then we have much more to do.

57:23.972 --> 57:26.298
Are Ms. MacNeil and Professor Sanders all right?

57:26.298 --> 57:27.325
Yeah, we're all right.

57:27.325 --> 57:28.789
Yeah, but the city's in shambles.

57:28.789 --> 57:30.922
Thousand of people are dead. What the fuck was happen!

57:30.922 --> 57:32.593
Hey, stand down or you're going to the brig.

57:32.593 --> 57:34.598
She's going nowhere, and you know it.

57:34.598 --> 57:36.957
She's the only thing about this op that worked.

57:36.957 --> 57:39.177
Seiji, what happened?

57:39.177 --> 57:40.537
We had some trouble.

57:40.537 --> 57:43.271
The bait relay worked, just like you said, Emma.

57:43.271 --> 57:45.766
- But once he entered the bay... - They flopped.

57:45.766 --> 57:50.998
The octopus sustained multiple hits from both artillery and missiles to little effect.

57:50.998 --> 57:54.367
Same here. It appears our weapons have very little effect.

57:54.367 --> 57:55.771
Conventional weapons.

57:55.771 --> 57:57.420
So what are you suggesting?

57:57.420 --> 58:00.824
Perhaps it's time to consider something more all-encompassing.

58:00.824 --> 58:01.595
What, nuke?

58:01.595 --> 58:02.459
Yeah.

58:02.459 --> 58:03.885
I don't believe I'm hearing this.

58:03.885 --> 58:04.991
Nor I.

58:04.991 --> 58:07.895
I do. It's the military default setting.

58:07.895 --> 58:11.831
Hey, civilian casualties have already skyrocketed on both sides of the world.

58:11.831 --> 58:13.141
What, and you want to add to that?

58:13.141 --> 58:16.936
Nuclear weapons may be our only viable option.

58:18.143 --> 58:23.575
And that's what I'm recommending to Washington before we have a global catastrophe on our hands.

58:24.270 --> 58:25.427
Do you really think he'd do this?

58:25.427 --> 58:28.465
He's on the phone to the Pentagon right now.

58:28.465 --> 58:30.681
This cannot be allowed to happen.

58:30.681 --> 58:33.953
The effects of multiple underwater nuclear explosions would be catastrophic,

58:33.953 --> 58:39.651
The devastation of marine life unimaginable, and miles of oceans would be poisoned with fallout.

58:39.651 --> 58:44.837
Also, the potential for coastal damage and human casualties is extremely high.

58:44.837 --> 58:46.882
Plus massive tidal waves.

58:46.882 --> 58:49.247
Then we'd better think of something else fast.

58:49.573 --> 58:52.581
I suggest we all get some rest and reconvene.

58:52.581 --> 58:55.794
Nothing can be accomplished in a state of exhaustion.

59:23.123 --> 59:25.020
[voice echoing] Catastrophic...

59:25.020 --> 59:28.224
devastation... unimaginable.

59:48.816 --> 59:50.286
Jesus, What!

59:50.286 --> 59:52.407
Thrilla in Manila.

59:52.889 --> 59:54.570
Come again?

59:54.570 --> 59:57.467
We'll get them to kill each other.

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:01.636
I don't like it.

01:00:01.636 --> 01:00:03.876
Look, the same battle they were frozen in millions of years ago

01:00:03.876 --> 01:00:06.022
will be the battle that finishes them off. It's simple.

01:00:06.022 --> 01:00:07.851
Brilliant, Emma.

01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:11.044
Wait a second. Can I interrupt this lovefest for a minute?

01:00:11.044 --> 01:00:13.682
How do you propose we get these two things together?

01:00:13.682 --> 01:00:17.433
We implement the same pheromone lure procedure we used earlier.

01:00:17.433 --> 01:00:20.696
It was the only aspect that worked perfectly.

01:00:20.696 --> 01:00:23.350
Okay, say they do come together.

01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:25.507
What's going to guarantee they're going to duke it out?

01:00:25.507 --> 01:00:27.000
To the death, no less?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.863
It's in their nature. They're natural-born enemies.

01:00:32.092 --> 01:00:35.138
The fact that they were frozen in mid-combat makes that clear.

01:00:35.138 --> 01:00:37.557
Look, as the Ice Age descended, animals panicked.

01:00:37.557 --> 01:00:40.004
They ran for their lives, but not these guys.

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:43.505
These guys chose to stay and fight to the end.

01:00:44.929 --> 01:00:50.102
Only a hate stronger than their combined survival instincts could force such a result.

01:00:51.042 --> 01:00:53.556
That hate is our last chance.

01:00:53.556 --> 01:00:55.884
Indeed. The laws of physics apply.

01:00:55.884 --> 01:00:59.423
Each possesses a strength that dwarfs our own military might.

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:04.842
But turn their respective destructive powers against one another, and wham!

01:01:04.842 --> 01:01:06.034
They cancel each other out.

01:01:06.034 --> 01:01:09.398
Yeah, but we got one small problem.

01:01:10.718 --> 01:01:13.158
What do we see up there?

01:01:14.677 --> 01:01:16.166
Anybody?

01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:17.100
Nothing.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.892
Score one for Miss Fancy Pants.

01:01:18.892 --> 01:01:21.316
They're running silent, and they're running deep.

01:01:21.316 --> 01:01:24.068
The SR-71 spy planes are picking up zilch.

01:01:24.068 --> 01:01:26.209
And even if we do get a blip on the screen

01:01:26.209 --> 01:01:28.441
They move so fast, we can't get a fix on them.

01:01:28.441 --> 01:01:29.385
They're adapting.

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:33.123
And restless. All marine life accelerates under duress.

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:36.533
A school of fish will move three times normal speed when agitated.

01:01:36.533 --> 01:01:37.887
Yeah, we're pissing them off.

01:01:37.887 --> 01:01:41.210
Yeah, well, they're pissing me off, along with all the leaders of the Free World.

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:44.941
They've got complete run of the ocean now...just what we wanted to avoid.

01:01:44.941 --> 01:01:47.533
All shipping is at a standstill. Oil can't move.

01:01:47.533 --> 01:01:51.496
There's only one course of action...put to sea and narrow them out.

01:01:51.496 --> 01:01:53.845
Shove the bait right under their noses.

01:01:53.845 --> 01:01:55.848
They'll pick up where they left off.

01:01:55.848 --> 01:01:59.146
All we need to do is get them in the ring.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.160
What ring?

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.645
Somewhere far from civilization.

01:02:03.645 --> 01:02:06.361
Somewhere where all they can do is harm each other.

01:02:06.361 --> 01:02:10.208
I assume you have submarines patrolling out there now.

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:14.886
Yeah. All Wolf Packs on high alert. The Japs are doing the same thing.

01:02:15.784 --> 01:02:21.690
Then get us in a tin can with our pheromone lures and get us out there.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.401
The effectiveness of the lure has much to do with the dispersement pattern, Captain.

01:02:36.401 --> 01:02:39.441
It is essential that the system pulse every 15 minutes.

01:02:39.441 --> 01:02:40.526
Understood.

01:02:40.526 --> 01:02:44.165
Pheromone dispersement is up and running as of 0900.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.463
Thank you, Captain.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:01.185
Oh, you look a little green. Need to go to sick bay?

01:03:01.185 --> 01:03:05.023
Nah. No, the, uh...the Dramamine's going to kick in soon.

01:03:07.148 --> 01:03:10.317
There's more bells and whistles on that circuit now.

01:03:10.317 --> 01:03:14.683
- You used to drive? - Way back. Washington class. Polaris missile.

01:03:14.683 --> 01:03:16.756
Wow. Old school.

01:03:16.756 --> 01:03:19.739
Dr. Sanders, pheromone release is working 5-by-5.

01:03:19.739 --> 01:03:20.674
Thanks.

01:03:20.674 --> 01:03:23.231
Now, I have some questions regarding our current course heading.

01:03:23.231 --> 01:03:24.536
Why?

01:03:25.028 --> 01:03:28.952
Because, Miss MacNeil, the farther north we go, the rougher the sea.

01:03:28.952 --> 01:03:31.868
[chuckles] Not scared of a little rough water, are we, Captain?

01:03:32.831 --> 01:03:37.573
You'll have to excuse my former student. She likes to spend her free time drowning.

01:03:37.913 --> 01:03:39.876
The last position on the shark was due north.

01:03:39.876 --> 01:03:41.806
And how do you know it'll hold its course?

01:03:41.806 --> 01:03:43.604
I don't. I just have a feeling.

01:03:43.604 --> 01:03:47.298
Well, it must be nice, being so imprecise in one's own work.

01:03:47.298 --> 01:03:50.570
Actually that bucks shit out of me. But you start with what you know.

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:54.240
An instinct followed by a trial followed by some sort of resolution.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.604
Hopefully.

01:03:55.604 --> 01:03:58.285
What kind of resolution are we hoping for?

01:03:58.712 --> 01:04:01.205
A blood bath.

01:04:04.314 --> 01:04:06.027
All ahead, full.

01:04:11.058 --> 01:04:13.529
Everything appears to be working as planned.

01:04:13.529 --> 01:04:15.963
We continue to follow a northernly heading.

01:04:15.963 --> 01:04:20.221
From the data you sent, it appears our friends have a longing for cooler climates.

01:04:20.653 --> 01:04:23.229
Well, it sure looks that way.

01:04:23.229 --> 01:04:27.541
Unusual, though. Neither has followed any kind of consistent pattern.

01:04:27.877 --> 01:04:30.695
Yeah, but somehow it makes sense.

01:04:30.695 --> 01:04:32.343
What do you mean?

01:04:32.343 --> 01:04:34.741
They seem programmed to intersect.

01:04:35.688 --> 01:04:41.912
The intersection of individual paths, random or calculated, is what creates and destroys.

01:04:42.642 --> 01:04:46.495
The universe itself was born of such intersection.

01:04:46.495 --> 01:04:49.713
And the events of our daily lives are formed by same.

01:04:50.256 --> 01:04:52.721
Or destroyed by the same.

01:04:53.566 --> 01:04:55.481
True.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:05:02.688
Still, whatever our future holds, I'm very glad our immediate paths have crossed.

01:05:03.054 --> 01:05:06.705
Indeed. It's been a pleasure.

01:05:07.181 --> 01:05:09.604
There are some words from Julius Caesar.

01:05:09.604 --> 01:05:15.730
If we knew this day's end where it come, but suffice that it will end.

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:18.177
And then the end will be known.

01:05:18.177 --> 01:05:23.026
But if we meet again, why, we shall smile.

01:05:23.026 --> 01:05:28.039
- But if not... - Then this parting was well made.

01:05:37.045 --> 01:05:41.506
I gotta confer with the navigator.

01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:49.111
I think a lot about that night.

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:51.124
Me, too.

01:05:51.124 --> 01:05:53.606
Any time I go to sweep up.

01:05:57.593 --> 01:05:59.112
I'll talk to you soon.

01:05:59.112 --> 01:06:01.022
Okay.

01:06:01.022 --> 01:06:03.305
[Man on intercom] Everyone to the bridge!

01:06:06.621 --> 01:06:10.042
- [Men shouting in foreign language] Put it on speaker.- Aye.

01:06:10.042 --> 01:06:11.417
What is it? What's going on?

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:12.645
Sounds like Russian.

01:06:12.645 --> 01:06:14.766
No, it's a distress call. They're under attack.

01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:17.365
Who's under attack? I thought all shipping lines were closed.

01:06:17.365 --> 01:06:23.367
Captain, I'm getting confirmation on the hijacking of a Petrox oil tanker off the Finnish coast three days ago.

01:06:23.367 --> 01:06:26.449
Petrox refused to pay the ransom, so they killed the crew.

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:29.995
[repeats in Russian:Moschoi Monster] They're screaming "sea monster."

01:06:29.995 --> 01:06:33.071
Yeah, well, it sounds like the creature's policed them up, all right.

01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:36.350
Captain, I suggest you call an intercept course immediately.

01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:39.996
Now, if we're lucky, he'll rest after his meal, and we can get ahead of him.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.587
Let him get a whiff, maybe you can get him to chase us.

01:06:42.587 --> 01:06:43.706
Chase?

01:06:43.896 --> 01:06:47.755
Fix on that transmission. Plot us a course, first sub.

01:06:55.129 --> 01:06:58.388
[Man] Jack stud cruise Ready battle stations.

01:06:58.388 --> 01:07:00.084
[Emma] Fire it?

01:07:00.084 --> 01:07:01.902
Cooked well done.

01:07:05.806 --> 01:07:07.740
Which creature did that?

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:11.089
Impossible to tell from the damage. Are we still floating that lure?

01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:13.268
Every 15 minutes, just like you ordered.

01:07:13.268 --> 01:07:14.298
Good.

01:07:14.298 --> 01:07:15.861
Now, if he shows up...

01:07:15.861 --> 01:07:19.080
We floor it. Maybe he split.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.481
Maybe.

01:07:23.535 --> 01:07:26.309
[crash] [Man] Shark! Shark!

01:07:28.101 --> 01:07:29.444
What the hell's going on?

01:07:29.444 --> 01:07:31.226
Strap yourselves down.

01:07:32.433 --> 01:07:34.356
He's right on top of us, Captain.

01:07:34.356 --> 01:07:36.254
All ahead, full.

01:07:36.254 --> 01:07:37.793
Aye, Captain. All ahead, full.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:50.753
Radio attack. Tell them to lock and load.

01:07:50.753 --> 01:07:53.707
We're heading for them with the devil on our tail!

01:07:54.582 --> 01:07:58.579
Jesus. How do you live on in it?

01:08:01.816 --> 01:08:03.886
Looks cute when you are frightened

01:08:03.886 --> 01:08:06.282
Ready stern to 1 and 2

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:08.732
Ready stern 1 and 2, Aye.

01:08:09.136 --> 01:08:10.936
Prepare to fire!

01:08:14.311 --> 01:08:16.404
Fire 1

01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:19.711
Fire 2

01:08:19.926 --> 01:08:22.231
Away

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:24.680
Torepedos on course

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:29.872
Impacted in 5. 4. 3. 2.

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:35.805
Torpedos' missed!

01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:38.462
Sweet Jesus!

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:44.183
He's gaining on us, sir.

01:08:51.221 --> 01:08:53.955
[Man on radio] Wolf Pack Fleet reporting for duty.

01:08:53.955 --> 01:08:56.915
Nice shooting, boys, but you're late.

01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:59.019
Sorry, boss. We'll let you in the front door.

01:08:59.019 --> 01:09:01.613
This is unacceptable. I want that commander on report.

01:09:01.613 --> 01:09:03.778
That commander saved your ass.

01:09:04.036 --> 01:09:06.997
Should've done so in a more timely manner.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:10.397
Send another volley, will you? Let's keep it at bay.

01:09:10.397 --> 01:09:12.913
I thought you wanted the bastards to follow us.

01:09:12.913 --> 01:09:15.841
I do, but I don't want them to be that close.

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:20.831
Aye, aye, sir.

01:09:30.673 --> 01:09:31.810
Sonar, report.

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:33.073
Pack is down, Captain.

01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:34.622
What do you mean, the pack's down?

01:09:34.622 --> 01:09:36.599
All five ships.

01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:41.932
[pinging] Destroyed by octopus.

01:09:43.604 --> 01:09:46.115
- Octopus? Where did he come from? - All right. Radio the packs.

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:48.069
See if you can reestablish comm.

01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:51.828
All communication's dead, sir.

01:09:51.828 --> 01:09:54.108
Reestablish communications. Try again.

01:09:54.108 --> 01:09:55.556
Aye.

01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:04.189
Captain, octopus approaching, 300 meters off the port bow.

01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:05.583
Right full rudder.

01:10:05.583 --> 01:10:07.202
Right full rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:09.083
- Captain... - Not now, Doctor.

01:10:10.778 --> 01:10:13.075
Captain, I know these waters well.

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:16.132
There's a massive ice stretch not 50 clicks from here.

01:10:16.132 --> 01:10:16.782
Ice stretch?

01:10:16.782 --> 01:10:18.376
I've researched there.

01:10:18.376 --> 01:10:20.862
It's hairy, but we could lose them in that maze.

01:10:20.862 --> 01:10:24.025
He's right. We'll never outrun him in the open seas.

01:10:30.176 --> 01:10:31.789
Target closing, 100 meters.

01:10:31.789 --> 01:10:33.633
Engage emergency turbos now.

01:10:33.633 --> 01:10:36.556
But, sir, we'll overheat the engines and crack the core.

01:10:36.556 --> 01:10:41.005
Helmsman, that's an order! Engage emergency turbo pods now!

01:10:41.175 --> 01:10:43.345
Emergency turbos activated now.

01:10:43.345 --> 01:10:45.748
Aye, aye, sir.

01:10:48.233 --> 01:10:50.384
[mouthing words]

01:10:56.730 --> 01:11:01.203
If we don't go hot, people, and gain ground, we're dying right here.

01:11:01.203 --> 01:11:04.001
- Speed increases, sir. Engines holding. - Roger.

01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:05.693
Distance from target increasing, Captain.

01:11:05.693 --> 01:11:08.359
Plot us an immediate course from Perry's Sled.

01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:10.197
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:21.737
Doctor.

01:11:21.737 --> 01:11:25.171
We've detected long-range disturbances on our scope.

01:11:28.593 --> 01:11:31.250
[beeping] Multiple Seawolf class signals near the Arctic Circle.

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:32.461
That must be them.

01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:36.062
Followed by severe disruptions that may or may not be explosions.

01:11:36.062 --> 01:11:37.113
Explosions?

01:11:37.113 --> 01:11:42.272
Also, my latest reading displays only one visible C-class Wolf submarine.

01:11:42.272 --> 01:11:45.108
The rest vanished.

01:11:45.108 --> 01:11:46.703
Only one.

01:11:47.751 --> 01:11:49.979
Radio Baxter's sub.

01:11:49.979 --> 01:11:52.708
Tried raising all vessels from Baxter's Wolf Pack, sir.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.029
No reply.

01:11:54.029 --> 01:11:56.195
It may only be a communications failure.

01:11:56.195 --> 01:12:00.677
Deepwater interference or impact on the communication system itself.

01:12:00.677 --> 01:12:02.245
What just happened?

01:12:02.245 --> 01:12:04.590
Impossible to know at this time.

01:12:05.043 --> 01:12:10.314
We must remain optimistic and rush to the aid of whoever has survived.

01:12:10.314 --> 01:12:13.505
Navigator, plot an intercept course. Make haste.

01:12:14.385 --> 01:12:17.035
Approaching fresh transmission, 100 meters.

01:12:17.035 --> 01:12:20.349
- Sir, Should I reduce speed, sir? - Negative. Hold current speed.

01:12:23.355 --> 01:12:26.349
Target gone. No sign of the octopus.

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.494
Best guess...what's the width of that range?

01:12:30.494 --> 01:12:32.298
Tight.

01:12:41.412 --> 01:12:43.745
[sonar pinging] Bounce-back's giving me a rough estimate, Captain.

01:12:43.745 --> 01:12:46.429
Width no more than 25 meters.

01:12:50.105 --> 01:12:53.091
[pinging continues] Sir, target has returned. Looks like the shark.

01:12:53.091 --> 01:12:53.858
How wide are we?

01:12:53.858 --> 01:12:56.726
- 22.8 meters. - Pretty tight.

01:12:59.196 --> 01:13:00.597
Target distance?

01:13:00.597 --> 01:13:03.039
75 meters and closing.

01:13:14.773 --> 01:13:17.518
- Captain... - Range opening, 20 meters.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.071
Keep her steady now.

01:13:22.071 --> 01:13:24.057
Oh, Captain...

01:13:26.341 --> 01:13:29.345
- Can't make it! - Steady.

01:13:31.252 --> 01:13:33.444
Captain, he...

01:13:35.083 --> 01:13:37.694
Keep her steady.

01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:41.644
Reducing speed now!

01:13:44.926 --> 01:13:46.647
Increase speed now!

01:13:46.647 --> 01:13:48.212
We're going to hit the walls!

01:13:48.212 --> 01:13:50.352
Increase speed now!

01:13:50.352 --> 01:13:51.571
Negative!

01:13:51.571 --> 01:13:53.114
You're insane!

01:13:53.114 --> 01:13:54.752
You're going to kill us all!

01:13:55.239 --> 01:13:59.369
- Drop your weapon! - Range opening, 10 meters. Target's still closing.

01:14:01.128 --> 01:14:03.495
Drop your weapon!

01:14:04.747 --> 01:14:06.856
Get back!

01:14:07.303 --> 01:14:10.508
Get back! You're insane!

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:22.741
[crash] Speed restored.

01:14:22.741 --> 01:14:24.575
We're going in.

01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:27.214
Hold on, everybody!

01:14:27.214 --> 01:14:28.816
Breaches on Deck 4 and 5.

01:14:28.816 --> 01:14:30.310
Ice wall dead ahead.

01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:31.974
Hard right!

01:14:33.687 --> 01:14:35.701
How many fish left, Sergeant?

01:14:35.701 --> 01:14:36.975
Just one.

01:14:36.975 --> 01:14:39.360
Ready 2, number 3.

01:14:40.397 --> 01:14:41.523
[beeping] Ready.

01:14:41.523 --> 01:14:43.181
Fire!

01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:47.700
Crushed it!

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.479
[all cheering]

01:14:51.585 --> 01:14:53.313
Captain.

01:14:53.313 --> 01:14:54.264
Go ahead.

01:14:54.264 --> 01:14:56.488
Target is still closing.

01:15:01.356 --> 01:15:05.640
Target approaching at 3, 2...

01:15:07.857 --> 01:15:11.747
Captain, I'm picking up a massive underwater disturbance.

01:15:11.747 --> 01:15:14.232
Two bogeys. Hard to say what they're doing.

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:18.608
It's working. They're together. They're fighting.

01:15:26.336 --> 01:15:28.394
What's happening? Who's got the upper hand?

01:15:30.416 --> 01:15:33.987
Impossible to tell. It's just a massive sound.

01:15:35.851 --> 01:15:37.124
[growling]

01:15:47.203 --> 01:15:52.335
Sir, the targets have separated.

01:15:52.822 --> 01:15:56.353
[Sanders] They're just licking their wounds. It's not over yet.

01:16:02.711 --> 01:16:06.600
Captain, the two bogeys have split apart. Both still active.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.867
Could we just get out of here and not wait around to find out what happens?

01:16:09.867 --> 01:16:11.098
Bring us up to periscope depth.

01:16:11.098 --> 01:16:11.809
Aye, sir.

01:16:11.809 --> 01:16:13.446
Good job, Sanders. Can you handle this?

01:16:13.446 --> 01:16:15.066
Just like riding a bicycle, sir.

01:16:15.066 --> 01:16:17.540
Good right hook, by the way.

01:16:24.849 --> 01:16:29.241
We'll bridge the last recorded position with the American sub attack.

01:16:29.241 --> 01:16:32.405
Are you sure? There's nothing here, sir.

01:16:32.405 --> 01:16:32.661
[static]

01:16:33.183 --> 01:16:35.905
Whatever ship survived couldn't have gone that far.

01:16:35.905 --> 01:16:37.860
That's just showing no reading at all?

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.617
It's blank.

01:16:38.617 --> 01:16:40.262
Perhaps sheep sunk as well.

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:41.879
No. Never.

01:16:41.879 --> 01:16:43.274
What the heck..Hang on.

01:16:43.274 --> 01:16:48.046
There's large underwater activity due north, in the vicinity of Perry's Sled.

01:16:48.046 --> 01:16:50.198
Of course. The sled.

01:16:51.395 --> 01:16:53.068
This is where we should head.

01:16:53.068 --> 01:16:55.557
Are you mad? It's impossible to navigate.

01:16:55.557 --> 01:16:58.540
And the scope shows there's probably been a massive avalanche as well.

01:16:58.540 --> 01:16:59.981
Or something else.

01:16:59.981 --> 01:17:01.642
Set the course, Captain.

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.955
[sonar pinging] Sir, both targets have disappeared.

01:17:14.955 --> 01:17:15.765
What?

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:18.527
I don't know. They were on my scopes a minute ago, and now they're gone.

01:17:18.527 --> 01:17:22.487
Maybe they've actually done it. They could be diving to nurse wounds or..

01:17:22.487 --> 01:17:24.771
Die? Dying would be good.

01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:26.784
Communications...any luck?

01:17:26.784 --> 01:17:28.989
Barely online. Short-range only.

01:17:28.989 --> 01:17:31.675
Well, that's something. See if you can raise Shimada's sub.

01:17:31.675 --> 01:17:33.495
Aye.

01:17:35.268 --> 01:17:36.802
I know these waters.

01:17:36.802 --> 01:17:38.388
How?

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:41.523
I hung out with a bunch of whales here once.

01:17:46.418 --> 01:17:48.862
Hey, Captain, can I take a look?

01:17:48.862 --> 01:17:50.926
Yeah.

01:17:58.737 --> 01:18:03.534
[beeping] Just when you think there's no logic and life's just a total random mess.

01:18:04.321 --> 01:18:06.951
[crash] Something hit us!

01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:09.852
Walls collapsing, sir. Multiple breaches impossible to contain!

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:10.725
[alarm blaring] Surface down!

01:18:10.725 --> 01:18:13.116
I'm trying. Nonrepsonsive.

01:18:18.109 --> 01:18:21.387
Open the pins. Get the missiles hot.

01:18:21.387 --> 01:18:23.220
Aye, aye, sir!

01:18:23.505 --> 01:18:25.528
[beeping] At this range, they're going to kill us.

01:18:25.528 --> 01:18:26.261
Stand down!

01:18:26.261 --> 01:18:27.956
We need to get to the mini-sub.

01:18:28.566 --> 01:18:31.718
Jammed the claws hook. We can't lock on!

01:18:31.718 --> 01:18:32.677
Just let me through there!

01:18:32.677 --> 01:18:34.016
Keep trying!

01:18:34.016 --> 01:18:36.495
[Man] Sir, it's headed right for us!

01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:39.039
Captain, the mini-sub.

01:18:39.039 --> 01:18:41.308
Go, go, go! Go!

01:18:44.866 --> 01:18:47.251
[crash] You can't beat this. You must abandon ship.

01:18:47.251 --> 01:18:49.332
No. Go!

01:18:50.488 --> 01:18:54.192
- Get us the hell out of here now! - Back off!

01:18:54.469 --> 01:18:55.671
Detach now.

01:18:55.671 --> 01:18:56.748
Detach.

01:18:59.956 --> 01:19:02.177
[Man] Sir, it's headed right for us.

01:19:04.256 --> 01:19:06.091
Fire torpedoes!

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.803
Good hit!

01:19:10.803 --> 01:19:12.059
Hang on!

01:19:18.341 --> 01:19:21.492
Emma, move it. We're not going to make it.

01:19:23.416 --> 01:19:25.704
Gotcha!

01:19:25.704 --> 01:19:26.910
What happened?

01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:28.501
Over there.

01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:30.531
Holy, Mother of God.

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:32.978
Seiji.

01:19:33.342 --> 01:19:35.793
Well, I'll be damned.

01:19:40.983 --> 01:19:42.250
Yeah!

01:20:02.041 --> 01:20:05.534
Seiji. No.

01:20:07.187 --> 01:20:09.165
What the hell are you doing?

01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:11.923
- Going in.- To do what?

01:20:11.923 --> 01:20:14.857
- To save my friend. - You can't do that. You'll kill us all. Lamar?

01:20:14.857 --> 01:20:16.742
It's too late, EM

01:20:30.866 --> 01:20:34.710
[Sanders] I knew they couldn't stay away from each other.

01:21:37.421 --> 01:21:43.013
Looks like they finally finished what they started 18 million years ago.

01:22:15.428 --> 01:22:18.891
[Shimada on Radio] Can anyone read me?

01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:22.026
This is Shimada. Over.

01:22:22.026 --> 01:22:24.784
- There! 2 O'clock - This is Shimada.

01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:29.023
This is Shimada. Over. Can anyone read me?

01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:31.810
Emma!

01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:33.425
I don't believe it.

01:22:55.443 --> 01:22:57.961
I'm glad you stayed a few more days.

01:22:57.961 --> 01:23:02.488
Well, I was thinking maybe I could stay a little longer.

01:23:02.488 --> 01:23:03.986
What do you mean?

01:23:03.986 --> 01:23:07.806
I mean, with no more giant sea creatures around,

01:23:07.806 --> 01:23:12.538
I guess I could stay as long as you wanted me to stay.

01:23:12.538 --> 01:23:17.063
Well, you know I'm not the stay-at-home-and-cook kind of gal, right?

01:23:17.063 --> 01:23:19.274
I'm a mermaid.

01:23:19.274 --> 01:23:21.486
My home is out there.

01:23:24.095 --> 01:23:26.715
The sea.

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:28.535
Just like you.

01:23:36.356 --> 01:23:40.105
You know, only 8% of the ocean's gone unexplored.

01:23:40.105 --> 01:23:41.981
Sounds like a challenge.

01:23:42.301 --> 01:23:45.967
Have you ever seen a pod of whales swim to Mozart?

01:23:45.967 --> 01:23:49.163
I think I may have to soon.

01:23:52.855 --> 01:23:54.933
[Sanders] Emma. Seiji.

01:23:54.933 --> 01:23:56.636
Lamar.

01:23:57.670 --> 01:24:00.349
Oh, no, no, no. You have that look.

01:24:00.672 --> 01:24:03.574
- Well, I was thinking... - Oh, no, no, no, Professor.

01:24:03.574 --> 01:24:06.410
Finding those two creatures was a once-in-a-lifetime event.

01:24:08.646 --> 01:24:12.037
- Hmm. What's this? - Another lifetime.

01:24:14.389 --> 01:24:17.420
Infrared. Photo of what?

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:22.250
Some sort of organic life...preserved.

01:24:22.585 --> 01:24:24.065
Where were these taken?

01:24:24.065 --> 01:24:26.690
The North Sea.

01:24:27.373 --> 01:24:28.537
You ready?

01:24:28.537 --> 01:24:30.335
Hell, yeah. You?

01:24:30.335 --> 01:24:32.708
Let's go.
