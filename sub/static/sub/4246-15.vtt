WEBVTT

00:01.791 --> 00:03.259
(Fitz)
That wasn't a mistake.

00:04.226 --> 00:05.994
That was betrayal.
We are done.

00:06.061 --> 00:07.561
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:07.629 --> 00:09.263
(Mike) The bartender saw you
leaving McGhee's together

00:09.331 --> 00:10.998
the night she was
stabbed to death.

00:11.065 --> 00:12.833
(David) She'd just started
downloading my Defiance files

00:12.901 --> 00:13.768
when she died.
(Computer beeps)

00:13.836 --> 00:17.036
There's high-level classified
military intelligence on there.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.971
(Cyrus) Four Americans have
been kidnapped abroad.

00:19.039 --> 00:21.107
They're our top C.I.A. assets
in the region, Mr. President.

00:21.175 --> 00:22.509
Do you want to tell me
how they got their hands

00:22.576 --> 00:24.444
- on legitimate U.S. operatives?
- We have a mole.

00:24.812 --> 00:26.078
(Olivia)
So what <i>is</i> your thing?

00:26.146 --> 00:28.682
People watching.
How's 8:00 on Friday sound?

00:28.749 --> 00:30.149
<i>See you then,</i>
<i>captain Ballard.</i>

01:03.515 --> 01:07.184
(Indistinct conversation)

01:07.252 --> 01:10.787
(Sighs)

01:10.856 --> 01:12.589
I'm so sorry.
This is not...

01:12.657 --> 01:14.458
I'm not a late person,

01:14.525 --> 01:16.593
and I don't want you to think
our meeting isn't a priority.

01:16.661 --> 01:18.095
- It's a date.
- What?

01:18.163 --> 01:20.130
You said "meeting."
I'm not a client.

01:20.198 --> 01:22.298
I don't have a problem.
I don't need fixing.

01:22.366 --> 01:25.468
I asked you out.
You said yes. We dressed up.

01:25.535 --> 01:27.136
At the end of the evening,
if all goes well,

01:27.204 --> 01:29.405
there will be... kissing.

01:29.473 --> 01:30.974
This is not a meeting.
This is a date. (Paper rips)

01:31.041 --> 01:32.842
And I don't want to insult you.
You chose this restaurant.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.110
I'm sure the food is very good.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.644
But this is not
a date restaurant.

01:35.712 --> 01:37.746
We can't have a date here.
This is where dates go to die.

01:37.813 --> 01:39.982
(Chair scrapes floor)

01:40.049 --> 01:41.917
You look extraordinary,
by the way.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.520
So let's go.

01:53.795 --> 01:56.931
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

01:56.999 --> 01:59.066
Tell me this is not
a fantastic spot for a date.

01:59.101 --> 02:00.868
It's not bad.

02:00.936 --> 02:02.203
You're hard to please.

02:02.271 --> 02:04.372
I like that.
I like a challenge.

02:04.439 --> 02:07.208
- What's albatross?
- I'm sorry. What?

02:07.242 --> 02:09.008
Wendy was working on
something called albatross,

02:09.076 --> 02:10.476
and I'm guessing that since
she reached out to you,

02:10.544 --> 02:11.844
that you know what it is.

02:11.879 --> 02:14.281
Wow, you really suck at dating.

02:14.382 --> 02:15.848
I never said this was a date,
you did.

02:15.917 --> 02:17.650
- Ouch.
- Albatross.

02:17.684 --> 02:19.185
We are on date,

02:19.253 --> 02:21.021
from which I will give you
a 30 second break

02:21.122 --> 02:22.989
to answer your question.
That is all, okay?

02:23.057 --> 02:24.857
Go.

02:24.925 --> 02:27.459
Couple of years ago,
a guy from the state department

02:27.560 --> 02:30.495
gets busted selling classified
documents to Tehran.

02:30.596 --> 02:32.298
Pretty big deal, made
even bigger by the fact

02:32.365 --> 02:34.300
that the day they were going
to issue his arrest warrant,

02:34.367 --> 02:36.501
he pulls into his parking
spot on K street

02:36.536 --> 02:38.670
and blows his brains out
with a colt .38.

02:38.738 --> 02:40.372
Now, the guy says
in his suicide note

02:40.407 --> 02:41.539
that he was framed,
that he wasn't the mole,

02:41.606 --> 02:42.974
he didn't know
who the mole was,

02:43.075 --> 02:44.642
didn't know anything about him,
except for the fact

02:44.743 --> 02:46.344
that he went by an alias.

02:46.412 --> 02:47.946
Albatross.

02:47.980 --> 02:49.480
Now, no one believed the guy.

02:49.548 --> 02:51.649
The case was airtight,
but the story became a legend.

02:51.716 --> 02:53.251
So now, whenever anyone in
the intelligence community

02:53.319 --> 02:56.087
- messes up
- They blame it on albatross.

02:56.121 --> 02:57.720
So, when Wendy was
reaching out to you......

02:57.788 --> 02:59.122
No, no, your time is up.
The date is back on.

02:59.190 --> 03:00.490
- Captain Ballard...
- Jake.

03:00.558 --> 03:02.193
All my dates call me "Jake."

03:03.861 --> 03:05.228
You do not give up.

03:05.296 --> 03:07.797
I'm a Navy man.
Navy men do not give up.

03:07.865 --> 03:09.599
- Neither do I.
- Like I said,

03:09.667 --> 03:11.768
I like a challenge.

03:15.939 --> 03:17.606
(Cell phone chimes)

03:17.675 --> 03:19.976
(Chimes)

03:20.044 --> 03:23.479
(Chimes)

03:23.547 --> 03:24.513
(Beep)

03:24.581 --> 03:25.548
Hello?

03:27.217 --> 03:28.417
I'll be right there.

03:28.485 --> 03:29.851
Ten minutes.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.486
(Beep) Date's over.

03:31.554 --> 03:33.021
Thought this wasn't a date.

03:33.089 --> 03:34.422
I was being nice.

03:34.490 --> 03:36.858
- Mm.
- Good night, captain.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.727
Jake.

03:38.795 --> 03:43.298
(Footsteps depart)

03:43.365 --> 03:44.900
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

03:44.967 --> 03:46.300
- Day eight.
- Fitz...

03:46.367 --> 03:48.368
Day eight!
They're running a damn tally

03:48.436 --> 03:50.604
of the most glaring failure
of my presidency

03:50.672 --> 03:52.639
on every network on a loop,

03:52.708 --> 03:54.441
while we, for all apparent
purposes, do nothing.

03:54.509 --> 03:56.577
You are doing everything
to get those hostages back safe.

03:56.644 --> 03:58.045
It's not your fault
the intelligence

03:58.113 --> 03:59.947
simply isn't there.

04:00.015 --> 04:02.248
What if you
reached out personally

04:02.316 --> 04:04.383
- to the families, told them...
- What?

04:04.451 --> 04:06.252
That we have no clue
where their loved ones are,

04:06.320 --> 04:08.154
who exactly has them
or how to get them back?

04:08.222 --> 04:11.324
But, you know,
tie another ribbon.

04:11.391 --> 04:13.793
You need a break.
You haven't been sleeping. (Exhales)

04:13.861 --> 04:15.995
This thing has been consuming you
day and night. (Pouring drink)

04:16.063 --> 04:18.029
Don't wait up.
I have work to do.

04:18.098 --> 04:19.064
(Kisses)

04:22.401 --> 04:24.903
(Door opens and closes)

04:27.207 --> 04:28.907
- He's here, sir.
- Send him in.

04:33.746 --> 04:34.879
(Sighs)

04:36.815 --> 04:39.851
Mr. President, sir.

04:39.918 --> 04:41.418
(Door closes)

04:43.421 --> 04:44.822
Son of a bitch.

04:44.890 --> 04:47.125
"Mr. President"... I'll never
get over saying that.

04:47.192 --> 04:48.592
Jake.

04:50.494 --> 04:51.895
- How are you?
- I'm good.

04:51.963 --> 04:53.196
You want a drink?

04:53.264 --> 04:54.297
We're drinking.

04:56.533 --> 04:59.269
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

04:59.336 --> 05:02.672
sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

05:02.740 --> 05:04.207
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

05:04.275 --> 05:06.475
Someone's following you?

05:06.542 --> 05:07.676
Yes.

05:07.744 --> 05:09.544
(Door closes)
(Sniffs) All of a sudden?

05:09.612 --> 05:11.180
(Clears throat)
How do you know?

05:11.248 --> 05:12.381
Just I know.
It's a feeling.

05:12.449 --> 05:13.750
- Can you describe them?
- That's easy.

05:13.817 --> 05:15.818
They're very scary
and extremely invisible.

05:15.986 --> 05:17.119
I have no idea
what they look like.

05:17.187 --> 05:18.988
I see a car in my rearview
mirror, and I hear

05:19.055 --> 05:20.956
footsteps behind me.
I turn around, they're gone.

05:21.024 --> 05:22.657
Well, if this phantom menace
is real, as long as they

05:22.724 --> 05:24.125
think Wendy's flash drive
is still out there,

05:24.193 --> 05:26.527
they're gonna stop
until they k...

05:26.595 --> 05:29.197
Until they kill me? That's what
you were gonna say, right?

05:29.265 --> 05:30.564
Smooth.

05:30.632 --> 05:32.500
(Inhales) Ugh!
(David sighs)

05:32.567 --> 05:34.502
We need to find out
what albatross is.

05:34.569 --> 05:35.837
(Olivia) He's a mole.
A made-up one,

05:35.905 --> 05:37.538
as far as the intelligence
community's concerned,

05:37.606 --> 05:39.206
the stuff of legend...
athough given the files

05:39.274 --> 05:40.707
- we found on this flash drive...
- Maybe he really exists.

05:40.775 --> 05:41.909
So this Wendy girl... what?

05:41.976 --> 05:43.177
She... she stole the files
from this guy?

05:43.244 --> 05:45.012
- Realizing what she had,
- Then got killed

05:45.079 --> 05:46.313
before she was able
to do anything about it.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.916
If this stuff is so top secret,
why aren't we...

05:48.983 --> 05:50.717
(Olivia)
Why aren't we what, Quinn?

05:50.785 --> 05:52.886
Um... (Exhales) Why aren't we
handing them over

05:52.954 --> 05:54.787
- to someone in the administration?
- We don't have all the facts.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.823
We also covered up a murder
and messed with a crime scene.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.757
If we turn in that flash drive,
we screw ourselves.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.592
20% of the albatross files
were encrypted.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.428
I've got three computers
working on it right now.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.598
- What's the time frame, Huck?
- No, this stuff's from the Pentagon.

06:04.599 --> 06:06.065
They have got firewalls
aside their firewalls.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.367
I'll get through them, but we're
talking days, not hours.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.902
Once that's done, we may have
a better idea who our mole is.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.170
Well, it's probably the same
person who's following me,

06:12.238 --> 06:13.504
just waiting for
the right moment to shoot me

06:13.572 --> 06:15.540
or run me over or drown me
in my own toilet.

06:15.607 --> 06:17.008
Huck will trail you
for the next couple of days,

06:17.076 --> 06:18.443
make sure you're not in danger.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.316
(Sniffs)

06:24.383 --> 06:26.917
- Does Huck...
- Stink? Yes. To high heaven.

06:26.985 --> 06:28.385
(Door closes) Like he
hasn't showered in days.

06:28.453 --> 06:30.154
At least David will
always know where he is.

06:30.222 --> 06:32.556
(Harris and Quinn laugh)

06:32.623 --> 06:34.758
You see any of the guys?

06:34.826 --> 06:36.727
Uh, lucky's C.E.O.
of some big tech firm now.

06:36.794 --> 06:38.329
Patty and Rick...
They fly for the airlines.

06:38.396 --> 06:39.964
You know Coney's teaching
at Annapolis?

06:40.031 --> 06:41.798
Coney is shaping young minds?
(Laughs)

06:41.866 --> 06:43.333
Poor kids.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.934
They all follow you.

06:45.002 --> 06:48.304
They call me, like I've got
some direct line to the Oval...

06:48.372 --> 06:49.805
It's good to see you.

06:49.874 --> 06:51.507
In person, I mean.

06:51.575 --> 06:53.276
You're a hard man to get to these days.
(Inhales)

06:53.344 --> 06:54.744
That's a thing you don't
bank on.

06:54.811 --> 06:56.379
You work your ass off
to get to the White House,

06:56.446 --> 06:58.713
then here you are and...

06:58.781 --> 07:02.184
I didn't count on
the isolation.

07:03.819 --> 07:06.588
It makes you do things.

07:06.655 --> 07:09.457
Color outside the lines.

07:09.525 --> 07:10.959
Fitz...

07:11.027 --> 07:12.594
- You don't have to keep...
- I'm happy to.

07:12.661 --> 07:14.628
I never should have asked
Tom to call you.

07:14.696 --> 07:16.463
I'm happy to do any favor
you ask of me. You know that.

07:16.531 --> 07:18.432
It's done. I'm doing it.
I've been doing it.

07:22.670 --> 07:24.438
- How is she?
- She's good.

07:24.506 --> 07:27.041
Quiet. Makes my job easy.
Spends most of her time working.

07:27.109 --> 07:28.609
She took up swimming recently.

07:28.676 --> 07:30.144
She was on the swim team
in high school. (Chuckles)

07:30.212 --> 07:31.378
Sir?

07:31.446 --> 07:32.880
Nothing. What else?

07:32.947 --> 07:35.482
She reads a lot,
watches the news... a lot.

07:35.550 --> 07:37.718
She doesn't sleep enough.
She's...

07:39.687 --> 07:41.187
What?

07:41.255 --> 07:43.424
She's unhappy.
She doesn't date.

07:43.491 --> 07:45.091
I think maybe the breakup
with senator Davis

07:45.159 --> 07:48.027
- might have been hard on her.
- I don't think so.

07:48.094 --> 07:49.862
I know Davis.

07:49.930 --> 07:52.532
He was serious.
She wasn't.

07:54.468 --> 07:57.136
If you don't mind my asking,
we've made the jump

07:57.203 --> 07:59.639
from photo surveillance
to video surveillance.

08:01.408 --> 08:03.207
That's not a question.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.276
I was wondering why.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.247
I have my reasons.

08:10.683 --> 08:11.983
(Sighs)

08:12.051 --> 08:13.452
Well, it would help
if I knew your reasons.

08:13.519 --> 08:14.786
If I'm the one watching
the feed,

08:14.854 --> 08:15.720
I need to know
what to look for.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.656
Have you seen anything yet?

08:17.723 --> 08:20.190
Well, it... might be nothing,
but she could be getting

08:20.258 --> 08:23.226
into something interesting,
possibly dangerous with work.

08:23.294 --> 08:26.263
I'm not sure yet.
It's...It's too soon to tell.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.664
(Cap clatters)

08:27.731 --> 08:29.799
Fitz, my professional opinion
is she seems harmless,

08:29.867 --> 08:33.169
so unless this is personal...

08:33.236 --> 08:35.438
You're watching tapes
and looking at photos.

08:35.506 --> 08:36.940
You don't know her.

08:37.006 --> 08:39.642
Olivia Pope is not what she seems.

08:39.710 --> 08:41.344
Of course. I didn't...
I'm s...

08:41.410 --> 08:44.245
I didn't mean to...
It's just I'm... (Sighs)

08:45.982 --> 08:48.517
She's not a good person.

08:48.585 --> 08:50.752
Not the way you think.

08:50.820 --> 08:53.355
And this isn't personal.
Nothing about this is personal.

08:53.422 --> 08:54.957
Of course.
I didn't mean to imply...

08:55.024 --> 08:57.025
No.
I get it.

08:57.093 --> 08:59.259
It's okay.
Just...

09:01.262 --> 09:02.530
Stay on her.

09:16.313 --> 09:17.914
(Both chuckle)

09:17.982 --> 09:19.983
You're still in the office.
Do you know what time it is?

09:20.050 --> 09:22.352
Fun never ends
around here, senator.

09:22.419 --> 09:25.288
- How you been, Liv?
- Busy. And you?

09:25.356 --> 09:28.257
- That's Peter Caldwell of 
the Caldwells. - Gold star.

09:28.324 --> 09:29.557
- The Caldwells are clients?
- So?

09:29.625 --> 09:31.626
So they're one of the
dirtiest political dynasties

09:31.694 --> 09:33.362
in American history.

09:33.429 --> 09:35.097
What can I do for you, Peter?

09:35.164 --> 09:37.232
Well, it's not me this time, Liv.
It's my brother... Will.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.234
He's making a play
for the North Carolina

09:39.302 --> 09:41.103
- Governor's mansion.
- I heard.

09:41.170 --> 09:42.737
Congressman Will Caldwell,
heir to the famous

09:42.805 --> 09:44.772
Caldwell republican dynasty.

09:44.839 --> 09:47.108
(Wild cherry) ♪ hey,
once I was a funky singer ♪

09:47.175 --> 09:49.576
So this is where the Caldwell
magic is happening?

09:49.644 --> 09:51.913
Ground zero.
You remember my wife Marion.

09:51.980 --> 09:53.647
Ah. Of course.
Thank you for coming.

09:53.715 --> 09:55.316
Oh, the man of the hour.

09:55.384 --> 09:57.451
Olivia. Back with us again.
What happened?

09:57.519 --> 09:59.652
Chip fall off the wagon?
Josie make another sex tape?

09:59.720 --> 10:01.521
Who's in crisis today?

10:01.588 --> 10:02.822
You are, Will.

10:02.890 --> 10:04.324
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

10:04.392 --> 10:05.558
How's polling?

10:05.626 --> 10:06.793
Got the race in the bag
if he wasn't...

10:06.860 --> 10:08.628
So gay?

10:08.695 --> 10:11.164
I read the gossip rags.
It's my job to be well-informed.

10:11.232 --> 10:12.532
- I'm not gay!
- Will, come on!

10:12.599 --> 10:14.801
- I am not gay!
- Then why are you still single?

10:14.868 --> 10:17.702
I'm sowing my oats.
I don't want to settle down.

10:17.770 --> 10:19.905
You haven't dated anyone
in the last ten years.

10:19.973 --> 10:21.073
And don't tell me
that you have,

10:21.141 --> 10:22.174
because I did my homework on you.

10:22.242 --> 10:23.909
You don't date,
you don't go out,

10:23.977 --> 10:25.978
you don't meet women, and you
don't have sex with anybody.

10:26.046 --> 10:28.247
Why?

10:28.315 --> 10:29.681
The rumors are killing
his chances.

10:29.749 --> 10:31.682
We have a giant
fund-raiser coming up,

10:31.750 --> 10:33.751
and our conservative donors
are fleeing for the hills.

10:33.819 --> 10:35.686
Best way to quash rumors
is go with the truth.

10:35.754 --> 10:37.455
Come on, Liv. You can't be
elected a gay Governor

10:37.522 --> 10:38.957
- in a red state.
- Says who?

10:39.025 --> 10:41.993
- You want me to be the first gay
Governor of North Carolina? - Yep.

10:42.361 --> 10:44.095
Well, that'll be difficult,
Olivia, because I'm not gay.

10:44.163 --> 10:45.629
He needs a wife.

10:45.697 --> 10:47.197
We do that?

10:47.265 --> 10:49.099
Peter, I don't need
to get married.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.600
You belong in the
Governor's mansion.

10:50.668 --> 10:52.602
We're just trying to figure out
the best way to get you there.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.671
You sound just like mom.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.506
(Abby) Older brother Peter's
a senator from Indiana.

10:56.574 --> 10:58.475
Has four kids with wife Marion.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.710
Peter holds the family together,
and, boy, do they need it.

11:00.778 --> 11:02.412
Sister's the Texas Attorney General

11:02.480 --> 11:04.246
with a coke problem.

11:04.314 --> 11:05.448
Father was Governor
of Tennessee,

11:05.515 --> 11:06.949
bid for the White House.

11:07.017 --> 11:09.085
Failed when they discovered
his secret Canadian family.

11:09.152 --> 11:10.353
♪

11:10.420 --> 11:12.821
Fine. Canadian mistress.
But she did have a kid.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.656
Before we go down
the fake wife road,

11:14.724 --> 11:16.625
why don't we ask will
what <i>he</i> wants?

11:16.693 --> 11:19.394
Gay I could work with.

11:19.462 --> 11:21.196
Gay I could get elected.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.864
Gay I could take all the way.
Give me ten years,

11:22.931 --> 11:24.265
and I can make a gay president.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.700
- Will...
- I'm not gay.

11:25.767 --> 11:27.168
So we have a problem,
because this...

11:27.236 --> 11:30.638
Single, celibate, no
women or men anywhere,

11:30.706 --> 11:33.141
no virility, no testosterone,
no passion...

11:33.209 --> 11:34.742
- That's fatal.
- Hold on...

11:34.810 --> 11:36.543
When's the last time
a single man

11:36.611 --> 11:38.212
has been elected
to the Governor's mansion

11:38.279 --> 11:39.813
in any state
in the last 40 years?

11:39.881 --> 11:41.281
When?

11:41.349 --> 11:43.250
People don't like a guy
they can't place.

11:43.318 --> 11:45.352
A married man, a widower,

11:45.420 --> 11:48.455
a divorced dad, a gay partner...
They get that.

11:48.523 --> 11:50.824
A single guy
with no sign of anyone?

11:50.892 --> 11:52.625
No love life?

11:52.692 --> 11:54.927
People don't trust it,
and they won't vote for it,

11:54.995 --> 11:56.929
not even the most liberal
of your constituents,

11:56.997 --> 11:58.264
and we're in a red state,

11:58.332 --> 11:59.565
so that's about 20 people
to begin with.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.501
It's an uphill battle

12:01.568 --> 12:03.536
that you don't want to fight,
Will, because you won't win.

12:03.603 --> 12:06.739
You've got this, Will.
You are good at this game.

12:06.806 --> 12:09.274
You could take the Caldwell name
all the way.

12:09.342 --> 12:10.509
The White House.

12:13.046 --> 12:14.079
(Sighs)

12:14.147 --> 12:15.847
What do you think, Marion?

12:15.915 --> 12:17.649
You weren't raised
by political wolves.

12:17.716 --> 12:20.385
You might still
have a soul in there.

12:20.453 --> 12:23.754
This is your dream, Will.
You've worked so hard for it.

12:23.821 --> 12:25.156
Be a shame
to throw it away now.

12:27.959 --> 12:30.661
(Sighs)

12:30.728 --> 12:32.729
Let's find me a fake wife.

12:32.797 --> 12:34.865
♪ Yeah, and they was dancin'
and singin' ♪

12:34.933 --> 12:38.769
So, who wants to marry
into this lovely family?

12:38.836 --> 12:40.937
I was enrolled at Princeton.
Eating club and all.

12:41.004 --> 12:42.905
But I spent all my time
in New York

12:42.973 --> 12:45.308
hunting for fabric, so after
sophomore year I dropped out.

12:45.376 --> 12:47.410
Uh, not to be rude,
but why do you care?

12:47.478 --> 12:50.080
Compatibility will be
important in selling this.

12:50.147 --> 12:51.448
The public's smart.
They've seen

12:51.515 --> 12:53.416
enough fake reality shows
to know from true love.

12:53.484 --> 12:55.117
Plus you'll be spending a lot
of time with this person,

12:55.185 --> 12:57.419
so what do you look for
in a woman?

12:57.487 --> 12:59.054
So your father
was a preacher, right?

12:59.122 --> 13:00.722
Lutheran. Made me stand up
in front of the assembly

13:00.790 --> 13:02.424
every week
and read the bulletin.

13:02.492 --> 13:04.426
Now you're on air for BNC.
Makes sense.

13:04.494 --> 13:06.027
- So you a headhunter?
- (Laughs)

13:06.096 --> 13:08.163
It would help if she understood
my responsibilities

13:08.231 --> 13:09.798
as Governor
will have to come first.

13:09.865 --> 13:11.466
It would help if she was sexy
as hell, too.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.434
Let's start there.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.570
I've never been behind
forcing kids to pray in school.

13:15.637 --> 13:17.138
The point of my op-ed
in the "Sun"

13:17.206 --> 13:20.174
was to simply argue that
we might set aside the time

13:20.242 --> 13:21.275
for the students
who choose to pray.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.978
Who did you say you work for?

13:24.045 --> 13:25.846

13:25.914 --> 13:27.581
Where are we with David?

13:27.648 --> 13:28.948
Uh, apartment is clean.
There's no sign

13:29.017 --> 13:30.650
of anyone tailing him.
Stay on him just in case.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.018
- Okay.
- Ooh.

13:32.086 --> 13:33.220
Huck?

13:35.189 --> 13:37.557
- You okay?
- Yeah. Why?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.059
No reason.

13:43.230 --> 13:45.264
Whew.

13:54.807 --> 13:57.075
If you're looking for Liv,

13:57.144 --> 13:58.644
everyone went home.

13:58.711 --> 14:01.246
Just killing time.
Huck's checking out my car,

14:01.313 --> 14:04.449

14:23.168 --> 14:24.835
It isn't just
this hostage situation.

14:24.903 --> 14:26.771
Until you get to the bottom
of this security breach,

14:26.838 --> 14:28.305
I'm virtually paralyzed here!

14:28.373 --> 14:30.741
Any intelligence I get,
any action I take

14:30.809 --> 14:33.242
runs the risk of being
completely compromised.

14:33.310 --> 14:35.344
- Sir...
- I want a full court press.

14:35.412 --> 14:38.214
You eat at your desks,
you don't sleep or go home

14:38.282 --> 14:40.616

14:42.486 --> 14:43.820
Cyrus.

14:43.888 --> 14:45.254

- Hear me out.

16:21.820 --> 16:23.020
You were late to our first date.

16:23.087 --> 16:24.221
You chose a bad restaurant,

16:24.289 --> 16:25.955
forcing me to improvise.
You left early,

16:26.023 --> 16:27.490
and there was no kissing.

16:27.558 --> 16:29.759
You did not get the full
Jake Ballard experience.

16:29.827 --> 16:32.529
You're owed a second date.

16:32.596 --> 16:34.063
I could cheer you up.

16:34.131 --> 16:35.799
What makes you think
I need cheering up?

16:35.866 --> 16:37.367
Well, don't you?

16:37.435 --> 16:39.602
Jake, I don't date.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.337
Um, just...

16:41.404 --> 16:43.171
(Breath quavers)

16:43.239 --> 16:45.273
I'm sorry.
I'm just not dating right now.

16:45.342 --> 16:46.342
Why not?

16:48.044 --> 16:49.712
What was his name?
You want me to beat him up for you?

16:49.779 --> 16:52.080
Because clearly he was no good.

16:52.148 --> 16:53.248
Good-bye, Jake.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.688
(Sighs) Tell me we're doing
more than a press release.

17:35.755 --> 17:36.856
This is just
the initial statement.

17:36.924 --> 17:39.224
Fitz is also going to say something
from the Oval. He didn't tell you?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.459
He doesn't tell me
anything these days.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.762
- Ah, Cyrus...
- Words won't be enough.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.862
They cut the head off
of an American, Mellie.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.898
You do not answer that
with a pleasant sonnet.

17:46.966 --> 17:48.666
You get revenge...
blood for blood.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.068
Fitz is worried they will
kill another hostage.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.204
The terrorists
are state-sponsored,

if not officially,
then unofficially.

17:55.173 --> 17:56.408
During the day they
may not be drinking tea

17:56.475 --> 17:57.975
with Kashfar intelligence,

17:58.043 --> 17:59.944
but at night they are
sipping from their saucers.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.478
We need to send in drones,

18:01.546 --> 18:03.447
take out a couple
of their top guys.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.348
Or a wedding party.
It doesn't matter,

18:05.417 --> 18:07.684
just as long as you light
a fire under the Kashfaris.

18:07.752 --> 18:09.152
You hold them accountable,

18:09.220 --> 18:11.922
and they <i>will</i>
find the hostages for us.

18:13.925 --> 18:15.759
I'll pass it along.

18:15.827 --> 18:17.860
I'm gonna make sure he knows
this is your idea.

18:17.928 --> 18:19.295
Cy, he can't keep
shutting you out.

18:19.362 --> 18:20.563
You're too valuable.

18:20.631 --> 18:22.765
Well...

18:22.833 --> 18:25.701
Today, I've brought in little
chocolate bars... fun size.

18:25.769 --> 18:28.237
If you get a right answer,
I'll give you one of these bars.

18:28.305 --> 18:29.505
So let's get started.

18:29.573 --> 18:31.674
Who can tell me
who Lyndon Johnson was?

18:33.208 --> 18:35.009
It was in your reading
assignment, guys...

18:35.077 --> 18:36.511
All four pages of it.
(Sighs)

18:38.614 --> 18:40.214
One of our presidents?

18:40.282 --> 18:42.851
Yes. Yes, he was, Darren.
He was one of our presidents.

18:42.919 --> 18:45.119
Our 36th President,
to be exact.

18:45.187 --> 18:47.288
(Loud thud on window)

18:48.424 --> 18:50.558
Dude?
Dude?

18:50.625 --> 18:53.193
Dude?
Dude!

18:53.261 --> 18:55.262
My candy bar?

18:55.330 --> 18:57.197
Right.

19:26.092 --> 19:28.927
(Breathing heavily)

19:38.737 --> 19:41.639
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

19:41.707 --> 19:43.674
I don't get it.
He's gorgeous, successful.

19:43.741 --> 19:44.542
How come he doesn't date?

19:44.610 --> 19:46.077
- He's gay.
- Lots of people don't date.

19:46.145 --> 19:47.845
- He is gay. - Doesn't mean there's
something wrong with him.

19:48.413 --> 19:50.147
There's nothing wrong with it
if he was out of the closet,

19:50.215 --> 19:52.616
- but he's not. - I don't know.
Looks like there's a spark.

19:52.683 --> 19:54.250
Speaking of flammable,
you tell your partner in crime

19:54.318 --> 19:55.252
to take a shower yet?

19:56.020 --> 19:58.021
I think there might be
something wrong with him.

19:58.088 --> 20:00.490
He's Huck. There's something
very wrong with him.

20:00.558 --> 20:02.458
Doesn't give him a pass
on hygiene.

20:02.527 --> 20:04.093
(Laughs) All right.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.563
Nodding, leaning, eye contact.

20:06.631 --> 20:07.931
All good.
(Singsongy) Hey!

20:07.999 --> 20:10.198
(Normal voice)
Come on. Casual touch,

20:10.266 --> 20:12.100
and boom goes the dynamite.

20:15.304 --> 20:16.772
(Speaking inaudibly)

20:25.113 --> 20:28.049
Before you sign
on the dotted line, just...

20:28.116 --> 20:29.684
Take a minute, okay?

20:29.752 --> 20:31.953
(Chuckle) I know what
a political marriage is.

20:33.321 --> 20:34.689
There are upsides...

20:34.757 --> 20:36.558
The money, the houses,
the clothes.

20:36.625 --> 20:38.760
You'll be American royalty.
That's all true.

20:38.827 --> 20:40.961
But you'll also be put
under a microscope.

20:41.029 --> 20:43.096
Every move you make
will be scrutinized

20:43.164 --> 20:44.565
and held up for judgment.

20:44.632 --> 20:45.766
They'll never stop
watching you,

20:45.834 --> 20:47.801
because your life
isn't yours anymore.

20:47.869 --> 20:50.370
It's theirs...
The family's,

20:50.438 --> 20:52.372
because they bought you.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.741
And they're gonna want
what they paid for.

21:02.282 --> 21:04.850
<i>(Man) The Kashfari skies</i>
<i>were ablaze today,</i>

21:04.918 --> 21:08.187
<i>as U.S. drones bombed</i>
<i>key military installations,</i>

21:08.254 --> 21:10.255
<i>a move many Americans</i>
<i>are calling</i>

21:10.323 --> 21:11.691
<i>a much-needed show of strength</i>

21:11.758 --> 21:14.225
<i>on the part of</i>
<i>President Fitzgerald Grant.</i>

21:14.293 --> 21:16.761
<i>Although Kashfari government</i>
<i>officials have denied...</i>(Turns off tv)

21:16.829 --> 21:18.396
(Rain falling)

21:18.464 --> 21:19.998
72 hours,
Mr. Prime Minister...

21:20.066 --> 21:21.432
That's how much time you've got

21:21.500 --> 21:23.868
to find the hostages
and deliver them to us alive.

21:23.936 --> 21:26.838
Fail to do that, and I'll order
a second round of strikes.

21:26.906 --> 21:28.606
Have I made myself clear?

21:28.673 --> 21:30.908
Clock starts now.

21:30.976 --> 21:33.343
(Hangs up receiver)
Let's see if he bites.

21:33.411 --> 21:35.045
The press certainly did.

21:35.113 --> 21:39.282
They're calling today's strikes
a much-needed show of strength.

21:40.952 --> 21:42.653
I should listen
to my wife more often.

21:42.721 --> 21:44.187
What?

21:44.255 --> 21:45.788
The strikes were Mellie's idea.

21:45.856 --> 21:47.023
She called it
"blood for blood."

21:47.091 --> 21:48.858
The woman can't handle
a diaper change,

21:48.926 --> 21:51.260
but bombing a village?
No problem.

21:51.328 --> 21:52.795
(Laughter)

21:52.863 --> 21:54.631
Well done, sir.

21:54.698 --> 21:57.966
(Door opens)
(Door closes)

21:58.034 --> 21:59.268
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

21:59.336 --> 22:00.902
Mallory dropped out?

22:00.970 --> 22:02.303
I'm afraid she had
a last-minute change of heart.

22:02.371 --> 22:03.438
And why is that?

22:06.676 --> 22:08.143
Abby!

22:13.182 --> 22:15.717
The Caldwell fund-raiser
is tomorrow.

22:15.785 --> 22:17.652
He needs a woman on his arm.
<i>The</i> woman.

22:17.719 --> 22:19.920
You put us completely
back to square one.

22:19.988 --> 22:21.756
I couldn't just let her...

22:21.823 --> 22:23.691
She didn't know what
she was getting into, Liv.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.126
Not every political marriage
ends up with...

22:25.194 --> 22:27.662
Three broken ribs, a busted jaw,
and a restraining order?

22:27.929 --> 22:29.930
I'm sorry.

22:29.998 --> 22:32.232
I look at that family and...

22:32.300 --> 22:34.134
it brings it all back.

22:42.843 --> 22:44.477
If one chat with you
is all it took,

22:44.545 --> 22:46.445
she didn't have the
stomach for it anyway.

22:48.182 --> 22:50.783
(Door opens)

22:50.850 --> 22:52.517
(Clicks switch)

22:56.022 --> 22:58.189
(Door closes)

22:58.256 --> 22:59.757
(Thunderclap)

22:59.825 --> 23:01.159
(Distant thud)

23:01.226 --> 23:03.161
(Screeching sound in distance)

23:04.930 --> 23:06.698
(Buttons clicking)

23:06.765 --> 23:09.366
(Windshield wipers squeaking)

23:09.434 --> 23:12.269
(Breathing heavily)

23:18.275 --> 23:22.045
(Line ringing)

23:22.113 --> 23:25.248
(Ringing and squeaking continue)

23:26.918 --> 23:27.951
Come on, Huck.

23:28.019 --> 23:31.587
(Grunting)

23:31.654 --> 23:33.288
(Muffled shout)

23:33.356 --> 23:35.324
(Gasping)

23:35.391 --> 23:36.792
(Screaming) (Gasps)

23:36.860 --> 23:39.762
(Ringing and squeaking continue)

23:39.830 --> 23:41.764
(Continues grunting)

23:41.832 --> 23:43.966
(Female voice) You have reached
the voice mailbox of...

23:44.034 --> 23:45.399
(Sighs) (Beeps)

23:45.467 --> 23:47.102
(Footsteps approaching)

23:47.169 --> 23:50.004
(Panting)

23:53.075 --> 23:55.877
(Gasps) Please don't hurt me!

23:55.945 --> 23:57.812
I know who killed Wendy.

24:06.287 --> 24:07.655
I'm sorry I followed you.

24:07.723 --> 24:09.823
It's called stalking.
And thank you, by the way,

24:09.891 --> 24:11.858
for putting your phone on
vibrate and taking a nap.

24:11.927 --> 24:14.161
- I don't nap. - Or whatever it is
you did while I was being stalked.

24:14.329 --> 24:15.962
David!
Why were you following him?

24:16.031 --> 24:19.499
I just wanted to talk.
I-I know you didn't kill Wendy.

24:19.566 --> 24:21.700
- How? - Because she said
she really liked him.

24:21.768 --> 24:25.204
Wendy was my best friend.
We told each other everything.

24:25.272 --> 24:27.040
And she knew she had
something really big.

24:27.107 --> 24:28.474
She knew someone wanted
to kill her for it.

24:28.542 --> 24:30.276
- Did she know who?
- There was this guy...

24:30.344 --> 24:31.777
I don't know who it was.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.646
I saw them fighting
outside her house once.

24:33.713 --> 24:35.213
He was threatening her.

24:35.281 --> 24:37.282
He s-said he wanted
whatever she had on him.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.583
That had to be him.

24:38.651 --> 24:41.786
But the thing is,
he knows I know.

24:41.854 --> 24:44.122
He saw me watching,
and now she's dead,

24:44.190 --> 24:47.025
and I'm the only one who
knows who killed her.

24:47.093 --> 24:48.393
Do you think
he'll try and kill me?

24:52.932 --> 24:55.833
Harrison, Abby, keep prepping
Gayle and will for the gala.

24:55.901 --> 24:59.003
Huck, put Molly somewhere safe,
and see if there are any

24:59.071 --> 25:00.471
security cams
outside Wendy's house

25:00.539 --> 25:01.739
that could give us a
visual on this guy.

25:01.807 --> 25:03.575
Maybe we can I.D. him.

25:04.843 --> 25:06.343
What do you think?

25:06.411 --> 25:08.144
Take her to the safe house,
or spring for a room

25:08.212 --> 25:09.746
at the Stanworth?

25:09.814 --> 25:12.415
Uh, do whatever you want.

25:12.483 --> 25:16.219
(Door opens and closes)

25:16.287 --> 25:19.522
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

25:19.591 --> 25:21.424
- She backed out?
- It happens sometimes.

25:21.492 --> 25:22.893
They think they're on
board, and when it's time

25:22.961 --> 25:24.126
to pull the trigger,
they balk.

25:24.194 --> 25:25.494
But we have a very
strong runner-up.

25:25.562 --> 25:26.863
She'll be ready in time
for the fund-raiser.

25:27.130 --> 25:28.365
(Marion) No.
Enough is enough.

25:28.632 --> 25:31.033
- First choice, yes, it's worth
the risk, but... - Marion.

25:31.101 --> 25:32.267
This is Will's wife we're
talking about here.

25:32.335 --> 25:34.137
If he rushes into this
with this woman,

25:34.205 --> 25:36.238
- and then next week decides he
hates her... - He'll get a divorce.

25:36.306 --> 25:38.140
I know you have my best
interests at heart,

25:38.208 --> 25:39.808
but the gala tomorrow night...
That's my shot.

25:39.875 --> 25:41.275
(Cell phone chimes) Those are
the people whose wallets

25:41.343 --> 25:42.844
pick our party's leaders.

25:42.912 --> 25:44.713
This second choice of ours...
She good, Liv?

25:44.780 --> 25:46.615
Because we're gonna need
a real charmer now.

25:46.682 --> 25:48.016
Who does she need to charm?

25:48.083 --> 25:49.651
The President of the United States

25:49.819 --> 25:51.720
just agreed to be our keynote
speaker tomorrow night.

25:51.787 --> 25:53.054
(Exhales)

25:53.122 --> 25:53.989
(Chuckles)

25:56.092 --> 25:58.826
Can't you send someone
else to the Caldwell gala?

25:58.893 --> 26:01.095
Mellie, the Vice President,
Secretary of Agriculture...

26:01.163 --> 26:03.131
- Anyone.
- I didn't even know about it.

26:03.198 --> 26:05.366
I had no idea
he was even going.

26:05.434 --> 26:07.435
- You're kidding me.
- I'm completely out of the loop, Liv.

26:07.503 --> 26:08.802
But it's not the knife
in my back

26:08.870 --> 26:10.404
that is upsetting to me.

26:10.472 --> 26:12.139
It's the size of the knife
in my back.

26:12.206 --> 26:14.608
It's the... enormous knife,

26:14.675 --> 26:18.345
- being stabbed over and over
and over. - Cyrus.

26:18.412 --> 26:19.946
She's got him.
He looks to her.

26:20.014 --> 26:22.815
He leans on her.
He's her guy now.

26:22.883 --> 26:24.618
Maybe that's how it should be.

26:24.685 --> 26:27.920
She's his wife.
She's the mother of his children.

26:27.988 --> 26:30.589
This is Mellie we're talking about.

26:30.657 --> 26:34.059
(Sighs) Whatever you feel about
Fitz, whatever happened,

26:34.127 --> 26:36.595
leaving him to Mellie...
That is low, Liv.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.697
Cyrus.

26:38.765 --> 26:43.035
Yeah, I-I know.
I'm sorry. It's just...

26:43.102 --> 26:45.770
I almost don't know
who I am without him.

26:45.837 --> 26:47.639
It's like...
(Sighs)

26:47.706 --> 26:49.374
I don't know what
to do with my hands,

26:49.441 --> 26:50.941
and she's shoving me
out the door.

26:51.009 --> 26:52.777
I can't figure out
how to fight her.

26:52.844 --> 26:55.713
(Thunder rumbling in distance)

27:00.452 --> 27:02.153
Let Mellie be.

27:04.222 --> 27:05.690
That's how you fight her.

27:05.757 --> 27:07.758
Don't overthink it.
Just let Mellie be.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.794
Let Mellie do what
Mellie's going to do.

27:09.861 --> 27:12.029
When it comes to Fitz,
Mellie's her own worst enemy.

27:12.097 --> 27:14.331
Eventually, she's going to
go too far and cross him.

27:14.399 --> 27:16.033
You just need to be
there when she does.

27:19.303 --> 27:20.970
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>if that doesn't work,</i>

27:21.038 --> 27:24.240
<i>he'll be seeing me</i>
<i>at the fund-raising gala.</i>

27:24.308 --> 27:25.809
<i>Which should take the heat</i>
<i>off you,</i>

27:25.876 --> 27:27.744
<i>because the only person Fitz</i>
<i>hates more than you is me.</i>

27:32.516 --> 27:35.650
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

27:35.719 --> 27:37.319
I was telling her class what
it's like to be a congressman,

27:37.386 --> 27:38.553
but it wasn't going very well.

27:38.621 --> 27:39.955
Honey, they're first-graders.

27:40.023 --> 27:41.656
They have the attention
span of gnats.

27:41.725 --> 27:43.058
Honestly, I couldn't
take my eyes off her.

27:43.126 --> 27:45.527
I was like a blushing schoolboy.
(Laughs)

27:45.595 --> 27:46.795
Don't flinch
when she touches you.

27:46.863 --> 27:48.863
And don't call yourself
"a blushing schoolboy."

27:48.931 --> 27:50.664
In fact, don't ever
say "blushing."

27:50.733 --> 27:52.399
Find a place to disagree
about the story.

27:52.467 --> 27:54.501
Makes you sound less rehearsed.

27:54.569 --> 27:56.170
- Again.
- Again.

27:56.238 --> 27:58.738
First grade teacher
from Nebraska.

27:58.806 --> 28:00.441
What was her
college major again?

28:00.508 --> 28:01.509
Library studies.

28:01.877 --> 28:05.011
Not to mention she's pro-life,
pro-gun, and pro-family.

28:05.079 --> 28:06.246
She wants kids.
(Exhales)

28:06.313 --> 28:07.781
At least four.

28:07.849 --> 28:10.217
And she water-skis...
competitively.

28:10.284 --> 28:13.586
And this was his second choice?
Liv, you have outdone yourself.

28:13.654 --> 28:15.956
Be a hell of a thing if
this marriage became more

28:16.023 --> 28:17.358
than a political convenience,
wouldn't it?

28:17.925 --> 28:20.093
Yeah.
A hell of a thing.

28:24.430 --> 28:25.265
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

28:25.333 --> 28:28.433
These bombing raids are a
death sentence for my son...

28:28.501 --> 28:31.436
(Shutters clicking) And for all
the other hostages of Kashfar.

28:31.504 --> 28:35.474
<i>This President is endangering</i>
<i>my poor Charlie's life.</i>

28:35.541 --> 28:39.710
<i>He is clearly not fit</i>
<i>to be commander-in-chief.</i>

28:39.779 --> 28:41.012
You sure you don't want me
to come with you tonight?

28:41.080 --> 28:42.414
I could dig something up
out of the closet.

28:42.482 --> 28:44.315
It's a bunch of party bigwigs
and oilmen.

28:44.383 --> 28:45.850
You'd be bored to tears.

28:45.918 --> 28:46.985
(Exhales)

28:47.052 --> 28:48.386
(Knocks on door)

28:48.453 --> 28:50.255
Just wanted to remind you,
sir, to pay a little

28:50.322 --> 28:52.890
lip service to the chamber
of commerce guys.

28:52.957 --> 28:55.125
They'll be spending big
come midterms.

28:55.193 --> 28:57.494
Uh-huh.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.329
He's under so much
pressure, Cy.

28:59.397 --> 29:02.132
It's terrible, isn't it?
Approvals are free-falling.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.434
He's coming off as a demon.

29:03.435 --> 29:04.502
I wish there was
something we could do.

29:04.803 --> 29:06.303
It's not like we can
tell the families

29:06.370 --> 29:08.538
that we're back-channeling
with the Kashfaris.

29:08.606 --> 29:10.072
We just have to take
the beating.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.708
Too bad Fitz can't meet
with the families.

29:12.776 --> 29:15.411
(Sighs) Be a media circus.

29:15.478 --> 29:17.013
What if it were me?

29:17.080 --> 29:19.015
You?

29:19.082 --> 29:20.950
I'm good with parents.
I speak their language.

29:20.951 --> 29:21.818
What about the press?

29:21.819 --> 29:23.920
The second these parents
show up at the White House,

29:23.987 --> 29:25.787
we'll lose a week's worth
of news cycles.

29:25.855 --> 29:27.355
So we set up
a conference call...

29:27.423 --> 29:29.090
A private number
the families can dial into.

29:29.158 --> 29:31.526
I say my piece,
I set them at ease...

29:31.593 --> 29:33.561
Disaster averted.

29:33.629 --> 29:35.496
<i>(Woman speaking</i>
<i>indistinctly on tv)</i>

29:35.564 --> 29:37.632
What would this White House
do without you, Mellie?

29:37.700 --> 29:39.234
(Exhales)

29:41.803 --> 29:43.403
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

29:43.471 --> 29:45.439
(Sighs)

29:47.775 --> 29:49.443
(Sighs)

29:51.947 --> 29:54.014
(Cell phone chimes)

29:54.082 --> 29:55.983
(Chimes and beeps)
I have a car waiting.

29:56.051 --> 29:57.884
- One of the girls talked.
- What? To who?

29:57.952 --> 29:59.285
Editor of the "D. C. Dish."

29:59.353 --> 30:00.586
He just called asking me
to comment on the auditions

30:00.654 --> 30:02.488
we held to find a fake
wife for, and I quote,

30:02.556 --> 30:03.756
"Senator Caldwell's
gay brother."

30:03.824 --> 30:05.524
- How much does he know?
- Everything,

30:05.592 --> 30:07.760
from rehearsals
to confidentiality agreements.

30:07.828 --> 30:09.995
(Exhales) Find out how much
lead time we have.

30:10.063 --> 30:11.464
None. They're running the story
tomorrow morning.

30:11.531 --> 30:12.732
(Exhales)

30:12.799 --> 30:13.932
(Clicks switch)

30:14.000 --> 30:15.401
This story cannot come out.

30:15.469 --> 30:16.969
It'll destroy
Will's political career.

30:17.036 --> 30:18.236
I'm headed to the "D.C. Dish" now.

30:18.304 --> 30:20.205
I bet it's the first girl who
leaked it...the one Abby got to.

30:20.273 --> 30:21.773
We deal with that later.
Just do whatever...

30:22.140 --> 30:24.376
And, Harrison, I mean
<i>whatever</i> we need to do

30:24.443 --> 30:26.411
to shut this down!

30:33.564 --> 30:34.831
Hey, Anne.

30:34.899 --> 30:36.933
I'm on deadline, Cy.
Come back in an hour.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.802
I've got a big story for you.
Biggest of the week.

30:39.869 --> 30:41.904
An American civilian
was beheaded in Kashfar,

30:41.971 --> 30:44.072
and in return you guys
ignored international law

30:44.140 --> 30:45.707
and bombed half a dozen villages.

30:45.775 --> 30:48.510
News-wise, I'd say it's already
been a pretty big week.

30:48.578 --> 30:50.312
8:00 tomorrow morning,
the First Lady will be

30:50.379 --> 30:52.280
on a conference call,
a conference call where

30:52.348 --> 30:55.182
she will speak very freely
about what this administration

30:55.250 --> 30:57.117
is doing regarding the hostages.

30:57.185 --> 30:59.954
She will speak freely because
she won't, in fact, know

31:00.021 --> 31:01.088
that a reporter,
hopefully yourself,

31:01.156 --> 31:02.122
will be on the line.

31:02.190 --> 31:03.858
(Paper rustles)
(Clicks tongue)

31:03.926 --> 31:05.593
Have I mentioned how much
I like and respect you, Cy?

31:05.661 --> 31:07.127
<i>Anne.</i>
You're welcome.

31:07.195 --> 31:08.063
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

31:08.130 --> 31:10.264
The house across the street
from Wendy's had a security cam.

31:10.331 --> 31:12.433
- Mm-hmm.
- And look, right there...See that?

31:15.035 --> 31:16.369
Mm-hmm.

31:16.437 --> 31:18.404
Same night Molly saw Wendy
fight with our mystery guy,

31:18.473 --> 31:19.940
and the time fits, too.

31:20.007 --> 31:21.407
We should have Molly
come in and take a look,

31:21.476 --> 31:22.843
- see if she can I.D. him.
- I'll call right now.

31:22.910 --> 31:24.478
(Gasps)

31:24.545 --> 31:25.412
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

31:25.780 --> 31:27.480
We're running this.
End of story.

31:27.547 --> 31:29.047
- Off of one source?
- Look around you.

31:29.115 --> 31:30.483
This is the "Dish,"
not the "Times."

31:30.550 --> 31:31.484
I ain't Bernstein,

31:31.552 --> 31:33.185
and my reporter sure as
hell ain't Woodward.

31:33.253 --> 31:34.587
I get it.
You break this story...

31:34.754 --> 31:36.088
However erroneous
and fabricated... and what?

31:36.155 --> 31:37.389
Sell out a day's worth
of papers,

31:37.457 --> 31:38.624
score a few hundred
thousand clicks?

31:38.692 --> 31:40.859
Let me just ask you... would you
rather break this story,

31:41.127 --> 31:42.827
or would you rather
own this story?

31:42.895 --> 31:44.428
What's your offer?

31:44.497 --> 31:45.997
(Chuckles)

31:46.064 --> 31:47.499
(Indistinct conversations)

31:47.566 --> 31:49.501
She was so pretty, I-I still
don't know how I made it

31:49.568 --> 31:50.969
through "Green Eggs and Ham."
(Laughs)

31:51.036 --> 31:53.705
Keep in mind, there's only about
five words on each page.

31:53.772 --> 31:56.874
(Laughter)
Thank you so much.

31:56.942 --> 31:57.842
(Amplified voice)
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:57.910 --> 32:00.544
the President of the United States.

32:00.612 --> 32:03.246
(Applause)

32:29.006 --> 32:31.706
(Panting and rustling)

32:31.774 --> 32:33.008
(Moans)

32:33.075 --> 32:36.778
(Laughs and sighs)

32:38.581 --> 32:40.214
Don't think this means anything.

32:40.282 --> 32:41.783
(Exhales)

32:41.851 --> 32:44.519
Don't worry!
I don't!

32:47.022 --> 32:48.589
When it comes to leadership,

32:48.657 --> 32:50.457
there's no better man
than Will Caldwell.

32:50.525 --> 32:52.059
(Applause)

32:52.126 --> 32:53.527
I mean that.

32:53.595 --> 32:55.963
Support him, and not only
does North Carolina

32:56.031 --> 32:58.131
get a damn good Governor,
but he'll be too busy

32:58.199 --> 32:59.700
to run against me
in the primaries.

32:59.768 --> 33:02.469
(Laughter)
(Chuckles) Thank you.

33:02.537 --> 33:03.670
Thanks, everyone.

33:03.737 --> 33:05.038
(Applause) Thank you.

33:05.105 --> 33:06.673
Will Caldwell, Governor.

33:10.210 --> 33:12.812
(Speaks inaudibly)

33:12.880 --> 33:14.647
(Cell phone chimes)

33:14.715 --> 33:15.949
(Chimes)

33:16.016 --> 33:17.349
Harrison.

33:17.417 --> 33:19.184
Well, now I know why you
won't go out with me again.

33:19.251 --> 33:20.619
You're having a torrid affair
with Henderson.

33:20.687 --> 33:22.287
It's Harrison,
and he's my coworker.

33:22.354 --> 33:23.421
Why are you calling?

33:23.489 --> 33:24.690
Uh, you called me.

33:24.757 --> 33:26.892
- No... (Laughs) I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.427
You said, "Jake, if I'm gonna
go on a second date with you,

33:29.495 --> 33:30.696
I'm gonna need you
to sell me."

33:30.763 --> 33:32.097
You don't remember saying that?

33:32.164 --> 33:35.332
No.
So sell me.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.568
Let me guess. We'll start
at a Michelin-rated restaurant

33:37.636 --> 33:39.203
and end up picnicking
under a bridge.

33:47.779 --> 33:49.480
No, I was thinking the Metro.

33:49.547 --> 33:51.081
Slap some Mac and cheese
in a tupperware.

33:51.148 --> 33:52.983
The Red Line's my favorite,
but it's also the longest,

33:53.050 --> 33:55.418
so until I'm sure
that I like you,

33:55.486 --> 33:56.820
you know,
as much as you like me,

33:56.887 --> 33:58.554
I think it's best we start
with something short,

33:58.623 --> 33:59.823
like the Green Line.

33:59.890 --> 34:01.858
(Call waiting beep)

34:01.926 --> 34:04.260
I have to go, Jake. I'm sorry.
Can I call you back tomorrow?

34:04.328 --> 34:05.729
And say hi to Henderson for me.

34:05.796 --> 34:07.262
(Laughs) (Button clicks)

34:07.330 --> 34:08.697
Tell me you shut it down.

34:08.764 --> 34:11.466
I shut it down.
It took me offering exclusivity

34:11.534 --> 34:13.534
on the Caldwell wedding photos
and pretty much everything else

34:13.603 --> 34:15.070
for the rest of their
heavily contracted marriage,

34:15.138 --> 34:16.839
- but given what's at stake...
- Small price to pay.

34:16.906 --> 34:18.306
So where are we
with the first girl?

34:18.373 --> 34:20.074
- You think we can muzzle her?
- That's the thing.

34:20.143 --> 34:21.476
I was talking to the
editor, and he said

34:21.543 --> 34:22.777
the leak came
from inside the family.

34:24.679 --> 34:25.679
(Clicks phone)

34:25.748 --> 34:28.783
Hello?
Liv?

34:28.851 --> 34:29.952
<i>(Peter) He needs a wife.</i>

34:30.018 --> 34:32.221
<i>(Olivia) You haven't dated</i>
<i>anyone in the last ten years.</i>

34:32.288 --> 34:35.524
<i>- Why?</i><i>- I'm sowing my oats.</i>
<i>I don't want to settle down.</i>

34:35.591 --> 34:37.192
<i>This is Will's wife</i>
<i>we're talking about here.</i>

34:37.260 --> 34:38.726
<i>If he rushes into this</i>
<i>with this woman</i>

34:38.793 --> 34:40.460
<i>and then next week</i>
<i>decides he hates her...</i>

34:40.529 --> 34:42.129
(Door clicks)

34:42.197 --> 34:44.063
<i>Be a hell of a thing</i>
<i>if this marriage became more</i>

34:44.132 --> 34:46.367
<i>than a political convenience,</i>
<i>wouldn't it?</i>

34:46.434 --> 34:48.268
<i>Yeah. A hell of a thing.</i>

34:48.335 --> 34:49.969
<i>(Echoes) A hell of a thing.</i>

34:50.038 --> 34:51.572
<i>(Harrison) He said the leak</i>
<i>came from inside the family.</i>

34:57.344 --> 34:59.078
I can't.

34:59.146 --> 35:00.346
(Panting)

35:00.414 --> 35:01.614
I have to go.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.783
Marion...

35:17.197 --> 35:19.464
- Olivia.
- Will.

35:19.532 --> 35:21.366
End it.
Now.

35:21.434 --> 35:23.402
I don't know
what you're talking...

35:23.469 --> 35:24.903
I saw you.
End it.

35:24.970 --> 35:27.105
I don't care how much
we're paying you.

35:27.173 --> 35:29.240
You have no right
to insert yourself

35:29.308 --> 35:31.442
into a private family...

35:32.977 --> 35:35.746
I can't.
It's too late.

35:35.814 --> 35:36.914
Why?

35:36.981 --> 35:38.182
Because I love her.

35:38.250 --> 35:40.751
The day Pete brought her
home ten years ago,

35:40.819 --> 35:42.553
I wasn't even supposed
to be there.

35:42.621 --> 35:44.887
I was supposed to be
on a plane.

35:44.955 --> 35:47.924
Sometimes I wonder, if I had
just been somewhere else...

35:47.991 --> 35:51.528
We denied it for months,
because that's what you do.

35:51.596 --> 35:54.030
You deny it. You pretend
it's not happening.

35:54.098 --> 35:57.000
You pretend it's all above board
and it's appropriate,

35:57.068 --> 35:58.835
and the next thing you know,
you're having sex

35:58.903 --> 36:01.003
in the coat closet at your
brother's engagement dinner.

36:03.506 --> 36:05.006
Pete loves her.
She's his wife.

36:05.074 --> 36:07.209
And she and I...

36:07.277 --> 36:09.878
Well, we have what we have.
It might not be much,

36:09.946 --> 36:11.547
but it's what we have.

36:13.283 --> 36:15.583
You have nothing.

36:15.651 --> 36:18.486
You have a pile
of secrets and lies,

36:18.554 --> 36:20.020
and you're calling it love.

36:20.088 --> 36:22.223
And in the meantime,
you're letting your whole life

36:22.291 --> 36:24.292
pass you by
while they raise children

36:24.360 --> 36:25.893
and celebrate anniversaries

36:25.961 --> 36:27.528
and grow old together.

36:27.596 --> 36:29.063
You're frozen in time.

36:29.131 --> 36:31.132
You're holding your breath.
You're a statue

36:31.199 --> 36:34.968
waiting for something
that's never going to happen.

36:35.035 --> 36:37.738
Living for stolen moments
in hotel hallways

36:37.805 --> 36:39.839
and coat closets,
you keep telling yourself

36:39.907 --> 36:41.508
they all add up
to something real,

36:41.576 --> 36:43.143
because in your mind
they have to, but they don't.

36:43.311 --> 36:45.245
They won't.
They never will.

36:45.313 --> 36:47.480
(Voice breaking) Because
stolen moments aren't a life.

36:47.547 --> 36:50.082
So you have nothing.

36:50.150 --> 36:52.251
You have no one.
End it now.

37:04.643 --> 37:05.677
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

37:05.744 --> 37:07.912
(Thunderclap, rain falling)

37:07.979 --> 37:10.047
(Footsteps approaching)

37:12.184 --> 37:14.952
(Sighs) Um...

37:15.020 --> 37:16.854
(Sets cup on table) I've got Molly
set up in the conference room

37:16.922 --> 37:18.255
looking at the images
of the guy you found

37:18.324 --> 37:19.856
on the security cam
from Wendy's house.

37:19.924 --> 37:21.725
Fingers crossed
she can I.D. the guy.

37:21.793 --> 37:23.427
Uh, yeah.

37:28.065 --> 37:29.366
You smell.

37:29.434 --> 37:30.667
What?

37:30.735 --> 37:32.101
You smell, Huck.

37:32.169 --> 37:33.804
You've smelled for a week.

37:35.406 --> 37:37.006
(Inhales sharply)

37:37.074 --> 37:38.574
I googled it.

37:38.642 --> 37:41.044
What happens to people
who've been waterboarded.

37:41.111 --> 37:43.046
They get panic attacks.
They can't sleep.

37:43.113 --> 37:45.982
Some of them can't even
go out in the rain.

37:46.050 --> 37:48.151
(Labored breathing) Sometimes
the rain makes things so bad,

37:48.219 --> 37:50.153
they can't even face the shower.

37:51.688 --> 37:52.921
Huck?

37:52.989 --> 37:55.457
It'll go away.

37:55.524 --> 37:57.059
When the rain stops,
it'll go away,

37:57.126 --> 37:58.393
and I'll be fine.

37:58.461 --> 38:00.495
Being okay as long as
it doesn't rain

38:00.563 --> 38:01.997
isn't the same as being fine.

38:02.065 --> 38:04.632
I used to live in a box
outside the Metro,

38:04.700 --> 38:07.836
and before that I dismembered
people for a living.

38:07.903 --> 38:09.603
Right now I smell.

38:09.671 --> 38:11.505
When the rain stops,
I won't smell.

38:11.573 --> 38:13.140
I'm fine.

38:17.612 --> 38:19.313
(Beep)

38:19.381 --> 38:21.815
- Is that...
- One of Wendy's files.

38:23.252 --> 38:24.851
(Huck taps key)

38:24.919 --> 38:26.786
(Door opens and closes)

38:26.854 --> 38:29.022
How exciting to be summoned.

38:29.090 --> 38:30.658
Speaking
to the hostages' families,

38:30.725 --> 38:33.260
- making promises in my name?
- In the first lady's defense, sir,

38:33.327 --> 38:34.394
her heart was
in the right place.

38:34.461 --> 38:35.795
It's where her head was lodged.

38:35.863 --> 38:37.597
I was only trying to help
behind the scenes.

38:37.664 --> 38:39.032
There was a reporter
on the call.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.432
It's all over the news.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.666
What?

38:41.734 --> 38:43.602
There wasn't supposed
to be press.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.204
Oh, there wasn't supposed
to be any witnesses

38:45.272 --> 38:48.374
to your discussing
military options with civilians,

38:48.441 --> 38:51.210
or implying we're willing
to negotiate with terrorists,

38:51.278 --> 38:53.845
jeopardizing every
U.S. citizen overseas.

38:53.914 --> 38:56.580
That was just an "oops"?
Fine!

38:56.648 --> 38:58.082
I feel so much better.

38:58.150 --> 38:59.650
(Inhales) What can I do, sir?

38:59.718 --> 39:01.052
You've done enough, Cy.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.954
Arrange a press conference...
C.I.A.,

39:03.022 --> 39:04.789
National Security,
and Secretary of State.

39:04.856 --> 39:07.625
Good. Smart. We'll act fast,
put a band-aid on it.

39:07.692 --> 39:08.726
Fitz...

39:08.794 --> 39:09.928
That'll be all.

39:11.130 --> 39:12.029
(Exhales)

39:14.565 --> 39:16.166
<i>Representative Caldwell</i>
<i>might have thought</i>

39:16.234 --> 39:18.101
<i>he'd be the one</i>
<i>making headlines,</i>

39:18.169 --> 39:20.470
<i>with a big endorsement</i>
<i>from president grant,</i>

39:20.538 --> 39:23.206
<i>but never underestimate</i>
<i>America's love</i>

39:23.274 --> 39:24.841
<i>of a Cinderella story.</i>

39:24.909 --> 39:27.144
<i>Stealing the spotlight</i>
<i>was Caldwell's date</i>

39:27.211 --> 39:29.478
<i>to the gala affair,</i>
<i>an elementary school...</i>(Turns off tv)

39:29.546 --> 39:31.013
(Sighs)

39:31.081 --> 39:34.850
(Cell phone rings and beeps)

39:34.918 --> 39:36.118
Hey there, you.

39:38.088 --> 39:39.121
Yes.

39:39.189 --> 39:40.489
Yes?

39:40.557 --> 39:41.790
Yes, I will go out with you.

39:41.858 --> 39:43.459
Henderson's out of the picture?

39:43.526 --> 39:45.560
(Chuckling) Henderson's
out of the picture.

39:47.029 --> 39:48.830
I've got a client.
Call me later.

39:52.801 --> 39:54.769
Job well done, as usual.

39:54.837 --> 39:56.838
Looks like your brother
might actually win this thing.

39:56.905 --> 39:59.474
Oh, he's got a great shot.
Gayle on his arm

39:59.541 --> 40:01.808
and the President
in his corner.

40:01.876 --> 40:03.444
Money is flowing in
by the barrel.

40:03.511 --> 40:05.045
All we have to do is keep
chip out of rehab.

40:05.113 --> 40:06.480
I say the Caldwells are golden.

40:06.547 --> 40:08.748
It'll be nice to have
your little brother

40:08.816 --> 40:10.417
in the Governor's mansion.

40:10.485 --> 40:12.152
(Clicks tongue) Yeah.

40:12.220 --> 40:13.720
Be nice to have
my wife back, too.

40:16.090 --> 40:17.423
Come on, Liv.

40:17.491 --> 40:19.558
I grew up in America's
greatest political family.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.194
We lie first, breed second.

40:21.261 --> 40:22.728
They've been sleeping
together for years.

40:22.796 --> 40:25.664
Saw it from a mile away.

40:25.732 --> 40:28.167
If you knew,
why didn't you stop it?

40:28.235 --> 40:29.735
Because my brother's
crazy enough

40:29.803 --> 40:31.304
to try and fight me for her.

40:31.372 --> 40:32.971
He'd tank his whole career
for Marion.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.639
I couldn't let that happen.

40:34.707 --> 40:36.041
Family comes first.
Always has.

40:38.644 --> 40:41.046
That's the downside
of being a Caldwell.

40:48.286 --> 40:49.353
What is it?

40:55.827 --> 40:57.594
These are the hostages.

40:57.662 --> 40:59.263
Their C.I.A. files were
on Wendy's flash drive.

40:59.331 --> 41:00.664
Huck just de-encrypted them.

41:00.732 --> 41:03.000
So albatross, the mole,
the man who killed Wendy...

41:03.068 --> 41:05.968
He's the one who leaked
their names to the terrorists.

41:06.037 --> 41:08.604
I went in house, I did a thorough
sweep of all my officers,

41:08.672 --> 41:10.206
checked all ingoing,
outgoing communications.

41:10.274 --> 41:11.408
And?

41:11.475 --> 41:12.975
The mole is not in the agency.

41:13.044 --> 41:14.210
The C.I.A. is clean on this, sir.

41:14.278 --> 41:15.912
Which is a relief.

41:15.979 --> 41:17.980
However, it does not
solve our problem.

41:18.049 --> 41:20.382
I know the picture's not great,
but you think that's the guy?

41:20.450 --> 41:22.384
- That's him.
- It is?

41:22.452 --> 41:25.220
That's him. That's the guy.
I know it. That's him.

41:25.288 --> 41:27.322
(Panting) Olivia!

41:27.390 --> 41:29.425
Sir, for my money,
I'd start looking into

41:29.492 --> 41:31.193
other intelligence avenues...

41:31.261 --> 41:33.162
The N.S.A.,
National Security Council.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.630
I can provide you
with reliable names,

41:35.698 --> 41:37.098
oversee any sweeps you need.

41:37.166 --> 41:38.766
That's the guy who wanted
what Wendy stole!

41:38.833 --> 41:40.968
That's the guy who killed her!
That's him on the tv!

41:41.036 --> 41:42.836
That is him!

41:44.973 --> 41:49.110
(Speaking inaudibly)

41:49.178 --> 41:50.411
Thank you, Osborne.

41:50.479 --> 41:52.912
Happy to be of service,
Mr. President.

42:03.791 --> 42:06.159
(Knock on door, door opens)

42:06.227 --> 42:08.427
- Sir?
- Send him in.

42:09.463 --> 42:10.463
(Bottle clatters)

42:12.566 --> 42:14.300
I don't see you in person
for three years,

42:14.367 --> 42:15.634
and now I'm seeing you
twice in a week?

42:15.702 --> 42:16.735
I'm starting to feel special.
(Door closes)

42:16.803 --> 42:18.104
- You still watching her?
- Of course.

42:18.171 --> 42:19.705
But I have to tell you,
I don't have any more

42:19.772 --> 42:21.773
- information than I gave you
the other day. - Who's the guy?

42:21.841 --> 42:23.709
What?
There's a guy, isn't there?

42:23.776 --> 42:25.510
- She's seeing someone, someone new.
- Look...

42:25.578 --> 42:26.978
Who's the guy?

42:27.045 --> 42:28.513
So this is personal.
Look, Fitz...

42:28.581 --> 42:30.749
I'm your commander-in-chief.
It's "Mr. President,"

42:30.750 --> 42:31.949
and I need an answer.

42:37.022 --> 42:41.024
Mr. President,
there is no guy.

42:41.092 --> 42:42.292
She's not seeing anyone.

42:46.764 --> 42:49.533

shutter clicking)
