AWARD FROM
THE CITY OF VENICE 1966

01:23.644 --> 01:26.980
Couldn't you have talked sooner?

01:27.606 --> 01:29.649
It would've gone easier for you.

01:41.162 --> 01:43.329
He finally came clean.

01:44.331 --> 01:46.124
Give him some coffee.

01:48.335 --> 01:50.003
Don't worry.

01:50.463 --> 01:52.756
Drink this.
You'll feel better.

01:57.636 --> 01:59.763
Don't take it so hard, fella.

02:11.275 --> 02:12.525
At ease.

02:12.693 --> 02:15.695
Is it true?
- Looks like it. 3 rue des Abderames.

02:15.946 --> 02:17.155
Get him dressed.

02:19.366 --> 02:20.784
Buck up.

02:20.951 --> 02:24.204
It's all over now.
Just one last little effort.

02:24.538 --> 02:26.581
Can you stand?

02:26.832 --> 02:28.166
Let go of him.

02:30.169 --> 02:32.170
Here, put this on.

02:37.468 --> 02:39.385
It'll suit you fine.

02:40.554 --> 02:45.141
We're going to the Casbah now.
They won't recognize you in that.

02:45.309 --> 02:47.560
Show us Ali La Pointe's hideout.

02:48.020 --> 02:49.687
Then you'll be free.

02:50.356 --> 02:52.232
Give him a cap and dress him.

02:52.858 --> 02:54.067
You're inducted!

02:54.443 --> 02:55.860
Cut the clowning, Lagloy!

03:03.577 --> 03:05.078
Let's go.

03:13.337 --> 03:16.798
Knock it off!
Wanna go through another round?

03:17.007 --> 03:20.343
Quit fooling around.
Pull yourself together.

03:25.474 --> 03:31.271
THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS

06:11.598 --> 06:13.975
Maybe they don't know we're here.

06:22.651 --> 06:27.155
Ali La Pointe, the house
is surrounded. It's useless.

06:28.907 --> 06:32.660
Give yourselves up.
Let the boy and the woman out first.

06:32.870 --> 06:36.289
Then the other man with you.
After that, you come out.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.292
Leave your weapons behind.

06:40.627 --> 06:42.712
No tricks. You're done for.

06:43.130 --> 06:47.800
We have you covered.
You don't have a chance. Got that?

06:49.970 --> 06:51.471
You hear me, Ali?

06:53.307 --> 06:57.935
Listen good! You're the last one.
It's all over.

06:58.145 --> 06:59.937
The organization's finished.

07:00.481 --> 07:02.815
Everyone's dead or in prison.

07:03.484 --> 07:06.152
If you come out now,
you'll get a fair trial.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.488
Make up your mind!

<i>To avoid bloodshed, we propose
that the French authorities</i>

08:05.045 --> 08:09.257
<i>negotiate with us
our right to self-determination.</i>

08:10.134 --> 08:14.220

your country and restore its liberty.</i>

<i>Forward, brothers! Unite!
The FLN calls you to arms.</i>

08:21.728 --> 08:24.522
Ladies and gents, place your bets.

08:24.898 --> 08:26.941
This loses, this loses...

08:27.860 --> 08:30.069
Ace wins.

08:32.905 --> 08:33.905
500 francs.

08:36.952 --> 08:38.619
Your turn, madam.

08:44.208 --> 08:47.128
Ace wins, this one loses.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.047
He's always there!

09:01.852 --> 09:04.187
- What's his big hurry?
- Stop him.

09:17.534 --> 09:19.660
Bash the bastard's head in!

09:32.758 --> 09:34.091
<i>Omar, Ali.</i>

09:34.551 --> 09:37.887

11:25.787 --> 11:32.293
Long live Algeria!

11:51.438 --> 11:53.230
Shut up! There he is.

11:54.274 --> 11:55.733
Keep quiet.

12:52.040 --> 12:55.835
FIVE MONTHS LATER

13:40.797 --> 13:42.047
Beat it!

13:42.215 --> 13:45.259
"Men have two faces.
One smiles, the other cries."

13:45.469 --> 13:46.594
They sent you?

13:46.803 --> 13:47.887
Yes, they sent me.

13:48.555 --> 13:49.263
Here.

13:50.849 --> 13:52.224
Wait!

13:52.726 --> 13:54.143
Come back here.

13:56.188 --> 13:57.563
Know how to read?
- Sure.

13:57.731 --> 13:59.565
Read it to me.

14:03.695 --> 14:07.490
"There's a Moorish café
on rue Randon, in the Casbah.

14:07.699 --> 14:12.161
Merabi, the owner,
is a police informer.

14:12.454 --> 14:16.999
Every afternoon at 5:00,
a French policeman stops by.

14:17.459 --> 14:23.756
<i>He stays a few minutes, long enough
to drink a coffee and get information.</i>

14:23.965 --> 14:27.510
<i>Then he leaves.
You are to kill the policeman."</i>

14:27.719 --> 14:30.721
<i>- Not Merabi?
- No, the policeman.</i>

14:31.181 --> 14:32.223
<i>Okay.</i>

14:33.225 --> 14:35.017
<i>"You can't go wrong.</i>

14:35.727 --> 14:41.106
<i>Right next to the café
you'll see a girl with a basket.</i>

14:41.566 --> 14:43.943
<i>You'll both follow the policeman.</i>

14:44.110 --> 14:48.447
<i>At the right moment,
she'll hand you a revolver.</i>

14:48.698 --> 14:51.450
<i>You just have to pull the trigger."</i>

15:14.224 --> 15:15.558
Let go of me!

15:15.725 --> 15:17.142
Watch me, brothers!

15:18.812 --> 15:21.146
So, you're afraid now!

15:21.356 --> 15:25.234
Look how the organization
deals with traitors.

15:50.927 --> 15:54.680
- You bitch! You set me up.
- Careful, the police!

15:58.893 --> 16:02.938
- Now explain!
- If they don't catch us first.

16:03.148 --> 16:05.608
Who sent you?
Take me to him.

16:05.817 --> 16:07.401
- He's waiting.
- Where?

16:07.569 --> 16:10.446
You'll see, if we don't get caught.

16:27.589 --> 16:30.466
You go first.
I'll be right behind you.

16:35.847 --> 16:38.557
What if you were a traitor?
We had to be sure.

16:38.725 --> 16:43.437
- The gun was empty.
- Say you'd been a police spy,

16:43.688 --> 16:48.567
the FLN contacts you in prison,
you pretend to be for the cause,

16:48.777 --> 16:50.653
and the French let you escape.

16:50.987 --> 16:52.237
Then they shoot me?

16:52.364 --> 16:54.073
Blanks.

16:54.240 --> 16:58.160
You escape, go to the address
the FLN gives you in prison,

16:58.328 --> 17:00.204
and infiltrate us.

17:00.330 --> 17:01.622
And who are you?

17:01.790 --> 17:04.916
Jaffar. El-hadi Jaffar.

17:05.752 --> 17:09.421
To join us you had to do a job.

17:09.714 --> 17:12.925
If I'd told you to kill
the bar owner, an Algerian,

17:13.134 --> 17:18.931
the cops would've let you kill him
even though he's a stoolie.

17:19.140 --> 17:21.474
It wouldn't have proved your loyalty.

17:22.352 --> 17:24.645
If I told you to kill the cop,

17:25.480 --> 17:28.107
the French
would never have allowed it.

17:28.316 --> 17:32.152
If you had been one of them,
you wouldn't have done it.

17:32.946 --> 17:34.446
But I didn't kill him.

17:34.948 --> 17:39.243
No, but you tried.
That's the important thing.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.286
You didn't trust me!

17:41.955 --> 17:43.831
Come on, don't get excited.

17:44.290 --> 17:47.793
I said to shoot him in the back.

17:48.044 --> 17:49.128
No way!

17:50.088 --> 17:51.922
You still don't understand.

17:52.632 --> 17:55.509
Explain it better.

17:55.635 --> 17:57.636
Okay, I'll explain.

17:58.805 --> 18:01.724
First, we need to get organized

18:01.975 --> 18:04.059
and secure our hideouts.

18:04.978 --> 18:07.020
Then we can take action.

18:07.355 --> 18:09.148
The organization's getting stronger,

18:09.274 --> 18:14.903
but there are still too many
drunks, whores, junkies,

18:15.488 --> 18:19.116
people who talk too much,
people ready to sell us out.

18:19.409 --> 18:22.077
We must win them over
or eliminate them.

18:22.287 --> 18:26.457
We need to clean house first,
organize the country.

18:26.666 --> 18:30.586
Only then can we take on
our real enemy. You understand, Ali?

18:31.337 --> 18:33.505
APRIL 1956

18:33.590 --> 18:35.674
National Liberation Front,

18:35.967 --> 18:37.634
<i>Communiqué No. 24:</i>

18:37.844 --> 18:40.971
<i>People of Algeria,
the Colonial Administration</i>

18:41.181 --> 18:45.267
<i>is responsible not only
for impoverishing our people</i>

18:45.477 --> 18:50.522
<i>but also for corrupting and degrading
our brothers and sisters,</i>

18:50.690 --> 18:53.358
<i>who have lost their sense of dignity.</i>

18:53.568 --> 18:56.987
<i>The FLN is leading a campaign
to eradicate this scourge</i>

18:57.155 --> 19:00.449
<i>and requests the population's help
and cooperation.</i>

19:00.617 --> 19:04.495
<i>This is the first step
towards independence.</i>

19:07.248 --> 19:12.127
<i>As of today, the FLN
assumes responsibility</i>

19:12.462 --> 19:14.963
<i>for the physical and moral well-being
of the Algerian people</i>

19:15.048 --> 19:16.381
<i>and has therefore decided</i>

19:16.591 --> 19:21.386
<i>to ban the sale and use
of all drugs and alcoholic beverages</i>

19:21.596 --> 19:24.681
<i>and to ban
prostitution and procuring.</i>

19:24.891 --> 19:29.812
<i>Offenders will be punished. Repeat
offenders will be sentenced to death.</i>

19:30.480 --> 19:32.231
Wino! Wino!

20:27.954 --> 20:30.455
Don't you know
drugs are forbidden?

20:31.666 --> 20:33.500
- Why?
- Don't do it again.

20:33.793 --> 20:35.377
Have you seen Hassan El-Blidi?

20:44.137 --> 20:47.639
You seen Hassan El-Blidi?
Tell him I'm looking for him.

20:52.478 --> 20:53.520
Seen Hassan?

20:59.819 --> 21:03.530
If you see Hassan El-Blidi,
tell him I'm looking for him.

21:06.993 --> 21:08.869
Ali, where've you been?

21:09.078 --> 21:13.081
- Is Hassan here?
- He left very early. Need something?

21:13.249 --> 21:16.251
If you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

21:23.217 --> 21:24.885
Ali! How're you doing?

21:25.094 --> 21:28.180
Stay there. Don't move.

21:28.473 --> 21:30.974
- Take it easy.
- I told you not to move.

21:31.434 --> 21:33.518
What are you afraid of?

21:33.603 --> 21:34.895
I fear only God.

21:35.647 --> 21:37.564
What's all this about?

21:38.775 --> 21:40.359
There's nothing between us.

21:40.693 --> 21:43.362
We're friends.
Have you forgotten?

21:44.280 --> 21:45.030
We were friends.

21:45.531 --> 21:47.449
What's happened to you?

21:47.617 --> 21:48.909
You're sentenced to death.

21:52.205 --> 21:55.374
Now I understand.

21:55.917 --> 21:57.834
You've sentenced me to death.

22:02.173 --> 22:03.632
What are they paying you?

22:03.800 --> 22:05.550
Only one thing can save you.

22:05.718 --> 22:08.720
You've been warned twice.
This is your last warning.

22:09.722 --> 22:12.140
What do you mean?

22:12.600 --> 22:14.267
Work for the FLN.

22:14.727 --> 22:16.228
Get lost!

22:19.190 --> 22:24.486
Don't try it! Take a good look.
Things will change in the Casbah.

22:24.696 --> 22:27.364
Take a good look.
We'll clean this place up.

22:27.573 --> 22:29.366
Now beat it!

22:32.245 --> 22:34.037
And watch yourselves.

22:34.914 --> 22:39.584
JUNE 10, 1956

22:47.260 --> 22:49.344
Stay outside and keep watch.

22:55.727 --> 22:58.186
Everything all right?
- Fine.

23:02.608 --> 23:03.939
Be seated.

23:11.784 --> 23:13.491
Be seated.

23:17.623 --> 23:21.168
We'll skip the formalities.
You know why.

23:22.628 --> 23:26.965
The day will come when we will have
our weddings in the open.

23:27.133 --> 23:30.093
Remember, we are at war
against colonialism.

23:30.344 --> 23:35.474
A strong army has occupied
our country for 130 years.

23:37.101 --> 23:41.855
<i>This is why the FLN
has to make decisions</i>

23:42.065 --> 23:45.859
<i>concerning the civil life
of the Algerian people.</i>

23:46.986 --> 23:50.822
<i>With this marriage
we fulfill our duty,</i>

23:50.990 --> 23:52.949
<i>a duty of resistance.</i>

24:02.168 --> 24:06.088
And now,
Mahmud and Fatiha,

24:06.339 --> 24:08.006
come forward.

24:15.681 --> 24:16.848
Sign here.

24:19.185 --> 24:22.145
May God grant you good fortune.
Sign here.

24:28.361 --> 24:31.947
On behalf of the FLN,
my sincerest congratulations.

24:32.156 --> 24:33.949
Make yourselves comfortable.

25:14.740 --> 25:20.328
JUNE 20, 1956 - 10:32 A.M.

25:59.285 --> 26:00.285
Come here!

26:02.288 --> 26:05.123
What is it? Calm down.

26:05.499 --> 26:07.083
Come in here.

26:07.835 --> 26:09.127
Hey, Antoine...

26:11.214 --> 26:13.882
Take them in to see the captain.

27:27.206 --> 27:31.376
<i>Yes, sir, but they didn't get
a search warrant.</i>

27:32.169 --> 27:34.045
Rue d'Isly?

27:34.213 --> 27:38.550
They followed them some distance
but then lost them.

27:39.719 --> 27:44.180
Of course, sir,
but that's in your precinct.

27:46.058 --> 27:47.809
It's not their job.

27:47.935 --> 27:50.895
Rue Marengo?
We do have some suspects.

27:52.523 --> 27:55.483
The DA first demands
an official request.

27:55.609 --> 27:57.694
Yes, sir.

27:59.363 --> 28:01.531
But I don't have enough men.

28:01.741 --> 28:03.033
I understand.

28:03.701 --> 28:05.702
But if you could...

28:06.412 --> 28:08.204
The prefect can't.

28:08.414 --> 28:11.249
But couldn't you?

28:11.417 --> 28:12.917
Okay.

28:13.544 --> 28:16.129
They can slaughter all of us!

28:18.716 --> 28:19.758
Right.

28:22.595 --> 28:28.058
3:00 p. M:
Attempted attack against a patrol.

28:28.434 --> 28:32.270
Location: Rue Luciani.
Weapon: 7.65mm revolver.

28:32.855 --> 28:36.107
4:00 p. M:
Attack on territorial guard,

28:36.317 --> 28:41.237
intersection of rue Consulaire
and Avenue Général Laquière.

28:51.874 --> 28:54.918
For Paris, the solution is to put
Algiers under tight police control,

28:55.086 --> 28:58.755
guard police stations,
close off streets.

28:58.923 --> 29:00.673
I don't agree.

29:04.678 --> 29:07.430
So, Corbière, where were we?

29:07.640 --> 29:11.309
"Intersection of rue Consulaire
and Avenue Général Laquière."

29:27.284 --> 29:29.452
<i>The governor general decrees:</i>

29:29.620 --> 29:35.166
<i>Article 1: Purchase of medication
for the treatment of gunshot wounds</i>

29:35.334 --> 29:38.545
<i>must be authorized
by the prefecture.</i>

29:40.381 --> 29:43.591
<i>Article 2:
Health care institutions</i>

29:44.427 --> 29:47.178
<i>must keep the police informed</i>

29:47.346 --> 29:52.267
<i>of all wounded patients
admitted for treatment.</i>

30:06.240 --> 30:08.533
<i>From the prefecture of Algiers:</i>

30:08.826 --> 30:13.580
<i>In recent days, dozens of attacks
have taken place in the city.</i>

30:14.540 --> 30:17.834
<i>The perpetrators are known
to come from the Muslim quarters.</i>

30:18.711 --> 30:23.756
<i>Each time, they quickly find refuge
in these areas.</i>

30:25.009 --> 30:28.219
<i>Consequently, to restore order,</i>

30:28.387 --> 30:32.223
<i>the prefect has decided
to seal off the Arab quarters.</i>

30:33.225 --> 30:36.519
<i>Checkpoints will be set up
at all access points.</i>

30:36.770 --> 30:40.565
<i>Civilians must show ID
and may be subject to searches.</i>

30:41.901 --> 30:43.276
In line!

30:50.242 --> 30:53.745
- Going back to the barracks?
- No, I've got two more days.

31:01.253 --> 31:02.587
Don't touch me!

31:04.465 --> 31:06.049
Keep your hands off me!

31:06.884 --> 31:08.593
Never touch their women.

31:09.553 --> 31:15.767
JULY 20, 1956 - 11:20 A.M.

32:05.442 --> 32:07.735
What are you up to?

32:07.945 --> 32:09.946
I'm meeting friends at the beach.

32:27.298 --> 32:30.008
- You still there?
- This is my route.

32:30.384 --> 32:31.759
Come here.

32:38.350 --> 32:40.310
Beat it.

33:06.545 --> 33:08.713
You go that way!
You, this way!

33:44.083 --> 33:47.251
Same old story!
It's the government's fault.

33:47.419 --> 33:50.088
What do they care?

33:50.297 --> 33:54.676
Murder all the bastards!
Then we'll have some peace!

33:54.843 --> 33:55.968
There he is!

33:56.428 --> 33:57.637
I'm sure it's him!

33:58.180 --> 34:00.890
- Where?
- Down there.

34:01.767 --> 34:03.017
Get him!

34:03.936 --> 34:05.770
Murderer! Murderer!

34:08.065 --> 34:10.233
He looks like a dirty <i>fellagha!</i>

34:11.944 --> 34:13.777
Where are you headed?

34:14.071 --> 34:17.197
- Filthy Arab!
- Don't let him get away!

34:17.408 --> 34:20.659
He's getting away! Stop him!

34:21.203 --> 34:22.620
I saw him!

34:23.455 --> 34:25.331
Stop him!

34:25.916 --> 34:28.626
He's getting away!

34:51.567 --> 34:53.525
<i>Culprit: Laknan Abdullah.</i>

34:54.360 --> 34:59.991
Laborer, married, three children.
Address: 8 rue de Thèbes.

35:02.661 --> 35:06.289
How many today?
- Seven attacks, three dead.

35:07.124 --> 35:12.378
One copy for the prefect,
the press, the archives and for you.

35:12.546 --> 35:14.380
Thanks. Night, Corbière.

35:14.548 --> 35:16.174
Good night, sir.

35:17.885 --> 35:19.260
Say, Corbière...

35:20.304 --> 35:22.263
where's rue de Thèbes?

35:22.723 --> 35:25.516
In the upper Casbah, I think.

35:26.727 --> 35:28.853
Good night, Mommy.

35:29.396 --> 35:31.022
Good night, children.

35:31.231 --> 35:34.609
Fatma, why aren't they in bed?

35:34.902 --> 35:37.236
They're just on their way.

35:38.197 --> 35:39.489
We must get going.

35:39.740 --> 35:42.784
What's your hurry?
You and your card games!

35:42.993 --> 35:46.454
Can't you play here?

35:47.706 --> 35:51.209
- One more for the road?
- Sure, one more.

35:52.127 --> 35:55.046
Sorry, we're already late.

35:56.632 --> 35:59.550
Good night everyone.
Hurry up.

35:59.718 --> 36:03.721
Good-bye, Lucien.
Don't keep Henri up too late.

36:15.818 --> 36:17.401
Get in back.

36:33.919 --> 36:36.128
- Is it far?
- We're almost there.

36:47.808 --> 36:50.268
- Can we go through?
- Too late.

36:52.396 --> 36:54.438
Curfew's already started.

36:54.815 --> 36:56.274
Let us through. He's with me.

36:57.693 --> 37:00.778
Very well, sir. Go on through.

37:31.476 --> 37:34.145
- No. 8, right?
- Yes. Make it snappy.

40:26.651 --> 40:30.654
Murderers! Murderers!

41:00.352 --> 41:02.853
Ali! Stop!

41:22.457 --> 41:25.793
Jaffar says you must stop.

41:25.961 --> 41:28.796
Listen to me, Ali.
Don't go down there.

41:29.089 --> 41:31.048
The army will slaughter us.

41:31.216 --> 41:32.716
Listen to me.
- Get out of here!

41:34.136 --> 41:35.553
Halt!

41:48.567 --> 41:52.570
Stay calm!
The FLN will avenge you!

41:52.779 --> 41:54.947
The FLN will avenge you!

43:41.680 --> 43:44.515
Stand guard on the roof.
You, come in.

43:49.396 --> 43:52.147
- Is this all right?
- Fine.

43:53.191 --> 43:54.400
Fine.

43:57.988 --> 43:59.530
No good? Listen.

43:59.906 --> 44:02.116
I'll take my son. It'll work.

44:03.618 --> 44:08.622
Okay, but use the rue du Divan
checkpoint. It's easier there.

44:08.790 --> 44:10.666
Then meet up with the others.

44:17.382 --> 44:19.091
Air France, rue Mauritania.

44:22.679 --> 44:24.722
The café, rue Michelet.

44:27.475 --> 44:29.393
The milk bar, rue d'Isly.

44:29.894 --> 44:31.687
The bomb timers are short.

44:32.355 --> 44:34.481
They'll be set outside the Casbah.

44:34.607 --> 44:37.401
Taleb is waiting for you
at the fish market.

44:38.069 --> 44:43.741
But then you must hurry.
You only have 30 minutes to place them.

44:46.619 --> 44:52.082
Good luck.

44:53.418 --> 44:55.544
God be with you.

45:12.103 --> 45:13.437
Halt!

45:24.491 --> 45:27.034
- Your papers.
- I forgot them.

45:27.202 --> 45:29.912
- Over there. Move it!
- They're at home.

45:30.455 --> 45:32.414
Let me go get them!

45:38.171 --> 45:40.255
- Get back.
- I'm in a hurry.

45:40.465 --> 45:42.174
I said wait!

45:43.593 --> 45:45.886
Get back or no one goes through.

45:46.096 --> 45:48.597
- Let me through.
- Wait there.

45:48.807 --> 45:51.183
- It's not fair.
- I said wait.

45:52.394 --> 45:54.853
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.

45:57.816 --> 46:00.526
May I go through, sir?
- Go ahead.

46:05.907 --> 46:07.199
Excuse me.

46:07.742 --> 46:09.410
It's all right.

46:33.184 --> 46:34.101
Hands up.

46:47.574 --> 46:49.283
Go on, madam.

46:50.076 --> 46:51.326
Go on.

47:01.921 --> 47:05.549
I'll only be an hour.
He's a good boy.

47:08.636 --> 47:10.179
Thank you.

47:16.394 --> 47:18.479
Going to the beach, miss?

47:18.646 --> 47:21.565
- How'd you know?
- Oh, I just guessed.

47:22.066 --> 47:23.901
Care for some company?

47:24.110 --> 47:26.403
Not today. I'm meeting friends.

47:26.571 --> 47:27.988
What a shame!

47:28.239 --> 47:30.616
Maybe another time?

47:30.783 --> 47:31.950
Who knows?

48:35.807 --> 48:41.937
Good luck.

49:20.351 --> 49:21.393
A Coke, please.

49:22.437 --> 49:25.314
Would you like to sit down?

50:32.090 --> 50:33.090
One hundred francs.

50:35.426 --> 50:37.177
Leaving, miss?

50:37.303 --> 50:38.762
What a pity.

51:47.165 --> 51:48.290
<i>Attention, please.</i>

51:48.458 --> 51:54.171
<i>Flight 432 to Paris
will be delayed for 20 minutes.</i>

52:06.976 --> 52:09.394
Care for another martini?

53:12.291 --> 53:13.792
What's going on?

53:20.925 --> 53:23.802
A propane tank must've exploded.

54:43.799 --> 54:46.092
The paratroopers are here!

54:46.177 --> 54:50.013
JANUARY 10, 1957

54:57.772 --> 55:00.315
<i>Jean Charrot, Inspector General</i>

55:00.524 --> 55:02.651
<i>on special assignment,</i>

55:02.818 --> 55:05.779
<i>presided over a special
meeting convened</i>

55:05.947 --> 55:10.450
<i>to organize the fight
against rebel activity.</i>

55:11.619 --> 55:16.414
<i>Major decisions were made concerning
the maintenance of law and order</i>

55:16.624 --> 55:19.793
<i>and the protection of persons
and private property.</i>

55:20.044 --> 55:25.090
<i>General Carelle
of the 10th Airborne Division</i>

55:25.341 --> 55:29.302
<i>will be in charge
of maintaining order in Algiers.</i>

55:29.428 --> 55:32.555
<i>He will command
all civil and military forces</i>

55:32.723 --> 55:36.184
<i>and exercise special powers
by official decree.</i>

55:47.530 --> 55:52.158
<i>Mathieu, Philippe.
Born August 5, 1907, in Bordeaux.</i>

55:52.368 --> 55:54.577
<i>Rank: Lieutenant colonel.</i>

55:54.787 --> 55:57.706
<i>Campaigns: Italy and Normandy.</i>

55:57.915 --> 56:00.875
<i>Member of an anti-Nazi
resistance movement.</i>

56:01.085 --> 56:06.381
<i>Expeditions: Madagascar and Suez.
Wars: Indochina and Algeria.</i>

56:06.632 --> 56:11.845
So we now average
4.2 attacks a day.

56:12.054 --> 56:16.307
We must distinguish between attacks
on individuals and bombings.

56:17.727 --> 56:19.936
As usual, the problem involves:

56:20.104 --> 56:24.691
First, the adversary,
and second, the means to destroy him.

56:25.443 --> 56:27.986
There are 400,000 Arabs
in Algiers.

56:28.195 --> 56:31.573
Are they all our enemies?
We know they're not.

56:32.450 --> 56:37.328
But a small minority holds sway
by means of terror and violence.

56:38.289 --> 56:43.293
We must deal with this minority
in order to isolate and destroy it.

56:44.795 --> 56:49.591
It's a dangerous enemy that
works in the open and underground,

56:49.759 --> 56:54.387
using tried-and-true revolutionary
methods as well as original tactics.

56:58.976 --> 57:02.103
It's a faceless enemy, unrecognizable,

57:02.271 --> 57:04.898
blending in with hundreds of others.

57:05.107 --> 57:09.444
It is everywhere. In cafés,
in the alleys of the Casbah,

57:09.612 --> 57:12.572
or in the very streets
of the European quarter.

57:13.824 --> 57:17.452
This footage was taken by the police

57:17.661 --> 57:20.914
with cameras hidden
around Casbah checkpoints.

57:21.123 --> 57:26.419
The police thought it might come in
handy, and indeed it does,

57:26.629 --> 57:29.839
to show the futility
of certain methods,

57:30.049 --> 57:32.509
or at least their drawbacks.

57:36.722 --> 57:40.975
I deliberately chose footage
taken shortly before

57:41.143 --> 57:44.187
a number of recent
terrorist attacks.

57:44.688 --> 57:48.691
Among all these Arab men
and women

57:48.859 --> 57:51.194
are the perpetrators.

57:51.445 --> 57:53.363
But who are they?

57:54.323 --> 57:56.032
How can we recognize them?

57:58.786 --> 58:03.456
ID checks are ludicrous.
If anyone's papers are in order,

58:03.582 --> 58:05.208
it's the terrorist's.

58:06.377 --> 58:12.257
Note the cameraman's hunch.
He's sure there's something in that box.

58:12.466 --> 58:15.718
And his film provides us
with the details.

58:18.139 --> 58:22.183
There might have been
a false bottom with a bomb inside.

58:22.393 --> 58:24.144
We'll never know.

58:24.353 --> 58:26.146
That's enough, Martin.

58:29.024 --> 58:31.401
We have to start from scratch.

58:31.902 --> 58:36.072
The only information we have
concerns the organization's structure.

58:36.240 --> 58:38.074
Let's start from there.

58:38.450 --> 58:40.285
It's a pyramid organization

58:40.536 --> 58:43.913
made up of a series of sections.
These sections, in turn,

58:44.165 --> 58:46.958
are made up of triangles.

58:47.168 --> 58:49.419
At the apex
is the Executive Bureau.

58:50.588 --> 58:53.590
The military head
of the Executive Bureau

58:53.757 --> 58:58.094
finds a competent person
and names him section head: No. 1.

58:58.262 --> 59:03.016
No. 1 finds two others:
Nos. 2 and 3.

59:03.100 --> 59:05.435
This makes up the first triangle.

59:06.103 --> 59:10.064
Now Nos. 2 and 3
each select two men:

59:10.232 --> 59:12.108
Nos. 4,

59:12.234 --> 59:14.360
5, 6 and 7.

59:14.987 --> 59:19.490
The reason for these geometrics
is that each organization member

59:19.700 --> 59:22.243
knows only three other members:

59:22.411 --> 59:24.370
The one who chose him

59:24.622 --> 59:26.915
and the two he himself chose.

59:27.082 --> 59:29.542
Contact is made only in writing.

59:29.710 --> 59:33.087
That's why we don't know
our adversaries.

59:33.255 --> 59:38.092
Because, in point of fact,
they don't know each other.

59:39.136 --> 59:41.804
To know them is to eliminate them.

59:42.473 --> 59:46.809
Consequently, the purely military
aspect of the problem is secondary.

59:47.645 --> 59:50.355
More important
is the policing aspect.

59:52.149 --> 59:54.442
I know you dislike that word.

59:56.070 --> 01:00:00.698
But it's the only one
that describes the work at hand.

01:00:00.908 --> 01:00:03.910
We must investigate
to reconstruct

01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:06.913
the pyramid and identify
the Executive Bureau.

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:09.415
The basis of our job
is intelligence.

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:12.961
The method: Interrogation.

01:00:13.712 --> 01:00:18.716
Conducted in such a way as
to ensure we always get an answer.

01:00:19.468 --> 01:00:24.555
In our situation, humane
considerations can only lead to despair

01:00:25.182 --> 01:00:26.432
and confusion.

01:00:27.851 --> 01:00:32.689
I'm sure all units will understand
and act accordingly.

01:00:33.857 --> 01:00:36.234
Unfortunately, success doesn't
depend only on us.

01:00:38.028 --> 01:00:40.238
The city must be at our disposal.

01:00:40.489 --> 01:00:42.156
We must comb it thoroughly

01:00:42.366 --> 01:00:44.534
and question all inhabitants.

01:00:45.035 --> 01:00:49.539
But that's where we run
into the maze of laws still in force,

01:00:49.707 --> 01:00:53.835
as if Algiers were a holiday resort
and not a battlefield.

01:00:54.503 --> 01:00:58.381
We've requested a free hand,
but it's hard to obtain.

01:00:59.049 --> 01:01:02.552
So we need an occasion
that will justify our intervention

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.721
and make it possible.

01:01:05.055 --> 01:01:08.182
We ourselves must create
this occasion.

01:01:09.059 --> 01:01:14.439
Unless our adversary provides us
with one, as it seems to be doing now.

01:01:29.872 --> 01:01:31.873
<i>To all militants:</i>

01:01:32.082 --> 01:01:36.586
<i>After two years of bitter struggle
in the cities and in the mountains,</i>

01:01:36.837 --> 01:01:40.048
<i>the Algerian people
have won a great victory.</i>

01:01:40.841 --> 01:01:42.759
<i>On Monday, January 28,</i>

01:01:42.968 --> 01:01:47.764
<i>the United Nations will open debate
on the Algerian question.</i>

01:01:48.766 --> 01:01:54.103
<i>Our entire organization will mobilize
to explain this event's importance.</i>

01:01:54.271 --> 01:01:59.442
<i>Beginning Monday, the FLN is calling
a week-long general strike.</i>

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:03.863
<i>During this period,
all armed action will be suspended.</i>

01:02:07.618 --> 01:02:10.912
<i>Le Monde!</i> Week-long strike!

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.257
The money, please.

01:02:30.432 --> 01:02:31.641
We did it!

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:40.400
<i>People of Algeria,</i>

01:02:41.068 --> 01:02:46.989
<i>colonial powers, failing to block
UN debate on the Algerian question,</i>

01:02:47.199 --> 01:02:52.328
<i>will attempt to demonstrate that
the FLN represents only a minority.</i>

01:02:52.538 --> 01:02:55.081
<i>World opinion is with us.</i>

01:02:55.249 --> 01:02:57.500
<i>Let us show our unity.</i>

01:02:58.043 --> 01:03:01.379
<i>Support the strike
proclaimed by the FLN.</i>

01:03:06.176 --> 01:03:10.304
<i>During this entire week,
stay away from European quarters.</i>

01:03:10.514 --> 01:03:13.850
<i>Do not leave the Casbah.
Avoid gathering in closed places,</i>

01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:17.186
<i>as this will facilitate raids.</i>

01:03:18.397 --> 01:03:22.316
<i>Give shelter to the poor
and homeless.</i>

01:03:22.526 --> 01:03:25.111
<i>Stock up on food and water
for a week.</i>

01:03:26.822 --> 01:03:30.867
- They seem calm.
- But you can feel something's up.

01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:37.540
Like rabbits in a cage.
Just as I hoped.

01:03:37.875 --> 01:03:40.877
Think they'll obey
the order to strike?

01:03:41.253 --> 01:03:42.462
I think so.

01:03:44.047 --> 01:03:47.675
- Is it going the way you wanted?
- I hope so.

01:03:47.801 --> 01:03:50.344
What are you calling the operation?

01:03:50.679 --> 01:03:52.221
Well, General...

01:04:10.157 --> 01:04:13.284
DRINK CHAMPAGNE

01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:23.920
- "Operation Champagne."
- Why not?

01:04:24.588 --> 01:04:27.423
Operation Champagne it is.

01:04:37.768 --> 01:04:41.145
The homeless, the unemployed,
the beggars.

01:04:41.396 --> 01:04:46.442
We've arranged for them to stay
with families during the strike.

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:49.779
That way they'll be
safe from police raids.

01:04:49.947 --> 01:04:53.157
But I don't think they should
have been brought here.

01:04:53.325 --> 01:04:55.535
It's a mistake.
- Why?

01:04:55.786 --> 01:05:00.122
You're here. We'd better
move you somewhere else.

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:04.168
- Don't you trust them?
- I do, but you never know.

01:05:04.753 --> 01:05:07.964
All right. You're in charge.

01:05:08.173 --> 01:05:13.094
If I were in charge,
you wouldn't be in Algiers now.

01:05:15.556 --> 01:05:18.975
- Duty first?
- Caution is best.

01:05:24.314 --> 01:05:28.234
Ali, take Ben M'Hidi
to the Maison des Arbres.

01:05:29.653 --> 01:05:31.487
Isn't he staying here?

01:05:31.655 --> 01:05:35.157
No. Go with him.
I'll wait for you to come back.

01:05:37.286 --> 01:05:38.786
What do you think?

01:05:39.788 --> 01:05:44.125
How's this for a hideout?
Looks like a wall.

01:05:45.002 --> 01:05:46.377
Take a look inside.

01:05:47.004 --> 01:05:48.796
Not now. It's late.

01:05:54.052 --> 01:05:56.721
Si Ben M'Hidi,
I'll be in touch tomorrow.

01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:59.056
Ali, go first.

01:06:06.857 --> 01:06:09.525
Cut through the mosque.

01:06:23.665 --> 01:06:26.542
The coast is clear.

01:06:33.175 --> 01:06:36.010
We can't do anything for a week.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.138
What do you think of the strike?

01:06:39.306 --> 01:06:40.723
I think it'll succeed.

01:06:40.891 --> 01:06:45.102
I think so, too.
It's been well organized.

01:06:46.104 --> 01:06:47.855
What will the French do?

01:06:48.023 --> 01:06:51.984
Obviously, they'll try everything
to break it.

01:06:52.694 --> 01:06:55.529
They'll do more than that,

01:06:55.739 --> 01:06:58.532
because we've given them
an opportunity.

01:06:59.368 --> 01:07:01.535
You know what I mean?

01:07:02.704 --> 01:07:06.457
Now they'll no longer
be groping in the dark.

01:07:07.542 --> 01:07:09.543
Every striker

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.254
will be a recognizable enemy.

01:07:12.464 --> 01:07:17.718
A certified criminal.
The French will take the offensive.

01:07:17.928 --> 01:07:21.097
Understand what I mean?
- Yes.

01:07:21.932 --> 01:07:25.893
Jaffar says you weren't
in favor of the strike.

01:07:26.186 --> 01:07:29.605
- No, I wasn't.
- Why not?

01:07:29.856 --> 01:07:33.275
Because we were ordered
not to use arms.

01:07:33.652 --> 01:07:37.113
Acts of violence don't win wars.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.990
Neither wars nor revolutions.

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.785
Terrorism is useful as a start.

01:07:42.953 --> 01:07:46.414
But then, the people
themselves must act.

01:07:46.623 --> 01:07:50.000
That's the rationale
behind this strike.

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:54.171
To mobilize all Algerians,

01:07:54.423 --> 01:07:56.632
to assess our strength.

01:07:57.509 --> 01:07:59.176
To prove it to the UN?

01:08:00.637 --> 01:08:02.680
Yes, to prove it to the UN.

01:08:03.223 --> 01:08:05.558
It may not do any good,

01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:11.313
but at least the UN will be able
to gauge our strength.

01:08:11.523 --> 01:08:13.315
You know, Ali,

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:16.484
it's hard enough to start
a revolution,

01:08:18.488 --> 01:08:21.657
even harder to sustain it,

01:08:21.825 --> 01:08:24.702
and hardest of all to win it.

01:08:24.911 --> 01:08:29.497
But it's only afterwards,
once we've won,

01:08:29.666 --> 01:08:32.376
that the real difficulties begin.

01:08:33.795 --> 01:08:37.590
In short, there's still much to do.

01:08:38.466 --> 01:08:40.468
You're not tired, Ali?

01:08:40.844 --> 01:08:41.969
No.

01:09:39.486 --> 01:09:40.736
Wake up!

01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:43.404
Everybody out!

01:09:50.913 --> 01:09:54.166
You bastards!
We'll teach you to strike!

01:10:45.969 --> 01:10:47.386
<i>Attention all vehicles!</i>

01:10:47.637 --> 01:10:52.308
<i>Load the requisitioned workers!
Truck No. 1 to El Biar.</i>

01:10:52.517 --> 01:10:54.351
<i>No. 2, the gasworks.</i>

01:10:54.519 --> 01:10:56.353
<i>No. 3, the docks.</i>

01:10:56.521 --> 01:10:58.856
<i>Attention!</i>

01:11:00.191 --> 01:11:03.402
<i>Dispatch all suspects
to headquarters.</i>

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.201
That one.

01:11:11.411 --> 01:11:14.496
You, come here. Stop.

01:11:14.998 --> 01:11:17.833
On strike, are you?
- I'm sick.

01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:22.254
You're too scared to admit it.
Admit you're with the FLN.

01:11:22.672 --> 01:11:25.007
You're one of them.

01:11:25.175 --> 01:11:28.218
Take me for an idiot?
Think I can't tell?

01:11:28.428 --> 01:11:33.098
The FLN wants you to strike
and you won't talk? You dirty Arab!

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:37.061
Suit yourself.
Gérard, take him away.

01:11:37.312 --> 01:11:39.813
- Come with me.
- Are you deaf?

01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.694
Everyone back to work!

01:11:47.364 --> 01:11:48.447
Get a move on!

01:11:51.868 --> 01:11:56.622
Day four:
The general strike continues.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:12:01.543
All activity has come to a halt.
No serious incident has been reported.

01:12:01.711 --> 01:12:04.630
All is quiet in the Muslim quarter.

01:12:06.549 --> 01:12:08.133
I'll call you back.

01:12:10.387 --> 01:12:11.720
Mathieu's here.

01:12:17.394 --> 01:12:20.062
- Some questions...
- I'm meeting with the prefect.

01:12:20.271 --> 01:12:24.692
- What's going on?
- I'm just assessing the situation.

01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:30.030
Go and see for yourselves.
You're free to move around.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.284
- The strike seems successful.
- It missed its main target.

01:12:34.411 --> 01:12:36.078
Insurrection?

01:12:36.287 --> 01:12:39.540
That isn't the aim.
- You believe the FLN?

01:12:39.749 --> 01:12:43.419
It's plausible this time.
A strike might convince the UN.

01:12:43.628 --> 01:12:47.631
The UN is far away.
How can it gauge a strike's magnitude?

01:12:47.716 --> 01:12:50.759
Bombs would be more practical.
That would be my choice.

01:12:52.804 --> 01:12:55.431
What would
armed insurrection mean now?

01:12:55.598 --> 01:12:59.935
What it always means: An inevitable
phase in revolutionary warfare.

01:13:00.145 --> 01:13:03.022
After terrorism
comes armed insurrection.

01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:06.817
Just as guerrilla warfare leads
to warfare proper.

01:13:07.027 --> 01:13:08.152
Dien Bien Phu?

01:13:08.361 --> 01:13:11.864
Exactly.
But in Indochina they won.

01:13:12.073 --> 01:13:14.283
- And here?
- That depends on you.

01:13:14.909 --> 01:13:18.162
On us?
You intend to sign us up?

01:13:18.371 --> 01:13:22.249
God forbid! Just do your reporting
and do it well.

01:13:22.459 --> 01:13:25.085
It's not warriors we need.
- Then what?

01:13:25.295 --> 01:13:28.630
Political will, which is sometimes
there and sometimes isn't.

01:13:28.882 --> 01:13:32.634
Sometimes it's not enough.
What did Paris say yesterday?

01:13:32.844 --> 01:13:35.554
Nothing. Another article by Sartre.

01:13:38.516 --> 01:13:41.643
Why are the Sartres
always born on the other side?

01:13:41.853 --> 01:13:43.645
Then you like Sartre?

01:13:43.855 --> 01:13:47.649
No, but I like him
even less as a foe.

01:13:52.155 --> 01:13:55.282
1, 2, 3, 4...
Come with me.

01:13:57.327 --> 01:13:59.328
Move it.

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.220
- What's that?
- The dance hall.

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:30.317
Let's get it over with.
Repeat what you said and you can go.

01:14:30.527 --> 01:14:32.027
Name?
- Smain.

01:14:32.237 --> 01:14:33.904
- First name?
- Ahmed.

01:14:34.114 --> 01:14:36.323
- Section?
- Second section.

01:14:36.533 --> 01:14:39.868
- Be more precise.
- Second section.

01:14:39.994 --> 01:14:41.537
Casbah, Algiers West.

01:14:41.663 --> 01:14:43.539
- Which group?
- Third group.

01:14:43.665 --> 01:14:48.502
- What was your role?
- Head of the sixth cell.

01:14:48.711 --> 01:14:49.878
That'll do.

01:15:56.529 --> 01:15:58.280
DAY SIX OF THE STRIKE

01:15:58.489 --> 01:15:59.907
<i>People of the Casbah,</i>

01:16:00.241 --> 01:16:03.785
<i>the FLN wants to stop you
from working.</i>

01:16:03.995 --> 01:16:07.831
<i>The FLN is forcing you
to close your shops.</i>

01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:13.003
<i>The FLN wants to starve you
and condemn you to poverty.</i>

01:16:13.171 --> 01:16:15.964
The FLN wants to stop you
from working.

01:16:16.299 --> 01:16:18.175
People of the Casbah,

01:16:18.509 --> 01:16:22.054
France is your motherland.

01:16:23.389 --> 01:16:28.685
Mohammed! Mohammed!
Have you seen him?

01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:35.651
<i>The FLN wants to starve you
and condemn you to poverty.</i>

01:16:36.236 --> 01:16:41.657
<i>People of the Casbah,
resist the FLN's orders.</i>

01:16:42.242 --> 01:16:44.701
Thank God you're home.

01:16:45.995 --> 01:16:48.997
God bless you, my children.

01:16:49.165 --> 01:16:51.667
Have you seen my brother Said?

01:17:29.289 --> 01:17:31.748
<i>Algerians! Brothers! Take heart!</i>

01:17:32.083 --> 01:17:35.377
<i>The FLN tells you not to be afraid!</i>

01:17:36.838 --> 01:17:40.340
<i>Don't worry, we're winning.</i>

01:17:42.051 --> 01:17:44.386
<i>The FLN is on your side.</i>

01:17:45.221 --> 01:17:48.348
Long live Algeria!

01:18:09.245 --> 01:18:11.163
FEBRUARY 5, 1957

01:18:11.331 --> 01:18:13.248
FINAL DAY OF THE STRIKE

01:18:33.102 --> 01:18:34.936
Open the shop.

01:18:49.786 --> 01:18:50.994
Go on!

01:18:51.579 --> 01:18:52.788
Faster!

01:19:10.973 --> 01:19:13.475
<i>The UN General Assembly,</i>

01:19:13.643 --> 01:19:19.648
<i>all motions having failed
to obtain a majority,</i>

01:19:19.816 --> 01:19:25.153
<i>has passed a resolution ruling out
any direct intervention in Algeria.</i>

01:19:26.322 --> 01:19:30.325
<i>The UN, however, hopes that
in a spirit of cooperation,</i>

01:19:30.535 --> 01:19:34.496
<i>a peaceful, democratic
and fair solution will be found</i>

01:19:34.664 --> 01:19:37.999
<i>in keeping with the principles
of the UN charter.</i>

01:20:27.341 --> 01:20:29.801
Good. Well done.

01:20:31.637 --> 01:20:33.555
Now we can go turn in.

01:20:35.266 --> 01:20:38.935
The end of the strike changes nothing.
Instructions remain the same.

01:20:39.145 --> 01:20:41.396
Give your boys the usual orders.

01:20:41.606 --> 01:20:45.484
We must occupy the Casbah
24 hours a day.

01:20:46.027 --> 01:20:49.988
We must continue our work here,
without respite.

01:20:58.748 --> 01:21:01.500
Any of you ever suffer from tapeworm?

01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:04.586
It's a worm that can grow infinitely.

01:21:04.754 --> 01:21:08.256
You can destroy
its thousands of segments

01:21:08.424 --> 01:21:13.094
but as long as the head remains,
it rebuilds and proliferates.

01:21:13.304 --> 01:21:15.555
The FLN is similarly organized.

01:21:15.765 --> 01:21:19.059
The head is the Executive Bureau.
Several persons.

01:21:19.227 --> 01:21:23.396
As long as they're not eliminated,
we're back to zero.

01:21:23.564 --> 01:21:25.357
Here are four of them.

01:21:30.905 --> 01:21:33.532
I found these in the police records.

01:21:33.783 --> 01:21:35.325
I had the snapshots blown up.

01:21:36.786 --> 01:21:38.411
Si Murad.

01:21:38.913 --> 01:21:40.121
Ramel.

01:21:41.123 --> 01:21:42.374
Jaffar.

01:21:47.213 --> 01:21:48.463
Ali La Pointe.

01:21:48.548 --> 01:21:53.009
Print up a thousand copies
and distribute them to our men.

01:21:53.678 --> 01:21:55.595
<i>Who else lives here?</i>

01:21:55.805 --> 01:22:00.976
<i>I told you. My daughter upstairs,
and my husband, who's at work.</i>

01:22:01.227 --> 01:22:04.271
<i>Okay, Pierre. Let's go.</i>

01:22:08.693 --> 01:22:10.360
<i>They're gone.</i>

01:22:38.055 --> 01:22:39.931
There were ten this time.

01:22:40.057 --> 01:22:41.516
- Paratroopers?
- Yes.

01:22:41.684 --> 01:22:44.352
Did a traitor bring them here?

01:22:44.562 --> 01:22:45.854
They came alone.

01:22:46.022 --> 01:22:49.149
They asked questions.
They didn't hurt anyone.

01:22:51.402 --> 01:22:54.738
<i>Jibela Malika has been arrested.</i>

01:22:55.573 --> 01:22:58.617
<i>Sheik Abdullah has been arrested...</i>

01:23:20.222 --> 01:23:25.477
<i>People of the Casbah,
the FLN has lost the battle.</i>

01:23:27.021 --> 01:23:30.982
<i>Stand up to its dying authority.</i>

01:23:31.233 --> 01:23:35.403
<i>Work with us to build
a new Algeria.</i>

01:23:36.656 --> 01:23:39.866
<i>Mujid Ben Ali has been arrested.</i>

01:23:54.924 --> 01:23:57.550
- What's wrong?
- They arrested him.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.260
Take courage.

01:24:12.949 --> 01:24:17.828
We'll split up.
We must change our hideouts.

01:24:18.413 --> 01:24:22.124
We must reestablish our contacts.

01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:25.544
We must replace
those arrested and killed

01:24:25.921 --> 01:24:27.588
and reorganize our groups.

01:24:28.423 --> 01:24:30.549
We have to make our presence felt.

01:24:30.759 --> 01:24:32.426
That'll come later.

01:24:32.594 --> 01:24:35.971
No. Right now.
Leave it to me.

01:24:36.848 --> 01:24:39.767
No. None of us will do anything.

01:24:39.976 --> 01:24:43.562
We have to resist
as much as we can,

01:24:43.772 --> 01:24:47.441
without giving the enemy
a chance to catch us. Agreed?

01:24:48.401 --> 01:24:50.486
We have to do something.

01:24:50.695 --> 01:24:53.697
That's why we must reestablish
our contacts first.

01:24:54.616 --> 01:24:57.952
- How do we move?
- I'll take care of that.

01:25:19.975 --> 01:25:22.101
I'll be out in three months.

01:25:22.269 --> 01:25:23.686
Hey, look!

01:26:30.086 --> 01:26:33.297
Quick, hide us!
We're being followed.

01:26:33.673 --> 01:26:36.508
Where? On the terrace?

01:26:36.885 --> 01:26:40.679
Come in, brothers.
God protect you.

01:26:42.891 --> 01:26:45.559
Hide in the well.
God be with you.

01:27:19.803 --> 01:27:24.848
They're gone. Wait until I call.
Then you can come up.

01:27:25.642 --> 01:27:26.975
Thank you.

01:27:30.689 --> 01:27:34.149
The first section's dead.
There's no one left.

01:27:34.984 --> 01:27:37.695
We lost contact with the second.

01:27:37.904 --> 01:27:39.863
The third is reorganizing.

01:27:40.031 --> 01:27:43.951
All that's left is the fourth.
It's enough to start over with.

01:27:44.452 --> 01:27:46.995
FEBRUARY 25, 1957

01:28:20.488 --> 01:28:24.199
Bastard!
You'll pay for the others!

01:28:31.666 --> 01:28:35.169
Keep calm! Get back!

01:29:06.284 --> 01:29:09.161
MARCH 4, 1957

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.459
No more photographs.

01:29:16.586 --> 01:29:18.003
Mr. Ben M'Hidi,

01:29:18.546 --> 01:29:21.423
isn't it cowardly to use
your women's baskets

01:29:21.591 --> 01:29:25.552
to carry bombs, which have
taken so many innocent lives?

01:29:27.305 --> 01:29:31.683
Isn't it even more cowardly
to attack defenseless villages

01:29:31.893 --> 01:29:35.145
with napalm bombs that kill
many thousands of times more?

01:29:35.355 --> 01:29:38.899
Obviously, planes would
make things easier for us.

01:29:39.108 --> 01:29:40.901
Give us your bombers, sir,

01:29:41.069 --> 01:29:43.362
and you can have our baskets.

01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:06.260
The FLN has more of a chance
of defeating the French army

01:30:06.469 --> 01:30:08.846
than the French have
of changing the course of history.

01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:12.808
According to a declaration
by Colonel Mathieu,

01:30:12.976 --> 01:30:16.562
you were arrested by chance.
Practically by mistake.

01:30:17.772 --> 01:30:19.356
The paratroopers

01:30:19.524 --> 01:30:24.278
were looking for someone
less important than you.

01:30:24.487 --> 01:30:27.614
Can you tell us why you were
in that apartment

01:30:27.782 --> 01:30:30.033
on rue Debussy?

01:30:30.451 --> 01:30:33.328
All I can say is
I wish I'd never set foot there.

01:30:35.206 --> 01:30:38.250
That'll be all.
It's late and we have work to do.

01:30:38.877 --> 01:30:39.918
So the show's over?

01:30:40.628 --> 01:30:42.045
Yes, it's over.

01:30:42.672 --> 01:30:45.299
Before it has
the opposite effect.

01:30:59.981 --> 01:31:05.235
<i>People of the Casbah,
the rebellion is dying out.</i>

01:31:06.988 --> 01:31:11.742
<i>Ali Mohammed, head of
FLN Section 2, was killed this morning.</i>

01:31:14.412 --> 01:31:16.413
<i>People of Algiers,</i>

01:31:16.915 --> 01:31:19.333
<i>turn in the agitators.</i>

01:31:20.043 --> 01:31:22.920
<i>Disassociate yourselves
from the rebel organization.</i>

01:31:25.089 --> 01:31:29.927
<i>The army is protecting you.
Trust in it.</i>

01:31:44.734 --> 01:31:46.193
Colonel Mathieu,

01:31:46.444 --> 01:31:50.405
the spokesman for
the Resident Minister, Mr. Gorlin,

01:31:50.573 --> 01:31:52.824
states that Larbi Ben M'Hidi

01:31:52.992 --> 01:31:54.993
hanged himself in his cell

01:31:55.703 --> 01:32:01.416
using strips of his shirt
that he made into a rope

01:32:01.626 --> 01:32:05.045
and tied to the bars of his window.

01:32:06.589 --> 01:32:11.468
Given his stated intention
to escape at the first opportunity,

01:32:11.636 --> 01:32:13.220
it was thought necessary

01:32:13.471 --> 01:32:16.556
to keep the prisoner bound

01:32:16.641 --> 01:32:20.477
hand and foot at all times.
In your opinion, Colonel,

01:32:20.687 --> 01:32:23.522
in such a condition, can a man

01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:28.986
tear his shirt up,
make a rope out of it,

01:32:29.153 --> 01:32:31.738
and hang himself from a window?

01:32:32.907 --> 01:32:35.117
Ask the spokesman about that.

01:32:35.493 --> 01:32:37.244
I didn't make such a statement.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:44.418
For my part, I had the chance
to appreciate the moral fiber,

01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:49.339
courage and commitment
of Ben M'Hidi to his own ideals.

01:32:49.549 --> 01:32:53.677
And so, notwithstanding
the great danger he represented,

01:32:53.845 --> 01:32:55.846
I pay tribute to his memory.

01:32:58.683 --> 01:33:02.686
There's been a lot of talk, not only
of the paratroopers' success,

01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:07.691
but also of the methods
they're said to use.

01:33:07.859 --> 01:33:09.609
Can you comment on this?

01:33:10.278 --> 01:33:13.697
Their success is the result
of these methods.

01:33:13.865 --> 01:33:15.699
One depends on the other.

01:33:15.867 --> 01:33:17.868
Excuse me, Colonel.

01:33:18.036 --> 01:33:22.539
It seems to be that, perhaps
out of an excess of caution,

01:33:22.707 --> 01:33:27.002
my colleagues keep asking you
indirect questions

01:33:27.170 --> 01:33:30.964
to which you can only reply
in a roundabout way.

01:33:31.174 --> 01:33:34.051
It would be better to call...

01:33:35.011 --> 01:33:38.972
a spade a spade.
So let's talk about torture.

01:33:39.182 --> 01:33:42.684
I understand.
And you? Have you no question?

01:33:42.894 --> 01:33:47.439
They've all been asked.
I'd just like more precise answers.

01:33:48.399 --> 01:33:53.653
Let's try to be precise.
The word "torture" isn't used in our orders.

01:33:53.863 --> 01:33:57.491
We use interrogation
as the only valid police method

01:33:57.658 --> 01:34:00.285
against clandestine activity.

01:34:01.079 --> 01:34:03.997
The FLN asks all its members,

01:34:04.207 --> 01:34:08.543
in case of capture,
to remain silent for 24 hours.

01:34:08.795 --> 01:34:10.921
Then they may talk.

01:34:11.214 --> 01:34:16.635
This gives the FLN time
to render any information useless.

01:34:16.844 --> 01:34:20.931
And us? What form of questioning
must we adopt?

01:34:21.099 --> 01:34:23.225
Civil law procedures,

01:34:23.434 --> 01:34:25.560
which take months
for a mere misdemeanor?

01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:27.771
Legality can be inconvenient.

01:34:27.897 --> 01:34:31.858
Is it legal to set off bombs
in public places?

01:34:32.276 --> 01:34:36.613
Remember Ben M'Hidi's answer
when you asked him the question.

01:34:37.824 --> 01:34:42.035
No, gentlemen, believe me.
It's a vicious circle.

01:34:43.287 --> 01:34:47.791
We could talk for hours to no avail,
because that isn't the problem.

01:34:48.543 --> 01:34:50.127
The problem is this:

01:34:50.461 --> 01:34:54.131
The FLN wants to throw us out
of Algeria, and we want to stay.

01:34:54.257 --> 01:34:57.259
Even with slight shades of opinion,

01:34:57.468 --> 01:35:00.303
you all agree that we must stay.

01:35:00.471 --> 01:35:04.391
When the FLN rebellion began,
there were no shades at all.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.979
Every paper, the communist press
included, wanted it crushed.

01:35:09.147 --> 01:35:11.648
We're here for that reason alone.

01:35:11.858 --> 01:35:15.068
We're neither madmen nor sadists.

01:35:15.278 --> 01:35:17.863
Those who call us fascists

01:35:18.114 --> 01:35:22.284
forget the role many of us
played in the Resistance.

01:35:22.493 --> 01:35:23.994
Those who call us Nazis

01:35:24.203 --> 01:35:27.747
don't know that some of us survived
Dachau and Buchenwald.

01:35:27.957 --> 01:35:31.835
We are soldiers.
Our duty is to win.

01:35:32.086 --> 01:35:34.171
Therefore, to be precise,

01:35:34.964 --> 01:35:37.757
it's my turn to ask a question.

01:35:37.967 --> 01:35:40.969
Should France stay in Algeria?

01:35:41.554 --> 01:35:43.805
If your answer is still yes,

01:35:44.015 --> 01:35:47.017
then you must accept
all the consequences.

01:37:37.295 --> 01:37:40.463
A doctor!
He's been stabbed!

01:37:58.024 --> 01:38:00.275
I'm out of ammo!

01:38:08.868 --> 01:38:10.660
Look there!

01:38:11.537 --> 01:38:12.579
Run them down!

01:38:25.509 --> 01:38:28.345
AUGUST 26, 1957

01:38:46.947 --> 01:38:48.531
Make way for the colonel.

01:38:50.201 --> 01:38:54.579
There's no point playing the hero.
Hand me the megaphone.

01:38:59.794 --> 01:39:02.879
Ramel. Si Murad.

01:39:03.506 --> 01:39:04.714
Listen:

01:39:05.716 --> 01:39:09.594
I wouldn't want to be
in your shoes when you're captured.

01:39:09.804 --> 01:39:11.721
You know we'll get you.

01:39:13.974 --> 01:39:20.605
Surrender and you won't be harmed.
You'll get a fair trial.

01:39:21.732 --> 01:39:23.691
Do you hear?
- Who's speaking?

01:39:24.527 --> 01:39:26.861
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.

01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:30.240
We don't trust you.

01:39:31.492 --> 01:39:33.326
Come closer.

01:39:35.246 --> 01:39:36.663
Let us see you.

01:39:37.164 --> 01:39:39.624
Why don't you trust me?

01:39:40.251 --> 01:39:43.169
Stand up so that we can see you.

01:39:43.379 --> 01:39:46.256
Keep your hands still
and in sight.

01:39:47.925 --> 01:39:52.846
But we want the promise
of a fair trial in writing.

01:39:57.393 --> 01:40:01.521
Give us a written promise.
Then we'll surrender.

01:40:02.356 --> 01:40:05.024
How do I get it to you?

01:40:05.443 --> 01:40:08.945
We'll lower our guns in a basket.

01:40:09.155 --> 01:40:11.322
Fair enough.
I'm make this statement in writing.

01:40:40.561 --> 01:40:41.769
Finished?

01:40:42.688 --> 01:40:44.105
Yes, finished.

01:40:50.654 --> 01:40:55.033
- Ready, Mathieu?
- Yes, but let's see you first.

01:41:06.337 --> 01:41:10.673
28, 27, 26,

01:41:11.133 --> 01:41:15.386
25, 24, 23...

01:41:22.853 --> 01:41:25.730
We can see them now.
Go ahead.

01:41:32.613 --> 01:41:33.863
Here.

01:41:34.031 --> 01:41:38.493
You know that when I give my word,
I keep it.

01:41:41.497 --> 01:41:44.040
The bastard! He got away!

01:41:55.052 --> 01:41:57.887
Faster, dirty Arab!

01:41:57.972 --> 01:42:00.265
Take this, you dog!

01:42:06.981 --> 01:42:08.690
Burn all the papers.

01:42:08.899 --> 01:42:10.817
SEPTEMBER 24, 1957

01:42:14.488 --> 01:42:15.780
Don't leave a trace.

01:42:23.831 --> 01:42:26.124
Which of you is Zakia?

01:42:26.959 --> 01:42:28.418
You?

01:42:28.627 --> 01:42:32.171
Go tell Jaffar to surrender

01:42:32.256 --> 01:42:34.716
or we'll blow up the house
and everyone in it.

01:42:35.009 --> 01:42:38.303
Try to convince him
if you want to keep your house.

01:42:38.512 --> 01:42:40.013
Got that?

01:42:41.432 --> 01:42:44.183
Wait. You'll get yourself killed.

01:42:44.435 --> 01:42:45.435
Jaffar!

01:42:46.770 --> 01:42:50.648
Zakia's coming up.
I wouldn't shoot if I were you.

01:42:50.899 --> 01:42:52.609
Go on now.

01:43:08.917 --> 01:43:10.376
Jaffar.

01:43:10.836 --> 01:43:12.295
Listen to me.

01:43:12.463 --> 01:43:14.881
They say if you don't come down,

01:43:15.090 --> 01:43:16.758
they'll blow up the house.

01:43:16.967 --> 01:43:20.762
You can tell them to blow up
whatever they want.

01:43:21.597 --> 01:43:23.181
Go tell them!

01:43:30.564 --> 01:43:33.483
He says he won't surrender,
that you can blow it all up.

01:43:33.651 --> 01:43:35.526
All right. Join the others.

01:43:37.821 --> 01:43:39.364
Prepare the explosives.

01:43:39.531 --> 01:43:42.408
Get as close as possible,
but don't take risks.

01:43:42.493 --> 01:43:44.243
Use a long fuse, then cut it.

01:43:44.453 --> 01:43:47.872
Give them cover while they work.

01:43:52.753 --> 01:43:57.674
You, keep your eyes open.
Anything can happen, as we know.

01:44:31.166 --> 01:44:35.628
It's really pointless
to die like this.

01:44:38.298 --> 01:44:43.720
Mathieu! If you give me your word
not to hurt anyone in this house,

01:44:43.887 --> 01:44:45.722
we'll come down.

01:44:54.398 --> 01:44:57.608
I'd have hated to blow you all up.

01:44:57.818 --> 01:44:59.026
Why?

01:44:59.987 --> 01:45:02.739
Your picture and your file

01:45:02.948 --> 01:45:05.616
have been on my desk for months.

01:45:05.909 --> 01:45:08.828
I have the feeling I know you a bit.

01:45:10.164 --> 01:45:13.499
You don't strike me as the kind
for empty gestures.

01:45:14.376 --> 01:45:17.295
You seem satisfied
to have me alive.

01:45:18.881 --> 01:45:19.839
Yes, I am.

01:45:20.924 --> 01:45:25.052
I thought you'd regret it.
I gave you an unexpected advantage.

01:45:25.888 --> 01:45:29.307
No, only the satisfaction
of having had the right hunch.

01:45:30.976 --> 01:45:32.059
Technically speaking,

01:45:32.311 --> 01:45:35.938
we can't talk about advantages.
The game's over.

01:45:36.607 --> 01:45:40.777
Monster! Hypocrite! You're wrong.
Ali La Pointe is still in the Casbah.

01:45:40.944 --> 01:45:42.111
What's she saying?

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:45.865
She says Ali La Pointe is still free.

01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:11.808
- Come in.
- I'm coming.

01:46:12.726 --> 01:46:15.561
You're tired. Go rest.

01:46:21.068 --> 01:46:22.568
Omar, go to bed.

01:46:22.736 --> 01:46:24.779
We have a job tomorrow.

01:46:24.947 --> 01:46:29.242
Myself, Mahmud, Hassiba...

01:46:33.372 --> 01:46:34.831
and you.

01:46:36.375 --> 01:46:41.504
There's no one else left.
Sadek will drive.

01:46:41.713 --> 01:46:46.175
You get out, plant the bomb,
and come back fast.

01:46:46.844 --> 01:46:50.680
Be sure they don't follow you.
Then we'll get out.

01:46:50.848 --> 01:46:54.851
Hassiba first, then Mahmud.
I'll see to the rest.

01:47:40.939 --> 01:47:42.315
Wake up.

01:47:47.154 --> 01:47:50.406
Sleep well?
Get ready to go.

01:47:55.996 --> 01:47:59.290
- Is it time?
- Almost.

01:47:59.791 --> 01:48:01.459
Hassiba!
- I'm ready.

01:48:01.668 --> 01:48:03.878
I heard a truck.

01:48:04.087 --> 01:48:07.965
So did I. But if it was Sadek,
he'd be here by now.

01:48:14.014 --> 01:48:17.266
- How's your wife?
- She's fine.

01:48:18.936 --> 01:48:20.603
Inside!

01:49:16.493 --> 01:49:17.702
Outside!

01:49:18.328 --> 01:49:19.578
On your feet!

01:50:13.216 --> 01:50:13.883
Well?

01:50:14.092 --> 01:50:16.469
All ready.
I had the house evacuated.

01:50:16.636 --> 01:50:19.430
- Has he answered?
- Absolute silence.

01:50:19.639 --> 01:50:21.432
I thought as much.

01:50:25.312 --> 01:50:26.562
Ali La Pointe!

01:50:27.731 --> 01:50:31.734
At least let the others out,
or you'll all be blown up.

01:50:32.527 --> 01:50:35.196
The boy will just go
to the reformatory for a while.

01:50:36.073 --> 01:50:37.948
Why let him die?

01:50:50.837 --> 01:50:53.089
He's still here?
Take him away.

01:51:04.768 --> 01:51:06.644
Ali... Ali La Pointe!

01:51:06.812 --> 01:51:10.272
You have another 30 seconds.
What are you hoping for?

01:51:10.524 --> 01:51:12.942
Anyway, you've lost.

01:51:14.111 --> 01:51:16.320
Think hard. Thirty seconds.

01:51:16.488 --> 01:51:18.614
Thirty seconds from now.

01:51:22.953 --> 01:51:25.037
Whoever wants to can go.

01:51:25.956 --> 01:51:29.792
- What'll you do?
- I don't trust them.

01:51:35.799 --> 01:51:38.968
You four stay here.
Come down when I give the signal.

01:52:30.729 --> 01:52:32.855
- Everything ready?
- All ready, sir.

01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:00.257
Stand back.

01:53:35.252 --> 01:53:38.295
You two cover him and be careful.
You never know.

01:53:46.346 --> 01:53:48.597
The tapeworm's headless now.

01:53:48.765 --> 01:53:51.100
Satisfied, Mathieu?
- Yes, sir.

01:53:51.268 --> 01:53:54.853
- The FLN is decapitated in Algiers.
- We'll hear no more of it.

01:53:56.106 --> 01:53:59.775
At least for the time being.
- Forever, let's hope.

01:53:59.943 --> 01:54:03.946
They're basically decent people.
We got on fine for 130 years.

01:54:04.114 --> 01:54:08.617
Why shouldn't it continue?
- But Algiers isn't all of Algeria.

01:54:08.827 --> 01:54:11.620
No, Algiers isn't all Algeria.

01:54:11.788 --> 01:54:16.375
True, but for now
let's settle for Algiers.

01:54:16.584 --> 01:54:19.378
Things are much easier
in the mountains.

01:54:26.636 --> 01:54:27.970
Good-bye, sir.

01:54:28.221 --> 01:54:32.308
Good-bye, Mathieu.
I'll see you this afternoon.

01:54:32.517 --> 01:54:33.976
Yes, sir.

01:54:38.523 --> 01:54:42.109
DECEMBER 11, 1960

01:54:51.828 --> 01:54:56.915
<i>For some unknown reason,
due to some obscure motive,</i>

01:54:57.417 --> 01:55:00.336
<i>after two years of relative quiet,</i>

01:55:00.587 --> 01:55:02.880
<i>with the war contained mostly</i>

01:55:03.006 --> 01:55:07.426
in the mountains, disturbances
broke out again without warning,

01:55:07.635 --> 01:55:11.013
and nobody knows why or how.

01:55:11.264 --> 01:55:14.183
<i>I phoned Tunis.</i>

01:55:14.351 --> 01:55:19.480
<i>I spoke to an exiled FLN chief,
but he knows nothing either.</i>

01:55:21.441 --> 01:55:24.860
Long live Algeria!

01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:40.250
<i>This morning, for the first time,
out came flags with crescent and star.</i>

01:55:41.044 --> 01:55:42.544
<i>Thousands of flags,</i>

01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:44.713
<i>probably made overnight.</i>

01:55:45.715 --> 01:55:50.094
<i>"Flags" is hardly the word.
More like torn sheets, shirts, rags -</i>

01:55:50.345 --> 01:55:52.221
<i>but flags nevertheless.</i>

01:56:02.107 --> 01:56:04.400
We're marching for freedom!

01:56:32.429 --> 01:56:34.179
<i>The situation is more tense today.</i>

01:56:35.223 --> 01:56:36.390
<i>Despite pressure</i>

01:56:36.641 --> 01:56:41.103
<i>from the most rigid colonialists,
the government had given orders</i>

01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:43.730
<i>not to open fire
except as a last resort.</i>

01:56:44.983 --> 01:56:50.279
<i>Attempts were made this afternoon
to descend into the European quarter.</i>

01:56:50.864 --> 01:56:55.784
<i>There were several casualties,
but things seem to have calmed down.</i>

01:56:56.661 --> 01:56:58.579
<i>The Muslim quarters still echo</i>

01:56:58.746 --> 01:57:01.999
<i>with those unintelligible
and frightening rhythmic cries.</i>

01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:54.403
<i>The surprising unity
of these demonstrations</i>

01:58:54.737 --> 01:58:58.282
<i>has made a deep impression
on French public opinion.</i>

01:58:58.533 --> 01:59:02.744
<i>According to Paris, a significant
segment of the political class</i>

01:59:02.954 --> 01:59:06.873
<i>is in favor of seeking
a new relationship with Algeria.</i>

01:59:14.257 --> 01:59:15.966
DECEMBER 21, 1960

01:59:16.134 --> 01:59:18.051
LAST DAY OF DEMONSTRATIONS

01:59:18.678 --> 01:59:20.387
Listen to me!

01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:24.391
Return to your homes!

01:59:27.186 --> 01:59:29.438
What do you want?

01:59:34.694 --> 01:59:36.445
Independence!

01:59:36.654 --> 01:59:38.780
Our pride!

01:59:41.075 --> 01:59:42.826
We want our freedom!

02:00:50.853 --> 02:00:54.064
<i>Two more years of struggle
still lay ahead.</i>

02:00:54.273 --> 02:00:58.276
<i>Then, on July 2, 1962,
with its independence,</i>

02:00:58.444 --> 02:01:00.904
<i>the Algerian nation was born.</i>
