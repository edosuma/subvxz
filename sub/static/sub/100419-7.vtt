Hello?

01:46.120 --> 01:47.000
Hello?

02:05.760 --> 02:07.040
Hey! Wait!

03:51.040 --> 03:52.360
I just wanna talk to you.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.080
About Corinne.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.320
About the secret you revealed.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.800
She's missing!

04:10.840 --> 04:11.680
Please!

05:03.200 --> 05:05.560

06:12.560 --> 06:14.560
-Who are ya?
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

06:14.640 --> 06:17.400
Who the fuck are you?!
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.720
I'm Thomas! Olivia's friend!
Please don't hurt me!

06:19.800 --> 06:21.320
She told me to hide. Call her.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.680
She'll tell you.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

06:25.120 --> 06:25.960
Okay.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.600
I'm not gonna hurt you.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.200
Are you Corinne Price's son?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.480
You scared me. I'm sorry.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.360
It's all right.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
Let's get out.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.320
Get out.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.200
I'm a policeman. I need the gun for work.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.680
-Right.
-Actually, that's not true.

07:02.760 --> 07:03.960
It's my own personal gun.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.200
I am a cop.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.800
Right.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.680
So why are you hiding?

07:12.680 --> 07:13.560
I'm sorry?

07:13.840 --> 07:16.200
If you're there as her mate,
why'd she tell you to hide?

07:16.280 --> 07:18.840
I don't know. She was scared.
She thought it was her mom.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.520
She's a sick girl.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.040
She worries, you know? She panics easily.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.680
What's actually up with her?

07:31.840 --> 07:33.720
-Eh?
-Her illness, what is it?

07:36.160 --> 07:37.200
Doctors don't know.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.400
I've taken her to so many specialists
and they're all... baffled.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.760
-Only...
-Only what?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.720
-Only what?
-Well, I might have this wrong, but...

07:53.520 --> 07:55.280
I don't know, my mom suspected something,

07:55.360 --> 07:57.280
and then Olivia's mom
snapped at her badly.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.160
Now my mom's gone missing,
and I don't know--

07:59.240 --> 08:02.920
Slow down. What are you talking about?
What do you mean, she suspected something?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.920
Well, I've seen for myself,
there's poison.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.840
Poison?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.480
Olivia's mom put empty bottles
of poison in the neighbor's bin.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.880
And I know it sounds crazy--

08:10.960 --> 08:13.120
What are you actually saying?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.560
My mom thought Olivia's mom...

08:19.080 --> 08:20.320
was making her ill

08:20.840 --> 08:21.760
on purpose.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.040
Hey.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.000
I need to talk with him
if you think he's ready.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.920
Yeah, sure.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.120
Oh, my God.

09:18.040 --> 09:18.960
Oh, my God.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.200
-I've got to go.
-I'm sorry.

09:21.760 --> 09:22.720
It's better I know.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.200
-Wait.
-There's a bus stop in the village.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.040
Shit.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.280
I can remember parts.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.960
It's all a bit hazy.

09:44.520 --> 09:45.440
You know?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.360
Anything you can remember will help.

09:47.840 --> 09:48.720
In any order.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.000
There was this party.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.000
In the field at Marsdale.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.200
<i>A silent disco.</i>

09:57.080 --> 09:58.960
<i>Everyone was up for it.</i>

09:59.040 --> 10:00.280
<i>You know, there was...</i>

10:00.360 --> 10:01.800
<i>this feeling of...</i>

10:01.880 --> 10:03.480
<i>"Let's make this a big night."</i>

10:04.480 --> 10:05.920
-Drugs?
-Maybe.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.560
Just tell the truth.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.160
Whatever it is, Dante.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.080
Actually, it might be best
if we can talk alone,

10:14.160 --> 10:16.360
if that's okay,
just so we can speak freely.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.880
We'll just be outside, okay?

10:20.360 --> 10:21.320
Thank you.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.120
So, drugs?

10:30.200 --> 10:31.120
Some, but...

10:32.560 --> 10:33.440
mostly drink.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.720
So do you remember
how you ended up naked?

10:36.240 --> 10:38.280
'Cause I assume
you were dressed at the party.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.560
There's this girl.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.080
<i>Daisy Hoy.</i>

10:41.160 --> 10:43.640
<i>We got dancing together. I fancied her.</i>

10:44.280 --> 10:46.720
<i>She was kind of with someone else but...</i>

10:47.240 --> 10:48.640
<i>not really, so...</i>

10:49.400 --> 10:52.000
<i>I asked if she wanted</i>
<i>to come take a walk with me.</i>

10:54.400 --> 10:55.720
<i>We went down the hill,</i>

10:55.800 --> 10:59.120
<i>and there's this lake,</i>
<i>and it looked amazing.</i>

11:00.880 --> 11:02.400
<i>So I said to her...</i>

11:02.960 --> 11:03.880
We should go in.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.360
It'll be freezing.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.360
You'll soon warm up.

11:08.520 --> 11:09.520
All right then.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
You go first.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.720
Tell me if it's cold.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.760
All right.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.400
Come on.

11:42.000 --> 11:42.840
Daisy?

11:43.840 --> 11:45.600
Yeah, ha ha, very funny.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.200
<i>Why would she do that?</i>

11:50.280 --> 11:51.200
I guess...

11:51.960 --> 11:53.560
I brought it on myself, really.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.040
You know,

11:55.120 --> 11:56.360
hitting on her...

11:57.240 --> 11:58.720
pretty hard.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.080
Maybe I pushed her to come.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.520
I supposed that was her way
of saying, "Back off."

12:03.600 --> 12:05.640
<i>So I'm walking through the forest,</i>

12:06.320 --> 12:08.000
<i>stark naked, trying to find her.</i>

12:09.160 --> 12:10.120
Daisy?

12:15.680 --> 12:16.640
Wait!

12:18.640 --> 12:20.000
You got me into trouble!

12:21.240 --> 12:22.400
So who's Max Bonner?

12:22.920 --> 12:24.080
Some kind of caretaker.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.520
He works at the sports club,
but he's...

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
He's a weirdo.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.520
"You got me into trouble"?

12:34.040 --> 12:35.960
I reported him to Mrs. Price.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.920
I filmed him fiddling
with the security cameras.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.440
Dante, we found footage you'd filmed

12:43.520 --> 12:46.120
of Mrs. Price, quite a lot of it,

12:46.200 --> 12:48.120
and now she's missing.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.240
Missing?

12:49.320 --> 12:50.320
Yeah.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.080
I... I don't know anything about that.

12:55.960 --> 12:56.840
I like her.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.360
That's all. It's a bit of a crush.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.480
I film lots of things.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.440
-It's what I do.
-We're gonna need to see that footage.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.080
Because it might be significant.

13:08.880 --> 13:09.800
Yeah.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.200
So you've got no recollection
of meeting anyone else

13:12.280 --> 13:13.800
after you ran away from Max Bonner?

13:14.400 --> 13:15.400
No.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.800
No one.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.640
Olivia?

14:15.200 --> 14:16.120
Liv?

14:16.640 --> 14:18.240
-Dad?
-Liv.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.000
Come here. Come here. Come here.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.200
-Dad?
-How could she do that to you?

14:23.080 --> 14:23.960
Okay.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.720
Everything's gonna be okay.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.680
There's gonna be no more sickness,
there's gonna be no more pain.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.440
-What do you mean?
-I know what's wrong with you, sweetheart.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.800
And we can make you better.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.640
I need you to pack a bag.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.880
You're gonna stay
with your Auntie Carol for a few days.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.280
-What? Why?
-Because...

14:40.240 --> 14:41.280
none of it's true.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.360
Your illness...

14:44.200 --> 14:45.080
it's a lie.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.400
-Your mother...
-What are you saying, Dad?

14:48.480 --> 14:50.800
I've gotta sort a few things out, okay?

14:50.880 --> 14:52.240
Then you're gonna
come stay with me.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.840
Trust me,
you need to get out of this house.

14:54.920 --> 14:55.760
Now.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.320
Are you okay?

15:13.360 --> 15:14.240
He had a gun?

15:15.600 --> 15:16.800
He was a cop, but yeah.

15:16.880 --> 15:17.840
How big was it?

15:18.360 --> 15:19.240
It was about...

15:20.800 --> 15:22.440
It was a gun.
What difference does it make?

15:23.000 --> 15:23.920
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.360
You must've been terrified.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.080
I think we need to tell the school
about Olivia.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.000
People have to know,

15:37.720 --> 15:38.920
so she definitely gets help.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.200
Yeah.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.360
Ah, very funny.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.880
You're a real prick. You know that, right?

15:59.360 --> 16:00.800
- It's not funny.
-Yeah, it is.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.320
- It's not.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.440
I wasn't a sporty kid. Were you?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.680
Yeah, very.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.280
Really?

16:09.840 --> 16:11.520
Yeah, really.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.800
Knock knock.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.520
He said you chased him and you yelled.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.480
Yelled?

16:26.440 --> 16:27.760
"You got me into trouble."

16:28.320 --> 16:29.320
'Cause he did.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.200
I'd done nothing wrong.
He made accusations.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.640
To Corinne Price?

16:33.720 --> 16:34.960
Yes, she's the...

16:35.800 --> 16:37.760
What's the word? Money person at the club.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.360
-"Treasurer."
-Yes.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.760
He films things.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.720
He's always got a camera stuck to his hand
and he filmed me.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.960
Said I was tampering with the security
camera that overlooked the office.

16:49.040 --> 16:49.920
And were you?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.280
No, I was fixing it.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.320
Do you know Corinne Price is now missing?

16:54.760 --> 16:56.680
You have no knowledge
of where she might be?

16:56.760 --> 16:57.640
No. Why would I?

16:58.040 --> 17:01.240
Right, so the night Dante was injured,

17:01.760 --> 17:04.560
you saw him and he was naked?

17:04.640 --> 17:06.000
Yes, naked boy.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.880
He said you had an axe.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.720
For wood.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.920
And it's not an axe,
it's a splitting maul.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.840
What's that?

17:13.400 --> 17:14.240
Like a...

17:14.680 --> 17:16.080
small axe.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.960
So it was an axe, albeit small?

17:19.560 --> 17:23.120
Do you often go out chopping wood
that time of night?

17:23.200 --> 17:24.600
I live on the edge of the woods.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.880
A lot of things happen
in the woods at night.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.960
Max, I'm gonna have to ask you this:

17:32.040 --> 17:33.640
Did you attack Dante?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.760
Because he was found hours later
at the bottom of the hill by the lake.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.920
I didn't attack him, I didn't.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.240
I didn't!

17:41.960 --> 17:43.000
I was getting wood!

17:44.520 --> 17:45.920
I know what you think of me.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.760
We don't think anything of you.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.520
It's the same as everyone else.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.280
I hear what they say about me.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.880
I did chase him.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.160
I chased him, but he was fast.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.400
Go on.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.160
He was running away...

18:01.880 --> 18:03.240
and I shouted after him.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.880
Wait! Wait!

18:27.760 --> 18:29.160
So you left him?

18:29.240 --> 18:31.240
I didn't know he was hurt, I swear.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.840
Is he all right?
Is everything gonna be all right?

18:47.680 --> 18:48.560
Ryan?

19:03.200 --> 19:04.480
I love you, mate.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.080
I'm right here.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.560
Okay?

19:18.080 --> 19:20.840
Hi. I'm sorry for the late hour.

19:20.920 --> 19:21.880
That's okay.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.080
Do you wanna come in?

19:25.800 --> 19:30.120
I've had officers check CCTV
at the airport,

19:30.200 --> 19:33.280
and it would appear
that Corinne didn't take a flight.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.080
Right.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.240
Unless she somehow
sourced a fake passport.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.880
She's not gonna do that.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.640
The boys are here, so...

19:42.320 --> 19:44.360
We've also checked your financial records,

19:44.440 --> 19:47.880
and there are no irregularities
with your accounts.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.440
So that would suggest there's no money
come from the sports club.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.440
She wouldn't.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.920
She loves that club.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.360
Ask anyone.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.600
You've been together for years, yeah?

20:08.960 --> 20:10.400
Yeah, we met at uni.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.080
You want one?

20:12.880 --> 20:13.760
Go on then.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.680
I was pissed in a bar,

20:16.080 --> 20:18.040
looking for a one-nighter
and there she was.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.720
She had this laugh.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.960
Wicked sense of humor.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.320
She looked amazing.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.280
We ended up having a drunken snog
but nothing came of it.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.240
But...

20:32.720 --> 20:35.560
ridiculous coincidence,
which we of course decided was fate,

20:35.640 --> 20:37.960
we met again through a charity

20:38.040 --> 20:40.640
that took care of kids
in disadvantaged parts of the world.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.600
Oh, pair of do-gooders.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.240
We volunteered for this mission
in Johannesburg.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.920
But when we got there,
there was this massive thunderstorm

20:53.000 --> 20:54.840
that washed all the road away and...

20:55.960 --> 20:58.440
somehow we ended up
offering to share a room.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.800
I bet you did.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.400
That was the night that I knew...

21:05.360 --> 21:06.640
this was the real deal.

21:06.720 --> 21:09.480
We went back again for our honeymoon,
just for a day, and...

21:10.120 --> 21:12.280
we were met with such...

21:12.360 --> 21:13.440
joy and love.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.360
We always said we'd go back again...

21:20.800 --> 21:21.800
with the boys.

21:24.680 --> 21:25.560
Sorry.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.960
No, don't be. I understand, trust me.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.440
I seem to be losing people
who are close to me, so...

21:34.200 --> 21:35.960
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.200
Sorry.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.280
Hey, mate.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.000
I heard voices.

21:44.680 --> 21:45.560
I thought it was Mom.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.280
Hi, I'm the detective...

21:58.920 --> 22:00.160
investigating the case.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.480
We'll do our best
to find your mom, I promise.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.400
<i>Bum got stung.</i>

22:10.440 --> 22:11.440
<i>Again.</i>

22:12.680 --> 22:13.760
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

22:29.200 --> 22:32.960

22:37.200 --> 22:39.360

22:39.440 --> 22:40.640

<i>Oh, Jesus!</i>

23:23.880 --> 23:24.760

23:30.480 --> 23:32.240
You didn't have to stay with her,
you know.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.160
This isn't what you think.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.360
There's more to this.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.200
You are so fucked in the head,
do you know that, Leila?

23:48.280 --> 23:51.440
Do you realize the fucking psychological
and physical damage

23:51.520 --> 23:53.440
that you've inflicted
on your own flesh and blood?

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
Do you realize?

23:55.880 --> 23:56.920
Is it 'cause of me?

23:57.600 --> 23:58.640
Is it 'cause I left you?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.960
I mean, is this some kind of sick revenge?

24:01.040 --> 24:01.960
Is that what it is?

24:02.880 --> 24:04.760
And you have no idea what I've done...

24:06.080 --> 24:07.080
for this family.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.160
You sick, evil bitch!

24:28.080 --> 24:29.280
Ah, there you are.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.120
Have you heard from Katz today?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.880
Maybe I was too hard on him.
Maybe I overreacted.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.920
Hey, you all right?

24:42.160 --> 24:43.680
It's Heidi's memorial today.

24:43.760 --> 24:44.760
God.

24:46.120 --> 24:46.960
I'm sorry.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.240
I'd feel a bit better
if we knew who did this to her.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.720
How can I look her family in the face?

24:54.880 --> 24:57.160
I think Phillip's right.
I am too close to this.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.800
Hey, don't worry about that for now.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.280
Today just...

25:03.480 --> 25:04.400
be her friend.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.240
I'll keep working on the case from here.

25:07.320 --> 25:09.640
I'll go through the evidence
from the night of her murder,

25:09.720 --> 25:11.400
see if there's anything I might've missed.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Hug?

25:17.560 --> 25:19.080
Let's not get all American.

25:20.040 --> 25:20.880
Yeah.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.440
Hi. Sorry for arriving unannounced.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.040
This is a friend of mine.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.600
Hi.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.720
Peter Ince, private investigator.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.520
PI by name, PI by nature.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.440
What is this?

25:37.520 --> 25:39.640
-Well, your father told me--
-I'm asking him.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.280
Peter's excellent.
He's a corporate investigator.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.880
He helps me in a professional capacity,

25:44.960 --> 25:47.880
and I think he can help you with Corinne.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.200
You're paying him, are you?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.640
Talk to me like I'm a five-year-old.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.800
Just walk me through step-by-step
exactly how this all started.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.000
Look, I really--

25:58.080 --> 26:00.000
Like a five-year-old. Trust me.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.200
Listen, I've already explained

26:02.280 --> 26:07.040
that the police are saying that Corinne's
key fob was found at a murder scene,

26:07.120 --> 26:08.120
which doesn't add up.

26:08.200 --> 26:12.400
And she's been accused of stealing,
which equally doesn't add up.

26:12.960 --> 26:17.000
All Peter needs to know is if
there were any significant conversations

26:17.080 --> 26:18.680
that you had before she went missing.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.760
Mm-hmm, exactly that.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.800
I asked her
if she faked her pregnancy.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.400
-Faked a pregnancy?
-What?

26:25.480 --> 26:26.920
-Yeah.
-How would she do that?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.480
She used a website
where you can buy fake scans,

26:29.560 --> 26:32.400
fake bellies, whatever you like.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.040
Why would she do that?

26:35.120 --> 26:37.080
Because she wanted... to...

26:38.480 --> 26:39.320
I don't know...

26:40.400 --> 26:41.960
trick me into...

26:42.040 --> 26:43.360
staying or something.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.760
She thought I was having an affair.
I was having an affair.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.760
Well, almost. Things had started to...

26:51.200 --> 26:54.080
What can I say? I'm an idiot.
I take after my father.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.360
When was this fling?

26:58.360 --> 26:59.400
About two years ago.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.920
So this fake had happened
a couple of years ago, right?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.040
Mm-hmm.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.960
-And you only challenged her now?
-Yeah.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.120
She didn't deny it. We argued.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.400
She said that there was more to it.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.520
She said, "There's things
that you don't know."

27:15.600 --> 27:16.440
Okay.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.200
Okay, so let's walk it back a step, yeah?

27:21.280 --> 27:24.600
You're saying that this fake
had happened a couple of years ago?

27:24.680 --> 27:25.800
Mm-hmm.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.560
So why are you only fighting about it now?

27:27.640 --> 27:28.520
Because...

27:32.560 --> 27:35.040
Well, I would never
have found out about it.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.880
I wish I never had found out about it.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.720
But this woman came to me
at the sports club,

27:39.800 --> 27:41.720
this stranger, and just blurted it out.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.160
What did she look like?

27:43.640 --> 27:46.200
Twenties, mixed race, attractive.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.320
Shit.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.240
What?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.040
She came to me.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.840
What do you mean?
Came to you saying what?

27:52.920 --> 27:54.720
-This is unbelievable.
-Saying what?

27:55.640 --> 27:56.920
She told me I had another child.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.400
Just like that, she sits down.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.760
She says, "You have affairs,
you have a child,"

28:01.840 --> 28:03.520
and then, bang, up and out of the door.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.640
Wait.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.160
Look.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.160
Shit.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.400
It's the same.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.360
Yes.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Who the hell is this?

28:20.600 --> 28:21.760
She didn't ask you for money?

28:22.320 --> 28:23.520
-No.
-No.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.520
No.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.480
Are we being played?
Is this some kind of set-up?

28:26.560 --> 28:29.680
-I think we need to find out who this is.
-I saw her again yesterday.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.200
-Where?
-At the hospital.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.680
I was visiting Killane.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.400
I told you Killane wanted you
involved in the case.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.320
He does all sorts
of paid investigating work.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.160
What if he was somehow involved
with this woman?

28:47.240 --> 28:49.200
What if he was part of her bullshit?

28:49.280 --> 28:50.800
-How?
-I don't know!

28:51.160 --> 28:54.360
Look, at his house he had all of this...

28:55.040 --> 28:58.160
surveillance equipment,
like a homemade detective agency.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.040
-We need to visit him in hospital.
-I've tried.

29:00.120 --> 29:02.120
The police won't let me in.
You have to be family.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.080
His possessions, Killane's possessions...

29:08.120 --> 29:09.360
they're in storage.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.360
Where?

29:10.440 --> 29:11.720
My company has them.

29:12.640 --> 29:13.960
I have access.

29:15.840 --> 29:19.080
This is something that Heidi had...

29:20.640 --> 29:23.920
...on the wall
of her office in the bakery.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.560
And...

29:26.000 --> 29:28.360
it occurred to me when I saw it again

29:28.440 --> 29:30.240
that it perfectly captures...

29:32.320 --> 29:33.280
her spirit.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.920
It's called <i>Inventory</i> by Dorothy Parker.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.320
"Four be the things I am wiser to know:

29:46.240 --> 29:48.200
idleness, sorrow,

29:48.640 --> 29:50.640
a friend and a foe.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.360
<i>Four be the things</i>
<i>I'd been better without:</i>

29:56.760 --> 29:58.160
<i>love,</i>

29:58.240 --> 30:00.520
<i>curiosity, freckles</i>

30:01.360 --> 30:02.400
<i>and doubt.</i>

30:04.840 --> 30:07.320
<i>Three be the things I shall never attain:</i>

30:08.560 --> 30:09.960
<i>envy, content,</i>

30:10.640 --> 30:12.560
<i>and sufficient champagne.</i>

30:13.760 --> 30:16.760
Three be the things
I shall have till I die:

30:20.640 --> 30:22.760
laughter and hope

30:23.200 --> 30:24.680
and a sock in the eye.

30:43.960 --> 30:44.800
Thank you.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.120
-Do you want me to bend over, Larry?
-Patrick--

31:54.200 --> 31:56.480
No, I'll bend over now,
make it easier for you to screw me.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.080
-Now look--
-Don't "now look" me.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.640
Don't use that tone of voice with me.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.160
You get ten percent of this business
when it becomes a business.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.760
These women are gonna destroy all that.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.560
If you wanna look after your daughter,
you need that money.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.880
-As it happens, my daughter--
-Listen, you're in too deep.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.920
You killed someone.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.560
-We have to stop them.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.920
Who the hell is that?

32:19.520 --> 32:20.560
Hi.

32:20.640 --> 32:21.560
Johanna.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.320
I was hoping we could have a chat.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.720
Of course, yeah. I mean, give me one...

32:30.200 --> 32:32.600
-You've gotta go now. You've gotta leave.
-What?

32:32.680 --> 32:35.240
-It's a woman from work.
-We haven't finished our meeting.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.160
Listen, message received, loud and clear.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.560
-So we're agreed?
-Yes.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.320
-You're gonna clean up this mess.
-Yes, I'll clean it up. Get out.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.560
There's a path
around the side of the house.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.800
Don't let her see you.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.680
Come in.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.200
Sorry about that.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.160
Forgot I left the bath running.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.000
So I needed to...

33:04.800 --> 33:05.840
Can I get you something?

33:06.760 --> 33:07.760
No, I'm fine.

33:08.440 --> 33:09.280
Cup of tea?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.080
Yeah, okay.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.480
Uh, milk and sugar?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.440
Milk, no sugar, thanks.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.600
About yesterday,
I know you weren't happy--

33:21.680 --> 33:23.600
No, I wasn't.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.920
Your actions sabotaged
the whole operation.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.240
Yeah, I know, you said.

33:27.320 --> 33:29.080
I don't understand why you did
what you did.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.360
I know, you said.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.280
If you've come to my house to bollock me--

33:32.360 --> 33:33.280
I haven't.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.840
-I came because I'm worried about you.
-Oh, yeah, why is that?

33:41.600 --> 33:43.360
Have you looked in the mirror recently?

33:44.600 --> 33:45.560
Are you sleeping?

33:45.960 --> 33:46.880
I'm fine.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.280
No, you're not fine.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.560
Are you drinking?

33:50.640 --> 33:51.480
No.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.720
Look, I'm saying this as a friend.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.200
-All right, as a colleague.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.840
How long have we known each other?

33:57.280 --> 33:59.560
Patrick, you're not all right.

34:00.360 --> 34:03.080
You are making errors,
letting things slide,

34:03.480 --> 34:04.440
and it matters.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.840
In other jobs, you can coast,
but what we do, it matters.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.000
Says the woman
blubbing over her dead friend.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.160
Hey.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.720
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.000
Look, you messed up the op.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.480
And you forgot to file
a missing persons report on Corinne Price.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.120
I linked her to a murder scene.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.840
It was me that found the evidence
directly connecting her

34:36.920 --> 34:38.000
to Heidi's Doyle's murder.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.480
Which is strange in itself

34:40.560 --> 34:43.240
because the café had already been searched
by Scene of Crime.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.560
Those useless pricks.

34:44.640 --> 34:46.040
What? Well, they're not, are they?

34:46.120 --> 34:48.280
They couldn't find their own dicks,
that Emmett guy,

34:48.360 --> 34:50.120
whatever his name is. Idiot.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.240
Why aren't you willing to accept
that Corinne Price was involved?

34:57.320 --> 34:58.160
Instinct.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.120
School teacher, mother of two,

35:00.200 --> 35:03.400
and no connection whatsoever
to the victim.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.720
So who did kill her, then?

35:13.400 --> 35:15.640
Look, you're right, you are.
I'm not in a good place.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.240
I found out something.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.400
My daughter, and it's really...

35:22.120 --> 35:23.760
It's really knocked me for six.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.120
I'm sorry to hear that.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.520
I know she's not been well.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.360
Not well.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.840
Exactly. Sick kid.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.160
That's what you think, right?

35:35.240 --> 35:38.160
Katz, he's the one with the kid who's
in and out of hospital the whole time.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.200
Well, process this:

35:42.760 --> 35:44.600
She's fine, she's not sick.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.800
It's her mother who's sick in the head.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.720
She's been poisoning Olivia.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.920
I mean, how can you do that
to your own child?

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
It's a syndrome thing, I've looked it up.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.760
It's called "Munchausen by proxy."

35:56.840 --> 35:58.200
She needs locking up.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.720
She's been twisting Olivia's mind to make
her think there's something wrong with her

36:01.800 --> 36:04.040
while simultaneously
pumping her full of rat poison.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.000
And all the time I've been stressed

36:06.080 --> 36:10.240
and I've been killing myself
to try and find her the right treatment.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.320
And I've been earning extra money,
doing extra hours,

36:13.400 --> 36:14.960
to pay for these specialists,

36:15.040 --> 36:16.440
and there's nothing wrong with her.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.440
There's nothing wrong with her.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.560
Mate, mate, I'm sorry. Come here.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.280
Come.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.360
I'm gonna sort it out. I'm gonna get her
to come live with me.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.000
Yeah. Yeah, good.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.600
- Shit! I'm sorry!

36:37.680 --> 36:38.760
Take it, it's fine.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.160
The infant...

36:44.320 --> 36:45.160
Hello?

36:45.240 --> 36:47.080
Jo, you're not gonna believe this.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.120
The night of Heidi's death,
I found something.

36:50.000 --> 36:50.880
Let's hear it.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.080
<i>-You'll wanna hear this.</i>
-What is it?

36:53.480 --> 36:56.480
<i>So I'm viewing the CCTV from the area</i>
<i>from the night of her murder.</i>

36:57.040 --> 37:00.120
-We requested footage in a mile radius.
-Yeah.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.400
I'm looking at the footage
from the train station.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.320
<i>And 20 minutes before her time of death,</i>

37:04.400 --> 37:06.880
<i>who gets off the train and walks</i>
<i>in the direction of the café?</i>

37:07.680 --> 37:08.680
Who?

37:08.760 --> 37:09.600
<i>Katz.</i>

37:13.640 --> 37:15.080
<i>Do you hear me? Katz.</i>

37:15.160 --> 37:16.160
Yeah, I heard you.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.880
<i>Remember, the footage</i>
<i>from the café got wiped.</i>

37:19.320 --> 37:21.640
<i>-He was the one in charge--</i>
-I'm actually with Katz now--

37:23.120 --> 37:24.040
I'm at his house!

37:25.880 --> 37:26.720
Jo?

37:30.640 --> 37:31.520
Patrick?

37:32.760 --> 37:33.880
We can talk about this.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.840
And say what?

38:49.440 --> 38:50.600
Open the door, Johanna.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.120
Tell me what happened.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.280
Open the door.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.000
We can talk about this.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.440
Did you kill Heidi?

38:57.760 --> 38:59.240
Things got out of hand, okay?

38:59.320 --> 39:01.440
I didn't mean to kill her, I promise you.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.680
She wouldn't tell me what I needed.
It got out of hand.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.560
Why did you go there?
How did you know her?

39:05.640 --> 39:07.760
I was trying
to make things better for Olivia.

39:07.840 --> 39:10.240
Okay? I was just trying to be a good dad.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.520
That's all I was doing.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.640
Open the door!

39:13.880 --> 39:15.480
Open the fucking door!

39:22.320 --> 39:23.600
Open the fucking door!

39:24.800 --> 39:25.840
Shit.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.800
Fuck!

39:40.560 --> 39:41.400
Help!

39:41.840 --> 39:42.920
Oh, shit!

39:43.400 --> 39:44.240
Help!

39:45.400 --> 39:46.280
She's fine!

39:46.360 --> 39:47.360
Shut up!

39:47.880 --> 39:48.720
Patrick!

39:56.280 --> 39:57.600
No, you don't wanna do this.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.200
You're not this person.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.560
I think it's fair to say
we're in a bit of a fix.

40:48.920 --> 40:49.920
Oh, my God.

40:51.680 --> 40:52.880
What?

40:55.120 --> 40:56.280
<i>What?</i>

40:56.360 --> 40:57.520
Adam, what is it?

41:13.960 --> 41:14.840
Chrissy?

41:16.000 --> 41:16.840
Dad.
