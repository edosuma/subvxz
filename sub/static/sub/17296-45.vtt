We seem to be stable again.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.330
Not for much longer if we
can't find Michael and Aaron.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.365
Them fools is in the wind, yo.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.267
We ain't never gonna find 'em.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.203
I think this calls
for a last meal.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.610
This place sure is filled
with a bunch of sad sacks.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.546
Now, look at these fools!

00:45.579 --> 00:48.516
They be eating sourdough loaf
and them big sandwiches.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.319
How much bread do you need?

00:53.254 --> 00:55.223
It's them!

00:55.256 --> 00:56.524
You're Aaron Horvath!

00:56.557 --> 00:58.392
Oh, good.
The Titans are here.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.428
And you're Michael Jelly-neck.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.729
Jelenic.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.364
Yellow neck.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.298
Jelenic.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.469
Jelenic.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.671
You's the guys who make us?

01:10.704 --> 01:12.106
This can't be them!

01:12.140 --> 01:13.641
They are putting me
under the whelm.

01:13.674 --> 01:17.245
These are the guys
that control our destiny?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.180
You think we control you?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.215
You control us!

01:21.249 --> 01:23.251
Our whole lives
revolve around you guys.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.153
We've been making
one episode a week

01:25.186 --> 01:27.121
for 199 weeks.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.490
That is
a very aggressive schedule.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.459
What could be better
than making us?

01:31.492 --> 01:33.227
Spending time with my kids.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.464
They are the cute.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.166
Come on.
How hard can it be?

01:38.199 --> 01:39.500
All you do is write fart jokes!

01:39.533 --> 01:41.635
Those fart jokes
come from character.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.437
But if you don't
write a new script,

01:43.471 --> 01:45.339
the Teen Titans
will no longer exist!

01:45.373 --> 01:46.540
That's not true.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.142
The Teen Titans
will live forever.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.677
You know, as reruns.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.744
There's also the comics.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.347
So, that's it.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.782
That's all you have to say?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.384
Can we get more bread?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.419
Okay, cool.
Thanks for nothing.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.355
Who knew the guys who
controlled us were such jerks?

02:01.389 --> 02:03.191
Too bad we don't control them.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.559
That's it.
We need to control them!

02:05.593 --> 02:07.228
But we are
just the make-believe.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.529
And they are the real.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.198
Haven't you learned
anything today?

02:10.231 --> 02:13.267
Make-believe becomes real
if you believe in it enough!

02:13.301 --> 02:14.902
All we have to do
is write an episode

02:14.935 --> 02:18.406
about Michael and Aaron
writing the 200th episode.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.474
And then
we'll continue to exist!

02:20.508 --> 02:22.810
That plan makes the pain
in my head.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.345
That's real meta.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.946
I once met a dog.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.681
No, Beast boy. Meta means...

02:27.715 --> 02:28.849
Ugh, never mind.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.751
Guess what?

02:30.784 --> 02:33.621
You two are about to become stars
of your own animated episode!

02:33.654 --> 02:35.356
- That's fine.
- Oh, sure.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.624
I'm not really
interested in anything.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.759
- You know, I don't care.
- That's fine.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.535
Charming.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.503
This is for real
Jelly-neck's office?

02:49.537 --> 02:51.439
It's got that dungeon-chic vibe.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.940
If we're going
to make an episode,

02:52.973 --> 02:55.243
we're going to have to do it
just like they do it.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.412
And this is where they come up
with all the stories for our show.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.248
How can they write
so many episodes

03:00.281 --> 03:02.916
about food in a place that
makes you lose your appetite?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.285
Ugh.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.786
Wait a minute.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.888
If this is Michael's office,
where does Aaron sit?

03:10.491 --> 03:12.793
The filth...

03:12.826 --> 03:13.961
Forget the mess!

03:15.963 --> 03:18.932
We have to come up with a story about
them writing the 200th episode!

03:18.966 --> 03:20.634
I have the idea.

03:20.668 --> 03:23.837
It all begins on the dark
and the stormy night.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.674
Lightning the booms!

03:26.707 --> 03:30.678
Michael and Aaron
sit at the desk, and then...

03:32.012 --> 03:33.847
They write the story.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.718
Uh, I don't know, Star.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.987
That doesn't sound like
it's gonna have enough farts.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.889
Beastie's right.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.791
If we're gonna tell a good story,
we're gonna need more flatulence.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.294
True. That's how Michael
and Aaron do it on our show.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.728
Hmm...

03:47.761 --> 03:49.463
How about Michael and Aaron
eat too many vegetables

03:49.497 --> 03:50.964
and every time they think
of an idea, they fart.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.868
I like where this is going!

03:54.902 --> 03:58.506
Oh, yes! The creative juices
are the flowing, now!

03:58.539 --> 04:00.741
Warner Ranch, day!
Enter Michael and Aaron,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.910
their bellies filled with gas.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.545
From eating too many vegetables.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.551
Okay, Michael and Aaron, sorry about
the issue with the drive-on passes.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.421
Anyway, we've got a great script,
let's take it from the top.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.523
And don't forget
to have fun with it.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.793
Mmm-mmm.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.796
I sure enjoyed our veggie lunch.

04:24.832 --> 04:28.636
I sure hope this helps
lower my cholesterol.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.571
Oh, no! My tum-tum.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.676
Okay. That was, uh, great.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.010
Now, just a couple of notes.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.779
First, your voice
sounds terrible.

04:38.812 --> 04:42.082
Can you make them sound
less grating and more pleasant?

04:42.115 --> 04:45.353
Uh... That's how we talk.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.721
How unfortunate. Okay.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.623
Then, can you
at least be louder?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.792
You know, like how you
make us scream all the time?

04:51.825 --> 04:54.462
Like that. Okay.
From the top.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.798
I sure enjoyed our veggie lunch!

04:57.831 --> 04:58.966
Louder!

04:58.999 --> 05:02.403
I hope this helps
lower my cholesterol!

05:02.436 --> 05:04.572
Oh, no, my tum-tum!

05:04.605 --> 05:06.106
The louder.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.542
Louder.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.979
Louder, fools!

05:13.481 --> 05:15.449
My throat is bleeding.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.918
It hurts.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.524
That's great, guys.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.093
We just want to adjust to these
character designs a little bit.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.897
Yeah. We wants to make them look
as dumb as you made Robin look.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.766
So, we're gonna need to make
their heads a lot bigger.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.936
We said, big!

05:36.870 --> 05:38.772
The bigger. The bigger!

05:42.410 --> 05:43.644
Now, make them look dumb.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.078
You know, like...

05:45.112 --> 05:46.714
I'm Michael and I'm Aaron

05:46.747 --> 05:47.948
and I think I'm so funny,
but I'm not.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.620
Wonderful!

05:52.653 --> 05:54.788
Yo, guys.
I took a look at your script.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.924
This is gonna
be impossible to animate.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.026
Don't worry about it, Pete.
The crew will take care of it.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.962
Your script isn't producible.
It's a mess!

06:01.995 --> 06:04.598
Pfft. We'll just figure it out
as we make it.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.133
Yeah, it's a cartoon,

06:06.166 --> 06:08.101
not a science rocket.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.970
Here's your episode.
Imma be real with y'all.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.672
There's some problems.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.607
Is being too good a problem?

06:46.640 --> 06:47.641
Boom!

06:49.109 --> 06:52.145
I think make-believe
is about to become a reality.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.017
Veggie lunch. Lunch, lunch...

06:57.050 --> 06:58.519
My cholesterol.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.989
I so enjoyed our veggie lunch.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.692
I hope it helps lower my cholesterol!

07:05.926 --> 07:07.728
Oh, no! My tum-tum!

07:09.797 --> 07:11.899
- My tum-tum.
- Veggie lunch.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.768
Oh, no, my cholesterol.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.071
Comedy gold!

07:19.072 --> 07:22.643
Oh, no. Why are we
still doing the fading?

07:22.676 --> 07:24.645
Because this is bad, Star.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.948
Make-believe only becomes real if you
put your heart and soul into it.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.551
So, you're saying
we just can't hack it out?

07:30.584 --> 07:31.885
Okay. New plan.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.054
Redo the whole thing
with heart and soul.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.089
Nah, man.
You had your shot.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.759
Listen, Pete. We're not asking.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.061
Security.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.637
So, how did the episode go?

07:49.670 --> 07:50.738
Not so good, I bet.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.540
Yo, it stank, man.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.843
Can't believe you've made
a 199 good to mediocre ones.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.945
It was a lot of work
for one terrible one.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.148
We're exhausted. Plus, now we have
to hear from haters on the internet.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.050
This show ruined my childhood.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.519
Maybe now you can understand
where we're coming from.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.954
You can't give up on us!

08:06.987 --> 08:08.956
We're as much a part of you
as you are of us!

08:08.989 --> 08:12.225
What are you gonna do instead?
Get real jobs?

08:12.259 --> 08:15.028
We'd love to help you,
but if we did this one,

08:15.062 --> 08:17.297
then we'd have to do another one
and then another one,

08:17.330 --> 08:18.331
it would never stop.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.168
- It's, a...
- Very aggressive schedule.

08:21.201 --> 08:24.104
The only scenario I can imagine
us doing the 200th episode

08:24.137 --> 08:26.306
is if we could put ourselves
and our families in it.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.709
But, that seems
so self-indulgent.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.879
Yeah, something like that would
push the boundaries of good taste.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.886
So, this is how we go out.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.655
In the end,
we're left with a question.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.190
What is reality?

08:43.223 --> 08:44.758
Are we the real?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.259
Are Michael and Aaron real?

08:46.293 --> 08:49.697
Or are we just tiny points
in one of them good fractals?

08:49.730 --> 08:52.199
The real question is not
whether or not we're real.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.802
It's, "Does any
of this matter?"

09:01.108 --> 09:02.810
Hey, are those...

09:02.843 --> 09:05.012
- I think it's...
- The farts?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.880
Farts can only mean one thing!

09:06.914 --> 09:10.651
Michael and Aaron must've realized
we are forever interconnected!
