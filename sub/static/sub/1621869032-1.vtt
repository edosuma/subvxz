00:11.344 --> 00:14.514
-  To this
day, our normative leader

00:14.556 --> 00:16.474
in the United States
is a white man.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.729
It's what we understand
until very recently,

00:20.770 --> 00:22.522
a Governor looks like a Senator,

00:22.564 --> 00:24.482
looks like a
Representative looks like.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.693
That's what we understand.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.861
The President looks like.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.529
That's what our
history has taught us.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.031
It's what we read in the books.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.367
Those who are not
white or not male

00:35.535 --> 00:37.996
or both,
not white and not male,

00:38.038 --> 00:40.206
are presumed in some
way to be marginal

00:41.416 --> 00:44.544
to that fully human,
fully realized,

00:44.586 --> 00:47.422
fully comprehensible citizen,
that is the white male.

00:58.933 --> 01:02.562
-  For too
long, the history of women

01:02.604 --> 01:06.232
has been a history of silence.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.360
-  Something we
do in the United States

01:09.402 --> 01:11.738
is we like to tell ourselves
that our inequalities

01:11.780 --> 01:13.114
are things of the past.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.032
We fixed them.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.369
- For all practical
purposes, you think a woman

01:18.411 --> 01:21.039
in the United States
today, actually being

01:21.081 --> 01:22.749
nominated as President.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.794
- I stand before you
today, as a candidate

01:25.835 --> 01:28.421
for the Democratic
nomination for the Presidency

01:28.463 --> 01:30.924
of the United States of America.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.761
-  This process
of diversifying leadership,

01:34.803 --> 01:37.430
of getting somewhere
closer to actual

01:37.472 --> 01:41.434
representative democracy,
isn't gonna be fixed quickly.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.769
- And we've heard it before.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.438
This is the year of the
woman in American politics.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.108
-  We see
these fits and starts.

01:49.818 --> 01:58.284
- It took 150 years
after the signing

01:58.326 --> 02:00.620
to win the right to vote.
Independence for women

02:00.662 --> 02:05.625
- And 51 votes for
the next President

02:05.667 --> 02:08.086
of the United States of America,

02:09.211 --> 02:13.967
Hillary Rodham Clinton!

02:14.008 --> 02:16.177
- Even though we'd
never had a major party

02:16.219 --> 02:18.972
female nominee for
the Presidency before,

02:19.013 --> 02:20.849
we assumed that
she was gonna win.

02:20.890 --> 02:21.975
He is obviously

02:22.016 --> 02:23.601
never going to be President.

02:23.643 --> 02:27.814
- How could this
person possibly win?

02:27.856 --> 02:30.483
-  Trump is
headed for a historic defeat.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.318
- We'll win in November.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.654
We'll elect Hillary
Clinton the next

02:34.696 --> 02:37.198
President of the United States.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.493
-  We have
lost a sense of why

02:40.535 --> 02:42.620
this was an improbable victory.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.123
-  There's something
about her I just don't like.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.833
- I could stand in the
middle of Fifth Avenue

02:46.875 --> 02:49.502
and shoot somebody, and I
wouldn't lose any voters, okay?

02:49.544 --> 02:51.212
With the race now

02:51.254 --> 02:53.464
in the voters' hands, a top
Clinton campaign official

02:53.506 --> 02:55.508
telling me this morning
they feel confident

02:55.550 --> 02:59.137
about the race they've run
and a chance to make history.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.847
- We have a major
projection right now.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.516
Donald Trump will take Ohio.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.226
Donald Trump, vastly

03:05.268 --> 03:07.478
over-performing expectations.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.354
- Let me tell you this.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.856
It is Florida, Florida, Florida.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.900
Florida is the entire

03:11.941 --> 03:13.401
ball game for Donald Trump.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.698
-  The
scene here is so different

03:18.740 --> 03:21.326
than it was a few hours ago.

03:21.367 --> 03:25.371
- We have now confirmed that
Secretary Clinton has conceded.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.541
You're awake, by the way.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.543
This is your life now,
this is our election now.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.420
This is us, this is our country.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.716
lively classical music

03:36.758 --> 03:38.343
-  I think a
lot of people realize

03:38.384 --> 03:40.553
how fragile democracy is.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.055
-  My
body my choice!

03:42.096 --> 03:45.725
- For so many of us
it was the real belief

03:45.767 --> 03:48.728
that rights could be taken away.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.564
-  It was the
biggest single day

03:51.606 --> 03:54.275
political protest in
this country's history.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.946
-  After that
extraordinary outcry,

03:57.987 --> 04:00.531
a lot of people felt
like that was a moment,

04:00.573 --> 04:03.117
and then we were all
gonna forget about it.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.578
-  When you hear it
written off by so many

04:05.620 --> 04:08.289
officially important
people as just having

04:08.331 --> 04:10.583
fundamentally been some
party about pussy hats,

04:10.625 --> 04:12.543
it's still very
tempting to believe

04:12.585 --> 04:13.586
an overarching
narrative that says,

04:13.628 --> 04:16.214
"Oh, but what are
they gonna do really?"

04:16.255 --> 04:18.591
- Right after the
November election,

04:18.632 --> 04:21.594
and really right after
the Global Women's March,

04:21.636 --> 04:24.555
we started getting an
inordinate number of calls.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.433
- We woke up the next
day to tons of emails,

04:27.475 --> 04:30.728
tons of phone calls, women
from all walks of life

04:30.770 --> 04:33.773
saying, "If not
Hillary, then who?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.441
"Then me, it has to be me."

04:35.483 --> 04:37.110
- It's the right race,
it's the right time,

04:37.151 --> 04:38.319
and I'm the right candidate.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.320
Seeing a surge of women

04:39.362 --> 04:40.780
candidates across the country.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.782
-  What's
behind the surge of women?

04:42.824 --> 04:45.618
- I see women
waking up like I've

04:45.660 --> 04:47.328
never seen them awakened before.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.622
- Women who had taken
for granted that

04:49.664 --> 04:51.791
their interests were covered.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.168
- We cannot have a government
for and by the people,

04:54.210 --> 04:57.338
if it is not represented
by all of the people.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.465
- If we want to live
in this country,

04:59.507 --> 05:02.010
we have to fight
for it every day.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.971
Put ourselves on the line,
put ourselves out there,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.307
and become those
elected officials.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.489
I wanna thank you all

05:23.531 --> 05:24.824
for coming out here.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.784
I want to thank Indivisible
DFW for putting on this rally

05:26.826 --> 05:28.828
and giving us the
opportunity to, most of us

05:28.870 --> 05:32.790
for the first time, to come
up, and as we run for office,

05:32.832 --> 05:35.793
introduce ourselves and throw
ourselves into the fray.

05:35.835 --> 05:36.669
Thank you.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.006
Thank you very much.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.216
- We're gonna keep
the sneak peeks going.

05:42.258 --> 05:45.803
We have Jana Sanchez, a
Congressional candidate

05:45.845 --> 05:49.682
for the Sixth District.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.853
- I guess we're
the true patriots,

05:53.895 --> 05:55.521
willing to stand in
this weather today

05:55.563 --> 05:57.690
to work for democracy.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.983
Thank you for coming out.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.694
Many of us have
been living in fear

06:01.736 --> 06:04.072
and anxiety since November 8th.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.241
Many of us are worried
about what could happen

06:07.283 --> 06:09.869
to our friends and family
who could be swept up

06:09.911 --> 06:11.871
in the anti-immigrant hysteria

06:11.913 --> 06:14.415
that's sweeping the country.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.710
Nonetheless, I'm here
today to say one thing.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.339
Do not be afraid.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.550
If there's ever been
a time in the history

06:24.592 --> 06:27.220
of our country that
we need to be brave

06:27.261 --> 06:31.724
in the pursuit of
democracy, now is that time.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.726
Do not be afraid.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.733
-  I was so devastated by
the election results

06:40.775 --> 06:43.027
and so worried
about our country.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.738
I didn't sleep on November 8th,

06:45.780 --> 06:48.449
but I sure as hell woke
up on November 9th.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.743
Hi, this is Jana Lynne Sanchez.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.746
I'm running for U.S.
Congress to South Dallas.

06:53.788 --> 06:54.914
I felt I had to do something.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.083
I felt I could do something.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.210
I just had to run,
I had to do it.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.466
I'm running in a district
that no one believes,

07:05.508 --> 07:07.593
almost no one
believes is winnable.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.722
We're gonna have a lot of
battles over immigration,

07:11.764 --> 07:14.142
over guns and over healthcare.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.894
There will be a lot of
Republican money coming in.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.941
This district is not
a Republican area,

07:21.983 --> 07:24.777
it's just a non-voting area.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.321
We're cynical.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.949
We don't believe that
anyone's gonna do anything.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.242
So we stay home.

07:32.827 --> 07:37.331
There are 264,000 possible
Democrats in this district.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.958
They're registered to vote.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.418
They've never been contacted.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.752
Are you not a voter?

07:41.794 --> 07:43.671
What has to happen is
you have to engage them.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.970
I'm running because
I'm very concerned

07:51.012 --> 07:52.430
about the future of our country,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.932
about the state of democracy.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.269
I'm running because my
grandfather was an immigrant.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.982
I'm running because we
can do so much better.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.445
And I'm running because
I think I can win.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.323
- Hey guys, it's Lauren.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.657
I'm out canvassing
for signatures

08:11.699 --> 08:13.993
so that I can get on the ballot.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.620
We have members
of Team Underwood

08:15.661 --> 08:17.830
at the Sycamore parade today
and at other neighborhoods

08:17.872 --> 08:20.166
across our great 14th District.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.545
For some groups of people,
their idea in their mind

08:24.587 --> 08:26.172
of a member of Congress is not

08:26.214 --> 08:28.007
someone in her early thirties.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.550
Hi guys, it's Lauren.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.010
I'm here in King County
collecting signatures

08:32.053 --> 08:32.886
to get on the ballot.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.683
When the 2016 election
happened, I was faced

08:37.725 --> 08:39.227
with this America on
TV that didn't look

08:39.268 --> 08:40.852
anything like what I knew.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.356
-  This is
what democracy looks like!

08:43.397 --> 08:46.984
- We deserve better,
particularly in the face

08:47.026 --> 08:49.028
of this craziness coming
out of the White House.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.404
Hi, I'm Lauren Underwood.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.031
- Hi.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.241
-  We have the most
signatures to get on the ballot.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.701
2,080 is what we submitted
on the first day.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.204
That was enough to
like blow our minds.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.711
- I think my parents are
stunned and surprised

09:05.753 --> 09:07.213
and excited and overwhelmed.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.881
It's one thing to
encourage your children

09:08.923 --> 09:10.258
to step forward and to serve.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.385
It's another thing
for a whole community

09:12.426 --> 09:13.386
to rally behind them.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.679
Thanks everybody.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.057
Yeah, we did it!

09:18.099 --> 09:21.227
We are on the verge of
a generational shift.

09:21.269 --> 09:25.273
So many of our congressional
leaders are 65 plus.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.274
I'm 31.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.900
I think it's great.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.278
It also lets us, you know,
run a race authentically.

09:30.319 --> 09:33.072
So I say that we keep
it real here and we do.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.907
Hi, are you Noah?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.075
- Yes, I am.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.034
- Hi, I'm Lauren Underwood.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.869
- Oh, hi.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.081
-  It's so
good to see you.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.541
I'm running for Congress
in this community.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.208
-  Oh, absolutely,
yeah I know about you.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.418
-  Here's
some info. Okay, thank you.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.711
-  Thank you.

09:46.752 --> 09:47.920
-  No one invited
us to this table.

09:47.962 --> 09:51.299
No one invited us.

09:51.340 --> 09:55.261
And I think that's
also what makes it

09:55.303 --> 09:58.264
so powerful is
building something.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.440
-  Seven days in a week.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.775
I am running for Congress
all day, every day,

10:09.817 --> 10:11.068
during those seven days.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.113
I've missed so many birthdays,

10:14.155 --> 10:15.948
you know, major life events.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.117
I've never missed
a wedding ever.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.786
And I've just missed two
back to back this month.

10:20.828 --> 10:24.915
I've given up
everything to do this.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.918
Each day, there's probably two
meals that I eat in the car.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.128
If I don't have
an hour that week,

10:29.170 --> 10:30.338
my hair is not fabulous, right?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.297
Reality.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.965
This dress is machine washable.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.592
That is why I have it on
today, because I could

10:34.634 --> 10:36.302
put it in the washer
and the dryer.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.678
Oh my god, right?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.472
And that's just real life.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.182
My car makes little noises now.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.310
It has its own Lauren
Underwood for Congress

10:44.352 --> 10:47.480
growing pains.

10:47.521 --> 10:52.318
The barriers to running
are so significant

10:52.360 --> 10:55.863
that sometimes you
have to just be real.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.161
We're so focused on having
this facade of perfection.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.121
We are chasing towards
the wrong thing.

11:05.373 --> 11:09.669
Being perfect every day would
make me lose this campaign.

11:16.425 --> 11:19.178
-  I don't really like
bringing my family into it.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.513
Hi, Lila!

11:20.554 --> 11:23.182
'Cause you know, not
everybody is kind.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.733
Are you practicing
what you're gonna say?

11:35.194 --> 11:38.989
- So much of this is
about human connection,

11:39.031 --> 11:41.200
showing that you're
real and that you care.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.035
This is my daughter Lila.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.370
-  Hi Lila.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.579
-  She wanted to come
out door knocking.

11:45.621 --> 11:46.372
Did you wanna
shake Harry's hand?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.040
- Hi.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.166
Okay, good luck.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.543
- Okay thank you,
I appreciate it.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.544
Okay, come on Lila.
- Okay, all right then.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.045
- Okay, have a good night.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.171
You know, it's interesting.

11:54.213 --> 11:59.051
I think that even people
who have a hard time

12:00.219 --> 12:01.762
picturing women in
office, when you say,

12:01.804 --> 12:03.222
"What would you want
for your daughter?

12:03.264 --> 12:05.224
"What would you want
for your granddaughter?"

12:05.266 --> 12:07.226
They'll say, "I want
her to have the same

12:07.268 --> 12:09.562
"opportunities
that any guy has."

12:09.603 --> 12:13.441
You know, they don't
wanna think about anybody

12:13.482 --> 12:15.443
shortchanging their
daughter or granddaughter.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.111
And it's a way to
talk to people.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.911
You know, again, it's just
make it personal, you know.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.873
My idea of a town hall,
and I think what all of us

12:28.914 --> 12:31.709
think a town hall is, is an
opportunity for the public

12:31.751 --> 12:34.462
to come in and engage
with their representative.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.256
I think we deserve that.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.924
-  Yeah.

12:38.966 --> 12:42.052
- I got activated, I think
in trying not to have

12:42.094 --> 12:43.095
the outcome of this

12:43.137 --> 12:44.430
presidential
election that we got.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.932
I started out my legal
career representing

12:46.974 --> 12:48.225
working people
who are threatened

12:48.267 --> 12:50.102
with losing their benefits.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.605
There is a level of
neglect that is built

12:52.646 --> 12:54.440
into our treatment
of poor people

12:54.482 --> 12:56.734
that is simply brutal
and outrageous.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.446
We've seen, you know,
what it looks like

13:00.488 --> 13:02.615
when somebody attacks the
rights that we thought

13:02.656 --> 13:03.949
were well-established.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.743
And it's not just
women's rights.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.454
It's all civil rights
that are under attack.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.289
I'm the candidate
to flip the seat

13:10.331 --> 13:13.292
because I am the
person who goes into

13:13.334 --> 13:16.837
pancake breakfasts and
asks people, you know,

13:16.879 --> 13:19.507
"Tell me what's going
on in your life."

13:19.548 --> 13:20.841
- It's nice to meet you.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.302
- And what I hear
is that people have

13:23.344 --> 13:24.637
a lot of struggles
that have to do with

13:24.678 --> 13:26.096
not having good-paying jobs.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.640
That have to do with
people whose kids

13:27.681 --> 13:30.976
have ended up
addicted to opioids.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.645
I hear about people
who are really,

13:32.686 --> 13:34.480
really frustrated
with a Washington

13:34.522 --> 13:36.774
they feel has turned
its back on them.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.485
We can make sure that
every single one of us

13:39.527 --> 13:42.863
in the richest nation on
earth has enough to thrive.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.490
If your representative
won't show up

13:44.532 --> 13:47.326
and meet with you, I
will, I will show up.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.495
Those are things that
I have fought for,

13:49.537 --> 13:51.705
and those are fights
that I have led.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.999
And people want a leader
and they want someone

13:54.041 --> 13:55.167
who's gonna fight for them,

13:55.209 --> 13:56.877
and they want someone
who knows how.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.003
And I'm that person.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.298
-  Do you
ever have any doubts?

14:01.340 --> 14:01.841
- No.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.510
-  What
are the challenges

14:04.552 --> 14:05.970
that women face
running for office?

14:06.011 --> 14:06.887
I mean, I--

14:06.929 --> 14:08.013
- How much time do we have?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.559
-  If you
have a main challenge.

14:11.600 --> 14:16.313
- Well, the main
challenges, just by virtue

14:16.355 --> 14:19.358
of being female,
is that you think

14:19.400 --> 14:21.694
you're gonna be treated fairly.

14:21.735 --> 14:22.570
You're not.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.725
Thanks so much NPR.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.602
Like  what?

14:54.643 --> 14:56.061
"Underwood is in good company.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.396
"This year's unprecedented
crop of women

14:57.438 --> 14:59.064
"running for office
includes a glut of women

14:59.106 --> 15:01.233
"running in races
that, to put it mildly,

15:01.275 --> 15:03.360
"will be a challenge for
them to win in November."

15:03.402 --> 15:07.740
Like I would've never
just done this interview.

15:08.782 --> 15:09.617
You know?

15:10.993 --> 15:12.411
And then, "For now
Underwood has other things

15:12.453 --> 15:13.787
"on her mind in the long game.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.414
"She faces off against
six other candidates,

15:15.456 --> 15:17.249
"all of them men, for the
Democratic nomination.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.376
"She knows she's a strong
candidate having out-raised

15:19.418 --> 15:20.878
"all of her opponents combined,

15:20.920 --> 15:22.254
"but she does know
that if she wins

15:22.296 --> 15:24.089
"she'll have a much
tougher race to run.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.090
"We're gonna need
to raise $2 million

15:25.132 --> 15:26.425
"in the general, she says.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.426
"This will be a challenge.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.636
"We're rising to
that challenge."

15:30.095 --> 15:32.264
Fine, I'm okay with that.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.270
-  Here for CPAC
Chicago, Illinois Representative

15:38.312 --> 15:39.772
Randy Hultgren is here with us.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.106
Good to see you, sir.

15:41.148 --> 15:41.982
- Good to see you,
Cameron, thank you.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.233
- Illinois 14, tell us about it.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.276
- Yeah, just west of Chicago.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.778
Starts in the
western suburbs goes

15:45.819 --> 15:47.237
straight west across to Iowa.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.656
Great district, very diverse.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.286
-  Is this the
house you grew up in?

15:54.328 --> 15:56.121
- Yeah, this is home.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.291
The community is diverse.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.669
There's a lot of
southeast Asian, Indian

16:01.710 --> 16:04.296
and Pakistani people in
this part of Naperville.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.631
When I was growing up, I was not

16:05.673 --> 16:08.300
the only black
person in my class.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.469
So that was a good
formative experience,

16:10.511 --> 16:11.679
yet I never had a black teacher.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.347
We're gonna turn
in to the right.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.268
It's interesting.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.020
It's diverse, but it's not
like capital D diverse.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.605
It's just not.

16:30.364 --> 16:34.827
-  It's been 120 days
since Trump took office

16:34.868 --> 16:38.622
and 32 years since Joe
Barton's been in office.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.501
I'm dreaming of a world where
I can sleep through the night.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.717
- People like me don't deny
that the climate is changing.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.970
I would point out that if
you're a believer in the Bible,

16:54.096 --> 16:55.305
one would have to
say the great flood

16:55.347 --> 16:57.349
is an example of climate change.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.689
- Hi, my name is Elizabeth
and I'm volunteering

17:03.731 --> 17:05.691
with the Jana Lynne
Sanchez campaign.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.734
For the first time
in three decades,

17:07.776 --> 17:11.070
a Democrat can fight toe
to toe with a Republican

17:11.113 --> 17:13.323
in our district, District Six.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.492
I'm really excited about
the possibility of Jana

17:15.534 --> 17:17.327
representing us in Washington.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.369
Thank you.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.380
-  I never thought I
would run for office,

17:28.422 --> 17:30.507
but I saw that I
knew how to do it.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.551
We're running the most
comprehensive campaign

17:32.593 --> 17:34.553
in this district for 30 years.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.389
Nobody else has
walked as many blocks

17:37.431 --> 17:39.391
as we're walking and
we're gonna do six pieces

17:39.433 --> 17:40.893
of mail for a lot
of our audiences.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.561
Two rounds of phone calls.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.772
From everything I hear,
that's never happened before,

17:44.813 --> 17:46.190
so this will be a first.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.358
Voters are going to get
sick of hearing from us

17:48.400 --> 17:50.903
probably by the time
election day comes.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.572
Oh, hi.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.782
Good, how are you?

17:54.823 --> 17:56.742
I mean, we all know
Republicans vote in Texas

17:56.784 --> 17:57.951
and Democrats don't.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.703
I mean, that's why
we are where we are.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.581
And you know, that hopefully
is changing

18:02.623 --> 18:03.749
at least a little bit
this year.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.417
All right, I hope
you'll think about it.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.543
It's your duty to vote.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.796
It's your patriotic duty.

18:08.837 --> 18:09.588
-  All right.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.380
- Thank you.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.757
-  You're welcome.
-  All right, bye bye.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.592
Nobody enjoys campaigning.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.719
There's two, I'm going
to four down here.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.932
Hey Drew, did you get 2317?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.141
We're done with the street then.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.392
-  Yep.
- Where are we going to now?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.811
-  One street
left, Taurus.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.062
- Taurus.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.563
It's a personal beating
every single day.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.441
It is an absolute beating,
but we still have to do it.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.819
We have to do it,
we have to be there.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.071
We have to be the
agent of change.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.616
You know, in my
district no Democrat has

18:37.658 --> 18:41.078
even run a competitive
race here for 33 years.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.290
It will be a miracle if
we win on some level.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.794
-  Right
now at five o'clock,

18:48.836 --> 18:50.587
some political experts
believe a north Texas

18:50.629 --> 18:53.632
Congressional District
may now be up for grabs.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.634
Long time Republican
Congressman Joe Barton

18:55.676 --> 18:59.471
apologizing today after
a nude photo of himself

18:59.513 --> 19:01.181
has been making the
rounds on the internet.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.600
- A spokeswoman for Congress
and Joe Barton insists

19:03.642 --> 19:05.269
he is not stepping down.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.646
He has been in office
since 1985 and he has

19:07.688 --> 19:10.482
already filed to
run for reelection.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.860
It is still unclear who
posted the nude photo

19:12.901 --> 19:14.361
of Barton on the internet.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.660
- You need to get the
bottle of bleach out

19:21.702 --> 19:22.661
before you look at it,
'cause you're gonna

19:22.703 --> 19:24.454
need to pour in your eyes, yes.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.498
You can
never unsee it.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.003
My take on this has been
that if you like Barton,

19:31.044 --> 19:32.504
you see him as a victim.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.465
And that's one of the
reasons you'll notice

19:35.507 --> 19:38.677
in all of my statements, in
all of my media commentary,

19:38.719 --> 19:40.220
I have not criticized him.

19:40.262 --> 19:44.683
However, I have noticed
an extremely distinctive

19:44.725 --> 19:46.852
change in attitude
in the district.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.021
Now we're getting
real contributions.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.523
People don't understand
that this district is,

19:51.565 --> 19:54.526
it was always winnable, but
it's now extremely winnable.

19:54.568 --> 19:57.529
Either I'm gonna be
running in an open seat

19:57.571 --> 19:59.531
or I'm gonna be running
against an incumbent

19:59.573 --> 20:01.158
with a gaping hole in his head.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.375
-  Oh my god,
here's my little buddy.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.877
I'm so excited!

20:11.919 --> 20:15.047
- We took in the Liz
for Indiana frame.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.507
- Can we get our, wait,
my pictures of dogs

20:17.549 --> 20:18.717
are my favorite.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.719
A campaign isn't one person
who gets up and goes,

20:20.761 --> 20:21.929
I'm gonna run for Congress.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.389
- This will be good
for our promotion.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.724
-  This is a
really good picture.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.935
You have these people who
are just kind of a godsend,

20:27.976 --> 20:32.564
you know, who just have your
back a million times over.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.276
- Okay ready, three, two, one.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.570
- So hi, I'm Liz Watson
running for Congress

20:38.612 --> 20:40.906
in the 9th District,
and who are you?

20:40.948 --> 20:43.909
- I'm the candidate's mom.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.410
- We've been working
hard for Liz.

20:45.452 --> 20:48.580
- Gave her our firstborn,
he's working too.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.581
- Yes, our son is
working full-time.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.960
- I should say lent
our firstborn, so yeah.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.586
- Since June, he's working
full-time for her.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.547
-  This is the first
big election since 2016.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.590
And you know, it's
really important

20:58.632 --> 21:01.093
what our country says
in this election.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.306
- The Republican party's
working to suppress

21:06.348 --> 21:08.767
the vote, actively and openly.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.603
And so that, I think,
is the big picture

21:11.645 --> 21:13.230
that we're working against.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.315
You know how hard it is we
make it for people to vote.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.401
Since the 2016 election,

21:17.442 --> 21:20.112
nine states with Republican
state legislatures

21:20.153 --> 21:22.739
have passed laws
restricting the vote.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.119
-  Indiana has the
shortest voting hours

21:27.160 --> 21:28.412
in the country.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.997
There's only 12 hours,
6:00 a.m. to 6 p.m.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.331
- It closes 6:00 p.m.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.792
You know, so people who
want to come after work,

21:33.834 --> 21:35.752
you know, that's ridiculous.

21:35.794 --> 21:39.756
There's no good reason
to end at 6:00 p.m.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.594
- At this point, I'd like
othto welcome to the floorer.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.597
another freshmen of ours
from Indiana, and yield

21:47.639 --> 21:50.475
one minute to Mr.
Hollingsworth from Indiana.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.981
- Mr. Speaker, as a small
business owner myself,

21:56.023 --> 21:57.983
I understand how difficult it is

21:58.025 --> 21:59.943
to build a business
in today's economy.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.282
- It's the time
for her and for us.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.784
We have a one term
Congressman who won't

22:07.826 --> 22:09.995
even appear publicly, literally,

22:10.037 --> 22:12.456
to answer questions
or talk to people.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.832
Maybe that's part of
the goal is to just try

22:13.874 --> 22:16.293
to get people not
to pay attention.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.669
-  The worst thing
is to have people

22:17.711 --> 22:21.465
not contesting these races.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.383
When you don't contest
races, you know,

22:23.425 --> 22:26.303
you start to lose people
from the Democratic party.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.305
And I've seen that here.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.518
How was your day?

22:33.560 --> 22:34.394
- Um, pretty good.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.563
I worked on some speechy stuff,

22:38.106 --> 22:41.651
Learned about writing
speeches.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.073
- But you know, we've known
each other for 16 years.

22:46.114 --> 22:49.576
So we share a brain sometimes.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.420
saxaphone music

23:04.257 --> 23:06.718
- You gotta get Arturo in there.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.887
I'm an unlikely candidate.

23:08.929 --> 23:12.057
There are a lot of things
wrong with my pedigree.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.517
I love this.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.893
I always say it's
the only fun part

23:14.935 --> 23:16.853
about running for
office is parades.

23:23.443 --> 23:24.903
-  SÃ­, se puede!

23:24.945 --> 23:28.073
I think the best thing
that I didn't expect

23:28.115 --> 23:30.909
was the support I've had
from other women candidates.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.453
I'm in a group of
28 women candidates

23:33.495 --> 23:36.748
and we provide a support
network for each other.

23:36.790 --> 23:37.916
And that's been amazing.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.876
That's been an
amazing experience.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.922
These women are so
bright and so supportive.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.717
Oh my god!

23:47.759 --> 23:49.719
I have said it and
I will say it again.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.931
I don't believe men should
be running in this time.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.474
No, I'm really honest.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.726
I think if there's
a qualified woman

23:56.768 --> 23:59.771
in the primary, I don't
believe men should be running.

23:59.813 --> 24:03.150
- I think we are gonna
absolutely surprise people.

24:03.191 --> 24:03.942
- Blue wave.

24:03.984 --> 24:04.818
- I really do.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.950
-  I'm licensed
as a nurse.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.286
I decided to become
a nurse after having

24:14.327 --> 24:16.788
an early diagnosis
with a heart condition

24:16.830 --> 24:17.789
after third grade.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.960
And so I actually consider
running for Congress

24:22.002 --> 24:24.129
to be an extension of my
nursing practice, right?

24:24.171 --> 24:25.797
I am fighting for
our community to have

24:25.839 --> 24:30.135
the healthcare coverage
that we need, that we need.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.807
Good evening everybody,
good evening.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.811
I am overjoyed and delighted
to be here with you.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.980
Standing room only in Woodstock.

24:43.565 --> 24:48.028
And they say there's no
Democrats in McHenry County.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.322
Give me a break.

24:50.363 --> 24:54.451
37,000 people in the
Illinois 14 have healthcare

24:54.493 --> 24:56.786
coverage thanks to the
Affordable Care Act.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.789
Randy Hultgren and the
Congressional Republicans

24:59.831 --> 25:03.460
are dead set on taking
away healthcare,

25:03.502 --> 25:05.837
eliminating all the
protections that allow

25:05.879 --> 25:08.465
so many of us with
preexisting conditions

25:08.507 --> 25:11.176
to be able to have
affordable coverage.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.012
I'm a nurse and I'm also someone

25:14.054 --> 25:15.847
that has the
preexisting condition.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.016
So when folks make
promises in that area,

25:18.058 --> 25:19.851
it's personal to me.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.853
Randy Hultgren broke
his word, and I

25:21.895 --> 25:24.022
couldn't stand by
and let that happen.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.858
I knew I needed to run
for Congress against him.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.485
Because this chaos and confusion

25:28.527 --> 25:30.487
isn't working for us, is it?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.030
- No.
- No.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.991
Together, together, we will
be able to flip the 14.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.576
Thank you all.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.875
As a nurse, we were
trained to walk into

25:43.917 --> 25:47.045
a patient's room to build
that level of trust.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.004
And it's the same thing.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.422
Hi, how are you?

25:49.464 --> 25:51.216
I introduce myself on
the campaign trail.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.885
I say who I am, and I
wanna know about your life.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.012
We're gonna do it.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.055
- We are, we're gonna do it.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.056
- We have to.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.850
Hi, nice to see you, Jay.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.185
Hi Mary, how's it going?

26:03.436 --> 26:05.689
Good, thank you
for coming tonight.

26:05.730 --> 26:06.898
- Glad we could make it.

26:06.940 --> 26:07.732
- Thank you for being here.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.067
- Good luck.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.277
- We're gonna do it.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.528
We have to do it.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.612
Thank you so much.
- We will get our ballots.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.863
Okay, great, thanks.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.073
- See ya.
- Bye.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.034
-  It's
in your text messages.

26:18.076 --> 26:18.910
They're holding a parking spot

26:18.952 --> 26:20.203
for you in the front.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.086
-  I think that
our country would be

26:28.128 --> 26:30.880
a far different place
if we had more nurses

26:30.922 --> 26:33.258
and teachers, police
officers, right?

26:33.300 --> 26:36.803
More regular people
involved in our government.

26:41.683 --> 26:44.311
- If somebody had
told me four years ago

26:44.352 --> 26:46.313
I'd be running
for U.S. Congress,

26:46.354 --> 26:48.607
I would have told them
they were on drugs.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.443
-  They're
calling this a pink wave.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.945
Do you see Texas turning blue?

26:53.987 --> 26:56.281
- Texas would not be the
first state you would

26:56.323 --> 26:58.450
point to to think that
Democrats would swing it.

26:58.491 --> 27:03.663
But what you do see is the
Democrats contesting places

27:03.705 --> 27:05.915
where they haven't
normally even tried.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.459
-  I'm feeling nervous.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.960
I'm feeling good.

27:09.002 --> 27:12.297
We've accomplished
something really phenomenal

27:12.339 --> 27:13.798
by being here where we are.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.343
- Have you been
able to make it out

27:16.384 --> 27:18.178
to the polls today to
vote for Miss Watson?

27:18.219 --> 27:19.304
- I'm just calling to remind you

27:19.346 --> 27:21.097
that today is primary
day, and if you

27:21.139 --> 27:22.307
haven't voted for Liz.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.975
- Please remember
to do so today,.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.311
- The polling stops
at 6:00 p.m. tonight.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.103
- Nice to meet you.

27:27.145 --> 27:27.979
- Nice to meet you.

27:28.021 --> 27:28.980
You think I'll have your vote?

27:29.022 --> 27:30.607
- Absolutely.
- Thank you!

27:30.649 --> 27:33.151
It takes a lot of hard work
and it's building a movement.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.153
Something that's built to last.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.154
It's going good today.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.364
Nice to see you, too.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.365
- I voted for you.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.824
- Oh, I really appreciate that.

27:39.866 --> 27:40.992
Thank you so much.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.620
- Yeah, I saw you at
the forum at Wittenberg

27:43.662 --> 27:45.497
and I really liked
what you had to say.

27:45.538 --> 27:46.373
- Thanks!

27:46.414 --> 27:47.999
- You had like a bulldog spirit.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.125
-  I do.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.169
- You were gonna grab
on and you weren't

27:51.211 --> 27:52.170
gonna let it go.
- I don't let up.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.004
I hope you told lots
of your friends.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.172
- Yes I did.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.341
- Okay, good job,
much appreciated.

27:56.383 --> 28:00.011
I'm really different
from a lot of candidates.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.180
I'm a labor candidate,
but because I'm a woman,

28:02.222 --> 28:04.349
sometimes that gets obscured.

28:04.391 --> 28:07.352
Hi, Liz Watson
Democrat for Congress.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.354
It's a double-edged
sword to talk a lot

28:09.396 --> 28:10.980
about being a woman
in this district,

28:11.022 --> 28:13.650
because I will lose
five to 10% of votes

28:13.692 --> 28:14.859
over this issue, I guarantee it.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.528
It's very frustrating.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.863
- The polls are closed.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.157
Get outta here.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.367
- What am I talking
about, Brian?

28:22.409 --> 28:24.911
Is it just absentee
plus early vote, or...

28:28.248 --> 28:30.041
For my daughter, I think
it's important for her

28:30.083 --> 28:34.212
to see that women
can run and hopefully

28:34.254 --> 28:36.089
she'll see that women can win.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.056
- Did we tell you yet that
she's running for Congress?

28:45.098 --> 28:46.891
-  We need a woman
in this world, girl!

28:46.933 --> 28:47.767
- Thank you.
- Yes!

28:47.809 --> 28:48.768
Are you gonna vote today?

28:48.810 --> 28:50.061
- I did.
- You did?

28:50.103 --> 28:51.438
-  Right
before we got here.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.402
- At every place,
there was one person

28:57.444 --> 28:59.446
who knew who I was
when I walked in,

28:59.487 --> 29:01.239
which is pretty awesome.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.032
- I saw you on my Facebook.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.242
- Definitely on Facebook.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.244
We were talking to the
digital ad people last night.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.246
We were like, yeah,
we're trying to spend

29:08.288 --> 29:09.622
the whole budget
that you gave us.

29:09.664 --> 29:13.084
We were like bumping against
Facebook's spamming limits.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.420
They think that we're spamming
people, we're like, okay.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.423
- This has been like
weeks of anxiety dreams,

29:18.465 --> 29:21.050
animals chasing me,
running to catch a plane.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.260
The train has left the station.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.720
I'm like, wait!

29:23.762 --> 29:24.637
Right, like all of that.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.223
And then last night I was out.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.725
So maybe I'll get
nervous later on today,

29:28.767 --> 29:30.101
but I don't think so.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.269
I'm feeling--
- Your body's telling you,

29:31.311 --> 29:32.437
look you've done the work.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.730
- We've done it.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.106
- You know, I think
back to November 2016,

29:35.148 --> 29:37.275
which I just still think
couldn't even think

29:37.317 --> 29:39.903
about at that time,
but it comes down to,

29:39.944 --> 29:42.947
this is about not only
daughter, but also my son.

29:42.989 --> 29:43.782
-  Mm-hmm.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.143
- I am so excited.

30:12.185 --> 30:16.981
This is the oddest feeling,
but just, we did it.

30:17.023 --> 30:20.485
I saved my position for
last to fill in the bubbles.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.487
I made sure I did
everything else.

30:22.529 --> 30:25.990
And then I took a deep breath
and filled in my own name.

30:26.032 --> 30:26.866
I feel really good.

30:26.908 --> 30:27.992
Thank you.
- Yep.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.828
- Bye!

30:37.710 --> 30:38.837
- 'Kay, see you later.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.679
-  I think Katie
is getting me a pen.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.682
- Maybe I'll put this
back here.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.353
- I'm so thrilled to be
the Democratic nominee

30:55.395 --> 30:56.354
for Congress from our district.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.730
This might not happen.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.524
We all know this, but you
just have to get ready.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.025
We did this together.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.404
Thank you.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.532
Uh, what am I doing right now?

31:07.574 --> 31:08.741
Okay.

31:08.783 --> 31:11.327
It's so wonderful that
we had so many Democrats

31:11.369 --> 31:13.913
running strong,
robust campaigns.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.583
It shows that we have the
strength to come together,

31:16.624 --> 31:21.588
come together and
beat Trey in November.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.176
No, I can't drink before I talk.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.344
It's always a bad idea.

31:30.221 --> 31:31.389
I've learned that.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.557
- It only happened
once.

31:32.599 --> 31:33.766
- No, I've done it
on three occasions

31:33.808 --> 31:36.394
and every single time
it did not work out.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.409
- You know you did
a lot of the work

31:51.451 --> 31:53.411
that's gonna make this
possible in November.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.122
So I mean all credit
to you and thank you.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.418
I think you and I stand
for the same thing.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.753
We're just in this
for the right reasons

32:01.794 --> 32:03.880
and all right, yeah.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.797
Thanks Dan.

32:04.839 --> 32:05.423
Okay, thanks for calling.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.299
Okay, bye bye.

32:07.425 --> 32:08.968
So are we?

32:09.010 --> 32:12.430
- Yeah, I'm gonna have
more for you later, but--

32:12.472 --> 32:14.641
- So am I gonna, I'm gonna okay.

32:14.682 --> 32:15.934
- Yeah, yeah.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.569
-  Liz,
Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz!

32:36.454 --> 32:41.417
- I am so thrilled and
honored to be the Democratic

32:41.459 --> 32:44.671
nominee to take on
Trey Hollingsworth.

32:49.842 --> 32:52.679
I know I just
introduced my family,

32:52.720 --> 32:57.266
but you know, I really,
Craig, I gotta hand it to you.

32:57.308 --> 33:00.478
You believed and
you got behind me,

33:00.520 --> 33:03.481
I mean, a thousand percent.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.949
But I want to be really
clear about the fact

33:12.991 --> 33:14.492
that we all did this together.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.703
It's because of each
and every one of you

33:16.744 --> 33:20.289
who are here in this room,
who knocked on doors.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.333
And I know a lot of people
are probably thinking

33:22.375 --> 33:24.043
finally, I get to sit down.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.129
There is a crew
of people here who

33:26.170 --> 33:28.047
I don't think slept last night.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.883
Thank you, thank you
for what you did.

33:30.925 --> 33:33.344
So this is a really
exciting moment.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.846
And it's a really
important moment,

33:34.887 --> 33:37.348
because everything we care about

33:37.390 --> 33:39.142
right now is at stake.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.352
Everything is on the line.

33:45.106 --> 33:48.317
-  Lauren,
Lauren, Lauren, Lauren!

33:48.359 --> 33:50.820
Lauren, Lauren, Lauren, Lauren!

34:02.582 --> 34:03.374
Thank you.

34:07.420 --> 34:10.089
- We earned every single
vote we got tonight.

34:10.130 --> 34:14.385
We did not need name
ID in order to win.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.763
We won one vote at a time.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.391
We are releasing a
press release as well.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.393
What is your deadline?

34:24.562 --> 34:25.730
- Everybody, can I
have your attention?

34:25.772 --> 34:28.107
Just real quick!

34:28.149 --> 34:30.735
Jana would like to
say a few words.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.737
- We started from nowhere.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.572
We had zero name ID.

34:35.614 --> 34:38.409
We just had an
idea, which is that

34:38.451 --> 34:41.579
Democrats could
win this district.

34:41.621 --> 34:42.580
- Absolutely.
- Yeah!

34:42.621 --> 34:47.585
- And we have proved tonight

34:48.460 --> 34:49.587
that we are on our way.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.599
A lady on Facebook
messaged me and said,

35:01.641 --> 35:03.142
"I'm gonna make you a sash."

35:03.184 --> 35:04.936
I think it's like this.

35:04.977 --> 35:07.438
And I love it, but
I've never worn it

35:07.480 --> 35:08.773
because I feel a little bit like

35:08.815 --> 35:12.777
I'm pretending to be a
beauty pageant contestant.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.904
I don't, votes for.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.782
Maybe it should say
vote for Jana Lynne?

35:17.824 --> 35:19.450
But it says votes
for Jana Lynne.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.452
I'm gonna wear it tonight.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.954
So I'm gonna wear it tonight

35:22.995 --> 35:25.623
for the victory party
or the watch party

35:25.665 --> 35:26.624
as we're calling it.

35:26.666 --> 35:27.917
I hope
it's a victory party.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.295
-  How many more
hours until the polls close?

35:31.337 --> 35:33.798
- Uh, what time is
it now, it's 4:30?

35:33.840 --> 35:35.675
So, um two and a half.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.094
I'm feeling nervous.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.429
I have no idea how
it's gonna go tonight.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.306
I think it's gonna be close.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.309
Data is really helpful.

35:45.351 --> 35:48.020
The more data I have,
the more I calm down.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.648
I just always want to
know how we're doing

35:50.690 --> 35:53.860
based on empirical evidence.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.868
- I'm Shelly Poplar from the
"Fort Worth Star Telegram."

36:01.909 --> 36:04.495
The polls have been closed
now for a little over an hour.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.622
And in Congressional
District Six,

36:06.664 --> 36:09.667
this is Joe Barton's
seat, Jana Lynne Sanchez

36:09.709 --> 36:11.210
has taken an early lead.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.670
Let's look at the numbers here.

36:12.712 --> 36:13.671
I know they're fluid.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.882
- So far, we're
four points ahead.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.884
It's 52 to 48.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.845
We were expecting to be
a bit behind right now,

36:20.887 --> 36:22.680
but it's only about 250 votes.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.473
So we can't get too excited.

36:24.515 --> 36:25.349
So we could still lose.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.018
That could still happen.

36:27.059 --> 36:28.227
I feel good.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.480
I feel really relieved
and optimistic.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.857
-  The last
time you were here.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.358
-  And how many Tarrant
County precincts was that?

36:34.400 --> 36:35.526
-  That was 50.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.028
- 50 out of a 100.
- 50?

36:37.069 --> 36:38.529
-  We got 182, yeah.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.655
- I'm winning.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.703
-  We've already
counted most of the--

36:45.745 --> 36:47.163
- They called it!
- They called it!

36:58.216 --> 37:00.718
- We won!

37:00.760 --> 37:01.552
We won!

37:16.943 --> 37:18.527
- Female candidates for office

37:18.569 --> 37:20.738
are featured on
"Time's" latest cover.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.074
The magazine calls
them the Avengers.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.909
Joining me now is
Lauren Underwood.

37:24.951 --> 37:27.203
She's running for a
congressional seat in Illinois

37:27.245 --> 37:30.248
against Republican
incumbent, Randy Hultgren.

37:31.791 --> 37:35.586
So Lauren, I have to ask,
what made you want to run?

37:35.628 --> 37:38.756
-  In our district, we
have 37,000 people who currently

37:38.798 --> 37:41.926
are insured through the
Obamacare marketplaces.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.594
And so they're looking
for some stability,

37:43.636 --> 37:45.596
but also to make sure
that it's affordable

37:45.638 --> 37:46.931
for middle-class families.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.933
- In politics now, you
can tell it's an election

37:48.975 --> 37:51.435
that's tight as can be
because the allegations

37:51.477 --> 37:53.938
are heating up in the 14th
Congressional District.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.732
Congressman Randy Hultgren
is facing a stiff challenge

37:56.774 --> 37:59.110
from political newcomer,
Lauren Underwood.

37:59.151 --> 38:00.778
-  Our district, the
Illinois 14th, has not had

38:00.820 --> 38:03.781
a competitive Congressional
race in 10 years.

38:03.823 --> 38:07.618
My opponent has not had a
primary challenger ever.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.578
- There's been so
much about healthcare.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.789
Where do you stand on
preexisting conditions?

38:11.831 --> 38:12.790
Because that seems to be--

38:12.832 --> 38:14.166
- Yeah, somehow
is must have been

38:14.208 --> 38:15.626
like a nationwide
poll that they did

38:15.668 --> 38:17.962
and they picked this out,
'cause it's just not true.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.464
-  We have special
interest dollars that are

38:20.506 --> 38:23.634
getting ready to flood in that
want to drown out my voice.

38:23.676 --> 38:27.346
They are so threatened
by my candidacy.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.765
The battleground,
if you will,

38:29.807 --> 38:33.477
is in suburban Midwestern
districts like mine.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.773
- We are in a red, red,
red part of Illinois.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.818
Yeah, this is not an
area that Democrats

38:40.860 --> 38:43.362
have usually thought
we could play in.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.656
And yet here is this

38:45.698 --> 38:48.659
fantastic African American

38:48.701 --> 38:50.786
vibrant young
leader, who's I think

38:50.828 --> 38:53.831
caught the imagination
of everybody up here,

38:53.873 --> 38:54.832
-  Such an opportunity.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.293
We've had tens of
thousands of people

38:57.335 --> 39:00.796
invest in this race and
say, "I have your back."

39:00.838 --> 39:02.465
Hi everyone, it's
Lauren Underwood.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.800
I'm so thrilled to be
here with my friend,

39:04.842 --> 39:06.802
Mayor Pete from
South Bend, Indiana.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.512
We're here to talk early voting.

39:08.554 --> 39:11.682
I'm here on our 100th
day until the election.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.685
So excited about this
group, this team.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.687
We know that we're
gonna be victorious

39:16.729 --> 39:17.813
come November 6th.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.692
We can win but we're
not winning yet.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.737
We can't shirk away,
we've gotta dig in.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.532
- For our Democracy
2018 coverage

39:28.574 --> 39:30.659
focused on bringing
you all of Indiana's

39:30.701 --> 39:33.871
most pivotal races in the
upcoming midterm election.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.499
Today we travel to the 9th
Congressional District.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.250
Incumbent Republican
Trey Hollingsworth

39:38.292 --> 39:41.504
is being challenged by
Democrat, Liz Watson.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.047
-  Watson is
from Bloomington where she

39:43.089 --> 39:45.216
resides with her husband
and two children.

39:46.759 --> 39:47.885
-  What's
it been like, Lila,

39:47.927 --> 39:50.721
to see your mom running
for this office?

39:50.763 --> 39:52.681
- Well, at first I
was like, oh my god,

39:52.723 --> 39:56.018
like I have never done
anything so brave before.

39:56.435 --> 40:00.231
And the day that we won the
primary, I was like,

40:00.272 --> 40:02.733
oh my god, we could
actually win this.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.736
- Lila tells it like it is.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.697
-  What's
been hard about this year,

40:08.739 --> 40:09.740
having your mom run?

40:14.412 --> 40:19.417
- It's mostly that I always
have something on my mind.

40:20.626 --> 40:23.129
Oh my god, what if
we don't win this?

40:23.170 --> 40:24.296
Or--

40:24.338 --> 40:25.923
- I mean, we wanna win.

40:25.965 --> 40:30.928
But we we talked
about that, we said

40:30.970 --> 40:31.929
we'd made peace
with every outcome

40:31.971 --> 40:33.931
before we started
running, right?

40:33.973 --> 40:35.933
- Yep.
- Yeah.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.143
And that it's gonna
be important that we

40:37.184 --> 40:40.312
ran a campaign that was
based on actually trying

40:40.354 --> 40:42.481
to fight for people, right?

40:42.523 --> 40:43.899
-  Mm-hmm.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.610
- Yeah, so whatever happens
we've done a pretty good thing.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.788
So we've elected a Congress
full of millionaires

40:57.830 --> 40:59.957
who have no idea
what real people face

40:59.999 --> 41:01.917
and no idea how
hard people work,

41:03.544 --> 41:06.964
and how close to the edge so
many people here are living.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.930
- Yeah.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.975
I think that one of
the reasons that I've

41:18.017 --> 41:20.978
kind of taken to being able
to run a strong campaign

41:21.020 --> 41:23.939
is that I can have this
really singular focus.

41:25.816 --> 41:28.986
You know, when you sort
of go 150 miles an hour

41:29.028 --> 41:32.490
for a year and that's
just what it takes.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.993
I mean, I had no idea
about the fundraising.

41:36.035 --> 41:37.620
It is nuts.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.330
I mean, we've raised over
$2 million in this campaign.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.332
Like how does one do that?

41:42.374 --> 41:43.626
The hard part about that, right,

41:43.667 --> 41:48.005
is my opponent has a
$58 million net worth.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.173
I do not.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.841
In a district where
your opponent spent

41:50.883 --> 41:53.010
$4 1/2 million putting
his name out there

41:53.052 --> 41:56.680
in paid advertising to win
the seat the first time.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.807
Getting out there so
that people know who I am

41:58.849 --> 42:00.142
is really important.

42:02.686 --> 42:03.854
I mean, we all wish
we could run campaigns

42:03.896 --> 42:05.231
without money, but you can't.

42:05.272 --> 42:08.484
So I've had to spend a
stupid amount of time

42:08.526 --> 42:11.028
raising money, I mean, just
a stupid amount of time.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.863
You know, we have a system
where someone like me,

42:12.905 --> 42:14.490
that isn't gonna take
corporate PAC money,

42:14.532 --> 42:17.493
and doesn't have their
own fat bank account,

42:17.535 --> 42:20.871
is just gonna be on
the phone all the time,

42:20.913 --> 42:22.414
you know, trying to raise money.

42:22.456 --> 42:25.042
So when you go up against
somebody that doesn't

42:25.084 --> 42:27.044
have to spend any
time raising money,

42:27.086 --> 42:28.879
it's just an unequal
playing field.

42:30.089 --> 42:33.050
He has been running
digital attack ads.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.510
He's found all my bad hair days.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.512
I have so many to choose from,

42:37.263 --> 42:38.514
so many bad hair days.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.224
And then he kind of
paints my hair blue.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.517
It's
very interesting.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.227
-  Liberal
lobbyist, Liz Watson,

42:43.269 --> 42:45.062
spent a decade in Washington.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.398
She'd raise taxes,
open our borders,

42:47.439 --> 42:49.066
take over your healthcare.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.693
She won't fix the problem.

42:50.734 --> 42:53.696
Liberal lobbyist
Liz is the problem.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.282
- I'm Trey Hollingsworth
and I approve this message.

42:56.323 --> 42:58.534
- Liberal Liz thinks people
should have healthcare.

43:01.453 --> 43:04.081
All the things that
are in every campaign,

43:04.123 --> 43:07.084
the name calling and the
lying and the whatever,

43:07.126 --> 43:11.714
it's all fear-mongering,
I mean, you know.

43:11.755 --> 43:12.464
I really appreciate it.

43:12.506 --> 43:13.632
- Yeah, I hope you--

43:13.674 --> 43:15.259
- It's all based on fear.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.428
You just have to
stay on your message

43:17.469 --> 43:21.098
and just don't give
it any airtime.

43:21.140 --> 43:22.766
Just stay on your message.

43:23.183 --> 43:28.147
orchestral string music

43:37.156 --> 43:40.284
- I'm so happy to be
back here in my hometown

43:40.326 --> 43:42.953
and particularly
happy to be surrounded

43:42.995 --> 43:46.790
by so many amazing, active,

43:46.832 --> 43:49.960
powerful Democratic women.

43:54.173 --> 43:57.134
So you know we've all heard,
we've been hearing it,

43:57.176 --> 43:59.345
this is the year of the woman.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.471
How many of y'all
have heard that?

44:02.181 --> 44:03.974
You watched us on
the Women's March.

44:04.016 --> 44:06.143
They've taken note of
the fact that we have

44:06.185 --> 44:10.022
more women running
than ever before.

44:11.523 --> 44:14.693
But sometimes I worry
about those labels,

44:14.735 --> 44:18.155
the year of the woman.

44:18.197 --> 44:21.700
Because I want this to
be more than a year.

44:23.202 --> 44:26.121
I want this to be
the beginning of us

44:26.163 --> 44:30.000
making sure that we are
no longer on the menu

44:30.042 --> 44:32.836
because we are at the table.

44:35.047 --> 44:37.132
It's with great pride
and pleasure that I

44:37.174 --> 44:42.179
introduce to you, our Texas
Congressional candidates.

44:43.889 --> 44:46.850
With us today, Jana
Lynne Sanchez running

44:46.892 --> 44:51.897
in Congressional District Six.

44:52.564 --> 44:53.982
- Hi, how are you doing?

44:54.024 --> 44:55.150
- I'm doing well,
I'm doing well.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.568
-  Oh, good to see you.

44:56.610 --> 44:57.861
Are you out walking?

44:57.903 --> 44:59.571
Are you knocking
on doors, oh yeah.

44:59.613 --> 45:00.364
- Love your emails.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.657
- Thank you.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.534
Thank you.

45:03.575 --> 45:05.160
I think people thought
we were in the way,

45:05.202 --> 45:07.162
but we're in the
way wherever we are.

45:07.204 --> 45:10.040
- I's not the first time
we've stopped traffic.

45:12.459 --> 45:14.211
- Okay, can we find
a place to sit down?

45:14.253 --> 45:17.005
'Cause my feet are killing me.
- Absolutely.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.549
- My girls would
be so disappointed.

45:18.590 --> 45:21.552
They were so excited when
they saw I wore a suit today.

45:21.593 --> 45:23.053
- You can go back.

45:23.095 --> 45:25.180
You can go back,
just taking a break.

45:28.475 --> 45:29.393
-  Am I nervous?

45:29.435 --> 45:30.227
Not right now.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.229
-  Have
you been nervous

45:32.271 --> 45:33.689
throughout the campaign?

45:33.731 --> 45:35.065
- I've been nervous for sure.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.066
Debates?

45:36.108 --> 45:37.568
The first debate
I did with Randy,

45:37.609 --> 45:40.237
well the first forum
editorial board meeting

45:40.279 --> 45:42.406
at the "Chicago
Tribune," I could barely

45:42.448 --> 45:45.200
string together a
coherent sentence.

45:45.242 --> 45:46.452
I'm serious.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.745
I don't know what
came over my body.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.790
-  All right,
Mr. Hultgren, what's an issue

45:51.832 --> 45:53.917
that you agree with
your opponent on?

45:53.959 --> 45:56.044
- Well, I think we
agree, for example,

45:56.086 --> 45:58.255
on the threat that Russia poses.

45:58.297 --> 46:00.716
And it also means that we
need to make sure that,

46:00.758 --> 46:04.094
just as citizens ourselves,
consumers of information,

46:04.136 --> 46:06.430
we need to not only vote,
not only participate,

46:06.472 --> 46:08.056
but make sure that we're
getting information

46:08.098 --> 46:09.892
from a lot of different sources.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.059
All of those things
are important

46:11.101 --> 46:13.103
to make our
elections meaningful.

46:13.145 --> 46:15.272
There could be nothing
more important than that.

46:15.314 --> 46:17.274
- I'm very concerned
with the threat

46:17.316 --> 46:19.067
that foreign
interference will play

46:19.109 --> 46:20.611
in our upcoming
midterm election.

46:20.652 --> 46:24.114
We know that in 2018,
candidates have already

46:24.156 --> 46:27.117
experienced foreign
hacking and infiltration

46:27.159 --> 46:29.077
of their internal
campaign systems, and so--

46:29.119 --> 46:30.454
- Is your campaign one of those?

46:30.496 --> 46:32.080
- My campaign is
not one of those.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.750
- We do agree there is
nothing more important

46:34.792 --> 46:36.084
and nothing more sacred.

46:36.126 --> 46:37.294
Let's just make
sure that we do it

46:37.336 --> 46:39.087
in a measured way
and make sure that we

46:39.129 --> 46:40.297
do it in a prudent way.

46:40.339 --> 46:42.299
- We have children in
cages at the border.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.092
We need to investigate that.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.512
If we are going to be serious
about healthcare reform,

46:46.553 --> 46:48.138
we need to bring in the voices

46:48.180 --> 46:49.515
of patients and families.

46:49.556 --> 46:51.850
If we have, like we
saw earlier this year,

46:51.892 --> 46:54.520
every other day a mass
shooting in this country,

46:54.561 --> 46:56.480
we need to put
forward common sense

46:56.522 --> 46:58.982
gun reform solutions
that would allow

46:59.024 --> 47:01.151
for the safety and security
of our communities.

47:01.193 --> 47:03.278
This Congress has been
unwilling to do that

47:03.320 --> 47:06.323
and has been unwilling
to offer that much needed

47:06.365 --> 47:08.450
check and balance
over President Trump.

47:09.576 --> 47:10.869
This is high stakes.

47:10.911 --> 47:14.331
We are literally one
of the must win seats.

47:14.373 --> 47:16.542
This is a tier one race.

47:16.583 --> 47:19.378
Doesn't get more competitive
than what we're doing now.

47:20.587 --> 47:22.005
- We're honored to
be joined tonight

47:22.047 --> 47:24.508
by Congressman Randy Hultgren.

47:25.551 --> 47:26.343
Come on up.

47:32.558 --> 47:34.184
- Thank you, Mr. President.

47:34.226 --> 47:35.185
God bless you all.

47:35.227 --> 47:36.186
This is amazing.

47:36.228 --> 47:37.187
We need your vote.

47:37.229 --> 47:38.188
My name is Randy Hultgren.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.815
I represent the
northern suburbs.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.525
We've got a tough
battle running against

47:41.567 --> 47:43.902
a very liberal who
absolutely is dying

47:43.944 --> 47:45.988
to support Nancy
Pelosi for Speaker.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.364
We've gotta stop that.

47:47.406 --> 47:48.699
We gotta hold the House.

47:48.740 --> 47:50.826
We gotta continue to fight
for this great country.

47:50.868 --> 47:51.743
God bless you all.

47:51.785 --> 47:53.036
Get out and vote, vote early.

47:53.078 --> 47:56.582
Thank you.

47:56.623 --> 48:00.711
- I have 49 days
to what feels like

48:00.752 --> 48:02.254
take down an institution.

48:04.590 --> 48:06.216
- Now Indiana, I
heard a rumor that I

48:06.258 --> 48:08.218
don't wanna believe is true.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.220
But I heard you guys ranked 50th

48:10.262 --> 48:11.847
when it comes to voting.

48:13.432 --> 48:17.060
So we gotta change that, and
that change starts today.

48:19.271 --> 48:20.606
- In case you haven't noticed,

48:20.647 --> 48:22.357
there are a lot of
people here today.

48:24.985 --> 48:30.073
And we are here for the
very important purpose

48:30.282 --> 48:33.869
of electing Liz Watson as
the next Congressperson

48:33.911 --> 48:36.413
from this district.

48:36.455 --> 48:37.414
Thank you all.

48:40.125 --> 48:42.544
Okay, kid, all yours.

48:43.670 --> 48:47.090
- The election in just
a couple of short weeks

48:47.132 --> 48:50.218
on November 6th is
the most important

48:50.260 --> 48:52.220
election of our lifetime.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.388
Let's get to work.

48:53.430 --> 48:57.267
Let's take our place
in history, let's vote.

48:57.309 --> 49:01.438
Thank you.

49:01.480 --> 49:02.439
- My name is Joe Biden.

49:05.484 --> 49:08.445
And I'm here for
my friend, Lauren.

49:11.323 --> 49:13.784
When we listened
to Lauren speak.

49:13.825 --> 49:16.286
I was of reminded
a couple things.

49:16.328 --> 49:20.999
We have more women running
for high public office

49:21.041 --> 49:22.918
in any time in American history.

49:25.837 --> 49:27.464
- We deserve a
representative who will be

49:27.506 --> 49:29.925
transparent and really listen.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.844
And Randy Hultgren does
not do that for us.

49:34.179 --> 49:36.431
Now, now, don't boo, don't!

49:46.692 --> 49:48.276
- 28 days out.

49:48.318 --> 49:51.321
We have four weeks exactly
to win this election,

49:51.363 --> 49:54.366
and we have a lot of work to do.

50:03.875 --> 50:05.669
The fact that the
Democrat party has not

50:05.711 --> 50:09.339
supported us is very upsetting,

50:09.381 --> 50:12.050
because I think with even
a little bit of support

50:12.092 --> 50:14.511
from the DCCC, we
could have raised

50:14.553 --> 50:16.471
twice as much money
as we've raised.

50:17.347 --> 50:18.348
But we're just plugging away.

50:18.390 --> 50:20.684
We have so much left to do.

50:20.726 --> 50:22.352
We've had some big breaks.

50:22.394 --> 50:25.063
We got the endorsement of
the "Dallas Morning News."

50:25.105 --> 50:28.066
That is the first
time in 35 years

50:28.108 --> 50:30.694
that the paper has
endorsed a Democrat.

50:30.736 --> 50:33.363
People start saying,
"When you win."

50:33.405 --> 50:34.906
And I can't accept that.

50:34.948 --> 50:37.534
I feel like you can't
assume that you're gonna

50:37.576 --> 50:39.703
win anything, especially
in a district like this.

50:39.745 --> 50:42.873
We just have to make it happen,
really through hard work.

50:50.589 --> 50:52.174
- A thing that I've
always enjoyed doing,

50:52.215 --> 50:53.550
and that I just
kinda let myself do,

50:53.592 --> 50:57.387
is I love to talk to people
and hear their stories.

50:57.429 --> 51:00.515
I get to talk to
people about the most

51:00.557 --> 51:04.394
serious and sometimes crushing
things in their lives.

51:04.436 --> 51:06.772
- Healthcare is a major,
major,

51:06.813 --> 51:08.106
major league concern
for us.

51:08.148 --> 51:09.232
- Okay, okay, tell
me about that.

51:09.274 --> 51:10.734
- Especially preexisting
conditions.

51:10.776 --> 51:13.236
-  Yeah.
I'm a breast cancer survivor,

51:14.571 --> 51:19.576
and that really worries me
that right now I'm covered,

51:19.618 --> 51:23.413
you know, but who knows about
next year or the year after.

51:23.455 --> 51:25.415
So that's kind of frightening.

51:26.291 --> 51:27.584
-  Every time there's
an election

51:27.626 --> 51:29.586
somebody says it's the
most important election

51:29.628 --> 51:31.588
of our lifetime,
but this is a time

51:31.630 --> 51:35.300
when nobody disagrees with
you when you say that.

51:36.843 --> 51:39.763
- This administration
that's in office right now

51:39.805 --> 51:42.599
and the rhetoric,
there's just hate.

51:42.641 --> 51:47.604
It's breeding this,
fueling this hate,

51:47.646 --> 51:51.775
this underlying hate, I
guess, that's been there.

51:51.817 --> 51:56.154
It's not doing anything
to mitigate it.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.447
- People don't
want you to dig in

51:57.489 --> 51:59.282
on a complicated policy answer.

51:59.324 --> 52:01.118
They want you to dig
in on what's real.

52:01.493 --> 52:02.619
You know.

52:02.661 --> 52:04.621
The most important
conversations come from

52:04.663 --> 52:06.123
those kinds of connections.

52:08.125 --> 52:10.460
One of the things
that I worry about

52:10.502 --> 52:14.631
is that our party
affiliation right now,

52:14.673 --> 52:17.175
it's almost like a religion.

52:17.217 --> 52:21.471
So regardless of whether
the person in office

52:21.513 --> 52:24.474
is clearly ripping you off,

52:24.516 --> 52:25.642
you're willing to
vote for that person

52:25.684 --> 52:28.854
just because they have
an R behind their name.

52:31.690 --> 52:33.483
Here in Indiana,
yes, we need to bring

52:33.525 --> 52:34.484
Democrats to the polls.

52:34.526 --> 52:36.444
But we only win if we also win

52:36.486 --> 52:38.113
Independent and
Republican votes.

52:39.865 --> 52:42.659
And I hope that we'll
have enough people

52:42.701 --> 52:45.036
who see through and see
that actually, you know,

52:45.078 --> 52:47.831
you ought to vote
for the person,

52:47.873 --> 52:50.167
the person who's actually
gonna fight for you.

52:52.711 --> 52:56.548
And that's what we'll
see in this election.

53:01.052 --> 53:02.679
-  A
record number of women

53:02.721 --> 53:05.515
are running for office this
year, including nearly 500

53:05.557 --> 53:08.185
who have their sights set
on the nation's Capitol.

53:21.573 --> 53:22.991
- Good morning!

53:24.576 --> 53:25.994
Okay.

53:26.286 --> 53:27.913
- Oh, hold on.

53:27.954 --> 53:28.830
Thank you!

53:29.623 --> 53:34.711
gentle piano music

53:34.753 --> 53:35.921
-  Good, how are you?

53:35.962 --> 53:38.715
Good, sorry, I
know it's raining.

54:13.750 --> 54:16.753
Whoo!

54:16.795 --> 54:18.922
- People that look
around their community

54:18.964 --> 54:23.969
and see a need can take action
and do something tremendous.

54:24.803 --> 54:26.972
My grandmother, when she was 95,

54:27.013 --> 54:28.974
she was telling me the
story about the school house

54:29.015 --> 54:30.767
that she went to
as a little girl,

54:30.809 --> 54:33.103
and how that school
house was purchased by

54:33.144 --> 54:35.438
three African American
men three years

54:35.480 --> 54:36.773
after the end of slavery.

54:36.815 --> 54:38.608
And I said, how could
that be, just three years

54:38.650 --> 54:40.735
after the end of
slavery, that those men

54:40.777 --> 54:44.322
had the resources and the
wherewithal to buy land,

54:44.364 --> 54:46.783
build a school house
and have the gall

54:46.825 --> 54:48.410
to put on the side
of it that they

54:48.451 --> 54:50.662
were educating black
children there.

54:51.830 --> 54:54.833
My grandmother stopped
me short and she said,

54:56.293 --> 54:59.129
"Jason, those black children
didn't have a school.

54:59.170 --> 55:00.755
"They needed a school house."

55:01.840 --> 55:03.800
The people of that
community looked around

55:03.842 --> 55:05.468
and they saw that need,

55:06.803 --> 55:09.848
and they were
doers, and doers do.

55:11.683 --> 55:14.978
So I'm so happy that
Lauren has been a spark

55:15.020 --> 55:16.479
and that you've been the fire.

55:16.521 --> 55:18.273
So please join me
as we're about to

55:18.315 --> 55:20.608
take on these doors, let's
clap it up for each other,

55:20.650 --> 55:23.028
to be those doers that are
gonna bring the change.

55:23.069 --> 55:24.154
Okay, let's do it!

55:25.697 --> 55:27.365
Today's the day!

55:27.407 --> 55:28.867
- Today's the day!

55:34.873 --> 55:37.167
Welcome to our office!

55:37.208 --> 55:38.835
We're on an Airstream tour.

55:38.877 --> 55:41.838
I decided that, you know,
let's take it old school,

55:41.880 --> 55:43.798
go around the
district in a way that

55:43.840 --> 55:46.051
brings people to us or at
least can welcome them in.

55:46.092 --> 55:46.843
You wanna come in?

55:46.885 --> 55:47.677
- Let's check it out.

55:47.719 --> 55:49.179
- Yeah, check it out.

55:49.220 --> 55:50.847
Had like big Lauren
Underwood for Congress signs,

55:50.889 --> 55:53.016
we take pictures in
front, invite people in.

55:53.058 --> 55:55.393
We've been going to every
County in the District

55:55.435 --> 55:56.811
over the course of
the final three days

55:56.853 --> 55:59.856
of get out the vote, and
having pop-up events.

55:59.898 --> 56:00.690
- We're going to breakfast now.

56:00.732 --> 56:01.858
- Going to breakfast.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.527
To remind people that
the representative

56:04.569 --> 56:06.071
is supposed to show up.

56:06.112 --> 56:07.030
- You ready to roll?

56:07.072 --> 56:07.822
-  Ready.

56:07.864 --> 56:08.698
- Let's do it.

56:08.907 --> 56:13.078
acoustic guitar music

56:13.119 --> 56:14.704
- Hi.
- Hello!

56:14.746 --> 56:15.830
Yes!

56:17.457 --> 56:18.708
Thank you so much.

56:18.750 --> 56:19.709
-  Next Congresswoman.

56:19.751 --> 56:20.668
- Hi, Lauren.

56:20.710 --> 56:21.419
I'm so happy.

56:21.461 --> 56:22.420
- Nice to meet you!

56:22.462 --> 56:23.671
- There I go.
- Thank you.

56:23.713 --> 56:25.507
I love that, thank
you for your support.

56:25.548 --> 56:26.341
Okay, we have to fist bump.

56:26.383 --> 56:28.718
Fist bump, thank you.

56:28.760 --> 56:31.221
-  Underwood,
Underwood, Underwood.

56:31.262 --> 56:32.097
- Okay.

56:35.100 --> 56:36.726
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you.

56:36.768 --> 56:38.061
- Thank you!
- Good to meet you!

56:38.103 --> 56:39.354
- Good to meet you too.

56:39.396 --> 56:39.896
- So Mitch, you have
to make me a promise.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.106
- Yes.

56:41.147 --> 56:42.732
- When you grow up
and you see something

56:42.774 --> 56:45.527
happen in your community
and you know it's not right,

56:45.568 --> 56:47.904
then you step up on day two.

56:47.946 --> 56:48.905
- Yes.
- You promise?

56:48.947 --> 56:50.073
- Yes.

56:50.115 --> 56:51.282
- Thank you.

56:51.324 --> 56:52.909
- Thank you, it was
very nice to meet you.

56:52.951 --> 56:53.868
- Of course, nice to meet you.

56:53.910 --> 56:54.911
- God, we thank you for today,

56:54.953 --> 56:56.121
we thank you for the food.

56:56.162 --> 56:57.914
We thank you for the
opportunity to be here.

56:57.956 --> 56:59.874
We ask for you to
continue to watch over us

56:59.916 --> 57:02.252
as you remind us to
serve the least of these.

57:02.293 --> 57:04.587
You have called us for
a time such as this.

57:04.629 --> 57:06.714
And you have called your
daughter, Lauren Underwood,

57:06.756 --> 57:08.383
right now to serve the people.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.301
We know that she is
ready for this moment.

57:10.343 --> 57:12.262
So we reflect and we say,
thank you in advance.

57:12.303 --> 57:13.596
Thank you for the opportunity.

57:13.638 --> 57:14.931
Thank you for family,
thank you for friends.

57:14.973 --> 57:16.766
Today shall be the
ultimate victory.

57:16.808 --> 57:18.768
In the name of the
Father who created

57:18.810 --> 57:20.270
the heaven, the moon,
the sun, and the stars.

57:20.311 --> 57:22.730
In the name of the Son
that went up on Mt. Calvary

57:22.772 --> 57:23.940
to give us chance
for life everlasting.

57:23.982 --> 57:26.317
In the name of the Holy
Spirit, we say amen.

57:26.359 --> 57:27.402
-  Amen!

57:29.154 --> 57:30.321
- Amen!
- Okay!

57:32.365 --> 57:34.951
-  I have all my friends
here from just life.

57:34.993 --> 57:36.286
Not just D.C.

57:36.327 --> 57:38.913
It's really special to
be able to share my home,

57:38.955 --> 57:40.415
my community with people.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.916
Thanks for coming,
how are you doing?

57:41.958 --> 57:44.335
Very rarely do you get to
see where someone's from.

57:53.011 --> 57:54.179
- I'm just so excited for you.

57:55.847 --> 57:57.765
- Thank you for being
here, seriously.

57:57.807 --> 57:58.808
- Thank you for having me here.

57:58.850 --> 58:00.977
- Seriously, I love you so much.

58:01.019 --> 58:02.604
- I love you.

58:02.645 --> 58:03.938
- My friends know the
true desires of my heart,

58:03.980 --> 58:05.148
which is to serve.

58:05.190 --> 58:06.983
And they know that
I really care.

58:07.025 --> 58:10.778
And they have been
literally supportive

58:10.820 --> 58:12.947
in every way that they could
along this whole journey.

58:12.989 --> 58:15.825
- All right, oh this
is, oh, this is good!

58:15.867 --> 58:17.827
-  They're here
because they care,

58:17.869 --> 58:19.829
and because we're real friends

58:19.871 --> 58:21.831
and I love them
and they love me.

58:21.873 --> 58:22.999
-  Oh, this
is the other friends!

58:23.041 --> 58:23.833
D.C. folks.

58:23.875 --> 58:24.834
D.C. Delegation!

58:26.711 --> 58:29.547
-  D.C. Delegation!

58:29.589 --> 58:30.465
Whoo!

58:30.882 --> 58:31.549
- Underwood!
Underwood!

58:31.549 --> 58:35.220
-  When you have friends
that believe in you

58:35.261 --> 58:37.889
and what you're doing,
and will literally

58:39.224 --> 58:41.351
do all that they can,
including non political people,

58:41.392 --> 58:43.853
do everything that they can to
help you achieve your goals.

58:43.895 --> 58:45.730
I mean, that's
like the best gift.

58:47.524 --> 58:48.900
-  How did
you feel after Sunday?

58:49.901 --> 58:52.362
- Sunday was crazy.

58:52.403 --> 58:55.657
So I walked out, you
know, we were there early.

58:55.698 --> 58:59.035
And I heard
everybody's cheering.

58:59.077 --> 59:01.037
- The next representatives
from Illinois,

59:01.079 --> 59:03.665
Sean Casten and
Lauren Underwood.

59:05.416 --> 59:06.876
- I'd never experienced
anything like it before.

59:06.918 --> 59:09.671
You walk out and
it just hits you.

59:11.089 --> 59:12.507
Let me just say, if you
get invited to the cookout

59:12.549 --> 59:16.886
at the house, girl,
I will lose my mind.

59:18.096 --> 59:22.267
ominus music

59:22.308 --> 59:23.393
-  Good girl.

59:24.102 --> 59:26.020
Good girl, are you having fun?

59:26.062 --> 59:27.272
Are you having fun?

59:27.313 --> 59:29.857
Fundamentally, people
have to want change

59:29.899 --> 59:31.693
and they have to want
to go out and vote.

59:31.734 --> 59:33.695
Hi ladies, are
y'all voting today?

59:33.736 --> 59:35.238
- Are ya'll voting?
- You guys voted yet?

59:35.280 --> 59:36.072
- Have ya'll voted?

59:36.114 --> 59:38.616
- Um, we haven't voted yet.

59:38.658 --> 59:39.534
- What are you waiting on?

59:39.576 --> 59:40.910
Hi, are you voting today?

59:40.952 --> 59:41.911
Have you ladies voted?

59:41.953 --> 59:43.079
Have y'all voted yet?

59:43.121 --> 59:44.080
Have y'all voted yet?

59:44.122 --> 59:45.415
-  No.

59:45.456 --> 59:46.916
- If you don't go
vote, you're letting

59:46.958 --> 59:49.919
80 year old privileged white
men decide your future.

59:49.961 --> 59:51.254
-  Oh, okay, okay.

59:51.296 --> 59:52.922
- Do you think they have
your interests at heart?

59:52.964 --> 59:54.591
- No.
- No they don't.

59:56.134 --> 59:57.927
- The turnout isn't great
today in Tarrant county.

59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.430
Which is, I was hoping
for some great turnout,

01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:02.098
so it's not looking good.

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:04.767
That was my consultant.

01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:08.938
He said we've run a good
campaign and he's optimistic.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.315
And he thinks all
those new voters

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:11.983
in Ellis County are my voters.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:15.570
I had a text on
my way and saying,

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.113
"You're the first
Democrat I've voted for

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:19.574
"since Bill Clinton,
I hope you're happy."

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.284
Hi, can I ask ya'll
to vote for me please?

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:23.911
I'm Jana Lynne Sanchez
running for U.S. Congress.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:24.954
I'd really appreciate your vote.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:26.956
- Yes, I'm a Democrat.

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.291
But I also have a
lot of people who are

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:30.793
really right wing
Republicans who are

01:00:30.835 --> 01:00:32.670
friends of mine and family
members who have said,

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:35.131
"I just couldn't vote for you

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:36.758
"because you're
just too liberal."

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:41.512
I think we'll know at seven
o'clock how likely it is.

01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:44.599
It was always a very tough race.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.934
People literally
thought we were insane

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.353
when we started this campaign.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:53.441
I'm getting very
emotional now.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:00:59.197
-  I am a very
realistic person.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.159
On Nate Silver it says we
have a one in four chance.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:05.828
So, that means one in
four times you win,

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.497
and three in four
times you don't.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.168
We talked about what are
the sort of hallmarks

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.711
of where you could see an upset.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.546
And it's a great
candidate who's working

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:17.173
their tail off, who's
raising the money

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.008
and meeting the
voters and connecting.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.011
And it's an incumbent
who's asleep at the wheel.

01:01:23.554 --> 01:01:26.140
And I think we do have
those two situations here.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.976
The only way we
take the House is if

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.728
we have some upsets
in races like mine.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.022
-  Yeah, I
gotta go inside.

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:39.987
We are seeing an elevated
turnout, even in early vote.

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:42.407
I think these are the right
conditions for an upset.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:46.202
But it would be an upset, right?

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:47.036
And upsets are hard.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.418
-  Tell them we were
here, that we said hi,

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:54.544
and go back in.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:56.546
-  All right, good.

01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:58.381
- Hi folks.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:03.177
-  So my mom called
me very upset this morning.

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.429
- Why?

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:05.388
- She's like, well,
'cause she saw the ad.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.056
She's like, "What do you think?"

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:08.599
And I was like, "I think that
means he thinks he's losing."

01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:10.893
- But also like,
can you fact check?

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:13.229
Like
just a little bit.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:15.064
- Oh, I don't think
that she really is

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:16.190
who she says she is.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.192
I'm gonna call a
press conference

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.403
the day before the election.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:23.239
I don't wanna just
win, I wanna whup him.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.241
- Posturing as a
practicing nurse,

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.702
when in reality that's
not what you are

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:30.413
or what you've done
is a real concern.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:31.789
Hultgren doesn't dispute

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.083
that Underwood is
a licensed nurse.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:37.044
He claims that her time
working in Washington

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:39.422
makes her nursing
claims disingenuous.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:41.048
- It's really unfortunate
that he can't even

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.468
tun on his record,
and he wants to try

01:02:43.509 --> 01:02:45.052
to discredit me in this way.

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.095
- Of the two candidates,
I'm the only one

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:47.930
who owns property in the 14th.

01:02:47.972 --> 01:02:49.223
I've lived here, been here,

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:50.808
been a part of the community.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.935
My family is here and
I'm back and forth

01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:54.103
every single week.

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.730
We've been incredibly
accessible.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.441
- I was so angry and I
couldn't identify why

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.276
or what it was about
it that made me mad.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:05.281
And then I saw Kamara
from CBC posted

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.283
this picture.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:09.118
And obviously I'm very
familiar with this photo,

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.453
and I think it's
very powerful photo.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.747
But it just like hit me.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.333
That is what yesterday was.

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.837
And it's painful and
difficult and unpleasant.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.631
What they were
saying is that I am

01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:23.925
not who I claim to be.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:27.929
And it had nothing to do
with the qualifications

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.472
to be a member of Congress.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:30.348
Nothing.

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:34.644
It is not equivalent, but
it's from the same place

01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:38.856
as Barack Obama birther,
birth certificate stuff.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:42.318
It's from the same place as,
like you are an outsider,

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.278
you don't belong here,
you couldn't possibly be

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:49.325
who you say you are,
because I don't believe you,

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:54.163
and I am an entitled,
privileged

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:56.123
white person.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:04.674
-  Have you
thought of what happens next?

01:04:04.715 --> 01:04:07.677
- Yup, if I win, I'm
gonna get a whole lot

01:04:07.718 --> 01:04:09.554
of phone calls tonight.

01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:14.684
And not entirely sure I
want to answer them all.

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:17.812
Um,

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:22.191
and if I lose,

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:24.569
probably won't get a lot
of phone calls tonight.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:28.573
It starts tonight if I win.

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:30.324
There's a lot of work to do.

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:33.369
And if I lose, we
have to begin to shut

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:34.579
this whole thing down.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.581
My staff gets paid through
the end of the month.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.083
I'm gonna have to find a job

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:44.505
and I'm gonna sleep a lot.

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:51.345
That's okay.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.180
It's okay.

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.348
You know, I used to
carry the campaign

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.183
on my back in my
backpack every day--

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:57.226
- I know, but now I'm here

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:58.394
- Oh thanks.
- Okay.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.563
-  When it mattered,
we stepped up,

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.231
we mobilized a community.

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:08.362
We created space for
so much hope and joy

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:11.282
among people who
have been absent

01:05:12.658 --> 01:05:16.454
from our political
endeavors for so long.

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:19.248
Hi.
- Hi, oh you're here!

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:23.252
- We did it!

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:25.922
Thank you, everybody so much.

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:29.425
Thank you so much, seriously.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.637
Thank you, thank you.

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:36.599
-  Lauren,
Lauren, Lauren, Lauren!

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.060
Lauren, Lauren--
- Thank you, thank you.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:43.981
-  Cute, rignt?

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:45.274
- Hi Tina.
- Hey!

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:46.901
- I didn't really get
to say hi yesterday.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.445
- Oh, honey you don't
have to worry about me.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:50.780
Are you kidding?
-  No, seriously.

01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:52.615
This is so huge, I really
appreciate your help.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.450
Thank you for physically
being here, too.

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:56.077
-  No, no, you've
got a great team.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:56.827
How are you feeling?

01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:58.120
- I'm excited.

01:05:58.162 --> 01:05:59.288
- You look great, I
mean you look rested.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:00.665
- Oh really?

01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:02.291
I'm like ready to--
- You do!

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:03.459
You look like much better
than most candidates

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:05.294
do at this stage, so
you're looking good.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:06.629
- I couldn't sleep last night.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:07.922
- Yeah, I know.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:09.256
- Yesterday was
just like intense.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:09.924
It was like the worst
day on the campaign.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.467
- Yeah, but that's--

01:06:11.509 --> 01:06:12.468
- This is what they do,

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.929
at the end.
- No, this is what they do.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.263
Well that should
tell you something,

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.473
that they're doing this.

01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:19.767
I mean, that's really
what this is about.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.310
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:25.690
They're scared because
you're doing something here.

01:06:25.731 --> 01:06:27.817
- Yeah, what happened
to Stacy Smith?

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:31.487
Oh, they've got like,
oh, election machines

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.322
that don't have power cords.

01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:35.491
So the batteries are
running out, you know?

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.034
And so there's long
lines, you know,

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:37.952
people are waiting for hours,

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.829
and having to leave the lines.

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:42.289
And the election judges
didn't show up on time.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:44.959
It's all like the little
dirty tricks just to make

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:45.710
voting really hard today.

01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:47.503
- Yeah, that's right.

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:49.505
It's awful, it's awful.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:50.297
Thank you.

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:51.048
We're gonna do it.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.508
Hope to make you proud.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.300
- You already have, hon.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:54.176
- Thank you, Tina.

01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:55.803
- You already have.

01:06:58.055 --> 01:07:03.019
inspirational music

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.531
Voting is still underway

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:17.867
tonight in most of
these United States

01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:20.494
in the much-awaited
midterm elections.

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:23.539
But soon enough, results
will begin to come in,

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:26.333
as the nation has its say
about these candidates

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:29.378
and about the past two
years and looks ahead.

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:33.382
-  Each time we see
more women running for office,

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:37.887
it expands the idea of who a
political candidate can be.

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:41.223
- I don't want anyone to
elect me because I'm a woman.

01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:43.350
But we need to elect
me because I'm better.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.020
-  Democrats
think they have a shot

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:49.106
to win the House, polls
suggest they might.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:51.400
But none of that of course,
as we pollsters stress,

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:52.526
is certain.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.240
-  Tarrant
County, really this

01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:01.118
entire district is
staunchly Republican.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.245
- Well, I'm gonna
argue about that.

01:08:03.287 --> 01:08:04.580
The Tarrant County
part of this district,

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:07.124
Hillary won it by 3,000 votes.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.418
Our projections showed
us to be pretty much

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.754
where we are tonight.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.423
So we're just waiting now
for election day results,

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:16.550
which we expect to be
heavily Democratic.

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:23.557
- I feel like Texas and
people all over the country,

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:27.269
states all over the country,
we are stepping forward

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:28.813
in ways that say no.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:31.816
I'm not going to accept
this as the status quo.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.609
- I think that many
of those House seats

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:36.278
are gonna be flipped
and they're gonna be

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:37.779
flipped by women.

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:39.448
I'm feeling hopeful.

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:43.410
- In the last
presidential election,

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:46.622
so many of our young people
simply felt disconnected.

01:08:47.872 --> 01:08:50.459
Enraged or engaged, we
are seeing the youth

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:53.629
in this country get in
the game and that is

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:54.796
democracy working.

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.631
The record number
of people voting,

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:57.758
that is good news.

01:08:59.343 --> 01:09:00.970
- Among the many
numbers I've read today

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.639
the most startling
to me was that 65%

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.182
of the American people
think the country's

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.642
headed in the wrong direction.

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:09.310
They just don't think the
country is functioning.

01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:12.439
People are challenging the
structure of government

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:15.317
and its relevance to
their lives itself.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.861
- There was another
option to look at.

01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:18.112
- A better option.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.488
One that works in favor
of us, the people,

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:24.993
not just the upper
crust rich ones.

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:26.996
- Just regular old people,
just regular people.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:28.455
- Hard-working folks.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.875
- Hard-working,
that us, exactly.

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:33.836
- A lot has been said about
the fact that, you know,

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:37.046
there are very few black
people who are here,

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:39.675
and there are a lot
of Caucasians here,

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:43.470
but that's not the only
way we define commonality.

01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:46.182
And Lauren is just like
everyone in that room

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:49.810
and we believe we're gonna
have good outcome tonight.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:54.690
- I met Lauren at a conference

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.692
right after the 2016 election.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:59.028
And at the time she
was saying like,

01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:01.488
"Maybe I wanna run for
an office someday."

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.533
And I was like, "Maybe I wanna
work on a campaign someday."

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:09.163
She just had this, she
makes you believe in her.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:12.583
She's got this passion and
she's got this charisma.

01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:19.882
For a really long time,
it was just her and I

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:21.091
figuring it out.

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:23.093
And she had never run
for office before,

01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:26.055
and I had never worked
on a campaign before.

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:28.933
So we really had no roadmap
for what we were doing.

01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:32.186
It was just like, this is
what we need to accomplish,

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.230
and let's start
getting things done.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.734
- There are just so
many city councils,

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:42.363
boards, commissions,
just elected positions

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.532
in this country where a
woman has never served,

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:47.952
where a woman of color
has never served.

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:52.748
I don't look at a map and
see red, blue, or purple.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.083
All I see is opportunity.

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:16.146
-  The
most similar election

01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:18.941
that we had recently, we
had a 27% voter turnout.

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:20.609
As of about 5:00 p.m. today,

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:23.237
we had an over
50% voter turnout.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:28.409
- It was or wasn't,
and he was and wasn't.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.577
- Well let's hope there's
no problems, right?

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:31.954
- We'll go for
it, we'll take it.

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.247
- But people are
involved, so I think--

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.999
- I think this counts
as a problem, but--

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.625
-  The
Justice Department will be

01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:39.336
keeping a very close eye
on interim election voting

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:41.255
in multiple states tonight.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.840
- Okay, thank you, bye.

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:46.260
They ran out of ballots because

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.803
our voter turnout was so high.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:50.806
And they didn't anticipate
it, and so they had to

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:55.269
rush ballots to the polling
places and people left.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.603
-  Some of
the stuff we're reading about

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.022
now in Georgia and
elsewhere, it's just,

01:11:58.063 --> 01:11:59.982
a modern nation
should be able to vote

01:12:00.024 --> 01:12:01.650
with a little bit
more confidence than

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:03.152
what we're seeing right now.

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:04.987
- We don't know how
many votes it was.

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:06.822
I need to do well
in other counties,

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:08.615
but we need to blow it
out of the water here.

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:10.701
- Right.
- Yeah, it's critical.

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:12.995
Democrats must pick up

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:15.497
22 Republican seats.

01:12:15.539 --> 01:12:17.666
That brings it, to get
to the magic number

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:19.835
of 218, become the majority.

01:12:19.877 --> 01:12:21.670
- And this is good news
if you're a Democrat.

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:23.213
You're watching this
and you're thinking

01:12:23.255 --> 01:12:24.381
they're leading in 16.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:25.841
They've already picked up one.
- Yes.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:28.635
- It's early yet, it's only
8:00, it would have to be--

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.804
-  I'm so nervous
right now.

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.806
I'm having anxiety.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:34.683
- It's okay.
- Alabama.

01:12:37.227 --> 01:12:39.813
- Did you hear that Beto's
first numbers were awesome?

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.816
They were only from Dallas,
but they're awesome.

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.735
We must have our numbers soon.

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:49.531
-  60%.

01:12:49.573 --> 01:12:50.824
-  Tell
us how you're feeling.

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.409
- Well, it's very exciting.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:54.703
We have been working
the polls all day today

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:57.873
and we saw the tremendous
turnout in Democratic areas.

01:12:57.915 --> 01:12:59.083
I need some results.

01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:01.043
I need to know what's happening.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:03.712
It's really hard to talk,
'cause I don't think I'm up.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.423
It's not good.

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:07.716
-  If he
is, what does that do?

01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:08.717
The reason I was
just about to talk--

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:12.429
- I need a calculation,
I need a calculation.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:15.724
52 into 98.

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:16.892
-  Once
you got outside the city

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:18.560
in the suburbs
they are changing.

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:19.853
And so it's one of the
things you're watching.

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.855
- That's what we
needed in Tarrant

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.357
and we're already
there in early voting.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.566
That's good.

01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:25.901
- Oh, that's awesome,
that's awesome.

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:28.404
Yeah, that's what
I'm looking at.

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:41.083
- Right now, we're getting
our asses kicked.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.751
-  We
need the map up there.

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:43.752
- Are you sure?

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:45.129
- Positive, absolutely positive.

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:46.463
-  You got
25% of the vote still out.

01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:47.756
By the end of the
day, a lot of votes.

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:51.093
What we're talking about is 75%.

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:53.387
- Okay, so it's
narrowing, always on.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.888
- It's narrowing, but not much.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.765
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:13:56.807 --> 01:13:58.100
- "New York Times"
still hasn't called it.

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:00.602
band playing

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:04.481
- No, but that's
too big of a gap.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:05.774
I think I should probably go

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:08.318
make a concession
speech pretty soon.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.445
- You feel like it's that too?

01:14:09.486 --> 01:14:09.945
- Yep.

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:11.738
We're at like
eight points back.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.073
We're not gonna make that up.

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:19.955
This district was
a lot more winnable

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:22.416
than people gave it credit for.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.918
I think if we'd had
the resources and if

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.797
we've had support, we
probably could have won.

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.179
That's pretty incredible.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.763
That's pretty remarkable.

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.182
And by quite a distance.

01:14:38.223 --> 01:14:42.603
- No we, percentage-wise,
I mean we did really well.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:45.189
Yeah.
- That's pretty remarkable.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:47.441
- I mean, I always
knew that this

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.276
was a long shot, you know?

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:51.445
-  Yeah.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.030
- I wanted to help
save our country.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.118
- Yeah, I think in a way I did.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:02.372
-  I think so.

01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:07.836
somber piano music

01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:16.011
- I'd like to welcome a
friend, a deep inspiration,

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:18.013
and someone that I am
proud to have known

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.848
this entire time.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:23.227
Liz Watson, thank you
so much for everything

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:24.853
that you have done.

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:28.357
The posse that you have built,

01:15:28.398 --> 01:15:31.026
and this party that
is much stronger

01:15:31.068 --> 01:15:33.195
for your presence in this race.

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:36.990
Liz Watson!

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:38.867
Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:45.165
-  We love you!

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:49.253
-  Liz,
Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz!

01:15:49.294 --> 01:15:52.381
Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz,
Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz!

01:15:52.422 --> 01:15:54.049
Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz,
Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz!

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:57.511
Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz,
Liz, Liz, Liz, Liz!

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:05.269
- You all are such
an inspiration to me.

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:11.358
I am so proud of
how hard you worked.

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:15.571
How many doors you knocked,
how many phone calls you made.

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:19.908
You simply could not
have done anything more.

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:22.953
I could not have asked
for a better team.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:26.915
Thank you so much from
the bottom of my heart.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.716
- Our country is facing a
lot of challenges right now.

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:38.260
And maybe the biggest one of all

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:41.096
is that the people
who are in charge,

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:42.889
the people who call
the shots, are doing

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.100
every single thing
they can to divide us

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:47.561
from each other and to
make us fear each other.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:51.648
We see opportunistic politicians
demonizing immigrants,

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:55.277
demonizing people in
the LGBTQ community,

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:58.280
demonizing people
so that they vote

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:00.949
based on fear instead of love.

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:04.077
It's nothing new under
the sun and it's not

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.954
what makes America great.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:09.958
Diversity makes America great.

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:12.961
People who have no
advantages and are

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:14.588
striving for opportunity.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.674
Our love, our compassion,
our generosity

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:19.134
makes America great.

01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:21.970
This country is too
strong and too good

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:24.973
to let hate and bigotry win out.

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:29.770
We are the United
States of America

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:33.482
and anyone who tries
to divide us will fail.

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:38.987
And we will continue
raising hell

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:40.489
to fight for what is right.

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:49.790
- We're up like
2K in King County.

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:52.167
We're down only 1K in McHenry.

01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:54.169
- But how much of
the vote is in?

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:56.505
Well, huh.

01:17:58.423 --> 01:17:59.508
-  Oh
shit, Kevin says

01:17:59.549 --> 01:18:00.717
"Politico" called us.

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:01.635
- What?
- What?

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.971
- Text Lauren.
- "Politico" called us.

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:06.014
-  Get her in here.

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:07.349
And CNN projects--

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:08.558
- Oh, and Dems take
control of the House.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.143
- "Politico" called it for her.

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:13.647
"New York Times" has 93%
of precincts reporting.

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:16.483
Lauren Underwood 51.6%,
Randy Hultgren 48.4.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.403
-  We gotta go.

01:18:19.444 --> 01:18:20.195
- Oh my god!
- Where is she?

01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:21.530
She came upstairs?

01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:22.656
- Oh my god.
- They said she came upstairs.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:23.740
- Oh my god!

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:25.200
- She's not here yet.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:27.577
- They called it!
- Did they really call it?

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:28.370
- Did they really call it?

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:30.205
- They really called it!

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:31.164
- Are you serious?

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:32.374
- You are the next
Congresswoman.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:33.375
- Stop.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:34.167
- Lauren!

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.043
- For real?

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:36.670
- For real, it's for real.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.171
- Oh my god!

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.382
- I can't believe it.

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:42.217
I can't believe it.

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:43.593
Is this for real?
- Give me your plate here.

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:45.053
- It's for real.

01:18:45.095 --> 01:18:46.763
- I have Randy Hultgren's
cell phone number.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:47.556
This is incredible.

01:18:47.597 --> 01:18:49.099
This is incredible.

01:18:52.936 --> 01:18:54.229
- No way.

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:55.021
- Three points.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:57.441
- No way, no way.

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:59.234
-  Lauren,
Lauren, Lauren!

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:01.403
- You hear that?
- No way.

01:19:01.445 --> 01:19:02.779
-  Oh my god!

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:04.030
- No way.

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:06.950
-  Lauren,
Lauren, Lauren!

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:10.454
- We did it.

01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:12.080
- I'm so proud of you.

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:13.415
- We always knew we could.

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:15.250
Thank you so much.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:16.418
- Oh my god.

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:17.544
- We did it!

01:19:24.634 --> 01:19:25.886
No way.

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:27.095
- Lauren Underwood
has won the election.

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:28.930
- No way, no way!

01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:30.056
-  51.6!

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:30.932
- No way!

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:34.478
We did it, we did it!

01:19:34.519 --> 01:19:36.271
- Oh Lauren.

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:37.439
- I love you so much.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.107
- I love you so much.

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:40.108
- Thank you, Mom.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:41.276
- Oh, you're welcome.

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:42.110
- I can't believe it.

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:43.487
- I know.

01:19:43.528 --> 01:19:46.948
-  Oh
my god, oh my god.

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:48.116
I know!

01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:49.493
- Thank you, sir.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.079
And thank you, thank
you for all you've done

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:53.997
for this community.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:56.166
Seriously.

01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:01.463
Thank you, thank you.

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:02.297
Okay, bye.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.967
- Oh yeah!

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:08.970
-  That was Randy.

01:20:09.012 --> 01:20:10.305
- Wait, did Randy just call you?

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:11.515
- You should of
let me talk to him,

01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:12.516
just for a second.

01:20:13.725 --> 01:20:15.310
That's okay, I
would've been gracious.

01:20:15.352 --> 01:20:16.770
I would've.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:17.854
- I can't even believe it.

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:19.523
- I can't believe it either.

01:20:19.564 --> 01:20:21.650
Congresswoman Lauren Underwood.

01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:23.777
- Oh!
- That's right.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.320
Where's Ronnie Cho?

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:27.113
- Out here.
- Ronnie.

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:27.989
- What?

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:30.158
- Yes, I'm right next to Lauren.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.119
- Who is it?
- Biden, Biden.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.162
-   It's Joe Biden.

01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:35.163
- Hi, sir!

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:37.290
Oh my gosh, we did it!

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:40.168
-   You did
it, congratulations!

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:41.503
- Thank you so much.

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:43.338
Thank you so much, sir,
for coming out here

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.132
and for believing in us.

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:46.925
Thank you.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:49.344
-   Hey look, when
you get to Washington,

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.346
you gotta call my house.

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:53.348
I'm close to the
Capitol, and you know,

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:57.185
so I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:59.896
- Thank you, sir, it
would be an honor.

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:01.898
-   All right, well
I'm really, really,

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.733
really proud of you.

01:21:03.775 --> 01:21:05.026
- Thank you.

01:21:05.068 --> 01:21:06.361
-   Go get 'em
and enjoy the night!

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:07.195
You deserve it.
- Thank you, sir.

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:08.196
Thank you.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:09.197
-   All right, bye bye.

01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:10.699
- Bye.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.200
What?

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:16.162
This is not real life.

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:18.999
Oh yeah!

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.876
This doesn't just happen.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.753
We organized for this.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.338
We got volunteers to help us.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.049
We mobilized this
whole community,

01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:29.384
and they believed we could

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:30.927
because you believed we could.

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:32.554
And I look so
ridiculous right now,

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:34.055
but I am so hot.

01:21:34.097 --> 01:21:36.391
It's like waterfalls
underneath here.

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:39.603
But that's okay, 'cause
this does not just happen.

01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:43.189
It really doesn't and I'm
so grateful for your help.

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.399
Thank you.

01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:45.233
Ronnie, do you have
anything to say?

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:46.401
- Yeah, of course I do!

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:52.198
The unlikely victory
tonight, I think was

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.619
unlikely to only those
outside of this room.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:58.622
Tonight you gave them hope.

01:21:58.663 --> 01:22:00.248
And we fucking did it.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:04.878
- Oh my god.

01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:07.255
I'm so proud of you.
- What?

01:22:07.297 --> 01:22:08.256
-  You sure
you got that right, Ronnie?

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:11.426
- Congresswoman elect.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:13.637
- Congress.

01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:16.097
- The first nonwhite male ever!

01:22:16.139 --> 01:22:17.641
- Ever, ever, ever.

01:22:36.826 --> 01:22:37.953
- Well hello!

01:22:41.164 --> 01:22:44.292
I want you to help me,
for the very first time,

01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:49.089
welcome to the stage, the
next Congresswoman-elect

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:52.467
for the 14th District,
Lauren Underwood!

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:04.270
- Look at what we
built together.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:11.277
50 years and one day ago

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:16.324
on November 5th, 1968,
Shirley Chisholm,

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:21.162
Shirley Chisholm was elected

01:23:21.204 --> 01:23:23.331
to the U.S. House
of Representatives.

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:26.501
She was the first black
woman in Congress.

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:35.969
Tonight, November 6th,
2018, I stand before you

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:39.472
as this community's first
Congresswoman-elect.

01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:47.355
If that's not standing on
the shoulders of giants,

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:48.857
I don't know what is.

01:23:48.898 --> 01:23:53.236
Together on this
night, we made history.

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.488
We made history!

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.497
-  A
record-breaking number of women

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:06.750
ran in the midterms,
and won last night.

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:08.543
-  Tuesday
marked a turning point

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:10.712
as the Congressional
representation of women

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:13.757
got a little closer to
matching the percentage

01:24:13.798 --> 01:24:15.508
of women in America.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:18.011
- We were breaking the
model of what a politician

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.346
and what a leader could
look like when we had

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:22.766
so many different
examples of people

01:24:22.807 --> 01:24:24.934
who did not look like history.

01:24:24.976 --> 01:24:27.896
The reason why
Democrats did so well

01:24:27.937 --> 01:24:30.356
in these Midwestern States
and winning in these

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:32.734
really red districts
is because of women!

01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:35.403
I mean, that's
why that happened.

01:24:36.446 --> 01:24:37.739
- The time for people
to not be heard

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.407
and not be seen and
not be listened to

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:42.577
or represented
well, changes now.

01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:48.541
- But it's not just the
story of the women who ran.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:52.420
It's the story of the women
who got behind candidates

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:56.549
up and down the ballot in every
state, across the country.

01:24:57.842 --> 01:24:59.719
- This is the first
time in my life,

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:02.055
yeah, this is the
first time in my life

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.264
that I'm doing work
that I feel like

01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:04.432
I'm supposed to be doing.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.935
I thought I knew what
it was to work hard.

01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:08.061
And I thought I knew what it was

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:10.772
to follow my passion before.

01:25:10.814 --> 01:25:13.441
And all of everything
I've ever done in my life

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:15.610
just pales in comparison
to this feeling.

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:17.612
- The fact that we
had women who ran,

01:25:17.654 --> 01:25:21.616
who didn't succeed,
but so many of whom

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:24.953
got incredibly close
to winning their races,

01:25:24.994 --> 01:25:27.622
speaks volumes to
where we are headed.

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:32.418
-  I am hoping
that that will help build

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.004
and strengthen the
pipeline and include,

01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:38.466
bring in those women who
didn't make it this time.

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:40.468
-  Once you
kind of break the seal

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.804
on electing a woman and
you have an electorate

01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:44.097
that knows how to pull lever for

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:46.975
a non white non male candidate,

01:25:47.016 --> 01:25:48.601
it gets easier to do it again.

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:50.979
So that makes a real
long-lasting difference.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.649
-  We see this year
as an exceptional year,

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:57.652
whether it is the beginning
of a new paradigm,

01:25:57.694 --> 01:26:00.113
a new model for
women's participation

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.782
in American politics, we're
gonna have to wait and see.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.329
piano music

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.668
- I get this
question a lot about

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:15.879
is this a movement
or is it a moment?

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:18.631
Um...

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:21.342
The hunger to know that answer

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:26.347
is ultimately unsatisfiable.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:30.476
It is ultimately insatiable,

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:31.728
maybe that's the right word.

01:26:32.937 --> 01:26:34.480
Because when we're in something,

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:37.233
when those of us who
want it to be a movement,

01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:39.652
when those of us who
are invested in seeing

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:44.699
long term change are
putting energy, thought,

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:49.037
fear into this work.

01:26:49.078 --> 01:26:53.208
We want to know that our
efforts can lead to change.

01:26:54.417 --> 01:26:57.754
But we are the ones
who fundamentally

01:26:59.088 --> 01:27:00.840
are responsible for the answer.

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:10.391
-  I'm gonna say in 2018
it was not winnable,

01:27:10.433 --> 01:27:15.063
but I do think it's
winnable now in 2020.

01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:17.232
- No.

01:27:25.114 --> 01:27:26.574
I'm not that candidate.

01:27:33.122 --> 01:27:34.707
I may run for something else.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:38.544
-  Dear friends.

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:39.963
I wanted to reach
out to thank you

01:27:40.004 --> 01:27:43.091
for your unwavering
support for our campaign.

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:44.759
When I reflect on
all of the people

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:49.305
who made this campaign possible,
it's truly overwhelming.

01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:52.433
I wanted to share with you
some news about my next steps.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:58.731
It's hard to leave, but
I can promise you this.

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:01.234
I will continue to be
with you in the fight

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:04.612
for an Indiana and a nation
that leaves no one behind.

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:07.782
With love and admiration, Liz.

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:13.830
emotional piano music

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:20.628
- There are a lot of
lawyers in this room,

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:22.797
and I'm not a
lawyer, I'm a nurse.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:24.757
Madam Secretary, I
want to be very clear

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.801
about what the family
separation policy

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:29.804
is doing to children's
mental and physical health.

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:32.015
Were you aware that the
trauma of family separation

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:34.642
is connected to something
called toxic stress?

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.478
- I'm not familiar
with that term, no.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.355
- Okay, were you aware
that toxic stress

01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:41.816
can actually change
a child's brain,

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:43.776
because it's still developing?

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:45.361
There's so much
to do within this

01:28:45.403 --> 01:28:47.155
very fixed amount of time.

01:28:47.196 --> 01:28:49.824
So it's just how much
capacity do you have?

01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:51.492
How effective can you be?

01:28:58.041 --> 01:29:02.837
I am eager to use
this role to make sure

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:06.799
that those 720,000 people
across my seven counties

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:09.719
know that I have their back.

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:15.558
The political campaign
stuff doesn't stop.

01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:18.686
I try to just make
the most of it.

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:20.021
So that I'm not the
last one, right?

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:21.856
Like, I'm 32, the
youngest black woman

01:29:21.898 --> 01:29:23.316
in history to serve here.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.193
LIke...

01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:30.531
Let's find some other
dynamo young woman

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:35.078
and make sure she has a
good chance of joining me.

01:29:35.119 --> 01:29:37.205
Or when I'm no
longer here, right?

01:29:37.246 --> 01:29:39.707
That she can come
and have her impact

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:43.878
and um, that this won't
be the last surge.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:50.385
piano music

01:30:19.163 --> 01:30:23.251
soft rock music

01:30:31.801 --> 01:30:32.927
I don't know where I'm goin'

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:35.596
But I know that I'm gonna be

01:30:35.638 --> 01:30:38.599
Stronger, faster,
better than before

01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:40.893
Aim for the sky
superwoman I can fly

01:30:40.935 --> 01:30:45.106
And I break down walls
'cause I am a warrior

01:30:45.148 --> 01:30:46.399
The road that I'm rollin' on

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.401
Is gonna take me
high and then low

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:53.406
But I know that I'm
bound for something more

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:58.119
Something more yeah

01:30:58.161 --> 01:31:00.788
Working so hard
to stay afloat

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:03.958
But every inch I get
closer to my goals

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.170
Jump through the
fire to find my way

01:31:07.211 --> 01:31:10.965
Can't stop me I'm
on a leap of faith

01:31:11.007 --> 01:31:13.634
I fall but I get back up

01:31:13.676 --> 01:31:16.971
I might crawl when
the road gets rough

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:21.809
But I stand like a
warrior through the fire

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:27.315
There's a light in the dark

01:31:27.356 --> 01:31:28.816
Something written
in the stars

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:32.820
And it's calling out my
name to make it shine

01:31:32.862 --> 01:31:36.157
Like a diamond
in the silent sky

01:31:36.199 --> 01:31:40.995
For all the world to see

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:45.958
For the world to see yeah

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.005
Put your hands in the
air if you're ready

01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:55.343
Put your hands in the
air if you're ready

01:31:55.384 --> 01:31:58.846
Come on come on

01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:01.557
Put your hands in the
air if you're ready

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:05.019
Put your hands in the air
if you're ready come on

01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:07.980
Put your hands in the
air if you're ready

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:11.359
Take that leap
of faith now baby

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.237
Put your hands in the
air if you're ready

01:32:14.278 --> 01:32:18.032
Come on come on

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:21.035
Working so hard
to stay afloat

01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:24.205
Every inch I get
closer to my goals

01:32:24.247 --> 01:32:27.500
Jump through the
fire to find my way

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:30.711
Can't stop me I'm
on a leap of faith

01:32:30.753 --> 01:32:33.714
I fall but I get back up

01:32:33.756 --> 01:32:36.884
I might crawl when
the road gets rough

01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:42.014
But I stand like a
warrior through the fire

01:32:43.307 --> 01:32:46.519
I fall but I get back up

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:49.855
I might crawl when
the road gets rough

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:53.901
But I stand like a warrior
