00:07.216 --> 00:09.343
Does anybody have any questions?

00:09.426 --> 00:11.512
Parting has long been
a feature on this board.

00:11.595 --> 00:14.139
- He's a maniac.
- Oh, for-- A nutjob.

00:14.223 --> 00:17.142
- This is humiliating.
- Those are the numbers.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.158
Come.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.081
We're ready to vote.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.500
Is there a motion for Tom's presentation?

00:42.084 --> 00:43.752
- So moved.
- Is there a second?

00:44.419 --> 00:47.047
- Seconded.
- Properly moved and seconded.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.884
All those in favor,
please signify by saying "aye."

00:50.968 --> 00:51.969
Aye.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.220
Any opposed?

00:56.974 --> 00:58.308
The motion is passed.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.271
Call his office and get him down here.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.817
Adam Neumann's office. I'm gonna
pull him out of this meeting right now.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.278
- He's not picking up.
- Get Esther over there.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.946
Yes, I understand it's urgent.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.700
Yes, okay. Yes. Thank you.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.743
He is in the country, right?

01:40.309 --> 01:41.852
His office says he'll be here soon.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.604
Thank you.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.272
Go inside the apartment.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.316
Because this is
what the third assistant does, Esther.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.443
I did much weirder shit when I was third.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.406
So you see what the problem is.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.202
Yeah. I see it.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.703
Good. The last three didn't.

02:00.662 --> 02:03.624
It's the feng shui. It's just-- It's off.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.250
Totally off.

02:05.334 --> 02:11.089
You know, you walk in, and you just feel--
It's, like… claustrophobic.

02:11.173 --> 02:14.134
- Absolutely.
- So, I just wanna go up, blow it out.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.345
Finally get some room to breathe.

02:16.428 --> 02:19.973
First thing I thought when I walked in.
Open it up.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.391
That's what it needs. It's just--

02:21.475 --> 02:22.351
Rise and grind.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.561
Rise and grind!

02:25.479 --> 02:26.480
Yes!

02:27.523 --> 02:29.483
Feel free to look around.
I imagine you need measurements.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.484
- Et cetera, whatever.
- Okay.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.277
Yes, my love.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.821
- I'll meet you in the car.
- Okay. You sure you're ready?

02:34.905 --> 02:36.490
- Yes, yes, of course. Onward!
- All right.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.408
My love, you're not wearing a shirt.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.412
Will somebody grab me a shirt?

02:45.666 --> 02:46.750
I have him.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.794
- Good morning, Chris.
- Mr. Neumann.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.712
Do-- Who are you?

02:50.796 --> 02:52.422
- I'm Esther. Your third assistant.
- Esther?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.632
Yes. I have Phil on the line.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.843
No, no.
Phil isn't good for my hangover.

02:55.926 --> 02:56.969
He says it's urgent.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.680
Phil is always urgent.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.932
- Mr. Neumann, please. Mr. Neumann.
- Chris.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.017
- Can you take this? Can you--
- No.

03:10.065 --> 03:14.027
Turn it up! Turn it up, Chris! Turn it up!

03:53.025 --> 03:54.026
Okay.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.402
Okay. Good morning!

03:55.485 --> 03:57.070
- Good afternoon, Adam.
- Good morning!

03:57.154 --> 03:58.655
- Nice to see you.
- Dead.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.659
Adam, the board called
an emergency meeting.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.789
Great. You can do this next.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.708
Mind going to Bonberi Mart

04:09.791 --> 04:12.252
and picking me up a wakame Caesar
before they run out?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.589
- Why didn't you call me?
- Adam…

04:16.673 --> 04:17.925
…the article came out.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.470
Fuck!

04:26.058 --> 04:28.644
Pull it together, man! Pull it together!

04:28.727 --> 04:29.728
Adam, your door is open.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.148
Rivka,
the board is going to kill the IPO.

04:33.232 --> 04:37.027
We've personally taken $380 million out
against our shares.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.613
380 million, Rivka.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.240
- Look at me.
- 380 million.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.950
Look at me. Look at me.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.619
Fear is a choice.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.756
Hi. You're precleared. Okay.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.815
Okay.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.783
You're a supernova.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.761
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.182
We're going to make
a great deal today, little man.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.600
We're making a great deal.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.727
- Thank you. You've rehearsed everything?
- You're welcome.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.687
- Is he ready? Does he know his lines?
- We practiced.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.022
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.067
Hello. Adam Neumann. Krawlers.

05:59.151 --> 06:02.070
We have something
that's going to change your life today.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.947
Onesies with kneepads for babies.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.784
Baby. Come to me, baby.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.495
- Come to me, baby. Baby, come.
- This is--

06:10.579 --> 06:13.123
- Don't understand. It was doing it before.
- Sir.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.416
- Just give me a moment.
- Sir.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.216
Will your business scale?

06:22.299 --> 06:27.763
The difference between a good idea
and a great idea is scalability.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.642
This has the opportunity
to disrupt the fashion industry,

06:31.725 --> 06:34.728
literally put your competitors
on their heels.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.523
My sister, Adi, will now demonstrate.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.443
A collapsible heel
for the woman on the go,

06:41.527 --> 06:46.740
because you should never have to sacrifice
style for comfort. Right?

06:51.453 --> 06:55.749
Crawl, baby. Crawl, baby. Crawl to me.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.125
You see? He's doing it.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.794
Watch the knees. Watch the knees.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.634
We have a variety of colors,

07:05.717 --> 07:08.303
from oxblood to mauve.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.597
We have taupe, cherry.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.142
We have a brown, a dark brown…

07:16.436 --> 07:21.650
Didn't want to have to do this,
but, Nicholas, we need the deal.

07:21.733 --> 07:26.029
We have black to a chartreuse--

07:26.113 --> 07:29.449
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

07:31.034 --> 07:35.289
Nicholas, my little friend.
Please, we had a deal.

07:43.839 --> 07:47.926
- I-- That's--
- The slowest elevator in all of Manhattan.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.179
Maybe even the entire world.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.597
Right.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.641
Big Friday night, huh?

07:54.725 --> 07:56.185
- Yeah, you know it.
- Yeah.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.811
- Thai food?
- Chinese.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.229
- Chinese!
- Yeah, yeah.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.566
Hey. You want to have a drink?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.402
Well, you know, I just got my food, so…

08:05.485 --> 08:08.322
Yeah, well. Bring it. I don't care.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.532
Stink up my apartment. I love it.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.659
You want me to have a drink
in your apartment?

08:12.743 --> 08:14.244
Is that so weird?

08:14.328 --> 08:16.622
We're neighbors here.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.333
Well, in New York City,
yeah, it's a little weird.

08:22.586 --> 08:26.048
Well, I'm not from New York City.
I'm from Israel.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.633
And there it's not weird at all.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.969
In fact, you're in and out
of each other's apartments all day long.

08:31.053 --> 08:33.388
Your neighbors are your best friends.

08:33.472 --> 08:36.350
Listen. My sister, she's on her way home.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.102
It's her and I.
She's a supermodel, by the way.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.563
But we'd love a little company
if you want to come by, have a drink.

08:42.648 --> 08:43.899
No pressure.

08:46.735 --> 08:50.030
Well, maybe one just quick beer.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.532
…avoiding eye contact.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.284
So I proposed a competition
with my sister.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.286
Who could meet the most neighbors
in a month?

08:56.370 --> 08:57.371
Guess who's winning.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.039
Where is your sister?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.583
She'll be here any moment.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.797
Shit. I thought I had a six-pack.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.174
Well, I have some Heineken in my fridge.
I can run upstairs.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.635
Perfect. Perfect. Great.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.012
Great, great, great, great, perfect.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.559
Do you want soy sauce?

09:18.642 --> 09:21.186
- Yeah. Sure.
- Grab some while you're up there.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.359
Up next, Adam Neumann.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.821
Picture this.

09:31.989 --> 09:35.075
You just graduated.
You have your fancy Baruch degree.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.662
You scored your first job.
So, what are you making?

09:38.745 --> 09:44.334
The starting salary for a college graduate
in New York City is $41,000.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.337
After taxes, $29,000.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.548
So, where are we going to live?

09:49.631 --> 09:54.011
The median annual rent
for a one-bedroom in the city:

09:55.304 --> 09:57.472
$38,000.

09:57.556 --> 09:58.974
So forget the one-bedroom.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.811
A studio: 32,000.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.897
Forget Manhattan.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.900
You could take the PATH from Hoboken?

10:08.650 --> 10:10.819
Or maybe the ferry from Staten Island?

10:12.487 --> 10:15.574
Now imagine living in the city,

10:15.657 --> 10:18.535
in a modern building
with all the amenities

10:18.619 --> 10:20.370
for a fraction of the cost.

10:21.163 --> 10:23.749
I'm talking about communal living.

10:24.750 --> 10:29.254
Shared spaces, shared expenses,
shared experiences, shared memories…

10:31.131 --> 10:32.132
shared lives.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.720
Welcome to Concept Living.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.016
Please. Please. Please.

10:42.518 --> 10:45.395
Guys, you're the VCs. Jump in.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.605
It sounds like a dorm.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.650
Yes, exactly. Thank you very much.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.069
Well, I'm going to college
so I can get a job

10:52.152 --> 10:55.572
so I can make money
so I don't have to live in a dorm.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.908
Yeah. And who cleans the bathrooms?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.077
You do. You and the other residents.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.870
It's your bathroom. It's yours.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.789
So it's actually worse than a dorm.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.629
I'm a little bit older
than most of you here,

11:10.712 --> 11:13.924
so I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.803
You will spend the rest of your lives

11:17.886 --> 11:19.888
trying to recapture
what you have right now.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.562
Every Hamptons house,
every Vegas trip, every bachelor party.

11:26.645 --> 11:30.774
It's all to recapture this. This moment.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.404
You will chase this feeling
for the rest of your lives.

11:38.699 --> 11:44.329
So, you can come in now
at a valuation of five million,

11:44.913 --> 11:49.251
or you can come in later
with everyone else at 100 million.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.095
Thank you very much,
but I wasn't talking to you.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.889
Mr. Silvestro.

12:03.182 --> 12:05.976
I'm not looking for an A
in a city college business course.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.979
No offense. I'm looking for an investment.

12:09.771 --> 12:15.277
Your firm has invested over 300 million
in real estate-related start-ups.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.739
And whatever
your biggest success story is,

12:18.822 --> 12:20.073
this will 10X it.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.537
I think if you could bottle
your confidence,

12:25.621 --> 12:26.622
that I'd invest in.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.875
But this one's not for me.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.628
I'm with your classmates.
I don't want to clean a communal bathroom.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.017
I'll elevator pitch you two more.

12:47.809 --> 12:51.021
Krawlers.
Onesies with kneepads for babies.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.482
Just because they can't tell you
doesn't mean they don't hurt.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.944
And a women's shoe with a collapsible heel

12:57.027 --> 12:59.738
that will disrupt the fashion industry.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.573
I'm a serial entrepreneur.

13:01.657 --> 13:06.161
All I need is some office space
and a bit of seed funding.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.207
What do you think?

13:11.708 --> 13:15.379
I think you're either gonna be
a billionaire,

13:16.296 --> 13:17.589
or you're gonna get arrested.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.142
Thank you for your time.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.534
Okay, well, next up…

13:50.372 --> 13:52.666
Adam. Hey.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.543
I might not have five million,

13:54.626 --> 13:57.337
but I could get you cheap office space.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.716
In my building.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.551
- In Brooklyn.
- In Brooklyn?

14:02.634 --> 14:03.844
Jordan Parnass.

14:03.927 --> 14:04.970
Jordan.

14:06.555 --> 14:09.683
Jordan Parnass.
Good to see you again, my brother.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.310
- Good to see you too.
- Good to see you--

14:11.393 --> 14:12.394
My name's Miguel.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.272
I work at Jordan Parnass.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.399
We do American Apparel.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.818
American Apparel. Beautiful clothes.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.945
- Yeah.
- I love the tube tops.

14:22.029 --> 14:26.950
I work at the architecture firm
that designs the American Apparel stores.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.703
- The architecture firm.
- Yeah.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.623
So you don't--
You're not American Apparel?

14:32.706 --> 14:36.001
No. We-- We spoke already. You know that.

14:37.211 --> 14:38.212
My girlfriend.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.047
You were hitting on her
at the birthday party.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.548
- What?
- Lisa.

14:41.632 --> 14:44.468
I was the one buying shots, remember?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.136
- I bought a--
- Shots.

14:46.220 --> 14:49.389
- Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots!
- Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots!

14:49.473 --> 14:51.808
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.519
Send it in the back door.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.562
- Miguel. Miguel M--
- McKelvey.

14:55.646 --> 14:59.024
- That's right. Miguel McKelvey.
- Miguel McKelvey. Of course.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.859
- Yes.
- Don't be silly. Don't be silly.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.570
- Of course I remember you. I remember.
- Of course.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.948
Now, tell me about this office space.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.616
I can show it to you.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.159
Okay, let's go.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.871
- Shots! Shots! Shots! That's right.
- Shot! Shots! Shots! Yeah, I was there.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.166
- Wait, wait, wait. Five mothers?
- Yeah.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.962
You did a lot of breastfeeding.
No wonder you're so tall.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.714
It was a matriarchal collective. No men.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.132
I was raised on a commune.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.011
- Wait, you were raised on a commune?
- Yeah.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.555
I was raised in a kibbutz.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.474
We're like kindred spirits, you and I.

15:32.558 --> 15:34.977
- Wow. Wow.
- I love it.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.233
This is it.

15:41.316 --> 15:42.818
Yes!

15:43.986 --> 15:47.239
Wow. This is where it begins.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.324
- I know.
- I'm shutting up now.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.451
Do you wanna see it?

15:53.662 --> 15:54.663
See it?

16:06.133 --> 16:08.635
Larry and Sergey started Google
in a garage.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.679
Bezos started at a Starbucks.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.266
You're gonna be the first billionaire
to start in a supply closet.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.186
It'll make for a great story.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.982
I don't want to be a billionaire.
I want to be a trillionaire.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.445
Tell me the rent again.

16:27.196 --> 16:28.197
750 a month.

16:30.199 --> 16:32.784
- Can you swing it?
- I'll figure it out.

16:55.557 --> 16:58.352
Have a blast. Have a blast. Have a blast.
Thank you for coming.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.853
Maybe you should be a party planner.

16:59.937 --> 17:03.148
No, no, no. I'm not a party planner.
I'm a serial entrepreneur.

17:03.232 --> 17:04.525
You know this. Okay?

17:04.608 --> 17:06.652
I'm only doing this
to pay for my office space.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.195
- Excuse me.
- Thank you for coming. Thank you. Enjoy.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.740
Excuse me. Sorry.
I'm trying to get to the exit.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.282
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.867
No, no, no. There are no refunds.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.453
- That's fine.
- Zero.

17:16.537 --> 17:17.788
Keep the money. Buy a shirt.

17:17.871 --> 17:18.872
- Buy a shirt?
- Yeah.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.124
This is my sister's favorite shirt.
It's mesh.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.751
Do you know mesh?

17:22.835 --> 17:24.670
- We've met.
- You've met?

17:24.752 --> 17:27.047
- Yeah.
- Well, have you met a peacock?

17:29.508 --> 17:30.968
- You ever met a peacock?
- No.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.595
Because tonight I'm peacocking.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.808
Well, peacocks don't have nipples.

17:39.977 --> 17:43.105
Of course they have nipples.
Everything has nipples!

17:43.647 --> 17:46.149
Hey, who is that?

17:46.233 --> 17:47.693
I don't know.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.528
I'm going to ask her out.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.698
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.575
Shalom.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.119
I didn't catch your name.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.204
Am I going to tell
the mesh-wearing stranger

17:59.288 --> 18:01.248
who just followed me
onto an elevator my name?

18:01.331 --> 18:03.500
- No, I'm not.
- Well, I'm Adam.

18:03.584 --> 18:06.378
Adam Neumann. This is my party.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.630
See, we're not strangers anymore.

18:08.714 --> 18:10.257
You're still wearing mesh.

18:10.340 --> 18:15.429
Well, if I wasn't wearing mesh,
would you go on a date with me?

18:16.346 --> 18:17.389
I don't date. Thanks.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.474
Do you eat?

18:19.558 --> 18:21.310
- We could have dinner.
- Bye.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.395
You could tell me why you're not dating.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.733
Wait. At least tell me
who brought you to the party.

18:28.817 --> 18:33.322
Sweeping the arms forward,
sit back into chair, utkatasana.

18:33.405 --> 18:38.285
Hands down to the blocks.
Optional, straighten your back leg.

18:40.454 --> 18:41.538
Exhale.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.001
Coming up.

18:46.835 --> 18:49.379
Moving now to sukhasana, easy pose.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.842
Bring your hands to your heart.

18:55.928 --> 18:56.929
Namaste.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.639
Namaste.

18:58.722 --> 18:59.848
Lehayim.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.809
Let's hear it for the teacher.

19:02.893 --> 19:05.145
Come on. Come, come, come. Come.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.151
- What a class.
- Thank you.

19:11.235 --> 19:13.904
- What a class. I mean-- I'm--
- Thank you so much.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.366
The flow in the flowing was-- It's flowy.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.700
- That's very kind. Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:18.784 --> 19:20.452
I'm tingling still.

19:21.161 --> 19:25.707
Usually, I take the advanced courses,

19:25.791 --> 19:30.128
but I thought I'd drop by
and see how the beginners were doing.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.463
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:31.547 --> 19:34.591
- Who did you study under?
- All the top gurus.

19:34.675 --> 19:36.718
- All of them? That's amazing.
- Yeah.

19:36.802 --> 19:40.138
Yeah, but I'm between gurus now.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.850
Looking for a new one.

19:42.933 --> 19:46.228
Well, unfortunately for you,
I am not a guru. I'm a yogini.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.312
A "yoganini"?

19:47.396 --> 19:48.897
That's not what I said.

19:48.981 --> 19:51.608
Well, maybe you could explain
the difference to me

19:51.692 --> 19:53.068
over a little bite to eat?

19:53.151 --> 19:54.695
Maybe you could just google it.

19:54.778 --> 19:58.407
Well, to be honest, I'll be too busy
googling how to fix a ruptured groin.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.329
Well, thank you very much
for coming to class.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.206
Feel free to leave a donation in the bowl.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.792
Namaste.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.382
Hi.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.140
Well, well, well.

20:23.223 --> 20:26.226
You shop here too. What a small city.

20:26.310 --> 20:28.312
You shop here?
Seventy blocks from where you live?

20:28.395 --> 20:32.399
The meatless meatballs are--
poof, incredible.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.818
And you came here for a single banana.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.029
I like my produce fresh.

20:37.779 --> 20:38.780
Thank you.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.579
2.49.

20:46.747 --> 20:47.748
For a banana?

20:50.542 --> 20:52.794
Don't you want to know if it's worth 2.49?

20:54.046 --> 20:57.090
Well, was it worth it
coming all the way up here?

20:57.174 --> 20:59.259
For a date with you? Absolutely.

20:59.885 --> 21:00.886
A drink.

21:01.762 --> 21:03.805
- I love drinks.
- Singular. One drink.

21:03.889 --> 21:04.973
I love a drink.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.352
- Don't blow it.
- Why would I blow it?

21:12.648 --> 21:14.858
- I blew it. I'm sorry.
- You hound me for a date for two weeks,

21:14.942 --> 21:16.193
and then you're 45 minutes late?

21:16.276 --> 21:17.736
I know, I know, I know, I know.

21:17.819 --> 21:20.656
You're right. You're right.
You're right. Right, I apologize.

21:20.739 --> 21:23.200
Please. Please, let me explain.

21:23.283 --> 21:27.496
I was closing a deal.
A very big, big deal.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.499
I don't know if I already told you,
but I'm a serial entrepreneur.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.459
Yes, you told everyone at the party.

21:33.752 --> 21:38.465
- What can I get you to drink, sir?
- I'll have whatever she's having.

21:39.007 --> 21:40.133
Here's how it's gonna go.

21:40.217 --> 21:42.636
I'm gonna finish this glass of wine
that I spent $22 on,

21:42.719 --> 21:44.012
and then I'm going to leave.

21:45.013 --> 21:47.933
If you're going to storm out of here,
you'll need your energy.

21:48.016 --> 21:51.812
So I suggest little nibble.

21:55.983 --> 21:58.527
The appetizers look
even better than the main courses.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.987
I'm a serious vegan.

22:01.196 --> 22:02.573
Not even a taquito?

22:02.656 --> 22:06.910
No, not-- No, I can't. I write a column
for my cousin Gwyneth's wellness blog.

22:06.994 --> 22:12.624
Wait, Gwyneth? As in… Paltrow?

22:13.208 --> 22:14.918
She's just a person, okay?

22:16.461 --> 22:17.963
A very pretty person.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.423
I've almost finished my glass.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.134
Well, we should order.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.013
Just so you know, I'm a health nut.

22:26.096 --> 22:28.599
There's nothing impure
that goes into my body.

22:28.682 --> 22:31.560
My body, my temple.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.730
Bullshit. Bullshit.

22:36.190 --> 22:37.357
Bullshit.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.817
- Bullshit?
- Bullshit.

22:39.693 --> 22:42.279
You, my friend, are full of shit.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.741
Every word out of your mouth
since you sat down has been a lie.

22:45.824 --> 22:47.409
You're sweating because you biked here.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.828
Your pants are wrinkled
where you pushed them into your socks.

22:49.912 --> 22:52.039
You're not a health nut.
You're a chain-smoker.

22:52.122 --> 22:55.000
Your fingertips are stained,
and you reek of smoke, by the way.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.419
You only wanna order appetizers
because you're broke.

22:57.503 --> 23:01.006
And lastly, you're not late
because you closed a big deal.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.966
You're late because you're an asshole.

23:04.468 --> 23:05.886
And what about you?

23:06.678 --> 23:08.263
What about me?

23:08.347 --> 23:11.266
What about you? A yoga teacher?

23:12.142 --> 23:15.437
You're going to make the world
a brighter, shinier place

23:15.521 --> 23:18.106
by teaching a bunch of bored
Upper East Side housewives

23:18.190 --> 23:20.192
how to smell their own buttholes?

23:20.275 --> 23:21.944
Talk about being full of shit.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.321
I saw how much money you made
at the end of your class.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.365
It was a mountain of cash.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.950
Are you talking about the donation box?

23:28.033 --> 23:30.577
- Donation box. It's always a donation.
- The yogi takes all of that.

23:30.661 --> 23:33.205
I'm in training,
so I get paid one dollar per student.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.414
Like a stripper.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.334
And I'll get the check.

23:38.836 --> 23:40.671
Your companies are never going to succeed.

23:41.255 --> 23:43.549
You're never going to find
enlightenment that way.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.133
Well, at least I believe in something.

23:45.217 --> 23:48.303
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- Baby clothes? Really?

23:48.387 --> 23:51.431
- Do you even know about babies?
- Know what the world has a lot of? Babies.

23:51.515 --> 23:54.518
- Know what babies always need? Clothes.
- More importantly, why do you care?

23:58.313 --> 23:59.523
Want to get out of here?

24:01.692 --> 24:03.068
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:05.070 --> 24:06.947
- I thought I saw the look.
- Oh, my God.

24:07.656 --> 24:10.492
No, no, no. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:11.076 --> 24:13.036
I forgot my wallet.

24:17.332 --> 24:22.671
And bring your elbows to your ribs,
lowering on an exhale. Four, three--

24:22.754 --> 24:23.755
Adam?

24:25.716 --> 24:26.758
What are you doing?

24:27.676 --> 24:29.386
I'm so sorry for this interruption.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.054
Please rest in child's pose.

24:31.138 --> 24:32.931
- You can't be here.
- I had an appointment.

24:33.682 --> 24:37.019
- Oh, my God.
- You don't fool me, mister "yoganini" man.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.104
- What are you doing?
- You don't fool me for one minute.

24:39.188 --> 24:40.272
Rebekah, is there a problem?

24:40.355 --> 24:43.609
Yes, the problem is I see you.

24:44.318 --> 24:46.153
I see you.

24:46.695 --> 24:51.366
Under all the namaste, incense,
Buddha statues, you're just a bullshitter.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.619
Well, you can't bullshit me.

24:53.702 --> 24:54.912
I went on your website.

24:54.995 --> 24:58.415
Eight classes a day, plus T-shirts,
plus overpriced holy water.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.042
You're making good money.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.877
He's making good money. Good money.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.004
And you're making really good money

25:04.087 --> 25:07.382
because you call your instructors
"students," but you pay them like interns.

25:07.466 --> 25:08.967
So here's what's going to happen.

25:09.051 --> 25:12.804
Instead of you giving Rebekah
one dollar per student,

25:12.888 --> 25:15.807
she's going to keep the donations
and pay you one dollar per student.

25:15.891 --> 25:16.892
Do you understand?

25:16.975 --> 25:18.685
Technically, you shouldn't be making any--

25:19.353 --> 25:21.688
Or I'll stick her in her own studio.

25:21.772 --> 25:24.233
We'll take
every single one of your students.

25:24.316 --> 25:25.984
They'll come because we'll pay them.

25:26.068 --> 25:31.156
And because your customers are here
for her and not for you,

25:31.240 --> 25:34.159
we'll take every single one
of your customers as well.

25:34.243 --> 25:36.286
She's the one with all the light, not you.

25:36.370 --> 25:37.788
I'm an entrepreneur,

25:38.455 --> 25:40.791
and I live for disruption.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.424
Thank you for the drink.

26:14.783 --> 26:18.745
So after college, I went to LA,
and I did the acting thing.

26:18.829 --> 26:21.915
And, you know, I just learned some things
about myself and the world.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.250
And the end.

26:26.545 --> 26:27.671
What did you learn?

26:29.047 --> 26:30.883
How to win the game of life.

26:32.551 --> 26:35.387
How to win the game of life?

26:35.470 --> 26:37.431
- Yeah, I know. It's--
- Okay, you've got to tell me.

26:37.514 --> 26:40.309
- You got to share this secret with--
- No, I can't. You wouldn't get it.

26:40.392 --> 26:42.477
- I wouldn't get it?
- No, no, you wouldn't get it.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.064
Okay, I'm going to get it.

26:46.148 --> 26:48.025
- No, I don't think--
- Yes, I will.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.777
- Tell me, tell me, tell me.
- Stop.

26:50.861 --> 26:52.613
- Oh, no. Stop.
- How do you win the game of life?

26:52.696 --> 26:55.115
- How do you win the game of life?
- Stop it!

26:56.241 --> 26:57.576
How do you win?

26:59.244 --> 27:01.288
What's the secret? I need to know.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.711
On our date…

27:09.087 --> 27:10.506
you said…

27:11.882 --> 27:14.468
You said my businesses would fail.

27:16.512 --> 27:17.888
Did you mean that?

27:26.313 --> 27:27.314
Yes.

27:28.982 --> 27:31.902
I think it's because…

27:34.780 --> 27:37.199
you don't care about what you're selling.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.744
There's no intention behind your work.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.580
What's important to you?

27:44.915 --> 27:46.625
What do you care about?

27:47.960 --> 27:50.963
Right? You have to love something
other than money.

27:51.505 --> 27:52.548
Of course.

27:56.927 --> 27:58.095
When were you happiest?

27:58.637 --> 28:01.056
That's easy. When I was a boy.

28:01.139 --> 28:02.432
On the kibbutz.

28:02.516 --> 28:04.226
- You grew up on a kibbutz?
- Yeah.

28:04.309 --> 28:05.894
I didn't realize that was still a thing.

28:05.978 --> 28:07.938
- Wait, what was that like?
- It's a thing.

28:08.772 --> 28:13.318
It was like summer camp in America.

28:13.402 --> 28:16.363
Perfect. Perfect.

28:18.782 --> 28:20.659
Make a business out of that feeling.

28:22.035 --> 28:23.495
Do what you love.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.374
That is how you win the game of life.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.132
Will you marry me?

28:37.676 --> 28:38.802
No.

28:41.555 --> 28:42.639
Not yet.

29:05.454 --> 29:07.623
You think I care if it's Thanksgiving?

29:07.706 --> 29:09.625
Work through it,
you useless pieces of shit.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.709
Just get the store open.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.212
It's not about Thanksgiving,
it's about the supply chains.

29:13.295 --> 29:14.463
If you don't have the material…

29:14.546 --> 29:15.547
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:15.631 --> 29:16.840
We're going into the busiest…

29:16.924 --> 29:18.342
- Should I come back?
- No.

29:18.425 --> 29:21.011
I need it open.
I don't care what you have to do.

29:21.094 --> 29:22.554
How are you?

29:22.638 --> 29:27.059
Get off your ass and get it done.
You came up with the schedule.

29:27.142 --> 29:30.562
I hear you and we are on top of it.
I'll send you the latest schedules…

29:30.646 --> 29:32.272
Do you want to start a business with me?

29:32.356 --> 29:34.816
- This is for the January opening.
- Absolutely.

29:35.776 --> 29:37.361
Don't you want to know what it is?

29:37.444 --> 29:39.238
Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

29:41.698 --> 29:43.617
It's shared office space.

29:43.700 --> 29:47.287
Everything I pitched in class
for Concept Living,

29:47.371 --> 29:50.874
but for the workplace.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.460
- I love it.
- You like it?

29:53.544 --> 29:54.670
- I love it.
- You love it?

29:54.753 --> 29:55.587
Why me?

29:56.964 --> 29:59.132
I need an architect I don't have to pay.

29:59.216 --> 30:02.344
What the fuck do you have to say now?
Do you even fucking hear what I said?

30:02.427 --> 30:03.262
Okay, I'm in.

30:03.345 --> 30:06.682
Hey, Miguel. Shit-for-brains,
are you listening to me?

30:06.765 --> 30:08.725
- Are you on mute?
- I'll set the meeting with the landlord.

30:08.809 --> 30:10.769
You better take this call off mute
or I swear to God…

30:10.853 --> 30:13.605
- No. I know. I completely understand.
- You understand?

30:13.689 --> 30:15.065
Are you even listening to me?

30:15.148 --> 30:17.234
I've been listening this whole time.

30:18.026 --> 30:20.195
It's the dawn of a new age.

30:20.904 --> 30:25.659
The age of the gig economy,
of the solopreneur.

30:25.742 --> 30:29.329
An age where each of us
is a business owner,

30:29.413 --> 30:31.623
and the business is us.

30:31.707 --> 30:36.086
- Like JAY-Z says--
- I know what a coworking space is.

30:37.504 --> 30:41.258
Well, then you know that conservatively,
this is a billion-dollar idea.

30:41.884 --> 30:42.885
Billions?

30:43.468 --> 30:45.304
- Billions.
- Billions.

30:45.387 --> 30:47.222
- Maybe even more.
- Easily.

30:48.807 --> 30:51.351
You can hardly cover your rent,

30:51.435 --> 30:53.312
and you want me to give you a whole floor?

30:53.395 --> 30:57.941
Look, you run-- I'm sorry to say this--
a really dumb idea

30:58.025 --> 30:59.359
for a children's clothing company.

30:59.443 --> 31:02.446
Dumb? Lots of babies in the world.
It's recession-proof.

31:02.529 --> 31:04.156
And you don't know anything
about real estate.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.158
I mean, I have a degree in architecture.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.701
He has a degree in architecture.

31:07.784 --> 31:10.579
You know what, Randall?
You don't know a thing about real estate.

31:10.662 --> 31:12.122
And do you know how I know?

31:12.206 --> 31:15.501
Because if you did,
you wouldn't have empty floors, Randall.

31:15.584 --> 31:16.960
- All right, have a great day.
- No, no, no.

31:17.044 --> 31:19.129
- We'll bring you our deck tomorrow.
- Please don't.

31:19.213 --> 31:22.257
- We're bringing you our deck tomorrow.
- Please, don't bring me your deck.

31:22.341 --> 31:23.967
- I promise you-- No.
- No, no. It's a deck.

31:24.051 --> 31:26.929
- It's what? Seventeen pages?
- Yeah.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.263
It's mostly pictures.

31:28.347 --> 31:30.390
- Please, don't bring me your deck.
- No, no, no.

31:30.474 --> 31:34.811
What have you got to lose,
other than a billion-dollar opportunity?

31:34.895 --> 31:37.731
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, time to go.

31:40.609 --> 31:42.069
We need a business plan.

31:42.152 --> 31:44.821
Yeah, I know. You told him
we'd have one by tomorrow.

31:44.905 --> 31:47.658
Every great business story
has an all-nighter.

31:47.741 --> 31:51.453
Okay. All right, well, then,
I guess we get some food, some drinks.

31:51.537 --> 31:55.499
No, no, no. Not we. You.

31:55.582 --> 31:59.503
My strength is in sales, and I sold him.

31:59.586 --> 32:03.298
You're up. And make it 17 pages.

32:04.216 --> 32:06.635
- Seventeen.
- Yeah, but you didn't close him.

32:06.718 --> 32:10.430
Oh, yes, I did.
He just doesn't know it yet.

32:44.131 --> 32:44.965
Fu--

33:10.449 --> 33:12.117
Let's go! We're going to be late.

33:12.659 --> 33:15.579
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
- Okay. Five minutes!

33:27.633 --> 33:28.842
Perfect.

33:28.926 --> 33:31.011
- Hey, you're sweating like a pig.
- I know.

33:31.720 --> 33:36.391
Randall, as promised, one 17-page deck.

33:36.475 --> 33:38.852
Right here. Greendesk.

33:40.896 --> 33:41.897
Greendesk.

33:42.523 --> 33:47.027
So, Greendesk is
for eco-conscious clientele.

33:47.569 --> 33:49.112
We're talking about desk space.

33:49.196 --> 33:52.908
You know, companies
with a mind towards an eco-bent.

33:52.991 --> 33:55.327
- Eco-warriors.
- Eco-warriors.

33:55.410 --> 33:56.870
- Focus on the future.
- Exactly.

33:56.954 --> 33:58.664
Sharing the planet.

33:58.747 --> 34:00.040
I hate to admit…

34:01.458 --> 34:02.751
it's actually pretty impressive.

34:05.087 --> 34:09.507
But when it comes to the build-out
and short-term leases

34:09.591 --> 34:12.219
and unknown sub-lessees,

34:12.302 --> 34:14.346
it's a little too risky for my taste.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.306
No, no, no. Keep it. Keep it.

34:16.389 --> 34:19.016
We printed one
for each prospective investor.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.687
It's yours. It's a souvenir.

34:21.770 --> 34:23.772
Okay, thank you for your time.

34:23.856 --> 34:26.108
- Okay. Let's go.
- Hold on a second.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.110
What other investors are you talking to?

34:29.444 --> 34:30.654
Well, who's up next?

34:32.239 --> 34:33.447
- Arker, right?
- Arker.

34:33.532 --> 34:36.201
It was Arker and then Two Trees.

34:39.121 --> 34:40.121
Onward. Onward.

34:40.789 --> 34:42.623
Hold on a second there.

34:45.002 --> 34:46.460
Let me take another look.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.507
If you look at page six.

34:52.050 --> 34:53.635
- Well?
- Great energy.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.429
Great. Great energy, great energy.

34:56.513 --> 34:59.308
We start tours tomorrow, right?

34:59.391 --> 35:01.310
- Tours?
- Tours.

35:01.393 --> 35:03.353
We need desks.

35:03.437 --> 35:05.689
Miguel, we're not selling desks.

35:05.772 --> 35:07.566
We're selling an experience.

35:08.150 --> 35:10.235
- We?
- A lifestyle.

35:10.861 --> 35:12.738
- A community.
- Yeah.

35:13.572 --> 35:17.868
Okay, can we at least agree
that desks would help?

35:18.869 --> 35:20.662
No, we can't.

35:20.746 --> 35:21.830
But…

35:22.539 --> 35:26.418
A two-desk pod is basically a--

35:26.502 --> 35:29.338
- 80-- 80-by-60, right?
- 80-by-60. Yeah.

35:30.005 --> 35:31.173
Do me a favor. Lie down.

35:31.965 --> 35:33.592
- On the ground?
- Yes, lie down.

35:33.675 --> 35:35.469
Come, come. Lie down. Just sit here.

35:36.178 --> 35:39.097
Your head th-- Yeah. Perfect. Perfect.

35:39.181 --> 35:41.016
Then-- And Rivka. For me?

35:41.099 --> 35:43.852
- Seriously? It's dirty.
- Yes, lie down. Please, please.

35:43.936 --> 35:46.021
It's not too bad. It's not too bad.

35:46.104 --> 35:49.358
- Yes. Just right next to his big head.
- I don't even know. It's filthy.

35:49.441 --> 35:52.361
That big, big, beautiful head of his.

35:53.195 --> 35:55.822
- Is this good? What you were imagining?
- Yeah, that's perfect.

35:55.906 --> 35:57.199
This is amazing. Okay.

35:57.282 --> 35:58.909
So, basically,

35:58.992 --> 36:01.662
a two-desk pod is a Miguel by a Rivka.

36:02.829 --> 36:05.999
It was a chocolate factory in the '20s.

36:06.625 --> 36:11.213
If you inhale deeply enough…
you can still smell the cocoa.

36:11.713 --> 36:14.466
- So, the masking tape is the desks?
- Exactly.

36:14.550 --> 36:15.551
Yeah.

36:15.634 --> 36:16.802
What kind of desks?

36:17.845 --> 36:18.846
Miguel?

36:19.972 --> 36:21.223
I'll get the catalog.

36:21.306 --> 36:22.307
Yeah.

36:23.642 --> 36:25.060
This is my favorite part.

36:25.561 --> 36:28.105
We're putting in a stand-up arcade
over here.

36:28.188 --> 36:29.773
A full bar over there.

36:29.857 --> 36:31.233
All complimentary.

36:31.316 --> 36:35.696
It'll be kombucha by day
and happy hour every night.

36:36.196 --> 36:37.197
Yeah.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.658
I don't know. I don't know.

36:42.077 --> 36:43.245
Listen, listen.

36:44.705 --> 36:47.165
If you're looking for an office
to punch in and out of,

36:47.249 --> 36:50.127
this isn't for you, okay?

36:50.210 --> 36:51.670
Just being honest.

36:52.171 --> 36:56.717
I want you to take your two-desk pod
and turn it into an entire floor.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.428
I want you to meet your wife here, yeah?

36:59.511 --> 37:02.347
Okay, I want you
to find a new business partner

37:02.431 --> 37:03.599
over a game of beer pong

37:03.682 --> 37:06.810
and get so wasted
you don't show up the next day till noon.

37:07.519 --> 37:11.899
Okay? I want you to read an article
in our newsletter that gives you an idea

37:11.982 --> 37:13.817
that just changes your life.

37:14.526 --> 37:17.529
- Yeah.
- I want you to build your dreams,

37:17.613 --> 37:19.531
to find yourself.

37:19.615 --> 37:22.993
And I want you to not be afraid to fail.

37:25.537 --> 37:26.580
That's important.

37:27.331 --> 37:28.457
The most important.

37:30.542 --> 37:32.085
Can I put down a deposit?

37:33.462 --> 37:34.546
Absolutely.

37:34.630 --> 37:36.715
Hey, Miguel, get the contract.

38:26.014 --> 38:28.851
Okay, no butter, no cheese.
None of that, okay?

38:28.934 --> 38:30.269
Absolutely. Anything to drink?

38:35.190 --> 38:36.775
All right, then. That's fine.

38:36.859 --> 38:38.110
- Fantastic.
- Thank you.

38:38.193 --> 38:39.570
Anything for you, sir?

38:42.114 --> 38:43.490
Adam, are you all right?

38:44.241 --> 38:46.618
Give me a moment, please.

38:46.702 --> 38:48.120
Just a moment.

38:48.203 --> 38:49.997
- You okay? Where you going?
- Yeah.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.249
I'm sorry. Can we just have a second?
Thank you.

38:52.332 --> 38:56.503
After the crash,
market short sales, closures.

38:56.587 --> 38:57.838
My idea works.

38:58.338 --> 39:00.090
A version of it, anyway.

39:00.757 --> 39:03.886
You were the judge
for our business competition at Baruch.

39:03.969 --> 39:05.679
- Right.
- Adam. Adam Neumann.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.097
Right. Sorry, that was a while ago.

39:07.181 --> 39:10.267
Well, you made a big mistake
not investing.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.352
Big mistake. I started the company,

39:12.436 --> 39:16.690
and we're projected to make 200,000
our first year.

39:18.400 --> 39:19.443
- Wow.
- Yeah.

39:19.526 --> 39:22.070
- 200,000, you said?
- 200,000. Yes, yes.

39:22.154 --> 39:24.239
- Congrats.
- 200,000.

39:24.323 --> 39:26.366
Nice. That's what my secretary makes.

39:31.413 --> 39:33.248
Missing a few zeros.

39:37.461 --> 39:38.921
Good to see you, Adam.

39:40.714 --> 39:41.924
Enjoy your meal.

39:48.597 --> 39:49.598
Hey.

39:49.681 --> 39:52.142
Can we-- Can we go? Can we just go?

39:52.226 --> 39:54.394
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, just come. Please.

39:54.478 --> 39:55.562
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:59.107 --> 40:00.442
What just happened back there?

40:00.526 --> 40:03.195
- I shouldn't have gone over there.
- Why? Who were those guys?

40:03.779 --> 40:04.780
That doesn't matter.

40:04.863 --> 40:07.282
- Doesn't matter.
- Adam, can you just look at me, please?

40:08.825 --> 40:12.246
I've accomplished shit. Shit!

40:17.417 --> 40:18.418
You're right.

40:19.795 --> 40:21.296
You've accomplished nothing,

40:21.880 --> 40:24.591
compared to what you are going to do.

40:26.260 --> 40:30.013
I know. You're bigger than Greendesk.

40:30.097 --> 40:31.431
But you have to show them.

40:31.974 --> 40:33.642
Otherwise, they're never
gonna respect you.

40:33.725 --> 40:35.102
You have to make them see.

40:35.602 --> 40:36.603
See what?

40:37.354 --> 40:38.730
See what, Rivka?

40:40.232 --> 40:41.650
You're a supernova.

40:48.740 --> 40:49.741
Rivka.

40:54.329 --> 40:55.747
You're getting good at this.

41:02.462 --> 41:03.672
154 Grand.

41:03.755 --> 41:07.843
A block off Broadway,
walking distance to a farmer's market.

41:07.926 --> 41:10.262
- Tons of restaurants. Tons of restaurants.
- Lots.

41:10.345 --> 41:13.056
- It's perfect.
- You're talking Manhattan.

41:13.765 --> 41:16.977
Look, I've got a perfectly good building
at 195 Plymouth. Forget Manhattan.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.103
Miguel. Right?

41:18.187 --> 41:20.147
I'm not just talking about Manhattan.

41:20.230 --> 41:23.650
I'm talking about LA,
London, Paris, Dubai.

41:24.776 --> 41:26.778
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, look, look.

41:26.862 --> 41:29.448
At some point in life,

41:30.073 --> 41:33.452
you have to ask yourself,
"How much is enough?"

41:34.411 --> 41:35.787
So buy us out.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.086
I see.

41:45.923 --> 41:48.550
You weren't trying to convince him
to move into Manhattan.

41:48.634 --> 41:50.636
Well, if he had said yes--

41:50.719 --> 41:52.346
Yeah, but you knew he wouldn't.

41:53.430 --> 41:57.142
Miguel, at your last job,
you made, what, $15 an hour?

41:58.644 --> 41:59.645
Eighteen.

41:59.728 --> 42:03.815
We just made 500,000 in 20 minutes.

42:05.234 --> 42:06.735
Congratulations.

42:06.818 --> 42:08.904
We've proven the concept.

42:09.571 --> 42:12.699
Now it's impossible for them to say no.

42:12.783 --> 42:13.867
Cheers.

42:13.951 --> 42:14.868
- No.
- No.

42:14.952 --> 42:15.911
- No.
- Nope.

42:15.994 --> 42:17.371
- No.
- Actually--

42:17.454 --> 42:18.830
- No.
- Never.

42:19.665 --> 42:20.749
No.

42:20.832 --> 42:24.753
No. No? That's it? Just no?

42:24.837 --> 42:29.258
Look, guys, we are still crawling
out of the wreckage of the housing crash.

42:29.883 --> 42:31.093
We want big-credit tenants.

42:31.176 --> 42:33.846
You two have credit scores
like college kids.

42:33.929 --> 42:36.390
I'm not gonna rent to you,
and, to be honest,

42:37.516 --> 42:39.434
I don't think anyone else is either.

42:40.227 --> 42:41.562
Go back to DUMBO.

42:41.645 --> 42:43.146
A market you know.

42:45.107 --> 42:47.526
We signed a non-compete
with our old partner.

42:47.609 --> 42:51.280
We-- We can't go back to Brooklyn.

42:51.363 --> 42:54.032
Well, now, that wasn't very smart.

42:57.202 --> 42:59.288
- No, no, no. I--
- I'm sorry, sir.

42:59.371 --> 43:01.665
- I'm not seeing you on the calendar.
- Bridget, I-- Yes.

43:01.748 --> 43:04.334
I sent the email on Thursday.

43:04.418 --> 43:05.836
Okay, what was your name again, sir?

43:05.919 --> 43:08.672
- Adam. Adam Neumann.
- Okay, Adam Neumann.

43:08.755 --> 43:12.301
We're looking for our flagship location
in Manhattan, and--

43:12.384 --> 43:14.511
I'm sorry.
We have no available appointments.

43:14.595 --> 43:16.305
Well, is there a better time to call?

43:16.388 --> 43:18.724
We have your info.
We'll call you to schedule an appointment.

43:18.807 --> 43:20.601
No-- Well, okay, thank you.
One last question.

43:20.684 --> 43:22.436
Again, we have no appointments.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.104
Well, I could come tomorrow,

43:24.188 --> 43:25.898
- directly to the office.
- Tomorrow is all booked up.

43:25.981 --> 43:27.191
- One last--
- Have a great day, sir.

43:28.358 --> 43:30.527
What a day, what a day, what a day.

43:31.737 --> 43:33.113
People.

43:33.197 --> 43:34.615
How was your day?

43:35.782 --> 43:37.075
It was fine.

43:38.368 --> 43:39.369
Just fine?

43:40.120 --> 43:41.163
Yeah, it was fine.

43:42.456 --> 43:44.458
Fine-fine, or just fine?

43:46.001 --> 43:47.461
Just fine.

43:48.128 --> 43:49.129
Fine.

43:51.798 --> 43:52.883
Hey.

43:54.843 --> 43:56.720
I'm sorry. It's just so stupid.

43:58.430 --> 43:59.431
I just--

44:02.059 --> 44:06.188
I used to feel really at home
at the studio,

44:06.271 --> 44:10.275
and now, every time I walk in there,

44:10.359 --> 44:12.027
I just smell Cup-a-Soup.

44:13.111 --> 44:16.281
He's not a real "yoganini" anyway.

44:16.365 --> 44:19.409
I know, but I just, like--
I feel the concentration of the salts

44:19.493 --> 44:23.664
and the animals suffering
and the phoniness and the bullshit.

44:23.747 --> 44:25.707
- Hey, hey.
- I just thought it was my thing.

44:26.500 --> 44:30.128
I thought, "That's it. That's my thing.
That's your thing. You have a thing.

44:31.171 --> 44:32.381
You're home."

44:34.174 --> 44:35.801
- I can't. I just--
- No, no, no.

44:35.884 --> 44:37.219
I can't be nothing again.

44:37.302 --> 44:39.513
I just can't be nothing again.

44:39.596 --> 44:41.390
You'll never be nothing.

44:42.599 --> 44:45.143
Rivka, Rivka, Rivka.

44:45.227 --> 44:49.106
I didn't want to tell you this, but
I saw him in line at Popeye's once, okay?

44:51.900 --> 44:53.819
You're bigger than this.

44:55.904 --> 44:57.614
You're a leader.

44:57.698 --> 44:59.533
You're a teacher. An artist.

44:59.616 --> 45:02.286
A phenomenal talent.

45:03.620 --> 45:06.707
There are so many more things
to explore in life.

45:07.916 --> 45:10.878
You're on a journey. And you'll find it.

45:13.130 --> 45:14.339
Do you really think that?

45:16.258 --> 45:17.509
No, no.

45:18.719 --> 45:20.137
I believe it.

45:23.223 --> 45:24.641
Get down on the floor.

45:27.186 --> 45:28.228
Get down on the floor.

45:28.312 --> 45:29.313
- On the floor?
- Yes.

45:29.396 --> 45:33.317
Okay. Getting down on the floor.

45:36.069 --> 45:37.362
Hello.

45:38.363 --> 45:39.364
One knee.

45:46.455 --> 45:47.831
One knee?

45:49.958 --> 45:51.168
Yes.

45:54.922 --> 45:55.923
Yes?

45:57.049 --> 45:58.050
Yes.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.346
Yes?

46:02.930 --> 46:04.681
- Yes.
- No. No.

46:08.602 --> 46:10.229
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

46:11.063 --> 46:14.608
Yes. Yes. Yes!

46:23.992 --> 46:25.786
I manifested you.

46:26.537 --> 46:27.996
Is that what you call that?

46:29.665 --> 46:31.834
It's true. I did. It works.

46:31.917 --> 46:33.377
No. Does it?

46:34.211 --> 46:35.295
Close your eyes.

46:36.255 --> 46:38.131
- Okay, eyes closed.
- Okay.

46:39.258 --> 46:41.885
If you put positive vibes
out into the world,

46:41.969 --> 46:44.137
the universe will open doors.

46:44.972 --> 46:46.306
Don't you dare. No.

46:48.642 --> 46:51.770
Focus on your spiritual energy,

46:52.646 --> 46:55.566
on emanating those vibrations.

47:00.612 --> 47:02.030
Okay, can you feel it?

47:02.823 --> 47:04.575
- I feel it.
- You feel it?

47:04.658 --> 47:05.826
Yeah.

47:05.909 --> 47:07.035
Okay.

47:07.703 --> 47:08.829
Adam.

47:08.912 --> 47:11.665
- It's the universe calling.
- What?

47:14.751 --> 47:15.878
Oh, shit.

47:18.797 --> 47:20.299
Yevgeny Risakov.

47:21.592 --> 47:23.969
I've got a meeting with Yevgeny Risakov.

47:25.262 --> 47:28.098
You're a sorceress.

47:28.640 --> 47:30.058
I've got to tell Miguel.

47:35.856 --> 47:37.566
It was you. I didn't.

47:37.649 --> 47:39.234
No, I don't know.

47:39.318 --> 47:42.112
Something is going on here, but I like it.

47:45.532 --> 47:47.492
It's not bad. It's not bad.

47:47.576 --> 47:49.161
You should have worn a tie though.

47:50.746 --> 47:52.372
But I have on a V-neck.

47:53.999 --> 47:55.667
No, no. He's a schnorrer.

47:55.751 --> 47:57.669
He's from a family of schnorrers.

47:57.753 --> 47:59.922
First, it was parking spots.

48:00.005 --> 48:02.341
Now we are giving him money
to update his HVAC?

48:02.424 --> 48:03.550
You got this.

48:03.634 --> 48:06.845
Go to Duane Reade and buy him a fan.

48:06.929 --> 48:09.014
Let me deal with Frick and Frack.

48:11.350 --> 48:12.351
Guys…

48:14.228 --> 48:15.687
I've got ten minutes.

48:18.190 --> 48:19.441
All right. Well--

48:19.525 --> 48:24.738
The thing that sets our company apart
is that we're not just a coworking space.

48:24.821 --> 48:25.822
We're a lifestyle.

48:26.698 --> 48:28.408
Thank you, human Ambien.

48:29.826 --> 48:34.414
You know what? This space,
it doesn't work for us actually.

48:35.082 --> 48:36.667
Doesn't work. Doesn't work.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.377
But thank you. Thank you.

48:38.460 --> 48:40.087
- Miguel, let's go.
- It's not?

48:41.213 --> 48:43.298
No, no, no. But thank you for your time.

48:43.382 --> 48:45.425
Thank you so much. We appreciate it, and--

48:45.509 --> 48:46.885
Why not?

48:50.556 --> 48:51.974
Well…

48:55.561 --> 48:58.647
You only have north and east exposures,
both into other buildings.

48:58.730 --> 49:01.608
The windows are acrylic.
The floors are a disaster.

49:01.692 --> 49:03.235
It's like a war zone in here.

49:03.318 --> 49:04.653
Definitely have to repour.

49:04.736 --> 49:05.946
- Right? Repour.
- Correct, yep.

49:06.029 --> 49:07.030
Yeah, it's a disaster.

49:07.114 --> 49:10.659
I bet in March, it must look
like a concrete coffin, right?

49:10.742 --> 49:12.452
From September to March?

49:13.036 --> 49:14.454
And there's so much asbestos

49:14.538 --> 49:17.416
that Miguel will have a tumor
before he leaves the building.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.253
No. The best that we could hope for--
You agree?

49:21.336 --> 49:25.215
The best we could hope for is
bland and functional.

49:25.841 --> 49:28.260
Isn't bland and functional the point?

49:29.094 --> 49:31.638
No, it's not. It's the opposite.

49:33.265 --> 49:35.184
We're doing something different.

49:35.851 --> 49:38.729
We're building a community.

49:38.812 --> 49:40.397
A lifestyle.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.983
No offense,
but no one's going to walk around

49:43.066 --> 49:45.277
with a shirt that says
"Risakov and Associates."

49:45.360 --> 49:48.488
- But they will with us.
- All right, all right, mouth.

49:50.157 --> 49:52.201
How are you going to go about that?

49:53.327 --> 49:54.620
Well, I'll tell you.

49:55.412 --> 49:56.455
Better yet,

49:57.789 --> 49:58.790
I'll show you.

49:59.708 --> 50:01.376
Please. Please come with me.

50:02.669 --> 50:06.423
This… This is what tomorrow looks like.

50:06.507 --> 50:07.716
Let there be light.

50:13.222 --> 50:19.603
And wide-open spaces for people to talk
and create and eat and play.

50:22.356 --> 50:26.235
To create businesses,
friendships, memories and…

50:32.407 --> 50:35.786
maybe even-- maybe even fall in love.

50:37.871 --> 50:41.875
If you still can't see it,
maybe you can feel it.

50:44.878 --> 50:46.630
Have you seen these photos?

50:46.713 --> 50:48.006
This building sucks.

50:48.090 --> 50:49.550
It's not about the building.

50:49.633 --> 50:50.884
It's about the man.

50:50.968 --> 50:52.553
He's an investor. Right?

50:52.636 --> 50:54.137
Do we need an investor?

50:54.221 --> 50:55.597
An investor gets us the money.

50:55.681 --> 50:57.808
The money gets us the buildings
that don't suck.

50:58.475 --> 51:00.769
What's the plan then?
How are you getting him to invest?

51:02.020 --> 51:03.397
Adam will manifest it.

51:07.025 --> 51:08.652
I want to be a partner.

51:09.486 --> 51:12.906
We're not looking for a partner.
I'm sorry.

51:13.532 --> 51:16.618
Not a partner. An investor.

51:17.703 --> 51:19.371
You got a number in your head?

51:19.872 --> 51:21.498
Can't be too low.

51:21.582 --> 51:23.417
And it can't be obscene.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.169
Everyone has a number.

51:25.752 --> 51:27.546
I want to hear that number.

51:58.660 --> 52:00.579
Are you gonna let me see the number?

52:07.169 --> 52:08.170
Guys, is this a joke?

52:11.590 --> 52:14.801
'Cause we can't go into this meeting
with Yevgeny Risakov saying,

52:14.885 --> 52:16.553
"Hey, our company

52:16.637 --> 52:20.557
that has no employees,
no sales, no buildings"--

52:20.641 --> 52:22.768
We don't even have a name.

52:22.851 --> 52:25.229
And we're saying it's worth
four and a half million dollars?

52:25.312 --> 52:27.481
Miguel, we have hundreds of buildings.

52:27.564 --> 52:29.233
We just haven't acquired them yet.

52:29.316 --> 52:32.986
The valuation is just the amount
someone is willing to pay.

52:33.070 --> 52:35.739
It's not about money. It's about worth.

52:35.822 --> 52:38.367
It's about how you view your own value.

52:38.450 --> 52:40.160
Adam, this is insane.

52:41.912 --> 52:44.790
Adam. Hey, we can't do this.

52:45.415 --> 52:46.667
We'll look like idiots.

52:47.751 --> 52:51.171
$4.5 million?

52:51.255 --> 52:54.299
- Adam. Adam, please.
- Miguel. Miguel.

52:54.383 --> 52:55.884
You missed a zero.

52:58.136 --> 52:59.555
Forty-five million.

53:08.272 --> 53:12.276
Fifteen million for one-third stake.

53:18.365 --> 53:19.825
I can't do that number.

53:23.912 --> 53:24.913
What's chai?

53:29.168 --> 53:30.169
Eighteen.

53:32.462 --> 53:35.007
Eighteen is a lucky number in Hebrew.

53:35.090 --> 53:39.178
It means you are blessing me
and my investment for a good, long life.

53:43.557 --> 53:47.603
Add 18 cents to the end of it,
and you've got a deal.

53:50.856 --> 53:55.861
Fifteen million and 18 cents
for a one-third stake.

53:57.279 --> 54:00.032
I'll have my lawyer go and get into it.

54:02.784 --> 54:04.411
I haven't asked you.

54:05.913 --> 54:07.789
What's the name?

54:08.373 --> 54:10.083
We need a name.

54:10.167 --> 54:11.210
We do.

54:12.002 --> 54:13.170
"We."

54:13.253 --> 54:14.254
We.

54:14.338 --> 54:16.757
- We-- We live.
- We dream.

54:16.840 --> 54:17.841
We dream.

54:17.925 --> 54:19.927
- We dream.
- We wor--

54:21.345 --> 54:23.347
- Adam.
- Bruce.

54:26.683 --> 54:31.230
I'm guessing you're not all here
to congratulate us on opening WeWork Lima.

54:31.313 --> 54:35.442
20,000 square feet,
right in the heart of San Isidro.

54:35.526 --> 54:38.028
Ninety-six percent rented.

54:39.905 --> 54:40.948
Pretty good.

54:42.115 --> 54:43.450
No, I'm guessing you're here

54:43.534 --> 54:47.037
because your Wall Street Journal
online subscription notified you

54:47.120 --> 54:49.039
about a new WeWork article

54:49.122 --> 54:52.751
that, instead of touting our global reach
or our Q3 projections,

54:52.835 --> 54:54.461
which are very good, by the way,

54:54.545 --> 54:56.839
set out to destroy us.

55:09.893 --> 55:14.439
We have 425 locations
in 100 cities around the world

55:14.523 --> 55:18.193
and over 400,000 members.

55:18.277 --> 55:22.990
So the Journal article,
it didn't upset me.

55:23.949 --> 55:25.617
No. No.

55:27.661 --> 55:29.538
It inspired me.

55:30.998 --> 55:36.211
Our current valuation, $47 billion,

55:36.795 --> 55:41.425
some people think it's… ridiculous.

55:41.508 --> 55:45.262
And, to be honest, I agree.

55:47.181 --> 55:48.432
We're worth a trillion.

55:53.103 --> 55:57.774
I have not even begun to realize my vision
of what this company could be.

55:57.858 --> 56:00.819
I have zero doubt. Zero.

56:00.903 --> 56:04.364
But when you call
an emergency board meeting,

56:04.448 --> 56:07.618
it's clear that some of you have doubt.

56:07.701 --> 56:10.871
So, I want to say to all of you,

56:10.954 --> 56:15.959
if you can't see what we're building here,
now is the moment to leave.

56:17.127 --> 56:19.046
Because we are about to head into battle,

56:19.129 --> 56:23.091
and if one tiny, little article
is going to shake you to your core,

56:23.175 --> 56:25.636
I don't want you on my side.
Do you understand?

56:25.719 --> 56:27.596
I don't need you on my side.

56:29.139 --> 56:30.599
So, what will it be?

56:33.685 --> 56:36.230
Because we are going to IPO in two weeks.

56:38.774 --> 56:40.901
- IPO?
- IPO.

56:45.614 --> 56:49.618
You came here thinking
you were fighting for the IPO?

56:50.786 --> 56:52.204
Of course.

56:52.287 --> 56:55.874
Adam, an IPO is out of the question.

56:59.711 --> 57:03.340
As CEO, I don't accept that.

57:03.423 --> 57:04.800
- Adam.
- I don't accept it.

57:04.883 --> 57:06.552
- And furthermore…
- Adam. Adam.

57:06.635 --> 57:08.136
…I don't believe
you have the faith in me--

57:08.220 --> 57:09.388
Adam.

57:10.430 --> 57:12.182
The board voted this morning.

57:13.559 --> 57:14.685
We want you out.

57:51.763 --> 57:54.641
Adam. Let's go.

59:50.424 --> 59:51.925
Are we done pouting?

59:54.136 --> 59:55.137
Good.

1:00:04.188 --> 1:00:05.397
Call the lawyers.

1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:06.523
Yeah. Which one?

1:00:07.024 --> 1:00:08.025
All of them.
