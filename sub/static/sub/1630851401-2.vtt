00:15.440 --> 00:16.560
<i>I'm scared.</i>

00:18.240 --> 00:20.520
<i>I wish you could help me.</i>

00:23.360 --> 00:25.240
<i>Why...</i>

00:25.880 --> 00:27.240
<i>What's happening?</i>

00:30.880 --> 00:33.280
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

00:57.800 --> 00:59.360
<i>You have to live for me.</i>

00:59.440 --> 01:01.000
<i>Promise me.</i>

01:01.080 --> 01:02.600
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

01:02.680 --> 01:04.040
<i>Don't forget me.</i>

01:30.080 --> 01:31.440
Hi.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.720
What happened?

01:34.040 --> 01:35.560
He tried to hold me back.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.800
We fought, and then
his gun went off, so I just ran.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.280
He shot an unarmed woman.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.560
We must get to him before he talks.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.040
-The police are on their way there.
-He killed Bjørn, and shot you.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.480
We can't stand around
with our dicks in our hands.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.560
Should he get away
with killing your brother?

01:52.640 --> 01:53.840
You shut up!

01:54.680 --> 01:56.840
Don't fucking talk
about killing anyone.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.120
We met at the cabin
for hunting practice.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.120
That's what we did.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.400
I've removed all the books,
so there's nothing there.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.760
The cop pulled a gun for no reason,
and then things got out of control.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.240
-We deny everything else.
-We have to take him.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.680
He drew his gun first.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.360
He shot Bjørn, and he shot me.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.800
We were at the cabin
to plan the hunting season.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.120
That's our story.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.200
-Is everyone with me?
-Yeah.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.000
Can we all agree to that?

02:34.120 --> 02:35.280
Good.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.840
Let me have a look at you.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.920
You have to get to the hospital.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.800
Bjørn said we have to lay low...

02:43.560 --> 02:46.680
You are not Bjørn.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.000
You think you know stuff about me.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.920
But I know stuff about you too.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.000
And your brother.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.280
I just stood there.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.520
I couldn't even fucking move.

03:20.480 --> 03:23.040
I can't be like that.
It's no fucking good.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.200
Fucking Kjetil.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.800
He could ruin everything.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.480
Bjørn had some control
over him, but I...

03:32.360 --> 03:34.080
I don't have any control over him.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.160
Kjetil is bloody dangerous.

03:37.240 --> 03:41.520
You're not fucking sane if you punch
your own son to death like that.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.400
How do you know that?

03:51.640 --> 03:54.040
We sent Stein home
to hear what Kjetil said about us.

03:54.120 --> 03:54.960
Hear for yourself.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.560
You bugged his phone?

04:10.840 --> 04:13.200
We couldn't have known
he would do that.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.480
I didn't even think
he would lay a hand on him.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.400
Someone from Internal Affairs
is coming

04:25.480 --> 04:28.160
to lead the investigation of you.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.080
I won't be doing any questioning.
He'll do all that.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.800
I'll just take care of you.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.600
-Do you know who's coming?
-Yeah, I've met him.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.480
He's from Oslo, but has been working
voluntarily in Molde for years,

04:41.560 --> 04:43.440
so there must be something
wrong with him.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.040
I've refused to suspend you,
because that's my right,

04:47.120 --> 04:48.800
but I need your sidearm.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.720
It's extremely important that no name
or picture of me gets out.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.560
I know.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.640
Just trust me.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.040
I'll do what I can.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.040
A lot of people here
loved Bjørn, you know.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.000
<i>I have all I need.</i>

05:32.080 --> 05:34.680
I'll give your statement
to the lead investigator.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.560
But you'll have to come down
to the station for questioning.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.080
-Okay.
-Good.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.520
-Get well.
-Thanks.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.880
-Hi again.
-Hi.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.280
You surprise me.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.600
Okay?

05:55.960 --> 05:58.080
I didn't know
you could fight like that.

05:58.880 --> 05:59.840
No.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.000
What's going to happen now with...

06:14.880 --> 06:16.360
With everything?

06:17.640 --> 06:21.080
You know, Bjørn told me a little.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.280
Bjørn didn't have anything
to do with Cato.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.160
I'm in contact with him.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.680
Ever since he went dark,
he's sent his texts to me,

06:33.760 --> 06:35.200
and then I've uploaded them.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.800
Bjørn didn't have anything
to do with it.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.720
Excuse me. I was wondering
if I could borrow a phone here?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.760
-Of course.
-Thanks.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.800
<i>No one's shutting anything down.</i>
<i>Ole just said he is helping Cato.</i>

07:56.880 --> 08:00.160
<i>They want to go in now.</i>
<i>They're saying we have lost control.</i>

08:00.240 --> 08:02.000
-Stop.
<i>-People have been killed.</i>

08:02.080 --> 08:04.920
Bjørn said this will be the biggest
thing to happen in Norway.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.440
Those fucking bosses should know
what that means.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.120
Ole is our only lead to Cato.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.080
<i>I'll check, but you have to get Ole</i>
<i>to open up.</i>

08:12.160 --> 08:14.640
<i>They have said</i>
<i>that the attack is imminent.</i>

08:14.720 --> 08:15.720
Yes.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.040
One more thing.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.360
Asgeir, that new cop
with the special-ops background...

08:25.120 --> 08:26.320
He knows I work for PST.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.440
<i>What? You're jeopardizing</i>
<i>the entire operation.</i>

08:29.520 --> 08:32.120
I know. But...

08:32.200 --> 08:34.160
<i>Do you know what you've done?</i>

08:34.240 --> 08:37.160
-Yeah, I'll fix it.
<i>-You'd better.</i>

08:45.760 --> 08:46.920
Fuck.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.760
Hi.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.880
-I almost thought you had run off.
-No, I just felt a bit...

09:01.400 --> 09:02.560
nauseous.

09:03.520 --> 09:08.040
I found a vending machine.
I thought you might want some energy.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.680
Nice of you.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.080
I need you to get well fast.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.200
I just thought...

09:19.280 --> 09:21.680
-I feel a bit better now.
-That's great.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.240
If I could get a glass of water
in my room, that would be great.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.360
Of course.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.640
<i>You'll have to ask them</i>
<i>why they considered me a threat.</i>

09:41.720 --> 09:44.040
<i>Things escalated.</i>
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

09:44.120 --> 09:45.560
<i>He would've shot me.</i>

09:45.640 --> 09:46.880
And the woman?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.240
I tried to get control
over the situation.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.720
She resisted.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.600
My gun went off.

09:55.960 --> 09:56.960
Accident.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.280
Why were you armed?

10:01.400 --> 10:02.800
As far as I can see,

10:02.880 --> 10:05.320
you didn't call to ask
your superior for permission.

10:06.760 --> 10:11.240
-No. I have a special permit.
-Why is that?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.000
It's classified.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.480
Do you understand the gravity
of the situation you're in?

10:18.560 --> 10:19.480
Absolutely.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.840
That's why I'm sitting here,
trying to give a clear explanation.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.800
Right.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.640
-So there was no right-wing meeting?
-No.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.320
We do climbing, hunting and fishing.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.280
It's a hunting lodge, so we plan
and practice there regularly.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.360
Just ask anyone in Vestvik.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.600
You said there were a bunch
of right-wing books laying around.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.920
We searched the cabin
pretty thoroughly. Nothing.

10:43.520 --> 10:47.800
I hope you don't regard those people
to have more credibility than me.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.000
I'm a colleague.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.720
We recommend you press charges
regarding the shooting.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.120
Not interested.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.640
-He shot you.
-Yes.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.600
We fought, and a shot went off.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.120
I think this is tragic enough
as it is.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.080
<i>I don't have access</i>
<i>to your entire file,</i>

11:06.160 --> 11:08.160
but with all that
confidential information

11:08.240 --> 11:09.680
I'm sure you've killed before.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.840
What's classified is irrelevant.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.760
And you're obligated to exclude
information about me from the report.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.800
So nothing was out of the ordinary
before the cop pulled his gun?

11:20.880 --> 11:23.960
No. No reason to pull a gun.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.440
If we don't find any evidence
supporting your story,

11:26.520 --> 11:28.280
you can be charged with murder.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.160
And sentenced
to many years in prison.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.280
It doesn't look good.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.320
You went after them,
and that gun is for self-defense.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.040
<i>I'll gladly discuss</i>
<i>my handling of this situation,</i>

11:37.120 --> 11:39.000
and it shouldn't have escalated,

11:39.080 --> 11:41.400
but I thought it
completely implausible

11:41.480 --> 11:44.320
that this case was closed
with the arrest of that poor refugee.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.760
And Kjetil Vang?

11:46.840 --> 11:50.880
I considered him so relevant
that I had to check him.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.280
He's talked about Michelle.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.520
He had a tone that was completely...

11:54.600 --> 11:57.000
<i>Stop it. We can't</i>
<i>move you again this soon.</i>

11:57.080 --> 11:59.040
<i>We have to make Vestvik work.</i>

11:59.600 --> 12:03.960
<i>We can't make you disappear now,</i>
<i>and you can't blow your cover, okay?</i>

12:04.040 --> 12:06.920
Then you have to talk
to Internal Affairs.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
<i>I'll do what I can, but I can't</i>
<i>meddle with Internal Affairs.</i>

12:12.160 --> 12:14.080
<i>I'll make sure</i>
<i>you're not sent to prison</i>

12:14.160 --> 12:16.560
<i>or thrown out</i>
<i>of the protection program.</i>

12:17.560 --> 12:19.440
And what do you think
I should do now?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.720
<i>Lay low and behave</i>
<i>like a model-fucking-citizen.</i>

12:37.920 --> 12:39.480
Did you say anything about me?

12:39.560 --> 12:41.840
I said we had a confrontation,
and my gun went off.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.280
You can't tell anyone about me
or what I do.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.840
I can't keep quiet about the one
thing that can get me out of this.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.920
Then you don't know
what you've gotten yourself into.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.880
I've worked on this for four years.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.200
And this is my life.
I could lose my daughter.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.600
There's going to be
a major terror attack.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.720
It could happen next week,
or next month.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.440
There's a lot we don't know,
but it's happening this year,

13:06.520 --> 13:09.920
and Ole is the only lead
I've got to the head of the group.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.200
So what do you think
should happen now?

13:19.280 --> 13:23.520
I know people in PST that can talk
to people higher up on your behalf.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.480
And when I'm finished,
I'll get you acquitted.

13:28.440 --> 13:33.040
So, you'll help me and my daughter,
and I'll help you.

13:33.840 --> 13:38.040
And I'm just supposed to trust that?
I'm just going to have to trust you?

13:38.120 --> 13:41.240
I know you have a fake identity,
that you move every year,

13:41.320 --> 13:44.320
and that you were part of an
operation against a Russian mob boss

13:44.400 --> 13:46.640
that went to hell,
and now he's after you.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.320
The informant
in your last operation died.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.880
-That has nothing to do with this.
-You know what I'm risking.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.080
If this operation goes to hell,
that's my life.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.640
Did you know your informant well?

14:14.480 --> 14:19.720
Yes, she was the mother
of my daughter, Michelle, so...

14:26.800 --> 14:28.160
Okay.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.320
Look, I don't have a choice.
I have to trust you.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.040
And therefore you can trust me.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.920
Asgeir.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.440
Come here.

14:50.880 --> 14:51.840
Hey...

14:53.080 --> 14:56.360
I wish it weren't the case,
but word gets around, so...

14:58.440 --> 15:01.360
Right now it's safer for you
to use the exit back here.

15:02.960 --> 15:07.520
Someone dropped hints about you
on bloody social media.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.080
Hey.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.760
Hey.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.800
Did something happen at school today?

15:38.280 --> 15:40.000
Did you kill someone?

15:43.840 --> 15:45.600
Did someone at school say that?

15:46.760 --> 15:49.000
I'll talk to your teachers.
They can't say that.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.960
Did you kill someone, Dad?

15:56.480 --> 15:58.200
Okay, Michelle...

15:58.280 --> 16:00.120
They say you're a murderer.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.480
I'm not a murderer.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.600
Then why do they say you are?

16:11.360 --> 16:13.960
They're just kids, you know.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.320
And I'm a cop.

16:18.120 --> 16:23.560
And they think that's exciting,
so they make up stories about me.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.920
So you're not going to jail?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.040
I'm not going to jail.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.440
I'm not going anywhere.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.200
Hey...

16:51.560 --> 16:54.640
I don't give a damn what you think!

16:54.720 --> 16:58.520
-It's my brother we're talking about.
-And it's my son.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.360
You can't decide how others mourn.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.960
Mourn your son however you want,
but if I were you, I'd keep it small.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.480
And don't drag Bjørn into it,
you hear me?

17:14.760 --> 17:16.280
We're holding a wake.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.120
In honor of Stein and your father.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.920
This town needs that now, Sigrid.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
I'm sure Stein would've
wanted you there.

17:29.320 --> 17:30.720
And your father...

17:32.360 --> 17:34.080
he was a great man.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.200
At the pub, tomorrow.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.720
You don't have to go.

17:47.800 --> 17:52.160
Are we just going to let him define
my brother in front of everyone?

17:52.240 --> 17:53.360
That guy?

17:55.400 --> 17:58.840
Hey, thank you.
Why don't you go find your mother?

17:58.920 --> 18:01.600
-I'll talk to Ole.
-Okay.

18:02.880 --> 18:06.600
He's not interested in honoring them.
He just wants to position himself

18:06.680 --> 18:08.880
and appear pure and innocent.

18:08.960 --> 18:13.480
So he soils my brother's name.
Just think if it was one of your own.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.080
Yeah. Don't go, then.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.600
We can honor him
by completing your project.

18:25.920 --> 18:26.880
What do you mean?

18:28.760 --> 18:29.880
You know.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.280
What the hell are you doing?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.080
Bjørn may have been naive...

18:45.560 --> 18:47.320
and told you some stuff...

18:48.520 --> 18:50.280
but I am not my brother.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.720
Ole, you can trust me.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.520
Just keep writing,
and remember why you're here at all.

18:57.600 --> 19:01.280
Furia is what makes you relevant,
nothing else.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.240
Fuck.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.480
Let him go.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.240
Now.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.440
I understand Ragna has told you
a bit about our operation.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.960
Yeah. She also told me
you could help me out with my case.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.480
I can pull some strings,

20:55.560 --> 20:58.160
but we have to wait until
the interrogations are finished,

20:58.240 --> 21:01.400
and then only if you do
as we say and keep your mouth shut.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.320
So I'm just supposed to sit here
and wait? With no guarantees?

21:07.560 --> 21:09.920
Unless you want your daughter
to visit you in prison.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.280
Okay.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.560
You know what? If I'm going
to put my life, my daughter's life,

21:15.640 --> 21:17.160
in your hands...

21:18.400 --> 21:22.240
you have to tell me exactly
what is going on here. Everything.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.920
And you can start by telling me
why Cato is so interesting.

21:27.600 --> 21:33.600
Four years ago, we began building up
a blog identity for Ragna, Furia.

21:33.680 --> 21:38.520
She tried to mirror him
and entice him to respond,

21:39.480 --> 21:44.320
get him to attend right-wing
gatherings in Sweden and Norway,

21:44.400 --> 21:48.440
but instead,
Cato sent the two brothers.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.080
They invited Ragna here
to write more.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.960
We never knew which of them was
Cato's main contact until now.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.640
We've picked up fragments on
the dark web that involves him or her

21:58.720 --> 22:01.400
in an encrypted chat group.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.720
That's how we know
they're planning an attack,

22:03.800 --> 22:05.520
and we believe Cato is the leader.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.760
It's supposed to happen this year.

22:08.840 --> 22:12.760
There's only three months left,
and right now,

22:12.840 --> 22:15.360
Ole is our only lead.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.560
If he winds up on the police's radar,

22:17.640 --> 22:21.920
we risk losing our chance
of stopping a terror attack.

22:22.480 --> 22:25.840
And Stein and those other guys,
where do they fit in?

22:25.920 --> 22:30.520
They don't.
Someone just lost their temper.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.720
His father, maybe?

22:32.840 --> 22:34.920
They talked about it up at the cabin.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.080
That someone had planted evidence
against that African.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.240
Stein's murder could have ruined
everything for the brothers.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.560
They couldn't risk
the police looking into them

22:46.640 --> 22:48.960
or Kjetil or any
of the boys up there.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.760
That gave us and Ragna an opportunity
to win the brothers' trust

22:52.840 --> 22:54.720
by planting evidence.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.960
-Sending an innocent man to jail.
-He's not in jail.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.680
He's relocated and paid well.
He'll become a Norwegian citizen.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.680
We will do all we can to help you,

23:08.760 --> 23:11.880
but you should also know
that if you do anything

23:11.960 --> 23:15.880
or say anything
that puts this operation at risk...

23:17.480 --> 23:21.000
our deal is off, and I don't care
what happens to you.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.760
<i>In our small village,</i>
<i>a young man dead.</i>

23:58.840 --> 24:01.200
<i>His future brutally ended.</i>

24:01.280 --> 24:04.440
<i>Murdered in cold blood</i>
<i>by a Muslim man.</i>

24:04.520 --> 24:08.200
<i>Truth. Truth is the antidote</i>
<i>to poison.</i>

24:08.280 --> 24:11.000
<i>The veil media pulls</i>
<i>before our eyes.</i>

24:11.680 --> 24:15.240
<i>When poisoned,</i>
<i>our body reacts in self-defense.</i>

24:15.320 --> 24:18.000
<i>Arteries tighten,</i>
<i>our pulse is lowered,</i>

24:18.080 --> 24:21.720
<i>adrenaline pumping,</i>
<i>we sweat, and we throw up.</i>

24:21.800 --> 24:24.480
<i>All to drive the poison away.</i>

24:24.560 --> 24:27.160
<i>A God-given self-defense system.</i>

24:27.800 --> 24:32.960
<i>Our European body is now poisoned</i>
<i>by Islam and its followers.</i>

24:33.040 --> 24:35.680
<i>By governments' failure</i>
<i>to see the threats.</i>

24:35.760 --> 24:37.880
<i>Their vision of Eurabia.</i>

24:38.560 --> 24:42.080
<i>Islam is spreading</i>
<i>like a cultural pandemic.</i>

24:47.200 --> 24:51.120
<i>We must activate</i>
<i>our culture's self-defense system.</i>

24:51.200 --> 24:53.560
<i>Fight for what we love.</i>

24:56.000 --> 24:57.840
<i>I will fight for truth.</i>

24:58.520 --> 25:00.280
<i>Even die for truth.</i>

25:28.880 --> 25:30.240
-Hello.
<i>-Yes, hi.</i>

25:30.320 --> 25:32.200
<i>I talked to the program</i>
<i>about Michelle.</i>

25:32.280 --> 25:34.200
<i>Okay. What did they say?</i>

25:35.560 --> 25:38.640
That it's easier
to relocate Michelle without you.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.640
<i>If we don't want to lose her,</i>
<i>we have to be really smart.</i>

25:45.200 --> 25:46.520
Both you and I.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.120
<i>-Don't you have any leeway?</i>
<i>-I was told to report to PST.</i>

25:51.200 --> 25:55.120
<i>They know about the files I sent you</i>
<i>and threatened to fire me.</i>

25:55.200 --> 25:57.800
<i>So there's no leeway.</i>

25:58.760 --> 26:01.480
And one more thing.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.720
The press has started
looking into you.

26:07.240 --> 26:10.480
<i>Someone tipped them off.</i>
<i>They're asking about your names,</i>

26:10.560 --> 26:12.080
<i>both the new one and the old one.</i>

26:12.160 --> 26:13.880
Someone tipped them off?

26:13.960 --> 26:17.080
<i>Yes. That's all I know right now,</i>
<i>but I'll find the source.</i>

26:18.400 --> 26:20.680
<i>-Okay?</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

26:25.440 --> 26:26.760
There you go.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.640
Strong.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.280
Thank you.

26:31.960 --> 26:35.040
-Do you need refills as well?
-No, thank you.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.400
Excuse me.

26:37.720 --> 26:42.040
Just a little curious about the
ingredients in your sauce yesterday.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.160
It tasted...

26:44.880 --> 26:47.960
-What do you call it...
-Could you be more specific?

26:49.120 --> 26:51.720
The menu said mint,
but there must have been more to it.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.840
There were several layers
to that flavor.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.040
Thai basil,
and lemongrass, I guess.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.720
-You from around here?
-No, I just work here. Why?

27:01.800 --> 27:05.480
There were so many interesting
flavors. I was just wondering.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.640
Where are you from?

27:08.120 --> 27:09.080
Oslo.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.280
-I have to get back to work.
-Yeah.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.040
Do you think...

27:22.600 --> 27:26.120
-Can I have the recipe tomorrow?
-Yeah.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.200
You could put it
on your blog or something.

27:29.920 --> 27:33.720
I was just thinking
you should post it on social media.

27:35.400 --> 27:40.000
Yeah. I can bring it tomorrow
at breakfast, on paper.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.040
Great.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.240
We need to talk.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.880
What the fuck are you doing here?

28:03.120 --> 28:04.880
What are you doing?

28:06.960 --> 28:10.480
Someone's told the press about me.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.480
What?

28:12.240 --> 28:14.360
Someone's started
asking questions in Oslo.

28:14.440 --> 28:17.200
If I'm being thrown under the bus,
you have to tell me.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.360
Who do you think we are?

28:20.480 --> 28:21.440
I don't know.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.000
I've read some of your blog posts.
Dark and disgusting.

28:25.840 --> 28:29.080
Promoting a race war and hatred.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.360
You know it can inspire just as well
even though it's fake, right?

28:35.120 --> 28:36.840
-Ever thought about that?
-Yeah.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.120
Every day.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.680
I check the reader numbers
every night and think about that.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.000
But I...

28:54.680 --> 28:56.320
I have an identity here.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.920
And that's what I have to do
to get close to them.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.960
I get it.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.960
But if any information about me is
leaked, a picture, anything at all,

29:20.040 --> 29:23.760
those Russians will find me,
and then I'm fucked.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.680
I've screwed up. I know that.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.800
But my daughter is seven years old
and has nothing to do with this.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.560
I'll talk to Inger.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.080
-Hello?
<i>-Hi.</i>

30:07.160 --> 30:10.400
<i>-Can you come pick me up?</i>
-Now?

30:10.480 --> 30:13.280
<i>I can't take sleeping</i>
<i>in a tent anymore.</i>

30:15.320 --> 30:18.880
I'm with that guy you met. Richard.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.720
<i>-Are you a couple now?</i>
-I don't know.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.280
We have the house
to ourselves for one more day,

30:25.360 --> 30:29.280
so do you think
you could stay just a bit longer?

30:29.360 --> 30:32.920
<i>Fine. But you owe me.</i>

30:33.000 --> 30:36.960
<i>-You're an angel. Love you.</i>
<i>-Love you too.</i>

30:56.840 --> 30:59.600
Ole just showed up.
I couldn't stop him.

30:59.680 --> 31:00.960
I'm glad you called.

31:01.040 --> 31:04.520
-I'm doing this in their memory.
-No one in my family wants this.

31:04.600 --> 31:08.240
Not Grete, not Sigrid,
and not me either.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.480
Bjørn was like family
to all of us here.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.800
I'm giving him and my son the respect
and attention they deserve.

31:14.880 --> 31:18.280
If you did that when they were alive,
maybe we wouldn't be here.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.200
You don't have
a monopoly on grief, Ole.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.760
But then you've never handled loss
very well, have you?

31:25.560 --> 31:28.800
I remember Bjørn was worried
about you when your father died.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.400
-How long were you committed for?
-Shut up and sit down.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.880
-Afraid of losing it?
-I told you to watch it.

31:44.760 --> 31:47.240
Were you the reason
your father lost it?

31:47.840 --> 31:50.680
You're not going to make me
throw the first punch.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.240
That's because you're a cunt.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.360
Stay here.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.240
Let him be.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.240
And you...

32:46.040 --> 32:48.600
That's enough!

32:54.320 --> 32:55.800
Stop it!

33:02.720 --> 33:04.320
You have to stop.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.120
Ole, don't do this.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.880
What the fuck is going on here?

33:26.400 --> 33:27.440
Huh?

33:30.880 --> 33:34.160
You're supposed to hold a wake,
and this is how you behave?

33:39.920 --> 33:42.760
You, get him home right now.

34:17.880 --> 34:21.480
You want a beer or something?
Calm down a bit?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.320
No, thanks.
I think I'll just take a walk.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.320
What?

34:48.800 --> 34:50.080
Some are worried.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.280
We need to know
they are not on to us.

34:54.280 --> 34:56.440
Do you have control
of the situation?

34:56.520 --> 34:57.600
Yeah.

35:44.560 --> 35:49.920
<i>Dad, you should know that it was</i>
<i>Stein and me at the refugee center,</i>

35:51.000 --> 35:52.600
<i>but it wasn't he who lit that fire.</i>

35:53.680 --> 35:54.800
<i>It was me.</i>

35:58.120 --> 36:01.640
<i>"People are being killed</i>
<i>because they want our future.</i>

36:01.720 --> 36:04.800
<i>They should know that because</i>
<i>of heroes working in silence,</i>

36:04.880 --> 36:06.320
<i>they will never get it."</i>

36:07.200 --> 36:09.200
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

36:09.280 --> 36:13.720
I was just checking to see
if I could find the order lists.

36:15.840 --> 36:20.120
I just thought I could make things
run smoothly here,

36:20.200 --> 36:22.640
so you can focus
on your family instead.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.240
I can't find her. Sigrid.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.720
And Ole isn't answering.
I've looked everywhere.

36:28.880 --> 36:35.600
She's probably just blowing off
some steam, clearing her head.

36:35.680 --> 36:40.640
Bjørn had that anger in him,
but I didn't think Sigrid did.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.160
Not until now. Not before you came.

36:45.600 --> 36:49.160
I don't want you to keep
spreading your darkness to her.

36:50.320 --> 36:54.360
I haven't spread anything to anyone.
Least of all to Sigrid.

36:54.880 --> 36:59.400
I want you to leave Trollheim
right now. For Sigrid's sake.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.120
<i>-So it's over? All charges dropped?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

37:07.560 --> 37:09.600
But I'm going to deliver a report.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.000
A good and thorough report.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.440
Someone in Oslo
must love you very much.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.800
Have a nice trip.

37:26.520 --> 37:30.120
You should have seen him when they
told him to end the investigation.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.200
He was pissed.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.520
I can imagine.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.720
Yeah, but...

37:37.480 --> 37:41.160
a lot of people here won't be happy
seeing you back at work.

37:41.240 --> 37:44.360
Many people loved Bjørn, like I said.

37:44.440 --> 37:48.040
-I'll keep a low profile.
-That's good.

37:49.400 --> 37:53.600
Right. We have to get things
back to normal here.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.120
Thank you.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.520
What the fuck are you doing?

38:14.440 --> 38:16.240
Just checking your computer.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.800
We can't have
any tracking or spyware.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.040
They're over there.

38:32.760 --> 38:35.240
Okay, so both bottles, right?

38:35.320 --> 38:37.400
Yes, both of them.
But you take it easy.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.000
Gunnar will be there at 11.

38:39.080 --> 38:43.000
If there's any trouble
before then, just leave.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.120
Okay.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.960
Have you talked to Grete?

38:49.080 --> 38:52.000
Yeah. She wants me gone.

38:53.040 --> 38:56.600
Yes, she thinks you're the reason
Sigrid's started writing.

38:57.480 --> 39:01.600
She discovered something Sigrid
had written online, some comments.

39:01.680 --> 39:06.120
She doesn't know Bjørn and I have
been teaching her about the world.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.160
I showed her
some of your writing too.

39:10.480 --> 39:14.080
-We've talked about this.
-I didn't say that you are Furia.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.840
And besides, you should be proud.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.640
You awakened something in her.
She was up all night reading.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.760
And now she wants to write too.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.360
So I helped her set up her own blog.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.480
Give me your phone.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.160
-Why?
-Give me your phone.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.400
Come.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.440
This was where I found my father.

40:00.280 --> 40:01.680
Hanging from that beam.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.480
-The bankruptcy?
-No.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.280
His inability to readjust.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.600
There wasn't much help
to be had for people like him.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.480
And he drank, too.

40:14.640 --> 40:17.520
Pointless. He died for nothing.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.240
What exactly did Bjørn tell you?

40:21.960 --> 40:24.880
He said he was going to be part
of something big.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.120
The biggest thing
in the history of Norway.

40:27.200 --> 40:30.720
Yes. People are wondering
if I can trust you.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.960
I think you should make up your mind!

40:38.000 --> 40:41.880
"History shows
that those who have a plan,

40:41.960 --> 40:46.760
anticipate, and have
a coherent strategy, usually win.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.960
And we are not winning."

40:50.800 --> 40:53.040
-Fjordman?
-No.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.640
Cato wrote that.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.000
Fjordman stole it.

41:01.200 --> 41:05.000
The first time I saw you was during
that demonstration in Gothenburg.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.680
You were there looking for him.

41:06.760 --> 41:10.080
I had only read your texts,
like he told me to,

41:10.160 --> 41:11.320
but when I saw you...

41:12.800 --> 41:15.480
it was like I could recognize
the words in your face.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.960
You write like him.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.320
Same vision, but a different voice.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.880
Was he in Gothenburg too?

41:33.520 --> 41:36.520
Yes, he was. He made me contact you.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.280
He's following you.

41:40.520 --> 41:41.480
What's that?

41:42.200 --> 41:43.880
Digital equipment.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.880
Bjørn and I said
we were going climbing,

41:45.960 --> 41:49.480
so I told Grete I still want
to take the trip in his honor.

41:50.160 --> 41:52.240
You do as Grete told you to.

41:52.320 --> 41:54.320
Pack only your most essential stuff.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.400
Cato has been planning this
for a long time.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.320
He thinks we need you,
and your words.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.120
So you'll come with me.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.360
For what?

42:44.960 --> 42:45.920
Come on.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.160
One more.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.400
Maybe some other time.

42:53.680 --> 42:58.600
Just don't... keep looking
in the rear-view mirror.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.080
Goodbye.

43:03.560 --> 43:04.880
The problem...

43:07.440 --> 43:09.320
with young people today is...

43:23.520 --> 43:24.760
No, you wait here.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.360
Wait till I'm back, okay?

44:25.480 --> 44:27.160
Did you like the whisky?

44:29.280 --> 44:31.640
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-Just stay calm.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.760
Stay calm.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.600
-I hope you liked the whisky.
-What the fuck!

44:36.680 --> 44:39.840
-Punch someone like that...
-What the fuck do you want!

46:26.360 --> 46:27.560
What's going on?

46:29.720 --> 46:31.560
We're going to pick up one more.

46:32.760 --> 46:35.360
Remember, Cato decides
who gets to know what.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.080
Don't talk to him about Cato.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.920
Good evening.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.760
Nice meeting you again.

46:54.560 --> 47:00.160
-As we agreed, you follow my lead.
-Yes.

47:31.680 --> 47:34.680
<i>Promise me that. Don't give up.</i>

47:38.000 --> 47:40.880
<i>Tell Dad and our brother</i>
<i>that I love them.</i>

47:42.840 --> 47:45.320
<i>You're the best sister in the world.</i>

47:48.760 --> 47:52.360
<i>He's coming. He's coming now.</i>

47:52.440 --> 47:53.520
<i>He's coming.</i>

47:54.640 --> 48:00.320
<i>Please! Please, don't shoot!</i>
<i>Don't! Don't shoot!</i>

48:22.040 --> 48:23.440
<i>How many?</i>

48:23.520 --> 48:28.120
<i>We still don't know exactly how many</i>
<i>at Utøya. But over 60 kids so far.</i>

49:15.200 --> 49:18.200
