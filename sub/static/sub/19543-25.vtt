WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:07.088
The fair warrior Zarbon made
a menacing transformation.

00:07.174 --> 00:12.510
Vegeta was overcome by his fearsome power.

00:14.973 --> 00:20.434
Meanwhile, Kuririn was racing to the Grand Elder.

00:20.521 --> 00:24.685
|-| won't let anyone have the Dragon Balls!

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
I'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your souI already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.988 --> 01:58.699
"Power Up, Kuririn!
Freeza's Writhing Apprehension. "

02:05.501 --> 02:09.539
There it is. You can see that tall rock there, right?

02:09.630 --> 02:11.291
That's it?

02:17.638 --> 02:19.845
That was a long way.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.017
The Grand Elder is inside that house.

02:29.107 --> 02:33.350
I'm surprised it's still here.
As conspicuous as this place is,

02:33.445 --> 02:37.233
it's only a matter of time
before the bad guys find it.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.215 --> 02:56.423
He hasn't been done in already, right?

02:58.303 --> 03:00.214
He couldn't be...

03:14.361 --> 03:17.728
Nail-san! Thank goodness! You're all right, then!

03:17.823 --> 03:20.940
H-He looks just like Piccolo!

03:21.034 --> 03:25.027
I'm glad you made it here, Dende, and the visitor.

03:25.122 --> 03:29.832
The Grand Elder already knows
the gist of what's going on.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.126
Then the Grand Elder sees what is happening?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.545
That saves us the trouble
of explaining everything.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.375
Both of you, come inside.
The Grand Elder will see you.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.462
U-Um, if you already know
roughly what is going on,

03:43.557 --> 03:47.345
w-why haven't you left such
a dangerous place as this?

03:47.436 --> 03:54.604
The Grand Elder has grown too old.
He knows that his death is near.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.354
There was nothing else we could do

03:56.445 --> 03:59.403
but let him remain here while I protect him.

03:59.489 --> 04:04.074
I'd heard he was near his end,
but I didn't know it was so serious.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.322
Come, inside.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.245
This guy can handle himself.

04:09.333 --> 04:13.997
Compared to the other Namekians,
I sense remarkable power from him.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.834
Up above.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.084
Right.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.225
Grand Elder, Dende, and a visitor.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.644
H-He's huge!

04:32.731 --> 04:37.600
Welcome. You are an earthling, right?

04:37.694 --> 04:42.529
First, I would like to express my
gratitude for saving my child, Dende.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.947
Thank you.

04:44.034 --> 04:48.403
Er, not at all. M wasn't able to do all that much.

05:07.557 --> 05:11.095
I'm maxed out... I've gotta rest for a bit...

05:14.982 --> 05:21.194
Still, I've mastered 50-times gravity
a lot sooner than I thought.

05:24.157 --> 05:29.402
Looks like my duel with Vegeta
wasn't entirely for nothing, huh?

05:44.469 --> 05:46.551
Because of those villains,

05:46.638 --> 05:52.508
most of my children on
this world have been killed.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.558
lt grieves me.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.765
They seem to be after the
Dragon Balls, don't they?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.100
Yes.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.482
I never imagined that those globes of hope,

06:04.573 --> 06:07.406
a testament to the wisdom
and power of the Namekians,

06:07.492 --> 06:09.699
would bring this about.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.822
Forgive me for coming right to the point,

06:11.913 --> 06:14.290
but could I ask you to let me
borrow that Dragon Ball

06:14.374 --> 06:17.662
above your head for a short while?

06:17.753 --> 06:21.712
I will never give it to those guys. I promise.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.541
You are collecting the Dragon Balls, too, are you?

06:25.635 --> 06:29.753
Yes. I want to bring my fallen friends back to life.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.055
I would like to request it, as well.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.805
Grand Elder, if these people's
friends return to life,

06:35.896 --> 06:39.059
they might be able to put down those evil men.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.016
How do you know about the Dragon Balls?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.941
We had them on Earth, as well.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.565
You what?!

06:45.655 --> 06:48.397
Long ago, during the crisis on this world,

06:48.492 --> 06:51.905
there was a Namekian who fled to Earth.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.593
He created our Dragon Balls.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.548
Ah, yes, I remember now.
That was the child of Katattsu.

07:14.643 --> 07:20.138
What a surprise. To think that
he safely arrived on Earth.

07:20.232 --> 07:25.647
He was a gifted Dragon-type child,
who could create Dragon Balls.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.480
He was also killed,
along with the rest of our friends,

07:29.574 --> 07:33.362
by a Saiyan named Vegeta, who has come here.

07:33.453 --> 07:38.322
The Saiyans are indeed formidable.
That poor child prodigy...

07:38.416 --> 07:42.455
That Saiyan wouldn't happen
to be a Super Saiyan, would he?

07:42.546 --> 07:44.457
W-What is that?

07:44.548 --> 07:50.589
G-Gentleman from Earth,
could I ask you to come over here?

07:50.679 --> 07:52.340
Sure...

07:54.516 --> 07:59.761
Please allow me to explore
a little of Earth's past.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.891
P-Past?

08:21.793 --> 08:27.584
Oh, my goodness! Evil entered into him,
and his body was split into two.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.446
So in order for him to become Kami,

08:53.533 --> 08:58.823
he could not have even
the slightest evil sentiment.

08:58.914 --> 09:02.748
As a result, the evil Piccolo was born.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.870
However, it is a pity.

09:04.961 --> 09:08.829
Imagine, him halving his
prodigious inborn powers like that.

09:08.924 --> 09:11.040
If he had become one again,
like he originally was,

09:11.134 --> 09:15.218
he may have made it through without dying.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.886
O-One again?

09:16.973 --> 09:22.263
Well, I suppose it's all right.
Your desires are pure, after all.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.562
Your courage up to now is greatly esteemed.

09:25.649 --> 09:28.891
I shall give you this Dragon Ball.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.941
Terrific!

09:31.029 --> 09:33.896
Thank you very much.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.823
So this is an original Dragon Ball.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.865
It sure is big.

09:37.953 --> 09:41.616
However, your wish is not likely to be granted.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.912
Why not?

09:42.999 --> 09:47.834
Unfortunately, my life will
only last a few more days.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.037
Can you steal the balls

09:51.132 --> 09:54.920
already gathered by those villains in that time?

09:55.011 --> 09:59.596
More than likely, it will be
quite impossible. Once I die...

10:01.851 --> 10:04.467
Grand Elder!

10:04.562 --> 10:07.804
...the Dragon Balls will also be extinguished.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.520
It's all right! We have no choice!

10:11.611 --> 10:14.819
For the time being, I will protect
this Dragon Ball with my life!

10:14.906 --> 10:19.775
It's far better than letting those
guys have eternal life, after all.

10:19.869 --> 10:24.112
If you'd be so kind. I no longer
have the strength to protect it.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.993
I'll make sure to!

10:26.084 --> 10:29.576
You possess exceptional power.

10:29.671 --> 10:33.380
It's a shame you still have
so much power left dormant.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.297
Dormant power?

10:35.385 --> 10:38.752
Allow me to release that power.

10:41.933 --> 10:45.300
No way, I couldn't have that kind of power left.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.807
I've trained quite extensively, after all...

10:50.900 --> 10:54.392
Even now, I'm beyond my limits!

11:07.917 --> 11:12.502
Please find a way to somehow
escape their clutches.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.665
The power... the power...!

11:18.845 --> 11:21.928
The power is starting to gush forth!

11:22.015 --> 11:24.882
Incredible!

11:24.976 --> 11:29.561
U-Unbelievable! It feels like I've been reborn!

11:29.647 --> 11:31.774
Thank you very much!

11:33.234 --> 11:38.354
U-Um... can you call forth anyone's power?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.064
Like say, from a small child?

11:41.159 --> 11:45.493
It is possible for anyone, as long
as they have dormant power.

11:45.580 --> 11:49.118
If you do this too much, will it shorten your life?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.916
All I do is provide the trigger.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.665
It has nothing to do with my lifespan.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.590
W-Would it be all right if I brought
another one of my friends here?

11:58.676 --> 12:02.589
He's sure to have an enormous
amount of dormant power.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.136
Then bring him here.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.716
The more powerful people we have
on the side of right, the better.

12:07.811 --> 12:11.349
Right! I will bring him here right away!

12:11.439 --> 12:13.816
U-Um, what about this?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.765
Please take it with you.

12:15.860 --> 12:21.275
I leave the future of this world,
and the universe, in your hands.

12:23.952 --> 12:28.036
Dende, you wait here.
I'll be right back with Gohan.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.704
P-Please be careful.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.327
Mm-hmm.

12:41.511 --> 12:45.095
This is awesome! Who'd have
thought I had this kind of power?

12:45.181 --> 12:48.673
I should be able to pick up Gohan
in just a few hours like this!

13:17.755 --> 13:19.666
H-How can this be?

13:19.757 --> 13:24.296
A village that we haven't attacked
yet has already been wiped out!

13:39.402 --> 13:44.738
If I submerge this Dragon Ball here,
no one will be able to find it.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.908
I have to get that Dragon Ball
back, no matter what...

13:53.416 --> 13:55.623
What happened? Who did this to you?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.622
T-The Saiyan took our Dragon Ball...

13:58.713 --> 14:00.544
It was Vegeta, all right.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.590
T-The Dragon Ball...

14:06.012 --> 14:08.549
Die already, will you?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.395
Freeza-sama, it is Zarbon.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.647
Enter.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.279
Did you find a village?

14:30.370 --> 14:34.329
No. As of this moment,
I have not found any villages,

14:34.415 --> 14:37.407
but I did defeat Vegeta.

14:37.502 --> 14:41.711
Ho, did you? Then Zarbon-san, you transformed?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.880
The first time in a long while?

14:43.967 --> 14:47.755
--Yes, sir.
--So, is Vegeta dead?

14:47.845 --> 14:51.679
Well, I did not exactly check for his corpse,

14:51.766 --> 14:53.597
but if, by some slim chance, he is still alive,

14:53.685 --> 14:56.222
he would be gravely injured.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.304
Why did you not confirm that he was dead?!

14:59.399 --> 15:03.483
W-Well, Vegeta was
submerged under the water, so...

15:03.570 --> 15:06.061
You could have gone under the water, correct?

15:06.155 --> 15:10.239
You failed to confirm that he was
dead because you dislike getting wet.

15:10.326 --> 15:14.365
Also, you were rash to have killed
him right away in the first place.

15:14.455 --> 15:19.575
What if Vegeta has concealed a
Dragon Ball from us someplace?

15:19.669 --> 15:23.503
I-I am terribly sorry. I will go check at once.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.830
Freeza-sama!

15:24.924 --> 15:27.586
I have discovered a village!

15:27.677 --> 15:31.090
H-However, the village has
already been wiped out!

15:31.180 --> 15:32.340
What did you say?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.139
I think it was most likely the work of Vegeta.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.638
Then he does have a
Dragon Ball somewhere after all!

15:37.729 --> 15:41.972
There was one villager still alive,
but I disposed of him at once.

15:43.026 --> 15:46.314
Then you killed our one and only witness?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.110
S-Sir...?

15:53.036 --> 15:57.279
I dislike hasty, unwise
actions more than anything.

15:57.373 --> 16:01.537
If Vegeta is dead, then you had
better prepare yourself, as well.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.085
Bring Vegeta back here at once.

16:04.172 --> 16:07.710
This time, you should set your
hopes on him being alive.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.177
Appule!

16:10.261 --> 16:11.216
Yes, sir?

16:11.304 --> 16:14.011
Contact Planet Freeza,

16:14.098 --> 16:18.307
and inform the Ginyu Special Corps
that they are to report here.

16:18.394 --> 16:22.137
And needless to say, tell them
to bring Scouters, as well.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.722
They should arrive in five days.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.069
Understood!

16:27.153 --> 16:31.442
F-Freeza-sama, why bring in
the Ginyu Special Corps?

16:31.532 --> 16:32.487
Forgive me for saying so,

16:32.575 --> 16:36.784
but I believe that there is
absolutely no reason to call them in.

16:36.871 --> 16:40.113
I am getting an unusual foreboding.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.699
W-What kind of foreboding?

16:42.794 --> 16:45.456
l have considered this for a little while now,

16:45.546 --> 16:48.083
but I have gotten the feeling that
a powerful Saiyan has grown up,

16:48.174 --> 16:51.337
who will become my enemy in time.

16:52.387 --> 16:56.221
At first, I thought it was Vegeta,
but it would seem that I am wrong.

16:56.307 --> 16:59.515
A-Are you sure you aren't imagining things?

16:59.602 --> 17:01.263
As far as Saiyans go, except for Vegeta,

17:01.354 --> 17:06.269
there is only that what's-his-name
on Earth, and his son.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.271
And their battle powers are
supposed to be lower than Vegeta's.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.855
Are you telling me that
my foreboding is misplaced?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.986
--N-No, sir!
--Never mind that.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.739
I would like you to bring
Vegeta back here at once.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.694
Y-Yes, sir!

17:25.420 --> 17:28.207
The Ginyu Special Corps...

17:28.297 --> 17:34.509
Saiyans do indeed appear to
possess fathomless battle power.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.382
Every time they battle, it rises greatly.

17:37.473 --> 17:41.011
Of course, they are no match for me,

17:41.102 --> 17:42.763
but thinking ahead to the future,

17:42.854 --> 17:45.937
I have to nip this in the bud now, while I can.

17:46.023 --> 17:51.108
It would be most inopportune if
one of them became a Super Saiyan.

18:05.376 --> 18:09.836
I slept pretty good. I wonder
how long I was asleep.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.470
It's no use! I'm so worn out, I can't move at all!

18:22.018 --> 18:24.930
Damn it...

18:25.021 --> 18:30.106
lam not... going to die...!

18:38.367 --> 18:41.734
W-What's this? He's still alive?

18:41.829 --> 18:43.569
You're a tough one.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.747
But then, this time, it's because
you're tough that I'll be spared.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.577
We're going to treat you. You're lucky.

19:02.308 --> 19:06.472
Say, Gohan-kun, look at this!

19:08.648 --> 19:10.809
One of the Dragon Balls started moving.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.266
It's coming straight toward us.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.602
Could that be Kuririn-kun?

19:15.696 --> 19:18.654
That must be it! Hooray!

19:18.741 --> 19:22.484
I'm sure he saw the Grand Elder, and got his ball!

19:22.578 --> 19:28.369
Hold on a second. Then what
is this other one, here?

19:30.545 --> 19:34.709
These five here are probably the
ones that that Freeza guy has, right?

19:34.799 --> 19:38.712
But look, there's one right here, all alone.

19:38.803 --> 19:42.637
Huh? You're right, and it's close to here.

19:42.723 --> 19:46.762
Let's see... in that direction, right?

19:52.400 --> 19:55.016
We said that Vegeta was
attacking a village, remember?

19:55.111 --> 19:58.023
It's in that direction!

19:58.114 --> 20:01.857
B-But Vegeta isn't there.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.656
I can't sense his Ki.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.954
I get it! He attacked the village,

20:09.041 --> 20:11.623
but wasn't able to find the Dragon Ball!

20:11.711 --> 20:12.700
Mm-hmm.

20:12.795 --> 20:17.755
He must have figured it wasn't there,
and went off someplace else.

20:17.842 --> 20:23.758
Please let me borrow the Radar.
I'm going to go get that Dragon Ball.

20:23.848 --> 20:28.262
Way to go! We caught a bit of luck, ourselves!

20:42.617 --> 20:45.905
--Well?
--His condition is quite serious, sir.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.656
His vital signs are extremely weak,

20:47.747 --> 20:49.703
and even if he completely
recovers from his injuries,

20:49.790 --> 20:51.997
I can't be sure he'll ever regain consciousness.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.790
Bring him around, no matter what it takes!

20:53.878 --> 20:55.960
Do everything possible for him! Got it?!

20:56.047 --> 20:57.628
Y-Yes, sir.

20:57.715 --> 21:01.378
Otherwise, it will mean my life.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.716
Great, great! Now's my chance!

21:09.810 --> 21:13.598
I don't sense the Ki of anyone scary nearby!

21:17.318 --> 21:22.733
The scramble for the Dragon Balls
becomes more and more chaotic.

21:22.823 --> 21:27.908
Who will be the one who laughs last?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.437 --> 22:35.973
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:36.063 --> 22:40.022
Who's got how many of the
Namekian Dragon Balls now?

22:40.109 --> 22:42.896
Freeza has five of them. Kuririn-san has one.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.820
If we can find the last one,
we'll have a chance, too!

22:45.906 --> 22:47.692
I'm the one whom luck is favoring!

22:47.783 --> 22:50.946
Zarbon, I'll get you back for
beating me half to death!

22:51.037 --> 22:52.823
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.913 --> 22:56.622
"The Scheme is Shattered!
Vegeta Strikes Back at Zarbon. ”

22:56.709 --> 23:00.201
I'm just about ready to try 100-times gravity!

23:01.305 --> 23:07.905
