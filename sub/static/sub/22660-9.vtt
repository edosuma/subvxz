00:23.755 --> 00:24.926
This is him?

00:25.264 --> 00:26.462
Reichenberg.

00:26.582 --> 00:28.749
Anatole Reichenberg.

00:28.869 --> 00:31.500
In Belarus, he is Vladislav Shushkevich,

00:31.511 --> 00:33.954
a family man who gives
money to the community.

00:33.990 --> 00:37.658
A man who hides in plain
sight is the hardest to find.

00:38.023 --> 00:40.494
I'm sure it wasn't easy to
raise this arrest warrant.

00:40.729 --> 00:43.463
Red tape is the same color everywhere.

00:44.398 --> 00:47.635
What kind of man sells counterfeit
medicine to sick children?

00:47.983 --> 00:50.828
His drugs have killed
seven kids in Marseille.

00:51.879 --> 00:54.541
Thank you for your persistence, Inspector.

00:54.742 --> 00:57.175
This monster must be stopped.

01:17.359 --> 01:18.409
Tarconi.

01:18.610 --> 01:20.661
I'm a lousy shot anyway.

01:20.688 --> 01:21.987
Reichenberg doesn't know that,

01:22.014 --> 01:23.396
and I would not look very good

01:23.414 --> 01:25.472
if I let something happen to you.

01:26.862 --> 01:28.682
You're sure he's inside?

01:28.802 --> 01:31.216
It's his new home, he thinks
he's meeting the contractor.

01:33.318 --> 01:35.738
Two years you have been
waiting to find this man.

01:35.742 --> 01:37.228
What's going through your head?

01:37.329 --> 01:39.026
Tomorrow, I go fishing.

02:24.397 --> 02:25.970
Ok clear.

02:33.326 --> 02:34.983
That's not him.

02:40.416 --> 02:41.380
Hey!

02:41.500 --> 02:42.620
Hey!

02:42.638 --> 02:44.028
I'm here!

02:44.056 --> 02:45.547
I'm in here!

02:56.747 --> 02:58.430
Oh, c'est pas vrai.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.467
Nom de Dieu.

03:11.711 --> 03:13.143
Gas.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.055
Merde.

03:32.152 --> 03:33.330
No!

03:33.579 --> 03:35.106
Merde!

03:35.152 --> 03:37.073
Merde!

05:23.738 --> 05:25.998
I'm looking for Nicole Emily.

05:26.363 --> 05:28.208
She's in makeup.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.810
Thank you.

06:41.429 --> 06:43.496
Evening ladies.

07:41.136 --> 07:42.605
Nicole Emily?

07:43.039 --> 07:43.940
Yes?

07:45.005 --> 07:46.386
Your videos.

07:48.088 --> 07:49.411
And this...

07:49.817 --> 07:51.380
What's that for?

07:51.500 --> 07:53.000
To burn them...

07:53.027 --> 07:55.578
before any websites
try stealing them again.

07:55.698 --> 07:58.041
You're the transporter.

07:58.324 --> 07:59.588
Thank you.

08:00.464 --> 08:01.407
Yeah?

08:01.443 --> 08:03.007
Frank, it's Cat.

08:03.035 --> 08:04.105
There's a problem.

08:04.225 --> 08:06.712
I'm really sorry, but it's about Marcel,

08:06.757 --> 08:08.229
Marcel Tarconi.

08:31.744 --> 08:32.878
Frank Martin?

08:32.998 --> 08:34.121
That's right.

08:34.405 --> 08:35.589
Come with me.

08:47.566 --> 08:50.264
Well, well, Inspector Tarconi.

08:50.859 --> 08:52.670
Still in one piece then?

08:53.658 --> 08:55.185
Merci.

08:55.305 --> 08:56.575
No problem.

08:56.969 --> 09:01.039
Elena has taken good care of
me. She's my angel of mercy.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.431
How could I resist such compliments?

09:05.081 --> 09:06.653
So, let me change that.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.178
It's a wonder you're still alive.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.815
They couldn't find my remains.

09:10.935 --> 09:13.176
And now my face is all over the news.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.528
Anyone else would turn me in.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.274
Why didn't you?

09:17.274 --> 09:19.862
The police say they're
worried about his safety,

09:19.982 --> 09:22.029
but offer a reward to turn him in?

09:23.639 --> 09:26.127
Everybody knows they're lying.

09:26.502 --> 09:28.277
You're gonna take him to the Embassy?

09:28.533 --> 09:30.307
No, they'll be watching the Embassy.

09:30.326 --> 09:31.533
And the airports.

09:31.653 --> 09:33.590
Bus and train stations...

09:33.710 --> 09:35.584
So, how are you going to get him over?

09:35.602 --> 09:36.956
Dig a tunnel?

09:37.194 --> 09:40.057
Clothes would get dirty.
I was thinking jet pack.

09:40.177 --> 09:42.334
Jet pack? What's a jet pack?

09:42.974 --> 09:44.648
Oh, jet pack, yeah.

09:44.768 --> 09:48.005
Jet pack is good. But I don't like heights.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.492
Oh, I guess we'll just have to drive then.

09:50.612 --> 09:53.318
Cat and Jules are waiting
across the border in Lithuania.

09:53.345 --> 09:55.028
But the police will be looking for you.

09:55.148 --> 09:57.754
Frank's done this kind of thing before.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.370
Elena!

10:01.641 --> 10:03.379
It's my neighbor.

10:03.589 --> 10:04.852
I'll take care of her.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.638
_

10:14.995 --> 10:17.199
_

10:17.437 --> 10:19.376
_

10:20.181 --> 10:22.349
_

10:23.144 --> 10:24.855
_

10:25.788 --> 10:27.901
_

10:29.154 --> 10:30.834
She likes you.

10:31.102 --> 10:32.511
You think so?

10:34.130 --> 10:36.640
If I was ten years younger...

10:37.980 --> 10:39.444
Ten years?

10:41.255 --> 10:42.709
_

10:48.160 --> 10:52.331
_

10:53.657 --> 10:58.999
_

10:59.255 --> 11:03.590
_

11:04.770 --> 11:07.047
_

11:08.154 --> 11:09.645
_

11:19.220 --> 11:21.708
I made a stupid mistake coming here.

11:21.717 --> 11:23.355
You had a warrant from Europol.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.254
Worthless in a country
like this, I knew that.

11:26.281 --> 11:27.919
Obviously you didn't.

11:27.919 --> 11:31.340
His fake medicine has
already killed seven kids.

11:31.460 --> 11:34.486
I had pictures of the children in my head.

11:34.742 --> 11:36.297
And now more will die.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.245
Why do you say that?

11:38.501 --> 11:40.569
Reichenberg has a shipment.

11:40.689 --> 11:41.885
Euphro.

11:42.141 --> 11:43.723
Euphro? Yes,

11:43.741 --> 11:45.946
some kind of code name for

11:46.066 --> 11:48.525
more fake medicine, going out tomorrow.

11:48.645 --> 11:50.700
- Where from?
- I don't know.

11:50.820 --> 11:52.264
If I arrested him,

11:52.483 --> 11:54.215
I could stop it.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.139
You never give up, do you, Marcel?

11:57.259 --> 11:59.387
Give up and you die, Frank.

12:00.957 --> 12:03.286
How can I repay you for this, Frank?

12:06.533 --> 12:08.226
I'll start you a tab.

12:11.399 --> 12:15.625
_

12:15.745 --> 12:19.238
_

12:22.477 --> 12:26.007
_

12:26.236 --> 12:28.056
_

12:30.461 --> 12:33.543
_

12:33.663 --> 12:35.683
_

12:35.720 --> 12:40.778
_

12:40.898 --> 12:46.174
_

12:51.909 --> 12:53.939
- You have to go.
- What is it?

12:54.059 --> 12:55.732
My neighbor called the police.

12:57.973 --> 12:59.382
You have a gun?

12:59.502 --> 13:00.662
The one they gave me.

13:01.101 --> 13:03.406
- You need to come with us.
- This is my home.

13:03.451 --> 13:04.897
They will punish you for helping me.

13:04.919 --> 13:07.256
Just leave before they get here.

13:28.228 --> 13:29.416
_

14:06.806 --> 14:08.718
They're catching up!

14:38.463 --> 14:40.073
What are you going to do?

14:40.477 --> 14:41.783
Watch.

14:46.116 --> 14:47.892
Oh my God!

14:54.224 --> 14:55.567
Nice trick.

15:01.310 --> 15:03.560
_

15:08.829 --> 15:11.674
_

15:43.228 --> 15:47.848
"Michael, look!" said Karl.
"There's a big bear in the yard.

15:47.866 --> 15:51.698
"A really scary one with
big teeth and claws."

15:58.814 --> 16:00.314
But Michael said,

16:00.434 --> 16:02.405
"I'm not afraid of you."

16:02.866 --> 16:05.226
And Karl saw it was true.

16:05.244 --> 16:07.037
Michael was not afraid.

16:07.157 --> 16:09.003
And he needn't be, either.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.635
Sorry, children.

16:13.836 --> 16:15.269
Can we stop for a moment, please?

16:15.470 --> 16:17.702
No!

16:18.343 --> 16:19.807
I'll be right back.

16:29.650 --> 16:30.845
Well?

16:32.353 --> 16:35.288
He was at the farmhouse, but he got away.

16:35.824 --> 16:38.454
How could you lose an old man? Twice?

16:39.326 --> 16:41.025
This man...

16:41.830 --> 16:44.309
entered the country under a false passport.

16:44.332 --> 16:47.638
We believe he is Frank
Martin, a transporter.

16:48.469 --> 16:51.443
Apparently he and this
Frenchman are friends.

16:52.092 --> 16:53.206
That's bad luck.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.241
And bad timing.

16:55.247 --> 16:57.479
If you're worried about
tomorrow, everything is in place,

16:57.488 --> 16:58.604
I assure you.

16:58.645 --> 17:00.863
You, a corrupt policeman
in a backward country...

17:00.909 --> 17:02.182
You assure me?

17:02.716 --> 17:05.436
I will not fail you, Mr. Reichenberg.

17:05.452 --> 17:07.118
You've already failed me once.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.021
And if you fail me again,

17:09.142 --> 17:11.253
who will make up for the millions I lose?

17:11.959 --> 17:13.914
Congratulations, by the way.

17:13.969 --> 17:16.164
- Congratulations?
- Yeah.

17:16.284 --> 17:17.290
Your wife.

17:17.492 --> 17:20.143
How far along is she?

17:20.711 --> 17:24.378
Only a few weeks, but we
have not even told anyone.

17:24.499 --> 17:26.065
Your first child, is it not?

17:26.767 --> 17:27.935
Yes.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.337
Family is a blessing.

17:30.735 --> 17:33.525
You must take care nothing happens to them.

17:37.044 --> 17:39.744
And catch that transporter.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.526
Why are we stopping?

17:53.757 --> 17:55.980
We're not going to get far
in a car registered to you.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.202
And frankly, this gearbox is killing me.

18:12.579 --> 18:13.511
Cat.

18:13.851 --> 18:16.704
I assume you know the
police are looking for you.

18:16.824 --> 18:19.988
His name's lit the last 20
minutes like a damn Christmas tree!

18:20.025 --> 18:22.659
I'm gonna need a new route
out of the country. Overland.

18:22.688 --> 18:24.823
He's going to need a new route.

18:24.943 --> 18:26.124
Where are you?

18:26.126 --> 18:27.873
We're about four clicks from the farmhouse.

18:27.910 --> 18:29.657
Tell Jules to triangulate
with my cellphone.

18:29.684 --> 18:31.660
I'm doing it. It'll be on
his phone n two minutes.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.032
He's doing it.

18:37.236 --> 18:38.370
That's not a bad job.

18:38.571 --> 18:40.313
From my Army days.

18:41.807 --> 18:43.606
Elena, we have to go now.

18:45.543 --> 18:47.666
I... I can't come with you.

18:47.786 --> 18:49.468
This is my fault.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.644
I should never have got you into this.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.884
Look...

18:53.285 --> 18:54.361
You had no choice.

18:54.388 --> 18:56.854
You shouldn't blame yourself.
I just want to go home now.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.023
The police know you hid me.

18:59.025 --> 19:00.591
If you go back, they will punish you.

19:00.711 --> 19:02.559
I know what the police will do.

19:02.761 --> 19:04.361
My husband was a journalist.

19:04.385 --> 19:06.918
He wrote stories about the
government and corruption.

19:06.936 --> 19:08.354
And now he's gone.

19:08.767 --> 19:10.659
What did they do to him?

19:11.080 --> 19:13.586
They just brought him in
for questioning one day.

19:13.605 --> 19:15.095
That was three years ago.

19:15.095 --> 19:16.943
I never saw him again.

19:16.970 --> 19:19.142
Then you can understand why
you need to come with us.

19:19.367 --> 19:22.166
This farm is where I grew up, Mr. Martin.

19:22.211 --> 19:23.501
This is my home.

19:23.519 --> 19:25.089
I know it's not easy.

19:25.093 --> 19:27.306
But you're going to
have to find a new home.

19:40.735 --> 19:42.363
_

19:42.600 --> 19:45.170
_

20:04.414 --> 20:07.158
_

20:15.014 --> 20:16.267
_

20:16.514 --> 20:19.130
- _
- _

20:19.250 --> 20:21.399
_

20:34.296 --> 20:36.198
Do you have to make that noise?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.269
What noise?

20:37.296 --> 20:39.089
Your gum. It's snapping.

20:39.355 --> 20:41.121
It's nicotine gum. I'm trying to quit.

20:41.322 --> 20:43.991
- You prefer that I smoked in here?
- Yes.

20:47.713 --> 20:48.896
What is it?

20:49.097 --> 20:51.766
That cop chasing Frank and Tarconi.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.468
It turns out his name is Dobry Drozd.

20:54.482 --> 20:56.723
And he's made five calls
in the past hour to...

20:56.843 --> 20:58.836
Druskininkai.

20:59.073 --> 21:01.956
- Druskinin-what?
- It's a village.

21:02.076 --> 21:03.810
What does that mean?

21:03.849 --> 21:05.126
I don't know, I'm just wondering why

21:05.157 --> 21:06.986
he's suddenly so interested in the place.

21:07.644 --> 21:09.044
How far is it?

21:11.486 --> 21:13.187
Depending on how you drive.

21:23.284 --> 21:25.543
Too late for that jet pack?

21:26.266 --> 21:28.001
Okay, let's rest for a minute.

21:28.497 --> 21:30.171
Good idea.

21:30.803 --> 21:32.171
Tired?

21:32.372 --> 21:34.040
I'm alright. I just need to sit down.

21:38.445 --> 21:40.195
You're flirting with her!

21:40.213 --> 21:42.015
I asked her if she was tired.

21:42.049 --> 21:44.073
She won't sleep with you.

21:44.193 --> 21:45.308
You're jealous.

21:45.336 --> 21:46.818
I saw her first.

21:46.938 --> 21:48.820
You're old enough to be her grandfather.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.384
Grandfather.

21:55.494 --> 21:57.436
Why did you come here?

21:58.177 --> 22:00.065
To arrest a very bad man.

22:00.466 --> 22:01.790
What did he do?

22:02.385 --> 22:04.809
He kills sick children.

22:12.483 --> 22:13.306
How?

22:13.507 --> 22:15.492
He makes fake pills,

22:15.514 --> 22:17.111
sells them to hospitals

22:17.149 --> 22:19.416
who treat children with leukemia.

22:19.855 --> 22:22.343
Doctors believe they
are curing the children,

22:22.388 --> 22:24.245
but they are only watching them die.

22:25.269 --> 22:27.657
And the police here know that?

22:28.397 --> 22:29.879
It's big business.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.507
They get a cut.

22:32.257 --> 22:35.348
He has another shipment going out tomorrow.

22:38.436 --> 22:40.643
If only I could stop it.

22:44.942 --> 22:46.936
No wonder you want to kill this man.

22:46.964 --> 22:48.848
I don't want to kill anyone.

22:49.414 --> 22:51.548
Forty years a cop,

22:51.884 --> 22:54.793
and you know how many times I fired my gun?

22:54.913 --> 22:56.100
Only once.

22:56.653 --> 22:57.784
Once.

22:59.156 --> 23:01.405
What I remember most...

23:01.717 --> 23:03.116
the sound...

23:04.061 --> 23:06.849
The bullet piercing his chest.

23:08.398 --> 23:10.534
Not a day goes by,

23:10.654 --> 23:12.171
I don't hear it.

23:17.073 --> 23:18.903
You're a policeman, too?

23:19.676 --> 23:20.776
Not exactly.

23:21.011 --> 23:23.100
No. Frank is a transporter.

23:23.220 --> 23:24.975
A transporter?

23:25.581 --> 23:27.271
I deliver things.

23:28.021 --> 23:29.585
Like this fellow here.

23:30.820 --> 23:32.237
That must be dangerous.

23:32.283 --> 23:33.588
It can be.

23:34.021 --> 23:38.238
When I first met Frank, he
was helping some bank robbers.

23:39.061 --> 23:40.662
But I liked him,

23:40.707 --> 23:42.578
so I let him go.

23:42.698 --> 23:44.432
You let me go?

23:44.552 --> 23:46.615
- Yeah.
- Now, I've heard everything.

23:46.735 --> 23:49.314
If I wanted you, you would go down.

23:49.434 --> 23:51.710
Keep telling yourself
that if it makes you happy.

23:51.738 --> 23:52.908
I had him.

23:53.028 --> 23:54.088
He knows it.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.684
_

24:18.711 --> 24:22.634
_

24:22.653 --> 24:26.238
_

24:26.256 --> 24:28.881
_

24:31.872 --> 24:35.814
_

24:50.431 --> 24:51.894
There.

24:53.133 --> 24:54.701
Are you going to steal it?

24:54.710 --> 24:57.180
Unless you know of a Jeep
dealership around here.

24:57.404 --> 24:59.004
You'd better stay out of sight.

24:59.240 --> 25:00.847
I'll stand like a tree.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.042
Come with me, in case we
need to do any talking.

25:03.244 --> 25:05.283
If you see anyone, shoot them.

25:05.746 --> 25:07.277
Sure, Frank.

25:07.296 --> 25:08.823
Good plan.

25:18.353 --> 25:21.774
_

25:22.469 --> 25:25.771
_

25:25.780 --> 25:28.112
_

26:07.716 --> 26:09.692
- Papa!
- Sssh!

26:12.243 --> 26:14.247
You don't need to be afraid.

26:14.913 --> 26:16.280
Trust me.

26:16.844 --> 26:19.213
You don't want the police in your home.

26:19.951 --> 26:22.268
How sharp are your eyes?

26:31.529 --> 26:33.117
Ooooh...

26:36.291 --> 26:37.644
Ooooh...

26:39.269 --> 26:41.467
Where did that come from?

26:48.208 --> 26:49.068
Blow.

26:49.188 --> 26:50.403
Souffle.

27:04.351 --> 27:05.567
That's for you.

27:05.687 --> 27:06.948
Ssssh...

27:08.231 --> 27:11.091
You never saw me, understand?

27:15.893 --> 27:18.106
Can't I leave you alone for five minutes?

27:18.462 --> 27:19.816
Give me a second.

27:27.892 --> 27:30.664
I just told him not to
tell anyone that he saw us.

27:34.368 --> 27:37.002
He just wants to know why
we've got his Daddy's car.

27:38.923 --> 27:40.167
Good-bye.

27:40.807 --> 27:42.444
It's time to go.

27:57.078 --> 27:58.323
This is the place.

27:58.359 --> 28:00.289
Drus-kin-in-kai.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.606
Perfect! A complete dead end.

28:13.628 --> 28:16.195
It's just a truck yard.
A complete waste of time.

28:16.231 --> 28:18.837
Can you shut up? I'm trying to think.

28:18.957 --> 28:20.758
I thought Italians were
supposed to be easy-going.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.735
I'm French and Italian.

28:22.855 --> 28:24.203
Looks like you got the best of both.

28:24.405 --> 28:26.205
What's that supposed to mean?

28:26.237 --> 28:27.807
It means you're uptight like the French,

28:27.808 --> 28:29.520
and hot-tempered like the Italians.

28:31.166 --> 28:32.557
Actually, kind of sexy.

28:34.014 --> 28:35.381
You want to live?

28:35.983 --> 28:37.395
Don't ever say that again.

28:37.717 --> 28:38.958
Right.

28:39.708 --> 28:41.355
They're leaving.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.270
Yeah, without any cargo. So what?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.473
So they're going to pick
something up, genius.

28:46.593 --> 28:48.799
Can you fit a tracker on one of those?

28:50.764 --> 28:52.879
Superior GPS-receiving sensitivity,

28:52.999 --> 28:55.310
quad-band modem, GSM frequencies.

28:55.310 --> 28:56.600
Is that a yes, Julian?

28:56.720 --> 28:58.247
Yeah. In my sleep.

28:58.271 --> 28:59.871
Twice on Sunday. Of course.

29:00.259 --> 29:01.739
Where d'you think they're going anyway?

29:01.859 --> 29:04.457
I don't know. That's
what I want to find out.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.347
- Now what are you waiting for?
- Okay...

29:07.667 --> 29:08.957
I'm going.

29:20.408 --> 29:21.332
Go!

29:33.213 --> 29:34.576
Shit!

29:35.106 --> 29:37.530
Totally not like this in the movies!

29:42.346 --> 29:44.417
What the hell is he doing?

30:23.454 --> 30:25.091
Bumpy ride.

30:26.656 --> 30:28.613
You got any more magic tricks?

30:31.128 --> 30:32.546
You okay?

30:36.799 --> 30:38.162
She's okay!

30:52.358 --> 30:53.327
What?

30:53.336 --> 30:55.096
I wanted to stay off-road
the whole way but...

30:55.216 --> 30:57.141
the car can't handle it.

30:59.153 --> 31:00.644
But...

31:16.824 --> 31:20.273
_

31:20.393 --> 31:23.703
_

31:23.740 --> 31:25.706
_

31:25.826 --> 31:27.673
_

31:27.993 --> 31:29.832
_

31:29.952 --> 31:33.152
_

31:33.371 --> 31:34.899
_

31:36.801 --> 31:38.594
_

31:45.674 --> 31:47.695
_

31:48.491 --> 31:50.979
_

31:57.290 --> 31:59.275
_

32:00.711 --> 32:02.357
_

32:07.598 --> 32:09.327
_

32:11.183 --> 32:13.003
_

32:16.716 --> 32:20.082
_

32:26.721 --> 32:28.843
_

32:31.504 --> 32:33.132
_

32:33.252 --> 32:36.516
_

32:37.111 --> 32:39.470
_

32:45.526 --> 32:46.761
Oh, no.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.306
Can you get past them?

32:48.426 --> 32:49.962
Not a chance.

32:50.968 --> 32:53.344
- We've got trouble.
- Hold on.

32:53.464 --> 32:55.031
What are you doing?

32:55.151 --> 32:57.993
Oh God!

33:03.408 --> 33:04.734
Get down!

33:20.290 --> 33:21.739
What's Frank doing?

33:21.859 --> 33:23.440
If the policeman gets away,

33:23.560 --> 33:25.478
he'll radio our position.

34:42.829 --> 34:44.567
Everything alright?

35:15.543 --> 35:18.031
Sorry, Jules. Gotta go.

35:46.523 --> 35:48.050
Okay, okay.

35:55.999 --> 35:57.984
Okay, yeah.

36:27.215 --> 36:29.776
This is where they'll be
expecting us to cross the border.

36:29.794 --> 36:31.468
Thanks to your note.

36:35.035 --> 36:37.313
_

36:39.417 --> 36:40.907
We're not far now.

36:40.944 --> 36:42.452
You're very brave.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.836
You were brave, helping Marcel.

36:45.956 --> 36:48.664
One of the bravest people I've ever met.

36:50.728 --> 36:52.889
I'm still afraid to leave my home.

36:53.263 --> 36:54.697
It feels like...

36:54.899 --> 36:56.533
leaving behind my husband.

36:56.734 --> 36:58.515
He's dead, I know that.

36:58.635 --> 37:01.669
But if I was home, I could...

37:02.072 --> 37:04.459
imagine he'd be back one day.

37:17.019 --> 37:19.120
We're all set, Frank.

37:29.153 --> 37:30.370
I can't.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.958
You can. You've come this far.

37:32.976 --> 37:34.266
My husband...

37:34.470 --> 37:35.870
I belong here.

37:36.205 --> 37:38.162
We're not going to leave you.

37:40.046 --> 37:41.940
You have to, I'm sorry.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.992
Give us a minute.

37:50.285 --> 37:52.167
Hey. Where's Jules?

37:52.287 --> 37:54.436
I just spoke to him. He's stuck in a truck.

37:54.556 --> 37:56.071
He's outside an old monastery...

37:56.108 --> 37:57.792
Saint Euphrosyne the Holy.

37:57.993 --> 37:59.861
What did you say?

37:59.981 --> 38:02.196
- What's the name again?
- Saint Euphrosyne.

38:02.464 --> 38:05.313
Euphrosyne... Euphro.
Frank, it's the code name.

38:05.433 --> 38:07.652
Reichenberg's shipment.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.513
Frank! Where are you?

38:22.559 --> 38:23.517
We're outside.

38:23.818 --> 38:25.303
Great, come get me.

38:25.423 --> 38:27.205
Working on it. What do you see?

38:30.654 --> 38:33.050
A bunch of badass-looking
dudes with shotguns.

38:33.460 --> 38:34.934
How many?

38:35.556 --> 38:37.642
I don't know, maybe six.

38:38.632 --> 38:40.212
How many bullets left in that gun?

38:40.400 --> 38:41.502
One.

38:42.883 --> 38:44.145
Cat, what do you have?

38:44.404 --> 38:45.718
Breath mints.

38:49.093 --> 38:51.096
- Oh, crap!
- What?

38:51.310 --> 38:52.394
I'm toast!

38:56.319 --> 38:58.376
_

38:58.496 --> 38:59.456
No, no!

39:00.033 --> 39:01.158
Don't shoot!

39:01.278 --> 39:02.859
Okay, okay!

39:04.112 --> 39:06.060
No speakee Russki!

39:16.679 --> 39:18.893
You stay here. You two come with me.

39:44.501 --> 39:47.126
_

39:47.172 --> 39:48.846
English. Kinda.

39:48.966 --> 39:50.602
You work with the transporter.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.495
Yeah. How did you know?

39:54.736 --> 39:57.123
I shouldn't have said that, should I?

40:06.349 --> 40:07.549
Yes?

40:08.062 --> 40:10.495
The note you received, it was a ruse.

40:11.154 --> 40:12.955
What are you talking about?

40:12.965 --> 40:14.776
The transporter's not headed to the border.

40:15.024 --> 40:16.111
He's here.

40:16.687 --> 40:18.361
I'm on my way.

40:19.257 --> 40:22.092
_

40:41.518 --> 40:43.256
It's the counterfeits alright.

40:43.376 --> 40:44.552
Got any ideas?

40:44.820 --> 40:46.704
I was hoping you might.

41:02.007 --> 41:03.928
Is that gasoline?

41:05.507 --> 41:07.925
We have a plan...

42:09.269 --> 42:10.815
Thanks.

42:17.710 --> 42:19.027
Putain.

42:29.812 --> 42:31.389
Merde.

42:35.437 --> 42:38.410
A board? What good is that going to do you?

42:38.530 --> 42:40.815
Wait and see.

42:40.861 --> 42:42.300
Five.

42:42.420 --> 42:44.639
Out of bullets.

42:44.657 --> 42:45.781
I thought so.

43:08.408 --> 43:10.109
_

43:15.287 --> 43:18.927
_

43:19.047 --> 43:21.149
_

43:21.269 --> 43:23.637
_

43:23.656 --> 43:26.199
_

43:27.378 --> 43:28.906
_

43:35.947 --> 43:39.057
_

43:39.295 --> 43:42.084
_

43:46.963 --> 43:48.378
You take those.

43:48.706 --> 43:49.904
Go on.

44:10.090 --> 44:11.837
Put it down!

45:00.101 --> 45:02.105
All done, Frank.

45:03.938 --> 45:05.343
Stop!

45:08.976 --> 45:10.465
Sorry, Frank.

45:11.032 --> 45:12.386
No worries.

45:12.651 --> 45:14.252
Was it worth it, Inspector?

45:14.282 --> 45:16.090
Stopping you? Of course.

45:16.210 --> 45:18.418
But you haven't stopped me. Not at all.

45:18.819 --> 45:20.462
Set down the petrol.

45:28.045 --> 45:29.462
Let him go.

45:35.501 --> 45:37.536
You're not going to shoot me, Mr. Martin.

45:39.205 --> 45:41.206
Kill him, you're a torch.

45:42.541 --> 45:44.553
And if I kill her, too?

45:46.246 --> 45:48.175
Look what I found outside.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.264
Drop it, Mr. Martin.

45:51.384 --> 45:53.425
Or they both die.

45:56.845 --> 45:57.989
It's okay, Frank.

45:58.458 --> 46:00.325
He told me my husband is dead.

46:00.526 --> 46:02.470
Yeah, but you're not.

46:22.208 --> 46:24.083
That makes two.

46:35.323 --> 46:36.823
Are you ready?

46:37.966 --> 46:39.375
I'm ready.

46:40.064 --> 46:42.430
I'm ready to leave this place.
