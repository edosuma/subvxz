- Hi.
- Gosh, I love those shoes!

11:35.413 --> 11:36.793
- Oh, thank you.
- Come in, you look gorgeous.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.413
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:38.482 --> 11:41.931
Um, this is my roommate Josh,
and that's Maggie.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.758
- Malkie.

11:44.827 --> 11:46.379
- What, do you two
know each other?

11:46.448 --> 11:49.034
- Yeah, we used to go out.

11:49.103 --> 11:50.689
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

11:50.758 --> 11:52.137
Oh, well, you know,
it's a small community.

11:52.206 --> 11:54.379
Okay, let me take your coat.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.620
And, uh, is red wine
okay with you?

11:58.896 --> 12:01.241
- Mm.
- So, Maggie.

12:01.310 --> 12:03.310
When do you plan
to put your tomatoes in?

12:03.379 --> 12:05.413
- Oh, I'm not doing
the community garden this year.

12:05.482 --> 12:07.206
I'm going to do
a rooftop garden.

12:07.275 --> 12:09.310
- Oh, that sounds right.

12:09.379 --> 12:11.586
- Just that you seem to like

12:11.655 --> 12:13.137

that's all.

12:16.517 --> 12:18.241
- Uh, it's de--

12:18.310 --> 12:20.000
- Malkie, if you've got
something to say to me,

12:20.068 --> 12:21.896
why don't you say it
to my face?

12:21.965 --> 12:23.758
- Okay.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.724
You're a middle-aged woman
who's scared to let anyone in.

12:26.793 --> 12:30.482
You love the fun of the chase,
but you never want to get real.

12:33.551 --> 12:35.275

- Maggie--
- It's what you do best.

12:38.655 --> 12:41.034
Oof, uh...

12:41.103 --> 12:42.896
You okay?

12:42.965 --> 12:45.103
- Yeah, I just--
Call me tomorrow.

I am so sorry.

to just, like--

It's okay.

she really hurt you, huh?

13:12.551 --> 13:17.137
Don't make fun, but there's
this carousel in Battery Park--

13:17.206 --> 13:18.965
What's wrong?

13:22.034 --> 13:23.965
- Lauren...

13:24.034 --> 13:26.103
is Malkie's new girlfriend.

13:26.172 --> 13:29.758
- Yep.

with her.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.344

I know I did.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.310
- Oh, Maggie.

13:36.379 --> 13:38.172
I know.

13:38.241 --> 13:41.551
And--and she said
I had issues.

13:41.620 --> 13:44.137
Do you think I have issues?

13:44.206 --> 13:46.689
- We all have issues.

13:46.758 --> 13:49.068
We're all scared
to put our hearts out there.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.620

when we risk

13:52.689 --> 13:56.344

too.

it may be underserved
by such a--

17:07.862 --> 17:10.620

Kate and Karl would split up.
Why?

18:16.724 --> 18:20.965
- Well, Kate discovers that
her husband is secretly in love

18:21.034 --> 18:23.000
with someone else.

18:24.517 --> 18:27.482
- A two-faced young assistant
in his company.

- Oh...my God.

to a more accomplished woman.

18:36.275 --> 18:38.517
You know, someone who is
at least department head.

18:38.586 --> 18:40.517
- Mm.
- Right, you might think so.

18:40.586 --> 18:44.965
But this assistant
is so cheerful

18:45.034 --> 18:47.517
and innocent-looking,
she charms everyone

18:47.586 --> 18:48.931
in the company.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.172
I mean, she's the kind
of woman who smiles

18:51.241 --> 18:54.586
right in Kate's face;
even pretends they're friends.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.793
And she steals her husband

18:56.862 --> 18:59.206
and takes him away
from his children.

18:59.275 --> 19:01.620
- Oh, this is good.
Shailene Woodley

19:01.689 --> 19:03.413
is gonna eat this up.
- Mm-hmm.

19:03.482 --> 19:06.827
- Maybe the assistant
was actually trying

19:06.896 --> 19:10.896
to help Kate and Karl
repair their marriage.

19:10.965 --> 19:13.137
- That's a stretch.

19:13.206 --> 19:15.517
- Uh--W--Go on.
- Maybe the assistant

19:15.586 --> 19:20.275
was doing everything she could
to help them get back together.

19:20.344 --> 19:25.103
But Karl couldn't get over
the fact that Kate left him

19:25.172 --> 19:29.827
and left her own children
for an entire year.

19:29.896 --> 19:33.137
- Yes, well, that is the--
the comforting fantasy

19:33.206 --> 19:35.172
that the assistant
tells herself at night.

19:35.241 --> 19:38.827
- Not just comforting,
but truthful.

19:38.896 --> 19:40.413
To the characters.

19:40.482 --> 19:42.586
- Yeah. I'm not buying it.

19:42.655 --> 19:45.931
I think my version
is more believable.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.068
And I think that when Kate
finds out about the affair,

19:51.137 --> 19:53.827
she might want revenge.

19:53.896 --> 19:55.448
- Yes!
- No.

19:55.517 --> 19:57.724
I don't think that the audience
would like that.

19:57.793 --> 20:00.034
- Think they might want it.

20:00.103 --> 20:01.482
- Liza, stop telling Pauline
what to write.

20:01.551 --> 20:02.586
- Oh, that's okay.

20:02.655 --> 20:05.103
That's okay.
It's always...

20:05.172 --> 20:08.310
interesting to hear
another point of view.

20:08.379 --> 20:10.793

20:17.034 --> 20:19.172

20:23.379 --> 20:25.172
- Yeah, of course.

20:25.241 --> 20:28.137
- What do you think
about making Devereux's book

20:28.206 --> 20:30.068
an Empirical title?

20:30.137 --> 20:31.931
Makes sense
from a marketing perspective,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.965

wasn't a part of the process.

20:36.034 --> 20:39.586

a big hand in the--

20:39.655 --> 20:42.241

right?

20:42.310 --> 20:45.620

20:45.689 --> 20:48.655

invented that book.
