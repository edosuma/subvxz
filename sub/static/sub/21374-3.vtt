00:06.590 --> 00:07.590
[Bontrager] <i>Ready?</i>

00:08.759 --> 00:13.096
Baby, monkey, perfume, sunset, iron.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.850
Baby, monkey, perfume, sunset, iron.

00:16.934 --> 00:22.147
Okay. Gonna test it again.
Baby, monkey, perfume, sunset, iron.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.859
Baby, monkey, perfume, sunset, iron.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.779
- Okay. Good. What month is it?
- September.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.448
- Okay. What year is it?
- '16.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.909
- What day of the week?
- Uh, Monday.

00:33.992 --> 00:37.233
I'm gonna read you a string of numbers.
I want you to repeat them to me backwards.

00:37.746 --> 00:41.124
Six, one, eight, four, three.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.711
Three, four, six...

00:45.379 --> 00:48.173
eight, one? No. One, eight.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.634
[Bontrager] <i>Diagnosing a concussion</i>
<i>is the hardest part.</i>

00:50.718 --> 00:55.263
The brain could still be bruised,
but that wouldn't show up on a CT scan.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.515
<i>Like, Isaiah's CT scan was normal.</i>

00:58.266 --> 00:59.266
All right.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.812
We're gonna try
a non-contact practice today,

01:02.396 --> 01:03.647
and we're gonna see how you do.

01:03.731 --> 01:07.067
<i>I would much rather have, you know,
a sprained ankle or a torn ligament</i>

01:07.150 --> 01:11.321
on the knee because you have
diagnostic tests that can confirm that.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.074
<i>You have your MRis and X-rays.</i>

01:14.157 --> 01:16.577
<i>It's hard to diagnose a concussion,</i>

01:16.660 --> 01:19.872
because you have to go by
what the athlete is saying, um...

01:20.706 --> 01:22.750
because you can't always
see their symptoms.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.710
[Trickett] <i>First days feel foggy,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

01:25.711 --> 01:28.922
And when you're in a...
uh, concussed state, it's like you're...

01:29.673 --> 01:33.176
You're not drunk, but you're damn near
close to it, you know.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.722
That's actually
what doctors describe it as.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.767
A state of drunkenness, you know.
It happens.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.394
- Good?
- [chuckles]

01:42.477 --> 01:44.647
[marching band playing]

02:17.012 --> 02:20.015
[Wagner] Would you go to football practice
without a helmet and pads?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.852
- And, like, let somebody hit you?
- [player] No.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.478
No, you would not.

02:25.562 --> 02:29.607
Do not walk into class in the morning,
or any day, with nothing.

02:29.692 --> 02:33.111
You have got to have a pencil.
You have got to have paper.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.362
Play the game.

02:34.946 --> 02:38.367
When teachers are putting those grades
in the computer, they're human beings.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.536
And when we see your name,
we see your face.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.371
It's easy to flunk an asshole.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.333
You go in and you act
like a jerk every day...

02:47.167 --> 02:50.462
and you sleep and you pull your phone out
and you act like you don't care...

02:50.545 --> 02:53.066
the teacher ain't gonna care
when they're putting that grade in.

02:53.215 --> 02:57.302
Half the battle
is somebody just liking ya.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.305
Man, what'd I tell you?
Get all your foot in the ground.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.851
- [coach] Set, hit!
- [grunting]

03:03.934 --> 03:06.436
- [coach] Stack! Stack!
- [whistle blows]

03:06.519 --> 03:08.063
[Williams] Hustle back, hustle back!

03:08.146 --> 03:11.066
Damn it, son, do you understand
what we just told you to do?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.986
- [Kam] I was trying.
- Well, don't try! Do it, son! Do it!

03:14.069 --> 03:15.320
[coach] Don't try, do it!

03:15.403 --> 03:17.948
[Williams] That's some bullshit, man.
You can't get lined up.

03:19.742 --> 03:23.203
- Hey, get ready to practice, Kam.
- [panting] Yes, sir.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.997
Snap out of that shit.
Whatever going on, snap out of it.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.628
[Williams] There you go.
Run, run, run!

03:31.711 --> 03:34.297
- [whistle blows]
- [Williams] Hey, hey. You had him.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.049
Swim across that thing.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.347
You got a Black?

03:43.015 --> 03:44.391
I don't smoke.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.312
What you going around
asking for a Black for

03:49.396 --> 03:50.605
and you can't finish a drill?

03:50.688 --> 03:52.900
- The fuck you mean?
- Huh?

03:52.983 --> 03:54.818
When the fuck couldn't I finish a drill?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.611
- Like, never.
- When?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.072
- Say one time.
- What?

03:59.156 --> 04:01.658
- Say one time, man.
- Like, yesterday.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.702
- The snake.
- [clicks tongue] Nigga, I did that shit.

04:04.787 --> 04:06.246
On your time.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.999
'Cause that's what they say.
Run it on your pace.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.543
Did they not say run at your own pace?

04:11.626 --> 04:12.878
- No!
- Maleke!

04:12.961 --> 04:15.213
- Did they not say run at your own pace?
- Dude! No!

04:15.297 --> 04:16.818
Well, you ain't been here long enough.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.110
- I ain't be here long enough?
- You ain't been here long enough.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.719
- And I been here longer than your ass.
- Hey, fool.

04:21.804 --> 04:23.721
Trying to get
a motherfuckin' Black, nigga.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.474
You can't find a dollar?

04:26.558 --> 04:30.938
Go ask Coach. Go tell Coach,
"I need a dollar for a Black & Mild."

04:32.147 --> 04:33.982
[Kam] Coach know I smoke that shit.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.985
I don't smoke weed, though.
So that's good.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.489
[Wagner] You were doing your midterm
critical analysis today, were you not?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.426
- [Kam] I know. I finished it. I...
- You didn't.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.344
- I will.
- She e-mailed me and said you did not.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.704
You just walked out
in the middle of class.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.004
That you said you didn't wanna
write your paper. You said you were done.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.127
If she hadn't have contacted me,
you would have gotten a zero.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.089
And the fact that she contacted you,
that means she care.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.173
Sit up, man.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.425
Why... I don't understand
the thought process.

05:00.508 --> 05:04.054
Like, you're sitting in there, you've done
everything you were supposed to do.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.931
[clicks tongue] My phone broke.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.851
[Wagner stammers] Okay. Okay. And...

05:08.934 --> 05:11.311
That's what blows me,
it made me mad.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.188
I couldn't even focus to write the paper.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.608
I sat there for a good ten minutes
after I broke my phone.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.277
And I just...
I couldn't think of anything, 'cause...

05:19.361 --> 05:21.404
I'm just sitting there
thinking about my phone.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.448
[Wagner] Okay. Is the phone a big deal?

05:23.532 --> 05:26.827
Yeah, it's a big deal. I get it.
Y'all are attached to your phone.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.121
Your whole livelihood is on your phone.
I get it.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.206
But that phone working today

05:31.289 --> 05:34.251
doesn't have a damn thing to do
with the rest of your life.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.879
You making this teacher mad...

05:37.462 --> 05:39.381
will impact the rest of your life.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.134
Like, you were in a great mood,
you were doing your work...

05:42.217 --> 05:45.178
Why when we do good
do we have to sabotage?

05:45.262 --> 05:46.263
[Kam] I don't know.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.067
[Williams] You need to be finding
an answer.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.685
'Cause if you don't, then you gonna ruin
the rest of your life, son.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.854
[Kam] So, I'm only happy, you know.

05:54.938 --> 05:55.772
I mean...

05:55.855 --> 05:57.774
I don't handle bad stuff too well.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.237
[Wagner] But let's look at it as
when the bad stuff happens...

06:03.238 --> 06:04.823
you can make it worse,

06:05.323 --> 06:07.659
- or you can make it better.
- Mm-hmm.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.463
[Wagner] 'Cause some of the bad,
you create.

06:09.912 --> 06:12.872
Okay.
She says you can come by after lunch.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.501
- [sighs deeply]
- So, can you go at 1:00?

06:17.585 --> 06:19.879
- Yeah.
- [Wagner] Why the deep breath?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.466
[Kam] 'Cause I was about to go to Meridian
to get my phone...

06:23.550 --> 06:25.135
to get it turned on.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.095
Your phone can wait, man.

06:28.263 --> 06:29.623
- [Wagner] We good?
- [Kam] Mm-hmm.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.558
[Williams] Yes, ma'am.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.642
Yes, ma'am.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.145
[Wagner] Okay.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.730
Let's go.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.275
- Hmm?
- We're good.

06:40.984 --> 06:41.985
All right.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.989
- One o'clock.
- [Kam] I know.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.035
[Wagner] So negative!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.411
- [Williams] Who?
- You!

06:51.494 --> 06:52.870
How was I negative?

06:52.955 --> 06:57.459
Just getting on to him.
Just... calm your ass down.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.938
- [Williams] Whatever.
- [Wagner chuckles]

06:59.962 --> 07:00.795
[groans]

07:00.878 --> 07:03.465
He needs to understand reality, too.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.343
Life ain't always gonna be
about second chances.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.512
You need to get it right the first time.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.850
<i>This hasn't happened in a while.
I mean, he's gotten better.</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:18.355
Every week, mentally, attitude-wise,
he's come out to practice happy.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.814
He's played well.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.001
[Crowder] <i>It's thrown</i>
<i>over the middle, intercepted by EMCC!</i>

07:22.025 --> 07:23.026
<i>And it's a big boy.</i>

07:23.110 --> 07:26.196
[Winfield] <i>Kam Carter again,</i>
<i>he has been dominant in the middle.</i>

07:26.279 --> 07:27.465
[Williams] <i>He had a great game.</i>

07:27.489 --> 07:31.451
<i>He had a SEC-caliber
defensive lineman game.</i>

07:31.534 --> 07:34.871
<i>But he has
his I-don't-care attitude sometimes.</i>

07:34.955 --> 07:38.291
I've learned that I can't chew him out.

07:38.375 --> 07:43.171
But I had to be stern in talking to him
about why he's doing what he's doing.

07:43.255 --> 07:48.051
Let's not revert back to the things that,
you know, we left behind.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.850
[Kam] <i>I wasn't the ideal player,</i>
<i>I guess you could say.</i>

07:56.393 --> 07:58.686
<i>I got into a lot of trouble,
my freshman year.</i>

07:58.770 --> 08:00.355
<i>I failed two drug tests.</i>

08:00.438 --> 08:04.151
And then, you know,
I mean, I pretty much knew then...

08:04.859 --> 08:07.029
that that was the end of the road
right there.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.240
<i>I have, like, ADHD, so...</i>

08:10.991 --> 08:14.244
<i>I take a lot of medication, so I mean...</i>

08:14.327 --> 08:18.790
<i>My philosophy behind using it was
if all these medications that they...</i>

08:18.873 --> 08:21.543
that the doctors prescribe me,
making me sluggish,

08:21.626 --> 08:24.504
making me not wanna do what I wanna do,
making me, you know...

08:25.380 --> 08:28.508
not be what I need to be at my craft...

08:29.176 --> 08:35.765
why take it when there's an alternative
where I can just smoke this J, you know?

08:35.848 --> 08:39.894
And then I wanna go to practice,
I wanna be active, you know.

08:39.978 --> 08:42.230
<i>I don't have to take
all these fucking pills.</i>

08:42.439 --> 08:45.900
<i>I mean, I felt like it was a no-brainer
to me, but,</i>

08:45.984 --> 08:49.237
I mean, it's illegal,
so, you know, you can't do that.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.121
[Latoya Carter] <i>I raised him</i>
<i>until he was seven,</i>

08:54.159 --> 08:56.703
<i>and I was still a teenager, you know.</i>

08:56.786 --> 09:00.915
<i>And the school would always call
and say he was into this and he was,</i>

09:00.998 --> 09:02.542
<i>you know, misbehaving.</i>

09:02.625 --> 09:05.170
It was hard to keep him focused
and sitting at his desk.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.506
He wanted to be here and he wanted
to be there and playing this and...

09:08.590 --> 09:10.717
You know, his attention span
was really short.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.635
And I didn't know, because I was so young.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.722
I'd never even heard
of ADHD at that point.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.602
[Aaron Carter] <i>It started early.</i>
<i>I knew he was gonna be a big kid.</i>

09:20.685 --> 09:22.895
Uh, he wanted to throw the football,
you know.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.398
Running around the backyard,
push him down, jump right up.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.067
<i>He wanted to be the tough kid.</i>

09:27.150 --> 09:30.153
<i>Which, you know, as a coach,
I know that's what you need.</i>

09:31.279 --> 09:33.823
<i>I started training him
his eighth-grade year,</i>

09:33.906 --> 09:38.370
<i>so he was already lifting weights
at the strength of a high school player.</i>

09:38.453 --> 09:41.373
<i>And by his tenth-grade year,
the floodgates opened.</i>

09:41.456 --> 09:45.835
<i>I received over 111 handwritten letters
from different people in one week.</i>

09:45.918 --> 09:49.214
<i>Penn State had all the resources
to make any dream come true.</i>

09:51.007 --> 09:54.719
But, you know,
things didn't go as well as we hoped.

09:55.303 --> 09:58.140
Obviously, that's why we're here,
where we are today.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.396
[Williams] It's about what it's gonna take

10:04.479 --> 10:06.606
to get the job done
and come home with a victory.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.442
And that's handling
our responsibility up front.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.028
Man, it seemed like...

10:12.112 --> 10:15.240
when that damn vent came on, boy,
I'm smelling corn chips, man. Y'all got...

10:15.323 --> 10:17.468
- [player 1] Kam.
- [player 2] Boy! That thing there...

10:17.492 --> 10:18.618
[laughing]

10:18.701 --> 10:20.453
That thing right there is funky.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.664
[Williams] Cuz, put your damn shoes
back on, man.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.541
[players laughing]

10:24.624 --> 10:27.502
You need to put some baking soda
on your socks.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.547
At least keep your feet in your shoes.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.508
Don't throw that at nobody.
That's selfish, man.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.926
[all laughing]

10:35.718 --> 10:38.930
[Williams] No selfish plays.
No second-guessing.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.474
Let's go out there and execute,
and we'll be fine.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.059
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

10:44.101 --> 10:45.520
[Milner] <i>This week is Itawamba.</i>

10:45.603 --> 10:49.316
If you consider rivalry games,
this right here is your rivalry game.

10:49.941 --> 10:54.571
<i>In 2012, they ended our potential
national championship run</i>

10:54.654 --> 10:57.157
<i>by beating us on a field goal
at the end of the game.</i>

10:57.574 --> 10:58.741
<i>This time, they're ranked.</i>

10:58.825 --> 11:01.203
I think they've got more talent
than they have had in years.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.205
It should make for a huge match-up.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.456
[indistinct chatter]

11:04.539 --> 11:06.874
[Ed Holly] <i>It is their Super Bowl,</i>
<i>understand this.</i>

11:06.958 --> 11:09.836
They're gonna come out.
They're gonna give you their best shot.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.963
We not only have to take it,
we gotta give it back.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.966
Our offense is on fire.
We got the best offense in the country.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.260
Can we hold up as a defense?
And I say yes.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.470
Here we go. Grab a line.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.033
[Pellegrin] <i>We moved up to number 11.</i>

11:20.096 --> 11:22.390
<i>The rankings are not foolproof.</i>

11:22.474 --> 11:24.601
<i>You have human voters
prone to make mistakes.</i>

11:24.684 --> 11:28.646
They're prone to rank someone's victories
higher than the other, they're prone to...

11:29.397 --> 11:30.749
Sometimes, they're prone to spite.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.485
<i>And that's why it's so important to...</i>

11:33.568 --> 11:36.070
<i>like Coach Stephens has said,
just leave no doubts.</i>

11:36.153 --> 11:38.531
We lost to Jones,
but we still control our own destiny.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.157
If we win the state with one loss...

11:41.117 --> 11:42.636
I don't think there is any way
they can keep us out

11:42.660 --> 11:44.246
of the national championship.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.375
[Wood] Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.961
[Buddy] Jeez. Jeez. Jeez.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.397
[Wood] Can't get out of here
the day before

11:53.421 --> 11:55.316
and bust on a play
we're counting on being able to run.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.384
- Can't do it. Can't do it.
- [Buddy] Jeez.

11:58.050 --> 12:01.220
Jeez. Come on, guys.
Pick it up. Let's go.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.682
[Crowder] <i>De'Andre Johnson,</i>
<i>so far this season...</i>

12:05.392 --> 12:08.686
hasn't run the offense as cleanly
as you would expect.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.274
<i>Is it too high of expectations on him?</i>

12:12.357 --> 12:14.084
[Crowder over radio] <i>Johnson fires</i>
<i>down left sideline.</i>

12:14.108 --> 12:15.378
<i>Intercepted at the 19-yard line...</i>

12:15.402 --> 12:19.030
Is he good enough? Is he as talented
as we thought he was, or is he just rusty?

12:19.113 --> 12:22.534
[Buddy] <i>I didn't see De'Andre</i>
<i>taking charge.</i>

12:22.617 --> 12:25.202
<i>I didn't see him stepping into his passes.</i>

12:25.287 --> 12:27.455
You know, just being that leader

12:27.539 --> 12:29.707
of making sure
everybody's on the same page.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.501
Um, and he...

12:31.584 --> 12:33.044
You know, he'll get better at that.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.506
Again, you know, it's been two years
since he's taken snaps.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.677
<i>You know, the guy taking the snaps for us,
he's the guy that runs the show.</i>

12:41.386 --> 12:42.637
[De'Andre grunts]

12:42.720 --> 12:45.223
[Trickett] <i>It was your second game,</i>
<i>so that is gonna happen,</i>

12:45.306 --> 12:47.934
but we wanna keep cutting down
on the miscommunication stuff.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.187
Shit like that happens.
Good players gonna make good plays.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.855
[De'Andre] <i>I was nervous.</i>

12:52.939 --> 12:54.566
<i>That was kind of a bad start for me.</i>

12:54.649 --> 12:57.234
Throw an interception. I'm like... [sighs]

12:57.319 --> 13:00.322
"This the comeback, huh?
I can't come back like this.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.739
I gotta come back stronger."

13:01.823 --> 13:05.034
[Buddy] You gotta look outside.
Look outside. Make the man call.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.661
- Make the man call. No!
- Fuck!

13:06.744 --> 13:09.747
Outside! Look outside! There's 27!

13:09.831 --> 13:11.123
Make the man call!

13:11.833 --> 13:14.293
All right. No. No, no.
Gosh almighty, Tim.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.255
I gotta get another job.
I gotta do something else.

13:19.006 --> 13:22.093
With young people today,
in today's society,

13:22.176 --> 13:24.053
I think you have to be...

13:24.136 --> 13:25.722
You have to be ultra-direct,

13:25.805 --> 13:29.016
because they don't get it
in a lot of places.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.018
<i>They don't get direct talk.</i>

13:31.102 --> 13:33.229
- Run! No, come back.
- [whistle blows]

13:33.312 --> 13:36.399
Get north and south! North and south!

13:36.483 --> 13:38.067
Don't do this. Do it!

13:38.150 --> 13:40.528
<i>If you constantly praise 'em,</i>

13:40.612 --> 13:43.448
<i>they relax a little bit,
and I don't want 'em to relax.</i>

13:43.531 --> 13:47.201
I want 'em to keep constantly striving
to be better,

13:47.284 --> 13:49.662
and I don't want 'em to be complacent.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.331
I don't want 'em to get complacent
in any part of their life.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.125
All right? There ain't no get-up!

13:54.709 --> 13:57.045
This ain't high school! Ain't no get-up!

13:57.545 --> 13:59.171
Get down and let's go, run!

14:00.590 --> 14:02.884
- [whistle blows]
- Get out. Get out. Get out.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.262
Go over yonder and sit in the dadgum shade
the rest of the day.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.931
Sit in the shade the rest of the day.
I ain't putting up with it.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.559
Go! Walter, you're starting
at left guard this week.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.686
Get your rear end over yonder.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.399
Horsecrap! Did you go to treatment
this morning at 6:45?

14:17.482 --> 14:19.275
No! You didn't!

14:19.651 --> 14:20.652
I'm sick of it!

14:22.153 --> 14:23.613
Quit if you want to!

14:24.406 --> 14:26.046
Gleaton, whining and crying
about his knee

14:26.115 --> 14:28.910
[stutters] and he didn't go to...
Didn't even go to treatment today.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.203
Hurry up!

14:31.996 --> 14:33.956
Hey, y'all handle that stuff and keep him

14:34.040 --> 14:35.721
from getting
one of my quarterbacks killed.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.002
Now, I don't trust he ain't gonna get
a quarterback hurt.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.881
Missed treatment this morning,
and then come out doing this stuff.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.364
I promise you, four of y'all together,
ain't gonna get the...

14:44.426 --> 14:45.802
Ain't gonna get your butt whooped.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.514
[exhales]

14:52.517 --> 14:54.143
[Zeke] I don't like this boot, bro.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.978
You know they ain't gonna let me play.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.262
[Kam] I was telling them, son,

14:57.313 --> 15:00.483
"I'm not gonna sit out in D-I
if I sprain my fucking ankle."

15:00.567 --> 15:03.861
[Zeke] I ain't never been D-I, so shit.
I don't know what go on.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.321
[Kam] Ask my nigga Chauncey.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.699
Hey, son, you sprain your ankle in D-I,
what'd they do?

15:08.366 --> 15:10.447
Tell you to get right back
on the fucking field, son.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.037
If you sit out,
you gonna be out for a while.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.706
And you gonna lose your spot.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.436
"Can't make the club in the tub,"
that's what they tell you.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.712
- [Zeke] Can't what?
- "Can't make the club in the tub."

15:20.795 --> 15:21.879
[whistle blows]

15:21.963 --> 15:24.243
- [De'Andre] You playing this week?
- [Isaiah] I'm hoping.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.635
I feel good.
On the real, I feel good.

15:27.719 --> 15:28.720
Mm-hmm.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.513
It's gonna be a great week.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.434
[Isaiah] That man told me,
"We really gonna need you Thursday."

15:34.517 --> 15:36.060
- Yeah?
- I told him, "I got you, look,

15:36.143 --> 15:37.904
'cause I've been
really pissed the fuck out."

15:37.979 --> 15:39.021
Right.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.232
I only did three fucking plays.

15:41.315 --> 15:45.152
For me to feel good about myself,
I have to be out on the field.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.279
I've never sat on the bench.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.365
Like, once you take sports from us...

15:50.617 --> 15:52.243
we don't know anything else.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.286
Like, I can tell you, high school,

15:54.370 --> 15:57.206
football season was over with,
I stopped going to school.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.710
I mean, I just... I...

16:00.793 --> 16:03.796
That's the only way I got
through school, was football.

16:05.339 --> 16:08.885
I really need to do that, uh, what's that,
uh, one math I need to do?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.513
- [Jazlyn] What math?
- Finite math? I gotta do that.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.640
[Jazlyn] You said
we were gonna do that in January.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.807
[Isaiah] I know.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.144
I'm gonna take the class in January.
We'll take the class together.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.062
[stuttering] Bae...

16:20.146 --> 16:22.231
- No.
- No?

16:22.314 --> 16:23.751
- Why you say...
- You're gonna do the work.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.902
- Huh?
- And you're gonna pay attention.

16:25.985 --> 16:31.032
And you're not going to go daze off
into whatever zone you go into.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.118
I don't be in no zones in class,
I pay attention.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.804
- I pay attention in class.
- You pay attention?

16:35.828 --> 16:38.998
Duh, I pay attention in class.
I'm about to go to class early.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.003
- You about to go to class?
- Isaiah about to go to class early...

16:44.086 --> 16:46.422
Go ahead. Go to class,
you gonna be sitting in there,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.506
- the only person in there.
- Just sitting there...

16:48.550 --> 16:50.301
[Isaiah] <i>I got me a fiancée.</i>

16:51.260 --> 16:53.805
Keep my head right in them books.
[chuckles]

16:54.471 --> 16:55.807
I need help off the field,

16:55.890 --> 16:58.267
she gonna be there with me,
no matter what, off the field.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.688
<i>So anything I do,
she there with me to support me.</i>

17:01.771 --> 17:03.105
<i>And that's what I love about her.</i>

17:03.189 --> 17:04.833
[Jazlyn] <i>"You're going with me."</i>
<i>That's what he told me.</i>

17:04.857 --> 17:07.527
He's like, "You're going with me.
Wherever I go, you're going."

17:07.610 --> 17:10.572
He said, "When I pack up."
He said, "You're gonna pack up,

17:10.655 --> 17:11.906
and we're gonna go."

17:11.989 --> 17:14.909
And he said,
"We're gonna start our own life."

17:16.118 --> 17:17.203
You miss me?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.121
[Isaiah] I miss you. I always miss you.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.886
[Jazlyn] Are you gonna text me this class?

17:20.957 --> 17:23.500
[Isaiah] Yeah, I...
Don't I always text you when I'm in class?

17:23.585 --> 17:25.712
[Jazlyn] <i>So he's happy.</i>
<i>He's, like, excited about it.</i>

17:25.795 --> 17:28.965
<i>That's all he talks about.
He's getting ready. Getting ready.</i>

17:29.048 --> 17:32.259
We have to get this done.
We gotta get our grades right.

17:32.343 --> 17:35.930
Gotta make sure there won't be...
That when it's the end of the semester,

17:36.013 --> 17:38.099
we can both leave with good grades...

17:38.766 --> 17:40.476
and no regrets.

17:41.102 --> 17:45.940
Make sure that he doesn't get hurt,
keeps himself healthy and go to the NFL.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.942
He say he wants to play pro football.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.743
[Isaiah] <i>At running back,</i>
<i>I'm getting hit every play.</i>

18:03.207 --> 18:06.210
Every time I'm doing something
on that field, I either get hit,

18:06.293 --> 18:08.838
I gotta block somebody, or I gotta do...

18:09.672 --> 18:11.883
certain thing to end up on the ground.

18:15.970 --> 18:19.849
<i>You don't feel it during the game
because your adrenaline is rushing.</i>

18:19.932 --> 18:21.726
<i>And then, I guess, after,
when you calm down</i>

18:21.809 --> 18:24.604
<i>and you wanna just lay asleep,</i>
<i>it all come at once.</i> [chuckles]

18:24.687 --> 18:27.106
<i>'Cause it's constant, like, it'll go away</i>

18:27.189 --> 18:28.775
<i>then five seconds later it'll come back</i>

18:28.858 --> 18:30.777
<i>in a different spot even harder.</i>

18:30.860 --> 18:32.153
<i>I just deal with it.</i>

18:32.236 --> 18:37.116
I don't like taking pain stuff,
I just deal with the pain.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.200
[chuckles]

18:41.037 --> 18:44.415
[Clark] <i>Well, football is a game</i>
<i>that is not played by choir boys.</i>

18:44.498 --> 18:45.833
<i>I promise you that.</i>

18:45.916 --> 18:50.254
As a matter of fact, in America today,
it's the last bastion of our society,

18:50.421 --> 18:55.217
where young men can hurl their bodies
into one another in non-lethal combat

18:55.301 --> 18:56.678
to test their manhood.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.055
It's a test of who you are.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.392
<i>I hear this talk all the time about,
you know,</i>

19:03.475 --> 19:07.063
<i>the rules now to protect the head injury
and all that. I agree with all that.</i>

19:07.146 --> 19:10.566
But if the football people
were to take the face mask off of helmets,

19:10.650 --> 19:11.651
two things would happen.

19:11.734 --> 19:15.279
You'd cut out all the head injuries
and neck injuries and that sort of stuff.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.615
And also, you'd find out
how tough some of these guys really are.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.701
[laughs]

19:43.975 --> 19:45.615
[Tim] I gotta put more
in my introduction.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.856
Well, if you know that,
why are you waiting on me to say that?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.899
'Cause I thought that was
good enough for it.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.444
- But why did you just say what you said?
- Because in the...

19:55.527 --> 19:57.654
Because you knew what I was gonna say.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.074
Read that to me.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.552
[Tim] "High school and college
both have differences," period.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.662
[Briggs] You said "differences,"
and you wrote "different."

20:06.455 --> 20:08.499
[Tim] Mmm.
So I gotta put an "s" on that?

20:08.582 --> 20:10.752
- [Briggs] You gotta put "c-e-s" on there.
- A "c-e-s."

20:10.835 --> 20:12.128
[typing]

20:13.170 --> 20:16.257
[Briggs] So, okay, what's the rule
with subject-verb agreement?

20:16.340 --> 20:19.635
If your subject has an "s,"
your verb doesn't.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.262
- [Tim mumbles] Doesn't.
- Okay.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.181
So, look right here.
And apply what I just said.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.268
[Tim] "A high school student
often depend on their parents."

20:27.351 --> 20:29.812
[Briggs] <i>A</i> student. One student.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.536
[Tim] Oh, yeah, I see what you're saying.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.690
- I see.
- [Briggs grunting]

20:33.775 --> 20:35.067
But I'm saying...

20:35.151 --> 20:37.904
It's your verb. No "s." "S."

20:38.905 --> 20:40.990
Not... Don't you put it on that noun.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.325
[Tim] Hold on.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.619
- [Briggs] "A student" means one.
- [Tim] Mmm, one.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.289
[Briggs] No "s," so I've gotta put
a "s" on the verb.

20:48.998 --> 20:52.668
[Tim] <i>Some people think college is gonna</i>
<i>be a walk in the park, but it ain't.</i>

20:53.169 --> 20:56.047
To be honest, school ain't really for me.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.883
<i>I get so confused,
I get nervous and I'm like,</i>

20:58.966 --> 21:01.761
<i>"Oh, man.
I ain't gonna be paying attention, man."</i>

21:01.844 --> 21:04.596
If it wasn't for football,
I wouldn't even be in college to be real.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.641
There's some stuff in there
that we still gotta work on.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.036
- [Tim] Mm-hmm.
- It's not perfect,

21:09.060 --> 21:11.395
but if we can get rid
of the subject-verb agreement,

21:11.478 --> 21:13.856
that's the difference
between passing and failing.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.650
[Tim] <i>Yeah, Miss Briggs,</i>
<i>she take out time for me.</i>

21:16.733 --> 21:20.737
I guess 'cause, like, I respect 'em
and I don't talk back to 'em. So...

21:20.822 --> 21:22.782
You show them respect,
they'll show you the same.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.951
And so, you need some help,
they'll help you.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.286
She would do... Take out time for me.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.789
That's one somebody
I can't forget when I leave here.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.369
[Wagner] <i>Tim, are you good?</i>

21:31.415 --> 21:33.310
[Tim] I'm always good, Miss Brittany,
you know that.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.294
[Wagner] Did you tell
Miss Briggs thank you?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.588
- Appreciate it, Miss Briggs.
- Any time, Tim.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.217
[Wagner] Bye, Tim.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.429
[Tim rapping indistinctly]

21:45.512 --> 21:46.680
Uh!

21:46.763 --> 21:48.474
[rapping continues]

21:48.557 --> 21:49.558
Uh!

21:49.641 --> 21:51.102
[indistinct chatter]

21:54.063 --> 21:55.606
- What's up?
- What's good?

21:56.273 --> 21:59.193
I'm gonna get you back, bro.
That was a sneaky little...

21:59.276 --> 22:00.486
Hey!

22:00.569 --> 22:02.363
Hey, what's up? Huh?

22:05.782 --> 22:06.783
[indistinct chatter]

22:07.784 --> 22:08.870
[laughing]

22:10.412 --> 22:11.580
[Tim] Get his ass!

22:13.040 --> 22:14.750
- Get his ass!
- [player] God damn.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.419
- [grunting]
- [laughing]

22:17.503 --> 22:18.629
Oh, oh, my shoulder.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.422
[all grunting]

22:22.925 --> 22:24.135
[indistinct chatter]

22:30.975 --> 22:32.851
Oh, there goes Miss Briggs.
I gotta go.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.315
Miss Briggs, you ain't seen nothin'.

22:38.399 --> 22:41.360
If you would put
that much energy into English...

22:41.443 --> 22:43.695
- I do.
- Go. Have a seat.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.898
[Wagner] <i>Why are you not in class?</i>

22:54.206 --> 22:56.000
- [Kam] I got kicked out.
- [Wagner] Why?

22:56.625 --> 22:58.252
It's, uh, for cussing.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.629
I was like,
"Sir, I don't feel like doing this shit."

23:00.712 --> 23:02.798
He was like,
"Uh, keep talking like that,

23:02.881 --> 23:05.217
I'm gonna file
a vulgar language report on you."

23:05.301 --> 23:10.222
- I'm like, "Sorry, what?" And...
- Kam, what is going on with you?

23:10.306 --> 23:13.100
- Nothing, I'm chilling.
- Kam, what's going on?

23:13.184 --> 23:14.544
I don't feel like doing this shit.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.146
Well, okay. Well... [chuckles]

23:17.229 --> 23:21.233
Do you just get to go through life
doing stuff when you feel like it?

23:21.608 --> 23:23.069
[Kam] That's how I live.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.780
And that's why you're here.
Because that's how you lived.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.951
Those were the decisions that you made.
You're here because of that.

23:30.034 --> 23:33.996
If I get my work done and all my...
all my shit's done, you know...

23:34.080 --> 23:36.498
Are you in your class right now
getting your work done?

23:36.582 --> 23:39.251
- No. Because you got kicked out.
- 'Cause he was bitchin'.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.088
- He's the teacher. He's allowed to bitch.
- [scoffs]

23:42.964 --> 23:44.881
See? And that's where the system fucks up.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.925
Okay. You're right.
It's the system's fault.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.303
It's everyone else's fault but yours.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.597
[laughs] Uh-oh, uh-oh.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.599
I believe y'all need to take
that camera there.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.310
[chuckles] He just need a haircut,
he can't think right.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.105
[player 1] They've been babying Kam
since he got here.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.814
A lot of players on our team get babied.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.625
- [player 1] True.
- [player 2] I'd get on his ass, too.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.692
- Kam!
- [Kam] What?

24:03.775 --> 24:05.255
[player 2] What your daddy do to you?

24:05.402 --> 24:06.737
[Kam] Fuck you mean, nigga?

24:07.446 --> 24:08.572
[player 2] What he do?

24:08.656 --> 24:11.241
- [Kam] Don't step in that shit.
- [player 1] What you gonna do?

24:11.325 --> 24:13.952
[Wagner] We're not fighting
in my office. Just leave him alone.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.954
They came and got Kam out of class, man.

24:16.038 --> 24:18.582
[Wagner] Brian, and it's not funny
and it's not good.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.501
- Man, he crazy! It is funny!
- [laughing]

24:20.584 --> 24:22.628
- [blows raspberry]
- [Brian] Teacher was like,

24:22.711 --> 24:25.214
"Don't use no vulgar language
in this class," or some shit.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.841
"I'm a grown-ass man!
I got three kids."

24:27.924 --> 24:29.987
- I told you he just said that!
- "I got three kids."

24:30.011 --> 24:31.262
- [shushes]
- "Who the...

24:31.345 --> 24:33.740
Who do you think you're talking to?"
Nigga geekin', he crazy.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.517
- [Wagner] It's not funny.
- Ain't nobody laughin' at it.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.435
[Wagner] Yeah, everybody
in here was laughing.

24:38.519 --> 24:41.605
Y'all all be laughing when your ass
is still in Scooba in May.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.773
[all laughing]

24:46.110 --> 24:48.404
I just gotta apologize. I'm good.

24:54.993 --> 24:55.993
[knock on door]

24:57.621 --> 24:58.872
Hey, Mr. Jenkins.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.459
My fault.
I didn't mean to be disrespectful.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.963
Hey, go out there.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.302
[Wagner] <i>I'm sympathetic to his issues</i>
<i>and, you know,</i>

25:11.385 --> 25:15.222
I'm assuming he's taking his medication
and, like, that all that is under control.

25:15.306 --> 25:18.267
And I'm sympathetic to that.
But it also doesn't give you a free pass.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.037
- It won't happen again.
- [speaks indistinctly]

25:20.061 --> 25:21.895
[Wagner]
<i>He's shooting himself in the foot.</i>

25:21.978 --> 25:23.706
<i>You get Player of the Week,
you have a hell of a game,</i>

25:23.730 --> 25:25.524
<i>and he does good on the field,
so he thinks</i>

25:25.607 --> 25:27.193
<i>he can quit at everything else?</i>

25:27.276 --> 25:29.070
Like, that kind of stuff, I just...

25:30.279 --> 25:32.614
[sighs deeply] I mean, I...

25:34.658 --> 25:36.702
It's in those moments
where I just wanna be like,

25:36.785 --> 25:39.621
"Okay, whatever. Like, just okay."
[chuckles]

25:43.125 --> 25:44.852
[Williams] I tell him
that's a rollable offense.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.253
- No, Davern.
- It is!

25:46.337 --> 25:47.713
It's a rollable offense.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.632
That's why I don't...
I'm not talking to you about this stuff.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.926
I don't need you getting on to him
and all that.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.137
- It's a rollable offense.
- [Wagner sighs]

25:55.929 --> 25:58.682
I need your support on that, Miss Wagner.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.894
You have my support when I turn him in
for something that I...

26:02.978 --> 26:04.980
It went, I mean, even, like,
right now, he's...

26:05.063 --> 26:06.607
We're working through it.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.401
[chuckles] See, if you roll him,
you won't have to work through it.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.112
He'll get it done.

26:11.195 --> 26:15.324
Miss Wagner said you went
and talked to that dude.

26:15.616 --> 26:16.658
- I did.
- How'd it go?

26:16.742 --> 26:18.577
- It was straight.
- What'd you say?

26:18.660 --> 26:20.621
I said it was my fault
for being disrespectful.

26:20.704 --> 26:21.913
It won't happen again.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.666
So you're gonna come out to practice today
with that same attitude?

26:24.750 --> 26:27.378
No. Uh, I've had a better day
since we talked.

26:27.461 --> 26:30.672
- Okay. Well, you might have a worser day.
- Why?

26:30.756 --> 26:32.549
- 'Cause you gotta roll.
- Why?

26:32.633 --> 26:34.551
'Cause everybody know
you cussed out a teacher.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.094
I can't do nothing about that.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.978
I can't just sit by
and do nothing about that.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.306
Can you just run me?

26:40.307 --> 26:43.185
- [player] Yay, tacos!
- Okay. I'll run you.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.029
- [Kam] All right.
- You ain't gonna like it.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.691
- I'll run.
- Why not roll? I wanna roll you.

26:49.775 --> 26:53.529
[sighs] I just hate it and it makes
my stomach hurt for the rest of the day.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.864
Well, that's why I do it,
'cause you don't like it.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.202
- [stutters] If I run you...
- But if I run, then we'll kill two stones.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.538
- You feel me?
- No, but I want you to pay for it.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.122
I really want you to pay for it.

27:05.499 --> 27:09.586
<i>I've coached guys with similar disorders
and similar problems,</i>

27:09.670 --> 27:13.215
in the past and have been
able to function fine.

27:13.299 --> 27:17.303
I just think Kam, within himself,
have to take responsibility

27:17.386 --> 27:21.765
and acknowledge what it is,
and try to do better with it.

27:21.848 --> 27:25.686
And that's the part I don't think he does.
I think he uses it as a crutch.

27:25.769 --> 27:29.147
I need you to understand what you did,
'cause what you did was wrong.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.607
Nah, I understand that.

27:30.691 --> 27:33.986
I can't let you off easy.
Your teammates know you acted crazy.

27:35.862 --> 27:39.074
Like I said, Coach,
I don't be having too many bad days.

27:40.201 --> 27:41.761
- It's once every...
- Keep it that way.

27:41.827 --> 27:45.497
- It's once every blue, blue moon.
- We're trying and keep it that way, Kam.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.999
[Wood] Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Don't wait on 'em.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.295
[Williams] Watch the damn ball!
Watch the ball!

27:51.378 --> 27:54.381
- [whistle blows]
- Come on, guy! Watch the damn ball!

27:54.465 --> 27:56.258
Jesus Christ.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.802
Hey, bro. How you doing?

27:59.553 --> 28:00.971
- How I'm doing?
- Yeah.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.849
Not real good, man. Not real good.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.101
[Vijay] <i>They said</i>
<i>I have a chance to start...</i>

28:06.184 --> 28:07.018
[inaudible]

28:07.102 --> 28:11.940
<i>but he's extremely talented.
Extremely talented.</i>

28:15.151 --> 28:16.570
It's just how things fold out.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.323
[player] <i>Vijay, the last two days,</i>
<i>we done got...</i>

28:19.406 --> 28:20.907
Scored. I scored about four times.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.869
[player] You are point dead lying,
what is wrong... Yo!

28:23.952 --> 28:25.430
- What up?
- [player] We can watch it on film.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.873
- Tell that lie to somebody else.
- We can go get it on film.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.583
Tell that lie to somebody else.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.961
I can't do nothing about it.
But I'm always ready.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.172
Always. There's not a time I'm not ready.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.138
- [Vijay] Ready, set!
- [whistle blows]

28:44.765 --> 28:47.017
[Buddy] Get off the field.
Defense, you're up.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.938
Hey, hey, hey,
get your ass beat this week.

28:52.022 --> 28:54.816
- [De'Andre] Let's go.
- [Buddy] Because you don't execute.

28:54.900 --> 28:59.112
Go ahead. Forgetting routes,
not knowing who to block.

28:59.195 --> 29:01.865
[De'Andre] Don't do that. Don't do that.
I fucked up, too.

29:01.948 --> 29:04.743
Get your helmet, Thad.
Camera watching you.

29:04.826 --> 29:08.038
Family watching you. Come on.
Get your helmet, Thad.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.956
[Ed Holly] Off the field! Off the field!

29:10.040 --> 29:11.583
I had an awful practice, man.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.460
Nah, see... Probably... Look, look, look.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.962
Probably physically, but mentally,
you were fucking sharp.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.675
You really surprised me when you was
calling down tackles and guards.

29:19.758 --> 29:20.759
You did good, man.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.788
- It's practice.
- [whistle blows]

29:23.429 --> 29:26.765
- Hey, Walter! Get the snap down!
- [De'Andre] Look, Walter did it.

29:26.848 --> 29:30.102
Something wrong with the ball.
Something wrong with the ball.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.689
One time, I threw a go-route
and shit came out wrong, too.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.275
Something wrong with them balls.
Leave it at that.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.986
[Ed Holly] Guys, this side runs,
they're getting six frickin' yards!

29:40.070 --> 29:44.074
That's awful! How do we not dominate
inside damn run?

29:44.157 --> 29:46.118
Get your head up and play football!

29:46.618 --> 29:49.746
- Do your job!
- [Williams] We gotta get lined up!

29:49.830 --> 29:52.416
Come on, Kam! Wake up, son! Damn!

29:52.999 --> 29:55.961
He the center, you've been playing
the G all damn day, right?

29:56.044 --> 29:58.004
- Oh, I thought I was over here.
- Tighten down.

29:59.089 --> 30:00.382
[panting]

30:01.132 --> 30:03.486
- I don't know what's wrong with me today.
- [whistle blows]

30:03.510 --> 30:04.970
[Buddy] Let's go, everybody, up!

30:05.053 --> 30:06.638
[panting]

30:06.722 --> 30:08.557
[Buddy] <i>I want to be...</i>
<i>I want to be, uh...</i>

30:09.141 --> 30:11.560
I wanna be positive, okay?

30:12.268 --> 30:17.691
I want to be positive and I'm gonna be,
but we're not executing offensively,

30:17.774 --> 30:20.402
and we're not executing everything
that we need to as a team.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.697
Does anybody out here think
that we had a great day today?

30:24.490 --> 30:27.576
If you do, let me know, okay?
It wasn't a great day.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.620
You got to focus, right?

30:31.162 --> 30:33.164
And I expect the quarterbacks...
Look at me, Vijay.

30:33.749 --> 30:37.377
I expect... Hey, I see a long face.
I see a long face. I don't know why.

30:37.461 --> 30:40.672
I need to see the face
that I saw about six weeks ago.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.925
Happy, enjoying things, okay?

30:44.009 --> 30:45.761
Some of you just going through
the motions.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.014
When you go through the motions,
you gonna get your rear end beat.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.558
You gonna get your rear end beat. Watch.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.897
I... You know... I don't know.

30:57.606 --> 31:01.443
You all have that stuff inside
that makes you want to be great.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.112
Some of you won't let yourself be it.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.534
And some of you ain't gonna
be around here in the spring...

31:09.200 --> 31:10.619
'cause I'm gonna get rid of you.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.247
If you don't do
what you're supposed to do,

31:14.330 --> 31:15.707
act how you're supposed to act...

31:16.625 --> 31:17.876
I'm gonna get rid of you.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.586
De'Andre, lead your team.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.212
[De'Andre] Whose Father?

31:21.296 --> 31:23.483
[all] Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

31:23.507 --> 31:25.133
[De'Andre] Lions on three,
champs on six!

31:25.216 --> 31:26.444
- One, two, three.
- [all] Lions!

31:26.468 --> 31:28.228
- [De'Andre] Four, five, six.
- [all] Champs!

31:28.303 --> 31:31.973
[Wood] I know, I know. I saw it.
I watched the same practice.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.818
- [Buddy] They're not concentrating.
- [Wood] It ain't the first time.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.977
[Buddy] Oh, I know.

31:36.061 --> 31:39.564
[Wood] I mean, we're gonna be okay,
we just got to get them to the gate.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.149
Just get them in the gate.

31:41.232 --> 31:45.153
We're gonna be all right.
But they were inconsistent at best.

31:45.236 --> 31:49.157
Good at times, really good.
And bad at times. Just inconsistent.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.921
[Williams] Hey, all y'all getting iced up.

31:50.992 --> 31:54.162
Coach Johnson, can you make sure they
get iced up while I take care of Kam?

31:54.245 --> 31:55.456
Come on, Kam.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.749
<i>You got from here to the goal line.</i>

31:59.668 --> 32:01.270
[Kam] Can you tell me
when to straighten out?

32:01.294 --> 32:02.921
[Williams] I will. Just roll.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.467
See, why you couldn't be that polite
with the teacher today?

32:07.383 --> 32:08.427
I don't get it.

32:10.471 --> 32:12.973
Hey, hey! You're getting
good at this, Kam. Come on.

32:13.056 --> 32:16.309
Soon, you may be immune to it,
then we got to start bear crawling.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.312
Or you just start doing right.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.482
Whichever comes first.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.066
Five more yards. Come on.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.277
Ho.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.322
Sit up.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.282
Coach, I'm so dizzy.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.659
I know it.

32:33.744 --> 32:35.245
I can't even open my eyes.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.371
[Williams] Hmm?

32:36.455 --> 32:38.289
I can't even open my eyes.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.293
[Williams] Come on, get your balance.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.254
Be respectful to everybody.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.423
Everybody's here trying to help you,
you got me?

32:48.341 --> 32:52.596
Okay, if you got an issue
with somebody, you come find me. Okay?

32:52.679 --> 32:54.973
If I can't solve it,
we'll take it up the food chain,

32:55.056 --> 32:58.184
but don't you try to handle
a situation yourself like that, all right?

32:58.268 --> 32:59.645
All right, Coach.

33:03.899 --> 33:04.899
[coughing]

33:05.942 --> 33:07.360
[coughing continues]

33:28.214 --> 33:29.925
[indistinct chatter]

33:33.595 --> 33:36.014
- [player 1] What?
- [player 2] Run that bitch to the ground!

33:36.097 --> 33:39.100
[all clamoring]

33:39.184 --> 33:42.896
- Got him!
- [all cheering and laughing]

33:42.979 --> 33:45.524
Yeah! Ice man!

33:46.567 --> 33:47.960
[Eszmone] I don't wanna hear your shit.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.402
[all laugh]

33:49.485 --> 33:51.905
[Wagner] <i>Isaiah's pretty</i>
<i>hell-bent on playing.</i>

33:51.988 --> 33:54.908
<i>I think the doctors did rule
that he had a concussion,</i>

33:54.991 --> 33:57.911
<i>but they're going off of, like,
what his symptoms are.</i>

33:57.994 --> 34:01.331
The guys say that he's not telling
the truth about his symptoms

34:01.414 --> 34:04.209
and saying that he's fine
so that they'll play him,

34:04.292 --> 34:06.044
but that he's really not.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.923
Man, Isaiah walked out of the cafeteria.
His car is that way.

34:10.006 --> 34:12.092
So he walk out the door,
he walking this way.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.528
I was like, "Where you going, Isaiah?"

34:13.552 --> 34:16.680
- "I don't know, man. I don't know."
- [all laugh]

34:16.763 --> 34:18.883
[Wagner] <i>I don't really know</i>
<i>that what he does tonight</i>

34:18.932 --> 34:21.810
<i>is gonna cause him
to gain an offer or lose an offer.</i>

34:21.893 --> 34:25.230
<i>I mean, I think, athletically,
he has proven himself.</i>

34:25.313 --> 34:30.401
To me, the only thing at this point
that is going to lose him offers

34:30.485 --> 34:33.446
is character issues or academics.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.073
[Isaiah] I walked to the locker room.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.242
Coach Trickett said,
"Bro, where you just come from?"

34:37.325 --> 34:38.744
- I said...
- [player] I don't know.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.328
"Bro, I don't even fucking know."

34:40.411 --> 34:42.080
[all laughing]

34:43.790 --> 34:46.334
And I just walked from my room.

34:46.417 --> 34:49.921
[Wagner] <i>I mean, I understand</i>
<i>that it's more than just a game to him.</i>

34:50.005 --> 34:52.382
But, you know, I mean, he's a kid,

34:52.465 --> 34:57.470
and I don't know that he fully understands
the scope of the situation

34:57.553 --> 35:01.266
that he's possibly putting himself in,
long-term.

35:02.558 --> 35:04.310
[cheering and laughing]

35:07.563 --> 35:09.107
[inaudible]

35:19.242 --> 35:21.244
[reverse indicator beeping]

35:29.461 --> 35:31.921
[Buddy] <i>There's only</i>
<i>one thing you can do, okay?</i>

35:32.422 --> 35:34.049
<i>There's only one thing you can do</i>

35:34.132 --> 35:36.760
<i>that's gonna make you
and everybody else in the world happy.</i>

35:36.843 --> 35:39.387
<i>And that's to go out
and win the game, okay?</i>

35:40.847 --> 35:46.561
You got to find it in here to be focused,
to be pissed off for 60 minutes

35:46.645 --> 35:48.855
and go play like heck, you understand?

35:48.939 --> 35:52.358
Go get after their ass, now, because
I'm telling you, they're gonna...

35:52.442 --> 35:54.903
[stuttering] It ain't gonna be
no easy game.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.698
But I promise you, if you go out there
and you lay it on 'em...

35:58.489 --> 36:01.785
it's gonna end their year.
You understand? In a bad way.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.888
- Is there an ass whoopin' in the air?
- [all] Yes, sir.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.973
- Is there an ass whoopin' in the air?
- [all] Yes, sir!

36:05.997 --> 36:07.058
- [De'Andre] <i>One, two, three!</i>
- [all] <i>Lions!</i>

36:07.082 --> 36:08.225
- [De'Andre] <i>Four, five, six!</i>
- [all] <i>Champs!</i>

36:08.249 --> 36:12.128
[Crowder] <i>Number 11, EMCC,</i>
<i>and number 15, ICC, here in Fulton.</i>

36:12.212 --> 36:14.356
[Winfield] <i>I hope everybody</i>
<i>that's left on our schedule</i>

36:14.380 --> 36:15.882
<i>is ranked in the top five,</i>

36:15.966 --> 36:17.318
<i>because that's how
you're going to advance,</i>

36:17.342 --> 36:19.678
<i>is to beat some of those guys
and to beat them bad.</i>

36:19.761 --> 36:21.361
[Crowder] <i>We're underway at Eaton Field.</i>

36:21.429 --> 36:23.974
<i>Coming out at quarterback is number 14,
De'Andre Johnson,</i>

36:24.057 --> 36:26.142
<i>your MACJC Offensive Player of the Week.</i>

36:26.226 --> 36:29.145
<i>And also Isaiah Wright,
who was injured in last week's ball game.</i>

36:29.229 --> 36:30.873
<i>The snap to Johnson,
they give it to Wright.</i>

36:30.897 --> 36:32.709
<i>Wright tries to go between the tackles,
breaks free.</i>

36:32.733 --> 36:35.151
<i>- He's gonna bounce to the outside.</i>
- [Williams] Come on!

36:35.235 --> 36:38.113
There you go! Keep going!
There you go, Four!

36:38.196 --> 36:39.530
Let's go, let's go!

36:39.614 --> 36:42.242
[Crowder] <i>First down. Ten to go.</i>
<i>EMCC inside the 15.</i>

36:42.325 --> 36:45.078
<i>Here's the snap. And they give it
up the middle to Isaiah Wright...</i>

36:45.161 --> 36:47.247
<i>inside the 5!
Fumbles the football into the end zone.</i>

36:47.330 --> 36:49.809
- [Wood] He fumbled the ball.
- [Crowder] <i>It's gonna be a touchback.</i>

36:49.833 --> 36:52.127
<i>And EMCC turns it over
on their opening drive.</i>

36:52.210 --> 36:53.795
[Kam] That nigga fumbles too much, son.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.088
[Wood] <i>Ah, that worries me.</i>

36:55.171 --> 36:57.590
[coach] <i>Come on, Isaiah! Get your butt up!</i>

36:57.673 --> 36:59.217
Let's go, Lions!

36:59.300 --> 37:01.344
[Beard] <i>He never had</i>
<i>a good handle on that football.</i>

37:01.427 --> 37:03.054
[Crowder] <i>Huge break for ICC, Glen.</i>

37:03.138 --> 37:05.056
[Buddy] Don't get your ass
blown up like that.

37:05.140 --> 37:09.310
Be a man and play! Be a man and play!
Get over here with your team!

37:09.394 --> 37:11.813
[Isaiah] I'm straight!
Damn, I'm good, I'm good!

37:11.897 --> 37:15.776
[Buddy] Don't sit on the ground and pout.
People look at that. Do you understand?

37:15.859 --> 37:16.919
- [Isaiah] Yes, sir.
- [Buddy] Next play!

37:16.943 --> 37:19.946
Listen to me! You stay in at running back.
Hey, really good drive.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.490
Just got to finish it, and we will.
Shake it off, next play.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.410
Look at me. It happens.
Shake it off, move to the next play.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.120
[woman] Let's go, defense!

37:27.203 --> 37:29.556
[Winfield] <i>Now, fortunately,</i>
<i>the best unit on this team now,</i>

37:29.580 --> 37:31.541
<i>that defensive front in the ball game.</i>

37:31.624 --> 37:35.128
<i>Tim Bonner, Kam Carter, a lot of guys
have stepped up and have made plays.</i>

37:35.211 --> 37:37.439
[Crowder] <i>Peyton Bender,</i>
<i>turns and hands it off for Thomas.</i>

37:37.463 --> 37:39.925
<i>Thomas busts it right up the middle.
Five... Touchdown.</i>

37:40.008 --> 37:42.218
[stadium announcer] <i>Touchdown, ICC!</i>

37:42.302 --> 37:44.595
- [Ed Holly] We're there, we gotta play!
- [Buddy] Jeez!

37:44.679 --> 37:46.157
[Ed Holly] We should be rolling
these guys.

37:46.181 --> 37:50.310
So what we got to do is settle down,
we got to stay in our scheme,

37:50.393 --> 37:53.897
do what we do and play Lion football.
We're fine.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.441
Ah, fuck! I missed that shit.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.693
[Crowder] <i>And here comes</i>
<i>the offense now and, Glen,</i>

37:58.777 --> 38:01.863
<i>the mood kind of seems to have changed
on that EMCC sideline,</i>

38:01.947 --> 38:03.281
<i>just observing the body language.</i>

38:03.364 --> 38:05.045
<i>Here's the snap.
They leave it with Wright.</i>

38:05.075 --> 38:07.410
<i>Wright goes up the middle
and he's gotten a first down</i>

38:07.493 --> 38:09.537
<i>as he dives forward
to about the 42-yard line.</i>

38:09.620 --> 38:11.289
[Isaiah] This shit fucking dead!

38:11.372 --> 38:14.459
[Crowder] <i>Great inside run</i>
<i>that time by Isaiah Wright.</i>

38:14.542 --> 38:16.962
<i>Inside hand off again,
and he is just busting free.</i>

38:17.045 --> 38:18.296
[Isaiah grunts]

38:18.379 --> 38:19.940
[Crowder] <i>Isaiah Wright like a pinball,</i>

38:19.965 --> 38:21.442
<i>is gonna bounce off
some would-be tacklers.</i>

38:21.466 --> 38:22.884
[Isaiah] That shit fucking dead!

38:22.968 --> 38:25.386
[Crowder] <i>Oh, what back-to-back runs</i>
<i>by Isaiah Wright.</i>

38:25.470 --> 38:28.157
[Winfield] <i>Isaiah Wright, running like</i>
<i>a guy who's mad that he fumbled,</i>

38:28.181 --> 38:30.225
<i>who wants to show
that he deserves more carries.</i>

38:30.308 --> 38:31.577
[Crowder] <i>Johnson's gonna give it</i>
<i>to Wright.</i>

38:31.601 --> 38:33.228
<i>Wright is gonna be tackled.</i>

38:33.311 --> 38:35.856
<i>He's gonna grab him by the waist
and ride him to the ground.</i>

38:35.939 --> 38:38.316
[Isaiah panting heavily]

38:38.399 --> 38:39.543
[Winfield] <i>He'll come out of the game.</i>

38:39.567 --> 38:43.029
[Isaiah] I got to throw up.
I got to throw up!

38:43.113 --> 38:44.590
- I got to throw up.
- [Bontrager] Why?

38:44.614 --> 38:45.698
[Isaiah] I don't know.

38:45.781 --> 38:47.492
[Bontrager] From the hit? Got a headache?

38:47.575 --> 38:49.702
- [Isaiah] Yeah.
- [Bontrager] All right, you're done.

38:49.785 --> 38:50.871
[Isaiah] Fuck!

38:50.954 --> 38:52.497
- Out?
- Yeah, it's not worth it.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.414
Okay.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.084
[Beard] <i>Guys, he hasn't seen the field</i>
<i>since the injury,</i>

38:56.167 --> 38:58.753
<i>and I think been ruled out
for the remainder of the ball game.</i>

38:58.837 --> 38:59.963
Double-Six, let's go!

39:00.046 --> 39:02.007
[Crowder] <i>So, Johnson at the 20 of ICC.</i>

39:02.090 --> 39:03.133
<i>They're in the red zone.</i>

39:03.216 --> 39:05.069
<i>Quick snap by Johnson,
gonna hand it to Horsley.</i>

39:05.093 --> 39:06.695
<i>Horsley goes right side, has real estate.</i>

39:06.719 --> 39:08.030
<i>Inside the 15. Stays on his feet,</i>

39:08.054 --> 39:09.907
<i>down the far sideline,
dives to the goal line...</i>

39:09.931 --> 39:12.433
<i>He's into the end zone. Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

39:12.517 --> 39:13.518
[cheering]

39:13.601 --> 39:15.561
[Wood] Way to go! Good job! Good job!

39:15.645 --> 39:19.107
- Let's go! Whoa! Let's go!
- [cheering]

39:19.190 --> 39:22.527
[Crowder] <i>We're tied at seven apiece</i>
<i>here in Fulton, Mississippi.</i>

39:22.610 --> 39:26.406
Isaiah's hurt. You're the punt guy.
You got 'em. Good drive. Good drive.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.491
- [Isaiah] Fuck!
- [Buddy] Hey, what's wrong?

39:28.574 --> 39:29.575
[Bontrager] Head.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.495
- [Buddy] Is he gonna be all right? Huh?
- [Bontrager] Not tonight.

39:32.578 --> 39:35.081
[stutters] Why?
He didn't get hit in the head.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.877
Isaiah didn't even get hit in the head.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.379
You can't run him three plays
like that in a row, though.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.964
I mean, running the ball like that.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.633
- Hey, when did you get hit? Again?
- Like, yeah...

39:45.716 --> 39:48.929
Yeah, 'cause they coming at me head-first,
so I can't do nothing else but go...

39:49.012 --> 39:50.513
I got to go down with 'em.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.599
No, you don't, but here's the deal.

39:53.683 --> 39:54.767
[stammering] If you...

39:54.850 --> 39:57.312
You're gonna end up not playing
the rest of the year,

39:57.395 --> 39:58.830
because you've got
to take care of yourself,

39:58.854 --> 40:00.731
number one,
you've got to get over it, first.

40:00.815 --> 40:04.402
You got to get over it first, okay?
Come on, now.

40:04.485 --> 40:08.364
Hey, get up there with your team.
Don't sit over here and sulk.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.909
Get over here with your team.
Hey, you understand?

40:10.992 --> 40:13.286
- [Isaiah] Yes, sir.
- [Buddy] Come on.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.805

40:16.122 --> 40:19.167
<i>Matthews hit in the backfield
and he is gonna be dropped, for...</i>

40:19.250 --> 40:20.835
<i>close to a loss, as the coaches here...</i>

40:20.919 --> 40:22.837
[Buddy] Get him out.
Get him out. Get him out.

40:22.921 --> 40:26.007
Get him out. Get him out. Kam!

40:26.091 --> 40:28.551
Hey, go down. Go down right now, Kam.
Go down.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.279
- What happened? Your shoulder?
- [Kam] My arm.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.472
[Buddy] Stay there
and quit acting like you're hurt.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.682
And stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

40:34.765 --> 40:35.976
[Kam grunts]

40:36.059 --> 40:37.727
[Buddy] You understand?

40:37.810 --> 40:39.645
- Stop it. Is it broke?
- [Kam] Nah!

40:39.729 --> 40:41.610
- [Buddy] Get your butt up.
- [Bontrager] Ready?

40:41.689 --> 40:43.417
- Ready to get to the sideline?
- [Kam] Yeah, I'm good.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.041
- [Buddy] Come on.
- [Bontrager] Come on.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.902
[Kam grunts] Oh, shit.

40:46.987 --> 40:49.739
[Buddy] You know, I hurt my knee one time.
The trainer stood over me

40:49.822 --> 40:53.743
and told me to shut the F up.
Quit hollering, yeah. Quit hollering.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.871
Want some Powerade? Try that one,
that's better. Want some Powerade?

40:57.663 --> 40:59.058
- [referee 1] Yeah.
- I'm bringing you Powerade.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.726
- [referee 2] Whoo!
- [referee 1] Here we go.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.668
See what a great person I am?
Come on, man,

41:02.752 --> 41:05.338
- I just gave you Powerade, dadgum!
- [laughs]

41:05.421 --> 41:06.672
Jeez, almighty.

41:06.756 --> 41:09.759
[Williams] Man, y'all play with some
energy out there, fellas! Let's go!

41:09.842 --> 41:11.261
[Crowder] <i>EMCC on top by seven.</i>

<i>Their defense trying to protect
the red zone to the left...</i>

41:13.638 --> 41:14.680
<i>The snap to Ellington.</i>

41:14.764 --> 41:16.557
- [Buddy] Ball!
<i>- And firing to the end zone,</i>

41:16.641 --> 41:19.185
<i>reaching up and catching it.
That's gonna be a touchdown.</i>

41:19.269 --> 41:20.270
[Buddy] Shit.

41:20.353 --> 41:22.164
[Williams] Our defense is killing us
every drive.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.732
[Buddy] God damn, guys. Come on, Chauncey!

41:24.815 --> 41:25.816
Good grief.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.070
Boy, hey, Chauncey.
Play! Make the dadgum tackle.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.947
Y'all are making it
way too damn easy for 'em.

41:32.032 --> 41:33.074
[player] Hey, let's go, D!

41:33.158 --> 41:35.743
Refuse to be blocked. Okay?

41:35.826 --> 41:38.954
Play harder and refuse to be blocked.

41:39.039 --> 41:41.041
Play harder and refuse to be blocked.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.709
Do you understand?
Hey. Get after 'em, okay?

41:43.793 --> 41:46.129
Get off the blocks,
don't let 'em stay on you,

41:46.212 --> 41:47.338
and just play hard.

41:47.422 --> 41:51.176
We just have to start making the plays.
Right now, we're just not making 'em.

41:52.968 --> 41:55.471
That's just how it is.
We got to make the plays.

41:55.555 --> 41:58.266
[Crowder] <i>2:56 to go,</i>
<i>and EMCC trying to break the tie.</i>

41:58.349 --> 41:59.392
<i>Johnson back to pass.</i>

41:59.475 --> 42:02.353
<i>Steps up as the pocket collapses,
and he is gonna be hit and dropped.</i>

42:02.437 --> 42:06.316

Come on. Dadgum!

[Buddy] Hey, hey! Come here!

42:11.696 --> 42:15.241
Don't you get on the field
and play that way ever again!

42:15.325 --> 42:19.120
You come off the ball!
Come off the ball! Play hard!

42:20.371 --> 42:21.531
[coach] Watch out, watch out.

42:21.581 --> 42:24.750
Look, the next damn time
we got a three-man rush,

42:24.834 --> 42:26.544
and we get a sack...
Get your ass in here!

42:26.627 --> 42:28.671
And we get a sack on a three-man rush,

42:28.754 --> 42:31.341
I'll pull your rear end out.
That's ridiculous!

42:31.424 --> 42:34.927
Both of you two were setting to him,
and he just ran right around you.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.433
You... Listen to me.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.018
Continue to play hard.

42:43.103 --> 42:44.871
[Crowder] <i>This has been</i>

[Winfield] <i>You have to think end zone.</i>

42:52.987 --> 42:54.405
[Wood] Be fast. Don't take a sack!

42:54.489 --> 42:55.823
[Buddy] Go for the end zone.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.284
[Crowder] <i>Johnson,</i>
<i>raises that left leg. Here's the snap.</i>

42:58.368 --> 43:00.408

43:06.084 --> 43:08.211

- Oh, no!
- Oh, no! You gotta be kidding me!

43:13.508 --> 43:15.236
[Crowder] <i>Are you kidding?</i>
<i>They're blowing the whistle</i>

43:15.260 --> 43:16.636

[Wood] No, sir. Field goal!

43:29.732 --> 43:32.152

43:35.363 --> 43:37.365
No, we're getting bullshit.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.909
Hey, that's horseshit right there.

43:39.992 --> 43:44.705
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no. No, no, no.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.957
That's horsecrap. It was a whole second.

43:47.041 --> 43:50.044
[Crowder] <i>Oh, you go...</i>
<i>Oh, my goodness gracious alive.</i>

43:50.128 --> 43:52.630
No, that's the biggest bunch
of horseshit I ever seen.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.465
- No, no, no, no.
- [Wood] That's bad, ref!

43:54.549 --> 43:57.177
Hey, hey, no, no, no. That's horseshit.

43:57.260 --> 44:01.181
Hey, hey. How can you do that?
How can you do that?

[coach] Ain't nothin' you can do.
They made that...

44:12.525 --> 44:13.651
[Buddy] Wait a little.

44:13.734 --> 44:16.321
Hey, hey, let me know what they're paying.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.507
[Crowder] <i>They'll take</i>
<i>a seven-point lead into the half.</i>

44:18.531 --> 44:21.909

don't worry about the drink!

44:24.162 --> 44:25.496
Get inside!

44:25.996 --> 44:29.792
Hey, shut up now.
Get out. Get out, right now.

44:29.875 --> 44:31.919
Okay? Or get back here. Hey.

44:32.002 --> 44:35.130
Get your ass back there, where you ain't
between me and a player.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.008

44:38.092 --> 44:40.261
Hey, listen to me.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.057
You are letting them stay around, okay?

44:45.140 --> 44:48.436
And some of you guys that do
all this yapping about how good you are,

44:48.519 --> 44:50.104
you ain't showed it yet.

44:50.187 --> 44:53.274
Some of you getting your rear end burned.
You getting your rear end blocked.

44:53.358 --> 44:56.026
Hey, at times, they're outplaying you.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.905
But you are good enough athletes
to overcome that.

44:59.989 --> 45:04.118
At some point, you've gotta say,
"I'm gonna put 'em away."

45:04.201 --> 45:08.080
All I expect you to do
is to go out and outplay them.

45:08.163 --> 45:10.250
Outplay them!

45:10.333 --> 45:14.044
Some of you guys that talk about
how good you are, outplay them!

fucking D-line in the country.

I ain't losing you for the year.

45:36.233 --> 45:39.695
Bro, don't tell me I can't play, man.
I'm about to get really pissed.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.781
Look, you can get pissed.

45:43.949 --> 45:46.369

- Bro, I'm fine.

I don't care. I wanna play football.

45:57.171 --> 45:58.774
[player] You rather play half a game
or a full game?

45:58.798 --> 46:01.258
I'll die playing this damn sport.
I don't care.

46:02.051 --> 46:03.052

46:03.135 --> 46:04.595
I would wanna play too. I feel you.

46:04.679 --> 46:06.306

46:06.389 --> 46:08.683
I mean, it's a slight-ass headache, bro.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.527
Everybody get hurt and they sit out.
Come on.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.687
- Man, I'm not sitting out, bro.
- [Kam] Come on, bro.

No, fuck that. Fuck that.

Still stay up, bro.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.070

46:21.153 --> 46:23.072
You the captain, dog.
So niggas look up to you.

46:23.155 --> 46:25.450

wanna see your ass do. Bitch.

46:25.533 --> 46:27.201
Don't bitch for these coaches, damn.

46:27.284 --> 46:29.662
Man, fuck all these coaches,
to be honest, dog.

46:29.745 --> 46:30.746

<i>He busts free,

48:05.466 --> 48:07.927
It's time to ball. None of this crap.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.095
Hey, Chauncey, right now,
this is our time.

48:10.179 --> 48:12.097
We own this time in history.

48:12.181 --> 48:15.100
We gotta stick the dagger
in their frickin' heart. Let's go!

48:15.184 --> 48:16.286
[Crowder] <i>Motion left to right,</i>

48:16.310 --> 48:18.789
<i>and now they're swinging it
out of the backfield and it is caught.</i>

48:18.813 --> 48:21.398
<i>Up across the 30, near sideline,
out across the 40-yard line,</i>

48:21.482 --> 48:22.567
<i>and he has some room.</i>

48:22.650 --> 48:25.277
<i>That's Matthews inside the 30,
middle of the field,</i>

48:25.360 --> 48:26.505
<i>- inside the 20, the 15.</i>
- No!

48:26.529 --> 48:29.114
<i>Ten, five. Touchdown, ICC.</i>

48:29.198 --> 48:31.200
<i>And that's just poor tackling
by EMCC there.</i>

48:31.283 --> 48:32.952
[Ed Holly] Make the freaking tackle.

48:33.035 --> 48:35.871
Make sure everybody knows
what the goddamn play is.

48:35.955 --> 48:37.808
- They gotta tighten up.
- [Ed Holly] God dang it!

48:37.832 --> 48:38.958
They gotta tighten up.

48:39.041 --> 48:42.712
[Buddy] <i>Ed! I can't keep doing this, Ed.</i>
<i>Come on, now.</i>

48:42.795 --> 48:45.475
- They're not 28 points good, guys. Okay?
- [Ed Holly] You're right.

48:45.506 --> 48:47.216
Bullshit, bro.

48:47.299 --> 48:51.303
That's just them wanting it more, bro.
That's just them wanting it more.

48:51.929 --> 48:55.224
[De'Andre] Hey, y'all, huddle up,
huddle up. We love games like this.

48:55.307 --> 48:58.352
It's time for us to put on
a fucking show. Let's go.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.312
This is where you see what you made of at.

49:00.395 --> 49:02.523
That's how you know
you're a championship team.

49:02.607 --> 49:03.774
Battling through adversity.

49:03.858 --> 49:06.026
Hey, I don't know about y'all,
but I love this shit.

49:06.652 --> 49:09.279
I love this. I love this game.

49:09.363 --> 49:10.781
I'm ready to put on a show.

49:11.866 --> 49:12.866
Whoo!

49:13.283 --> 49:14.344
[Crowder] <i>De'Andre Johnson,</i>

49:14.368 --> 49:16.829
<i>the transfer from Florida State,
out of Jacksonville, Florida.</i>

49:16.912 --> 49:18.682
<i>- Spot of the football at the 16.</i>
- [Buddy] Go!

49:18.706 --> 49:20.308
<i>It's gonna be Johnson running,
inside the 10,</i>

49:20.332 --> 49:22.185
<i>- inside the 5, towards the goal line!</i>
- [Buddy] Touchdown!

49:22.209 --> 49:23.418
[Crowder] <i>Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

49:23.503 --> 49:25.505
Yes! Yes!

49:25.588 --> 49:26.964
[Wood] Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

49:27.047 --> 49:29.800
[Crowder] <i>You can't rattle</i>
<i>De'Andre Johnson, guys.</i>

49:29.884 --> 49:30.926
<i>What a run by Johnson.</i>

49:31.010 --> 49:32.762
Great job. Great job. Great job.

49:32.845 --> 49:34.597
- Good job, baby.
- [Crowder] <i>It's 28 all.</i>

49:34.680 --> 49:36.181
<i>3:24 to go in the third quarter.</i>

49:36.265 --> 49:37.767
<i>Johnson looking left, fires it left,</i>

49:37.850 --> 49:39.495
<i>it's wide with a receiver cut
at the 40-yard line.</i>

49:39.519 --> 49:41.979
<i>Sidesteps a would-be tackler,
and he's off to the races.</i>

49:42.062 --> 49:43.731
<i>He's got one man to beat,
inside the 20,</i>

49:43.814 --> 49:45.525
<i>inside the 15, and he's gonna be tackled.</i>

49:45.608 --> 49:47.648
[Winfield] <i>Now, you gotta take advantage</i>
<i>right here.</i>

49:47.693 --> 49:50.070
[Crowder] <i>EMCC trying to break the tie.</i>

49:50.154 --> 49:53.365
<i>And firing it over the middle,
caught by Lanier. Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

49:53.448 --> 49:55.117
[Williams] Yes! Yes!

49:55.200 --> 49:58.245
[Buddy] Way to go, guys.
Atta way to go. Good job, baby.

49:58.328 --> 50:00.247
[players cheering]

50:00.330 --> 50:02.370
- [De'Andre] Great job, baby.
- [Wood] Give me some!

50:02.416 --> 50:04.376
[Winfield] <i>Just go right back</i>
<i>down the field</i>

50:04.459 --> 50:06.420
<i>and score and take that lead again,</i>

50:06.503 --> 50:09.757
<i>and that's a very big drive
led by Johnson right there.</i>

50:09.840 --> 50:14.469
These are the funnest games, man.
I love these games. I live for this.

50:14.554 --> 50:16.513
This is where you see
what you made of at, man.

50:16.597 --> 50:18.683
See if you're a champion,
or if you're a loser.

50:18.766 --> 50:21.226
[Williams] Hey, let's go, D. Let's go, D.

50:21.310 --> 50:23.187
We need more of that shit.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.330
[Crowder] <i>Here's the snap to Bender.</i>

50:24.354 --> 50:26.833
<i>Bender looking to throw it right side,
wide-open receiver at the 45.</i>

50:26.857 --> 50:29.057
<i>Caught down the far sideline,
and he's off to the races.</i>

50:29.109 --> 50:30.903
[Buddy] Oh, my God. He's wide open.

50:30.986 --> 50:32.196
[Crowder] <i>Ten, five...</i>

50:32.279 --> 50:34.323
<i>Oh, my goodness,
what just happened? Touchdown.</i>

50:34.406 --> 50:35.783
[De'Andre] Are you serious?

50:35.866 --> 50:37.201
Let's go do it again.

50:37.284 --> 50:38.953
Hey, let's go do it again.

50:39.036 --> 50:42.582
[Ed Holly] We're in Cover-freaking-Two!
We're in Cover-Two, Coach.

50:42.665 --> 50:45.084
We get it, we'll get it. Cover-Two!

50:45.167 --> 50:48.003
Guys, this is getting embarrassing now.
We're giving the game away.

50:48.087 --> 50:49.504
[Buddy] I thought Ed knew his shit.

50:49.589 --> 50:51.966
I think he's soft.
I don't think they work on tackling.

50:52.049 --> 50:53.801
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

50:53.884 --> 50:55.486
[Crowder] <i>Spot of the football</i>
<i>is the four-yard line.</i>

50:55.510 --> 50:57.512
<i>Johnson with a snap
and a quick slant, caught!</i>

50:57.597 --> 50:59.556
<i>Touchdown, EMCC!</i>

50:59.640 --> 51:02.685
- [De'Andre] Great job, boy.
- [Wood] Good job!

51:02.768 --> 51:05.187
[Winfield] <i>We have an offensive shootout</i>
<i>going on here.</i>

51:05.270 --> 51:08.148
[Crowder] <i>Firing it deep down</i>
<i>the field and caught in the end zone.</i>

51:08.232 --> 51:11.902
<i>Touchdown from 30 yards out. Goodness!</i>

51:11.986 --> 51:15.530
Hey, we fighting our ass off, man!
Let's tighten the fuck up, man!

51:16.198 --> 51:18.283
Fuck! Let's tighten up, man!

51:18.367 --> 51:20.911
[Buddy] Come on, let's go, Holly!
Let's go, Ed!

51:20.995 --> 51:22.037
Tighten up!

51:22.622 --> 51:25.249
[Crowder] <i>Here's a big third down</i>
<i>for EMCC.</i>

51:25.332 --> 51:29.336
<i>Lions are on top, 44-42,
with 48.4 seconds left.</i>

51:29.419 --> 51:30.713
<i>A first down ends it.</i>

51:30.796 --> 51:33.841
[Buddy] You got two downs, Marcus.
I don't think we can kick it from here.

51:33.924 --> 51:35.175
[Crowder] <i>Johnson receives it.</i>

51:35.259 --> 51:37.803
<i>Steps up in the pocket.
Now scrambles and can't bounce...</i>

51:37.887 --> 51:40.031
<i>No, he breaks a couple of tackles
and stays on his feet.</i>

51:40.055 --> 51:41.407
<i>- I don't know how he did.</i>
- [players grunting]

51:41.431 --> 51:44.852
<i>Down to the 35,
so that's gonna bring up a fourth down.</i>

51:44.935 --> 51:46.854
[Winfield] <i>Well,</i>
<i>Johnson's helmet came off,</i>

51:46.937 --> 51:50.399
<i>so if you were going for it, you're gonna
have to do it without Johnson.</i>

51:50.482 --> 51:51.651
[Wood] Vijay, let's go.

51:52.902 --> 51:54.820
[Beard] <i>Vijay in the game, guys.</i>

51:54.903 --> 51:56.864
[Crowder] <i>Vijay Miller</i>
<i>is gonna quarterback.</i>

51:58.240 --> 52:00.450
- [De'Andre] Fuck!
- [Buddy] Oh, dear Jesus, guys.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.369
I don't like it. I don't like it.

52:03.829 --> 52:06.331
- [man] Gotta have it. Gotta have it.
- Gotta have this.

52:07.667 --> 52:10.335
[De'Andre] <i>Fire the fuck off the ball.</i>

52:10.419 --> 52:12.880
[Crowder] <i>This fourth down and eight,</i>
<i>EMCC is gonna go for it.</i>

52:12.963 --> 52:14.631
[man] <i>This is the play of the game.</i>

52:14.715 --> 52:16.008
<i>This is the play of the game.</i>

52:17.176 --> 52:19.679
[Crowder] <i>Miller back to pass.</i>
<i>Has trouble. Rolls to his right.</i>

52:19.762 --> 52:23.515
[Buddy] Shit, shit, shit. Oh, God.

52:23.598 --> 52:25.976
<i>- Still rolling, squares, fires.</i>
- [Wood] <i>Make a play!</i>

52:26.060 --> 52:28.562
[Crowder] <i>Has a man... Caught!</i>
<i>And EMCC inside the 20.</i>

52:28.645 --> 52:29.521
[cheering]

52:29.604 --> 52:32.107
[Crowder] <i>First down, Lions!</i>

52:32.191 --> 52:36.779
<i>Oh, my goodness!
And EMCC just put the nail in the coffin.</i>

52:36.862 --> 52:37.902
[Wood] Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

52:37.947 --> 52:39.614
[De'Andre] Hell of a job, Three.

52:39.699 --> 52:42.242
[Winfield] <i>What a play by Miller,</i>
<i>the freshman.</i>

52:42.326 --> 52:43.535
[Crowder] <i>Play of the game.</i>

52:43.618 --> 52:45.454
- [Winfield] <i>That's a big throw.</i>
- Go, Lions!

52:45.537 --> 52:47.849
[Crowder] <i>We're gonna see</i>
<i>the old victory formation kneel down.</i>

52:47.873 --> 52:49.059
<i>- That'll run out the clock.</i>
- [whistle blows]

52:49.083 --> 52:50.292
[player 1] Baby, we good.

52:50.375 --> 52:52.938
- [player 2] We gonna do it.
- [player 1] We good. Keep on balling.

52:52.962 --> 52:55.297
[Crowder] <i>What a ball game.</i>
<i>This has been a good one,</i>

52:55.380 --> 52:58.133
<i>and EMCC now runs their record
to 3-1 on the season.</i>

52:58.217 --> 53:00.195
- [ICC coach] Hell of a game.
- [Buddy] That was a hell of a game.

53:00.219 --> 53:01.929
Good job, guys. Y'all played great.

53:02.012 --> 53:04.181
<i>Defense, hey,
tonight was our turn to pick you up.</i>

53:04.264 --> 53:06.225
<i>You've been picking us up,
it was our turn.</i>

53:06.308 --> 53:08.227
De'Andre, where you at? Andre?

53:08.310 --> 53:11.313
I don't give game balls,
but you did a hell of a job tonight, son.

53:11.396 --> 53:13.565
- Hey, hey, hey, great job.
- [players cheer]

53:13.648 --> 53:17.527
Tremendous fight, great heart.
Let's go back and let's get better.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.154
Let's get better starting tomorrow.

53:22.825 --> 53:24.869
[Isaiah] <i>I'm about to quit</i>
<i>this dumb shit, man.</i>

53:24.952 --> 53:27.788
[Wilkerson] <i>Isaiah. Isaiah, calm down.</i>

53:27.872 --> 53:29.352
- Nah, you guys took me out.
- No, no.

53:29.414 --> 53:31.583
Hey, listen. Listen, we won the game.

53:31.666 --> 53:34.795
Listen, calm down. We won the game.
We won the game, all right?

53:34.879 --> 53:37.422
- I don't really even care, bro.
- Yeah, you've gotta care.

53:37.506 --> 53:38.827
- I'm done.
- Don't get like this.

53:38.883 --> 53:41.426
Hey, look at me, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

53:41.510 --> 53:43.470
I know you're mad. I get it.

53:43.553 --> 53:45.597
But you can't act out.
You can't be disrespectful.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.975
- Learn to control yourself.
- Disrespectful with who?

53:48.058 --> 53:51.520
Me. Right now.
You're being disrespectful to me, okay?

53:51.603 --> 53:53.647
Just calm down. We won the game.

53:53.730 --> 53:55.491
Let's get well,
then we'll be back next week.

53:55.565 --> 53:57.734
I'm fine, I ain't no "get well"
when I'm fine.

53:57.818 --> 53:59.611
- You're not fine.
- Yes, I am.

53:59.694 --> 54:01.238
- You're not fine.
- Yes, I am!

54:01.321 --> 54:03.615
No, you aren't. You aren't.
Just calm down.

54:03.698 --> 54:04.784
Can I please go change?

54:04.867 --> 54:06.952
No, just calm down,
I want you to calm down.

54:07.036 --> 54:10.247
- I want you to calm down.
- I'm calm. Can I please go change, please?

54:12.082 --> 54:13.834
[De'Andre] Hey, you good, Zay.

54:14.835 --> 54:16.586
[indistinct chatter]

54:21.633 --> 54:23.427
[indistinct chatter continues]
