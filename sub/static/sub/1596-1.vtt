37:14.816 --> 37:16.526
THAT OR LET ME CUT OUT
A KIDNEY TO SELL.

37:16.526 --> 37:18.654
- WELL, THAT WAS
BEFORE I REALIZED

37:18.654 --> 37:20.572
THAT YOU WERE
A LITTLE PANSY QUITTER.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.116
AH!
- [speaking Spanish]

37:23.116 --> 37:26.454
- NOW THAT IS THE SPIRIT
THAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR,

37:26.454 --> 37:29.122
BUT LET'S CHANNEL IT
INTO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE,

37:29.122 --> 37:33.251
LIKE GETTING ME ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE RIO GRANDE.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.297
- HOW BAD DO YOU WANT

37:36.297 --> 37:38.256
- IT'S "BADLY,"

DRINK TOO MUCH BEER,
SMOKE A LOT OF WEED.

38:27.514 --> 38:28.932
- YEAH.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.726
WELL, THAT AIN'T GONNA WORK.

38:30.726 --> 38:34.397
YOU GOT TO PAD YOUR RESUME FOR
YOUR COLLEGE APPS THIS SUMMER.

38:34.397 --> 38:36.524
YOU'RE A POOR KID
FROM THE SOUTH SIDE.

38:36.524 --> 38:40.318
AND YOU GOT A 4.6,
AND THAT'S GREAT,

38:40.318 --> 38:43.530
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A FULL RIDE.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.282
WHAT'S SO GODDAMN FUNNY?

38:45.282 --> 38:47.784
- NO, IT'S JUST, UM...

38:47.784 --> 38:51.455
WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK
I'M GOING TO COLLEGE?

38:51.455 --> 38:52.581
- DUMMY,
YOU ARE GOING TO COLLEGE,

38:52.581 --> 38:54.291
AND YOU'RE GONNA GRADUATE.

38:54.291 --> 38:55.418

40:07.614 --> 40:08.990
- NO ONE'S GONNA BE
LOOKING AT YOUR HEAD.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.492
HOW MUCH DOES

40:10.492 --> 40:12.619
- NOTHING. TAKE OUT OF SHITLOAD

40:30.554 --> 40:31.930
CRAP.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.224
NEED A BUNCH

40:34.224 --> 40:36.142

40:43.567 --> 40:45.277

40:56.622 --> 40:58.164
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO GET YOUR GED

40:58.164 --> 40:59.541
TO SHAKE YOUR TITTIES
AND COLLECT TIPS FROM FRAT BOYS.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.167
- THE MONEY'S GOOD,

41:01.167 --> 41:02.586
AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE
PREREQUISITES.

41:02.586 --> 41:03.587

42:08.693 --> 42:11.112
- PATIO'S NOT OPEN
TILL MEMORIAL DAY,

42:11.112 --> 42:13.741
BUT IF YOU WANT TO PUSH
COCKTAILS IN 6-INCH HEELS,

42:13.741 --> 42:15.867
I CAN ALWAYS USE ANOTHER
PRETTY GIRL FOR THE SUMMER.

42:15.867 --> 42:19.162
- I WAS HOPING YOU'D GIVE ME
A SHOT AT ASSISTANT MANAGING

42:19.162 --> 42:20.705

SHAME ON YOU.

42:35.762 --> 42:38.723
FOOL ME TWICE--

42:38.723 --> 42:40.642
COME ON, GIVE ME ONE NIGHT

42:40.642 --> 42:43.478
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

42:45.981 --> 42:47.608
- GIVE ME A THOUSAND BUCKS.

42:47.608 --> 42:50.653
I'LL FIND YOU A NIGHT

43:02.080 --> 43:05.041
GIVE ME A CALL MID-MAY,

43:34.612 --> 43:36.197
- MIMOSA?
- UH, SURE.

43:38.199 --> 43:40.994
- YOU KNOW...

43:40.994 --> 43:44.080
A MAN HAS FEW THINGS
OF REAL VALUE IN THIS LIFE.

43:44.080 --> 43:48.710
HIS FAMILY, HIS FRIENDS.

43:48.710 --> 43:51.087
HIS ABILITY TO HONOR
HIS COMMITMENT,

43:51.087 --> 43:53.298
THE VALUE OF HIS WORD.

43:53.298 --> 43:56.342
EAT, PLEASE.

43:56.342 --> 43:59.554
I BELIEVE
THE ONLY TRUE MEASURE OF A MAN

43:59.554 --> 44:04.100
IS HIS WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTIONS.

44:04.100 --> 44:06.102
DON'T YOU AGREE?

44:06.102 --> 44:09.189

44:35.048 --> 44:37.550
- I KNEW THE GREAT LAKES
WERE BIG,

44:37.550 --> 44:39.886
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED
THEY WOULD BE THIS BIG.

44:39.886 --> 44:41.763
IT'S LIKE A SEA.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.728
SURPRISINGLY HEAVY FOR A MAN
WITH SO FEW BRAINS.

45:01.699 --> 45:04.702
[speaking Portuguese]

45:04.702 --> 45:07.956
SO, STEVE...

45:07.956 --> 45:11.960

OF HONORING YOUR COMMITMENTS?

45:14.462 --> 45:17.048
ARE YOU A MAN

- WHAT HAPPENED TO PEOPLE
PAYING YOU WHEN YOU DO THE WORK?

46:24.616 --> 46:26.618
- IT WAS JUST HER WAY
OF TELLING ME TO GO FUCK MYSELF.

46:26.618 --> 46:29.454
WHAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF
WAS HOW SHE JUST ASSUMED

46:29.454 --> 46:30.831
THAT I COULDN'T COME UP

46:30.831 --> 46:32.624
SMUG BITCH.
