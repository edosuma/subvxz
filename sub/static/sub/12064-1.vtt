See, if there's rioting going

That means the police are gonna
be stretched to their limits.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.588
- You should line up some big move.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.598
They'll just bring in more police
to sort it out.

16:09.719 --> 16:13.269
The police are the cause of this.
They shot a brother dead two days ago.

16:13.389 --> 16:17.110
That was no stop-and-search.
That was an execution. Trust me.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.069

Thank you.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.469

18:19.056 --> 18:21.479
I want you to look after me.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.448
You're gonna be a father.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.197
Just like you always wanted.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.873
And we're gonna be a family.

18:44.123 --> 18:48.344

The food's awful here,
but if you convert to Islam,

20:06.247 --> 20:09.342
besides finding the prophet
Mohammed, praise be upon him,

20:09.458 --> 20:13.304

brought in during Ramadan.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.219
- Are you a Muslim?
- Nah.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.218
But don't think about converting
unless you're willing to go pray.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.687
- Them brothers'll still fuck you up.
- Kill you for not praying?

20:21.804 --> 20:24.853
(Harry) Maybe not kill,
but they can handle themselves.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.521
Ever seen anyone get killed?

20:26.642 --> 20:30.363
Boys have taken their own life, but you
couldn't get away with killing anyone.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.698

20:33.983 --> 20:37.704
At least not in the wing, or in the gym,
or in the yard, or at canteen.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.700

Oi, book boy.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.249
- Faggot.
- Hey, uni boy!

25:02.084 --> 25:03.961
Uni boy.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.635
What, you can't hear me, no?

25:08.298 --> 25:11.347
Remember to come see me
tomorrow, yeah?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.472
Don't forget my canteen.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.491
(indistinct shouting)

26:08.609 --> 26:12.034
What's going on?
You all right, then?

26:12.154 --> 26:15.283
Come on, then. Where is it?

26:15.407 --> 26:16.909
Give it up.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.038
Just give him a little bit, man.
You know how strong that shit is.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.631
- Come to get high?
- Oh, yeah.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.928
- That's the proper thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:28.045 --> 26:31.094
- Oh, where's the music, man?
- Hold up, hold up.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.593
(I Music starts playing)

26:59.201 --> 27:00.498
Yeah!

27:07.876 --> 27:10.550
(Laughing and roaring)

27:25.686 --> 27:29.691
(Jake) Told you that shit
was strong, now, didn't I?

27:29.815 --> 27:33.490
- Home time now, boy!
- I ain't got no home.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.408
(Laughing)

27:41.326 --> 27:43.044
So...

27:44.454 --> 27:46.172
Jake.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.294
Er, you were arrested for
being carried by a motor vehicle

27:49.418 --> 27:53.139
taken without consent,
and resisting arrest.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.223
When's your trial?

27:57.885 --> 28:00.183
Jake, you understand that
if you're found guilty,

28:00.304 --> 28:02.682
It'll be a custodial sentence,

28:02.806 --> 28:06.481
which would be
your eighth sentence.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.782
Do you have any supportive family
who could help you at this time?

28:11.899 --> 28:14.243
- (Chuckles)
- None at all?

28:14.359 --> 28:16.657
Supportive?
I ain't got no fucking family!

28:16.778 --> 28:19.827
I ain't got no dad!
And I ain't got no mum!

28:19.948 --> 28:21.996
She never cared about me!

28:22.117 --> 28:24.791
She never cared when her boyfriend
used to torture me!

28:24.912 --> 28:27.335
Till I had to put a stop
to that myself!

28:28.624 --> 28:30.797
So, if you want to class that
as supportive,

28:30.918 --> 28:34.343
go ahead and write that down
on your little sheet of paper.

28:39.676 --> 28:44.307
- Jake, I'm just trying to help you.
- You're too kind, man.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.814
There are things that you could do.

28:48.936 --> 28:52.736
You could enrol on a training scheme,
a basic literacy programme.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.858
Like you said, I'm going jail, innit?

28:54.983 --> 28:59.659
But you have to make a change
to your life, put in some effort.

28:59.780 --> 29:03.284

And I'm fed up of this shit, you know.

- Night!

- Hello, princess.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.385
- Shut up.
- Where've you been? You're late.

29:21.510 --> 29:25.606
- You been busy with these dickheads.
- They're in process, you're on license!

29:25.722 --> 29:30.068
- Fuck the process!
- Fine! I'll just call the police, shall I?

29:30.185 --> 29:32.563
- I'll fucking kill you, man!
- Hey!

29:32.688 --> 29:36.033
You're on CCTV, dickhead!

29:36.149 --> 29:38.527
Oh, fucking hell, man!

Big man likes to smash up
a five-month pregnant woman.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.481
I don't need
to fucking prove that to you!

39:18.606 --> 39:22.611
- I don't need to hit bitches.
- You were all caught in a stolen car.

39:22.735 --> 39:24.658
Yeah. Yeah, I was in the car.

39:24.779 --> 39:27.783
I ain't denying that.
I didn't know it was stolen.

39:27.907 --> 39:31.502
Where did you hide the bikes?
Where's the fucking guns?

39:31.619 --> 39:34.714
She knew something.
That's why you tried to kill her.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.300
Keep talking about guns
and bikes and a robbery

39:37.417 --> 39:39.294
that I don't have
a fucking clue about.

39:39.419 --> 39:41.672
All I know,
you got me in a moody whip.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.426
Other than that,
go suck your mum.

39:46.342 --> 39:48.219
Well, you're going to prison.

39:48.344 --> 39:51.848
It got out of hand. You didn't expect
the shop owner to be there.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.646
You are a murderer!

39:53.766 --> 39:57.236
I was at home with my baby mother!
She can verify that!

39:57.353 --> 40:00.482
How do you explain
being in a stolen car

40:00.607 --> 40:03.577
one hour after the robbery
with your boys?

40:04.611 --> 40:08.366
They come pick me up, innit?
So we could get some ice cream.

40:09.616 --> 40:11.334
Innit?

40:11.451 --> 40:13.249
(Sucks cheeks)

40:13.369 --> 40:14.871
Right.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.967
You were seen hanging around
outside her office.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.715
- So what? It's my probation office.
- Look...

40:25.840 --> 40:28.263
You went back
to put her in her place.

40:28.384 --> 40:31.513
No, I fucking went back to apologise.
Are you dumb?

40:31.638 --> 40:33.982
Didn't have you down
as one for apologising.

40:34.098 --> 40:37.398
You know what? Have you even
got any fucking evidence?

40:37.518 --> 40:40.362
You'll do six months for affray.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.074
Six months?
Six months for affray?

40:43.191 --> 40:44.534
Fucking six...

40:44.651 --> 40:47.495
But I did it on the fucking
toilet seat, bruv!

40:47.612 --> 40:49.660

40:49.781 --> 40:52.204
Fucking prick, man.

It's all right.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.636
(Nurse) We need an IV right now!

41:49.757 --> 41:51.509
(Tommy) What's wrong?

41:52.093 --> 41:56.644
- Get off!
- (Nurse) Outside, please. Outside!

43:04.582 --> 43:07.005
Fucking come on!

43:19.847 --> 43:22.396
This is for life.

43:22.517 --> 43:24.940
Do you hear me, brother?

43:25.061 --> 43:27.029
Let's do this.

43:29.398 --> 43:31.071
Repeat after me.

43:31.192 --> 43:34.196
(Recites Qur'anic verses)

43:46.040 --> 43:51.843
<i>- Takbir!
- Allahu akbar!</i>

43:51.963 --> 43:54.261
You're now a Muslim.

43:57.260 --> 44:01.515
Brother,
your sins have been forgiven.

44:01.639 --> 44:06.941
This is a fresh start, a new book.
Embrace the brothers.

44:07.061 --> 44:08.779
Come.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.029
Part of the family now.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.717
<i>Salaam alaikum.
How are you, brother?</i>

44:29.834 --> 44:31.302
Yeah, all right.

44:31.419 --> 44:34.548
- What are you in here for?
- Assault.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.552
- In the riots?
- No, no, some other thing.

44:40.803 --> 44:46.310
Well, I find in a moment of anger
follows a thousand nights of sorrow.

44:46.434 --> 44:48.937
Yeah, that's more true
than you know.

44:50.521 --> 44:55.277
- Well, we're all sinners in here.
- Yeah, some more than others.

44:58.279 --> 45:02.375
The best of sinners are
the ones who repent, you know?

45:02.491 --> 45:05.165
And the door of repentance
is always open to you.

45:05.286 --> 45:08.381
This is my brother in Islam, Ali.

45:08.497 --> 45:12.047
This is my brother Mason,
who's just found the path.

45:12.168 --> 45:14.967
What, you're a Muslim, yeah?

45:15.087 --> 45:17.010
<i>Hamdu lillah.</i>

45:17.131 --> 45:21.011
You're here to repent your sins, is it?

45:21.135 --> 45:24.480
- A man's sins are his own business.
- Is that a fact?

45:31.145 --> 45:33.113
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

45:34.357 --> 45:36.860
Brother? Peace be upon you.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.160

<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

46:01.342 --> 46:04.221

46:55.187 --> 46:57.360

- You what?

46:57.481 --> 46:59.449
You fucking attacked
your probation officer!

46:59.567 --> 47:02.821
Fuck you, I only slapped her!

47:03.654 --> 47:05.873
- I'm gonna fucking take your life!
- I swear!

47:05.990 --> 47:10.666
I heard about her getting roughed up.
The feds already asked me about it.

47:10.786 --> 47:13.790
Why am I gonna attack
my own probation officer?

47:13.914 --> 47:15.461
That was my girl.

47:15.583 --> 47:18.553
Wait. Wait, wait. It was Jake.

47:18.669 --> 47:21.548
It was Jake.
They did the smash-and-grab.

47:21.672 --> 47:24.175
They did the smash-and-grab,
she was gonna tell the feds.

47:24.300 --> 47:26.974
Jake killed some guy.

47:27.094 --> 47:31.144
He's not gonna tell you about that.
He's only in here for car theft.

47:31.265 --> 47:34.269
I didn't have nothing to do with it.
I swear to you.

47:34.393 --> 47:37.146
I wouldn't have nothing
to do with that attack.

47:37.271 --> 47:39.273
(Voices outside)

48:18.229 --> 48:21.324
Elise, you're gonna have
to say something.

48:23.651 --> 48:26.530
Elise?

48:26.654 --> 48:28.656
- Please...
- Don't! Don't.

48:29.657 --> 48:31.159
Don't.

48:32.076 --> 48:33.794
Elise, please.

48:35.496 --> 48:37.999
Please just look at me.

48:42.086 --> 48:45.340
How can you want me
now I'm like this?

48:47.967 --> 48:49.844
I love you.

48:50.719 --> 48:52.847
Hey. I love you.

48:52.972 --> 48:55.691
I can't have children, Tommy!

48:58.686 --> 49:00.609
- All I want is you.
- That's not true.

49:00.729 --> 49:03.198
- Yeah, it is, Elise.
- It's not.

49:03.315 --> 49:05.409
All I want is you.

49:09.155 --> 49:12.409
You've given me
everything I want. Hey.

49:12.533 --> 49:14.080
(Sobs)

49:14.201 --> 49:16.829
You've given me everything I want.

49:23.544 --> 49:26.218
You should've been there, Tommy.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.389
(crying)

49:44.440 --> 49:48.286
I did it, bro. Had a little ask-about.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.279
So where are they?

49:50.404 --> 49:53.874
They were sent
to Gravesmere Young Offenders.

49:53.991 --> 49:56.665
So that at least narrows down
where they are right now.

49:56.785 --> 50:00.460
- For how long?
- Knowing them, it's gonna be long.

50:00.581 --> 50:04.552
- What's this about, bruv?
- Forget it, man.

50:06.170 --> 50:08.889
I've got to go, man.

50:15.179 --> 50:20.777
(Tommy) 'What's going on?'
(Elise) 'Everything we had has gone.'

50:22.603 --> 50:25.402
(Tommy) Please don't go.

50:28.442 --> 50:30.490
There's nothing left.

50:37.284 --> 50:39.286
Elise, wait.

50:41.413 --> 50:43.461
Elise, please...

50:44.458 --> 50:46.426
Elise, please!

50:59.515 --> 51:01.517
Fuck it! Fuck it!

51:01.642 --> 51:05.146
Fuck it!

51:05.271 --> 51:07.444

51:26.834 --> 51:31.431
You were asking who's Jake,
who's Mason, who's Essay.

51:31.547 --> 51:34.892
Well, I've just seen Essay
being carried out in a blood bag.

51:35.009 --> 51:38.980

in health care. Was that you?

51:41.223 --> 51:44.067
It was, wasn't it?

51:44.184 --> 51:46.778
What are you after?

51:46.895 --> 51:50.149

51:50.274 --> 51:53.244
So, you'll work your way

51:53.360 --> 51:55.533
Hey, yo, cuz. Come.

52:41.241 --> 52:44.211
Trying to show my man
some common manners.

52:44.328 --> 52:47.081
See this motherfucker's

52:47.206 --> 52:50.585
I never heard the boy say
please or thank you to no one.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.804
Man won't even hold door open

52:53.921 --> 52:56.800

Come sit down.

52:59.551 --> 53:02.600

Want some chocolate sprinkles?

53:02.721 --> 53:04.815
Why you asking if he want sprinkles?

53:04.932 --> 53:07.276
Who the fuck has sprinkles
on their coffee?

53:07.393 --> 53:09.987
Stop being a dimlo and
just make the fucking drinks, man.

53:10.104 --> 53:12.482
I fucking love chocolate sprinkles.

53:12.606 --> 53:14.984

53:28.580 --> 53:32.050
No, you done me a nice
little favour doing that there.

53:32.167 --> 53:34.511

53:49.059 --> 53:51.482

53:51.603 --> 53:55.528

You okay?

56:03.443 --> 56:06.743

in the gym, you had a weapon.

56:12.536 --> 56:15.039

56:15.163 --> 56:19.509

I work 60 hours a week in this place
and for fucking what?

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:13.247
People out there are looting the streets,
robbing off hard earners, hard grafters.

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:17.373
They're allowed to do whatever
they fucking want! But me? Not me!

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:20.671
Me? I'm out of fucking line,
aren't I?

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.262
Well, fuck you!

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:26.097
Fuck you!

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.845

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:40.062

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:45.363
<i>Get the fuck out!
Yallah! Yallah! Yallah!</i>

Are you happy now, yeah?
Where's my money?

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.223
- I haven't got any money.
- I know you have.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:19.817
Tell your mum and dad to transfer
the money to my account.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:22.403
Otherwise I'm gonna
fuck you up good!

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.943
- I haven't got any money!
- Tears ain't gonna help you now!

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:28.785
You were the one
smashing up the shops!

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:32.368
Cry, you little pussy!

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.792
What's good, red boy?

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.006
Want to be a hero, yeah?

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:50.678
What? Pussy turned badman, yeah?

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.669
Oh! Fuck! Fuck!

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:23.628
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.479

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:49.736

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.867
Come on, then!

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:01.328
Tommy...

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.404
Thank you.
He's dead, isn't he?

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.997
Yeah.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.082
You didn't have to do that.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.919
I wasn't doing it for you.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:48.383
She was gonna have a baby.
She knew about Jake.

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:52.379
I don't want to hear this!
I can't be part of this.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:02.768
I'm gonna kill them.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:07.609
Act natural.

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:14.524
Walk with me.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.375
(Low muttering)

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:35.470
I got to move quick.

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:38.808
Sooner or later, Jake'll find out it was
me in the showers with Angelface.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.599
You're sure he attacked her?

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.943
I'm sure.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:16.138

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.607

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.052
(Grunting and groaning)

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:07.806
(Gasping)

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:25.035
Don't fucking move, okay?

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:27.120
(Groans)

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:55.445
Red boy! So, you gonna tell me
what your beef is?

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.404
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:59.945
- Like you done Essay and Angelface?
- Yeah.

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:03.991
Had a feeling that was you.
Yeah, he was a good soldier.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:08.082
But fuck it, man. Labour's cheap
these days. So what's your problem?

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:10.452
I know you attacked
your probation officer.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.419
Mm, that's interesting.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:16.087
- Yeah, she was my girl.
- You done all right there, son?

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.209
She was pregnant. We lost our baby.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.587
I'm sorry to hear
about your little loss.

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:24.011
- But you're talking to the wrong man.
- No, I'm not, though.

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:28.557
Oh, fam, you're good, yeah?
So, what, you're sure, yeah?

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.431
You sure?
Yeah, I was on that move.

01:12:31.556 --> 01:12:35.481
But I didn't attack your bitch,
make you lose your little unborn.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.854
Best you go speak
to a Muslim brother down the wing.

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:39.481
What?

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:42.609
Mason. Yeah!
Mason's my boy.

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:45.862
I roll with him all the time,
and he rolled with us on that move.

01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:49.867
But the man's a live wire.
He attacked your bitch. Not me.

01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:53.165
- Best you go ask him yourself.
- No, you're fucking lying.

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:57.291
Lying, yeah? Back up before
you make a serious accusation.

01:12:57.415 --> 01:13:00.385
Huh? I told you Mason done it.

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:04.472
Running around in that eye paint
ain't gonna get you nowhere, boy.

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:06.307
Try come for me?

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:08.847
Think I ain't gonna
fuck you up, pussy?

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:12.222
I'll fuck you up sitting on the toilet,
with my hands behind my back,

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:14.849
scratching my balls with my nose.

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:18.854
I won't hesitate to fucking kill you,
you know, Tom.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:23.028
What can they do
to a man like me? Nothing!

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:26.403
I been in and out of this place
since I was crapping rusks!

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:30.157
But you? You ain't built
for no fucking place like this!

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:33.535
You ain't got it in you,
so it's best you just fucking chill!

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:37.038
You ain't got no drive,
just some misguided notion,

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:40.258
but you're too fucking lazy
to see it through.

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:43.548
See, I'm a warrior,
but I'm also a businessman.

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:46.673
See, we knew
you was up to something.

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:49.641
Don't take me
like I'm some corner dealer!

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.854
Me and my boy Jake here,
we're going into some business now.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:55.473
Yeah, like merging empires,
you know?

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.896
Despite what me and Jake's
been through in the past,

01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:00.736
the fact still remains
that Essay was my boy!

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:04.027
So, now it's time
to pay the fiddler!

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:12.122

(Muffled sounds)

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:31.388
What the fuck are you doing?

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:34.934
Don't fucking kill him,
we've got business to sort out!

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:39.730
For fuck's sake! Put him outside.
I'll put him in the block.

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:42.482
Get him in the corridor. Sparky!

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:46.565
Sparky!

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.299
(Door slams)

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:39.376
He)', get out!

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:43.047
Never heard me, pussies?
I said get out!

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.838
- I wanna to talk to my co-dee.
- Go on. It's cool, it's cool.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:47.926
Are you sure?

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:52.094
<i>- Salaam, brothers.
- Salaam alaikum. Come.</i>

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:55.343
Cuz, we got a big problem.

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:58.472
Tommy. Yeah, your friend.

01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:01.440
Did you know his girlfriend
was the probation officer?

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:02.979
His girlfriend?

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.194
That's why he's been
on a mad rampage,

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:08.190
running round,
got Essay then Angelface.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.533
Then he's come for me.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:13.243
Got the pussy laying half dead
down in the block now.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.862
What's this got to do with me?

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:17.206
Seeing as we're out of here
in a couple weeks,

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:21.203
you go see the probation officer
and finish this job off properly.

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:24.080
Remember we got a murder
on the out, you know?

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:27.459
So, you want another
on your hands?

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.052
- Are you serious?
- Man, I'm out.

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:31.921
I told you I'm done with that.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:34.469
Now you're sticking your arse
in the air five times a day,

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.013
that makes shit different
between me and you?

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:40.354
Let me make this clear,
you're with me.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:43.395
If you don't go see this
pretty little probation officer,

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:45.393
I'll have to see
your pretty little daughter

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:48.237
and make her feel
the grip of this beast.

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:54.244
So look into my fucking eyes and
understand what I just said to you.
