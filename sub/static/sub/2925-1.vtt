00:22.297 --> 00:25.429
You could argue even, you know,
Nick Drake's mystique is a lot

00:25.430 --> 00:27.588
to do with him not being around,
d'ya know what I mean?

00:27.612 --> 00:31.025
<i>If Nick Drake was now
on Chatty Man with Alan Carr,</i>

00:31.430 --> 00:33.095
talking about his new record,

00:33.096 --> 00:35.062
that mystique would
be dissipated, wouldn't it?

00:35.063 --> 00:36.861
No, you're absolutely right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36.885 --> 00:39.195
Age shall not wither him,
you know what I mean?

00:39.196 --> 00:42.262
- He's frozen at that moment.
- Ian Curtis.

00:42.263 --> 00:46.062
And it's a slender body of work,
Ian Curtis has got two albums.

00:46.063 --> 00:48.095
And of course, people who never
knew the band at the time,

00:48.096 --> 00:50.328
guys our age, "Blimey did you
ever see Joy Division?"

00:50.329 --> 00:52.194
I said, "Yeah, about 30 times,
they were always around,

00:52.195 --> 00:54.695
I was bored with them," but the
mystique builds inextricably.

00:54.696 --> 00:56.654
Starting to think that
both of us still being here

00:56.678 --> 00:58.795
is rather a kind of tired,
bourgeois thing to do.

00:58.796 --> 01:00.953
- What are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything, mate.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.961
Anyway, this is Findley
and Donovan

01:02.962 --> 01:06.094
and coming up later,
Wobbly Legged Rat, who,

01:06.095 --> 01:07.595
if you've been a regular
listener to this show,

01:07.596 --> 01:09.028
you'll know we're very keen on.

01:09.029 --> 01:10.594
Looking forward very much
to seeing them

01:10.595 --> 01:12.228
tomorrow, live in Glasgow.

01:12.229 --> 01:13.328
And later on in this show,

01:13.329 --> 01:16.228
we have Gabriel and Damascus.

trying that name out,

05:22.804 --> 05:24.562
so if you get any ideas,
just shout them out.

05:25.921 --> 05:28.554
All right!

05:28.555 --> 05:30.254
Come on, get started!

05:30.255 --> 05:31.421

is the bloody drums.

06:23.720 --> 06:24.853
Ow.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.419
Fight, fight, fight!

06:40.453 --> 06:41.452
Fight! Fight! Fight!

06:44.253 --> 06:46.552
You're a bloody
tea drinker, pal.

06:46.553 --> 06:48.419
You shouldn't be in a band!

06:58.352 --> 07:00.918
Are you okay?

07:03.252 --> 07:06.451
You're the guy from the fight.

07:06.452 --> 07:08.952
My guitar got it worse.

07:18.019 --> 07:19.685
You don't look so good.

07:45.118 --> 07:47.884
Morning.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.450
I was just gonna come
and check your pulse,

07:50.451 --> 07:51.570
see if you were still alive.

07:54.218 --> 07:55.916
Who are you again?

07:55.917 --> 08:00.050
Oh, James, the guitar player.

08:00.051 --> 08:02.529
So, do you have a job or do you
just make money playing guitar?

08:04.884 --> 08:07.516
No, I work at the university
swimming pool.

08:07.517 --> 08:11.250
- I'm a lifeguard.
- Lifeguard.

08:11.251 --> 08:14.150
I see, you're always
saving people.

08:14.151 --> 08:15.709
Grab the ring and just calmly
swim back.

08:18.350 --> 08:19.349
Here is the safeness.

08:21.784 --> 08:22.903
Yeah, when I get the chance.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.182
This is my stop coming up.

08:31.217 --> 08:33.383
So, thank you, lifeguard.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.582
I know where to find you.

08:57.883 --> 08:58.882
Eve?

08:58.883 --> 09:00.715
Eve, come back here!

09:00.716 --> 09:02.181
Eve, wait, hey, wait.

09:02.182 --> 09:04.248
Come, come, come here.

09:04.249 --> 09:05.967
Let's get her in
to one of the single rooms.

09:05.991 --> 09:07.282
I'm fine where I was.

09:07.283 --> 09:09.215
Well, you should've thought
about that before.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.015
So, we've had the police
looking for you.

09:12.016 --> 09:13.774
You've wasted our time
and the police's time.

09:16.383 --> 09:19.248
You've put yourself
right back where you started.

09:19.249 --> 09:20.807
So, you're gonna stay
in the single room

09:22.982 --> 09:24.748
that we've got for you.

09:24.749 --> 09:26.481
You'll have no visitors.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.914
We're gonna take your phone
and your books

09:28.915 --> 09:31.648
and you'll have a nurse
watching you at all times.

09:36.782 --> 09:37.781
Morning, Eve.

09:38.515 --> 09:40.381
Come on.

09:51.482 --> 09:52.880
Thank you.

09:52.881 --> 09:55.680
Step on for me.

09:58.714 --> 09:59.713
Okay.

10:11.148 --> 10:13.179
Okay, this is your life.

10:17.614 --> 10:20.713
People need to start
at the bottom

10:20.714 --> 10:22.647
and work their way up, okay?

10:22.648 --> 10:25.280
So, if you don't have
the basic things, like food,

10:25.281 --> 10:26.680
water, sleep,
you can't go anywhere.

10:29.147 --> 10:30.513
Only when you have those,

10:30.514 --> 10:32.446
you can proceed up
to the next level

10:32.447 --> 10:33.965
where you have a home,
family, friends,

10:36.713 --> 10:39.280
have money to get by.

10:39.281 --> 10:40.839
You have well-being,
relationships, sex.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.879
And then you could move up
to this top layer,

10:45.880 --> 10:51.013
where you have art,
morality, music.

10:54.046 --> 10:56.879
And these things can catch you
if you fall,

10:56.880 --> 11:00.579
but if you try going
for this top layer first

11:00.580 --> 11:02.746
and there's no support,
then the whole pyramid

11:02.747 --> 11:05.112
just crashes down.

11:05.113 --> 11:07.579
So, it's as simple as that,
is it?

11:07.580 --> 11:09.279
Yup, it is.

11:32.712 --> 11:34.278
Don't worry about it.

11:34.279 --> 11:36.237
Your stomach shrunk,
it's not used to a full meal.

11:38.846 --> 11:40.778
I've been crying all day.

11:40.779 --> 11:43.244
It's pathetic.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.444
It's maybe not such a bad thing.

11:45.445 --> 11:47.144
It's progress.

11:47.145 --> 11:50.278
Two weeks back, you wouldn't
have been able to,

11:50.279 --> 11:51.677
but now that you're
eating again,

11:51.678 --> 11:53.910
your body is waking up.

11:53.911 --> 11:56.410
You're feeling things again.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.343
That's good.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.023
And what if everything
I'm feeling is shit?

12:03.145 --> 12:05.377
That's the hard part.

12:05.378 --> 12:07.376
Do you ever think about
writing your feelings down?

12:15.077 --> 12:18.010
So, how are you liking it here?

12:18.011 --> 12:19.710
It's fine.

12:19.711 --> 12:21.909
It's not like I have anything
else important to do

12:21.910 --> 12:22.909
at the moment.

12:29.011 --> 12:30.277
But you will one day.

12:34.410 --> 12:38.143
All right, that's you're done.

that you felt good?

15:42.206 --> 15:45.038
I don't know, really, I mean,

15:45.039 --> 15:46.957
I guess everything sort of
started going downhill

15:49.972 --> 15:52.771
after I moved away
from home, you know?

15:52.772 --> 15:55.337
What did you love
when you were young?

15:55.338 --> 15:56.537
Um...

15:58.071 --> 16:01.771
I loved reading, I kind of loved
being by myself, I suppose.

16:04.971 --> 16:06.371
Um...

16:06.372 --> 16:09.504
Watching movies, dressing up.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.637
I know I have to eat,
I know how to eat.

16:23.638 --> 16:25.336
I know I wasn't
looking after myself,

16:25.337 --> 16:27.236
but I'll do okay.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.236
Why don't you try
for a music school?

16:46.237 --> 16:48.036
I could help you
with the applications.

16:48.037 --> 16:50.503
Well, I might do one day,
but right now,

16:50.504 --> 16:52.636
I just wanna get back to life.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.569
But your life before
you first came in here

16:54.570 --> 16:58.036
was a disaster, so it has to be
a different life.

16:58.037 --> 16:59.769
And I've got a plan
that involves

16:59.770 --> 17:02.103
a gradual reintroduction
to your life,

17:02.104 --> 17:04.182
combined with a step by step
reduction in your pills.

17:05.936 --> 17:07.175
And how long's that gonna take?

17:10.069 --> 17:13.068
Enjoying our time in Glasgow,
very much so.

17:13.069 --> 17:15.902
They "Kissing in the
Red Zone" hit makers,

17:15.903 --> 17:19.135
we can now say Wobbly Legged
Rats are gonna be coming in

17:19.136 --> 17:20.867
and doing a live session
later in the week,

17:20.868 --> 17:22.708
which people are looking
forward to enormously.

17:46.769 --> 17:48.434
Come on, fire up.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.368
We look frightened, we don't
need to be frightened of them

17:51.369 --> 17:54.067
because we're all fucking
mental, do you understand?

17:54.068 --> 17:55.967
They're not mental,
they don't have a clue, right?

17:55.968 --> 17:57.846
These are children...
they're beautiful children,

17:57.847 --> 17:59.726
but they're children,
and we can take them down,

17:59.750 --> 18:00.568
do you understand?

18:00.569 --> 18:02.101
Go mental!

18:08.168 --> 18:09.101
Come on, ref.

18:09.102 --> 18:11.567
Oh, right in the fanny.

18:11.568 --> 18:12.834
You all right?

18:17.468 --> 18:19.101
I'm gonna go and get changed.

18:27.868 --> 18:28.867
Eve?

18:29.568 --> 18:31.433
Eve?

18:45.867 --> 18:47.833
No, you're absolutely right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.532
I mean, do you think
that, like... I mean the Stones

18:49.533 --> 18:50.966
are still around, of course,
but, I mean,

18:50.967 --> 18:52.766
they do have a dead member.
I mean, obviously,

18:52.767 --> 18:55.085
there is a mystique 'cause they
did lose one along the way.

18:55.086 --> 18:56.852
It's almost like
with Led Zep, isn't it?

18:56.853 --> 18:59.299
It's almost like unless
you've lost one,

18:59.300 --> 19:01.033
you don't really kind of...

19:01.034 --> 19:03.151
You're not really the upper
echelons of rock 'n' roll.

19:04.967 --> 19:06.766
- The water looks really good.
- Jesus!

19:06.767 --> 19:09.766
You scared the shit out of me.

19:09.767 --> 19:12.065
Eve.

19:12.066 --> 19:14.132
At your service.

19:14.133 --> 19:17.032
I told you I'd find you.

19:17.033 --> 19:18.032
Wow, you look well.

19:22.666 --> 19:23.665
I like your knees.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.432
So, a swim, possibly?

19:30.699 --> 19:31.698
Oh, yeah, sure, okay.

19:35.332 --> 19:38.099
A quick one though, I have
to keep the main light off.

19:38.100 --> 19:40.932
Do you have a costume
I could borrow?

19:40.933 --> 19:42.211
Yeah, there's some
in the office.

19:42.235 --> 19:43.234
I'll just...

19:49.165 --> 19:51.131
So, what are you doing here?

19:51.132 --> 19:52.850
I was just playing football
against the uni.

19:56.199 --> 19:58.398
How's it goin' anyway?

19:58.399 --> 19:59.998
Really good, actually.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.677
Been making music,
writing songs and stuff.

21:02.330 --> 21:03.730
That's a big bag.

21:03.731 --> 21:07.162
Yeah, I'm kind of
in between places.

21:07.163 --> 21:09.696
Ah, well, you know,
there is a room in my flat...

21:13.564 --> 21:16.996
sort of a room,
a bit of a room that's free.

21:16.997 --> 21:18.363
- A bit of a room?
- Yeah.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.722
I mean, well,
it's a separate room,

21:19.746 --> 21:21.462
it's just a bit enclosed.

21:21.463 --> 21:22.895
Well, I'm okay
with enclosed spaces.

21:26.863 --> 21:29.062
Cool, well, I mean, if you want,
I can ask the guy.

21:30.763 --> 21:32.262
Okay.

21:33.529 --> 21:36.195
Okay, okay, good.

Sounds like the Pastels
and everything.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.525
I mean, that is absolutely
definitive indie,

23:13.526 --> 23:15.592
isn't it, really, I mean
the look with the sort of,

23:15.593 --> 23:18.325
you know, an anorak and hair
that looks slightly

23:18.326 --> 23:20.093
like it's been dipped
in chip fat, you know?

23:20.094 --> 23:22.012
I used to try and dress
like Roddy Frame in 1981.

23:24.893 --> 23:27.859
You didn't get a girlfriend
till you were 30, did you?

23:27.860 --> 23:30.626
Excuse me, hi.

23:30.627 --> 23:32.559
Are you guys doing
a live session tonight?

23:32.560 --> 23:33.879
- Yeah.
- What's your band called?

23:36.260 --> 23:38.525
Wobbly Legged Rats.

23:38.526 --> 23:39.645
Oh, yeah, I've heard of you.

23:42.759 --> 23:43.891
If I give you something,

23:43.892 --> 23:46.259
could you give it
to Findley or Donovan?

23:46.260 --> 23:47.618
- Sure.
- This is really important.

23:50.026 --> 23:51.758
They're expecting this tape.

23:51.759 --> 23:53.437
I'll give it to them
the second I see them.

23:55.193 --> 23:56.192
Okay.

23:56.659 --> 23:58.825
Did we meet before?

24:01.559 --> 24:03.025
Nope, never.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.558
I would have remembered.
I am Anton.

24:05.559 --> 24:08.925
We play at the Berlin Club
in a few days

24:08.926 --> 24:12.424
and I can add you to the list
if you'd like.

24:12.425 --> 24:14.824
Okay, sure,
I'll try and make it.

24:14.825 --> 24:16.224
All right.

24:16.225 --> 24:17.664
Just please give them
the tape, okay?

24:19.425 --> 24:20.663
Remember to give them the tape.

24:22.092 --> 24:24.657
- Yes.
- Thank you.

24:24.658 --> 24:26.391
Nice to meet you.

24:31.292 --> 24:33.757
She is unbelievable.

24:33.758 --> 24:36.857
Yup, but it's not like
she's gonna look at us

24:36.858 --> 24:38.757
with all the Swiss Germans here.

24:38.758 --> 24:41.076
No, there's no way she's getting
past the big Swiss German.

24:43.091 --> 24:45.457
Life is tragic.

24:45.458 --> 24:46.757
But good.

24:58.391 --> 24:59.390
Eve.

24:59.790 --> 25:02.457
I've been out
of the city for a while.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.495
Maybe you can tell me
if I start acting conspicuous.

25:08.124 --> 25:11.322
I like conspicuous.

25:11.323 --> 25:15.723
Probably take the freakiest
thing about you and blow it up.

25:21.323 --> 25:24.022
- Are your hands cold?
- No.

25:24.023 --> 25:27.222
I bet if I touched your hands
they'd be freezing cold.

25:27.223 --> 25:29.222
My hands are fine.

25:38.823 --> 25:41.122
Cold, knew it.

25:41.123 --> 25:44.622
I couldn't stand that, I mean,
I'd get sick instantly.

25:44.623 --> 25:47.555
I've got the constitution
of an abandoned rabbit.

25:50.723 --> 25:53.155
When did you learn to play?

25:53.156 --> 25:55.022

28:57.384 --> 28:58.383
Just you, just now.

29:00.051 --> 29:01.529
- You're very good at it.
- Thank you.

29:05.051 --> 29:07.416
I've been teaching this girl
to play guitar.

29:10.784 --> 29:13.850
Mm-hm.

29:13.851 --> 29:16.316
You should come with me
some time.

29:16.317 --> 29:17.983
And what do you want me to do?

29:17.984 --> 29:20.316
Maybe we could work
on one of your songs?

29:20.317 --> 29:22.183
Or you could help
her write something.

29:22.184 --> 29:24.682
I mean, she wants to write,
but she doesn't quite have

29:24.683 --> 29:26.350
your way.

29:26.351 --> 29:28.250
You may have to pretend
to be my assistant.

29:31.217 --> 29:32.855
- Carry your pencils and stuff?
- Exactly.

29:34.117 --> 29:36.474
Some thought should be put in
to the matter of what to wear.

29:40.516 --> 29:43.148
Hi, James.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.682
Cassie, this is Eve.

29:59.316 --> 30:02.415
Do you mind us
hijacking your lesson?

30:02.416 --> 30:05.282
It depends, are you going
to make me play scales?

30:07.116 --> 30:08.848
O.
- Then I don't mind.

30:12.149 --> 30:14.215
So, what would you rather do?

30:14.216 --> 30:16.881
Well, when I started this,
I was hoping

30:16.882 --> 30:19.281
we were going to write songs.

30:19.282 --> 30:21.381
It does help to know
your instrument first.

30:31.382 --> 30:33.300
I think sometimes
you just need to know the chord

30:33.324 --> 30:35.648
you're looking for.

30:35.649 --> 30:38.181
Yeah, but how do you find it?

30:38.182 --> 30:40.461
Well, maybe we should just
try and write a song right now.

30:42.115 --> 30:43.647
- Okay.
- Well...

30:43.648 --> 30:45.927
a good song isn't written
by committee, I don't know if...

30:45.951 --> 30:47.230
Cassie, what have
you done today?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.247
Just tell me the first thing
you did

30:51.271 --> 30:52.914
when you got out
of bed this morning.

30:52.915 --> 30:55.614
Well, I meant to get up
really early,

30:55.615 --> 30:58.347
but I was still the last nap
and I had to fill the dishwasher

30:58.348 --> 31:00.313
'cause I was last downstairs,
which was a rip-off

31:00.314 --> 31:02.647
'cause I didn't get
anything to eat.

31:02.648 --> 31:04.946
And then what happened?

31:04.947 --> 31:07.380
I jumped in the shower,
got dressed.

31:07.381 --> 31:09.946
Captain was crying
so I had to take her out.

31:09.947 --> 31:11.413
She's my dog.

31:11.414 --> 31:12.779
We went to the park,

31:12.780 --> 31:14.879
climbed the fence
for a shortcut.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.046
Anything happen in the park?

31:17.047 --> 31:20.113
Captain was acting strange,
she kept running ahead

31:20.114 --> 31:22.013
and then got into
the herb garden

31:22.014 --> 31:24.180
and then she started
digging like mad.

33:06.711 --> 33:09.210
My Theory for Applied Music
rocked.

33:09.211 --> 33:10.943
<i>We were doing Romeo and Juliet
 for English,</i>

33:10.944 --> 33:13.344
but I got more into the song,
"Romeo and Juliet."

33:13.345 --> 33:15.643
It's a good song.
The guy who wrote that song

33:15.644 --> 33:17.576
is a songwriting deity.

33:17.577 --> 33:19.543
Did he write any other
tunes as good?

33:19.544 --> 33:21.943
One, one and a half.

33:21.944 --> 33:24.776
So, then how can you proclaim
him a deus?

33:24.777 --> 33:27.610
A man needs only write
one genius song,

33:27.611 --> 33:30.610
one song that lives forever
in the hearts of the populous

33:30.611 --> 33:32.810
to make him forever divine.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.042
Well, it should be easy then.

33:35.043 --> 33:36.509
It's not easy.

33:36.510 --> 33:38.828
Many women and men have lived
empty, wasted lives in attics

33:40.744 --> 33:43.109
trying to write
classic pop songs.

33:43.110 --> 33:45.676
What they don't realize is
it's not for them to decide.

33:45.677 --> 33:48.875
It's God.
Or, the god of music.

33:48.876 --> 33:51.942
Or, the part of God that
concerns Himself with music.

33:51.943 --> 33:54.575
That's why the hit maker
has to be considered part divine

33:54.576 --> 33:56.055
because the divine
spoke through them.

33:59.210 --> 34:01.775
Preposterous notion.

34:01.776 --> 34:04.809
But quite a good one.

35:01.674 --> 35:03.074
Excuse me for one minute.

35:08.475 --> 35:10.807
- So, you came.
- Yeah, I just made it.

35:10.808 --> 35:12.940

35:14.908 --> 35:17.640

in a factory or what?

35:17.641 --> 35:20.007
No, I've been waitressing.

35:25.274 --> 35:28.373
What are you doing?

35:28.374 --> 35:30.506
I have an idea.

35:30.507 --> 35:32.673
Come, come.

35:35.574 --> 35:37.373
What is this place?

35:39.241 --> 35:43.073
This is where I work sometimes.

35:50.140 --> 35:53.273
Wow, do you own this place?

35:53.274 --> 35:55.591
No, I don't own it, but I know
where all the good stuff is.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.572
I could help you pick
something to wear.

36:00.573 --> 36:02.539
- Really?
- Sure, have a look around.

- Ah.

42:57.729 --> 43:00.228
Yeah, I hoped that they would.

not going to go for someone

43:03.629 --> 43:06.261

acoustic on an old tape.

43:06.262 --> 43:08.628

43:08.629 --> 43:09.947

43:09.971 --> 43:10.970

43:11.995 --> 43:13.194
Ow.

43:15.262 --> 43:16.900
You know, you need
to write for something,

43:19.162 --> 43:20.760
you need to have a reason.

43:20.761 --> 43:22.261
Right, be yourself.

43:22.262 --> 43:24.294
Write about yourself.

43:27.461 --> 43:31.160
Whatever it is
that's happened to you.

43:35.094 --> 43:38.227
I thought you said we were going

43:38.228 --> 43:39.427
Ah, we are just getting to it.

43:47.161 --> 43:49.093

43:51.961 --> 43:53.793
Wait, just put...
okay, put them on,

43:53.794 --> 43:55.759
thanks.

43:59.361 --> 44:01.793
Thank you.

44:07.161 --> 44:08.826
I want to be a councilor.

44:08.827 --> 44:10.693
Like a marriage counselor?

44:10.694 --> 44:14.159
No, on the City Council.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.559
How do you get that?

44:15.560 --> 44:17.359
People have to vote for you.

44:17.360 --> 44:20.159
Oh, no one's going
to vote for you, James.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.159
You're too feminine.

44:24.493 --> 44:27.426
I used to meet my friend Carol
before school,

44:27.427 --> 44:29.559
go to meet my boyfriend.

44:29.560 --> 44:30.592
What age?

44:30.593 --> 44:31.658
Thirteen.

44:31.659 --> 44:34.226
Quite advanced for 13.

44:34.227 --> 44:35.545
Good way to start
the day, though.

44:35.569 --> 44:38.458
Quick snog down at the statues.

44:42.292 --> 44:45.825
I like this time of night.

44:45.826 --> 44:47.758
Feels like the morning.

44:47.759 --> 44:49.558
I don't know why the birds
are going so crazy,

44:49.559 --> 44:50.758
they're meant to be in bed,

44:50.759 --> 44:53.091
or at least thinking
about sleep.

44:53.092 --> 44:56.024
They might get randy
at this time of year.

44:56.025 --> 44:57.658
Maybe they're
having a bird disco.

44:57.659 --> 44:59.625
Oh, no way, I know discos

44:59.626 --> 45:01.525
are frowned upon
in bird society.

45:01.526 --> 45:02.425
Oh really?

45:02.426 --> 45:03.358
How do you know that?

45:03.359 --> 45:04.478
I was a young ornithologist.

45:05.859 --> 45:07.491
Cass!

45:09.392 --> 45:10.391
Cassie!

45:18.525 --> 45:19.924
Cassie!

45:28.959 --> 45:30.357
What are you doing?

45:30.358 --> 45:31.724
We're going on a day trip,

45:31.725 --> 45:33.257
do you want to come?

45:33.258 --> 45:34.858
Go get dressed.

45:34.859 --> 45:36.390
Okay.

45:46.391 --> 45:48.057
Cassie, just come
out the front door.

45:51.325 --> 45:53.423
Oh, okay.

45:53.424 --> 45:54.723
What is this place?

45:54.724 --> 45:57.756
It belongs to the university.

46:05.924 --> 46:07.623
You're serious?

46:07.624 --> 46:09.323
We're going in that?

46:09.324 --> 46:10.890
How does it go?

46:10.891 --> 46:12.590
You have to paddle.

46:12.591 --> 46:13.889
Where are we going?

46:13.890 --> 46:15.523
That way.

46:15.524 --> 46:16.690
But what's that way?

46:16.691 --> 46:17.590
Are we going through the country

46:17.591 --> 46:18.690
or through the city?

46:18.691 --> 46:20.689
Are we canoeing through traffic?

46:20.690 --> 46:22.122
Well, you can either
go to Edinburgh

46:22.123 --> 46:24.323
or you can go to the sea.

46:24.324 --> 46:26.356
There's a fork up ahead.

46:26.357 --> 46:29.856
Anyway, it's kayaking,
it's not canoeing.

46:29.857 --> 46:32.056
We call this canoeing
where I grew up.

46:32.057 --> 46:33.335
Yes, well, we're
in Scotland now.

46:37.723 --> 46:40.555
Eve, why would you
want to come here

46:40.556 --> 46:42.755
when it's sunny in Australia?

46:42.756 --> 46:44.354
Well, because when
I finished high school

46:46.389 --> 46:47.789
I met this boy

46:47.790 --> 46:48.655
who was in a band

46:48.656 --> 46:51.121
and I...

46:51.122 --> 46:51.755
What?

46:51.756 --> 46:53.322
She's a groupie.

46:53.323 --> 46:54.855
Don't listen to James.

46:54.856 --> 46:56.488
Was he good looking?
Was he really good looking?

46:56.489 --> 46:57.388
He was quite good looking.

46:57.389 --> 46:58.288
Was he Australian?

46:58.289 --> 46:59.355
He was Australian,

46:59.356 --> 47:01.821
but he moved over here
with his band.

47:01.822 --> 47:04.088
I guess I followed him,
I don't know.

47:04.089 --> 47:06.322
Well, why were you
not in the band?

47:06.323 --> 47:08.155
Well, I wasn't really
playing music then.

47:08.156 --> 47:09.988
So you crossed multiple
continents for a boy.

47:13.322 --> 47:15.654
This is weird.

47:15.655 --> 47:16.754
You want to go back?

47:16.755 --> 47:18.688
No, it's good weird.

47:18.689 --> 47:20.588
I feel like I'm escaping.

47:20.589 --> 47:23.721
I feel like Tom Sawyer.

47:23.722 --> 47:25.320
We should definitely
fake our own deaths.

47:27.789 --> 47:29.147
Oh, excuse me,
blondie, I know you.

47:31.555 --> 47:33.654
You go to the posh school?

47:33.655 --> 47:37.020
Would you go with my pal?

47:37.021 --> 47:38.454
Where does he want me to go?

47:38.455 --> 47:41.787
I don't understand
what you're saying.

47:41.788 --> 47:42.820
Would you go with him,

47:42.821 --> 47:46.254
as in go with him?

47:46.255 --> 47:47.254
Uh... James, paddle.

47:50.222 --> 47:51.453
Oh, I love her,

47:51.454 --> 47:53.854
she's an English rose.

47:53.855 --> 47:55.854
But I bet she's 30.

47:55.855 --> 47:57.553
To deny the ned would be to deny

47:57.554 --> 48:00.353
the whole point of this town.

48:00.354 --> 48:01.820
What was that?

48:01.821 --> 48:04.820
I'm just saying,
this is a ned city now.

48:04.821 --> 48:06.553
It's a Victorian theme park,

48:06.554 --> 48:07.886
but it's run by neds.

48:07.887 --> 48:09.520
What happened to the Victorians?

48:09.521 --> 48:11.453
They built the city,

48:11.454 --> 48:12.853
they used the workforce,

48:12.854 --> 48:15.919
then they fucked off
with the money.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.986
I know more about the city
than I would say

48:17.987 --> 48:19.786
60 percent
of the local residents.

48:19.787 --> 48:21.353
- What?
- I do.

48:21.354 --> 48:24.019
I study the history
of this place, I've...

48:24.020 --> 48:26.320
I have.

48:26.321 --> 48:28.385
Sorry, James, you are English.

48:28.386 --> 48:29.719
No, I'm not.

48:29.720 --> 48:31.385
How long after you
were born in Scotland

48:31.386 --> 48:33.519
did you live in Scotland?

48:33.520 --> 48:34.853
All right, well, I was born here

48:34.854 --> 48:37.419
and then after like
six months we moved.

48:37.420 --> 48:38.986
Oh, that doesn't count.

48:38.987 --> 48:41.786
If you went to the pub now,

48:41.787 --> 48:42.619
around the corner,

48:42.620 --> 48:43.819
and you were like,

48:43.820 --> 48:45.652
"Hi, everyone, I'm Scottish,"

48:45.653 --> 48:47.185
someone would punch
you in the face.

48:47.186 --> 48:47.885
Absolutely.

48:47.886 --> 48:49.818
No they wouldn't.

48:49.819 --> 48:53.385
Maybe I'd punch them back.

48:53.386 --> 48:55.952
We're definitely a band now.

48:55.953 --> 48:57.985
Why are we a band now?

48:57.986 --> 49:00.751
This is something
only a band would do.

49:00.752 --> 49:03.085
This is band shit.

49:03.086 --> 49:05.418
Day trips, canoeing, kayaking.

49:07.652 --> 49:08.952
What do you think, James?

49:11.252 --> 49:14.084
I think we are
three people paddling a boat,

49:14.085 --> 49:16.518
that's all.

49:16.519 --> 49:18.918
So what makes a band then?

49:18.919 --> 49:22.184
You don't make a band,
a band makes you.

49:22.185 --> 49:25.951
It comes up
and sweeps you along.

49:25.952 --> 49:27.830
Do you know what, I think
it's possible that all

49:27.854 --> 49:30.017
the truly great records
have been made anyway.

49:30.018 --> 49:31.518
I mean, what's the point?

49:31.519 --> 49:32.851
Pop music's basically...

49:32.852 --> 49:36.117
it's been on the slide
since 1969.

49:36.118 --> 49:38.917
Do you have any idea
what he's talking about?

49:38.918 --> 49:40.317
Not really, but he
sounds quite sad.

49:43.651 --> 49:45.684
I'm going to be in Eve's band,

49:45.685 --> 49:47.584
and you can either
be in it or go back

49:47.585 --> 49:49.104
to posting up sad notices
in sad cafés.

49:52.518 --> 49:53.784
Thank you.

49:55.551 --> 49:57.884
There you are.

50:16.517 --> 50:18.449
So is this a regular thing
with you, James,

50:18.450 --> 50:22.217
just taking girls
on random day trips?

50:22.218 --> 50:25.516
Up until this point
I would have said no.

50:25.517 --> 50:27.282
I don't believe you.

50:27.283 --> 50:30.783
I think it's the one sneaky
little move you have.

50:41.283 --> 50:44.416
It's a good one.

50:44.417 --> 50:46.082
Thank you for helping.

50:46.983 --> 50:49.548
And, thank you as well.

50:53.583 --> 50:56.115
What did I do?

50:56.116 --> 50:57.348
I don't know.

50:57.349 --> 51:00.149
Okay.

51:00.150 --> 51:03.415
Steady.

51:03.416 --> 51:05.582
Steady there, me hearties.

51:05.583 --> 51:06.815
You can keep shouting,

51:06.816 --> 51:08.181
because as captain
of this vessel

51:08.182 --> 51:09.541
I'm going to have
to knock you out.

51:09.565 --> 51:10.564
James, just chill out.

51:14.182 --> 51:17.248
I drank too much wine.

51:17.249 --> 51:19.615
We know you did.

51:19.616 --> 51:22.181
You still feel like Tom Sawyer?

51:22.182 --> 51:24.248
A bit.

51:24.249 --> 51:29.181
Like Tom Sawyer when he's drunk.

51:40.748 --> 51:42.480
Hi, this is Dr. Callie Gretty
here,

51:42.481 --> 51:44.714
please leave a message
after the tone and...

52:17.814 --> 52:19.772
Okay, so what do you want
this band to sound like?

52:22.113 --> 52:23.513
Well, I don't know.

52:23.514 --> 52:25.272
I mean, do you really
have to think about it?

52:25.296 --> 52:27.079
Doesn't it just happen?

52:27.080 --> 52:30.346
Mostly it does, depends
on what kind of color

52:30.347 --> 52:31.580
you want to add to the songs.

52:31.581 --> 52:33.446
Do you want it
to just be us three?

52:33.447 --> 52:36.079
Yes, I... I don't
think I could handle

52:36.080 --> 52:37.646
any more people right now.

52:37.647 --> 52:40.413
So you don't want any drums?

52:40.414 --> 52:42.079
Or a bass?

52:42.080 --> 52:44.712
Well, wouldn't those things
just get in the way?

52:44.713 --> 52:47.079
I mean, wouldn't
they choke the sounds?

52:47.080 --> 52:49.679
Isn't that exactly what
happened with your band?

52:49.680 --> 52:51.478
Yeah, but those
guys were idiots.

52:51.479 --> 52:53.712
They... they didn't know
what they were doing.

52:53.713 --> 52:54.745
Let me just ask you this.

52:54.746 --> 52:56.645
The... the records
that you love,

52:56.646 --> 52:59.779
would you say
they were folk music,

52:59.780 --> 53:01.645
classical, jazz,

53:01.646 --> 53:03.145
or pop?

53:03.146 --> 53:04.846
Pop music.

53:04.847 --> 53:06.812
Then we're gonna
need drums and a bass.

53:06.813 --> 53:09.911
Ugh, but I don't want
any other people in the band.

53:09.912 --> 53:11.945
I think we can
make a nice sound.

53:11.946 --> 53:13.645
Ohh, we... we can
make a nice sound,

53:13.646 --> 53:14.964
yeah, there's
no doubt about that.

53:14.988 --> 53:16.612
But let me tell you this,

53:16.613 --> 53:18.145
if you want to hear
your voice floating

53:18.146 --> 53:20.224
in the middle of a beautiful
tapestry of frequencies,

53:22.645 --> 53:23.844
you're gonna need a pop group.

53:26.879 --> 53:29.711
Oh, okay, I just
thought about something.

53:29.712 --> 53:32.078
We get people to play drums
or bass or whatever we need,

53:32.079 --> 53:34.811
but we tell them right from
the start that we're the band.

53:34.812 --> 53:37.544
They do what they're told
or they can leave.

53:37.545 --> 53:39.110
But I mean, do you think people
would actually go for that?

53:39.111 --> 53:41.110
It's not like we're
experts or anything.

53:41.111 --> 53:43.944
That doesn't matter, no one
knows anything except you.

53:43.945 --> 53:45.504
You're the song writer,
you're the boss.

53:47.878 --> 53:49.377
So what do we do?

53:49.378 --> 53:50.678
Advertise.

53:50.679 --> 53:52.877
James can make one
of his super cool flyers

53:52.878 --> 53:54.311
and I won't steal it

53:54.312 --> 53:57.044
like I did last time.

54:02.444 --> 54:04.077
Can you do it, big man?

54:06.511 --> 54:07.950

and tell me what happens?

55:57.275 --> 56:00.041
Okay, okay, you've got me.

56:00.042 --> 56:02.574
Just sit, sit down.

56:02.575 --> 56:04.273
What are you doing here?

56:04.274 --> 56:05.507
We're not doing anything.

56:05.508 --> 56:08.707
But you've left a trail there.

56:08.708 --> 56:11.941
Okay, listen, shush.

56:11.942 --> 56:14.207
Shh!

56:14.208 --> 56:15.707
<i>Calma, shut up.</i>

56:15.708 --> 56:18.707
Listen to the guy,
he's got something to say.

56:18.708 --> 56:20.707
If you want to be in the band,

56:20.708 --> 56:23.806
got to listen to the guy, okay?

56:23.807 --> 56:25.106
The handsome guy, hm?

56:26.374 --> 56:28.873
Okay, this is what
we're looking for.

56:31.473 --> 56:32.506
There's this place
at the university

56:32.507 --> 56:33.746
where this other band rehearses

56:33.770 --> 56:35.573
and we can borrow their stuff.

56:35.574 --> 56:37.840
Apparently there's
twins in the band,

56:37.841 --> 56:38.840
and they're both hot.

56:41.907 --> 56:45.239
Are you all right?

56:45.240 --> 56:48.272
Yes, I'm fine.

56:48.273 --> 56:50.906
Shit, so we're
really gonna do this?

56:50.907 --> 56:53.406
Eve, your brother's here.

56:53.407 --> 56:54.606
You don't have a brother.

56:56.173 --> 56:57.772
Hi.

56:59.173 --> 57:00.639
One second.

57:04.407 --> 57:06.738
What's the deal
with the Swiss chap?

57:06.739 --> 57:09.705
The man mountain,
the yodeling flingy.

57:09.706 --> 57:11.939
The fuckish dilettante.

57:11.940 --> 57:13.538
What's a dilettante?

57:13.539 --> 57:14.738
I don't know, one who dabbles?

57:18.006 --> 57:19.738
Has he dabbled?

57:19.739 --> 57:21.238
Oh, he's tried.

57:21.239 --> 57:24.138
You let him?

57:24.139 --> 57:27.004
I was preparing to let myself.

57:27.005 --> 57:29.705
Then he got kind of hypnotized.

57:29.706 --> 57:32.705
My cleavage cast
a spell over him.

57:32.706 --> 57:33.871
Really?

57:33.872 --> 57:34.938
Is that usual?

57:34.939 --> 57:36.838
No, absolutely not.

57:39.372 --> 57:42.405
I go up and down quite a bit.

57:42.406 --> 57:44.771
Sometimes I quite like them,
feel ready to show the world,

57:44.772 --> 57:47.004
and other times I just
want to tape them up

57:47.005 --> 57:50.171
and go running
through the barley.

57:50.172 --> 57:53.437
How did you get in here?

57:53.438 --> 57:55.804
We said we had your inhaler.

57:55.805 --> 57:58.104
Can we get your room keys?

57:58.105 --> 57:59.470
What are you gonna do in there?

57:59.471 --> 58:01.237
We're gonna use your
guitar and your keyboard

58:01.238 --> 58:02.671
and write a new song.

58:02.672 --> 58:05.003
Okay, but don't
go through my stuff.

58:05.004 --> 58:07.237
No way, brother.

58:07.238 --> 58:08.937
We might even cook you dinner.

58:08.938 --> 58:10.270
What's the song like?

58:10.271 --> 58:12.037
A little bit Osmonds,
little bit Bowie.

58:12.038 --> 58:13.803
Oh, oye, no.

58:13.804 --> 58:15.304
Hey, I love him.

58:15.305 --> 58:16.803
I'm going through
a real phase with him.

58:16.804 --> 58:18.837
Yeah, of course you are,
every young girl your age

58:18.838 --> 58:20.636
goes through a phase with him,
which is fine,

58:20.637 --> 58:21.437
it's commendable.

58:21.438 --> 58:23.470
What are you talking about?

58:23.471 --> 58:25.503
I've never shed a tear
to a Bowie record.

58:25.504 --> 58:28.003
Uh, I'm sure he's really
going to be upset about that.

58:28.004 --> 58:29.403
Yeah, well, it's important.

58:29.404 --> 58:31.870
Music's meant
to move you or whether...

58:33.737 --> 58:36.269
Okay, and then, James,
can you bring the guitars in?

58:41.704 --> 58:44.670

So, is the band
going to have a name?

01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:20.098
Oh, no, not a name conversation.

01:01:20.099 --> 01:01:21.965
Why not a name conversation?

01:01:21.966 --> 01:01:24.164
Don't you think it's stupid
just to give yourself a name

01:01:24.188 --> 01:01:25.365
just because you sing songs?

01:01:25.366 --> 01:01:27.965
What, so the Beatles
were stupid?

01:01:27.966 --> 01:01:30.232
Well, they were kind of stupid

01:01:30.233 --> 01:01:32.232
if they actually
stopped to think about it.

01:01:32.233 --> 01:01:33.898
You definitely think too much.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.365
You think the fun out of things.

01:01:35.366 --> 01:01:36.898
I mean,
I... I'm a lifeguard,

01:01:36.899 --> 01:01:38.417
I work at a pool
with three other guys.

01:01:38.441 --> 01:01:39.998
We didn't give ourselves a name.

01:01:39.999 --> 01:01:41.832
What, like the Lifeboys
or something?

01:01:41.833 --> 01:01:43.431
That's pretty good.

01:01:43.432 --> 01:01:45.470
Look, I just don't want
to have a name conversation.

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.665
It's a Saturday,
right now all over this town

01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:50.131
hundreds of bands just like us
are having name conversations.

01:01:50.132 --> 01:01:52.331
Thousands of punks,
Goths, psychobillies,

01:01:52.332 --> 01:01:54.331
indie kids, rockers,
and just general knobheads

01:01:54.332 --> 01:01:57.864
are just sitting there arguing
about what to call themselves.

01:01:57.865 --> 01:02:00.031
I think you just hate people.

01:02:00.032 --> 01:02:02.565
I don't mind people.

01:02:02.566 --> 01:02:04.004
I just can't stand
collective idiocy.

01:02:06.465 --> 01:02:08.931
Maybe we should have a name

01:02:08.932 --> 01:02:11.031
that means something
really dirty

01:02:11.032 --> 01:02:12.271
but nobody knows what it means,

10cc, also named

01:02:28.834 --> 01:02:30.272

What?

01:09:41.986 --> 01:09:44.024
Since when? You never said
anything about a holiday.

01:09:44.048 --> 01:09:46.185
I know, I buried it
'cause I was dreading it,

01:09:46.187 --> 01:09:47.618
but there's no escape.

01:09:47.618 --> 01:09:50.118
A week in Bordeaux
with the family,

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.885
it's gruesome.

01:09:51.886 --> 01:09:54.285
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:09:54.286 --> 01:09:56.351
This is James and Cassie.

01:09:56.352 --> 01:09:58.585
This is Anton.

01:09:58.586 --> 01:10:01.752
May I talk to you for a minute?

01:10:01.753 --> 01:10:02.984
Sure.

01:10:02.985 --> 01:10:04.885
Bye guys.

01:10:14.885 --> 01:10:17.617
Who the fuck is he?

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:25.484
I'm just thinking about my tape

01:10:26.752 --> 01:10:29.751
that you gave
to the radio station.

01:10:29.752 --> 01:10:31.450
Mm-hm, what of it?

01:10:32.685 --> 01:10:35.184
I just think I
should do it again.

01:10:37.919 --> 01:10:40.584
It was too...

01:10:40.585 --> 01:10:43.250
I don't know, it feels
like a long time ago.

01:10:43.251 --> 01:10:45.384
I think I could do it
much better now.

01:10:45.385 --> 01:10:47.817
No, it's okay.

01:10:47.818 --> 01:10:49.817
How are you to know?

01:10:49.818 --> 01:10:52.883
It sounded very naive.

01:10:52.884 --> 01:10:54.983
You listened to it?

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.650
Well, yes, briefly.

01:10:57.651 --> 01:10:58.930
Wow, you must
have listened to it

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:01.050
straight after I gave it to you.

01:11:01.051 --> 01:11:03.416
Pretty soon, yeah.

01:11:03.417 --> 01:11:05.783
You had a tape player
in the van?

01:11:05.784 --> 01:11:07.462
One of the guys had
a radio cassette, yeah.

01:11:10.018 --> 01:11:12.017
So you all heard it.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:14.383
Those that were listening.

01:11:14.384 --> 01:11:17.316
And this is before
you gave it to Findley?

01:11:20.484 --> 01:11:21.563
I didn't give him the tape.

01:11:23.883 --> 01:11:25.882
What, why?

01:11:25.883 --> 01:11:28.383
Well, for a start it
was a little embarrassing.

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.483
What do you mean?

01:11:29.484 --> 01:11:30.715
Nobody hands in cassettes,

01:11:30.716 --> 01:11:32.183
especially not
to a radio station.

01:11:32.184 --> 01:11:33.782
That's not the point.

01:11:33.783 --> 01:11:36.749
It was from me for him
and he would have gotten it.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.183
I don't think so,

01:11:38.184 --> 01:11:39.283
and you could do better.

01:11:39.284 --> 01:11:41.116
You said so yourself.

01:11:41.117 --> 01:11:43.116
Fuck!

01:11:43.117 --> 01:11:45.549
It was hard to listen to.

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:47.949
You need someone else
to play guitar, not you.

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:50.949
You need to record
with proper equipment.

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:54.682
You know, your words are
depressing and self-centered.

01:11:54.683 --> 01:11:56.582
Your songs
are... are baby songs,

01:11:56.583 --> 01:11:58.682
they are songs for children.

01:11:58.683 --> 01:12:00.961
You're going to have to learn
to take criticism, you know.

01:12:00.985 --> 01:12:02.315
Fuck you!

01:12:18.382 --> 01:12:20.514
Where are you going?

01:12:25.448 --> 01:12:26.881
Church.

01:12:26.882 --> 01:12:28.347
Why?

01:12:28.348 --> 01:12:30.347
It's 'cause of the dream
I just had.

01:12:30.348 --> 01:12:32.748
What was the dream?

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:35.748
There's nothing more boring
than other people's dreams.

01:12:35.749 --> 01:12:37.581
No, I want to hear it.

01:12:38.649 --> 01:12:40.214
I dreamt I was dead

01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:46.481
and I could look back
on everything I'd done.

01:12:48.215 --> 01:12:49.780
Was I in it?

01:12:52.382 --> 01:12:55.214
I don't think so.

01:12:58.015 --> 01:12:59.847
It was like I'd been
sent back to pick through

01:12:59.848 --> 01:13:02.166
all the details of my past
with a massive magnifying glass.

01:13:05.015 --> 01:13:07.780
So what do you think it means?

01:13:07.781 --> 01:13:10.480
Every moment we have is

01:13:10.481 --> 01:13:11.914
actually much more important

01:13:11.915 --> 01:13:12.913
than we take it for.

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:15.946
So you're going to church.

01:13:21.447 --> 01:13:23.804
Just thought I'd go and see
if I could get the feeling back.

01:13:24.548 --> 01:13:26.646
So can I come with you?

01:13:28.381 --> 01:13:30.146
I'm just going
to wander down by myself.

01:13:32.347 --> 01:13:35.546
I'll see you back here later.

So you are James, please.

01:20:59.269 --> 01:21:00.934
How long have you known Eve?

01:21:02.968 --> 01:21:04.767
Um, just since
the start of the summer.

01:21:04.768 --> 01:21:05.967
Ah, and you are the boyfriend?

01:21:07.635 --> 01:21:09.333
No, uh, I'm the friend.

01:21:11.234 --> 01:21:12.267
Ah.

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:13.734
How's she doing?

01:21:15.301 --> 01:21:17.300
She's okay, now.

01:21:17.301 --> 01:21:18.934
Did you know that Eve
was in here before?

01:21:21.935 --> 01:21:23.333
Yeah.

01:21:23.334 --> 01:21:24.966
She left too soon.

01:21:24.967 --> 01:21:28.133
I advised her she wasn't ready,
but she didn't listen.

01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:29.933
Did she ever talk
about her illness?

01:21:30.668 --> 01:21:33.400
But you figured it out?

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.599
If you listen to the songs.

01:21:39.268 --> 01:21:41.400
The songs.

01:21:55.667 --> 01:21:57.633
How did you know where I was?

01:21:57.634 --> 01:21:58.953
Uh, it was me
that brought you in.

01:22:01.233 --> 01:22:03.533
Eve Alexander Carmichael.

01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:08.732
What the hell happened to you?

01:22:14.633 --> 01:22:16.565
What do you mean?

01:22:16.566 --> 01:22:18.732
All that day.

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:22.365
Where were you? You said
you were coming home.

01:22:22.366 --> 01:22:25.665
Well, I don't... I don't
tell you everything.

01:22:25.666 --> 01:22:28.565
I mean, it's not like
you tell me anything.

01:22:33.033 --> 01:22:34.671
Okay, I should leave you
to get some rest.

01:22:34.695 --> 01:22:36.899
No-no-no-no,
don't go, please.

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:39.031
I've had enough rest.

01:22:43.499 --> 01:22:46.031
Are you gonna be okay?

01:22:46.032 --> 01:22:47.764
Like, I mean, do you
want me to do anything?

01:22:47.765 --> 01:22:51.231
Just come and see me, okay?

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:54.898
And maybe bring Cass sometimes
if she can bear it.

01:22:55.899 --> 01:22:58.731
You've had a setback,
a predictable one.

01:23:02.298 --> 01:23:04.336
I mean, you must've had
some good times this summer.

01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:07.631
Yeah.

01:23:07.632 --> 01:23:10.497

your college application?

01:23:10.498 --> 01:23:11.998

01:26:46.392 --> 01:26:49.491
Of course, I couldn't
sing it like that.

01:26:49.492 --> 01:26:52.224
I wrote it for you.

01:26:52.225 --> 01:26:55.591
And do you think we might
do that one at the concert?

01:26:55.592 --> 01:26:56.791
Absolutely, we need that song.

01:27:07.526 --> 01:27:09.857
I don't know, James.

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:11.491
If you two don't get together,

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:14.324
then every song
and every film and every book

01:27:14.325 --> 01:27:17.324
I've ever heard, seen,
and read are wrong.

01:27:17.325 --> 01:27:19.857
It's different for us.

01:27:19.858 --> 01:27:21.791
She makes songs.

01:27:21.792 --> 01:27:23.358
She writes them.

01:27:23.359 --> 01:27:24.957
She's a character in them.

01:27:24.958 --> 01:27:26.991
It's her world,
and it's her private place,

01:27:30.191 --> 01:27:32.470
and it's the only thing that
really means anything to her.

01:27:33.391 --> 01:27:35.824
I don't suppose there's ever
been so much repression

01:27:37.658 --> 01:27:39.216
of true feelings
since Stalinist Russia.

01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:52.623
Letter!

01:28:17.757 --> 01:28:18.723
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:28:18.724 --> 01:28:19.623
Are you okay?

01:28:19.624 --> 01:28:20.623
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:28:20.724 --> 01:28:23.689
Are you okay to be here?

01:28:25.123 --> 01:28:26.755
Yeah, they know I'm here.

01:28:30.956 --> 01:28:33.522
They let you out pretty late.

01:28:33.523 --> 01:28:35.722
Uh-huh.

01:28:35.723 --> 01:28:38.455
Um.

01:28:38.456 --> 01:28:39.655
I think I might go to college.

01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:43.022
Music school in London.

01:28:44.823 --> 01:28:46.221
What do you think about that?

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:49.855
Um, I think,
why would you do that?

01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:55.855
Well, why not?

01:28:55.856 --> 01:28:58.921
'Cause you're already
better than anyone there.

01:28:58.922 --> 01:29:01.921
'Cause if any of the teachers
at this college

01:29:01.922 --> 01:29:05.221
had a fifth of your talent,
they wouldn't even be there.

01:29:05.222 --> 01:29:07.340
Because they're just gonna
try and make you sound like

01:29:07.364 --> 01:29:08.321
some asshole from TV.

01:29:08.322 --> 01:29:09.888
Well, I need to go somewhere.

01:29:09.889 --> 01:29:11.854
O, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

01:29:11.855 --> 01:29:12.988
I do, okay.

01:29:14.156 --> 01:29:15.754
I need order.

01:29:15.755 --> 01:29:16.788
And I need structure.

01:29:16.789 --> 01:29:18.854
And I need people.

01:29:18.855 --> 01:29:20.188
Grown up people.

01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:21.454
I mean, what are you gonna do?

01:29:23.388 --> 01:29:25.226
- What does that mean?
- What are you gonna do,

01:29:25.227 --> 01:29:26.927
you're just gonna sit around
here for the next ten years

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:28.854
getting more tired
and fed up with everything?

01:29:28.855 --> 01:29:31.487
You say we can make records,
how can we make records?

01:29:31.488 --> 01:29:34.521
You need money to make the kind
of records you wanna make.

01:29:34.522 --> 01:29:36.187
And even then,
who's gonna listen to them?

01:29:36.188 --> 01:29:38.026
You're the only person
that wants to hear them.

01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:40.521
Well, what's wrong with that?

01:29:40.522 --> 01:29:42.120
You can't make records
for anyone else.

01:29:42.121 --> 01:29:43.679
I mean, I don't care
if we made a record

01:29:43.703 --> 01:29:44.987
and no one bloody listened to it

01:29:44.988 --> 01:29:47.087
as long as it was a record
that we wanted to make.

01:29:47.088 --> 01:29:48.327
Well, I can't have that, James.

01:29:49.421 --> 01:29:50.553
Okay?

01:29:52.021 --> 01:29:54.139
I just, I've been inside
my own head for way too long.

01:29:56.587 --> 01:29:58.720
I want to sing,
and I wanna dance,

01:29:58.721 --> 01:29:59.953
and I wanna meet new people,

01:29:59.954 --> 01:30:01.073
and I don't wanna look back.

01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:03.787
Look.

01:30:08.254 --> 01:30:09.753
I like you, and I like Cass.

01:30:11.287 --> 01:30:13.019
I mean...

01:30:18.887 --> 01:30:20.419
...I love you and Cass.

01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.153
I'm just not going
back in that room.

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.638
And I'm not going back
to the hospital.

01:30:27.486 --> 01:30:29.219
You have to go back tonight.

01:30:31.653 --> 01:30:33.319
You know what I mean.

01:30:39.653 --> 01:30:42.519
I'm gonna take these
wet jeans off, okay?

01:31:00.586 --> 01:31:02.085
Thank you.

01:31:19.952 --> 01:31:21.484
What's the point in that?

01:31:23.085 --> 01:31:24.684
What?

01:31:26.385 --> 01:31:28.384
I mean, the time
for that was ages ago.

01:31:30.218 --> 01:31:32.017
When you were shagging Anton?

01:31:34.951 --> 01:31:36.217
No.

01:31:40.519 --> 01:31:42.117
What, when you were so mental

01:31:42.118 --> 01:31:43.636
you couldn't even
get dressed properly?

01:31:44.252 --> 01:31:46.017
Maybe.

01:31:51.785 --> 01:31:52.984
Maybe I didn't fancy you then.

01:31:55.451 --> 01:31:58.083
You fucking did.

01:32:22.217 --> 01:32:23.749
James.

01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:25.350
Mm?

01:32:25.351 --> 01:32:26.849
I wanna tell you something else.

01:32:28.884 --> 01:32:31.282
At the start of the summer,
just before I left the hospital,

01:32:37.183 --> 01:32:40.649
this woman came to cut hair,

01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:42.048
and when it was my turn,

01:32:42.049 --> 01:32:43.848
out of the blue she just
started talking to me

01:32:43.871 --> 01:32:46.349
and telling me that she healed
people while she cut their hair.

01:32:48.717 --> 01:32:51.616
You didn't think
she was just some nut?

01:32:51.617 --> 01:32:54.848
By that time I was
a nut's best friend, remember?

01:32:56.716 --> 01:32:59.074
So anyway, a couple of weeks ago
when I wasn't doing so well

01:33:00.383 --> 01:33:01.982
I went to her house.

01:33:01.983 --> 01:33:04.615
So did she cut your hair again?

01:33:04.616 --> 01:33:07.048
No, she...

01:33:07.049 --> 01:33:10.115
she told me to lie down.

01:33:10.116 --> 01:33:11.194
She had this massage couch.

01:33:14.249 --> 01:33:17.047
She put a blanket over me

01:33:17.048 --> 01:33:20.681
and she told me that she
practiced Christian healing.

01:33:20.682 --> 01:33:22.600
And I said, "What if you don't
believe in Jesus?"

01:33:24.948 --> 01:33:27.348
She said it would
still do me good.

01:33:29.782 --> 01:33:31.680
You don't believe in Jesus?

01:33:31.681 --> 01:33:33.281
Well, I know he was a man,

01:33:33.282 --> 01:33:35.280
I just don't know how much
of the story to believe.

01:33:38.382 --> 01:33:40.499
So, anyway, I shut my eyes,
and I imagined the desert,

01:33:42.414 --> 01:33:44.253
you know, like a Christmas card
with camels in.

01:33:46.581 --> 01:33:48.247
And then I thought,

01:33:48.248 --> 01:33:50.726
"What if the woman's hands were
his hands, would that help me?"

01:33:53.381 --> 01:33:56.480
And nothing happened.

01:33:56.481 --> 01:33:58.847
But then...

01:33:58.848 --> 01:34:00.647
my eyes were tight shut,
but I...

01:34:00.648 --> 01:34:02.147
I know this sounds stupid,

01:34:02.148 --> 01:34:05.913
but I felt like there was
a man standing over me.

01:34:05.914 --> 01:34:08.152
And I was too scared to open
my eyes up, I couldn't move.

01:34:10.714 --> 01:34:12.280
It was a strange moment,

01:34:12.281 --> 01:34:14.359
but it was like I knew that
this was my chance, like,

01:34:16.981 --> 01:34:20.180
like I could decide my own fate.

01:34:20.181 --> 01:34:21.379
So I started saying to myself,

01:34:24.114 --> 01:34:26.479
"I want to be better.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.946
I want to be well.

01:34:27.947 --> 01:34:30.913
I want to be better,
I want to be well."

01:34:30.914 --> 01:34:34.212
Over and over.

01:34:34.213 --> 01:34:36.312
And I suppose that was a prayer.

01:34:36.313 --> 01:34:37.679
After, did you feel any better?

01:34:41.413 --> 01:34:43.531
I mean, a few days later
I started feeling much worse.

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:48.279
You know, seriously panicking,
paralyzed in bed.

01:34:51.613 --> 01:34:52.612
What about now?

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:55.445
I feel...

01:34:58.113 --> 01:35:00.612
different.

01:35:00.613 --> 01:35:02.571
It's like she sort of
cleaned me out or something.

01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:06.698
Um, do you think you'll
still play the show?

01:35:08.713 --> 01:35:09.712
Yeah, I will.

01:35:12.613 --> 01:35:14.712
Just don't...

01:35:14.713 --> 01:35:16.591
don't tell Cass I'm leaving,
okay, just not yet.

01:35:18.446 --> 01:35:20.411
Okay.

01:35:20.412 --> 01:35:23.677
It was that sort of scrubby,
huge Jiffy bag on reception.

01:35:23.678 --> 01:35:25.145
Opened it, what did
we find in there?

01:35:25.146 --> 01:35:26.411
The world's last cassette.

01:35:26.412 --> 01:35:27.911
The world's last cassette.

01:35:27.912 --> 01:35:30.245
We had to roam the streets
looking for an old car

01:35:30.246 --> 01:35:32.345
and break into it with
a wire coat hanger,

01:35:32.346 --> 01:35:33.878
and play the cassette
in the car,

01:35:33.879 --> 01:35:34.878
and then we got arrested.

01:35:34.879 --> 01:35:36.444
Which means even if I could,

01:35:36.445 --> 01:35:40.011
I can't get along to
the old school house

01:35:40.012 --> 01:35:42.244
where God Help the Girl
is playing.

01:35:42.245 --> 01:35:44.477
But anyway, you have a good gig,
don't worry about us.

01:35:44.478 --> 01:35:46.110

Okay, I get that
most of the things

01:40:50.804 --> 01:40:53.102
that Eve says about me are true.

01:40:53.103 --> 01:40:56.369
I think she thinks I'm too
opinionated and bitter.

01:40:56.370 --> 01:40:59.969
I know she thinks I just
wanna be comfortable.

01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:01.129
But what's so bad about that?

01:41:04.137 --> 01:41:06.503
At least it's an ambition.

01:41:06.504 --> 01:41:08.935
I just want a period
of controlled happiness.

01:41:08.936 --> 01:41:11.435
Yeah, but you do it at
the expense of living,

01:41:11.436 --> 01:41:13.302
of all experimentation,
of all...

01:41:13.303 --> 01:41:15.935
Wai... wait a minute, you don't
get to come in here.

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:17.502
I'm telling my side
of the story,

01:41:17.503 --> 01:41:19.368
I've been waiting
all summer to do it.

01:41:19.369 --> 01:41:22.069
Okay, sorry.

01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:24.935
I've always dreamed
of making a record.

01:41:24.936 --> 01:41:27.635
I've always dreamed that
I could place a small flag

01:41:27.636 --> 01:41:30.001
in the timeline of pop history.

01:41:31.969 --> 01:41:35.201
This might seem preposterous
to you, but you know what?

01:41:35.202 --> 01:41:37.602
Fuck off, this is my dream.

01:41:39.169 --> 01:41:41.407
I just wanted to play a part,
but I never thought I could

01:41:42.969 --> 01:41:45.601
till Eve came along.

01:41:45.602 --> 01:41:47.734
Never came close.

01:41:47.735 --> 01:41:49.634
Without wanting
to sound blasphemous,

01:41:49.635 --> 01:41:51.501
I am the voice crying
in the wilderness,

01:41:51.502 --> 01:41:54.168
and she is my Messiah.

01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:56.934
I might not be fit to tie
her musical boot laces,

01:41:56.935 --> 01:42:00.001
but I could've
helped her make records.

01:42:00.002 --> 01:42:02.200
I could've listened to her songs

01:42:02.201 --> 01:42:04.439
and backed her up on simple
yet accurately played guitar.

01:42:06.968 --> 01:42:09.166
I could've designed the sleeves,
distributed the flyers,

01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:12.656
licked the envelopes,
whatever, I would've done it.

01:42:18.502 --> 01:42:20.467
Eve may go on to greatness,

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:22.633
but according to me

01:42:22.634 --> 01:42:25.466
the greatness already
happened this summer.

01:42:29.801 --> 01:42:32.566
The greatness of this summer
came from somewhere else.

01:42:32.567 --> 01:42:34.485
Just for a moment we were
all in the right place,

01:42:36.968 --> 01:42:39.067
and the possibilities
were infinite.

01:42:47.067 --> 01:42:49.266
Now I'll go back to my room.

01:42:49.267 --> 01:42:50.566
Eve will get on the train

01:42:50.567 --> 01:42:54.433
to a grown up life
free from neurosis.

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:56.600
Cassie will wonder
for a few moments,

01:42:56.601 --> 01:42:58.166
"What the hell
just happened?"

01:42:58.167 --> 01:43:00.532
before she gets torn back
into her own living delights

01:43:00.533 --> 01:43:01.899
and active miseries.

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:03.066
And I'll go back to my room.

01:43:09.767 --> 01:43:10.766
Was she on it?

01:43:10.833 --> 01:43:13.732
Yeah.
