02:45.100 --> 02:46.420
<b>Oh, Killua,</b>

02:46.790 --> 02:49.770
<b>I was about to go looking for you.</b>

02:49.770 --> 02:50.960
<b>Uh...</b>

02:50.960 --> 02:52.440
<b>Are you really healed?</b>

02:52.440 --> 02:53.470
<b>Yeah!</b>

02:57.980 --> 02:59.850
<b>See? I'm perfectly fine!</b>

02:59.850 --> 03:01.410
<b>Okay, I get it.</b>

03:01.950 --> 03:04.850
<b><i>Those injuries should've kept him 
out of action for four months,</i></b>

03:04.850 --> 03:07.160

03:07.160 --> 03:09.970
<b>Man, what is your body made of?</b>

03:09.970 --> 03:11.360
<b>How to answer that...</b>

03:12.010 --> 03:13.200
<b>You're weird.</b>

03:14.180 --> 03:14.930
<b>Well?</b>

03:14.930 --> 03:16.820
<b>Weren't you about to say something?</b>

03:16.820 --> 03:18.670
<b>Oh, here.</b>

03:20.450 --> 03:21.430
<b>Tickets?</b>

03:22.050 --> 03:23.930
<b>These aren't just tickets.</b>

03:26.070 --> 03:27.380
<b>They're for Hisoka's fight.</b>

03:30.690 --> 03:34.690
<b>As a 200s fighter, I got dibs on tickets.</b>

03:34.690 --> 03:36.990
<b>The tickets to Hisoka's match 
are a really hot item.</b>

03:36.990 --> 03:38.840
<b>There are even scalpers hawking them.</b>

03:38.840 --> 03:40.440
<b>Oh...</b>

03:40.440 --> 03:43.110
<b>So I've been gathering information.</b>

03:43.680 --> 03:45.710
<b>It turns out that Hisoka's the real deal.</b>

03:46.370 --> 03:49.350
<b>He has an 8-3 record, with 6 KO's.</b>

03:49.350 --> 03:51.800
<b>Each KO has led to death.</b>

03:53.410 --> 03:55.880
<b>But he's lost three matches...</b>

03:55.880 --> 03:58.700
<b>His three losses were due to forfeits.</b>

03:58.700 --> 04:00.360
<b>Forfeits?</b>

04:00.360 --> 04:02.550
<b>He reached the registration deadline,</b>

04:02.550 --> 04:05.300
<b>so he signed up for a fight, but didn't show.</b>

04:05.300 --> 04:06.890
<b>Which means...</b>

04:07.330 --> 04:10.890
<b>If Hisoka actually fights, he doesn't lose.</b>

04:11.820 --> 04:12.890
<b>Yeah.</b>

04:13.250 --> 04:17.590
<b>And he's only given up a total of four points.</b>

04:18.390 --> 04:21.760
<b>One knockdown, three clean hits.</b>

04:21.760 --> 04:24.830
<b>He's as strong as a Floor Master.</b>

04:25.820 --> 04:27.990
<b>I'm in trouble...</b>

04:31.570 --> 04:32.160
<b><i>Jeez.</i></b>

04:33.160 --> 04:36.170
<b><i>You don't look like someone who 
thinks they're in trouble.</i></b>

04:39.810 --> 04:42.670
<b>So, his opponent is some guy named Kastro.</b>

04:43.420 --> 04:47.150
<b>Two years ago, he claimed the sole 
knockdown against Hisoka.</b>

04:48.580 --> 04:52.740
<b>And of the four points scored against Hisoka,</b>

04:52.740 --> 04:54.850
<b>he's responsible for three.</b>

04:54.850 --> 04:56.800
<b>He scored three points against Hisoka...</b>

04:58.130 --> 05:00.520
<b>You could say they have a history.</b>

05:00.520 --> 05:04.060
<b>Apparently, they both registered for the 
same day so they could fight each other.</b>

05:06.520 --> 05:10.440
<b>You should have the chance to 
analyze Hisoka's fighting style.</b>

05:10.440 --> 05:12.510
<b>Maybe we'll get to see Hisoka go all-out.</b>

05:14.640 --> 05:16.410
<b>But is this okay?</b>

05:16.410 --> 05:18.540
<b>I promised Wing-san...</b>

05:19.190 --> 05:23.090
<b><i>I won't allow you to participate in 
any matches for two months!</i></b>

05:23.090 --> 05:26.750
<b><i>I won't allow you to train in, 
or study about, <i>Nen</i>.</i></b>

05:28.200 --> 05:30.230
<b>Of course it's okay!</b>

05:30.230 --> 05:32.560
<b>You'll just be watching a match.</b>

05:34.060 --> 05:35.560
<b>It is not okay!</b>

05:36.130 --> 05:39.890
<b>Viewing a match counts as learning about <i>Nen</i>.</b>

05:39.890 --> 05:41.730
<b>W-Wing-san...</b>

05:41.730 --> 05:43.320
<b>Don't scare us.</b>

05:43.940 --> 05:45.070
<b>Gon-kun,</b>

05:45.370 --> 05:47.460
<b>has your arm healed?</b>

05:47.460 --> 05:49.950
<b>Y-Yes! It's fine now.</b>

05:50.940 --> 05:53.330
<b><i>He has unbelievable regenerative powers.</i></b>

05:53.710 --> 05:56.560
<b>Since he's recovered, he can 
watch the match, right?</b>

05:56.560 --> 06:00.840
<b>No, I told Gon-kun to wait two months.</b>

06:02.980 --> 06:05.570
<b>Gon-kun, you should spend one more month</b>

06:05.570 --> 06:08.970
<b>practicing "Ten," and recovering 
from your injuries.</b>

06:08.970 --> 06:09.870
<b>Oh...</b>

06:09.870 --> 06:11.920
<b>Okay, I understand.</b>

06:11.920 --> 06:12.600
<b>Well,</b>

06:12.600 --> 06:14.170
<b>then it's fine.</b>

06:14.170 --> 06:15.980
<b>Osu! Take care.</b>

06:18.230 --> 06:20.120
<b>Oh, well...</b>

06:20.120 --> 06:22.320
<b>You'll have to watch a recording,</b>

06:22.320 --> 06:24.170
<b>so I'll go and see it in person.</b>

06:26.470 --> 06:28.490
<b><i>He's kept his promise.</i></b>

06:28.490 --> 06:31.120
<b><i>He's only practiced "Ten" each day.</i></b>

06:31.680 --> 06:35.270
<b><i>I can tell from the faint aura that surrounds him</i></b>

06:35.270 --> 06:37.620
<b><i>under normal circumstances.</i></b>

06:38.080 --> 06:42.880
<b><i>Their auras flow like serene rivers.</i></b>

06:45.130 --> 06:46.230
<b>Master?</b>

06:46.230 --> 06:47.050
<b>Hmm?</b>

06:47.050 --> 06:48.150
<b>Oh, never mind...</b>

06:48.150 --> 06:49.630
<b>It's nothing.</b>

06:51.380 --> 06:52.760
<b><i>This won't do...</i></b>

06:53.520 --> 06:56.890
<b><i>I'm the one who's losing control.</i></b>

07:01.470 --> 07:03.900
<b>Hello! I'm your announcer, Cocco!</b>

<b>The match doesn't start for another hour,</b>

07:30.850 --> 07:32.760
<b><i>This is a promise thread.</i></b>

07:32.760 --> 07:36.390
<b><i>It will be a visual reminder of your promise.</i></b>

07:57.410 --> 08:01.790
<b>Two years ago, Hisoka was 
the winner of their match.</b>

08:01.790 --> 08:05.850
<b>The audience is fired up to 
watch this match of destiny,</b>

08:05.850 --> 08:08.980

<b>we have the deadly magician with the 
tendency toward absence, Hisoka!</b>

<b>And opposing him, boasting a 9-1 record,</b>

08:21.400 --> 08:25.190
<b>one win away from the Floor Masters after 
nine straight wins since his loss to Hisoka,</b>

<b>Get ready for a battle between the two fighters</b>

08:34.260 --> 08:36.860
<b>nearest to reaching the Floor Masters!</b>

<b><i>Oh? I expected some kind of macho gorilla...</i></b>

08:41.360 --> 08:45.520
<b>Next up, we have an interview with 
Kastro, from a few days ago.</b>

08:47.630 --> 08:50.480
<b>I wouldn't fight if I didn't expect to win.</b>

08:50.480 --> 08:54.160
<b>You'll see that I'm not the same 
person I was two years ago.</b>

08:54.160 --> 08:56.670
<b><i>Oh, he sounds confident...</i></b>

09:01.060 --> 09:05.230
<b><i>We'll see if he can back it up.</i></b>

09:27.420 --> 09:29.130
<b>Wh-What?</b>

09:39.980 --> 09:41.010
<b><i>There he is.</i></b>

09:55.250 --> 09:56.780
<b>Was there something you needed?</b>

09:59.230 --> 10:00.280
<b><i>What?</i></b>

10:01.330 --> 10:02.530
<b><i>R-Ridiculous.</i></b>

10:03.510 --> 10:06.530
<b><i>He was just sitting on the couch...</i></b>

10:06.530 --> 10:07.540
<b><i>When did he move?</i></b>

10:08.230 --> 10:11.110
<b><i>Did he open the door and slip behind me,</i></b>

10:11.110 --> 10:13.090
<b><i>without catching my attention?</i></b>

10:13.090 --> 10:15.550
<b><i>No, that's impossible!</i></b>

10:16.350 --> 10:18.490
<b><i>I never took my eyes off the door</i></b>

10:18.490 --> 10:21.010
<b><i>until after he spoke.</i></b>

10:21.010 --> 10:23.060
<b><i>He never had the chance.</i></b>

10:23.060 --> 10:24.310
<b><i>How did he do this?</i></b>

10:25.620 --> 10:28.970
<b>W-Well, I was hoping for an autograph.</b>

10:28.970 --> 10:29.810
<b>From me?</b>

10:30.380 --> 10:32.560
<b>You honor me,</b>

10:32.560 --> 10:33.950
<b>Killua-kun.</b>

10:35.030 --> 10:38.790
<b>I keep tabs on all my rivals in the 200s class.</b>

10:38.790 --> 10:40.930
<b>You're not with Gon?</b>

10:40.930 --> 10:43.850
<b>Oh, so you do know everything.</b>

10:43.850 --> 10:46.150
<b>Are you here to scout an opponent?</b>

10:46.150 --> 10:47.000
<b>Nope,</b>

10:47.950 --> 10:50.500
<b>I just wanted a closer look.</b>

10:50.970 --> 10:53.750
<b>And what do you think?</b>

10:55.390 --> 10:56.760
<b>You're pretty damn good.</b>

10:56.760 --> 10:57.990
<b>Thank you.</b>

10:57.990 --> 11:01.120
<b>Your <i>Zetsu</i> was quite impressive.</b>

11:01.760 --> 11:03.530
<b>However, you should have</b>

11:03.530 --> 11:06.510
<b>concealed your presence 
before reaching this floor.</b>

11:06.510 --> 11:09.330
<b>When an aura as strong as yours disappears,</b>

11:09.330 --> 11:11.810
<b>that would put most of us on alert.</b>

11:11.810 --> 11:15.270
<b>You've been following up on me 
since I reached this floor?</b>

11:15.270 --> 11:16.510
<b>Pretty much.</b>

11:17.590 --> 11:19.240
<b>Then I want to know...</b>

11:19.240 --> 11:21.160
<b>How did you do that just now?</b>

11:21.160 --> 11:24.700
<b>Unfortunately, I can't tell you.</b>

11:24.700 --> 11:27.910
<b>After all, I might have to fight you someday.</b>

11:27.910 --> 11:29.660
<b>Don't worry.</b>

11:29.660 --> 11:32.120
<b>I'm not interested in fighting here again.</b>

11:32.120 --> 11:33.170
<b>Really?</b>

11:33.170 --> 11:35.830
<b>That isn't what your aura says.</b>

11:39.870 --> 11:41.410
<b>That was a joke.</b>

11:41.410 --> 11:43.570
<b>I'll answer your question when we fight.</b>

11:43.570 --> 11:45.300
<b>I'll wait for you in Battle Olympia.</b>

11:50.790 --> 11:52.480
<b>I'm sure you can get there.</b>

11:53.500 --> 11:55.810
<b>I told you I'm not interested in fighting!</b>

12:05.920 --> 12:07.830
<b>Yes, it's finally time...</b>

12:08.420 --> 12:12.330
<b>The long-awaited rematch between 
Hisoka and Kastro!</b>

12:13.470 --> 12:15.170
<b>I'm very grateful, Hisoka.</b>

12:15.740 --> 12:17.730
<b>If not for the initiation you gave me back then,</b>

12:17.730 --> 12:20.840
<b>I'd never have become this strong.</b>

12:22.840 --> 12:24.590
<b>You mean to imply that you're stronger now?</b>

12:24.590 --> 12:26.190
<b>Just so you're aware,</b>

12:26.190 --> 12:28.630
<b>I never used my full strength</b>

12:28.630 --> 12:32.100
<b>in any of the nine matches after my loss to you.</b>

12:32.620 --> 12:34.930
<b>Those matches were nothing more</b>

12:34.930 --> 12:37.110
<b>than a warm-up for my defeat of you.</b>

12:37.110 --> 12:38.730
<b>Begin!</b>

12:38.730 --> 12:39.530
<b>Here I come!</b>

12:50.610 --> 12:52.660
<b>A clean hit!</b>

12:52.660 --> 12:56.150
<b>Kastro has landed the first strike!</b>

12:57.730 --> 13:00.280
<b><i>What was that?</i></b>

13:02.640 --> 13:05.460
<b>Give me your best shot, Hisoka.</b>

13:08.910 --> 13:11.600
<b>Kastro is the one to land the first strike!</b>

13:12.060 --> 13:14.520
<b>Hisoka has surrendered the first point,</b>

13:14.520 --> 13:17.600
<b>after failing to evade Kastro's swift chop!</b>

13:21.160 --> 13:23.550
<b><i>Again... An illusion?</i></b>

13:27.790 --> 13:30.160
<b>I'm not the same person I was two years ago.</b>

13:30.160 --> 13:31.990
<b>I won't hold back on my next attack.</b>

13:35.190 --> 13:38.420
<b>You'll have my best shot when 
I deem it necessary.</b>

13:38.890 --> 13:40.580
<b>Very well.</b>

13:40.580 --> 13:43.310
<b>Then I hope you'll change your mind soon.</b>

13:55.370 --> 13:56.440
<b><i>Again...</i></b>

13:56.440 --> 13:58.600
<b><i>I was sure he dodged that!</i></b>

14:06.360 --> 14:07.270
<b>What's wrong?</b>

14:07.270 --> 14:09.410
<b>Will you just run around, rather than attack?</b>

14:18.500 --> 14:21.020
<b>Clean hit! And knockdown!</b>

14:25.710 --> 14:28.890
<b>What an amazing start!</b>

14:28.890 --> 14:31.640
<b>Kastro has been knocking his opponent around!</b>

14:31.640 --> 14:33.970
<b>The score is now 4-0.</b>

14:33.970 --> 14:38.100
<b>However, are my eyes deceiving me?</b>

14:40.010 --> 14:42.150
<b>Have you still not changed your mind?</b>

14:42.770 --> 14:47.900
<b>Would you prefer to die ignorant?</b>

14:49.160 --> 14:50.410
<b>C-Can you fight?</b>

14:58.480 --> 15:00.420
<b>If I am not mistaken,</b>

15:01.110 --> 15:03.800
<b>you seemed to disappear...</b>

15:04.870 --> 15:06.470
<b>That's right!</b>

15:06.470 --> 15:07.850
<b>He disappeared!</b>

15:07.850 --> 15:09.680
<b>That's what I saw!</b>

15:10.140 --> 15:11.510
<b>No,</b>

15:11.510 --> 15:14.680
<b>that is not an accurate description.</b>

15:15.730 --> 15:19.480
<b>You were readying a kick from the front,</b>

15:19.480 --> 15:21.940
<b>when suddenly, you were behind me.</b>

15:22.980 --> 15:26.960
<b>I suppose that would be more precise.</b>

15:29.300 --> 15:32.320
<b>But that doesn't sound right...</b>

15:33.000 --> 15:34.600
<b>Something is off.</b>

15:34.600 --> 15:35.700
<b>Yes,</b>

15:36.140 --> 15:40.330
<b>I feel I'm missing something very basic here...</b>

15:41.150 --> 15:42.700
<b>It's futile.</b>

15:42.700 --> 15:46.340
<b>If you continue to run in circles, 
you'll never learn the truth.</b>

15:47.080 --> 15:49.720
<b>Because I'm done waiting.</b>

15:49.720 --> 15:51.590
<b>I'll take your arm with my next strike.</b>

15:55.550 --> 15:57.600
<b>If you still will not attack,</b>

15:58.150 --> 15:59.710
<b>then so be it.</b>

16:02.020 --> 16:05.450
<b>It seems you weren't good enough.</b>

16:05.980 --> 16:08.280
<b>Tiger Bite Fist</b>

16:13.370 --> 16:15.020
<b>He's going to use his Tiger Bite Fist!</b>

16:15.020 --> 16:17.030
<b>Kastro's getting serious!</b>

16:17.560 --> 16:18.660
<b><i>Tiger Bite Fist?</i></b>

16:19.330 --> 16:20.380
<b><i>That technique</i></b>

16:20.380 --> 16:22.970
<b><i>can split a tree in two, when used by a master.</i></b>

16:23.550 --> 16:27.380
<b><i>Meanwhile, Hisoka still hasn't 
figured out Kastro's ability.</i></b>

16:27.830 --> 16:30.050
<b><i>Well, I don't really understand it, either.</i></b>

16:30.730 --> 16:33.550
<b><i>At this rate, Hisoka's gonna die!</i></b>

16:34.060 --> 16:34.930
<b>Here I come!</b>

16:40.510 --> 16:42.060
<b>Go ahead and take it.</b>

16:43.570 --> 16:44.570
<b>Not worried, huh?</b>

16:44.570 --> 16:46.520
<b>Or is this meant to be a trap?</b>

16:47.490 --> 16:48.570
<b>Either way,</b>

16:48.570 --> 16:49.820
<b>I'll take your arm!</b>

16:53.290 --> 16:54.530
<b>Your other one.</b>

16:58.670 --> 17:00.240
<b>Hisoka's arm!</b>

17:00.620 --> 17:04.020
<b>Hisoka's right arm has been severed!</b>

17:10.070 --> 17:13.720
<b>You shouldn't assume that 
I'll act the way you want.</b>

17:15.040 --> 17:17.720
<b>This was just part of the plan.</b>

17:17.720 --> 17:19.240
<b>What crap.</b>

17:25.800 --> 17:30.470
<b>Have we ever seen Hisoka in 
such a perilous situation?</b>

17:30.470 --> 17:33.800
<b>He's taken considerable damage!</b>

17:35.930 --> 17:37.380
<b>I understand.</b>

17:37.380 --> 17:39.490
<b>Your ability is, in fact,</b>

17:40.450 --> 17:43.120
<b>a double.</b>

17:43.840 --> 17:45.350
<b>Impressive.</b>

17:46.060 --> 17:47.620
<b>You are correct.</b>

17:48.110 --> 17:49.320
<b>A double?</b>

17:49.320 --> 17:50.880
<b>What does he mean?</b>

18:04.420 --> 18:07.020
<b>Then it wasn't an illusion!</b>

18:07.650 --> 18:09.990
<b>When Kastro attacked,</b>

18:09.990 --> 18:13.730
<b>there really were two of him.</b>

18:14.930 --> 18:18.060
<b>What is going on here?</b>

18:18.060 --> 18:21.200
<b>Kastro has split into two?</b>

18:21.200 --> 18:22.780
<b>Cloned himself?</b>

18:22.780 --> 18:25.200
<b>Instead of disappearing, he's multiplying!</b>

18:25.200 --> 18:28.050
<b>Does he actually have a twin?!</b>

18:29.100 --> 18:31.960
<b>Is this your doppelganger?</b>

18:32.460 --> 18:33.520
<b>Indeed.</b>

18:35.340 --> 18:37.560
<b>Doppelganger?</b>

18:38.140 --> 18:38.970
<b>Yes.</b>

18:39.530 --> 18:43.350
<b>Master, what does that mean?</b>

18:44.170 --> 18:48.100
<b>It refers to a double, as in an additional you.</b>

18:48.570 --> 18:50.930
<b>When you spot someone who resembles you,</b>

18:50.930 --> 18:53.420
<b>that's called a doppelganger.</b>

18:53.420 --> 18:55.860
<b>Er, I don't get it...</b>

18:56.350 --> 18:58.280
<b>When you encounter a doppelganger,</b>

18:58.280 --> 19:01.460
<b>you experience headaches and fatigue,</b>

19:01.460 --> 19:05.300
<b>which continue until your double is destroyed.</b>

19:05.830 --> 19:09.030
<b>Some believe that the double</b>

19:09.030 --> 19:13.100
<b>takes energy from the original.</b>

19:14.070 --> 19:16.990
<b>B-But Kastro-san isn't suffering at all.</b>

19:16.990 --> 19:18.580
<b>He's really strong.</b>

19:19.600 --> 19:21.760
<b>That's only a story.</b>

19:23.360 --> 19:27.760
<b>Besides, he mastered this 
ability through training.</b>

19:31.610 --> 19:33.650
<b>I listened to your warning,</b>

19:33.650 --> 19:36.860
<b>and I watched carefully, rather than run.</b>

19:37.860 --> 19:43.110
<b>And it turns out my deduction that 
you disappeared was correct.</b>

19:44.400 --> 19:49.590
<b>So why did I question that description?</b>

19:50.590 --> 19:52.670
<b>That's because</b>

19:52.670 --> 19:55.340
<b>I still sensed your presence beside me.</b>

19:56.160 --> 19:57.840
<b>In fact, right before you disappeared,</b>

19:58.890 --> 20:01.220
<b>I felt a new presence.</b>

20:02.470 --> 20:06.140
<b>You duplicate yourself before disappearing.</b>

20:07.460 --> 20:10.890
<b>I'm impressed that you managed to figure that out.</b>

20:10.890 --> 20:14.650
<b>I was able to successfully create a double with <i>Nen</i>.</b>

20:15.760 --> 20:17.960
<b>My double goes on the attack,</b>

20:17.960 --> 20:20.400
<b>while I hide in the shadows.</b>

20:21.070 --> 20:24.070
<b>As soon as you react,</b>

20:24.070 --> 20:26.910
<b>I dismiss my double, and attack.</b>

20:27.600 --> 20:32.260
<b><i>So those fluttering clothes were 
meant to help him hide.</i></b>

20:32.840 --> 20:34.770
<b><i>The most skilled Nen user would still experience</i></b>

20:34.770 --> 20:38.020
<b><i>difficulty in figuring out 
this trick, while in combat.</i></b>

20:39.720 --> 20:40.670
<b>Naturally,</b>

20:41.200 --> 20:43.720
<b>my double is no mere illusion.</b>

20:43.720 --> 20:47.680
<b>It exists as a second me until I send it away.</b>

20:48.610 --> 20:52.690
<b>You know this after suffering 
an attack from my double.</b>

20:53.080 --> 20:56.940
<b>In other words, you must fight both of my selves.</b>

20:59.960 --> 21:03.400
<b>This is the true Tiger Bite Fist, 
completed through the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.</b>

21:03.780 --> 21:06.410
<b>I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!</b>

21:05.070 --> 21:06.410
<b>True Tiger Bite Fist</b>

21:07.590 --> 21:11.100
<b>Incredible! We have an 
upset in the making!</b>

21:11.100 --> 21:14.620
<b>Hisoka, the winner two years ago, 
is in deep trouble!</b>

21:14.990 --> 21:19.140
<b>Will Kastro be able to avenge 
his previous defeat?</b>

21:19.140 --> 21:21.800
<b>Next, I will take your left arm.</b>

21:21.800 --> 21:25.430
<b>Will you continue to act disinterested?</b>

21:25.430 --> 21:28.170
<b>Hmm, let's see...</b>

21:30.890 --> 21:33.710
<b>I think I have a little motivation now.</b>

21:36.730 --> 21:39.450
<b>The fearsome double-user, Kastro,</b>

21:39.450 --> 21:41.200
<b>and the magician, Hisoka.</b>

21:41.200 --> 21:46.880
<b>Their incredible battle will have 
an unthinkable end,</b>

21:46.880 --> 21:49.210
<b>but Gon knows nothing of all this yet.</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Brush Your Teeth.

<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.860 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

<b>It's Gon</b>

<b>and Killua's</b>

<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.610 --> 23:11.750
<b>Today, we introduce Riehlvelt.</b>

23:11.090 --> 23:13.830
<b>A 200s class warrior.</b>

23:11.750 --> 23:14.660
<b>He uses his aura to move his wheelchair.</b>

23:13.830 --> 23:19.500
<b>Fights with <i>Nen</i> and his 
custom wheelchair 
and dual whips.</b>

23:14.660 --> 23:16.270
<b>He fights with two whips.</b>

23:16.270 --> 23:18.720
<b>There's probably a secret behind them.</b>

23:18.720 --> 23:19.870
<b>Whippie.</b>

23:24.550 --> 23:26.950
<b>Next time: A x Surprising x Win!</b>

23:26.950 --> 23:29.050
<b>Gon, if you could clone yourself,</b>

23:29.050 --> 23:30.190
<b>what would you do?</b>

23:30.190 --> 23:31.550
<b>Play rock-paper-scissors with myself!</b>

23:31.550 --> 23:34.300
<b>Wouldn't you always end up tying?</b>
