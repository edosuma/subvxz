00:04.471 --> 00:05.733
Mr. Jazz.

00:09.809 --> 00:12.004
- Yo, what up, pop?
- Home fry.

00:13.813 --> 00:16.303
- Will's in the kitchen.
- I can wait.

00:17.083 --> 00:20.883
- Why don't you sit here a little closer?
- Don't mind if I do.

00:21.321 --> 00:25.155
- Will you just get away from me?
- I love a woman who's hard to get.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.785
In that case, I want to marry you
and have your child.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.829
I'm down with that, too.

00:31.931 --> 00:33.865
- Sorry, Jazz.
- That's okay.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.561
I got a great view of her running out.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.670
- What up, J?
- Yo, Prince, I need a favor.

00:41.741 --> 00:44.539
Anything, man.
How many times you helped me out?

00:44.611 --> 00:45.771
Seven.

00:48.314 --> 00:50.339
- What do you need?
- A date.

00:51.418 --> 00:54.319
- Say no more!
- I want you to date my sister.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.278
Say a lot more.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.858
She just moved out here.
She hasn't had a date yet.

01:00.927 --> 01:04.488
- Prince, she really needs a man.
- But does she look good?

01:05.932 --> 01:08.765
Sure she does.
Good looks run in my family.

01:10.470 --> 01:15.066
Okay, Jazz.
Look, you know I'd do anything for you.

01:15.141 --> 01:17.109
- You're like a brother to me.
- Check.

01:17.177 --> 01:21.079
Which means that your sister should be
like a sister to me, not a girlfriend.

01:21.147 --> 01:24.583
If it doesn't work out,
it could jeopardize our friendship.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.881
I'm willing to take that risk.

01:28.021 --> 01:31.218
Look, my brother, I have to give this
some serious thought.

01:31.291 --> 01:35.284
- Can I bring her by just to meet you?
- Yeah, that's chill.

01:35.361 --> 01:38.853
Cool. Tonight, 8:00 sharp.
And try to smell good.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.638
Yo, big boy.
Give your sweet mama some sugar.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.717 --> 03:06.947
Okay. I did my budget
just like you told me.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.081
- Good for you. Let me see.
- This is the amount I made last week.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.957
These were my expenses.
I spent five times more than I made.

03:15.828 --> 03:18.228
This budget thing is pretty easy.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.930
Yo, G! Chill, man!
Whatever you do, don't open that door.

03:27.006 --> 03:31.340
- Please, Lord, tell me it isn't the police.
- No. It's my boy, Jazz.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.776
Much worse.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.905
Hey, G. $10 says I ain't home.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.945
It doesn't quite say it loudly enough.

03:41.154 --> 03:45.682
- Do I hear $15?
- G, you gonna do a brother like that?

03:45.758 --> 03:49.250
- My life's at stake.
- I took that into consideration.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.954
- Why don't you want to see Jazz?
- It's his sister I don't want to see.

03:54.033 --> 03:57.196
- Jazz is trying to set me up.
- Jazz has a sister?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.406
Nice to meet you, Dad.

04:10.049 --> 04:13.018
Mr. Jazz and Miss Janet.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.487
Prince, here she is.

04:20.627 --> 04:23.619
Janet, Will. Will, Janet.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.532
You don't have a goatee.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.429
Excuse me?

04:29.502 --> 04:33.131
Hi, I'm Vivian Banks, Will's aunt.
And this is my husband Philip...

04:33.206 --> 04:35.640
and our daughters Hilary and Ashley.

04:36.042 --> 04:39.341
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hey, meet me again.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.608
Why don't we all take a seat?

04:45.451 --> 04:49.547
May I get you anything, Master William?
A dribble bib?

04:52.091 --> 04:54.355
How long have you been in town?

04:54.427 --> 04:57.624
I just moved here.
I got a scholarship to go to UCLA.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.427
We certainly know who got the brains
in your family.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.798
Yeah, but Janet ain't stupid.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.907
So, Mrs. Banks,
Jazz tells me you're a college professor.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.603
That's right. I teach English.

05:11.678 --> 05:15.409
And Mr. Banks, Jazz tells me
you're a professional wrestler.

05:20.219 --> 05:23.017
I'm afraid he was mistaken. I'm a lawyer.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.387
My apologies. I was misquoted.

05:28.294 --> 05:31.127
I went to UCLA.
Do you want to use my books?

05:31.197 --> 05:34.098
Thanks. I was thinking
of buying used books.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.468
Well, these aren't used.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.434
- Come take a look at them anyway.
- Okay.

05:41.107 --> 05:44.201
Jazz, I'm going to go into the kitchen
for a snack.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.938
When I come back, I want you gone.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.880
Guess I got plenty of time then.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.622
Will, I think Janet likes you.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.021
I definitely think she's up on me.

05:59.092 --> 06:03.426
You know, it's probably not too late
to get that spinach out of your teeth.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.929
So, what do you think?

06:07.333 --> 06:11.235
Brother, do the words "boing-yoing-yoing"
mean anything to you?

06:12.105 --> 06:15.597
I can't wait to go out with your sister.
Thanks for putting me "D," man.

06:15.675 --> 06:20.339
Man, I'm having second thoughts.
See, Prince, you're like a brother to me.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.181
If you date my sister
and it doesn't work out...

06:23.249 --> 06:25.513
it could jeopardize our friendship.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.577
I'm willing to take that risk.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.957
In that case,
how much are you willing to give?

06:33.092 --> 06:34.184
Give?

06:34.527 --> 06:38.327
You know, to take her out.
I'd sure look good in this jacket.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.030
I should have known.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.271
The hat, too.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.301
The hat.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.240
Let me get a good look at this shirt.

06:57.550 --> 07:01.611
I must say
Mr. Jazz's sister is quite a charmer.

07:01.687 --> 07:05.418
Yes, she is. Makes me question
the whole theory of genetics.

07:06.459 --> 07:10.520
Come on, Philip, it was awfully nice
of Jazz to introduce Will to his sister.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.086
He's a good friend.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.532
My brothers and sisters, I've got a date.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.668
- You know what would be fun?
- I can think of a couple of things.

07:28.915 --> 07:33.147
It would be fun to take your cousin
Ashley out sometime. I love kids.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.146
- Yeah, word. Kids are great.
- Do you want kids of your own?

07:37.223 --> 07:40.056
- Definitely.
- You'd be a great dad.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.017
You, too, baby.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.924
I probably shouldn't tell you this...

07:47.667 --> 07:50.898
but the moment I saw you
I knew we'd be great together.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.064
I hope it wasn't
the leather jacket that did it.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.898
Don't be silly. You're not wearing
the jacket now, are you?

07:58.878 --> 08:00.903
And I never will be again.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.207
Clothes don't make the man.

08:04.717 --> 08:07.880
And, Will, you are my man.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.254
Oh, man.

08:21.734 --> 08:24.134
Maybe we should look at the menu.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.832
If I can get my eyes to focus.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.836
I am getting a little hungry.

08:30.910 --> 08:34.607
Baby, have the lobster, have the caviar.
Anything you want.

08:34.813 --> 08:38.773
I know I don't want lobster and caviar,
they're much too expensive.

08:39.385 --> 08:42.320
You're right.
We are going to be great together.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.019
- Hi, I'm Gia.
- Hi, I'm Will.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.218
- You ready to order?
- We certainly are.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.695
- Not.
- Then I'll come back.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.763
William, can we get one thing straight?

08:58.337 --> 09:02.501
When you are with me, I don't want you
to be looking at other women.

09:06.078 --> 09:10.276
- What other women?
- Please. I saw you looking at that waitress.

09:10.349 --> 09:14.479
So you can just put those googly eyes
back in your head, all right?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.550
Hello? I said, all right?

09:20.426 --> 09:21.893
All right.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.153
Gia?

09:26.799 --> 09:29.893
I'd like the swordfish and a salad.
No dressing.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.833
What about you, Will?

09:32.138 --> 09:33.662
I'll have the...

09:41.480 --> 09:45.712
- I'll have the steak. Rare.
- Steak is really unhealthy.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.679
- Do you need another minute?
- No. He'll have the same thing I'm having.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.747
Plus a baked potato.
No butter, no sour cream.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.554
- Thank you.
- Got it.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.592
I like sour cream.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.200
You used to.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.630
From now on,
you need to watch that cholesterol.

10:06.706 --> 10:09.573
I'm not having my husband dying
of a heart attack at 40...

10:09.642 --> 10:12.509
and leaving me to raise six kids by myself.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.446
Six kids?

10:20.052 --> 10:22.953
That's right, baby. Three girls, three boys.

10:23.022 --> 10:26.458
And don't even think about naming
one of them William.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.817
Janet, hold on. Wait a minute.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.963
Don't you think it's a little early
to be talking about marriage?

10:36.035 --> 10:39.266
Excuse me?
Then what did you have in mind?

10:39.905 --> 10:42.738
I don't know.
Dinner, maybe a dance or two.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.599
Is that right?

10:44.677 --> 10:48.238
A moment ago, you were chewing
on my earlobe, Mr. Niblet.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.275
Did you think you could sample the milk...

10:52.351 --> 10:55.149
without putting a down payment
on the cow?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.885
I ordered lemonade.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.589
You're not gonna drink it.
You're cutting out sugar, too.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.325
No husband of mine will sit around
getting fat and watching TV all day...

11:06.399 --> 11:10.529
and leaving me with all the work
of raising six kids by myself. No.

11:13.639 --> 11:16.073
- But...
- But, nothing.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.739
And look at me when I'm talking to you!

11:24.817 --> 11:27.149
William, who are you looking at?

11:32.124 --> 11:35.855
Hi, Hilary. Did a guy named Michael call
while I was in the shower?

11:35.928 --> 11:39.659
- No. Who is he?
- Just a boy in my class.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.899
- Do you like him?
- Sort of.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.338
- Was he supposed to call?
- He said he would.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.600
I can't stand it when men do this.

11:48.674 --> 11:51.905
They say they'll call, so you wait and wait.
And nothing.

11:51.977 --> 11:55.674
Do they think we have nothing better
to do than sit by the phone?

12:00.219 --> 12:03.052
Hello? Hello, Michael.

12:05.925 --> 12:09.884
I'm glad you found a time
that was convenient for you to call.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.096
No, Ashley is not here.

12:13.165 --> 12:16.692
I don't know where she is.
She may not be back for several days.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.030
- Hilary!
- I know what I'm doing.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.971
You want her to call you back?

12:23.042 --> 12:26.876
Yeah, that'll be happening,
Mr. God's Gift to the Fifth Grade.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.573
Don't you feel great?
Brisk walk in the morning...

12:32.651 --> 12:35.313
and now you're exercised
and ready to start the day.

12:35.387 --> 12:38.220
Yeah. We got any more
of those pecan rolls?

12:39.759 --> 12:43.217
Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, I need your help.
I'm having girl problems.

12:43.295 --> 12:46.093
- Didn't your date go well last night?
- No.

12:46.298 --> 12:50.257
What's the matter, baby?
You like Janet more than she likes you?

12:51.370 --> 12:52.997
I don't think so.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.067
Well, I sure liked her.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.373
I hope so, since we'll probably
be living here with our six kids.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.209
- Kids?
- She told me last night we're having six.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.306
Not anytime soon, I hope.

13:04.383 --> 13:07.875
She doesn't want to start a family
until we've finished graduate school...

13:07.953 --> 13:10.945
worked at least five years
and have complete dental benefits.

13:11.023 --> 13:15.050
- That sounds very sensible.
- Aunt Viv, this is all before we had salads.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.991
Why don't you tell her
you're not interested?

13:18.063 --> 13:20.429
I tried, man. She just won't listen.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.089
<i>It's like Fatal Attraction.</i>

13:22.168 --> 13:26.605
I'm telling you, if we had a bunny,
dude would be on the stove right now.

13:31.043 --> 13:35.002
- Come on, Will.
- I'm telling you, this babe is tripping.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.811
She's already telling me
what to do, what to eat, where to look.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.749
Well, women get like that.

13:43.856 --> 13:47.189
- Get like what?
- You know.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.994
No, Philip, I do not. Women get like what?

13:53.132 --> 13:54.463
Like that.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.898
You say something, William?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.242
Master William,
Mr. Jazz is here to see you.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.412
Thank you, G.

14:09.448 --> 14:13.111
What do women get like? I am waiting.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.214
Hello!

14:22.194 --> 14:23.957
Prince, is your uncle here?

14:24.029 --> 14:26.361
I think I dislocated my hip
last night dancing.

14:26.432 --> 14:29.162
I don't want to risk getting thrown out.

14:30.069 --> 14:33.129
Yo, man, what's up?
Come on, man, that tickles.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.240
I want my clothes back, Jazz.
You set me up with a maniac.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.777
Your sister's the bossiest woman
in the world.

14:39.845 --> 14:42.939
- I know.
- You know?

14:43.215 --> 14:46.013
She gets on my last nerves.
Ever since she moved out here...

14:46.085 --> 14:49.248
she's been hanging out at my place,
bossing me around all the time.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.915
I had to pawn her off on some sucker.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.490
Setting me up.

15:03.836 --> 15:08.205
Between you and the Humpty Dance,
I'll get a metal plate put in my butt.

15:08.274 --> 15:12.074
You deserve it. Your sister showed up
here at 7:00 to pick out my clothes.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.169
By 10:00, she phoned five times.

15:14.246 --> 15:18.478
I'm telling you, she'd be here now
if she wasn't out shopping for my beeper.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.221
Are you saying your relationship
isn't working out?

15:23.355 --> 15:25.482
What relationship? I just met her.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.991
If you're thinking about breaking up
with her, you better think again.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.655
Last guy that tried to cut her loose...

15:32.064 --> 15:33.691
it wasn't pretty.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.795
Dude, he's walking and all, but still.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.503
- What am I supposed to do?
- I say, marry her.

15:46.145 --> 15:49.012
You can stop that.
Homes, I'm breaking up with her.

15:49.081 --> 15:52.517
Well, if she kills you, can I have that shirt?

15:54.720 --> 15:58.451
- No, you can't have this shirt, Jazz.
- I got an idea.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.755
I set you two up
to get her out of my face, right?

16:03.028 --> 16:05.792
So why don't you set her up
with some other sucker?

16:06.265 --> 16:10.133
I ain't living like that. What guy deserves
a woman like your sister?

16:10.202 --> 16:11.567
Hi, fellas!

16:15.841 --> 16:18.503
Hope you don't mind,
I borrowed your Public Enemy tape.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.341
- You like Public Enemy?
- They're not half bad.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.689
That used to be my favorite song.

16:34.059 --> 16:38.496
You know, Carlton, I misjudged you.
You're a lot cooler than I thought.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.926
You want to go
to the club with us tonight?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.934
Sure, but I don't have a date.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.903
Carlton, never bring a sandwich
to a buffet.

16:48.974 --> 16:51.169
And what is boyfriend having?

16:52.044 --> 16:55.138
The green-grass salad
with blue-cheese dressing.

16:57.549 --> 17:00.177
- Nix the blue cheese.
- Got it.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.453
Janet! Kiss, kiss.

17:06.825 --> 17:10.089
- Janet, meet Toni. Toni, Janet.
- Oh, Janet.

17:10.162 --> 17:13.256
I have a sister named Jane,
but we call her Amy.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.662
You know Carlton and Will.

17:16.734 --> 17:20.068
And a little further down
on the evolutionary chart, Jazz.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.297
She noticed me.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.609
- Hi, Carlton. Hi, Will.
- How you doing, Toni?

17:27.378 --> 17:30.906
- That's my cousin's best friend.
- Do I look like I care?

17:32.551 --> 17:36.112
Aren't you feeling well, Janet?
You seem a little cranky.

17:38.657 --> 17:42.616
She's just kidding around, Carlton.
That's what makes her so much fun.

17:42.694 --> 17:45.595
Will, this is a great jacket.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.326
Thanks.

17:49.701 --> 17:52.192
Are you, like, saying grace or what?

17:53.038 --> 17:55.632
Yeah, I've been praying a lot lately.

17:55.874 --> 17:58.502
If you don't stop talking
out of the side of your mouth...

17:58.577 --> 18:01.375
you're going to be talking
like that permanently.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.811
Break out the Midol.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.650
Would you ladies care to join us?

18:09.721 --> 18:13.418
Maybe later. We have to see
if anyone better is here first.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.052
- Isn't that Patrick Swayze?
- I don't know. You tell us, Carlton.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.997
You see, Janet, not only
is Carlton brilliant and handsome...

18:21.066 --> 18:23.364
he also knows everybody who's anybody.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.802
- Ain't that right, Jazz?
- Does he know Janet Jackson?

18:27.406 --> 18:29.101
William, ever since we got here...

18:29.174 --> 18:32.473
you've been going on and on
about Carlton this and Carlton that.

18:32.544 --> 18:35.536
Boy, save your charm
for the girl on your arm.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.950
Someone has her rude hat on tonight.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.351
William, my soda is warm.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.685
Yo, Gia.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.852
I need more ice.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.028
You need more ice, what?

18:54.533 --> 18:57.661
I need more ice in my warm soda.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.205
You need more ice, please.

19:04.576 --> 19:09.172
- What did you say to me?
- He said, "You need more ice, please."

19:10.949 --> 19:12.211
Heads up.

19:15.354 --> 19:18.255
Will, I'm sorry. I've got to say something.

19:18.590 --> 19:22.617
Janet, your behavior this evening
has been completely unacceptable.

19:22.694 --> 19:23.922
Carlton.

19:24.596 --> 19:27.030
Where I come from,
manners count for a lot.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.862
I'm sorry I've got to say this...

19:28.934 --> 19:32.335
but I simply can't sit back
and allow this rudeness to continue.

19:32.404 --> 19:35.805
You owe every one of us an apology,
especially that poor waitress.

19:35.874 --> 19:39.901
If you refuse, we're taking you home
and continuing the evening without you.

19:39.978 --> 19:41.878
Do I make myself clear?

19:48.153 --> 19:50.485
You know, I'm going to miss him.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.521
Do I make myself clear?

19:59.298 --> 20:00.993
Yes, Carlton.

20:10.442 --> 20:13.843
Carlton was a little bit of that.
I didn't know he had it in him.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.743
He stood right up to Janet and said:

20:15.814 --> 20:19.113
"Baby, that's about all that lip
I'm going to have."

20:20.385 --> 20:23.149
Boys, you've got a lot to learn
about women.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.385
Carlton has obviously
been watching me in action.

20:27.859 --> 20:30.885
Now, Will, your Aunt Vivian
can be quite bossy at times.

20:30.963 --> 20:34.922
But when she starts bossing me around,
I don't let it bother me.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.367
I just say no in a strong, masculine voice.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.928
And when I say no, she jumps.

20:42.474 --> 20:43.805
Excuse me.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.938
What did you say?

20:48.380 --> 20:51.213
I don't know.
How long have you been there?

20:52.985 --> 20:56.386
I came in on, "Your Aunt Vivian
can be quite bossy sometimes."

20:56.455 --> 20:58.218
You didn't hear the part where I said:

20:58.290 --> 21:01.817
"Boys, the rest of this statement
is completely untrue."

21:02.794 --> 21:05.695
Philip, you better sleep with one eye open.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.699
I got her just where I want her.

21:13.872 --> 21:17.239
You know, I've learned something
from all this, Jazz.

21:17.409 --> 21:20.572
- You know what every woman wants?
- Rib tips?

21:24.549 --> 21:28.280
No, Jazz.
Every woman wants a man to take control.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.688
That's what Carlton did with Janet.

21:30.756 --> 21:34.192
If he can make it work for him,
imagine what I could do.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.961
You did an excellent job
on those apology notes.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.657
- I'll mail them right away.
- Mail them?

21:39.965 --> 21:43.696
- I'm sorry, Carlton. I'll hand-deliver them.
- That's better.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.460
I'll get your coat.

21:49.341 --> 21:51.536
I really should write a book.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.913
Okay. Jazz, I know how to check a woman.
Watch this.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.516
Yo, Janet!

22:05.290 --> 22:08.589
Peep this here, baby.
We're going out tonight.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.225
I'm gonna choose the place.

22:11.296 --> 22:15.164
I'm gonna eyeball any honey
that I darn well please, all right.

22:15.233 --> 22:19.363
Then I'm gonna order a steak
with a big bucket of blue-cheese dressing.

22:19.738 --> 22:21.638
Do I make myself clear?

22:22.007 --> 22:26.068
The only thing clear about you
is the space between your ears.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.613
Why the hell didn't that work?

22:34.386 --> 22:38.083
You got the theory right.
You just ain't got the technique.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.722
Take notes. Hilary!

22:43.395 --> 22:44.487
What?

22:46.064 --> 22:50.501
Hilary, your behavior at the club last night
was completely unacceptable.

22:50.802 --> 22:53.635
Where I come from,
manners count for a lot.

22:53.939 --> 22:57.375
Now, I'm sorry to have to say this,
but I simply can't sit here...

22:57.442 --> 22:59.967
and allow this rudeness to continue.

23:00.178 --> 23:02.078
Do I make myself clear?

23:06.618 --> 23:07.949
Come here.
