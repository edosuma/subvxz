00:08.960 --> 00:11.645
Unh! What the hell?

00:12.160 --> 00:14.128
Just something to help you relax.

00:17.960 --> 00:22.522
You really don't have any idea who I am,
do you, Mr. Salinger?

00:25.360 --> 00:27.283
Save your breath, sweetheart.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.168
You're gonna need it.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.126
It's me. I'm back.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.766
- How was Chicago?
- Oh, God, you know.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.770
All these conferences
are such a waste of time.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.644
You, how was your day?
How was work?

01:20.840 --> 01:24.208
- Fine. Except for Carlton.
- Again?

01:24.400 --> 01:27.847
He keeps leering at me.
Gives me the creeps.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.562
Well, he's your boss. Sooner or later
you have to report him to HR.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.121
I'm so glad you're back.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.842
I have a surprise for you.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.007
- You're giving me a drawer?
- Only if you want it.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.967
I mean, if it's too soon.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.527
I just thought it might be nice.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.446
What you're asking me to do...

02:20.600 --> 02:24.525
I appreciate that you turned yourself in.
You came back for me.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.848
Liz, I'm in danger.
I need the passports.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.050
- I can't. I just can't.
- Liz, please!

02:30.240 --> 02:33.483
Turning myself in
to save you saved me.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.441
And not because the judge let me go.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.803
I've been running since I was 14.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.369
It's all I've known.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.045
When the judge let me go...

02:45.240 --> 02:48.210
...I thought, "Maybe there's a world
where I don't have to run...

02:48.400 --> 02:50.448
...where I could just..."

02:53.120 --> 02:55.202
These Germans want me dead.
My handler too.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.364
So please, I need your help.
I need the passports.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.562
They're not just passports.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.128
You put them in a box
under the floor in our home.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.482
They represent everything
I'm trying to forget.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.047
- I wouldn't ask, but it's important.
- They're in evidence.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.526
So they're still clean.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.961
I'm not gonna walk into evidence
and steal them.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.004
- Why would I do that?
- You want me gone?

03:16.360 --> 03:19.569
- Do this and you'll never see me again.
- You need to leave.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.490
Go. Now. No.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.323
Get out.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.361
I was out, remember?

03:31.600 --> 03:34.001
You're the one
who brought me back in.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.965
Get out.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.408
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.206
- I came home and Tom was here.
- He's back in your life.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.368
- He is not in my life.
- I understand...

04:02.560 --> 04:05.370
...what it's like to be drawn
to something that is unhealthy...

04:05.560 --> 04:08.643
...to a part of yourself
that you are afraid of.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.925
But I want you to remember
what your life really was with him...

04:13.120 --> 04:16.488
...and imagine all
that it could be without him.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.290
I don't have to imagine.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.365
Good.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.524
Because I have a case.

04:35.720 --> 04:40.647
Toshiro Osaka, a Japanese entrepreneur,
indicted in 2009...

04:40.880 --> 04:43.406
...and knifed to death
by an aggrieved business partner.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.729
Miles Chapman,
he was gunned down in Algiers...

04:46.920 --> 04:49.491
...while avoiding extradition
for insider trading.

04:49.720 --> 04:50.926
Lester Charles Conway...

04:51.120 --> 04:54.920
...his Ponzi scheme was so massive,
he's now serving up to 30 years.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.282
Their crimes cost
people their life savings...

04:57.520 --> 05:00.364
...pensions gone, homes in foreclosure,
families torn apart.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.085
Why would I feel bad for them?

05:02.320 --> 05:04.687
According to Reddington,
they're innocent...

05:04.880 --> 05:07.565
...framed after months,
sometimes years...

05:07.760 --> 05:10.809
...of planning by a woman
with a deep hatred for the 1 percent.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.447
She doesn't just take their money,
she takes their reputations...

05:14.640 --> 05:18.008
...their freedom,
sometimes their lives.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.931
Her latest mark was Declan Salinger...

05:21.120 --> 05:24.249
...a flamboyant venture capitalist
who specialized in biotech.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.081
He was found last night in a hotel
bathtub, needle on the floor...

05:28.280 --> 05:30.442
...dead from an apparent overdose.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.524
His personal laptop
was taken into evidence.

05:33.720 --> 05:37.327
CSI uncovered corporate withdrawals
in excess of 27 million.

05:37.560 --> 05:42.168
Navabi, go see Salinger's wife. Ressler,
Keen, the man in prison, talk to him.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.368
If he was framed, I want to know how.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.084
We spoke to your attorneys,
Mr. Conway.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.290
You claim to have been framed by
a woman named Claudia Sanchez.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.244
Or whatever her name really was.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.171
- She made everything up.
- She make up the Ponzi scheme?

05:57.360 --> 06:00.569
The 128 million you stole from
your clients to fund your lifestyle.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.604
- The ranch, the private jets...
- I've told this story before.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.764
We were sleeping together.
She had access to everything...

06:06.960 --> 06:09.804
...my phone, computer, passwords.
If you don't believe me...

06:10.000 --> 06:12.844
We want to believe you. We do.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.121
Tell us what happened.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.080
She was a seasonal worker
at the ranch.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.409
Undocumented, one of many.
My wife had no idea.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.762
The affair lasted exactly six months.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.601
Then one day, she just disappears.
Three days later, I'm arrested.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.848
Well, they also found
a packed bag in your car...

06:30.040 --> 06:32.040
...and your passport
and a plane ticket to Beijing.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.003
She planted it all.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.607
That woman, she was diabolical.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.087
From the fingerprints on the suitcase...

06:39.280 --> 06:42.090
...to the airline ticket she purchased
using my computer...

06:42.280 --> 06:43.520
...she got into my life.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.200
- Abby Issa.
- But that was nothing.

06:47.400 --> 06:51.291
The way she moved the money,
her knowledge of how it worked...

06:51.480 --> 06:54.609
...issuing false statements,
creating shell companies.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.962
I hired the best defense
money could buy.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.003
After they looked at the evidence...

06:59.200 --> 07:01.043
...they recommended I cop a plea.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.244
Beretta 21A Bobcat.
Packs a nasty bite.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.051
If I ever have to use it,
that's exactly what I want it to do.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.330
I pled guilty to a crime I didn't
commit. That's how good she was.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.002
And the money she took,
most of it belonged to my clients...

07:15.240 --> 07:17.686
...teachers, doctors, pension plans.

07:17.880 --> 07:22.329
Over 278 people lost everything
because of some ghost.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.887
Never went to trial,
but your lawyers...

07:25.080 --> 07:28.766
...you said that they gathered
a lot of evidence. We need to see it.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.684
- Hello, Roger.
- The Director called for a vote.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.245
- When?
- Tomorrow.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.448
I've been quietly lobbying
on your behalf.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.406
- I appreciate that.
- No, you don't. You expect it.

07:47.240 --> 07:51.006
- Where do things stand?
- I've spoken to Mitchum. He's with us.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.210
That means Brazil
and South Korea are as well.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.290
That likely positions Jasper
as the deciding vote.

07:57.480 --> 08:02.008
If we can't secure his vote, the Director
will have a majority to act against you.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.444
- Then Jasper will have to be persuaded.
- These are powerful men.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.201
- They don't respond to threats.
- No.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.883
With powerful men,
one must appeal to their vanity.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.491
Listen to me, Red.

08:15.720 --> 08:20.931
The Fulcrum, if you have it,
if you can prove you have it, do it now.

08:21.120 --> 08:24.522
- Your life depends on it.
- Set the meeting.

08:34.039 --> 08:37.726
Mrs. Salinger had a detective
follow her husband and his mistresses...

08:37.919 --> 08:39.967
...for months.
Found nothing on this woman.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.690
Partial prints, burner phones...

08:41.880 --> 08:44.451
...inconclusive selfies taken
from the victim's phone.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.246
Conway's lawyers did three months
of discovery before the plea.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.206
All they got were payroll records, fake
green cards and social security numbers.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.482
Lawyers interviewed
the staff they could find...

08:53.720 --> 08:58.044
...but no one could or would positively ID
the woman Conway alleges framed him.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.766
Two different cases,
two sets of investigators...

09:00.960 --> 09:04.009
...and this woman didn't leave a trace.
- Guys, check it out.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.443
Detectives and lawyers didn't find
anything conclusive on their own...

09:07.600 --> 09:11.047
...but if you put
the photos they found together...

09:14.240 --> 09:16.607
...our ghost has a face.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.801
Okay, so I have this friend,
Osborne, in the forensics lab...

10:07.040 --> 10:09.725
...Freaking Osborne.
- Aram.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.125
Right. So I scanned
over 40 partial prints...

10:13.320 --> 10:15.482
...Conway's investigators
found at his ranch...

10:15.680 --> 10:19.446
...another 53 partials found
by Mrs. Salinger's private detective.

10:19.680 --> 10:25.323
I fired them off to Osborne. He is
a wizard with whorls, loops and arches.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.131
He managed to stitch
together three partials...

10:28.320 --> 10:32.723
...into a gorgeous,
crystal-clear left thumbprint.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.924
Ran it through AFIS and bang.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.442
Her name is Vanessa Anne Cruz.
36 years old.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.689
Last known address, her mother's
place in Edison, New Jersey.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.325
Get there. Now.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.807
SWEET'S "DRINK YOU SOBER"
PLAYING]

10:51.120 --> 10:52.963
Abby?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.411
Drink it.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.361
Ah...

11:10.600 --> 11:15.208
♪ Oh, dear, look what you've done ♪

11:17.760 --> 11:19.171
Take off your clothes.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.249
♪ You've made a mess of me ♪

11:21.440 --> 11:25.650
♪ And I don't want to clean up ♪

11:26.200 --> 11:28.123
♪ I'm dangerously high ♪

11:30.720 --> 11:34.520
♪ You've seemed to quench my appetite ♪

11:37.560 --> 11:42.043

12:05.680 --> 12:07.205
Abby?

12:08.160 --> 12:09.764
Abby!

12:19.160 --> 12:22.801
- Who the hell are you?
- Andy, from the front desk.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.927
She gave me 20 bucks
and told me this key belongs to you.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.445
Aida Hernandez? Special Agent
Donald Ressler, Special Agent Keen.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.640
We're trying to locate your daughter,
Vanessa Cruz.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.404
MY daughter?

12:43.400 --> 12:44.561
She's dead.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.689
It's my fault.

12:49.880 --> 12:53.362
Vanessa never really had
a good male role model.

12:53.560 --> 12:58.009
Her father was a creep, so I wasn't
surprised when she married one.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.646
- Wash, rinse, repeat.
- Excuse me?

13:00.880 --> 13:04.487
Some women make the same mistakes
with men over and over again.

13:04.720 --> 13:08.805
Hernando was a young broker,
worked at a big firm.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.968
Turns out, he was a real crook.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.650
He was doing insider trading...

13:12.840 --> 13:16.890
...and when they caught him, he jumped
off the George Washington bridge.

13:17.080 --> 13:21.847
- And what happened to Vanessa?
- Oh, she thought they set him up.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.361
She adored him till the end.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.562
Never questioned his innocence.

13:26.760 --> 13:30.003
I tried to reason with her, but...

13:33.160 --> 13:35.003
Take your time.

13:35.800 --> 13:41.284
They found her folded clothing
at Rockaway Beach.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.449
They never found a body,
but I know she was dead.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.041
- She'd never abandon me.
- She looked after you?

13:49.240 --> 13:51.766
She was such a beautiful person.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.327
Never a thought of herself,
always of others.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.928
- And since she's been gone?
- She made sure I'd be well taken care of.

13:58.120 --> 14:02.205
- How did she do that?
- She had an insurance policy.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.649
I kept up with the mortgage
and made ends meet.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.890
- Do you still have the policy?
- I never saw the policy.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.880
But I have a letter that came with
the check. I'm sure I can find that.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.680
It turns out it's a fake.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.325
- What is?
- The entire company.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.490
Minnetonka Bankers Health & Life
was incorporated in 2006.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.684
In nine years, the only policy it
issued was to Cruz's mother.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.764
- It's a shelf corporation.
- You mean shell corporation?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.371
No, shelf with an F.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.360
Criminals file incorporation papers.
Pay all the fees. It's totally legitimate.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.444
Then they put them on the shelf
for years, sometimes decades.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.445
Pay the minimum corporate tax,
build up a credit rating...

14:39.640 --> 14:41.768
...comply with filings
to create an established...

14:41.960 --> 14:45.567
...creditworthy business that can
launder all kinds of transactions.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.650
- Including phony insurance payments.
- Guys.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.208
This isn't the only way
Vanessa Cruz has used shelf companies.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.724
Six others were accused of funneling
money through shelf corporations.

14:56.920 --> 15:00.402
Samar, you said these corps
are being sold to criminals.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.807
If we find the person
who sold them to Cruz...

15:03.040 --> 15:05.247
Then we might find Cruz.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.690
Put me in touch with someone...

15:07.920 --> 15:11.049
- ...who brokers shelf corporations.
- Good.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.480
I need the Fulcrum.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.527
Our ghost has a name, Vanessa Cruz.
If I can find who brokered her...

15:17.720 --> 15:19.768
Agent Keen,
I'm loathe to play tit for tat...

15:19.960 --> 15:22.611
...but unfortunately,
due to present circumstances...

15:22.800 --> 15:24.529
...I must insist on the Fulcrum.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.690
I'm afraid it's become an immediate
matter of life and death.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.611
- I know how much it means to you.
- I don't think you do.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.202
And you know how much it means to me
to know what part I play in this.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.404
But you told me it's a blackmail file
and I'm a federal agent.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.682
I can't just hand
over information to you...

15:39.880 --> 15:43.248
...that might give you leverage
over people who run our government.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.967
Those people launched a missile strike
on the Factory to kill us...

15:47.160 --> 15:50.323
...to keep their secret a secret.
- This is about Tom, isn't it?

15:50.520 --> 15:53.967
No. This is simply
about me trying to survive.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.810
I'm perfectly happy to put you
in touch...

15:56.000 --> 15:59.721
...with someone who deals in shelf
corporations, but I need the Fulcrum.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.888
Think about it, Lizzy.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.090
Sorry, man. Sorry.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.411
- Yeah?
- It's me.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.443
I need your help.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.322
The case I'm on,
our perp funneled money...

16:39.560 --> 16:42.882
...through a shelf corporation called
Minnetonka Bankers Health & Life.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.971
You must know people who provide
these types of services to people like...

16:47.160 --> 16:49.891
- To people like me?
- Yes, to people like you.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.647
Isn't Reddington your Cl? Why isn't he
here? Still upset about last night?

16:54.840 --> 16:58.890
I told you, if you help me with this case,
I would get you those passports.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.170
We're not discussing Reddington
and me. We need to talk about this case.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.011
Now, these are two other shelf corps
our unsub set up.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.200
Andrusia Industries,
Middle Leaf Properties.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.448
Are these supposed
to mean something to me?

17:16.680 --> 17:20.765
All three of those shelf corps
are named after Minnesota lakes.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.361
When investigating you,
I found the shelf corp...

17:23.599 --> 17:25.762
...where you had the money
Berlin paid you...

17:25.960 --> 17:29.169
...Owasso Inc., also a Minnesota lake.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.961
I'll talk to my contact,
see what I can find.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.403
- No, I'll talk to your contact.
- How about we go together?

17:39.320 --> 17:40.890
What's so urgent?

17:41.120 --> 17:44.408
I wanted to talk to you
about Raymond Reddington.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.125
The vote's not until tomorrow.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.163
Vote's all but taken. Not officially...

17:48.360 --> 17:51.011
...but I've spent six hours
speaking with the players.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.329
- You're back channeling?
- You're damn right.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.525
If Reddington has the Fulcrum,
his death triggers a protocol for release.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.842
- We will be exposed.
- And why am I here?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.804
You're the swing vote, Kenneth.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.809
The one that will make this decision.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.526
You know I lean towards the Director.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.248
- Why should I change that position now?
- Because, Mr. Jasper...

18:11.480 --> 18:15.405
...you strike me as a man who would
prefer to pitch rather than catch.

18:16.680 --> 18:22.244
- What the hell have you done?
- Just hear him out. That's all I ask.

18:22.440 --> 18:27.162
Roger is quite right.
The Director's latest stratagem is hubris.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.089
It has very little to do with me...

18:29.280 --> 18:32.568
...and everything to do with
the consolidation of his power.

18:32.760 --> 18:38.051
If he succeeds, you'll become nothing
more than his trusted servant.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.961
He needs to go. He will go.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.970
Tomorrow, after the meeting...

18:45.160 --> 18:49.165
...after you win this vote,
with everything that your head...

18:49.360 --> 18:52.409
...and your heart tell you are true.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.443
You're talking about assassination.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.688
Yes, Mr. Jasper.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.087
Ambition's debt must be paid.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.685
Julius Caesar?

19:00.880 --> 19:03.690
One of my favorites.
The play, not so much the man.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.564
The man was a bit full of himself.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.845
He did have a brilliant military mind, but
he couldn't smell a plot to save his life.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.003
- Intentional pun.
- And why is that?

19:12.200 --> 19:13.486
Pride.

19:13.680 --> 19:18.641
The subtlest and yet most
deadly of the seven sins.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.487
Like the Director,
he couldn't be saved.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.246
And which part do you play in all this?

19:25.440 --> 19:27.966
- Cassius?
- Oh, no.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.208
I'm the Rubicon.

19:31.240 --> 19:36.849
You simply need to determine which
side of history you want to end up on.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.088
Who are you, Mr. Jasper?

19:39.320 --> 19:43.484
A subordinate who remained
slavishly obedient to his master...

19:43.680 --> 19:46.490
...or the presumptive leader
of an organization...

19:46.680 --> 19:50.162
...that will be far more powerful
than it has ever been?

20:04.120 --> 20:06.646
Diamond Drive Properties.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.330
Oh, my God.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.363
- Heh. Billy! Heh, heh.
- Hey.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.843
- Come here, you.
- How you doing?

20:17.040 --> 20:20.886
- Ziggy, this is Liz. Liz, this is Ziggy.
- What brings you two here?

20:21.080 --> 20:25.563
Big favor. My friend here was a gull in
a con game and she lost a lot of money.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.603
- Oh, that's too bad, baby.
- Turns out...

20:27.800 --> 20:31.521
...she was hustled
by one of your clients.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.769
- You know better than this.
- I know. But I need an address.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.641
Look, the people we work for are serious.
If we don't get that money back...

20:41.640 --> 20:45.565
- You his woman?
- I'm more like his ball and chain.

20:47.040 --> 20:51.329
Yeah. So, what do you say?
Can you help us? Please?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.571
Hey. How about a thank you?

20:57.760 --> 21:01.082
Ressler, I've got a mailing
address for Cruz.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.843
- Clear.
- Clear.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.845
Clear.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.330
Agent Ressler?

21:46.040 --> 21:48.361
I've got dozens of files,
photos, dossiers.

21:48.560 --> 21:51.484
She went through the trash, hacked
their networks. Listen to this.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.650
Copies of Declan Salinger's
bank statements, medical records.

21:54.840 --> 21:58.367
There's even surveillance photos.
Every book and video...

21:58.560 --> 22:01.609
...he's ordered for three years.
- Did you say dozens of files?

22:01.840 --> 22:03.640
This goes beyond the names
Reddington gave us.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.531
People she's framed,
people she's thinking of framing.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.569
Aram, you wouldn't believe this place.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.246
Hair, threads, lint, bits of carpet,
cigarette butts.

22:11.440 --> 22:15.684
All collected, categorized
and filed under each victim's name.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.486
Trace evidence to be planted
at crime scenes.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.050
Drew Roberts.
He was one of Cruz's victims.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.722
- He worked at Oakside Investments.
- And?

22:25.920 --> 22:29.561
That was the firm that employed
Cruz's dead husband.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.530
Aram, I might have an idea
what this is all about.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.560
I'm no worse than
your buddy Reddington.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.371
He's not my buddy.
And you are worse.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.085
You don't get it.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.645
Even after all this time, Reddington...

22:49.880 --> 22:51.882
...is dangerous and he is playing you.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.447
He's more dangerous
than you give him credit for.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.808
But he has a moral code.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.846
I don't like it, but at least I know what
it is. It does not include lying to me.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.963
Whatever you say.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.051
- You want to know what I'm gonna do?
- No.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.328
- I'm gonna buy a boat.
- A boat?

23:09.480 --> 23:12.211
Mm-hm. A diving boat.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.688
Gonna run it down to Micronesia,
open up a charter business.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.091
Ever hear of Chuuk Lagoon?

23:18.280 --> 23:20.601
An old Japanese naval base
in the South Pacific.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.964
February 7, 1944, sunk 12 warships,
32 support vessels...

23:25.160 --> 23:27.970
...and now they're just lying
at the bottom of the ocean.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.808
It's a diver's paradise.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.883
- You don't even know how to swim.
- I know.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.449
But I can learn.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.326
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.363
Sorry I'm late.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.404
- I did it. I talked to an attorney.
- About Carlton?

23:54.600 --> 23:55.806
Yes.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.891
And I think I have a case, that I should
file a claim with HR for sexual harassment.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.168
- You did the right thing.
- It only happened...

24:02.360 --> 24:05.842
...because you gave me the courage.
Thank you.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.530
We're gonna celebrate.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.087
I'll book a room at the Wolverton...

24:11.280 --> 24:15.080
...and we're just gonna order room
service and watch movies all night.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.327
I love you.

24:18.360 --> 24:22.046
- Abby...
- No. I mean it.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.560
I know that we said we weren't
gonna get super serious...

24:26.760 --> 24:30.128
...but I can't help it.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.810
I love you.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.809
What is it?

24:41.160 --> 24:43.083
I love you too.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.044
Well, I'm assuming you don't want me
to walk you to your door.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.003
Thank you.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.725
Hey, can I ask you something?

25:25.600 --> 25:27.887
Do you think it's possible...

25:29.000 --> 25:30.684
...for, uh...

25:31.880 --> 25:34.042
...someone like me to...

25:36.040 --> 25:40.170
...start over, to become something else?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.084
Isn't that what you do for a living?

25:44.720 --> 25:46.370
Yeah.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.245
But, uh...

25:50.040 --> 25:51.201
...you know what I mean.

25:54.160 --> 25:58.165
Can you be honest?
You have to be honest.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.531
Tom...

26:02.000 --> 26:05.891
...our entire marriage,
everything that happened...

26:06.120 --> 26:08.851
...our fights, the baby...

26:10.120 --> 26:11.849
...your laugh...

26:14.960 --> 26:17.884
It couldn't have all been pretend.

26:18.560 --> 26:21.040
You're not that good an actor.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.847
That's why I didn't see it...

26:25.040 --> 26:29.125
...because so much of it was real.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.684
You are my greatest failure
as a profiler.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.087
You're my greatest success.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.049
You made me feel...

26:43.240 --> 26:45.208
...for a moment...

26:46.840 --> 26:51.323
...like I had a life
and that somebody cared.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.289
So this is me being honest.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.328
Can you be honest
about the passports?

26:59.520 --> 27:02.524
- Passports?
- They're real. Government issue.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.683
Where'd you get them?

27:05.400 --> 27:07.323
Berlin had a guy.

27:09.160 --> 27:13.927
- I guess not.
- Wait, wait, wait. I can't.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.730
- Not about this.
- That's not how the truth works.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.968
You don't get to pick and choose.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.726
Not if you want to learn how to swim.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.722
It's gonna be a nice boat.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.886
What was that?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.963
That was goodbye.

27:58.680 --> 27:59.920
That won't be necessary.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.044
Mr. Hobbs here
is one of the good guys.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.131
How are Faye and the boys?

28:07.320 --> 28:10.005
You know, I don't think I've seen
them since Dylan's wedding.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.646
They're fine. Mark and his wife
just had a baby girl.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.446
Oh, grandfather. Well, it suits you well.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.608
Wisdom of the ages and all.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.844
Where is everybody?
I thought I was late.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.883
The vote's already been taken.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.529
Roger.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.200
Roger, Roger, Roger.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.410
I always treated you with respect.

28:37.600 --> 28:41.889
We may not have seen eye to eye,
but I always heard you out.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.684
I don't know what he's told you...

28:43.880 --> 28:47.043
I brought you in. I was your sponsor.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.725
Yes.

28:48.880 --> 28:53.169
- Look, I told him that Reddington...
- Reddington did not make you.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.850
We made you.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.368
Have you forgotten what
this organization has done for you?

28:59.680 --> 29:02.286
Government contracts? Silverstone?

29:02.480 --> 29:03.891
R&D grants?

29:04.080 --> 29:07.562
We put you in the game
and you betray us?

29:07.800 --> 29:12.601
You betray me? I treated you like family.
I supported you.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.564
- Then just hear me out.
- Shh-shh-shh.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.242
There is a car waiting for you outside.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.721
- You are going to the airport.
- Please.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.206
Uh-uh.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.368
You are leaving the country tonight.

29:24.560 --> 29:29.646
You are not to call your family,
and you are never coming back.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.804
It's not about money. It's about revenge.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.722
Aram, can you put up all the files?

29:55.920 --> 29:59.811
Hernando Cruz jumped off that bridge
after being accused of insider trading.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.446
Purchased 10,000 shares
in Rudman Pharmaceuticals...

30:02.640 --> 30:06.122
...one day before it got approval from
the FDA to market a new cancer drug.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.328
That stock doubled overnight.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.841
Toshiro Osaka,
our Japanese entrepreneur...

30:11.040 --> 30:12.610
...when Cruz made the trade...

30:12.800 --> 30:15.644
...Osaka was the CFO
at Rudman Pharmaceuticals.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.571
Miles Chapman, he was the regulator
who approved the drug.

30:18.760 --> 30:22.287
And Drew Roberts was Cruz's co-worker
who oversaw all of the trades.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.050
They were in on it
with the husband?

30:24.240 --> 30:25.890
Maybe the husband wasn't in on it.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.208
- Maybe they set him up.
- It makes sense.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.845
Vanessa is a frame-up artist.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.883
Maybe she got the idea
from seeing them...

30:32.080 --> 30:33.684
...frame her husband.
- Wait.

30:33.880 --> 30:37.601
The evidence you found in Cruz's loft
suggests she targeted dozens of victims.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.881
All one-percenters.

30:39.080 --> 30:42.163
People who personify the same greed
that cost her husband his life.

30:42.400 --> 30:47.167
If she's going after everyone who framed
her husband, the question is, who's left?

30:47.400 --> 30:50.722
I don't know. But I do know
someone who can tell us.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.127
Before making a fortune
in the private sector...

30:53.320 --> 30:56.369
...you worked for the division
of corporate finance at the SEC.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.801
So? Did you look
at the research I gave you?

30:59.040 --> 31:00.849
- Tell us about Cruz.
- Did you find anything?

31:01.080 --> 31:04.607
Hernando Cruz. He was a trader
for Oakside Investments in 2008.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.040
Killed himself when you were
about to investigate him...

31:07.160 --> 31:10.767
...for insider trading.
- So? What does that have to do with...?

31:10.960 --> 31:12.720
You were looking
for the woman who set me up.

31:12.760 --> 31:15.491
It was his wife who set you up,
and now we know why.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.485
Along with Toshiro Osaka,
Miles Chapman and Drew Roberts.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.284
Tell us about Hernando Cruz.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.807
He didn't jump off that bridge,
did he, Lester?

31:25.160 --> 31:27.367
Don't look so depressed.
Today's your lucky day.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.086
We found out who framed you.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.084
Cruz.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.202
- It was his wife?
- Maybe we can help you.

31:36.400 --> 31:39.324
Maybe you can talk to us,
and maybe we can make a deal.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.490
It was 2007, before the crash...

31:46.680 --> 31:50.241
...height of subprime mortgages,
bundling, things that really hurt people.

31:50.440 --> 31:54.240
But this, it was a victimless crime.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.643
We had every angle covered.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.763
Trading floor,
the regulatory agencies.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.361
You made the SEC look the other way.

32:01.880 --> 32:05.202
- I want a lawyer.
- No, no, no. What you want is a deal...

32:05.440 --> 32:07.886
...and you'll only get that
if you keep talking.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.765
So talk.

32:12.360 --> 32:17.810
Everyone was going to look
the other way, except that kid, Cruz.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.169
He found out, went to his boss.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.681
We tried to keep him quiet,
but he refused.

32:23.480 --> 32:26.086
- Too idealistic.
- So you were a part of a conspiracy...

32:26.280 --> 32:29.045
...and when Cruz tried to go against you,
he was murdered.

32:29.240 --> 32:32.562
Thrown off a bridge to keep him
from blowing the whistle.

32:32.800 --> 32:36.407
That's when you framed him,
which is why she framed you.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.291
When I knew her,
she was nobody, a ranch hand.

32:39.480 --> 32:41.687
- How did she...?
- If Cruz went to his boss...

32:41.880 --> 32:43.245
...why was it never reported?

32:43.480 --> 32:46.211
- Because his boss was in on it.
- What was his name?

32:51.120 --> 32:53.009
Mason Carlton, Thundridge Capital.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.961
Cruz has taken revenge on everyone
but this guy. Find him, Aram.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.448
I called Carlton's office,
nobody's picking up.

33:29.640 --> 33:34.726
His cell is going straight to voice-mail. But
get this, I accessed his cell records...

33:34.920 --> 33:38.720
...and I found a ton of inappropriate
messages with his assistant.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.241
Her name is Abby Issa.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.602
Either she's having an affair
with her boss...

33:43.800 --> 33:46.485
Or he's being catfished.
You said she was his assistant?

33:46.680 --> 33:50.366
So she has the keys to the kingdom.
Passwords, financials, credit cards.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.369
There's a hit on
Mason Carlton's AmEx.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.166
He reserved a room for tonight
at the Wolverton hotel.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.764
Hello?

34:06.680 --> 34:08.045
Abby?

34:11.880 --> 34:13.530
How long have you been here?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.764
Hello, Mr. Carlton.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.880
Who the hell are you?

34:29.480 --> 34:32.723
Hernando Cruz.
Surely you remember him.

34:33.520 --> 34:38.844
The young day trader you and
your colleagues framed and murdered.

34:39.239 --> 34:42.608
There were six of you pigs.

34:42.800 --> 34:46.964
Too good to work, too refined
and elegant to sweat.

34:47.320 --> 34:53.248
So you and all the other useless,
greedy pigs instead gorge yourselves...

34:53.480 --> 34:57.530
...grow fat on the sweat
of the other 99 percent.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.330
So...

35:01.800 --> 35:03.450
...little piggy...

35:04.880 --> 35:07.360
...I will tell you
how this is gonna work.

35:07.560 --> 35:10.131
You and Abby
have been having an affair.

35:10.320 --> 35:13.722
There's a digital paper trail
of texts and pictures.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.641
Your fingerprints and DNA
are in her apartment.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.845
You reserved this room.

35:19.040 --> 35:22.044
The police will believe
you've been to her apartment...

35:22.240 --> 35:24.447
...just like they'll believe
Abby discovered...

35:24.680 --> 35:26.967
...you were embezzling
from your firm...

35:27.160 --> 35:29.003
...and was gonna blackmail you...

35:29.200 --> 35:32.727
...unless you pay her to keep quiet.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.048
They'll confirm
she'd gone to a lawyer...

35:36.240 --> 35:38.163
...prepared a sexual-harassment lawsuit...

35:38.400 --> 35:41.882
...which she threatened you with,
so you shot her...

35:42.080 --> 35:44.048
...with the gun she bought...

35:44.280 --> 35:49.650
...to protect herself
before turning it on yourself.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.210
Abby...

35:55.640 --> 35:57.881
...she has such a big heart.

36:00.440 --> 36:06.083
She's so innocent, so unsuspecting.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.644
Just like...

36:13.840 --> 36:15.365
But this is the only way.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.642
You have to pay for what you did.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.881
Hey. I'm here. Sorry I'm late.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.570
What is this?

36:38.720 --> 36:40.245
Hello, this is security calling.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.647
I have a gentleman and a lady
from the FBI...

36:42.880 --> 36:44.803
...who'd like to speak with Mr. Carlton.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.128
I'm sorry, Abby.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.250
I'm so sorry.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.086
Follow me, please.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.648
Hands where I can see them.
Hands in the air!

37:23.280 --> 37:25.362
She said she made a mistake.

37:25.560 --> 37:28.450
She said she made a horrible mistake.

37:30.640 --> 37:34.008
Radio security! Have them lock down
the hotel! And call an ambulance!

37:59.240 --> 38:01.402
Ressler!

38:19.080 --> 38:20.127
You wanted to see me?

38:21.920 --> 38:24.048
I thought you should know.

38:24.280 --> 38:28.285
Mason Carlton's gonna be charged
in the murder of Hernando Cruz.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.801
We lost her.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.651
Yes. And we will find her.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.242
What matters now is that the innocent
people she framed are set free.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.608
This here...

38:49.240 --> 38:51.049
...and you there?

38:52.440 --> 38:54.807
You have no idea
how happy that makes me.

39:01.920 --> 39:05.003
- I wonder what his angle is.
- Sir?

39:05.200 --> 39:08.522
- Reddington. Why give us this case?
- Thank you.

39:08.720 --> 39:11.769
What's his interest
in this Cruz woman?

39:14.920 --> 39:17.844
Mrs. Cruz, my employer
is a longtime admirer of yours.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.048
- Who are you?
- He knows your gambit...

39:20.240 --> 39:22.561
...has run its course.
The FBI knows what you're up to.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.525
They're looking for you now.
You have one of two choices...

39:25.720 --> 39:28.371
...run and hide or accept his help.

39:29.520 --> 39:34.162
What help?
And who's this employer?

39:40.720 --> 39:42.688
I got your message.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.363
- What is this place?
- Reddington.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.889
Tom, what are you still doing here?

39:48.080 --> 39:51.721
I've been thinking about what you said
about needing to tell you the truth.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.527
- So I'll tell you the truth.
- I don't understand.

39:56.880 --> 40:01.920
The passports,
the passports came from Reddington.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.643
Liz, there's more.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.842
It's me. It's done.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.050
- I'm listening.
- The vote went your way.

40:15.240 --> 40:18.244
The Director wasn't very happy,
but a vote's a vote.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.410
- And Hobbs?
- He wants to meet.

40:21.640 --> 40:24.450
Yes, I'm quite sure he would have.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.927
- But he can't, can he?
- What do you mean?

40:27.120 --> 40:30.442
Hobbs was to contact me
after the vote was cast. He didn't.

40:30.640 --> 40:34.531
Which means he's dead, which means
you betrayed him, betrayed me.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.769
That's not true. He asked
that the three of us should meet...

40:37.960 --> 40:40.531
...so we can discuss the future.
- You need to run.

40:40.720 --> 40:43.690
Run like the prairie wind,
because I'm coming for you.

40:43.920 --> 40:46.844
When I find you, I'll cut out
that forked tongue of yours...

40:47.040 --> 40:49.725
...and deliver it to the Director myself.

40:55.640 --> 40:57.483
It's time to go away, Dembe.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.086
Agent Keen wants to meet regarding
the Fulcrum.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.924
- What's wrong?
- I just spent the last 42 hours...

41:12.120 --> 41:15.920
...dealing with a man who is
a lifelong habitual, pathological liar.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.447
- Tom.
- Yes. Tom.

41:18.640 --> 41:22.042
- Lizzy...
- Don't give me advice.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.722
This man, this liar...

41:26.280 --> 41:28.408
...he told me something.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.411
Something that I need you to confirm.

41:33.960 --> 41:38.761
Now, before I ask,
I want you to understand that...

41:39.960 --> 41:44.761
...I expect you to give me
the dignity of a yes or a no.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.166
Do you understand?

41:48.200 --> 41:50.009
Yes.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.368
I'm the one who hired Tom Keen
to enter your life.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.406
- Can I explain?
- No.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.329
No, you cannot explain.

42:04.200 --> 42:08.410
Here. This is all you wanted.
Now you have it.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.329
Lizzy, when I hired Tom...

42:10.520 --> 42:13.410
I said please do not attempt
to explain why.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.409
I don't care.
I just want this to stop.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.682
I want it all to stop, right now.

42:20.040 --> 42:23.169
- Take it!
- Lizzy. Lizzy.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.131
- No!
- Raymond!

42:29.280 --> 42:30.884
Dembe!

42:42.880 --> 42:44.803
Reddington!
