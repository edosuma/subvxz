14:27.433 --> 14:28.483
I am under attack!

14:29.016 --> 14:32.433
Dexter, in a tiny voice:
Mayday! Mayday! Zero-one-niner.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.283
Dexter: Mother?

14:46.316 --> 14:47.350
Mother?

14:47.383 --> 14:49.483
It is past
breakfast time.

14:50.016 --> 14:51.316
Mother: Ohh...

14:51.350 --> 14:52.166
Mom?

14:52.200 --> 14:54.066
What is this
strange condition?

Tongue is coated.
Pulse has quickened.

14:58.150 --> 15:00.316
What could be wrong?

15:01.300 --> 15:02.300
Mama's sick!

15:02.333 --> 15:05.100
You fool! Mothers
do not get sick.

15:05.133 --> 15:07.216
They take care
of the sickly.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.150
[Weakly]
I'm sorry, Dexter.

15:09.183 --> 15:10.350
I<i>a</i>

15:10.383 --> 15:12.333
you'll have to
feed yourself

15:12.366 --> 15:15.450
and keep the house
clean today.

15:15.483 --> 15:16.466
Cooking? Cleaning?

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
These are not things
a little boy knows how to do!

15:22.216 --> 15:26.250
Ok, Dexter.
You clean, and I'll cook.

15:26.283 --> 15:28.266
Yes. Heh heh.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.233
I'll clean.

15:30.266 --> 15:33.300
A simple task.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.266
Don't be skittish, Dexter.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.100
You can clean.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.350
Could this
strange phenomena

15:42.383 --> 15:45.183
be the substance

That sister of mine
tried to kill me!

15:58.083 --> 16:02.050
What exactly
are you making, Dee Dee?

16:02.083 --> 16:03.216
A pie.

16:03.250 --> 16:08.233
By any chance
that wouldn't be
a<i>poison pie</i>

16:08.266 --> 16:09.183
no.

16:09.216 --> 16:13.100
What is that white stuff
you are adding in?

16:13.133 --> 16:13.450
Flour.

16:13.483 --> 16:15.416
Aha! Flowers
are for smelling.

16:15.450 --> 16:18.250
They are not
for eating.

16:18.283 --> 16:19.450
Poison!

16:19.483 --> 16:22.116
Not poison--flour.

16:22.150 --> 16:25.133
Now go sit down
and let me finish.

16:42.283 --> 16:44.316
Light, flaky crust,

16:44.350 --> 16:45.333

16:45.366 --> 16:49.050
but I can't quite
place the flavor.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.400
Is it chocolate?

16:50.433 --> 16:52.050
No.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.116
No.

I give up.
What is it?

16:58.166 --> 16:59.083
Mud!

Oh! Mud. I would
have never guessed.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.250
Ah, ptooey!
Ptooey!

17:09.283 --> 17:12.016
That's no way to behave
while you are eating.

17:12.050 --> 17:15.150
I am done eating, and
you are done cooking.

17:15.183 --> 17:17.083
We are done dusting,
washing, drying.

17:17.116 --> 17:20.266
These things are
for a mother to do...

17:20.300 --> 17:24.000

Now, momdroid,
make me a peanut butter
and Bologna sandwich.

you clean your room.
