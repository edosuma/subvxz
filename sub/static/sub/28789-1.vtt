00:07.159 --> 00:10.409
(electric organ music)

00:19.760 --> 00:20.719
- Day one.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.640
Oh my God.

00:26.910 --> 00:29.010
This is gonna be an adventure.

00:29.010 --> 00:33.093
("Say Sumthin" by Dead End Kidz)

00:40.773 --> 00:41.773
Let's go!

00:59.082 --> 01:00.082
- Shakazuka!

01:32.440 --> 01:35.857
(cheering and whistling)

01:37.724 --> 01:41.807
("Say Sumthin" by Dead End Kidz)

02:46.983 --> 02:49.050
- I think when I first started to imagine

02:49.050 --> 02:50.740
what this tour could be,

02:50.740 --> 02:52.940
I honestly would have
to say it was this idea

02:52.940 --> 02:55.060
of promoting this pro-signature model shoe

02:55.060 --> 02:58.010
that we were releasing and
the idea originally was like,

02:58.010 --> 02:59.470
all right, let's just travel around

02:59.470 --> 03:01.210
with hundreds of shoes in the bus

03:01.210 --> 03:04.580
and just try to build
the culture of getting

03:04.580 --> 03:07.750
these athletes around the
world to buy the shoe.

03:07.750 --> 03:11.270
Unfortunately, but kind of
fortunately, we had a setback

03:11.270 --> 03:13.160
and we weren't happy with the product

03:13.160 --> 03:15.270
that we were making and
we kept wear testing

03:15.270 --> 03:17.500
and it pushed us so far
that we didn't have shoes

03:17.500 --> 03:18.950
ready for the tour.

03:18.950 --> 03:20.760
With that being said, I had already set up

03:20.760 --> 03:24.280
17 events around the USA
and I wanted to continue

03:24.280 --> 03:25.260
to keep that momentum.

03:25.260 --> 03:26.210
I didn't want to push it back,

03:26.210 --> 03:27.210
I didn't want to cancel anything.

03:27.210 --> 03:30.950
So, the next best thing and
actually the real best thing

03:30.950 --> 03:32.940
was just using it,

03:32.940 --> 03:34.772
using it as a way to build a community

03:34.772 --> 03:36.850
and connect with people that maybe

03:36.850 --> 03:38.990
I never really had a chance
to connect with before.

03:38.990 --> 03:43.220
Right now we are picking up Marcus Zyrken!

03:43.220 --> 03:45.620
Marcus, always filming,
you're always filming.

03:45.620 --> 03:48.596
And Doctor Richard Ferreday.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.946
I thought you guys said
you were getting water.

03:52.990 --> 03:54.370
It's day one of the Lace Up Tour,

03:54.370 --> 03:56.030
we're heading to the tour bus right now,

03:56.030 --> 03:58.120
we've got all our stuff packed.

03:58.120 --> 04:01.300
And we're about to get
on the road for 63 days.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.300
Let's go.

04:03.065 --> 04:07.148
("Say Sumthin" by Dead End Kidz)

04:15.740 --> 04:17.161
Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

04:17.161 --> 04:19.300
- It's Sydney Olson!
- Whooh, hi!

04:19.300 --> 04:20.370
My name is Sydney Olson.

04:20.370 --> 04:22.130
I'm originally from Seattle, Washington,

04:22.130 --> 04:23.420
but I live in Los Angeles.

04:23.420 --> 04:26.094
I'm 25 years old, and I'm
a professional free runner.

04:26.094 --> 04:27.370
- You ready for this?

04:27.370 --> 04:28.710
- Yes! (laughs)

04:28.710 --> 04:31.505
- That did not sound very confident.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.505
There he is!

04:36.210 --> 04:38.105
- My name is Jeff Garrido.

04:38.105 --> 04:40.080
I'm 23 years old,

04:40.080 --> 04:42.823
from Folsom, California,
which is like Sacramento.

04:42.823 --> 04:44.350
That's it, baby. (laughs)

04:44.350 --> 04:46.260
- Two more people joining us,

04:46.260 --> 04:48.654
Robert Kirkland, our physio.

04:48.654 --> 04:49.487
Hey!
- Hey!

04:50.774 --> 04:51.607
- You ready to do this?

04:51.607 --> 04:52.440
- No.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.350
- Let's do it.
- No.

04:53.350 --> 04:54.183
- George!

04:55.244 --> 04:56.077
- What's up, man?

04:56.077 --> 04:57.193
- Thanks dude.

04:57.193 --> 04:58.433
- Welcome back.

05:00.184 --> 05:01.440
("Say Sumthin" by Dead End Kidz)

05:01.440 --> 05:03.603
Almost ready to hit the road, baby.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.500
We now had two goals for the tour,

05:08.500 --> 05:10.950
post events that bring
communities together

05:10.950 --> 05:12.453
and make a really dope film.

05:13.364 --> 05:15.100
But it was almost like
the film and the tour

05:15.100 --> 05:16.770
were two different things,

05:16.770 --> 05:18.480
and one of the goals of
the film was to shoot

05:18.480 --> 05:21.460
in unique locations all around the U.S.

05:21.460 --> 05:23.410
no matter how hard they were to get to.

05:24.570 --> 05:26.764
Right now, we're trying to head to a

05:26.764 --> 05:29.683
abandoned ghost town
from the Gold Rush era.

05:30.540 --> 05:33.030
But the road is a little rough.

05:33.030 --> 05:34.210
Woo!
("Wet" by Siryogaflame)

05:34.210 --> 05:36.470
- [Narrator] I really don't
know what I expected to see

05:36.470 --> 05:38.013
when I came to Bodie.

05:39.765 --> 05:42.765
Just a lot of old houses, I suppose.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.357
Well, Bodie had 'em.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.190
Some were standing, but leaning.

05:54.756 --> 05:57.756
Some were leaning a little bit more.

06:06.430 --> 06:08.116
The caretakers had the planters,

06:08.116 --> 06:11.650
and their bosses got on very
well, all things considered.

06:23.113 --> 06:25.200
That was one of the last automobiles

06:25.200 --> 06:27.125
that had any call for it.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.953
It kind of gives you an idea.

06:32.883 --> 06:36.857
Like all mining towns, Bodie
has had a lot of fires.

06:42.517 --> 06:45.023
That's the machine they
used to fight the fire.

06:47.285 --> 06:49.085
- And that's like my favorite
part about going out to these

06:49.085 --> 06:51.950
different locations, is that

06:51.950 --> 06:54.180
this obstacle is nothing
that any of us has ever

06:54.180 --> 06:55.960
been able to try to train on.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.245
So it lends itself to, like,

06:57.245 --> 06:59.245
a little bit more of a creative process.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.090
- [Narrator] It's still
shiny and new looking.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.850
Maybe that's because
of the work out it got.

07:08.605 --> 07:11.938
("Wet" by Siryogaflame)

07:13.725 --> 07:16.223
They didn't have any
mining disasters in Bodie,

07:17.210 --> 07:19.827
no cave-ins or anything like that.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.957
No, I really can't say
what I expected to find

07:25.957 --> 07:27.696
in a ghost town.

07:27.696 --> 07:29.917
But certainly not people.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.834
- [Jesse] Yo, we got a park ranger.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.293
- [Marcus] What just happened?

07:51.293 --> 07:55.373
- We just got a citation for
filming without a permit.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.273
Kind of cool, I don't know how
much it's gonna cost, $1,000?

07:59.273 --> 08:01.509
500, 5, 50, 500?

08:01.509 --> 08:02.997
Who knows?

08:02.997 --> 08:04.407
Let's get the (ching) out of here.

08:04.407 --> 08:09.407
- [Marcus] What was that? (Sydney laughs)

08:10.720 --> 08:12.500
- Literally, where are we?

08:12.500 --> 08:14.223
- Apple's Lake?
- Apple's Lake?

08:15.380 --> 08:17.377
There's a big old lake right there,

08:17.377 --> 08:18.210
and a bunch of mountains.

08:18.210 --> 08:20.196
There's snow around us.

08:20.196 --> 08:22.760
- S'no way. (laughs)

08:22.760 --> 08:25.190
- What's crazy to me is
that I've been working

08:25.190 --> 08:27.280
on this for a year and a half.

08:27.280 --> 08:31.700
Dream of having a full tour
bus, bunk beds and everything

08:31.700 --> 08:34.419
and like seeing it in
locations like this one

08:34.419 --> 08:36.020
is, like, sort of surreal.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.380
And every time I look
back as we're walking away

08:38.380 --> 08:40.330
from the bus, it's like this moment of,

08:41.284 --> 08:43.885
(scoffs) It feels good, so
I'm gonna take a picture.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.670
One of the ways in which we decided

08:47.670 --> 08:48.990
to keep the tour stress-free

08:48.990 --> 08:51.090
was just to go with the flow.

08:51.090 --> 08:54.353
So, that night we all
decided to get tattoos.

08:54.353 --> 08:56.520
(buzzing)

08:59.030 --> 09:00.340
We did it!

09:00.340 --> 09:01.460
- Good stuff.
- I'm freaking out.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.000
- I'm freaking out.
- It's just a tattoo.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.930
- I'm now freaking out.
- It's your first tattoo,

09:04.930 --> 09:06.160
it's fine.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.210
It might not come out good.

09:07.210 --> 09:08.123
It doesn't matter.

09:09.113 --> 09:13.140
It's not like it's almost midnight.

09:13.140 --> 09:14.233
Got his first tattoo.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.970
After a late night getting tattoos

09:18.970 --> 09:20.680
we all enjoyed an incredible meal

09:20.680 --> 09:22.690
prepared by Jeff's family before heading

09:22.690 --> 09:24.760
to our next location,

09:24.760 --> 09:26.053
Woodward, Tahoe.

("Don't Leave Yet" by Yung Koolade)

09:26.886 --> 09:27.747

- Hi.

09:29.590 --> 09:30.530
- My name's Jesse La Flair,

09:30.530 --> 09:33.217
we're here with the Lace Up
Tour for the Parkour Week.

09:33.217 --> 09:34.800
Okay perfect.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.800
Woodward, the largest action
sports camp in the world

09:47.800 --> 09:49.760
invited us out to go train and shoot

09:49.760 --> 09:52.310
at each one of their
locations while on tour.

09:52.310 --> 09:54.360
And we couldn't pass up this opportunity.

09:55.460 --> 09:58.263
This is also where our
pro roster began to grow.

09:59.450 --> 10:00.513
Erik's here!

Originally I was born in Uzbekistan,

10:09.340 --> 10:10.390
and then I moved Russia

10:10.390 --> 10:13.313
and I lived there for about
10 years or something.

10:16.900 --> 10:20.224
- Just to have fun, be
with all my friends.

10:20.224 --> 10:22.886
- Hey!
- Oh, I'm so glad, man.

10:22.886 --> 10:24.997
- Poor guy.
- I finally made it.

10:24.997 --> 10:28.153
- Nothin' like sitting at
airport for three hours waiting.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.500
All right, this is my first
time here at Woodward, Tahoe.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.480
And there are so many cool features.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.653
Like, look at this.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.220
What is going on?

10:41.220 --> 10:43.500
They just put in new rails.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.163
This bar set up is so sick.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.833
- [Marcus] What?

10:48.220 --> 10:50.530
- Dude, I am really excited about this.

10:50.530 --> 10:54.470
This is the type of spot that
inspires me to try to, like,

10:54.470 --> 10:57.430
explore some really interesting
lines and use the space

10:57.430 --> 10:59.935
in a way that I couldn't
do somewhere else.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.470
- So far, the training has been amazing.

13:30.470 --> 13:33.150
Training with the guys has been great.

13:33.150 --> 13:34.980
I'm definitely pushing
myself, while being pushed

13:34.980 --> 13:37.170
by everybody else, and that's
just a great combination

in my book.

13:38.390 --> 13:42.276
to do anything else, unless
you get this move right.

- That's what I was afraid of.

13:48.211 --> 13:49.680
- I think I can make it, though.

- [Marcus] I think you can make it, dude.

13:53.147 --> 13:55.450
- [Onlookers] Yeah!

13:55.450 --> 13:56.283
- Yep.
- No!

13:58.448 --> 13:59.700
- That was close.
- That was so much better,

I couldn't land it!

- Oh!

- No!

Dude, I got so freaked out!

14:14.770 --> 14:16.620
I kicked the tree a lot that time.

14:16.620 --> 14:17.820
Did you see that, just, this twist?

14:17.820 --> 14:19.570
- [Jesse] Yeah, that was, you were, oh!

14:19.570 --> 14:21.360
That was like a uh-oh-twist.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.883
- Good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:24.494 --> 14:25.327
Yeah, man.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.004
- [Marcus] Are we doing something else?

14:28.004 --> 14:29.200
- That's what's so great about it, is that

14:29.200 --> 14:31.150
we're here together, and
we're pushing each other.

14:31.150 --> 14:34.620
So, when I get people like
Erik Mukhametshin in here,

14:34.620 --> 14:37.150
teaching me new moves, it's quite a,

14:37.150 --> 14:39.410
it's actually kind of a scary
feeling for me. (laughs)

14:39.410 --> 14:41.390
I have to learn to work past it, but

14:41.390 --> 14:43.400
just the idea that someone
believes in me that much,

14:43.400 --> 14:44.510
it makes me want to work harder.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.870
'Cause he'll tell me
to do something, and I,

14:46.870 --> 14:48.330
I'm like, ah, I don't
know if I can do that.

14:48.330 --> 14:49.890
But then I work on it and I try it,

14:49.890 --> 14:51.240
and eventually I'll get it.

14:52.550 --> 14:55.020
- Never worn a thong?
- No! (laughter)

14:55.020 --> 14:56.239
- [Sydney] You don't
have to only wear that,

14:56.239 --> 14:58.800
you can still wear your pants. (laughter)

14:58.800 --> 15:01.040
- [Jesse] Yeah, you get to
wear pants over it. (laughter)

15:01.040 --> 15:02.790
- For how long?
- Four hours.

15:02.790 --> 15:04.096
- Four hours?

15:04.096 --> 15:05.860
Um, I really don't want to do it,

15:05.860 --> 15:09.197
one and 10. (laughter)

15:09.197 --> 15:10.746
- Ready?
- No, I'm ready, all right.

15:10.746 --> 15:11.579
- Here we go,

15:11.579 --> 15:12.412
- Three, two, one,
- three, two, one--

15:12.412 --> 15:13.245
- [Jesse Voiceover]
While playing the odds,

15:13.245 --> 15:15.950
if you guess the same number
as someone who just odds'd you,

15:15.950 --> 15:17.585
you have to do that dare.

15:17.585 --> 15:18.418
- Eight.
- 10.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.650
- [Onlookers] Oh!

15:19.650 --> 15:20.730
- [Jesse Voiceover] I'm only
telling you this because

15:20.730 --> 15:22.560
odds are, you're going
to see us play a lot

15:22.560 --> 15:23.610
throughout this film.

15:29.860 --> 15:31.733
So last night got a little crazy.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.721
None of it got filmed.

15:34.721 --> 15:37.521
(laughter)

15:37.521 --> 15:39.052
- [Sydney] Oh my gosh!

15:39.052 --> 15:40.961
(yelling)

15:40.961 --> 15:42.590
(groaning)

15:42.590 --> 15:44.553
- But it's okay, it's better that way.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.140
We're doing a hot-swap.

15:47.140 --> 15:47.973
No stopping.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.060
All right.

15:51.060 --> 15:53.750
Don't bump the wheel, whatever you do.

15:53.750 --> 15:54.583
Yeah.

15:56.784 --> 16:00.117
(cheering and laughter)

16:05.991 --> 16:07.741
We are in an RV park.

16:08.820 --> 16:10.510
I guess tomorrow morning
we going to wake up

16:10.510 --> 16:12.210
in front of a beautiful lake.

16:12.210 --> 16:14.440
We passed a bridge that we
think we saw a rope swing on,

16:14.440 --> 16:16.356
so you guys can--

16:16.356 --> 16:19.023
(eerie chiming)

16:25.460 --> 16:27.790
- I think some of my
favorite moments of the tour

16:27.790 --> 16:30.360
were just the adventures that would unfold

16:30.360 --> 16:32.843
from the openness of, like,

16:33.750 --> 16:38.750
pulling over, or just not
having such a solid plan

16:38.870 --> 16:41.883
that we blocked something magical.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.130
All right, so we found a bridge

16:46.130 --> 16:48.130
right as the sun was going down yesterday,

16:48.130 --> 16:50.090
as we drove into this place.

16:50.090 --> 16:51.970
And someone thought they saw a rope.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.570
So we're going to go see
if we can rope-swing it.

16:54.570 --> 16:56.941
Otherwise we'll shoot some
video on the bridge itself,

16:56.941 --> 16:58.710
because it looked pretty cool.

16:58.710 --> 16:59.543
Sick.

17:03.541 --> 17:06.152
(nervous laughter)

17:06.152 --> 17:09.484
("Wet" by Siryogaflame)

17:34.360 --> 17:35.527
- [Erik] Whee!

18:03.110 --> 18:06.070
- [Jesse] You nailed
that one, bro. (laughter)

18:28.040 --> 18:31.650
(cheering and clapping)

18:31.650 --> 18:32.700
This worked out, huh?

18:35.017 --> 18:37.480
"Hey, let's try to sleep over by the dam."

18:37.480 --> 18:38.717
No, that didn't work.

18:38.717 --> 18:40.257
"Oh, let's drive 20 more minutes, there,

18:40.257 --> 18:41.970
"it looks like there might be an RV park."

18:41.970 --> 18:43.757
Well, that didn't exist.

18:43.757 --> 18:44.907
"Hey, let's park here for the night.

18:44.907 --> 18:46.599
"Oh, look at that bridge!"

18:46.599 --> 18:49.400
(laughs) That's, like,
the journey we're on,

18:49.400 --> 18:52.823
randomly getting cool shit to
happen while we're doin' this.

18:54.750 --> 18:59.290
My two standouts has gotta
be Erik and Sydney, I think.

18:59.290 --> 19:02.920
Erik's someone who always
comes off as this kind of cocky

19:04.030 --> 19:05.960
bastard. (laughs)

19:05.960 --> 19:09.360
But he can always back up
what he's being cocky about.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.680
He'll say, "I'm going to do this,"

19:10.680 --> 19:12.780
and he literally always does it.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.810
Next shot, we're going
to drive the tour bus

19:15.810 --> 19:17.270
over that bridge,

19:17.270 --> 19:19.060
and Erik's gonna jump while it's moving

19:19.060 --> 19:20.610
off the top and into the water.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.464
- Yeah, let's go.
- Here we go!

19:57.550 --> 19:59.626
- Oh my God, he wiped out!
- What?

19:59.626 --> 20:02.543
(muffled bubbling)

20:08.082 --> 20:09.665
- Yo!
- Yo, get him!

20:14.198 --> 20:15.615
Help, help, help!

20:18.391 --> 20:20.724

20:23.810 --> 20:27.227
(tense electronic music)

20:29.549 --> 20:30.580
- Ooh!
- Come in.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.847
- Sounds like a solid head hit.

20:34.155 --> 20:36.639
- [Erik] Little, little
concussion, probably.

20:36.639 --> 20:38.310
- Whooh!
- Oh yeah.

20:38.310 --> 20:41.850
- At that point, we were
only 12 days into the tour

20:41.850 --> 20:43.390
out of 63, so,

20:43.390 --> 20:45.963
for something to happen
that early on was kinda,

20:46.900 --> 20:49.670
was kind of crazy, but if
anyone could've taken that hit

20:49.670 --> 20:53.713
and walked away from it
essentially, it was definitely Erik.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.150
- Don't remember anything,
that's so annoying.

20:57.150 --> 20:59.640
- [Jesse] This was the first
time on tour where we realized,

20:59.640 --> 21:02.670
when things go wrong, it
happens extremely fast

21:02.670 --> 21:04.340
and with no warning.

21:04.340 --> 21:06.270
But we had to get back on the road,

21:06.270 --> 21:07.870
we had a whole tour ahead of us.

21:29.338 --> 21:32.005

21:35.778 --> 21:37.177

21:37.177 --> 21:38.510
- [Sydney] Geez!

21:44.367 --> 21:49.367
(Jesse screams)
(laughter)

21:49.850 --> 21:51.040
- My name is Nate Weston.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.490
I am 21 years old.

21:52.490 --> 21:54.190
I am from Seattle, Washington,

21:54.190 --> 21:57.660
and I've been training parkour
for just under six years.

21:57.660 --> 22:00.250
What initially attracted
me to the sport is

22:00.250 --> 22:03.070
how free it is, and how you
can really express yourself

22:03.070 --> 22:05.220
through movement, and there's
no real boundaries at all,

22:05.220 --> 22:08.530
there's nothing you need to
do, or need to buy or anything,

22:08.530 --> 22:10.570
and you can just train whenever you want,

22:10.570 --> 22:13.100
and I think that's just
the most amazing part

22:13.100 --> 22:15.913
about training, is being able
to do it whenever you want.

22:15.913 --> 22:18.750
Dude, you've outdone
yourself, this is so nice!

22:18.750 --> 22:20.430
- He's so excited for odds, right now,

22:20.430 --> 22:22.451
that he just--
- No! (laughter)

22:22.451 --> 22:24.103
- Ask Jeff all about it.
- Let's just say, Nate,

22:24.103 --> 22:26.572
I did not have a good
week, man. (laughter)

22:26.572 --> 22:28.972
- I've been seeing some
gnarly stuff goin' down.

22:30.447 --> 22:32.010
- Welcome to tour!

22:32.010 --> 22:33.411
Look!

22:33.411 --> 22:35.200
It's Joey!
- Whaddup!

22:35.200 --> 22:37.360
- Joey, you're our first VIP!
- Oh my God!

22:37.360 --> 22:38.490
(laughter)

22:38.490 --> 22:39.690
- My name's Joey Adrian.

22:39.690 --> 22:42.170
I've been training for about nine years,

22:42.170 --> 22:43.780
maybe a little less, maybe a little more,

22:43.780 --> 22:45.340
and I'm from Portland, Oregon.

22:45.340 --> 22:47.940
The thing that really
brought me into parkour

22:47.940 --> 22:51.010
and, like, solidified that
this is what I wanted to do,

22:51.010 --> 22:53.350
is this was the first
thing where I felt that

22:53.350 --> 22:56.140
I can get good at whatever I
want, if I just practice it.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.590
And that was the first thing
that I realized that for,

22:58.590 --> 23:00.480
so I just, like, ran with it.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.380
It's pretty lit!
- Are you going with them

23:01.380 --> 23:03.030
on tour?
- You wanna have me on

23:03.030 --> 23:04.580
for a little bit?
- You want to just jump on--

23:04.580 --> 23:06.900
- Dude!
- Are you coming with us?

23:06.900 --> 23:10.120
- Yeah! (loud cheering)

23:10.120 --> 23:12.523
- That's how it happens!
- That's how it goes, man.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.620
- Where are we at?
- We

23:17.620 --> 23:18.937
are at the zoo in Portland,

23:18.937 --> 23:21.980
and we just parked the
tour bus, and apparently,

23:21.980 --> 23:25.023
it's so big that I need
to pay for five spots.

23:26.180 --> 23:28.210
But the machine's not working.

23:28.210 --> 23:29.640
- Stoked, man!

23:29.640 --> 23:32.038
It's also just exciting to
have everybody, you know,

23:32.038 --> 23:32.871
in Portland, at the spot--
- at the spot (laughs)

23:32.871 --> 23:34.380
where you're training.
- Yeah, exactly.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.480
- That's cool
- 'Cause that doesn't ever,

- Whooh!

24:40.608 --> 24:41.441
- [Erik] At some point I thought

24:41.441 --> 24:43.108
I'm not going to rotate enough,

24:43.108 --> 24:45.915
I was like, "I'm screwed."
- Oh my God!

24:45.915 --> 24:47.030

24:47.030 --> 24:49.137
- That was disgusting.

25:47.007 --> 25:49.209
- [Erik] Oh my God!

25:49.209 --> 25:52.459
Maybe there's some more.
- Mm mm, mm mm.

25:53.699 --> 25:56.689

I'm going to throw up.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.923
("Hollows" by The Seasons)

26:13.923 --> 26:17.630
- I mean, there's very
few people out there that

26:17.630 --> 26:20.750
can get a tour bus and
tour around the country,

26:20.750 --> 26:23.690
for all summer, that's pretty insane.

26:23.690 --> 26:26.470
And he had a very powerful voice as well.

26:26.470 --> 26:29.270
And I'm really, really
thankful for what he's doing

26:29.270 --> 26:31.120
with this whole tour,
because it's just showing

26:31.120 --> 26:33.570
that there's so much more
you can do with movement,

26:33.570 --> 26:36.270
and there's so many lives
you can affect through this

26:36.270 --> 26:39.360
simple sport, and I think
it's super empowering.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.200
- I didn't know, basically, anything

26:41.200 --> 26:44.410
about how this tour was
getting set up or anything.

26:44.410 --> 26:46.510
And then, talking with Jesse, knowing that

26:47.380 --> 26:50.450
he's basically fronting
all the money for this,

26:50.450 --> 26:54.120
realizing that our first gas stop,

26:54.120 --> 26:57.400
it was like 200-and-some
dollars to fill it up.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.700
And I was just like, wait,

26:59.800 --> 27:00.640
what?

27:00.640 --> 27:05.640
You're paying 200 plus dollars
every time we stop for gas,

27:05.640 --> 27:08.580
just so that you can
spread these good vibes

27:08.580 --> 27:12.030
and bring these high-level
athletes to these communities.

27:12.030 --> 27:15.340
Because the movement's one
thing, but that only goes so far.

27:15.340 --> 27:17.100
We already have insane athletes,

27:17.100 --> 27:19.430
but we don't have a lot of
people that are going out

27:19.430 --> 27:22.510
and actually making opportunities happen.

27:22.510 --> 27:26.083
So, seeing Jesse do that has
been massively inspiring to me.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.110
- [Jesse] None of us had ever seen

27:30.110 --> 27:32.070
Mount Rushmore in person before.

27:32.070 --> 27:33.930
So we all decided it would be a dope place

27:33.930 --> 27:35.563
to go and get some cool shots.

27:36.550 --> 27:37.383
- [Navigation App] Starting route to

27:39.306 --> 27:42.056
("Give" by Oboy)

28:37.277 --> 28:39.520
- We could feel that we were
causing too much attention,

28:39.520 --> 28:41.997
and decided it was time to leave.

28:41.997 --> 28:43.550
But right when we thought it was safe,

28:43.550 --> 28:45.110

the interpersonal dynamic

28:57.920 --> 28:59.293
between you three.

28:59.293 --> 29:01.070
You became kind of like the
Three Musketeers, in a way.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.610
- I know, it's crazy.

29:03.610 --> 29:05.280
- [Marcus] Have you grown
as friends, do you think?

29:05.280 --> 29:07.510
- Oh yeah, for sure, I've known Joey for

29:07.510 --> 29:09.450
just about as long as I've been training,

29:09.450 --> 29:11.300
because he lives in Portland
and I live in Seattle.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.250
When I first started
training, he was literally

29:13.250 --> 29:15.870
one of the first famous or
professional parkour athletes

29:15.870 --> 29:17.940
that I knew at the time,
I'm like, "Oh, that's Joey!"

29:17.940 --> 29:20.440
and when I met him, it was
just such a crazy thing,

29:20.440 --> 29:22.280
because he just was a regular dude,

29:22.280 --> 29:25.170
and I was just this kid
kinda looking up to him.

29:25.170 --> 29:27.700
And to be able to be
training with him now,

29:27.700 --> 29:29.470
as well as with Erik,

29:29.470 --> 29:31.460
to be able to be training with them,

29:31.460 --> 29:34.530
and at a similar level, and
just having a good old time,

29:34.530 --> 29:37.120
and being friends, has
been really, really fun.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.740
And I definitely got to know
Erik a lot more this trip,

29:39.740 --> 29:41.390
which has been really a blessing as well,

29:41.390 --> 29:43.050
because he was one of the first people

29:43.050 --> 29:44.650
I really watched and studied.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.229
Three, two, one, one!
- Two, one, one!

29:46.229 --> 29:48.220
(laughter)

29:48.220 --> 29:51.670
- Nate has to take a
picture of the waitress,

29:51.670 --> 29:54.053
but with the flash on,
and it takes forever.

29:57.744 --> 29:58.577
(Nate clears throat)

29:58.577 --> 30:00.660
- Whoa!
- Sorry. (laughter)

30:00.660 --> 30:02.030
- [Jesse] Thank you very much.

30:03.814 --> 30:08.814
- Get that for ya. (mischievous laughter)

30:09.648 --> 30:11.760
- Whaddup!
- What's up!

30:11.760 --> 30:13.490
- I'm Mich Todorovic.

30:13.490 --> 30:15.150
I'm from Montreal, Canada,

30:15.150 --> 30:18.107
and I've been doing parkour for 14 years.

30:18.107 --> 30:20.272
- [Erik] Todorovik's ready now, too, so

30:20.272 --> 30:21.496
it doesn't matter, right?

30:21.496 --> 30:23.373
Hey bro.
- How's it going, man?

30:23.373 --> 30:26.440
I mean, I was always a super active kid,

30:26.440 --> 30:28.510
when I was young, and basically,

30:28.510 --> 30:32.250
I couldn't afford to
play all the team sport.

30:32.250 --> 30:35.103
I kind of sacrificed school for parkour.

30:36.106 --> 30:37.770
At some point, I was like, you know what?

30:37.770 --> 30:41.980
I have no idea why I want
to keep going to school,

30:41.980 --> 30:43.620
if I don't know what I want to do.

30:43.620 --> 30:47.720
And I knew that parkour was my main focus.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.040
So I said, you know what?

30:49.040 --> 30:50.380
I'm gonna drop school.

30:50.380 --> 30:52.430
I'm going to do parkour is much as I can.

30:58.170 --> 31:00.760
- [Jesse] With Mich now on
board, we drove off to a spot

31:00.760 --> 31:02.463
that we'd all been waiting for.

31:06.013 --> 31:07.463
- Where do you want to start?

31:08.680 --> 31:10.609
- [Nate] This park's insane.

31:10.609 --> 31:13.104
It's almost, like, too much to do.

31:13.104 --> 31:14.595
I don't know, what do
you want to start with?

31:14.595 --> 31:16.036
- [Joey] There's a hella
glass on this ground, so--

31:16.036 --> 31:19.184
- Yeah, I know, there was
hell a glass over there too.

("Invincible" by P3RRY)

31:33.770 --> 31:36.100
- [Jesse] Today's shoot location
is called Grand Fountain

31:36.100 --> 31:38.040
here in Flint, Michigan.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.460
It's easily one of the best
spots not only in the USA,

31:41.460 --> 31:43.780
but in the entire world.

31:43.780 --> 31:45.560
I guarantee you that today

31:45.560 --> 31:47.128
it goes down.

- Yeah.

33:45.827 --> 33:47.261
- [Jesse] He's chillin'.

33:47.261 --> 33:48.872
Sit down. (laughs)

33:48.872 --> 33:49.705
Be gimbal!

33:58.832 --> 34:01.415
That was so, how did you do it?

34:24.500 --> 34:25.400
- [Joey] Let's go!

34:30.080 --> 34:31.929
- [Jesse] Mich can do magical things.

34:37.130 --> 34:39.010
(laughter)

34:39.010 --> 34:40.870
After that pretty intense film day,

34:40.870 --> 34:43.659
we all decided that some
relaxation was in order.

34:43.659 --> 34:46.050
So we drove off to
Caesar Creek Lake in Ohio

34:46.050 --> 34:47.223
to spend the night.

35:16.203 --> 35:17.365

35:17.365 --> 35:21.326
Turn around. (laughter)

- Three, two, one.

35:47.454 --> 35:48.873
- [Erik] Oh my God!

35:48.873 --> 35:50.523
- One and five.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.670
Who's going to go first?

35:51.670 --> 35:53.300
Loser has to take some of that mud,

35:53.300 --> 35:54.933
and stick it in their mouth.

35:56.865 --> 35:59.170
(laughs) You first, right?
- Mmm, no.

35:59.170 --> 36:00.313
- Three, two, one,

36:00.313 --> 36:03.886
two!
- Two! (yelling)

36:03.886 --> 36:05.948
- Ya done!
- Yes, Jesse!

36:05.948 --> 36:07.115
- Yes!
- Oh my,

36:08.658 --> 36:10.260
- There it is.
- Yes, show us.

36:17.107 --> 36:21.940

(laughter)

36:24.268 --> 36:27.943
- [Erik] Oh my God, put
your mouth in the water!

36:27.943 --> 36:30.950
- [Jesse] It's still on
your tongue, we can see it!

36:30.950 --> 36:33.337
- [Erik] Oh my God! (laughter)

36:36.273 --> 36:37.970
- So I love free-running
more than anything

36:37.970 --> 36:38.960
in the entire world.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.210
It's brought me to places
that I never would've expected

36:41.210 --> 36:42.043
that I'd get to go.

36:42.043 --> 36:43.560
And I've gotten to travel

36:43.560 --> 36:45.470
to so many different places in the world,

36:45.470 --> 36:48.190
and I've met so many
amazing people through this.

36:48.190 --> 36:50.440
Being on tour has been
the most fun I've ever had

36:50.440 --> 36:51.500
in my entire life.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.500
And it's not necessarily
just the training.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.020
It's the friendship, and it's
the going out in the water

36:56.020 --> 36:57.740
and throwing mud at each other,

36:57.740 --> 37:00.150
constantly playing the
odds game with each other,

37:00.150 --> 37:02.580
and doing some really
dumb stuff because of it.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.877
It really has been such
an amazing adventure.

("OHM" by Dead End Kidz)

37:41.380 --> 37:43.080
- On the outskirts of Chicago,

37:43.080 --> 37:46.270
we found there was this
abandoned mill or something.

37:46.270 --> 37:48.730
Got graffiti all over it, we
did see some security in there,

37:48.730 --> 37:50.480
and signs that say no trespassing.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.560
But at this point, we
are going to try to go in

37:52.560 --> 37:54.440
and scout it, and see what happens.

So, fingers crossed.

Hoping to get off some shots
before we get kicked out.

- Rolling!

38:55.890 --> 38:56.723
- [Onlookers] Yes!

39:10.340 --> 39:13.300
- I actually got a pretty
bad nail stuck in my bone,

39:13.300 --> 39:15.490
I couldn't get it out of
there, it was so stuck,

39:15.490 --> 39:16.840
so I just,

39:16.840 --> 39:18.650
how did I not see it?
- Ah!

39:23.820 --> 39:25.927
- Oh, there's security, we gotta go.

39:27.230 --> 39:29.480
He told us to leave, I don't
think he called the cops.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.310
But I'm not going to celebrate,

39:31.310 --> 39:33.620
until we get back to the bus!

39:33.620 --> 39:34.453
Fingers crossed.

- What was that?

39:56.250 --> 40:00.220

40:00.220 --> 40:02.350
- Something weird, it's
really hard to explain,

40:02.350 --> 40:04.670
it should be something really different

40:04.670 --> 40:06.150
to all the things that I've already done.

40:06.150 --> 40:07.960
It's hard to explain, I don't know.

40:07.960 --> 40:11.150
Let's say there are two
walls next to each other,

40:11.150 --> 40:12.590
with a good distance, but I could

40:12.590 --> 40:15.190
cut 180 to a front flip
or something like that,

40:15.190 --> 40:17.280
like some weird stuff.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.060
It's just hard, like, most of the time,

40:19.060 --> 40:20.520
I'm just finding something really weird,

40:20.520 --> 40:23.260
and I'm like, "Whoa, I
wonder if that will work?"

40:23.260 --> 40:25.673
And I'll just spend, like,
a couple of hours trying it.

42:45.890 --> 42:47.310

42:47.310 --> 42:49.780
and I'm from Los Angeles, California.

42:49.780 --> 42:53.700
I started off as a student
and now I'm a pro free runner.

42:53.700 --> 42:55.480
Well, the reason I wanted
to come on this tour

42:55.480 --> 42:57.450
is because, obviously,
it's parkour free running,

42:57.450 --> 42:59.830
which is, like, one of
my favorite things to do.

42:59.830 --> 43:01.580
But also, all the stops
that you're going to

43:01.580 --> 43:04.460
are places that I've wanted to
do before I even did parkour,

43:04.460 --> 43:06.710
like Woodward, I've seen
that since I was a kid,

43:06.710 --> 43:08.300
so it's kind of been on this pedestal,

43:08.300 --> 43:10.430
I never thought that I would
ever actually be there,

43:10.430 --> 43:12.270
but now the idea of coming as a pro

43:12.270 --> 43:14.509
is a really cool thing to me.

43:14.509 --> 43:18.592
("Say Sumthin" by Dead End Kidz)

43:27.020 --> 43:28.060
- Dude!

43:28.060 --> 43:31.170
Jesse's one of the sickest
cameramen I've ever seen.

43:31.170 --> 43:33.730
The first time I saw
Jesse bust out the Red

43:33.730 --> 43:35.770
and film one of my lines,

43:35.770 --> 43:37.897
I was just expecting to be like, "Oh look,

43:37.897 --> 43:40.910
"I can see the line, it's
on a nice camera, cool."

43:40.910 --> 43:44.260
But no, he gets every
single angle perfect!

43:44.260 --> 43:47.580
He's in the exact right spot
so that he's not in my way.

43:47.580 --> 43:49.860
He's filming the exact thing

43:49.860 --> 43:52.220
that you need to see in the movement.

43:52.220 --> 43:55.690
And that's not something
that it's easy to do.

43:55.690 --> 43:58.500
And then seeing him film,
like, Erik do a line,

43:58.500 --> 44:01.280
or Nate do a line, or Sydney do a line,

44:01.280 --> 44:04.310
Jesse somehow has this super tight view,

44:04.310 --> 44:07.290
but doesn't miss anything
in the whole picture.

44:07.290 --> 44:08.540
And it's been incredible.

44:11.765 --> 44:14.184
(laughter)

44:14.184 --> 44:16.563
I knew there was something
because I saw George filming.

44:20.710 --> 44:24.620
- [Onlookers] Oh! (burst of laughter)

44:24.620 --> 44:27.440
- I believe it's in my DNA. (laughs)

44:27.440 --> 44:30.750
I love to challenge myself, I love to,

44:30.750 --> 44:32.500
to be the best me I can.

44:32.500 --> 44:35.130
And I was like that in soccer,

44:35.130 --> 44:37.850
I was like that when I
used to play basketball,

44:37.850 --> 44:40.260
when I used to skate or whatever.

44:40.260 --> 44:43.800
Whatever I did, I always wanted
to kind of improve myself

44:43.800 --> 44:44.963
as much as I could.

44:59.535 --> 45:00.868
- [Mich] Whoosh!

45:03.600 --> 45:05.790
- Being with Erik and Joey all the time

45:05.790 --> 45:08.600
has been pretty crazy, they're
both kinda nuts. (laughs)

45:08.600 --> 45:11.430
They always, they're wanting
to train all the time.

45:11.430 --> 45:12.820
I'm more of a person that likes to

45:12.820 --> 45:15.110
kind of take some rest days in between.

45:15.110 --> 45:17.290
But they're always just kinda go, go, go.

45:17.290 --> 45:20.490
And it definitely showed me on
this tour, it showed me that

45:20.490 --> 45:22.010
you can train every day as long as

45:22.010 --> 45:23.730
you're really doing rehab and stuff.

45:23.730 --> 45:25.950
But, yeah, the combination of them,

45:25.950 --> 45:28.430
going to these new spots and
seeing these new communities,

45:28.430 --> 45:30.230
and training with all of these new people,

45:30.230 --> 45:33.020
just kinda brings this
fire in them, and I see it,

45:33.020 --> 45:34.780
and then it gets me all excited,

45:34.780 --> 45:35.970
and I just want to train as well,

45:35.970 --> 45:39.723
so it just kinda happens. (laughs)

45:40.874 --> 45:42.260
- Oh my God!
- Dude, you made that look--

45:42.260 --> 45:43.873
- So easy!
- So simple!

45:43.873 --> 45:45.710
- [Jesse] After some much-needed rest

45:45.710 --> 45:47.430
and a couple of card games later,

45:47.430 --> 45:48.920
we got back on the road.

45:48.920 --> 45:52.280
But not before picking
up the rock star himself.

45:52.280 --> 45:56.093
He's playing at the
playground. (RV horn beeps)

- What's up, guys.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.430
- So sweaty!
- (laughter) Come here!

about the parkour community

46:08.730 --> 46:10.540
is getting to have friends from literally

46:10.540 --> 46:11.990
all around the world,

46:11.990 --> 46:14.580
and how, as pro's, we get to
hang out and train together

46:14.580 --> 46:16.730
in different countries
throughout the year.

46:16.730 --> 46:18.020
But every time we see each other,

46:18.020 --> 46:19.523
it's like seeing family again.

46:24.548 --> 46:26.798
(laughter)

46:29.164 --> 46:30.247
So.
- Whaddup.

46:31.438 --> 46:34.521
- Oh, it's chill in here.
- Hey, dude.

46:38.140 --> 46:40.060
- [Jesse] We finally
made it to New York City

46:40.060 --> 46:41.760
but we only had four hours to go

46:41.760 --> 46:43.580
before we had to get back on the bus.

46:43.580 --> 46:46.787
So we jumped on a train got right into it.

48:22.720 --> 48:23.553
While on the road,

48:23.553 --> 48:25.890
we had a group of
athletes reach out nearby.

48:25.890 --> 48:27.780
So we posted up on social media,

48:27.780 --> 48:30.573
saying that we'd stop in,
have an impromptu jam.

48:31.599 --> 48:34.116
- New pair of shoes.

48:34.116 --> 48:35.533
New pair of feet.

48:36.468 --> 48:37.740
That's how I feel right now.

48:37.740 --> 48:39.630
- We are in West Hartford.

48:39.630 --> 48:41.380
Got my bodyguard with me, big Mich.

48:42.250 --> 48:44.350
We're doing a meet and greet.

48:44.350 --> 48:45.910
We going to say hi to some locals,

48:45.910 --> 48:47.370
and see if anyone's out here.

48:47.370 --> 48:48.780
- Hi, you met me before, actually.

48:48.780 --> 48:49.613
- How are you?

48:50.762 --> 48:51.859
Oh, good.
- I am

48:51.859 --> 48:55.208
really nervous right now. (laughter)

49:34.507 --> 49:35.857

49:35.857 --> 49:37.070
I don't know what we're gonna do.

49:37.070 --> 49:38.720
- [Jesse] Right as things got going,

49:38.720 --> 49:40.430
a bunch of cops showed up.

49:40.430 --> 49:42.760
Luckily for us, the West
Hartford parkour community

49:42.760 --> 49:45.290
has a great relationship
with their local authority,

49:45.290 --> 49:48.716
and they actually allowed
us to continue to train.

49:48.716 --> 49:52.299
(dynamic electronic music)

50:49.076 --> 50:51.411
- That was dope, though, good job!

50:51.411 --> 50:54.253
(laughs) How'd it come out?

50:54.253 --> 50:56.370
- What did you just get?
- Got some books, you know.

50:56.370 --> 50:58.682
- Oh, nice.
- Wait, where'd you go?

50:58.682 --> 51:00.814
- The library.
- Like, "Where did Mich go?"

51:00.814 --> 51:02.173
Oh, he's just buying some books.

51:02.173 --> 51:03.006

we're on the Lace Up Tour, you never knew,

51:25.780 --> 51:28.550
we're going to a city near you!

51:28.550 --> 51:32.697
I'm comin', gonna go through! (laughs)

51:48.400 --> 51:51.210
- [Jesse] Today's stop was one
of the most unique locations

51:51.210 --> 51:52.460
of the tour.

51:52.460 --> 51:55.800
Sidney and I's Team Yokohama
teammate, Travis Pastrana,

51:55.800 --> 51:58.370
allowed us to stop by
the famed Pastranaland

51:58.370 --> 52:00.193
to do whatever we wanted.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.193
And for some of us,

52:03.370 --> 52:06.730
this was even a bigger dream
come true than for others.

52:06.730 --> 52:08.674
- [Jeff] You just put in the code?

52:08.674 --> 52:09.507
Ha ha ha!

52:10.690 --> 52:12.070
- Check that out.

52:12.070 --> 52:14.160
Oh My God!

52:14.160 --> 52:19.160
Being at Pastranaland was
huge for me, it was massive.

52:20.390 --> 52:22.167
Whenever anybody asks a parkour guy,

52:22.167 --> 52:24.157
"How did you get into parkour,
did you see a YouTube video

52:24.157 --> 52:24.990
"or something like that?"

52:24.990 --> 52:26.810
For me, it was Pastranaland.

52:26.810 --> 52:31.060
I used to watch videos on
that since I was five to 10,

52:31.060 --> 52:33.060
and it actually made me get up and go

52:33.060 --> 52:34.640
to do what I wanted to do.

52:34.640 --> 52:37.220
Especially at that time, as
motocross, I just wanted to

52:37.220 --> 52:38.430
go out and I wanted to explore,

52:38.430 --> 52:40.551
I wanted to really find things.

52:40.551 --> 52:42.700
Dude. (laughter)

52:42.700 --> 52:44.400
this is insane.

52:44.400 --> 52:48.410
I've spent so much time,
just watching this foam pit

52:48.410 --> 52:49.243
in my life.

52:50.570 --> 52:52.680
It was also Travis Pastrana's house.

52:52.680 --> 52:55.250
And I thought to myself, that
would be the coolest place

52:55.250 --> 52:59.120
to really go, to be at, to get better at.

52:59.120 --> 53:00.890
And I never thought I would be there.

53:00.890 --> 53:02.320
But then, when you told me

53:02.320 --> 53:03.890
that this was going to be on the tour,

53:03.890 --> 53:07.970
I really, it really
amped me up, I would say.

53:07.970 --> 53:08.883
Because it was one of those things

53:08.883 --> 53:10.100
that I kind of put in the past,

53:10.100 --> 53:11.330
saying that it wasn't going to happen,

53:11.330 --> 53:12.490
and now it's happening.

53:12.490 --> 53:15.162
And so that was really, really cool to me.

let's go!

53:35.216 --> 53:38.216
("Way Up" by Feeki)

55:26.890 --> 55:28.130

55:28.130 --> 55:29.640
I found some descents and stuff.

55:29.640 --> 55:33.000
But really, when I got there, all I saw

55:33.000 --> 55:35.370
was the things that were iconic,

55:35.370 --> 55:38.450
like the foam pit, all
the ramps and everything,

55:38.450 --> 55:40.790
it was kind of like tingling
in the back of my head,

55:40.790 --> 55:42.150
I needed to get on a bike,

55:42.150 --> 55:44.630
and I needed to just find
something to do a back flip on.

55:44.630 --> 55:46.130
'Cause that was one of the main things

55:46.130 --> 55:47.430
I've ever wanted to do.

55:47.430 --> 55:48.680
- This dude's been riding

55:49.950 --> 55:51.220
motocross bikes since before I was born

55:51.220 --> 55:53.493
and winning prizes at it. (laughter)

He's better at riding a
motorbike than I am at walking.

Pastrana's bike right here,

some back flips into this.

- Whooh!

thing that can happen, so,

- What?

57:23.444 --> 57:25.694
(cheering)

57:26.893 --> 57:28.360
- When we went on the
inside, it was really cool

57:28.360 --> 57:30.020
to actually see that little foam pit,

57:30.020 --> 57:31.010
because I've always seen that,

57:31.010 --> 57:32.210
and you have everything around you,

57:32.210 --> 57:34.000
which is pretty cool,
but it's kind of small.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.220
So doing that back flip
was really awesome.

57:36.220 --> 57:38.110
The real deal was the outside.

57:38.110 --> 57:39.550
That was the big foam pit,

57:39.550 --> 57:42.480
that was the one that I
have laid my childhood on.

57:42.480 --> 57:45.310
So I really wanted to hit a
double back flip out there.

All right ladies and gentlemen,

57:47.160 --> 57:49.760

that all of the stuff
goes down right here.

All right, so that first try

did not go so well.

58:38.260 --> 58:39.810
The second one was much better.

59:06.480 --> 59:08.280
So, the bottom line of Pastranaland was

59:08.280 --> 59:10.160
we did not have long enough.

59:10.160 --> 59:12.860
That place was so,

59:12.860 --> 59:15.440
I would even say historical, for me,

59:15.440 --> 59:17.500
that I just needed to be there,

59:17.500 --> 59:19.210
and I needed to really feel it,

59:19.210 --> 59:22.090

there and being in that place,

it felt like what a kid
feels for Disneyland,

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.563
And just based on the overall
reaction that everyone gave,

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.303
I just knew it probably wasn't good.

- Oh!

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:33.210
- [Sydney] Get Rob!

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:37.767
- [Jesse] Lay him out flat!

01:05:39.661 --> 01:05:41.080
- Can someone call 911?
- His neck, his neck.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.230
He went straight in, his neck,
- Call 911.

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:47.380
- Let him breathe.
- Seeing Corbin on the ground

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:51.120
like that was, uh, a bit
of a struggle for me.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.793
You know, on one hand,

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:59.440
you want to help someone
who's clearly not okay.

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.773
And on the other hand, you
kinda have this job to do.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.116
- Corbin, you breathing?
- Corbin.

01:06:08.116 --> 01:06:09.780
- As long as he's breathing,
- Yeah.

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.758
- Check his
- No, Corbin, stay down.

01:06:11.758 --> 01:06:12.660
I need you to stay down, Corbin.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.150
- Okay, okay, okay.
- There you go.

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:16.490
No, no, no, no, Corbin, stay down.

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:17.680
Stay down, Corbin.

01:06:22.995 --> 01:06:25.801
- Was there any loss of consciousness?

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.253
- Watching Corbin go down in Orlando was,

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:25.740
was a shock to the
entire crew and the tour

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.320
and all the athletes.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.350
I think seeing how
fragile our bodies can be

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:33.150
and how a head injury can, like,

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.560
put a huge hold on your life,

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.560
having to sit in front of him at the ER,

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:42.000

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.610
and now dealing with him
trying to learn to speak again

01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:47.340
is like this thing that

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.360
pauses me to reflect

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.710
in a way that I've never had to

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.803
look at myself in a way before.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.140
I felt a personal
responsibility with this tour

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.520
being created by me

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.540
and the guilt of Corbin getting injured.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.360
I didn't know what to do,

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.920
it didn't feel right leaving him, but

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.193
we had to keep moving.

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:15.610
After Corbin's injury,
it just so happened that

01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:18.359
some of the other athletes
were scheduled to leave tour.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.250
So, it was just down to Sydney and I,

01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:23.180
and we had one more city to hit

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.497
before we started to head home.

("Hittaa" by Bushey)

01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:52.500
This tour taught me a lot.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.060
I learned never to take life for granted,

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:58.110
and that it will always
throw obstacles in your way.

01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:01.610
But it's how you react and
overcome those challenges

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:03.113
that dictate your future.

01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:06.470
And the way Corbin handled his injury

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:08.863
will forever inspire all of us.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.387
- I don't know, I guess
it's kind of a blank space.

01:10:12.387 --> 01:10:17.260
You know, it's weird having
that black, black dark space

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:18.093
where I just don't know what happened,

01:10:18.093 --> 01:10:20.240
because I know it's
there, I've seen footage,

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.790
and it's just not there,
it's not there in my head.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.270
I felt like I was normal,

01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:29.860
I felt like I was talking,
I could talk to people,

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.420
but then I found out
a long time afterward,

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.920
it was probably months after,

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.860
that what I was saying wasn't correct.

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.433
What I was saying wasn't
even close to correct.

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.470
Everything I was doing was gibberish.

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.840
But yeah, I took speech
therapy for two months.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.510
After that I had physical therapy,

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.050
and so I had to get my legs back.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.670
Anytime I tried to lift my
foot, it would be very hard

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.370
to go from my brain to my foot.

01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:00.550
So I would try to do this
but it just wouldn't happen.

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:02.597
And I was just looking at
my legs, like, "Come on.

01:11:02.597 --> 01:11:03.690
"We can do this."

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:06.920
And, uh, yeah, it didn't
happen for a long time.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.480
I think it's something
that needed to happen,

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.250
I think it's something that had to happen,

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:12.384
and now I'm kinda better because of it.

and explore foreign lands.

We can start teams and build
brands to fund our endeavors.

01:11:54.354 --> 01:11:56.300
(cheering) We can create competitions

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.370
and host our own events
to support the sport

01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:00.030
from the inside out.

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:02.870
We can pack a giant purple
tour bus full of pro athletes

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:05.800
and tour an entire country for two months.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.223
We can do whatever we want.

But none of it is why we come together.

training, together or alone,

none of that stuff matters.

completely met my life goal, where

I could make a career out of this

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.410
and just focus on this and nothing else.

wake up in a new city, see new people,

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.300
see new spots, and train.

It's been a dream of mine for
as long as I've been training.

all move in a similar way.

the movement's still there,

about especially the tour itself,

I still kinda come back to my own,

01:14:58.630 --> 01:15:00.400

we're all gonna do free running.

one thing that connects us,

It leaves marks on your memory,

reshapes your heart,

It binds you to those

You take something with you.

We have this thing that we love so much,
