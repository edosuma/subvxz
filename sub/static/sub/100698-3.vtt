-[narrator] Previously...
-I made a choice in the water.

00:03.830 --> 00:05.790
-I had a chance to save him.
-You let him die.

00:05.790 --> 00:08.000
-So, what does this mean?
-I don't know.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.790
It feels different now.

00:09.790 --> 00:11.330
Robb Wellens started
this project

00:11.330 --> 00:13.670
to clean plastic
from the ocean.

00:13.670 --> 00:16.120
Do you want to grab a bite,
and I could tell you
about the energy data?

00:16.120 --> 00:18.290
What is it? Application
for the Sheriff's Academy.

00:18.290 --> 00:20.210
Fill out the paperwork,
hand it in end of day.

00:20.210 --> 00:22.170
The procedure went
exceptionally well.

00:22.170 --> 00:23.830
They implanted the first
embryo in you.

00:23.830 --> 00:27.830
A mermaid baby isn't compatible
in a human body.

00:27.830 --> 00:31.960
Sarge, he was trying to tell me
something. What does it mean?

00:31.960 --> 00:34.620
War is coming.

00:34.620 --> 00:37.000
You're suggesting we continue
the treatments at an increased
dosage.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.670
- We extracted them from
Ryn's sister.
- After you dug up her grave.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.000
Oh, my God.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.620
It's only half transformed.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.000
We buried her.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.540
She is one from another tribe.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.170
I will put an end
to these humans,

00:47.170 --> 00:49.460
and to you
if you interfere.

00:49.460 --> 00:50.880
[grunts]

00:52.120 --> 00:54.120
-It's really bad
-She's strong.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.210
Stronger than any
I've ever seen.

00:56.210 --> 00:57.880
Stronger than Ryn.

01:16.500 --> 01:17.710
[soft gasp]

01:22.790 --> 01:23.960
Ryn!

01:25.080 --> 01:26.250
You need to rest.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.170
No. No rest.

01:28.170 --> 01:31.170
Your body needs
time to heal.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.830
Okay, come on.

01:32.830 --> 01:36.080
Before, it did not take me
so long to heal.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.380
Why?

01:38.380 --> 01:41.580
Your injuries
were very bad this time.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.330
I fight hard before.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.920
This is different.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.420
Maybe because I am
human for so long.

01:47.420 --> 01:49.330
Harder to heal.

01:49.330 --> 01:52.080
That's possible.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.380
Ryn, you should know.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.460
I saw Sarge again.

01:56.460 --> 01:58.290
I went to the ocean.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.830
I saw him under the water.

01:59.830 --> 02:05.250
He told me
war is coming.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.330
It is her.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.120
I must be ready.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.380
For 50 years this milk crate
was floating in the ocean.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.830
I couldn't believe it.

02:28.830 --> 02:30.420
Hmm.

02:30.420 --> 02:32.460
And this is boring
the crap out of you.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.710
No, sorry.

02:34.710 --> 02:36.750
It's just been a crazy
couple of days.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.080
I know I talk a lot,

02:39.080 --> 02:41.000
but I'm actually
not a bad listener.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.250
A friend of mine got hurt.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.170
She should be fine,
but I've been helping her out.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.830
Sorry to hear that.

02:50.830 --> 02:53.830
Yeah. I appreciate you being
cool with a quick coffee.

02:53.830 --> 02:55.960
Of course. Of course.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.500
I like you.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.750
And I want to get to know you,
at whatever pace.

03:03.670 --> 03:05.460
But sometimes I come on
too strong,

03:05.460 --> 03:06.710
like a socially inept dork.

03:06.710 --> 03:08.380
Just tell me to back off.

03:08.380 --> 03:11.710
I like
socially inept dorks.

03:11.710 --> 03:14.210
[both laugh]

03:18.040 --> 03:21.080
Would you want
to go with me to do...

03:22.250 --> 03:24.330
to do a gyre cleanup?

03:24.330 --> 03:27.500
Did you just invite me
on a date to a garbage pile?

03:27.500 --> 03:29.420
Not a date,

03:29.420 --> 03:32.000
though that would be
quite romantic.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.670
No...

03:33.670 --> 03:34.790
as colleagues.

03:38.540 --> 03:42.170
It'd be amazing to go,
see the project in action.

03:42.170 --> 03:43.830
You had some great thoughts
the other night,

03:43.830 --> 03:46.330
about how to tweak
the machine.

03:46.330 --> 03:48.670
I like how
your brain works.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.880
Look, just think about it.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.420
Let's go, McClure.
We don't have all day.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.750
McClure!

04:05.540 --> 04:07.120
[Xander]
Drop your weapon!

04:07.120 --> 04:08.420
I'm not going down for this!

04:13.960 --> 04:15.750
We can still
end this peacefully.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.380
Just put your gun down
and slide it over!

04:18.380 --> 04:19.960
Come and get it!

04:19.960 --> 04:21.830
[Brigg]
Come on, McClure. Focus.

04:26.540 --> 04:27.580
[Ben]
Xander, wait!

04:29.920 --> 04:31.210
Bang, bang!

04:31.210 --> 04:33.620
McClure, you're dead.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.290
[sighs]

04:36.290 --> 04:38.920
You can't take your eyes
off the prize, people.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.250
Every day,
you're on the front line.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.580
You're going to see
some crazy shit.

04:43.580 --> 04:46.380
You're the one between
innocent people getting hurt

04:46.380 --> 04:47.790
and a total free-for-all.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.580
All right, sprints!

04:50.710 --> 04:52.210
McClure.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.710
Go.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.170
That's it.
All the way down.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.540
Good.

05:02.540 --> 05:03.880
Just one more.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.290
-Good, Elaine.
-Wow, Mom.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.040
-Look at you.
-Hey.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.290
What a nice surprise.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.080
I'll de done
in a minute.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.790
[Ava]
All right. Let's get you seated.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.830
You said you wanted
to talk to me?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.670
Yeah, let's go out here.

05:29.380 --> 05:33.040
All right,
I'll get the TheraBand.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.880
I...

05:34.880 --> 05:37.460
I think I should
try standing.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.880
Let's take it slow.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.580
We just got your upper body
strength up.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.120
[sighs]

05:48.290 --> 05:49.620
[door opens]

[door closes]

06:06.670 --> 06:07.880
[gasps]

06:11.170 --> 06:13.040
I have some questions
about this study.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.880
What they've been
putting in your mother.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.880
Stem cells from some deep-sea
marine creature.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.580
Is it one of them?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.880
It's working, Dad.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.000
You... you knew,
and you let them anyway?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.670
We didn't have
a lot of options.

06:26.670 --> 06:28.330
You saw what she was like.

06:28.330 --> 06:30.380
She was dying.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.210
You didn't know
what it would do to her.

06:32.210 --> 06:34.120
-It could've killed her.
-But it didn't, did it?

06:34.120 --> 06:36.000
I need to talk
to Commander Kyle about this.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.830
Kyle's not
in charge anymore.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.960
There's been a change
of command.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.670
Look, I'm not even sure
if the treatment can continue.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.000
What's going on?

06:46.170 --> 06:47.830
-What?
-Mom!

06:47.830 --> 06:50.170
-Elaine! Get her, get her!
-Mom! Mom!

06:50.170 --> 06:52.750
[Ted]
Oh, my God! Get her!

06:52.750 --> 06:55.330
-Elaine.
-[Ava] Oh, my God! Elaine!

06:55.330 --> 06:57.420
What the hell happened?
Baby, what happened?

06:58.620 --> 07:00.580
Everyone relax.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.330
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.250
How long were you under?

07:05.250 --> 07:07.920
I don't know.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.330
A few minutes, maybe?
It's okay.

07:09.330 --> 07:10.750
A few minutes?

07:10.750 --> 07:12.500
[Elaine]
I'm okay.

07:18.290 --> 07:20.710
[Ryn]
Tia wants our territory,

07:20.710 --> 07:23.250
but we cannot
let her rule us.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.500
The tribe is violent.
Dangerous.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.500
I must stop her.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.920
-How? You are weak now.
-You stay to help me heal.

07:33.290 --> 07:36.500
And you. We will practice
fighting on land.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.960
Make me strong again.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.920
I make medicine for you.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.120
I can help.

07:42.620 --> 07:45.120
Katrina and the others
will stay in the water.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.790
Guard against her.

07:46.790 --> 07:49.000
They will wait
and watch for her.

07:51.580 --> 07:53.920
Tia will be going
back to her tribe,

07:53.920 --> 07:55.040
to lead them again.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.880
I must be ready.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.500
Attack like we fight
in water.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
Better if we fight
in water.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.670
First on land.

08:14.670 --> 08:16.000
Then in water.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.920
Anything you need,
just help yourself.

08:40.920 --> 08:45.210
I have bowls, a hand mixer,

08:45.210 --> 08:46.920
measuring cups.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.670
I bring this,
to make our medicine.

08:49.670 --> 08:52.330
Helpful and delicious.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.790
[whimpers and gasps]

09:07.500 --> 09:08.880
You're doing great.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.210
Okay...

09:23.170 --> 09:26.330
[Leena]
Her body temp is too high
for a mermaid baby.

09:26.330 --> 09:27.750
But she can only stay
in this ice bath

09:27.750 --> 09:29.080
for a half-hour, max.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.790
Then that's how long
she'll stay.

09:30.790 --> 09:33.540
If I could take her
to my lab at the ranch.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.250
No. No way.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.540
Anyone finds out about this,
they will keep her there.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.830
If we do nothing,
she could die.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.120
She won't.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.420
You won't let that happen.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.670
You teach me to read.

09:55.790 --> 09:57.040
Mm-hm.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.880
Ryn, it might not
be the best time.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.580
Tia is more human than Ryn.

10:05.580 --> 10:08.420
I must have knowledge
to be more human.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.830
Okay. I'll teach you to read.

10:12.830 --> 10:14.920
But, you know, an easy way
to get knowledge

10:14.920 --> 10:17.210
is just to ask your phone.

10:18.330 --> 10:20.000
What does phone know?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.880
A lot of things.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.120
[phone chimes]

How many bones
are in the human body?

The human body
includes 206 bones.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.420
-Three minutes.
-Three minutes?

13:03.420 --> 13:05.670
-Maybe more.
-How is that possible?

13:05.670 --> 13:07.960
No idea.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.960
I'm gonna take her
back there later,

13:09.960 --> 13:11.210
run some tests.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.420
Check her lungs.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.290
[knock on door]

13:16.290 --> 13:17.670
One sec.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.710
[door opens]

13:24.710 --> 13:25.830
-[Robb] Hey.
-[Maddie] Hey!

13:27.670 --> 13:29.170
[Robb]
For you. Indian food.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.460
[Maddie]
Oh, thank you.

13:31.670 --> 13:33.620
-Come in.
-[Robb] Thank you.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.380
You said you were
taking care of your friend,

13:35.380 --> 13:37.670
but somebody's got to take care
of the caretaker, so...

13:41.420 --> 13:42.670
Hey, man.

13:42.670 --> 13:43.830
Robb Wellens.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.170
Ben Pownall.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.670
I got to run.

13:53.670 --> 13:55.750
I'm bringing my friend
some food, so...

13:55.750 --> 13:58.830
Oh, sorry. Yeah, sure.
I don't mean to disturb.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.040
Wow.

14:01.330 --> 14:02.750
That's a lot of fish.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.330
Omega-3s.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.330
Call me later.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.330
I will. I will.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.880
Thanks for the food.
That was sweet.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.120
Of course.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.880
See you.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.170
-Okay.
-[door opens]

14:29.500 --> 14:30.670
[door closes]

14:32.170 --> 14:34.000
New friend?

14:35.290 --> 14:36.460
Yeah.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.880
Cool.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.920
[Meredith sighs]

14:45.920 --> 14:48.250
[Leena]
Here. Lay down.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.080
[winces]

14:53.750 --> 14:55.330
[groans]

15:01.540 --> 15:03.540
[Meredith]
I think...

15:03.540 --> 15:04.880
I think the baby's coming.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.210
You're not dilated yet,

15:06.210 --> 15:08.210
and the contractions
are too far apart.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.000
It's been ten minutes.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.500
These are Braxton Hicks.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.920
False contractions.

15:14.170 --> 15:15.500
It hurts.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.290
She needs medicine.
Terbutaline.

15:21.290 --> 15:23.000
It'll delay
the contractions.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.460
Give her some relief.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.580
Go.

15:27.580 --> 15:30.000
And don't talk to anyone.
And come right back.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.580
I'll be back soon.

15:39.670 --> 15:41.080
[yells]

15:41.080 --> 15:42.920
[gasps and pants]

15:42.920 --> 15:44.170
Ryn?

15:50.880 --> 15:52.380
[Elaine]
Ben?

15:52.380 --> 15:53.710
You okay?

15:53.710 --> 15:55.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.670
Just got a lot on my mind.

15:57.670 --> 15:59.920
-Don't you worry about me.
-No, I know.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.210
-Nothing can bring you down.
-[Elaine laughs]

16:02.210 --> 16:04.330
So how are your friends?

16:04.330 --> 16:07.210
Maddie. Ryn.

16:07.210 --> 16:09.460
We don't need
to talk about that right now.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.960
Okay, fine,
I just thought

16:12.960 --> 16:14.830
you might need
someone to talk to.

16:14.830 --> 16:17.330
And, I mean,
I know how these relationships

16:17.330 --> 16:18.750
can be complicated.

16:21.670 --> 16:22.830
You know?

16:22.830 --> 16:24.830
I assume.

16:24.830 --> 16:27.670
[Ava]
We ready?

16:27.670 --> 16:29.580
This is a spirometry test,

16:29.580 --> 16:31.750
to determine
your lung capacity.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.290
Put that on.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.960
Mm-hm.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.500
You'll inhale
as deep as you can,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.080
and then exhale in here.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.290
Okay?

16:43.290 --> 16:44.620
And...

16:44.620 --> 16:45.830
-[inhales]
-[machine beeps]

16:45.830 --> 16:47.290
...go.

16:47.290 --> 16:49.170
[exhales]

16:56.500 --> 16:58.500
Must be a mistake.

17:00.710 --> 17:02.040
-[machine beeps]
-What?

17:03.460 --> 17:05.500
Your lung capacity
is enormous.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.710
Like an Olympic swimmer.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.120
[Elaine laughs]

17:13.750 --> 17:16.120
Come on! Piece of crap.

17:16.120 --> 17:18.000
You going to choke
just hanging up the target?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.790
Jeez, McClure.

17:19.790 --> 17:23.580
I like to coast through life
on my good looks.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.920
[gunshots]

17:38.000 --> 17:39.830
-[bullet clatters]
-Oh, jeez.

17:41.330 --> 17:43.670
Hey. Focus.

17:43.670 --> 17:46.540
What happened before,
that was in the past.

17:46.540 --> 17:48.920
You let every mistake throw you,
you'll never get over it.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.250
Got to move forward.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.170
[Annie]
Good shooting.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.710
That's lichen.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.540
Old man's beard.

18:45.540 --> 18:48.620
My people use it
to heal wounds.

18:48.620 --> 18:51.040
We can use in fight.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.500
The war Sarge warned of?

18:53.500 --> 18:54.830
Yes.

18:56.830 --> 18:59.960
Do you think it will be
dangerous for your people?

18:59.960 --> 19:02.580
More will die, yes.

19:02.580 --> 19:05.380
And go to the spirit world?

19:05.380 --> 19:06.880
We're not afraid.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.500
We will see our family.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.170
[laughs]

19:10.170 --> 19:12.500
Oh, I wish I could
see Sarge again.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.330
Maybe. If you go back to water.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.250
Yeah, I might drown if I take
another midnight dip.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.580
There is another way.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.000
To visit the spirits?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.170
But is dangerous for you.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.540
How?

19:34.710 --> 19:37.290
Eliza, please.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.210
I really need
to see Sarge again.

19:42.460 --> 19:45.670
I bring for you
herbs from sea.

19:56.170 --> 19:57.420
How are you doing?

19:58.580 --> 20:00.080
Pain comes in waves.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.170
Not all at once.

20:02.170 --> 20:04.000
I think you might
be bleeding inside.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.170
From the fight.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.000
Maybe. Yes.

20:10.330 --> 20:12.170
We need to get you
to a doctor.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.420
What doctor?

20:13.420 --> 20:15.830
That woman from the ranch.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.080
You must go back
to the water.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.420
Defend our territory.

20:22.420 --> 20:24.210
[Hunter]
I will go right away.

20:24.210 --> 20:26.920
You are hurt?

20:26.920 --> 20:28.830
I will see a doctor.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.290
A human who heals.

20:30.290 --> 20:31.500
[Cami]
I will stay.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.040
We are family.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.290
[knock on door]

21:12.290 --> 21:13.670
Hey.

21:15.380 --> 21:18.580
We thought we might
find you here.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.830
Maddie, Ryn.

21:20.830 --> 21:22.420
And this is Cami.

21:24.710 --> 21:26.380
How are you doing?

21:26.380 --> 21:27.960
Not great, actually.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.460
Ryn's experiencing pain
in her lower abdomen.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.080
Really?

21:32.080 --> 21:33.880
She was in a fight recently,

21:33.880 --> 21:35.830
but I worry there might
be some internal bleeding.

21:35.830 --> 21:37.420
Maybe you could
check her out?

21:39.170 --> 21:41.420
I am supposed to see
another patient.

21:41.420 --> 21:44.540
Please, Leena.
She needs help.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.580
Of course.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.080
You must be feeling pretty good.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.500
Looks like I have a future
in deep-sea diving.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.330
-[chuckles]
-A world-record setter.

21:58.330 --> 22:00.120
You know, it's funny.

22:00.120 --> 22:03.040
When I was under there,
I wasn't scared

22:03.040 --> 22:05.000
or thinking about how long
I could hold my breath.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.460
It was...
it was almost peaceful.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.460
Still.

22:09.460 --> 22:13.710
Probably shouldn't go
on any more solo dives.

22:13.710 --> 22:16.000
So when do you think I can get
my next round of injections?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.210
I haven't been able to reach
the doctor to schedule it yet.

22:19.540 --> 22:21.040
Dad didn't tell you?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.540
What?

22:25.880 --> 22:27.040
All right.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.170
[clears throat]

22:30.040 --> 22:31.170
What?

22:33.710 --> 22:36.500
There might not be
more injections.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.170
What do you mean? Why?

22:41.250 --> 22:43.670
Commander Kyle moved on.

22:43.670 --> 22:45.750
Okay, well,

22:45.750 --> 22:48.000
surely they can find
someone else.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.460
I'm not sure, Mom.

22:50.830 --> 22:52.420
Without the cells, I...

22:53.670 --> 22:54.830
Hey.

22:56.830 --> 23:01.210
Mom, I'm going to do everything
I can to make sure you're okay.

23:07.170 --> 23:08.790
[monitor beeps]

23:08.790 --> 23:11.000
No sign of bleeding.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.290
[gasps]

23:12.290 --> 23:14.330
There. That's the pain.

23:14.330 --> 23:16.170
[Leena]
Her uterus is contracting.

23:16.170 --> 23:18.040
Is she pregnant?

23:18.040 --> 23:19.120
No.

23:21.710 --> 23:24.080
How often has this
been happening?

23:25.670 --> 23:27.290
About every ten minutes.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.210
Do you have anything
that you can give her
to help with her pain?

23:36.710 --> 23:38.000
[sighs]

23:42.000 --> 23:43.670
This should help
with the contractions.

23:44.670 --> 23:47.000
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.830
Thank you for your help.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.330
Of course.

23:52.330 --> 23:56.330
For now, and also for when
we try to make a baby.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.620
I'm sorry we weren't
able to do it.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.920
[Cami]
You try to have a baby?

24:04.080 --> 24:05.460
With human science.

24:05.460 --> 24:07.120
But no baby?

24:08.830 --> 24:10.120
It didn't work.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.000
Baby would save us.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.790
Help tribe survive.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.830
[Ryn] It would have
been a great honor

24:19.830 --> 24:23.290
to have the first baby
in many tides.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.170
Your baby...

24:33.830 --> 24:35.830
She's alive.

24:38.420 --> 24:40.380
What are you talking about?

24:41.580 --> 24:43.330
When Ryn was taken,

24:43.330 --> 24:47.920
we implanted one of her
embryos in a female hybrid.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.500
Her name is Meredith.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.120
[gasps]

24:54.210 --> 24:55.540
Where is she?

24:55.540 --> 24:57.380
I'm so sorry.

24:57.380 --> 24:59.210
We shouldn't
have done it.

24:59.210 --> 25:00.620
I go to her.

25:00.620 --> 25:02.540
No, it's dangerous.

25:02.540 --> 25:04.000
Bryan is with her.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.330
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

25:07.170 --> 25:08.330
We go.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.750
Hold on, we have to be smart
and make a plan.

25:11.750 --> 25:13.000
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Just...

25:15.750 --> 25:17.170
One sec.

25:17.170 --> 25:18.420
Hello?

25:21.620 --> 25:23.540
We go to save the baby.

25:29.540 --> 25:31.420
I hate to do this,
but I don't think now

25:31.420 --> 25:33.380
is the time to take a trip.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.420
-Your friend?
-Yeah.

25:35.420 --> 25:37.080
Things got more
complicated with her.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.000
Is she okay?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.500
It's kind of hard to explain,
but I just...

25:41.500 --> 25:44.670
I'm sorry, I can't
leave right now.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.790
No, I understand.

25:46.790 --> 25:49.210
You know, it's not that
I don't want to go. I do.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.290
It'd be amazing
to be there with you,

25:51.290 --> 25:53.120
to work on that project, but...

25:53.120 --> 25:54.500
-It's complicated.
-Yeah.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.290
Yeah.

25:56.290 --> 25:58.040
The offer still stands,
whenever you're ready.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.670
Thanks for understanding, okay?

25:59.670 --> 26:01.170
I'll call you later.

26:01.170 --> 26:03.500
Yeah, I'll speak to you soon.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.170
[phone beeps off]

26:21.330 --> 26:22.540
She turn.

26:26.670 --> 26:27.920
[tires squeal]

26:29.750 --> 26:31.210
What is light?

26:31.210 --> 26:33.000
-[Ryn] Green means go.
-[Cami] Now?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.380
Go fast.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.920
[tires screech]

26:41.210 --> 26:42.710
[car horns honk]

27:48.500 --> 27:50.830
-Drink?
-Sure.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.290
[liquid pouring]

27:54.000 --> 27:55.670
Your telephone call
made it sound

27:55.670 --> 27:57.750
like it couldn't wait
till morning.

28:01.670 --> 28:03.880
When Mom had her accident,

28:03.880 --> 28:05.330
you said that you would
do anything.

28:05.330 --> 28:06.960
-Ben--
-Anything you could to help her.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.580
Yeah, I was talking about real
medical science.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.330
-She's so much better.
-From what we can see.

28:13.330 --> 28:16.120
We don't know anything
about possible side effects
down the line.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.080
And that's her choice.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.460
These...things.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.710
Nobody knows
anything about them.

28:20.710 --> 28:22.670
I do.

28:22.670 --> 28:24.960
You didn't even know they
existed till five minutes ago.

28:24.960 --> 28:28.620
I've seen what
their cells can do, Dad.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.290
Anyway, it's a non-issue.

28:30.290 --> 28:32.120
You told me that they're
shutting down the trial,

28:32.120 --> 28:33.960
so it doesn't really matter,
does it?

28:33.960 --> 28:36.210
But if I could get
more cells--

28:36.210 --> 28:38.210
I don't want to play
a hypothetical game with you.

28:38.210 --> 28:39.920
It's not a hypothetical.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.540
Your mother's not
a guinea pig.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.120
What if I could prove
it was safe?

28:46.120 --> 28:47.880
I'm not having
this conversation.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.080
-What if I could prove it?
-Look, son...

28:51.330 --> 28:53.750
I don't care if it makes
her immortal.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.210
It's not happening.

Oh! All right!

30:25.330 --> 30:26.960
Hey.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.500
What are we having?

30:29.500 --> 30:32.500
Well, in that case,
I will have a double bourbon.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.420
Top shelf.

30:34.420 --> 30:36.290
Oh, way to take
advantage, Xan.

Hey, he earned it.

30:37.580 --> 30:39.620
-Sharpshooter over here.
-I try, I try.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.580
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Oh.

30:41.580 --> 30:42.790
Just one sec.

30:44.460 --> 30:45.830
Hey, Mads. What's up?

30:45.830 --> 30:47.500
Hey. I need a ride.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.080
-Are you okay?
-It's Ryn.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.170
She's missing.
She took my car.

30:51.170 --> 30:53.330
I tried calling Ben,
but he's not picking up.

30:53.330 --> 30:54.710
I'll text you the address.

30:54.710 --> 30:57.080
Yeah. Hey, I got you.
I got you.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.420
Okay.

[phone chimes]

31:02.620 --> 31:04.170
Actually, I...

31:04.170 --> 31:05.670
I got to run.

31:05.670 --> 31:07.460
Are you turning your back
on a free drink?

31:07.460 --> 31:09.960
Man of mystery.
What can I say?

31:09.960 --> 31:11.380
Well, enjoy.

31:19.170 --> 31:22.880
If it's anything like your
last concoction, I can't wait.

31:24.170 --> 31:27.170
Eat very small piece.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.670
Will it cause visions?

31:34.670 --> 31:36.210
Make me see things

31:36.210 --> 31:37.710
that aren't there?

31:37.710 --> 31:40.170
Not see. Go there.

31:40.170 --> 31:41.670
To spirit world.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.170
You feel?

31:51.170 --> 31:52.250
No.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.330
Maybe I should eat another...

32:05.120 --> 32:07.210
Sarge?

32:07.210 --> 32:08.830
Are you there?

My dad put a LoJack in my car.

I didn't mean
to crash your night.

34:11.330 --> 34:13.710
Oh, are you kidding? I wasn't
going to let you go by yourself

34:13.710 --> 34:16.040
to track down Ryn and her,
you know, crazy one.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.500
Thank you.

taking over your life, right?

Xander...

34:26.750 --> 34:28.330
It's all right.
All right.

34:28.330 --> 34:30.670
It's sacrilege to say
anything bad about them.

34:33.210 --> 34:37.170
Think about the fact they exist,
that we get to know them.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.960
I mean, it's...

34:39.960 --> 34:42.000
It's huge.
