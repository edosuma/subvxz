00:09.509 --> 00:11.010
Yeah, it's a shit show
over there, apparently.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.095
Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.516
my dad is out of it
by all accounts.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.518
You know,
Gerri Kellman in charge?

00:19.686 --> 00:21.730
Sorry, I mean,
Gerri's great, I actually--

00:21.813 --> 00:24.315
I actually love Gerri,
you know, but...

00:24.399 --> 00:28.027
Gerri is a time server
who's way out of her depth.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.280
Meanwhile, on the upside,
the DOJ and I

00:30.363 --> 00:33.032

of my immunity deal.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.410
So, yeah.

00:35.493 --> 00:39.914
- Does not look good for them.
Wow, right.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.377
All that's on background.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.463
Mm-hmm.
- Um... You know, as we said,
a lot of moving parts.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.339
But-- But-- Yeah, please,
let's-- let's dive in.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.799
So, you're okay
if I record this, right?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.384
Yeah, hey,
am I okay? I am--

00:51.468 --> 00:53.470
- I am great. Let's record.
- Great. Thank you.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.305
Open the kimono.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.141
Uh-- Oh. Thank you.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.060

You're quite concerned
with how you're gonna
come across.

Not really, no.

That's the family business.

the Sophie Iwobi monologue?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.958

But, you know,
it doesn't hurt now,

01:29.339 --> 01:30.548
because, uh...

01:32.425 --> 01:33.676
because I am who I am.

- So, where are they in this?

01:49.234 --> 01:50.944
Have you managed
to stay close with them?

01:53.029 --> 01:57.116
You know, sure. Absolutely.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.119
There-- There are issues,
but, uh...

02:02.914 --> 02:04.374
- essentially, yeah.
Hmm.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.336
I'm just really happy
in my headspace.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.825
I don't need him in my teeth
right now.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.077
Uh... I can--
I can scope that out.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.620
I can capture him tonight,
if we'd like,

05:29.704 --> 05:31.205
at the journalism dinner.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.374
But, you know,
what are we doing to counter?

05:33.958 --> 05:35.752
Yes! Yes!

05:35.835 --> 05:38.046
You should all be out there.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.547
Uh... Well,

05:39.630 --> 05:41.716
we did discuss
the town hall event...

05:41.799 --> 05:43.092
Yeah, I-- I like it.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.594
- It brings everyone together.
Yeah.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.764

there were a couple we liked.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.780
Full page with, uh,

06:03.863 --> 06:06.491
a number of pledges.
We can figure out the verbiage.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.201
And the tagline...

06:08.993 --> 06:11.245
"We get it."

06:11.329 --> 06:13.539
I thought it was quite funky.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.541
"We get it,"
a bit like those ladies

06:15.625 --> 06:16.959
on the cruise ship got it?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.504
Gerri liked it.
- Yeah, it's a little...

06:19.587 --> 06:23.174
"Yeah, yeah, we get it already,
stop moaning about the rapes."

06:23.257 --> 06:24.884
Logan, um...

06:24.967 --> 06:27.053
we have agents on the phone,
asking if Waystar is willing

06:27.136 --> 06:29.722
to accept service
of a document subpoena?

06:29.806 --> 06:32.141
- Tell 'em to fuck off.
Oh. Okay.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.811

...hang on. He's kidding.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.438

Logan.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.523

06:38.606 --> 06:40.608
when we might start
to play ball.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.945
I mean, everybody cooperates.

06:44.028 --> 06:47.198
Maybe I don't do that dance.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.658
And how does that feel
in regards

06:48.741 --> 06:50.159

06:50.785 --> 06:51.994
We don't accept service,

06:52.078 --> 06:54.205
in an hour, there's gonna be
two agents here to serve you,

06:54.288 --> 06:56.124
and while they're at it,
they could subpoena you

06:56.207 --> 06:57.959
- to the grand jury.
Fuck 'em.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.839
Logan?
- Tell 'em to fuck off.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.636
FBI! Hands up!
- Hey, how's it going?

07:08.719 --> 07:09.929
To be honest,
not great, Greg.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.681
It's looking pretty bad
with the investigation,

07:11.764 --> 07:15.017
and, um... Logan says
we have to take these.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.147
Cyanide pills, the whole team.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.817
- It's a mint, you doofus.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.153
Take one.
Your breath really does stink.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.238
- Hey, can I show you something?
Yeah?

07:27.321 --> 07:29.490
Come on.

07:29.574 --> 07:33.703
Gregory, my chief of staff,
leggy princeling of ATN,

07:33.786 --> 07:35.997
you deserve a new...

07:36.080 --> 07:37.582
...office. What do you think?

07:39.083 --> 07:43.671
I mean... it's, uh--
it's-- it's not very nice.

07:43.754 --> 07:47.300
That's rude, rude boy.
It's your new place.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.260
Okay, I see.
This is punishment, right?

07:49.343 --> 07:51.804
This is because I'm not taking
the company lawyer?

07:51.888 --> 07:54.307
Right? Am I-- Am I getting
demoted right now?

07:54.390 --> 07:56.934
In the middle
of an investigation? No.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.562
No, this is just part
of a totally standard

07:59.645 --> 08:02.481
office rationalization. No!

08:02.565 --> 08:05.026
No, no, no,
you do whatever you like.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.195
You know, hang out with Kendall.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.446
Take your own counsel.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.364
I hear you have a really
great lawyer.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.783
Is it true you can find him
any time, day or night?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.660
Yes.
-'Cause he has
one of those bowties

08:14.744 --> 08:15.995
that lights up and spins around?

08:16.078 --> 08:19.207
He's actually really good.
I'm very, very happy with him.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.250
Listen. On the level, buddy...

08:23.502 --> 08:25.463
On the level,
there are a million knives

08:25.546 --> 08:27.590

So, I understand, I get it.
I see that this is tough.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.015
I have gone Waystar.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.059
I think that's safest, but...

08:39.769 --> 08:42.063
tonight, I'm actually
seeing a pal

08:42.146 --> 08:44.232
to get an objective take
on my situation,

08:44.315 --> 08:46.067
and if you want,

08:46.150 --> 08:48.527
- if you want, I can fold you in.
- Tonight?

08:48.611 --> 08:50.154
Yeah, I just thought,
you know, over a beer,

08:50.238 --> 08:52.031
we could kick back
and recall what happened

08:52.114 --> 08:53.783
and make sure
that we remember it

08:53.866 --> 08:56.202
- exactly the same way.
Mm-hmm.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.913
- Um...
What?

08:58.996 --> 09:00.915
- No, it's just Ken--
- Fuck Ken.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.959
Yeah, no, fuck Ken,
100 percent,

09:03.042 --> 09:04.794
- but-- but he's--
But what?

09:04.877 --> 09:09.131
It's... stupid, he's giving me
a watch tonight to say thanks,

09:09.215 --> 09:13.761
- um, for-- so I don't know, I--
- You sold your ass for a watch?

09:13.844 --> 09:17.848
I'll buy you a watch, dickwad.
Just fucking come over.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.184
Okay, I'll try to come.
I wanna come.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.271
Stay.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.943
You know,
your dad just wondered,

09:29.026 --> 09:31.654

about your father feels

09:31.737 --> 09:34.782
- really one-sided...
- Yes, we would love your help

09:34.865 --> 09:36.659
- getting more dimensions.
- Mm-hmm?

09:36.742 --> 09:40.121
It would be totally controlled,
business interview,

09:40.204 --> 09:42.123

come in the form we like,
but what Kendall Roy did

11:11.087 --> 11:12.671
was important and brave."

11:12.755 --> 11:14.715
- Boom! Boom, that's the shit.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.758
Hey, that's good!

11:15.841 --> 11:17.259
All right, all right, all right.
Bad tweet.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.677
I got it, I got it!
I got it!

11:18.761 --> 11:21.013
- Bad tweet. Bad tweet.
-"Kendall Roy
is not a hero, fam."

11:21.097 --> 11:24.642
- Uh... "He's bootleg Ross
with a daddy complex."

11:24.725 --> 11:26.811
- Love it! Love it!

11:26.894 --> 11:28.771
Okay, okay, okay.
Good tweet, good tweet!

11:28.854 --> 11:30.022
Okay, keep 'em comin',
motherfuckers.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.400
"Maybe it's just 'cause
he's murking his shitty dad,

11:32.483 --> 11:35.152
but I kind of wanna fuck
Kendall Roy?"

11:35.236 --> 11:37.655
- Booyah!

11:37.738 --> 11:40.950
- Yeah, girl!

11:41.033 --> 11:43.077
Bad tweet! Bad tweet!
Bad tweet!

11:43.160 --> 11:45.246
Okay. "He clearly
has mental health issues..."

11:45.329 --> 11:48.040
- Right.
-"...and crazy guilt,
coupled with addiction.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.376
That's all this is,
and it's sad."

11:53.546 --> 11:56.173
- Boo!

11:58.384 --> 12:00.803
That one sucked!

12:09.520 --> 12:10.896
Hi.
Hi.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.816
- Happy crowd.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.237
Kendall Roy!

12:18.320 --> 12:19.989
- Should I give 'em something?
- Yeah.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.535
Fuck the patriarchy!

12:24.994 --> 12:26.370
Whoo!

12:29.331 --> 12:30.791
All right,
do we have like a safe word?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.710
Uh--
To get out of here?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.345
Good to see you.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.765
Shiv-fucking-Roy.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.768
Great to see you here.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.104
I always come.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.772
The Committee
for the Protection

12:53.856 --> 12:55.399
and Welfare of Journalists.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.151
You're into that,
but you like to keep them

12:57.234 --> 12:59.236
protected in hutches, correct?

12:59.320 --> 13:01.614
With the little feeding bottles,
kind of like hamsters?

13:01.697 --> 13:03.157
Oh, yeah. Yeah, adorable.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.326
We do keep more newspapers
alive and-- and employ

13:05.409 --> 13:07.578
more journalists worldwide
than any other company,

13:07.661 --> 13:09.663
- so I guess we're doing our bit?
- Uh-huh.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.707
The Soviet Union employed
a ton of journalists, too.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.502
Oh, Nate,
we got to Stalin so fast?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.295
Is Gil still turning up
on Russia Today

13:16.378 --> 13:18.339
- by mistake?
- Hey.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.549
- Hey, man.
Hey, Ken.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.842
- Wow.
- Good to see you.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.178
- It's a family affair.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.387
Yeah, I didn't think
you'd be here.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.389
I thought the newly minted
president

13:27.473 --> 13:29.934
of Waystar Royco
would just be too busy.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.435
- I'm on the advisory.
- Oh, right.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.354
You're the newest
attraction at the zoo,

13:33.437 --> 13:34.897
half man, half Nobel prize?

13:34.980 --> 13:37.441
Sure, Shiv. You got me.

13:38.776 --> 13:42.071
- Well, well, well, Shiv.
- Really nice to see you.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.281
Really.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.746
Hey.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.541
Hey.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.378
So, how is he?

13:57.461 --> 14:00.214
Is he all, like,
angry hog at the state fair?

14:00.297 --> 14:02.091
Rolling in shit,
snapping at kids?

14:03.175 --> 14:06.053
He's fine. He's...

14:06.136 --> 14:07.638
...worried you might come in.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.391
Let him worry.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.434
Okay, well,
that would just be dumb, Ken.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.270
We all need for us
to win the shareholder vote,

14:14.353 --> 14:17.314
you too, so just--
you know, just wait a week.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.650
And maybe cool it
on the interviews

14:19.733 --> 14:20.901
- while you're at it.
- Oh, uh-huh.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.237
- That'd be smart all round.
- Well, yeah, maybe.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.114
I'm not a suicide bomber, Shiv.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.617
Hey, I wanted to say, um...

14:29.493 --> 14:32.705
just... at Rava's?

14:36.500 --> 14:39.336
I think I'm right--
I-- I am right.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.172
But I maybe threw
a couple of ugly rocks.

14:43.882 --> 14:44.883
Uh-huh.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.177
I'm just trying to be...

14:48.053 --> 14:50.681
more thoughtful now, so...

14:52.433 --> 14:54.643
Look, I...

14:54.727 --> 14:58.772
I think we have the same
aim here, is the truth.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.233
You know, big picture.
I'm...

15:01.317 --> 15:03.569
...fucking tired
of all this shit too.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.446
And I'm pushing for change.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.741
Like, is there a world
where you stop being gross

15:08.824 --> 15:12.494
and throwing stones
and we can acknowledge

15:12.578 --> 15:16.749
and rebuild, you know,
truth and reconciliation?

15:16.832 --> 15:19.501
You know, and maybe--
maybe we can actually find a way

15:19.585 --> 15:21.420
to fucking fix things
from the inside,

15:21.503 --> 15:24.131
which is the only place
that anything gets done anyway.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.054
They made you get
all dressed up for this?

15:32.056 --> 15:35.684
Or do you not actually
give a fuck?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.186
And it's all just ego?

15:40.481 --> 15:41.523
Look at this.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.028
It's you now.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.780
Ladies and gentlemen,
to present our next award...

15:47.863 --> 15:48.822
I'm sorry for you, Siobhan.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.367
...a man who is used to
owning the news

15:51.450 --> 15:54.620
rather than being in the news.
Kendall Roy.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.921
So, thanks for making time
and, uh, when we do it,

16:04.004 --> 16:07.007
the first section will just be
the South Asian streaming stuff.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.425
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- We'll have to ask

16:08.509 --> 16:10.010
the shareholder
meeting question.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.720
Very confident.
Massive optimism.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.514
Great.
And then, uh, you know,

16:13.597 --> 16:16.225
I think that you know
that there's this idea
that everyone...

16:16.308 --> 16:18.102
uh, everyone thought
that it'd be really kind of fun

16:18.185 --> 16:20.187
if after everything,
we might, uh, open up the door

16:20.270 --> 16:21.939
on some family stuff
for a little bit.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.233
- No, I know, I know.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.694
And we won't dwell on it, so,
uh, we'll just keep it loose

16:26.777 --> 16:28.278
and, uh, it'll be fun
to freewheel it. Hmm?

16:28.362 --> 16:29.863
Tell me precisely
every single word

16:29.947 --> 16:32.199
they're gonna ask me.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.201
Well, I couldn't disclose
specific questions

16:34.284 --> 16:36.036
because of our policies
at ATN Business

16:36.120 --> 16:39.164
and that would be ethically,
uh, you know...

16:40.624 --> 16:43.085
But it, uh, might be
something like...

16:44.461 --> 16:46.422
"Logan seems
like a business-oriented guy,

16:46.505 --> 16:48.257
what's something special
that you and your dad

16:48.340 --> 16:49.425
enjoy doing together?"

16:49.508 --> 16:53.220
- No, next question.
- Okay, sure.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.180
"What was a time
that your dad came to your aid

16:55.264 --> 16:58.392
- when you really needed him?"
- Mm, no. I'm not doing that one.

16:58.475 --> 17:01.770
Right.
Um...

17:01.854 --> 17:04.022
"What is your most cherished
father-son memory?"

17:05.524 --> 17:07.735
So far, these are bad.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.361
Well, how about, uh--
how about you lead?

17:09.445 --> 17:12.740
Is there some sort of childhood
story that you'd like to tell?

17:12.823 --> 17:16.744
I got a memory
in the old bankiola. Uh...

17:16.827 --> 17:18.579
Some fly-fishing
in Montana, if...

17:19.496 --> 17:21.582
Sure.
-...that interests you.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.791
Thank you, Mr. Roy!

17:25.627 --> 17:28.672
Um... Well,
I will pass that along.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.925
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.845
And I don't want him...

17:34.928 --> 17:38.515
- How you're doing?
- Love and marriage.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.934
I feel another million drain
with every cluck

17:41.018 --> 17:42.478
from that hen house.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.488
Did you see him?
- I did.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.532
- Is he coming in?
- Uh... I don't know.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.618
I don't think so.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.828
- I think he gets it.
- Uh-huh.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.040
Thank you.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.833
You know, every time
I don't see you out there

18:04.917 --> 18:07.711
saying something, I think,
"Does Shiv even like me?"

18:08.921 --> 18:11.924
- Oh, come on, Roman is--
- My daughter.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.718
My only daughter.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.766
What is it exactly
that you want me to do?

18:20.849 --> 18:23.727
I don't know,
draw a circle around him, maybe.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.563
Declare that your old man
isn't some dirty bastard.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.482
Tell the truth, maybe.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.983
- About him.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.736
The truth, but horrible.
and in public, right?

18:33.737 --> 18:34.863
Do you trust me?

18:35.989 --> 18:37.032
Yes, of course.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.620
Uh... On what?

18:41.703 --> 18:45.499
- On all this hullabaloo.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.334
-"Hullabaloo"?
Uh-huh.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.421
Uh... Yeah.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.383
I don't...

18:58.428 --> 18:59.429
Yeah.

19:01.849 --> 19:05.811
- Can we-- I mean, can we talk?
- Yes, we can talk.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.271
Okay, well...

19:08.105 --> 19:10.023
- We're a big company, but...
- Mm-hmm.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.568
...how bad is-- is...

19:14.903 --> 19:17.030
- What is the worst thing
that could be in those papers?
- Not all that bad.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.700
I mean... Um...

19:19.783 --> 19:21.702
Health and safety, compliance.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.620
A few bad apples.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.375
- What?
Well, I know
that isn't true.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.127
Come on, Dad.
Tom worked in Cruises.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.420
Bill told him everything.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.255
And besides, I know
that there were black ops,

19:33.338 --> 19:35.257
and I know that there was
targeted intimidation

19:35.340 --> 19:38.468
of victims and whistleblowers.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.178
The NRPI, for fuck's sake.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.973
Maybe there were
some salty moves.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.559
You can't just change
your story.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.269
I wanna keep you clean.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.438
I put Gerri in,
but I can't trust her.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.523
She's optics. I need you.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.568
Listen.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.196
I didn't know
about any of this shit.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.325
Well, you're on emails.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.577
Do you know how many emails
I get a day?

20:03.660 --> 20:05.037
I don't read my emails.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.080
- I get the action points.
I know.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.917
Shiv, the world
is fucking rough.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.711
We ran a cruise line
out of some tin-pot ports

20:12.794 --> 20:14.880
- registered in bongo
fucking bongo hovels...
- Oh--

20:14.963 --> 20:16.798
...and we poured millions in.
And sure,

20:16.882 --> 20:19.176
did we play rough
with the odd fucking union boss

20:19.259 --> 20:23.513
or some Moaning Minnie
repeat litigant? I don't know!

20:23.597 --> 20:27.476
It was a quarter of
a century ago, a lot of it.

20:27.559 --> 20:31.521
So, yes, I fought
for you and your brothers.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.649
But you will not find
a piece of paper

20:33.732 --> 20:36.276
that makes you
ashamed of me, okay?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.279
Well...

20:39.363 --> 20:41.281
the government
does have an unbelievable amount

20:41.365 --> 20:44.159
of leverage
at its disposal, Dad.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.622
- The law?
- Yeah, the law.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.708
The law is people.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.212
And people is politics.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.131
And I can handle a people.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.594
♪ ("PULL UP" BY ELIJAH "LX"
HARVEY FEAT. J LYNN PLAYS) ♪

21:04.262 --> 21:05.472
Oh, that is nice.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.141
It's just beautiful,
I mean, it's just-- it's--

21:08.225 --> 21:09.601
- It's heavy.
- Isn't it?

21:09.685 --> 21:11.687
I've always been self-conscious
about my wrists,

21:11.770 --> 21:13.522
- so it could address that.
- It's saffron.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.273
You have normal wrists.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.401
Thanks, that is very nice
of you to say.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.652
- That is-- You--

21:18.735 --> 21:19.903
You have some nice
wrists yourself.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.780
Greg, do you think
we can figure this out?

21:21.863 --> 21:23.407
You wanna transfer now?

21:23.490 --> 21:25.200
Um--
- It's 40k.

21:25.283 --> 21:30.497
Oh, no, no, um, I think this is,
uh, like a gift situation.

21:30.580 --> 21:35.419
Hey, Ken! Hey, Ken.
Are you buying this?

21:35.502 --> 21:37.587
- What?
Are you buying him this?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.548
What? The-- The watch? No.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.425
No, I just said
I'd hook you up, dude.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.096
What is that look?
Don't get weird on me.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.015
I'm not your fucking
sugar daddy.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.641
Cheapskate.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.602
No, that's-- that's all good.
I-- I-- I mean, it's 40...

21:52.686 --> 21:53.895
I'm not buying him
a fucking watch.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.564
- What the fuck
is he talking about?

21:55.647 --> 21:57.149
No, I can't.
I'm gonna need to give it back.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.400
- It's not a good time.
No, no, no, no.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.360
- It has your patina now.
- No, I don't have patina.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.737
- We agreed.
- No, I shower.

22:01.820 --> 22:05.490
Shit, she-- she did me again
tonight. Hey, hey, Comfry!

22:05.574 --> 22:07.993
Sophie Iwobi
did me again tonight.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.996
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it. Yeah.

22:11.079 --> 22:13.498
What?
She did a segment.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.375
- Oh, shit.
- Should we do this tomorrow?

22:15.459 --> 22:16.960
- Maybe I could--
-"Oedipussy 2."

22:17.044 --> 22:18.962
- I can get you
some bullet points.
- It looks like she tore me one.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.089
Come on, fuck that.
We gotta-- We gotta watch this.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.427
Hey, guys.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.430
Guys, I'm gonna
put on Sophie Iwobi.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.390
Looks like she--
she tore me one.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.517
Hey, hey, come on, we--
we should watch this,

22:32.601 --> 22:33.643
it'll be fun, here it is.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.188
<i>So, let's turn for a moment
to Kendall Roy.</i>

22:36.271 --> 22:38.148
Woo-hoo!
<i>-My favorite white man.</i>

22:38.231 --> 22:39.399
<i>-Snitchy Rich.</i>

22:39.483 --> 22:41.568
<i>Or as you may know him,
"a jar of mayonnaise</i>

22:41.651 --> 22:44.196
<i>-in a Prada suit."</i>
- Ha! Okay.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.615
<i>Roy tweeted
earlier today...</i>

22:46.698 --> 22:48.408
It's okay,
you can laugh.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.995
<i>The fuck is he
talking about?</i>
- Amen.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.581
<i>That's like your dog
saying, "Hey, guys, guys, guys,</i>

22:54.664 --> 22:56.416
<i>we have to punish
whoever ate coffee grinds</i>

22:56.500 --> 22:59.294
<i>out of the trash
and then shit on the sofa."</i>

22:59.377 --> 23:01.588
<i>-Hashtag Sofa Justice.</i>

23:01.671 --> 23:04.007
That's great.
<i>Actual progressives</i>

23:04.091 --> 23:06.885
<i>have been embracing
this dude. Why?</i>

23:06.968 --> 23:10.222
<i>This is the guy who
told Congress like a month ago</i>

23:10.305 --> 23:13.141
<i>that the investigation
into his father</i>

23:13.225 --> 23:14.309
<i>was a witch hunt.</i>

23:14.392 --> 23:16.645
<i>-And he's also the fail-bro</i>

23:16.728 --> 23:17.896
<i>who once posed in this photo...</i>

23:17.979 --> 23:19.606
Oh, shit.
<i>-...flashing gang signs</i>

23:19.689 --> 23:21.233
<i>-outside of Jean-Georges.</i>

23:21.316 --> 23:23.443
- Okay, that is such a reach.
You were being tongue-in-cheek.
- Yeah.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.112
She fucking loves me.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.114
- She loves me.
<i>-See, the problem is Kendall Roy
suffers from a severe case...</i>

23:27.197 --> 23:29.616
- This is love, it's all love.
<i>-...of what doctors call
Caucasian Rich Brain.</i>

23:29.699 --> 23:30.826
Oh!

23:30.909 --> 23:32.953
<i>What happens
is genetically inherited wealth</i>

23:33.036 --> 23:35.455
<i>and whiteness cause
neural pathways in the brain</i>

23:35.539 --> 23:38.291
<i>to constrict and make
the patient believe he's woke,</i>

23:38.375 --> 23:40.418
<i>when he's just
a total fucking jackass.</i>

23:43.296 --> 23:45.340
- I feel like I should go on.
<i>Fuck Kendall Roy.
Thank you.</i>

23:45.423 --> 23:47.509
- What do you think? Can you
touch base? I should go on.
- I think we should talk to Berry

23:47.592 --> 23:48.969
'cause there's a couple ways
to counter backlash,

23:49.052 --> 23:51.513
- and it might not be the best--
- Backlash? This is, like...

23:51.596 --> 23:53.723
This is not--
- This is being
in the conversation.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.892
Yeah.
- This is fucking great.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.436
- This is great.
Yeah.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.815
- Hey.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.234
- Shivy!
Oh, hi.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.652
- Hey.
- How was your guy?

24:05.735 --> 24:07.737
- Did you see him?
Yup.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.990
Yeah. When I got in...

24:10.073 --> 24:13.201
uh, Mondale had eaten
some of your pantyhose

24:13.285 --> 24:14.953
and I had to pull 'em
out of his ass.

24:15.036 --> 24:16.997
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.167
You shouldn't leave them
lying around the floor, Siobhan.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.002
Not once the help have gone.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.881
Yeah, I-- You okay?

24:25.964 --> 24:29.384
Mondale's not well.
Mondale's unsettled.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.764
Is, uh, Kendall coming
into Waystar?

24:35.765 --> 24:37.767
I don't think so. Uh...

24:39.227 --> 24:40.562
How-- How was your guy?

24:40.645 --> 24:42.230
- How was my guy?
Mm-hmm.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.524
Well, um...

24:45.859 --> 24:47.611
Well...

24:47.694 --> 24:50.071
Yeah, we-- I outlined
what might have happened

24:50.155 --> 24:52.157
to a theoretical John Doe,

24:52.240 --> 24:54.117
- divisional head.
- Mm-hmm.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.995
And, you know,
we talked about...

24:57.078 --> 24:58.872
if what comes out
does come out

24:58.955 --> 25:01.541
in terms of the investigation,
and he said...

25:04.044 --> 25:05.837
"It's very difficult
to see a world

25:05.921 --> 25:08.715
in which this John Doe
doesn't go to jail."

25:09.716 --> 25:12.969
- So...
- Right. Fuck.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.351
- Tom, it'll be okay.
Um...

25:20.852 --> 25:22.896
And what evidence
do you have for that?

25:23.563 --> 25:26.191
I'm curious.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.736
Tom, oh, honey?

25:31.112 --> 25:33.073
I did have one dumb idea.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.075
Mm-hmm?

25:35.158 --> 25:37.619
Yeah. I was thinking,
you know, maybe...

25:37.702 --> 25:40.747
maybe it would be good
to get out in front of it.

25:40.830 --> 25:44.584
If prison is likely,
could I find any...

25:45.710 --> 25:47.337
benefit in that, you know?

25:48.922 --> 25:51.633
- You mean cooperate?
- No, not with DOJ.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.718
Your dad.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.888
I go to your dad and I-- I...

25:56.972 --> 25:59.474
offer myself up
as the beating post.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.895
Uh... No, honey. You can't.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.648
No.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.858
- Honey, you're drunk.
Mm.

26:16.032 --> 26:17.325
But it is smart.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.829
Yeah, it's, uh, kind of a...

26:21.830 --> 26:23.748
a win from a no-win.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.167
You think?
- Yeah. I mean, it's punchy.

26:27.752 --> 26:28.878
I mean...

26:28.962 --> 26:32.340
you know, it's very likely
that no one goes to prison.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.384
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
And...

26:34.467 --> 26:38.680
either way,
you bank gold with my dad.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.309
The offer is kinda... genius.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.939
All being well, you know,
with a fair wind, I could

26:48.023 --> 26:50.191
- be done in less than a year.
- Mm-hmm.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.988
But no.
You can't, Tom.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.657
Jesus. Everyone is doing
fucking somersaults for him

26:57.741 --> 26:58.867
right now.

my office is ready.

27:45.455 --> 27:46.998
I'll ping you before I arrive.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.418
Good? Good? Great.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.253
Greg.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.506
Yo. Hey, I'm going in.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.759
Yeah, I might wanna roll deep,
so, uh...

27:58.885 --> 28:00.678
...just keep it
on the down-low, okay?

28:00.762 --> 28:02.430
I wanna see the shockwaves.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.432
November just around the corner,
very important election...

28:04.516 --> 28:06.684
- Hi.
-...with Michelle-Anne...

28:06.768 --> 28:09.312
Shouldn't be too long now.
Uh-huh.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.153
Yeah, because I've--
I've been, uh-- I've been...

28:18.571 --> 28:21.658
I've been thinking, um,
about what it is that you...

28:22.617 --> 28:24.411
you might really need
right now...

28:24.494 --> 28:27.997
and, um-- and how I can help.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.583
- Mm-hmm?
- Yeah.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.628
Yeah, because, you know,
if, uh-- if things go...

28:34.462 --> 28:36.381
how they could go...

28:36.464 --> 28:39.259
maybe there's no repercussions,
but if not...

28:40.343 --> 28:42.804
there'll probably
be a cash number.

28:42.887 --> 28:46.307
And there will probably
need to be a face or two

28:46.391 --> 28:48.726
behind bars, right?

28:51.855 --> 28:54.566
- What's your angle, Tom?
- No. None.

28:54.649 --> 28:57.277
None, just-- just, uh...

28:57.360 --> 29:01.531
I'm probably in the firing line.
And I just wanted you to know...

29:03.032 --> 29:04.701
if you need to strategize...

29:06.035 --> 29:07.454
I can be that guy.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.082
I'll-- I'll step up and go down.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.297
That's it?

29:18.923 --> 29:20.592
- You don't mind?
- Nope.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.929
No, that's just there.
If you need it.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.933
I won't wriggle.

29:29.017 --> 29:32.312
Just clonk the trout on the head
and put it in your pouch.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.440
It won't come to that.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.067
But...

29:40.445 --> 29:43.281
thank you, Tom. Thank you.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.576
Not a problem.

29:46.659 --> 29:48.036
...helping us
to get our message out

29:48.119 --> 29:49.996
to Latino voters,
who've really come around

29:50.079 --> 29:51.498
to the President's message

29:51.581 --> 29:52.665
and, you know,

29:52.749 --> 29:54.918
we saw Boyer on your program
a few nights ago.

29:56.794 --> 29:59.214
Absolutely.
Very much with the president,
so...

30:22.987 --> 30:24.614
<i>Bergman, Hendon, and Weiss.</i>

30:24.697 --> 30:27.992
Uh... Hello. Uh... Hi.
Uh... I was given your number

30:28.076 --> 30:31.704
by a friend of mine and I--
I was wanting to, um--

30:31.788 --> 30:32.997
I would like to...

30:33.081 --> 30:35.875
schedule an appointment
with Rex Hendon.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.460
<i>This is for a consultation?</i>

30:37.544 --> 30:39.420
- Uh-huh. That's right.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.381
Excuse me, can you hold
the line one second?

30:43.341 --> 30:44.634
Greg, talk fast. What is it?

30:44.717 --> 30:46.010
<i>Hey, so-- so...</i>
- I'm busy.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.555
<i>...I have something
that you guys might wanna know.</i>

30:54.310 --> 30:59.065
- Hey! How you doin'?
- Great. Are you...

30:59.148 --> 31:01.067
- What are you doing down here?
- Mark, isn't he just

31:01.150 --> 31:03.111
- the fucking greatest?
- Sure, yeah.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.238
As ever.
Great to have you contribute.

31:05.321 --> 31:08.116
Could we do five
on what we need to do here?

31:08.199 --> 31:09.284
Sure.

31:10.868 --> 31:14.539
So, how are things?
Look at you, the tough guy.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.916
You wouldn't even take service
of a subpoena, right?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.794
Yeah, my son stands up,
waves his dick in the air,

31:19.877 --> 31:22.130
and the rest of the world
is meant to rearrange itself

31:22.213 --> 31:25.550
according to his liking?
I don't think so, right?

31:25.633 --> 31:27.719
I see. But are you gonna
get more cooperative...

31:27.802 --> 31:30.305
- Oh! It's a witch hunt.
-...now that you've
set the table?

31:30.388 --> 31:32.348
The prosecutors
are gonna regret any time

31:32.432 --> 31:34.267
or money they spend on it.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.273
- What does the old man think?
- Not fucking much.

31:42.483 --> 31:43.776
No, he's got--
he's got poll numbers

31:43.860 --> 31:46.070
dancing in front of his eyes
morning, noon, and night.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.198
So, someone shits in Wisconsin,

31:49.282 --> 31:51.618
he's worried it'll float down
the Mississippi

31:51.701 --> 31:53.453
and hurt his numbers in Iowa.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.830
Relax.
We've got his back.

31:56.623 --> 31:57.665
Yeah, well...

31:59.083 --> 32:01.502
That's great. I guess...

32:03.254 --> 32:04.422
you know, when this thing broke,

32:04.505 --> 32:07.800
the whole thing was,
"Logan Roy is going down."

32:07.884 --> 32:10.094
But then you got this thing,
some of our folks are like,

32:10.178 --> 32:11.429
"There's no way
Roy is going down.

32:11.512 --> 32:12.972
The President's gonna
protect him,

32:13.056 --> 32:14.849
the system is broken."

32:14.932 --> 32:16.934
People have no idea.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.395
They have these
paranoid fantasies.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.439
Yeah.

32:22.732 --> 32:25.818
I don't want you to do anything.

32:25.902 --> 32:29.947
- Right.
- What I want is-- is nothing.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.033
Normal consideration,

32:32.116 --> 32:34.994
not to become the focus
of some bullshit.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.829
- Right.
Not favors.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.874
- Right.
- Right, right, right,
right, right...

32:41.000 --> 32:42.377
- What?

32:42.460 --> 32:46.255
The fact is, I don't want
anything from anyone.

32:46.339 --> 32:49.550
That's not the way I operate.
But I would like to know

32:49.634 --> 32:53.888
that no one's gonna shit
their pants if I hang tough.

32:53.971 --> 32:56.057
Facebook is full of photos
of you and the boss

32:56.140 --> 32:58.101
at CPAC and Davos.

32:58.184 --> 33:00.478
All the nice things
you've said about each other?

33:01.604 --> 33:03.815
It hits a demographic
we have to worry about.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.277
If that raisin
hangs me out to dry,

33:08.361 --> 33:10.780
I'm quite willing
to do the same to him.

33:11.948 --> 33:14.033
Well, if we're gonna be real...

33:14.117 --> 33:16.119
maybe the President
has not been feeling

33:16.202 --> 33:18.496
like your coverage
has been very helpful

33:18.579 --> 33:20.081
or truthful lately.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.667
It could get a lot
fucking worse.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.256
We have the same interest here.

33:30.883 --> 33:34.762
Can you lower the temperature?
And I'll see what I can do.

33:34.846 --> 33:38.683
- Sure. That's all I need.

33:40.643 --> 33:41.894
Excuse me.

33:41.978 --> 33:45.398
So, we asked everyone
to submit concerns and questions

33:45.481 --> 33:47.608
anonymously via the Intranet...

33:47.692 --> 33:49.777
...which has some drawbacks,
as you know,

33:49.861 --> 33:52.029
and we wanted you
to be aware, Shiv,

33:52.113 --> 33:53.823
if you're gonna be up there.
So, we plan to put these

33:53.906 --> 33:56.242
- on, um, a screen.
- What are they asking?

33:56.325 --> 33:58.911
Well, uh, the general tenor is,

33:58.995 --> 34:01.789
"What the hell's
happening here?" Uh...

34:01.873 --> 34:05.668
A lot of those. Uh... Also,
"I'm embarrassed to say

34:05.752 --> 34:08.129
to my mother I work at
Waystar. Any advice?"

34:08.212 --> 34:10.131
Yeah, fuck your mother.
-"Please tell us anything at all

34:10.214 --> 34:11.674
about what is happening here."

34:11.758 --> 34:13.843
Oh, my God, did they write
these questions in crayon?

34:13.926 --> 34:15.261
I mean,
I have my speech all set.

34:15.344 --> 34:16.929
Do we even really need
to have questions?

34:17.013 --> 34:19.932
Well, we did say we wanted
to answer questions,

34:20.016 --> 34:20.975
- so...
- Yeah.

34:21.058 --> 34:23.352
Okay, well,
Dad can't see this one,

34:23.436 --> 34:24.562
or this one.

34:25.229 --> 34:26.397
Oh, fuck, no.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.149
- This'll make him shit
his Pop-Tarts.
No, no.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.234
- I think there's, like,
three here we can use.
Okay.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.028
Three is all we need.
- This is just fucking rude.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.446
I mean, it's not even
really a question.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.281
I mean, I don't think people
should even be thinking this

34:35.364 --> 34:36.407
- that work here.
- You're right.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.533
Can we get different questions?

34:37.617 --> 34:38.951
- Like, less questiony questions?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.286
'Cause these are just
fucking horrible.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.954
We can.
Okay, well,
Hugo and I

34:42.038 --> 34:43.706
- did prepare a set
of questions...
- Something else.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.124
...that are more
of the sort of things

34:45.208 --> 34:47.001
that people would actually
wanna know.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.252
Yeah. I mean...
- Great.

34:48.336 --> 34:51.547
...these, we feel, are people's
real questions, okay?

34:51.631 --> 34:53.758
We've got a problem.
Logan wants to see you

34:53.841 --> 34:55.676
- in his office.
Now?

34:58.638 --> 35:00.515
<i>Hello?</i>
- Lisa.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.850
Lisa! The Regal Legal Eagle.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.062
<i>Kendall, I hear
you're going in. What the fuck?</i>

35:06.145 --> 35:08.564
Yeah, I can't let him dominate
the battle space, Lisa.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.651
My sister's making moves,
I can't just watch it happen.

35:11.734 --> 35:13.820
What-- What-- What--
What's the story on my immunity?

35:13.903 --> 35:16.823
<i>I'm figuring out
a "Queen for a Day" situation,
Kendall.</i>

35:16.906 --> 35:19.033
<i>-I have to have control here.</i>
- Yeah, but we're losing
the momentum.

35:19.116 --> 35:20.326
Can we get a raid?
What about a raid?

35:20.409 --> 35:22.286
- Can we get a raid?
<i>We can't "get" anything.</i>

35:22.370 --> 35:26.707
No, sure, but really? I mean,
we hit the right buttons.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.460
"Has the government
gone soft-cock on Big Corp?"

35:29.544 --> 35:32.797
I'll call you in 40, Lisa.
You're the boss here. Bye.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.551
And let's commit to Iwobi.
Yeah? Let's do it. Reach out.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.678
Call Noah and get me some jokes.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.721
Not jokes.
Like, funny as fuck shit,

35:40.805 --> 35:43.224
but not in a stupid jokey way.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.227
- Is it true? He's on his way?
- Fucking rat.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.771
I'm gonna jam a Montblanc
down his fucking throat.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.731
- He'll eat up any drama, Dad.
- Kerry!

35:50.815 --> 35:53.317
Look, why don't we just let him
come on in and ignore him?

35:53.401 --> 35:55.319
Get us Colin,
get us building services.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.363
If he comes for me,
I want him fucking cuffed.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.906
- Okay.
He's fired!

35:58.990 --> 36:02.660
HR is discussing him
stepping down from his duties.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.663
But firing, you would be handing
DOJ a gas can.

36:05.746 --> 36:07.540
- Yeah.
It would be
a PR disaster.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.166
Want me to get outside counsel
on the line?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.459
Front desk says he's pulling up.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.752
I don't want people
seeing him.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.713
- Keep him the fuck out!
- Okay.

36:23.723 --> 36:24.849
How are you?

36:27.184 --> 36:30.730
- Sir, I'm-- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

36:30.813 --> 36:33.774
Just-- Your key card
has expired.

36:35.067 --> 36:37.486
Expired? That's weird.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.448
Hi, Kendall. Uh...
Bit of a crazy morning here.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.199
- Oh, is it?
- If you like, we could head over

36:42.283 --> 36:44.327
to 43 North
and I can fill you in.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.995
Might be a little bit
more comfortable there.

36:46.078 --> 36:47.914
Yeah, not going
to the satellite office, thanks.

36:47.997 --> 36:50.541
Uh... My card doesn't work,
so I'm just gonna

36:50.625 --> 36:52.460
hurdle the gates
and have Remi film it.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.545
What? No, who's--
How about we go up with you?

36:54.629 --> 36:55.796
We go up together?
We'll swipe you in.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.548
You guys wanna sync up?
'Cause they-- they--

36:57.632 --> 36:59.467
- He can't go up.
No, he can go up.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.010
They've told us he can't go up.

37:01.093 --> 37:03.471
Sorry, who's "they"?
We can't authorize that.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.307
I can authorize that.
I am authorizing that.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.477
We probably can't keep him
out of the town hall, correct?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.687
<i>You can discourage him
from attending</i>

37:11.771 --> 37:12.980
<i>in light of his position.</i>

37:13.064 --> 37:15.316
Can we discourage him
with a taser shot

37:15.399 --> 37:17.944
directly to his peni
or scrummage sacking?

37:18.027 --> 37:19.278
He's headed
for the freight.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.697
Fine. Bring him up
in the dumbwaiter

37:21.781 --> 37:23.699
like a fucking hamburger.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.202
All right,
what's up, bro?
Hey.

37:26.285 --> 37:29.080
- Doing the heavy lifting?
- Yeah.

37:29.163 --> 37:31.415
Is he there?
- I don't see him yet.

37:31.499 --> 37:35.670
- With his stupid walk.
- Tom, get Sam and Ray and IT,

37:35.753 --> 37:38.589
and make sure he doesn't get
fucking cute with IT.

37:42.551 --> 37:43.678
Hey, man.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.310

Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

37:54.522 --> 37:57.358
Kinda weird, right?
It's pretty weird.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.193
- But, you know, yeah.
How's it going?

37:59.277 --> 38:01.445
Yeah, life goes on,
you know, yeah.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.530
- Buddhists?
Hmm.

38:02.613 --> 38:05.408
Nice. Life does go on.

38:05.491 --> 38:09.245
So-- So, what's going on
back there in my dad's office?

38:09.328 --> 38:12.123
He got any back-channel
White House contacts in there
or what?

38:14.917 --> 38:17.712
- I'm joking. You can't
tell me that.
Right. Right, right.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.256
And do you have an immunity deal
with DOJ?

38:21.298 --> 38:23.509
Do you?

38:23.592 --> 38:25.553
It's good
we can kid around

38:25.636 --> 38:26.804
- like this.
- Yeah.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.517
But look, man. You're actually
in a difficult spot.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.270
You know, it's-- it's no fun

38:34.353 --> 38:35.479

38:58.002 --> 39:00.004

68? You like it?

No fucking way, this is like...

39:36.165 --> 39:38.709
sixty-five, sixty-two.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.419

a little cool.

the town hall start?

BY NICHOLAS BRITELL PLAYS) ♪

44:09.480 --> 44:10.856
Hey, Ken.
- Hey.

44:19.740 --> 44:20.783
Thanks.

44:24.286 --> 44:26.205
Are we close? What time is it?

44:26.288 --> 44:28.207
Oh, what time is it?
Oh, it's, uh--

44:28.290 --> 44:29.666
it's like the 18th century
or something,

44:29.750 --> 44:32.544
- when watches didn't work.
Doesn't work?

44:32.628 --> 44:34.296
- No.
Why did you get it?

44:35.255 --> 44:38.759
Why did I get it?
You encouraged me.

44:38.842 --> 44:40.386
You don't remember this?
You shrugged at me

44:40.469 --> 44:41.678
- like it was reasonable.
- This one's good.

44:41.762 --> 44:43.514
Not if it doesn't work.
It's-- It's fine,

44:43.597 --> 44:45.516
it's okay. I--
I'm a humble custodian now.

44:45.599 --> 44:46.934
A piece like this
will often have to go

44:47.017 --> 44:48.268
to Switzerland for six months.

44:48.352 --> 44:50.437
So, I have this funny bit
about how for the special

44:50.521 --> 44:51.605
- committee of the board...
- Hmm.

44:51.688 --> 44:53.232
...and the-- the white shoe firm
that will handle

44:53.315 --> 44:55.275
the investigation,
how my dad's putting pressure

44:55.359 --> 44:57.778
to hire a firm
that will help them cover up.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.238
Do you hear anything?
- Yeah.

44:59.321 --> 45:00.489
Really?
- Yeah.

45:00.572 --> 45:01.907
- I don't think its broken.
-...Cover Up--

45:01.990 --> 45:03.450
- Cover Up "R" Us.
Hmm.

45:03.534 --> 45:04.701
Like Toys "R" Us.

45:04.785 --> 45:06.370
-"Cover up our ass."
- Yeah.

45:06.453 --> 45:07.913
- No?

45:07.996 --> 45:09.123
I don't know.
- No?

45:09.206 --> 45:12.209
But I think that
the Love Boat vids are good.

45:12.292 --> 45:13.335
Yeah, Love Boat...

45:13.419 --> 45:14.795
Hey, uh, because we pushed
taping for you,

45:14.878 --> 45:16.046
we're still filling up
the audience,

45:16.130 --> 45:17.381
but shouldn't be too long.

45:17.464 --> 45:19.007
- Cool.
- Do you guys need anything?

45:19.091 --> 45:21.802
- We're great, thank you.
- Are you okay?

45:21.885 --> 45:23.679
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.
- He's just jerking off

45:23.762 --> 45:24.847
his invisible friend.

45:24.930 --> 45:27.099
No.
- Hey, so, where are
the writers at?

45:27.182 --> 45:28.684
Um... Generally,
writers and guests--

45:28.767 --> 45:31.311
Oh, no, generally, but I knew
a guy at the Lampoon
who knows Dylan.

45:31.395 --> 45:34.481
Can I just find him to say hi?
I might pitch a couple of areas
for the gigglebots?

45:34.565 --> 45:35.899
Oh, well, we don't really
have time.

45:35.983 --> 45:38.110
- We gotta kind of get up there.
- It's cool, I'll find him.

45:40.696 --> 45:42.698
Hey, Rome! How you doin'?

45:42.781 --> 45:44.116
I've just been on TV,

45:44.199 --> 45:46.994
waxing lyrical about me
and Dad out murdering trout

45:47.077 --> 45:50.581
and singing sea shanties
around the old marshmallow hole.

45:50.664 --> 45:53.375
- Have you read this thing?
Now, I talked Dad down.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.586
He wanted us all to appear
on a talk show.

45:55.669 --> 45:57.129
Get the fuck outta here.

45:57.212 --> 45:59.673
Sitting on a couch together,
I thought would be very gauche.

45:59.756 --> 46:03.343
So I drafted this to land
and to end debate.

46:03.427 --> 46:07.014
- He wants us all to sign it.
- Man, this is quite a rich brew.

46:07.097 --> 46:08.849
Well, I think
a formal response

46:08.932 --> 46:11.351
really draws a line under it.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.604
I'm sure you're being asked,
so this is just us

46:13.687 --> 46:15.105
very clearly saying
that we're not a part

46:15.189 --> 46:18.066
- of Kendall's thing.
Mm-hmm. Uh...

46:18.150 --> 46:20.569
What? You would
have to say it's accurate.

46:20.652 --> 46:22.863
Yeah, accurate like Oswald
was accurate.

46:22.946 --> 46:25.365
I want us all to sign it
for release to media tonight.

46:25.908 --> 46:27.743
Ooh! Um...

46:28.827 --> 46:31.288
I mean, it's kind of...

46:32.414 --> 46:34.666
It's kind of
a greeting card from hell.

46:34.750 --> 46:35.751
What?

46:35.834 --> 46:38.253
It's a Times New Roman
firing squad.

46:38.337 --> 46:41.798
Yeah, it's... pretty horrible,
you know.

46:41.882 --> 46:45.469
Well... ...it's all,
basically verified, so--

46:45.552 --> 46:50.390
Well, yeah, drug addict,
serial liar, absentee father.

46:50.474 --> 46:53.185
History of his own problematic
relationships with women.

46:53.268 --> 46:54.311
Which of those isn't true?

46:54.394 --> 46:55.938
No, it's accurate,
you know,

46:56.021 --> 46:59.316
but this would be out there.
Like, forever.

46:59.399 --> 47:02.027
You know, PGN pulls up
that photo of me with a ponytail

47:02.110 --> 47:04.238
any time they wanna
make me look untrustworthy.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.698
Okay, look,
Kendall is on a mission.

47:06.782 --> 47:09.076
And he's not going to stop
unless we take his legs out.

47:09.159 --> 47:11.703
And did Dad want
for all of us to do this?

47:11.787 --> 47:14.039
It's more powerful if it comes
from all three of us.

47:17.084 --> 47:18.919
- Oh, you're full of shit. Um--
What?

47:19.002 --> 47:21.672
- I'm-- I'm not signing this.
- Roman! Why not?

47:21.755 --> 47:25.425
Because I don't want to.
It makes me feel unwell.

47:25.509 --> 47:28.011
He taught me how to aim
my pee-pee in the toilet.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.805
The fuck?
That's not a reason, Roman.

47:29.888 --> 47:32.432
Take me to reason court
and fucking sue me.

47:32.516 --> 47:34.977
Roman, we all have to do things
we don't want to sometimes.

47:35.060 --> 47:38.814
I-- I just don't-- This is not
in my best interests, so, no.

47:41.525 --> 47:42.442
Connor?

47:42.526 --> 47:44.319
Well, I don't want
to be a bitch,

47:44.403 --> 47:46.822
but my signature
is valuable real estate

47:46.905 --> 47:48.699
and I'm not giving it away
for free.

47:48.782 --> 47:50.993
Okay. What do you want?

47:51.076 --> 47:53.537
I would like
some consideration.

47:53.620 --> 47:56.373
I would like some suck-suck
on my dicky-dick.

47:56.456 --> 47:58.584
Oh, my God.
Same.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.877
I'm feeling brutally
un-suck-sucked right now.

48:00.961 --> 48:02.504
You're babies!

48:02.588 --> 48:04.089
Take my name off, please.

48:04.172 --> 48:06.008
Ooh.
Fine, I'll do it myself.

48:06.091 --> 48:08.135
Thanks for all the fucking help
as always.

48:09.511 --> 48:12.222
Um... It's so good
to see so many of you

48:12.306 --> 48:15.392
here to-- tonight, uh,
our amazing advertisers,

48:15.475 --> 48:16.852
and, you know,
we'd be nothing without you,

48:16.935 --> 48:19.938
and I just wanna say to you all,
whatever is happening

48:20.022 --> 48:22.232
up in the clouds, where the gods

48:22.316 --> 48:23.609
play a little rough
and tumble,

48:23.692 --> 48:28.113
down here, it is very much,
uh, business as usual, so...

48:28.196 --> 48:31.074
Here's to you.
Here's to weathering the storm.

48:32.701 --> 48:35.412
Yeah, like, that's--
that's closer to the idea...

48:35.495 --> 48:37.456
Here they are!

48:37.539 --> 48:39.791
- Oh.
- The geniuses at work!

48:39.875 --> 48:41.501
Clickety-clack, clickety-clack.

48:41.585 --> 48:42.753
Okay. Hello.
- Dylan.

48:42.836 --> 48:44.963
- Yeah?
- Yeah, hey, I-- I knew Pat
at the Lampoon.

48:45.047 --> 48:46.340
- Oh, okay.
- He says you're, like,

48:46.423 --> 48:48.175
- a super funny dude.
- Oh, well...

48:48.258 --> 48:50.719
Yeah. No, you are. I mean, hey,
I-- I just wanted to drop by

48:50.802 --> 48:53.513
and let you guys know
you do awesome work,

48:53.597 --> 48:55.557
very smart, very satirical.

48:55.641 --> 48:57.351
Cool. Thanks, man.
Yeah, yeah.

48:57.434 --> 48:59.853
Hey, I just-- I just--
Listen, I want you guys

48:59.936 --> 49:00.937
- to hit me.
- Yes.

49:01.021 --> 49:03.273
Just Rickles the fuck
out of Oedipussy here.

49:03.357 --> 49:06.109
- I can take it.
- Well, it's just the show, so.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.070
- Yeah, yeah. It's the show.

49:08.153 --> 49:09.488
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:09.571 --> 49:10.989
- Ken, could I grab you
for a second?
- These are the writers.

49:11.073 --> 49:12.532
Hi!
Dylan, my man.

49:12.616 --> 49:13.659
- Oh.
Hurt me!

49:13.742 --> 49:15.577
- Fucking hurt me.
Ken! Ken! Please.

49:16.745 --> 49:17.788
Jesus Christ.

49:17.871 --> 49:19.122
- I'm not sure how...
What's up?

49:19.206 --> 49:21.541
...wide this has gone,
I'm just seeing it now, but...

49:21.625 --> 49:23.168
- Okay.
-...you should...

49:27.798 --> 49:29.591
Whoa! Uh... Okay.

49:29.675 --> 49:31.009
Yeah.
- So...

49:33.845 --> 49:37.557
So, wha-- wha-- what do I--
what do we do with this?

49:37.641 --> 49:40.018
Because this is actually
really sort of nothing.

49:40.102 --> 49:41.478
- Well...
- I think.

49:42.688 --> 49:44.439
- Yeah?
- Uh...

49:44.523 --> 49:45.691
No, I wouldn't say it's nothing.

49:45.774 --> 49:48.151
Wow,
that's below the belt.

49:48.235 --> 49:51.196
Is the world seeing this,
or-- or just... basically us?

49:51.279 --> 49:53.156
- Yeah, the whole world.
- Uh-huh?

49:53.782 --> 49:54.616
Mm-hmm.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.368
Can we ask them
not to use it tonight?

49:56.451 --> 49:57.786
- Will they mention it?
- I think they'll--

49:57.869 --> 50:00.872
- they'll probably mention it.
- But they-- But it's private.

50:00.956 --> 50:04.084
- I feel like--
- Yeah, but it's not private.

50:05.669 --> 50:07.504
- No. Okay.
- No.

50:07.587 --> 50:10.465
I mean, can I still go on?
I feel like I still go on,

50:10.841 --> 50:12.300
right?

50:12.384 --> 50:14.094
- Yeah, no, I think it's--

50:14.177 --> 50:15.721
- I think it's fine.
Yeah.

50:15.804 --> 50:18.181
It's just the kind of thing
where we just maybe
steer away from it.

50:18.265 --> 50:20.350
Uh-huh? Uh--
- You know, we--

50:20.434 --> 50:23.437
Here. Um... Right, so...

50:23.520 --> 50:25.105
- My concern is that it might--
- Yeah.

50:25.188 --> 50:27.607
It might be weird
if we don't mention it.

50:27.691 --> 50:30.026
Sure. Uh-huh. Absolutely.

50:30.110 --> 50:33.739
Okay, good. Look,
it is big of you to come here.

50:33.822 --> 50:35.490
- We wanna be fair.
- Totally.

50:35.574 --> 50:36.616
- And I'm game.

50:36.700 --> 50:38.910
- Okay, that's great.
- Yeah, there's just, uh,

50:38.994 --> 50:41.663
you know, a possibility,
with all the legal of it

50:41.747 --> 50:44.416
that I might have to bow out,
but-- but we're good.

50:44.499 --> 50:46.168
- We're good.
Right.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.462
Um...

50:48.545 --> 50:50.380
We tape in 15 minutes.

50:50.464 --> 50:51.965
Sure, no, and I'd help
with that, obviously.

50:52.048 --> 50:54.384
Right, how--
how would you help with that?

50:54.468 --> 50:55.844
Uh... I know people.

50:55.927 --> 50:58.346
You--
You're gonna what, call Jay-Z?

50:58.430 --> 51:00.474
- And-- And get him
to do the show in 15 minutes?
- Yeah.

51:00.557 --> 51:02.559
- A name. I can do that.
No, no...

51:02.642 --> 51:04.144
I think
you're overthinking this.

51:04.227 --> 51:06.188
It's a comedy show.
We're gonna--

51:06.271 --> 51:07.856
We're gonna have fun and--

51:07.939 --> 51:10.984
Sophie is tough,
but she's fair. And-- And--

51:11.067 --> 51:14.446
- You're-- You're a guest.
- No, I know. You're right.

51:14.529 --> 51:16.656
Yeah.
So, we're-- we're good?

51:16.740 --> 51:18.116
Okay, yeah,
no, for sure.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.701
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:19.785 --> 51:20.786
Great.

52:59.801 --> 53:00.802
Hey!

53:03.972 --> 53:05.098
Hey.

53:05.181 --> 53:07.934
- What are you in for?
Uh... Me? Just...

53:08.018 --> 53:11.104
running some numbers
with Gerri on, you know,

53:11.187 --> 53:14.065
the fucking...
getting the distribution deals

53:14.149 --> 53:15.817
for these--
Fuck it, it's murder.

53:15.901 --> 53:20.739
Good kid.
- Yeah. Uh-huh. Um...

53:20.822 --> 53:23.825
But sorry about the letter
or whatever, I--

53:23.909 --> 53:27.704
- Keeping your nose out, huh?
- Well, I don't know, I guess.

53:27.787 --> 53:29.414
Smart cookie, huh?

53:29.497 --> 53:31.416
Smart little fucking cookie, eh?

53:31.499 --> 53:33.460
Well, you know.

53:33.543 --> 53:36.129
I, uh,
saw your little interview.

53:36.212 --> 53:38.173
Oh, right, yeah,
we don't have to--

53:38.256 --> 53:40.884
"Ooh! I wuv my daddy."

53:40.967 --> 53:43.970
Yeah.

53:44.054 --> 53:45.639
I never figured you
for a faggot.

53:45.722 --> 53:46.890
Oh, wow.

53:46.973 --> 53:49.100
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.
- I know.

53:49.184 --> 53:52.520
So, what's this, uh...
fishing thing?

53:53.480 --> 53:55.148
I don't remember.

53:55.231 --> 53:57.233
Oh, yeah, that was, uh,
Connor, actually.

53:57.317 --> 54:00.403
Connor took me on that.
But, you know...

54:00.487 --> 54:03.114
single, multi-use,
happy childhood memory,

54:03.198 --> 54:04.574
so, yeah.

54:06.409 --> 54:09.287
<i>Oh, my God.
Such sad news. Guess what?</i>

54:09.371 --> 54:10.455

<i>of my brother.</i>

54:34.437 --> 54:36.481
<i>Our entire family
has supported him</i>

54:36.564 --> 54:39.317
<i>through his many attempts
at rehabilitation</i>

54:39.401 --> 54:41.236
<i>for his multiple addictions.</i>

54:41.319 --> 54:44.656
<i>But the events of the last days
have made it clear</i>

54:44.739 --> 54:47.951
<i>that our hopes for his recovery
were misplaced.</i>

54:48.034 --> 54:51.287
<i>I've now been a direct witness
to his misogynistic rants</i>

54:51.371 --> 54:54.082
<i>and comparisons to world
historical figures</i>

54:54.165 --> 54:56.209
<i>that were suggestive
of grandiose</i>

54:56.292 --> 54:57.669
<i>and disordered thinking.</i>

54:57.752 --> 54:59.587
<i>And I would ask
that people give my brother</i>

54:59.671 --> 55:04.217
<i>privacy and consideration
during this difficult time."</i>

55:04.300 --> 55:06.886
<i>And that's from
his sister,</i>

55:06.970 --> 55:08.930
<i>and she's the fucking nice one.</i>

55:16.021 --> 55:19.691
- The FBI is downstairs.
- What?

55:19.774 --> 55:21.693
- Yeah.
- Tell them to fuck off.

55:21.776 --> 55:23.695
Yeah, these are the ones
who don't fuck off.

55:23.778 --> 55:24.904
This is a search warrant.

55:24.988 --> 55:26.573
What do they do
at the front desk?

55:26.656 --> 55:28.199
What are we doing?
They're at the gates.

55:28.283 --> 55:31.494
Uh... Can we call
southern district? Get Leo!
Get, get, get, get, get!

55:31.578 --> 55:33.038
Okay, okay, okay.

55:33.121 --> 55:35.248
Can we stall 'em?
Shall I call Michelle-Anne?

55:35.331 --> 55:37.375
No, I think that the Deputy
Attorney General

55:37.459 --> 55:39.294
got spooked by you
talking to Michelle-Anne.

55:39.377 --> 55:41.212
Well, what the fuck
did Michelle-Anne do?

55:41.296 --> 55:42.547
She's got no fucking acumen!

55:42.630 --> 55:44.507
Well, I guess the Government
isn't a fucking Pez dispenser.

55:44.591 --> 55:46.092
You don't push a button
and something pops out

55:46.176 --> 55:47.469
- the other end.
- Yes, I am well aware.

55:47.552 --> 55:49.012
Apparently, there's about
20 of them down there.

55:49.095 --> 55:51.014
Why don't we just ask them
if they can come back tomorrow?

55:51.097 --> 55:53.266
Logan, they are coming up.
And if you don't open the door,

55:53.349 --> 55:54.601
- they will kick it in.

55:54.684 --> 55:56.227
And if you don't open
the filing cabinet,

55:56.311 --> 55:59.397
they will pull out a crowbar.
This is a show of resolve.

55:59.481 --> 56:01.775
And there are cameras outside,
and they do not need

56:01.858 --> 56:04.110
to see the FBI
meeting any resistance.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.320
What do we say?

56:11.159 --> 56:14.621
-♪ ♪

56:17.290 --> 56:18.833
- Cooperate.
- Oh.

56:18.917 --> 56:20.585
Open up. Let them in.

56:20.668 --> 56:22.295
Okay, I will call down
and I'll ask to talk

56:22.378 --> 56:24.172
to the lead agent,
and we'll work something out.

56:24.255 --> 56:25.298
Okay.

56:25.381 --> 56:27.759
We're cooperating.
- We're cooperating.

56:27.842 --> 56:30.762
Get the special committee.
Shift the legals.

56:32.430 --> 56:33.598
We're cooperating.

56:34.974 --> 56:37.811
<i>People watch
our channel for so long,</i>

56:37.894 --> 56:39.687
<i>we had to animate our logo,</i>

56:39.771 --> 56:42.482
because it was burning
into people's screens.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.234
I mean, that is how loyal

56:44.317 --> 56:45.610
- the viewers are.

56:45.693 --> 56:48.029
And, you know, we will survive
this whole episode,

56:48.113 --> 56:50.406
because--
because of our strength,

56:50.490 --> 56:52.784
because of our depth of talent,

56:52.867 --> 56:58.123
and because of our values,
our true values. Yes?

56:58.206 --> 57:00.792
The FBI is raiding...

57:07.799 --> 57:09.884
Um... Guys,
just a little heads-up.

57:09.968 --> 57:11.261
And this is not something

57:11.344 --> 57:13.388
I want us to get
out of proportion
or spoil the evening,

57:13.471 --> 57:16.933
but it would seem
that some agents
of Federal Law Enforcement

57:17.016 --> 57:19.602
are raiding the premises
right now.

57:19.686 --> 57:22.480
So, if you see them,
uh, that's what that is.

57:26.860 --> 57:30.029
It's fine. It's fine.
Just fucking leave it.

57:33.032 --> 57:36.161
<i>As you can see,
the FBI is currently raiding</i>

57:36.244 --> 57:38.788
<i>the Waystar headquarters
in lower Manhattan</i>

57:38.872 --> 57:39.998

57:40.081 --> 57:42.959

Cruise scandal.</i>
