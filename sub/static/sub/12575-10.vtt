00:33.732 --> 00:36.929
HANK: This grout is supposed
to stay white for 20 years.

00:37.503 --> 00:39.835
What's it been? 17, 18?

00:40.139 --> 00:42.903
HANK: Peggy, where's that receipt?
LUANNE: Uncle Hank!

00:43.976 --> 00:47.173
Don't you know not to barge in
here when I'm in the shower?

00:47.246 --> 00:50.044
For goodness sakes, Hank,
you are fully clothed.

00:50.115 --> 00:53.016
This time!
Next time, I might not be so lucky.

00:53.085 --> 00:55.110
Just look at Ladybird.

00:55.187 --> 00:58.520
HANK: Ladybird, didn't Luanne
make you look pretty?

00:58.590 --> 01:00.649
Pretty dog. Who's a pretty dog?

01:00.726 --> 01:04.287
<i>Get that stuff off of her.
She looks like Fran Drescher.</i>

01:04.363 --> 01:08.925
I didn't put it on.
Your dog ate all my cruelty-free makeups.

01:09.001 --> 01:12.164
Honey, calm down.
If she tries it again, you just give her...

01:12.237 --> 01:14.831
a little tap on the fanny
with a rolled-up newspaper.

01:14.907 --> 01:19.674
I spent extra money to buy cruelty-free!
I'll do a lot more than "tap" her!

01:22.181 --> 01:24.206
<i>JOSEPH: I found a spark plug.</i>

01:24.283 --> 01:27.116
BOBBY: Great! Now all we need
are five more of those...

01:27.186 --> 01:30.417
an engine, four wheels,
some kind of frame...

01:30.489 --> 01:33.583
and a cassette radio,
and we got our death cart!

01:33.659 --> 01:36.492
Hey, look what I found.

01:39.331 --> 01:41.561
A Manitoba 100.

01:41.767 --> 01:44.065
"The official cigarette of...

01:44.136 --> 01:47.435
"of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police."

01:47.840 --> 01:48.829
Wow!

01:49.241 --> 01:51.209
I never had one of those.

01:51.276 --> 01:53.608
You ever had any cigarette?

01:54.346 --> 01:56.439
Well, no. How about you?

01:56.782 --> 01:58.977
Only secondhand from my dad.

01:59.451 --> 02:01.282
You wanna spark it?

02:03.622 --> 02:05.590
<i>BOYS: Now! Now!</i>

02:16.068 --> 02:17.899
BOBBY: Quick! Pull the knob!

02:19.671 --> 02:23.038
Is someone in there? Is this john occupied?

02:27.246 --> 02:28.270
<i>BOBBY: Si.</i>

02:28.347 --> 02:30.076
Bobby? Is that you?

02:33.419 --> 02:34.943
<i>PEGGY: Do you want to lose a lung?</i>

02:43.595 --> 02:46.189
I thought those were the ingredients.

02:46.265 --> 02:49.723
PEGGY: Do not be a smart mouth,
young man! I gave up smoking...

02:49.802 --> 02:52.999
so you'd be free of birth defects,
and this is how you repay me?

02:53.072 --> 02:55.939
Yeah! You don't know
how hard it is to quit!

02:56.008 --> 02:58.568
Your mother and I
went through hell trying to...

02:58.644 --> 03:01.841
Hey, don't recline-o-mite
while I'm talking to you!

03:01.914 --> 03:04.940
PEGGY: Bobby, smoking is
a nasty, filthy habit!

03:05.017 --> 03:09.181
<i>Only trailer trash smoke nowadays!
Do you want to look like trailer trash?</i>

03:09.254 --> 03:11.620
That's not fair! I don't smoke!

03:12.391 --> 03:13.653
PEGGY: Luanne!

03:13.725 --> 03:15.590
Lord. Hank, you finish this.

03:15.661 --> 03:17.253
<i>Honey, you are not trash.</i>

03:17.329 --> 03:20.423
<i>Just 'cause you grew up in a trailer
and your mama's in prison...</i>

03:20.499 --> 03:24.094
All right, Joe Camel,
you wanna smoke, let's go smoke.

03:25.204 --> 03:29.573
HANK: Now look here,
you are gonna smoke this entire carton.

03:32.811 --> 03:35.712
I thought you said
you didn't want me to smoke anymore.

03:35.781 --> 03:38.409
HANK: Oh, this'll take care of that,
believe me.

03:38.484 --> 03:43.319
I wish my daddy had had the parenting
skills to do this for me, I tell you what.

03:44.756 --> 03:48.817
<i>Start puffing, boy.
We gotta get through 200 of these.</i>

03:49.261 --> 03:52.958
Joseph, I understand you smoked
your first cigarette today.

03:53.065 --> 03:55.863
I'm sorry, Dad. I'll never smoke again.

03:55.934 --> 03:57.731
Whoa! Hold on, son!

03:57.903 --> 04:01.862
I want you to keep an open mind,
so you can make an informed decision.

04:01.940 --> 04:05.603
If you want, you can read a bloated
government report on smoking...

04:05.677 --> 04:10.512
or go straight to the horse's mouth and
get the facts from the tobacco industry!

04:19.892 --> 04:23.225
For God sakes, Bobby,
what nationality are you?

04:23.295 --> 04:24.489
American.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.997
Then why are you holding your cigarette...

04:27.065 --> 04:30.091
like some kind of European Nazi
in a movie?

04:30.169 --> 04:31.602
Why does it matter?

04:31.670 --> 04:34.935
That's not the right sort of attitude
for you to have.

04:35.007 --> 04:39.205
Whatever you do, you should do right,
even if it's something wrong.

04:39.545 --> 04:40.637
Okay.

04:42.181 --> 04:45.480
HANK: No, I said American.
Here, let me show you.

04:59.665 --> 05:03.123
That is not how to inhale, Bobby.
You're hot-boxing it.

05:03.402 --> 05:05.370
You gotta inhale slow.

05:13.145 --> 05:14.373
You see?

05:14.713 --> 05:17.079
<i>Slow like that.</i>

05:17.382 --> 05:19.043
BOBBY:  Okay.

05:19.117 --> 05:22.052
Wait a minute.
Let me show you one more time.

05:22.721 --> 05:27.420
<i>Yep, no two ways about it.
Smoking is a filthy, disgusting habit.</i>

05:30.596 --> 05:32.325
How come you smoked?

05:32.397 --> 05:35.195
Well, it wasn't as bad for you back then.

05:36.902 --> 05:37.869
Wow!

05:37.936 --> 05:39.904
Pretty keen, huh?

05:39.972 --> 05:42.770
The trick is
to get your thumb under the filter.

05:42.841 --> 05:44.672
But, of course, smoking is wrong...

05:44.743 --> 05:48.144
so you'll have to try this
with a dowel or something.

05:53.719 --> 05:55.448
Come on. Only one pack left.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.385
I think I'm gonna barf.

05:57.456 --> 06:00.653
That's what I wanted to hear.
Good job, son.

06:07.366 --> 06:10.767
When you're finished,
you wanna get that with a hose?

06:11.737 --> 06:15.332
You see, raising a boy
is like fixing a radiator.

06:15.407 --> 06:17.739
You don't talk it into working right...

06:17.809 --> 06:20.903
you have to take it out back
and flush it clean.

06:36.995 --> 06:38.189
What's wrong, Hank?

06:38.263 --> 06:39.890
Why do you always ask me that?

06:39.965 --> 06:42.798
What's wrong with you?
How does that sound, for a change?

06:42.868 --> 06:44.961
Well, I just asked you once.

06:45.037 --> 06:47.437
Is it about Bobby and that cigarette today?

06:47.506 --> 06:49.235
No, I took care of that.

06:49.308 --> 06:54.041
I made him smoke a whole carton until
he was as sick as he's ever been in his life.

06:54.112 --> 06:57.411
Hank Hill!
What on God's earth were you thinking?

06:57.482 --> 06:59.006
He's just a little boy.

06:59.084 --> 07:01.450
You stunt his growth,
he will stay that way!

07:01.520 --> 07:05.513
Peggy, it's late. I'm tired.
Let's just go to sleep.

07:06.525 --> 07:07.617
Okay.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.529
HANK: I gotta go do some stuff.

07:11.596 --> 07:14.394
I think I might have left the blender on.

08:20.799 --> 08:22.562
Hey there, Enrique.

08:24.002 --> 08:26.903
<i>Sorry, Mr. Hill.
I know I'm not supposed to be smoking.</i>

08:26.972 --> 08:30.874
Hell, what's a rule for,
if you can't break it once in a while?

08:34.413 --> 08:37.678
<i>And times got hard
after NAFTA sent the pinata jobs north.</i>

08:37.749 --> 08:40.013
That's quite a story, Enrique.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.009
I like stories.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.647
<i>I like stories about pinatas.</i>

08:45.390 --> 08:47.915
In fact, I like everything you have to say.

08:47.993 --> 08:50.723
Let's me and you visit
your hometown sometime...

08:50.796 --> 08:53.424
the way you had
the courtesy to come see mine.

08:53.498 --> 08:55.762
I'd be honored for you to meet my family.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.462
And I'd be honored for you to meet my...

08:58.537 --> 09:00.164
Oh, no! My wife!

09:00.405 --> 09:03.306
Hi, Hank.
Honey, can you take a lunch break?

09:04.042 --> 09:05.134
<i>Sure.</i>

09:26.431 --> 09:28.228
How do you like that?

09:29.301 --> 09:31.292
Is your heart racing?

09:31.636 --> 09:33.103
<i>Are you upset?</i>

09:34.439 --> 09:37.408
Now you know how I feel
when you eat my make-ups!

09:37.476 --> 09:41.242
For heaven's sake! That flesh-eating virus
has claimed another victim.

09:41.313 --> 09:43.281
Don't let it worry you, Peggy.

09:43.348 --> 09:45.407
<i>Sometimes you just gotta relax...</i>

09:45.484 --> 09:48.578
and enjoy life for all its rich, mellow flavor.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.011
Hank! What are you doing?

09:53.525 --> 09:54.549
Well...

09:54.626 --> 09:57.117
Bobby vomited with one pack to go.

09:57.195 --> 09:59.789
I couldn't throw 'em out.
That would be wasteful.

09:59.865 --> 10:02.231
But we haven't smoked for 12 years.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.097
I know, but, well...

10:04.569 --> 10:07.163
Hey, doesn't the smell take you back?

10:30.262 --> 10:31.627
Hey, wait a minute.

10:34.966 --> 10:36.228
PEGGY: Hank.

10:43.508 --> 10:44.975
PEGGY: That's right.

10:45.577 --> 10:47.977
That feels like what? A hundred years ago.

10:48.046 --> 10:49.775
It doesn't have to.

11:03.094 --> 11:05.221
<i>Shouldn't we be getting home?</i>

11:05.297 --> 11:08.391
No, Hank. Let's just stay a moment longer.

11:11.236 --> 11:12.464
HANK: Oh, boy!

11:14.839 --> 11:17.273
I feel so alive with pleasure!

11:25.417 --> 11:27.180
Fine day, isn't it, boy?

11:27.252 --> 11:31.120
Hank, there is a tile in the bathroom...

11:31.189 --> 11:32.713
that I think we missed.

11:32.791 --> 11:36.090
Really? Well, I better check that out.

11:43.168 --> 11:46.899
Well, I found the "tile."
Thank you very much, Peggy.

11:47.072 --> 11:48.334
And I looked at it...

11:48.406 --> 11:51.842
but there's still some more "tile"
for you to look at.

11:51.910 --> 11:56.279
You know, I think I will save
the rest of my "tile" for after breakfast.

11:56.348 --> 11:59.112
Will you stop talking
about your stupid tile?

11:59.184 --> 12:03.211
If it's so dirty, go clean it!
And if it's clean, you can shut up!

12:05.790 --> 12:07.690
Hey, I've got an idea!

12:08.226 --> 12:11.855
Let's go eat at that place
we used to go when we smoked...

12:12.230 --> 12:13.993
with the jazz combo.

12:14.065 --> 12:16.260
<i>- Smokey's?
- Yeah, that's the one.</i>

12:25.877 --> 12:26.935
Yep.

12:27.912 --> 12:28.970
Yep.

12:30.315 --> 12:31.407
Yep.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.920
Mmm. Hmm.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.821
Hey, man, y'all put that dang old thing out!

12:43.928 --> 12:47.728
Y'all gonna light up like that, man,
it'll treat y'all like a dang old junkie!

12:47.799 --> 12:51.667
Go messing up my head with that dang
old secondary nicotine like that, man.

12:51.736 --> 12:54.330
Oh, Hank, I thought you gave that up.

12:54.639 --> 12:56.971
Welcome back, friend!

12:57.142 --> 12:59.303
I knew this day would come!

12:59.377 --> 13:01.140
Dale, get off of me.

13:04.683 --> 13:08.779
<i>Yep, same old Smokey's.
Place hasn't changed a bit.</i>

13:08.853 --> 13:11.754
<i>Where is old Smokey?
We would love to say hi.</i>

13:11.823 --> 13:14.121
<i>Smokey's no longer with us.</i>

13:14.192 --> 13:15.625
I am so sorry.

13:15.694 --> 13:17.389
It's for the best, darlin'.

13:17.462 --> 13:20.795
Those last few years
when it spread to his bones...

13:21.232 --> 13:23.132
<i>Smoking or non-smoking?</i>

13:23.835 --> 13:25.097
<i>Smoking.</i>

13:54.599 --> 13:56.032
What's going on in here?

13:56.101 --> 13:59.696
PEGGY: What're you doing with that
cigarette? You'll burn the house down!

13:59.771 --> 14:02.001
Hey, all right! You guys smoke, too?

14:02.073 --> 14:06.271
What we do is none of your business!
I told you not to smoke!

14:06.344 --> 14:10.303
Do I have to take you out back
with another carton of cigarettes?

14:10.382 --> 14:11.906
I think you do.

14:11.983 --> 14:14.679
I cannot believe that you're all smoking!

14:14.753 --> 14:18.553
Don't you know that
more people die of smoking than die...

14:18.957 --> 14:21.926
of war in Vietnam every day?

14:21.993 --> 14:25.690
I'm begging you, put out your cigarettes,
and keep them out!

14:26.097 --> 14:27.587
<i>She's right, Hank.</i>

14:27.665 --> 14:31.032
How can we expect Bobby to quit
when we won't?

14:31.603 --> 14:34.504
We're the adults.
We have to set an example.

14:35.073 --> 14:36.802
BOBBY: Hey, that's my rug.

14:37.075 --> 14:39.703
HANK: No one said it was
gonna be easy, son.

14:44.950 --> 14:48.579
LEADER: Future non-smokers,
take a look to your left.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.691
Now take a look to your right.
Who do you see?

14:52.925 --> 14:55.917
Don't be shy.
There are no wrong answers here.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.427
MAN: I see a caring human being?
LEADER: No.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.791
You see your buddies for a better life!

15:02.167 --> 15:05.864
I've got the strangest feeling
someone's gonna kick his ass.

15:05.938 --> 15:08.839
Come on, Hank.
Will you just give it a chance?

15:08.907 --> 15:11.603
BILL: Yes, buddy. Give it a chance.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.272
Bill, what are you doing here?

15:14.346 --> 15:17.941
Well, I know you think of me
as a pretty together guy...

15:18.017 --> 15:20.144
but sometimes I need a little help.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.814
Just six nights a week for 20 years.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.720
LEADER: Looks like someone
found a buddy!

15:25.791 --> 15:29.318
Hey, there. Tell us your name
and how long you've been smoking.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.529
I'd rather not.

15:31.597 --> 15:35.328
I understand.
It's not easy to admit we're weak.

15:35.401 --> 15:39.201
You're calling me weak?
Look at your little birdie arms!

15:39.271 --> 15:42.638
They're no thicker than a cigarette!
I could smoke them little arms!

15:42.708 --> 15:44.642
Come on, Dad. Open up.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.169
Is this your son?

15:47.246 --> 15:50.181
It's beautiful how you came out
to support your daddy.

15:50.249 --> 15:51.682
I'm a smoker, too.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.748
Oh, no! How long have you been
addicted to cigarettes?

15:55.821 --> 15:58.722
<i>Since my dad let me smoke a whole carton.</i>

16:01.260 --> 16:05.697
Wait a minute. I didn't "let" him,
I made him. It was a punishment.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.396
- Can I get a new buddy?
- What is wrong with him?

16:09.468 --> 16:12.767
You are sick, sir! You shouldn't be allowed
to have children!

16:12.838 --> 16:17.332
Now, hold on a minute here. I didn't
bring my family here to be yelled at.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.869
I don't think I like this club.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.914
You all whine too much,
and the coffee's bad.

16:23.115 --> 16:26.573
I tell you what you need to do,
you need to take a 13th step...

16:26.652 --> 16:28.415
down off your high horse!

16:28.487 --> 16:29.579
BILL: Yeah!

16:35.127 --> 16:38.824
Here's to three of the bravest individuals
in all of Arlen!

16:39.398 --> 16:41.958
To the Hills, and their tobacco-free future!

16:42.034 --> 16:44.264
My God! Are you still talking?

16:44.570 --> 16:48.802
Why's my potato got skin on it? I hate skin!

16:48.874 --> 16:52.435
I will not sit here
and have my work insulted!

16:52.511 --> 16:57.073
What? Do you think that potatoes
fly into the bowl and mash themselves?

16:57.149 --> 17:00.346
LUANNE: I know y'all don't mean
none of those harsh words.

17:00.652 --> 17:02.711
It's just the nicotine withdrawal.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.983
Why is she still talking?

17:11.930 --> 17:12.988
Oh, my God!

17:13.065 --> 17:14.123
LUANNE: Drop it.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.689
Drop. Drop it.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.837
Bobby, Hank, hold on. I got it.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.311
When's this thing supposed to kick in?
It's not working!

17:31.383 --> 17:32.816
It's broken!

17:34.219 --> 17:36.312
Bobby, the patch goes on your shoulder!

17:36.388 --> 17:38.151
Bobby!

17:42.094 --> 17:44.289
<i>HANK: Bobby, spit it out! Spit it out!</i>

17:44.363 --> 17:46.797
PEGGY: Hank, you hold him,
I'll go get a stick!

17:56.642 --> 17:59.042
I wasn't gonna smoke it, I swear.

17:59.144 --> 18:00.873
I know. You did it.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.343
Good boy. Here's your treat.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.650
Bobby! Aunt Peg! Come in here!

18:08.020 --> 18:12.047
Uncle Hank's clean. He's gonna be okay.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.854
<i>Oh, yeah? Good job. Well done. So proud.</i>

18:14.927 --> 18:18.385
Let's celebrate. I'll make an icebox cake.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.455
Bobby, why don't you...

18:20.599 --> 18:21.588
Hey...

18:22.067 --> 18:23.796
Where's Aunt Peggy?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.933
The cigarette's gone!

18:26.205 --> 18:27.968
BOBBY: Mom!

18:28.740 --> 18:29.934
I found her.

18:30.008 --> 18:33.034
PEGGY: Close the damn door!
Can't you see that I am knitting?

18:33.111 --> 18:35.739
BOBBY: Mom, hand over the cigarette!

18:35.881 --> 18:36.905
No!

18:36.982 --> 18:40.042
Mom, this is not your son.
This is your buddy.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.143
PEGGY: No!
BOBBY: Hand it over!

18:42.754 --> 18:45.245
Who's your buddy? Who's your buddy?

18:46.859 --> 18:48.486
LUANNE: Well done, Bobby.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.996
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Give me that. I'm your mother!

18:52.064 --> 18:53.793
All of you, just stop it!

18:53.866 --> 18:55.333
Give me that!

18:55.601 --> 18:59.128
You want the cigarette?
You want it so bad?

18:59.638 --> 19:02.072
Come and get it! Come on!

19:03.442 --> 19:06.434
HANK: Hey! Out of there!
What are you doing, Luanne?

19:06.512 --> 19:08.605
PEGGY: Unlock this door right now!

19:08.814 --> 19:12.375
I'm crating y'all in like an unruly dog!

19:12.851 --> 19:15.376
I am sick of dysfunctional families!

19:15.454 --> 19:18.912
I came from one,
and I'm not gonna let it happen to you!

19:18.991 --> 19:21.619
Function! Function, damn you!

19:23.428 --> 19:24.417
Okay.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.394
Women and children first.
I take the first puff.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.196
Bobby here gets the second.

19:32.070 --> 19:34.300
If there's anything left, you!

19:34.373 --> 19:38.332
Who are you trying to kid?
We all know there won't be anything left.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.868
Let's you and me split it, Peg.
It'll be romantic.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.842
You know, like the old days,
before he came along!

19:46.118 --> 19:50.851
Mama, it's your son.
Nine months inside, remember?

19:51.290 --> 19:53.383
Those were good times, too!

19:53.458 --> 19:54.482
I don't know.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.892
This is happening too fast.
I just don't know.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.452
I do. Come on, Bobby.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.522
You and me can take her.
You go high, I'll go low.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.266
Hey, back off!

20:03.335 --> 20:06.065
PEGGY: I will drop it! I will! I will drop this!

20:10.876 --> 20:11.900
No!

20:15.847 --> 20:18.611
Well, look at us. At each other's throats.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.982
And after all we've been through!

20:21.053 --> 20:23.521
This family has survived
fires and twisters...

20:23.589 --> 20:26.956
and every strain of flu
the Orient could throw at us!

20:27.059 --> 20:30.517
Well, we are not gonna be done in
by a lousy tobacco leaf!

20:30.596 --> 20:33.030
We are gonna make it! Together!

20:33.098 --> 20:36.261
Now, who's with me?
Hands in the center! Come on!

21:09.501 --> 21:10.763
Oh, Hank.

21:10.969 --> 21:11.936
I know.

21:12.004 --> 21:15.201
Isn't it the most beautiful day
you've ever seen?

21:15.974 --> 21:18.135
What a day to be alive!

21:21.947 --> 21:24.541
BOBBY: Hey, Dad! Over here!
HANK: Go deep, Bobby!

21:25.283 --> 21:27.114
LUANNE: Hey, Bobby! Over here!

21:27.786 --> 21:29.117
HANK: All right.

21:29.187 --> 21:30.552
PEGGY: Me! Me, now!

21:30.622 --> 21:32.249
HANK: Over here, Peggy!

21:32.324 --> 21:33.348
HANK: Okay.

21:41.299 --> 21:43.733
 Y'all listen up, man.
This is Boomhauer.

21:43.801 --> 21:46.736
This is your lungs on air.
This is your lungs on smoke.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.237
<i>See the difference, man?</i>

21:48.306 --> 21:51.742
It'll stunt your growth all over.
End up in a dang old hospital bed...

21:51.809 --> 21:55.472
like Morton Downey Jr.,
Robert Downey Jr., or even worse, man.

21:55.546 --> 21:57.912
Y'all talk about oral gratification.

21:57.982 --> 22:01.076
All that dang. It's gonna give you
a low sperm count, man.

22:01.152 --> 22:02.881
Give you ear hair, yo.

22:02.954 --> 22:04.854
It just ain't no good.
