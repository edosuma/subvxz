WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.467
- I thought it might be
the Chesapeake Ripper, but there

00:04.500 --> 00:07.037
were no surgical trophies taken.
I'm gonna need you to prepare

00:07.070 --> 00:09.368
yourself on this one.
- I'm prepared.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.072
- Yeah, prepare yourself some
more. It's soup in there.
- Jack gave you his word

00:12.110 --> 00:15.432
he would protect your headspace,
yet he leaves you to your
mental devices.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.040
- Are you trying to alienate me
from Jack Crawford?

00:18.080 --> 00:21.243
- It's difficult to lie still
and fear gomg to sleep when
it's there to think about.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.317
(siren)
- Do you have a history
of sleepwalking, Mr. Graham?

00:24.350 --> 00:26.818
- My wife and I need to talk.
May we use your waiting room?

00:26.860 --> 00:29.488
- Lung cancer.
- When were you gonna tell me?

00:29.530 --> 00:32.294
- Do I seem different?
- But you've always been
a little different.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.457
- It's getting harder and harder
to make myself look.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.525
- I'm not gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.164
- I don't know how much longer
I can be all that useful
to you, Jack.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.293
- Really? The last three we had,
you caught.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.399
- You can't arrest_ me
for writing an article.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.409
- You don't write another word
about Will Graham and
I won't have to.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.685
- This is your final opportunity
to comply.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.780
On your feet, Dr. Gideon,
or we will restrain you.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.136
(door buzzer)

01:12.170 --> 01:15.094
Alright, lace your fingers
behind your head!

01:25.250 --> 01:27.514
Get a gurney!

01:57.350 --> 02:00.319
(monitor beeping)

02:09.660 --> 02:12.299
(flatline tone)

02:26.380 --> 02:28.735
- Well, thanks
to Freddie Lounds,

02:28.780 --> 02:30.748
there's an unconfirmed story
floating out there

02:30.780 --> 02:32.748
that the Chesapeake Ripper's
already in custody.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.748
- Unconfirmed.
Am I confirming?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.884
Fact-checking
for Freddie Lounds...

02:36.920 --> 02:39.218
- You're fact-checking
for me.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.353
- I always feel a little nervous
going into these places.

02:41.390 --> 02:42.857
- Why's that?

02:42.890 --> 02:44.858
- Afraid they won't let me out.
- Don't worry.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.858
I won't leave you here.
- Yeah, not today.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.869
- Dr. Bloom just called me
about you,

02:49.900 --> 02:52.789
Mr. Graham--or should I call you
Dr. Graham?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.865
- I'm not a doctor.
- You're not FBI either.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.868
That's a temporary
identification.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.866
- Mr. Graham teaches
at the academy.

02:58.910 --> 03:02.209
- Ah, a teacher. Please,
gentlemen, take a seat.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.649
- Thank you.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.815
Dr. Chilton, we're going
to need to see

03:08.850 --> 03:11.944
the crime scene while it's
still relatively undisturbed.

03:11.990 --> 03:14.959
- I assure you, for something
so disturbing, it is quite
undisturbed.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.925
- Why was a nurse left alone
with a prisoner

03:17.960 --> 03:20.599
in a high-security
psychiatric hospital?

03:20.630 --> 03:22.860
- For the two years
since he was brought here,

03:22.900 --> 03:24.595
Gideon behaved perfectly

03:24.630 --> 03:25.995
and gave every appearance

03:26.030 --> 03:28.635
of cooperating with attempts
at therapy. As dictated

03:28.670 --> 03:33.369
by our present administrator,
security around him was
slightly... relaxed.

03:33.410 --> 03:35.878
I cannot help
feeling responsible

03:35.910 --> 03:39.573
myself for what happened.
He sat directly across from me

03:39.620 --> 03:41.713
and I had no idea
what he was hiding.

03:41.750 --> 03:44.947
And now one
of our staff is dead.
- I understand, Doctor.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.356
Mr. Graham's going to need
to see the crime scene

03:47.390 --> 03:49.483
with as much privacy
as you can provide.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.589
- Oh, yes, that thing you do.

03:51.630 --> 03:55.953
You're quite the topic
of conversation in, uh,
psychiatric circles, Mr. Graham.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.560
-Am I?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.034
- Uh, yes.
A unique cocktail

04:01.070 --> 04:05.632
of personality disorders
and neuroses that make you
a highly skilled profiler.

04:05.670 --> 04:08.707
- He's not here to be analyzed.
- Perhaps he should be.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.049
We are woefully short
of material

04:11.080 --> 04:13.469
on your sort of thing,
Mr. Graham.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.476
Would you mind speaking
to some of the staff?

04:15.520 --> 04:18.489
- Doctor.
- No, no, no. Not this trip.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.886
Maybe a special visit.
- Thank you, Dr. Chilton.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.582
I'd like to see
the crime scene now.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.621
- So, Gideon was restrained?

04:25.660 --> 04:27.628
- Handcuffed.
- Hm.

04:27.660 --> 04:29.764
- He concealed a fork tine
in the palm of his hand

04:29.800 --> 04:32.360
and used it to pick the lock.
- Where is he now?

04:32.400 --> 04:35.437
- In his cell.
You'll note

04:35.470 --> 04:37.859
the removal of organs
and the abdominal mutilations

04:37.910 --> 04:40.037
are all consistent
with the Chesapeake Ripper.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.469
- So is the brutalization
of the corpses, but that doesn't

04:42.510 --> 04:44.671
change the fact that
the Ripper is still out there.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.974
- Jack, what I'm about
to show you

04:47.020 --> 04:49.318
suggests othenNise.
(door buzzer)

04:51.620 --> 04:55.659
- Dr. Chilton consulted
on the case when we failed

04:55.690 --> 04:58.557
to catch the Ripper after
his last series of murders.

05:13.410 --> 05:15.071
- The reason you failed

05:15.110 --> 05:17.840
and kept failing to capture
the Chesapeake Ripper...

05:17.880 --> 05:20.542
was I already had him.

06:21.980 --> 06:25.507
(monitor beeping)

06:41.230 --> 06:43.824
(flatline tone)

07:03.690 --> 07:05.544
(nurse crying out)

08:12.660 --> 08:14.651
- Um...

08:17.830 --> 08:18.979
As far as we know,

08:19.030 --> 08:21.624
it's been over two years since
the Chesapeake Ripper killed?

08:21.660 --> 08:24.663
- That's correct.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.991
- When was Gideon admitted?

08:29.040 --> 08:31.031
- Almost two years ago.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.171
Lass, Miriam Regina.
Come in.

08:39.210 --> 08:41.872
- Morning, Agent Crawford.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.616
- Sorry to pull you out
of class. There's nothing wrong.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.754
Uh, no reason
to be nervous.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.054
- I'm not_ nervous.
Curious.

08:49.090 --> 08:50.887
- Your instructors tell me

08:50.930 --> 08:53.899
that you are in the top 10%?
- Top five, sir.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.899
- You're gonna have
to stop correcting me
if we're gonna get along, Lass.

08:56.930 --> 08:58.795
Take a seat.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.798
You wrote me

09:00.840 --> 09:03.308
a letter when you qualified
for the academy.

09:03.340 --> 09:06.730
- I wasn't sure you got it.
You never replied.

09:06.780 --> 09:10.045
- Never do. Odds are against any
trainee completing the program.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.675
But I'm glad to see
you're still here.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.177
In your letter, you said
you wanted to work for me

09:16.220 --> 09:18.188
in the Violent Criminal
Apprehen5ion Program.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.017
- Yes, sir.
- There might be an opportunity.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.119
I'm assuming
that you're familiar

09:22.160 --> 09:24.355
with the Chesapeake Ripper.
- Yes.

09:24.390 --> 09:28.121
- The Ripper's very hot
right now. Killed his last two
victims in six days. There'll be

09:28.160 --> 09:30.219
at least one more body
and then nothing for months.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.966
- They say
he's a true sociopath.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.695
- What do you say?

09:34.740 --> 09:37.937
- I say they don't know
what else to label him.

09:37.970 --> 09:39.938
He has some
of the characteristics

09:39.980 --> 09:43.939
of what they call a sociopath--
no remorse or guilt at all.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.948
He won't have any
of the other marks.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.345
He won't be a drifter.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.780
He'll have no history
of trouble with the law.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.788
He'll be hard to catch.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.618
- I'm assigning you to the
Chesapeake Ripper task force.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.651
You're gonna work
directly under me.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.821
- I'm grateful for
the opportunity, Agent Crawford.

10:00.860 --> 10:04.091
But I can't help
wondering... why me?

10:04.130 --> 10:06.837
- You have _
a foren5ics fellowship,

10:06.870 --> 10:08.838
six years of law enforcement,

10:08.870 --> 10:12.772
a degree in psychology,
doctorate in criminology.

10:12.810 --> 10:16.974
And what I don't have are
enough warm bodies.

10:17.010 --> 10:20.309
So, I'm gonna need
your full attention on this.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.944
- (Miriam): Yes, sir.

10:24.950 --> 10:27.953
- Th_e_volume of Abel Gideon's
mail is becoming a nUIsance.

10:27.990 --> 10:31.949
Sometimes I feel
like his secretary
rather than his keeper.

10:31.990 --> 10:35.391
- Any specific correspondences
that stood out from the others?

10:35.430 --> 10:38.263
- Mostly researchers
or PhD candidates

10:38.300 --> 10:41.736
requesting interviews.
A scattered dozen lonely hearts

10:41.770 --> 10:45.035
seeking his hand in marriage.
- He butchered

10:45.070 --> 10:48.107
his last wife and her family
on Thanksgiving.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.143
- There's no accounting
for taste--or intelligence.

10:51.180 --> 10:55.139
- Murdering his wife was
impulsive. The Chesapeake Ripper

10:55.180 --> 10:57.944
is methodical, meticulous.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.981
That's why he's so hard
to catch.

11:00.020 --> 11:02.409
- Was so hard to catch.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.857
Will you be conducting
a joint interview?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.425
- Separate.
Compare and contrast.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.325
- I know you're anxious
to get on with it.

11:11.370 --> 11:14.237
You have talked to Gideon
before, for some length of time.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.909
- Well, I saw him mainly
in court. I wrote an article

11:16.940 --> 11:19.204
about him in the Journal
of Criminal Psychology.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.936
- He is very familiar
with you.

11:21.980 --> 11:24.403
He has given you
a lot of thought.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.010
- You had some sessions
with him?

11:27.050 --> 11:30.781
- Yes, two, a couple years
ago when he was first
institutionalized.

11:30.820 --> 11:34.312
- I've read your notes,
of course. They were
more or less helpful

11:34.360 --> 11:37.989
as I conducted my own interviews
with Dr. Gideon over the years.

11:38.030 --> 11:42.148
- Well, I'm glad I was helpful.
- (Will): More or less.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.288
- I'll go first.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.332
(door buzzer)

12:10.290 --> 12:13.748
- Why, Dr. Bloom.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.756
How wonderful to see you again.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.462
- You remembered.
- I've met a lot

12:18.500 --> 12:20.968
of psychiatrists in the last
two years. It's hard to forget

12:21.000 --> 12:23.059
one so sublime.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.908
- Thank you for your time,
Dr. Gideon. I won't waste it.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.908
Shall we begin?

12:27.940 --> 12:30.170
- Dr. Bloom,
what is this to be?

12:30.210 --> 12:32.974
I was caught red-handed.
I mean, literally.

12:33.020 --> 12:36.979
There's no mystery
as to whodunit. I did it.

12:37.020 --> 12:41.081
- The mystery is whether you are
who you say you are.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.486
Or not.
- Never liked being called

12:43.530 --> 12:45.555
the Chesapeake Ripper.

12:45.590 --> 12:49.253
Maybe something
with a little more wit.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.963
- Is that why you didn't take
credit for the Ripper murders
before now?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.959
- Just watching the goose chase
from the box seats.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.228
- Two years of goose chasing.

12:59.270 --> 13:02.330
You must be a very patient man.
- Are you just gonna run

13:02.380 --> 13:05.508
the psychopathic checklist here?
I have had my personality

13:05.550 --> 13:08.542
inventoried by the Minnesota
Multiphasic.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.980
- Would you prefer
a Rorschach test?

13:11.020 --> 13:13.113
- Well, if you're gonna
show me those pictures,

13:13.160 --> 13:16.982
maybe you should put a blood
pressure cuff to my genitals.

13:17.030 --> 13:21.057
I find it gives
a much truer gauge of reaction.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.866
- What effect were you hoping
to have by killing

13:24.900 --> 13:26.527
the night nurse?

13:26.570 --> 13:32.133
- The effect I was hoping
to have was her death.

13:32.170 --> 13:34.331
Mission accomplished.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.838
- Brutalization of the body was
done posthumously.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.939
- Chesapeake Ripper usually

13:39.980 --> 13:41.948
does that sort of thing during,

13:41.980 --> 13:43.948
not after.

13:43.990 --> 13:50.054
- I do not have to convince you
that I am the Chesapeake Ripper.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.820
- Seems that's what you need
to do.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.269
- Certainly what somebody needs.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.575
- Jack.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.417
Come in.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.552
- I'm sorry. Um...

14:27.560 --> 14:29.653
I was just, uh...

14:29.700 --> 14:31.668
- In the neighborhood.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.032
- Yeah, something
like that.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.278
- How's Mrs. Crawford?

14:40.310 --> 14:42.528
- Yeah, that's why I was
in the neighborhood.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.245
She's fine.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.373
Well, she tells me
that she's fine

14:48.420 --> 14:51.981
and she tells me
when she's not.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.318
- You expect me
to tell you more?

14:54.360 --> 14:57.523
- Look, Bella's
at a NATO conference.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.495
I can't talk to her.
She's working.

15:00.530 --> 15:04.068
I doubt I could talk
to her if she was here.
- About her condition?

15:04.100 --> 15:06.068
- Yeah. About her cancer,
about her dying.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.091
She doesn't want to talk
to me about it.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.204
- I am prohibited from talking
about it--doctor-patient
confidentiality.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.277
- You talk to me
about Will Graham.

15:16.310 --> 15:20.019
- Will Graham is_ not
offICIally my patient.
We have conversations.

15:20.050 --> 15:23.144
- What do you
consider this?

15:23.190 --> 15:24.782
- Desperate coping.

15:29.060 --> 15:32.689
- You don't think I have a right
to know what's happening
with my wife?

15:32.730 --> 15:36.427
- You have every right to know
what's happening,
but not from me.

15:36.460 --> 15:40.692
- Well, I'm not just gonna
stand outside my marriage
and watch this happen.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.662
If that's what she wants,
too bad.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.258
She married the wrong guy
for that.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.976
- I'll offer one insight.

15:48.010 --> 15:50.046
She doesn't think
she married the wrong guy.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.113
- I can't stop thinking about
when my wife is gonna die.

15:58.150 --> 16:01.051
I look at her side of the bed
and I think,

16:01.090 --> 16:03.081
"Is she gonna die there?"

16:05.090 --> 16:08.093
I can't stop thinking about it,
you understand? I can't stop.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.525
- You're dreading the loss
of your wife.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.132
- Yes.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.601
And I'm thinking
about other losses too.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.187
- What other losses are
you dreading?

16:33.720 --> 16:36.280
Jack, you can't save her.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.288
She won't let you.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.321
The cancer won't let you.

16:43.530 --> 16:45.794
Who else couldn't
you save?

16:45.830 --> 16:48.594
- (Miriam): Where is everyone?

16:48.640 --> 16:51.029
- It's just you and me
for the time being.

16:51.070 --> 16:54.278
Take a look around here.
Tell me what you see.

17:11.260 --> 17:14.388
- He did it all here.

17:14.430 --> 17:17.365
Did it while he was alive.
He struck the throat

17:17.400 --> 17:19.368
so he couldn't call for help.
- Do you think

17:19.400 --> 17:22.267
he was unconscious
when the Ripper did the ripping?

17:22.300 --> 17:24.302
- No, he'd want him awake.

17:26.570 --> 17:29.130
Organs were removed.

17:29.180 --> 17:32.479
Not all of them. He was choosy.
He took the liver, thymus,

17:32.510 --> 17:34.512
but left the heart.

17:37.320 --> 17:40.153
- What's he doing
with the organs?

17:40.190 --> 17:42.488
- Surgical trophies.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.751
He's a medical doctor, isn't he?
Is that why you call him
the Ripper?

17:45.790 --> 17:48.554
- Why do you say that?

17:50.570 --> 17:53.198
- Psychopaths are attracted
to surgical fields.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.562
They offer power.
They require the ability

17:56.600 --> 17:59.569
to make objective clinical
decisions without feeling.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.578
- White male?

18:01.610 --> 18:04.170
Forties? Fifties?

18:04.210 --> 18:07.441
- I don't know
that he's white.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.744
He's exotic somehow,

18:09.780 --> 18:12.340
which is why
you're gonna catch him.

18:12.390 --> 18:15.450
- I'm gonna catch him?

18:15.490 --> 18:18.584
- We call you the guru.

18:18.630 --> 18:21.224
You have a peculiar
cleverness.

18:21.260 --> 18:24.525
- I'll take _that
as a compliment.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.663
- You should.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.828
You'll probably spot him
before anybody else.

18:29.870 --> 18:32.304
- Or you will.

18:36.310 --> 18:39.700
Now I want you
to take a look at this.

18:43.420 --> 18:46.639
- There's no
detectable consistency
with the Ripper victims.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.908
He doesn't hunt exclusively
within his own ethnic group.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.520
He's killed all creeds,
colors, men and women.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.927
- She has the exact same
wound pattern as the last-known
victim of the Chesapeake Ripper.

18:54.960 --> 18:59.522
I mean exact.
- We never found a body
for his last-known victim.

18:59.570 --> 19:03.199
- Then the victim before that.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.300
- I see the Ripper,
but I don't...

19:06.340 --> 19:08.308
feel the Ripper.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.672
This is plagiarism.
- We never made

19:10.710 --> 19:13.941
the wound patterns for any
of the Ripper's victims public.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.517
- Well, maybe he is the Ripper.
I don't know.

19:16.550 --> 19:19.542
But if he's a plagiarist,
the real Chesapeake Ripper is

19:19.590 --> 19:22.684
gonna make sure
everybody knows it.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.928
(Jack sighs.)

19:25.960 --> 19:28.451
(phone ringing)

19:41.480 --> 19:43.448
- Hello.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.846
- [Jack. Jack.]

19:45.880 --> 19:47.438
- Who is this?

19:47.480 --> 19:49.710
- [Jack, it's Miriam.]

19:49.750 --> 19:53.789
[I don't know where I am.
I can't see anything.]
- Miriam?

19:53.820 --> 19:56.709
- [I was so wrong.
I was so wrong.]

19:56.760 --> 20:00.628
- Miriam?
- [Please... Jack. Please.]

20:00.660 --> 20:02.651
(Signal cuts out.)

20:10.270 --> 20:13.239
- I'm hooked in
to every carrier database

20:13.280 --> 20:15.601
and telephone provider
in the United States.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.801
Nothing.
- Look again.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.478
- I did my agains.
And my again and again

20:20.520 --> 20:22.670
and agains. I can't find
any electronic trace

20:22.720 --> 20:25.609
of any call made to your home
at 2:46am.

20:25.650 --> 20:27.789
- I am telling you
that the phone rang.

20:27.820 --> 20:30.823
- Wake your wife up?
- I was alone.

20:30.860 --> 20:33.897
- Whoever made that call could
have made it from that little
box outside your house

20:33.930 --> 20:36.296
or a junction
in your neighborhood.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.389
Either way, there would be
no trace signal

20:38.430 --> 20:41.399
to track.
_ - You_'r_e sure
it was Miriam Lass?

20:41.440 --> 20:44.329
- It was Miriam.
- You haven't heard
her voice in two years, Jack.

20:44.370 --> 20:46.930
- You gonna continue
to question me on this, 2?

20:46.970 --> 20:50.849
If so, maybe I should ask you
to leave the room while it's
still safe for you to be here.

20:52.850 --> 20:57.878
The Chesapeake Ripper recorded
Miriam Lass two years ago
as he was killing her.

20:57.920 --> 21:03.620
Last night, he called my house
at 2:46am. He played
that recording for me.

21:03.660 --> 21:06.652
- Well, then we know
the Chesapeake Ripper is
not Dr. Gideon, because

21:06.690 --> 21:08.794
we know the call wasn't made
from the Baltimore

21:08.830 --> 21:12.061
State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane.
- That we would've been able

21:12.100 --> 21:16.469
to trace. _
- Are you certain
it was a recording?

21:16.500 --> 21:22.507
Jack, you said
yourself there's no body.
- Miriam Lass is dead!

21:22.540 --> 21:27.318
The Chesapeake Ripper is making
it very clear that someone is
plagiarizing his work!

21:27.350 --> 21:29.910
- It was 2:46 in the morning,
Jack. You're in a deep sleep,
you're roused, you're

21:29.950 --> 21:32.919
disoriented. You might not even
know you're still asleep.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.480
- I know when I'm awake.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.928
(Sigh)

22:01.650 --> 22:03.709
(stag bellowing)

22:06.550 --> 22:10.657
- Will? You look
like you were dreaming.

22:10.690 --> 22:12.885
- I was, uh, thinking
about something else.

22:12.930 --> 22:15.956
- Well, here's something
for you to think about.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.026
We have a direct way
of communicating

22:19.070 --> 22:22.437
with the Chesapeake Ripper,
and we'd like to see
if we can push him.

22:22.470 --> 22:26.759
- Push him toward what?
- We might be able
to influence him

22:26.810 --> 22:29.506
to become visible._
- If we can enrage him.

22:29.540 --> 22:32.509
- To what purpose, Jack?
H don't see_what
you're asking.

22:32.550 --> 22:36.441
- Do you think there's a way
to push the Chesapeake Ripper
and focus his attention?

22:36.480 --> 22:40.655
- Well, he's already focused
on Gideon as his adversary.
Don't fool around.

22:40.690 --> 22:43.989
- Gideon is just a tabloid rumor
right now. We think we need
to make him the truth.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.397
- You might push the Ripper
to kill again just to prove

22:47.430 --> 22:49.625
he isn't in a hospital
for the criminally insane.

22:52.030 --> 22:55.158
- Are you thinking about getting
into bed with Freddie Lounds?

22:55.200 --> 22:59.000
- You yourself know
it's the best way to bait
the real Chesapeake Ripper.

23:01.810 --> 23:04.677
- Morning, Agent Crawford.
Thank you for inviting me.

23:04.710 --> 23:07.417
- Miss Lounds.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.668
This is Dr. Alana Bloom.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.018
She's one of our psychiatric
consultants.

23:12.050 --> 23:14.018
I believe you know Will Graham.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.381
- Mr. Graham.
So good to see you.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.825
- Miss Lounds.

23:23.870 --> 23:27.192
You have all the qualities
of a good reporter. You have

23:27.230 --> 23:30.939
intelligence, guts,
a good eye.

23:30.970 --> 23:33.700
So how is it that you wind up
where you've ended up?

23:33.740 --> 23:36.777
- Where I wound up being
criminal justice journalism?

23:36.810 --> 23:40.769
- "Criminal justice journalism"
being a euphemism for
tabloid reporting.

23:40.820 --> 23:47.510
- You ran an unconfirmed story
about the Chesapeake Ripper.

23:47.560 --> 23:51.121
What I want is
for you to confirm it.

23:53.930 --> 23:56.490
- An exclusive story would be
a coup.

23:56.530 --> 23:59.863
- Mm, yes, it would.
And you would get

23:59.900 --> 24:02.789
the satisfaction of seeing
the Los Angeles Times,

24:02.840 --> 24:04.899
the sanctified
Washington Post,

24:04.940 --> 24:08.933
nd even the holy New York Times
un copyrighted material

24:08.980 --> 24:11.175
under your byline,

24:11.210 --> 24:15.249
with a picture credit.
- What's against you,

24:15.280 --> 24:17.248
and by association us,

24:17.280 --> 24:20.556
is that your brand
of journalism is obnoxious

24:20.590 --> 24:22.558
and therefore disliked.

24:22.590 --> 24:25.058
- Yes. That is an obstacle.

24:25.090 --> 24:28.628
Tried to get an interview
with Dr. Gideon.

24:28.660 --> 24:32.494
I was denied. Evidently some
trouble with my euphemism.

24:32.530 --> 24:36.068
- I'm friendly
with the new chief of staff.
I can get you an interVIew.

24:38.070 --> 24:41.198
- Not to snap bubble gum and
crack wise, but what's my angle?

24:41.240 --> 24:43.549
Is he the Chesapeake Ripper,

24:43.580 --> 24:45.639
or do you just want me
to tell everybody that he is?

24:45.680 --> 24:50.811
- He could be, and certain
personalities are attracted
to certain professions.

24:50.850 --> 24:52.818
- Do you know what profession

24:52.850 --> 24:55.512
psychopaths disproportionately
gravitate to?

24:55.560 --> 24:58.085
- CEOs, lawyers, the clergy.

24:58.130 --> 25:01.099
- Number five on the list is
surgeons.

25:01.130 --> 25:04.964
- I know the list.
- Well, then you know
what number six is.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.218
- Journalists.

25:07.270 --> 25:10.489
Know what number seven is,
Mr. Graham?

25:13.010 --> 25:16.138
- Law enforcement.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.273
- Here we are,

25:18.310 --> 25:21.518
a bunch of psychopaths
helping each other out.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.111
(door buzzer)

25:32.760 --> 25:35.752
(beeping)
(door buzzer)

25:51.080 --> 25:54.140
Dr. Gideon.
I'm Freddie Lounds.

25:54.180 --> 25:57.343
May I call you Dr. Gideon?

25:57.380 --> 25:59.985
Or do you prefer
the Chesapeake Ripper?

26:00.020 --> 26:03.626
His name is Dr. Abel Gideon,

26:03.660 --> 26:06.049
and strong evidence has surfaced
that he's far more

26:06.090 --> 26:09.059
than a mild-mannered surgeon
who cruelly murdered his wife.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.068
Maybe, just maybe,

26:11.100 --> 26:14.228
Gideon is the most sought-after
serial killer at large,

26:14.270 --> 26:16.591
a killer who's eluded the FBI
for years

26:16.640 --> 26:19.609
and has baffled
their most gifted profilers.

26:19.640 --> 26:23.701
That serial killer? None other
than the Chesapeake Ripper.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.799
This would explain why
the Ripper has been silent

26:26.850 --> 26:28.841
for more than two years.

26:37.420 --> 26:40.025
- (Gideon): So, are you enjoying
reading my mail?

26:40.060 --> 26:42.995
- No, not particularly.

26:43.030 --> 26:45.191
- Looking for something
instructional?

26:45.230 --> 26:48.688
Diagrams? Don't believe
I can recreate

26:48.740 --> 26:51.231
one of my own murders
from memory?

26:51.270 --> 26:53.830
- You wouldn't be recreating
them from your memory, Doctor.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.701
You're not
the Chesapeake Ripper.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.243
- Ooh, have to agree
to disagree.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.272
- Then why
the surgical trophies?

27:02.320 --> 27:05.642
- Agent Crawford, there are just
some things you're not allowed

27:05.690 --> 27:08.818
to do in a state-certified
operating room.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.919
- You didn't take any trophies
when you murdered your wife

27:10.960 --> 27:14.953
and her family on Thanksgiving.
You didn't put any of them
on display. Why not?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.422
- Crime of passion.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.896
You know how stressful
the holidays can get.

27:19.930 --> 27:24.139
Anyway, you didn't come here
to talk about my wife--

27:24.170 --> 27:25.865
or the little nursey.

27:25.910 --> 27:29.038
- Oh. What am I here
to talk about?

27:29.080 --> 27:32.004
- Your trainee.

27:32.050 --> 27:37.078
Miriam... somebody.

27:39.750 --> 27:42.184
- You're telling me
you killed Miriam Lass.

27:44.190 --> 27:47.250
- Yes. Didn't mean
to kill her.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.997
Don't get mad at me.

27:50.030 --> 27:51.998
- I'm not mad at you.

27:52.030 --> 27:54.260
I know where you are.
I know how you got here.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.768
I read your file.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.769
I'm curious, why are you being
so forthcoming all of a sudden?

27:59.810 --> 28:02.176
- Well, what have I got
to lose?

28:02.210 --> 28:05.839
You know where I am
and you know how I got here.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.918
- Why didn't you put her
on display?

28:10.950 --> 28:13.111
- What makes you think
I didn't?

28:13.150 --> 28:15.789
(cell phone ringing)

28:18.830 --> 28:20.923
- Excuse me.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.396
- The polite thing to do is
to ask them to call back.

28:24.430 --> 28:27.024
(door buzzer)

28:27.070 --> 28:29.766
Unless it's not an option.

28:31.770 --> 28:33.772
- You're home early.

28:36.310 --> 28:38.005
Bella? Something wrong?

28:38.050 --> 28:41.417
- [Jack, it's Miriam.
I don't know where I am.]

28:41.450 --> 28:43.884
[I can't see anything.]

28:43.920 --> 28:47.754
[I was so wrong.
I was so wrong.]

28:47.790 --> 28:50.782
[Please... Jack. Please.]

28:50.830 --> 28:52.821
(Signal cuts out.)

28:59.930 --> 29:01.898
- In my house.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.999
In my bedroom.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.008
Where my wife sleeps.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.076
- I've dusted the phone.

29:08.110 --> 29:09.930
Got a lot of usable prints.

29:09.980 --> 29:14.041
Nice detail too. I got
three distinct beauties here.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.968
Yours, your wife's,

29:16.020 --> 29:18.147
and presumably
the Chesapeake Ripper.

29:18.190 --> 29:21.250
- I can't imagine the Chesapeake
Ripper would start
leaving prints

29:21.290 --> 29:23.212
at his crime scenes now.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.979
- The Ripper put his head
on your wife's pillow.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.521
- Now somebody's sleeping
in my bed.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.893
- There he is.
Or there she is.

29:31.930 --> 29:35.434
Was Miriam Lass a blonde?
- Yes.

29:35.470 --> 29:38.109
- I pulled her fingerprints
from the VICAP database, Jack,

29:38.140 --> 29:39.539
and I got a match.

29:39.570 --> 29:42.232
- She's dead.
She wasn't here.

29:42.280 --> 29:46.808
- Jack. Did Miriam Lass know
where you live?

29:46.850 --> 29:50.240
- If she wanted to know, she was
smart enough to find out.
- She could've told

29:50.280 --> 29:53.044
the Chesapeake Ripper
before he killed her.

29:53.090 --> 29:56.355
Did you know you were
sending her after him?

29:56.390 --> 29:59.223
- I sent her
after information.

29:59.260 --> 30:02.491
- Whoever made that_ call thinks
you were close to Miriam Lass

30:02.530 --> 30:06.125
and feel responsible
for her death.

30:06.170 --> 30:09.367
- Don't you have classes today?

30:09.400 --> 30:11.129
Aren't you still in school?

30:11.170 --> 30:14.230
- Yes, sir. I thought this might
be more important

30:14.280 --> 30:16.931
than "Exclusionary Rules
of Search and Seizure".

30:16.980 --> 30:19.244
- Is that
what you thought?

30:19.280 --> 30:22.249
- I left a report here for you
last night.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.316
I don't know if you got it.
- I got it.

30:24.350 --> 30:28.150
- Did you read it?
- Go back to class.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.451
You feeling
frustrated, Lass?

30:33.490 --> 30:36.095
If so, you should start
forming calluses,

30:36.130 --> 30:39.395
some thick ones,
'cause frustration's
gonna wear you thin.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.903
- You could have
at least read the report.

30:43.940 --> 30:48.274
- I read it. _
- Your assessment? Sir.

30:48.310 --> 30:51.143
- My assessment is that
instead of being here

30:51.180 --> 30:55.571
you should be in a lecture hall
boning up on "Good Faith
Warrant Exceptions".

31:02.090 --> 31:04.456
What you're proposing
in your report breaks

31:04.490 --> 31:06.924
confidentiality laws.
You know that.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.019
You shouldn't be so dismissive

31:09.060 --> 31:10.994
of what you're learning here.

31:11.030 --> 31:13.328
- If the Chesapeake Ripper is
a surgeon,

31:13.370 --> 31:16.066
we should check medical records
for all of the known victims.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.308
I knew we couldn't get a warrant
if we didn't have something
substantial.

31:19.340 --> 31:22.036
- It's one thing for a trainee
to go poking around

31:22.080 --> 31:24.446
in private medical records
without a warrant;

31:24.480 --> 31:27.938
very different
if the guru did it.

31:30.220 --> 31:34.316
- Better_for a trainee to ask
for forgiveness than an FBI
agent to ask for permission?

31:34.360 --> 31:37.249
- In my experience.
- Then I hope you forgive me

31:37.290 --> 31:39.224
for skipping class today.

31:39.260 --> 31:43.651
- If someone were using
manipulative methods

31:43.700 --> 31:47.363
to subvert your sense
of control, you may
not realize it

31:47.400 --> 31:49.368
until _those methods are
p0inted out to you.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.267
- Which may be
a manipulative method in itself.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.271
- You were
a model patient.

31:56.310 --> 31:58.574
You behaved yourself
for two years.

31:58.610 --> 32:02.569
- Well, no opportunity
to be naughty.

32:02.620 --> 32:06.442
- You could have
been pushed.

32:06.490 --> 32:09.379
- Well, that would be unethical.

32:11.490 --> 32:15.153
- We can help you find out.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.225
But I need your trust
to do that.

32:17.260 --> 32:20.093
- Oh, I trust you, Dr. Bloom.

32:26.510 --> 32:29.308
- To the Chesapeake Ripper.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.308
Dr. Gideon is going

32:31.350 --> 32:34.444
to provide us with a singular
opportunity to analyze

32:34.480 --> 32:36.448
a pure sociopath.

32:36.480 --> 32:40.246
_ It is so rare _ _
to find one in captIVIty.

32:40.290 --> 32:43.612
(classical music playing)

32:43.660 --> 32:46.720
Ah. Dinner is served.

32:49.430 --> 32:53.719
- Inspired by Auguste Escoffier,
we are having long tangyuan

32:53.770 --> 32:55.465
en papillotte,

32:55.500 --> 32:58.606
served with a sauce of duxelles
and oyster mushrooms.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.232
Picked myself.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.205
- I don't think
I've ever had tongue before.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.276
- It was a particularly
chatty lamb.

33:05.310 --> 33:09.371
(Dr. Chilton laughs.)
- (Alana): It smells delicious.

33:09.420 --> 33:13.413
- The Romans used to kill
flamingos just to eat
their tongues.

33:13.450 --> 33:17.079
- Don't give me ideas.
Your tongue is very feisty.

33:17.120 --> 33:21.728
And as this evening has already
proven, it's nice to have
an old friend for dinner.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.092
- Mm.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.199
- I see three possibilities.
- Mm-hmm.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.437
- Gideon is
the Chesapeake Ripper,

33:35.480 --> 33:39.644
or he just thinks he is,
or he knows he isn't.

33:39.680 --> 33:44.413
- He is, he knows he is,
so do I.

33:44.450 --> 33:47.180
- Did you discuss the Chesapeake
Ripper's crimes with Dr. Gideon

33:47.220 --> 33:49.381
before he murdered
the night nurse?

33:49.420 --> 33:51.524
- Mm-hmm. When I began

33:51.560 --> 33:54.529
to suspect what he was.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.393
Fearing he might be exposed
may have, uh...

33:57.430 --> 34:00.069
spurred him into action.

34:00.100 --> 34:03.092
- Is it possible
you inadvertently planted

34:03.140 --> 34:05.665
the suggestion in Gideon's mind
that he was the Ripper?

34:05.710 --> 34:09.635
- You're not suggesting
coercive persuasion.

34:09.680 --> 34:12.569
- No, I said
inadvertently.

34:12.610 --> 34:16.512
- Psychic driving is
unethical.

34:16.550 --> 34:20.145
_ - But reasonable
in certain Circumstances.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.488
- What circumstances?

34:22.520 --> 34:26.354
- It may have been useful trying
to remind Gideon he's the
Chesapeake Ripper.

34:26.390 --> 34:29.655
- Mm-hmm.
- If he repressed
those memories.

34:31.670 --> 34:35.834
But he seems to have come
to that awareness
all by himself.

34:35.870 --> 34:38.134
- Dr. Bloom,

34:38.170 --> 34:39.808
if he has been

34:39.840 --> 34:42.809
unethically manipulated
somehow,

34:42.840 --> 34:45.400
I need to know.

34:45.450 --> 34:47.406
I would love
your in5ight.

34:47.450 --> 34:49.338
- Dr. Chilton,

34:49.380 --> 34:52.349
would you care to assist me
with dessert?

34:52.390 --> 34:54.608
- Pleasure.

34:54.660 --> 35:00.428
- I love Norton grapes.
Same color inside as outside.

35:00.460 --> 35:03.588
Peel it...

35:03.630 --> 35:06.565
and the flesh is also purple.
Not like other grapes

35:06.600 --> 35:10.536
where flesh is white
and color comes from the skin.

35:10.570 --> 35:13.368
- A grape with nothing to hide.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.872
- Were I in your position,
I would have attempted
psychic driving.

35:18.910 --> 35:22.710
Perhaps you already have.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.514
I promise

35:25.550 --> 35:29.452
I am much more forgiving
of the unorthodox
than Dr. Bloom.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.884
Shall we?

35:40.270 --> 35:43.137
(phone ringing)

35:48.580 --> 35:52.676
- [Jack. Jack, it's Miriam.]
- The last call was made

35:52.710 --> 35:55.372
to Jack's cell from
a disposable phone traced here--

35:55.420 --> 35:57.547
or within 100 feet of here.

35:57.580 --> 35:59.548
- What was Miriam Lass
looking into?

35:59.590 --> 36:01.808
- Medical records.
If the Ripper was a surgeon,

36:01.860 --> 36:04.727
she thought he might've
treated one of his victims.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.752
- Have they retraced her steps?
- The ones they could find.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.918
She made a jump somewhere
they couldn't explain.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.520
You make those jumps.

36:13.570 --> 36:16.789
- The evidence has to be there.
- Every surgeon that came
into contact with any

36:16.840 --> 36:20.401
of the Ripper victims has been
thoroughly vetted or currently
under observation.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.805
- Including Dr. Gideon?

36:21.840 --> 36:25.378
- Dr. Gideon wasn't
in my bedroom;

36:25.410 --> 36:29.346
the Chesapeake Ripper was.
The last call left

36:29.380 --> 36:31.587
something
the others didn't--

36:31.620 --> 36:34.714
a phone number.

36:37.490 --> 36:40.653
(phone ringing inside)

36:57.740 --> 37:00.538
(phone ringing)

37:40.850 --> 37:42.659
- What would be the beneﬁt

37:42.690 --> 37:45.454
of making you believe
your trainee was alive?

37:45.490 --> 37:51.690
- Hope. The Ripper wanted
to cloud my vision with hope.

37:51.730 --> 37:55.393
- It can sometimes be brave
to allow yourself hope.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.039
- Not the false kind.

38:00.070 --> 38:04.029
- Don't give up hope
for your wife. Not yet.

38:04.080 --> 38:07.277
She's lost hope,
which means you can't.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.781
- I don't have any control
over that.

38:11.820 --> 38:14.482
- Take control.

38:24.630 --> 38:26.666
I'm sorry
about your wife, Jack.

38:26.700 --> 38:28.998
I truly am.
I believe the world is

38:29.040 --> 38:31.361
a better place
with her in it.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.779
I am sorry
about your trainee.

38:37.780 --> 38:41.341
- Whatever the Ripper was doing,
it worked.

38:41.380 --> 38:46.340
I mean, I thought she was alive.
For a moment, anyway.

38:46.390 --> 38:49.917
I actually let myself believe
something that I knew
was impossible.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.655
- Talk to me about her.

38:53.660 --> 38:55.093
What was her name?

38:55.130 --> 38:57.894
- My name is Miriam Lass.
I'm with the FBI.

38:57.930 --> 39:00.490
I would show you my credentials,
but I'm actually just a trainee.

39:00.530 --> 39:04.500
- Never just a trainee.
An agent in training.

39:04.540 --> 39:07.338
Please. Come in.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.938
- I was hoping to talk to you
about a former patient--

39:11.980 --> 39:14.517
not necessarily one of yours,
but someone you may have

39:14.550 --> 39:17.917
come into contact with when
you were a practicmg thSIClan.

39:17.950 --> 39:20.783
- I haven't practiced medicine
for some time,

39:20.820 --> 39:24.426
but fortunately for you, I have
a very good memory. Please.

39:26.430 --> 39:28.489
- His name was Jeremy Olmstead.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.793
- Perhaps not so good
a memory after all.

39:33.830 --> 39:37.789
I don't recall a patient
with that name, but
it sounds familiar.

39:37.840 --> 39:42.072
- He was recently found
murdered in his workshop.
We think he may be a victim

39:42.110 --> 39:43.873
of the Chesapeake Ripper.

39:43.910 --> 39:46.799
- That's why he sounds familiar.
It was all over the news.

39:46.850 --> 39:50.411
- He had two old scars
on his thigh.

39:50.450 --> 39:53.044
Pathology checked with the local
hospital. He had fallen

39:53.090 --> 39:57.015
out of a tree-blind five years
ago while bow hunting--
stuck an arrow

39:57.060 --> 39:59.449
through his leg.
The doctor of record was

39:59.490 --> 40:02.152
a resident surgeon, but you were
on duty in the ER that night.

40:02.200 --> 40:07.092
- I was?
- Your name was
on the admi55ions log.

40:07.130 --> 40:09.530
- Let me think.

40:09.570 --> 40:11.538
You'll have to forgive me.

40:11.570 --> 40:14.607
I saw so many people in the ER,
but not so many hunters.

40:14.640 --> 40:17.473
- It's been a long time
since the accident,

40:17.510 --> 40:20.877
but I thought you may remember
if anything was fishy
with the arrow wound.

40:20.910 --> 40:23.470
- If it's the gentleman
I'm thinking of,

40:23.520 --> 40:26.080
I vaguely remember
a fellow hunter bringing him in,

40:26.120 --> 40:28.111
but _I recall
very little else.

40:28.150 --> 40:31.586
- Figured it was
a long shot.

40:34.090 --> 40:37.457
- I did keep detailed journals
during those days.

40:37.500 --> 40:41.732
If you like, I can get them
for you. Maybe you'll find
something helpful.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.965
- That would be great--
if you don't mind.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.208
- Not at all. If you'll wait
here, I'll be right back.

40:50.540 --> 40:51.939
- Thank you.

42:05.620 --> 42:08.885
- She was a very brave
young woman.
