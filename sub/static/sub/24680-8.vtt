00:02.135 --> 00:05.171
In New York City's war on crime,

00:05.171 --> 00:08.080
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.080 --> 00:09.609
of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.407
These are their stories.

00:14.084 --> 00:15.502
They want it to end, Laura.

00:15.502 --> 00:18.772
It's not about the money.

00:18.772 --> 00:20.675
Honey, we have to let go.

00:20.675 --> 00:24.675
Well, maybe you can, but I can't.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.869
It's the heart of this community.
It's part of this community.

00:28.869 --> 00:31.050
You people don't seem to understand that.

00:31.050 --> 00:32.543
"You people"?

00:32.543 --> 00:36.803
Well, I hope you're there tomorrow
to tell "us people" that to our faces.

00:40.903 --> 00:44.415
How dare they!

00:44.415 --> 00:47.779
Rob, look at this.

00:47.779 --> 00:51.542
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
How much is Satan paying you?

00:52.042 --> 00:55.614
The church exercised their
last option five years ago.

00:55.614 --> 00:58.272
Nobody thought it would come to this.

00:58.272 --> 01:01.475
Hello, Mike. Where's Laura?

01:01.475 --> 01:04.458
Uh, she's still in the car.

01:04.458 --> 01:08.458
I'll go get her.

01:10.009 --> 01:13.237
Oh, Laura.

01:13.237 --> 01:17.135
- Sometimes I just can't stop.
- I know, I know.

01:17.635 --> 01:19.211
Everything all right, Ms. Hendrix?

01:19.211 --> 01:22.986
Yes, Connie. Thanks.

01:22.986 --> 01:26.744
Come on.
I'll buy you a sugar-free cookie.

01:26.744 --> 01:28.512
Okay.

01:30.217 --> 01:32.305
Like most of you,
Ginny and I don't want to join

01:32.305 --> 01:35.185
some big congregation off the island.

01:35.185 --> 01:39.185
That's not why we moved here to raise our kids.

01:39.718 --> 01:43.683
The Owners'Association wants to preserve
the character of this community, too,

01:43.683 --> 01:45.342
but it takes money.

01:45.342 --> 01:47.014
The city won't pay for improvements.

01:47.014 --> 01:49.713
The only thing you want to improve is your checkbook.

01:49.713 --> 01:52.247
How big a kickback you gettin'?

01:52.247 --> 01:54.950
Henry, that is a low blow.

01:54.950 --> 01:57.460
Well, at least he's not hiding.

01:57.460 --> 02:01.906
I want to know the coward who sent this.

02:01.906 --> 02:03.812
Dr. Ricci.!

02:03.812 --> 02:06.054
Dr. Ricci, there's something wrong with Laura.

02:06.054 --> 02:10.054
She's in the bathroom.
I think she's done something to herself.

02:12.115 --> 02:14.058
Get her started on norepinephrine.

02:14.058 --> 02:17.001
- Four megs, five percent.
- Yes, Doctor.

02:17.001 --> 02:21.046
Mr. Koehler,
we're treating your wife for poisoning,

02:21.046 --> 02:24.307
but we don't yet know what she ingested.

02:24.307 --> 02:27.390
Now, you told the nurse
you think she attempted suicide.

02:27.390 --> 02:29.516
Yeah, she's had a hard time lately.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.975
We have a suspected poisoning.

02:30.975 --> 02:32.896
Male, 73. B.P.'s crashed.

02:32.896 --> 02:35.119
Ipecac and lavage.
Let's get some blood.

02:35.119 --> 02:37.631
I'm sorry. Do you have any idea
what your wife might have taken?

02:37.631 --> 02:39.555
No. / Doctor, there's an ambulance
en route with another poisoning.

02:39.555 --> 02:41.540
- The patient's unresponsive.
- Call St. Lucia's.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.574
- Tell them we might need to transfer...
- Somebody help me!

02:43.574 --> 02:45.215
My wife's in the car.
She can't breathe.

02:45.215 --> 02:49.685
She's having convulsions.
Please help her!

Law & Order CI 
3x08 Sound Bodies

03:33.795 --> 03:36.372
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/11/16

03:39.223 --> 03:41.313
Since last night,
there have been two more cases.

03:41.313 --> 03:44.846
That brings it to three dead, two in
a coma and four in critical condition.

03:44.846 --> 03:48.520
- All from arsenic?
- Right. The first victim, Laura Koehler,

03:48.520 --> 03:50.056
she's one of the deceased.

03:50.056 --> 03:51.623
Her husband thought it was a suicide.

03:51.623 --> 03:52.876
Then the others rolled in.

03:52.876 --> 03:55.067
The common denominator's
a meeting yesterday afternoon.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.160
They served food and drink?

03:56.160 --> 03:59.715
Yes. The reverend's wife was in charge of that.

03:59.715 --> 04:03.671
One of the injured got this in the mail.

04:03.671 --> 04:06.122
You caught yourself a live one.

04:06.122 --> 04:08.778
"How much is Satan paying you?"

04:08.778 --> 04:12.104
So much for reasoned debate.

04:12.604 --> 04:14.323
I bought the cookies from the island bakery.

04:14.323 --> 04:16.901
I made the coffee and the iced tea myself in the kitchenette.

04:16.901 --> 04:18.149
Didn't anyone help you?

04:18.149 --> 04:20.480
Some young girls from the parish.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.157
Uh, the meeting,
what was the controversy?

04:24.157 --> 04:27.139
The church is losing its lease.

04:27.139 --> 04:31.326
The Channel Island trustees want
to sell the land to a condo developer.

04:31.326 --> 04:33.221
Well, the island isn't big enough.

04:33.221 --> 04:36.147
I mean, there'd be no place
for the church to move to.

04:36.147 --> 04:38.093
That's right.

04:38.093 --> 04:40.953
One of the victims got this letter.

04:40.953 --> 04:44.304
I assume that she was for selling the property.

04:44.304 --> 04:46.735
Yes. Her husband, Rob, is a trustee.

04:46.735 --> 04:48.930
I don't agree with them,
but they're good people.

04:48.930 --> 04:52.089
Uh, what about the other victims on this list?

04:52.089 --> 04:53.359
Where did they stand?

04:53.359 --> 04:56.590
George Tooley, he was for the sale.

04:56.590 --> 04:59.100
Old Henry Leavitt,

04:59.100 --> 05:01.062
he was against.

05:01.062 --> 05:03.230
Laura Koehler,
I think she was against.

05:03.230 --> 05:07.870
For, for. Against.

05:10.894 --> 05:14.894
So much for narrowing the field.

05:16.364 --> 05:20.098
The lab found arsenic in 12
coffee cups retrieved from the trash.

05:20.098 --> 05:22.043
All the tainted coffee had artificial sweetener,

05:22.043 --> 05:24.170
as did the stomach contents of the victims.

05:24.170 --> 05:28.076
Someone could have steam-opened
the packets of sweetener and then resealed them.

05:28.576 --> 05:32.100
What about leftover packets?
Any of them tampered with?

05:32.100 --> 05:35.082
No, but the poisoner might've
picked them up at the end of the meeting.

05:35.082 --> 05:37.229
The victims were on both sides of the issue.

05:37.229 --> 05:40.396
The only thing they had in common
was artificial sweetener.

05:40.396 --> 05:42.851
The killer was targeting people on diets?

05:42.851 --> 05:44.673
Maybe not all of them were targets.

05:44.673 --> 05:46.920
There's one victim whose life
depended on avoiding sugar.

05:46.920 --> 05:50.377
Laura Koehler.

05:50.377 --> 05:51.708
She was a diabetic.

05:51.708 --> 05:55.955
The one whose husband was
pushing the suicide scenario.

05:55.955 --> 05:58.106
Home of Michael & Laura Koehler
Channel Island, New York
Wednesday, May 21

05:58.106 --> 06:01.566
When you found your wife unconscious,
you didn't suspect her diabetes?

06:01.566 --> 06:05.683
No, because she was always so careful.

06:05.683 --> 06:08.913
And suicide was more likely?

06:08.913 --> 06:10.367
Had she tried before?

06:10.367 --> 06:16.811
No, but things had gotten very difficult for her lately.

06:19.997 --> 06:24.505
We lost our son Brian in a drowning accident.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.985
Oh.

06:28.828 --> 06:31.817
That's right. I remember seeing
his photo in the newspaper.

06:31.817 --> 06:33.736
It was four months ago.

06:33.736 --> 06:35.820
Your son and two other boys,

06:35.820 --> 06:39.820
they were taking a boat to Hart Island.

06:41.140 --> 06:43.685
There's... There's a lawsuit,
isn't there, against the State?

06:43.685 --> 06:47.075
You and the other parents
are suing over the 911 system?

06:47.075 --> 06:50.858
Brian tried to call 911 on his cell phone
when the boat started sinking.

06:51.358 --> 06:55.358
But those people, they never sent help.

06:56.092 --> 06:58.055
Are you suing anyone else?

06:58.055 --> 07:00.405
McCarter's Marina.

07:00.405 --> 07:03.287
That's where they got the boat from.

07:03.287 --> 07:07.287
That rotted-out rowboat.

07:08.911 --> 07:12.911
Can we see the documentation on the lawsuit?

07:15.699 --> 07:19.699
Help yourself.

07:22.161 --> 07:26.895
You said that things had gotten
difficult for your wife.

07:26.895 --> 07:29.364
We got an offer to settle.

07:29.364 --> 07:30.841
There was a lot of pressure.

07:30.841 --> 07:34.841
- From the other parents?
- Yes. Brian could have been saved.

07:35.796 --> 07:38.311
They all could have.

07:38.311 --> 07:41.002
Is this your wife's handwriting?

07:41.002 --> 07:44.648
- Yes.
- Most of the notes are hers.

07:45.148 --> 07:48.717
She was the driving force, wasn't she?

07:49.217 --> 07:51.241
She's the one that didn't want to settle.

07:51.241 --> 07:53.714
Laura wanted them punished.

07:53.714 --> 07:57.428
Anyone who had anything
to do with Brian's death,

07:57.428 --> 08:01.092
she wanted them punished.

08:01.592 --> 08:03.830
Like it's anybody's fault.
Those kids were stupid.

08:03.830 --> 08:06.280
I mean, stealing a rowboat from the repair yard.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.942
What did they expect?

08:07.942 --> 08:11.340
- And the boat was behind that fence?
- Uh-huh. It was takin' on water.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.351
Saturday afternoon, you
or any of the other guys

08:14.351 --> 08:16.107
go to St. Brendan's for the meeting?

08:16.107 --> 08:19.676
Saturday afternoon we spent scraping that sloop.

08:19.676 --> 08:27.152
You know, this photo was taken
the day after the drowning.

08:27.152 --> 08:29.828
See these drag marks?

08:29.828 --> 08:36.860
They say the boys pushed
the rowboat into the water from,

08:36.860 --> 08:39.400
well, I'd say right about here.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.807
Yeah, but that boat wasn't here.

08:40.807 --> 08:43.505
It was in the yard behind the fence.

08:43.505 --> 08:45.038
Well, maybe it's a different boat.

08:45.038 --> 08:47.738
No, it's the same boat.
The harbor cops found it.

08:47.738 --> 08:50.906
That's Hart Island, huh?
That's where they were heading.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.095
On account of the cemetery.

08:52.095 --> 08:55.098
Kids think it's fun to drink and
carry on with the dead,

08:55.098 --> 08:58.535
the little heathen bastards.

08:59.035 --> 09:02.096
This, uh, leaky rowboat...

09:02.096 --> 09:04.873
it would've started taking
on water as soon as they set off.

09:04.873 --> 09:06.817
There would've been three inches
of water on the bottom...

09:06.817 --> 09:09.208
before they even reached the end of that dock.

09:09.208 --> 09:13.208
I don't see why they kept on going.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.175
I can't tell you how sorry we are, Mike.

09:23.175 --> 09:24.952
Thank you.

09:24.952 --> 09:27.527
You come over for dinner this weekend.

09:27.527 --> 09:31.527
Well, you see how you feel.

09:33.764 --> 09:35.853
Listen, Mike, about the settlement...

09:35.853 --> 09:38.262
we'd all feel better if it's unanimous.

09:38.262 --> 09:40.308
- We know how Laura felt...
- No, it's all right,

09:40.308 --> 09:41.150
it's all right, it's all right.

09:41.150 --> 09:45.150
Just tell the lawyers I'll sign off. It's fine.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.301
Mrs. Koehler was...

09:53.301 --> 09:55.734
so nice to me, sir.

09:55.734 --> 09:59.734
I know she liked you.

10:06.797 --> 10:10.103
I passed the photos of
the marina employees around.

10:10.103 --> 10:11.607
No one saw them at St. Brendan's.

10:11.607 --> 10:14.216
Well, they'd have been there
if St. Brendan's had happy hour.

10:14.216 --> 10:18.216
I ran their sheets.
Mostly drunk and disorderlies, bar fights.

10:20.577 --> 10:22.011
Want me to stick a dart in him?

10:22.011 --> 10:27.184
No. He's listening to the tape of
the 911 call the kids made from the boat.

10:30.002 --> 10:33.439
L-I need to see the boat.

10:33.439 --> 10:35.887
We were storing it in case there was a trial,

10:35.887 --> 10:38.907
but I got word yesterday
that the parties settled.

10:38.907 --> 10:41.889
Someone worried the boat'll float away?

10:41.889 --> 10:43.587
Can't be too sure.

10:43.587 --> 10:45.975
Last place we had it,
someone tried to break in.

10:45.975 --> 10:47.536
911.
What is your emergency?

10:47.536 --> 10:49.956
Our boat's filling up with water!
You gotta send help.!

10:49.956 --> 10:51.248
- What is your location?
- I don't know.

10:51.248 --> 10:53.253
Off Channel Island, 200 yards.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.767
It just started, and it started leaking
in the front. It's leaking like crazy!

10:56.767 --> 10:58.852
- Sir, I need a location.
- Channel Island!

10:58.852 --> 11:00.568
The front of the boat is filling up!

11:00.568 --> 11:04.567
Help us! We're sinking!
We're gonna drown! Help!

11:04.567 --> 11:09.811
Those kids, two minutes in that
freezing water, they were done for.

11:09.811 --> 11:14.195
The wood along the seams
has been rotted out.

11:14.195 --> 11:17.868
This boat should've sank like
a stone as soon as it hit the water.

11:18.650 --> 11:22.650
And there's a kind of... residue...

11:25.237 --> 11:29.237
stuck in the cracks.

11:36.342 --> 11:39.802
Um, uh, cake frosting...

11:40.302 --> 11:44.302
and something else.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.808
It's white glue.

11:49.808 --> 11:54.095
Someone patched the seams with
a mixture of frosting and glue.

11:54.095 --> 11:57.179
Wouldn't frosting dissolve
on contact with water?

11:57.179 --> 11:59.018
That's why they used the glue.

11:59.018 --> 12:02.324
It... It hardens.

12:02.324 --> 12:04.301
It would protect the patches

12:04.301 --> 12:08.301
just long enough for
the boat to get far from shore.

12:12.109 --> 12:14.378
Too far to swim back.

12:14.378 --> 12:17.134
Someone wanted it to sink.

12:17.134 --> 12:19.723
They moved the boat from the repair yard,

12:19.723 --> 12:21.628
they patched it up,

12:21.628 --> 12:23.999
put it where the kids would find it,

12:23.999 --> 12:27.999
knowing that it would never
be able to cross the sound.

12:30.297 --> 12:34.100
Those kids were murdered.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.625
Sabotage?
Somebody killed our boys?

12:36.625 --> 12:40.653
Yes. This person might have been worried
the sabotage would be discovered...

12:40.653 --> 12:43.392
if your lawsuit went to trial.

12:43.392 --> 12:45.982
We believe that's why Laura was killed.

12:45.982 --> 12:48.414
Oh, God.

12:48.414 --> 12:50.278
She didn't want to settle.
She wanted it to go to trial.

12:50.278 --> 12:51.976
That's what you told us.

12:51.976 --> 12:53.531
They were headed to the cemetery.

12:53.531 --> 12:57.043
Do you know if they had any
interest in Satanism or witchcraft?

12:57.043 --> 12:59.147
No! These were just average kids.

12:59.147 --> 13:00.725
Maybe we could ask their girlfriends.

13:00.725 --> 13:03.225
Brian wasn't seeing anyone in particular.

13:03.225 --> 13:05.258
And John wasn't either.
He said these days

13:05.258 --> 13:09.258
it wasn't cool to go steady with any one person.

13:10.134 --> 13:13.546
All right. Thank you all for coming in.

13:13.546 --> 13:17.546
The officer will show you downstairs.

13:22.652 --> 13:25.144
I'd hate to think we put 'em
through that for nothing.

13:25.144 --> 13:26.579
Any luck tracing the arsenic?

13:26.579 --> 13:30.192
The lab can't match it to any
commercial arsenic currently available.

13:30.192 --> 13:33.742
I'm looking at Brian Koehler's autopsy.

13:33.742 --> 13:37.273
He had gonorrhea.

13:37.273 --> 13:40.764
So did his other two friends.

13:40.764 --> 13:44.437
Now, what are the odds of three 17-year-olds...

13:44.437 --> 13:48.230
having the same sexually transmitted disease?

13:48.230 --> 13:49.998
Office of Medical Examiner
Monday, May 26

13:49.998 --> 13:52.371
The gonorrhea of all three boys had the same D.N.A.

13:52.371 --> 13:53.884
Could they have gotten it from each other?

13:53.884 --> 13:57.884
It's doubtful. Autopsies showed
no rectal or oral infection.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.533
Well, they got it from the same girl.

14:01.533 --> 14:05.533
Unless toilet seats and doorknobs
are making a comeback.

14:07.363 --> 14:09.164
Three boys with the same girl.

14:09.164 --> 14:10.192
What if it was rape?

14:10.192 --> 14:11.831
They might have been murdered in revenge.

14:11.831 --> 14:13.222
We need to find this girl.

14:13.222 --> 14:15.810
She probably didn't file a rape
complaint against any of the boys.

14:15.810 --> 14:18.914
We would've heard about it.

14:18.914 --> 14:20.266
The church meeting.

14:20.266 --> 14:24.266
There were a couple of girls
helping with the coffee and cookies.

14:24.767 --> 14:28.110
I've known Tina and Carolyn since
they were in the children's choir.

14:28.110 --> 14:28.876
I'm sure they're not...

14:28.876 --> 14:33.221
I'm wondering what kind of kid would
give up their Saturday afternoon

14:33.221 --> 14:35.269
for a church function.
You don't pay them, do you?

14:35.269 --> 14:36.642
No. They volunteered.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.255
Do they belong to a church group?

14:38.255 --> 14:40.448
Tina did until a few months ago.

14:40.448 --> 14:43.663
She was an altar girl.
She helped with our youth outreach.

14:43.663 --> 14:49.078
- She had a child's devotion to God.
- And that... that changed?

14:49.078 --> 14:50.799
She got the teenage blues, I guess.

14:50.799 --> 14:53.704
She just stopped coming to church.

14:53.704 --> 14:56.606
And that was around the time
that the boys drowned?

14:56.606 --> 14:59.118
No, a few weeks before.

14:59.118 --> 15:02.224
But now she seems her old self again.
Very happy.

15:02.224 --> 15:05.622
Whatever was bothering
her worked itself out.

15:06.122 --> 15:09.049
I didn't see anybody mess with the food.

15:09.049 --> 15:12.747
But I wasn't watching the whole time.

15:13.247 --> 15:17.235
Okay, Tina. That about covers it.

15:17.735 --> 15:24.210
Mrs. Hale said that you had
drifted away from the church for a while.

15:26.490 --> 15:30.490
I did the same thing when I was her age.

15:31.342 --> 15:33.746
You know, I just couldn't see
what all that stuffhad

15:33.746 --> 15:37.746
to do with my life anymore, you know.

15:38.848 --> 15:41.382
Is that what happened to you, Tina?

15:41.382 --> 15:44.586
I just needed some space.

15:44.586 --> 15:48.586
Did something make you realize that?

15:49.463 --> 15:52.464
Nothing in particular.

15:52.464 --> 15:56.464
Was it those boys drowning?

16:02.836 --> 16:06.836
Did you think that God didn't care?

16:07.509 --> 16:09.757
He let your friends die.

16:09.757 --> 16:12.962
I didn't hang with those guys.

16:12.962 --> 16:15.270
Why not?

16:15.270 --> 16:18.278
They're delta heads.

16:18.278 --> 16:22.278
You know, like totally asleep up there.

16:23.032 --> 16:25.252
There are three levels of sleep:

16:25.252 --> 16:33.080
Alpha, theta and delta.
That's like... deep sleep.

16:37.060 --> 16:40.183
Where'd you learn that?

16:40.183 --> 16:44.183
I don't know.

16:46.543 --> 16:53.055
Um...So what made you
stop going to church?

16:53.055 --> 16:55.464
Did something happen to you, Tina?

16:55.464 --> 16:59.464
Something Brian and the other boys did?

17:00.461 --> 17:04.461
- No. I needed some space.
- All right, that's enough.

17:05.371 --> 17:09.371
Tina, you're excused.

17:12.422 --> 17:16.035
Where did you get this idea that
my daughter was raped?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.632
She would've come to us.

17:17.632 --> 17:19.698
Has she seen a doctor
in the last five months?

17:19.698 --> 17:23.178
She's been to the gynecologist.

17:23.178 --> 17:27.178
What is it you want with my daughter?

17:28.309 --> 17:30.682
I see.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.272
You're getting out of our house.

17:32.272 --> 17:36.272
We're hiring a lawyer.

17:38.270 --> 17:42.270
There is another way to connect her to the boys.

17:42.780 --> 17:45.596
By law, doctors, including Tina's,

17:45.596 --> 17:49.596
have to report every case of gonorrhea
to the Department of Health.

17:51.022 --> 17:52.507
Yes, no doubt.

17:52.507 --> 17:56.325
It worked exactly like you said.
Like you knew.

17:56.825 --> 18:01.128
Okay. I'll tell them.

18:01.128 --> 18:02.480
He wants us to meet him.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.720
Now?
But it's late. My dad's still up.

18:05.720 --> 18:09.720
Oh, unclench, Claudia.

18:11.922 --> 18:15.312
Claudia, he's waiting.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.979
Department of Health Bronx
New York, Tuesday, May 27

18:24.979 --> 18:28.468
We've interviewed 35 kids from
Channel Island so far.

18:28.468 --> 18:31.183
Most of them have had
multiple sexual partners.

18:31.183 --> 18:34.978
The contacts just keep going into
wider and wider circles.

18:34.978 --> 18:38.686
We made a chart.

18:38.686 --> 18:40.079
Each circle is a kid.

18:40.079 --> 18:42.206
Each line is a sexual contact.

18:42.206 --> 18:45.198
Kids told us they've participated in
every type of sexual activity.

18:45.198 --> 18:49.075
Group sex, you name it.
Everything except male-to-male contact.

18:49.075 --> 18:50.571
The three dead boys were involved?

18:50.571 --> 18:51.636
Yes, very much so.

18:51.636 --> 18:52.688
And Tina Walker?

18:52.688 --> 18:55.203
She wasn't infected,
but she was named as a participant.

18:55.203 --> 18:58.550
One of these circles is her.

18:58.550 --> 19:01.962
You're looking at every parent's nightmare.

19:01.962 --> 19:04.390
And maybe a breeding
ground for three murders.

19:04.390 --> 19:07.900
This is some little community.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.273
You're not in trouble, Liv.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.872
They just want to ask you...
about the other kids

19:10.872 --> 19:13.609
who participated in the sex parties.

19:13.609 --> 19:17.320
Liv, there were three boys
involved with the sex parties.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.244
Way more than three.

19:19.244 --> 19:21.389
It was like a mad sex thing.

19:21.389 --> 19:27.749
We want to know specifically about these three.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.811
They ever force girls to participate?

19:30.811 --> 19:32.854
Nobody was forced.

19:32.854 --> 19:35.946
You do it because your friends do it.
You want to be tight.

19:35.946 --> 19:38.479
You don't want to be by yourself.

19:38.479 --> 19:40.758
Afterwards, how did they...

19:40.758 --> 19:42.828
treat you?
Were they nice or...

19:42.828 --> 19:44.731
They were mean.

19:44.731 --> 19:47.302
Like you weren't anything important.

19:47.302 --> 19:50.099
But what are you gonna do?

19:50.099 --> 19:52.489
Tina Walker and Carolyn James,

19:52.489 --> 19:53.901
did they have sex with them?

19:53.901 --> 19:57.332
They used to be really into it.

19:57.332 --> 19:59.538
They stopped before the boys drowned?

19:59.538 --> 20:02.945
Uh-huh. I think theyjust got sick of it.

20:02.945 --> 20:05.458
Have you talked to Tina or Carolyn since?

20:05.458 --> 20:09.596
No. They're tight.
We call them T.L.C.,

20:09.596 --> 20:13.126
like "Three Lame Chicks."

20:13.126 --> 20:14.704
Who's number three?

20:14.704 --> 20:17.420
Claudia Goodman.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.968
Island Kennel
Channel Island, New York
Thursday, May 29

20:19.968 --> 20:22.860
Yeah, I used to go to those parties,
but I stopped.

20:22.860 --> 20:24.393
I really don't like talking about it.

20:24.393 --> 20:26.254
Your friends,
Tina and Carolyn,

20:26.254 --> 20:28.176
did they help you decide to stop?

20:28.176 --> 20:31.668
No. I just got control of myself.

20:31.668 --> 20:34.253
- Is that doggie vitamins?
- Supplements.

20:34.253 --> 20:38.253
This one's for their joints,
so they don't get arthritis.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.518
You said that you got yourself under control.

20:45.518 --> 20:48.152
I was wondering how you did that.

20:48.152 --> 20:51.487
Well, uh, you relax and concentrate...

20:51.987 --> 20:55.771
and make a picture in your mind of
what you want to happen.

20:56.271 --> 20:58.621
That sounds so simple.

20:58.621 --> 21:00.787
And when you were relaxed,

21:00.787 --> 21:02.810
did you count backwards from 100,

21:02.810 --> 21:07.195
or did you imagine going down an escalator?

21:07.195 --> 21:11.195
An escalator, yeah.

21:11.889 --> 21:15.530
You have electric bug zappers.

21:16.030 --> 21:18.726
You know, this technique,

21:18.726 --> 21:21.239
where'd you learn it?

21:21.239 --> 21:23.017
Did you read it in a book or...

21:23.017 --> 21:25.613
Uh, no, I just figured it out myself.

21:25.613 --> 21:27.067
There's nothing up there.

21:27.067 --> 21:30.025
I just like old barns.

21:30.025 --> 21:34.868
Oh, my God. What a little cutie pie.
Can I hold him?

21:36.000 --> 21:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

21:43.977 --> 21:46.581
- You like working with animals?
- Yes.

21:46.581 --> 21:49.788
They don't use you like some people do.

21:49.788 --> 21:52.808
We heard that the boys
treated the girls like trash,

21:52.808 --> 21:54.731
especially Brian Koehler.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.529
You girls must've hated him.

21:56.529 --> 21:58.436
I don't hate anybody.

21:58.436 --> 22:00.094
If I hated someone,

22:00.094 --> 22:03.623
I'd be hating something
in them that's a part of me.

22:03.623 --> 22:06.981
Wow. That's a great insight.

22:07.481 --> 22:09.129
You know, a neighbor of mine named Syd

22:09.129 --> 22:11.455
comes up with great stuff like that all the time.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.911
Old Mr. Syd Arthur.
You ever hear of him?

22:13.911 --> 22:17.236
No.

22:17.236 --> 22:19.608
I'm joking with you a little bit, Claudia.

22:19.608 --> 22:23.608
Siddhartha, it's a book.

22:25.949 --> 22:28.012
Thanks.

22:29.850 --> 22:33.850
He really is cute.

22:39.367 --> 22:43.367
We need to take this to the lab.
It's antique flypaper.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.817
The lab matched the arsenic in the coffee cups

22:46.817 --> 22:49.250
with the arsenic on the flypaper.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.083
I thought they stopped using arsenic in flypaper.

22:51.083 --> 22:53.349
In the late '70s.
The barn was older than that.

22:53.349 --> 22:54.903
So was the flypaper.

22:54.903 --> 22:57.583
So these girls, what,
boiled the flypaper to get the arsenic?

22:57.583 --> 22:59.180
They might've had some help.

22:59.180 --> 23:00.859
Claudia, what she said about hate,

23:00.859 --> 23:03.211
came straight out of this book.

23:03.211 --> 23:06.093
Siddhartha. I haven't thought about
that book in 30 years.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.968
What Tina said about
the different stages of sleep,

23:08.968 --> 23:11.034
it's from this book about self-hypnosis.

23:11.034 --> 23:13.078
They said they didn't get it from a book.

23:13.078 --> 23:14.682
Well, somebody else probably did and

23:14.682 --> 23:17.875
passed it off as their original thought.

23:17.875 --> 23:20.999
They didn't tell us because...

23:20.999 --> 23:23.800
they didn't want us to know
about their clever friend.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.133
Maybe this friend was clever enough
to extract arsenic from flypaper.

23:27.133 --> 23:29.992
And make a boat sink in the middle
of Long Island Sound.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.491
It's a small island. Find him.

23:32.491 --> 23:35.107
Home of REV. & MRS. Hale
Channel Island, New York
Monday, June 2

23:35.107 --> 23:37.344
Are you Conroy?
Conroy Smith?

23:37.344 --> 23:41.658
Connie. You're the detectives, right?

23:41.658 --> 23:43.781
That's right; we're the detectives.

23:43.781 --> 23:46.624
Yeah, I saw you talking
to my aunt last week.

23:46.624 --> 23:50.272
The reverend's my uncle.

23:50.272 --> 23:51.807
You live here year round?

23:51.807 --> 23:53.874
My mom travels all the time.

23:53.874 --> 23:57.716
She has important work to do.

23:58.216 --> 24:02.216
Um, you got these books from the library?

24:02.765 --> 24:04.502
The library told you what books I read?

24:04.502 --> 24:07.931
One of those post 9/11
erosions of civil liberties.

24:07.931 --> 24:10.114
Yeah, we've got your
whole reading list here:

24:10.114 --> 24:13.666
Hermann Hesse, Carlos Castaneda,
Kahlil Gibran.

24:14.166 --> 24:17.250
Just take from them what I can use.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.232
I'm sure you do.

24:19.232 --> 24:23.232
This stuff is worlds away from
what your classmates are into.

24:25.489 --> 24:27.402
Sex parties.

24:27.402 --> 24:29.225
Those people are pathetic.

24:29.225 --> 24:31.348
You didn't participate?

24:31.348 --> 24:34.787
There's no wrong in love, but...

24:35.287 --> 24:38.270
there was no love at those parties.

24:38.270 --> 24:42.657
Just bodies using... and being used.

24:44.032 --> 24:45.934
Excuse me.

24:45.934 --> 24:49.098
Hey, you're forgetting your dinner.

24:49.098 --> 24:50.980
What've you got in here?

24:50.980 --> 24:54.326
Weakfish, stripers.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.634
Hey, you know, I guess since
you don't party with those other kids,

24:57.634 --> 25:00.575
you spend a lot of time by yourself, huh?

25:00.575 --> 25:04.575
It's cool. I'm content with myself.

25:06.670 --> 25:09.344
You must have some friends.

25:09.344 --> 25:13.057
Tina Walker? Claudia Goodman?

25:13.557 --> 25:16.831
I mean, it's thanks to them,
we found you.

25:16.831 --> 25:19.651
They told us things right out of these books,

25:19.651 --> 25:23.187
except they never read them.

25:23.687 --> 25:26.083
You, on the other hand,

25:26.083 --> 25:29.000
you have read them.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.412
In fact, in the last four years,

25:31.412 --> 25:32.710
you're the only person on the island

25:32.710 --> 25:34.872
who's checked both of
these out from the library.

25:34.872 --> 25:38.366
Probably the only person in the city.

25:38.366 --> 25:42.366
You're busting my ass
because I read books?

25:43.259 --> 25:47.016
Books are why my mother
sent me to live with my uncle,

25:47.016 --> 25:50.461
so I could grow up in
a house full of ideas,

25:50.461 --> 25:54.461
rather than toys and television.

25:56.212 --> 25:59.277
She was looking after her special boy.

25:59.277 --> 26:02.195
She tell you that?

26:02.195 --> 26:05.378
That you're special?

26:05.378 --> 26:09.378
My mother told me to expect
great things from myself.

26:11.857 --> 26:15.203
Hey, l... I caught a four-pound striper.

26:15.203 --> 26:17.677
Great. Everything okay?

26:17.677 --> 26:18.987
Sure.

26:20.298 --> 26:23.509
Your nephew's an interesting kid.

26:23.509 --> 26:26.367
He's well-read.

26:26.367 --> 26:30.367
He's always trying to broaden his horizons.

26:31.975 --> 26:33.903
He told us his mother does important work,

26:33.903 --> 26:37.627
and that's why he lives here with you.

26:38.127 --> 26:42.073
My sister was 17 when she had him.

26:42.573 --> 26:46.547
When he was 10, she left him
here for a long weekend.

26:47.047 --> 26:51.047
She never came back.
Last I heard, she was in Nevada.

26:52.972 --> 26:56.972
Well, he's following in your footsteps,
not hers. Uh...

26:59.922 --> 27:03.387
- powdered dental stone?
- It's Connie's.

27:03.387 --> 27:09.904
He was using it to make casts of
tire prints for one of his classes.

27:09.904 --> 27:11.988
Uh, I have work to do.

27:11.988 --> 27:15.538
Sure. Um, we'll find our way back.

27:15.538 --> 27:17.885
Thanks.

27:19.751 --> 27:21.929
You want to go to class?

27:21.929 --> 27:24.208
H.S 443, Bronx, New York
Monday, June 2

27:24.208 --> 27:26.296
Crime detection classes?

27:26.296 --> 27:28.846
Does someone think these kids need
more exposure to crime?

27:28.846 --> 27:29.813
Oh, please.

27:29.813 --> 27:33.081
If I can shove a little science along with
the gore into their heads, why not?

27:33.081 --> 27:36.105
Are you studying methods, cases?
Anything involving arsenics?

27:36.105 --> 27:38.881
Yes. Florence Maybrick.

27:38.881 --> 27:42.881
Oh, her husband was
rumored to beJack the Ripper.

27:43.691 --> 27:47.341
She poisoned him with arsenic

27:47.841 --> 27:51.433
she got...by using flypaper...
boiling flypaper.

27:51.433 --> 27:52.700
That's the one.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.667
What has Connie been studying lately?

27:54.667 --> 27:56.549
We had a class yesterday afternoon.

27:56.549 --> 27:59.388
When I came in, he was already
on the computer, checking our database.

27:59.388 --> 28:03.388
- What specifically?
- Let me see.

28:06.626 --> 28:10.510
He looked up cases of
death from anaphylactic shock.

28:11.010 --> 28:15.010
Allergic reactions.
He's learning.

28:15.939 --> 28:19.939
This is not a sad moment.

28:20.828 --> 28:23.285
There's no better moment than

28:23.285 --> 28:26.285
when you're setting something free.

28:32.361 --> 28:35.402
Relax.

28:35.402 --> 28:39.402
Think about that place where we're going.

28:41.213 --> 28:45.213
You'll get there before we do.

28:53.292 --> 28:57.067
This is nice. One woman with
a rare allergy nearly died...

28:57.067 --> 29:01.210
when her ex-husband smeared
shampoo on her door handle.

29:01.210 --> 29:04.351
I can't believe this is
what kids are studying in school.

29:04.351 --> 29:07.374
Well, at least they're learning about
the history of allergies.

29:07.374 --> 29:09.641
Richard III and strawberries.

29:09.641 --> 29:11.483
And here's a real kiss of death.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.975
A woman with a shellfish allergy
went into shock...

29:13.975 --> 29:17.515
when her boyfriend kissed her
after eating shrimp.

29:18.015 --> 29:20.042
Shellfish.

29:20.844 --> 29:24.515
I read that some arthritis medication...

29:24.515 --> 29:27.942
is made from shellfish.

29:27.942 --> 29:31.887
Here. Chondroitin sulfate.

29:32.387 --> 29:35.248
Made from shellfish.

29:35.248 --> 29:41.036
Available in pills and liquid form for pets.

29:41.797 --> 29:45.797
Must be the same stuff Claudia
was putting in the dog food.

29:48.197 --> 29:50.290
Well, Claudia probably told him
that we were talking to her.

29:50.290 --> 29:54.290
Next thing, he's researching anaphylactic shock.

29:54.999 --> 29:57.685
We should call her parents,
see if she's allergic.

29:57.685 --> 30:01.685
We'll do it on the way there.

30:05.878 --> 30:09.878
She's up here!

30:14.012 --> 30:18.012
I got a pulse.

30:23.851 --> 30:27.289
Chondroitin sulfate.

30:27.789 --> 30:29.608
It's a suicide note.

30:29.608 --> 30:33.608
She's taking the blame for
the arsenic poisonings.

30:37.150 --> 30:40.974
Little bastard.

30:41.474 --> 30:43.989
Nobody put me up to anything.

30:43.989 --> 30:46.866
I got the poison from the flypaper
and put it in the sweeteners.

30:46.866 --> 30:50.174
What did you do with the poison
packets that didn't get used?

30:50.174 --> 30:52.624
Took 'em back after the meeting.

30:52.624 --> 30:55.524
And you could tell which ones were
poisoned, which ones weren't?

30:55.524 --> 30:57.875
Yes, okay?

30:57.875 --> 30:59.960
These people are such hypocrites.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.960
Like being all holy, and they don't care
if their kids are having orgies.

31:06.355 --> 31:08.805
This is a whole different side of you, Claudia.

31:08.805 --> 31:11.663
I thought you told us you didn't hate anyone.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.932
I can show you any side I want.

31:13.932 --> 31:16.042
None of it's real anyway.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.469
It's just what's inside me.

31:18.469 --> 31:21.941
And what's in her head is
Connie Smith's regurgitated philosophies.

31:21.941 --> 31:23.275
He conned her into taking the fall...

31:23.275 --> 31:25.057
She wrote the note confessing to the murders

31:25.057 --> 31:27.205
and then backed it up with a suicide attempt.

31:27.205 --> 31:30.551
That's an almost insurmountable
obstacle to convicting anyone else.

31:30.551 --> 31:32.778
Is a search warrant asking for too much?

31:32.778 --> 31:34.910
For Mr. Smith?
What's your probable cause?

31:34.910 --> 31:36.591
Hermann Hesse?

31:36.591 --> 31:40.051
All right, what about the other girls,
Tina and Carolyn?

31:40.051 --> 31:43.768
Their friend admitted to poisoning
the coffee that they served.

31:43.768 --> 31:46.822
I can get you those warrants.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.873
Home of Sam & Sharon Walker
Channel Island, New York
Wednesday, June, 4

31:48.873 --> 31:51.589
Is my daughter in trouble?

31:51.589 --> 31:53.876
I'm asking as a mother.

31:53.876 --> 31:57.876
Yes, I think she is.

32:10.538 --> 32:13.644
I found a fake I.D. Over at Carolyn's.

32:13.644 --> 32:17.202
They changed their birth dates
to make them 18.

32:17.702 --> 32:19.439
They're running away.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.769
The cops stop them with I.D.'s like this,

32:21.769 --> 32:23.162
they won't make them as runaways.

32:23.162 --> 32:25.919
So leave Claudia to take
the blame and hit the road?

32:25.919 --> 32:28.794
Doesn't sound like much of a plan.

32:28.794 --> 32:32.413
Well, Connie's probably got
the rest of the plan in his head.

32:32.413 --> 32:36.272
I doubt they'd go anywhere without him.

32:36.772 --> 32:39.488
Connie ever mention any travel plans to you?

32:39.488 --> 32:41.800
No, but we'll be moving soon.

32:41.800 --> 32:45.165
We lose our lease at the end of the year.

32:45.165 --> 32:48.005
You have any idea where you'll go?

32:48.005 --> 32:52.309
Well, there's no room for me
at the parish in the Bronx,

32:52.309 --> 32:55.085
and Connie will be 18 in a few months.

32:55.085 --> 32:57.112
It's very uncertain.

32:57.112 --> 32:58.625
Well, maybe he'll stay around here.

32:58.625 --> 33:01.139
I mean, after all, this is
where his girlfriends are.

33:01.139 --> 33:04.753
Girlfriends? I had no idea.

33:04.753 --> 33:08.238
- You're surprised?
- Well, Connie's shy.

33:08.238 --> 33:10.649
I mean, he likes girls, and they like him.

33:10.649 --> 33:12.592
They say he's a good listener.

33:12.592 --> 33:14.081
But some of them told Mrs. Hale

33:14.081 --> 33:18.081
that he never so much as tried to kiss them.

33:20.226 --> 33:21.987
Are these your bookmarks?

33:21.987 --> 33:24.777
That might be Connie.
He does that.

33:24.777 --> 33:27.337
Prophet of Blood.

33:27.337 --> 33:29.175
The Four Revelations.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.873
The Book of Mormon.

33:30.873 --> 33:33.652
He's only reading books about Mormonism.

33:33.652 --> 33:36.063
Is he thinking of converting?

33:36.063 --> 33:38.392
I don't think so.

33:38.392 --> 33:42.392
West to Utah: The Great Pilgrimage.

33:44.039 --> 33:47.536
Utah? He's taking the girls to Utah?

33:48.036 --> 33:51.472
It's the home of hundreds of fundamentalist sects.

33:51.472 --> 33:54.675
Breakaway groups, prophets.

33:54.675 --> 33:57.519
I mean, Connie and the girls
would hardly be noticed.

33:57.519 --> 34:01.091
It's like the Manson family
blending into the '60s California.

34:01.091 --> 34:03.424
Can we use the phony I.D.'s
and the sex parties...

34:03.424 --> 34:05.855
to have the girls declared persons
in need of supervision?

34:05.855 --> 34:08.780
Would holding them keep him here?

34:08.780 --> 34:12.271
Well, he needs his admirers.

34:12.271 --> 34:15.233
What's his hold on them? Sex?

34:15.233 --> 34:16.835
He offers the opposite.

34:16.835 --> 34:19.531
No sex, no pressure.

34:19.531 --> 34:22.233
They feel safe with him.

34:22.233 --> 34:24.721
The question is...

34:24.721 --> 34:28.324
is how far will they go to make him feel safe?

34:28.824 --> 34:32.230
Holding Room Family Court, Bronx
New York, Thursday, June 5

34:32.230 --> 34:35.476
It's about time. Where's that shrink?

34:35.476 --> 34:38.319
He won't be here for another hour.

34:38.319 --> 34:41.051
Hey, don't worry about it.
We can put the time to good use.

34:41.051 --> 34:43.344
I have a couple of questions for
your daughters about Connie Smith.

34:43.344 --> 34:45.768
Who's he? Is he another one of
those boys you think might have...

34:45.768 --> 34:48.415
Their relationship had
nothing to do with sex.

34:48.415 --> 34:52.415
Isn't that right?
It was on a higher level. Right, girls?

34:55.554 --> 34:59.555
Hey, I gotta tell ya.
Connie's in big trouble.

35:00.495 --> 35:04.270
Claudia, she took the rap
for the church poisonings,

35:04.270 --> 35:06.479
but he still has to account for the drownings.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.832
You don't think our girls
had anything to do with that?

35:08.832 --> 35:12.385
We think it was just Connie.
He was jealous of those boys.

35:12.385 --> 35:14.673
But we'd like to know
what he said to your daughters.

35:14.673 --> 35:16.658
He didn't say anything.

35:16.658 --> 35:17.932
He didn't do it.

35:17.932 --> 35:20.375
You know what? He's lucky,
because if it weren't for Claudia,

35:20.375 --> 35:23.032
he'd be facing the death penalty.

35:23.032 --> 35:26.888
She saved his life.

35:27.388 --> 35:29.121
You just take a good look at this girl,

35:29.121 --> 35:33.121
and you can see the depths
of her devotion to him.

35:34.957 --> 35:38.957
He has to know that
she's his one true friend.

35:40.182 --> 35:43.986
Probably the only friend he has left.

35:44.486 --> 35:46.730
Connie didn't make those guys drown.

35:46.730 --> 35:48.576
- I did.
- Tina, shut up.

35:48.576 --> 35:49.997
Hey, that's okay. We don't believe her.

35:49.997 --> 35:52.939
It's true. I told them to meet me
on Hart Island for a party.

35:52.939 --> 35:54.117
I messed with that boat.

35:54.117 --> 35:56.421
I put stuff in the cracks,
so it wouldn't sink right away.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.088
That's not gonna fly.

35:58.088 --> 36:00.026
- I can prove it.
- Not another word!

36:00.026 --> 36:02.297
I will not let you throw your life away
for some little freak!

36:02.297 --> 36:03.884
He's not a freak!

36:03.884 --> 36:06.606
He knows things!
More things than you do!

36:06.606 --> 36:09.830
He's special. He showed us
how we can be happy

36:09.830 --> 36:13.830
and control our life, and he never
asked us for anything.

36:15.493 --> 36:17.639
I can prove I did it.

36:17.639 --> 36:20.058
You go to my dad's tool shed.

36:20.058 --> 36:22.651
You'll see.

36:22.651 --> 36:25.349
I want to see this alleged
statement against my client.

36:25.349 --> 36:26.446
All in good time.

36:26.446 --> 36:28.960
I'm warning you, Mr. Carver.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.950
I won't put up with any tricks.

36:31.950 --> 36:33.419
How'd the booking go?

36:33.419 --> 36:36.464
He was a perfect young gentleman.

36:36.464 --> 36:38.368
That's what everyone says.

36:38.368 --> 36:40.843
Mr. Smith, we're here
to discuss a plea agreement...

36:40.843 --> 36:44.441
on three counts of murder by drowning.

36:44.441 --> 36:46.530
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Hold on.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.413
I want to see that statement.

36:48.413 --> 36:51.763
- What statement?
- One of the girls gave you up.

36:51.763 --> 36:53.769
There's nothing to give up.

36:53.769 --> 36:55.060
I didn't do anything.

36:55.060 --> 36:59.060
What you didn't do yourself,
you told them to do.

36:59.663 --> 37:03.663
I never told anyone to do anything.

37:04.639 --> 37:08.113
Which one do you think
gave you up...Tina or Carolyn?

37:08.113 --> 37:10.646
Neither of them would say
anything against me.

37:10.646 --> 37:14.272
Why? You're not allowed
to speak against the prophet?

37:14.772 --> 37:17.306
- I'm nobody's prophet.
- No, see, they think you are.

37:17.306 --> 37:19.329
They think you're teaching them to,

37:19.329 --> 37:21.440
well, control their world, you know.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.032
But the joke is on them, right?

37:25.032 --> 37:28.420
I can't teach anyone anything.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.805
No, you just listen.

37:30.805 --> 37:33.754
Is that right?

37:33.754 --> 37:38.059
All these kids, you know,
taking drugs, uh, drinking,

37:38.059 --> 37:40.107
having the sex parties,

37:40.107 --> 37:43.874
while you just wait with
your little fishing rod,

37:44.374 --> 37:48.203
and you hook whatever damaged
goods comes out of the pit.

37:48.703 --> 37:51.527
Their parents made them what they are.
I didn't do anything.

37:51.527 --> 37:53.480
And when those girls wanted to hurt

37:53.480 --> 37:56.914
those mean boys who debased them,

38:00.020 --> 38:01.801
- then you did something.
- No.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.733
You exploited their anger.

38:03.733 --> 38:07.374
And after you helped them kill,
you exploited their fear.

38:07.874 --> 38:10.223
Mr. Carver, if I don't see that statement,

38:10.223 --> 38:12.129
- we're not continuing.
- You walk out that door,

38:12.129 --> 38:14.796
- any chance of a plea bargain goes with you.
- Come on.

38:14.796 --> 38:19.281
Just tell me which one, Connie.
Tina or Carolyn?

38:19.281 --> 38:22.607
Look, I don't kill for myself.

38:22.607 --> 38:25.387
And for sure I wouldn't kill for them.

38:25.387 --> 38:28.088
There's nothing in it for me.

38:28.088 --> 38:32.273
There's admiration,
because special people like admirers,

38:32.273 --> 38:35.897
and... and you're special.

38:36.397 --> 38:40.397
- Well, aren't you, Connie?
- I'm not...

38:41.101 --> 38:44.022
I'm not that special.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.906
Well, I think you made yourself special.

38:46.906 --> 38:50.864
I think that's the lie you told yourself
to explain why your mother ditched you.

38:51.364 --> 38:54.592
No. That's not reality.

38:54.592 --> 38:56.820
My mother has important work.

38:56.820 --> 39:00.820
Like cleaning motel rooms in Laughlin?

39:01.476 --> 39:04.999
Well, here's her number,
if you want to call her.

39:04.999 --> 39:09.831
Oh, look, look!
Bing! Reality!

39:14.066 --> 39:18.066
People leave you.
Your mother, soon your uncle.

39:19.028 --> 39:23.028
I don't let that stuff bother me.

39:23.541 --> 39:25.113
Oh.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.791
I've got myself.

39:26.791 --> 39:30.567
The rest of the world can just fade away.

39:30.567 --> 39:32.107
I don't care.

39:32.107 --> 39:34.438
'Cause you're all alone,
like a star in the heavens,

39:34.438 --> 39:38.438
overcome by an icy despair,
but more firmly yourself than ever.

39:39.848 --> 39:42.038
Isn't that what you're tryin' to tell me?

39:42.038 --> 39:44.268
You see, unlike the girls,

39:44.268 --> 39:47.924
you know, I've read the book,
so don't try and con me.

39:48.424 --> 39:52.424
The reason you only have yourself is
'cause you have no choice.

39:54.158 --> 39:58.158
And you don't trust anyone.

39:59.628 --> 40:02.488
And this is why.

40:02.488 --> 40:05.046
There's nothing on that piece of paper.

40:05.046 --> 40:06.218
I know who I can trust.

40:06.218 --> 40:08.877
Come on! You were bringing
the two girls to Utah, right?

40:08.877 --> 40:11.688
'Cause if one of'em betrays you,
then you still have the other one.

40:11.688 --> 40:13.328
Those things don't happen to me.

40:13.328 --> 40:16.355
No? Well, they happen to every prophet.

40:16.355 --> 40:19.133
And if you learned anything
from reading these books,

40:19.133 --> 40:22.721
you should've learned that.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.572
No one betrays me.

40:25.572 --> 40:28.901
Come on. Tina or Carolyn?

40:28.901 --> 40:29.971
No one betrays me.

40:29.971 --> 40:31.914
Think again!

40:31.914 --> 40:33.305
We got the smoking gun.

40:33.305 --> 40:37.305
The smoking... caulking gun.

40:39.106 --> 40:40.927
The one used to patch up the boat.

40:40.927 --> 40:44.544
The one that still has traces of
cake frosting and glue on it.

40:45.044 --> 40:46.805
You ready to answer that question now?

40:46.805 --> 40:49.259
It can't be.
I told her to clean it off.

40:49.259 --> 40:53.259
Come on.! Answer.!
Tina or Carolyn?

40:56.411 --> 41:00.411
- What'd you do to her?
- Answer!

41:01.539 --> 41:04.724
It's... It's...

41:04.724 --> 41:08.430
Tina.

41:08.930 --> 41:10.907
Tina! All right?

41:10.907 --> 41:12.872
It's Tina!

41:12.872 --> 41:14.530
She was mine!

41:14.530 --> 41:15.823
What did you do to her?

41:15.823 --> 41:18.663
Well, it's like the book says:

41:18.663 --> 41:22.663
That every sin carries grace within it.

41:27.768 --> 41:28.940
Ouch.

41:28.940 --> 41:32.292
You took her from me.
You took her from me.

41:32.292 --> 41:35.723
I should take this thing and beat
your brains in with it...

41:35.723 --> 41:37.729
'cause that's what you deserve,

41:37.729 --> 41:39.938
what you all deserve!

41:39.938 --> 41:42.637
There's more just like her,

41:42.637 --> 41:45.620
ready to crawl out of that pit...

41:45.620 --> 41:47.686
and come at you with knives...

41:47.686 --> 41:49.817
'cause that's what you deserve.

41:49.817 --> 41:53.238
That's what you deserve.
That's what you deserve!

41:53.238 --> 41:56.644
Get off me.! Get off!

41:57.144 --> 41:59.136
Arraignment Court
Part 22
Friday, June 6

41:59.136 --> 42:00.705
The defendant is remanded

42:00.705 --> 42:03.321
to the custody of
the Department of Correction,

42:03.321 --> 42:06.222
pending completion of a sentencing report.

42:06.222 --> 42:07.430
Next case.

42:07.430 --> 42:09.867
People v. Christina Walker and Carolyn James.

42:09.867 --> 42:13.316
Murder in the second degree, six counts.

42:13.316 --> 42:15.221
Connie! Connie! You'll be okay!

42:15.221 --> 42:16.595
You be quiet, young ladies.!

42:16.595 --> 42:17.888
We told them what happened.

42:17.888 --> 42:19.198
We told them we did it.

42:19.198 --> 42:23.198
Me and Carolyn,
we killed those pigs.

42:24.264 --> 42:26.697
We love you, Connie.

42:26.697 --> 42:30.697
Bailiff, will you take these people out
and bring in the next case?

42:34.961 --> 42:36.478
We're the only reality.

42:36.478 --> 42:40.478
The reality's inside us, right, Connie?

42:57.274 --> 42:59.016
He didn't look too happy.

42:59.016 --> 43:03.016
Reality caught up with him.

43:06.882 --> 43:10.599
Reality catches up with everybody.
