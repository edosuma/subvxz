<i>Hey, Chicago,</i>

01:16.701 --> 01:18.733
<i>what a day for a daydream.</i>

01:18.767 --> 01:22.101
<i>Show me an unhappy man today,
and I'll show you a--</i>

01:32.067 --> 01:34.133
A shoe salesman, Jim.

01:34.167 --> 01:37.066
Twentieth-century blacksmith,
a working man,

01:37.100 --> 01:38.800
an idiot.

01:38.834 --> 01:41.767
I'll feel better after
I have a nice cup of coffee.

02:03.934 --> 02:06.567
Life is good.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.300
Hi, honey.

02:09.334 --> 02:11.032
Heh-heh.
Did you miss me?

02:11.067 --> 02:13.334
With every bullet so far.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.500
Well,

02:16.534 --> 02:19.266
maybe you need
a bigger gun, sweetheart.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.633
Not that I don't love
your itty-bitty one.

02:23.734 --> 02:26.033
What got you up
before noon, Peg?

02:26.067 --> 02:28.733
Oh, a foul, evil wind.

02:28.767 --> 02:32.867
You were snoring through
your nose, mouth and ears.

02:32.901 --> 02:35.733
But I forgive you
because today is the day

02:35.767 --> 02:39.633
<i>the new fall preview issue
of TV Guide comes out.</i>

02:39.667 --> 02:42.567
Oh, look at it, Al.
It's still warm.

02:42.601 --> 02:43.567
Mm-hm.

02:43.601 --> 02:45.733
Well, pass it over
my coffee.

02:45.767 --> 02:48.066
Are you so jaded
that even the new TV season

02:48.100 --> 02:49.667
doesn't get you going?

02:49.701 --> 02:51.533
I mean, look
at these new shows.

02:51.567 --> 02:53.700
<i>"Everything's
Comin' up Maggie.</i>

02:53.734 --> 02:55.900
High jinks ensue
when Maggie-- "

02:55.934 --> 02:57.468
Chastity Bono.

02:58.734 --> 03:00.500
"-- accidentally
becomes vice president

03:00.534 --> 03:01.966
of the United States."

03:02.000 --> 03:03.633
Saturdays.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.366
Ooh, and look.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.133
<i>"We Are Family.</i>

03:07.167 --> 03:10.567
A Chinese family
with three children."

03:11.601 --> 03:14.600
Oh. I get it.

03:14.634 --> 03:17.101
<i>We Are Fami-Lee.</i>

03:19.701 --> 03:22.066
Ah, Jesus.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.633
It's here!
It's here!

03:27.667 --> 03:29.133
My high school diploma.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.834
I couldn't wait
for the mailman to come,

03:30.868 --> 03:33.500
so I just took it
out of his truck.

03:33.534 --> 03:36.468
I am a high school graduate.

03:37.767 --> 03:38.800
Read it to me, Mom.

03:38.834 --> 03:41.900
What does it say?
What does it say?

03:41.934 --> 03:44.433
Oh, Al,
isn't this exciting?

03:44.467 --> 03:46.667
Oh, leave me alone.

03:51.734 --> 03:53.966
Good morning,
everybody.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.867
Any chicks call for me
this morning?

03:56.901 --> 03:57.966
Yeah, the, uh,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.667
Malaysian mail-order bride
company called.

04:01.701 --> 04:02.667
No takers.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.433
Apparently,
even poor, hungry women

04:04.467 --> 04:08.334
from the Third World
think they can do better.

04:09.701 --> 04:12.900
Yuck it up,
future welfare mother.

04:15.467 --> 04:17.600
The babes will be
calling aplenty soon.

04:17.634 --> 04:19.334
I'm a senior now.

04:20.968 --> 04:23.066
A mover.
A shaker.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.366
I'm the man.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.133
I've got the juice.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.400
Yup.

04:29.434 --> 04:30.533
When I was a freshman,

04:30.567 --> 04:33.033
they flushed my head
down the toilet.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.467
When I was a sophomore,

04:34.501 --> 04:36.966
they flushed my head
down the toilet.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.366
When I was a junior,
I was getting cool,

04:39.400 --> 04:42.101
so they let me
flush it myself.

04:43.701 --> 04:47.834
But now, I'm a senior
and ready to rule.

04:47.868 --> 04:51.066
This year, he's back.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.967
He's cool. He's dry.

04:58.868 --> 05:01.667
Until he goes to sleep.

05:03.534 --> 05:06.700
Oh, Al, our little man.
Heh-heh-heh.

05:06.734 --> 05:08.334
Go away.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.633
I'm home!

05:15.100 --> 05:17.834
Marcie,
you don't live here.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.233
I know.

05:19.267 --> 05:22.133
No one actually
lives here.

05:22.167 --> 05:25.334
I meant I'm back
from my two weeks' vacation.

05:28.701 --> 05:30.900
You didn't know
I was gone?

05:34.033 --> 05:37.266
So you didn't remember
to air out my house,

05:37.300 --> 05:41.101
or water the plants,
or feed the goldfish?

05:45.167 --> 05:47.934
Oh, well. At least
my life is back on track.

05:47.968 --> 05:50.033
I spent my two weeks off
at a seminar:

05:50.067 --> 05:52.066
"You Are What You Were."

05:52.100 --> 05:55.234
So you are a chicken.

05:57.367 --> 05:59.867
With a bad haircut.

06:00.901 --> 06:03.266
You know, that would have
bothered me before,

06:03.300 --> 06:04.567
when I was what I'm not.

06:04.601 --> 06:07.066
But now that I am
what I was,

06:07.100 --> 06:09.767
I was what I am.

06:09.801 --> 06:12.033
Stand back, she's getting ready
to eat spinach,

06:12.067 --> 06:14.867
and then her tattoo
will get all big.

06:14.901 --> 06:19.600
You moron, it's not
I yam what I yam.

06:19.634 --> 06:20.867
That's '80s.

06:20.901 --> 06:22.700
The point is, I'm confident

06:22.734 --> 06:23.700
and renewed.

06:23.734 --> 06:25.099
So confident,
in fact,

06:25.133 --> 06:28.966
that I stopped by my bank
and demanded my old job back.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.099
And after 20 minutes of frugging
on my boss' desk in my slip,

06:33.133 --> 06:36.366
while the other tellers
tossed quarters at me,

06:36.400 --> 06:38.934
I am once again
what I was:

06:38.968 --> 06:41.734
a dignified bank manager.

06:44.801 --> 06:46.533
Ah, gee, Al,
isn't this great?

06:46.567 --> 06:48.800
Everybody has the start
of a whole new life,

06:48.834 --> 06:51.734
except for you and the dog.

07:04.334 --> 07:07.999
Well, that all but throws
the dirt in my face.

07:08.033 --> 07:10.400
Everybody,
I have an announcement.

07:10.434 --> 07:12.099
Your happiness

07:12.133 --> 07:14.767
sickens me.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.467
Everybody but me
is looking at good times.

07:17.501 --> 07:18.900
But for me,
it's been one

07:18.934 --> 07:21.733
long continuous year
since I got married.

07:21.767 --> 07:24.099
Actually,
one long month.

07:24.133 --> 07:26.366
Helluary.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.467
But I'm not bold enough
to expect happiness.

07:28.501 --> 07:30.333
I know that wasn't meant
for me.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.767
But what I'd like one time
in my life

07:32.801 --> 07:34.834
is for something new
to happen to me.

07:34.868 --> 07:36.333
Something special.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.300
You're right, honey.

07:38.334 --> 07:39.999
You know what you need?

07:40.033 --> 07:42.468
A good night job.

07:45.834 --> 07:47.533
Is that all I am to you?

07:47.567 --> 07:49.533
An oxen to be worked
in the field

07:49.567 --> 07:51.567
until he drops dead?

07:52.067 --> 07:53.333
Well, gee, honey.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.834
What did you think
you were to us?

07:55.868 --> 07:58.133
Well, perhaps husband,

07:58.167 --> 07:59.767
perhaps father.

07:59.801 --> 08:01.467
Perhaps the man who's
about to run amuck

08:01.501 --> 08:04.700
with a meat cleaver
if he doesn't have any fun!

08:05.801 --> 08:08.266
Now, family,
I've just made a decision.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.767
We're going on a Labor Day
vacation.

08:10.801 --> 08:11.767
Oh, no way.
Aw.
Aw.

08:11.801 --> 08:14.001
Shut up.

08:15.434 --> 08:18.767
But, honey, what about
the new TV season?

08:18.801 --> 08:20.733
I do not want to miss
the special premiere

08:20.767 --> 08:23.333
<i>of Grandmaster
and the Gopher.</i>

08:23.367 --> 08:26.266
"It's an hour drama
with comic overtones

08:26.300 --> 08:28.934
"about a rapper who goes
to the center of the Earth

08:28.968 --> 08:32.133
and raps
with the mole people."

08:32.167 --> 08:35.866
Oh, and look.
Sally Struthers is the queen.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.433
Oh, Mom.

08:39.033 --> 08:41.299
I am talking
about vacation,

08:41.333 --> 08:43.500
litter of my loins.

08:44.634 --> 08:47.033
Now, I shall tell you
where we will holiday.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.667
We're gonna go where people
pretend they want to go

08:49.701 --> 08:52.166
when they can't afford
to go someplace good.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.500
We're gonna see America.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.800
We take no map,
we'll follow the sun.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.433
We'll stay in cheap motels

08:58.467 --> 09:01.767
and steal what we need
along the way.

09:01.801 --> 09:03.233
We go west,

09:03.267 --> 09:06.166
past the cheese factories,
where the air is fresh,

09:06.200 --> 09:07.733
sky is big,

09:07.767 --> 09:11.533
and a man can still kill
his dinner with his car.

09:11.567 --> 09:15.166
Guys, tomorrow,
we put the pedal to the metal,

09:15.200 --> 09:18.967
and we ride with the wind.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.867
Gee, Al, uh,
think you could slow down?

09:43.934 --> 09:47.366
My hair is just
whipping in the wind.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.300
He's not scaring you,
is he, kids?

09:50.334 --> 09:51.567
Sorry, Mom.

09:51.601 --> 09:55.500
I couldn't hear you
over the roar of the engine.

09:55.534 --> 09:57.500
Come on, leave Daddy alone.

09:57.534 --> 09:58.966
I mean, how could
he possibly know

09:59.000 --> 10:03.234
that there would be
a traffic jam on Labor Day?

10:03.801 --> 10:05.567
Shut up.

10:06.501 --> 10:09.834
Al, we have not moved
an inch in two hours.

10:09.868 --> 10:12.567
Peg, I can hear
that in our bedroom.

10:14.868 --> 10:18.500
Now, just shut up
and let me enjoy myself.

10:18.534 --> 10:22.034
I could hear that
in our bedroom too, honey.

10:24.934 --> 10:28.066
Ah, I'm not gonna let you
ruin this for me, Peg.

10:28.100 --> 10:32.201
Yep, this is my vacation,
and I'm havin' fun.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.934
I'm lovin' this.

10:37.834 --> 10:40.099
Move! Move!

10:40.133 --> 10:42.133
I can't take anymore.

10:42.167 --> 10:44.066
Oh, God, you're killing me.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.368
Move! Move!

10:57.934 --> 10:59.700
Daddy?

11:00.501 --> 11:02.300
What?

11:02.334 --> 11:04.800
Are we there yet?

11:06.734 --> 11:08.066
If you don't shut up,

11:08.100 --> 11:11.366
I'm gonna put the car
in park and just sit here.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.200
Oooh!

11:14.234 --> 11:17.401
Peg, could you control them?
I'm trying to drive.

11:18.033 --> 11:20.700
Will we be back
by next Thursday, honey?

11:20.734 --> 11:21.767
Look.

11:21.801 --> 11:22.900
<i>"Nun of This.</i>

11:22.934 --> 11:25.334
"About a nun
who's had enough.

11:27.434 --> 11:29.900
"Karen Valentine
is Sister Lash.

11:29.934 --> 11:32.600
a nun with a gun."

11:32.634 --> 11:34.700
Enough, woman!

11:34.734 --> 11:37.233
Now, I know what'll take
our minds off this.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.099
How 'bout
a family sing-along?

11:39.133 --> 11:40.300
Well, I don't know, honey.

11:40.334 --> 11:41.567
You sure you can sing

11:41.601 --> 11:43.900
and pay attention to the road
at the same time?

11:43.934 --> 11:46.966
Don't make me
pull over, Peg.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.433
Okay. With me.

11:49.467 --> 11:52.033
* Oh, the cow kicked Nellie
In the belly in the barn *

11:52.067 --> 11:54.200
* Oh, the cow kicked Nellie
In the belly in the barn *

11:54.234 --> 11:56.200
* The cow kicked Nellie
In the belly in the barn *

11:56.234 --> 11:58.366
* And the farmer said
It would do no harm *

11:58.400 --> 12:00.300
* Second verse
Same as the first *

12:00.334 --> 12:02.166
* A little bit louder
But a little bit worse *

12:02.200 --> 12:03.600
Everybody.

12:03.634 --> 12:06.133
* Oh, the cow kicked Nellie
In the belly in the barn-- *

12:06.167 --> 12:07.200
Hey!

12:07.234 --> 12:09.767
Would you shut
the hell up!

12:12.033 --> 12:13.934
Are you talking
to me?

12:13.968 --> 12:16.433
No. I'm yelling
at you.

12:16.467 --> 12:18.368
Shut the hell up!

12:19.200 --> 12:20.800
* Oh *

12:20.834 --> 12:23.066
* The cow kicked Nellie
In the belly in the barn *

12:23.100 --> 12:24.667
* The cow kicked Nellie
In the belly *

12:24.701 --> 12:26.734
* In the barn *
Hey, I said...

12:27.834 --> 12:29.667
shut up!

12:30.300 --> 12:32.999
And if I don't?

12:33.033 --> 12:36.234
Then you'll be gummin'
"The Cow Kicked Nellie."

12:37.701 --> 12:40.301
Take the wheel, Peg.

12:42.534 --> 12:43.633
Now, look, pal,

12:43.667 --> 12:45.934
if you want trouble
with me, you--

12:46.501 --> 12:47.500
Honey!

12:47.534 --> 12:50.099
Al!

12:50.133 --> 12:52.733
Honey, we are in the middle
of the expressway.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.800
Yes, Gerry, don't you have
anything better to do

12:54.834 --> 12:57.633
than to pick a fight
with a moron?

12:59.567 --> 13:01.800
Just who are you
calling moron?

13:01.834 --> 13:04.600
Your husband,
you painted huss--

13:05.934 --> 13:06.934
Fight!

13:06.968 --> 13:09.167
Whoo! Yeah!

13:24.434 --> 13:25.700
Gerry!

13:25.734 --> 13:28.101
Gerry! Gerry!

13:31.133 --> 13:32.133
Al!

13:32.167 --> 13:34.234
We're moving!

13:35.400 --> 13:38.101
Come on, honey.
Let's go.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.134
Here we go.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.934
Is that it?

13:54.968 --> 13:57.033
Yeah.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.600
Let's go.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.200
Honey, I'm just gonna
reason with him.

14:01.234 --> 14:04.234
After all, we're human beings,
right? We're not animals--

14:23.734 --> 14:25.633
Oh, please.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.834
What's wrong
with you people?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.700
All right, so I made
a teeny little mistake

14:29.734 --> 14:31.999
actually leaving
on Labor Day, but it's done.

14:32.033 --> 14:34.567
We're in hell,
let's enjoy it.

14:34.601 --> 14:37.300
It's our vacation,
for God's sake.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.266
Just look around.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.234
Tell me what you see.

14:42.834 --> 14:45.567
I can see our house.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.500
Great, Dad.

14:48.534 --> 14:51.700
Five hours on the road
and we're almost home.

14:51.734 --> 14:53.200
Dope.
Idiot.

14:53.234 --> 14:54.233
Buffoon.

14:54.267 --> 14:55.700
I- I got another idea.

14:55.734 --> 14:58.633
Oh, put up the top,
so we don't get a windburn?

14:58.667 --> 15:00.667
That's it! I'm flooring it
right into this bus!

15:00.701 --> 15:01.733
Dad, no!
No, Dad!

15:01.767 --> 15:02.900
No, no, no, Al!

15:02.934 --> 15:04.633
Honey, no, no, it's okay.
We love you.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.066
What's your idea,
sweetie?

15:06.100 --> 15:08.400
We love you, Daddy.

15:08.434 --> 15:11.567
Well, uh, I was gonna say,
let's play geography.

15:11.601 --> 15:13.400
You know, I'll name
a state or a country,

15:13.434 --> 15:14.966
and the next person
names one

15:15.000 --> 15:17.300
that begins with the letter
the last one ended with.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.767
Sound good?

15:18.801 --> 15:19.999
Sounds great.

15:20.033 --> 15:21.700
Oh, man,
let's play.

15:21.734 --> 15:22.867
You start, Daddy.

15:22.901 --> 15:24.700
Okay.

15:24.734 --> 15:26.700
Alaska.

15:26.734 --> 15:28.733
A.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.301
Peg?

15:30.734 --> 15:32.300
Asia.

15:32.334 --> 15:34.266
Bud? A.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.266
Africa.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.800
Kel? A.

15:41.601 --> 15:44.434
Honey,
she's really trying.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.900
I know. I know.

15:48.934 --> 15:50.467
Hey, we need
some music.

15:50.501 --> 15:51.800
That'll get us
out of this.

15:51.834 --> 15:54.600
How 'bout some good old
American road music?

16:13.467 --> 16:14.834
Al?

16:14.868 --> 16:16.633
What?

16:17.534 --> 16:19.934
Honey, I have to go
to the bathroom.

16:19.968 --> 16:21.200
But don't you worry
about it.

16:21.234 --> 16:22.900
I-- I'm just gonna run
back to the house,

16:22.934 --> 16:24.434
and I'll be right back.

16:31.501 --> 16:34.099
Alabammer.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.600
Daddy. R.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.033
Hello.
Heh-heh-heh.

16:51.067 --> 16:52.567
Hi.

16:52.601 --> 16:54.633
Oh.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.301
Boy, that takes me back.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.500
Oh, hello, everybody.

17:08.534 --> 17:10.333
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

17:10.367 --> 17:13.599
But I, uh--
I took a nap and ate and--

17:13.634 --> 17:16.999
<i>Oh, watched the premiere
of All-Night Security Dude.</i>

17:17.032 --> 17:19.500
You know, I think it's
the part that Erik Estrada

17:19.534 --> 17:21.500
was born to play.

17:21.534 --> 17:23.532
Did I miss anything?

17:23.567 --> 17:25.599
Yes, Peg, you did.

17:25.634 --> 17:28.667
Kids, show Mommy
what she missed.

17:28.701 --> 17:30.800
This sucks, Daddy!
You'll rot in a lowly grave!

17:30.834 --> 17:32.934
Why don't you take us home?
You're not my father!

17:32.968 --> 17:35.234
We wanna go home!
We wanna go home!

17:36.634 --> 17:40.099
About four hours of that, Peg,
that's what you missed.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.867
And you couldn't
wait for me, huh?

17:42.901 --> 17:43.900
All right, look.

17:43.934 --> 17:45.733
It's almost 9:00.

17:45.767 --> 17:48.133
Traffic always thins out
about now.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.900
So everybody buckle
your seat belts up,

17:50.934 --> 17:53.300
'cause any minute now,

17:53.334 --> 17:55.767
we ride.

18:02.734 --> 18:05.134
Okay, kids,
rise and shine.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.200
Where are we?

18:08.234 --> 18:11.134
No sense in starting the day
with stupid questions.

18:13.701 --> 18:16.101
Al, we haven't moved.

18:18.067 --> 18:19.900
That's it. Come on, kids.
We're going home.

18:19.934 --> 18:21.467
Now, wait a second.
Where you going?

18:21.501 --> 18:23.567
You'll miss
all the fun.

18:23.601 --> 18:26.201
Al, you reek.

18:28.267 --> 18:29.800
I reek?

18:29.834 --> 18:31.400
I?

18:31.434 --> 18:32.667
I,

18:32.701 --> 18:35.333
who only wanted to share
in the joy and brotherhood

18:35.367 --> 18:38.099
of a family outing,
reek?

18:38.133 --> 18:40.733
Well, let me tell you
what reeks,

18:40.767 --> 18:42.834
okay?

18:48.634 --> 18:50.600
Now, what reeks

18:50.634 --> 18:55.233
is this facade
that we call Labor Day.

18:55.267 --> 18:57.667
Honk if you hate Labor Day!

19:00.567 --> 19:01.900
You know what else reeks?

19:01.934 --> 19:03.500
Families reek.

19:03.534 --> 19:06.201
Honk if you hate families!

19:09.133 --> 19:13.467
Because they are truly
the reason Labor Day reeks.

19:13.501 --> 19:14.999
Once a year,

19:15.033 --> 19:17.366
they're on
these highways and byways.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.567
And what do they say?

19:18.601 --> 19:21.166
"We hate this."
"We hate you."

19:21.200 --> 19:23.200
"Idiot."
"Moron."

19:23.234 --> 19:25.366
"Buffoon," Daddy.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.733
"Buffoon, Daddy."

19:26.767 --> 19:28.667
But what about us?

19:28.701 --> 19:30.333
The ones who truly labor?

19:30.367 --> 19:32.300
We're on
this stinking road every day,

19:32.334 --> 19:33.700
choking and wheezing,

19:33.734 --> 19:37.200
marching along like lemmings
to a horrible, screaming death.

19:37.234 --> 19:41.234
Who cries for us, Argentina?

19:41.868 --> 19:43.133
Not our families.

19:43.167 --> 19:44.934
Well, we can't expect that.

19:44.968 --> 19:48.133
The yoke on the oxen
feels no guilt.

19:48.167 --> 19:50.667
But what we can expect

19:50.701 --> 19:53.633
is that on our one
lousy, stinkin' day off,

19:53.667 --> 19:54.867
traffic can move us

19:54.901 --> 19:58.133
to our lousy, stinkin',
pathetic destinations.

19:58.167 --> 20:00.934
To our polluted beaches,

20:00.968 --> 20:02.500
our burning forests,

20:02.534 --> 20:04.300
our wheezing grandmas,

20:04.334 --> 20:05.667
to our family barbecues

20:05.701 --> 20:08.733
with Uncle Otto
and his runny eye.

20:08.767 --> 20:11.600
But does the highway department
prepare for us?

20:11.634 --> 20:13.767
Are they out here
helping us?

20:13.801 --> 20:15.667
Are they out there
in front of us,

20:15.701 --> 20:18.800
by that first damn car
that caused this traffic jam,

20:18.834 --> 20:21.533
saying,
"Step on the gas, you moron!

20:21.567 --> 20:23.600
Let the 20 million
people pass!"

20:23.634 --> 20:25.233
They are not.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.233
Why?

20:27.267 --> 20:30.066
Because they don't care.

20:30.100 --> 20:35.468
And that, my friends,
is what really reeks.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.800
So let's face it.
We're not moving.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.999
We're just lining up to die.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.600
But let's show them

20:50.634 --> 20:53.500
that the American spirit
is not dead.

20:53.534 --> 20:55.500
So join me, will you,

20:55.534 --> 20:58.567
on this, our Labor Day,

20:58.601 --> 21:00.700
and get out of your cars

21:00.734 --> 21:04.101
and tear this highway to bits!

21:05.067 --> 21:06.900
Go into your trunks!

21:06.934 --> 21:08.166
Get your tire irons

21:08.200 --> 21:09.567
and your road flares!

21:09.601 --> 21:11.500
Burn, baby, burn!

21:11.534 --> 21:14.600
Vengeance is ours!

21:19.901 --> 21:21.700
Al! We're moving!

21:21.734 --> 21:23.366
Huh?

21:23.400 --> 21:24.867
Uh, we are...moving.

21:24.901 --> 21:26.300
Everyone!

21:26.334 --> 21:28.366
We are moving.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.366
In your cars.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.066
In your cars.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.834
Kids, let's go.
Let's go.

21:32.868 --> 21:34.467
See? I told you
to stick with me.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.600
Now, buckle up.

21:35.634 --> 21:37.834
Now,

21:38.501 --> 21:41.134
we ride.

21:43.367 --> 21:45.134
Flat tire.
Everyone out.

21:46.567 --> 21:48.200
I'll see you
next Tuesday, Al.

21:48.234 --> 21:49.700
Come on, kids,
we can still catch

21:49.734 --> 21:52.800
<i>Mark Spitz and Greg Louganis
in Swim Gyms.</i>

21:54.033 --> 21:55.800
It's a story
about synchronized swimmers

21:55.834 --> 21:58.966
that solve crimes
in their spare time.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.867
Fine. Go.
I don't need ya.

22:00.901 --> 22:03.034
I got my people.

22:04.901 --> 22:06.900
People.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.500
I've got a flat tire.

22:09.534 --> 22:10.767
Who will help me?

22:10.801 --> 22:13.934
Move that car!

22:15.868 --> 22:17.099
Now-- Now, there's no--

22:17.133 --> 22:18.999
There's no reason
to throw things.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.600
Now, get--
Get back in your cars.

22:20.634 --> 22:21.600
Stay calm!

22:21.634 --> 22:23.934
All right,
let's get him!
