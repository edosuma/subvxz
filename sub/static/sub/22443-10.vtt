"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,

01:16.340 --> 01:18.878
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;

01:19.953 --> 01:23.300
Conspiring with him how to load and bless

01:23.875 --> 01:27.380
the vines that round the thatch-eves run;"

01:28.141 --> 01:30.032
It's a poem by John Keats.

01:30.281 --> 01:31.561
About autumn.

01:32.045 --> 01:33.642
Life, and death,

01:33.939 --> 01:35.995
leaves and cider.

01:37.980 --> 01:38.820
That's autumn?

01:38.862 --> 01:40.209
Leaves and cider?

01:41.620 --> 01:43.364
That's what my teacher says.

01:43.980 --> 01:45.968
What do you think happens when things die?

01:46.632 --> 01:50.082
They're carried up to
Heaven, on a big fluffy cloud,

01:50.083 --> 01:52.080
where an old man with a long white beard

01:52.102 --> 01:54.197
meets them and gives them

01:55.174 --> 01:56.815
chocolate and,

01:56.820 --> 01:58.788
computer games and,

01:58.797 --> 02:00.419
pretty girls.

02:01.669 --> 02:03.305
You know I'm an atheist, right?

02:04.721 --> 02:06.967
But you're not dumb, you think about stuff.

02:06.992 --> 02:08.501
Yeah, I think about stuff.

02:08.502 --> 02:09.651
Me too.

02:09.652 --> 02:10.883
I'm like you.

02:12.843 --> 02:14.870
I want you to be better than me.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.081
Are you and Mom really
splitting up for good?

02:21.238 --> 02:23.540
I remember when your questions were about

02:23.660 --> 02:26.855
superheroes and Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:27.393 --> 02:28.999
I liked you better back then.

02:30.488 --> 02:32.119
Come on. I got a meeting.

02:32.139 --> 02:34.740
I have to dump you like
the bad parent I am.

02:50.693 --> 02:51.626
Come in.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.592
If I can just ask,

03:17.169 --> 03:19.020
what the fuck were you thinking?

03:19.206 --> 03:21.040
- Both of you.
- It was a mistake.

03:21.041 --> 03:23.034
- Neither of us intended for...
- You don't have to explain yourself.

03:23.864 --> 03:25.823
How dare you ask that question?

03:26.461 --> 03:28.216
You're not exactly Mother Theresa.

03:29.212 --> 03:30.643
And for what it's worth,

03:31.771 --> 03:33.037
I don't regret it.

03:34.634 --> 03:36.118
OK, look, Sonny,

03:36.138 --> 03:37.745
Nelson looked at me straight in the eye

03:37.765 --> 03:40.480
and said that if Victor ever
touches another dead woman,

03:40.841 --> 03:41.891
he will kill him.

03:41.906 --> 03:43.518
Victor only did it one time.

03:43.638 --> 03:44.607
Years ago,

03:44.727 --> 03:46.140
when his wife passed.

03:46.365 --> 03:47.650
It was grief.

03:47.660 --> 03:50.072
Well, actually, his wife
didn't pass. He killed her.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.709
He did it more than one time, Sonny.

03:54.229 --> 03:55.933
Has he had any girlfriends?

03:56.314 --> 03:57.730
Since his wife?

03:58.995 --> 04:01.232
- Uh, yeah, I think so.
- Have you met them?

04:01.476 --> 04:02.443
No.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.929
But he talks about them.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.941
Well, we know of at least
two occasions, recently.

04:10.659 --> 04:11.827
I'm sorry.

04:14.576 --> 04:15.983
Nelson will kill him.

04:16.398 --> 04:17.785
That's the idea.

04:18.238 --> 04:19.533
We need your help.

04:20.690 --> 04:21.579
No.

04:21.700 --> 04:22.791
We only need your apartment.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.700
- No, I'm not part of what you people do!
- You don't have to do anything.

04:24.710 --> 04:25.897
Yes, you are.

04:27.618 --> 04:29.698
How many other places
like this do you have?

04:31.278 --> 04:33.108
Show yourselves out.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.889
Take your bottle with you.

04:36.947 --> 04:38.570
Nelson is a thorough man.

04:38.613 --> 04:39.670
If he has good reasons,

04:39.675 --> 04:41.798
he'll have this place
swept for prints and DNA.

04:42.923 --> 04:43.980
So what now?

04:44.037 --> 04:47.220
We still need to find a location
that Victor has access to.

04:47.340 --> 04:48.619
That was the perfect place.

04:49.339 --> 04:50.829
You want to set him up on a date

04:50.843 --> 04:52.990
with an attractive recently dead girl,

04:53.576 --> 04:55.854
hide in the wardrobe to get pictures?

04:56.079 --> 04:58.596
No, Victor can't know about it.

04:59.068 --> 05:00.532
He can't know.

05:00.652 --> 05:03.788
We could put a supermodel
on a platter for him,

05:04.219 --> 05:05.989
but what if he doesn't take the bait?

05:06.109 --> 05:07.851
What if she's not his type?

05:08.278 --> 05:11.228
Necrophiliacs have a type?
More than just, you know...

05:11.348 --> 05:13.097
- Dead?
- I don't know.

05:13.217 --> 05:14.898
Do you wanna take the chance?

05:18.043 --> 05:19.815
So we have to kill a girl?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.202
No, we're not gonna kill anyone!

05:23.793 --> 05:25.234
What are you thinking?

05:25.535 --> 05:27.096
Fabricated.

05:27.133 --> 05:28.627
Setted up.

05:29.392 --> 05:31.620
Making him responsible for it.

05:33.483 --> 05:35.367
There's just one problem.

05:36.305 --> 05:39.293
We need to get hold of
some of Victor's sperm.

05:39.953 --> 05:41.049
What?

05:41.087 --> 05:42.513
You heard her.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.352
Nelson is a thorough man.

05:44.359 --> 05:46.596
He'll run a DNA test.

05:47.211 --> 05:50.049
And we still need a
location, that's two problems.

05:51.527 --> 05:53.180
And a dead girl.

05:54.672 --> 05:56.279
Three problems.

05:57.585 --> 05:59.528
I can't bear the thought of it.

06:00.999 --> 06:02.966
On top of everything, Mom will wear that...

06:03.273 --> 06:05.980
that fake smile that
doesn't reach the eyes.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.865
It'll take every ounce of
strength for her not to beat

06:08.880 --> 06:12.300
"I told you so", the
moment you walk in the door.

06:12.341 --> 06:14.773
"Marrying a dirty little French man!"

06:15.006 --> 06:17.288
Then maybe I should just tell
her he's involved with gangsters,

06:17.296 --> 06:21.180
- and murders, and drugs!
- Shut up! I'm still your fuckin' lawyer.

06:21.620 --> 06:23.758
Mom'll love having the kids to stay.

06:23.878 --> 06:26.165
So don't be too hard on her.

06:26.878 --> 06:29.515
- And you need to get out of London.
- I know.

06:31.572 --> 06:33.261
I just...

06:35.453 --> 06:38.019
You know, I can't seem to
get past the notion that he is

06:38.020 --> 06:40.406
fundamentally a good man who's just...

06:41.480 --> 06:44.550
- behaving like a cunt.
- A redeemable cunt?

06:45.928 --> 06:47.465
So, what next?

06:47.466 --> 06:51.332
Assuming there is no miracle marital cure?

06:55.301 --> 06:57.562
Life as a single parent.

06:58.322 --> 06:59.740
There.

06:59.860 --> 07:01.660
You said it out loud.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.100
It will get easier.

07:13.390 --> 07:16.476
- So how do you know this guy?
- He used to be a doctor.

07:16.495 --> 07:18.569
We'd see him at scenes.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.515
He developed some painkillers addiction.

07:21.635 --> 07:24.133
- They stuck him down here.
- Like Quasimodo.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.741
Except down, not up.

07:27.229 --> 07:28.673
Come on.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.710
_

07:37.164 --> 07:39.763
We would need the body
for 24 hours at most.

07:39.791 --> 07:43.178
She would be returned to you
untouched, in perfect condition.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.145
No one would ever have to know.

07:45.540 --> 07:46.580
Still dead.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.424
Thanks for clarifying that.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.832
I need to know more about your plans.

07:51.869 --> 07:53.979
I'm afraid we can't do that.

07:57.318 --> 07:59.500
I take it you've got another one of those.

08:11.444 --> 08:13.103
It's too risky.

08:13.111 --> 08:15.970
- You're a greedy little junkie, you know that?
- Calm down.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.948
- Double it.
- You know what?

08:21.154 --> 08:22.820
Fuck you.

08:25.292 --> 08:26.681
Let's go.

08:27.731 --> 08:29.620
OK, wait.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.179
Show me.

08:58.290 --> 08:59.893
Yeah, I don't think she's right for us.

08:59.894 --> 09:03.497
- That's all you've got?
- This is no fucking second-hand car you're buying!

09:03.966 --> 09:05.568
I've shown you everybody.

09:05.571 --> 09:09.859
Unless you wanna see the guys, the
RTA victims, or dismembered corpses.

09:09.860 --> 09:12.691
I don't think guys or people
with one leg do it for us either.

09:12.692 --> 09:14.646
How many dead bodies come
through here each day?

09:14.647 --> 09:16.113
If business is slow

09:16.259 --> 09:18.876
- six or seven.
- Business, huh?

09:19.205 --> 09:22.678
Well, we have stuff to prepare,
but, if something comes in,

09:22.791 --> 09:25.540
- we'd be very grateful.
- Attractive women in their twenties

09:25.541 --> 09:28.473
tend not to drop dead of
natural causes, you know.

09:29.060 --> 09:31.356
And if the family is sniffing around...

09:31.871 --> 09:33.832
All right, thanks. Come on.

09:37.454 --> 09:39.060
You just told a lie in there.

09:39.081 --> 09:42.436
"She'll be returned untouched and
in perfect condition." She won't.

09:42.556 --> 09:44.340
No, she won't.

09:44.358 --> 09:45.784
And it doesn't bother you?

09:45.904 --> 09:47.654
Yeah, it bothers me.

09:47.924 --> 09:50.176
Like I have acid in my gut.

09:50.784 --> 09:53.860
But right now, we have
to look after the living.

09:56.033 --> 09:58.500
I fucked a girl with one leg once.

09:59.007 --> 10:00.565
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:00.685 --> 10:03.246
- Well keep it to yourself.
- Anita.

10:03.568 --> 10:06.691
- She could run really fast.
- Keep it to yourself.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.620
Sorry.

10:28.122 --> 10:29.255
Hey.

10:30.569 --> 10:32.160
How are you bearing up?

10:32.400 --> 10:33.980
I'm fine, thank you.

10:39.824 --> 10:41.933
They hate me 'cause I left.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.433
'Cause...

10:43.621 --> 10:46.931
I was the baby. I was meant
to stay and look after Mom.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.746
And be what they expected.

10:50.211 --> 10:51.660
Who are "they"?

10:51.705 --> 10:53.904
Three brothers, one sister.

10:54.647 --> 10:57.161
an assortment of aunties and uncles.

10:58.512 --> 11:00.089
What did they expect?

11:01.162 --> 11:02.846
A good girl.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.785
Respectful woman.

11:07.772 --> 11:09.315
Contained life.

11:10.417 --> 11:11.755
So you got out.

11:12.243 --> 11:13.682
Fuck yeah.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.724
Why are you putting yourself through this?

11:20.265 --> 11:22.832
Because it's family, right?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.180
You know about this stuff.

11:27.913 --> 11:29.740
I haven't made...

11:30.142 --> 11:32.536
too many smart decisions lately.

11:34.578 --> 11:36.180
My mom...

11:37.898 --> 11:39.937
she was a remarkable woman.

11:42.548 --> 11:43.922
Hey.

11:54.497 --> 11:55.975
Nice run?

11:56.411 --> 11:58.620
Yes. Thank you.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.711
- It's just what I needed.
- We've made lunch.

12:01.917 --> 12:04.780
I wanted to make the sauce from scratch.

12:04.900 --> 12:06.664
She wouldn't let me.

12:06.936 --> 12:08.578
It's from a jar.

12:09.347 --> 12:12.311
OK, why are you being so
nice? It's freaking me out.

12:12.856 --> 12:14.554
Did Dad hurt you?

12:16.750 --> 12:18.926
- You're making us leave home.
He must have done something.

12:18.941 --> 12:22.700
I'm not making him leave home.
It's just... it's a few days away.

12:23.372 --> 12:26.409
- It is more for my sake than yours.
- You're full of shit, Mom.

12:27.894 --> 12:30.249
That's one of the reasons we love you.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.152
Not the only one.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.887
I'm starving.

12:46.528 --> 12:48.460
OK, what are we having?

13:03.791 --> 13:06.100
You've got nerve calling me.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.724
I've got a favour to ask.

13:08.437 --> 13:10.328
What I did with Sonny was wrong.

13:10.606 --> 13:13.526
Tomorrow, I'm gonna see your
brother and apologize in person.

13:14.749 --> 13:16.933
He'll kill you right where you stand.

13:17.143 --> 13:18.660
And I deserve it.

13:19.057 --> 13:20.740
I'm fine with that.

13:21.579 --> 13:24.798
But all I want to know is that
my brother will be protected.

13:25.108 --> 13:27.820
And you're the only one
who can guarantee that.

13:28.748 --> 13:30.700
You're taking the piss?

13:30.709 --> 13:32.655
No, man, we drank together.

13:32.700 --> 13:35.965
I told you shit I haven't
told anybody. I trust you.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.907
But most of all, I trust that
you're gonna be king one day.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.869
That's why I wanna talk face-to-face.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.820
Wine bar.

13:51.358 --> 13:54.740
Corner of Tolland Road and Campbell
Street, call it two o'clock.

13:54.766 --> 13:57.033
I've got business.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.091
Fucking hell!

14:29.361 --> 14:31.799
How many dead girls do
you think you've seen?

14:33.789 --> 14:35.155
Too many.

14:36.371 --> 14:38.878
You know they seem to die more than guys.

14:41.693 --> 14:43.757
I think they die about the same.

14:43.877 --> 14:45.634
Women always get the blame.

14:45.641 --> 14:47.248
Helen of Troy.

14:47.661 --> 14:50.048
Joan of Arc. Virgin Mary.

14:50.535 --> 14:52.179
Hillary Clinton.

14:52.779 --> 14:54.414
Always the woman.

14:56.798 --> 14:58.443
You blame Mom.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.130
- Oh shit.
- But Dad's death, it wasn't her.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.534
I'm responsible.

15:06.060 --> 15:07.192
You're drunk.

15:07.220 --> 15:09.179
The whole town knew

15:09.191 --> 15:11.130
- she was fucking that cop.
- I know this.

15:11.172 --> 15:13.039
No, you don't! It didn't happen

15:13.076 --> 15:14.547
the way you think it did.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.956
You see, when Capoue disappeared,

15:23.067 --> 15:26.172
everybody figured maybe Dad
had finally grown a pair.

15:30.117 --> 15:33.228
Good job. He deserved it.

15:35.546 --> 15:37.959
- He was humiliated.
- Why?

15:38.079 --> 15:39.900
He was suddenly a tough guy.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.418
He didn't like it,

15:41.466 --> 15:43.664
people talking, staring,

15:43.784 --> 15:45.345
asking questions.

15:47.260 --> 15:48.528
So I went to see him.

16:02.988 --> 16:04.766
What are you doing around here?

16:05.954 --> 16:07.197
I'm sorry.

16:11.755 --> 16:13.238
It's done, Dad.

16:13.832 --> 16:16.060
- What's done?
- The cop.

16:16.090 --> 16:17.171
It's done.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.312
Jean and I handled it.

16:22.341 --> 16:23.914
What are you talking about?

16:24.196 --> 16:26.148
What I'm telling you, Dad, is that...

16:26.424 --> 16:28.381
we put an axe in his head.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.251
He's dead.

16:32.621 --> 16:34.362
He's not gonna fuck Mom anymore.

16:53.260 --> 16:54.808
We made a vow.

16:58.332 --> 17:00.158
Never tell anyone.

17:01.443 --> 17:02.883
I stuck to it,

17:02.884 --> 17:05.406
all these years. Not even Julie.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.598
I didn't want to let him suffer.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.944
You're the guy that never
tells any lies, right?

17:11.380 --> 17:12.420
Except this.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.411
A tiny omission, don't you think?

17:15.180 --> 17:18.061
The most important thing
that ever fucking happened!

17:18.500 --> 17:20.960
- Actually, there's something else.
- No, fuck you!

17:21.373 --> 17:22.848
I don't wanna hear about it.

17:23.496 --> 17:24.529
Don't talk to me.

17:48.170 --> 17:50.145
You steam-rolled me, baby.

17:50.452 --> 17:52.060
Fair and square. I'm proud of you.

17:52.180 --> 17:54.238
I've been taking it easy
on you for two years, Dad,

17:54.243 --> 17:55.521
but not today.

17:55.881 --> 17:57.010
Why not today?

17:57.442 --> 17:59.268
We're leaving London because of you.

17:59.494 --> 18:01.190
- It's just for a couple weeks.
- I don't care what you've done,

18:01.205 --> 18:02.684
you need to fix things.

18:02.732 --> 18:04.100
Everybody's hurting.

18:04.154 --> 18:06.397
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.

18:13.948 --> 18:14.895
Hey.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.691
I hope you don't mind, I
dropped Maddy and she let me in.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.574
I'd rather you weren't here.

18:22.908 --> 18:25.580
After her game, Maddy
asked me to fix things.

18:26.495 --> 18:27.962
Well, that makes me sad.

18:30.157 --> 18:31.584
'Cause you don't want to fix it?

18:31.626 --> 18:32.826
Mm...

18:33.654 --> 18:36.691
'cause our thirteen year old is making
please on behalf of our marriage.

18:40.557 --> 18:42.378
I was lying to protect you.

18:44.221 --> 18:45.427
I don't believe you.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.840
- You don't believe I was in trouble?
- No, I believe you were in trouble.

18:49.219 --> 18:51.071
I just think you fucking loved it.

18:51.180 --> 18:52.620
- What?
- In your element.

18:52.623 --> 18:53.997
Pumped full of adrenaline,

18:54.117 --> 18:57.268
barely sleeping, always
thinking, pushing life hard.

18:57.283 --> 18:58.671
- That's not true.
- Yes!

18:58.700 --> 18:59.857
Yeah, it is.

19:01.722 --> 19:04.354
Do you know who you've reminded
me of these past few months?

19:07.251 --> 19:08.860
You, when we first met.

19:09.792 --> 19:13.751
When you just had your wits and
not this rampant fucking ego.

19:14.331 --> 19:16.353
- It's not ego.
- Do you love her?

19:18.153 --> 19:19.360
Claire ?

19:22.619 --> 19:23.823
No.

19:25.750 --> 19:26.955
You know,

19:27.330 --> 19:28.631
I wish you did.

19:29.498 --> 19:30.700
Ah...

19:30.780 --> 19:33.567
I really did wish you
cared for Claire, because...

19:34.485 --> 19:36.252
well, maybe then I could,

19:36.531 --> 19:38.534
understand this betrayal.

19:39.734 --> 19:43.030
But as it is, you're just some guy who
couldn't keep his dick in his pants.

19:54.712 --> 19:55.644
Hey.

19:58.460 --> 19:59.674
I need you to go.

20:45.632 --> 20:46.996
Your name's Victor.

20:50.724 --> 20:51.949
It suits you.

20:53.871 --> 20:56.273
Um, Michael seemed... seemed wrong.

21:00.179 --> 21:01.625
It's an unusual name.

21:03.740 --> 21:04.992
Old fashioned.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.452
My parents were patriots.

21:09.066 --> 21:10.266
Two boys,

21:11.304 --> 21:12.697
Nelson and Victor.

21:15.301 --> 21:17.405
Your brother said you
were brought up in care.

21:17.626 --> 21:19.413
Negligent patriots.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.279
That's the English way.

21:24.304 --> 21:26.860
The damage we do to our children, eh?

21:31.255 --> 21:32.542
Are you going somewhere?

21:34.210 --> 21:35.414
Yeah.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.784
Yeah, thought we'd take a little trip.

21:39.953 --> 21:41.159
Family?

21:41.179 --> 21:42.379
Mm-hm.

21:45.399 --> 21:47.638
You can't hide behind family anymore.

21:49.448 --> 21:51.182
It makes them a target.

21:51.721 --> 21:53.421
Your mom and dad, your kids.

21:54.578 --> 21:56.927
They'll find them just to get to Jean.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.423
He's done that to you.

22:03.180 --> 22:05.371
You know, you don't have to hurt us.

22:06.183 --> 22:07.841
I have to hurt him.

22:09.402 --> 22:11.794
'Cause he turned my brother against me.

22:14.456 --> 22:15.663
No.

22:17.975 --> 22:19.175
No!

22:19.461 --> 22:21.147
No, you do not...

22:21.161 --> 22:23.318
you do not threaten my family!

22:33.860 --> 22:35.821
Mom, are you in the garage?

22:39.871 --> 22:42.316
Just coming, darling, be out in a sec.

23:15.701 --> 23:17.080
I'll have the same as him.

23:17.081 --> 23:18.281
OK.

23:19.980 --> 23:22.518
- Still on the whiskey?
- Instant adrenaline, mate.

23:24.765 --> 23:26.216
Your friend's hanging out?

23:27.374 --> 23:29.161
He's got an urgent job on.

23:42.348 --> 23:44.245
Fucking Sonny...

23:46.892 --> 23:49.212
You are one crazy motherfucker.

23:51.859 --> 23:53.362
That makes two of us.

24:05.237 --> 24:06.438
What's this?

24:06.714 --> 24:10.017
This is being inside the
tent, and pissing out.

24:11.078 --> 24:12.278
Right.

24:12.934 --> 24:14.480
Due diligence

24:14.548 --> 24:15.898
on Buckingham Gate.

24:16.517 --> 24:18.862
One hundred kilos of paperwork.

24:21.311 --> 24:23.953
This is what makes real wealth unobtainable

24:23.986 --> 24:25.413
to the ordinary man.

24:25.827 --> 24:27.994
If you can't afford an army of lawyers,

24:28.244 --> 24:29.838
you're not invited to play.

24:30.559 --> 24:32.341
We're crashing the party.

24:33.902 --> 24:35.401
Hey, listen, you know,

24:35.867 --> 24:37.366
I don't need all this, right?

24:38.021 --> 24:39.224
I know.

24:39.860 --> 24:42.026
Just us is fine by me.

24:42.718 --> 24:44.068
I know that too.

24:46.667 --> 24:48.089
Let's box this up.

24:57.453 --> 24:58.740
I'm this far away.

24:59.336 --> 25:01.387
- From what?
- Respect.

25:02.406 --> 25:03.842
I'm saying, real

25:04.586 --> 25:05.859
proper respect.

25:07.013 --> 25:08.314
You deserve it.

25:11.883 --> 25:14.583
I'm sorry that you're sacrificed for that.

25:15.046 --> 25:16.250
Truly.

25:18.071 --> 25:19.800
You're fucking toast.

25:20.694 --> 25:22.134
And I like you.

25:23.816 --> 25:25.220
But you're all

25:25.401 --> 25:27.865
victims of friendly fire.

25:29.023 --> 25:30.340
Acceptable cost.

25:31.013 --> 25:33.220
What do you mean, "all victims"?

25:38.933 --> 25:40.393
You all are victims!

25:48.431 --> 25:50.482
But I might be going soft though.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.907
I couldn't go a job today.

25:55.982 --> 25:57.846
I formed an attachment.

26:00.282 --> 26:02.237
I had to send Kevin to do it.

26:02.943 --> 26:04.331
Kevin is...

26:04.956 --> 26:06.647
properly fucked up.

26:10.033 --> 26:11.705
Why don't you leave people alone?

26:14.940 --> 26:16.615
'Cause it's me versus them.

26:16.622 --> 26:17.831
Who's them?

26:18.120 --> 26:19.688
Everybody.

26:23.273 --> 26:25.682
It's my life, I didn't chose it.

26:31.869 --> 26:34.479
Tonight may be my last night.

26:36.411 --> 26:38.619
Let's make it one to remember.

26:40.762 --> 26:41.962
Salut!

26:52.072 --> 26:55.198
- Are you OK?
- Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?

26:55.318 --> 26:57.398
No reason. Just checking.

26:58.220 --> 27:00.559
Did Jean asked you to check?

27:00.931 --> 27:02.854
I'm not his fucking message boy.

27:03.498 --> 27:04.717
Anyway, I have to go.

27:05.152 --> 27:08.314
- We're about to set off.
- OK. Safe trip.

27:09.350 --> 27:10.582
And Julie,

27:10.820 --> 27:12.020
I'm sorry.

27:26.829 --> 27:29.506
- Was that Dad?
- No.

27:38.150 --> 27:39.780
Back in a sec.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.020
Maddy ?

28:12.574 --> 28:14.500
Oliver, is that you?

28:18.665 --> 28:20.080
- Welcome.
- Hello!

28:20.100 --> 28:22.355
Look at that!

28:22.375 --> 28:25.196
- Follow me.
- Oh yeah, we will.

28:25.444 --> 28:27.041
Hello, sunshine.

28:30.101 --> 28:32.020
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

28:32.067 --> 28:34.997
- Is there more like that?
- Yeah, upstairs. Go on.

28:35.117 --> 28:37.009
Oh my, that is...

28:37.010 --> 28:38.501
You're having a laugh?

28:47.501 --> 28:48.701
Woah!

28:51.091 --> 28:53.340
This is Geneviève.

28:55.199 --> 28:57.693
- Geneviève?
- Geneviève.

28:58.748 --> 29:00.300
This is Victor.

29:00.440 --> 29:02.511
I will see you on the other side.

29:10.145 --> 29:11.697
She knows about the condom, right?

29:11.740 --> 29:13.855
- She has her instructions.
- Good.

29:14.673 --> 29:17.419
Do you think she'll be
OK? He's pretty drunk.

29:17.539 --> 29:20.556
Geneviève could suck the
chrome off an exhaust pipe.

29:20.908 --> 29:23.104
She comes with a guarantee.

29:25.414 --> 29:29.056
Hello, you've reached Julie
Bastière. Please leave a message.

29:30.570 --> 29:32.044
Hey, it's me.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.375
Again.

29:48.392 --> 29:49.620
Nothing.

29:50.587 --> 29:52.339
I can't get anything.

29:52.377 --> 29:54.187
Fifty minutes I've been riding him,

29:54.188 --> 29:56.157
and I nearly got locked-jaw.

29:56.447 --> 29:59.580
I don't know what to say.
That's never happened before.

29:59.606 --> 30:01.288
Well, maybe she's not his type.

30:01.303 --> 30:03.682
I beg your pardon? Have you seen me?

30:48.277 --> 30:49.820
Come on...

31:12.120 --> 31:13.467
Used condom

31:13.932 --> 31:16.487
inside an evidence bag, inside the flask.

31:20.542 --> 31:22.378
We'll never talk about this.

31:22.676 --> 31:23.900
You OK?

31:24.749 --> 31:27.840
I am drunk, I just pulled off
a guy who fucks dead people.

31:28.049 --> 31:29.278
How do you think I am?

31:31.022 --> 31:33.822
Don't get too comfortable. Gregor called.

31:33.860 --> 31:35.375
He got a girl.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.580
Fucking...

32:02.133 --> 32:04.114
What the fuck are you doing?

32:05.675 --> 32:08.253
Spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.578
Could happen to anyone, any time.

32:10.698 --> 32:12.603
In a coma for three weeks.

32:12.706 --> 32:14.435
Passed away last night.

32:19.340 --> 32:20.540
You're in luck,

32:20.567 --> 32:23.130
diagnosed on a CT scan.

32:23.340 --> 32:26.195
So no post-mortem required
for cause of death.

32:27.017 --> 32:28.478
How old was she?

32:29.060 --> 32:31.016
- 22.
- What about her family?

32:31.018 --> 32:32.287
She was French.

32:32.601 --> 32:34.421
Working in a bar when it happened.

32:34.780 --> 32:37.405
Hospital weren't able to
make contact with family.

32:38.728 --> 32:41.039
She's like you, fifteen years ago.

32:41.788 --> 32:43.364
But prettier.

32:44.749 --> 32:46.585
OK, let's do this.

33:26.148 --> 33:27.540
Sign here.

33:28.253 --> 33:29.466
And here.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.260
Thank you.

33:34.164 --> 33:35.418
Victor?

33:37.468 --> 33:38.730
Sit up.

33:53.876 --> 33:55.093
Oh, look...

33:55.319 --> 33:57.057
it's the Kardashians.

33:59.109 --> 34:00.684
Fucking piece of shit!

34:00.685 --> 34:02.217
Wow, wow, wow, wow! Leave it, leave it!

34:02.217 --> 34:03.540
- Get your fucking hands off it!
- Leave it, leave it!

34:03.541 --> 34:05.022
You sick fuck!

34:05.023 --> 34:06.290
What the...!

34:06.291 --> 34:09.764
- What the fuck are you doing?
- He did it again!

34:09.764 --> 34:11.187
No, I didn't!

34:11.620 --> 34:13.214
- I did what?
- He killed a girl

34:13.222 --> 34:14.714
and fucked her in my wife's workshop!

34:14.833 --> 34:16.112
What?

34:16.350 --> 34:17.824
Fuck off!

34:20.074 --> 34:22.125
No, I went to the studio like you asked,

34:22.139 --> 34:24.619
- but I've done nothing to anyone!
- You sent him to Julie?

34:24.649 --> 34:26.567
To commission some pieces.

34:26.781 --> 34:28.788
Help get her business off the grounds.

34:29.078 --> 34:30.685
Little discreet assistance.

34:30.693 --> 34:32.822
Yeah, right. Send a guy
who fucks dead people.

34:32.822 --> 34:34.588
- I don't do that anymore.
- Nelson,

34:34.590 --> 34:36.811
I think we should reconvene
this at another time.

34:36.822 --> 34:38.420
He's been stalking my family.

34:38.927 --> 34:40.127
He's been in my bedroom!

34:40.128 --> 34:41.657
Hey, whoa whoa whoa! Watch it mate!

34:41.658 --> 34:43.132
- Easy, Rambo.
- He took pictures!

34:43.132 --> 34:46.531
- She invited me there.
- Rambo didn't have a fucking gun.

34:50.947 --> 34:52.998
He did in the fucking sequels.

34:54.993 --> 34:57.386
- What?
- Find your fucking discipline.

34:57.506 --> 34:59.668
Nelson, we really

34:59.669 --> 35:02.010
- shouldn't be part of this.
- With all due respect, Peter,

35:02.011 --> 35:03.762
Shut the fuck up.

35:05.194 --> 35:06.399
Right.

35:30.820 --> 35:32.138
Show me the girl.

35:32.294 --> 35:33.494
Oh, what?!

36:38.817 --> 36:40.347
She looks peaceful.

36:40.371 --> 36:42.415
She was smothered, with a pillow.

36:42.427 --> 36:44.948
That's why the blue
colouring around the eyes.

36:44.954 --> 36:46.704
I've never seen that
girl before in my life.

36:46.705 --> 36:47.965
What are you talking about?

36:48.060 --> 36:49.700
You were with her last night.

36:49.985 --> 36:50.915
What?

36:50.921 --> 36:52.292
At the whorehouse.

36:53.940 --> 36:56.552
He was very drunk, bothering
women at the bar we were at.

36:56.672 --> 36:59.300
I took him some place I
know, with clean girls.

36:59.330 --> 37:00.580
He seemed happy.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.219
- I left him there.
- No!

37:02.757 --> 37:03.957
- No.
- You weren't

37:03.958 --> 37:05.604
in the mood for companionship?

37:05.616 --> 37:07.513
I was. I did, twice.

37:08.272 --> 37:09.410
When did you bring her here?

37:09.429 --> 37:11.668
Well, I didn't. Shut the fuck
up! I've never seen her before?

37:11.693 --> 37:13.749
- But you have been here?
- Yes!

37:14.551 --> 37:16.420
Of course, with his wife!

37:17.780 --> 37:20.004
She thinks she's Terence fucking Conran.

37:27.028 --> 37:28.613
This is bullshit!

37:29.090 --> 37:30.589
It's a set-up!

37:32.763 --> 37:34.329
He's fucking Sonny.

37:37.860 --> 37:39.261
He is. Yesterday,

37:39.286 --> 37:41.954
he came to me for advice,
'cause he was coming to see you,

37:41.980 --> 37:43.900
to admit he was screwing your missus

37:43.924 --> 37:45.466
and take his punishment.

37:46.558 --> 37:47.761
Do I look like

37:48.128 --> 37:50.502
the self-sacrificing type to you?

37:50.820 --> 37:52.420
You leave my wife out of this!

37:52.448 --> 37:54.449
Fuck off. Maggie was your wife!

37:54.479 --> 37:55.985
Sonny's a gold-digger!

37:56.003 --> 37:57.355
He says another word,

37:57.475 --> 37:58.922
fucking shoot him!

38:12.100 --> 38:13.352
I know my brother.

38:13.377 --> 38:14.620
And this...

38:16.140 --> 38:18.621
- This isn't his style.
- It's a threat.

38:20.188 --> 38:22.180
He knows you're preparing to depart,

38:22.201 --> 38:24.540
that he will inherit everything.

38:25.610 --> 38:28.500
My wife, my kids, this...

38:29.869 --> 38:31.398
it's a message,

38:32.260 --> 38:35.584
that he can get me any time, anywhere.

38:36.485 --> 38:37.689
Why you?

38:39.121 --> 38:41.881
Jean exposed him when he
fucked the dead escort.

38:42.328 --> 38:44.292
Remember, the girl you burned.

38:45.963 --> 38:49.100
Until then, he was just a
happy little necrophiliac.

38:49.173 --> 38:51.020
Oh... fuck...

38:51.900 --> 38:53.101
you.

38:55.076 --> 38:57.591
I can't just take your word for this.

38:59.577 --> 39:00.780
Come.

39:02.480 --> 39:03.680
Bruises,

39:03.747 --> 39:05.540
on her breasts, and lower body,

39:05.660 --> 39:06.940
they were made post-mortem.

39:06.978 --> 39:10.001
No, th... that woman
was raped after she died.

39:11.294 --> 39:13.305
His semen is still present.

39:13.898 --> 39:15.183
It hasn't been absorbed

39:15.220 --> 39:16.976
the way it would inside of

39:17.282 --> 39:19.088
a warm-blooded person.

39:21.386 --> 39:22.592
Check it.

39:24.315 --> 39:27.151
- You're having a fucking laugh?
- Yeah, well this is fuckin' bollocks!

39:27.158 --> 39:30.660
it's a cover-up, 'cause
he's screwing your missus.

39:35.825 --> 39:38.406
- I can't tell.
- God gave you fingers, didn't he?

39:47.785 --> 39:48.992
And you,

39:50.890 --> 39:52.660
you think I can't do you damage?

39:54.920 --> 39:56.120
Oh!

39:56.522 --> 39:59.541
- I've got his fucking jizz on my hand!
- No!

39:59.740 --> 40:01.260
Fucking f...!

40:03.775 --> 40:05.678
I can have DNA results

40:05.697 --> 40:08.660
on this, within days, do you understand?

40:10.853 --> 40:12.342
Would that tell me

40:12.343 --> 40:14.270
that is my brother's sperm?

40:16.340 --> 40:17.965
- Yes, it would.
- No.

40:18.166 --> 40:21.180
- No.
- Then don't just fucking deny!

40:21.202 --> 40:23.520
Make it fucking plausible!

40:25.012 --> 40:27.162
Give an account of yourself.

40:28.526 --> 40:32.007
How did your fucking juice
end up on that dead girl?

40:40.892 --> 40:42.313
I don't know.

40:48.708 --> 40:50.324
If this is true,

40:51.307 --> 40:53.892
the responsibility is with me.

40:54.507 --> 40:56.036
You understand?

40:57.631 --> 40:58.940
Me!

41:06.860 --> 41:09.349
I can't look at any more dead girls.

41:09.368 --> 41:11.817
I need some fucking air.

41:16.580 --> 41:17.869
Bring him.

41:55.556 --> 41:57.340
I gotta tell you something.

41:57.357 --> 41:59.220
I don't think it's the right moment.

41:59.340 --> 42:02.208
Inside the dead girl, it's
not Victor's sperm, it's mine.

42:02.218 --> 42:03.541
What?

42:06.017 --> 42:09.067
If he tests it, we're fucking dead!

42:19.856 --> 42:22.305
I can't just take your word for this.

42:32.803 --> 42:34.820
Did you fuck my wife?

42:38.273 --> 42:41.580
Did you fuck my wife?

42:43.068 --> 42:44.478
No.

42:45.420 --> 42:47.008
He's lying! Do it!

42:51.825 --> 42:53.100
Do it!

43:19.020 --> 43:21.488
You said this day may come.

43:24.997 --> 43:26.740
He's my brother.

43:27.098 --> 43:29.350
And something's gotta give.

43:36.978 --> 43:38.740
Call Squire.

43:40.713 --> 43:43.471
Ask her about the killing
of Veysel Kisa and his wife,

43:44.060 --> 43:46.652
ask if there was anything unusual about it.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.513
Call your cop.

43:49.633 --> 43:51.380
You ordered those killings.

43:51.500 --> 43:55.387
Squire will tell you that somebody had sex
with the body of the wife after she died.

43:55.884 --> 43:59.112
Nah, she had a fucking hole in her...

44:00.726 --> 44:04.460
- Half her fucking face was missing, you...
- Ask her to pull the case file.

44:06.161 --> 44:07.385
Call her!

44:12.734 --> 44:15.500
Yeah, all right, I fucked...
I fucked the Turk's wife.

44:15.539 --> 44:17.146
I never touched that girl...

44:20.259 --> 44:23.357
What the fuck... fuck!

44:31.153 --> 44:33.152
Fuck.

45:02.395 --> 45:03.744
Help me.

45:21.938 --> 45:23.500
He stays there,

45:23.946 --> 45:27.296
he stays up there, as a
reminder of my fucking failure.

45:32.605 --> 45:34.212
This is on me.

45:34.580 --> 45:36.977
I let this sick man continue,

45:36.986 --> 45:39.500
because what? Because he's my brother.

45:43.554 --> 45:45.780
I should have broken his neck

45:46.416 --> 45:48.095
long time ago.

45:51.791 --> 45:53.688
You know what this is like,

45:54.831 --> 45:57.392
- don't you?
- No, I don't.

45:58.884 --> 46:00.510
We're not like you.

46:03.116 --> 46:04.589
Good for you.

46:07.863 --> 46:09.967
This depravity is on me.

46:20.211 --> 46:21.487
No!

46:24.958 --> 46:26.722
No!

46:39.558 --> 46:41.345
It's not your time, mate.

47:15.115 --> 47:16.533
What about him?

47:18.549 --> 47:21.837
We can't leave a body strung
up like that. This is London.

47:25.078 --> 47:26.457
We'll clean the girl.

47:27.980 --> 47:30.463
Fuck! What the fuck?

47:30.581 --> 47:33.513
Did... you stupid French fuck!

47:33.776 --> 47:36.460
Geez, fuck, shot me!

47:37.622 --> 47:39.949
It... it just clicked.

47:44.105 --> 47:47.692
? Run from me darlin' ?

47:50.926 --> 47:55.469
? Run my good wife ?

47:58.012 --> 48:02.197
? Run from me darlin' ?

48:04.119 --> 48:06.409
? You better run ?

48:06.529 --> 48:09.294
? For your life ?

48:12.177 --> 48:15.485
? Run from me baby ?

48:19.246 --> 48:22.298
? Run my good wife ?

48:22.299 --> 48:23.821
Is everything OK?

48:27.547 --> 48:30.493
You've been fucking Martin Bastière.

48:30.700 --> 48:33.086
Don't speak.

48:36.076 --> 48:38.553
I killed my brother today.

48:39.772 --> 48:41.658
I chose to do it.

48:42.746 --> 48:44.648
My choice.

48:46.218 --> 48:47.998
I'm choosing

48:48.245 --> 48:49.866
not to kill you.

48:51.641 --> 48:54.024
Again, my choice.

48:54.144 --> 48:56.585
- Nelson...
- Shh.

48:56.650 --> 49:00.018
? What I love most of all ?

49:00.103 --> 49:01.580
Be quiet.

49:01.625 --> 49:05.758
? Your swingin' gaze ?

49:08.708 --> 49:12.819
? Run from me darlin' ?

49:15.790 --> 49:19.762
? Run from my good wife ?

49:22.885 --> 49:27.147
? Run from me darlin' ?

49:28.965 --> 49:33.502
? You better run for your life ?

50:11.205 --> 50:12.955
I got something to show you.

50:16.599 --> 50:17.957
What's that?

50:23.326 --> 50:25.381
You keep old Christmas cards?

50:26.272 --> 50:27.783
Mom did.

50:30.616 --> 50:32.289
Look at the post marks.

50:33.018 --> 50:35.795
- Suriname.
- And Belize.

50:36.320 --> 50:37.780
Look...

50:38.703 --> 50:42.025
_

50:44.820 --> 50:46.143
Lucien Édouard Bastière.

50:46.161 --> 50:48.929
I found this in Mom's bag when
I drove her to the hospital.

50:50.871 --> 50:53.853
Look at the dates. One every year.

50:54.342 --> 50:56.058
This one is last year.

50:57.523 --> 50:59.222
I think he's still alive.

51:01.341 --> 51:04.153
I think our father may
have faked his own death.

51:04.569 --> 51:06.283
Why would he send cards?

51:06.999 --> 51:08.294
Love?

51:08.414 --> 51:09.860
Guilt?

51:12.685 --> 51:16.316
Well, if he's alive, he stayed
away for a quarter century.

51:17.697 --> 51:19.021
Fuck him.

51:42.886 --> 51:44.687
Oliver?

51:46.873 --> 51:48.515
Julie?

51:53.051 --> 51:55.003
They must be at Julie's mother's.

51:55.566 --> 51:57.396
It's still ringing out.

51:57.741 --> 51:59.302
Something's wrong.
