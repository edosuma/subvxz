<i>Do not make a tent on that ship.</i>

00:37.125 --> 00:39.296
<i>Never sleep in the house.</i>

00:40.105 --> 00:42.653
<i>Because you can find enemies within.</i>

00:45.600 --> 00:47.964
<i>When the Viking puts his shield,</i>

00:48.266 --> 00:50.594
<i>his sword in hand,</i>

00:50.595 --> 00:53.444

<i>Let it drive.
Let it drive.</i>

01:18.832 --> 01:21.562
<i>Best sink than hitting.</i>

01:22.518 --> 01:26.271
<i>For who hits is a slave to their fears.</i>

01:47.240 --> 01:48.864
Down sail!

01:50.350 --> 01:51.831
Bjorn!

03:55.998 --> 03:57.555
Come on, boy.

03:58.096 --> 03:59.395
Wake up!

04:10.733 --> 04:12.032
<i>Where are we?</i>

04:13.181 --> 04:15.577
<i>Lindisfarne, not sure.</i>

04:16.976 --> 04:18.872
In enemy lines.

04:19.673 --> 04:21.865
Behind Allied lines.

04:23.969 --> 04:25.691
What Allied lines?

04:28.164 --> 04:29.463
Come on.

04:47.144 --> 04:50.341
My runes will protect you
on your journey, my friend.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.328
What are you doing?

04:52.329 --> 04:54.472
He needs it more than i do.

04:54.473 --> 04:56.335
What happens when you die?

04:56.834 --> 04:58.599
I will not be dead.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.257
All right, men.

05:17.712 --> 05:20.109
ascend climb the way to Lindesfarne.

05:20.110 --> 05:22.121
First, we have to leave this coast.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.305
We do not know where we are.

05:27.801 --> 05:29.549
Down here we will drown.

05:29.945 --> 05:31.330
This is crazy.

05:32.174 --> 05:34.594
I am a warrior, not a climber.

05:35.334 --> 05:36.883
You heard the man.

05:43.585 --> 05:46.261
Your father would be so proud of you.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.378
Let it him.

05:50.178 --> 05:52.164
We will need every men.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.421
Asbjørn.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.158
<i>Stop!</i>

07:48.752 --> 07:50.524
That is friend you welcome.

07:51.249 --> 07:52.675
What did you expect?

07:53.470 --> 07:55.176
Meet woman fog?

07:58.551 --> 07:59.991
<i>All archers!</i>

08:07.832 --> 08:09.251

08:13.925 --> 08:15.224
Spread out.

08:17.022 --> 08:19.894
Use what you can and make it count.

08:24.561 --> 08:27.059
Valhalla!

08:39.698 --> 08:40.996
Asbjørn.

09:40.441 --> 09:42.147
Valli!

10:53.213 --> 10:55.571
It will not take long for him
to get reinforcements.

11:31.796 --> 11:33.821
Your brother wait you in Valhalla.

11:34.590 --> 11:36.861
Asbjorn, come here.

11:37.532 --> 11:39.131
He comes with us.

11:39.132 --> 11:42.205
Asbjorn, you must leave me here.

11:43.929 --> 11:46.501
He's right. He only in the delay us.

11:46.502 --> 11:48.847
None of us will be left behind.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.183
Help him.

11:51.813 --> 11:53.213
Let me off.

11:54.660 --> 11:57.065
As you wish, warrior.

12:04.681 --> 12:07.413
Put Up. That.

12:07.414 --> 12:08.874
Come on.

12:12.381 --> 12:13.781
What we have here?

12:25.530 --> 12:26.929
Open it.

12:49.674 --> 12:52.366
What a pretty bird you free.

12:59.224 --> 13:01.764
Who are you and why are you
locked in the carriage?

13:04.587 --> 13:07.362
Scottish. I told her.

13:07.814 --> 13:09.214
Scotland.

13:09.684 --> 13:11.792
We are further than we thought.

13:11.793 --> 13:15.065
where they eat man like you for breakfast.

13:15.066 --> 13:16.510
We better get out.

13:16.511 --> 13:19.552
The next colonization must be the South.

13:20.297 --> 13:22.536
Two or maybe three days.

13:22.537 --> 13:25.046
They never let us get empty handed.

13:25.047 --> 13:28.228
We're not empty handed.

13:28.229 --> 13:30.503
Look at the bross.

13:31.599 --> 13:34.696
And the gold bright in her dress.

13:34.697 --> 13:38.390
This bird is special.

13:38.391 --> 13:41.879
And bird specials give
special bounty.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.369
- Enought to pay for all?
- For sure.

13:45.370 --> 13:47.191
I am right?

13:50.199 --> 13:52.766
Jorund, take your hands away.

13:52.767 --> 13:57.419
Jorund! Take your hands away.

13:57.922 --> 14:01.103
You not under the command
of King Harald any more.

14:15.543 --> 14:16.841
Aih. Aih

14:17.929 --> 14:19.706
Hell's, man.

14:21.053 --> 14:24.197
I do not get near that if I were you.

14:26.117 --> 14:29.528
If you can understand me,
I need you to come with us.

14:29.529 --> 14:30.828
If you behave ...

14:38.873 --> 14:40.906
If you behave your self

14:41.717 --> 14:43.638
nothing will happen to you.

14:43.639 --> 14:46.682
When your people pay the summon,
you will be free.

14:46.683 --> 14:48.109
I give you my word.

14:51.499 --> 14:54.447
We probably have one or two days
most before they to come.

14:55.124 --> 14:57.096
Before who come?

14:57.097 --> 14:59.096
Think no one will lack this woman?

14:59.097 --> 15:00.795
Believe me, someone is coming.

15:24.334 --> 15:26.370
Bride's messenger is at the gate.

15:26.371 --> 15:27.770
Good.

15:29.779 --> 15:31.940
You seem distracted.

15:31.941 --> 15:33.860
No worries, I hope.

15:33.861 --> 15:36.127
I gave my only child.

15:36.673 --> 15:39.061
It's a terrible day for any man.

15:42.404 --> 15:44.757
Unleash the great fire.

15:58.988 --> 16:03.470
We join tonight to celebrate
the marriage of my daughter,

16:03.471 --> 16:06.843
The Inghean with the Gret lord Murdill.

16:06.844 --> 16:10.226
For them, the great fire will burn until ...

16:16.024 --> 16:18.449
- My king.
- Speak, man.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.457
We were attacked by Vikings.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.750
They took her as a prisoner, my king.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.352
Bovarr.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.024
No, my king ...

16:32.717 --> 16:34.016
raise.

16:36.152 --> 16:39.016
Tell me ... How it possible

16:39.017 --> 16:42.200
twenty of the king best mens...

16:42.201 --> 16:45.863
...lose the king's daughter
to view common Nordic?

16:45.864 --> 16:49.428
We think the climb cliff, about twelve.

16:49.429 --> 16:52.330
Now they are with Inghean Lady
and you are here, free.

16:53.476 --> 16:55.473
You think this is fair?

16:58.904 --> 17:00.369
But, my king... No

17:01.322 --> 17:02.675
No, wait.

17:22.444 --> 17:24.558
That was even necessary, mercenary?

17:24.559 --> 17:26.983
This was only a lesson to his officers,

17:26.983 --> 17:29.338
different from what you think of liberation.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.893
But can not question a dead man, can you?

17:31.894 --> 17:34.293
We know everything we need.

17:34.294 --> 17:38.004
His daughter is in the hands
of some Vikings without resources.

17:38.005 --> 17:40.696
Otherwise, would not climb the cliff.

17:41.214 --> 17:43.972
They know how to use their weapons.

17:44.482 --> 17:48.823
No need to look twice
to know that it is valuable.

17:51.367 --> 17:54.552
You bring my daughter back alive,

17:55.289 --> 17:57.453
I will pay generously...

17:58.166 --> 18:01.198
If you can not free it,

18:02.256 --> 18:03.764
You know what to do.

18:03.765 --> 18:06.464
Inghean should be considered
lucky to have

18:06.465 --> 18:08.001
a father as responsible.

18:08.002 --> 18:09.303
How dare are you?

18:09.304 --> 18:11.731
If my enemies see that some Vikings

18:11.732 --> 18:13.301
can extort the king,

18:13.302 --> 18:17.801
How long you think it will take up
to a Lord turn against me?

18:18.698 --> 18:21.144
Do not forget your impertinence.

18:21.145 --> 18:24.391
Better not forget to crush
your enemies, my king.

18:35.957 --> 18:37.666
Little brother ...

18:41.760 --> 18:43.459
We left immediately.

19:03.337 --> 19:05.356
You all will die.

19:08.271 --> 19:10.672
Or I learned Scottish,

19:11.207 --> 19:15.188
or that bird is chirping in our language.

19:15.702 --> 19:18.424
Let me go and save their lives.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.397
Listen, bird.

19:21.432 --> 19:23.191
If we let you go,

19:23.940 --> 19:26.291
did not get the reward,

19:26.292 --> 19:30.703
and without reward, we do not pay our freedom.

19:34.754 --> 19:36.153
How is the Bjorn?

19:50.988 --> 19:52.287
Bjorn...

19:54.684 --> 19:56.983
Should have left me behind.

19:56.984 --> 19:58.283
Do Not.

20:03.031 --> 20:04.734
We need to find a healer.

20:07.271 --> 20:09.169
Otherwise, he has no chance.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.464
Lobos,

20:13.465 --> 20:15.662
we are haunt to collect.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.687
Let's hunt.

21:48.075 --> 21:50.743
We will not find the healer here.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.058
What happened here?

22:16.034 --> 22:17.333
No.

22:21.186 --> 22:24.326
What.. What was that?

22:25.824 --> 22:29.221
So the bird is a witch.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.918
- Take your hands off me.
- Jorund!

22:36.940 --> 22:40.054
You are under my command.

22:40.055 --> 22:43.640
- Hird.
- What you call me?

22:45.203 --> 22:46.502
You heard me.

22:47.155 --> 22:48.700
So what will you do?

22:58.280 --> 23:02.017
His father never let that happen.

23:02.018 --> 23:03.543
My father is dead.

23:04.459 --> 23:06.453
And you're under my command now.

23:06.454 --> 23:09.267
Or continues with this,
or are free to go alone.

23:23.174 --> 23:24.473
Come here.

23:31.725 --> 23:34.654
- Do not do it again.
- Or what?

23:34.655 --> 23:37.599
You will not kill me.
Life'm useless to you.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.047
Truth.

23:39.048 --> 23:42.745
But if bruised,
your father still pay the same.

24:28.358 --> 24:29.657
Who are you?

24:32.119 --> 24:34.961
Since here, obviously is not your land,

24:35.472 --> 24:37.174
I should ask you first.

24:39.032 --> 24:40.597
I am Asbjørn.

24:41.409 --> 24:42.707
Son of Egill.

24:43.978 --> 24:46.480
So tell me Asbjorn, son of Egill ...

24:47.764 --> 24:51.284
What you and your troop seek this part of the country?

24:51.285 --> 24:52.732
People are poor.

24:52.733 --> 24:55.765
There are monasteries to invade.

24:55.766 --> 24:59.512
There are still some languages ​​to cut.

25:00.840 --> 25:02.545
We need to find a healer

25:02.546 --> 25:05.273
for our wounded friend. Christian monk.

25:24.835 --> 25:28.342
He will not last a day. He needs shelter.

25:32.793 --> 25:34.385
This is not a good place.

25:35.449 --> 25:36.748
What was that?

25:41.412 --> 25:45.518
One of movement and the cute dies.

25:47.525 --> 25:49.709
Release it, sir. She is mine.

25:52.289 --> 25:55.900
Cute. Drop your weapons.

25:57.719 --> 25:59.117
Dropping.

26:03.048 --> 26:04.346
Dropping.

26:07.590 --> 26:10.087
Move back. Back!

26:12.484 --> 26:15.273
That archer. Drop it now.

26:15.663 --> 26:17.061
Thorald?

26:18.024 --> 26:19.657
Let Go.

26:35.186 --> 26:36.494
Back away!

26:36.911 --> 26:38.536
<i>Run.</i>

26:38.938 --> 26:42.153
- Not bad for a monk.
- Yeah, he's very good.

26:42.849 --> 26:44.794
You will find shelter here.

26:45.259 --> 26:47.123
And why should we trust you?

26:47.124 --> 26:48.696
You do not need have to.

27:23.532 --> 27:25.374
Lay your friend here.

27:27.919 --> 27:29.595
Get the fire stuff.

27:35.897 --> 27:37.962
Ha enough guns to declare war

27:37.963 --> 27:39.552
the whole Britain.

27:39.553 --> 27:42.037
Weapons are the remains of men

27:42.038 --> 27:45.060
who, like you, confronted me.

27:45.061 --> 27:46.610
Six.

27:59.026 --> 28:00.325
Hold it.

28:06.532 --> 28:07.830
Do not fight.

28:14.958 --> 28:17.152
It's all I can do for now.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.285
It entertain here until dawn.

28:32.853 --> 28:34.723
We stand here tonight,

28:34.724 --> 28:37.268
Bjorn to regain his strength,

28:37.269 --> 28:38.767
and then continued.

28:39.229 --> 28:41.476
Do not make a tent on that ship.

28:42.126 --> 28:44.843
Never sleep in the house.

28:46.213 --> 28:48.719
It may find enemies within.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.019
I know.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.184
Do not trust this monk.

28:52.495 --> 28:56.386
He prays for peace and
governs with the sword.

28:57.938 --> 29:00.189
I take the first round.

29:11.295 --> 29:13.643
When they know that we are behind them,

29:13.644 --> 29:15.472
will kill her and leave her behind.

29:17.420 --> 29:20.385
He said he wants us to take back alive.

29:21.190 --> 29:22.913
Dunchaid is an old man.

29:24.082 --> 29:25.810
Considered what will happen to us

29:25.811 --> 29:28.024
when Inghean and her husband reign?

29:31.835 --> 29:34.227
That's why we can not bring it alive.

29:34.745 --> 29:37.111
The reward is still great.

29:39.346 --> 29:43.064
I'll talk to them that the king's
decision is to murder your daughter.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.469
Then he said, "Come to me,

30:02.470 --> 30:06.215
all you who are weary and burdened

30:06.216 --> 30:08.237
e had your aliviarei. "

30:08.666 --> 30:11.279
- Who said that?
- The Son of God.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.174
The man who died on the cross?

30:13.828 --> 30:15.331
It's just a symbol.

30:15.332 --> 30:18.444
The way I see it,
your God is weak ...

30:19.076 --> 30:21.655
and our gods are strong, so ...

30:28.178 --> 30:30.908
What brings you to this earth, Nordic?

30:34.144 --> 30:36.707
We were banned from our homeland.

30:37.069 --> 30:40.506
Then our boat sank off the coast near here.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.364
Now we need to buy our entry

30:42.365 --> 30:44.658
in one of the Viking settlements south.

30:45.683 --> 30:48.606
So your plan is to receive
a reward for prisoner?

30:48.607 --> 30:50.769
You're not so dumb for a Christian.

30:51.069 --> 30:53.755
And you're not so smart for a pagan.

30:53.756 --> 30:56.786
Any idea who she is?

31:03.636 --> 31:05.657
Of noble birth

31:06.260 --> 31:08.711
perhaps a daughter of ...

31:08.712 --> 31:10.011
King?

31:10.812 --> 31:15.409
Yes. You fools,
captured the Inghean Lady.

31:15.410 --> 31:18.227
Daughter of King Dunchaid.

31:23.532 --> 31:25.015
Great.

31:26.891 --> 31:29.289
Now we can ask for a greater reward.

31:30.001 --> 31:32.892
There will be no reward in hell.

31:33.815 --> 31:36.793
Cause exactly where he will send them.

31:41.182 --> 31:45.220
You will leave at dawn,
then try to sleep.

31:45.221 --> 31:48.812
Only a Nordic rested can loot and plunder.

32:12.621 --> 32:13.919
Ah!

32:20.295 --> 32:23.149
I have nothing! I know nothing!

32:23.950 --> 32:25.550
Have you asked him?

32:26.021 --> 32:28.144
The direction came,

32:28.695 --> 32:30.835
may have seen some Nordic.

32:31.988 --> 32:34.827
If I say, let me go?

32:53.382 --> 32:55.444
Audrin were nearby the tower.

32:55.445 --> 32:57.434
It was there where we find them.

32:57.435 --> 32:59.265
But we were defeated.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.012
The Cursed Monk.

33:02.013 --> 33:03.557
Killed most of us.

33:03.937 --> 33:06.630
- And they had a girl?
- Yeah.

33:07.790 --> 33:09.984
But they are planning something.

33:09.985 --> 33:13.033
Maybe the monk brought them to him.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.715
To the tower it.

33:15.109 --> 33:16.975
Maybe so.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.826
Will you let me go?

33:36.014 --> 33:39.451
<i>There was a beast in the wood</i>

33:39.452 --> 33:43.224
<i>I wanted to take the blood of
a thousand Vikings</i>

33:43.225 --> 33:46.883
<i>In fact, men are still howling</i>

33:46.884 --> 33:50.306
<i>And screamed that could eat a thousand</i>

33:50.307 --> 33:53.934
<i>But I was one and could not stagger</i>

33:53.935 --> 33:57.338
<i>And so I took my trusty ax and shield</i>

33:57.339 --> 34:01.045
<i>I found the creature in the forest</i>

34:01.046 --> 34:04.482
<i>And now take the blood of the monster</i>

34:16.402 --> 34:18.748
The rest is in God's hands.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.655
Or on who you believe.

34:28.063 --> 34:29.646
What r u doing?

34:41.130 --> 34:44.435
- He will recover.
- He will not.

34:46.607 --> 34:48.260
And you know it.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.431
Why not let me go?

34:52.797 --> 34:56.290
You have no idea who my father is capable.

34:57.881 --> 35:00.857
He sure is able to pay for you.

35:00.858 --> 35:03.708
Your father is not the first king
with which read.

35:07.709 --> 35:11.560
<i>And now take drink the blood of the monster</i>

35:15.906 --> 35:17.343
How is the Bjorn?

35:17.344 --> 35:19.031
Come drink with us.

35:20.111 --> 35:22.444
And I thought I did not trust the monk.

35:22.445 --> 35:25.885
We do not trust. But he has mead.

35:25.886 --> 35:27.785
You gave them mead?

35:28.342 --> 35:30.127
They did not ask.

35:31.705 --> 35:34.704
Grab your weapons. We start today.

35:50.585 --> 35:52.685
Finch?

35:53.094 --> 35:54.877
Still with us?

35:59.708 --> 36:01.315
Take your breath.

36:02.983 --> 36:05.980
You will need it when you go to Valhalla.

36:20.768 --> 36:23.079
I have been to many achievements.

36:23.379 --> 36:25.377
I heard many beliefs.

36:27.872 --> 36:29.865
Why would our true?

36:30.944 --> 36:32.588
Why not?

36:36.753 --> 36:38.517
In fact, why not?

36:43.018 --> 36:45.748
So you are outlaw?

36:47.182 --> 36:49.312
Yes, we are the last.

36:50.424 --> 36:54.756
The latter not under
the command of King Harald.

36:56.204 --> 36:59.672
When Harald conquered my land,

36:59.673 --> 37:02.031
My father did not give up like the others.

37:02.032 --> 37:03.452
He fought.

37:04.705 --> 37:07.834
When he was killed, took his ship

37:07.835 --> 37:10.285
and what's left of our men,

37:10.286 --> 37:12.057
and let our home.

37:13.141 --> 37:16.082
And now the king put their heads the prize.

37:16.781 --> 37:18.080
Yes.

37:18.750 --> 37:21.079
And what will you do with the woman

37:21.080 --> 37:23.249
when King Dunchaid not pay?

37:23.250 --> 37:25.411
What kind of father would not pay?

37:33.152 --> 37:35.391
Give me your word

37:35.392 --> 37:38.761
that will not touch a girl's hair.

37:41.242 --> 37:43.426
How you can?

37:45.455 --> 37:47.479
Do not believe the rumors.

37:47.480 --> 37:50.640
Not all pagans are evil.

37:53.481 --> 37:56.119
"From the fury of the Norsemen,

37:56.120 --> 37:57.938
realise us, O Lord. "

38:09.798 --> 38:11.869
Bjorn, the son of Ovar,

38:11.870 --> 38:14.224
is already on the way to Valhalla.

38:14.848 --> 38:17.126
We met there, my friend.

39:08.729 --> 39:10.424
Where to now?

39:29.220 --> 39:30.727
Enter the tower!

39:30.728 --> 39:32.738
We trapped inside.

39:32.739 --> 39:34.629
Then die out here.

39:36.632 --> 39:38.641
- Come In! Come In!
- No.

39:55.224 --> 39:57.113
"If I am a man of God,

39:57.713 --> 40:01.405
send the prophet Elijah
to the captain and his fifty men."

40:02.014 --> 40:04.303
What this crazy monk saying?

40:06.822 --> 40:08.143
"That fire

40:08.144 --> 40:10.988
descend from heaven

40:11.802 --> 40:13.373
and consume them! "

40:42.679 --> 40:44.440
This will hold them for a while.

40:47.280 --> 40:52.228
<i>Darts!</i>

40:53.750 --> 40:57.757
<i>Darts!</i>

40:59.649 --> 41:04.451
<i>Darts!</i>

41:09.093 --> 41:10.410
Men!

41:19.269 --> 41:20.577
Bring him inside.

41:24.286 --> 41:25.589
Turn off or fogo!

41:37.541 --> 41:38.844
Who are you?

41:40.617 --> 41:42.692
We came for her.

41:45.766 --> 41:48.712
Her father sent us to kill her.

41:50.710 --> 41:53.887
You're lying. You are lying!

41:54.875 --> 41:58.597
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth!

42:04.754 --> 42:06.062
No!

42:17.962 --> 42:21.232
This does not seem to be a rescue mission.

42:29.091 --> 42:30.417
We have to get out of here.

42:30.418 --> 42:32.314
Thanks to the monk, we are stuck.

42:32.315 --> 42:34.752
O thou of little faith.

42:45.134 --> 42:47.437
Take as many weapons as you can carrie.

42:58.293 --> 42:59.594
Come on.

43:26.817 --> 43:28.128
Follow me.

43:35.449 --> 43:37.424
We have no choice.

44:07.951 --> 44:09.868
I need to see the bodies.

44:28.703 --> 44:30.164
Where are they?

44:57.926 --> 44:59.491
Clever.

45:11.279 --> 45:13.586
What do you know about them?

45:15.569 --> 45:17.965
We need to know who our enemies are.

45:17.966 --> 45:19.563
Feel honored.

45:19.564 --> 45:22.988
He sent the best men,
his Pack of Wolves.

45:23.446 --> 45:26.913
They came from a mountain,
somewhere east.

45:26.914 --> 45:28.418
The Carpathians.

45:28.419 --> 45:31.189
There are still a lot of killers.

45:31.190 --> 45:34.376
For me, they never would
step on this earth.

45:35.275 --> 45:36.982
And if it was for me,

45:36.983 --> 45:39.749
you stay here, out of our way.

45:40.890 --> 45:42.737
She is useless.

45:43.161 --> 45:46.742
Her father will not pay for it.
He wants her dead.

45:47.741 --> 45:50.153
If we send the mercenaries,

45:50.154 --> 45:53.387
at least we have a chance
to leave the country.

45:53.388 --> 45:55.973
Jorund, you're so dumb like that?

45:57.400 --> 45:59.544
Perhaps the father will not pay,

45:59.545 --> 46:01.706
but any enemy certainly will.

46:02.680 --> 46:04.076
Now, move.

46:19.118 --> 46:21.023
Where are you taking us?

46:21.482 --> 46:22.895
Have patience.

46:29.750 --> 46:31.096
What does it mean?

46:32.184 --> 46:34.320
Says about the path of the serpent,

46:34.321 --> 46:36.862
an old route to the south.

46:36.863 --> 46:40.279
- To Danelaw. - Danelaw, is a city?

46:42.434 --> 46:43.921
O homeland?

46:43.922 --> 46:46.530
It is not a city,
but can be a Viking civilization

46:46.531 --> 46:48.174
where we can be safe.

46:49.221 --> 46:51.372
What are this? Boats?

46:54.210 --> 46:55.514
His knife.

47:07.561 --> 47:09.724
This is the coast.

47:11.258 --> 47:13.482
That was my tower.

47:15.747 --> 47:17.047
The plateaus,

47:17.766 --> 47:19.151
water,

47:20.568 --> 47:22.064
a Danelaw.

47:22.065 --> 47:25.219
- Simple as that?
- Simple as that. But here.

47:26.137 --> 47:29.480
The King Dunchaid has a fortified line.

47:30.218 --> 47:32.044
So let's cross.

47:32.045 --> 47:34.739
Not even his army succeeded.

47:34.740 --> 47:36.196
But this is not the way.

47:36.197 --> 47:39.500
With boats, as in painting,

47:39.501 --> 47:42.165
We can work around the fortress.

47:42.166 --> 47:45.383
Now. We will be led by a monk?

47:45.384 --> 47:48.165
And if he would take us into a trap?

47:48.166 --> 47:49.892
He will not lead you.

47:50.331 --> 47:52.940
There is no option but
to accept their help.

47:52.941 --> 47:55.924
Asbjorn, the monk is not one of us,

47:55.925 --> 47:58.459
he is a Christian, you should rethink.

47:58.460 --> 48:00.056
Who gave us shelter?

48:00.535 --> 48:02.601
Who helped us escape?

48:02.602 --> 48:04.615
If we wanted dead, we would already be.

48:04.616 --> 48:06.155
He had many chances.

48:07.659 --> 48:10.490
The decision is yours. And I ...

48:11.097 --> 48:14.367
I'll be watching this monk.

48:32.367 --> 48:33.984
Snake Way.

48:34.822 --> 48:37.527
<i>The peaks. Used to climb and hunt.</i>

48:37.528 --> 48:40.042
<i>It crosses the highlands</i>

48:40.043 --> 48:42.687
<i>and ends at sea.</i>

48:43.237 --> 48:46.420
It is there that the Basques
are in cracks in the cliff.

48:46.869 --> 48:49.703
The next full moon, winter rains begin.

48:50.322 --> 48:52.736
And the cracks flood until spring.

48:52.737 --> 48:56.061
- It is in a few days.
- Just a moment.

48:56.062 --> 48:58.179
What do you get with this, monk?

49:00.455 --> 49:02.144
Thank you,

49:02.145 --> 49:04.915
I also have to protect me.

49:05.290 --> 49:08.186
Not because gain reward for a Vikings?

49:08.187 --> 49:11.930
- Everyone wants to talk?
- Stop! All of you!

49:12.540 --> 49:15.055
You have no idea what they are facing.

49:15.370 --> 49:18.594
The more time we lose,
the more the Wolves approach.

49:18.595 --> 49:22.796
Are riding. When they find our trail,
they catch us.

49:26.243 --> 49:28.229
Should hear his prisoner.

49:30.537 --> 49:32.465
We are to slow down.

49:51.332 --> 49:52.719
Come on!

50:40.634 --> 50:42.202
That way.

50:50.660 --> 50:51.964
Wait.

50:53.661 --> 50:55.622
How if an ambush?

50:56.737 --> 50:58.932
What is the problem if an ambush?

51:00.386 --> 51:01.772
Lets go!

51:52.775 --> 51:55.812
- My little brother.
- Put it on the horse.

51:56.899 --> 51:58.522
And the wounded?

52:00.389 --> 52:01.877
Let's move on.

52:27.570 --> 52:29.984
- Assemble your horses.
- Come on.

52:36.304 --> 52:38.010
They are already coming.

52:38.011 --> 52:40.697
And why should we believe you?

52:41.563 --> 52:44.011
I see what the land tells me.

52:44.860 --> 52:47.044
- Of course.
- enought.

52:48.076 --> 52:51.121
- Keep moving.
- Yes.

52:51.122 --> 52:53.710
<i>With horses, they soon overtake us.</i>

53:02.281 --> 53:04.755
We need to reach them before the cliff.

53:18.275 --> 53:19.805
Move it!

53:19.806 --> 53:21.430
He will not get.

53:29.170 --> 53:30.570
Thorald.

53:45.093 --> 53:46.715
Almost there.

53:53.249 --> 53:54.633
Come on.

54:38.230 --> 54:39.631
We'll get.

54:50.589 --> 54:51.965
Daughter.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.238
Are you hurt?

54:56.211 --> 54:57.977
I think not.

54:57.978 --> 54:59.301
Keep!

55:00.253 --> 55:02.111
We need to go now.

55:02.625 --> 55:04.395
You came back for me.

55:23.525 --> 55:25.601
You let loose your puppies?

55:27.117 --> 55:30.529
And yours? You seem to be alone.

55:36.852 --> 55:38.315
Lady Inghean,

55:39.878 --> 55:42.270
his father is worried about you.

55:45.284 --> 55:47.134
Now, give it to me.

56:01.233 --> 56:03.310
So be like a Nordic.

56:14.980 --> 56:15.650
Back.

56:23.718 --> 56:26.202
- We must follow them.
- No!

56:26.203 --> 56:28.079
We wait.

56:31.989 --> 56:34.654
- We wait.
- Not so fast.

56:34.655 --> 56:37.009
We need to find a way to stop them here.

56:37.010 --> 56:39.359
Or will not achieve the boats.

56:39.360 --> 56:42.152
Thorald, stay here and
be careful with the Wolves.

56:42.153 --> 56:44.966
The others, follow me.
We have work to do.

57:20.086 --> 57:23.214
A man is watching the way. The archer.

57:27.970 --> 57:30.876
- It's a Viking sword.
- Yes it is.

57:30.877 --> 57:33.726
I always felt that
she was waiting for someone.

57:34.766 --> 57:38.618
"If I do not want to pieces,
just kill my opponent."

57:40.759 --> 57:45.703
<i>Help My dear Tilt, I promise you receive it,</i>

57:45.704 --> 57:48.884
<i>through fire, blood and steel.</i>

57:54.222 --> 57:56.133
Their gods help us?

57:56.134 --> 58:00.164
- Yes.
- Of course, as always.

58:01.995 --> 58:04.510
I know Tilt help us.

58:05.177 --> 58:09.330
I prefer to believe in the kind of worldly help.

58:13.704 --> 58:15.536
This will work.

58:44.414 --> 58:45.853
Great.

59:12.276 --> 59:13.767
You're early.

59:14.622 --> 59:17.792
Go rest. I stand guard.

59:18.911 --> 59:21.114
And I hope they appear.

59:25.895 --> 59:28.811
Looks like someone's crazy about Valhalla.

59:49.580 --> 59:51.386
So ...

59:51.993 --> 59:54.770
This is how you Christians pray, is not it?

59:55.401 --> 59:58.380
I prayed this morning in all possible ways i can.

01:00:00.838 --> 01:00:04.783
But this is not enough to stop the king's men.

01:00:05.866 --> 01:00:08.882
One day, I was sent to one of
the most dangerous places,

01:00:08.883 --> 01:00:10.444
by a man of God.

01:00:11.159 --> 01:00:12.858
To the Land of the Vikings.

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:18.865
But not only won their confidence.

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:21.851
They accepted me as one of them,

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:23.450
without bloodshed.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.278
The King Dunchaid was at war with them.

01:00:27.712 --> 01:00:30.130
To end the bloodshed,

01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:32.073
he asked me to mediate.

01:00:32.788 --> 01:00:34.086
So ...

01:00:34.696 --> 01:00:37.851
Convinced all the leaders
to go talk to the king.

01:00:38.726 --> 01:00:41.309
Dunchaid killed them all.

01:00:41.995 --> 01:00:44.731
And those who life, were enslaved.

01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:47.748
- You did not know.
- I should know.

01:00:49.384 --> 01:00:51.008
I should save them ...

01:00:51.762 --> 01:00:53.347
but I failed.

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:57.557
I returned to my order,
to live in solitude.

01:00:58.278 --> 01:01:00.964
God transformed the solitary in a home.

01:01:01.663 --> 01:01:04.454
But the rebels live in those lands.

01:01:05.409 --> 01:01:07.530
You are with us now.

01:01:09.423 --> 01:01:11.326
A monk can become a rebel?

01:01:12.452 --> 01:01:14.547
And a Viking could not?

01:01:19.504 --> 01:01:21.763
We will not survive.

01:01:23.856 --> 01:01:25.451
Will we one day the sun will rise,

01:01:25.452 --> 01:01:28.745
without you be complaining
like a little woman?

01:01:28.746 --> 01:01:30.144
<i>Hird.</i>

01:01:33.992 --> 01:01:35.461
Douchebag ...

01:01:36.229 --> 01:01:38.152
If you call me that

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.532
once again ...

01:01:41.846 --> 01:01:44.269
- Than what?
- Enough!

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:47.851
The Wolves are difficult to fight, rest now.

01:01:47.852 --> 01:01:49.761
We leave at dawn.

01:01:54.817 --> 01:01:56.335
What is a Hird?

01:01:59.277 --> 01:02:02.333
The Hirds are the faithful
guards of King Harald.

01:02:02.846 --> 01:02:04.532
Hjorr was one.

01:02:05.204 --> 01:02:09.082
It was until the king got rid
of all that descordavam it.

01:02:09.083 --> 01:02:11.051
I mean man like you?

01:02:14.215 --> 01:02:15.989
Hjorr met me in the war.

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:17.765
He fought with me and my father.

01:02:18.825 --> 01:02:22.205
After all the defeats, he fled with us.

01:02:23.267 --> 01:02:25.871
You are not welcome among his own people?

01:02:29.411 --> 01:02:31.030
Just like you.

01:03:02.834 --> 01:03:05.244
Tonight should be the night of my wedding.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.638
Do not worry, my heart is not broken.

01:03:09.639 --> 01:03:12.085
It's my dad's strategic plan.

01:03:13.752 --> 01:03:16.565
This explains why we are in the same boat.

01:03:21.609 --> 01:03:24.170
I can not imagine it as a kind wife.

01:03:24.865 --> 01:03:26.584
Quiet and obedient.

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:31.496
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:06:22.919 --> 01:06:24.306
They are here!

01:06:26.295 --> 01:06:27.594
Haldor.

01:06:29.468 --> 01:06:30.793
Where is Haldor?

01:06:31.249 --> 01:06:32.803
Where is he?

01:06:33.237 --> 01:06:35.419
- Grim.
- Haldor?

01:06:36.478 --> 01:06:37.885
Haldor!

01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:42.100
We can not leave him!

01:06:42.869 --> 01:06:46.609
When you succeed, Haldor will be happy.

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.295
But not now!
Not here!

01:06:49.632 --> 01:06:50.930
Look out!

01:07:06.267 --> 01:07:07.566
No!

01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:28.634
Stay tuned.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.014
Run!

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:07.273
Now what?

01:09:09.058 --> 01:09:12.710
we Walked and swam,
now go through there.

01:09:16.997 --> 01:09:19.689
Nordic!

01:09:25.796 --> 01:09:27.207
And I will slow you down.

01:09:28.224 --> 01:09:29.679
Pelo, Haldor.

01:09:30.312 --> 01:09:31.654
We will.

01:09:31.654 --> 01:09:34.020
- The rest, go to the bridge.
- You heard him.

01:09:34.022 --> 01:09:37.554
Take care of her,
my friend. Defend that bridge.

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:42.250
Vikings, so no much.

01:09:43.323 --> 01:09:47.778
Bjorn, made the right
decision about this monk.

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:50.365
It is not so bad for a Christian.

01:09:55.379 --> 01:09:58.475
It would be faster if we jump to the ravine.

01:09:58.476 --> 01:10:00.185
Now go.

01:10:00.884 --> 01:10:02.262
Come on.

01:10:03.661 --> 01:10:05.359
Vikings.

01:10:08.515 --> 01:10:09.844
Vikings.

01:10:30.696 --> 01:10:32.008
Gunnar.

01:10:33.306 --> 01:10:34.703
Come on!

01:10:44.518 --> 01:10:46.016
Go east.

01:10:48.613 --> 01:10:50.361
Their lives end here!

01:11:28.569 --> 01:11:30.229
Lobo!

01:11:43.072 --> 01:11:45.303
Right there!

01:11:46.292 --> 01:11:49.108
Go to sleep with the dogs.

01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:55.113
- Gunnar, to the bridge.
- Yes!

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.089
Asbjørn.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:36.049
No!

01:12:37.588 --> 01:12:39.166
Grim!

01:12:44.105 --> 01:12:46.549
No!

01:13:12.281 --> 01:13:13.719
Gunnar!

01:13:23.739 --> 01:13:25.587
Tear down the bridge.

01:13:46.995 --> 01:13:49.382
This is just the beginning, Nordic.

01:14:03.267 --> 01:14:04.875
We need to continue.

01:14:10.919 --> 01:14:12.497
It should have been me.

01:14:15.444 --> 01:14:17.292
It should have been me.

01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:21.527
It was my time.

01:14:34.944 --> 01:14:38.619
Hjorr, come here.

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.138
There is a way.

01:15:07.279 --> 01:15:09.317
- Need to take that away.
- It's all right.

01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:13.332
Do you want to go to Dino or Valhalla?

01:15:30.554 --> 01:15:31.863
Hold On.

01:15:33.751 --> 01:15:35.049
What r u doing?

01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:45.739
To not become infected.

01:16:42.218 --> 01:16:43.857
Come on.

01:16:43.858 --> 01:16:45.611
If we continue in this step,

01:16:45.612 --> 01:16:48.033
we will still be here to Ragnarok.

01:16:52.538 --> 01:16:54.096
A coast.

01:16:55.725 --> 01:16:57.203
Not arrived yet.

01:17:00.339 --> 01:17:01.648
Wait.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.332
What do you see?

01:17:06.333 --> 01:17:08.910
I'm not sure.

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:10.899
Inghean,

01:17:11.228 --> 01:17:13.316
I believe what you see.

01:17:22.027 --> 01:17:23.495
What do you see?

01:17:27.171 --> 01:17:28.519
They are coming,

01:17:30.347 --> 01:17:31.976
the horse pack.

01:17:32.576 --> 01:17:35.462
Let's stand up and fight right here.

01:17:35.463 --> 01:17:37.450
This is not a good place to fight.

01:17:37.451 --> 01:17:40.756
- There must be another way.
- The boat is not far away,

01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:42.384
we can still get there.

01:17:42.385 --> 01:17:44.343
It is our only hope.

01:17:45.472 --> 01:17:46.970
and lets go.

01:17:47.569 --> 01:17:48.868
Come On.

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:09.636
The cliff is the tomb of them.

01:19:03.769 --> 01:19:05.438
No more running away.

01:19:08.404 --> 01:19:09.723
Here.

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:58.888
Vikings!

01:21:08.287 --> 01:21:09.686
Thorald wait.

01:21:10.834 --> 01:21:12.163
Thorald.

01:21:29.715 --> 01:21:31.353
Asbjørn!

01:22:20.850 --> 01:22:23.326
How many times we need to kill him, Nordic?

01:22:23.327 --> 01:22:25.985
At least once more time mercenary.

01:23:02.834 --> 01:23:05.000
No!

01:24:33.862 --> 01:24:35.167
Morra!

01:24:54.877 --> 01:24:58.813
You come with me, Nordic.

01:26:18.869 --> 01:26:20.407
I'm sorry.

01:26:32.274 --> 01:26:33.573
Thorald.

01:26:46.949 --> 01:26:50.115
When the storm raises fears

01:26:51.174 --> 01:26:53.492
lift the sail to the top.

01:26:53.871 --> 01:26:57.208
Like the King of Storm looks happy.

01:26:57.637 --> 01:26:59.785
Let browsing.

01:26:59.786 --> 01:27:01.784
Let the sail ...

01:27:02.563 --> 01:27:05.669
Best sink than hitting.

01:27:06.458 --> 01:27:08.975
For who hits

01:27:08.976 --> 01:27:11.203
is a slave.

01:27:43.409 --> 01:27:45.368
Follow your way.

01:28:11.869 --> 01:28:13.508
We arrived too late.

01:28:14.526 --> 01:28:17.623
The boats are in those caves.

01:28:19.261 --> 01:28:22.108
Entries are already under water.

01:28:28.391 --> 01:28:30.730
I'm not surprised.

01:28:53.675 --> 01:28:55.033
So what's the plan?

01:28:55.034 --> 01:28:57.721
No more talking, let's fight them.

01:29:21.944 --> 01:29:24.297
Tidak!

01:29:44.252 --> 01:29:46.469
We can stop them, come on.

01:29:46.979 --> 01:29:48.356
You will die in vain.

01:29:48.357 --> 01:29:51.114
No, I will die in battle.

01:29:57.877 --> 01:29:59.175
Look!

01:30:01.983 --> 01:30:04.121
Asbjørn!

01:30:13.021 --> 01:30:14.619
Now, my king?

01:30:15.428 --> 01:30:17.346
Archers.

01:30:20.453 --> 01:30:22.870
- Gunnar!
- I will fight!

01:30:25.828 --> 01:30:28.854
- Gunnar, we have the boat.
- No, I will fight!

01:30:46.165 --> 01:30:47.914
I thought we lost you.

01:30:50.252 --> 01:30:51.940
Asbjørn!

01:31:08.981 --> 01:31:11.829
Not bad, Not so bad.

01:31:12.808 --> 01:31:14.506
Hell is back.

01:31:18.195 --> 01:31:20.249
Let's get out of this coast.
