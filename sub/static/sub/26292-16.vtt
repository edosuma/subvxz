_

00:12.894 --> 00:16.306
_

00:16.308 --> 00:20.272
_

00:20.338 --> 00:21.939
- Max, snow day!
- Yeah.

00:21.973 --> 00:23.307
Heck yeah, snow day.

00:23.341 --> 00:24.975
I mean, technically it's snow evening,

00:25.010 --> 00:26.310
but that kinda
lacks poetry don't you think?

00:26.344 --> 00:27.706
- Sure.
- There's nothing quite like

00:27.740 --> 00:29.472
the sheer magic of the words, "snow day."

00:29.506 --> 00:30.514
- Yeah.
- Say it with me.

00:30.549 --> 00:32.249
Yeah, maybe later,
cause right now I gotta get

00:32.284 --> 00:34.418
this hospital ready for
the worst storm that we've seen

00:34.452 --> 00:35.920
in I don't know how many years.

00:35.954 --> 00:37.988
72 years. Yeah, it's a long time.

00:38.023 --> 00:40.524
But, uh, you know,
we had comparable snowfalls

00:40.559 --> 00:43.994
back in 2010 and 2016 but this
one's gonna be a lot more like

00:44.029 --> 00:46.931
- the great blizzard of 1947.
- Why do you know all this?

00:46.965 --> 00:48.599
Well, you know,
I have a passion for weather.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.301
Check this out. Look.
I put an anemometer on the roof

00:50.335 --> 00:51.468
seven years ago and
it remains the best decision

00:51.503 --> 00:53.270
I ever made in my life.

00:53.305 --> 00:54.939
Look. I mean, look at the
fluctuations in the storm.

00:54.973 --> 00:56.340
We can track it by its
geolocation, you know?

00:56.374 --> 00:58.442
Oh, God. She is all over the place.

00:58.476 --> 01:00.277
That explains why half the hospitals

01:00.312 --> 01:01.712
in this city have shut down.

01:01.746 --> 01:03.681
Uh, can y'all take those...
go to oncology.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.983
- Thank you.
- Private hospitals are wimps.

01:06.017 --> 01:07.618
Public hospitals don't get snow days.

01:07.652 --> 01:10.221
Laura, can we turn the heat up
two degrees? Two degrees.

01:10.255 --> 01:12.289
Thank you. I stocked up
on food, meds, supplies.

01:12.324 --> 01:13.557
I discharged every patient
I safely could,

01:13.592 --> 01:15.326
and I pared down to a skeleton crew.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.027
Well, what about you?
You going home to Georgia?

01:17.062 --> 01:19.129
I convinced her to go
to her parents' house,

01:19.164 --> 01:21.465
where she'll be enduring
a much more judgmental

01:21.499 --> 01:22.566
- type of storm.
- Oh yeah, I get ya.

01:22.601 --> 01:24.068
Yeah.

01:24.102 --> 01:26.136
Looks like you got this amigo.

01:26.171 --> 01:28.472
Oh, you know, this isn't so bad.

01:28.506 --> 01:30.574
This is nothing.
The great white out of 1888,

01:30.609 --> 01:32.209
they had to shut down Maine.

01:32.244 --> 01:33.477
Literally closed it
like it was a Denny's.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.012
Safety first.

01:35.046 --> 01:37.003
Well, 400 people still died that day.

01:39.017 --> 01:40.651
But we will be fine.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.152
Move it!

01:42.187 --> 01:44.054
Snow day, Dora!

01:44.089 --> 01:45.189
Snow day! Look it!

01:45.223 --> 01:46.523
No, I hear you.

01:46.558 --> 01:48.092
Look, I've got this cool weather app.

02:09.281 --> 02:12.016
Lauren, a patient overdosed in her room.

02:12.050 --> 02:13.350
Dr. Thomas got caught in the storm.

02:13.385 --> 02:15.552
What? Is she breathing or responsive?

02:15.587 --> 02:17.588
Respiratory rate's low
but she's oxygenating okay.

02:17.622 --> 02:20.457
- BP?
- 90/60, heart rate's 92.

02:22.093 --> 02:24.695
Okay, well, if she's oxygenating okay

02:24.729 --> 02:27.364
then she'll be fine until morning.

02:27.399 --> 02:29.733
Can't you help her?

02:29.768 --> 02:31.368
You're a doctor.

02:33.838 --> 02:37.374
I'm here because I'm not allowed
to be a doctor, remember?

02:38.642 --> 02:40.711
She is better off waiting
for doctor Thomas.

02:47.118 --> 02:49.553
One perfect Manhattan with a twist

02:49.587 --> 02:52.222
- or one Paloma with Mezcal?
- Both.

02:52.257 --> 02:54.758
How about one at a time?
Snows not going anywhere.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.168
- No.
<i>- I didn't even ask</i>

03:04.202 --> 03:05.769
<i>anything yet. But I know</i>

03:05.804 --> 03:07.604
- what you were going to ask.
<i>- No, that's impossible.</i>

03:07.639 --> 03:09.306
Go on, then. Ask.

03:09.341 --> 03:11.408
- I need you to come in.
<i>- No, see, I knew. No.</i>

03:11.443 --> 03:13.310
But it wasn't actually a question.

03:13.345 --> 03:15.279
This blizzard is gonna be bad and I need

03:15.313 --> 03:18.115
<i>my Deputy Medical Director here.</i>

03:18.149 --> 03:21.285
But she only just left.

03:21.319 --> 03:23.454
And she's about to get legless.

03:23.488 --> 03:25.356
<i>Legless?</i>

03:25.390 --> 03:27.358
Hammered. Sloshed. Sozzled.

03:27.392 --> 03:30.427
Great, so then I caught you just in time.

03:30.462 --> 03:32.096
I hate you.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.447
<i>What?</i>

03:34.632 --> 03:35.866
Hello?

03:35.900 --> 03:38.202
Hey? Sharpe?

03:38.236 --> 03:39.436
Max?

03:39.471 --> 03:42.039
How did you know?

03:42.741 --> 03:44.875
I could tell. You have to go back in?

03:44.909 --> 03:48.278
Unfortunately. I am his deputy.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.152
Turn in your badge, Deputy,

03:51.186 --> 03:53.517
and be an outlaw with me.

03:55.387 --> 03:58.288
But he is my boss.

03:58.323 --> 03:59.523
Mm-hmm.

03:59.557 --> 04:01.291
And your friend.

04:02.894 --> 04:05.629
Isn't it hard for him to see you

04:05.663 --> 04:07.164
as his doctor?

04:07.198 --> 04:09.649
You play so many other roles.

04:14.939 --> 04:18.142
Max is very respectful of my role

04:18.176 --> 04:19.642
as his doctor, thank you.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.644
I apologize. I would never question

04:21.678 --> 04:23.147
your effectiveness as a doctor.

04:23.181 --> 04:25.849
I just wondered if the, um,

04:25.884 --> 04:30.254
the thing you guys have
made it difficult.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.491
Excuse me, Max and I don't have a thing.

04:34.526 --> 04:36.226
The vibe?

04:36.261 --> 04:38.362
What are you talking about?
There is no vibe.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.865
Then how did I know
it was him on the phone?

04:46.538 --> 04:47.838
Maybe you're psychic.

04:50.442 --> 04:54.411
Just use my phone to call the kids.

04:54.446 --> 04:55.779
Why do you need yours?

04:55.814 --> 04:57.448
You know that they won't pick up now

04:57.482 --> 04:59.683
and then when you leave
I won't have a phone

04:59.717 --> 05:00.951
in case they call back.

05:00.985 --> 05:02.853
I will leave mine with you.

05:02.887 --> 05:04.588
What if they wanna talk to you?

05:04.622 --> 05:07.758
Chrissy, our Airbnb
is five full blocks away,

05:07.792 --> 05:09.760
I am exhausted.

05:09.794 --> 05:12.896
And it's snowing cats, dogs,

05:12.931 --> 05:15.298
and reindeer out there.

05:15.834 --> 05:18.302
It's good you got in
from Vermont when you did.

05:18.336 --> 05:19.736
See?

05:19.771 --> 05:22.940
No, sorry, I meant,
because we need to start

05:22.974 --> 05:25.609
Chrissy on an immune checkpoint
inhibitor tonight.

05:25.643 --> 05:27.377
It will make her glioblastoma

05:27.412 --> 05:29.746
respond better to her clinical trial.

05:29.781 --> 05:31.215
That sounds like something
I should probably

05:31.249 --> 05:33.016
tell the kids.

05:34.018 --> 05:35.586
Tell them.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.322
You sound exactly like me and my wife.

05:38.356 --> 05:40.891
Always arguing about silly things.

05:40.925 --> 05:43.827
I'm going back to our Airbnb
so I can get a few hours sleep.

05:43.862 --> 05:46.697
I will bring you your phone
in the morning.

05:49.334 --> 05:53.036
Shouldn't having cancer mean
I get to win every argument?

05:56.040 --> 05:58.091
Ugh.

05:58.843 --> 06:00.444
Hey, there's my deputy.
Wait, where's your hat?

06:01.646 --> 06:03.313
Oh, I forgot it because, you know,

06:03.348 --> 06:04.915
I was forced out of the warmth
quite suddenly.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.583
Yeah, but, uh, not wearing a hat

06:06.618 --> 06:08.519
in this weather is a little insane.

06:08.553 --> 06:10.320
Yeah, I'm your doctor, Max.
It's not the other way around.

06:10.355 --> 06:11.688
Hey, are you okay?

06:11.723 --> 06:13.457
Um.

06:16.361 --> 06:18.904
I'm fine, I just, um...

06:19.631 --> 06:22.432
I just had to walk four blocks
in a blizzard because

06:22.467 --> 06:24.301
my cab couldn't get past
this big accident

06:24.335 --> 06:25.869
- that's happened up the street...
- where?

06:25.904 --> 06:29.806
35th and 1st but there's no
casualties, just, uh,

06:29.841 --> 06:31.842
people thought they could drive in this.

06:31.876 --> 06:33.443
Wait, what is it?

06:33.478 --> 06:35.312
That's right in front of Station 27.

06:37.315 --> 06:38.645
I was just coming to find you.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.165
When's the last time
you got an ambulance in here?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.518
47 minutes ago.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.690
This is Max Goodwin at New Amsterdam.

06:46.724 --> 06:48.892
I need to talk to
EMS Division Chief Molinari.

06:48.927 --> 06:50.961
<i>- I'm on.
- What's going on out there?</i>

06:50.995 --> 06:53.363
<i>There's a huge pileup on 35th.</i>

06:53.398 --> 06:55.799
<i>Snow plows can't get through
to Murray Hill or Kips Bay.</i>

06:55.833 --> 06:57.034
Are calls coming in?

06:57.068 --> 06:58.635
<i>Many, but without snow plows</i>

06:58.670 --> 06:59.970
<i>our vehicles can't get to them.</i>

07:03.071 --> 07:04.708
Chief, send me a log of all
your incoming calls

07:04.742 --> 07:06.843
- and keep them coming.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

07:06.878 --> 07:08.579
If people can't get to this hospital,

07:08.613 --> 07:10.647
then we need to bring
this hospital to them.

07:17.717 --> 07:20.618
<i>I know being stuck in
the hospital during a blizzard</i>

07:20.652 --> 07:22.520
<i>sucks but do you know what's worse?</i>

07:22.554 --> 07:24.589
Needing 911 in a blizzard

07:24.623 --> 07:26.801
and being told that no one is coming.

07:26.836 --> 07:29.093
So I have here a list of 911 calls

07:29.127 --> 07:30.664
within a half mile of New Amsterdam.

07:30.699 --> 07:33.264
Ambulances can't get to them: We can.

07:33.298 --> 07:36.634
And yes, conditions are bad out
there, but we have got parkas,

07:36.668 --> 07:39.203
and we have got emergency packs,

07:39.238 --> 07:40.557
and we have got chutzpah.

07:40.592 --> 07:43.241
Everybody is gonna pair up for safety

07:43.275 --> 07:46.110
and we're gonna give you a GPS
locator so we can track you

07:46.144 --> 07:47.445
from right here in the hospital.

07:47.479 --> 07:50.114
And to be clear, nobody has to go.

07:50.148 --> 07:52.650
But we're there only shot, so...

07:52.684 --> 07:54.252
Any volunteers?

07:58.924 --> 08:01.158
Sweet. I've missed field medicine.

08:01.193 --> 08:02.260
I'll go with you.

08:02.294 --> 08:03.728
Casey and Flores, yes.

08:03.762 --> 08:05.997
You guys have a doorman
who's arm was sliced

08:06.031 --> 08:07.298
by a snow blower.

08:07.332 --> 08:09.767
1891 East 23rd street.

08:09.801 --> 08:12.003
Nottingham, Moreland,
you've got a college kid

08:12.037 --> 08:14.105
who OD'd. 32nd and 1st.

08:14.139 --> 08:15.339
Let's make sure we have Naloxone.

08:15.374 --> 08:17.742
Great, Levy Park we have
a man who has fallen down,

08:17.776 --> 08:18.743
can't move, may be unconscious.

08:18.777 --> 08:19.777
- On it.
- Thank you.

08:19.811 --> 08:22.313
- I'll go with you.
- And calls keep pouring in

08:22.347 --> 08:23.880
so just find your patient,

08:23.915 --> 08:25.650
treat them, and get back here
so we can send you

08:25.684 --> 08:27.251
right back out to treat the next person.

08:27.286 --> 08:30.285
And guys, let's be careful out there.

08:31.189 --> 08:33.455
Always wanted to say that.

08:37.796 --> 08:39.778
Hi, everybody. I'm here.

08:39.812 --> 08:42.799
Okay, raise your hand if you
find the storm scary right now.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.802
Big kids, I know it's not cool
to be scared

08:44.836 --> 08:46.671
but I bet the younger kids will
feel a lot better knowing

08:46.705 --> 08:48.310
they're not the only ones
who are spooked right now.

08:48.344 --> 08:49.530
So hands up. I got mine up.

08:49.564 --> 08:51.042
I'm scared.

08:51.076 --> 08:52.677
But guess what, guys. I have good news.

08:52.711 --> 08:55.046
We got games. We got games galore.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.181
We got hot cocoa and we got Gladys.

08:57.215 --> 08:58.616
How bad could it be
if we got Gladys, right?

08:58.650 --> 09:00.019
Everyone follow me. Come on.

09:00.019 --> 09:01.520
I'm gonna take you into the fun room.

09:01.554 --> 09:03.054
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:03.089 --> 09:04.623
And even though it's scary out there...

09:06.225 --> 09:08.360
Avi, that's not helpful.

09:08.394 --> 09:11.163
No, actually, it is kind of helpful, Avi.

09:11.197 --> 09:13.165
Thank you. Because, that freaked me out.

09:13.199 --> 09:14.566
Right? My heart jumped out of my chest.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.668
But now that I know it was just Avi,

09:16.702 --> 09:18.503
I don't have to be scared anymore. Right?

09:18.538 --> 09:19.863
Because the more you understand things,

09:19.897 --> 09:21.306
the less scary they are.

09:21.340 --> 09:24.209
Which brings me
to the star of this evening,

09:24.243 --> 09:26.253
the world's most comprehensive
and cool weather app.

09:26.287 --> 09:27.345
Look at this thing.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.647
We're gonna learn all about the storm

09:28.681 --> 09:31.049
through the majesty of satellite.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.652
Oh, skimbleshanks.

09:33.686 --> 09:35.921
My anemometer's not transmitting.

09:35.955 --> 09:39.191
Okay, uh... Okay, listen, Gladys,

09:39.225 --> 09:41.426
why don't you go in there,
break out le cocoa.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.395
Everybody, make me a mug, okay?

09:43.429 --> 09:45.597
Extra marshmallows for me,
and I will be right back.

09:45.631 --> 09:47.065
I promise.

09:47.099 --> 09:48.400
I'll be right back.

09:51.037 --> 09:52.704
Candelario, what you got?

09:53.739 --> 09:55.273
EMS just got a call.

09:55.308 --> 09:57.175
A man on East 21st street heard a crash

09:57.210 --> 09:59.010
in the adjacent apartment.
Older woman live there alone.

09:59.045 --> 10:00.445
There's been knocking but no answer.

10:00.479 --> 10:02.080
- No, no, I'll go.
- No, I think I should go.

10:02.114 --> 10:03.415
No, stay here,
track everyone in the field,

10:03.449 --> 10:05.116
and manage them when they get back.

10:07.119 --> 10:09.688
Whoa. Hang on, I thought
that you were staying here.

10:09.722 --> 10:13.124
Uh, older woman,
unresponsive, needs a doctor.

10:13.159 --> 10:16.027
Max, as your doctor I cannot let you

10:16.062 --> 10:17.295
traipse through a storm.

10:17.330 --> 10:18.730
Then come with me.

10:18.764 --> 10:21.613
Everyone needs a partner, be my partner.

10:25.471 --> 10:26.734
What?

10:28.140 --> 10:30.609
You have a compromised immune
system and you shouldn't...

10:30.643 --> 10:32.077
I'm not abandoning her.

10:37.350 --> 10:39.284
Mrs. Calloway suffered a massive MI.

10:39.318 --> 10:40.986
She's in cardiogenic shock.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.454
I will page Dr. Reynolds.

10:42.488 --> 10:44.990
There's nothing you can do.

10:45.024 --> 10:47.525
I'd be surprised if she lasts the night.

10:56.802 --> 10:58.737
I'm very sorry.

11:13.219 --> 11:15.020
Please tell me you're kidding.

11:15.054 --> 11:17.589
My patient is dying,
her husband needs to know

11:17.623 --> 11:19.162
what's happening.

11:19.525 --> 11:21.359
But can't you call him?

11:21.394 --> 11:23.428
His phone is here and he's
not answering her phone.

11:23.462 --> 11:25.130
Okay, but it's negative ten outside

11:25.164 --> 11:27.766
plus with the wind chill...
Vijay, you're not young.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.668
I don't want Chrissy
and Connor's last few words

11:29.702 --> 11:32.170
to be about some silly argument
about a cell phone.

11:32.204 --> 11:33.505
Okay, but, here. Take this.

11:33.539 --> 11:35.106
So I can keep track of you.

11:49.355 --> 11:50.455
Mrs. Gallagher?

11:50.489 --> 11:52.357
There she is.

11:55.161 --> 11:57.629
- I can't feel a pulse.
- I got you.

11:57.663 --> 11:58.797
Starting compressions.

12:00.399 --> 12:01.800
Clear.

12:03.736 --> 12:06.371
I don't feel a pulse. Going again.

12:06.405 --> 12:07.806
Clear.

12:09.842 --> 12:11.376
I got a pulse.

12:11.410 --> 12:12.644
She's back.

12:18.617 --> 12:20.452
Have you seen our guy?

12:21.721 --> 12:23.555
I can barely see you!

12:25.458 --> 12:26.725
What's that?

12:28.527 --> 12:30.762
Oh, God. That's him!

12:37.737 --> 12:39.537
Sir, can you hear me?

12:42.375 --> 12:44.175
Equal round, reactive to light.

12:44.210 --> 12:45.510
His heart rate's around 30.

12:45.544 --> 12:47.412
Cold weather really slowed him down.

12:47.446 --> 12:49.514
- I can't move.
- It's okay.

12:49.548 --> 12:50.582
You fell and hit your head.

12:50.616 --> 12:52.517
- What's your name?
- Hugh.

12:52.551 --> 12:54.085
Torone.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.354
I'm Dr. Reynolds, this is Dr. Jessup.

12:56.389 --> 12:58.890
We're from New Amsterdam.
We're here to help you.

12:58.924 --> 13:00.888
Go help my husband.

13:01.293 --> 13:03.294
Your husband?

13:03.329 --> 13:05.196
I was running home from the pharmacy

13:05.231 --> 13:06.978
when I slipped and fell.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.601
His glucose

13:09.635 --> 13:13.405
was monitoring 475 when I left.

13:15.307 --> 13:16.808
Mr. Torone, where do you live?

13:16.842 --> 13:19.611
Oh, just a few blocks from here on 29th.

13:19.645 --> 13:21.446
464.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.648
Apartment 1043.

13:23.682 --> 13:25.383
Okay, and the prescription?

13:25.418 --> 13:27.385
Oh, it's in my left pocket.

13:27.420 --> 13:28.875
Got it.

13:29.822 --> 13:35.627
Run! 29th, 464. Apartment 1043.

13:35.661 --> 13:37.762
Don't worry, I got you, all right?

13:37.797 --> 13:39.226
You're gonna be all right.

14:00.386 --> 14:02.454
<i>Jessup!</i>

14:03.689 --> 14:05.790
<i>Jessup!</i>

14:12.565 --> 14:14.833
You really shouldn't
have come all this way.

14:14.867 --> 14:16.801
Unfortunately, Marlene,

14:16.836 --> 14:19.067
no ambulances can get through
the snow right now.

14:19.101 --> 14:21.372
Please, don't waste your time with me,

14:21.407 --> 14:22.507
Her blood pressure is dropping.

14:22.541 --> 14:23.842
We're gonna need Levophed.

14:23.876 --> 14:25.640
- That's back at the hospital.
- Yeah.

14:28.380 --> 14:31.316
Um, I'll go.

14:31.350 --> 14:32.717
- No, I will.
- No, I got it.

14:32.751 --> 14:34.686
- I'll be really fast.
- You're not supposed

14:34.720 --> 14:36.521
to be fast, you're supposed
to be taking it slowly!

14:36.555 --> 14:38.223
I came to keep an eye on you

14:38.257 --> 14:39.891
but it doesn't matter
because the only doctor

14:39.925 --> 14:41.793
you listen to is yourself.

14:43.496 --> 14:45.497
I am going to the hospital,
you are staying here,

14:45.531 --> 14:48.366
end of story. Excuse me, please.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.701
Ugh...

14:51.036 --> 14:53.004
Okay...

14:54.273 --> 14:55.795
She's, um...

14:56.242 --> 14:58.376
very good at what she does.

14:58.410 --> 15:02.547
She's, uh... uh,
Dr. Sharpe will be right back.

15:02.581 --> 15:05.388
Thank you, but it really doesn't matter.

15:06.585 --> 15:07.852
You're gonna be fine.

15:07.887 --> 15:10.555
No, I won't. I'm a clairvoyant.

15:10.589 --> 15:12.423
I've seen the future.

15:12.458 --> 15:15.460
Today's the day I'm going to die.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.287
Oh...

15:40.786 --> 15:42.520
All right, come on.

15:42.555 --> 15:43.755
I can do this.

15:43.789 --> 15:47.025
Wisconsin Strong. Let's go, Iggy.

15:47.059 --> 15:48.598
There you go.

15:55.768 --> 16:00.605
Oh!

16:19.925 --> 16:22.760
Hey! Hello?

16:27.855 --> 16:29.855
<i>Heart rate's down to 48 and weak.</i>

16:29.889 --> 16:31.190
<i>I can barely feel it.</i>

16:31.224 --> 16:33.392
She stopped breathing on her own.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.327
O-2 sat down to 89%.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.895
Grab the Ambu bag.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.704
O-2 sats still in the 80's.

16:45.739 --> 16:47.339
I'm gonna tilt her head back
to get a better seal.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.041
She's going to aspirate.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.045
Move.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.247
Turn her on her side.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.882
Keep working the bag.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.350
One,

16:58.385 --> 17:00.219
two,

17:00.253 --> 17:01.820
three.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.992
Okay.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.002
Just give it a minute.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.108
There you go.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.214
Get a message to Dr. Thomas.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.416
She's gonna need to bring charcoal.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.384
Got it. Thank you, Lauren.

17:48.968 --> 17:52.971
Mr. Torone, you need to stay
absolutely still.

17:53.006 --> 17:55.307
Can't you just pull me off of it?

17:55.342 --> 17:58.477
No, not without risking
injury to other organs.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.461
I gotta find a way to get you
to the hospital

18:00.495 --> 18:02.781
without removing you from the spike.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.117
How do you know it didn't hit my heart?

18:05.151 --> 18:07.786
Because we wouldn't be having
this conversation, Mr. Torone.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.321
Feels like you're about to become

18:09.356 --> 18:11.390
an important person in my life.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.459
Just call me Hugh.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.854
All right, Hugh.

18:14.889 --> 18:16.328
Right now I'm just trying to
figure out exactly how

18:16.363 --> 18:18.130
this spike is penetrating you.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.566
Well, it definitely
doesn't feel like missionary.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.901
Oh, God.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.403
Apologies.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.438
Eric says I should know people
a little better

18:26.473 --> 18:28.073
before I make those kinds of jokes.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.577
Lift up a little.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.279
Oh, thank you.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.148
I'm not cold.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.119
You're not?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.500
Oh.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.868
Hey.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.370
You were asleep. You feel okay?

18:58.405 --> 19:00.272
Oh.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.374
I thought maybe I was dead.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.511
No, Marlene. You are not gonna die today.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.513
Not on my watch. Let's sit you up.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.181
What do you know?

19:09.215 --> 19:12.351
You're a doctor, you believe in science.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.619
Facts.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.187
The known.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.156
Well, yeah. Me and, uh,

19:17.190 --> 19:18.682
most other people.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.227
I believe in the hidden.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.229
I believe there's a deeper
spiritual reality

19:24.264 --> 19:26.465
that extends beyond pure reason.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.333
Mm, and while that's fascinating,

19:28.368 --> 19:29.985
it doesn't have to kill you.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.874
Why don't we ask the cards?

19:35.909 --> 19:37.409
Split the deck.

19:37.444 --> 19:41.346
And show me the top card
of the bottom half.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.999
Uh...

19:45.185 --> 19:47.253
Yeah, okay. Okay.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.191
Ask the cards.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.386
Here we go, split these.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.198
What do you... what do you see?

19:59.232 --> 20:02.167
- King of swords.
- Mm.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.020
Reversed.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.173
A very powerful card.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.276
But one to be wary of.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.321
Hm. You help people,

20:14.647 --> 20:17.533
sometimes at a detriment to yourself.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.153
Yes, because I'm a doctor.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.748
I see a woman.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.795
But there have been some bumps recently.

20:33.967 --> 20:37.536
Okay, that's true but, uh...

20:37.970 --> 20:39.605
That's every marriage.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.850
You try to meet her needs,

20:43.476 --> 20:47.179
but sometimes it's just not enough.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.616
You're going to lose her.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.443
Yeah, okay. Um...

20:53.086 --> 20:57.072
Why don't you try
to get some rest, Marlene?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.413
Look, uh...

21:05.031 --> 21:07.166
My wife and I have, uh...

21:08.134 --> 21:10.969
been through a lot this year,
but we're good.

21:11.004 --> 21:12.963
Now. So...

21:13.606 --> 21:15.340
I'm not gonna lose her.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.676
I'm not talking about your wife.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.846
You and your wife are fine.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.749
There's someone else.

21:26.519 --> 21:31.106
Someone you care for deeply.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.569
And you are going to lose her.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.024
Hang in there, Hugh.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.535
How you holding up?

22:16.569 --> 22:19.204
You know, stabbed.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.825
Found it!

22:26.379 --> 22:28.547
There's a screw attached to the spike.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.650
If I could just loosen it
I could remove you

22:31.684 --> 22:32.851
and the spike together.

22:32.885 --> 22:35.253
Oh, like a couple.

22:35.288 --> 22:38.223
Oh, sorry. Even with pain killers

22:38.257 --> 22:40.192
you're gonna feel some stuff.

22:40.226 --> 22:42.177
Oh, stop!

22:45.398 --> 22:47.432
Nope.

22:47.467 --> 22:51.169
No, no. I'm sorry.
Keep going, keep going.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.438
Why don't you tell me about Eric?

22:53.473 --> 22:55.240
What's he like?

22:56.109 --> 22:58.377
We've been married for six years.

22:59.379 --> 23:02.197
Together since 1987.

23:03.383 --> 23:08.120
Eric is smart and funny.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.888
Oh yeah?

23:12.659 --> 23:14.251
So loving.

23:14.727 --> 23:18.130
He's also the world's best
procrastinator.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.199
He promised he would refill his insulin

23:21.234 --> 23:23.260
two days ago.

23:24.237 --> 23:27.205
I should have just done it for him.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.774
Look where that literally landed me.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.445
Yeah, my mom forgets to do things.

23:33.479 --> 23:35.614
Simple things, you know?

23:35.648 --> 23:38.617
Like I told her before the storm hit

23:38.651 --> 23:41.653
to go to my sister's and she forgot.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.199
But she's old, you know.
It's not her fault.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.785
I still get mad at her.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.629
I don't even know why.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.873
Maybe you're scared

23:53.332 --> 23:57.544
that she's starting to decline.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.608
I don't know, I never really
talked to anyone about it.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.814
No!

24:09.982 --> 24:11.616
Damn thing broke.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.257
You have to leave me now, don't you?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.488
No.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.631
You're coming with me.

24:28.468 --> 24:32.170
I thought that wasn't an option.

24:32.205 --> 24:33.956
Now it's our only option.

24:34.507 --> 24:37.943
If you pull me off, won't I die?

24:39.712 --> 24:43.515
If we stay here, you definitely will.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.263
Hey!

24:50.288 --> 24:51.589
Hey!

24:54.560 --> 24:58.330
Hello! Hello!

24:58.364 --> 25:00.799
I fully recognize
that I'm probably yelling

25:00.833 --> 25:02.467
at nobody right now,

25:02.502 --> 25:04.402
but if you can hear me,
I'm up on the roof

25:04.437 --> 25:06.471
and I would rather not die of exposure.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.873
Thank you!

25:08.908 --> 25:10.542
Whoa, hey, hey.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.978
Don't let that door shut.
Don't let the door shut!

25:13.012 --> 25:14.479
Damnit.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.501
Avi?

25:20.620 --> 25:21.962
Avi!

25:22.889 --> 25:24.523
Avi!

25:24.557 --> 25:27.692
Hey, Avi!

25:27.727 --> 25:29.227
Avi!

25:35.278 --> 25:38.312
<i>Okay, Marlene, this should
be making you feel better.</i>

25:38.346 --> 25:41.315
<i>It doesn't, but that's
because I'm gonna be dead.</i>

25:41.349 --> 25:43.584
Marlene, what did we say about that?

25:43.618 --> 25:46.687
- Mm.
- Hey, can I, uh...

25:46.721 --> 25:49.523
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

25:52.561 --> 25:54.462
Look, I know that we can't leave her,

25:54.496 --> 25:56.497
but Candelario really needs us
back at the hospital.

25:56.531 --> 25:58.499
Hang on. Um...

26:04.379 --> 26:06.740
I know that I haven't always been, um...

26:13.138 --> 26:15.449
You've been so, uh...

26:15.933 --> 26:17.809
you've always, uh...

26:22.731 --> 26:24.825
Never mind. I forgot.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.393
Yeah, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

26:26.428 --> 26:28.871
Yeah, no, sorry. I forgot. It's just, um,

26:28.896 --> 26:31.916
chemo brain strikes again, so, yeah.

26:31.951 --> 26:33.967
I know that we need to get back
to the hospital

26:34.001 --> 26:36.136
but we really need to monitor Marlene.

26:36.170 --> 26:38.238
Mm. Um, yeah.

26:38.272 --> 26:40.140
Telemetry.

26:40.174 --> 26:41.808
Uh, we could get the equipment

26:41.843 --> 26:44.461
from New Amsterdam
and monitor her from here.

26:45.179 --> 26:48.215
Telemetry. Helen, you are the best.

26:48.249 --> 26:49.850
Hm.

26:49.884 --> 26:52.052
I think that's kinda what

26:52.086 --> 26:53.920
I was trying to...

26:53.955 --> 26:55.288
tell you.

26:57.258 --> 26:59.192
Um,

26:59.227 --> 27:01.761
Marlene, Dr. Sharpe has saved the day.

27:01.796 --> 27:03.663
We are going to monitor you
remotely from New Amsterdam.

27:03.698 --> 27:06.600
I will be right back. No, no, no.

27:06.634 --> 27:08.268
No, no, no. You look
wiped out from your last trip.

27:08.302 --> 27:10.237
You stay, I'm gonna get
the equipment this time,

27:10.271 --> 27:12.706
but I am gonna go slow,

27:12.740 --> 27:14.274
and I will take care of myself.

27:14.866 --> 27:17.010
Because I love my doctor.

27:29.891 --> 27:32.592
Have the two of you been working together

27:32.627 --> 27:34.303
for a long time?

27:35.563 --> 27:38.198
No. Why?

27:38.640 --> 27:41.601
I just sense a very strong vibe.

27:47.275 --> 27:49.526
Okay.

27:53.314 --> 27:57.050
Honey, I'm sorry,
but it's never gonna work out

27:57.084 --> 27:59.119
between you and Max.

28:10.264 --> 28:14.134
I don't need it to work out
between me and Max.

28:15.369 --> 28:19.139
Max is married, I have a boyfriend.

28:19.173 --> 28:21.808
And most importantly, I am his doctor.

28:30.985 --> 28:32.786
How you doing, Avi?

28:34.388 --> 28:36.212
I don't want to talk about it.

28:40.294 --> 28:42.295
Storms, man.

28:42.330 --> 28:44.597
It's just pressure and precipitation

28:44.632 --> 28:46.917
but, man, they make
us feel stuff, don't they?

28:47.668 --> 28:49.920
Riddled with the feels right now.

28:50.738 --> 28:52.172
What about you?

28:52.907 --> 28:54.374
How's the storm make you feel?

28:56.911 --> 29:00.113
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

29:00.147 --> 29:01.948
Why'd you kick that door earlier?

29:01.983 --> 29:03.817
Let's start there.

29:05.152 --> 29:06.786
I was just being stupid.

29:06.821 --> 29:11.024
No, no, no. I mean,
it wasn't nice but, stupid?

29:11.058 --> 29:12.792
Nah, I don't think so.

29:12.827 --> 29:14.294
In fact, I think it may have
gotten you exactly what

29:14.328 --> 29:16.129
you needed, am I right?

29:16.163 --> 29:17.797
Come on, level with me.

29:17.832 --> 29:19.632
What were you thinking
when you kicked the door?

29:30.077 --> 29:33.313
That no one cared that I was there, okay?

29:33.347 --> 29:35.849
That's a tough way to feel, no doubt.

29:35.883 --> 29:38.918
So what were you thinking?
Why'd you come up here?

29:38.953 --> 29:40.929
What was this all about?

29:44.191 --> 29:45.658
Everyone was just playing games

29:45.693 --> 29:47.260
and watching movies, you know.

29:47.294 --> 29:49.662
And I was...

29:49.697 --> 29:51.831
I just left the classroom
to see if anyone would notice

29:51.866 --> 29:54.234
and be, like, you know, "Where is Avi?"

29:54.268 --> 29:57.404
But, you know, no one did.

29:57.438 --> 30:01.107
So I just kept going
and waiting for someone

30:01.142 --> 30:04.244
to freakin' notice that I wasn't there.

30:04.278 --> 30:05.745
But...

30:06.380 --> 30:10.116
No one did and when I got
all the way out the door,

30:10.151 --> 30:12.218
that's when I started thinking,

30:12.684 --> 30:14.087
would anyone notice if I was...

30:20.227 --> 30:22.228
There are people
that wouldn't just notice

30:22.263 --> 30:24.164
if you were gone, Avi.

30:25.399 --> 30:27.809
There are people
that will be heartbroken.

30:28.969 --> 30:31.354
You're talking to one of them right now.

30:33.808 --> 30:35.609
We are not alone.

30:37.178 --> 30:38.778
Avi.

30:39.413 --> 30:42.115
Even when it feels that way
the most, I promise you,

30:42.149 --> 30:44.084
we are not alone.

30:44.118 --> 30:46.219
I'm really cold.

30:46.253 --> 30:49.164
- I know. I know you are.
- I'm cold.

30:51.258 --> 30:53.460
Here, here, here.

30:56.530 --> 30:58.590
Okay?

32:29.591 --> 32:32.193
Loaded you up with morphine.

32:32.227 --> 32:35.396
The hospital is about six blocks away.

32:35.430 --> 32:37.164
Here's what we're going to do.

32:38.266 --> 32:39.867
We're gonna go on three.

32:39.901 --> 32:41.693
All right?

32:52.147 --> 32:54.048
Wait, wait a minute.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.185
If I don't make it, you...

32:58.220 --> 33:01.555
You tell Eric it isn't his fault.

33:04.292 --> 33:08.261
I would have ventured out
into a million storms for him.

33:11.681 --> 33:13.534
Okay?

33:13.568 --> 33:15.544
All right. You stay with me.

33:15.578 --> 33:17.104
Just look at me, okay?

33:17.138 --> 33:18.405
All right, I got you.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.441
All right, here we go.

33:20.982 --> 33:22.400
One...

33:23.411 --> 33:25.279
two...

33:25.313 --> 33:28.916
three.

33:28.950 --> 33:31.051
Ahh!

33:45.433 --> 33:47.268
Okay.

33:52.445 --> 33:54.456
<i>Marlene, we're going to be
monitoring you remotely,</i>

33:54.491 --> 33:56.336
<i>so if anything happens we'll
be able</i> to get you quickly.

33:56.343 --> 33:58.048
Yeah. And as soon as the roads are clear

33:58.073 --> 33:59.552
we're gonna send an ambulance for you.

34:00.146 --> 34:01.241
Marlene?

34:02.857 --> 34:04.347
Marlene, are you feeling okay?

34:04.859 --> 34:06.149
I... I'm fine.

34:06.184 --> 34:08.780
See? What did we tell you?

34:11.080 --> 34:13.623
But I really thought

34:13.658 --> 34:16.099
I was going to die today.

34:16.134 --> 34:18.306
Well, we're very sorry to disappoint you.

34:18.333 --> 34:22.210
It's okay, but I should
probably tell you both,

34:22.871 --> 34:25.239
since I was wrong about dying,

34:25.273 --> 34:28.475
maybe I was wrong
about my other predictions.

34:29.878 --> 34:32.011
I guess time will tell.

34:40.855 --> 34:43.898
Uh, the roads will be clear soon.

34:52.995 --> 34:55.463
Get me a gurney!

34:55.487 --> 34:56.995
We've got a bleeder.

34:59.408 --> 35:00.541
Get me to the OR!

35:04.746 --> 35:06.380
Dr. Frome!

35:06.415 --> 35:07.882
Gladys! Hi!

35:07.916 --> 35:09.850
Oh, God!

35:09.885 --> 35:11.852
I assumed you were doing
something important

35:11.887 --> 35:13.454
then of course I realized

35:13.488 --> 35:16.424
you just had to fix
your ridiculous gizmo.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.859
Oh, thank you.

35:18.894 --> 35:20.694
Thank you.

35:20.729 --> 35:22.897
Let's get you boys some cocoa.

35:22.931 --> 35:24.932
Think I might need something
a little stronger than that.

35:24.966 --> 35:26.983
Oh, boy.

35:38.013 --> 35:39.413
Just be with her.

35:41.016 --> 35:42.750
Tell her what she means to you.

35:57.699 --> 35:59.600
Chrissy...

35:59.634 --> 36:01.936
I'm here.

36:01.970 --> 36:03.853
I'm here, sweetie.

36:05.340 --> 36:07.649
Chrissy, my love.

36:09.511 --> 36:11.194
My love.

36:12.426 --> 36:13.894
I'm here.

36:17.385 --> 36:18.701
Lauren?

36:35.837 --> 36:37.470
Did you take any?

36:38.006 --> 36:41.742
No, but I really, really wanted to.

36:44.679 --> 36:46.714
I'm never gonna be a doctor again.

36:55.524 --> 36:57.725
I can counsel people.

36:57.759 --> 37:01.529
I can support them,
but the one thing that

37:01.563 --> 37:04.865
I can't do for anyone is make
them want to get better.

37:05.834 --> 37:07.401
And the only way you get better

37:07.435 --> 37:10.638
is if you really, truly, want it.

37:21.449 --> 37:23.417
I know you want it.

37:27.889 --> 37:29.480
I do.

37:30.725 --> 37:32.442
I really do.

37:40.735 --> 37:42.570
Oh, man.

37:49.044 --> 37:51.178
Sorry, I can't.

37:52.747 --> 37:54.589
You were right.

37:56.418 --> 37:58.468
I am tired.

38:01.890 --> 38:04.641
Okay. It's okay.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.929
That's why I'm here.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.900
Maybe...

38:16.504 --> 38:18.821
Maybe I should listen to you more often.

38:20.475 --> 38:22.950
Okay, just lean on me.

38:23.812 --> 38:25.546
Come on.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.629
Vijay, my friend.

38:41.663 --> 38:43.163
Hey.

38:43.198 --> 38:44.965
Heard about what you did. That was, um...

38:45.000 --> 38:46.808
They were fighting.

38:48.036 --> 38:51.312
It made me think of the night
my wife passed.

38:52.974 --> 38:54.385
She had made...

38:55.383 --> 38:58.018
bhindi sabzi for dinner.

38:59.981 --> 39:01.982
We were about to watch her

39:02.017 --> 39:04.785
favorite soap opera.

39:06.721 --> 39:08.989
Instead we fought because...

39:10.558 --> 39:13.661
Rohan had not come back home
and she was worried.

39:15.063 --> 39:17.296
I told her not to be because

39:18.214 --> 39:19.966
Rohan was a...

39:20.835 --> 39:23.003
lost cause.

39:24.539 --> 39:27.640
We both went to bed...

39:28.543 --> 39:29.934
angry.

39:33.214 --> 39:35.231
And then she didn't wake up.

39:37.686 --> 39:39.861
All these years, I thought that

39:40.855 --> 39:44.740
I was hurting because I didn't
get to tell her I'm...

39:46.194 --> 39:47.785
I'm sorry.

39:53.234 --> 39:55.668
But now I know it's because

39:57.205 --> 39:59.422
I didn't get to tell her that...

40:02.842 --> 40:04.886
I loved her smile.

40:08.016 --> 40:09.557
Her mischief.

40:13.621 --> 40:14.979
Her heart.

40:21.903 --> 40:23.864
Let's get you upstairs
so you can lie down.

40:23.898 --> 40:25.281
Yeah.

40:25.734 --> 40:27.283
It'll be...

40:28.069 --> 40:29.703
Right here's fine.

40:29.738 --> 40:31.078
Max?

40:32.240 --> 40:33.574
Are you feeling okay?

40:33.608 --> 40:37.126
Yeah, I'm just...

40:38.079 --> 40:40.087
Just tired.

40:45.587 --> 40:46.886
Yeah.

40:47.989 --> 40:50.691
Well, it's almost midnight.

40:53.161 --> 40:55.269
The witching hour.

40:58.099 --> 41:00.234
Do you believe in

41:00.268 --> 41:02.235
all that stuff?

41:10.845 --> 41:12.620
I don't know.

41:15.750 --> 41:17.291
Do you?

41:17.952 --> 41:19.585
Um...

41:21.356 --> 41:23.090
I don't know either.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.515
Max?

41:37.205 --> 41:38.980
We need to talk.

41:41.899 --> 41:43.777
About us.

41:49.217 --> 41:50.700
Okay.

41:52.887 --> 41:56.757
This thing between us...

42:02.330 --> 42:03.964
Get this jacket off of me.
