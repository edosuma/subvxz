01:21.250 --> 01:25.150
This is how war begins.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.720
Athens and Sparta
fought during a plague

01:28.720 --> 01:30.720
which wiped out
much of the population.

01:30.730 --> 01:32.990
Sound familiar?

01:33.000 --> 01:36.530
But the war brought
only more death and destruction

01:36.530 --> 01:39.730
because people let their fear,
their honor, their interest

01:39.730 --> 01:41.330
cloud their judgment.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.540
The Peloponnesian War
may be ancient history,

01:45.540 --> 01:47.780
but its lessons are not.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.880
You here will be the first
graduating class of midshipmen

01:52.880 --> 01:54.480
to enter the Navy

01:54.480 --> 01:56.220
since our own troubles ended
just three years ago.

01:56.220 --> 02:01.350
We're in a time of peace,
but peace doesn't keep itself.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.690
Ours is a small navy,
which means...

02:04.690 --> 02:08.830
your importance to the mission
is even larger.

02:08.830 --> 02:10.560
And you will take
the lessons from history,

02:10.570 --> 02:15.640
both ancient and very recent,
with you as you enter service.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.910
When you put on the uniform,
you can't let your fear

02:19.910 --> 02:22.840
or your pride
or your selfish interest

02:22.850 --> 02:25.250
lead you astray, or people die.

02:25.250 --> 02:29.520
We have to think differently
because we <i> are</i> different.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.250
We are warriors.

02:33.260 --> 02:35.590
All right, we'll pick it up
after the weekend.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.990
Don't forget your reading.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.330
We're all working
from the same edition,

02:39.330 --> 02:41.330
thanks to our friends
at the Nimitz Library.

02:41.330 --> 02:43.530
We'll discuss the first 100 pages.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.000
Don't worry,
there's lots of pictures.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.970
Attention on deck.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.680
Dismissed.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.410
See you on Monday,
enjoy the big game, go Navy!

02:59.810 --> 03:02.420
Mr. Swain?
Yes, sir.

03:02.420 --> 03:05.490
How is it my brightest student

03:05.490 --> 03:08.960
is always the last one
to turn in his assignments?

03:08.960 --> 03:12.030
Sir, I had a last-minute breakthrough.
I wanted to check my numbers.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.360
I'm sorry, sir.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.160
No excuse.

03:18.170 --> 03:21.100
"The Next Virus Will Be Cyber".

03:21.100 --> 03:22.970
I thought I was done
with viruses.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.440
I hope we are, sir.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.170
Well, I'm docking you one grade
for lateness,

03:26.180 --> 03:27.640
but this is excellent work.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.040
And if you don't mind,

03:29.040 --> 03:30.980
I'd like to hang on to it
for a little bit.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.180
There's some folks at Fleet Command
who'd be interested in your research.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.380
I'd like to share it with them,
with your permission.

03:35.380 --> 03:36.450
Yeah.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.990
Yes, sir. Of course.

03:41.860 --> 03:45.460
Um...

03:45.460 --> 03:49.200
Do you miss it, sir?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.400
Miss what?

03:51.400 --> 03:54.540
War, sir.

03:54.540 --> 03:58.210
Son, you really ought to
get to my class more often.

03:58.210 --> 04:01.880
I just mean, you retired,
and that's cool and all.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.210
But...

04:03.210 --> 04:05.280
don't you miss the mission?

04:05.280 --> 04:07.550
Clarity of purpose?

04:07.550 --> 04:11.350
I mean, you said it yourself...
We're warriors.

04:11.350 --> 04:16.690
Without a war,
what's a warrior to do?

04:19.829 --> 04:22.560
Thank you, sir.

05:31.570 --> 05:34.030
<i>Sí.</i> No problem,<i> señor.</i>

05:34.040 --> 05:35.840
I smuggle blue cure into Panama

05:35.840 --> 05:37.240
two weeks before
the ship showed up.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.970
This?

05:38.970 --> 05:40.570
This was easy.

05:40.580 --> 05:43.040
"You are cordially invited
to the 50th birthday celebration

05:43.050 --> 05:45.510
of <i> El Presidente</i>
Fernando Asturius.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.350
Black tie preferred."

05:49.050 --> 05:51.120
You know, it seems odd
<i>El Presidente</i>

05:51.120 --> 05:52.250
throws a blow-out party

05:52.250 --> 05:54.220
while the people curse him
in the street.

05:55.060 --> 05:56.790
That's Panama.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.930
<i>El Presidente</i> isn't afraid
of Gustavo Barros

05:58.930 --> 06:00.460
or his Gran Colombian goons.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.730
Whoever controls
the Panama Canal...

06:02.730 --> 06:04.060
is king.

06:04.070 --> 06:06.070
And for now,
that man is <i> El Presidente.</i>

06:06.070 --> 06:08.800
Well, killing <i> El Presidente</i>
would change all that.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.270
You guys are crazy.

06:12.340 --> 06:15.210
What are you,
Defense Intelligence?

06:15.210 --> 06:16.340
CIA?

06:16.350 --> 06:20.550
Yeah, you guys are crazy.

06:22.150 --> 06:25.620
<i>Adiós,</i> Marco.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.230
I got to go!

06:39.230 --> 06:41.430
No, I'm going through security.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.840
I'll see you tonight.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.300
I will do the cooking.

06:44.310 --> 06:46.840
You're the best
ever, ever, ever.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.380
And the cutest and the sweetest
and the smartest...

06:50.380 --> 06:52.450
I got to go!
W-W-Wait!

06:52.450 --> 06:53.850
I'm sending you
something super important.

06:53.850 --> 06:55.120
Hang on!
Okay.

07:07.130 --> 07:09.660
Did you get it?

07:09.660 --> 07:11.200
I got it.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.130
Now you have it.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.940
You're so weird.
I love you.

07:14.940 --> 07:17.400
I love you.
Bye.

07:17.410 --> 07:20.670
Bye.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.160
Commander Granderson?

07:37.160 --> 07:39.090
Yes, sir.
You're right on time.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.160
Put it up on the big screens.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.040
They made it.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.240
Almost here.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.710
The great fleet.

07:57.910 --> 08:02.050
USS <i> Michener,</i>
this is fleet command.

08:02.050 --> 08:03.250
Come in, over.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.790
<i>This is Zulu Actual.</i>

08:04.790 --> 08:07.450
<i>It is another beautiful day
at sea.</i>

08:07.460 --> 08:09.260
<i>As I'm sure
you've been watching,</i>

08:09.260 --> 08:11.790
<i>we're currently 200 miles north
of naval station Mayport.</i>

08:11.790 --> 08:14.260
Should be in port
and all tucked in by nightfall.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.060
Ships in the fleet,

08:16.060 --> 08:19.270
why don't you give our friends
in Florida a proper Navy hello?

08:19.270 --> 08:21.670
This is USS <i> Jeffrey Michener</i>
actual.

08:21.670 --> 08:22.740
All systems go.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.400
We have on board
a full complement

08:24.410 --> 08:26.070
of surface warriors, aviators,

08:26.070 --> 08:28.810
<i>and more Marines
than you can shake a stick at.</i>

08:28.810 --> 08:31.880
<i>- Over.</i>
<i>- This is USS</i> Oliver <i> actual.</i>

08:31.880 --> 08:33.280
<i>All systems are go.</i>

08:33.280 --> 08:35.150
<i>This is</i>
Michael O'Connor <i> actual.</i>

08:35.150 --> 08:36.679
<i>All systems go.</i>

08:36.690 --> 08:38.289
<i>This is the</i> Javier Cruz <i> actual.</i>

08:38.289 --> 08:39.490
<i>Smooth sailing.</i>

08:39.490 --> 08:41.419
Good day, fleet command.

08:41.419 --> 08:44.490
This is <i> Nathan James</i> actual.
All systems go.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.890
We are ready and proud

08:45.890 --> 08:47.960
to no longer be
the only ship in the fleet.

08:50.570 --> 08:53.370
Ships of the fleet,
your route is clear.

08:53.370 --> 08:56.170
We wish you fair winds
and following seas.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.240
Much obliged, Master Chief.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.570
It's a great day for the Navy

09:00.580 --> 09:03.040
and the red, white, and blue.

09:03.050 --> 09:05.780
This is Zulu actual out.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.320
We're up a touchdown,
but it's early.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.260
Take nothing for granted.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.860
Army's got a ground game for once.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.730
What time's your flight?
Couple hours.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.800
You pack your whites?

09:23.800 --> 09:26.300
It's hot in Florida,
even in December.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.400
Sam moved out, Sasha.

09:30.410 --> 09:33.740
He wants to live with Ashley
in St. Louis.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.080
I know.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.340
I spoke with Ashley last week.

09:37.350 --> 09:38.880
Oh, great,
so I'm the last to know?

09:38.880 --> 09:40.350
They have a great school there,
they have continuity.

09:40.350 --> 09:41.750
Don't take it personally.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.350
How can I not?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.090
It's just easier for them.

09:45.090 --> 09:47.690
They're used to you
not being there full-time.

09:47.690 --> 09:49.020
What do you mean?!

09:49.020 --> 09:50.960
I've been here full time
for the last three years.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.230
Not in your head.

09:53.230 --> 09:56.030
I'm sorry.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.470
How's Panama?

09:59.300 --> 10:02.300
Hot, getting hotter.

10:02.300 --> 10:05.110
I'm hoping
to settle things quick.

10:05.110 --> 10:07.570
We should visit the kids
at Christmas.

10:07.580 --> 10:09.810
Yep, okay.

10:10.980 --> 10:12.580
Tom, things are good.

10:12.580 --> 10:15.580
Considering everything,
they're real good.

10:15.580 --> 10:17.120
Go have fun
with your old friends,

10:17.120 --> 10:18.990
and I'll call you soon.

10:18.990 --> 10:20.250
I love you.

10:20.260 --> 10:21.720
Be safe.

10:52.150 --> 10:55.360
<i>Viva Tavo.</i>

10:55.360 --> 10:56.820
<i>IViva Tavo!</i>

11:33.160 --> 11:35.160
Welcome to the helo bay.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.700
This is where
Dr. Scott set up her lab.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.570
It was in this small,
sealed space

11:40.570 --> 11:44.840
that she developed the cure
and eventually tested it...

11:47.110 --> 11:49.310
On some of our crew.

11:49.310 --> 11:51.040
Come, step through this door

11:51.050 --> 11:54.580
and imagine yourself
in a bio-secure space,

11:54.580 --> 11:57.650
one where you would have to
wear a suit like this

11:57.650 --> 11:59.850
in order to protect yourself
from the virus.

11:59.860 --> 12:01.390
Excuse me, sir.

12:01.390 --> 12:04.320
So sorry to be a bother,
but would you mind?

12:04.330 --> 12:07.190
Not at all.
Oh, thanks much!

12:08.460 --> 12:11.500
You just press that button
right there.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.580
Attention on deck!

13:03.590 --> 13:04.720
There he is.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.720
Don't stop the reunion
on my account.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.260
Sir. Good to see you, Ray.

13:08.260 --> 13:09.460
Likewise, sir.

13:09.460 --> 13:10.990
Gator!

13:10.990 --> 13:13.390
How's civilian life treating you?

13:13.400 --> 13:15.260
Well, can't say
it's less stressful

13:15.260 --> 13:16.460
than being out at sea.

13:16.470 --> 13:17.730
My boy turned two yesterday.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.070
That's terrific.
Congrats.

13:20.070 --> 13:22.540
He's retired, but he's gonna
put on that uniform

13:22.540 --> 13:24.740
and be Gator
one last time tomorrow, right?

13:24.740 --> 13:27.070
Yeah, if I can find my sextant.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.540
They just can't leave.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.880
I keep promoting them, they
keep coming back.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.410
Captain.

13:32.410 --> 13:35.010
Nathan James has never looked better.
Thank you, sir.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.350
I'm just CO for the launch of the fleet.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.750
Then I'm on shore duty and mom duty.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.490
Sasha says Danny's doing all right.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.430
Well, you know more about him than I do.

13:45.430 --> 13:47.230
He's doing what makes him happy,

13:47.230 --> 13:49.660
or at least what keeps him sane.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.900
Hey, so how's school?

13:56.170 --> 13:57.910
Got a fresh crop of sailors,
ready to serve.

13:57.910 --> 13:59.440
That's what I like to hear.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.640
You still teaching "Moby-Dick"?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.110
One day,
I'm gonna make you read it.

14:02.110 --> 14:03.640
I think I've been been through
enough torture.

14:03.650 --> 14:05.310
Ready for your big speech?

14:05.310 --> 14:06.780
Mm.
We were one ship.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.650
Now we're a fleet. Life is good.
See?

14:09.650 --> 14:11.990
You don't need 800 pages.
Keep it simple.

14:11.990 --> 14:14.050
Captain Garnett, come in.
This is Captain Garnett.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.790
Your presence is requested on...

14:15.790 --> 14:18.460
Besides, you don't have to
say a thing, admiral.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.190
Just being here with all of us,

14:20.200 --> 14:21.390
there are no words.

14:37.950 --> 14:42.020
<i>Gracias.</i>

14:51.290 --> 14:53.030
Marco was right.

14:53.030 --> 14:55.560
This is the place to be.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.760
I'm offended we weren't invited.

15:00.170 --> 15:02.040
I could use a drink.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.940
Sleep tight, <i>amigo.</i>

15:37.940 --> 15:40.540
It is a shame, I know.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.210
I have never been through
the Canal,

15:43.210 --> 15:46.410
but from what I hear,
it is beautiful.

15:46.420 --> 15:47.750
You must go!

15:47.750 --> 15:50.150
I could take you on a drive.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.620
Through the rainforest
to a place,

15:52.620 --> 15:54.290
<i>a la cima de Volcan Baru.</i>

15:54.290 --> 15:57.360
From there,
you can see both oceans at once.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.760
Both oceans at once?

15:59.760 --> 16:01.700
To Volcan Baru.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.850
I'm afraid
you will have to wait your turn.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.590
The <i> Presidente</i> has many friends.

16:26.590 --> 16:27.990
Those are not friends,

16:27.990 --> 16:31.790
but as long as Fernando Asturius
controls the Panama Canal,

16:31.790 --> 16:33.660
he'll have many well-wishers.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.730
I'll take it as a good sign.

16:35.730 --> 16:38.070
The world is still
getting back on its feet,

16:38.070 --> 16:41.270
and global trade is a key factor
in promoting progress.

16:41.270 --> 16:42.540
You're American?

16:42.540 --> 16:44.400
Sasha Cooper.

16:44.410 --> 16:46.810
Hector Martinez.

16:46.810 --> 16:49.140
<i>Republica de Gran Colombia.</i>

16:49.140 --> 16:50.340
Gran Colombia?

16:50.350 --> 16:51.880
Mm.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.280
So those are <i> your</i> protestors
out on the street.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.680
Not mine.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.950
Those are Panamanians
who seek to keep Panama free.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.750
While holding up photos
of your leader.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.760
Gustavo Barros has inspired
all of South America

17:03.760 --> 17:07.359
to put aside centuries
of mistrust and come together.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.829
Tavo speaks for us all because
he puts the people first.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.369
He's a revolutionary.

17:13.369 --> 17:15.640
It's funny.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.910
When the US flexes its muscle,

17:17.910 --> 17:20.109
it is to protect world order.

17:20.109 --> 17:23.640
But when Latin Americans
stand up for their rights,

17:23.650 --> 17:25.310
they are revolutionaries.

17:54.010 --> 17:56.210
Well? Well?
We got work connections.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.750
We support
<i>El Presidente</i> Asturius.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.080
We only ask for the respect

18:02.080 --> 18:03.880
from the north
that we well deserve.

18:03.890 --> 18:06.020
How long will you be
in Panama City?

18:06.020 --> 18:08.690
Not long, I'm afraid.

18:08.690 --> 18:10.960
Oh, but I see
<i>El Presidente</i> is free,

18:10.960 --> 18:12.830
so I'm going to wish him
a happy birthday.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.560
I hope to see you again.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.570
I look forward to it.

18:54.140 --> 18:56.140
It was easy, Mr. President.

18:56.140 --> 18:59.270
In fact, it was <i> too</i> easy.

18:59.270 --> 19:02.740
There's enough C4 explosives
to kill everyone in this room.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.110
Including you, sir.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.550
Ah, ah. Careful.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.550
That's the second breach
of your security.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.290
That's three ways...
Three ways to kill you, sir.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.500
It's not poison.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.770
But it could have been.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.170
Your military leadership...

19:30.170 --> 19:33.240
They should not drink
with strangers.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.380
Your security

19:36.380 --> 19:39.580
and the security of the
Panama Canal are at great risk.

19:39.580 --> 19:41.850
I'm asking that
you reconsider our offer.

19:41.850 --> 19:43.920
Let us help you identify
your vulnerabilities,

19:43.920 --> 19:46.250
protect you while we train your
detail... And you think that this...

19:46.260 --> 19:49.120
This trick of yours
will convince me?

19:49.120 --> 19:52.330
To embarrass me
in front of my soldiers,

19:52.330 --> 19:56.060
my friends, at my own party?!

19:56.070 --> 19:58.330
No, Miss Cooper.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.470
I told you,
I cannot accept your help.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.010
If I'm seen clutching at
the knees <i> de Los Estados Unidos,</i>

20:06.010 --> 20:07.940
my own people will push me out!

20:07.940 --> 20:09.810
It can be done in secret.

20:09.810 --> 20:12.410
There are no secrets in Panama.

20:12.410 --> 20:17.680
So unless you plan
to kill me on my birthday,

20:17.690 --> 20:20.420
I suggest you leave.

21:18.780 --> 21:20.510
Burk!

21:20.520 --> 21:22.720
What the hell are you doing here?

21:22.720 --> 21:25.450
I thought you were X.O.
on the <i> James.</i> I am.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.850
My CO wanted me here
representing the ship

21:26.860 --> 21:29.120
while she took some tourists
on a cruise around the harbor.

21:29.130 --> 21:30.990
Yeah, I managed
to get out of that one, too.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.530
Ah, it's good fun.

21:32.530 --> 21:34.930
People seem to like it,
so, I don't know...

21:34.930 --> 21:38.000
Christ, Burk, when did I become
a museum exhibit?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.470
Oh, not an <i> exhibit.</i>

21:39.470 --> 21:41.440
A <i> legend,</i> sir.

21:49.880 --> 21:53.280
Subsurface, you hear anything?

21:53.280 --> 21:55.350
I'm picking up something.

21:55.350 --> 21:57.080
Could be biologics.

21:57.090 --> 22:00.620
Surface, what do you see?
No contacts on surface.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.560
Bridge, T.A.O.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.630
I think we found them.

22:05.630 --> 22:06.960
Copy.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.430
You're all in for a treat.

22:09.430 --> 22:11.900
Seems our sonar operator
found a pod of dolphins

22:11.900 --> 22:13.770
a thousand yards
off our port bow.

22:13.770 --> 22:17.170
We'll take you
for a closer look. Commander?

22:17.170 --> 22:19.310
Ma'am,
recommend new course 0-3-0.

22:19.310 --> 22:20.710
Very well.

22:20.710 --> 22:22.110
That's Gator.

22:22.110 --> 22:23.910
I know, Grandpa.

22:25.650 --> 22:27.580
<i>We are here at fleet week,</i>

22:27.580 --> 22:29.180
<i>and we are very excited.</i>

22:29.180 --> 22:31.720
<i>As you can see, there is
a crowd building behind me,</i>

22:31.720 --> 22:33.520
<i>and the Navy
is going to be showing off</i>

22:33.520 --> 22:35.190
<i>the strength of its fleet.</i>

22:35.190 --> 22:38.790
<i>And we are going to be talking
to Admiral Tom Chandler,</i>

22:38.790 --> 22:42.000
<i>and we'll have that for you
coming up next.</i>

22:55.210 --> 23:01.420
<i>Well, this is a great day
for the Navy, for our country.</i>

23:01.420 --> 23:03.680
<i>It's, uh,
proof of the resilience</i>

23:03.690 --> 23:05.350
<i>of the American people.</i>

23:37.520 --> 23:40.250
<i>That we could muster up
limited resou...</i>

23:50.400 --> 23:52.730
What just happened?

23:53.800 --> 23:56.400
I can't get fleet command
on the line.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.800
Something's wrong
with the satellite.

23:57.810 --> 23:59.270
No, we got bigger problems.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.610
What's going on?

24:12.750 --> 24:15.090
My God.

24:15.090 --> 24:16.760
Looks like we've been followed

24:16.760 --> 24:18.360
since we got in the country.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.090
And now we are
public enemy number one.

24:28.770 --> 24:31.440
Time to go.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.110
The <i> Federales</i>
are on their way here now!

24:40.380 --> 24:43.450
Is the military smaller now?

24:43.450 --> 24:44.850
Sure.
Um, so is the country.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.120
Look back throughout
our military history,

24:47.120 --> 24:48.450
you'll find plenty of examples

24:48.460 --> 24:49.790
where we're at
a diminished capacity,

24:49.790 --> 24:51.860
- we're unable...
- Sorry.

24:51.860 --> 24:53.330
We lost our satellite feed.

24:53.330 --> 24:55.330
I'm talking
to the guys in the van.

24:55.330 --> 24:56.800
Okay.
I'm so sorry.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.270
We're gonna get it fixed,
and we'll get right back to you.

25:06.740 --> 25:09.410
T.A.O., Aegis weapons,
fire control,

25:09.410 --> 25:10.940
and navigational radar
are failing.

25:10.950 --> 25:12.880
Something is frying
our 400-hertz switchboards.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.420
Emergency shut-down,
all systems.

25:15.420 --> 25:17.080
Shut everything down!

25:34.440 --> 25:35.940
Those aren't ours.

25:38.710 --> 25:40.640
And their wings aren't clean.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.310
Holy shit!
It's an attack.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.000
Take cover!

26:20.680 --> 26:23.550
Clear the deck!
Move it, move it, move it!

26:23.550 --> 26:26.320
Move, move, move!

26:43.910 --> 26:46.610
God, no.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.310
Move, move, move!

26:52.310 --> 26:53.780
Move!

26:55.380 --> 26:57.680
Move, move!
Clear the deck!

27:18.210 --> 27:20.470
Sir, sir!

27:20.480 --> 27:23.140
DC reports massive fires
portside on decks two and three.

27:23.140 --> 27:25.950
The hull has been breached. How the
hell did we not see this coming?!

27:25.950 --> 27:27.820
Early warning and radar systems
went dark across the base

27:27.820 --> 27:29.420
right before the attack, and our
weapons systems are down.

27:29.420 --> 27:30.620
I think we were hacked.

27:30.620 --> 27:32.350
You have stingers in the armory?

27:32.350 --> 27:33.820
Yes, sir!
Get the civilians off!

27:33.820 --> 27:36.090
I want all gunners
and crew served weapons

27:36.090 --> 27:37.490
manned by SCAT teams
up here now!

27:37.490 --> 27:40.030
All gunners, to the rails!

27:41.300 --> 27:43.230
No, no, we've lost contact,

27:43.230 --> 27:44.960
and reports are just coming in.

27:44.970 --> 27:46.630
This is the commander 2 MEF,

27:46.640 --> 27:48.900
I need a Marine on the ground
to tell me what's going on.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.570
Colonel, this is General Kinkaid.
I need all available assets

27:50.570 --> 27:52.770
mobilized in
Naval Station Mayport.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.370
We believe we're under attack.

27:54.380 --> 27:56.710
Let's get these systems
back online, team!

27:56.710 --> 27:58.510
I want eyes on that battlefield!

27:58.510 --> 28:00.580
Sir, DISN has been compromised.
Satellites are not responding,

28:00.580 --> 28:02.180
and our planes have been grounded.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.850
<i> Fleet command,
this is</i> Nathan James,<i> come in.</i>

28:03.850 --> 28:05.320
<i>We are under attack.</i>

28:05.320 --> 28:08.120
Hang tight,<i> Nathan James.</i>
We're doing what we can.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.530
Switch over to civilian band. We need our
comms. Admiral, we've got <i> Nathan James!</i>

28:12.530 --> 28:14.930
<i>Weapons and ISR are down.
We cannot defend.</i>

28:14.930 --> 28:18.270
Enemy aircraft appear to be
Pucara-class attack planes,

28:18.270 --> 28:19.600
but we have no radar.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.670
Get these people out of here!

28:43.890 --> 28:45.360
Over there!

28:45.360 --> 28:47.090
Gunners, cover the bow!

28:49.500 --> 28:50.960
I have CIWS back up.

28:50.970 --> 28:52.230
And the five-inch?

28:52.230 --> 28:54.770
Not yet.

28:54.770 --> 28:56.640
Bridge, T.A.O.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.240
We have CIWS, but we're at the
edge of maximum firing range.

28:59.240 --> 29:00.840
Recommend moving closer to base.

29:02.980 --> 29:04.310
Here comes another wave!

29:14.990 --> 29:16.590
Hey!
Hey, come this way!

29:16.590 --> 29:19.660
Come, come, quick! Keep your
head down! Head down, guys.

29:19.660 --> 29:22.130
To the bow!
Go, go, go!

29:32.740 --> 29:34.270
Ammo!

29:47.960 --> 29:49.290
No!

29:52.090 --> 29:54.690
Ma'am, I'm here.

29:54.700 --> 29:57.300
You're going to be just fine.
You'll be just fine.

29:57.300 --> 29:59.430
Just stay calm. We can fix this
like we always do, right?

30:19.860 --> 30:22.260
Ma'am, suggest
bearing 225 for 5 knots

30:22.260 --> 30:24.860
to get inside
effective CIWS range.

30:27.060 --> 30:29.400
Ma'am?

30:29.400 --> 30:31.130
Negative.
CIWS won't be enough.

30:31.130 --> 30:34.070
If we get ourselves seen,
we get ourselves sunk.

30:34.070 --> 30:37.470
Keep us out of sight and out
of the line of fire. But...

30:37.470 --> 30:39.670
I'm responsible
for every soul on this ship.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.410
And we're no good to the Navy
at the bottom of the bay.

30:42.410 --> 30:45.750
Our job is to be ready
to fight the battle to come.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.840
All right.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.180
<i>O'Connor</i> and <i> Cruz</i>
sank within an hour.

31:54.180 --> 31:57.720
God knows how many were trapped
on board when they went down.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.050
My God.

31:59.050 --> 32:01.390
Still can't get an accurate
report from the base.

32:01.390 --> 32:04.060
There were sailors and Marines
all over the place

32:04.060 --> 32:05.390
for the event.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.590
So we're talking hundreds,
if not thousands, dead.

32:07.600 --> 32:11.130
And for all we know,
this was just the first wave.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.200
There may be more
going on as we speak.

32:13.200 --> 32:16.000
Are you saying this is a full-scale
invasion of the United States?

32:16.000 --> 32:19.670
I'm saying I can't get one
goddamn Army base to report in!

32:19.670 --> 32:22.610
Our entire digital platform's
been wiped out,

32:22.610 --> 32:24.410
and we have no idea
what's going on.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.750
Look...
we have landlines.

32:26.750 --> 32:30.550
We don't know if they're
still secure, but they work.

32:30.550 --> 32:34.290
We need to get every
single person in uniform online

32:34.290 --> 32:37.090
and prepared
to defend this nation.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.830
Commander,
get to work on the computers.

32:41.830 --> 32:44.160
Find out who did this,
how they did it,

32:44.170 --> 32:46.030
and how to fix it.

32:46.030 --> 32:47.630
Aye, sir.

32:47.640 --> 32:51.210
Now somebody bring me
a goddamn map!

34:16.860 --> 34:21.130
Airmen, can your birds fly?

34:21.130 --> 34:22.530
No, sir.

34:22.530 --> 34:24.730
Anything with an on board
computer was hacked.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.800
They wiped us out on the ground.
I need a corpsman.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.469
My chief... he's hit bad.
Go, go.

34:38.080 --> 34:41.280
We'll get you all back to land
as soon as possible.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.679
But is it safe?

34:42.690 --> 34:45.350
Sir, we'll make sure, but
everyone, just hang tight, okay?

34:45.350 --> 34:47.690
We're all in this together.

34:47.690 --> 34:50.560
Gator?

34:50.560 --> 34:52.690
You should go back
with the guests.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.630
Ma'am, I... You put on the
uniform for the cruise.

34:54.630 --> 34:56.960
But this isn't your fight.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.300
Your family needs you.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.500
My family knows we're all alive

35:00.500 --> 35:01.970
because of <i> Nathan James.</i>

35:01.970 --> 35:03.570
If it's all the same to you,
Captain,

35:03.570 --> 35:06.040
I didn't fight by your side
just to give up now.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.110
I'd like to return
to active duty,

35:09.110 --> 35:11.110
if you'll have me.

35:12.780 --> 35:14.250
Thank you.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.390
Command, come in.

35:20.390 --> 35:23.120
This is intercept team delta, over.

35:23.130 --> 35:25.990
I say again,
this is intercept team delta.

35:27.730 --> 35:30.530
Where have you been? The streets
are crawling with <i> Federales,</i> man!

35:30.530 --> 35:32.600
We got
to get out of here.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.600
Uh, I have some bad news.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.140
The US Navy fleet in Florida
was just attacked.

35:37.140 --> 35:39.210
All the ships were sunk,
and thousands are dead.

35:39.210 --> 35:41.410
What did you just say?

35:41.410 --> 35:43.010
Tavo's taking credit for it

35:43.010 --> 35:44.810
as revenge for the murder
of <i> El Presidente</i>

35:44.810 --> 35:47.810
by <i> los Americanos!</i>
That's no coincidence.

35:47.820 --> 35:51.480
You don't overthrow Panama
while the US fleet is a threat.

35:51.490 --> 35:53.490
No, this was
a coordinated attack.

35:53.490 --> 35:55.160
Panama is now
under the protection

35:55.160 --> 35:57.090
of Tavo and Gran Colombia.

35:57.090 --> 35:59.630
We have to get back
to the States.

35:59.630 --> 36:02.160
There's no point
in rushing home now.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.230
Danny, our fleet was hit.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.100
Our friends, our family...

36:06.100 --> 36:07.170
They may be dead,

36:07.170 --> 36:10.640
but for what comes next,
we're on the front line.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.910
We have no orders from home,

36:12.910 --> 36:15.640
but we know who the enemy is.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.850
I say we go south,
toward Colombia.

36:18.850 --> 36:21.980
We gather intelligence,
allies, anything.

36:21.980 --> 36:25.050
We put ourselves in a position
to be the tip of the spear

36:25.050 --> 36:27.450
until backup arrives.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.670
Can you get us to Colombia?

36:41.670 --> 36:44.870
<i>Sí.</i>
I know some people.

37:42.930 --> 37:44.660
<i>Ya Basta.</i>

37:44.670 --> 37:45.870
<i>Ya Basta.</i>

37:45.870 --> 37:47.330
<i> Ya Basta!</i>

37:48.140 --> 37:51.670
I will now speak
directly to our enemies

37:51.670 --> 37:54.940
<i>in a language
they can understand.</i>

37:54.940 --> 37:57.410
<i>Americans, you are on notice.</i>

37:57.410 --> 38:01.680
<i>The people of Central
and South America are united!</i>

38:01.680 --> 38:05.820
<i>We will no longer cower in fear
of your big stick.</i>

38:05.820 --> 38:10.220
<i>For you do not offer us
protection, but enslavement.</i>

38:10.230 --> 38:14.830
<i>Today marks the beginning
of a new equilibrium.</i>

38:14.830 --> 38:20.170
<i>Gran Colombia will no longer
sit at the children's table</i>

38:20.170 --> 38:22.700
<i>of international politics.</i>

38:22.700 --> 38:24.100
<i>It is our turn!</i>

38:24.110 --> 38:25.370
<i>Be warned.</i>

38:25.370 --> 38:28.910
<i>If the United States
wants a fight,</i>

38:28.910 --> 38:31.650
<i>you will lose.</i>

38:31.650 --> 38:34.050
For in the words
of Simón Bolivar,

38:34.050 --> 38:38.420
a people
who love their freedom...

38:39.320 --> 38:43.320
will, in the end, be free.

38:43.330 --> 38:46.060
And we are united...

38:46.060 --> 38:48.460
as a continent...

38:48.460 --> 38:52.130
to fight for that freedom.

38:54.140 --> 38:57.400
<i>We are one nation under God!</i>

38:57.410 --> 39:00.070
<i>La Gran Colombia!</i>

39:11.090 --> 39:12.490
<i>Al Norte!</i>

39:12.490 --> 39:15.220
<i>Al Norte! Al Norte!</i>

39:19.360 --> 39:21.490
<i>IViva Tavo!</i>

39:21.500 --> 39:23.230
<i>IViva Tavo!
IViva Tavo! iViva Tavo!</i>

39:23.230 --> 39:26.100
<i>IViva Gran Colombia!</i>

39:28.040 --> 39:29.840
Turn it off.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.040
We must've been hacked.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.250
Comms, grounded air defenses,
even our weapons systems.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.450
We're at war.

39:39.450 --> 39:41.110
I have to get back
to fleet command,

39:41.120 --> 39:42.720
get eyes on the battlefield.

39:42.720 --> 39:43.920
Admiral Chandler.

40:03.540 --> 40:07.270
Diaz!
Is the <i> James</i> still afloat?!

40:07.280 --> 40:08.540
Yes, sir!

40:08.540 --> 40:10.740
Make a hole.
I'm going back with you.

40:10.750 --> 40:12.610
Yes, sir!
I'm going, too.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.010
Tell Meylan... Mike.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.420
I lost my fleet, Tom.

40:15.420 --> 40:16.750
It went down on my watch.

40:16.750 --> 40:19.290
If I'm gonna die,
I'm going down with the ship.

40:19.290 --> 40:21.820
You heard that speech,
you know where to start.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.160
We head south.

40:23.160 --> 40:25.360
Look for weapons and fuel.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.960
Stay off comms.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.360
I'll be in touch!

40:28.360 --> 40:29.900
If I don't hear from you soon,

40:29.900 --> 40:31.970
I'm gonna come looking for you!
I don't doubt that.

40:31.970 --> 40:34.300
You stay safe!
