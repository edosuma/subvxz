00:46.893 --> 00:48.690
[Flies buzzing]

01:25.665 --> 01:27.462
[Whistles]

01:40.280 --> 01:41.645
Piringo.

01:43.283 --> 01:47.276
Been looking for you.

01:47.354 --> 01:52.656
It's the end of the road for you.

01:55.295 --> 01:58.787
[Bell clangs]

02:02.969 --> 02:06.530
What's that sound?

02:06.606 --> 02:12.135
That's the sound of
the Gion Shoja temple bells.

02:12.212 --> 02:14.180
What?

02:14.247 --> 02:18.343
You know, them
Heike and Genji boys.

02:18.418 --> 02:19.749
On a distant island,

02:19.820 --> 02:25.258
these two clans split into
the Reds and the Whites.

02:25.325 --> 02:27.850
Wage war.

02:27.928 --> 02:31.955
Sort of like that
War of the Roses, you know?

02:32.032 --> 02:34.193
In England?

02:34.267 --> 02:37.395
Who won?

02:37.471 --> 02:39.302
The Whites?

02:40.841 --> 02:45.301
This high noon battle
was waged in Dannoura.

02:45.378 --> 02:50.315
Hear the Heike clan in red
got themselves hog-tied

02:50.383 --> 02:53.216
by the Genji clan in white.

02:53.286 --> 02:58.849
Their story goes
a little something like this.

02:58.925 --> 03:01.587
[Japanese accent]
The sound

03:01.661 --> 03:05.290
of the Gion Shoja temple bells

03:05.365 --> 03:08.562
echoes the impermanence

03:08.635 --> 03:10.364
of all things.

03:10.437 --> 03:13.406
What bells you say?

03:13.473 --> 03:16.909
The color
of the sala flower

03:16.977 --> 03:19.878
reveals the truth

03:19.946 --> 03:22.574
that to flourish

03:22.649 --> 03:24.549
is to fall.

03:24.618 --> 03:27.143
[Bell clangs]

03:30.590 --> 03:35.027
The proud do not endure

03:35.095 --> 03:39.259
like a passing dream

03:39.332 --> 03:43.598
on a night in spring.

04:05.458 --> 04:07.483
The mighty

04:07.561 --> 04:10.325
fall at last.

04:11.598 --> 04:14.533
See you in hell.

04:22.342 --> 04:26.711
To be no more than
dust before the wind.

04:38.491 --> 04:39.890
Piringo.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.758
That's why I love you.

04:57.510 --> 05:00.536
[Yells]

05:46.059 --> 05:48.254
Ain't nothing back there.

05:50.196 --> 05:53.165
You ain't heard me?

05:53.233 --> 05:56.202
It's an ain't nothing town.

05:57.704 --> 06:00.468
Bet you came
for the gold, too.

06:00.540 --> 06:04.340
White or Red?

06:06.012 --> 06:08.037
You Genji

06:08.114 --> 06:10.605
or Heike?

08:22.115 --> 08:25.710
Which gang's gonna buy it?

08:27.787 --> 08:30.847
My reward is one third.

08:30.924 --> 08:36.089
If there ain't no treasure, don't pay.

08:37.530 --> 08:40.499
Benkei, show him.

08:40.567 --> 08:45.561
No doubt about who's
gonna be left standing.

08:45.638 --> 08:50.803
But best not get any ideas
about playing Yojimbo.

08:50.877 --> 08:56.247
You got to be alive to
spend your money, stranger.

09:12.131 --> 09:16.397
The kid's got a heart,
and balls to match.

09:18.905 --> 09:21.806
No! Join us!

09:21.875 --> 09:24.207
We'll do better than a third!

09:24.277 --> 09:26.108
We'll leave you half!

09:26.179 --> 09:27.373
Half?

09:28.748 --> 09:31.046
We'll give you everything.

09:31.117 --> 09:36.680
But with us, it's a lifetime contract.

09:38.825 --> 09:39.883
Don't know about that.

09:39.959 --> 09:44.089
I don't stay long in one place.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.258
Suits us fine!

09:49.335 --> 09:53.237
We'll give you half
for this one-time deal.

10:10.356 --> 10:13.120
Not too shabby.

10:17.030 --> 10:19.897
[Woman]
Hey, boy!

10:19.966 --> 10:23.561
Hey. If you're
such a quick draw,

10:23.636 --> 10:25.831
you don't need them.

10:25.905 --> 10:28.465
Take it all.

10:28.541 --> 10:33.604
And tell them to shove
their lifetime contract.

10:35.048 --> 10:39.280
Boy, don't rush yourself.

10:39.352 --> 10:44.551
Make your choice
after cooling your heels.

10:44.624 --> 10:47.593
This town can't grow from seed,

10:47.660 --> 10:52.063
but I can offer
some soba tea at my place.

10:52.131 --> 10:54.463
Come with me.

10:56.102 --> 10:57.967
Hey.

11:11.017 --> 11:13.417
So the Reds
rode in first, eh?

11:13.486 --> 11:16.717
Yeah. How do you figure that?

11:20.093 --> 11:21.390
Simple.

11:21.461 --> 11:23.292
With the sheriff,

11:23.363 --> 11:26.890
seeing the law hitched
with the weaker side

11:26.966 --> 11:31.335
must mean they made him
an offer he couldn't refuse.

11:31.404 --> 11:34.202
Uh, of course, now,

11:34.273 --> 11:39.734
maybe he's looking
for a chance to switch sides.

11:41.481 --> 11:44.109
<i>How long has it been like this?</i>

11:46.419 --> 11:50.549
<i>Two months since</i>
<i>the Heikes walked in.</i>

11:50.623 --> 11:52.955
<i>And before that,</i>

11:53.026 --> 11:55.961
<i>gold prospectors</i>
<i>started coming 'round.</i>

12:06.272 --> 12:09.173
What?

12:09.242 --> 12:11.733
<i>But what we couldn't</i>
<i>figure out was</i>

12:11.811 --> 12:15.577
<i>why so many people,</i>
<i>and why now?</i>

12:15.648 --> 12:17.309
The end of last month,

12:17.383 --> 12:19.578
a town with the same legend

12:19.652 --> 12:20.983
found the mother lode.

12:21.054 --> 12:26.856
The country's gone crazy
with Heike gold tales.

12:26.926 --> 12:28.860
Every nook and cranny
of every town

12:28.928 --> 12:30.190
with the treasure legend

12:30.263 --> 12:32.561
is swarming with prospectors.

12:32.632 --> 12:39.094
It's a genuine gold rush!
Yee-ha ha ha!

12:43.810 --> 12:48.406
You can't touch this land,
or you'll be cursed.

12:48.481 --> 12:49.470
[Man]
Ha!

12:49.549 --> 12:52.177
We'll take that curse
off your hands.

12:52.251 --> 12:56.085
And we can't quietly sit by
as you lay waste to our land!

12:56.155 --> 12:57.213
[Clang]
Ow!

13:11.771 --> 13:13.102
<i>{Woman]</i>
<i>In the beginning,</i>

13:13.172 --> 13:16.835
<i>we expected them</i>
<i>to be a godsend</i>

13:16.909 --> 13:20.037
<i>because they were Heike,</i>
<i>like us.</i>

13:23.349 --> 13:26.250
<i>But things soon went sour.</i>

13:27.653 --> 13:30.816
<i>The Heikes</i>
<i>ran off the prospectors</i>

13:30.890 --> 13:32.949
<i>and started digging.</i>

13:36.229 --> 13:37.628
Look!

13:37.697 --> 13:38.664
What?

13:38.731 --> 13:41.199
Kiyomori! Boss Kiyomori!

13:41.267 --> 13:43.235
We found this.

13:43.302 --> 13:48.433
<i>Instead of that wood marker</i>
<i>that read "Fear the curse".</i>

13:48.508 --> 13:50.874
I knew it!
[Laughs]

13:50.943 --> 13:56.575
<i>So they figured the treasure</i>
<i>must be somewhere,</i>

13:56.649 --> 13:59.243
<i>and they have</i>
<i>been here since.</i>

13:59.318 --> 14:00.717
[Laughter]

14:02.822 --> 14:06.383
[Screaming]

14:24.977 --> 14:27.036
<i>Boss Kiyomori.</i>

14:32.485 --> 14:36.478
From today, you're one of us.

14:36.556 --> 14:41.619
Think of it as being on vacation.

14:41.694 --> 14:44.561
Uh, yes.

14:44.630 --> 14:47.497
I've been meaning
to take some time off.

14:47.567 --> 14:50.035
Feeling a little beside myself.

14:53.105 --> 14:56.700
<i>But his reign of power</i>
<i>didn't last long.</i>

15:05.718 --> 15:07.049
Dang.

15:08.187 --> 15:11.520
You boys are a day late
and a dollar short.

15:11.591 --> 15:13.582
This is our town.

15:16.996 --> 15:18.293
Huh?

15:20.366 --> 15:21.355
Ooh...

15:26.572 --> 15:27.596
Dang.

15:38.551 --> 15:39.540
[Gasping]

15:52.898 --> 15:55.594
Genjis.

15:57.036 --> 16:02.599
Shigemori, we got to
fatten you up, boy.

16:03.809 --> 16:06.437
<i>Boss Yoshitsune.</i>

16:17.890 --> 16:22.156
<i>The Genjis didn't make</i>
<i>a move against the Heikes.</i>

16:22.228 --> 16:24.958
<i>They left the gold digging to them,</i>

16:25.031 --> 16:30.196
<i>sat back, and waited</i>
<i>for their chance to steal the loot.</i>

16:39.278 --> 16:40.506
Hey.

16:43.015 --> 16:45.381
Finders keepers.

16:45.451 --> 16:49.547
<i>After that,</i>
<i>people began to leave.</i>

16:49.622 --> 16:52.250
<i>Just a few families are left.</i>

16:52.325 --> 16:56.261
Ah, we might as well hire you.

16:56.329 --> 17:00.732
But all the town can offer is this.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.234
Dadacha-mame.

17:03.369 --> 17:05.564
Try this.

17:05.637 --> 17:08.936
Hey. Hey, welcome back.

17:11.377 --> 17:15.814
This is my grandson.
Heihachi.

17:33.299 --> 17:35.631
Give it a go.

17:43.576 --> 17:47.012
Death isn't to be feared.

17:59.191 --> 18:02.683
Don't watch the blade.

18:02.762 --> 18:04.889
How many times
do I have to tell you?

18:04.964 --> 18:07.296
Don't follow the blade
with your eyes.

18:07.366 --> 18:10.995
Don't see it, feel it.

18:11.070 --> 18:14.801
That's the essence
of Mononofu training.

18:16.175 --> 18:20.942
Mononofu training
ain't samurai bullshit.

18:21.013 --> 18:24.744
Being a samurai is
a philosophical way of life.

18:24.817 --> 18:30.187
But the life of Mononofu
means life of fighting!

18:32.892 --> 18:34.587
If you ask me,

18:34.660 --> 18:38.926
samurai are still
wearing their skiwies.

18:38.998 --> 18:41.091
They are vain.

18:41.167 --> 18:44.466
They're still concerned
about their looks.

18:44.537 --> 18:48.132
That's "tits on the bull" thinking.

18:51.076 --> 18:54.842
But if you peel away that last layer

18:54.914 --> 18:59.374
so you are naked,

18:59.452 --> 19:02.444
this in the raw fighting the spirit is

19:02.521 --> 19:06.252
warrior's lot in life.

19:06.325 --> 19:09.624
His realm,

19:09.695 --> 19:11.890
our realm

19:11.964 --> 19:15.195
is deeper than the samurai's.

19:30.082 --> 19:31.481
Now...

19:34.119 --> 19:36.485
you gonna come at me

19:36.555 --> 19:39.183

20:35.581 --> 20:36.980
[Yells]

21:02.274 --> 21:03.866
What's it gonna be?

21:03.943 --> 21:07.572
Take this handsome man
to the Reds

21:07.646 --> 21:11.707
or hand him over to the Whites?

21:11.784 --> 21:15.242
You know, I'm at sea.

21:15.321 --> 21:18.017
I don't know.

21:18.090 --> 21:19.819
Depends on him.

21:29.201 --> 21:31.635
Today's special is the Whites

21:31.704 --> 21:34.639
with a side of
mashed potatoes and soup.

21:34.707 --> 21:37.267
Forget about the Heike gang.

21:37.343 --> 21:41.677
Their Boss Kiyomori smells
like a dead dog on a hot day.

21:41.747 --> 21:44.944
He's lost so much,
he's getting dumber.

21:51.223 --> 21:56.718
"The sound of
the Gion Shoja temple bells

21:56.795 --> 22:03.530

22:03.669 --> 22:05.068
You follow?

22:05.137 --> 22:09.403
Yes, l... uh...

22:09.475 --> 22:13.741
It means everything in this
old world changes.

22:13.812 --> 22:18.772
It means we can never
call our services off.

22:18.851 --> 22:22.514
We'll finally restore the glory

22:22.588 --> 22:26.115
of our family name
and the riding-high.

22:26.191 --> 22:29.854

22:46.478 --> 22:48.537
That's it.

22:48.614 --> 22:50.878
It's a law of nature.

The Genjis are going down!

[Men shout]

22:57.790 --> 23:01.191
From today,

23:01.260 --> 23:05.094
I read this.

23:05.164 --> 23:07.325
What's that?

23:07.399 --> 23:11.665
Shakespeare. <i>Henry VI.</i>

23:11.737 --> 23:13.762
The War of the Roses.

23:13.839 --> 23:17.707
War of the Roses?

23:17.776 --> 23:19.403
Come on, boy.

23:19.478 --> 23:22.003
Don't you know your Shakespeare?

23:22.081 --> 23:26.541
It's a story about
the Reds winning the war.

23:26.618 --> 23:29.314
The Reds win?

23:29.388 --> 23:31.652
Yes, we'll win.

23:35.594 --> 23:39.189
Yeah! Kiyomori!

23:40.966 --> 23:43.196
What?

23:43.268 --> 23:45.293
Kiyomori.

23:50.476 --> 23:51.670
[Thump]

23:56.215 --> 23:59.412
Don't ever call me
Kiyomori again!

24:03.255 --> 24:04.916
From today...

24:09.161 --> 24:14.224
the name's... Henry.

24:19.705 --> 24:23.402
Side with the Genjis.

24:23.475 --> 24:28.469
They got a young lady,
fine as cream gravy.

24:28.547 --> 24:31.641
That painted lady
used to be a dancer.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.688
She's the kid's mama,
but still mighty fine.

24:37.756 --> 24:40.190
Hasn't aged a bit.

24:40.259 --> 24:44.491
A woman of true
Genji lineage.

He's Genji and Heike?

24:47.699 --> 24:51.692
Huh? Oh, the kid?

24:51.770 --> 24:56.400
Yeah, he's a half-breed.

24:56.475 --> 24:58.636
And his father?

24:58.710 --> 25:00.735
Got himself killed.

25:12.224 --> 25:18.459
You're of

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

25:40.853 --> 25:44.846
He can't talk no more.

25:44.923 --> 25:49.087
Hard to after seeing
your dad murdered.

25:51.063 --> 25:53.429
What's his mother doing
on the Genji side?

25:54.633 --> 25:55.895
Ahem.

25:58.804 --> 26:04.504

<i>brought the Genji woman home.</i>

26:17.089 --> 26:23.653
Mama, the days of being
Genji or Heike are done with.

26:31.303 --> 26:34.795
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>or where the two met,</i>

26:34.873 --> 26:38.639
<i>but his mother</i>
<i>blessed their marriage.</i>

26:38.710 --> 26:42.168
<i>So Red and White got hitched,</i>

26:42.247 --> 26:44.715
<i>and they figured</i>
<i>crossing roses,</i>

26:44.783 --> 26:48.514
<i>blooming in both colors,</i>
<i>was romantic.</i>

26:59.031 --> 27:01.431
<i>And they raised Heihachi,</i>

27:01.500 --> 27:05.027
<i>their Red and White treasure.</i>

27:06.271 --> 27:11.868
<i>But then the fighting</i>
<i>started again.</i>

27:16.915 --> 27:19.509
Finders keepers.

27:23.522 --> 27:24.614
Ugh!

27:28.060 --> 27:29.584
Kiyomori!

27:33.198 --> 27:37.692
Get out.
There ain't no gold here.

27:39.271 --> 27:40.863
That's it?

27:43.642 --> 27:46.304
Take it all!

27:46.378 --> 27:48.710
If you want it, take it.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.372
And get out!

27:55.554 --> 27:56.987
[Heihachi]
Daddy!

27:58.190 --> 28:00.750
Heihachi!

28:00.826 --> 28:03.454
Daddy!

28:12.237 --> 28:16.435
[Screaming]

28:21.613 --> 28:23.513
Love hurts.

28:23.582 --> 28:26.050
[Screaming]

28:45.070 --> 28:48.597
My favorite color.

28:48.673 --> 28:51.301
Looks good on you.

28:51.376 --> 28:54.971
<i>Folks say a Genji woman</i>
<i>painted red</i>

28:55.047 --> 28:56.344
<i>lit a flame in him.</i>

28:56.415 --> 28:57.780
[Gasping]

28:57.849 --> 29:00.079
- [Laughing]
- [Screaming]

29:01.253 --> 29:03.517
No! No!

29:03.588 --> 29:05.783
Aah!

29:05.857 --> 29:08.348
I'll teach you good!

29:11.163 --> 29:13.996
I show you what a real man is!

29:14.066 --> 29:16.057
[Screaming]

29:18.503 --> 29:22.200
I know, I know.

29:33.752 --> 29:38.485
<i>So she ran to the hideout</i>
<i>of her own flesh and blood.</i>

29:40.592 --> 29:42.958
<i>Was it to protect her son,</i>

29:43.028 --> 29:45.428
<i>or get vengeance</i>
<i>for her husband?</i>

29:55.707 --> 29:59.040
[Grunting]

34:12.330 --> 34:15.231
How much for the lady?

34:17.969 --> 34:19.664
How much you got?

34:22.306 --> 34:25.275
Depends on how much
you'll pay me.

34:33.451 --> 34:36.318
[Men shouting]

35:21.699 --> 35:24.133
[Yells]

35:47.325 --> 35:52.388
Keep it in your pants, lily liver.

35:52.464 --> 35:56.525
The tougher man gets the girl.

36:06.478 --> 36:08.275
Do what you like.

36:10.348 --> 36:13.317
Do her here, upstairs.

36:13.384 --> 36:17.514
Wherever and however
you please.

36:24.729 --> 36:26.856
You are the second
cunning wolf

36:26.931 --> 36:30.958
I ever really wanted
to draw iron at.

36:31.035 --> 36:33.526
Who was the first?

36:33.605 --> 36:35.334
A legend.

36:37.108 --> 36:41.306
One I heard
when I was a kid.

36:43.081 --> 36:45.641
Oh, yeah?

36:50.722 --> 36:54.089
The Bloody...

36:57.128 --> 37:00.359
Benten.

37:01.933 --> 37:06.336
Bloody Benten.

37:07.906 --> 37:13.776
The fighting goddess legend.

37:13.845 --> 37:16.313
Shit.

37:19.183 --> 37:23.279
Now I really want
to draw iron at you.

37:33.131 --> 37:37.591
[Trumpet]

37:48.880 --> 37:51.781
Nice.

37:51.849 --> 37:54.579
[Sighs]

37:58.289 --> 38:00.849
Ain't refined,

38:00.925 --> 38:05.487
but it hits you deep down.

38:07.465 --> 38:11.561
The Anasazi play that music.

38:11.636 --> 38:16.835
They were here
before any of us.

38:16.908 --> 38:21.845
They still keep the old ways.

40:04.716 --> 40:07.446
You'll do fine.

40:07.518 --> 40:12.455
I want Kiyomori dead.

40:15.827 --> 40:21.732
You've thrown away your body,
everything, all for revenge?

40:21.799 --> 40:25.496
So what?

40:25.570 --> 40:28.471
Don't pity me.

40:28.539 --> 40:31.508
I don't need useless
compassion from you.

40:31.576 --> 40:36.377
Good. It ain't
good for nothing, huh?

40:41.753 --> 40:44.984
Do you want me?

40:47.358 --> 40:49.792
<i>Very much.</i>

40:52.063 --> 40:55.191
But be careful.

40:55.266 --> 41:01.535
Yoshitsune's men left town
to get a <i>powerful</i> weapon.

41:01.606 --> 41:04.234
Yoichi wants you dead.

41:04.308 --> 41:07.106
They'll likely be here by sunup.

41:09.680 --> 41:13.673
When the shooting starts,

41:13.751 --> 41:18.586
take Heihachi and
escape to the mountains.

41:18.656 --> 41:22.114
You're not gonna run?

41:22.193 --> 41:23.125
[Sighs]

41:23.194 --> 41:28.689
Oh, you got something
against them, too?

41:28.766 --> 41:31.200
I got my reasons.

42:18.349 --> 42:22.809
Have the roses
bloomed yet?

42:22.887 --> 42:26.789
What are they named?

42:32.730 --> 42:35.995
Love.

42:44.508 --> 42:46.738
Howdy, Sheriff.

42:53.918 --> 42:58.378
"A special weapon
will be here soon.

42:58.456 --> 43:00.356
"Before the Genjis get it,

43:00.424 --> 43:02.551
"tell the Heike's to
bushwhack their wagons.

43:02.627 --> 43:06.393
If you don't, we'll all be killed."

43:08.299 --> 43:11.132
[Sighs]
Sorry.

43:14.272 --> 43:17.036
What are you doing, boy?

43:17.108 --> 43:20.100
Shit or get off the pot!

43:30.655 --> 43:32.782
Hold your horses.

43:32.857 --> 43:36.691
Instead of telling them
the godawful truth,

43:36.761 --> 43:39.889
don't you reckon
we better hightail it?

43:45.469 --> 43:49.166
I ain't listening to you no more.

43:51.542 --> 43:54.238
Kiyomori!

43:54.312 --> 43:56.109
Boss Kiyomori!

43:57.782 --> 43:59.215
Aah!

44:00.318 --> 44:02.912
The name's Henry.

44:02.987 --> 44:05.421
Where have you been?

44:08.526 --> 44:12.053
I was spying on the Genjis,

44:12.129 --> 44:15.690
and things are getting
way out of hand.

44:17.268 --> 44:19.065
Excuse me.

44:19.136 --> 44:21.263
Come again?

44:41.625 --> 44:42.990
Whoa!

44:46.030 --> 44:50.899

See-ya! See-ya! See-ya! See-ya!

44:50.968 --> 44:52.060
See-ya! See-ya!

44:52.136 --> 44:56.835
I told you we should've
skipped town.

44:56.907 --> 44:59.705
I told you.

45:07.151 --> 45:10.279
Shit. Whoa!

Go!

Hah!

Whoa!

[Yelling]

46:42.213 --> 46:44.511
[Sheriff yelling]

46:51.322 --> 46:53.722
Stupid.

47:21.051 --> 47:23.315
You did this.

[Whistles]

47:30.928 --> 47:32.896
[Neigh]

47:35.833 --> 47:39.064
Fire, boys, and guard the windows.

48:35.125 --> 48:38.060
How'd he pull that off?

48:39.063 --> 48:40.655
Come!

48:43.934 --> 48:46.801
Ichiro. Matsui.

48:52.843 --> 48:54.367
Follow me.

48:54.445 --> 48:56.003
What happened?

48:56.080 --> 48:57.445
Tell you later!

48:57.514 --> 48:59.004
We're going to the old man's
place in the mountains.

48:59.083 --> 49:01.608
Heihachi! Heihachi!
Come on, hurry!

49:01.685 --> 49:03.380
- Come on!
- This way.

49:26.143 --> 49:28.543
Watch your step.

49:30.147 --> 49:32.115
Take Heihachi
and go without me.

49:32.182 --> 49:33.444
What did you forget?

49:33.517 --> 49:35.542
Something important!

49:35.619 --> 49:37.052
What's wrong?

50:01.245 --> 50:05.409
Forget them!
You don't need them!

50:07.951 --> 50:10.112
No! They're...

50:10.187 --> 50:11.552
[thunk]

50:26.637 --> 50:30.095
They're...

50:30.174 --> 50:31.664
They're my...

[Horse galloping]

50:51.395 --> 50:52.885

No matter what,
one of you's gonna die.

51:12.015 --> 51:15.041
[Woman]
Heihachi. Please.

51:15.119 --> 51:18.054
Please, not him.

51:18.122 --> 51:21.455
If you want him to live,

51:21.525 --> 51:27.395
drop... your... guns.
[Laughing]

51:41.311 --> 51:44.109
Stop bitching! Hyah!

52:01.331 --> 52:04.027
The time is now!

52:04.101 --> 52:06.729
Ho!

52:32.863 --> 52:35.559
Hey. Hey!

52:44.174 --> 52:48.338
Die!

52:51.949 --> 52:53.883
Hmm.

52:53.951 --> 52:55.816
[Grunt]

52:58.388 --> 53:00.549
Haah!

53:39.530 --> 53:40.895
Aah!

Lucky me.

Shigemori,

56:30.734 --> 56:35.034
I won't die until we win.

56:43.747 --> 56:45.874
Uhh... Uh...

56:46.950 --> 56:48.577
Payback's a bitch!

56:56.226 --> 56:59.389
Before you die...

57:02.733 --> 57:06.635
I have something sweet.

57:40.871 --> 57:43.931
You want some, bitch?

57:49.346 --> 57:52.679
You are an animal.

58:13.069 --> 58:16.197
Toshio!
Throw it here!

58:46.603 --> 58:49.766
Can't be...

58:49.840 --> 58:52.308
bloody...

59:15.498 --> 59:17.557
Heihachi.

59:17.634 --> 59:20.330
Heihachi.

59:20.403 --> 59:23.861
What are you doing?

59:27.978 --> 59:30.344
Open your eyes.

59:30.413 --> 59:32.040
Hmm?

59:32.115 --> 59:33.844
See for yourself.

59:36.586 --> 59:39.384
You can't close them
to reality.

59:39.456 --> 59:40.980
[Gasping]

59:41.057 --> 59:43.787
Open your eyes!

59:43.860 --> 59:46.988
Heihachi! Heihachi!

59:47.063 --> 59:50.726
Open your eyes!

01:00:13.056 --> 01:00:14.580
Aah!

01:00:32.676 --> 01:00:35.577
Could you
visit this address

01:00:35.645 --> 01:00:39.706
and stock up on these?

01:00:39.783 --> 01:00:43.719
If he is still alive,

01:00:43.787 --> 01:00:48.747
my signature here
should help you out.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.587
I wish I could go,

01:00:52.662 --> 01:00:54.994
but I can't
leave the boy alone.

01:00:55.065 --> 01:00:55.997
Ruriko.

01:00:56.066 --> 01:00:57.795
Hmm?

01:00:57.867 --> 01:01:02.531
But these are guns.

01:01:02.605 --> 01:01:05.733
Tell him I need help,

01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:09.370
and he owes me.

01:01:09.446 --> 01:01:13.143
You are the only one
I can depend on.

01:01:46.716 --> 01:01:50.015
What's "BB"?

01:01:50.086 --> 01:01:54.523
When this doubly
talented goddess

01:01:54.591 --> 01:01:57.492
used to play music.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.893
She would hold
her instruments
in both hands.

01:02:00.964 --> 01:02:04.991
But when she was
on the warpath,

01:02:05.068 --> 01:02:08.834
she held weapons
in eight hands.

01:02:17.347 --> 01:02:21.010
When the fire of vengeance dwelled in her
eyes,

01:02:21.084 --> 01:02:24.781
this murdering goddess
was wide awake,

01:02:24.854 --> 01:02:29.086
and everything in her way
got stained blood red.

01:02:36.299 --> 01:02:39.564
They dubbed her
Bloody Benten.

01:02:44.774 --> 01:02:49.370
Nicknamed double B for short.

01:02:50.547 --> 01:02:53.072
I was the one who
educated her in killing,

01:02:53.149 --> 01:02:55.549
and it was tough going.

01:02:57.954 --> 01:03:00.616
You like it?

01:03:04.594 --> 01:03:05.959
It's too sweet.

01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:08.725
Well...
Too much sugar.

01:03:08.798 --> 01:03:11.699
This is sukiyaki,
not a damn lollipop!

01:03:11.768 --> 01:03:14.862
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:03:14.938 --> 01:03:19.432
How many times
do I gotta tell you

01:03:19.509 --> 01:03:23.309
before it sinks into
that thick skull of yours

01:03:23.379 --> 01:03:27.782
that you draw
the sweetness out of
the Chinese cabbage?

01:03:27.851 --> 01:03:30.820
Sorry...
And this tofu.

01:03:30.887 --> 01:03:33.117
It's kinugoshi!

01:03:33.189 --> 01:03:37.649
But... But...
But the store was sold out.

01:03:37.727 --> 01:03:39.024
Aah!

01:03:40.163 --> 01:03:45.624
No... damn... darned excuses!

01:03:45.702 --> 01:03:46.634
I'm sorry.

01:03:46.703 --> 01:03:48.568
Dang useless woman.

01:03:48.638 --> 01:03:52.631
Why I ever thought
I could make
a gunfighter out of...

01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:09.219
Listen up, girl.

01:04:09.292 --> 01:04:11.852
If this were a gunfight,

01:04:11.928 --> 01:04:14.863
you wouldn't be saying
"They sold out of bullets,

01:04:14.931 --> 01:04:17.866
let's shoot beans instead,"
now could ya?

01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:22.132
That'd mean death
to me and you, wouldn't it?
Hmm, wouldn't it?

01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:26.467
That's my girl.
There you go.

01:04:26.543 --> 01:04:28.170
Never let
your guard down.

01:04:28.244 --> 01:04:29.643
Yes.

01:04:29.712 --> 01:04:32.078
The Grim Reaper himself
dwells in that pot.

01:04:32.148 --> 01:04:34.309
Don't you forget that.

01:04:36.753 --> 01:04:41.053
L... I nev...

01:04:41.124 --> 01:04:43.957
Sugar.

01:04:48.064 --> 01:04:50.032
Don't worry.

01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:53.762
The sugar helps me.

01:04:55.138 --> 01:04:56.901
Lordy lord.

01:04:56.973 --> 01:04:59.441
You ain't pregnant,
is ya?

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:08.779
I reckon it will be
a bouncing boy.

01:05:13.856 --> 01:05:16.825
Oh, heck.

01:05:18.094 --> 01:05:21.791
You mean Akira?

01:05:21.864 --> 01:05:23.331
Akira.

01:05:23.399 --> 01:05:26.596
How the lovely sound

01:05:26.669 --> 01:05:30.833
of that name
brings me back.

01:05:30.907 --> 01:05:32.875
What can I say?

01:05:32.942 --> 01:05:37.936
At the end, I am
an anime otaku at heart.

01:05:38.014 --> 01:05:39.879
What?

01:05:45.355 --> 01:05:47.949
How's my boy?

01:06:00.203 --> 01:06:03.172
Ah, so.

01:06:08.211 --> 01:06:12.545
That's why you've come
for them irons, eh?

01:06:15.885 --> 01:06:21.050
You'll tell her this for me.

01:06:29.232 --> 01:06:32.565
[Sighs]

01:06:32.635 --> 01:06:37.470
[Speaking Japanese]

01:06:44.247 --> 01:06:48.149
Life is all about goodbyes.

01:06:59.262 --> 01:07:03.392
We are in your hands!

01:07:03.466 --> 01:07:04.990
[Echoing]

01:07:26.556 --> 01:07:29.525
[Ragged breathing]

01:07:47.877 --> 01:07:51.108
I'm surprised.

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:53.307
He is still alive.

01:07:56.085 --> 01:07:58.918
I guess

01:07:58.988 --> 01:08:02.651
every man's got his own reasons

01:08:02.725 --> 01:08:07.094
for why he has to keep on living.

01:10:12.588 --> 01:10:14.681
[Sneezes]

01:10:20.029 --> 01:10:22.224
Got a cold?

01:10:22.298 --> 01:10:25.358
Don't you have one, too?

01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:54.992
Thank you.

01:10:59.402 --> 01:11:00.801
You going?

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:02.531
Huh?

01:11:02.605 --> 01:11:05.233
Yep.

01:11:05.308 --> 01:11:08.471
Going. Where to?

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.872
To settle a score.

01:11:12.949 --> 01:11:15.918
What score?

01:11:15.985 --> 01:11:18.647
The town's got nothing
to do with you.

01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:20.279
Shit just happens.

01:11:20.356 --> 01:11:23.553
That's all.

01:11:25.962 --> 01:11:30.126
So the meaning of life
is shit happens, huh?

01:11:30.199 --> 01:11:34.397
Well, I don't want to run
from the shit anymore.

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.268
Sorry, but could you
fetch the treasure for me?

01:11:40.843 --> 01:11:42.470
There is one?

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.243
Ruriko,
what about the town law?

01:11:48.317 --> 01:11:53.345
As anyone who's getting on
in years around here knows...

01:11:55.524 --> 01:11:58.459
he was chosen to guard it.

01:11:58.527 --> 01:12:01.928
That's the town law.

01:12:01.998 --> 01:12:05.729
I thought Heihachi
would be the next chosen one,

01:12:05.801 --> 01:12:08.326
but he's too weak.

01:12:08.404 --> 01:12:13.740
I reckon he was born at the wrong time
and in the wrong place.

01:12:13.809 --> 01:12:17.472
He does have a gift
for music, though.

01:12:17.546 --> 01:12:22.449
But tenderness alone
won't get you far in life.

01:12:22.518 --> 01:12:25.544
What are you fixing to do
with the treasure?

01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:29.557
Settle this
once and for all.

01:12:29.625 --> 01:12:31.593
If we lose,
they can have it.

01:12:31.661 --> 01:12:36.325
If we win,
you can have half.

01:12:36.399 --> 01:12:39.926
How about it? You game?

01:12:40.002 --> 01:12:43.665
Suits me fine.

01:12:43.739 --> 01:12:45.297
Okay, then.

01:12:53.449 --> 01:12:55.314
[High voice]
This way.

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:04.757
[Deep voice]
No. This way.

01:13:08.431 --> 01:13:12.162
[High voice]
I ain't gonna listen to you no more!

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.369
That's my line!

01:13:19.442 --> 01:13:22.240
I'll kill you!

01:13:28.884 --> 01:13:30.249
Aah!

01:13:34.056 --> 01:13:37.753
Smells like victory.

01:13:37.827 --> 01:13:41.820
Got the Mr. Gatling riding shotgun.

01:13:41.897 --> 01:13:46.425
And now, a shield.

01:13:46.502 --> 01:13:49.266
A shield?

01:13:49.338 --> 01:13:54.366
If you were fatter, it would be perfect.

01:13:58.581 --> 01:14:00.378
Hey! Hey!

01:14:00.449 --> 01:14:02.644
Hey, hold on!

01:14:02.718 --> 01:14:06.381
Come on, now! Hey! No! No!

01:14:12.461 --> 01:14:14.190
Shit.

01:14:14.263 --> 01:14:18.632
Hey, if I get taken down,

01:14:18.701 --> 01:14:21.261
will you give this
to Heihachi for me?

01:14:21.337 --> 01:14:25.273
I'll think about it
if and when you die.

01:14:25.341 --> 01:14:27.400
Hey! Hey!

01:14:29.345 --> 01:14:31.813
I'll carry the treasure for you.

01:14:31.881 --> 01:14:33.041
I'll carry the guns.

01:14:33.115 --> 01:14:35.242
And if there's
any more carrying to do,

01:14:35.317 --> 01:14:37.717
then let me do it.

01:14:37.787 --> 01:14:43.726
Well, if you ain't the most stubborn
man I ever did meet.

01:14:44.927 --> 01:14:47.225
Let him take it.

01:14:47.296 --> 01:14:51.255
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:03.474
Go, Banjo. Go!

01:15:09.118 --> 01:15:10.745
[Deep voice]
We get shot,

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.015
and you are the one's
gonna get smoked,

01:15:13.088 --> 01:15:15.352
not me.

01:15:15.424 --> 01:15:17.858
[High voice]
You die first.

01:15:17.927 --> 01:15:20.725
[Deep voice]
No, you die first!

01:15:22.464 --> 01:15:24.022
[High voice]
We die.

01:15:24.099 --> 01:15:25.930
Okay, we die.

01:15:26.001 --> 01:15:28.469
We die. I die.

01:15:28.537 --> 01:15:31.973
You die, he dies, she dies, we die.

01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:34.134
Everybody dies.

01:16:03.138 --> 01:16:07.199
Here's the treasure!

01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:11.908
Have at it, boys!

01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:15.747
Winner takes all!

01:16:19.388 --> 01:16:21.879
Hey! Look!

01:16:21.957 --> 01:16:24.425
Gold! Gold!

01:16:59.695 --> 01:17:01.128
- Here!
- This way!

01:17:30.492 --> 01:17:31.481
This way.

01:18:17.206 --> 01:18:20.471

01:18:47.069 --> 01:18:48.866

01:18:48.937 --> 01:18:51.428
Get down!

01:19:09.425 --> 01:19:11.620
You've got a new toy.

01:19:11.693 --> 01:19:14.423

01:19:20.135 --> 01:19:21.227

01:19:36.218 --> 01:19:38.186

01:20:19.161 --> 01:20:22.324
Confess thy error!

01:20:35.811 --> 01:20:38.780
This time, we win.

01:21:24.193 --> 01:21:26.787
[Gun clicks]

01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:46.907
This time...

01:22:15.611 --> 01:22:18.876
That's for the mayor.

01:22:25.587 --> 01:22:27.612
I can.

01:22:33.295 --> 01:22:35.456
I win.

01:22:35.530 --> 01:22:37.623
I win.

01:22:54.249 --> 01:22:58.549
I ain't dead...

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.680
till I beat you.

01:23:04.092 --> 01:23:06.993
This is for Akira.

01:23:13.402 --> 01:23:18.499
[Hammer clicking]

01:23:28.984 --> 01:23:31.248

01:23:44.833 --> 01:23:47.358
It's mine.

01:23:57.646 --> 01:23:59.910
It's all ours!

01:24:12.027 --> 01:24:13.585
[Gunshot]

01:24:47.763 --> 01:24:49.162

01:24:50.999 --> 01:24:52.227

01:24:53.935 --> 01:24:54.867
you're...

01:24:54.936 --> 01:24:56.836
Don't say it.

01:25:03.979 --> 01:25:09.144
No one in the world
ever saved Benten's life.

01:25:10.719 --> 01:25:14.815
Except for you.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.123
Nope.

01:25:23.665 --> 01:25:24.791
You...

01:25:26.368 --> 01:25:30.361

01:26:16.117 --> 01:26:18.881
I'm not...

01:26:18.954 --> 01:26:20.819
dead...

01:26:23.625 --> 01:26:25.820
yet.

01:28:03.058 --> 01:28:06.425
Now this...

01:28:06.494 --> 01:28:09.622
[sighs]

01:28:09.698 --> 01:28:12.690
Is what I call class.

01:28:23.044 --> 01:28:28.778
So that old granny
was Bloody Benten, eh?

01:28:31.419 --> 01:28:34.252
I'm glad I came here.

01:28:34.322 --> 01:28:38.281
Hell, I'm glad I was born.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:42.296
Finally, with a worthy opponent,

01:28:42.364 --> 01:28:46.323
I can risk my life to the death.

01:29:21.336 --> 01:29:22.928
<i>Victory...</i>

01:29:24.773 --> 01:29:26.240
or death!

01:31:45.713 --> 01:31:48.978
That's plenty for me.

01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:52.178
You keep the rest.

01:31:54.689 --> 01:31:57.715
Just do me one thing.

01:31:57.792 --> 01:32:00.192
Tend to the roses for me.

01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:09.697
But when it doesn't feel right,

01:32:09.771 --> 01:32:13.673
you can stop.

01:32:13.741 --> 01:32:16.107
Now you've got money,

01:32:16.177 --> 01:32:20.204
you've got a gun,

01:32:20.281 --> 01:32:23.409
and the roses, too.

01:32:26.287 --> 01:32:29.120
Heihachi,

01:32:29.190 --> 01:32:30.589

no matter what the times may be,

01:32:37.098 --> 01:32:39.794
no matter where you are,

01:32:39.868 --> 01:32:45.636
what matters is you
and how you deal with this world.

01:32:48.076 --> 01:32:53.776
And there ain't no running from it.

01:33:04.759 --> 01:33:06.124
Don't run.

01:33:08.129 --> 01:33:10.563
Decide for yourself

01:33:10.632 --> 01:33:12.497
what tomorrow's gonna be.
