00:19.753 --> 00:21.622
(car door opens)

00:45.246 --> 00:47.315
*

00:59.593 --> 01:01.829
(phone ringing)

01:05.266 --> 01:07.401
Hey.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.769
(chuckles)

01:08.802 --> 01:11.205
Tomorrow.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.373
After the interview.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.743
It will all be done
by then, and...

01:15.776 --> 01:17.511
we can go on as planned.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.214
Now, do they know I'm here?

01:21.649 --> 01:22.750
(man grunts)

01:22.783 --> 01:23.784
(blade tinging)

01:23.817 --> 01:25.886
(both grunting)

01:25.919 --> 01:28.722
MAN (over phone):
Hello? Saida?

01:28.756 --> 01:30.258
Saida?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.626
Saida? Saida?!

01:32.660 --> 01:34.562
(emitting static)

01:34.595 --> 01:38.166
DON: Oh! Test that man
for steroid use.

01:38.199 --> 01:42.270
Dad, analysis of classic Sudoku

01:42.303 --> 01:43.704
has revealed six
and a half sextillion

01:43.737 --> 01:46.374
possible completed grids,
and five and a half billion

01:46.407 --> 01:48.576
essentially different grids.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.244
but none of that
is gonna help me

01:50.278 --> 01:51.812
with this particular
problem I have.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.514
Well, you could also
save time

01:53.547 --> 01:56.184
by using a program
to solve the puzzle.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.585
Charlie, the object
of doing the puzzle

01:57.618 --> 01:59.553
is to relax by wasting time.

01:59.587 --> 02:02.456
Using a solution program
is relaxing for some people.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.326
Charlie, are we still
on for lunch tomorrow?

02:05.359 --> 02:07.628
I was meaning to tell you,
I need to cancel,

02:07.661 --> 02:10.698
'cause I have
an appointment tomorrow.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.534
Well, not necessarily
an appointment.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.269
Might we say a date?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.638
Susan Berry is in town.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.939
Ah.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.274
So, uh, we'll just reschedule,

02:20.308 --> 02:21.575
-all right?
-Okay.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.843
DON:
Susan Berry?

02:22.876 --> 02:23.777
Wait, she lives
in London, right.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.480
She does;
she's a neuroscientist there.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.216
-(phone rings)
-ALAN: So what's she doing

02:28.249 --> 02:29.217
in Los Angeles?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.751
She's here on her book tour.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.720
Book's called
The Neurology of Ecstasy.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.955
-Eppes. -Oh, the old nucleus
accumbens, eh?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.457
CHARLIE:
That's right,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.826
and she's invited me
to a reading on campus.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.893
On my way.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.362
Guys, I got to go to work,

02:41.395 --> 02:42.596
so say hi to Susan for me.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.198
You got it.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.366
I'll see you
guys later.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.500
-Make sure you tell me
the score. -Okay.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.269
-Dad, later.
-Bye.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.737
Sounds like you're still
carrying a torch for this woman.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.373
Not at all-- you know,
we're talking years ago.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.707
I mean, I know...

02:53.741 --> 02:55.643
I don't... we're talking...

02:55.676 --> 02:56.977
What are
we talking?

02:57.010 --> 02:57.745
What happened?

02:57.778 --> 02:58.746
Uh...

02:58.779 --> 03:02.250
Careers, long distance.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.752
It'll be great seeing her again.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.756
Definitely...

03:08.789 --> 03:10.424
nine, nine, nine.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.394
Back off, Rainman.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.296
Hey.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.331
Victim's an
Iraqi national.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.300
She's a lawyer
named Saida Kafaji.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.701
She was here in
L.A. participating

03:20.734 --> 03:22.436
in a documentary
about women's rights

03:22.470 --> 03:24.238
in Muslim countries.

03:24.272 --> 03:27.408
Got boot prints in
the dirt over here.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.643
He must have jumped out
right as she was coming around.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.445
(indistinct
radio transmission)

03:31.479 --> 03:33.781
-(camera clicks)
-No sign of the weapon yet.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.450
(camera clicks)

03:36.484 --> 03:37.518
She fought him.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.586
Well, not for long.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.788
Throat was cut
right to the spine.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.424
No hesitation marks,
looks professional.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.659
-It ain't wrong place, wrong
time, huh? -No, I think

03:45.693 --> 03:47.861
somebody just didn't want her
making that documentary.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.698
I want you to cover her body.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.965
Don, this is
Nasreen Kafaji.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.801
the victim's cousin.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.469
She lives here,
victim was staying with her.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.004
Listen...

03:57.037 --> 03:57.971
Please, cover her body!

03:58.005 --> 04:00.341
I have been asking
for an hour!

04:00.374 --> 04:01.875
Okay, okay, Ms. Kafaji,

04:01.909 --> 04:03.611
we need to
collect evidence.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.679
Now, are you the one
who found her here?

04:05.713 --> 04:08.482
A neighbor's
dog found her.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.617
(indistinct
radio transmission)

04:09.650 --> 04:11.752
Oh, God.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.621
-I'm terribly sorry for your
loss... -(sniffles)

04:13.654 --> 04:15.689
...but we need to
interview you.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.991
Not until you cover
her body!

04:20.394 --> 04:22.663
She's been avoiding
our questions since we got here.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.565
Well, make sure she
doesn't go anywhere.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.300
All right.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.737
Tommy, let's get a
sheet over her, huh?!

04:32.540 --> 04:35.376
We all use math every day,

04:35.409 --> 04:36.510
to predict weather,

04:36.544 --> 04:38.779
to tell time,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.881
to handle money.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.320
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

04:46.354 --> 04:50.023
It's logic...

04:50.057 --> 04:52.693
rationality.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.595
It's using your mind

04:54.628 --> 04:57.665
to solve the biggest mysteries
we know.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.073
MEGAN:
The victim was an Iraqi citizen

05:06.106 --> 05:07.708
here on a work visa

05:07.741 --> 05:09.076
sponsored by the Women
For Peace and Justice.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.511
They're making
a documentary.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.480
-She was an activist?
-Definitely.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.814
There were death
threats against her

05:13.847 --> 05:15.883
by an extremist
cleric in Baghdad.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.918
-A fatwa?
-Not officially.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.787
The cleric who threatened
her is so extreme

05:19.820 --> 05:21.489
the other ayatollahs want
nothing to do with him.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.956
Officially, maybe, they want
nothing to do with him,

05:22.990 --> 05:24.858
but unofficially...

05:24.892 --> 05:27.661
WOMAN (over TV): If you can
imagine, women had more rights

05:27.695 --> 05:30.398
under Saddam than with
these extremist clerics.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.566
Iraq is a modern nation.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.536
I am a Muslim, a lawyer,
a feminist,

05:35.569 --> 05:37.505
and a patriot for Iraq--
should I be beaten

05:37.538 --> 05:39.673
because of a dress code?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.942
Stoned to death
for saying what I think?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.043
DON:
That was taped yesterday

05:43.076 --> 05:44.412
in Altadena two hours

05:44.445 --> 05:46.079
before she was killed.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.616
Saida Kafaji was organizing
Muslim women internationally,

05:48.649 --> 05:50.651
-gaining political momentum.
-COLBY: In other words,

05:50.684 --> 05:51.685
becoming a threat.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.020
DON:
Guys, meet Agent Allawi

05:53.053 --> 05:54.955
from Immigration and Customs.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.558
ALLAWI:
Or as we like to call it-- ICE.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.527
Now, your victim had
an ongoing fight in the press

05:59.560 --> 06:00.961
with radical Shiite cleric,

06:00.994 --> 06:02.563
Mustapha al-Badr.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.964
Wouldn't it be
more convenient

06:03.997 --> 06:04.898
to kill her over there?

06:04.932 --> 06:06.767
I mean, why do it
in the United States?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.569
It's possible she was fleeing,
and they pursued her.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.937
MEGAN:
Or they wanted to send a message

06:09.970 --> 06:11.705
that the West isn't safe
for women.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.707
-Mm-hmm.
-And there's a mosque

06:13.741 --> 06:15.943
right here in L.A.,
and the sheik here on the left

06:15.976 --> 06:18.178
has a strong connection
to al-Badr and Islamic radicals

06:18.211 --> 06:19.513
living in California,

06:19.547 --> 06:20.648
but there's no way

06:20.681 --> 06:22.082
of knowing
who's capable of murder.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.984
I may very well

06:24.017 --> 06:27.120
be able to determine
who's ready to commit murder.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.657
Logistic regression models,

06:29.690 --> 06:32.460
they can be used to estimate
the probabilities

06:32.493 --> 06:34.194
of things like
lightning striking,

06:34.227 --> 06:36.564
and I can apply them
to these circumstances.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.433
Charlie, just break it down
for the guy.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.668
(clears throat):
For a bolt of lightning...

06:40.701 --> 06:43.737
clouds must have certain
internal conditions--

06:43.771 --> 06:47.675
moisture, turbulence,
negative electrical charges.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.711
Similarly, an individual's
internal conditions--

06:50.744 --> 06:53.881
violent tendencies,
religious extremism,

06:53.914 --> 06:56.116
and history with women
can be quantified.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.152
Now, I cross that inner data
with external conditions--

06:59.186 --> 07:02.723
loyalty to a radical cleric,
geographic location,

07:02.756 --> 07:04.992
and financial pressure,
and we see

07:05.025 --> 07:07.628
- where the lightning strikes.
-(thunder rumbles)

07:07.661 --> 07:11.632
What I need is data on Islamic
radicals living in California,

07:11.665 --> 07:13.734
as well as on the
recent arrivals.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.835
-ALLAWI: What kindof data?
-Colby.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.738
Data on attacks by radicals
in the Unites States,

07:17.771 --> 07:18.772
and well as in other countries.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.773
I also need

07:19.807 --> 07:22.576
public information, like
arrests, age, ethnicity,

07:22.610 --> 07:24.144
religion,
length of time

07:24.177 --> 07:25.145
in the United States.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.179
Good.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.115
I'll interview the cousin--
you speak Arabic?

07:28.148 --> 07:29.249
So why don't you
try leaning

07:29.282 --> 07:31.619
-on that sheik you told us
about? -Why don't I do it?

07:31.652 --> 07:33.654
Let's see how he responds
to a woman.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.988
Yeah, all right,
that's a good idea.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.123
You can do that together.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.525
I'll set up surveillance.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.458
Actually, ICE has him
under surveillance.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.927
Get me those tapes,
and we'll check them

07:39.960 --> 07:41.128
against anything Charlie
comes up with.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.963
And, Colby, why don't you
take the cell phone

07:42.996 --> 07:44.197
and the boot prints,
all right?

07:44.231 --> 07:45.232
Yeah, you got it, Don.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.902
That's a lot of poetry.

07:48.936 --> 07:52.072
I'm a professor
of Arabic poetry at UCLA.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.944
I need my cousin's body back.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.514
In Islam, we bury our dead
within two days.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.182
We have to do an autopsy;
there's no way around it.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.150
I can promise you this:

08:03.183 --> 08:06.754
I'll get her back to you
as soon as possible.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.689
Can you tell me a little
about her?

08:08.722 --> 08:10.558
I don't know.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.859
She was out to change the world.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.961
The death threats
just spurred her on.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.296
She was fearless, even as a kid.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.566
-You two grew up together?
-Yeah, my family left Iraq

08:18.599 --> 08:20.233
during the first Gulf War.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.769
We were like sisters as kids.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.572
You think her enemies in Iraq
are responsible?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.574
I don't know
who is responsible.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.075
She provoked
a lot of people.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.544
Can you give me a few names?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.550
MEGAN:
So, you're sure this Imam

08:36.584 --> 08:37.851
has connections
to Iraq?

08:37.885 --> 08:41.689
Iraq, Iran,
Saudi Arabia, Syria...

08:41.722 --> 08:43.824
Islamic radicalism
in Southern California

08:43.857 --> 08:46.259
pretty much runs
through this mosque.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.729
ALLAWI:
Imam, assalamu alaikum.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.732
Alaikum assalamu.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.602
(continues in Arabic)

08:54.635 --> 08:57.070
I'm Special Agent Reeves,

08:57.104 --> 09:00.073
with the FBI.

09:00.107 --> 09:03.877
We've come to speak with you
about Saida Kafaji.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.145
Do you know
who she is?

09:05.178 --> 09:08.749
I do... a reckless young woman.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.152
So you condoned the death
threats against her?

09:12.185 --> 09:14.021
I know nothing about that.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.823
But you do
have followers

09:15.856 --> 09:18.726
of Mustapha al-Badr
in this mosque?

09:18.759 --> 09:22.362
Any sincere Muslim
can come here.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.932
Saida Kafaji was
a sincere Muslim.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.668
Do you feel
any obligation

09:27.701 --> 09:28.902
towards her?

09:28.936 --> 09:31.304
Why do you assume

09:31.338 --> 09:33.974
I know anything
about her killing?

09:34.007 --> 09:37.611
I know of no hatred
aimed toward Saida.

09:37.645 --> 09:40.213
Would you tell me
if you did?

09:42.149 --> 09:44.251
(speaking Arabic)

09:46.153 --> 09:48.321
Assalamu alaikum.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.224
ALLAWI:
Alaikum assalamu.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.062
Yeah.

09:55.095 --> 10:00.634
Give me some good, old-fashioned
redneck chauvinism any day.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.936
CHARLIE:
Well, it actually ends up being
a great logistics problem

10:02.970 --> 10:04.772
for the students to work on.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.206
Yeah, we obviously
just won't give them

10:06.239 --> 10:08.175
any of the classified
information.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.376
Okay, well, I'll get volunteers.

10:09.409 --> 10:13.814
Thanks, Amita, and, uh... yeah,
I'll be back in like a...

10:13.847 --> 10:16.149
like a half hour, okay?

10:16.183 --> 10:17.651
Okay.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.152
"The nucleus accumbens,

10:19.186 --> 10:22.089
"a tiny speck
deep in the middle of the brain,

10:22.122 --> 10:25.225
"is the epicenter of ecstasy,
so the insight

10:25.258 --> 10:29.763
"of the neurology of ecstasy
is that the high of heroin,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.899
"the rapture of orgasm,
the smell of money,

10:31.932 --> 10:34.802
"are ultimately nothing
but trickles of a chemical

10:34.835 --> 10:35.836
"deep inside the...

10:35.869 --> 10:38.438
"...brain onto a tiny speck

10:38.471 --> 10:41.909
"so ancient that we share
its basic circuitry

10:41.942 --> 10:43.343
with every living creature."

10:43.376 --> 10:47.047
So for a good time,
buy my book.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.449
(laughter)

10:49.482 --> 10:50.984
Excuse me one moment.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.886
I will be back to
sign books and chat.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.021
Just one minute.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.088
-Hello.
-Hey.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.690
-How's it going?
-Hi.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.393
You look exactly the same.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.394
(chuckles)

11:01.428 --> 11:02.395
You look no different.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.764
How's that at all possible?

11:03.797 --> 11:05.999
Are you defying
certain laws of physics?

11:06.033 --> 11:07.034
No, no.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.268
-No. You sure?
-Look at you--

11:08.301 --> 11:09.703
all hip and
distinguished,

11:09.737 --> 11:10.704
Dr. Eppes.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.739
Driving these undergrads mad?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.273
Sure. It's a constant struggle.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.875
Mm.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.110
I have to work this
crowd, and then

11:17.144 --> 11:18.311
I have to do an interview,

11:18.345 --> 11:19.880
and then I have dinner
with my publishers.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.414
-Can we get a drink after that?
-Yeah.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.851
-You're gonna lose people.
We got to go. -Okay.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.152
I was thinking
dinner tomorrow night.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.987
I'll cook
something for you.

11:27.020 --> 11:27.988
You'll cook?

11:28.021 --> 11:28.989
Yeah.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.090
I'll clear the schedule.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.860
-It's great seeing you.
-It's nice to see you, too.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.828
Go to go. I've
missed you.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.896
(laughs)

11:35.929 --> 11:37.164
SUSAN:
Hi.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.268
-Don.
-Hey.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.502
Anything with
the cell phone?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.305
Yeah, it looks like she was
on a call when she was killed.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.174
We traced it to a motel
in Hermosa Beach,

11:47.207 --> 11:48.341
but it was
a dead end.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.509
All right.
I got some names

11:49.542 --> 11:51.044
from the cousin--
people who spoke out

11:51.078 --> 11:51.979
against Kafaji's organization.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.247
-I could use help running those
down. -Okay.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.316
Listen, Don, we found a
knife in a storm drain

11:56.349 --> 11:58.752
about a block and a half
away from the crime scene.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.120
Sent it off
for a blood

12:00.153 --> 12:02.255
and a DNA match, but
the size of the blade,

12:02.289 --> 12:03.256
the shape of it--

12:03.290 --> 12:05.325
I'm pretty sure we have
the murder weapon here.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.426
All right, so?

12:06.459 --> 12:07.427
Here's the thing.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.529
Boot prints
from the scene

12:09.562 --> 12:10.931
and now this knife--

12:10.964 --> 12:13.466
they're both military issue...

12:13.500 --> 12:15.202
American military issue.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.870
You're kidding.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.171
Same stuff we used
in Afghanistan.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.207
Same thing that's being
used in Iraq right now.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.475
But the thing is,
you can also buy it

12:22.509 --> 12:24.044
in any Army
surplus store.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.979
The American military
would never do this.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.181
Yeah, these are
crazy times, Colby.

12:36.189 --> 12:40.327
Does Saida have any connections
to the American military?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.895
I don't know.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.263
Really?

12:43.296 --> 12:44.832
She had a whole
life in Iraq,

12:44.865 --> 12:46.499
a life I didn't know
anything about.

12:46.533 --> 12:50.070
Nasreen, look, I think there's
something you're not telling me.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.043
You don't understand.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.444
What I don't understand is
why would you

12:57.477 --> 12:59.146
withhold information
that would help us capture

12:59.179 --> 13:00.213
the guy that killed her?

13:00.247 --> 13:01.048
Why would you do that?

13:01.081 --> 13:03.383
She was killed right
here in my garden.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.251
Okay, all right.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.019
I'll put a 24-hour guard
on your door,

13:06.053 --> 13:07.520
I will give you an escort
wherever you go.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.555
We can protect you.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.490
Now, I know
she was a radical.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.492
I just don't know
what she had to do

13:12.525 --> 13:15.996
with our military.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.832
She was helping to prosecute
cases in Basra.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.934
She was working
with the Americans.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.403
A few weeks ago...

13:23.436 --> 13:25.205
she sent me this.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.879
What does it say?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.546
It says that an American soldier

13:33.580 --> 13:35.883
is going to accompany her
from Basra

13:35.916 --> 13:37.985
on March 27.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.291
Colby, where are you?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.426
I'm over here at Los Alamitos.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.895
I got a buddy from Afghanistan

13:47.928 --> 13:49.296
who works
Criminal Investigations here.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.198
Saida Kafaji had an Army escort

13:51.231 --> 13:52.432
when she left Basra,
March 27.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.502
See if you can find out who her
contact was there, would you?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.104
Okay, sure.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.439
Yeah, I'll see
what I can do, Don.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.942
Look like crap
in a suit, C.G.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.978
Should have stayed in the man's
Army, wear camis to work.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.447
Yeah, well, while you're out
here in the middle of nowhere,

14:07.480 --> 14:08.615
I work in civilization.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.284
Did you get a chance to look
into Saida Kafaji for me?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.055
She was a piece of work.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.925
Spoke out against
pretty much everybody.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.927
Player?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.128
Hard to say.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.229
Why?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.096
File's classified.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.166
She has a military
intelligence file?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.335
And it's classified.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.904
Well, you can get
into it, right?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.205
Uh-uh.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.541
FBI wants to see it,
you got to do it officially.

14:34.574 --> 14:38.678
Look, I have U.S. Army boot
prints at the crime scene.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.181
The murder weapon was a
six-inch battle knife.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.083
You really want me
to get into this officially?

14:43.116 --> 14:45.085
Anybody can buy
a knife like that.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.319
That's what I thought, too,

14:46.353 --> 14:48.155
till I heard she had
a classified file.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.992
I can give you a list

14:52.025 --> 14:54.061
of CID personnel
she worked with in Basra.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.495
But that is all

14:55.528 --> 14:57.064
I can give you.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.232
-It's a start.
-Come on,

14:59.266 --> 15:00.633
let's go choke down
some of my coffee.

15:02.535 --> 15:06.106
The military aspect
complicates the politics

15:06.139 --> 15:08.041
and therefore the math,
doesn't it?

15:08.075 --> 15:10.577
More information, the better,
a problem like this.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.646
So we'll have these results
in a couple of hours.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.116
Great. I'm gonna need
to cross-reference my findings

15:16.149 --> 15:17.650
with the list
you all come up with.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.053
Okay, well, you'll input,
and then we'll recalculate.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.388
Great. That's great.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.522
(knocking)

15:22.555 --> 15:23.656
Hey.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.325
What's going...

15:25.358 --> 15:27.127
I'm sorry to interrupt.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.328
You know,
we're meeting later tonight?

15:28.361 --> 15:29.296
I do. This is the thing.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.663
I have back-to-back interviews
all evening

15:30.697 --> 15:32.632
with the L.A. Times
Book Review

15:32.665 --> 15:35.002
and, um, Syzygy.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.403
I don't know.
One's for sales,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.071
-one's for street cred.
-Look at you.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.072
So I was wondering

15:39.106 --> 15:40.640
if you could get away now.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.009
Actually, I can't.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.210
But you know what?

15:43.243 --> 15:44.744
Just come with me.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.945
-Okay.
-Yeah.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.681
No, not at all.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.351
Did she said "street cred"?

15:51.384 --> 15:53.086
Who is that?

15:53.120 --> 15:56.089
My hunch is, that's
the old girlfriend, Susan Berry.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.225
(laughs)

15:58.258 --> 15:59.359
I've heard of her.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.460
Yeah, they lived together

16:00.493 --> 16:01.461
for nearly two years.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.163
His very own Berry's Phase.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.236
She's pretty.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.139
All right,
where were we?

16:12.172 --> 16:13.506
You didn't want
to go with her?

16:13.540 --> 16:14.541
Huh? No, we're meeting
later tonight.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.411
And I've got to work
on these boot prints.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.612
Yeah, boot prints.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.116
Charlie, are you familiar with
the work of Petr Hlavacek?

16:23.150 --> 16:24.617
Mm.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.119
He's this obsessed Czech,

16:26.153 --> 16:28.088
and from a shoe
or shoe print,

16:28.121 --> 16:30.290
he can read a person's height,
weight, physical ailments.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.259
-Physical ailments?
-Yeah.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.395
He diagnosed syphilis in
Albrecht von Wallenstein

16:35.428 --> 16:37.597
from his boots alone.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.599
(helicopter blades thumping)

16:39.632 --> 16:41.168
We need official
contact with the Army.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.670
Get this: they have a classified
file on Saida Kafaji.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.372
We can't get into it
any other way.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.074
All right. I'll talk to Don.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.275
And what about her cases?

16:48.308 --> 16:50.143
We need higher clearance
for that, too.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.811
All I have so far is a list

16:51.844 --> 16:53.813
of CI officers
that were in Basra.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.283
One of them, Lieutenant
Joseph Karnes, he left Iraq

16:56.316 --> 16:58.551
in a military transport
the same day as our victim.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.752
And where is he now?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.555
Check this out.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.224
He's AWOL.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.227
He's been AWOL since
the day of her murder.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.761
Looks like we have ourselves
a suspect.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.937
Karnes left Basra
on March 27.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.540
He was due back yesterday,
and nobody's heard from him.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.442
He's been in Iraq
for 18 months,

17:22.475 --> 17:24.344
and he works
in Criminal Investigations.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.646
He could be a witness
in one of Saida Kafaji's cases,

17:26.679 --> 17:28.715
or he could have been sent here
to investigate her.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.284
All I know is that whatever
he was doing for the Army,

17:31.318 --> 17:32.385
he's not doing it anymore.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.487
Maybe they put him in the wind
for a job well done.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.722
If they want to drop him
off the map,

17:35.755 --> 17:36.856
they wouldn't
designate him AWOL.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.159
That means they're
looking for him, too.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.560
Well, I'm not getting
any cooperation from them.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.828
They want to know
what we got.

17:41.861 --> 17:42.929
My buddy was surprised

17:42.962 --> 17:44.731
when he heard about
the boot prints and the knife.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.832
I don't think he knew

17:45.865 --> 17:47.334
-what to make of it.
-Somebody does.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.668
Can your buddy help us any more?

17:48.701 --> 17:49.669
No. They shut him down.

17:49.702 --> 17:50.670
Well, then, Megan,

17:50.703 --> 17:51.704
you should
get with Allawi

17:51.738 --> 17:52.705
before they
shut him down, too.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.607
We want to know if any Iraqis
in California

17:54.641 --> 17:55.608
are involved in her case--

17:55.642 --> 17:57.477
witnesses to war crimes,

17:57.510 --> 17:59.246
fugitives from prosecution,
that sort of thing, right?

17:59.279 --> 18:00.113
On my way.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.614
Can we get this information
to Charlie?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.116
Where is Charlie anyway?

18:07.387 --> 18:08.521
Was delicious.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.622
CHARLIE:
Thank you.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.592
You're a good cook, Charlie.
When did that happen?

18:12.625 --> 18:13.693
I'm glad you liked it.

18:13.726 --> 18:14.761
It's steak.
It's pretty simple.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.529
Still, it's good.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.465
Look at you,
living in this house.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.699
-I own this house.
-Okay.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.834
Yeah, let's make that
distinction, I own it.

18:21.868 --> 18:26.139
Isn't it weird how
we're suddenly just grownups?

18:26.173 --> 18:28.141
Age has never really
meant much to me.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.142
I don't know.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.178
I don't feel any different
than when I was...

18:31.211 --> 18:32.412
Twenty-one.

18:35.648 --> 18:39.486
I actually have been meaning
to mention something to you.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.454
I've been working
on something

18:41.488 --> 18:44.457
called Cognitive
Emergence Theory.

18:44.491 --> 18:49.729
And it's the math
of neurons creating...

18:49.762 --> 18:52.632
well, creating consciousness.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.301
That's amazing.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.368
You think so?

18:55.402 --> 18:56.803
Yeah, yeah,
that's amazing, Charlie.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.305
Where are you
getting your data from?

18:58.338 --> 19:00.273
-Professor Quartz in
Neuroscience here. -Yeah.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.908
-You remember?
-Uh-huh.

19:01.941 --> 19:05.645
And I'm wondering,
how do you quantify

19:05.678 --> 19:09.682
this state of grace you
so vividly describe in the book?

19:09.716 --> 19:12.619
E.E.G.'s...

19:12.652 --> 19:14.554
testimony, observation.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.888
Observation and testimony.

19:15.922 --> 19:16.989
Mm-hmm.

19:17.023 --> 19:20.527
Yeah, the patient describes
his or her experience.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.230
So the brain
biochemistry releases

19:23.263 --> 19:25.432
simultaneous feelings
of fear

19:25.465 --> 19:29.569
and joy and loss of self--

19:29.602 --> 19:31.704
or at least a blurring
of the boundaries

19:31.738 --> 19:35.475
between self and other.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.978
Which, in turn,
results in a kind of awe.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.414
I can see that.

19:45.785 --> 19:46.886
(door opens)

19:46.919 --> 19:47.887
ALAN:
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.689
I, uh...

19:49.722 --> 19:51.224
Alan?

19:51.258 --> 19:52.292
ALAN:
My game got canceled.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.426
I, uh, I didn't realize...

19:53.460 --> 19:54.427
Remember Susan?

19:54.461 --> 19:55.628
Hi, nice to see
you again.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.829
You, too, yeah.

19:56.863 --> 19:57.864
Hi. Okay, great.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.968
I'll be in there.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.770
Actually, up there.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.238
See you later.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.239
ALAN:
Okay.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.841
So, um, okay.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.511
(chuckles)

20:11.544 --> 20:14.013
I haven't aged much since 21.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.248
You live with your dad.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.649
-He lives with me.
-Uh-huh.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.285
-No, seriously.
-Whatever.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.819
-(laughs)
-I can't kick him out, you know?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.921
LARRY:
Something is missing.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.690
According to the crime report,

20:23.723 --> 20:25.958
the killer took
four steps to the west,

20:25.992 --> 20:28.761
he pivots, he takes
three steps to the east.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.263
He was pacing.

20:30.297 --> 20:33.833
He was pacing,
then he hears her approach...

20:33.866 --> 20:36.569
She was on a cell phone, so
he waited for her to pass.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.470
Right, right.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.973
And then he just,
he leaps from his lair.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.443
Larry...

20:43.476 --> 20:45.745
I don't think
he leapt from a lair.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.982
And certainly, his knife
was not in the air like this.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.652
He pulled her into the bushes
from behind and cut her throat

20:52.685 --> 20:53.853
in and out like that.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.322
Okay.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.989
They teach you
that at Quantico?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.958
Your taxpayer dollars
at work.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.927
If I could, please.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.062
Do we know how tall
this guy was?

21:03.095 --> 21:07.534
Yeah, he was six-one, 190
pounds with a shoe size of 11,

21:07.567 --> 21:09.669
which matches the prints
we found at the scene.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.304
Well, now,
that's very interesting,

21:11.338 --> 21:12.605
and I'll tell you why.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.874
Because these boot prints
were lifted

21:14.907 --> 21:18.711
from the gardening soil
behind the bushes.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.847
And given the depth of this,

21:20.880 --> 21:23.950
I'd say we're
looking at somebody

21:23.983 --> 21:25.985
who's less than 190.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.488
170, perhaps.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.489
Could Karnes have lost weight?

21:29.522 --> 21:30.823
I guess, yeah.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.660
And given the distance
between these steps...

21:33.693 --> 21:36.663
No, this is a person

21:36.696 --> 21:38.898
maybe five-nine

21:38.931 --> 21:43.870
with a hip width of,
I'm gonna say, 16 inches.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.638
Well, how accurate
do you think this thing is?

21:45.672 --> 21:48.107
My math? It's very accurate.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.445
But nevertheless,
something liminal hovers,

21:52.479 --> 21:54.381
which I cannot quite...

21:54.414 --> 21:55.615
No.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.849
It's just one of those.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.117
It will not be forced.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.752
If you'll excuse me,

21:59.786 --> 22:02.922
my brain requires
a change of environment.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.525
I'm just gonna go ahead
and use your phone,

22:05.558 --> 22:07.360
if you have one in here.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.995
Colby, I just
located Allawi.

22:09.028 --> 22:11.531
Let me call you back
in a few minutes.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.833
Hey, I'm sorry to pull you
out of the symphony.

22:13.866 --> 22:14.867
You kidding me?

22:14.901 --> 22:16.536
My wife drags me
to this stuff.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.471
I'm more of a Radiohead
kind of guy.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.472
(laughs)

22:19.506 --> 22:20.440
So what's up?

22:20.473 --> 22:22.709
Saida Kafaji was working
for the U.S. military

22:22.742 --> 22:24.677
in Basra
as a lawyer.

22:24.711 --> 22:25.878
Any idea
what kind of cases

22:25.912 --> 22:26.813
she'd be working on?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.648
What do you mean
"working with the military"?

22:28.681 --> 22:31.017
I don't really know.
They won't say.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.952
Maybe something
for the War Tribunal,

22:32.985 --> 22:35.622
involving Republican Guard
war atrocities?

22:35.655 --> 22:38.658
I mean, those bastards are
hiding out all over the world.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.393
I mean, what
kind of information

22:40.427 --> 22:41.394
could she have
stumbled upon

22:41.428 --> 22:44.564
that the army would
want to keep her quiet?

22:44.597 --> 22:45.832
What do you have?

22:45.865 --> 22:49.836
I have a military issued weapon,
and a boot print on the scene,

22:49.869 --> 22:51.704
and her army handler
who arrived the same day

22:51.738 --> 22:53.105
is now AWOL.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.974
She could have stumbled
onto something

22:55.007 --> 22:56.175
she wasn't supposed to see.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.810
Now, my guys have access,

22:57.844 --> 22:59.111
we can run down
her military cases,

22:59.145 --> 23:00.447
see what she was up to.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.882
I got some Radiohead
in the car.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.818
(crickets chirping)

23:35.214 --> 23:36.583
Eureka.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.652
Oh, my word, eureka!

23:40.487 --> 23:42.455
Archimedes.

23:42.489 --> 23:45.858
It's Archimedes all over again!

23:45.892 --> 23:48.094
Archimedes!

23:48.127 --> 23:50.196
Gold is denser
than silver,

23:50.229 --> 23:52.131
and thusly
Archimedes proved

23:52.164 --> 23:54.133
the crown was a fake
in the bathtub.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.102
Let me call you right back.

23:56.135 --> 24:00.940
But don't be fooled... because
this fraud has nothing to do

24:00.973 --> 24:04.611
with the Principle of
Buoyancy or the Law of Levers.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.614
No, it's simply a poetic leap,
a moment of insight.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.615
"Eureka."

24:08.648 --> 24:09.682
Precisely.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.751
You know, since water is
so conducive to thinking,

24:11.784 --> 24:13.853
it's a wonder we don't have
classes in swimming pools.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.221
What's a fraud?

24:15.254 --> 24:18.090
Leg length discrepancy.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.892
But, to
demonstrate,

24:19.926 --> 24:23.029
I'm going to have
to put on the boots.

24:23.062 --> 24:26.866
Oh, water,
such a magical element.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.168
Now, the person
who made these prints

24:29.201 --> 24:31.571
has one leg slightly shorter
than the other.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.673
Not really noticeable,

24:33.706 --> 24:38.811
but just enough to cause him
to supinate with his right leg--

24:38.845 --> 24:42.181
which puts pressure on
the outside of the print--

24:42.214 --> 24:46.018
and to pronate with his left
foot, the longer limb,

24:46.052 --> 24:48.120
which puts pressure on
the insi of the print.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.623
Wait a minute, he'd never
get into the military.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.024
This is not Joe Karnes.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.626
He's being framed.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.594
Good job, doc.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.531
I'm actually feeling
a little chilly.

24:58.565 --> 25:01.267
Now where have I
left my clothing?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.303
(door opening)

25:04.336 --> 25:06.038
-Yeah?
-Yeah, it's an amazing view.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.540
-Wow.
-Come on in.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.545
-Yeah, this is a really nice
view. -Beautiful, right?

25:12.579 --> 25:14.080
Yeah.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.048
-It's not bad.
-(drops bag)

25:18.818 --> 25:21.087
*

25:28.060 --> 25:30.296
Ooh, it's funny.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.835
What is?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.303
How familiar you feel.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.338
*

25:39.371 --> 25:45.044
It's unexpected.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.580
Disconcerting.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.215
Why did we break up?

25:49.248 --> 25:51.283
I, uh...

25:51.317 --> 25:54.787
I don't remember.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.589
Oh!

25:56.623 --> 25:58.190
I have missed you.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.660
*

26:14.941 --> 26:15.842
What are you doing here?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.109
The man who accompanied
Saida to America

26:17.143 --> 26:18.044
is named Joseph Karnes,

26:18.077 --> 26:19.912
he's a lieutenant in
Criminal Investigations.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.248
I need to know specifically
what she was working on

26:22.281 --> 26:24.250
and who she was investigating,
and I need to know now!

26:24.283 --> 26:27.253
Okay, will you please
keep your voice down? Come in.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.321
You said she
told you everything.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.923
What, there was
no mention of him?

26:30.957 --> 26:31.958
It's not what you think.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.026
What, you had something
to do with her death?

26:34.060 --> 26:36.028
-No, why would you say that?
-(tea kettle whistling)

26:36.062 --> 26:37.730
Because you have been
holding something from me

26:37.764 --> 26:38.931
from the get-go,
all right?

26:38.965 --> 26:40.733
I know it,
I can tell!

26:40.767 --> 26:42.635
Now, people's lives could be
in danger here, Nasreen,

26:42.669 --> 26:43.636
anyone who helped her,

26:43.670 --> 26:46.005
anyone who gave her
information!

26:46.038 --> 26:48.908
They met while they were
working together.

26:50.677 --> 26:51.878
Yeah?

26:51.911 --> 26:53.112
They fell in love.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.080
What?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.152
Joe and Saida were married.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.287
They were married?

27:04.056 --> 27:05.658
No one was
supposed to know.

27:06.793 --> 27:07.860
He wasn't a Muslim,

27:07.894 --> 27:09.028
our family would
never approve.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.029
Saida knew that.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.831
So, what, some sort of...

27:11.864 --> 27:14.000
Honor killing?
I don't know.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.102
So your family...

27:16.135 --> 27:18.738
Saida and I were progressive,
our families are not.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.272
They would kill
their own daughter?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.274
It is deeply ingrained
in our culture.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.176
Her father, her mother,
her brothers--

27:24.210 --> 27:26.378
all of them would be shunned
because of her actions.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.881
I tracked the family,
and they weren't in the States.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.349
There are surrogates.

27:30.382 --> 27:33.352
Our families have
many friends.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.724
MEGAN: Married to
a non-Muslim.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.058
Put her life
in danger.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.393
Well, it's perceived as
a disgrace to the family.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.029
I mean, it changes
everything.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.064
Where are we on
locating Karnes?

27:45.097 --> 27:47.133
I talked with the people
at the motel in Hermosa,

27:47.166 --> 27:48.467
they recognized the photo,
but they said

27:48.500 --> 27:49.769
he left
two days ago,

27:49.802 --> 27:50.803
so we're sweeping
the room for DNA

27:50.837 --> 27:52.071
and fingerprints.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.773
We're pretty sure
he was on the phone with her

27:53.806 --> 27:55.074
when she was
killed.

27:55.107 --> 27:58.778
He heard his wife being killed.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.479
Which means he's
not our assailant.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.181
And yet now he's gone.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.283
Someone's trying
to set him up, you know?

28:04.316 --> 28:06.018
Which means they obviously
knew about the relationship.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.286
So our murderer
can still be linked

28:07.319 --> 28:08.487
to the fatwa or the legal cases.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.156
Yeah, I mean people
that worked with them

28:10.189 --> 28:11.190
would know they're a couple.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.159
It's hard to keep
that secret.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.761
Who's motivated to frame him?

28:14.794 --> 28:17.229
Her family, to restore honor.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.931
Or somebody
she was prosecuting.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.166
Both of which could
have accomplices

28:20.199 --> 28:22.201
-in Southern California.
-So we're back to

28:22.234 --> 28:23.836
hundreds of suspects again.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.337
Well, no.

28:25.371 --> 28:29.241
Because I took the 112 names
we came up with yesterday,

28:29.275 --> 28:31.978
and applied
social image typology

28:32.011 --> 28:33.345
to generate
a more targeted list.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.914
(computer chirping)

28:34.947 --> 28:37.984
A list of possible murderers.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.786
Now we pose
the question:

28:39.819 --> 28:41.954
"Who's most likely
to commit fraud?"

28:41.988 --> 28:44.123
Fundamentalists believe
that God is behind them;

28:44.156 --> 28:46.258
they're not going to shift
blame, so we can eliminate them.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.127
This ain't no
religious killing.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.528
Can you be sure about that?

28:49.561 --> 28:51.330
The most likely group
are career criminals.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.865
See, because she was killed here

28:52.899 --> 28:54.133
and not in Iraq,

28:54.166 --> 28:56.168
this is an opportunity
for someone who lives here.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.871
She was prosecuting war
criminals hiding outside Iraq.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.273
And, you know, that's been
bothering me all along.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.875
That, you know, why would...

29:02.909 --> 29:04.410
why would anyone
go through all the trouble

29:04.443 --> 29:06.245
to set up
an international murder

29:06.278 --> 29:07.847
when you don't have to?

29:07.880 --> 29:08.981
Some of these
names are

29:09.015 --> 29:12.084
in her legal cases-- the
ex-Baathists, Saddam's men.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.153
Professional criminals
with something personal

29:14.186 --> 29:15.888
to gain
from her death.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.256
There's 18 names on this list,

29:17.289 --> 29:18.390
that's still a lot.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.792
So we're going
to leave Karnes

29:19.826 --> 29:20.759
to the army.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.162
KARNES:
Saida?

29:23.195 --> 29:24.563
(thunder cracks)

29:24.596 --> 29:25.564
Wait.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.567
We know that Karnes is innocent.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.169
And he's been gone
since the murder.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.171
I'm going to posit
that he's probably

29:32.204 --> 29:33.906
out to avenge
the murder of his wife.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.175
And if I'm Karnes and
I'm trying to track the killer

29:36.208 --> 29:38.144
but avoid the army,
I'm going to need cover,

29:38.177 --> 29:39.411
a place
to work out of...

29:39.445 --> 29:41.047
A sympathetic ally.

29:42.048 --> 29:42.982
(knocking)

29:47.219 --> 29:48.554
Daniel Ratchet?

29:48.587 --> 29:49.621
Who's asking?

29:49.655 --> 29:52.191
I'm Special Agent Granger,
this is Agent Johnson,

29:52.224 --> 29:54.060
we're from the FBI.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.995
You and Joe Karnes, you enlisted
together and served in Iraq,

29:56.028 --> 29:58.030
-am I right?
-Yeah. So?

29:58.064 --> 29:59.565
Have you heard from him
in the last few days?

29:59.598 --> 30:01.868
No.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.937
Okay, look, man, I just want
to talk to the guy.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.205
I don't care that he's AWOL.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.406
What do you want, man?

30:07.439 --> 30:08.507
I haven't
seen him.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.479
All right, look,
I served in Afghanistan,

30:13.512 --> 30:15.514
CID, the same
as Joe.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.216
I just want to help him.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.350
Sure you do.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.319
We know that Joe is innocent.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.587
We're trying
to find

30:21.620 --> 30:22.588
Saida's killer.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.190
We want the same thing Joe does,

30:24.223 --> 30:25.591
but I need to talk to him

30:25.624 --> 30:28.360
before he does
something crazy.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.963
If Joe kills somebody,
I can't help him.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.631
Now, that bag,
is that really yours?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.533
All the way
up there?

30:34.566 --> 30:35.968
How do you know
he's innocent?

30:36.002 --> 30:37.003
You mind if I come in?

30:38.070 --> 30:39.238
(glass shattering)

30:39.271 --> 30:40.973
-Hey, go around the back!
-What the hell are you doing?

30:41.007 --> 30:42.441
RATCHET:
Joe, run!

30:46.245 --> 30:48.614
I just want
to talk to you, man!

30:59.291 --> 31:01.260
Get out of the way,
out of the way, FBI!

31:07.266 --> 31:09.401
Look, I just want
to talk to you, okay?

31:09.435 --> 31:11.403
Who are you, man?

31:11.437 --> 31:13.572
(both men grunting
and groaning)

31:26.352 --> 31:27.920
Just calm down, man.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.488
I just want to talk.

31:32.558 --> 31:36.362
They killed my wife.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.663
MEGAN:
Who did?

31:37.696 --> 31:40.299
Her family?

31:40.332 --> 31:42.234
Was it them?

31:42.268 --> 31:44.303
An honor killing because
she married a non-Muslim?

31:44.336 --> 31:46.238
An honor killing, maybe.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.606
Not because of me.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.409
They never knew we were married.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.144
So what do you mean then?

31:52.178 --> 31:55.647
Saddam's son had his men
go to schools

31:55.681 --> 31:57.449
to pick up girls for sex.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.220
They raped
hundreds of girls.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.355
Everybody knew about it,

32:03.389 --> 32:07.059
they were just too terrified
to speak up.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.060
Except Saida.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.429
She was one of the girls.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.999
She was going to testify...

32:13.032 --> 32:14.200
against the man who raped her.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.035
For the War Tribunal.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.536
That's why we came here,

32:17.569 --> 32:20.139
so she could give
a deposition.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.174
He slit her throat
because of it.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.310
Just tell us who he is.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.677
She was my wife, I will

32:25.711 --> 32:26.478
handle this!

32:26.512 --> 32:28.480
We're not going
to let you just

32:28.514 --> 32:30.449
go out and
murder someone.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.598
I have to do this.
You know I do.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.367
You are making
stupid decisions

32:48.400 --> 32:50.702
right now because
you're emotional.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.738
Look, I'm just gonna lay out

32:52.771 --> 32:54.373
your best
option for you.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.675
You work with our team,
we find this ass

32:56.708 --> 32:58.177
and put him in jail,

32:58.210 --> 32:59.578
and we'll do
everything we can

32:59.611 --> 33:01.647
to help straighten out things
between you and the Army

33:01.680 --> 33:03.182
and get you back to your life.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.583
I don't have a life.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.752
Think about this
for a minute.

33:06.785 --> 33:09.788
You are AWOL, which means
you are going to jail,

33:09.821 --> 33:11.390
and while you're
sitting there, the guy

33:11.423 --> 33:13.359
who did this to Saida--
he's gonna be getting away.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.227
Ask yourself

33:15.261 --> 33:17.629
what she would want you to do.

33:19.698 --> 33:24.103
Um, can you square it
with the Army so that I...

33:24.136 --> 33:26.138
I can go to her funeral?

33:26.172 --> 33:28.540
Yeah, I'll try.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.542
(sighs)

33:30.576 --> 33:33.279
But I need to know
who was she testifying against.

33:33.312 --> 33:37.549
A Republican Guard named
Qari Qassim

33:37.583 --> 33:40.286
who worked
for Saddam's son.

33:40.319 --> 33:43.489
He raped her when she was 15.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.591
Qari is in Iraq,

33:45.624 --> 33:48.194
but his cousin,
Sami Qassim, he is here.

33:48.227 --> 33:49.795
It was Sami who did this.

33:49.828 --> 33:53.499
Sami Qassim,
who was on Charlie's list.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.501
Baathist war criminal,

33:55.534 --> 33:58.104
Republican Guard,
missing since 2003.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.139
We haven't been able
to locate him.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.707
Well, we have hair
and DNA samples

34:01.740 --> 34:02.541
from the crime scene.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.776
If we can find him,
we can match it.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.178
Yeah, but this
guy was able

34:06.212 --> 34:07.279
to hide himself in
his own community.

34:07.313 --> 34:09.415
Well, there's a pretty
good chance no one really knows

34:09.448 --> 34:10.682
-who he is.
-MEGAN: Or they do,

34:10.716 --> 34:11.550
and they support him anyway.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.551
You think it's worth

34:12.584 --> 34:14.453
reaching out to the Imam again?

34:14.486 --> 34:16.255
There's no way
he's gonna turn in Qassim.

34:16.288 --> 34:19.191
Unless we can prove
Qassim isn't a sincere Muslim.

34:19.225 --> 34:20.692
But how are we gonna do that?

34:20.726 --> 34:23.429
Nasreen said she and her cousin
were like sisters

34:23.462 --> 34:25.131
when they were kids.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.332
My guess is, if she were raped,

34:26.365 --> 34:27.599
I mean,
Nasreen would know, right?

34:27.633 --> 34:30.802
And she could tell Saida's story
to the Imam?

34:30.836 --> 34:33.105
What happened to Saida
disgraced her family.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.107
No one cares
about what happened to her.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.109
The Imam may even
hold her responsible.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.510
Yeah? How do
you know that?

34:38.544 --> 34:40.446
I grew up
in this culture.

34:40.479 --> 34:42.548
The Imam will never
deliver this man to you,

34:42.581 --> 34:44.750
not on the word
of a woman.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.618
But I think I can.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.755
I think I can make
him come out of hiding.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.558
What do you mean?

34:52.591 --> 34:54.560
What if we had a memorial
service for Saida,

34:54.593 --> 34:57.529
and let it be known that I'm
going to name Qassim in public?

34:57.563 --> 34:58.764
You know,
shame him.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.766
No, I don't know about that.

35:00.799 --> 35:01.867
He is evil.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.570
I am tired of
being afraid.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.773
My entire life, I have been
afraid of men like him.

35:07.806 --> 35:11.777
Look, how do you know you can
even get the word out to him?

35:11.810 --> 35:13.145
The Imam.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.181
They will send an E-mail
to the community

35:15.214 --> 35:16.915
letting them know about
the service, and saying

35:16.948 --> 35:19.618
that I'm going to
speak out, name names.

35:19.651 --> 35:24.890
The Imam will want Qassim to
know that I am accusing him.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.266
CHARLIE:
So what time's your flight?

35:34.300 --> 35:35.667
-SUSAN: 4:00.
-4:00?

35:35.701 --> 35:38.804
Yeah, and I should run.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.607
But I wanted to see you
before I left.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.442
You know, I have a
standing invitation

35:43.475 --> 35:45.477
to lecture
at Cambridge.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.347
And I'm thinking of taking them
up on that offer.

35:48.380 --> 35:52.418
Then we can really see each
other as often as we like.

35:52.451 --> 35:55.887
Oh! Charlie...

35:57.656 --> 35:59.425
Oh, you know I adore you.

35:59.458 --> 36:02.228
I just...

36:02.261 --> 36:04.196
This has been lovely.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.200
I see.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.438
Okay.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.773
Wow.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.609
Oh, I know. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.247
You're not
married, are you?

36:21.280 --> 36:22.614
No.

36:22.648 --> 36:23.849
And you're
not engaged?

36:23.882 --> 36:25.351
No, not really.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.518
Not really?

36:26.552 --> 36:27.786
Yeah.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.588
Well, I, uh...

36:29.621 --> 36:32.924
Started seeing each other
a few months ago, and...

36:32.958 --> 36:34.960
He has children,

36:34.993 --> 36:39.298
whom I like, amazingly.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.667
I probably shouldn't have...
with you.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.403
It just...
You know, it felt right.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.904
I have no regrets.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.239
-No.
-None.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.474
No, nor do I.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.611
I just hope
I didn't mislead you.

36:52.644 --> 36:53.945
You know? I-I...

36:53.979 --> 36:55.414
I do adore you. I...

37:01.553 --> 37:04.723
Let's get you
to the airport.

37:06.592 --> 37:07.959
Sami Qassim.

37:07.993 --> 37:10.562
He was a leader in the
Republican Guard under Saddam.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.963
This guy is brutal.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.400
And he's got nothing to lose,
so we want to stop him

37:14.433 --> 37:15.834
before he even makes it
into the mosque.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.035
Now remember, our first

37:17.068 --> 37:19.638
priority is to protect
Nasreen Kafaji.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.707
No matter what goes down,
you stay with her.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.709
Qassim could have accomplices
we don't know about.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.043
All right, let's do this.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.478
All right, guys,
let's go.

37:26.512 --> 37:28.647
Let's hurry it up.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.249
(Islamic Call to Prayer
over loudspeaker)

37:33.885 --> 37:37.623
(Call to Prayer continues)

37:41.560 --> 37:43.329
We're about two minutes
out. How you doing?

37:43.362 --> 37:44.996
There's no sign of him yet, Don.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.433
We got guys
in the surrounding buildings,

37:47.466 --> 37:48.734
on the ground, and two agents

37:48.767 --> 37:50.302
by the entrance to the mosque

37:50.336 --> 37:51.703
to escort her in
when she arrives.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.672
DON:
Right.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.674
And we swept the mosque
for bombs. It's clean inside.

37:55.707 --> 37:58.310
Copy that.
See you in a minute. Heads up.

37:59.645 --> 38:00.946
So, when we pull up,
two of my guys

38:00.979 --> 38:03.014
are going to
escort you inside.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.450
Just let them
guide you, okay?

38:04.483 --> 38:05.617
Don't go off
into the crowd,

38:05.651 --> 38:06.952
even if you see
someone you know.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.754
Okay. I'm scared.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.722
Oh, you'll be fine.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.325
We've got agents
all over the place.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.427
You with me?

38:18.029 --> 38:22.334
(crowd chatter)

38:28.607 --> 38:30.041
All right, here we go.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.377
Here we go.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.878
Copy that.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.556
Everyone in position.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.525
We're good to go.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.034
(man laughing)

38:58.870 --> 39:01.640
(women laughing)

39:01.673 --> 39:03.542
(indistinct chatter)

39:13.051 --> 39:13.952
Keep those people back.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.687
They're getting too close.
Keep 'em back.

39:16.922 --> 39:19.625
(people speaking
foreign language)

39:22.193 --> 39:25.564
(gunshots, screaming)

39:25.597 --> 39:26.798
Shots fired.
Primary hit.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.934
Lock this place
down. Shut it up.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.502
FBI. Everybody, get down,
get down.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.537
DON:
Eyes on the perimeter.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.604
Get on the ground!

39:32.638 --> 39:33.839
They've gone inside the
mosque. Give me a code four.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.908
(man speaking
foreign language)

39:42.013 --> 39:44.783
Sierra Team leader, do we
have eyes on the shooter?

39:44.816 --> 39:46.184
Eyes on the perimeter.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.052
Does anybody have eyes

39:47.085 --> 39:49.087
-on the shooter?
-Go inside the mosque.

39:50.489 --> 39:51.423
Colby!

39:51.457 --> 39:53.058
On the right side in the grass!
That's him!

39:53.892 --> 39:55.060
Get down!

39:58.163 --> 39:59.465
(grunts)

39:59.498 --> 40:00.599
(panting)

40:05.136 --> 40:06.738
What's his status?

40:06.772 --> 40:08.474
He's dead.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.547
DON:
You okay?

40:15.581 --> 40:17.449
Did we get him?

40:17.483 --> 40:18.817
Yeah, we got him.
Are you all right?

40:18.850 --> 40:20.686
You sure?

40:20.719 --> 40:22.588
She's gonna be sore,
but she's gonna be okay.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.755
I'm so sorry.

40:23.789 --> 40:27.025
No. No apologies.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.027
You saved my life.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.497
Well...

40:31.530 --> 40:33.499
The man who raped Saida--

40:33.532 --> 40:35.634
he's still there.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.969
He's still going on
with his life,

40:38.003 --> 40:40.038
and doing God knows what

40:40.071 --> 40:41.807
to who.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.810
I'm going back to Iraq.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.078
That's pretty brave.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.614
I won't be alone.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.551
Saida will be there with me.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.225
ALAN:
What happened?

41:00.258 --> 41:01.927
-(TV plays in the background)
-Huh? Oh.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.229
-Uh, I don't know. -What do you
mean, you don't know?

41:04.262 --> 41:05.230
You're sitting right here.

41:05.263 --> 41:06.832
Oh, Dad, those look good.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.567
Yeah, well, next
time, you're the cook.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.969
Well, that's not a good idea,
you know that.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.270
What are you moping
around here all night?

41:12.303 --> 41:14.039
-What's going on?
-What do you want from me?

41:14.072 --> 41:16.107
Leave me alone.
I'm watching the game.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.976
All of a sudden,
you're interested in the game?

41:18.009 --> 41:20.245
-Hey, Don, what's happening?
-Hey, Chuck.

41:20.278 --> 41:21.680
Where's Susan?

41:21.713 --> 41:24.249
Oh, she flew back to England.

41:24.282 --> 41:25.684
You know, if I were you,

41:25.717 --> 41:27.218
I'd make up some excuse
to go see her,

41:27.252 --> 41:28.486
because that girl
was worth pursuing.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.657
You know what? I don't want her
to get the wrong idea, you know?

41:31.690 --> 41:34.025
What do you mean?
What's the wrong idea?

41:34.059 --> 41:37.162
I'm really not that
serious about her.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.229
I'm sorry.

41:38.263 --> 41:41.132
What the hell does it take
for you to be interested?

41:41.166 --> 41:43.535
Amita is beautiful,
this girl's a stunner.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.170
-What do you need?
-DON: I think he just wants

41:45.203 --> 41:46.237
to be the cutest in bed.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.739
Shut up.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.274
You got a neuroscientist
with a body like that.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.909
Who's winning?

41:50.942 --> 41:52.978
I don't know.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.245
Apparently, not us.

41:54.279 --> 41:55.847
Well, speak for yourself.

41:55.881 --> 41:57.783
-I've got a date tomorrow night.
-Oh, yeah?

41:57.816 --> 41:59.250
-With who?
-With whom.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.819
All right, with whom?

42:00.852 --> 42:02.253
-I'm not saying.
-The caterer.

42:02.287 --> 42:03.254
I'm not saying.

42:03.288 --> 42:04.389
I don't want to jinx it.

42:04.422 --> 42:06.925
And you guys have the worst luck
with the opposite sex.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.126
I'm not
gonna jinx it.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.228
I resent that.
I don't have bad luck.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.063
You have been on a pretty bad
losing streak.

42:12.097 --> 42:13.799
What do you mean, Charlie?
Look at you.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.634
Me? I got them coming out of
the woodwork.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.869
All I want to know is
when do I get grandchildren?

42:17.903 --> 42:20.005
I mean, you try doing my job
and having a relationship.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.273
-You try.
-Woe is Don.
