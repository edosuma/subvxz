00:25.920 --> 00:27.640
MOBILE INVESTIGATION UNIT CHIEF
DURING THE YOO YOUNG-CHUL CASE

00:27.720 --> 00:29.600
So I thought he went to kill more people.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.360
He'll take another innocent life.

00:34.600 --> 00:40.000
<i>When I heard we lost him,
I just lay down feeling hopeless.</i>

00:41.640 --> 00:43.000
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

00:44.480 --> 00:47.160
"What am I going to do now?"
I was at a loss.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.240
I ran out after him,
and it was pouring down.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.880
He just walked out the front gate.

01:10.600 --> 01:14.080
We lost him because we let our guard down.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.720
I was supposed to take him to the scene,

01:20.800 --> 01:24.280
so I told my team to get our van ready
as I was running out to chase him.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.080
He was left alone in the corridor.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.200
He was alone.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.240
"What? Where did everyone go?"

01:33.680 --> 01:37.440
<i>He walked out without his shoes,
and no one stopped him.</i>

01:38.480 --> 01:40.920
I thought, "We're screwed
if we don't catch him."

01:42.000 --> 01:45.640
Everyone had gone home
except for about 20 detectives on duty.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.080
I assembled all 100 officers.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.800
<i>"We have an emergency."</i>

01:49.880 --> 01:51.200
It was midnight.

01:51.880 --> 01:56.000
We combed through the streets all night.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.600
We were frazzled, running around
and trying to find him.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.720
I searched every alley with my team.

02:03.800 --> 02:08.200
<i>Every single alley in sight. It was crazy.</i>

02:11.000 --> 02:13.360
Then I thought to myself,

02:13.440 --> 02:15.120
"Okay, he managed to escape,

02:16.960 --> 02:18.320
but where could he have gone?

02:19.320 --> 02:24.240
<i>Where in Seoul,
a city where ten million people live?"</i>

02:25.760 --> 02:27.920
There were so many places he could be.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.800
<i>I met up with my mother and sister
at my place and got changed.</i>

02:49.640 --> 02:54.120
<i>Then I put my hammer, knife, scissors,
shovel, and sledgehammer in garbage bags</i>

02:54.200 --> 02:57.440
<i>along with the bag
that was captured on CCTV in Hyehwa-dong</i>

02:58.240 --> 03:01.520
<i>and threw them in the dumpsters
in the area.</i>

03:12.600 --> 03:18.320
<i>I had been working as a prosecutor
for about ten years at the time.</i>

03:20.280 --> 03:25.120
<i>A police detective
came to see me at around 11:00 p.m.</i>

03:25.200 --> 03:26.440
FORMER PROSECUTOR
IN CHARGE OF THE YOO YOUNG-CHUL CASE

03:26.520 --> 03:31.240
Although the suspect had escaped,

03:31.320 --> 03:35.560
the detective came to me
asking for official release documents.

03:35.640 --> 03:41.000
He said they wanted to release him
because it was a minor case

03:41.080 --> 03:42.920
and asked me to sign the paper.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.640
<i>How embarrassing is it</i>

03:47.720 --> 03:50.600
<i>for a special investigations unit
at the Police Headquarters</i>

03:50.680 --> 03:53.280
to let such a heinous criminal escape?

03:54.760 --> 04:00.600
Hence, we wanted to just call it
a theft case for the time being

04:00.680 --> 04:03.440
because he did steal a cell phone.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.120
When I refused to sign it,

04:06.200 --> 04:09.560
he told me what had really happened

04:10.760 --> 04:12.640
and asked me for help.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.080
There's a world of difference
between an honest mistake

04:20.600 --> 04:25.640
made by someone trying to do their best

04:25.720 --> 04:28.520
and dishonest cops
trying to cover up their corrupt deeds…

04:33.160 --> 04:37.080
so I signed the release form…

04:40.280 --> 04:44.400
fully knowing
that both the detective and I

04:44.480 --> 04:48.680
would be punished for falsification
of documents if they failed to catch him.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.440
I was extremely anxious.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.840
At the time, I usually smoked
a pack of cigarettes a day on average.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.720
But that night, I went through
an entire carton of cigarettes.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.040
<i>I was anxious.</i>

05:18.120 --> 05:21.040
All my colleagues told me
that I looked pale.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.360
<i>The chances of arresting him again
were very slim.</i>

05:26.120 --> 05:29.080
<i>After a nightlong stakeout in the rain,</i>

05:30.320 --> 05:34.640
<i>all the detectives caught a cold
and weren't feeling well.</i>

05:35.400 --> 05:38.160
<i>They asked me if they could stand down
for the time being.</i>

05:39.040 --> 05:40.120
And I said, "Hey.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.520
If we do that, we lose him for good.
We have to catch him now.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.400
It's now or never."

05:55.880 --> 06:01.080
KIM SANG-JOONG, DETECTIVE
THE MOBILE INVESTIGATION UNIT (RET.)

06:01.960 --> 06:06.600
I had been a detective for decades.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.160
At the time,

06:08.240 --> 06:12.400
I was already known
as a seasoned detective.

06:16.680 --> 06:22.400
<i>I told my team that we should check
the red light district in Yeongdeungpo.</i>

06:28.160 --> 06:30.560
<i>Knowing that sex workers</i>

06:30.640 --> 06:36.960
were Yoo Young-chul's
main targets at the time,

06:37.040 --> 06:38.880
I trusted my gut and went there.

06:39.400 --> 06:45.120
At the time, I had a number of informants
in the red light district.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.480
<i>A bunch of cops showed up out of the blue.</i>

06:48.560 --> 06:52.120
They blocked the street with their cars,
obstructing my business.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.400
They didn't just stay in the cars though.
I saw them running around.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.400
<i>Then suddenly, like a scene from a movie,</i>

07:04.120 --> 07:08.680
we spotted Yoo Young-chul
crossing the street.

07:11.200 --> 07:14.680
He was rubbing an egg over his eye
to get the swelling down.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.200
He was about to cross the street

07:17.280 --> 07:20.840
<i>when he was spotted by the detectives
on the other side of the crosswalk.</i>

07:20.920 --> 07:22.400
They shouted, "There he is!"

07:23.560 --> 07:27.840
<i>All the police cars started chasing him.
It looked like a gang fight.</i>

07:28.600 --> 07:31.560
Yoo Young-chul went on a total rampage.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.840
He fiercely resisted,

07:34.400 --> 07:36.360
so we struggled to take him down.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.240
We had to use force to cuff him.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.800
<i>Yoo Young-chul was all worked up.
And the first thing he said was,</i>

07:42.880 --> 07:49.080
"You'll be shocked
if you find out who I am."

07:49.560 --> 07:53.360
He said he was a heinous criminal

07:53.440 --> 07:57.440
and that we were no match for him.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.320
<i>So we managed to arrest him again</i>

08:02.120 --> 08:04.520
<i>even though it was like
finding a needle in a haystack</i>

08:04.600 --> 08:06.480
in a big city like Seoul.

08:07.040 --> 08:13.160
This may sound like a boast,
but the detectives were very insightful.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.080
We lucked out.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.920
That's why we went to Yeongdeungpo.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.480
It was largely due to luck.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.200
But as they say, luck is what happens

08:27.280 --> 08:28.600
when preparation meets opportunity.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.400
Chief Kang Dae-won was very excited
that we caught him.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.760
He gave me a big hug
and even kissed me on the cheek.

08:34.840 --> 08:38.600
He said, "Well done."

08:41.320 --> 08:45.520
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

08:46.159 --> 08:49.760
<i>When I was back in the interrogation room
after being arrested again,</i>

08:50.680 --> 08:52.240
<i>one of the cops there said to me,</i>

08:52.720 --> 08:54.160
<i>"Thanks, you son of a bitch."</i>

08:55.600 --> 08:56.800
So I retorted,

08:56.880 --> 08:58.280
"Morons."

09:04.520 --> 09:07.720
MOBILE INVESTIGATION UNIT DETECTIVE
DURING THE YOO YOUNG-CHUL CASE

09:07.800 --> 09:11.520
The thing is, we had no proof
the first time we caught him.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
But before he escaped, he had mentioned

09:16.080 --> 09:19.000
the incident with the old couple
and the cases with the girls.

09:19.080 --> 09:23.280
So we had to interrogate him
about those cases again.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.640
<i>He said, "Thank goodness you caught me.</i>

09:27.440 --> 09:29.400
<i>If I wasn't caught,</i>

09:29.480 --> 09:33.360
<i>I'd go on killing
at least a hundred more people."</i>

09:34.360 --> 09:39.640
We wanted to investigate it
as quickly as possible

09:39.720 --> 09:42.680
so we could get him to confess.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.400
<i>It was around 11:00 p.m.</i>

09:50.480 --> 09:53.000
<i>That night, it was raining hard in Seoul.</i>

09:56.720 --> 09:58.960
<i>The Head of Investigations called me,</i>

09:59.040 --> 10:01.160
<i>so I rushed
to the Regional Investigation Unit.</i>

10:02.600 --> 10:05.320
We had to confirm
if his statements were accurate

10:05.400 --> 10:07.280
and whether or not
he was telling us the truth.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.400
I thought to myself, "This man is scary."

10:13.040 --> 10:15.160
He didn't know who I was,

10:15.640 --> 10:17.760
so he tried to pick a fight with me.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.760
He said, "Who are you?

10:22.240 --> 10:23.640
What's a woman doing here?

10:24.320 --> 10:26.160
Do you know me? Did you see me?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.800
Did you see me at the scene?"
He kept going on like that.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.400
"What's she doing here?"
Then he refused to talk.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.840
He just wouldn't talk,

10:34.520 --> 10:36.760
so I couldn't stay there.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.280
He resented women, you know.

10:39.360 --> 10:42.280
So I left the room

10:42.360 --> 10:44.080
and listened in from outside,

10:44.160 --> 10:45.880
from a place where he couldn't see me.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.120
<i>He said, "I'll confess everything."</i>

10:52.160 --> 10:57.240
<i>He drew maps of the four murder scenes,</i>

10:58.360 --> 11:01.000
<i>including objects and their locations
which he wouldn't have known</i>

11:01.080 --> 11:03.080
<i>had he never been to the scenes.</i>

11:05.800 --> 11:08.880
<i>He drew the things that were
at the scenes. He remembered everything…</i>

11:10.400 --> 11:11.560
<i>to a tee.</i>

11:12.080 --> 11:14.360
<i>He seemed to know the layouts very well</i>

11:14.440 --> 11:16.160
<i>in such detail.</i>

11:16.240 --> 11:17.880
<i>That's why I became certain</i>

11:17.960 --> 11:19.160
<i>that he was the guy.</i>

11:20.440 --> 11:21.560
He was the killer.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.640
There was no doubt about it.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.360
He told us everything in such detail.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.360
He gave us a detailed explanation
as if he was a teacher

11:30.440 --> 11:31.960
talking to his students.

11:32.040 --> 11:38.840
That was him
wanting to brag about his crimes.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.320
It's a common tendency
among all serial killers.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.640
They think they're superior
and want to boast about it.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.760
<i>Instead of starting his sentence
with what he did,</i>

11:52.840 --> 11:54.840
<i>he'd throw things out there like,</i>

11:54.920 --> 11:59.000
<i>"If I say this,
the world will be turned upside down."</i>

12:00.320 --> 12:03.400
He said he killed dozens of women,

12:03.480 --> 12:09.520
cut them up in 17 to 18 pieces,

12:09.600 --> 12:10.880
<i>and buried them in secret.</i>

12:14.520 --> 12:16.080
<i>At first, I doubted him</i>

12:16.160 --> 12:19.480
because what he was describing
was beyond my imagination.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.320
<i>He believed that he needed to punish them</i>

12:25.600 --> 12:28.000
<i>in the name of God,</i>

12:28.560 --> 12:32.760
as if he had the right to punish others.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.960
He was delusional.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.560
<i>He was familiar
with the area around Bongwon Temple.</i>

12:42.640 --> 12:44.600
<i>There was a forest behind the temple,</i>

12:44.680 --> 12:49.240
so he thought it'd be a good burial spot.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.160
<i>I couldn't stop killing.</i>

13:05.640 --> 13:09.280
<i>It was only after I buried the carcasses
that I could get a good night's sleep</i>

13:09.760 --> 13:14.400
<i>because it gave me a sense of relief
that I had won against my demons.</i>

13:16.320 --> 13:19.560
It was just about to get dark,
but he said he'd show us the crime scene.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.000
<i>There was a bamboo grove.</i>

13:26.600 --> 13:28.920
And there was a bottle cap on the ground.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.360
<i>He said he had marked the burial site
with the bottle cap</i>

13:36.440 --> 13:38.560
<i>and that we'd find a body underneath.</i>

13:41.960 --> 13:44.440
He pinpointed the location,

13:44.520 --> 13:48.160
and as soon as I started digging,

13:48.640 --> 13:53.400
<i>a torrential downpour began</i>

13:53.480 --> 13:55.040
<i>and continued for about an hour.</i>

13:59.720 --> 14:01.440
So we said to Yoo Young-chul,

14:01.520 --> 14:04.040
"Look, this is your fault.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.640
The fury and cries of the women you killed

14:06.720 --> 14:09.680
<i>are sending down this rain upon you."</i>

14:11.160 --> 14:13.880
Then I shoveled again,

14:13.960 --> 14:16.640
and right then and there

14:17.200 --> 14:19.680
I found a bone

14:19.760 --> 14:21.560
about as long as my arm.

14:29.880 --> 14:35.120
That was when I knew
he was indeed telling us the truth.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.600
<i>I've been a reporter since 2000,</i>

15:04.680 --> 15:07.040
<i>so it's been exactly 20 years.</i>

15:09.800 --> 15:14.160
<i>I'm usually relaxed
when I work on Sundays,</i>

15:14.240 --> 15:18.040
but that day was especially…

15:18.120 --> 15:22.440
It was a shockingly horrific Sunday,

15:22.520 --> 15:24.960
full of suspense.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.880
<i>The police have arrested a serial killer
who has killed 19 people to date.</i>

15:29.960 --> 15:33.160
<i>His victims include wealthy seniors
and women in their 20s.</i>

15:34.120 --> 15:35.760
<i>The 34-year-old killer, Yoo Young-chul,</i>

15:35.840 --> 15:37.640
<i>lured women working
in massage parlors to his home,</i>

15:37.720 --> 15:39.720
<i>killed them with a blunt weapon,
mutilated their bodies,</i>

15:39.800 --> 15:43.440
<i>and buried them in the mountains in Seoul.</i>

15:44.560 --> 15:48.040
The next morning,
we went back there with Forensics

15:48.120 --> 15:49.600
and inspected the scene.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.520
<i>We were quite nervous.
We went there fully prepared</i>

15:53.600 --> 15:56.040
because it was

15:56.120 --> 15:59.200
a huge case.

15:59.280 --> 16:03.440
<i>And we had to excavate the bodies
buried in the ground.</i>

16:03.920 --> 16:07.320
There were reporters
from all over the world.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.400
<i>Some of them brought cranes,
the ones you see at construction sites.</i>

16:10.480 --> 16:12.280
<i>They were filming from up there.</i>

16:12.360 --> 16:14.160
We had to cover his face.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.600
I had this mask and hat on my desk,

16:17.680 --> 16:18.920
so I put them on him

16:19.000 --> 16:21.560
<i>and made him wear this raincoat.</i>

16:22.440 --> 16:25.440
I had never dealt with or even heard

16:25.520 --> 16:27.880
of a serial murder case

16:27.960 --> 16:30.360
that involved

16:30.440 --> 16:32.040
so many victims.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.120
It was utterly shocking and horrifying.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.520
Gosh, it's…

16:37.200 --> 16:39.800
It still sends chills down my spine.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.880
It was an extremely shocking case.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.080
<i>They discovered the bodies
shortly after they started digging.</i>

17:00.160 --> 17:02.400
<i>Once they discovered the bodies,
they had to use their hands</i>

17:02.480 --> 17:03.760
<i>instead of the shovels.</i>

17:03.840 --> 17:05.760
<i>Using their hands,</i>

17:05.840 --> 17:08.920
they carefully unearthed
the dismembered body parts.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.960
It was absolutely gruesome.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.359
<i>We numbered them.</i>

17:14.920 --> 17:19.040
Head number one, chest number two,
and so on.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.119
We numbered all the body parts,

17:21.200 --> 17:22.800
and there were 18 in total.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.200
Their heads were found

17:26.280 --> 17:30.079
beside their neatly placed
arms and joints.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.960
He said, "This belongs to this person.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.000
<i>And this bit belongs to so-and-so."</i>

17:35.840 --> 17:38.320
The act of dismembering the victims

17:39.040 --> 17:40.280
tells us that

17:41.360 --> 17:43.680
he had no sympathy
for his victims whatsoever.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.760
Only the devil would do such a thing.

17:46.840 --> 17:47.680
He was pure evil.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.960
It was so horrific
that it made me shudder.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.000
I thought about how…

18:00.760 --> 18:05.320
I was sad thinking how the victims
have died unfair and tragic deaths.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.760
Seeing the sheer brutality
right before my eyes

18:08.760 --> 18:10.240
sent shivers down my spine.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.040
<i>He was always calm, no matter what he saw.</i>

18:14.120 --> 18:17.040
But he was constantly
retracing his steps in his mind,

18:17.560 --> 18:19.280
thinking about what he did,

18:19.360 --> 18:23.960
who the victims were
and how he killed them.

18:24.040 --> 18:27.320
He remembered exactly what he did
to each victim and how he killed them.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.960
And he talked about it
with such confidence.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.560
"No, that's not how I killed her.
I killed her like this."

18:34.640 --> 18:36.120
This is how he talked.

18:37.160 --> 18:40.640
<i>I remember the moment
when Yoo Young-chul glanced at me.</i>

18:40.720 --> 18:44.360
When I saw his eyes…

18:44.960 --> 18:48.240
I may have been biased,

18:48.760 --> 18:50.960
but I sensed something deeply disturbing.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.680
<i>Fifteen years have passed,
and many have forgotten about the case,</i>

19:17.760 --> 19:19.600
<i>but being back here</i>

19:19.680 --> 19:21.320
<i>is bringing back all the memories.</i>

19:23.800 --> 19:26.520
This place still looks exactly the same.
Nothing's changed.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.320
If you look at the photos from that time,
you'll see me

19:29.400 --> 19:32.120
standing next to Yoo Young-chul making him
watch the excavation right here.

19:34.920 --> 19:35.920
<i>It was right here.</i>

19:37.080 --> 19:38.520
The bodies were found in a row…

19:40.160 --> 19:42.320
about 30cm apart.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
He had buried them in a row.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.360
We found the bodies

19:49.440 --> 19:54.920
about a month after they were buried here,

19:55.000 --> 19:59.720
so the flesh and bones were still intact.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.960
When we dug them up…

20:03.680 --> 20:04.760
My gosh.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.000
We could barely breathe
because of the awful stench.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.520
<i>Many people wouldn't be able
to understand this,</i>

20:13.200 --> 20:17.320
<i>but when you're exposed to that smell
long enough,</i>

20:17.400 --> 20:18.720
it seeps into your clothes

20:19.800 --> 20:24.640
and into your mind. When that happens,
you just can't get it out of your mind.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.600
Because we're police detectives,
people often think

20:30.680 --> 20:31.880
that such things wouldn't faze us.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.080
But seeing dead bodies
or catching such heinous criminals

20:35.800 --> 20:38.400
can be a very traumatizing experience
for us as well.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.800
<i>I was recording it
with a video camera at the time.</i>

20:42.880 --> 20:44.720
I had to hold the camera still,

20:48.040 --> 20:51.360
but my shoulders were shaking
because I was crying.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.800
If you watch the footage I filmed,
you'll see that the whole thing is shaky.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.440
I felt so…

21:01.320 --> 21:02.520
I can't even describe it.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.440
When I think about that day,
my heart still breaks.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.280
Well…

21:27.360 --> 21:31.400
I still think about all the cases
that I worked on,

21:32.400 --> 21:34.760
but the Yoo Young-chul case
was the most painful one.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.720
It was an unprecedented case.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.720
And he proudly declared

21:48.800 --> 21:51.440
on public television

21:51.520 --> 21:53.200
that he was the culprit

21:53.280 --> 21:58.480
behind this unprecedented
serial murder case.

21:58.560 --> 22:03.080
I hope this teaches women a lesson

22:03.160 --> 22:04.640
that they shouldn't be sluts.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.000
I also hope this teaches the rich
a lesson as well.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.440
I think that fascinated people…

22:17.680 --> 22:18.680
in a way.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.280
It was shocking,
but it also piqued their curiosity.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.440
<i>Serial killers tend
to exaggerate their murders,</i>

22:27.520 --> 22:31.920
<i>and they rationalize their reasons
for having committed such crimes.</i>

22:32.400 --> 22:34.560
Some even believe they are almighty.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.200
<i>He even knew
where he'd be placed on the list</i>

22:39.280 --> 22:41.520
<i>of the world's
most prolific serial killers,</i>

22:41.600 --> 22:45.160
and he wanted to be number one.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.880
He felt no sympathy.

22:48.960 --> 22:52.640
No pity
or sense of responsibility whatsoever.

22:52.720 --> 22:56.480
He thought he was in this game
with God as his partner.

22:56.560 --> 23:01.400
<i>Now, I see that he thought of himself
as this almighty being</i>

23:01.480 --> 23:03.320
<i>like God.</i>

23:05.160 --> 23:06.720
<i>"Yoo Young-chul.</i>

23:06.800 --> 23:09.760
<i>You have transcended human limitations."</i>

23:12.120 --> 23:14.240
<i>What am I, Superman?</i>

23:18.160 --> 23:21.440
Personally, I don't think
he has a god complex.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.640
He got a kick out of the act of killing,

23:24.440 --> 23:25.720
in and of itself.

23:27.800 --> 23:28.880
He enjoyed it.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.840
It was cathartic for him, and he wanted
to amplify the sensations it gave him.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.960
<i>I had worked on many homicide cases,</i>

23:55.040 --> 23:59.120
<i>but this was the first of its kind,
so it really weighed on me.</i>

23:59.720 --> 24:01.880
When I look through

24:03.440 --> 24:08.920
the case files on the 11 women's deaths,

24:09.720 --> 24:12.080
I can still smell it.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.520
Detectives often take the case files

24:15.600 --> 24:17.280
into the autopsy room.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.560
So you still get a whiff of the stench
from the autopsy room.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.280
That nauseating smell.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.960
I know this sounds superstitious, but that
combined with the thunder and lightning

24:29.040 --> 24:31.640
made me wonder
if the souls of the murdered women

24:32.920 --> 24:37.560
were still lingering around to haunt me.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.280
They were murdered by Yoo Young-chul

24:41.360 --> 24:43.960
with no rhyme or reason,

24:44.440 --> 24:47.120
so my heart still breaks
when I think about the victims.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.560
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

24:57.640 --> 25:03.280
We usually use fingerprints
to identify the victims.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.720
But in this case,
there were no fingerprints,

25:05.800 --> 25:07.720
so we couldn't identify the victims.

25:08.280 --> 25:12.280
We were told that the only way
we could identify the victims

25:12.760 --> 25:13.960
was through DNA analysis

25:14.040 --> 25:16.480
and that it'd take

25:16.960 --> 25:19.040
fifteen days at the least.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.280
Not being able to identify
the victims for 15 days

25:23.280 --> 25:24.560
is way too long.

25:26.360 --> 25:30.000
I took a close look at the damaged prints
on the severed hands.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.320
And I thought I should give it a try.

25:36.280 --> 25:40.080
When I told my colleagues I wanted to try
lifting some prints, they all said,

25:40.160 --> 25:43.600
"Detective Kim.
You saw the state they're in.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.520
The fingers have decomposed.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.920
Don't waste your time."

25:52.400 --> 25:54.000
But I insisted on giving it a shot.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.200
I wanted to try everything I could.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.160
So I crouched down
to see if I could lift any fingerprints.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.640
But the rotting fluid was dripping down
from the decomposed finger.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.920
I'd wipe the finger and try again,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.440
but the fluid would drip again
and mess it all up.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.160
From just one finger.

26:14.520 --> 26:15.520
Just one.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.960
I've tried so many times to lift
the fingerprints from that one finger.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.040
I found out that I tried 161 times.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.160
It was 161 times.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.920
I held onto the wrist and prayed.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.280
"Please help me.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.360
I need your help.

26:29.440 --> 26:33.960
Help me so I can send you back
to the warm embrace of your family."

26:34.040 --> 26:36.160
At the time, I didn't realize
I was saying all those things

26:36.240 --> 26:37.760
holding the victim's wrist.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.880
I only heard later from my colleague
who was next to me

26:41.960 --> 26:44.520
that I kept talking to the victim nonstop
as if I was possessed.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.320
That's how I lifted the prints,
from each of the victims.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.600
And we were able to identify
all the victims that day.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.240
It was truly incredible.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.800
The victims helped me.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.680
That's what I believe.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.720
<i>When we raided his apartment in Sinchon,</i>

27:23.560 --> 27:27.400
we got the confession that he killed
all of his victims in that apartment.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.840
RESTRICTED ENTRY
UNDER INVESTIGATION

27:28.920 --> 27:30.960
<i>You see, this is…</i>

27:31.840 --> 27:35.320
I don't like to talk about this,

27:35.840 --> 27:37.680
but they didn't do anything.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.760
He had already confessed to everything,
and they found the bodies.

27:40.840 --> 27:45.880
So all I had to do as the prosecutor
was to confirm everything.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.720
<i>In my opinion,</i>

27:49.800 --> 27:52.720
a confession means nothing
in a crime investigation.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.640
The most important thing is…

27:56.320 --> 27:57.600
A confession is nothing

27:58.480 --> 28:01.400
without solid evidence to back it up.

28:03.360 --> 28:07.800
I'm not sure if he was a neat freak,

28:07.880 --> 28:09.800
but his place was spotless.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.920
Some time had passed,
so all the blood had been cleaned up.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.920
But we didn't give up.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.440
<i>We turned all the lights off</i>

28:33.040 --> 28:34.640
<i>and sprayed luminol.</i>

28:34.720 --> 28:36.960
<i>It reacts with iron in the blood.</i>

28:37.040 --> 28:40.920
Even if the blood had been washed away,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.080
luminol produces light
when any traces are detected.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.760
<i>So we sprayed it, and there were
glowing bloodstains everywhere.</i>

28:58.640 --> 29:00.280
Then I looked up at the ceiling.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.760
BATHROOM CEILING #4

29:04.840 --> 29:05.960
There was flesh,

29:07.200 --> 29:08.200
blood…

29:08.280 --> 29:09.160
BATHROOM CEILING #1, #2, #3

29:09.840 --> 29:11.760
It was all there. All the spatters.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.840
<i>I saw the blue glow everywhere.
It was quite a sight.</i>

29:18.000 --> 29:20.760
At that moment, I heard someone say

29:21.240 --> 29:24.600
that the devil lives here.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.960
<i>The next thing I noticed
was the toilet paper holder.</i>

29:32.960 --> 29:36.240
When we found the victims,
I noticed that their hair was tied up.

29:37.360 --> 29:41.640
Every single one of them.
Their hair was tied using rubber bands.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.960
I thought it was very unusual

29:44.480 --> 29:45.920
and wondered why.

29:47.240 --> 29:51.280
Yoo's confession answered that question.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.480
<i>After I cut off each victim's head,
I tied their hair up</i>

29:58.560 --> 30:00.560
<i>and hung them from the toilet paper holder</i>

30:00.640 --> 30:02.880
<i>to drain blood.</i>

30:03.960 --> 30:07.000
<i>Then I buried the heads
without removing the rubber bands.</i>

30:11.040 --> 30:13.400
<i>It was heartbreaking.
It wasn't just one person.</i>

30:15.440 --> 30:20.040
Dozens of women were killed
in that bathroom.

30:20.840 --> 30:23.240
The police didn't cordon off
his apartment properly,

30:23.320 --> 30:26.640
so a few reporters sneaked in
and looked through the place.

30:27.760 --> 30:31.640
Among his collection of books,
we found a sketchbook.

30:31.720 --> 30:32.560
FAITH, HOPE, LOVE

30:32.640 --> 30:34.720
<i>And the drawings in it
looked so professional</i>

30:34.800 --> 30:40.000
<i>that I thought
he could have become an artist</i>

30:40.080 --> 30:42.520
<i>had he had proper guidance and support.</i>

30:42.600 --> 30:44.320
I still remember thinking that.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.680
<i>Drawing calms me down,</i>

30:47.760 --> 30:50.200
<i>because I feel like something
that's boiling inside me</i>

30:50.280 --> 30:54.680
<i>leaves my body and gains a new life
when I draw.</i>

30:55.960 --> 30:59.040
<i>Most importantly, it helped me forget
my painful reality albeit momentarily.</i>

30:59.120 --> 31:00.840
<i>That's why I enjoyed drawing.</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:05.640
There was a drawing where he drew himself
in two different ways.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.960
THANKS, EUN-YEONG, EUN-YEONG IS AN IDIOT
I HAVE MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES

31:08.040 --> 31:14.600
One of them was an adorable boy
in a cute outfit.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.000
But right next to that adorable boy,

31:17.600 --> 31:23.360
he also drew the devil
holding a spear like this.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.040
<i>That drawing shows</i>

31:28.120 --> 31:31.280
<i>one of the most notable characteristics
of a serial killer.</i>

31:32.600 --> 31:34.360
His demons come out
when he's committing murder.

31:34.440 --> 31:38.760
He must have known about
the duality of his personality.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.360
<i>As we were leaving his apartment,</i>

31:47.440 --> 31:50.000
we ran into the residents
who came out to see what was going on.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.680
I told one of the residents

31:51.760 --> 31:54.600
that this is where serial killer
Yoo Young-chul lived.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.520
And his jaw dropped.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.040
Then I asked him if he ever noticed
anything out of the ordinary,

32:00.280 --> 32:03.400
<i>and he said the water bills
were on the higher side recently.</i>

32:03.480 --> 32:06.160
In a building like that,

32:06.240 --> 32:09.560
all units split utilities equally,

32:09.640 --> 32:13.400
<i>so he was saying it was probably
due to one unit using a lot of water.</i>

32:18.000 --> 32:21.600
<i>Three members of a family were found dead
with blunt head injuries.</i>

32:21.680 --> 32:24.360
<i>The police have yet to find
the murder weapon,</i>

32:24.440 --> 32:27.440
<i>but based on the large dents
in both victims' heads,</i>

32:27.520 --> 32:29.880
<i>it's highly likely
that a blunt weapon was used.</i>

32:30.440 --> 32:33.360
<i>The killer made sure
to leave no trace of evidence.</i>

32:35.040 --> 32:37.640
<i>"They'll call me soon to consult me."</i>

32:39.000 --> 32:42.680
That's what I thought
as I was watching the news on TV.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.000
<i>Based on Yoo's confession,</i>

32:48.600 --> 32:53.120
<i>we found a sledgehammer near his place.</i>

32:55.760 --> 32:57.760
<i>However,</i>

32:57.840 --> 33:00.480
proving that it was actually
the murder weapon

33:01.560 --> 33:02.640
was an extremely difficult task.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.960
So Yoo's attorney at the time

33:06.040 --> 33:08.720
insisted that he was coaxed

33:08.800 --> 33:11.720
into making a false confession.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.920
<i>It's very risky
to not have any solid evidence</i>

33:15.000 --> 33:17.080
<i>to back up the suspect's confession.</i>

33:17.640 --> 33:22.160
If they'd found no DNA evidence
on the hammer,

33:22.640 --> 33:28.920
and if Yoo had retracted his confession
during his trial,

33:29.000 --> 33:34.240
things would have gotten very complicated.

33:36.120 --> 33:40.240
<i>We had to find something</i>

33:40.320 --> 33:43.840
<i>to prove that he was the killer.</i>

33:44.800 --> 33:49.920
To tell you the truth, I wasn't
100 percent confident about everything.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.640
It was a specialized tool.

33:57.720 --> 34:01.200
Because the head is so heavy,

34:01.280 --> 34:03.760
it originally had a long handle.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.640
<i>But he cut it to make it shorter.</i>

34:06.720 --> 34:08.680
<i>So the shape itself was unique.</i>

34:10.320 --> 34:12.560
He developed the murder weapon himself

34:13.040 --> 34:16.760
to fit his grip perfectly.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.719
<i>That was one of the most
unusual things about him.</i>

34:20.440 --> 34:22.920
And he must have felt
a sense of accomplishment

34:23.000 --> 34:26.880
while making his one-of-a-kind tool.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.080
<i>It became an interesting project for him.</i>

34:30.159 --> 34:31.960
<i>It almost became his job.</i>

34:32.639 --> 34:34.400
<i>"I should check out this area today."</i>

34:34.480 --> 34:36.800
<i>Then he'd leave the house
armed with his tools and weapons</i>

34:36.880 --> 34:38.400
<i>as if he was going to work.</i>

34:42.400 --> 34:46.600
You can clearly see the same shape.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.360
They're imprints of the hammer,

34:50.440 --> 34:52.040
this sledgehammer.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.560
You see, right here. It matches.

34:55.639 --> 35:00.800
It's not an exact match,
because the scalp has some elasticity,

35:01.280 --> 35:02.680
it can swell and shrink.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.320
We confirmed that the shape matched,

35:05.880 --> 35:09.320
but this wasn't enough evidence.

35:09.400 --> 35:13.640
Without DNA evidence,
the police couldn't conclude

35:14.560 --> 35:16.800
that this was the murder weapon.

35:20.280 --> 35:23.320
You can never remove blood completely
even if you wipe it off

35:23.400 --> 35:27.800
because it begins to clot immediately

35:27.880 --> 35:30.560
once it's smeared onto something.

35:30.640 --> 35:34.040
The proteins begin to clot,

35:34.120 --> 35:37.440
and once albumin binds to globulins,

35:37.520 --> 35:39.240
it obtains this glue-like consistency.

35:39.320 --> 35:40.600
It becomes very sticky.

35:43.160 --> 35:46.520
<i>It won't wash out completely with water.</i>

35:46.600 --> 35:48.960
<i>So I figured the DNA evidence
should still be intact.</i>

35:50.600 --> 35:52.200
We scraped it with a knife.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.440
Gently like this.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.680
Then we scraped off

35:58.520 --> 36:01.520
additional samples from here, like this.

36:01.600 --> 36:06.520
We collected samples from each part

36:06.600 --> 36:08.720
and sent them in for testing.

36:23.520 --> 36:29.720
The prosecutor called me the next day
with the results.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.680
This is what he said to me at the end.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.320
"I knew it.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.280
We got it!"

36:40.520 --> 36:43.960
I'd say it was the biggest smoking gun.

36:44.520 --> 36:47.080
It helped us establish the credibility
of his confessions

36:47.160 --> 36:51.000
regarding all the cases involving him,
not just this specific case,

36:51.080 --> 36:53.120
so it played a crucial role
in the investigation.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.240
THE DNA EVIDENCE FOUND ON THE
SLEDGEHAMMER HELPED THE POLICE

37:02.320 --> 37:06.760
CONNECT YOO TO THE
UNRESOLVED MURDER OF AHN JAE-SEON,

37:08.680 --> 37:12.960
A VENDOR WHO WAS FOUND DEAD
IN A BURNT VAN IN WOLMIDO, INCHEON

37:13.040 --> 37:16.840
The Wolmido case was an unusual one.

37:17.640 --> 37:21.640
It was quite different
from Yoo's MO we had seen previously.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.640
The police have found another victim
of this shocking serial murder case,

37:26.720 --> 37:28.080
bringing the total number
of victims to 20.

37:28.160 --> 37:31.640
The victim in Incheon wasn't female
or a bourgeoisie. Why did you do it?

37:32.280 --> 37:34.320
He found out that I wasn't a real police.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.280
I think Yoo's goal was
to extort money from him.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.520
When Yoo showed the man
his fake police ID,

37:39.600 --> 37:40.560
he got scared.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.200
<i>But he thought it was suspicious,
so he asked Yoo,</i>

37:43.280 --> 37:45.080
<i>"Are you really a police officer?"</i>

37:45.160 --> 37:47.960
So Yoo thought, "I can't let him off.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.760
I was going to just take his money
and let him go,

37:51.840 --> 37:54.720
but he keeps suspecting me
and provoking me.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.680
I should just get rid of him
since he's seen my face."

37:58.760 --> 38:00.600
Impersonating a police officer.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.880
That was his job.

38:03.440 --> 38:09.600
That's what he did to make ends meet.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.400
<i>Afraid that the handcuffs
would leave marks,</i>

38:12.480 --> 38:15.080
<i>Yoo cut off the victim's hands
and threw them into the sea</i>

38:15.160 --> 38:16.600
<i>before setting the van on fire.</i>

38:17.920 --> 38:21.000
How could someone do this
to another human being?

38:21.080 --> 38:23.080
It's beyond cruel.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.680
I couldn't even recognize
my husband's face.

38:39.840 --> 38:42.680
My brother and I met up often
to catch up over meals.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.720
I visited my brother often.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.000
What that bastard did to my brother…

38:50.920 --> 38:56.360
He brutally murdered my older brother.

38:57.400 --> 39:02.160
My brother's face was stabbed
so many times

39:03.000 --> 39:05.200
that none of the flesh remained.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.640
And it was burnt.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.720
His torso and limbs were completely burnt.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.120
His body was twisted like this.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.400
He looked like a scorched dead animal.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.040
It made my blood boil.
I wanted to kill him.

39:20.120 --> 39:23.280
The day the police brought him
to the scene, I went there with a knife

39:24.880 --> 39:26.280
to kill that bastard.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.080
I ran at him to do it,

39:37.160 --> 39:39.080
but the cops stopped me.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.600
Over here!

39:40.680 --> 39:43.800
They said, "We understand
how furious and devastated you must be,

39:43.880 --> 39:45.800
but what's the point?"

39:56.920 --> 39:59.280
So I even attempted suicide many times.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.400
One day, I went up to the mountains
to take my own life.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.320
I started drinking soju.

40:04.400 --> 40:08.160
I was so devastated that I wanted
to just drink soju and end my life.

40:08.960 --> 40:12.960
But suddenly, I heard
some whining noise coming from a box.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.160
My gosh…

40:16.720 --> 40:19.360
Someone had abandoned a dog in the woods.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.400
When I saw that, my heart broke.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.560
So the dog…

40:23.640 --> 40:25.160
I brought the dog home.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.600
That moment, I changed my mind
and decided not to end my life.

40:28.680 --> 40:32.080
Down. Say hello.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.800
<i>Back then,
the public and even the government</i>

40:41.880 --> 40:43.920
had a very limited understanding

40:44.000 --> 40:48.200
of the emotional pain and trauma

40:48.280 --> 40:52.160
that crime victims
and their families experience.

40:52.240 --> 40:55.480
The victims' families didn't receive
any sort of compensation,

40:56.840 --> 40:58.520
<i>which was why I wanted</i>

40:58.600 --> 41:03.200
to do something for the victims
and their families.

41:03.280 --> 41:05.840
That's how I got into this.

41:08.520 --> 41:10.520
<i>I went to the US and the UK
and learned a lot</i>

41:10.600 --> 41:13.240
from their systems

41:13.320 --> 41:15.280
and victim support programs and services.

41:15.360 --> 41:19.960
I did a lot of research on the strategies
and approaches to supporting crime victims

41:21.480 --> 41:24.680
<i>which has helped us improve
our support programs and services.</i>

41:24.760 --> 41:28.520
So compared to then,
we've come a long way.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.880
Yoo Young-chul has confessed
to 26 killings,

41:39.960 --> 41:43.520
including the Southwestern Murders.

41:43.600 --> 41:47.600
At the time, there were
a number of cold cases

41:47.680 --> 41:49.440
in our jurisdictions in Seoul.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.840
Unsolved murder cases.

41:50.920 --> 41:51.800
SEOUL SOUTHWESTERN MURDERS

41:51.880 --> 41:55.240
A number of motiveless murders occurred
in the southwestern region of Seoul.

41:55.320 --> 41:58.640
The killer would target women
who were walking alone

41:58.720 --> 42:03.320
and attack them with a knife
or a blunt weapon from behind

42:04.080 --> 42:06.400
and kill them for no reason and run away.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.160
These cases remained unsolved.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.560
The most famous one
was the Imun-dong Murder.

42:12.480 --> 42:17.080
<i>A woman who was working
at Dongdaemun Market at the time</i>

42:17.160 --> 42:21.520
<i>was attacked for no reason
as she was leaving her place in Imun-dong</i>

42:22.000 --> 42:24.160
when it was getting dark.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.680
She was beaten to death.

42:28.240 --> 42:32.240
<i>All we had was Yoo's confession.</i>

42:32.800 --> 42:37.600
Because the Imun-dong case
was quite different from his other cases,

42:37.680 --> 42:40.400
I asked him many times
during the investigation

42:40.480 --> 42:45.120
if he was making

42:45.200 --> 42:48.680
a false confession.

42:48.760 --> 42:52.120
But every time I asked him,
he insisted that he did it,

42:52.200 --> 42:55.280
so that murder was added
to his charges as well.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.280
On my way to the on-scene investigation
of the Imun-dong case,

43:00.360 --> 43:03.480
I noticed something very troubling.

43:03.560 --> 43:06.360
How should I put this?

43:06.440 --> 43:09.400
The police seemed to be enjoying
all the attention.

43:10.680 --> 43:11.920
<i>On their way there,</i>

43:12.000 --> 43:15.440
they sped through the city,

43:15.520 --> 43:17.080
ignoring the traffic lights.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.400
<i>But that was unnecessary.</i>

43:19.480 --> 43:21.480
<i>Usually, the police
set everything up quietly</i>

43:21.560 --> 43:23.040
<i>and just take a few reporters.</i>

43:23.120 --> 43:26.120
<i>It could have been done without disrupting</i>

43:26.200 --> 43:28.800
the citizens' everyday life.

43:29.600 --> 43:33.000
<i>But when we got there,
there were reporters and cars everywhere.</i>

43:33.080 --> 43:35.800
All the cars were illegally parked
along the road,

43:35.880 --> 43:37.720
and the reporters
came running to cover it.

43:37.800 --> 43:41.240
It was packed with people,
so there was all this pushing and pulling.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.560
The situation was out of control.

43:43.640 --> 43:44.840
The residents came out

43:44.920 --> 43:47.080
and cursed at him, calling him a murderer.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.640
"Why are they doing it this way?"

43:51.280 --> 43:53.080
I couldn't wrap my head around it.

43:53.760 --> 43:55.120
Was her hair long or short?

43:55.200 --> 43:56.480
It was long.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.680
Can you reenact how you stabbed her?

43:58.760 --> 44:00.240
It's the same.

44:00.320 --> 44:03.640
The detectives dragged him around
and asked him,

44:03.720 --> 44:05.360
"You did this, right? This too?"

44:05.440 --> 44:09.640
So he just went along with it
and kept saying yes.

44:09.720 --> 44:12.040
So this case was added to his charges.

44:14.480 --> 44:16.880
It was my fault.

44:16.960 --> 44:19.600
I should have called
the detectives out on it

44:19.680 --> 44:21.520
and told them to be more careful.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.160
I do regret not doing so.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.000
In that regard,

44:25.080 --> 44:27.280
I was partly to blame for it.

44:29.960 --> 44:34.800
<i>I was confident that I could get him
acquitted on the Imun-dong case.</i>

44:35.480 --> 44:38.760
<i>I could tell right away
that it wasn't him.</i>

44:38.840 --> 44:44.760
Yoo always strikes his victims

44:44.840 --> 44:46.360
in the head first

44:46.440 --> 44:50.080
<i>with his hammer,</i>

44:50.160 --> 44:54.840
whereas the Imun-dong victim
was stabbed in multiple areas.

44:54.920 --> 44:56.520
There was a story going around.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.040
The police wouldn't be happy
if they heard this,

44:59.120 --> 45:02.360
but I heard that
an officer at a police precinct

45:02.440 --> 45:08.840
told Yoo that they'd take care of his son
until he graduates from college

45:08.920 --> 45:14.560
if he pleaded guilty
in regard to this specific case.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.240
<i>The Imun-dong case.</i>

45:18.320 --> 45:20.160
<i>Yes, I admit that I was shortsighted.</i>

45:21.760 --> 45:24.840
<i>I thought it was
the last thing I could do for my son.</i>

45:25.800 --> 45:27.080
<i>Think about it.</i>

45:27.160 --> 45:30.000
<i>They said they'd take care of my child
until he graduates from college.</i>

45:32.400 --> 45:34.560
<i>The police have concluded that
Yoo Young-chul killed 21 victims in total.</i>

45:34.640 --> 45:38.200
The case has now been passed on
to the prosecution.

45:39.480 --> 45:44.240
His transfer
from Yeongdeungpo Police Station

45:44.320 --> 45:47.160
to our facilities
was being broadcast live that day.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.720
<i>Because he had gotten away once
from the Mobile Investigation Unit,</i>

45:50.800 --> 45:52.640
<i>I sent the entire team of 120 officers.</i>

45:52.720 --> 45:54.280
<i>We had to keep a close eye on him.</i>

45:55.880 --> 45:57.640
After about two minutes,

45:57.720 --> 45:59.680
a woman showed up out of nowhere.

45:59.760 --> 46:03.040
She came up the stairs holding an umbrella
and tried to take his hat off.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.440
Mr. Yoo. Please, give us a word.

46:13.520 --> 46:16.480
My daughter would be alive
if you caught him in January!

46:17.520 --> 46:20.720
That was being broadcast live,

46:20.800 --> 46:22.520
and it looked like

46:23.200 --> 46:24.440
the police

46:25.480 --> 46:26.480
ruthlessly…

46:28.120 --> 46:29.560
kicked the victim's mother.

46:31.160 --> 46:35.920
<i>I wanted to give her a big hug
and apologize to her.</i>

46:36.000 --> 46:39.360
<i>I wanted to say,
"Ma'am, we're really sorry.</i>

46:39.440 --> 46:43.600
I understand we've done more harm
than good."

46:43.680 --> 46:48.520
I really wanted to apologize to her

46:49.200 --> 46:50.160
but couldn't.

46:51.160 --> 46:54.040
<i>The police kicking the victim's mother
caused an uproar,</i>

46:54.520 --> 46:56.640
so a number of officers were reprimanded,

46:56.720 --> 47:00.560
and the media
harshly criticized the police.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.680
<i>From what I remember, Chief Kang Dae-won</i>

47:06.760 --> 47:08.360
had been waiting for a promotion

47:08.440 --> 47:11.080
and was next in line for promotion
at the time

47:11.160 --> 47:14.560
because Mobile Investigation
is an important unit.

47:15.080 --> 47:18.080
<i>However, his promotion fell through.</i>

47:21.360 --> 47:23.840
-Would you care to comment?
-It wasn't planned, was it?

47:23.920 --> 47:26.160
-Jeez. Which station are you from?
-Who are you here to see today?

47:26.240 --> 47:31.440
We solved a huge case,
but all our hard work went up in smoke.

47:32.920 --> 47:36.000
And because I was in charge,

47:37.200 --> 47:40.120
I was reprimanded and demoted.

47:41.680 --> 47:48.240
It was ridiculous.
I still can't believe I went through that.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.760
We sincerely apologize

47:56.840 --> 48:01.440
for the police's failure
to competently handle the case

48:01.920 --> 48:04.760
in its initial stages,

48:04.840 --> 48:08.480
which resulted in more victims.

48:09.040 --> 48:09.920
<i>The police…</i>

48:10.000 --> 48:13.400
<i>I have to say, they were incompetent.</i>

48:13.480 --> 48:16.760
I'll be honest.
If it weren't for Yoo Young-chul…

48:16.840 --> 48:19.240
That is the one contribution Yoo made
to society.

48:20.800 --> 48:23.280
He brought important changes
to our social system.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.880
Thanks to this,
many things changed for the better.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.440
The police will be conducting
an internal investigation

48:28.520 --> 48:31.800
on the Mobile Investigation Unit
at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

48:31.880 --> 48:35.240
<i>The officials stated that
it will be focused on the loopholes</i>

48:35.320 --> 48:37.840
<i>in the investigation of the Yoo Young-chul
case which has caused heated controversy.</i>

48:37.920 --> 48:40.520
Since then, the whole system has changed.

48:40.600 --> 48:43.960
It has completely changed
because of that incident.

48:44.040 --> 48:46.520
Forensic technology,
procedures with proven efficacy,

48:46.600 --> 48:48.560
and the detectives' investigation skills.

48:48.640 --> 48:52.560
When these things come together,

48:52.640 --> 48:55.320
we can solve cases swiftly with ease.

48:55.400 --> 48:57.080
I'm pretty sure

48:57.160 --> 49:00.840
no other country in the world
is as good as we are at solving cases.

49:00.920 --> 49:01.920
But…

49:04.240 --> 49:06.960
I don't think many Koreans know that.

49:07.040 --> 49:11.480
<i>Whenever there's media coverage
on a few corrupt cops,</i>

49:11.560 --> 49:14.000
<i>people harshly criticize the police.</i>

49:14.600 --> 49:16.280
But South Korea is very safe,

49:16.360 --> 49:19.480
and all the police officers
work extremely hard.

49:20.080 --> 49:22.880
Nowadays, most murder cases in Seoul

49:22.960 --> 49:26.400
are solved.

49:26.480 --> 49:28.960
In one year,
the clearance rate was 100 percent.

49:29.040 --> 49:32.120
I'd say it hovers around 97, 98,
or 98,5 percent on average.

49:33.040 --> 49:37.280
IN DECEMBER 2004, YOO YOUNG-CHUL
WAS CONVICTED OF 20 MURDERS

49:37.360 --> 49:40.040
AND WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH

49:41.240 --> 49:43.280
HE WAS ACQUITED OF THE IMUN-DONG MURDER

49:43.360 --> 49:46.160
AND WAS CLEARED OF ANY INVOLVEMENT
IN THE SOUTHWESTERN MURDERS

49:47.400 --> 49:51.840
HE IS STILL CURRENTLY ON DEATH ROW

49:53.840 --> 49:55.960
The Seoul Central District Court

49:56.040 --> 49:59.440
sentenced serial killer
Yoo Young-chul to death

49:59.520 --> 50:01.160
<i>for murdering 21 victims,</i>

50:01.240 --> 50:02.880
<i>including senior citizens and women.</i>

50:02.960 --> 50:05.640
<i>The Court stated that
he was sentenced to death</i>

50:05.720 --> 50:07.440
<i>based on the heinous nature of his crimes</i>

50:07.520 --> 50:10.480
<i>and the shock he inflicted on society</i>

50:10.560 --> 50:13.720
<i>as well as the bereaved.</i>

50:19.080 --> 50:22.320
<i>I can't talk about my career in forensics
without mentioning Yoo's case.</i>

50:23.880 --> 50:26.880
I work on many homicide cases,

50:26.960 --> 50:29.560
and of course it's stressful.
It's certainly not easy.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.280
But I've managed to stay strong

50:32.360 --> 50:34.080
and always do my best

50:34.160 --> 50:37.360
because I've witnessed firsthand

50:37.440 --> 50:40.960
the devastating pain and sadness
of the bereaved families

50:41.040 --> 50:43.400
at crime scenes.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.680
CAPTAIN KIM HEE-SOOK IS NOW DIRECTOR
OF FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

50:46.760 --> 50:48.520
AT THE SEOUL METROPOLITAN
POLICE AGENCY AND OVERSEES

50:48.600 --> 50:50.280
ALL INVESTIGATIONS AS AN
EXPERT IN FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION

50:50.360 --> 50:51.880
SHE IS NO LONGER THE ONLY WOMAN
ON HER TEAM

50:52.880 --> 50:57.280
<i>I think I'm a mentally strong person,</i>

50:57.840 --> 50:59.840
<i>but I still think about it
from time to time.</i>

51:01.240 --> 51:03.600
<i>It hits you later, out of the blue.</i>

51:05.200 --> 51:08.880
I wonder if the others are
also traumatized like I am.

51:09.960 --> 51:16.160
LIEUTENANT YANG PIL-JOO NOW WORKS
AT DONGDAEMUN POLICE STATION IN SEOUL

51:17.440 --> 51:20.440
Everyone forgets about things

51:21.400 --> 51:23.720
that happened years ago,

51:24.240 --> 51:27.000
but I hope people never forget this case

51:27.080 --> 51:30.720
because I don't want anyone else
to experience something like that.

51:30.800 --> 51:35.880
What that bastard did
left so many families shattered.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.560
The bereaved families.

51:38.040 --> 51:41.560
Thankfully, I have people helping me.

51:42.040 --> 51:44.520
I don't want to let them down,

51:44.600 --> 51:46.640
<i>so I want to be kind to others</i>

51:48.040 --> 51:50.560
and give back

51:50.640 --> 51:52.960
until the day I die.

51:53.040 --> 51:56.000
AHN JAE-SAM'S TWO BROTHERS
TOOK THEIR OWN LIVES

51:56.080 --> 51:58.440
AFTER YOO YOUNG-CHUL'S TRIAL

51:58.520 --> 52:02.200
THE KOREA CRIME VICTIM SUPPORT CENTER
CONTINUES TO SUPPORT HIM

52:03.640 --> 52:06.800
<i>I interviewed him
when he was in the holding cell</i>

52:06.880 --> 52:09.360
<i>after confessing to the murders
for the first time,</i>

52:10.960 --> 52:15.360
<i>to find out his motives and profile him.</i>

52:15.440 --> 52:18.880
<i>I don't think his character traits
or natural tendencies have changed at all.</i>

52:20.560 --> 52:23.160
<i>The biggest reason that detectives</i>

52:23.240 --> 52:27.760
<i>and the CSI members
or profilers like myself</i>

52:27.840 --> 52:30.960
<i>who are the first to arrive
at crime scenes</i>

52:31.040 --> 52:34.440
continue on in this line of work

52:34.520 --> 52:39.000
is because we witness firsthand

52:39.480 --> 52:43.040
the victims who did not deserve
to have their lives taken from them.

52:44.640 --> 52:48.760
<i>It's not just about the job
or our sense of duty.</i>

52:48.840 --> 52:50.880
<i>The respect for life,</i>

52:50.960 --> 52:53.520
the love for others,

52:54.240 --> 52:57.840
<i>and the hope of making this world
a more just place</i>

52:57.920 --> 53:00.520
<i>make this work much more than just a job</i>

53:00.600 --> 53:05.920
and give us a reason to devote our lives

53:06.680 --> 53:08.000
to this field.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.680
WITH EXPERIENCE GAINED
FROM THE YOUNG-CHUL CASE,

53:09.760 --> 53:11.760
