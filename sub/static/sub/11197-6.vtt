00:05.800 --> 00:08.480
Previously on ''Stargate SG-1'';

00:08.560 --> 00:10.160
He's burning up.

00:10.240 --> 00:16.800
The virus acts like cerebrospinal
meningitis, by attacking the brain.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.120
The symbiote Kanan
is someone l know well.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.920
l have no doubt that he would blend with
O'Neill, cure him and leave him again,

00:24.040 --> 00:26.160
if another suitable host can be found.

00:26.280 --> 00:29.600
Sir, the symbiote's host died
while they were on a mission.

00:29.680 --> 00:33.680
The Tok'ra have reason to believe the
symbiote has vital information to reveal

00:33.760 --> 00:35.760
and this would give him that chance.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.080
Sir, please.

01:04.519 --> 01:06.480
It's too far.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.080
I can't.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.200
Hide here until
the Chaapa-ai is activated. Go.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.800
Argh

01:59.200 --> 02:01.360
Shek'mal, Tok'ra.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.640
Kree

02:04.760 --> 02:07.360
Jaffa, shal kek.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.840
The host lives, my lord.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.280
- lt's the Tok'ra.
- lt's about damn time.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.560
Stand down.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.040
- General Hammond.
- Councillor Thoran.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.560
l'm afraid my patience on this matter
has just about run out.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.280
You've been promising the safe return
of Colonel O'Neill for days.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.400
Where is he?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.840
l'm afraid l am the bearer of bad news.

04:37.800 --> 04:42.160
And he just walked out of your base?
Nobody noticed until it was too late?

04:42.240 --> 04:46.160
With the attack on Revanna, our numbers
have been severely diminished.

04:46.280 --> 04:51.000
We had no reason to expect this.
l see no reason to assign blame.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.280
Colonel O'Neill put his life in your hands.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.560
- The symbiote was his only hope for life.
- He could have refused.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.360
ln which case you'd never have
retrieved the knowledge in Kanan's mind.

05:01.480 --> 05:06.280
- A more than fair exchange.
- O'Neill would not agree to a blending

05:06.400 --> 05:08.840
unless there was
more at stake than his life.

05:08.960 --> 05:14.160
Perhaps the repugnance of blending with
another mind caused him to be irrational.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.200
l can't speculate on
Colonel O'Neill's state of mind,

05:17.320 --> 05:21.000
but while a mature symbiote can take
control of the host when it wants to,

05:21.080 --> 05:23.200
it doesn't work both ways.

05:23.320 --> 05:27.360
l can vouch for that, sir. There is no way
he could have walked out on his own.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.640
Then he was forced to do so
against his will by the symbiote.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.960
You accuse an honoured Tok'ra
of behaving as a Goa'uld.

05:35.040 --> 05:35.920
Councillor...

05:36.000 --> 05:39.200
Kanan has fought the Goa'uld
longer than you have lived,

05:39.280 --> 05:43.440
yet you spit the word ''symbiote''
as though you spoke of vermin.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.760
Whatever you may think of our form,
Kanan was as a brother to me.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.800
The Tok'ra Council accepts
that Kanan may be lost to us.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.520
That's the big difference
between us, Councillor.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.000
We don't leave our people behind.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.280
- Who are you?
- You go first.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.960
- You claim you do not know me.
- Well, take no offence there, Skippy.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.000
l'm sure you're a real
hot, important Goa'uld.

07:12.080 --> 07:16.240
l've just always been kind of
out of the loop with the snake thing.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.640
l am Baal.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.160
That's it?

07:20.240 --> 07:23.200
Just ''Ball''?

07:24.880 --> 07:26.880
As in ''boccie''?

07:29.080 --> 07:32.720
Do you not know the pain
you will suffer for this impudence?

07:32.840 --> 07:35.440
l don't know the meaning of the word.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.360
Seriously. ''lmpudence''.
What does that mean?

07:48.880 --> 07:50.880
I shall begin again.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.160
- Who are you?
- Colonel Jack O'Neill, US Air Force.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.880
- Two Ls.
- That may be who you once were, Tok'ra.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.320
l may be a lot of things, but l'm no Tok'ra.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.240
lt is true we were only able
to capture the host.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.240
Your symbiote fled the body
out of cowardice.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.520
But it is also true the Tok'ra
share body and mind equally.

08:11.600 --> 08:16.080
- You will know all that it knew.
- l think l know less than you think l know.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.480
Why have you come to this outpost?

08:21.600 --> 08:24.800
Now, you see, that's
a perfect example right there.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.640
I haven't a clue.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.640
- You have been here before.
- First time.

08:40.760 --> 08:44.159
You know your way to and from
my secret outpost. You've been here.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.520
- What?
- Did you really hope to escape my guard?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.600
- What?
- Why did you abduct my slave?

08:49.680 --> 08:51.640
All right, look...

08:52.480 --> 08:55.480
This is the last thing l remember,
l swear to God.

08:56.960 --> 09:03.480
l was sick. l agreed to let the Tok'ra put
a snake in my head or l would have died.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.120
Right now l'm kinda wishing l had.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.720
A wish easily granted.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.800
- What was your mission?
- No mission.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.240
- Why have you returned?
- l've never been here.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.680
- What did you want with the female?
- What female?

09:20.120 --> 09:22.400
Death will only offer a temporary escape.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.520
l can revive you again and again.
A thousand times if need be.

09:26.640 --> 09:31.680
Only once you have told me everything
l ask will you be allowed to die

09:31.800 --> 09:35.840
one... last... time.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.800
Where was his last mission?

09:38.920 --> 09:41.920
As an operative aboard a mothership
in Zipacna's fleet.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.080
He managed to escape during a battle
with Lord Yu's forces, but just barely.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.440
- Did he have a motive to return?
- Such as?

09:49.520 --> 09:52.080
Unfinished business? A task left undone?

09:52.200 --> 09:55.360
His report stated
the mission objectives were complete.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.520
We will attempt contact
with our operatives on these worlds

09:58.640 --> 10:01.600
- here, here and here.
- His previous missions.

10:01.680 --> 10:06.560
lf Kanan returned for whatever reason,
our operatives may have learned of it.

10:06.680 --> 10:10.080
- When will we hear news?
- lt may take many months.

10:11.680 --> 10:15.040
- You spoke of Kanan's mission reports.
- What of it?

10:15.120 --> 10:20.720
We'd like to see them. lf Kanan had
unfinished business, there may be clues.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.040
- Their contents are not relevant.
- Colonel O'Neill's life is at stake.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.840
What you ask is not possible.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.200
Really?

11:18.520 --> 11:20.720
ls it you?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.200
Hi, Jack.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.360
Daniel.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.560
I leave, and look at the mess
you get yourself into.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.120
It's good to see you.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.320
Yeah.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.240
You, too.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.200
lt's a shame you're a delusion.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.120
No, l'm here. l'm really here.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.600
Sure you are.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.480
Here in the sense that my consciousness
is here, if not here in the physical sense.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.960
The point is you're not imagining this.

12:23.040 --> 12:27.360
- l just tossed my shoe through you.
- l ascended to another plane of existence.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.080
- Oh.
- Oma Desala, the whole glowing thing.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.560
l couldn't have done it
without you. Remember?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.560
Yeah.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.920
l'm... l'm energy now.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.200
- How's that workin' out for you?
- Good, actually. Very...

12:41.280 --> 12:43.360
- Good.
- Very good.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.040
- You, however...
- Yeah, well.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.240
You know what it's like
coming back from the dead.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.040
Takes a while to get the colour
back in the cheeks.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.400
Yeah.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.200
So...

13:07.040 --> 13:09.680
- Not a delusion?
- No.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.280
OK. Show me your stuff.
Bust me outta here.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.440
- l can't.
- Why not?

13:15.520 --> 13:18.480
- l'm not allowed to interfere.
- You're interfering now.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
- l'm not.
- You are.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.320
No, l'm not. l am consoling a friend.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.120
What good's the power
to make the wind blow

13:25.240 --> 13:27.280
if you can't spring a friend from jail?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.760
- l would if l could.
- You can't do that stuff?

13:29.880 --> 13:31.680
l can, l just... l can't.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.480
Well, thanks for stoppin' by.

13:34.600 --> 13:38.360
Baal is torturing you
and l wasn't just gonna sit by.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.000
Look, all he wants to know
is the reason you came to this planet.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.400
- You really don't know?
- Do you?

13:44.480 --> 13:49.360
All l know is that you, or, more accurately,
the symbiote the Tok'ra placed in you -

13:49.480 --> 13:54.480
congratulations, by the way - walked off
in the middle of the night and came here.

13:54.600 --> 13:59.760
l can't believe l actually let them put a
snake in my head. My head. l agreed to it.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.360
lt never shared with you
why it'd walk into a Goa'uld outpost?

14:03.440 --> 14:07.040
- There was no sharing. l was sick.
- l know.

14:07.160 --> 14:12.080
They did the implantation - a word l intend
never to use again - and l woke up here.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.320
That's my week so far.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.560
So you really don't know.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.960
Something to do with
one of Baal's slaves.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.400
l've got a visual,
but l've never met her before.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.640
Nobody knows you're here.

14:33.160 --> 14:38.240
Even if they did, they couldn't pull off
a rescue because this place is a fortress.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.360
Baal will keep torturing you to death
and reviving you

14:41.440 --> 14:46.560
until he finds out what he wants, which
is impossible because you know nothing,

14:46.640 --> 14:49.840
or until you're not
worth reviving any more.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.840
But you'll cease to be the Jack O'Neill
we know long before that.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.280
Well, apparently
l've got a big day tomorrow.

14:59.720 --> 15:04.000
- No, l won't let him destroy you.
- You just said you couldn't help.

15:04.120 --> 15:09.200
l can't stop Baal torturing you any more
than Oma could heal my radiation, but...

15:10.760 --> 15:13.120
l can help you ascend.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.560
Your underlings
will not allow me to leave.

15:22.640 --> 15:27.560
- My officers are following my orders.
- This Jaffa threatened my life.

15:27.680 --> 15:32.400
l merely informed you that any attempt to
activate the Stargate will result in injury.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.760
- Then l am a prisoner?
- l'd prefer you consider yourself a guest.

15:35.880 --> 15:39.560
You can leave once you give us
the mission reports we've requested,

15:39.680 --> 15:41.520
under Article 9 of our treaty.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.880
Such a request to the Council
must be made in person.

15:44.960 --> 15:50.000
Why's that? This control facility can
relay a request on multiple frequencies,

15:50.120 --> 15:52.080
including those used by the Tok'ra.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.040
lf you choose not to
avail yourself of that capability,

15:55.120 --> 16:00.720
we'd be pleased to give you comfortable
quarters until you change your mind.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.800
You threaten the peaceful continuation
of relations between our peoples.

16:04.920 --> 16:09.920
lf our relations continue in the direction
they're going, l don't give a damn.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.960
Very well. l will make your request
that the reports be sent here immediately.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.200
Thank you.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.320
So you wanna be my Oma?

16:34.480 --> 16:38.480
You could put it that way. l mean,
l wouldn't, but maybe that's just me.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.760
- And then what?
- Then... Then l don't know.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.000
- You don't know?
- No, no.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.440
Ascension doesn't make you
all-knowing. l really don't know.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.440
lf l'm catching a plane of existence,
you gotta give me something.

16:51.520 --> 16:55.520
lt's your journey. No one but you chooses
what you become or the path you take.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.040
All l can promise you is
it will be an amazing journey.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.480
- Once you release your burden.
- Daniel, if you start talking like Oma...

17:04.560 --> 17:07.200
- l'm not talking like Oma.
- Sounds like Oma to me.

17:07.319 --> 17:11.520
Oma'd say ''lf you know the candlelight
is fire, the meal was cooked a while ago'',

17:11.599 --> 17:13.200
or something like that.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.560
Why?

17:15.680 --> 17:17.839
To open your mind.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.880
Though a candle burns in my house,
there's nobody home.

17:24.480 --> 17:28.240
OK. Let's take this one step at a time.

17:28.319 --> 17:31.920
This has to be something you want.
l can't do this for you.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.760
- One step at a time.
- One step at a time.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.920
- There's gotta be another way out.
- Jack...

17:43.040 --> 17:45.920
- What if you did a little scouting for me?
- No.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.600
- Not knocking down walls, just a recon.
- Baal will torture you again.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.080
- Help me get my hands on a zat gun.
- Next time'll be worse.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.080
- That's when we move.
- You can't fight your way out.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.760
- Then help me
- Not that way.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.200
They're coming.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.760
- They can see you. We can use that.
- l'll be back.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.480
- A distraction. That's all l need.
- l promise.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.400
Daniel.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.560
- His motive had to be personal.
- For what reason?

18:43.600 --> 18:46.640
The Tok'ra claim all of Kanan's
spy missions were a success,

18:46.720 --> 18:48.880
so he'd have no reason to go back.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.320
lf we take them at their word,
we can rule out any logical reason.

18:52.400 --> 18:57.040
Kanan had to be motivated
by something profound enough

18:57.120 --> 19:00.880
to not only risk his life,
but also the life of his host.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.400
The acid will take time
to burn through all the way.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.080
Though it cauterises the flesh as it burns,

19:22.200 --> 19:27.280
a very small amount often finds its way
into the blood and begins to spread.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.240
- Why have you returned here, Tok'ra?
- l'm human.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.040
- Betrayed by your symbiote.
- lt used me.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.400
- To do what?
- l don't know, and l don't care

19:36.480 --> 19:40.160
- What did the symbiote call itself?
- l don't remember.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.840
Tok'ra retain the identities
of both host and symbiote.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.120
You are O'Neill.
What was the name of your symbiote?

19:47.240 --> 19:49.440
l... l just told you.

19:50.520 --> 19:54.120
What Tok'ra secrets
could a single name reveal?

19:54.240 --> 19:55.360
l don't know.

19:55.440 --> 19:59.120
Why protect the one who betrayed you?
Abandoned you to this?

19:59.240 --> 20:02.480
lf l knew the name,
l'd give you the damn name.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.520
l don't care about protecting the Tok'ra.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.680
- Tok'ra have been a nuisance for years.
- Don't.

20:09.800 --> 20:13.760
Even when we thought they'd been
wiped out, they'd become more insidious.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.840
Like acid,
burrowing holes into our empires.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.920
Kanan.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
That's the name.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.880
Kanan.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.000
l... l just told you.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.200
Yes. You did.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.560
This neutralises the acid
and numbs the pain.

20:59.680 --> 21:03.520
So, you see, the truth is rewarded.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.440
l don't know anything else.

21:06.560 --> 21:11.200
There may be much more of this Kanan
still in your memory than even you know.

21:11.320 --> 21:14.440
lt'll come to you... in time.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.440
Agh

21:30.640 --> 21:32.800
ls it you?

21:35.680 --> 21:37.680
What?

21:37.760 --> 21:39.760
You shouldn't have come back.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.800
l don't... remember.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.680
lf l leave with you, he will know.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.760
You...

21:55.600 --> 21:58.240
Jack, who are you talking to?

22:00.280 --> 22:02.240
The woman.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.960
There's nobody there.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.120
Look who's talking.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.880
Does it still hurt?

22:24.800 --> 22:26.080
No.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.800
l told you l'd come back.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.160
lf the Daniel Jackson l knew
was really here...

22:32.280 --> 22:34.960
- l am.
- Then do something.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.240
You listen to me.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.320
l don't wanna go through that again.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.960
lf you were really my friend
and had the power to stop it, you'd stop it.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.320
The hardest part
of being who or what l am

22:50.440 --> 22:55.440
is having the power to change the things
l wanna change, and knowing that l can't.

22:55.560 --> 22:58.800
Even when l'm certain,
even when it's absolutely clear to me,

22:58.880 --> 23:01.680
even when it affects
the people l care about.

23:02.680 --> 23:07.040
For all l can do, l'm no more qualified
to play God than the Goa'uld are.

23:10.760 --> 23:14.960
- Baal will keep this up.
- Yes, he will.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.840
- So we've a limited amount of time.
- Gotta be someplace?

23:17.960 --> 23:19.520
No.

23:23.400 --> 23:28.240
There must be a reason Kanan returned.
Was it for the woman you were talking to?

23:28.760 --> 23:31.600
She must have something
to do with all of this.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.520
You know, screw it. lt doesn't matter.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.240
Carter and Teal'c will think of something.

23:38.360 --> 23:43.480
- Even if they could find where you are...
- And Jonas, he's at least as smart as you.

23:43.560 --> 23:47.040
- There isn't always a way out.
- lf that was true, l'd be dead by now.

23:47.120 --> 23:51.040
How many more times can you go into
that sarcophagus before it changes you?

23:51.160 --> 23:53.840
How many times has it been already?

23:53.960 --> 23:56.960
lt can make you strong enough
to go through that again,

23:57.040 --> 24:00.000
but all the time
it's destroying who you are.

24:00.120 --> 24:04.000
Once that happens you won't be able to
ascend, no matter how much you want to.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.680
Hey

24:06.520 --> 24:10.000
- l appreciate what you're trying to do.
- l believe you can do it.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.280
- This is me we're talkin' about
- Yes, it is.

24:13.400 --> 24:17.760
Now, please, just try to open your mind.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.560
Oh, stop it, will you?

24:20.680 --> 24:24.880
Did the Asgard name a ship after you
because they thought it was a cool name?

24:24.960 --> 24:27.320
Don't play dumb. You're smarter than that.

24:27.440 --> 24:31.840
They saw our potential in you
cos of who you are and what you've done.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.360
Humanity's potential.
That's the same thing Oma saw in me.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.440
l am not you

24:37.560 --> 24:40.400
When has that ever stopped you
from doing anything?

24:40.520 --> 24:43.920
OK. Put yourself in my shoes
and me in yours.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.640
- You'd be here for me.
- Damn straight.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.960
l'd have got you out, blown up this rathole
and made sure the son of a bitch suffered.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.160
- They'd have stopped you.
- They'd have a fight on their hands.

24:54.240 --> 24:57.040
- Baal would be dead...
- You're a better man than that.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.120
That's where you're wrong

25:09.760 --> 25:16.000
Right now l can't imagine... doing
or being anything other than what l am.

25:17.640 --> 25:21.040
l see things, l understand things
in a way l never could have before.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.520
But l chose this.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.720
Even when Jacob was
trying to heal me, l chose this.

25:26.840 --> 25:30.160
But you, where you're at now,
you don't have any other choices.

25:30.280 --> 25:34.400
This is not your life we're
talking about, Jack. This is your soul.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.400
This is it. What l'm offering you
is your only way out.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.880
You're wrong about that, too.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.240
l have another choice.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.560
What are you talking about?

25:59.440 --> 26:01.040
No.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.040
Any minute they're gonna come
and Baal is gonna kill me again.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.840
- You can make it the last time.
- Don't ask me to do that.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.000
- You can put an end to it.
- l won't do it.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.920
I'd do it for you, and you know it.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.160
l don't wanna see this cell again, Daniel.

26:41.360 --> 26:46.800
l don't know about you, but l'm beginning
to get the feeling there is nothing here.

26:51.680 --> 26:54.040
Wait. Guys.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.480
- Look at this.
- What is it?

26:58.600 --> 27:02.560
Kanan worked undercover as a Goa'uld
in Baal's service. How long ago was it?

27:02.640 --> 27:07.560
Several months. Baal has kept the outpost
hidden from the other System Lords.

27:07.680 --> 27:11.920
The outpost was a secret test facility
for weapons technology.

27:12.040 --> 27:15.520
Over a period of several months
he mapped out the entire facility...

27:15.640 --> 27:20.880
That's what Kanan reported to the Tok'ra
Council. But something just struck me.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.360
He used Baal's lo'taur, his personal slave,
to access much of that information.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.000
The lo'taur gave him access
to Baal's chamber.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.760
- You think Kanan withheld information?
- No.

27:31.880 --> 27:36.160
But think about it. A lo'taur
is a Goa'uld's most trusted servant.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.200
Why would he so blithely
betray his master?

27:39.960 --> 27:42.080
Her master.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.880
The slave was a woman.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.280
Access to Baal's own chamber.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.960
Are you suggesting that Kanan
engaged in an affair with this slave

27:51.080 --> 27:53.840
in order to gain access
to her master's quarters?

27:53.920 --> 27:58.240
Something had to be going on between
them, or why would she take the risk?

27:58.360 --> 28:01.280
A Tok'ra would go to great lengths
to accomplish a mission.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.840
So maybe he was just using her.

28:03.920 --> 28:06.800
But who knows?
The Tok'ra are a passionate race.

28:06.880 --> 28:10.320
The Tok'ra accept sacrifice
as a function of war.

28:12.960 --> 28:16.000
l do not believe this slave
was sufficient motive for Kanan.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.440
Sufficient motive for Kanan.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.160
The decision to act came after blending
with the mind of Colonel O'Neill.

28:26.280 --> 28:30.080
At which point he would have been
confronted with every thought and belief

28:30.200 --> 28:34.720
that makes the colonel who he is, and
be forced to judge himself by that code.

28:34.800 --> 28:39.440
What Hammond referred to as ''the
difference between us and the Tok'ra''.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.760
We don't leave our people behind.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.280
ls it you?

28:53.120 --> 28:55.560
You shouldn't be here.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.840
You look so different.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.320
How can you be Kanan?

29:00.440 --> 29:02.560
l'm not.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.440
lf l leave with you, he will know.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.800
He used both of us.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.520
He did use both of us.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.800
How long were you host to this Kanan
before he made you come here?

29:18.880 --> 29:20.880
Days or merely hours?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.800
l don't remember.

29:22.880 --> 29:26.160
What did this Kanan share
about his previous mission here?

29:26.280 --> 29:27.680
Nothing.

29:27.800 --> 29:31.600
- What did he want with my slave?
- l don't know.

29:31.720 --> 29:35.040
- Why did he return?
- l don't know.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.440
l believe you.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.800
You're a victim of this Tok'ra just as l am.

29:50.880 --> 29:56.720
This Kanan took over your body, just as
l or any other Goa'uld would have done.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.800
He used you to come here.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.800
But to what purpose?

30:07.600 --> 30:10.160
l believe the answers
are there in your mind.

30:10.240 --> 30:15.160
Even if you are host for a matter of hours,
something of him will be left behind.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.160
An unfortunate inheritance for you,

30:21.760 --> 30:23.920
because l will find them...

30:26.640 --> 30:29.440
if l have to dig them out.

30:33.440 --> 30:38.320
You're telling me Kanan was compelled
to rescue a slave he met months ago?

30:38.440 --> 30:41.200
As a result of blending
with Colonel O'Neill, yes.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.960
Based on the arrogant notion
O'Neill would never have left her behind.

30:45.080 --> 30:48.480
Sir, l know from experience
how deeply the emotions can be shared

30:48.560 --> 30:52.080
- between a Tok'ra symbiote and its host.
- So do l, Major Carter.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.280
Still, your theory seems
to be based on just intuition.

30:55.400 --> 30:59.520
l won't argue with that,
but it's not without reasoning.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.960
- l know that's where Colonel O'Neill is.
- As do l.

31:03.080 --> 31:06.160
- We're all in agreement.
- lt makes no difference.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.920
lf indeed O'Neill is in Baal's hands,
he is far beyond our reach.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.840
- We have plans to the outpost.
- Then you know it is a fortress.

31:13.960 --> 31:18.720
- An army could not hope to penetrate it.
- Kanan obviously thought it was possible.

31:19.040 --> 31:23.920
- Sir, if we went in with maybe two teams.
- l'm sorry, but l agree with the councillor.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.160
l've gone over the intel on this outpost.

31:26.280 --> 31:30.480
A successful attack of any magnitude
is beyond our capabilities.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.840
Come in.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.520
- General Hammond.
- Teal'c. What is it?

33:06.520 --> 33:09.840
l have been meditating on
the possibility of rescuing O'Neill.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.960
l've been going over the plans
of the outpost again myself.

33:13.080 --> 33:18.880
l don't see how we have a chance against
this fortress, no matter how big the force.

33:18.960 --> 33:23.280
Agreed. l believe it would take the power
of a Goa'uld mothership to do so.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.080
Unfortunately we don't have one of those.

33:26.160 --> 33:30.160
Perhaps not, but there are
many System Lords that do.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.320
What was its name?

33:38.680 --> 33:41.360
- Kanan.
- There. You remember his name.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.440
What was his mission?

33:45.520 --> 33:48.880
- No mission.
- Was it to steal the slave from me?

33:50.000 --> 33:51.600
l don't know.

33:51.680 --> 33:54.880
Did Kanan believe
a slave could know my secrets?

33:57.400 --> 34:01.680
There's something else
you're hiding from me. l sense it.

34:01.760 --> 34:04.120
l feel it.

34:05.920 --> 34:10.400
- When are you gonna end this?
- When you tell me what l wish to know

34:14.159 --> 34:16.120
Daniel...

34:17.520 --> 34:21.639
The mind is beginning to fail.
lt's time for the sarcophagus.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.520
But as you regain the strength
to return here, consider this.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.120
lt will be far worse next time.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.560
Daniel.

34:40.120 --> 34:43.199
Thoran's threatening
to end diplomatic relations.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.000
- What did he say?
- Among other things l won't mention,

34:46.120 --> 34:49.880
that this is the reason they've been
reluctant to share intelligence.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.960
- So be it.
- That's more or less what l said.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.840
The Tok'ra need us right now
more than we need them.

34:55.920 --> 34:59.120
- Do we expect a response from Lord Yu?
- No, sir.

34:59.240 --> 35:04.560
We know he received the plans to Baal's
outpost but we don't know if he'll act on it.

35:04.680 --> 35:09.440
l believe he will. Baal has kept the outpost
a secret from the other System Lords.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.800
How will destroying the power
generators first help the colonel?

35:12.920 --> 35:16.680
lt will give O'Neill a fighting chance,
nothing more.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.920
- Daniel?
- l'm here.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.960
You were gone.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.160
l know. l'm sorry.
There was something l had to do, but...

35:40.280 --> 35:44.320
l'm back now. l promise
l'll stay with you till this is over.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.520
- lt'll never be over.
- Yes, it will.

35:53.640 --> 35:58.880
- Daniel, you have to end this.
- Jack, just hang in there a while longer.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.880
No.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.960
l can't go back in there.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.880
lf l go back, l swear to God...

36:12.160 --> 36:15.200
l'll give Baal what he wants. l'll tell him.

36:16.320 --> 36:17.880
What?

36:20.040 --> 36:22.240
That he loved her.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.760
Kanan?

36:25.880 --> 36:28.880
He came back for her.
He wanted to save her.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.640
- Baal doesn't know this.
- lf he finds out,

36:33.760 --> 36:36.120
he'll do to her what he's doing to me.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.120
Daniel, if you don't end this...

36:42.560 --> 36:44.720
l'll tell him.

36:44.840 --> 36:48.120
You won't have to. lt's almost over, Jack.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.720
- How?
- You were right.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.800
There was always a way out.

36:57.760 --> 37:00.160
Well, at least there was always a chance.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.240
Your journey isn't over, Jack. Not yet.

37:07.080 --> 37:11.280
- What'd you do?
- Nothing. lt was Sam and Teal'c.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.960
And Jonas, too.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.480
What?

37:17.920 --> 37:19.880
They thought of something.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.640
What?

37:25.400 --> 37:27.280
This is it.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.880
All you ever wanted was
a fighting chance, Jack. Now you have it.

37:30.960 --> 37:33.240
lf anyone can make it out of here,
you can.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.360
Lord Yu attacks.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.240
Daniel

38:24.720 --> 38:26.480
- Come with me.
- He'll stop us.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.360
Come

38:41.520 --> 38:45.520
Dr Fraiser says he'll suffer withdrawal
symptoms from so long in a sarcophagus,

38:45.640 --> 38:47.640
but she expects a full recovery.

38:47.720 --> 38:52.240
- What about the woman he returned for?
- She decided to stay with the Tok'ra.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.800
She will fight in Kanan's name.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.800
Hey.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.000
l'm tryin' to sleep here.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.120
Sorry, sir. Glad to see you're OK.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.720
Listen.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.160
A good idea you had there.

39:10.280 --> 39:13.800
Actually, sir, we all contributed to it.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.720
D'you need anything or...?

39:22.280 --> 39:24.480
- Water.
- Sure.

39:37.840 --> 39:41.040
l always seem to be
saying goodbye to you.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.760
Yeah, l noticed that.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.960
- Why don't you stick around for a while?
- l can't really.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.960
- You just did.
- Special occasion.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.800
- Christmas?
- No.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.120
- Groundhog Day?
- No.

39:57.200 --> 40:00.880
- l've got my journey, you've got yours?
- Something like that, yeah.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.040
Look, l know you don't think so...

40:08.040 --> 40:11.640
Right now, l mean,
l know you have your doubts, but...

40:11.720 --> 40:16.560
You've been through something
that no one should have to go through.

40:16.680 --> 40:21.200
l guess what l'm trying to say is,
you're gonna be all right.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.520
- How do you know?
- You're just gonna have to trust me.

40:27.240 --> 40:29.600
l can do that.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.640
- Are you gonna be OK?
- Yeah, l'm gonna be fine.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.800
Here you go, sir.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.840
Thanks.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.920
