01:37.963 --> 01:40.420
If you're not gonna return my calls.

01:40.508 --> 01:43.213
then there's no way
for us to communicate.

01:43.345 --> 01:47.177
Look. I don't know how to do this.

You're gonna need to come home now .

They want your job. This cannot happen

Thanks for the time

04:42.333 --> 04:45.785
That you've given me

04:45.879 --> 04:51.882
The memories are all in my mind

04:51.968 --> 04:54.756
And now that we've come

04:54.847 --> 04:58.430
To the end of our rainbow

04:58.517 --> 05:04.771
There's something l must say out loud

05:04.858 --> 05:08.690
Yes, you're once, twice

Three times a lady

05:49.573 --> 05:51.697
Largeman, what are you doing here?

05:51.784 --> 05:55.403
Uh... that's my mom.

05:55.497 --> 05:58.248
- Fuck.
- Aw, fuck.

05:59.584 --> 06:02.835
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

06:02.921 --> 06:06.337
So... welcome back home.

06:06.425 --> 06:08.169

06:08.260 --> 06:10.549
So, what have you been doin'?

06:10.638 --> 06:14.174

06:14.268 --> 06:16.177
- ln L.A., right?
- Yeah.

06:16.270 --> 06:19.140
That's cool.
l hear that place is, like, fucking crazy.

06:19.231 --> 06:22.932
My cousin's a writer out there.
He says that place is, like, mad crazy.

06:23.027 --> 06:26.028
He's, like, writing a movie
about snowboarders or some shit.

06:26.114 --> 06:29.032
l don't, l don't know. Um...

06:29.117 --> 06:32.949
l should introduce you to him, Largeman.
Maybe you could do something together.

06:33.037 --> 06:35.078
Yeah, definitely.

06:35.165 --> 06:38.250
What are you doing tonight, man?

06:38.336 --> 06:40.542
Uh... nothin', you know.

06:40.630 --> 06:43.833
You know, no real plans.
Just in town for a couple of days, so...

06:43.925 --> 06:48.386
You should come out with us. We're
gonna go over to the Gleasons' house.

06:48.472 --> 06:52.055
They're having some...
fucking huge party or something.

06:52.142 --> 06:55.060
- Supposedly.
- Well, yeah, supposedly.

06:55.145 --> 06:57.720
- Really?
- He lives up on the hill.

06:57.816 --> 07:00.022
We'll probably go over there
after we bury your mom.

07:00.109 --> 07:04.238
- Well, l got to shower.
- Same.

07:04.322 --> 07:08.736
Do you know your mother
redid the hallway bathroom?

07:08.828 --> 07:10.821
What? l'm sorry, what?

07:10.913 --> 07:13.997
Since l met her, she never
showed an interest in anything.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.159
All of a sudden,
a month ago, she wakes up,

07:16.252 --> 07:18.957
she wants to redecorate her bathroom.

07:19.046 --> 07:21.254
l helped her.

07:21.341 --> 07:25.090
- Oh, must have been fun.
- Well, l sew.

07:25.179 --> 07:29.721
l made you something.
lt's a shirt.

07:29.808 --> 07:34.056
That's-That's good.
Thank you.

07:34.147 --> 07:36.270
Will you try it on now?

07:38.860 --> 07:41.530
- Now?
- Well, in case l have to fix it

07:41.613 --> 07:45.196
before you leave again, and we
don't see you for another nine years.

07:45.284 --> 07:47.324
l want to make sure it fits.

07:47.411 --> 07:50.116
Oh, OK.

07:50.206 --> 07:53.077
You're gonna love the material.

07:53.167 --> 07:57.379
l used the leftovers
from your mother's design. Gorgeous.

08:14.732 --> 08:15.847
Hi.

08:18.404 --> 08:19.898
Hello.

08:19.989 --> 08:22.315
How you doin'?

08:22.408 --> 08:25.325
''Well, besides that, Mrs. Lincoln,
how was the show?''

08:25.411 --> 08:29.030
You know, l'm not really sure
what to say here, Dad, so l'm sorry.

08:29.124 --> 08:31.532
Hmm.

08:31.627 --> 08:35.494
How are you?

08:35.589 --> 08:40.548
l'm OK. l've been getting these
really bad headaches, though.

08:40.637 --> 08:43.342
Um... they're really quick.

08:43.431 --> 08:46.883
lt's like a, like just a little
lightening storm in my head.

08:46.977 --> 08:49.894
Just for a second, and then it's gone.

08:49.980 --> 08:53.065
l just thought maybe you could help me
get that checked out while l'm home.

08:53.150 --> 08:55.190
Go see Dr. Cohen
first thing in the morning.

08:55.277 --> 08:57.851
He's a neurologist in my building.
l-l'll call him.

08:57.947 --> 09:00.782
He'll fit you in.
l'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

09:05.957 --> 09:08.992
- Place looks good.
- Oh, that's nice.

09:09.084 --> 09:11.041
Yeah, we've been doing
a lot of work on it.

09:11.128 --> 09:13.205
Really?

09:15.675 --> 09:18.961
Actually, no.
l don't know why l just said that.

09:19.054 --> 09:21.544
Someone redid the hallway bathroom.
l saw that.

09:21.639 --> 09:24.891
Yeah, that's new.

09:28.856 --> 09:30.730
l'm glad you're here.

09:33.236 --> 09:36.154
Saying goodbye is important.

09:38.909 --> 09:42.610
l'm glad you could fit it in.

10:12.196 --> 10:17.736
I think I'll go home and mull this over

10:17.827 --> 10:22.454
Before I cram it down my throat

10:22.540 --> 10:25.032
At long last it's crashed

10:25.127 --> 10:27.534
Its colossal mass

10:27.629 --> 10:32.457
Has broken up into bits in my moat

10:34.136 --> 10:37.007
Lift the mattress off the floor

10:39.475 --> 10:44.305
Walk the cramps off.
go meander in the cold

10:44.398 --> 10:46.971
Hail to your dark skin

10:47.067 --> 10:49.475
Hiding the fact you're dead again

10:49.570 --> 10:55.110
Underneath the power lines
seeking shade...

10:55.202 --> 10:57.491
- Put your hands on your head, please!
- What?

10:57.579 --> 11:02.656
l said, put your motherfucking hands
on you head... please.

11:02.751 --> 11:07.248
82 in a 25. What are you gonna tell me,
you're late or you're just tired?

11:07.340 --> 11:09.131
- l was--
- Shut the fuck up!

11:14.973 --> 11:17.095
- Largeman!
- Kenny?

11:17.183 --> 11:19.509
Holy shit!

11:19.603 --> 11:21.228
Oh, man! How you doin?

11:21.313 --> 11:23.271
l'm... l'm great!

11:23.357 --> 11:25.765
- You're mom just died!
- l know!

11:25.860 --> 11:29.692
- l mean, that's why you're home.
- Yeah, yep.

11:29.781 --> 11:33.826
- You're a cop, Kenny?
- Yeah. l know, l know.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.654
Why?

11:35.746 --> 11:38.201
l don't know.
Couldn't think of anything better to do.

11:38.290 --> 11:41.376
No, but it's really cool, though, man.
People really listen to you.

11:41.461 --> 11:44.247
l mean... they have to!

11:44.338 --> 11:46.580
Yo, and check this shit out.
That's the safety.

11:46.674 --> 11:49.000
- Oh, cool.
- And plus, the benefits, man.

11:49.093 --> 11:52.131
lf l get shot, l'm like, mmm! Rich!

11:52.223 --> 11:55.806
But Kenny, the last time l saw you,
you were doing coke lines off a urinal.

11:55.893 --> 11:57.222
La-la-la-la

11:57.312 --> 11:59.303
No, l had to grow up, man.
lt's time to grow up.

11:59.396 --> 12:01.685
Plus, l wasn't making shit
in that fish market.

12:01.774 --> 12:04.231
No, no one knew who l was.
Couldn't get laid.

12:04.319 --> 12:07.735
lt's a much better situation for me, man.

12:07.823 --> 12:11.239
Speaking of which, um...

12:11.327 --> 12:14.031
- ...how'd l do?
- What do you mean?

12:14.120 --> 12:16.280
l don't know.
You know, just the whole...

12:16.374 --> 12:18.616
You mean, like... as a cop?

12:18.710 --> 12:21.201
Yeah, the whole, ''Shut the fuck up!''

12:21.296 --> 12:24.546
Well, l thought you were a dick,
so l guess that's good.

12:24.633 --> 12:27.800
Nice!
So, what the fuck, man?

12:27.886 --> 12:30.757
You're this huge movie star now?
l heard you did some...

12:30.848 --> 12:33.006
You played a big football player?
l didn't see it.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.429
Oh, yeah, just this thing.

12:34.519 --> 12:37.306
- Fucking De Niro and shit!
- What?

12:37.398 --> 12:38.940
- He's awesome.
- Yeah.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.063
- Deer Hunter ?
- Yeah.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.938
Man... we should sit down.
We should talk,

12:44.029 --> 12:48.656
because l've got some really good ideas
for movies. You could play me and shit!

12:48.743 --> 12:52.029
Stories From the Force.

12:52.122 --> 12:54.363
Yeah, definitely.
That sounds good.

13:17.733 --> 13:19.809
- Holy shit!
- Hi, what's up?

13:19.902 --> 13:22.310
- How you doin', man?
- Good. How you doin', man?

13:22.405 --> 13:24.978
- How you doin?
- Get this guy a beer. Give him your beer.

13:25.074 --> 13:27.910
This guy does not wait for a beer.
He's a movie star!

13:27.994 --> 13:30.402
He's like, Jersey's De Niro and shit.

13:31.790 --> 13:33.747
Largeman, man,
what are you doing home?

13:35.086 --> 13:37.208
- l, uh...
- Press junket.

13:38.547 --> 13:41.038
Oh, that's phat, yo!
Fuck, yeah!

13:41.133 --> 13:44.549
Serpico and shit! ''Attica!''

13:44.637 --> 13:46.465
Shut the fuck up, man.

13:49.101 --> 13:51.591
You like that?

13:51.686 --> 13:54.391
Like ''press junket''?

13:54.481 --> 13:56.854
That's improv, bitch.
You can use it.

13:56.943 --> 13:59.481
All right? OK.
Let me show you something.

14:05.119 --> 14:07.157
Largeman! Whoa, whoa.

14:07.245 --> 14:09.488
What's goin' on, man?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.658
How you been, man? Hey!

14:11.751 --> 14:14.040
- Jess, how are you, bro?
- Whoa! How's it goin', man?

14:14.128 --> 14:17.414
What's goin' on, man? l haven't seen you
in so long. l heard you're kickin' ass.

14:17.507 --> 14:21.007
Oh, basically the man
bought my silent Velcro patent.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.550
- What?
- l developed this little item.

14:23.639 --> 14:28.764
lt's just like Velcro, but it doesn't
make that... the Velcro noise.

14:28.853 --> 14:31.641
- So, how much did they buy it for?
- A lot, man!

14:31.732 --> 14:34.648
Wow. So, what are you
doing with yourself?

14:34.734 --> 14:36.691
Um, yeah, nothing. Nothing.

14:36.778 --> 14:38.771
l've never been so bored in my whole life.

14:38.863 --> 14:42.030
First month, l went out, you know.
l bought a whole bunch of shit.

14:42.117 --> 14:43.945
But, you know-- Nothing.

14:46.122 --> 14:48.659
Someone got a joint for me?

15:17.740 --> 15:20.611
Mmm.

15:20.701 --> 15:23.157
Here you go.

15:23.246 --> 15:25.618
Ugh. No thanks, man.

15:25.707 --> 15:29.124
Really? l thought you're
a big movie star and shit.

15:29.211 --> 15:32.081
- Nah.
- Well, then, here.

15:32.172 --> 15:34.663
Eat this.

15:34.758 --> 15:36.965
Welcome home.

15:48.189 --> 15:50.479
Guess l'll see you guys later.

15:53.404 --> 15:55.231
Should we play a game?

15:55.323 --> 15:58.324
Let's play ''Spin the Bottle.''

15:58.410 --> 16:01.529
l'm not playing ''Spin the Bottle.''
How old are we?

16:01.621 --> 16:03.614
More importantly, how old are they?

16:03.707 --> 16:06.874
Oh, they're all legal... l think.

16:06.961 --> 16:09.333
Well, we just ate all this fuckin' X,

16:09.422 --> 16:12.127

16:12.216 --> 16:14.209
Girl has a point.

Fuckin' right.

Ticking clock

16:37.620 --> 16:40.158
Everyone stop

16:40.248 --> 16:43.201
Everyone's saying
different things to me

16:43.292 --> 16:45.498
Different things to me

16:48.298 --> 16:52.628
Do you believe in what you see?

16:54.138 --> 16:59.133
There doesn't seem to be anybody else
who agrees with me

16:59.227 --> 17:04.767
Do you believe in what you see?

17:04.858 --> 17:07.894
Motionless wheel

17:07.986 --> 17:10.940
Nothing is real

17:11.031 --> 17:15.777
Do you believe in what you see?

17:18.080 --> 17:23.456
And I'll hide away for another day

17:23.545 --> 17:25.502
Large!

17:28.341 --> 17:30.418
Large!

17:35.350 --> 17:37.972
Largeman, this is Dana.

17:38.061 --> 17:42.390
- Hi.
- Hi. Who's up?

18:20.775 --> 18:22.233
This is gonna be a good night.

18:22.317 --> 18:27.774
Do you believe in what you see?

18:27.865 --> 18:30.737
Everyone's saying
different things to me

18:30.828 --> 18:33.829
Different things to me

18:33.914 --> 18:37.164
Everyone's saying
different things to me

18:37.250 --> 18:39.788
Different things to me

18:39.878 --> 18:42.880
Everyone's saying
different things to me

18:42.966 --> 18:45.883
Different things to me

18:45.969 --> 18:49.006
Everyone's saying
different things to me

18:49.097 --> 18:51.173
Different things to me

19:39.903 --> 19:41.861
lt's good, isn't it?

19:45.701 --> 19:48.952
l always try to save a couple of
the marshmallows till the very end,

19:49.038 --> 19:50.912
but l never make it.

19:50.999 --> 19:55.578
l always end up with...
bunch of flake things and pink milk.

19:56.838 --> 19:58.961
My mind wanders.

20:02.303 --> 20:04.972
So, Tim...

20:05.056 --> 20:07.428
...how long have you been
working at Medieval Times?

20:07.517 --> 20:11.135
Three years, but l've only
been a knight for two.

20:11.229 --> 20:13.223
You have to pay your dues.

20:13.315 --> 20:16.434
l worked in the stables
and helped in the kitchen.

20:16.526 --> 20:18.982
When l started,
he was making the coleslaw.

20:19.071 --> 20:20.945
Hasn't been the same
since you got knighted.

20:21.031 --> 20:23.191
l really just stirred it.

20:23.285 --> 20:25.277
Don't be modest!

20:25.370 --> 20:27.826
Mr. Modesty won the joust last night.

20:27.915 --> 20:31.330
- Congratulations.
- lt's not that big a deal. lt's fixed.

20:32.961 --> 20:35.287
What was it that happened
to you in high school?

20:35.381 --> 20:37.290
You had a thing.
l forgot what it was.

20:37.383 --> 20:39.756
- He got the shit kicked out of him.
- No, he didn't.

20:39.844 --> 20:43.509
How do you know? He got the shit
kicked out of him by Tyrell Freeman.

20:43.597 --> 20:46.386
- l fucked him up, too.
- He knocked your teeth out.

20:46.476 --> 20:48.718
He only chipped one tooth.

20:51.106 --> 20:55.567
So, what are you up to now, Mark?
You're digging graves?

21:00.074 --> 21:02.151
Mark's gettin' into real estate.

21:07.249 --> 21:09.919
- Tim can speak Klingon.
- What?

21:10.003 --> 21:11.911
- No, l can't .
-Yes, you can.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.210
- What the fuck is Klingon?
- Like the Star Trek guys?

21:14.298 --> 21:16.754
- Yeah, he can speak their language!
- No, she's kidding.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.250
No, l'm not.
Why are you being shy?

21:19.345 --> 21:22.098
- Yeah, don't be shy, Tim.
- lt's just, it's made up.

21:22.183 --> 21:24.756
This guy who plays the wizard
at work is a Trekkie. l don't--

21:24.852 --> 21:27.177
Don't be shy.
Tell them what you said to me last night.

21:27.270 --> 21:30.936
- No.
- Say what you said to her last night.

21:32.444 --> 21:36.109
Kuntar petiki maya.
Al fuks su.

21:36.198 --> 21:38.523
You got to be kidding me.

21:38.617 --> 21:40.941
lt means, ''l like to mate after battle.''

21:41.035 --> 21:43.029
- That's not what l said!
- Yes.

21:43.122 --> 21:46.906
No, no. That wasn't the one l said.
This one means, ''Kill Kirk.''

21:47.001 --> 21:50.869
And also, ''Hallelujah,''
depending on the context.

21:50.964 --> 21:53.289
You must have gotten it confused with...

21:53.383 --> 21:55.874
...plejit amor eke frek ize ka.

21:55.969 --> 21:58.092
Ah! That is good!

21:58.180 --> 22:00.718
You know what that means, Tim?
Well, l do.

22:00.808 --> 22:04.640
lt means, ''Get the fuck out of my house
before l chop your fucking head off.''

22:12.612 --> 22:15.020
Mark, he's a knight.

22:15.115 --> 22:17.903
He's just a fast-food knight.

22:20.163 --> 22:22.155
l should get going.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.844
Thanks for the cereal.

22:35.930 --> 22:38.883
l had a lovely evening.

22:38.974 --> 22:41.513
By the way, it says ''balls'' on your face.

22:43.814 --> 22:46.601
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.356
In the spring.
the hungry gator must find new ...

22:53.991 --> 22:58.321
...and clever ways to find food.

23:01.374 --> 23:04.412
Did you tell Large about the tapes?

23:04.504 --> 23:07.208
No, Mom.
l'm not doing those stupid tapes.

23:07.297 --> 23:09.290
- What are the tapes?
- Real estate tapes.

23:09.383 --> 23:12.717
You could make up to
$1 00,000 your first year.

23:12.803 --> 23:15.722
You should have seen
the boat this Oriental guy had.

23:15.808 --> 23:18.477
And he even had his own game show
in China, he had so much money.

23:18.561 --> 23:20.636
l think Mark would be perfect at it.

23:20.729 --> 23:24.429
Ma, shut up about those fuckin' tapes,
OK? lt's a scam.

23:24.524 --> 23:28.191
Well, l'm doin' it.
l'm savin' up for those tapes.

23:28.279 --> 23:31.150
Because l know what you could be
if you just apply yourself.

23:31.241 --> 23:34.194
l do apply myself every day, Mom.

23:34.285 --> 23:37.453
l work my ass off
burying dead people, OK?

23:37.539 --> 23:40.457
l'm only 26. l'm not in any rush.
What's your rush for?

23:42.295 --> 23:46.127
Just let me be.
l don't rush you.

23:47.383 --> 23:50.171
OK, then l'll do 'em myself.

23:50.261 --> 23:53.049
Fine, do 'em.

23:53.140 --> 23:57.007
OK, then l won't let you on my yacht.

23:57.102 --> 24:00.354
Except Large.
Large, you can come anytime you want.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.479
Just don't bring your friend here.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.020
Oh, shit.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.106
Shit, l got to go to my meeting.

24:10.785 --> 24:12.777
OK.

24:14.288 --> 24:17.205
l love you.

24:17.291 --> 24:19.912
- l love you, too.
- l love you.

24:22.589 --> 24:26.124
- Large, it was nice to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

24:26.218 --> 24:28.923
Oh, oh, you guys.
Don't stay in here all day.

24:29.013 --> 24:31.717
l took the batteries out of
the carbon monoxide detector.

24:31.806 --> 24:34.346
lt was beeping all night.

24:37.188 --> 24:39.347
She drives me crazy!

24:39.441 --> 24:42.727
She gets all baked out and makes
me feel like l have to impress her.

24:42.819 --> 24:47.482
And you know what? l'm OK with
being unimpressive. l sleep better.

24:48.909 --> 24:51.910
- Hey, what time is it?
- No idea.

24:51.996 --> 24:53.989
Oh, my-- l got to go.

24:59.295 --> 25:02.961
Hi. l'm Andrew Largeman. l'm sorry,
l'm really late for my appointment.

25:03.050 --> 25:05.837
Andrew, Andrew...
OK, Andrew.

25:05.928 --> 25:08.930
l'm gonna need you to fill out
this paperwork for me, OK?

25:09.015 --> 25:11.803
- As soon as we're ready, we'll call you.
- Thank you. l'm sorry.

25:11.893 --> 25:14.562
lt's OK. Have a seat.
Hello, Miss Lubin.

25:14.645 --> 25:17.682
- Oh, hello there.
- Have a seat. We'll be with you soon.

25:17.774 --> 25:20.064
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:43.886 --> 25:45.844
How's it goin'?

25:48.516 --> 25:51.683
Get off! Get off!

26:00.821 --> 26:02.150
Heel.

26:04.618 --> 26:06.611
Heel!

26:12.167 --> 26:15.751
- Got any suggestions?
- What?

26:15.839 --> 26:19.006
- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.

26:20.594 --> 26:22.587
Kick his balls.

26:24.138 --> 26:28.220
Yeah, but l don't want to, like, destroy
future generations of charitable dogs.

26:28.310 --> 26:30.268
Don't worry.
l got three Dobermans.

26:30.354 --> 26:33.771
lf l don't kick them in the balls regularly,
l'd never get anything done.

26:33.858 --> 26:35.815
But he's got to be close
to finishing by now.

26:35.902 --> 26:39.686
Not yet. Here comes the lipstick.

26:39.781 --> 26:41.062
- Mrs. Lubin?
- Yes?

26:41.158 --> 26:44.444
- We're ready for you now.
- OK. Come on, Arthur.

26:51.628 --> 26:54.165
l feel so used.

26:54.255 --> 26:59.463
Thanks for your help,
or, at least, your good intentions.

26:59.553 --> 27:02.508
- l recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

27:02.599 --> 27:04.757
No, not from high school. From TV.

27:04.851 --> 27:06.890
Didn't you play the retarded quarterback?

27:06.977 --> 27:09.848
- Yeah.
- Are you really retarded?

27:11.817 --> 27:15.233
- No, l'm not.
- Cool.

27:15.321 --> 27:18.939
Great job, man. l mean,
l thought you were really retarded.

27:19.033 --> 27:22.235
You're just as good as that Corky kid,
and he's actually retarded.

27:22.327 --> 27:28.284
lf there's some sort of retarded Oscar,
you would win hands down, kick his ass.

27:28.376 --> 27:31.046
Well, thank you.
Thanks, l appreciate it.

27:31.129 --> 27:33.621
l have to fill out this form, though, so...

27:33.716 --> 27:35.708
- Right on.
- Thanks.

27:40.181 --> 27:44.013
My cousin's an actor. Jake Ryan
Winters? Doubt you've ever heard of him.

27:44.102 --> 27:48.017
He was, like, on X ena once,
as a gnome or something.

27:48.107 --> 27:52.021
- That's really cool, though.
- Thanks.

27:53.362 --> 27:55.319
Oh, my God!

27:55.406 --> 27:59.784
That scene, that last scene where you
give the speech to the whole stadium.

27:59.870 --> 28:03.570
And your dad-- Oh!
And your dad gives you the thumbs-up!

28:03.665 --> 28:09.040
That was, like... that was emotional.

28:09.130 --> 28:11.087
So, you got anything else coming out?

28:11.174 --> 28:13.416
No, you know.
l'm just, l'm auditioning--

28:13.510 --> 28:16.843
l can't believe you're not really retarded!
Jake's not a very good actor.

28:16.930 --> 28:20.679
You can't really tell on X ena, 'cause he's
in the hairy gnome suit and everything,

28:20.767 --> 28:24.635
but when we were little, he used to
put on these really low-budg renditions

28:24.730 --> 28:29.725
of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals
in our attic, and they were awful!

28:29.819 --> 28:32.903
Like, so bad. Aah!

28:33.907 --> 28:37.572
lt sucks, though, 'cause there's not that
much work for little people, you know.

28:37.661 --> 28:40.116
Anyway, l've been talking too much.

28:40.205 --> 28:42.958
l'll just--
You got to fill out your forms.

28:43.043 --> 28:46.043
What are you listening to?

28:46.128 --> 28:49.711
- The Shins. You know 'em?
- No.

28:49.799 --> 28:53.168
You got to hear this one song.
lt'll change your life, l swear.

28:53.261 --> 28:57.011
Oh, l'm sorry. You have to--
You got to fill out your forms.

28:57.099 --> 29:00.633
Conundrum!
Think you could maybe listen while--

29:00.727 --> 29:03.349
- l think l can handle it.
- Yeah? OK.

29:16.996 --> 29:21.208
Gold teeth and a curse for this town

29:21.292 --> 29:23.748
Were all in my mouth

29:23.837 --> 29:28.629
Only. I don't know how
they got out. dear

29:28.717 --> 29:31.089
Turn me back into the pet...

29:31.178 --> 29:32.672
lt's good. l like it.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.890
- So, what are you here for?
- What are you here for?

29:37.977 --> 29:40.184
Waiting for a friend. You?

29:42.232 --> 29:44.805
- l, uh--
- Oh, fuck, that was nosy. l'm sorry.

29:44.901 --> 29:46.894
Ugh. l am, l am so nosy.

29:46.987 --> 29:49.656
l didn't, l didn't mean to be-- l'm sorry.

29:49.740 --> 29:52.944
No, just, l get these headaches.
l just want to have it checked out.

29:53.036 --> 29:55.194
Cool.

29:55.288 --> 29:57.031
- Andrew Largeman?
- Yes?

29:57.123 --> 30:00.326
- We're ready for you now.
- Oh, OK.

30:00.418 --> 30:03.503
- Thank you. Nice meeting you.
- You didn't. l'm Sam.

30:03.589 --> 30:07.457
- Andrew.
- Nice to meet you.

30:07.552 --> 30:10.387
- Good luck with your head.
- Thanks.

30:12.097 --> 30:14.589
Don't worry, Sam.
We'll be with you next.

30:43.883 --> 30:46.588
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.

30:46.677 --> 30:48.801
- There's nothing wrong with you.
- What?

30:48.889 --> 30:50.846
Just kidding.
How would l know that?

30:50.933 --> 30:53.340
Uh...

30:53.435 --> 30:55.973
l'm Dr. Cohen.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.313
What can we do for you today, Andrew?

31:01.403 --> 31:03.941
l've been getting these
really intense headaches.

31:04.030 --> 31:07.281
Um, they last for, like, a split second.

31:07.366 --> 31:11.662
lt's like lightening. lt's like a surge
of electricity, and then it's gone.

31:14.917 --> 31:17.076
Lithium?

31:17.170 --> 31:19.162
How long have you been on the lithium?

31:19.255 --> 31:23.799
Um, l've been on some form of it
since l was ten or so.

31:25.929 --> 31:30.675
And the Paxil, Zoloft,
Celexa... Depakote?

31:30.768 --> 31:33.474
Did they help you at all?

31:33.563 --> 31:35.603
No.

31:36.983 --> 31:38.691
l mean, l don't know.

31:38.776 --> 31:41.861
lt's recently occurred to me
l might not even have a problem.

31:41.946 --> 31:44.949
Only, l'd never know it,
because as far back as l can remember,

31:45.034 --> 31:48.735
l've been medicated.
l left them in L.A., though.

31:48.830 --> 31:53.575
This is the first time l haven't had
medicine in my body for a long time.

31:53.667 --> 31:57.251
Well, that stuff will leave your body pretty
fast. l could write you a prescription.

31:57.339 --> 31:59.747
Actually, l was thinking
about taking a vacation.

31:59.842 --> 32:02.131
Have you discussed this
with your psychiatrist?

32:02.219 --> 32:06.596
Uh... well, my psychiatrist is my dad.

32:07.725 --> 32:10.929
Yeah, so l think
he'd prefer me to stay on it.

32:11.020 --> 32:14.354
He... likes to think it makes me happy.

32:15.984 --> 32:19.519
You know, our bodies are capable
of doing some very funny things

32:19.613 --> 32:22.733
when they're consumed
with stress and anxiety.

32:22.825 --> 32:24.782
Uh...

32:24.869 --> 32:29.746
l found my ex-best friend's
cufflinks in my wife's purse.

32:30.626 --> 32:32.534
Hmm.

32:32.627 --> 32:37.040
l couldn't get an erection
for year and a half... for example.

32:39.218 --> 32:42.006
Wow. Um...

32:42.097 --> 32:45.098
But, l don't really think that's it,
because l don't,

32:45.183 --> 32:48.516
l don't really feel, like,
stressed or anxious at all.

32:48.603 --> 32:52.436
Well, with all the lithium he's had you on,
it's amazing you can even hear me now.

32:54.527 --> 32:56.733
Look, Andrew, first of all,

32:56.821 --> 33:00.273
l think you do need to find a psychiatrist
that isn't your father.

33:00.367 --> 33:05.159
That's something that should have been
remedied years ago. He knows better!

33:05.247 --> 33:08.865
And secondly... l'm in no position
to comment on whether

33:08.959 --> 33:12.079
you should stay on the meds or not,
'cause l don't know your story.

33:12.171 --> 33:16.169
But my opinion , since you're paying for it,

33:16.259 --> 33:19.877
is that yeah, those drugs may help you
as a means to an end.

33:19.971 --> 33:22.178
But sooner or later,
if you're not in therapy,

33:22.265 --> 33:27.012
whatever's going on in your mind will find
a way to peek its head out of the water.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.262
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:29.356 --> 33:32.441
Yeah, you're all right.
You're alive.

33:32.526 --> 33:35.196
Come on.
l'll take a look at you. Come.

33:36.823 --> 33:40.275
l'll need you to take your shoes off.
l have to scratch your feet.

33:40.369 --> 33:43.737
Godspeed all the bakers at dawn

33:44.748 --> 33:47.321
May they all cut their thumbs

33:47.417 --> 33:51.084
And bleed into their buns
till they melt away

33:53.258 --> 33:57.386
I'm looking in on the good life

33:57.471 --> 34:00.840
I might be doomed never to find

34:00.933 --> 34:05.642
And if you'd 'a took to me. like

34:05.730 --> 34:08.684
I'd 'a danced like
the queen of the eyesores

34:08.775 --> 34:11.348
And the rest of our lives
would 'a fared well

34:13.363 --> 34:15.486
So, why were you really there?

34:15.574 --> 34:19.073
Charging. l'm a robot.

34:19.161 --> 34:22.613
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?

34:22.707 --> 34:24.700
Enough for people to call you a liar.

34:24.793 --> 34:28.541
- People call me lots of things.
- ls one of them ''liar''?

34:28.630 --> 34:31.500
l could say no,
but how would you know l'm not lying?

34:31.591 --> 34:34.129
l guess l could choose to trust you.

34:34.219 --> 34:36.711
- You can do that?
- l can try.

34:37.891 --> 34:40.926
Whose bike is that?

34:41.018 --> 34:43.592
lt was my grandfather's.

34:43.688 --> 34:47.639
lt was the only thing he left to anyone
in my family, and he left it to me.

34:47.735 --> 34:49.727
And l like it.

34:53.491 --> 34:57.025
So, this is the point in the conversation
where you ask me if l'd like a ride home.

34:57.119 --> 34:59.362
- lt is?
- Yep.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.915
Would you like a ride home?

35:06.004 --> 35:09.623
Fine... but l'm not getting in that sidecar.

35:09.717 --> 35:12.338
- Why not?
- Sidecars are for bitches.

35:12.428 --> 35:15.263
Anyone who rides in that
is automatically your bitch.

35:15.348 --> 35:17.388
Thus, l better ride on the back.

35:26.193 --> 35:28.186
- Oh.
- Hold on tight.

35:28.279 --> 35:30.271
OK, holdin'!

35:33.702 --> 35:36.193
My hair's blowin' in the wind.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.792
What, are you, like, a hand glider?

35:42.879 --> 35:46.711
My boyfriend was gonna pick me up,
so l brought it, but then he couldn't.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.042
What does he have,
one of those tandem things?

35:49.135 --> 35:52.052
No, he drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.

35:52.138 --> 35:55.389
- What kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.

35:55.476 --> 35:57.801
- How's your head?
- l should live through the day.

35:57.895 --> 36:00.018
- Cool. Make a right here.
- All right.

36:05.695 --> 36:09.444
- Are you doing anything right now?
- Can you elaborate on ''doing anything''?

36:09.532 --> 36:12.902
lt's just, l know this guy, Jesse.
He bought this mansion right up here.

36:12.995 --> 36:16.530
And he wants me to come visit him,
but l don't want to stay very long.

36:16.623 --> 36:19.246
So, l was thinking, like, if you came, too,

36:19.336 --> 36:21.956
l could just say l have to take you home
when l'm ready to go.

36:22.046 --> 36:26.044
Wow. That's pretty damn
random of you, Andrew.

36:26.134 --> 36:28.626
- Well...
- ''Nice to meet you. Can l use you?''

36:28.721 --> 36:31.675
- lt's the Hollywood in you.
- No. Come on, it's not like that.

36:31.766 --> 36:36.344
lt'll be fun, come on. l'll tell you what.
We can have, like, a signal.

36:36.437 --> 36:39.522
Like, when you pull on your ear,
that's the code.

36:39.608 --> 36:41.684
And l'll be like,
''Oh, l got to take her home.''

36:41.777 --> 36:45.063
And then, then we'll go.

36:45.155 --> 36:47.232
Can we have code names, too?

36:47.324 --> 36:49.993
lf you want.

36:50.076 --> 36:53.162
OK... but don't try and, like,
kidnap me or anything,

36:53.247 --> 36:57.198
'cause my step uncle's a bounty hunter,
and he could have you tracked and killed.

36:57.293 --> 36:59.333
You're such a liar.

37:01.882 --> 37:03.875
Whoo!

37:05.177 --> 37:07.549
OK, you ready?

37:28.453 --> 37:31.537
l'll be fine. Am l the first boy
you've ever brought home?

37:31.622 --> 37:36.665
No, but, um... l lied to you before when l
told you that my boyfriend drives a Ninja.

37:36.754 --> 37:40.918
- He doesn't drive a bike?
- No, l don't have a boyfriend.

37:41.008 --> 37:45.052
But, you know, he might drive a Ninja...
wherever he is.

37:45.137 --> 37:47.094
Wow, we're off to a great start.

37:47.181 --> 37:51.476
OK. So-So sometimes l lie.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.100
l mean, l'm weird, man.

37:54.189 --> 37:57.523
About random stuff, too.
l don't even know why l do it.

37:57.610 --> 38:01.608
lt's like, it's like a tic. l mean, sometimes
l hear myself say something,

38:01.697 --> 38:06.407
and then l think,
''Wow, that wasn't even remotely true.''

38:06.494 --> 38:09.068
So, how do people know what's real?

38:09.164 --> 38:14.751
Well, l always feel bad afterwards
and admit them when they're lies.

38:14.837 --> 38:19.546
- Can you trust that?
- Open the door.

38:27.767 --> 38:29.926
Kevin, down. Mom!

38:30.020 --> 38:34.268
Come on, kick 'em in the balls.
Come on. Mom!

38:35.318 --> 38:38.189
Everybody down.
Who wants to eat?

38:38.280 --> 38:40.522
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.

38:40.616 --> 38:42.572
Go on, get out.

38:44.828 --> 38:47.616
l'm so sorry.
We just don't have the time to train them.

38:47.707 --> 38:49.996
- Who's got the time to train them?
- Mom.

38:50.084 --> 38:53.204
- This is Andrew.
- Welcome, welcome.

38:53.296 --> 38:55.787
- l'm sorry the place is a wreck. Honey?
- Mm-hmm?

38:55.882 --> 38:58.504
l asked you to get the metal wheel
out of the hamster cage?

38:58.593 --> 39:01.263
- l forgot.
- Well, you forgot, and now Jelly's dead.

39:01.346 --> 39:03.635
Luckily, l got Peanut Butter out in time.

39:03.724 --> 39:05.717
We have to get the only hamsters
on planet Earth

39:05.809 --> 39:08.302
who can't figure out
a stupid hamster wheel.

39:08.397 --> 39:10.519
There's a tin box on the kitchen counter.

39:10.606 --> 39:13.098
You can do the honors.
l have to get to work.

39:13.192 --> 39:16.858
- lt's nice to meet you. Andrew, right?
- Yes. Very nice to meet you.

39:16.947 --> 39:19.984
Samantha, put the clothes
in the dryer and bury Jelly.

39:25.456 --> 39:27.495
So, this is it.

39:35.009 --> 39:37.582
- lt's nice.
- No, it's not.

39:37.678 --> 39:40.050
Don't say that 'cause
you can't think of anything else.

39:40.138 --> 39:45.015
l'm not, l'm not. lt's very cozy. You guys
are a little early on the tree, though.

39:45.103 --> 39:47.641
Yeah, well, we never got around
to taking it down,

39:47.731 --> 39:50.815
so when it got to be fall again,
we figured, just leave it up.

39:50.901 --> 39:54.317
Oh, my God.
You're totally freaked out right now.

39:54.405 --> 39:59.067
- You, like, can't wait to leave.
- l'm not, l'm not. l like it. lt's very nice.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.995
- You want to see my room?
- Sure.

40:04.625 --> 40:08.574
Hey. Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.

40:08.670 --> 40:12.170
- Hi, it's very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.

40:12.257 --> 40:14.250
- l'm sorry about Jelly.
- Oh, that's OK.

40:14.343 --> 40:16.800
l saved some mac and cheese for you.
lt's in the fridge.

40:16.888 --> 40:19.344
Thank you.

40:23.102 --> 40:25.676
Anyway... l'm late for class.

40:25.772 --> 40:28.145
- lt's nice meeting you.
- Very nice to meet you.

40:28.234 --> 40:31.069
See you later.

40:33.990 --> 40:37.405
So, here we are.
lt's nothing fancy, but you know...

40:37.493 --> 40:39.866
What?

40:39.955 --> 40:42.529
Uh, it's Titembay, right?

40:42.625 --> 40:45.745
Yeah, it's weird, huh?
You're, like, so freaked out right now.

40:45.836 --> 40:48.791
You're running for the door. lt's OK.
You can go. Don't feel bad--

40:48.881 --> 40:50.376
- Stop doing that.
- What?

40:50.466 --> 40:54.132
The thing you just did. Don't do that.
l want to be here. lf l didn't, l wouldn't be.

40:54.220 --> 40:57.138
Trust me, my family is way more
fucked up than yours, OK?

40:57.224 --> 40:58.884
OK.

40:58.976 --> 41:01.847
So... Titembay.

41:01.938 --> 41:04.179
Yeah, he's my brother.

41:04.273 --> 41:06.978
- ls he adopted, or...?
- Kind of.

41:07.068 --> 41:09.475
My mom adopted him
from Sally Struthers years ago.

41:09.570 --> 41:12.442
One of those ''For the cost
of a cup of coffee a day'' things.

41:12.533 --> 41:15.570
Where she's like, ''How can you
sit there and not help the children?''

41:15.661 --> 41:18.661
And we just couldn't sit there
and not help the children.

41:18.747 --> 41:23.077
So, we start sending him, like,
pictures and letters and stuff for years,

41:23.168 --> 41:26.788
but then l got really into ice skating,
so we sort of forgot about him.

41:26.882 --> 41:30.251
Then one day... we get this phone call,
and it's Titembay.

41:30.344 --> 41:33.095
He's at the dry cleaners
around the corner. And he's like,

41:33.179 --> 41:36.763
''l'm at Rutgers. l live in the dorms,
but l'm used to living with my tribe,

41:36.851 --> 41:41.347
so l'd rather live with a family.''
And he's been living with us ever since.

41:41.439 --> 41:43.895
Wow.

41:43.984 --> 41:47.898
l know. He's the most amazing guy.
You ought to hear some of his stories.

41:47.988 --> 41:50.942
He struggled through so much
because he wanted to learn.

41:51.033 --> 41:55.197
When l think of what he's accomplished,
l just, l just feel, like, lazy, you know?

41:55.287 --> 41:57.614
He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers,

41:57.708 --> 42:01.491
and when he was a baby, he was one of
those kids with the flies all over his face.

42:02.670 --> 42:07.084
Wow.
l mean, it's a crazy story.

42:07.175 --> 42:10.759
Yeah, l know. l mean,
that's a true story. l am not that good.

42:10.847 --> 42:14.511
Ohh... this is Tickle.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.557
What is Tickle?

42:16.644 --> 42:19.135
Tickle's my favorite thing
in the whole world.

42:19.230 --> 42:22.232
lt's all that's left of Nanny, my blanket.

42:22.318 --> 42:24.441
- Tickle's all that remains.
- Mm-hmm.

42:24.528 --> 42:26.984
- Was there, like, a hurricane?
- Shut up!

42:27.073 --> 42:30.406
No, l mean...
l've had this since l was a baby.

42:30.492 --> 42:34.574
lt's what they brought me
home in from the hospital.

42:34.664 --> 42:37.500
- lt's like the Wailing Wall.
- What?

42:37.584 --> 42:40.372
Oh, the Wailing Wall is, like, this...

42:40.462 --> 42:43.582
lt's, like, the most holy place for Jews
to go and pray in lsrael.

42:43.674 --> 42:48.586
lt's all that's left of this enormous temple
that was destroyed by the Romans.

42:48.680 --> 42:51.716
- So you're, like, really Jewish.
- What?

42:51.808 --> 42:54.479
You are, aren't you? You are.

42:54.562 --> 42:57.099
l'm not. l mean, l'm Jewish,
but l'm not really Jewish.

42:57.189 --> 42:59.182
l mean, l don't do anything Jewish.

42:59.274 --> 43:02.644
l don't go to temple or anything, but l
don't know any Jews that go to temple.

43:02.736 --> 43:06.605
The Jews l know, they go on one day.
lt's Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.

43:06.700 --> 43:08.194
OK.

43:08.285 --> 43:11.369
Did you know that most temples
are built with moveable walls,

43:11.454 --> 43:14.124
so that on the one day of the year
when everyone comes to repent,

43:14.207 --> 43:17.079
they can actually make
the room big enough to hold everyone?

43:17.170 --> 43:20.087
l don't really believe in God.

43:20.173 --> 43:22.795
- Just Tickle.
- Oh, l believe in Tickle.

43:25.137 --> 43:28.304
- We're not gonna make out or anything.
- What?

43:28.390 --> 43:31.178
l'm sorry. l just totally
ruined that moment, didn't l?

43:31.268 --> 43:34.720
- lt's just, we're not gonna make out, OK?
- No, l hadn't planned on trying--

43:34.814 --> 43:37.519
Oh, l am so lame.
That was, like, really--

43:37.609 --> 43:41.523
l'm... l'm sorry. Forget l just said that.
l'm-- That was dumb.

43:41.613 --> 43:44.649
You know what l do when l feel
completely unoriginal?

43:44.741 --> 43:45.773
What?

43:46.910 --> 43:50.659
Blah, blah, blah, blah, la!

43:50.748 --> 43:54.034
l-l make a noise, or l do something
that no one has ever done before,

43:54.126 --> 43:57.959
and then l can feel unique again,
even if it's only for, like, a second.

43:58.047 --> 44:01.630
- So, no one's ever done that?
- No. Not in this spot, no.

44:01.718 --> 44:05.254
You just witnessed a completely
original moment in human history.

44:05.348 --> 44:07.471
- lt's refreshing. You should try it.
- No, thanks.

44:07.559 --> 44:09.681
- Come on.
- No, l think that was good enough

44:09.768 --> 44:12.604
- for the both of us.
- Come on! What are you, shy?

44:12.688 --> 44:16.983
This is your one opportunity to do
something no one has ever done before,

44:17.069 --> 44:19.525
that no one will copy again
throughout human existence.

44:19.613 --> 44:21.855
And if nothing else,
you'll be remembered

44:21.949 --> 44:26.113
as the one guy who ever did this -
this one thing.

44:28.164 --> 44:30.702
Uh...

44:36.465 --> 44:39.715
- How was that?
- Oh, l've done that one before.

44:41.095 --> 44:45.223
So, l got to go bury this hamster
before the dogs eat him.

44:45.308 --> 44:48.014
Wanna help? Hmm?

44:52.566 --> 44:55.318
Stood beneath an orange sky

44:59.199 --> 45:02.615
- Wow.
- Yeah.

45:02.703 --> 45:04.944
- l mean, this is, uh--
- l know.

45:05.997 --> 45:08.073
lt's not that we're bad pet owners.

45:08.166 --> 45:12.035
lt's just, you know, we've had
so many of them over the years.

45:12.129 --> 45:14.455
Besides, a lot of these are fish.

45:14.549 --> 45:17.040
After you.

45:24.726 --> 45:27.514
All right.

45:29.940 --> 45:31.933
Sit down.

45:39.326 --> 45:41.318
What are you thinking about?

45:42.621 --> 45:45.113
- Now?
- Yeah.

45:45.208 --> 45:48.576
- Right now?
- Yeah.

45:48.669 --> 45:52.038
Right now, l was thinking l've been going
to a lot of these things lately.

45:52.131 --> 45:54.705
- What, dates?
- Not dates.

45:54.801 --> 45:57.803
This is a date?
This isn't a date.

45:57.888 --> 45:59.964
Funerals.

46:00.057 --> 46:02.049
Why? Who else died?

46:03.727 --> 46:05.720
Oh, um...

46:06.688 --> 46:10.106
That's why l'm home, actually.
l guess l haven't even told you that yet.

46:14.072 --> 46:16.444
My mom just died.

46:21.330 --> 46:24.118
God, that's weird
to say that out loud, but, uh...

46:25.960 --> 46:31.335
My mom just died, and...
yeah, that's why l'm home.

46:32.259 --> 46:35.842
l'm so sorry.
God, l'm so sorry.

46:35.929 --> 46:38.681
And here l am, putting you
through another one of these.

46:38.766 --> 46:42.681
Not that Jelly's anywhere near your mom.
l mean, we loved Jelly, but...

46:44.564 --> 46:48.348
- l'm so sorry.
- No, it's OK. lt's all right.

46:48.443 --> 46:50.436
l'm all right with it.

46:50.529 --> 46:53.365
Anyway, l think it's
what she wanted, so...

46:53.449 --> 46:55.857
How did she die?

46:57.495 --> 46:59.487
She drowned, actually.

47:02.124 --> 47:04.118
Yeah, my mother was a paraplegic.

47:04.211 --> 47:07.995
She was in a wheelchair,
so she... you know.

47:08.090 --> 47:13.843
And... l guess she was taking a bath,
and she must have slipped or something.

47:13.929 --> 47:15.887
That's what they say.
l don't know.

47:15.974 --> 47:18.382
But, needless to say, she drowned,

47:18.476 --> 47:22.309
and that's how she... she died.

47:22.397 --> 47:24.805
When?

47:24.900 --> 47:27.142
This was, uh...

47:28.320 --> 47:30.278
...Sunday.

47:30.364 --> 47:33.365
Oh, my God.

47:38.249 --> 47:40.206
Why are you crying?

47:42.127 --> 47:44.120
l don't know. l'm sorry.

47:45.506 --> 47:48.839
l'm not usually like this.
lt's just, like...

47:50.387 --> 47:52.380
lt's just so sad.

47:52.473 --> 47:54.715
You know, it's like...

47:54.808 --> 47:56.765
lt's so tragic, isn't it? lt is.

47:56.851 --> 48:01.894
l mean, it's like, it's like real-life tragedy
or something. l mean...

48:01.983 --> 48:04.937
Anyway, let's just,
let's change the subject, OK?

48:05.028 --> 48:07.067
Let's really bring
the focus back to Jelly,

48:07.155 --> 48:10.274
'cause what could be ruder than talking
about someone else who died

48:10.366 --> 48:13.119
when you're in the act
of burying a close friend?

48:14.330 --> 48:16.322
- Well, what should we do?
- l don't know.

48:16.415 --> 48:19.665
l've only been to one of these things.
You appear to be the expert.

48:19.752 --> 48:22.587
Well, we usually say something.

48:22.672 --> 48:25.673
OK, l'll go first. Um...

48:27.552 --> 48:30.719
Didn't really know you, Jelly.
From what l hear, you were a good pet.

48:30.806 --> 48:33.131
- Little trouble with the wheel--
- That's not funny.

48:39.023 --> 48:41.431
Jelly, you were a great pet.

48:43.569 --> 48:46.061
l'm sorry l forgot to take
the wheel out of your cage.

48:46.156 --> 48:48.564
l'm so, so sorry about that.

48:50.161 --> 48:52.829
Goodbye.

48:52.913 --> 48:55.119
l hope that you liked me.

49:13.353 --> 49:15.511
If I lived

49:15.605 --> 49:22.273
Till I was 1 02

49:23.072 --> 49:28.493
I just don't think I'll ever

49:28.577 --> 49:32.707
Get over you

49:38.380 --> 49:41.915
Holy shit! You scared the shit out of me.
Why are you always doing that?

49:42.009 --> 49:46.222
- l haven't seen you in a while.
- l've been catching up with people here--

49:46.306 --> 49:49.757
Dr. Cohen called.
There's nothing wrong with you.

49:49.850 --> 49:53.136
Yeah, l think l'm starting
to figure that out myself.

49:53.229 --> 49:56.979
- When are you thinking of leaving?
- Uh, probably tomorrow.

49:57.068 --> 50:01.279
Um... you know, l got a lot of stuff
l got to take care of in L.A.

50:02.156 --> 50:04.825
- Probably have to find a new job, so--
- We need to talk.

50:06.036 --> 50:08.906
Yeah. How?
l mean, when?

50:09.998 --> 50:12.620
What are you doing now?

50:14.086 --> 50:17.705
Now's not good, 'cause l told my friend
Mark l was gonna meet up with him.

50:17.798 --> 50:20.254
But how about, like, later tonight?

50:20.343 --> 50:23.510
- OK, then, we'll talk.
- Yeah.

50:23.596 --> 50:26.681
We owe that to each other.

50:26.766 --> 50:28.760
Yeah.

50:28.853 --> 50:30.846
We owe it to her.

50:32.439 --> 50:34.812
Yeah.

50:34.900 --> 50:36.893
Good.

50:36.986 --> 50:38.979
Sorry l scared you.

50:41.742 --> 50:43.984
How could you leave all that lithium?

50:44.078 --> 50:46.615
l was totally gonna
hit you up for some, man.

50:46.705 --> 50:50.038
This fucking guy.
l'm glad you're back, man.

50:50.125 --> 50:54.076
'Cause this town is so messed up.
Everyone's got their drug of choice.

50:54.172 --> 50:56.924
lt's like in Brave New World.
You ever read that book?

50:57.008 --> 51:00.128
Who wrote that? Aldous...

51:00.219 --> 51:03.305
Aldous something. Aldous...

51:03.390 --> 51:05.467
Anyway, there's, like,

51:05.559 --> 51:09.344
Alphas and Betas and Epsilons
and all sorts of people...

51:23.078 --> 51:25.487
Huxtable.

51:25.582 --> 51:29.709
Aldous Huxtable.
That's it, bro.

51:44.935 --> 51:48.804
Andrew, would you like to see
Sam's ice-skating tape?

51:48.899 --> 51:50.726
- Mom, no.
- Absolutely.

51:50.818 --> 51:54.234
She was so ahead of her time.
She could have gone to the Olympics.

51:54.321 --> 51:56.314
No, no, no, no.
l couldn't have.

51:56.406 --> 51:59.657
Yes, you could've. Don't blame it
on the epilepsy. You had a gift.

51:59.744 --> 52:02.745
Come on, let me see it.

52:02.831 --> 52:06.330
Let's show him the ''Florida Stars
of the lce'' opening. The gator costume.

52:06.418 --> 52:09.668
- Mom, l'm asking you seriously.
- Oh, come on. Don't be shy.

52:09.755 --> 52:12.127
- Let me see it.
- Oh, she wants you to see it.

52:12.216 --> 52:14.837
How could you not want him
to see how talented you are?

52:14.927 --> 52:18.343
- Were.
- Come on.

52:18.973 --> 52:20.930
- Come on.
- Ugh.

52:22.686 --> 52:25.603
- Honey, what are you doing?
- l'm dusting for prints.

52:25.730 --> 52:28.186
Could we move
the crime scene into the kitchen?

52:28.275 --> 52:29.935
l want to show Andrew Sam's skating.

52:30.027 --> 52:33.479
Someone's pissing on my GameCube,
and l'm about to close the case.

52:33.573 --> 52:38.401
- lt wasn't me, Your Honor.
- Paw prints point to a canine. Hmm.

52:38.495 --> 52:40.452
Andrew, sit down here on the couch.

52:40.538 --> 52:43.290
l can't believe you're showing him this.

52:46.420 --> 52:48.994
Look, there she is.

53:01.854 --> 53:06.315
- You're the alligator?
- You can tell by the hands.

53:29.717 --> 53:31.462
Here comes the double axel.

53:31.554 --> 53:34.175
And... land.

53:34.265 --> 53:37.799
- Oh, l mean, come on. ls she good?
- Wow! She's great.

53:41.271 --> 53:42.683
All right.

53:42.774 --> 53:45.230
- Wow.
- Shut up.

53:45.319 --> 53:47.810
No, l mean, your mom's right.
You're really good.

53:49.490 --> 53:51.565
This was awesome, but we got to go.

53:51.658 --> 53:53.652
l just wanted to show him how talented--

53:53.744 --> 53:55.702
- Mom, come on!
- My baby!

53:55.788 --> 53:58.077
All right, go on.
Go on, get away.

53:58.166 --> 54:01.665
Wait a minute.
Give me a hug.

54:01.753 --> 54:04.078
l love you so much.
l'm so proud of you.

54:04.172 --> 54:06.165
- l love you, too.
- Have a good night.

54:06.258 --> 54:08.666
- Thanks for dinner.
- Come, you're giving me a hug, too.

54:08.761 --> 54:11.596
- Mom, come on.
- l'll take a hug.

54:20.356 --> 54:23.227
- Good night. See you later, Tim.
- Bye, Tim.

54:23.318 --> 54:26.485
Peace out, player.

54:27.365 --> 54:28.610
It was the only thing
I ever liked doing.

54:28.783 --> 54:32.199
pretending to be someone else.

54:32.287 --> 54:36.783
l've been so out of it, the only parts l get
offered are playing handicapped people.

54:37.041 --> 54:40.661
- That is not funny.
- Come on, you got to see that's a joke.

54:40.755 --> 54:44.705
lf you can't laugh at yourself, life's gonna
seem a whole lot longer than you'd like.

54:44.801 --> 54:47.006
All right, so, what are we
laughing at you about?

54:47.094 --> 54:49.170
Mmm...

54:49.263 --> 54:52.016
l lied again.
l have epilepsy.

54:52.100 --> 54:54.805
Which part are we laughing about?

54:54.895 --> 54:58.311
l, um...

54:58.399 --> 55:00.854
l had a seizure
at the law office where l work.

55:00.943 --> 55:04.359
Their insurance wouldn't cover me
unless l wore preventative covering.

55:04.447 --> 55:08.908
- What's preventative covering?
- The helmet l was wearing.

55:08.993 --> 55:11.911
Oh, come on!
That's funny.

55:11.997 --> 55:15.496
That's really funny. l'm the only person
who wears a helmet to work

55:15.584 --> 55:20.246
who isn't, like, putting out fires
or, like, racing for NASCAR.

55:20.339 --> 55:22.747
But what do you do?
l mean, l can't quit.

55:22.842 --> 55:25.416
Their insurance is amazing.
What do you do?

55:25.512 --> 55:28.182
You laugh, you know?
l'm not saying l don't cry.

55:28.265 --> 55:30.934
But in between... l laugh.

55:31.017 --> 55:35.727
And l realize how silly it is
to take anything too seriously.

55:35.815 --> 55:38.982
Plus, l look forward to a good cry.

55:39.069 --> 55:41.227
Feels pretty good.

55:42.948 --> 55:46.114
l haven't cried since l was a little kid.

55:46.200 --> 55:48.278
l didn't cry at my mother's funeral.

55:48.370 --> 55:50.612
l tried, you know?

55:50.706 --> 55:54.953
l thought of all the saddest things
l could think of, like things in movies...

55:55.044 --> 55:59.208
There's this image from Life magazine
that's always haunted me,

55:59.299 --> 56:04.542
and l just, l focused in on it, you know?
But nothing came.

56:04.638 --> 56:06.678
That actually made me
sadder than anything,

56:06.765 --> 56:10.895
- the fact that l just felt so numb.
- What do you mean?

56:10.979 --> 56:13.469
- Just that--
- Hey, vagina!

56:15.066 --> 56:17.023
Hey, what's up, guys?

56:17.110 --> 56:21.275
Uh, Sam, that's Mark, Dave,
and you remember Jesse.

56:21.365 --> 56:23.654
- What's up?
- Hey, nice to meet you.

56:23.743 --> 56:26.826
l'm sorry l said ''vagina'' just now.
l didn't know you were here.

56:26.912 --> 56:29.664
- Oh, that's OK.
- Nice.

56:29.748 --> 56:34.079
Let's get fucked up.

56:34.171 --> 56:38.251
One, two, three! Whoo!

56:43.431 --> 56:45.388
What are you doing?

56:45.475 --> 56:47.681
Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.

56:47.769 --> 56:50.177
lt's so warm!

56:50.272 --> 56:52.679
Can you swim?

56:52.774 --> 56:54.933
Of course l can swim.

57:12.796 --> 57:17.043
Dude, maybe you should stay
on the steps. l don't know CPR.

57:17.134 --> 57:19.175
You look like a wet beaver.

57:34.821 --> 57:38.403
There's a handful of normal kid things
I kind of missed.

57:38.490 --> 57:43.450
There's a handful of normal
kid things I kind of wish I'd missed.

57:43.539 --> 57:46.208
You know that point
in your life when you realize

57:46.292 --> 57:49.957
the house you grew up in
isn't really your home anymore?

57:50.046 --> 57:53.249
All of a sudden, even though you have
someplace where you put your shit,

57:53.341 --> 57:55.832
that idea of home is gone.

57:58.263 --> 58:01.466
l still feel at home in my house.

58:01.558 --> 58:06.102
You'll see. When you move out, it just
sort of happens. One day, it's gone.

58:06.188 --> 58:09.889
And you feel like
you can never get it back.

58:09.984 --> 58:13.353
lt's like you feel homesick
for a place that doesn't even exist.

58:16.075 --> 58:18.281
Or maybe it's like this
rite of passage, you know?

58:18.369 --> 58:20.859
You'll never have
that feeling again until you create

58:20.954 --> 58:22.994
a new idea of ''home''
for yourself, you know?

58:23.081 --> 58:25.834
For your kids, for the family you start.

58:25.919 --> 58:27.995
lt's like a cycle or something.

58:29.881 --> 58:32.551
l don't know, but l miss
the idea of it, you know?

58:36.387 --> 58:38.677
Maybe that's all a family really is...

58:40.226 --> 58:43.061
...a group of people who miss
the same imaginary place.

58:53.907 --> 58:55.900
Maybe.

58:57.369 --> 59:00.740
Are you ready? Whoo!

59:08.256 --> 59:10.712
How about some fuckin' furniture, dude?

59:10.802 --> 59:13.174
l bought a chair,
but l didn't like it.

59:13.263 --> 59:15.670
- Where is it?
- lt's keeping us warm.

59:26.444 --> 59:29.017
Silent Velcro.

59:29.113 --> 59:31.069
You lucky motherfucker.

59:31.156 --> 59:35.618
l feel like if l'd shown up at school
and presented the idea of silent Velcro,

59:35.704 --> 59:38.029
they would've sent me away
a whole lot sooner.

59:38.123 --> 59:41.872
- Why did they send you away?
- Ooh, listen to this girl.

59:41.960 --> 59:45.164
- They didn't send me away.
- You just said they sent you away.

59:45.256 --> 59:47.544
They sent me away.
They sent me to boarding school.

59:47.633 --> 59:51.501
''Sent me away'' sounds like l went
to some asylum. There were no straps.

59:51.596 --> 59:54.680
Why did they send you
to boarding school?

59:54.766 --> 59:56.807
They sent me to boarding school

59:56.894 --> 1:00:01.022
because they thought
l might be dangerous.

1:00:01.106 --> 1:00:05.104
''You're so freaked out. You're running for
the door. You can go. Don't feel bad.''

1:00:05.194 --> 1:00:08.646
That's really funny.
That's really funny.

1:00:08.740 --> 1:00:10.733
Why would they think
you'd be dangerous?

1:00:10.826 --> 1:00:14.408
- You're like a little detective.
- Well...

1:00:14.496 --> 1:00:16.572
- Yeah?
- You're gay.

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:20.207
No.

1:00:20.294 --> 1:00:22.287
Drum roll.

1:00:27.177 --> 1:00:29.584
l was the reason
she was in a wheelchair.

1:00:30.722 --> 1:00:32.715
l pushed her.

1:00:34.101 --> 1:00:36.260
So, there that is.

1:00:38.481 --> 1:00:40.687
- Shut up.
- Fuck off.

1:00:40.775 --> 1:00:42.934
No, it's the truth.

1:00:43.027 --> 1:00:44.438
Why?

1:00:44.529 --> 1:00:46.985
Just a complete
freak accident, you know?

1:00:47.073 --> 1:00:49.446
One of those things
you replay a million times,

1:00:49.534 --> 1:00:53.035
and you see how clearly
it was just a complete freak thing.

1:00:53.123 --> 1:00:56.870
l mean, my whole life,
she was depressed for no reason.

1:00:56.959 --> 1:01:01.206
And one day, you know -
l was a little kid. l was nine years old -

1:01:01.297 --> 1:01:04.168
and l just hated her for that,

1:01:04.259 --> 1:01:06.632
and l pushed her.

1:01:06.721 --> 1:01:09.971
And it was innocent. l was just
completely frustrated, because--

1:01:10.057 --> 1:01:13.342
- Because you couldn't make her happy?
- Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

1:01:13.435 --> 1:01:16.437
And-And any other time,
you know, any other day,

1:01:16.523 --> 1:01:18.812
she would've yelled at me
and sent me to my room.

1:01:18.901 --> 1:01:23.978
But this day,
on this particular day,

1:01:24.073 --> 1:01:29.198
the door of the dishwasher...
had fallen open.

1:01:29.287 --> 1:01:33.154
The latch on it was broken,
and it would just randomly fall open.

1:01:33.249 --> 1:01:35.823
That fucking latch, you know...

1:01:35.919 --> 1:01:39.502
lt's-lt's really amazing how much
of my life has been determined

1:01:39.590 --> 1:01:41.915
by a quarter-inch piece of plastic, but...

1:01:43.385 --> 1:01:45.793
So, anyway,
she-she fell back over the door

1:01:45.888 --> 1:01:51.394
and hit her neck on the kitchen counter,
paralyzing her from the waist down.

1:01:51.478 --> 1:01:53.766
Wow.

1:01:53.855 --> 1:01:56.014
Still want to compare fucked-up families?

1:01:56.107 --> 1:01:59.358
But your mom was in
the wheelchair long before you left.

1:01:59.444 --> 1:02:02.281
Yeah. Well, l was nine.

1:02:02.365 --> 1:02:05.153
So, they sent me to therapy
and put me on these drugs

1:02:05.243 --> 1:02:07.365
that were supposed to curb my anger.

1:02:07.453 --> 1:02:10.490
And l've been on some
form of them since.

1:02:11.624 --> 1:02:14.959
And when l was 1 6, my psychiatrist dad
came around to the conclusion

1:02:15.046 --> 1:02:17.881
that it probably wasn't the best
environment for me to be in.

1:02:17.965 --> 1:02:22.710
So, he sent me to boarding school,
and l haven't been home since.

1:02:22.803 --> 1:02:25.176
- Until now.
- For her funeral.

1:02:25.265 --> 1:02:28.551
Until now, for her funeral.

1:02:28.644 --> 1:02:32.227
l can't believe the retarded
quarterback's a pill popper.

1:02:34.442 --> 1:02:36.399
Jesse?

1:02:36.485 --> 1:02:39.321
Where's the sauna?

1:02:39.405 --> 1:02:41.897
- l'll show her.
- No, l got it.

1:02:41.991 --> 1:02:43.237
No, you get her a towel.

1:02:47.415 --> 1:02:49.454
Want a ride, sweetheart?

1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:05.428
- You're in it right now, aren't you?
- What do you mean?

1:03:05.517 --> 1:03:08.388
My mom always says that when l'm
working something out in my head.

1:03:08.478 --> 1:03:10.971
She's like, ''You're in it right now.''

1:03:11.066 --> 1:03:14.482
And l'm looking at you,
and you're telling me this story,

1:03:14.569 --> 1:03:18.732
and... you're definitely in it right now.

1:03:19.949 --> 1:03:22.524
l think you're right.
l am in it.

1:03:25.915 --> 1:03:28.489
Yeah, whatever.
Could we just change the subject, OK?

1:03:28.584 --> 1:03:31.372
Let's just talk about good stuff.

1:03:31.463 --> 1:03:34.250
Good stuff?

1:03:34.341 --> 1:03:38.042
Like ''glass half full'' shit.
What do you got?

1:03:38.136 --> 1:03:41.091
Got a little buzz.
l got that.

1:03:42.224 --> 1:03:44.716
- What you got?
- l got a little buzz goin'.

1:03:48.189 --> 1:03:50.312
And l like you.

1:03:57.367 --> 1:03:59.822
So, there's that.

1:03:59.911 --> 1:04:01.867
l guess l have that.

1:04:08.337 --> 1:04:10.377
l can tap dance.
You want to see me tap dance?

1:04:10.464 --> 1:04:13.038
l would love to see you tap dance.

1:04:16.636 --> 1:04:22.012
So what if you catch me.
where would we land?

1:04:22.102 --> 1:04:27.642
In somebody's life for taking his hands

1:04:27.733 --> 1:04:33.072
See. I can tell

1:05:35.223 --> 1:05:37.798
What are you doing?

1:05:37.894 --> 1:05:41.512
You collect Desert Storm trading cards?

1:05:41.605 --> 1:05:44.441
Fuck, yeah.
Those things are collector's items, man.

1:05:44.525 --> 1:05:46.933
You have any idea how much
those are gonna be worth?

1:05:47.028 --> 1:05:49.698
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. That shit's an investment.

1:05:49.782 --> 1:05:51.609
l have lots of investments all over.

1:05:51.701 --> 1:05:55.780
One day l'm gonna sell all of them,
and just fuckin' live off of it.

1:05:55.871 --> 1:05:58.077
So, like, how much is this one worth?

1:05:58.165 --> 1:06:02.211
- Which?
- ''Night Vision Goggles.''

1:06:02.295 --> 1:06:05.665
l don't know. Mint?
Two, maybe three.

1:06:05.757 --> 1:06:07.834
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

1:06:07.927 --> 1:06:11.296
lt's too early. You don't sell yet.
Don't you know anything about investing?

1:06:11.389 --> 1:06:13.428
l'm gonna live off that shit.

1:06:13.516 --> 1:06:16.850
lf you have a complete set,
it's worth, like, thousands.

1:06:16.936 --> 1:06:18.514
So, do you have the complete set?

1:06:18.605 --> 1:06:21.641
Almost. The corners are bent
on my ''Friendly Fire,''

1:06:21.733 --> 1:06:23.607
and someone stole my ''Wolf Blitzer.''

1:06:29.617 --> 1:06:31.574
Now, look. What do you got to do today?

1:06:31.661 --> 1:06:35.197
'Cause, uh... l got you
a little going-away present,

1:06:35.290 --> 1:06:39.868
but, uh... l got to kinda track it down first.

1:06:39.961 --> 1:06:44.670
- So, can you give me a ride?
- Uh, yeah. l just...

1:06:44.758 --> 1:06:47.511
What?

1:06:47.595 --> 1:06:50.679
- No, nothing. l just...
- Say it, speak.

1:06:54.310 --> 1:06:57.976
l kind of told Sam l was gonna
hang out with her today, so...

1:06:58.065 --> 1:07:00.188
She can come.
l don't care.

1:07:19.171 --> 1:07:22.007
I could have been a sailor

1:07:22.091 --> 1:07:24.298
Could have been a cook

1:07:27.597 --> 1:07:29.673
A real live lover

1:07:29.766 --> 1:07:31.926
Could have been a book

1:07:35.814 --> 1:07:39.978
I could have been a signpost

1:07:40.069 --> 1:07:42.608
Could have been a clock

1:07:43.782 --> 1:07:45.822
As simple as a kettle

1:07:45.909 --> 1:07:48.660
Steady as a rock

1:07:51.665 --> 1:07:55.367
I could be here and now

1:07:59.508 --> 1:08:03.291
I would be. I should be.
but how ?

1:08:03.386 --> 1:08:07.136
l can't believe
we're in fuckin' Handi-World.

1:08:07.224 --> 1:08:09.466
We're getting money.
Don't look guilty.

1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:13.261
- How do l look guilty?
- Andrew Largeman?

1:08:13.356 --> 1:08:15.313
- Oh, no. Benson.
- Oh, no.

1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:17.393
- Who's that?
- Don't give him your number.

1:08:17.485 --> 1:08:19.893
Hey, man, what's up?

1:08:19.988 --> 1:08:21.482
- Holy shit!
- How's it going?

1:08:21.573 --> 1:08:24.610
l haven't seen you since, like, junior year.

1:08:24.701 --> 1:08:26.778
l thought you killed yourself.

1:08:26.870 --> 1:08:29.279
What?

1:08:29.374 --> 1:08:32.825
l thought you killed yourself.
That wasn't you?

1:08:32.919 --> 1:08:35.208
No, no. That wasn't me.

1:08:35.296 --> 1:08:37.419
Who killed themselves?

1:08:37.507 --> 1:08:40.260
That was the Gleason kid.
Oh, and Tina.

1:08:40.344 --> 1:08:42.302
- Tina who?
- You remember Tina.

1:08:42.388 --> 1:08:44.380
She was anorexic, did gymnastics...

1:08:44.473 --> 1:08:47.308
- Oh, gymnastics Tina? How'd she do it?
- l don't know.

1:08:47.393 --> 1:08:50.478
- She wasn't Jewish. l didn't bury her.
- l think it was sleeping pills.

1:08:50.564 --> 1:08:53.233
Or that car-in-the-garage thing. l forgot.

1:08:55.945 --> 1:08:58.317
Oh, sorry.
This is Sam, Karl. Karl, Sam.

1:08:58.405 --> 1:08:59.947
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:09:00.031 --> 1:09:02.570
l got to go find that thing.
You stay here. l'll be back.

1:09:02.660 --> 1:09:04.819
ls-ls it heavy, or...? OK.

1:09:04.913 --> 1:09:06.621
Weren't you on a TV show or something?

1:09:06.706 --> 1:09:09.079
Yeah, it was just this, just this show.

1:09:09.167 --> 1:09:11.575
So you're, like, working here?
That's cool.

1:09:11.670 --> 1:09:14.671
Only for a little while.
l'm opening my own business.

1:09:14.757 --> 1:09:16.833
Actually, l should talk to you about it.

1:09:16.926 --> 1:09:20.971
l'm looking for smart people like you,
Large. l should get your number.

1:09:21.055 --> 1:09:24.306
Yeah, definitely.
That'd be, that'd be cool.

1:09:24.393 --> 1:09:29.220
l'd like to talk to you - both -
about a good opportunity

1:09:29.314 --> 1:09:31.722
for you and your loved ones.

1:09:31.817 --> 1:09:34.308
We all have dreams.
l know l do.

1:09:34.403 --> 1:09:38.568
l'd like to talk to you about an exciting
opportunity that people are talking about.

1:09:38.658 --> 1:09:41.742
- We got to get going.
- Oh, OK. lt was good to see you, Karl.

1:09:41.828 --> 1:09:44.401
- l should get your number.
- Definitely. l'll call you,

1:09:44.497 --> 1:09:48.033
- 'cause l think he has it in his book.
- Nice to meet you.

1:09:48.127 --> 1:09:51.579
Why is it always the losers that
get caught up in the pyramid schemes?

1:09:51.673 --> 1:09:55.089
Why can't it be some charming, hot girl
nagging you incessantly to buy shit?

1:09:55.175 --> 1:09:58.711
- ls that what he's doing?
- Yeah, it's detergent or some shit.

1:09:58.805 --> 1:10:01.890
Why are you buying knives?
l don't need knives.

1:10:01.975 --> 1:10:04.846
- l'd like to return these.
- You got a receipt?

1:10:04.937 --> 1:10:07.393
Actually, no.
They were a gift.

1:10:07.481 --> 1:10:10.851
- Why are you returning these?
- They're not sharp enough.

1:10:10.943 --> 1:10:14.609
- They're not sharp enough?
- No, not for what we need them for.

1:10:14.697 --> 1:10:16.856
They couldn't cut cans.

1:10:16.950 --> 1:10:18.907
You bought them to cut cans?

1:10:18.994 --> 1:10:22.198
No, but in the commercial it said
if l wanted to cut cans, l could.

1:10:22.290 --> 1:10:25.243
- But with these knives, l can't.
- Well, it comes with a sharpener.

1:10:25.334 --> 1:10:27.790
- Did you try it?
- Yeah.

1:10:27.878 --> 1:10:30.417
They're just...

1:10:30.506 --> 1:10:33.343
l don't want them.
They're not sharp enough.

1:10:33.427 --> 1:10:35.420
OK.

1:10:37.348 --> 1:10:39.589
A major loophole
in the Handi-World return policy

1:10:39.683 --> 1:10:43.729
is that they permit returns
without receipts on items below $40.

1:10:43.813 --> 1:10:46.020
So, how often do you go?

1:10:46.107 --> 1:10:50.105
l hit every employee once,
and then l wait till they hire new ones.

1:10:50.195 --> 1:10:53.729
Luckily, nobody stays at Handi-World
very long, except Karl Benson.

1:10:53.823 --> 1:10:57.656
Mark, it's my last day in town. lf you
need money, l could loan you some--

1:10:57.745 --> 1:10:59.619
l don't need your money.
l'm making my own.

1:10:59.705 --> 1:11:01.497
Take Jesse's.
The guy's a millionaire.

1:11:01.582 --> 1:11:06.126
l don't take anybody's money, OK?
l make my own. Favors are bad news.

1:11:06.212 --> 1:11:11.124
The only thing worse than a favor
is a favor involving money, OK?

1:11:11.218 --> 1:11:14.753
Let's go. l got to see a guy
about a nitrous tank.

1:11:29.697 --> 1:11:32.449
Too low to find my way

1:11:32.534 --> 1:11:35.238
Too high to wonder why

1:11:35.327 --> 1:11:37.534
I've touched this place before

1:11:37.621 --> 1:11:40.195
Somewhere in another time

1:11:40.292 --> 1:11:42.866
Now I can hear the sun

1:11:42.962 --> 1:11:45.667
The clouds drifting through the blinds

1:11:45.756 --> 1:11:48.164
A half a million thoughts

1:11:48.259 --> 1:11:51.628
Are flowing through my mind

1:11:59.021 --> 1:12:01.346
What is this place?

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:03.646
l think you can see into hotel rooms.

1:12:03.734 --> 1:12:06.272
Come on, tough guy!
Come on, tough guy!

1:12:06.362 --> 1:12:08.355
Shut up!

1:12:12.368 --> 1:12:16.319
Yeah. Oh. oh! Yeah!

1:12:31.806 --> 1:12:34.013
l'm gonna fucking cum!

1:12:37.563 --> 1:12:40.055
That shit was hot.
That shit was hot.

1:12:40.149 --> 1:12:42.475
l got to go drop some knowledge
on that ho right there.

1:12:42.569 --> 1:12:47.064
- How do you know she's a hooker?
- Of course she's a fuckin' hooker.

1:12:47.156 --> 1:12:50.158
Girls who look like her
do not fuck guys that look like him

1:12:50.244 --> 1:12:53.031
unless it's for coke, money, or fame.

1:12:53.122 --> 1:12:56.206
Well, Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.

1:12:56.292 --> 1:12:59.792
- Who the fuck are you?
- This is Sam, this is Large.

1:12:59.879 --> 1:13:03.083
No offense, man, but why you
bringing these fucking people here?

1:13:03.174 --> 1:13:06.092
This is the guy who needs that thing.

1:13:06.178 --> 1:13:10.389
l brought you the tank, 'K?
Could you just tell us where to go now?

1:13:10.474 --> 1:13:13.974
- That thing come with balloons?
- What am l, a fucking birthday clown?

1:13:14.061 --> 1:13:17.561
No, it doesn't come with balloons, OK?
Suck it off the tap.

1:13:17.648 --> 1:13:20.353
And l need it back,
'cause that guy's holding my 39 bucks.

1:13:20.443 --> 1:13:23.279
All right, hold up. Hold up!

1:13:23.364 --> 1:13:25.606
Who here just saw some titties?

1:13:25.700 --> 1:13:28.534
Raise your hand
if you just saw some titties.

1:13:28.619 --> 1:13:30.576
Hmm?

1:13:34.125 --> 1:13:37.246
Thank you.
So everybody, just calm the fuck down.

1:13:38.380 --> 1:13:41.999
Now... you know where
Kiernan's Quarry is?

1:13:42.092 --> 1:13:44.665
- Down in Newark. right?
- Yeah.

1:13:44.761 --> 1:13:46.885
It's at the bottom
of Hillside and Rivington.

1:13:46.973 --> 1:13:49.381
Can't really see it from the street.
but it's there.

1:13:49.475 --> 1:13:52.311
Park your car at the gate
and hop the fence.

1:13:52.395 --> 1:13:57.022
At the bottom of the quarry. there's
a junkyard run by this guy named Albert.

1:13:57.109 --> 1:14:00.193
He's the one that tracked down
the piece you're looking for. all right?

1:14:00.279 --> 1:14:02.687
I'll call him right now
and tell him to expect you.

1:14:02.781 --> 1:14:04.774
OK, stop.

1:14:04.867 --> 1:14:07.239
- What the fuck are we doing?
- Just be patient, man.

1:14:07.328 --> 1:14:10.615
We've been patient all day,
but it's my last day in town.

1:14:10.707 --> 1:14:13.459
lf you told me we're going on scavenger
hunt for blow, l would've passed.

1:14:13.543 --> 1:14:15.999
Please. lf l was gonna get you coke,
we would've gone

1:14:16.088 --> 1:14:19.956
to the high school football practice.
We'd have been rolling five hours ago.

1:14:20.051 --> 1:14:22.091
We've corrupted
this innocent girl enough.

1:14:22.178 --> 1:14:25.179
- l'm not innocent.
- You are. That's what l like about you.

1:14:25.264 --> 1:14:28.716
l don't want this guy taking you to some
sketchy quarry in the middle of nowhere

1:14:28.810 --> 1:14:31.480
to find, like, crack whores
huffing turpentine

1:14:31.564 --> 1:14:35.265
or pit bulls raping each other,
or whatever it is you have us doing.

1:14:36.069 --> 1:14:40.315
Wow. That's, like, the most worked up
l've ever seen you.

1:14:40.406 --> 1:14:44.072
- He was protecting me.
- So?

1:14:44.161 --> 1:14:47.328
- He likes me.
- Don't be cute.

1:14:47.414 --> 1:14:49.740
He's my knight in shining armor.

1:14:49.833 --> 1:14:53.167
Don't talk about knights in front of Mark.
lt's a sore subject.

1:14:53.254 --> 1:14:56.789
l'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

1:14:56.883 --> 1:14:58.757
Pun intended?

1:14:58.843 --> 1:15:00.468
Oh, you're--

1:15:04.057 --> 1:15:06.051
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1:15:10.648 --> 1:15:12.605
Oh, my God.

1:15:12.691 --> 1:15:15.562
- Wow.
- l never even knew this was here.

1:15:15.653 --> 1:15:18.572
l've heard about it.
They were supposed to build a mall here.

1:15:18.657 --> 1:15:20.864
l remember reading about that
in the paper.

1:15:20.951 --> 1:15:24.948
They were digging or something, and
they break into this natural phenomenon.

1:15:25.038 --> 1:15:27.744
lt's like an underground
Grand Canyon or something.

1:15:27.834 --> 1:15:30.918
Now they're in some huge legal battle
over whether they can build here.

1:15:31.004 --> 1:15:33.756
Can you imagine the guy
whose job it is to fight for his right

1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:37.754
to build a mall on some, like,
geological phenomenon?

1:15:37.844 --> 1:15:42.424
They love their malls here, man. All right,
let's find this guy and get out of here.

1:15:42.516 --> 1:15:44.593
You're not gonna tell us
what we're getting?

1:15:44.685 --> 1:15:48.470
- lt's a surprise. You'll see.
- l think it's gonna rain.

1:15:54.446 --> 1:15:56.439
So, this is it.

1:15:58.075 --> 1:16:03.118
So, knock. Knock and barter
for Desert Storm trading cards.

1:16:03.206 --> 1:16:06.990
Don't tease me about my hobbies.
l don't tease you about being an asshole.

1:16:09.045 --> 1:16:11.371
OK.

1:16:22.518 --> 1:16:24.891
- Mark?
- Yeah. Albert?

1:16:25.564 --> 1:16:26.939
Come on in.

1:16:31.529 --> 1:16:36.772
Oh, man. You guys must be freezing.
Make yourselves warm by the fire.

1:16:36.868 --> 1:16:39.620
l'm just gonna go put her down, OK?
l'll be right back out.

1:16:46.253 --> 1:16:50.666
l must say... l'm continually impressed
with how each place you bring us to

1:16:50.758 --> 1:16:53.878
- continues to be weirder and weirder.
- What do you mean? This is nice.

1:16:53.970 --> 1:16:57.671
Oh, nothing. Just hanging out in an old
boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.

1:16:57.765 --> 1:16:59.890
lt's hardly the bottom, dude.

1:16:59.977 --> 1:17:02.016
Did you check out that cliff down there?

1:17:02.103 --> 1:17:06.102
Hey... this is my wife, Faye.

1:17:06.191 --> 1:17:08.765
Hi. Welcome.

1:17:08.861 --> 1:17:11.780
Please, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1:17:15.035 --> 1:17:19.115
- Man, it's really coming down out there.
- Yeah, it started pouring all of a sudden.

1:17:19.205 --> 1:17:24.449
Well, in a bad storm, l like to pretend
that this old boat's my own private ark.

1:17:24.545 --> 1:17:29.124
Unfortunately, if this is the apocalypse,
l'm not quite sure it still floats.

1:17:30.676 --> 1:17:34.545
- Listen, would anybody like some tea?
- l'd love some, thank you.

1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:37.641
Do you want some tea?
OK, l'll be right back.

1:17:38.769 --> 1:17:41.889
What is this place?
What is it that you do down here?

1:17:41.981 --> 1:17:45.564
Well, we're calling it Kiernan's Fault.
No one knows what it is.

1:17:45.652 --> 1:17:49.068
We haven't been able to explore it.
Meanwhile, while they're in litigation,

1:17:49.155 --> 1:17:51.825
they hired me to make sure
no one comes inside.

1:17:51.908 --> 1:17:53.735
Wow.

1:17:53.827 --> 1:17:57.696
But what they don't know
is that at night, l climb down.

1:17:57.790 --> 1:18:00.411
So how deep does it go?
Thank you.

1:18:00.501 --> 1:18:03.253
You know - thank you -
no one really knows.

1:18:03.337 --> 1:18:06.208
But l like to pretend it's infinite.

1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:10.879
lt's kind of an odd job -
guardian of an infinite abyss.

1:18:10.972 --> 1:18:13.094
Yeah. Yeah, l guess it is.

1:18:13.181 --> 1:18:15.851
But we also trade
and deal in antique jewelry.

1:18:17.227 --> 1:18:21.096
l suppose it is odd
that we live down here like this.

1:18:21.191 --> 1:18:24.109
- Not at all.
- lt never crossed my mind.

1:18:24.194 --> 1:18:27.563
Well... we think it's important.

1:18:27.655 --> 1:18:31.785
Why? What is it that
you think you're gonna find?

1:18:31.869 --> 1:18:34.443
l guess l just like the idea
of discovering something -

1:18:34.539 --> 1:18:39.960
of doing something that's completely
unique, that's never been done before.

1:18:40.045 --> 1:18:43.129
- Albert's Abyss.
- Well, maybe. Who knows?

1:18:43.215 --> 1:18:48.210
But you know what? That's all ego.
None of that really matters.

1:18:48.304 --> 1:18:53.300
lf l get to be with this person right here,
and our beautiful baby...

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:56.518
...that's all l need.

1:19:00.984 --> 1:19:04.734
Well, l suppose you want what you
came all the way down here for.

1:19:04.823 --> 1:19:06.780
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great.

1:19:06.866 --> 1:19:11.943
Now, it took me a while to track
this piece down, but l owe Diego huge.

1:19:14.248 --> 1:19:16.326
That's it.
Thank you so much.

1:19:16.418 --> 1:19:18.660
- Yeah.
- Really.

1:19:18.754 --> 1:19:23.546
Listen, good luck in the rain. Do you guys
want some garbage bags or something?

1:19:24.968 --> 1:19:27.508
- Yeah.
- OK. That actually would be great.

1:19:30.851 --> 1:19:35.976
Tom. get your plane right on time

1:19:36.732 --> 1:19:40.018
I know your part'll go fine

1:19:40.111 --> 1:19:43.028
Goodbye!

1:19:43.114 --> 1:19:46.151
- Hey, Albert!
- Yeah?

1:19:47.035 --> 1:19:49.657
Good luck exploring the infinite abyss.

1:19:49.747 --> 1:19:52.320
Thank you. Hey!

1:19:54.668 --> 1:19:56.910
You, too.

1:20:02.928 --> 1:20:07.589
I get the news.
I need on the weather report

1:20:07.682 --> 1:20:13.722
Oh. I can gather all the news I need
on the weather report

1:20:15.608 --> 1:20:22.145
Hey. I've got nothing
to do today but smile

1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:27.911
Da-do da-do doo-da.
and here I am

1:20:27.997 --> 1:20:30.702
The only living boy in New York

1:20:35.839 --> 1:20:39.588
Half of the time we're gone
but we don't know where

1:20:39.676 --> 1:20:42.214
And we don't know where

1:21:05.621 --> 1:21:09.620
Here I am

1:21:09.710 --> 1:21:11.786
Whoo!

1:21:16.633 --> 1:21:20.299
Half of the time we're gone
but we don't know where

1:21:20.388 --> 1:21:24.468
And we don't know where

1:21:24.559 --> 1:21:30.812
Tom. get your plane right on time

1:21:30.899 --> 1:21:36.985
I know that you've
been eager to fly. now

1:21:37.073 --> 1:21:42.828
Hey. let your honesty
shine. shine. shine. now

1:21:42.913 --> 1:21:45.997
Da-do da-do doo-da doo-da

1:21:46.082 --> 1:21:49.333
Like it shines on me

1:21:49.419 --> 1:21:53.252
The only living boy in New York

1:21:55.093 --> 1:21:58.462
The only living boy in New York

1:22:07.607 --> 1:22:11.984
So... l don't know
if l'm gonna see you, man.

1:22:13.946 --> 1:22:16.568
Don't you want to know
what's in the bag?

1:22:17.743 --> 1:22:21.443
To be honest,
l don't even care anymore.

1:22:27.295 --> 1:22:29.371
What is it?

1:22:31.591 --> 1:22:34.212
lt's my mom's favorite necklace.

1:22:34.302 --> 1:22:37.387
l'd be lying to you if l told you
it was my plan all along.

1:22:37.472 --> 1:22:41.518
But... l got it back to you, right?
That's got to be worth something.

1:22:43.771 --> 1:22:45.728
This whole day was about this?

1:22:47.817 --> 1:22:51.234
You didn't want it down there with her.
lt's better it's with you.

1:22:52.615 --> 1:22:54.275
OK.

1:22:58.453 --> 1:23:02.155
Hey, if you ever need a Kato,
you know where to find me.

1:23:17.016 --> 1:23:19.139
lt's funny, this...

1:23:20.186 --> 1:23:24.136
This necklace reminds me of this really
random memory of my mother.

1:23:26.526 --> 1:23:31.865
l was, l was a little kid, and l was crying
for one reason or another, and...

1:23:35.954 --> 1:23:39.619
...she was just, like, you know, cradling
me and rocking me back and forth.

1:23:39.707 --> 1:23:42.459
l can remember seeing
the little balls in this thing

1:23:42.544 --> 1:23:45.498
just sort of floating back and forth, and...

1:23:48.051 --> 1:23:51.550
And there was just, like, snot
dripping down my nose, right?

1:23:51.638 --> 1:23:56.050
And, uh...
she gave me her sleeve...

1:23:57.476 --> 1:23:59.933
...and she told me
to blow my nose into it.

1:24:05.862 --> 1:24:08.731
And l remember thinking,
even as a little kid,

1:24:09.573 --> 1:24:11.567
''Wow.

1:24:15.122 --> 1:24:17.114
This is love.''

1:24:20.627 --> 1:24:23.000
This is love.

1:24:24.131 --> 1:24:26.504
Large.

1:24:26.592 --> 1:24:29.297
- l think l see one.
- Shut up.

1:24:29.387 --> 1:24:32.174
Yeah, l do.
Wait, we should save it or something.

1:24:34.769 --> 1:24:39.097
OK, don't move. OK.

1:24:42.943 --> 1:24:46.479
We could put it in my scrapbook,
if l had a scrapbook.

1:24:46.573 --> 1:24:48.862
- That it?
- l think so.

1:24:48.951 --> 1:24:52.153
l don't really feel any more coming.

1:24:52.245 --> 1:24:55.366
Well, if you do, just let me know.
l'll get the cup, OK?

1:24:56.709 --> 1:24:59.082
This was such a good idea.

1:24:59.170 --> 1:25:01.661
- Who are you?
- l'm your new friend, Sam.

1:25:03.049 --> 1:25:04.163
Tissue?

1:25:08.931 --> 1:25:10.390
Come here.

1:25:20.735 --> 1:25:23.061
Fuck, this hurts so much.

1:25:23.154 --> 1:25:25.147
Yeah, l know.

1:25:26.158 --> 1:25:29.575
But that is life.

1:25:29.663 --> 1:25:32.331
lf nothing else, that's life, you know?

1:25:32.414 --> 1:25:34.407
lt's real.

1:25:34.500 --> 1:25:37.501
Sometimes it fuckin' hurts.

1:25:39.380 --> 1:25:42.501
To be honest, it's sort of all we have.

1:25:46.055 --> 1:25:47.632
Hmm.

1:25:51.810 --> 1:25:53.769
How are you feelin'?

1:25:56.275 --> 1:25:58.267
Safe.

1:26:00.653 --> 1:26:03.276
When l'm with you, l feel so safe.

1:26:05.868 --> 1:26:07.861
Like l'm home.

1:26:13.877 --> 1:26:17.745
They will see us waving

1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:22.835
From such great heights

1:26:22.928 --> 1:26:27.675
''Come down now . ''

1:26:27.768 --> 1:26:33.853
They'll say

1:26:33.940 --> 1:26:37.986
But everything looks perfect

1:26:38.071 --> 1:26:42.199
From far away...

1:26:54.255 --> 1:26:56.829
- Dad.
- Yeah.

1:26:56.925 --> 1:26:59.166
Ha.

1:26:59.259 --> 1:27:01.218
Come on in.

1:27:01.304 --> 1:27:04.175
- l'm sorry l woke you up.
- No, no. l was just reading.

1:27:05.559 --> 1:27:08.762
Where have you been?

1:27:08.854 --> 1:27:10.681
Everywhere.

1:27:10.773 --> 1:27:13.691
l've been on sort of a crazy journey
these last couple days.

1:27:13.776 --> 1:27:15.852
You've been avoiding me.

1:27:15.945 --> 1:27:18.697
No, l haven't been.
Come on.

1:27:20.909 --> 1:27:23.864
OK, maybe l have been.

1:27:23.955 --> 1:27:28.663
l'm sure you can find
lots of things in your life

1:27:28.751 --> 1:27:30.708
that you can be angry about.

1:27:30.795 --> 1:27:35.007
But what l do not understand
is why you're so angry at me.

1:27:35.092 --> 1:27:37.500
All l ever wanted was
for everyone to be happy again.

1:27:37.595 --> 1:27:40.429
- That's all l ever wanted.
- When were we all ever happy, Dad?

1:27:40.513 --> 1:27:42.839
You always say that.
l mean, when was that?

1:27:42.933 --> 1:27:46.683
What was this time that we were all so
happy? l don't have it in my memory.

1:27:46.771 --> 1:27:51.683
Maybe if l did, l could help
steer us back there, but l just...

1:27:51.777 --> 1:27:56.023
You know, you and l need to work on
being OK, if that's not in the cards for us.

1:27:58.409 --> 1:28:03.404
Well, we might have a shot at it, if you
can forgive yourself for what you did.

1:28:04.624 --> 1:28:08.373
What l did.
What l did.

1:28:08.461 --> 1:28:10.917
OK. Let's do it, OK?
We're here, right?

1:28:11.006 --> 1:28:14.173
Let's do it. l'm gonna forgive myself
for what l did. Are you ready?

1:28:14.259 --> 1:28:18.803
l was a little boy,
and somebody made a shitty latch.

1:28:18.889 --> 1:28:21.642
That's what l think
about the whole thing, OK?

1:28:21.727 --> 1:28:24.478
And l'm not gonna take those drugs
anymore. They left me numb.

1:28:24.562 --> 1:28:28.227
l have felt so fucking numb to everything
l've experienced in my life, OK?

1:28:28.316 --> 1:28:30.309
And for that...

1:28:31.279 --> 1:28:33.852
...for that l'm here to forgive you.

1:28:33.948 --> 1:28:38.823
You've always said all you wanted was
for us to have whatever it is we wanted.

1:28:38.911 --> 1:28:42.613
Well, maybe what Mom wanted more
than anything was for it to all be over.

1:28:45.836 --> 1:28:50.249
And for me... what l want more
than anything in the world

1:28:50.341 --> 1:28:53.377
is for it to be OK with you
for me to feel something again...

1:28:54.804 --> 1:28:56.761
...even if it's pain.

1:28:58.308 --> 1:29:01.060
Going against
your doctor's recommendation

1:29:01.144 --> 1:29:03.980
is a pretty weighty experiment
to take on, don't you think?

1:29:09.111 --> 1:29:11.353
This is my life, Dad.

1:29:12.156 --> 1:29:14.149
This is it.

1:29:14.242 --> 1:29:16.699
l've spent 26 years waiting
for something else to start.

1:29:16.787 --> 1:29:21.864
So, no. l don't think it's too much to take
on, because it's everything there is.

1:29:21.958 --> 1:29:24.200
l see now it's all there is.

1:29:28.341 --> 1:29:30.749
You and l are gonna be OK.
You know that, right?

1:29:37.559 --> 1:29:41.889
We may not be as happy as you
always dreamed we would be, but...

1:29:45.485 --> 1:29:48.022
...for the first time,
let's just allow ourselves

1:29:48.112 --> 1:29:50.651
to be whatever it is that we are.

1:29:53.368 --> 1:29:55.326
And that will be better, OK?

1:29:59.500 --> 1:30:02.335
l think that will be better.

1:30:22.442 --> 1:30:25.064
What are you thinking about?

1:30:25.154 --> 1:30:27.111
You're not coming back, are you?

1:30:27.198 --> 1:30:29.867
- Come on, Sam. Of course l am.
- No, you're not.

1:30:29.951 --> 1:30:31.907
You don't realize this is good.

1:30:31.994 --> 1:30:34.745
This doesn't happen often in your life,
you know?

1:30:34.830 --> 1:30:37.156
l mean, this...

1:30:37.250 --> 1:30:39.576
We can work this stuff out.

1:30:39.670 --> 1:30:42.291
l want to help you, you know?

1:30:42.381 --> 1:30:46.592
We need each other.
l haven't even lied in, like, two days.

1:30:46.676 --> 1:30:49.003
ls that true?

1:30:49.096 --> 1:30:51.089
No.

1:30:54.477 --> 1:30:58.807
Look, this isn't, this isn't a conversation
about this being over.

1:30:58.899 --> 1:31:03.775
lt's-lt's... l'm not, like, putting a period
at the end of this, you know?

1:31:03.862 --> 1:31:06.780
l'm putting, like, an ellipsis on it.

1:31:06.866 --> 1:31:09.618
'Cause l'm worried that
if l don't go figure myself out,

1:31:09.702 --> 1:31:11.660
if l don't go land on my own two feet,

1:31:11.747 --> 1:31:16.076
then l'm just gonna fuck this whole
thing up, and this is too important.

1:31:20.922 --> 1:31:23.960
l got to go.
l... l got to go.

1:31:26.137 --> 1:31:29.054
l fired my psychiatrist.
l got to go find a new one.

1:31:31.726 --> 1:31:34.135
Look, l'm gonna call you
when l get there.

1:31:35.689 --> 1:31:37.848
l'm gonna call you, and...

1:31:43.864 --> 1:31:45.858
Look at me.

1:31:48.245 --> 1:31:50.237
Look at me.

1:31:57.546 --> 1:31:59.954
You changed my life.

1:32:06.348 --> 1:32:10.298
You changed my life,
and l've known you four days.

1:32:14.231 --> 1:32:16.853
This is the beginning
of something really big.

1:32:19.530 --> 1:32:21.487
But right now, l've got to go.

1:32:29.081 --> 1:32:30.624
Come here.

1:33:12.754 --> 1:33:15.211
Drink up. baby. down

1:33:15.299 --> 1:33:19.428
Mmm. are you in or are you out?

1:33:19.512 --> 1:33:22.085
Leave your things behind

1:33:22.181 --> 1:33:26.096
'Cause it's all going off without you

1:33:26.186 --> 1:33:32.770
Excuse me.
too busy writing your tragedy

1:33:32.860 --> 1:33:36.145
These mishaps you bubble wrap

1:33:36.238 --> 1:33:40.319
When you've no idea what you're like

1:33:46.082 --> 1:33:48.574
Take your seats as quickly as possible.

1:33:59.847 --> 1:34:02.885
- What are you doing?
- Do you remember that idea l had

1:34:02.977 --> 1:34:06.310
about working stuff out,
then finding you once l figured stuff out?

1:34:06.396 --> 1:34:09.101
- The ellipsis?
- Yeah, the ellipsis. lt's dumb.

1:34:09.191 --> 1:34:11.349
lt's an awful idea,
and l'm not gonna do it, OK?

1:34:11.443 --> 1:34:13.437
'Cause like you said, this is it.

1:34:13.530 --> 1:34:15.439
This is life.

1:34:15.532 --> 1:34:17.571
And l'm in love with you, Samantha.

1:34:18.910 --> 1:34:22.361
l think that's the only thing l've ever
been really sure of in my entire life.

1:34:22.455 --> 1:34:25.825
l'm really messed up right now,
and l've got a lot of stuff to work out,

1:34:25.918 --> 1:34:29.003
but l don't want to waste any more
of my life without you in it, OK?

1:34:29.088 --> 1:34:31.543
- Yeah.
- And l think l can do this. l want to.

1:34:31.632 --> 1:34:33.375
- We have to, right?
- Yeah.

1:34:33.467 --> 1:34:35.508
- Right?
- Yes!

1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:40.133
So, what do we do?

1:34:45.565 --> 1:34:47.890
What do we do?
