WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:08.258
Madeline Gleason
from Forest Hills.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.760
Looks like Madeline Gleason
put up one hell of a fight.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.637
She was 25
years old.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.306
When I was 25, I was
living in Alphabet City

00:15.390 --> 00:17.267
with some musclehead
named Dario.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.810
ERIN:
Morning.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.103
What do we have here?

00:20.186 --> 00:22.105
DANNY: 25-year-old,
apparent suffocation,

00:22.188 --> 00:23.815
defensive wounds on her hands.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.942
BAEZ:
Looks like she was dressed
for a date, possibly

00:26.025 --> 00:28.111
knew her killer.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.111
Witness called it in.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.280
Well, if you end up
running any lineups, just...

00:30.363 --> 00:32.115
We haven't even started yet.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.950
I'm just saying if you do,

00:34.033 --> 00:35.702
then make sure
to run a double blind.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.287
You can't run it yourself.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.456
This isn't our first rodeo,
you know, Counselor.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.749
Okay, I'm just reminding you

00:40.832 --> 00:42.125
'cause the D.A.'s been
on my ass about it.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.461
Oh, well, just because
the D.A.'s been on your ass,

00:44.544 --> 00:46.629
doesn't mean you got
to be on my ass.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.672
Yeah, it kind of does.

00:47.756 --> 00:48.798
I'm not talking to you!

00:48.882 --> 00:49.799
Knock it off, okay?

00:49.883 --> 00:50.842
I'm not having
a discussion with you about it.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.094
DANNY:
Well, you're the one
that came down here,

00:53.178 --> 00:54.012
started the discussion.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.305
We're trying to do our jobs.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.974
Just saying do it by the book,

00:58.057 --> 01:00.018
and we won't have a problem.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.228
But now I do have
a problem-- you.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.940
You, too.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.571
Hey...

01:09.778 --> 01:11.571
JAMIE:
Robles?

01:11.654 --> 01:13.490
You're now riding
with Miller, okay?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.492
Officer Janko,
Officer Witten.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.993
I need you to respond
to the M.E.'s office.

01:17.076 --> 01:18.119
Got a frequent flyer,

01:18.203 --> 01:19.287
threatening
to burn the place down.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.497
An EDP?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.207
Well, they misplaced her
father's body.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.626
So what's
the complaint?

01:24.709 --> 01:26.336
She's threatening the employees.
Threw a boot at one of them

01:26.419 --> 01:27.253
when they told her
to come back later.

01:27.337 --> 01:30.173
Oh, gee, thanks,
that sounds like a joy.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.382
I'll get the car.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.843
I'll get us
some fresh batteries.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.680
Hey, did you hear that your dad
has a hearing coming up?

01:37.764 --> 01:40.683
His lawyers filed a request
for compassionate release.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.186
"Compassionate release,"
based on what?

01:43.269 --> 01:44.979
He's over 65,
served more than half

01:45.063 --> 01:46.356
his sentence,
has diabetes.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.857
Hey, wait a second.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.651
Why do you know
any of that?

01:49.734 --> 01:51.402
He called last night.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.655
Said that he would love it if
you would come to the hearing.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.532
He called you?

01:53.738 --> 01:55.532
Yeah, said that he thought

01:55.615 --> 01:57.200
he had a better shot
going through me.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.952
That you probably wouldn't
want to talk to him.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.829
He's right,
I don't want to talk to him.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.623
And I do not want
to go to his hearing.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.381
Lastly the mayor said
he knows how busy you are,

02:11.464 --> 02:14.342
and that you won't need
to attend tonight's reception.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.013
"Won't need" or "should not"?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.601
Couldn't say, sir.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.229
If you could say?

02:27.939 --> 02:29.232
I get the impression
he's keeping

02:29.315 --> 02:31.442
police business at arm's length.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.407
Tell me about it.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.408
JIM:
Welcome back

02:38.491 --> 02:39.617
to the Manhattan Morning Show.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.078
We've been speaking with City
Council Speaker Regina Thomas.

02:42.161 --> 02:43.872
Uh, thanks for being
with us today.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.248
My pleasure, Jim.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.292
You mentioned the NYPD

02:47.375 --> 02:50.420
and the decidedly anti-cop
sentiment that has taken hold

02:50.503 --> 02:52.422
as a result
of the widely publicized

02:52.505 --> 02:55.592
police brutality cases
around the country.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.969
You need to listen to this.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.929
Bluefish running
in Sheepshead Bay?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.347
Shush!

03:03.308 --> 03:05.143
REGINA:
But this isn't
about any of that.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.645
This is about taking
legislative action.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.147
And a repurposing

03:09.230 --> 03:11.107
from top to bottom

03:11.190 --> 03:14.319
of the NYPD and their resources.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.362
Okay, well,
that-that brings us back

03:16.446 --> 03:18.615
to the "starting where" part.

03:18.698 --> 03:22.577
So, uh, do we defund or retrain?

03:22.660 --> 03:26.748
REGINA:
To get him to retrain
would be like getting him

03:26.831 --> 03:30.126
to cop to the fact
that there is systemic racism

03:30.209 --> 03:32.587
and oppression
within his ranks...

03:32.670 --> 03:35.131
What's so important that...?

03:32.670 --> 03:35.131
Hush!

03:35.214 --> 03:36.799
REGINA:
...that's geared
towards people of color.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.969
JIM:
Mm-hmm. Okay, so defund, then?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.889
REGINA:
Repurpose.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.102
JIM:
Now, you know there are those

03:48.186 --> 03:51.022
who are gonna say, "Well, who's
gonna respond to my 911 call?"

03:51.105 --> 03:53.149
Not her, you can bet on that.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.149
Hey!

03:53.232 --> 03:54.067
JIM: All right, well,
let's take some calls

03:54.150 --> 03:56.027
for City Council Speaker
Regina Thomas.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.279
Ronnie from Brooklyn.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.948
RONNIE:
Thank you for taking my call.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.950
Last week I witnessed
cops breaking up

04:02.033 --> 04:04.494
a group of kids just
peacefully breakdancing

04:04.577 --> 04:05.495
outside the Barclay--

04:05.578 --> 04:07.330
wailing on them
with nightsticks and Tasers.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.833
At least a couple of them were
bleeding when the cops left.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.335
Is he kidding me?

04:12.418 --> 04:13.461
Quiet.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.922
REGINA: Ronnie, I want
to thank you for your call.

04:16.005 --> 04:21.803
I can't tell you how many
of these calls I get a day.

04:21.886 --> 04:22.845
Too many.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.640
And I'm starting to think
that Commissioner Reagan

04:25.723 --> 04:28.267
and his goon squad

04:28.351 --> 04:31.270
need to step back

04:31.354 --> 04:33.564
and get on the right side
of history for once.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.692
Turn it off.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.444
We're gonna have
to offer a rebuttal.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.990
We'd just be answering the
question, "Are you still beating

04:42.073 --> 04:44.200
your puppy, and if not,
when did you stop?"

04:44.283 --> 04:46.411
You just want to let it stand?

04:46.494 --> 04:49.580
Silence isn't
exactly golden here.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.708
(sighs)

04:51.791 --> 04:53.418
You know something I don't know?

04:53.501 --> 04:55.503
Hardly ever.

04:56.337 --> 04:59.799
That caller sounded like
he was selling something.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.011
He said it was
by the Barclays Center.

05:03.094 --> 05:06.055
I'll check in with the 7-4
and see what's what.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.891
What if it's
what the caller said?

05:08.975 --> 05:12.020
We'll deal with it.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.063
What if it's not?

05:15.606 --> 05:18.359
We'll deal with that, too.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.945
Just don't ask me how right now.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.658
(sighs)

05:25.742 --> 05:27.243
Are you kidding me?
Are you kid...?

05:27.326 --> 05:28.494
I'm not filling out anything!

05:28.578 --> 05:29.996
I told you...

05:30.079 --> 05:32.081
You're trying to get rid of
me and you can go to hell

05:32.165 --> 05:34.125
'cause I ain't moving!

05:32.165 --> 05:34.125
Hey, hey, what seems
to be the problem?

05:34.208 --> 05:35.793
They lost my dad's body!

05:35.877 --> 05:37.336
We didn't lose it.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.336
And I will not

05:37.420 --> 05:39.047
be pushed around.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.047
I told her

05:39.130 --> 05:41.799
she needs to come back,
but she's refusing to leave

05:41.883 --> 05:43.468
and she's upsetting
the other people

05:43.551 --> 05:45.428
that are coming here to identify
their loved ones.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.764
Well, lucky for them they
didn't lose their loved ones!

05:47.847 --> 05:49.599
They have them
identified already!

05:49.682 --> 05:51.100
You can't stay here.
You have to leave.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.310
Make me, pig!

05:52.393 --> 05:53.811
That can be arranged.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.105
Hey, we know you're very upset.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.940
The nursing home
where he lives said he was sent

05:58.024 --> 05:59.442
to St. Benjamin's,
and St. Benjamin's said

05:59.525 --> 06:00.818
he died and they sent him here.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.320
And this bitch here

06:02.403 --> 06:03.613
is telling me
she doesn't know where he is!

06:03.696 --> 06:05.114
First of all,
you got to calm down.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.616
And then you got
to watch your language.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.242
What you gonna do, arrest me?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.452
Pepper spray me?

06:09.535 --> 06:10.953
I'm recording you right now.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.330
This is the third time
we've been called.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.124
Because nobody is listening!

06:15.208 --> 06:17.085
WITTEN:
You've had two warnings already.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.961
So either you leave
right now,

06:19.045 --> 06:20.838
or you're under arrest
for disorderly conduct.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.090
Screw you!

06:22.173 --> 06:23.257
Phone down, let's go.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.509
Turn around,
hands behind your back.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.095
(whimpering)

06:24.592 --> 06:27.095
No. Other hand.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.765
Hey, Wit-Witten, hang on.
Come on.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.479
What's your name?

06:36.562 --> 06:38.439
Anita.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.439
All right.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.524
I'll tell you what,

06:39.607 --> 06:41.901
I'm gonna f-find out what
happened to your dad's body,

06:41.984 --> 06:45.321
but you have got
to leave here right now.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.658
I'll leave.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.786
But you've got one day
before I'm back here.

06:58.709 --> 06:59.627
DANNY:
No, no, no, no,

06:59.710 --> 07:01.671
why is it that
when someone like me

07:01.754 --> 07:04.841
is good at their job, people say
they're difficult to work with?

07:04.924 --> 07:08.136
Well, it's why we're here
right now, isn't it?

07:08.219 --> 07:10.680
Because you decided
to follow a lead

07:10.763 --> 07:11.848
without consulting
me first

07:11.931 --> 07:13.975
and before we've
notified next of kin.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.685
Okay, it's a lead.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.186
I mean, that's
why you follow it.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.188
You got to strike
while the iron is hot.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.357
Hotheaded is more like it.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.860
Very funny.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.528
Detectives Reagan

07:25.611 --> 07:27.029
and Baez.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.531
Did something happen?

07:28.614 --> 07:29.866
No, ma'am, actually
we're wondering if you

07:29.949 --> 07:31.367
could, uh, answer
some questions

07:31.450 --> 07:32.493
about a case
we're working.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.163
Do you recognize
this young woman?

07:35.246 --> 07:36.706
Madeline Gleason?

07:36.789 --> 07:38.541
No, should I?

07:38.624 --> 07:40.877
We have reason to believe
she may have visited or been

07:40.960 --> 07:42.712
in contact with
someone in this home

07:42.795 --> 07:44.380
at some point
within the past few days.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.174
I don't recognize her, sorry.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.550
You live here alone?

07:47.633 --> 07:49.385
No, my son Harold
lives with me,

07:49.468 --> 07:50.678
but he's not here right now.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.181
He didn't come
home yesterday.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.224
And he didn't call
or tell you where he was?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.727
He's been acting kind
of strange lately.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.895
Strange how?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.605
I don't know, just spending

08:00.688 --> 08:02.190
a lot of time in the basement.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.567
Do you mind if we take
a look around inside?

08:04.650 --> 08:06.569
Okay, I guess.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.696
Excuse me.
(clears throat)

08:10.990 --> 08:13.367
The door to the basement
is down the hallway.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.702
Right over here?

08:13.451 --> 08:14.702
Yeah.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.828
I'll take a look.

08:17.788 --> 08:18.873
ROBERTS:
You don't think something

08:18.956 --> 08:20.082
could've happened to Harold,
do you?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.918
No, does he often
disappear like this?

08:22.001 --> 08:23.002
No, not often.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.754
He hasn't disappeared
like this since last summer.

08:24.837 --> 08:25.671
Oh.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.265
Can I get you guys anything?
Cup of coffee?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.392
No, we're good, thanks.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.273
Did you find anything?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.691
What?

08:46.859 --> 08:49.111
(grunting)

08:49.195 --> 08:50.863
Baez!

08:52.865 --> 08:55.910
♪ ♪

09:15.054 --> 09:16.097
You okay?
What the hell happened?

09:16.180 --> 09:17.848
Someone pushed me from behind.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.058
(Baez grunts)

09:17.932 --> 09:19.058
Hold on one second.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.022
Hey, open the door!

09:25.106 --> 09:26.857
(winces)

09:29.735 --> 09:31.362
Okay, it's okay, come here.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.781
Where are you hurt?

09:31.445 --> 09:33.781
My knee.

09:33.864 --> 09:34.907
Just call an 85.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.075
(winces)

09:37.910 --> 09:39.996
Come on! There's no service.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.499
Danny?

09:43.582 --> 09:46.002
Listen, hey, I
have to move you.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.170
No! No!

09:46.085 --> 09:48.170
Somebody comes
through that door,

09:48.254 --> 09:50.673
it's gonna be a
problem for us, okay?

09:50.756 --> 09:52.508
No, Danny, just leave me.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.508
It's okay.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.510
It's gonna hurt,
it's gonna hurt.

09:54.593 --> 09:55.678
Okay?

09:54.593 --> 09:55.678
Slow...

09:55.761 --> 09:56.887
(screams)

09:56.971 --> 09:58.973
(grunting)

10:04.437 --> 10:06.480
I left a message
for Danny and Maria.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.024
Neither one of them
called me back.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.901
(knock at door)

10:10.985 --> 10:14.864
Detective Raines
from Nassau County PD.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.032
Hey, Luke, how
are you doing?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.242
Erin, this is
Luke Raines.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.744
Hi. Erin Reagan.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.245
Luke was one of the best
detectives I've ever

10:21.329 --> 10:23.706
worked with,
until he decided to...

10:23.789 --> 10:25.249
leave for greener pastures
on Long Island.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.209
Yeah, well, it turns out
greener pastures

10:27.293 --> 10:28.377
are not without
skeletons,

10:28.461 --> 10:29.920
which is why I'm here.

10:30.004 --> 10:30.963
What can we do for you?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.506
You had a D.O.A. this morning?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.009
Uh, Madeline Gleason.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.344
I'm handling two homicides
from last summer

10:36.427 --> 10:37.720
with the same M.O. as Gleason.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.431
Victims are early-to-mid 20s,
suffocated with a bag

10:40.514 --> 10:41.682
and found along the shoreline.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.226
So you're thinking
this is a serial killer?

10:45.811 --> 10:47.063
That's what we believe.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.231
Nassau crime lab confirmed
that DNA found

10:49.315 --> 10:51.567
on the victims match, but the
suspect isn't in the system.

10:51.650 --> 10:54.528
Have you talked to, uh,
Detectives Reagan and Baez?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.739
I tried, but neither of them
got back to me.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.742
How many victims?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.742
Two from Long Island,

10:59.825 --> 11:01.410
the victim from this morning,

11:01.494 --> 11:03.621
and possibly
a Nassau County detective.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.374
Possibly a detective?
I don't understand.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.958
She was assigned to the case
before me.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.168
She just went missing.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.379
And you think...

11:11.462 --> 11:13.255
the same suspect is responsible?

11:13.339 --> 11:14.715
We don't know for sure,

11:14.799 --> 11:16.759
but she was investigating
one of the homicides

11:16.842 --> 11:18.344
when she dropped off the radar.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.682
I'm all over it. Let's go, Luke.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.105
(door opens)

11:29.188 --> 11:30.106
(door closes)

11:30.189 --> 11:32.608
Eddie. Hey. Where's your arrest?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.777
Well, she agreed to leave.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.777
Wait, wait, wait.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.113
You agreed to help locate
the body, didn't you?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.782
We are not social
workers, Eddie.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.784
Well, sometimes
it's the same thing.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.078
The M.E.'s office
says she threatened to
burn down the building.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.621
What if she makes good on that
and you could have prevented it?

11:45.704 --> 11:48.290
I will prevent it
by helping her.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.793
Hold on. Call this number.

11:50.876 --> 11:54.130
She's a criminalist
in the M.E.'s office.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.132
She always helps me out.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.174
She cute?

11:57.258 --> 11:58.634
She's 60.

11:58.717 --> 11:59.969
Well, I'm gonna be 60 someday.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.304
And I'll still have
the hots for you.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.892
Hey, are you okay?
You seem a little distracted.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.436
(sighs)
Erin called.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.646
Danny and Baez haven't responded
to their radios

12:10.729 --> 12:12.648
or their phones
since this morning.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.985
Well, hey, I'm sure they
just got wrapped up in a case.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.278
Yeah. I'm sure you're right.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.821
I'll call you soon as I hear.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.489
Go find your dead body.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.908
Okay. Thanks.

12:23.909 --> 12:24.827
Hey.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.370
Hey, Loo.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.038
I'm about to take
that lost time.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.336
The C.O. of the 7-4 said
it didn't happen.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.173
None of it?

12:37.256 --> 12:40.342
Two radio cars responded
to excessive noise complaints.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.011
They issued warnings.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.096
Not even a summons?

12:45.389 --> 12:46.474
Boss,

12:46.557 --> 12:47.683
they just handled it.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.187
You've got that...

12:51.270 --> 12:54.064
look like, "Pick me, pick me."

12:55.441 --> 12:57.818
The morning show invited you
to come on

12:57.902 --> 13:00.362
to respond to Speaker Thomas.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.199
Well, that's very nice of them.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.325
So it's a yes?

13:04.408 --> 13:05.701
That's a no.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.369
Why not?
Give 'em our side.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.873
My gut tells me I'd just be
playing Whac-A-Mole

13:10.956 --> 13:13.918
with the caller,
and I don't want to play that.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.712
She's here.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.547
Who's here?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.132
Speaker Thomas.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.511
Who called who?

13:23.594 --> 13:25.804
Hey. She called us.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.556
Let's have her.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.686
Okay, Frank, uh...

13:32.770 --> 13:35.022
please be careful.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.358
Okay, I will
carefully ascertain

13:37.441 --> 13:39.693
whether I need to build
a fire, start a fire,

13:39.777 --> 13:42.071
or put a fire out, okay?

13:42.154 --> 13:43.405
(door opens)

13:45.491 --> 13:49.036
Nice to see you,
Madam Speaker.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.997
Thank you.
Nice to see you, Garrett.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.125
Sid.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.759
Please have a seat.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.759
Thank you.

14:03.842 --> 14:08.389
Listen, I... may have gone
a little overboard today.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.848
I don't want you
to think I'm trying

14:09.932 --> 14:11.267
to start a fight with you.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.602
Hey, we're good.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.062
We are?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.062
Yeah.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.064
The truth is,
I enjoy fighting with you.

14:17.147 --> 14:20.442
But, Regina, what exactly
are we fighting about this time?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.945
About--
and you're not gonna like this--

14:23.028 --> 14:25.573
the NYPD being on trial.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.284
Well, because you're
putting it on trial.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.328
And, by the way,
everyone is entitled

14:31.412 --> 14:34.623
to a vigorous defense,
even my people.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.628
Do you really not see
what's going on here?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.589
I do.

14:41.672 --> 14:45.259
Every single cop is being
painted with the same brush.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.260
And when anyone

14:46.343 --> 14:49.138
in my rank and file
conducts themself in a way

14:49.221 --> 14:51.307
that is not worthy
of the uniform,

14:51.390 --> 14:53.517
they get dealt with.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.517
(tapping desktop)

14:53.601 --> 14:57.271
Every cop is wearing
the same uniform,

14:57.354 --> 14:59.815
so if you get stopped
walking while Black,

14:59.898 --> 15:02.693
how do you know which one
is walking up on you?

15:02.776 --> 15:05.988
Okay, how's a cop to know
what he's walking up on?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.866
See, that fuse gets lit
both ways.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.160
At least we can agree on that.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.162
I need you
to get your cops in check.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.331
Fine, as long as we can keep
the criminals in check.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.832
You got a way to do both?

15:16.915 --> 15:19.877
You have criminals
in your ranks.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.508
Boy...

15:24.256 --> 15:26.508
(taps desktop)

15:26.592 --> 15:30.304
Regina, you need to get
your head out of your ass.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.139
Don't talk to me like that.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.559
Okay.
(sighs)

15:35.643 --> 15:37.895
Look, that caller set you up.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.688
It never happened.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.857
According to your officers.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.692
Okay, give me evidence
otherwise,

15:43.776 --> 15:45.527
and I'm all over it.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.530
I need you and your people

15:48.614 --> 15:50.866
to stand down.

15:50.949 --> 15:54.495
Me and my people
are paid to stand up.

15:54.578 --> 15:58.749
Yes, well, you, then,
need to stand up for everyone.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.463
There are no fences left
to sit on.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.843
(door opens)

16:09.927 --> 16:12.554
(door closes)

16:12.638 --> 16:15.057
(sighs heavily):
I don't know.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.517
(door opens)

16:18.644 --> 16:20.562
So, how'd it go?

16:20.646 --> 16:23.357
(door closes)

16:23.440 --> 16:25.984
Not my finest hour.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.074
I'm gonna take
your gun, okay?

16:29.863 --> 16:32.074
(crying): Okay.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.410
I'm gonna put it right here.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.079
Anybody comes through that door
and doesn't identify themself,

16:37.162 --> 16:38.622
you put one in 'em, okay?

16:38.706 --> 16:40.249
See if we can get
out of here.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.249
(groans)

16:40.332 --> 16:42.209
Did you tell the boss where
we were going before we left?

16:42.292 --> 16:45.462
No. Did you tell the boss where
we were going before we left?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.256
No, because you usually do that.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.757
You think this is my fault?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.634
No, I don't think
it's your fault.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.594
I turned my back for one second.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.138
I-I didn't say
it was your fault.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.181
I knew we should have tracked
her family down first,

16:56.265 --> 16:57.182
but you insisted...

16:57.266 --> 16:59.309
Hey. Listen to me.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.309
(groans)

16:59.393 --> 17:02.771
I'm gonna get us
out of here, okay?
I promise.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.274
Right. Yeah,
you always say that.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.317
And I always do.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.610
Okay?

17:09.737 --> 17:10.863
Look,

17:10.946 --> 17:14.116
neither one of us knew this
was gonna happen, all right?

17:14.199 --> 17:15.451
(gasps softly)

17:16.827 --> 17:19.163
(sniffles, sobs)

17:19.246 --> 17:21.749
Why are you so mad at me?

17:19.246 --> 17:21.749
Why?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.500
Are you kidding me?

17:23.584 --> 17:24.501
You get mad

17:24.585 --> 17:27.421
whenever anyone questions you
or doubts you,

17:27.504 --> 17:28.922
like with Erin this morning.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.924
You're mad at me
because of my sister?

17:31.008 --> 17:32.634
No, I'm not mad. I'm...

17:32.718 --> 17:34.052
I'm hurt.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.263
I'm in pain. I'm scared
that something terrible

17:36.346 --> 17:39.016
is gonna happen to me,
and I'm never gonna get to do

17:39.099 --> 17:41.101
the things that I want to do,

17:41.185 --> 17:43.937
the-the things that you seem
to take for granted.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.648
And what would I take
for granted?

17:44.021 --> 17:46.648
Like...

17:46.732 --> 17:49.651
that's what I was thinking about
when I watched you with Erin

17:49.735 --> 17:50.652
this morning.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.781
You know, you just have
this perfect family,

17:53.864 --> 17:54.990
and you don't
even realize it

17:55.073 --> 17:56.617
half the time.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.119
My family's far from perfect.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.119
Yeah, well,

17:59.203 --> 18:00.871
they're there for you,
and they love you.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.164
That's pretty perfect.

18:02.247 --> 18:07.461
I honestly wish I could trade
places with you right now, I do.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.506
I guess that Reagan luck
never runs out, huh?

18:11.465 --> 18:13.550
It ran out on Linda.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.052
And it ran out

18:15.135 --> 18:18.388
on my brother Joe, so I guess
it does happen sometimes.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.516
I'm gonna get us
the hell out of here.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.900
What?
Did you find something?

18:29.983 --> 18:31.652
DANNY:
No.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.574
I didn't find anything at all.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.827
(Baez sobs, sniffles)

18:46.375 --> 18:48.210
♪ ♪

18:57.719 --> 18:59.930
If you don't like the answers
you're getting,

19:00.013 --> 19:02.099
check your premises.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.144
Which ones?

19:06.228 --> 19:08.188
That cops are part
of the problem

19:08.272 --> 19:10.190
and not part of the solution.

19:10.274 --> 19:13.402
Frank, good cops
can be part of the solution.

19:13.485 --> 19:17.447
But when you have a bad cop,
it would be nice if you

19:17.531 --> 19:19.408
could step out,
or someone like
you step out,

19:19.491 --> 19:22.661
and say, "Hey, this is not great
behavior from our department."

19:22.744 --> 19:25.539
I don't shy away
from doing that.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.539
Well, you know,

19:25.622 --> 19:28.250
a little empathy
could go a long way

19:28.333 --> 19:30.335
to help things deescalate.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.421
On both sides.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.550
Uh, Regina...

19:36.633 --> 19:40.929
I came here to try to rewind
and start over.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.765
We've always had
a pretty good relationship.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.309
Yeah, it's a transactional one,

19:45.392 --> 19:46.727
but, I mean,
it's nothing personal.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.270
Okay, have it your way.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.646
It's not my way; it's a fact.

19:51.231 --> 19:55.944
The fact is, this city
is dividing into two camps

19:56.028 --> 19:58.071
who are just shouting
past each other.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.364
Frank,

19:59.448 --> 20:03.118
you've got to get your guys
to deescalate.

20:03.201 --> 20:05.913
I think you do, too.

20:03.201 --> 20:05.913
Really?

20:05.996 --> 20:08.999
Just 'cause you say something
doesn't make it so.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.959
Tell me you're not pretending
you don't know

20:11.043 --> 20:12.628
that your guys step
over the line.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.256
I have a well-documented history
of firing the ones who do.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.718
Well, you should share that
with people of color.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.848
I don't... think
they're gonna listen to me.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.852
Well, they're not
gonna listen to me,

20:28.936 --> 20:31.480
'cause I always take up
your side.

20:33.899 --> 20:38.528
The only time
I can get your attention

20:38.612 --> 20:41.907
is if I'm screaming at you

20:41.990 --> 20:44.409
or screaming about your cops.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.000
You're so sure of your sight.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.711
Your heroes and villains are...

20:54.795 --> 20:56.797
so clear to you.

20:58.924 --> 20:59.967
(sighs)

21:00.050 --> 21:03.845
Well, God save us from
your vision if you're right.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.852
(sighs)

21:10.936 --> 21:13.230
JAMIE:
TARU located
Danny's vehicle.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.523
Unfortunately they left
the radio in the car.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.692
Maybe they hopped out
to interview a witness

21:16.775 --> 21:19.194
or to follow up on a lead.
Who knows?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.196
All right, hey, listen, we're
doing a door-to-door search.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.698
Okay? Two blocks
in every direction,

21:22.781 --> 21:23.865
log every address we hit.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.075
Let's go.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.075
OFFICER:
You got it, Sarge.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.076
JOE:
Jamie.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.119
OFFICER 2:
You heard him.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.328
Let's go, let's go.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.043
Hey.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.628
What are you doing here?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.628
Hopefully
getting a chance

21:36.712 --> 21:37.838
to help look.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.090
Yeah, we can add one more.
That'd be great.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.467
Uh, Anthony,
this is Joe Hill.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.927
He's my, um...

21:42.551 --> 21:43.927
Family friend.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.220
I'm not looking
to be on the clock.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.555
Just want to help out.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.391
Anthony Abetemarco.
I work with Erin.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.684
She told me about you.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.270
I'm a, uh, family friend, too.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.398
Let's hit it.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.989
(indistinct chatter)

22:07.701 --> 22:09.286
Well?

22:09.369 --> 22:11.371
He's in there.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.422
(door opens)

22:20.505 --> 22:21.923
Let's hear it.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.178
Short and sweet, like you asked.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.556
"To: Mayor Peter H. Chase..."

22:29.639 --> 22:31.266
I know that part.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.480
"Dear Mayor Chase,
please accept this letter

22:36.563 --> 22:38.815
"as notice of my resignation

22:38.899 --> 22:40.901
"as commissioner of the
New York Police Department,

22:40.984 --> 22:43.987
"effective at noon on the
last Friday of this month.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.491
Sincerely, Francis X. Reagan."

22:53.121 --> 22:54.289
"P.S...."

22:55.165 --> 22:57.834
Resignation letters
don't have a P.S.

22:57.918 --> 22:58.960
This one does.

23:01.379 --> 23:04.966
"I take this action
with a heavy heart

23:05.050 --> 23:07.928
"and a full measure of regret.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.764
"It has always been clear
to me that the person

23:10.847 --> 23:12.265
"holding this
office must protect

23:12.349 --> 23:16.978
"our citizens and,
with the same vigilance,

23:17.062 --> 23:19.648
the men and women
of this department."

23:23.026 --> 23:27.656
"But lately... that has become
an impossible balancing act.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.908
To serve one is
to betray the other."

23:31.910 --> 23:33.829
"In regret,

23:33.912 --> 23:36.164
"I have always held
that a willingness to speak

23:36.248 --> 23:38.667
"the unpopular
or inconvenient truth

23:38.750 --> 23:41.503
was essential
to effective leadership."

23:43.213 --> 23:44.965
"This city,

23:45.048 --> 23:49.052
and especially this department,
deserve no less."

24:03.358 --> 24:04.526
Garrett?

24:12.951 --> 24:14.995
Thank you.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.249
My pleasure.

24:22.502 --> 24:26.715
The truth is,
I didn't log in our location

24:26.798 --> 24:30.010
because I was... distracted.

24:30.093 --> 24:33.346
I just, I just kept
thinking about that girl.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.639
The vic?

24:34.723 --> 24:39.186
No, the-the 25-year-old me,

24:39.269 --> 24:42.606
living in Alphabet City
with the musclehead boyfriend.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.608
What about her?

24:44.691 --> 24:48.236
She was promoted to detective
third grade that year.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.407
And, and musclehead
didn't show up.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.868
No one from my family
showed up.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.914
I'm sorry.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.293
I-I didn't realize.

25:03.376 --> 25:06.796
It doesn't matter.
(sniffles)

25:07.839 --> 25:10.675
(door creaking)

25:10.759 --> 25:12.093
(door closes)

25:36.660 --> 25:38.870
(indistinct chatter)

25:40.205 --> 25:41.623
The landlady said
I'd find you here.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.375
She should mind
her own business.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.420
Do you mind if I sit?

25:47.504 --> 25:49.047
It's a free country.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.304
This is a nice place
to hang out.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.639
Been coming here
since I was a kid.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.308
That's Hell's Gate Bridge.

26:00.392 --> 26:05.272
I remember asking my dad why
we lived near the gates of hell.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.649
He said they're also
the gates out of hell.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.610
We located your dad's body.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.822
It's about time.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.822
Someone in the
M.E.'s office

26:13.905 --> 26:16.449
had switched his first name
with his last name,

26:16.533 --> 26:18.660
and that's why they were having
trouble finding his records.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.996
Someone's gonna pay
for that mistake.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.455
It was an innocent mistake.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.542
There are no innocent mistakes.
So, where is he?

26:25.625 --> 26:27.627
He's buried in potter's field

26:27.711 --> 26:28.795
on Hart's Island.

26:28.878 --> 26:30.046
That is where
they bury people

26:30.130 --> 26:31.464
when they're unclaimed.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.342
People no one cares about,
people with no family,

26:34.426 --> 26:36.136
people you just want
to sweep under the rug.

26:36.219 --> 26:39.014
You need to understand that
at the time of your dad's death,

26:39.097 --> 26:40.974
there were hundreds
of deaths a day.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.517
I want him moved.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.185
But I want to see
where he's buried first.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.187
Well, I'm not sure that they're
taking visitors right now.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.897
They can put your loved one
in a mass grave

26:47.981 --> 26:51.568
without telling you,
but you can't go visit?

26:54.779 --> 26:56.448
I'll find out.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.994
Can't let you fall asleep, okay?
You hit your head.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.329
Got to keep you awake.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.748
I'm trying.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.748
I know.

27:08.126 --> 27:11.046
You know, when I was
younger, I was, um...

27:12.797 --> 27:15.759
...I was the jokester
in my family.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.053
I would never think
of you like that.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.181
After my brother died, I...

27:24.225 --> 27:28.146
...I made a promise that I'd
never let my guard down again.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.066
Always be first
in and last out.

27:31.149 --> 27:35.028
Somehow that's led to me
being known as a hothead.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.700
Costed me every partner
I've ever had.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.245
Except you.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.873
I love you, Danny.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.544
(quietly):
I love you, too.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.221
(knocking on door)

28:01.304 --> 28:03.556
(doorbell rings)

28:05.058 --> 28:06.518
Hey!

28:08.520 --> 28:10.105
Hey!

28:08.520 --> 28:10.105
(music playing)

28:10.188 --> 28:11.773
(clanging and music continue)

28:11.856 --> 28:13.274
JAMIE:
Hi, I'm Sergeant Reagan

28:13.358 --> 28:14.275
and this is Detective Hill.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.069
Hey!

28:16.152 --> 28:17.070
Can we ask you some questions?

28:17.153 --> 28:18.655
Sure.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.573
Down here!

28:20.657 --> 28:22.700
Have you seen
either of these two people?

28:24.702 --> 28:26.079
No. Sorry.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.748
How about, uh, this woman?

28:28.832 --> 28:30.125
No.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.751
Did something happen to them?

28:31.835 --> 28:33.128
They're missing.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.587
You heard or seen

28:34.671 --> 28:35.964
anything unusual?

28:36.047 --> 28:39.592
Nothing I'm not used to,
but I'll keep an eye out.

28:47.725 --> 28:49.102
Any word?

28:50.228 --> 28:51.438
No.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.651
Brought you coffee.

28:56.734 --> 28:58.945
Thank you.

28:59.028 --> 29:01.448
You'd be
the first call I'd make.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.870
Right. How you holding up?

29:06.953 --> 29:09.664
Me?

29:09.747 --> 29:12.167
My challenge these days
is figuring out

29:12.250 --> 29:14.294
which fire to put out first.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.214
Anything I can do?

29:18.298 --> 29:21.634
No, I'm good.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.304
Liar.

29:25.763 --> 29:26.848
(chuckles)

29:26.931 --> 29:30.518
You never buy my poker face.
How's that?

29:30.602 --> 29:32.520
Mom taught me well.

29:32.604 --> 29:37.484
Yeah, well, she also left me
the owner's manual for you.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.569
What's on your mind?

29:40.945 --> 29:43.823
Who said anything
was on my mind?

29:44.824 --> 29:47.202
Long way to come for coffee.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.663
We had words.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.375
And not just "good morning"?

29:54.459 --> 29:56.211
Well, I saw him
at a crime scene

29:56.294 --> 29:57.587
and I said something
that triggered him,

29:57.670 --> 29:59.714
and the next thing you knew,

29:59.797 --> 30:01.925
we were just going at each other
for no reason.

30:02.008 --> 30:05.512
So? You guys battle
all the time.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.263
You always work it out.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.893
But what if I can't this time?

30:11.976 --> 30:14.395
What if my last words
were just...?

30:17.941 --> 30:21.569
Erin, if it turned out
your last words to me

30:21.653 --> 30:25.073
were "Dad, you're
so full of crap,"

30:25.156 --> 30:29.285
do you really think my last
thought of you would be,

30:29.369 --> 30:32.205
"For 109 years,
she thought I was full of crap?"

30:32.288 --> 30:34.249
109 years?

30:34.332 --> 30:37.585
Eh, that's the plan.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.587
Clean living.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.173
You are full of crap.

30:42.257 --> 30:45.218
Well, I am and I'm not.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.887
He knows you love and respect
and value him.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.139
No string of words
is gonna change that.

30:52.141 --> 30:57.480
And... there's no sense
in rehearsing a tragedy.

31:02.026 --> 31:05.238
And, look, it's Danny.

31:05.321 --> 31:08.116
He's a slippery one.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.827
So let's put our money on him.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.581
Okay?

31:23.548 --> 31:25.300
We got a whole team
of detectives,

31:25.383 --> 31:26.676
and I'll call you
as soon as we have them.

31:26.759 --> 31:27.844
We're very close.

31:27.927 --> 31:30.305
No, don't come in.
Okay.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.514
Love you, too.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.267
You're not a great liar.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.102
Probably why I'm a cop
and not a lawyer.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.323
I really looked up to him.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.825
Guess that's a perk
of having siblings.

31:50.908 --> 31:53.161
It's kind of weird
because you remind me of him.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.288
I don't know
the first thing about him.

31:56.247 --> 31:58.207
He had a wicked sense of humor.

31:58.291 --> 32:01.127
And he was a adrenaline
junkie. He loved motorcycles,

32:01.210 --> 32:04.213
Jet Skis, roller coasters.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.884
This must be tough for you.

32:10.595 --> 32:14.223
I keep thinking that,
uh, it's unusual

32:14.307 --> 32:16.017
that Danny would leave
a crime scene in such a hurry.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.019
Yeah. Uh...

32:18.102 --> 32:19.562
It must be something important

32:19.646 --> 32:21.606
if he didn't have time
to phone it in. Yeah.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.566
Lieutenant.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.026
Uh, where are we at

32:25.109 --> 32:27.195
on talking to the two witnesses?

32:25.109 --> 32:27.195
GEE: I talked to the
victim's girlfriend.

32:27.278 --> 32:30.198
The vic was talking to a guy
at the bar most of the night.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.407
We're looking through
the security footage now

32:31.491 --> 32:32.992
to see if we can get

32:33.076 --> 32:34.494
a screen grab.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.494
JAMIE:
Didn't the uniform
at the scene

32:34.577 --> 32:35.703
say that there was a pocketbook?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.664
Yeah. We took a voucher
for evidence.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.040
Can I see the case file?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.708
I want to take a look
at the contents of the bag.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.001
What are you looking for?

32:42.085 --> 32:44.003
I just figure if, uh,
the vic was talking

32:44.087 --> 32:46.381
to a guy at the bar all night,
then maybe he gave her

32:46.464 --> 32:48.549
a phone number or a
business card. The address

32:48.633 --> 32:50.885
on this one's 9208 156th Avenue.

32:50.968 --> 32:53.721
Where the car is.

32:50.968 --> 32:53.721
Exactly. Check it out?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.348
Yeah, let's go.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.693
Hey. Police! Open up!

33:08.653 --> 33:10.530
Anybody home?

33:11.989 --> 33:13.116
Anybody home?

33:13.199 --> 33:14.409
Police!

33:14.492 --> 33:17.245
Ma'am? Hey, you okay?

33:17.328 --> 33:19.664
There's a woman right there.
She's just not responding.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.124
(clanging in distance)

33:21.207 --> 33:23.167
Hey, Joe, listen.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.795
You hear that?

33:25.878 --> 33:27.588
DANNY:
Hey!

33:27.672 --> 33:28.923
Get on the air.
Have ESU respond.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.717
5-4 task force detective

33:30.800 --> 33:32.927
requesting ESU respond
to this location.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.476
Police! Anybody here?

33:40.560 --> 33:43.104
Police!

33:43.187 --> 33:45.273
Danny?

33:43.187 --> 33:45.273
Danny!

33:45.356 --> 33:48.276
Police!

33:45.356 --> 33:48.276
Joe.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.403
Ma'am, police.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.657
5-4 task force detective.

33:54.741 --> 33:57.076
10-13 at this location.

33:58.035 --> 33:59.746
Down here!

34:00.705 --> 34:02.123
(clanging continues)

34:00.705 --> 34:02.123
Hey!

34:02.206 --> 34:03.291
Danny?

34:03.374 --> 34:05.501
Danny!

34:08.963 --> 34:10.673
Danny!

34:08.963 --> 34:10.673
(clanging continues)

34:10.757 --> 34:12.842
Hey, Danny!

34:10.757 --> 34:12.842
Danny, is that you?

34:12.925 --> 34:14.385
Hey!

34:15.720 --> 34:17.388
Hey! I hear him.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.769
Stand back.
I'm opening this door.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.690
Danny!

34:30.234 --> 34:31.694
Danny, you all right?
You guys all right?

34:31.778 --> 34:33.279
She needs a bus.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.947
(Baez grunts)

34:33.362 --> 34:34.947
EMTs!

34:35.031 --> 34:36.991
Hey, EMT! Down here, downstairs.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.326
Come on!

34:40.036 --> 34:42.163
Hey, you all right?

34:42.246 --> 34:44.582
Is she all right?
Are you okay?

34:42.246 --> 34:44.582
Yeah.

34:44.665 --> 34:46.584
You all right?

34:44.665 --> 34:46.584
Yeah.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.350
(sighs)

35:02.433 --> 35:04.310
(siren wailing)

35:04.393 --> 35:05.436
Hey.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.773
Some people will do anything
to get some time off, huh?

35:08.856 --> 35:11.150
Good to see you, too.
How's my sister?

35:11.234 --> 35:13.361
Well, she's a Reagan,
so, thanks to you,

35:13.444 --> 35:16.572
the last 24 hours has been
a living hell for me.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.491
Well, there's
one positive in all this.

35:18.574 --> 35:19.867
JAMIE: Hey.

35:18.574 --> 35:19.867
You talk to the M.E.?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.702
Yeah. The homeowner
Susan Roberts--

35:21.786 --> 35:22.703
looks like she was suffocated.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.747
M.E. says she was killed
about three hours ago.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.208
Great. You know,
we got a serial killer here.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.585
I saw the photos.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.585
ABETEMARCO:
Yeah,

35:29.669 --> 35:31.921
and Nassau County's got a
couple of similar vics, too.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.048
Great.
We got to go through that place

35:34.132 --> 35:35.258
with a fine-tooth comb, okay?

35:35.341 --> 35:36.759
I want to get
this son of a bitch.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.302
Yeah.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.224
Hey.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.224
Hey. Glad you're okay.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.767
Thank you.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.060
I-I got to go see

35:46.143 --> 35:48.062
Baez at the hospital,
all right?

35:48.145 --> 35:50.106
Make sure
this gets done right.

35:50.189 --> 35:51.566
Don't worry. I'm on it.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.234
Come on, I'll drive you.

35:53.317 --> 35:56.404
Hey, we're locking the house
down, all right? I don't want

35:56.487 --> 35:58.364
anybody in there
who doesn't need to be, okay?

35:56.487 --> 35:58.364
Yes, sir.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.825
Hey, Joe, uh,
you want to help at the scene?

36:00.908 --> 36:03.244
No, I think
I should get back to my team.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.788
Yeah. Right, okay.
Thanks for your help.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.248
You got it. Yeah.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.749
Hey, Joe. Uh...

36:10.334 --> 36:12.461
You coming to family dinner
on Sunday?

36:12.545 --> 36:15.423
I can't. I have plans.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.924
Thank you.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.218
Okay. I'll see you.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.062
JIM:
I haven't seen this long a queue

36:30.146 --> 36:31.606
of listeners
calling in since...

36:31.689 --> 36:33.941
I don't know when.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.527
I hope you're ready,
Commissioner.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.907
Well, Jim, you give
the people what they want,

36:40.990 --> 36:42.575
and they come out for it.

36:42.658 --> 36:45.953
So, bring on the pitchforks
and torches.

36:46.037 --> 36:49.332
REGINA:
You're gonna be fine.

36:49.415 --> 36:52.460
It's a good thing
we're on the radio.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.965
Thank you, Regina.
That's very reassuring.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.636
Muriel from Queens,
you're on the air.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.262
MURIEL:
What plans do you have

37:03.346 --> 37:05.139
to earn back
the community trust

37:05.222 --> 37:06.599
of police officers?

37:06.682 --> 37:07.934
What am I supposed to say
to my children

37:08.017 --> 37:09.101
when they see those videos?

37:09.185 --> 37:10.311
How am I supposed to tell...?

37:10.394 --> 37:13.439
I heard they use prisoners
to dig these big, mass graves

37:13.522 --> 37:15.608
'cause it's okay to take
advantage of poor people.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.777
City thinks it can do that
'cause they don't have to answer

37:17.860 --> 37:19.987
to anybody, but they'll
be answering to me.

37:20.071 --> 37:24.408
330.
This would be the spot.

37:38.547 --> 37:41.384
You know, I really am sorry

37:41.467 --> 37:43.344
for your loss.

37:45.388 --> 37:48.307
Last time I saw
my dad, we fought.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.142
I told him I was
dropping out of college

37:50.226 --> 37:51.978
to move to Florida
with my boyfriend.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.146
He said, "He's a loser,

37:54.230 --> 37:56.315
and he's gonna drag you down."

37:57.316 --> 37:59.026
Yeah, Dad, you were right.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.028
I know

38:01.112 --> 38:02.822
I didn't listen to you.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.993
He loved the water.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.870
He'd like looking
over at Manhattan.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.497
It's the only time in his life

38:11.580 --> 38:13.040
he could afford
this kind of view.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.001
Really is pretty.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.669
But growing up,

38:16.752 --> 38:18.838
my dad always coached
my basketball team,

38:18.921 --> 38:22.925
and he'd say a prayer
before every game.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.181
Dear God,

38:29.265 --> 38:32.393
today is game day,
and I place myself

38:32.476 --> 38:34.186
in your loving hands.

38:37.481 --> 38:40.526
(crying):
Help me to be a good sport.

38:43.154 --> 38:47.742
I pray that I don't
seek individual glory

38:47.825 --> 38:50.077
or accolades

38:50.161 --> 38:52.580
but that I play
for your glory

38:52.663 --> 38:54.999
and for the good
of my team.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.544
Amen.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.588
Amen.

39:00.671 --> 39:03.466
He never missed a game.

39:06.010 --> 39:10.056
That really is a nice prayer.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.558
Thank you.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.769
For everything.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.313
You're welcome.

39:17.396 --> 39:21.609
Um, I'm gonna give you
some time alone, okay?

39:21.692 --> 39:23.694
♪ ♪

39:42.088 --> 39:45.341
Hi. This is Eddie Janko.

39:45.424 --> 39:48.219
Could you get a message
to my dad

39:48.302 --> 39:51.305
that I will be at his hearing?

39:53.307 --> 39:54.975
Thanks.

40:17.414 --> 40:19.625
Caesar salad,
as requested by Pops.

40:19.708 --> 40:21.293
Yeah.

40:19.708 --> 40:21.293
HENRY:
I also requested

40:21.377 --> 40:23.838
deep-fried Oreo cookies.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.838
(all chuckle)

40:23.921 --> 40:26.132
I don't see them
anywhere on the table.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.383
No.

40:27.466 --> 40:28.676
(Frank and Erin chuckle)

40:28.759 --> 40:29.969
Hey.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.846
Hey!

40:30.052 --> 40:31.846
HENRY:
Hey.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.806
Here they are.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.806
Hey, you made it.

40:33.889 --> 40:36.475
You guys all remember
my partner Maria Baez.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.476
Sure.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.353
Hey, Maria.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.353
Welcome.

40:39.436 --> 40:40.729
Thank you, Commissioner.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.857
Uh, Frank at this table, please.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.024
(chuckles)

40:44.108 --> 40:45.734
Hey, Maria. How
you feeling?

40:45.818 --> 40:47.027
A little better every day.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.320
Well, you deserve
a medal, you ask me.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.739
Oh, no. It's nothing serious.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.908
Well, not for the boo-boo,
for partnering with my brother.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.035
(Henry and Frank laugh)

40:52.992 --> 40:55.035
ERIN:
Frankly,

40:55.119 --> 40:56.495
I think you should
collect hazard pay

40:56.579 --> 40:58.164
for putting up
with this one.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.874
Give me a break.
Don't believe her.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.876
I'm sure the whole time we
were locked in that basement,

41:01.959 --> 41:04.003
she was worried out of her
mind and feeling terrible

41:04.086 --> 41:05.379
for being a pain in my ass.

41:05.462 --> 41:07.047
No, I didn't.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.717
Tell the truth. Dad, she
was worried, wasn't she?

41:09.800 --> 41:12.928
Oh, I can neither confirm
nor deny.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.928
DANNY: Mm-hmm.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.890
They're always at it, these two.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.266
ERIN:
I will concede there's

41:17.349 --> 41:19.143
one thing that Danny
is better at than me,

41:19.226 --> 41:20.769
and that is being a pain
in the ass.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.397
Eh.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.397
(all laugh)

41:23.480 --> 41:24.732
Tough crowd.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.734
Oh, we haven't even gotten
to grace yet.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.236
Hey, you're a rookie.
We'll go easy on you.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.573
Well, this all looks so nice.
I can't remember the last time

41:32.656 --> 41:34.575
I was at a Sunday dinner
like this.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.076
SEAN:
I can't remember

41:36.160 --> 41:37.411
the last time I wasn't.

41:37.494 --> 41:39.246
(chuckles)

41:37.494 --> 41:39.246
Oh, God.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.582
Always the wise guy.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.250
Yeah.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.418
(all chuckle)

41:44.501 --> 41:47.087
Thank you for inviting me.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.255
We're the lucky ones.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.590
Yes, we are.

41:49.673 --> 41:51.425
JAMIE: Yeah, not every day
we get to break bread

41:51.509 --> 41:53.260
with the only partner that
Danny's been able to hold on to.

41:53.344 --> 41:56.430
A concept that you two
have taken to a whole new level.

41:56.513 --> 41:58.265
(all chuckle)

41:58.349 --> 42:00.142
Oh, I see being captured
for a day

42:00.226 --> 42:01.936
didn't slow your comebacks time.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.437
That's right.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.064
(Henry and Janko laugh)

42:05.147 --> 42:06.607
Well, I, for one,

42:06.690 --> 42:09.944
am grateful
to have you both with us.

42:11.153 --> 42:12.112
Amen.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.614
SEAN:
I don't know about you guys,

42:13.697 --> 42:15.532
but I am starving.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.532
Mm-hmm.

42:15.616 --> 42:19.286
Well, I kind of thought
Danny might want to say grace.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.248
Okay.
(clears throat)

42:24.708 --> 42:25.960
ALL:
Bless us, oh, Lord,

42:26.043 --> 42:27.962
and these, thy gifts,
which we are

42:28.045 --> 42:29.964
about to receive
from thy bounty.

42:30.047 --> 42:31.632
Through Christ, our Lord, amen.
