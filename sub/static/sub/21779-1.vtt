00:27.061 --> 00:28.138
You're a bastard!

00:28.162 --> 00:30.640
I'm unhappy, we're unhappy...
it's over.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.533
Unbelievable...

00:35.536 --> 00:38.248
After everything
we've been through.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.308
This just isn't working anymore.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.621
And divorce is your answer?

00:44.645 --> 00:47.524
We ve had our problems
for awhile now, Margot.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.050
Your drinking is
just getting worse.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.330
So you d rather throw
your family away

00:53.354 --> 00:55.199
than your precious
glass of wine?

00:55.223 --> 00:56.766
Do you think I m stupid?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.435
I know what this
is really about.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.436
You re drunk.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.628
You re a liar!

01:01.762 --> 01:03.307
Who is she, James?

01:03.331 --> 01:05.666
I don t know who you
re talking about.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.481
It's okay, I know.

01:11.505 --> 01:15.352
I know where you go when you say
you're staying late at work.

01:15.376 --> 01:19.156
Where you go instead of spending
time with your own daughter.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.758
Caroline is pretty.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.793
Whoa, Margot, put it down.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.429
You destroyed our family.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.164
Margot please, you
don't need to do this.

01:27.188 --> 01:27.797
Please!

01:27.821 --> 01:29.233
You destroyed our lives.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.834
Don't do this! Think about Elle!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.302
You destroyed everything!

01:32.326 --> 01:33.661
Margot, Margot!

01:35.596 --> 01:37.498
Mom?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.792
Sorry.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.495
Oh, actually that
color right there

03:38.519 --> 03:40.964
is one of my favorite
colors for a room.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.899
Hopefully it'll be mine too.

03:42.923 --> 03:43.733
And when the sun hits it,

03:43.757 --> 03:46.636
it actually brightens
its intensity.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.938
You seem to know a
lot about paint.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.540
I m studying art at Cornish.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.642
I'm actually taking my
thesis seminar this year.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.645
The only thing I'm painting
these days is my guest house.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.648
I m painting my apartment
because I have to move.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.385
My landlord is renting
it to his daughter.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.852
I have no idea how
I m going to find

04:02.876 --> 04:05.746
an apartment by the
end of the month.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.359
This is kind of wild, but
I'm painting my guest house

04:09.383 --> 04:11.795
because we re looking for a
responsible tenant to rent it.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.897
Are you serious?
Well, that s me.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.665
Okay...

04:15.689 --> 04:18.567
I have someone coming
by the house today,

04:18.591 --> 04:19.969
if you want to stop by.

04:19.993 --> 04:20.970
I would love to.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.439
You're welcome to.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.583
My name is Caroline Winters.

04:23.607 --> 04:24.974
Hi, I'm Elle.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.576
Awesome.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.579
Well Elle, my address is on
there and my phone number

04:29.603 --> 04:31.415
and email, whatever
else you need.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.316
Okay.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.116
Just come by after three.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.419
Sounds great, thank you so much.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.511
I'll see you later.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.868
Even strokes, babe.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.570
Like up and down.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.439
All right c'mon, you
know I m a numbers guy.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.040
Painting s not my thing.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.509
I love the color though.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.612
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.548
Are we making the
right decision?

05:04.572 --> 05:06.916
I really love our privacy.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.819
Well I mean, yeah.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.588
Logan's going to
school this fall,

05:11.612 --> 05:12.722
we'll need the extra money.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.992
It's just a matter of us
finding someone responsible.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.928
How about you finish this
and I'll go make us lunch?

05:18.952 --> 05:20.930
What would I do
without you, huh?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.866
You'd probably have
a better paint job.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.658
Definitely.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.538
I love you!

05:28.562 --> 05:30.564
I love you.

05:35.946 --> 05:36.946
Come in!

05:36.970 --> 05:37.981
Hi, Mrs. Winters.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.907
Hi Kelsi.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.620
Yo!

05:43.644 --> 05:45.121
Yo...

05:45.145 --> 05:47.023
What's this?

05:47.047 --> 05:48.558
It's turkey.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.594
Who's that outside
talking with Mom?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.896
Umm, that's Mandy's
niece, Kelsi.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.732
She's thinking about
renting our guest house.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.916
Are you going to rent out my
room when I go to college?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.636
I don't know, that depends...

05:59.660 --> 06:00.937
On what?

06:00.961 --> 06:03.797
Whether or not you
take out the trash.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.614
You were kidding, right?

06:10.638 --> 06:11.681
About my room?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.707
That's not funny!

06:16.510 --> 06:17.521
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.622
I'm sorry, excuse me.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.590
Really, it was my fault.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.659
Can I help you?

06:22.683 --> 06:24.894
I m here to see the guest house.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.663
Yeah, it's just
around the corner.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.531
It s in the back.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.632
How convenient.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.133
I m Elle.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.067
Logan.

06:31.091 --> 06:31.935
Nice to meet you.

06:31.959 --> 06:32.869
Sweet.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.928
Thanks for your help.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.687
Hi?

06:50.711 --> 06:52.021
Caro? Sorry I m early.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.657
No, that's okay.

06:53.681 --> 06:54.858
Elle, this is Kelsi.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.926
Kelsi, this is Elle.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.562
Hi.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.563
And it's a one bedroom?

06:59.587 --> 07:00.564
It is.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.698
Tell you what?

07:01.722 --> 07:02.666
Why don't you look
around down here,

07:02.690 --> 07:04.410
and I'm going to take
her up to the bedroom.

07:04.434 --> 07:04.968
Sure.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.159
Okay.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.977
Oh wow!

07:14.001 --> 07:16.045
I love what you've
done with the place.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.905
Oh, good.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.306
Come on, I'll show
you the upstairs.

07:20.330 --> 07:21.585
Oh, perfect.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.119
So...

07:23.143 --> 07:24.912
watch your head.

08:01.819 --> 08:03.059
Thank you so much, Mrs. Winters.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.695
It's absolutely perfect.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.897
I'll fill out the application
and get it right to you.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.361
Okay, all right
thanks for coming by.

08:09.385 --> 08:11.153
Thank you!

08:12.202 --> 08:13.202
Bye!

08:13.226 --> 08:14.226
Bye.

08:16.707 --> 08:17.987
Here, I'll show you the bedroom.

08:18.011 --> 08:19.246
Sure.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.712
Wow, it's lovely.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.114
So much natural light, it'd
be perfect for my artwork.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.950
Please send me the application.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.885
I will and I'm gonna have
to do a credit check.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.019
Yeah, no problem.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.243
I'm 21 and I have good credit.

08:31.267 --> 08:32.889
My parents taught me well.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.258
Do they live in the area?

08:35.282 --> 08:37.159
No, actually...

08:37.183 --> 08:38.761
they passed away when I was 12.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.096
Oh, I m sorry.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.832
I can sympathize, I lost
my father in college.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.002
You never really get over it.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.061
No, you don t.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.140
Anybody hungry?

08:51.164 --> 08:53.977
You didn t tell me that the
place came with room service.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.011
This is my husband, Sam.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.915
Sam, this is Elle, she's
checking out the place.

08:56.939 --> 08:57.781
Hi.

08:57.805 --> 08:58.715
Nice to meet you.

08:58.739 --> 08:59.849
You have a lovely home.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.317
Thank you.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.501
It'll be a lot quieter once
our son leaves for college.

09:03.525 --> 09:04.988
Oh yeah, I met Logan
on the way in.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.022
You have a lovely family.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.190
We are blessed.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.158
Well, I will let you
guys finish painting

09:09.182 --> 09:10.927
and I'll get out of your way.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.271
You know, you sent
me your e-mail,

09:12.295 --> 09:14.030
so I'll go ahead and
send the application.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.632
Yeah, perfect.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.300
Thank you again for
this opportunity.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.703
I have a good feeling
about this place.

09:19.727 --> 09:20.303
Bye.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.729
Bye!

09:23.941 --> 09:24.941
She seems nice.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.176
Yeah! She is...

09:27.200 --> 09:29.112
What about your friend s niece?

09:29.136 --> 09:30.714
She was nice too.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.818
I guess we ll have to choose
between the two of them.

09:32.842 --> 09:33.917
Yeah.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.852
You're missing that
whole spot over there.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.821
Where?

09:37.845 --> 09:38.988
Right there, look.

09:39.012 --> 09:39.823
Stop!

09:39.847 --> 09:41.114
No, stop!

10:25.225 --> 10:27.270
Yes hi, I would like to cancel

10:27.294 --> 10:29.797
my credit cards, please.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.844
Yes, the name on
the credit card?

10:34.868 --> 10:36.336
Kelsi Chartrand.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.149
I see you haven t refilled
your prescription.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.285
Shocking.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.320
Your pills make me sick.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.790
We can reduce the dosage
or try another medication,

10:46.814 --> 10:49.783
but you can t just
stop taking it, Elle.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.733
I know this week must
be difficult for you,

10:56.757 --> 10:58.301
having to deal with
the anniversary

10:58.325 --> 11:00.236
of your parents death.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.873
Have you tried visiting
their graves yet?

11:03.897 --> 11:08.377
You know, I m really bored
with this, Dr. Sage.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.047
And I m also tired
of wasting $200/hr

11:11.071 --> 11:14.884
so you can just continue to
ask me stupid questions.

11:14.908 --> 11:18.187
Your court mandated group
therapy isn't helping?

11:18.211 --> 11:20.790
I m bored with that, too.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.326
Elle, you have to work
at this every day.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.386
You know, you learn
something new every day.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.235
My dad had an affair...

11:32.259 --> 11:36.339
he cheated on my mom and wanted
to leave her for another woman.

11:36.363 --> 11:40.309
That s why she killed
him and then herself.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.478
How did you find this out?

11:42.502 --> 11:45.915
My aunt and I found a box of
my mom s things in her attic.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.952
I went through it and
found her diary.

11:48.976 --> 11:52.221
It was brutally honest.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.424
That must have been difficult.

11:55.448 --> 12:00.296
My dad was always my shining
example of perfection...

12:00.320 --> 12:02.298
And now?

12:02.322 --> 12:03.933
When you grow up you realize

12:03.957 --> 12:06.035
that your parents
are just people.

12:06.059 --> 12:10.306
Capable of mistakes,
some horrible mistakes.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.541
But my family was destroyed
and this other woman

12:12.565 --> 12:15.344
got to go back to her life
like nothing ever happened.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.047
And how does this make you feel?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.071
Well, I mean it...

12:20.207 --> 12:22.485
I m sorry, Elle, we
can ignore that.

12:22.509 --> 12:26.155
Look, I m concerned that we
need more time with this.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.115
Perhaps tomorrow?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.544
Caro, hey!

12:48.568 --> 12:50.479
Hey Elle, I was calling
to see if you were

12:50.503 --> 12:52.982
still interested in
renting the guest house?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.350
Absolutely.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.285
I was afraid you d gone
with the other girl,

12:56.309 --> 12:57.987
since she was there first.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.188
Well, it umm...

12:59.212 --> 13:01.157
it didn't really work out.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.159
That's too bad.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.360
Well, I m excited to move in.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.095
When s a good time for
me to sign the lease

13:06.119 --> 13:07.263
and grab the keys?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.364
You could come by
tonight if you wanted.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.266
You could sign the
lease and I guess

13:10.290 --> 13:11.968
you could move in
anytime you want.

13:11.992 --> 13:12.936
Sounds great.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.071
Okay, so I'll see you tonight.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.396
Thanks.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.982
No, no!

13:40.287 --> 13:41.998
Hey, do you need some help?

13:42.022 --> 13:45.168
Hey yeah, that would be great.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.060
No worries.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.573
You can come inside,
I'm not gonna bite.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.953
So are you into
art or something?

14:03.977 --> 14:05.421
I guess you could say that.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.124
I mean, I am taking
my degree at Cornish.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.025
That's cool.

14:09.049 --> 14:12.195
What about you, Logan?
What are you into?

14:12.219 --> 14:15.098
I'm into stuff, y'know.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.466
I like art too, I think
art's really cool.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.168
But yeah...

14:19.192 --> 14:21.404
Well, maybe I can
sketch you sometime.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.239
I m always looking
for my next model.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.263
Logan!

14:26.266 --> 14:27.267
Logan!

14:29.536 --> 14:30.947
Hey, dinner's ready.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.215
Do you want to join us?

14:32.239 --> 14:34.283
Oh no, I don t want to
intrude on family dinner...

14:34.307 --> 14:36.219
Please, we'd love it.

14:36.243 --> 14:36.619
Really?

14:36.643 --> 14:38.487
Yeah, c'mon!

14:38.511 --> 14:40.013
Okay...

14:43.650 --> 14:47.163
Wow, I have not had a home
cooked meal like that

14:47.187 --> 14:48.627
since I lived with
my aunt and uncle.

14:48.651 --> 14:49.698
You don t cook?

14:49.722 --> 14:52.601
Oh I do, it's just I
m usually too busy.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.003
And it's not the
same unless you're

14:54.027 --> 14:55.187
sharing it with other people.

14:55.211 --> 14:56.611
How long ago did you
live with them?

14:56.635 --> 14:58.674
They adopted me after
my parents died

14:58.698 --> 15:01.010
and then I moved
out when I was 18.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.211
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.080
Thank you.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.350
My co-worker s daughter is
studying psychology at Cornish.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.218
It's a top art school.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.119
Good for you!

15:10.143 --> 15:11.620
Thank you, I have
one more year to go

15:11.644 --> 15:13.589
and then we'll see what happens.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.491
Where are you going to school?

15:15.515 --> 15:18.261
I 'm going to Wildon next fall.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.163
Nice, what s your major?

15:20.187 --> 15:21.330
Business.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.400
You can always get a great
job with a business degree.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.237
Just like his old man.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.372
May I be excused?

15:29.396 --> 15:31.516
I have to finish my chemistry
homework if that's cool.

15:31.540 --> 15:32.375
Sure.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.144
You studying alone tonight?

15:35.168 --> 15:37.546
It s complicated, I guess so.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.649
Well, it's better you focus on
your studies right now anyway.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.617
Good night, Elle.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.552
Good night, Logan.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.421
He likes a girl at
school and she likes

15:45.445 --> 15:47.390
a guy on the swim team, so...

15:47.414 --> 15:51.160
He's trying to gain the courage
to ask her to the prom.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.296
Well I'm sure she'll say yes.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.531
He's a good kid.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.266
She will.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.268
Do you mind if I
use your bathroom?

15:59.292 --> 16:03.163
Please, it's just through
the kitchen, to the left.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.671
Thanks again so much for dinner,
I really appreciate it.

16:46.695 --> 16:47.750
Oh anytime.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.153
If you need anything,
just holler.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.255
Actually, I really like to swim.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.522
Do you mind if I use the pool?

16:53.546 --> 16:54.623
No, not at all.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.525
We hardly even use it anymore.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.461
Great, thanks. Good night.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.253
Good night.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.273
I think Elle s going
to be a great tenant.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.874
Yeah, she seems responsible.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.344
I think she had to grow up fast.

17:48.368 --> 17:52.272
She told me she lost her parents
when she was younger...

17:58.645 --> 18:00.623
What s wrong?

18:00.647 --> 18:01.490
My new boss.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.874
He's stressed out
about the account

18:02.898 --> 18:05.635
and he's taking it
out on me again.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.366
Are you going to be able to
take Logan to school tomorrow?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.870
No, I ve got that
meeting first thing.

18:11.894 --> 18:14.403
And I have an early
conference call with London.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.397
Let's deal with it
tomorrow, I'm too tired.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.467
Good night.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.402
Hi, good morning.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.437
I forgot to buy
coffee at the store.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.772
We can t have that, come on in.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.440
I just brewed a pot.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.877
I m nothing without
my morning coffee.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.679
Thank you Mr. Winters.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.813
Please, call me Sam.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.649
Mr. Winters makes me feel old.

19:00.673 --> 19:01.917
You re not old.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.244
That's kind of you to say.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.589
There you go.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.614
Such service.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.594
Good morning.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.461
Morning, Caro.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.896
I was just telling
Sam that I forgot

19:13.920 --> 19:14.863
to buy coffee at the store.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.365
Right.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.829
You had a conference
call didn't you?

19:17.853 --> 19:18.834
I m leaving in five.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.504
Logan, we have to go right
now or we're gonna be late.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.572
I still have to take
a shower, wait!

19:23.596 --> 19:24.956
He s not going to
be ready in time.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.676
I can take Logan to school...

19:27.700 --> 19:28.544
if you want.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.846
No, don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

19:30.870 --> 19:34.550
No really, I'm going to class
anyways, it's no problem.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.484
Okay, okay.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.188
Logan, Elle is going
to take you to school.

19:37.212 --> 19:38.487
I'll see you tonight.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.723
I'm gonna walk out with you.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.591
Have a good day!

19:42.615 --> 19:43.526
Thank you.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.852
Whatever you need in
the fridge is yours.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.674
I m ready.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.844
Sorry, I was just snooping
at your family history.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.446
Oh those?

20:03.470 --> 20:05.581
My mom likes to keep
pictures everywhere.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.984
You guys look so happy,
except for this one.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.678
How old were you there?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.557
Nine.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.726
We were pretty miserable
there actually.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.395
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.496
It's cool.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.598
Do you know why?

20:22.622 --> 20:27.035
No, I mean... I guess they
were their having problems,

20:27.059 --> 20:28.637
or whatever, but...

20:28.661 --> 20:30.861
You re pretty close with your
parents now though, right?

20:30.885 --> 20:32.541
Yeah.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.909
Okay come on, we gotta go.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.010
Let's go, c'mon!

20:35.034 --> 20:36.536
All right!

20:38.438 --> 20:39.739
Thanks.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.813
Hey... you drive.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.958
Wait, seriously?

20:49.982 --> 20:50.926
Come on!

20:50.950 --> 20:52.661
Really?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.430
You know what you're
doing, right?

20:54.454 --> 20:55.788
Yeah.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.609
♪ She only calls when
she's feeling down ♪

21:06.633 --> 21:09.512
♪ Trying to find her way out ♪

21:09.536 --> 21:11.347
Hey, you re a
pretty good driver!

21:11.371 --> 21:13.549
I've had my license for a year.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.950
So, what s her name?

21:14.974 --> 21:17.453
What did my mom tell you?

21:17.477 --> 21:19.522
What s her name?

21:19.546 --> 21:21.957
Her name is Becca and
it s not happening.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.593
Well, maybe you re just
not trying hard enough.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.895
A woman needs to know
that you re interested.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.331
No I'm trying.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.532
She knows that I know.

21:29.556 --> 21:33.993
Well, maybe we just need to
show her what she s missing.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.039
Okay, I've got an idea.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.507
What?

21:38.531 --> 21:39.808
You'll see!

21:39.832 --> 21:40.943
What?

21:40.967 --> 21:42.735
You'll see!

21:52.912 --> 21:54.523
She the cute one on the bench?

21:54.547 --> 21:55.991
Yeah.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.092
Follow my lead.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.528
Give me the keys.

21:59.552 --> 22:00.953
Oops!

22:13.833 --> 22:15.034
Hey guys.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.054
This looks great, thanks.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.113
Rachel, stand by.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.084
I see you made it back.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.095
Yes, Mr. Peterman.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.030
I just ran home
to get my laptop.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.265
Have you got a minute?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.800
Absolutely, come on in.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.769
Are you all prepared for
the McGregor pitch?

27:06.793 --> 27:09.037
Yes, it's coming
together, don't worry.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.774
It's a work in progress.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.341
Good.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.444
Our new associate
Miss Green has shared

27:16.468 --> 27:18.847
some of her ideas for
the new commercial.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.716
I think they're terrific.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.685
I think we need images
in the wilderness.

27:22.709 --> 27:26.722
Put the product in a
more natural setting.

27:26.746 --> 27:27.923
Thank you, Rachel.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.392
Caro, what do you think?

27:30.416 --> 27:33.929
I think that that's
a fantastic idea.

27:33.953 --> 27:37.065
Good! I'm glad you agree.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.926
Miss Green, keep
up the good work.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.752
Hey, what s up?

27:56.776 --> 28:00.022
Oh yeah I know, wasn
t that the best?

28:00.046 --> 28:04.817
No, the car belongs to this girl
that's renting our guest house.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.998
She s smoking hot...

28:10.022 --> 28:12.000
yeah, she's 21.

28:12.024 --> 28:16.171
That s not too old!

28:16.195 --> 28:18.206
Get this: I heard
that she swims naked.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.942
In our backyard, yeah.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.801
No, I'm being serious...

28:23.936 --> 28:26.949
She's in college studying
art or something...

28:26.973 --> 28:28.416
Logan?

28:28.440 --> 28:30.085
Logan, are you home?

28:30.109 --> 28:34.823
Dude, I think she s calling me
to the guest house right now.

28:34.847 --> 28:38.093
Yeah, I have to go. I
ll text you later.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.451
Bye!

28:48.004 --> 28:49.004
Hey!

28:49.028 --> 28:50.372
Hey.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.907
How was school today?

28:51.931 --> 28:53.075
Perfect.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.877
Becca was so jealous.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.946
She was, you were right, she
was taking me for granted.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.247
See, told you.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.016
You just have to trust me.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.384
And now you owe me a pose.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.386
No, that was not our deal.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.254
Yeah but it s my deal.

29:06.278 --> 29:09.992
Come on, I need a subject
for my homework.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.460
What're you afraid of?

29:12.484 --> 29:14.053
I m not afraid...

29:22.194 --> 29:23.963
Sit.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.880
Relax.

29:31.904 --> 29:35.017
You look so tense or nervous.

29:35.041 --> 29:38.220
Sorry, I ve just never done
anything like this before.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.488
You re gonna do great.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.958
But how do we get
you out of this?

29:42.982 --> 29:45.060
Oh that s not
happening, I'm sorry.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.562
Come on, my project
is on human forms,

29:47.586 --> 29:50.132
not human forms covered
up by a bunch of clothes.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.533
Lose the shirt.

29:51.557 --> 29:52.968
I know you're buff.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.827
All right, fine.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.133
You happy now?

30:12.311 --> 30:14.213
Very happy.

30:16.983 --> 30:20.295
How long is this gonna take you?

30:20.319 --> 30:23.222
I like to go slow.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.270
How do you like college?

30:28.294 --> 30:30.305
I like it.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.140
You seem excited about going.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.942
Yeah, I am actually.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.511
I worked really hard in
school this year, so...

30:36.535 --> 30:38.513
we'll see.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.049
Got your whole future
planned out, huh?

30:41.073 --> 30:43.151
Guess you gotta
please your parents?

30:43.175 --> 30:47.079
A business degree is
okay, I'll take that.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.093
Have you thought about
taking a year off?

30:51.117 --> 30:54.662
You know, exploring yourself,
doing some traveling?

30:54.686 --> 30:58.233
Yeah, I'm sure my parents
would love that idea.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.635
You gotta live your own life.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.971
I wasn t ready for college.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.007
I was glad I took the year off.

31:05.031 --> 31:07.109
I learned a lot about myself.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.243
Seriously?

31:08.267 --> 31:10.869
Seriously.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.618
Can you tilt your head down?

31:16.642 --> 31:18.253
Like you're looking
at the floor.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.687
Sure.

31:19.711 --> 31:23.058
And close your eyes.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.284
Perfect...

32:01.053 --> 32:02.364
Logan?

32:02.388 --> 32:04.090
Yeah, Mom?

32:05.391 --> 32:07.702
What s going on in there?

32:07.726 --> 32:09.337
Hey, Caro.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.974
Logan just wanted to help
with my art homework.

32:11.998 --> 32:14.309
I just wanted to let him
know our dinner plans.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.710
Put on your shirt.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.245
How was your day?

32:17.269 --> 32:19.005
Stressful.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.251
What were you doing?

32:23.275 --> 32:25.053
She was sketching me, what
do you think we were doing?

32:25.077 --> 32:26.121
It doesn't matter.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.489
Just leave her alone, okay?

32:27.513 --> 32:29.291
She's got a lot of
studying to do.

32:29.315 --> 32:30.625
It s just art, Mom.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.660
Okay, whatever.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.762
Look, your dad's having
dinner with a client

32:34.786 --> 32:36.298
and Hannah's bringing
over Chinese.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.266
That's fine, I'm gonna
go over to Brad s.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.930
We ll probably order a
pizza or something.

32:39.954 --> 32:41.923
Okay.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.575
Hey.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.144
Busted?

32:49.168 --> 32:52.180
No, but I'm sure I wasn t
that great of a model.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.482
You did everything I needed.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.284
Think about our little talk.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.153
You know, college can wait.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.022
You deserve a break.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.081
See you later.

33:19.265 --> 33:21.385
That was so delicious, was
that the new Chinese place?

33:21.409 --> 33:22.510
Yes. That's the one!

33:22.534 --> 33:24.746
That chicken was so good.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.181
Glad you liked it.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.082
Thanks for bringing it.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.208
You're welcome.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.189
So, work is so crazy busy.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.292
My new boss is so demanding,
I can't even tell you.

33:37.316 --> 33:41.396
And that new young associate
is very ambitious.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.298
I'm pretty sure
she's after my job.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.499
Sure.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.883
You know, these 20 somethings,
they go after what they want,

33:46.907 --> 33:48.103
and why not?

33:48.127 --> 33:50.127
They have better bodies,
better makeup and clothes,

33:50.151 --> 33:51.173
better everything.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.108
No, they don't.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.510
Hey, so how's that new
tenant working out for you?

33:55.534 --> 33:57.179
Good, she's really good.

33:57.203 --> 34:00.215
She's an art student at
Cornish and... yeah.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.150
She seems responsible.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.819
You know, earlier today,
I could have sworn

34:04.843 --> 34:06.788
I saw someone in your house.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.690
Yeah, I forgot my laptop and
had to come home and get it.

34:09.715 --> 34:16.197
I didn't see your car, but her
car was parked up the street.

34:16.222 --> 34:20.202
Okay, I know what you're doing
here and don't, please.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.837
Seriously, she doesn't
even have a key, so...

34:22.860 --> 34:24.072
Maybe...

34:24.096 --> 34:28.775
but I d keep my eye on her
if she was around my family.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.170
No, Elle is not Beth.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.484
Speaking of Beth Smith,
not sure if you heard

34:36.507 --> 34:42.190
but she's working now
at Barnblatt and Major.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.358
You heard, you heard.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.493
I don't care, it has nothing
to do with me anymore.

34:45.516 --> 34:49.197
It's been eight years, it
feels like a lifetime ago.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.233
I don't know how you can
forgive and trust again.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.125
I couldn't do it.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.498
You don't know this, but
it wasn't just Sam.

35:02.568 --> 35:07.849
I met somebody else during that
time while we were seperated.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.617
Yeah, it was a small
indiscretion,

35:09.641 --> 35:11.619
about three months.

35:11.643 --> 35:14.222
What happened?

35:14.246 --> 35:16.291
He told me he was
married and he wanted

35:16.315 --> 35:19.327
to leave his wife for
me and I just...

35:19.351 --> 35:21.429
So, what happened with him?

35:21.453 --> 35:23.865
I don t know, I never
saw him again.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.529
You know, I m really
glad that you and Sam

35:25.553 --> 35:27.235
were able to work things out.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.770
It gives hope to the rest of us.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.305
Me too.

35:30.329 --> 35:31.839
Look honey, you need some rest.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.308
I should go.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.652
Let s just do
something next week.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.611
All right, I'll walk you out.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.914
Hey, how are you feeling?

36:24.416 --> 36:26.294
One of my headaches again.

36:26.318 --> 36:29.231
Yeah? Can I get you anything?

36:29.255 --> 36:31.666
No, I'm okay. How
was your meeting?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.435
Long.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.619
I ve got a few e-mails to
send but I ll be in bed soon.

36:35.643 --> 36:36.711
Okay.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.598
Get some rest.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.383
Oh, I m sorry.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.362
No, it s okay.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.264
I was just taking a
late night soak.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.465
I can see that.

37:03.489 --> 37:04.699
Did I wake anyone?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.268
No.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.932
Caro, she's down with
a terrible headache.

37:07.956 --> 37:09.371
Oh...

37:09.395 --> 37:11.473
you re up late.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.341
Yeah, I just got back
from a business meeting.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.942
It s been a long day.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.578
Why don t you join me?

37:16.602 --> 37:20.415
The water s perfect and
there's plenty of room.

37:20.439 --> 37:23.351
That s okay, I should
be getting to bed.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.977
Ah, that's too bad.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.925
So, are you happy here?

37:30.949 --> 37:31.993
I love it.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.395
Great.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.059
You and your family
have been so welcoming

37:35.083 --> 37:36.898
and it feels like home.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.066
Well if you ever need
anything just let us know.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.303
Our door is always open.

37:41.327 --> 37:44.406
Would you mind
passing me my towel?

37:44.430 --> 37:46.598
No, not at all.

37:52.315 --> 37:53.315
Oops!

37:53.339 --> 37:53.981
Sorry.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.507
You peeked!

37:56.508 --> 37:59.478
Don t worry, it'll be
our little secret.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.491
Good night, Elle.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.493
Good night, Sam.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.952
Sleep well.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.355
Hey gorgeous.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.756
Good morning.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.058
You re up early for somebody
that went to bed so late.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.660
Morning, Caro.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.695
I'm making breakfast.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.064
Elle wanted to do
something nice for us.

38:43.088 --> 38:46.601
Yeah, to thank you for
making me feel so at home.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.069
Oh that's sweet.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.837
How are you feeling, honey?

38:49.861 --> 38:52.073
Better, better than last night.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.677
I'm just stressed out
with work, that's all.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.679
You know what's really relaxing?

38:57.703 --> 39:00.648
A nice soak in the jacuzzi.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.083
You want the same?

39:02.107 --> 39:03.709
Please.

39:04.920 --> 39:05.920
Good morning, Logan.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.723
I'm making eggs,
do you want some?

39:08.747 --> 39:11.158
No I'm cool, I ll probably
just grab something at lunch.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.594
Good morning.

39:12.618 --> 39:13.828
Good morning!

39:13.852 --> 39:16.130
So Becca is having
a party tonight.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.665
And?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.066
And I would like to go.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.735
Are Becca's parents
going to be there?

39:20.759 --> 39:22.239
Becca's parents are
going to be there.

39:22.263 --> 39:23.738
Then you can go.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.172
All right, sweet.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.841
Is this mine? Thank you.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.876
Are you going to
ask Becca to prom?

39:28.900 --> 39:29.944
What the hell? No! Stop!

39:29.968 --> 39:31.846
I gotta go to school,
you guys suck!

39:31.870 --> 39:32.947
Answer the question!

39:32.971 --> 39:33.981
Bye, see ya!

39:34.005 --> 39:35.883
He doesn't like talking
about stuff like that.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.752
I remember being like that.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.053
I think she'll say yes.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.154
I know it.

39:40.178 --> 39:40.922
There you go.

39:40.946 --> 39:41.489
Thank you.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.048
You're welcome, enjoy.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.701
Come in.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.036
What are those?

39:55.060 --> 39:57.104
They're the logos for
this new beauty line

39:57.128 --> 40:00.742
that we're doing and
they're terrible.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.176
What's it for?

40:02.200 --> 40:04.679
It's a new beauty line
that we're re-branding

40:04.703 --> 40:06.714
for a younger consumer.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.849
So, like me?

40:07.873 --> 40:09.216
Exactly like you.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.217
May I?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.043
Please.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.458
Terrible, right?

40:16.482 --> 40:18.760
They're not terrible,

40:18.784 --> 40:21.195
they just don't catch your eye.

40:21.219 --> 40:25.733
There's nothing young and
exciting about it, you know?

40:25.757 --> 40:27.993
Exactly.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.873
Would you consider
coming into the office

40:31.897 --> 40:35.142
and consulting on this
for me this afternoon?

40:35.166 --> 40:37.779
Oh, I don't know if I'm
qualified to do that.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.914
You are qualified, you
are the consumer.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.908
It would be so helpful
and I could pay you.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.187
Yeah, sure.

40:46.211 --> 40:49.757
Let me go change into
something nicer.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.192
I'll see you in a second.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.784
Okay.

40:56.187 --> 40:59.166
Okay, so it needs to
be simple and elegant

40:59.190 --> 41:01.869
with that natural,
organic feel to it?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.995
Yes, exactly.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.837
Who s that?

41:14.606 --> 41:17.284
Rachel, my junior associate.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.855
We got a new boss and she's
been taking my ideas

41:20.879 --> 41:22.957
and presenting them as her own.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.559
I think she's after my job.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.126
Wow.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.027
Yeah.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.962
So she manipulates
your trust and then,

41:27.986 --> 41:31.733
when you least expect it, she
goes right for the throat.

41:31.757 --> 41:32.934
Yeah.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.702
Can I be honest?

41:34.726 --> 41:36.137
Please.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.839
She probably thinks
she s smarter

41:37.863 --> 41:40.165
than you because she s younger.

41:42.133 --> 41:45.012
She doesn t see you as an
equal but more like an older,

41:45.036 --> 41:49.116
inferior boss and wants
to take what s yours.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.786
If you want something, take it.

41:51.810 --> 41:54.321
Maybe tonight I could come over
and go through your closet

41:54.345 --> 41:58.092
and we can pick out a
few power outfits.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.961
I guess I could use the help.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.929
Yeah, it could be really fun.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.593
And I will get home and
I'll start working

42:03.617 --> 42:06.033
on sketches for the new logo.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.268
Elle, what about your studies?

42:07.292 --> 42:08.970
I don't want to
keep you from that.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.638
No, it's fine really.

42:10.662 --> 42:12.106
I will make the time.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.341
I'm just so thankful for
everything you ve done for me.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.342
Okay.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.168
Okay!

42:46.632 --> 42:49.134
Are you kidding me?

43:41.052 --> 43:42.387
Are you serious?

44:31.970 --> 44:33.881
Can I help you?

44:33.905 --> 44:35.116
Hi.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.943
Oh gosh, you gave
me quite the scare.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.288
I m Hannah.

44:41.312 --> 44:43.024
I live next door.

44:43.048 --> 44:44.225
You must be Elle.

44:44.249 --> 44:45.893
What are you doing here?

44:45.917 --> 44:50.464
Oh, I just came to check
on the pool cleaner.

44:50.488 --> 44:52.967
Caro asked me to make sure
he changes the filter.

44:52.991 --> 44:55.102
He comes on Mondays.

44:55.126 --> 44:58.239
Oh gosh, I must have
my times mixed up.

44:58.263 --> 45:01.042
I m so sorry.

45:01.066 --> 45:02.409
Anything else?

45:02.433 --> 45:05.179
No, I ll leave you be.

45:05.203 --> 45:07.705
Have a good day.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.271
I picked up Logan s
tux for prom today.

45:30.295 --> 45:32.339
When did he grow up so fast?

45:32.363 --> 45:35.009
I don't know, but
don t remind me.

45:35.033 --> 45:36.277
How was your day?

45:36.301 --> 45:40.114
It was good, it was
busy but good.

45:40.138 --> 45:43.417
You know Elle came into the
office and helped me so much.

45:43.441 --> 45:48.155
She was so inspiring and we
had a nice conversation.

45:48.179 --> 45:52.326
She kind of reminded me that I
can still be a free spirit.

45:52.350 --> 45:53.830
Yeah, you never know
when you ll catch

45:53.854 --> 45:55.296
her being a very free spirit.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.530
Oh, in the pool?

45:56.554 --> 46:00.334
And the jacuzzi... last night.

46:00.358 --> 46:03.938
Okay, then I'll have
a word with her.

46:03.962 --> 46:06.240
And the jacuzzi, remember
when we used to...

46:06.264 --> 46:07.474
Of course I do.

46:07.498 --> 46:09.476
Just get going.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.502
Give that to him.

46:17.208 --> 46:18.844
Come in.

46:20.345 --> 46:21.847
Hi.

46:23.314 --> 46:25.592
Thank you so much for
today, first of all.

46:25.616 --> 46:28.229
Do you like any of these?

46:28.253 --> 46:30.989
Look, I can't do this right now.

46:32.557 --> 46:34.568
Sure, what's wrong?

46:34.592 --> 46:38.305
Caro, I don t want to cause
any problems, but...

46:38.329 --> 46:40.174
I have to give you my notice.

46:40.198 --> 46:42.376
I have to move.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.212
Okay, why?

46:45.236 --> 46:48.850
It s your neighbor, Hannah...

46:48.874 --> 46:52.153
she's kind of been spying
on me ever since I moved in

46:52.177 --> 46:54.889
and today I left my mother's
diary on a table by the pool

46:54.913 --> 46:57.558
and I came back and
found her reading it.

46:57.582 --> 47:00.227
Wow, I'm sorry.

47:00.251 --> 47:04.531
It's the most treasured
item I have from my mom.

47:04.555 --> 47:06.901
Of course...

47:06.925 --> 47:10.304
she can be a snoop sometimes,
but I'll talk to her.

47:10.328 --> 47:12.173
It won't happen again.

47:12.197 --> 47:15.409
I had this happen before
with a really creepy manager

47:15.433 --> 47:18.012
who used to spy on me
and steal my laundry

47:18.036 --> 47:19.516
and I don't want that
to happen again.

47:19.540 --> 47:21.382
It's too upsetting.

47:21.406 --> 47:24.618
It's unacceptable,
that's what it is.

47:24.642 --> 47:26.420
Look, I don't even
know why she thought

47:26.444 --> 47:29.090
it was okay for her
to be over here.

47:29.114 --> 47:32.393
She told me that you told her
to wait for the pool guy.

47:32.417 --> 47:37.498
Wow, I did not and the pool guy
doesn't come until Monday.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.266
Do you know what it s
like to have someone

47:39.290 --> 47:42.503
violate your privacy?

47:42.527 --> 47:46.340
No, I don't and I m
sure it was horrible.

47:46.364 --> 47:49.343
Hannah has been very distrustful
since her marriage broke down,

47:49.367 --> 47:51.512
but this is over the line.

47:51.536 --> 47:55.082
I just want to
feel at home here.

47:55.106 --> 47:57.451
Of course Elle, we want
you to feel at home.

47:57.475 --> 48:00.521
I will talk to her
and you have my word

48:00.545 --> 48:02.323
it'll never happen again.

48:02.347 --> 48:04.115
Okay.

48:07.518 --> 48:10.397
And look, we can do
this another time.

48:10.421 --> 48:11.432
You sure?

48:11.456 --> 48:13.324
Of course.

48:27.438 --> 48:28.515
Knock knock.

48:28.539 --> 48:30.317
You gonna ask her tonight?

48:30.341 --> 48:32.486
That's my plan.

48:32.510 --> 48:33.520
What was her name again?

48:33.544 --> 48:34.721
Becca.

48:34.745 --> 48:38.292
Becca... man look at
you, all grown up.

48:38.316 --> 48:40.327
Your dorm pack came today.

48:40.351 --> 48:42.632
You wanna go through it and
pick out a room for next fall?

48:42.656 --> 48:44.531
I don't know.

48:44.555 --> 48:46.367
What do you mean you don't know?

48:46.391 --> 48:48.302
I don't know.

48:48.326 --> 48:50.304
I don't know if I really
want to go to college.

48:50.328 --> 48:53.574
I think I might want to
take a break or travel...

48:53.598 --> 48:55.409
just something.

48:55.433 --> 48:57.378
And when did you decide this?

48:57.402 --> 48:59.213
I've actually been
thinking about it a lot

48:59.237 --> 49:01.382
and I don't really know
what I want to do.

49:01.406 --> 49:03.985
Well, we should sit down and
discuss it as a family.

49:04.009 --> 49:05.729
Me and your mother have
been planning on you

49:05.753 --> 49:07.254
going to school for a long time.

49:07.278 --> 49:10.015
Brad's on his way to pick me up.

49:12.417 --> 49:14.261
Be back by 11.

49:14.285 --> 49:15.420
Thanks Dad.

49:26.264 --> 49:27.574
What'cha doing?

49:27.598 --> 49:29.276
My ride to the party is late.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.345
You want a ride?
I'll give you one.

49:31.369 --> 49:33.271
Yeah sure, thank you.

49:34.472 --> 49:37.684
So I talked to my dad about
maybe taking the year off

49:37.708 --> 49:39.586
and not going to
college right away.

49:39.610 --> 49:40.930
So you re actually
considering it?

49:40.954 --> 49:42.114
I am actually considering it.

49:42.138 --> 49:43.390
What did he say?

49:43.414 --> 49:44.725
He wasn t too happy.

49:44.749 --> 49:46.660
I'm sure my mom won't
be too happy either.

49:46.684 --> 49:48.495
I was only suggesting
it as an option.

49:48.519 --> 49:49.763
I understand.

49:49.787 --> 49:51.665
If I do it, it's all
my own decision.

49:51.689 --> 49:53.558
Okay, as long as
it's your decision.

50:03.268 --> 50:05.546
♪ You always said
that I was too open ♪

50:05.570 --> 50:08.349
♪ I've got more problems
than you were hoping ♪

50:08.373 --> 50:13.411
♪ Soon I'll rebel
like a swing set ♪

50:20.451 --> 50:21.662
What? What s wrong?

50:21.686 --> 50:23.497
Derrick s here.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.400
Hey, would you mind
coming inside with me?

50:26.424 --> 50:29.294
Just until I have time
to scope out the place.

50:47.178 --> 50:48.422
What's up guys?

50:48.446 --> 50:50.481
Hey.

50:53.718 --> 50:55.729
She s busy talking to him.

50:55.753 --> 50:58.489
It's okay, just play it cool.

50:59.790 --> 51:01.502
He's giving her his jacket!

51:01.526 --> 51:02.836
It's okay.

51:02.860 --> 51:04.471
Hey look, she's alone.

51:04.495 --> 51:05.606
Now's your turn.

51:05.630 --> 51:07.165
Go!

51:11.479 --> 51:12.479
You made it.

51:12.503 --> 51:13.514
Yeah, of course.

51:13.538 --> 51:14.615
Becca, this is Elle.

51:14.639 --> 51:15.749
Hi.

51:15.773 --> 51:17.818
You have a lovely home.

51:17.842 --> 51:20.421
Thank you.

51:20.445 --> 51:24.291
Brad was late, so
she gave me ride.

51:24.315 --> 51:26.560
I will let you guys talk
and I'll go mingle.

51:26.584 --> 51:28.662
It was nice to meet you.

51:28.686 --> 51:29.796
How old is she?

51:29.820 --> 51:31.398
21...

51:31.422 --> 51:34.335
I saw you talking to Derrick.

51:34.359 --> 51:36.370
I told you he might be coming.

51:36.394 --> 51:38.772
I m still friends
with him, Logan.

51:38.796 --> 51:41.332
Becca...

51:42.433 --> 51:45.146
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?

51:45.170 --> 51:48.749
Okay, get right to the point.

51:48.773 --> 51:50.717
Yeah, that sounds great.

51:50.741 --> 51:52.253
Wait, seriously?

51:52.277 --> 51:54.721
Yeah, I was wondering when
you were gonna ask me.

51:54.745 --> 51:58.392
Come on, you have to see
the chocolate fountain.

51:58.416 --> 52:00.185
There's a chocolate fountain?

52:06.924 --> 52:09.594
Honey, is this going
to be a problem?

52:11.496 --> 52:15.442
Not unless Hannah does it again.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.511
Well, we need the extra
income for Logan.

52:17.535 --> 52:19.880
We don't want to lose
Elle as a tenant.

52:19.904 --> 52:22.483
I know, I'll talk
to her tonight.

52:22.507 --> 52:25.852
She needs to understand how
important this is to us.

52:25.876 --> 52:27.554
She knows.

52:27.578 --> 52:28.679
Okay.

52:45.363 --> 52:47.532
See anything you like?

52:49.867 --> 52:52.570
I see a lot of things I like.

52:53.938 --> 52:55.682
I m Derrick.

52:55.706 --> 52:57.984
Elle.

52:58.008 --> 53:00.454
Are you and Logan
seeing each other?

53:00.478 --> 53:02.956
No, it s not like that.

53:02.980 --> 53:04.858
What s it like then?

53:04.882 --> 53:07.928
I don't think you're old
enough to find out.

53:07.952 --> 53:10.564
I m 18...

53:10.588 --> 53:12.833
try me.

53:12.857 --> 53:15.836
What about Becca s parents?

53:15.860 --> 53:18.496
What about Becca's parents?

53:26.337 --> 53:27.872
Come on.

53:39.584 --> 53:41.027
Take your shirt off.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.763
Don't you want to
know what I read?

53:42.787 --> 53:44.698
No, I don't want to
know what you read.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.633
Her mother died when
she was 12 years old,

53:46.657 --> 53:49.670
you invaded her space,
her private memories.

53:49.694 --> 53:51.972
This is just like what
happened with our nanny...

53:51.996 --> 53:54.508
Stop! Hannah, come on.

53:54.532 --> 53:56.710
We need this money, Hannah.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.612
It's the only way we can
pay for Logan's dorms.

53:58.636 --> 53:59.980
Please stay out of it.

54:00.004 --> 54:01.244
You don't see what she's doing?

54:01.268 --> 54:03.738
Tell me, what is she doing?

54:06.877 --> 54:09.356
The naked swims, the
flirting with Logan.

54:09.380 --> 54:11.825
I mean just last night she was
in the jacuzzi and Sam was...

54:11.849 --> 54:13.059
I know, he told me.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.895
He told me all about
it last night.

54:14.919 --> 54:18.823
I'm not trying to meddle, I'm
just trying to be a good friend.

54:19.957 --> 54:21.768
Ow, that hurt! What?

54:21.792 --> 54:22.969
We're done.

54:22.993 --> 54:24.638
Are you crazy?

54:24.662 --> 54:26.840
You re gonna stay away from
Becca and Logan, understand?

54:26.864 --> 54:28.864
Otherwise, I ve got enough
DNA under my fingernails

54:28.888 --> 54:31.288
to prove to any court that you
tried to force yourself on me.

54:31.312 --> 54:32.646
What?

54:32.670 --> 54:35.782
Don t think I won t try and
destroy you, understand?

54:35.806 --> 54:37.975
Have fun at the party, Derrick.

54:41.812 --> 54:43.781
Okay... sorry.

55:05.703 --> 55:08.615
So, how did it go?

55:08.639 --> 55:09.750
How did what go?

55:09.774 --> 55:10.751
Come on.

55:10.775 --> 55:11.985
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

55:12.009 --> 55:14.489
You guys already ratted me out
to Elle and made me look stupid.

55:14.513 --> 55:15.055
Come on!

55:15.079 --> 55:16.056
Spit it out!

55:16.080 --> 55:16.957
She said yes.

55:16.981 --> 55:18.058
Yes!

55:18.082 --> 55:19.059
Nice!

55:19.083 --> 55:20.561
I knew it.

55:20.585 --> 55:21.862
I'm proud of you, son. It
takes a lot of courage.

55:21.886 --> 55:22.629
Thanks guys.

55:22.653 --> 55:23.813
I'm gonna go to bed. Love you.

55:23.837 --> 55:27.401
I can't believe he's gonna
go off to college so soon.

55:27.425 --> 55:28.893
Yeah, about that...

56:05.696 --> 56:06.973
I don't get it.

56:06.997 --> 56:09.743
Why the sudden change of heart?

56:09.767 --> 56:12.479
I think it's something
with Becca.

56:12.503 --> 56:13.747
I know he really likes her.

56:13.771 --> 56:15.516
I mean, he could've
said something before.

56:15.540 --> 56:18.519
Before we sent out applications.

56:18.543 --> 56:19.744
I know.

56:21.579 --> 56:22.889
Who's that?

56:22.913 --> 56:23.924
Spam.

56:23.948 --> 56:26.860
We spent so much
money traveling,

56:26.884 --> 56:29.730
we went to every single
college he was interested in.

56:29.754 --> 56:32.966
Wilton is his favorite,
it's his top choice!

56:32.990 --> 56:36.069
Maybe we pushed this business
major on him too hard.

56:36.093 --> 56:37.804
No, no we didn't.

56:37.828 --> 56:40.865
He's gonna go to college
just as planned.

56:41.943 --> 56:42.943
If you say so.

56:42.967 --> 56:44.611
Are you gonna tell him, or am I?

56:44.635 --> 56:45.779
I'll tell him.

56:45.803 --> 56:47.805
Yeah? Mama bear...

57:10.928 --> 57:13.740
You know I'm sorry.

57:13.764 --> 57:16.710
Let me make it up to you.

57:16.734 --> 57:17.868
Drinks?

57:41.826 --> 57:44.037
I can't believe
you're still working.

57:44.061 --> 57:46.540
I can't believe how
beautiful you are.

57:46.564 --> 57:47.774
You think so?

57:47.798 --> 57:50.076
Yeah, come here.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.869
What?

57:53.771 --> 57:55.248
No no no.

57:55.272 --> 57:56.683
I got to if it's work.

57:56.707 --> 57:58.151
No!

57:58.175 --> 57:59.720
Okay, who is it?

57:59.744 --> 58:00.687
Nobody.

58:00.711 --> 58:02.580
Exactly!

58:27.638 --> 58:31.818
Not now, meet soon...

58:31.842 --> 58:34.011
Love Sam.

58:36.647 --> 58:38.549
I've got you now, Beth.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.719
Hello?

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:13.854
Elle, hey.

01:00:13.878 --> 01:00:15.118
It's Caro, how are you feeling?

01:00:15.142 --> 01:00:18.725
I'm well, just working
on a project.

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:20.794
I wanted you to know
that I talked to Hannah

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:22.262
and she apologized.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.830
That s good to hear.

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:29.259
She said that she'd never
do it again, okay?

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:33.163
Thank you for taking
care of that.

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:36.843
Of course.

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:39.880
So, will you stay?

01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:41.214
Oh, I m not leaving.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:44.117
I still have a lot
of work to do.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.986
That's great!

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:49.723
Look, Sam is making his famous
Spaghetti Bolognese tonight.

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:51.858
Do you want to come over
and have dinner with us?

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:54.127
Thanks, but I have a sketch
to finish for class tomorrow.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.395
Okay.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:58.865
Well Logan's at Becca s
having a study date,

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:02.168
so there will be plenty of food
leftover if you re-think it.

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:03.970
I ll see.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.274
All right, well have a good day.

01:01:05.298 --> 01:01:07.300
Oh, I will.

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:17.784
This is the best one
you've ever made.

01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:19.285
Yeah, you liked it?

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:21.988
I think it was the extra
garlic and basil.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.381
Let me get these out of the way.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:44.878
We had so much leftover I
made a plate for Elle.

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:47.948
Do you mind bringing
it over to her?

01:01:47.972 --> 01:01:49.149
Yeah, of course.

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:51.241
Thanks.

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:23.316
Hey.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.985
Hey, did you have dinner yet?

01:02:25.009 --> 01:02:28.254
Oh, uh no, I ve been working
and lost track of the time.

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:32.826
Consider my famous pasta a peace
offering for the nosy neighbor.

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.250
We're sorry about
that, we just want

01:02:34.274 --> 01:02:35.554
to make sure you're comfortable.

01:02:35.578 --> 01:02:36.830
Thanks.

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:38.298
Caro said that she'd
take care of it,

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:40.366
so I guess I'll stay.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.202
That's great news.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:46.306
So happy to hear that and
again, we are really sorry.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.008
Good night.

01:02:48.032 --> 01:02:49.499
Good night.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.452
Who's that?

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:03.089
I've gotta text London
back, it s their morning.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.357
Is everything okay?

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:06.383
Of course.

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:24.110
You've gotta be honest with me.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.948
If something was wrong you
would tell me, right?

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:29.850
Honey, I don t know what
you want me to say.

01:03:29.874 --> 01:03:31.084
There's nothing wrong.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:33.954
It s just a difficult
time, that's all.

01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:35.221
I know.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.023
Hey, after this presentation,

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:40.093
me and you will go away
together to wine country.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:41.094
Okay?

01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:43.921
Just us, we deserve it.

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:49.102
All right, good night.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:50.928
I love you too.

01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:33.379
Tonight s the big night.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:34.471
He'll be so excited.

01:04:40.044 --> 01:04:42.088
Are you not going
into work today?

01:04:42.112 --> 01:04:43.992
I am a little bit later,
I just have some things

01:04:44.016 --> 01:04:45.191
to do around the house first.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:48.128
Don t stress, you're
gonna get this account.

01:04:48.152 --> 01:04:49.987
I know it.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.089
Bye sweetheart.

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:24.448
Hey!

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:29.262
Hey, I just came
home to pick up...

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:30.287
Those?

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:33.266
Are those Naughty Nancy's?

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:34.434
Who?

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.658
You know, they could actually
be any one of these girls.

01:06:36.682 --> 01:06:38.171
What are you talking about?

01:06:38.195 --> 01:06:41.174
This was my worst fear.

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:44.544
We have worked so hard for years

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:47.613
to finally build trust, to...

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:48.797
Caro, I need you to calm down

01:06:48.821 --> 01:06:50.450
and explain to me
what s going on.

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:52.385
Who's texting you?

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:53.386
It s spam.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.188
I've been getting a ton
of texts on my phone

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:56.622
from people I don't know.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:58.091
You have been getting spam.

01:06:58.115 --> 01:06:59.325
You wanna know why you've
been getting spam?

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:00.593
Because you're on
a dating website,

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:01.594
that's why you're getting spam.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:03.563
I have read every one
of these messages, Sam.

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:04.697
Look, there's no messages.

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.466
I'm not on a dating website.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.767
I'm not 19.

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:10.236
You're gonna make me
walk you through this?

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:13.206
Yes, walk me through this.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.432
Marriedbutfree.com.

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:20.504
Next time you do this, clear
your browser history.

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:28.288
I didn't do this,
Caro you have to...

01:07:28.312 --> 01:07:31.524
This is obviously a sick joke
someone's playing on us.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.559
It's a sick joke, yeah.

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:35.428
But I'm not laughing, Sam.

01:07:35.452 --> 01:07:39.223
Caro, honey, I m not
cheating on you.

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:42.202
Don't touch me!

01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:44.337
I'm not ready for this.

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.472
Can we not do this today?

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:49.333
For Logan, please?

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:59.643
We'll talk about this
another time, okay?

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:56.533
Close your eyes...

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:02.606
Oh, Logan!

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.231
Hey, I'm almost ready.

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:19.564
You re a bastard.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:20.765
Excuse me?

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.368
You can forget about tonight.

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:23.671
I knew you wanted
to be with her.

01:09:23.696 --> 01:09:26.238
Who? What're you talking about?

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:27.573
You re pathetic.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.675
Go to the prom with
her if you want.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.212
Becca, wait...

01:09:32.236 --> 01:09:34.247
Derrick was right.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.381
I was such a fool.

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.675
Don't ever call me again!

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:48.852
What?

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:53.765
Logan?

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.767
What was that?

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:55.768
Did something break?

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:57.570
Nothing broke and nothing
happened, all right?

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:59.434
Hang on, I gotta get some
pictures of the prom.

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:00.034
You look great!

01:10:00.058 --> 01:10:01.241
I m not going to prom.

01:10:01.265 --> 01:10:01.874
What?

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:02.842
I'm not going to prom!

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:04.444
Why not?

01:10:04.468 --> 01:10:05.745
Just let me...

01:10:05.769 --> 01:10:06.946
No!

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.414
Calm down and talk about this.

01:10:08.438 --> 01:10:09.849
You have to let me go, okay?

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.584
Excuse me, I'm taking a walk.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:13.586
All right, I don't know
what's going on with him.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.421
I don't know what's
going on with you.

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:17.890
Will somebody just talk to me?

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:19.859
Nobody is gonna talk to you.

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.561
I'm not gonna talk to you.

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:24.897
I'm not the one that's
having the affair!

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.457
I'm not cheating on you!

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:33.539
Poor Sam...

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.633
Once a cheater,
always a cheater.

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:54.860
You had us worried.

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:56.686
Are you okay?

01:10:58.599 --> 01:10:59.599
I m fine.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:02.335
I just had to take a long walk.

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:03.769
Yeah...

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:06.071
well whatever happened
with Becca, I'm sorry.

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.497
Yeah.

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:11.377
What are you doing out here?

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:12.912
Your mother and I
had an argument.

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:14.847
Was it because of me?

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:18.642
No son, it wasn't
because of you.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.488
I m gonna go to bed.

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:24.924
Wait a second.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.992
All right, come here.

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:28.461
Love you buddy.

01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:30.487
Love you too, thanks dad.

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:33.590
See you tomorrow.

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:04.821
Wow, you look amazing...

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:08.534
I have a lot of work
to do today, so...

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:11.537
Yeah well, you're
gonna do great today.

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:13.563
You can tell me about it after.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:20.904
Come in!

01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:24.016
Good morning.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.418
Good morning!

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:26.686
Today is the big day.

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:28.621
Did you get my e-mail
about the logo ideas?

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:30.556
I did, thank you.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.392
They really helped.

01:12:32.416 --> 01:12:33.559
You look great!

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:34.627
Really?

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.629
Yes, yes I do.

01:12:36.653 --> 01:12:38.631
How are you going to
do the presentation?

01:12:38.655 --> 01:12:40.800
It's in there.

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:42.659
Oh, I have your money.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:54.013
Thank you.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.080
Thank you so much.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.048
You're welcome.

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:57.016
You're going to kill it!

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:57.983
Good luck.

01:12:58.007 --> 01:12:59.409
Okay.

01:13:15.559 --> 01:13:19.171
Can't talk, at work.

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:23.543
Wife's out of town,
going home for lunch.

01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:25.502
Come by at noon?

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:28.438
That should do it.

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:59.002
Aww, can't wait to see you too.

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:05.585
We're really excited to
see the presentation.

01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:07.877
This launch really big for us.

01:14:12.916 --> 01:14:15.695
Hi, good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:16.999
I m Caroline
Winters, as you know

01:14:17.023 --> 01:14:18.831
I'm the project manager here.

01:14:18.855 --> 01:14:20.966
I want to start by
saying that our team

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:25.270
has been working around
the clock to ensure

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:29.675
that you have the newest,
freshest marketing strategy

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:30.910
for your new beauty line.

01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:34.547
I think we can all agree that by
taking a more modern approach,

01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:39.051
we can really attract
that younger consumer.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:43.055
We can win them over by the
quality of the product,

01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:45.257
and gain their loyalty.

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:46.959
At the same time
building a great,

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.094
strong social media presence.

01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:50.520
Caroline?

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:03.075
So by gaining a lot of
internet presence, we can...

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:06.135
Caroline, is there a problem?

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.085
Okay, it looks like I grabbed

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:16.756
the wrong flash
drive by accident.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.824
I'll just run down
and get my laptop,

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.225
please give me one moment.

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:22.018
Caroline?

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:26.098
My apologies for
the interruption.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:28.801
I have a presentation, Mr.
Peterman.

01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:31.094
Wonderful, please go ahead.

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:37.000
Oh, I like the look of this...

01:15:48.812 --> 01:15:50.546
Excuse me.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:57.020
Never mind, Miss Green is
taking over the presentation.

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.666
This is unacceptable.

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:03.102
Your mistake may cause
the clients to believe

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:04.937
that we can't handle
their products.

01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:06.972
Sir, no disrespect,
but I have been

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:08.874
on that account from day one.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:10.109
I deserve to be in that pitch.

01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:12.712
No, you've jeopardized enough.

01:16:12.736 --> 01:16:14.714
I m taking you off this
account right now.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:16.015
What?

01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:17.741
Excuse me.

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:26.115
Tough break.

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:27.853
Sam?

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:30.780
It s Beth... where are you?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:36.185
Sam?

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:40.156
You know how I like surprises.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.905
Sam, don t be a tease!

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.526
Hey, it s Beth.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.829
Leave me a message and
I ll call you back.

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.330
Beth I don't know
what's going on,

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:47.757
but stay away from my house.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.795
Hello?

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:30.198
Beth?

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:55.935
Hi, Elle.

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:59.371
Hey Caro, I m sorry to
bother you at work, but...

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:02.341
Sam s home early from work

01:20:02.365 --> 01:20:03.885
and there s another
woman in the house.

01:20:03.909 --> 01:20:06.111
She's blonde, maybe 30?

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.246
You can you see her?

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:09.081
Yeah, I can see her.

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:11.583
I just thought it was weird
and maybe you'd want to know.

01:20:11.607 --> 01:20:15.044
Yeah, I m coming over.

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:26.122
Poor Sam...

01:20:58.154 --> 01:20:59.322
Sam?

01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:03.292
Welcome home.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:10.475
What are you doing?

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:12.568
It s a tragic story.

01:21:15.338 --> 01:21:18.517
See, I m the little girl.

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:21.120
And that woman is my mother.

01:21:21.144 --> 01:21:26.225
And I m sure you recognize
my father, James?

01:21:26.249 --> 01:21:27.927
What did you call it?

01:21:27.951 --> 01:21:30.553
One small indiscretion?

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.332
I don t understand...

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:35.034
No, of course you don't.

01:21:35.058 --> 01:21:37.536
Because you didn t even
remember him after it was over.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.439
You didn t suffer
like my family did.

01:21:40.463 --> 01:21:42.174
I don t know what you mean.

01:21:42.198 --> 01:21:46.946
He left us for you and
it crushed my mother,

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:48.347
it ruined her life.

01:21:48.371 --> 01:21:50.449
Then you dumped him and
he came crawling back,

01:21:50.473 --> 01:21:52.417
but the damage was done.

01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:55.320
You went back to Sam and
lived happily ever after,

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:57.322
like nothing ever happened!

01:21:57.346 --> 01:22:02.061
But my mom had lost everything
including the will to live.

01:22:02.085 --> 01:22:06.465
So one day, she turned
the gun on him and then

01:22:06.489 --> 01:22:10.169
she killed herself and I was
the one who found them.

01:22:10.193 --> 01:22:11.403
I m sorry, Elle.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:14.273
I would never have done anything
to hurt you or your family.

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:17.042
Yeah, well you did!

01:22:17.066 --> 01:22:20.345
And you know, I realized that I
was never really gonna be able

01:22:20.369 --> 01:22:24.583
to move on until you felt what
it was like to have everything

01:22:24.607 --> 01:22:27.519
that you cherish
ripped from you.

01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:29.421
Okay but...

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:31.223
why Beth?

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:34.326
Because it all
started with Beth.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:37.129
If she hadn't had
that affair with Sam,

01:22:37.153 --> 01:22:39.631
you never would've
been with my father.

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:41.466
She's only here because
she thought Sam

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:44.193
was texting her from that phone.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:49.108
Shut up!

01:22:49.132 --> 01:22:50.409
You don t have to do this.

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:52.011
Yes, I do.

01:22:52.035 --> 01:22:54.346
Logan needs to suffer
the way that I did

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:58.317
ever since my parents
died because of you.

01:22:58.341 --> 01:23:00.319
So here's the plan:

01:23:00.343 --> 01:23:03.255
Sam was cheating on you again
with his former secretary

01:23:03.279 --> 01:23:05.560
and then you came home and found
the two of them together,

01:23:05.584 --> 01:23:07.559
and in a fit of rage
killed them both

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:11.030
and then yourself with this gun.

01:23:11.054 --> 01:23:12.264
I'm not gonna shoot anyone.

01:23:12.288 --> 01:23:15.758
No you don't have
to, that's my job.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.071
You're crazy!

01:23:19.095 --> 01:23:20.639
That's what my
psychiatrist told me,

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:22.541
so I stopped going.

01:23:22.565 --> 01:23:25.210
Listen we can fix this,
we can talk about it.

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:27.546
Your parents wouldn't
want you to do this.

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:29.214
Shut up!

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:31.340
Don't ever mention
my parents again.

01:23:35.611 --> 01:23:36.621
Mom?

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.381
Call the police!

01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:52.337
No, please! I didn't mean to!

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:54.206
I didn't know what I was
doing, please don't...

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:56.141
Mom, are you okay?

01:23:56.165 --> 01:23:58.167
Call the police, now!

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:23.135
Logan!

01:24:23.159 --> 01:24:25.137
Logan, open the door!

01:24:25.161 --> 01:24:27.272
Come on Logan, I swear
if you make that call,

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:29.108
I m going to kill your mother.

01:24:29.132 --> 01:24:31.400
Logan come on,
open the door now!

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:39.508
Lock her in.

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:51.896
I'm so sorry about
her, and about us.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.565
It's a nightmare.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.291
It's over now.

01:24:56.325 --> 01:24:58.237
It's my fault though, honey.

01:24:58.261 --> 01:25:00.372
I should've trusted you, Sam.

01:25:00.396 --> 01:25:02.307
No, it's no one's fault.

01:25:02.331 --> 01:25:04.376
She fooled all of us.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.535
I still can t believe it.

01:25:09.672 --> 01:25:13.342
I would've died if anything
happened to my family.

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:17.522
You saved us.

01:25:17.546 --> 01:25:20.159
You saved us...

01:25:20.183 --> 01:25:22.251
we re not going anywhere.

01:25:45.241 --> 01:25:47.352
These are very good, Elle.

01:25:47.376 --> 01:25:49.388
It looks like your
art therapy project

01:25:49.412 --> 01:25:51.290
is helping with
your anger issues.

01:25:51.314 --> 01:25:53.225
Yes, I agree.

01:25:53.249 --> 01:25:55.460
Go ahead and finish
this sketch pad

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:57.396
and I'll get you another one.

01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.264
In the meantime, I'm
going to make a note

01:25:59.288 --> 01:26:00.799
in your file about
your good behavior.

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:02.634
It s a positive sign.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:05.394
Thank you, Doctor.

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:44.600
You destroyed my family!

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:49.481
You destroyed my life!

01:26:49.505 --> 01:26:52.575
You destroyed everything!
