01:31.781 --> 01:33.449
What's happening?

01:34.409 --> 01:36.952
- Why are you taking a bath?
- I'm not.

01:39.247 --> 01:40.330
Shit.

01:43.126 --> 01:45.753
We got to find a way out.
Everybody, come on.

01:45.837 --> 01:49.506
Where are you?

02:39.058 --> 02:40.225
Papa!

02:46.941 --> 02:49.943
It's okay. It's just another earthquake.

02:52.154 --> 02:53.780
I'm right here.

02:54.657 --> 02:55.698
Right here. Okay.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.680
The clocks stopped at 1:17.

03:20.641 --> 03:23.518
There was a long shear of bright light,

03:24.270 --> 03:26.771
then a series of low concussions.

03:34.989 --> 03:36.823
I think it's October,

03:38.742 --> 03:40.577
but I can't be sure.

03:41.495 --> 03:43.955
I haven't kept a calendar for years.

03:49.753 --> 03:52.797
Each day is more gray than the one before.

03:53.299 --> 03:58.178
It is cold and growing colder
as the world slowly dies.

03:59.263 --> 04:03.349
No animals have survived,
and all the crops are long gone.

04:07.189 --> 04:10.107
Soon all the trees in the world will fall.

04:19.117 --> 04:22.536
The roads are peopled
by refugees towing carts

04:22.621 --> 04:24.955
and gangs carrying weapons,

04:25.707 --> 04:28.042
looking for fuel and food.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.025
Within a year, there were fires on the ridges

04:53.109 --> 04:54.985
and deranged chanting.

05:02.077 --> 05:04.245
There has been cannibalism.

05:04.788 --> 05:07.206
Cannibalism is the great fear.

05:13.964 --> 05:17.299
Mostly I worry about food, always food.

05:18.468 --> 05:21.095
food and the cold and our shoes.

05:36.611 --> 05:40.781
Sometimes I tell the boy old stories
of courage and justice,

05:41.449 --> 05:43.951
difficult as they are to remember.

05:44.828 --> 05:47.497
All I know is the child is my warrant,

05:48.624 --> 05:53.253
and if he is not the word of God,
then God never spoke.

06:22.742 --> 06:26.995
"...flea, you could land
on Lady Liberty's torch.

06:28.664 --> 06:31.708
"If you flicked your tongue like a chameleon,

06:31.792 --> 06:34.502
"you could whip the food off your plate

06:34.587 --> 06:36.379
"without using your hands.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.883
"But what would your mother say?

06:39.634 --> 06:42.345
"If you craned your neck like a crane,

06:42.429 --> 06:45.765
"you'd have to stretch your arm way up

06:46.350 --> 06:48.267
"to scratch your head.

06:50.771 --> 06:55.107
"If you had eagle eyes,
you could spot a running rabbit."

08:03.302 --> 08:05.011
Let's take a look.

08:20.528 --> 08:23.697
There could be something here.
Corn or something.

08:24.365 --> 08:25.574
No.

08:27.201 --> 08:29.035
They ran out of food.

08:37.044 --> 08:40.005
Maybe there's some hayseeds in the hayloft.

08:40.923 --> 08:42.381
I doubt it.

08:57.690 --> 08:59.733
It's not what you think.

09:00.735 --> 09:02.694
They committed suicide.

09:03.404 --> 09:04.571
Why?

09:05.573 --> 09:07.073
You know why.

09:27.095 --> 09:30.097
Two left. One for you, one for me.

09:43.779 --> 09:46.948
You put it in your mouth
and you point it up,

09:48.116 --> 09:50.076
just like I showed you.

09:50.744 --> 09:51.869
Okay.

09:51.954 --> 09:53.955
- Like this.
- No.

09:56.124 --> 09:58.417
Then just pull the trigger.

09:58.502 --> 10:00.002
You got it?

10:03.131 --> 10:04.632
Is that okay?

10:05.759 --> 10:06.968
Okay.

10:34.413 --> 10:36.163
Are you hungry?

10:37.708 --> 10:39.041
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

10:39.126 --> 10:42.420
- I'm thirsty.
- Thirsty? Some water?

10:43.005 --> 10:44.088
Okay. Hey.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.009
You look pretty.

11:00.523 --> 11:01.940
Oh, no.

11:09.616 --> 11:10.741
No.

11:19.709 --> 11:21.668
No, we don't have to do this.

11:21.753 --> 11:24.546
- I don't want to do this.
- I think we do.

11:24.922 --> 11:26.632
No, I don't want to do this.

11:26.716 --> 11:28.759
What kind of life is this?

11:29.385 --> 11:31.136
You got to push.

11:31.512 --> 11:32.512
No.

11:32.597 --> 11:33.889
Come on,

11:36.726 --> 11:37.809
push.

12:24.273 --> 12:25.816
Quick! Get up!

12:33.866 --> 12:36.285
We got to run. Go. Stay low. Go, go.

12:38.414 --> 12:40.206
- Papa. Papa.
- Let's go.

13:03.355 --> 13:05.690
Check those junkers over there.

13:06.442 --> 13:07.608
Shit.

13:17.661 --> 13:19.370
Where's your head?

13:50.861 --> 13:54.363
- Watch the damn cars up ahead.
- Jog along beside them.

13:59.703 --> 14:00.745
Damn it.

14:03.707 --> 14:06.042
Don't look at them. Look at me.

14:06.919 --> 14:09.086
You call out, you're dead.

14:09.588 --> 14:11.214
Where you from?

14:11.590 --> 14:13.174
Does it matter?

14:13.884 --> 14:15.510
Where you from?

14:16.553 --> 14:19.223
You got ammunition for those rifles?

14:20.391 --> 14:22.851
I told you not to look over there.

14:30.068 --> 14:31.485
What are you eating?

14:31.569 --> 14:33.403
Whatever we can find.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.572
Whatever you can find.

14:35.782 --> 14:36.990
Yeah.

14:46.584 --> 14:49.044
You ain't gonna shoot that thing.

14:50.255 --> 14:53.298
You ain't got but two shells. Maybe one.

14:54.175 --> 14:57.594
- And they'll hear the shot.
- Maybe, but you won't,

14:59.264 --> 15:04.184
because it'll be through your skull and
inside your brain before you can hear it.

15:04.435 --> 15:06.395
To hear it, you'll need a frontal lobe

15:06.479 --> 15:10.023
and things with names like colliculus
and temporal gyrus,

15:10.108 --> 15:13.986
but you won't have them anymore
because they'll just be soup.

15:14.445 --> 15:16.029
You a doctor?

15:16.614 --> 15:18.156
I'm not anything.

15:18.241 --> 15:21.410
We got a hurt man. It'd be worth your while.

15:24.205 --> 15:26.039
You look at him again
and I'll shoot you in the head.

15:26.124 --> 15:29.376
That boy looks hungry.
Why don't y'all come on to the truck?

15:29.460 --> 15:31.545
Get you something to eat.

15:32.338 --> 15:34.965
Ain't no need to be such a hard-ass.

15:36.301 --> 15:38.719
You don't have anything to eat.

15:39.804 --> 15:41.638
Come on. Let's go.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.099
I ain't going nowhere.

15:44.517 --> 15:46.685
You think I won't kill you?

15:49.689 --> 15:50.731
You're wrong.

15:50.815 --> 15:52.816
You know what I think?

15:53.568 --> 15:55.819
I think you're chicken-shit.

15:56.362 --> 15:58.989
You never killed a man in your life.

16:12.296 --> 16:13.546
- Where'd that come from?
- Right there!

16:13.631 --> 16:14.839
Who's shooting?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.355
Let's go. Come on.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.858
- At the tree line!
- Come on!

16:38.864 --> 16:41.741
- The two of you, that way.
- Move quicker.

16:41.825 --> 16:43.993
- Move!
- I think I see him. Let's go!

16:52.420 --> 16:53.837
Over there!

17:17.362 --> 17:19.780
You're okay. I'm right here.

17:22.992 --> 17:24.242
Let's go.

17:52.106 --> 17:55.275
I try to look like any common traveling killer,

17:57.236 --> 17:59.279
but my heart is hammering.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.324
When it comes to the boy,

18:05.119 --> 18:06.953
I have only one question.

18:09.457 --> 18:11.249
Can you do it

18:13.127 --> 18:15.128
when the time comes?

18:19.925 --> 18:21.384
All right?

18:24.263 --> 18:26.264
I won't let anything happen to you.

18:26.432 --> 18:28.391
I'll take care of you.

18:35.149 --> 18:37.817
And I'll kill anyone who touches you,

18:40.654 --> 18:42.655
because that's my job.

19:15.022 --> 19:17.023
You got to stop crying.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.400
We got to go now.

19:20.486 --> 19:22.612
We got to go find the cart.

19:29.246 --> 19:30.704
Come on.

19:32.415 --> 19:33.999
Take the gun.

20:27.637 --> 20:29.763
That's all we have left.

20:32.893 --> 20:34.268
I should've done it a long time ago.

20:34.352 --> 20:35.936
I should've done it
when we had more bullets.

20:36.021 --> 20:38.606
I don't know why I listened to you.

20:40.275 --> 20:44.111
They're gonna catch up with us
and they're going to kill us.

20:45.947 --> 20:49.283
They're gonna rape me,
and then they're gonna rape your son

20:49.367 --> 20:52.119
and they're gonna kill us and eat us.

20:52.787 --> 20:54.413
- Whatever it takes...
- Stop it.

20:54.497 --> 20:56.498
- I told you...
- Stop it!

20:58.335 --> 21:01.462
I will do anything. Anything.

21:03.673 --> 21:05.132
Like what?

21:11.974 --> 21:15.310
I don't even know why I ask you.
I should just go ahead

21:15.394 --> 21:18.939
and empty every goddamn bullet
into my brain and leave you with nothing.

21:19.023 --> 21:23.068
- That's what I should do.
- Please don't talk like that.

21:27.156 --> 21:30.450
You're right.
There's nothing left to talk about.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.374
My heart was ripped out of me
the night he was born.

21:42.380 --> 21:45.215
We have to. We will survive this.

21:45.299 --> 21:49.970
We are not gonna quit.
We're not gonna quit.

21:53.307 --> 21:55.558
I don't want to just survive.

21:56.727 --> 21:58.478
Don't you get it?

21:59.355 --> 22:01.064
I don't want to.

22:06.279 --> 22:08.989
Why won't you let me take him with me?

22:10.491 --> 22:12.075
Don't touch it.

22:14.537 --> 22:18.456
I would take him with me
if it weren't for you. You know that.

22:19.208 --> 22:20.875
Listen to yourself.

22:23.379 --> 22:24.921
You sound

22:27.758 --> 22:29.175
crazy.

22:51.825 --> 22:54.076
Other families are doing it.

23:25.609 --> 23:27.401
Let's go take a bath.

24:04.773 --> 24:06.107
Listen,

24:07.109 --> 24:08.818
we have to talk.

24:11.363 --> 24:13.322
That man back there...

24:17.119 --> 24:20.162
There's not many good guys left, that's all.

24:21.373 --> 24:25.000
We have to watch out for the bad guys.
We have to just

24:26.253 --> 24:28.587
keep carrying the fire.

24:33.636 --> 24:35.345
What fire?

24:36.681 --> 24:38.557
The fire inside you.

24:48.192 --> 24:50.026
Are we still the good guys?

24:50.111 --> 24:52.529
Yes, we're still the good guys.

24:53.197 --> 24:54.781
Of course we are.

24:54.866 --> 24:57.534
And we always will be?

24:58.453 --> 25:00.579
No matter what happens?

25:02.582 --> 25:04.332
Always will be.

25:29.567 --> 25:31.067
What is it?

25:33.404 --> 25:35.238
It's a treat for you.

25:47.502 --> 25:48.919
Go ahead.

26:11.442 --> 26:13.151
It's really good.

26:14.279 --> 26:17.156
- You should have some.
- No, you drink it.

26:18.534 --> 26:20.618
I want you to have some.

26:23.372 --> 26:24.872
It's bubbly.

26:39.137 --> 26:40.763
It's for you.

26:51.149 --> 26:52.483
Come on.

26:55.821 --> 26:57.238
I'm coming.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.861
I'm hungry.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.363
I know. So am I.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.370
And we're still heading south?

27:46.539 --> 27:47.623
Of course.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.293
There might be food there.

27:51.377 --> 27:54.838
Everything depends
on reaching the coast, okay?

27:56.884 --> 27:58.009
Okay.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.478
I wish I was with my mom.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.862
You mean you wish you were dead?

28:19.365 --> 28:20.615
Yeah.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.748
You mustn't say that. It's a bad thing to say.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.587
I can't help it.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.423
You have to stop thinking about her.

28:39.093 --> 28:40.760
We both do.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.100
How do we do that?

29:00.072 --> 29:02.865
You did it right. You did it right.

31:14.082 --> 31:17.167
Aren't you at least
gonna say goodbye to him?

31:17.252 --> 31:18.836
- No.
- No?

31:18.920 --> 31:21.589
No.

31:23.092 --> 31:25.009
- Why not?
- I can't.

31:26.554 --> 31:29.097
Why can't you stay till morning?

31:32.685 --> 31:34.394
Because I can't.

31:34.937 --> 31:36.521
Can't you spend one more night with me?

31:36.605 --> 31:38.565
- No, I have to go.
- Why?

31:40.693 --> 31:42.694
Why do you have to go?

31:42.778 --> 31:46.281
Why? Why do you have to go?

31:54.456 --> 32:03.882
What am I gonna tell him?

32:12.182 --> 32:13.266
God.

32:13.434 --> 32:14.893
You go south.

32:15.269 --> 32:16.311
No.

32:16.562 --> 32:19.314
You keep him warm and you go south.

32:21.817 --> 32:24.652
You won't survive another winter here.

32:33.245 --> 32:35.330
Why won't you help me?

32:36.832 --> 32:39.584
Where are you going?
You can't even see out there.

32:39.668 --> 32:42.337
I don't need to. I don't need to see.

32:46.008 --> 32:47.759
- I'm begging...
- Don't.

32:48.427 --> 32:50.053
- Please.
- No.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.347
Don't.

33:00.397 --> 33:01.731
She was gone,

33:03.276 --> 33:06.236
and the coldness of it was her final gift.

33:08.823 --> 33:11.367
But she died somewhere in the dark.

33:14.287 --> 33:16.664
There is no other tale to tell.

33:35.517 --> 33:37.851
Look, there's colors.

33:43.775 --> 33:45.609
You want to go in?

33:52.158 --> 33:53.575
I got you!

34:27.360 --> 34:28.610
Come on.

34:57.975 --> 34:59.142
Papa.

35:26.253 --> 35:28.588
There's a reason this is locked.

36:02.206 --> 36:03.873
Come help me.

36:17.555 --> 36:19.556
Nothing's gonna happen.

36:35.490 --> 36:36.907
It's okay.

36:54.259 --> 36:55.593
What's that?

37:04.186 --> 37:05.686
Oh, my God.

37:05.770 --> 37:10.232
Help us. Please, will you help us?

37:13.486 --> 37:15.988
- Help us.
- Let's go! Let's go!

37:17.282 --> 37:18.783
Help me.

37:19.035 --> 37:20.535
Wait! Wait!

37:21.287 --> 37:24.122
They're taking us to the smokehouse.

37:25.833 --> 37:27.125
Go, go!

37:28.419 --> 37:30.337
- Stop!
- Wait!

37:36.093 --> 37:38.136
No. No. No!

37:39.305 --> 37:40.388
No.

38:19.429 --> 38:21.847
Bad guys. Bad men.

38:24.017 --> 38:26.060
Bad men. Bad guys.

38:29.648 --> 38:31.607
Who left this window open?

38:31.692 --> 38:34.235
- I leave it open for the smell.
- What smell?

38:34.319 --> 38:36.737
- You don't smell it anymore?
- Who wants a drink?

38:36.989 --> 38:38.239
Don't waste the wine.

38:45.539 --> 38:48.791
Yeah, it's gonna keep raining.
It's gonna rain all day.

38:48.875 --> 38:51.002
I'm going up to change.

38:52.170 --> 38:53.838
They're bad guys.

38:54.256 --> 38:55.548
Bad guys.

38:56.550 --> 38:57.883
- Take it.
- No. No.

38:57.968 --> 38:59.719
- Take it! Take it. Take it.
- No.

38:59.886 --> 39:02.471
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

39:04.891 --> 39:09.395
When they get hold of you, you're gonna
have to do it just like everybody else.

39:11.523 --> 39:15.234
You have to be brave. You have to!
You know how to do it.

39:15.319 --> 39:17.611
- You know how.
- Be right up.

39:17.696 --> 39:19.655
Bad guys. Bad men.

39:24.786 --> 39:26.620
What are you doing?

39:28.415 --> 39:30.207
I'm so sorry.

39:33.670 --> 39:35.629
Will I see you again?

39:36.548 --> 39:39.175
When will I see you? No.

39:39.259 --> 39:40.926
What's going on?

39:41.261 --> 39:42.970
What the hell is that?

39:43.055 --> 39:44.430
Hey!

39:50.354 --> 39:51.604
Fuck!

39:52.231 --> 39:54.358
He was out of the cellar. I pushed it over.

39:55.485 --> 39:56.943
God damn it.

39:59.614 --> 40:02.574
- Come on!
- Where do you think you're going?

41:04.303 --> 41:06.388
- Hey, hold him.
- I got him!

41:07.849 --> 41:09.683
You son of a bitch!

41:28.035 --> 41:29.953
Hey, come on. Wake up.

41:30.705 --> 41:32.372
Wake up. Wake up.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.959
We got to get out of here.

41:35.043 --> 41:37.712
- We got to go now. We got to get away.
- Get off me.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.213
Come on.

41:41.091 --> 41:42.550
Let's run.

41:50.476 --> 41:51.851
Last one.

42:07.576 --> 42:10.411
We would never eat anybody, would we?

42:12.789 --> 42:14.916
No, of course not.

42:18.378 --> 42:20.630
No matter how hungry we were?

42:23.217 --> 42:25.259
Even if we were starving?

42:25.677 --> 42:27.553
We're starving now.

42:29.348 --> 42:31.432
Because we're the good guys.

42:33.310 --> 42:34.519
Yes.

42:35.103 --> 42:37.396
And we're carrying the fire.

42:42.736 --> 42:43.986
Yes.

43:01.296 --> 43:02.713
This way.

43:07.803 --> 43:09.845
What is this place, Papa?

43:11.974 --> 43:14.058
The house where I grew up.

43:29.993 --> 43:31.493
That's me.

43:39.252 --> 43:43.422
This is where we used to have
our Christmas tree when I was a boy.

43:52.515 --> 43:55.434
And here's where we'd hang our stockings.

44:00.106 --> 44:01.273
It's...

44:11.701 --> 44:14.411
I don't think we should be doing this.

44:26.507 --> 44:28.592
You want to wait outside?

46:08.652 --> 46:10.027
No, wait!

46:10.279 --> 46:12.113
- Hey!
- Wait!

46:14.324 --> 46:15.867
Wait! Come on!

46:16.410 --> 46:19.036
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Hey. Hey.

46:21.373 --> 46:22.749
- What are you doing?
- No.

46:22.833 --> 46:24.333
What are you doing?

46:24.418 --> 46:26.377
- What are you doing?
- What?

46:26.462 --> 46:29.297
- There's a little boy, Papa!
- What little boy? What are you...

46:29.381 --> 46:31.132
- I saw a little boy!
- What the hell are you doing?

46:31.216 --> 46:32.800
I saw a little boy.

46:32.885 --> 46:36.012
- There's no boy. What boy?
- Get off. There is! Just like me.

46:37.097 --> 46:38.556
- Come on.
- No!

46:39.475 --> 46:40.433
Hey!

46:40.517 --> 46:44.104
- Stop it! You scared the hell out of me.
- No!

46:44.189 --> 46:46.982
- Come on, let's go. Stop it.
- I need to see him!

46:47.192 --> 46:49.109
Hey! What the hell...

46:50.195 --> 46:52.029
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

46:53.865 --> 46:55.199
- I need to!
- Why?

46:55.283 --> 46:56.867
I just do!

46:58.411 --> 46:59.578
Stop it.

46:59.662 --> 47:01.288
He's right there.

47:01.498 --> 47:03.040
I understand.

47:03.541 --> 47:06.543
- I understand. It's okay.
- Right there.

47:10.715 --> 47:12.382
It's gonna be all right.

47:25.438 --> 47:28.565
He imagines how things will be at the coast,

47:29.734 --> 47:33.029
and that there will be other children there.

47:33.113 --> 47:35.907
He asks me what happened to my friends,

47:35.991 --> 47:39.911
and I tell him they died and that I miss them.

47:46.043 --> 47:48.127
When I have nothing else,

47:48.629 --> 47:51.923
I try to dream the dreams
of a child's imaginings.

48:12.820 --> 48:14.696
Are we gonna die now?

48:20.870 --> 48:23.372
What do you think is gonna happen?

48:24.875 --> 48:28.460
You think we're just gonna
suddenly keel over and die?

48:28.920 --> 48:30.754
It takes a long time

48:31.590 --> 48:33.757
to die of starvation.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.957
Every day is a lie,

49:08.043 --> 49:10.127
but I am slowly dying.

49:10.837 --> 49:12.546
That is not a lie.

49:15.550 --> 49:18.969
I'm trying to prepare him
for the day when I'm gone.

49:34.027 --> 49:36.570
Nothing you haven't seen before.

50:47.768 --> 50:53.106
Papa!

50:57.403 --> 50:58.903
- What?
- Papa.

50:59.113 --> 51:00.613
What's wrong?

51:01.615 --> 51:02.782
Look.

51:04.952 --> 51:06.536
We look skinny.

51:08.372 --> 51:09.956
We are skinny.

51:12.793 --> 51:15.295
Come on. Let's get out of here.

51:44.408 --> 51:46.826
Your mother played really well.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.747
I don't remember.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.375
Well, that was

51:54.086 --> 51:55.252
before.

52:39.089 --> 52:40.881
- Don't.
- It's okay.

52:41.716 --> 52:43.300
Please, Papa.

52:43.677 --> 52:44.927
Please.

52:46.972 --> 52:48.305
It's okay.

52:58.775 --> 53:00.192
Oh, my God.

53:02.237 --> 53:03.821
Come down here.

53:06.950 --> 53:08.450
Come down.

53:08.535 --> 53:10.286
What did you find?

53:10.662 --> 53:12.079
Everything.

53:13.081 --> 53:14.915
I found everything.

53:28.013 --> 53:29.931
What is all this stuff?

53:30.641 --> 53:31.850
Food.

53:33.144 --> 53:34.519
It's food.

53:35.771 --> 53:38.732
Here. See? Can you read the label?

53:41.986 --> 53:43.278
"Pears."

53:43.779 --> 53:45.655
Yes, pears.

53:53.998 --> 53:56.374
What do you want for breakfast?

54:15.978 --> 54:17.020
What?

54:17.146 --> 54:20.315
Nothing.

54:20.816 --> 54:23.318
Is it okay for us to take all this?

54:25.071 --> 54:26.071
Yeah.

54:26.614 --> 54:27.781
They'd want us to.

54:32.536 --> 54:34.621
Shouldn't we thank them?

54:34.705 --> 54:36.331
Yeah, go ahead.

54:43.756 --> 54:45.173
Like this?

54:48.886 --> 54:50.887
Thank you for

54:52.181 --> 54:53.473
soup

54:54.016 --> 54:56.351
and Cheetas.

54:57.895 --> 54:59.062
Cheetos.

54:59.146 --> 55:01.690
And all this stuff,

55:02.358 --> 55:03.608
people.

55:06.946 --> 55:08.363
That's good.

55:09.490 --> 55:10.907
Your turn.

55:16.748 --> 55:19.333
Thank you, people.

56:01.543 --> 56:03.044
You like that?

56:10.135 --> 56:12.428
We did good, didn't we, Papa?

56:14.765 --> 56:15.931
Yeah.

56:26.443 --> 56:34.784
Go to sleep.

58:59.349 --> 59:00.516
What?

59:02.936 --> 59:04.228
Don't...

59:06.272 --> 59:08.106
Don't touch my stuff.

59:08.650 --> 59:11.068
Okay, sorry.

59:42.976 --> 59:44.393
Now I'll give you a treat.

59:44.477 --> 59:46.853
- What?
- Keep your eyes closed.

59:46.938 --> 59:48.480
How does that feel?

59:48.565 --> 59:51.316
Shampoo.

59:54.988 --> 59:56.238
Better?

59:57.156 --> 59:58.282
Yep.

01:00:26.145 --> 01:00:27.687
How do I look?

01:00:33.027 --> 01:00:34.819
What do you think?

01:00:57.134 --> 01:00:58.718
Can I try some?

01:01:00.054 --> 01:01:02.180
- Why?
- You won't like it.

01:01:06.185 --> 01:01:08.019
Makes you feel funny.

01:01:17.237 --> 01:01:18.571
You okay?

01:01:27.414 --> 01:01:30.583
You think I come from another world,
don't you?

01:01:35.673 --> 01:01:36.923
Sort of.

01:01:47.976 --> 01:01:49.519
What was that?

01:01:55.359 --> 01:01:57.360
It sounded like a dog.

01:02:08.623 --> 01:02:10.290
It's not a dog.

01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:13.544
It is.

01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:16.630
It is a dog.

01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:19.466
If it's a dog,

01:02:21.094 --> 01:02:23.011
it'll be with someone.

01:02:23.596 --> 01:02:24.680
But who?

01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:28.392
I don't know.

01:02:29.436 --> 01:02:31.812
I'm not waiting to find out.

01:02:31.896 --> 01:02:33.313
- Come on.
- No, I don't want to go.

01:02:33.398 --> 01:02:35.399
It's not safe here anymore.

01:02:35.483 --> 01:02:37.443
- But...
- We're going.

01:02:39.779 --> 01:02:42.781
What are we gonna do with all this stuff?

01:02:42.866 --> 01:02:45.492
We'll just have to take what we can.

01:02:46.244 --> 01:02:49.121
You always think bad things
are gonna happen.

01:02:49.205 --> 01:02:51.248
But we found this place.

01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:59.089
Blankets on the cart.

01:03:07.974 --> 01:03:09.433
I see him.

01:03:38.213 --> 01:03:40.589
I don't have anything for you.

01:03:40.673 --> 01:03:42.758
You can look if you want.

01:03:43.344 --> 01:03:45.220
I got nothing.

01:03:45.304 --> 01:03:46.971
We're not robbers.

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.223
What?

01:03:52.478 --> 01:03:54.646
I said we're not robbers.

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.481
Well, what are you?

01:03:56.565 --> 01:03:58.441
We're just like you.

01:03:58.526 --> 01:04:02.195
- Well, what are you following me for?
- We're not following you.

01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:06.449
- We've got food we could give him.
- He's not getting any food.

01:04:06.867 --> 01:04:09.619
- He's scared, Papa.
- Everybody's scared.

01:04:11.622 --> 01:04:13.164
Please, Papa.

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:16.626
All right.

01:04:17.545 --> 01:04:18.920
Just one.

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:31.933
Here,

01:04:32.393 --> 01:04:33.726
take it.

01:04:41.652 --> 01:04:44.904
- What about a spoon?
- He's not getting a spoon.

01:04:49.577 --> 01:04:50.660
You

01:04:52.371 --> 01:04:53.663
pull it.

01:04:55.332 --> 01:04:56.791
You got to

01:04:58.085 --> 01:04:59.878
eat it. It's good.

01:05:17.187 --> 01:05:18.688
He's hungry.

01:05:19.607 --> 01:05:20.940
I see it.

01:05:22.276 --> 01:05:25.988
And I know what you're gonna ask me,
and the answer is no.

01:05:27.115 --> 01:05:28.908
What's the question?

01:05:30.744 --> 01:05:32.494
We can't keep him.

01:05:48.053 --> 01:05:50.512
You want to have dinner with us?

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:55.601
I don't know. What do I have to do?

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:58.354
You don't have to do anything.

01:05:58.438 --> 01:06:01.357
- Can you walk okay?
- Yeah, I can.

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.777
- Help him.
- You help him.

01:06:05.487 --> 01:06:06.695
I can't.

01:06:06.988 --> 01:06:08.405
I can walk.

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.532
No, I can walk.

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:25.214
How old are you?

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.091
I'm 90.

01:06:28.093 --> 01:06:29.843
Ninety, my ass.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.805
Is that what you tell people
so they don't hurt you?

01:06:35.392 --> 01:06:37.685
- Does it work?
- Nope.

01:06:42.357 --> 01:06:44.066
What's your name?

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:46.694
- Ely.
- "Ely"?

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:49.321
What's wrong with Ely?

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:51.323
Don't hold his hand.

01:07:18.102 --> 01:07:21.396
That little boy, is he your little boy?

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:24.524
Your son?

01:07:26.068 --> 01:07:27.819
- Yeah.
- What's it look like?

01:07:28.195 --> 01:07:30.905
I don't know. I can't see real good.

01:07:33.534 --> 01:07:35.535
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:07:38.205 --> 01:07:39.831
Can you see me?

01:07:39.915 --> 01:07:42.625
No, but I can tell somebody's there.

01:07:43.669 --> 01:07:44.919
Yeah.

01:07:47.214 --> 01:07:50.050
- Okay.
- Good little boy. Yeah.

01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:52.761
- Okay, time for you to go to sleep.
- No.

01:07:52.845 --> 01:07:54.012
Yes.

01:07:54.346 --> 01:07:56.347
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:59.393
- Good night.
- Go to sleep.

01:07:59.478 --> 01:08:01.270
Good night, son.

01:08:10.155 --> 01:08:12.406
You can see that, can't you?

01:08:13.325 --> 01:08:14.617
Yeah.

01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:24.585
When I saw that boy,

01:08:27.756 --> 01:08:30.006
I thought I'd died and he...

01:08:30.841 --> 01:08:32.551
He was an angel.

01:08:34.179 --> 01:08:36.055
I had a boy one time

01:08:37.099 --> 01:08:38.640
of my own.

01:08:46.316 --> 01:08:50.779
I never thought I'd see a child again,
never thought that would

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:52.781
happen to me.

01:08:53.491 --> 01:08:55.117
He is an angel.

01:08:56.786 --> 01:08:58.578
To me, he's a god.

01:09:01.415 --> 01:09:03.625
But I hope that's not true.

01:09:04.585 --> 01:09:07.921
To be on the road with the last god like that

01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:11.216
would be nothing

01:09:14.011 --> 01:09:16.179
but a dangerous situation.

01:09:20.518 --> 01:09:22.644
What happened to your son?

01:09:29.152 --> 01:09:31.153
I can't talk about it.

01:09:34.823 --> 01:09:37.158
Not with you, anyway.

01:09:49.921 --> 01:09:53.383
I knew this was coming,
this or something like it.

01:09:53.926 --> 01:09:55.802
There were warnings.

01:09:57.638 --> 01:10:01.433
Yeah, some people thought it was a con.
I always believed in it.

01:10:02.518 --> 01:10:03.518
Yeah.

01:10:03.603 --> 01:10:07.022
- Did you try to get ready for it?
- What would you do?

01:10:07.106 --> 01:10:10.775
Even if you knew what to do,
you wouldn't know what to do.

01:10:11.152 --> 01:10:12.819
But supposing

01:10:17.033 --> 01:10:19.534
you were the last man left alive?

01:10:22.955 --> 01:10:26.082
How would you know that,
that you were the last man alive?

01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:29.586
Well, I don't guess you'd know it.
You'd just be it.

01:10:36.553 --> 01:10:38.387
Maybe God would know.

01:10:38.889 --> 01:10:40.973
God wouldn't know what...

01:10:41.683 --> 01:10:44.477
God wouldn't know what he knows.

01:10:44.937 --> 01:10:49.315
If there is a God up there, he would
have turned his back on us by now.

01:10:49.775 --> 01:10:53.903
And whoever made humanity
will find no humanity here.

01:10:54.446 --> 01:10:56.656
No, sir. No, sir.

01:10:57.366 --> 01:10:58.741
So beware.

01:10:59.576 --> 01:11:00.826
Beware.

01:11:02.537 --> 01:11:04.872
Do you ever wish you would die?

01:11:05.874 --> 01:11:06.999
No.

01:11:07.376 --> 01:11:10.795
It's foolish to ask for luxuries
in times like these.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:22.056
- He's gonna die and you don't care.
- I care enough.

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:28.187
Maybe when we run out of food,
you'll have more time to think about it.

01:11:28.605 --> 01:11:32.024
Yeah, well, you always say,
"Watch out for bad guys."

01:11:32.359 --> 01:11:36.779
That old man wasn't a bad guy.
You can't even tell anymore.

01:11:50.085 --> 01:11:52.003
That'll keep it safe.

01:11:53.213 --> 01:11:56.215
- Do you know where we are?
- About 100 miles from the coast,

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.050
as the crow flies.

01:11:58.844 --> 01:12:00.678
"As the crow flies"?

01:12:02.055 --> 01:12:05.349
It means going in a straight line,

01:12:05.434 --> 01:12:06.809
which we can't.

01:12:06.893 --> 01:12:09.312
There aren't any crows, are there?

01:12:09.396 --> 01:12:12.481
- Just in books.
- Yep, just in books.

01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:16.236
Do you think
there could be crows somewhere?

01:12:16.321 --> 01:12:18.280
I think it's unlikely.

01:12:19.032 --> 01:12:21.575
Could they fly to Mars or someplace?

01:12:24.162 --> 01:12:26.413
You know what? Let's go back.

01:12:40.094 --> 01:12:41.595
What is it?

01:12:45.308 --> 01:12:47.601
Let's go. Let's go. Run. Run.

01:12:54.901 --> 01:12:56.360
Go! Go!

01:12:58.946 --> 01:13:00.989
No. No!

01:13:01.074 --> 01:13:02.282
Let's go.

01:13:02.367 --> 01:13:05.035
- No!
- Let's go. Let's go. Run.

01:13:38.945 --> 01:13:40.654
Hey! Hey! Hold on!

01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:42.155
Stop!

01:13:45.827 --> 01:13:47.160
In there!

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.496
Keep your head down!

01:14:08.267 --> 01:14:10.476
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:13.188 --> 01:14:14.647
- It's okay.
- No!

01:14:15.357 --> 01:14:16.816
It's okay.

01:14:25.367 --> 01:14:26.951
It's gone now.

01:15:59.128 --> 01:16:01.004
I had a bad dream.

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:16.270
Stop.

01:16:21.901 --> 01:16:24.987
I tell him, "When you dream
about bad things happening,

01:16:25.071 --> 01:16:28.657
"it shows you're still fighting.
You're still alive.

01:16:30.451 --> 01:16:33.453
"It's when you start
to dream about good things

01:16:33.538 --> 01:16:36.123
"that you should start to worry."

01:16:41.504 --> 01:16:42.921
Here?

01:16:43.006 --> 01:16:44.047
No,

01:16:44.882 --> 01:16:47.050
we're closer than you think.

01:16:49.178 --> 01:16:50.554
That's us,

01:16:51.764 --> 01:16:53.807
and this is all the sea.

01:16:57.854 --> 01:16:59.021
This?

01:17:01.941 --> 01:17:03.358
Is it blue?

01:17:04.652 --> 01:17:06.028
The sea?

01:17:06.904 --> 01:17:08.488
I don't know,

01:17:09.198 --> 01:17:10.616
used to be.

01:17:38.896 --> 01:17:40.021
Wait.

01:17:57.498 --> 01:17:59.540
I'm sorry it's not blue.

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:11.219
We'll be all right.
We'll just keep heading south.

01:18:15.517 --> 01:18:17.601
What's on the other side?

01:18:21.231 --> 01:18:22.606
Nothing.

01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:27.152
There has to be something.

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:30.030
Maybe there's a father

01:18:31.282 --> 01:18:34.952
and his little boy,
and they're sitting on a beach, too.

01:18:47.632 --> 01:18:49.133
You all right?

01:18:49.217 --> 01:18:51.468
- What is it? What is it?
- I don't feel too...

01:18:52.971 --> 01:18:54.138
Jesus!

01:18:56.599 --> 01:18:58.308
You're burning up.

01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:03.231
Sorry.

01:19:03.315 --> 01:19:05.984
It's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.

01:19:11.282 --> 01:19:18.913
I'm right here.

01:19:26.672 --> 01:19:28.757
Can I ask you a question?

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:31.426
Of course.

01:19:36.807 --> 01:19:39.017
What would you do if I died?

01:19:45.191 --> 01:19:46.649
If you died,

01:19:49.487 --> 01:19:51.446
I'd want to die, too.

01:19:53.866 --> 01:19:55.950
So you could be with me?

01:19:56.035 --> 01:19:57.160
Yeah,

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.121
so I could be with you.

01:20:22.394 --> 01:20:24.229
What are you doing?

01:20:25.564 --> 01:20:27.190
I'm going out to that boat.

01:20:27.274 --> 01:20:28.817
What are you gonna do?

01:20:28.901 --> 01:20:31.027
See what I can find for us.

01:20:33.948 --> 01:20:36.574
Here. You keep a good lookout.

01:20:37.952 --> 01:20:39.202
Okay?

01:20:40.329 --> 01:20:41.454
Okay.

01:20:42.581 --> 01:20:43.915
Stay warm.

01:22:01.703 --> 01:22:03.954
Hey! What the hell happened?

01:22:05.081 --> 01:22:07.625
- I'm sorry!
- They took everything!

01:22:08.168 --> 01:22:09.543
Our food,

01:22:11.087 --> 01:22:12.463
my shoes.

01:22:15.008 --> 01:22:16.634
Son of a bitch!

01:22:18.845 --> 01:22:20.930
- It's okay. Listen, it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:22:21.014 --> 01:22:22.348
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to.

01:22:22.432 --> 01:22:23.599
- It's okay.
- I fell asleep.

01:22:23.683 --> 01:22:25.976
Listen, don't lose heart.
We're gonna get it back.

01:23:05.768 --> 01:23:09.270
Get away from the cart. Put the knife down.

01:23:09.355 --> 01:23:11.898
Fuck you. I ain't putting down shit.

01:23:15.027 --> 01:23:18.238
- God damn you.
- Papa, please don't kill the man!

01:23:18.781 --> 01:23:20.073
Please.

01:23:28.249 --> 01:23:29.666
All right.

01:23:33.379 --> 01:23:35.588
All right, I done what you said.

01:23:35.673 --> 01:23:37.841
- Please, Papa.
- Listen to the boy.

01:23:37.925 --> 01:23:39.509
- How long you been following us?
- Following you?

01:23:39.593 --> 01:23:42.429
- How long?
- Nobody been fucking following you.

01:23:42.513 --> 01:23:46.725
I saw the cart in the sand, just took it,
that's all. I ain't touch the boy.

01:23:46.809 --> 01:23:48.351
- Take your clothes off.
- No.

01:23:48.436 --> 01:23:51.771
- Take them off! Every goddamn stitch.
- You don't want to do this.

01:23:51.856 --> 01:23:54.649
- Do it.
- All right. All right. All right.

01:23:55.151 --> 01:23:57.527
- Just take it easy.
- I'll kill you.

01:23:57.611 --> 01:23:59.612
Right where you stand.

01:24:00.281 --> 01:24:02.323
I don't want no trouble.

01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:12.835
Please, mister.

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:17.715
You ain't got to do this.

01:24:24.473 --> 01:24:27.641
And the shoes. Throw them in the cart.

01:24:29.394 --> 01:24:31.353
Throw them in the cart!

01:24:36.318 --> 01:24:37.568
Do it.

01:24:44.367 --> 01:24:46.577
You ain't got to do this to me, man.

01:24:46.661 --> 01:24:48.829
You ain't got to do me like this.

01:24:48.914 --> 01:24:51.248
- You didn't mind doing it to us.
- I'm begging.

01:24:51.333 --> 01:24:52.374
- I'm begging, please.
- Papa!

01:24:52.459 --> 01:24:54.460
Listen to the boy, man.

01:24:54.753 --> 01:24:56.337
I is starving.

01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.590
You'd have done the same thing.

01:24:59.674 --> 01:25:01.383
I'll die out here.

01:25:03.762 --> 01:25:05.596
I'm gonna die out here, man.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.682
I'm gonna leave you just the way you left us.

01:25:10.852 --> 01:25:12.561
Help me pull the cart.

01:25:12.646 --> 01:25:14.188
Pull the cart!

01:25:16.066 --> 01:25:18.609
What do you think would've happened
if we hadn't caught him?

01:25:18.693 --> 01:25:20.861
- You've got to learn.
- I don't want to learn!

01:25:20.946 --> 01:25:23.656
I'm not gonna be around forever!

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.618
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to look after yourself.

01:25:27.702 --> 01:25:30.037
Help me with the goddamn cart!

01:25:46.763 --> 01:25:48.848
Would you stop sulking?

01:25:50.058 --> 01:25:51.433
He's gone.

01:25:53.104 --> 01:25:55.147
- He's not gone.
- What do you want me to do?

01:25:55.231 --> 01:25:57.065
Just help him, Papa.

01:25:58.568 --> 01:26:00.110
Just help him.

01:26:00.736 --> 01:26:02.404
He's just hungry.

01:26:04.282 --> 01:26:05.824
He's gonna die.

01:26:05.908 --> 01:26:07.909
He's gonna die anyway.

01:26:08.953 --> 01:26:10.662
He was so scared.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.748
I'm scared. You understand?

01:26:14.417 --> 01:26:15.834
I'm scared.

01:26:19.088 --> 01:26:22.382
You're not the one that has to worry
about everything.

01:26:22.466 --> 01:26:23.758
I am so.

01:26:24.385 --> 01:26:26.678
What? What'd you say?

01:26:27.763 --> 01:26:29.347
Yes, I am!

01:26:32.602 --> 01:26:34.227
I am the one!

01:26:37.106 --> 01:26:38.273
Okay?

01:26:51.871 --> 01:26:53.079
Okay.

01:26:53.164 --> 01:26:54.789
Help me push.

01:26:58.127 --> 01:27:04.299
Hello?

01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:14.537
Papa.

01:28:16.707 --> 01:28:19.917
- What? What do you got there?
- Look.

01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:23.129
- What is it?
- It's a beetle.

01:28:24.756 --> 01:28:25.966
Look.

01:28:32.598 --> 01:28:33.932
Get down!

01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:40.480
Papa!

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.232
Son of a bitch!

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:55.370
No. No! Papa!

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:22.106
Cock-sucking motherfucker!

01:29:23.317 --> 01:29:24.817
Who else is here?

01:29:24.902 --> 01:29:27.028
You piece of shit!

01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:28.696
Why are you following us?

01:29:28.781 --> 01:29:31.115
We weren't following anybody.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:34.744
You were following us.

01:30:22.543 --> 01:30:24.043
Right there.

01:30:27.256 --> 01:30:29.382
Right there. Right there.

01:30:32.511 --> 01:30:33.678
Fuck.

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:12.759
Wait.

01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:28.734
No.

01:31:37.243 --> 01:31:39.161
We have to leave it.

01:31:41.206 --> 01:31:43.123
I can't do it anymore.

01:32:15.156 --> 01:32:16.823
jlf jl were God,

01:32:18.368 --> 01:32:20.994
I would've made the world just so,

01:32:23.039 --> 01:32:24.790
and no different.

01:32:29.337 --> 01:32:31.296
And so I have you.

01:32:37.595 --> 01:32:39.054
I have you.

01:33:43.162 --> 01:33:57.133
You're okay.

01:33:57.843 --> 01:34:00.219
Don't get too comfortable here.

01:34:00.971 --> 01:34:02.930
You need to keep going.

01:34:06.935 --> 01:34:09.687
You don't know
what might be down the road.

01:34:09.772 --> 01:34:10.980
No.

01:34:11.231 --> 01:34:13.650
No, you're gonna be okay, Papa.

01:34:13.734 --> 01:34:16.903
- You have to.
- This has been a long time coming.

01:34:21.742 --> 01:34:24.370
Just keep... Just keep going south.

01:34:27.123 --> 01:34:29.583
Do everything the way we did it.

01:34:30.543 --> 01:34:32.044
Keep the gun

01:34:32.712 --> 01:34:34.380
with you, always.

01:34:35.757 --> 01:34:38.258
Don't let anyone take it from you.

01:34:42.222 --> 01:34:46.725
You need to find the good guys,
but you can't take any chances.

01:34:47.936 --> 01:34:49.436
You hear me?

01:34:51.481 --> 01:34:53.607
But I want to be with you.

01:34:55.944 --> 01:34:58.112
I want to be with you, too,

01:34:58.738 --> 01:35:00.197
but I can't.

01:35:00.615 --> 01:35:03.283
You have to... You have to let me go.

01:35:04.119 --> 01:35:05.244
No.

01:35:06.371 --> 01:35:08.580
Just take me with you,

01:35:09.332 --> 01:35:10.624
please.

01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:15.879
I thought I could.

01:35:17.632 --> 01:35:19.675
- Please, Papa.
- I can't do it.

01:35:19.801 --> 01:35:21.552
What should I do?

01:35:21.636 --> 01:35:23.762
Just hold my hand.

01:35:28.518 --> 01:35:30.936
You said you wouldn't leave me.

01:35:34.274 --> 01:35:35.566
I know.

01:35:37.902 --> 01:35:39.361
I'm sorry.

01:35:43.908 --> 01:35:45.325
Oh, my boy.

01:35:46.119 --> 01:35:47.369
My boy.

01:35:51.124 --> 01:35:53.125
You have my whole heart.

01:35:55.795 --> 01:35:57.421
You always did.

01:36:38.798 --> 01:36:39.923
Papa.

01:36:45.304 --> 01:36:46.429
No.

01:36:49.517 --> 01:36:56.439
Papa.

01:39:23.965 --> 01:39:26.383
Where's that man you were with?

01:39:35.477 --> 01:39:37.228
Is he your father?

01:39:38.522 --> 01:39:41.023
Yes, he was my papa.

01:39:41.566 --> 01:39:44.318
I think maybe you should come with me.

01:39:49.574 --> 01:39:51.742
Are you one of the good guys?

01:39:51.827 --> 01:39:54.870
Yeah, I'm one of the good guys.
Why don't you put that pistol away?

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:59.000
I'm not supposed to let anyone
take it from me, no matter what.

01:39:59.084 --> 01:40:03.337
I don't want your pistol,
I just don't want you pointing it at me.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.103
You see, you got two choices here.

01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:23.774
You can stay here with your papa
or you can go with me.

01:40:25.569 --> 01:40:28.779
If you stay here,
you need to keep off the road.

01:40:34.119 --> 01:40:36.245
How do I know you're one of the good guys?

01:40:36.329 --> 01:40:39.331
You don't. You'll just have to take a shot.

01:40:46.965 --> 01:40:48.841
Do you have any kids?

01:40:50.427 --> 01:40:51.886
Yes, we do.

01:40:54.556 --> 01:40:56.640
Do you have a little boy?

01:40:57.350 --> 01:41:00.144
We have a little boy and a little girl.

01:41:00.812 --> 01:41:02.104
How old is he?

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:04.940
About your age, maybe a little older.

01:41:07.319 --> 01:41:09.403
And you didn't eat them?

01:41:09.905 --> 01:41:11.113
No.

01:41:12.158 --> 01:41:14.367
So, you don't eat people?

01:41:14.452 --> 01:41:16.536
No, we don't eat people.

01:41:19.832 --> 01:41:20.999
And

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:24.544
are you carrying the fire?

01:41:25.338 --> 01:41:26.713
Am I what?

01:41:27.173 --> 01:41:28.924
Carrying the fire.

01:41:33.137 --> 01:41:35.388
You're kind of weirded out, aren't you, kid?

01:41:35.473 --> 01:41:37.349
Well, are you?

01:41:38.351 --> 01:41:40.519
Yeah, I'm carrying the fire.

01:41:41.521 --> 01:41:43.563
And I can come with you?

01:41:44.148 --> 01:41:45.690
Yes, you can.

01:42:06.754 --> 01:42:08.964
I'll talk to you every day.

01:42:13.052 --> 01:42:14.928
And I won't forget,

01:42:16.848 --> 01:42:18.515
no matter what.

01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:27.607
No matter what, Papa.

01:42:57.389 --> 01:42:59.307
I'm so glad to see you.

01:43:01.185 --> 01:43:03.936
We were following you. Did you know that?

01:43:05.564 --> 01:43:07.690
We saw you with your papa.

01:43:10.444 --> 01:43:12.111
I'm so lucky.

01:43:17.534 --> 01:43:19.702
I was so worried about you,

01:43:20.162 --> 01:43:23.206
and now we don't have to worry
about a thing.

01:43:25.167 --> 01:43:27.627
How's that sound? Is that okay?

01:43:45.145 --> 01:43:46.479
Okay.
