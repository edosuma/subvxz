00:00.301 --> 00:03.536
_

00:08.376 --> 00:10.059
<i>How many times
in the last year</i>

00:10.061 --> 00:11.977
<i>has the City of Yonkers</i>
<i>been in this courtroom</i>

00:11.979 --> 00:14.313
<i>at the brink of a crisis</i>
<i>of its own making?</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:16.816
Three? Four?

00:16.818 --> 00:19.702
This case was decided
over two years ago.

00:19.704 --> 00:21.987
This court issued its remedy
order 18 months ago.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.906
To vote in favor
of the overall remedy,

00:23.908 --> 00:27.209
as the Yonkers City Council
has finally managed to do,

00:27.211 --> 00:29.578
is insufficient.

00:29.580 --> 00:31.831
Yonkers must approve a plan
to build specific houses

00:31.833 --> 00:33.582
at specific locations. _

00:33.584 --> 00:36.836
If Yonkers officials continue
to ignore this court's order

00:36.838 --> 00:40.806
and by 4:30 Thursday do not approve
200 units of public housing

00:40.808 --> 00:42.675
to be built
at specific locations

00:42.677 --> 00:45.311
east of the Saw Mill
River Parkway,

00:45.313 --> 00:47.429
I will find the City of
Yonkers in contempt.

00:47.431 --> 00:50.149
<i>In addition, I will
impose a daily fine,</i>

00:50.151 --> 00:52.101
<i>beginning at $100</i>
<i>the first day</i>

00:52.103 --> 00:54.019
<i>and doubling every day</i>
<i>thereafter</i>

00:54.021 --> 00:56.055
<i>until Yonkers is bankrupt.</i>

00:56.057 --> 00:58.724
This is the moment
of truth, gentlemen.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.944
Your Honor, I'd like
to request a recess

01:01.946 --> 01:03.863
so I can confer
with my client.

01:03.865 --> 01:05.364
Well, it's approaching
lunchtime.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.583
Why don't we reconvene
at 2:00?

01:07.585 --> 01:09.869
Court stands in recess
until then.

01:09.871 --> 01:11.954
All rise.

01:19.714 --> 01:22.715
- You can see we've worked his last nerve.
- Yeah.

01:22.717 --> 01:25.134
We don't have
any slack here.

01:25.136 --> 01:28.304
- Gentlemen, enjoy your lunch.
- You, too.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.557
You know,
to hell with him.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.442
We appeal again.
We go to the Supreme Court.

01:33.444 --> 01:34.894
Win or lose,
we take our shot.

01:34.896 --> 01:36.362
Councilman Longo,
what the fuck?

01:36.364 --> 01:38.564
I know, but there's got
to be a way out of this.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.566
This goddamn judge, he's
shoving it so far up my ass,

01:40.568 --> 01:42.368
- I can feel it in my throat, Nick.
- Neil, he starts--

01:42.370 --> 01:43.986
he starts fining us
100 bucks

01:43.988 --> 01:46.238
and doubles it every day,
when do we start hurting?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.874
The entire city operating budget
is just under 300 million.

01:48.876 --> 01:52.995
So working backwards,
we exceed that on...

01:56.250 --> 01:57.750
...day 22.

01:57.752 --> 01:59.752
<i>Clear enough, guys?</i>

01:59.754 --> 02:01.837
In three weeks, the City
of Yonkers goes bankrupt.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.391
<i>Fuck.</i>

02:12.984 --> 02:14.984
At last,
they see the light?

02:14.986 --> 02:17.603
Sand was breathing fire
in there.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.939
Now they're singed.

02:19.941 --> 02:21.991
Once they cross
the Triborough,

02:21.993 --> 02:23.742
a little north of the Bronx,

02:23.744 --> 02:25.444
this thing,
it becomes a lot less real.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.280
It's like a bad dream
to these guys,

02:28.282 --> 02:32.117
and they'll tell each other,
"It'll all be okay somehow."

02:32.119 --> 02:34.119
The good white folk
of Yonkers

02:34.121 --> 02:36.121
give 'em a slap
on the back and tell 'em,

02:36.123 --> 02:40.793
"You be courageous, stand up to
those blacks, those Jew lawyers,

02:40.795 --> 02:42.428
goddamn liberal judges."

02:42.430 --> 02:43.929
Ah.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.632
- What?
- Hey.

02:46.634 --> 02:50.519
I know, it just--
this case.

02:50.521 --> 02:53.188
I swear, every time I worry
I'm getting too cynical,

02:53.190 --> 02:56.141
I see I'm not even
keeping pace.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.445
What do you think
of the new mayor?

02:59.447 --> 03:00.729
- The kid?
- Yeah.

03:02.817 --> 03:05.451
- I'll meet you there.
- All right, okay.

03:05.453 --> 03:08.070
This is gonna eat him up.

<i>Ah, muchacho.</i>

03:58.089 --> 04:01.457
One cookie each, please!

04:09.383 --> 04:11.717
Roberto, don't let them
ride in the street, please.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.385
Yes, Mom.

04:14.689 --> 04:17.890
Hey, guys, don't ride
in the street!

04:19.442 --> 04:22.060
Carmen, here they're all
in the street.

04:22.063 --> 04:23.812
I know, but if I pretend
to yell at them about that,

04:23.814 --> 04:25.564
they won't ride
on the <i> avenida.</i>

04:25.566 --> 04:28.484
Es verdad.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.457
I still don't understand why we can't
appeal the Second Circuit decision.

04:35.459 --> 04:38.043
You can. But you don't really
have a leg to stand on

04:38.045 --> 04:39.828
and there are no
constitutional grounds.

04:39.830 --> 04:42.081
- But we could appeal, technically.
<i>- And lose.</i>

04:42.083 --> 04:43.916
<i>Maybe the full Circuit</i>
<i>isn't as liberal</i>

04:43.918 --> 04:45.751
as the three who handed
down this decision.

04:45.753 --> 04:49.054
- Maybe. - Judges Pratt and Miner
were Reagan appointees.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.222
We lost on the merits.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.890
Look, here and now,
you guys need to make

04:51.892 --> 04:54.009
a good faith effort
to comply with Sand.

04:54.011 --> 04:56.979
<i>Come up with a plan you can
live with and stick to it.</i>

04:56.981 --> 04:59.264
I think the judge is pretty much
wedded to the four School sites.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.568
You know, the School 30 site is right
behind my house over by Nevada Avenue.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.436
And I already got a site
in my district.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.437
Don't look at me.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.605
I already ate
the Walt Whitman School site.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.689
Yeah, you know what?
I got news for you.

05:07.691 --> 05:09.074
All right, we're gonna
lose Nevada Avenue

05:09.076 --> 05:10.576
or we got no deal.

05:10.578 --> 05:13.746
If I have to, I could live
with a small site, you know,

05:13.748 --> 05:15.948
down on Midland,
over by Sarah Lawrence,

05:15.950 --> 05:17.950
but not, you know,
in my backyard.

05:17.952 --> 05:22.004
You did not just--

05:22.006 --> 05:23.622
That is actually
my backyard.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.708
Look, this train's
left the station.

05:26.710 --> 05:29.128
We're your lawyers. We're just
trying to prevent a wreck.

05:29.130 --> 05:31.213
<i>If we do it now,
early in the term,</i>

05:31.215 --> 05:33.966
it'll get hot for a while, but it'll
cool down before the next election.

05:33.968 --> 05:36.135
Jesus, this is a bitch.

05:36.137 --> 05:39.471
Hey, it's what they pay us
the big bucks for, right?

05:42.276 --> 05:44.226
She said we could
stay here till the baby comes.

05:46.030 --> 05:48.781
She's cool with it.
You'll see.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.983
Never been over
this way before.

05:50.985 --> 05:54.653
Yeah, well, they built
Mulford a long time back.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.872
When they opened it,
it was all white people.

05:56.874 --> 06:00.209
When Gammy moved in, it was
still mostly white people.

06:00.211 --> 06:03.495
You know we're gonna need more
than one room when the baby comes.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.130
Look, we ain't gonna
be here forever.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.170
Now, what you doin'?
You ain't gonna help out?

06:11.172 --> 06:14.807
No, I like a man
carrying stuff for me.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.308
- You like this, huh?
- Yeah.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.726
Oh, okay.

06:17.728 --> 06:19.178
Check this out.

06:19.180 --> 06:21.180
Whoo!

06:21.182 --> 06:23.565
- Yeah, baby.
- Ooh, watch out.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.235
Damn, boy.

06:26.237 --> 06:27.769
- Whoo.
- Baby.

06:31.575 --> 06:33.692
You got it.
You like that?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.360
Good job, babe.

06:37.114 --> 06:39.615
Please be seated.

06:42.620 --> 06:44.536
- Mr. McAmis?
- Your Honor.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.923
The City of Yonkers understands
the gravity of the situation.

06:47.925 --> 06:49.791
After conferring
for the past four hours,

06:49.793 --> 06:51.210
the mayor
and council majority here

06:51.212 --> 06:53.545
have agreed to meet
in a special session tomorrow

06:53.547 --> 06:57.933
<i>to approve a plan of 200 units of
public housing at specific sites.</i>

06:57.935 --> 07:00.185
In addition, Your Honor,
Mayor Wasicsko,

07:00.187 --> 07:03.222
himself a member of the bar,
would like to address the court.

07:03.224 --> 07:05.858
Very well.
Mr. Mayor?

07:08.312 --> 07:10.395
Thank you, Your Honor.

07:10.397 --> 07:14.066
Um, Your Honor, a majority
of the Yonkers City Council

07:14.068 --> 07:16.235
supports making
the housing commitment

07:16.237 --> 07:18.403
and negotiating
a building plan,

07:18.405 --> 07:20.455
and I just
want to assure you

07:20.457 --> 07:23.075
that the city
will obey the law.

07:23.077 --> 07:26.078
Well, I appreciate that,
Mayor Wasicsko, I do.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.581
But let me say this-- we have
been here before with Yonkers.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.416
Four years ago
and six years ago

07:31.418 --> 07:33.802
we came to the brink of a
settlement in this case

07:33.804 --> 07:36.004
before the City Council
balked at building

07:36.006 --> 07:37.890
<i>even a single unit</i>
<i>of low-income housing.</i>

07:37.892 --> 07:41.059
<i>In light of that, the council
must approve a housing plan</i>

07:41.061 --> 07:43.395
that includes specific,
named site locations

07:43.397 --> 07:45.430
where the 200 units
will be built

07:45.432 --> 07:47.232
and a construction
timetable

07:47.234 --> 07:50.485
and do so by 10:00 AM
next Monday.

07:50.487 --> 07:51.820
Yes, Your Honor.

07:51.822 --> 07:53.772
<i>Mr. McAmis, the
court will expect...</i>

07:53.774 --> 07:55.490
Goddamn sellout.

07:55.492 --> 07:57.492
<i>...immediately following</i>
<i>the council vote.</i>

07:57.494 --> 07:59.111
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

07:59.113 --> 08:02.748
Yonkers officials agreed to comply
with the federal desegregation order

08:02.750 --> 08:05.500
<i>after the judge threatened fines
that would bankrupt the city.</i>

08:05.502 --> 08:07.419
We are making
these concessions

08:07.421 --> 08:11.540
in order to save the city from
enormous fines and contempt.

08:11.542 --> 08:12.624
<i>But even opponents...</i>

08:12.626 --> 08:14.042
They talking about
building those here?

08:14.044 --> 08:15.427
I think so.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.629
We were double-crossed by the
councilmen in there today.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.799
They promised people they
wouldn't give in and they folded.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.135
<i>And city officials must
still identify specific sites...</i>

08:23.137 --> 08:24.770
- Did you pick up--
- Shh, please.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.022
<i>...for another deadline</i>
<i>set by the judge.</i>

08:27.024 --> 08:29.224
I think we'll have a resolution
by Monday one way or the other.

08:29.226 --> 08:32.894
Now, there are some proposed sites
that are still on the table,

08:32.895 --> 08:35.030
but the ball is squarely
in the City of Yonkers' court.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.567
<i>I'm Virginia Kim,
Cablevision News, Westchester.</i>

08:38.568 --> 08:40.235
Chicken's overcooked
again, isn't it?

08:40.236 --> 08:41.903
<i>Turning to
sports, the New York Knicks</i>

08:41.905 --> 08:43.455
<i>take on the Cleveland</i>
<i>Cavaliers tonight...</i>

08:43.457 --> 08:44.990
Buddy?

08:44.992 --> 08:46.825
<i>The Knicks have had big trouble
on the road this year...</i>

08:46.827 --> 08:48.327
No, it's fine.

08:48.329 --> 08:50.879
It's real--
it's great, actually.

08:50.881 --> 08:54.383
So Martinelli
was right.

08:54.385 --> 08:56.385
About the housing?

08:56.387 --> 08:58.804
Yeah,
about the housing.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.673
He said we had to build
it, and guess what?

09:01.675 --> 09:04.009
We gotta build it.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.479
It's just an appeal
is a waste of money.

09:07.481 --> 09:10.682
I mean, there's no getting
around this goddamned judge.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.185
You didn't know all that
when you ran against him.

09:13.187 --> 09:15.854
Right?

09:18.409 --> 09:21.777
I don't know. Maybe I
didn't want to know.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.417
You know what?
We can get past this.

09:28.419 --> 09:32.037
We can. I just got to, uh,
get everybody on board,

09:32.039 --> 09:36.675
convince the rest of the council
that the law is the law.

09:39.013 --> 09:42.714
I think you're gonna
be a great mayor.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.433
Yeah?

09:44.435 --> 09:46.635
I think so.

09:46.637 --> 09:49.054
<i>♪ I just want to say ♪</i>

09:49.056 --> 09:52.557
<i>♪ this is my way</i>
<i>of telling you... ♪</i>

09:52.559 --> 09:53.892
<i>You weren't there.</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:55.110
<i>You don't know how angry</i>
<i>this judge is.</i>

09:55.112 --> 09:57.362
Oh, he's angry?
He ain't the only one.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.282
I'm for taking this to the Supreme
Court, appealing all the way.

10:00.284 --> 10:03.652
Councilman, we don't have a
chance before the Supreme Court.

10:03.654 --> 10:05.570
We need to offer them
a housing plan--

10:05.572 --> 10:07.372
A housing plan? Sure.
Here's my housing plan.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.291
No low-income housing.

10:09.293 --> 10:10.826
If they can afford
a house, great.

10:10.828 --> 10:12.577
- If not--
- We're past that, Hank.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.913
That argument was heard
and it lost.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.549
If we don't offer a plan,
the judge is gonna hold

10:17.551 --> 10:19.885
<i>the city, all of us,</i>
<i>in contempt.</i>

10:19.887 --> 10:21.586
He can fine us,
jail us--

10:21.588 --> 10:24.139
This judge ain't the Pope.
We're talking due process here.

10:24.141 --> 10:27.759
All right, sit down, Hank. Let's agree
on something we can all support.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.311
I ain't supporting
nothing.

10:34.651 --> 10:35.901
He's not
supporting nothing?

10:35.903 --> 10:37.686
Oh, God.

10:37.688 --> 10:39.988
Well, as we've
been intimating,

10:39.990 --> 10:43.024
Mr. Spallone's just doubled the number
of housing units coming to his district.

10:43.026 --> 10:44.659
What a gaping asshole.

10:44.661 --> 10:46.828
Hank's gonna grandstand
the shit out of this.

10:46.830 --> 10:48.447
No, Daddy.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.452
No, no, she was here
this morning,

10:53.454 --> 10:55.620
but I think she
went to, um--

10:55.622 --> 10:57.956
she went to work
this afternoon.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.625
- <i> Where?</i>
- Work. I think she went to work, Daddy.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.461
- <i> All right.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.798
If I see her,
I sure will.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.300
<i>All right, then.</i>

11:08.302 --> 11:09.551
All right.
Love to Mama.

11:09.553 --> 11:11.636
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Love you.</i>

11:12.806 --> 11:14.940
I don't like
lying to him.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.641
Hey, Skip.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.026
Hey, what's up?

11:21.031 --> 11:22.114
Breakout down.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.698
You making money
today, ain't ya?

11:23.700 --> 11:26.118
As long as the young'un
ain't fucked the count up.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.203
Who?

11:28.205 --> 11:30.155
Dante.
Boy in the blue.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.624
- He been fucking up, huh?
- Every goddamn day.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.916
<i>Oh, shit. 5-0 checking.</i>

11:40.918 --> 11:42.968
They're hitting up
Frankie's crew.

11:42.970 --> 11:46.555
I said turn around!
Turn around!

11:46.557 --> 11:48.890
Yo, I'm paying this motherfucker
over here to be the lookout

11:48.892 --> 11:52.344
<i>and he got his fucking hand in his
pocket rubbing his goddamned nuts.</i>

11:52.346 --> 11:54.846
Shit.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.851
Yo, pick it up and go.
Casual.

12:03.407 --> 12:05.690
Ignorant motherfucker.
Pick it up.

12:07.744 --> 12:09.694
Pick my shit up.
Now.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.117
God damn!
What the--

12:20.040 --> 12:23.041
Hey!
Hey, you, freeze!

12:23.043 --> 12:24.926
5-0 on you, Skip.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.551
Yo, yo, yo!

12:43.947 --> 12:46.615
Run back, tell my
sister to dial 911.

12:46.617 --> 12:47.899
No.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.568
You can't breathe!

12:49.570 --> 12:52.904
You call an ambo and the
police are gonna come with.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.709
Just let me be.

13:14.978 --> 13:17.062
There's my girl.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.480
Hey.

13:18.482 --> 13:20.732
Hey, how's
the Bronxville Bomber?

13:20.734 --> 13:22.817
- Huh?
- Oh.

13:22.819 --> 13:24.486
Thanks for coming out.

13:24.488 --> 13:26.488
You sounded
pretty down, Vinni.

13:26.490 --> 13:28.773
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.

13:28.775 --> 13:34.079
I just, uh--
I felt like I--

13:34.081 --> 13:36.281
I just needed
to talk to someone.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.916
Someone other
than myself.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.118
Hi.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.121
- A Stoli and tonic with
a twist of lime, please. - Sure.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.290
- Another one of those?
- Uh, yeah. Just no lime.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.959
- Menus?
- No, thank you.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.545
- Uh...
- What's going on?

13:50.547 --> 13:53.965
I don't know.
I just, uh--

13:53.967 --> 13:57.802
I'm just feeling
a little lost.

13:57.804 --> 14:02.774
Adrift, maybe, just
being out so suddenly.

14:02.776 --> 14:06.444
Right. Well, you're working at
the photography shop, right?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.146
- Yeah.
- Family is...?

14:08.148 --> 14:10.065
Yeah, good.
You know.

14:10.067 --> 14:12.484
Yeah?

14:12.486 --> 14:13.985
It's different.

14:13.987 --> 14:17.656
It's like,
when you're out of office,

14:17.658 --> 14:21.626
it's like your candle
goes out, you know?

14:21.628 --> 14:25.664
And everyone just moves on
to the next candle.

14:25.666 --> 14:28.249
And, uh...

14:28.251 --> 14:30.051
people stop calling

14:30.053 --> 14:33.421
and reporters
stop trying to reach you

14:33.423 --> 14:36.174
and, uh...

14:36.176 --> 14:38.476
it's back to your life.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.345
Yeah.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.064
But you're reading the paper
and you're watching TV,

14:43.066 --> 14:45.984
- so you know what's going on.
- You know what?

14:45.986 --> 14:48.687
I think you might've been the
lucky one in this situation

14:48.689 --> 14:51.323
because this
housing shit...

14:51.325 --> 14:55.076
the judge,
Spallone, Longo...

14:55.078 --> 14:57.829
Oh, fuck Nick Longo.
He should get ass cancer.

14:57.831 --> 14:59.948
Shit.

14:59.950 --> 15:04.202
Well, I definitely would prefer
you in that seat than him,

15:04.204 --> 15:07.956
but what are you-- what are we gonna do?
They redistricted us.

15:07.958 --> 15:09.708
From 12 seats
down to six, you know?

15:09.710 --> 15:11.459
Some of us
were gonna fall.

15:11.461 --> 15:15.213
Yeah, but...

15:15.215 --> 15:17.349
it hurts to lose.

15:18.969 --> 15:20.719
You tell yourself
it's not personal, but...

15:20.721 --> 15:23.271
Right.

15:23.273 --> 15:24.689
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.641
Thanks.
Ahem.

15:26.643 --> 15:28.610
Yeah, I know.

15:28.612 --> 15:30.195
I have my family,

15:30.197 --> 15:33.314
I have a phenomenal
relationship with my kids.

15:33.316 --> 15:35.700
I love them to death.

15:35.702 --> 15:40.038
<i>But, uh, the whole time</i>
<i>I'm thinking,</i>

15:40.040 --> 15:43.241
"My God, there's a whole
part of my life

15:43.243 --> 15:46.077
that's not gonna
be there anymore."

15:46.079 --> 15:48.296
It's just politics,
Vinni.

15:48.298 --> 15:51.583
It's addictive
is what it is.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.053
Once you get that taste
in your mouth,

15:55.055 --> 15:57.005
I mean...

16:00.727 --> 16:03.061
I've, uh--

16:03.063 --> 16:06.431
I've even thought...

16:11.822 --> 16:15.824
You can think some pretty dark
shit when they make you walk away.

16:18.779 --> 16:21.329
You're all right.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.166
You're all right.

16:25.168 --> 16:29.087
Yeah, how's Nay?
Good?

16:29.089 --> 16:30.588
Stressed.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.840
Yeah, me, too.

16:31.842 --> 16:34.175
Oh, you know,
I miss the stress.

16:34.177 --> 16:36.678
- Yeah, well...
- Give me your stress.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.880
I want the stress.

16:40.383 --> 16:42.183
All right, just get Nevada
Avenue off the goddamn list.

16:42.185 --> 16:43.551
All right?
That's all I'm asking.

16:43.553 --> 16:45.770
Well, look at the fucking
seminary, then.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.305
- St. Joseph's?
- Yes.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.474
What-- didn't we already object to
that in the earlier court filings?

16:49.476 --> 16:50.775
Yeah, well, that was then,
this is now.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.311
I could talk to the
cardinal about it.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.613
I'm on the boards of St. Patrick's
and Catholic Charities.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.816
- I see him enough.
- Wait, wait, wait. You really think?

16:57.818 --> 16:59.400
Look, let's just put it down
as tentative for now.

16:59.402 --> 17:01.236
- Fine.
- Judge, you'll talk to the cardinal?

17:01.238 --> 17:04.038
- Yes.
- Okay, well, that's one site down, maybe.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.156
<i>- That's a start.</i>
<i>- Seven to go.</i>

17:07.410 --> 17:10.507
_

17:20.339 --> 17:22.307
Oh, my God.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.264
"You won't see
the next one."

17:29.266 --> 17:30.982
Oh, Jesus.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.859
Mine's bigger.

17:40.861 --> 17:43.411
Hey, you get yours yet?

17:43.413 --> 17:45.280
My bullet?
Yep.

17:45.282 --> 17:46.498
You see
that guy over there?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.032
That's your new
best friend, Nick.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.834
He's gonna follow you home
after the meeting,

17:49.836 --> 17:52.203
stay outside your house, and
follow you back to work tomorrow.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.923
- Round the clock.
- Well, I feel so special.

17:54.925 --> 17:57.091
You're not. The other
good-vote council members

17:57.093 --> 17:58.793
get police escorts, too.

17:58.795 --> 18:01.880
For everybody else, tomorrow
we put in metal detectors.

18:01.882 --> 18:04.549
All visitors start
signing in and out.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.519
Hey, this mayor thing?
When's the fun part start?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.805
Okay.

18:13.143 --> 18:15.933
- 260.
- 260?

18:15.934 --> 18:17.741
That much?

18:17.742 --> 18:21.607
25 each of these, 75.

18:21.608 --> 18:24.614
Plus 45,

18:24.615 --> 18:27.821
four of these for 15.60,

18:27.822 --> 18:28.822
and the chicken, 80.

18:28.823 --> 18:30.845
260.

18:30.846 --> 18:33.072
Okay.

18:37.751 --> 18:39.500
Leave this,
I'll pay for the rest.

18:39.502 --> 18:41.836
Okay.

18:46.364 --> 18:48.099
165.

18:52.399 --> 18:53.765
Maria.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.936
But I want candy.

18:57.938 --> 18:59.654
We have at home.

19:07.897 --> 19:11.115
And finally
the last site

19:11.117 --> 19:15.119
would be at Midland
and Theresa Avenues,

19:15.121 --> 19:18.823
making for a total of seven
agreed-upon sites, so--

19:18.825 --> 19:20.458
Cardinal's on the line,
Your Honor.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.543
Thank you.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.467
Your Eminence,
Judge Sand here.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.002
Good morning.
How are you?

19:31.004 --> 19:32.804
<i>Just fine, Judge.
And you?</i>

19:32.806 --> 19:36.007
Very good. I have here in chambers
lawyers for the City of Yonkers

19:36.009 --> 19:38.392
and from the Department
of Justice and the NAACP.

19:38.394 --> 19:41.229
I just want to make sure
we all understand each other.

19:41.231 --> 19:43.598
<i>Certainly, Judge Sand.</i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>

19:43.600 --> 19:45.900
The city's lawyers,
Judge Mulligan among them,

19:45.902 --> 19:48.436
tell me that the archdiocese
has agreed to let the city

19:48.438 --> 19:50.488
build 16 low-income
housing units

19:50.490 --> 19:53.608
at St. Joseph's Seminary
off Valentine Street.

19:53.610 --> 19:57.111
<i>That's right. Bill and I have
talked about a sliver of the site</i>

19:57.113 --> 20:00.331
<i>for the housing and perhaps a
bit more for a playground.</i>

20:00.333 --> 20:02.700
I see, Your Eminence.
If you have a problem

20:02.702 --> 20:05.036
with this proposal--
a political problem--

20:05.038 --> 20:09.373
<i>Oh, no, no, I understand the
proposal and I'm prepared to do it.</i>

20:09.375 --> 20:10.791
<i>It's a help to the poor</i>

20:10.793 --> 20:13.261
<i>and consistent with the
mission of the archdiocese.</i>

20:13.263 --> 20:15.012
<i>Once everything's</i>
<i>finalized on your end,</i>

20:15.014 --> 20:17.431
<i>let us know and we'll</i>
<i>release a statement.</i>

20:17.433 --> 20:19.550
Will do, Your Eminence.
Thank you.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.385
- <i> Not at all.</i>
- We'll be in touch.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.189
Done.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.361
Wait, which one did
you say was Hobart again?

20:30.363 --> 20:35.199
Uh, 3F.
Right there.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.321
Yeah, that one.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.373
- Now, there.
- Yeah.

20:42.375 --> 20:46.410
That way I'll be able to tell
when you're not here to help me.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.880
Yeah, I got practice
Tuesday at the rec.

20:48.882 --> 20:52.250
You know, I could miss it, but that'd
mean I'd have to quit the team.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.668
No, no, no, no.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.386
I'll make do
on Tuesday.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.255
All right.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.507
Can you wait on me?

21:01.644 --> 21:04.762
Jesus Christ, did you
read this quote from Fagan?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.097
About the judge?

21:07.934 --> 21:10.518
If I knew you'd
be so little help,

21:10.520 --> 21:13.854
I would never have agreed
to move in with you.

21:13.856 --> 21:16.357
I put the bed together.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.159
What else do you and me
need in a new apartment?

21:19.746 --> 21:22.697
If my father heard you talk
like that, he'd kill you twice.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.284
Yeah, he's already
mad at me,

21:26.286 --> 21:28.502
moving in with a guy
and no ring on my finger.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.922
Ah, I'll win him over
like any other constituent.

21:30.924 --> 21:32.206
You'll see.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.625
<i>♪ now, some may want to die,</i>
<i>young man... ♪</i>

21:34.627 --> 21:37.628
You should come to bed.
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.467
Tomorrow
is gonna be hell.

21:43.469 --> 21:48.389
<i>♪ hey, buddy,</i>
<i>that ain't me... ♪</i>

21:48.391 --> 21:51.392
<i>That's-- that's--</i>

21:51.394 --> 21:55.613
that's the only plan
that makes sense for the city.

21:55.615 --> 21:59.033
Thank you, Councilman.
Mr. Spallone?

21:59.035 --> 22:01.986
You know, I'm not like these
wimps who are kowtowing

22:01.988 --> 22:04.488
to some judge who's off
the friggin' wall.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.660
I'm not wearing Pampers.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.496
I swore an allegiance
to you, the voters,

22:12.498 --> 22:15.049
and I'm gonna keep that
allegiance to you,

22:15.051 --> 22:17.635
and I got a message
for Judge Sands.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.137
Nuts to Judge Sands.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.672
You wanna take me away?

22:21.674 --> 22:24.976
Come get me!

22:24.978 --> 22:28.095
Great, we're one wing nut
away from a riot.

22:28.097 --> 22:32.483
Tell me about it. They confiscated
four guns at the door.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.852
I wonder which one of these
bastards sent the bullets.

22:37.740 --> 22:42.493
Uh, we're here to take testimony
from the citizens of Yonkers...

22:44.364 --> 22:46.998
...regarding
the housing site plan.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.202
Those who have signed up
and wish to make a statement

22:51.204 --> 22:55.122
may proceed to the podium
in the proper order.

22:55.124 --> 22:58.459
What I'd like to know is whatever
happened to majority rule, huh?

22:58.461 --> 23:01.212
- Yeah!
- Isn't this still America?

23:01.214 --> 23:05.800
- Yeah!
<i>- A bunch of wimps is what you all are!</i>

23:05.802 --> 23:08.052
It's about these
public housing people

23:08.054 --> 23:12.056
<i>bringing drugs and crime</i>
<i>into our neighborhood</i>

23:12.058 --> 23:16.027
and ruining
our property values!

23:16.029 --> 23:18.229
- You promised us an appeal!
- Yes!

23:18.231 --> 23:20.147
You promised
you wouldn't settle!

23:20.149 --> 23:24.285
You have succeeded in raping
the voters of their city!

23:26.906 --> 23:29.573
You people campaigned
on this issue.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.710
I knocked on doors
for you, Nick Longo.

23:32.712 --> 23:37.298
<i>And you, Ed Fagan, you
said, "I will go to jail."</i>

23:37.300 --> 23:39.750
<i>You're not even</i>
<i>a man of your word.</i>

23:39.752 --> 23:41.085
<i>You know,</i>
<i>we're gonna find out.</i>

23:41.087 --> 23:44.255
We're gonna find out
what deal was done

23:44.257 --> 23:47.391
and I think you're gonna regret
the day you went into politics.

23:47.393 --> 23:52.063
So enjoy the next
two years on the council!

23:52.065 --> 23:54.765
They're your last
two years!

23:54.767 --> 23:55.900
<i>Shame on you!</i>

23:55.902 --> 23:57.518
<i>You should be ashamed</i>
<i>of yourselves!</i>

23:57.520 --> 23:59.437
I'd like to remind
the speakers

23:59.439 --> 24:01.439
to be respectful
of the people up here.

24:01.441 --> 24:05.276
<i>Where's our respect?
No more lies!</i>

24:05.278 --> 24:09.029
No more lies!
No more lies!

24:09.031 --> 24:12.116
<i>No more lies! No more lies!</i>

24:12.118 --> 24:14.335
<i>No more lies!</i>

24:14.337 --> 24:17.788
Yet officials say approval of
eight East Yonkers housing sites

24:17.790 --> 24:19.790
by the council
is inevitable

24:19.792 --> 24:22.927
despite the near unanimous
objections of Yonkers residents,

24:22.929 --> 24:26.464
<i>hundreds of whom turned out tonight
to register their displeasure.</i>

24:26.466 --> 24:28.432
They're really
gonna build them.

24:28.434 --> 24:32.219
Yeah, the paper said that the Loring
and Clark site is still on the list.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.021
And that's just a couple
of blocks from us.

24:34.023 --> 24:37.525
I mean, these people.

24:37.527 --> 24:40.311
They don't live
the way we do.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.481
They don't want
what we want.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.233
And their
neighborhoods...

24:46.235 --> 24:48.152
Yeah, a mess.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.988
Buddy, that's the last damn
meeting I'm going to miss.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.824
You mark my words.

24:53.826 --> 24:57.411
Majority rules in America,
but it can't rule contrary to law!

25:02.752 --> 25:05.920
Mr. Clerk,
roll call this vote.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.640
Mayor Wasicsko?

25:09.642 --> 25:11.509
Yes.

25:11.511 --> 25:13.227
<i>Vice Mayor Spallone.</i>

25:13.229 --> 25:14.979
No.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.648
- <i> Majority Leader Cola?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

25:17.650 --> 25:21.569
- <i> Minority Leader Longo?</i>
- Yes.

25:21.571 --> 25:24.104
- <i> Council Member Fagan?</i>
- Yes.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.357
<i>Mr. Chema?</i>

25:28.027 --> 25:30.694
<i>Mr. Chema?</i>

25:33.249 --> 25:36.584
- <i> Mr. Oxman?</i>
- Yes.

25:36.586 --> 25:39.370
<i>I have five
ayes, two nays.</i>

25:39.372 --> 25:40.337
<i>The measure passes!</i>

25:40.339 --> 25:42.373
Hey, please.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.624
What a waste of time.

25:43.626 --> 25:46.760
Sold us out! Sold us out!

25:46.762 --> 25:49.547
Sold us out!
Sold us out!

25:49.549 --> 25:52.132
Sold us out! Sold us out!

25:52.134 --> 25:54.351
I never thought
it could get this bad.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.436
Did you hear those people?

25:55.438 --> 25:57.805
Jesus Christ.

25:57.807 --> 25:59.056
What if we appeal
to the Supreme Court?

25:59.058 --> 26:00.357
What if we say
we're gonna appeal?

26:00.359 --> 26:02.142
There are no grounds, Nick.
The lawyers said so.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.361
- Fuck the lawyers.
- Fuck the lawyers?

26:04.363 --> 26:06.030
- Yeah.
- You got a law degree, right, Nick?

26:06.032 --> 26:07.481
Yeah, I got too much
pride to use it.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.366
Seriously, fuck
the fucking lawyers.

26:10.953 --> 26:13.204
Seriously, I don't see
how you guys can sit here

26:13.206 --> 26:16.991
going over it again
and again and again.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.792
I just want to go home.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.160
All right,
I'm right behind you.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.413
I need to
decompress, okay?

26:22.415 --> 26:26.000
I'm wired and exhausted
all at once.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.752
I get it.

26:28.754 --> 26:29.920
- I'll see you later.
- Be safe, okay?

26:29.922 --> 26:32.339
Yeah.

26:32.341 --> 26:36.510
<i>♪ oh, I wanna dance</i>
<i>with somebody... ♪</i>

26:36.512 --> 26:38.345
What's wrong with you?
Fuck the lawyers?

26:38.347 --> 26:40.898
Never. The lawyers
only fuck you.

26:40.900 --> 26:45.653
Yesterday they sent us a bill for
another $160,000 for last month,

26:45.655 --> 26:47.404
which means
we've already spent,

26:47.406 --> 26:49.323
what, $15 million
fighting this thing?

26:49.325 --> 26:52.159
Yeah, well, what's another
couple hundred thousand?

26:52.161 --> 26:53.944
Come on, Nick. When we
accepted the consent decree,

26:53.946 --> 26:56.196
we gave up
our right to appeal.

26:56.198 --> 26:59.116
You go to the Supreme Court now, you
piss off Judge Sand all over again.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.286
All right, so we don't appeal the
low-income housing part of the plan.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.837
That's done, fine.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.839
But we can still appeal the
affordable housing part, can't we?

27:05.841 --> 27:07.424
Right?

27:07.426 --> 27:08.792
That's the next
800 units

27:08.794 --> 27:11.295
that we're gonna have to
build after these sites.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.514
What?

27:13.516 --> 27:15.132
Would you rather take
your chances with Judge Sand

27:15.134 --> 27:20.187
or the good and angry people
of Yonkers, New York?

27:20.189 --> 27:22.856
Whoa, wait a minute.
Are you shitting me?

27:22.858 --> 27:25.059
- Maalox and Stoli?
- Yeah.

27:25.061 --> 27:26.477
I've never
seen anyone do that.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.811
Me neither, actually.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.731
<i>♪ I want to feel</i>
<i>the heat with somebody ♪</i>

27:30.733 --> 27:32.650
<i>♪ yeah, I wanna dance</i>

27:32.652 --> 27:34.318
- <i> Well?</i>
- I don't recommend it.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.124
Where does this go?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.493
That's extra.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.994
Extra?

27:43.996 --> 27:46.246
Yeah, you know they always
give you extra pieces.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.798
No, they don't always.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.216
For real, Skip,
we gotta do this right

27:49.218 --> 27:51.085
or the baby gonna be falling
through the slats or some shit.

27:51.087 --> 27:53.220
- Oh, my God.
<i>- This is serious.</i>

27:53.222 --> 27:56.090
It ain't funny. We got to assemble
this right or it's dangerous.

27:56.092 --> 27:58.058
All right,
just chill out.

27:58.060 --> 27:59.510
You want me
to call my father?

27:59.512 --> 28:00.511
He know how
to do shit right.

28:00.513 --> 28:03.347
No, you ain't gotta
call nobody.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.849
What, you don't think
I know how to be a daddy?

28:05.851 --> 28:09.236
Yo, as soon as this boy come
out, I'm going back to school.

28:09.238 --> 28:11.405
School? You?

28:11.407 --> 28:13.524
Yeah, me.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.993
Westchester CC.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.412
In the spring.

28:18.414 --> 28:21.699
I mean, I want
to quit now, but...

28:21.701 --> 28:25.169
I need the cash so I can
step back and do it right.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.840
What you gonna study?

28:29.842 --> 28:33.043
Something to get me hired.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.430
I don't know, maybe computers or some shit.
I don't know.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.384
You know, definitely
not construction.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.637
This shit ain't me, man.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.556
- It's not you, babe.
- It's not me.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.107
But it's okay.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.529
<i>Felipe missed you.</i>

28:52.531 --> 28:55.532
That he and his father have this
time together is a good thing.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.151
I got the banana.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.119
Good boy.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.407
Well, he home now.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.576
And you, too.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.544
It's better for them
here, Javier,

29:07.546 --> 29:10.381
but I am killing myself.

29:10.383 --> 29:12.499
I'm working at the school
12 hours a day

29:12.501 --> 29:14.168
and I still can't keep up.

29:14.170 --> 29:16.470
Rent, electricity--

29:16.472 --> 29:19.256
it's cheaper than New York,
but not that cheap.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.643
And food. Food alone costs almost
as much as I make here in a week.

29:22.645 --> 29:24.228
But Felipe's happy, no?

29:24.230 --> 29:27.398
All your kids.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.768
Plus, your place
in New York is bad.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.236
So it's settled.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.405
What is settled?

29:34.407 --> 29:36.023
You raise my son here.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.609
- You didn't hear what I said?
- I heard what you said.

29:38.611 --> 29:41.195
- I can't believe you're saying it.
- Which part?

29:41.197 --> 29:44.364
The part about the money? 'Cause I
don't see you working 12 hours a day

29:44.366 --> 29:46.283
to put food in his mouth
and a roof over his head.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.335
That my fault, huh?

29:48.337 --> 29:50.537
That my fault?
Always my fault.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.173
Huh? You gonna leave your
kids here with a maid, huh?

29:53.175 --> 29:55.426
And you go back to America.
That's my fault?

29:55.428 --> 29:57.544
The maid knows them
a lot better than you do.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.379
Anyway, my mother
is just down the street.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.965
You're a bad mother.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.053
You're gonna leave your sons
here and you're gonna run away.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.195
You're not a father.

30:05.196 --> 30:07.506
Do you want Felipe
living with you?

30:07.507 --> 30:08.477
No.

30:08.478 --> 30:10.630
Then you have no say here.

30:10.665 --> 30:12.376
Felipe!

30:15.197 --> 30:18.615
Sand is dirt! Sand is dirt!

30:20.453 --> 30:21.985
Go ahead.

30:23.205 --> 30:25.322
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- That's their lawyer.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.324
- That's fucking Sussman!
- Excuse me, please.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.493
Hey, fuck you,
you son of a bitch!

30:29.495 --> 30:31.578
Thank you! Thank you!

30:31.580 --> 30:33.997
Uh, Michael Sussman,
lead council for the NAACP.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.166
- Not this door.
- What do you mean, not this door?

30:36.168 --> 30:38.385
They just-- they just told me
to come in the side door. I could get in.

30:38.387 --> 30:40.804
- That's what they just told me.
- You were told wrong.

30:40.806 --> 30:43.640
Look, Officer, I got
to get in there, okay?

30:43.642 --> 30:45.008
I got to be
in court tomorrow--

30:45.010 --> 30:46.643
depending on what they do
tonight be ready to argue

30:46.645 --> 30:48.345
that the council
be held in contempt.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.481
- I got to get--
- What can I tell you?

30:52.518 --> 30:54.234
You're really doing
an exemplary job, Officer.

30:54.236 --> 30:56.436
Really preserving the peace.
Thank you.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.191
Okay, I guess I'll just
have to use the front door.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.660
Officer of the court coming through.
Excuse me.

31:03.662 --> 31:06.780
Right. I'm not playing
this game, okay?

31:06.782 --> 31:08.866
I'm not playing this game.
Excuse me, sir.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.701
Please keep your hands--
thank you.

31:10.703 --> 31:13.453
Officer of the court coming through.
Excuse me.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.046
Look, I know
it sounds bad out there.

31:23.048 --> 31:26.133
I know what's
in your ears.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.936
But the vote tonight was specifically
requested by Judge Sand.

31:28.938 --> 31:33.223
Now, he's not yet asking
that we name more sites

31:33.225 --> 31:36.944
or even have a full plan
for affordable housing.

31:36.946 --> 31:40.814
What he is asking is that the council
affirm that we're still committed

31:40.816 --> 31:43.233
to the affordable housing
part of the settlement.

31:45.788 --> 31:47.871
And we have
to be committed.

31:47.873 --> 31:49.656
We agreed to it.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.661
Understood?

32:00.169 --> 32:02.803
Good.

32:02.805 --> 32:06.089
Appeal! Appeal! Appeal!

32:06.091 --> 32:08.175
Yeah, you bunch
of bums!

32:11.480 --> 32:14.565
- Oh, you!
- It's all right.

32:20.990 --> 32:23.774
The Yonkers City Council
is now in session.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.409
Mr. Clerk?

32:27.529 --> 32:30.447
- <i> Please take your seats.</i>
- Excuse me, may I? Thank you.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.783
<i>Will you please
take your seats?</i>

32:32.785 --> 32:35.035
This is my first meeting.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.955
What do you do with this?
Any idea?

32:37.957 --> 32:39.706
Here's your Pampers,
baby mayor!

32:43.262 --> 32:45.095
<i>Yeah, I'm
talking about you!</i>

32:46.799 --> 32:48.098
Hey!

32:48.100 --> 32:50.684
<i>Try this on for size!</i>

32:50.686 --> 32:52.853
<i>Remove him! What
are you waiting for?</i>

32:52.855 --> 32:55.639
Mr. Mayor, I think
this was meant for you.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.308
Thank you, Hank.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.401
We've had it with what
you're doing here!

33:07.403 --> 33:09.870
The hell with you!

33:09.872 --> 33:13.573
Officers, officers, could you
please take care of this?

33:13.575 --> 33:15.792
Don't you
build those projects!

33:15.794 --> 33:17.494
That's enough of you!

33:17.496 --> 33:19.579
<i>Officers.</i>

33:22.668 --> 33:26.053
Hey, I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving.

33:26.055 --> 33:28.005
You wanna carry me?

33:28.007 --> 33:29.473
Leave her alone!

33:29.475 --> 33:31.725
Don't you dare, Bobby.

33:31.727 --> 33:34.144
Don't you dare.
I know your mother.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.432
Don't you dare!

33:42.938 --> 33:46.323
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

33:46.325 --> 33:49.943
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare!

33:52.531 --> 33:55.615
As indicated
by our last vote,

33:55.617 --> 33:59.670
we elected to appeal the
affordable housing portion

33:59.672 --> 34:01.755
of the judge's order
to the Supreme Court,

34:01.757 --> 34:03.790
but the Supreme Court
has refused to--

34:03.792 --> 34:06.043
Appeal all of it,
you coward!

34:06.045 --> 34:09.262
Roll call, Mr. Clerk. Roll call.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.766
- Mayor Wasicsko?
- Aye.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.520
- Vice Mayor Spallone?
- <i> No.</i>

34:18.023 --> 34:21.608
- Majority Leader Cola?
- <i> No.</i>

34:21.610 --> 34:25.145
- Minority Leader Longo?
- <i> No.</i>

34:25.147 --> 34:28.899
- Council Member Fagan?
- <i> No.</i>

34:28.900 --> 34:32.202
- Council Member Chema?
- <i> No.</i>

34:32.204 --> 34:35.572
- Council Member Oxman?
- <i> Abstain.</i>

34:35.574 --> 34:37.290
<i>Pussy.</i>

34:37.292 --> 34:41.210
<i>I have one aye,
five nays, one abstention.</i>

34:41.213 --> 34:43.580
<i>The measure fails!</i>

34:43.581 --> 34:46.917
Meeting adjourned.

35:00.733 --> 35:03.517
<i>I wanna play.
When's it my turn?</i>

35:03.519 --> 35:05.519
You're six. You don't
know how to do anything.

35:05.521 --> 35:06.686
Next game.

35:06.688 --> 35:07.938
You always say,
"Next game."

35:07.940 --> 35:09.573
Guys...

35:09.575 --> 35:12.242
I have something
to tell you.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.944
This isn't gonna be easy
for any of us,

35:13.946 --> 35:16.113
but I have to go back
to New York soon.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.330
- What?
- No fair.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.282
No, you can't.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.668
Felipe.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.037
This is best.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.840
For you to be here while
I earn what I can there.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.843
Okay?

35:31.964 --> 35:34.014
Do you understand?

36:12.337 --> 36:15.172
<i>About 50 protesters
from the Save Yonkers Federation</i>

36:15.174 --> 36:17.808
<i>greeted New York's Cardinal
John O'Connor this afternoon</i>

36:17.810 --> 36:22.012
<i>when he rived at the gate of Saint
Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie.</i>

36:22.014 --> 36:24.681
<i>The group objects to the New
York Archdiocese's agreement</i>

36:24.683 --> 36:28.602
<i>to give some of the seminary's land to
the City of Yonkers for public housing.</i>

36:28.604 --> 36:31.354
<i>We're urging
Catholics all over the city,</i>

36:31.356 --> 36:33.907
<i>especially the parishioners</i>
<i>of St. John the Baptist,</i>

36:33.909 --> 36:37.020
to withhold their donations
from the church

36:37.021 --> 36:38.863
and from the cardinal's appeal.

36:38.898 --> 36:41.248
<i>He needs to remember</i>
<i>who the people are</i>

36:41.250 --> 36:43.333
<i>who are</i>
<i>in his archdiocese.</i>

36:46.672 --> 36:49.039
Prenatal clinic.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.462
Is there
a Doreen Henderson here?

36:55.464 --> 36:56.930
Me.

36:56.932 --> 37:00.717
<i>Miss Henderson,</i>
<i>I have a call for you.</i>

37:00.719 --> 37:02.185
For me?

37:03.138 --> 37:04.971
- Here?
- Mm.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.276
Hello?

37:39.391 --> 37:41.057
<i>Ahem.</i>

37:48.734 --> 37:52.319
Gammy found him in
the apartment in Mulford.

37:52.321 --> 37:55.772
My boy always
had trouble with that. Always.

37:57.109 --> 38:00.527
I never knew Skip to breathe
without a struggle.

38:07.085 --> 38:10.120
What are we going to do?

38:14.176 --> 38:16.459
Clerk will
call the roll...

38:18.297 --> 38:20.964
on the resolution
approving the plan

38:20.966 --> 38:23.883
for 800 units
of affordable housing

38:23.885 --> 38:26.136
to be built
on the specified sites.

38:26.138 --> 38:28.188
Ahem.

38:28.190 --> 38:30.690
On the resolution
approving the plan

38:30.692 --> 38:34.194
for 800 units to be built
on the specified sites.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.816
What are you doing?

38:39.818 --> 38:42.235
I'm practicing.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.905
I'm trying to do it
as dispassionately as I can.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.743
Just even voice and...

38:52.214 --> 38:55.332
no show of emotion.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.834
I just want 'em to see that it's
not getting to me, you know?

38:57.836 --> 39:00.337
Yeah?
How's it going?

39:00.339 --> 39:01.972
I think I'm getting
better at it.

39:01.974 --> 39:03.640
- Yeah?
- I think so.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.008
- Good.
- Yeah.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.726
Keep practicing.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.681
Clerk will call
the roll.

39:15.070 --> 39:16.987
- Ahem.
- Yeah.

39:16.989 --> 39:19.105
Clerk will
call the roll.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.694
Clerk will call...

39:24.696 --> 39:26.246
the roll.

39:29.167 --> 39:33.370
Clerk will
roll the call.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.596
- <i> Ma'am</i>
- <i> Thank you.</i>

39:58.196 --> 40:01.731
Are you okay, ma'am?

40:01.733 --> 40:04.200
My children.

40:04.201 --> 40:06.478
I miss them already.

40:06.479 --> 40:09.004
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

40:23.722 --> 40:26.339
Your nephew
can't come anymore?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.345
I'm going to miss you.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.315
I know, darling.

40:35.317 --> 40:38.151
Your eyes can't
get any better?

40:40.739 --> 40:43.490
No, Mr. Hobart,
they can't.

40:43.492 --> 40:45.992
Norma,
how old are you?

40:47.946 --> 40:50.947
I'm 47.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.449
You're still young.

40:52.451 --> 40:55.618
Am I?

40:57.506 --> 40:59.006
_

40:59.007 --> 41:00.623
Misled?

41:00.625 --> 41:02.876
Misled?
Look at this.

41:02.878 --> 41:05.545
"Too many people
of any category together

41:05.547 --> 41:07.464
can lead
to a ghetto situation"?

41:07.466 --> 41:08.765
Are you kidding me?

41:08.767 --> 41:11.267
Your Honor, I know we're
well past your deadline

41:11.269 --> 41:13.019
for approving the affordable
housing component,

41:13.021 --> 41:16.055
but the cardinal's turnaround has
the council marching backwards.

41:16.057 --> 41:18.274
They're asking for a new
vote on the consent decree.

41:18.276 --> 41:21.978
They're saying that your decision
is antireligion. Or anti-Catholic.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.148
Another Hebrew
plot exposed!

41:25.150 --> 41:28.618
Yonkers officials are obviously using
the cardinal's unfortunate retreat

41:28.620 --> 41:31.704
as a transparent ploy to get out
of the entire consent decree.

41:31.706 --> 41:34.958
And please tell
your mayor I said so.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.827
And where is
Mr. Wasicsko today?

41:37.829 --> 41:39.963
He's meeting with
our trial attorneys.

41:39.965 --> 41:42.799
Apparently, Cardinal O'Connor isn't
the only one with cold feet.

41:42.801 --> 41:45.301
Jesus Christ.

41:45.303 --> 41:47.554
Of course my firm has to
resign from the case.

41:47.556 --> 41:49.806
I mean, what choice
do we have?

41:49.808 --> 41:50.807
Our integrity's
been attacked.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.892
The entire law firm
has been attacked.

41:52.894 --> 41:55.929
I've been accused of misleading
the cardinal, for God's sake.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.148
Cigar?

41:59.684 --> 42:03.520
Cardinal O'Connor is actually
saying we bamboozled him,

42:03.522 --> 42:06.105
as if we tricked him
into offering land.

42:06.107 --> 42:08.858
Yeah, it's a dirty
business, huh?

42:11.196 --> 42:13.947
Nobody gets out clean,
do they?

42:15.700 --> 42:18.501
Gentlemen, I asked
for the council to affirm

42:18.503 --> 42:20.620
that Yonkers
still supports continuing

42:20.622 --> 42:22.705
with the second phase
of the court settlement--

42:22.707 --> 42:24.757
the affordable
housing plan--

42:24.759 --> 42:28.178
and the latest council action
signals the exact opposite.

42:28.180 --> 42:30.880
<i>So we are back</i>
<i>to the usual precipice.</i>

42:30.882 --> 42:33.383
<i>I'm setting next Monday</i>
<i>as a deadline for a vote</i>

42:33.385 --> 42:36.436
<i>in favor of enactment</i>
<i>of a full housing plan,</i>

42:36.438 --> 42:38.188
<i>including the affordable</i>
<i>housing component.</i>

42:38.190 --> 42:40.890
Should you not approve a plan by
then, you and the City of Yonkers

42:40.892 --> 42:44.694
will be in contempt of court
and fines will begin.

42:44.696 --> 42:48.898
In addition, anyone who fails
to vote in favor of enactment

42:48.900 --> 42:52.318
will be personally fined
$500 a day and imprisoned.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.070
<i>They'll be released</i>
<i>once a week</i>

42:54.072 --> 42:57.624
<i>to attend a council meeting and
consider changing their vote.</i>

42:57.626 --> 43:00.043
Gentlemen, our object

43:00.045 --> 43:03.213
is not to create
martyrs or heroes.

43:04.749 --> 43:07.250
Our object is to get
this housing built.

43:58.470 --> 44:01.304
Big night tonight, Pop.

44:01.306 --> 44:04.807
Judge is gonna give us
one more chance.

44:04.809 --> 44:08.528
Deuce hits the fan and we separate
the men from the shit talkers.

44:18.323 --> 44:21.491
Well, I don't think
I got the votes.

44:23.795 --> 44:27.046
The stuff they're gonna be
saying tonight,

44:27.048 --> 44:30.667
the shouting, the things
they're gonna call me...

44:39.177 --> 44:40.843
You know, I wish
you woulda lived long enough

44:40.845 --> 44:44.981
to see me win my first
primary for council seat.

44:44.983 --> 44:49.152
New on the job, everybody
wanted to be my friend.

44:57.696 --> 44:59.662
It won't be like this
forever, though, right?

45:03.668 --> 45:04.784
I'll see you.

45:04.786 --> 45:06.202
Okay.

45:06.204 --> 45:07.954
Ahem.

45:13.428 --> 45:15.962
That's the son of a bitch
working for Judge Sand.

45:15.964 --> 45:18.214
<i>The guy with the beard.</i>

45:21.886 --> 45:23.219
Oh.

45:24.689 --> 45:26.723
You piece of shit. That's
right, you're a piece of shit.

45:26.725 --> 45:27.807
<i>Hiding behind the cops.</i>

45:27.809 --> 45:30.059
He's a Jew, Newman.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.362
<i>They all are. That's
why this is happening.</i>

45:32.364 --> 45:34.731
- They're not all Jewish.
- Well, Sussman,

45:34.733 --> 45:36.866
the lawyer that brought
the suit, he's Jewish.

45:36.868 --> 45:38.735
And Newman and Sand.

45:38.737 --> 45:43.072
Last weekend, when we went up to
Pound Ridge where he has a house--

45:43.074 --> 45:44.907
Wait a minute.
You went-- you--

45:44.909 --> 45:47.794
I'm sorry, but you
went to Pound Ridge

45:47.796 --> 45:50.663
where Judge Sand lives
to protest?

45:50.665 --> 45:53.750
Judge wasn't home, but I'm
sure he got the message.

45:53.752 --> 45:56.919
You know, I don't think it's right
to make this about religion.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.337
That's not the point.

45:58.339 --> 46:02.675
All I'm saying is look who's
behind all this mess.

46:16.441 --> 46:18.491
Good to see you.

46:19.527 --> 46:22.161
Well, it's gonna
be a wild one.

46:22.163 --> 46:26.282
- Don't you feel threatened?
- Nah. Goes with the job.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.618
Maybe with yours.

46:29.954 --> 46:32.255
<i>All right, Hank!
Go get 'em!</i>

46:32.257 --> 46:37.043
Hey, Hank! You tell 'em!

46:39.097 --> 46:42.348
<i>Show us the pictures!
Let us see what's on them.</i>

46:56.781 --> 46:59.148
Will council members
please take their seats?

47:02.454 --> 47:04.454
Council members,
take your seats, please.

47:05.824 --> 47:08.458
Mr. Spallone, would you
please take your seat?

47:11.045 --> 47:13.996
All right, as a first
order of business,

47:13.998 --> 47:17.800
the, uh--
the council members

47:17.802 --> 47:20.386
<i>would like to</i>
<i>just take a few moments</i>

47:20.388 --> 47:22.421
<i>to honor the firefighters</i>

47:22.423 --> 47:25.174
<i>and the police officers</i>
<i>of this city</i>

47:25.176 --> 47:29.729
who have shown extraordinary
bravery this past year.

47:31.850 --> 47:34.317
These men risk
their lives.

47:36.905 --> 47:39.689
You go home to your
mother, Wasicsko!

47:39.691 --> 47:42.492
Go home to your mother!

47:42.494 --> 47:44.944
Your father
would be ashamed of you.

47:44.946 --> 47:47.363
Officers,
please eject this woman.

47:47.365 --> 47:50.116
You hear me?
You're a sleaze!

47:50.118 --> 47:53.002
You're a sleaze,
Wasicsko!

47:53.004 --> 47:56.756
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

47:56.758 --> 47:59.425
- Here we go.
- Shame on you, Mr. Mayor.

48:00.962 --> 48:04.046
I invite everyone to come with
me to the housing projects.

48:04.048 --> 48:05.214
<i>Yeah.</i>

48:05.216 --> 48:09.268
You can see here what public
housing always leads to.

48:09.270 --> 48:12.555
Not just here in Yonkers,
but everywhere else.

48:12.557 --> 48:15.975
<i>Now, these are places that
have become crack jungles</i>

48:15.977 --> 48:20.363
which have trapped innocent people
in the name of helping minorities.

48:20.365 --> 48:22.949
As many of you know, I have
been opposed to this plan...

48:22.951 --> 48:24.283
<i>Cola, you sellout!</i>

48:24.285 --> 48:26.035
...but I am voting
for it because...

48:29.908 --> 48:33.543
I am voting for it because maintaining
our bond rating is too important.

48:33.545 --> 48:36.295
This is a direct attack
by the judge

48:36.297 --> 48:38.581
on the quality of life
here in Yonkers.

48:38.583 --> 48:40.666
This is--

48:40.668 --> 48:44.503
it's a typical case of the
hypocrisy of the rich

48:44.505 --> 48:46.505
and the elitists
looking down on those

48:46.507 --> 48:48.758
who have to work
for everything they have.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.977
It is not up
to this council

48:50.979 --> 48:54.013
to judge on the constitutionality
of a court order.

48:55.433 --> 48:59.602
We've all sworn an obligation
to uphold and obey the law.

48:59.604 --> 49:01.103
This is not about race.

49:01.105 --> 49:04.657
This is not solely a black
and white question.

49:04.659 --> 49:07.276
This is a green issue.

49:07.278 --> 49:11.197
This is a question
of economics.

49:11.199 --> 49:13.282
Roll call vote,
Mr. Clerk,

49:13.284 --> 49:17.336
on the intent to adopt the
housing plan as proposed.

49:17.338 --> 49:20.873
<i>I got your
intent right here!</i>

49:20.875 --> 49:23.125
- Mayor Wasicsko.
- Aye.

49:23.127 --> 49:25.544
Vice Mayor Spallone?

49:25.546 --> 49:28.047
No.

49:28.049 --> 49:30.766
- <i> Majority Leader Cola?</i>
- Yes.

49:32.553 --> 49:35.471
- Minority Leader Longo?
- No.

49:36.858 --> 49:40.943
- <i> Council Member Fagan?</i>
- No.

49:40.945 --> 49:44.563
- <i> Mr. Chema?</i>
- No.

49:44.565 --> 49:48.234
- <i> Mr. Oxman?</i>
- Yes.

49:48.236 --> 49:50.786
<i>I have three
ayes, four nays.</i>

49:50.788 --> 49:52.321
<i>The measure fails.</i>

49:52.323 --> 49:53.489
Meeting adjourned.

49:57.996 --> 49:59.795
There does have to come
a moment of truth,

49:59.797 --> 50:02.715
a moment of reckoning, a moment
when the City of Yonkers

50:02.717 --> 50:06.335
seeks not to become a national
symbol of defiance of civil rights

50:06.337 --> 50:09.972
<i>and not to heap shame</i>
<i>upon shame upon itself.</i>

50:09.974 --> 50:13.009
No court has strained harder,
with greater patience,

50:13.011 --> 50:16.012
<i>to defer to the state</i>
<i>and local government.</i>

50:17.515 --> 50:20.399
<i>But it would be difficult</i>
<i>to imagine a clearer challenge</i>

50:20.401 --> 50:23.903
<i>to the Constitution</i>
<i>or to a government of law</i>

50:23.905 --> 50:27.106
<i>than that presented</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

50:27.108 --> 50:28.824
<i>I therefore have</i>
<i>no alternative</i>

50:28.826 --> 50:33.663
other than to find the City of
Yonkers in contempt of this court

50:33.665 --> 50:37.867
and impose a penalty of $100
a day, beginning today.

50:37.869 --> 50:40.670
<i>A fine that will double</i>
<i>every day hereafter.</i>

50:40.672 --> 50:42.455
<i>As for you, councilmen,</i>

50:42.457 --> 50:45.875
<i>I find your rationale to be</i>
<i>a frivolous pretext.</i>

50:45.877 --> 50:49.462
How much hypocrisy must
accompany this litigation?

50:49.464 --> 50:53.432
I find Councilmen Longo,
Fagan, Chema, and Spallone

50:53.434 --> 50:57.553
<i>to be personally and individually
in contempt of this court</i>

50:57.555 --> 50:59.555
and impose upon each
of you a penalty

50:59.557 --> 51:03.192
of $500 a day,
beginning today.

51:04.729 --> 51:08.564
<i>In addition, if the necessary
legislation is not enacted</i>

51:08.566 --> 51:11.617
<i>on or before</i>
<i>next Wednesday, August 10th,</i>

51:11.619 --> 51:14.320
<i>you will report to the federal
marshal for imprisonment</i>

51:14.322 --> 51:17.073
<i>until such time</i>
<i>as you have purged yourself</i>

51:17.075 --> 51:20.743
<i>of contempt by approving</i>
<i>the housing plan.</i>

51:20.745 --> 51:23.462
This court
stands adjourned.

51:23.464 --> 51:25.798
All rise.

51:35.843 --> 51:38.594
_

51:44.268 --> 51:47.520
Is anybody
gonna get that?

51:47.522 --> 51:49.655
Lisa?

51:51.325 --> 51:53.242
Nay?

51:53.244 --> 51:55.745
Is anybody out here?

52:10.962 --> 52:12.261
Mayor's office.

52:12.263 --> 52:13.846
<i>Yes, my name</i>
<i>is Mary Dorman.</i>

52:13.848 --> 52:15.631
<i>I would like to talk</i>
<i>to the mayor, please.</i>

52:15.633 --> 52:16.932
This is the mayor.

52:19.971 --> 52:21.387
<i>Hello?</i>

52:23.057 --> 52:25.441
This is Mayor Wasicsko.

52:26.394 --> 52:29.895
This is--
I didn't, uh--

52:29.897 --> 52:33.816
I didn't expect
for you to answer.

52:35.570 --> 52:38.037
I called-- I wanted
to tell you that I, um--

52:38.039 --> 52:41.373
I think it's wrong of you
to support the housing.

52:43.294 --> 52:47.079
Yeah, well,
the law is the law,

52:47.081 --> 52:51.167
and the judge ordered it
and the court upheld it

52:51.169 --> 52:54.003
and the law's the law.

52:54.005 --> 52:56.472
Well, why can't you say
that you think it's wrong?

52:56.474 --> 52:57.923
At least let
the people know that.

52:57.925 --> 53:02.478
Because that's not what
a leader is supposed to do.

53:02.480 --> 53:05.431
A leader is supposed to lead, and
that's what I'm trying to do.

53:10.154 --> 53:13.689
You threw me out
of the last council meeting.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.194
Which one were you?

53:18.196 --> 53:21.614
I have gray
salt-and-pepper hair.

53:21.616 --> 53:23.332
I have--
wear glasses.

53:23.334 --> 53:26.919
I was standing
right at the railing.

53:28.289 --> 53:30.089
Yeah, I remember you.

53:36.214 --> 53:38.547
I promise I'll never
have you thrown out again.

53:41.769 --> 53:43.435
Okay?

53:45.389 --> 53:46.889
Okay.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.479
All right,
good-bye now.

54:03.157 --> 54:05.324
Who was that?

54:05.326 --> 54:07.409
No one, really.
