02:50.857 --> 02:54.054
So, Jamal...

02:54.127 --> 02:55.617
<i>tell me something about yourself.</i>

02:59.933 --> 03:03.061
I work in a call center.
In Juhu.

Good.

03:05.204 --> 03:07.502
<i>A phone basher.</i>

03:07.574 --> 03:09.474
And what type of call center
would that be?

03:09.542 --> 03:12.272
XL 5 mobile phones.

03:12.345 --> 03:17.305
Oh. So you're the one who calls
me up every single day of my
life with special offers, huh?

03:17.383 --> 03:20.944
No. Actually, I'm an assistant.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.988
An assistant phone basher?

03:25.124 --> 03:29.151
And what does a assistant
phone basher do exactly?

03:29.228 --> 03:32.322
I get tea for people and-

03:32.398 --> 03:35.162
Chai wallah.
A chai wallah!

03:37.937 --> 03:40.337
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

03:40.406 --> 03:42.966
Jamal Malik-

03:43.042 --> 03:47.672
...from Mumbai, let's play
<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

03:57.390 --> 03:59.790
So, has he confessed yet?

03:59.859 --> 04:02.885
Except his name, I could not get
anything out of the runt.

04:02.962 --> 04:06.796
You have been here a whole bloody night,
Srinivas. What have you been doing?

04:06.866 --> 04:08.857
He's a tough guy.

04:08.935 --> 04:11.631
A little electricity will loosen his tongue.
Give him.

04:11.704 --> 04:13.695
Yes, sir.

04:22.281 --> 04:26.377
<i>Okay. So, were you wired up?</i>
<i>Mobile or a pager?</i>

04:27.453 --> 04:30.718
A coughing accomplice
in the audience...

04:30.790 --> 04:34.021
<i>or a microchip under the skin?</i>

04:34.093 --> 04:36.755
Huh?

04:40.433 --> 04:42.367
- The chip is not here.
- <i>Not here?</i>

04:42.435 --> 04:45.427
- No.
- Okay. Leave the chip.
Leave the chip. Leave the chip.

04:46.439 --> 04:48.805
It's hot...

04:48.875 --> 04:51.844
and my wife is giving me hell...

04:51.911 --> 04:55.438
and I've got a desk full <i>of</i>
murderers, rapists...

04:55.515 --> 04:59.383
extortionists, bum bandits and you.

05:01.821 --> 05:04.722
So why don't you save us
both a lot of time...

05:06.492 --> 05:09.120
and tell me how you cheated.

05:11.130 --> 05:13.121
Hmm.

05:25.244 --> 05:27.235
I'm done, sir.

05:31.684 --> 05:33.675
Now, listen.

05:36.189 --> 05:38.180
Hello.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.655
He's unconscious, Juti.
What good is that?

05:42.729 --> 05:44.959
How many times
have I told you, Srinivas?

05:45.031 --> 05:46.931
I'm sorry, sir.

05:46.999 --> 05:50.264
<i>Srinivas. Now we'll have...</i>

05:50.336 --> 05:53.100
Amnesty International here next,
peeing in their pants about human rights.

05:53.172 --> 05:55.470
Sir, I was thinking, um-

05:55.541 --> 05:58.908
- Get him down, tidy him up,
please, for God's sake!
- <i>Sir...</i>

05:58.978 --> 06:01.674
what if he did know the answers?

06:04.417 --> 06:08.114
Professors, doctors, lawyers,
general knowledge wallahs...

06:08.187 --> 06:10.246
never get beyond 16,000 rupees.

06:10.323 --> 06:13.622
He's on 10 million.
What the hell can a...

06:13.693 --> 06:15.684
slumdog possibly know?

06:17.930 --> 06:19.921
The answers.

06:25.338 --> 06:28.739
I knew the answers.

08:18.551 --> 08:22.419
<i># They can't touch me</i>

<i># One day I wanna be a star</i>

08:39.105 --> 08:42.597
<i># I'll go to Vegas if they pay us</i>
<i>just to forget my scars #</i>

08:45.511 --> 08:48.412
Sorry.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.081
Sorry. Sorry.

08:53.152 --> 08:54.585
Sorry!

08:54.654 --> 08:56.315
<i># They can't touch me</i>

08:56.389 --> 08:58.823

<i>"You have sent for me, sir,"said Athos.</i>

09:29.855 --> 09:31.789
- "You have sent for me, sir."
- <i>Ah.</i>

09:47.206 --> 09:49.071
Huh?

10:09.095 --> 10:11.325
So...

10:11.397 --> 10:13.331
Mr. Malik...

10:13.399 --> 10:15.959
the man who knows all the answers.

10:17.403 --> 10:19.394
Talk.

10:20.406 --> 10:22.397
Talk.

10:26.112 --> 10:28.046
So, Jamal...

10:28.114 --> 10:31.606
are you ready for the first question
for 1,000 rupees?

10:31.684 --> 10:33.675
Yes.

10:33.753 --> 10:36.881
Not bad money to sit on a chair
and answer a question.

10:36.956 --> 10:39.584
Better than making tea, no?

10:39.658 --> 10:42.183
No. Yes. No.

10:42.261 --> 10:44.126
No? Yes? No?

10:44.196 --> 10:47.256
Is that your final answer?

10:47.333 --> 10:51.099
<i>So, remember, you have</i>
<i>three lifelines.</i>

10:51.170 --> 10:54.105
Ask the audience, fifty-fifty...

10:54.173 --> 10:55.731
<i>phone a friend.</i>

10:55.808 --> 10:59.369
So the first question for 1,000 rupees.
Here we go.

11:00.579 --> 11:05.539
Who was the star in
the 1973 hit film <i>Zanjeer?</i>

12:05.111 --> 12:07.011
Amitabh?

12:28.067 --> 12:30.126
Amitabh Bachchan!

12:36.275 --> 12:38.004
Salim!

13:09.108 --> 13:12.168
Amitabh Bachchan!

13:14.346 --> 13:17.008
<i>Amitabh!</i>

13:47.046 --> 13:50.209
Yea!

13:50.282 --> 13:53.740
<i>Amitabh-</i>

14:57.716 --> 14:59.616
<i>"A."Amitabh Bachchan.</i>

15:00.886 --> 15:03.047
Guess what. You're right.
You just won 1,000 rupees.

15:07.092 --> 15:09.060
You don't have to be a genius.

15:09.128 --> 15:11.494
I knew it was Amitabh Bachchan.

15:11.563 --> 15:13.554
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

15:13.632 --> 15:16.726
Like I said, don't have to be
a genius.

15:19.104 --> 15:21.698
He's the most famous man in India.

15:22.975 --> 15:25.569
<i>A picture of three lions...</i>

15:25.644 --> 15:28.477
<i>is seen in the national</i>
<i>emblem of India.</i>

15:28.547 --> 15:31.414
What is written underneath?

15:31.483 --> 15:35.044
"A," the truth alone triumphs...

15:35.120 --> 15:37.588
"B," lies alone triumph...

15:37.656 --> 15:41.490
<i>"C,"fashion alone triumphs...</i>

15:41.560 --> 15:45.394
"D," money alone triumphs?

15:49.802 --> 15:51.770
What do you think, Jamal?

15:53.105 --> 15:56.233
<i>The most famous phrase</i>
<i>of our country.</i>

15:56.308 --> 15:58.037
Would you like to phone a friend?

15:58.110 --> 16:00.544
Ask the audience.

16:00.612 --> 16:04.514
Put the poor man out of his misery,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:04.583 --> 16:09.350
My five-year-old daughter can answer
that question, but you couldn't.

16:09.421 --> 16:12.288
That's strange for
a millionaire genius.

16:12.358 --> 16:14.292
What happened?

16:14.360 --> 16:17.454
Your accomplice nip out for a piss?

16:17.529 --> 16:20.293
The inspector is asking something.

16:20.366 --> 16:24.132
How much is pani puri
at Harish's stall on Chowpatty?

16:24.203 --> 16:25.761
What?

16:25.838 --> 16:28.534
<i>Pani puri. One plate, how much?</i>

16:28.607 --> 16:31.474
- Ten rupees.
- Wrong.

16:31.543 --> 16:33.534
Fifteen since Divali.

16:34.947 --> 16:37.973
Who stole
Constable Vermaas's bicycle...

16:38.050 --> 16:40.041
outside Santa Cruz
station last Thursday?

16:41.120 --> 16:43.111
You know who that was?

16:43.188 --> 16:45.884
Everyone in Juhu knows that.

16:45.958 --> 16:49.894
Even five-year-olds.

16:52.598 --> 16:55.260
<i> Congratulations, Jamal.</i>
<i>You just won 4,000 rupees.</i>

17:00.606 --> 17:03.473
For 16,000 rupees.

17:05.277 --> 17:07.438
Religion.

17:07.512 --> 17:09.571
Interesting.

17:09.647 --> 17:12.242
<i>In depictions of God Rama...</i>

17:12.317 --> 17:16.685
<i>he is famously holding what</i>
<i>in his right hand?</i>

17:26.231 --> 17:28.222
Hey, Jamal.

18:26.758 --> 18:28.692
Jamal-

19:49.942 --> 19:53.673
I wake up every morning wishing I didn't
know the answer to that question.

19:57.649 --> 20:00.379
If it wasn't for Rama and Allah...

20:01.954 --> 20:03.922
I would still have a mother.

20:13.765 --> 20:15.756
A bow and arrow.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.029
Final answer?

20:20.572 --> 20:22.563
Final answer.

20:22.641 --> 20:26.975
Hmm. Ah. <i>Computer-ji,</i>
<i>"D"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

20:32.050 --> 20:34.018
You've just won 16,000 rupees.

Well done, my friend.

20:41.126 --> 20:44.357
<i>Time for a commercial break.</i>
<i>Don't go away now.</i>

20:44.429 --> 20:47.830
<i> You got lucky, huh?</i>

20:47.899 --> 20:50.732
If I were you,
I would take the money and run.

20:50.802 --> 20:52.793
You're not gonna get the next one.

20:52.871 --> 20:54.862
<i>Everybody back in 90, please. Okay?</i>

20:54.940 --> 20:57.602
<i>Can you come and do</i>
<i>the controls, please?</i>

22:07.913 --> 22:09.904
Salim.

23:24.523 --> 23:27.686
Welcome back to <i>Who Wants</i>
<i>to Be a Millionaire?</i>

23:27.759 --> 23:30.785

23:35.133 --> 23:37.124

23:38.570 --> 23:42.563
So, my friend,
you're into serious money.

23:45.644 --> 23:47.635
Yes.

23:53.018 --> 23:57.250
The song "Darshan do Ghanshyam" was
written by which famous Indian poet?

23:57.322 --> 24:02.316
<i>"A,"Surdas, "B," Tulsidas...</i>

They blinded her too?

38:18.549 --> 38:20.540
They had other plans.

38:21.852 --> 38:24.446
It took me a long time to find out.

Hey.

41:05.916 --> 41:07.213
Salim! Salim!

41:38.949 --> 41:40.940
Is this heaven?

41:46.657 --> 41:49.057
You're not dead, Jamal.

41:49.126 --> 41:51.788
What is it?

41:51.862 --> 41:54.422
Some hotel, huh?

41:54.498 --> 41:58.264
The Taj Mahal is considered the finest
example of Mogul architecture.

41:58.335 --> 42:02.169
<i>... who died on June 17, 1631-</i>

42:02.239 --> 42:04.639
<i>during the birth</i>
<i>of their 14th child.</i>

42:04.708 --> 42:09.338
The Taj Mahal was completed around, uh,
1648, using a labor force of 20,000 workers-

42:09.413 --> 42:14.407
In 1980 it became a UNESCO
World Heritage Site and was cited as the-

42:24.261 --> 42:25.922
If you would like to follow me...

42:25.996 --> 42:28.487
I will show you 99 names of Allah
on Mumtaz's tomb.

42:28.565 --> 42:30.965
<i>Please take off your shoes.</i>

42:50.187 --> 42:54.180
Please. Please.
What time is the next tour?

42:54.258 --> 42:56.192
We are on a very tight
schedule, you see.

42:56.260 --> 42:58.888
Have to see the Red Fort
this afternoon.

42:58.963 --> 43:01.488
- No, I-
- Please, would it be possible...

43:01.565 --> 43:03.556
to show us around now?

43:03.634 --> 43:07.229
Obviously we understand
that it costs more for just the two of us.

43:09.273 --> 43:11.673
But of course, madam.

43:11.742 --> 43:14.210
Please follow me.

43:14.278 --> 43:18.374
The Taj Mahal was built
by Emperor Khurram...

43:18.449 --> 43:20.576
for his wife Mumtaz.

43:20.651 --> 43:23.586
Was the maximum beautiful
woman in the world.

43:23.654 --> 43:27.681
So, when she died, the emperor decided
to build this...

43:27.758 --> 43:29.885
five-star hotel...

43:29.960 --> 43:32.190
for everyone
who'd like to visit her too.

43:32.262 --> 43:36.164
But he died in 1587...

43:36.233 --> 43:39.862
before any of the rooms
were built or any of the lifts.

43:39.937 --> 43:42.269
But the swimming pool,
as you can see...

43:42.339 --> 43:46.605
<i>was completed on schedule,</i>
<i>in top-class fashion.</i>

43:46.677 --> 43:49.373
There's nothing of this
in the guidebook.

43:49.446 --> 43:54.110
The guidebook was written by a bunch <i>of</i>
lazy, good-for-nothing Indian beggars.

43:54.184 --> 43:56.516
Oh.

43:56.587 --> 44:02.423
And this, lady and gentleman,
is the burial place of Mumtaz.

44:02.493 --> 44:05.326
How did she die?

44:05.396 --> 44:08.593
- A road traffic accident.
- Really?

44:08.665 --> 44:11.327
Maximum pileup.

44:11.402 --> 44:15.031
I thought she died in childbirth.

44:15.105 --> 44:19.701
Exactly, sir. She was on the way
to hospital when it happened.

44:26.216 --> 44:28.480
Ready?
Don't move an inch.

44:28.552 --> 44:30.417
<i>Smile.</i>

44:34.324 --> 44:36.451
Unbreakable Thailand wood.

44:36.527 --> 44:39.496

44:39.563 --> 44:41.793

45:18.869 --> 45:22.828
This, Mr. David, is the biggest dhobi ghat
in the whole of India.

45:22.906 --> 45:24.771
That's amazing.

45:24.842 --> 45:29.040
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Take a real good look at this.</i>

45:29.113 --> 45:32.844
They say that every man
in Uttar Pradesh...

45:32.916 --> 45:37.853
is wearing a kurta that has been
at least washed once out here.

45:43.961 --> 45:45.485
<i>Formula One! Formula One!</i>

45:45.562 --> 45:48.554
Pit stop <i>ka</i> speed!

45:49.633 --> 45:51.794
<i>The-The cows, the-the buffaloes.</i>

45:51.869 --> 45:53.837
What are those over there?

46:02.913 --> 46:04.847
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

46:04.915 --> 46:07.213
What the hell happened here?

46:09.286 --> 46:11.846
Okay-

46:11.922 --> 46:13.822
<i> Okay! Okay!</i>

46:13.891 --> 46:17.054
Cool it! Cool it, will ya? Jesus.

46:17.127 --> 46:20.426
- You got insurance, don't ya?
Are you okay?

46:20.497 --> 46:23.694
- You wanted to see a bit
of real India, here it is.

46:23.767 --> 46:27.999
- All right!
- Well, here is a bit of
the real America, son.

46:29.773 --> 46:32.105
Oh. Yes, yes. Jesus.

46:34.478 --> 46:36.469
Here.

48:23.053 --> 48:27.820
<i>there is a portrait</i>

48:34.598 --> 48:37.499
"C," Benjamin Franklin...

48:37.567 --> 48:40.798
"D," Abraham Lincoln?

48:44.574 --> 48:48.635
Pay or play, Jamal?

48:50.147 --> 48:52.707
You decide.

48:52.783 --> 48:55.911
Oh, God. He's looking at the camera.
He hasn't got a clue.

48:55.986 --> 48:58.887
This is gonna be a walk-away.
Stand by.

48:58.955 --> 49:02.049
No. He's gonna play with him first.

49:02.125 --> 49:04.059
<i>Jamal.</i>

49:04.127 --> 49:07.995
Get a lot of $100 bills
in your line of work?

49:09.766 --> 49:11.757
The minimum tip for my services.

49:11.835 --> 49:13.496
Oh.

49:13.570 --> 49:17.028
Now I know why my cell phone
bills are so high.

49:17.107 --> 49:19.769
They tip the chai wallah
with $100 bills.

49:19.843 --> 49:23.574
It's "C."
Benjamin Franklin.

49:23.647 --> 49:27.014
- You're gonna play, huh?
- I think I just have, haven't I?

49:27.084 --> 49:29.644
<i> You certainly have.</i>
<i>"C,"right? Right?</i>

49:29.720 --> 49:31.688
Who's on the thousand-rupee note?

49:31.755 --> 49:34.952
I don't know.

49:35.025 --> 49:36.788
You don't know?

49:36.860 --> 49:39.294
Gandhi-ji.

49:39.363 --> 49:42.423
Oh. I've heard of him.

49:44.601 --> 49:46.933
Don't get clever...

49:47.003 --> 49:49.062
or I'll get the electricity
out again.

49:49.139 --> 49:51.767
Look.

49:51.842 --> 49:54.140
They didn't ask me that question.

49:54.211 --> 49:57.374
I don't know why.
Ask them.

49:57.447 --> 50:01.383
It's funny. You don't seem
that interested in money.

50:04.321 --> 50:06.551
As a matter of fact, you have...

50:06.623 --> 50:09.456
one million rupees!

50:14.431 --> 50:16.592
Explain the $100 bill.

50:19.169 --> 50:22.366
Bombay had turned into Mumbai.

50:25.242 --> 50:27.608
Why can't you understand?

50:27.677 --> 50:29.702
I'm sick of this now.

51:35.212 --> 51:39.080
<i>Two chicken burgers, two fries,</i>
<i>one mango lassi, one Coke.</i>

51:39.149 --> 51:41.083
One mineral water.

51:43.620 --> 51:46.145
Shimla.

51:47.390 --> 51:49.324
I'm going to Chowpatty, okay?

51:49.392 --> 51:52.054
Wanna come?

51:52.128 --> 51:55.825
For God's sake.
You've got some disease.

51:55.899 --> 51:58.390
You forced me back
to this shithole...

51:58.468 --> 52:03.496
we leave our friends, a good life,
loads of money... for this?

52:03.573 --> 52:06.701
- We came back to find her.
- You <i>did.</i>

52:06.776 --> 52:08.710
I don't give a shit about her.

52:08.778 --> 52:10.712
Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim.

52:10.780 --> 52:12.714
Oh, yes, sir.

52:12.782 --> 52:16.047
You should come back to the cages
on Saturday night...

52:16.119 --> 52:19.145
instead of go searching
for your lost love.

52:19.222 --> 52:21.213
I'm going to Chowpatty.

52:21.291 --> 52:23.816
"I'm going to Chowpatty."

52:24.995 --> 52:28.055
There are 19 million people
in this city, Jamal.

52:29.132 --> 52:32.568
Forget about her.
She's history.

53:07.938 --> 53:09.929
Dollars?

53:11.775 --> 53:14.710
100.

53:45.108 --> 53:48.043
I'm sorry, Arvind.

54:13.570 --> 54:15.504
Thanks.

55:30.980 --> 55:33.574
Oh. Sorry.

55:35.018 --> 55:37.714
Cherry?

55:45.462 --> 55:47.987
So, is it her or not?

55:53.503 --> 55:56.404
<i>She's sexy, man.</i>

55:56.473 --> 55:58.464
Latika!

56:02.746 --> 56:04.577
- Who is this?
- Jamal?

56:04.647 --> 56:07.241
- I'll get the bag.
- Who are you? What do you want?

56:07.317 --> 56:08.841
- Quick!
- <i>You stupid boys.</i>

56:08.918 --> 56:10.852
- Come on. Pack it in.
- What are you doing?

56:10.920 --> 56:13.616
- How did you find me?
- Later. Later.

56:13.690 --> 56:15.988
<i> No, not everything.</i>

56:16.059 --> 56:17.993
<i>Get out, if you can.</i>

56:18.061 --> 56:20.791
- <i> Take the cash. Take the cash.</i>
- <i> Come on. We gotta go.</i>

56:20.864 --> 56:23.492
Let's go. Let's go. Shit.

56:24.934 --> 56:27.266
Look who we have here.

56:28.972 --> 56:30.997
Hello again...

56:31.074 --> 56:33.770
Jamal...

56:33.843 --> 56:35.834
Salim.

56:35.912 --> 56:38.881
<i>Never forget a face.</i>

56:38.948 --> 56:41.508
Hey, Punnoose?

56:41.584 --> 56:43.779
<i>Especially one that I own.</i>

56:46.356 --> 56:52.056
You really thought you could just walk in
and take my prize away?

56:52.128 --> 56:54.995
<i>Latika, come.</i>

57:00.270 --> 57:03.501
Have you any idea
how much this little virgin is worth?

57:05.875 --> 57:08.400
- <i>Please continue, Master-ji.</i>
- Okay, sir.

57:08.478 --> 57:10.639
- Get them out of here.
- No!

57:17.220 --> 57:18.710
Move!

57:18.788 --> 57:20.517
Get over there.

57:21.658 --> 57:23.819
Let's not be foolish, Salim.

57:26.930 --> 57:29.057
<i>Heavy, isn't it?</i>
<i>Give it to me.</i>

57:29.132 --> 57:30.827
Huh?

57:30.900 --> 57:33.368
On your knees. Down!

57:35.238 --> 57:37.206
Both of you, down!

57:41.344 --> 57:43.505
Money!

57:44.581 --> 57:47.015
You can have money.

57:47.083 --> 57:48.880
<i>Here.</i>

57:51.154 --> 57:53.884
Look.

57:56.125 --> 57:58.389
<i>Take it. Go.</i>

57:58.461 --> 58:02.397
Disappear with your... friend,
and we'll forget all about this. Okay?

58:02.465 --> 58:04.956
Maman never forgets.

58:05.034 --> 58:07.559
Isn't that right?

58:07.637 --> 58:10.902
Oh, Maman can
make an exception, huh?

58:12.675 --> 58:15.974
I can't take that risk,
Maman. Sorry.

58:27.123 --> 58:29.250
<i>Let's go!</i>

58:29.325 --> 58:31.486
Stay!

58:31.561 --> 58:33.222
<i>Jamal!</i>

58:33.296 --> 58:34.490
Jamal.

58:38.501 --> 58:40.594
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

58:49.045 --> 58:53.004
<i>Who invented the revolver?</i>

58:58.221 --> 59:00.917
Samuel Colt.

59:00.990 --> 59:03.618
Final answer?

59:04.761 --> 59:06.695
Final answer.

59:06.763 --> 59:09.527
Jamal Malik...

59:09.599 --> 59:11.533
you're on a dream run.

59:13.303 --> 59:15.703
My heart says you're gonna win more.

59:15.772 --> 59:18.002
<i>Computer-ji...</i>

59:18.074 --> 59:20.008
<i>"A"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

59:26.683 --> 59:28.651
I was right.

59:28.718 --> 59:32.154
The chai wallah has done it again.

59:34.924 --> 59:36.915
Incredible!

59:53.042 --> 59:55.408
- Service!
- Reception!

01:00:03.786 --> 01:00:06.482
Oh!

01:00:17.934 --> 01:00:20.664
- Found something.
- <i> Stay there. Look away.</i>

01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:26.402
<i>I know if you're looking.</i>

01:00:26.476 --> 01:00:28.706
No, I'm not.

01:00:28.778 --> 01:00:30.769
<i>Is Salim still there?</i>

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.611
Where's Salim?

01:00:43.326 --> 01:00:45.317
Don't know.

01:00:48.031 --> 01:00:50.022
You're a sweet boy, Jamal.

01:01:41.717 --> 01:01:44.811
I'm looking for Javed.

01:01:44.887 --> 01:01:47.355
He's not looking for you.

01:01:51.694 --> 01:01:54.128
I killed Maman.

01:01:54.197 --> 01:01:56.131
And I'll kill you too.

01:02:00.236 --> 01:02:02.136
Easy.

01:02:02.205 --> 01:02:05.038
<i>Did you really kill him?</i>

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.774
Good.

01:02:11.848 --> 01:02:14.908
<i>My enemy's enemy is a friend.</i>

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.745
<i>Come here, my friend.</i>

01:02:24.093 --> 01:02:28.086
Mm. I've been looking
for someone like you.

01:02:35.204 --> 01:02:37.672
You came back for me.

01:02:39.408 --> 01:02:41.433
Of course.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.078
I thought you'd forgotten.

01:02:48.518 --> 01:02:52.477
I never forgot.
Not for one moment.

01:02:52.555 --> 01:02:55.251
<i>I knew I'd find you in the end.</i>

01:02:55.324 --> 01:02:58.350
It's our destiny.

01:02:59.662 --> 01:03:01.653
Destiny.

01:03:21.083 --> 01:03:23.745
Hey.

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:30.851
Come.

01:03:30.927 --> 01:03:33.452
No, Brother.
You've had a lot to drink.

01:03:33.529 --> 01:03:36.464
I am the elder. I am the boss.

01:03:36.532 --> 01:03:39.365
For once you do as I say.

01:03:39.435 --> 01:03:41.369
Now get out.

01:03:41.437 --> 01:03:44.201
Come on.
I saved your life, didn't I?

01:03:44.273 --> 01:03:46.207
Salim, please-

01:03:46.275 --> 01:03:49.108
I'll kill you!

01:03:49.178 --> 01:03:50.873
Kill you!

01:03:56.619 --> 01:03:58.109
I'll kill you!

01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:05.253
I am number one now.

01:04:07.997 --> 01:04:11.296
Salim!

01:04:11.367 --> 01:04:14.393
Salim, open it!

01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:16.438
Shut up!

01:04:16.505 --> 01:04:18.496
The man with the Colt.45
says shut up!

01:04:18.574 --> 01:04:23.978
Go now, or Gunmaster G-9 will
shoot you right between the eyes.

01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:26.949
Don't think he won't.

01:04:27.016 --> 01:04:31.282
I'm giving you five seconds.
One...

01:04:33.089 --> 01:04:35.023
two-

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.020
Go, Jamal.

01:04:40.229 --> 01:04:42.163
Go.

01:05:06.956 --> 01:05:10.756
So, did you see them again?

01:05:10.826 --> 01:05:13.056
I wouldn't be here if I had.

01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:17.022
Was she pretty?

01:05:18.868 --> 01:05:21.701
I guess not.

01:05:23.606 --> 01:05:26.040
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

01:05:26.108 --> 01:05:28.338
He means "the bitch of the slums."

01:05:28.411 --> 01:05:31.073
Hey. Hey!

01:05:31.147 --> 01:05:35.982
<i>Hey, no-</i>

01:05:40.389 --> 01:05:42.653
<i>Well, well.</i>

01:05:42.725 --> 01:05:44.522
The slumdog barks.

01:05:44.593 --> 01:05:47.061
<i>Money and women-</i>

01:05:47.129 --> 01:05:49.324
<i>the reasons to make</i>
<i>most mistakes in life.</i>

01:05:49.398 --> 01:05:51.059
<i>Correct.</i>

01:05:51.133 --> 01:05:53.101
Looks like you're
mixed up with both.

01:05:55.971 --> 01:05:57.905
Srinivas.

01:05:57.973 --> 01:06:00.271
You need the exercise.

01:06:00.343 --> 01:06:03.312
<i>Go and get me something to eat.</i>

01:06:03.379 --> 01:06:05.313
Yes, sir.

01:06:05.381 --> 01:06:07.349
<i>And chai.</i>

01:06:09.485 --> 01:06:11.419
Phaode!

01:06:18.427 --> 01:06:20.588
Idiot, Srinivas.

01:06:26.836 --> 01:06:28.770
You puzzle me, slumdog-

01:06:28.838 --> 01:06:32.797
admitting murder to avoid
the charge of fraud...

01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:35.207
is not exactly clever thinking.

01:06:37.513 --> 01:06:40.243
Now, why would you do that?

01:06:40.316 --> 01:06:42.443
Hmm?

01:06:42.518 --> 01:06:45.612
When somebody asks me a question...

01:06:45.688 --> 01:06:47.815
I tell them the answer.

01:06:49.859 --> 01:06:51.850
Hmm.

01:06:54.096 --> 01:06:58.260
So, how did you manage
to get on the show?

01:07:00.636 --> 01:07:02.570
<i>Okay, everyone. Listen up.</i>

01:07:02.638 --> 01:07:05.937
It's been a big week for U.K.

01:07:06.008 --> 01:07:07.976
Kat is back.

01:07:08.043 --> 01:07:09.840
But she was already back.

01:07:09.912 --> 01:07:12.244
<i>Bardi. Jamal?</i>

01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:16.347
Oh, well, she did come back.
Then she went away...

01:07:16.419 --> 01:07:19.479
when Alfie split up with her,
and now she's back again.

01:07:19.555 --> 01:07:21.785
But it looks as if Alfie
still fancies Mo after all.

01:07:21.857 --> 01:07:24.325
Thank you, Jamal.
Bardi, keep up.

01:07:24.393 --> 01:07:27.453
<i>The chai wallah knows more than you.</i>

01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:31.261
<i>Anyway, there's also</i>
<i>the festival in Edinburgh.</i>

01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:34.029
<i>Anybody knows Edinburgh?</i>
<i>Edinburgh?</i>

01:07:34.103 --> 01:07:38.802
Ah, kilts, castles,
uh, haggis, uh, Ben Nevis.

01:07:38.874 --> 01:07:40.808
<i>Good. Yes?</i>

01:07:40.876 --> 01:07:44.403
<i>Inspector Taggart, whiskey, Sean Connery.</i>

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.847
<i> Good. And lochs-</i>
<i>their word for lakes.</i>

01:07:47.917 --> 01:07:49.851
No filming.

01:07:55.524 --> 01:07:58.516
Jamal, come here.

01:07:58.594 --> 01:08:00.824
<i>I'm on</i> Millionaire <i>duty today.</i>

01:08:00.896 --> 01:08:03.694
- Dave-
- Please. Just for five minutes.

01:08:03.766 --> 01:08:05.131
I can't.

01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:07.795
Sit here.
If the team leader comes...

01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:11.237
- just pretend you are on a call
doing an upgrade for-
- Friends and Family. I know.

01:08:11.307 --> 01:08:13.298
- Yah.
- Two minutes.

01:08:13.375 --> 01:08:14.865
Ah.

01:08:18.781 --> 01:08:21.078
<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:23.913
<i>Dial this number now.</i>

01:08:23.986 --> 01:08:27.979
<i>Answer this question.</i>
<i>What does "A.T.M."-</i>

01:08:28.057 --> 01:08:30.149
Hello? Hello? Hello?

01:08:30.225 --> 01:08:33.559
I would like to be a contestant
on <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

01:08:33.629 --> 01:08:35.926
- <i> Hello? I want to be on-</i>
- <i>Uh-</i>

01:08:35.997 --> 01:08:38.865
Bloody bastard.
I never get it!

01:08:38.934 --> 01:08:41.402
You have to dial
when Prem says "if."

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:44.564
- That's when they open the lines.
- How the hell do you know that?

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.871
That's what Anjum in technical says.
He put the system in.

01:08:47.943 --> 01:08:50.604
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:08:50.679 --> 01:08:53.705
<i>Have I been transferred again,</i>
<i>for God's sake?</i>

01:08:53.782 --> 01:08:58.048
Hello? Good God,
will somebody talk to me?

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.179
Uh, hello...

01:09:00.256 --> 01:09:04.693
Mrs. Mackintosh
from..."King-uss-ie."

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.924
<i>It's Kingussie, love.</i>
<i>Pronounced "Kingussie."</i>

01:09:08.997 --> 01:09:11.761
So where are you from?
Abroad, I bet.

01:09:11.834 --> 01:09:15.099
Uh, just down the road
from your house, Mrs. Mackintosh.

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:16.796
Uh, next to the loch.

01:09:16.872 --> 01:09:19.636
<i>Och aye?</i>
<i>Which loch?</i>

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:21.767
Loch-

01:09:21.844 --> 01:09:25.404
Loch- Big... Loch Ben.

01:09:25.481 --> 01:09:29.247
Loch Big Ben. Next door
to Sean Connery's flat.

01:09:29.318 --> 01:09:32.082
I'd like to speak to your supervisor, son.

01:10:19.435 --> 01:10:22.165
- <i> Yes?</i>
- Salim?

01:10:22.237 --> 01:10:25.434
Who is this?
Do you know what time is this?

01:10:30.713 --> 01:10:35.116
Hello?

01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:51.798
Hello? Hello?

01:10:51.867 --> 01:10:54.301
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:10:56.438 --> 01:10:59.202
I'm calling from
XL 5 Communications, sir.

01:10:59.274 --> 01:11:01.742
As a valued customer,
we are offering you a free upgrade...

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:03.675
with our Friends and-

01:11:05.848 --> 01:11:07.839
Family-

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:10.384
Jamal?

01:11:10.452 --> 01:11:13.182
I-Is that you, Brother?

01:11:13.255 --> 01:11:16.224
Where are you?
I thought you were dead or something.

01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:19.055
Listen. We had to go, Jamal.

01:11:19.128 --> 01:11:23.155
Maman's guys- they were
searching the hotel.

01:11:23.232 --> 01:11:26.827
Jamal? Say something, please!

01:11:28.137 --> 01:11:30.901
Hello, Salim.

01:11:30.973 --> 01:11:33.168
<i>Cambridge Circus is not in Cambridge.</i>

01:11:33.242 --> 01:11:35.267
<i>Dare I ask why?</i>

01:11:35.344 --> 01:11:37.107
Too obvious.

01:11:37.179 --> 01:11:39.272
<i>There's definitely</i>
<i>an Oxford Circus in London.</i>

01:11:39.348 --> 01:11:44.342
<i>And there's a rowing race between Oxford</i>
<i>and Cambridge, so there's probably...</i>

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.388
a Cambridge Circus too, no?

01:11:46.455 --> 01:11:48.616
I'll go for "D," London.

01:11:48.691 --> 01:11:54.152
<i>Computer-ji, "D"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

01:12:00.602 --> 01:12:03.264
<i>Jamal Malik...</i>

01:12:03.338 --> 01:12:05.568
you're absolutely right!

01:12:15.517 --> 01:12:17.951
<i> It's getting hot in here.</i>

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.113
- Are you nervous?
- What?

01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:22.953
Am <i>I nervous?</i>

01:12:23.025 --> 01:12:25.619
It's you who's in
the hot seat, my friend.

01:12:25.694 --> 01:12:27.628
Oh, yes.

01:12:27.696 --> 01:12:29.823
Sorry.

01:12:29.898 --> 01:12:32.264
Bloody hell, he's got Prem on the run.

01:12:32.334 --> 01:12:34.928
- Finally.
- A few hours ago...

01:12:35.003 --> 01:12:39.099
you were giving chai
for the phone wallahs.

01:12:39.174 --> 01:12:42.803
And now you're richer
than they will ever be.

01:12:42.878 --> 01:12:45.346
What a player.

01:12:45.414 --> 01:12:47.575
Ladies and gentlemen, what a player!

01:13:30.125 --> 01:13:32.184
Jamal?

01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:37.460
God is good, bhai.
God is good.

01:13:53.448 --> 01:13:56.542
Maman's guys were after us.
We just had to skip.

01:13:56.618 --> 01:13:58.950
- Liar.
- Left a message for you at work.

01:13:59.021 --> 01:14:01.819
- Waited weeks for you at Nagpur.
- There was no message.

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:03.915
Bhai, I definitely left a message.

01:14:03.992 --> 01:14:08.088
There was no message. There was
no message! There was no message!

01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:15.193
I will never forgive you.

01:14:20.142 --> 01:14:23.043
I know.

01:14:26.815 --> 01:14:29.750
<i>That used to be our slum.</i>

01:14:31.453 --> 01:14:33.421
Can you believe that, huh?

01:14:33.488 --> 01:14:36.423
We used to live right there, man.

01:14:38.594 --> 01:14:41.563
Now it's all business.

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:45.430
India is at the center
of the world hub, bhai.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.434
And I-

01:14:47.502 --> 01:14:49.470
I am at the center...

01:14:49.538 --> 01:14:51.802
of the center.

01:14:53.675 --> 01:14:56.269
This is all Javed-bhai's.

01:14:58.013 --> 01:15:01.312
- Javed Khan?
- Sorry.

01:15:01.383 --> 01:15:03.613
<i> The gangster from our slum?</i>
<i>You work for him?</i>

01:15:03.685 --> 01:15:07.451
Come on. Who else do you think would
save us from Maman's guys, huh?

01:15:07.522 --> 01:15:09.490
What do you do for him?

01:15:11.627 --> 01:15:13.561
Anything he asks.

01:15:21.336 --> 01:15:24.533
He's coming.
You need to go now.

01:15:24.606 --> 01:15:27.473
- Take my card.
- What for?

01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:30.670
You think I'm gonna let you
out of my sights again, huh?

01:15:30.746 --> 01:15:32.805
You stay with me now,
younger brother.

01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:35.315
Now go- my place.

01:15:35.384 --> 01:15:38.478
Salim, where is Latika?

01:15:38.553 --> 01:15:40.578
Still?

01:15:44.059 --> 01:15:48.792
She's gone, Brother.
Long gone. Now go.

01:15:48.864 --> 01:15:51.389
Go to my place.

01:16:13.422 --> 01:16:15.356
- <i># Hey #</i>
- Hello?

01:16:15.424 --> 01:16:17.221
Okay, I'll be right there.

01:17:03.138 --> 01:17:05.072
<i># Hey #</i>

01:17:06.174 --> 01:17:08.074
<i># Hey #</i>

01:17:08.143 --> 01:17:10.008
<i># Hey #</i>

01:17:11.079 --> 01:17:12.444
<i># Hey #</i>

01:17:33.135 --> 01:17:35.069
<i># Hey #</i>

01:17:36.138 --> 01:17:37.867
<i># Hey ##</i>

01:17:37.939 --> 01:17:40.737
I'm the new cook from the agency.
A thousand apologies.

01:17:40.809 --> 01:17:43.334
I am so late for the memsahib.

01:17:43.412 --> 01:17:45.346
Just a minute.

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.890
<i> Excuse me.</i>

01:18:00.962 --> 01:18:03.328
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:18:03.398 --> 01:18:05.958
<i>There's nothing about any cook.</i>

01:18:06.034 --> 01:18:08.229
There is a dishwasher being delivered.

01:18:08.303 --> 01:18:10.567
Do you know anything about that?

01:18:10.639 --> 01:18:14.166
I <i>am</i> your dishwasher.

01:19:15.437 --> 01:19:17.132
Jamal.

01:19:22.611 --> 01:19:24.772
Look at you.

01:19:31.153 --> 01:19:33.087
I found you.

01:19:35.657 --> 01:19:37.591
I found you.

01:19:45.267 --> 01:19:47.360
Your face.

01:19:47.435 --> 01:19:49.562
You've hurt your eye.

01:19:49.638 --> 01:19:51.902
Why are you here?

01:19:53.508 --> 01:19:55.442
To see you.

01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:59.139
Well, you see me.

01:19:59.214 --> 01:20:01.205
Now what?

01:20:01.283 --> 01:20:05.219
<i>"C,"Eden's Bridge...</i>

01:20:05.287 --> 01:20:07.687
<i>or "D,"Apple's Bridge.</i>

01:20:09.824 --> 01:20:13.260
Why does everyone love this program?

01:20:14.529 --> 01:20:19.228
It's a chance to escape, isn't it?

01:20:19.301 --> 01:20:21.667
Walk into another life.

01:20:21.736 --> 01:20:24.569
Oh, God.

01:20:28.276 --> 01:20:30.938
Javed will kill you.
Just- Here.

01:20:31.012 --> 01:20:33.947
Javed? You're with him?

01:20:44.192 --> 01:20:46.353
First you order a dishwasher.

01:20:47.829 --> 01:20:49.763
Now you want this fucking cook, huh?

01:20:49.831 --> 01:20:51.662
- I just thought-
- Shut up!

01:20:51.733 --> 01:20:55.760
<i>The cricket is on.</i>

01:20:55.837 --> 01:20:58.465
And why do you watch this shit TV?

01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:01.236
As it is I am a millionaire.

01:21:03.411 --> 01:21:06.437
Come on. I'm hungry.
Make me a sandwich.

01:21:23.231 --> 01:21:25.791
<i>I want to bet five lakh rupees</i>
<i>he'll make a century.</i>

01:21:30.538 --> 01:21:33.166
Ah! Make it seven then.

01:21:33.241 --> 01:21:35.471
Mm. Yeah.

01:21:37.712 --> 01:21:39.646
Come away with me.

01:21:41.249 --> 01:21:43.774
Away where?

01:21:43.852 --> 01:21:46.320
And live on what?

01:21:50.358 --> 01:21:51.848
Love.

01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:58.224
Come away with me... now.

01:22:05.774 --> 01:22:07.765
Mm!

01:22:12.213 --> 01:22:15.182
Salim will help us.

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:17.445
Salim?

01:22:18.486 --> 01:22:20.784
You still believe in Salim?

01:22:24.326 --> 01:22:27.090
Jamal, I'll be gone soon anyway.

01:22:27.162 --> 01:22:29.494
We're getting out of Bombay.

01:22:31.733 --> 01:22:33.667
Where?

01:22:33.735 --> 01:22:36.033
- Do you think he'd tell me?
- <i> No.</i>

01:22:36.104 --> 01:22:38.595
Not the second- No!
No! No!

01:22:38.673 --> 01:22:41.233
And could that be
a hundred for Tendulkar?

01:22:41.309 --> 01:22:44.608
To the third umpire, Billy Bowden.

01:22:44.679 --> 01:22:46.613
<i>Takes the fielder on.</i>

01:22:46.681 --> 01:22:48.672
<i>In the deep.</i>
<i>That's a good throw.</i>

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.945
<i>Flat.</i>
<i>He looks confident.</i>

01:22:51.019 --> 01:22:53.749
<i>Yeah, I wouldn't be.</i>

01:22:53.822 --> 01:22:57.087
<i>Boucher seems very, very confident.</i>

01:22:58.493 --> 01:23:01.121
What is this shit?

01:23:01.196 --> 01:23:02.857
<i>Get out.</i>

01:23:02.931 --> 01:23:04.990
Get out!

01:23:12.173 --> 01:23:14.664
Now go... before he kills us both.

01:23:16.211 --> 01:23:19.237
- You want to do something for me?
- Anything.

01:23:19.314 --> 01:23:22.977
- Then forget me.
- What? No.

01:23:23.051 --> 01:23:25.246
I'll wait...

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.256
at the V.T. station 5:00 every day
until you come.

01:23:33.061 --> 01:23:35.552
I love you.

01:23:36.631 --> 01:23:38.895
So what?

01:23:38.967 --> 01:23:41.458
It's too late, Jamal.
Now go.

01:23:51.846 --> 01:23:54.644
<i>So, Jamal, which cricketer</i>
<i>has scored...</i>

01:23:54.716 --> 01:23:57.651
the most first class
centuries in history?

01:23:57.719 --> 01:24:00.119
"A," Sachin Tendulkar...

01:24:00.188 --> 01:24:02.179
"B," Ricky Ponting...

01:24:02.257 --> 01:24:04.191
"C," Michael Slater...

01:24:04.259 --> 01:24:06.955
or "D,"Jack Hobbs?

01:24:09.264 --> 01:24:13.257
<i>But remember, if you answer wrong...</i>

01:24:13.334 --> 01:24:17.600
you lose everything-
just like this.

01:24:20.074 --> 01:24:22.508
So do you want to do this?

01:24:39.561 --> 01:24:41.927
<i>That's the way, Jamal!</i>

01:24:47.035 --> 01:24:49.265
Dreams of so many...

01:24:50.939 --> 01:24:53.100
on the floor.

01:26:10.718 --> 01:26:12.982
Latika. Latika!

01:26:16.391 --> 01:26:18.450
Latika!

01:26:26.968 --> 01:26:28.333
Latika!

01:26:35.143 --> 01:26:39.307
Latika! Latika!

01:26:45.486 --> 01:26:47.954
Jamal!

01:26:48.022 --> 01:26:52.322
<i>Jamal! Jamal!</i>

01:27:10.545 --> 01:27:13.878
Jamal!

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:18.614
<i>Jamal!</i>

01:27:21.923 --> 01:27:26.155
Latika!

01:27:28.596 --> 01:27:31.588
Latika! Latika!

01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:38.168
<i> Time for a commercial break,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:27:40.942 --> 01:27:44.207
<i> I know, I know.</i>
<i>I can't stand the tension either.</i>

01:27:44.278 --> 01:27:46.303
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

01:27:55.223 --> 01:27:57.885
Guy from the slums...

01:27:57.959 --> 01:28:00.553
<i>becomes a millionaire overnight.</i>

01:28:00.628 --> 01:28:04.394
Do you know who's the only
other person who's done that?

01:28:05.933 --> 01:28:08.629
Me.

01:28:08.703 --> 01:28:11.695
I know what it feels like.

01:28:11.773 --> 01:28:14.401
<i>I know what you've been through.</i>

01:28:14.475 --> 01:28:17.273
I'm not going to become a millionaire.

01:28:17.345 --> 01:28:19.279
I don't know the answer.

01:28:19.347 --> 01:28:23.078
You've said that before, yeah.

01:28:23.151 --> 01:28:26.587
No. Really.
This time I don't.

01:28:26.654 --> 01:28:29.623
<i>Come on. You can't take</i>
<i>the money and run now.</i>

01:28:31.993 --> 01:28:34.461
You're on the edge of history, kid.

01:28:34.529 --> 01:28:37.123
I don't see what else I can do.

01:28:37.198 --> 01:28:40.065
Maybe it's written, my friend.

01:28:40.134 --> 01:28:42.068
I don't know.

01:28:42.136 --> 01:28:46.197
<i>I just get some kind of karmic feeling</i>
<i>you're going to win this.</i>

01:28:46.274 --> 01:28:48.333
Trust me, Jamal.

01:28:50.178 --> 01:28:52.669
You're going to win.

01:29:24.178 --> 01:29:26.908
<i> Stand by, everyone.</i>
<i>We're on live in 30.</i>

01:29:26.981 --> 01:29:30.473
<i> Get him back</i>
<i>on the floor, yeah. Prem is waiting.</i>

01:29:30.551 --> 01:29:32.883
<i> Yeah, he's coming. He's coming.</i>
<i>I'm just getting him.</i>

01:29:34.088 --> 01:29:37.580
<i>Go first.</i>
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

01:29:43.531 --> 01:29:48.161
Do the right thing, and in approximately
three minutes, you'll be as famous as me.

01:29:48.236 --> 01:29:50.636
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

01:29:50.705 --> 01:29:52.798
And as rich as me.

01:29:54.342 --> 01:29:56.276
Almost.

01:29:56.344 --> 01:29:59.142
<i>Five seconds. Four, three-</i>

01:29:59.213 --> 01:30:02.979
<i>From rags to raja.</i>
<i>It's your destiny.</i>

01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:06.019
<i>We are on!</i>
<i>Applause and music, please!</i>

01:30:15.029 --> 01:30:17.361
Jib move out.
Cut to two.

01:30:19.433 --> 01:30:22.698
Welcome back to
<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:25.102
In the chair tonight is Jamal Malik.

01:30:25.173 --> 01:30:27.403
- <i> Yeah!</i>
- As if you don't know.

01:30:27.475 --> 01:30:31.343
<i>For 10 million rupees-</i>

01:30:31.412 --> 01:30:34.040
The question once again:

01:30:36.184 --> 01:30:41.417
Which cricketer has scored
the most first class centuries in history?

01:30:43.224 --> 01:30:47.058
- I know it isn't Sachin Tendulkar.
- That's a start.

01:30:47.128 --> 01:30:49.119
<i>So it could be Ricky Ponting...</i>

01:30:49.197 --> 01:30:52.530
Jack Hobbs or Michael Slater.

01:30:54.836 --> 01:30:57.862
I'll use a lifeline- fifty-fifty.

01:30:57.939 --> 01:31:02.000
Okay. Computer, take away
two wrong answers, please.

01:31:05.179 --> 01:31:08.706
Well, you were right
about Sachin Tendulkar.

01:31:08.783 --> 01:31:12.184
That leaves you a fifty-fifty choice, Jamal.
"B," Ricky Ponting...

01:31:12.253 --> 01:31:14.949
or "D,"Jack Hobbs?

01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:19.250
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:31:19.327 --> 01:31:22.262
Decision time.

01:31:22.330 --> 01:31:25.697
For 10 million rupees.

01:31:25.766 --> 01:31:29.133
"B," Ricky Ponting...

01:31:29.203 --> 01:31:32.263
<i>or "D,"Jack Hobbs?</i>

01:31:45.186 --> 01:31:47.177
"D."

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.994
Not "B"?

01:31:56.063 --> 01:31:57.997
<i>"B,"Ricky Ponting...</i>

01:31:58.065 --> 01:32:01.057
<i>the Australian great cricketer?</i>

01:32:03.037 --> 01:32:05.665
"D,"Jack Hobbs.

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:08.106
You know?

01:32:11.012 --> 01:32:14.573
So it could be "B," Ricky Ponting.

01:32:14.649 --> 01:32:17.482
Or "D,"Jack Hobbs.

01:32:19.353 --> 01:32:22.447
<i>Final answer- "D."</i>

01:32:23.858 --> 01:32:27.259
<i>Computer-ji, "D."</i>
<i>"D"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

01:32:27.328 --> 01:32:29.796
<i>"D"lock kiya-jaye.</i>
<i>Computer-ji, "D"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

01:32:41.208 --> 01:32:43.005
With...

01:32:43.077 --> 01:32:47.639
197 first class centuries,
the answer is...

01:32:51.953 --> 01:32:54.183
"D,"Jack Hobbs!

01:32:55.556 --> 01:32:58.821
Jamal Malik-

01:32:58.893 --> 01:33:01.088
millionaire!

01:33:06.133 --> 01:33:08.795
<i> I cannot believe my eyes,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen!</i>

01:33:08.869 --> 01:33:12.032
This needs a dance, man!
Come on! Come on!

01:33:15.009 --> 01:33:17.500
Well done. Well done.

01:33:39.533 --> 01:33:43.060
<i>So, are you ready...</i>

01:33:43.137 --> 01:33:45.367
for the final question?

01:33:45.439 --> 01:33:50.001
For 20 million rupees.

01:33:52.847 --> 01:33:54.781
No.

01:33:54.849 --> 01:33:57.750
But maybe it's written, no?

01:33:59.387 --> 01:34:00.911
Maybe.

01:34:02.356 --> 01:34:06.520
<i>Okay, the final question</i>
<i>on</i> Who Wants to Be a-

01:34:10.297 --> 01:34:14.028
What a show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:34:14.101 --> 01:34:17.434
What a show!
Join us tomorrow night to see...

01:34:17.505 --> 01:34:19.939
<i>if Jamal Malik has made</i>
<i>the biggest mistake of his life...</i>

01:34:20.007 --> 01:34:24.000
<i>or just won the biggest prize</i>
<i>in the history of Indian television.</i>

01:34:24.078 --> 01:34:26.012
- This way.
- Yeah. Let's just-

01:34:29.417 --> 01:34:31.351
Come, Jamal.

01:34:33.754 --> 01:34:35.688
Great show.

01:34:38.826 --> 01:34:41.158
See you tomorrow, okay?
Be on time.

01:34:41.228 --> 01:34:43.458
- Yeah.
- Bye.

01:34:47.501 --> 01:34:50.732
Careful.

01:34:50.805 --> 01:34:53.774
What's going on?

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.611
- He's a cheat.
- How do you know he's cheating?

01:35:06.253 --> 01:35:08.187
Bloody village boy.

01:35:08.255 --> 01:35:11.247
I fed him the wrong answer,
and that little shit got it right.

01:35:11.325 --> 01:35:13.259
You gave him an answer?

01:35:13.327 --> 01:35:15.488
Not exactly.

01:35:15.563 --> 01:35:19.590
But how does it matter?
It's- It's my show.

01:35:19.667 --> 01:35:21.897
It's my fucking show!

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:35.879
It is bizarrely plausible.

01:35:37.451 --> 01:35:42.548
- And yet-
- Because I'm a slumdog, a chai wallah...

01:35:42.623 --> 01:35:45.956
- I'm a liar, right?
- <i>Most of you are.</i>

01:35:46.026 --> 01:35:50.190
But you are not a liar, Mr. Malik.
That's for sure.

01:35:50.264 --> 01:35:52.198
You're too truthful.

01:35:55.202 --> 01:35:57.193
We're done.

01:36:00.875 --> 01:36:03.241
I don't know where
they've taken her.

01:36:09.316 --> 01:36:10.874
Latika.

01:36:19.059 --> 01:36:20.993
I went on the show...

01:36:21.061 --> 01:36:23.291
because I thought she'd be watching.

01:36:37.044 --> 01:36:38.978
<i>Did Jamal Malik...</i>

01:36:39.046 --> 01:36:42.777
<i>an uneducated 18-year-old boy</i>
<i>from the slums of Mumbai...</i>

01:36:42.850 --> 01:36:46.547
win one crore by fair means
or foul play?

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:49.555
<i>In the crowd around me,</i>
<i>there is an even bigger question.</i>

01:36:49.623 --> 01:36:53.616
<i>Will he be back tonight to play for another</i>
<i>20 million rupees?</i>

01:36:53.694 --> 01:36:56.060
<i>Jamal Malik-</i>

01:37:29.496 --> 01:37:31.930
<i>Hey, you, come here. Give me a kiss.</i>

01:37:31.999 --> 01:37:33.933
- <i>Come here.</i>
- <i> You want it?</i>

01:37:34.001 --> 01:37:37.095
<i>Yeah, I want it. Come on, girls!</i>

01:37:55.422 --> 01:37:58.289
<i> And if there wasn't</i>
<i>enough drama in a contestant...</i>

01:37:58.359 --> 01:38:00.919
<i>reaching the final question,</i>
<i>Jamal Malik...</i>

01:38:00.995 --> 01:38:03.429
<i>was last night arrested...</i>

01:38:03.497 --> 01:38:06.523
- <i>on suspicion of fraud.</i>
- <i> That guy-</i>

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.592
He will never give up.

01:38:09.670 --> 01:38:11.797
Never.

01:38:13.641 --> 01:38:15.632
Crazy <i>chutiye.</i>

01:38:24.218 --> 01:38:27.210
- Go.
- But-

01:38:27.288 --> 01:38:29.313
Just drive.

01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:31.654
There won't be another chance.

01:38:36.897 --> 01:38:38.990
He will kill you.

01:38:43.103 --> 01:38:45.435
I'll take care of him.

01:38:47.908 --> 01:38:49.842
Salim.

01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:52.003
I can't.

01:38:56.417 --> 01:38:58.817
You have to.

01:39:05.626 --> 01:39:07.890
For God's sake, hold on to this.

01:39:12.232 --> 01:39:16.100
And for what I've done,
please forgive me.

01:39:27.815 --> 01:39:31.444
Have a good life.

01:40:00.681 --> 01:40:03.707
You're back on the show.

01:40:33.046 --> 01:40:34.479
Come on!

01:40:34.548 --> 01:40:36.311
Come on.

01:41:13.086 --> 01:41:16.249
<i> The nation is gripped</i>
<i>with</i> Millionaire <i>fever tonight...</i>

01:41:16.323 --> 01:41:21.488
<i>as Jamal Malik, an uneducated young man</i>
<i>from the Juhu slum in Mumbai...</i>

01:41:21.562 --> 01:41:23.792
<i>won a staggering</i>
<i>10 million rupees...</i>

01:41:23.864 --> 01:41:27.356
<i>on the television show</i>
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

01:41:27.434 --> 01:41:30.961
<i>An estimated 90 million people</i>
<i>will tune in tonight...</i>

01:41:31.038 --> 01:41:33.905
<i>to see if he can go one stage</i>
<i>further and win...</i>

01:41:33.974 --> 01:41:37.535
<i>an unthinkable 20 million rupees.</i>

01:41:37.611 --> 01:41:40.079
Come on!

01:42:00.934 --> 01:42:04.335
Where is everyone?
Get back in here.

01:42:04.404 --> 01:42:06.895
<i>Get back to work.</i>
<i>Now.</i>

01:42:09.276 --> 01:42:11.073
<i>Chai wallah?</i>

01:42:32.099 --> 01:42:37.628
Welcome back
to <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

01:42:37.704 --> 01:42:39.638
I can safely say that tonight...

01:42:39.706 --> 01:42:43.198
is the biggest night
of both our lives.

01:42:43.277 --> 01:42:45.472
<i>Jamal Malik, the call center</i>
<i>worker from Mumbai...</i>

01:42:45.546 --> 01:42:48.640
<i>has already won a cool 10 million.</i>

01:42:48.715 --> 01:42:51.115
<i>He can walk away</i>
<i>with that in his pocket...</i>

01:42:51.184 --> 01:42:53.982
or make the biggest gamble
in television history...

01:42:54.054 --> 01:42:56.147
and go for the final question...

01:42:56.223 --> 01:43:00.353
and a staggering 20 million rupees.

01:43:01.995 --> 01:43:05.556
Are you ready for that question?

01:43:05.632 --> 01:43:08.100
- Yes.
- <i>Jamal!</i>

01:43:21.682 --> 01:43:24.981
<i>Big reader, are you, Jamal?</i>

01:43:25.052 --> 01:43:28.078
I can read.

01:43:28.155 --> 01:43:30.623
Lucky.

01:43:31.858 --> 01:43:35.294
In Alexander Dumas's book...

01:43:35.362 --> 01:43:38.354
<i>The Three Musketeers...</i>

01:43:38.432 --> 01:43:43.495
two of the musketeers are
called Athos and Porthos.

01:43:43.570 --> 01:43:46.164
What was the name
of the third musketeer?

01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:54.045
<i> "A,"Aramis,</i>
<i>"B,"Cardinal Richelieu...</i>

01:43:54.114 --> 01:43:57.709
"C," D'Artagnan...

01:43:57.784 --> 01:43:59.979
or "D," Planchet?

01:44:00.053 --> 01:44:03.819
Athos!

01:44:07.194 --> 01:44:10.891
<i>Final question for 20 million rupees,</i>
<i>and he's smiling.</i>

01:44:10.964 --> 01:44:13.455
I guess you know the answer.

01:44:13.533 --> 01:44:16.001
Do you believe it? I don't.

01:44:16.069 --> 01:44:19.038
You don't?

01:44:20.974 --> 01:44:24.842
<i>So you take the 10 million and walk?</i>

01:44:24.911 --> 01:44:27.072
No.

01:44:27.147 --> 01:44:30.981
I'll play.

01:44:31.051 --> 01:44:33.815
Let me remind you, Jamal.

01:44:33.887 --> 01:44:36.685
If you get the answer wrong...

01:44:36.757 --> 01:44:39.317
you lose everything.

01:44:39.393 --> 01:44:43.989
Ten million rupees, Jamal.

01:44:44.064 --> 01:44:46.191
<i>It's a fortune.</i>

01:44:47.868 --> 01:44:51.565
I'd like to phone a friend.

01:44:51.638 --> 01:44:53.970
We're going to the wire.

01:44:54.041 --> 01:44:56.942
The final lifeline.

01:44:57.010 --> 01:45:00.309
Here we go.

01:45:03.517 --> 01:45:06.384
It's ringing.

01:45:12.659 --> 01:45:15.457
Who is it?

01:45:15.529 --> 01:45:19.090
<i>It's my brother's number, but-</i>

01:45:19.166 --> 01:45:22.761
The kind of brother who'd go for a walk...

01:45:22.836 --> 01:45:25.464
on a 20 million rupee question?

01:45:25.539 --> 01:45:28.064
It's the only number I know.

01:45:55.869 --> 01:45:58.997
You are on your own, Jamal.

01:46:01.475 --> 01:46:04.000
Hello?

01:46:07.681 --> 01:46:10.241
Hello, Jamal?

01:46:10.317 --> 01:46:13.411
I'm guessing
that isn't your brother.

01:46:15.155 --> 01:46:17.316
<i>This is?</i>

01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:20.018
My name is Latika.

01:46:20.093 --> 01:46:23.085
<i>Okay, Latika. You want to hear</i>
<i>the question one more time?</i>

01:46:23.163 --> 01:46:25.461
And let's be clear about this.

01:46:25.532 --> 01:46:29.764
<i>Twenty million rupees ride on your answer.</i>
<i>You have 30 seconds.</i>

01:46:29.836 --> 01:46:31.463
- Latika!
- Jamal...

01:46:31.538 --> 01:46:33.369
- <i>please read out the question...</i>
- Salim!

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.499
<i>to Latika now.</i>

01:46:38.712 --> 01:46:40.942
<i>Is that really you?</i>

01:46:41.014 --> 01:46:44.108
- <i> Yes.</i>
- The question, Jamal. The question.

01:46:44.184 --> 01:46:48.211
In Alexander Dumas's book,
<i>The Three Musketeers...</i>

01:46:48.288 --> 01:46:50.779
<i>two of the musketeers are</i>
<i>called Athos and Porthos.</i>

01:46:50.857 --> 01:46:52.848
<i>What was the name</i>
<i>of the third musketeer?</i>

01:46:52.926 --> 01:46:56.657
<i>Was it "A,"Aramis,</i>
<i>"B,"Cardinal Richelieu...</i>

01:46:56.730 --> 01:46:59.790
"C," D'Artagnan, "D," Planchet?

01:46:59.866 --> 01:47:03.165
- Fifteen seconds.
- Where are you?

01:47:03.236 --> 01:47:05.227
I'm safe.

01:47:05.305 --> 01:47:09.708
<i> Ten seconds.</i>
<i>Latika, what do you think?</i>

01:47:12.946 --> 01:47:14.880
I don't know.

01:47:17.150 --> 01:47:19.345
<i>I've never known.</i>

01:47:19.419 --> 01:47:22.479
<i>Jamal-</i>

01:47:30.831 --> 01:47:34.733
You really are
on your own now, Jamal.

01:47:34.801 --> 01:47:40.103
Your final answer
for 20 million rupees.

01:47:51.852 --> 01:47:54.446
"A."

01:47:55.622 --> 01:47:57.556
"A," because?

01:47:59.025 --> 01:48:01.892
Just... because.

01:48:01.962 --> 01:48:03.896
Hey, Salim!

01:48:06.099 --> 01:48:08.727
<i> Final answer?</i>

01:48:11.104 --> 01:48:15.768
Yes.
Final answer- "A," Aramis.

01:48:17.210 --> 01:48:19.201
<i>Computer-ji,</i>
<i>"A"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

01:48:22.315 --> 01:48:25.614
<i> Salim!</i>

01:48:25.685 --> 01:48:27.619
<i>Salim!</i>

01:48:27.687 --> 01:48:30.053
<i>Jamal Malik.</i>

01:48:30.123 --> 01:48:32.387
Call center assistant from Mumbai.

01:48:32.459 --> 01:48:34.450
Chai wallah.

01:48:34.527 --> 01:48:36.757
<i>For two crore-</i>

01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:39.128
twenty million rupees.

01:48:39.199 --> 01:48:42.600
You were asked who the third
musketeer was-

01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:45.433
<i>in the novel by Alexander Dumas.</i>

01:48:45.505 --> 01:48:48.235
<i>You answered "A"...</i>

01:48:48.308 --> 01:48:50.776
Aramis...

01:48:50.844 --> 01:48:52.903
which is...

01:48:52.979 --> 01:48:55.277
I have to tell you...

01:48:55.348 --> 01:48:57.282
the right answer!

01:49:23.143 --> 01:49:25.703
Jamal Malik!

01:49:25.779 --> 01:49:27.713
Double crorepati!

01:49:30.784 --> 01:49:32.718
God is great.

01:49:36.823 --> 01:49:38.882
<i>What a night!</i>

01:49:38.959 --> 01:49:41.120
What a night!

01:49:51.638 --> 01:49:55.506
<i> Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:49:55.575 --> 01:49:57.509
we are present here...

01:49:57.577 --> 01:50:02.014
<i>to create... history!</i>

01:50:02.082 --> 01:50:04.016
Well done!

01:51:24.064 --> 01:51:27.124
Yea!

01:52:12.445 --> 01:52:14.379
I knew you'd be watching.

01:52:15.682 --> 01:52:18.549
I thought we'd meet again
only in death.

01:53:03.930 --> 01:53:05.898
This is our destiny.

01:53:08.902 --> 01:53:10.836
Kiss me.

01:58:04.464 --> 01:58:07.058
<i># Hey #</i>

01:58:07.133 --> 01:58:08.623
