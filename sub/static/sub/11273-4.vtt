00:07.560 --> 00:10.597
Hey, everybody,
I got a letter from my dog.

00:11.059 --> 00:13.175
Pretty spiffy handwriting for a dog.

00:13.434 --> 00:15.072
Well, it's not actually
from my dog.

00:15.309 --> 00:17.903
My mom writes the letters
as if they're from my dog, Truman.

00:18.433 --> 00:20.867
Weird beyond imagination, Norm.

00:21.641 --> 00:23.040
Listen to this:.

00:23.266 --> 00:25.905
"Dear Woody,
Boy, what a great day I had.

00:26.182 --> 00:27.740
I pulled all the laundry
off the line,

00:27.974 --> 00:29.487
chewed up your father's
bowling shoes,

00:29.723 --> 00:33.477
and grabbed a Yankee pot roast
off the table. Yum, yum."

00:34.348 --> 00:35.417
Isn't that cute?

00:36.139 --> 00:38.130
The mutt eats better than I do.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.660
"By the way, now that you're
not here to keep me in line,

00:40.930 --> 00:42.841
your mother's thinking
about putting me to sleep.

00:43.096 --> 00:44.415
I certainly wouldn't blame her,

00:44.638 --> 00:47.311
and I don't want you to either
after I'm gone."

00:48.304 --> 00:51.341
Sam, cover me.
I gotta make a phone call.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:04.050 --> 02:06.848
- Drinks are up.
- Right away.

02:07.133 --> 02:10.408
I need a vodka Gibson, up,
a bloody mary,

02:10.716 --> 02:13.469
a Johnnie Walker black,
two Beck's, and change for a 20.

02:14.299 --> 02:15.698
- Change for a 20, Sam.
- Damn!

02:15.924 --> 02:18.484
Carla's been on the phone
for two hours here.

02:18.757 --> 02:22.147
She probably got an obscene
phone call and won't let him off.

02:23.464 --> 02:25.853
Okay, five, ten, ten, 20.

02:26.922 --> 02:29.834
Can you believe it, Sam?
How far I've come?

02:30.130 --> 02:33.918
Right before your eyes,
I've turned into a waitressing machine.

02:34.254 --> 02:35.448
Even in this pandemonium,

02:35.671 --> 02:38.026
I have everything
perfectly under control.

02:40.378 --> 02:42.369
There you go.

02:46.294 --> 02:49.127
And here's your
change for the 20.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.137
Thank you.

02:51.752 --> 02:53.026
See what I mean?

02:53.251 --> 02:56.129
Always sit at her station.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.589
Did you hear that, Sam?

02:59.834 --> 03:01.426
Still busy.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.399
Sam, I've got to get home

03:03.625 --> 03:06.185
and start preparing for that interview
for the part-time job.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.096
What interview?

03:08.332 --> 03:10.288
You know, the teaching assistant
at the college.

03:10.582 --> 03:12.061
Oh, right.
All right, go on, take off.

03:12.290 --> 03:13.928
Woody and l
will take care of you here.

03:14.207 --> 03:17.279
Listen, don't fall in that same
trap you did with Sumner.

03:19.039 --> 03:22.827
Sam, my intimate relationship
with Sumner

03:23.164 --> 03:27.715
had nothing to do with the fact
that I was his teaching assistant.

03:28.079 --> 03:31.230
Sumner took advantage
of a naive young coed.

03:31.537 --> 03:34.097
I have learned since then,
from bitter experience.

03:34.370 --> 03:37.009
I am older, wiser,

03:37.286 --> 03:40.198
and I have a lot more units
under my belt.

03:42.661 --> 03:45.380
Hey, Woody, give me a refill,
would you?

03:45.702 --> 03:47.340
Coming up.

03:47.868 --> 03:50.018
You know, Mr. Peterson,
you're amazing.

03:50.284 --> 03:51.842
How do you keep
putting them away?

03:52.118 --> 03:54.951
Well, it's all done with mirrors, son.

03:55.950 --> 03:59.420
I just never look in one.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.394
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey.

04:02.616 --> 04:05.926
Buckle your seatbelts and get ready
for a blast into the unknown.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.277
I've got a phenomenon here
which, well, I'm sure will inspire

04:09.573 --> 04:13.009
the legendary Jack Palance
to utter the infamous words,

04:13.323 --> 04:14.836
"Believe it or not."

04:15.572 --> 04:17.688
Get a load of this.

04:18.322 --> 04:21.553
- What's that?
- Potato, right?

04:22.405 --> 04:25.363
It's no ordinary, common,
garden-variety russet, Norm.

04:25.654 --> 04:28.691
Though, I'm proud to say,
I did grow it myself.

04:30.195 --> 04:32.914
It's the spitting image
of Richard Milhous Nixon. Look.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.495
What, you find this amusing?

04:38.735 --> 04:41.966
No. No, I find it
historically significant, Cliff.

04:42.777 --> 04:44.130
Look, look at the eye.

04:44.401 --> 04:47.279
Well, all right, forget about the third
one there, but look at those eyes.

04:47.567 --> 04:50.001
The ski-jump nose, the jowls, huh?

04:50.275 --> 04:53.711
He's even got a little bit of sweat
there on the upper lip.

04:54.025 --> 04:55.344
Come on, man.

04:55.858 --> 04:57.769
All right, maybe this
will help you out.

04:58.274 --> 05:00.947
I am not a crook.

05:01.899 --> 05:04.049
Sorry, it still doesn't
look like Nixon.

05:04.357 --> 05:06.996
Sure sounds like him though.

05:08.856 --> 05:09.971
Hi, guys.

05:10.231 --> 05:13.667
Hey, Carla, I got a potato here
looks just like Richard Nixon.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.950
Big deal. Find one that doesn't,
then get back to me.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.322
We were really hopping around here
a couple hours ago, you know.

05:24.604 --> 05:25.878
So why didn't you
call me sooner?

05:26.103 --> 05:27.900
I tried to, but your phone
was busy.

05:28.186 --> 05:31.542
Oh, sorry. My oldest must have been
talking to his girlfriend.

05:32.061 --> 05:34.256
- Where's Diane anyway?
- Oh, I gave her the night off.

05:34.519 --> 05:38.194
She's trying to interview for a TA job
down at the college.

05:38.726 --> 05:42.355
She'll never get it.
She's a big A with no Ts.

05:44.059 --> 05:45.970
So Anthony has got himself
a girlfriend, huh?

05:46.350 --> 05:47.624
It's sickening, Sam.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.523
Everyday it's,
"Annie this. Annie that."

05:50.808 --> 05:53.481
Walks around the apartment
all moony-eyed.

05:53.766 --> 05:56.405
I think my kid's
turned into a weenie.

05:56.682 --> 05:58.320
Well, don't be too hard
on the lad, Carla.

05:58.557 --> 06:00.548
You know, men will
do some pretty strange things

06:00.806 --> 06:02.478
to have a woman by their side.

06:02.723 --> 06:05.237
In your case, inflate one.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.998
You know who I hold
responsible for this? Nick.

06:13.471 --> 06:15.621
- Who's Nick?
- He's Anthony's father.

06:15.887 --> 06:17.798
His biological father.

06:18.304 --> 06:21.023
Wow, a scientist.

06:24.345 --> 06:26.415
You know, what my boy
needs now

06:26.678 --> 06:29.067
is just a little adult male
companionship

06:29.344 --> 06:30.777
to snap him out of this.

06:31.010 --> 06:32.159
How about it, Sam?

06:32.635 --> 06:35.229
Come on, find somebody else.
Call Nick.

06:35.551 --> 06:37.621
Come on. You know Nick's idea
of fatherhood:

06:37.884 --> 06:40.478
When the egg splits,
so does he.

06:41.842 --> 06:44.675
- Come on.
- What exactly would I have to do?

06:44.966 --> 06:47.082
Just take him out and show him
a great time, you know?

06:47.341 --> 06:48.979
A real night on the town.

06:49.216 --> 06:52.208
Wild, crazy, borderline illegal.

06:52.507 --> 06:55.340
I guess I could handle that.
Yeah, why not?

06:55.631 --> 06:58.429
It's about time the kid learned
how much fun it was to play the field.

06:58.714 --> 07:00.466
- Right.
- Hey, wait just a second here.

07:00.714 --> 07:03.023
Let's not give marriage
a bad rap, huh?

07:03.297 --> 07:04.969
It's a fine institution.

07:05.213 --> 07:07.363
Matter of fact, go ahead
and ask any single man here

07:07.630 --> 07:10.098
if he wouldn't gladly trade places
with me for a night.

07:12.212 --> 07:13.884
Anybody?

07:14.462 --> 07:15.861
Please.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.315
One night.

07:17.545 --> 07:21.333
Oh, come on, fellas. I'm offering
transportation and a hot meal.

07:26.044 --> 07:29.275
No, no, this is second-term Nixon.
Yeah.

07:29.585 --> 07:33.703
Yeah, this tater is definitely showing
the strain of Watergate here.

07:35.126 --> 07:36.798
Not--? Not newsworthy?

07:37.042 --> 07:39.510
Oh, well, excuse me for living there,
buddy boy.

07:39.791 --> 07:43.579
Yeah, I'll call you back
when my potato marries a rock star!

07:45.082 --> 07:47.073
New York Times, my foot!

07:47.332 --> 07:50.369
If the news doesn't come out
of Moscow, they're not interested.

07:50.665 --> 07:52.576
Hey, what do you think?
You like the game?

07:52.831 --> 07:54.708
Yeah, that was great.
Where's your phone, Sammo?

07:54.956 --> 07:56.548
Oh, come on, give her a break,
will you?

07:56.789 --> 08:00.702
You called her four times tonight.
She's probably half asleep.

08:03.663 --> 08:05.381
Cheers.

08:05.829 --> 08:07.148
Just a minute.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.103
Who you looking for?

08:09.579 --> 08:12.139
Some girl wants to talk
to the outlaw of love.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.929
She tracked me down.

08:16.411 --> 08:18.606
Hey, hey, that's Annie.
That's Annie. Let me have it.

08:18.911 --> 08:20.185
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:20.410 --> 08:23.482
He's fine, Annie,
and he'll call you tomorrow.

08:23.785 --> 08:25.776
Yes, he's still a hunk.

08:26.035 --> 08:28.071
Okay, I will. Good night.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.517
I owe you one, Sam.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.850
Anthony, consider yourself
kissed good night.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.346
Okay, you want
that root beer, huh?

08:38.658 --> 08:40.808
Great. That's me
and Annie's favourite.

08:41.073 --> 08:43.907
She loves it when I make it
come out my nose.

08:45.073 --> 08:48.110
Yeah, I know.
That always works for me too.

08:48.698 --> 08:51.007
Listen, Anthony...

08:51.531 --> 08:54.841
-...I know you like Annie a lot--
- Oh, no.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.509
I love her.

08:58.280 --> 09:01.033
Anthony, there's only two times
a man uses that word:

09:01.321 --> 09:03.152
tennis, and when he's already
paid for the room.

09:03.404 --> 09:04.598
You know what I mean?

09:05.404 --> 09:07.599
My ma, she says the same thing.

09:07.862 --> 09:10.456
She acts like we're kids
or something.

09:14.860 --> 09:17.738
I'll tell you, just between you and me--
I mean, you don't tell my ma.

09:19.068 --> 09:21.059
Me and Annie,
we're talking about getting married.

09:22.109 --> 09:24.748
- What? You get her pregnant?
- Oh, she ain't pregnant!

09:25.026 --> 09:27.540
We think that sex before marriage
is a sin.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.531
Afterwards, it's just one more
damn thing

09:29.775 --> 09:31.811
to take your pants off for,
you know?

09:34.774 --> 09:36.571
Anthony, you don't know
what you're doing.

09:36.816 --> 09:38.090
I mean, look at me, will you?

09:38.315 --> 09:41.466
I'm single.
I've got a great life going here.

09:41.815 --> 09:46.127
Look, most guys go through
their entire life with only one woman.

09:46.481 --> 09:49.996
- Yeah.
- I got three under Q.

09:52.563 --> 09:54.121
This whole book is women?

09:54.396 --> 09:55.875
This book and my life.

09:56.104 --> 09:57.776
Tell you what...

09:58.271 --> 09:59.260
...pick a name, any name.

09:59.479 --> 10:01.276
I'm gonna show you
what a no-strings good time

10:01.520 --> 10:03.078
I got at my fingertips here.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.064
Go ahead. Any name.

10:05.311 --> 10:07.108
- Beth Hollister.
- Beth Hollister.

10:07.353 --> 10:10.345
All right. Very good choice.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.522
It's a toll call, but it's worth it.

10:16.268 --> 10:19.180
Hey, Beth? Hi, it's Sam Malone.

10:19.476 --> 10:21.626
Yeah. Yeah, well, I know
it's been a long time.

10:21.892 --> 10:25.168
That's why I'm calling. I thought
maybe we'd get together tonight.

10:25.475 --> 10:29.354
Oh, no. Well, is it something
you can put off until later?

10:30.474 --> 10:31.748
No, no, no.

10:31.974 --> 10:35.091
No, I wouldn't want you to miss
your first Weight Watchers meeting.

10:36.890 --> 10:39.688
Tomorrow? Me? Well...

10:40.431 --> 10:43.707
God, Beth, I think my appendix
just burst. Will you excuse me?

10:47.097 --> 10:50.328
Being single means
you gotta think fast on your feet.

10:50.721 --> 10:52.871
Go ahead. Pick another name.
Any name.

10:55.012 --> 10:57.685
- Candy. Candy Simpson.
- Candy Simpson.

10:57.970 --> 11:01.360
Come to Papa. All right.
You're good, kid.

11:01.678 --> 11:04.238
Then again, so is Candy.

11:05.427 --> 11:06.906
Hi, is Candy in?

11:07.135 --> 11:08.534
Candy. Sam Malone.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.394
Yeah, you remember me?

11:10.676 --> 11:11.825
Yeah, all right.

11:12.051 --> 11:15.521
You still into hot fudge sundaes
for breakfast?

11:15.842 --> 11:19.232
You're not?
Oh, hell, I'm on the wrong page here.

11:20.342 --> 11:22.219
Listen...

11:22.466 --> 11:25.776
...what I want-- What I want
to say here, Candy...

11:26.091 --> 11:27.809
...is I want you.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.479
Yeah. Well, there you go.

11:31.756 --> 11:33.474
Will you excuse me for a minute?

11:34.006 --> 11:36.395
This is getting kind of hot.
I'm gonna take this in my office.

11:36.672 --> 11:37.866
Woody, you wanna hang that up?

11:38.089 --> 11:40.728
Just make yourself comfortable there.

11:42.463 --> 11:44.658
That guy's got a great life,
doesn't he?

11:44.963 --> 11:46.112
Great?

11:46.338 --> 11:48.613
He's got no one to come home to,
nobody to care about,

11:48.879 --> 11:51.268
and no reason to even get up
in the morning.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.271
And he drives a Corvette.

12:03.710 --> 12:05.780
This looks excellent,
Miss Chambers.

12:06.043 --> 12:08.113
I'd have to say,
on the basis of this résumé,

12:08.376 --> 12:10.844
that you're my leading candidate.

12:11.292 --> 12:13.408
Oh, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.862
I think you're the best
in your department,

12:16.125 --> 12:18.036
and I'd love to work with you.

12:18.291 --> 12:22.125
Well, good. Now, I do have to interview
a couple of people tomorrow,

12:22.457 --> 12:25.096
but I'll be letting you know anon.

12:25.457 --> 12:28.096
Terribly good to hear
the King's English.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.682
- Thank you for coming.
- Oh, my pleasure.

12:30.998 --> 12:34.035
Oh, by the way, I got an excellent
recommendation for you.

12:34.872 --> 12:37.306
- Recommendation?
- From Sumner Sloane.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.458
He's a colleague of mine.
You used to work for him, right?

12:40.954 --> 12:42.546
That's right.

12:42.787 --> 12:44.698
How nice of him.
Lovely man, Sumner.

12:44.995 --> 12:47.748
He gave you very high marks.

12:50.245 --> 12:53.840
- Well, goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.780
High marks?

13:00.410 --> 13:02.605
What exactly did you mean
by that?

13:02.909 --> 13:07.903
Well, among other things, that you
have an unbridled enthusiasm.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.809
I see. Goodbye.

13:17.616 --> 13:20.130
I'm a little unclear on "enthusiasm."

13:21.282 --> 13:22.761
Well, enthusiasm:

13:22.990 --> 13:25.265
That you don't mind taking on
extra duties

13:25.531 --> 13:28.364
and working overtime, if necessary.

13:32.697 --> 13:36.212
Of course that's what he meant.
What else could he mean?

13:37.446 --> 13:39.198
Goodbye.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.103
I will not sleep with you!

13:43.445 --> 13:45.117
What?

13:47.278 --> 13:49.746
Oh, my God,
I can't believe I said that.

13:50.111 --> 13:53.421
I think that concludes our interview.

13:54.693 --> 13:56.524
Dr Moffat, I'm terribly sorry.

13:56.776 --> 13:59.529
I didn't for a moment mean to imply
that you want to have sex with me.

13:59.817 --> 14:02.012
I'm sure that's the farthest thing
from your mind.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.914
Not that you don't have
a healthy interest in sex.

14:05.233 --> 14:07.349
I'm sure you think about it
all the time.

14:07.608 --> 14:09.485
Well, not all the time.
You're not obsessed.

14:09.774 --> 14:11.605
But when it comes to sex,

14:11.857 --> 14:14.325
I'm sure you could hold your own
with a man half your age.

14:17.898 --> 14:21.049
That's not to say
that you like young men.

14:21.356 --> 14:23.233
Or any men.

14:24.647 --> 14:27.366
Not that any man wouldn't be
happy to have you.

14:28.730 --> 14:31.369
As would any woman.
Except me.

14:31.813 --> 14:33.644
Although, I could be.
But I'm not.

14:33.896 --> 14:35.614
But that's not saying
that I couldn't be.

14:35.854 --> 14:39.290
This just isn't the time or the place
or the circumstance.

14:39.603 --> 14:41.833
But by that, I'm certainly not saying
that you're flabby.

14:42.103 --> 14:44.253
Why did I say that?

14:44.894 --> 14:47.613
This isn't going well, is it?

14:54.101 --> 14:57.810
Okay. All right, everybody.
Open your eyes.

15:01.558 --> 15:03.435
What's--? What's so funny?

15:03.725 --> 15:06.364
A blue suit with a brown tie?

15:06.683 --> 15:09.880
Well, hey, I did the best I could,
you know.

15:10.182 --> 15:13.538
It's not easy coming up with
a Ken doll on short notice.

15:13.848 --> 15:16.157
I wonder if you guys realize
how limited his wardrobe is.

15:16.473 --> 15:18.111
Now, Barbie's is
much more extensive.

15:18.347 --> 15:21.225
She's got her own car,
little high heels.

15:21.514 --> 15:23.266
Cliff. Listen to me, Cliff.

15:23.513 --> 15:24.946
You're my best friend, okay?

15:25.221 --> 15:28.850
If the situation were reversed,
I'd want you to say this to me.

15:29.221 --> 15:32.019
You've gone completely
off the deep end.

15:32.512 --> 15:33.991
You've always been
kind of a weird guy,

15:34.220 --> 15:35.892
but this is just a little bit
too much.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.840
I want you to look what you've done
and think about this, Cliff.

15:40.219 --> 15:45.339
You've knocked the head off a doll
and put a potato in its place.

15:46.177 --> 15:50.534
And you actually want people
to, like, come and know this.

15:53.342 --> 15:55.651
Well, yeah, I guess you're right,
Normie.

15:55.925 --> 15:57.119
Yeah.

15:57.342 --> 15:59.173
Been taking it
a little bit too seriously.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.655
I've been under some
strain lately and...

16:01.924 --> 16:03.073
It's okay, it's okay.

16:03.299 --> 16:06.371
Thanks. You know, thanks for
pulling in those reins and saying,

16:06.673 --> 16:09.062
"Whoa, Paint,
you're working up a froth."

16:13.381 --> 16:15.736
Hey, how's Anthony doing, Carla?

16:16.005 --> 16:17.996
I hope he didn't break
little Annie's heart.

16:18.255 --> 16:20.769
But then again,
he did see life in the Sammy lane.

16:22.379 --> 16:25.530
Oh, how do you do that? How do you
make your eyes shake like that?

16:27.129 --> 16:30.087
Anthony's talking about
getting married!

16:33.961 --> 16:36.156
I don't know what happened
after he left here,

16:36.419 --> 16:37.693
but up until that point,

16:37.919 --> 16:40.513
Annie had "Destination Dump City"
written all over her.

16:40.793 --> 16:43.387
Yeah, well, he said he'd only been
thinking about getting married

16:43.710 --> 16:45.541
until last night
when you changed his mind.

16:45.793 --> 16:47.749
No way did he want to end up,
and I quote,

16:48.001 --> 16:50.310
"A lonely old skirt-chaser like Sam."

16:50.625 --> 16:51.853
Blasphemy.

16:52.542 --> 16:53.975
What did you tell my kid, huh?

16:54.625 --> 16:58.823
Well, basically, why buy the cow
when you can get the milk for free?

16:59.582 --> 17:01.334
Well, I'll tell you why.

17:01.582 --> 17:04.050
Companionship,
warmth on a cold night,

17:04.330 --> 17:06.606
someone to share
your old age with.

17:06.873 --> 17:08.943
You think he should marry her?

17:10.039 --> 17:12.233
I thought we were talking
about a cow.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.968
- Hey, Ma!
- Hello, Mrs Tortelli.

17:20.287 --> 17:22.198
Vixen.

17:22.619 --> 17:25.498
- Nice to see you too.
- What are you doing here?

17:26.286 --> 17:30.040
Look, Ma, I don't like us being
all mad at each other.

17:31.077 --> 17:32.556
You know I love you.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.423
So let's be buds.

17:35.077 --> 17:36.305
What do you want?

17:36.952 --> 17:39.147
I don't want nothing.

17:40.284 --> 17:43.799
Except for you to sign
this consent form, Ma.

17:45.075 --> 17:46.394
Consent?

17:46.617 --> 17:48.369
You want me to sign
a consent form?

17:48.616 --> 17:52.165
Yeah. Annie's parents
already agreed to sign it, Ma.

17:52.533 --> 17:55.047
Sure, no problem.
I'll sign a consent form.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.798
This is my new way
of signing my name.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.784
- Ma!
- No! You're only 16.

17:59.073 --> 18:00.426
You were pregnant
when you were 16.

18:00.698 --> 18:03.417
Yeah, but I wasn't stupid enough
to be married.

18:04.989 --> 18:08.026
Come on, Anthony. Let's just take
the bus to Jersey to see your old man.

18:08.322 --> 18:10.199
You only need
one parent's permission.

18:10.488 --> 18:12.240
Oh, forget him.
My father's a bum.

18:12.529 --> 18:14.838
Hey, don't you talk
about your father that way.

18:15.154 --> 18:18.783
- Okay, he's a sleazy bum.
- That's better.

18:19.237 --> 18:20.431
But I'll tell you this, Ma:

18:20.653 --> 18:22.564
If I don't get your consent,
I'll get his,

18:22.820 --> 18:26.051
because one way or another,
I am marrying Annie.

18:26.736 --> 18:30.172
And I was hoping that I could have
Annie as my lovely wife

18:30.485 --> 18:31.964
and still keep my mother.

18:33.735 --> 18:36.295
Ma, don't make me make a choice.

18:37.026 --> 18:39.586
Come on, Anthony,
you don't mean that.

18:39.859 --> 18:42.817
He's a proud man, Mrs Tortelli.

18:43.108 --> 18:46.862
I guess that's why I love him
more than any man I've ever known.

18:47.316 --> 18:49.068
Isn't she great, Ma?

18:49.316 --> 18:50.590
Yeah.

18:50.815 --> 18:52.407
I'm not losing a son,

18:52.648 --> 18:54.001
I'm gaining your face.

18:55.315 --> 18:56.907
You're not making
any points here, Ma.

18:57.148 --> 18:59.184
- What am I supposed to do, Sam?
- Just calm down.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.918
I gotta stop this.

19:01.147 --> 19:02.978
I can't believe they're serious.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.103
I can't believe that
any son of Nick Tortelli

19:05.355 --> 19:08.586
would even think about getting married
without a bun in some oven.

19:10.437 --> 19:13.554
Sam, Sammy!
That is the answer!

19:13.854 --> 19:15.287
Listen, listen.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.476
Anthony is a Tortelli man, right?

19:17.728 --> 19:19.559
Now, all Tortelli men are scum.

19:19.811 --> 19:23.167
Ergo, given time,
his eye will wander,

19:23.477 --> 19:26.514
and the rest of his slimy body
will follow.

19:26.852 --> 19:29.047
Come on, Mrs Tortelli,
we haven't got all day.

19:29.310 --> 19:32.063
I have to clean my room
before dinner.

19:34.684 --> 19:37.039
I just don't see what your hurry is.

19:37.308 --> 19:40.266
I mean, why don't you two have
a little engagement period, huh?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.352
I'll tell you what,
I'll make a deal with you.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.396
Give me two weeks.

19:45.349 --> 19:46.418
What do you mean?

19:46.724 --> 19:48.077
You two stay totally apart.

19:48.307 --> 19:50.184
Don't see each other,
don't talk to each other,

19:50.431 --> 19:52.387
don't send messages
for two weeks.

19:52.639 --> 19:55.631
Then, at that time,
if you still want to get married,

19:55.931 --> 19:57.159
I'll give you my blessing.

19:57.514 --> 20:00.347
- That's all we have to do?
- That's all?

20:00.680 --> 20:01.715
I'll die.

20:01.930 --> 20:05.400
Our burning love
will keep you alive, Anthony.

20:06.221 --> 20:07.415
I don't know.

20:07.845 --> 20:09.403
What's the matter, Anthony?
You afraid?

20:09.637 --> 20:11.753
Listen, if you don't think your
love is strong enough--

20:12.095 --> 20:14.768
Oh, no, no. We ain't afraid of nothing.
Okay, you got it.

20:15.094 --> 20:17.688
But we come back here
in two weeks

20:17.969 --> 20:19.482
and we're even more sure.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.074
And after that we'll be together,
forever and ever.

20:22.343 --> 20:24.573
You mean like through eternity?

20:24.843 --> 20:27.403
No, like through the weekend, momar.

20:28.259 --> 20:30.819
I'm gonna be heartsick missing you.

20:38.966 --> 20:42.276
That is the most childish, unsanitary
thing I've ever seen in my life.

20:42.590 --> 20:47.539
Boy, I'll say. Don't they realize that
gum is a breeding ground for cooties?

20:58.088 --> 21:00.443
Anthony, would you get
away from the window?

21:00.712 --> 21:03.784
You're fogging up the glass
with your lovesick breath.

21:04.087 --> 21:05.759
Don't be such a grump, Ma.

21:06.003 --> 21:08.073
I warned you my feelings
wouldn't change.

21:08.336 --> 21:10.896
Not in two weeks,
not in two years.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.080
You blew it.

21:14.127 --> 21:15.526
I'm dead meat, Sam.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.868
I thought you had this
figured out, logically.

21:18.126 --> 21:19.957
Yeah, well, he never went out
of the damn house.

21:20.210 --> 21:22.440
How's he supposed to have his head
turned by another woman

21:22.709 --> 21:24.222
if he never saw one?

21:24.459 --> 21:26.768
He just locked himself in a room,
and he never came out

21:27.042 --> 21:29.795
except for hot meals
and cold showers.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.195
So you gonna sign the consent?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.449
What else can I do?

21:34.707 --> 21:36.743
They kept their end of the bargain.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.804
- Anthony!
- Annie!

21:44.956 --> 21:46.389
Sinuses, Carla.

21:47.247 --> 21:51.240
Well, Mrs Tortelli,
it's been two weeks.

21:51.580 --> 21:54.140
I think it's still clear that Anthony and l
are very much in love

21:54.413 --> 21:55.971
and wanna get married.
Right, Anthony?

21:56.204 --> 21:58.877
That's right.
Here's the form, Ma.

21:59.162 --> 22:01.312
You said you would sign it.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.363
You're too damn young, Anthony.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.133
Please, this is the worst mistake
anybody could make.

22:12.410 --> 22:14.128
Believe me, I made it.

22:14.368 --> 22:15.926
You gave your word.

22:16.909 --> 22:19.264
Yeah, I did, didn't l?

22:20.159 --> 22:22.992
Hey, hurry it up, Annie.
I'm double-parked.

22:23.325 --> 22:25.680
We'll be right there.
Won't this be great, Anthony?

22:25.950 --> 22:28.145
You and me together for all time.

22:28.408 --> 22:30.444
Yeah, that's great. Who is that?

22:31.782 --> 22:35.058
Oh, that's my cousin, Gabrielle.
Gabrielle, my fiancé.

22:35.365 --> 22:37.959
Will you hurry it up and sign?
We haven't got all day.

22:38.281 --> 22:40.476
Hey, Gabrielle, it's nice to meet you.

22:40.781 --> 22:43.454
Nice to meet you.
You're even cuter than Annie said.

22:47.071 --> 22:48.424
How come I haven't
met you before?

22:48.946 --> 22:50.698
I've been at cheerleading school.

22:51.946 --> 22:54.506
Hey, when are we having
your cousin over for dinner?

22:54.779 --> 22:57.896
Let's say we get married first.
Then we'll discuss the dinner guests.

22:58.195 --> 22:59.423
Yeah, well, my word is my word.

22:59.653 --> 23:01.371
I guess I'd better be signing
this document

23:01.611 --> 23:03.488
so you two can be alone
together forever.

23:03.736 --> 23:05.055
What's your hurry, Ma?

23:05.277 --> 23:07.393
Why don't you buds
have a root beer?

23:07.652 --> 23:09.802
I'm gonna help Gabrielle
find a parking space.

23:10.068 --> 23:11.899
- I'm worried about her.
- Anthony!

23:12.151 --> 23:14.301
Hey, just get off my back.
This will take two minutes.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.046
Nag, nag, nag.

23:17.942 --> 23:20.820
Gabrielle, you ever have
a hot fudge sundae for breakfast?

23:27.482 --> 23:30.440
- They're not coming back, are they?
- Nope.

23:30.898 --> 23:34.493
Gee, and I got 50 boy cousins
who can drive.

23:37.564 --> 23:39.077
It was bound to happen.

23:39.772 --> 23:41.444
Pretty smart, Mrs Tortelli.

23:42.396 --> 23:45.149
Let me fill you in
on something, Annie.

23:46.396 --> 23:50.025
There are three things
that you can say about Tortelli men:

23:50.354 --> 23:53.824
One, they draw women like flies.

23:54.145 --> 23:57.057
Two, they treat women like flies.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.258
Three, their brains are in their flies.

24:05.976 --> 24:07.614
Yeah, one more thing:

24:07.851 --> 24:09.807
They throw away
the best women.

24:10.892 --> 24:13.281
You know, for a loser,
you're not bad.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.397
Ditto, Mrs T.
