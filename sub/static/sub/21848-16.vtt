My neighbor Kenny and his
girlfriend go all the time.

00:06.974 --> 00:09.110
The rides were actually fun,
Claire,

00:09.177 --> 00:11.412
even though they hurl you
through the air very quickly

00:11.479 --> 00:13.914
without a proper
three-point seat belt.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.384
It was worth
the $300 I spent.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.086
What kind of carnival
will cost you that
much money?

00:18.152 --> 00:20.388
It was not
just the carnival.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.391
Kenny's girlfriend wanted to
go to see a movie afterwards,

00:23.457 --> 00:25.393
but I just got
the second edition

00:25.459 --> 00:27.528
of Chaikof's
Atlas of Vascular Therapy

00:27.595 --> 00:29.063
so decided not to go.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.164
And you paid
for everyone?

00:30.231 --> 00:31.532
I had to.
I lost the bet.

00:31.599 --> 00:34.235
Rounds will have to wait.
We have a consult come up.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.703
Hunter Denoble, 38.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.072
Came into the E.R.
this morning complaining
of severe neck pain.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.007
X-rays
show anterolisthesis.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.243
A herniated disc.
Thirty-eight a little young
for that, isn't it?

00:42.310 --> 00:44.812
Unless there's a history
of spinal trauma.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.114
There is.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.316
Hunter fractured
seven vertebrae
in his neck and back

00:48.382 --> 00:50.151
in a motorcycle accident
10 years ago.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.752
He was one of
my first patients.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.355
Suffered complete paralysis
from the chest down.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.957
...a few months back,
just gnawing pain.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.992
Ibuprofen usually
took the edge off.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.594
Every day?

01:00.661 --> 01:03.497
Uh, yeah, give or take.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.100
It's not that bad.
Last night
things changed.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.268
He couldn't move
his neck at all,

01:07.335 --> 01:09.337
and the pain medicine
had no effect.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.373
So, he wanted to tough it out,
but I dragged him in here.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.674
Yeah, it sounds like you.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.942
(HUNTER CHUCKLES)
Feel that?

01:15.008 --> 01:16.009
Yeah.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.311
And that?
Mmm-hmm.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.113
I made partner
at the firm.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.249
I don't like
to call in sick.

01:21.315 --> 01:25.153
And let's face it, I've spent
enough nights in hospital
rooms for five lifetimes.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.355
Can't argue with that.
Squeeze my hands.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.393
You have any tingling
or weakness in your arms?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.961
No.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.797
The plain films showed
what looked like
a herniated disc.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.400
Which would mean...?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.202
Artificial
disc replacement.

01:41.269 --> 01:45.105
Day procedure, he'd be out
by the morning at the latest.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.175
You married him?

01:49.643 --> 01:52.480
Yes, three years ago
in Cancun.
It was lovely.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.149
Even though
he's in a wheelchair?

01:55.216 --> 01:56.417
Shaun.
HUNTER: Oh, no worries.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.486
I get this all the time.

Since I don't
want to see you,

03:14.161 --> 03:16.464
it follows that I don't want
to hear from you, either.

is definitely infected.

this one and clean the area

03:40.954 --> 03:41.989
before
the bacteria spreads.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.791
Well,
can you replace it?

is resolved

03:45.526 --> 03:47.027
and you have
a few months to heal.

I don't want to walk
around with half
of a face for a few months.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.999
Isn't there anything
you can do
to save the implant?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.934
I can't make
any guarantees,

03:54.001 --> 03:56.570
but if I can replace
the implant without
risking re-infection, I will.

a laptop for school

04:42.983 --> 04:45.152

that isn't severed,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.232
it can start to
function again.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.869
So, this mass
is causing Hunter's pain?

06:41.935 --> 06:43.170
Yes.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.271
If the cord is healthy,

06:44.337 --> 06:46.273
why aren't I feeling
more than pain?

06:46.339 --> 06:48.041
The mass is compressing
the healthy cord,

06:48.108 --> 06:49.477
just letting the pain
through.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.178
We still have to do

06:51.244 --> 06:53.981
some more advanced imaging
to map the mass,

06:54.047 --> 06:55.616

06:55.683 --> 06:57.250
that if we removed it
that could change.

You may be able
to walk again.

Dr. Andrews needs
to have a look at this.

minimal blood loss.

usually a week at most.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.946

I just might not be able
to make them?

10:13.013 --> 10:14.882

it's low risk.

10:26.193 --> 10:30.063
What I see here
is a chance to fix a problem.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.899
And I see a chance
to create a new one.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.574
Look, I see a lot of men
with this issue.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.711
Sure, they come in
because they want kids,

10:43.777 --> 10:46.413
but I think what
they really want is
to reaffirm themselves.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.148
And that's a good thing.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.484
Thank you.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.991
It's a spinal
arachnoid meningioma.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.860
Have you seen
one of these before?

10:59.927 --> 11:01.094
DR. MELENDEZ: Much smaller.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.730
They usually
don't get this big

11:02.796 --> 11:06.199
because the pain and weakness
brings the patient
into the E.R. fast.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.868
But in this case,
no pain,

11:07.935 --> 11:09.903
no E.R. visit
until it got this big.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.372
And it's wrapped around
the spinal cord tightly
and fused with the dura.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.908
Can we get a fiber-optic laser
and take it out in segments?

11:15.909 --> 11:18.611
No, I don't think so.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.482
It stopped growing
and settled in this position.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.853
But I do think
that we can dissect along
the subarachnoid plane

11:25.919 --> 11:27.554
down to the largest
segment at T2

11:27.620 --> 11:28.789
and remove it
in one piece.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.958
That's an extension
of the mass.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.794
Mmm, no.
It's the medullary pyramids.

11:33.861 --> 11:37.430
No.
It's an extension of the mass.

11:37.497 --> 11:41.668
The pyramids are more central
and the color is wrong.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.304
Murphy's right.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.207
The extension's
tightly adhered
to the brainstem.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.483

under the skin.

underlying tissue as well.

You removed the bad
part from her face,

12:18.839 --> 12:21.441
and it's fixed.
Looks good,
no more infection.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.076
Let's just do the same
with the rest of 'em.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.644
It's not that simple.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.814
When we removed the infection
from Emma's cheek,

12:26.880 --> 12:29.783
it was under the pretense
it was a localized issue.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.285
If we just take out
the infection from
the new area,

12:32.352 --> 12:33.553
it could jump again.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.825
I won't do it.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.360
When an infection spreads,
it often moves very quickly.

is saying...

When I went
to drop my daughter
off at Michigan,

we went to that bar
on Liberty Street,

12:55.108 --> 12:56.810

You lose touch
with who you were.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.772
You... You said it was
an infection, right?

13:25.839 --> 13:27.607
Like strep throat
or something.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.878
That's what
antibiotics are for.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.379
Couldn't we just
use that?

13:35.015 --> 13:39.086
We could try strong,
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

13:39.152 --> 13:41.221
but I really don't
want to do that.

the pain?

It wasn't when Dr. Melendez
told me after the accident.

climbing a tree,

22:46.365 --> 22:48.267

what really mattered,

37:01.119 --> 37:02.388
it was too late.

37:07.158 --> 37:10.128
I don't want us
to be like them.

37:10.195 --> 37:13.231
I want to be
fully committed to you.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.168
I love you, too.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.872
(CHUCKLES)

37:25.744 --> 37:28.847
There's a surgery I could have
that should make me fertile,

37:28.914 --> 37:30.716
but there's a risk
of impotency.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.722
What do you want to do?

37:36.788 --> 37:38.089
I want to give you
what you want,

37:38.156 --> 37:39.425
what we want,
a family.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.861
We are a family.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.131
Yes, I want children,

37:46.197 --> 37:48.300
and there are many ways
to do that,

37:48.367 --> 37:51.002
which we'll explore
together.

37:51.069 --> 37:54.072
But I draw the line
at anything
that risks our sex life.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.743
**

38:05.116 --> 38:06.685
It's just
one night a week,

38:06.752 --> 38:09.555
but I think this could be
my big break, you know?

38:09.621 --> 38:10.956
Well, you always had
a beautiful voice.

38:12.123 --> 38:15.026
Well, everyone's
got one thing, right?

38:15.093 --> 38:17.429
But enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.465
Do you have a man?

38:20.231 --> 38:22.167
I did.

38:22.233 --> 38:26.004
Pretty young thing
should have plenty of choices.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.939
Hmm, I'm not looking to
complicate my life right now.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.008
Hmm.

38:30.075 --> 38:33.745
Still looking after
everyone else but yourself,

38:33.812 --> 38:35.547
like you did for me.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.586
* Set your dreams
where nobody hides

38:40.652 --> 38:43.021
You know,
I know brag to everyone.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.890
"My baby.
She's a surgeon."

38:44.956 --> 38:46.692
Surgical resident.

38:46.758 --> 38:47.826
Right, sorry.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.396
You like it?

38:52.864 --> 38:54.766
I love it.

38:54.833 --> 38:58.169
* Give your tears to the tide

38:58.236 --> 39:00.506
Where are you staying?
You're...
Are you in town for a while?

39:00.572 --> 39:02.508
Yeah.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.109
I'd like
to be closer to you.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.446
**

39:08.614 --> 39:10.616
I found a place.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.585
You'd like it,

39:13.652 --> 39:17.188
but I just need to put up
first and last.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.425
* No time

39:20.626 --> 39:21.893
I'll pay you back.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.963
**

39:27.165 --> 39:28.567
How much do you need?

39:28.634 --> 39:30.536
$2,500.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.539
Plus I have to get furniture
and, you know, all of that.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.373
I thought maybe you could
help me pick that stuff out.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.675
You've always been
so good at that.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.444
I really appreciate it.
I'm good for it.

39:39.344 --> 39:41.713

40:06.371 --> 40:09.841
* Set your dreams
where nobody hides

40:09.908 --> 40:12.711
KENNY:
Uh, Celeste isn't coming.
She broke up with me.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.146
I hate her.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.517
But I'm not gonna let that
ruin our night.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.885
That's what friends are for.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.488
They got each other's backs,
rain or shine.

40:22.554 --> 40:25.757
By the by, I found a $20
in your battery drawer,

40:25.824 --> 40:27.425
so I got us
Chinese food.

40:27.493 --> 40:30.496
Don't thank me.
I don't like Chinese food.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.830
Aw, come on now.

40:31.897 --> 40:34.600
Trust me, everybody likes
Ma Jong's Kung Pao.

40:34.666 --> 40:38.970
* Set your dreams
where nobody hides

40:39.037 --> 40:40.872
There you go.

40:40.939 --> 40:44.042
I'm pretty torn up
about that Celeste thing.
She was a real keeper.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.011
You said
you hated Celeste.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.713
I do.
I... I hate her 'cause...

40:47.779 --> 40:49.715
I don't know...
I kind of love her.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.484
This tastes terrible.

40:52.551 --> 40:55.253
Okay,
then he hates Chinese food.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.022
More for me.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.323
Plain white rice?

40:59.725 --> 41:01.793
* No time

41:01.860 --> 41:03.495
Oh, uh,
I got a gaming console,

41:03.562 --> 41:05.396
and I hooked it up to
your bad boy over there.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.865
We can play some
Mortal Kombat.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.067
**

41:09.134 --> 41:10.235
Come on.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.906
* No time *

41:14.973 --> 41:17.008
We doing this or what?

41:18.276 --> 41:19.711
It sounds fun.

41:21.613 --> 41:24.716
**

41:24.783 --> 41:26.284
Yeah, there you go.

41:26.351 --> 41:27.719
This one's you.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.357
That's you on the left
right there.

41:32.423 --> 41:34.225
Okay.
Yeah.

41:34.292 --> 41:37.929
You got four arms,
but you're naked,
so here we go.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.365
SHAUN: I gave you
a pneumothorax.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.300
KENNY: Ah, I didn't
realize how bloody
this game was.

41:42.367 --> 41:43.902
Ooh, a fireball.
I got you there.

41:45.103 --> 41:46.437
Have you played
this before?

41:46.504 --> 41:49.741
SHAUN: That looks like
a spinal fracture.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.877
KENNY: Yeah, I'd say...
I'd say there's
a huge fracture there.

41:51.943 --> 41:53.144
SHAUN: You died.

41:56.682 --> 41:59.685
