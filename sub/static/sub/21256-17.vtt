Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.621 --> 00:02.921
<i>All of you asked me out,</i>

00:02.951 --> 00:04.428
<i>I don't see why I can't date all of you.</i>

00:04.452 --> 00:05.971
- I'm cool with that.
- Yeah, I'm down.

00:06.855 --> 00:08.288
I went on a date with someone.

00:08.323 --> 00:11.391
CALLIE: <i>Um, I don't think I'm ready</i>

00:11.426 --> 00:13.526
for us to get back together.

00:13.561 --> 00:15.105
And since when is this your internship?

00:15.129 --> 00:16.962
Because I'm the one
who told you about it.

00:16.998 --> 00:19.109
It's not fair for you to tell
me I can't apply to something

00:19.133 --> 00:20.366
just because you are.

00:20.402 --> 00:21.402
I'd be wearing a wire.

00:21.436 --> 00:22.769
STEF: <i>And I would be close by.</i>

00:22.804 --> 00:24.771
<i>I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.</i>

00:24.806 --> 00:26.950
If you come around here
again, I'm gonna call the cops.

00:26.974 --> 00:28.908
<i>Maybe I'll even call Gray himself.</i>

00:28.943 --> 00:30.742
- How you doin'?
- (SIGH) I'm good.

00:30.778 --> 00:32.244
It feels good to be back.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.513
CALLIE: <i>ICE has already
detained her parents,</i>

00:34.548 --> 00:37.149
Thessalina said that
I could live with them.

00:37.184 --> 00:38.595
JUDE: <i>Everyone loves
the show the way it is,</i>

00:38.619 --> 00:40.685
so... better not screw it up, right?

00:40.721 --> 00:42.021
<i>No, I didn't get in,</i>

00:42.056 --> 00:43.488
<i>but I haven't told anyone yet.</i>

00:43.524 --> 00:45.524
Maybe art isn't your true calling.

00:48.762 --> 00:52.697
How does she know if
art is my true calling?

00:52.733 --> 00:57.268
I think she just didn't wanna
tell me that I'm not good enough.

00:58.271 --> 00:59.838
I don't believe that.

00:59.873 --> 01:04.108
You should still appeal. Show 'em
you won't take no for an answer.

01:04.144 --> 01:06.610
Seriously. People get in that way.

01:06.646 --> 01:08.313
You can't give up.

01:09.515 --> 01:12.616
You okay? Anything happen?

01:12.652 --> 01:16.454
They moved my mom and dad
back here to San Diego.

01:16.489 --> 01:18.256
What... That's great.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.023
Their hearing is Friday.

01:20.059 --> 01:22.092
Friday?

01:22.127 --> 01:25.028
Uh... Why are you letting me
go on about my stupid problems?

01:25.064 --> 01:27.331
That's not stupid. And I just found out.

01:27.366 --> 01:29.567
Okay, so what does your lawyer think?

01:29.602 --> 01:31.936
He thinks all we can do is argue

01:31.971 --> 01:33.403
that they've been here a long time,

01:33.439 --> 01:35.573
and have been model citizens.

01:35.608 --> 01:37.174
And try to get a cancellation

01:37.209 --> 01:39.142
until they can hopefully
get a green card.

01:39.178 --> 01:41.144
So what can we do to help?

01:41.180 --> 01:45.648
Tony thought maybe we could
put together a short video,

01:45.684 --> 01:48.385
you know, using the footage of
when my parents were being taken

01:48.420 --> 01:50.520
by ICE, and what happened with me.

01:50.555 --> 01:53.590
That might help the judge see
what they'd be doing to our family,

01:53.625 --> 01:56.425
if they deport our
parents. If you have time.

01:56.461 --> 01:57.461
Of course.

- Hey, Ximena.

Hi.

02:07.238 --> 02:08.270
I'm late for class.

02:08.306 --> 02:09.949
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Um, do you have a second?

02:09.973 --> 02:13.209
- Yeah.
- I wanted to ask both of you, um...

02:13.244 --> 02:16.045
the law school is sponsoring
this panel about the impact

02:16.080 --> 02:19.448
social media has on politics. (SIGHS)

02:19.484 --> 02:22.385
We already had someone drop
out, and I thought of you guys.

02:22.420 --> 02:23.620
Would you be willing to do it?

02:23.654 --> 02:25.488
It's tomorrow morning.

02:25.523 --> 02:27.222
- Sure.
- Yeah.

02:27.257 --> 02:29.558
Great. I'll email you the info.

02:29.593 --> 02:30.833
Okay, well... see you tomorrow.

02:30.861 --> 02:31.861
See ya.

02:39.102 --> 02:42.103
So, uh... I haven't heard from you

02:42.139 --> 02:45.640
- since um...
- Yeah, um... sorry.

02:45.675 --> 02:48.543
Just, been really busy with everything.

02:49.846 --> 02:52.780
I just wanna, you know... make sure...

02:54.284 --> 02:55.383
are we still friends?

02:56.719 --> 02:58.386
Of course.

02:58.422 --> 02:59.422
Okay.

03:02.358 --> 03:07.461
I think I was... just surprised...

03:07.496 --> 03:09.764
you were seeing someone so soon.

03:09.799 --> 03:14.769
I mean, it's fine...
because we talked about it...

03:14.804 --> 03:18.439
and you were honest with
me, which... I appreciated.

03:20.509 --> 03:22.876
I... I just...

03:22.911 --> 03:24.311
I still wanna hang out, you know?

03:25.514 --> 03:26.613

tell you about this panel.

03:41.563 --> 03:43.463
Yeah.

03:43.498 --> 03:49.302
Um... Amanda, that's the
girl I've kinda been seeing,

03:49.337 --> 03:52.572
she's... well, she'll be there.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.008
'Cause she's on the
committee that organized it.

03:56.043 --> 03:57.810
So she's a law student?

03:57.845 --> 03:59.512
- Yeah.
- Cool.

03:59.547 --> 04:02.081
So I just wanted to
give you a heads up...

04:02.117 --> 04:05.350
you know, uh, just in
case, if it's an issue...

04:05.385 --> 04:07.019
It's not. It's fine.

04:07.054 --> 04:08.186
Okay.

Hey.

Remember that guy, James Sterns,
we brought in a few months ago

04:57.570 --> 04:59.069
for distributing child pornography?

04:59.104 --> 05:01.539
- Yeah.
- He gave up a few more names.

05:01.574 --> 05:03.818
Can you write the warrants to
search their homes and computers?

05:03.842 --> 05:05.409
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

05:11.383 --> 05:13.583
Hey. Are you looking for me?

05:13.618 --> 05:15.418
Sorry I just show up unannounced.

05:15.453 --> 05:17.654
No, that's fine. Is everything okay?

05:20.292 --> 05:23.226
Kyle says he sees suspicious
cars outside the house.

05:23.261 --> 05:25.461
And that he gets unknown
callers on his cell phone,

05:25.497 --> 05:28.631
and when he answers, he can
hear someone is on the line,

05:28.667 --> 05:29.932
but they don't speak.

05:29.967 --> 05:32.368
Um, wh... when did this start happening?

05:32.404 --> 05:35.605
Shortly after he wore the wire.

05:35.640 --> 05:39.676
And tried to get that child
molester to talk to him.

05:39.711 --> 05:40.976
- Patrick Molloy.
- Yes.

05:41.012 --> 05:44.113
- Okay.
- And Kyle thinks that maybe that detective...

05:45.316 --> 05:48.417
Gray is trying to intimidate him.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.124
Oh, Mariana, hey, I, uh, got your email,

05:55.159 --> 05:57.492
and I'd be happy to write
you a letter of recommendation

05:57.528 --> 05:58.772
for the Bandt Foundation internship.

05:58.796 --> 06:01.062
- Mm.
- Great. Thanks.

Emma is also applying?

06:03.934 --> 06:07.703

06:07.738 --> 06:08.837
that we're both doing it?

06:08.872 --> 06:10.272
I mean, maybe we'll both get in?

06:10.307 --> 06:11.873
Absolutely. No, I'm glad to have

06:11.908 --> 06:13.186
more students from Anchor Beach apply.

06:13.210 --> 06:15.043

what you're building?

06:17.114 --> 06:18.554

Oh, um...

06:20.817 --> 06:23.051
I'm still exploring a
couple of different options.

06:23.086 --> 06:25.086
Well, you need to decide right away.

06:28.959 --> 06:33.027
Um... got it. I will... decide tonight.

06:33.063 --> 06:35.296
Just let me know. Thanks.

06:35.331 --> 06:37.498
- Shit.
- What?

06:37.533 --> 06:38.999
I have no idea what I'm doing.

06:39.034 --> 06:40.154
Haven't thought of anything.

06:41.271 --> 06:42.803
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:42.838 --> 06:45.239
So do you have any dietary restrictions?

06:45.275 --> 06:49.577
Uh... no, I mean, I'm
a pescatarian, why?

06:49.612 --> 06:50.756
I'm cooking dinner for you tonight.

06:50.780 --> 06:54.047
Farm to table. Do you like truffle oil?

06:54.083 --> 06:56.583
- Um...
- What's truffle oil?

06:56.618 --> 06:59.753
It's a oil... and
it's made from truffle.

06:59.789 --> 07:02.689
- About tonight...
- Gluten and dairy? Can you do that?

07:02.724 --> 07:04.291
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

07:04.326 --> 07:05.558
Sorry. What about tonight?

07:06.861 --> 07:07.927
What time?

07:09.598 --> 07:12.766
Then you'll add a roundhouse kick
into a cyclone combo.

07:16.237 --> 07:18.004
that's how to maximize your power-up.

07:18.039 --> 07:20.006
That's a good one.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.240
All right, guys, we got time

07:21.276 --> 07:22.742
for just one more question.

07:22.778 --> 07:24.944
Uhh... it's for Jude.

07:24.979 --> 07:27.980
Ahamilton14 wants to know,
"What's with your hair,

07:33.988 --> 07:37.223
Um... yeah, I've kinda been
wondering the same thing.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.831
Gotta go.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.499
Are you harassing Kyle Snow?

07:48.736 --> 07:50.636
From what I've heard, Mr. Snow's the one

07:50.671 --> 07:51.948
that's been doing the harassing,

07:51.972 --> 07:53.104
of Patrick Molloy.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.217
I find that very interesting

07:54.241 --> 07:56.208
that you're still in
contact with a pedophile

07:56.243 --> 07:57.742
you say hasn't committed a crime.

07:57.777 --> 07:58.988
Are we really doin' this again?

07:59.012 --> 08:01.713
It's almost as if you dropped
the charges against Molloy

08:01.748 --> 08:04.549
so that he wouldn't testify
as Kyle's alibi witness.

08:04.584 --> 08:05.884
You're afraid if he talks,

08:05.919 --> 08:07.030
he's gonna end your career, Gray?

08:07.054 --> 08:09.955
I think we both know who's
career's at stake here.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.423
Somebody's a liar.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.859
If you've got something,
why haven't you used it?

08:14.894 --> 08:16.627
Maybe I will.

08:28.873 --> 08:31.130
So what is the Golden Door?

08:31.403 --> 08:33.470
It's a fancy spa.

08:33.506 --> 08:36.373

a couple days of pampering.

08:36.408 --> 08:37.642

Are you gonna miss me?

Of course.

08:45.351 --> 08:48.619
Uhh, I don't know.
I'll... think of somethin'.

that I'm getting better,

09:00.832 --> 09:03.900
to apply for other colleges, so...

09:03.935 --> 09:05.568
So what are you gonna
do in the meantime?

09:05.603 --> 09:06.870
We got our gig.

09:06.905 --> 09:09.372
Okay. Yeah, that's one thing, what else?

that I'm not doing anything?

going back to school and work,

thing I learned from being sick

09:35.132 --> 09:36.498
is that time is precious,

09:36.533 --> 09:41.937
and... sure, you can spend a year
waiting to reapply to colleges,

09:41.972 --> 09:44.807

12:12.284 --> 12:15.085
So... how long have you lived here?

12:15.120 --> 12:18.822

I lived in my car for a while.

12:18.858 --> 12:22.392
I couch surfed for a while. I
lived with Daphne for a while.

12:22.427 --> 12:26.563
And then, you know, worked after
school until I could get this place.

12:27.867 --> 12:29.532

12:36.475 --> 12:39.809
Doesn't she... worry about
you living on your own?

12:41.346 --> 12:43.946
I've pretty much been on
my own since my dad died.

12:45.517 --> 12:47.484

16:30.153 --> 16:32.153
And I have a question for Callie.

16:32.188 --> 16:35.789
What from your own experience
compelled you to be so committed

16:35.824 --> 16:37.257

16:39.461 --> 16:43.430
Well, she's my friend... and mentor.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.866
And just a really incredible person.

16:47.936 --> 16:50.069
And it's just the right thing to do.

16:50.105 --> 16:54.307
But if you're asking how
I can relate personally...

16:55.743 --> 16:59.545
my brother and I were in
the foster care system.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.482
Sometimes we'd be taken out of a
house in the middle of the night,

17:03.518 --> 17:07.553
no explanation, no say in our fate.

17:07.588 --> 17:10.823
So I guess I understand,

17:10.858 --> 17:14.727
uh, what it's like to feel powerless.

17:14.762 --> 17:18.631
When our rights are taken, or when
someone isn't treated with dignity,

17:18.665 --> 17:20.733
I believe that it affects all of us,

17:20.768 --> 17:24.002
and it's our responsibility
to do something about it.

17:48.928 --> 17:51.374

that he would, uh, talk to me

17:51.398 --> 17:52.575
about a project I'm working on?

17:52.599 --> 17:53.898
I can ask him.

17:53.933 --> 17:56.467

thing. I don't have much time.

19:24.755 --> 19:26.455
My question is for Ximena.

19:26.490 --> 19:28.468
Your parents knew that they
were committing a criminal act

19:28.492 --> 19:30.291
when they entered
this country illegally.

19:30.327 --> 19:33.094
Why do you think they
deserve special consideration?

19:33.129 --> 19:36.597
I don't. I just think they
should be treated fairly.

19:36.632 --> 19:39.633
Besides wanting a better
life for me and my sister,

19:39.669 --> 19:41.702
they were encouraged
to come to this country

19:41.737 --> 19:43.537
because of a demand for cheap labor,

19:43.573 --> 19:46.841
like many other immigrants, and
now they're being punished for it?

19:46.876 --> 19:51.712
We didn't have an immigration
detention system until the 1980s.

19:51.747 --> 19:55.282
And... they're not considered
criminals, by the way.

19:55.317 --> 19:59.052
Like most detained immigrants,
they're being held in civil custody,

19:59.088 --> 20:01.555
but they're being
treated much, much worse

20:01.591 --> 20:03.290
than actual criminals.

20:03.325 --> 20:07.361
And you know, people have been
locked up for as long as 10 years,

20:07.396 --> 20:10.663
abused, living in abysmal conditions.

20:10.699 --> 20:14.201
And then, when they're deported,
there's almost no consideration

20:14.236 --> 20:17.704
of their welfare in the country
that they're being sent back to.

20:17.739 --> 20:21.741
And they almost never think
about how it impacts the family.

20:21.776 --> 20:26.112
It's... punitive and
inhumane, to say the least.

20:26.147 --> 20:28.815
The Supreme Court ruled that
deportation is not a punishment,

20:28.850 --> 20:30.696
it's simply returning an illegal alien

20:30.697 --> 20:31.996
to the place where
they rightfully belong.

20:32.020 --> 20:35.655
Okay, well, that ruling is
over a hundred years old,

20:35.690 --> 20:38.958
and by the way, it also
protected a law that required

20:38.994 --> 20:42.361
at least one white witness to
testify on behalf of an immigrant

20:42.397 --> 20:44.630
in order to get a
certificate of residence.

20:44.665 --> 20:47.500
So, sounds pretty racist to me, no?

20:47.535 --> 20:49.935

33:04.806 --> 33:05.905
Sends me back to prison?

33:05.941 --> 33:07.674
He can't just do that.

33:07.709 --> 33:08.875
He did it before.

33:08.910 --> 33:10.254
I mean, they... they
can cut people deals,

33:10.278 --> 33:11.811
get them to say whatever they want.

33:14.115 --> 33:16.883
Your mom says that you also have
noticed people watching the house?

33:16.918 --> 33:20.686
- Is that true?
- I'm not... I'm not paranoid.

33:20.721 --> 33:22.421
I don't think you are, Kyle.

33:25.326 --> 33:26.892
Let me show you something.

33:33.801 --> 33:36.935
I didn't show this to my mom 'cause...

33:36.971 --> 33:38.604
I don't wanna scare her.

33:47.981 --> 33:49.981
I found that on the porch this morning.

33:50.016 --> 33:53.217
You think it just...
crawled up and died there?

34:00.659 --> 34:03.127
I talked to Declan... and he's out.

34:03.162 --> 34:05.762
So Eminent Power's dropping us.

34:05.797 --> 34:07.464
Thanks a lot.

34:16.141 --> 34:19.208
(TYPING)

35:02.319 --> 35:04.464
Hey, I need to get these, uh,
requests for search warrants

35:04.488 --> 35:05.954
over to Judge Walderman, please?

35:05.989 --> 35:07.021
Thanks.

XIMENA: <i>You know, my dad
always said that Poppy and I</i>

<i>What makes you an American
and me an American,</i>

35:24.340 --> 35:26.407

<i>These are Americans.</i>

35:53.402 --> 35:56.400
Your Honor... as you just saw,

35:56.401 --> 35:59.900
Juan and Maria Theresa
Sinfuego are good people.

35:59.905 --> 36:03.934
They have jobs, they pay
their taxes, they go to church.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.478
They give back to their community.

36:05.514 --> 36:08.515
Their two daughters, one of
whom is an American citizen,

36:08.550 --> 36:11.817
are both exemplary students.

36:11.853 --> 36:15.888
Juan and Maria Theresa aren't
depleting our resources.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.658
They and their children
are adding to them.

36:18.693 --> 36:21.327
Deporting these good and
loving parents will do nothing

36:21.363 --> 36:24.631
to keep our country safer, and
it'll devastate their daughters

36:24.666 --> 36:27.499
Ximena and Poppy, as well
as the dozens of people

36:27.535 --> 36:30.395
whose lives they've
touched in the 18 years

36:30.396 --> 36:33.005
they have called America home.

36:33.041 --> 36:36.575
I am begging you, Your Honor,
keep this family together.

36:46.446 --> 36:48.013
(SIGH)

36:53.854 --> 36:55.319
So you had fun?

36:56.423 --> 36:58.289
Uh, not as fun as this.

37:00.760 --> 37:04.995
Yes, um... it was very nice
mother-and-daughter bonding time.

37:05.031 --> 37:08.732
- Mm.
- So what did you do while I was gone?

37:10.070 --> 37:12.636
Uhh, not much, really.

37:12.672 --> 37:14.939
Except I, uh, think I figured out

37:14.974 --> 37:16.239
what I wanna do with my life.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.275
Heh...

37:18.644 --> 37:20.044
Oh?

37:20.079 --> 37:22.680
Yeah, uh, you know,
there's... there's this school

37:22.715 --> 37:26.283
that has a, uh, a really
great program for film scoring.

37:26.318 --> 37:28.251
I think I wanna apply.

37:28.287 --> 37:29.752
You think?

37:29.788 --> 37:31.821
It's in L.A.

37:35.094 --> 37:36.993
Well, I think you should go for it.

37:37.028 --> 37:40.397
I know you said you don't
want me wasting my time.

37:40.432 --> 37:42.466
Well, I don't wanna waste
my time with you, either.

37:44.570 --> 37:47.403
Well, L.A. isn't that far.

37:47.438 --> 37:50.907
And... and what I meant
was, yes, time is precious,

37:50.942 --> 37:53.910
but... we have plenty of it.

37:56.214 --> 37:57.513

I know it's a year from now, but, um...

38:14.565 --> 38:16.365
hopefully, you don't have plans.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.501
I think I'm available.

38:18.536 --> 38:20.335
Me, too.

JUDGE: It's clear Mr. and Mrs.
Sinfuego are honorable people

38:27.745 --> 38:30.345
who have lived positive
and productive lives here.

38:30.380 --> 38:32.959
Their daughters are a testament to
that, and the court does not wish

38:32.983 --> 38:35.316
to see them unduly suffer.

38:35.352 --> 38:39.687
For that reason, I order that
they be released from detention...

38:39.722 --> 38:42.300
on a $7,500 bond,

38:42.601 --> 38:46.000
and given a stay of 30 days
to get their lives in order,

38:46.463 --> 38:49.164
and to arrange for care of Penelope.

38:49.199 --> 38:51.999
After which, they are to report
to Immigration and Customs

38:52.035 --> 38:54.301
for immediate deportation.
