- Brewster, you son of a fish town whore.

01:07.109 --> 01:10.110
I'm sure you've harpooned
more than one tainted target.

01:10.145 --> 01:12.946
Now, now, Robby. Don't speak
of your mother like that.

01:12.981 --> 01:15.415
- It's poor manners.
- (knife clinks)

01:20.522 --> 01:23.423
So, what's your haul?

01:23.458 --> 01:25.558
(Sighs) The mother lode.

01:25.594 --> 01:27.738
Twenty brace of ham hocks.

01:29.831 --> 01:31.998
- A man could retire on that.
- Aye.

01:33.502 --> 01:35.702
It's a shame you have to
come all this way for mine.

01:35.737 --> 01:36.970
I'll double your fee if you tell me

01:37.005 --> 01:38.304
who you work with on the Tory side.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.141
Ah, not a chance, Rob. Not a chance.

01:41.176 --> 01:43.754
You want a piece of the London
trade, you go through me.

01:44.780 --> 01:48.882
I tell you, Caleb, London trade
ain't what it used to be.

01:48.917 --> 01:51.017
Privateer's raiding loads on both sides,

01:51.053 --> 01:55.121
others moving on to kidnapping...
or so I hear.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.258
Like there ain't no honor
among thieves anymore. Hmm?

01:58.293 --> 02:00.560
(Chuckles)

02:00.595 --> 02:01.795
Do you mind if I sample the wares?

02:05.600 --> 02:07.133

Look at him.

04:05.249 --> 04:06.315
That man's ass is so tight,

04:06.350 --> 04:08.315
he must shit through his teeth.

04:09.987 --> 04:11.787
Put a bridle on that mouth,

- or I'll do it for you.
- Oh, yeah, you and what army?

04:15.092 --> 04:16.947
Sure as hell ain't this one.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.461
Teddy: <i>I swear, I thought
they were taking me out</i>

04:19.497 --> 04:21.329
to shoot me, not trade me.

04:21.365 --> 04:24.733
All this time, I told myself I was
doing my part, tending my fields,

04:24.769 --> 04:26.101
but keeping an eye out for any gleanings

04:26.137 --> 04:27.369
I thought might help.

04:27.405 --> 04:29.571
Mr. Beddows was an agent of Robert Howe,

04:29.607 --> 04:31.740
another unfortunate casualty
of Arnold's defection.

04:31.776 --> 04:34.338
Did General Arnold interrogate
you personally?

04:34.373 --> 04:37.479
-<i> No, sir.</i> I suppose he thought me
a little fish,

04:37.515 --> 04:39.381
only good for reeling in a bigger one.

04:42.686 --> 04:44.353
I want to enlist, sir.

04:44.388 --> 04:46.288
Fight like a soldier like I
should have from the beginning.

04:46.323 --> 04:48.791
Colonel Hampton will see
to your enlistment.

04:48.826 --> 04:52.094
- Thank you, sir.
- (mouths) Thank you.

04:57.802 --> 05:00.335
What was Brewster doing in Connecticut?

05:00.371 --> 05:02.805
Likely selling goods
on the London trade.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.741
It's good cover for his trips
across the sand on Culper business.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.410
How did Arnold know?

05:09.313 --> 05:10.512
Well, he doesn't, sir.

05:10.548 --> 05:12.181
He knows that Caleb is my friend,

05:12.216 --> 05:13.348
that he's seconded to my command,

05:13.384 --> 05:14.817
and he knows that I run spies,

05:14.852 --> 05:17.453
but he knows nothing about
Culper senior or junior.

05:17.488 --> 05:18.620
Brewster does.

05:19.924 --> 05:21.924
He would never give up the ring, sir.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.625
He has already destroyed it.

05:24.929 --> 05:26.728
I want a full report
on all remaining assets

05:26.764 --> 05:28.497
on my desk by tomorrow morning.

05:28.532 --> 05:29.731
<i>(Men arguing)</i>

05:29.767 --> 05:31.200
<i>- Okay?
- Yeah?</i>

05:31.235 --> 05:33.535
Bugger off.

05:41.745 --> 05:43.479
Soldier: <i>He says we shouldn't
be saluting you, sir,</i>

05:43.514 --> 05:45.013
<i>on account of not being paid.</i>

05:45.049 --> 05:48.016
It's true that
we haven't been paid, sir.

05:48.052 --> 05:50.052
Your quarrel over disrespect to me,

05:50.087 --> 05:54.963
but in doing so, you disrespect
yourselves and this army!

06:07.004 --> 06:08.504
Mrs. Barnes: Don't complain, Hess,

06:08.539 --> 06:10.339
at least they're not
eating their buttons.

06:10.374 --> 06:12.508
How hard can it be to get food,

06:12.543 --> 06:15.010
or clothes, or proper uniforms?

06:15.045 --> 06:17.579
My Jeb's been using his socks for gloves

06:17.615 --> 06:19.821
Oh, wait a moment.

06:24.955 --> 06:27.356
I bet you could use this
for a warm pair of gloves,

06:27.391 --> 06:28.690
with a bit of needlecraft.

06:28.726 --> 06:30.959
And I have the needle and the craft.

06:30.995 --> 06:32.094
Have you got enough beaver pelts

06:32.129 --> 06:33.095
for the rest of his company?

06:33.130 --> 06:34.730
Shh.

06:34.765 --> 06:37.366
<i>Lady Washington.</i>

06:44.808 --> 06:46.775
Clever, isn't it?

06:48.479 --> 06:50.679
That awful winter at Valley Forge,

06:50.714 --> 06:52.614
my husband made do with just a spoon.

06:52.650 --> 06:56.585
But with this, he would have
had a full set of cutlery.

06:56.620 --> 06:59.154
Why don't you take it?

06:59.190 --> 07:01.757
I'm sure the woman who
made it would be honored.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.625
A woman?

07:03.661 --> 07:04.860
Of course.

07:06.864 --> 07:09.698
It'll have to be a trade. Here.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.800
Perhaps this will keep
someone else warm.

07:11.835 --> 07:15.571
These winter days are so dark and short,

07:15.606 --> 07:17.272
but this little fellow

07:17.308 --> 07:19.975
is like an early bloom
poking through the snow.

07:20.010 --> 07:22.300
It warms me somehow.

07:23.447 --> 07:26.215
- Mrs. Strong, isn't it?
- That's right.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.050
I have been meaning to compliment you

07:28.085 --> 07:29.117
on your own ingenuity.

07:29.153 --> 07:30.652
What, mine?

07:30.688 --> 07:32.654
Turning this old cart
into a trading post

07:32.690 --> 07:34.556
when money is tight.

07:34.592 --> 07:36.592
And it's a meeting ground

07:36.627 --> 07:38.594
between the two worlds of this camp.

07:38.629 --> 07:42.564
- The two worlds?
- Men and women.

07:47.371 --> 07:50.305
Isn't she kind to grace us
with her company?

07:50.341 --> 07:52.174
Before she goes back up
to her plantation

07:52.209 --> 07:53.976
to be tended by all her servants.

07:54.011 --> 07:56.311
Mrs. Washington strikes me as
a woman with a good heart.

07:56.347 --> 07:59.459
- Oh, of course you'd like her.
- Carney, laundry.

07:59.495 --> 08:00.582
You do it.

08:00.618 --> 08:02.117
I'm through washing clothes
for officers,

08:02.152 --> 08:04.987
when men like my husband
can barely keep warm.

08:06.991 --> 08:08.590
This is Captain Williams' coat.

08:08.626 --> 08:10.459
I'm not in your army,
so I don't take your orders,

08:10.494 --> 08:11.860
you gotch-gutted bugger.

08:11.895 --> 08:14.963
- I'll do it, corporal.
- She'll do it.

08:16.500 --> 08:20.035
Maybe you could ask Lady
Washington to do the load.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.170
I ain't touching a rag.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.395
I say, Mr. Mulligan,
for a supposed loyalist,

08:46.430 --> 08:49.431
you have a rather checkered history.

08:49.466 --> 08:51.166
<i>It seems you're a founding member</i>

08:51.201 --> 08:52.668
<i>of the Sons of Liberty.</i>

08:52.703 --> 08:54.670
Not a founding member, no.

08:55.572 --> 08:57.005
As a member, then,

08:57.041 --> 08:59.841
you participated in
the Battle of Golden Hill.

08:59.877 --> 09:02.477
More a scuffle than a battle, I'd say.

09:02.513 --> 09:05.380
- You admit to your crimes?
- My follies.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.416
Youthful indiscretions
on behalf of a cause

09:07.451 --> 09:10.686
that time and maturity
have shown to be false.

09:10.721 --> 09:12.988
And so you'd have your customers believe

09:13.023 --> 09:16.692
while you gall them
into betraying confidences

09:16.727 --> 09:18.427
that you can then pass on
to your friends

09:18.462 --> 09:19.795
on the rebel side.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.196
I assure you,

09:21.231 --> 09:23.865
the only confidences
shared by my customers

09:23.901 --> 09:26.034
are their waist sizes, and on which side

09:26.070 --> 09:28.537
they prefer to dress,
if you take my meaning.

09:30.774 --> 09:33.175
As for my loyalty,

09:34.311 --> 09:35.711
I've taken my oaths,

09:35.746 --> 09:37.779
and it's never been questioned.

09:37.815 --> 09:39.881
Certainly not by my father-in-law,

09:39.917 --> 09:42.315
Admiral Sanders, of the Royal Navy.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.554
And you think you can
hide your sins behind him?

09:46.423 --> 09:48.196
My sins are of the past.

09:48.926 --> 09:51.282
I'd hoped you at least be sympathetic,

09:51.762 --> 09:52.828
given your own.

09:52.863 --> 09:54.830
<i>(Door opens)</i>

09:54.865 --> 09:58.433
Ah, general.

09:58.469 --> 10:02.037
Jesus, the red really does suit ya.

10:04.942 --> 10:07.809
<i>(Men chattering)</i>

10:22.526 --> 10:26.025
- Man: <i> Ten and six, correct?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.097
Though I should be paying you,

10:29.133 --> 10:31.781
for being so sweet to me.

10:34.905 --> 10:35.937
I suggest you reserve

10:35.973 --> 10:38.240
your tongue for other purposes.

10:43.213 --> 10:45.981
(Clears throat) Colonel, sir?

10:46.016 --> 10:48.173
<i>You wanna hear this.</i>

10:52.623 --> 10:55.957
Arnold caught another spy.
This one you know.

10:55.993 --> 10:57.724
It's Caleb Brewster.

11:08.607 --> 11:10.574
Aberdeen?

11:12.545 --> 11:14.512
I brought the "Gazette."

11:16.749 --> 11:19.316
- It's all right, he won't be seen.
- Ma'am.

11:19.352 --> 11:20.985
What is he doing here?

11:21.020 --> 11:22.720
He's come to tell us
that Brewster's been captured

11:22.755 --> 11:23.888
and to gather our belongings.

11:23.923 --> 11:25.856
Now, I... I didn't say that.

11:25.892 --> 11:28.092
- Then why have you come?
- I came here to ask your help,

11:28.127 --> 11:30.944
- to smuggle me into the city.
- Abe: What?

11:31.218 --> 11:32.651
If you can arrange business
with Colonel Cooke

11:32.686 --> 11:34.620
we can build a false bottom
into your wagon.

11:34.655 --> 11:36.889
- Oh, God.
- Abe: Ben, Ben, it's not going to work.

11:36.924 --> 11:39.458
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I said
to Brewster when he used the Turtle

11:39.493 --> 11:41.360
to sail into New York
Harbor and rescue you.

11:41.395 --> 11:43.195
The Turtle, what Turtle?
What does he mean?

11:43.230 --> 11:45.197
- Aye, it's an...
- It's sort of a...

11:45.232 --> 11:46.665
- What?
- It's a submersible.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.101
It's a boat that goes under the water.

11:48.136 --> 11:52.271
- It's all right, it's destroyed now.
- We should just go now.

11:52.306 --> 11:54.473
It's not getting in that's the
problem, it's getting out.

11:54.508 --> 11:57.509
If Brewster refuses to admit to
spying, they can't hang him.

11:57.545 --> 11:59.445
So, what, he rots in a cell
until the end of the war?

11:59.480 --> 12:02.514
- If he even lives that long.
- Abe: No.

12:05.230 --> 12:06.793
No, we trade him.

12:07.866 --> 12:09.499
Trade him? Trade him for what?

12:09.535 --> 12:10.967
Their pirates took one of ours.

12:11.003 --> 12:12.803
You have ours, take one of theirs.

12:14.273 --> 12:16.139
An upstanding Tory,

12:16.175 --> 12:18.408
loyal son of Setauket?

12:20.379 --> 12:21.933
Think about it.

12:22.448 --> 12:25.348
- No, I am. Well, it's not bad.
- It's not bad.

12:25.384 --> 12:27.217
Kidnapping you is not bad?

12:27.252 --> 12:28.685
If we pull it off, we get Brewster back

12:28.720 --> 12:30.153
and we strengthen Abe's cover as well.

12:33.625 --> 12:36.927
I know you hold yourself
in high regard, Abraham,

12:36.962 --> 12:39.029
but you're just not important enough.

12:40.132 --> 12:42.199
Now, the Magistrate of Setauket,

12:42.234 --> 12:44.668
that's a ransom that will not be
questioned, and a ransom that

12:44.703 --> 12:47.771
Cooke will pay even if
the price is a rebel smuggler.

12:47.806 --> 12:49.539
- He does have a point.
- Abe: Well, then the rebels

12:49.575 --> 12:50.874
will be offering two for one.

12:52.911 --> 12:54.411
I'm not letting you do this alone.

12:54.446 --> 12:56.880
Mary: <i>So, you're both fools?</i>

12:58.617 --> 13:01.485
Mary, it's just a play.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.752
But it's one that we get to write.

13:02.788 --> 13:06.356
And I will see it through, personally.

13:09.461 --> 13:11.561
(All chattering)

13:21.373 --> 13:23.673
Excuse me, do you know
where Mrs. Carney lives?

13:23.709 --> 13:25.475
- Over there.
- Thank you.

13:33.285 --> 13:36.132
- <i>(Baby crying)</i>
- Mrs. Carney?

13:37.882 --> 13:39.548
Hester?

13:47.399 --> 13:49.833
- (Grunting)
- Got an eyeful yet?

13:55.040 --> 13:56.506
- Hesther: <i>Get out.</i>
- Man: <i> All right.</i>

13:56.542 --> 13:58.141
<i>- Get off.
- All right, all right.</i>

13:58.177 --> 14:00.510
(mumbles)

14:00.546 --> 14:03.480
- I want to apologize.
- I can guess why you're here.

14:03.515 --> 14:05.448
Good luck swaying that woman.

14:05.484 --> 14:08.285
Ten years of marriage has
taught me the folly of trying.

14:14.059 --> 14:16.560
Mrs. Carney, I... I'm sorry
for the intrusion,

14:16.595 --> 14:20.030
but I heard your baby crying and...

14:20.065 --> 14:21.865
And you're the helpful type, I know.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.467
Sorry, I don't have no tea to offer you.

14:24.503 --> 14:25.902
A little different out here
than cuddling

14:25.938 --> 14:28.104
with your darling major, ain't it?

14:30.269 --> 14:33.009
I understand your anger.

14:33.045 --> 14:35.579
But I've also heard of another woman who

14:35.614 --> 14:38.446
refused to work and was drummed out.

14:38.481 --> 14:40.539
And now I see you have a child.

14:40.574 --> 14:42.381
- So?
- So...

14:44.050 --> 14:46.017
for all it's problems,

14:46.052 --> 14:51.689
this camp is a safer place for
a family than what's outside.

14:54.093 --> 14:57.061
So, yes, I'd like to help,

14:57.096 --> 15:00.264
with laundry or anything else
they ask you to do.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.367
What about your settler's cart?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.203
I'll ask someone else to mind it.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.508
(Whines)

15:10.543 --> 15:12.009
You don't much like me, do ya?

15:13.212 --> 15:15.413
Well, I certainly ain't no fine lady.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.783
But I ain't no officer's moll, neither.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.218
I know what ain't fair
and what ain't right,

15:21.254 --> 15:23.187
I won't lay down for those bastards.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.489
No matter how they plan to harm me.

15:35.787 --> 15:38.488
- Caleb Brewster.
- Yes, I have him.

15:38.523 --> 15:39.756
What's your interest in the man?

15:39.791 --> 15:41.324
He interrogated me after my capture,

15:41.360 --> 15:43.620
and was quite brutal about it.

15:43.656 --> 15:45.862
I'd like to repay him in kind.

15:47.666 --> 15:48.698
That's all very well and good,

15:48.734 --> 15:50.867
but he has information that I need.

15:50.902 --> 15:52.469
He's part of a ring of rebel spies.

15:52.504 --> 15:54.471
I'm very familiar with them.

15:54.506 --> 15:56.578
Major André assigned me to
track them down.

15:56.603 --> 15:57.574
He did?

15:57.609 --> 15:59.642
I identified their leader,
Robert Rogers.

15:59.678 --> 16:03.179
Would have killed him except
for a spot of bad luck.

16:03.215 --> 16:04.572
Rogers?

16:05.150 --> 16:07.825
Well, I suppose the man was
always a bit of a mercenary.

16:08.320 --> 16:12.188
Still, I need Brewster
to name the others.

16:12.224 --> 16:14.958
May I ask how you plan
to achieve that, sir?

16:14.993 --> 16:17.260
I'll show him mercy if he names names,

16:17.295 --> 16:18.371
the rope if he doesn't.

16:18.406 --> 16:19.747
Trust me,

16:19.783 --> 16:22.065
I've seen the man, he's
no credit to soldiering.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.500
He'll be quaking in his boots.

16:25.650 --> 16:28.551
Do you mind if I sit in
and observe your methods?

16:29.641 --> 16:31.174
Given your history with him,

16:31.209 --> 16:33.743
I think it better
you sit outside, don't you?

16:33.779 --> 16:35.478
Of course. Thank you.

16:41.753 --> 16:44.087
<i>(Footsteps approaching)</i>

16:47.125 --> 16:49.058
Leave us.

16:52.097 --> 16:53.196
Hiya, general.

16:54.099 --> 16:55.790
How's your day going?

17:00.639 --> 17:03.273
(Sighs)

17:08.413 --> 17:10.146
You know, I don't know
if you're the fellow

17:10.182 --> 17:12.890
to be taking this up with,
but the food here is terrible.

17:13.718 --> 17:16.886
Do you find your situation here
amusing, Lieutenant Brewster?

17:16.922 --> 17:19.222
Well, if I'd spouted off
to you back in camp

17:19.257 --> 17:21.257
I'd be thrown in jail,

17:21.292 --> 17:24.828
but seeing as you've turned
coats, and I'm already in chains,

17:24.863 --> 17:26.996
I can finally speak me mind,

17:27.031 --> 17:33.036
and tell ya, you are a two-faced,
pompous, piece of shite.

17:34.158 --> 17:38.194
So, yeah, I do find it a touch amusing.

17:45.584 --> 17:46.850
I know you're the whale boatman

17:46.885 --> 17:48.751
named in Mr. Sackett's papers.

17:48.787 --> 17:52.922
The courier for Benjamin
Tallmadge and his Culper ring.

17:52.958 --> 17:55.492
And I know that if you don't give
up the names of your confederates,

17:55.527 --> 17:57.602
then you'll be hanged.

18:03.001 --> 18:04.968
(Sighs)

18:05.003 --> 18:06.569
Right.

18:08.526 --> 18:10.225
What's in it for me?

18:12.711 --> 18:14.577
Well, if you cooperate,
I'll spare your life.

18:15.367 --> 18:16.966
That's it?

18:16.991 --> 18:19.658
I get to live in this
shithole or some other?

18:19.784 --> 18:22.085
<i>(laughing)</i>

18:22.120 --> 18:25.088
No, I don't think I'll be
confessing for spying for that.

18:25.123 --> 18:28.358
And if I don't confess,
you can't hang me,

18:28.393 --> 18:31.758
<i>so you're not really offering
me anything, are you?</i>

18:31.783 --> 18:33.716
What did you have in mind?

18:33.741 --> 18:36.375
Well, let's see, how much did
you get for jumping ship?

18:36.668 --> 18:38.442
The whole $10,000
I heard you were after?

18:38.467 --> 18:40.901
Or did the lobsters short ya?

18:42.007 --> 18:44.274
(laughing)

18:44.309 --> 18:47.210
They did, didn't they?
The slimy bastards.

18:48.947 --> 18:51.014
You see, that's why I always insist

18:51.049 --> 18:53.783
on money in hand before
I hand over me goods.

18:53.818 --> 18:55.118
Oh, so you admit to smuggling?

18:55.153 --> 18:56.486
Well, nowhere near your level.

18:56.521 --> 18:58.254
<i>I read your record of court-martial,</i>

18:58.290 --> 19:00.005
<i>your business dealings
in Philadelphia were quite...</i>

19:00.040 --> 19:02.725
I was... I was cleared of all charges.

19:02.761 --> 19:04.994
Yeah? That's not what I heard.

19:05.030 --> 19:07.564
- <i>And it's not what they say.</i>
- And what do they say?

19:07.599 --> 19:10.600
About you? What, in camp?

19:10.635 --> 19:14.571
They say that if you were ever to be
captured, they'd cut off your leg,

19:14.606 --> 19:16.573
<i>the one that was wounded in Saratoga,</i>

19:16.608 --> 19:18.975
<i>and they'd bury it with honors.</i>

19:19.010 --> 19:21.344
But the rest of you, they'd just hang.

19:21.379 --> 19:22.712
You dirty little runt!

19:22.747 --> 19:24.280
Well, at least they ain't a Judas,

19:24.316 --> 19:27.884
who sold out his whole country
for a pile of silver!

19:29.654 --> 19:31.445
He's all yours.

19:43.034 --> 19:45.168
(laughing stops)

19:47.706 --> 19:50.340
- My turn.
- (grunts)

20:00.159 --> 20:03.194
As though I was looking through a
spyglass and I all I could see

20:03.230 --> 20:04.729
was the two of them.

20:05.832 --> 20:09.000
It took an hour and a dram of brandy,

20:09.035 --> 20:11.202
before I could fully
regain my composure.

20:11.238 --> 20:13.705
Well, you were upset.
And with good reason.

20:13.740 --> 20:17.375
- I was upset with myself.
- Why?

20:17.410 --> 20:19.510
Because I was the one who urged Congress

20:19.546 --> 20:21.179
to declare bankruptcy last year.

20:21.214 --> 20:22.981
Well, you did not sign up
to be a politician

20:23.016 --> 20:24.915
as well as a general.

20:25.852 --> 20:27.685
But still...

20:27.721 --> 20:31.389
can't you allow yourself
even a moment of relief?

20:31.424 --> 20:36.394
Ah, that damned candle.
I told Billy to change it.

20:36.429 --> 20:38.763
Well, I imagine candles
are in short supply.

20:38.798 --> 20:41.132
Spanish fly as well.

20:41.167 --> 20:46.137
I've kept this army together,
believing the key was to endure.

20:46.172 --> 20:50.041
Force the British to stay in
the field, sap their finances,

20:50.076 --> 20:51.984
but now...

20:52.712 --> 20:55.154
we're the ones who are being sapped.

20:55.782 --> 20:58.116
Without funds to continue the fight,

20:58.151 --> 21:02.320
or some improbable victory
to conclusively decide it,

21:02.355 --> 21:03.621
this war is lost.

21:03.657 --> 21:05.657
You're doing all you can.

21:05.692 --> 21:07.917
It's not enough.

21:11.364 --> 21:15.199
Well, it certainly makes the
problems in Mt. Vernon seem trivial.

21:16.069 --> 21:17.335
What problems?

21:17.370 --> 21:20.012
Oh. Nothing.

21:20.607 --> 21:25.376
The carpenter questioned the wood for
the paneling in the servant's hall.

21:25.412 --> 21:26.811
We said oak, didn't we?

21:26.846 --> 21:29.847
Yes, he thought that pine
would be adequate.

21:29.883 --> 21:33.818
Nonsense! Oak isn't just
a material, it's a theme.

21:33.853 --> 21:36.120
I mean, clearly the man has no notion

21:36.156 --> 21:39.123
of the value of consistency and harmony.

21:39.159 --> 21:44.696
You know, I had a very nice
talk with Mrs. Strong.

21:44.731 --> 21:47.265
She runs that little trading post.

21:47.300 --> 21:50.234
She's providing a good service.

21:50.270 --> 21:53.137
Letting the camp women
barter for necessities.

21:53.173 --> 21:57.008
I don't like the idea of camp
followers mixing with the soldiers.

21:57.043 --> 22:02.580
Mm, I know, you prefer orderly
lines, ever the surveyor.

22:03.950 --> 22:07.719
Still, I think you'll appreciate this.

22:11.791 --> 22:13.658
One of the camp women made it.

22:15.495 --> 22:17.729
- Well, that's crude, but clever. - Mm.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.900
Maybe because we're so often
on the outside of things,

22:22.936 --> 22:25.636
we're usedo finding
clever solutions to problems.

22:25.672 --> 22:27.438
What are you talking about?

22:28.608 --> 22:30.608
Well, if your direct petitions
to Congress

22:30.643 --> 22:32.744
are falling on deaf ears,

22:32.779 --> 22:35.346
perhaps I could speak with their wives.

22:36.549 --> 22:40.718
Martha Jefferson,
for example, Esther Reed?

22:40.754 --> 22:42.954
We could organize the women
throughout the colonies

22:42.989 --> 22:44.889
and raise money for the Army.

22:45.792 --> 22:47.792
I could publish a letter,

22:47.827 --> 22:50.644
"The Sentiments of an American Woman."

22:51.831 --> 22:53.131
What do you think?

22:55.368 --> 22:57.568
As long as it's not
in the "Royal Gazette."

22:57.604 --> 22:59.437
(chuckles)

23:00.673 --> 23:02.781
You know I leave tomorrow.

23:09.182 --> 23:11.215
(Water splashing)

23:25.432 --> 23:27.498
- Simcoe: Back with us again?
- (groans)

23:28.601 --> 23:29.901
I was afraid you'd drifted off,

23:29.936 --> 23:31.736
and so early in the evening.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.673
- What did I miss?
<i>- Just the preliminaries.</i>

23:35.708 --> 23:38.242
I wanted to get the small
talk out of the way

23:38.278 --> 23:41.012
before we began a real conversation.

23:41.047 --> 23:44.916
Just to be clear, this isn't about
payback, it's about respect.

23:44.951 --> 23:49.120
That's funny. I got none for you.

23:49.155 --> 23:51.089
Well, I think you were showing
me a warrior's respect

23:51.124 --> 23:53.758
by your eagerness to inflict pain.

23:53.793 --> 23:55.860
To think anything less would break me

23:55.895 --> 23:57.095
would have been an insult.

23:57.130 --> 23:59.597
Now I extend you the same courtesy.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.533
You expect me to thank you for that?

24:02.569 --> 24:04.969
When one's soul recognizes
its counterpart,

24:05.004 --> 24:06.437
even in an enemy,

24:06.473 --> 24:09.173
there's already a measure of gratitude.

24:09.431 --> 24:13.411
Untie me here, and I'll
show you how grateful I am.

24:13.446 --> 24:16.614
See? As beasts we make a promise

24:16.649 --> 24:19.650
that one will stand and one will fall.

24:20.025 --> 24:23.187
But between us, that promise
has gone unfulfilled thus far.

24:23.223 --> 24:26.958
And we both know that you would
have killed me at Meeg's Harbor

24:26.993 --> 24:29.093
had Tallmadge not intervened,

24:29.129 --> 24:32.913
or killed me in captivity if
General Scott hadn't interrupted.

24:33.831 --> 24:36.968
Or the ambush at Rocky Point,
if you'd been a better warrior.

24:37.003 --> 24:38.836
Oh, yeah. (chuckles)

24:38.872 --> 24:40.771
No, that ambush answered
a question for me,

24:40.807 --> 24:43.107
because even though
you had the advantage,

24:43.143 --> 24:46.911
I still bested you, and
your master, Robert Rogers.

24:48.414 --> 24:51.682
Or should I call him Samuel Culper?

24:52.552 --> 24:54.652
(Chuckles)

24:58.725 --> 24:59.991
What did you say?

25:01.394 --> 25:03.327
Oh, I didn't say shite.

25:05.465 --> 25:06.597
No.

25:07.467 --> 25:09.167
That laugh...

25:09.202 --> 25:11.402
was the first honest thing you've said.

25:11.437 --> 25:13.171
And with it, you were
telling me I was wrong,

25:13.206 --> 25:17.875
but did you mean I was wrong
about besting you...

25:17.911 --> 25:20.511
or wrong about Rogers?

25:22.782 --> 25:25.917
Did you honestly
wake me up for this shite?

25:25.952 --> 25:30.855
If Rogers isn't Culper, then who?

25:35.295 --> 25:36.427
Woodhull.

25:38.198 --> 25:40.698
It was Woodhull all along.

25:40.733 --> 25:44.235
(laughing)

25:44.270 --> 25:46.153
Abe Woodhull?

25:47.740 --> 25:49.740
What, you mean, the cabbage farmer?

25:49.776 --> 25:51.842
Yes, the nuisance.

25:51.878 --> 25:54.212
The weakling. The victim.

25:54.247 --> 25:56.247
The farmer with the root cellar,

25:56.282 --> 25:58.783
that convinced me it was
being used by Robert Rogers.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.851
But what's easier to believe?

26:00.887 --> 26:04.989
A veteran savage like Rogers taking
orders from the likes of Major Tallmadge

26:05.024 --> 26:07.024
or four friends
from the same little town?

26:07.894 --> 26:09.193
Oh, yeah.

26:09.229 --> 26:12.263
Tallmadge, the leader. You, the courier.

26:12.298 --> 26:14.298
Woodhull is Culper.

26:14.334 --> 26:17.235
And that just leaves the man
in New York, Culper junior.

26:18.271 --> 26:19.971
Who the hell is Culper?

26:21.808 --> 26:24.041
Colonel Cooke, Judge
Woodhull's corrupt patron,

26:24.077 --> 26:27.211
protected his son before,
and no doubt will do so again.

26:27.247 --> 26:29.747
So, a full confession will be required.

26:29.782 --> 26:31.682
I'll take dictation.

26:31.718 --> 26:34.719
(laughs) Never gonna happen.

26:40.326 --> 26:44.795
I encourage you to reconsider.

26:56.342 --> 26:58.576
Challenge accepted.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.981
(All chattering)

27:09.336 --> 27:11.803
Good morning, Mrs. Barnes.

27:11.838 --> 27:14.306
How much can you spare
in the way of provisions?

27:15.509 --> 27:18.209
I have some turnips and potatoes.

27:18.245 --> 27:20.879
Good, we're taking up a collection.

27:20.914 --> 27:24.616
- What for?
- Haven't you heard?

27:24.651 --> 27:27.619
The order came down today
signed by Washington himself.

27:27.654 --> 27:29.754
Hester is to be drummed out.

27:30.991 --> 27:33.358
Washington's making an example of her.

27:33.393 --> 27:35.961
Warning the men to keep
their wives in line.

27:35.996 --> 27:38.129
They're ordered to be present.

27:39.166 --> 27:40.498
It just doesn't sound like him.

27:41.868 --> 27:44.369
Well, maybe you don't know him

27:44.404 --> 27:46.171
as well as she does.

27:54.514 --> 27:56.281
I hope you'll reconsider.

27:56.316 --> 27:58.350
You're the only one
who can keep him in good humor.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.385
The war has taken a toll on him,

28:00.420 --> 28:02.354
but I can't stay,
nor would he want me to.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.222
Anna: <i>Mrs. Washington.</i>

28:05.692 --> 28:09.427
- Can you spare a moment?
- Of course, Mrs. Strong.

28:09.463 --> 28:11.630
One of the camp women
is being drummed out,

28:11.665 --> 28:13.365
for refusing to do laundry.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.533
And she's stubborn, but she has a child,

28:15.569 --> 28:17.769
and I'm sure I can bring her around.

28:17.804 --> 28:19.838
If you could just ask the general
to give her a little more time.

28:19.873 --> 28:21.673
He never wanted the camp
followers here to begin with.

28:21.708 --> 28:23.708
We all must do what we can
without forgetting

28:23.744 --> 28:24.976
that we also have the army

28:25.012 --> 28:26.411
and the general who commands it.

28:33.820 --> 28:35.353
Ben: <i>This isn't your problem, Anna,</i>

28:35.389 --> 28:37.088
and, frankly,
we've got much bigger ones.

28:37.124 --> 28:38.690
It's not a possibility
that a mother and a child

28:38.725 --> 28:40.625
might be put out
is of no concern to you?

28:40.661 --> 28:42.727
And we both know, the real problem
is, there's no pay for the men.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.195
We all have to remember
why we joined this fight.

28:44.231 --> 28:45.630
Maybe it's harder for women to remember

28:45.666 --> 28:48.033
when they see injustice closer to home.

28:48.068 --> 28:50.769
Sir, Havens is here to see you.

28:50.804 --> 28:52.837
- Havens? Walter Havens?
- Anna.

28:52.873 --> 28:55.206
- Havens, it is you.
- What are you...

28:55.242 --> 28:57.175
It's a long story.

28:57.210 --> 28:58.576
I was very sorry to hear about Caleb.

28:59.479 --> 29:01.012
I came as quick as I could.

29:01.048 --> 29:03.581
- What happened to Caleb?
- He was grabbed.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.817
- It's all right, we're taking care of.
- Why didn't you tell me?

29:05.852 --> 29:08.687
I need you to round up some of the lads
who made it over here from Setauket.

29:08.722 --> 29:11.523
We're gonna go back and kidnap a
couple of those rich, Tory bastards

29:11.558 --> 29:13.258
and trade them for Brewster.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.394
Kidnap them? I don't know, Ben.

29:16.430 --> 29:19.297
Judge Woodhull and his son.

29:20.701 --> 29:22.400
I've been itching for a shot at them two

29:22.436 --> 29:24.536
- ever since I got out of there.
- I know.

29:24.571 --> 29:27.806
But remember, if we're going to
trade them, they can't be harmed.

29:27.841 --> 29:29.274
Now, I'll be going along,
but no one can know

29:29.309 --> 29:31.009
that the army is involved.

29:31.044 --> 29:33.511
- All right?
- I'll round up friends, get us a boat.

29:33.547 --> 29:34.946
Good, I'll catch up with you.

29:34.981 --> 29:38.249
Anna, you'll have
to tell me that story later.

29:41.088 --> 29:43.822
I had no time to look for you,
I had to get to Abe,

29:43.857 --> 29:46.991
- and the trade was his idea.
- That's not good enough.

29:48.595 --> 29:50.295
You should ask for a ransom as well,

29:50.330 --> 29:52.464
since you'll be trading two for one.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.943
And you don't want to say Caleb's
worth as much as the Magistrate.

29:56.303 --> 29:57.779
That's a good idea.

29:58.238 --> 30:00.407
Suppose I could start off those.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.516
<i>- (Wet thud)</i>
<i>- </i> (Caleb groaning)

30:17.124 --> 30:18.656
Why not let yourself scream?

30:20.127 --> 30:23.528
A beast has no shame
in howling if it's wounded.

30:23.563 --> 30:28.032
Or, you could just make it stop by
confessing to what I already know,

30:28.068 --> 30:29.434
and sign the paper.

30:35.342 --> 30:37.642
(Groaning)

30:39.412 --> 30:40.712
(laughing)

30:46.486 --> 30:48.720
I'm impressed.

30:48.755 --> 30:51.416
Most men would have
begged for mercy by now.

30:52.259 --> 30:55.360
The only one who'll be
begging for mercy is you.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.228
You and all the redcoats.

30:57.264 --> 31:02.567
Begging and wishing you never left home.

31:02.602 --> 31:03.568
Home?

31:03.603 --> 31:07.238
(Cackling) Home.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.408
(Sighs)

31:13.680 --> 31:15.313
<i>You know, I realize,</i>

31:15.348 --> 31:18.610
that we've been at this
all night and all morning,

31:19.052 --> 31:21.697
and I've been no more
forthcoming than you.

31:25.158 --> 31:27.994
It might surprise you to know...

31:28.695 --> 31:30.628
that I wasn't born in England.

31:30.664 --> 31:33.041
Never actually set foot on her.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.269
This is the part where you say,

31:38.305 --> 31:40.071
"So, where were you born, John?"

31:40.106 --> 31:41.739
If only to give yourself
a little breather.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.175
(Heavy breathing)

31:44.211 --> 31:46.511
You're asking with your eyes,
I can tell.

31:46.546 --> 31:48.807
So, here's the answer.

31:50.050 --> 31:51.649
I was born in India.

31:51.685 --> 31:54.485
My father was a surgeon at Fort William.

31:54.521 --> 31:58.189
And I grew up watching him minister
to the poor mongrels of Bengal.

31:58.225 --> 32:01.426
Only at age 10, to see them turn on him,

32:01.461 --> 32:05.430
and throw him in a tiny cell
designed to hold three men,

32:05.465 --> 32:07.899
they put him in with 60.

32:10.036 --> 32:12.437
"Black Hole of Calcutta,"
they called it.

32:15.675 --> 32:17.675
Now, here was a man,

32:17.711 --> 32:20.745
whose job it was to dispense mercy,

32:22.983 --> 32:26.251
killed by the merciless
he sought to save.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.355
Well, at least he didn't
have to see you grow up.

32:30.390 --> 32:31.456
That was a mercy.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.258
(Groaning)

32:39.165 --> 32:45.003
Mercy is weakness. Strength is truth.

32:46.806 --> 32:48.539
Those are the lessons of Calcutta.

32:48.575 --> 32:51.776
Lessons I've been teaching
to colonists ever since

32:51.811 --> 32:53.444
as a member of the Royal Army,

32:53.480 --> 32:55.665
in Guyana or the Caribbean.

32:56.783 --> 32:59.083
And now here in New York with you.

33:03.390 --> 33:08.660
So, you see, Caleb, I am home.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.680
You keep yapping...

33:11.231 --> 33:13.725
and I may scream.

33:16.069 --> 33:19.137
(laughing)

33:19.172 --> 33:21.239
Each man is driven by something.

33:21.274 --> 33:26.044
Now I remember... watching your uncle

33:26.079 --> 33:29.047
shake with palsy at the trial.

33:32.385 --> 33:33.551
Remember?

33:35.755 --> 33:37.288
(Chuckles)

33:39.793 --> 33:41.893
That sort of thing runs in
the family, doesn't it?

33:47.600 --> 33:50.095
You know, I may hate weakness,

33:51.671 --> 33:52.837
but you fear it.

33:54.174 --> 33:56.708
You've been running from it
all your life.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.409
(Giggling)

33:58.445 --> 34:03.181
Now, you know who I am.

34:03.216 --> 34:05.049
And I know who you are.

34:05.085 --> 34:08.686
All I know is I'm looking at a dead man.

34:08.722 --> 34:10.855
If you think your friends
will come for you, they won't.

34:10.889 --> 34:12.489
Oh, it don't matter.

34:12.525 --> 34:14.625
I know they'll kill you,

34:14.661 --> 34:16.594
and that's as good as me doing it.

34:21.201 --> 34:23.295
I learned other things in India,

34:23.737 --> 34:26.237
things I'm eager to share with you.

34:31.478 --> 34:32.610
Today...

34:32.645 --> 34:34.112
<i>(sword clangs)</i>

34:34.147 --> 34:36.714
...tonight...

34:36.750 --> 34:38.516
or even tomorrow, if it comes to that.

34:40.320 --> 34:41.719
I'm in no hurry.

34:41.755 --> 34:43.621
(Screaming)

34:51.264 --> 34:53.074
You see?

34:53.485 --> 34:55.453
There's no shame.

35:02.830 --> 35:05.930
- What are you doing?
- In case they don't feed us.

35:05.964 --> 35:08.331
Father, they can't know that we
know we're going to be kidnapped.

35:09.534 --> 35:11.067
They won't be holding us long.

35:11.102 --> 35:12.702
Ben's already sent
the ransom note to Cooke.

35:12.737 --> 35:14.537
In advance of our abduction?

35:14.572 --> 35:17.039
Well, he doesn't know that.

35:17.075 --> 35:20.009
We know it's going to come off,
why not save time?

35:20.044 --> 35:21.611
For Caleb's sake.

35:21.646 --> 35:23.746
Oh, I can't take biscuits,
but you can take a knife?

35:23.781 --> 35:25.414
Just a precaution.

35:25.450 --> 35:27.750
I am coming along
to protect you, remember?

35:27.785 --> 35:28.977
More like I'm protecting you.

35:29.002 --> 35:31.120
Rescuing you from strategies
that are doomed to fail.

35:31.155 --> 35:32.722
Well, I don't know about that.

35:32.757 --> 35:35.358
But you are showing
a talent for this business.

35:35.393 --> 35:37.293
A bit cautious, but definite potential.

35:37.328 --> 35:39.161
Now I know what Mary has to put up with.

35:39.197 --> 35:40.563
If I thought it would make
any difference,

35:40.598 --> 35:41.797
I would caution you against

35:41.833 --> 35:45.210
letting passion overwhelm deliberation.

35:45.770 --> 35:48.537
- Isn't that what you just did?
- (chuckling)

35:48.573 --> 35:50.506
<i>(leaves rustling)</i>

35:50.541 --> 35:52.708
Don't move, either of you!

35:52.744 --> 35:54.477
Benjamin Tallmadge.

35:55.813 --> 35:58.147
- Remember me, judge?
- (gun cocking)

35:58.182 --> 36:00.416
Sorry I missed my trial.
Now turn around.

36:01.686 --> 36:03.119
- This is an outrage!
- Don't do this!

36:03.154 --> 36:04.654
Shut up! Both of you.

36:05.990 --> 36:08.224
We're trading you
for a true son of Setauket.

36:08.259 --> 36:10.893
So, don't give us any trouble
and none will come to you.

36:10.928 --> 36:12.762
Best do as he says, son.

36:12.797 --> 36:14.797
Though I wouldn't trust these
traitorous wretches as far as...

36:14.832 --> 36:17.133
<i>Shit.</i>

36:26.544 --> 36:28.711
- What do we do?
- Just wave.

36:28.746 --> 36:30.880
Wave, act like we're all friends.

36:35.753 --> 36:37.153
Whoa.

36:38.856 --> 36:40.823
- Richard!
- Oh, no.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.427
- Who's with you?
- (cocks)

36:44.462 --> 36:46.195
You two take the men on the flanks,

36:46.230 --> 36:48.397
- I'll take the officer.
- Stop!

36:49.267 --> 36:51.167
- No!
- (gunshots)

37:05.583 --> 37:07.216
Tell my wife...

37:09.087 --> 37:10.586
<i>Tell...</i>

37:10.621 --> 37:12.955
I lo...

37:18.096 --> 37:19.895
All right, come on. Come on!

37:19.931 --> 37:22.865
- You murdered them!
- Shut up, Magistrate!

37:22.900 --> 37:25.101
Or the same thing will happen to you.

37:29.140 --> 37:31.240
<i>(Music playing)</i>

37:51.963 --> 37:54.997
(crying)

38:33.805 --> 38:35.938
"Spyhunter General."

38:40.578 --> 38:42.878
Sir, Colonel Cooke to see you, sir.

38:42.914 --> 38:45.047
Show him in. Show him in!

38:47.718 --> 38:49.585
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

38:49.620 --> 38:52.421
Should I pour you a glass
of good Madeira, colonel?

38:52.456 --> 38:54.657
Who is Caleb Brewster?

38:54.692 --> 38:56.325
He's a rebel officer

38:56.360 --> 38:58.460
and a smuggler that we captured.

38:58.496 --> 39:00.462
Well, it seems he has friends.

39:00.498 --> 39:04.867
And now they've kidnapped important
friends of mine and the Crown.

39:04.902 --> 39:07.236
Richard Woodhull of Setauket
and his son.

39:08.506 --> 39:12.241
They want Brewster back
and cash to boot.

39:12.276 --> 39:14.243
Five hundred pounds.

39:16.047 --> 39:18.848
I have evidence that
he is a key rebel spy.

39:18.883 --> 39:21.951
Is that why they want us to pay for
the privilege of trading him back?

39:21.986 --> 39:25.221
- Where is he?
- Bridewell.

39:25.256 --> 39:26.848
"Bridewell"?

39:27.959 --> 39:29.692
Why in God's name
would you dump him there

39:29.727 --> 39:31.227
if you thought him that important?

39:31.262 --> 39:33.429
I didn't dump him.
He's being interrogated.

39:34.465 --> 39:35.598
By whom?

39:36.601 --> 39:38.367
Simcoe: <i>Caleb? Caleb?</i>

39:39.503 --> 39:41.937
<i>(Simcoe mumbling)</i>

39:44.041 --> 39:45.407
It's rude to drift off in the middle

39:45.443 --> 39:47.009
of a conversation.

39:47.044 --> 39:48.911
Ah, you had another sleep again.

39:48.946 --> 39:49.879
It's not bedtime yet.

39:49.914 --> 39:52.548
<i>(Mumbling)</i>

39:54.485 --> 39:55.618
Caleb?

39:56.988 --> 40:00.623
It probably feels like
it can't get much worse.

40:03.394 --> 40:07.096
- Come back. There you are.
- Cooke: <i> Bastards!</i>

40:07.131 --> 40:09.932
- (Arnold mumbling)
- What do you think you're doing?

40:09.967 --> 40:14.803
Simcoe: <i>We're in the middle
of an interrogation, sir.</i>

40:14.839 --> 40:16.605
It's outrageous.

40:16.641 --> 40:18.841
<i>It's outrageous!</i>

40:18.876 --> 40:20.342
Is this how you treat an officer?

40:20.378 --> 40:22.144
He's a smuggler and a spy.

40:22.179 --> 40:24.280
And I'm the Archbishop of Canterbury.

40:26.017 --> 40:29.084
You better pray he can still
be traded for the Woodhulls.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.754
- Woodhulls?
- That's right.

40:31.789 --> 40:35.724
The rebel bastards have kidnapped Judge
Woodhull and his son as payback.

40:36.627 --> 40:38.260
Cut him loose!

40:38.296 --> 40:40.062
Get him cleaned up

40:40.097 --> 40:42.598
or you'll be the one
sitting in shit and piss.

40:42.633 --> 40:45.634
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.

40:45.670 --> 40:48.037
I'm sorry, sir, the evidence
seemed overwhelming.

40:48.072 --> 40:50.172
Damn your evidence.

40:50.207 --> 40:55.478
Just get him ready
while I... find the money.

41:06.157 --> 41:08.924
I'm afraid we must part company.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.360
But I must thank you, Caleb,

41:11.395 --> 41:14.763
for the names you gave me
while in the twilight of pain.

41:16.334 --> 41:18.534
(Whispers) Woodhull will
have plenty of company

41:18.569 --> 41:20.135
on the gallows.
