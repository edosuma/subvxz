00:04.320 --> 00:06.584
Jake, time to go! Get your stuff together!

00:06.689 --> 00:09.591
After you drop him off at his mom's,
you want to see a movie?

00:09.693 --> 00:12.321
- Sure, that sounds good.
- Cool. Enjoy.

00:13.697 --> 00:16.495
Why don't you just tell me
you've got a girl coming over?

00:16.566 --> 00:19.364
- I didn't want to rub your nose in it.
- Thanks.

00:19.669 --> 00:22.934
- She's gorgeous, by the way.
- Wonderful.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.574
Why are you putting Jake's stuff
all over the house?

00:25.675 --> 00:29.509
I want this girl to see I'm not just
another jerk trying to get her into bed.

00:29.579 --> 00:32.070
- I'm a loving uncle.
- Who's trying to get her into bed.

00:32.182 --> 00:34.241
That's the loving part.

00:35.885 --> 00:38.752
This is the book I read to him at bedtime.

00:42.025 --> 00:43.253
You don't read to Jake.

00:43.359 --> 00:45.452
That's why you're going to the movies!

00:45.895 --> 00:47.021
Okay, ready to go.

00:47.097 --> 00:49.258
Is your skateboard still out
by the front door?

00:49.365 --> 00:52.528
- Sorry, I'll bring it in.
- No. Leave it there.

00:52.602 --> 00:56.038
See, I do this thing where
I trip over it, then I bitch a little bit.

00:56.106 --> 00:58.199
I'm harried, but lovable.

00:59.743 --> 01:00.903
- You got everything?
- Yep.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.309
- What about your schoolbooks?
- Oh, right.

01:05.081 --> 01:08.050
So, what time are you expecting
Little Red Riding Hood?

01:08.218 --> 01:10.550
And I'm the big, bad wolf.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.248
Very clever.
And not a bad game to play later.

01:14.758 --> 01:17.625
A little huffing and puffing and blowing.

01:17.727 --> 01:19.160
<i>That's The Three Little Pigs.</i>

01:19.262 --> 01:20.627
Same wolf though, right?

01:21.731 --> 01:24.256
- Okay, I got my schoolbooks.
- And your homework?

01:27.570 --> 01:31.301
Charlie, if you took half the energy
you put into manipulating

01:31.407 --> 01:35.002
casual sexual encounters and used it
to actually build a relationship,

01:35.111 --> 01:36.635
you'd be a lot happier.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.006
Hard to imagine.

01:38.648 --> 01:41.116
Are you saying you never want
to settle down?

01:41.184 --> 01:42.845
You mean get married?

01:42.986 --> 01:44.578
Let me tell you something, bunky.

01:44.654 --> 01:47.680
If you've got someone to clean your house
and do your shopping

01:47.791 --> 01:51.659
and you're getting action on a regular
basis, the only reason you need a wife

01:51.761 --> 01:55.492
is if you have some sick compulsion
to give away half your stuff.

01:55.632 --> 01:58.226
- What about kids?
- I already got one!

01:58.902 --> 02:02.804
And the best part is he leaves before
we get sick of each other. Right, dude?

02:02.872 --> 02:05.067
- Right, dude.
- Okay, let's go.

02:05.241 --> 02:07.072
- Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- See you next week.

02:07.177 --> 02:10.613
- Where are your shoes?
- Oh, right.

02:12.882 --> 02:16.215
I have been so depressed since
the divorce, I've gained eight pounds.

02:16.286 --> 02:18.254
And not one ounce went to my boobs.

02:19.122 --> 02:21.886
Honey, you're still better off
without the rat bastard.

02:21.958 --> 02:24.085
But I miss the rat bastard.

02:24.761 --> 02:28.060
Listen to me, Kathleen.
I thought I missed my husband, too.

02:28.131 --> 02:31.692
But it turned out to be just
a little prescription mix-up.

02:32.202 --> 02:34.295
- Hi, Mom!
- And there's my big boy!

02:34.404 --> 02:37.373
- Don't I get a hug?
- Nope. Gotta drain the lizard.

02:38.808 --> 02:40.139
Boys.

02:40.977 --> 02:42.945
- Hey.
- Hi, Alan.

02:43.046 --> 02:45.207
- He left his homework in the car.
- Thank you.

02:45.281 --> 02:47.647
Hang on, I have some bills
you need to pay.

02:47.984 --> 02:51.750
Great. I hope they're really big ones.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.623
Hi. Alan.

03:01.064 --> 03:03.760
So you must be Judith's support group.

03:03.967 --> 03:07.562
That's funny because
I'm kind of supporting her, too.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.640
It's not funny ha-ha so much as not funny.

03:15.745 --> 03:20.079
Cookies! Maybe this will take
the taste of foot out of my mouth.

03:23.086 --> 03:25.646
So, who's the little baker among us?

03:31.160 --> 03:32.320
Foot.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.728
- Can I have a cookie?
- Sure, sweetie.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.463
- You are so cute!
- I know.

03:40.904 --> 03:42.496
You have a girlfriend yet?

03:42.639 --> 03:44.971
No, I'm a bachelor like my Uncle Charlie.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.009
So, you're never going to get married?

03:47.076 --> 03:51.137
As long as I got someone to clean my
house and action on a regular basis,

03:51.214 --> 03:52.511
I don't need a wife.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.311
Excuse me?

03:56.386 --> 03:58.718
I don't want to give anybody half my stuff.

04:01.424 --> 04:03.153
Okay, bye-bye.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:12.168 --> 04:16.103
This is my favorite part of the house.
I call it God's room.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.397
Are you religious?

04:20.510 --> 04:24.674
Tiffany, how can you not be
when you look at something like that?

04:28.618 --> 04:33.749
In fact, I'm always telling my
little nephew what's important is this.

04:34.958 --> 04:38.257
Not the big house, or the fancy car,

04:38.561 --> 04:41.724
or all the expensive toys
I'm always buying him.

04:46.602 --> 04:48.695
You are amazing.

04:48.771 --> 04:50.238
I don't know many guys that would

04:50.306 --> 04:52.866
make room in their lives
for someone else's child.

04:52.942 --> 04:54.637
He's family.

04:54.978 --> 04:58.812
What kind of a man doesn't make room
in his life for his own family?

05:01.250 --> 05:05.346
Look, it's my brother Alan,
who I also made room in my life for.

05:07.023 --> 05:08.650
Excuse me.

05:10.293 --> 05:11.317
Bro!

05:14.530 --> 05:18.227
All right, you moron, what part of

05:18.301 --> 05:22.795
"stay out, so I can run around naked
with a hot chick" didn't you understand?

05:22.872 --> 05:25.864
I'm sorry, I'm too depressed
to sit through a movie.

05:25.975 --> 05:29.433
And you figured ruining my evening
would cheer you up?

05:32.148 --> 05:34.378
The movie was just a suggestion.

05:34.617 --> 05:37.711
Go bowling, go sit on the curb,
I don't care.

05:37.854 --> 05:39.515
Leave me alone!

05:39.789 --> 05:41.689
- Who's that?
- Judith. Again.

05:41.791 --> 05:43.520
She's really upset with me.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.220
- Man, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

05:45.294 --> 05:46.454
Now get out.

05:47.463 --> 05:49.954
Get out? She's upset with me
because of you!

05:50.033 --> 05:51.625
That's different.

05:52.468 --> 05:54.026
But still, get out.

05:54.470 --> 05:58.304
Your sexist, manipulative attitude towards
women just got into Jake's head,

05:58.374 --> 06:02.003
and he spewed it out in front of his
mother's angry women's support group.

06:02.078 --> 06:05.206
Wait a minute. Is it a women's
support group that's angry?

06:05.381 --> 06:07.872
Or a support group just for angry women?

06:08.384 --> 06:10.045
What difference does it make?

06:10.186 --> 06:13.519
If they are already angry,
then I'm less culpable.

06:15.925 --> 06:17.984
Okay, what did Jake say?

06:18.227 --> 06:22.288
Not much. He just parroted your line
about how women are only good for sex

06:22.398 --> 06:24.195
and cleaning the house.

06:24.267 --> 06:27.464
Charlie, you didn't really say that?

06:28.104 --> 06:29.128
No.

06:30.306 --> 06:33.833
What I said was is that there is really
no reason to get married

06:33.910 --> 06:37.107
if you've already got somebody
to clean and...

06:39.916 --> 06:42.077
You want to go to the movies with me?

06:45.221 --> 06:47.485
Man, Jake's going to love this video game.

06:47.623 --> 06:52.083
Listen to this. "Sixteen levels
of ultra-realistic murder and mayhem,

06:53.463 --> 06:55.988
"twenty-four flesh-ripping weapons,

06:56.466 --> 06:58.764
"plus gratuitous nudity. "

06:59.569 --> 07:00.968
Let me see that.

07:02.105 --> 07:05.905
<i>- "Scooter's Magic Tree Fort"?
- Scooter's a zombie.</i>

07:11.814 --> 07:12.906
It's Tiffany.

07:13.249 --> 07:15.274
She still talking to you after last weekend?

07:15.418 --> 07:18.512
What can I tell you?
I am hard to stay mad at.

07:19.255 --> 07:22.918
Hello? Hey, Tiff.
I've been thinking about you all week.

07:26.162 --> 07:29.757
Yeah, we did get off to a bad start,
and I really blame myself.

07:29.832 --> 07:32.528
No, I'd love to try again.

07:33.836 --> 07:35.633
I'm going to go get Jake,

07:35.705 --> 07:40.074
but I'll leave the front door unlocked in
case Satan shows up to collect your soul.

07:40.176 --> 07:43.475
Wait a minute. Alan?
I gotta put you on hold a sec, Tiff.

07:43.679 --> 07:45.476
How come Judith's not bringing him over?

07:45.548 --> 07:49.177
I don't know. Judith asked me to do it,
and I just got tired of arguing.

07:49.252 --> 07:51.812
She still busting your chops
about what Jake said?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.856
Look, blame it on me.

07:53.923 --> 07:56.050
- Tell her I'm sorry.
- She won't buy it.

07:56.159 --> 07:59.322
Sure she will.
Women are suckers for a good apology.

08:00.429 --> 08:03.887
Just keep shoveling it
on till roses start growing in it.

08:04.867 --> 08:09.861
Poor Satan. He'll come for your soul
and he'll leave empty-handed.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.177
Hey, Tiff, I'm back.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.577
That's kind of harsh.

08:20.116 --> 08:22.243
Wait a minute. Hello?

08:25.288 --> 08:28.280
I see, that's not the hold button.

08:33.895 --> 08:36.386
- Hey, is Jake ready?
- Not exactly.

08:36.465 --> 08:38.763
Maybe you should come in for a second.

08:38.868 --> 08:42.736
Judith, how many times have I asked you
to have him ready when I...

08:44.207 --> 08:45.265
Hello.

08:45.374 --> 08:48.468
- Sit down, Alan. We want to talk to you.
- We?

08:48.778 --> 08:50.609
Yes. Sit down.

08:52.348 --> 08:53.679
Okay.

08:54.150 --> 08:57.085
I guess I can stay for a minute.

09:02.325 --> 09:05.954
- No cookies.
- No cookies.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.788
- Alan, Jake is not here.
- Why not? Where is he?

09:10.866 --> 09:13.926
- He's sleeping over at a friend's.
- What are you talking about?

09:14.003 --> 09:15.163
This is my time with him.

09:15.271 --> 09:18.104
- Yes, I know, but...
- Judith feels she can no longer

09:18.174 --> 09:21.871
allow her son to be exposed
to the toxic influence of your brother.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.205
Wait a second.
We have a custody agreement.

09:25.314 --> 09:29.011
Yes, but Judith feels that
the welfare of her son supersedes that.

09:29.952 --> 09:31.943
- You can't do this!
- Yes, she can.

09:32.021 --> 09:33.818
- Who are you?
- They are my friends.

09:33.889 --> 09:36.289
Wait. What the hell do your friends
have to do with this?

09:36.359 --> 09:39.157
- We love and support her.
- And we won't let you bully her.

09:39.228 --> 09:43.187
Wait. Okay, first of all, can the person
I talk to be the person who answers me?

09:43.299 --> 09:44.664
That's fair.

09:44.900 --> 09:48.529
Okay, I don't want to talk to you people.
This is between me and Judith.

09:48.638 --> 09:51.869
You're absolutely right.
Judith, tell him what we agreed.

09:52.008 --> 09:56.536
Okay. You can see Jake on weekends,
but not at Charlie's house.

09:56.879 --> 09:58.176
But that's where I live.

09:58.247 --> 10:01.148
I'm sorry, Alan, but you're
just going to have to choose

10:01.217 --> 10:03.310
between your son and your brother.

10:03.586 --> 10:08.717
You know what? Maybe I have a problem
with Jake being in this toxic environment.

10:08.924 --> 10:13.361
And I am not leaving until you
bitter old crones are out of my house

10:13.429 --> 10:15.488
and I have my kid back!

10:20.903 --> 10:24.066
All right. You can stay. But I want my kid.

10:27.643 --> 10:29.736
Okay, I will go.

10:37.086 --> 10:39.111
- Morning.
- Hey.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.185
- Where are the pancakes?
- What pancakes?

10:44.527 --> 10:46.722
You always make pancakes
on Saturday morning.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.889
I make them for Jake. Jake's not here.

10:49.131 --> 10:51.827
- Kind of weird without him, huh?
- Yes.

10:52.468 --> 10:55.904
Would it lift your spirits
if you made pancakes for me?

10:57.673 --> 11:00.801
I'm sorry, man.
I told you to blame it all on me.

11:01.177 --> 11:03.975
Charlie, they had moved way past blame.

11:04.146 --> 11:05.909
<i>It was more like a jihad.</i>

11:08.451 --> 11:10.248
Except with no cookies.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.918
Your big mistake was dealing
with them as a group.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.856
The trick with women is to split them
off from the herd, one by one.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.529
Otherwise, they spook
and you risk a stampede.

11:23.199 --> 11:24.530
Kind of like buffalo.

11:25.468 --> 11:28.164
In fact, I will bet that's where
that song comes from.

11:28.337 --> 11:31.636
<i>Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight</i>

11:31.707 --> 11:35.643
<i>Do you hear yourself?
"Buffalo Gals"? Are you insane?</i>

11:35.811 --> 11:38.837
This is the kind of talk
that started this whole mess!

11:38.948 --> 11:40.973
I didn't write the song, Alan.

11:43.319 --> 11:45.344
- Morning.
- Morning, Berta.

11:46.055 --> 11:49.115
- What, no pancakes?
- Jake's not here this weekend.

11:49.191 --> 11:50.351
Why not?

11:52.495 --> 11:55.396
Apparently Jake took something I said
out of context

11:55.464 --> 12:00.231
and repeated it in front of his mother
and she overreacted, as is her nature.

12:00.336 --> 12:01.963
What did you say, numbnuts?

12:02.037 --> 12:06.133
All I said was if your domestic chores
are taken care of by one woman

12:06.242 --> 12:08.870
and you have an active sexual life
with other women,

12:08.978 --> 12:11.003
you don't necessarily need
yet another woman

12:11.080 --> 12:13.071
with whom to tie the matrimonial knot.

12:14.717 --> 12:16.878
And which category do I come in under?

12:18.187 --> 12:22.419
I got to say it's the sweet loving, Berta,
because this place is a mess.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.728
Morning, everybody. I brought
real maple syrup for the pancakes.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.264
- There's no pancakes, Rose.
- Because Jake's not here.

12:30.366 --> 12:32.493
Because Charlie's an idiot.

12:33.903 --> 12:38.067
Why? I mean, "Why is Jake not here?"
Not "Why is Charlie an idiot?"

12:39.408 --> 12:40.568
Because we know that.

12:40.676 --> 12:44.112
Hello? Where's my grandson?

12:44.947 --> 12:46.209
Oh, God, make this stop.

12:46.916 --> 12:48.247
Good morning, all.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.442
- Hi, Mom.
- Morning.

12:49.552 --> 12:51.543
- So, where's Jake?
- Ask Charlie.

12:51.620 --> 12:55.420
- Yeah, ask him.
- Charlie?

12:59.795 --> 13:02.127
See? Just like buffalo.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.864
No, Evelyn, I am sorry.

13:08.938 --> 13:11.463
I want you to be able
to spend time with your grandson

13:11.540 --> 13:13.940
but I just don't want him around Charlie.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.441
Why? Why do you think?

13:17.813 --> 13:19.075
That's right.

13:20.549 --> 13:24.986
No, his attitude toward women is not
a reflection on you or how you raised him.

13:25.087 --> 13:26.384
Yes, it is.

13:28.090 --> 13:30.752
Look, there's someone at the door,
I've got to go.

13:30.993 --> 13:35.760
No, Evelyn, I don't think this would seem
less important if I was "getting a little. "

13:38.801 --> 13:42.567
- Judith, can't we talk about this?
- There's nothing to talk about, Charlie.

13:42.638 --> 13:45.334
Okay. Don't talk. Just listen.

13:45.608 --> 13:48.509
I love Jake and I would never
intentionally do anything

13:48.611 --> 13:52.274
- to influence him in a negative way.
- I don't care about your intentions.

13:52.348 --> 13:56.842
Okay, I am a jerk, I am immature,
I am self-centered, I am...

13:56.952 --> 13:58.078
Hi, I'm Charlie.

13:59.989 --> 14:02.082
Yes, we've heard about you.

14:02.157 --> 14:04.352
And I will bet none of it's good.

14:04.527 --> 14:06.688
- I am sorry, what is your name?
- Linda.

14:06.862 --> 14:08.523
Linda. Really?

14:08.697 --> 14:11.097
I once had my heart broken
by a woman named Linda.

14:11.166 --> 14:12.861
Charlie, we are having a meeting.

14:12.968 --> 14:15.163
And I'll bet it was about me.

14:15.538 --> 14:19.838
- Am I right? Come on, be honest.
- Mandy.

14:20.175 --> 14:23.542
<i>Mandy. I love that song, Mandy.</i>

14:25.514 --> 14:29.348
Listen, I know I can't come in here
and ask to be forgiven

14:29.451 --> 14:32.852
for some of the stupid things
I have said in front of Jake.

14:33.622 --> 14:37.023
But I do have the right
to say I am sorry, don't I?

14:37.793 --> 14:39.283
I suppose.

14:41.497 --> 14:44.955
- Thank you. And you are?
- Kathleen.

14:46.535 --> 14:49.026
Kathleen, a fine Irish name.

14:49.872 --> 14:52.306
Half-Irish, on my mother's side.

14:52.875 --> 14:56.140
- Are you and your mom close?
- Yeah, I guess.

14:56.745 --> 14:58.679
I envy that, Kathleen.

14:59.815 --> 15:03.046
- Me and my mom...
- Okay, Charlie, give it a rest.

15:03.218 --> 15:07.018
We are not a bunch of sorority girls
you can charm with your big, brown eyes.

15:07.089 --> 15:08.579
And nice smile.

15:10.859 --> 15:12.520
Thank you, Mandy.

15:13.095 --> 15:17.361
Linda, I admit I sometimes relate
to women on a very superficial level,

15:17.499 --> 15:19.228
but I think that's because

15:19.335 --> 15:23.499
deep down, I have intimacy issues
that probably go back to my mom.

15:24.707 --> 15:27.198
My mother crippled me emotionally!

15:29.612 --> 15:30.738
You, too?

15:30.846 --> 15:34.111
And I am so afraid I'm making
the same mistakes with my daughter.

15:34.216 --> 15:36.776
- You know what...
- Ruth.

15:41.290 --> 15:44.191
That's the same fear
I have with Jake, Ruth.

15:44.426 --> 15:48.192
I've clearly made mistakes,
but that's because I'm human.

15:49.231 --> 15:52.792
And after all, what're we trying
to do with our children

15:53.035 --> 15:55.902
other than to raise them as humans?

15:58.240 --> 16:01.698
Stop it, Charlie. "Our children"?
You have no children.

16:01.777 --> 16:05.873
That's true. Although I don't think it's fair
to throw it in my face.

16:09.051 --> 16:13.385
I mean, some of us haven't been blessed
with the little ones the way you have.

16:13.956 --> 16:15.821
That was uncalled for, Judith.

16:20.663 --> 16:25.566
Look, I'm being real up-front with you
about the mistakes I've made with Jake.

16:25.634 --> 16:27.568
How I've influenced him.

16:28.137 --> 16:31.664
But let's talk for a minute
about how he's influenced me.

16:32.274 --> 16:37.507
How this little boy has made me
a better man.

16:40.516 --> 16:43.451
Dear God! You are not going to listen
to this crap, are you?

16:43.519 --> 16:46.613
No, I will not...

16:47.589 --> 16:51.685
He's lying to you. That's all he does!
Lie! You've got to believe me.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.530
It's okay. It's all right, Judith.
We are all here for you.

17:02.805 --> 17:05.272
Okay, who's ready for a refill?

17:08.010 --> 17:09.534
That kid.

17:09.678 --> 17:12.044
What are you going to do, huh?

17:12.146 --> 17:14.047
Charlie, where's the little girl's room?

17:14.148 --> 17:17.641
It's down the hall to the right,
and around here we leave the seat up,

17:17.720 --> 17:19.881
so don't just drop trou and back in.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.317
- You are terrible!
- I'm serious.

17:22.391 --> 17:24.951
I'm not coming in there with the shoehorn.

17:26.829 --> 17:29.059
You are getting a little pink there, Kathy.

17:29.164 --> 17:32.065
Turn around, I'll put
some more suntan lotion on your back.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.327
Okay.

17:36.338 --> 17:38.067
- Hi, Alan!
- Hello.

17:38.173 --> 17:41.472
- You have a lovely home.
- Thank you.

17:42.845 --> 17:44.244
What's happening?

17:44.346 --> 17:48.749
A bunch of us came over to have wine
in God's room. Why don't you join us?

17:48.917 --> 17:50.851
Thank you.

17:53.188 --> 17:54.519
What the hell?

17:55.090 --> 17:57.718
<i>Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight</i>

17:57.826 --> 18:00.420
<i>Come out tonight, come out tonight</i>

18:00.529 --> 18:03.521
<i>Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight</i>

18:03.599 --> 18:06.261
<i>And dance by the light of the moon</i>

18:13.275 --> 18:15.743
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, pal!

18:16.445 --> 18:18.106
What's going on?

18:18.447 --> 18:21.507
- I want my friends back.
- I am sorry, what?

18:21.617 --> 18:23.608
- Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- There he is.

18:23.719 --> 18:26.017
How you doing, buddy?
We missed you around here!

18:26.088 --> 18:27.885
- I slept over at Toby's house.
- Cool!

18:27.956 --> 18:30.015
Jake, honey, go put your stuff
in your room.

18:30.092 --> 18:31.116
Okay.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.790
- He's staying?
- Okay, here's the deal.

18:34.897 --> 18:38.856
We go back to the original custody
arrangement, but with one new condition.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.060
What's that?

18:40.135 --> 18:43.104
Charlie agrees to never, ever,
enter my house again.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.200
Done.

18:48.243 --> 18:50.473
- You want some wine?
- Charlie...

18:51.947 --> 18:53.642
Yeah, sure, why not.

18:58.253 --> 18:59.413
How?

19:00.222 --> 19:02.747
I told you, I am hard to stay mad at.

19:05.761 --> 19:08.127
Anyway, they're your problem now.

19:08.831 --> 19:11.664
I am going to hang with Jake
till Tiffany gets here.

19:26.215 --> 19:27.341
What?

19:27.449 --> 19:29.610
You got a normal-sized head.

19:30.652 --> 19:33.177
Thanks. I am pretty happy with it.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.850
- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

19:35.958 --> 19:39.485
I heard Mom say the reason
Uncle Charlie gets into so much trouble

19:39.561 --> 19:41.995
is because he thinks with his little head.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.225
It's not that little.

19:49.171 --> 19:51.969
- Okay, you tell your mother...
- Charlie.

19:53.041 --> 19:55.532
That women are to
be honored and respected.

19:55.644 --> 19:58.169
See, Jake? That's the big head talking.

19:58.247 --> 20:00.340
But he only has one head.

20:02.885 --> 20:05.911
You want to tell him
or should we let him spin for a while?

20:06.021 --> 20:07.579
I'd rather he spin.

20:07.723 --> 20:10.157
Come on, at least give me a clue.

20:11.660 --> 20:12.854
All right.

20:13.662 --> 20:15.789
What do men have that women don't?

20:16.398 --> 20:17.490
Beards.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.494
- Lower.
- Beards.

20:28.844 --> 20:30.869
You're right, let him spin.

21:00.275 --> 21:01.469
