00:35.836 --> 00:37.702

about a female Caucasian

00:37.704 --> 00:40.439
looking to go bootscootin'
on a Saturday night.

00:40.507 --> 00:43.475
- Guilty as charged.
- Hop in.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.713

00:48.715 --> 00:50.515
if he knew I was going
on a date with a cop.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.184
- My dad's the police captain.

00:52.252 --> 00:55.053
He'd kill me if he knew I was
going out with a firefighter,

00:55.121 --> 00:56.789

to arrest him.

I'm officially a BFB.

I heard of that program.

01:55.582 --> 01:57.049
That's where they get
a firefighter to mentor some,

01:57.117 --> 01:58.983
like, "troubled youth"
or whatever, right?

01:58.985 --> 02:00.452
- I've wanted to do this
for a long time

02:01.922 --> 02:03.722

02:29.083 --> 02:30.815
- No.
- Bam!

to be Brute Force Fuel.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.060
It could be Mega Force Fuel.

I still gotta redo my makeup,
put the dress back on,

05:25.259 --> 05:27.125

with the bridesmaids.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.127
That's gonna take,

on purpose.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.131

05:35.936 --> 05:37.069

- Yeah.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.470
I wonder if it still works.

05:41.007 --> 05:45.009

Get the kid to do
the inventory for us, right?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.088
We'll whip his ass into shape.
- Come on, Ike.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.689
It's not about
whipping him into shape.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.957
It's about connecting
to his heart, man.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.692
There's no such thing
as a bad kid.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.495
Just a bad role model.
- Ah, good point, Granny.

I'm your BFB.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.663
- Where the hell is she?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.132

07:34.054 --> 07:36.721

spit it out, McConky?

07:36.723 --> 07:38.723

come to work today,

Jerry Jr.

- He's from my first marriage.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.933
I'm trying to reconnect,

07:49.003 --> 07:50.535

on the force a few weeks ago

- Save it for your barber.
What's that got to do with me?

07:55.542 --> 07:59.011
- Well, he told me yesterday
that he had a "hot date"

07:59.079 --> 08:04.148
at Il Lobsterino,
and he was "fired up" about it.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.685
- No, there is no way
my daughter went on a date

08:06.753 --> 08:08.821
with a Tacoma cop,
especially your son.

08:08.889 --> 08:12.424
- Okay, it does seem like
a strange coincidence

08:12.493 --> 08:14.759
that they're both
at Il Lobsterino

08:14.829 --> 08:16.695

<i> my police detective hat on--</i>

08:20.501 --> 08:21.700
- No way.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.168
- I know I said
she was with a guy,

08:23.237 --> 08:25.103
but she's definitely
not with Polonsky, Jr.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.905
- I would bet my entire pension

08:26.973 --> 08:28.707
she wasn't out
with Polonsky, Jr.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.576
- And I wouldn't take that bet
because I'd lose.

08:31.578 --> 08:32.777
- Right? No way!
- She's not with him.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.513
There's no way.

08:34.581 --> 08:35.714
- There's no way.
- No, there's no way.

Oh, God.

- Okay, all right, calm down.
Relax, just count to 10.

Can you OD from pot brownies?

08:50.597 --> 08:52.130
- You're fine.
- Are you sure?

08:52.199 --> 08:55.067
'Cause I don't feel fine.
I don't feel fine at all.

Look at me.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.539
Tell me something
about yourself.

09:00.607 --> 09:03.742
- When my mom left my dad,
she made me dye my hair black

09:03.810 --> 09:05.810
so that I wouldn't
remind her of him.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.480
- Let's focus on something
a little more upbeat.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.082
- Okay, uh...

09:10.150 --> 09:13.085
I always wanted
to express myself through art.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.819
- Really?

09:14.889 --> 09:17.556
- Yeah, I have sketches
if you want to see.

09:17.624 --> 09:18.891
- Hell yeah,
I wanna see your sketches.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.559
- You do?
- Yeah.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.361
- They're in the pocket
behind my chair.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.097
- Here, let me get it.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.433
- I can't reach.
I can't reach.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.034
- I got it.

09:30.104 --> 09:32.637
- Okay.
I've been teaching myself.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.839
Picassi's always been
a hero of mine.

09:34.909 --> 09:36.641
- You mean Picasso?
- No.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.510
Greg Picassi,
he's the sketch artist

09:38.579 --> 09:40.044
at the station.
- Mm.

09:40.114 --> 09:41.980
- I've always dreamed of
drawing the face of a bad guy

09:42.048 --> 09:44.783
from the memory
of an unreliable witness.

09:44.851 --> 09:48.053
Check it out.
- Wow.

09:49.924 --> 09:54.793
Oh, these are--
they're unbelievable.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.929
- You don't mean that.
- No, I really do.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.865
I think these show
a lot of potential.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.002
- You're just saying that.
- I think that they're great.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.005
- Oh, I'm freaking
losing it, man.

10:07.074 --> 10:10.609
I'm losing it.
- Dude, keep it together.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.544
- Oh, God,
whatever happens to me,

10:12.613 --> 10:15.013
don't let me
jump off this building.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.616
- We're in a car
stuck in a ditch.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.551
- [breathes rapidly]
I'm having--

10:19.620 --> 10:21.486
I'm giving birth.
I'm giving birth.

10:21.555 --> 10:24.022

Pull, roll, pull,

Yep, and you roll.

10:37.871 --> 10:38.937
You pull, and you roll.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.672
It's even.
That's awesome.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.207
You're really getting
the hang of this, man.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.609
- Is this what you do all day?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.077
- Hey, come here.
Stand up.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.148
Hunter, being a firefighter
is a way of life.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.949
We live by a code.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.818
- Yeah, like when your relief
doesn't show up

10:52.886 --> 10:55.620

and you have to fucking stay.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.823

Lady firefighter said fuck.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.758

- Eight

- All right, look, Hunter,
when I got out

11:02.029 --> 11:05.230
of the military,
I had no direction, no purpose.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.899
- [snores]
- Firefighting gave that to me.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.101
- Dude, I didn't come in
to do your job for you.

11:10.171 --> 11:11.903
Just tell me how
to burn down a building.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.639
- Oily rags and accelerant--
arsonist's best friend.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.241
- Ike.
- He wants to learn.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.976
I'm trying to tell him.
- He doesn't want to learn.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.311
- All right, Hunter,
all I'm saying is

11:20.313 --> 11:22.914
you remind me of me
when I was a kid.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.116
- And then you grew up
to be an old bald dude

11:25.118 --> 11:26.585
with a feminine nickname.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.053
- We got a car in ditch
up at Oak Point.

It's so crazy
'cause you're, like, so hot,

11:36.997 --> 11:38.864
but then
when I smush your face,

11:38.932 --> 11:41.733
you're like--
you're like a baby.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.803
You're like a hot baby.
That's a weird thing to say.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.006
- Dude, I told you
stop squeezing my face.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.741
- Oh, right.
Yeah, okay.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.142
Yeah, hey, cool, yeah.

11:51.212 --> 11:53.612
- Good morning.
How's everyone doing in here?

11:53.680 --> 11:56.748
- Oh, my God, Cap,
you are a sight for sore eyes.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.083
- No pain?
You can wiggle your toes?

11:58.151 --> 11:59.284
- Yeah, we're okay.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.952
- Good 'cause we
want to make fun of you.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.888
- Yeah, totally.
- Just get me out of here.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.823
- Hey, Luce, there's someone
who wants to talk to you.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.758
- Okay.
- You lied to everyone.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.093
You went out with a cop,

12:08.161 --> 12:09.828
and you did the weed
in his car.

12:09.897 --> 12:13.031
- I didn't do the weed.
- Excuse me, Chief.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.833
Can I go--
- Not now, Delilah.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.436
- What I don't understand
is why you violated

12:17.504 --> 12:19.771
an unwritten firefighter rule
of never dating a cop.

12:19.773 --> 12:20.906
- So you're telling me

12:20.974 --> 12:22.908
that if a super hot,
dumb, female cop

12:22.976 --> 12:24.375
asked you on a date
and offered to buy you

12:24.377 --> 12:25.977
a lobster dinner, you'd say no?

12:25.979 --> 12:28.113

- She makes a very valid point.
Thank you for opening my eyes.

12:31.252 --> 12:34.185
- It was Polonsky's son!
- Also a valid point!

12:34.187 --> 12:35.921
- All I did was go out
on a date with a dude

12:35.989 --> 12:37.656
who drove his car into a ditch.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.658
- No, you let your shift down.
- Mm-hmm.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.192
- Delilah had
a wedding to go to.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.661
- It's totally fine.
No harm, no foul.

12:42.730 --> 12:44.663
If I leave right now,
I can still--

12:44.731 --> 12:47.266
- I'm sorry, but it's clear
Lucy is still high on the weed

12:47.334 --> 12:49.068
and unable
to perform her station duties.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.869
- I'm not high!
I can work, Dad!

12:50.938 --> 12:52.737
- Please, my sister's
my best friend,

12:52.806 --> 12:54.205
and I made a promise to my dad
on his deathbed...

12:54.275 --> 12:55.874
- Thank you, Delilah.
- That I would be there...

12:55.943 --> 12:57.743
- Get back to work.
- For her to walk her down--

12:57.811 --> 13:01.080
- Dad, what is wrong with you?
Delilah, I am so sorry.

13:01.148 --> 13:04.783

to be connecting with him.

- I'm telling you,
time for Plan B--tough love.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.637
- You guys,
any kid who's that much

13:25.639 --> 13:26.905

just the way to do it.

- What do you want, grandma?

13:38.986 --> 13:42.253
- All right, buddy,
look, I get it, okay?

13:42.323 --> 13:44.790
When I was young, I thought
I was a tough guy too.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.925
I didn't know
how to talk about my feelings

playing with dollies?

14:00.341 --> 14:02.207
- I'm not a dolly.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.677
I'm part of an ancient art form
that takes great skill to use.

14:05.746 --> 14:07.546
You should try it.

It's Bucko, the dog.
Here.

14:12.085 --> 14:16.087
Come on.
You got anything to say, Bucko?

14:16.157 --> 14:19.624
- You can't tell me what to do
'cause you're not my dad.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.859
- And what's your dad like?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.697
- He left when I was six,

ever seen "Avatar"?

15:06.273 --> 15:08.007
- What?

15:08.075 --> 15:11.076
- In "Avatar"

Jerry Jr. like this.

He truly loves your daughter

we've had our differences,

But the best part is that you
are such a dumb son of a bitch
