00:07.591 --> 00:09.551
So, what are you so afraid of?

00:09.718 --> 00:11.261
I'm not afraid.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.306
I'm not. I'm just not sure.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.265
- Not sure of what?
- Josh.

00:16.475 --> 00:19.853
- He wants to have the talk with Piper.
- What talk?

00:20.020 --> 00:24.608
Three dates, no sex. There could only
be one talk he's talking about. The talk.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.693
Safe sex, prior partners.

00:26.902 --> 00:30.280
- Standard dating protocol.
- And sex equals relationship.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.240
And you're not sure
you wanna be a couple.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.910
Well, it's not that I don't like him.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.495
Then what's wrong with
being a couple?

00:36.661 --> 00:41.875
Well, I thought Leo and I were a couple.
And then we coupled, and he took off.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.378
Well, men seem to have a different
definition of coupling than women do.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.465
I do not think that's why Leo left.

00:49.799 --> 00:52.010
- Hey, Prue.
- Hey, Dee. How are you?

00:52.177 --> 00:54.137
- Hey, how's the party going?
- Great.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.098
We're playing Squish the Squash,
and nobody's been able to catch me.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.727
- Is the cake ready?
- Yeah, give us about five minutes.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.646
Awesome. Hey, guys,
five minutes until the cake.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.482
Thanks for doing all this, Piper.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.650
I never would've
been able to afford...

01:07.859 --> 01:10.653
Oh, hey, what are friends for?
Besides, it's worth it

01:10.862 --> 01:13.573
- just to see the look on David's face.
- He's such a great kid.

01:13.781 --> 01:15.950
Yeah, I know.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.996
So much for my Saturday off.
That was Claire.

01:20.496 --> 01:24.334
Something at the auction house needs
to be appraised, so I gotta go. Sorry.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.877
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.920
Bye.

01:28.463 --> 01:31.674
- There's no cheating.
- Be quiet.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.259
You cheated. That's not fair.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.344
I'll get it.

01:50.818 --> 01:52.111
Help!

01:52.320 --> 01:54.197
Let go of me.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.365
- Help!
- David, no.

02:09.377 --> 02:12.006
No! Help!

02:12.715 --> 02:14.050
Leave me alone.

02:14.258 --> 02:15.760
Help.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.971
Let go of me.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.848
Help me.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.018
Help. Let go.

02:24.226 --> 02:25.728
Help!

02:27.688 --> 02:30.024
Let go of me.

04:23.303 --> 04:25.096
- What did you tell him?
- I saw a creature

04:25.263 --> 04:28.266
- with whirling eyes take David.
- And what did he say?

04:28.433 --> 04:30.518
What do you think he said?
He thought I was nuts.

04:30.685 --> 04:33.938
Yeah, well, it turns out David's
not the first one to be taken.

04:34.105 --> 04:38.026
An inspector told me that
another boy disappeared yesterday

04:38.192 --> 04:39.819
in the exact same spot.

04:39.986 --> 04:42.572
A demon who steals kids.
Does it get any worse?

04:42.739 --> 04:47.577
Yeah. Apparently it also happened
20 years ago. Same park, two kids.

04:47.743 --> 04:51.581
- Did they ever find the kids?
- I don't know.

04:53.166 --> 04:57.295
- You know, I could've saved him.
- Prue, don't go there.

04:57.712 --> 05:00.673
No, I was just so surprised,
and I looked down at my hand and...

05:00.840 --> 05:03.342
It was the first time you channelled
it through your hands.

05:03.551 --> 05:05.261
Give yourself a break.

05:05.511 --> 05:08.597
- Your power's growing.
- Yeah, I just hope no one saw me.

05:08.764 --> 05:10.141
Okay, look on the bright side.

05:10.308 --> 05:13.227
You won't have to squint
your eyes anymore.

05:13.394 --> 05:15.396
You were starting to get
those little lines.

05:18.232 --> 05:20.234
- So how's Dee doing?
- Not good.

05:20.443 --> 05:24.405
It's frustrating not being able to tell her
who we are and how we can help.

05:24.613 --> 05:26.824
<i>Yeah, well, the sooner we get
to the Book of Shadows,</i>

05:26.991 --> 05:28.576
the sooner we can get
David back home.

05:28.742 --> 05:32.663
An albino demon with whirling eyes.
Sounds like a whole chapter to me.

05:34.957 --> 05:37.835
I forgot about the appraisal.

05:38.002 --> 05:40.296
It's okay, just go. Phoebe
and I can look in the book,

05:40.462 --> 05:42.464
- and we'll call if we find anything.
- You sure?

05:42.631 --> 05:46.927
Don't you just hate cell phones?
Always out of range.

05:47.094 --> 05:49.138
Call me.

06:07.239 --> 06:08.574
Let go of me.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.534
Help!

06:12.119 --> 06:14.204
Leave me alone.

06:14.371 --> 06:17.541
Help!
Help me.

06:19.543 --> 06:21.878
Let go of me!

06:46.486 --> 06:48.780
I can't see.

06:48.989 --> 06:51.533
Why can't I see?

06:51.700 --> 06:53.285
Mom?

06:53.910 --> 06:55.078
Mom!

06:58.164 --> 07:00.333
Nothing.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.546
- Did you look under "whirling eyes"?
- About an hour ago.

07:04.713 --> 07:06.589
I found demons with no eyes,

07:06.756 --> 07:09.467
demons with four eyes,
eyes that grow legs,

07:09.634 --> 07:11.136
but no whirling eyes.

07:11.302 --> 07:12.762
Did you find anything?

07:12.971 --> 07:17.142
I found some news clippings
about the kidnappings 20 years ago.

07:17.308 --> 07:20.061
Both boys were taken
in the same place as David.

07:20.228 --> 07:23.773
And one of them
was never seen again.

07:24.482 --> 07:27.277
- Oh, great.
- But the other one was found.

07:27.443 --> 07:31.406
It's right here.
His name was Brent Miller.

07:33.074 --> 07:35.827
Look, honey, I know you're upset,
but that's not gonna help you.

07:36.452 --> 07:40.540
It's not for me, it's for Dee.
I'm taking her a care package.

07:40.707 --> 07:43.292
- Keep reading.
- "Brent Miller was discovered

07:43.459 --> 07:46.087
two days after he was taken,
roaming the streets.

07:46.254 --> 07:48.548
He was fine except...

07:48.715 --> 07:50.633
...he'd gone blind."

07:50.800 --> 07:52.218
- Blind?
- Yeah.

07:52.385 --> 07:56.055
He claimed that some storm-drain
monsters stole his eyesight. Of course,

07:56.264 --> 07:58.975
the authorities believed
he had just caught a parasite.

08:00.184 --> 08:02.520
We can't tell Dee
that her son might be blinded.

08:02.687 --> 08:06.065
Well, maybe if I could find
this Brent Miller guy on the Web,

08:06.232 --> 08:08.859
he might know something
that could help us.

08:09.026 --> 08:14.240
- I hope you're right.
- Piper, we're gonna find David.

08:28.921 --> 08:30.673
- Prue Halliwell?
- Yes?

08:30.840 --> 08:33.926
<i>Hi, Eric Lohman,
Bay Weekly. Alternative press.</i>

08:34.092 --> 08:36.636
- Maybe you heard of us?
- Sorry.

08:37.304 --> 08:38.764
No? Well, you will.

08:38.931 --> 08:41.475
I was hoping you could help me
with a story I'm working on.

08:41.683 --> 08:45.437
- On the auction business?
- No, actually on magic.

08:46.272 --> 08:48.524
- Magic? Why would you come to me?
- I don't know.

08:48.732 --> 08:51.610
Maybe because I saw you
levitate two people in the park

08:51.777 --> 08:53.904
with just a wave of your hand.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.949
I take that as a "no comment."

08:59.118 --> 09:02.246
So, what are you, anyway?
Some kind of a David Copperfield,

09:02.413 --> 09:04.206
Lance Burton?

09:04.373 --> 09:07.918
- A freak of nature?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

09:08.085 --> 09:09.962
Look, Prue. Your friends
call you Prue, right?

09:10.170 --> 09:11.588
I would like for you to leave.

09:11.755 --> 09:13.382
Well, tough. Get over it.

09:13.549 --> 09:15.259
I had my police sources
check you out.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.344
It's interesting how your name
keeps popping up

09:17.511 --> 09:19.596
in all these unsolved
murder cases, don't you think?

09:19.805 --> 09:22.307
- What's that have to do with anything?
- Maybe nothing.

09:22.516 --> 09:25.602
But if I wrote an article on it,
it might look like something.

09:27.354 --> 09:30.107
- Your boss subscribe to my paper?
- Don't threaten me.

09:30.315 --> 09:34.695
What are you gonna do? Are you
gonna make me fly into a wall?

09:34.861 --> 09:36.822
Come on.

09:42.869 --> 09:44.996
How clumsy of me.

09:47.958 --> 09:50.919
Bet that took a lot of self-control, huh?
Not to use your powers.

09:51.086 --> 09:53.088
You're a real credit
to your profession.

09:53.255 --> 09:55.006
You know, that kid saw
what I saw too.

09:55.173 --> 09:57.592
Cops get him, he's all
the corroborating evidence I need.

09:57.801 --> 10:00.845
- Security.
- Prue, be smart. Work with me.

10:01.012 --> 10:04.015
I'm gonna break this story one way
or the other. And when I do,

10:04.224 --> 10:06.142
I can either make you
sound like Wonder Woman

10:06.309 --> 10:09.062
or the devil incarnate. Okay?

10:09.229 --> 10:10.939
Think about it.

10:23.284 --> 10:24.702
Mr Miller will be in shortly.

10:25.870 --> 10:28.456
Wow, what a great view.

10:28.623 --> 10:33.044
- You can smell the ocean.
- And hear the traffic.

10:34.379 --> 10:36.798
- Brent Miller?
- That's what they tell me.

10:37.257 --> 10:40.343
- Hi, I'm Phoebe Halliwell.
- Phoebe,

10:40.510 --> 10:42.679
allow me to introduce you
to Helmeth.

10:42.845 --> 10:45.640
He's beautiful. So is this place.

10:45.807 --> 10:48.059
Well, didn't think a blind guy
could live so well, huh?

10:48.226 --> 10:50.687
Oh, no. No, that's not
what I meant at all.

10:50.853 --> 10:54.649
I know you didn't. No, I design
software for the visually impaired.

10:54.816 --> 10:58.653
Life has been good to me.
So how can I help you, Phoebe?

10:58.861 --> 11:02.573
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about...

11:04.116 --> 11:06.786
...when you were kidnapped
as a child.

11:06.953 --> 11:08.788
I'm sorry. I'm not...

11:09.372 --> 11:11.123
I'm not very comfortable
talking about that.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.209
I understand.
But I read a lot about it...

11:13.417 --> 11:15.378
I said, I'm not interested
in talking about it.

11:15.586 --> 11:19.507
- Okay, but this just isn't for me...
- I said, no!

11:19.674 --> 11:22.385
Is everything all right, Mr Miller?

11:22.551 --> 11:26.972
Yes. Lucy, please just show
this lady to the front door.

11:27.139 --> 11:28.891
Miss.

11:29.767 --> 11:33.104
No, you know what? I'm not leaving.
It's happening again.

11:33.312 --> 11:36.190
In the last 24 hours,
two little boys were kidnapped

11:36.357 --> 11:38.901
from the same park that you were.

11:39.068 --> 11:41.529
Maybe by the same
monsters that took you.

11:46.784 --> 11:48.911
It's all right, Lucy.

11:53.332 --> 11:58.963
You believe my story
about the monsters?

11:59.129 --> 12:00.881
- Yes, I do.
- Why,

12:01.090 --> 12:03.425
- when everyone has always laughed?
- Maybe it's because

12:03.592 --> 12:07.179
I've seen my share of monsters,
and I haven't told anybody about them

12:07.388 --> 12:10.349
because I didn't want them
to laugh at me either.

12:10.933 --> 12:14.645
Mr Miller, I know that you wouldn't
want what happened to you

12:14.812 --> 12:17.481
to happen to these two little boys.

12:17.898 --> 12:19.733
Please.

12:24.947 --> 12:29.326
There were two of them.
I mean, terrifying creatures, really.

12:29.493 --> 12:31.119
They...

12:32.037 --> 12:35.040
...dragged me into a storm drain,
to a junction of some kind.

12:35.248 --> 12:39.711
They held me down. I remember
blue sparks hitting my face.

12:39.878 --> 12:41.588
My eyes felt like they were on fire.

12:41.797 --> 12:45.342
And that was
the last thing I ever saw.

12:45.884 --> 12:48.678
Why do you think
they took your eyesight?

12:48.845 --> 12:51.181
I don't know.

12:51.348 --> 12:55.852
But I remember them saying
something about auras.

13:11.326 --> 13:13.953
Thanks again for the tickets.

14:03.586 --> 14:07.840
Auras, auras. I know
I saw something in here.

14:08.508 --> 14:11.219
Here it is, auras. Grimlocks.

14:11.385 --> 14:13.888
"Underground demons
who roam from city to city,

14:14.055 --> 14:15.681
killing powerful forces of good

14:15.890 --> 14:17.975
by seeing the unique auras
that surround them."

14:18.142 --> 14:22.146
"Which they're able to do by stealing
the sight of innocent children."

14:22.313 --> 14:24.941
So they're like hit men
for the dark side.

14:25.107 --> 14:30.279
"The stolen eyesight will last 24 hours,
but only if the children are alive."

14:30.446 --> 14:34.325
Which means we have less
than 14 hours. "To destroy a Grimlock,

14:34.492 --> 14:38.621
- gather Schisandra root..."
- Piper? Phoebe?

14:43.667 --> 14:45.503
- I know that look.
- What's wrong?

14:45.669 --> 14:48.047
A reporter saw me
use my powers at the park

14:48.214 --> 14:50.424
and is threatening to write
an article about it.

14:50.591 --> 14:52.468
- What?
- Does he have any proof?

14:52.635 --> 14:55.179
- Just what he saw.
- So it's your word against his.

14:55.387 --> 14:59.475
The difference is, his word is delivered
to a half million homes each week.

14:59.642 --> 15:02.895
Everything happens for a reason.
Maybe it's time to let the world know.

15:03.062 --> 15:05.981
Piper, being outed would only
make our lives worse.

15:06.190 --> 15:08.734
We don't know that. At least
I could tell Dee what we're doing

15:08.901 --> 15:10.986
- and give her some hope.
- No, Prue's right.

15:11.195 --> 15:14.364
If we're exposed, we're gonna have
every crazy hounding us day and night.

15:14.531 --> 15:16.617
Not to mention the media circus
on our front lawn.

15:16.784 --> 15:18.702
<i>- Remember E. T.?
- We can't worry about that.</i>

15:18.869 --> 15:21.038
We have to find those boys.
I'm gonna go and see Josh

15:21.205 --> 15:24.082
and see if he has a map
or something of the storm drains.

15:24.249 --> 15:27.669
- Storm drains?
- It's where these demons live.

15:27.878 --> 15:30.964
Well, there's gotta be at least
100 miles of storm drains in the city.

15:31.173 --> 15:34.009
I'll talk to Brent and see if he can
remember where they took him.

15:34.218 --> 15:35.802
Brent?

15:36.011 --> 15:38.555
<i>Prue, the Book of Shadows said
the only way to kill a Grimlock</i>

15:38.722 --> 15:41.350
is to blind it with a potion
made from Schisandra root.

15:41.516 --> 15:43.060
- Can you find some?
- Yeah, I'll try,

15:43.226 --> 15:45.437
as long as that reporter
isn't following me.

15:45.604 --> 15:47.731
Okay, be back soon.

15:49.858 --> 15:52.944
Hey, what if Josh
wants to have the talk?

15:53.111 --> 15:55.363
I'll tell him I have a headache.

15:55.864 --> 15:57.866
All right.

16:03.705 --> 16:05.707
Anything on the night sheet?

16:05.874 --> 16:08.376
Medical examiner.
Thank you. Sent this over.

16:08.543 --> 16:10.253
It's Jerry Cartwright.

16:10.420 --> 16:11.713
A saint.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.215
Donated millions to the
city's anti-drug program.

16:14.382 --> 16:17.260
- M.E.'s saying he was murdered?
- Unless we tell him otherwise.

16:17.469 --> 16:19.387
He's listing the c.o.d.
As a strangulation.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.182
Problem is, the man died
in the middle of a crowd of people

16:22.349 --> 16:25.060
and nobody saw anyone
lay a hand on him.

16:25.268 --> 16:26.644
Inspector Trudeau?

16:28.396 --> 16:30.774
<i>Eric Lohman, Bay Weekly.</i>

16:30.940 --> 16:32.817
He's all yours.

16:33.276 --> 16:35.862
I know who you are.
What do you want?

16:36.488 --> 16:39.157
Cup of coffee would be great.

16:40.116 --> 16:44.329
Okay. What do you say I pick
your brain about Prue Halliwell?

16:44.495 --> 16:46.206
Name ring a bell?

16:46.623 --> 16:47.916
It should.

16:48.082 --> 16:50.710
Her name keeps popping up
in a lot of your murder cases.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.588
A lot of the unsolved ones.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.799
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah, I got my sources.

16:57.342 --> 17:00.345
Cops love to talk, especially
if you pay them enough.

17:01.346 --> 17:02.889
Get the hell out of here.

17:03.097 --> 17:07.518
So I assume you know all about
Prue's unusual powers, right?

17:08.269 --> 17:10.146
Boy, that stopped you cold.

17:10.313 --> 17:13.648
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, right. That's what she said too.

17:13.816 --> 17:16.109
You two rehearse
your stories or what?

17:16.277 --> 17:18.905
I saw her in action
in the park, Trudeau.

17:19.363 --> 17:22.617
She waved her hands and magically
suspended the David Hatcher kid

17:22.992 --> 17:24.993
and his kidnapper in midair.

17:25.161 --> 17:26.537
It was...

17:26.871 --> 17:30.333
It was very cool.
I just wish I had my camera.

17:30.541 --> 17:32.335
Care to comment?

17:33.210 --> 17:35.046
No.

17:36.088 --> 17:38.883
Okay, I'll just change my story
to a police cover-up instead.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.052
- I'm not covering up anything.
- Really?

17:41.260 --> 17:44.430
Great, then I guess you've got
nothing to worry about.

17:45.097 --> 17:48.434
Just remember, I gave you
a chance to work with me.

17:52.146 --> 17:53.898
That's right.

17:57.193 --> 18:00.446
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.240
You're gonna have to handle
the M.E. case on your own.

18:03.407 --> 18:05.951
Why? Where are you going?

18:06.118 --> 18:09.038
I'm assigning myself
to the kidnappings.

18:16.336 --> 18:18.005
Why exactly do you need this?

18:19.006 --> 18:23.427
A client at Quake is thinking
of throwing an underground rave

18:23.635 --> 18:26.722
- and we might cater it.
- A party in a storm drain?

18:27.097 --> 18:30.601
Yeah, he runs a
Roto-Rooter-type company.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.352
It's kind of a theme thing.

18:32.561 --> 18:34.938
Yeah. Well, sounds dank.

18:35.147 --> 18:40.527
Yeah. Look, anyway, as long
as you're here, can we talk?

18:41.111 --> 18:45.282
- Maybe later. I have to go.
- No, Piper. It cannot wait.

18:45.449 --> 18:47.117
Somebody's a little anxious, huh?

18:47.284 --> 18:50.620
This is important. It could
affect the rest of my life.

18:50.787 --> 18:54.541
Well, not if we take precautions.

18:55.542 --> 18:58.044
- What?
- I'm not saying I'm ready for that.

18:58.211 --> 19:00.714
Because, in fact,
I'm not ready for that.

19:00.881 --> 19:02.799
But when I am ready for that,
I'm just saying

19:02.966 --> 19:05.343
I will be taking precautions.

19:05.510 --> 19:08.889
Piper, what are you talking about?

19:10.432 --> 19:12.726
Having sex.

19:18.064 --> 19:20.609
You're not talking
about that, are you?

19:20.817 --> 19:22.652
What are you talking about?

19:22.819 --> 19:25.405
- My leaving.
- Leaving?

19:25.572 --> 19:27.615
Yeah, I got offered a job
down in Beverly Hills.

19:27.824 --> 19:31.369
I mean, it's not exactly my dream job,
but it's a good opportunity.

19:31.536 --> 19:35.248
Look, my point is,
if I thought we had a future...

19:35.457 --> 19:38.752
Josh, this is all just happening
a little too fast.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.338
Yeah. I know, I know,
and I'm sorry. But like it or not,

19:42.547 --> 19:44.090
you are the swing vote.

19:44.299 --> 19:47.468
Now, if you don't
want me to go, I won't.

19:54.517 --> 19:57.562
Okay, we need to talk about this.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.939
If I ask you to stay,
then we're a couple.

20:00.106 --> 20:02.066
And I'm not sure
if I'm ready to be a couple.

20:02.233 --> 20:03.901
But if I tell you to leave,

20:04.068 --> 20:05.528
and we could've been
a good couple,

20:05.695 --> 20:08.322
then I'll never know if we...

20:08.990 --> 20:10.283
I need more time.

20:10.491 --> 20:13.327
I need lots and lots of time.

20:17.665 --> 20:20.084
Hold that thought. Okay?

20:21.460 --> 20:23.754
Yeah, hello.

20:31.596 --> 20:33.055
I remember their faces.

20:33.264 --> 20:36.267
It's like a nightmare
that never ends.

20:37.727 --> 20:42.023
They took me into this big area.

20:42.189 --> 20:44.316
And there were a lot of pipes.

20:44.734 --> 20:47.528
I'm sorry. I mean,
that's really all I remember.

20:48.279 --> 20:50.573
- That's okay, Brent.
- You're disappointed.

20:50.781 --> 20:52.324
No, no. Not at all.

20:52.908 --> 20:55.828
No. Someone that could
see your face might believe you,

20:56.036 --> 20:58.539
but your voice tells another story.

20:58.706 --> 21:01.083
Gave me away, huh?

21:02.793 --> 21:04.628
You have a beautiful smile, Phoebe.

21:05.421 --> 21:07.423
- How can you tell?
- I can hear it in your voice.

21:07.631 --> 21:10.050
I can see it in my mind.

21:20.561 --> 21:24.106
- What's the matter, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

21:24.273 --> 21:27.317
Brent, when they took you,

21:27.484 --> 21:32.072
were you wearing a sweatshirt
with jeans and black high-tops?

21:32.281 --> 21:34.366
Yeah. Yeah,
I think I was. How did you...?

21:34.575 --> 21:36.869
And when you escaped,
were you running through water?

21:37.077 --> 21:38.704
Yes. I remember that,
in the tunnel.

21:38.871 --> 21:41.164
Okay, Brent,
I need you to think really hard.

21:41.540 --> 21:44.167
Do you remember anything?

21:44.376 --> 21:46.128
Anything at all about that location?

21:46.295 --> 21:50.382
Did you hear anything
or feel anything?

21:51.883 --> 21:54.261
All I remember is this...

21:55.345 --> 21:59.057
...sound of this enormous
generator and...

22:02.102 --> 22:05.564
- Maybe some cable cars.
- Cable cars?

22:06.106 --> 22:08.692
- Yeah.
- Hey, do you have a map?

22:08.859 --> 22:13.947
- Oh. Oh! That... That was so stupid.
- No.

22:14.114 --> 22:18.451
I actually do have a map
of that area. It's over here.

22:21.121 --> 22:23.665
What are we looking for exactly?

22:23.832 --> 22:26.334
I don't know, a cable car
turnaround, maybe.

22:26.501 --> 22:29.921
Or the generator that you heard
could've been a power plant.

22:30.130 --> 22:32.632
Right, okay.

22:33.883 --> 22:36.553
Here. Now.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.180
See, on this map...

22:39.347 --> 22:43.059
Okay, there are two
turnarounds on this page.

22:43.226 --> 22:46.479
And there's a...

22:46.646 --> 22:47.814
Right, here it is.

22:47.981 --> 22:51.401
There's a power plant
right here on Varick.

22:51.901 --> 22:54.237
How can you tell?

22:54.404 --> 22:55.822
Well, give me your hand.

22:57.282 --> 23:01.494
Okay, you feel these
three horizontal bumps

23:01.661 --> 23:04.622
followed by the two vertical.

23:04.831 --> 23:09.752
On this... On this map,
that's the symbol for power plant.

23:11.796 --> 23:13.464
I better go.

23:13.631 --> 23:17.343
Phoebe, how did you know what I was
wearing and where I was running?

23:17.510 --> 23:20.930
I mean, are you like some
kind of psychic or something?

23:21.097 --> 23:23.057
Like...

23:23.224 --> 23:25.852
...only different.
- Right.

23:26.435 --> 23:31.399
That's how you've seen all these other
monsters that you mentioned, isn't it?

23:33.442 --> 23:35.987
Phoebe, you're a good person.

23:36.195 --> 23:40.074
And that probably means
you have a strong aura.

23:40.241 --> 23:44.328
Please be careful
with these monsters.

23:45.913 --> 23:49.166
Don't worry, I will.

24:05.307 --> 24:06.517
Don't worry, Billy.

24:06.725 --> 24:10.354
My mom's got a friend
who's got supernatural powers.

24:10.521 --> 24:12.940
She'll get us out of here.

24:14.733 --> 24:17.528
Shut up.

24:28.414 --> 24:30.582
Did you hear on the radio
about that philanthropist

24:30.749 --> 24:32.626
who got mysteriously strangled?

24:32.835 --> 24:34.920
It's gotta be the Grimlocks,
that's how they kill.

24:35.504 --> 24:38.632
<i>We're running out of time.
We've had, like, less than three hours.</i>

24:38.841 --> 24:42.302
<i>- Did you get the Schisandra root?
- No, but I'm leaving now to pick it.</i>

24:42.469 --> 24:45.347
Look, did Phoebe get anything
out of Brent Miller that might help us?

24:45.514 --> 24:47.766
<i>- Who's Brent Miller?
- I'm not sure.</i>

24:47.933 --> 24:49.601
<i>Prue?</i>

24:49.768 --> 24:51.311
I gotta go.

24:51.478 --> 24:53.105
Andy, hi.
What are you doing here?

24:53.272 --> 24:57.109
Working on the kidnappings.
I thought we should talk.

24:57.276 --> 25:03.073
Yeah, well, I already told the police
everything that I know about that.

25:03.240 --> 25:07.244
Not according to Eric Lohman,
you didn't. He stopped by the station.

25:07.452 --> 25:08.703
We had an interesting chat.

25:08.870 --> 25:11.706
Yeah, well, he's a reporter trying
to make a name for himself.

25:11.873 --> 25:16.461
- You can't believe anything he says.
- Normally, I don't. This time, I do.

25:17.295 --> 25:19.673
We've been down this road
too many times, Prue.

25:19.840 --> 25:23.552
I know you're hiding something.
I have my suspicions about what it is,

25:23.760 --> 25:28.348
but I've had to accept the fact
that you can't tell me,

25:28.515 --> 25:30.517
or you don't wanna tell me.

25:30.684 --> 25:32.227
Either way,
it's not just me anymore.

25:32.435 --> 25:34.813
Lohman's onto you,
or at least he thinks he is.

25:34.980 --> 25:37.399
And he's not gonna let go.

25:39.317 --> 25:42.946
Prue, if you don't level with me,
I can't help you control this.

25:43.113 --> 25:48.284
Andy, I'm just never sure if it's better
for you to know or not to know.

25:51.621 --> 25:55.333
I remember a time when we could
tell each other anything.

25:58.336 --> 26:01.172
There's nothing Lohman
won't do to get this story.

26:01.714 --> 26:03.758
Watch your back.

26:05.593 --> 26:07.637
Andy.

26:09.514 --> 26:11.391
Thanks.

26:27.824 --> 26:29.742
Bingo.

26:52.264 --> 26:55.267
- Did you get it?
- Yep, I got it.

26:55.434 --> 26:56.936
What's wrong?

26:57.103 --> 26:59.480
Andy stopped by my office
after Lohman stopped by his.

26:59.688 --> 27:01.273
I think he told Andy
about my powers.

27:02.316 --> 27:04.610
- What did you do?
- Same as I always do,

27:04.777 --> 27:08.572
I danced around the truth.
It just doesn't feel right anymore.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.784
Oh, my God.

27:16.121 --> 27:17.998
Where is the mother?

27:18.374 --> 27:20.501
Oh, thank God.

27:20.668 --> 27:23.587
Wait a second. Since when did
the Johnsons get a baby?

27:23.796 --> 27:27.675
That damn reporter. Look.

27:27.883 --> 27:31.720
- Okay, confused.
- That's Lohman. This is a setup.

27:31.887 --> 27:35.891
We need to get back to where we were
before everything unfreezes. Go.

27:37.893 --> 27:41.605
Don't forget to put
your hands up. Okay.

27:45.692 --> 27:49.947
Don't look, just go inside.
Inside. Go, go.

28:20.894 --> 28:23.772
Purse on right shoulder,
purse on left shoulder.

28:28.235 --> 28:30.111
Purse on right shoulder.

28:31.571 --> 28:32.989
Purse on left shoulder.

28:33.156 --> 28:35.742
What do you know.
She has another power.

28:35.951 --> 28:37.786
Gotcha.

28:40.497 --> 28:42.415
Gotcha.

29:00.725 --> 29:04.437
- Is he still out there?
- Unfortunately.

29:04.604 --> 29:08.233
Hey, you guys, I think I found
the entrance to the storm drain.

29:08.858 --> 29:10.985
- What's going on?
- Didn't you see that guy

29:11.152 --> 29:12.779
- parked out front in his car?
- Yes.

29:12.946 --> 29:14.989
Yeah, well, that's the reporter
I told you about.

29:15.156 --> 29:17.033
- He's staking us out.
- What?

29:17.200 --> 29:19.619
He tricked us into using our powers
and nearly caught us.

29:19.827 --> 29:22.080
But fortunately, we figured out
what he was doing

29:22.246 --> 29:24.999
- before he could get any proof.
- Oh, thank God.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.460
The only problem is,
how are we gonna be out looking

29:27.627 --> 29:31.547
when he's camped outside?
We have less than two hours.

29:39.388 --> 29:41.182
Hey, how's it going?

29:41.349 --> 29:44.268
Mind if I use your bathroom?
Don't bother using

29:44.435 --> 29:47.355
your magical powers on me.
I already hid the videotape.

29:47.563 --> 29:49.565
- What videotape?
- Yeah.

29:49.732 --> 29:53.527
You know, best I can guess
is somehow one of you stopped time

29:53.945 --> 29:55.363
or rewound it, I don't know.

29:55.571 --> 29:58.324
But, what I do know
is I've got the whole thing on tape.

29:58.532 --> 29:59.992
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

30:00.201 --> 30:02.703
How do you explain your
sister's purse magically jumping

30:02.870 --> 30:06.999
from her right shoulder
to her left shoulder instantaneously?

30:07.166 --> 30:10.044
You screwed up, and I got the proof.

30:11.003 --> 30:12.546
Okay, now, here's the deal.

30:12.713 --> 30:14.548
I already got my story ready to print.

30:14.715 --> 30:18.427
But what I really want now from you
is a tell-all exclusive.

30:18.886 --> 30:21.889
All right? I'll write the book,
we can share in the movie rights,

30:22.097 --> 30:24.183
- foreign sales, distribution...
- Get out.

30:24.391 --> 30:26.227
It'd be a good thing.

30:26.393 --> 30:30.189
All right. Okay. I'll just wait
out front until you're ready to talk.

30:30.397 --> 30:32.191
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, look,

30:32.399 --> 30:36.570
I will stay here and finish the potions.
You guys go try and find the boys.

30:36.779 --> 30:39.698
Buy us some time.
Keep on freezing those Grimlocks

30:39.865 --> 30:41.658
- until I get there.
- What about Lohman?

30:41.825 --> 30:45.079
Don't worry about him.
I'll stop him from following you.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.834
Lohman,

30:51.376 --> 30:53.670
I've been thinking
about what you said

30:53.837 --> 30:55.297
and maybe we can work
something out.

30:55.506 --> 30:58.133
Yeah? Why don't I believe you?

30:58.508 --> 31:02.429
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's just
your reporter instincts.

31:07.476 --> 31:09.561
- Busted.
- Nice try.

31:15.734 --> 31:18.403
You did that, didn't you?
I know you did that.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.655
Really? Prove it.

31:35.045 --> 31:38.173
I'm not wearing
the right shoes for this.

31:40.425 --> 31:44.179
Okay, talk about all roads
leading to hell.

31:44.346 --> 31:46.514
Which way?

31:47.766 --> 31:50.060
- Light, light.
- All right.

31:52.062 --> 31:56.483
Brent said he remembered
a big area with pipes.

31:57.484 --> 31:59.778
Oh, wait. There's a pipe juncture...

32:01.905 --> 32:04.115
...that way. Okay.

32:06.951 --> 32:11.247
So I guess this isn't a good time to ask
how it went with Josh and the talk.

32:11.414 --> 32:15.335
- You're right, it's not.
- Okay.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.549
Inspector Trudeau?

32:21.716 --> 32:25.678
- Yes, Mr Miller.
- You wanted to talk to me.

32:25.845 --> 32:28.056
- Is it about the kidnappings?
- Maybe.

32:28.222 --> 32:31.768
Has a Prue Halliwell come
to talk to you by any chance?

32:31.934 --> 32:33.394
No.

32:33.561 --> 32:36.522
But I have spoken
to a Phoebe Halliwell.

32:36.731 --> 32:38.816
Really?

32:39.025 --> 32:42.528
I think I know where she went
if that will help you.

32:48.326 --> 32:50.411
Who knew anything
could smell so bad.

32:50.578 --> 32:53.664
- Now there's a good sign.
- Meaning?

32:53.831 --> 32:56.751
I saw it in a vision
that I had of Brent.

33:02.923 --> 33:05.551
Piper! Piper!

33:06.260 --> 33:08.346
Piper, are you okay?

33:09.472 --> 33:12.850
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

33:14.643 --> 33:16.103
Piper, I'll get help.

33:22.610 --> 33:25.279
I feel like I should be cackling.

33:32.661 --> 33:34.747
- Hello.
- Prue.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.874
Piper's hurt. And I can't get to her.

33:37.082 --> 33:39.627
- Okay, where are you?
- At the end of Varick street.

33:39.793 --> 33:41.712
Hurry, okay?
And don't forget the potion.

33:41.879 --> 33:44.381
I'm on my way.

33:58.228 --> 34:00.606
Didn't want you to leave me behind
like your sisters did.

34:01.064 --> 34:02.983
- Fix it now.
- Or what?

34:03.150 --> 34:05.944
You gonna hurt me? Go ahead.
Just let me get you in focus.

34:06.153 --> 34:08.405
- Okay.
- I don't have time for this, all right.

34:08.572 --> 34:10.949
Piper is hurt, and
two boys' lives are at stake.

34:11.324 --> 34:13.243
- Do you know where they are?
- Yes.

34:15.286 --> 34:19.166
- All right, you win.
- I win? What's my prize?

34:22.918 --> 34:25.005
I'm a witch with magical powers.

34:25.464 --> 34:29.384
A witch? A witch? This is great.

34:29.551 --> 34:31.178
Great. Terrific, let's go.

34:46.525 --> 34:48.695
- What is he doing here?
- Making my career.

34:48.862 --> 34:50.405
I didn't have a choice.
Where's Piper?

34:50.614 --> 34:53.616
- She's in through this way. Come on.
- Stay here. It's too dangerous.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.618
- No, no, no, I'm coming with you.
- No.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.288
There are too many lives at stake,
including my sister's.

34:58.455 --> 35:01.499
I will not have you risking them.
Stay. You'll get your story.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.626
Okay, all right. I'll just wait out here.

35:11.551 --> 35:14.345
Phoebe, is that you?

35:19.184 --> 35:21.060
Phoebe.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.483
Prue!

35:34.324 --> 35:36.451
Nice.

36:01.976 --> 36:04.186
This is Eric Lohman, reporting live.

36:04.937 --> 36:07.481
I'm in a storm drain underground,

36:07.648 --> 36:10.609
following three sisters,
all of them witches,

36:10.818 --> 36:14.780
as they look for children
who may have been abducted

36:14.947 --> 36:18.075
by a strange kind of...

36:29.503 --> 36:31.380
Okay.

36:32.673 --> 36:35.509
- We've got to get you out of here.
- No, no.

36:35.676 --> 36:38.095
Look, Piper,
just up to the street, okay?

36:38.262 --> 36:40.848
Phoebe and I will
come right back for the boys.

36:41.015 --> 36:43.684
Come on, lean on me, honey.

37:02.411 --> 37:04.037
Don't move.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.794
Andy!

37:17.801 --> 37:21.972
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

37:25.851 --> 37:28.895
So, what Lohman
saw you do is true.

37:31.314 --> 37:36.111
- Andy, what are you doing here?
- Confirming my suspicions.

37:36.319 --> 37:38.196
He knows.

37:38.405 --> 37:39.865
A Grimlock tried to kill him.

37:40.073 --> 37:42.742
- What the hell is a Grimlock?
- It's a demon.

37:43.910 --> 37:45.871
- A demon.
- Yeah.

37:46.079 --> 37:48.456
Look, Andy, I need you to get
Piper up on the street, okay?

37:48.915 --> 37:54.296
- No, I wanna stay. I need to help.
- You're too weak to use your powers.

37:54.462 --> 37:55.755
Her too?

37:55.922 --> 37:59.592
- Will you please get her out of here?
- Prue, I'm not leaving

37:59.759 --> 38:02.470
- the two of you alone.
- Do I have to use my power on you?

38:03.221 --> 38:05.640
I'll meet you up on the street.

38:07.559 --> 38:09.102
You'll be okay.

38:26.077 --> 38:29.872
Okay, we should be coming up
on a feeder drain right about now.

38:46.681 --> 38:51.102
Great, just what we need,
more toxic waste in our sewers.

38:51.269 --> 38:53.980
- That worked well.
- Yeah.

38:57.692 --> 38:59.861
David?

39:04.240 --> 39:07.285
- David?
- Please help me.

39:08.452 --> 39:10.371
David.

39:10.830 --> 39:13.708
Oh, God. Prue, I found them!

39:50.494 --> 39:52.579
- You okay?
- Are you okay?

39:52.746 --> 39:55.958
- Yeah, where's David?
- Over there.

40:05.884 --> 40:07.970
I can see!

40:08.762 --> 40:10.180
I can see you!

40:10.389 --> 40:13.308
I knew you had magic powers.

40:17.688 --> 40:19.898
Come on, get your friend.
Let's get out of here, okay?

40:28.156 --> 40:32.536
Exactly how did you know
the kids were down there again?

40:33.161 --> 40:36.164
- Anonymous tip.
- What about the kidnappers?

40:36.873 --> 40:38.542
Kidnappers?
There weren't any kidnappers.

40:38.750 --> 40:40.961
Kids followed a kitten
into the storm drain.

40:41.169 --> 40:42.671
- Got lost.
- Really?

40:43.171 --> 40:47.175
How do you explain finding Lohman
down there with a broken neck?

40:47.342 --> 40:50.095
Must have slipped when he went
down there after them.

40:50.262 --> 40:52.806
Anything for a story. It's too bad.

40:53.014 --> 40:55.809
Yeah, it's a real shame.

40:58.061 --> 41:01.856
You don't really expect me
to believe all this, do you?

41:02.816 --> 41:04.484
For now.

41:14.869 --> 41:16.079
Have they said anything?

41:16.246 --> 41:17.705
No, just got back
from the hospital.

41:17.872 --> 41:20.375
But who knows what they'll say
once the police question them.

41:20.542 --> 41:22.919
So much for our secret.

41:24.379 --> 41:26.214
Hey, you okay?

41:26.381 --> 41:29.300
Yeah, I was just thinking.

41:29.509 --> 41:32.387
When I was in the storm drain
I was kind of out of it

41:32.554 --> 41:35.598
and I kept thinking about Leo.
That's weird.

41:36.057 --> 41:38.893
- Maybe you miss him.
- Maybe.

41:39.102 --> 41:41.771
What are you gonna do
about Josh?

41:43.147 --> 41:46.943
I'm gonna call him and tell him
I think he should take that job.

41:47.110 --> 41:50.488
Sweetie, you can't hold out for Leo.
Who knows if he's gonna come back.

41:50.905 --> 41:53.950
I know, he may not.
But if I'm thinking about Leo,

41:54.117 --> 41:56.494
then I'm definitely
not thinking about Josh.

42:00.456 --> 42:03.793
That's too bad,
he had really nice glutes.

42:07.296 --> 42:09.632
Hey, there's Brent. Hey, Brent!

42:11.926 --> 42:14.011
Over here.

42:15.346 --> 42:16.806
Hi.

42:16.973 --> 42:19.558
- Hi.
- Where's your dog?

42:20.142 --> 42:22.353
He's retired.

42:24.146 --> 42:27.441
You can see? But how did that...?

42:27.608 --> 42:29.860
I don't know. I mean, you tell me.

42:30.027 --> 42:31.612
Someone must've
slayed those monsters.

42:31.779 --> 42:36.242
- Do you know anything about it?
- Oh, I...

42:37.368 --> 42:38.911
It's all right. I mean,

42:39.078 --> 42:43.207
if anyone understands the danger
of telling amazing stories, I sure do.

42:44.166 --> 42:47.253
I was right. You do have
a beautiful smile.

42:49.505 --> 42:51.090
- Are those the boys?
- Yeah.

42:51.257 --> 42:55.844
- Maybe I should have a talk with them.
- That would be so great. Thank you.

42:56.053 --> 42:58.097
No, thank you.

43:11.110 --> 43:13.403
So now you know.

43:13.612 --> 43:16.657
Yeah, although it's still sinking in.

43:16.865 --> 43:19.243
Where do we go from here?

43:19.409 --> 43:20.452
That's a good question.

43:20.619 --> 43:23.539
Inspector Trudeau, is this related
to the one 20 years ago?

43:23.705 --> 43:26.166
Inspector,
what's your official position?

43:26.917 --> 43:29.878
Inspector. Inspector, please.
We need to know...
