02:37.591 --> 02:42.862
Coming up next, I want you to give
a warm welcome to DJ Phantom.

02:45.167 --> 02:46.533
I'm really proud of you, mate.

02:46.535 --> 02:48.535
Great set Mister Oakenfold.
Thank you, man.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.806
Let's rock this house, phantom.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.414
That's my boy.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.683
Come on.

03:19.501 --> 03:22.569
Loser! Loser!

03:22.571 --> 03:24.837
Not now, come on.
No, no, no, no, no.

03:24.839 --> 03:26.272
Shit.

03:26.274 --> 03:29.742
- Logan.
- Mom, no, you can't.

03:29.744 --> 03:31.911
I was in the middle of a mix.

03:31.913 --> 03:34.214
Is knocking asking for too much?

03:34.216 --> 03:36.382
Oh, I did knock,
and so did your father.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.219
Good luck hearing anything
over that.

03:39.221 --> 03:40.687
When are you going to stop
wasting your time

03:40.689 --> 03:43.389
with all this DJ stuff?

03:43.391 --> 03:44.924
Just so you know, this DJ stuff

03:44.926 --> 03:46.526
could make me a lot of money,

03:46.528 --> 03:48.528
if that's what
you're worried about.

03:48.530 --> 03:51.231
Just like my Tupperware parties.

03:51.233 --> 03:52.865
You can make
$15,000 dollars a night.

03:52.867 --> 03:56.569
Stanford does not offer
a Major in Dee-Jaying.

03:56.571 --> 03:58.404
Is there a reason
you're up here,

03:58.406 --> 04:00.907
or are you just up here to crush
all my hopes and dreams?

04:00.909 --> 04:02.542
Honey, your father wants to know

04:02.544 --> 04:05.545
if you were anywhere
near his car.

04:05.547 --> 04:09.849
- No.
- Was Blake?

04:12.720 --> 04:16.255
Logan, stay away
from the Porsche

04:16.257 --> 04:17.790
or your father will kill you.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.427
He's funny about his car.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.496
I'd like you
to keep your room cleaner.

04:23.498 --> 04:24.764
- Yeah.
- And you know,

04:24.766 --> 04:27.267
I'm noticing these nudie photos.

04:27.269 --> 04:28.901
Is Blake putting those up?

04:28.903 --> 04:30.536
Yeah, mom.
It's all Blake.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.540
I used to look like that.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.748
No. No. No. No.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.450
Logan, my website needs
production value.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.352
You need to lose your virginity.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.920
We need this car.

04:47.922 --> 04:49.022
Dude, don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

04:49.024 --> 04:50.923
My dad will kill us.

04:50.925 --> 04:52.759
She's not going to care
if I show up in a Porsche.

04:52.761 --> 04:54.761
Seriously, Blake.
Fucking stop.

04:54.763 --> 04:56.596
Seriously, dude, fucking stop.

04:56.598 --> 04:58.765
Okay, relax.
Relax, okay? Relax.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.600
Take it easy, all right?
Take a deep breath.

05:00.602 --> 05:05.004
Close your eyes. Imagine
you and Lina in this car.

05:05.006 --> 05:06.839
There's wind blowing
through her hair.

05:06.841 --> 05:09.609
Her hand is on your gearshift.

05:09.611 --> 05:11.544
Music is blaring
through the sub-woofers.

05:16.551 --> 05:18.318
I have been making her a mix.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.454
Of course you have.
And you know why?

05:21.456 --> 05:26.592
So you can play it for her
in this car tonight.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.428
You show off
your bad-ass DJ skills.

05:28.430 --> 05:29.629
"Wiki-wiki!"

05:29.631 --> 05:32.498
Spin her around,
DJ all over her vagina.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.467
A little Booty action.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.641
No.

05:41.643 --> 05:43.810
Logan, we have been best
friends since pre-school.

05:43.812 --> 05:45.645
Original juice box buddies.

05:45.647 --> 05:48.348
I know how big your penis is
through your basketball shorts.

05:48.350 --> 05:49.816
I could sketch it
like a mug shot.

05:49.818 --> 05:52.085
Have I ever misguided you?

05:52.087 --> 05:56.889
This is fate.
Don't pussy out now.

06:05.934 --> 06:07.767
Man on TV: Do you want to
regain your male power back?

06:07.769 --> 06:10.002
We have the answer for you.
Clinically validated,

06:10.004 --> 06:12.672
universally acclaimed
Erectus Supplimentus.

06:12.674 --> 06:14.540
Call now,
1-800-Erectus.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.709
First hundred callers
get 50 percent off.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.813
Whoo!

06:22.816 --> 06:25.618
Lina. Stephanie.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.854
- Both: Hey.
- What a surprise.

06:27.856 --> 06:28.855
I didn't think
you guys were coming.

06:28.857 --> 06:30.590
Hey, wanna smoke some weed?

06:30.592 --> 06:32.925
How about some California gold?

06:32.927 --> 06:34.861
- Oh, my god.
- That's just for you.

06:34.863 --> 06:37.997
- This is awesome.
- I've got one for you, too.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.936
Whoa, is that Logan?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.777
Eugene, film this.
Film this, film this.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.580
Ooh!

06:54.582 --> 06:56.649
Dude, that's not funny.
That's not funny.

06:56.651 --> 06:58.985
That's not funny.
Don't do that.

06:58.987 --> 07:00.553
Dude, dude!
Mission accomplished.

07:00.555 --> 07:01.888
Mission accomplished.
Look to your right!

07:01.890 --> 07:03.956
Logan, where'd
you get the Porsche?

07:03.958 --> 07:05.892
Yeah, the mission was to get
Lina to notice you

07:05.894 --> 07:07.727
and she's looking right at you.

07:07.729 --> 07:09.695
She wants you.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.130
Go in there and go talk to her.

07:11.132 --> 07:13.900
- Let's go inside.
- Go.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.805
I'm going to do it.
Tonight's the night.

07:18.807 --> 07:20.606
Yeah.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.808
Watch the car, Blake.

07:21.810 --> 07:23.743
I will not take
my eyes off of it.

07:23.745 --> 07:25.511
- You watch the car, Blake.
- Stop talking to me.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.746
Go talk to her.
Eugene, did you get that?

07:26.748 --> 07:28.748
- Yes, I got it all.
- Yes!

07:28.750 --> 07:31.083
Boys: Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink!

07:31.085 --> 07:35.221
Yeah!

07:35.223 --> 07:37.623
Oh, my god.
High school parties.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.460
I can't wait for spring break.
It's going to be so cool.

07:40.462 --> 07:42.929
Please, to do anything
seriously fun,

07:42.931 --> 07:46.098
we have to get out of the United
States of can't do anything.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.100
You and ash are really going
to go to Puerto Vallarta?

07:48.102 --> 07:50.837
Yes, and so should you.
It's gonna be so much fun.

07:50.839 --> 07:54.106
Better boys.
Better booze. Better music.

07:54.108 --> 07:56.776
I mean, what is this shit?
I can't even dance to it.

07:56.778 --> 08:00.112
Lina: I know.
Let's get out of here.

08:00.114 --> 08:03.082
Hey. What's up?
Puerto Vallarta, huh?

08:03.084 --> 08:06.052
That's cool.
That's Mexico, right?

08:06.054 --> 08:07.854
- Have you ever been?
- No.

08:07.856 --> 08:11.824
Oh, my gosh.
It is so much fun.

08:11.826 --> 08:13.259
You should totally come with us.
It's going to be epic.

08:13.261 --> 08:15.127
- Boys: Drink, drink, drink!
- Really?

08:15.129 --> 08:16.963
Oh, my god. This party
officially sucks.

08:16.965 --> 08:18.898
Can we please just get
to the college party?

08:18.900 --> 08:21.801
Oh, yes. Please!

08:21.803 --> 08:24.704
Oh, Logan,
would you mind driving us?

08:24.706 --> 08:27.540
Yeah. Yeah, no, that's...

08:27.542 --> 08:28.708
yeah, I can do that.
That's cool.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.710
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.

08:30.712 --> 08:32.144
You're so sweet.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.515
Gentle. Gentle. Oh!

08:36.518 --> 08:38.284
Just throw him over, huh?

08:38.285 --> 08:40.686
Oh, yeah. Shots! Shots!

08:40.688 --> 08:42.688
Hey, just excuse me one second.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.824
Blake! Blake! I told you
to watch the car.

08:44.826 --> 08:46.259
I have not taken
my eyes off of it.

08:46.261 --> 08:47.827
Just get them off.

08:47.829 --> 08:49.161
I'm driving Lina
to another party.

08:49.163 --> 08:52.265
Yes! Okay. Hold this.

08:52.267 --> 08:54.534
Ladies, Eugene,
you guys are done.

08:54.536 --> 08:56.936
- Just a sec.
- Super virgin coming through.

08:56.938 --> 08:59.939
Thank you very much. Eugene, you are done.
Get out of here.

08:59.941 --> 09:02.174
- Girl: Jeez.
- Oh, god.

09:02.176 --> 09:05.177
I'm so sorry.
It was those shrimp tacos.

09:05.179 --> 09:07.013
You know what?
It's fine.

09:07.015 --> 09:08.614
Don't worry about it.
We'll get another ride.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.716
No. No, no, no, no.
This is fine.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.285
I can clean this up...

09:12.287 --> 09:14.887
it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

09:14.889 --> 09:17.590
- Oh, hey, Josh! Can I get a ride?
- Sure, jump in.

09:17.592 --> 09:19.926
- Are you going to the frat party?
- Of course.

09:19.928 --> 09:21.994
- Bye!
- Thanks anyway, Logan!

09:26.033 --> 09:27.867
I'll get us some paper towels.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.774
I was actually going to give
her a ride... in the Porsche.

09:34.776 --> 09:36.208
Let's turn it up.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.578
Dude, if my dad wakes up,
he'll kill us.

09:38.580 --> 09:40.246
Jesus, you're pussy.

09:40.248 --> 09:42.048
You like saying
that word too much.

09:42.050 --> 09:44.917
Well, that's because it takes
away the power. Pussy.

09:44.919 --> 09:47.753
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy,
pussy, pussy, pussy!

09:47.755 --> 09:49.589
I just want to touch
her pussy! Pussy!

09:49.591 --> 09:52.058
- Oh, shit. I've got to back it in.
- Pussy, pussy!

09:52.060 --> 09:54.760
Oh, fuck.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.729
Dude, this is so not my fault.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.210
- What were you thinking?
- I'm sorry.

10:11.212 --> 10:13.779
Damn right, you're sorry,
because you are grounded.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.015
- No spring break.
- Mom, no, no, no.

10:16.017 --> 10:17.917
Blake and I have been planning
this trip for almost a year.

10:17.919 --> 10:19.251
Then you should
have thought about that

10:19.253 --> 10:21.153
before you stole
your father's car.

10:21.155 --> 10:24.624
The cruise tickets
are non-refundable.

10:24.626 --> 10:25.925
I've been saving up
a lot of money.

10:25.927 --> 10:27.660
We can't let that go to waste.

10:27.662 --> 10:30.930
Well, you're right.

10:30.932 --> 10:35.768
We're not a wasteful family.
We recycle.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.940
Which is why...

10:40.942 --> 10:44.043
We're going to let you
house-sit for a week.

10:44.045 --> 10:46.946
- Huh?
- House sit?

10:46.948 --> 10:49.849
Where are you two going?

10:49.851 --> 10:51.283
Listen, your mom wants us
to pay you back

10:51.285 --> 10:52.952
for those cruise tickets,

10:52.954 --> 10:54.220
so here's what's left

10:54.222 --> 10:57.323
after the cleaning costs
on the Porsche.

10:57.325 --> 11:00.726
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.129
Your mom also thinks that
I should give you a chance

11:03.131 --> 11:06.332
to earn back my trust,
so have a seat.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.972
Logan, your grandfather
was a great man.

11:12.974 --> 11:15.207
He was kind, and he was honest,

11:15.209 --> 11:16.742
and totally trustworthy.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.945
And those qualities
so impressed his father

11:19.947 --> 11:22.948
that he was given
a beautiful Rolex watch.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.984
And when he thought
that I demonstrated

11:24.986 --> 11:29.155
those qualities of trust
and responsibility,

11:29.157 --> 11:30.823
he gave the Rolex to me.

11:30.825 --> 11:32.692
Problem is,

11:32.694 --> 11:33.693
I don't think
you've demonstrated

11:33.695 --> 11:37.096
those qualities at all.

11:37.098 --> 11:41.701
But the Rolex
is at the jewelers.

11:41.703 --> 11:43.169
It's being cleaned.

11:43.171 --> 11:44.270
I'm not giving it to you.

11:44.272 --> 11:46.272
I just want you to pick it up.

11:46.274 --> 11:47.440
Really?

11:47.442 --> 11:49.341
You think you can handle that?

11:49.343 --> 11:50.910
Of course, dad. Yeah.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.016
I can handle it.
I promise.

11:57.018 --> 11:58.350
Now, we'll be back Sunday.

11:58.352 --> 12:00.186
I don't want Blake coming over,

12:00.188 --> 12:02.354
and here is a to-do list.

12:02.356 --> 12:03.889
I want every one of these done.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.891
Janis,
I think that's a bad idea.

12:05.893 --> 12:09.361
Kent, we discussed this
trust exercise.

12:09.363 --> 12:10.896
Logan gets to show us

12:10.898 --> 12:13.232
that he can be
a responsible young man.

12:13.234 --> 12:15.334
- I'm going to miss you.
- Okay.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.739
- This is really happening?
- Why talk to a closed door?

12:19.741 --> 12:24.043
- You're taking my tickets?
- Go inside and start the list.

12:24.045 --> 12:26.879
Take care of that watch.

12:26.881 --> 12:29.749
I can't believe they took
our cruise tickets.

12:29.751 --> 12:31.751
Yeah, well, at least
they paid us back.

12:31.753 --> 12:33.919
But that was our spring break.

12:33.921 --> 12:37.123
We should be the ones frolicking
naked on deck, not your parents.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.258
Need you to sign
right here, Logan.

12:39.260 --> 12:41.260
Yes, sir.

12:41.262 --> 12:42.795
Blake:
Sweet timepiece.

12:42.797 --> 12:45.097
1962 Rolex submariner.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.899
Total chick magnet.

12:46.901 --> 12:48.234
Can you please tell him
that no watch

12:48.236 --> 12:50.069
is going to get a guy
a girl? Come on.

12:50.071 --> 12:52.371
Why do you think I do this?
Honey?

12:52.373 --> 12:56.809
- Could you deposit this?
- Okay.

12:56.811 --> 12:59.779
- Who's that?
- My girlfriend.

12:59.781 --> 13:01.514
Woman: Willie, babe.
It's for you.

13:01.516 --> 13:04.450
Excuse me, guys.

13:04.452 --> 13:07.186
- Put it on.
- No.

13:07.188 --> 13:08.854
Just put it on.
What can it hurt?

13:08.856 --> 13:11.290
Fine.
I'm putting on the watch.

13:11.292 --> 13:14.426
- You happy? Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

13:14.428 --> 13:18.097
Lina would love that.
We should go show it to her.

13:18.099 --> 13:19.465
Yeah, let's go all the way

13:19.467 --> 13:21.567
down to Puerto Vallarta
to show Lina a watch.

13:21.569 --> 13:25.104
Mexico?
Dude, that's brilliant.

13:25.106 --> 13:26.438
That's way better than a cruise.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.208
Puerto Vallarta
is a romantic paradise.

13:29.210 --> 13:31.443
How many years have you been
trying to get with Lina,

13:31.445 --> 13:34.313
and suddenly this just
falls into your lap?

13:34.315 --> 13:36.115
Dude, we have the funds.

13:36.117 --> 13:38.117
Lina practically
gave you the invite.

13:38.119 --> 13:40.186
This is fate, my friend.

13:40.188 --> 13:43.489
Fate? Remember you said that the
other night? Look what happened.

13:43.491 --> 13:45.457
That's because fate had
something else for you in mind.

13:45.459 --> 13:46.926
Fate had this.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.099
Lina would look amazing
in that dusky Mexican light.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.268
Yes! Yes. I'll book us
a package online.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.004
- I still have that whole to-do list.
- It's a to-do list.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.307
We'll get it done
in a couple of hours, tops.

14:01.309 --> 14:03.542
Dude, if we don't do this,

14:03.544 --> 14:06.612
we will regret it
for the rest of our lives.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.606
Whoo. Hola, Mamacitas!
Can I meet your parents?

14:33.608 --> 14:35.040
I just want to
congratulate them.

14:35.042 --> 14:39.211
- Girl: Losers.
- Oh, my god.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.280
Logan: That's your way
to break the ice, Romeo?

14:41.282 --> 14:43.048
Blake: Dude, girls love it when
you talk dirty. It's perfect.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.184
Sex is not polite.
It's sloppy, it's dirty.

14:45.186 --> 14:47.186
- Yeah, okay. You're an idiot.
- Lose the negativity.

14:47.188 --> 14:49.188
We are on spring break.

14:49.190 --> 14:51.357
You should take
a little lesson from me.

14:51.359 --> 14:53.459
Logan:
Okay, that was pretty good.

14:53.461 --> 14:55.895
Okay.

14:55.897 --> 14:57.563
I don't know
which one to choose.

14:57.565 --> 15:01.066
I mean, do we just
pick one random?

15:01.068 --> 15:06.538
Hey, guys! Are you Logan and Blake?
Yeah? You are?

15:06.540 --> 15:09.375
Yeah, we are.
Um, who are you?

15:09.377 --> 15:11.911
The hotel sent me to pick you up

15:11.913 --> 15:14.546
come on, come on.
Come on, come on!

15:20.922 --> 15:23.222
You are very special guests, eh?

15:23.224 --> 15:25.925
Special guests?
What did you do?

15:25.927 --> 15:27.226
Got us a really bitching tour.

15:27.228 --> 15:29.561
Come in, come in!
Come in.

15:29.563 --> 15:31.497
Blake:
I hooked us up, baby!

15:31.499 --> 15:35.234
Welcome to Mexico, guys!
Welcome.

15:35.236 --> 15:39.972
Amigos, my name is Chuy.
Where can I take you?

15:39.974 --> 15:42.074
I though you said
the hotel sent you.

15:42.076 --> 15:45.411
No. Not really.
You needed a taxi, no?

15:45.413 --> 15:49.949
- Chuy to the rescue.
- How did you know our names?

15:49.951 --> 15:51.951
Because Chuy knows everything

15:51.953 --> 15:56.956
in Puerto Vallarta.

15:56.958 --> 16:00.225
- Fiesta Americana.
- Let's go.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.962
How did you know our names?
I still don't understand.

16:02.964 --> 16:06.165
This guy's a Mexican Jedi.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.607
This is Vallarta!

16:18.145 --> 16:20.279
Land of the beautiful beaches.

16:20.281 --> 16:22.314
So, what brings you here,
amigos?

16:22.316 --> 16:26.051
I'm here for material
for my website, blakejob.com

16:26.053 --> 16:28.420
I want to film
some quality Booty.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.155
What about you, Guerito?

16:30.157 --> 16:33.459
He's here for his dream girl.
Her name is Lina.

16:33.461 --> 16:36.295
- She's all right.
- Chuy: Lina. Huh.

16:38.199 --> 16:40.733
Watch out! Oh, shit!

16:43.037 --> 16:45.137
- Oh!
- Look, look!

16:45.139 --> 16:50.376
Hey! Ladies! Smile!

16:50.378 --> 16:53.746
Hey, they're my cousins.

16:53.748 --> 16:58.784
Yeah, your fucking cousin,
my ass.

17:00.321 --> 17:02.287
Chuy:
So, you came to see a girl.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.123
Logan:
Yeah. It's a special girl.

17:04.125 --> 17:08.660
Oh! Here we have
many special girls, amigo.

17:20.073 --> 17:24.309
- Hold on, guys.
- Whoa!

17:29.717 --> 17:33.519
- Oh!
- Blake: Oh, shit.

17:33.521 --> 17:35.721
We have arrived.

17:35.723 --> 17:40.225
Okay, that would be
fifty dollars, guy.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.693
- Fifty dollars?
- Yeah.

17:41.695 --> 17:44.363
No way, man.

17:44.365 --> 17:47.366
Okay, twenty, all right?
Okay, fine.

17:47.368 --> 17:50.069
But Chuy make you deal, huh?

17:50.071 --> 17:55.340
I drive you all week
for only $200.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.076
- $200?
- Yeah.

17:57.078 --> 17:58.310
No, that's too much money.

17:58.312 --> 18:01.680
Not for you, right,
mister Rolex?

18:01.682 --> 18:04.249
This isn't mine.
It's my dad's.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.751
I'm just keeping it safe.

18:05.753 --> 18:08.787
No problem, amigos.
No problem.

18:08.789 --> 18:14.226
Just remember, you want
anything, you ask Chuy.

18:14.228 --> 18:16.662
I get for you 24-7.

18:16.664 --> 18:18.630
Anything at all, okay?
Anything at all.

18:18.632 --> 18:20.532
Call me. Call me.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.568
Blake: Look at this shit.
This is heaven.

18:22.570 --> 18:23.735
Wow.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.711
Blake:
What? They're everywhere.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.552
Come on, can we at least
get our room first?

18:40.554 --> 18:41.753
Later!

18:44.591 --> 18:48.360
Welcome to Puerto Vallarta.

18:48.362 --> 18:50.762
Emcee: Are you ready
for the bikini contest?

18:50.764 --> 18:52.431
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico,
spring break!

18:52.433 --> 18:54.867
Let me hear you make some noise!

18:54.869 --> 18:56.768

18:56.770 --> 18:58.504
Oh, my god, look at that...

18:58.506 --> 19:01.340

That is amazing.

19:01.342 --> 19:03.142
Give it up for number seven.

19:03.144 --> 19:05.611
Oh, yeah, baby. Shake it,
shake it, shake it.

19:05.613 --> 19:08.514
Check out those curves.

19:08.516 --> 19:10.449
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

19:10.451 --> 19:14.453
We've got more girls coming.
More girls coming up.

19:14.455 --> 19:17.823
That's right, now we have
contestant number eight.

19:17.825 --> 19:19.625
Oh, I hate my job.

19:19.627 --> 19:21.326
Our final contestant,

19:21.328 --> 19:23.729
all the way from Miami beach,
number nine.

19:23.731 --> 19:26.231

19:33.641 --> 19:35.707

19:37.745 --> 19:39.344
Emcee: Oh, my god.
Take it off, lades!

19:39.346 --> 19:43.348
What happens in Mexico,
stays in Mexico!

19:43.350 --> 19:45.651
I'm home. I'm home.

19:45.653 --> 19:48.720
Spring break, let me
hear you make some noise!

19:55.562 --> 19:57.663
Check this out.

19:57.665 --> 19:59.865
- Eh? Eh?
- Mmm. Mmm.

19:59.867 --> 20:02.901
And... she's here.

20:02.903 --> 20:04.836
And the blakejob knows
where she's going tonight.

20:04.838 --> 20:07.239
Can you say foam party?

20:07.241 --> 20:09.441
Donde Esta foam party?

20:09.443 --> 20:12.511
- We don't have a room.
- What? How can that be?

20:12.513 --> 20:16.215
- I got us a package online.
- Did you?

20:16.217 --> 20:18.383
Watch and learn, Logan.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.719
Watch and learn.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.387
Excuse me.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.523
There must have been
some kind of mistake.

20:24.525 --> 20:26.959
This is our email confirmation.

20:26.961 --> 20:29.661
As you can see, totally
bitchin tours doesn't exist.

20:29.663 --> 20:33.398
I believe you've been scammed.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.235
Can you just double-check
that for us?

20:36.237 --> 20:38.770
I've checked twice already.

20:38.772 --> 20:40.505
Miss, we are not going anywhere.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.940
So unless you want

20:41.942 --> 20:44.409
to cause a scene
of thorough unpleasantness...

20:44.411 --> 20:47.713

20:47.715 --> 20:49.248
Stop it. Stop it.

20:49.250 --> 20:50.616
One star yelp review.

20:50.618 --> 20:53.518
I suggest you lower your voice.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.987
Well, I suggest
that you get somebody

20:54.989 --> 20:58.523
to show us to our room now
or I will vomit!

20:58.525 --> 21:00.559
You can't throw us out,
we're Americans!

21:00.561 --> 21:01.760
Americano! Americano!

21:01.762 --> 21:03.428

- Fuck.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.565

- Ah, fuck.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.567
"If we don't do this,
we'll regret this

21:08.569 --> 21:10.335
for the rest of our lives."

21:10.337 --> 21:12.337
"This is fate testing you."

21:12.339 --> 21:14.406
How could I be
so stupid? Fuck.

21:16.743 --> 21:17.943
We'll find another hotel, okay?

21:17.945 --> 21:19.678
How are we going to pay for it?

21:21.581 --> 21:22.848
Maybe we could stay with Lina.

21:22.850 --> 21:24.416
Yeah. "Hi, Lina.

21:24.418 --> 21:25.651
I stalked you
all the way to Mexico.

21:25.653 --> 21:26.718
I don't have a room.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.287
Can Blake and I
stay with you?"

21:28.289 --> 21:29.488
What else do you want
to do, dude?

21:29.490 --> 21:31.490
You want to sleep on the beach?

21:36.763 --> 21:38.730

22:39.526 --> 22:41.727
No, no.

22:52.072 --> 22:56.842
The best deal
in Puerto Vallarta.

22:56.844 --> 22:59.378
Chuy never lies.
Never.

22:59.380 --> 23:01.947
The thing is,
we're really low on cash.

23:01.949 --> 23:03.982
I know, guys.
Okay, okay.

23:03.984 --> 23:06.852
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, guy.

23:06.854 --> 23:10.055
I like you, so...

23:10.057 --> 23:14.493
I give you everything for $50.

23:14.495 --> 23:16.395
- Done.
- Yeah?

23:16.397 --> 23:18.029
- Yeah.
- Okay, 50, and this.

23:18.031 --> 23:20.932
- And this what?

23:20.934 --> 23:22.634
My shirt.
He wants my shirt.

23:22.636 --> 23:24.403
- Give him the shirt.
- He wants my shirt.

23:24.405 --> 23:25.504
It's a shitty shirt anyways.
Give it to him.

23:25.506 --> 23:27.873
Okay. Okay, Chuy.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.074
Great, great, Chuy.

23:29.076 --> 23:31.710
Okay.
Shirt and $50, right?

23:31.712 --> 23:34.413
Yeah, here you go.

23:34.415 --> 23:37.082
Okay, guys!

23:37.084 --> 23:39.184
Enjoy your stay.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.558
Logan: Okay, so how
exactly do I get Lina

23:46.560 --> 23:48.427
to take me back to her room?

23:48.429 --> 23:49.761
Because she's definitely
not coming back to ours.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.430
It starts with jager bombs,

23:51.432 --> 23:52.898
and then it starts
with bold confidence.

23:52.900 --> 23:54.099
Then you just
straight up tell her,

23:54.101 --> 23:55.600
"let's go back
to your place."

23:55.602 --> 23:56.768
- I just tell her?
- Yeah.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.437
Tell her you're rooming with me

23:58.439 --> 24:00.439
and I've already got plans
to take the room.

24:00.441 --> 24:02.441
- That's good.
- That's great.

24:02.443 --> 24:03.608
- Fantastic.
- All right.

24:05.746 --> 24:08.447
- Whoa.
- This is the place.

24:10.616 --> 24:14.619
Okay.
Yeah, let's do this.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.221
Holy shit, it looks packed.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.624
You really think
these are going to work?

24:19.626 --> 24:21.626
We're about to find out.
Come on.

24:23.464 --> 24:24.930
Blake:
Excuse me. Excuse me.

24:24.932 --> 24:26.631
- Boy: Let me in.
- Boy #2: Excuse me!

24:26.633 --> 24:28.233
Excuse me.

24:31.104 --> 24:32.704
- Chuy?
- Yeah!

24:32.706 --> 24:34.639
Okay, amigos.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.775
Girl: You're going
to let them in?

24:36.777 --> 24:38.643
Boy: Come on, man, let me in.
Chuy's my cousin.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.612
Girl: I know Chuy, too.
He's my boyfriend!

24:40.614 --> 24:42.481
- Now do you believe me?
- What?

24:42.483 --> 24:46.485
- Fate!
- I can't believe it worked.

24:46.487 --> 24:49.221
Chuy! Yes! Yes!

24:50.657 --> 24:53.492
Blake:
Oh, my god.

24:53.494 --> 24:55.126
Behold...

24:55.128 --> 24:56.661
The power of the pussy!

24:56.663 --> 25:00.932
Emcee:
Ladies and gentlemen...

25:00.934 --> 25:02.267
We hit turbulence!

25:06.173 --> 25:10.709
- Whoo!
- Make some noise!

25:10.711 --> 25:15.046
- Let's go find Lina.
- Mexico!

25:15.048 --> 25:19.684
That's Steve Aoki.
That's Steve Aoki!

25:19.686 --> 25:23.889
One, two, three!
Aoki jump!

25:26.192 --> 25:27.959
Whoo!

25:34.267 --> 25:35.967
Viva Vallarta!

25:37.737 --> 25:41.540
- Get a room!
- This is awesome! Amazing!

25:41.542 --> 25:44.242
This is madness.
Oh, shit.

25:44.244 --> 25:46.845
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

25:46.847 --> 25:50.315
- Let me buy you a new one.
- Open bar. Nice watch.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.554
Dude! I told you.

25:55.556 --> 25:57.022
Chicks dig the watch.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.129
We hit turbulence!

26:04.131 --> 26:05.697
You're a rock star!

26:11.037 --> 26:13.838
See? Fate!

26:13.840 --> 26:16.074
Listen to the man.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.244
You should get
some action, girl.

26:19.246 --> 26:21.346
So many hot guys here.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.018
Blake:
Oh, there goes the table.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.320
- Holy...
- no!

26:28.322 --> 26:29.754
Oh, shit, I wasn't filming that.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.222
Go ask her to do it again.

26:31.224 --> 26:33.091
Is she okay? Come on.

26:33.093 --> 26:36.261
Emcee: Who's ready
for the cake face? You?

26:36.263 --> 26:38.096
You?

26:40.633 --> 26:42.334
I got it. Thanks.
I got it.

26:42.336 --> 26:45.770
Hi. Come on, I got you.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.606
- My head.
- Are you okay?

26:47.608 --> 26:50.075
Let me go.
I gotta pee.

26:50.077 --> 26:53.778
What? Dude.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.180
- Yes!
- Enough with the camera.

26:55.182 --> 26:57.248
Come on. Look away,
she's a lady. Stop...

26:57.250 --> 26:58.950
Blake: She's not that
much of a lady anymore.

26:58.952 --> 27:01.219
- Please, can you not...
- she'll appreciate...

27:01.221 --> 27:02.787
Logan: Please.
Can you please not?

27:02.789 --> 27:04.289
- Girl: You're drunk!
- Logan?

27:04.291 --> 27:07.058
You followed me?

27:07.060 --> 27:09.761
That's so sweet.

27:12.632 --> 27:15.266
- Hi, "Josue."
- Okay, you gotta go.

27:15.268 --> 27:17.268
I'm going night-night.
Bye, bye-bye.

27:17.270 --> 27:20.105
So much for that
dusky Mexican light.

27:20.107 --> 27:21.940
We've got to help her.

27:21.942 --> 27:24.809
Thank you, Mexico!
I love you!

27:24.811 --> 27:26.811
Hasta la vista!

27:26.813 --> 27:29.781
Emcee:
Give it up for Steve Aoki.

27:29.783 --> 27:33.284
Get ready for
the wet t-shirt contest.

27:33.286 --> 27:34.986
Make some noise, people!

27:43.663 --> 27:45.730
- A toast.
- What? No!

27:45.732 --> 27:47.832
No, Lina! Okay.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.668
Just don't do that.

27:49.670 --> 27:51.136
Come with me.
Let's get you to bed.

27:51.138 --> 27:53.138
- Logan?
- Yeah?

27:53.140 --> 27:55.674
- Let me ask you something.
- Okay.

27:55.676 --> 27:58.009
You know when someone
is the one, right?

27:58.011 --> 27:59.310
Mm-hmm.

27:59.312 --> 28:02.681
And you just...
you can't fight it.

28:02.683 --> 28:06.985
You can't fight it because
you have to be with the one.

28:06.987 --> 28:09.688
Yeah, exactly.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.990
Then why didn't Connor
come find me?

28:11.992 --> 28:14.859
Ah, fuck! Ow!

28:14.861 --> 28:17.162
Ow, fuck. Ow! Fuck!

28:17.164 --> 28:19.864
Thank you, man.
Thank you. Sorry.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.701
I'm sorry.
Who's Connor?

28:22.703 --> 28:24.436
I told him that I'd be here,

28:24.438 --> 28:28.440
so why didn't he come find me?

28:28.442 --> 28:30.709
Okay.

28:30.711 --> 28:34.112
I'm sure he just got lost.
It's a big city.

28:34.114 --> 28:36.848
Well, you found me.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.895
You vomited in my mouth.
What's wrong with you?

28:50.897 --> 28:53.364
Who does that?

28:53.366 --> 28:55.900
What's the matter, Dawg?

28:55.902 --> 28:57.969
I thought you were
into that kinky shit.

28:57.971 --> 29:01.372
You vomited into my mouth.
What's wrong with you?

29:01.374 --> 29:04.776
Don't yell at me!

29:04.778 --> 29:06.478
- You're yelling at me.
- Don't vomit in my mouth!

29:06.480 --> 29:09.180
- I hate you. I hate you.
- Oh, god.

29:09.182 --> 29:12.016
- She's fine. I'm...
- why are you yelling at me?

29:14.054 --> 29:17.522
I'm sorry. Don't cry.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.092
Lina?

29:27.133 --> 29:28.399
Emcee:
I've got one question...

29:28.401 --> 29:29.934
one question only.

29:29.936 --> 29:34.239
Are you ready to party?
This is it.

29:34.241 --> 29:36.775
We have a bunch
of beautiful contestants

29:36.777 --> 29:39.110
right now, ready to go.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.845
Here we go.

29:40.847 --> 29:41.946
Give it up for
contestant number four.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.449
Contestant number four.
Whoa.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.952
Oh, she can dance.
She can dance.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.188
Look at her go.
She's amazing.

29:50.190 --> 29:52.257
Maybe not.

29:52.259 --> 29:54.125
I'm going to need
a cleaning deposit.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.530
She's at the fiesta.

29:58.532 --> 30:02.433
20?

30:02.435 --> 30:05.436
- Oh, come...
- I need more.

30:05.438 --> 30:07.071
Okay. Okay, Chuy.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.576
Drunk pussy not pussy, man.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.119
And our final contestant
from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico,

30:21.121 --> 30:25.023
- number five!
- Yeah!

30:25.025 --> 30:27.926
Get those jugs some water.
Oh, check it out.

30:27.928 --> 30:30.128
Oh! I think we're going to
have a winner here,

30:30.130 --> 30:31.896
ladies and gentlemen.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.298
I can't hear you.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.400
The winner of
the wet t-shirt contest

30:35.402 --> 30:39.270
at spring break is number five!

30:39.272 --> 30:42.140
Let me hear you make some noise!

30:49.481 --> 30:52.217
You want a breath mint?

30:53.285 --> 30:57.322
Yeah. Thanks.

30:57.324 --> 30:58.523
Your girlfriend all right?

30:58.525 --> 31:00.091
She seemed pretty drunk.

31:00.093 --> 31:01.993
She's not my girlfriend.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.433
I love Paul Oakenfold.

31:08.435 --> 31:10.168
"Maybe love is not for me.

31:10.170 --> 31:12.637
Maybe lovers dream things
that I don't dream."

31:12.639 --> 31:15.506
It's a great song.

31:15.508 --> 31:19.878
"Harder they came,
harder they fall."

31:19.880 --> 31:22.013
- Got that right.
- What's that?

31:25.184 --> 31:27.385
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.555
Everything matters.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.362
- I'm Logan.
- I'm Gaby

31:37.364 --> 31:39.197
still want to get me a drink?

31:39.199 --> 31:40.665
Yeah.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.205
So, where you from?

31:47.207 --> 31:49.374
- From here.
- Really?

31:49.376 --> 31:51.476
Your English is really good.

31:51.478 --> 31:53.678
My boyfriend taught me.

31:53.680 --> 31:56.514
Oh, cool. Cool.

31:56.516 --> 31:59.484
I'm joking.
I don't have a boyfriend.

31:59.486 --> 32:01.552
It's still early, no?

32:05.558 --> 32:09.394
Nice. This is a great track.
It's really good.

32:09.396 --> 32:12.530
You're really into music.
You a DJ or what?

32:12.532 --> 32:15.333
I am...
Inside my own room.

32:15.335 --> 32:18.202
Outside, not so much.

32:18.204 --> 32:21.239
Well, I know the DJ here.
Go try it.

32:21.241 --> 32:25.043
- No. No, thank you.
- Why not?

32:25.045 --> 32:28.413
I want to hear what you can do.

32:28.415 --> 32:30.248
I do have this one mix.

32:30.250 --> 32:34.419
- Where?
- In a USB in my pocket,

32:34.421 --> 32:36.988
- but it's not finished.
- Let me see it.

32:36.990 --> 32:38.022
No, seriously.
It's not finished.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.490
I have more work to do on it.

32:39.492 --> 32:42.560
Why are you so scared?
Give it to me.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.397
Come on.

32:50.437 --> 32:53.404
Okay, DJ phantom, don't move.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.675
You really don't have to...

33:05.718 --> 33:08.286
dude, this is Mona.

33:08.288 --> 33:11.155
I'm going to make her a star!

33:11.157 --> 33:15.126
Whoo! Yeah!

33:16.628 --> 33:19.163
- Hi, Mona.
- I go to the bathroom.

33:19.165 --> 33:22.300
- Okay.
- She's gonna go to the ladies' room!

33:22.302 --> 33:24.469
- What is that?
- What did I tell you, buddy?

33:24.471 --> 33:27.271
Paradise!
Where's Lina?

33:27.273 --> 33:29.307
She had to go back to the hotel.

33:29.309 --> 33:31.175
We're going to meet up later.
It's all good.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.077
Tell me about Mona, dude.
Who is that?

33:33.079 --> 33:34.645
She won the wet
t-shirt contest.

33:34.647 --> 33:37.181
- I'm proud of you.
- I've been fingering her

33:37.183 --> 33:39.083
on the dance floor all night.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.385
- Wow.
- Yeah!

33:40.387 --> 33:41.552
It's when you finger a butthole.

33:41.554 --> 33:43.554
- You wanna smell?
- No. What?

33:43.556 --> 33:45.189
You are fucking gross, dude.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.025
I know.
It's so awesome.

33:47.027 --> 33:48.259
You're not serious
though, right?

33:48.261 --> 33:49.527
No, I'm dead serious.

33:49.529 --> 33:51.129
Now you've got a little
poo on your lip.

33:51.131 --> 33:52.163
No, the foam kept it clean.
It's fine.

33:52.165 --> 33:53.297
Shut up. Gaby!

33:53.299 --> 33:55.233
This is my friend Blake.

33:55.235 --> 33:56.768
Blake, this is Gaby.

33:56.770 --> 33:59.337
Hi, Gaby.

33:59.339 --> 34:01.572
It's very nice to meet you.

34:01.574 --> 34:06.277
Nice to meet you, too.

34:06.279 --> 34:08.079
Blake:
What is that?

34:08.081 --> 34:10.214
To celebrate your club debut.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.449
The DJ is going to
play your mix.

34:11.451 --> 34:13.784
- Okay, fuego!
- What?

34:16.523 --> 34:19.056
Whoo! Yeah!

34:19.059 --> 34:21.324
- You both ready?
- Ready.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.393
- Yes?
- Ready. I like her!

34:22.395 --> 34:24.529
One for you, and one for you.

34:24.531 --> 34:27.732
And, cheers, DJ phantom.

34:27.734 --> 34:31.369
- To DJ phantom.
- DJ Phantom.

34:33.705 --> 34:36.641
Whoa!
Oh, what is that?

34:36.643 --> 34:39.210
It is a secret...
to get your blood pumping.

34:39.212 --> 34:40.710
Oh, it did.

34:40.713 --> 34:43.081
Emcee:
And now, people,

34:43.083 --> 34:45.248
we have a new mix
from a new DJ...

34:45.251 --> 34:46.583
DJ phantom.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.152
Blake:
That's my friend!

34:48.154 --> 34:51.722
I know him!
That's mi amigo.

34:51.724 --> 34:54.092
- Whoo!
- I love this song.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.260
I love it.
Dance with me.

34:59.099 --> 35:00.731
Ha ha!

35:00.733 --> 35:03.367
Yeah, Logan!
DJ phantom!

35:03.369 --> 35:05.436
Whoo!

36:03.363 --> 36:04.795
Logan: I can't believe
they played my music.

36:04.797 --> 36:07.632
It's... it's so cool.
You're so great.

36:07.634 --> 36:10.301
- You're wonderful.
- Thank you so much.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.172
- Okay.
- No?

36:14.174 --> 36:17.475
- Shh.
- Okay.

36:17.477 --> 36:20.478
I'm coming up.
I'm coming up.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.647
Okay. Okay. Wait.

36:22.649 --> 36:24.649
Tranquilo.

36:24.651 --> 36:26.484
I don't know what that means.

36:26.486 --> 36:30.321
- It means, relax.
- Okay. I'm gonna relax.

36:33.659 --> 36:36.661
- Come on in.
- Nice.

36:36.663 --> 36:41.199
- This is a nice room.
- Relax, okay?

36:41.201 --> 36:43.668
- Okay.
- Tranquilo. It's okay.

36:43.670 --> 36:46.837
It's just this is my first time.

36:46.839 --> 36:48.873
Okay. Shh.

36:51.677 --> 36:55.279
Okay. Relaxed now?

36:55.281 --> 36:59.450
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

36:59.452 --> 37:01.385
- Ahh! Ow, ow, ow.
- What?

37:01.387 --> 37:03.221
My hair, my hair, my hair.

37:03.223 --> 37:05.256
Hold on, my hair.
Hold on. Wait.

37:05.258 --> 37:06.824
Okay. Okay.

37:12.799 --> 37:15.866
Logan? Logan?

38:11.456 --> 38:13.758
Viva la Mexico.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.372
Nice.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.911
Huh?

38:33.913 --> 38:35.846
What?

39:05.644 --> 39:07.478
Where are you going, lover boy?

39:10.449 --> 39:12.817
Jesus.

39:12.819 --> 39:14.518
Oh, my god! It's huge.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.687
I gotta go.
I'll call you.

39:16.689 --> 39:19.890
Right after I get some therapy.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.670
Good morning.

39:32.672 --> 39:35.005
Sorry, I must have
fallen asleep.

39:35.007 --> 39:38.008
I... where are we?

39:38.010 --> 39:41.112
A motel.
You don't remember?

39:41.114 --> 39:42.847
No, I do.

39:42.849 --> 39:45.516
Yeah, the motel last night.

39:45.518 --> 39:46.984
Last night, it was incredible.

39:46.986 --> 39:51.021
So was your mix, DJ phantom.

39:51.023 --> 39:53.023
Really? You liked it?

39:53.025 --> 39:55.659
Mm-hmm.

39:55.661 --> 39:59.630
So, can we go get breakfast?

39:59.632 --> 40:01.399
We?

40:01.401 --> 40:02.967
No, we...
we're not doing anything.

40:02.969 --> 40:04.735
I have to go.

40:04.737 --> 40:07.037
And you owe me $300.

40:07.039 --> 40:09.039
You're messing with me, right?

40:09.041 --> 40:11.008
No. No joke.

40:11.010 --> 40:14.578
Now, I need to get going,
so can we do this please?

40:14.580 --> 40:17.481
So, last night, it was just...

40:17.483 --> 40:18.749
what, you didn't like it?

40:18.751 --> 40:20.484
No, I did.
It was great.

40:20.486 --> 40:23.554
Good. Then you
won't mind paying me.

40:23.556 --> 40:29.693
Yeah.

40:29.695 --> 40:33.764
- Shit. I don't have it.
- If you don't pay me,

40:33.766 --> 40:35.065
I get in very big trouble, okay?

40:35.067 --> 40:36.867
I'm going to pay you,
I swear. Just...

40:36.869 --> 40:38.469
you better not be lying to me.

40:38.471 --> 40:40.538
I'll be back, okay?
Just wait here.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.610
Blake: Was it good
for you, you know?

40:46.612 --> 40:47.912
She tickle your balls
a little bit?

40:47.914 --> 40:48.913
She give you a little tickle?

40:48.915 --> 40:49.980
A little pickle tickle?

40:49.982 --> 40:51.081
Can you just get
the money, dude?

40:51.083 --> 40:52.750
This is it, man.

40:52.752 --> 40:54.618
After this, we are down
to our 200.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.620
I still can't believe
she's charging me.

40:56.622 --> 40:59.924
One way or the other, you
always gotta pay for the pussy.

40:59.926 --> 41:02.092
- So, how was it?
- It was amazing.

41:02.094 --> 41:03.761
She was amazing.

41:03.763 --> 41:05.062
No, I want details.

41:05.064 --> 41:07.631
For $300, did you get
some oral first?

41:07.633 --> 41:08.866
Perhaps some anal?

41:08.868 --> 41:10.634
Did Mona include anal?

41:10.636 --> 41:12.102
As a matter of fact, yes,

41:12.104 --> 41:14.104
but that's between
me and Mona, okay?

41:14.106 --> 41:16.474
I didn't have to pay her.
What happened with Gaby?

41:16.476 --> 41:19.477
- I don't remember.
- Dude, seriously.

41:19.479 --> 41:21.078
I want details or give me
my money back.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.913
Seriously, dude,
I don't remember.

41:25.952 --> 41:28.719
Shut the fuck up.
Hey, mom. How's the cruise?

41:28.721 --> 41:30.488
Janis:
It's interesting.

41:30.490 --> 41:32.756
Never been on a naked cruise
before, young man!

41:32.758 --> 41:34.258
Naked cruise?

41:34.260 --> 41:35.960
Yes, butts, penises,
and boobs everywhere!

41:35.962 --> 41:37.795
Oh, my god.
Mom, I'm so sorry.

41:37.797 --> 41:39.530
I had no idea.
Blake booked the tickets.

41:39.532 --> 41:40.865
Jan, you gotta use
sunscreen, Jan.

41:40.867 --> 41:41.899
You're going to burn your Booty!

41:41.901 --> 41:43.701
Is Blake at the house?

41:43.703 --> 41:46.070
No, he's not at the house,
because we're out.

41:46.072 --> 41:47.972
Hey, you and dad
aren't naked, are you?

41:47.974 --> 41:49.874
- Not yet.
- They're naked.

41:49.876 --> 41:51.742
Your dad wants to make sure
you got the watch.

41:51.744 --> 41:53.143
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it right...

41:53.145 --> 41:54.812
when did men start
shaving their penises?

41:54.814 --> 41:56.213
- I got it right here.
- Are you doing that?

41:56.215 --> 41:57.982
Um, so don't worry
about that or anything.

41:57.984 --> 41:59.984
Enjoy your naked time.
I gotta go.

41:59.986 --> 42:01.819
- Logan?
- Logan.

42:01.821 --> 42:03.153
- Fuck! Fuck! Fucking fuck!
- Logan? Honey?

42:03.155 --> 42:04.989
- Blake: Logan?
- Logan: Gaby, hey!

42:04.991 --> 42:06.657
Sorry I took so long.
I got your money.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.528
Gaby. Gaby, no.

42:10.530 --> 42:13.163
Gaby. Shit.

42:13.165 --> 42:16.534
Shit! Shit! Fuck!

42:16.536 --> 42:18.002
Fucking god damn it.

42:18.004 --> 42:21.005
- No.
- Logan, what is happening?

42:21.007 --> 42:23.707
Dude, she's not here.
She's not here. Shit!

42:23.709 --> 42:25.543
Well, sweet.
We just saved $300.

42:25.545 --> 42:27.311
No, and neither is the watch!

42:27.313 --> 42:31.015
What? What happened
to the watch, Logan?

42:31.017 --> 42:32.016
What do you mean?
Where's the watch?

42:32.018 --> 42:35.185
Shit! Shit!

42:35.187 --> 42:36.554
What happened to the watch?

42:36.556 --> 42:37.755
Dude, she took it.

42:37.757 --> 42:40.558
We gotta find her.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.859
Well, how the hell
are we going to do that?

42:41.861 --> 42:43.193
I don't fucking know.

42:43.195 --> 42:44.628
I can't even remember
last night.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.564
We've got to find her.
Fuck!

42:46.566 --> 42:48.732
Why the fuck did you
make me wear that thing?

42:48.734 --> 42:50.568
I didn't make you.
You looked good with it.

42:50.570 --> 42:52.002
Why did you lose it?

42:54.639 --> 42:57.207
Thank god,
here comes the cavalry.

42:57.209 --> 42:59.209
Chuy, man, he can save us.

42:59.211 --> 43:01.211
Chuy, you're a beautiful
little Mexican man.

43:01.213 --> 43:02.880
- Hey!
- I love you.

43:02.882 --> 43:04.582
We're looking for the girl
from last night.

43:04.584 --> 43:05.916
She stole his Rolex.
His Rolex.

43:05.918 --> 43:08.752
- She stole my watch.
- Really?

43:08.754 --> 43:11.889
- I need that watch.
- Okay, who?

43:11.891 --> 43:13.591
- Her.
- Her name's Gaby.

43:13.593 --> 43:15.893
- Beautiful girl, yeah.
- She's pretty.

43:15.895 --> 43:17.061
- She's also a thief.
- I find her.

43:17.063 --> 43:19.229
- What?
- I find her.

43:19.231 --> 43:22.600
- Really?
- Yeah! Chuy knows everyone!

43:22.602 --> 43:25.769
- See? I told you.
- Yeah, you were right. Thank you, Chuy.

43:25.771 --> 43:29.640
But I'll need cash for expenses.

43:29.642 --> 43:32.610
- How much?
- $50, okay?

43:32.612 --> 43:34.778
- 50?
- Yeah.

43:34.780 --> 43:35.779
No.

43:35.781 --> 43:36.914
No, Chuy. Chuy, no.

43:36.916 --> 43:40.084
- 20. 20.
- Okay, 20...

43:40.086 --> 43:41.086
And your shirt.

43:54.266 --> 43:56.100
Logan:
Are you sure she's in here?

43:56.102 --> 43:57.801
Chuy:
Yeah, but it will be tricky.

43:57.803 --> 44:00.371
The guy who owns this place
is a pendejo.

44:06.678 --> 44:08.646
This is what I call
a strip club!

44:08.648 --> 44:10.914
Focus.
We're here for the watch.

44:10.916 --> 44:13.817
I'm focused.
I'm so focused.

44:13.819 --> 44:17.221
Hey, my cousin.
Come on. El Guapo!

44:17.223 --> 44:19.723
He will take care of us.
Come on.

44:22.828 --> 44:24.995
- My cousin.
- Hi.

44:24.997 --> 44:27.765
These are my cousins
from the Uniteds.

44:27.767 --> 44:30.134
Sit down. Please, please.
Welcome. Sit.

44:45.985 --> 44:48.819
She's here?
She's coming? Okay.

46:33.358 --> 46:35.959
- Hey.
- Wait, wait.

46:35.961 --> 46:37.427
Easy, easy.

46:37.429 --> 46:39.196
El Guapo will bring her.

46:39.198 --> 46:41.198
Stick to the plan.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.534
Let's move over there.
Okay.

47:04.155 --> 47:05.155
Where's my watch?

47:07.992 --> 47:09.993
I waited for over an hour.

47:09.995 --> 47:12.162
I got your 300, so there.

47:12.164 --> 47:15.265
- Where's my watch?
- I don't have it anymore.

47:15.267 --> 47:17.968
What? Why not?
Where is it?

47:17.970 --> 47:19.336
You need to go.

47:19.338 --> 47:20.838
No, not until I get my watch.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.306
- I think you need to go.
- Gaby, no.

47:22.308 --> 47:24.474
- Seriously...
- you need to go now.

47:24.476 --> 47:27.277
- Please.
- Hey, hey, hey.

47:27.279 --> 47:30.414
Hands off...
The merchandise.

47:31.482 --> 47:33.851
So what happened here?

47:33.853 --> 47:36.854
She stole my watch.

47:36.856 --> 47:38.088
Get him. Get him.

47:38.090 --> 47:39.323
All of them in the back
right now!

47:39.325 --> 47:40.557
I don't need to go to the back.

47:40.559 --> 47:43.227
- I just need my watch.
- Shut up!

47:43.229 --> 47:45.896
Okay, man. I'm walking.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.034
Blake: Fuck, dude,
this is so fucked up.

47:51.036 --> 47:52.436
Are they going to kill us, man?

47:52.438 --> 47:53.637
I've seen this shit on the news.

47:53.639 --> 47:54.905
Logan:
I don't know, man.

47:54.907 --> 47:57.274
Now, what's all this about?

47:57.276 --> 48:00.244
- A watch?
- She stole my Rolex.

48:02.180 --> 48:04.348
Its silver with a black face.

48:04.350 --> 48:06.917
It's a part of my family.

48:06.919 --> 48:08.886
It's okay.
Take it away.

48:08.888 --> 48:11.221
That's my watch.
Jesus, that's my watch.

48:11.223 --> 48:12.223
Okay.

48:15.193 --> 48:16.393
This?

48:16.395 --> 48:18.195
Yeah, that.
That's my watch.

48:18.197 --> 48:20.564
Did you give it to him?

48:20.566 --> 48:23.500
Are you calling me a thief?

48:23.502 --> 48:26.069
No, sir.
The thing is,

48:26.071 --> 48:28.906
it belonged to my dad
and his dad before that,

48:28.908 --> 48:30.540
and it's really
important to him...

48:30.542 --> 48:32.276
And to me.

48:39.217 --> 48:41.018
Do I know you?

48:48.226 --> 48:49.927
You're lucky today,

48:49.929 --> 48:53.196
because I'm going to
give you this watch.

48:53.198 --> 48:55.365
Yes. Yes, thank you,
thank you.

48:55.367 --> 48:57.234
Thank you so much, seriously.

48:57.236 --> 49:02.272
For only $5,000.

49:02.274 --> 49:04.508
What? No, no.

49:04.510 --> 49:06.376
I don't have $5,000.

49:06.378 --> 49:08.946
Come on, my friend.
I'm giving you a real deal.

49:08.948 --> 49:11.348
It has to be
worth twice than that...

49:11.350 --> 49:13.417
"Panic."

49:15.420 --> 49:16.720
I don't like your friend.

49:16.722 --> 49:19.256
Okay, okay!

49:19.258 --> 49:21.258
Okay, so this is
a limited time offer.

49:21.260 --> 49:22.693
24 hours.
No cash, no watch.

49:22.695 --> 49:25.362
- $5,000 in 24 hours.
- Yes.

49:25.364 --> 49:27.431
How the fuck are we going to...

49:27.433 --> 49:30.600
You prefer $24,000 in 5 hours?

49:30.602 --> 49:33.437
No, no, 5,000, 24 hours.
Sounds... that's awesome.

49:33.439 --> 49:35.172
- Good.
- I'll see you in 24 hours.

49:35.174 --> 49:38.475
No more work for you tonight.
Get the fuck out.

49:38.477 --> 49:39.576
Get out!

49:43.448 --> 49:46.149
Fucking b-rate movie pimp
wanna-be.

49:46.151 --> 49:49.152
- We gotta go to the cops.
- No cops.

49:49.154 --> 49:53.156
He has many friends in the cops.

49:53.158 --> 49:54.624
Great.

49:54.626 --> 49:56.159
I gotta get
that watch back, dude.

49:56.161 --> 49:57.995
I can't go home without it.

49:57.997 --> 49:59.997
When I sell the blakejob,
we'll buy Kent a new one.

50:00.999 --> 50:03.133
Think I can buy
his trust back, too?

50:14.012 --> 50:15.612
Chuy:
Hey! Oh.

50:17.081 --> 50:18.482
Logan:
Why are you here, Gaby?

50:18.484 --> 50:20.083
Come here for the rest
of my belongings?

50:20.085 --> 50:22.019
You want my shoes?
My jeans?

50:22.021 --> 50:24.087
You want my shirt? I've got
more stuff at the hotel.

50:24.089 --> 50:26.323
Gaby: Listen, I'm
really, really sorry.

50:26.325 --> 50:28.725
- I had no choice.
- Sure you did.

50:28.727 --> 50:30.794
You chose to rob me.

50:30.796 --> 50:33.030
I was just keeping it
for collateral,

50:33.032 --> 50:34.765
but then Dorian saw it
and he took it.

50:34.767 --> 50:37.200
I'm really, really sorry, okay?

50:37.202 --> 50:39.202
I'll do anything
to help you get it back.

50:39.204 --> 50:40.804
Who the hell is this guy,
anyways?

50:40.806 --> 50:43.540
His real name
is Igor Kaganovich,

50:43.542 --> 50:46.309
but everyone calls him Dorian.

50:46.311 --> 50:48.512
Hate that pendejo.

50:48.514 --> 50:50.547
That fucking Russian
doesn't run this town,

50:50.549 --> 50:52.682
so Chuy help you.

50:52.684 --> 50:55.685
We do this together
like brothers.

50:55.687 --> 50:58.355
No charge. Together.

50:58.357 --> 51:00.424
Okay? Okay, cousin?

51:00.426 --> 51:02.059
Fuck yeah, Chuy.

51:02.061 --> 51:04.628
So how do we make
five grand in 24 hours?

51:04.630 --> 51:07.264
I know a way you could
get it in 20 minutes,

51:07.266 --> 51:11.535
but it may offend
your delicate American ways.

51:11.537 --> 51:14.371
Blake:
Delicate? Bro, I'm in!

51:20.778 --> 51:21.778
What the fuck?

51:30.655 --> 51:31.721
I can't watch this, man.
This is brutal.

51:31.723 --> 51:33.523
I know, dude,

51:33.525 --> 51:34.524
but it's our last chance
to get the watch back.

51:34.526 --> 51:36.593
It's either them or you

51:51.742 --> 51:53.743
fuck.
We haven't won once.

51:53.745 --> 51:55.479
Don't worry.

51:55.481 --> 51:59.549
You bet the same color
five times in a row,

51:59.551 --> 52:01.718
next one...
guaranteed winner!

52:01.720 --> 52:04.721
Put it all on red.
Rojo.

52:07.425 --> 52:08.792
This is fucked up.

52:38.789 --> 52:40.323
Logan:
Don't be scared.

52:40.325 --> 52:42.759
You're going to be all right.

52:44.796 --> 52:48.498
Yeah.

52:48.500 --> 52:51.268
Everything's going to
be all right.

53:05.183 --> 53:06.616
We're putting it all on green.

53:06.618 --> 53:08.652
What? You crazy?

53:08.654 --> 53:11.821
No, no, no, no.
Put it all on red.

53:11.823 --> 53:14.357
Dude, chuy's right, bro.

53:14.359 --> 53:15.792
Green is 20-1.

53:15.794 --> 53:17.494
2-1 odds on red.

53:17.496 --> 53:19.396
You won't win a lot,
but it's a start.

53:21.332 --> 53:25.368
No. We're going
with Greenie.

53:25.370 --> 53:28.705
- Are you sure?
- Do it, Chuy.

53:34.946 --> 53:36.646
Okay.

53:37.649 --> 53:39.849
Hey! Come on, come on!

54:16.554 --> 54:19.856
- Get him, Greenie!
- Come on, Greenie! Come on!

54:22.460 --> 54:24.361
Come on!

54:25.596 --> 54:26.596
Blake:
Dude.

54:33.904 --> 54:36.773
Come on, he's not even...

54:36.775 --> 54:38.775
fuck this.

54:40.311 --> 54:41.578
Where is he going?

54:41.580 --> 54:42.912
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

54:42.914 --> 54:44.748
Hey, wake up, man.
Wake up. No, come on.

54:44.750 --> 54:46.549
Wake up. This bird needs you.
Do something.

54:46.551 --> 54:48.952
Come on, man, seriously.

54:48.954 --> 54:50.287
I need this.

54:51.589 --> 54:53.623
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

54:53.625 --> 54:56.293
Come on, Chuy!
Time out! Time out!

54:56.295 --> 54:58.428
Time out, time out!
Come on, come on.

54:58.430 --> 55:00.363
- What do we do?
- Come on, come on.

55:00.365 --> 55:03.600
Hey, take the bottle!
Take the bottle!

55:06.705 --> 55:09.339
Drink. Drink!

55:11.409 --> 55:15.345
Spit! Yeah!

55:29.393 --> 55:30.827
Yeah, come on, green!

55:43.441 --> 55:45.842
Yeah!

55:48.379 --> 55:49.913
Whoo! Yeah!

55:52.817 --> 55:54.584
Come on! Whoo!

56:05.796 --> 56:08.765
Dude, you're the cock whisperer!

56:25.383 --> 56:27.617
Gracias! Gracias!

56:27.619 --> 56:28.785
Go get the cab running.

56:28.787 --> 56:30.019
I'll be there in two minutes.

56:30.021 --> 56:31.788
- Get it ready to go.
- What? Why?

56:31.790 --> 56:33.022
It's all good.
Go get it running.

56:33.024 --> 56:34.958
I love you, cock whisperer!

56:34.960 --> 56:37.427
- Come on.
- Let's get out of here.

56:46.704 --> 56:48.571
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

56:53.879 --> 56:56.045
Oh, shit! Fuck you!

56:56.047 --> 56:58.615
Fuck you! Fuck you!

57:01.887 --> 57:04.888
Let's go, let's go!
Drive, Chuy! Drive!

57:04.890 --> 57:06.055
Blake:
Logan, what did you do?

57:06.057 --> 57:07.891
Logan:
Oh, shit!

57:15.766 --> 57:17.534
What the fuck
were you doing, dude?

57:17.536 --> 57:18.968
I had to do the right thing.

57:18.970 --> 57:23.573
Radio announcer:
Mi compadre, DJ phantom.

57:23.575 --> 57:26.042
- Did he just say...
- is it?

57:26.044 --> 57:27.544
It's your mix.

57:27.546 --> 57:29.612
- They're playing your mix.
- How?

57:29.614 --> 57:31.748
I don't know, maybe you left
your music at the club.

57:31.750 --> 57:33.850
My friend hosts this radio show.

57:33.852 --> 57:37.720
- That's awesome, dude!
- Yeah, yeah, it is.

57:37.722 --> 57:39.088
You should consider the blakejob

57:39.090 --> 57:40.657
for all your representation.

57:40.659 --> 57:42.859
In fact, I think I could
do something for you.

57:42.861 --> 57:45.061
- I can pull you in...
- we need to call Dorian.

57:45.063 --> 57:46.529
Get my watch back.

57:54.104 --> 57:55.705
- Hello.
- Logan: It's panic.

57:55.707 --> 57:57.507
I've got the money.
All of it.

57:57.509 --> 57:59.242
I want my watch back tonight.

57:59.244 --> 58:01.945
Slow down, cowboy.

58:01.947 --> 58:05.815
Meet me tomorrow at Punta
De Mita beach club at noon,

58:05.817 --> 58:08.551
and don't be late.

58:10.955 --> 58:13.256
Punta De Mita beach club.
Tomorrow at noon.

58:18.195 --> 58:22.899
Now I feel much better.

58:22.901 --> 58:23.901
Spray, Dimitri!

58:35.145 --> 58:39.516
- We have arrived!
- Oh! Okay.

58:39.518 --> 58:41.618
Every time.
Every time.

58:41.620 --> 58:42.785
Gaby: I have to go
to the bathroom.

58:42.787 --> 58:46.022
- Meet you by the pool?
- Okay.

58:47.625 --> 58:51.528
Yeah, uh,
I'm pretty tired, so...

58:51.530 --> 58:54.163
And another soldier falls
to the power of the pussy.

58:54.165 --> 58:57.166
Stop. Nothing's going
to happen.

58:57.168 --> 59:00.537
Wait, do you think it might?
Seriously?

59:00.539 --> 59:01.804
That's your problem.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.641
You're too serious.

59:04.643 --> 59:07.243
Chuy, show me the sights, man.

59:07.245 --> 59:09.245
- We've got some money.
- Blake, only a little bit.

59:12.316 --> 59:14.918
Don't spend all that money.
Only a little bit.

59:14.920 --> 59:15.920
Only a little.

59:23.027 --> 59:26.329
Hey. Logan.

59:28.866 --> 59:32.735
Um, about last night...

59:32.737 --> 59:34.003
I'm really sorry.

59:34.005 --> 59:36.573
You were drunk.
It's nothing.

59:36.575 --> 59:37.907
No, it's not.

59:37.909 --> 59:39.208
You've always been
really nice to me,

59:39.210 --> 59:41.578
and I appreciate that.

59:41.580 --> 59:44.047
So, let me know
how I can make it up to you.

59:44.049 --> 59:46.683
I don't know.
Buy me a drink?

59:48.285 --> 59:51.588
Well, I can't now.
I'm actually meeting Ashley.

59:51.590 --> 59:53.222
Of course, of course.

59:53.224 --> 59:55.191
Lina:
Yeah, all right.

59:55.193 --> 59:59.162
How about a drink
tomorrow night, then?

59:59.164 --> 01:00:02.599
I really like you, Logan.

01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:04.367
I think you're
a super great guy,

01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:06.302
so I have to be honest with you.

01:00:06.304 --> 01:00:10.607
I'm in my crazy,
wild phase right now,

01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:12.909
and I just want to
experience life, you know?

01:00:12.911 --> 01:00:17.146
And there's just nothing
experienced about you.

01:00:17.148 --> 01:00:20.249
So, I'm not saying...
I'm not saying no.

01:00:20.251 --> 01:00:21.618
I'm just saying not now.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.219
Come on! Hola.

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:36.633
- Who's this?
- Who's who?

01:00:36.635 --> 01:00:40.937
Oh, Lina. Gaby...
Gaby, this is Lina.

01:00:40.939 --> 01:00:42.305
Forget this skinny Gringita,

01:00:42.307 --> 01:00:45.875
because I found a friend
for our threesome.

01:00:45.877 --> 01:00:48.645
- Threesome?
- Threesome?

01:00:48.647 --> 01:00:51.280
Sí. Sí.
She's my caliente.

01:00:51.282 --> 01:00:55.018
- So, come on.
- Yeah.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.954
- Hey, Logan.
- Yeah?

01:00:57.956 --> 01:01:00.723
Club Strana tomorrow night?

01:01:00.725 --> 01:01:02.659
- Come on, come on.
- Sure.

01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:04.127
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:01:04.129 --> 01:01:06.429
Okay. Bye!

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:09.866
What?

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:12.135
See?

01:01:12.137 --> 01:01:15.138
She's totally into you now.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.839
I can't believe that worked.

01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:18.107
You ready for our threesome?

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.145
I'm messing with you.

01:01:22.147 --> 01:01:23.312
Oh.

01:01:23.314 --> 01:01:24.681
Goodnight, Logan.

01:01:24.683 --> 01:01:26.249
- Wait, don't go.
- What?

01:01:26.251 --> 01:01:28.718
Afraid Lina
won't see us together?

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.286
I just like talking to you.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.693
Logan:
My parents would kill me

01:01:36.695 --> 01:01:38.861
if they found out I was here.

01:01:38.863 --> 01:01:41.130
Mine would kill me if they
knew I was a stripper.

01:01:41.132 --> 01:01:44.333
How do you keep them
from finding out?

01:01:44.335 --> 01:01:46.269
Easy.
They're both gone.

01:01:46.271 --> 01:01:49.305
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:56.879
Whoa.

01:01:56.881 --> 01:01:58.047
What?

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:07.890
What happened to your parents?

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:11.761
My dad was a gringo tourist
who got my mom pregnant.

01:02:11.763 --> 01:02:15.898
He was a salesman.
My mom was an English teacher.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.867
By the time I was born,
he was gone.

01:02:17.869 --> 01:02:21.204
Then when I was ten,
my mom died,

01:02:21.206 --> 01:02:26.008
so my grandpa took care of me
until he got sick.

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:30.413
But I didn't know how
to pay the hospital bills

01:02:30.415 --> 01:02:32.915
and Dorian saw me dancing

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:36.052
and offered me a loan and a job.

01:02:36.054 --> 01:02:38.154
You are an incredible dancer.

01:02:38.156 --> 01:02:40.389
I thought that's all
I'd be doing... dancing.

01:02:40.391 --> 01:02:44.026
But then clients
kept asking for more

01:02:44.028 --> 01:02:48.264
and Dorian just doesn't
take no for an answer.

01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:49.866
I had no choice.

01:02:49.868 --> 01:02:52.235
But then an older girl
took pity on me

01:02:52.237 --> 01:02:54.337
and showed me a trick...
it's called Rohypnol.

01:02:54.339 --> 01:02:56.272
It's a pill that puts
clients to sleep.

01:02:56.274 --> 01:03:00.943
You roofied me.
Wait, but why?

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.411
I never would have
tried anything.

01:03:02.413 --> 01:03:06.115
I know that... now.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.955
- You have to quit.
- I will. I will.

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:15.091
I took a second job
at the hotel,

01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:17.426
and I'm going to
go back to school

01:03:17.428 --> 01:03:20.997
and make my grandpa proud of me.

01:03:20.999 --> 01:03:25.434
But first I have
to pay Dorian back

01:03:25.436 --> 01:03:26.936
or then he'll own me forever.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:35.845
At the club,
why'd you choose me?

01:03:35.847 --> 01:03:39.015
They teach you to look
for certain things.

01:03:39.017 --> 01:03:42.285
Logan:
Like a super expensive watch.

01:03:42.287 --> 01:03:44.253
Gaby: Sí.

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:54.530
Logan, my real name is Jessica.

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:59.135
Nice to meet you, Jessica.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.504
You, too.

01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:40.176
It was always
a special place for me.

01:04:40.178 --> 01:04:42.345
I never brought anyone here.

01:04:50.889 --> 01:04:53.256
Come on! Hurry up!

01:04:53.258 --> 01:04:54.457
I'm coming!

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.352
Blake:
Details. Details!

01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:24.654
I want to know everything, okay?

01:05:24.656 --> 01:05:26.389
Okay. You're out
of your fucking mind.

01:05:26.391 --> 01:05:27.957
Come on!

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:32.662
Why aren't you
answering me, Logan?

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:38.100
We're going to get
the watch, all right?

01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:40.102
Hey, look, look, look!

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:42.104
- Whoo!
- Blake: Look, look, look!

01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:43.406
Look at all those girls!

01:05:43.408 --> 01:05:46.609
- Yeah, I told you!
- Whoo!

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:50.446
Yeah!

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:54.050
I thought this was
a business meeting.

01:05:54.052 --> 01:05:55.551
Chuy: This is how
we do business here.

01:05:55.553 --> 01:05:57.954
Is that where we're going?

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:05.428
- Chuy!
- Come on!

01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:07.596
- You're a fucking madman.
- Let's go.

01:06:07.598 --> 01:06:11.267
Thanks, guys.
It's pussy paradise!

01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:13.602
Hey, guys.
You look thirsty.

01:06:13.604 --> 01:06:16.138
- Wow.
- Okay.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.406
Can you tell us where Dorian is?

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:20.276
- He's up there.
- Great, thanks.

01:06:20.278 --> 01:06:23.479
- Catch you later.
- Dude, come on.

01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:25.081
What?
Dude, she's so into me.

01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:26.449
- You didn't see that?
- Yeah.

01:06:26.451 --> 01:06:28.084
- She was flush in the face.
- Sure, dude.

01:06:28.086 --> 01:06:29.452
She was getting sweaty and shit.

01:06:29.454 --> 01:06:31.620
Oh! No, that's...
that's Chris lake.

01:06:31.622 --> 01:06:34.223
- Logan: Dude!
- That's Chris lake!

01:06:34.225 --> 01:06:37.426
- What? Yeah!
- Hey!

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:48.604
Hey, hey.

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.508
What are you doing with my dog?

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:53.709
He likes me.
Can we do this?

01:06:55.646 --> 01:06:58.180
Let's go.

01:06:58.182 --> 01:06:59.182
Hurry.

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:15.498
Dude, what the...

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.666
oh, my head.

01:07:17.668 --> 01:07:20.236
Oh, I need a hospital.

01:07:20.238 --> 01:07:23.706
Why are we naked?

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:27.076
Dude, there's makeup
all over your body.

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:31.347
There's makeup
all over your body.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:37.186
What the fuck happened?
Where's your watch?

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:43.325
Logan:
Here it is. $5,000.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.365
Dorian:
This calls for a drink!

01:07:49.367 --> 01:07:53.169
Let's toast.
For a new beginning.

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:06.082
Blake: What the fuck?

01:08:08.486 --> 01:08:11.287
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

01:08:11.289 --> 01:08:13.622
Where are our clothes?

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:28.770
I'm going to throw up.
I'm going to throw up.

01:08:28.773 --> 01:08:30.372
Blake:
Hey!

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.511
- Oh, shit.
- I think you need to close the door.

01:08:37.348 --> 01:08:38.747
- Where is it?
- I got it. I got it.

01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:41.350
Oh, fuck. Hello?

01:08:41.352 --> 01:08:42.685
- Dorian: Panic!
- You fucking asshole.

01:08:42.687 --> 01:08:44.453
What happened to new beginnings

01:08:44.455 --> 01:08:46.721
- and all that bullshit?
- This is, my friend,

01:08:46.724 --> 01:08:48.424
the new beginning for you

01:08:48.426 --> 01:08:51.560
of a very long
jail sentence for you.

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:55.430
And take good care
of the car, huh?

01:08:55.433 --> 01:08:57.700
It belongs to the mayor
of Puerto Vallarta.

01:08:57.702 --> 01:09:00.136
- The mayor's car?
- The major's car?

01:09:00.138 --> 01:09:02.238
- This is bad.
- This is the mayor's car?

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.140
Very bad!
This is the car!

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.877
Dorian:
Here comes the best part.

01:09:07.879 --> 01:09:11.346
The car has just
been reported as stolen!

01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:13.381
Stolen? Shit.
We're in a stolen car.

01:09:13.384 --> 01:09:15.251
Keys.
We gotta find the keys.

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:17.319
Fuck the keys!
Move over, Guerito!

01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:20.421
- Move over!
- Que Pasa!

01:09:22.627 --> 01:09:25.694
Our dicks are touching!
Our dicks are touching!

01:09:25.696 --> 01:09:28.697
Get out of here!

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.698
Chuy, drive.

01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:32.935
Chuy, drive. Chuy, drive.
We're going to jail!

01:09:32.937 --> 01:09:35.504
We're going to jail!
Drive!

01:09:54.659 --> 01:09:57.426
Holy shit!

01:09:57.428 --> 01:09:58.694
Motorcycles in action

01:09:58.696 --> 01:10:00.663
are huge in
international markets!

01:10:00.665 --> 01:10:02.531
How about getting ass-raped
in Mexican prison?

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:06.969
Oh, shit!

01:10:06.971 --> 01:10:08.804
- Oh, shit.
- Shit!

01:10:08.806 --> 01:10:10.673
Logan: Fuck.

01:10:10.675 --> 01:10:13.542
- Holy shit!
- Hold on!

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.616
- Blake: Oh, my god!
- We lost one. We lost one.

01:10:20.618 --> 01:10:22.418
We have a motorcycle on our ass.

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:28.624
Chuy, not now!

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:34.863
Drive, drive, drive, drive!

01:10:34.865 --> 01:10:37.733
Drive! Go! Shit!

01:10:42.406 --> 01:10:45.774
- Aah!
- Logan: Watch it!

01:10:45.776 --> 01:10:47.409
Lose them, Chuy!
I don't want to go to jail!

01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:49.411
This is not a street!

01:10:52.983 --> 01:10:54.717
Wrong way!
Wrong way, Chuy!

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:03.259
Blake:
Whoo! This is awesome!

01:11:03.261 --> 01:11:04.860
Logan:
Oh, shit!

01:11:06.663 --> 01:11:09.298
There's no way out!
Watch it, watch it!

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.734
Oh, shit!

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:16.939
No, we can't drive there.
There's people, Chuy.

01:11:19.043 --> 01:11:21.744
- I think that's it!
- Cover your faces!

01:11:21.746 --> 01:11:25.748
Cover your faces! Cover!

01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:39.461
Logan, I love you,
if we don't survive this!

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.000
- That was amazing!
- Logan: Oh, my god!

01:11:45.002 --> 01:11:46.568
Blake:
Chuy, you're the master!

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:48.337
Logan:
They're behind us.

01:11:52.643 --> 01:11:55.477
What?
You're freaking me out, man!

01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:59.448
- What are you doing?
- Confessing my sins in case we die.

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:01.450
- Confess?
- Die?

01:12:01.452 --> 01:12:03.886
Aah!

01:12:03.888 --> 01:12:07.623
Okay. Uh, I think
I slept with a she-male.

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.325
She had a penis!
A really big penis.

01:12:09.327 --> 01:12:10.559
Bigger than mine.

01:12:10.561 --> 01:12:12.328
I didn't even sleep with Gaby.

01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:13.662
She roofied me.
I'm still a virgin!

01:12:13.664 --> 01:12:14.830
- What?
- Don't kill me!

01:12:14.832 --> 01:12:18.734
A virgin?
I slept with a dude!

01:12:25.376 --> 01:12:26.709
Puto Madre.

01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:33.882
Chuy, there's a gate!

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:38.053
Oh, shit!

01:12:38.055 --> 01:12:39.555
Chuy, he's right behind us.

01:12:50.734 --> 01:12:52.601
Motherfucker!

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:03.379
Blake:
Watch out! Watch out!

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:11.787
All: Yeah!

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.658
- Logan: I think we lost them!
- Blake: No cops!

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.893
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:36.578
Logan:
We're going to jail.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.782
- Oh, my god.
- We're going to jail.

01:13:39.784 --> 01:13:41.150
Never.

01:13:43.887 --> 01:13:45.020
Logan:
Shit, Chuy!

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:51.026
No, Chuy!
Where are we going?

01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:29.064
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:29.066 --> 01:14:30.632
Okay.

01:14:31.936 --> 01:14:36.071
Whoo! Fuck you!

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:43.078
Epic, bro! Whoo!

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:46.482
Yeah, epic,
except we have no clothes,

01:14:46.484 --> 01:14:48.116
no money, and no fucking watch.

01:14:48.118 --> 01:14:50.486
Dude, at least
we're not in jail.

01:14:50.488 --> 01:14:52.488
And let's keep it that way.

01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:54.156
- Yeah!
- Let's go!

01:14:58.962 --> 01:15:01.497
Look, when we get back,

01:15:01.499 --> 01:15:03.499
we'll find out
where Dorian lives,

01:15:03.501 --> 01:15:05.133
and then wait until he's asleep

01:15:05.135 --> 01:15:06.502
and we'll steal the watch back.

01:15:06.504 --> 01:15:08.971
I'm being serious, dude.
Why not?

01:15:08.973 --> 01:15:11.573
Stop. Stop helping.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.679
You know, none of this
would have even happened

01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:19.948
if you'd just manned up
with Lina in the first place.

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:23.685
What?

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:25.220
None of this would have
happened if I manned up?

01:15:25.222 --> 01:15:26.855
How about none of this
would have happened

01:15:26.857 --> 01:15:29.024
if you weren't
such a selfish douchebag?

01:15:29.026 --> 01:15:30.526
Selfish?

01:15:30.528 --> 01:15:31.994
Dude, I did all of this

01:15:31.996 --> 01:15:33.695
just so you could get with Lina.

01:15:33.697 --> 01:15:36.732
No, you did all of this
for your fucking website, man.

01:15:36.734 --> 01:15:38.700
You've been shooting
the whole fucking time.

01:15:38.702 --> 01:15:40.235
This trip?
Material for your website.

01:15:40.237 --> 01:15:42.137
My dad's fucking Porsche?

01:15:42.139 --> 01:15:45.173
Material for your
fucking website, dude!

01:15:45.175 --> 01:15:48.577
You don't give a shit about me.

01:15:48.579 --> 01:15:50.712
How can you say that?

01:15:50.714 --> 01:15:53.081
Because you
fucking used me, man.

01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:54.850
Fuck you.

01:15:54.852 --> 01:15:57.119
Fuck me, man?
I just want to get the watch,

01:15:57.121 --> 01:15:59.154
get home, and we're done.

01:16:01.024 --> 01:16:02.791
Then we're done.

01:16:02.793 --> 01:16:04.660
Chuy:
Hey! Boys!

01:16:04.662 --> 01:16:06.862
What's up?

01:16:06.864 --> 01:16:08.730
Come on, let's go.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.569
Come on.
Here. Here.

01:16:13.571 --> 01:16:14.870
Come on, man.
Fuck it.

01:16:14.872 --> 01:16:16.572
Vamanos! Vamanos!

01:16:16.574 --> 01:16:18.774
We're supposed to be
on vacation, Logan!

01:16:18.776 --> 01:16:23.045
Nice ass, Logan!
It's chalky white!

01:16:23.047 --> 01:16:24.580
I'm going to enjoy the view.

01:16:24.582 --> 01:16:26.715
Get a nice tan on my dick.

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:51.206
What happened?

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:55.077
Long story.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:16:58.981
Blake: Hmph.

01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:01.683
Come on, I'll tell you inside.

01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:08.123
Keep it flowing.

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:09.791
Let's face it.

01:17:09.793 --> 01:17:11.994
- He fucking outplayed us.
- No, he didn't.

01:17:11.996 --> 01:17:14.162
You tried to play fair,
but Dorian does not play fair.

01:17:14.164 --> 01:17:16.932
We have to stop fucking around

01:17:16.934 --> 01:17:18.834
and take this to the next level.

01:17:18.836 --> 01:17:20.769
Sí.

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:24.706
How do we do that?

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:31.279
Come on, Sammy.
Come on!

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.695
Come on, Sammy.

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:54.302
Careful, Sammy.

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:58.173
Very good.
Very good, Sammy.

01:17:58.175 --> 01:18:00.942
Good dog.
Good! Obedient.

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:10.185
Good, Sammy.
Good dog.

01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:15.991
What? Sammy!

01:18:15.993 --> 01:18:17.059
Sammy, where are you?

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:29.037
Have you seen my dog?
A little dog?

01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:31.440
Boston terrier?
A small dog, very ugly?

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.014
Logan:
It's okay, boy.

01:18:39.016 --> 01:18:40.916
Blake: The power of the pussy.
It never fails.

01:18:40.918 --> 01:18:42.884
Yeah, never.

01:18:42.886 --> 01:18:45.020
Gotta get the Chiquita
back to my cousin.

01:18:45.022 --> 01:18:47.022
See you there.
At the club, yeah?

01:18:47.024 --> 01:18:48.724
Come on. See you!

01:18:48.726 --> 01:18:50.158
- See you!
- Later, dickhead!

01:18:53.764 --> 01:18:56.431
- We have the package.
- Okay.

01:18:56.433 --> 01:18:57.966
Sammy!

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.742
Gaby, what do you want now?
I'm busy.

01:19:06.744 --> 01:19:09.845
What's the matter?
Lose something?

01:19:09.847 --> 01:19:11.379
You fucking bitch.

01:19:11.381 --> 01:19:12.414
You're going to pay for this.

01:19:12.416 --> 01:19:14.049
If you want to see Sammy,

01:19:14.051 --> 01:19:16.752
you bring the watch
and the cash to sky club.

01:19:16.754 --> 01:19:20.288
- Tonight.
- Fucking bitch.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:42.210
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:45.414 --> 01:19:47.048
Dickhead.

01:19:48.251 --> 01:19:49.251
Douchebag.

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:57.926
Are we cool?
Because I need you.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.264
On three.

01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:08.170
- One.
- Both: Two.

01:20:08.172 --> 01:20:09.938
- Both: Three.
- I'm sorry.

01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.306
Fuck you. You need me.

01:20:11.308 --> 01:20:12.440
You're such an asshole.

01:20:12.442 --> 01:20:13.975
You're such an asshole, come on.

01:20:13.977 --> 01:20:14.976
All right, bring it in.
Bring it in.

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:15.978
Can you say sorry?

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.848
I love you, man.
Sorry.

01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:20.849
Thank you.

01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:23.151
Man, I love you so much.

01:20:23.153 --> 01:20:24.452
I missed you.
This feels good.

01:20:28.024 --> 01:20:30.091
Here are your towels.

01:20:30.093 --> 01:20:31.560
- That's cool.
- Oh, yeah.

01:20:31.562 --> 01:20:33.461
- We're cool. Right?
- We're good.

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:37.999
I just wanted the one, man,
but that's cool.

01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:40.302
- Have fun.
- What do you mean?

01:20:40.304 --> 01:20:42.304
We're not trying to have
that kind of fun.

01:20:42.306 --> 01:20:45.006
The towels aren't...
he thinks we're going to fuck.

01:20:45.008 --> 01:20:46.408
Aren't we going to have
make-up sex?

01:21:10.166 --> 01:21:11.366
The dog!

01:21:11.368 --> 01:21:12.567
First the watch.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:16.271
What about the cash?

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:24.579
You're going home now, boy.

01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:34.022
- It was a pleasure.
- Not so fast.

01:21:34.024 --> 01:21:36.124
The thing, my friends,

01:21:36.126 --> 01:21:38.560
I really fucking hate to lose.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.900
Yeah, I thought
you'd feel that way.

01:21:44.902 --> 01:21:47.102
- Chuy?
- Cousins!

01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:50.105
What?

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:57.445
What the fuck is going on here?

01:21:57.447 --> 01:21:58.580
What is this?

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:12.160
Sammy!
Sammy, come here!

01:22:12.162 --> 01:22:14.396
Go and get him! Go!

01:22:14.398 --> 01:22:17.365
Fucking pair of idiots.

01:22:19.402 --> 01:22:24.940
Okay, so maybe...

01:22:24.942 --> 01:22:26.241
Another time.

01:22:26.243 --> 01:22:28.610
Gaby, come with me.

01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:33.615
What are you doing?

01:22:33.617 --> 01:22:36.117
You owe me, right?

01:22:36.119 --> 01:22:38.586
And I will pay you,

01:22:38.588 --> 01:22:41.122
but my way, not yours.

01:22:41.124 --> 01:22:44.225
Ha! And how are you
fucking going to do it?

01:22:44.227 --> 01:22:46.661
By working double shifts
in that fucking hotel

01:22:46.663 --> 01:22:49.030
for $4.00 an hour
plus tips?

01:22:49.032 --> 01:22:52.000
You will never
make enough money.

01:22:52.002 --> 01:22:53.501
You will be always in my debt.

01:22:53.503 --> 01:22:55.136
Forever.

01:22:55.138 --> 01:22:56.738
How much does she owe you?

01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.440
How much?

01:22:58.442 --> 01:23:00.442
She owes me more money
than you can ever dream,

01:23:00.444 --> 01:23:02.143
than you can ever imagine,
than you can ever...

01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:04.612
$10,892.

01:23:04.614 --> 01:23:07.615
Plus interest, my love.

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:13.288
Well, we got $5,000 here,

01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:16.624
and it's close to another
thousand right there.

01:23:16.626 --> 01:23:20.195
Too bad, my friend.
It's not enough.

01:23:20.197 --> 01:23:22.464
You're almost there,
but yet, nothing.

01:23:22.466 --> 01:23:24.299
So enjoy your vacation...

01:23:24.301 --> 01:23:26.634
Alone.

01:23:26.636 --> 01:23:30.772
Yes... alone.

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:33.174
I'll give you the watch.

01:23:34.543 --> 01:23:36.011
No, no, no. You can't.
You can't.

01:23:36.013 --> 01:23:38.013
Dude, after all
we've been through?

01:23:38.015 --> 01:23:39.147
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:40.648
What's going on here?

01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:42.650
Why are you talking,
the guy with the fucking tie?

01:23:42.652 --> 01:23:44.386
Shut up.

01:23:44.388 --> 01:23:46.755
You said it yourself,
the watch is worth a lot more.

01:23:46.757 --> 01:23:48.490
- Yes.
- And you're lucky,

01:23:48.492 --> 01:23:49.491
because I like your dog,

01:23:49.493 --> 01:23:51.059
so I'll cut you a deal.

01:23:51.061 --> 01:23:52.660
I'll give you this watch

01:23:52.662 --> 01:23:54.729
- to clear Jessica's debt.
- Deal done.

01:24:03.506 --> 01:24:04.773
After all,
you've been very lucky

01:24:04.775 --> 01:24:06.107
that I didn't kill you.

01:24:06.109 --> 01:24:07.242
You know why?

01:24:07.244 --> 01:24:09.644
Your daddy will do it for me.

01:24:12.681 --> 01:24:14.315
Hasta la vista, my friend.

01:24:16.052 --> 01:24:18.720
Tony, let's go.

01:24:18.722 --> 01:24:21.823
Crazy, stupid gringo.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:25.827
- What did you do?
- What I had to.

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:32.467
Chuy?

01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:35.537
Thank you, man.

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:37.772
For everything.

01:24:37.774 --> 01:24:40.542
Nah, nah.

01:24:40.544 --> 01:24:41.576
Nah.

01:24:48.217 --> 01:24:51.352
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

01:24:56.725 --> 01:24:58.560
Thank you, god.

01:24:58.562 --> 01:25:00.395
You are one
bad-ass Mexican, Chuy!

01:25:00.397 --> 01:25:04.399
And you are some crazy Gueritos!

01:25:04.401 --> 01:25:06.301
Let's go party,
you crazy Mexicans!

01:25:06.303 --> 01:25:07.368
Chuy: Okay!

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.574
Fiesta!

01:25:12.576 --> 01:25:14.742
Vamanos, Primos!

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:21.816
It's just a watch, right?

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.387
- Right?
- Thank you.

01:25:49.513 --> 01:25:51.779
Emcee:
Put your hands together!

01:25:51.781 --> 01:25:54.782
Make some noise for Adrian Lux!

01:26:00.623 --> 01:26:02.157
Oh, shit.

01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:03.191
Lina.

01:26:03.193 --> 01:26:05.627
Um, just give me a second.

01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:15.637
Hey! I've been
looking for you.

01:26:15.639 --> 01:26:17.639
Yeah, about that, listen.

01:26:17.641 --> 01:26:19.340
Everything you said about me,
it's true.

01:26:19.342 --> 01:26:23.545
I'm not crazy.
I'm not wild or experienced.

01:26:23.547 --> 01:26:25.346
I'm in love.

01:26:28.485 --> 01:26:30.318
I see.

01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:34.355
But if you're looking
for wild and crazy...

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.199
Friends?

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:47.268
Friends.

01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:48.870
See you on the dance floor.

01:26:48.872 --> 01:26:50.838
Whoo!

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.375
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:26:54.377 --> 01:26:56.377
Puerto Vallarta,
give it up for Adrian Lux.

01:26:56.379 --> 01:26:58.613
He rocked the house tonight.

01:26:58.615 --> 01:27:00.882
DJ phantom is in the house,

01:27:00.884 --> 01:27:03.718
and he's going to
play his powerful mix

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.853
just for you guys.

01:27:05.855 --> 01:27:07.722
No, no, I can't.

01:27:07.724 --> 01:27:09.557
I can't hear you guys!
Are you ready?

01:27:09.559 --> 01:27:12.393
Maybe you,

01:27:12.395 --> 01:27:15.230
you Logan, can't,

01:27:15.232 --> 01:27:16.998
but... hold on.

01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:20.702
DJ phantom can.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.673
Come.

01:27:27.443 --> 01:27:29.711
Adrian Lux,

01:27:29.713 --> 01:27:31.846
meet Jessica and DJ phantom,

01:27:31.848 --> 01:27:33.248
good friends of mine.

01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:35.383
- Good luck, man.
- Whoo! Logan!

01:27:35.385 --> 01:27:37.619
Thank you. Great mix.

01:27:37.621 --> 01:27:39.554
- Here.
- Lina: Logan!

01:27:39.556 --> 01:27:41.322
It's all yours, man.

01:27:41.324 --> 01:27:45.627
- Good luck.
- You're a rock star! Whoo!

01:27:50.367 --> 01:27:52.600
Shit. Shit, come on. No.

01:27:52.602 --> 01:27:54.569
- Logan!
- Not now, come on.

01:27:54.571 --> 01:27:57.372
Lina:
Show us what you can do!

01:27:57.374 --> 01:27:59.540
Relax, you can do this.

01:28:06.616 --> 01:28:08.916
Man: Okay, you've got this.
All right.

01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:24.332
Turn that shit up!

01:28:31.775 --> 01:28:32.974
Work it, Blake!
Work it!

01:28:32.976 --> 01:28:34.409
Caliente!

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:10.778
This had been the best trip
of my life.

01:29:12.981 --> 01:29:14.916
I can't believe
I'm leaving today.

01:29:20.055 --> 01:29:21.856
I have to go.

01:29:21.858 --> 01:29:24.759
- Jessica, what?
- I can't do this.

01:29:24.761 --> 01:29:26.527
- Jessica, hey, hey, hey.
- It's too painful.

01:29:26.529 --> 01:29:27.628
What's wrong?
What happened?

01:29:29.999 --> 01:29:31.933
I don't know what that means.
Please don't go.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:35.837
Jessica.
Jessica, come on!

01:29:35.839 --> 01:29:37.672
No! Please!

01:29:37.674 --> 01:29:38.806
Jessica!

01:29:40.676 --> 01:29:42.143
What does that mean?

01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:50.385
It's a very common story
in Vallarta, amigos.

01:29:50.387 --> 01:29:53.020
The Mexican girl
who falls in love

01:29:53.022 --> 01:29:57.692
with the gringo tourist.

01:29:57.694 --> 01:30:01.162
And then hearts are broken.

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.410
Ooh! Ouch, that hurt.

01:30:15.412 --> 01:30:17.578
Come on, I'll help you.

01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.046
- Come on, stud.
- I'm gonna lift you.

01:30:19.048 --> 01:30:21.883
Ugh. Ooh!
Light as a feather.

01:30:21.885 --> 01:30:22.885
Like a...

01:30:26.422 --> 01:30:28.589
thank you.
Bring them up here.

01:30:28.591 --> 01:30:29.690
Come on up.
Thank you.

01:30:32.595 --> 01:30:34.595
- Hey.
- Hey, Logan. What's with the door?

01:30:34.597 --> 01:30:36.197
I don't know.
It was working fine for me.

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:38.733
I'm going to check the garage.

01:30:38.735 --> 01:30:40.034
Nice to see you, too, dad.

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:44.906
Hey, so, sorry about
the whole naked cruise.

01:30:44.908 --> 01:30:47.608
- How was it?
- It started out strange,

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:51.078
but it turned out to be okay.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.614
- Yay.
- So how about you?

01:30:53.616 --> 01:30:56.083
- Did you...
- did the whole list.

01:30:56.085 --> 01:31:00.755
Oh, see, honey,
I knew we could trust you.

01:31:00.757 --> 01:31:01.889
Yeah.

01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:05.960
What's different?

01:31:08.764 --> 01:31:11.165
You look handsome.

01:31:15.638 --> 01:31:17.104
Everything okay?

01:31:17.106 --> 01:31:18.773
Oh, it's nothing.

01:31:18.775 --> 01:31:22.743
Just a little sunburn on my ass.

01:31:22.745 --> 01:31:24.979
Kent: Logan?

01:31:24.981 --> 01:31:26.113
Logan!

01:31:26.115 --> 01:31:29.116
Yeah!
Yeah, I'm coming!

01:31:29.118 --> 01:31:30.251
Oh, shit.

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:36.123
Hey, what's up?

01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:39.494
Well, Logan, the car looks good.

01:31:39.496 --> 01:31:40.795
Clean as a whistle.

01:31:40.797 --> 01:31:42.129
Yeah, didn't touch it.

01:31:42.131 --> 01:31:44.065
Did a good job
on your to-do list.

01:31:44.067 --> 01:31:45.500
Mm-hmm.

01:31:45.502 --> 01:31:49.504
Mowed the lawn,
put garbage cans back.

01:31:49.506 --> 01:31:51.172
Noticed you're
not wearing my watch.

01:31:51.174 --> 01:31:52.507
You didn't scratch it, did you?

01:31:52.509 --> 01:31:53.875
No, I didn't scratch it.

01:31:53.877 --> 01:31:55.543
Tell me you didn't
scratch my watch.

01:31:55.545 --> 01:31:56.677
- I didn't scratch your watch.
- Thank god.

01:31:56.679 --> 01:31:59.013
- I lost it.
- You lost it?

01:31:59.015 --> 01:32:00.615
You lost the Rolex?

01:32:00.617 --> 01:32:02.149
Yes, and I'm going to
do whatever I can

01:32:02.151 --> 01:32:03.818
- to make it up to you.
- You didn't lose a Rolex.

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.587
You lost your
grandfather's Rolex.

01:32:06.589 --> 01:32:09.524
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:32:09.526 --> 01:32:12.159
I can't tell you
how bad it makes me feel.

01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:14.996
I can tell you how bad
it makes me feel...

01:32:14.998 --> 01:32:16.378
like I can't trust you.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.668
And you're supposed to be
running off to college.

01:32:21.837 --> 01:32:23.204
About college...

01:32:26.542 --> 01:32:31.012
I'd like to take a year off,
pursue my music.

01:32:31.014 --> 01:32:32.547
Go abroad.

01:32:32.549 --> 01:32:35.182
See things for myself
like you did.

01:32:35.184 --> 01:32:36.851
Me?

01:32:36.853 --> 01:32:38.920
Dad, mom told me
you took a year off

01:32:38.922 --> 01:32:40.821
before college to travel Europe.

01:32:40.823 --> 01:32:43.124
She said she never would
have met you if you hadn't.

01:32:43.126 --> 01:32:45.159
And then where would you be?

01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:47.161
Where would I be?

01:32:52.334 --> 01:32:57.705
Logan, you didn't lose
your grandfather's watch.

01:32:57.707 --> 01:33:00.575
- I didn't?
- No.

01:33:00.577 --> 01:33:02.276
I lost your grandfather's Rolex.

01:33:02.278 --> 01:33:04.679
You lost the replacement.

01:33:07.215 --> 01:33:08.783
Wow.

01:33:08.785 --> 01:33:11.719
I had no idea.

01:33:14.056 --> 01:33:15.056
Feels like shit, doesn't it?

01:33:15.058 --> 01:33:16.857
Feels like shit.

01:33:19.595 --> 01:33:20.728
I'm sorry.

01:33:22.598 --> 01:33:24.031
And I'm sorry.

01:33:27.603 --> 01:33:29.837
Year abroad, huh?

01:33:29.839 --> 01:33:32.673
- Yeah.
- What's her name?

01:33:32.675 --> 01:33:33.908
Who's name?

01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:34.909
The girl you're in love with.

01:33:34.911 --> 01:33:37.078
What's her name?

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.613
Jessica.

01:33:38.615 --> 01:33:41.248
- Is she hot?
- Whew.

01:34:00.637 --> 01:34:03.270
Thank you, Mexico.
Thank you, puerto Vallarta.

01:34:03.272 --> 01:34:06.907
Now, coming up is a DJ
that I've been working with.

01:34:06.909 --> 01:34:11.812
Please welcome phantom!

01:34:14.984 --> 01:34:17.118
- Thank you, man.
- Nice one, buddy.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.854
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Good luck.

01:35:09.337 --> 01:35:12.006
What are you doing here?

01:35:13.976 --> 01:35:17.144
I finally found out
what that means.

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:23.944
Logan: Let's see
what Blake is up to.

01:36:23.946 --> 01:36:25.946
- Aah!
- Oh, my god.

01:36:25.948 --> 01:36:28.149
- Oh! What the fuck?
- Look at that ass!

01:36:28.151 --> 01:36:29.784
This is supposed to be private!

01:36:29.786 --> 01:36:31.285
I don't do this to you.
Yes, you do.

01:36:31.287 --> 01:36:32.820
Okay, fine, but I'm
going to get you back.

01:36:32.822 --> 01:36:34.255
Don't stop.
You can continue.

01:36:34.257 --> 01:36:35.422
- This is bullshit.
- Everything okay?

01:36:35.424 --> 01:36:37.258
Oh, Blake was right.

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:39.960
Your privates are the first
thing to get toasted.

01:36:39.962 --> 01:36:41.962
Oh, no, mom!
I'm your son.

01:36:41.964 --> 01:36:44.565
Put that...
put that away, no.

01:36:47.269 --> 01:36:50.070
What happened here?

01:36:50.072 --> 01:36:53.274
Where...
where is my watch?

01:36:53.276 --> 01:36:55.509
What? What?

01:36:55.511 --> 01:36:57.812
What the fuck is this?

01:37:00.983 --> 01:37:02.449
Fuck! Fuck!

01:37:10.292 --> 01:37:12.259
Sir, we're looking
for Gabriella.

01:37:12.261 --> 01:37:15.462
- $50.
- There's been a mistake.

01:37:15.464 --> 01:37:17.104
You are not the Gabriella
we're looking...

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:21.101
- oh, yeah!
- Whoa!

01:37:21.103 --> 01:37:25.005
Who takes photos here?

01:37:25.007 --> 01:37:26.273
Run!

01:37:29.144 --> 01:37:31.478
- Oh, shit!
- Bring me back some weed.

01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.247
Across international borders?

01:37:33.249 --> 01:37:34.609
Stick it up your butt
or something.

01:37:49.564 --> 01:37:51.432
Trick or treat, bitches!
How sick is this?

01:37:52.869 --> 01:37:55.035
I'm a robot.
I'm a dance...

01:37:55.037 --> 01:37:56.036
stop!

01:37:56.038 --> 01:37:57.504
Dude, are you kidding me?

01:37:59.507 --> 01:38:02.042
- Logan: Hurry up, Princess!
- I gotta do my hair, dude!

01:38:02.044 --> 01:38:05.613
- I think you're ready!
- Oh, you piece of...

01:38:15.457 --> 01:38:17.224
Blake:
Oh, dude!

01:38:17.226 --> 01:38:18.893
What are you doing jerking off
in my parent's bedroom?

01:38:18.895 --> 01:38:20.261
Why are you walking in
without knocking?

01:38:20.263 --> 01:38:23.364
My mom's fitness videos?
Really?

01:38:23.366 --> 01:38:25.065
Logan: Dude, get your
dick away from me.

01:38:25.067 --> 01:38:26.367
Dude, seriously, stop it!

01:38:26.369 --> 01:38:28.202
Blake:
Just fucking touch it!

01:38:30.172 --> 01:38:31.171
Logan:
Did you just fart?

01:38:31.173 --> 01:38:33.374
Are you kidding me, dude?

01:38:33.376 --> 01:38:36.543
One, two..

01:38:36.545 --> 01:38:39.079
- We're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

01:38:39.081 --> 01:38:40.247
Okay.

01:38:40.249 --> 01:38:41.315
Pussy.

01:38:41.317 --> 01:38:42.449
Douchebag.

01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:44.385
Viva la Mexico?

01:38:44.387 --> 01:38:46.921
Aah!

01:38:46.923 --> 01:38:48.422
See you, bitch.
