01:28.708 --> 01:31.086
I was asking Till, I said you know,

01:31.087 --> 01:35.793
what's with all, you know, the fire
and everything about the fire

01:35.958 --> 01:37.631
where does this come from?

01:38.167 --> 01:40.545
And he looks at me and says:

01:40.958 --> 01:43.677
There are three kinds of fire!

01:43.833 --> 01:49.044
First is the fire of the mind,
your thoughts... Ok?!

01:49.667 --> 01:52.261
Second kind of fire is the
fire of the heart.

01:52.542 --> 01:55.091
It's your passion...

01:56.208 --> 01:58.802
and I am waiting for the third kind...

01:58.958 --> 02:02.292
and he says, then the third
kind of fire, it's just fire!

02:14.667 --> 02:18.968
They'd offered me earplugs.
Before they'd said, you will need these!

02:19.125 --> 02:21.041
And I am ah...

02:21.042 --> 02:24.342
So I used the earplugs,
it was still too loud...

02:24.500 --> 02:25.843
my body was shaking!

02:34.958 --> 02:39.509
When the fans are there it's your job
to give them bang for the buck.

02:39.667 --> 02:43.467
We are brothers in pyro! We
lead by fire.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.799
The first time I met Till,
he came into my dressing room on fire.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.092
That's a great entrance!

02:55.250 --> 02:57.673
We couldn't even shake hands,
because Till was on fire.

03:03.792 --> 03:07.001
I probably could have roasted
marshmallows from the seat I was in.

03:07.002 --> 03:08.377
And I wasn't in the front row.

03:08.542 --> 03:11.091
The production was over the
top! It was great!

03:20.708 --> 03:23.177
It's everything that Americans
think of Germany.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.631
It just runs, Germany,
it runs really well,

03:25.792 --> 03:27.715
like it's a very well oiled machine.

03:39.875 --> 03:46.167
It was an incredible display
of power and beauty,

03:46.375 --> 03:50.050
light and shade, entertainment.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.882
It was a rock opera!

03:58.792 --> 04:01.090
Their backstory is
unbelievably interesting!

04:01.250 --> 04:03.252
Six guys from behind the Iron Curtain

04:03.417 --> 04:06.045
who really did not believe they're ever
gonna have the opportunity

04:06.046 --> 04:08.340
to play the kind of music
that they are now playing.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.050
It'; The 1980s!
The East German music scene is small

04:13.208 --> 04:15.552
but active, and very tightly knit.

04:15.708 --> 04:18.382
Bands come and go,
everyone knows everyone else

04:18.541 --> 04:20.839
and there is a great sense of solidarity.

04:21.041 --> 04:23.261
On the road
with their former band 'Feeling B, '

04:23.417 --> 04:26.751
Paul Landers and Flake Lorenz
play every venue they're allowed to.

04:46.375 --> 04:50.130
Back then, it was normal
to play together with a lot of friends.

04:50.292 --> 04:53.296
If you had time,
you'd meet up and play together.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.711
'Feeling B' and 'Die
Firma' were still around

04:55.875 --> 04:57.798
so everyone had their own bands.

04:58.958 --> 05:02.542
Back then life for Paul and Flake
revolves around 'Feeling B.'

05:02.792 --> 05:06.046
Later they are joined
by drummer Christoph Schneider.

05:07.333 --> 05:11.167
In Schwerin Till Lindemann is playing
drums in the band 'First Arsch, '

05:11.333 --> 05:15.634
Richard Kruspe is with 'Das Elegante Chaos,
' and later 'Orgasm Death Gimmick, '

05:15.792 --> 05:18.796
while Oliver Riedel
is with 'The Inchtabokatables.'

05:18.958 --> 05:21.757
Their role models however
are predominantly Western.

05:22.083 --> 05:27.544
Because we could listen to radio, we had
the same radio broadcasts as West Germans.

05:27.708 --> 05:30.382
Radio Free Berlin had such great programs,

05:30.542 --> 05:34.172
and so musically we were
on the same level as the West,

05:34.375 --> 05:36.844
because music quickly crosses borders.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.800
And we knew the American bands, too.

05:51.625 --> 05:54.629
School, of course,
gave us a politically tinted view.

05:55.125 --> 05:59.426
The GDR tried to portray
the Soviet Union as good,

05:59.583 --> 06:02.553
and the West as bad, including America.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.676
It actually accomplished the opposite!

06:04.833 --> 06:11.375
I had a huge 'Kiss' poster
on my door at home,

06:11.542 --> 06:17.046
and one day my step-father came in and
ripped the poster into a thousand pieces.

06:17.047 --> 06:20.672
I spent the whole night
putting the pieces back together,

06:20.833 --> 06:23.302
and the next morning at about 5:30,
I was finished

06:23.458 --> 06:25.677
and could hang the poster back on my door.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.586
When they would be able to get their hands
on a tape, you know

06:28.750 --> 06:31.469
of a band, it was so...
It meant so much to them.

06:31.625 --> 06:37.052
So when the wall came down, obviously,
that enabled 'Rammstein' to even exist.

06:38.292 --> 06:44.046
In 1993, Schwerin friends Till, Richard and
Oliver celebrate their new found travel freedom

06:44.047 --> 06:47.046
with a voyage of discovery
across the south-western USA.

06:47.250 --> 06:51.130
Simultaneously 'Feeling B' are
visiting the south-eastern part of America.

06:51.958 --> 06:53.960
Blissfully unaware of
each other's existence,

06:54.125 --> 06:57.584
the future 'Rammstein' members
discover the formerly-forbidden country.

06:59.750 --> 07:03.675
We only knew America through films
and thought it was a dangerous country.

07:03.833 --> 07:09.636
We could speak school English,
but it wasn't enough for communication.

07:09.792 --> 07:12.511
The only one who could speak
a bit of English was Till.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.796
Oh could say â€œyes" and I could say "no,"
so we were a good team.

07:15.958 --> 07:20.134
Yeah, and it was terrible on the phone
when they towed our car.

07:20.292 --> 07:22.340
They were so inconsiderate,

07:22.500 --> 07:26.004
wouldn't speak a little slower,
it didn't work...

07:26.167 --> 07:29.717
We've taken your car away...
I didn't understand a word!

07:29.875 --> 07:32.958
Then they mentioned some kind of "fine,"
and I said: Is it fine?

07:33.125 --> 07:34.968
But they wanted money!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.177
Till, Oliver and Richard's traveling party

07:40.333 --> 07:43.047
don't allow themselves
to be waylaid by such problems

07:43.048 --> 07:44.885
and continue to enjoy the new world.

07:46.958 --> 07:50.132
Paul, Schneider and Flake however
take it a step further,

07:50.417 --> 07:55.674
and try to top up their depleted vacation
fund with occasional performances.

07:57.542 --> 08:01.592
When we were in New Orleans it was
Mardi Gras, which is carnival for us.

08:01.750 --> 08:07.462
There were bands playing in every bar,
there was areal party atmosphere.

08:07.750 --> 08:11.550
Then we said we'd may, too,
and suddenly the whole venue was empty!

08:11.708 --> 08:13.836
No one came in, everyone just ran out.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.301
I remember how Schneider
asked the drummer, can I play on your kit?

08:18.458 --> 08:21.382
Then the drummer looked
at Schneider's sticks,

08:21.542 --> 08:23.636
they were quite thick,

08:23.792 --> 08:27.001
and gave him two thin ones, right?

08:27.167 --> 08:28.714
He was completely over the moon.

08:28.875 --> 08:32.083
Then he gave me his sticks and I had
to keep playing with the thin ones.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.092
And he asked me not to play too hard.

08:39.292 --> 08:41.794
This American adventure
is more than just a journey

08:41.957 --> 08:44.381
through the land of
seemingly unlimited possibilities.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.843
It is also a turning point.

08:49.792 --> 08:53.717
At that time,
we were a little bit directionless.

08:53.875 --> 08:56.594
We still had the bands
that we had in the East,

08:56.750 --> 08:59.674
but we knew that we might want
to start something new.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.835
It was a kind of crossroad.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.630
For all of us, independently of each other
and both groups,

09:05.792 --> 09:10.969
seeing how music was made here, was
an inspiration that we took back to Europe.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.423
We saw that in California,

09:13.583 --> 09:17.338
there were two people in L.A.,
on Sunset Strip,

09:17.500 --> 09:19.673
listening to this band playing.

09:19.833 --> 09:23.417
They were kind of awesome in a way,
it sounded good,

09:23.583 --> 09:26.302
at least to our East German ears.

09:26.458 --> 09:31.041
There were two people in the pit,

09:31.042 --> 09:37.129
and then the band started, and they acted like
they were playing for ten thousand people.

09:37.292 --> 09:40.626
They went crazy!
I said, what'; Wrong with them?

09:40.792 --> 09:42.465
You can't go on stage like that!

09:42.625 --> 09:44.609
Because we always thought,
at the youth club,

09:44.635 --> 09:46.575
when a band plays there,
it's always packed,

09:46.708 --> 09:48.710
or there are at least a few people there.

09:48.958 --> 09:51.757
Two people! I didn't understand
why they would even start?!

09:51.917 --> 09:54.044
I thought that this is the American way,

09:54.045 --> 09:56.795
to always give one hundred percent
no matter what.

09:56.958 --> 09:59.632
I noticed that music
is more important to people here,

09:59.833 --> 10:01.756
because they have to live from it.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.594
We're from the GDR and
it was like paradise,

10:04.750 --> 10:08.002
you lived your life
and then played music on the side for fun,

10:08.003 --> 10:09.798
because there was always money.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.927
Here, people who make music are dependent
on it and therefore take it more seriously.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.008
Lives led in East Germany
and experiences gained in America...

10:20.750 --> 10:23.344
These are the foundations
on which 'Rammstein is built.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.676
The musicians also view their new band

10:25.875 --> 10:28.719
as a reaction to the situation
in the reunified Germany.

10:31.125 --> 10:35.756
We didn't want 'Rammstein'
to sound like American bands!

10:35.917 --> 10:39.922
But we adopted the energy
of the approach for our band.

10:57.042 --> 11:00.342
We conceptualized the
band to stir things up!

11:00.500 --> 11:03.094
We'd done it already
with our bands in the East,

11:03.250 --> 11:06.220
and 'Rammstein' happens
to be just what the West needs.

11:21.083 --> 11:24.667
We were never allowed to say anything,
that's how it was in the East.

11:24.833 --> 11:28.508
The problem was always
that certain topics couldn't be addressed.

11:28.667 --> 11:32.717
In music, for example,
the lyrics would be vague or in English

11:32.875 --> 11:34.798
so that no one could understand them.

11:34.958 --> 11:39.668
Then all of a sudden you have the opportunity
to say and sing whatever you want.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.256
Even do some of the things
you want to on stage,

11:42.417 --> 11:45.170
and of course in that moment
you scream it from your soul.

11:56.750 --> 12:01.130
Basically, we do what many people
would like to do.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.959
And you get the angriest about
the mistakes you'd like to make yourself.

12:06.500 --> 12:11.961
Basically, we rustle all the
feathers we can here in Germany,

12:12.250 --> 12:16.505
and people get angry
because they don't dare do it themselves.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.094
I think it's good that
'Rammstein' polarises.

12:30.095 --> 12:37.592
I like it when a band
provokes people into discussing the topic.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.468
I think it's good in general.

12:39.625 --> 12:44.051
People thinking about certain things and
then maybe even realizing where they stand,

12:44.208 --> 12:46.210
and what their own opinion is.

12:53.417 --> 12:56.138
We started as a completely normal band.
We just played.

12:56.164 --> 12:57.572
There were no show elements.

13:02.708 --> 13:05.461
Till actually saw us in Berlin 1994.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.424
He said, he was at that show
and for him and his friends,

13:08.583 --> 13:11.553
it was like one of the most
important shows they ever went to,

13:11.708 --> 13:13.301
and he said especially 'Anthrax, '

13:13.458 --> 13:17.543
because he had never seen a band
moving so much and trying to entertain

13:17.708 --> 13:20.336
and he said, it was
really, really inï¬‚uential on them,

13:20.500 --> 13:23.003
when they were first
putting 'Rammstein' together,

13:23.167 --> 13:25.420
thinking we want to entertain people.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.757
American audiences,
Western audiences like to be entertained!

13:28.917 --> 13:32.547
There is a long history
of entertainment from the West,

13:32.750 --> 13:35.253
starting from Elvis Presley and...

13:35.417 --> 13:40.753
but it has to have, for longevity,
it has to have some substance behind it.

13:40.917 --> 13:43.511
I know that 'Kiss, ' I am sure
was a big influence on them

13:43.667 --> 13:44.759
as they were with me.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.510
They were my heroes.

13:46.667 --> 13:51.503
The first band that introduced
certain special effects into their shows

13:51.667 --> 13:54.750
like pyrotechnics etc.,
I'd never seen that before.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.052
'Rammstein's stage show
is constantly evolving.

14:00.708 --> 14:04.667
Pyrotechnics quickly become an
integral part of their performances.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.636
Before long the band
is reaching an ever-greater audience.

14:11.042 --> 14:14.296
'Rammstein' now play major festivals
with international line-ups,

14:14.625 --> 14:17.469
and many American acts
become aware of the German band.

14:28.667 --> 14:34.549
I remember being
somewhere in Europe and hearing

14:35.875 --> 14:43.418
bubbling commentary about a new
important German group called 'Rammstein.'

14:44.333 --> 14:48.338
And it rang a strange bell,
what is 'Rammstein', 'Rammstein?'?

14:48.500 --> 14:54.257
"Stein" of course is German for "stone"
and "ramm," to "ram" is a verb in English,

14:54.417 --> 14:58.752
it'; An aggressive verb.
It means to push through

14:58.917 --> 15:00.760
and with aggressive force

15:00.917 --> 15:05.093
but I'd heard something else
and all of a sudden, I realized...

15:06.667 --> 15:10.999
Ramstein is the big American base

15:11.000 --> 15:17.963
and I thought, oh! Somebody put
their finger on the belly button.

15:23.458 --> 15:26.587
I remember,
we saw them in 1997 on this festival,

15:26.750 --> 15:30.002
And he was shooting
that ï¬‚amethrower out over the crowd

15:30.003 --> 15:32.628
and I remember going:
You can't do this at home!!

15:36.292 --> 15:43.710
We played at festivals in Germany
where international bands played, too.

15:43.875 --> 15:48.335
After the concert, they'd come
to us and say: You have to come over!

15:48.500 --> 15:50.218
And we always thought, what? Really?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.377
We sing in German,
no one is interested in that!

15:54.458 --> 15:56.005
Feedback from international artists,

15:56.167 --> 15:58.340
and their rising
popularity in Germany and beyond,

15:58.542 --> 16:01.233
spur 'Rammstein' on to
take the next step.

16:01.259 --> 16:04.074
The band wants to crack
the American market.

16:23.208 --> 16:26.132
The path from Germany
to America just doesn't exist.

16:26.292 --> 16:29.136
There's only the path
from America and England to Germany.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.131
There aren't even telephone lines.

16:31.292 --> 16:33.044
They don't even have the numbers!

16:33.208 --> 16:36.257
They just get called up
and told what to release.

16:37.042 --> 16:40.672
In their search for a suitable American
partner they come across Bob Biggs,

16:40.833 --> 16:43.461
founder of the
independent label 'Slash Records.'

16:43.958 --> 16:45.551
He has experience
of working with acts

16:45.708 --> 16:48.382
like 'Faith No More'
and 'Asian Dub Foundation.'

16:48.792 --> 16:51.636
Biggs decides to take a gamble
on 'Rammstein, ' and says yes.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.254
I came from a punk rock
background, I think.

16:56.417 --> 17:01.799
And I mean, the stuff that the bands
that I had were doing, was, you know...

17:01.958 --> 17:06.338
it wasn't as slick
and as produced and as good.

17:06.541 --> 17:08.795
But they were doing crazy things on stage.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.003
To understand 'Rammstein, '
you have to see 'Rammstein' live.

17:12.005 --> 17:14.878
That's why we invited him back then,

17:15.041 --> 17:17.840
and he came to see us
play at the 'Bizarre Festival'...

17:18.416 --> 17:21.090
At the time,
I had pretty much complete autonomy!

17:21.250 --> 17:23.377
I could do whatever I wanted to do,

17:24.916 --> 17:28.626
and when I first started
talking about 'Rammstein, '

17:28.792 --> 17:31.966
it wasn't really popular
within the company.

17:33.917 --> 17:38.718
Biggs is particularly fascinated by their
stage production as a total work of art.

17:41.042 --> 17:44.467
He saw it and then fell
in love with the band,

17:44.625 --> 17:50.132
and, of course, with his motivation
he accomplished a lot of things we needed.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.758
In this country, you need someone
who believes in you.

17:53.917 --> 17:58.082
And then, we brought them over to New York

17:58.083 --> 18:01.166
to play a couple of gigs,
just to get them introduced.

18:06.292 --> 18:09.298
In September 1997 the
time has finally come!

18:09.324 --> 18:11.995
'Rammstein's American
adventure begins.

18:21.292 --> 18:26.048
European success counts for little here.
America is a totally different market,

18:26.208 --> 18:29.257
in which it is difficult
for European bands to get a foothold.

18:29.542 --> 18:34.423
So, in New York,
'Rammstein' start again from scratch.

18:40.083 --> 18:43.667
This is the location
where we played for the first time.

18:43.875 --> 18:47.505
The venue was called 'Banks'
because it used to be an old bank.

18:47.667 --> 18:52.844
I recall that we played
here for about 15 people.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.301
We were playing this festival
called the 'College Music Festival.'

18:57.458 --> 19:02.168
And then, we heard a band called 'Rammstein'
was going to play the same night

19:02.333 --> 19:06.213
and we were very excited going,
who is this band from Germany?

19:06.417 --> 19:09.796
Wait a minute!
We sing in German, they sing in German.

19:09.958 --> 19:12.632
This is awesome.
We have to hang out with them, right?

19:12.792 --> 19:17.047
We sat on our gear
in the hallway when 'Rammstein' arrived.

19:17.208 --> 19:20.462
And all of them appeared
at that time to be about eight feet tall.

19:20.625 --> 19:26.553
And they just filed in one by one
in front of us, walking stoically.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.676
They came in with a smoke machine.

19:28.833 --> 19:32.042
It was like the sun was
behind them, they came in like shadows!

19:32.208 --> 19:35.004
The smoke machine
and we sat there and went like...

19:35.005 --> 19:38.550
I remember, back then,
we always started with the burning jacket.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.507
I remember that Till
set himself on fire out here,

19:41.708 --> 19:44.678
and then walked
through the venue to get to the stage.

19:44.833 --> 19:48.042
Because we didn't have a backstage
area to prepare the pyrotechnics.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.631
'Rammstein' went on considerably late

19:50.833 --> 19:54.292
and played to
about 30 people, two of which were us.

19:54.458 --> 19:59.840
Of course, we waited around
and we were just, it was just like...

20:00.000 --> 20:04.836
It was insane, it was
an arena show in a bar, it was a barena!

20:35.875 --> 20:38.958
Bob had said to me,
you need to go check out this band!

20:39.125 --> 20:41.378
They are gonna be
a very big priority for you!

20:41.542 --> 20:44.967
You're gonna have to work this and
we're putting this album out in January!

20:45.958 --> 20:49.542
And I remember watching
this and seeing this

20:49.750 --> 20:53.505
and saying to myself:
This is it? This is the big priority?

20:55.875 --> 20:58.594
The German band's
show causes jaws to drop.

20:59.375 --> 21:02.709
The press now take notice of the six
lads from the fallen East Germany,

21:03.042 --> 21:06.012
not least of all due to
the band's extreme physical exertion.

21:07.542 --> 21:11.217
Back then,
we had a song that we played called...

21:12.792 --> 21:13.964
what was it called again?

21:14.125 --> 21:15.468
â€œIch tu dir weh."
â€œFeuerrÃ©ider."

21:15.625 --> 21:17.548
No, "Feuerrader!"
Yeah! That's what I meant.

21:18.417 --> 21:23.503
That was the performance
where Flake rode around on Till for a while

21:23.708 --> 21:26.302
with a neon tube
in his hand, and then, for the finale,

21:26.458 --> 21:30.838
would basically shatter it
into a thousand pieces on Till's back.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.082
German neon tubes are thin
and very easy to break.

21:36.083 --> 21:41.510
But Flake didn't know that American neon
tubes are about three to four times thicker

21:41.667 --> 21:43.385
and not as easily shattered.

21:43.542 --> 21:48.082
Exactly! So he went nuts
trying to break it on Till's back.

21:48.083 --> 21:51.004
Poor Till almost couldn't
handle it anymore,

21:51.005 --> 21:55.801
and at the end it didn't really shatter,
it just broke into two pieces.

21:55.958 --> 22:02.671
The other piece ï¬‚ew at me while I was playing
and suddenly it was stuck in my shoulder!

22:02.833 --> 22:05.552
And then we all went out onto the street

22:05.708 --> 22:09.417
where Till and I bled like crazy.

22:09.583 --> 22:13.417
Till'; Back looked really bad!
It was full of shards.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.301
That was our first show in America.

22:15.458 --> 22:18.667
It was like trial by fire!
We're seeing it live in a small club

22:18.833 --> 22:22.463
with them playing and smashing
ï¬‚uorescent lights across each other.

22:22.667 --> 22:26.092
I left and I just remember
walking out shaking my head and saying:

22:26.250 --> 22:30.175
What am I gonna do with these guys?
How is this gonna work?

22:30.375 --> 22:33.504
Listen to the band! It
didn't really matter!

22:33.667 --> 22:39.424
I mean the trilling of
the German like an opera singer,

22:39.667 --> 22:44.252
and the way it came out and the attack that
it had and the point that the music had,

22:44.417 --> 22:48.797
was so aggressive and so, so, so striking!

22:48.958 --> 22:51.047
I didn't really care what was going on.

22:51.048 --> 22:54.251
It didn't matter to me,
I just thought it was wonderful stuff.

22:59.583 --> 23:02.587
A mere three months
later, in December 1997,

23:02.750 --> 23:08.712
'Rammstein' embark upon their first major U.S.
tour, supporting the industrial band 'KMFDM.'

23:31.583 --> 23:34.462
Pyrotechnics are
'Rammstein's trump card at this point.

23:35.542 --> 23:38.842
I ï¬‚ew out to come and see the band,
to see them perform,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.844
to see them really let loose.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.002
I'll never forget, the show ended.

23:44.003 --> 23:49.211
The end of the show, Till held out the
ï¬‚amethrower and was blowing ï¬‚ames,

23:49.375 --> 23:53.960
it couldn't have been more than 25
or 30 feet over the crowds head

23:54.125 --> 23:56.719
and I saw the reaction of the crowd.

23:56.875 --> 24:01.255
And I remember leaving that show
that night and realizing this could work!

24:01.417 --> 24:05.297
So that was the next step
for me to sort of believing

24:05.500 --> 24:08.299
and seeing what 'Rammstein'
could really ultimately achieve.

24:11.042 --> 24:14.967
The band still lack an American agent
who can book shows for them in the U.S.

24:15.875 --> 24:19.550
As a result Wayne Pighini
has to do an awful lot of persuading.

24:22.292 --> 24:26.001
He had called me and said, we are
looking for an agent for this band

24:26.002 --> 24:28.001
and I think you would be perfect.

24:28.002 --> 24:29.547
Your company represents 'Metallica, '

24:29.708 --> 24:31.836
you've some
of the biggest artists in the world,

24:32.000 --> 24:37.586
but my initial instinct was,
that this will never, ever work in America.

24:37.750 --> 24:41.254
So I called Wayne
and I said, I'm passing, I'm out,

24:41.417 --> 24:43.260
it's never gonna happen here!

24:43.417 --> 24:46.626
Americans will never listen
to a band that sings in German.

24:47.333 --> 24:50.416
And he wouldn't give up! So I said, OK!

24:50.583 --> 24:52.585
Listen! I'm gonna go see the show.

24:53.292 --> 24:58.041
So I went to Los Angeles,
I walked into the Palladium,

24:58.042 --> 24:59.009
'Rammstein' comes out,

25:02.375 --> 25:06.926
Till has his arms open with the
metal jacket, completely on fire...

25:10.167 --> 25:12.420
I looked at Wayne and I said, I'm in!

25:12.958 --> 25:18.169
This is so extreme, this is so real,
that America will eat this up!

25:18.792 --> 25:24.046
The biggest dream for every band from Europe
or Germany is to be successful in America.

25:24.047 --> 25:28.673
If you're then lucky enough
to gain that success in your own language

25:28.833 --> 25:30.676
without having to imitate anything,

25:30.833 --> 25:34.258
if you can stay true
to yourself, your music and language,

25:34.417 --> 25:36.294
you feel even better, of course.

25:42.958 --> 25:46.417
That'; Why these concerts
were incredibly important to us.

25:46.583 --> 25:51.544
That we managed, after a certain time, after
we'd already been successful in Germany,

25:51.708 --> 25:55.042
to do concerts here with 'Rammstein.'

25:55.208 --> 25:59.839
Because we just knew that our show,
the pyrotechnics and everything,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.085
would also be well received in America,
regardless of whether we sang in German,

26:04.250 --> 26:07.959
we knew that it was definitely worth
trying to come here with 'Rammstein.'

26:12.000 --> 26:15.459
So it's possible that someone would go
to a 'Rammstein' show in the States

26:15.625 --> 26:18.549
and have no interest
in guitar-based music or heavy metal,

26:18.708 --> 26:21.336
but they just love
the fireworks and the spectacle.

26:21.500 --> 26:26.085
The first headline tour that
we booked for 'Rammstein' across the U.S.,

26:26.250 --> 26:31.461
we did San Francisco,
L.A., Denver, Chicago and New York.

26:31.625 --> 26:33.999
It's 1,200 miles to Denver!

26:34.000 --> 26:34.751
From where?

26:34.917 --> 26:36.919
From L.A.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.094
Maybe we should leave earlier.

26:44.667 --> 26:52.667
Presale! Denver 464!
Chicago 740! Presale! 740!

26:52.875 --> 26:56.334
Fucking beautiful!
520 New York City!

26:56.500 --> 27:02.633
Two weeks left! Looking good! Very good.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.502
Kids were coming to the show,

27:06.667 --> 27:10.376
knowing that they were gonna see an
incredible, intense show with pyrotechnics!

27:10.542 --> 27:13.751
And the band
was challenged every day by the authorities

27:13.917 --> 27:16.090
as to what they could do or couldn't do.

27:31.292 --> 27:35.342
<i>When we were</i> in <i>Chicago in 1998,
the fire department</i> came <i>down to the</i> show

27:35.500 --> 27:38.299
and they told them
they were not allowed to do fire!

27:38.500 --> 27:43.256
And they were like: Oh, my God!
How we gonna do a show, without FEUER?!

27:50.583 --> 27:54.042
So the band had two choices! One: Go home!

27:54.208 --> 27:56.461
Two: Do a show with no pyro!

27:58.250 --> 28:00.719
So they said: Fuck it!
There's 1,100 people here,

28:00.875 --> 28:03.424
we're gonna play without pyro
and we're gonna kick some ass!

28:04.875 --> 28:07.048
We didn't know that almost every type

28:07.208 --> 28:10.417
of pyrotechnics needed
to be inspected for permission!

28:18.375 --> 28:25.714
One of the drawbacks is that everyone here
in America takes their job so seriously!

28:25.875 --> 28:29.800
150 percent seriously,
and you have to show them everything.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.381
Even to this day, the band will not play,

28:32.542 --> 28:35.087
cannot play in the city limits of Chicago,

28:35.088 --> 28:38.713
because they had massive fires
way back in the early 1900s.

28:44.708 --> 28:48.838
But the band receive surprising support
of a very different kind from Hollywood.

28:49.458 --> 28:53.041
Visionary director David Lynch
uses two of their songs

28:53.042 --> 28:55.340
in his now-legendary film 'Lost Highway.'

29:21.708 --> 29:25.292
Lynch was definitely a door-opener.

29:25.458 --> 29:29.543
A door opened for us
into that style of art.

29:29.750 --> 29:33.550
All these intellectuals,
noticed us for the first time.

29:33.708 --> 29:36.552
I mean, Manson was involved.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.962
Trent Reznor of 'Nine Inch Nails'
did the soundtrack back then,

29:40.125 --> 29:42.548
so it was a good soundtrack
with Lynch, yeah.

29:54.708 --> 29:57.052
I was playing a prisoner in the jail scene.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.427
Henry Rollins was the prison guard.

29:59.583 --> 30:05.005
So during that scene on the set David Lynch
was playing this music to set the mood.

30:05.006 --> 30:08.254
Because he wanted it to be
very dark and very scary.

30:08.417 --> 30:11.041
Start the music quiet!

30:11.042 --> 30:15.343
And then, when it hits the quiet part of the
music, we'll crank it up on action, OK?!

30:17.000 --> 30:20.550
So he starts playing
this song: "Rammstein!â€œ"

30:33.042 --> 30:34.510
I never heard it before!

30:34.667 --> 30:38.592
He's playing this really evil heavy music
with some guy with this voice

30:38.750 --> 30:42.050
and singing in German!
And I am like, this is fucked up!

30:42.208 --> 30:45.758
I'm sitting in this weird jail cell
and I've never been in a movie before,

30:45.917 --> 30:49.342
so I was nervous anyway
and the music just made me more nervous

30:49.500 --> 30:52.089
and that was the point.
David Lynch was like:

30:52.090 --> 30:55.337
I want everyone to look really nervous
and scared, and the music did it!

30:55.500 --> 30:58.674
And then I asked afterwards.
I said, what'; That music you're playing?

30:58.833 --> 31:02.588
He goes: They're this German band
called 'Rammstein!' Isn't it great?!

31:04.208 --> 31:08.384
I mean certainly
having 'Rammstein' in 'Lost Highway'

31:08.542 --> 31:12.718
was the introduction
that 'Rammstein' had to a lot of Americans.

31:12.917 --> 31:16.592
I think, they still
would have had success without that,

31:16.750 --> 31:22.553
but it's such an amazing scene
and the music works so perfectly.

31:39.125 --> 31:42.629
You know, it's hard to imagine
that scene with any other music in there.

32:04.042 --> 32:07.467
I was involved with
David Lynch making 'Lost Highway'

32:08.208 --> 32:13.009
and I had heard some music
that he was considering using for the film

32:13.167 --> 32:16.751
and for some reason, he had asked me
about 'Rammstein'.

32:16.917 --> 32:22.999
And it ended up being in the sex scene
when fucking somebody: Patricia Arquette.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.001
So that's where it first started with,

32:25.002 --> 32:28.709
so I hopefully had a part
of the suggestion to David Lynch

32:28.875 --> 32:30.969
because I was such a fan of the song.

32:51.583 --> 32:55.668
At that point, David Lynch
and Trent Reznor were like demigods.

32:55.833 --> 32:58.837
And so David Lynch and Trent Reznor
saying that they liked 'Rammstein'

32:59.000 --> 33:01.970
suddenly made it OK for everyone else
in America to like 'Rammstein.'

33:02.125 --> 33:05.504
Cut it! Good deal!

33:07.667 --> 33:08.668
We're there, man!

33:08.833 --> 33:14.135
I think we gained
a lot of hardcore fans at that time.

33:14.292 --> 33:19.719
People that listened to that type of music,
not the mainstream public.

33:19.875 --> 33:25.041
But these were the first fans
to notice 'Rammstein' in America.

33:25.042 --> 33:27.261
So, the first American
interview they did here

33:27.417 --> 33:29.966
was with a major
fashion magazine, was with 'Details?

33:30.125 --> 33:32.048
And I knew it was the right thing to do,

33:32.208 --> 33:36.041
as soon as people started calling up
and saying: How the fuck did that happen?

33:36.042 --> 33:40.172
I was just working on these things, like
I wanted them to be in 'Details' or 'GQ'

33:40.333 --> 33:43.052
or 'Esquire' or 'Vanity Fair'
first before anything else

33:43.053 --> 33:45.591
and 'MTV' started getting into them,

33:45.750 --> 33:49.584
ready to do some sort of
Headbangers' Ball rock thing

33:49.750 --> 33:53.129
and I said, no, I didn't wanna do it
until Kurt Loder did it himself

33:53.292 --> 33:55.670
and I also knew that
Kurt Loder spoke German.

33:56.458 --> 33:59.462
Metal isn't a musical combination
one comes across every day.

33:59.625 --> 34:02.299
When the German band 'Rammstein'
passed through New York recently,

34:02.458 --> 34:04.802
in ï¬‚ames literally,
we had to catch their act.

34:04.958 --> 34:07.211
The group is fronted by
an Olympic swimming champ,

34:07.375 --> 34:09.045
oddly enough has already been featured

34:09.045 --> 34:11.170
on a soundtrack
of David Lynch's film 'Lost Highway'

34:11.333 --> 34:12.380
and doesn't speak English.

34:12.542 --> 34:16.172
So in a tribute to Raymond Burr's placed-in
appearance in the original 'Godzilla'

34:16.333 --> 34:19.757
we dusted off our rusty German and
pretaped some questions to put to the boys.

34:19.917 --> 34:21.965
It seemed like a good idea, but let's see.

34:22.125 --> 34:25.254
Good evening, gentlemen.
So tell me what's going on with the fire?

34:25.417 --> 34:28.545
There's fire in the videos and fire
on stage, what's up with that?

34:28.708 --> 34:32.007
It's important to have
something more than just for your ears,

34:32.167 --> 34:34.795
because that's what you
get on the CD at home.

34:34.958 --> 34:39.134
It was always my experience
that when I went to a concert,

34:39.292 --> 34:42.670
I wanted to see something other
than the music.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.050
Isn't that dangerous?

34:44.208 --> 34:50.375
Only minor things have happened to us,
like light to moderate burns sometimes,

34:50.542 --> 34:53.625
some singed hair
and maybe a burnt ear and...

35:05.917 --> 35:09.044
those guys 'Rammstein.'
Please don't try this at home, kids!

35:09.045 --> 35:10.214
Guitars can be dangerous!

35:10.458 --> 35:14.543
At the time, the music scene was
the 'Spice Girls' and stuff like that.

35:14.708 --> 35:16.585
It was 'Hanson, ' it was terrible!

35:16.750 --> 35:21.677
And it was also this new metal scene with
'Korn' and 'Linkin Park' and those guys.

35:21.833 --> 35:24.131
'Korn' and 'Linkin Park' were
pretty powerful bands,

35:24.292 --> 35:27.375
but they weren't as interesting to look at
as 'Rammstein' was.

35:27.542 --> 35:32.002
They were just very theatrical sort of
like 'Kiss' in away.

35:32.167 --> 35:36.468
So they were much more interesting I thought
and they knew exactly what they were doing.

35:36.625 --> 35:40.129
Till is a great singer.
And I just loved it,

35:40.292 --> 35:43.546
"I love â€œDu Hast" and I love that album,
it's really great.

35:53.167 --> 35:56.250
Hard heavy music, metal,
whatever you want to call it,

35:56.417 --> 35:58.465
was really on an upswing at that time

35:58.625 --> 36:02.835
in the form of bands like 'Limp Bizkit,
' 'Korn, ' 'System of a Down, '

36:03.000 --> 36:04.968
'Tool, ' 'Rage Against the Machine, '

36:05.125 --> 36:09.756
these bands at that time were starting
to become really popular mainstream

36:09.917 --> 36:12.261
and radio had to support that.

36:12.417 --> 36:16.001
Again these bands
were just getting too big outside of radio

36:16.167 --> 36:21.469
and that whole movement
of heavy bands really sort of had dictated

36:21.625 --> 36:24.344
a new direction for radio stations.

36:30.917 --> 36:37.209
Alternative radio in the States was
'jewel' and 'The Wallï¬‚owers'

36:37.375 --> 36:40.629
and was very lighthearted.

36:40.792 --> 36:44.751
And then almost over night,
it became 'Metallica, ' 'Limp Bizkit, '

36:44.917 --> 36:48.842
'Puddle of Mudd, ' 'Disturbed'
and 'Rammstein' fit perfectly into that.

36:56.625 --> 37:00.459
The only other German band
we really knew was 'The Scorpions' before.

37:00.625 --> 37:03.003
And, you know, they always sang in English.

37:03.004 --> 37:08.382
So it was very interesting to see
this band playing such heavy, heavy music

37:08.542 --> 37:09.964
and singing in German,

37:10.125 --> 37:13.049
and American kids loving it, they loved it.

37:13.250 --> 37:17.505
Because think about it,
before that it was "99 Luftballons.â€œ".

37:17.667 --> 37:21.797
So you got, it was 'Nena, ' 'Rammstein.'

37:37.208 --> 37:43.750
it seems like every decade, there is one
German song that is incredibly pervasive.

37:43.958 --> 37:49.510
And it seems like this country allows only
one German song per decade to be a hit.

37:49.667 --> 37:53.752
'Rammstein' were fortunate enough
to get the 90s.

37:57.167 --> 38:00.501
'Rammstein's single â€œDu Hast"
becomes that hit song.

38:00.958 --> 38:03.256
Even the smallest radio stations play it.

38:03.875 --> 38:08.210
'Rammstein' have managed something that has
eluded almost all other German artists -

38:08.625 --> 38:10.047
they've broken America.

38:10.625 --> 38:14.082
I'm from a very small town
in the United States.

38:14.083 --> 38:17.166
It's very unexpected that
they would even play the song.

38:17.333 --> 38:23.591
And I remember right away,
I loved the production, the sound

38:23.750 --> 38:27.835
and I remember I had to
ask someone right away what that meant.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.507
And I felt anytime
someone has to question art,

38:33.667 --> 38:36.637
it means something to you!

38:36.792 --> 38:38.965
It doesn't pass you right by!

38:52.583 --> 38:55.632
At the time MTV was very important.

38:55.792 --> 38:59.046
You had to be on MTV! So, 'cause
then your fans can see who you are.

38:59.208 --> 39:02.792
They wanted to crack this market obviously.
They wanted to be big in America!

39:02.958 --> 39:10.082
Be afraid, be very afraid, if you love
having the holy crap scared out of you,

39:10.083 --> 39:13.292
and I know I do, then you
are gonna love this!

39:13.458 --> 39:18.669
Performing "DU HAST",
oh my sweet lord, it's 'RAMMSTEIN!!'

39:41.125 --> 39:44.504
Once U.S. radio got a hold of it
and saw the reaction

39:44.667 --> 39:46.635
and how it worked and MTV played it,

39:46.792 --> 39:52.549
it just continued to snowball
and it was everywhere.

39:52.708 --> 39:56.383
I remember a friend of mine at MTV called
me up and said, oh hey,

39:56.542 --> 40:01.127
they passed on this third 'Smashing Pumpkins'
video of whatever the album was at that time

40:01.292 --> 40:03.135
and they're giving the spot to your hand.

40:03.292 --> 40:05.465
I was like what band? Like 'Rammstein, '

40:05.625 --> 40:07.923
they're gonna put "Du Hast"
into heavy rotation.

40:08.292 --> 40:11.136
I had just left 'Hole, ' just joined
'The Smashing Pumpkins'

40:11.292 --> 40:15.502
and I remember james Iha,
the guitar player in the Pumpkins,

40:15.667 --> 40:20.218
during like between songs just started
going "du, du hast, du hast mich"

40:20.375 --> 40:23.834
and got the whole crowd to chant
and that was my introduction,

40:24.000 --> 40:28.085
was through the guitar player of 'Smashing
Pumpkins' doing an a cappella chant.

41:57.125 --> 42:00.834
One of the greatest things I remember,
was walking into a strip club

42:01.000 --> 42:02.718
and I don't frequent strip clubs,

42:02.875 --> 42:07.551
but when I heard "Du Hast"
at the strip club, I knew the band made it.

42:08.500 --> 42:13.506
Boosted by this success, the album "Sehnsucht"
climbs into the American Billboard Top 50 -

42:13.750 --> 42:16.833
a massive success
for a German band with German lyrics.

42:17.167 --> 42:19.465
In the summer of 1998 'Rammstein, '

42:19.625 --> 42:21.969
in conjunction
with some of America's hottest bands,

42:22.125 --> 42:24.219
launch the 'Family Values Tour.'

42:24.833 --> 42:28.588
Every town we went to at first,
the people all stood like this!

42:28.750 --> 42:29.876
What is that?

42:45.500 --> 42:49.130
The 'Family Values' name was
kind of like this group of bands.

42:49.292 --> 42:52.751
Ironically 'Rammstein' was really
the black sheep in that group,

42:52.917 --> 42:57.468
they really had nothing to do with those
bands other then being classified in the.

42:57.625 --> 43:03.041
U.S. music marketing
machine as a metal band.

43:03.042 --> 43:06.251
It was always encouraging
to play with these cool bands,

43:06.417 --> 43:09.296
because we really had
the creme de la creme.

43:09.458 --> 43:15.591
They set quite a high standard
and we could only just keep up.

43:15.750 --> 43:19.505
Or let's put it this way,
it was a good measuring stick for us.

43:19.667 --> 43:23.044
Because it's easy
to be the king back home in Germany.

43:23.045 --> 43:27.252
But to keep up internationally,
that's something else entirely!

43:50.792 --> 43:55.082
They were embraced in this group,
in this tour

43:55.083 --> 44:00.795
which was built as 'Family Values' because at
the time "Du Hastâ€œ was exploding in the U.S."

44:30.667 --> 44:34.672
I think we were supposed
to play third or second, in the lead-up.

44:35.875 --> 44:40.335
Then we told our management:
We won't play second out of five bands!

44:40.500 --> 44:43.583
We'll play second to last!
We want to play right before 'Korn!'

44:43.750 --> 44:47.050
And 'Limp Bizkit' was lethal!
So lethal live, really!

44:47.051 --> 44:48.919
They went off!

45:01.417 --> 45:06.127
We felt really shabby! We thought,
they're cool, hard, make awesome music,

45:06.292 --> 45:08.715
and we've snuck in, unjustified,

45:08.875 --> 45:11.845
and are trying to mask it
with a few ï¬‚amethrowers!

45:20.792 --> 45:25.423
Their music is heavy,
but it almost sounds military,

45:25.583 --> 45:33.126
almost sounds like a squadron
of military musicians has come on stage.

45:41.167 --> 45:44.671
I don't think the audience really knew
what hit them over their head.

45:44.833 --> 45:49.634
It felt like sort of this band coming on

45:49.792 --> 45:53.126
with fire and destruction and death

45:53.292 --> 45:56.067
and by the time it was over,
it was like: "What happened?

45:56.093 --> 45:57.527
What just happened to us?!â€œ."

45:57.667 --> 46:01.217
It was complete entertainment,
the whole time from start to finish!

46:09.417 --> 46:12.131
I remember that on the
'Family Values Tour',

46:12.157 --> 46:14.448
I had a huge problem
just being there

46:14.583 --> 46:17.006
because I couldn't speak a word of English!

46:17.167 --> 46:19.465
So I closed myself off.

46:19.625 --> 46:22.094
I thought it was such a shame,
because I wanted to,

46:22.292 --> 46:24.966
I mean we were playing
with bands that we all liked.

46:25.125 --> 46:28.174
But I never had the chance to communicate!

46:28.333 --> 46:33.590
I was very introverted there, and I suffered
a lot because I couldn't speak the language.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.161
It was strange for us,
the first time them coming over,

46:36.250 --> 46:38.850
we're going to the dressing room
and they're having a table set up

46:39.000 --> 46:40.718
and they'll have a traditional dinner set,

46:40.875 --> 46:43.355
they were all sitting like
eating together at a table and like:

46:43.458 --> 46:45.418
"What the hell is going on
in this dressing room?"

46:47.500 --> 46:49.594
It was very hard to
communicate with the band.

46:49.750 --> 46:52.503
It was very difficult to try to translate

46:52.667 --> 46:57.001
and explain to them some laws and things,
really more cultural things.

46:57.002 --> 47:00.504
You know the laws are different
in every state in the United States.

47:00.667 --> 47:05.423
So the fire marshal would come in
and they would allow this in one city

47:05.583 --> 47:07.585
and not allow that in one city.

47:08.917 --> 47:11.082
I still have language problems!

47:11.083 --> 47:15.293
My English is so bad that those
who understand it turn away from me

47:15.458 --> 47:18.177
and hope that my speech is almost over,

47:18.333 --> 47:22.088
or make a face
like they've just eaten something bad.

47:22.250 --> 47:23.502
It's terrible!

47:23.667 --> 47:28.343
I'm just proud when I get a cup of coffee and
don't end up with a cup of bacon or something!

47:28.500 --> 47:31.504
It hasn't gotten much better,
but I have to admit

47:31.667 --> 47:34.386
that I haven't tried
very hard to improve it.

47:55.625 --> 47:59.675
When you come off the stage, you have
a very peculiar chemistry in your body.

47:59.833 --> 48:03.212
And it has to be compensated,
which I think a party is quite good for.

48:03.375 --> 48:05.298
You have to slowly come down.

48:05.458 --> 48:10.168
The problem is that you always drink a lot and
then spend every evening relatively drunk.

48:33.708 --> 48:35.961
There was always a party afterwards.

48:36.125 --> 48:38.002
I remember hanging out with Till,

48:38.003 --> 48:44.292
we had set up some coffee tables
in the middle of the dressing room

48:44.458 --> 48:49.544
and we had girls dancing naked
on the dressing room coffee table

48:49.708 --> 48:51.631
and one of the tables broke.

49:04.458 --> 49:08.088
We just basically knocked on the door
with like our box of porn.

49:08.250 --> 49:12.175
And then Paul puts the porn on,
fast forward, really fast

49:12.333 --> 49:17.339
and then put our CD on and then started
jumping on the seats and going crazy

49:17.500 --> 49:20.959
and we're doing shots, and I was like,
what just happened?!?!?

49:21.125 --> 49:26.427
I noticed it afterwards in group photos
of us with 'Korn' and the like.

49:26.583 --> 49:32.795
They always looked perfectly normal
and we looked rotten, absolutely destroyed.

49:32.958 --> 49:37.759
Because we got wasted every night and the
Americans just drank beer or something.

49:37.917 --> 49:43.503
We didn't really notice on tour that the
Americans kept an eye on what they were doing,

49:43.708 --> 49:48.088
while every night we treated ourselves
very badly, I have to say.

49:48.089 --> 49:50.962
Well, we had Oktoberfest.

49:51.167 --> 49:55.343
Remember? And then Tom came and
was always giving out vitamin tablets.

49:55.500 --> 49:56.672
A huge bag!

49:56.833 --> 50:02.044
We had to swallow them. And I always
wondered why I couldn't sleep at night!

50:02.045 --> 50:05.501
After three weeks, I
realized: Super boosters!

50:05.667 --> 50:09.251
Something like 10 tablets
and you can't sleep for a whole night!

50:09.417 --> 50:12.466
The bag of tablets came with instructions
that we didn't read!

50:12.625 --> 50:15.253
It said take three in the morning,
two in the afternoon,

50:15.417 --> 50:18.011
and the other four
should not be taken at night!

50:18.012 --> 50:21.584
We always took them all at the same time!

50:21.750 --> 50:23.548
Right before the concert!

50:25.167 --> 50:28.467
And I had to drink a whole bottle of whisky
to even go to bed...

50:28.667 --> 50:33.423
I've never had problems sleeping at night,
but I couldn't sleep for the entire night!

50:33.583 --> 50:34.630
What is going on?!?

50:34.792 --> 50:37.420
We didn't know boosters existed!

50:37.583 --> 50:39.802
And other things to stimulate you.

50:40.292 --> 50:45.128
We met other bands
who gave themselves B12 shots!

50:45.292 --> 50:49.718
I was really impressed!
What are B12 shots?!?

50:50.000 --> 50:51.343
Vitamin B12!

50:58.000 --> 50:59.843
There's another story we have to tell.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.378
This also happened
on the 'Family Values Tour.'

51:02.542 --> 51:10.542
It was Halloween, and the bands all said,
hey, we have to do something special!

51:10.833 --> 51:13.211
Halloween! We have to get dressed up etc.

51:13.458 --> 51:16.632
For example,
all of 'Limp Bizkit' dressed up as Elvises.

51:16.792 --> 51:21.093
For example, yeah!
So then it was our slot.

51:21.250 --> 51:28.384
We went on stage, played one or two songs,
and then suddenly Till was gone!

51:28.542 --> 51:32.501
I thought, Ok, maybe there's a problem
or the mic is broken or something.

51:32.667 --> 51:36.297
Suddenly, Paul was gone!
I thought, strange?!

51:36.458 --> 51:39.758
Then Oli was gone, they were disappearing!

51:39.958 --> 51:43.838
At the end it was just me with drums
and guitar and I thought, what's going on?!

51:44.000 --> 51:49.336
Until I turned around and saw the police
slowly but surely pulling people away!

51:49.500 --> 51:50.626
Really secretively!

51:50.792 --> 51:53.341
After three songs the concert was over!

51:54.417 --> 51:56.920
They seriously dragged us off the stage!
Yeah!

52:02.708 --> 52:05.427
But we weren't completely naked!
We still had nappies on.

52:05.917 --> 52:08.340
Nappies?! I gaffered my balls!

52:08.500 --> 52:12.084
That was black gaffer tape!
Nothing but tape!

52:12.250 --> 52:16.300
And you cheated a bit, I remember!
It looked like an elephant's!

52:16.667 --> 52:19.045
But they couldn't even deal with that!

52:19.208 --> 52:22.712
Just taking your clothes off
or getting undressed, they didn't like it!

52:25.125 --> 52:27.969
Barely a year after touring
with 'Korn' and 'Limp Bizkit, '

52:28.500 --> 52:32.550
'Rammstein' head out
on their own again across the USA.

53:06.083 --> 53:09.792
There are always situations that make
you notice that something has changed.

53:09.958 --> 53:12.507
I remember driving to the concert.

53:12.667 --> 53:16.717
We drove around the corner and suddenly
there were people standing on the sidewalk.

53:16.917 --> 53:20.296
We drove around another corner
and there were still people.

53:20.458 --> 53:23.587
Then finally I realized that it was
a huge queue of people

53:23.750 --> 53:26.253
who wanted to go to our concert.
And I thought, woah!

53:27.750 --> 53:31.425
I was one of the first people
at my school to listen to it.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.005
I brought it to school.

53:33.006 --> 53:37.631
We first listened to it in our music class,

53:37.792 --> 53:41.044
and all the students said:
Horrible! Turn it off!

53:41.045 --> 53:44.717
Then about a week later,
everyone was listening to it.

53:44.875 --> 53:48.300
I don't know! I can't really explain
why I am attracted to it like this.

53:48.458 --> 53:51.587
It's just, it hits on something,
it just stroke a nerve.

53:51.750 --> 53:54.720
It brings over a different culture
you don't have here every day.

53:54.875 --> 53:58.960
The lyrics and the language itself
works as a good instrument.

53:59.125 --> 54:01.088
It's just guttural, it's aggressive.

54:01.089 --> 54:05.042
If it's a song like "Du riechst so gut"
it makes me think of another woman,

54:05.208 --> 54:10.920
But when "Du Hast" comes on, I feel like
I'm walking away from something!

54:11.750 --> 54:14.833
We included, at the time -
again this is all pre-internet -

54:15.000 --> 54:18.209
a card we put in the CD to people
to fill out information.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.129
And we had our address on the back
and people sent it in.

54:22.292 --> 54:26.001
And when people sent back the cards,
one of the questions was:

54:26.167 --> 54:29.091
Would you like a copy of the lyrics
in English?

54:29.250 --> 54:32.220
And we were getting thousands of them!

54:32.375 --> 54:35.041
Oddly enough, I have heard people

54:35.042 --> 54:39.047
taking German based on
being fans of 'Rammstein.'

54:56.167 --> 55:00.343
Each date probably took about
3 to 4 months to book.

55:00.500 --> 55:08.500
The amount of drills we had to go through
for pyro permits, riders, it was tedious.

55:48.625 --> 55:50.673
Tour buses here were a funny thing.

55:50.833 --> 55:53.803
We only knew
the shaky nightliner buses from Germany.

55:53.958 --> 55:58.082
We quickly sorted out everything,
who could lie where.

55:58.083 --> 56:02.543
Richard sleeps there and Till sleeps here.

56:02.708 --> 56:06.963
At the front is the kitchen.

56:07.542 --> 56:13.220
The best thing was that it had a freezer,
it was called Hungry Man, right?

56:13.375 --> 56:20.509
There were 85 pallets of ready meals in it
that you could heat up in the microwave.

56:20.667 --> 56:23.796
We were always excited in the morning
when we met up.

56:23.958 --> 56:28.759
Everyone crept out of their bunks
and then ate that stuff in shifts.

56:28.917 --> 56:32.547
It was such a fine line, because we
thought it was really awesome

56:32.708 --> 56:34.188
but actually it was quite disgusting.

56:34.333 --> 56:36.836
It would expand in the microwave!

56:37.000 --> 56:43.542
Mashed peas or peas with mashed potatoes and
some kind of piece of meat would swell up.

57:08.458 --> 57:11.257
We're in a kind of a bubble, the six of us.

57:11.458 --> 57:16.294
I don't have much to do with the crew
or with any other people.

57:16.458 --> 57:20.008
It's also important
that only the six of us are in the bus,

57:20.167 --> 57:23.546
because we function so well together,
like clockwork.

57:23.708 --> 57:27.463
If there were another cog,
it wouldn't work anymore.

57:35.292 --> 57:38.011
Underwear is fresh,
there's nothing to complain about!

57:38.167 --> 57:40.901
The T-shirt is still OK,
I can wear it again,

57:40.927 --> 57:43.244
but the imprint is a
bit compromising.

57:43.375 --> 57:46.379
I don't think
that American women will like it.

57:46.833 --> 57:49.461
There's no reason to be proud of that.

57:50.250 --> 57:55.302
The problem with touring is that you don't
get the opportunity to entertain yourself.

57:55.458 --> 57:58.337
I take ten books with me every time,
and try to read them.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.674
Every time I come home
with the same ten, unread books.

58:01.833 --> 58:06.259
Maybe I should first explain
how it normally is with a band,

58:06.917 --> 58:12.970
because as a spectator, you don't know
what the problems are on tour.

58:13.125 --> 58:16.550
It's like this, you arrive somewhere,
you don't know exactly where.

58:16.708 --> 58:19.082
Then you go out to eat.

58:19.083 --> 58:21.256
Then you watch TV.

58:21.833 --> 58:25.963
Then it's sound check. Then you hang around
a little bit, and then you play.

58:26.125 --> 58:29.584
If you do it for three
days, it's not so bad,

58:29.750 --> 58:33.550
but if you do it for a month,
it affects your psyche in some way.

58:33.708 --> 58:35.506
I call it the potato syndrome.

58:35.667 --> 58:37.005
You sort of get poured out,

58:37.006 --> 58:40.174
and then have to do what you do every
night, then get collected again.

58:40.333 --> 58:43.132
The only thing you can do,
which I take advantage of,

58:43.292 --> 58:45.670
is watch a lot of films
to learn the language.

58:45.833 --> 58:49.508
A day has 24 hours
and you're on stage for about 1 V2 hours.

58:49.667 --> 58:51.840
The rest of the day is pure boredom.

58:59.208 --> 59:02.587
We have a big toy box with things in it,
like inline skates,

59:02.750 --> 59:05.128
a football, skateboards.

59:07.708 --> 59:11.085
I go with the swim fraction,
which is everyone except Oli and Flake.

59:11.086 --> 59:13.211
The other four go swimming
and I go with them.

59:22.583 --> 59:25.257
Flake always tries desperately
to walk somewhere.

59:27.833 --> 59:32.259
The best part of the day is
when I can wander around.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.628
I can think about things in peace.

59:36.917 --> 59:40.547
When you're so hyped up in the evening,
when so many people applaud you,

59:40.708 --> 59:44.633
the daytime allows you to clarify
why everything is the way it is,

59:44.792 --> 59:47.341
and how to deal with it in the best way.

59:47.500 --> 59:52.041
Because it's hard to feel comfortable
in a foreign country.

59:52.042 --> 59:56.798
I don't really speak the language
so it's nice to have some time

59:56.958 --> 01:00:00.508
to absorb everything in peace
and think about it.

01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:08.999
We have our own cook with us,
because on the first tour of America,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.049
I realised that in order to be
mentally relaxed,

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.585
you need good food.

01:00:14.292 --> 01:00:15.885
What a service!

01:00:17.917 --> 01:00:19.169
So that's our daily routine.

01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:21.961
And that's enough to keep
you from going dumb.

01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:25.841
Of course there are
unforeseen incidents on every tour.

01:00:26.042 --> 01:00:28.670
That's when the fine art
of improvisation is called for.

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.045
Can you explain what happened here?

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:35.626
The stage can't handle the weight!
Only half the PA is set up!

01:00:35.792 --> 01:00:38.090
We can't set up any more,
it's going to break!

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.968
- Meaning?
- That's it!

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:49.964
By virtue of necessity,
we drove back to 'Kern's roadie's house.

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:54.335
He had a pool,
and we invented tequila shotguns.

01:00:54.583 --> 01:00:58.793
We had the kind of water pistols
that kids have, the ones you pump.

01:00:58.958 --> 01:01:03.213
We put tequila in them
and had a really fun tequila pool party,

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:05.969
where we shot each other in the mouths.

01:01:06.125 --> 01:01:08.048
An after-show party without a concert!

01:01:08.417 --> 01:01:09.464
In Salt Lake City,

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:12.754
'Rammstein' have completely different
adverse circumstances to contend with.

01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:30.087
We had to start in daylight, but we have a
show that depends on starting in the dark.

01:01:30.088 --> 01:01:34.338
The show itself, if you play it
in daylight, just doesn't work!

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:40.007
The 'Rammstein' show, the fire
and the contrast, you need it!

01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:44.593
At the end, what happened was
that there was a time limit,

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:47.799
I think around 10pm, and we went over it.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:53.419
We had our encore, the people <i>were
</i> screaming and the show was just cut short.

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:55.130
There is nothing we can do!

01:01:59.292 --> 01:02:01.010
The tour manager came on stage and said,

01:02:01.167 --> 01:02:04.006
there are two vans
full of policemen in front of the door,

01:02:04.007 --> 01:02:06.594
and if you don't stop now
they'll storm the stage!

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:09.045
Don't take it out on the band!
It wasn't them!

01:02:09.046 --> 01:02:12.091
Don't take it out on anyone here,
it wasn't actually the fairgrounds!

01:02:12.092 --> 01:02:17.840
It was Salt Lake City! So, FUCK SALT LAKE!

01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:34.919
There was some kind of drama around
Salt Lake City, because of the Mormons.

01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:37.802
- Salt Lake sucks!
- Exactly!

01:02:38.042 --> 01:02:41.171
And in Worcester,
where nobody thought about it, of course!

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:44.462
When you stop thinking about it,
that's when they strike!

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:48.586
I'm not surprised, I'm not surprised.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:54.177
You know, as liberal as America
likes to think it is,

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:58.417
especially now that we have a black
President and gay marriage and everything,

01:02:58.583 --> 01:03:02.292
we're still very conservative.
We're still very conservative!

01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:09.460
The police came backstage,

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:12.469
we thought they wanted to check
something to do with fire.

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:15.253
Then the tour manager said,
you're now under arrest!

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:19.172
We said, sure, whatever,
and didn't think any more of it.

01:03:19.333 --> 01:03:21.961
I said I would shower
first and they said, no!

01:03:22.125 --> 01:03:24.674
No showering!
You're under arrest! This is for real!

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:26.710
The police stood there with handcuffs.

01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:31.381
I thought, this is a bit stupid.
I quickly showered and put a T-shirt on.

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:34.716
He stood in the bathroom
next to us in his uniform.

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:38.425
They locked Till and me up
in a kind of animal-control van,

01:03:38.583 --> 01:03:43.089
handcuffed us to a. Bar at the back,
and drove us to jail.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.969
Is this the band? Sorry about the U.S.!

01:03:55.667 --> 01:03:56.839
What can you do?!

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.261
It's just like you see on TV!

01:04:00.417 --> 01:04:03.261
There's along hallway with bars,
and between them are the cell walls.

01:04:03.417 --> 01:04:08.999
You sit on a wooden bed,
and there's a stainless steel slab

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.174
that you can use as a toilet bowl
at the bottom and as a tap at the top.

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:14.051
No toilet seat or anything.

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:16.586
So then you can go to the toilet
if you want to,

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:20.129
or sit on the bed. Those are your options.

01:04:20.292 --> 01:04:23.041
At night, the newly-arrested arrived.

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:28.424
They raged and bashed against the cells, and
in shackles were dragged in by four men.

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:31.962
One had a bullet wound in his arm
because he shot at police officers

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:33.798
because they shot his dog.

01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:38.213
They quickly took him to the doctor, bandaged
him up, and then locked him up next to us.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:45.082
Some people were drunk
and snored and moaned and farted,

01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:48.758
so you couldn't sleep. It was impossible.

01:04:48.917 --> 01:04:52.126
And you don't have your glasses
or shoes and no watch,

01:04:52.292 --> 01:04:54.090
so you don't even know how late it is.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.504
It felt like a very long time,
but it was only five hours.

01:04:57.667 --> 01:04:59.135
After that we were released.

01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:16.256
The police intervention is triggered

01:05:16.417 --> 01:05:20.467
by the special staging devised for
the song "Buck Dichâ€œ (Bend Down)",

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:23.674
involving singer Till
and keyboard player Flake.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.631
America has these strange, what are called
"indecency laws" or "decency laws."

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:10.760
And Jim Morrison got arrested for it,

01:06:10.917 --> 01:06:14.046
lots of musicians over time
have been arrested for it.

01:06:14.047 --> 01:06:18.969
These laws are very old, and
they're very selectively applied.

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:24.423
So, it's almost like when the local
police force doesn't like an artist,

01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:26.005
then they apply the laws.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.461
If I have an artistic interpretation
of something

01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:36.838
it's my interpretation of that thing,
which I don't find bad at all.

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:40.709
I mean, if I get out a plastic dildo
and squirt some milk around,

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:45.176
I don't expect to be
locked up because of it.

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:49.839
That this actually happens,
that such a thing exists,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.755
such narrow-mindedness,

01:06:53.917 --> 01:06:56.386
you have to get your
head around that first!

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:05.550
This country is ridiculous,
it's so terrified of everything.

01:07:05.708 --> 01:07:10.384
I love the idea of really
powerful macho men

01:07:10.542 --> 01:07:13.466
playing role-games, role-playing like that,

01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:16.378
to really mainly screw
with other men's heads.

01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:20.752
I mean, none of that freaks me out. But
I'm assuming, it freaks a lot of men out.

01:07:20.917 --> 01:07:24.592
For most heterosexual men,
that's not really appealing.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.754
Whether or not you're offended
by it or not is one thing,

01:07:27.917 --> 01:07:35.381
but it's not really a subject that they
would choose to be exposed to, so to speak.

01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:37.294
It would rather have it over here.

01:07:37.458 --> 01:07:39.961
And what 'Rammstein' does is,
they bring it right here,

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:41.502
right in from of your face.

01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:48.082
Well, I think your average
young meathead,

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:50.586
you see a fake penetration
between two guys,

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:58.750
they're gonna be embarrassed,
repulsed, but ultimately fascinated.

01:07:59.667 --> 01:08:02.341
They probably won't be able you know!

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:09.418
And if it's done theatrically enough,
as part of a successful product.

01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:19.301
That's good, getting arrested.
That's a good thing.

01:08:19.457 --> 01:08:21.335
Your audience loves that even more.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.754
And they worked the dildos, and
they were busted. Fabulous.

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:27.011
They still got to say
what they wanted to say.

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:30.296
They just had to spend a couple hours
in jail and pay a hundred-dollar fine,

01:08:30.457 --> 01:08:32.084
and they could've done it again

01:08:32.085 --> 01:08:35.131
and the same thing probably would
not have happened somewhere else.

01:08:37.917 --> 01:08:40.966
The incident has legal repercussions
for Till and Flake.

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:44.094
Throughout this tour.
In the land of the free

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.796
they have to repeatedly return

01:08:45.957 --> 01:08:48.881
to Worcester to account to
the court for their actions.

01:08:57.582 --> 01:09:01.383
Some of the local citizens
are not used to so much open-mindedness.

01:09:02.917 --> 01:09:05.716
I like the band! I think the band is good.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:09.755
But what they did should have been left
behind closed doors!

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:16.175
America is a much more puritanical country
and we, our sex is sort of kept hidden.

01:09:16.332 --> 01:09:19.542
Which is strange because we are
the porn capital of the world,

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:21.176
but we're a puritanical country.

01:09:21.332 --> 01:09:25.133
I believe we did have to send documents
just saying that it was all simulated,

01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:29.001
that there was no actual nudity and
there was no actual sex on stage.

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:31.340
Yeah, just dumb, dumb stuff.

01:09:38.792 --> 01:09:40.135
Our Doggy here

01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:48.048
is scared to go back to jail,
back to the big, bad people.

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.627
We had to get used
to a lot of things in America.

01:09:51.792 --> 01:09:54.341
Because we know it as the Land of Freedom,

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.379
the land of dishwashers
who become millionaires.

01:09:57.542 --> 01:10:00.466
I always thought
you could do what you wanted here.

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:03.094
It's crazy when a bit of
fun turns so serious.

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:06.333
As a band, you feel pretty untouchable.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.049
You're the king, everyone
thinks you're great,

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:14.970
people ï¬‚atter you. You're driven around,
and your every wish is catered for.

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:20.210
Then suddenly
you're not the king anymore,

01:10:20.375 --> 01:10:22.798
you're hardly anything.

01:10:22.958 --> 01:10:27.043
Yeah, but since then you have a record,
and every time they enter the country

01:10:27.208 --> 01:10:28.835
they both have to be interviewed.

01:10:29.167 --> 01:10:31.465
We just wait. We have two shuttles,

01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:35.084
so the band is comfortably in the hotel
while Till and Flake

01:10:35.085 --> 01:10:38.713
get to sit there for another hour
and be harassed.

01:10:38.875 --> 01:10:42.334
I can't get used to the fact that you
can't just pee against a tree somewhere.

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.253
I was put in a paddy wagon in Texas

01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:50.041
because I pissed between two bins
at the exit behind the stage.

01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:53.999
And then it went off!
You're in my country, in my city,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.209
this is my district
and you won't be peeing anywhere!

01:10:57.375 --> 01:11:00.754
Just don't talk back, otherwise
you'll end up in jail immediately!

01:11:00.958 --> 01:11:04.542
And that, to me, is a bit more restrictive
to personal freedom

01:11:04.708 --> 01:11:06.631
than what we're used to in Europe.

01:11:06.792 --> 01:11:08.669
Since then, we're very humble,

01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:11.052
even the fire marshal gets fawned over,

01:11:11.208 --> 01:11:13.802
because you can't allow
yourself any mistakes.

01:11:13.958 --> 01:11:17.667
The so-called authorities here,
they have such power!

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:20.507
They can send you home overnight.

01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:24.258
They revoke your work permit
or cancel the concert,

01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:28.126
you go to jail or just
pay a ridiculous fine.

01:11:28.292 --> 01:11:34.459
If something challenging and shocking
is not a product, you'll be punished.

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:36.593
But if it becomes a product,

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.253
â€œOh yeah, they're doing that
in Madison Square Garden,

01:11:39.417 --> 01:11:42.546
I wanna go see that giant
penis right now!â€œ.

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:23.505
In 1999 'Rammstein'
tour Latin America with 'Kiss.'

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.082
Myth,

01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:27.050
Power,

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:28.130
Excess,

01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:29.334
Eroticism,

01:13:29.708 --> 01:13:33.793
The most perfect German machine in Mexico.

01:13:36.417 --> 01:13:38.840
The rest is history.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.549
Tickets on sale now!

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:47.261
They still built Beetles here,
you can tell straight away!

01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:51.335
There, another Beetle!

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.047
One, two, three Beetles.

01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:56.257
I'll tell you when I see
a Beetle, Schneider.

01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:02.715
There's a press conference this evening.

01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:07.127
Who is taking part in the press conference?

01:14:07.292 --> 01:14:09.636
All of us!

01:14:11.583 --> 01:14:13.460
Right after that...

01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:17.584
After the press conference?
There are going to be free records again.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.999
- Where 30 selected...
- CDs

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.753
listeners can get their CDs signed.

01:14:29.417 --> 01:14:32.011
Quickly, run along the wall!
As fast as you can!

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:35.837
We drove there in a shuttle
and thought there's a protest going on,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.709
we have to get around it somehow.
Then the driver said it was because of us!

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.627
And then there was complete panic.

01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:45.751
We had to get into this record store
within three, four minutes.

01:14:45.917 --> 01:14:49.467
They closed the shutters behind us and the
people crushed themselves against it!

01:14:49.625 --> 01:14:52.834
All the roads were blocked!
People were standing on buildings.

01:15:01.833 --> 01:15:04.131
Then the chief of police
came to us and said:

01:15:04.292 --> 01:15:08.217
If you don't go onto the roof
and say something to calm people down,

01:15:08.375 --> 01:15:11.424
because they're taking the ï¬‚ower
boxes apart on the boulevard,

01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:12.835
then you'll be arrested!

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.048
And I said, how is this our fault?

01:15:15.208 --> 01:15:18.337
Well, this is all because of you!
He was really angry!

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:24.428
So we went onto the roof and yelled
through the megaphone in jumbled Spanish.

01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:26.551
There were people everywhere!

01:15:26.708 --> 01:15:29.336
The parking garage opposite
was stuffed with people.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.469
And when Till took the
megaphone in his hand

01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:43.048
and shouted something to the masses,

01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:46.838
and they screamed,
there was this feeling of, OK!

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:54.794
You can say anything here, they'll scream
and think we're great regardless.

01:15:54.958 --> 01:15:58.041
That was the first time we realized
the kind of responsibility

01:15:58.208 --> 01:16:00.552
we carry in what we do.

01:16:00.708 --> 01:16:02.802
Then we went down again and left.

01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:11.261
Do I have everything? Did they rob me?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.083
Something like that
never happened to us before!

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:21.094
And it was so out of the blue!
We thought we were just going

01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.844
to an autograph session,
and suddenly there was a riot.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.209
People don't believe us
when we tell them that people in Mexico

01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:31.084
sing along twice as loudly as in Germany,
where we actually come from.

01:16:31.085 --> 01:16:35.884
I remember that, in Mexico, entire families
came to the concert, with kids and everything.

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:01.427
What left a lasting impression on me was

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:07.750
that the Mexican audience was
fully outfitted in T-shirts we didn't make!

01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:12.627
They had unbelievably cool designs
and were graphically very interesting.

01:17:12.792 --> 01:17:17.844
Only later did we realize that they
just have their own market for it there.

01:17:34.208 --> 01:17:39.214
There was a street
with a merchandise shop on each side.

01:17:39.375 --> 01:17:40.752
I've never seen anything like it!

01:17:40.917 --> 01:17:43.340
They had 'Rammstein'
merchandise, and they sell it there.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.468
Everything that you could possibly imagine,

01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:49.004
everything you need for your household,
had 'Rammstein' on it.

01:17:49.005 --> 01:17:52.504
That's what they sold.
It was cheap, but they had everything!

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.756
The tour takes 'Rammstein' to the city of
Teotihuacan in the Mexican high plains,

01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:05.041
one of America's most significant ruins.

01:18:05.042 --> 01:18:10.094
Named by the Aztecs, the place
translates as "where man becomes god."

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:14.427
It's really exhausting!

01:18:20.792 --> 01:18:26.674
I fell something like three meters
on the last pyramid and sprained my leg.

01:18:31.792 --> 01:18:35.092
How did that happen? You wanted to jump up
somewhere? Or jump down?

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:38.174
I wanted to climb down
normally, I just fell.

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:44.215
Then during the show, because we still
had to play, I was getting shots

01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:46.377
so that it wouldn't hurt so much!

01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:11.211
The thing about South America is,

01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:14.002
it's great audiences,
but very difficult to tour.

01:19:14.003 --> 01:19:17.300
Because you have to ship,
ï¬‚y everything from city to city,

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:20.047
you can't just put it
in trucks and let it go

01:19:20.048 --> 01:19:23.376
because you don't know if it's going
to show up at the other end.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.505
So, for the most part.
Also the distances are so great, too.

01:19:29.667 --> 01:19:31.385
So you have to airfreight stuff.

01:19:35.375 --> 01:19:39.505
The South American tour
also takes in Argentina and Brazil.

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:48.753
The shared concerts
with 'Kiss' in South America

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:51.295
are a particular highlight for 'Rammstein.'

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.962
I remember the first concert in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, as they came out.

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:11.459
And suddenly I ran after them
like a little kid

01:20:11.625 --> 01:20:15.255
and reverted back to my 14-year-old self.

01:20:15.417 --> 01:20:18.341
Because there were,
like I said, these little pictures

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:22.300
that you could buy for something like
20 deutschmarks on the school corner,

01:20:23.167 --> 01:20:25.215
and I would stare
at these pictures constantly,

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:28.629
with intense fantasies
running through my head.

01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:33.468
I thought their appearance, their makeup
and style was totally awesome!

01:20:34.667 --> 01:20:40.345
If we are in any way responsible
for giving them the inspiration,

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:42.089
it's something to be proud of!

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:46.380
They are out there,
maybe if they weren't a band,

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:50.172
they would be burning houses down,
so we keep them on stage.

01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:55.757
I think 'Rammstein' seems
like a German band.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:21:00.297
They've got something about them,
there's a vibe, the great pyro.

01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:02.836
These guys, I heard that a couple
of the guys in the band

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.628
are actually professional pyrotechnicians.

01:21:05.792 --> 01:21:09.251
So, they do that very uniquely and
it's over the top!

01:21:09.417 --> 01:21:12.842
And anything like that, any band like that
definitely appeals to us as well,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.881
even though they probably got some of
their stuff originally from this band!

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:26.043
At some point, I remember, I was on stage
with Oli, there was a moment -

01:21:26.044 --> 01:21:29.717
you never saw them, those guys,
because they always had makeup on -

01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:32.045
we were standing there looking at them,

01:21:32.046 --> 01:21:35.797
and then Paul Stanley turned around
during the concert and went like this.

01:21:37.667 --> 01:21:41.922
Or I was with Schneider,
and I was like: WOW!

01:21:47.667 --> 01:21:52.844
However, the band find out first hand just
how unforgiving the 'Kiss Army' can be.

01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:13.050
We've never experienced so much hate
from the audience as we did in Sao Paulo.

01:22:13.208 --> 01:22:16.257
When we came on stage,
they thought 'Kiss' was starting.

01:22:16.417 --> 01:22:18.340
And then some German idiots appeared

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.969
and started to play things
no one could understand.

01:22:21.125 --> 01:22:24.004
Of course they lost it
and started throwing things at us,

01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:27.209
lighters, small bottles, rocks.

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:31.676
It was a nightmare!
I think it was the worst concert ever!

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.844
At the end, the event organizer
even said to us, I remember

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.380
you should be glad
they didn't throw half a goat at you.

01:22:56.542 --> 01:22:59.011
That's normal. You did well.

01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:12.086
After the South American tour
it will be two years

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:16.881
before 'Rammstein' tour North America
again, with the new album "Mutter.â€œ".

01:23:27.208 --> 01:23:30.087
The one mistake I think a lot of
European artists make

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:34.084
when they come to the States,
is they forget how big it is.

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:37.796
And like a lot of European artists
will come to the States to tour

01:23:37.958 --> 01:23:41.758
and play ten shows and think that's a tour.

01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:44.586
Whereas, you look at some
of these American artists

01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:47.219
like 'Kid Rock'
or 'Dave Matthews' or whomever,

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.583
they play 200 shows in America every year.

01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:13.844
'Rammstein' play more than 40 concerts,

01:24:14.042 --> 01:24:18.627
27 of them in 4 weeks on their headlining
summer tour, and a further 20 in autumn -

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:22.379
a punishingly tight schedule
for everyone involved.

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:31.011
It was so tedious, because you spend time
in so many areas that aren't very exciting.

01:24:31.208 --> 01:24:35.258
Of course, New York is interesting,
and San Francisco is nice and so is LA.

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:44.752
I loved New Orleans.

01:24:44.917 --> 01:24:49.673
It had an extremely dark appeal
when I was there,

01:24:49.833 --> 01:24:52.507
but a very interesting appeal.

01:24:53.542 --> 01:24:58.093
The West Coast, San Francisco
and Seattle were really cool.

01:24:58.417 --> 01:25:02.297
L.A., of course, but everything around
that was quite difficult.

01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:29.383
In July alone they perform
in a different city almost every day,

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.506
traversing the entire country.

01:25:31.792 --> 01:25:36.673
The enormous distances covered can't fail
to leave an impression on the musicians.

01:25:42.583 --> 01:25:45.962
Most hard rock bands are on the road
for like 2 years straight,

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:49.675
they have no life and no body,
'cause they just tour nonstop.

01:25:49.833 --> 01:25:53.667
When you are an American band
touring the U.S. for two years,

01:25:53.833 --> 01:25:56.952
you're like a heartless
soul, it's disgusting.

01:25:56.978 --> 01:25:59.035
It's a terrible place to tour.

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:23.709
The toughest time really is
being away from your friends and family.

01:26:23.875 --> 01:26:27.459
And a lot of the times
when you're on the road for a long time,

01:26:27.625 --> 01:26:29.753
you kind of stay the same.

01:26:29.917 --> 01:26:34.002
Like the band, we're still the same people
even if we're gone for 5 or 6 months.

01:26:34.167 --> 01:26:36.420
But you get home and things have changed.

01:26:36.833 --> 01:26:43.041
Really weird things happen, like they
forget you at home. You're a stranger!

01:26:43.042 --> 01:26:45.033
I think that's the
most difficult point,

01:26:45.059 --> 01:26:47.243
it's re-adjusting to
life once you get home.

01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:52.548
'Rammstein' miss the old days...

01:26:55.792 --> 01:26:57.590
Now everyone has their own hotel room,

01:26:57.750 --> 01:27:00.089
we don't see each other,
it's actually boring.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:02.677
In general, it's better like that
for such a long tour,

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:07.760
but sometimes you long for how it was back
when we all drove around in a little bus

01:27:07.917 --> 01:27:11.717
and had a plate with sandwiches,
which was the food for the entire day.

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:15.084
As far as the atmosphere goes,
it was somehow better than now.

01:27:15.085 --> 01:27:17.757
We were more like a band,
we kind of lived together.

01:27:17.917 --> 01:27:21.091
Back then, Till used to go
to the petrol station and steal food.

01:27:21.092 --> 01:27:24.212
We'd rip open the bags
in the bus and eat it.

01:27:24.417 --> 01:27:27.546
It was fun, and there was
a good feeling among us.

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:31.630
Now you just order room service,
it's not a lifestyle!

01:27:33.667 --> 01:27:37.044
What preceded the 2001
'Pledge of Allegiance' tour,

01:27:37.045 --> 01:27:39.136
with Slipknot' and 'System of a Down, '

01:27:39.292 --> 01:27:42.967
remains stamped in memory
far beyond 'Rammstein.'

01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:04.587
This was the apartment
of my then-girlfriend,

01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:08.755
and it's also where I
witnessed September 11.

01:28:08.917 --> 01:28:16.051
At around 9 am, a friend phoned me
from Europe.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:20.668
I was lying in bed,
and she wondered if I was OK.

01:28:20.833 --> 01:28:22.631
I didn't understand what she meant

01:28:22.792 --> 01:28:25.796
because I thought
she was asking if I had arrived safely.

01:28:25.958 --> 01:28:28.086
Then she said, no! You have to get out!

01:28:28.087 --> 01:28:33.044
So I Raft here and went around the corner.

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:39.011
That's where I saw
the second plane ï¬‚y into the second tower.

01:28:41.417 --> 01:28:43.670
The crew was in the air as it happened,

01:28:43.833 --> 01:28:50.041
and then they were rerouted to Montreal and
had to wait in a huge arena for two days,

01:28:50.042 --> 01:28:52.090
and were given crispy bread to eat.

01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:06.674
I remember the band being frustrated
after some of the shows

01:29:06.833 --> 01:29:09.712
because of the reaction,
was not what they expected.

01:29:18.208 --> 01:29:23.169
The extreme strain of recent years
takes its toll on the band on this tour.

01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:27.009
There are tensions between
Paul and Richard,

01:29:27.035 --> 01:29:29.817
and the atmosphere
hits rock bottom.

01:29:36.208 --> 01:29:39.587
The post-9/11 political
climate does not help.

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:45.712
Everyone from the bus driver
to the cleaning lady was mobilized!

01:29:45.875 --> 01:29:49.960
Everyone wanted to bomb something,
wanted to find those responsible!

01:29:50.125 --> 01:29:53.425
We had this feeling, that sentiment
that existed all over Europe,

01:29:53.583 --> 01:29:57.258
that America was suddenly so strange
and not like it used to be.

01:29:57.417 --> 01:30:00.967
We weren't even talking to each other
from time to time,

01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:05.551
whatever. We often didn't talk
to each other anymore.

01:30:14.625 --> 01:30:20.177
Some of the band members
were very uneasy with 9/11.

01:30:20.333 --> 01:30:24.213
And one <i>m</i> particular
decided to call it quits

01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:28.960
and get on a plane and ï¬‚y out of JFK
and said bye bye.

01:30:29.125 --> 01:30:32.095
In the end, Flake just went home.

01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:35.880
Right! Now I remember.

01:30:36.458 --> 01:30:43.376
It was so bad for him
that he just left everything behind,

01:30:43.542 --> 01:30:47.422
went to the airport and ï¬‚ew home.
He just threw in the towel.

01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:52.210
So you do notice that it's a certain...

01:30:52.417 --> 01:30:56.672
But I have to add that we
totally slipped into this wave of hysteria,

01:30:56.833 --> 01:31:02.966
and I found the frenzied atmosphere
very frightening.

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:07.511
The whole of the USA is gripped by 9/11,

01:31:07.917 --> 01:31:11.717
with society paralyzed
by the fear of further terrorist attacks.

01:31:12.292 --> 01:31:15.091
The land of freedom
and limitless possibilities

01:31:15.333 --> 01:31:19.008
begins to turn in on itself
and loses some of its lustre.

01:31:19.792 --> 01:31:21.669
And it was sort of a dividing line.

01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:28.876
To me, that tour was were 'Rammstein' stopped
trying to force things to work in America

01:31:29.042 --> 01:31:33.843
and stopped playing by the rules
and just went away for a while and waited,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.631
whether by accident or design,
waited for America to come to them.

01:31:47.792 --> 01:31:52.252
As a result 'Rammstein' concentrate more
on their career outside of America.

01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:59.713
By dint of their experiences
after 9/11 'Rammstein' start incorporating

01:31:59.917 --> 01:32:03.296
contemporary critiques
into their songs for the first time.

01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:39.631
For us, or in my eyes, the song
was a direct answer to the Iraq war,

01:32:40.625 --> 01:32:45.631
the US invasion.
We neatly wrapped it in words

01:32:45.792 --> 01:32:49.217
so that you should be able to understand,
but you don't have to.

01:32:49.708 --> 01:32:57.708
The song describes how all countries are
infected by America and culturally inï¬‚uenced,

01:32:58.375 --> 01:33:04.633
that we get all kinds of American brands
everywhere and are very Americanized.

01:33:04.792 --> 01:33:08.001
The lyrics describe this with a wink.

01:33:16.708 --> 01:33:20.004
Americans are saying that they're
the greatest country in the world,

01:33:20.005 --> 01:33:22.048
that they're the strongest country
in the world.

01:33:22.208 --> 01:33:27.669
But more importantly, it shows a kind of lack
of understanding of how diverse this world is

01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:33.840
and how amazingly culturally different
we are from one society to another.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.961
And I think that that song came out
at a particular time

01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:42.584
when America was feeling very powerful

01:33:42.833 --> 01:33:46.167
and America's will was being felt
all around the world

01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:50.082
whether it be militarily, socially,
economically

01:33:50.083 --> 01:33:52.506
and they were having a go with that.

01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:05.502
So the U.S. are the masters at

01:34:05.667 --> 01:34:09.297
making one-dimensional, Coca-Cola,
nightmare superstars.

01:34:09.458 --> 01:34:13.082
It's next to impossible to make it
in this country

01:34:13.083 --> 01:34:16.007
unless you do, what I said earlier,
this road-warrior mania,

01:34:16.167 --> 01:34:17.760
where you go to every small town.

01:34:17.917 --> 01:34:21.626
So there is no appreciation
by the industry.

01:34:21.792 --> 01:34:24.511
There are people here who love heavy music,

01:34:24.667 --> 01:34:28.501
who love alternative culture,
who want crazy shit,

01:34:28.667 --> 01:34:31.999
but the mainstream is like blanketing

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.504
everybody's front page
of their whatever website

01:34:35.667 --> 01:34:39.626
and every stupid magazine
with the most bubble-gum crap.

01:34:39.917 --> 01:34:42.966
The American market is hard to conquer
because it's always changing.

01:34:43.125 --> 01:34:47.585
If you are trying to be top 40,
you're like really, really widely popular,

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:50.173
you'd have to keep changing
your sound and your look.

01:34:50.333 --> 01:34:52.210
And who wants to do that?
That's pathetic.

01:34:54.958 --> 01:34:58.588
In 2005 'Rammstein'
parody the jaded star system

01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:02.425
in the spectacularly
funny video to their song "Keine Lust."

01:35:03.083 --> 01:35:07.884
Humor and self-mockery become an increasingly
useful stylistic weapon in their arsenal.

01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:49.840
I remember I saw that one on MTV once and
I took out my camera and I filmed the TV,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.719
'cause I never saw it in America,
and I was laughing,

01:35:52.875 --> 01:35:56.960
I was watching and laughing and the camera
was moving while I'm watching the video

01:35:57.125 --> 01:36:01.210
and I'm filming and sent it to my wife
you know, like, check this out.

01:36:01.958 --> 01:36:03.676
This is so bad ass.

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:25.296
They're not afraid to take risks,
look crazy, look funny,

01:36:25.458 --> 01:36:27.506
look gay even. Which is great, you know.

01:36:27.667 --> 01:36:30.637
That's the funniest thing in the world, you
can do anything and not fear anyone,

01:36:30.792 --> 01:36:32.510
that's the best thing in the world.

01:36:50.875 --> 01:36:52.969
Promoting music is very, very difficult.

01:36:53.125 --> 01:36:56.834
Because in the old days, there were
basically three things, four things.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.836
There were record stores,
magazines, MTV and radio.

01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:07.999
Now, MTV is reality TV, record stores
unfortunately don't really exist,

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.999
radio is 'Justin Bieber'

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.801
and magazines just get
smaller and smaller and smaller. So...

01:37:14.958 --> 01:37:19.964
that's why most musicians now sort
of try and promote to their fans.

01:37:20.125 --> 01:37:23.129
And then hope that the fans
talk about it to their friends.

01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:32.005
It is only fitting that film director
Robert Cohen is a massive 'Rammstein' fan.

01:37:32.875 --> 01:37:36.880
He wants to secure the band for his
action film 'Triple X' at all costs.

01:37:37.792 --> 01:37:39.260
Starring action hero Vin Diesel,

01:37:39.417 --> 01:37:43.172
it is guaranteed wide public awareness
amongst fans of the genre.

01:37:50.958 --> 01:37:55.043
But their international popularity is being
boosted by more than just the silver screen.

01:37:59.667 --> 01:38:02.967
In that time frame, something came along
called "the Internet."

01:38:03.125 --> 01:38:09.588
And all the fans of the bands' music,
whoever became interested in 'Rammstein, '

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:13.084
all they had to go on
was watching clips on YouTube.

01:38:13.085 --> 01:38:15.177
And the longer the band stayed away,

01:38:15.333 --> 01:38:18.257
it almost seemed like the more
anticipation got built up.

01:38:18.708 --> 01:38:20.585
Definitely, I look up
YouTubes of 'Rammstein, '

01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:23.594
because they just do everything
and there's so many of them

01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:26.128
that you can just watch one after the other

01:38:26.292 --> 01:38:29.341
and just see something totally interesting
and inspiring.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.176
A new era has dawned. The Internet
is a virtually taboo-free zone.

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:44.377
'Rammstein' are adventurous enough

01:38:44.542 --> 01:38:46.715
to exploit the medium's possibilities.

01:38:54.875 --> 01:38:57.845
"The band conceive
something special for the song â€œPussy,"

01:38:58.167 --> 01:39:02.252
supported in this endeavor
by Swedish video director jonas Akerlund.

01:39:04.458 --> 01:39:08.133
I wasn't sure if he would like
this kind of humour.

01:39:08.667 --> 01:39:13.548
But I said, if anyone can make
a video for this song, then it's him,

01:39:13.708 --> 01:39:20.296
because he has a kind of darkness and
seriousness that is somehow never inane.

01:39:20.458 --> 01:39:27.797
We sent him the song,
and he emailed me saying,

01:39:27.958 --> 01:39:30.427
let's start a revolution!

01:39:33.417 --> 01:39:35.218
This video is gonna piss
a lot of people off!

01:39:35.667 --> 01:39:41.174
And this video is gonna be
thought-provoking and irritating and funny

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:46.711
and sexy and musical and stylish and
beautiful and everything at once!

01:39:48.667 --> 01:39:54.959
We love the way that jonas deals
with controversial topics, and his courage.

01:39:59.208 --> 01:40:00.334
The plan works!

01:40:00.708 --> 01:40:04.463
The uncensored video is only available
on Internet porn channels.

01:40:05.042 --> 01:40:09.172
'Rammstein' cause an outcry amongst the
guardians of public virtue and morality.

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:12.424
It is welcome publicity, and great fun!

01:40:27.042 --> 01:40:30.626
Media is so fractured. I'm sure
it's the same case in Germany, where...

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.756
it used to be there were like four music
magazines and now there are 15,000 blogs.

01:40:35.917 --> 01:40:39.672
It's very hard for one act
to make a huge impact.

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:42.882
I mean, even the big bands like 'U2'
don't get that much attention.

01:41:03.292 --> 01:41:06.216
After a seven-year break
the band return to America,

01:41:06.917 --> 01:41:08.169
taking up residence in a studio

01:41:08.417 --> 01:41:13.173
near San Francisco to record their album
"Liebe ist fur alle da."

01:41:22.667 --> 01:41:27.093
What I like about America is that it's
a country with an energy that says do it!

01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:30.800
Germans tend to think first, then do.

01:41:30.958 --> 01:41:34.917
We hoped that through America, we would
also be able to do first, and then think.

01:41:35.083 --> 01:41:37.962
Let me open up another track
and we do one more of those, OK?

01:41:38.167 --> 01:41:39.760
- OK!
- Here we go!

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:12.000
It's always fun for me when a song is suddenly
created out of individual ideas or emotions.

01:42:12.250 --> 01:42:16.676
The process of the song growing and
maturing is very beautiful to me.

01:42:33.458 --> 01:42:36.792
I came up with a little trick.

01:42:37.667 --> 01:42:40.170
Every song has a certain tempo.

01:42:40.667 --> 01:42:47.380
This song is, for example, 120 bpm.
My heart is usually around 90.

01:42:47.542 --> 01:42:52.969
I try to match
my heartbeat or pulse to the song,

01:42:53.125 --> 01:42:56.755
so I'm in the right groove
to play to the beat.

01:42:56.917 --> 01:42:58.214
I'm at 90 right now,

01:42:58.375 --> 01:43:03.757
I do a few pushups
to get my heart back to 120.

01:43:03.917 --> 01:43:05.590
Alright! Rock 'n' Roll!

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.550
The environment in which you work together
is very important,

01:43:38.708 --> 01:43:43.259
and how free
each band member is from stress.

01:44:04.042 --> 01:44:08.548
When we looked at the studio on the
Internet, it said there was a tree house.

01:44:08.708 --> 01:44:12.292
For me, that was the reason to come here,

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:19.133
because living in a tree and waking up and
falling asleep in nature is something special.

01:44:19.292 --> 01:44:22.751
If you get the chance, you should take it,
that was my thought.

01:44:23.625 --> 01:44:29.428
And I like to live secluded
and not be right in the community.

01:44:40.125 --> 01:44:42.093
After being away for many years,

01:44:42.250 --> 01:44:45.834
they kept pushing the issue
to come to America with a full show.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.719
Playing the arena,
playing with the full production.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.469
The first show was up in Quebec,

01:45:06.625 --> 01:45:10.004
it was a town festival
and the city had spent a lot of money,

01:45:10.005 --> 01:45:15.006
the entire province goes there,
something like 120,000, 130,000 people.

01:45:15.167 --> 01:45:17.761
It's a basin, it was totally packed.

01:45:17.917 --> 01:45:22.627
And seemingly because of us,
and 'Pink's playing the day before,

01:45:22.792 --> 01:45:25.716
40,000 or 50,000 Americans came.

01:45:25.875 --> 01:45:29.709
It was an amazing festival.

01:45:58.208 --> 01:46:01.667
It means a lot to me
that there are so many people here

01:46:01.833 --> 01:46:04.085
that get really excited when we play.

01:46:04.086 --> 01:46:06.836
If I can make them happy,
that makes me happy too.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.006
And these people happen to be American, so
you have to play here to make them happy.

01:46:12.167 --> 01:46:14.215
You can't just ï¬‚y them all to Europe.

01:46:20.792 --> 01:46:24.251
I think, it's interesting that they stayed
away from the U.S. for so long,

01:46:24.417 --> 01:46:27.466
and played everywhere else in the world.
And I think in a way,

01:46:27.625 --> 01:46:32.461
that that sort of made people
hungrier here for them, to see them.

01:46:39.667 --> 01:46:42.044
There wasn't a single promoter in New York

01:46:42.045 --> 01:46:44.636
that would take the risk for 'Rammstein'
to play MSG.

01:46:44.792 --> 01:46:48.376
Between all the guys with all the
big pockets, nobody would touch it.

01:46:48.542 --> 01:46:52.968
And we made a painstaking effort
to go to MSG directly.

01:46:58.458 --> 01:47:01.837
Madison Square Garden is one
of the most famous venues in the world.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.300
I mean, everyone's heard of
Madison Square Garden.

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:11.212
And it's sort of a sign, when a band
can play there, of being real rock stars.

01:47:11.375 --> 01:47:13.844
You know, so every band
when you're growing up,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.924
you just have this idea of playing
Madison Square Garden.

01:47:23.375 --> 01:47:30.259
It was probably a three-year-plus process,
in discussions and development

01:47:30.417 --> 01:47:34.047
and a lot of back and forth
of how crazy this is,

01:47:34.208 --> 01:47:37.004
and how risky this is,
but I give the band a lot of credit,

01:47:37.005 --> 01:47:39.094
because they really they took the risk.

01:47:39.250 --> 01:47:43.084
This was the first attempt
to headline the band in America

01:47:43.085 --> 01:47:48.715
with full European production
of 18 to 20 trucks, full pyrotechnics,

01:47:48.875 --> 01:47:52.425
as many effects
as the authorities would allow.

01:47:52.583 --> 01:47:55.837
This was the show to stake
the claim in America,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.050
everything prior was a build,
was growth, was development.

01:48:00.208 --> 01:48:05.385
This was the pinnacle, this was the defining
moment that put 'Rammstein' back here.

01:48:16.625 --> 01:48:19.549
When the band finally announced
they were coming back,

01:48:19.708 --> 01:48:22.837
all these people who had been hearing
about it and buying the albums

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.084
and looking at YouTube dips,
and waiting, finally had their chance.

01:48:27.085 --> 01:48:31.338
The fact that they waited might be better
for them in the long run in America

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:36.176
than had they continued to come every couple
of years or every album-cycle. Or whatever.

01:48:36.458 --> 01:48:37.880
They're coming!

01:48:41.667 --> 01:48:43.965
The most explosive band on earth!

01:48:44.125 --> 01:48:48.710
This is your only chance to see
'Rammstein' in the United States!

01:48:48.875 --> 01:48:51.048
Tickets on sale now!

01:48:51.833 --> 01:48:54.086
I was at home in Berlin when it started.

01:48:54.250 --> 01:49:00.257
10 minutes: 5,000 tickets,
12 minutes 15,000 tickets,

01:49:00.417 --> 01:49:03.091
In the space of 20 minutes it was sold out,

01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:06.049
and I jumped around
in my apartment like a teddy bear!

01:49:06.208 --> 01:49:07.630
I was so happy!

01:49:18.208 --> 01:49:20.336
This band can sell out
Madison Square Garden,

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:23.128
it's like 18,000 people, it's a big deal.

01:49:23.292 --> 01:49:24.760
It's amazing that they did that.

01:49:24.917 --> 01:49:27.921
What I found phenomenal about that
is they managed to do all of that

01:49:28.083 --> 01:49:29.801
after not playing here for over ten years.

01:49:29.958 --> 01:49:35.010
That's quite an accomplishment
in today's music industry and music scene.

01:49:35.708 --> 01:49:38.552
So, it was very rewarding.

01:49:38.708 --> 01:49:41.427
One of the most rewarding
highlights in my career

01:49:41.583 --> 01:49:44.917
as far as being involved in the
music business, if not the most.

01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:50.211
The show is huge, I mean it is
a very deep stage, a very wide stage,

01:49:50.375 --> 01:49:52.924
so it fills the room quite a bit,

01:49:53.083 --> 01:49:59.716
and I just remember the first time that they
let off all the lyco jets at the same time.

01:49:59.875 --> 01:50:02.045
The ones up in the air
and the ones on the ï¬‚oor.

01:50:02.046 --> 01:50:05.091
It sucked all the oxygen
out of the room instantly,

01:50:05.250 --> 01:50:07.844
and it felt
like my whole head was compressing.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.709
It was so bizarre.
It was the most unbelievable feeling.

01:50:22.042 --> 01:50:23.544
Can I take a picture with you?

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.172
- Come here!
- Awesome!

01:50:25.333 --> 01:50:28.177
Is it ready?
Yeah, it's ready! Oh, my God!

01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.717
Hu ' Hi!

01:50:31.292 --> 01:50:32.965
YEAH! OH, YEAH!

01:50:34.958 --> 01:50:37.586
Most famous arena in the world!
Right there, baby!

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.379
Here's a great story actually: The morning
of the Madison Square Garden show,

01:50:41.542 --> 01:50:45.627
we're staying at a hotel in New jersey,
and I met up with a friend for breakfast,

01:50:45.792 --> 01:50:49.046
and I'm standing on line
waiting to pay for my breakfast,

01:50:49.208 --> 01:50:51.256
and there's a girl in line in front of me,

01:50:51.417 --> 01:50:55.047
so the gentleman behind the counter
says to her: "How are you today?"

01:50:55.048 --> 01:50:56.464
And she says:

01:50:56.625 --> 01:51:01.631
"I'm great! I'm going to see 'Rammstein'
tonight at Madison Square Garden!â€œ."

01:51:01.792 --> 01:51:06.502
And I say, did I just hear you say that
you're going to see 'Rammstein' tonight?

01:51:06.667 --> 01:51:09.011
She's like: "You better believe it, man!"

01:51:09.167 --> 01:51:11.841
I've been waiting
fuckin' 10 years for this shit."

01:51:21.542 --> 01:51:25.422
That was the representation of what
everyone in that audience was feeling!

01:51:25.583 --> 01:51:27.802
It's finally here and I can': Wait!

01:51:29.625 --> 01:51:33.050
My son is fifteen years old,
that's his favorite band,

01:51:33.051 --> 01:51:39.004
so I was like dad of the month, because
I got him tickets to go see the show.

01:51:47.875 --> 01:51:52.210
We begged to have a few chairs removed
so that at least a few people could stand.

01:51:52.375 --> 01:51:55.219
So that it looks like a rock concert.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:58.584
It's more of a seated Sting' concert venue.

01:52:04.292 --> 01:52:08.045
We have a band ritual where we always drink
a tequila right before we go on stage.

01:52:08.046 --> 01:52:11.842
We look each other in the eyes and clink
glasses so that we get a bit of a connection.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.798
We don't communicate on stage,

01:52:13.958 --> 01:52:16.427
that's why this human interaction
is a very important moment.

01:52:18.167 --> 01:52:20.716
I don't know if I've ever seen a band

01:52:20.875 --> 01:52:23.173
that did not sing in English
play at the Garden.

01:52:24.917 --> 01:52:26.840
I don't know, is there another German band

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.549
that can go play all over the world
and sell out arenas?

01:52:29.708 --> 01:52:30.630
In America?!?

01:52:31.542 --> 01:52:35.088
And we were cordially invited to the show,
and it was amazing to watch,

01:52:35.089 --> 01:52:38.053
because more than 10 years earlier,
we played right down the street

01:52:38.208 --> 01:52:42.543
with 'Rammstein', , and we were one of
20 or 30 people watching 'Rammstein, '

01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:47.051
and now we are one
of like 20 or 30,000 watching 'Rammstein'

01:52:47.208 --> 01:52:49.176
<i>Pram -
ax Madison Square Garden,</i>

01:52:49.333 --> 01:52:51.802
which is, you know, it is crazy! SURREAL!

01:52:51.958 --> 01:52:55.633
A bunch of German guys coming over to
America, it was sold out! It's about time!

01:52:55.792 --> 01:52:58.136
About time
the world embraces something like that!

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:14.299
They keep pushing the envelopes,
and nobody can copy them,

01:53:14.458 --> 01:53:18.463
and 'Rammstein' is still inspiring
young musicians, you know, it's...

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:22.002
they continue to tour,
they continue to put out music...

01:53:22.003 --> 01:53:23.877
It's just more fuel for the fire.

01:53:32.667 --> 01:53:35.671
What I noticed also about their show,
was that I thought was unique,

01:53:35.833 --> 01:53:38.712
was that they don't use any videoscreens.

01:53:38.875 --> 01:53:42.084
And we use screens, I mean most bands,
that's the thing, far away,

01:53:42.250 --> 01:53:44.594
people wanna look up at the screen.

01:54:08.333 --> 01:54:12.338
I personally would be afraid
of getting set on fire on a nightly basis.

01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:17.757
And my guitar player played with 'Rammstein'
on one show, and he didn't move!

01:54:17.917 --> 01:54:20.261
He just stood exactly
where they told him to stay

01:54:20.417 --> 01:54:23.591
and didn't move for the whole night,
and I don't blame him at all!

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.584
I'm low-budget!
I just turn around and show my ass crack!

01:54:37.542 --> 01:54:41.467
At the end of day they represent
everything that is rock'n'roll,

01:54:41.625 --> 01:54:44.959
but in a new way, that
no one has done before.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.380
I would say to any other band:
Do not go on after 'Rammstein?

01:56:28.875 --> 01:56:30.969
To be a German band singing in German,

01:56:31.125 --> 01:56:35.710
to be embraced by an American audience,
I would tell you it's impossible.

01:56:36.792 --> 01:56:40.376
And yet, clearly through their success,
it's not.

01:56:41.125 --> 01:56:44.129
Which leads me all the way back
to where we started talking.

01:56:44.292 --> 01:56:46.545
There is a level
of authenticity in their music

01:56:46.708 --> 01:56:49.336
and their style and their show
and what they're presenting

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:52.754
that people are relating to.
And it doesn't matter about their culture,

01:56:52.917 --> 01:56:55.966
it doesn't matter about
what language they speak, they can feel it.

01:56:56.792 --> 01:56:59.420
I couldn't tell you how to do that
in a million years.

01:57:25.958 --> 01:57:30.464
I'd just never seen them
so happy and in such a good place

01:57:30.833 --> 01:57:35.543
and I think that's what happens
when you wait for success to come to you.

01:57:45.958 --> 01:57:50.839
What I learned from it was that we
really tried for a certain period of time

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.719
to establish ourselves here,
with a lot of dedication,

01:57:53.875 --> 01:57:55.297
but nothing ever came of it.

01:57:55.458 --> 01:57:57.756
Only once we were really relaxed about it,

01:57:57.917 --> 01:57:59.005
so typical 'Rammstein, '

01:57:59.006 --> 01:58:02.049
always when we try to will something
into happening, it never works,

01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:04.176
but when we don't want anything,
we get it all.

01:58:45.292 --> 01:58:48.006
The feeling of being from Germany
or being German

01:58:48.007 --> 01:58:51.550
always had a stain on it
that I could sense in some way.

01:58:51.708 --> 01:58:55.041
You always felt somehow guilty.

01:58:55.042 --> 01:58:57.761
And in America I didn't have that anymore.

01:58:57.917 --> 01:58:59.965
People were more open,

01:59:00.167 --> 01:59:05.253
and suddenly certain German virtues
were seen as good.

01:59:05.417 --> 01:59:12.585
Reliability and punctuality
and things like that were appreciated here.

01:59:12.750 --> 01:59:17.961
And for the first time, I really got
a feel for my own home country.

01:59:18.125 --> 01:59:22.210
I had to leave first in order to be OK with
where I come from.

01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:25.424
It was a beautiful experience for me.
