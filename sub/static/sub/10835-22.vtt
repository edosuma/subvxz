WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.086
Previously on 90210...

00:03.211 --> 00:05.088
This is my sister.
This is Jen.

00:05.213 --> 00:06.507
Do you really want
to live together?

00:06.632 --> 00:09.426
Absolutely. For real.
Where do you want to live?

00:09.551 --> 00:12.220
I can't go to prom. I can't
deal with West Beverly kids yet.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.723
I'm pregnant, and
it's your baby.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.183
Are you trying
to ruin my life, Ade?

00:16.308 --> 00:18.226
You are a volcano.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.521
This whole good girl
routine-- it's just a mask.

00:20.646 --> 00:23.440
And when you finally can't take
it anymore, and you explode,

00:23.565 --> 00:24.984
it's gonna be fantastic.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.568
I would enjoy having dinner
with you.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.696
How about tomorrow night?
Why the hell not?

00:28.821 --> 00:30.405
I don't want to be some
booty call. I'm not the type

00:30.531 --> 00:32.115
of girl you run into
at a Chinese restaurant

00:32.240 --> 00:33.575
and take into a bathroom.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.076
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?

00:35.202 --> 00:36.620
Really?
Really.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.246
We got the house.
Now the bank is saying

00:38.372 --> 00:40.332
that it might take up
to a week to sort out.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.209
I so don't want you
to have to pay with your money.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.460
But I don't mind.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.920
You're so sweet.

00:48.256 --> 00:51.301
(rock music playing)

00:51.426 --> 00:53.052
I thought the prom was fun,

00:53.178 --> 00:55.806
but this after-prom party's
even better!

00:58.767 --> 01:00.394
(music stops)

01:00.519 --> 01:02.855
HARRY:
This year, after-prom parties
will lead

01:02.980 --> 01:05.065
to very serious consequences.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.277
All joking aside,

01:09.403 --> 01:12.406
I have a real message here
for the sophomore class.

01:12.531 --> 01:16.035
As you know, parties after
this year's junior prom led

01:16.159 --> 01:18.412
to one student being arrested
for a DUI,

01:18.537 --> 01:21.832
several others being treated for
alcohol poisoning.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.043
Which is why the school board,
in conjunction

01:24.167 --> 01:26.378
with the Beverly Hills
Police Department,

01:26.503 --> 01:29.506
has come up with a new policy
on after-prom parties.

01:33.301 --> 01:37.389
If you are caught
at an after-prom party

01:37.514 --> 01:41.351
where alcohol is being served,
you will be suspended.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.477
(people groaning)

01:42.603 --> 01:44.479
HARRY:
If you're suspended,

01:44.605 --> 01:46.481
you will have to go
to summer school.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.318
So, you're saying that one party
can ruin my whole summer?

01:52.696 --> 01:54.782
Yes, it can,
so think about the consequences.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.953
Attend the school-sanctioned
post-prom party only.

01:59.078 --> 02:02.873
Be smart and safe
on prom night.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.584
Okay.

02:05.709 --> 02:06.919
Okay, what were
you thinking?

02:07.044 --> 02:08.753
Oh, my dad begged me,
guilted me,

02:08.878 --> 02:11.673
and then promised to buy me
whatever prom dress I wanted.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.508
Well, I certainly hope
you're getting Chanel.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.510
Seriously. Not that
I have a prom date yet.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.428
Hey, Annie.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.471
(laughs)

02:17.596 --> 02:18.973
Hey.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.808
So, how do you know
the dorkasaurus?

02:20.933 --> 02:22.267
Charlie Pinkwater?
Mm-hmm.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.770
Oh, he is very big
in the world of stage crew.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.605
Mmm. Tasty.
Mm-hmm.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.441
Hey, uh, maybe Charlie Pinkwater
could take you to the prom.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.901
Shut up. No way!

02:31.026 --> 02:32.987
Oh, right. He probably
saw the video.

02:33.112 --> 02:34.905
Ugh. Am I ever
gonna live it down?

02:35.030 --> 02:36.615
Of course you
will, honey.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.575
I mean, Mariah Carey
got over Glitter, right?

02:38.700 --> 02:39.785
Not helping.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.912
Thank you.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.039
Thank you.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.963
What is this?

02:52.047 --> 02:54.549
It's a California Horn Shark.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.259
See the spots?

02:56.384 --> 02:58.637
The, uh, large
pectoral fins?

02:58.762 --> 03:00.097
Why didn't you take the test?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.223
Well, it only counts
for 20% of your grade.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.475
I have an 85 average.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.769
So, even with a zero,
I'll still have a 68,

03:05.894 --> 03:06.937
which means I'll pass.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.106
I don't get you, Liam.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.190
I mean,
what are you trying to prove?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.944
You're clearly a smart kid,
you got a lot of potential.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.446
Why are you throwing it away?

03:16.571 --> 03:18.949
You know, it's too bad
I'm not from the inner city.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.409
Then you could inspire me
to win the Academic Decathlon

03:21.535 --> 03:22.786
with your tough but earnest

03:22.911 --> 03:25.789
coaching and wise platitudes
about life.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.709
(gasps) They could even make a
major motion picture out of it.

03:28.834 --> 03:29.960
You can go.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.298
O, Captain! My Captain!

03:35.423 --> 03:36.424
Very nice.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.054
What's up, man?
Hey.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.847
Mr. Matthews,
you wanted to see me?

03:41.972 --> 03:43.974
Yeah. I have great news.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.941
Can you follow me to
the living room, please?

03:53.067 --> 03:54.735
The couch
goes in here.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.278
Facing the fireplace
or facing the windows?

03:57.404 --> 03:58.446
The window.
Fireplace.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.698
The window.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.533
You want to always
prioritize the view.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.035
You have much to
learn, Grasshopper.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.578
I mean, I still
can't believe

04:04.703 --> 04:05.913
you wanted
to buy a white leather couch.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.790
(laughs)
God, you are so L.A.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.458
Hey, can I ask
your advice?
Yeah.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.586
No white leather
pants, either.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.629
Okay, so I'm sort of, whatever,
seeing this guy Liam.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.339
He likes me. I'm not sure
if he knows he likes me,

04:17.464 --> 04:18.759
but I know he likes me.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.178
He just has a really, really
bad case of relationship phobia.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.597
But I want him to go
to the prom with me.

04:23.722 --> 04:27.308
Ah. Well, if you want to get
a man to do what you want,

04:27.434 --> 04:29.310
you pull a Lysistrata.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.438
What's that,
like an inner thigh muscle?

04:31.563 --> 04:32.940
(laughs)
The play?

04:33.065 --> 04:35.400
By Aristophanes?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.485
Where women withhold sex
to get what they want.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.696
What if what they want is sex?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.198
(laughs)
Oh.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.450
You have a lot to learn,
Grasshopper.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.910
Oh, don't touch that!

04:45.035 --> 04:46.703
Uh, don't
touch that.

04:51.083 --> 04:54.461
Okay, so, do you want to be
good cop this time or bad cop?

04:54.586 --> 04:56.880
I was the bad cop
with David Harris last week.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.173
That was your bad cop?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.674
I thought
you were being the good cop.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.636
What? No. That was the bad cop
with a heart of gold.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.013
Oh, is that what that was?
(knocking at door)

05:05.139 --> 05:06.765
Okay, I am gonna
be bad cop.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.476
Yes. Yes.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.394
Wow. Both of you.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.772
I had no idea
I could expect a threesome.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.566
Sit down, Liam.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.944
(sighs)

05:19.069 --> 05:20.028
Is this about Matthews?

05:20.154 --> 05:21.655
Because I'm telling you,

05:21.780 --> 05:24.407
that man does not
appreciate art.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.576
I will cut
to the chase.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.536
Your father called us yesterday.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.704
Oh, wow.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.540
Oh, I haven't talked to him
in... ten years.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.708
What'd he say?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.085
Where's he been?

05:35.210 --> 05:37.129
Oh.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.922
Were you referring
to my stepdad?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.382
Right. Your stepfather.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.801
He's concerned
about you, Liam.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.219
(scoffs)

05:44.343 --> 05:46.096
He thinks that you are detached,
antisocial.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.931
Not committed to this school.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.933
"Committed" being
the operative word.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.019
This isn't a joke, Liam.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.394
He requested your records.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.189
He's looking
at military schools.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.149
God, you don't want to go
to a military school.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.817
You know what?
Maybe he does.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.068
I have brochures.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.611
No, Kel,
he doesn't need those.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.404
Look, there's not much time

06:03.530 --> 06:05.032
left before the end
of the year, hmm?

06:05.157 --> 06:06.574
You make a little effort,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.618
study hard for your finals,
bring up your grades...

06:08.743 --> 06:10.704
Oh. Here we go.

06:10.829 --> 06:11.913
Show willingness
to get involved

06:12.039 --> 06:13.581
with the community
here at West Beverly.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.126
How? Join the pep squad?

06:16.251 --> 06:17.961
Student Council?
The Wildcat Crooners?

06:18.086 --> 06:20.839
Frankly, any of those things
could help at this point.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.424
He just needs to see
that you're making an effort.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.384
Plenty of options.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.810
So, how tan do you want to go?

06:33.935 --> 06:35.103
I'm not sure.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.688
I've never done this before.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.148
My friends just said

06:38.273 --> 06:39.482
everybody goes tanning
before prom.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.692
Oh, it's for prom?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.361
Why didn't you just say so?

06:42.485 --> 06:46.156
All right, we'll go
with Weekend in Barbados.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.741
As long as it's not too dark.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.159
I don't want to look silly
or anything.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.660
Oh, you won't look silly.

06:50.785 --> 06:51.995
You'll look awesome.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.748
Oh, God, I love proms.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.666
Are you psyched?

06:56.791 --> 07:00.045
Yeah. I'm just not
the most experienced prom-goer.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.838
Turn around, bum to me.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.801
Well, you came
to the right person.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.803
All right,
here's what you need to do.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.723
You need to get your hair
blown out, your eyebrows done.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.474
You have to get acrylic nails.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.060
Nails? Really?

07:15.185 --> 07:17.812
Well, yeah. You don't want
to stand out, do you?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.814
No. Definitely not.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.899
Okay, good.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.483
Now, let's see.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.902
The day of...

07:24.027 --> 07:25.904
This is very important.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.031
Shave everywhere.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.243
Okay.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.330
(phone ringing)

07:36.790 --> 07:38.708
Oh.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.796
Hello?

07:42.921 --> 07:43.880
What's up?

07:44.005 --> 07:45.382
Oh, not much.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.175
Just reading a classic
Greek play.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.470
So, listen, do you want to go
to the prom with me?

07:52.222 --> 07:55.016
Um...

07:55.142 --> 07:57.727
yeah, sure.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.646
Cool.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.689
So, look, I'll talk to you
tomorrow, all right?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.566
Yeah. Sounds good.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.116
(screaming)

08:11.241 --> 08:13.785
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

08:13.910 --> 08:17.080
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

08:37.267 --> 08:39.059
Take your seats.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.770
Seats, everybody!

08:41.895 --> 08:44.358
Put your tucheses
in your chairs

08:44.483 --> 08:47.027
if you know
what's good for your health.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.779
(Annie sighs)

08:49.904 --> 08:52.949
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.701
What is that
supposed to mean?

08:54.826 --> 08:56.577
Nothing. Just wondering
how long it's gonna take

08:56.703 --> 08:58.788
for you
to drop the nice girl act.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.708
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe it's not an act?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.251
Maybe I'm just a nice person?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.086
Not really.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.171
(scoffs)
Tick, tock.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.965
Tick, tock.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.719
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
could you all pick a partner?

09:12.844 --> 09:14.137
(whispers):
Oh. You and me?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.972
CHARLIE:
Hey, Annie?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.598
Do you have a partner?

09:17.724 --> 09:18.599
Nope.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.146
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
the first part of CPR...

09:23.271 --> 09:26.441
Hey, so, I happened to
hear through the grapevine

09:26.566 --> 09:28.818
that you might
be prom eligible.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.153
What?

09:30.278 --> 09:31.988
All of which is a
long introduction

09:32.113 --> 09:34.991
to a-a question
I'd like to pose.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.784
(clears throat)

09:36.910 --> 09:38.995
That, uh, question being:

09:39.120 --> 09:41.664
uh, would you
possibly want to go

09:41.789 --> 09:44.376
to the sophomore
prom, uh, with me?

09:44.501 --> 09:48.796
...which brings us
to the ABCs of CPR.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.590
Yes.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.676
Sure, Charlie. I would love
to go to prom with you.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.136
I would be thrilled.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.013
(laughs)
Thrilled.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.100
IRVING:
You're gonna tap for the
response, and then...

10:09.234 --> 10:11.236
Uh, hey, come on.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.737
Pretty sharp, huh?
No.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.072
Girls-- I'm telling you,

10:14.197 --> 10:15.865
are not into
that flashy stuff.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.867
They just want it
simple, classy,

10:17.992 --> 10:19.911
like James Bond.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.079
All right, fine.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.914
Would James Bond use a cane?

10:23.039 --> 10:24.124
No! He would not.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.750
No. Hey,

10:25.875 --> 10:27.085
so, uh, I got picked

10:27.210 --> 10:28.878
for the All-American Lacrosse
Camp this summer.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.671
Shut up!

10:30.797 --> 10:32.715
That's-- you know what?

10:32.840 --> 10:35.218
I'm so impressed, I-I can't
even be jealous.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.844
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

10:36.970 --> 10:37.929
Cool?

10:38.054 --> 10:39.097
You're set, man.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.266
There's scouts all
over that camp.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.268
They see you, you get recruited,

10:43.393 --> 10:46.438
you get a scholarship
to any college you want.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.066
Damn, bro, your whole life,
it-it just got figured out.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.985
I guess.
I mean, I was just

10:52.110 --> 10:53.736
planning on
going to Montana this summer.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.572
You know, visit my dad.
Take a road trip.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.366
But now it's going to be nothing
but wind sprints

10:58.492 --> 10:59.867
and shooting drills for me.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.286
Sounds pretty amazing
to me.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.912
SILVER:
What sounds amazing?

11:03.037 --> 11:04.747
Hi.
Hey.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.417
Mr. Ethan, here,
just got tapped

11:07.542 --> 11:10.170
for the All-American
Lacrosse Camp.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.712
What?!

11:11.838 --> 11:12.922
That is amazing!

11:13.047 --> 11:15.175
I forget sometimes
you're like King Jock.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.093
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.719
Uh, anyway, I'm going
to head out.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.805
Well, how goes the online
tux shopping?

11:20.930 --> 11:22.932
You guys got accessories
and whatever picked out?

11:23.057 --> 11:24.100
Oh, well, I'm
not going.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.519
But I think we got
Dixon all squared away.

11:25.644 --> 11:26.978
What do you mean
you're not going?

11:27.103 --> 11:28.938
Uh, I don't have a date.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.940
Well, you should
just go with us!

11:31.065 --> 11:32.108
I mean, you don't
need a date.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.318
We're all basically
going as a group.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.777
DIXON:
Yeah. We've got

11:34.902 --> 11:36.446
a pretty sick ride.
Come on.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.198
I could really use
the moral support.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.991
Please.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.201
Yeah.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.327
Yeah, sure.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.329
Uh, see you
guys later.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.997
All right, man.
Hey, yo.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.415
I'm, uh, I'm going to get you
this top hat, all right?

11:47.541 --> 11:49.167
Uh, no, please do not.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.251
What is this?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.419
He-he asked for it.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.338
He said--
You are not--

11:53.463 --> 11:55.048
You are not going...
He said I should go
for that T-Pain look.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.257
Uh-uh.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.300
All right, only you.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.426
Only you can
pull it off.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.844
DIXON:
I-I could pull it off.
I think I can.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.683
We are going to Navid's, Dad.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.976
His parents are going to be
there. It's not a party.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.020
I am not asking you
to be a tattletale.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.814
I am just saying that if there
is an illegal non-school

12:11.939 --> 12:13.316
sponsored after-party,
I think

12:13.441 --> 12:14.817
that you should tell me
about it.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.319
Harry.
What?

12:16.444 --> 12:17.487
Come on, sweetheart, this is

12:17.612 --> 12:19.155
a Beverly Hills party
we are talking about.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.323
I grew up here.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.324
I went to these parties

12:21.449 --> 12:23.243
and there were drugs,

12:23.368 --> 12:24.869
sex, booze.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.122
What'd I miss?
ANNIE:
Oh!

12:28.248 --> 12:30.833
You know, just Dad telling
an intoxicating story

12:30.958 --> 12:32.877
about his degenerate peers.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.671
And I do mean
intoxicating.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.423
Honey, Silver
could've stayed for dinner.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.258
Oh, um, no, no.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.593
It's-it's-- I know,

12:39.718 --> 12:41.386
she had a lot of homework
and stuff.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.012
Did you find a tux?

12:43.137 --> 12:45.014
Yeah. You know,
it's pretty boring, though.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.933
But it's cool.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.851
All I care about is Silver
having a good time.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.395
If she has a
good time,

12:50.520 --> 12:53.440
and she sees West Bev
isn't such a bad place--

12:53.565 --> 12:55.858
I bet she'll come back
to school next year!

12:55.983 --> 12:57.026
Yeah, well,

12:57.151 --> 12:58.528
I hope it works out.
I just don't

12:58.653 --> 13:00.071
want you to get your hopes up.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.239
(chuckles)

13:01.364 --> 13:02.532
I appreciate it, Mom.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.117
But don't worry about me.
I got this.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.243
I got this.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.328
So, Dixon,

13:07.454 --> 13:09.664
where were you saying that
after-prom party was again?

13:11.165 --> 13:12.166
(laughing)

13:12.292 --> 13:13.834
(laughing)

13:16.045 --> 13:17.922
Okay, this...

13:18.047 --> 13:20.467
is so... pretty.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.176
Eh, too sweet for me.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.928
I'll try it.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.098
Thanks.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.892
I don't imagine that you have
any maternity prom dresses?

13:30.017 --> 13:30.893
Well, of course.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.145
Come here.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.896
You know what you
should do?
What?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.898
Call Jaws like the last
possible moment,

13:36.023 --> 13:37.233
tell him you're sick,

13:37.358 --> 13:38.318
then you can find another date.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.569
He'll never know.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.112
I am not saying that I'm sick.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.071
(sighs)

13:42.196 --> 13:43.239
Becky.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.241
I can't decide.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.034
These all look
so good on me.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.453
I'm going to get
all of these,

13:48.578 --> 13:50.204
then ask Jen's
advice later.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.039
No problem.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.916
Oh, credit card.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.337
Okay, ladies.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.546
What do you think?

13:58.672 --> 14:00.256
(Annie sighs)

14:00.381 --> 14:02.175
It's so pretty.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.884
But not you.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.886
I'm really just going
for Dixon.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.181
I don't want to stand out.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.433
(exhaling)

14:10.558 --> 14:12.519
Okay, I'm going to go
try on my dress.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.395
Oh, shoes.
ANNIE:
Oh!

14:14.521 --> 14:17.190
NAOMI:
You know what
we could do?

14:17.315 --> 14:19.108
Hmm?
Run over your legs
with my car.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.152
Ugh, enough. Okay?

14:21.277 --> 14:24.322
I'm not exactly crazy about
your prom date either, FYI.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.615
(clears throat)

14:25.740 --> 14:27.617
You know what, Annie?
You need to get on board.

14:27.742 --> 14:30.203
Liam is clearly over
his commitment issues.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.330
Why else would he have
invited me to come with him?

14:32.455 --> 14:33.914
You're right.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.041
I'm sorry.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.084
I'm just glad that
you're happy.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.253
I am.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.255
Hey, Naomi,

14:41.381 --> 14:42.507
had a bit of a problem.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.510
Your card was
declined.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.142
NAOMI:
Jen?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.478
Don't track mud
on the rugs.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.355
Jen, I need to ask you
something.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.357
Oh, wait! First,

14:59.482 --> 15:01.234
let me show you my...

15:02.652 --> 15:04.404
...prom dress!

15:04.529 --> 15:06.322
Your what?

15:06.447 --> 15:08.324
Ryan Matthews asked me
to be his date.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.992
I thought I'd go as a lark.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.160
Anyway, how hilarious is it

15:11.285 --> 15:13.162
to wear couture
to the sophomore prom?

15:13.287 --> 15:14.664
Yeah, pretty hilarious.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.208
Listen, Jen, my Amex was
declined today.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.168
I called our business
manager,

15:19.293 --> 15:21.003
she said I reached my limit.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.047
I didn't know the card
even had a limit.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.925
Oh, my God, how mortifying.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.598
Um, I didn't know I was
paying for everything.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.600
I mean, the-the furniture,

15:33.725 --> 15:35.476
the paintings,
the couture.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.812
It all went on my card,
didn't it?

15:40.147 --> 15:42.692
I'm sorry.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.694
I don't get it,
I-I thought you worked out

15:44.819 --> 15:46.362
the whole wiring money business.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.238
What's going on?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.240
(sighs)

15:49.365 --> 15:52.118
Oh, God. Um...

15:52.243 --> 15:55.162
the truth is I lied to you.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.458
This is so
embarrassing.

15:58.583 --> 16:02.503
Um, I'm in a bit of a
pinch financially.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.715
I invested in the market
at the wrong time.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.425
But it-it'll all turn
around, I mean,

16:07.550 --> 16:09.594
the market is looking up.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.554
Yes?

16:11.679 --> 16:15.224
But in the short term...

16:15.349 --> 16:18.102
I'm a bit strapped.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.607
I'm sorry.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.026
I am truly...

16:26.152 --> 16:28.988
truly sorry.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.492
(sighs)

16:32.617 --> 16:33.493
It's okay.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.411
I just--

16:35.536 --> 16:37.246
Why did you lie to me?

16:37.371 --> 16:40.333
I, um...

16:42.585 --> 16:45.463
I'm the big sister.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.465
I wanted to take care of you.

16:47.590 --> 16:51.552
I didn't want you to have
to take care of me.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.187
I'm glad to help.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.147
I really am.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.776
But...

17:06.901 --> 17:09.444
if I am paying for everything,

17:09.569 --> 17:12.448
then I get to choose the couch.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.282
We're going with white leather.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.830
deciding whether or not
to raise the baby.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.581
He should know
about that.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.625
He should know what
it's been like.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.877
And I'm gonna tell him that
right now.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.838
Ow! Ow.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.756
Ow. Ow. Ow.
You all right?

Hey, have a seat.
Uh...

Whoo! I'm-I'm--
I'm fine.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.472
It's just a false
labor pain.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.474
You know, there's a difference

19:43.599 --> 19:46.477
between false labor pains
and fake labor pains.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.271
Just ignore Ty.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.569
CHARLIE:
That's really unfair.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.529
You should be up
there!

19:56.654 --> 19:57.697
Oh, no, no.

19:57.822 --> 19:58.823
Really, that's okay.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.366
No, you should be.

You're one of the five prettiest
girls at West Bev.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.027
Um... uh, yes, we dated.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.654
Briefly a while ago.

24:48.779 --> 24:49.696

And I don't just
mean teachers.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.370
When I was at Yale,
I briefly dated

24:56.494 --> 24:58.622
someone in the
Registrar's office.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.458
You don't say.
Mmm.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.042
He was pretty much
a bore, actually.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.377
Although I did get to read

25:03.501 --> 25:05.963
my, uh, recommendation
letters from high school.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.840
That was sweet.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.259
Most of them were
rather glowing.

25:10.384 --> 25:12.011
There was one, though,

25:12.136 --> 25:14.263
that was slightly
less than glowing.

25:14.388 --> 25:15.764
I wrote that letter

25:15.889 --> 25:18.351
because it's my job
to give the colleges

25:18.476 --> 25:20.811
an honest appraisal
of the students.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.313
Uh-huh.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.023
You said that, in your opinion,

25:24.148 --> 25:26.650
I was "a narcissist
with no moral compass."

25:26.775 --> 25:27.776
(laughing)

25:27.901 --> 25:29.278
Did you really think

25:29.403 --> 25:31.113
Yale was gonna listen to you?

25:31.238 --> 25:33.324
A guidance counselor?

25:33.449 --> 25:34.950
I had an impeccable transcript.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.952
I was president
of the senior class.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.996
I'm a legacy.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.414
I got in early.

out of the teacher's desk,
