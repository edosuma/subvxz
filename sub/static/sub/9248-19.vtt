WEBVTT

00:04.787 --> 00:06.093
So, how'd
the date go last night?

00:06.180 --> 00:08.269
Ah, another bait and switch.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.227
Her profile picture
looked like Halle Berry,

00:10.314 --> 00:12.708
but what showed up and ordered
Maine lobster was Chuck Berry.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.057
[laughs]

00:14.144 --> 00:15.580
Well, sorry it didn't work out.

00:15.667 --> 00:18.888
Oh, I didn't say that.
Real nice lady.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.368
Yeah, we-we're gonna go
out to karaoke next week.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.718
You know, she's got
Mr. Berry's face.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.025
Let's see
if she's got his pipes.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.679
Hang on, we got
a car up on the curb.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.029
All right, I'll grab
the Breathalyzer.

00:29.116 --> 00:32.162
[siren chirps]I'll put on my shoes.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.694
Is she drunk or dead?

00:42.781 --> 00:45.088
Well, either way,
she can't park here.

00:45.175 --> 00:46.046
Ma'am?

00:52.748 --> 00:53.836
Glad you're here, Officer.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.621
I'm looking for my car.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.970
Aren't you in it?

00:59.233 --> 01:02.149
[laughs]

01:02.236 --> 01:04.586
Look at that, that's like
when you lose your sunglasses,

01:04.673 --> 01:07.893
and they're on top of your head.

01:07.980 --> 01:11.071
Oh, have a nice day.

01:11.158 --> 01:15.075
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Turn it off, turn it off.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.293
Okay, I'm gonna need
to see your license

01:16.380 --> 01:17.338
and registration, please.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.949
I can't do that.Why not?

01:20.036 --> 01:22.256
'Cause I don't have it.Well, where is it?

01:22.343 --> 01:23.692
That's a question.
You should ask the judge

01:23.779 --> 01:26.390
who took it away from me.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.783
All right, I'm gonna have
to ask you to step

01:27.870 --> 01:28.784
out of the vehicle, please.

01:28.871 --> 01:29.741
Well, just what is this

01:29.828 --> 01:31.221
all about, Officer?

01:31.308 --> 01:33.267
This is about driving
under the influence.

01:33.354 --> 01:34.529
Well, I didn't drive, I parked.

01:34.616 --> 01:35.878
I mean, technically I stopped

01:35.965 --> 01:36.922
a crime from happening.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.924
You're welcome.

01:39.011 --> 01:41.884
Well, it doesn't matter
that you're stopped.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.538
What matters is
you've admitted to drinking.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.844
And your keys
are in the ignition.

01:45.931 --> 01:48.934
Oh, so, if I didn't
have the keys

01:49.021 --> 01:51.894
then I would just
be sleeping it off?

01:53.635 --> 01:55.027
That's correct.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.639
There we go.

01:59.249 --> 02:01.121
Nighty-night, Officers.

Ooh, more!
[kissing]

02:36.547 --> 02:39.724
All right, all right!

02:39.811 --> 02:41.378
Ms. Small,
let's try this again.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.206
Do you still live at 627 Racine?

02:43.293 --> 02:46.166
I feel sorry for you.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.081
I'm not the one in handcuffs.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.909
Oh, yes, you are. You
work for the government.

02:50.996 --> 02:51.519
You're a pawn in a game you
don't even know you're in.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.260
[sighs]

02:53.347 --> 02:56.263
All right, so I'm just gonna
mark that as a "yes"

02:56.350 --> 02:57.960
for 627 Racine.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.701
What did you want to
be a cop for anyway?

02:59.788 --> 03:01.485
You think people would
respect you more?

03:01.572 --> 03:04.184
Well, let me let you in
on a little secret.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.447
They don't.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.883
Think what you want.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.450
Oh, no ring on your finger.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.929
Obviously you have women
issues. Who was it?

03:11.016 --> 03:13.541
Who was it? Was it
your mom that hurt you?

03:13.628 --> 03:15.238
Was it your mom?
Was she the one?

03:15.325 --> 03:16.935
Is that who hurt you?

03:17.022 --> 03:20.112
Aw, is that who hurt you?
Your mommy hurt you?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.592
What happened?

03:21.679 --> 03:23.507
[voice quivering]:
You don't know me.

03:25.161 --> 03:27.903
Oh, now I do.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.861
All right, all right!
Carl, take a break.

03:29.948 --> 03:32.516
And you, leave him alone.

03:32.603 --> 03:34.388
Bye-bye, mama's boy.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.001
Hey.[Carl sniffling]

03:39.088 --> 03:40.568
All right, where is she?

03:40.655 --> 03:42.134
Over there.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.745
Are you kidding me?

03:43.832 --> 03:45.529
You handcuffed one
of our greatest living authors?

03:45.616 --> 03:47.270
She's also a very nasty drunk

03:47.357 --> 03:49.141
who kept throwing Carl's
hat across the room.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.188
I mean, it-it was funny once.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.321
So, there's nobody
that'll come get her?

03:54.408 --> 03:57.367
No, I contacted her
attorney, cab companies.

03:57.454 --> 03:58.890
You'd be surprised
how many people hang up

03:58.977 --> 04:00.240
when they hear her name.

04:00.327 --> 04:00.892
Okay, I got this.

04:00.979 --> 04:01.545
Okay.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.634
No, no!

04:03.721 --> 04:05.680
Nobody wants to
hear from you.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.857
Hey.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.467
Hey, are you
the lucky policewoman

04:10.554 --> 04:13.644
who gets to cavity search me?
I love that.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.124
No, it's me. Molly?

04:15.211 --> 04:16.952
The-the writer?
You mentored me?

04:17.039 --> 04:18.562
I kind of stalked you.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.085
Oh, yeah!

04:20.172 --> 04:21.957
Now I remember.
We made out a little bit.

04:22.044 --> 04:22.784
What?

04:22.871 --> 04:24.612
No, no.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.657
No.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.834
So...

04:29.921 --> 04:32.533
You're having yourself
quite a day here, huh?

04:32.620 --> 04:36.841
Well, I was till Pork and Beans
dragged me in here.

04:36.928 --> 04:40.062
Well, I'm kind
of married to Pork.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.542
The oversensitive black guy?

04:41.629 --> 04:43.631
Oh, no, then Beans.

04:43.718 --> 04:44.806
Oh.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.723
Makes more sense.Yeah.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.202
Well, I see
you're getting out soon.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.726
I'd be happy
to give you a ride home.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.380
Oh, that would be so nice.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.817
We, uh, we took
a bath together, didn't we?

04:55.904 --> 04:57.079
After we made out?

04:57.166 --> 04:57.775
No, we did not.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.821
We did not.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.039
No.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.130
Can you just tone down
on the lesbian stuff?

05:05.217 --> 05:06.088
My husband's right there.

05:06.175 --> 05:06.871
Oh, guys love that.

05:06.958 --> 05:10.484
Well, not Beans.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.529
All right, well,
shall we get out of here?

05:14.444 --> 05:16.968
[coughs]
I got her, I got her.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.062
Okay, uh,

05:24.149 --> 05:25.629
can I get you anything
before I go?

05:25.716 --> 05:27.065
No, but thanks again
for the ride.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.981
Maybe I could fix you
some lunch.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.461
Uh, no.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.464
I'm kind of more
of a soup and salad gal.

05:34.551 --> 05:37.424
Well, you can't forget about
your childhood by eating salad.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.297
Okay, uh...

05:41.384 --> 05:43.255
All right, well, I should...

05:43.343 --> 05:46.084
I should probably go and get...

05:46.171 --> 05:49.436
get out of you hair,
and I'm gonna...

05:49.523 --> 05:51.220
Hey, what are you doing?

05:51.307 --> 05:52.961
I'm, uh, I was, uh,

05:53.048 --> 05:55.137
trying to...
I was snooping.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.617
I was snooping.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.227
Is that your new book?

05:58.314 --> 06:01.535
No, it's 600 pages of crap.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.101
Well, I mean,
but it's your crap,

06:03.188 --> 06:05.452
so it's, it's probably
pretty good crap.

06:05.539 --> 06:06.496
Are we done here?[phone ringing]

06:06.583 --> 06:07.541
Uh...

06:07.628 --> 06:08.542
Yup, sure.

06:08.629 --> 06:11.501
I'll just let you get to it.

06:11.588 --> 06:12.589
Okay. Probably gonna get that.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.635
No.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.941
You gonna let
the machine get it or...?

06:17.028 --> 06:18.595
No machine.

06:18.682 --> 06:19.466
Okay, probably
voice mail or a serv...Nope.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.598
Okay!

06:21.685 --> 06:23.470
All right.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.560
You know what?
I actually can't do that.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.562
J.C. Small's residence.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.652
Okay. Just-just a moment.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.088
It's your publisher.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.698
Tell him I'm dead.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.787
I-I can't, I can't do that.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.355
Well, I can't do it, I'm dead.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.444
Uh, Ms. Small can't come
to the phone right now.

06:41.531 --> 06:44.882
Can I take a message, please?

06:44.969 --> 06:46.493
Okay.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.625
"Miserable drunk."

06:48.712 --> 06:51.411
Okay.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.587
"Disgrace to profession."

06:53.674 --> 06:55.327
Okay.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.070
And "where is the... where,
where is the damn book?"

06:59.157 --> 07:02.596
"Book." Okay, got it.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.686
Well, the good news is

07:05.773 --> 07:07.383
your publisher sounds

07:07.470 --> 07:10.081
very passionate
about that book.

07:10.168 --> 07:12.519
Well, the bad news is
it's never gonna be finished.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.434
Don't say that.
I mean,

07:14.521 --> 07:16.000
you're J.C. Small, you know?

07:16.087 --> 07:18.742
I mean, two-time
National Book Award winner.

07:18.829 --> 07:21.745
And greatest feminist voice
of our generation. I mean,

07:21.832 --> 07:22.703
that voice is
in those pages somewhere.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.705
We just have to find it.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.446
"We"?

07:26.533 --> 07:29.187
I mean, I-I ca...
I-I could help you.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.712
[phone ringing]

07:39.154 --> 07:39.720
Gonna get that?

07:39.807 --> 07:41.635
Yes, yes!

07:41.722 --> 07:43.593
J.C. Small's residence.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.552
Hold please.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.858
Are we happy
with our phone service provider?

07:47.945 --> 07:48.859
Ecstatic.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.295
Okay!

07:50.382 --> 07:52.907
Yes!

07:55.779 --> 07:58.347
Hey.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.914
Hey. It's midnight.
Where you been?

08:00.001 --> 08:02.177
Oh, just helping

08:02.264 --> 08:04.266
a world-famous author
work on her novel.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.268
Me, Molly Flynn--

08:06.355 --> 08:08.618
ex-school teacher,
notary public,

08:08.705 --> 08:10.577
muse.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.971
I didn't know you were a notary.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.104
J.C. is a mad genius.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.541
I suggested putting a comma
in one of her sentences

08:18.628 --> 08:20.325
and she practically
tore my head off.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.545
I'm sorry, I should've never
called you to come pick her up.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.025
What? No, no, no, no.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.069
It was amazing.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.114
I mean, I got cursed out

08:26.201 --> 08:27.985
by my literary idol.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.552
I mean, she called names I've
never even heard of before.

08:29.639 --> 08:30.597
Then she put in my comma.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.642
Mike, I'm on the page.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.298
Well, that's great.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.429
I'm sure it's
the best part of the book.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.170
Oh, no.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.650
I mean, I did really simplify
a sentence, but...

08:40.737 --> 08:41.956
[cell phone ringing]

08:42.043 --> 08:43.131
Oh!

08:43.218 --> 08:44.088
Ooh, it's J.C.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.742
Send it to voice mail.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.309
Would you send your
idol to voice mail?

08:47.396 --> 08:48.919
Why would
Mike Ditka call me?

08:49.006 --> 08:50.268
I'll just be a second.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.748
Hi, J.C.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.402
Wait, wait.
Okay, wait a minute.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.796
Wait a minute.
Slow down, slow down.

08:55.883 --> 08:59.669
I-I thought what you
wrote today was great.

08:59.756 --> 09:02.019
Well, I give a rat's ass
about what I say.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.151
Just hang up.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.195
[shushes]

09:04.282 --> 09:05.327
Now?

09:05.414 --> 09:08.243
Well, it's awfully late.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.723
No, I'm not a little baby

09:09.810 --> 09:11.681
that needs her bed.

09:11.768 --> 09:15.729
No! No, no, no!
Don't take out my comma!

09:15.816 --> 09:17.905
Yeah, I'll be right there.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.733
Come on, you just got home.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.691
I know. She needs me. I'm sorry.

09:21.778 --> 09:22.823
Well, what about me?

09:22.910 --> 09:24.259
I haven't seen you all day.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.390
You're gonna be asleep
in five minutes.

09:25.477 --> 09:28.524
Three if you tickle my back.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.657
All right, turn on your side.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.876
Ooh!

09:32.963 --> 09:34.095
Ah, yeah!

09:34.182 --> 09:35.444
Ooh!

09:35.531 --> 09:36.532
Slower.

09:36.619 --> 09:39.579
Ooh. O-o-oh, o-o-oh.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.277
That's good.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.633
All right,
held my first husband.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.374
It should...

09:52.461 --> 09:54.724
do the trick for me.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.639
No, no, no, no, no,

09:56.726 --> 09:57.771
no, no, no, no, no!What? Whoa, oh! Oh!

09:57.858 --> 09:59.163
Aah!No, no, no!

09:59.250 --> 10:00.251
Down!

10:00.338 --> 10:01.775
Down! Get off of there!

10:01.862 --> 10:05.082
Down! Down!

10:05.169 --> 10:07.476
What were you thinking?

10:07.563 --> 10:08.999
I was thinking
about killing myself,

10:09.086 --> 10:10.914
but now all I can think about

10:11.001 --> 10:13.177
is how good you smell.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.570
What?

10:14.657 --> 10:15.353
How good you smell.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.354
I heard you.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.834
What?Well...

10:17.921 --> 10:20.010
Stop clenching me
with your thighs.

10:28.497 --> 10:31.631
I have some nice
chamomile tea for us.

10:31.718 --> 10:34.024
And I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

10:34.111 --> 10:37.898
but what is wrong with you?

10:37.985 --> 10:40.335
Okay, you probably can't
understand this right now,

10:40.422 --> 10:43.207
but one day,
if you work really hard

10:43.294 --> 10:45.209
and you're very good
and you never give up,

10:45.296 --> 10:46.689
you're gonna realize

10:46.776 --> 10:51.215
that suicide is easier
than writing.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.304
That is crazy
We did good work today.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.479
Yeah, but what
about the next day?

10:54.566 --> 10:56.046
And then the next day?

10:56.133 --> 10:57.395
You have to keep
feeding the beast.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.006
I mean, for what?

10:59.093 --> 11:00.398
To write a great book.Oh...

11:00.485 --> 11:01.922
And then they
want another one.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.706
Or they don't want one.
That's even worse.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.969
Well, if it's such torture,
then why bother at all?

11:06.056 --> 11:08.668
Because I hate them and
I want them to love me.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.194
I kind of get that.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.717
Oh, how can you
kind of get that?

11:14.804 --> 11:16.153
I taught fourth grade!

11:22.377 --> 11:24.161
Why'd you have
to bring her here?

11:24.248 --> 11:26.163
Because I've been with her
for 16 straight hours

11:26.250 --> 11:29.297
and I wanted to
take a shower.

11:29.384 --> 11:30.777
I was gonna do it
at her place,

11:30.864 --> 11:32.169
but she climbed
in there with me.

11:32.256 --> 11:35.738
I don't like
that stuff.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.784
I know, Beans.
I know.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.223
So, what is it you do?

11:42.310 --> 11:44.747
I work at a funeral home.

11:44.834 --> 11:45.835
Oh, mortician.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.054
Beautician.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.969
Interesting.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.753
So if your sister
had arrived five
minutes later,

11:50.840 --> 11:52.233
we probably still
would have met.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.757
Except I would have
been dead, of course.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.237
I thought we weren't supposed
to talk about the...

11:56.324 --> 11:57.238
[makes cracking sound]

11:57.325 --> 11:59.849
Oh, what's a little

11:59.936 --> 12:02.722
suicide attempt
among friends?

12:02.809 --> 12:04.636
Personally, I'd use pills.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.508
They're clean, easy.

12:06.595 --> 12:09.424
Plus, you go out doing
something you love.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.643
Now, I can't believe

12:11.731 --> 12:12.601
that you've ever thought
about ending your life.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.603
With a wonderful marriage

12:14.690 --> 12:16.170
and two beautiful daughters,

12:16.257 --> 12:18.346
all living peacefully
under the same roof.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.217
Well, we have
our moments.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.132
Especially in
the mornings, you know?

12:22.219 --> 12:23.394
Bathroom traffic.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.656
"Who-who took all
that hot water?"

12:24.744 --> 12:25.745
[laughing]

12:28.356 --> 12:30.619
I mean, when you think about it,

12:30.706 --> 12:32.186
you've given up so much
for these girls.

12:32.273 --> 12:36.016
Your life, your privacy,
your home.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.757
When is it gonna be
Joyce's turn, hmm?

12:37.844 --> 12:39.976
When does somebody
do something for you?

12:40.063 --> 12:41.543
I don't see it like that.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.110
Well, of course not.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.112
That's what the booze
is for, isn't it?

12:45.199 --> 12:46.156
MOLLY:
Okay...

12:46.243 --> 12:47.114
That's enough about us.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.855
What about you, huh?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.987
We all want to hear more
about the great J.C. Small.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.380
J.C.:
Oh, what can

12:52.467 --> 12:53.903
I tell you?
I don't know, my...

12:53.990 --> 12:55.426
I learned how to drink
from my father,

12:55.513 --> 12:57.080
I learned how to curse
from my mother

12:57.167 --> 12:59.517
and I learned how to make love
from my uncle.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.955
And I'm a Scorpio.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.130
I knew it.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.479
I mean, your sign.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.786
Not that other
horrible stuff.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.570
You are so cute.
[giggles]

13:08.657 --> 13:09.919
You single?

13:10.006 --> 13:11.529
Why, do you
know someone?

13:11.616 --> 13:13.575
Yes, I do.
MOLLY:
All righty!

13:13.662 --> 13:15.620
Ooh, have you tried
that prosciutto?

13:15.707 --> 13:16.796
No.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.319
Yeah, well, do.
Do it.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.016
Hey, just
to be clear,

13:20.103 --> 13:22.845
I am very happy with
my life and my children.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.108
They may be parasites,
but I still love 'em.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.154
Thank you, Mom.Thank you...
Mom.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.895
Well...

13:28.982 --> 13:30.548
of course you are, but what
about your poor husband?

13:30.635 --> 13:32.637
You've been married,
what, two years?

13:32.724 --> 13:34.030
You're practically
on your honeymoon.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.205
I bet you didn't
think you signed up

13:35.292 --> 13:36.685
for this full house, did you?

13:36.772 --> 13:38.208
Yeah, well,
what are you gonna do?

13:38.295 --> 13:40.254
Some women have those
yappy little dogs,

13:40.341 --> 13:44.214
Joyce has yappy
little daughters.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.955
And, just so you know, Mike
and I are moving out of here

13:46.042 --> 13:47.522
as soon as we get
a down payment together.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.306
Yeah, I'll believe
that when he flies.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.092
JOYCE:
Listen, as long as

13:52.179 --> 13:53.528
my name's on the deed,

13:53.615 --> 13:55.312
my parasites have a home.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.270
Uh, I'm your husband.
I don't have a say in this?

13:56.357 --> 13:57.575
Second husband.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.447
Our real daddy
is in heaven.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.275
Oh, I am
so sorry.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.452
It was 25 years ago,
move your hand.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.541
Ooh, very protective

14:06.628 --> 14:08.499
of the younger, sexy sister.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.674
Interesting.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.459
You know, even a strong man,

14:11.546 --> 14:13.069
you sit him in front of
a piece of cake long enough,

14:13.156 --> 14:15.332
he's gonna eat it.

14:15.419 --> 14:18.205
Was that a crack
about my weight?

14:18.292 --> 14:21.208
No, she's saying you want
to sleep with Victoria.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.339
What? Ugh!

14:22.426 --> 14:24.211
What's wrong
with me?

14:24.298 --> 14:26.691
Not a damn thing.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.651
Oh, so the stepfather noticed.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.262
What? Ew!

14:32.349 --> 14:33.350
You-you creeping on my daughter?

14:33.437 --> 14:35.483
No! What...

14:35.570 --> 14:37.398
None of this
is on me.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.879
She's the one who always
parades around in a towel.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.271
I don't even look.
Oh, yeah?

14:41.358 --> 14:43.012
Then how do you know
she's wearing a towel?

14:43.099 --> 14:44.535
'Cause I'm always
standing in line

14:44.622 --> 14:46.059
for the damn
crapper.
Oh...

14:46.146 --> 14:47.495
You need to pee?

14:47.582 --> 14:48.452
Use the drain
in the laundry room,

14:48.539 --> 14:49.758
you've done it before.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.499
Gross!
I go down there barefoot.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.414
Careful, 'cause Vince will
stare at your naked feet.

14:53.501 --> 14:54.458
Oh...

14:54.545 --> 14:55.720
JOYCE:
Please.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.461
You put it out there
for everybody.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.768
Why do you think
I keep buying you
robes for Christmas?

14:59.855 --> 15:01.465
I just kept thinking you were
buying me the same thing

15:01.552 --> 15:03.076
because you're getting old.

15:03.163 --> 15:07.167
Hey, I am a young,
vibrant woman.

15:07.254 --> 15:10.605
With a fantastic body
for a broad your age.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.520
What are you doing
looking at her body?She's my wife!

15:12.607 --> 15:13.477
VICTORIA:
Well, she's my mother!Are you happy?

15:13.564 --> 15:16.306
Yes, very!

15:16.393 --> 15:17.438
JOYCE:
Stay out of it.
You started all this.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.701
Don't yell at me!

15:19.788 --> 15:21.485
Okay, here
come the tears.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.835
Go ahead, manipulate your mother
like you always do.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.534
Okay, okay, let's everybody
just calm down.

15:26.621 --> 15:27.491
Shut up. You're not even
part of this family.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.840
Well, neither is he!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.625
Why you gotta
bring me into this?

15:30.712 --> 15:32.192
You're a shoe salesman!

15:32.279 --> 15:32.627
[yelling over each other]

15:36.500 --> 15:38.589
That was fun.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.678
What do you want
to do now?

15:40.765 --> 15:42.158
Get you home.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.421
I think I've had enough
of you for one day.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.945
You're gonna leave me alone?

15:46.032 --> 15:48.121
We could both use
a little break.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.992
You can't abandon me now.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.734
I'm very fragile!

15:52.821 --> 15:56.520
I have a feeling
you're gonna be okay.

15:56.607 --> 15:59.349
I tried to kill
myself last night.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.003
[scoffing]:
Yeah.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.787
What does "huh, huh" mean?

16:02.874 --> 16:04.050
Nothing.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.312
It's just so lucky

16:05.399 --> 16:06.966
that the moment of your crisis

16:07.053 --> 16:08.706
is exactly when I was
coming through your door,

16:08.793 --> 16:11.057
which happened to be
conveniently unlocked.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.928
So you think that was a bluff?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.844
Well, I'll just throw myself
out of this car right now.

16:15.931 --> 16:16.976
Really?
Really.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.369
Or, hey, I'll do you one better.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.676
Let me pull over here,
right by the river,

16:21.763 --> 16:23.373
and you can go drown yourself.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.766
Yeah.
Oh, look, we're here.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.942
Jump on out.
Jump out.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.335
River's waiting for you.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.728
Full of snakes
and dead mobsters.

16:30.815 --> 16:32.252
But you're not gonna do it.

16:32.339 --> 16:34.167
'Cause you know
as well as I know

16:34.254 --> 16:35.516
that you just create these
little dramatic situations

16:35.603 --> 16:37.648
because you need
the attention!

16:37.735 --> 16:40.695
Yeah. Oh, yeah, climb
up on that railing.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.088
Yeah, through that
leg over there.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.698
There you go.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.916
Yeah... oh, is this where
I'm supposed to come out

16:45.004 --> 16:46.005
and try to stop you?

16:46.092 --> 16:47.528
Well, I'm out.

16:47.615 --> 16:48.442
No, I'm sitting right...[water splashing]

16:48.529 --> 16:50.705
Son of a bitch!

16:53.403 --> 16:54.535
Hey!

16:54.622 --> 16:56.015
Don't you dare
swim away from me!

16:56.102 --> 16:58.147
[splashing]

17:04.762 --> 17:06.155
You could have gotten
us both killed.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.548
Don't be
so dramatic.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.941
Me? You jumped
in a river!

17:10.029 --> 17:13.206
Man, that water's always so much
colder than you remember.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.468
You did this before?

17:14.555 --> 17:16.600
Yeah, well,
usually from bridges.

17:16.687 --> 17:19.255
I prefer the one on Wacker.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.518
I mean, that view going down
is incredible.

17:21.605 --> 17:24.391
What is the
matter with you?

17:24.478 --> 17:27.394
"Bipolar sociopath."

17:27.481 --> 17:28.395
Oh, my God, really?

17:28.482 --> 17:29.570
Or, as I like to call it,

17:29.657 --> 17:31.833
the "up-down boohoo sillies."

17:31.920 --> 17:33.661
Can't they give you
anything for that?

17:33.748 --> 17:36.011
Yeah, they give me
lots of stuff,

17:36.098 --> 17:37.491
but they're no fun.

17:37.578 --> 17:40.407
Even when you crush them
and snort them.

17:40.494 --> 17:41.886
So you're off your meds?

17:41.973 --> 17:44.889
Duh. I jumped into the river.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.326
Okay, you...
you know what?

17:46.413 --> 17:47.544
I can't take
this anymore.

17:47.631 --> 17:48.937
Neither can I.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.852
What is so wrong
with your life, huh?

17:50.939 --> 17:52.288
I mean, you have
the kind of talent

17:52.375 --> 17:53.985
that I-I would chop off
my head to have.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.422
Why can't you just be happy?

17:55.509 --> 17:56.597
I can't write when I'm happy.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.947
Oh, that's a load of crap.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.862
Your talent is your talent
whether you're happy or not.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.081
It's in you.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.430
That's easy for you to say,

18:03.517 --> 18:03.647
because you don't have any.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.434
All right.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.653
That's
my cue.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.915
Where are
you going?

18:11.002 --> 18:12.003
I'm taking my lack of talent

18:12.091 --> 18:13.875
as far away from you as possible

18:13.962 --> 18:17.008
and going home to what little
I have of my happy family.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.401
You can't leave me.
I need you.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.447
You need to dry out
and suck it up

18:20.534 --> 18:21.622
and finish your book.

18:21.709 --> 18:22.666
Well, why don't you make me?

18:22.753 --> 18:23.537
Grow up!
I'll pay you.

18:23.624 --> 18:26.975
Sorry, what?

18:27.062 --> 18:29.673
Uh, $800 a week.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.935
Plus damages.

18:31.022 --> 18:33.373
Which I'm sure I will incur.

18:35.766 --> 18:36.593
So you're asking me
to help you write your book?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.595
Yeah.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.075
Write, run errands,

18:40.162 --> 18:42.817
induce vomiting
whenever necessary.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.037
I'm not saying yes.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.909
But if I did,

18:47.996 --> 18:49.606
no more midnight calls.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.608
No more midnight swims.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.001
Plus, you'd have
to go back on your meds

18:53.088 --> 18:57.440
because this
kind of crazy... no.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.007
Okay? Do you promise me?

18:59.094 --> 19:01.140
No.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.706
Well, then you're gonna have
to go find somebody...

19:02.793 --> 19:05.100
$1,000 a week.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.623
Done.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.277
But just to...

19:08.364 --> 19:09.670
get the taste of the river water
out of my mouth.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.672
You know what else
would do that?

19:12.716 --> 19:13.717
My tongue.

19:13.804 --> 19:17.025
And no more of that either.

19:17.112 --> 19:20.681
You sure?
Not even for $2,000 a week?

19:20.768 --> 19:22.857
No!

19:22.944 --> 19:24.467
Well...

19:24.554 --> 19:25.686
N-No. No.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.775
We'll see.

19:35.478 --> 19:36.827
[sighs]
Hey there.

19:36.914 --> 19:40.527
Hey. Mwah.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.268
[groans]
What is that smell?

19:42.355 --> 19:44.618
Oh. Chicago River.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.577
And a very aggressive
lesbian.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.057
What?

19:49.144 --> 19:51.494
Oh, I had to
fish out J.C.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.453
You know, for as polluted
as that water is,

19:53.540 --> 19:55.237
it was oddly refreshing.

19:55.324 --> 19:59.981
Molly, what-what kind of hold
does this woman have on you?

20:00.068 --> 20:02.070
She's paying me
$1,000 a week.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.854
Ooh, Beans likes that.[laughs]

20:03.941 --> 20:06.466
[phone rings]

20:07.858 --> 20:11.601
Oh, guess who.

20:11.688 --> 20:14.691
Hi, J.C.

20:14.778 --> 20:18.695
Well, I'm... sorry
that you're hungry.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.958
No, you have food
in your house.

20:21.045 --> 20:26.137
I made you a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich today.

20:26.225 --> 20:30.054
Okay, first, get
the bread out.

20:30.141 --> 20:33.057
You put peanut
butter on one side,

20:33.144 --> 20:36.452
and you put jelly
on the other.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.237
Yes, you cando this.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.803
For 1,000 bucks a week,
you go over there

20:39.890 --> 20:41.196
and make that nice lady
a sandwich.
