WEBVTT

00:05.830 --> 00:07.491
WOMAN:
First time?

00:07.540 --> 00:09.167
Excuse me?

00:09.210 --> 00:12.077
Um, is it your first time
voting?

00:12.110 --> 00:13.077
Uh, yes.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.236
Your name?

00:14.280 --> 00:15.633
Zach Florrick.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.171
(laughs)
Why, you have the same last name

00:18.210 --> 00:19.472
as one of the candidates.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.476
Really?
I know what it's like.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.215
My last name is Eisenhower.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.218
Uh, do you need
any help?

00:25.250 --> 00:27.013
I think I should be fine.
Thank you.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.521
(door opens, closes)

01:01.820 --> 01:04.425
*

01:20.210 --> 01:22.178
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.178
Uh, did you see that ballot
box over there in the corner?

01:24.210 --> 01:26.314
Uh, no, you put
your ballot in here.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.419
Yes, I know. I just...

01:27.450 --> 01:29.714
There's a ballot box over there
with a broken seal.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.149
Ballot boxes are
supposed to be sealed,
Uh...

01:31.190 --> 01:32.316
and the seal's ripped.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.384
Are you sure?
Yes.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.120
What's up, Nana?
Uh, this young man

01:40.160 --> 01:43.163
thinks there's a problem
with a ballot box.
(shutter clicks)

01:43.200 --> 01:45.168
Excuse me. _
What are you domg?

01:45.200 --> 01:46.599
Taking a picture.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.732
Well, you can't do that.

01:47.770 --> 01:50.159
Take a picture?
Of course I can.
No,

01:50.210 --> 01:52.906
no, it's actually illegal.
It's only illegal if
you're taking a photo

01:52.940 --> 01:54.703
of someone who's voting.
There's no one voting.
Excuse me.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.605
I am the polling monitor here,

01:56.650 --> 01:58.641
and I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.342
We're still confident,
Your Honor.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.641
The polls have us neck and neck.

02:04.690 --> 02:07.409
It's just gonna all come down
to our get-out-the-vote...
Eli,

02:07.460 --> 02:10.588
I want Cristian to be
on the stage with us.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.598
He's family.
Yeah, whatever.

02:12.630 --> 02:14.450
Alicia, hold on. I'm having
trouble hearing you.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.320
Eli, what did my mother
just say to you?

02:16.370 --> 02:18.361
Oh, she wants her
helper on the dais.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.231
Peter, we may be having
trouble with early voting.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.306
I don't want Cristian
on the dais.
What?

02:22.340 --> 02:24.706
Peter, is this
really important?

02:24.740 --> 02:27.277
God.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.231
(overlapping chatter)

02:28.280 --> 02:30.271
ELI:
Everybody out.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.210
Come on! Out, out, out. Out!

02:32.250 --> 02:34.445
Go downstairs. Come on! Nora,
get these people out of here.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.617
Put that down.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.481
(sighs)
So what did Zach see?

02:37.520 --> 02:39.659
Zach was early voting
in the 43rd Ward,

02:39.690 --> 02:41.817
and he may have seen
a stuffed ballot box

02:41.860 --> 02:44.328
of Kresteva votes.
Why does he think
it was stuffed?

02:44.360 --> 02:46.920
Because the ballot box
had a ripped seal.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.928
He thinks it was a ripped seal

02:48.960 --> 02:50.461
_ or he_ knows
It was a ripped seal?

02:50.500 --> 02:51.467
He took a picture.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.263
Alicia,
I'm looking at it now.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.939
tomorrow's Election Day.
All our lawyers are downstate.

02:55.970 --> 02:57.005
Can you ask Diane
to take this?

02:57.040 --> 02:59.338
I think she's at dinner.
You want me to call Will?

02:59.380 --> 03:02.406
No. Diane is incentivized.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.599
Right,
If Peter doesn't win...

03:03.650 --> 03:05.902
she doesn't get the judgeship.
Okay, I'll call you back.

03:05.950 --> 03:07.577
Okay.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.588
(quietly):
Kresteva is trying
to steal this election,

03:09.620 --> 03:11.247
and we have to stop him.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.609
Okay.

03:12.660 --> 03:16.323
Where are you worried about
the most Kresteva votes?

03:16.360 --> 03:20.353
Addison Township.
4lst Ward.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.924
Uh, what are you doing?

03:21.960 --> 03:24.428
I'm gonna take care of it.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.461
You want to know how?

03:27.300 --> 03:29.268
No. I don't know. Do I?

03:29.310 --> 03:31.266
_ It's ten hours
till the polls open.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.278
I have a septic truck ready.

03:33.310 --> 03:36.404
I'm gonna park it in front
of the main precinct in the 4lst

03:36.450 --> 03:38.702
and... accidentally spill it.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.741
Okay?

03:47.990 --> 03:50.959
CARY:
This is perfect. Wow.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.526
My office here.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.697
(chuckling)

03:53.730 --> 03:55.391
Conference room there.
I love It.

03:55.430 --> 03:56.465
How much is it?

03:56.500 --> 03:58.718
$60 a square foot.

03:58.770 --> 04:00.328
Ouch.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.258
We're not gonna find much
cheaper in the Loop.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.335
Not_if we want to
move In In two weeks.

04:04.370 --> 04:07.476
Well, we can't afford
$60 a square foot.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.842
We can if we reduce
our upfront salary costs.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.314
Okay, and how
do we do that?
Kalinda.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.978
We all agreed.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.409
We pay her ask. That's the only
way she'll come with us.

04:17.450 --> 04:18.747
(phone chimes)
We changed our minds.

04:18.790 --> 04:21.418
(sighs
Look, gu)ys.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.428
Kalinda wins cases.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.052
We split off
from Lockhart/Gardner,

04:25.090 --> 04:26.557
we need to win.
That's how we grow.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.420
Maybe there's someone else
who can win cases cheaper.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.722
And maybe there's
someone who can win cases

04:29.770 --> 04:32.762
and pay us, but that's unlikely.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.337
That's Diane.

04:35.370 --> 04:36.837
I have to go.

04:36.870 --> 04:39.373
Ask Kalinda if she'll take
a commitment to bump up

04:39.410 --> 04:40.434
in the second year.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.401
I'll see you guys down
in the bar in an hour.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.748
(sighs)

04:47.780 --> 04:50.783
Judy, stop it right now

04:50.820 --> 04:52.788
or we'll all be yawning
in a minute.

04:52.820 --> 04:54.458
I'm Judge Abernathy.

04:54.490 --> 04:58.449
I'm the magistrate on call
for electioneering disputes.

04:58.490 --> 04:59.593
Well, what is the
issue, Counselor?

04:59.630 --> 05:02.360
We have some question
about the provenance of ballots

05:02.400 --> 05:04.095
we discovered in early voting.

05:04.130 --> 05:07.463
And we ask for emergency relief
before voting is concluded

05:07.500 --> 05:09.934
in approximately
21 hours.
And you, Sir,

05:09.970 --> 05:11.904
you are here to
represent the interests

05:11.940 --> 05:14.374
of the Kresteva campaign?
No, I am, Your Honor.

05:14.410 --> 05:16.037
Apologies for my lateness.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.605
The campaign just
asked me to step in.

05:18.650 --> 05:20.470
And who better to argue
at an all-night session

05:20.520 --> 05:22.613
than a mother who would
be up anyway? (chuckles)

05:22.650 --> 05:25.016
You can go now.
Welcome, ma'am.
And I see that

05:25.050 --> 05:28.383
you have some... uh,
accoutrements with you.

05:28.420 --> 05:29.785
Yes, my babies, Your Honor.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.526
I'm sorry, but I have
to breastfeed the little one

05:32.560 --> 05:34.619
or she won't sleep
through the night.
Okay. Just...

05:34.660 --> 05:36.560
try to keep them quiet, okay?

05:36.600 --> 05:38.420
Yes.

05:38.470 --> 05:39.892
Thank you, Your Honor.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.633
Could you please tell us
what you saw tonight

05:48.680 --> 05:50.978
at the 5th Precinct
in the 43rd Ward.
Yes.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.012
I saw an u_nsealed_ box of votes
beIng carrIed In

05:53.050 --> 05:54.176
and placed in the corner.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.518
And did you happen to take
a picture of those ballots?

05:56.550 --> 05:57.539
Yeah, with my cell phone.
(baby crying)

05:57.590 --> 05:59.558
Sorry, Your Honor.

05:59.590 --> 06:01.649
No. That's quite all right.
We'll just wait.

06:01.690 --> 06:03.487
So, Zach,
this photo

06:03.530 --> 06:05.589
that you took,
is that the ballot box

06:05.630 --> 06:06.654
sealnpped?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.656
It is.
I tender the witness.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.099
(whispers):
Just be honest.

06:15.770 --> 06:17.909
So...

06:17.940 --> 06:19.578
Zach Florrick,

06:19.610 --> 06:21.532
what did your mother

06:21.580 --> 06:23.468
whisper to you just now?

06:23.510 --> 06:24.647
She whispered, "Just be honest."
I see.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.477
So she was afraid
you wouldn't be?

06:26.520 --> 06:27.942
Objection, Your
Honor, I gave

06:27.980 --> 06:30.540
my son the same advice I would
give any first-time witness.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.818
Withdrawn.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.454
Now, Zach,

06:33.490 --> 06:34.616
have you ever
been arrested?

06:34.660 --> 06:36.787
Objection. Relevance.
Goes to character.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.979
My son was
pulled over once,

06:38.030 --> 06:39.588
but the prosecutor
dropped the charges.

06:39.630 --> 06:42.190
Excuse me, Your Honor.
I'm questioning a witness,

06:42.230 --> 06:44.460
not his mother.
Yes, Mrs. Florrick,

06:44.500 --> 06:46.468
please.
Why were you arrested, Zach?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.832
For recording a police officer.
Taking his picture.

06:48.870 --> 06:52.931
So... this would be
the second time in eight months

06:52.980 --> 06:54.868
you've seen something
you thought corrupt

06:54.910 --> 06:56.468
and took a picture?
Sure.

06:56.510 --> 06:59.149
Seems to happen a lot to you?

06:59.180 --> 07:00.545
Well, it's happened twice.
I don't know

07:00.580 --> 07:02.480
if I'd call that "a lot."
This last time

07:02.520 --> 07:03.942
you were pulled over
for drug possession.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.218
A charge that was dropped.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.046
Mrs. Florrick.
I was

07:06.090 --> 07:07.648
pulled over,
but I wasn't

07:07.690 --> 07:09.726
carrying drugs.
The policeman seemed
to disagree.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.489
The policeman was wrong.

07:11.530 --> 07:12.758
Do you question authority a lot?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.756
No. Only when it's wrong.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.158
MAN:
Yes, I saw him
taking pictures,

07:26.210 --> 07:27.973
and I told him to stop.

07:28.010 --> 07:29.602
And he said he wouldn't,

07:29.650 --> 07:30.844
so I threatened
to call the police.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.939
PA'I'I'I:
And this photo he took,
you're saying

07:32.980 --> 07:35.778
those were not
unsecured ballots?

07:35.820 --> 07:37.742
That's correct--
they were ballots from
earlier in the week.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.587
But he said he saw a man
bring them in.
Well,

07:39.620 --> 07:40.985
that was one of the, uh...
the poll workers.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.726
I asked him to
move them.
PATTI: I see.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.218
I think young Mr. Florrick may
have a tendency to exaggerate.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.796
DIANE/ALICIA:
Objection!
My goodness.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.264
Ms. Lockhart, good
evening. You've decided

07:50.300 --> 07:51.858
to join our little
slumber party?

07:51.900 --> 07:52.935
I have, Your Honor.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.130
You couldn't keep me away.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.637
Sorry.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.968
My sciatica is acting up.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.830
I have to walk every 20 minutes

07:59.880 --> 08:01.700
or my doctor yells at me.
PA'I'I'I:
Would you

08:01.740 --> 08:03.002
like me to take a pause?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.677
No, no, no. Keep going.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.610
I can hear. _
Just one more questIon,

08:06.650 --> 08:08.618
Mr. Buckley. Um...

08:08.650 --> 08:11.847
why was this ballot box
unsealed at all?

08:11.890 --> 08:13.710
Well, I tried to lift it,
and I accidentally...

08:13.760 --> 08:14.715
I-I ripped the seal.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.886
PA'I'I'I:
Oh. Nothing further.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.887
DIANE:
Mr. Buckley,

08:16.930 --> 08:19.558
you are a registered Republican,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.192
isn't that_correct?
It Is.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.664
Though I'm not sure
what that has to do with this.

08:23.700 --> 08:24.997
You want Mr. Kresteva to win.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.998
Objection, Your
Honor. Uh...

08:27.040 --> 08:30.259
Uh, Mr. Buckley's candidate
preference is not an issue.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.607
I would agree. Sustained.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.107
Your Honor, by all accounts,

08:33.140 --> 08:35.074
this will be _
a very close electIon.

08:35.110 --> 08:37.977
Some polls suggest 1,000
votes will determine

08:38.010 --> 08:40.877
whether Peter Florrick or
Mike Kresteva is governor.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.218
And so we ask
that this box be

08:43.250 --> 08:44.182
impounded by the court...
Your Honor,

08:44.220 --> 08:46.586
this is not a police state.
until such time

08:46.620 --> 08:48.588
as their provenance
can be determined.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.588
And if the vote
count suggests,

08:50.630 --> 08:53.292
a one-sided count in favor
of Mr. Kresteva,

08:53.330 --> 08:54.729
we would argue

08:54.760 --> 08:55.852
that fraud charges be brought.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.094
Your Honor,
this is

08:57.130 --> 08:58.620
a blatant attempt...
Your Honor,

08:58.670 --> 09:02.060
we have less than 24 hours
before the polls close.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.658
(banging gavel)

09:03.710 --> 09:05.007
Okay. Time out.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.337
Five-minute recess.

09:06.370 --> 09:08.099
* My tambourine
is still shaking... *

09:08.140 --> 09:11.109
We need you to look into
the provenance of these ballots.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.573
Quickly. Now. Cary,
look into the background
Okay.

09:13.620 --> 09:14.644
of this Republican monitor.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.817
Any connection to Kresteva.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.010
Got it. Kalinda.

09:17.050 --> 09:20.850
Kalinda, we need to talk.

09:20.890 --> 09:23.620
(sighs)
We can't pay your ask.

09:23.660 --> 09:25.685
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.857
Just listen to me.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.721
You have the chance to get in on
the ground floor of something.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.169
Cary, please, don't sell me.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.328
Within a year, we will prom...

09:35.370 --> 09:39.932
WILL:
Good evening.
Hi.
Will.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.778
Within a year, we'll promise
you ten percent more

09:42.810 --> 09:44.072
than Lockhart/Gardner.

09:44.110 --> 09:46.203
* All dressed in rag
and bones... *

09:46.250 --> 09:48.810
You give me five percent
of all profits

09:48.850 --> 09:50.147
for the first three years.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.909
You want me to get excited
about the ground floor idea,

09:52.960 --> 09:56.828
five percent,
no overhead, clean.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.751
Hi, Patti. It's odd
you're in on this.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.689
The pharmaceutical industry
likes Kresteva over your boy.

10:03.730 --> 10:05.664
Is this a new one?

10:05.700 --> 10:08.191
I don't know.
I've lost track.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.367
You can call me Nana Joe.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.002
I love your beret.
I took it off

10:12.040 --> 10:13.075
out of respect.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.702
No, put it on.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.832
(chuckles)

10:15.880 --> 10:17.404
Thank you, Nana Joe.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.406
That is a lovely beret.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.645
Mr. Buckley said

10:21.680 --> 10:24.240
that he acci...

10:24.290 --> 10:27.680
ABERNATHY:
Uh, just keep gomg.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.689
Mr. Buckley
said he accidentally...

10:30.730 --> 10:32.322
ripped the box's seal

10:32.360 --> 10:35.249
when he tried to move it.
Is that correct?
I was there all day

10:35.300 --> 10:37.222
and I didn't see him
move from his office.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.296
But you did see someone enter
your polling place with the box?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.296
I remember because I thought
he was a voter.

10:42.340 --> 10:46.003
And then I saw this big box
in his arms.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.439
Thank you, Nana.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.074
(quietly):
Good luck crossing
Grandma Moses.

10:50.110 --> 10:53.079
Hi, Nana Joe.
(chuckles)

10:53.120 --> 10:56.009
When was the last time
you had your eyes checked?

10:56.050 --> 10:57.984
NANA JOE:
Oh, I don't know.

10:58.020 --> 10:59.282
A few months ago.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.380
And can you see
all the way back to that door

11:02.420 --> 11:04.854
back there?
Yeah, I guess.

11:04.890 --> 11:08.257
So, if I walk back here...

11:08.300 --> 11:10.723
Your Honor, object...

11:10.770 --> 11:11.725
Objection.

11:11.770 --> 11:12.737
This kind of stunt

11:12.770 --> 11:13.862
went out with Perry Mason.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.164
And yet, I enjoy it every time.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.701
PA'I'I'I:
Thank you, Your Honor.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.707
Nana Joe,

11:18.740 --> 11:21.277
how many fingers
am I holding up?

11:21.310 --> 11:22.902
Uh, it looks like,

11:22.950 --> 11:24.406
uh, three.
Mm.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.749
Actually, it's two.

11:27.780 --> 11:29.008
Thank you, Nana Joe.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.881
And thank you
for your service to the city.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.046
DIANE:
Nana Joe,

11:32.090 --> 11:34.718
when this man entered
the pol|Ing place,

11:34.760 --> 11:35.784
was he as far away

11:35.820 --> 11:37.788
as that door?

11:37.830 --> 11:38.649
Well, just at first, but

11:38.690 --> 11:40.191
then he came right past me.
Past you?

11:40.230 --> 11:41.788
Closer than I am?

11:41.830 --> 11:42.728
A little closer.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.294
This close?

11:44.330 --> 11:45.467
Little closer.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.728
This close.

11:46.770 --> 11:47.964
And how many fingers
am I holding up?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.230
(laughs)
Two.
Thank you, Nana.

11:50.270 --> 11:51.931
ABERNATHY:
Uh, I have good
news for everyone.

11:51.970 --> 11:55.906
We have located
the ballot box in question.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.100
455-721.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.799
DIANE:
Your Honor, we ask that these

11:58.850 --> 12:01.318
ballots be immediately counted

12:01.350 --> 12:03.215
to determine whether a fraud...
The sanctity

12:03.250 --> 12:05.218
of the voting booth must not
be breached, Your Honor.
We're not

12:05.250 --> 12:07.013
breaching it, we're determining
how many votes...

12:07.060 --> 12:08.288
I am not going to allow
another Gore v. Bush.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.878
(clamoring)

12:09.930 --> 12:11.784
Well, I have

12:11.830 --> 12:13.752
some good news:
the votes have

12:13.800 --> 12:14.755
been counted.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.064
There are 30,843 total.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.068
That is
a considerable chunk

12:19.100 --> 12:20.431
for such a small
pol|Ing place.

12:20.470 --> 12:21.994
How many votes
are for Kresteva?

12:22.040 --> 12:24.201
Uh, 2,685.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.073
26,000?
No, 2,600.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.047
ABERNATHY:
Yes.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.308
That's a surprise.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.011
The rest are for Florrick.

12:33.050 --> 12:36.941
28,158.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.857
We... Your Honor, um...

12:39.890 --> 12:42.211
Would you like
to change your motion?

12:42.260 --> 12:45.354
Yes, we-- actually, we are
going to withdraw the motion

12:45.390 --> 12:47.392
out of respect for
the voting process.

12:47.430 --> 12:49.398
PA'I'I'I:
We'd like to make a
motion, Your Honor.

12:49.430 --> 12:50.795
Of course you would.

12:50.830 --> 12:51.922
These ballots are fraudulent

12:51.970 --> 12:52.937
and should be thrown out.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.961
* Black tambourine.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.441
That's five percent, Cary.
Right, but if we make nothing,

13:07.480 --> 13:09.072
Kalinda makes nothing.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.212
I've been watching
Lockhart/Gardner

13:10.250 --> 13:13.185
make all the same mistakes:

13:13.220 --> 13:14.812
overpromising.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.953
We said we shouldn't
overextend ourselves...
We aren't!

13:16.990 --> 13:19.379
Their mistake was committing
money they didn't have.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.523
Maybe you're a little
too close to this, Cary.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.118
What does that mean?

13:23.170 --> 13:25.320
You have no objectivity
about Kalinda.

13:25.370 --> 13:28.533
I have just as much
objectivity as anyone.

13:28.570 --> 13:30.561
No. We haven't
slept with her.

13:32.540 --> 13:33.973
Okay.

13:34.010 --> 13:36.433
Uh, I think this is
going off the rails a bit.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.301
Is that Colin Sweeney?

13:40.620 --> 13:43.180
Mr. Agos.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.548
I wanted to toast

13:47.590 --> 13:49.387
your new venture.

13:49.420 --> 13:50.557
My new...

13:50.590 --> 13:52.990
Yes, your little rebellion.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.520
It's in the air.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.221
Like Les Misrables.

13:56.260 --> 13:57.466
Did you see that musical?

13:57.500 --> 14:00.992
Vive la resistance, eh?

14:02.470 --> 14:04.563
I'm not... I'm not sure...
I own the building.

14:04.610 --> 14:08.171
My manager told me you were
considering a lease.

14:08.210 --> 14:11.099
What are you looking for,
Mr. Sweeney?

14:11.150 --> 14:15.041
I want a discount
on my legal serVIces.

14:15.080 --> 14:19.289
You can have 20% savings
on my office space,

14:19.320 --> 14:23.484
and I get two years of free,
unlimited legal work.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.157
Work it out.

14:25.190 --> 14:26.623
It's a good deal.

14:26.660 --> 14:29.299
Alicia's not coming with us.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.567
The voters have spoken.
Exactly.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.635
That is the point, Your Honor.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.137
No, where did these
votes come from?

14:35.170 --> 14:36.137
Out of the blue?

14:36.170 --> 14:38.536
Ms. Nyholm has just spent
the last two hours

14:38.570 --> 14:40.231
arguing the opposite.
As has everyone.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.009
PATTI: If the preponderance of
the votes were for Kresteva,

14:42.040 --> 14:42.802
it would be fraud.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.000
Well, the preponderance
of the votes

14:44.050 --> 14:44.800
are for Florrick...

14:44.850 --> 14:46.340
WILL:
Your Honor, I know Ms. Nyholm

14:46.380 --> 14:47.574
thinks she can shout her way

14:47.620 --> 14:48.609
to a positive result...

14:48.650 --> 14:49.617
PA'I'I'I:
No, I'm not shouting,

14:49.650 --> 14:50.514
I'm making my
point clearly...

14:50.550 --> 14:51.517
(clamoring)

14:51.550 --> 14:53.916
There were 30,843 ballots.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.350
28,158 were for you, Peter.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.483
Do you think they'll
be thrown out?
I don't know.

14:59.530 --> 15:02.055
Diane and Will
are arguing to keep them.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.260
Will is arguing?

15:03.300 --> 15:05.029
Yes.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.662
They're doing their best,

15:06.700 --> 15:09.066
but we just spent two hours
arguing the opposite.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.260
ELI:
We need those votes.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.436
All of them.
We think it's that close.

15:11.470 --> 15:12.437
I know.

15:12.470 --> 15:13.471
We're trying.

15:13.510 --> 15:14.636
Okay, hon, I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.079
Okay, see you later.

15:16.110 --> 15:17.179
(laughter)

15:17.210 --> 15:18.609
You. You.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.311
You think she knows I'm losing?

15:20.350 --> 15:22.648
I've dedicate my life to not
predicting what Jackie knows.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.715
Jim.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.218
Is there any way we can
make up those 30,000 votes?

15:26.250 --> 15:28.582
Yeah. Maybe in the 18th Ward.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.281
What kind of walk-around
money you got?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.457
I'll go find out.

15:32.490 --> 15:35.357
Jim, I want you
to do me a favor.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.597
My mother's nurse,
Cristian Romero--

15:38.630 --> 15:40.530
I want you to check him out.
MOODY: Sure.

15:40.570 --> 15:42.197
Financial, criminal,
personal?

15:42.240 --> 15:43.366
Everything.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.366
_ I want to know
If he's usmg my mom.

15:45.410 --> 15:48.038
But you swear
that these ballots

15:48.080 --> 15:49.433
are the result
of early votIng

15:49.480 --> 15:50.674
over the last week?
Yes.

15:50.710 --> 15:51.972
And, sir, you are Republican?

15:52.010 --> 15:53.568
Yes, I am still a Republican.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.644
And therefore,

15:54.680 --> 15:56.545
it is not in your interest

15:56.580 --> 15:58.719
to have these votes
benefit a Democrat?

15:58.750 --> 16:00.411
Mr. Buckley,

16:00.460 --> 16:02.519
is it true that you

16:02.560 --> 16:04.687
wrote an essay
for The American Spectator

16:04.730 --> 16:06.288
criticizing Mitt Romney?

16:07.760 --> 16:10.194
So, your eyesight
is perfectly fine, Nana,

16:10.230 --> 16:12.596
and you saw a suspicious man

16:12.630 --> 16:14.131
carrying in these ballots?
DIANE:
Objection.

16:14.170 --> 16:15.432
She didn't say "suspicious."

16:15.470 --> 16:17.301
Was the man suspicious, Nana?
Yes, a bit.

16:17.340 --> 16:19.706
You saw
a SUSplCIOUS man

16:19.740 --> 16:21.537
carrying in ballots?

16:21.580 --> 16:23.707
And you have no reason
to lie here today.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.348
Nana Joe...

16:28.380 --> 16:31.781
do you take
the prescription medicine

16:31.820 --> 16:33.754
memantine?
Yes.

16:33.790 --> 16:34.757
And why do you take

16:34.790 --> 16:36.257
this medicine?
My doctor

16:36.290 --> 16:37.757
told me to.
But it's

16:37.790 --> 16:39.781
an Alzheimer's medicine,
isn't that correct?

16:39.830 --> 16:41.229
I'm not showing the symptoms.

16:41.260 --> 16:42.591
So, then, why do you take it?
I told you,

16:42.630 --> 16:45.098
my doctor said.
Nana, when's
your husband's birthday?

16:45.130 --> 16:47.337
Uh... you don't
know, do you?

16:47.370 --> 16:48.689
I'm checking my datebook.

16:48.740 --> 16:51.265
Yes, but off the top
of your head, you don't know.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.778
Isn't it possible,
ma'am, that you forgot

16:53.810 --> 16:56.472
that Mr. Buckley told you
he wanted the ballots moved...

16:56.510 --> 16:57.738
I don't forget things.

16:57.780 --> 16:59.077
Things like
your husband's birthday?

16:59.110 --> 17:02.477
_ (crying):
I just want to go home.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.181
Can I go home?

17:04.220 --> 17:05.380
Can you remember your address?

17:05.420 --> 17:07.081
Objection, Your Honor.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.485
He's badgering...
It's a fair question,
Your Honor.

17:11.690 --> 17:14.659
So, Zach, you were just
being a good citizen

17:14.700 --> 17:17.624
when you took pictures
of the cop who pulled you over?

17:17.670 --> 17:18.659
I guess.
And this

17:18.700 --> 17:20.338
cop was later fired

17:20.370 --> 17:21.337
for his activities?

17:21.370 --> 17:22.735
I didn't know that.
He was.

17:22.770 --> 17:25.136
_You were instrumental
In gettIng a crooked cop

17:25.170 --> 17:26.432
off the streets.

17:26.470 --> 17:28.438
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Don't be humble.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.833
Your mom must be
very proud of you.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.348
And you definitely

17:32.380 --> 17:36.544
saw these ballots being
carried in off the street

17:36.580 --> 17:39.708
and not moved from one place
to another in the polling place?

17:39.750 --> 17:41.786
Well...
You do know

17:41.820 --> 17:43.219
the penalty for perjury?

17:43.260 --> 17:44.227
Objection.
ABERNATHY:
Uh, yes.

17:44.260 --> 17:45.158
Uh, can we all
just assume

17:45.190 --> 17:46.657
that witnesses know
they shouldn't lIe?

17:46.690 --> 17:48.794
Yes, thank you,
Your Honor.

17:48.830 --> 17:50.798
Just a simple question, Zach.

17:50.830 --> 17:54.368
Do you believe
these unsealed ballots

17:54.400 --> 17:58.063
came in off the street?

17:59.770 --> 18:01.579
Yes.
Thank you,

18:01.610 --> 18:02.634
Zach, for being honest.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.808
I know there must be
a lot of pressure on you not to.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.787
_ ABERNATHY:
AnythIng from the defense?

18:11.820 --> 18:13.458
I'll do it.
Nqum

18:15.760 --> 18:18.524
Zach, how long were you in the
5th Precinct polling place?

18:18.560 --> 18:19.458
About ten minutes.

18:19.490 --> 18:20.525
And did you see what
happened in the precinct

18:20.560 --> 18:24.189
in the time before you
arrived or the time after?

18:24.230 --> 18:25.197
No.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.663
So you had no way of knowing

18:26.700 --> 18:29.134
where these men
carryIng the ballot box

18:29.170 --> 18:31.764
came from originally?

18:31.810 --> 18:33.471
Yes. That's true.

18:33.510 --> 18:35.330
And you had
no way of knowing

18:35.380 --> 18:36.802
whether these men
recered orders

18:36.840 --> 18:39.707
from Mr. Buckley or not?

18:39.750 --> 18:41.217
That's right.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.547
So it's not lying

18:42.580 --> 18:44.787
to acknowledge the limits
of your own testimony?

18:44.820 --> 18:46.447
That's right.
And so do you know

18:46.490 --> 18:48.287
if these ballots were
fraudulent or not,

18:48.320 --> 18:51.687
or if the seal on the
ballot box was ripped

18:51.730 --> 18:54.893
accidentally or never attached?

18:54.930 --> 18:56.557
I have no way of knowing.
Good.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.624
Thank you, Zach.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.764
ABERNATHY:
And so, if there's
nothing further, I...

19:01.840 --> 19:02.829
(whispering)

19:02.870 --> 19:04.861
ABERNATHY:
Okay.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.401
Uh, we need to put a pause
in these proceedings.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.772
It appears that there is now
a matter being adjudicated

19:09.810 --> 19:13.246
in the federal court which will
make this matter moot.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.713
In the federal court?
What is it?

19:14.750 --> 19:15.842
An injunction on the
ballot as a whole.

19:15.880 --> 19:16.778
From which campaign?

19:16.820 --> 19:17.912
Uh, the third party.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.657
*

19:25.960 --> 19:26.779
Go to the suite.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.889
I'll meet you
after we deal with this.

19:28.930 --> 19:30.261
We'll come with you.
No.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.291
Zach, I don't know
how long this will go,

19:32.330 --> 19:33.729
and I don't have time to argue.

19:33.770 --> 19:35.692
I'm gonna call Dad
and tell him you're coming.

19:35.740 --> 19:36.934
Will, wait up.

19:36.970 --> 19:39.404
Wait, Mom, come with us.
We'll take you.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.271
(phone ringing)
No, I'm fine. Go, Grace.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.902
* Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh...

19:42.940 --> 19:44.908
ALICIA:
Hello?

19:44.950 --> 19:46.872
SWEENEY:
Alicia, how are you?

19:46.910 --> 19:47.877
Who is this?

19:47.920 --> 19:48.944
I'm hurt.

19:48.980 --> 19:49.969
You really don't know?

19:50.020 --> 19:51.248
Mr. Sweeney?

19:51.290 --> 19:53.281
It's 1:00 am.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.856
Colin Sweeney?
What does he want?

19:54.890 --> 19:56.983
Uh, look, Mr. Sweeney,
I'm a little busy.

19:57.020 --> 19:58.829
Yes, campaign night.

19:58.860 --> 19:59.929
Congratulations.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.292
I voted for your husband.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.319
Can-can we talk tomorrow?

20:03.370 --> 20:04.325
No.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.691
I think you should join Mr. Agos

20:06.730 --> 20:07.833
in his new firm.

20:07.870 --> 20:08.894
What does he want?

20:08.940 --> 20:10.828
Uh, nothing. A case.

20:10.870 --> 20:14.601
Oh, are we keeping things
from our betters?

20:14.640 --> 20:17.347
I'm thinking of moving
my business with Mr. Agos.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.574
That's $22 million a year.

20:18.610 --> 20:19.941
You don't want to lose
out on that, do you?

20:19.980 --> 20:20.947
Mr. Sweeney,

20:20.980 --> 20:22.379
this is not neither the time...

20:22.420 --> 20:23.978
Yes, I know
you're a partner now, Alicia,

20:24.020 --> 20:25.385
but it's a smart move.

20:25.420 --> 20:26.819
Go with the up and coming.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.817
(phone beeps)

20:27.860 --> 20:29.953
That was abrupt.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.821
Yeah, he was going on.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.895
Okay, let's start again.

20:37.930 --> 20:39.818
If you don't mind.

20:39.870 --> 20:42.930
Come on in. We just started.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.700
Please continue, sir.

20:45.740 --> 20:46.707
Thank you, Your Honor.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.605
I'm campaign manager for
third-party candidate

20:48.640 --> 20:51.473
Albert O'Dell,
and I have evidence

20:51.510 --> 20:53.239
that this election's a fraud.

21:03.860 --> 21:05.555
The problem is the ballot
used in early voting.

21:05.590 --> 21:07.956
My candidate's name
is Albert O'Dell.

21:08.000 --> 21:08.898
And the ballot left out

21:08.930 --> 21:11.296
the apostrophe, as you
can see right there.

21:11.330 --> 21:12.695
I'll argue this one,

21:12.730 --> 21:13.890
you argue the next?
Agreed.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.293
Your Honor,

21:15.340 --> 21:17.308
the third-party candidate
has been polling

21:17.340 --> 21:19.399
at 3.2 percent.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.930
Mr....
Karahalios.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.073
Eh... the third-party
campaign manager

21:23.110 --> 21:25.874
is suggesting the
disenfranchising

21:25.910 --> 21:27.878
of 800,000 early votes

21:27.920 --> 21:30.343
_all_ because of
a mIssmg apostrophe?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.687
That is ridiculous.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.711
BOTH (whisper):
In your opinion.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.857
Is that in your opinion?

21:35.890 --> 21:38.620
Oh. Um, uh, yes.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.651
Uh, in my opinion.
Of course.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.021
Yes, Mr. Karahalios,
I'm not sure

21:43.060 --> 21:46.791
a typo rises to the level
of a civil rights matter.

21:46.830 --> 21:50.038
My candidate is counting on
the Irish vote, Your Honor.

21:50.070 --> 21:50.604
You lose the apostrophe,

21:50.640 --> 21:51.959
and the Irish "O'Dell"

21:52.010 --> 21:53.773
suddenly becomes
the English "Odell."

21:53.810 --> 21:55.732
Illinois is 15% Irish.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.998
In my opinion, this
typo's the difference

21:58.050 --> 21:59.506
between winning or losing.

21:59.550 --> 22:00.812
I hate to break
it to you, buddy,

22:00.850 --> 22:01.316
but you're the third party.

22:01.350 --> 22:02.009
You're gonna lose.

22:02.050 --> 22:04.541
And, yes, that's
my opinion.

22:05.990 --> 22:07.719
Okay, we got an
apostrophe problem.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.886
I'm awake.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.649
We need arguments
why the judge should allow

22:10.690 --> 22:12.658
this third party's misprint
in the early voting ballots.

22:12.690 --> 22:14.521
Anything you can find,
anyone you can wake up.

22:17.630 --> 22:20.895
Cary? Do you want me to tell
the partners you're leaving?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.430
Excuse me?

22:22.470 --> 22:24.438
Stop stealing my clients,

22:24.470 --> 22:26.609
or so help me, Cary,
I'll tell them.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.608
Alicia, I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.107
I got a call
from Colin Sweeney.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.846
Yes, that's right.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.848
Sweeney, my client.
No.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.472
Alicia, he approached me.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.646
He did not approach you.

22:36.680 --> 22:37.840
We were looking
for real estate.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.518
He said he'd give us a 20%
discount for free legal work.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.913
I'd never approach
him, Alicia.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.951
I'd never steal one of
your c|Ients. Never.

22:43.990 --> 22:45.958
Hi. Sorry.

22:45.990 --> 22:46.957
Robyn, we're talking.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.652
Yeah, um, but I have something
on the misprint.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.894
What?

22:50.930 --> 22:53.728
A friend of mine-- she works
for the third-party campaign.

22:53.770 --> 22:55.988
And she says
Albert O'Dell is Jewish.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.905
O'Dell is not
hIs real name.

22:57.940 --> 22:59.635
Good. We can run with that.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.001
Thanks, Robyn.

23:01.040 --> 23:01.904
You're welcome.

23:01.940 --> 23:03.100
Robyn?

23:05.180 --> 23:08.946
How are you liking it
at Lockhart/Gardner?

23:08.980 --> 23:10.789
Your Honor, before you decide
on this matter,

23:10.820 --> 23:11.787
we have new information.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.459
What is that?
If I may address
Mr. Karahalios.

23:16.860 --> 23:18.828
What is your candidate's
full name?

23:18.860 --> 23:20.794
Albert Seamus O'Dell, with

23:20.830 --> 23:21.899
the apostrophe.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.693
And who is Albert Steinman?

23:23.730 --> 23:26.164
I don't know.
Who are you referring to?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.589
Mr. O'Dell's real name
before he changed it.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.609
Certainly within his legal
rights to change his name.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.108
But he has no actual
Irish roots, correct?

23:34.140 --> 23:35.698
Just because you have a name
that doesn't sound Irish

23:35.740 --> 23:36.809
doesn't mean
that you're not Irish.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.139
A name like Odell, for example,
without an apostrophe?

23:40.180 --> 23:42.011
Your Honor,

23:42.050 --> 23:45.588
there has been no real damage
here because Mr. Steinman--

23:45.620 --> 23:47.679
or as he is now called,
Mr. O'Dell--

23:47.720 --> 23:50.553
has no Irish heritage
to be damaged, in my opinion.

23:50.590 --> 23:53.627
Yes. I overrule the motion
for emergency reIIef.

23:56.030 --> 23:57.588
How's Jackie doing?

23:57.630 --> 24:00.019
Good. She wants
to go on a crUIse.

24:00.070 --> 24:01.230
Really?

24:01.270 --> 24:03.033
Yes. She sees_ the
TV commerCIals.

24:03.070 --> 24:05.004
Mm-hmm. And you'll go
on a cruise with her?

24:05.040 --> 24:07.235
No. I've had enough
water for a lifetime.

24:07.270 --> 24:09.909
Right, right.
Coming over from Cuba.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.874
No. Working as
a lifeguard.

24:11.910 --> 24:16.142
Oh. So, um, Peter wanted me
to talk to you, Cristian.

24:16.180 --> 24:18.080
After the election,

24:18.120 --> 24:20.042
they won't need your services
much anymore.

24:20.090 --> 24:21.819
I see.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.021
Well, if Jackie's fine
with that, I am fine.

24:24.060 --> 24:27.496
This is coming from Peter.

24:27.530 --> 24:29.623
I'll have to speak to Jackie.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.939
I've seen your arrest record,
Cristian.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.767
Really?

24:35.800 --> 24:37.062
Mm-hmm.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.204
Drunk and disorderly,
simple assault.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.276
In Daytona Beach.

24:41.310 --> 24:43.039
Not a good thing.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.605
Yes. Terrible.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.106
And your debts.

24:47.150 --> 24:49.516
$18,000 to the Oceanfront Inn.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.142
I think they're still
looking for you.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.717
Peter can be quite generous.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.217
This is a check for $25,000.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.148
It's his personal
thank you to you.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.021
You tell Jackie
you had some issues in Florida.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.527
And why would I do that?

25:06.570 --> 25:09.289
Oh, well, to be blunt,
Peter is going to be governor,

25:09.340 --> 25:12.207
and he thinks
you're using his mother.

25:31.090 --> 25:33.149
Oh. What's going on?

25:33.190 --> 25:34.748
Nothing.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.893
Abernathy is on
a sciatica walk,

25:36.930 --> 25:39.262
and the guard won't let
us in until he's back.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.291
Go ahead and sleep.

25:42.770 --> 25:47.207
* Lumina

25:47.240 --> 25:49.276
* Come and wrap around me...

25:49.310 --> 25:51.107
You broke up with Laura?

25:51.150 --> 25:54.244
No. She with me.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.248
I'm sorry.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.316
You're still friends?

25:58.350 --> 26:00.545
I don't know.

26:01.990 --> 26:04.129
I think she thinks

26:04.160 --> 26:05.980
I was getting
between you two.

26:06.030 --> 26:08.225
* Eve took a train

26:08.260 --> 26:11.229
* Went to see her man...

26:13.640 --> 26:16.564
That kiss opened up something
between us again, didn't it?

26:18.140 --> 26:20.267
I don't know how to close it.

26:21.310 --> 26:24.040
I know.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.971
But if we pursue it,
it'll just be like last time.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.147
What was last time?

26:30.180 --> 26:32.148
I don't know.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.158
It'll be worse.

26:34.190 --> 26:38.081
I'm with Peter, and I just...

26:38.130 --> 26:40.086
* Take me through the snow...

26:40.130 --> 26:42.849
I can't figure
my way out of this one.

26:42.900 --> 26:47.667
* Eve took the fruit,
Eve bit the fruit *

26:47.700 --> 26:52.831
* Juice ran down her chin

26:52.870 --> 26:57.239
* Babies who put things
in their mouths *

26:57.280 --> 27:00.044
* Never heard of sin...

27:00.080 --> 27:02.048
Oh, God.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.082
(sighs)

27:05.320 --> 27:07.311
What do we do?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.351
(knocking)

27:12.390 --> 27:17.089
* Lumina

27:17.130 --> 27:20.167
* Open up the cities...

27:20.200 --> 27:22.259
This night is over, we talk.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.904
We can't.
To hell with

27:23.940 --> 27:25.908
the bad timing.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.168
We talk.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.303
(car door bell dings)

27:29.340 --> 27:30.329
Psst, Judy? Judy?

27:30.380 --> 27:32.848
(laughs)
Yeah.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.017
Uh, so,

27:34.050 --> 27:35.711
I imagine your field trip
was productive.

27:35.750 --> 27:36.717
Yes, Your Honor.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.741
And when we left, you
were ready to decide.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.712
Actually, Your Honor,
we do have one more witness.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.113
Oh, not poor Nana Joe again.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.787
I think
she was ready to collapse.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.923
No, a new witness.
Jordan

27:45.960 --> 27:47.222
Kallahaleycar...

27:47.260 --> 27:48.420
Jordan Karahalios?
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.449
We have to object to
this on the grounds...

27:49.500 --> 27:50.899
ALICIA:
He was fired from
the Florrick...

27:50.930 --> 27:52.727
And how many
months did you work

27:52.770 --> 27:53.737
for Mr. Florrick's campaign?

27:53.770 --> 27:55.362
Three. I was relieved
of my duties in March.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.334
So you have some insider

27:57.370 --> 27:59.702
information on the issue
of this ballot box?

27:59.740 --> 28:02.709
I do. Uh, at a meeting
on February 18,

28:02.740 --> 28:05.868
Eli Gold and I discussed ways
to sweeten the vote

28:05.910 --> 28:07.844
if the election was close.
And what were Mr. Gold's

28:07.880 --> 28:09.711
thoughts on
this sweetening?

28:09.750 --> 28:11.388
A drop box.
Objection, Your Honor.

28:11.420 --> 28:12.648
This witness is doubly biased.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.454
He was fired by our client, and
he works for the third party.

28:15.490 --> 28:17.720
Then you can argue that
in your cross.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.024
PA'I'I'I:
And did you argue
against this drop box?

28:20.060 --> 28:21.857
He likes the third-party
candidate.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.458
I did, strenuously, but

28:23.500 --> 28:25.491
I was overruled by Mr. Gold.

28:25.530 --> 28:30.035
It is almost 5:00 am. now.

28:30.070 --> 28:33.506
The polls will be open
in one hour, and

28:33.540 --> 28:36.998
I find myself humbled in
the face of this decision.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.873
As has been said
by many of you

28:39.910 --> 28:43.880
at various times,
there is a sanctity

28:43.920 --> 28:47.310
to the voting booth, but...

28:47.350 --> 28:48.055
Uh-oh.

28:48.090 --> 28:50.820
...that sanctity
is not absolute.

28:50.860 --> 28:54.990
It needs our
constant VIgIIance.

28:55.030 --> 28:57.157
It needs our confidence

28:57.200 --> 29:00.419
that the votes are,
in fact, true.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.768
I hereby am ordering

29:04.810 --> 29:09.770
that these 30,843 votes
be excluded

29:09.810 --> 29:11.846
from any vote total,
and that they be

29:11.880 --> 29:14.348
provisionally preserved
for a possible appeal.

29:14.380 --> 29:16.109
And good night.

29:16.150 --> 29:17.310
Get some rest.

29:17.350 --> 29:18.840
(gavelbangs)

29:18.890 --> 29:20.289
I'll start
the appeal process.

29:22.490 --> 29:23.684
I better go tell Peter.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.280
Sad to think you can lose an
election in court these days.

29:35.300 --> 29:36.858
(birds chirping)

29:36.900 --> 29:39.368
Why the hurry, huh?

29:39.410 --> 29:41.503
The place is gonna blow.
Yeah?

29:41.540 --> 29:43.178
(grunts)

29:44.550 --> 29:48.543
(men grunting,
car alarm wailing on TV)

29:48.580 --> 29:50.138
(man screams)

29:50.180 --> 29:53.240
What time is it?

29:53.290 --> 29:54.587
5:45.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.918
Polls open in 15 minutes.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.053
(men screaming)

29:59.090 --> 30:01.297
What are you watching?

30:01.330 --> 30:03.594
Hostel 3.

30:03.630 --> 30:05.097
(screaming continues)

30:07.530 --> 30:09.896
Do you know why I love
horror movies?

30:09.940 --> 30:11.168
Why?

30:11.210 --> 30:13.872
Because they're awesome.

30:13.910 --> 30:16.834
(chuckles)

30:19.110 --> 30:21.112
(man screams)

30:23.120 --> 30:25.315
We're gonna lose, aren't we?

30:27.390 --> 30:28.459
Yes.

30:28.490 --> 30:29.514
Is Peter prepared?

30:29.560 --> 30:32.882
He's adjusted his thinking.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.623
You ran_ _
a great campaIgn, ElI.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.524
(chuckles)

30:40.570 --> 30:44.006
(men grunting on TV)

30:44.040 --> 30:45.598
He'll need you.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.830
He loves you.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.618
(men grunting, swords clanging)

31:06.660 --> 31:08.252
Mom... what's up?

31:08.300 --> 31:10.598
Shh, shh, shh.
I have an idea.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.222
I need your help.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.032
Thank you, Your Honor,

31:15.070 --> 31:16.594
for hearing one
of our witnesses again.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.959
Your Honor,
I think

31:18.010 --> 31:20.535
I speak
for the whole world when I say

31:20.570 --> 31:22.231
can we please all
get some sleep?

31:22.280 --> 31:23.372
Patience, Ms. Nyholm.

31:23.410 --> 31:25.901
Zach, you're still
under oath.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.475
So you've been working
for the Florrick campaign

31:28.520 --> 31:29.578
these last seven months.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.986
Yes, in the IT
department.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.580
ABERNATHY:
Ah, good mornIng.
We've sent out for bagels.

31:34.620 --> 31:36.417
Thank you, Your Honor.

31:36.460 --> 31:39.520
Now Jordan Karahalios stated
that Eli met with him

31:39.560 --> 31:42.256
on February 18, and told him,
over Jordan's objections,

31:42.300 --> 31:45.929
that they needed to
consider a stuffed ballot box.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.221
Are you aware
of this testimony?

31:47.270 --> 31:48.567
I've been made aware of it.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.636
And do you know this testimony
to be false?

31:50.670 --> 31:51.637
I do.

31:51.670 --> 31:53.228
How do you know that?

31:53.270 --> 31:55.670
Because Eli wasn't the campaign
manager on February 18.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.177
He had been replaced by Jordan.

31:57.210 --> 31:59.405
So Jordan couldn't have
been overruled by Eli?

31:59.450 --> 32:01.042
Or anyone?

32:01.080 --> 32:02.115
JORDAN:
Not true!

32:02.150 --> 32:04.345
Eli Gold was still consulting
with the campaign.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.210
Mr. Karahulois-isis,
please take your seat.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.582
So, Jordan was the
campaign manager

32:08.620 --> 32:09.689
at that point
in time?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.722
He was the boss?
Yes, that's correct.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.421
I tender the witness.

32:13.460 --> 32:16.020
So let's return to your arrest,
shall we?

32:16.060 --> 32:18.028
No, Counselor. We've pretty
much bounced every way

32:18.070 --> 32:19.697
we can on_ this witness's
reIIabIIIty.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.039
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.
You may step down.

32:22.070 --> 32:25.107
Uh, you'll have my revised
ruling in a few hours.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.698
(gavelbangs)

32:26.740 --> 32:28.139
You were great.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.272
Thanks.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.109
ROBYN:
Hey, what you watching?

32:34.150 --> 32:36.539
Video.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.582
Can I ask you
a hypothetical?

32:38.620 --> 32:39.712
No.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.685
So let's say
I'm approached

32:42.720 --> 32:44.449
about leaving
the law firm,

32:44.490 --> 32:47.379
and joining a small
start-up firm, right?

32:47.430 --> 32:49.250
And I'm offered more
money than here.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.653
But I like it here.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.065
And I'll also
probably like it

32:52.100 --> 32:53.362
at this law firm, too.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.130
So do you make
your decision

32:56.170 --> 32:58.661
based on money or loyalty?

32:58.710 --> 33:02.009
Um, how much more money
are they offering you?

33:02.040 --> 33:05.168
In my hypothetical?
In your hypothetical.

33:05.210 --> 33:08.543
It's a good
amount-- 20% more.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.758
Hey, what do I do?

33:19.790 --> 33:21.758
You should go with Cary.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.132
Will, you'd better
see this.

33:30.170 --> 33:33.469
Kalinda...
I was up all night.

33:33.510 --> 33:36.502
I know. So was I. Will.

33:38.380 --> 33:40.348
WILL:
That's outside
the polling place.

33:40.380 --> 33:43.440
KALINDA:
Yeah. A surveillance
camera across the street.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.082
Jim Moody.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.111
He works
for the Florrick campaign.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.754
Where'd you get this?

33:52.790 --> 33:56.396
Talked to the mini-mart
across the street.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.658
Are there any
other copies?

34:00.700 --> 34:03.089
No. Just this one.

34:09.410 --> 34:11.844
PETER:
I heard it went well in court.

34:11.880 --> 34:15.839
It did.
Your son did good.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.519
But you have
something for me?

34:18.550 --> 34:19.812
(door opens, indistinct chatter)

34:19.850 --> 34:22.353
Can you just give us
a minute please?

34:22.390 --> 34:24.529
Thank you.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.755
(door closes)
Kalinda _found
some eVIdence.

34:26.790 --> 34:28.792
No one else
has seen It.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.721
And you're telling
me this why?

34:33.770 --> 34:35.738
I want to know
what to do with it.

34:35.770 --> 34:38.637
Well, you're the
lawyer. You decide.

34:38.670 --> 34:42.299
This decision needs
to be the client's.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.342
Why are you doing this?

34:44.380 --> 34:45.847
I need direction.
No, If you
needed direction,

34:45.880 --> 34:48.519
you'd have given it
to Alicia to show me.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.482
I didn't want to hurt her.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.588
You've really
handled this poorly.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.655
That's possible.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.168
She's my wife.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.327
Then punch me.

35:11.770 --> 35:13.738
(sighs)

35:13.770 --> 35:17.729
It shows your 30,000 votes
are fraudulent.

35:17.780 --> 35:21.147
If it goes to the judge,
you'll lose.

35:23.550 --> 35:26.519
Then I'll lose.

35:26.550 --> 35:30.350
This seems to be some kind of
a lesson In mutual hypocrIsy

35:30.390 --> 35:31.687
which I'm not gonna
participate in.

35:31.730 --> 35:32.822
So you want me to bury it?

35:32.860 --> 35:34.350
Do what you want.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.823
You want me to lose,
show it to the judge.

35:36.860 --> 35:40.364
You want me to win, don't.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.198
I'm not owning this decision.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.740
(sighs)
What do you think?

36:00.790 --> 36:02.781
I think we're good.

36:09.330 --> 36:11.969
(door opens)
Mm.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.969
Oh, no, no, no.
Everybody, sit down. I'm fine.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.560
(sighs)

36:17.600 --> 36:19.568
Okay, so,

36:19.610 --> 36:22.408
uh, in thinking over
my early determination,

36:22.440 --> 36:24.408
I thought of a story.

36:24.450 --> 36:27.203
Uh, it's about a very young boy,

36:27.250 --> 36:29.218
um, an old man

36:29.250 --> 36:31.241
and a donkey.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.882
(sighs)
What the hell, I'm too tired.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.387
Judgment in favor
of the defense.

36:34.420 --> 36:35.910
The votes are to be admitted.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.916
We did it.
(chuckles)

36:37.960 --> 36:39.325
Thank you.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.897
Thank you.

36:41.930 --> 36:45.696
It's a good thing.
(chuckles)
It is.

36:45.730 --> 36:47.721
(loud cheering, whooping)

36:47.770 --> 36:49.761
(cheering, whooping continues)

36:55.310 --> 36:56.868
Oh, my God.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.946
I didn't think
that would happen!

36:58.980 --> 37:00.379
And did you see
the totals?
Hey!

37:00.410 --> 37:01.946
You won by over
a half million votes.

37:01.980 --> 37:03.413
What?
Yeah, yeah.

37:03.450 --> 37:04.542
Oh, the polling was off.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.683
We didn't need to go to court,
and fight tooth and nail.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.880
(laughing)

37:07.920 --> 37:10.013
Hey, where's Alicia?
I have to find Alicia.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.654
No. You got to be downstairs
in the ballroom in 15 minutes.

37:12.690 --> 37:13.657
And you-know-who's here.

37:13.690 --> 37:14.452
He made it?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.320
Yeah, yeah,
he's here for a meeting

37:16.360 --> 37:17.827
of his, uh,
reduce gun violence coalition.

37:17.860 --> 37:20.260
Peter, congratulations.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.562
Or should I say condolences?

37:21.600 --> 37:22.999
(laughing)
With the deficit you're gonna
have to deal with.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.361
_ _ Eli.
ElI, nIce to see you.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.366
This is my deputy mayor,
Patty Harris.
Nice to meet you.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.970
Listen, I've got tickets, uh,
any time you want them

37:30.010 --> 37:31.568
for the Cubs World Series.

37:31.610 --> 37:33.999
That's a pretty safe
thing to offer.
(laughs)

37:34.050 --> 37:35.608
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

37:35.650 --> 37:36.776
JACKIE:
Peter.
Mom!

37:36.820 --> 37:39.311
I am so proud of you.

37:39.350 --> 37:41.614
Oh, I knew you could do it.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.957
I knew it.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.548
Congratulations, Mr. Florrick.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.021
Uh, thanks, Cristian.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.857
Have you got a moment?

37:49.900 --> 37:50.696
Yes.

37:53.700 --> 37:55.065
(softly):
Eli talked to you, right?

37:55.100 --> 37:55.964
What?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.934
Eli talked to you, right?

37:57.970 --> 37:58.937
Oh, he did.

37:58.970 --> 38:00.335
We had a very good talk.

38:00.370 --> 38:01.200
Yeah.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.333
Well, he gave you
the $25,000 check?

38:03.380 --> 38:04.847
Yes, I cashed it.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.040
Thank you.

38:06.080 --> 38:06.978
No... no.

38:07.010 --> 38:09.012
That was so you'd leave.

38:09.050 --> 38:09.948
No, I don't think so.

38:09.980 --> 38:12.016
Yes, it was.

38:12.050 --> 38:14.655
Well, I don't want to go.

38:14.690 --> 38:16.885
It's not about
what you want.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.582
(laughing):
Yes, it is.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.461
(sighs)

38:28.500 --> 38:30.639
Hey. You startled me.

38:30.670 --> 38:33.104
Florrick won
the governorship.

38:33.140 --> 38:34.107
Yeah, I saw.

38:34.140 --> 38:35.869
What's up?

38:38.080 --> 38:40.105
Don't ever do that to me again.

38:40.150 --> 38:42.015
Do what?
Lead me on with

38:42.050 --> 38:44.018
a salary proposal
and then go to Robyn.

38:44.050 --> 38:46.109
Kalinda...

38:46.150 --> 38:47.788
Go to hell, Cary.

38:47.820 --> 38:48.980
And good luck with Robyn.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.487
Kalinda...

38:51.930 --> 38:53.352
Kalinda.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.568
(loud cheering, whooping)

38:58.600 --> 39:00.568
(laughing)

39:00.600 --> 39:01.760
Hey, there you are!

39:04.000 --> 39:05.001
Congratulations!

39:05.040 --> 39:07.463
Zach! Zach, come here,
come here.

39:07.510 --> 39:09.535
You really helped me out.
You know that, don't you?

39:09.580 --> 39:10.729
Dad, it was nothing.

39:10.780 --> 39:13.044
It was something.
It was something.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.001
Mom...

39:14.050 --> 39:15.415
Alicia's in the bedroom.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.509
Okay.

39:17.550 --> 39:19.814
It's my life.
It's not yours.

39:19.850 --> 39:21.147
Don't mess with it.

39:21.190 --> 39:23.385
Even

39:25.530 --> 39:27.521
Congratulations, son.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.991
(chattering, cheering continue
in other room)

40:05.630 --> 40:07.621
PETER:
There you are.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.039
We did it.

40:12.070 --> 40:13.708
(Alicia laughs)

40:13.740 --> 40:14.707
Thank you.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.173
Oh, no reason to thank me.

40:16.210 --> 40:17.177
You did it.

40:17.210 --> 40:18.541
How are you?

40:18.580 --> 40:19.877
Good.

40:19.910 --> 40:21.946
How's it feel to be
the First Lady of Illinois?

40:21.980 --> 40:24.119
(laughs) Odd.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.481
Odd.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.646
I need to freshen up.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.487
You good?
Good...

40:28.520 --> 40:29.589
yeah, I'm good.

40:29.620 --> 40:32.020
Just... un-fresh.

40:32.060 --> 40:33.482
(chuckles)

40:34.130 --> 40:36.519
Hi. Congratulations.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.528
Oh. (laughs)

40:42.270 --> 40:44.830
(sighs)

40:58.790 --> 40:59.779
Hi.

41:00.850 --> 41:02.886
One second!

41:06.290 --> 41:08.258
Do you still want to talk?

41:08.290 --> 41:09.655
Meet me at my apartment.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.827
I'll... I'll get away.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.826
Right now.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.199
(exhales)

41:27.310 --> 41:29.517
*

41:51.940 --> 41:53.965
(door opening, keys clatter)

41:54.010 --> 41:56.001
(door closes)

42:21.070 --> 42:23.061
(Bach concerto playing)

42:40.250 --> 42:42.309
(music continues)

42:42.360 --> 42:44.316
Is this stupid?

42:46.930 --> 42:47.885
(exhales)

42:47.930 --> 42:49.921
(knocking on door)

42:58.200 --> 42:59.758
Thanks for doing this here.

43:00.810 --> 43:02.801
No problem.

43:04.310 --> 43:05.345
What are you thinking?

43:05.380 --> 43:07.871
(exhales)

43:07.910 --> 43:09.309
I'm in.
