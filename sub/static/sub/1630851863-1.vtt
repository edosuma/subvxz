00:06.120 --> 00:08.600
PREVIOUSLY ON MYTHOMANIAC

00:09.600 --> 00:11.960
Any trouble at home, Elvira?

00:12.040 --> 00:14.480
Feeling overwhelmed by the kids?

00:14.560 --> 00:15.920
I hate you.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.200
-At work?
-You didn't get the chips?

00:18.280 --> 00:19.840
Housewives are slaves.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.080
I lied to Patrick.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.720
What's wrong with you?

00:23.800 --> 00:24.800
A tumor.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.240
-Mom's got breast cancer.
-A tumor.

00:27.320 --> 00:31.720
<i>Oddly enough, all of a sudden</i>
<i>everybody was so nice to me.</i>

00:31.800 --> 00:33.600
This is a wake-up call.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.720
Elvira? Will you marry me?

00:38.640 --> 00:39.520
What about Brigitte?

00:39.600 --> 00:42.360
I've been wanting to break up.
She's too needy.

00:42.960 --> 00:43.960
<i>Lying.</i>

00:44.040 --> 00:46.200
Not just anyone can pull it off.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.600
It has to be airtight.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.240
There's no turning back.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.880
If I turned out to be healthy,
would you still marry me?

00:53.560 --> 00:55.520
Beware your neighbors, always.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.000
A test will tell us
if you're really open to loving energies.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.160
-Elvira Giannini.
-Sorry.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.520
-She's not a patient here.
-Dad!

01:05.440 --> 01:07.080
I lied. I'm not sick.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.360
Your mother's illness is made up.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.200
-She lied to us.
-How could you put us through that?

01:14.840 --> 01:16.560
Get out of here.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.240
I'm looking
for Maria Magdalena Giannini's house.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.080
I'm Lorenzo.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.520
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:14.560 --> 02:15.640
-Good evening.
-Hi.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.000
We're collecting toys.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.240
For the needy.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.160
Sure.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.040
Honey, bring me the big bag.
The one in the kitchen.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.240
We saw your flyer.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.440
Is your dad all right?

02:26.960 --> 02:28.000
Hanging in there.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.640
You've heard of our group?

02:30.720 --> 02:31.920
"Awakening to Life"?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.080
I have, a little.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.120
We help the poor, but we also give talks.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.880
About self-esteem.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.920
We're not interested.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.680
What child would be happy
to get this for Christmas?

02:59.920 --> 03:01.160
<i>She's sweet enough.</i>

03:01.240 --> 03:04.360
But the husband? A complete jerk.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.960
You always laugh when I say rude things.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.560
It's nice to see you smile.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.320
Let's head home, we're done for tonight.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.560
I have a surprise for you.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.600
-For real?
-I want to thank you for being here.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.600
Cool.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.840
Not to rush this,
but there's five minutes left.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.000
It's not done.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.520
Unbelievable.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.160
Just wait. It's not done.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.800
What if it's not ready on time?

03:49.880 --> 03:52.120
It needs to stew, a good long while.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.600
You'll see.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.800
What's that weird smell?

03:58.880 --> 04:00.240
There's something missing.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.320
Sour cream.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.040
You think?

04:06.160 --> 04:07.040
What's up with him?

04:07.120 --> 04:09.440
Sam asked Renan over.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.520
-Renan?
-His boyfriend, I think.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.280
Not yet.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.600
But Sam's hoping.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.800
Of course there's no cream left.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.320
How about milk?

04:19.400 --> 04:21.000
We have some.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.280
-You hungry?
-Like crazy.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.640
We're the only house
without Christmas ornaments.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.000
It's stupid.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.960
-This smells horrible.
-Hands off!

04:31.040 --> 04:33.080
Cooking is like love.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.120
You have to do it from the heart.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.320
And with clean hands.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.360
Maybe we should order out.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.800
Is there any cash left?

04:40.320 --> 04:41.160
No idea.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.600
This is the worst.

04:55.800 --> 04:56.680
Hi!

04:58.160 --> 04:59.000
Hi.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.760
Your dad invited me for dinner.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.680
Okay.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.680
-He didn't tell you?
-No.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.040
But… sure.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.240
You like strawberries?

05:13.320 --> 05:14.560
You invited Sandrine?

05:15.400 --> 05:16.840
I don't think so.

05:16.920 --> 05:17.920
Hi, Sonia.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.000
Hi, there.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.800
Hi there, Sandrine.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.360
I made dessert.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.200
And I brought wine.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.760
-All right.
-I'll put the cake in the kitchen.

05:30.840 --> 05:31.960
You okay, Virginie?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.320
Hi, Carole.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.760
Good evening, Renan.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.760
Are you boys taking the same classes?

05:46.840 --> 05:48.320
No, I'm in prep school.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.360
-Really?
-Yes.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.680
But it's in the same place.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.720
-Want some bread?
-No.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.280
On top of his schoolwork,

05:53.360 --> 05:55.920
Renan's also writing a novel.

05:57.040 --> 05:57.920
He's so talented.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.600
Thanks, but… how would you know?

06:02.200 --> 06:03.400
You didn't read anything.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.240
Don't you have to be dead
to be a novelist?

06:06.880 --> 06:09.560
-Or at least very old?
-Sonia, you want some more?

06:09.640 --> 06:12.000
No, I'm not that hungry.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.400
Carole, Sam?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.280
-No, thank you.
-Patrick.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.640
Just a little.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.960
We can move on to dessert.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.720
This is nice,
all of us here for a good meal.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.760
A family dinner.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.080
Too bad Mom's not here.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.320
Virginie.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.960
Stop.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.000
I'm just saying.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.560
What about Christmas?

06:35.640 --> 06:38.840
-It's ten days away.
-Don't mention her right now.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.920
-We're going.
-So am I.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.320
Really?

06:43.400 --> 06:45.120
Maybe ask Daddy first?

06:45.960 --> 06:46.880
Is he your dad?

06:47.840 --> 06:51.880
-No.
-Then why call him "Daddy"?

06:51.960 --> 06:55.560
We get it, you're a smartass. Sit down.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.280
Girls, everyone. Sit back down.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.800
What do your parents do?

07:05.880 --> 07:07.600
I can't even…

07:07.680 --> 07:09.800
Do you mind?
I'm curious about Sam's boyfriend.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.240
-Man.
-My mom's a lawyer.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.880
My dad manages the hardware store
at the edge of town.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.040
By the gym?

07:19.120 --> 07:20.080
That's right.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.560
I know him well, he comes in a lot.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.080
-Does he?
-That's funny.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.520
Sandrine?

07:26.440 --> 07:29.760
Please don't mention this dinner
to Renan's Dad.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.520
-Sure.
-Why not?

07:34.160 --> 07:35.680
He's not allowed to see me.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.360
-Sam.
-His parents don't know he's here.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.160
You lied to his parents?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.560
No, we just…

07:45.640 --> 07:47.080
I'm against it, damn it!

07:47.560 --> 07:50.800
There won't be any more lies
in this family, am I clear?

07:53.520 --> 07:54.440
Sorry.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.240
Thanks a lot, Sandrine.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.800
Virginie, just be nice to her.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.520
Don't forget she paid
for school lunches, the dentist's bill…

08:04.600 --> 08:07.840
-Swimming gear.
-That too. So just be nice.

08:07.920 --> 08:12.120
Actually, you should thank her.
Go ahead, thank her.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.640
There was brie at lunch today.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.120
That's it.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.160
But…

08:22.040 --> 08:23.200
Don't be like that.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.640
-Sandrine.
-Forget it.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.960
You guys are really not helping.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.320
Really.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.920
It's not our fault.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.080
-You're the one toying with her.
-Making her believe you'll have sex.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.800
I've had it with you all.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.360
Can I come in?

09:14.520 --> 09:15.680
Hi, Clemence.

09:15.760 --> 09:16.760
Hi, Elvira.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.320
How was dinner at Mrs. Menard's?

09:19.400 --> 09:23.080
Wasn't much of a dinner. We role-played.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.320
I was a dog, my husband was a cow.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.480
What about you?

09:30.680 --> 09:33.800
The kids went to bed early.
I read them three stories.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.120
How did it go at home?

09:37.240 --> 09:38.640
Sandrine was there.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.080
Not for long, though.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.640
Sam invited this Renan guy.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.440
You know? That has me worried,
he has terrible taste in boys.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.000
And apparently, Sonia's moved in.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.720
I heard her parents were splitting up.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.280
I saw Virginie. Wearing makeup.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.480
A little too much of it.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.320
I have a letter for her.

10:03.960 --> 10:04.920
Here.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.080
-Got it.
-Clemence?

10:06.160 --> 10:07.240
Where are you?

10:07.320 --> 10:08.920
He's always hounding me.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.600
You coming?

10:10.680 --> 10:11.960
I'll be right there!

10:13.960 --> 10:14.880
I have to go.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.480
-Good night.
-You too.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.920
Can you explain one thing?

10:31.520 --> 10:33.320
Your dad sleeps in a doghouse?

10:36.560 --> 10:39.520
Because of my mom,
he won't sleep in their old room anymore.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.760
Have you heard from her?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.320
Sometimes. Stuff finds its way to me.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.600
-Do you miss her?
-Please don't.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.400
I don't know.

10:51.000 --> 10:51.880
Okay.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.400
I miss my mom from before the lie.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.560
You smell nice.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.720
Unlike your dad.

11:11.880 --> 11:12.720
Bye.

11:15.080 --> 11:15.920
Bye.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.880
<i>To my daughter, the first, most cherished.</i>

11:31.960 --> 11:33.160
<i>My pride.</i>

11:35.040 --> 11:37.000
<i>Remember that I think of you, all day,</i>

11:37.080 --> 11:38.320
<i>every day.</i>

11:39.640 --> 11:41.800
<i>You're in my thoughts, always.</i>

11:42.400 --> 11:43.920
<i>Even when we're apart.</i>

11:47.880 --> 11:50.120
<i>Keep being the brave girl you are.</i>

11:50.640 --> 11:52.080
Hurry up, we'll be late.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.920
<i>Be forgiving towards yourself</i>

11:54.000 --> 11:55.280
<i>and others.</i>

11:56.840 --> 12:00.240
<i>I promise, one day,</i>
<i>things will be the way they were.</i>

12:01.120 --> 12:02.280
<i>Well, almost.</i>

12:03.720 --> 12:05.680
<i>Give your sister and brother</i>
<i>a kiss from me.</i>

12:05.760 --> 12:07.600
<i>Tell them how much I love them.</i>

12:11.960 --> 12:13.440
-From mom?
-Yeah.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.040
Everything okay?

12:16.840 --> 12:17.720
Yeah.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.960
-I could read it aloud.
-No.

12:25.760 --> 12:30.520
Lacan famously wrote, "Oedipus
never went through an Oedipus complex."

12:31.200 --> 12:34.320
What does it mean?
Today, the term "Oedipus complex"

12:35.040 --> 12:39.040
is used to refer to complicated
relationships with the father figure.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.560
When Oedipus killed his father,

12:42.640 --> 12:45.920
he had no idea it was his father. So,

12:47.240 --> 12:50.840
he's not going through
what we call the Oedipus Complex.

12:51.640 --> 12:57.600
Quite the opposite, in fact. He's fleeing
the people he believes are his parents.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.680
Why? To stop the prophecy
from coming true.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.440
All of that after becoming king of Thebes

13:06.320 --> 13:08.320
and having married his own mother,

13:09.840 --> 13:13.760
all because he gave the right answer
to the Sphinx's riddle.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.800
Who remembers the riddle?

13:15.880 --> 13:18.640
He just wants to stop the prophecy
from coming to pass.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.720
He wanted

13:21.840 --> 13:23.160
to protect his parents

13:23.240 --> 13:24.680
and ends up killing his father.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.600
Sir?

13:26.120 --> 13:27.880
-Yes?
-I need to use the bathroom.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.440
Wait for the break.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.800
It's really urgent, sir.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.760
Sir, that's not cool.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.200
Yeah, be nice.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.120
What does Lacan's analysis teach us?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.440
What are you doing?

13:46.040 --> 13:47.440
Aren't you glad to see me?

13:47.520 --> 13:48.400
Yes.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.840
I wanted to spend some time
with you, cousin.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.320
I have classes until noon.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.400
See you after that?

14:02.800 --> 14:03.680
What?

14:10.080 --> 14:11.040
What are you doing?

14:15.960 --> 14:17.520
Lunch is gonna come early.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.240
Are you completely mad?

14:48.560 --> 14:49.480
Is this right?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Yeah.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.320
Awesome. I'm loving this.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.440
Shit.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.240
No big deal. Hold on.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.320
I'll start it back up.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.320
Ready? Good.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.160
There.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.360
Cool.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.360
Are you having dinner with us?

15:15.520 --> 15:17.720
Don't know. I guess?

15:20.400 --> 15:21.760
Will your mom be there?

15:22.520 --> 15:24.440
Well… no.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.920
Any news?

15:28.680 --> 15:29.640
Yes.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.200
She writes to Virginie.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.520
Am I doing it right?

15:36.600 --> 15:38.240
Yeah. Keep going.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.520
Where does she live?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.400
I don't know.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.680
Don't mention the letters to my dad.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.960
Of course not.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.560
How's he doing?

15:50.000 --> 15:50.960
He's hurting.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.160
Let's eat.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.200
Okay.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.000
I have no money, though.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.640
Don't worry, I'm buying.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.680
The lasagna is in the fridge, top shelf.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.520
Great. Thank you, ladies.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.600
We have to tell you something.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.880
-We're going to Pleucadeuc.
-It's in Morbihan.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.640
For the big convention.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.320
"Single French Twins."

16:28.040 --> 16:31.480
Hang on a minute.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.440
How long will you be gone?

16:36.520 --> 16:37.880
Two weeks.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.880
Maybe more if we get lucky.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.680
Two weeks?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.680
That's forever.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.640
How will I manage?

16:50.480 --> 16:51.400
All right.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.960
I hope you gals have fun.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.280
Yes?

17:05.720 --> 17:08.800
I'm done with the ironing.
I just need to make the bed.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.240
I'll help.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.720
Thanks.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.320
There's something I have to tell you.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.600
Go ahead.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.520
My husband's family is coming to visit
over Christmas break.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.760
So,

17:27.320 --> 17:28.840
we'll need the room.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.640
Family?

17:32.720 --> 17:33.560
I'm sorry?

17:33.640 --> 17:35.840
Who is this "family" coming over?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.480
That's none of your business.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.360
You've been locked up here for weeks.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.720
You said it would only be a few days.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.720
The kids had to move into the guest room.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.080
-And my husband…
-Tell him I'll work more.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.960
-That's not the point.
-You can't do this.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.960
You know I need this window
to see my kids.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.320
It's time you did something.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.160
Go and talk to Patrick and the kids.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.040
You can't spy on them forever.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.440
I'm not spying. I'm watching them live.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.840
I'm not ready to go back.

18:10.720 --> 18:11.880
I need more time.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.240
Keep waiting and one day,
they just won't need you anymore.

18:24.160 --> 18:25.800
They're doing just fine without me.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.760
Being a mom is just being a housemaid.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.760
You clearly need your kids,
even if they don't need you.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.960
Make a bit of an effort.
Christmas is coming up.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.720
It's a time for forgiveness.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.600
See you.

19:03.320 --> 19:05.000
They can't always know what's up.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.600
They can imagine.
It's the same thing in <i>Vertigo</i>,

19:08.680 --> 19:10.440
with the disappearance…

19:17.120 --> 19:17.960
Bye.

19:18.040 --> 19:18.960
Bye.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.360
Nice car.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.480
Isn't it?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.000
Nice cousin too.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.160
Forget it, you're not his type.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.960
Like you know his type?

19:36.720 --> 19:39.160
Three months ago,
you didn't know he existed.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.200
Still, he's family.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.040
Yeah, right. "Family."

19:44.760 --> 19:46.360
Are you coming or what?

19:47.280 --> 19:48.480
Actually…

20:05.280 --> 20:06.120
Come in!

20:08.560 --> 20:09.480
Hey.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.400
You're back.

20:10.920 --> 20:11.760
Yes.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.840
There's no one.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.040
We live in a time of jerks.

20:17.680 --> 20:21.360
People stay home eating shit
ordered on the Internet.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.200
Where have you been?

20:26.960 --> 20:30.280
Around Nice.
But I didn’t find anything interesting.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.520
And you?

20:41.120 --> 20:43.680
-Have you heard from her?
-Wait.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.440
This letter.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.680
She says she is doing fine,

20:49.760 --> 20:51.280
but I don't know where she is.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
As usual.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.600
You know, I'm already sick
of this situation.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.840
What are you doing?
Are you staying here tonight?

21:06.920 --> 21:09.400
It's Karina. Where is she?

21:09.920 --> 21:13.600
It's Karina… If they ask you, just say
you don't know where she is.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.160
I got it.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.320
-Hello.
-Hello.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.760
What would make you happy?

21:20.840 --> 21:22.520
One 8 1/2, please.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.240
-Coming up.
-Thanks.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.600
You're welcome.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.480
Could you drop this off
at my house tonight?

21:51.120 --> 21:52.520
It can't wait.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
Of course.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.080
Thank you.

22:09.120 --> 22:13.040
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME ANYMORE?

22:21.200 --> 22:22.280
Dad?

22:23.360 --> 22:25.200
Maybe it's time you showered.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.040
We can all hear the shower running,
but you never get in.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.760
You're faking it.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.480
Am I?

22:37.760 --> 22:38.800
I smell like shit.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.440
I feel like shit. Because of your mother.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.360
-Shit's supposed to stink.
-I get it.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.600
But you have to do something.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.760
Renan thought you were sleeping
in a doghouse.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.320
Like a dog.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.520
People already think we're weird.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.480
FROM: RENAN

23:12.080 --> 23:13.000
I'm there.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.040
-Hi.
-Hi.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.440
You're low-key harassing me.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.600
Sorry about all the texts.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.600
I thought you were avoiding me.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.560
You walked right by me today,
without a glance.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.160
No.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.840
I did see you.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.120
But I was talking to Louise

23:53.840 --> 23:55.680
about a short story I wrote.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.600
She doesn't understand.

23:58.720 --> 23:59.760
Okay.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.440
I just thought,

24:02.520 --> 24:06.680
"Dinner bored the fuck out of him
and he thinks my family's weird."

24:10.040 --> 24:11.800
-It is weird.
-Yes.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.200
But I had fun.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.400
You don't know how lucky you are.

24:19.720 --> 24:23.600
My family is so completely dull.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.000
No writing material there.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.800
Someday, I'd love to read
some of your stuff.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.840
You can't just do that.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.840
It's just not done.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.960
You never ask a writer to read his work.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.240
-Sorry.
-No.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.360
-So inappropriate.
-I didn't know.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.560
Well, now you know.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.000
I do.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.720
I have homework to finish.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.200
See you.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.000
Hi, Patrick.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.320
Hi, Lorenzo.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.680
-It's nice to see you.
-Here.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.160
Thanks.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.440
I'll pay you later.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.920
Money's a bit tight.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.080
Don't worry about it.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.480
There's a letter for you.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.000
-Bills?
-No.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.320
It's handwritten.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.760
That's…

26:18.920 --> 26:21.000
That's Elvira's handwriting.

26:25.480 --> 26:26.640
Read it for me.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.000
Okay.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.360
"Patrick, I've thought long and hard
about all of this."

26:41.440 --> 26:45.240
"Everything's that's happened to us
had been brewing

26:46.600 --> 26:47.840
for a very long time."

26:49.240 --> 26:51.000
"For years, perhaps."

26:52.200 --> 26:55.280
"Our daily routine with the kids
wore us out,

26:55.360 --> 26:56.560
the both of us."

26:56.640 --> 26:58.160
"We were exhausted."

26:58.240 --> 27:00.160
"Something had to give

27:00.760 --> 27:02.560
for some things to change."

27:05.760 --> 27:06.800
"I'd like for us

27:07.440 --> 27:08.920
to spend Christmas together."

27:11.160 --> 27:14.120
"My wish is for all of us to be together."

27:15.280 --> 27:16.440
"As a family,

27:17.680 --> 27:18.880
with the children."

27:20.280 --> 27:21.960
"Like other families."

27:23.920 --> 27:24.960
"I'd like for us

27:26.040 --> 27:27.360
to start anew."

27:30.320 --> 27:31.160
"Elvira."

27:38.880 --> 27:41.120
That's all of it?

27:41.640 --> 27:42.480
It is.

27:47.040 --> 27:47.960
Well, fuck me.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.560
That's just like her.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.400
That's it? There's no…

27:55.160 --> 27:57.720
no… apologies? Nothing?

27:59.160 --> 28:01.000
There's no…

28:01.080 --> 28:02.600
"Sorry I messed up your life"?

28:03.560 --> 28:05.920
"Sorry for disappearing on you for weeks"?

28:06.560 --> 28:08.520
"Sorry for fucking it all up"!

28:09.840 --> 28:11.000
For fuck's sake.

28:23.120 --> 28:23.960
Still…

28:26.200 --> 28:27.720
She's the mother of your kids.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.640
They should be together for Christmas.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.320
You could say yes.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.520
Just for one evening.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.600
I can't.

28:38.520 --> 28:42.120
I can't. It's like I have
something stuck right here.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.560
Like she lied to me from the start.

28:46.640 --> 28:50.040
Like she lied from the day we met.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.680
Lorenzo!

28:52.760 --> 28:53.880
Hi!

28:53.960 --> 28:56.080
Awesome.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.040
And you brought pizzas too.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.920
I'm sick of the twins' cooking.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.360
Let me set the table. I'm starving.

29:09.040 --> 29:09.880
Hey.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.200
Please, not a word of this to the kids.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.320
Of course not.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.200
Thank you.

29:20.440 --> 29:24.000
"I've understood some things,
yet I'm not getting better."

29:25.400 --> 29:28.120
"I make mistakes at work
and am unsatisfied."

29:43.800 --> 29:45.920
"It feels like everyone's out to hurt me."

30:04.400 --> 30:08.480
"I feel guilty.
I feel alone in my distress."

30:16.240 --> 30:17.960
Is there anything you want to say?

30:20.760 --> 30:22.720
It's a matter of mindset.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.640
Can you tell us?

30:34.880 --> 30:36.880
Anyone care to do it for Carole?

30:40.480 --> 30:43.800
She feels responsible
for her friend falling off a roof.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.160
-He's now a paraplegic.
-It is my fault.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.760
Maybe Carole is mad at her mother.

30:52.840 --> 30:53.960
For lying.

30:56.760 --> 30:57.760
Not at all.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.640
That's not it.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.160
This is complete bullshit.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.880
This is normal.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.160
The rebelling phase
is part of the process.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.000
Clemence.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.600
"As a child, I had too much sun."

31:25.080 --> 31:26.120
Yes, Clemence?

31:27.160 --> 31:28.440
I don't get it.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.880
What could this mean to you?

31:34.920 --> 31:36.480
Why was it sent to you?

31:38.360 --> 31:39.200
I don't know.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.680
I can see you're trying.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.480
But not hard enough.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.960
I asked you to sleep in separate beds,

31:50.040 --> 31:53.200
to start the identification phase,
leading to the purification.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.320
-Are you?
-We'll start tonight.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.680
-I'll tell her, then.
-What?

34:06.760 --> 34:08.800
We're not running a hotel.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.920
Mathieu, wait!

34:13.000 --> 34:14.560
Elvira, we have to talk.

34:25.680 --> 34:26.520
You all right?

34:37.720 --> 34:40.480
I didn't mean you had to leave tonight.

34:41.720 --> 34:43.680
Hold on.

34:48.560 --> 34:49.400
Take this.

34:50.240 --> 34:51.080
Thanks.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.840
I'M SORRY

36:58.760 --> 37:02.440
I'm sick of your empty promises, asshole!

37:02.520 --> 37:04.280
You just want to fuck me.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.480
Hello, Pierre.

37:46.760 --> 37:47.840
Hello, Mickaël.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.560
-Hassan, hi.
-Didn't she move away?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.400
Hi, Aurélie.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.280
-I thought she'd killed herself.
-Hi, Céline.

38:02.720 --> 38:03.560
Hello.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.840
-Can we help you?
-I'm looking for Channa.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.200
-Mrs. Diallo?
-Yes.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.000
-Do you have an appointment?
-I don't.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.360
I'm sorry, who are you?

38:22.920 --> 38:23.800
The Devil.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.520
That's what you all think, right?

38:27.600 --> 38:30.400
Well, I'm homeless and jobless.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.400
Happy, now?

38:32.040 --> 38:34.200
Have I paid enough for what I did?

38:35.720 --> 38:37.840
What about forgiveness, huh?

38:43.240 --> 38:44.240
Miss.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.200
Please follow me.

38:54.720 --> 38:55.560
Yes?

38:56.240 --> 38:58.960
Sorry for the intrusion.
Someone here's insisting to see you.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.080
Thanks. Hi.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.240
Elvira Giannini, back at Gépéma.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.000
Revisiting the crime scene, are you?

39:12.160 --> 39:13.800
Why are you looking at me like that?

39:14.360 --> 39:15.680
Do you want to buy me?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.240
No, I…

39:22.520 --> 39:23.480
I missed you.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.600
Now, what can I do for you?

39:29.000 --> 39:29.920
Hire me back.

39:30.520 --> 39:33.120
I can't. You were fired for misconduct.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.280
I need money.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.920
After everything… my family's in a rut.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.720
We can't find a way to reconnect.

39:40.800 --> 39:44.640
The only thing that could save us
would be a big family trip.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.160
Far from this sad, gray place.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.120
It would be a new beginning.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.520
So I need to work. Please.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.800
Elvira, I wish I could take you back.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.920
Brunet was right, they all suck.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.720
But HQ's been breathing down our necks.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.760
They're always threatening
to shut us down.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.480
I need them to know you're here
like I need a bullet in the head.

40:07.560 --> 40:08.560
You understand?

40:11.320 --> 40:12.400
I'm sorry.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.600
Patrick.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.520
No.

40:53.600 --> 40:54.520
I'm sorry.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.040
Hello.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.400
Congratulations.

41:06.120 --> 41:07.040
Thanks.

41:09.520 --> 41:13.280
PHARMACY

41:40.000 --> 41:40.840
Hi.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.480
I'm here for my dish.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.240
You haven't washed it, of course.

41:57.800 --> 42:01.280
Look, I'm sorry for the other night.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.560
You know what teenagers are like.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.200
Actually, I don't.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.280
I can't have children, remember?

42:09.120 --> 42:12.160
I mean… they just don't get it.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.760
They're a bit lost.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.080
But your help has been a real blessing.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.480
I want you so bad.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.040
You do?

42:26.600 --> 42:28.760
I do. I want to kiss you.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.840
It's pretty obvious.

42:32.200 --> 42:33.360
Even the kids noticed.

42:33.440 --> 42:36.080
I'm really sorry, but,

42:36.880 --> 42:38.440
I'm not too sure.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.480
I'm sorry.

42:41.160 --> 42:44.360
It's not you, it's me. I'm not…

42:44.440 --> 42:47.640
My dental hygiene is
not what it was, right now.

42:47.720 --> 42:50.480
I don't feel too good, to be honest.

42:51.520 --> 42:52.720
Because of the pharmacist?

42:53.600 --> 42:55.680
Who? Brigitte?

42:55.760 --> 42:57.440
No, it's not.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.240
Although, maybe a little bit.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.720
Since I've stopped seeing her,
I no longer have my meds.

43:03.800 --> 43:06.040
Or my vitamins. That's why I'm sluggish.

43:06.920 --> 43:09.600
But it's for the best. I was abusing them.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.080
With Elvira and everything.

43:21.200 --> 43:22.160
Wait.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.480
Here's the deal.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.560
How about we take it slow?

43:31.600 --> 43:32.440
Okay.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.520
-See you.
-Yeah.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.160
Hello?

44:31.760 --> 44:33.240
A little help, please?

44:38.200 --> 44:39.120
Lorenzo!

44:40.840 --> 44:41.680
There you go.

44:42.960 --> 44:43.800
There.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.640
Don't put it there.

44:50.040 --> 44:50.880
No!

44:51.840 --> 44:53.760
Will you wear these?

44:53.840 --> 44:55.440
-Will you?
-Okay.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.680
You want both pairs?

44:58.280 --> 44:59.280
Thanks.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.320
Sorry.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.320
Should we put something here?

45:19.520 --> 45:20.360
Here.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.680
I'm giving you my body, my heart,

45:25.360 --> 45:26.880
and my life, wrapped into one.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.360
Good evening.

46:01.160 --> 46:04.720
I'd like… whiskey, please.

46:04.800 --> 46:05.760
Whiskey.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.120
<i>Hi, this is Isa.</i>

46:19.200 --> 46:21.600
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

46:22.320 --> 46:23.960
Hi Isa, it's me. Elvira.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.240
Look,

46:27.760 --> 46:33.040
I know we… we haven't spoken in a while.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.320
But… I don't know.

46:37.720 --> 46:38.560
I'm…

46:39.960 --> 46:42.280
I have nowhere to sleep. There.

46:45.680 --> 46:49.440
I'm sorry, I have trouble speaking.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.480
I'm sending you love.
Say hi to Jeff for me.

46:58.920 --> 46:59.840
I could help out.

47:02.120 --> 47:04.040
-I have a sofa bed.
-Mr. Brunet?

47:05.240 --> 47:06.960
You scared me.

47:09.280 --> 47:10.960
Have you noticed?

47:11.040 --> 47:13.560
The places you least want to go are always

47:13.640 --> 47:15.200
the ones you have the most fun.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.080
But when you're expecting

47:18.160 --> 47:19.800
a great night of fun,

47:19.880 --> 47:21.960
you often end up bored out of your skull.

47:23.720 --> 47:26.760
Be open to the unexpected, Elvira.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.880
Elvira, listen.

47:50.960 --> 47:54.400
I'm only offering you shelter
out of politeness.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.320
Nothing's going to happen between us.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.240
You don't say?

48:03.800 --> 48:06.080
I don't find you attractive, at all.

48:06.800 --> 48:07.720
Is that clear?

48:09.480 --> 48:10.600
I'll get fresh sheets.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.880
You are not,

48:17.960 --> 48:19.880
absolutely not, my type.

48:30.200 --> 48:31.280
Good night.

48:31.880 --> 48:32.720
Good night.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.920
