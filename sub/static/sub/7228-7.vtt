[Doc reading]

00:59.559 --> 01:02.395
Huggy Monkeys!
You'll never tag me!

01:02.854 --> 01:05.022
[both] Oh, yes, we will!

01:05.105 --> 01:08.943
Only one of the Huggy Monkeys
has to tag her.
So, let's split up.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.864
Okay, I'll go left,
you go right!

01:13.406 --> 01:14.908

01:25.710 --> 01:26.878
Oh, no!

01:29.964 --> 01:30.799
Hmm...

01:33.009 --> 01:36.137
Monkey Tag! Donny!
Donny, we got her!

01:36.221 --> 01:37.639
[laughs] You totally did.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.516
Time out! Time out!

01:41.059 --> 01:44.312
I ripped Ben.
I'm sorry, Alma.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.191
Well, it doesn't
look too bad.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.193
As long as they can
still hug, right?

01:55.949 --> 02:00.620
[gasps] Oh, no!
What good are Huggy Monkeys
if they can't hug?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.084
Alma, I'm pretty good
at fixing toys.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.794
Why don't I take a look
at Ben in the clinic?

02:08.877 --> 02:09.711
Thanks, Doc.

02:10.295 --> 02:11.256
Wait!

02:11.339 --> 02:13.091
Ben wouldn't want
to be without Anna.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.135
So, take both of them, okay?

02:15.343 --> 02:16.845
Good thinking, Alma.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.558
[door opens]

02:21.766 --> 02:23.184
The Doc is in!

02:28.523 --> 02:30.942
[all giggling]

02:31.818 --> 02:33.611
Hi, everyone!
[all] Hi!

02:34.028 --> 02:35.530
And who do we have here?

02:35.822 --> 02:36.823
I'm Ben.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.158
And I'm Anna.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.325
Together we're...

02:39.409 --> 02:41.161
[both] The Huggy Monkeys!

02:41.452 --> 02:43.121
[both chattering]

02:50.253 --> 02:51.296
[both grunt]

02:52.380 --> 02:54.841
Ben? A little
huggier, please.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.594
Um, that's as huggy
as I can get.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.971
Ben, your paw is ripped,

03:00.054 --> 03:02.473
so you can't hug the way
you usually do.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.810
[voice breaking]
But, Ben's my
hugging partner.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.479
Happy to step in
while Ben's injured.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.607
Whoa!

03:11.149 --> 03:12.150
[groans]

03:12.233 --> 03:14.652
Doc, you'd better fix Ben.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.823
Can you help, Doc?
I mean, hugging is what
we live for!

03:18.907 --> 03:21.659
We're world-famous
for our hugging skills.

03:21.993 --> 03:25.204
Oh, is it true
you once hugged
for 14 days straight?

03:25.622 --> 03:27.540
Sure did! Couldn't have
done it with anyone

03:27.624 --> 03:29.876
but my little
Anna-banana here.

03:31.002 --> 03:34.422
But now I guess
our hugging days are over.

03:34.505 --> 03:38.635
Not if I can help it.
Come on, let's get you in
for a checkup.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.015
Can I see your paw, Ben?

03:48.478 --> 03:50.355
I knew hugging
was dangerous!

03:50.438 --> 03:52.941
Chilly,
hugging's not dangerous!

03:53.274 --> 03:56.569
Ooh, good.
'Cause I think I need
a hug right about now.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.821
-Aww...
-Ooh! Nice one.

03:59.447 --> 04:02.575
It was. But I miss Ben.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.661
I have a diagnosis!

04:04.744 --> 04:08.623
Ben,
your huggy patch is ripped.
You have Huggy-patch-otis!

04:08.706 --> 04:11.709
Let's record this in
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos!</span>

04:12.418 --> 04:13.419
Great idea!

04:14.254 --> 04:17.507
I don't know what I'll do
if I can't hug Anna anymore.

04:18.048 --> 04:20.218
Don't worry.
You're going to
hug her again.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.594
I promise!

04:22.387 --> 04:24.597
I'm going to paste
your paw patch back on.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.808
The paste might
be a little cold,

04:27.225 --> 04:28.393
but it won't hurt.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.813
[giggles] That tickles!

04:34.065 --> 04:36.317
There! Your patch is back on.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.860
[chatters]

04:37.944 --> 04:39.779
I can't wait to try it out!

04:40.738 --> 04:42.740
Hang on, Ben.
The paste isn't--

04:42.824 --> 04:43.825
[Anna gasps] Oh!

04:44.158 --> 04:44.993
dry yet!

04:45.243 --> 04:46.494
My huggy patch!

04:46.577 --> 04:47.745
Oh, Ben!

04:48.204 --> 04:50.540
Anna, I love hugging you,

04:50.623 --> 04:54.127
but I think you'd better
find a new huggy partner.

04:54.419 --> 04:58.464
No, Ben. Without you,
I'll never hug again!

04:58.548 --> 05:00.383
We were made to go together.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.344
See? It says so right here.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.264
I'm not going to let
anything stop the hugs.

05:07.807 --> 05:11.185
Ben, I'm going to paste
this patch on again.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.274
Wrap it up.

05:17.942 --> 05:21.779
And then, I think
we should check you into
the clinic for the night.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.489
Ooh, great!

05:23.573 --> 05:26.034
Wait! Did you say
I had to stay here?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.952
Overnight?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.787
I know it seems scary,

05:29.996 --> 05:33.458
but sometimes
it's good to be near
your doctors and nurses

05:33.541 --> 05:34.751
in case you need help.

05:35.209 --> 05:39.881
I had a bad fever once,
and I had to stay in
the hospital overnight.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.759
You did? Were you scared?

05:43.009 --> 05:47.346
A little at first
but they took really
good care of me.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.098
I was home
before I knew it!

05:49.432 --> 05:53.019
Well, if you
think I should, Doc,
I guess I'll stay.

05:53.352 --> 05:56.105
Oh, what a brave
little patient!

05:56.189 --> 05:57.857
I'll check you in
for the night.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.192
What's that?

06:01.486 --> 06:03.112
Hey, it's me!

06:03.404 --> 06:04.864
It sure is, Sugar!

06:04.947 --> 06:08.618
You wear a wristband
when you're staying overnight
in the hospital.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.912
It has all your
information on it.

06:10.995 --> 06:15.500
See? "Ben Monkey.
Needs frequent hugs."

06:15.958 --> 06:17.460
Thanks, Hallie! I love it.

06:17.794 --> 06:22.048
Good! Now, let's
make up a comfy bed
for our little monkey.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.220
Mmm!

06:29.889 --> 06:31.099
[Stuffy] Whoops!
Ooh!

06:31.432 --> 06:32.683
Mmm-mmm! Mmm!

06:32.767 --> 06:33.643
That won't do.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.729
This bed is lumpier
than a lima bean lollipop!

06:36.938 --> 06:37.814
Medic!

06:38.523 --> 06:41.526
Just, keep your arm up.
It'll heal better.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.736
But my arm's getting tired.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.029
I bet!

06:45.113 --> 06:48.116
Hallie, we're going to need
to help Ben hold up his arm.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.992
Way ahead of you, Doc!

06:59.669 --> 07:00.837
[chatters]

07:00.920 --> 07:02.922
That feels much better!

07:03.297 --> 07:04.549
Great, you're all set.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.717
I'll stay
till you get settled,

07:06.801 --> 07:08.719
and then I'll check in
on you later.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.846
Any questions?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.807
Um... Doc,
I have a question.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.059
Where do I stay?

07:15.518 --> 07:16.769
I'm sorry, Anna.

07:17.061 --> 07:20.148
You can't stay with Ben.
He needs his rest,

07:20.398 --> 07:22.942
so visiting hours
will be over soon.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.988
Tell you what,
you can come sleep
with me in my room.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.158
But I don't want to leave
my brother alone!

07:30.491 --> 07:34.203
He won't be alone.
Hallie will stay
with him all night!

07:34.620 --> 07:38.458
Don't worry, Anna.
I'm going to be okay.

You've had a long day.

story now, honey?

If Hallie hasn't called,
Ben is fine.

I know.
It's just, I miss him.

We've never
been apart before.

Ben's paw is better?

11:17.676 --> 11:19.678
Let's take a look!

11:25.518 --> 11:27.395
That hug patch is dry, Ben.

Rudi?

12:52.980 --> 12:54.565
Does he do any tricks?

12:54.899 --> 12:57.860
Not really.
But he chases stuff.

This must be quicksand!

Don't cry, sugar.
We'll find him.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.835
Right! We never
leave a man behind,

16:02.294 --> 16:03.420

Where are you?
[Chilly] Oh, Hermie!

that clickety-clack

Wait. What was
that last one?

No, no. Before that.

Come on, everybody! Dig!

17:00.227 --> 17:01.478
[gasps] Hermie!

17:03.772 --> 17:06.775
Heh, thanks, guys.
I was wicked scared there

17:06.858 --> 17:08.444
that you'd never find me.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.571
Are you okay, Hermie?
We were so worried about you.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.532
Nah, I'm good.
I got a tough shell.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.785
I'm glad you're okay.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.244
Let's go.

17:20.705 --> 17:21.707
Um...

17:21.790 --> 17:23.876
I think
you forgot something.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.712
What're you talking about?

17:31.175 --> 17:34.553
Ooh! Ouch.
That looks wicked bad.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.556
Don't worry, Hermie.
Doc can fix it.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.391
She can fix anything.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.269
She'll be a superstar
in my book if she does.

17:42.811 --> 17:43.854
'Cause, face it,

17:43.937 --> 17:46.607
I'm half the crab
I used to be.

17:47.274 --> 17:51.528
Let's get you
to the clinic, stat,
so we can reattach that claw.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.155
[panting]

17:55.449 --> 17:57.076
I have a diagnosis!

17:57.618 --> 18:00.037
You have Claw-be-gone-itis.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.709
That's good enough for
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos!</span>

18:06.043 --> 18:08.378
Oh, that sounds really bad.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.840
Is it bad?
You can tell me.
I can take it.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.842
Will I ever be able to...

18:13.926 --> 18:14.927
[Doc] All done.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.428
Get out!

18:16.970 --> 18:18.889
That was easy.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.892
What can we say.
Doc's good.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.602
Thanks, Hallie.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.604
Now let's do
a little checkup

is working okay.

Oh!

19:08.689 --> 19:09.731

19:10.357 --> 19:11.984
Huh. That's strange.

What's wrong, Hermie?

19:14.903 --> 19:16.530
Uh, I don't mean
to be crabby,

19:16.613 --> 19:19.199
but I don't think my arm
is working too good.

Can you hold
this cotton ball?

19:24.371 --> 19:28.208
Can't do it!
Not strong enough!

Hmm...

Try pinching this
pencil with your claw.

that's a problem!

What are you
going to do, Doc?

Hallie, I need my charts,
and I'll be right back.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.150
Hi, Mom. Are you busy?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.944
I always have time for you,
Sweetpea. What's up?

19:56.361 --> 19:57.905
I've got a tough case,

19:57.988 --> 20:00.073
and I think I need
a second opinion.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.992
Ooh, sounds serious.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.619
Tell me about your case.

20:04.244 --> 20:08.207
You can see that I reattached
the patient's claw here.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.959
Looks exactly like what
I would have done.

20:11.210 --> 20:15.464
Yeah, but now the claw
isn't as strong
as it used to be.

20:15.839 --> 20:16.840
Hmm...

20:17.132 --> 20:20.010
It sounds like your patient
needs some physical therapy.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.970
That sounds good.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.014
What is it, exactly?

20:24.473 --> 20:25.474
[chuckles]

20:25.557 --> 20:28.518
In this case,
physical therapy is exercise

20:28.602 --> 20:31.021
for the part of the patient
that you helped fix.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.815
So, if you give his arm
some exercises...

20:33.899 --> 20:35.192
He'll get strong again!

20:35.567 --> 20:37.027
[chuckles] You got it.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.654
Thanks, Mom!

And you know,
if you ever need
a second opinion...

21:00.550 --> 21:03.428
That sounds okay,
but I think I'd rather
have the ice cream.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.640
Hermie's physical therapy
is like exercises

21:06.723 --> 21:08.892
to get his claw strong
and feeling good again.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.478
Yeah! Sounds perfect, Doc.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.981
And I'd clap
if my arm was stronger.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.941
You'll be clapping
soon enough, Hermie.

22:00.569 --> 22:04.906
Wow!
My arm feels strong again.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.160
[Stuffy] Whoa!

22:08.618 --> 22:10.037
Impressive.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.539
[straining]

22:13.415 --> 22:16.126
Guess I don't know
my own strength.

[grunting]

22:19.713 --> 22:20.589
Me neither!

22:21.965 --> 22:24.593
It's good to see your arm
is back to normal, Hermie.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.511
And I owe it all to you,

22:26.595 --> 22:28.013
and to physical therapy.

22:28.597 --> 22:32.726
You have to keep
doing physical therapy
for a week or so.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.644
You got it, Doc.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.938
[Emmie] Doc?
Did you find Hermie?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.940
Yeah, Emmie, I'm in here!

22:39.316 --> 22:40.817
Toys! Go stuffed!

22:41.026 --> 22:42.027
[grunting]

22:42.110 --> 22:44.446
Just give me a sec. I can...

22:46.698 --> 22:47.699
There!

22:48.158 --> 22:49.409
I could have done that.

22:50.786 --> 22:51.828
[Rudi barking]

22:52.287 --> 22:54.748
[Emmie] No, Rudi! Come back!

22:55.499 --> 22:56.333
Rudi!

22:58.502 --> 22:59.920
I got this, Doc.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.172

23:12.015 --> 23:13.558
[blows] Yeah!

23:13.850 --> 23:15.060
[Emmie] There you are.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.479
Sorry about Rudi, Doc.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.940
That's okay, Emmie.
I found Hermie,

23:20.023 --> 23:25.112
and I don't think
Rudi's going to be
bothering him anymore.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.531
Hi, cutie Rudi!

23:27.614 --> 23:28.657

23:28.740 --> 23:30.909
Rudi, you are so cute!
I love you, Rudi!

Hey, everybody,
it's Doc here.

<span style="style.default_1">what should you do?</span>

23:39.960 --> 23:42.379
<span style="style.default_1">Should you have a tea party?</span>

23:42.462 --> 23:43.964
[slurps]

23:44.422 --> 23:46.133
<span style="style.default_1">Take a nap and recharge?</span>

23:48.260 --> 23:49.678

[grunts]

23:52.430 --> 23:54.349
<span style="style.default_1">That's right.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You should take a nap.</span>

23:56.017 --> 23:59.354
<span style="style.default_1">After you do,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you can zoom into action.</span>
