11:47.208 --> 11:50.083
- I'M STILL--
- THE OLD FACE.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.166
NO, SET IT UP
FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.875
- FINE.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.000
[phone ringing]

11:58.000 --> 12:01.500
- WHY THE FUCK WOULD I
LEAD A PRESS CONFERENCE?

12:01.500 --> 12:02.875
ISN'T THAT YOUR THING?

12:02.875 --> 12:05.000
- UH, USUALLY, YES,

12:05.000 --> 12:06.333
BUT I MADE
A STRATEGIC DECISION

12:06.333 --> 12:07.542
TO PUT YOU
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.208
YOU'LL GIVE THE PUBLIC
THE IMPRESSION

12:09.208 --> 12:10.583
THAT THE SITUATION'S
LESS CRITICAL.

12:10.583 --> 12:14.041
BESIDES, DEALING WITH THE PRESS
IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

12:14.041 --> 12:16.041
AS LIEUTENANT.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.500
- I THOUGHT MY RESPONSIBILITY

12:17.500 --> 12:18.875
WAS CATCHING THE HORSE FUCKER
THAT'S KILLING PEOPLE.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.041
- YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN
TO MULTITASK.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.375
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

12:22.375 --> 12:25.333
YOU STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED
YOUR FIT FOR DUTY THERAPY.

12:25.333 --> 12:26.625
THE SHOOTING
WAS OVER TWO WEEKS AGO.

12:26.625 --> 12:28.291
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND TIME
TO GO TO A THERAPIST?

12:28.291 --> 12:30.375
- FIGURE IT OUT.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.041
YOU'RE A LIABILITY
UNTIL YOU GET CLEARED.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.417
- FUCKING NIGHTMARE.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.083
- YOU OKAY?

12:45.083 --> 12:48.500
- OBVIOUSLY.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.542
- YOU'LL BE FINE.

12:50.542 --> 12:53.250
JUST--
HEY, NEVER MIND.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.333
NOT MY PLACE.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.917
- WHAT? TELL ME.

12:57.917 --> 13:01.291
- YOU JUST MIGHT WANT TO...

13:01.291 --> 13:05.083
DRESS A LITTLE MORE...
PROFESSIONAL.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.250
LIKE A LIEUTENANT.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.959
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, UH,
SKIRT SUIT, HEELS.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.000
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE WAY I DRESS?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.250
- I MEAN, YOU KIND OF
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE--

13:14.250 --> 13:16.750
- WHAT?
A DETECTIVE?

13:16.750 --> 13:19.166
- NO, LIKE YOU'RE
GOING TO A HOEDOWN.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.625
- WHERE SHOULD I PUT
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S REPORT

13:25.625 --> 13:26.667
FOR THE FOUR HORSEMEN'S CASE?

13:26.667 --> 13:28.500
- UH, WHEREVER.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.458
UH, YOU BUSY LATER?

13:29.458 --> 13:31.750
THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE
OUR SECOND DATE.

13:31.750 --> 13:34.125
- SURE, I HAVE ROLLER DERBY
PRACTICE UNTIL 9:00,

13:34.125 --> 13:35.500
BUT WE CAN TOTALLY HANG AFTER.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.959
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU'RE A--

13:36.959 --> 13:37.917
YOU'RE A DERBY GIRL?

13:37.917 --> 13:39.625
- GOT THE BRUISES
TO PROVE IT.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.458
- I THINK MY HEAD
JUST EXPLODED.

13:41.458 --> 13:44.625
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:44.625 --> 13:47.458
WHY DON'T WE HAVE
OUR SECOND DATE RIGHT NOW?

13:47.458 --> 13:49.000
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.166
LITTLE MAKE OUT SESSION
IN THE WOMEN'S BATHROOM?

13:51.166 --> 13:53.542
- I WAS THINKING
SOME SHOW AND TELL

13:53.542 --> 13:55.083
IN THE EVIDENCE ROOM?

13:55.083 --> 13:56.500
- EVEN BETTER.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.041
- NOT THE DIRTY KIND.

13:59.041 --> 14:02.083
YOU KNOW, SHOWING ME
THE ICE TRUCK KILLER STUFF

14:02.083 --> 14:03.458
WAS SO COOL.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.834
I WAS JUST THINKING MAYBE YOU
COULD SHOW ME THE TRINITY STUFF

14:05.834 --> 14:07.291
OR THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER
EVIDENCE.

14:07.291 --> 14:08.667
- I CAN'T.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.208
THE FBI HAS ALL THOSE FILES.

14:10.208 --> 14:13.166
BUT, UM, I PROMISE
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU LATER.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.500
- YOU BETTER.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.917
NOW OPEN THE M.E.'s REPORT.

14:16.917 --> 14:19.291
I'M DYING TO KNOW
WHAT IT SAYS.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.375
- WHEN BRIAN SENT MESSAGES,

14:26.375 --> 14:28.500
THEY WERE TAILOR-MADE FOR ME.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.041
BUT I SHOULD STILL BE ABLE
TO CRACK THIS GUY'S CODE.

14:32.709 --> 14:33.709
- ALL RIGHT.
- READY?

14:33.709 --> 14:35.250
- OKAY.
LET'S DO THIS.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.000
- MOST OF YOU HAVE ALREADY MET
DETECTIVE MIKE ANDERSON.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.208
HE'S WORKING ON A THEORY

14:39.208 --> 14:40.750
THAT OUR KILLER
IS REENACTING SCENES

14:40.750 --> 14:41.750
FROM THE BOOK OF REVELATION.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.041
- THERE'S A LOT
OF BRUTAL IMAGERY HERE,

14:44.041 --> 14:46.166
AND OUR KILLER HAD
A LOT TO CHOOSE FROM.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.959
- I JUST THE M.E. REPORT
FROM THE FOUR HORSEMEN VIC.

14:47.959 --> 14:48.959
AND GUESS WHAT IT SAYS?

14:48.959 --> 14:49.875
- MUST BE PRETTY IMPORTANT

14:49.875 --> 14:51.166
FOR YOU TO BUST IN HERE
LIKE THIS.

14:51.166 --> 14:52.750
- UH, HE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A DRAMA QUEEN.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.166
- THERE WERE TRACES OF
OXIDIZED IRON IN THE KILL WOUND.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.375
RUST.

14:56.375 --> 14:58.000
I MEAN, NOBODY'S USED
IRON TO MAKE WEAPONS

14:58.000 --> 14:59.375
SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES,

14:59.375 --> 15:02.709
WHICH MEANS OUR KILLER COULD
HAVE USED A ANCIENT ARTIFACT.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.250
- WHAT KIND OF ARTIFACT?

15:04.250 --> 15:05.458
- I'M NOT SURE YET.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.959
BUT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WOUND
SUGGEST A SWORD.

15:07.959 --> 15:10.375
UM, BUT THERE ARE HUNDREDS
OF VARIETIES OF SWORDS.

15:10.375 --> 15:11.583
- GREAT. STAY ON THAT.

15:11.583 --> 15:12.792
MIKE, YOU WERE SAYING?

15:12.792 --> 15:15.041
- SO FAR OUR KILLER
HAS GIVEN US THREE TABLEAUS.

15:15.041 --> 15:17.750
THE INTESTINES ON THE SCALE,
THE SNAKES VICTIM,

15:17.750 --> 15:18.917
AND THE FOUR HORSEMEN.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.625
- I'M SORRY.
UH, TABLEAUS?

15:21.625 --> 15:23.250
- IT'S A THEATRICAL TERM

15:23.250 --> 15:25.542
REFERRING TO A PICTURESQUE
GROUPING OF PEOPLE OR OBJECTS.

15:25.542 --> 15:26.667
- OH, ALL THIS TIME

15:26.667 --> 15:28.208
I JUST THOUGHT
THEY WERE CALLED CRIME SCENES.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.875
- NO, IT'S MORE
THAN JUST A CRIME SCENE.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.417
EVERYTHING HE'S SHOWING US
HAS MEANING.

15:31.417 --> 15:32.917
FROM THE POSITIONING
OF THE BODIES

15:32.917 --> 15:35.250
TO THE CLOTHES
HE PUTS ON HIS VICTIMS,

15:35.250 --> 15:36.417
NOTHING'S BY ACCIDENT.

15:36.417 --> 15:37.583
- EXACTLY.

15:37.583 --> 15:38.875
- HE'S COMMUNICATING WITH US.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.959
MIKE'S JUST HELPING
WITH THE TRANSLATION.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.375
- THE FOUR HORSEMEN
OF THE APOCALYPSE

15:42.375 --> 15:44.667
ARE DESCRIBED
IN REVELATION  6,

15:44.667 --> 15:46.417
VERSES ONE THROUGH EIGHT.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.458
AS FOR THE SEVEN SNAKES MURDER,

15:48.458 --> 15:50.041
REVELATION  13.

15:50.041 --> 15:52.375
"AND I STOOD UPON
THE SAND OF THE SEA

15:52.375 --> 15:54.583
"AND SAW A SERPENT
RISE OUT OF THE SEA,

15:54.583 --> 15:57.250
HAVING SEVEN HEADS."

15:57.250 --> 15:58.917
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THE INTESTINES?

15:58.917 --> 16:01.709
- THERE'S NO PASSAGE
ON INTESTINES,

16:01.709 --> 16:04.125
BUT THE SCALES OF JUSTICE
ARE ALL OVER THE BIBLE.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.625
I FIGURE HE'S REFERENCING
GOD'S JUDGMENT OF MANKIND.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.125
- WHAT ABOUT THE NUMBERS
WE FOUND ON THE BODY?

16:08.125 --> 16:09.875
1237 AND 1242.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.166
- DON'T KNOW.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.166
BUT I CAN GET IN TOUCH
WITH A REVELATION  EXPERT

16:13.166 --> 16:16.333
WHO MIGHT BE ABLE
TO TELL US MORE.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.625
- THEY HAPPENED
FIVE DAYS APART.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.667
THE TWO MURDERS HAPPENED
FIVE DAYS APART.

16:21.667 --> 16:24.458
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
1237 AND 1242 IS FIVE.

16:24.458 --> 16:25.959
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T SEE IT BEFORE.

16:25.959 --> 16:27.875
- SO THE NUMBERS ARE DAYS.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.250
HE'S COUNTING UP TO SOMETHING.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.959
- TO WHAT?
- DON'T KNOW.

16:30.959 --> 16:33.208
BUT IF ALL THIS
REVELATION  STUFF

16:33.208 --> 16:35.291
HAS TO DO WITH DOOMSDAY,

16:35.291 --> 16:37.375
MAYBE IT'S TO THE END
OF THE WORLD.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.583
- OKAY.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.083
SO WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A RELIGIOUS NUTBAG.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.500
QUINN, BATISTA,
ROUND UP ANY END-TIMES FANATICS

16:43.500 --> 16:45.375
THAT MIGHT HAVE
CRIMINAL RECORDS.

16:45.375 --> 16:48.000
LET'S FIND THIS...
DOOMSDAY KILLER.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.333
- IT'S HAPPENING, TRAVIS.

17:02.333 --> 17:04.667
LOOK AROUND US.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.333
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.834
SOON YOU'LL START
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE--

17:16.166 --> 17:19.041
TRAVIS...
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

17:19.041 --> 17:21.667
- YES.
THEY'RE AFRAID.

17:21.667 --> 17:24.875
- OKAY, I GOT IT.
SHE'S PRETTY.

17:24.875 --> 17:25.959
- WHO?

17:25.959 --> 17:26.875
- THE WAITRESS.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.083
YOU'VE BEEN STARING AT HER.

17:29.083 --> 17:33.875
BUT WE REALLY HAVE
TO STAY FOCUSED.

17:33.875 --> 17:37.458
- SO YOU DON'T THINK
I SHOULD ASK HER OUT?

17:37.458 --> 17:38.458
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

17:38.458 --> 17:41.542
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE.

17:41.542 --> 17:42.583
I THINK SHE LIKES ME.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.875
- HEY, TRAV.
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

17:44.875 --> 17:49.125
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

17:49.125 --> 17:51.375
- THANK YOU.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.834
- I THOUGHT RELIGION
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE COMFORTING.

17:57.834 --> 18:00.208
BUT SWARMS OF LOCUSTS,
BOWLS OF WRATH?

18:00.208 --> 18:03.375
WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT
TO BELIEVE THIS STUFF?

18:06.583 --> 18:08.500
- BE HONEST.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.125
PROFESSIONAL OR STUPID?

18:10.125 --> 18:11.625
- PROFESSIONAL.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.333
- HA.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.291
- BUT YOU DON'T LOOK
MUCH LIKE YOU.

18:15.291 --> 18:17.417
- [chuckles]

18:17.417 --> 18:19.458
YOU WANT TO TELL ME HOW
I'M SUPPOSED TO CATCH DOOMSDAY

18:19.458 --> 18:22.625
IF I'M SPENDING ALL MY TIME
WRITING PRESS STATEMENTS,

18:22.625 --> 18:24.583
GOING TO
COURT-ORDERED THERAPY,

18:24.583 --> 18:26.750
AND SHOPPING
FOR UGLY-ASS CLOTHES?

18:26.750 --> 18:28.750
- YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
YOU ALWAYS DO.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.917
- QUINN USED TO SAY THAT
WHEN I WAS IN MELTDOWN MODE.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.000
- HE SAW YOU IN MELTDOWN MODE

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
AND HE STILL WANTED
TO MARRY YOU?

18:34.000 --> 18:36.542
- POOP EXPLOSION.
- HARRISON?

18:36.542 --> 18:38.458
- IF IT'S JAMIE,
YOU'VE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.375
- KEEP AN EYE ON HIM WHILE
I'M DOWN IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM?

18:40.375 --> 18:41.917
- HIS TUMMY STILL UPSET?

18:41.917 --> 18:43.125
- YEAH,
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A BUG,

18:43.125 --> 18:44.458
BUT I CAN TAKE HIM
TO THE DOCTOR TOMORROW.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.333
- WHEW.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.792
- HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LITTLE MAN?

18:48.792 --> 18:51.542
YOU DON'T FEEL SO GOOD?

18:51.542 --> 18:53.458
- [whimpers]

18:53.458 --> 18:57.291
- WISH I COULD MAKE IT
ALL BETTER.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.875
I GUESS
THERE ARE SOME THINGS

19:02.875 --> 19:05.125
EVEN DADDIES CAN'T FIX.

19:18.041 --> 19:21.125
- SO I GAVE YOU
THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY RATE,

19:21.125 --> 19:23.583
AND I CAN HAVE THAT
TO YOU ASAP.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.709
- THANKS.
THE SOONER THE BETTER.

19:25.709 --> 19:28.000
- I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW
I'M TAKING OFF, ALL RIGHT?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.750
- ALL RIGHT.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.625
- DEX, WHAT'S UP?

19:31.625 --> 19:32.792
- 'SUP?

19:32.792 --> 19:34.125
- SO YOU HEADED OFF TO CLASS?

19:34.125 --> 19:35.875
- HEY, SAM'S SENDING ME
TO COMPUTER CLASS.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.500
GONNA BUILD HIM
A BOMB WEBSITE, YO.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.583
- YEAH, YOU BETTER.

19:38.583 --> 19:39.750
- ALL RIGHT.
LATERS.

19:39.750 --> 19:40.750
- BE SAFE. LATER.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.000
- SEE YOU, NICK.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.291
YOU REALLY TAKE CARE
OF THESE GUYS.

19:44.291 --> 19:47.000
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
GOD'S TAKING CARE OF ALL OF US.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.125
HERE GO YOUR ESTIMATE.
AGAIN.

19:57.208 --> 19:58.583
- ARE THESE YOUR NOTES?

19:58.583 --> 20:00.959
- YEAH. MM-HMM.

20:00.959 --> 20:03.625
EVERY TIME I READ IT,
I'M FINDING SOMETHING NEW.

20:03.625 --> 20:04.834
YOU EVER READ IT?

20:04.834 --> 20:08.000
- YEAH, I JUST STARTED.
FOR WORK.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.041
WE'RE TRACKING THIS KILLER.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.583
WE THINK
HE'S REENACTING SCENES

20:11.583 --> 20:14.291
FROM THE BOOK OF REVELATION.

20:14.291 --> 20:18.917
- THAT FOUR HORSEMEN CASE
FROM THE NEWS, YEAH?

20:18.917 --> 20:21.875
LORD HAVE MERCY.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.375
SAYING IT'S IN THE NAME
OF GOD--

20:24.375 --> 20:26.792
THE DEVIL IS BUSY.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.917
- YOU THINK HE'S USING GOD
AS AN EXCUSE TO KILL?

20:29.917 --> 20:32.458
- PEOPLE USE GOD AS AN EXCUSE
FOR A LOT OF THINGS.

20:32.458 --> 20:36.500
JUST BECAUSE HE BELIEVES
IN SOME CRAZY BULLSHIT,

20:36.500 --> 20:40.458
THAT DON'T MEAN HIS FAITH
IS ANY LESS REAL.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.959
- BUT IF FAITH MAKES PEOPLE
DO SUCH CRAZY BULLSHIT,

20:42.959 --> 20:44.875
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HAVING IT?

20:44.875 --> 20:47.542
- IT'S HUMAN NATURE.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.500
GOTTA BELIEVE IN SOMETHING.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.417
RIGHT?

20:51.417 --> 20:55.250
I MEAN, HAVEN'T YOU EVER
HAD A PROBLEM SO BIG

20:55.250 --> 20:56.834

31:07.834 --> 31:10.333
THE, UM--
THE PREACHER.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.750
- RIGHT. AWESOME.

31:12.750 --> 31:13.709
- WHERE'S MY HAT?

31:13.709 --> 31:14.959
- ♪ SPILL THE WINE ♪

31:14.959 --> 31:17.041
♪ DIG THAT GIRL ♪

31:17.041 --> 31:18.333
- DID YOU KNOW THAT CHILDREN

31:18.333 --> 31:20.792
WHO UNDERGO ANESTHESIA
UNDER THE AGE OF THREE

31:20.792 --> 31:22.834
ARE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP
LEARNING DISABILITIES?

31:22.834 --> 31:25.083
- ARE YOU DOING RESEARCH?

31:25.083 --> 31:27.083
- AND ONCE THE APPENDIX BURSTS,

31:27.083 --> 31:30.792
THE COMPLICATION RATE
RISES TO 59%.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.875
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET OFF THE INTERNET.

31:36.959 --> 31:38.750
YOU THINK WE SHOULD
CALL ASTOR AND CODY,

31:38.750 --> 31:41.959
LET THEM KNOW
HARRISON'S IN SURGERY?

31:41.959 --> 31:44.125
- NO, NOT YET.
I DON'T WANT TO WORRY THEM.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.875
- UH, DEB,
IS THAT YOU ON TV?

31:46.875 --> 31:48.667
- ...POLITICS
OR PUBLIC OPINION.

31:48.667 --> 31:51.041
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS CATCHING
THE [bleep] THAT DID THIS.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.917
OH, FUCK.

31:52.917 --> 31:54.041
- [sighs]

31:54.041 --> 31:56.500
- SORRY.

32:00.417 --> 32:01.583
- DEXTER?

32:01.583 --> 32:03.917
- SAM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

32:03.917 --> 32:06.875
- I FIGURED IF I HAD A SON
WHO WAS GOING THROUGH SURGERY,

32:06.875 --> 32:10.542
I'D PROBABLY WANT
SOME BACKUP TOO, SO.

32:10.542 --> 32:11.959
- THANKS.

32:11.959 --> 32:13.959
- BROTHER SAM?

32:13.959 --> 32:17.083
YOU CAME IN
ON THE OMAR RIVERA CASE.

32:17.083 --> 32:21.667
ARE YOU GUYS, LIKE,
FRIENDS NOW?

32:21.667 --> 32:22.834
- UH.

32:22.834 --> 32:24.291
- YEAH, WELL,
I HAVE THE AUTO SHOP.

32:24.291 --> 32:26.875
- WE--YEP.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.041
- I'M GONNA GO
TO THE CAFETERIA,

32:29.041 --> 32:30.625
SEE IF ANYTHING'S EDIBLE.

32:30.625 --> 32:32.417
ANY TAKERS?

32:32.417 --> 32:34.792
- I'LL BROWSE.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.709
- HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

32:41.709 --> 32:42.959
- HONESTLY, NOT GOOD.

32:42.959 --> 32:45.542
I HATE NOT KNOWING
IF HE'S GONNA BE OKAY,

32:45.542 --> 32:47.125
NOT BEING ABLE
TO PROTECT HIM.

32:47.125 --> 32:49.917
- SOMETIMES YOU JUST...
GOT TO SURRENDER.

32:52.959 --> 32:53.959
I'M SORRY, MAN.

32:53.959 --> 32:55.542
THAT--THAT PROBABLY
WASN'T THE...

32:55.542 --> 32:58.458
- IT'S OKAY.
- BEST THING TO SAY.

32:58.458 --> 33:01.792
NO, IT'S...

33:01.792 --> 33:03.125
IF I WAS IN YOUR SITUATION,

33:03.125 --> 33:04.542
I WOULD NOT WANT
TO HEAR THAT SHIT.

33:04.542 --> 33:06.667
I'M--

33:06.667 --> 33:10.959
I USED TO NOT ALWAYS
BE LIKE THIS.

33:10.959 --> 33:14.083
PEOPLE USED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT GOD.

33:14.083 --> 33:17.083
MAN, USED TO MAKE ME
WANT TO PUNCH 'EM IN THEY FACE.

33:17.083 --> 33:21.250
- REALLY?
- YEAH, YEAH.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.709
- [sighs]

33:22.709 --> 33:25.750
- I USED TO BELIEVE
IN SOMETHING ELSE.

33:25.750 --> 33:30.291
- WHAT?

33:30.291 --> 33:32.458
- THE SAME AS YOU.
MY DAD.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.959
WHATEVER.
THAT--THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

33:37.959 --> 33:40.375
- WHAT HAPPENED?

33:40.375 --> 33:41.375
- [exhales]

33:41.375 --> 33:43.625
HEY, YOU GOT ENOUGH
ON YOUR MIND, MAN.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.083
YOU DON'T NEED TO--

33:45.083 --> 33:46.959
WANT TO HEAR NO STORIES
ABOUT ME AND MY DAD.

33:46.959 --> 33:49.125
- NO, I APPRECIATE
A DISTRACTION.

33:53.792 --> 33:55.250
- WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

33:55.250 --> 33:59.667
MY DAD WAS A REAL POPULAR GUY.

33:59.667 --> 34:03.166
EVERYBODY KNEW HIM.

34:03.166 --> 34:07.583
THEY USED TO
CALL HIM "MISTER."

34:07.583 --> 34:09.208
HE WAS ALWAYS WORKING,

34:09.208 --> 34:13.125
BUT I NEVER REALLY KNEW
WHAT HE DID.

34:13.125 --> 34:14.792
SO ONE DAY I ASKED HIM.

34:14.792 --> 34:16.291
I SAID,
"DADDY, WHAT DO YOU DO?"

34:16.291 --> 34:17.583
HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID,

34:17.583 --> 34:19.583
"WHATEVER I WANT,
WHENEVER I NEED."

34:19.583 --> 34:20.625
LIKE THAT.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.792
- HMM.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.667
- HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO...

34:24.667 --> 34:27.542
SEE A FRIEND OF HIS.

34:27.542 --> 34:30.542
SO WE GET THERE.

34:30.542 --> 34:32.458
HE SAYS, UH,
"NOW GO ON UP THERE

34:32.458 --> 34:34.625
AND RING THAT DOORBELL
FOR ME."

34:34.625 --> 34:37.917
SO I DO IT.

34:37.917 --> 34:41.041
AND THIS MAN
COMES TO THE DOOR.

34:41.041 --> 34:42.583
AND HE'S STARING AT ME,

34:42.583 --> 34:46.750
NOT KNOWING WHO I AM
OR WHY I'M THERE.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.792
AND BEFORE I CAN TURN AROUND

34:49.792 --> 34:52.917
AND SAY I'M WITH MISTER,

34:52.917 --> 34:55.750
MY DAD IS STANDING
RIGHT THERE BEHIND ME

34:55.750 --> 34:58.917
WITH A PISTOL IN HIS HAND.

34:58.917 --> 35:01.667
AND HE TAKES HIS PISTOL
AND HE POINTS IT AT THIS MAN,

35:01.667 --> 35:03.417
AND HE SHOOTS HIM
IN THE FACE.

35:03.417 --> 35:08.041
KILLED HIM.

35:08.041 --> 35:09.083
BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

35:09.083 --> 35:11.667
- [sighs]

35:11.667 --> 35:15.291
- ALL ON MY SUPERMAN SHIRT.

35:15.291 --> 35:20.000
MY DAD JUST CALMLY
PICKS ME UP,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.083
WALKS TO THE CAR,

35:22.083 --> 35:25.083
DRIVES OFF SLOWLY.

35:25.083 --> 35:29.500
AND HE SAYS,
"YOU DID A GOOD JOB."

35:35.875 --> 35:37.458
- HE USED YOU.

35:37.458 --> 35:42.208
- NO SURPRISE
I ENDED UP IN PRISON.

35:42.208 --> 35:46.250
- SO WHAT CHANGED?

35:46.250 --> 35:49.834
- [sighs]

35:49.834 --> 35:52.583
WELL,
WHEN I FIRST GOT LOCKED UP,

35:52.583 --> 35:54.250
THEM FIRST FEW MONTHS,

35:54.250 --> 35:56.417
I WAS JUST...

35:56.417 --> 35:58.750
MAD.

35:58.750 --> 36:03.250
AND I JUST WANTED
TO HURT SOMEBODY, ANYBODY.

36:05.750 --> 36:07.375
AND THIS NEW GUY COMES IN.

36:07.375 --> 36:11.375
AND HE'S JUST LOUD
AND BRAGGING,

36:11.375 --> 36:12.917
AND, "YEAH, YEAH,
THIS, THIS, THAT.

36:12.917 --> 36:14.625
I WAS THIS, THIS,
THAT IN THE STREET."

36:14.625 --> 36:16.375
AND SO I'M JUST
LOOKING AT HIM.

36:16.375 --> 36:20.083
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,
"OKAY, WHEN I GET A CHANCE,

36:20.083 --> 36:23.333
I'MA TUNE
THIS MOTHERFUCKER UP."

36:23.333 --> 36:26.792
SO WE GET YARD TIME,

36:26.792 --> 36:29.625
AND I'M FOLLOWING HIM.

36:29.625 --> 36:33.542
AND HE GOES INTO THE CHAPEL.

36:33.542 --> 36:39.208
I SNEAK UP ON HIM,
AND I START CHOKING HIM OUT.

36:39.208 --> 36:43.959
I'M TRYING TO KILL HIM.

36:43.959 --> 36:49.208
AND THEN I SEE THIS LIGHT.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.291
- LIKE, FIGURATIVELY,
OR--

36:52.291 --> 36:55.500
- NO, NO, LIKE, FOR REAL.
LIKE, LIGHT.

36:55.500 --> 37:01.166
SUNLIGHT COMING THROUGH
THESE CHAPEL WINDOWS, AND...

37:01.166 --> 37:05.166
I COULD JUST SEE
EVERYTHING AROUND ME.

37:05.166 --> 37:10.709
I COULD SEE WHERE I WAS AT
AND WHAT I WAS DOING, AND...

37:10.709 --> 37:14.125
I DIDN'T WANT
TO DO IT NO MORE.

37:14.125 --> 37:17.500
- AND YOU THINK
THAT WAS GOD?

37:21.709 --> 37:24.500
- DEXTER, ALL I KNOW

37:24.500 --> 37:28.959
IS THAT WHEN I LET
THAT MAN GO...

37:28.959 --> 37:34.750
I NEVER FELT THAT GOOD
ABOUT NOTHING IN MY LIFE.

37:34.750 --> 37:38.542
- [breathes deeply]

37:38.542 --> 37:40.834
I'M GONNA GRAB SOME COFFEE.

37:40.834 --> 37:43.375
- YEAH.

37:54.041 --> 37:56.750
[machine whirring,
struggling]

37:56.750 --> 37:59.709
- COME ON.

37:59.709 --> 38:01.875
COME ON.

38:06.667 --> 38:07.917
JUST LET HIM BE OKAY.

38:07.917 --> 38:10.291
PLEASE LET HIM BE OKAY.

38:18.917 --> 38:20.333
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WORKS,

38:20.333 --> 38:22.333
BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO IN RETURN,

38:22.333 --> 38:24.417
I'LL DO IT.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.125
OKAY?

38:53.417 --> 38:56.500
- YOU GOING OUT
WITH THAT WOMAN, AREN'T YOU?

38:56.500 --> 38:58.625
- HER NAME IS ERIN.

38:58.625 --> 39:00.333
IF YOU LIKE, I COULD CANCEL.

39:00.333 --> 39:02.333
I COULD STAY HERE WITH YOU.

39:02.333 --> 39:04.291
THERE'S MORE WORK
I COULD DO.

39:04.291 --> 39:08.542
- NO, WE WERE GIVEN FREE WILL
FOR A REASON, TRAVIS.

39:10.250 --> 39:15.208
YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT...

39:15.208 --> 39:19.500
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE WILLING TO...

39:19.500 --> 39:22.333
ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES
GOD GIVES YOU.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.959
- IT'S JUST DINNER.

39:31.959 --> 39:34.291
I'LL BE BACK HOME BY 10:00.

39:40.709 --> 39:43.166
GOOD NIGHT.

39:50.208 --> 39:53.834
- AND YOUR PARENTS,
ARE YOU CLOSE?

39:53.834 --> 39:55.542
- YES, WE WERE.

39:55.542 --> 39:58.834
THEY DIED WHEN I WAS 14.
CAR WRECK.

39:58.834 --> 40:02.166
- I AM SO SORRY.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

40:02.166 --> 40:05.875
- MY SISTER PRETTY MUCH
RAISED ME AFTER THAT.

40:05.875 --> 40:08.667
- POOR THING.

40:08.667 --> 40:11.208
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY LUCKY
THAT YOU HAD EACH OTHER.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.834
I WANT YOU, TRAVIS.

40:23.125 --> 40:27.083
TRAVIS.

40:27.083 --> 40:29.625
[moaning softly]

41:05.458 --> 41:09.041
[door opens]

41:09.041 --> 41:10.458
- KID'S A CHAMP.

41:10.458 --> 41:12.125
MADE IT THROUGH
WITH FLYING COLORS.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.667
- OH, THANK GOD.

41:13.667 --> 41:15.250
I MEAN, UH, THANK YOU.

41:15.250 --> 41:16.625
THANK YOU SO MUCH, DOCTOR.

41:16.625 --> 41:17.709
- MY PLEASURE.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.458
UH, THEY'RE TAKING HIM UP
TO RECOVERY NOW.

41:19.458 --> 41:21.625
YOU CAN SEE HIM
IN A FEW MINUTES.

41:21.625 --> 41:24.458
- I KNEW HE'D BE OKAY.

41:24.458 --> 41:26.583
I GOT TO GO.
MATTHEWS WANTS TO TALK TO ME.

41:26.583 --> 41:28.083
PROBABLY ABOUT THE CONFERENCE.

41:28.083 --> 41:31.417
I'M TOTALLY FUCKED.

41:31.417 --> 41:33.000
- LONG DAY.
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.625
- ARE YOU SURE?
I CAN HANG.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.291
- NO, GO. I'LL CALL YOU
IF ANYTHING CHANGES.

41:36.291 --> 41:37.959
- OKAY.
GOOD NIGHT.

41:37.959 --> 41:40.125
- NIGHT.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.917
- THANKS FOR STAYING.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

41:41.917 --> 41:43.667
- NOT A PROBLEM.
I WANTED TO.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.959
I'M GLAD LITTLE MAN
IS ALL RIGHT.

41:45.959 --> 41:48.333
- YEAH, ME TOO.

41:48.333 --> 41:51.000
- I KNOW.
"THANK GOD."

41:51.000 --> 41:54.166
- THAT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.

41:54.166 --> 41:56.500
- I KNOW.
JUST, UH...

41:56.500 --> 41:58.500
ANOTHER MARVEL
OF MODERN SCIENCE.

41:58.500 --> 41:59.834
- YEAH,
YOU PUT YOUR FAITH IN GOD,

41:59.834 --> 42:01.000
I PUT MY FAITH IN SCIENCE.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.458
- IT'S COOL.

42:02.458 --> 42:04.291
WE DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE
IN THE SAME THING, BUT...

42:04.291 --> 42:08.417
YOU GOT TO KEEP
AN OPEN MIND.

42:08.417 --> 42:11.458
YOU MAY SAY I CAN'T PROVE
THAT GOD EXISTS,

42:11.458 --> 42:13.166
BUT, UH...

42:13.166 --> 42:14.709
YOU CAN'T PROVE HE DOESN'T.

42:14.709 --> 42:18.500
HMM?

42:18.500 --> 42:21.291
YOU TAKE CARE, DEX.

42:35.542 --> 42:36.500
- [knocks]

42:36.500 --> 42:38.208
DEPUTY CHIEF?

42:38.208 --> 42:41.041
- MORGAN.
DID YOU SEE THE NEWS?

42:41.041 --> 42:42.875
I BEEN GETTING CALLS
ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT.

42:42.875 --> 42:45.542
- I DID, SIR. LET ME JUST SAY
THAT I AM TRULY, DEEPLY--

42:45.542 --> 42:48.000
- EVERYBODY LOVES MY NEW
SPARKPLUG OF A LIEUTENANT.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.417
- THEY DO?

42:49.417 --> 42:51.709
- YOU'RE DIRECT.
NO BULLSHIT.

42:51.709 --> 42:53.417
- WELL, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET THE COMMUNITY--

42:53.417 --> 42:56.291
- YOU KNOW, I TOOK A BIG RISK
WHEN I PROMOTED YOU, MORGAN.

42:56.291 --> 42:59.291
I TOOK A LOT OF CRAP
FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE.

42:59.291 --> 43:01.875
BUT TODAY--

43:01.875 --> 43:04.500
TODAY, YOU'VE MADE ME
VERY, VERY PROUD.

43:04.500 --> 43:09.834
YOUR DAD WOULD
HAVE BEEN PROUD TOO.

43:09.834 --> 43:14.750
KEEP UP THE GOOD FUCKING WORK.

43:14.750 --> 43:17.375
- THANK YOU, SIR.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.917
- HEY.

43:22.917 --> 43:26.250
WHICH ONE OF YOU CHARACTERS
DRIVES A FIREBIRD?

43:26.250 --> 43:29.417
CROCKETT OR TUBBS?

43:29.417 --> 43:30.875
YOU PARK LIKE A DICK.

43:30.875 --> 43:34.583
[laughter]

43:34.583 --> 43:36.041
- YOU GUYS WANT
TO GO IN MY OFFICE,

43:36.041 --> 43:39.417
TELL ME WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN UP TO?

43:39.417 --> 43:40.417
- WELL, WE'LL BE RIGHT IN.

43:40.417 --> 43:42.083
- I'VE BEEN MEANING

43:42.083 --> 43:43.583
FOR THAT FASHION ADVICE.

43:43.583 --> 43:48.125
REALLY UPPED
MY PROFESSIONAL FACTOR.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.375
JESUS, ANDERSON.

43:49.375 --> 43:50.834
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
SAY IT?

43:50.834 --> 43:52.333
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
LIEUTENANT,

43:52.333 --> 43:54.375
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
WATCH THE LANGUAGE.

43:54.375 --> 43:56.125
- WELL,
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

43:56.125 --> 43:58.750
MATTHEWS SAID
PEOPLE LIKED IT.

44:01.792 --> 44:03.208
- [clears throat]

44:03.208 --> 44:05.625
WE HAVE A LEAD.

44:05.625 --> 44:08.291

I CAN TRY AND GET

44:34.834 --> 44:36.500
- YOU--YOU CAN'T
GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM,

44:36.500 --> 44:37.834
BECAUSE HE WENT UNDERGROUND.

- LIKE THE ONE MASUKA
THINKS OUR KILLER

44:54.333 --> 44:55.458
COULD HAVE USED

44:55.458 --> 44:56.917
- JUST LIKE THAT.

44:56.917 --> 44:58.583
OH, AND GET THIS.

44:58.583 --> 45:01.500
THIS ISN'T JUST
ANY ROMAN SWORD.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.166
ACCORDING TO MEDIEVAL LEGEND,

45:03.166 --> 45:06.792
THIS ONE BELONGED
TO JOHN THE REVELATOR.

45:08.333 --> 45:11.125
THE GUY WHO ACTUALLY

45:22.291 --> 45:25.667

45:36.875 --> 45:37.875

45:37.875 --> 45:39.750
- YOU KNEW
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

45:40.875 --> 45:44.083
- NO. PLEASE.
LET HER GO.

45:44.083 --> 45:45.291
I LIKE HER.

45:45.291 --> 45:46.709
- YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

45:46.709 --> 45:49.834
BEFORE YOU DEFILED HER.

45:49.834 --> 45:51.834
IT'S THE BEST THING FOR HER.

45:54.792 --> 45:57.917
SHE'S PART OF GOD'S PLAN NOW.

46:09.250 --> 46:12.542
- LOOKS LIKE YOUR PRAYERS
WERE ANSWERED.

46:12.542 --> 46:14.250
- I WAS DESPERATE.

46:14.250 --> 46:16.417
- HEY, NO JUDGMENT.

46:16.417 --> 46:18.667
YOU ALREADY TALK
TO AN IMAGINARY FATHER FIGURE.

46:18.667 --> 46:20.250
- IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

46:20.250 --> 46:22.417
- ARE YOU SURE?

46:22.417 --> 46:26.875
HARRISON'S OKAY,
AND YOU DID MAKE THAT PACT.

46:30.625 --> 46:31.959
- COME ON.

46:31.959 --> 46:33.750
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE

46:33.750 --> 46:35.208
HOLDING MY I.O.U.

46:35.208 --> 46:37.542
- I DON'T KNOW.

46:37.542 --> 46:39.041
BUT IF THERE IS,
YOU'D BETTER BE READY

46:39.041 --> 46:42.625
TO PAY THE PIPER.

46:42.625 --> 46:43.625
- [sighs]

46:43.625 --> 46:45.583
[cell phone ringing]

46:46.834 --> 46:48.417
[phone beeps]
HEY.

46:48.417 --> 46:50.291
- HEY.
HOW'S HARRISON?

46:50.291 --> 46:51.792
- HE'S FINE.
HE'S SLEEPING.

46:51.792 --> 46:53.458
- ARE YOU SURE? 'CAUSE I
WOULDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU--

46:53.458 --> 46:54.625
- DEB, JUST TELL ME WHAT'S UP.

46:54.625 --> 46:57.458
- GOT A CALL TO A CRIME SCENE
IN CORAL GABLES.

46:57.458 --> 46:59.291
A GARDNER
AT THE BOTANICAL GARDENS

46:59.291 --> 47:02.625
FOUND AN ALPHA AND AN OMEGA
OUTSIDE THE GREENHOUSE.

47:02.625 --> 47:04.125
- YOU THINK IT'S DOOMSDAY?

47:04.125 --> 47:06.166
- COULD BE.
AND WE MIGHT HAVE A SUSPECT.

47:06.166 --> 47:07.750
A MIDDLE-AGED PROFESSOR.

47:07.750 --> 47:10.000
- I'M NOT SURE
IF I SHOULD LEAVE.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.834
- DEXTER. SORRY.

47:11.834 --> 47:13.583
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO EAVESDROP OR ANYTHING,

47:13.583 --> 47:15.500
BUT IF THAT'S WORK,
YOU SHOULD GO.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.667
- BUT HARRISON--
- HARRISON IS SOUND ASLEEP.

47:17.667 --> 47:19.959
BETWEEN THE PAIN KILLERS
AND THE SEDATIVES THEY GAVE HIM,

47:19.959 --> 47:22.083
YOU CAN PROBABLY GET THERE AND
BACK BEFORE HE EVEN WAKES UP.

47:22.083 --> 47:24.709
- DEX, AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING
LIKE THE WORLD'S WORST AUNT,

47:24.709 --> 47:26.417
I COULD REALLY
USE YOU ON THIS.

47:26.417 --> 47:28.875
THERE'S BLOOD.

47:28.875 --> 47:30.125
- I'LL BE THERE.
[phone beeps]

47:30.125 --> 47:31.208
CALL ME THE MINUTE
HE WAKES UP.

47:31.208 --> 47:33.291
- I WILL.

47:36.834 --> 47:39.208
- I WAS DRAWN TO SCIENCE
OUT OF CURIOSITY.

47:39.208 --> 47:42.959
ANY QUESTIONS I HAD,
THE ANSWERS WERE ALREADY THERE.

47:44.834 --> 47:47.291
BUT EVEN SCIENCE
IS NEVER CERTAIN.

47:47.291 --> 47:49.083
EVEN THE SOUNDEST OF THEORIES

47:49.083 --> 47:50.834
IS SUBJECT TO NEW DATA.

47:50.834 --> 47:54.750
AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS
EVEN SCIENCE CAN'T EXPLAIN.

47:54.750 --> 47:56.500
BROTHER SAM WOULD SAY
IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT

47:56.500 --> 47:57.834
THAT I'VE STUMBLED
ONTO A KILLER

47:57.834 --> 48:00.583
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE
HIS OWN KIND OF FAITH.

48:00.583 --> 48:02.583
AND WHILE I DON'T BELIEVE
IN AN UNSEEN HAND

48:02.583 --> 48:04.959
CREATING HIS OWN TABLEAU,

48:04.959 --> 48:08.583
I DO BELIEVE
I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.

48:08.583 --> 48:10.166
- DEX, THANKS FOR COMING.

48:10.166 --> 48:11.083
- WHAT DO WE GOT?

48:11.083 --> 48:14.500
- BLOOD.
AND FUCKIN' FISH.

48:23.875 --> 48:26.166
- CATCH OF THE DAY.

48:30.041 --> 48:32.041
- IT DIDN'T GET HERE
ON ITS OWN.

48:32.041 --> 48:34.417
SO WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

48:43.375 --> 48:46.417
- DEX, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

48:46.417 --> 48:48.458
- OVER HERE.

48:48.458 --> 48:51.125
CHECK THIS OUT.

48:55.291 --> 48:57.875
HANDLE.

49:09.959 --> 49:12.458
[dramatic note]

49:12.458 --> 49:13.458
- HOLY SHIT.

49:13.458 --> 49:15.709
- IN HERE!

49:18.250 --> 49:21.417
- [muffled screams]

49:21.417 --> 49:23.750
MM-MM! MM-MM!

49:26.166 --> 49:28.625
- NO!

49:28.625 --> 49:30.375
- [muffled scream]

49:30.375 --> 49:32.125
- NO!

49:38.125 --> 49:39.250
- DEB, WAIT!

49:39.250 --> 49:40.709
COULD BE ANOTHER TRAP.

49:40.709 --> 49:42.625
- OH, GOD.
WE HAVE TO HELP HER.

49:42.625 --> 49:44.083
- HER JUGULAR'S PUNCTURED.

49:44.083 --> 49:45.834
SHE'S ALREADY GONE.

49:45.834 --> 49:47.959
- OH, SHIT, SHIT,
SHIT, SHIT, SHIT.

49:50.750 --> 49:53.208
- KILL NUMBER THREE.
IT'S OFFICIAL.

49:53.208 --> 49:55.417
HE'S A SERIAL KILLER.

49:56.458 --> 49:58.125
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
EVERYBODY.

49:58.125 --> 50:01.917
LISTEN.
[distant screeching]

50:01.917 --> 50:04.834
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

50:04.834 --> 50:07.291
- IT'S COMING FROM OVER HERE.

50:22.417 --> 50:23.959
- [speaking Spanish]

50:33.667 --> 50:36.125
- LOCUSTS.

50:52.500 --> 50:55.500
I'M NOT LOOKING AT DEBRA'S
MIDDLE-AGED PROFESSOR.

50:55.500 --> 50:58.709
IS THIS DOOMSDAY NUMBER TWO?

51:03.041 --> 51:05.166
BUT THAT'S NOT THE LOOK
OF A MURDERER.

51:05.166 --> 51:07.834
THAT'S THE LOOK OF A MAN
WITH TRUE FAITH.

51:07.834 --> 51:10.542
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE
ON BROTHER SAM.

51:10.542 --> 51:12.542
WHATEVER THIS GUY BELIEVES,

51:12.542 --> 51:15.083
HE KNOWS IT TO BE TRUE.
