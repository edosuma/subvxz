WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:03.569
It is nothing
to get worked up about.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.104
On the day you're
supposed to move in
with me?

00:05.106 --> 00:06.905
I know.
You're not even done
unpacking yet.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.874
Teresa, you have
your appointment

00:08.876 --> 00:10.009
At the adoption agency.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.143
We are gonna
make this work.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.644
Katie: Everybody, remember.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.813
We are here to help
sick people feel better.

00:14.815 --> 00:15.981
I was gonna meet
dr. Sanders.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.449
She was gonna take
them on a tour.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.984
You understand
the precautions

00:19.052 --> 00:20.352
We need to take,
dr. Sanders?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.521
I--I just
started rounds.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.790
The first patient
was a syrian kid.

00:24.792 --> 00:25.791
Lex: So, what's going on?

00:25.793 --> 00:27.192
Possible flu outbreak.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.294
Sabine lommers.
Health and human
services.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.529
Dr. Cannerts
has identified

00:30.531 --> 00:32.031
A possible public
health threat.

00:32.033 --> 00:33.365
And there's a syrian
kid who needs to be

00:33.367 --> 00:34.666
Picked up
for questioning.

00:34.668 --> 00:35.768
Jake, you'll
run point.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.269
Think it would be
wise if you

00:37.271 --> 00:38.804
Stayed here a while.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.672
They're officially
putting the hospital
on lockdown.

00:40.674 --> 00:41.707
I've got 14 kids here.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.275
I feel like I should
know if it's bad.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.278
At 1629,
patient zero was
pronounced dead.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.514
And the faster we can
initiate contact tracing,

00:48.516 --> 00:50.282
The faster we can
contain this outbreak.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.384
Lommers: This is now a matter
of national security.

00:52.452 --> 00:54.920
As such, I recommend
that we institute

00:54.922 --> 00:56.221
Top-level containment measures

00:56.223 --> 00:57.956
To protect the citizens
of this city.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.324
No, screw you, lex.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.926
You're the one who
sent me in here.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.961
Lex: I can't let you
through there.
I'm sorry.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.830
My girl is in there.
So is mine.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.034
Lommers: Once we're
48 hours disease-free,

01:09.036 --> 01:10.335
Our lives can go back to normal

01:10.337 --> 01:12.538
And this will be over
before it begins.

01:32.225 --> 01:36.195
Continuing the post mortem
of sayid nassir, age 22.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.830
Preliminary cause of death
believed to be

01:37.832 --> 01:40.332
A result of infection by
a genetically altered

01:40.334 --> 01:42.734
Form of h7n2 influenza.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.070
The virus has been
engineered to express

01:45.072 --> 01:47.339
A filovirus protein,

01:47.341 --> 01:51.009
Explaining its
hemorrhagic presentation.

01:51.011 --> 01:53.178
I'll begin the internal
examination.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.853
I've examined the organs
in situ in the rib cage...

02:00.855 --> 02:02.855
[indistinct chatter]

02:11.097 --> 02:12.364
I understand your concerns,

02:12.366 --> 02:14.233
But if the professionals
in this room

02:14.235 --> 02:15.634
Are panicking,
how am I supposed

02:15.636 --> 02:17.569
To get the rest of the country
to stay calm?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.705
Not to mention the citizens
who have been quarantined

02:19.707 --> 02:21.540
Within the boundaries of
the cordon sanitaire?

02:21.542 --> 02:23.809
Woman on tv: ...Have been
exposed and possibly infected

02:23.811 --> 02:25.811
By the deadly virus.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.646
Lommers: The people will get
their news from the press.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.048
The press will get
their news from us.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.416
Right now,
convincing the people

02:31.484 --> 02:33.185
Inside the cordon
to follow the rules

02:33.187 --> 02:34.286
Is what's separating
them from

02:34.288 --> 02:35.787
Mass exposure
to the virus.

02:35.789 --> 02:39.091
Cannerts: Bile in the liver
is to be expected.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.659
Once I remove the stomach...

02:40.661 --> 02:43.295
Lommers: We're less than an hour
in, so, let me be clear.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.697
There is currently no vaccine,
there is no cure,

02:45.699 --> 02:47.499
And it has thus far
proven to have

02:47.501 --> 02:49.835
A mortality rate of 100%.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.171
The only thing keeping
the rest of us safe

02:52.173 --> 02:54.506
Is if we ensure that
the virus stays within

02:54.508 --> 02:56.575
The boundaries of the cordon.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.210
Man: Excuse me, ma'am.
What will happen

02:58.212 --> 03:00.679
If the virus is found
outside the cordon?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.181
We believe that
contact tracing

03:02.183 --> 03:04.683
Has isolated all known
carriers of the virus

03:04.751 --> 03:06.718
And thankfully,
all those people

03:06.720 --> 03:08.020
Have been contained.

03:08.022 --> 03:11.123
Ok. Let's continue
with the round-up.
Chief besser?

03:11.125 --> 03:12.758
Besser: Over here.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.360
The electric fences
are being activated
around the perimeter.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.862
Officers from all zones
have been

03:16.864 --> 03:18.330
Brought in for
crowd control.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.132
We've asked for
additional support
on the ground

03:20.134 --> 03:21.366
From outlying counties

03:21.368 --> 03:22.701
And people are
asking me

03:22.703 --> 03:25.437
If there'll be any
military involvement.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.438
If we
handle this properly,

03:26.440 --> 03:27.639
We won't need them.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.707
Where's fema?

03:28.709 --> 03:31.643
Cannerts: Pulmonary sac
is filled with blood,

03:31.645 --> 03:34.346
Likely leading to severe
cardiogenic shock.

03:35.582 --> 03:39.251
Complete necrosis of the kidney.

03:39.319 --> 03:43.722
Eyes and skin are jaundiced.

03:43.724 --> 03:48.660
The lungs indicate severe
pulmonary congestion.

03:50.396 --> 03:54.566
Bilaterally, pleurae
has adhesions.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.006
The condition of the liver
suggests autolysis.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.508
Indicators show blood clotting

04:03.510 --> 04:06.311
Has been
significantly inhibited.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.683
Spleen is engorged.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.987
[gasping]

04:21.194 --> 04:24.429
All evidence indicates
that the timeframe

04:24.431 --> 04:28.233
From exposure to expiration

04:28.235 --> 04:30.269
Is under 48 hours.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.339
Cannerts: I must
declare the virus as

04:34.341 --> 04:38.644
Highly contagious and fatal
in 100% of its victims.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.146
Lommers: I recommend
we institute a cordon sanitaire

04:41.148 --> 04:42.247
To contain the spread
of the virus.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.949
Lex: What I need is the truth.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.917
Jake: Yeah, I'm in the middle of
the damn hot zone, lex.
Jana!

04:45.919 --> 04:48.120
Lex: If we let anyone out,
we're risking the lives

04:48.122 --> 04:49.821
Of everyone in this city.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.727
Woman: The situation
is chaotic at best,

04:55.729 --> 04:58.297
As thousands have been
displaced from their homes

04:58.299 --> 05:00.032
And separated from loved ones.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.801
I'm standing here in the 500
block of spring street,

05:02.803 --> 05:05.137
At the outer edge of
the cordon's perimeter.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.439
We'll be reporting to you live
as the situation develops.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.740
I'm lindsay savage.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.842
I understand your
concerns about
your pets,

05:10.844 --> 05:13.011
But is there anybody
that you can call?

05:13.013 --> 05:15.947
Any--sir, I need you
to back away
from that fence.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.549
It has an
electrical--sir!

05:17.617 --> 05:20.385
Sir, the point of this
fence is for your
safety.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.054
Ok? Do not tempt fate.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.756
...Please.
Please.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.227
Follow the rules,
all right?

05:29.229 --> 05:30.662
Keep 4 to 6
feet apart.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.198
Stay inside.
It's for
your own good.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.266
Man: You'll be all right, baby.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.767
Hey, media stays
behind the line.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.302
Man: Officer, can I
have your name, please?

05:37.304 --> 05:38.537
It's major.
I'm a little busy here.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.272
Leo green.
Intheperimeter.Com.

05:40.274 --> 05:41.907
That's very nice,
but as you can see,

05:41.909 --> 05:45.344
Media relations
is not my top priority
at this exact moment.

05:45.346 --> 05:48.080
...I'm about to make
you a national hero.

05:48.082 --> 05:49.481
Shot this an hour ago.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.249
[indistinct shouting]

05:51.317 --> 05:53.485
Cop saves black kid
from white brutality.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.654
That is good stuff.
Care to comment?

05:55.656 --> 05:56.822
I'm a little bit
more concerned

05:56.824 --> 05:58.690
About the safety of
all these people.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.759
So, why don't you step
back behind the media line

06:00.761 --> 06:02.461
Before I'm forced
to arrest you.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.999
[telephone ringing]

06:10.036 --> 06:11.336
[beep]
hey.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.637
Where are you?

06:12.639 --> 06:13.638
I'm at my office.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.639
I got turned away
at spring.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.108
What's going on?

06:16.110 --> 06:18.110
It's bad, baby.

06:18.112 --> 06:21.680
They've quarantined
a 4-square-mile of the city.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.149
Oh, my--are you
all right?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.917
Wait, which section?
Where are you?

06:25.919 --> 06:26.985
I tried to call you

06:26.987 --> 06:29.020
To make sure that
you got out in time.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.021
Wait, lex, I don't--

06:32.925 --> 06:34.793
My section?

06:34.795 --> 06:37.362
It's--it's gonna
be ok.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.464
They're saying
it's just 48 hours.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.799
Turn on the news.
They're broadcasting

06:40.801 --> 06:42.901
All the rules that
you need to follow.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.203
It's not airborne.
It can only be spread

06:45.205 --> 06:46.738
Through bodily fluids.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.207
Sweat, blood,
stuff like that.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.442
And jake's
in there, too,

06:50.444 --> 06:52.778
So if you need
anything, you call him, ok?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.346
But your office is
probably the safest place

06:54.348 --> 06:55.647
That you can be
right now.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.349
Yeah, ok, I'll stay
in the cleaning room.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.917
It's all sanitized.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.186
I'll come to get you
as soon as I can.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.821
47 hours at the most.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.123
Whatever you do,
you stay safe, ok?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.725
I love you.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.027
Jana: I will.
Woman on tv: People are
strongly encouraged...

07:09.029 --> 07:10.562
I love you, too.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.731
Woman on tv: ...And practice
what they're calling
social distance

07:12.733 --> 07:14.900
By remaining 4 to 6 feet apart.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.002
Man on tv: The atlanta police
department and the city--

07:19.238 --> 07:21.139
[telephone ringing]

07:21.141 --> 07:24.176
[beeping]

07:24.178 --> 07:26.144
[buzzing]

07:30.283 --> 07:33.552
Whoever that is
must've really
done you wrong.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.387
Why do you say that?

07:35.389 --> 07:37.556
We're in the hot zone
of an outbreak.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.392
Most people would
answer a phone call.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.660
It was just work.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.464
So you're dodging calls
from the police?

07:48.568 --> 07:51.136
I think I'm officially
on holiday.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.938
Quentin: Mom?

07:52.940 --> 07:54.139
Yeah, sweetie?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.474
Quentin: I can't sleep.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.010
Let me see your hands.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.952
That's not
4 to 6 feet.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.054
We'll make an exception
just this once.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.958
What do we say when
we're home?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.660
There are no monsters
under the bed.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.696
No monsters
in your head.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.965
Tomorrow brings
new day of light.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.868
Sweet dreams, my prince.
Good night.

08:33.946 --> 08:36.681
Man on p.A.: 4 to 6 feet
away from each other.

08:36.749 --> 08:39.317
It is imperative
that you stay inside

08:39.319 --> 08:41.119
And remain in full quarantine.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.687
Woman on tv: The video posted
earlier this evening

08:42.689 --> 08:45.357
On leo greene's blog
in the perimeter shows...

08:45.359 --> 08:46.458
You're famous.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.059
I'd rather be
inside with you.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.729
Better you're not.
It's like black Friday
in here.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.764
My mom's being
as classy as always.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.366
She already jacked up
the prices.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.635
She give you any trouble
for trying to run off
with me?

08:56.637 --> 08:57.869
I don't know if
she noticed.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.838
I walked right in earlier
with my suitcase

08:59.840 --> 09:01.239
And she didn't say a word.

09:02.241 --> 09:03.675
How's our baby?

09:04.577 --> 09:05.977
Cool as a cucumber.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.812
I wish I could
say the same.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.281
Little worried
about giving birth

09:09.348 --> 09:11.149
In the middle of
contagion city.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.617
It's only two days.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.519
And we can talk
every hour on the hour.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.321
Sounds good.
Mm. Gotta go.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.389
Aimee's calling.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.523
Is she inside?

09:18.525 --> 09:20.425
I'll have to find out.
Love you.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.593
Xander: Love you, too.
Teresa: Hi.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.429
Teresa, oh, my god,
where are you?

09:24.431 --> 09:26.364
At the store.
I didn't make it out.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.632
[music playing behind aimee]

09:27.634 --> 09:28.733
Apparently, you did.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.935
No, dude, I'm at toby's.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.136
His parents didn't
make it through

09:31.138 --> 09:32.470
Before the fences
went up, so we're

09:32.472 --> 09:34.272
Raiding the liquor
stash.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.507
Get over here.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.808
You do realize we're
in the middle of

09:36.810 --> 09:38.143
A possible terrorist attack.

09:38.145 --> 09:42.781
Live fast, die young.
Come on over. Mwah!

09:42.848 --> 09:43.949
Bye.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.950
[beep]

09:46.552 --> 09:47.886
[sigh]

09:48.754 --> 09:50.956
[siren wailing]

10:26.592 --> 10:27.592
[knocking on window]

10:27.594 --> 10:29.127
Damn! Suzy,
what the--

10:29.129 --> 10:31.830
Sorry. Just let us in,
ok? Dennis has to pee.

10:33.165 --> 10:34.165
[beep]

10:38.237 --> 10:40.238
[suzy giggling]

10:44.510 --> 10:45.710
Bathroom.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.278
What are you doing here?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.614
Why aren't you home,
10 miles away from
all this mess?

10:49.682 --> 10:51.750
I got stuck at happy
hour with dennis.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.751
We left to get
the marta home,

10:52.753 --> 10:55.120
But no marta,
no home, so.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.155
I guess now we're
stuck in here
with you.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.759
I love you.
I'm pissed you're here.

11:02.194 --> 11:03.294
Where are you going?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.430
I'm following the rules
and going to bed.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.965
And so should you.

11:09.301 --> 11:10.702
Alone.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.839
[indistinct chatter]

11:14.841 --> 11:17.909
Hard at work, gentlemen?
Ladies.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.578
Hey, hero.
Boys,

11:20.580 --> 11:22.047
Make way for
our very own

11:22.114 --> 11:24.616
Big hero
major carnahan.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.151
Lex: I don't need
to remind you

11:26.153 --> 11:27.018
That that was you

11:27.020 --> 11:28.586
Pinning that kid
on the street.

11:28.588 --> 11:29.821
It's not like
I shot him.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.489
You're a real gift
to society.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.824
You know that,
walden?

11:33.926 --> 11:36.494
Listen. That video
is an example

11:36.496 --> 11:37.962
Of what we're
up against here.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.799
The eyes of the world
are on us.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.034
Which means there is
no room for error.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.537
If the public don't trust us,
they don't listen to us,

11:45.539 --> 11:48.306
And if they don't listen to us,
people end up dead.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.642
Now, there are
4,000
innocent lives

11:50.644 --> 11:52.110
Being held
inside those
gates,

11:52.112 --> 11:55.313
And their one
goal is to stay
healthy.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.848
Our one goal--

11:56.850 --> 11:58.216
Make sure those gates hold.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.519
Because if they don't,
every person in this city

12:01.521 --> 12:03.221
Is at risk of exposure.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.457
And once that virus is out,
it is out.

12:05.459 --> 12:06.758
You hear me?

12:09.228 --> 12:11.229
[gasping]

12:29.949 --> 12:32.951
Quarantine. Does anyone
know what this means?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.719
It's like a snow day
for sick people.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.554
-[laughter]
-I can always count on you

12:36.556 --> 12:39.057
For answers, thomas. Mary.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.391
It's an isolation period

12:40.393 --> 12:42.327
For anyone who's been
exposed to a disease.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.462
Katie: Exactly.
People in this hospital

12:44.464 --> 12:45.797
Have been exposed to a flu

12:45.799 --> 12:46.865
That the doctors can't fix yet.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.133
They don't want anyone to leave

12:48.135 --> 12:49.534
Until they know we're
not sick, either.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.503
Is that why
britney went away?

12:51.505 --> 12:52.904
Britney is fine, quentin.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.806
Her mom's boyfriend
is with her.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.608
When will
our parents get here?

12:56.610 --> 12:58.042
When the quarantine is over.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.310
Then we'll all be sent home.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.547
Katie: Yes, bert.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.116
My wife micheline
is home alone.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.018
Who decides when
we get to leave?

13:08.921 --> 13:10.655
That's a good question.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.557
I will have to get
back to you on that.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.126
Man on tv: Showing us that
even as the city is torn apart

13:15.128 --> 13:17.061
By this volatile situation,

13:17.063 --> 13:19.130
There is always room
for a hero.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.165
Nice piece.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.000
Just a hack blogger
looking for an angle.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.401
Still, it is why
I hand-picked you

13:23.403 --> 13:25.770
To be the
representative for
the atlanta p.D.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.273
You're a good guy.
A good face.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.474
People need someone
to believe in

13:29.476 --> 13:30.475
In times like this.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.077
This is not
a bad thing.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.980
I am concerned,
however, about
your girlfriend.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.549
What's her name?

13:37.551 --> 13:38.583
It's jana.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.684
Jana's inside
the cordon?

13:39.686 --> 13:40.718
Yes, ma'am.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.953
Your best friend
on the force?

13:41.955 --> 13:44.823
Officer jake riley?
Also inside?

13:45.858 --> 13:47.358
Is that going to be
a problem?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.393
In what way?

13:48.395 --> 13:49.861
Upholding the
boundaries
of the cordon

13:49.863 --> 13:51.796
Is paramount
to containing
this virus.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.998
No one gets in,
no one gets out.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.867
So, if your
personal attachments

13:55.869 --> 13:57.602
Lead to any rules
being compromised,

13:57.604 --> 13:58.803
Any special
treatment--

13:58.805 --> 14:00.471
I know what my duty
is to this city.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.541
That's what I told
the others.

14:04.777 --> 14:08.112
Ahem. Dr. Cannerts.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.748
I'd like you to meet
major carnahan
from zone 6.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.116
He's running point
from the outside.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.185
Major, dr. Cannerts
is from the cdc.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.187
He's on the ground
inside the cordon

14:16.189 --> 14:19.624
With the exposed
patients at atlanta
midtown hospital.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.393
I wish we were
meeting under better
circumstances.

14:23.929 --> 14:26.264
How many patients
do you have under lockdown?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.766
The 5 family members
of patient zero,

14:28.768 --> 14:31.269
Two doctors,
two nurses,

14:31.271 --> 14:33.471
And a currently
asymptomatic
11-year-old

14:33.473 --> 14:35.440
Who may have
just had a bout
with allergies.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.843
Your friend officer
riley, he was not
among the sick.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.778
-I wasn't--
-it's ok, lex.

14:40.846 --> 14:44.115
One of the benefits of
having this kind of
access is information.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.516
Cannerts: He is here
at the hospital.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.219
We're holding civilians
in an old storage wing.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.755
He'll be safe.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.424
I appreciate
the update.
Thank you.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.462
[telephone buzzing]

15:02.401 --> 15:04.602
[children chattering
indistinctly]

15:06.138 --> 15:09.774
Katie: Guys, seriously?
I said walk.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.943
No worries, just
some innocent kids

15:11.945 --> 15:13.311
Running around
a creepy hospital.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.047
I got this one.
You seem super busy.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.248
Need some help?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.317
Too little, too late,
jake riley.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.991
Cannerts: Officer.

15:26.993 --> 15:29.394
Your friend
major carnahan

15:29.396 --> 15:31.362
Said you might be
of some assistance.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.431
Oh, did he?

15:36.535 --> 15:37.568
[bouncing ball]

15:38.871 --> 15:40.471
Tony forgot to do
the shopping.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.674
Tony's an idiot.
How much is there?

15:43.876 --> 15:45.443
Less than we need,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.412
And more than you
and I have had
in the past.

15:47.479 --> 15:48.613
Group home rations.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.715
My childhood is
flashing before
my eyes.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.050
Yeah. Tell me
about it.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.652
Where's dennis?

15:54.654 --> 15:55.987
On the phone
with his wife.

15:57.556 --> 15:59.724
So, what does lex
have to say about
all this?

15:59.726 --> 16:01.292
He says if we
follow the rules

16:01.294 --> 16:03.061
And stay isolated,
we'll be fine.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.128
Did he remind you
that if you'd

16:04.130 --> 16:05.630
Just moved in
with him yesterday

16:05.632 --> 16:07.165
Like you were
supposed to,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.067
You'd be safe on the
outside with your
man right now?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.335
Hey, if you'd
gone home after work

16:10.337 --> 16:11.469
Like you were
supposed to instead of

16:11.471 --> 16:13.338
To happy hour
with a married man,

16:13.340 --> 16:15.139
You wouldn't be here
for me to worry about,
either.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.207
Yeah, well,
then I'd just be

16:16.209 --> 16:17.775
Home worrying
about you, so,

16:17.777 --> 16:19.377
Who wins, huh?

16:19.379 --> 16:20.611
[dennis sighs]

16:20.679 --> 16:23.381
My daughter's pissed for
missing her soccer game.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.383
How do you explain
to a 9-year-old

16:25.385 --> 16:27.085
That you're trapped
inside a city?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.586
There are worse
things to explain

16:28.588 --> 16:29.654
To a 9-year-old.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.494
Ok. I divided
everything we have
into 3,

16:36.496 --> 16:38.663
Based on a balanced
caloric intake.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.998
We have 30 hours left.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.933
We eat on a schedule.
Only what's allotted.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.002
[knocking on window]

16:48.674 --> 16:49.741
Man: Hey, y'all.

16:49.743 --> 16:50.775
Jana: Tony.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.844
I slept in the car.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.212
You got anything to eat?

16:58.450 --> 17:01.252
[beeping]

17:04.023 --> 17:05.757
Jake, finally.
What the hell, man?

17:05.759 --> 17:06.824
Jake: You're
volunteering me?

17:06.826 --> 17:08.292
First you get me
trapped in here,

17:08.294 --> 17:10.495
And now I get to play
evidence clerk
for the doctors?

17:10.497 --> 17:11.796
Did you call me
to yell at me?

17:11.798 --> 17:12.797
Yeah. You got
a problem with that?

17:12.799 --> 17:14.365
Yeah. A hello
would be nice.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.933
No, you don't get
a hello, all right?

17:15.935 --> 17:18.369
You're--you're
safe and sound
outside those fences,

17:18.371 --> 17:20.905
And I'm stuck in this--
this hospital of death

17:20.907 --> 17:23.841
Looking for ways to
contact next of kin.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.643
Lex: Jana's
inside too, jake.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.547
-Where?
-Work.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.015
They have sanitized
rooms there

17:31.017 --> 17:32.683
For the computers
they fix.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.018
Yeah, lucky her.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.420
Me, I'm in the running

17:35.422 --> 17:37.588
To be a baby-sitter
for a bunch of
fifth-graders.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.123
What, do you have
kids in there with you?

17:39.125 --> 17:41.859
Yeah. Field trip.
Hey, listen.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.028
The guy I brought in--
patient zero.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.463
His whole family's
in here dying.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.898
Right? It kind of
makes you wonder

17:46.900 --> 17:48.966
What type of person
would infect their
whole family

17:48.968 --> 17:50.501
Just to kill a bunch
of americans.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.473
Damn it.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.475
Lex: What's wrong?

17:58.610 --> 18:00.144
I'm-I'm looking
at this kid's phone.

18:00.212 --> 18:01.979
The--the teenage son.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.247
He's got some photos from when

18:03.249 --> 18:05.249
Patient zero came to town
3 days ago, nice

18:05.251 --> 18:07.218
Pictures of the family reunion.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.922
And then a new picture
with some random white girl

18:10.924 --> 18:12.523
Who's not here in isolation.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.425
The doctors
missed someone.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.427
[coughing]

18:22.034 --> 18:24.235
[gasping]

18:29.441 --> 18:30.942
Man: What do we do
when they find her?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.243
We scan the boy's yearbook,

18:32.245 --> 18:35.079
Facebook, facial recognition,
social media.

18:35.147 --> 18:36.714
We're uploading video
surveillance images

18:36.716 --> 18:37.949
From his high school.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.718
I've got someone dialing
every number in his phone.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.621
Her t-shirt.
That's a coffee house
in little five points.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.089
Got someone en route.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.090
That's outside
the cordon.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.692
That doesn't mean she is.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.294
Well, if she is,
then she's infected.
This whole city--

18:50.296 --> 18:52.797
Let's not jump to any
dangerous conclusions.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.433
Lex: Look, we don't know that
she's outside the cordon.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.802
Let me and my team
do our job.

18:59.104 --> 19:01.205
What's her name?

19:01.207 --> 19:04.876
Look at me. Hey!
[knocking] kid.

19:04.878 --> 19:07.145
Woman: Hold up.
Leave him alone.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.279
What's her name?

19:08.281 --> 19:10.281
You fbi, you
homeland security

19:10.283 --> 19:11.382
With all
your questions.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.850
You're not gonna
have nothing.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.552
My family
is innocent.

19:15.854 --> 19:18.156
[speaking
arabic]

19:18.158 --> 19:19.991
No, no, don't start.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.226
All right? Your nephew
brought this into the country

19:22.228 --> 19:24.829
And your son is responsible
for spreading it.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.131
[speaking arabic]

19:27.133 --> 19:28.633
Just tell me
who the girl is!

19:28.635 --> 19:33.337
We don't know her!
[coughing]

19:33.339 --> 19:38.743
[woman speaking arabic]

19:40.112 --> 19:42.647
He didn't tell us
about her.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.749
We wouldn't
have approved.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.162
[banging]

19:58.164 --> 19:59.864
Honey.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.199
When I say
come to a party,

20:01.201 --> 20:03.568
I mean come to
a party.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.203
We're not supposed
to touch.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.505
Ha ha! Tell that
to toby.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.806
I came to
kidnap you.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.608
If you're not gonna
run away with xander,

20:10.610 --> 20:12.643
Then you can run away
to toby's with me.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.212
The party's
still going?

20:14.279 --> 20:16.214
Yeah. You're
missing out.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.715
My mom'll never
go for it.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.283
Your mom's got
dollar signs growing

20:19.285 --> 20:20.685
Out of her head
like devil horns.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.221
She's busy.
We'll sneak out back.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.189
All our friends
are there.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.490
In a month, you're
gonna be a mom

20:26.492 --> 20:28.125
And your life will
be over anyway.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.860
Live a little while
you still can.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.964
[telephone ringing]

20:32.966 --> 20:34.498
I'll catch up with you.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.733
[sigh]

20:35.735 --> 20:38.836
[telephone ringing]
mm! You're so boring!

20:40.138 --> 20:41.872
[sigh]

20:41.874 --> 20:42.940
[beep]

20:45.811 --> 20:47.144
Hi, grandpa.

20:47.212 --> 20:48.946
Lex: Let me know when
you get something.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.481
Yeah. Bye.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.385
You're my new
stalker, aren't you?

20:54.387 --> 20:56.053
I hear you're looking
for a girl.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.054
No comment.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.222
A lot of people
in danger

20:58.224 --> 20:59.690
If she's sick
outside the cordon.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.260
A lot of people in
danger if she's sick,
period.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.495
How'd you know?

21:04.497 --> 21:06.197
I still have connections
in a lot of places

21:06.199 --> 21:07.999
From the days when
people actually liked me.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.935
You're welcome,
by the way.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.236
For the piece.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.605
Oh, you think I'm
looking for validation?

21:14.607 --> 21:16.707
I'm just doing my job.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.509
You know, I asked
public health pr

21:18.511 --> 21:20.411
For a one-on-one
with you and they said no.

21:20.479 --> 21:21.846
But I don't really
care because you're

21:21.848 --> 21:24.482
Clearly just part of
their machine, aren't you?

21:24.484 --> 21:25.850
You go wherever
they want you to go.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.219
You say exactly what
they want you to say.

21:28.221 --> 21:30.087
Maybe they respect
your policing.

21:30.089 --> 21:32.456
Maybe what they
really like

21:32.458 --> 21:36.160
Is having a black man
as their mouthpiece

21:36.162 --> 21:38.996
While they lay the blame
at the feet of the middle east.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.466
So, last night I'm a hero
but today, I'm the enemy.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.168
No, last night I thought
maybe you were

21:44.170 --> 21:45.536
One of the good guys.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.805
Good guys get a lot of
clicks in these situations.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.740
Villains, too, but
no, I've decided

21:49.742 --> 21:51.776
That you're not really
good or bad.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.577
I think you're
just theirs.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.379
And in my experience,
where there's a mouthpiece,

21:55.381 --> 21:57.081
There's a secret.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.215
My guy at homeland
tells me that

21:58.217 --> 21:59.984
Syria has denied
any awareness

21:59.986 --> 22:00.818
Of sayid nassir.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.820
Even isis won't
take credit.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.789
It's kind of hard to
call this bioterrorism

22:04.791 --> 22:06.991
Without any terrorists,
don't you think?

22:06.993 --> 22:09.026
Did anyone bring you
into the loop on that?

22:09.028 --> 22:11.929
[scoffs]
major mouthpiece.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.000
Major.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.735
We've got an address
for the blonde girl.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.003
It's outside the cordon.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.717
[doorbell rings]

22:40.292 --> 22:41.692
Sir, I'm
major carnahan

22:41.694 --> 22:43.661
With the atlanta
p.D., zone 6.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.629
Is your daughter
elizabeth on the premises?

22:45.631 --> 22:46.731
You don't know
where she is?

22:46.733 --> 22:47.732
No, sir.
I was hoping you

22:47.734 --> 22:49.166
Would help me out
with that.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.302
Well, we've tried
to get through
to the police,

22:51.304 --> 22:52.570
But all the circuits
are overloaded,

22:52.572 --> 22:54.538
And my--my wife has
been waiting in line

22:54.540 --> 22:56.107
At zone 5 all day.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.108
Why?

22:57.110 --> 22:59.110
Because our daughter didn't

22:59.177 --> 23:00.511
Come home last night.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.515
Lex: Elizabeth franklin, 15.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.183
We've tracked all
calls and texts

23:06.185 --> 23:08.152
Until approximately
5:00 yesterday,

23:08.154 --> 23:09.253
Before the fences went up.

23:09.255 --> 23:10.621
At which point we must assume

23:10.623 --> 23:13.257
Either a dead battery or
a power-down of the phone.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.725
Video surveillance
picked her up

23:14.727 --> 23:16.227
From her last known location.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.863
We're in the process of tracing
her steps from there.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.798
As of now, her movements
have remained

23:20.800 --> 23:22.767
Within the boundaries
of the cordon.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.301
Our men have been
given a special alert

23:24.303 --> 23:27.838
With instruction not to approach
her without protection.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.876
There. That car.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.145
Man: White honda civic.
Georgia plate

23:34.212 --> 23:37.681
Apple victor baker, 5 9 6 4.

23:37.683 --> 23:40.785
Lex: Wherever the driver is,
they're at risk, too.

23:53.331 --> 23:54.532
They stopped.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.668
That building.

23:57.670 --> 24:00.237
That's midtown.
8:34,

24:00.239 --> 24:01.505
After the fences went up.

24:01.507 --> 24:02.940
She's still inside the cordon.

24:02.942 --> 24:03.841
[crowd sighing]

24:03.843 --> 24:05.509
Lex: Keep your relief
to yourself.

24:05.577 --> 24:06.977
If she's infected,
things inside

24:06.979 --> 24:08.946
Are about to take
a very bad turn.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.348
Meese, I need
real-time images.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.583
I'm on it, major.

24:13.819 --> 24:15.486
Big brother
is watching.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.121
Times like this,
aren't you glad?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.122
It's up, major.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.159
The car's still there.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.495
Keep watching
from last night.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.097
Tell me if that girl
leaves that building.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.300
Sir, we need to get
a team in there now.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.701
Lommers: Not from outside.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.703
No one in, no one out.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.505
Send your men
from inside.

24:35.907 --> 24:37.842
You're determined to get me
killed in here, aren't you?

24:37.844 --> 24:41.879
Lex: I know, I know.
Take medical assistance
with you.

24:41.947 --> 24:44.782
Protect yourself.
And jake,

24:44.784 --> 24:47.651
We need to know if
she's symptomatic.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.954
I'm real psyched
about this. Truly.

24:51.456 --> 24:52.690
[beep]

24:54.226 --> 24:56.794
Savage on tv: At approximately
4:30 p.M. Yesterday,

24:56.796 --> 24:59.997
Sayid nassir, the man believed
to be patient zero,

24:59.999 --> 25:02.032
Died at atlanta
midtown hospital.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.869
Tragically, the physician
who initially treated nassir

25:04.871 --> 25:07.238
Died shortly after that,
along with another man

25:07.240 --> 25:08.405
Who was in
the hospital as well.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.107
Their names have yet
to be released.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.209
Health officials remain
deeply concerned...

25:12.277 --> 25:14.578
Miss frank.
They said you
wanted to see me.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.113
It's katie, please.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.552
Sorry, I'm not
being nosy.

25:21.554 --> 25:22.553
They told me
to wait in here.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.622
No problem.

25:24.624 --> 25:28.125
I needed an office, so,
they put me in here.

25:29.928 --> 25:32.963
My students and the
rest of us in the old wing,

25:32.965 --> 25:35.032
We were wondering, when
the 48 hours is up,

25:35.034 --> 25:37.401
Who has the authority
to release us?

25:37.403 --> 25:39.637
If we believe
the danger is over,

25:39.639 --> 25:42.473
My associates
at the cdc and I
will make that call.

25:42.475 --> 25:43.707
"if"?

25:44.876 --> 25:45.910
When.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.651
Dr. Cannerts...

25:55.020 --> 25:58.255
On the tv, it said
that the syrian man died

25:58.257 --> 25:59.857
Before the other victims,

25:59.859 --> 26:01.926
But I saw their bodies
in the old wing

26:01.928 --> 26:03.861
While the other man
was still alive.

26:05.130 --> 26:08.065
Everyone's immune
system is different.

26:08.067 --> 26:12.202
Mr. Nassir's body simply
fought a longer battle.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.174
Hmm.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.776
28 hours and counting.

26:18.843 --> 26:20.878
Guess we could get
some work done.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.379
Mckinley corp's
hard drives

26:22.381 --> 26:23.847
Need some love.

26:23.849 --> 26:26.784
Yeah, I'll get right
on that, dennis.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.186
Suzy: What did lex do
to piss off leo greene?

26:33.058 --> 26:36.093
Jana: National hero
or government stooge? Ouch.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.195
Suzy: Yeah. Check it out.
Leo's got someone
on the inside

26:38.197 --> 26:39.263
Getting video for him.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.769

look after her kids.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.068
So, how are you holding up?

28:24.070 --> 28:25.402
Micheline: Oh, I'm

28:25.404 --> 28:27.771
Can't tear my eyes

28:27.773 --> 28:29.540
Bert: Don't open the door

28:29.542 --> 28:30.708
To anyone.

28:30.775 --> 28:32.576
My secret lover
the mailman

28:32.578 --> 28:34.144
Will be sorely
disappointed

28:34.146 --> 28:37.548
To be turned away.
[chuckles]

28:37.550 --> 28:39.149
You just be safe, my love

28:40.852 --> 28:43.353
Woman on tv: The virus is spread
through bodily fluids,

28:43.355 --> 28:45.189
Such as saliva and mucus.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.257
If you believe
you've been exposed,

28:47.259 --> 28:49.126
It is imperative you do not
[thump]

28:49.128 --> 28:51.261
Come into contact with anyone.

28:51.263 --> 28:54.732
Our doctors and nurses are
conducting preliminary screening

28:54.734 --> 28:57.735
And will be with you
as soon as possible.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.604
Please be patient.

29:00.606 --> 29:01.705
[continues indistinctly]

29:01.707 --> 29:02.706
[clatter]

29:02.708 --> 29:04.141
Woman on tv: ...Flu outbreak,

29:04.209 --> 29:06.677
Please visit your local
urgent care center
[thump]

29:06.679 --> 29:08.746
Located inside the cordon.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.949
You can...
[clattering]

29:13.351 --> 29:14.351
[both gasp]

29:14.353 --> 29:15.986
Oh, my god.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.856
Grandma, holy crap.
You scared me.

29:18.858 --> 29:23.527
Teresa, I thought
you were a zombie.
[giggles]

29:26.664 --> 29:28.332
Grandpa caught me just in time.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.033
Aimee was trying to get me
to go to a party

29:30.035 --> 29:31.468
And mom's so slammed
at the store,

29:31.470 --> 29:33.237
You wouldn't
have had anyone
to bring you l--

29:33.239 --> 29:34.671
Woman on tv: We've been
told by authorities

29:34.673 --> 29:35.973
That several teens
found partying...

29:35.975 --> 29:37.407
Micheline:
Are you all right?

29:37.475 --> 29:39.143
Woman on tv: ...Located
within the cordon have been...

29:39.145 --> 29:40.477
Yeah, sorry.
It's just--

29:40.479 --> 29:42.479
Woman on tv: ...Infected
by the deadly virus.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.714
The news.

29:43.716 --> 29:45.082
It's horrible, isn't it?

29:45.084 --> 29:48.852
Endless talk about snot
and mucus and terrorists.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.654
I remember smallpox,
of course.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.589
That was the thing.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.958
And tuberculosis.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.127
Did you know your
actual grandfather

29:57.129 --> 29:59.463
Spent a whole year
in the sanitarium

29:59.465 --> 30:00.497
When we were children?

30:00.499 --> 30:02.266
A year.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.802
Lucky he eventually
passed before

30:04.804 --> 30:06.103
Bert walked into
my life

30:06.105 --> 30:08.872
Or I'd have left
a sick man

30:08.874 --> 30:11.408
For my new husband.
[chuckles]

30:17.048 --> 30:18.782
Woman on tv: ...Should
immediately be taken...

30:18.784 --> 30:20.784
I, um, messed up
the sandwich order.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.052
I'll send mom back
with the new ones.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.253
Oh, no, no, no.
It's all right, honey.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.389
I don't mind.
Love you, grandma.

30:25.391 --> 30:26.590
[door closes]

30:26.592 --> 30:27.691
Katie: Is that
your wife?

30:27.693 --> 30:29.660
Yeah. 30 years
next month.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.995
You got anybody
outside you're
worried about?

30:31.997 --> 30:35.332
Just people I'm
happy to dodge.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.334
[telephone ringing]

30:39.504 --> 30:40.871
Speak of the devil.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.539
Do you mind?

30:42.541 --> 30:43.607
[mouths word]

30:45.577 --> 30:47.377
Hi, grace.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.612
No, no word.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.416
No, like I said,
there's nothing I could--

30:54.519 --> 30:55.619
Yes, of course.

30:57.255 --> 30:58.255
Quentin.

31:01.759 --> 31:03.126
Grandma!

31:03.995 --> 31:06.763
Yeah. I'm good.

31:06.765 --> 31:08.365
Jake: Count has the party
as high as 30.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.435
Lex, I mean, they'd been
playing spin the bottle
in there.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.136
There's no telling where
these kids went.

31:13.138 --> 31:14.938
I mean, who they came
into contact with.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.007
There's 4,000 people
locked in the cordon.

31:17.075 --> 31:19.109
This thing is
out there, lex.
It's out.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.477
Look, you won't
believe the kind of

31:20.479 --> 31:22.646
High-tech tracking stuff
they've got in here.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.382
Eis is on it.
They're gonna
find the kids,

31:25.384 --> 31:26.850
Then they'll
trace the exposures,

31:26.852 --> 31:28.719
Which will shut down
the spread of the virus.

31:28.721 --> 31:29.987
Yeah, and what if
they can't?

31:29.989 --> 31:31.388
I can't think like that
right now, jake,

31:31.390 --> 31:33.657
And you damn sure can't
think like that, either.

31:33.659 --> 31:34.658
Lommers: Major.

31:37.428 --> 31:38.428
Gotta go.

31:47.538 --> 31:49.673
Damn it! Damn it!

31:52.610 --> 31:54.578
Aah!

31:54.580 --> 31:55.579
Hey!

31:57.215 --> 31:58.415
I got 11-year-olds
in there

31:58.417 --> 32:00.183
Holding it together
better than you.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.619
Rein it in.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.100
Cannerts: I'm afraid gphd
has had 4 new calls

32:17.102 --> 32:19.269
About potentially
symptomatic patients.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.371
3 are students who
were at that party.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.907
One the driver of the vehicle
in question.

32:23.975 --> 32:25.375
That's in addition
to the 3 students

32:25.377 --> 32:27.311
Already targeted for isolation.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.146
Lommers:
And the original exposed?

32:29.148 --> 32:31.748
Cannerts: The syrian family
has lost two of the 5,

32:31.750 --> 32:35.052
And of the others,
only the fifth-grade girl
remains healthy.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.420
Lommers: Was she exposed?

32:36.422 --> 32:38.422
If she's immune,
that's a breakthrough.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.557
Cannerts: I'm afraid
it was merely hay fever,

32:40.559 --> 32:42.326
As her guardian suspected.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.961
We'll release her
to his custody

32:43.963 --> 32:45.462
At the end of
the isolation period.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.331
It won't be long now
for the rest.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.703
Man: â™ª I'll boil
easier than you â™ª

32:52.705 --> 32:55.906
â™ª crush my bones into glue

32:55.908 --> 32:58.041
â™ª I'm a go-getter

33:03.314 --> 33:06.550
â™ª the system's in red

33:06.552 --> 33:09.319
-â™ª the room is inbred
man in hazmat suit:
Ma'am, this way.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.221
Man: â™ª I'm a go-getter

33:16.094 --> 33:21.198
-â™ª don't hold no harm
toby: Sorry.
I'm sorry, aimee.

33:23.201 --> 33:24.968
Man: â™ª don't hold

33:24.970 --> 33:27.170
[breathing heavily]

33:29.907 --> 33:35.479
Man: â™ª don't hold

33:35.481 --> 33:37.447
Man in hazmat suit: It's for
your own safety, ma'am.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.449
[gasping]

33:42.720 --> 33:49.292
Man: â™ª don't hold
[screaming]

33:49.294 --> 33:52.896
Man: â™ª don't hold

33:52.898 --> 33:54.731
We can't trace
all these people.

33:56.601 --> 33:59.436
Until the virus dies out,
we can't break the cordon.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.507
Yeah. Ok, fine.

34:03.574 --> 34:05.709
But how do we get
the healthy
people out?

34:12.517 --> 34:13.750
We don't.

34:21.959 --> 34:23.226
[sirens wailing,
horns honking]

34:23.228 --> 34:24.694
Tomorrow you can
alert the parents

34:24.696 --> 34:25.695
Who live
within the cordon

34:25.697 --> 34:27.330
To come
for their kids.

34:27.332 --> 34:29.132
The quarantine
is over?

34:29.134 --> 34:31.168
The hospital
lockdown is over.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.570
City quarantine
has been extended.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.639
With the virus
confirmed beyond
these walls,

34:35.641 --> 34:38.041
They can't tell
when we can end
the cordon.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.342
I'm sorry.

34:45.283 --> 34:47.851
Where will you go?

34:47.853 --> 34:51.221
Zone 6 has a small
satellite office
inside the cordon.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.656
I can stay there.

34:52.658 --> 34:53.557
Oh. Good.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.826
-And you?
-My place is outside.

34:55.828 --> 34:57.227
Quentin's
grandparents, too.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.228
Plus, I have
other kids

34:58.230 --> 35:00.497
Who may be
stuck here, so...

35:00.499 --> 35:02.532
I guess this is
home for a while.

35:04.202 --> 35:06.203
Cannerts has my number

35:06.205 --> 35:08.305
If you run into
any trouble.

35:08.307 --> 35:11.208
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ok.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.115
[sigh]

35:19.917 --> 35:21.451
I'm sorry about earlier.

35:23.221 --> 35:26.957
Sometimes when
I'm, uh, upset,

35:26.959 --> 35:28.692
I let anger get
the best of me.

35:30.094 --> 35:31.828
I know the type.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.130
I had a kid
with one.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.670
Those kids, they'll be
looking to you, you know?

35:40.672 --> 35:42.539
They want to believe
you can protect them.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.310
You sound like
my buddy lex.

35:48.246 --> 35:49.613
Always trying to
make me a good guy

35:49.615 --> 35:51.581
No matter what I did
to convince him
otherwise.

35:52.884 --> 35:55.852
Well. You take care.

36:03.961 --> 36:06.229
[sighs]

36:07.532 --> 36:08.798
[exhales]

36:12.904 --> 36:14.905
[rattling]

36:32.089 --> 36:33.290
I can stay.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.294
Do you need help
with the kids?

36:38.930 --> 36:39.963
I'll stay.

36:41.265 --> 36:42.699
I'm staying.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.705
It's all over the internet.
All those sick kids.

36:48.773 --> 36:50.407
Lex: You need to stop
reading that stuff.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.908
It's a bunch of
conspiracy theories

36:51.910 --> 36:54.044
And unconfirmed gossip.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.813
How much longer are they
gonna extend the quarantine?

36:56.815 --> 36:58.748
I don't know.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.717
Not long, just--

37:00.719 --> 37:02.385
They just need to know
for sure.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.854
I'm so stupid.
Suzy was right.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.923
If I had just told
my head to stop
spinning yesterday

37:06.925 --> 37:08.291
And packed up
that moving van.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.026
But your spinning head
is one of the things

37:10.028 --> 37:11.761
That I love most
about you.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.564
-Don't lie.
-It's top 10 at least.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.400
You're still lying.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.473
Jana, you understand
there's some things
about the cordon

37:23.541 --> 37:25.275
I'm not gonna be
able to tell you.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.344
Like what?

37:27.346 --> 37:28.912
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.715
I'm just doing my job.

37:34.118 --> 37:35.552
Like what, lex?

37:35.554 --> 37:36.820
I'll call you later.

37:38.856 --> 37:39.856
[beep]

37:45.363 --> 37:47.330
She's not gonna like
what's about to happen.

37:48.132 --> 37:49.499
No one is.

37:54.739 --> 37:56.773
Man on p.A.: Call the georgia
department of public health.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.241
Do you know where
aimee got infected?

37:58.243 --> 37:59.909
[voice shaking]
I don't know anything.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.244
She kissed me.

38:01.246 --> 38:03.046
Did you see the news?

38:03.048 --> 38:04.547
They're sick, xander.

38:06.384 --> 38:09.853
My friends.
They're all gonna die.

38:10.921 --> 38:12.222
What if I'm--

38:12.224 --> 38:14.658
T, listen to me.
You are gonna be ok.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.859
All right?
You stay locked up

38:15.861 --> 38:17.794
And you don't let
anyone near you.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.929
A-and, baby, you gotta
try to stop crying.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.631
I-if you cry, we won't
be able to tell

38:21.633 --> 38:23.800
If your nose is running from
the tears or from the plague.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.502
[laughs]

38:25.504 --> 38:27.437
Xander, the baby.

38:28.739 --> 38:29.572
I'm coming in.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.007
Those fences can't hold me.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.909
I'm not letting you
go through this alone.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.012
[beeping]
wait.

38:37.415 --> 38:38.515
Suzy: Thanks for
letting me into

38:38.517 --> 38:40.817
The queen's
private quarters.

38:41.752 --> 38:43.353
I didn't mean
to shut you out.

38:43.355 --> 38:44.554
I just--

38:45.556 --> 38:47.357
Lex has me
scared, ok?

38:49.327 --> 38:50.860
I promise not
to breathe on you.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.430
Sooz, I'm glad
you're here.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.599
I mean, I'd rather
you be on the outside,

38:56.601 --> 38:58.034
But if we're
gonna be stuck...

38:59.270 --> 39:00.603
I'm glad we're together.

39:01.939 --> 39:04.607
Hey, we've been
through hell together
once already.

39:04.609 --> 39:07.010
Second time'll be
a breeze, right?

39:07.012 --> 39:10.013
[clattering]

39:11.782 --> 39:14.050
Where do you think
my birth mother is
right now?

39:14.052 --> 39:15.885
[chuckles]

39:15.887 --> 39:19.155
Uh, she's...

39:19.157 --> 39:22.459
Staring down
at us from

39:22.461 --> 39:24.194
The international
space station,

39:24.196 --> 39:27.864
Where she was sent
to teach astronauts
geo-physics.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.866
Nice.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.968
She's a smart
cookie, my mama.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.536
[clattering]

39:33.538 --> 39:34.771
Where's mine?

39:34.839 --> 39:35.839
Hmm?
