00:03.309 --> 00:04.935
Previously on <i>Future Man...</i>

00:04.936 --> 00:06.186
I'm gonna run this through

00:06.187 --> 00:09.397
every DNA database in the world.

00:09.398 --> 00:10.941
I'm coming for you.

00:10.942 --> 00:12.108
Okay, this is my life.

00:12.109 --> 00:13.401
Leave me the fuck alone.

00:13.402 --> 00:15.487
We got three bio slags

00:15.488 --> 00:17.030
and an asset to interrogate.

00:17.031 --> 00:19.157
The kill team is going
to descend on this house.

00:19.158 --> 00:21.159
They will hunt you down and find you,

00:21.160 --> 00:22.494
no matter where you are.

00:22.495 --> 00:23.787
All right, we use our last jump,

00:23.788 --> 00:25.247
we go back, we kill baby Kronish.

00:25.248 --> 00:26.414
That is the new mission.

00:26.415 --> 00:28.166
Absolutely not, you cannot kill a baby.

00:28.167 --> 00:30.210
You just find out when
and where Kronish was born,

00:30.211 --> 00:31.711
we'll take care of the rest.

00:31.712 --> 00:34.423
Consider your savior
duties complete, Future Man.

00:38.010 --> 00:40.303
What's happening?

00:40.304 --> 00:43.181
Feels like my dick's getting ripped off!

00:46.602 --> 00:48.020
Shit.

00:49.313 --> 00:50.690
What was that?

00:52.525 --> 00:54.567
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:54.568 --> 00:55.860
Where's your scar?

00:58.030 --> 01:00.282
Whoa.

01:00.283 --> 01:02.659
It's on your arm!

01:02.660 --> 01:03.702
God.

01:05.538 --> 01:06.955
Where's mine?

01:06.956 --> 01:08.915
What the?

01:11.544 --> 01:12.544
It's the Cameronium.

01:12.545 --> 01:13.920
It's unstable in its raw form.

01:13.921 --> 01:15.964
Our bodies got scrambled in the jump.

01:15.965 --> 01:16.924
Was that all?

01:16.925 --> 01:18.133
You had a rough 10 minutes.

01:18.134 --> 01:20.136
First you die, and then this.

01:21.304 --> 01:23.722
Let's just say you're initiated.

01:23.723 --> 01:24.931
Really?

01:27.101 --> 01:28.893
All right.

01:28.894 --> 01:30.353
Let's hop to it.

01:31.856 --> 01:34.858
Wait, wait, wait, stop.

01:34.859 --> 01:36.027
What?

01:37.570 --> 01:40.071
Holy shit, this dick is huge!

01:40.072 --> 01:42.073
- What's this thing?
- It's so hairy.

01:42.074 --> 01:43.742
That is a pathetic cock.

01:43.743 --> 01:45.285
It's lacking its warrior's mane.

01:45.286 --> 01:48.079
My God, the girth.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.373
Give me back my dick,
you fucking cock pirate.

01:50.374 --> 01:53.001
- Go fire up the TTD, we gotta jump again.
- No. No. No!

01:53.002 --> 01:54.461
No, we are not jumping again.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.712
Well, that's easy for you to say,

01:55.713 --> 01:57.089
you still got your vag.

01:59.008 --> 02:00.717
- Yeah, we're good.
- See?

02:00.718 --> 02:02.594
No, we're not... it's too dangerous.

02:02.595 --> 02:04.763
I mean, what could be next,
our hearts, our brains?

02:04.764 --> 02:06.599
I don't care. I want my dick back.

02:07.642 --> 02:09.559
How do you walk with this thing?

02:12.813 --> 02:15.190
So that's what corpses smell like.

02:15.191 --> 02:17.192
What a waste of deviled eggs.

02:17.193 --> 02:20.445
Anyone else not in
the mood to chop bodies up?

02:20.446 --> 02:21.488
No.

02:23.407 --> 02:24.991
We've come a long way.

02:24.992 --> 02:27.452
Almost there, just one more mission.

02:27.453 --> 02:30.789
Get us that date,
we'll take care of the rest.

02:30.790 --> 02:33.291
I just can't believe it
still comes down to this.

02:33.292 --> 02:35.293
Hey, remember,

02:35.294 --> 02:37.128
you're not killing a baby.

02:37.129 --> 02:38.880
We're killing a baby.

02:38.881 --> 02:40.382
It's a first for me.

02:40.383 --> 02:41.633
Yeah, that doesn't really help.

02:41.634 --> 02:43.301
I mean, people throw terms around,

02:43.302 --> 02:44.552
like "for the greater good,"

02:44.553 --> 02:47.263
but I just feel sick to my stomach.

02:47.264 --> 02:49.724
That probably means
your humanity's intact.

02:49.725 --> 02:51.142
Congratulations.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:49.702 --> 03:51.661
Wise words from Corey Hart.

03:51.662 --> 03:53.830
We'd all do well to heed them.

03:53.831 --> 03:55.623
You're not bringing anything?

03:55.624 --> 03:57.208
Intense focus,

03:57.209 --> 03:59.377
sense of purpose,

03:59.378 --> 04:01.921
shutter blade.

04:01.922 --> 04:03.548
Why do you need that?

04:03.549 --> 04:05.884
Moruga scorpion?

04:05.885 --> 04:08.219
It's only the world's
spiciest chili powder.

04:08.220 --> 04:09.721
Don't eat it if you're not interested

04:09.722 --> 04:11.264
in shitting blood.

04:11.265 --> 04:13.391
Man, when you're in a jam,

04:13.392 --> 04:15.977
a pinch of this will save the dish.

04:15.978 --> 04:20.106
Okay, we're not here
to pleasure scavenge.

04:20.107 --> 04:21.524
Return this junk to Gabe.

04:21.524 --> 04:23.401
That's my keep sack.

04:23.402 --> 04:24.903
That's my return sack.

04:24.904 --> 04:26.738
We're not keeping anything.

04:26.739 --> 04:28.531
Okay, these things,
they're not our things,

04:28.532 --> 04:29.949
and as much as you
might want them to be,

04:29.950 --> 04:32.244
these people, they're not our people.

04:34.789 --> 04:37.874
I... I just wanna bring my cookbook.

04:37.875 --> 04:40.210
The only thing we're bringing back

04:40.211 --> 04:41.753
is our team.

04:41.754 --> 04:44.380
It's a mistake to think
we have any connection

04:44.381 --> 04:47.550
to this time.

04:47.551 --> 04:48.843
Dump it out.

04:54.350 --> 04:56.184
The future we're going back to, Wolf,

04:56.185 --> 04:59.062
it is going to have all this and more.

04:59.063 --> 05:02.023
Imagine plump cats,
not just on Festivus,

05:02.024 --> 05:03.650
but every meal.

05:03.651 --> 05:06.569
Okay, different pairs of socks
for each day of the week.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.781
Water the color of fresh tea.

05:09.782 --> 05:12.158
Electricity.

05:12.159 --> 05:13.618
After we kill this baby,

05:13.619 --> 05:15.537
the only thing you're ever
gonna have to kill again

05:15.538 --> 05:17.288
is rampaging alligators, and it will not

05:17.289 --> 05:19.791
be for survival,

05:19.792 --> 05:21.126
it'll be for sport.

05:23.295 --> 05:24.504
Okay?

05:24.505 --> 05:26.923
Grab your return sack and let's go.

05:46.026 --> 05:47.277
Hey, Dr. Kronish.

05:47.278 --> 05:49.696
Futterman, what are you doing here?

05:49.697 --> 05:50.905
Working.

05:50.906 --> 05:53.199
I gave everyone the week off.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.618
Thanks to our holiday party debacle,

05:55.619 --> 05:58.162
half the office is still hospitalized.

06:00.332 --> 06:02.292
Are you okay?

06:02.293 --> 06:04.878
Stu is suing me
for wrongful termination,

06:04.879 --> 06:07.380
Marigold's got me sleeping on the couch,

06:07.381 --> 06:10.049
and to top it off,

06:10.050 --> 06:13.845
my house is in the path
of the Loma Linda Fire.

06:13.846 --> 06:15.013
The what?

06:15.014 --> 06:17.682
Where did it go wrong, Futterman?

06:17.683 --> 06:19.267
It's all gonna be over soon.

06:19.268 --> 06:21.019
Not soon enough.

06:21.020 --> 06:22.937
Well, it might be hard
for you to understand,

06:22.938 --> 06:24.564
you're a young man.

06:24.565 --> 06:26.316
What is our age difference?

06:26.317 --> 06:28.276
I'm 23 and you're...

06:28.277 --> 06:30.695
Too old for this shit.

06:30.696 --> 06:31.988
I was like you once,

06:31.989 --> 06:34.617
full of hopes and dreams.

06:36.577 --> 06:38.870
I was quite a dancer back in the day.

06:38.871 --> 06:40.538
You don't say?

06:40.539 --> 06:42.373
That dancing, where...
where would you say

06:42.374 --> 06:43.541
you picked that up?

06:43.542 --> 06:45.710
- On the streets of...
- Hard knocks.

06:45.711 --> 06:49.589
Hard knocks California
or like hard knocks Chicago.

06:49.590 --> 06:51.924
Hawthorne, born and raised.

06:51.925 --> 06:55.219
But I... I gave up on the dancing,

06:55.220 --> 06:56.597
gave up on a lot of things.

06:59.433 --> 07:02.352
I was in love once.

07:02.353 --> 07:04.896
Many, many years ago.

07:04.897 --> 07:06.648
- With Marigold?
- No.

07:06.649 --> 07:09.984
That is, as it's always been,

07:09.985 --> 07:11.611
a loveless relationship.

07:11.612 --> 07:13.738
I'm pretty sure she cheated on me.

07:13.739 --> 07:17.117
And I too was tempted
by the fruit of another.

07:20.037 --> 07:21.579
Leslie.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.710
Sweet, sweet Leslie.

07:31.090 --> 07:34.217
That boat was Leslie's
36th birthday present to me.

07:34.218 --> 07:38.262
And with it came an offer
to sail away into a new life.

07:40.432 --> 07:42.850
We were to set sail that day.

07:42.851 --> 07:45.645
So your birthday, that...
was that the summertime?

07:45.646 --> 07:47.355
I mean, you don't really embark

07:47.356 --> 07:49.065
on a journey like
that during the winter.

07:49.066 --> 07:51.651
June 24th, but you're missing the point.

07:51.652 --> 07:54.904
I could've had a little
scuba shop in the Seychelles,

07:54.905 --> 07:56.364
living a quiet life.

07:56.365 --> 07:58.157
You ever taste conch fritter, Futterman?

07:58.158 --> 08:01.077
Woo, God damn delicious.

08:01.078 --> 08:02.954
Well, you can still enjoy those.

08:02.955 --> 08:05.039
You can't get good conch in L. A.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.001
And you definitely can't find Leslie.

08:11.296 --> 08:13.297
Why didn't I listen to my heart?

08:15.509 --> 08:18.970
Now I'm just a 68yearold
quilt of regret,

08:18.971 --> 08:21.931
stitched together with
herpes and inertia.

08:24.309 --> 08:27.186
I'm just wallowing.

08:27.187 --> 08:29.273
Tomorrow, back to work.

08:30.315 --> 08:31.899
Can I take a photo with you?

08:31.900 --> 08:35.653
If it's for the World's
Greatest Boss mug, then yes.

08:35.654 --> 08:38.532
Thank you, it's a keepsake.

08:41.284 --> 08:43.202
Another one, but... but goofy.

08:43.203 --> 08:45.164
- It'll cheer us both up.
- Okay.

08:50.669 --> 08:52.837
This blaze started
in the Loma Linda area

08:52.838 --> 08:54.756
and has quickly jumped around

08:54.757 --> 08:57.300
threatening homes and neighborhoods.

08:57.301 --> 09:00.386
A spokesman for the LA Fire Department
said the cause of the blaze

09:00.387 --> 09:02.180
was unknown at the time,

09:02.181 --> 09:04.015
but they hope to have
further information

09:04.016 --> 09:05.767
later today.

09:05.768 --> 09:07.143
Mayor Garcetti is scheduled

09:07.144 --> 09:11.105
to have a press conference at
3:00pm but at the moment...

09:11.106 --> 09:14.734
Gabe, Gabe...

09:14.735 --> 09:17.653
have you been attacked?

09:17.654 --> 09:18.905
They took her.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.157
They took my cupcake.

09:21.158 --> 09:22.825
Said there was a murder,

09:22.826 --> 09:25.620
something about a cop
in 1969, some drug dealers,

09:25.621 --> 09:26.746
it didn't make any sense.

09:26.747 --> 09:29.373
- Who took her?
- The cops!

09:29.374 --> 09:30.750
They said they had her DNA,

09:30.751 --> 09:33.419
some DNA test she took,
it all happened so fast.

09:40.677 --> 09:41.803
Okay.

09:41.804 --> 09:43.137
All right, Dad, I'm gonna ask you

09:43.138 --> 09:45.306
a very important question, all right?

09:46.475 --> 09:49.018
How good looking were the cops?

09:49.019 --> 09:50.144
What?!

09:50.145 --> 09:51.354
Like, were they hot or not?

09:51.355 --> 09:53.022
On a scale of 1 to 10,

09:53.023 --> 09:55.024
were they a 9 or higher?

09:55.025 --> 09:58.528
I don't know, it's kinda
tough for me to gauge.

09:58.529 --> 10:00.154
Okay, um...

10:00.155 --> 10:04.075
Okay, who's the hottest
person you can think of?

10:04.076 --> 10:05.118
Your mother.

10:07.287 --> 10:09.247
Okay, Dad,

10:09.248 --> 10:11.457
Mom isn't here right now,

10:11.458 --> 10:13.126
you can be honest with me.

10:13.127 --> 10:14.502
Your mother is a 10.

10:14.503 --> 10:15.962
She's a 6 at best!

10:15.963 --> 10:17.255
You take that back.

10:17.256 --> 10:19.090
Dad, Dad, you... listen to me,

10:19.091 --> 10:20.550
okay, listen to me.

10:20.551 --> 10:24.470
Now, tell me, were the cops hot or not?

10:24.471 --> 10:27.682
I don't know, maybe one
of them had a certain

10:27.683 --> 10:29.433
way about them.

10:30.644 --> 10:32.061
It had to be Biotics.

10:32.062 --> 10:34.272
Guys, Jerry said
a strike team was coming.

10:34.273 --> 10:37.150
And now they've taken my mom as bait!

10:37.151 --> 10:39.318
- It's not Biotics.
- It could be.

10:39.319 --> 10:40.820
For all we know she's dead.

10:42.364 --> 10:43.489
It's okay, Gabe!

10:43.490 --> 10:44.949
You just have to replace her.

10:44.950 --> 10:46.033
Perhaps with Wanda!

10:46.034 --> 10:47.451
I don't want to replace her.

10:47.452 --> 10:49.079
She gives great blow jobs.

10:50.706 --> 10:52.498
Guys, my mom is gone,

10:52.499 --> 10:53.791
and I'm responsible for that.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.084
Okay, if we can't get her back,

10:55.085 --> 10:56.586
if something happens to her, that's...

10:56.587 --> 10:57.962
that's all my fault!

10:57.963 --> 11:00.256
I can't live with myself.

11:00.257 --> 11:02.091
We have to rescue Diane.

11:02.092 --> 11:04.177
- What?
- Look around.

11:04.178 --> 11:05.469
They welcomed us into their family,

11:05.470 --> 11:07.889
and we are just tearing it apart.

11:07.890 --> 11:09.182
What happened to forgetting these people

11:09.183 --> 11:10.641
and getting back to Festivus cats

11:10.642 --> 11:12.476
and sport gators?

11:12.477 --> 11:13.978
Give us the date.

11:13.979 --> 11:15.771
If Biotics have Diane,
the last thing we wanna do

11:15.772 --> 11:16.898
is walk into that trap.

11:16.899 --> 11:18.900
- Give me the date.
- No, no!

11:20.319 --> 11:22.153
I'll cut it out of your stomach.

11:22.154 --> 11:24.197
Wolf, stop.

11:25.324 --> 11:26.657
Fuck.

11:26.658 --> 11:28.034
I couldn't swallow it.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.327
We're going to rescue Diane.

11:29.328 --> 11:30.661
Whether it's police or it's Biotics,

11:30.662 --> 11:32.205
we are not leaving her behind,

11:32.206 --> 11:35.458
and that is the true
meaning of Festivus.

11:39.379 --> 11:40.422
What?

11:42.549 --> 11:44.675
Let me tell you a little
story about a girl

11:44.676 --> 11:48.387
named Diane, Diane.

11:48.388 --> 11:50.306
It was the '60s.

11:50.307 --> 11:52.767
A lot of ideas in the air.

11:52.768 --> 11:56.479
Some people wanted
to create a great society,

11:56.480 --> 11:59.023
some wanted to watch it burn.

11:59.024 --> 12:00.358
I was in the Peace Corps.

12:00.359 --> 12:01.984
Which is exactly where you learned

12:01.985 --> 12:03.611
to hate black people.

12:03.612 --> 12:04.779
In South America?

12:04.780 --> 12:07.031
Fine, Latinos!

12:07.032 --> 12:11.327
People with names like, I don't know,

12:11.328 --> 12:13.746
Jorge Santiago.

12:13.747 --> 12:16.123
Jorge was your partner,
the one you lost?

12:16.124 --> 12:18.000
And how would you know that?

12:18.001 --> 12:19.502
Well, you've mentioned it several times.

12:19.503 --> 12:21.462
I don't even think you
know you're doing it.

12:21.463 --> 12:24.507
I'm gonna keep doing it
until you help me add up

12:24.508 --> 12:26.008
one plus one!

12:26.009 --> 12:28.678
'Cause I keep coming up with three!

12:32.224 --> 12:34.725
You've aged magnificently, by the way.

12:34.726 --> 12:36.435
Well, that's not me.

12:36.436 --> 12:39.563
Tell that to the DNA
you left at the meth lab.

12:39.564 --> 12:42.149
It matches perfectly to the DNA

12:42.150 --> 12:45.236
that you submitted to DNYay.

12:45.237 --> 12:46.362
DNYay?

12:46.363 --> 12:47.822
Well, I never did a test.

12:47.823 --> 12:50.074
Don't lie to me, Diane.

12:50.075 --> 12:53.536
I've spent 48 years waiting for a slip.

12:53.537 --> 12:56.580
And, boy, did you hit the banana peel.

12:56.581 --> 12:59.709
Why don't we both just
take a nice, deep breath.

13:01.712 --> 13:03.379
I know it must be incredibly frustrating

13:03.380 --> 13:05.214
trying to make sense
of your partner's death,

13:05.215 --> 13:07.466
but this is all a big mistake.

13:07.467 --> 13:10.845
DNA don't lie.

13:10.846 --> 13:13.514
What's in this?

13:13.515 --> 13:15.933
Are you looking for someone?

13:15.934 --> 13:19.020
Protecting someone?

13:19.021 --> 13:21.480
Rita in San Bernardino?

13:21.481 --> 13:24.275
Gavin in Prescott, Arizona?

13:24.276 --> 13:26.736
Why do the test when you know you're on

13:26.737 --> 13:29.322
the FBI's Most Wanted list?

13:31.533 --> 13:34.618
You may want to,
pump the brakes, Detective.

13:35.954 --> 13:37.414
Excuse me.

13:40.792 --> 13:43.627
I ran the cheek swab
and it doesn't match.

13:43.628 --> 13:45.004
Impossible!

13:47.132 --> 13:49.133
Run it again.

13:49.134 --> 13:50.926
DNA don't lie.

13:56.892 --> 13:59.393
Okay, guys, let's go get Mom back.

13:59.394 --> 14:01.979
- Dead or alive.
- No, Corey, alive.

14:01.980 --> 14:03.773
Shouldn't I just call a lawyer?

14:03.774 --> 14:05.024
Dad, look, things in there

14:05.025 --> 14:06.025
might get a little bit hairy, okay?

14:06.026 --> 14:07.318
Why don't you just stay out here

14:07.319 --> 14:08.319
and keep the car running?

14:08.320 --> 14:10.029
What are you talking about?

14:10.030 --> 14:11.822
All right, guys...

14:11.823 --> 14:14.784
time to get ready for
the fight of our lives.

14:14.785 --> 14:15.826
Joshy!

14:15.827 --> 14:17.995
You all came.

14:17.996 --> 14:20.247
My God, cupcake,
I thought I'd lost you.

14:20.248 --> 14:21.957
I'm never letting go again.

14:21.958 --> 14:23.459
What has gotten into the three of you?

14:23.460 --> 14:24.960
What are you mixed up in?

14:24.961 --> 14:26.754
They have got sketches
of all of you in there,

14:26.755 --> 14:28.589
and they've got your DNA test results

14:28.590 --> 14:31.425
and a whole list of your relatives.

14:31.426 --> 14:33.677
This is... this is
my fault, Diane, okay?

14:33.678 --> 14:36.180
But you don't have to worry,
because after today,

14:36.181 --> 14:38.682
you're not gonna see us ever again.

14:38.683 --> 14:39.892
Neither is your son.

14:39.893 --> 14:42.103
Well, that's a bit extreme.

14:42.104 --> 14:44.188
I mean, I was just
telling you all of this

14:44.189 --> 14:45.773
'cause I care about you.

14:45.774 --> 14:47.525
I know you do.

14:47.526 --> 14:48.734
I do too.

14:48.735 --> 14:51.112
Let's... let's get out of here, go home.

14:51.113 --> 14:52.739
Just give us a second.

14:55.033 --> 14:56.492
Diane's secure.

14:56.493 --> 14:57.868
Now, how about that date?

15:01.331 --> 15:02.832
Guess this is goodbye.

15:02.833 --> 15:03.916
Yup.

15:05.043 --> 15:06.502
Who would've thought
that three years ago

15:06.503 --> 15:09.130
when I walked into that video game store

15:09.131 --> 15:10.965
and I saw Biotic Wars there on the shelf

15:10.966 --> 15:12.758
and I took it home
and I starting playing...

15:12.759 --> 15:14.159
What are you... what are you doing?

15:15.637 --> 15:18.722
I was building up for,
like, a heartfelt farewell.

15:18.723 --> 15:20.266
You know what, to be honest, Future Man,

15:20.267 --> 15:21.976
where we come from,
if you show up you're alive,

15:21.977 --> 15:23.269
if you don't, you're dead.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.478
Hellos and goodbyes, they kinda went

15:24.479 --> 15:26.897
the way of hygiene.

15:26.898 --> 15:29.025
I guess that's kinda consistent
with your whole deal.

15:35.448 --> 15:38.033
For you, we're gonna make this quick.

15:38.034 --> 15:39.451
Execution style.

15:39.452 --> 15:42.079
Little baby Kronish,
he's not gonna see it coming.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.126
- Bye.
- All right.

15:48.712 --> 15:51.714
So, who wants Blizzards?

15:51.715 --> 15:54.258
This isn't a Blizzard moment, honey.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.724
Hey, Gabe.

16:01.725 --> 16:04.101
Meeting you has been good,

16:04.102 --> 16:07.438
which makes it hard to say goodbye.

16:07.439 --> 16:09.106
I care about you.

16:09.107 --> 16:10.774
Really?

16:10.775 --> 16:12.818
Cock pirate.

16:12.819 --> 16:14.862
What a nice young man.

16:17.949 --> 16:21.369
So, you wanna tell us what's going on?

16:23.121 --> 16:24.788
Yeah.

16:24.789 --> 16:28.167
You know, but first, Mom,
I need to apologize to you.

16:28.168 --> 16:29.877
I was so unfair with
you the other night,

16:29.878 --> 16:32.004
and you did not deserve that.

16:32.005 --> 16:33.464
Honey.

16:33.465 --> 16:34.798
You never rebelled as a kid,

16:34.799 --> 16:36.217
so it's about time you told your parents

16:36.218 --> 16:37.343
to fuck off.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.427
I punched my dad when he tried

16:38.428 --> 16:39.678
to get me to enlist.

16:39.679 --> 16:41.222
I had no quarrel with the Viet Cong.

16:41.223 --> 16:43.224
No quarrel!

16:43.225 --> 16:46.393
But I am concerned about the meth lab.

16:46.394 --> 16:48.145
- Yeah.
- Meth lab?

16:48.146 --> 16:49.855
Someone's out of the loop.

17:02.285 --> 17:04.454
Look who's pleasure scavenging now.

17:12.837 --> 17:14.213
You took a DNA test?

17:14.214 --> 17:16.339
It was a moment of weakness.

17:16.340 --> 17:18.342
You lecture me about chili powder!

17:18.343 --> 17:21.011
Tell me these aren't our people.

17:21.012 --> 17:23.180
Who are you looking for?

17:23.181 --> 17:24.556
What are you looking for?

17:24.557 --> 17:26.599
No more questions!

17:26.601 --> 17:27.935
That's an order.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.273
You're a fucking hypocrite.

17:32.732 --> 17:35.985
I'm not the one who threw the mine

17:35.986 --> 17:37.528
that killed the cop.

17:37.529 --> 17:38.862
I didn't break the gas station

17:38.863 --> 17:41.782
attendant's fingers
bringing the biker gang

17:41.783 --> 17:45.619
to the frat house, which led to a riot.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.746
I didn't do all the meth,

17:47.747 --> 17:50.833
and then shoot up
drug dealers in the lab.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.334
You shot up some of them!

17:52.335 --> 17:56.547
Okay. We both shot up the drug dealers.

17:59.009 --> 18:01.636
Holy shit.

18:03.221 --> 18:05.765
It's time to put those demons to bed.

18:17.277 --> 18:18.944
Impossible.

18:21.406 --> 18:24.408
Just when I thought I was out,

18:24.409 --> 18:27.329
the fax machine pulls me back in.

18:30.248 --> 18:32.541
You know, I just... I thought I was

18:32.542 --> 18:35.002
doing the right thing, and...

18:35.003 --> 18:37.087
now I don't even know
what that is anymore.

18:37.088 --> 18:40.591
Joshy, do you know what's
so special about you?

18:40.592 --> 18:42.843
You never give up on anything.

18:42.844 --> 18:44.345
You're a fighter!

18:44.346 --> 18:47.139
And on top of that, you are good.

18:47.140 --> 18:50.267
You're the most loving boy
a parent could ever wish for.

18:50.268 --> 18:52.519
Whatever you're going through right now,

18:52.520 --> 18:54.938
just lead with that, okay?

18:54.939 --> 18:58.442
Follow your heart.

18:58.443 --> 19:00.527
You're right.

19:00.528 --> 19:02.071
You're right.

19:02.072 --> 19:04.948
It's time for me to be strong.

19:04.949 --> 19:06.116
What?

19:16.044 --> 19:18.088
If I'm gonna be home
after 11:00, I'll text.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.884
You are not gonna
believe what I just saw.

19:23.885 --> 19:26.261
You give me shit for
taking this much pleasure

19:26.262 --> 19:27.763
from this world.

19:27.764 --> 19:29.598
And behind my back,

19:29.599 --> 19:31.392
you're trying to become part of it?

19:33.812 --> 19:35.854
Speak of the demons.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.180
Tiger!

20:10.181 --> 20:11.265
Wolf!

20:12.517 --> 20:13.559
I knew it.

20:15.603 --> 20:17.646
Now, that's a 10.

20:19.983 --> 20:21.066
Shit.

20:58.021 --> 20:59.354
What are you doing here?

20:59.355 --> 21:00.522
What are you guys doing here?

21:00.523 --> 21:02.191
Yeah, Tiger, what are we doing here?

21:02.192 --> 21:03.567
I thought... why didn't you jump?

21:03.568 --> 21:05.652
We got TTD JJ'd... jump jammer.

21:05.653 --> 21:07.112
The Biotics are blocking our signal.

21:07.113 --> 21:08.781
Wouldn't have happened if we
left when we were supposed to.

21:08.782 --> 21:10.783
- Don't start with me.
- I'm gonna start.

21:10.784 --> 21:12.201
Then there's gonna be
a middle, then an end.

21:12.202 --> 21:13.660
- You're not gonna...
- Then you're gonna

21:13.661 --> 21:15.370
think it's over,
then I'm gonna start again.

21:15.371 --> 21:16.872
You are not gonna start again
'cause you're never gonna

21:16.873 --> 21:18.874
- start to begin with.
- Already started.

21:18.875 --> 21:20.793
- Guys!
- What are you even doing here?

21:20.794 --> 21:21.919
I'm coming with you.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.046
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

21:24.047 --> 21:25.881
I wanna see this thing to the end.

21:25.882 --> 21:28.383
Not if we don't get out of range.

21:30.136 --> 21:32.971
Maybe if you, like,
move it a couple of inches.

21:34.224 --> 21:37.768
A couple of inches don't matter...

21:37.769 --> 21:40.103
in terms of the TTD.

21:40.104 --> 21:42.606
Hey, guys, we gotta move.

21:42.607 --> 21:44.024
Don't move, don't move.

21:49.823 --> 21:51.657
Guys, don't, she can't see us.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.909
No Biotics in the police station?

21:53.910 --> 21:56.787
- I guess Tiger was wrong again.
- I wasn't wrong!

21:56.788 --> 21:58.330
They probably just followed
us here from the house.

21:58.331 --> 22:00.541
If you hadn't made me
return all my awesome stuff,

22:00.542 --> 22:01.862
that wouldn't have even happened.

22:24.399 --> 22:27.109
- Heart stab.
- Neck plunge.

22:27.110 --> 22:28.318
Great teamwork.

22:28.319 --> 22:29.570
Guys, I saw a few more out there.

22:29.571 --> 22:31.238
Smoke wave only bought us four minutes.

22:31.239 --> 22:32.614
- Let's move.
- No.

22:32.615 --> 22:34.241
We're keeping this defensive position.

22:34.242 --> 22:35.325
Tactical advantage.

22:35.326 --> 22:37.035
Bullshit, it's hardly defensive.

22:37.036 --> 22:38.078
We're outgunned and blind.

22:38.079 --> 22:39.621
We're fucking target practice.

22:39.622 --> 22:42.082
Guys, I think you're both
in defensive positions.

22:42.083 --> 22:43.709
Right, I didn't come
back here to watch you two

22:43.710 --> 22:45.210
tear each other apart.

22:45.211 --> 22:46.253
I already died for you once,

22:46.254 --> 22:47.921
I'm not doing it again.

22:47.922 --> 22:49.756
Now, listen, I'm gonna
get us out of here

22:49.757 --> 22:51.091
on my lead.

23:03.354 --> 23:06.982
Once a janitor always a janitor.

23:19.078 --> 23:20.787
- Stu?
- You know how much it cost me

23:20.788 --> 23:22.998
to get all that puke out of this coat?

23:22.999 --> 23:24.374
Two grand!

23:24.375 --> 23:26.126
Stu, I don't really
have the time right now...

23:26.127 --> 23:27.836
Shut up!

23:27.837 --> 23:29.087
You ruined me.

23:29.088 --> 23:30.297
You ruined my company,

23:30.298 --> 23:31.715
and I'm going to ruin you.

23:31.716 --> 23:33.008
If I don't get the truth,

23:33.009 --> 23:34.801
I will cut you, Janitor.

23:34.802 --> 23:36.261
- Jesus Christ.
- Start talking!

23:36.262 --> 23:38.639
Stu, what... what the hell
happened to you?

23:38.640 --> 23:40.182
You happened to me!

23:40.183 --> 23:44.436
And now Stu is gonna happen to you!

23:44.437 --> 23:46.157
All right, we don't have time
for this shit.

23:49.484 --> 23:50.692
Sweet ride.

23:50.693 --> 23:52.319
- I'm driving.
- No, I'm driving.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.571
What, so we can see
cousin Sophie in Wichita?

23:54.572 --> 23:56.365
Well, what do you wanna do,
go get the hamburgers

23:56.366 --> 23:58.158
from the Burger King?

23:58.159 --> 23:59.826
Hey, assholes.

23:59.827 --> 24:01.453
Get in, I'm driving!

24:07.251 --> 24:08.335
What the hell?

24:08.336 --> 24:09.378
What's happening?

24:09.379 --> 24:10.587
Whatever it is, it's her fault.

24:10.588 --> 24:12.589
Okay.

24:17.220 --> 24:18.595
Shit, shit.

24:18.596 --> 24:19.930
Run, run!

24:19.931 --> 24:21.974
That's right, you better run.

24:28.314 --> 24:30.899
Request that all civilians,

24:30.900 --> 24:32.985
I repeat, all civilians evacuate

24:32.986 --> 24:35.112
the park immediately.

24:45.373 --> 24:47.416
That's my caller!

24:48.459 --> 24:49.960
We're running into a fire.

24:49.961 --> 24:51.128
We're not.

24:51.129 --> 24:52.504
We're running away from Biotics.

24:52.505 --> 24:53.964
Yeah, into a fire.

24:59.429 --> 25:01.138
- Shit.
- God.

25:02.390 --> 25:04.474
What the fuck is that?

25:04.475 --> 25:05.642
It's microwire.

25:13.234 --> 25:14.985
Moruga scorpion.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.369
Holy shit.

25:24.829 --> 25:26.329
Looks like you saved the dish.

25:26.330 --> 25:27.831
And the mission.

25:31.002 --> 25:32.377
I got a knife!

25:35.715 --> 25:36.840
Whoa.

25:36.841 --> 25:39.301
That's not a knife.

25:39.302 --> 25:40.510
That's a knife.

25:40.511 --> 25:42.345
It's a sword.

25:43.514 --> 25:45.432
You're under arrest for the murder

25:45.433 --> 25:47.851
of Jorge...

25:47.852 --> 25:50.562
Shit.

25:50.563 --> 25:52.981
Fire's closing in, let's
get the fuck out of here.

26:03.201 --> 26:05.660
Where did they go?

26:10.625 --> 26:13.668
Where did they go?!

26:21.433 --> 26:22.469
Give...

26:22.470 --> 26:23.887
My dick back.

26:23.888 --> 26:27.182
Cock pirate.

26:30.645 --> 26:32.688
Fuck, that doesn't get any easier.

26:37.985 --> 26:39.402
God dammit.

26:39.403 --> 26:41.071
That feels weird,
my foot feels weird.

26:41.072 --> 26:42.406
Why does my foot feel weird?

26:50.873 --> 26:54.543
Why do I keep getting screwed?

26:54.544 --> 26:56.253
Let's go, let's finish this.

26:56.254 --> 26:57.504
Kill baby Kronish.

27:07.265 --> 27:08.557
'40s were weird.

27:10.893 --> 27:13.103
Wait a second.

27:13.104 --> 27:16.314
All right, guys,
we have to decide something.

27:16.315 --> 27:19.359
What kind of heroes are we gonna be?

27:19.360 --> 27:22.153
The kind who save
the world by killing a baby?

27:22.154 --> 27:23.697
Or the kind that save
the world by sending

27:23.698 --> 27:25.740
a man down a path towards a better life?

27:33.457 --> 27:34.875
Guys!

27:36.544 --> 27:39.170
What have you done, Futterman?

27:39.171 --> 27:41.256
There's a boat leaving tonight,

27:41.257 --> 27:43.843
and we're gonna make sure
Elias Kronish is on it.
