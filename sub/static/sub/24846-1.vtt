[bushes rustling]

02:00.208 --> 02:01.169
[breathing heavily]

02:19.056 --> 02:21.297
Hey!
Hey!

02:22.256 --> 02:23.217
Hey!

02:28.304 --> 02:29.264
What happened?

02:33.937 --> 02:35.857
- What happened?
- I do not know.

02:40.208 --> 02:41.361
Look.

02:44.721 --> 02:45.681
[guitar strumming]

03:23.921 --> 03:24.882
[man] Hey!

03:33.009 --> 03:34.161
[struggling]

04:20.430 --> 04:21.392
[panicking]

04:24.816 --> 04:29.070
- [woman] It's closed.
- [man] Help us please let us in!

04:29.072 --> 04:30.033
[knock on door]

04:30.287 --> 04:31.248
[door opens]

04:40.047 --> 04:41.009
[door closes]

05:14.320 --> 05:15.377
[Marcy] I need water.

05:35.184 --> 05:36.720
That stocking has my name on it.

05:39.728 --> 05:40.880
[Lisa] Mine too.

05:43.985 --> 05:45.009
That's my underwear.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.481
What is this?

06:00.305 --> 06:01.264
It's better than nothing.

06:12.911 --> 06:15.792
[Gabriella] Does anyone know
where we are?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.954
[Patrick] No idea, trying
to figure that out.

06:30.065 --> 06:32.082
Does anyone remember
what happened?

06:34.416 --> 06:37.295
- Anyone?
- No, it's all

06:37.297 --> 06:38.865
really, blurry.

06:54.576 --> 06:55.920
My head his killing me.

07:00.208 --> 07:03.154
It's the side effect
of over indulgence.

07:07.536 --> 07:08.529
You two know each other?

07:10.928 --> 07:12.592
No, I do not know anyone here.

07:14.287 --> 07:17.905
- [Patrick] You?
- No, me neither.

07:19.281 --> 07:20.240
No, sir.

07:22.831 --> 07:25.744
Do you think someone lives here?

07:26.992 --> 07:28.722
Well someone lit the fire, so.

07:32.336 --> 07:34.482
Hold on, let me check.

07:38.736 --> 07:39.889
Hello?

07:40.463 --> 07:41.904
Hello, is anybody in here?

07:43.439 --> 07:44.400
Hello?

07:46.065 --> 07:47.088
It's freezing.

07:49.871 --> 07:52.686
There's a sink in the next room,
but it doesn't pour out

07:52.688 --> 07:53.649
any water.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.559
I'm thinking everything's
shut off, I don't think anybody

07:56.561 --> 07:57.521
lives here.

07:58.255 --> 07:59.217
No water?

08:03.405 --> 08:07.216
- I can go get snow.
- No, don't go back out there.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.240
Red light.

08:15.887 --> 08:20.336
I'm remembering... a red light.

08:21.904 --> 08:22.864
Yeah.

08:24.528 --> 08:26.353
Yeah, a red light.

08:42.607 --> 08:43.568
[people chattering]

08:51.599 --> 08:52.560
[woman moaning]

08:59.920 --> 09:03.441
I distinctly remember being at
a, rather,

09:04.111 --> 09:06.928
exclusive party last night.

09:08.464 --> 09:09.424
Yeah.

09:10.672 --> 09:11.632
A sex party.

09:13.552 --> 09:14.513
Masquerade?

09:15.375 --> 09:19.441
OK, we are getting warmer,
so to speak.

09:20.497 --> 09:22.797
I assume all of you had
something to drink.

09:22.799 --> 09:25.808
We all attended the same party,
am I correct?

09:26.896 --> 09:29.934
Yes, I remember drinking

09:29.936 --> 09:32.560
- a reddish colored cocktail.
- Same.

09:33.551 --> 09:34.512
And you?

09:37.169 --> 09:40.525
Everything is blurry, but yeah,
I do faintly remember

09:40.527 --> 09:41.841
drinking something red.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.849
As do I, a Negroni.

09:47.312 --> 09:48.273
How about you?

09:50.865 --> 09:52.784
I don't really remember.

09:54.383 --> 09:56.720
I remember my drink
tasting funny.

09:58.255 --> 09:59.344
Specifically, bitter.

10:00.751 --> 10:05.328
Which leads me to suspect,
that my beverage was drugged.

10:08.528 --> 10:09.713
Oh my God!

10:11.856 --> 10:14.574
Oh my God, I think you're right.

10:14.576 --> 10:17.901
I've been roofied before,
in my early twenties.

10:17.903 --> 10:20.846
And I remember feeling
exactly like this,

10:20.848 --> 10:23.249
just, I didn't wake up naked
in the snow.

10:24.431 --> 10:27.248
What?
You think we were drugged?

10:28.144 --> 10:29.136
Most certainly.

10:30.512 --> 10:32.881
A negroni is a popular
gin based cocktail,

10:33.935 --> 10:35.344
appropriately enjoyed in summer.

10:36.111 --> 10:37.680
I think it originated in Italy.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.742
knowing this, I thought it
a deliberately incorrect choice

10:41.744 --> 10:43.025
to serve at a winter gathering.

10:43.855 --> 10:44.815
What's your point?

10:45.903 --> 10:47.504
My point is...

10:48.240 --> 10:51.534
I believe our host intentionally
served a summer drink,

10:51.536 --> 10:55.281
in juxtaposition to this
winter wonderland.

10:56.241 --> 10:59.185
as a savage mockery
of propriety.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.953
OK... so nobody has a clue
where we are?

11:07.536 --> 11:09.678
I was actually brought
to the party blindfolded,

11:09.680 --> 11:12.463
but it doesn't even matter,
because this is obviously

11:12.465 --> 11:13.520
not the same place.

11:14.287 --> 11:16.047
Jerome is known
for incorporating

11:16.049 --> 11:18.320
a preblinding element, at lots
of his parties.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.878
Jerome?
You mean the guy that hosted

11:20.880 --> 11:21.903
the party last night?

11:22.160 --> 11:23.120
Yes.

11:24.656 --> 11:26.158
So we know we have
two things in common:

11:26.160 --> 11:27.149
Fuck.

11:27.151 --> 11:28.976
We were all brought
to the party blindfolded,

11:30.097 --> 11:32.273
and we were all served
Negroni cocktails.

11:33.391 --> 11:36.497
Seemingly planted,
with Rohypnols.

11:37.104 --> 11:38.064
Yeah.

11:38.384 --> 11:39.920
Well I don't have time for this.

11:59.248 --> 12:00.208
[mysterious music]

12:48.784 --> 12:50.065
I want to see what's upstairs.

13:00.367 --> 13:01.904
We'll see what we can
find down here.

14:06.448 --> 14:07.408
[match sparks]

14:48.176 --> 14:51.569
- What is this place?
- That's disgusting.

15:32.495 --> 15:33.456
[screams]

16:28.624 --> 16:30.289
No parties like this
in Latvia, huh?

16:30.831 --> 16:31.791
No.

16:32.751 --> 16:33.711
[woman moaning]

16:36.304 --> 16:38.897
Honestly, it's not
as crazy as it seems.

16:40.431 --> 16:43.503
You know, an open-minded party
where you can meet very,

16:44.496 --> 16:48.208
I mean very, successful people,
trust me.

16:49.135 --> 16:51.535
I do, and I need
meet new people.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.509
Maybe someone who can help me
with my modeling career?

16:54.511 --> 16:55.598
Oh yeah.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.422
You would not believe
connections I've made so far,

16:57.424 --> 16:58.641
I'll introduce you, around.

16:58.992 --> 17:01.489
Oh thank you,
I really need that.

17:23.152 --> 17:24.784
[Jerome] Hello ladies.

17:26.031 --> 17:29.039
Katrina, this is the host
of this extravagant event.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.736
Jerome, meet Katrina.

17:31.887 --> 17:34.865
Thoroughly charmed.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.529
What enchanted forest
do you hail come?

17:42.382 --> 17:45.008
- I'm sorry?
- Where are you from, my dear?

17:46.032 --> 17:47.279
Oh, I am from Latvia.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.672
Ahh, let me guess, a model.

17:53.871 --> 17:57.423
Not only are you beautiful,
you are unique.

18:01.327 --> 18:03.504
I have some friends I'd like
to introduce you to, later on.

18:04.367 --> 18:07.343
- I would be honored.
- See?

18:08.144 --> 18:11.057
I'm sorry for my bad
English, but...

18:12.016 --> 18:16.657
All of this, your house, your
guests, is very beautiful.

18:18.031 --> 18:18.992
As are you.

18:20.176 --> 18:23.438
I see you are empty handed.
Why don't you go with Lisa here,

18:23.440 --> 18:24.559
and get yourself a cocktail.

18:25.648 --> 18:27.984
I'll introduce you to my
friends, once you've warmed up.

18:29.551 --> 18:30.512
Let's go.

18:31.824 --> 18:32.881
Enjoy, ladies.

18:47.247 --> 18:48.207
[woman crying]

18:53.422 --> 18:54.512
Oh my God!

19:02.256 --> 19:03.696
Jesus Christ!

19:07.344 --> 19:08.497
It's Katrina.

19:11.599 --> 19:12.559
You know her?

19:16.688 --> 19:19.729
I brought her to the party
last night.

19:22.095 --> 19:23.056
[door opens and shuts]

19:24.047 --> 19:25.040
What was that?

19:51.823 --> 19:52.656
My dears,

19:53.711 --> 19:55.694
one of you
is unfortunately responsible,

19:55.696 --> 19:57.713
for the death of the young girl
in the upstairs room.

19:58.927 --> 20:02.573
Starting now, you have until
five pm, to figure out

20:02.575 --> 20:03.663
which one of you, it is.

20:06.542 --> 20:09.805
The unfortunate one, amongst
you, shall receive a death

20:09.807 --> 20:13.263
of the same sentence, inflicted
by the others in the party.

20:15.118 --> 20:17.903
If no one in your little party
is found guilty,

20:18.480 --> 20:20.305
within the hours allotment,

20:20.975 --> 20:24.559
deadly consequences,
will be, released.

20:26.639 --> 20:27.600
Are you serious?

20:30.095 --> 20:31.217
- [door opens]
- Hey!

20:31.824 --> 20:32.785
[tense music]

20:50.416 --> 20:52.496
Come out you, coward!
Man up!

20:53.872 --> 20:56.368
[Patrick] Goddammit.
Where are you?

21:01.775 --> 21:03.214
No footprints, nothing.

21:03.216 --> 21:05.072
We found a garage door,
but couldn't open it.

21:05.487 --> 21:06.447
We will.

21:21.775 --> 21:22.736
[door opens]

21:39.472 --> 21:40.432
Oh my God!

21:46.831 --> 21:51.056
Is it me or, does it feel like
we're being watched?

21:52.624 --> 21:54.320
Oh we're definitely
being watched.

21:55.855 --> 21:57.168
That's what I'm afraid of.

21:58.639 --> 22:03.117
Jerome, usually you'd warn me
before putting me in your

22:03.119 --> 22:04.080
dirty movies.

22:11.343 --> 22:13.776
I need to find some blankets
before I get sick.

22:21.872 --> 22:26.255
Hey, hey, you see this?
You see this?

22:29.486 --> 22:32.941
No, no motherfucker,

22:32.943 --> 22:36.048
If I find you, I'm taking you,
and I'm smashing your head in!

22:49.134 --> 22:50.095
OK...

22:50.991 --> 22:55.340
Listen, whether this is a joke,
or a game,

22:55.342 --> 22:56.336
or whatever.

22:57.359 --> 23:01.648
We got to get out.
I think that's the garage door.

23:19.246 --> 23:21.199
What, is it locked?
Here, watch out.

23:22.959 --> 23:23.920
[struggling]

23:28.750 --> 23:32.272
Step aside.
Let Daddy take care of this.

23:32.559 --> 23:33.520
[struggles]

23:39.118 --> 23:40.079
[crashes]

23:46.382 --> 23:47.343
[door opens]

24:26.255 --> 24:28.303
Modern day
narcissism, Gabriella.

24:29.295 --> 24:32.240
Did you think being a digital
voyeur could be so deadly?

24:38.990 --> 24:39.951
[dark music]

24:50.766 --> 24:52.079
Hey guys,

24:53.103 --> 24:55.182
So I'm in one of the most
exclusive sex parties,

24:55.184 --> 24:56.240
in the US, baby.

24:56.782 --> 24:57.743
[giggles]

24:58.671 --> 25:00.878
I know some of my followers
wants to know

25:00.880 --> 25:02.540
what's going down inside.

25:02.542 --> 25:06.320
So, I'll keep you posted
throughout the night, OK?

25:07.695 --> 25:08.656
[music intensifies]

25:12.464 --> 25:13.424
[moaning]

25:37.583 --> 25:39.375
You can't take your phone
down there.

25:40.079 --> 25:41.040
Why not?

25:41.359 --> 25:42.479
I can store it for you.

25:44.848 --> 25:45.808
OK.

25:51.535 --> 25:52.496
[music intensifies]

25:57.232 --> 25:58.192
[woman gagging]

26:41.488 --> 26:42.607
[Marcy] Did you find anything?

26:43.374 --> 26:44.655
No, nothing.

26:46.287 --> 26:47.343
Can you help me with this?

26:49.776 --> 26:50.928
OK.

27:05.743 --> 27:07.983
[Marcy] It's stuck, come help
me open this.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.680
What's in there?

27:22.990 --> 27:24.174
Well that's interesting.

27:28.622 --> 27:30.735
It's plugged in, but it won't
turn on.

28:02.031 --> 28:02.991
[dark music]

28:52.656 --> 28:53.808
[man screams]

28:55.983 --> 28:56.943
[wailing in pain]

29:02.286 --> 29:05.039
- What happened?
- My hand, it burns.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.231
It looks like acid.
Go get some snow, quick!

29:10.895 --> 29:12.720
What happened?
Is he OK?

29:21.231 --> 29:22.384
Here, just put it on top.

29:26.159 --> 29:27.119
[grunting]

29:32.527 --> 29:33.712
[Duco] Oh, shit.

29:34.350 --> 29:37.455
Wouldn't it be a great way,
to asphyxiate, Duco?

29:37.711 --> 29:38.672
What?

29:39.631 --> 29:42.800
You don't understand,
he will kill all of us.

29:43.311 --> 29:44.237
Who do you mean, who?

29:44.239 --> 29:47.215
Jerome, you don't know what
he's capable of.

29:52.783 --> 29:56.527
I worked for him as
a doorman, in Berlin.

29:57.294 --> 29:59.727
Yeah but how do you know that
Jerome is behind all of this?

30:01.230 --> 30:03.920
Trust me, I know it's him.

30:04.655 --> 30:08.335
He'd want nothing more than
to permanently separate us.

30:09.006 --> 30:10.671
- What else do you know?
- [man] Nothing.

30:12.079 --> 30:13.616
I know he's a sociopath.

30:14.094 --> 30:17.359
[Duco] He's unpredictable,
you know?

30:17.807 --> 30:19.437
[Patrick] And you still go
to his fuck parties?

30:19.439 --> 30:21.421
OK, you know what, we all went
to the same party,

30:21.423 --> 30:24.528
OK, so we got to figure
this out together.

30:25.423 --> 30:26.383
OK.

30:28.526 --> 30:30.541
But, who's to say that we
have to follow his rules?

30:30.543 --> 30:33.776
Yeah, why don't we just
wait out, and see what happens.

30:34.254 --> 30:36.589
No, you don't want
to do that, alright?

30:36.591 --> 30:38.862
I mean, isn't the dead girl
upstairs, proof enough?

30:39.758 --> 30:42.063
If what you're saying is true,
then we're running out of time.

30:42.639 --> 30:44.208
I didn't know there's
a dead girl upstairs?

30:44.526 --> 30:46.669
Katrina, her name is Katrina.

30:46.671 --> 30:49.679
Alright, listen, I tied her up,
and I,

30:51.023 --> 30:53.358
But it was consensual,
she consented.

30:54.095 --> 30:55.278
[Patrick] Consented my ass.

30:56.463 --> 31:00.560
I'm into bondage, alright?
Jerome offers

31:01.326 --> 31:05.583
a consensual way for me to have,
my fetish.

31:05.902 --> 31:08.556
Yes, well we were all the ones
who woke up naked in the snow,

31:08.558 --> 31:10.415
this morning, I didn't consent
to that!

31:11.727 --> 31:13.711
- Calm down, just.
- Don't touch me, you know?

31:14.095 --> 31:16.367
[Lisa] We're all trying
to figure this out.

31:16.943 --> 31:19.056
[Duco] She was fine,
and she consented.

31:20.174 --> 31:22.095
Don't look at me like Judas.

31:23.982 --> 31:26.862
I may have a fetish,
but I'm not a murderer.

31:29.871 --> 31:31.884
Brutal honesty from here
on out, OK?

31:31.886 --> 31:32.847
Now...

31:33.775 --> 31:36.621
Did anyone else see the girl
at the party?

31:36.623 --> 31:38.543
I mean, we were all there last
night, there's no denying it.

31:39.279 --> 31:40.944
- Another message.
- [Lisa] What does it say?

31:43.534 --> 31:46.287
Would like to try it
on again, Patrick?

31:51.630 --> 31:55.788
Well, well, well, turns out some
of us have more secrets,

31:55.790 --> 31:57.551
than we anticipated.

31:58.862 --> 32:02.636
Look familiar, huh, Patrick?

32:02.638 --> 32:05.293
- Don't touch me.
- Oh, and yet you have

32:05.295 --> 32:06.768
no problems touching
others, right?

32:07.247 --> 32:08.303
I'm warning you, step away.

32:10.222 --> 32:11.341
[struggling]

32:11.343 --> 32:13.103
Stop it, stop it!

32:21.582 --> 32:22.767
[Gabriella] Stop it, let him go!

32:30.607 --> 32:34.287
Alright, I'll tell you
what happened.

32:42.383 --> 32:45.742
[Jerome] Being your first time
here, what do you think?

32:50.191 --> 32:53.196
It's definitely an eyeful.
I wish my wife would

32:53.198 --> 32:53.966
dress like that.

32:55.502 --> 32:57.135
You should have brought
her with you.

32:58.094 --> 33:00.590
No, man, she's not
that open minded.

33:03.471 --> 33:06.287
I do have someone who
is open minded.

33:07.502 --> 33:08.590
Yeah?

33:08.592 --> 33:11.501
A friend of mine, she noticed
you in the beginning.

33:11.503 --> 33:12.463
of the evening.

33:13.807 --> 33:19.504
She actually requested some
special time, with you.

33:21.135 --> 33:22.192
[Jerome] That's if,
you're willing.

33:24.142 --> 33:25.103
I'm all ears.

33:26.639 --> 33:29.487
Good, follow me.

33:38.351 --> 33:39.312
[dark music]

34:13.167 --> 34:14.128
[paddling]

34:14.927 --> 34:15.887
[gasping]

34:37.998 --> 34:38.958
[moaning]

34:45.583 --> 34:46.543
[whining]

35:12.142 --> 35:14.635
I fucked her, OK?
And I used that

35:14.637 --> 35:15.887
at the same time.

35:17.455 --> 35:18.415
But that wouldn't kill her.

35:20.143 --> 35:21.648
And I was told she agreed to it.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.942
What are you all saints?
We all attended the same party!

35:25.743 --> 35:28.717
I mean you brought her there,
and you tied her up,

35:28.719 --> 35:30.319
and strangled her,
for Christ's sake!

35:30.798 --> 35:33.484
- We saw the marks on her neck!
- Calm down just,

35:33.486 --> 35:34.511
please calm down.

35:37.774 --> 35:39.983
What the fuck is this?
What is that?

35:43.918 --> 35:44.879
Enlightening.

35:45.262 --> 35:47.887
Modern narcissism, Gabriella.

35:49.197 --> 35:52.655
Did you think being a digital
voyeur, could be so deadly?

35:55.311 --> 35:58.672
The Lord has shun down upon us.
We've got a phone.

35:59.342 --> 36:01.455
There is no connection,
or anything useful in it.

36:01.646 --> 36:03.375
Just believe me,
I already checked.

36:04.013 --> 36:06.351
Really, then why were you
hiding it, little darling?

36:07.949 --> 36:09.068
Did you use that phone
at the party?

36:09.070 --> 36:10.030
What did you do with that?

36:11.822 --> 36:15.534
- I recorded.
- You recorded, what?

36:16.110 --> 36:18.350
- Some stuff at the party.
- What stuff?

36:18.542 --> 36:19.918
- Did you record Katrina?
- Did you?

36:20.941 --> 36:23.245
I recorded what you guys
did to her, but that's it.

36:23.247 --> 36:25.484
Why would you do that?
Are you sick?

36:25.486 --> 36:26.447
Where is the video?

36:27.439 --> 36:30.123
How should I know?
I woke up naked in the snow,

36:30.125 --> 36:30.893
just like you.

36:31.949 --> 36:33.996
Did you kill that girl?
Did you do it?

36:33.998 --> 36:34.959
[coughing]

36:37.839 --> 36:39.663
I did not touch her, I swear.

36:40.046 --> 36:41.519
What was the last thing you saw?

36:41.839 --> 36:43.374
Patrick fucked her.

36:47.214 --> 36:50.927
He left right afterward,
and I left as well.

36:52.014 --> 36:54.063
And I think she was still
breathing, I swear.

36:59.758 --> 37:00.907
Guys, where's Marcy?

37:00.909 --> 37:02.031
[coughing]

37:20.782 --> 37:22.766
It's the quiet ones you have
to worry about.

37:23.759 --> 37:25.932
Sneaky little cunt probably knew
everything right

37:25.934 --> 37:27.084
- from the beginning.
- OK, stop.

37:27.086 --> 37:29.934
You know what?
Everybody needs to stop.

37:30.669 --> 37:33.709
We cannot go on like that,
or we'll all end up

37:33.711 --> 37:34.671
hurting each other.

37:35.758 --> 37:37.676
We cannot keep blaming
one another, that's just what

37:37.678 --> 37:38.639
he wants.

37:40.142 --> 37:42.604
You know, what, I do not know
about you, but I'm not

37:42.606 --> 37:44.334
playing by these sick rules.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.259
I'm going to go outside,
to see if I can find someone,

37:49.261 --> 37:50.543
or something.

37:53.487 --> 37:54.543
You won't last out there.

37:55.694 --> 37:57.964
Yeah, I might not, but it sure
as hell doesn't look like

37:57.966 --> 37:59.599
any of us, will last, in here.

38:10.159 --> 38:11.279
You're really doing this?

38:22.414 --> 38:25.008
Here, and this.

38:41.422 --> 38:42.383
[ominous noises]

39:09.967 --> 39:11.119
[dark music]

39:36.333 --> 39:39.662
Do you know, mixing drinks,
is an art?

39:41.615 --> 39:43.183
Does that make you
an artist, Marcy?

39:43.918 --> 39:45.838
I don't know, I guess so.

39:47.341 --> 39:51.055
- How are your kids?
- [Marcy] Great, thanks.

39:54.126 --> 39:56.463
Do you have a picture of them,
you can show me?

39:59.535 --> 40:02.444
Listen, I need to take some
time off, I can't

40:02.446 --> 40:03.439
work next week

40:04.398 --> 40:06.190
I got away with the kids,
for the holidays.

40:10.255 --> 40:13.871
Must be nice that you can
afford things, for your kids.

40:25.358 --> 40:26.542
Don't push it, Marcy.

40:45.358 --> 40:46.319
[suspense building]

41:49.678 --> 41:50.639
[gasping]

41:58.478 --> 41:59.438
[crow cawing]

42:25.262 --> 42:26.351
[Gabriella] She's not going
to survive.

42:27.310 --> 42:28.463
I don't know what
she was thinking?

42:29.549 --> 42:31.789
[Patrick] I don't know, what if
she finds another cabin,

42:31.791 --> 42:33.327
in a few miles, and brings
us back some help?

42:34.350 --> 42:35.822
If she makes it that far.

42:36.813 --> 42:38.542
Yeah, well, we better hope
she does.

42:45.005 --> 42:46.191
We need to find Marcy.

42:47.182 --> 42:49.711
Yes, go ahead, I'll see you
upstairs in a bit.

42:51.117 --> 42:54.414
And, I need this, rope.

42:56.877 --> 43:01.134
- Shouldn't we stick together?
- Yes, I'll be there in a minute.

43:03.981 --> 43:07.374
Alright, we'll be upstairs,
be quick.

43:30.542 --> 43:31.502
Marcy?

43:48.334 --> 43:51.534
[Gabriella] Hey guys, check out
the video that I just uploaded.

44:19.950 --> 44:20.911
[dark music]

45:36.173 --> 45:37.358
[Jerome] A lovely sight,
isn't it?

45:43.885 --> 45:45.039
[Gabriella] Yes, indeed.

45:49.805 --> 45:53.358
[Jerome] I do hope you're
enjoying, my party.

45:55.311 --> 45:56.271
I'm Jerome.

45:58.733 --> 45:59.694
Gabriella

46:04.013 --> 46:06.862
Who knows what the next
moment may hold?

46:08.206 --> 46:09.422
[Gabriella] So true,

46:11.886 --> 46:13.487
but I'll enjoy it while
it lasts.

46:16.653 --> 46:20.365
[Jerome] Isn't it interesting,
how we are all faced

46:20.941 --> 46:22.222
with a choice,

46:26.382 --> 46:28.494
in each, and every
waking moment.

46:35.950 --> 46:37.071
Make the right one.

47:03.565 --> 47:04.526
[sniffling]

47:56.558 --> 47:57.519
[groaning]

48:26.413 --> 48:27.374
[ominous music]

48:29.517 --> 48:30.477
[breathing heavy]

49:55.821 --> 49:56.782
[counting in German]

50:02.766 --> 50:03.919
[moaning]

50:30.189 --> 50:31.150
[coughing]

50:42.508 --> 50:43.469
[rope snaps]

50:46.445 --> 50:47.790
Oh, shit.

51:12.685 --> 51:14.445
What's taking him so long?

51:16.621 --> 51:17.582
[door opens and closes]

51:24.749 --> 51:25.710
What happened to you?

51:27.789 --> 51:31.531
I had a difficult time getting
this rope off that

51:31.533 --> 51:32.558
wretched swing.

51:34.830 --> 51:36.110
It looks like you got it though.

51:38.381 --> 51:41.357
Yeah, indeed.

52:02.637 --> 52:03.597
[Duco] Marcy...

52:05.870 --> 52:07.438
Marcy.

52:16.781 --> 52:18.445
Are you okay, sweetie?

52:19.597 --> 52:20.942
Marcy...

52:39.758 --> 52:40.719
[panicking]

52:40.974 --> 52:42.635
- No!
- What the fuck are you doing?

52:42.637 --> 52:43.598
[struggling]

52:43.853 --> 52:45.293
- Stay here!
- [Marcy] No!

52:45.934 --> 52:48.139
Please don't hurt me,
I have children.

52:48.141 --> 52:50.381
You have kids?
What did you do?

52:54.861 --> 52:57.005
- Where did you find it?
- It was in here.

52:57.260 --> 52:58.731
[Duco] Was there a message
on that bottle?

52:58.733 --> 53:00.846
No, no, no.

53:09.773 --> 53:13.390
Sweet, and swift, with a touch
of bitterness.

53:14.189 --> 53:16.398
Is that how you
poured it, Marcy?

53:18.413 --> 53:20.235
You drugged everyone,
didn't you?

53:20.237 --> 53:21.806
No!

53:22.701 --> 53:25.710
I was afraid everyone would
think that, if you found me.

53:26.094 --> 53:27.759
Yeah, then what is that?

53:29.005 --> 53:31.852
I think it's
crushed up Rohypnols.

53:31.854 --> 53:32.844
[Patrick] You fucking
drugged us?

53:32.846 --> 53:35.693
No, I work for Jerome,

53:37.198 --> 53:39.214
I only roofy drinks
for certain guests.

53:39.533 --> 53:42.189
If I roofied you, I wouldn't
be here, don't you think?

53:43.309 --> 53:44.301
Did you roofy her?

53:45.421 --> 53:49.487
[Marcy] Yes, but that's not
what killed her, I swear.

53:50.061 --> 53:52.523
I don't understand.
If you're saying the truth,

53:52.525 --> 53:53.775
Then how did we get drugged?

53:53.965 --> 53:54.926
[Marcy] OK.

53:57.581 --> 54:01.643
Later in the night,
Jerome he gave me

54:01.645 --> 54:04.141
this expensive bottle of gin
when we were running low.

54:07.501 --> 54:09.998
I was told to save it until
the very end of the night,

54:10.413 --> 54:12.975
to only give it to the last four
people who ordered drinks.

54:13.742 --> 54:14.926
You were the last four.

54:18.126 --> 54:21.359
And I knew it was a rare gin,
so I had some too.

54:23.661 --> 54:28.847
I think the bottle was drugged.
I swear I didn't know.

54:29.358 --> 54:31.501
[Duco] Did you see the last
person to leave the party?

54:36.686 --> 54:37.774
It was Lisa.

54:44.428 --> 54:45.389
[suspenseful music]

55:46.989 --> 55:50.766
- Darling, where are you going?
- Hey, uhm.

55:51.213 --> 55:53.326
Do you know where Katrina is?

55:53.548 --> 55:56.846
Lying, she's fine.
You shouldn't worry about her.

55:57.517 --> 56:00.685
- I need to take her home.
- Actually...

56:04.077 --> 56:05.358
She'll be staying
the night here.

56:08.109 --> 56:09.838
Thank you for bringing
her to me.

56:16.974 --> 56:20.652
What did she get paid for?
I don't understand.

56:20.654 --> 56:22.574
She was paid to bring her
to the party.

56:23.246 --> 56:25.485
[Gabriella] You mean she knew
what would happen to her friend?

56:28.237 --> 56:31.149
- And we have a winner.
- What are you talking about?

56:32.077 --> 56:34.029
It looks like Lisa,
is the guilty party.

56:34.862 --> 56:36.107
[Patrick] You know, I'm sick
of you making light

56:36.109 --> 56:37.966
out of all this.
I really am.

56:38.253 --> 56:39.725
Do you enjoy this or what?

56:40.526 --> 56:42.991
Simmer down, sir.
Simmer down.

56:43.469 --> 56:46.127
What we have before us,
is a very happy moment.

56:46.349 --> 56:49.550
An end to this heinous game,
a way out.

56:51.373 --> 56:54.413
- You mean Lisa?
- Lisa.

57:08.332 --> 57:09.293
[intensifying dark music]

57:11.789 --> 57:12.750
[Jerome] Lisa...

57:16.269 --> 57:17.230
[Jerome] Lisa...

58:04.237 --> 58:07.021
- [Katrina] this is all so...
- [Lisa] Overwhelming?

58:07.981 --> 58:09.869
Yeah, that's how I felt,
when I first came.

58:11.085 --> 58:14.219
- I just...
- What?

58:14.221 --> 58:15.182
Everything OK?

58:16.588 --> 58:19.981
I don't know, I feel very bad
for being here.

58:20.844 --> 58:21.805
Well why is that?

58:26.253 --> 58:28.652
My family, they are very poor.

58:28.654 --> 58:29.934
So, I send them money.

58:31.469 --> 58:34.986
My mother, she thinks it's
from modeling, but really,

58:34.988 --> 58:36.621
I take any job that I can get.

58:38.029 --> 58:39.950
It is very difficult for me.

58:42.350 --> 58:45.642
They are very religious.
This would be a big shame

58:45.644 --> 58:46.605
for them.

58:47.404 --> 58:48.749
Well, but, how would they know?

58:49.774 --> 58:51.469
It's impossible, really.

58:54.284 --> 58:55.405
I understand though.

58:56.429 --> 58:59.339
When I started working
for Jerome, I did not want

58:59.341 --> 59:01.006
them to know how I was
making money.

59:02.509 --> 59:04.525
You know what the girl
that got me this job, told me?

59:05.134 --> 59:06.286
What?

59:07.182 --> 59:09.742
What mom doesn't know,
doesn't hurt her.

59:13.709 --> 59:14.670
I understand.

59:20.397 --> 59:24.302
Actually, uhm, give me a minute.

59:47.884 --> 59:48.845
Excuse me.

59:51.533 --> 59:52.589
How can I help you, darling?

59:53.676 --> 59:57.867
You know I think my new friend,
Katrina, would be good

59:57.869 --> 01:00:00.334
at helping me bring new faces,
to your parties.

01:00:05.581 --> 01:00:08.906
You think your only job,
is to bring me girls

01:00:08.908 --> 01:00:09.869
to have fun?

01:00:22.317 --> 01:00:23.310
[Lisa] What do you want?

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.461
I didn't know.

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:39.950
I didn't know she would die.

01:00:50.093 --> 01:00:53.134
Or, did she?

01:01:24.652 --> 01:01:26.541
[Duco] We need to arrive
at a consensus.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:29.835
Since we all agree that Lisa,
was ultimately responsible

01:01:29.837 --> 01:01:31.342
for the girl's death,

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.861
The unfortunate one
amongst us, Lisa.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.125
Shall receive a death
of the same sentence,

01:01:38.764 --> 01:01:41.069
inflicted by the others,
in the party.

01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:43.981
Now, listen closely.

01:01:45.837 --> 01:01:48.141
Since we all know that we
did harm, to the girl,

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:52.077
Katrina, but are unclear as
to how she actually died.

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:56.012
I suggest that we cover
our asses, by inflicting

01:01:56.014 --> 01:01:57.742
the same harm, onto Lisa.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.293
But only if we are all agree
to take part.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.878
Wait, what do you mean exactly?

01:02:05.452 --> 01:02:08.426
In layman's terms,
Marcy you will give her

01:02:08.428 --> 01:02:11.853
a special gin cocktail,
to warm her up.

01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:17.006
I will tie her up,
and, I will strangle her.

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:22.574
You, sir, will flog her,
and rape her.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.678
And you will record
the whole thing, Gabriella.

01:02:26.317 --> 01:02:30.190
It is the only way to ensure,
that we cover our tracks,

01:02:30.381 --> 01:02:31.501
and follow the rules.

01:02:35.277 --> 01:02:38.830
OK, if it's the only way, then.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.941
Marcy!

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.101
And you?

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:54.316
It's just so goddamn rotten.
I mean what if we just wait?

01:02:55.468 --> 01:02:56.909
Fuck me.

01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:59.949
Unfortunately, that is not
an option.

01:03:00.236 --> 01:03:03.660
I for one, am unwilling to meet
the ramifications

01:03:03.853 --> 01:03:06.062
of our inability, to meet
Jerome's guidelines.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.173
I can assure you,
the consequences released,

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:13.581
will be deadly.

01:03:16.301 --> 01:03:18.410
Honestly, I hope she freezes
to death out there,

01:03:18.412 --> 01:03:21.101
for her own sake, rather than
come back to this.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.486
[eerie noises]

01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:31.789
[thud]

01:03:32.492 --> 01:03:33.453
What was that?

01:03:36.268 --> 01:03:37.549
- [Duco] Careful.
- [Gabriella] Yeah.

01:03:39.597 --> 01:03:40.622
[Gabriella] Oh my God!

01:03:45.804 --> 01:03:46.765
Oh, honey.

01:03:51.148 --> 01:03:53.901
Come here, it's OK, it's OK.

01:03:58.732 --> 01:04:00.781
Come here, come here honey.

01:04:20.525 --> 01:04:21.773
There's nothing.

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:26.350
You found alcohol?

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:33.326
Yeah, upstairs.

01:04:50.221 --> 01:04:53.291
It's OK sweetie, we just need
to get you warmed up

01:04:53.293 --> 01:04:55.470
a little bit.
It's OK.

01:04:57.356 --> 01:04:58.893
It's all going to be fine.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.549
It's gonna be fine.

01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:21.646
I walked for miles.

01:05:24.044 --> 01:05:27.949
I found nothing, just snow.

01:05:29.485 --> 01:05:33.614
You've done so well.
You just worry about warming up.

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.965
We figured out everything
while you were away.

01:05:53.005 --> 01:05:54.574
We need to check her body.

01:05:56.493 --> 01:05:57.454
[Marcy] Whose body?

01:05:59.628 --> 01:06:00.590
Katrina.

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:09.326
Shall we?

01:06:13.773 --> 01:06:14.734
[building suspenseful music]

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:35.470
Look

01:08:13.676 --> 01:08:14.638
[struggles]

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.644
Don't fight me.
Don't fight.

01:08:28.587 --> 01:08:29.550
[Duco] Bring here in here.

01:08:33.002 --> 01:08:33.965
[gasping]

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.075
Just hurry.

01:08:48.077 --> 01:08:50.925
Are you recording this?
Record it, hurry!

01:08:51.468 --> 01:08:53.100
OK, give me your panties.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.180
[gagging]

01:09:03.596 --> 01:09:04.558
Don't do that.

01:09:06.603 --> 01:09:07.564
Shut up.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.140
Fuck her!
Fuck her!

01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:22.669
Fuck her!

01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:24.749
- [Patrick] I can't.
- [Duco] Why not?

01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:27.725
- I can't fucking get hard, man!
- Oh Jesus Christ.

01:09:29.388 --> 01:09:31.309
Take this thing, put it on.

01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:38.510
[Duco] Fuck her!

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:40.430
[crying]

01:09:58.764 --> 01:09:59.725
Fuck her.

01:10:25.356 --> 01:10:27.470
Stop it!
Stop!

01:10:28.044 --> 01:10:29.004
[crying]

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:39.981
[Marcy] Come here, quick!

01:11:07.819 --> 01:11:08.781
[video playing]

01:11:18.891 --> 01:11:19.853
What time is it?

01:11:21.228 --> 01:11:22.316
[Marcy] Almost five.

01:11:23.021 --> 01:11:26.061
[Katrina] No... what?
No...

01:11:28.204 --> 01:11:29.357
[crying]

01:11:45.196 --> 01:11:46.350
What did you do with the video?

01:11:51.148 --> 01:11:59.210
I streamed live from her phone.

01:11:59.212 --> 01:12:01.485
I'm no worse off than any
of you guys.

01:12:24.109 --> 01:12:25.389
You know what this means.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.566
We picked the wrong one.

01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:41.901
[liquid dripping]

01:12:47.819 --> 01:12:48.781
[coughing]

01:13:02.188 --> 01:13:03.149
[Gabriella] What is that smell?

01:13:05.995 --> 01:13:06.957
[Marcy] What is that smell?

01:13:09.291 --> 01:13:10.253
It's gas.

01:13:19.373 --> 01:13:20.333
[gasping]

01:13:31.405 --> 01:13:32.365
[dark music]

01:14:39.947 --> 01:14:41.804
Why suffer at the fault,
of others?

01:14:43.757 --> 01:14:44.845
Let the wicked suffer.

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:00.877
Rest, darling.

01:15:05.099 --> 01:15:06.669
Wake up in peace.

01:15:23.308 --> 01:15:24.269
[Katrina] Thank you.

01:15:41.547 --> 01:15:42.509
