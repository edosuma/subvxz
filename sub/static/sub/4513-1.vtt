What's your name again?

02:29.191 --> 02:30.399
Chrissie.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.318
Where are we going?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.486
Swimming.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.575
Slow up. Slow down.

02:40.077 --> 02:43.287
I'm not drunk! Slow down!

02:44.957 --> 02:46.666
Wait. I'm coming.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.460
I'm coming.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.505
I'm definitely coming.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.673
Whoa.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.299
Hold on. Whoa!

03:04.810 --> 03:06.269
I can swim.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.814
I just can't walk
or undress myself.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.878
Come on in the water!

03:31.962 --> 03:33.796
Take it easy.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.877
Oh, God, help!

04:20.510 --> 04:22.053
Please help me!

04:22.346 --> 04:24.180
I'm coming.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.767
It hurts!

05:05.639 --> 05:07.515
<i>...local fishing reported good.</i>

05:07.599 --> 05:09.684
<i>Amity Boat Rental Yard's
opening early</i>

05:09.768 --> 05:11.852
<i>to prepare for the
annual seasonal rush.</i>

05:11.937 --> 05:13.604
<i>This is WISS...</i>

05:17.818 --> 05:20.903
How come the sun
didn't use to shine in here?

05:23.782 --> 05:27.284
We bought the house in the fall,
and this is summer.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.666
Somebody feed the dogs.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.959
Right.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.340
Do you see the kids?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.432
They must be in the back yard.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.517
In Amity you say "yard."

05:53.020 --> 05:56.981
They're in the "yard,"
not too "far" from the "car."

05:59.818 --> 06:01.027
How's that?

06:01.111 --> 06:02.278
Like you're from New York.

06:04.156 --> 06:07.450
Mum, I got cut.
I got hit by a vampire.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.701
You were playing on those swings,
weren't you?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.037
Those swings are dangerous.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.705
Stay off there.
I haven't fixed them yet.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.499
I think you're going to live.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.210
- It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- Hello.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.087
- Yes.
- Can I go swimming?

06:20.172 --> 06:22.465
Yeah, but let me clean
this thing off first.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.718
What do they usually do?
Wash up, or float up, or what?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.180
Oh, no.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.184
Keep them there.
I'll be out in about

06:34.144 --> 06:36.562
15, 20 minutes. All right?

06:36.646 --> 06:38.147
- Dry you off.
- Okay.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.899
Go on, get a Band-Aid.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.568
Got to go. Missing person.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.863
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.910
Listen, Chief...

06:51.578 --> 06:52.703
be careful, will you?

06:52.788 --> 06:53.829
In this town?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.498
Hi, Dad.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.374
Wait a minute.
Let me get on.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.126
I want my cup back!

06:59.211 --> 07:00.419
You'll get it.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.923
Wave goodbye. Bye.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.413
Nobody saw her go into the water?

07:36.540 --> 07:39.959
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.169
You mean, she ran out on you?

07:42.254 --> 07:43.379
No, sir.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.550
She must've drowned.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.719
Look, I reported it to you,
didn't I?

07:50.804 --> 07:51.929
You live here?

07:52.013 --> 07:53.097
No. Hartford.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.016
I go to Trinity.
My folks live in Greenwich.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.351
Your folks were born here, right?

07:57.435 --> 07:58.894
Yeah, I'm an Islander.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.980
They moved off when my dad retired.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.064
You an Islander?

08:02.149 --> 08:03.232
No. New York City.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.860
You here for the summer?
Come on.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.749
Hold it.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.763
Oh, Jesus.

08:59.623 --> 09:03.584
Well, you're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.922
Chief, what have you got on?

09:08.006 --> 09:09.924
If this new filing system is to work,

09:10.008 --> 09:11.926
you must keep outdated stuff
off my desk.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.011
- Just the pending, all right?
- Yes, Chief.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.847
We got a bunch of calls
about that karate school.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.808
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been

09:19.893 --> 09:22.311
karate-ing the picket fences.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.024
Chief Brody's office.
The medical inspector.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.872
The Fire Chief wants you
to go over the Fourth of July...

09:41.998 --> 09:44.166
Polly, I want a list
of the water activities

09:44.251 --> 09:46.418
that the city fathers
are planning for today.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.878
- Right away.
- Hendricks!

09:48.004 --> 09:50.172
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.507
- We never had any.
- No?

09:51.591 --> 09:55.010
There's a dead truck with New Hampshire plates
in front of my store.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.682
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.832
Look what the kids did to my fence.
8 and 9-year-olds...

10:24.916 --> 10:26.625
- Glasses?
- Yeah, glasses.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.587
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.512
This stuff ain't going
to help me in August.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.973
The summer ginks
come down here in June.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.934
You haven't got one thing on
here I ordered.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.272
Not a beach umbrella,
not a sun lounger, no beach balls.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.274
If I can't get service...

10:57.324 --> 10:59.992
Chief, Polly sent me to tell you

11:00.076 --> 11:02.077
that there's a bunch of Boy Scouts
out in Avril Bay

11:02.162 --> 11:04.121
doing the mile swim
for their merit badges.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.665
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.459
Okay. Come on,
get out of there.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.085
Take this stuff
back to the office

11:10.211 --> 11:11.712
and get to work on those signs.

11:11.796 --> 11:15.174
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."

11:15.258 --> 11:16.800
Let Polly do the printing.

11:16.926 --> 11:17.968
What's the matter with my printing?

11:18.053 --> 11:20.387
Let Polly do the printing.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.889
Chief Brody!

11:25.435 --> 11:26.727
What have you got there?

11:26.811 --> 11:28.312
Listen, we had a shark attack

11:28.396 --> 11:30.022
at South Beach this morning, Mayor.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.732
Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.444
Albert, come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.828
Charlie, take me out to those kids,
will you?

12:08.311 --> 12:11.605
Martin, you're going to shut down the beaches
on your own authority?

12:11.689 --> 12:13.399
What other authority do I need?

12:13.483 --> 12:14.900
Technically, you need a civic ordinance

12:14.984 --> 12:16.485
or a resolution by a board of...

12:16.611 --> 12:17.986
That's just going by the book.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.405
We're really a little anxious

12:19.489 --> 12:22.241
that you're rushing
into something serious here.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.368
This is your first summer, you know.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.161
What does that mean?

12:26.621 --> 12:30.207
I'm only trying to say that Amity
is a summer town.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.835
We need summer dollars.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.461
If they can't swim here

12:34.546 --> 12:36.380
they'll be glad to swim
at the beaches

12:36.464 --> 12:38.715
of Cape Cod, the Hamptons,
Long Island.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.135
That doesn't mean we serve them
a smorgasbord.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.638
But we've never had that kind of trouble
in these waters.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.557
What else could've done that
to that girl?

12:46.641 --> 12:47.724
A boat propeller?

12:47.851 --> 12:51.061
I think possibly, yes,
a boating accident.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.729
That's not what you told me
on the phone.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.273
I was wrong.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.275
We'll have to amend our reports.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.359
And you'll stand by that?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.069
I'll stand by that.

12:59.404 --> 13:03.866
Martin, a summer girl goes swimming,
swims out a little far.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.493
She tires,
fishing boat comes along...

13:06.578 --> 13:07.703
It's happened before.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.247
I don't think you appreciate
the gut reaction

13:10.331 --> 13:11.498
people have to these things.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.543
Larry, I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.171
Martin, it's all psychological.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.550
You yell, "Barracuda!"
And everybody says, "Huh? What?"

13:23.511 --> 13:25.387
You yell, "Shark!"...

13:26.556 --> 13:29.683
we've got a panic on our hands
on the Fourth of July.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.896
Okay. You can take us back now.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.532
Here's mommy, here.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.328
I'm going to get my raft
and go back out in the water.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.413
Let me see your fingers.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.416
Alex Kintner,
they're beginning to prune.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.418
Just let me go out a little longer.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.669
Just 10 more minutes.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.879
Thanks.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.591
There are no Islanders.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.842
None of them are from the island.

14:03.927 --> 14:04.968
It's just a big bother.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.011
They're bringing in...

14:06.095 --> 14:07.346
All I want to know...

14:07.430 --> 14:09.473
I just want to know
one simple thing.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.099
When do I get to become an Islander?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.310
Ellen, never.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.854
You're not born here,
you're not an Islander. That's it.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.306
<i>Nantucket Ferries...</i>

14:51.474 --> 14:53.892
<i>to Amity, Martha's Vineyard
and Nantucket islands.</i>

14:53.977 --> 14:57.396
<i>Monday to Thursday,
8:40, 1:15, 5:45 and 6:00 p.m.</i>

14:57.480 --> 15:00.148
<i>Starting July 1, 8:30 p.m...</i>

15:03.945 --> 15:05.237
Come back here.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.790
- But don't bother him. Come right back.
- Okay. I won't.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.753
Martin, I know you got
a lot of problems downtown

15:21.838 --> 15:24.923
but I've got problems at the house
I wish you'd take care of.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.592
One, I've got some cats parking

15:26.676 --> 15:27.759
in front of the house,
I can't get...

15:29.012 --> 15:32.472
And that garbage truck next to the office,
that's terrible.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.184
What I need is a red zone.
It's a simple thing you can take care of.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.313
- You've done it before.
- Come here a minute, please.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.109
Are you okay?

15:44.193 --> 15:46.278
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.364
Listen, if the kids going in the water
is worrying you

15:49.490 --> 15:52.492
they can play out here on the beach.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.536
It's all right.
Let them go.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.339
It's cold.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.301
We know all about you, Chief.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.511
You don't go in the water
at all, do you?

16:12.180 --> 16:14.056
That's some bad hat, Harry.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.855
Chief Brody, you are uptight.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.234
Come on. That's it.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.329
<i>Oh, do you know the muffin man</i>

16:37.413 --> 16:38.664
<i>The muffin man</i>

16:39.540 --> 16:41.166
Tippet!

17:11.280 --> 17:13.031
Did you see that?

17:21.457 --> 17:22.708
Blood!

17:27.630 --> 17:29.047
Everybody out!

17:32.301 --> 17:33.802
Get them out!

17:40.143 --> 17:42.477
Michael, get out of the water!

17:55.408 --> 17:56.491
Alex?

18:15.511 --> 18:18.263
We don't even know
if there's a shark around here.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.016
I can't argue with you.
I can't talk to you.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.477
I have to talk to Mrs. Kintner.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.270
Because this is turning into a contest.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.149
It's not just the Gazette.
She's advertising in out-of-town papers.

18:29.609 --> 18:33.361
I suggest we move back to council chambers
where we'll have more room.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.447
I'm responsible for public safety here.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.533
Then go out tomorrow
and see that no one gets hurt.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.369
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.206
The ad will run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.209
Right in here, please.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.504
Move on in, please.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.645
Why do you insist
on playing the heavy?

19:06.729 --> 19:10.857
I have a point of view and I think
it speaks for many of the people here.

19:13.861 --> 19:17.489
Not only me, because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.366
Let's have some order.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.370
Let's have order, please.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.081
Any special questions?

19:27.083 --> 19:30.669
Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark
in cash or check?

19:32.380 --> 19:33.463
I don't think that's funny.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.757
I don't think that's funny at all.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.259
All right.

19:38.094 --> 19:41.680
That's private business
between you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.226
Martin, would you please...

19:46.936 --> 19:48.353
Chief Brody.

19:50.106 --> 19:53.525
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.360
What about the beaches, Chief?

19:55.444 --> 19:59.531
We're going to put on the extra
summer deputies as soon as possible.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.951
And then we're going to try
and use shark spotters on the beach.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.412
Are you going to close the beaches?

20:09.083 --> 20:10.292
Yes, we are.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.046
We also plan to bring in experts

20:15.131 --> 20:17.632
from the Oceanographic Institute
on the mainland.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.594
Only 24 hours.

20:20.678 --> 20:21.761
I didn't agree to that.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.390
Only 24 hours.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.768
Twenty-four hours
is like three weeks!

20:52.418 --> 20:55.962
You all know me.
Know how I earn a living.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.924
I'll catch this bird for you.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.343
It ain't going to be easy.
Bad fish.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.678
Not like going down to the pond

21:03.763 --> 21:06.181
and chasing bluegills or tommy cods.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.143
This shark, swallow you whole.

21:11.270 --> 21:15.690
Shaking, tenderizing.
Down you go.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.109
And we got to do it quick.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.527
Got to bring back the tourists

21:19.612 --> 21:22.697
that'll put all your businesses
on a paying basis.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.784
But it's not going to be pleasant.

21:25.868 --> 21:29.037
I value my neck
a lot more than $3,000, Chief.

21:29.872 --> 21:34.376
I'll find him for $3,000,
but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.003
You got to make up your minds.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.547
Gonna stay alive and ante up,

21:39.632 --> 21:43.218
gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare the whole winter.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.055
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

21:47.181 --> 21:50.058
There's too many captains
on this island.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.894
$10,000 for me, by myself.

21:53.729 --> 21:58.400
For that, you get the head, the tail,
the whole damn thing.

22:02.363 --> 22:04.739
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.910
We'll take it under advisement.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.457
Mr. Mayor, Chief,

22:16.627 --> 22:18.545
ladies and gentlemen.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.497
Oh, God, you scared me.

22:58.294 --> 23:02.047
You know, Ellen, people don't even know
how old sharks are.

23:02.131 --> 23:05.300
I mean, if they live 2,000, 3,000 years...
They don't know.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.594
Enough.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.471
You're not going to even be able
to go to sleep tonight.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.806
Here. Come on.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.309
Thanks.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.320
Want to get drunk
and fool around?

23:25.404 --> 23:26.654
Oh, yeah.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.286
Mikey really loves his present.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.122
Where is he?

23:36.207 --> 23:37.332
Sitting in it.

23:40.503 --> 23:41.836
Good God.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.967
All right, Michael,
out of the boat!

23:48.969 --> 23:52.180
Tied up to the jetties,
sitting in the boat.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.723
I'm helping Michael.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.433
Get out of that boat!

23:55.518 --> 23:58.186
Hi, Dad.
Just a little longer. Please?

23:58.312 --> 23:59.771
It's his birthday.

23:59.855 --> 24:00.855
I don't want him on the ocean!

24:00.981 --> 24:02.732
He's not on the ocean,
he is in a boat.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.192
He won't go in the water.

24:04.318 --> 24:08.696
I don't think he'll go in the water again,
after what happened yesterday.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.408
All right, now don't say that.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.745
I don't want that to happen,
you know that.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.124
I want him to read
the boating regulations,

24:19.208 --> 24:22.377
the rules, before he goes out
on his own.

24:22.545 --> 24:26.840
Michael, did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

24:27.049 --> 24:28.216
Now!

24:35.099 --> 24:38.059
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.

24:39.353 --> 24:43.022
Don't worry. The Chief lives
on the other side of the island.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.400
Am I coming in straight?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.068
Don't worry about it.
Just keep rowing.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.162
We better catch something,

24:57.246 --> 24:59.414
this is my wife's holiday roast.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.207
Don't worry about it.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.293
$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.

25:11.260 --> 25:14.429
Come and get it.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.976
The tide's taking it right out.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.272
Can't we go home?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.168
He's taking it.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.921
Go!

26:59.952 --> 27:02.328
Charlie, take my word for it,
don't look back!

27:02.413 --> 27:04.038
Swim, Charlie!

27:06.375 --> 27:10.169
Come on! To me, boy!
Come on, Charlie! Swim!

27:10.254 --> 27:12.422
Come on, Charlie, keep coming.
Keep swimming.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.716
Come on, a little more.
Atta boy.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.011
I can't get up.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.721
Give me your hand, Charlie.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.807
Help me!

27:22.891 --> 27:24.976
Get your feet out of the water!

27:38.282 --> 27:40.074
Can we go home now?

27:49.084 --> 27:52.837
So then Denherder and Charlie sat there
trying to catch their breath

27:52.921 --> 27:55.173
and figure out
how to tell Charlie's wife

27:55.257 --> 27:57.216
what happened to her freezer
full of meat.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.969
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.722
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad
in <i>Field & Stream.</i>

28:02.806 --> 28:05.099
Looks more like
<i>The National Enquirer.</i>

28:07.102 --> 28:10.480
All right, hold it. Hold everything.
I said, hold it!

28:16.779 --> 28:17.737
Hello.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.281
Hello back, young fellow.
How are you?

28:21.116 --> 28:24.452
Say, I hope you're not going out
with those nuts, are you?

28:28.624 --> 28:30.583
The Weetock boats
gotta move out first.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.544
You have to move out
or he can't get out at all.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.923
Don't raise sail, you're going to luff it.
You got a paddle?

28:37.007 --> 28:38.758
- I got a paddle.
- Scull it out of here.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.386
Officer, wait a second.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.890
How many guys are you going
to put aboard that boat?

28:45.974 --> 28:47.392
Whatever's safe, right?

28:47.476 --> 28:48.726
Yeah, well that ain't safe.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.812
Watch it, that's dynamite.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.355
What are you doing with that?

28:52.481 --> 28:53.481
Where are you going with that?

28:53.565 --> 28:55.316
I'm going on the boat.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.152
Please, help me get those guys
out of the boat, will you?

28:58.237 --> 28:59.529
- Sure.
- Come on.

28:59.822 --> 29:03.241
Gentlemen, the officer asked me
to tell you

29:03.325 --> 29:04.575
that you're overloading that boat!

29:05.494 --> 29:07.078
Go on, get out of here.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.788
You ain't going.
What do you care?

29:08.872 --> 29:12.750
Can you tell me if there's
a good restaurant or hotel on the island?

29:12.835 --> 29:14.085
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.922
They're all going to die.

29:18.507 --> 29:21.592
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.845
You've got to get somebody to help us.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.806
Yeah, get those road block signs
out on the highway.

29:26.890 --> 29:30.184
Because we've got more people down here
than we can handle.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.438
What're you doing there?
These are your people. Go talk to them.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.440
They aren't my people.
They're from all over.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.400
You see all the license plates?

29:37.526 --> 29:40.903
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey.
I'm all by myself out there.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.488
What happened to the extra help...

29:42.573 --> 29:43.990
It's not until the Fourth of July.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.575
Till then, it's you and me.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.952
You know those guys
in the fan-tail launch?

29:48.036 --> 29:50.371
None of them are getting out
of the harbor alive.

29:50.456 --> 29:51.956
That's what I'm saying.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.125
You know their names.
Talk to those clowns.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.668
Everyone's having a good time today.

29:55.752 --> 29:56.878
Tell me about it.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.171
Polly, I'll get back to you.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.923
Could you tell me
how I could find Chief Brody?

30:01.008 --> 30:02.049
Who are you?

30:02.134 --> 30:05.094
Matt Hooper. I'm from
the Oceanographic Institute.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.723
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
You're the guy we called. I'm Brody.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.850
- Oh. I'm glad to meet you.
- Me, too.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.727
I know you got a lot on your hands.

30:12.811 --> 30:13.936
What can we do for you?

30:14.021 --> 30:16.814
The best thing to do
is to see the remains

30:16.899 --> 30:18.441
of the first victim,
the girl on the beach.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.151
Okay, fine.
Just bear with me, will you?

30:20.235 --> 30:21.360
Sure.

30:22.863 --> 30:25.865
Wait till we get them silly bastards
down in that rock pile.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.325
There'll be some fun.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.744
They'll wish their fathers
hadn't met their mothers

30:29.870 --> 30:31.579
when they start digging
the bottoms out

30:31.663 --> 30:33.831
and slamming into them rocks, boy.

30:33.916 --> 30:37.001
Get away from there,
you goddamn fool!

30:37.085 --> 30:38.252
What's the matter with you?

30:38.337 --> 30:41.088
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

30:41.673 --> 30:43.925
What are these guys
doing out here?

30:44.801 --> 30:46.302
What are they doing back there?

30:46.386 --> 30:47.845
They're chumming right now.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.055
What the hell is that?

30:49.139 --> 30:50.640
They're tracking the shark.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.684
$3,000 divided four ways is what?

30:55.270 --> 30:57.355
Watch your starboard. Jesus!

31:02.611 --> 31:05.196
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

31:07.950 --> 31:11.452
"Victim identified as Christine Watkins,
female Caucasian."

31:11.703 --> 31:12.828
And here's the way we have it.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.498
"Probable boating accident."

31:21.338 --> 31:23.047
The height and weight of the victim

31:23.131 --> 31:26.175
can only be estimated
from the partial remains.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.641
The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.226
There are no major organs remaining.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.894
May I have a glass of water?

31:36.979 --> 31:38.187
The right arm has been severed

31:38.272 --> 31:41.691
above the elbow
with massive tissue loss

31:42.025 --> 31:43.818
in the upper musculature.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.070
Thank you very much.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.826
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.953
Did you notify
the Coast Guard about this?

31:54.037 --> 31:56.831
No. It was only local jurisdiction.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.629
The left arm, head,
the shoulders, sternum

32:03.714 --> 32:05.131
and portions of the rib cage
are intact.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.842
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.262
This is what happens.

32:12.347 --> 32:15.516
Indicates the non-frenzy feeding
of a large <i>squalus</i>

32:15.601 --> 32:19.520
possibly <i>longimanus</i> or <i>Isurus glaucus.</i>

32:20.939 --> 32:24.275
The enormous amount of tissue loss
prevents any detailed analysis

32:24.359 --> 32:27.862
however, the attacking <i>squalus</i>
must be considerably larger

32:28.071 --> 32:30.448
than any normal <i>squalus</i>
found in these waters.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.825
Didn't you get out a boat
and check these waters?

32:32.909 --> 32:33.951
No.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.703
Well, this is not a boat accident.

32:36.038 --> 32:39.582
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.959
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.380
It was a shark.

33:03.231 --> 33:06.525
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I want to get on the state wire services.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.653
See if Boston will pick it up
and go national.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.029
Call Dave Axelrod in New York

33:10.113 --> 33:11.864
and tell him he owes me a favor.

33:11.948 --> 33:14.825
This is the shot I want with everybody
and the fish in it.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.161
Guys, could we please get organized?

33:17.412 --> 33:19.497
I want to get a picture for the paper.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.706
Now, can we just have the...

33:20.791 --> 33:22.333
Ben Gardner get this?

33:22.417 --> 33:24.085
No, we caught it.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.172
That's swell.

33:28.256 --> 33:29.590
It's a beauty.

33:30.801 --> 33:33.052
Guys, please,
I need a picture for the paper.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.553
Clear out of the way, please.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.556
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.059
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.853
Come on.
I need a picture for the paper.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.146
Could we get the sign, please?

33:48.151 --> 33:50.528
Kneel down, just like in high school.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.571
One row kneeling, one row standing.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.407
Come on, just get out of the way.

33:54.491 --> 33:56.784
Young fellow, could you step out
of the picture?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.619
Take your rake with you.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.789
- We're ready.
- Thank you.

34:02.791 --> 34:03.999
Can you get that, please.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.292
How's that?

34:11.967 --> 34:13.717
Larry, you won't believe it.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.219
What kind of a shark is that?

34:15.303 --> 34:16.469
I don't know.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.139
I think it's a mako.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.473
It's got a deep throat, Frank.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.600
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?

34:21.685 --> 34:22.810
Tiger shark.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.855
A what?

34:25.981 --> 34:27.440
We can start breathing again.

34:27.524 --> 34:28.733
Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?

34:28.817 --> 34:30.025
Oh, you bet he is.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.735
What is this bite radius crap?

34:31.820 --> 34:33.195
That is a big mouth.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.239
You stuff your frigging head
in there, man,

34:35.322 --> 34:38.324
and find out if it's a man-eater.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.831
All I'm saying is
that it may not be the shark.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.083
It's just a slight...

34:46.168 --> 34:49.628
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn, our mayor.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.589
Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.

34:51.672 --> 34:52.630
Nice to meet you.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.341
Terrific, huh, Mayor?

34:55.886 --> 34:58.721
There are all kinds of sharks
in the waters.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.015
Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.101
And the chances that these bozos
got the exact shark...

35:04.186 --> 35:06.103
There are no other sharks
like this here.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.105
It's 100-to-1.

35:08.690 --> 35:12.818
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

35:12.903 --> 35:15.738
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.365
But the fact is,
the bite radius on this animal

35:18.450 --> 35:20.910
is different than the wounds
on the victim.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.080
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.

35:25.165 --> 35:26.707
We all want to be sure, okay?

35:26.792 --> 35:28.417
What I want to do is very simple.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.295
The digestive system of this animal
is very slow.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.505
Let's cut it open.

35:32.589 --> 35:34.507
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours

35:34.591 --> 35:36.050
is bound to still be in there.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.093
And then we'll be sure.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.143
It may be the only way to confirm it.

35:46.228 --> 35:48.562
Look, fellows, let's be reasonable.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.273
This is not the time or the place

35:51.399 --> 35:54.944
to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.

35:55.821 --> 35:59.532
And I am not going to stand here
and see that thing cut open

35:59.616 --> 36:03.494
and see that little Kintner boy
spill out all over the dock.

36:17.759 --> 36:18.759
Chief Brody?

36:18.844 --> 36:19.844
Yes?

36:27.853 --> 36:29.645
I just found out

36:31.189 --> 36:33.941
that a girl got killed here last week.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.986
And you knew it.

36:37.946 --> 36:40.656
You knew there was a shark out there.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.618
You knew it was dangerous.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.621
But you let people
go swimming anyway.

36:52.002 --> 36:54.295
You knew all those things,

36:57.799 --> 37:00.050
but still my boy is dead now.

37:04.389 --> 37:07.308
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.565
My boy is dead.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.323
I wanted you to know that.

37:35.837 --> 37:38.213
I'm sorry, Martin.
She's wrong.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.425
No, she's not.

37:46.598 --> 37:47.848
All right, fellows

37:47.933 --> 37:49.892
let's cut this ugly
son of a bitch down

37:49.976 --> 37:51.894
before it stinks up
the whole island.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.731
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow
and dump it in the drink.

39:07.721 --> 39:09.096
Come here.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.934
Give us a kiss.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.144
Why?

39:17.731 --> 39:19.481
Because I need it.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.446
Get out of here.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.698
Can I help you?

39:27.782 --> 39:29.366
The door was open.
Mind if I come in?

39:29.451 --> 39:30.993
I'm Matt Hooper.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.536
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.121
- Your husband's home?
- Yes.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.831
I'd really like to talk to him.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.499
Yes, so would I.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.711
Come in.
Can I get you some coffee?

39:40.795 --> 39:42.004
No. Nothing, thank you.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.756
Oh, wine. How nice.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.359
How was your day?

40:10.241 --> 40:11.450
Swell.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.498
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.041
Oh, that's nice.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.294
Is anyone eating this?

40:22.378 --> 40:23.587
No.

40:31.805 --> 40:34.515
My husband tells me
you're in sharks.

40:37.143 --> 40:40.145
Excuse me. Yes.
I've never heard it quite put that way.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.730
But yes, I am.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.482
I love sharks.

40:43.566 --> 40:44.608
You love sharks?

40:44.692 --> 40:46.026
Yeah, I love them.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.362
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat

40:48.446 --> 40:50.197
and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.449
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in

40:52.534 --> 40:55.369
I hooked a 4.5 foot baby thresher shark

40:55.453 --> 40:57.079
who proceeded to eat my boat.

40:58.581 --> 41:02.209
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.669
He turned an inboard
into an outboard

41:03.753 --> 41:07.089
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.633
When I was on the beach,
I turned around

41:09.717 --> 41:11.677
and actually saw my boat
being taken apart.

41:11.761 --> 41:14.346
Ever since then,
I have been studying sharks

41:14.430 --> 41:18.183
and that's why I know that I'm going
to go to the Institute tomorrow

41:18.268 --> 41:20.853
and tell them that you still have
a shark problem here.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.896
- Why do you have to tell them that?
- Sorry.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.606
I'm sorry, I thought that...

41:24.691 --> 41:25.983
You told me the shark was caught.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.652
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.321
They caught a shark,
not the shark.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.408
Not the shark that killed
Chrissie Watkins.

41:34.617 --> 41:37.286
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

41:37.370 --> 41:40.164
Which I wanted to prove today
by cutting the shark open...

41:40.248 --> 41:43.333
You may want to let that breathe...
Nothing.

41:59.934 --> 42:03.270
You know, you'll be
the only rational man

42:03.354 --> 42:05.063
left on this island
after I leave tomorrow.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.316
Where are you going?

42:08.610 --> 42:10.360
I am going on the <i>Aurora.</i>

42:10.445 --> 42:11.862
The <i>Aurora?</i> What is that?

42:11.946 --> 42:14.865
It's a floating asylum
for shark addicts.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.992
It's pure research,
18 months at sea.

42:17.410 --> 42:20.954
Martin hates boats.
Martin hates water.

42:21.581 --> 42:25.667
Martin sits in his car
when we go on the ferry to the mainland.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.961
I guess it's a childhood thing.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.713
There's a clinical name for it,
isn't there?

42:29.797 --> 42:31.256
Drowning.

42:32.008 --> 42:33.967
Is it true that most people get attacked

42:34.052 --> 42:36.303
by sharks in three feet of water

42:36.387 --> 42:38.013
about 10 feet from the beach?

42:38.097 --> 42:39.181
Yeah.

42:39.766 --> 42:43.310
And that before people
started to swim for recreation...

42:43.394 --> 42:46.563
I mean, before sharks knew
what they were missing

42:46.648 --> 42:49.942
that a lot of these attacks
weren't reported?

42:50.026 --> 42:51.276
That's right.

42:53.363 --> 42:56.156
Now this shark that swims alone

42:56.282 --> 42:57.449
- what's it called?
- Rogue.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.951
Rogue, yeah.

42:59.410 --> 43:02.496
This guy, he keeps swimming around

43:02.580 --> 43:04.373
in a place where the feeding is good

43:04.457 --> 43:06.333
until the food supply is gone, right?

43:06.417 --> 43:07.918
That's called territoriality.

43:08.002 --> 43:11.255
It's just a theory that
I happen to agree with.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.425
Then why don't we have
one more drink

43:15.510 --> 43:18.011
and go down
and cut that shark open?

43:18.513 --> 43:21.223
Martin? Can you do that?

43:25.061 --> 43:28.063
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.

43:34.570 --> 43:37.197
We start in the alimentary canal

43:38.700 --> 43:41.243
and open the digestive tract.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.149
Just like I thought.

44:12.233 --> 44:13.233
What?

44:14.235 --> 44:17.571
Came up in the Gulf Stream,
from southern waters.

44:22.869 --> 44:24.161
He didn't eat a car, did he?

44:24.245 --> 44:25.370
No.

44:25.705 --> 44:28.457
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.

44:28.541 --> 44:31.501
Somebody probably threw that
in the river.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.176
That's it.

44:41.012 --> 44:44.097
I've got to close the beach,
call the Mayor.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.309
You got a bigger problem than that, Martin.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.936
You still got a hell of a fish out there

44:50.021 --> 44:51.813
with a mouth about this big.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.487
How do we confirm that by morning?

44:59.322 --> 45:03.325
If he is a rogue,
and there's any truth to territoriality at all

45:03.409 --> 45:05.202
we got a good chance of spotting him

45:05.286 --> 45:06.995
between Cape Scott and South Beach.

45:07.080 --> 45:08.205
Where are you going?

45:08.289 --> 45:09.706
To find him.
He's a night feeder.

45:09.832 --> 45:10.832
On the water?

45:10.917 --> 45:12.417
We're not gonna find him on the land.

45:12.502 --> 45:13.877
I'm not drunk enough
to go on a boat.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.003
Yes, you are.

45:15.088 --> 45:16.380
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

45:16.464 --> 45:17.923
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

45:27.100 --> 45:30.727
I'm telling you, the crime rate in New York
will kill you.

45:30.812 --> 45:34.731
There's so many problems,
you never feel like you're accomplishing anything.

45:34.816 --> 45:37.818
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.069
The kids can't leave the house.

45:39.153 --> 45:41.279
You've got to walk them to school.

45:41.364 --> 45:44.366
But in Amity,
one man can make a difference.

45:44.867 --> 45:47.077
In 25 years, there's never been

45:47.161 --> 45:48.829
a shooting or a murder in this town.

45:49.705 --> 45:52.207
No kidding? Want a pretzel?

45:52.959 --> 45:54.167
Where are we?

45:54.252 --> 45:57.254
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.591
Can you get <i>The Late Show</i>
on this thing?

46:01.676 --> 46:03.260
No, it's a closed circuit TV system.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.887
I have underwater cameras fore-and-aft.

46:06.514 --> 46:08.223
Who pays for all this stuff?

46:08.307 --> 46:09.724
The government? The Institute?

46:09.809 --> 46:11.852
This stuff costs a lot of money.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.772
I paid for this mostly myself, actually.

46:15.857 --> 46:17.649
- You're kidding.
- No.

46:18.317 --> 46:19.985
- You rich?
- Yeah.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.154
How much?

46:22.238 --> 46:23.738
Personally, or the whole family?

46:25.199 --> 46:29.327
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?

46:29.745 --> 46:33.206
Well, it doesn't make sense for a guy

46:33.291 --> 46:34.833
who hates the water
to live on an island either.

46:35.626 --> 46:38.712
It's only an island
if you look at it from the water.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.755
That makes a lot of sense.

46:46.721 --> 46:48.472
What is that thing doing?

46:49.849 --> 46:51.892
Well, it's a fish finder.

46:51.976 --> 46:54.060
It's probably just
a school of mackerel or something,

46:54.145 --> 46:56.146
all clumped together.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.192
Wait a minute.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.406
There's something else out there.

47:06.491 --> 47:07.824
What is it?

47:08.326 --> 47:10.869
About 100 yards, south-southwest.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.280
That's Ben Gardner's boat.

47:47.365 --> 47:48.615
You know him?

47:48.699 --> 47:52.285
It's all banged up.
Sure I know him. He's a fisherman.

47:53.871 --> 47:55.413
What happened?

48:01.504 --> 48:03.755
Martin, I gotta go down
and check their hull.

48:03.839 --> 48:05.924
Wait. Why don't we just tow it all in?

48:06.008 --> 48:08.635
We will.
I just got to check something out.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.554
Hit the lights for me.

48:34.996 --> 48:36.204
Let's tow it in.

48:36.289 --> 48:39.457
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's going to happen.

48:44.213 --> 48:46.381
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

48:46.465 --> 48:49.009
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.635
Don't touch any of the equipment.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.181
I'll be back in two minutes.

50:22.645 --> 50:24.729
This is a great white, Larry.
A big one.

50:24.814 --> 50:27.691
Any shark expert will tell you
it's a killer, a man-eater.

50:27.775 --> 50:30.527
The situation is that apparently
a great white shark

50:30.611 --> 50:32.904
has staked a claim
in the waters off Amity Island.

50:32.988 --> 50:36.199
He'll continue to feed here
as long as there's food in the water.

50:36.283 --> 50:37.867
There's no limit
to what he'll do.

50:37.952 --> 50:39.327
We've had three incidents.

50:39.412 --> 50:41.830
Two people killed within a week.
It'll happen again.

50:41.914 --> 50:43.998
It happened before.
The Jersey beach, 1916.

50:44.125 --> 50:46.042
- Five people were killed...
- In one week.

50:46.127 --> 50:47.377
Tell him about the swimmers.

50:47.461 --> 50:50.714
A shark is attracted to the exact kind
of splashing and activity

50:50.798 --> 50:53.633
that occurs whenever human beings swim.
You can't avoid it.

50:53.718 --> 50:57.387
Opening the beaches on the Fourth of July
is like ringing the dinner bell.

50:57.471 --> 50:58.847
Look, Mr. Vaughn

50:58.931 --> 51:01.641
I pulled a tooth
the size of a shot glass

51:01.726 --> 51:03.268
out of the wrecked hull
of a boat out there.

51:03.352 --> 51:04.853
It was the tooth of a great white.

51:04.937 --> 51:06.604
It was Gardner's boat, all chewed up.

51:06.689 --> 51:08.982
I helped tow it in.
You should've seen it!

51:09.066 --> 51:11.818
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

51:12.194 --> 51:13.820
I didn't see it.
He dropped it on the way in.

51:13.904 --> 51:15.947
I had an accident.

51:16.115 --> 51:19.284
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?

51:20.619 --> 51:23.538
It's a <i>Carcharodon carcharias.</i>
It's a great white.

51:23.748 --> 51:25.707
You don't have the tooth?

51:26.959 --> 51:29.794
Look, we depend on the summer people
for our very lives...

51:29.879 --> 51:32.964
You won't have a summer
unless you deal with this problem!

51:33.048 --> 51:36.217
We have to close the beach
and hire someone to kill the shark!

51:36.302 --> 51:38.094
We have to tell the Coast Guard.

51:38.179 --> 51:41.139
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

51:41.223 --> 51:43.516
You'll have to ring
this entire harbor!

51:43.601 --> 51:45.310
I don't think either one of you

51:45.394 --> 51:47.103
are familiar with our problems!

51:47.188 --> 51:49.397
I think that I am familiar
with the fact

51:49.482 --> 51:51.649
that you'll ignore
this particular problem

51:51.734 --> 51:54.068
until it swims up
and bites you in the ass!

51:54.153 --> 51:57.155
Wait a second!
There are two ways to deal with this problem!

51:57.239 --> 52:00.366
You either kill this animal
or cut off its food supply.

52:00.451 --> 52:02.327
We have to close the beaches.

52:02.411 --> 52:03.536
Brody?

52:04.121 --> 52:06.164
Sick vandalism.

52:06.248 --> 52:10.335
That is a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.

52:10.628 --> 52:13.546
I want those little
paint-happy bastards caught

52:13.631 --> 52:15.340
and hung up by their Buster Browns.

52:15.424 --> 52:18.468
That's it. I won't waste my time
arguing with a man

52:18.552 --> 52:19.761
who's lining up to be a hot lunch.

52:19.845 --> 52:21.137
I'm gonna see you later, Brody.

52:21.222 --> 52:23.306
Don't do this. He's not...

52:29.939 --> 52:34.776
What we are dealing with here
is a perfect engine, an eating machine.

52:35.361 --> 52:37.070
It's really a miracle of evolution.

52:37.154 --> 52:40.990
All this machine does
is swim and eat

52:41.242 --> 52:43.743
and make little sharks.
And that's all.

52:43.953 --> 52:46.746
Why don't you take a long,
close look at this sign?

52:46.831 --> 52:48.998
Those proportions are correct.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.333
You'd love to prove that,
wouldn't you?

52:50.417 --> 52:53.378
Get your name into the
<i>National Geographic.</i>

53:04.765 --> 53:06.641
Larry, if we make an effort today,

53:06.725 --> 53:08.560
we might be able to save August.

53:08.644 --> 53:10.645
August? For Christ's sake,

53:10.729 --> 53:12.188
tomorrow's the Fourth of July!

53:12.273 --> 53:14.190
We will be open for business.

53:14.275 --> 53:16.192
It'll be one of the best summers
we've ever had.

53:16.277 --> 53:18.236
If you are concerned
about the beaches,

53:18.320 --> 53:20.530
do whatever you have to,
to make them safe.

53:20.614 --> 53:23.825
But those beaches will be open
for this weekend.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.808
I want to know how many men
you're going to send.

53:48.893 --> 53:51.102
There is no need for me
to come to Brisbane

53:51.186 --> 53:53.730
when I have a great white shark
right here!

53:53.898 --> 53:56.065
<i>We need men to patrol
the swimming area.</i>

53:56.150 --> 53:59.235
<i>We've got to have help.
Anybody with a gun or a boat.</i>

54:12.833 --> 54:13.958
Monday!

54:15.210 --> 54:17.420
Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?

54:17.504 --> 54:19.589
He's the little guy
with a crew cut.

54:36.857 --> 54:39.233
Operator, isn't there a phone
on the island?

54:39.318 --> 54:40.526
Could you connect me, please?

54:47.993 --> 54:50.203
Come on, get him!

54:52.206 --> 54:53.831
Careful on the beach.

54:55.834 --> 54:58.211
Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?

54:59.546 --> 55:02.215
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

55:02.341 --> 55:04.676
All right.
I'll get to them later.

55:07.972 --> 55:10.348
Brody to Scutbucket,
please come in.

55:17.398 --> 55:19.065
Brody to Daisy,
do you read me?

55:19.149 --> 55:20.733
<i>Fascinating Rhythm,
do you read me?</i>

55:20.818 --> 55:22.485
<i>Come in, Hooper.
What do you see?</i>

55:22.569 --> 55:25.363
Nothing here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

55:25.739 --> 55:29.575
Amity Island has long been known
for its clean air, clear water

55:29.702 --> 55:31.869
and beautiful white-sand beaches.

55:32.204 --> 55:33.496
But in recent days

55:33.580 --> 55:35.248
a cloud has appeared on the horizon

55:35.332 --> 55:37.250
of this beautiful resort community.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.752
A cloud in the shape
of a killer shark.

55:48.220 --> 55:50.596
<i>That is very shocking
in the outfield.</i>

55:50.681 --> 55:54.517
<i>Two balls, one strike,
runners at first and third...</i>

55:56.270 --> 55:58.438
<i>Fly ball, deep left field.</i>

55:58.522 --> 56:02.108
<i>Jerry Christian goes back,
running back near the wall</i>

56:02.234 --> 56:04.110
<i>and he takes it for the out.</i>

56:09.616 --> 56:11.159
Oh, hi, Larry.

56:11.243 --> 56:12.744
Why aren't you in the water?

56:14.621 --> 56:16.831
I just put some suntan lotion on,

56:16.915 --> 56:18.791
and I'm trying to absorb some...

56:18.917 --> 56:20.626
Nobody's going in.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.796
Please, get in the water.

57:19.520 --> 57:21.104
Mike, come here.

57:24.942 --> 57:26.943
Listen, Mike.
Do me a favor, will you?

57:27.027 --> 57:28.236
You and the other guys
take the boat

57:28.320 --> 57:30.863
and put it in the pond instead?

57:31.698 --> 57:33.199
The pond is for old ladies.

57:33.283 --> 57:34.408
I know it's for the old ladies,

57:34.493 --> 57:36.786
but just do it for the old man.

57:36.870 --> 57:37.870
Please?

57:37.955 --> 57:38.955
All right.

57:39.790 --> 57:41.040
Thanks.

57:53.387 --> 57:55.221
I've got Sean.

57:59.143 --> 58:01.811
Michael! Wait!

58:04.565 --> 58:06.732
Michael, I don't like you no more.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.536
I can stand Harry, you know...

58:32.509 --> 58:35.344
Daisy, this is Hendricks.
Anything?

58:35.429 --> 58:36.762
Thought I saw a shadow. Over.

58:37.431 --> 58:40.516
<i>Hendricks, this is Daisy here.
I don't see anything.</i>

58:42.060 --> 58:44.270
False alarm.
Must be this glare.

58:55.532 --> 58:59.202
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news
that we have in fact

58:59.286 --> 59:01.787
caught and killed a large predator

59:01.872 --> 59:03.789
that supposedly injured some bathers.

59:03.916 --> 59:05.625
As you see,
it's a beautiful day.

59:05.709 --> 59:09.045
The beaches are open,
and people are having a wonderful time.

59:09.129 --> 59:11.714
"Amity," as you know,
means "friendship."

59:25.896 --> 59:27.104
My God!

59:36.657 --> 59:39.325
Jesus Christ!
Fin! Shark! 350!

59:41.745 --> 59:42.995
<i>Get in there as fast as you can!</i>

59:43.080 --> 59:44.288
Red one.

59:44.790 --> 59:47.333
<i>Martin, get them
the hell out of the water.</i>

59:52.297 --> 59:54.090
No whistles!

59:54.258 --> 59:56.133
<i>Everybody, please,
get out of the water.</i>

59:56.218 --> 59:57.677
<i>Everybody out of the water.</i>

59:57.761 --> 01:00:02.181
<i>Don't push!
Everybody out of the water, please.</i>

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.179
Come on!

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.493
<i>I want them out of there, guys.</i>

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.496
<i>Give an answer, please.
What's going on out there?</i>

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:14.211
He made me do it.
He talked me into it.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:18.591
Please, move back.
Give these people some air.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.926
Please, move back.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:25.598
Martin, it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.

01:01:25.766 --> 01:01:29.393
Is everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:35.274
<i>Folks, we had some practical joker
down there with a fake fin...</i>

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:38.069
Shark! A shark!

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:42.031
It's going into the pond!
Shark in estuary!

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:43.282
Now what?

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.452
Michael's in the pond.

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:51.415
It's going in the pond!
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:04.845
Hurry up, get that done.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.138
I can't do a damn thing.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:09.058
Get that rope undone.
You gotta untangle that up there.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.434
I'm doing it!

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:15.648
Hey, fellows, haul in your sheet.
Make it fast.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:22.238
You guys okay over there?

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:23.823
In the pond!

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.992
Somebody get a gun and shoot it!

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.535
Doesn't anybody have a gun?

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.476
Is he dead?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.561
No, he's not. He's in shock.

01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:08.844
Doctor said he's okay.
Mild shock.

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:10.012
He can go home in the morning.

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:11.430
Thank you.

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:14.099
How's my big kid?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.184
I'm all right.

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:18.020
You going to miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:19.355
Want me to bring anything from home?

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:20.689
My cars.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:21.774
What about ice cream?

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:22.858
Coffee.

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:36.956
Want to take him home?

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.793
Back to New York?

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:43.087
No. Home, here.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.857
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.777
You got a pen, Larry?

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.196
Yeah, a pen, you know.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.827
'Cause you're going to do
what you do best.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.955
You're going to sign this voucher
so I can hire a contractor.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.915
I don't know
if I can do that without...

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.960
I'm going to hire Quint
to kill the shark.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.753
- August?
- What?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.464
What are you talking about?

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:29.967
Summer's over.
You're the mayor of Shark City.

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:31.885
People think you want the beaches open.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:35.598
I was acting in
the town's best interest.

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.891
You were acting in
the town's best interest.

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:39.893
That's why you'll do the right thing.

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:41.228
That's why you're going to sign this,

01:05:41.313 --> 01:05:44.356
and we'll pay that guy
what he wants.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.904
My kids were on that beach, too.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.334
Sign it, Larry.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:14.386
<i>$10,000.</i>

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:16.764
<i>$200 a day,
whether I catch him or not.</i>

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:17.890
<i>You've got it.</i>

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:21.393
Get the Mayor off my back
so I don't have more of this zoning crap.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:22.895
You've got that.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:26.732
One case of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:30.069
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.404
Champagne, <i>pâte de foie gras,</i>

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.074
Iranian caviar,
and don't forget the color TV.

01:06:38.578 --> 01:06:42.706
Chief, you try this. Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.249
Thanks.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.711
Here's to swimming
with bow-legged women.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:56.595
Excuse me, Chief.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.946
Can't get a good man these days,
under 60.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.448
All gone at least 35 years.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:17.950
Don't drink that.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.284
Mr. Quint...

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.332
You're gonna need an extra hand.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.126
- This is Matt Hooper.
- I know who he is.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.210
I've crewed three Trans Pacs.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.294
Transplants?

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.796
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.756
And an America's Cup trial.

01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:34.383
Mr. Hooper, I'm not talking

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.177
about pleasure boating
or day-sailing.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:41.724
I'm talking about working for a living.
I'm talking about sharking.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:45.102
I'm not talking about hooking
some poor dogfish or sand shark.

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:47.271
I'm talking about finding a great white.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.648
Porkers? Talking about porkers?

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:56.822
Just tie me a sheepshank.

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:02.661
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship
in a long time.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:06.498
You didn't say how short you wanted it.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.085
How's that?

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:15.007
Give me your hands.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.135
Dogfish?

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:21.596
You got a $5,000 net
and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.725
Along comes Mr. Whitey,
and when he's finished with that net

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.393
it looks like a kiddies' scissors class

01:08:26.478 --> 01:08:28.770
has cut it up for a paper doll.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:32.441
You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.443
You been counting money
all your life.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:38.029
I don't need this.
I don't need this working-class-hero crap.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:41.908
You're not going to do this aboard the ship
are you, Mr. Quint?

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:45.537
Maybe I should go alone.

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:50.542
It's my party. It's my charter.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:54.046
Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party.
It's my vessel.

01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:58.050
You're on board my vessel,
I'm mate, master, pilot

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:00.385
and I'm captain.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.890
I'll take him for ballast, Chief.

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:09.812
You got him.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:13.607
"Straight-jet, killing lance.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:18.654
"Tail rope, eye splice, M-1,
handy billy, pliers, irons..."

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:22.616
Sample bottles, dye marker,
flares, safety float

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:25.452
temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:28.747
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.759
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure, all right?

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.515
Jesus H. Christ!

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:50.269
When I was a boy,
every squirt wanted

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:53.020
to be a harpooner
or a swordfisherman.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:57.192
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?

01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:58.694
An anti-shark cage.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:00.320
Anti-shark cage?

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.282
You go inside the cage?

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:10.122
Cage goes in the water? You go in the water?
Shark's in the water.

01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:12.624
Our shark.

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:19.172
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:23.844
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:29.808
<i>For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston</i>

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:35.397
<i>And so nevermore
shall we see you again</i>

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:43.363
Did you take your Dramamine?

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:44.489
Yes.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:48.744
I put an extra pair of glasses
in your black socks

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.537
and there's the stuff
for your nose,

01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:53.248
the zinc oxide and Blistex
is in the kit.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.000
Son of a bitch!

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.378
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothing.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.339
Young girls just ain't quite smart

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:01.882
like their grandmothers were.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:03.842
That's got to be Quint.

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:05.469
Colorful, isn't he?

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:06.845
He scares me.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:11.391
Don't use the fireplace in the den...

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.685
What am I going
to tell the kids?

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:18.857
Tell them I'm going fishing.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:27.199
Break it up, will you, Chief?
Daylight's wasting!

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:31.703
Front, bow. Back, stern.

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:34.539
Better get it right, squirt,
or I throw your ass

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.541
out the little round window
on the side!

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:39.753
Come on, Chief.
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.747
See you got your rubbers.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:49.221
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee
Died at the age of 103

01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:52.307
"For 15 years she kept her virginity

01:11:52.392 --> 01:11:54.559
"Not a bad record for this vicinity"

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:58.480
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt!

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.818
If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow!

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:10.742
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.
Stand by fire drill.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.412
Damage control report.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:16.581
Nor'easter coming,
bad news for Madison Avenue.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:19.042
I'm tired of that.

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:20.836
How's the missus, Chief?

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:25.465
If they don't like you going out,
they'll love you coming in.

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:52.576
Keep that chum line going, Chief.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.454
We got five good miles on it.

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:58.040
Who's driving this boat?

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.624
Nobody. The tide.

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:03.545
One time, I caught
a 16-footer off Montauk.

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:05.047
Had to stick two barrels in him.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.966
Two to wear him down
and bring him up.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.802
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:14.723
Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.144
Jesus H. Christ.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:22.898
Chief, best drop another chum marker.

01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:47.464
Damn it, Martin!

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.883
This is compressed air.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:51.510
What the hell kind of a knot was that?

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.261
You pulled the wrong one!

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:54.596
You screw around with these tanks,

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.765
and they're going to blow up.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.892
Yeah, that's real fine,
expensive gear

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:01.478
you've brought out here, Mr. Hooper.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:04.439
I don't know what that bastard shark's
going to do with it.

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:05.982
Might eat it, I suppose.

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:08.610
Seen one eat a rocking chair one time.

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:16.076
Next time, you just ask me
which line to pull, right?

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:24.334
Little brown eel
comes out of the cave

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:27.129
swims into the hole

01:14:28.548 --> 01:14:31.800
comes out of the hole,
goes back into the cave again.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:34.636
It's not too good, is it?

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:38.223
Nothing's easy, is it?
One more time.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.183
Little brown eel...

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:00.513
I got it!

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:04.226
- What?
- Get behind me.

01:16:07.647 --> 01:16:09.397
Hooper, reverse her!

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:12.234
Taking a hell of a lot of line!

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:15.779
Chief, get the scoop out of the bucket!
Wet the reel!

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:21.660
Hooper, reverse her!

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.750
Duck your head down. We're swinging.
Get behind me again.

01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:32.003
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:36.049
Hooper, you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watching it!

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:41.513
Hooper, neutral.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.689
Where'd he go now?

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.275
He ain't fooling me.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.403
What's he yanking on now?

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.863
Go on, try it.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.546
I don't know, Chief,
if he's very smart or very dumb.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:22.721
Jesus...

01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:27.892
He's gone under.

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.896
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.

01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:34.232
Yeah, it's too easy.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:37.610
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:41.364
Keep her steady, now.
I got something very big!

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:42.991
I don't think so.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.119
Chief, put your gloves on.

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:49.289
You put your gloves on,
both of you!

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:54.002
Getting ready to run out again.

01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:56.379
Quint, let it go.

01:17:56.464 --> 01:17:59.174
Maybe you're a big yahoo in the lab,

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:00.550
but out here
you're just supercargo!

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:03.386
If you don't want to backstroke home,
you get down here!

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:06.389
You don't want to listen to me,
don't listen to me.

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:07.682
It's not a shark.

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:09.809
The wire's showing.

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.353
Unbuckle me.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:13.855
Get the other side.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.482
It's a tuna or swordfish

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:17.901
wasting our time.

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:20.111
Take this rod.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:21.863
Hooper, give the Chief a hand,
will you?

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:22.989
Right!

01:18:23.074 --> 01:18:24.115
Oh, shit!

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:37.003
It may be a marlin or a stingray

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.839
but it's definitely a game fish.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:52.977
Gaming fish?

01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:57.065
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?

01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:58.858
Don't you tell me
my business again.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:00.151
You get back on the bridge.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.779
Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:04.989
It proves one thing, Mr. Hooper.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:08.243
You wealthy college boys
don't have the education enough

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.078
to admit if you're wrong.

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:22.215
What's the point?
Hooks and lines?

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:27.137
You lose one, you rig one.

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:34.310
Twelve minutes, south-southeast, now!
Full throttle!

01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:35.895
Aye-aye, sir!

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:41.317
You see, what I do, Chief,
is I trick them to the surface.

01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:43.445
And then I jab at them.

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:47.198
I'm not going to haul them up
like a lot of catfish.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:49.117
Hooper, full throttle!

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:51.870
I don't have to take this abuse
much longer.

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:54.998
Your head's bleeding.
First aid there.

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:26.404
Start that chum line again, will you?

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:30.700
Let Hooper take a turn.

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:32.702
Hooper drives the boat, Chief.

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:50.512
Stop playing with yourself, Hooper.

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:52.263
Slow ahead, if you please.

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:55.183
You heard him. Slow ahead.

01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:05.193
Slow ahead.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:09.531
I can go slow ahead.
Come on down and chum some of this shit.

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.592
You're going to need a bigger boat.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.317
Shut off that engine.

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.471
That's a 20-footer.

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:16.764
Twenty-five.

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:19.434
Three tons of him.

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.108
We're going to need
a bigger boat, right?

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.610
Gotta get to work.

01:22:29.153 --> 01:22:31.446
How do we handle this?

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.698
Come up front, Martin.
I need you.

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:37.660
He's circling the boat.

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:54.802
<i>This is Amity Point Light Station to</i> Orca.

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.054
<i>Come in,</i> Orca.

01:22:56.889 --> 01:22:58.056
<i>Orca.</i> Come in.

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:00.058
<i>I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.</i>

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.351
Put her on.

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:03.936
Come on, Martin! Move!

01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:05.396
I'm not going out there!

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:06.939
Beyond the edge of the barrels.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:10.068
Go to the end of the barrels,
further out.

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:11.736
- Further out!
- Why?

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.571
- Go further out!
- What for?

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.406
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:16.491
What?

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:17.659
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:20.662
I need something in the foreground
to give it some scale!

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:21.996
Foreground my ass!

01:23:22.081 --> 01:23:23.998
Your husband's okay.
He's fishing.

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.249
He just caught some stripers.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:29.087
We'll bring them for dinner.
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.588
I'm not staying here!

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:31.673
I'm begging you!

01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:35.051
God damn it!
Come here, darling.

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:42.684
Chief, I want you up on the bridge,

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:44.018
just take her forward, steady.

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:45.561
I've never steered a boat in my life.

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:48.398
Just watch my hand,
take her steady.

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:52.360
Mr. Hooper, attach the end of this line
to the first keg.

01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:55.446
I've got to get a good shot
at that porker's head.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:13.256
He's coming.

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:16.092
Hooper? Get clear of the bow.

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:22.223
Hurry up, will you?

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:23.474
Your turn, Quint.

01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:25.685
Hooper, where are you?

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.649
Hurry it up now, tie it on.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:35.403
He's coming straight for us.
Don't screw it up now.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:36.988
Don't wait for me.

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:42.493
Come on, Hooper, hurry it up!
Tie it on!

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:44.662
Now.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.709
Kill it!

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:51.961
Now!

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:54.964
Shoot!

01:24:58.218 --> 01:24:59.385
Time.

01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:02.430
What were you doing?
You knew I had

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:04.932
to get a clean shot
right in the head.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:08.644
All right, let's see how long
that barrel takes to bring him up.

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.524
Bring another barrel!
I'm coming around again!

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:09.372
What do we do now?
We're quitting, right?

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:13.459
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:16.212
We could radio in
and get a bigger boat...

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.364
Don't you worry about it, Chief.

01:26:44.283 --> 01:26:47.618
It won't be permanent.
You want to see something permanent?

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.795
You want to feel something permanent?

01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:02.967
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:06.220
Knocko Nolans, St. Patty's Day, Boston.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.226
I got that beat.

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:23.654
It's a moray eel.
It bit right through my wet suit.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.741
Well, Hoop, now, listen

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:30.077
I don't know about that,
but I entered an arm-wrestling contest

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.914
in a bar in San Francisco.
See this?

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:34.540
I can't extend that.
You know why?

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:36.876
'Cause in the semi-final

01:27:37.044 --> 01:27:39.879
celebrating my third wife's demise,

01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:41.923
big Chinese fellow,
he pulled me right over.

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:56.354
Look at that.

01:27:58.023 --> 01:27:59.565
That's a bull shark.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:02.526
He scraped me when I was taking samples.

01:28:03.362 --> 01:28:05.363
I got something for you.

01:28:06.073 --> 01:28:09.533
There's a thresher. You see that?
A thresher's tail.

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:11.744
- Thresher?
- It's a shark.

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.791
You want a drink?
Drink to your leg?

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:17.875
I'll drink to your leg.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.744
So we drink to our legs.

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:28.552
I got <i>the crème de la crème.</i>
Right here. Hold on.

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:31.305
Here, you see that?

01:28:31.723 --> 01:28:33.432
You're wearing a sweater.

01:28:34.226 --> 01:28:36.560
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:39.480
She broke my heart.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:51.158
What's that one?

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.660
What?

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:54.203
That one, there.
On your arm.

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:58.499
A tattoo. I got that removed.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:00.292
Don't tell me.

01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:02.161
"Mother."

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:09.468
What is it?

01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:17.643
Mr. Hooper, that's the
<i>U.S.S. Indianapolis.</i>

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.153
You were on the <i>Indianapolis?</i>

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.612
What happened?

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:34.660
Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes
into her side, Chief.

01:29:35.996 --> 01:29:39.874
I was coming back
from the island of Tinian to Leyte

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:43.085
just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.

01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:49.008
1,100 men went into the water.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:50.926
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.

01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:56.223
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

01:29:56.475 --> 01:29:58.392
Tiger, 13-footer.

01:29:58.477 --> 01:30:01.353
You know how you know that
when you're in the water, Chief?

01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:04.690
You tell by looking
from the dorsal to the tail.

01:30:06.276 --> 01:30:08.152
Well, we didn't know.

01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:11.655
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret

01:30:12.449 --> 01:30:14.825
no distress signal had been sent.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.543
They didn't even list us overdue
for a week.

01:30:26.004 --> 01:30:29.507
Very first light,
sharks come cruising

01:30:30.008 --> 01:30:32.927
so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

01:30:33.804 --> 01:30:36.639
You know, kind of like old squares

01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:38.307
in a battle like you see
on a calendar

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:41.185
like the Battle of Waterloo.
The idea was...

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:42.895
the shark comes to the nearest man

01:30:42.979 --> 01:30:45.773
and he starts pounding,
hollering and screaming.

01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:48.484
Sometimes the shark
would go away...

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:51.445
but sometimes he wouldn't go away.

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:55.783
Sometimes that shark, he looks
right into you, right into your eyes.

01:30:57.244 --> 01:30:59.870
You know, a thing about a shark,
he's got...

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:04.333
lifeless eyes.
Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:09.463
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to be living

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:14.718
until he bites you.
Those black eyes roll over white and then...

01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:19.723
Then you hear
that terrible high-pitched screaming.

01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:22.059
The ocean turns red.

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:26.313
In spite of the pounding and the hollering,
they all come in.

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.733
They rip you to pieces.

01:31:34.573 --> 01:31:37.575
You know, by the end of that first dawn...

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:40.369
we lost 100 men.

01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:44.415
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:47.585
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:51.172
On Thursday morning,
I bumped into a friend of mine...

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:53.674
Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.

01:31:54.885 --> 01:31:57.511
Baseball player, bosun's mate.

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:03.642
I thought he was asleep.
Reached over to wake him up.

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:09.106
He bobbed up and down in the water
just like a kind of top.

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:11.066
Upended.

01:32:15.113 --> 01:32:17.781
He'd been bitten in half,
below the waist.

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:25.706
Noon the fifth day,
a Lockheed Ventura saw us.

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.918
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.

01:32:29.002 --> 01:32:30.211
Younger than Mr. Hooper.

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:33.130
He saw us and he came in low,
and three hours later...

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:36.717
a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:39.637
That was the time
I was most frightened.

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:42.139
Waiting for my turn.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:46.268
I'll never put on
a life jacket again.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:50.439
So, 1,100 men went into the water

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:53.067
316 men come out.

01:32:53.151 --> 01:32:57.112
The sharks took the rest,
June 29, 1945.

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:03.827
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:18.175
What's that?

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:19.510
It's a whale.

01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:26.475
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

01:33:27.978 --> 01:33:32.898
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

01:33:37.195 --> 01:33:41.240
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:46.829
<i>I'm tired and I want to go to bed</i>

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:53.127
<i>I had a little drink
about an hour ago</i>

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:57.339
<i>And it's gone right to my head</i>

01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:02.594
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

01:34:03.596 --> 01:34:07.391
<i>By land, or sea or foam</i>

01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:12.938
<i>You will always hear me
singing this song</i>

01:34:14.024 --> 01:34:16.776
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:22.040
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

01:34:22.115 --> 01:34:25.242
<i>I'm tired and I want to go to bed</i>

01:34:25.327 --> 01:34:27.911
<i>I had a little drink
about an hour ago</i>

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:30.331
<i>And it's gone right to my head</i>

01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:32.833
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:35.586
<i>On land or sea or foam</i>

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:39.006
<i>You can always hear me singing...</i>

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.594
Start the engines.

01:34:53.772 --> 01:34:56.148
Fire her up!
Right in the middle!

01:34:56.274 --> 01:34:58.609
He's busting the shaft.

01:35:03.656 --> 01:35:05.491
Put out the fire, will you?

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:16.794
- Pump her out.
- Done.

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:26.720
Everybody on deck.

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:27.930
He ate the light.

01:35:28.014 --> 01:35:29.598
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:35.104
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:36.563
Quint, come on.

01:35:36.648 --> 01:35:38.357
What's wrong with this?

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:44.571
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.

01:36:02.298 --> 01:36:03.632
You okay?

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:33.120
Chief, more left rudder!

01:36:34.122 --> 01:36:35.706
Pull your left hand down.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:38.834
I can't. It'll only go
about three inches.

01:36:39.002 --> 01:36:40.794
All of our injectors got scored

01:36:40.879 --> 01:36:42.796
from the salt water in the fuel.

01:36:43.673 --> 01:36:46.258
Yeah, the housing's bent,
you can hear it.

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:51.597
Try the left rudder again.
More left. Good. Once again now.

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:56.310
Quint, there it is.

01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:58.979
What do you say, Chief?

01:36:59.189 --> 01:37:01.773
The barrel is up,
it's right in the stern.

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:09.198
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.

01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:23.003
Quint, if we can get close enough...

01:37:24.422 --> 01:37:26.173
I've got things on board
that'll kill it.

01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:29.134
Just want to goose him up.
Come on.

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.691
When he runs, you drop that rope
or you'll lose your hands.

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:48.195
I've seen fingers
torn out at the knuckles.

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:50.280
Whole sea's bones, full of them.

01:37:50.365 --> 01:37:52.282
Give it to me a minute.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:10.259
Haul in that line
or it'll foul us.

01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:12.427
Start the engine.

01:38:14.764 --> 01:38:16.348
Where are you going?

01:38:16.432 --> 01:38:17.975
I'm going to make a phone call.

01:38:24.399 --> 01:38:26.900
Hello, mayday, <i>Orca.</i>
Coast Guard?

01:38:28.236 --> 01:38:30.737
Coast Guard, this is the <i>Orca.</i>
Do you read me?

01:38:30.822 --> 01:38:33.323
Coast Guard, this is the <i>Orca.</i>
Do you...

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:40.956
Excuse me, Chief.

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:44.751
That's great!
That's just great!

01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:46.503
Now, where the hell are we, eh?

01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:51.675
You're certifiable, Quint, you know that?
You're certifiable!

01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:53.802
You're certifiable,
but I'll tell you this!

01:38:53.886 --> 01:38:55.178
Boys,

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:59.516
I think he's come back
for his noon feeding.

01:39:01.019 --> 01:39:02.811
Hook me up another barrel.

01:39:33.426 --> 01:39:35.260
Bring her around after him.

01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:54.571
Full throttle!
Get me right up alongside of him!

01:39:54.697 --> 01:39:57.949
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not going to take it!

01:40:15.677 --> 01:40:17.260
Five degrees port.

01:40:24.143 --> 01:40:26.103
All right, hold your course.

01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:34.361
Five degrees port now.

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:39.282
Hold your course.

01:40:40.952 --> 01:40:42.202
Fast fish.

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:43.453
Watch my hand.

01:40:44.664 --> 01:40:48.208
Be sure you watch my hand!
Follow me.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:52.045
Lad, you watch him now! Starboard!

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:55.132
Run him down, Hooper.

01:41:02.306 --> 01:41:03.640
Hard aport.

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:09.146
Watch him. Starboard.

01:41:33.963 --> 01:41:37.299
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:44.347
It's incredible.

01:41:50.396 --> 01:41:52.314
- They're up again!
- Now what?

01:42:01.574 --> 01:42:03.950
Why don't we lead the shark into shore

01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:05.827
instead of him leading us out to sea?

01:42:10.291 --> 01:42:12.000
Grab a couple of poles.

01:42:14.295 --> 01:42:16.421
Hang on now, we're going around.

01:42:17.215 --> 01:42:19.716
Into starboard. Easy.

01:42:20.676 --> 01:42:22.719
I'm going to back her off now.

01:42:22.804 --> 01:42:24.596
Watch those barrels, boys.
Watch them.

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:31.228
All right, gentlemen, snag them.

01:42:36.484 --> 01:42:38.860
Now then, tie them
to the stern cleats.

01:42:42.114 --> 01:42:44.741
Brody, bring your end
around the cleat.

01:42:45.785 --> 01:42:49.329
That's right, it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.

01:42:51.415 --> 01:42:53.124
Stay clear of the line!

01:43:00.883 --> 01:43:02.592
Watch it. Stand clear.

01:43:12.728 --> 01:43:15.230
Stand away from those stern cleats!

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:30.453
Back home we got a taxidermy man.

01:43:30.538 --> 01:43:31.997
He's going to have a heart attack

01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:33.549
when he sees what I brought him.

01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:43.466
Throttle back.
You're losing a cleat.

01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:48.847
My God, this one, too.
They're both going.

01:43:49.098 --> 01:43:51.016
He's eating his way
through that line.

01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.976
He's working his way
right up to us.

01:43:53.102 --> 01:43:55.937
Quint!
Come on, Quint. Hurry!

01:43:58.482 --> 01:43:59.774
Out of my way.

01:44:04.989 --> 01:44:05.989
Watch it.

01:44:10.036 --> 01:44:12.662
Untie this.
He'll pull out the transom.

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.460
Make it fast!
We got another line in him!

01:44:18.544 --> 01:44:20.503
I can't, it's trying to run!

01:44:21.881 --> 01:44:23.590
We better get another line!

01:44:23.674 --> 01:44:25.675
Pull, you son of a bitch!

01:44:25.968 --> 01:44:28.178
I hope your back breaks!

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:30.138
Go ahead.
Pull your bloody heart out.

01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:32.182
Tie him off!

01:44:37.355 --> 01:44:39.689
It's impossible!

01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:42.567
Boys, it's too tight!

01:44:43.027 --> 01:44:44.819
He's pulling us!

01:44:46.739 --> 01:44:48.657
We're breaking up over here!

01:44:55.247 --> 01:44:57.540
We're breaking up! Cut it!

01:44:58.376 --> 01:44:59.834
Watch your hands!

01:45:01.212 --> 01:45:03.254
Cut it quick.
I can't hold it!

01:45:24.402 --> 01:45:26.778
He can't stay down
with three barrels on him.

01:45:26.904 --> 01:45:29.072
Not with three barrels, he can't.

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:30.740
What about us?

01:45:31.283 --> 01:45:34.953
Hooper, get the pump out of the locker
in front of you, will you?

01:45:35.413 --> 01:45:37.163
We're going to sink, aren't we?

01:45:37.248 --> 01:45:40.208
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.

01:45:46.716 --> 01:45:48.258
Starting to go under.

01:45:48.426 --> 01:45:51.886
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.

01:46:26.756 --> 01:46:28.923
You ever have one do this before?

01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:32.260
No.

01:47:03.918 --> 01:47:06.628
He's chasing us.
I don't believe it.

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:14.260
I'm going to draw him
into the shallows.

01:47:14.345 --> 01:47:15.553
Draw him into the shallow water.

01:47:15.638 --> 01:47:18.431
I'm going to draw him in
and drown him.

01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:19.891
We're heading in, Brody.

01:47:19.975 --> 01:47:21.142
Thank Christ!

01:47:28.943 --> 01:47:30.026
You ever had a great white do that?

01:47:30.111 --> 01:47:31.444
No.

01:47:37.535 --> 01:47:39.619
How far do we have to go?

01:47:42.206 --> 01:47:44.791
Don't put that much pressure on it.

01:47:54.969 --> 01:47:56.052
God damn it.

01:47:56.137 --> 01:47:57.846
Shut up. Get back there.

01:48:03.561 --> 01:48:04.727
Hold on.

01:48:19.743 --> 01:48:24.998
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>

01:48:27.251 --> 01:48:32.088
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>

01:48:33.674 --> 01:48:38.845
<i>For we received order
for to sail back to Boston</i>

01:48:39.221 --> 01:48:41.598
You idiot, you burned out the bearings.

01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:46.728
All right, stop the boat. Stop it.

01:50:26.537 --> 01:50:29.914
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:37.839
I think I can pump 20 cc
of strychnine nitrate into him.

01:50:38.215 --> 01:50:40.425
If I can get close enough.

01:50:42.886 --> 01:50:45.388
Get this little needle
through his skin?

01:50:47.182 --> 01:50:48.766
No, I can't do that.

01:50:50.728 --> 01:50:52.645
If I can get him
close to the cage,

01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:53.896
I can get him in the mouth.

01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:55.523
That shark will rip
that cage to pieces.

01:50:55.607 --> 01:50:58.026
You got any better suggestions?

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:24.302
Easy.

01:51:26.889 --> 01:51:28.097
Up she goes.

01:51:29.475 --> 01:51:31.225
Ease her up.

01:52:23.112 --> 01:52:24.570
Ain't got no spit.

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.422
Try and keep him off me
until I'm lower.

01:52:45.175 --> 01:52:46.634
Okay, I'm ready.

01:55:43.312 --> 01:55:47.023
Bring him up, God damn it.
Bring him up now!

01:55:52.613 --> 01:55:54.363
Pull it up. Pull it.

01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:06.876
Pull him up.
Come on, Quint, bring him in.

01:56:10.172 --> 01:56:11.547
It's giving way!

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:25.519
Rig something!

01:56:28.523 --> 01:56:29.690
Got it?

01:56:33.904 --> 01:56:35.071
It's coming.

01:56:35.739 --> 01:56:37.365
Slow it down.

01:56:37.741 --> 01:56:39.033
Slower.

01:59:50.976 --> 01:59:53.686
All right, come on.

01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:55.312
Show me the tank.

02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:15.124
Blow up!

02:00:18.295 --> 02:00:20.087
Smile, you son of a bitch!

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:50.386
Quint?

02:01:51.721 --> 02:01:52.805
No.

02:02:02.065 --> 02:02:03.732
Can we get in on those?

02:02:10.407 --> 02:02:11.824
What day is this?

02:02:14.285 --> 02:02:16.662
It's Wednesday.
It's Tuesday, I think.

02:02:18.289 --> 02:02:20.416
I think the tide's with us.

02:02:21.001 --> 02:02:22.584
Keep kicking.

02:02:25.964 --> 02:02:28.090
I used to hate the water.

02:02:30.301 --> 02:02:32.136
I can't imagine why.
