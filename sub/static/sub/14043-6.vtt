WEBVTT

00:09.866 --> 00:12.466
A pack of coyotes
come right up the back porch
the other night,

00:12.500 --> 00:15.133
'cause your dog's in heat
and you know those
fuckin' yellow eyed bastards

00:15.166 --> 00:16.733
will go right through
the screen door
if they're horny.

00:16.766 --> 00:17.766
(COCKS GUN)

00:20.700 --> 00:23.666
Look like you're goin'
to a formal with that
top button done up to 11.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.500
Oh, it's not like I'm gonna
be one of those nut sacks,

00:25.533 --> 00:27.700
sitting around
getting sucked on
by skeeters all day.

00:27.733 --> 00:28.533
Come off it.

00:30.266 --> 00:32.166
Well. Pitter patter.
Let's get at 'er.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.533
Sixty bucks per
dead coyote ain't
gonna collect itselfs.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.066
I think I'll have
a bumper dump
before we get started.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.466
Oh, I don't give a care.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.100
You ever had a bumper dump?

00:41.133 --> 00:43.166
It's not polite
to talk about.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.433
Though I do gotta
piss goddamn bad.

00:45.466 --> 00:47.300
When you have a dump,

00:47.333 --> 00:48.600
leaning up against
the back of the bumper
of your machine.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.600
So, it's pretty near
like it sounds then.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.500
You ever have a stump hump?

00:52.533 --> 00:54.200
You know,
I think I did, but...

00:55.133 --> 00:56.433
I can't remember.

00:56.466 --> 00:57.566
It's when you have sex...
With a girl?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.033
Yeah, with a girl.

00:59.066 --> 01:02.333
Bent over a stump of a tree.

01:02.366 --> 01:06.266
My friend said he had sex
inside a hollowed log
one time and I thought,

01:06.300 --> 01:08.700
"Why, I bet Fred Penner
pulled that off
one time, too."

01:15.533 --> 01:17.066
This right here,
perfect stump
for a stump hump.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.200
I should say.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.533
Wayne?
Dary.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.066
Come over here and
join me for a sec.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.233
Oh, well fuckin'...

01:28.133 --> 01:29.466
Like fuckin' why?

01:31.366 --> 01:35.333
It appears somebody's
been growing marijuana
in your back bush.

01:35.366 --> 01:37.366
You left the barn door open
after chores one time

01:37.400 --> 01:39.200
and your dad thought
you were stoned.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.233
But you haven't smoked
the electric lettuce
since grade eight.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.700
That's a mitt full
of Johnny Red Eye,
all right.

01:52.733 --> 01:54.700
I think it's only appropriate
we call the cops.

01:54.733 --> 01:58.133
Just take about 20% off 'er
over there, mixed berry.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.566
Don't be such a sally.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.800
You know how much shit
needs doin' around here?

02:00.833 --> 02:02.500
Well, shit needs
so much doin' really...

02:02.533 --> 02:04.633
The produce stand
is a fuckin' shanty.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.633
If we sell this stuff,
we can make thousands.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.366
I know a guy
on the reserve.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.166
I don't know.
Why not?

02:10.200 --> 02:12.633
It's 'cause...
Just kidding.
We don't give a fuck.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.133
KATY: If the cops come
around here, people will talk.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.333
Don't want people talkin'.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.133
Call your guy.
(SMIRKS)

02:24.200 --> 02:25.500
STEWART: Hello, Tanis.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.300
TANIS: You know the deal.
Personal use only.

02:30.333 --> 02:31.600
If I hear about yous
turning around
and selling them,

02:31.633 --> 02:33.000
and I will hear about it,

02:34.433 --> 02:35.666
we're gonna have
a hell of a problem.

02:37.433 --> 02:38.466
TANIS: Here's your smokes.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.333
Dime a dart.

02:44.100 --> 02:44.733
Dime a dart.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.066
Buck a dart.
Buck a dart.

02:50.466 --> 02:52.100
They're fuckin' ya.
Buck a dart.

02:52.133 --> 02:52.733
Buck a dart.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.733
They're fuckin' us.

03:04.566 --> 03:06.600
I've got some photos here.
Of the goins' on.

03:09.166 --> 03:10.333
(SIGHS)

03:13.233 --> 03:16.266
You gonna be upset
if you keep scrolling
to the left, dog.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.100
You gonna see some shit
that you don't wanna see.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.066
This is a big crop.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.300
Whoever planted it,

03:25.333 --> 03:28.466
has done a lot
of sneaking around
and maintaining it so well.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.266
We're busy enough
keeping the worm pickers
off the property.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.733
There's nothing like
good outdoor grown.

03:37.766 --> 03:40.566
It's 5k worth
and ready for harvesting.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.733
You pull it out
of the ground,

03:43.100 --> 03:44.233
I'll pick it up.

03:44.733 --> 03:45.733
Cash deal.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.000
Deal.

03:59.566 --> 04:00.600
Who is this?

04:00.633 --> 04:03.066
WALLY: That's Tanis,
my daughter.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.233
Should say estranged,
I suppose.

04:05.266 --> 04:06.333
What's so stranged
about her?

04:06.366 --> 04:09.700
I'll tell you,
if you find
yourselves in her way,

04:09.733 --> 04:11.166
you oughtta
swiftly get out of it.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.066
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

04:13.100 --> 04:14.166
Give me a minute.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.300
So, how about it, boys?

04:18.333 --> 04:19.766
Can always count on
old Katy‐Kat.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.100
You delivered.
I'll give you that.

04:23.133 --> 04:26.166
But what type of prick
doesn't stand up and
shake another man's hand?

04:27.666 --> 04:29.033
About Tanis...

04:29.533 --> 04:30.600
What about her?

04:32.600 --> 04:34.266
I think I'm sweet on her.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.600
Yeah? What for, Dary?

04:37.133 --> 04:40.333
What for...
Dary, you don't
need to explain.

04:40.366 --> 04:42.100
She makes
your dick hard,
get after it.

04:42.133 --> 04:43.466
We'll worry
about that later.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.700
Work on the produce stand
starts today.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.566
Still waiting
for you to say...
Thank you.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.500
For being a d‐jen
with a drug dealer.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.100
Now, if you ever hit me
and I find out about it...

05:03.533 --> 05:05.466
(GAGS)
COACH: That's good, Jonesy.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.433
No more kids table
with the big boy moves
like that, huh?

05:08.466 --> 05:10.733
You guys ready to play
like big boys yet, huh?

05:10.766 --> 05:13.066
Maybe pick out
your own outfits
in the morning?

05:13.100 --> 05:15.033
Make your own snacks?

05:15.066 --> 05:18.066
Some solo
back to school shopping?

05:18.766 --> 05:21.166
It's fuckin' embarrassing!

05:22.400 --> 05:23.733
Good news is,

05:23.766 --> 05:26.133
Pee Wee secondary team
just canceled their ice time.

05:26.166 --> 05:28.633
I think we can make
good use of it, huh?

05:28.666 --> 05:30.333
Suit up, pheasants.

05:30.366 --> 05:32.500

the fun stuff on deck.

06:15.566 --> 06:18.600
We don't know any
dusters that do meth
and now the fuckin' rookie?

06:18.633 --> 06:20.766
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

06:20.800 --> 06:25.266

Stewart and Devon
and all those skids.

But that's it, buddy.

06:28.133 --> 06:31.600
You know, I heard
that Ginger and Boots
used to do that shit.

06:31.633 --> 06:34.366
And look where
it got them, schmelt!

06:34.400 --> 06:37.700
My buddy Royze had a bad
stint for a while, now that
I think about it, buddy.

06:37.733 --> 06:41.033
But that's cause Royze was
hangin' out with Tolzy and
that guy's a fuckin' pigeon.

06:41.066 --> 06:43.700
My buddy Parkzy too.
I guess Belzy was
fucked up for a while.

06:43.733 --> 06:45.066
And he got Welzy into it.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.466
Yeah, Belzy and Welzy
were doing it with Carzy
and his billet sister.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.766
Carzy and his billet sister
got Colzy fucked up once.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.733
Wait, isn't Colzy
still fucked up, bro?

06:52.766 --> 06:54.300
Only when he's with
Kitzy and Burzy, bro.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.466
Colzy is always with
Kitzy and Burzy.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.400
Well, Colzy, Kitzy and Burzy
are always with Carzy
and his billet sister, buddy.

06:59.433 --> 07:01.633
Who are always with
Belzy and Welzy.

07:02.766 --> 07:04.600

see the skids.

07:09.666 --> 07:11.733
We're gonna go.
We're gonna do it?

07:11.766 --> 07:13.400
Do you wanna do it?
You want one?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.666
Let's do it!
Give me one!

07:14.700 --> 07:16.066
We're gonna have one.
Give me it.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.166
We're going.
Let's go then!

07:17.200 --> 07:18.166
Let's go!

07:21.166 --> 07:22.466

This is where
I ruin your life.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.166
Hang on...
No, no, no.
You hang on. All right?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.300
Yous ripped me off.
And I'm fuckin' pissed.

07:39.666 --> 07:42.133
But... (SIGHS)

07:42.166 --> 07:45.033
We can make it right.
As un‐PC as this
market may be,

07:45.066 --> 07:47.200
it's pretty lucrative, so...

07:47.233 --> 07:49.600
If you sell the rest
of the cigarettes
at a buck a dart,

07:49.633 --> 07:51.166
we get ninety cents,
you get ten.

No! No deal.

money at that rave.

toes in any business venture.
It's inevitable.

If we want to take
this meth business
to the next level,

08:04.100 --> 08:06.133
we cannot part with
any more coin.

Are you with me?
Always.

you think this works?

and then we're square?

coming together nicely.

up his place, bro.

10:52.533 --> 10:55.033
Fuckin' long hair
don't care, bro.

10:55.066 --> 10:57.566
We find the skids
and have that fuckin'
donnybrook, buddy.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.233
Buckets off?
Fuckin' rip over there
and just conflict.

11:00.266 --> 11:01.600
Fight. Injure. Kill.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.433
Ball up and bang out, bud.

11:03.466 --> 11:05.200

Sorry about what
happened here.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.000
Know about the beef?

12:08.400 --> 12:10.200
What beef?

12:10.233 --> 12:11.666
Between your meth pals
and my daughter.

12:11.700 --> 12:13.400
Two things. One,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.733
no one who does meth
is a pal of mine
for fuck's sake.

12:15.766 --> 12:18.200
Two, what are
you talking about?

12:18.233 --> 12:21.266
She was ripped off on
a cigarette transaction by
some fellas from Letterkenny.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.300
(SNIFFS)

12:25.600 --> 12:27.500
And then?

12:27.533 --> 12:29.633
She's owed money
by someone
from your town.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.633
She's gonna make it
everyone's problem.

12:31.666 --> 12:33.466
I'm sorry to be
the bearer of bad news.

12:38.433 --> 12:40.566
Hope this serves as
some sort of consolation.

12:42.733 --> 12:45.366
Count it if you like.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.333
She won't stop until
she gets what's owed.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.600
When Tanis comes
back to collect,
she won't be short staffed.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.300

Predictable!

13:08.766 --> 13:10.566
Is this little soiree for us?

13:10.600 --> 13:13.033
And you missed to a better
one at the Ag Hall
last weekend.

13:13.066 --> 13:15.633
You should have come.
You gave the rookie
meth, idiot.

13:15.666 --> 13:17.400
First one's free.

13:17.433 --> 13:19.766
You fuckin' turned
Letterkenny into a war zone.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.033
Got us labeled as
a meth town, idiot.

13:22.066 --> 13:23.533
So, what are you
gonna do about it?
Idiot.

13:23.566 --> 13:25.500
Buckets off.
Fuckin' go time.

13:25.533 --> 13:26.666
Shed 'em.
Go me!

A little fuck me, fuck you?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.133
MAN 1: Free fuckin' nose jobs?

13:30.166 --> 13:31.366
MAN 2: Let's dance.
MAN 1: Hit the d‐floor.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.400
TANIS: My balls dangle
harder than you.

13:33.433 --> 13:34.433
Yeah, sounds familiar.

13:34.466 --> 13:36.033
(WHISPERING) This is what
we've been waiting for.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.266
Hey!
It's time.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.400
You got our money?
Nay!

13:39.433 --> 13:42.600
We do not have,
nor will we ever have,
a dime for you.

13:42.633 --> 13:46.400
And you took away our only
source of income when
you trashed our meth lab!

13:46.433 --> 13:49.100
(ALL LAUGH)
We're all here. So, uh...

13:49.133 --> 13:51.066
It's combat,
let's proceed.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.266
Power stop, Tanis.
We got dibs on the
donnybrook with the skids.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.366
What's a dibs?

13:55.400 --> 13:56.700
A dibs is a dibs is a dibs.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.566
Hey! Pipe down, shit head.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.066
You don't get it, do you?

14:01.100 --> 14:02.566
This is about the money.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.860
So, until we get the money,
Letterkenny will
continue to burn.

14:06.893 --> 14:08.027
All right?

14:10.460 --> 14:11.527
How are you now?

14:11.560 --> 14:12.960
Good, and you?

14:14.627 --> 14:15.827
Deadly.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.393
Is that...

14:23.427 --> 14:26.127
The Ginger and Boots.

14:29.127 --> 14:30.860
(WHISPERS) Those two guys
fucked an ostrich.

14:32.060 --> 14:34.293
Just the Ginger
fucked an ostrich.

14:34.327 --> 14:35.760
Allegedly.

14:35.793 --> 14:38.960
Mmm‐mmm. It would take
like two people to fuck
an ostrich. Three even...

14:38.993 --> 14:40.260
It was a sick ostrich.

14:40.293 --> 14:42.093
Allegedly.

14:42.127 --> 14:44.627
You're fucking ruthless
for bringing a couple dudes
like that here.

(WHISPERS) In his defense...
He's usually not
the type of prick I am.

14:47.327 --> 14:49.893
If they fucked an ostrich,
what else have they fucked?

14:49.927 --> 14:51.593
Just the Ginger
fucked an ostrich.

14:51.627 --> 14:52.960
Allegedly.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.427
I ask again.
If they fucked an ostrich,

14:55.460 --> 14:57.060
what else have they fucked?

14:57.093 --> 14:58.860
It's almost not worth
thinkin' about.

And it's none of my business.

outta yous right here.

one day, we'll get ya.

15:19.093 --> 15:21.260

friends call me sometimes.

you're doing around
Letterkenny to bed.

That's 5k. What are
you's owed?

15:38.427 --> 15:39.993
(SCOFFS) More than that.

15:40.027 --> 15:42.027
We're tough fuckin' sleddin'!
Hey.

15:44.427 --> 15:46.293
We're gonna call it 5k.

15:46.327 --> 15:48.093
Is that what we're gonna do?
We are.

15:48.127 --> 15:50.193
You're gonna take it
and leave Letterkenny.

15:50.227 --> 15:52.527

so much as to pump your gas...

you popped out,

a sewn up snapper.

better if you grew to a
