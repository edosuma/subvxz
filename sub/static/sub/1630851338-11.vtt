00:02.069 --> 00:06.638
â™ª â™ª

00:47.415 --> 00:49.081
Margaret:
She didn't even know him.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.550
Yet he bequeathed
her his entire estate.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.751
It's worth millions.

00:53.788 --> 00:56.555
Ruth:
Three and a half million.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.291
My understanding is that
dr. Ogden saved his life

00:59.360 --> 01:00.559
On the operating table.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.228
Yes, but he died,
didn't he?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.631
No heirs
and a ten-room mansion.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.300
Julia suggested turning
it into an orphanage

01:08.302 --> 01:11.103
And using the remaining
estate to maintain it.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.304
So, he left it
to you instead?

01:13.340 --> 01:15.507
Yes, he left it in
my capable hands

01:15.642 --> 01:18.443
To see that his
wishes be fulfilled.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.112
You ever been to
the maitland estate?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.446
No.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.515
I'd never even heard
of the man in fact.

01:23.650 --> 01:26.051
Some sort of toymaker,
I understand?

01:26.120 --> 01:27.719
He was the toy king!

01:27.721 --> 01:30.656
When I was a lad, he'd throw
a christmas party every year.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.591
Invite all
the kids from town.

01:32.593 --> 01:36.328
Toys everywhere.
The whole house is a toy.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.664
At least it was
before little annie died.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.132
Little annie?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.603
His daughter.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.471
Sweetest little thing.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.708
Died christmas day;
scarlet fever.

01:49.843 --> 01:54.146
The following year,
on christmas, his wife left him,

01:54.148 --> 01:57.148
Went back to new york
with her kids.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.284
No one's seen
him since them.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.087
Spent the 20 last years being
a hermit in this big old house.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.291
- Effie, look at this.
- Beautiful house.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.694
Oh, george, look,
it's beautiful.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.094
Whoa.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.101
Was it in mr. Maitland's will
that we spend christmas here?

02:16.236 --> 02:18.770
Actually, it was the
servants who invited us.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.173
I believe it's their
way of saying thank you

02:21.175 --> 02:22.374
For being kept on.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.910
[baby cries]

02:24.979 --> 02:26.578
They may regret
that decision.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.951
Welcome!
Dr. Ogden, I presume?

02:32.953 --> 02:34.118
Mr. Burnside!

02:34.155 --> 02:36.388
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.389
Mm.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.259
May I introduce
our maid and cook?

02:40.394 --> 02:42.594
Ah, mary farn?

02:42.630 --> 02:44.529
And gwen luff.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.131
Very good, ma'am.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.735
Over here!
Should be fine for now.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.670
Bloody hell, higgins.
We're only here for two nights.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.739
These are all for
ruth's tableau, sir.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.207
A what?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.875
I don't fully
understand myself, sir.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.879
There are no
christmas decorations.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.015
Well, that's not
surprising, I suppose,

03:03.150 --> 03:05.150
Given the history
of the place.

03:08.488 --> 03:10.222
Look at this place!

03:10.291 --> 03:11.623
Yes.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.226
It's a shame to be wasting
it on those orphans.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.427
Of course.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.494
Oh, no, no.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.896
That's to be put with
the others, right there.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.568
We've never had
servants before.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.237
Well, don't let it
go to your head.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.675
Ogden:
It really is magnificent.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.645
You could always keep
it for yourself.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.315
It may be christmas,

03:37.351 --> 03:40.785
But I have no intention
of being ebenezer scrooge.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.738
How lovely.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.747
Ah, here we are!

04:08.749 --> 04:11.950
Dr. Julia ogden
and husband.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.818
[laughs]

04:23.030 --> 04:24.162
And you're here.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.898
Oh! Yes, I can see that.
Thank you.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.499
Is there anything
else you need?

04:28.535 --> 04:30.101
Oh, yes. Yes!

04:30.137 --> 04:31.436
Oh, where do
I even begin?

04:31.438 --> 04:32.704
Come in! Come in,
come in, come in.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.410
-Here we are.
-Thank you.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.114
Margaret:
Oh, look at this room!

04:47.721 --> 04:49.855
I wonder which one
our room is then?

04:49.857 --> 04:51.255
Well, it must be
this one here.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.799
Good gracious!

05:05.639 --> 05:07.739
Could you imagine growing up
in a room like this?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.808
My parents didn't go in
for this kind of thing.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.677
What?
You didn't play with toys?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.145
I had an abacus.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.282
[chimes]

05:17.284 --> 05:19.484
[throat clearing]

05:19.520 --> 05:21.820
I'm sorry, sir.
This room is not for occupation.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.755
Yours is across the hall.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.289
Yes, of course.

05:25.326 --> 05:28.427
Um...
Was this annie's room?

05:28.562 --> 05:30.195
It was, sir.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.497
Mr. Maitland wanted it
left as she had it.

05:32.632 --> 05:36.268
Miss newsome,
I will escort you to your room.

05:36.270 --> 05:37.703
Oh, that won't
be necessary.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.639
Constable crabtree
and I have recently wed.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.574
I see.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.509
Very good, then.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.148
Effie?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.418
It is christmas,
george.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.391
Henry and I have a project
that demands our attention,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.793
So if you could
avail yourself as a nanny

06:01.862 --> 06:03.195
That would be wonderful.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.996
Oh, I'm not much
good with babies.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.798
Oh, well, jordan will
be no problem for you.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.667
She loves everybody.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.268
Oh, look!
She's waking up.

06:10.337 --> 06:13.405
Hello, my darling, hello.

06:13.474 --> 06:17.542
[baby crying]

06:17.611 --> 06:19.878
Oh, well, uh...

06:20.013 --> 06:22.347
This is an orphanage now,
so best get used to it.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.418
Shh, shh, shh...

06:26.553 --> 06:27.953
[grunting efforts]

06:32.426 --> 06:34.159
Oh!

06:34.161 --> 06:37.562
What would
baby jesus wear, hm?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.831
Uh, this is just for
the tableau, right?

06:39.966 --> 06:42.233
Well, I don't plan
on dressing her

06:42.269 --> 06:43.902
As jesus on
a regular basis.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.236
Oh.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.407
Ruth:
Hello, my little one.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.912
William, are these
christmas tree lights?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.713
I know what
you're thinking!

06:55.783 --> 06:57.048
Last time you
took out the power

06:57.117 --> 06:58.450
In the entire building.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.385
Yes, but I've solved
that problem.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.053
You better have.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.024
Now, this is for you.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.060
But we open gifts
christmas morning.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.063
Yes, but this is your
christmas gift from last year.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.331
Remember?

07:13.333 --> 07:15.467
I gave you a card that said
your present was coming.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.002
Well, this is it.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.636
A whole year later.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.673
No!
364 days later.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.675
I had to get it
specially made

07:23.744 --> 07:26.278
And it took a little
longer than anticipated.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.280
It's a pair of glasses

07:28.415 --> 07:30.748
With two different
magnifying lenses,

07:30.750 --> 07:32.484
Just like the one
that you saw in...

07:32.553 --> 07:34.585
In new york! Yes!

07:36.423 --> 07:40.091
[laughs]
wonderful!

07:40.160 --> 07:41.626
Thank you.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.295
Ha!

07:44.331 --> 07:45.497
Well...

07:50.504 --> 07:52.436
This must be for me.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.372
Yes.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.144
But you don't get to
open it until tomorrow.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.454
Ogden:
Fine.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.061
Burnside:
Christmas decorations?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.729
We're happy to
make our own,

08:17.798 --> 08:19.130
But if there are
any here already?

08:19.132 --> 08:20.565
Well, I don't know.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.199
Mr. Maitland didn't
celebrate christmas.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.936
It was a rather hard
time of year for him.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.239
Are you looking
for decorations?

08:27.374 --> 08:29.007
Ah, we are. Yes.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.375
There's a box
in the basement.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.609
Oh!

08:31.645 --> 08:33.478
Very good!
Have at it, then.

08:33.480 --> 08:37.014
It will be nice to have a bit
of christmas around the house.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.885
All right, then.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.422
You're from
the old country.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.825
I am, sir, although
I have been here a while.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.926
I can't quite
place your accent.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.161
Would you like me
to tell you, sir,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.096
Or would you
prefer to guess?

08:52.132 --> 08:53.565
Devon.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.532
Sorry, sir.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.433
Mm.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.302
-Sir?
-Dear god!

08:57.304 --> 08:59.838
Shall we procure
a christmas tree?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.372
Why not?

09:01.408 --> 09:03.441
A tree!
Yes, of course.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.976
I'll get it.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.510
Very good, sir.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.416
Hart:
Where is everyone?

09:12.452 --> 09:16.120
By everyone I assume you mean
those that are not me.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.255
I can see
where you are.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.792
They've all decamped to
a small town north of here.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.793
Ah, yes.
The maitland estate.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.329
You didn't go?

09:24.331 --> 09:26.398
Oh, someone has to man
the station over christmas,

09:26.400 --> 09:27.799
Might as well be me.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.402
Hm. You hate christmas?

09:30.537 --> 09:33.338
I'm jewish by birth,
a doubter by nature

09:33.407 --> 09:35.139
And a cynic
by experience.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.808
But, more than all that,
I find myself incapable

09:37.844 --> 09:39.677
Of forced cheer.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.147
Amen to that.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.059
As you may know, mr. Maitland
used to be a toymaker.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.901
Effie:
Oh, george, look.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.835
I've always wanted
one of these.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.642
The decorations
are right here.

10:13.580 --> 10:14.846
They're a tad dusty.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.781
Oh, that's fine!
We'll dust them off.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.985
It'll be lovely to see
them up after so much time.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.987
Would it be possible to bring
the dollhouse upstairs?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.424
Of course.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.528
-Ma'am.
-Thank you so much.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.930
Oh.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.865
Oh, I can make another bowl,
if you'd like.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.135
No. No-no.
It's all right.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.470
I'm a chef.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.605
I'm not used to being called
on to make popped corn.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.175
No, this will
do splendidly.

10:45.745 --> 10:48.379
I just. I feel I have to be
a little bit more reclined.

10:48.382 --> 10:49.814
Like this.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.483
I've just given birth
to the son of god.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.885
I'm exhausted.

10:59.960 --> 11:00.825
[baby cries]

11:00.960 --> 11:02.827
Oh!

11:02.962 --> 11:04.629
Must need her
nappy changed.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.997
Yoo-hoo! Luff!

11:11.038 --> 11:12.770
So, this is
the kitchen.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.372
-Yes, ma'am.
-It's so big.

11:15.409 --> 11:18.576
And look at your stove!

11:18.645 --> 11:20.845
Is that a hoffman?

11:20.980 --> 11:23.515
I have always
wanted a hoffman.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.651
Oh! Sugarplums!

11:26.720 --> 11:28.453
Very christmasy.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.723
And I see we're
having duck for dinner.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.291
Not quite plucked!

11:34.327 --> 11:35.827
Can I help you,
ma'am?

11:35.829 --> 11:36.895
No.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.730
Uh, I just thought
that perhaps...

11:38.865 --> 11:39.864
I'm sorry.
I need to concentrate.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.732
If you need anything,
please use the bell.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.134
Of course.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.269
I... Yes.
All right.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.209
All right.

11:53.647 --> 11:56.414
Ah, sirs?

11:56.416 --> 11:57.882
I know.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.617
We're going to need
a bigger bucket.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.430
Oh, my.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.767
Crabtree:
That must be mr. Maitland.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.870
Effie:
Oh. Well, there's mrs. Maitland.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.308
Oh, george, look!

12:24.344 --> 12:26.110
These must be
his stepchildren.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.184
Crabtree: Effie,
that must be little annie.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.821
[chimes]

12:39.726 --> 12:41.025
Someone's in
annie's room.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.851
I don't have
anything for you.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.319
It's for
the both of us.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.822
Kentucky's finest!

13:11.858 --> 13:13.958
Aged 24 years.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.694
This is worth
a month's salary.

13:16.696 --> 13:17.995
For some, I suppose.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.097
But not you?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.332
I work for personal
fulfillment.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.834
I accept
your largesse.

13:30.677 --> 13:31.776
All right.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.583
Cheers.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.257
Hello?
What brings you three here?

13:46.392 --> 13:47.725
Are you a policeman?

13:47.861 --> 13:48.926
I am.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.063
Ah, well.
Thank you.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.799
It's not for you!

13:54.801 --> 13:56.667
We found it lying
on the street.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.336
Hmm.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.304
Let's see.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.108
Oh!

14:04.110 --> 14:05.542
Oh, my goodness!

14:05.579 --> 14:06.944
Maureen:
We need to find the owner.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.688
Julia.
Have you been peeking?

14:16.823 --> 14:18.956
Of course not!

14:18.992 --> 14:21.959
Although it has
been driving me mad.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.429
Someone's
opened the box.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.631
Maybe one
of the servants?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.565
Perhaps margaret.

14:28.602 --> 14:30.435
She is a bit nosy.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.937
Can't you give me
just a clue?

14:35.842 --> 14:37.308
Right.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.311
It's a night
in the galapagos

14:40.446 --> 14:42.179
Without leaving
your bed.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.052
It rattles.
How curious.

14:48.187 --> 14:50.121
Don't shake it too much

14:50.256 --> 14:53.257
And leave it right
here on the table

14:53.293 --> 14:55.393
Until tomorrow morning.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.929
Well, morning
starts at midnight.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.597
Not if I can help it.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.759
Watts: I never saw you
as the puppy type.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.360
I love puppies.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.295
It's people
I'm lukewarm on.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.899
To pj,
love mother and father.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.501
Look, we're not going
to be able to find

15:37.537 --> 15:39.103
The owner on
christmas eve.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.905
But it's
a christmas present!

15:41.040 --> 15:43.174
Pj is going to be
very disappointed.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.243
Well, put up posters
on boxing day.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.444
Take the puppy
home for now.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.180
We don't have a home.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.482
We're orphans.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.518
Never mind.
We'll just go door-to-door.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.987
Let's go.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.888
Wait.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.591
So, you're going
to help us?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.727
Well, he is
a detective.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.262
Let's see if
he's any good.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.462
Ha!

16:11.438 --> 16:12.637
I know you don't
believe in ghosts,

16:12.772 --> 16:14.138
But then how do you explain
the noises we heard

16:14.140 --> 16:15.139
From annie's room?

16:15.175 --> 16:16.607
I'm a lawyer, george.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.009
I don't require
an explanation.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.877
I just need
reasonable doubt.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.349
Well, here's
your ghost.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.951
I think that's annie.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.223
Ogden: William, all I know
is that it rattles

16:32.358 --> 16:34.091
When I shake it.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.360
Would you like
another clue?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.229
Yes! I'd like another clue.

16:38.364 --> 16:41.231
And make it a riddle,
a little rattle riddle.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.838
I make a sound
if I am round,

16:46.973 --> 16:50.641
But not if I've been
in the ground.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.978
[sighs]

16:55.015 --> 16:57.181
For goodness' sake!

16:57.183 --> 16:58.583
Thank you, mr. Burnside.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.252
Ah, just burnside
will suffice, sir.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.920
Cumbria.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.655
Sorry, sir.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.123
Huh.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.531
I've got nothing to do.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.134
Good. Just relax.
Enjoy it.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.470
I can't.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.206
I think, perhaps,

17:22.208 --> 17:24.809
I'm not cut out for
the high life after all.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.544
All right!

17:26.679 --> 17:28.679
Everyone, it's time to get
ready for the tableau.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.949
What is this bloody
tableau thing she's on about?

17:32.018 --> 17:34.819
Oh, she wants to photograph
us all in a manger scene.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.353
Where's the manger?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.356
Just go along.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.357
I will be seated
here on the chaise

17:40.393 --> 17:41.626
With the baby jesus.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.462
Joseph will be standing
next to me here.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.098
Gentlemen of the constabulary,
you'll be the three wise men.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.933
Ah! I'm good with that.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.902
Ah, the rest of you will
be a shepherd, sheep.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.503
I believe
we have an ox.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.639
-Oh, servants, too!
-Oh, there's no way!

17:54.641 --> 17:56.474
-Julia, I...
-Come, come. Come, come, come!

17:56.476 --> 17:57.742
Quickly.

17:57.877 --> 17:58.976
Oh!

17:59.045 --> 18:00.811
And we need someone
to take the photo.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.513
I'll do that.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.315
Ah.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.819
Oh, henry! The gifts.
The gifts, the gifts.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.456
Yes. Uh...
Sir, the gold.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.860
And, uh, frankincense
and myrrh.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.895
I don't know
which is which.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.230
Detective murdoch!

18:19.232 --> 18:22.133
Yes, yes. I just need
to connect the lights.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.101
Ruth:
All right.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.469
Murdoch:
And...

18:28.675 --> 18:31.408
Ogden:
William! Not again!

18:31.444 --> 18:32.776
Oh, dear.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.880
Looking for clues, detective?

18:35.949 --> 18:38.615
Mrs. Hart,
I detect mockery.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.284
And I will take it
as a challenge.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.752
So...

18:41.788 --> 18:45.022
You found this
package where exactly?

18:47.894 --> 18:49.560
-Queen street.
-Very good.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.629
And on which side
of the street?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.164
East.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.265
There's no east side
of queen street, silly.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.034
It was the south side.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.502
Well, if it was
the south side,

18:58.571 --> 19:01.038
We can suppose it fell
from a vehicle heading east.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.508
So, let's assume
somewhere east

19:04.511 --> 19:07.612
Of this point

19:07.747 --> 19:10.781
Is a child by
the name of pj.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.984
Now, what do p
and j stand for?

19:14.020 --> 19:16.053
Christian first
and middle name.

19:16.122 --> 19:20.123
Like paul james
macarthur?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.092
I once knew a pj.

19:22.128 --> 19:25.730
I also knew
an rj and an aj.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.199
Can you guess what
the j stood for?

19:28.201 --> 19:29.666
-John.
-Jacob.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.468
Jingleheimer schmidt!

19:31.470 --> 19:33.037
All good guesses.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.672
But in each case
the j stood for junior.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.474
Now, if that's the case,
the father's name

19:37.510 --> 19:39.476
Likely starts with a p.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.746
This is our station's
local directory.

19:41.748 --> 19:45.282
Your job is to circle
each first name

19:45.351 --> 19:47.151
That starts with a p.

19:47.286 --> 19:50.954
Your job is to note

19:50.990 --> 19:52.623
Which of those names

19:52.659 --> 19:55.359
Have addresses
east of parliament.

19:55.494 --> 19:59.096
You will put pins
where those addresses

19:59.165 --> 20:00.631
Are on the map.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.634
And I will enjoy some
of your fine bourbon.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.604
It has nothing to do

20:06.606 --> 20:07.772
With the christmas
tree lights, george.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.039
The power went out!

20:09.108 --> 20:10.241
If you say so, sir.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.543
They're connected
to a battery!

20:12.612 --> 20:14.912
Can we please
take the picture?

20:14.914 --> 20:16.914
Everyone!
Assume your positions!

20:17.049 --> 20:19.182
On the count of three. Ready?

20:19.219 --> 20:21.685
One. Two...

20:29.195 --> 20:32.730
[all murmur happily]

20:37.537 --> 20:39.136
William,
that was so odd.

20:39.172 --> 20:40.337
I had the strangest feeling

20:40.406 --> 20:42.172
That there was someone
right behind me.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.609
Gave me a chill.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.411
Listen, I know you
two don't believe

20:47.480 --> 20:49.280
In the spirit world, but...

20:49.415 --> 20:51.749
Well, sir, I suppose you
believe in a disembodied soul.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.952
George, we are not
being haunted by your ghost.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.221
No, but I do think
there's something

20:57.290 --> 20:58.956
Very odd about this house.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.290
Indeed.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.029
I would like four copies
of those, please.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.630
They're to be your
christmas presents.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.631
Oh.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.501
You do develop photographs,
do you not?

21:10.503 --> 21:11.835
Well, yes, of course,

21:11.904 --> 21:13.504
But I haven't brought
the supplies with me.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.973
Oh! That's all right.
I've brought them with me.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.041
Thank you.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.179
Is everything all right?

21:22.181 --> 21:23.648
I've never cooked
for so many people.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.649
Well, are the ducks
in the oven?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.551
They went
in at, uh, six?

21:27.620 --> 21:28.986
Did you baste them?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.688
No. No, no.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.123
It's all right.
Ah, dear.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.124
Um... Oh!
Ha-ha.

21:36.229 --> 21:40.197
Let me tell you: I have
cooked for twelve people

21:40.199 --> 21:42.933
And it is all
in the timing.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.903
Oh! Thank goodness.

21:45.905 --> 21:49.272
Now, just do
everything I tell you.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.207
Mmm-hmm.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.012
Ogden: Oh, my.
Look at this. What a spread!

21:56.049 --> 21:57.948
They even have
christmas crackers.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.484
Does that mean we have to wear
those silly, bloody paper hats?

22:00.619 --> 22:02.586
I'm afraid so,
inspector.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.290
Ooh! Roast duck!

22:06.292 --> 22:07.758
I'll wear a paper
hat for that.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.294
You have me
to thank for that.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.096
-You?
-I helped out.

22:12.231 --> 22:15.265
It's a good thing, too.
She's a terrible cook.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.368
Shall we say grace?

22:18.404 --> 22:20.571
No, no, no, no, no!
Crackers first.

22:20.706 --> 22:21.938
Everyone!

22:23.175 --> 22:24.241
- Here you go, ruthie.
- All right, then, margaret.

22:24.277 --> 22:25.709
You grab that.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.044
Thomas, one, two, three.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.313
Shall we?

22:29.315 --> 22:30.347
Ah!

22:30.416 --> 22:31.915
Oh!

22:36.022 --> 22:37.320
A bit too much
powder in that one.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.956
I don't even know
where the prize went.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.326
Likely in the next room,
by the sound of it.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.739
[rattling]

22:55.742 --> 22:57.541
It rattles
after I shake it.

22:57.577 --> 22:58.609
Why?

22:58.611 --> 23:00.410
Julia!

23:01.680 --> 23:04.014
The temptation
is too great!

23:04.083 --> 23:07.017
Oh, go ahead
and open it.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.785
It doesn't
really matter.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.289
No! I'm not going to.

23:12.325 --> 23:14.291
I'm not going to think about it
until tomorrow morning.

23:17.263 --> 23:18.829
And look,
it's for you.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.966
Ooh! Sugar plums.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.167
Delicious!

23:24.203 --> 23:26.437
I couldn't possibly
after that meal.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.705
Mm.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.241
Look!

23:31.310 --> 23:33.511
'twas the night before christmas
and all through the house,

23:33.513 --> 23:38.048
Not a creature was stirring
except for a mouse.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.517
I'm going to give
my sugar plum to him.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.552
Oh, julia. We shouldn't.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.055
Julia:
It's christmas for mice, too.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.464
I see. Thank you.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.999
Merry christmas to you.

23:56.402 --> 23:58.936
That was the last of those
that have telephones.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.338
For the rest we'll
have to go knocking.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.008
Well, don't just
stand there.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.510
Coats on.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.355
[coughs]

24:25.164 --> 24:27.030
Oh! Julia!

24:29.769 --> 24:30.968
What's happening?

24:31.037 --> 24:32.703
William, smoke!

24:35.574 --> 24:37.173
Did you close
the damper?

24:37.210 --> 24:39.309
It should be open.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.382
Ah!

24:49.188 --> 24:52.188
Someone put this inside
to block the flue.

24:52.225 --> 24:54.458
That has to be
deliberate.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.660
Is someone trying
to kill us?

25:02.335 --> 25:04.201
I assumed you were
from the same family.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.669
Charlie is
tammy's brother.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.137
I met them at
sacred heart.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.406
Oh. Is that
where you are now?

25:09.442 --> 25:12.075
He doesn't
have to know.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.612
Charlie and tammy
were going to be split up

25:14.747 --> 25:16.013
So they ran away.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.548
I went with them.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.683
So, you're living
on the streets?

25:19.685 --> 25:21.618
Where do you sleep?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.287
Sheds or porches,
mostly.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.156
This time of year, they'll
sometimes let you sleep inside.

25:26.158 --> 25:29.026
All right.
Last door.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.360
Cross fingers.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.533
Merry christmas.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.034
Are you peter smith?

25:38.036 --> 25:39.102
I am.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.704
Do you have a son
named peter junior?

25:40.706 --> 25:41.639
-I do.
-Oh.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.807
Is this your puppy?

25:43.809 --> 25:47.177
No, it isn't. I wish it was.
Such a cute fellow.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.679
Oh! I'll buy him from you.

25:48.814 --> 25:50.447
How much?

25:50.449 --> 25:51.982
Ah, I'll give
you five dollars.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.117
That's a lot
of money.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.919
But it's not his.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.254
We've checked all
the addresses west of the river.

25:58.291 --> 25:59.657
What about east
of the river?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.792
We don't even
have a list for that.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.226
Then we'd better
get started.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.396
Apologies.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.799
[coughing]

26:11.136 --> 26:12.936
-What's going on?
-Get mrs. Brackenreid.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.539
Sir? It's after midnight.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.475
-Is everyone all right?
-Yes. Why?

26:18.611 --> 26:21.344
-Is that smoke I smell?
-Yes.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.879
We believe someone's
trying to kill us.

26:22.881 --> 26:23.881
All of us?

26:23.883 --> 26:26.216
No. Just the two of us,
it would seem.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.684
Oh, well,
that's a relief.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.086
[distant scream]

26:29.088 --> 26:30.153
Ruthie?

26:34.327 --> 26:36.827
I stepped on it!

26:36.896 --> 26:38.328
Is that what killed it?

26:38.397 --> 26:40.063
I believe it was
dead already.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.098
Murdoch: Well, perhaps
we are all targets.

26:43.168 --> 26:44.902
I don't think so.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.903
Unless you gave me
a rattlesnake for christmas.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.004
Pardon?

26:52.612 --> 26:53.777
It's dry.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.378
Well, did you think
it would be wet?

26:55.414 --> 26:56.913
A bit slimy, anyways.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.517
What happened to
the gift I made for you?

27:00.553 --> 27:03.720
I think it must have been
swapped out for a rattlesnake.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.188
Bloody hell.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.790
Does this mean
you're the target?

27:06.826 --> 27:10.127
Well, sir, we're the only two
who knew who that box was for.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.530
Well, then it's more likely
it's you, me ol' mucker.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.733
It's got to be
one of the servants.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.335
Sir, what if one of them is a
criminal you've helped convict?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.304
My money's on the butler.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.905
He's got a very
strange accent.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.207
Oh, thomas,
you just can't place it.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.608
I think it's the cook.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.410
Why do you say that?

27:27.446 --> 27:29.046
She can't cook.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.114
Well, surely she's
not alone in that.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.916
William!

27:32.985 --> 27:34.184
Ruth:
I think it's the maid.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.620
Every time jordan
sees her, she cries.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.188
What?

27:38.323 --> 27:39.723
Well, that's
very suspicious.

27:39.725 --> 27:41.291
Right.
How did the snake die?

27:41.360 --> 27:43.594
That's a good question.
I intend to find out.

27:43.596 --> 27:45.362
Right.
Let's get the servants up.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.697
Sir, we need to learn more

27:46.699 --> 27:48.966
Before we begin
leveling accusations.

27:49.101 --> 27:52.436
We won't get answers until
we've asked questions, murdoch.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.238
But, sir, if the killer
is still intent,

27:54.240 --> 27:55.972
We could be placing
ourselves in danger.

27:55.974 --> 27:57.174
Right, then.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.277
Let's go!

28:03.816 --> 28:05.683
Burnside:
What's this all about, sir?

28:05.818 --> 28:07.751
Don't 'sir' me.
Where are you from?

28:07.753 --> 28:08.652
The accent?

28:08.787 --> 28:10.053
Sir.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.588
-Hampshire.
-Bollocks.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.457
But I spent my
childhood in cornwall.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.192
Uh.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.528
I suppose that does explain
the west country twang

28:17.663 --> 28:18.995
Every now and again.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.131
What time is it?
What's going on?

28:21.133 --> 28:23.467
What's going on is
that one of you three

28:23.469 --> 28:25.202
Is trying to kill
detective murdoch.

28:30.443 --> 28:31.908
Yes, I know that
it is christmas.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.811
Yes, I know what
time it is

28:33.813 --> 28:36.146
And that's why I'm
offering you 50 dollars.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.748
Thank you.

28:39.618 --> 28:42.052
I've got a list
of 64 names.

28:42.121 --> 28:45.488
If we start calling now
it shouldn't take too long.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.359
Merry christmas,
detective.

28:49.428 --> 28:50.727
You too, detective.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.098
Merry christmas, operator.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.367
Could you please call...

28:57.503 --> 28:59.469
Fp 347?

29:01.507 --> 29:02.572
Ogden:
When I cut open the snake,

29:02.608 --> 29:05.042
I found the mouse,
partially digested.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.811
When I dissected the mouse,
I found this.

29:07.946 --> 29:09.379
Sugar plum.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.447
I found traces of it

29:10.582 --> 29:12.516
In the snake's digestive
system, as well.

29:12.651 --> 29:13.951
Poison.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.919
I suspect cyanide.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.254
That was
your sugar plum.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.323
Yes.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.124
I believe I'm the target.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.326
That makes no sense.

29:22.461 --> 29:25.161
It does if you consider
the laws of survivorship.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.197
Which are?

29:27.233 --> 29:30.400
They pertain to situations
where the beneficiary of a will

29:30.436 --> 29:32.135
Dies shortly
after the testator.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.870
How long after?

29:33.939 --> 29:35.739
Within a month, usually.

29:35.874 --> 29:39.143
Mr. Maitland died
a month ago tomorrow.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.745
What happens
in that case?

29:41.747 --> 29:43.247
The will would
be nullified.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.948
Ogden: Then who would
be the beneficiary?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.016
His immediate family.

29:46.085 --> 29:47.350
But there are none.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.752
Effie: There's always
family somewhere.

29:48.754 --> 29:50.620
If not immediate,
then cousins.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.622
Second cousins.

29:52.658 --> 29:54.158
Is it possible one
of the servants

29:54.293 --> 29:55.358
Is a second cousin?

29:55.394 --> 29:59.963
No! The tableau is ruined!

30:00.032 --> 30:02.098
I hardly think
that's important.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.700
Look.

30:03.736 --> 30:05.702
The reflection
in the mirror!

30:06.972 --> 30:09.673
Ogden: Oh! You can see
me sneezing, I think.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.810
Murdoch:
Oh, yes, you can.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.445
And that's not all, julia.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.146
Take a look behind you.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.649
I knew there was
someone behind me!

30:20.719 --> 30:21.918
Murdoch:
That's the axe that we used

30:21.954 --> 30:23.520
To cut down the christmas tree.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.855
Oh my god.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.456
Someone was trying
to cut off my head!

30:26.525 --> 30:29.459
All the servants are
accounted for in the photograph.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.760
It can't be any of them.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.272
Right.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.540
The photograph
was taken from here.

30:44.577 --> 30:47.810
That means the hooded
figure was standing...

30:47.847 --> 30:49.880
Somewhere here.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.681
Sir, there's no way.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.751
There's no way he
could have come in and left

30:54.887 --> 30:55.852
Without us noticing him.

31:08.601 --> 31:09.833
Good lord.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.268
George, with me.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.203
Right.

31:27.786 --> 31:28.919
Sir.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.389
Sir?

31:38.196 --> 31:39.262
My goodness.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.867
One thing I'll say
for irwin maitland:

31:44.002 --> 31:46.536
He certainly
understood children.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.872
Well, he did that,
george.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.278
Sir, what's this?

32:15.434 --> 32:17.033
Sir, look.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.645
I suppose that
explains my ghost.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.530
Off you go, george.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.020
Crabtree:
Sir, what's this?

33:10.889 --> 33:15.625
It's my gift for julia.

33:15.661 --> 33:16.859
Sir.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.171
Who is he?

33:28.207 --> 33:29.706
I have no idea.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.383
He's been shot

33:39.518 --> 33:41.251
But he clearly hasn't
been here that long.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.719
I don't remember
hearing a gunshot.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.587
Neither do I.

33:45.858 --> 33:46.989
Unless...

34:00.005 --> 34:02.205
I'm very sorry.

34:02.340 --> 34:05.208
Yes. Merry christmas.

34:08.814 --> 34:10.346
I thought
you'd abandoned me.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.416
Of course you did.
I went to get gifts!

34:12.551 --> 34:14.884
Where did you buy
gifts at five o'clock

34:14.920 --> 34:16.286
On christmas morning?

34:16.355 --> 34:17.754
Everything can be
solved with money.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.889
Ah. Ah, hello? Operator?

34:19.925 --> 34:20.957
<i> Operator:</i>
<i> Detective?</i>

34:21.026 --> 34:25.829
Yes, me again.
Please call ft 3827.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.029
<i> Operator:</i>
<i> It would be my pleasure.</i>

34:27.066 --> 34:28.298
I appreciate that.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.033
I promise this
is the last one.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.301
<i> Operator:</i>
<i> Well, all right, then.</i>

34:37.176 --> 34:38.374
<i> Woman:</i>
<i> Hello?</i>

34:38.410 --> 34:39.642
Merry christmas.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.177
I apologize
for waking you.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.712
<i> Woman:</i>
<i> You didn't wake us.</i>

34:42.748 --> 34:44.848
<i> My husband just got home.</i>

34:44.917 --> 34:47.317
<i> Spent the whole night</i>
<i> looking for a lost puppy.</i>

34:47.386 --> 34:51.654
Well, I predict you are going to
have a very good christmas.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.126
Is he the one
behind all this?

34:56.128 --> 34:58.694
He had unseen access to nearly
every room in the house.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.464
There are secret
passageways everywhere.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.666
How would he have
known about them?

35:02.801 --> 35:05.602
He was shot, but he's only
been dead for a few hours.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.003
Who would have shot him?

35:07.139 --> 35:09.205
You did.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.339
What?

35:10.375 --> 35:12.075
Your christmas
cracker was loaded

35:12.210 --> 35:14.744
With a secret
bullet of some sort.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.480
You're saying he was
just in the wrong place

35:17.549 --> 35:19.015
At the wrong time?

35:19.151 --> 35:20.750
So, who is he?

35:20.752 --> 35:22.218
And why did he
want to kill julia?

35:23.455 --> 35:25.421
Murdoch: Have any of you
ever seen this man before?

35:25.457 --> 35:26.923
Never seen him
before in my life.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.791
I may have an
answer.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.960
I've looked through all
mr. Maitland's files

35:31.029 --> 35:34.497
And his former wife
divorced him and remarried,

35:34.566 --> 35:37.567
But her new husband never
formally adopted his children.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.503
What does that mean?

35:39.638 --> 35:42.839
If dr. Ogden dies
in the next few hours,

35:42.908 --> 35:45.374
The stepchildren inherit
his entire estate.

35:45.410 --> 35:48.178
And if I live
beyond christmas day?

35:48.180 --> 35:50.613
They get nothing.
Everything goes to the orphans.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.819
What, so is this chap
one of the stepchildren?

35:55.821 --> 35:58.922
Oh, my god. It's john.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.256
Who's john?

36:00.325 --> 36:02.125
He was the eldest,
I believe.

36:02.194 --> 36:05.328
Shortly after I started,
he showed up for a visit.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.931
It turned out he
was trolling for money.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.799
He ended up
stealing the silver.

36:09.935 --> 36:13.002
Mr. Maitland had him
banished from the house.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.071
He learned that his
stepfather had died

36:15.073 --> 36:17.740
And cooked up a plan
to get part of the estate.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.143
It appears

36:20.278 --> 36:22.679
That I need to
make some apologies.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.146
Burnside:
Not at all, sir.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.481
I would have been
suspicious myself.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.823
Is it christmas yet?

36:33.959 --> 36:36.559
Yes, it is.
And I have a present.

36:39.064 --> 36:40.430
A teddy bear!

36:41.633 --> 36:43.233
And for you.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.368
Oh, boy! Mine's a gun!

36:45.437 --> 36:47.069
Wake up, mo.
There's presents!

36:48.373 --> 36:49.839
Stick 'em up,
copper!

36:49.841 --> 36:51.575
Maureen:
What's going on?

36:51.710 --> 36:52.942
I've got
a present for you.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.181
A book! Black beauty!

36:58.183 --> 36:59.815
It was my favourite
when I was a little girl.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.018
Coats on, everyone.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.486
We've got one more
job ahead of us.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.163
I never noticed before.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.798
The secret passageway
is built into the dollhouse.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.667
Really?

37:17.802 --> 37:19.335
Huh.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.871
Shame we didn't know
about that earlier.

37:21.907 --> 37:25.742
You know, I have to
admit I always wished

37:25.744 --> 37:27.743
I'd had something like
this when I was a boy.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.279
A dollhouse?

37:29.414 --> 37:31.348
Well, you know, a-a...

37:31.350 --> 37:33.749
A miniature version
of our own world.

37:35.254 --> 37:37.220
The taller one
must be john.

37:39.224 --> 37:40.824
You know, I wonder if
the other three had any idea

37:40.959 --> 37:43.426
That they were within
a whisker of claiming

37:43.462 --> 37:45.561
A three and a half million
dollar inheritance?

37:49.368 --> 37:50.700
George.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.272
Good lord!

38:11.589 --> 38:12.722
Murdoch:
Smells delicious!

38:12.724 --> 38:14.156
Coffee, ma'am?

38:14.158 --> 38:16.326
Certainly. Thank you.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.927
Do you have any sugar?

38:17.929 --> 38:19.762
Just a moment, sir.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.000
One lump or two?

38:24.069 --> 38:26.736
It's christmas day.
I think I'll have two, please.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.174
Thank you.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.044
Brackenreid:
I'll have three.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.914
Has she gone deaf?

38:37.916 --> 38:39.982
Margaret: She's gone to
get more, calm down.

38:51.196 --> 38:53.229
Crabtree:
Wait! Stop! Nobody move!

38:53.365 --> 38:54.830
Doctor, don't drink that.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.132
Murdoch:
George?

38:56.134 --> 38:57.133
They're not servants.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.601
They're the stepchildren.

38:58.737 --> 38:59.836
Ruth:
What's going on?

38:59.838 --> 39:01.738
I'm not sure, honey pie.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.907
Brackenreid: I knew there was
something off about that accent!

39:04.042 --> 39:06.242
She's not a cook
at all! Ugh!

39:06.311 --> 39:07.644
Murdoch:
George, arrest them!

39:44.082 --> 39:46.182
Sir, they're in the walls.

39:58.697 --> 39:59.829
Merry christmas.

39:59.964 --> 40:00.996
Are you paul?

40:01.032 --> 40:03.166
I'm paul junior.
You want to speak to my dad?

40:03.235 --> 40:06.469
No, it's all right, pj.
I think this is for you.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.071
Surprise!

40:08.073 --> 40:10.139
It's a puppy!
You remembered!

40:10.141 --> 40:11.908
Come on in. It's christmas.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.709
Daddy, I got a puppy!

40:13.745 --> 40:15.645
You heard him.
Come inside!

40:15.647 --> 40:17.013
-We shouldn't.
-Nonsense.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.181
I've just made us all
a big christmas breakfast.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.183
You must be starving.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.456
Watts:
Thank you.

40:53.518 --> 40:54.717
Oh.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.891
Aye aye.
Come here. Come here!

41:03.294 --> 41:05.060
You've never even been
to britain, have you?

41:06.231 --> 41:07.830
No, I have not.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.232
Good work, crabtree.

41:18.576 --> 41:21.177
But I've got her all dressed
for a ride in the sled!

41:21.312 --> 41:23.379
I can't leave until we've
caught the last one, ruthie.

41:23.381 --> 41:24.781
Well, if you haven't
caught her yet,

41:24.783 --> 41:26.516
She's probably gone.

41:26.518 --> 41:28.985
[baby cries]

41:29.120 --> 41:30.586
Henry, she's going
to hurt our baby!

41:39.064 --> 41:40.129
Sir.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.397
Was that the police again?

41:41.399 --> 41:42.732
No, a telegram
from detective watts.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.800
Apparently, he's got three
orphans at the ready.

41:44.802 --> 41:47.003
Oh! How wonderful.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.005
They're going to
love it here.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.439
Thank you.

41:52.277 --> 41:53.743
Dare I?

41:58.550 --> 42:00.082
What is it?

42:01.152 --> 42:02.551
It's spring-activated.

42:02.587 --> 42:03.520
Wind it up.

42:07.659 --> 42:09.425
[rain sounds]

42:09.427 --> 42:11.427
It sounds like rain
on a tin roof.

42:11.429 --> 42:12.795
Like the galapagos!

42:12.931 --> 42:14.330
You slept
so well there.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.299
I've made another that
sounds just like waves

42:16.434 --> 42:17.967
Crashing on the shore.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.101
Thank you, william.

42:22.040 --> 42:25.642
Now, I have a very
special gift for you.

42:25.644 --> 42:26.709
In the bedroom.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.786
A sleeping baby.

42:36.921 --> 42:39.522
Now that's
a christmas miracle.

42:39.657 --> 42:41.324
What are you
insinuating?

42:41.393 --> 42:42.659
Oh!

42:42.794 --> 42:45.328
Just that it's
a wonderful time of life.

42:45.397 --> 42:46.863
Oh.

42:46.998 --> 42:48.831
It truly is.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.407
A special
present, eh?

42:57.542 --> 42:59.208
It's not that,
william.

42:59.277 --> 43:02.611
Oh. What is it, then?

43:07.752 --> 43:10.453
We're going to
have a child.

43:10.455 --> 43:12.956
Julia.

43:15.694 --> 43:17.059
We're going to
have a child.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.965
Oh, oh.

43:22.100 --> 43:25.334
Oh. Oh.

43:25.370 --> 43:28.504
Julia, I am so happy.

43:31.242 --> 43:32.875
Merry christmas.

43:32.877 --> 43:34.777
Merry christmas,
william.

43:36.615 --> 43:37.946
Oh!

43:41.786 --> 43:46.656
