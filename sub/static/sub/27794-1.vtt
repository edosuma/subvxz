00:54.068 --> 00:58.405
Hello.
It's for Mylène, my cousin.

00:58.697 --> 01:00.782
She's crazy about you, I love you too.

01:01.533 --> 01:03.910
Your novel moved me.

01:04.870 --> 01:07.081
What it says is so true.

01:07.081 --> 01:09.834
Thank you for everything you do.
Thank you.

01:13.254 --> 01:14.505
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:14.505 --> 01:18.175
I'm so happy to meet you.
I loved your book.

01:18.175 --> 01:20.176
It's for my daughter.

01:20.176 --> 01:22.471
- What's her name?
- Justine.

01:22.471 --> 01:26.183
It is for her 37th birthday.

01:26.183 --> 01:28.770
I'm sure she will like it very much.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.771
It's beautiful.

01:30.771 --> 01:32.188
Thank you.

01:33.815 --> 01:35.401
- Hi, Delphine.
- For whom?

01:35.401 --> 01:37.444
It's for my mother.

01:37.444 --> 01:40.239
It's her birthday and she's a huge fan of yours.

01:40.239 --> 01:42.408
- What's her name?
- Nathalie.

01:42.741 --> 01:46.745
She talks about you continuously.
It's absurd.

01:48.247 --> 01:50.874
- Thank you so much. Good day.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

01:57.506 --> 01:58.632
For Jeanne.

01:59.592 --> 02:00.426
For Jeanne.

02:02.511 --> 02:04.847
I have been in the hospital for a long time

02:04.847 --> 02:08.434
and your book gave me an incredible hope...

02:08.434 --> 02:14.189
that despite the disease, despite...
all we have been through,

02:14.189 --> 02:16.942
my children perhaps could love me one day.

02:17.984 --> 02:19.946
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

02:22.615 --> 02:26.828
- That's enough. That's enough. That's enough.
- Enough? But there are other people.

02:27.787 --> 02:30.832
Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but for today it's all.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.960
She's here since this morning at 8.00am.

02:42.635 --> 02:44.636
Just one more.

02:45.179 --> 02:47.389
For your most fierce fan.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.352
They will get back in line.

02:51.352 --> 02:54.146
If you do it discreetly, nobody will notice.

02:54.146 --> 02:58.234
If I do another, I'll collapse.
I swear I'll sign it.

02:58.234 --> 03:00.778
I took a long trip to get here.

03:07.493 --> 03:11.205
- Do I have to come?
- Just show your face and then you can go.

03:11.205 --> 03:13.457
- I'm exhausted.
- Just a few minutes.

03:32.309 --> 03:36.230
- I only do it to make you happy.
- They came for you.

03:36.230 --> 03:40.484
- Who?
- Dealers, foreign publishers ...

03:41.568 --> 03:43.280
- Karina.
- Just a few minutes.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.906
- Delphine.
- Thanks, Oriane.

03:47.241 --> 03:48.826
Cheers.

03:52.163 --> 03:56.125
Leonello Brandolini what a pleasure!

03:56.125 --> 03:59.462
What a nice evening!
Hello, how are you?

03:59.837 --> 04:02.465
Mrs. Dayrieux, what a pleasure to see you.

04:02.465 --> 04:04.216
- You do not remember me, do you?
- No.

04:04.216 --> 04:07.219
I'm Leonello Brandolini,
your Italian publisher.

04:07.219 --> 04:09.806
And thank you for your book.
And what a book!

04:10.097 --> 04:13.143
Is gorgeous. You made me cry.

04:13.143 --> 04:16.687
But sales do not, those do not make us cry.

04:17.230 --> 04:19.398
Tell me something...

04:45.467 --> 04:47.802
I'm sorry, for earlier.

04:47.802 --> 04:49.387
It does not matter.

04:49.387 --> 04:51.848
This is a difficult book for me.

04:51.848 --> 04:56.436
- I'm happy to have met you.
I admire your work.

04:56.436 --> 04:58.520
Sometimes it seems to me ...

04:58.520 --> 05:03.318
that you write only for me,
that you read my thoughts.

05:03.318 --> 05:06.528
- Do you have the book with you?
- Of course.

05:15.122 --> 05:17.498
- And this is to...?
- To Elle.

05:17.498 --> 05:20.502
- Elle (her)?
- Yes, diminutive of Élisabeth.

05:35.642 --> 05:36.976
Thank you.

05:38.978 --> 05:40.855
A glass of Vodka?

05:41.899 --> 05:43.525
Why not?

06:10.927 --> 06:13.471
I'd like to know how you work.

06:13.471 --> 06:16.224
Do you take notes or use a recorder?

06:16.224 --> 06:18.893
I take notes. In the notebooks.

06:19.435 --> 06:22.439
- I always carry them with me.
- Always?

06:22.439 --> 06:24.274
Yes, they give me security.

06:24.274 --> 06:27.194
- Can I see them?
- See them?

06:27.903 --> 06:30.572
Quiet down, I do not want to open them.

06:39.331 --> 06:40.915
I have four.

06:41.458 --> 06:44.127
One for the book I'm working on.

06:44.877 --> 06:48.298
Two for titles or ideas.

06:49.048 --> 06:51.969
And this is for personal things.

06:55.347 --> 06:57.933
It must be hard now.

06:58.851 --> 07:02.645
The success, the comments,
the reactions of the family ...

07:03.021 --> 07:05.106
The sudden limelight.

07:05.106 --> 07:07.775
I guess it's on the verge of collapse.

07:09.026 --> 07:12.905
Of the collapse?
It seems a little exaggerated.

07:12.905 --> 07:15.825
And yet, despite everything,
sometimes you will feel alone.

07:54.906 --> 07:56.533
- Yes?
- Are you ready?

07:56.533 --> 08:00.578
- Not at all, I'm destroyed.
- I'll take you to rest.

08:04.374 --> 08:05.792
How was the party?

08:06.418 --> 08:09.587
You did not miss anything. Yours?

08:09.587 --> 08:12.841
I was stuck with Amos Oz and Sollers.

08:13.425 --> 08:15.636
Then there was a reception ...

08:16.428 --> 08:18.221
I left early.

08:22.184 --> 08:24.227
I met an interesting woman.

08:25.312 --> 08:27.522
Do you like women now?

08:28.023 --> 08:29.858
Stop that.

08:30.693 --> 08:33.904
We talked all evening. It was nice.

08:35.113 --> 08:38.616
She's a good listener, she's very careful.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.578
Good listeners are rare.

08:43.246 --> 08:45.374
- What's her name?
- Elle.

08:45.374 --> 08:48.626
- Yes, what's her name?
- I told you. Elle.

08:48.626 --> 08:50.503
- She's called Elle?
- Yes.

08:50.503 --> 08:51.713
Diminutive of Élisabeth.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.983
- May I?
- Of course, Raymond.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.611
- I saw the car.
- Do you want a coffee?

09:13.611 --> 09:17.530
No thanks. I brought you a cider.

09:17.530 --> 09:20.534
Oh, thank you, you did not have to.
Very nice.

09:20.534 --> 09:22.244
So cute.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.705
I have Delphine's book.

09:24.705 --> 09:28.083
I'd like it if you signed it for me.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.168
Sorry, I should have thought about it.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.255
Here.

09:36.592 --> 09:40.721
My wife also spent a difficult time years ago.

09:41.638 --> 09:43.599
She was also hospitalized.

09:44.558 --> 09:46.519
It seems like your story.

09:46.519 --> 09:50.189
- She did not commit suicide.
- Thank God, no.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.232
No, now it's fine.

09:54.568 --> 09:56.737
Thank you. Good...

09:57.654 --> 10:00.115
See you then.

10:00.115 --> 10:03.118
- Don't you want to stay?
- No thanks.

10:04.161 --> 10:06.205
- Good day.
- Thank you.

10:06.205 --> 10:08.290
The boys are suffering.

10:08.290 --> 10:11.209
- I miss them.
- It's normal that you miss them.

10:12.085 --> 10:13.671
But you are more free.

10:13.671 --> 10:16.631
- To come here?
- Also.

10:16.631 --> 10:20.886
I meant to write. Research for months.

10:20.886 --> 10:25.349
- You should start.
- Research is a large part of the job.

10:25.349 --> 10:29.187
I know you... It takes time, of course.

10:29.187 --> 10:30.938
But you are hesitating.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.233
It's a big step, a new adventure.

10:35.233 --> 10:40.531
I will spend two years with
these characters, it's normal.

10:40.531 --> 10:44.535
- What's normal?
- Reflect, ask questions.

10:45.160 --> 10:49.122
Do I really want to do it?
Are they really so interesting?

10:49.790 --> 10:53.752
What if I was wrong? Things like that.

10:53.752 --> 10:55.879
- Do you think you're wrong?
- No.

10:55.879 --> 10:57.340
Not at all.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.176
I'm ready.

11:02.302 --> 11:04.513
I'm happy to start.

11:13.522 --> 11:17.109
"It's easy to turn your life into storytelling

11:17.109 --> 11:19.528
changing some names.

11:19.528 --> 11:23.032
Do you think you can go back
to your usual good life?

11:23.032 --> 11:24.867
It's too late.

11:24.867 --> 11:28.329
Your mother's slaughter
made you break through.

11:28.329 --> 11:32.332
Pay the family saga well, eh?
You're making big money.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.627
So send the check, thank you."

12:51.579 --> 12:54.916
- Hello?
- Hello. It's Elle.

12:57.669 --> 13:00.004
It's crazy to call like this.

13:00.004 --> 13:04.008
I did not know if I could
use your number so soon.

13:04.008 --> 13:05.802
I gave it to you.

13:06.385 --> 13:10.098
Yes, but people do it
so as not to be rude.

13:11.224 --> 13:14.018
Are you free... for a coffee?

13:14.018 --> 13:15.728
Yes, why not?

13:21.484 --> 13:25.196
- Sorry if I bothered you.
- No, I'm glad to see you.

13:25.196 --> 13:26.530
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:26.530 --> 13:29.117
- A Tariquet, as usual?
- Yes thanks.

13:31.494 --> 13:34.913
I talked a lot about myself,
but I know nothing about you.

13:34.913 --> 13:37.959
- I'm not an interesting person.
- In my opinion, yes.

13:38.709 --> 13:41.004
But you are not obliged.
Thank you.

13:42.213 --> 13:44.382
I write for others.

13:44.382 --> 13:47.761
That is, they pay me
to write the lives of others.

13:47.761 --> 13:50.429
Actors, politicians ...

13:51.515 --> 13:53.766
You write and they sign.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.686
An invisible literary species.
The ghosts of celebrities.

13:58.396 --> 14:01.024
So you choose your customers?

14:01.024 --> 14:03.360
You mean "my patients".

14:05.986 --> 14:08.865
And now who is your patient?

14:09.948 --> 14:11.868
A TV presenter.

14:11.868 --> 14:16.080
Last summer we did 30 hours of interviews.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.333
Now I'm trying to turn them into a book.

14:20.418 --> 14:23.087
And do not you want to
write something about yourself?

14:23.672 --> 14:26.508
- On me?
- On your life.

14:27.091 --> 14:30.053
Oh! My life is a mortal bore.

14:30.053 --> 14:34.223
My husband died many years ago,
I live alone. No children.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.559
By choice?

14:36.559 --> 14:38.520
However, it is not a regret.

14:39.353 --> 14:44.192
We make separate lives.
It works like this, between us.

14:44.859 --> 14:48.029
I am afraid of habit, of compromise.

14:48.029 --> 14:51.699
How life can be
after a few years together.

14:51.699 --> 14:54.285
People envy you a lot.

14:54.285 --> 14:55.995
Did you search me on Google?

14:55.995 --> 14:57.831
Not need to Google you, everyone knows it.

14:58.456 --> 15:00.124
Everybody knows?

15:00.124 --> 15:03.002
Yes, you're with a TV presenter.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.464
He was criticized for inviting you.

15:05.464 --> 15:08.050
Should I be banned from your program?

15:08.050 --> 15:12.762
- People are envious, it's normal.
- Normal?

15:13.221 --> 15:16.475
Many writers would like to be invited.
Me included.

15:20.812 --> 15:25.274
Heck, I had forgotten. I have to run.
I have to see myself with my publisher.

15:25.817 --> 15:27.069
- The bill, please.
- Yes.

15:27.069 --> 15:29.403
- Where is it?
- At the sixth.

15:29.403 --> 15:31.990
I'm going that way, I'll take you there.

15:40.164 --> 15:43.502
- Your children are gone?
- Yes.

15:43.502 --> 15:45.628
They left me.

15:46.338 --> 15:49.382
Paul is in an art school in Belgium.

15:49.925 --> 15:53.636
And my daughter wants to
get into civil aviation.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.056
She is studying in Lyon.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.601
Your daughter wants to be a pilot?

15:59.601 --> 16:01.436
Do you imagine?

16:08.026 --> 16:09.653
It's my stop.

16:11.195 --> 16:12.446
Hello.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.142
Shit, my notebooks!

17:32.694 --> 17:33.988
Hello?

17:35.614 --> 17:37.199
Of course I am at home.

17:38.742 --> 17:40.284
You see me?

17:41.871 --> 17:43.080
Really?

17:44.080 --> 17:46.875
Where are you? I do not see you.

17:53.632 --> 17:55.259
Incredible.

17:56.802 --> 17:58.553
When?

17:58.553 --> 18:00.097
Saturday?

18:01.015 --> 18:02.807
I'll let you know if I'm free.

18:03.934 --> 18:05.644
Thanks anyway.

18:21.243 --> 18:23.120
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:23.788 --> 18:25.497
You look beautiful.

18:27.792 --> 18:30.920
Am I the first?
I thought I was late.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.629
Not at all.

18:32.629 --> 18:34.757
Congratulations.

18:34.757 --> 18:37.426
I had said no gifts or flowers.

18:37.426 --> 18:39.428
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

18:42.306 --> 18:43.808
I forgive you.

18:44.808 --> 18:47.311
I will open it with the others.

18:50.648 --> 18:54.777
Wow, I'm impressed!
Do you cook for two days?

18:56.028 --> 18:57.613
Unbelievable.

18:58.531 --> 19:00.199
Someone from the family?

19:00.199 --> 19:03.160
I think so, but maybe it is not.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.706
- You'll have some ideas.
- Actually, no.

19:10.793 --> 19:13.087
Your next book: After.

19:13.796 --> 19:15.172
After what?

19:15.172 --> 19:17.299
After your last book.

19:17.299 --> 19:20.761
The consequences, what it caused, what it revealed.

19:20.761 --> 19:23.013
I have been working for months
on a novel of realistic fiction.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.057
Oh, Delphine ...

19:25.474 --> 19:27.601
Realistic fiction, really?

19:27.601 --> 19:31.313
You are far beyond this.
Take a reason.

19:33.315 --> 19:37.236
They will not come.
It'll be just the two of us.

19:39.404 --> 19:42.074
- We'll still wait a little bit.
- No.

19:42.699 --> 19:45.870
- Call, so we'll be sure.
- No, it's a waste of time.

19:48.914 --> 19:53.168
- But, you talked to them, right?
- I sent a group email ...

19:53.168 --> 19:56.213
as I do every year and they did not come.

20:03.429 --> 20:05.472
At least, open your gift.

20:35.419 --> 20:40.257
I'm glad you came.
You can not understand how much it means to me.

20:48.558 --> 20:52.687
After my husband's death,
his friends stopped answering me.

20:52.687 --> 20:55.856
I keep inviting them,
but they never come.

20:55.856 --> 20:57.692
Do you know why?

21:00.945 --> 21:03.738
I can not talk about it, I'm not ready.

21:04.615 --> 21:07.076
One day, I'll tell you.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.831
It is the synopsis of the book I would like to write.

21:11.831 --> 21:13.666
Take a look.

21:15.209 --> 21:17.962
I would very much like to have your opinion.

21:27.597 --> 21:30.015
It's very crowded.

21:33.978 --> 21:37.272
Mrs. Dayrieux, I am very happy
that you could come.

21:37.272 --> 21:38.984
- The pleasure is mine.
- Good evening.

21:38.984 --> 21:41.110
I have a surprise for you, come.

21:50.370 --> 21:51.787
Come.

22:09.805 --> 22:12.432
We know the reduced version
from the cover of your book,

22:12.432 --> 22:15.853
but I thought it deserved to be seen life-size,

22:15.853 --> 22:17.647
in its entirety.

22:18.773 --> 22:21.026
I must apologize,
I have to go to say hello.

22:21.026 --> 22:22.693
I will be right back.

22:22.693 --> 22:24.487
Good evening.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.950
Seriously, let's go.

22:30.868 --> 22:34.247
- Do not you want to wait for Karina?
- No, I have to go.

22:35.247 --> 22:36.832
All right?

23:19.084 --> 23:20.501
Hello?

23:21.085 --> 23:23.838
It's me. Did I wake you up?

23:23.838 --> 23:26.174
Yes, more or less.

23:26.174 --> 23:31.137
I'm sorry to call you so soon,
but I have a big problem.

23:31.137 --> 23:34.807
- Do you have a recorder?
- Yes sure.

23:35.766 --> 23:39.395
Would you mind lending me right away?
It's really urgent.

23:58.123 --> 24:00.834
Here it is.
I'll show you how it works?

24:00.834 --> 24:02.918
No, I have one like that.

24:03.962 --> 24:06.547
I do not know how you can be
impeccable in the early morning.

24:06.547 --> 24:10.051
- I would never be able to.
- Of course yes, all women can.

24:10.051 --> 24:11.302
I do not believe.

24:11.302 --> 24:15.222
How you see yourself and how others see you...
Are two different things.

24:15.222 --> 24:17.767
So, what do you need this morning?

24:17.767 --> 24:20.478
- A coffee with cream and a buttered baguette.
- Very well.

24:22.522 --> 24:25.775
Thank you for trusting me.
I read it very carefully.

24:25.775 --> 24:29.362
- The characters are still sketchy.
- Yes, yes.

24:29.362 --> 24:32.615
But I believe that the narrative arc
and the structure are solid.

24:32.615 --> 24:34.951
- I think there is some material ...
- I liked it a lot.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.577
- Yes?
- Seriously.

24:36.577 --> 24:40.623
Ah, thank you very much, it helps me.
I needed feedback before ...

24:40.623 --> 24:43.584
- I think it works.
- Before I get to work.

24:43.584 --> 24:47.422
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

24:49.340 --> 24:52.885
Last night, I made love
with a man in a hotel room.

24:52.885 --> 24:57.223
At 05:00 or 06:00 I dressed and
took a taxi to go home and...

24:57.223 --> 24:59.767
- I had forgotten the keys.
- Do you have a duplicate?

24:59.767 --> 25:02.103
Yes, but the maid arrives at 11:00.

25:02.103 --> 25:05.482
And first I have an appointment with
a politician in the National Assembly.

25:05.482 --> 25:08.359
- I started working for her.
- It's interesting?

25:08.359 --> 25:11.904
Fascinating. No, I'm joking.

25:11.904 --> 25:14.365
Come, I want to smoke.

25:14.783 --> 25:19.204
You know, Delphine...
I want to be honest with you.

25:19.204 --> 25:22.540
At the cost of looking a little...
A bit brutal.

25:23.916 --> 25:26.211
I lied to you first.

25:29.881 --> 25:32.259
I find your synopsis without interest.

25:32.259 --> 25:35.095
I do not mean it sucks,
it's just not interesting.

25:35.095 --> 25:37.347
It has nothing to do with you.

25:37.347 --> 25:41.602
It would be a big mistake
to waste time, just because ...

25:41.602 --> 25:44.438
you are afraid to write what you should write.

25:45.521 --> 25:51.778
Of course, if you talk to your publisher,
it will tell you it's a great idea.

25:51.778 --> 25:55.282
They're not crazy, they have to
put some money back into their coffers.

25:55.282 --> 25:57.575
Let's not delude ourselves,
they do not care about anything else.

25:57.575 --> 25:59.328
Even if your book is bad,

25:59.328 --> 26:03.540
however, they will succeed in
trimming it back to a few thousand readers.

26:07.336 --> 26:11.298
It annoys me to leave tomorrow morning.
Leave yourself alone.

26:12.090 --> 26:15.761
- Are you sure it's okay?
- No, my pleasure.

26:17.262 --> 26:20.431
- Elle helps me a lot.
- She?

26:20.431 --> 26:24.895
- What do you mean?
- I can talk to her about my work,

26:24.895 --> 26:28.940
of essential questions, of very intimate things.

26:29.441 --> 26:32.318
Sometimes I have the impression
that she destabilizes you.

26:32.735 --> 26:35.196
Not at all. Well...

26:35.196 --> 26:38.409
her opinions may be a bit too radical, but ...

26:38.409 --> 26:42.120
even if I do not always agree,
it's still stimulating.

26:42.120 --> 26:45.291
It forces me to clarify my convictions.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.086
Look.

26:53.299 --> 26:55.341
She bought me some new notebooks.

26:58.637 --> 27:02.098
It worries me. You're writing?

27:03.016 --> 27:06.269
Not exactly. Not yet, but it will happen.

27:07.020 --> 27:09.022
When will you return?

27:10.356 --> 27:13.319
I'll be in Texas first to meet Cormac McCarthy,

27:13.319 --> 27:17.823
then in Los Angeles
for Bret Easton Ellis and Joan Didion.

27:17.823 --> 27:21.034
You have the chance to meet her,
I love her works.

27:21.034 --> 27:24.330
Then I will have a few free days
before meeting Don DeLillo in New York.

27:24.330 --> 27:27.916
In all... I'll be away for three weeks.

27:27.916 --> 27:29.585
And then you will have finished?

27:29.585 --> 27:33.046
After there will be Ian McEwan,
but it's in London, it's easier.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.425
They offered me a third season.

27:36.883 --> 27:38.844
But I refused.

27:39.428 --> 27:42.556
I do not want to be away from you for so long.

28:41.157 --> 28:42.741
"It's a burden ...

28:42.741 --> 28:45.411
be in your family, share your name.

28:45.411 --> 28:47.664
Now it's a real burden.

28:47.664 --> 28:51.208
The name you appropriated and dragged into shit.

28:51.208 --> 28:54.420
I'm part of the author's family and it pisses me off.

28:54.420 --> 28:57.339
I heard you got rid of your children.

28:57.339 --> 28:58.716
Well done.

28:58.716 --> 29:00.842
Now the field is free, isn't it?

29:00.842 --> 29:03.554
I know you're a bad mother. "

29:03.554 --> 29:06.432
- Hello?
- I received another one.

29:06.432 --> 29:09.476
- Another what?
- Anonymous letter.

29:09.476 --> 29:11.478
Another one? Poor!

29:11.770 --> 29:14.440
- But I meant Facebook.
- Facebook?

29:14.440 --> 29:19.153
- Your Facebook page.
- But there isn't. I do not know how it works.

29:19.153 --> 29:21.531
The matter is very serious.
Do not move, I'll be right away.

29:21.531 --> 29:23.074
Ok, I'll wait for you.

29:26.452 --> 29:28.245
What is this Facebook story?

29:28.245 --> 29:30.581
There will be a page of mine,
but I have nothing to do with it.

29:30.581 --> 29:33.751
There is a page in your name,
even if you did not create it.

29:33.751 --> 29:36.712
And anyone can post something.

29:40.758 --> 29:44.679
- Your password?
- louisepaul222, all lowercase.

29:44.679 --> 29:48.600
- Why "222"?
- I do not know, I did not set it up.

29:50.267 --> 29:55.856
Someone in your family has posted
abominable things about you. Listen.

29:56.399 --> 29:58.900
"She's a disease who destroys
everything around her, she is dangerous.

29:58.900 --> 30:00.903
If you had a person like that in your family,

30:00.903 --> 30:04.156
you would commit them like her mother."
- Turn off that thing.

30:04.741 --> 30:06.158
You're wrong, it's very serious.

30:06.533 --> 30:11.247
Anonymous letters are one thing,
but an attack on social networks is serious.

30:11.247 --> 30:12.582
Really?

30:12.582 --> 30:15.293
People believe more in slander than in truth.

30:15.293 --> 30:17.003
Then it is useless to answer.

30:17.003 --> 30:18.712
Your readers do it for you, they defend you.

30:18.712 --> 30:21.257
- Not everyone, I guess.
- Not everybody.

30:21.715 --> 30:24.844
And then they get angry with each other. Listen.

30:24.844 --> 30:28.222
"Why all this hatred? Read something else."

30:28.222 --> 30:32.101
And the other replies:
"It's shit, people love shit.

30:32.101 --> 30:37.231
She's a media whore.
She would do anything to be in the spotlight.

30:37.231 --> 30:42.654
Look at her partner. She only cares about money.
She would sell her family for money.

30:42.654 --> 30:47.533
And they call that literature ... "
- Turn off that thing, I beg you, stop.

30:50.953 --> 30:55.792
I'm sorry, but it's really too much.
I am destroyed.

30:57.043 --> 30:58.378
I understand you.

31:00.379 --> 31:04.008
Do not worry. I'll take care of everything.

31:08.429 --> 31:10.222
This will help you relax.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.559
What is that?

31:13.142 --> 31:16.604
An anxiolytic, Xanax.
Only half a milligram.

31:21.943 --> 31:23.319
Thank you.

31:24.654 --> 31:27.114
I'll give you another one tonight.

32:05.694 --> 32:08.155
- How are you?
- I'm torn.

32:08.155 --> 32:10.117
How was the night?

32:10.117 --> 32:12.118
Bad, like yesterday.

32:12.118 --> 32:15.538
I woke up at 4:00 am in anguish.

32:15.538 --> 32:17.123
I could not get back to sleep.

32:17.624 --> 32:20.001
Did you take another Xanax as I told you?

32:20.001 --> 32:21.836
I took two.

32:21.836 --> 32:25.507
I was able to sleep between 8.30am and 9.00am.

32:27.842 --> 32:30.345
- louisepaul222, right?
- Yes.

32:34.015 --> 32:36.642
How long have you not checked your inbox?

32:37.685 --> 32:42.315
Good. We will start by replying to your emails.

32:42.815 --> 32:43.733
Then...

32:44.150 --> 32:47.486
To all the proposals, for the editorials...

32:48.238 --> 32:51.073
...to the readings, I will reply that
you are busy with the new book,

32:51.073 --> 32:56.163
that you are flattered that they have chosen you,
but that you need to concentrate now.

32:56.163 --> 32:57.372
Is that OK?

32:59.498 --> 33:02.460
And... I will add a closure like that...

33:02.460 --> 33:06.005
"Do not hesitate to contact me for a next time,
I would be delighted."

33:06.714 --> 33:09.509
What is it, a high school in Tours?

33:11.511 --> 33:13.388
Have you made a commitment for the next week?

33:14.055 --> 33:16.683
There are three classes that work on my book.

33:16.683 --> 33:18.392
- And?

33:18.392 --> 33:23.356
I promised that I would give a talk
on the writting craft.

33:23.356 --> 33:25.900
How is the speech proceeding?

33:26.819 --> 33:30.447
I have some notes, well... some notes.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.533
Some notes...

33:33.533 --> 33:35.952
There are three messages

33:35.952 --> 33:38.413
from the high school librarian.
It seems rather unpleasant.

33:38.413 --> 33:41.123
She says: "Students are happy to meet you.

33:41.123 --> 33:43.085
Could you send me your train times?

33:43.085 --> 33:45.713
As I told you in the previous email,
I need to know them

33:45.713 --> 33:48.465
to organize students and book a room."

33:48.465 --> 33:51.801
Then she begins to be impatient.

33:51.801 --> 33:53.887
She says: "In the absence of a response from you

33:53.887 --> 33:57.265
I would like to remind you that
200 students await you next Thursday 9

33:57.265 --> 33:59.351
for a meeting on the theme 'The Writing Craft'

33:59.351 --> 34:01.436
to which you have agreed to participate.

34:01.436 --> 34:05.190
Thank you. They are studying your books. "

34:05.190 --> 34:06.524
It's really annoying.

34:07.609 --> 34:09.652
I do not know. What are we doing, Delphine?

34:09.652 --> 34:12.989
- We have to answer.
- I will go there.

34:16.409 --> 34:20.121
- Are you sure?
- I have no other choice.

34:36.972 --> 34:38.598
The coffee.

34:40.766 --> 34:44.437
I found some notes for the speech at high school Tours.

34:44.437 --> 34:47.940
- Actually, you had them trashed.
- Really?

34:47.940 --> 34:50.610
They were nothing short of mediocre.
I started again.

34:51.945 --> 34:53.780
Do you want to take a look?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.791
Are you well?

35:05.125 --> 35:07.002
Everything's fine with me.

35:08.128 --> 35:10.297
Save my life.

35:14.593 --> 35:16.803
I'm happy to help.

35:16.803 --> 35:21.308
If it allows you to focus on important things.

35:29.817 --> 35:31.943
I have concerns too.

35:32.819 --> 35:34.237
In reality...

35:35.155 --> 35:37.616
I rented my apartment.

35:37.616 --> 35:41.662
The owner worked abroad
but had to return urgently.

35:41.662 --> 35:43.746
I have to go.

35:48.168 --> 35:52.756
Can you host me for a week or two
until I find something else?

35:53.506 --> 35:56.385
Since the boys' room is free ...

35:58.095 --> 35:59.304
- Of course.

36:03.559 --> 36:05.477
Do you need all these things?

36:05.477 --> 36:09.898
No, but I do not know where to put them.
Basically it's all I have.

36:09.898 --> 36:13.485
And then, there are my documents.
No, those are too heavy.

36:16.905 --> 36:18.866
An elevator would have been convenient.

36:18.866 --> 36:21.826
We tried, but the condominium has not approved it.

36:49.605 --> 36:52.524
You can use the shelves, I also freed the wardrobe.

36:58.864 --> 37:00.908
I fix everything later.

37:18.216 --> 37:21.094
France Culture, for the interview.

37:22.095 --> 37:23.763
Fourth floor.

37:24.932 --> 37:27.600
- Who is it?
- A journalist from France Culture.

37:36.027 --> 37:37.986
You did not tell me anything.

37:37.986 --> 37:39.613
I do not tell you everything.

37:40.198 --> 37:41.824
What do you have to talk about?

37:42.699 --> 37:44.743
Of my first book.

37:44.743 --> 37:46.829
On job anxiety.

37:46.829 --> 37:49.081
Haven't you talked about it enough yet?

37:58.298 --> 38:01.468
- Hi, thanks for the invitation.
- Imagine yourself.

38:01.468 --> 38:04.221
- Damien, the sound engineer.
- Hello.

38:05.138 --> 38:07.391
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

38:10.686 --> 38:12.145
Thank you.

38:12.145 --> 38:15.399
Do you mind if I open the window?
For the noise of the city.

38:15.399 --> 38:18.027
- Go ahead.
- It seems more lively.

38:19.862 --> 38:22.281
Do you know how it works?

38:22.281 --> 38:24.825
Let's talk about a new novel

38:24.825 --> 38:28.997
and insert it into today's society.
Do you remember how it started?

38:29.788 --> 38:32.207
I remember perfectly.

38:32.624 --> 38:34.668
I was on the train.

38:35.252 --> 38:37.130
It was raining.

38:37.421 --> 38:40.466
I was going to work.
It was all very lugubrious.

38:41.425 --> 38:45.138
Was it easy to tackle the theme of work in a novel?

38:45.971 --> 38:48.766
Actually, at first I did not
want to talk about the world of work,

38:48.766 --> 38:51.434
but of urban solitude.

38:51.978 --> 38:55.774
I wanted to describe the characters in everyday life.

38:55.774 --> 38:58.484
Lives destroyed, solitary ...

38:58.484 --> 39:01.029
Nothing very romantic.

39:01.029 --> 39:03.238
What was gloomy about your work?

39:04.782 --> 39:07.744
I was in charge of social relations in a company.

39:07.744 --> 39:12.040
It consisted of understanding social relationships ...

39:12.040 --> 39:15.501
find the solution in conflict situations.

39:15.501 --> 39:19.213
I do not think you want to know more.

39:22.465 --> 39:25.761
Thanks again for inviting us.

39:25.761 --> 39:30.015
The program will air on 21.
I will send you a message for confirmation.

39:30.015 --> 39:32.310
- All right. Thank you, goodbye.
- Thank you, goodbye.

39:32.310 --> 39:34.019
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.232
Then?

39:38.942 --> 39:40.693
Have you made a new friend?

39:42.695 --> 39:45.280
All this staging to see you reduced like this.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.783
"Back to fiction"?

39:47.783 --> 39:51.162
What do they care?
Who is she to be able to give judgments?

39:51.162 --> 39:54.415
Are you serious?
Are you having a jealousy crisis?

39:54.415 --> 39:57.836
Forgive me, but to see you waste time makes me angry.

39:57.836 --> 39:59.753
That woman is dragging you towards the bottom.

39:59.753 --> 40:02.215
Only I know who you are and what you are able to write.

40:02.215 --> 40:03.674
Only you?

40:04.091 --> 40:07.720
Can't you see I'm terrified?
And are at a standstill?

40:07.720 --> 40:09.973
You piss me off with the story of the hidden book.

40:09.973 --> 40:12.224
There is no hidden book. There is nothing behind the curtain.

40:12.224 --> 40:16.187
No taboos, no treasure, no secrets!
There is nothing!

40:16.187 --> 40:18.606
Look at me, I'm transparent!

40:30.951 --> 40:35.749
"This answering machine knows how to make you talk."

40:36.290 --> 40:39.127
Paul, honey, what's up?

40:39.544 --> 40:41.129
Do not you love your mother anymore?

40:41.795 --> 40:44.173
Call me once in a while, I miss you so much.

40:44.966 --> 40:48.302
If you see your sister, tell her I'd like to hear from her.

40:49.012 --> 40:52.223
A kiss. Take care of yourself.

41:00.356 --> 41:03.567
- Mom?
- Yes, it's mom.

41:03.567 --> 41:07.363
- I wanted to remind you that I exist.
- Stop that.

41:07.363 --> 41:10.450
- Before you called me every day.
- Work, mom.

41:10.450 --> 41:13.703
I'm so happy, I did my first solo.

41:13.703 --> 41:17.957
- What does that mean?
- That the instructor makes you fly alone.

41:18.374 --> 41:22.170
- Under his control?
- No, he's not in the plane.

41:22.170 --> 41:26.716
I was alone. It was the most incredible thing I did.

41:26.716 --> 41:29.511
You can not imagine it. I will tell you.

41:29.511 --> 41:31.262
Yes, you will tell it to me.

41:32.180 --> 41:34.015
We'll talk.

41:34.015 --> 41:35.349
Kisses.

41:46.735 --> 41:48.988
- You're back.
- You're going out?

41:48.988 --> 41:50.489
Yes, I'm late.

41:50.489 --> 41:53.910
But I'm making progress. You left a mess!

41:53.910 --> 41:57.914
"It's been a long time since you've written any more?
- I do not know. It happened gradually.

41:58.873 --> 42:01.334
Do not worry, we will find a solution.

42:01.334 --> 42:04.754
But you have many requests.
Come translated everywhere. It's incredible.

42:05.421 --> 42:07.382
I told everyone that you're not in Paris.

42:08.257 --> 42:10.676
Could not you say I was not in the mood?

42:10.676 --> 42:14.222
Nobody needs to know what kind of mood you are.

42:44.252 --> 42:45.837
"Begin by selling your mother

42:45.837 --> 42:49.215
and then go out with a TV presenter to do promotion.

42:49.215 --> 42:51.968
Congratulations, you had to do it.

42:51.968 --> 42:57.016
When he leaves you,
I guess you'll write us a book full of crap.

42:57.016 --> 43:01.853
You have caused so much pain and so much damage.
And do you know why?

43:02.771 --> 43:05.440
Because people believe what is written."

43:18.995 --> 43:21.248
It's someone who has hated you for a long time.

43:23.332 --> 43:25.627
It is your book that has enabled all this

43:31.508 --> 43:33.092
It's the last one?

43:34.719 --> 43:35.887
Yes.

43:38.890 --> 43:41.893
"Because people believe what is written."

43:43.812 --> 43:45.229
And they are right!

43:47.524 --> 43:50.401
Why would they be right?
And who are these people?

43:50.401 --> 43:52.862
People can go wrong and say bullshit.

43:52.862 --> 43:54.990
Look around.

43:54.990 --> 43:57.158
All writers use current events.

43:57.158 --> 44:01.245
And why, do you think?
Because it is the only valid source.

44:01.245 --> 44:03.373
You want to go back to fiction for one reason:

44:03.373 --> 44:06.293
you refuse to write your hidden book.

44:06.293 --> 44:08.169
Stop that, with my "hidden book"!

44:08.169 --> 44:09.839
Sorry if I insist.

44:09.839 --> 44:14.343
But I reread the interview. Read it on the Internet.

44:14.343 --> 44:16.928
Maybe I'll write it one day, but not now.

44:16.928 --> 44:19.181
My work took me elsewhere.

44:19.181 --> 44:20.557
Where?

44:22.184 --> 44:24.018
Where did it bring you?

44:28.523 --> 44:31.485
For me, it did not get you anywhere.

46:02.159 --> 46:03.243
What are you doing here?

46:04.244 --> 46:07.247
- I heard you get up.
- So?

46:08.541 --> 46:10.042
So?

46:11.168 --> 46:14.338
If my presence is a burden, tell me and I'll leave.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.466
I'm sorry.

46:17.925 --> 46:19.634
I did not mean that.

46:22.096 --> 46:25.307
Are you okay, Delphine?
- Yes I'm fine.

46:26.016 --> 46:29.519
Then go to sleep,
because tomorrow you leave early for Tours.

46:29.811 --> 46:31.439
No, I'm not fine.

46:32.314 --> 46:35.776
I know it will be a drama,
but I can not go there.

46:35.943 --> 46:37.902
I do not have the strength.

46:37.902 --> 46:40.698
- Do you want me to go in your place?
- Are you kidding?

46:40.698 --> 46:42.407
Not at all.

46:42.741 --> 46:46.286
- Would you pretend to be me?
- Why not?

46:46.829 --> 46:49.414
Despite all my photos on Google?

46:49.414 --> 46:52.501
There are many, with many different expressions.

46:53.502 --> 46:58.133
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

47:11.937 --> 47:13.313
Wait up.

47:25.993 --> 47:28.120
> Keep. Try this.

47:36.671 --> 47:40.550
I was on the train. It was raining.

47:41.258 --> 47:44.470
I was going to work. It was all very lugubrious.

47:45.220 --> 47:48.474
I was in charge of social relations in a company.

47:48.474 --> 47:53.020
It consisted of understanding social relationships ...

47:53.020 --> 47:56.857
find the solution in conflict situations.

47:57.525 --> 48:00.236
I do not think you want to know more.

48:24.635 --> 48:28.514
- Is not it too early for you?
- No do not worry.

48:28.514 --> 48:32.017
- I was awake. I have good news.
- Which?

48:33.560 --> 48:38.399
James Ellroy accepted a meeting.
His French agent confirmed this.

48:39.066 --> 48:40.776
I am happy for you.

48:43.654 --> 48:48.200
How are you?
I was worried. I did not hear from you.

48:48.200 --> 48:51.412
I left you some messages.

48:51.412 --> 48:52.913
I'm fine.

48:55.332 --> 48:56.835
And nothing else?

48:57.252 --> 48:58.628
I'm fine.

49:00.045 --> 49:03.549
I understand that you need to be alone, to protect your work

49:03.549 --> 49:06.594
and that you can not talk to me about certain things.

49:07.302 --> 49:09.055
But that's too much.

49:10.598 --> 49:12.183
It's dangerous.

49:14.268 --> 49:17.647
- Let me help you.
- Come back, then.

49:17.647 --> 49:19.606
You know I can not.

49:19.606 --> 49:23.360
It is impossible to communicate.
You are locked.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.946
We're not at war, I'm not your enemy.

49:28.949 --> 49:33.538
Sometimes, I wonder if someone has taken possession of you.

49:33.954 --> 49:35.290
Delphine!

49:39.669 --> 49:41.837
- Oriane.
- How are you?

49:41.837 --> 49:47.635
- Sorry, I had my head in the clouds.
- Yes I know. You are immersed in writing.

49:47.635 --> 49:49.804
- Do you live in the area?
- No, in Montreuil.

49:49.804 --> 49:54.726
We went to the pediatrician and
promised her a ride on the carousel.

49:54.726 --> 49:58.104
- Mom, can I go?
- Yes honey. Go, now I'm coming.

49:58.104 --> 50:00.773
Do not go alone. Watch only.

50:01.607 --> 50:04.402
I followed your instructions.

50:04.569 --> 50:09.616
No interview, no autograph, no trip, I blocked everything.

50:09.616 --> 50:12.117
- Thanks, but ...
- I was impeccable.

50:12.117 --> 50:14.287
After your email, you have not heard from me.

50:14.287 --> 50:17.290
- I can not wait to read your book.
- Which e-mail?

50:18.291 --> 50:22.920
You had written to tell us
to leave you alone as you finished the book.

50:23.546 --> 50:25.506
It's true, I'm sorry.

50:25.506 --> 50:28.383
I'm really focused right now,

50:28.383 --> 50:32.262
I have to stay a little alone.
But I will see again soon.

50:33.306 --> 50:36.727
- I have to go. Good luck.
- Thank you.

50:42.440 --> 50:43.733
Then?

50:44.484 --> 50:46.277
A total disaster.

50:47.277 --> 50:48.989
They unmasked me.

50:48.989 --> 50:52.575
The cops arrived and they accused me of identity theft.

50:53.076 --> 50:55.579
And now, I'm on probation.

50:55.579 --> 50:57.288
Come on, stop joking.

50:57.288 --> 51:01.084
It went very well. They did not suspect anything.

51:06.589 --> 51:10.468
Think about it, we're interchangeable.

51:10.718 --> 51:14.597
I can do it again when you want.
I'm sure it works with your friends too.

51:17.267 --> 51:19.602
I'm ready to prove it to you.

52:23.542 --> 52:26.836
- Is it your old diary?
- Have you peeked in my things?

52:26.836 --> 52:28.839
No, it was there.

52:29.297 --> 52:31.425
You were lucky to have written it.

52:31.425 --> 52:34.302
I started at 12 and I quit when I had my children.

52:34.302 --> 52:39.391
- 15 years of memories, stories and portraits ...
- And teenage rants.

52:39.391 --> 52:42.435
- They are your memories.
- Not of my best years.

52:42.435 --> 52:45.646
Why do you look for something else
when you already have this?

52:45.646 --> 52:48.650
- I'm not looking for anything.
- You must face reality.

52:48.650 --> 52:51.403
That's enough! I can not stand it anymore.

52:51.403 --> 52:54.323
Stop bothering me. Nobody cares about this.

52:54.323 --> 52:57.575
- To your readers, yes.
- It only matters to me.

52:57.575 --> 53:02.498
There is no perspective.
At best, it's boring, at worst, distressing.

53:02.498 --> 53:05.541
Building a perspective is a form of fiction.

53:05.541 --> 53:06.668
So why wait?

53:06.668 --> 53:09.838
- To do what?
- What you're talking about!

53:38.199 --> 53:40.202
I'm sorry for yesterday.

53:40.952 --> 53:43.288
I had received bad news.

53:44.456 --> 53:48.377
I had to write Depardieu's autobiography.
Do you want some?

53:50.461 --> 53:55.926
I've never been comfortable with men,
but Depardieu intrigued me.

53:55.926 --> 53:58.261
Yes, it's in another dimension.

53:58.261 --> 54:02.057
Just before signing, I knew he had met someone else.

54:02.057 --> 54:04.226
A man, obviously.

54:04.226 --> 54:06.812
And the book was taken from under my nose.

54:09.022 --> 54:11.150
I felt betrayed.

54:11.942 --> 54:16.238
On the other hand, I understand,
male solidarity and the rest.

54:24.663 --> 54:27.208
- Who is it?
- François.

54:28.459 --> 54:32.588
He will not be coming back for now.
He had to accept the third season.

54:34.006 --> 54:35.841
Maybe you need it.

54:36.967 --> 54:39.803
- About what?
- A little bit of distance.

54:42.223 --> 54:43.807
You are fragile.

54:44.933 --> 54:50.606
He's certainly your companion,
but it always hosts and rewards other writers.

54:50.606 --> 54:54.193
I am not jealous. Not that way, anyway.

54:54.860 --> 54:56.988
One that crosses the Atlantic

54:56.988 --> 55:00.992
to meet writers whom he considers
more interesting than the French ones.

55:00.992 --> 55:02.868
Or am I wrong?

55:02.868 --> 55:06.913
No. It's partly true, but I do not think ...

55:06.913 --> 55:10.167
It will not help you find your safety again

55:11.543 --> 55:15.005
I am honored that you make an exception.

55:15.005 --> 55:16.924
What you mean?

55:17.966 --> 55:22.137
- Your email. Did you see Oriane?
- I do not remember writing it.

55:22.137 --> 55:24.348
I did not invent it.

55:31.188 --> 55:35.484
"Dear everyone, as you know, I have writer's block.

55:35.484 --> 55:37.694
This failure leaves me disoriented.

55:38.069 --> 55:41.865
Please do not contact me and do not send me invitations.

55:41.865 --> 55:46.621
I won't be giving any news while writing the book.
Thanks for understanding."

55:47.329 --> 55:49.122
You wrote it, right?

55:49.956 --> 55:52.751
My mind is in turmoil right now.

55:58.049 --> 55:59.425
Thank you.

56:15.149 --> 56:17.151
I was starting to worry.

56:18.027 --> 56:23.282
I made tea. I got you some Bourge Rouge
from Mariage Frères and some macarons.

56:23.282 --> 56:27.328
- I have to tell you something.
- No, I have to tell you something!

56:27.328 --> 56:31.207
You wrote to my friends asking them not to contact me.

56:31.207 --> 56:32.667
Of course.

56:33.167 --> 56:36.212
I did it to help you focus.

56:36.212 --> 56:40.091
You will not be exaggerating?
You should have asked me.

56:40.091 --> 56:43.093
I'm here. Is that not sufficient?

56:43.093 --> 56:47.264
- I can not believe.
- You need peace and solitude for the book.

56:47.264 --> 56:48.600
Which book?

56:48.600 --> 56:51.184
The hidden story that you owe to your readers.

56:51.184 --> 56:52.937
Listen to me.

56:52.937 --> 56:57.191
I never wrote to please anyone and I will not start now.

56:57.608 --> 57:01.695
You are responsible for the love you have aroused.

57:02.113 --> 57:05.282
And what the hell do you care?
Stay out of it.

57:05.282 --> 57:09.453
Do not tell me what to write!
Who do you think you are?

57:18.212 --> 57:22.300
I found a hotel.
They will come and get my bags later.

57:22.300 --> 57:26.012
- No.
- I see that my presence is a burden.

57:26.012 --> 57:30.433
I was hoping to help you regain security.
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

58:04.384 --> 58:06.510
- Are you alright?
- I hurt myself.

58:06.510 --> 58:12.684
Do not move. Stay still.
I'll be right back, do not move.

58:24.070 --> 58:25.529
Delphine!

58:45.925 --> 58:50.597
"Fracture spino-tubérositaire"
(tibial spine fracture)

58:51.889 --> 58:53.349
Congratulations.

58:54.851 --> 58:56.728
It could have been worse.

58:57.103 --> 59:01.065
When I saw you... I was scared.

59:08.906 --> 59:12.243
Four weeks like this ... who can make it?

59:13.911 --> 59:17.207
Why do not you move in François'?
It would be easier.

59:17.207 --> 59:19.917
He's abroad, I can not go alone.

59:22.211 --> 59:24.255
I need to rest.

59:28.843 --> 59:31.178
I'm exhausted.

59:31.178 --> 59:34.223
- If you want, I'll come with you.
- Are you sure?

59:34.932 --> 59:37.644
Yes, I have to write too. It's perfect.

59:39.186 --> 59:43.901
I will need a few things. Clothes, bath products ...

59:44.817 --> 59:46.778
I'll take them.

59:49.239 --> 59:51.115
Give me the keys.

01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:08.133
- I'm happy to see you up and about.
- In a manner of speaking.

01:00:09.008 --> 01:00:11.969
- I have your shopping.
- Do not worry. Thank you.

01:00:11.969 --> 01:00:14.472
The strawberries have gone bad.

01:00:14.472 --> 01:00:18.977
- If you need me ...
- No, I'm fine. Thanks for your help.

01:00:18.977 --> 01:00:21.604
- Nothing. Come on!
- Thank you.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:26.944
What a shitty weather.

01:00:32.281 --> 01:00:34.701
Like when I met my husband.

01:00:36.077 --> 01:00:38.538
I was stuck in traffic.

01:00:39.164 --> 01:00:43.376
Someone knocked on my window.
A handsome guy in a leather jacket.

01:00:43.376 --> 01:00:46.046
I unlocked the door and he went upstairs.

01:00:46.713 --> 01:00:48.255
What did he look like?

01:00:49.632 --> 01:00:53.803
Tall, robust, with a beard. Very virile.

01:00:54.596 --> 01:00:59.642
I liked his smell.
A mixture of wet skin and tobacco.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.562
I would have felt uncomfortable.

01:01:02.562 --> 01:01:05.398
I wanted Jean as soon as he entered.

01:01:06.358 --> 01:01:10.278
I approached an alley and went to a shabby hotel

01:01:10.278 --> 01:01:13.156
and we spent a night of passion.

01:01:13.156 --> 01:01:14.866
How old were you?

01:01:15.658 --> 01:01:18.411
19 and him 28.

01:01:21.081 --> 01:01:26.753
He was a mountain guide, then.
He had even climbed K2, but...

01:01:28.296 --> 01:01:31.383
he had an accident and was forced to stop.

01:01:32.467 --> 01:01:35.763
Later he worked as a courier, barman...

01:01:35.763 --> 01:01:39.432
He also wanted to be an antique dealer.
He would have done everything.

01:02:01.664 --> 01:02:03.415
It's all clear now.

01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:07.377
The way we met and how she came into my life.

01:02:07.377 --> 01:02:10.798
It is obvious. It's about Elle I have to write.

01:02:11.756 --> 01:02:14.592
But you talked to her about it.

01:02:14.592 --> 01:02:16.428
God, no.

01:02:16.428 --> 01:02:20.432
If I do, she will not talk to me anymore.
I will let her come to me.

01:02:20.432 --> 01:02:23.518
Be careful. You told me she was dangerous.

01:02:25.813 --> 01:02:27.772
Of course, I will be cautious.

01:02:27.772 --> 01:02:32.361
I want to write about real life.
Hers looks like a novel, not mine.

01:02:33.862 --> 01:02:38.783
But you need her to open up, you said she's very private.

01:02:39.409 --> 01:02:43.914
Yes, she will come with me.
I'll be smart. I call you.

01:02:47.585 --> 01:02:50.087
- Will you bring me a coffee, please?
- Ok.

01:02:50.087 --> 01:02:51.964
- And an M&M's.

01:03:01.556 --> 01:03:04.309
- Are you Delphine Dayrieux?
- Yes.

01:03:04.768 --> 01:03:09.022
I am the librarian of the Balzac high school in Tours.

01:03:10.065 --> 01:03:11.484
Yes sure.

01:03:12.818 --> 01:03:17.655
- We felt bad for your visit.
- Yes, I recognize you.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:23.829
No, I don't think I've ever had the
pleasure of meeting you, Mrs. Dayrieux.

01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:26.582
But when I came to school...

01:03:29.835 --> 01:03:32.170
You have some nerve!

01:03:33.463 --> 01:03:38.010
- Do you not remember?
- No, I do not remember, Mrs. Dayrieux.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:41.139
Because you never came to visit us.

01:03:44.432 --> 01:03:46.560
I'll allow myself to refresh your memory,

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.024
who did not even have the courtesy
to warn us or apologize to us.

01:03:52.024 --> 01:03:58.196
We will no longer encourage our students
to take an interest in your writings.

01:03:58.196 --> 01:04:00.115
I wish you a good evening.

01:04:08.582 --> 01:04:12.503
- What did she want?
- Nothing. Only an admirer.

01:04:30.562 --> 01:04:33.732
We had to spend a month in an alpine shelter.

01:04:33.732 --> 01:04:35.484
Then he changed his mind.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.153
It was my fault.

01:04:38.737 --> 01:04:42.700
- Your fault?
- He was taking care of me, but I insisted.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:43.867
It's my fault.

01:04:44.868 --> 01:04:48.330
- We are not responsible for others.
- No?

01:04:49.581 --> 01:04:51.375
I'm not so sure.

01:04:54.837 --> 01:04:57.715
One day, a storm broke out.

01:04:57.715 --> 01:05:00.926
- Were you alone at the shelter?
- Alone, yes.

01:05:01.635 --> 01:05:05.723
Bored to death. We read a lot, we stopped having sex.

01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:09.810
The wind that blows incessantly for days makes you crazy.

01:05:10.561 --> 01:05:14.107
Finally it subsided and I went out to get some air.

01:05:14.607 --> 01:05:16.608
Alone?

01:05:16.608 --> 01:05:18.236
He did not want to come.

01:05:18.986 --> 01:05:22.448
I was walking in the woods when ...

01:05:22.448 --> 01:05:24.783
I heard a shot behind me.

01:05:25.451 --> 01:05:27.870
I went back to the shelter and there ...

01:05:29.622 --> 01:05:31.624
I found his body.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:36.004
His head had exploded. There was blood everywhere.

01:05:38.631 --> 01:05:40.633
It's terrible.

01:05:40.633 --> 01:05:42.385
It's been a long time.

01:06:02.112 --> 01:06:04.740
I was alone after my mother's death.

01:06:06.826 --> 01:06:10.120
- Then there was the fire.
- Really?

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.998
The whole house went up in smoke.

01:06:14.249 --> 01:06:17.920
Fortunately, I had a friend. My best friend, Kiki.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.339
Kiki? You never talked about her.

01:06:20.339 --> 01:06:24.051
- No?
- You said you did not have any friends.

01:06:27.138 --> 01:06:28.681
In reality...

01:06:29.389 --> 01:06:33.018
Kiki does not exist. I had an imaginary friend.

01:06:33.645 --> 01:06:36.730
Kiki was a pretty girl with red hair.

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:39.775
I dreamed of running away with her.

01:06:41.194 --> 01:06:43.571
Where nobody could have bothered us.

01:08:00.481 --> 01:08:01.983
- Yes?

01:08:05.487 --> 01:08:07.113
Already standing?

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.574
- I did not hear you.
- I've been awake for a long time.

01:08:11.659 --> 01:08:13.745
- All right?
- Yes.

01:08:22.586 --> 01:08:25.298
Good. I let you work.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:40.647
We are here. It's going as I hoped.

01:08:40.647 --> 01:08:42.481
- She's biting it.
- She is?

01:08:43.357 --> 01:08:47.404
She thinks I'm focused on myself, she confides in me.

01:08:48.822 --> 01:08:52.867
It does not follow a temporal order.
They are fragmented episodes.

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:55.662
I have to connect them together.

01:08:55.662 --> 01:08:59.082
I would like to register it, but it is too risky.

01:08:59.916 --> 01:09:01.542
- I have to hang up.

01:09:03.837 --> 01:09:07.299
- What do you want for lunch?
- What you want.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.557
It's a little too early to say, but...

01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:18.435
I'm taking notes for a new book.

01:09:18.852 --> 01:09:22.897
- Really?
- A very personal thing.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:26.193
A risky, very private thing.

01:09:26.443 --> 01:09:29.362
- Do you mean an autobiography?
- Yes.

01:09:31.113 --> 01:09:34.158
I can not say anything else, it's not sure yet.

01:09:34.658 --> 01:09:36.868
A kind of confession.

01:09:38.537 --> 01:09:43.126
I can not even use the computer
or take notes on paper, but ...

01:09:43.126 --> 01:09:45.504
the recorder is ideal.

01:09:45.504 --> 01:09:48.631
- Is it your hidden book?
- Yes.

01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:50.550
It will be difficult.

01:09:51.091 --> 01:09:53.095
But you were right.

01:09:53.095 --> 01:09:55.013
It's time to face it.

01:10:07.358 --> 01:10:09.653
I never told you, but ...

01:10:09.653 --> 01:10:12.239
my mother also committed suicide.

01:10:15.825 --> 01:10:18.494
I found her on the floor in the corridor.

01:10:20.205 --> 01:10:22.999
With her yellow flower dress thay I liked.

01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:26.085
I was 4 years old.

01:10:26.878 --> 01:10:31.008
I curled up next to her and stayed there like that...
For hours.

01:11:31.985 --> 01:11:33.903
It's February 7th.

01:11:34.488 --> 01:11:37.991
I'm starting to write again. Openly, if necessary.

01:11:39.117 --> 01:11:42.996
She opened up yesterday. She told me some of her memories.

01:11:42.996 --> 01:11:44.623
It's a start.

01:11:45.915 --> 01:11:49.919
I have to win her trust. I know how to do it.

01:11:50.962 --> 01:11:55.092
She had an imaginary friend. Kiki.
She wanted to run away with her.

01:11:55.092 --> 01:11:57.177
Kiki told her that they would have a new life.

01:11:57.177 --> 01:11:59.638
The whole house burned, went up in smoke.

01:11:59.638 --> 01:12:01.973
Tall, robust, with a beard, virile.

01:12:01.973 --> 01:12:06.435
They were alone in the shelter.
She found him with his head exploded.

01:12:14.278 --> 01:12:16.738
Can not you stay still for two minutes?

01:12:21.743 --> 01:12:23.453
Now, however, you're good.

01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:26.248
Or I'll break your other knee too.

01:13:23.889 --> 01:13:26.057
ELLE (her)

01:13:26.057 --> 01:13:28.435
Tell me who you are writing about.

01:13:28.435 --> 01:13:31.481
No. The secrecy clause is longer than the contract.

01:13:31.481 --> 01:13:33.690
- I will not tell anyone.
- You'll let it escape.

01:13:34.233 --> 01:13:37.944
Who is it? An actress? A politician?

01:13:38.779 --> 01:13:43.826
At least tell me if I'm close. A singer? An athlete?

01:13:43.826 --> 01:13:46.161
Catherine Deneuve? Kim Kardashian?

01:13:46.579 --> 01:13:47.579
Rocco Siffredi.

01:13:55.462 --> 01:13:57.256
Imaginary friend Kiki

01:14:13.939 --> 01:14:15.732
We close them, no?

01:14:35.836 --> 01:14:37.880
Mice!

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.300
- A mouse. There are mice here!
- I get it.

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:45.220
Did you see a mouse?

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.765
I saw two running towards the basement.

01:14:47.765 --> 01:14:50.142
Calm down, it's nothing serious.

01:14:51.311 --> 01:14:54.604
Come on. Sit down. Take it easy.

01:14:56.941 --> 01:15:00.861
We will get rid of it, we will buy traps.
It's nothing.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.873
Can you close the basement hatch?

01:15:12.873 --> 01:15:14.459
I left it open.

01:15:19.213 --> 01:15:21.548
Pass me the crutches, please.

01:16:12.017 --> 01:16:14.644
I had to go to the city to the market.

01:16:15.645 --> 01:16:19.983
Traps, rat poison. I took everything.
We will exterminate them.

01:16:20.941 --> 01:16:23.361
The shop assistant was very kind, it's just...

01:16:23.861 --> 01:16:25.738
Just, what?

01:16:27.198 --> 01:16:30.409
You will have to do it.
I will not go down there.

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:33.996
Sorry for everything... it's a real phobia.

01:17:56.079 --> 01:18:00.083
- I did not come back empty-handed.
- I can't see that!

01:18:16.932 --> 01:18:21.479
Usually, I like lemon, but your sauce is delicious.

01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:24.607
It's nothing like that, it's a simple American sauce.

01:18:24.607 --> 01:18:27.652
- I could not prepare it.
- Do you want more?

01:18:27.652 --> 01:18:31.739
No, thank you, I'm full.
I've already eaten a second serving.

01:18:31.739 --> 01:18:34.492
- I'll open another one.
- At this point ...

01:18:37.538 --> 01:18:41.583
My father... he was draining three a day.

01:18:45.796 --> 01:18:48.549
When my mother died, I stayed alone with him.

01:18:48.549 --> 01:18:51.259
It scared me, he was violent. He...

01:18:52.344 --> 01:18:53.428
He...

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:57.265
All my flaws come from him.

01:18:58.599 --> 01:19:00.644
He locked me up, literally.

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:04.773
When he died in the fire, I finally felt free.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.194
- What happened?

01:19:09.569 --> 01:19:11.822
It seems it was an arson.

01:19:13.073 --> 01:19:16.367
- Who set him up?
- They never took the manager.

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:21.581
- Do you have any ideas?

01:19:24.584 --> 01:19:26.586
In my opinion, it was Kiki.

01:20:31.567 --> 01:20:33.779
I'm preparing fish soup for dinner.

01:20:34.695 --> 01:20:37.240
Soup? Great.

01:20:37.949 --> 01:20:39.951
You said you like it so much.

01:21:46.893 --> 01:21:49.605
You're burning, we have to bring down the fever.

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.394
Hello?

01:23:13.147 --> 01:23:16.442
No, it's not Delphine, I'm a friend of hers, Elle.
We do not know each other.

01:23:18.194 --> 01:23:19.611
Where is it, excuse me?

01:23:19.986 --> 01:23:21.613
I'm hearing you very badly.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:25.284
In Wyoming?

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:30.122
No, she's in bed. She has food poisoning.

01:23:31.457 --> 01:23:34.210
Nothing serious, she will call you back.

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:42.008
"I'm starting to write again, openly, if necessary.

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:46.638
She opened up yesterday. She told me some of her memories.

01:23:46.638 --> 01:23:48.390
It's a start ...

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:53.895
I have to win her trust. I know how to do it.

01:23:55.982 --> 01:23:58.442
She told me about a fire ...

01:23:58.985 --> 01:24:00.902
but she does not want to tell me anything else.

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:04.115
I'll get it out of her.

01:24:04.115 --> 01:24:06.784
She said that the mother also... "

01:24:29.307 --> 01:24:32.393
- I made you a broth.
- I'm not hungry.

01:24:32.393 --> 01:24:36.522
- My stomach hurts.
- You will not heal, if you do not eat something.

01:24:39.775 --> 01:24:41.277
I can't.

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:50.786
Try again.

01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:52.789
- Please...
- Try it.

01:24:59.962 --> 01:25:01.756
Please, please...

01:25:01.756 --> 01:25:05.092
That's enough. Leave it there.

01:25:05.968 --> 01:25:07.637
I'll eat it later.

01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:12.517
I'm sorry for making you a broth.

01:26:06.613 --> 01:26:08.530
I made you some hot chocolate.

01:26:10.992 --> 01:26:13.536
I can not call François back.

01:26:13.536 --> 01:26:16.288
If it's important, he'll call him back.

01:26:19.166 --> 01:26:22.419
- I want to inform my children.
- It's done.

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.260
You must drink. You did not eat anything.

01:26:32.305 --> 01:26:33.931
Be reasonable.

01:26:34.515 --> 01:26:36.226
Force yourself.

01:26:38.811 --> 01:26:41.272
Enough with the whims, drink.

01:26:46.652 --> 01:26:48.530
Come on, drink!

01:28:02.019 --> 01:28:03.270
Delphine!

01:28:09.361 --> 01:28:11.279
- Delphine!
- Yes.

01:28:11.279 --> 01:28:13.281
- It's Raymond!
- Yes.

01:28:19.079 --> 01:28:20.955
- Delphine!

01:28:20.955 --> 01:28:22.958
- I'm here.

01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:24.459
Yes.

01:32:20.196 --> 01:32:22.615
Guys! Guys...

01:32:22.615 --> 01:32:24.200
Come and see.

01:32:35.043 --> 01:32:36.420
Hey!

01:32:48.391 --> 01:32:50.392
You frightened me.

01:32:55.064 --> 01:32:58.025
Explain to me. Does anything have to do with me?
Is it my fault?

01:32:58.609 --> 01:32:59.985
Is it because of all my travels?

01:33:01.529 --> 01:33:03.656
I took the first flight.

01:33:05.032 --> 01:33:06.409
You were lucky.

01:33:06.409 --> 01:33:08.201
They found you in time.

01:33:10.288 --> 01:33:12.665
Why did you want to kill yourself?

01:33:15.001 --> 01:33:16.960
I did not want to do it.

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:20.881
The analyzes show a cocktail
of sleeping pills and thallium sulfate.

01:33:21.632 --> 01:33:23.717
Basically, rat poison.

01:33:26.179 --> 01:33:28.055
Does this mean anything to you?

01:33:29.307 --> 01:33:32.267
But do you remember talking to her on the phone?

01:33:32.852 --> 01:33:34.853
Did not it seem strange to you that she answered?

01:33:34.853 --> 01:33:39.232
Delphine, you must believe me.
I've never talked to Elle, do you understand?

01:33:39.232 --> 01:33:41.986
- I understand.
- Never, it never happened.

01:33:41.986 --> 01:33:42.945
Ok.

01:33:42.945 --> 01:33:47.240
I kept calling, but the phone was off.
Off, get it?

01:33:47.908 --> 01:33:50.078
- So I called Raymond.
- Raymond?

01:33:51.203 --> 01:33:53.039
Raymond, the neighbor.

01:33:53.706 --> 01:33:56.960
He knocked on all the doors and windows.

01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:00.379
- Was it Raymond?
- Why didn't you answer?

01:34:00.379 --> 01:34:03.800
- Because she had poisoned me!
- All right.

01:34:04.342 --> 01:34:06.469
All right, don't believe me.

01:34:06.969 --> 01:34:08.262
I believe you.

01:34:09.097 --> 01:34:12.058
Sorry if I made you wait. Come.

01:34:12.976 --> 01:34:14.602
Come in and take a seat.

01:34:16.729 --> 01:34:18.773
I am enthusiastic!

01:34:18.773 --> 01:34:21.900
It is provocative, captivating.
Your best job ever!

01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:25.904
Karina, I haven't written for three years.
I did not send you any manuscript.

01:34:25.904 --> 01:34:29.867
- But I received the manuscript.
- Someone else wrote it. Elle!

01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:40.219
"A work of fiction that will make you dizzy ..."

01:34:40.384 --> 01:34:43.222
Based on a True Story (after a true story)

01:34:46.801 --> 01:34:50.930
I'm so happy to meet you.
I'm really impressed.

01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:57.103
You're a part of my life.
I love your work and this last book is...

01:34:57.103 --> 01:35:00.105
- Who is it for?
- For me, Delphine.

01:35:00.899 --> 01:35:02.733
We have the same name.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.448
I can not wait to read the next one.

01:35:12.326 --> 01:35:14.453
Hello, Mrs. Dayrieux ...

01:35:39.896 --> 01:35:41.647
To Elle.
