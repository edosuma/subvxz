PENN: <i>From the Penn &amp; Teller Theater</i>
<i>in Las Vegas, Nevada,</i>

00:26.867 --> 00:29.367
<i>here's our host, Jonathan Ross.</i>

00:32.366 --> 00:35.067
Thank you very much.
You're so kind. Thank you.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.633
Thank you very much indeed,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.700
Thank you.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.400
Hello and welcome
to <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us.</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:43.533
The premise here is simple.
Illusionists try to fool

00:43.600 --> 00:46.100
two men who have been performing
in Vegas for so long

00:46.167 --> 00:48.167
that even Elvis might call them the kings.

00:48.267 --> 00:50.933
Here they are, ladies and gentlemen,
go crazy for Penn and Teller.

00:51.433 --> 00:53.433
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

00:57.633 --> 00:59.767
Teller, fabulous to see you.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.600
-Penn, it's wonderful seeing you again.
-Mr. Ross, sir.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.000
Of course. Here we are.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.867
Please take your seats.
We can start the show.

01:07.933 --> 01:09.467
It's Penn and Teller,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.933
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

01:13.300 --> 01:16.667
Now, please remember.
All of our acts have flown here to Vegas

01:16.733 --> 01:20.400
hoping to get lucky. And by lucky
I mean to fool Penn and Teller

01:20.467 --> 01:22.733
and win an all-expense-paid trip
to return here to Vegas

01:22.800 --> 01:26.033
and perform for them in their long-running
magic extravaganza.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.867
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's get started.

01:27.933 --> 01:29.533
Let's meet our first magician.

01:34.467 --> 01:36.733
<i>I'm Bill Cook.</i>
<i>I'm from Chicago, Illinois.</i>

01:36.800 --> 01:39.933
<i>In school I studied Foley,</i>
<i>which is, you make sound effects.</i>

01:40.000 --> 01:41.067
It's so cool.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.967
<i>Walking down the streets is one</i>
<i>of my favorite things to do</i>

01:43.033 --> 01:45.833
<i>because when you start to focus</i>
<i>on sound effects and noise,</i>

01:45.900 --> 01:47.333
you listen to everything.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.167
-(BUZZING)
<i>-And it all depends on what you focus on.</i>

01:49.333 --> 01:50.667
-(SPRINKLERS RUNNING)
-(SLOT MACHINE CHIMES)

01:51.633 --> 01:53.600
<i>My dad had lots of quotes</i>
<i>for people to live by,</i>

01:53.667 --> 01:55.367
<i>and three of them really stuck out to me.</i>

01:55.433 --> 01:57.967
"To be early is to be on time,
be at the right place at the right time,

01:58.267 --> 02:00.300
<i>"and aim high and shoot for the moon</i>

02:00.400 --> 02:02.600
"because, even if you miss,
you'll land among the stars."

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
<i>So for this show,</i>
<i>I'll be waiting for my performance</i>

02:06.067 --> 02:08.699
<i>with my equipment ready to perform</i>
<i>for Penn and Teller.</i>

02:09.032 --> 02:10.866
-Drop the mic. (LAUGHS)
-(MICROPHONE DROPS)

02:13.167 --> 02:15.933
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

02:16.833 --> 02:19.400
Our next performer is a Chicago guy.

02:19.467 --> 02:22.467
Now traditionally the phrase
"Chicago magic trick"

02:22.533 --> 02:24.333
refers to making someone
disappear for the mob,

02:24.400 --> 02:27.333
but tonight we're all safe,
as a more literal translation

02:27.400 --> 02:30.467
is on display. Will you please welcome
Mr. Bill Cook.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.633
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

02:34.600 --> 02:35.600
COOK: Wow.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.867
Wow, wow, wow.

02:41.433 --> 02:42.800
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Bill Cook.

02:42.867 --> 02:46.833
I come all the way from Chicago,
and it is a supreme honor to be here.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.867
Folks, I do need the assistance
of someone in the audience.

02:49.933 --> 02:53.000
There's a lovely lady about
halfway up in the pink shirt.

02:53.067 --> 02:55.267
-Hi, my dear. What's your name?
-Barbara.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.067
Barbara, would you join me onstage?
Everyone, give Barbara

02:57.133 --> 02:59.133
a huge round of applause
as she comes up to help me onstage.

03:02.233 --> 03:04.133
Barbara, thank you so much.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.733
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

03:07.733 --> 03:10.400
Barbara, I have one of these.

03:10.467 --> 03:14.133
Do you know what this is?
It's totally okay to say you do not.

03:15.700 --> 03:20.000
Uh, oh, that's the clasp from
a little clutch bag thing.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.133
-The top of a change...
-Yeah, like a little change purse.

03:23.367 --> 03:24.367
Change holder.

03:24.433 --> 03:25.967
-Okay.
-I don't carry a purse.

03:26.033 --> 03:27.100
-Okay.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

03:28.967 --> 03:30.833
Inside of the holder,
Barbara, is something

03:30.900 --> 03:32.467
very special and unique to my job.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.900
I have an invisible deck of playing cards.

03:38.967 --> 03:41.567
Not what other magicians may
have been using in the past.

03:41.867 --> 03:43.500
-Do you see them?
-Nope.

03:43.567 --> 03:45.033
Sobriety test. Good job.

03:46.867 --> 03:49.233
It's Vegas. You never know.
Barbara, hold out your hand.

03:49.933 --> 03:51.367
Perfect. Now, Barbara,

03:51.433 --> 03:54.300
in a deck of cards, there are four suits,
the spades,

03:54.367 --> 03:56.167
the diamonds, the clubs, and the hearts.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.033
And we need to whittle the deck
down to one suit.

03:58.433 --> 04:01.100
I need you to name a suit.
Spades, diamonds, clubs, or hearts.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.433
-Hearts.
-We'll get rid of everything

04:02.500 --> 04:04.233
but the hearts. Catch.

04:04.300 --> 04:06.067
Souvenirs.

04:06.133 --> 04:07.167
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:07.233 --> 04:09.133
Thank you. You can put your hand down.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.033
Barbara, pick a heart.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.233
Show it to everyone.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.500
-It's, uh, backwards. Turn it around.
-Oh, okay.

04:16.567 --> 04:17.567
Thank you so much, yes.

04:18.233 --> 04:19.367
-COOK: You know...
-Couldn't see.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.233
That's... It's the lights.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.633
Uh, which one is it?

04:23.633 --> 04:24.767
Which heart is it?

04:24.833 --> 04:26.333
-It's the seven.
-Seven of hearts.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.333
Show everyone the seven.
Fold the seven into four pieces.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.100
Quarters, half and half. Perfect. Perfect.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.400
And place it inside of the holder.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.433
-Okay.
-You're so good at this.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.433
Now, Barbara, I have to ask you
a question.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.567
A question you will never be
asked anywhere else in the world.

04:40.933 --> 04:42.300
-Are you ready for this?
-Yes.

04:42.367 --> 04:45.167
It's impolite to ask a lady her age,
so how much do you weigh?

04:45.900 --> 04:47.800
-It's a joke! It's a joke.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:47.867 --> 04:50.300
It's totally a joke.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

04:50.367 --> 04:52.600
Barbara, the cool things about
these holders

04:52.667 --> 04:55.133
is that whatever goes inside
of the holder as invisible...

04:58.300 --> 05:00.600
Comes out of the holder as visible.

05:02.033 --> 05:03.367
(AUDIENCE GASPS)

05:04.067 --> 05:05.300
(LAUGHS)

05:05.367 --> 05:08.333
Now, that would be cool,
because it's any playing card.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.500
But you said which playing card?

05:10.567 --> 05:11.900
Seven of hearts.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.167
And that's amazing.

05:14.533 --> 05:16.000
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

05:19.400 --> 05:21.567
Ladies and gentlemen, Barbara.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.533
Bill Cook, ladies and gentlemen.
Wasn't that fabulous?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.067
-That was tremendous.
-Thank you so much.

05:27.133 --> 05:28.433
That was just great.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.367
Uh, now Penn and Teller,
of course, are going to deliberate.

05:30.433 --> 05:31.467
They're going to talk to each other

05:31.533 --> 05:33.400
and see if they can
figure out how it was done.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.867
-Let me ask you a bit about yourself.
-Sure.

05:34.933 --> 05:35.933
I believe, when you were younger,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.667
you were a king chess player,
is that right?

05:37.733 --> 05:39.033
-I love chess.
-Okay.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.600
Now, does that help you
in the practice of magic,

05:41.667 --> 05:44.367
that kind of focus and that kind of skill?

05:44.433 --> 05:47.133
Man, chess and magic kind
of go hand in hand because you have to be

05:47.200 --> 05:49.200
thinking so much further ahead,

05:49.267 --> 05:51.233
whether it's one move,
three moves, 12 moves.

05:51.300 --> 05:54.533
You really have to be thinking
very far ahead.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.200
And that's how
the chess players measure it.

05:56.267 --> 05:59.033
They call it, if you're 12 moves ahead,
you're 12 deep, is that right?

05:59.100 --> 06:00.533
-Twelve deep, yeah.
-Wow. I was never any good.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.500
I've never been 12 deep in anything,
so congratulations to you on that, sir.

06:03.567 --> 06:06.100
Let's go to Penn first,
and we'll hear from Teller in a minute.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.000
-Wonderful routine, first of all.
-Thank you.

06:09.067 --> 06:12.867
I love people that come out here
and do one trick.

06:12.933 --> 06:15.267
That's the idea. You do a trick.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.433
And it's also great that you
used the phrase "invisible deck",

06:18.500 --> 06:21.667
which we all know is a war-horse,

06:21.733 --> 06:23.500
a magic that we don't want to see...

06:23.567 --> 06:25.967
-Right.
-And your version was beautiful.

06:26.033 --> 06:27.133
-Thank you.
-I loved the whole thing,

06:27.200 --> 06:29.700
the way it was put together.
Uh, I think we have a little

06:29.767 --> 06:32.867
bit of an idea of how you do something.

06:32.933 --> 06:35.267
And if you were writing this up in a book

06:35.333 --> 06:37.267
and I wanted
to figure out how you did it,

06:37.333 --> 06:40.233
I would go to the back.
And I would go through where

06:40.300 --> 06:41.767
all the things
are in alphabetical order...

06:41.833 --> 06:43.367
-Yes.
-And that would help me.

06:43.433 --> 06:45.500
I'll also say that the suit jacket

06:45.567 --> 06:47.100
that you're wearing looks beautiful.

06:47.167 --> 06:48.200
Thank you.

06:48.267 --> 06:51.033
Especially the stage
left side is gorgeous.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.667
-Thank you.
-Beautiful-looking suit.

06:52.733 --> 06:54.133
I will also say, uh,

06:54.200 --> 06:57.667
and I'm not sure about this,
so please don't bust

06:57.733 --> 06:59.600
-our bust if we're way off...
-Sure.

06:59.667 --> 07:03.400
But the woman you picked from
the audience, uh, the card

07:03.467 --> 07:05.400
that she selected, you come to Vegas

07:05.467 --> 07:07.833
to get lucky,
and you kind of did get lucky.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.767
That was a... That was a good
choice on her part.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.300
-Can I be honest?
-Yeah.

07:11.367 --> 07:12.767
Uh, you do get lucky,

07:12.833 --> 07:14.867
but you get lucky
a lot more often than you may think.

07:14.933 --> 07:16.833
Yeah, I know. Of course. Yeah.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.967
ROSS: Can I say something as well?

07:18.033 --> 07:19.900
None of us know what you're talking about.

07:20.633 --> 07:23.933
Just cut us a break and say
something we can hold onto here.

07:24.167 --> 07:27.233
Wonderful, wonderful job.
I don't believe you fooled us,

07:27.300 --> 07:28.633
-but it was just beautiful...
-That's okay.

07:28.700 --> 07:31.633
And so clean. I'm going to tell you that

07:31.700 --> 07:34.067
what we love about someone like you

07:34.133 --> 07:35.667
is when we know how the trick

07:35.733 --> 07:38.967
is done but did not see anything.

07:39.033 --> 07:40.667
-Cool.
-And what you want to do in magic

07:40.733 --> 07:43.567
is not only have it fool you conceptually

07:43.633 --> 07:45.867
but also fool you in the actual moves.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.800
And you had an important move
to do and just done so clean.

07:49.867 --> 07:52.267
And there were no telegraphs,
there was no nothing,

07:52.333 --> 07:54.667
and if we were anybody else, you would
have fooled us.

07:54.733 --> 07:56.433
COOK: Cool. Thank you, guys.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.367
You're very confident,
they know exactly what you were doing

08:01.433 --> 08:02.900
and that you didn't fool them?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.633
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
-Okay, right on it.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.733
-Thanks, guys.
-Nicely done.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.300
Bill, it's a pleasure.
Bill Cook, ladies and gentlemen.

08:07.367 --> 08:08.633
Great job. Well done.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.933
Lovely meeting you too. Mr. Bill Cook.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.233
Okay, let's bring out
our next potential fooler.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.600
I'm Wes Barker, and I'm a stunt magician.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.233
A stunt magician is just
a really cool term I made up

08:22.800 --> 08:24.767
<i>just so I didn't sound like every</i>
<i>other comedy magician.</i>

08:25.467 --> 08:27.867
<i>I used to work on a road crew</i>
<i>filling potholes.</i>

08:28.967 --> 08:31.700
They eventually offered me
a promotion, and I just had this

08:31.767 --> 08:34.033
<i>flash of 30 years in the future</i>
<i>of me still being there.</i>

08:34.100 --> 08:36.433
<i>And I quit on the spot,</i>
<i>and I said, "I'm gonna be a magician."</i>

08:38.366 --> 08:41.067
My stuff isn't like, fire, fire, dove.
It's not that kind of thing.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.767
<i>It's more like weird things</i>

08:42.832 --> 08:45.233
<i>like gymnastics and stunts</i>
<i>and party tricks, basically.</i>

08:48.467 --> 08:49.800
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

08:50.100 --> 08:52.233
Please welcome Wes Barker.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.167
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

08:58.267 --> 09:00.167
Uh, hi, I'm Wes. Normally I use, like,

09:00.233 --> 09:02.867
a big, strong guy for this trick.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.633
But we can just use Jonathan, I guess.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.200
Okay. Okay.

09:06.267 --> 09:07.500
You're here... You're on this side,

09:07.567 --> 09:08.867
-sound good?
-Okay.

09:08.933 --> 09:12.000
Oh, yeah. Look at this.
Right? Oh, yeah, you work out, right?

09:12.067 --> 09:13.200
-You're liking that?
-Yeah, you know.

09:13.267 --> 09:14.800
You're not so bad yourself, I'll tell you.

09:14.867 --> 09:16.267
Thank you. Whew.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.733
That's what we call firm hot
cross buns down there in England.

09:20.033 --> 09:22.267
I knew if I came to Vegas,
something would happen.

09:23.367 --> 09:25.067
-What's this?
-That is a phone book.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.900
It's a phone book.
They're super irrelevant.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.033
You guys are clapping for phone books,
don't do that. Thank you.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.900
Phone books are super irrelevant,

09:30.967 --> 09:32.467
but I made a magic trick out of it,
because why not?

09:32.533 --> 09:33.667
-Have a look at this one.
-Okay.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.567
Make it... Make sure it's, like,

09:35.633 --> 09:37.067
all, I don't know, normal phone book.

09:37.133 --> 09:38.200
It's a normal phone book.

09:38.267 --> 09:39.367
Check, make sure all the pages
are different.

09:39.433 --> 09:40.467
That's gonna be very important.

09:40.533 --> 09:41.933
They're all different as far
as I can see, certainly.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.133
-BARKER: Cool, cool, cool.
-Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.333
All right, you're gonna
give me the phone book,

09:44.400 --> 09:46.233
and you're gonna grab the pen and paper.

09:47.033 --> 09:49.133
What's gonna happen is I'm going
to roll through the phone book

09:49.200 --> 09:50.267
-like this. Look through.
-Yep.

09:50.333 --> 09:51.833
You're going to say stop
wherever you want.

09:51.900 --> 09:52.967
-Okay.
-And then, uh,

09:53.033 --> 09:54.100
you're going to write down
the page number.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.200
Okay.

09:55.267 --> 09:56.267
So whenever you want, I'm not gonna look,

09:56.333 --> 09:58.067
-so whenever you want, just say stop.
-Stop.

09:58.133 --> 09:59.900
Right there? You happy?
You want to go more? You good?

09:59.967 --> 10:01.000
No, no, I'm good. Okay.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.567
All right, write it down.
I'll try and hold it for you.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.600
-Okay, got it.
-You got it? Okay.

10:04.667 --> 10:05.767
Good.

10:05.833 --> 10:07.333
-Can I put it down here?
-Yeah, put it down there. Yep.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.367
Okay. Now I need you to rip this in half.

10:09.433 --> 10:10.533
Okay.

10:11.367 --> 10:13.867
But don't do it this way.
Don't do, like, the spine.

10:13.933 --> 10:16.167
Okay, that's not the way.
And a lot of funny guys like to do it,

10:16.233 --> 10:17.400
like, where they'll open it up
in the middle,

10:17.467 --> 10:18.767
and they'll go like...
And they go like that.

10:18.833 --> 10:19.967
Don't do it that way either.
That's not good.

10:20.267 --> 10:21.433
I want you to rip it, uh,

10:21.500 --> 10:23.133
-top to bottom.
-Try and rip it top to bottom?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.600
-Yeah.
-Really?

10:24.667 --> 10:27.033
-BARKER: Yeah.
-I feel bad doing this in front of you.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.700
-I mean, it's kind of easy.
-Come on.

10:28.767 --> 10:30.633
You know, well, here's the thing,
I think...

10:30.700 --> 10:31.700
You're a vegan, aren't you?
You can't do it.

10:31.767 --> 10:34.300
-I've weakened it for you.
-Oh, yeah, no, you have. You have.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.433
I just want to make sure that
you know this is fair, right?

10:37.500 --> 10:38.600
Yes, I can't do that.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.600
This has been super fair
so far, and you can't do it.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.500
-I can't do it.
-Um, so it's a real phone book,

10:42.567 --> 10:44.800
but I'm going to give it a go here.
I'm gonna do it like this.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.233
(GRUNTING)

10:47.800 --> 10:49.100
Come on.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.600
(GRUNTING)

10:53.900 --> 10:56.733
-Ladies?
-Wow, wow.

10:57.233 --> 10:58.600
(APPLAUDING)

11:01.067 --> 11:04.367
-This is the part we need.
-I'm scared of you right now.

11:05.867 --> 11:07.400
What I'm going to get you
to do is I'm gonna get you to

11:07.467 --> 11:08.667
-fan 'em out in your hand.
-Sure.

11:08.733 --> 11:10.367
And then in a minute,
you're gonna throw them in the air.

11:10.433 --> 11:11.600
-Okay.
-Don't throw them like this,

11:11.667 --> 11:12.700
'cause they kind of stay in a clump.

11:12.767 --> 11:15.200
Throw them, like, more on
an angle, and then they'll, you know...

11:15.267 --> 11:16.667
-So they spread. Like confetti?
-Yeah.

11:16.733 --> 11:18.600
Yeah, and you're going
to stand right about there.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.867
-About here?
-Little bit, yeah right there, that'll do.

11:20.933 --> 11:22.267
Yeah, this is good, spread
'em in my hand like this?

11:22.333 --> 11:23.433
But you're gonna face me a bit more,

11:23.500 --> 11:24.633
'cause you're gonna
throw them around this area.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.067
I need my thing. Hang on, I need my thing.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.100
-I'm gonna do, uh...
-Hold on.

11:29.167 --> 11:31.667
Yeah, so, like, I'm gonna...
And then I'm gonna... Pow.

11:31.733 --> 11:32.900
Oh, you're gonna... Okay.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.667
So you're gonna throw them,
and I'm gonna stab your page.

11:34.733 --> 11:35.800
-Okay.
-All right?

11:35.867 --> 11:38.900
So yeah, I'm this guy, like,
ah, and you're that guy, like that, right?

11:38.967 --> 11:41.067
-You're sure? I could...
-Well...

11:41.133 --> 11:42.633
-I could do it from here.
-No, right here's good.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.167
-I'm good at throwing.
-No, right here. You're going to be okay.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.733
-I'm really good at throwing.
-You're okay.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.767
So, uh, yeah, basically, um...

11:48.833 --> 11:50.400
Yeah, you're gonna go like that.
I'm gonna go like that.

11:50.467 --> 11:52.600
They're gonna go like, "Yeah," like that.
Okay, good. All right.

11:52.667 --> 11:55.033
-All right, you good?
-You done this before?

11:55.100 --> 11:57.467
-I just want...
-Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Okay.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.200
Oh, oh, what? It's not a sharp sword?

11:59.267 --> 12:01.100
Okay. All right.
If it wasn't a real sword,

12:01.167 --> 12:03.867
could I do this, huh? Twing, twing, right?

12:03.933 --> 12:04.967
ROSS: That's a real sword.

12:05.033 --> 12:06.267
I mean, probably...
I don't know, probably I could

12:06.333 --> 12:08.500
just... Okay, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter. All right.

12:08.567 --> 12:10.733
I'll be honest. I'm more scared
to get one of your fingers in me.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.567
Okay. Here we go.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.733
-You good? You look good.
-Okay, so fan out.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.200
So high around me.
So maybe angle to me more.

12:18.267 --> 12:19.867
-Angle a bit more to me.
-Okay.

12:19.933 --> 12:20.933
Angle it, yeah, right there.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.733
-You're good. Okay.
-I spread it all out. Ready?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.467
Here we go. Yep. Throw the pages.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.467
On the count of three.

12:26.533 --> 12:27.867
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:32.667 --> 12:34.333
You're kidding me.

12:35.233 --> 12:36.367
Well...

12:36.433 --> 12:39.033
Jonathan, everything's
on the count of three.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.400
You're holding the sword.

12:40.467 --> 12:43.267
I'm just doing what you say
as soon as you say it.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.800
Everything's on the count of three.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.633
One, two, three, lift.
One, two, three, go.

12:49.700 --> 12:50.800
Sex, one, two, three, right?

12:51.067 --> 12:52.233
I've been married 28 years.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.400
When my wife says do something,
I do it straight away.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.500
All right.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.900
I have one more phone book.

13:01.133 --> 13:03.033
This is the last phone book
in the whole building, I'm sure.

13:03.267 --> 13:04.367
You want to rip it for me?

13:04.433 --> 13:06.133
You know what,
why don't you just go straight ahead?

13:06.200 --> 13:07.500
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Here, I'll just...

13:08.567 --> 13:10.500
Son of a... Come...

13:11.500 --> 13:12.933
I call this one Jonathan.

13:15.133 --> 13:17.200
That's a lot of anger coming out there.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.300
Wow, let's hear it again.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.400
Ladies?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.733
Two in a night.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.067
Two in the one night.

13:25.133 --> 13:27.267
Now, I should have told you
at the count of three.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.367
-That's my fault.
-Yes.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.900
-But that was a horrible toss.
-Yes.

13:29.967 --> 13:32.000
-I'm standing over here...
-Well, it's the first time

13:32.067 --> 13:34.233
I've ever seen a phone book
ripped in half by a human man.

13:35.867 --> 13:37.167
This is our last try.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.267
-Okay.
-Take those.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.667
You did good with the, you know...

13:39.733 --> 13:41.833
It was the wrong dir...
Try and throw them more straight up, okay?

13:41.900 --> 13:43.500
Okay. More straight up.

13:43.567 --> 13:45.167
'Cause it was a good spread,

13:45.233 --> 13:47.567
-just spread them out a bit.
-I'm doing my best.

13:47.633 --> 13:48.833
I know, you're... You'll be great.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.600
You can't mess this up. It's fine.
In fact, I'll even let you count.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.900
You count to three. You throw it, okay?

13:53.967 --> 13:55.000
-So you want...
-And then just, like,

13:55.067 --> 13:57.333
-around me, you know, just straight up.
-One, two, three, go?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.767
-Nice and high.
-One, two, three, go?

13:58.833 --> 14:00.667
Or one, two, three,
then do it without saying go?

14:00.733 --> 14:02.000
Whatever you want
'cause I'm gonna watch you.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.300
I'm just gonna watch you this time.

14:06.833 --> 14:08.700
One, two, three, go!

14:11.767 --> 14:12.900
Oh, I got one.

14:12.967 --> 14:14.767
-Wow.
-Wouldn't that be crazy?

14:14.833 --> 14:18.267
Uh, I have 520 and 521.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.367
What do you have? Show the audience.

14:20.433 --> 14:21.500
520.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.200
-Thank you.
-Holy moly.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.533
That was awesome. Wes, that was awesome.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.333
Wasn't that great?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.567
And two of them in one night.

14:33.633 --> 14:36.633
Okay, we'll let Penn and Teller
talk about what they just saw.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.867
I know they enjoyed it very much
whether they know... That was incredible.

14:39.933 --> 14:41.133
-Thank you.
-Now, here's the thing.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.733
I know you had some early days.
Your early days,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.500
they were working hard days for you
as a magician, right?

14:45.567 --> 14:47.900
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Man, this is a far cry

14:47.967 --> 14:49.900
from the $50 gigs I used to do
at old age homes.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.000
Wow. Well, not that far necessarily,

14:52.067 --> 14:53.667
because I'm kind of heading that way,

14:53.733 --> 14:55.400
and the fellas ain't
getting any younger either.

14:55.467 --> 14:56.600
That's true.

14:56.667 --> 14:59.000
But you wouldn't do this act
in an old people's home.

14:59.067 --> 15:01.700
-Oh, yeah, I will. I will.
-So you would get an old man

15:01.767 --> 15:03.933
in an old people's home and ask
him to rip a phone book in half?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.633
And I would ridicule him when
he couldn't do it.

15:05.700 --> 15:06.700
(LAUGHS)

15:07.233 --> 15:08.900
Uh, I think the guys
are ready now, so I'm going to go

15:08.967 --> 15:11.533
to Penn and hear his verdict
on what you just performed for us.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.300
Well, I'll tell you. That was amazing.

15:15.367 --> 15:18.867
It has been a very, very long time

15:18.933 --> 15:20.600
since we've seen a phone book.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.433
(LAUGHING)

15:23.067 --> 15:26.367
And I know kinetically,
that you hung a little

15:26.433 --> 15:29.733
lantern on that saying it was
irrelevant, but still,

15:29.800 --> 15:33.667
it's a hard time for strong men now,
tearing a phone book in half

15:33.733 --> 15:37.200
because tearing an iPhone
in half is much more difficult.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.100
-Yeah.
-Takes a lot more energy.

15:39.167 --> 15:40.900
And in your phone book, you know,

15:40.967 --> 15:43.667
I don't know what city that was.
That a Vegas phone book?

15:43.733 --> 15:46.100
No, I think it's from where
I live in Vancouver.

15:46.167 --> 15:48.533
Vancouver. Oh, so you wouldn't have

15:48.600 --> 15:52.300
Luke Skywalker's number
in that phone book, would you?

15:52.500 --> 15:53.533
-I don't think so.
-But that would have helped

15:53.600 --> 15:55.133
you do the trick a lot, wouldn't it?

15:55.200 --> 15:57.700
-The, uh...
-But when you say Luke Skywalker,

15:57.767 --> 15:58.833
are you, uh, are you

15:58.900 --> 16:01.100
suggesting that he's famous
for something in particular?

16:01.167 --> 16:03.233
-Yes, I am.
-Okay, did that thing

16:03.300 --> 16:06.567
in particular feature in this,
at the end there?

16:06.633 --> 16:10.533
Oh, I... Sorry. Took me a while there.
Uh, no.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.700
-No?
-No. It did not.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.933
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
we'll explain some of this in a minute

16:15.000 --> 16:16.700
once they explain it to me, okay?

16:17.200 --> 16:19.300
-Well, I can...
-I was missing what you were saying,

16:19.367 --> 16:22.833
but I totally am on your
page now, and, uh, no, it... No.

16:23.333 --> 16:27.433
This could be, I think, rather remarkably

16:27.500 --> 16:30.767
one of those moments
where Penn and Teller

16:30.833 --> 16:33.333
-wouldn't quite know how it's done.
-What they're saying is awesome.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.500
You can totally do the trick that way.
It's just not how I did it.

16:35.567 --> 16:39.500
Hmm. But if you're saying it's
absolutely not a force...

16:39.567 --> 16:42.000
-Right.
-Then it had to be a holding

16:42.067 --> 16:44.000
a break in the peek afterwards.

16:44.067 --> 16:45.100
Yes.

16:45.167 --> 16:47.767
And then you would have
to have some sort of index there

16:47.833 --> 16:50.333
after you held the break and did a peek.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.167
Um, no index.

16:52.233 --> 16:54.400
No, and it's not
the second phone book you're using.

16:54.467 --> 16:56.167
Boom, boom, take that, Penn.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.767
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

16:57.833 --> 17:00.933
Sorry, I don't mean to... I don't mean
to enjoy that moment too much,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.467
but, man, I enjoy this moment.

17:02.533 --> 17:05.467
Okay, we have taken...
This is just ridiculous.

17:05.532 --> 17:09.067
We have taken two runs at this,

17:09.133 --> 17:13.633
almost seems like we're about
to cross into unfair...

17:13.700 --> 17:15.733
It almost seems like we're cheating.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.900
Magicians are supposed to cheat.

17:18.967 --> 17:23.133
You have cheated better than us.
You, sir, have fooled us.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.000
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
-PENN: That was awesome.

17:27.433 --> 17:29.267
-Wow.
-Yes!

17:29.333 --> 17:31.100
-Nicely done.
-Bring it down.

17:31.167 --> 17:32.967
Oh, man. Thank you.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.833
ROSS: Penn, you want to do the honors?

17:34.900 --> 17:37.500
-There you go.
-Oh, I didn't... Thanks, guys.

17:37.567 --> 17:40.267
-That's...
-There you go.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.000
That's it, man.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.367
-Nicely done.
-Appreciate it, thank you.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.400
Wes, how good does that feel right now?

17:45.467 --> 17:48.300
Uh, it's such a...
Yeah, I don't know. I got no words.

17:48.367 --> 17:49.967
-This is amazing. Thank you.
-Wow.

17:50.033 --> 17:52.233
So, from the road crew, how long ago
since you started out in magic?

17:52.300 --> 17:53.567
Uh, eight years?

17:53.633 --> 17:55.767
Eight years ago from the road crew,
ladies and gentlemen,

17:55.833 --> 17:58.000
working out there entertaining
his friends to fooling

17:58.067 --> 18:01.267
Penn and Teller here on the big stage
in Las Vegas.

18:01.967 --> 18:03.367
That was great, wasn't it?

18:03.433 --> 18:05.467
-Thank you.
-Wes Barker.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.400
ROSS: Wow.

18:09.267 --> 18:10.533
Let's have a look at our next wizard.

18:13.267 --> 18:16.333
<i>Hi, I'm Matthew Holtzclaw,</i>
<i>and I live in New York City, New York.</i>

18:17.267 --> 18:19.433
Hi, welcome. I'll give you the grand tour.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.033
<i>You know, if magic were real,</i>

18:21.100 --> 18:23.500
<i>I would add some square footage</i>
<i>to this place.</i>

18:23.867 --> 18:25.267
I think I probably was attracted

18:25.333 --> 18:28.733
<i>to magic because magic is,</i>
<i>at its heart, a display of power.</i>

18:28.800 --> 18:31.733
<i>It does give you a sense of</i>
<i>"I can do something."</i>

18:32.400 --> 18:36.067
I've always been attracted
to the macabre and horror.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.933
<i>I like the irony of watching</i>

18:38.000 --> 18:40.633
something violent and knowing
that the people are totally safe.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.567
<i>I think it's the same thing as magic.</i>
<i>It's this beautiful irony</i>

18:43.633 --> 18:45.167
<i>inside your head, knowing what</i>

18:45.233 --> 18:47.767
<i>you're seeing is not real, you know,</i>
<i>as it appears to be so.</i>

18:47.833 --> 18:49.100
My favorite magicians growing up,

18:49.167 --> 18:51.667
the first magicians I saw
on TV were Penn and Teller.

18:51.733 --> 18:55.067
<i>I thought that's what magic was,</i>
<i>this personality and this attitude.</i>

18:55.133 --> 18:56.233
The idea that I'm on the show

18:56.300 --> 18:59.133
with Penn and Teller,
the 12-year-old me is screaming.

18:59.467 --> 19:02.633
But the 36-year-old me
is screaming too, just quietly.

19:02.733 --> 19:05.533
But like a little girl
with a flower basket and a bonnet.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.167
(SQUEALS)

19:08.233 --> 19:09.533
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

19:13.200 --> 19:16.267
Our next performer
is a burlesque magician,

19:16.333 --> 19:17.600
which means every morning he gets dressed,

19:17.667 --> 19:19.600
the first thing he does
is put tassels on his nipples.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.000
Will you please welcome Matthew Holtzclaw!

19:22.967 --> 19:24.333
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

19:29.867 --> 19:32.500
Wow. They said the stage would be huge,

19:32.567 --> 19:35.500
and it is, and they said
the audience would be massive,

19:35.567 --> 19:36.967
and you are.

19:37.033 --> 19:40.900
So of course, the trick
that I brought involves the tiniest

19:40.967 --> 19:42.600
little white thread.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.667
Excellent planning on my part.

19:45.733 --> 19:47.900
I'm actually gonna do two tricks tonight.

19:47.967 --> 19:51.700
Uh, the first trick is extremely
elegant and beautiful.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.700
One of the most beautiful
in the history of magic.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.433
It may evoke images of life,

19:56.500 --> 19:59.133
death, resurrection.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.533
And the second trick is devoid
of all poetry.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.367
It's entirely vile and hateful

20:04.433 --> 20:07.200
and offensive to most cultures
on the planet.

20:07.267 --> 20:08.533
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING MILDLY)

20:08.600 --> 20:10.133
We'll do the pretty one first.

20:12.567 --> 20:16.400
You know, this trick is, uh,
incredibly difficult for me to do.

20:17.267 --> 20:20.800
Not technically, it's just...
There's something incredibly

20:20.867 --> 20:23.167
pretentious about a grown man

20:23.233 --> 20:24.733
solemnly tearing up a piece of thread

20:24.800 --> 20:28.633
in front of a bunch of strangers
as a bit of performance art,

20:29.867 --> 20:32.267
wearing a suit made of meat,

20:32.333 --> 20:37.333
howling atonally about my inner
and outer body shapes.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.133
I think what's most difficult

20:39.200 --> 20:42.733
about this trick
is that everyone knows the ending.

20:43.967 --> 20:45.633
(MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

21:02.133 --> 21:03.600
That's not the ending.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.033
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:21.967 --> 21:23.800
-Thank you.
-(APPLAUDING)

21:26.700 --> 21:27.967
Souvenir.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.500
-I'll sign that later.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:31.567 --> 21:33.200
Somehow or another.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.400
So listen, I can do the gross trick,

21:35.467 --> 21:37.367
or I can give you a choice.
I can do another pretty one.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.533
You guys want to see a pretty one,
or you want to see a gross one?

21:39.600 --> 21:41.133
AUDIENCE: Gross!

21:41.667 --> 21:43.100
That's pretty unanimous.

21:43.900 --> 21:44.900
All right.

21:45.733 --> 21:47.300
You asked for it.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.100
This uses thread too.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.433
Just this much though.

21:51.500 --> 21:55.167
And this little bit of thread
is going to magically wind its way

21:55.467 --> 21:59.367
through my delicate, sensitive sinuses.

21:59.433 --> 22:01.000
AUDIENCE: Ew!

22:01.767 --> 22:03.000
You're welcome.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.800
Goes in the mouth first.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.000
(GAGS)

22:15.000 --> 22:17.400
Actually, Jonathan, you should join me.

22:17.867 --> 22:21.000
-Get a closer look.
-Really? You want me to join you in this?

22:21.067 --> 22:22.100
-Yeah, please, join me.
-Okay.

22:24.867 --> 22:26.233
(SNIFFS)

22:26.333 --> 22:27.567
(SNORTS)

22:28.667 --> 22:30.500
Anyone want to change their vote
at this point?

22:31.067 --> 22:32.733
-Yeah, let's go pretty.
-Go pretty?

22:32.967 --> 22:35.600
I think this is pretty. (SNIFFING)

22:37.133 --> 22:40.000
All right, it's all...
I have a college degree, by the way.

22:41.733 --> 22:43.967
-String theory.
-(LAUGHING)

22:49.400 --> 22:51.567
All right, I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

22:52.533 --> 22:54.700
You think that's bad over there,
I'm right next to this guy.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.867
All right, all right,
it's there, it's there, it's there.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.433
ROSS: Aw, no.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.833
Aw.

23:08.167 --> 23:10.433
You just said "gross,"
not really revolting.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.833
(CHUCKLES)

23:14.067 --> 23:16.700
That's horrible.
Inevitably I'll have to say,

23:16.767 --> 23:20.100
don't try this at home,
but you'd have to be stupid, wouldn't you?

23:21.833 --> 23:22.867
Aw.

23:23.867 --> 23:26.100
Oh. That's coming right out of there.

23:26.167 --> 23:27.333
BOTH: Oh.

23:27.567 --> 23:30.100
ROSS: How did you do that?
Wow, ladies and gentlemen,

23:31.133 --> 23:32.767
Matthew... Oh, really?

23:32.833 --> 23:34.533
-Yeah, come on.
-Oh, okay.

23:35.167 --> 23:37.767
Okay. Matthew Holtzclaw,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.900
Unbelievable. I'm right this close.
That was incredible.

23:41.833 --> 23:45.433
Okay, we're gonna ask Penn and Teller
to chat about this and deliberate.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.033
I know you're a big fan
of bringing horror into magic.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.533
That was kind of borderline horrific.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.900
Yeah, no blood, no gore,
no needles, nothing like that.

23:51.967 --> 23:54.833
Yeah, but I do like
when things are provocative, you know?

23:54.900 --> 23:56.967
So you do stuff that is more gory onstage?

23:57.033 --> 24:00.833
Occasionally, yeah, yeah,
cut my hand off and that sort of thing.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.000
-So what is wrong with you?
-(LAUGHING)

24:04.767 --> 24:08.033
So the gentlemen, I think, have
come to the end of their deliberations.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.567
I thought that was just fabulous.

24:09.633 --> 24:11.733
I'm sure they did too,
but did you fool them? Let's find out.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.600
I got to tell you,
that Hindu thread trick is a trick

24:14.667 --> 24:18.467
that I've seen Teller do,
and I'm very, very glad...

24:19.133 --> 24:20.733
Not as glad as Teller is,
but I'm very glad

24:20.800 --> 24:23.467
you did it with thread instead
of with yarn.

24:23.533 --> 24:26.733
A lot of people try
to improve it, and it's just perfect

24:26.800 --> 24:29.600
in the Hindu... In the thread version.

24:30.067 --> 24:32.067
This show, we love the fact

24:32.133 --> 24:35.333
that it covers all sorts of stuff.
We know that you could have

24:35.400 --> 24:38.367
burned us with cards.
You're fabulous with cards.

24:38.433 --> 24:42.267
And we love the fact you did
something grosser, something wilder,

24:42.333 --> 24:45.300
something crazier,
but you may have seen us do...

24:45.367 --> 24:47.067
Which we did not invent but you may

24:47.133 --> 24:50.033
-have seen us do a trick with a bean.
-Oh, yeah.

24:50.100 --> 24:54.133
And the trick you did with
the thread is the same

24:54.200 --> 24:55.900
-as our trick with the bean...
-Absolutely.

24:55.967 --> 24:59.033
But, boy,
making it with thread is fabulous.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.533
It's such a great idea to do
that with thread.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.400
-Yeah, it's terrific.
-I wish we'd thought of it,

25:03.467 --> 25:06.233
and if we'd thought of it,
we would be doing it all the time.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.933
-ROSS: Wow.
-That's a wonderful trick.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.867
We know how it's done.
It did not lessen it at all.

25:10.933 --> 25:12.433
-That was fabulous.
-Thank you.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.600
ROSS: So, Matthew, let me just check.

25:14.667 --> 25:17.200
You're happy that they know
what they're talking about over there?

25:17.267 --> 25:18.767
-I'm just thrilled to be here.
-Yeah.

25:18.833 --> 25:21.400
I think you knew coming out here that,
knowing them as well as you do,

25:21.467 --> 25:22.467
that they were gonna get you.

25:22.533 --> 25:24.867
Yeah, no, it's just a thrill
to be here, guys. Thanks so much.

25:24.933 --> 25:26.300
-Fabulous, fabulous.
-ROSS: But it was great.

25:26.367 --> 25:28.433
Now, everyone here, we loved it,
didn't we, ladies and gentlemen?

25:28.500 --> 25:31.300
It was awesome.
I'm gonna keep this as a souvenir.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.100
Matthew Holtzclaw, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Matthew.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.633
(APPLAUDING)

25:35.700 --> 25:36.867
Great idea.

25:36.933 --> 25:40.067
Now, for my next trick,
I'd like to make another magician appear.

25:42.767 --> 25:44.300
REGAL: <i>I'm David Regal.</i>

25:44.733 --> 25:46.133
Open sesame.

25:49.133 --> 25:54.400
<i>I think magic is more than just cool</i>
<i>because magic translates to hope.</i>

25:56.133 --> 25:58.500
Magic for me has always been my therapy.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.433
It occupies me, mind, body, soul.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.133
<i>If I didn't have magic,</i>
<i>I would need an actual therapist.</i>

26:05.367 --> 26:07.067
<i>Just doing it as someone who loves it,</i>

26:07.133 --> 26:09.033
<i>I can keep coming up</i>
<i>with new ideas and tinkering.</i>

26:09.100 --> 26:11.333
You wake up, you clear the kitchen table,

26:11.400 --> 26:13.067
<i>and you wreck things in your house.</i>

26:14.067 --> 26:17.400
<i>What I'm gonna try and do</i>
<i>for Penn and Teller is a simple trick</i>

26:17.467 --> 26:20.767
<i>with a simple plot</i>
<i>where just one thing happens,</i>

26:20.833 --> 26:22.233
<i>and I want that one thing to fool them.</i>

26:22.733 --> 26:23.900
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

26:24.333 --> 26:28.033
So the next performer serves
on the board of the Magic Castle,

26:28.100 --> 26:30.533
which is super impressive, but as someone

26:30.600 --> 26:33.367
who still serves as vice president
of the Spice Girls Fan Club,

26:33.433 --> 26:36.167
I like to think we're equals.
Will you please welcome David Regal!

26:36.667 --> 26:38.600
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

26:44.133 --> 26:47.033
Before I get started, Teller,
I'd like to give you this,

26:47.100 --> 26:50.600
so it's in safe hands for the duration.

26:50.667 --> 26:53.767
I want to tell you about a guy
that means a lot to me.

26:56.833 --> 27:00.767
This is my grandfather.
He was the guy in my life.

27:00.833 --> 27:03.000
I was always, "Grandpa, pick a card."

27:03.067 --> 27:05.333
Didn't matter what the occasion
was... It was his birthday...

27:05.400 --> 27:08.033
"Grandpa, pick a card."
We're at a restaurant.

27:08.100 --> 27:09.500
"Grandpa, pick a card."

27:09.900 --> 27:13.167
And, uh, near the end of his life,

27:13.233 --> 27:15.433
he called me to his bedside,

27:15.500 --> 27:19.000
and he said, "David,

27:20.667 --> 27:24.633
"never ask another person to pick a card."

27:24.833 --> 27:26.300
(LAUGHING)

27:26.367 --> 27:31.433
So in honor of my grandfather,
tonight I will not have a card selected.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.800
(APPLAUDING)

27:36.533 --> 27:39.667
However, I thought it might be interesting

27:39.733 --> 27:41.567
to have some cards

27:41.633 --> 27:43.067
not selected.

27:43.133 --> 27:45.533
For this, I need the help
of a kind soul from the audience.

27:45.833 --> 27:49.733
Penn, please come on up here.
Penn Jillette, ladies and gentlemen.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.433
Thank you so much.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
-Thank you, Penn.
-Thank you.

27:53.567 --> 27:55.500
Penn of course... Penn is wearing

27:55.567 --> 27:58.900
the pinstripe suit creating
the illusion of height.

27:58.967 --> 28:00.267
(LAUGHING)

28:02.367 --> 28:04.767
Penn, behind the table,
please examine the cards.

28:04.833 --> 28:07.433
Have a good look at them,
mix them up if you'd like to mix them up.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.700
It's important to give them a once-over,

28:09.767 --> 28:13.100
'cause we're gonna try something
a little unusual.

28:13.167 --> 28:15.167
-Is everything okay for you there?
-They seem okay.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.067
-Okay, I'll take that as an okay.
-Yep.

28:17.133 --> 28:18.800
Oh, doing all the normal, okay.

28:18.867 --> 28:21.200
Here's what we're gonna do.
Spread them out.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.467
Hold a finger
about two feet above those cards, Penn.

28:23.533 --> 28:27.067
Move that finger left, right,
right, left, and let that finger

28:27.133 --> 28:29.833
slowly descend until that finger

28:29.900 --> 28:32.633
is resting on just one card.

28:32.700 --> 28:34.433
Perhaps you think
you've selected that card, Penn,

28:34.500 --> 28:37.000
but I assure you, that is not the case.

28:37.067 --> 28:38.133
Okay.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.067
Pull out that card.
Call out its name to everybody.

28:41.733 --> 28:45.000
The jack of hearts.

28:45.067 --> 28:47.400
-Has just been not selected.
-Okay.

28:47.800 --> 28:48.800
(LAUGHING)

28:49.100 --> 28:50.967
Fifty cards to go.

28:52.367 --> 28:54.433
Take your finger.
Go left, right... No, no, no,

28:54.500 --> 28:55.700
we'll speed it up.
I wouldn't be that cruel here.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.233
We'll put them all here.
Cut them into three piles, Penn.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.567
Three piles any way you like.

29:00.867 --> 29:04.133
Excellent, you've just not
selected the six of hearts,

29:04.200 --> 29:07.867
the jack of clubs,
and the eight of hearts.

29:07.933 --> 29:09.500
Pick up any one of those piles.
Any one of them.

29:09.733 --> 29:11.800
Look through it like
it's a giant poker hand.

29:11.867 --> 29:13.400
Look at the high cards, the low cards,

29:13.467 --> 29:15.967
all the cards in between
until your eyes fall on one card.

29:16.033 --> 29:18.100
That means something to you
and only you for reasons...

29:18.167 --> 29:20.533
Even reasons you do not understand.
Do you have that card?

29:21.133 --> 29:22.367
Okay.

29:22.433 --> 29:24.700
Now look at all the rest
and throw them away as well.

29:24.767 --> 29:27.167
-Okay.
-Pick up any of those piles.

29:27.233 --> 29:30.467
Go through them all,
and discard them with extreme prejudice.

29:32.333 --> 29:35.900
Yes, yes, and yes.

29:35.967 --> 29:37.700
He's still going.
Yes, here, let's spread the wealth.

29:37.767 --> 29:39.133
Grab some of these. Just grab some.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.967
Here, let's go in the audience.
Out in the audience.

29:41.033 --> 29:43.600
Down these stairs. Come on, Penn.
One to each person here.

29:43.667 --> 29:45.633
Oh, he's not giving you any.
Okay, it's not my fault.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.400
There we are. If you have a card...
If Penn gave you a card,

29:48.467 --> 29:50.367
I will come to you.
When I come to you, call out

29:50.433 --> 29:52.600
the name of your card and throw it away.

29:53.267 --> 29:55.667
-What have you got?
-WOMAN: Nine...

29:55.733 --> 29:57.333
Nine of spades. Throw it away.
What have you got?

29:57.733 --> 29:59.900
-Joker.
-Throw it away. What have you got?

30:00.300 --> 30:02.233
-Ten of clubs.
-Throw it away. What have you got?

30:02.433 --> 30:04.467
-Ace of hearts.
-Throw it away. What have you got?

30:04.533 --> 30:05.533
Four of diamonds.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.600
Four of diamonds. Throw it away.

30:06.667 --> 30:07.800
-What have you got?
-Queen of spades.

30:07.867 --> 30:08.900
Throw it away.
Anyone else? What have you got?

30:08.967 --> 30:10.133
Eight of clubs. Throw it away.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.067
Anyone else? Penn, follow me.
We're not done. We still have a few cards.

30:13.133 --> 30:15.633
A few cards left, Penn. Here we go.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.833
We have a five of hearts,
an ace of clubs, a three of diamonds,

30:18.900 --> 30:21.433
four of spades, two of hearts.
Let's give them a little mix.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.733
I will lay them out just like this, Penn.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.167
Penn, I promise you,
I will always count in this direction.

30:26.467 --> 30:28.767
Any number, one to five, I will discard.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.700
Number one to five, what should go away?

30:30.767 --> 30:32.100
-One.
-One. Goodbye.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.867
-One, two, three, or four? Four, go away.
-Four.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.367
-One, two, or three?
-Two.

30:36.433 --> 30:37.500
Go away. One or two?

30:37.567 --> 30:39.800
-One.
-Goes away.

30:40.900 --> 30:43.733
We are down to one card.

30:44.267 --> 30:46.067
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

30:52.433 --> 30:55.867
I think we can all agree,
that card has not been selected.

30:57.233 --> 31:00.567
However, it's also not been

31:00.633 --> 31:02.933
not selected.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.267
A round of applause for Penn Jillette.
He may return. The gentle giant.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.700
Penn Jillette.

31:09.067 --> 31:10.400
Oh, my gosh.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.267
Oh, my gosh.

31:12.333 --> 31:13.567
Teller.

31:14.100 --> 31:17.400
Teller, that envelope has been
in your hands this entire time.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.600
Let me tell you something about it.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.767
Near the end of my granddad's life,

31:23.833 --> 31:26.967
obviously he couldn't see the cards
as well as he used to see them,

31:27.033 --> 31:29.233
so I went out and got those big cards,
the jumbo kind.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.767
Held it right up to his face.

31:31.833 --> 31:33.633
He just grabbed them out of my hands

31:33.700 --> 31:36.700
and ran out back
where we have the wood chipper.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.200
By the time I caught up with him,
he'd destroyed every card

31:41.267 --> 31:44.133
in that deck, except for one.

31:44.767 --> 31:48.033
In that envelope is the one card

31:49.067 --> 31:50.133
buried with my granddad.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.300
Could you open that up?
Keep it this side up.

31:52.367 --> 31:54.000
The card will slide out face down.

31:54.067 --> 31:56.567
Keep it face down. Make sure
nothing else is in that envelope.

31:56.633 --> 32:00.633
I will gingerly carry this card
over to the table.

32:02.433 --> 32:03.700
(EXHALES)

32:05.533 --> 32:08.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
two cards are before you.

32:08.267 --> 32:11.600
One, a card that meant a great
deal to my grandfather.

32:11.667 --> 32:15.667
The other, a card not not selected

32:15.733 --> 32:18.067
in the fairest possible manner.

32:19.267 --> 32:20.467
(SIGHS)

How about that? That was great.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.233
-David, that was fabulous.
-Oh, thank you.

32:53.033 --> 32:54.100
I can see the cards.

32:54.167 --> 32:55.667
Now you know what I like to do
when you're performing?

32:55.733 --> 32:56.800
I like to watch their faces,

32:56.867 --> 32:58.967
and Teller looked really
like he was confused.

32:59.033 --> 33:00.100
He didn't know what was going on.

33:00.300 --> 33:02.633
Tell me, is it true that you met
your wife doing magic?

33:02.700 --> 33:07.600
Yes, it is. Um, I went into a bar
I'd never been to before or since,

33:07.667 --> 33:10.533
and I showed her card tricks,
and she liked them then.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.500
Yeah. And one thing led to another.

33:12.567 --> 33:14.600
Had you tried that on lots
of other women beforehand,

33:14.667 --> 33:17.600
-or was she the first lucky gal?
-The only successful occurrence

33:17.667 --> 33:19.033
of that happening, so I just married her.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.867
-I figured, what the hell?
-Yeah, quit while you're ahead.

33:20.933 --> 33:23.133
-Exactly so.
-Uh, I think the guys are ready,

33:23.200 --> 33:25.300
so we're going to go over
now to Penn and Teller and find out

33:25.367 --> 33:27.533
whether or not they could
work out how you did it.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.333
Now, this is a case where showmanship

33:31.400 --> 33:33.233
is everything.

33:33.633 --> 33:36.767
You had a legitimate deck of cards.

33:36.833 --> 33:38.867
There was nothing gimmicked
about them at all.

33:38.933 --> 33:42.067
You had us run down in the
audience and hand stuff out,

33:42.133 --> 33:44.733
all the cards were different,
all that stuff was being done.

33:44.800 --> 33:47.833
There were provers all the way along,

33:47.900 --> 33:50.300
and then there's the final cards

33:50.367 --> 33:51.933
you're gonna choose from.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.733
And, uh, I don't really remember.
Was I holding those, or was he?

33:56.400 --> 34:00.067
I think you were holding those
at the end, which gave you

34:00.133 --> 34:05.233
a little bit of time to do some
stuff that may not have been above board.

34:05.300 --> 34:09.033
All that matters is those final
few cards, and we think we have

34:09.100 --> 34:12.766
a pretty good idea what was up
with those final few cards.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.000
But, boy, it's a great trick,

34:15.067 --> 34:17.600
so you did not fool us, but, man,
I love that. Love that.

of <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us</i>

34:34.833 --> 34:36.367
if we didn't get to see Penn and Teller

34:36.433 --> 34:38.167
do some magic themselves,
so here they are.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.300
(CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

34:46.300 --> 34:49.667
Thank you. Several years ago we did
a series of documentaries for television.

34:49.733 --> 34:51.632
We traveled all over the world

34:51.699 --> 34:54.533
seeing street magic,
close-up magic in all different cultures.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.867
And just about everywhere we went,

34:57.933 --> 35:01.300
everybody did one trick the same.
They did the cups and balls.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.800
Almost every magician we met
did the cups and balls.

35:03.867 --> 35:05.200
And the trick around the world

35:05.267 --> 35:08.100
didn't change very much,
but the props did.

35:08.167 --> 35:11.000
In India, they had these
hand-carved wooden cups,

35:11.067 --> 35:13.533
and these little flocked cork balls.

35:13.667 --> 35:16.033
In China, they had these metal cups

35:16.100 --> 35:18.733
that were handed down
generation to generation.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.600
But Teller and I were working
for the United States of America,

35:21.667 --> 35:24.267
so we used red plastic cups.

35:24.367 --> 35:25.367
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

35:25.833 --> 35:29.300
And then we used aluminum foil balls.

35:29.367 --> 35:31.033
So we had the totally American

35:31.100 --> 35:34.300
and totally disposable cups and balls.

35:34.367 --> 35:37.600
It goes like this.
You take the ball, place it in our hand,

35:37.667 --> 35:40.300
vanish it, it appears underneath the cup.

35:40.367 --> 35:42.700
That's the way it's done
all around the world.

35:42.767 --> 35:46.100
You take the ball, you place it
in your hand, you vanish it,

35:46.167 --> 35:48.333
it appears underneath the cup.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400
Here's a little variation
Teller came up with

35:50.467 --> 35:51.500
where he takes the ball,

35:51.567 --> 35:53.267
places it in his hand,
then shows you underneath the cup,

35:53.333 --> 35:55.600
and it still appears underneath the cup.

35:56.267 --> 35:58.167
So you have three cups, three balls.

35:58.233 --> 36:00.700
Under that center ball,
puts it under the center cup,

36:00.767 --> 36:02.533
two side balls,
put them wherever you want,

36:02.600 --> 36:04.300
they still regroup under the center cup.

36:04.533 --> 36:08.033
I come over here,
just a little tiny bit of juggling.

36:08.100 --> 36:11.167
There's a giant ball in the center cup,
one more giant ball

36:11.233 --> 36:12.667
to either side, and of course

36:12.733 --> 36:17.533
for the finish,
it's an American baseball right there.

(APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

36:22.600 --> 36:25.333
Now that we've done the American
cups and balls for a while,

36:25.400 --> 36:29.233
I want to kind of zoom in
and do a Penn and Teller cups and balls,

36:29.333 --> 36:32.133
which involves breaking
a few rules of magic.

36:32.367 --> 36:34.300
Now, the first rule of magic is,

36:34.367 --> 36:37.167
you never do the same trick twice,

36:37.233 --> 36:38.533
so we're gonna.

36:38.600 --> 36:44.000
Second rule of magic is you never tell
an audience how a trick is being done.

36:44.067 --> 36:47.833
We're going to tell you exactly
how the trick is being done.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.800
The third rule of magic is,

36:49.867 --> 36:54.367
you never let the audience see your
secret preparation.

36:54.433 --> 36:58.033
They must not know what is
hidden in which pocket.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.400
And the fourth rule of magic is unwritten,

37:01.467 --> 37:04.867
but we think any magician in the world
would agree with us in a second

37:04.933 --> 37:07.633
that you never, ever do the cups and balls

37:07.700 --> 37:10.900
with clear plastic cups.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.700
So here's the Penn and Teller
version of the cups and balls.

37:16.767 --> 37:19.167
We did the first ball,
pretend to place it in our hand,

37:19.233 --> 37:21.333
have already snuck it underneath
the first cup.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.000
The second ball simultaneously secreted

37:23.067 --> 37:25.933
beneath the cup,
place it in our hand, and show it.

37:26.033 --> 37:28.100
Do the third and final ball,
pretend to place it in our hand,

37:28.167 --> 37:29.667
place it under the cup, place the cup,

37:29.733 --> 37:32.567
then secretly secrete it and reveal it.
Now we're all set for the second half,

37:32.633 --> 37:34.200
three cups all loaded,
three balls on top.

37:34.267 --> 37:35.300
So now the ball is in the cup.

37:35.367 --> 37:36.967
Each of the side balls,
we're gonna put them away.

37:37.033 --> 37:39.367
We don't need them anymore.
We have three duplicates inside the cup.

37:39.433 --> 37:42.367
I come over here. This is not juggling.
This is called misdirection.

37:42.433 --> 37:44.367
If we look over here,
Teller's got the final ball under,

37:44.433 --> 37:45.500
one ball on either side,

37:45.567 --> 37:50.100
and of course, for the finish,
it's an American baseball there.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.967
That's the Penn and Teller cups and balls.
