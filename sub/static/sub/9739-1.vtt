23:04.720 --> 23:07.007
Well, what did she say to you?

23:13.920 --> 23:17.606
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?

23:17.680 --> 23:19.489
Imaginary...

23:19.560 --> 23:21.403
Would you like to talk about him?

23:21.520 --> 23:24.729
- Frank.
- Frank.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.083
- What did Frank say?
- To follow him.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.288
- Where?
- Into the future.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.921
And then what happens?

23:35.280 --> 23:37.806
And then he said...

23:38.400 --> 23:42.086
Then he said the world was coming to an end.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.481
Do you think it is?

23:49.880 --> 23:51.962
No.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.489
That's stupid.

23:57.160 --> 24:01.165
<i>[TV] For my entire life I was a victim of fear.</i>

24:02.640 --> 24:04.449
<i>Love.</i>

24:05.480 --> 24:08.609
<i>I was feeding fear through food.</i>

24:13.040 --> 24:14.883
<i>Fear.</i>

24:21.320 --> 24:23.721
<i>Finally I looked in the mirror.</i>

24:23.800 --> 24:28.408
<i>Not just in the mirror. I looked through the mirror.</i>

24:28.480 --> 24:32.804
<i>In that image I saw my ego reflection.</i>

24:35.520 --> 24:39.286
<i>I thought ten-year-olds normally wet the bed.</i>

24:40.160 --> 24:42.242
- [Snorts]
- Shh!

24:46.200 --> 24:49.249
<i>The solution was there all the time.</i>

24:50.000 --> 24:52.082
<i>I'm not afraid any more!</i>

24:53.080 --> 24:58.211
<i>All over America, people have
come together to join hands.</i>

24:59.000 --> 25:05.963
<i>People who believe that human life
is absolutely too important,</i>

25:06.040 --> 25:11.410
<i>too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear.</i>

25:14.720 --> 25:16.324
<i>Hello.</i>

25:16.400 --> 25:20.007
<i>My name is Jim Cunningham.
Welcome to Controlling Fear.</i>

25:32.000 --> 25:34.480
<i>[Frank] Wake up, Donnie.</i>

26:11.960 --> 26:16.602
"And the prince was led into a world
of strange and beautiful magic."

26:16.720 --> 26:18.529
Hey, guess what!

26:18.600 --> 26:20.807
I can't believe it!

26:21.920 --> 26:24.446
The school is closed today because it's flooded.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.722
- No way.
- Yes.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.804
Holy shit! That's the best news I've ever heard.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.444
My God. Is this ever gonna stop?

26:39.520 --> 26:44.367
Eventually, yes. But I've got
12 classrooms full of water,

26:44.480 --> 26:47.324
all coming from a busted water main.

26:47.400 --> 26:50.529
- What else?
- What else?!

26:50.600 --> 26:53.331
Principal Cole, I'll show you what else.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.887
- Unbelievable.
- That's solid bronze, isn't it?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.809
How did this happen?

27:02.480 --> 27:06.769
The boys' locker room was flooded.
They found faeces everywhere.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.764
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.522
<i>Hey.</i>

27:30.600 --> 27:33.888
Has anyone ever told you that you're sexy?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.924
- I like your boobs.
- [Boys laugh]

27:37.000 --> 27:38.525
<i>Hey.</i>

27:39.360 --> 27:41.727
<i>Hey.</i>

27:41.800 --> 27:43.962
School's cancelled.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.322
Do you want to walk me home?

27:49.040 --> 27:51.168
Sure.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.086
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.886
Check your backpack.
Those guys love to steal shit.

28:09.840 --> 28:13.367
- Why did you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.762
My mom got a restraining order against my stepdad.

28:16.880 --> 28:21.920
- He has emotional problems.
- Me too. What kind does he have?

28:22.040 --> 28:25.283
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.130
Oh. Did he go to jail?

28:29.880 --> 28:32.929
No, he fled. They still can't find him.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.530
Mom and I had to change our names.
I thought Gretchen Ross was cool.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.841
I was in jail once.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.730
I accidentally burned down this house.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.922
It was abandoned, but still...

28:46.000 --> 28:50.369
I got held back in school,
I can't drive till I'm 21.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.046
But I'm over all of that. I...

28:53.120 --> 28:56.806
I'm painting and stuff. Writing.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.845
I want to be a writer. Maybe a painter.
Maybe both.

29:00.920 --> 29:04.242
I'll write a book and draw the pictures.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.882
Then maybe people will
understand me. Change things.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.849
Donnie Darko?

29:09.920 --> 29:14.687
What the hell kind of name is that?
It's like some sort of superhero.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.888
What makes you think I'm not?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.449
Look, I should go.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.285
Monnitoff wants me to write this physics essay.

29:26.360 --> 29:29.489
Greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.

29:30.880 --> 29:35.761
If it's Monnitoff, that's easy. Antiseptics.

29:35.880 --> 29:40.204
The whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.487
Before antiseptics there was no sanitation.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.246
- Especially in medicine.
- You mean soap?

29:53.280 --> 29:56.170
I'm really glad school was flooded today.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.322
Why's that?

29:58.440 --> 30:01.489
You and I would never have had this conversation.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.807
You're weird.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.689
Sorry.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.286
No, that was a compliment.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.161
Well, look, um...

30:17.440 --> 30:20.046
You wanna go with me?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.083
[Laughs nervously]

30:22.160 --> 30:24.242
Where do you wanna go?

30:24.320 --> 30:29.690
I mean, like, go with me. You know...
That's what we call it here.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.001
- Going together...
- Sure.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.046
OK. Where are you going?

30:39.960 --> 30:42.042
I'm going home.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.241
So stupid!

30:58.440 --> 31:01.364
I'd like to try something new this time.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.086
Have you ever been hypnotised?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.728
No.

31:18.280 --> 31:22.330
When I clap my hands twice, you
will wake up. Do you understand?

31:22.440 --> 31:24.249
Yes.

31:24.960 --> 31:28.601
So, tell me about your week.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.364
I met a girl.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.849
- What is her name?
- Gretchen.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.842
We're going together now.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.844
Do you still think about girls a lot?

31:46.560 --> 31:48.289
Yeah.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.842
How are things going at school?

31:54.800 --> 31:57.406
I think about girls a lot.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.131
I asked you about school, Donnie.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.881
I think about fucking a lot during school.

32:05.120 --> 32:08.044
What else do you think about during school?

32:08.120 --> 32:11.966
- <i>Married With Children.</i>
- Do <i>you</i> think <i>about your family?</i>

32:12.040 --> 32:17.251
I turn down the volume and think
about fucking Christina Applegate.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.164
I asked you about your family, Donnie.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.322
No. [Laughs]

32:22.400 --> 32:26.121
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.931
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.963
Sam Bylen.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.722
[Clears throat]

33:06.800 --> 33:08.689
Donald Darko.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.241
Daye Dennis.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.760
Hey, you fuck.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.525
Did you tell them I flooded the school?

33:46.840 --> 33:50.970
- I didn't say shit.
- They think I did it.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.203
If you're innocent, you have nothing to worry about.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.925
Fuck you! Know what I think?

33:59.800 --> 34:02.121
I think you did it.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.121
[Coughs]

34:17.040 --> 34:20.408
Beer and pussy. That's all I need.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.926
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.161
- Smurfette?
- Mm-hm.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.090
Not some tight-assed Middlesex chick.

34:28.159 --> 34:31.562
A cute little blonde that'll get
down and dirty with the guys.

34:31.719 --> 34:35.850
- Like Smurfette does.
- Smurfette doesn't fuck.

34:37.560 --> 34:41.645
Smurfette fucks the other smurfs.
Why did Papa Smurf make her?

34:41.719 --> 34:44.690
Because all the other smurfs were getting too horny.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.531
Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.

34:47.600 --> 34:51.889
OK, she fucks them while Vanity watches. OK?

34:51.960 --> 34:55.646
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get in on the action.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.371
He does. He films the gangbang.

34:58.440 --> 35:01.330
Later on he beats off to the tape.

35:02.560 --> 35:07.122
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create
Smurfette. Gargamel did.

35:07.200 --> 35:11.728
She was sent in as Gargamel's spy,
to destroy the smurf village.

35:11.800 --> 35:16.124
But the overwhelming goodness
of smurf life transformed her.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.965
And as for the whole gangbang scenario,

35:19.040 --> 35:21.566
it just couldn't happen.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.809
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have...

35:24.880 --> 35:28.248
reproductive organs under those little white pants.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.606
That's what's so illogical about being a smurf.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.365
What's the point of living

35:36.440 --> 35:38.647
if you don't have a click?

35:42.160 --> 35:45.369
Dammit, Donnie, why you gotta get
so smart on us?

35:45.440 --> 35:48.603
- [Car horn]
- Grandma Death.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.729
Excuse me! Excuse me!

35:52.760 --> 35:58.051
Stay off the road, Miss Sparrow.
I'll have to call social services.

35:58.160 --> 36:01.881
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.042
Yeah.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.690
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.766
She does the same thing every day.

36:11.840 --> 36:16.687
Just walks back and forth,
back and forth to the mailbox.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.480
And nothing ever in there.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.840
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.127
She's going back to the box.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.009
We may still have mail.

36:32.080 --> 36:34.560
- Mail, mail.
- Here it is.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.723
This could be it. Oh!

36:37.840 --> 36:40.491
No dice, Grandma. Sorry.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.608
Someone ought to write that bitch.

36:42.720 --> 36:45.121
<i>[TV announcer] Authorities continued their search</i>

36:45.200 --> 36:48.409
<i>for a suspect in the school vandalism.</i>

36:48.480 --> 36:53.168
<i>The school has asked for donations

36:53.240 --> 36:55.720
<i>known only as the Mongrel.</i>

37:01.280 --> 37:04.011
In cooperation with the county police,

37:04.080 --> 37:08.529
we have begun investigating
the cause of the flooding

37:08.600 --> 37:12.161
and our suspects include
several of our own students.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.802
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.128
[Breathing heavily]

37:26.160 --> 37:30.165
Kitty, I would appreciate
if you would wait...

37:30.240 --> 37:34.131
Dr. Cole, not only am I a teacher,

37:34.240 --> 37:37.562
but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.

37:37.640 --> 37:43.329
I am the only person here who
transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.006
<i>[Frank] Don't worry.</i>

37:49.640 --> 37:51.642
<i>You got away with it.</i>

37:51.720 --> 37:55.247
I have in my hand Graham Greene's The Destructors.

37:55.320 --> 38:00.201
This short story is part of
my daughter's English assignment.

38:00.280 --> 38:04.842
In this story, several children
destroy an elderly man's house

38:04.920 --> 38:06.809
from inside out.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.962
How can you do that?

38:25.240 --> 38:27.322
[Laughs nervously]

38:29.280 --> 38:31.362
And how do they do this?

38:31.440 --> 38:36.321
They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.523
<i>[Frank] I can do anything I want.</i>

38:41.680 --> 38:43.569
<i>And so can you.</i>

38:43.680 --> 38:47.002
We pay good money for this school.
It's our children.

38:47.080 --> 38:50.641
I think this garbage should be removed.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.609
Excuse me.

38:52.720 --> 38:55.530
What's the real issue?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

38:55.640 --> 39:01.761
The PTA is here to acknowledge
that pornography is being taught.

39:01.840 --> 39:07.529
- It's meant to be ironic.
- You need to go back to grad school.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.080
Why did you make me flood the school?

39:14.920 --> 39:17.366
They are in great danger.

39:17.440 --> 39:20.762
Kitty, do you even know who Graham Greene is?

39:20.840 --> 39:24.242
I think we have all seen Bonanza.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.483
Well, uh... while we are on other topics...

39:31.560 --> 39:33.881
Where did you come from?

39:35.600 --> 39:38.080
Do you believe in time travel?

39:40.600 --> 39:42.921
[Samantha] Who are you talking to?

39:46.880 --> 39:49.167
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.407
<i>[TV] It is time to breathe.</i>

40:01.560 --> 40:03.927
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

40:04.880 --> 40:07.121
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

40:08.400 --> 40:11.563
<i>Now let us begin lifeline exercise NO.1.</i>

40:11.640 --> 40:13.961
Please press stop <i>now.</i>

40:20.880 --> 40:26.728
As you can see, the lifeline is divided
into two polar extremes.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.201
Fear and love.

40:29.320 --> 40:33.211
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum

40:33.280 --> 40:36.807
and love is in the positive energy spectrum.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.201
- Duh!
- Excuse me?

40:39.320 --> 40:43.166
"Duh" is a product of fear.

40:44.400 --> 40:49.008
Now, on each card is a character dilemma

40:49.120 --> 40:51.646
which applies to the lifeline.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.480
Please... Take this.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.449
Thank you.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.410
Please read each character dilemma aloud

41:01.520 --> 41:05.969
and place an X on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.122
Cherita?

41:16.280 --> 41:19.489
"Juanita has an important math test today."

41:19.560 --> 41:24.009
"She has known about the test for
several weeks but has not studied."

41:24.080 --> 41:27.402
"In order to keep from failing her test,

41:27.480 --> 41:31.485
Juanita decides that she will cheat
on the math test."

41:34.720 --> 41:37.087
Good. Good. Very good.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.487
Um, Mr. Darko.

41:47.120 --> 41:49.885
"Ling Ling finds a wallet filled with money."

41:49.960 --> 41:54.807
"She takes the wallet to the address
inside but keeps the money."

41:54.880 --> 41:58.726
[Sighs] I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.844
Place an X in the appropriate place.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.402
No, I know what to do. I don't get this.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.165
You can't lump things into two categories.

42:08.240 --> 42:11.926
The lifeline is divided that way.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.610
Life isn't that simple.

42:13.760 --> 42:17.924
Who cares if Ling Ling returns
the wallet and keeps the money?

42:18.000 --> 42:20.685
It has nothing to do with fear or love.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.411
Fear and love are the deepest human emotions.

42:23.560 --> 42:26.166
OK. But you're not listening to me.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.050
Other things need to be taken into account.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.090
Like the whole spectrum of human emotion.

42:32.200 --> 42:36.683
You can't lump everything into two
categories and deny everything else.

42:36.760 --> 42:41.049
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero for the day.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.604
Donald.

42:47.720 --> 42:51.281
Let me preface this by saying that your Iowa Test scores

42:51.360 --> 42:55.160
are... intimidating.

42:57.240 --> 43:01.086
So... let's go over this again.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.607
What exactly did you say to Mrs. Farmer?

43:06.880 --> 43:08.962
I'll tell you what he said.

43:09.080 --> 43:12.971
He asked me to forcibly insert
the exercise card into my anus.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.088
[Laughs then coughs]

43:19.880 --> 43:23.930
[woman] These are modern times.
My political attitudes are forthright.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.723
If there's a vice presidential candidate
worthy of my vote, it's Dan Quayle.

43:29.800 --> 43:34.488
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

43:38.320 --> 43:40.368
Kitty...

43:40.440 --> 43:42.329
Excuse us, please.

43:46.560 --> 43:50.485
He's suspended from after-school
activities for six months.

43:53.520 --> 43:58.128
Ever since this jet engine fiasco
I don't know what's gotten into him.

43:58.200 --> 44:02.603
Rose, our daughters have been on
the dance team together for two years

44:02.680 --> 44:04.808
and I respect you as a woman.

44:04.880 --> 44:10.250
But after witnessing your son's
behaviour, I have doubts about your...

44:11.840 --> 44:14.650
Our paths through life must be righteous.

44:14.720 --> 44:18.008
I urge you to go home and look in the mirror,

44:18.120 --> 44:21.806
and pray that your son
doesn't succumb to the path of fear.

44:26.600 --> 44:31.970
[Elizabeth] Do you remember
that weird gym teacher Mrs. Farmer?

44:33.240 --> 44:34.810
Yeah.

44:34.880 --> 44:38.851
My brother told her to shove a book
up her ass today.

44:38.920 --> 44:42.925
And then my parents just bought him
all this new shit.

44:43.040 --> 44:47.204
I know. I wish a jet engine would fall in my room.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.564
<i>[Frank] I can show you the way.</i>

44:53.400 --> 44:55.482
[Bells chime]

44:58.920 --> 45:00.968
Yeah.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.122
[Boys laugh]

45:05.080 --> 45:07.242
- Dr. Monnitoff?
- Donnie.

45:07.320 --> 45:11.086
Um, I know this is gonna sound kinda weird, but uh...

45:11.200 --> 45:15.489
do you know anything about time travel?

45:19.880 --> 45:23.851
Ah! A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

45:23.920 --> 45:29.245
which is theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man.

45:31.600 --> 45:34.251
So, according to Hawking,

45:34.320 --> 45:37.642
a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut

45:37.720 --> 45:40.724
for jumping between
two distant regions of space time.

45:40.840 --> 45:42.490
So to travel back in time,

45:42.560 --> 45:46.042
you have to have a spaceship
that can travel faster than light.

45:46.120 --> 45:49.283
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

45:49.400 --> 45:51.687
The principles of time travel are there.

45:51.760 --> 45:53.842
You've got a vessel, a portal.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.611
The vessel can be anything.
Probably a spacecraft.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.405
- Like a DeLorean.
- Any metal craft.

45:59.480 --> 46:05.487
I love that movie, the way they shot it.
It's so futuristic, you know.

46:06.280 --> 46:10.569
Listen... don't tell anybody I gave you this.

46:10.640 --> 46:13.405
The woman who wrote this used to teach here.

46:13.480 --> 46:16.689
She was a nun many years before that.

46:16.760 --> 46:21.766
Then overnight she became
this entirely different person.

46:21.920 --> 46:25.367
She up and left the church, she wrote this book.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.721
She started teaching science.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.882
Right here in Middlesex.

46:30.840 --> 46:33.161
<i>The Philosophy Of Time Travel.</i>

46:34.680 --> 46:36.728
Roberta Sparrow?

46:36.800 --> 46:38.882
That's right.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.241
[Laughs] Come on.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.322
Roberta Sparrow.

47:03.840 --> 47:05.968
Roberta Sparrow...

47:07.520 --> 47:09.602
Grandma Death.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.205
<i>It's called The Philosophy Of Time Travel.</i>

47:14.360 --> 47:16.886
What does philosophy have to do with time travel?

47:16.960 --> 47:20.646
- Let me see.
- Guess who wrote it.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.768
Roberta Sparrow?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.968
Huh! She wrote a book!

47:25.040 --> 47:27.361
Grandma Death wrote a book.

47:28.040 --> 47:30.042
That's a terrible nickname.

47:30.880 --> 47:33.247
We almost hit her with the car.

47:33.840 --> 47:38.323
She lives in that piece of crap house
and you know she's loaded.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.681
- She's...
- You're right.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.923
She used to be known for her gem collection.

47:44.400 --> 47:50.043
Kids... used to go up there
and try to steal stuff from her.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.808
She became a total recluse.

47:53.560 --> 47:58.009
I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

48:02.600 --> 48:05.410
[Donny] She was standing in the road, frozen,

48:05.520 --> 48:10.321
so I got out of the car and
walked over to see if she was OK.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.926
She leaned over and whispered in my ear.

48:13.040 --> 48:16.806
- What did she say?
- Frank wants me to talk to her.

48:16.880 --> 48:20.362
He asked me if I knew about time travel.

48:20.440 --> 48:24.604
She wrote a book about it,
so it can't be a coincidence.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.127
What did Roberta Sparrow say to you?

48:32.280 --> 48:35.602
She said every creature on earth dies alone.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.848
How did that make you feel?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.571
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.361
She died when I was eight.

48:52.440 --> 48:56.001
She crawled underneath the porch.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.807
To die?

49:03.840 --> 49:05.968
To be alone.

49:07.120 --> 49:09.327
Do you feel alone right now?

49:14.600 --> 49:16.682
I...

49:18.680 --> 49:21.923
I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just...

49:22.920 --> 49:25.810
I've just never seen any proof, so I...

49:25.920 --> 49:28.446
I just don't debate it any more.

49:28.520 --> 49:31.683
I could spend my whole life debating it over and over

49:31.800 --> 49:34.201
and I still wouldn't have any proof,

49:34.320 --> 49:37.608
so I just... I just don't debate it any more.

49:37.680 --> 49:40.206
[Laughs] It's absurd.

49:43.840 --> 49:45.922
The search for God is absurd?

49:48.360 --> 49:50.647
It is if everyone dies alone.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.525
Does that scare you?

49:57.360 --> 49:59.522
I don't want to be alone.

50:12.880 --> 50:15.326
His tapes have made me realise

50:15.400 --> 50:20.566
that for the last 39 years I have been
a prisoner of my own fear.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.448
- Fear?
- [Sighs]

50:23.520 --> 50:26.808
Rose, you have got to meet this Jim Cunningham.

50:27.680 --> 50:29.921
I can't believe he's single.

50:30.680 --> 50:35.481
<i>[TV] It has been a disappointing night
for these Super Bowl champions.</i>

50:35.560 --> 50:40.327

50:40.400 --> 50:43.609

50:47.040 --> 50:49.486
<i>And it's no good.</i>

50:49.560 --> 50:52.689
We need a quarterback. And a miracle.

50:52.760 --> 50:54.922
We need to go for a safety.

51:00.160 --> 51:02.288
He sure does.

You guys want anything?

51:15.280 --> 51:17.362
I'm gonna get a beer.

[laughs]

52:59.040 --> 53:01.122
[aeroplane]

53:15.720 --> 53:18.451
What if you could go back in time

53:18.560 --> 53:23.566
and take all the pain and darkness
and replace it with something better?

53:23.640 --> 53:27.247
- Images?
- Yeah. Like a Hawaiian sunset

53:27.360 --> 53:31.365
or the Grand Canyon. Things
that remind you how beautiful...

53:31.440 --> 53:34.523
You know, we've been going together for two weeks.

53:34.600 --> 53:36.090
Yeah.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.203
Well, I uh...

53:42.920 --> 53:45.287
Do you wanna kiss me?

53:48.960 --> 53:50.689
Uh...

53:52.120 --> 53:55.363
- I... Sorry...
- Donnie, wait. I just...

53:55.480 --> 54:01.567
I just want it to be at a time when it...

54:01.640 --> 54:05.611
- When what?
- When it reminds me of...

54:07.280 --> 54:10.363
When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be?

54:10.440 --> 54:12.249
Yeah.

54:13.320 --> 54:16.961
And right now there's some fat guy staring at us.

54:23.880 --> 54:27.646
Thank you for seeing us at such late notice.

54:27.760 --> 54:32.084
We both felt it was time to come in and discuss...

54:32.200 --> 54:34.885
What I think is going on with your son?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.287
Yes.

54:37.360 --> 54:40.807
Um... Well, he's uh...

54:42.280 --> 54:46.444
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

54:46.520 --> 54:48.682
for insulting his gym teacher.

54:48.760 --> 54:53.368
I'm not sure that's a good example.
He had just cause to insult...

54:53.440 --> 54:57.684
Rose, let me just lay out
what I believe is happening here.

55:00.840 --> 55:04.162
Donnie's aggressive behaviour...

55:04.800 --> 55:08.566
his increased detachment from reality...

55:08.680 --> 55:12.685
seem to stem from his inability to cope

55:12.760 --> 55:16.924
with the forces in the world
that he perceives to be threatening.

55:21.920 --> 55:24.491
Has he ever told you about his friend Frank?

55:29.240 --> 55:31.527
Frank?

55:31.640 --> 55:33.483
The giant bunny rabbit.

55:34.320 --> 55:36.209
What?

55:40.160 --> 55:45.849
I don't recall him ever having mentioned a rabbit.

55:45.920 --> 55:50.926
Donnie is experiencing what is called
a daylight hallucination.

55:54.680 --> 55:58.480
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

56:00.560 --> 56:02.642
What can we do?

56:02.720 --> 56:06.930
I would like to do more hypnotherapy.

56:09.080 --> 56:11.401
And increase his medication.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.922
[Thunderclap]

56:18.040 --> 56:23.604
Whatever will help him, really,
because that's why we're here.

56:23.680 --> 56:28.766
We just would like him to experience some... relief.

56:28.840 --> 56:33.687
So if you think that more medication will do that,

56:33.760 --> 56:38.129
then I think we should give it a try.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.531
[Bells chime]

56:50.880 --> 56:52.928
Donnie Darko.

56:55.800 --> 56:57.848
I know.

56:57.920 --> 57:00.651
[Both laugh]

57:01.840 --> 57:03.763
[music and applause]

57:07.040 --> 57:09.930
- Good morning, you Mongrels.
- Good morning.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.083
Is that all the gusto you can muster?
Good morning!

57:13.200 --> 57:15.328
Good morning.

57:15.400 --> 57:17.721
Now, that's a tiny bit better.

57:17.800 --> 57:23.204
But I can sense some students
who are afraid to say good morning.

57:23.280 --> 57:25.408
[Students] Good morning!

57:25.480 --> 57:27.448
That's what I like to hear!

57:27.560 --> 57:30.530
Entirely too many
young men and women today

57:30.600 --> 57:33.649
are completely paralysed by their fears.

57:33.800 --> 57:38.601
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

57:38.720 --> 57:41.769
of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.

57:42.680 --> 57:46.730
Now, I'm gonna tell you a little story today.

57:46.840 --> 57:48.968
It's a heartbreakingly sad story

57:49.040 --> 57:53.329
about a young man
whose life was completely destroyed

57:53.400 --> 57:55.607
by these instruments of fear.

57:55.720 --> 58:01.090
A young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

58:01.840 --> 58:04.207
His name was Frank.

58:08.920 --> 58:13.369
Um, my stepsister...
I sometimes worry that she eats too much.

58:13.440 --> 58:16.091
- Shut up, Kim.
- Sweetheart, please.

58:16.160 --> 58:20.643
- What can I do when I grow up?
- That's a hard one.

58:20.720 --> 58:22.802
How do I learn how to fight?

58:22.880 --> 58:25.884
"How do I learn how to fight?"

58:25.960 --> 58:30.284
Son, violence is a product of fear.

58:30.400 --> 58:33.529
- Learn to truly love yourself.
- OK.

58:33.600 --> 58:35.967
- Get up here.
- OK.

58:36.040 --> 58:38.202
All right.

58:40.320 --> 58:43.403
- Good morning.
- [Jim] Good morning.

58:43.520 --> 58:46.490
Um, how much are they paying you
to be here?

58:48.000 --> 58:49.525
Excuse me?

58:51.720 --> 58:53.324
What is your name, son?

58:53.400 --> 58:55.289
Gerald.

58:55.360 --> 58:58.443
Gerald, I think you're afraid.

58:58.520 --> 59:03.970
Are you telling us this so we buy your
book? It's the worst advice I heard.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.929
You see how sad this is?

59:06.000 --> 59:11.769
Want your sister to lose weight? Tell
her to get off the couch and exercise.

59:11.880 --> 59:15.009
No-one knows what to do when they grow up.

59:15.080 --> 59:18.766
It takes a while to find that out. Right, Jim?

59:18.840 --> 59:20.888
And you.

59:20.960 --> 59:22.962
Yeah, you.

59:23.080 --> 59:26.129
You sick of some jerk picking on you?

59:26.200 --> 59:29.602
Maybe you should lift weights or do karate.

59:29.720 --> 59:32.485
Next time he tries, kick him in the balls.

59:32.560 --> 59:33.641
[Gasps]

59:33.720 --> 59:35.529
[Jim laughs] Son.
