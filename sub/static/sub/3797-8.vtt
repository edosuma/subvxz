01:23.743 --> 01:26.611
<i>Over there.
Maybe a bit to the left.</i>

01:26.613 --> 01:28.780
<i>Hold the ladder steady, though.</i>

01:28.782 --> 01:30.448
It certainly is.

01:30.499 --> 01:32.784
All right, well, I'll meet
you at noon, then, yes?

01:32.835 --> 01:35.036
Till then.

01:35.087 --> 01:36.454
Good morning, deputy.

01:36.456 --> 01:37.956
<i>We're not ceding anything.</i>

01:37.958 --> 01:39.624
<i>It can be handled
expeditiously.</i>

01:39.675 --> 01:42.127
There's a problem we should
be able to make go away.

01:42.129 --> 01:44.346
Do you have a moment, sir?

01:48.884 --> 01:51.186
What's your suggestion?

01:51.220 --> 01:53.305
2,000 will settle it.

01:53.356 --> 01:56.391
1,200. They can take
it or leave it.

01:58.027 --> 01:59.978
I will let them know.

02:03.482 --> 02:04.983
Well?

02:05.034 --> 02:07.152
I wanted to speak with you.

02:07.203 --> 02:08.620
About the sheriff.

02:08.654 --> 02:12.157
There isn't a sheriff.
Not right now.

02:12.159 --> 02:14.409
I believe
I'd be well-suited.

02:14.460 --> 02:17.329
- Why is that?
- I know what's required.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.964
And I'm ready to work
as hard as necessary.

02:23.002 --> 02:27.472
What do you think it says on
Cornelius Vanderbilt's headstone?

02:27.506 --> 02:28.840
Something in Latin?

02:28.891 --> 02:31.509
Whatever it is, it doesn't
say he worked hard.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.845
It's what you leave behind.

02:33.896 --> 02:36.848
That's the only thing anyone's
ever gonna know about you.

02:36.899 --> 02:38.683
Then you should be proud.

02:38.685 --> 02:41.069
For what?
Wooden hotels?

02:41.103 --> 02:43.154
Rolling carts?

02:43.189 --> 02:44.989
Salt water from the spigots?

02:45.024 --> 02:47.108
One bad storm
would wash it all away.

02:47.159 --> 02:49.694
You put everything in place.

02:49.696 --> 02:51.663
You made everyone pay.

02:51.697 --> 02:54.833
If there's a problem,
that problem gets solved.

02:54.867 --> 02:57.335
I admire you for that.

02:59.171 --> 03:02.674
Always an eager little boy.

03:03.793 --> 03:06.177
I'm not a boy anymore.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.464
You married?

03:09.515 --> 03:10.849
Yes.

03:10.883 --> 03:13.351
- Children?
- Soon, God willing.

03:13.386 --> 03:15.854
They get in the way.

03:15.888 --> 03:18.189
- I see it differently.
- See it how you like.

03:18.224 --> 03:19.724
In the end,

03:19.775 --> 03:22.560
we do what we have
the nerve for or we disappear.

03:22.562 --> 03:24.562
Haven't I shown you that?

03:24.613 --> 03:25.814
You ran an errand.

03:25.865 --> 03:27.732
<i>You said it was
a personal matter.</i>

03:27.783 --> 03:29.818
And I kept it quiet.

03:36.459 --> 03:38.410
Are you threatening me?

03:38.461 --> 03:41.045
Is that what
you think you're doing?

03:42.081 --> 03:44.382
I'm telling you that I'm loyal

03:44.417 --> 03:46.501
and ready to be of use.

03:46.552 --> 03:49.421
<i>Commodore Kaestner.</i>

03:49.423 --> 03:51.055
I'm sorry to disturb.

03:51.090 --> 03:53.792
The children have prepared something.
May they recite for you?

03:53.826 --> 03:56.928
Oh, nothing could
delight me more.

04:03.686 --> 04:07.605
"Ah! What pleasant
visions haunt me

04:07.656 --> 04:10.108
as I gaze upon the sea!"

04:10.110 --> 04:13.278
<i>All the old romantic legends,</i>

04:13.280 --> 04:16.113
<i>all my dreams, come back to me.</i>

04:16.116 --> 04:19.617
<i>Sails of silk
and ropes of sandal,</i>

04:19.619 --> 04:22.754
<i>such as gleam in ancient lore;</i>

04:22.788 --> 04:24.172
<i>"and the singing"...</i>

04:24.206 --> 04:26.624
Political posturing aside,
it's simply a matter

04:26.626 --> 04:28.042
of upholding the constitution.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.178
Which, as we know,
can be amended.

04:30.212 --> 04:31.579
You're being an alarmist.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.631
There can be no national
security otherwise.

04:33.633 --> 04:35.016
It doesn't matter
what the wets are saying.

04:35.050 --> 04:36.801
It's the wets and drys alike.

04:36.852 --> 04:40.021
The word on the hill is repeal
is not going to happen.

04:40.055 --> 04:41.890
Where are you getting
this claptrap?

04:41.941 --> 04:43.525
Straight from
the horse's mouth.

04:43.559 --> 04:46.144
- Hoover?
- He said horse, not jackass.

04:46.146 --> 04:48.980
The chairman of the republican
national committee.

04:48.982 --> 04:52.317
In 18 months, Simeon Fess will
be standing on a breadline.

04:52.319 --> 04:54.969
- Not with the Republicans in charge.
- Hoover's a lame duck.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.988
His poll numbers
are through the roof, Joe.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.324
Among the wealthy, and there
are damn few of those.

04:59.326 --> 05:00.764
It's Roosevelt, boys.

05:00.826 --> 05:02.894
Prohibition's over. You can
take that to the bank.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.880
I come as a friend.
I've said my piece.

05:05.915 --> 05:07.665
Good luck to you, gentlemen.

05:07.667 --> 05:09.467
This way, senator.

05:11.787 --> 05:13.622
I say we cut and run.

05:13.673 --> 05:16.708
Mayflower's entire valuation
is tied to repeal.

05:16.759 --> 05:20.212
Sell in blocks of 5,000
so we don't spook the street.

05:20.214 --> 05:22.347
Where...
Where are we today?

05:22.381 --> 05:23.848
331/8, sir.

05:23.883 --> 05:25.934
Highest our shares
have been in a decade.

05:25.968 --> 05:28.720
They'll be even higher
if we just hold firm.

05:28.771 --> 05:30.772
And worthless if repeal
doesn't happen.

05:30.806 --> 05:33.191
I'm with you. I say get out
while the getting is good.

05:33.226 --> 05:36.228
Gentlemen, please.
Let's keep stiff upper lips.

05:36.230 --> 05:38.730
Is that what they taught you
over there in England?

05:40.783 --> 05:42.867
Just hold steady for 24 hours

05:42.902 --> 05:44.953
while I sort this out.

05:46.205 --> 05:47.572
Agreed?

05:53.212 --> 05:55.163
Them ledgers were took
by, what do you call it?

05:55.214 --> 05:56.748
False pretenses.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.383
Don't that count for nothing?

05:58.417 --> 05:59.968
You said you gave them to him.

06:00.002 --> 06:01.920
Well, we wouldn't have
had we knew he was a fed.

06:01.922 --> 06:03.638
D'Angelo wasn't even
his real name.

06:03.673 --> 06:06.091
Malone.
A fucking irishman.

06:06.093 --> 06:07.592
That's what hurts the most.

06:07.643 --> 06:09.594
We need to focus
on what's to come.

06:09.645 --> 06:13.265
What's to come is I'm gonna
use this to wipe my ass.

06:13.267 --> 06:17.852
Those ledgers detail various streams
of revenue for five years running.

06:17.903 --> 06:20.105
So call the mayor. He'll
have it squashed in no time.

06:20.107 --> 06:21.439
<i>This is federal, Al.</i>

06:21.490 --> 06:23.942
Over $2 million
in unclaimed income.

06:23.944 --> 06:26.027
<i>- Peanuts.
- It's tax evasion.</i>

06:26.078 --> 06:27.445
No, it's a joke is what it is.

06:27.496 --> 06:30.782
They've agreed to give you 24
hours to turn yourself in.

06:30.784 --> 06:34.035
- Now, I strongly suggest...
- What the fuck do I pay you for?

06:34.086 --> 06:37.038
Huh?
Make some calls.

06:37.089 --> 06:39.174
Grease some palms. Deal
with it, for Christ sakes.

06:42.211 --> 06:43.928
Why don't you give us a minute?

06:51.887 --> 06:55.140
- What if he's right, snork?
- He's running the meter, that's all.

06:55.142 --> 06:58.560
These fucking lawyers, they'd turn a
parking ticket into a murder charge.

06:58.611 --> 07:00.979
I've dealt with these tax pricks.

07:00.981 --> 07:02.480
They're a bunch
of hard-asses.

07:02.531 --> 07:04.866
We'll be fine.
Will you relax, huh?

07:04.900 --> 07:07.869
I can beat this.
We'll buy the judge, huh?

07:07.903 --> 07:09.871
Spread the cash around.
I'll be in and out.

07:09.905 --> 07:12.657
- I guess that'll work.
- Oh, you guess. You guess.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.626
I ever let you down before?

07:14.660 --> 07:16.494
- No.
- Good.

07:16.545 --> 07:19.881
There's something much more important
I want to talk to you about.

07:22.301 --> 07:24.469
You think Marlene
Dietrich's a dyke?

07:25.838 --> 07:28.306
There you go.
There's a smile.

07:28.341 --> 07:30.975
Come on. Let's have some drinks.
Come on, look lively.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.645
Capone, Mangano, Profaci,

07:33.679 --> 07:35.680
Bonanno, Gagliano.

07:35.731 --> 07:37.315
Those types of cheeses?

07:37.350 --> 07:39.234
You want Magaddino
down from buffalo?

07:39.268 --> 07:41.353
Buffalo mozzerel.
I was right.

07:41.355 --> 07:43.488
Invite them all.
See who shows.

07:43.522 --> 07:45.106
Whoever don't gets popped.

07:45.157 --> 07:46.858
Easy.

07:51.697 --> 07:52.947
Good.

08:00.039 --> 08:01.956
10 years ago,

08:02.007 --> 08:03.425
more maybe,

08:03.459 --> 08:05.210
<i>right before prohibition,</i>

08:05.212 --> 08:07.429
<i>went down to
Atlantic City with A.R.</i>

08:07.463 --> 08:09.514
<i>Had dinner at some hotel.</i>

08:09.548 --> 08:12.684
Me, him, big Jim Colosimo,

08:12.718 --> 08:14.719
<i>Nucky Thompson.</i>

08:14.721 --> 08:17.889
I remember thinking,

08:17.923 --> 08:19.724
"I'm with
the big boys now."

08:19.759 --> 08:22.527
<i>- You were a baby.
- We all were.</i>

08:22.561 --> 08:25.063
Now look at us.

08:42.414 --> 08:44.916
Anybody ain't on board,

08:44.918 --> 08:47.051
and I mean anybody,

08:47.086 --> 08:48.970
they fucking go.

08:49.004 --> 08:51.506
That scumbag Waxey Gordon,
Dutch Schultz,

08:51.557 --> 08:54.008
that spook in Harlem, Narcisse.

08:54.059 --> 08:56.895
<i>- Johnny Torrio.
- Why you sore at him?</i>

08:56.929 --> 08:59.814
I'm not.
Just deadweight.

08:59.849 --> 09:02.400
All about moving
forward, ain't it?

09:04.437 --> 09:06.771
I can't tell you how urgent this is.

09:06.773 --> 09:09.991
- I must have it by 4:00.
- Here it is, Lucy. Give it to bagner.

09:10.025 --> 09:12.444
Mr. Kennedy.
What an honor.

09:13.412 --> 09:14.863
Welcome to Conors & gould.

09:14.914 --> 09:16.698
How may we help you today?

09:19.869 --> 09:21.619
Mrs. Thompson.

09:21.670 --> 09:24.456
Just what in the bloody
hell is going on here?

09:24.507 --> 09:26.207
Mr. Kennedy.

09:26.258 --> 09:28.843
I was under the impression
a gentleman called first.

09:28.878 --> 09:32.630
You're shorting my firm's
stock, you and your husband.

09:32.632 --> 09:35.467
We don't discuss orders
we place for clients.

09:35.518 --> 09:38.970
Which of your clients is twisting
the arm of senator Lloyd?

09:39.021 --> 09:41.189
I have no idea who that is.

09:41.223 --> 09:44.025
Your husband does, and
he's trying to screw me.

09:44.059 --> 09:45.977
You'll pardon my candor,

09:45.979 --> 09:49.030
but I prefer to do
the screwing myself.

09:49.064 --> 09:51.816
I'm sure no one would
accuse you otherwise,

09:51.818 --> 09:54.202
but my husband has nothing
to do with this.

09:54.236 --> 09:55.820
You're the mastermind?

09:55.822 --> 09:59.040
All I know is what
I read in the papers.

09:59.074 --> 10:02.160
It won't work.

10:02.211 --> 10:04.354
My partners will
stay the course

10:04.355 --> 10:06.498
whatever your client
told Lloyd to say.

10:06.549 --> 10:09.467
Mayflower grain, 291/4.

10:09.502 --> 10:12.921
Down nearly three points
in the last hour.

10:12.972 --> 10:14.756
I'm no expert,

10:14.807 --> 10:18.426
but I'd say your partners
are selling in increments.

10:20.012 --> 10:23.481
I'll tell them what you're
doing, shore the price back up.

10:23.516 --> 10:26.351
But they're already
selling behind your back.

10:28.988 --> 10:31.356
You could sell yourself.

10:31.407 --> 10:33.358
Unload your entire position,

10:33.360 --> 10:36.528
then sell short
along with my client.

10:38.197 --> 10:39.531
Beg pardon?

10:39.582 --> 10:41.833
Investors such as yourself
often keep accounts

10:41.867 --> 10:43.368
under assumed names.

10:43.370 --> 10:47.005
Cash out in one,
sell short in another.

10:47.039 --> 10:48.873
Who'd know better
than a senator?

10:48.875 --> 10:51.125
If you assure
your partners he's right,

10:51.176 --> 10:52.627
that repeal is not possible...

10:52.678 --> 10:54.462
They'll bail completely
and an hour later

10:54.513 --> 10:56.347
Mayflower stock
will be in the dumper.

10:56.382 --> 10:58.550
Then you and my client
buy back,

10:58.552 --> 11:01.719
closing the short position
simultaneously.

11:01.770 --> 11:04.622
Which is all perfectly legal.

11:07.359 --> 11:09.561
I need to call my broker.

11:11.230 --> 11:13.481
It's complimentary.

11:45.097 --> 11:47.265
Mabel?

11:57.693 --> 11:59.744
I should have picked that up.

11:59.778 --> 12:01.329
What's wrong?

12:01.363 --> 12:04.332
Nothing.
I was at the school.

12:04.366 --> 12:08.503
I was unwell, so I came home.

12:08.537 --> 12:10.288
And it happened here.

12:10.339 --> 12:13.458
- What did?
- A mishap.

12:13.460 --> 12:16.260
But it passed quickly.
No need for the doctor.

12:17.796 --> 12:20.632
Are you talking about the baby?

12:20.634 --> 12:22.467
Too soon for that.

12:22.518 --> 12:24.602
Is the baby all right?

12:24.637 --> 12:26.137
Not a baby.

12:26.139 --> 12:28.106
Just a mishap.

12:28.140 --> 12:31.726
- The doctor has to...
- No. No.

12:31.777 --> 12:34.562
It's passed.

12:36.148 --> 12:37.699
Why didn't you send for me?

12:37.733 --> 12:40.702
I don't know where you are.

12:40.736 --> 12:43.037
I don't know when you're home.

12:43.072 --> 12:44.872
And what would you have done?

12:46.659 --> 12:49.627
I've washed.
I'm fine.

12:49.662 --> 12:51.879
I can go back
to class in a bit.

12:51.914 --> 12:53.381
I've left edwina in charge.

12:53.415 --> 12:55.717
She can't cope
with them at all.

12:58.170 --> 12:59.504
I'm sorry.

12:59.555 --> 13:01.639
What are you sorry about?

13:01.674 --> 13:03.224
You can't be all right.

13:03.258 --> 13:05.893
I am.

13:05.928 --> 13:08.062
Really.

13:09.148 --> 13:11.182
Why are you sorry?

13:14.603 --> 13:16.988
I worked for this.

13:18.574 --> 13:21.526
Everything for this.

13:24.196 --> 13:26.330
I love you.

13:27.616 --> 13:29.534
I disappoint you.

13:29.568 --> 13:33.504
Whatever I do.
Don't I?

13:43.682 --> 13:45.633
I should put salt on that.

13:45.718 --> 13:49.020
Please tell me
that you're all right.

13:54.309 --> 13:56.277
It might be business.

13:56.311 --> 13:57.695
Nuck!

13:57.730 --> 14:00.732
<i>- Looking all over for you.
- What do you want?</i>

14:00.734 --> 14:02.700
Ma needs you.

14:09.158 --> 14:12.160
<i>G.E., 261/2!</i>

14:12.211 --> 14:14.746
<i>Mayflower, 153/4.</i>

14:16.048 --> 14:17.582
Sell 2,000 shares of Mayflower.

14:17.633 --> 14:21.052
- Limit or market?
- Market, damn it. Do it now!

14:21.887 --> 14:23.721
<i>Westinghouse, seven.</i>

14:23.756 --> 14:25.339
<i>Mayflower, 141/2.</i>

14:25.390 --> 14:28.009
Down another dollar and a half.
Let's close it up.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.761
Not yet.

14:29.812 --> 14:32.346
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

14:32.397 --> 14:35.016
We're going to see, aren't we?

14:35.067 --> 14:37.068
<i>Mayflower, 11.</i>

14:37.102 --> 14:38.903
Go sell.

14:38.937 --> 14:40.021
Boy! Boy!

14:40.072 --> 14:42.290
<i>93/8!</i>

14:42.324 --> 14:45.159
It's under 10 now. Even without
repeal, it's worth twice that.

14:45.194 --> 14:46.944
It hasn't found the bottom yet.

14:46.995 --> 14:49.080
Oh, to hell with this.
It's going back up.

14:49.114 --> 14:50.615
- Boy.
- Wait!

14:50.666 --> 14:53.868
<i>71/8. 61/2.</i>

14:53.919 --> 14:56.287
<i>53/4!</i>

14:56.289 --> 14:58.623
<i>Westinghouse, 81/4.</i>

14:58.674 --> 15:00.591
I want... ah!
Get off me!

15:00.626 --> 15:03.377
Get off of me!

15:06.131 --> 15:11.302
<i>- Mayflower, 53/4.
- 191/8.</i>

15:11.304 --> 15:13.938
This is a dangerous
game you're playing.

15:13.972 --> 15:16.190
Mrs. Thompson!

15:17.893 --> 15:19.777
Mrs. Thompson.

15:22.781 --> 15:24.982
Now.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.150
Buy to cover immediately.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.069
Close these short
positions in Mayflower.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.071
Go!

15:35.160 --> 15:37.995
Three things are
difficult to understand.

15:37.997 --> 15:40.214
The work of the bees,

15:40.249 --> 15:42.583
the movements of the tide,

15:42.634 --> 15:44.418
and the mind of a woman.

15:44.469 --> 15:47.505
Here is an experiment for you.

15:47.507 --> 15:49.724
Think about the things
you want in life,

15:49.758 --> 15:51.759
and then picture
yourself in a dress.

15:56.348 --> 15:58.983
You've just made some money.

16:00.769 --> 16:03.321
Then let me shake your hand.

16:05.357 --> 16:07.408
You were sweating.

16:07.442 --> 16:08.993
Weren't you?

16:11.413 --> 16:14.332
There's a lot
we could do together.

16:14.366 --> 16:17.001
I was just thinking
the same thing.

16:17.035 --> 16:20.204
How would you like to proceed?

16:21.673 --> 16:23.791
Come see me
during office hours.

16:23.842 --> 16:26.627
The firm would love
to have your business.

16:34.553 --> 16:36.220
A reporter came by
from the "tribune."

16:36.222 --> 16:38.806
- Asked a lot of questions.
- When, today?

16:38.857 --> 16:40.558
Give me his name.
It won't happen again.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.610
He said there were rumors.

16:42.644 --> 16:45.029
They're washwomen,
these fellas.

16:45.063 --> 16:45.997
Pay them no mind.

16:45.998 --> 16:47.865
I'd feel a lot better
if you went to mass.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.985
- Talk to Father Brigandi.
- Ain't I got enough agita?

16:51.036 --> 16:53.154
- What if something happens?
- Nothing's gonna happen.

16:53.205 --> 16:54.705
I mean, Jesus, between
you and my brother...

16:54.740 --> 16:57.325
I need you to tell me
what to do.

16:58.744 --> 17:01.662
Make coffee is what
you should do.

17:26.570 --> 17:28.940
Hey, pal.

17:28.991 --> 17:31.909
Hey.
What you reading?

17:37.783 --> 17:40.618
Lewis and Clark.
Explorers, right?

17:43.672 --> 17:46.540
I need to talk to you.

17:50.379 --> 17:53.130
Come on. Sit up.
Come on. Sit.

17:58.270 --> 18:02.890
I may be going away
for a while, Sonny.

18:02.941 --> 18:05.810
You understand?

18:05.812 --> 18:07.778
Not like a vacation

18:07.813 --> 18:10.398
where I come back
in a couple of weeks.

18:12.617 --> 18:15.119
I did some bad things.

18:15.153 --> 18:17.488
And now I'm in trouble.

18:18.824 --> 18:21.375
I will help you.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.828
You'll help me?

18:25.797 --> 18:27.748
It ain't that kind
of thing, buddy.

18:27.799 --> 18:30.334
You can't help me with this.

18:30.336 --> 18:33.504
You need to listen
to your mother.

18:33.506 --> 18:34.922
You understand?

18:36.925 --> 18:40.344
You keep to your lessons.
Be a good boy.

18:43.515 --> 18:47.818
Remember, all I did
was for you.

18:47.853 --> 18:50.938
To leave you
with something better.

18:50.989 --> 18:53.908
And that can't be for nothing.

19:03.618 --> 19:05.870
Dad.

19:12.377 --> 19:15.546
Come here.

19:17.466 --> 19:19.633
<i>With steel
production slipping at a rate</i>

19:19.684 --> 19:21.886
<i>of nearly 2% per week.</i>

19:21.937 --> 19:23.888
<i>In a speech today</i>

19:23.939 --> 19:26.023
<i>during a New York
athletic club luncheon,</i>

19:26.058 --> 19:28.559
<i>governor Roosevelt
once again made clear</i>

19:28.561 --> 19:32.029
<i>his intention to support
the repeal of the Volstead act.</i>

19:32.064 --> 19:34.899
<i>The governor's remarks
sent the market into turmoil</i>

19:34.950 --> 19:37.451
<i>with grain stocks
plummeting abruptly,</i>

19:37.486 --> 19:41.455
<i>but all recovering
by the closing bell.</i>

19:41.490 --> 19:44.575
<i>In baseball, Jim Weaver
led the Yankees</i>

19:44.577 --> 19:48.162
<i>to a 3-2 victory over
the Philadelphia athletics.</i>

19:50.416 --> 19:51.715
How did it go?

19:51.750 --> 19:54.819
You haven't been following?

19:54.853 --> 19:56.754
No.

19:58.006 --> 20:00.991
You've done well.
Very well, I'd say.

20:01.026 --> 20:03.144
I'm glad to hear it.

20:04.429 --> 20:07.098
Don't you want
to know how much?

20:07.132 --> 20:09.433
If you'd like to tell me.

20:09.435 --> 20:14.321
$2,364,120.

20:14.356 --> 20:16.974
- That's a lot.
- That's quite a lot.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.544
Did you take my advice?

20:20.579 --> 20:23.380
I'm just asking.

20:23.415 --> 20:25.983
I haven't your appetite
for danger.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.685
So you didn't?

20:27.719 --> 20:29.887
1,000 shares.

20:29.921 --> 20:33.290
$29,925.

20:33.341 --> 20:35.009
Not bad for a day's work.

20:35.043 --> 20:37.945
Dodgy way of making money.

20:37.979 --> 20:39.763
You're awfully good at it.

20:41.766 --> 20:44.135
Will you be renting this?

20:45.971 --> 20:48.522
It's more than I need.

20:49.724 --> 20:51.475
I don't know.

20:51.526 --> 20:53.110
There's a one-bedroom
upstairs.

20:53.145 --> 20:54.778
Bigger terrace.

20:54.813 --> 20:57.715
You're not much for outdoors.

20:57.749 --> 21:00.868
<i>Nice to know
it's there, though.</i>

21:03.371 --> 21:05.372
What will you do
with your money?

21:06.458 --> 21:08.909
Do you have any advice?

21:10.829 --> 21:12.830
I was a bellboy.

21:12.832 --> 21:15.232
Carried people's bags.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.301
First time I was
tipped a nickel,

21:17.335 --> 21:20.671
I thought the world
is a marvelous place.

21:21.973 --> 21:26.110
But a dime,
a dime would be better.

21:26.144 --> 21:30.397
And when I got the dime,
I thought a quarter.

21:39.908 --> 21:42.576
My circumstances have changed.

21:43.828 --> 21:48.499
There are things
I won't do anymore.

21:48.567 --> 21:50.951
You understand that, don't you?

21:52.037 --> 21:54.288
There's what I know,

21:54.339 --> 21:56.924
what I suspect,

21:56.958 --> 21:59.810
and what I don't think
I should ever hear.

21:59.844 --> 22:03.180
Am I supposed to say I'm sorry?

22:03.215 --> 22:05.316
It's not in your nature.

22:05.350 --> 22:08.919
Besides, all you did was offer.

22:08.954 --> 22:11.255
I was the one who took.

22:14.559 --> 22:16.894
Do you like this place?

22:19.614 --> 22:22.333
13 stops closer to downtown.

22:23.735 --> 22:25.569
What does that mean?

22:25.571 --> 22:27.404
I'm not sure.

22:27.406 --> 22:29.373
But I said it.

22:31.610 --> 22:35.246
We danced once, didn't we?

23:23.462 --> 23:27.298
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought...

23:27.300 --> 23:29.350
We were just taking a look.

23:29.384 --> 23:30.851
Not to worry.
Not to worry.

23:30.885 --> 23:32.219
You see how popular it is.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.772
- Do you mind if we...
- Not at all.

23:34.806 --> 23:38.309
This is my favorite line
in the building.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.894
Three bedrooms,
maid's room, study,

23:40.945 --> 23:43.731
and, of course, that view.

23:43.782 --> 23:45.532
The Eldorado is designed

23:45.567 --> 23:48.319
to be the finest apartment
residence in the city.

23:48.370 --> 23:50.871
The very best
that life has to offer.

23:50.905 --> 23:52.823
Will you folks
be bringing family?

23:59.731 --> 24:01.632
<i>Ask me, he goes tonight.</i>

24:01.666 --> 24:03.300
Should have did it weeks ago.

24:03.335 --> 24:04.718
It's not like we didn't try.

24:04.753 --> 24:07.304
All over New York
running his fucking mouth.

24:07.339 --> 24:09.723
You surprised?

24:09.758 --> 24:12.092
Your third whiskey in an hour.

24:12.143 --> 24:14.144
Don't clock me, Meyer.

24:15.347 --> 24:18.015
<i>Is it the meeting?</i>

24:18.066 --> 24:20.317
First time in the big seat.

24:20.352 --> 24:22.269
Fuck that.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.823
What do you want to do
about our friend?

24:29.577 --> 24:31.945
Two shooters.
In public.

24:31.996 --> 24:33.747
<i>So people know.</i>

24:36.584 --> 24:37.918
Understood.

24:37.952 --> 24:39.536
No misses,
no fuck-ups.

24:39.587 --> 24:41.672
<i>I want it all cleaned up
before the meeting.</i>

24:41.706 --> 24:44.458
I said I'll take care
of it, Meyer.

25:09.651 --> 25:11.985
She brings a bicycle.

25:12.036 --> 25:14.872
She just rides around
every day.

25:14.906 --> 25:16.707
- That's fantastic.
- Every morning. I know.

25:16.741 --> 25:18.826
Every morning
she just rides around.

25:18.877 --> 25:21.078
My father used to
call that constitution.

25:21.129 --> 25:23.580
That's right.
That's exactly what it is.

25:29.587 --> 25:31.388
Do you know who I am?

25:32.924 --> 25:34.725
Some sort of genie?

25:36.177 --> 25:39.279
I'm from the future. Shh.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.616
What brings you
to Atlantic City?

25:42.667 --> 25:45.736
I have a message for you.
Would you like to hear it?

25:45.770 --> 25:48.238
What message?

26:06.124 --> 26:08.625
- What's inside?
- The world to come.

26:09.761 --> 26:11.128
Does it include you?

26:11.130 --> 26:14.465
I'll be there,
but I won't be there.

26:16.468 --> 26:18.268
I don't understand.

26:18.303 --> 26:21.688
The only way to knowledge
is through experience.

26:25.810 --> 26:27.611
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

26:40.325 --> 26:42.242
I can't see anything.

26:45.497 --> 26:47.414
Miss?

27:02.564 --> 27:05.482
<i>♪ twinkle,

27:05.517 --> 27:08.185

27:22.333 --> 27:24.034
Found him, ma.

27:31.209 --> 27:33.126
I didn't want to trouble you.

27:33.177 --> 27:35.212
It's no trouble.

27:35.214 --> 27:38.549
- There's something on the stove.
- Hold on, ma.

27:42.053 --> 27:44.771
He isn't himself when he drinks.
You know that.

27:44.806 --> 27:47.891
- Where is he?
- He's... Enoch.

27:52.981 --> 27:55.282
Pop, Nucky's here.

27:55.316 --> 27:57.901
Get up.

27:57.903 --> 28:00.203
I said get up.

28:06.878 --> 28:08.795
<i>No welcome for trespassers.</i>

28:08.830 --> 28:10.247
He's not trespassing, pop.

28:10.298 --> 28:12.082
He don't live here.

28:12.133 --> 28:14.501
You hit her again?

28:14.552 --> 28:15.802
Accident.

28:15.837 --> 28:17.387
One too many.

28:17.422 --> 28:19.890
<i>- Says who?
- Deputy sheriff.</i>

28:21.843 --> 28:25.145
<i>- That amuses you?
- You amuse me.</i>

28:25.179 --> 28:27.347
Blue wool, your shiny buttons.

28:27.398 --> 28:29.733
That's the uniform, pop.
He has to wear it.

28:36.274 --> 28:38.275
- How about now?
- You don't want to start.

28:38.326 --> 28:40.527
<i>Why not?</i>

28:40.578 --> 28:42.529
I got the gun.

28:43.915 --> 28:45.415
Ethan.

28:45.450 --> 28:48.669
<i>He's your son.</i>

28:52.724 --> 28:54.508
<i>- Nuck.
- Enoch.</i>

28:58.796 --> 29:00.514
You're scared.

29:00.548 --> 29:03.100
So are you.

29:05.803 --> 29:07.554
Well?

29:07.605 --> 29:10.440
The whole family's here.

29:10.475 --> 29:11.858
Even Susan.

29:15.196 --> 29:17.230
Show 'em who you are.

29:20.151 --> 29:22.319
You weren't gonna tell me?

29:23.655 --> 29:24.655
What?

29:24.706 --> 29:26.490
I'm gonna be a grandfather

29:26.492 --> 29:28.875
and you don't want me to know?

29:30.628 --> 29:33.213
Is that what you think of me?

29:35.883 --> 29:37.751
Give me the gun.

29:39.170 --> 29:41.838
<i>Give me the gun.</i>

29:50.264 --> 29:51.848
Let's just leave it be.

29:51.899 --> 29:54.484
- You and I aren't...
- No!

29:54.519 --> 29:56.403
Like I was never even here!

29:59.023 --> 30:00.857
Don't!

30:06.698 --> 30:10.083
Stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!

30:10.118 --> 30:11.918
Stop.

30:12.787 --> 30:15.622
- No!
- Let go!

30:15.673 --> 30:18.341
- Let go!
- No, you won't now.

30:18.376 --> 30:20.994
<i>- For me.
- It's okay, isn't it?</i>

30:21.028 --> 30:22.546
Isn't it all okay?

30:22.548 --> 30:25.248
Touch our mother again, I'll
give you what you deserve.

30:25.316 --> 30:26.883
Law or no.

30:26.885 --> 30:28.969
Count on it.

30:29.053 --> 30:30.854
We're here.

30:30.888 --> 30:32.689
We're here!

30:32.724 --> 30:34.891
Wherever you think
you're runnin',

30:34.893 --> 30:37.110
we're always gonna
be right here!

30:56.464 --> 30:58.248
Are you there?

31:01.669 --> 31:03.386
You called me.

31:24.275 --> 31:28.612
Yesterday, I went for a swim.

31:29.781 --> 31:32.499
First light.
Haven't done that in...

31:32.533 --> 31:34.918
45 years.

31:34.952 --> 31:36.620
It's too cold out there.

31:36.622 --> 31:37.871
I didn't mind.

31:37.922 --> 31:40.540
Went out past the surf line.

31:40.591 --> 31:43.176
Further than I ever
dared as a kid.

31:43.211 --> 31:46.046
"Keep going," I thought.

31:46.097 --> 31:49.549
"Keep going until
you can't turn back."

31:49.600 --> 31:54.221
That's where
there isn't any choice.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.190
And?

31:57.225 --> 31:58.892
You don't know where that is.

31:58.943 --> 32:01.645
You can't know
until you pass it.

32:03.147 --> 32:05.282
And then it's too late.

32:07.869 --> 32:10.654
You never wanted to be here.

32:10.656 --> 32:13.073
Not from the start.

32:14.709 --> 32:17.928
Look, the deal is settled.

32:17.962 --> 32:21.798
However I handled it,
what does it matter?

32:21.833 --> 32:23.333
It's done.

32:27.004 --> 32:29.005
But you and I...

32:30.758 --> 32:33.143
We won't see each other again.

32:34.679 --> 32:36.730
<i>I think that's best.</i>

32:38.683 --> 32:40.684
Don't you?

32:43.187 --> 32:45.322
<i>Eli?</i>

32:48.526 --> 32:51.244
At least look at me.

32:53.781 --> 32:56.249
What am I supposed
to do with myself?

32:56.284 --> 32:59.169
Aren't you done
with me telling you?

33:02.173 --> 33:03.707
What are you
waiting for anyway?

33:03.758 --> 33:05.208
She won't even open the door.

33:05.259 --> 33:07.594
- You don't know that.
- She won't.

33:09.547 --> 33:13.049
Maybe you're right, but if you don't
try, you'll always regret it.

33:15.853 --> 33:17.971
That's what I think.

33:21.525 --> 33:23.944
How come you got
to be the wise one?

33:26.364 --> 33:28.565
Because you needed me to be.

33:50.254 --> 33:52.839
There's a few things in there.

33:52.890 --> 33:54.674
Maybe you can use them.

34:26.257 --> 34:28.174
Little brother.

35:45.953 --> 35:47.704
Okay, let's go.

35:48.556 --> 35:50.206
There he is!

35:50.257 --> 35:52.258
Mr. Capone, you're my hero.

35:52.293 --> 35:54.377
What, is there
a ball game here today?

35:54.379 --> 35:57.547
Mr. Capone, think
you'll beat the charges?

35:57.549 --> 35:59.599
No can holds this sardine.

35:59.633 --> 36:01.801
Say, you hear they're making
a movie about me?

36:01.852 --> 36:03.303
Does someone take over
the outfit in your place?

36:03.354 --> 36:05.271
What outfit?
I'm a businessman.

36:05.306 --> 36:07.957
I got 500 men working
for me out there.

36:07.992 --> 36:10.643
And this country ain't gonna take
care of them if this ship goes down.

36:10.694 --> 36:14.948
Hey, Al, give us that
smile, the old chin out.

36:14.982 --> 36:17.067
<i>- John Barrymore.
- Attaboy!</i>

36:17.118 --> 36:20.537
Hold it! Just a couple
more, Mr. Capone.

36:20.571 --> 36:22.122
How about a picture
for the final?

36:22.156 --> 36:23.873
Get enough to last, boys.

36:26.627 --> 36:29.162
<i>Right here. Just look
right here one second.</i>

36:29.213 --> 36:32.749
<i>Al, Al, you think you're
gonna beat the rap, huh?</i>

36:39.173 --> 36:40.840
<i>It's all lies!</i>

36:47.681 --> 36:49.933
Thank you all for being here.

36:49.984 --> 36:51.601
Mr. Magaddino especially.

36:51.603 --> 36:54.187
Come all the way down
from upstate.

36:54.238 --> 36:57.157
Obviously our friend from
Chicago couldn't make it.

36:57.191 --> 36:58.942
We wish him well.

36:58.944 --> 37:01.611
Pay your taxes, fellas.

37:05.032 --> 37:07.700
This table,
it's round for a reason.

37:07.751 --> 37:10.019
'Cause nobody sits at the head.

37:11.288 --> 37:13.006
There's no boss.

37:13.040 --> 37:16.593
There's seven bosses.
A commission.

37:16.627 --> 37:20.463
<i>The five families in New York
plus buffalo and Chicago.</i>

37:20.514 --> 37:24.968
Nobody gets made
unless we all approve.

37:24.970 --> 37:26.970
Put it to a vote.

37:27.021 --> 37:29.539
Any beefs, wherever you go,

37:29.573 --> 37:32.692
new Orleans, Kansas City, St.
Louis,

37:32.726 --> 37:35.812
they get settled here by us

37:35.814 --> 37:38.448
before things get out of hand.

37:39.483 --> 37:42.485
The old way of doing things,

37:42.536 --> 37:44.571
it's over.

37:44.655 --> 37:47.207
The mustache petes
are in the ground.

37:47.241 --> 37:49.409
Our friends, our partners,

37:49.460 --> 37:52.328
<i>the Jews, the Irish,</i>

37:52.379 --> 37:53.997
what have you.

37:53.999 --> 37:57.050
If it's good for business,
it's good for us.

37:57.084 --> 38:00.136
There's no point in limiting
our opportunities.

38:06.177 --> 38:08.011
The future is ours, boys.

38:08.062 --> 38:09.812
- Hear, hear.
- Salut.

38:09.847 --> 38:11.731
- L'Chaim.
- Salut.

38:15.486 --> 38:17.187
Thank you.
Thank you.

38:17.189 --> 38:19.589
Thank you, doctor. What a
thought-provoking lecture.

38:19.623 --> 38:21.541
Thank you, my dear.
Darling.

38:21.592 --> 38:24.010
<i>- Thank you.
- Woman: Wonderful words.</i>

38:24.044 --> 38:26.880
Thank you. Yes, I was
feeling it today.

38:26.931 --> 38:28.598
Thank you.

38:28.632 --> 38:30.466
<i>You're truly blessed.</i>

38:30.517 --> 38:32.468
At times such as these,

38:32.519 --> 38:34.554
the words of ecclesiastes
are ever on my mind.

38:34.605 --> 38:36.172
- Man: Yes!
- Woman: Yes!

38:36.207 --> 38:38.791
"One generation passeth away,"

38:38.842 --> 38:41.044
another generation cometh.

38:41.095 --> 38:43.713
"But the earth
abideth forever."

38:43.764 --> 38:44.659
<i>Amen.</i>

38:44.660 --> 38:47.050
"The sun rises and
the sun goes down."

38:47.052 --> 38:49.052
- Oh!
- "It hastens to the place"...

38:51.556 --> 38:53.523
Oh! Doctor!

38:53.557 --> 38:55.441
<i>Man:
Doctor!</i>

38:55.476 --> 38:57.777
Oh, somebody help!

38:59.580 --> 39:01.297
<i>Woman:
No! No! No!</i>

39:01.332 --> 39:04.133
<i>Oh, no, dear lord!</i>

39:04.168 --> 39:07.253
<i>- Come on.
- Oh, doctor!</i>

39:08.472 --> 39:10.840
<i>Doctor!</i>

39:12.493 --> 39:14.577
We generally don't
tell the patients

39:14.579 --> 39:17.163
that someone's
coming to see them.

39:17.214 --> 39:21.134
It creates an expectation
that can cause difficulties.

39:22.419 --> 39:24.254
But she's a model girl,

39:24.305 --> 39:27.590
so we let her know she
would be having a visitor.

39:27.592 --> 39:29.842
She's been preparing all day.

39:33.731 --> 39:35.598
There she is.

39:48.946 --> 39:51.781
Let's just get
something straight.

39:53.250 --> 39:56.002
Whatever you want,

39:56.036 --> 39:58.288
whatever you think I will do,

39:58.372 --> 40:00.757
that won't be possible.

40:00.791 --> 40:02.959
All right?

40:08.265 --> 40:10.383
You were very clever.

40:10.434 --> 40:13.469
<i>You made a bargain.</i>

40:13.520 --> 40:16.606
<i>You saved your own neck.</i>

40:17.808 --> 40:20.143
And that's more than
other people can say.

40:23.397 --> 40:26.532
I'm not someone you
should look to for help.

40:29.820 --> 40:32.038
I'm leaving here.

40:32.072 --> 40:34.374
Starting something new.

40:34.408 --> 40:36.626
I won't be back.

40:38.245 --> 40:40.163
You'll have
your own room inside.

40:40.165 --> 40:42.215
That's been arranged.

40:43.334 --> 40:45.335
And if you get yourself out,

40:45.337 --> 40:48.004
there'll be money
in a trust account.

40:49.139 --> 40:51.424
But that's all.

40:52.843 --> 40:55.311
Don't write me.

40:55.346 --> 40:57.513
Don't try to find me.

40:58.849 --> 41:01.150
Don't look for anything else.

41:06.440 --> 41:08.858
Do we understand each other?

41:14.531 --> 41:18.368
You want me on my knees?
I won't do that.

41:20.454 --> 41:22.705
The past is past.

41:24.508 --> 41:26.275
Nothing can change it.

41:32.549 --> 41:35.101
What do you expect of me?

41:39.690 --> 41:41.941
They're called ladybugs.

41:44.445 --> 41:47.864
But how can you tell
which one's a lady?

41:55.789 --> 41:57.490
Did you enjoy your visit?

41:57.541 --> 41:59.158
Oh, yes.

41:59.243 --> 42:01.327
Nice to see old friends?

42:18.930 --> 42:21.264
I'm sorry.
It's a bit tender.

42:21.266 --> 42:23.649
Dr. Cotton will
give you something.

42:28.772 --> 42:30.907
Would you be so kind?

42:43.787 --> 42:46.706
There's still graciousness
in the world.

43:07.978 --> 43:10.196
Come clean me right here!

43:13.116 --> 43:15.284
Marry me, baby!

43:16.954 --> 43:19.489
<i>That's it. Shake 'em up!
Shake 'em up!</i>

43:21.492 --> 43:23.326
Help you?

43:23.410 --> 43:25.044
I'm here for my things.

43:25.078 --> 43:26.629
He's okay.

43:26.663 --> 43:28.581
Need to pat you down, though.

43:30.300 --> 43:32.802
Can't be too careful.

43:32.836 --> 43:36.339
These dancers, huh?
Look hot to trot.

43:36.390 --> 43:39.509
Start talking to them, you
realize they're all fucked up.

43:41.845 --> 43:43.513
Don't overstay your welcome.

43:43.515 --> 43:46.315
Mr. Luciano
wouldn't like it.

44:47.210 --> 44:49.495
Am I allowed to answer?

44:49.546 --> 44:51.581
It's a private line.

44:54.251 --> 44:55.885
Make it quick.

45:00.507 --> 45:01.974
Hello?

45:02.009 --> 45:04.760
<i>- Hello, Mr. Thompson?
- Who's this?</i>

45:04.811 --> 45:06.929
<i>Vic Borden,
manager at the ritz.</i>

45:06.980 --> 45:09.098
<i>Sorry to bother you,
but I have a situation</i>

45:09.149 --> 45:10.533
<i>that needs your attention.</i>

45:10.567 --> 45:12.602
<i>Neary:
Aren't we truly blessed</i>

45:12.653 --> 45:15.354
<i>to have both
the splendors of nature</i>

45:15.405 --> 45:17.857
<i>and the delights
of civilization</i>

45:17.908 --> 45:20.276
<i>- right on our doorstep?
- Hear, hear!</i>

45:20.278 --> 45:22.945
<i>I'd like to take a moment
to express my gratitude</i>

45:22.996 --> 45:25.114
<i>to mayor Stoy, judge Lewellen,</i>

45:25.116 --> 45:27.416
and, of course,
Commodore Kaestner,

45:27.451 --> 45:29.619
to whose vision
and public spirit

45:29.621 --> 45:32.455
<i>this city owes so very much.</i>

45:32.457 --> 45:34.423
<i>Jim Neary for alderman!</i>

45:38.345 --> 45:41.297
What's that?
What's that I hear?

45:41.348 --> 45:45.134
<i>Could it be? I believe it is.</i>

45:45.185 --> 45:48.187
Ladies and gentlemen,
the lord of the deep himself.

46:20.220 --> 46:23.422
Greetings, mortals of the land.

46:23.473 --> 46:26.308
King Neptune welcomes you.

46:42.192 --> 46:44.527
Whoa, whoa, I got her.
I got her.

46:44.529 --> 46:47.029
Stop squirming.
Stop squirming.

46:47.080 --> 46:48.748
What did she do?

46:48.782 --> 46:50.783
I just want to talk to her.

46:50.834 --> 46:52.418
Is that all right?

46:58.341 --> 47:00.042
Didn't you think I'd spot you?

47:02.379 --> 47:04.130
What were you thinking?

47:04.181 --> 47:06.465
That it'd be fun

47:06.516 --> 47:08.517
to be in a parade.

47:09.886 --> 47:11.637
What happened to your face?

47:11.688 --> 47:14.890
You're not the only one who doesn't
like where she's come from.

47:14.892 --> 47:17.226
You said you belong here.

47:17.277 --> 47:19.361
People say lots of things.

47:19.396 --> 47:23.449
You have a home.
You have Mrs. Thompson.

47:23.483 --> 47:25.067
You're going to have a family.

47:25.069 --> 47:27.203
<i>Let this
happy season begin!</i>

47:38.082 --> 47:40.583
What am I supposed
to do with you?

47:40.634 --> 47:43.385
Just let me be.

47:43.420 --> 47:45.554
I can't do that.

47:45.589 --> 47:47.556
Then put me in jail.

47:47.591 --> 47:49.809
You mean to anyway.

47:53.313 --> 47:55.931
Mrs. Thompson said
you want to be good.

47:58.318 --> 48:00.686
But you don't know how.

48:01.905 --> 48:04.490
- Do you?
- I try.

48:09.446 --> 48:12.114
He wants you up on the porch.

48:16.703 --> 48:18.788
Would you stay here?

48:18.790 --> 48:20.289
Just for a moment?

48:20.340 --> 48:21.507
What if I didn't?

48:21.541 --> 48:24.043
I don't see how I'd stop you.

48:25.295 --> 48:27.346
Please?

48:34.137 --> 48:36.522
Polite kid, I'll give him that.

48:36.556 --> 48:38.474
Pretty lousy thief.

48:38.476 --> 48:41.310
Hanging around the lobby. Said
he was waiting for someone.

48:41.312 --> 48:43.729
The woman he robbed,
is she okay?

48:43.780 --> 48:45.314
Down here from Hartford.

48:45.365 --> 48:48.567
Doesn't want to get
involved in pressing charges.

48:48.618 --> 48:49.819
<i>I would have
called the sheriff,</i>

48:49.870 --> 48:52.988
<i>but I don't want any trouble.</i>

48:52.990 --> 48:55.925
Howdy, Mr. Thompson.

48:55.959 --> 48:58.410
Yeah, howdy.

48:59.496 --> 49:02.581
Thank the nice man
and let's go.

49:16.596 --> 49:20.149
The peasant stands up from the
bushes, shouts, "don't shoot."

49:20.183 --> 49:22.484
I'm not an elk.
I'm not an elk."

49:22.519 --> 49:24.854
Oh, I thought he said
he was an elk.

49:27.274 --> 49:30.442
You boys enjoy yourselves now.

49:30.493 --> 49:32.995
I'll see you inside
later for supper.

49:33.029 --> 49:35.614
Give me the badge.

49:35.665 --> 49:37.166
What?

49:37.200 --> 49:39.034
Give me the badge.

49:46.710 --> 49:48.210
Now go.

49:48.212 --> 49:50.212
I don't understand.

49:50.263 --> 49:52.464
Nothing to understand.
We're done.

49:54.885 --> 49:56.886
Why?

49:56.937 --> 49:59.889
I don't have faith in you.

49:59.940 --> 50:02.391
But you have faith
in Jim Neary?

50:02.393 --> 50:05.311
You have faith in
a backslapping bootlicker?

50:05.362 --> 50:08.447
I looked up to you.

50:08.481 --> 50:11.317
I served you.
I've waited.

50:11.368 --> 50:13.319
I've kept my mouth shut.

50:13.370 --> 50:14.259
You can't just...

50:14.260 --> 50:16.038
You press yourself
and I don't like it.

50:16.072 --> 50:20.075
You think you deserve
something for trying hard.

50:20.126 --> 50:23.295
I've never liked that
one little bit.

50:23.330 --> 50:27.466
Through me and from me,
that's all there is.

50:31.671 --> 50:33.923
What are you in the end anyway?

50:34.841 --> 50:37.092
I'm what I need to be.

50:37.094 --> 50:40.095
How's that make you
anything at all?

50:40.097 --> 50:42.264
The nerve.

50:42.315 --> 50:43.849
Or you disappear.

50:43.900 --> 50:46.602
<i>- Hello, Louis.
- Nicholas.</i>

50:46.604 --> 50:48.437
How can I oblige you
this fine day?

50:48.488 --> 50:49.772
You know my friend Phillip.

50:49.774 --> 50:51.440
<i>You wanted to get ahead.</i>

50:51.442 --> 50:53.492
Stealing purses in lobbies,

50:53.526 --> 50:55.778
getting so boiled
you can't see straight,

50:55.780 --> 50:57.947
that's a smart way
to go about it?

50:57.949 --> 51:01.617
Well, you know, probably not.

51:01.619 --> 51:03.786
Where's the money I gave you?

51:06.923 --> 51:09.875
That was over $1,000.
People live on that.

51:09.926 --> 51:12.878
- You don't.
- I'm not talking about me.

51:12.929 --> 51:15.097
What the hell is in your head?

51:15.131 --> 51:17.967
- I'll earn it back.
- Doing what?

51:20.270 --> 51:22.137
Work at the club.

51:22.139 --> 51:23.722
Don't you know what's going on?

51:23.773 --> 51:27.192
The war is over.
The other side won.

51:27.227 --> 51:29.311
I can't help you.

51:31.648 --> 51:34.066
Go back home.

51:34.117 --> 51:36.452
I don't have one.

51:36.486 --> 51:38.070
Then go find one.

51:38.121 --> 51:41.457
Make one.
Or do without one.

51:41.491 --> 51:44.043
But don't take it out
on everyone else.

51:47.497 --> 51:49.381
Coffee's a nickel.

51:49.416 --> 51:51.383
The rest I don't care about.

51:55.638 --> 51:57.172
The answer to everything.

51:57.223 --> 52:00.926
No, just the best one I've got.

52:15.025 --> 52:18.410
Okay, kid.
You showed me.

52:22.265 --> 52:25.167
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

52:44.270 --> 52:46.221
Nucky.

52:46.223 --> 52:48.273
<i>Thompson.</i>

52:51.561 --> 52:54.813
There is a youth the Commodore
wishes to place in service.

52:54.864 --> 52:57.399
What's that got to do with me?

52:57.401 --> 53:00.652
The task is entrusted
to the sheriff.

53:33.269 --> 53:35.938
<i>Whitlock: You understand
this is an act of charity?</i>

53:57.677 --> 54:00.262
<i>You tell Jared Dano he's a...</i>

54:00.296 --> 54:03.265
<i>"I wanted the gold,
and I sought it;</i>

54:03.299 --> 54:04.933
I scrabbled and mucked
like a slave.

54:04.968 --> 54:07.853
Was it famine or scurvy...
I fought it;

54:07.937 --> 54:10.472
"I hurled my youth
into a grave."

54:10.474 --> 54:13.058
"I wanted the gold
and I got it..."

54:13.109 --> 54:14.893
Came out with
a fortune last fall...

54:14.944 --> 54:16.979
Yet somehow life's not
what I thought it,

54:16.981 --> 54:19.114
"and somehow
the gold isn't all."

54:28.324 --> 54:30.826
Is something wrong?

54:32.962 --> 54:34.213
What?

54:34.247 --> 54:36.715
Is something wrong?

54:36.749 --> 54:39.668
No. No.

54:39.719 --> 54:42.004
Do we have to leave?

54:42.972 --> 54:45.841
Can I go down to the beach?

54:45.843 --> 54:49.344
You want to sail
around the world.

54:52.649 --> 54:54.766
Don't you?

55:01.024 --> 55:02.774
When mima talked about you...

55:02.825 --> 55:04.409
Out of my way.

55:04.444 --> 55:06.278
I couldn't tell
if it was love or hate.

55:06.329 --> 55:07.996
Don't know anyone named mima.

55:08.031 --> 55:10.282
Grandma.

55:10.333 --> 55:12.367
She'd go on and on.

55:12.418 --> 55:16.088
There is a man here,
he's very rich.

55:16.122 --> 55:20.592
<i>And he's been good...
To me.</i>

55:21.794 --> 55:24.263
He's...

55:24.297 --> 55:26.715
Offered to help us.

55:26.766 --> 55:28.800
Both.

55:30.303 --> 55:32.487
Would you like to meet him?

55:38.361 --> 55:41.813
I promise I'll always
look after you.

55:56.129 --> 55:58.830
Who are you?

56:01.050 --> 56:03.969
Tommy Darmody.

56:08.391 --> 56:11.009
Tommy...
You don't...

56:12.979 --> 56:15.931
<i>A gun!</i>

56:40.039 --> 56:41.857
<i>Mr. Thompson,
can you hear me?</i>

56:41.891 --> 56:43.008
Can you hear me?

56:43.042 --> 56:44.993
We're agents of the
internal revenue service.

56:45.028 --> 56:47.296
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

56:47.298 --> 56:50.098
We're agents.
Do you understand?
