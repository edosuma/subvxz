00:24.324 --> 00:25.916
Commander Chakotay.

00:25.992 --> 00:27.653
l understand
you wanted to see me.

00:27.727 --> 00:30.423
l'm told you are the officer
in charge of personnel,

00:30.497 --> 00:32.988
that you prepare
the...duty assignments.

00:33.066 --> 00:34.624
ls that the correct phrase?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.532
That's right.

00:36.603 --> 00:40.937
l'm finding it...difficult
to spend so much time alone.

00:41.007 --> 00:43.271
l am unaccustomed to it.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.641
The hours do not pass quickly.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.270
l can understand that.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.336
How can we help?

00:48.415 --> 00:51.145
l've been considering
the matter carefully.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.481
l would like to request
a duty assignment.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.386
Did you have something
specific in mind?

00:56.456 --> 00:58.515
Yes.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.592
Now what?

01:03.296 --> 01:05.355
There's been a rupture
in the coolant injector.

01:05.432 --> 01:06.364
l can see that!

01:06.433 --> 01:07.457
Why haven't you sealed it off?

01:07.534 --> 01:08.796
l'm attempting to do so.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.468
That's better.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.203
Lieutenant, l have an idea.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.209
Perhaps it would be advisable

01:18.278 --> 01:19.575
to reconfigure
the coolant assembly.

01:19.646 --> 01:20.772
That would give us
greater control

01:20.847 --> 01:22.075
over the pressure valve
emissions.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.240
You're probably right.

01:23.316 --> 01:25.716
And tomorrow, we can do it
first thing, but not today.

01:25.785 --> 01:26.911
l don't understand.

01:26.986 --> 01:28.317
Why wait till tomorrow
when today...?

01:28.388 --> 01:30.413
Not today, Vorik.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.184
Good morning.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.126
Here's the helm control
evaluation you wanted.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.323
Thank you.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.600
We still on for dinner tonight?

01:41.668 --> 01:43.397
l may have to work.
l'll let you know.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.997
Uh- huh. Okay.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.904
Have you decided if you're...

01:49.976 --> 01:51.603
if you're going through with it?

01:51.678 --> 01:52.872
l have

01:52.946 --> 01:55.312
and l'm not.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.372
Today hasn't started out
very well

01:57.450 --> 01:58.576
and the last thing l need

01:58.651 --> 02:00.983
is to get involved with
some obscure Klingon ritual.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.919
You were the one
who suggested it.

02:03.022 --> 02:03.920
l know.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.320
And for one sentimental minute,

02:05.391 --> 02:07.484
l thought that l might
actually go through with it,

02:07.560 --> 02:08.686
but not anymore.

02:08.761 --> 02:09.853
Of course not.

02:09.929 --> 02:11.829
Wouldn't want to get
too sentimental.

02:14.434 --> 02:15.924
l overslept this morning

02:16.035 --> 02:19.095
because l forgot to tell
the computer to wake me

02:19.172 --> 02:22.164
and then the acoustic inverter
in my sonic shower blew out.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.210
That'll make your hair
stand on end.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.471
So l didn't have time
for breakfast

02:25.545 --> 02:26.978
and when l got here,
two people were out sick

02:27.080 --> 02:29.139
so l had to cancel
the fuel cell overhaul.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.547
And then an injector burst
for no apparent reason

02:31.618 --> 02:33.142
and started spewing
plasma coolant...

02:33.219 --> 02:34.743
Well, that's a run of bad luck
all right.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.982
So, l am in a bad mood,
and l know

02:37.056 --> 02:38.887
that l am being
a little bit testy.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.358
No. That's okay.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.622
Think about that dinner.

02:46.399 --> 02:47.889
Be careful.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.037
Something interesting
just happened.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.232
What's that?

02:54.307 --> 02:56.502
Seven of Nine requested
a duty assignment.

02:56.576 --> 02:57.565
Fascinating.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.544
She wants to work
in Engineering.

02:59.612 --> 03:00.476
What?

03:00.547 --> 03:02.242
The Borg use transwarp conduits

03:02.315 --> 03:04.510
to travel through space
faster than warp speed.

03:04.584 --> 03:05.915
lf we could create
one of them...

03:05.985 --> 03:08.453
We don't know anything
about transwarp technology.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.421
Playing around with it
could be dangerous.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.752
That's where Seven of Nine
comes in.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.416
She's offered to work with you.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.427
What do you think
her real motives are?

03:16.496 --> 03:17.622
She's having a tough time

03:17.697 --> 03:19.597
making the transition
from the collective.

03:19.666 --> 03:20.655
She wants something to do.

03:20.733 --> 03:24.134
l never thought of you
as naive, Chakotay.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.695
Bottom line is,

03:26.773 --> 03:29.435
l don't want her working
in Engineering.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.704
The bottom line is,
l'm giving you an order

03:31.778 --> 03:34.008
and you're going
to follow it, Lieutenant.

03:36.649 --> 03:37.707
Whatever you say, sir.

05:31.864 --> 05:34.332
Seven of Nine,
you told me you wouldn't

05:34.400 --> 05:36.459
make any more attempts
to contact the Borg.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.663
And l want to believe
that's true.

05:38.738 --> 05:39.932
l assure you it is.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.268
l've decided not to post

05:41.341 --> 05:43.809
a security detail while
you're in Engineering,

05:43.876 --> 05:45.867
but you have to realize
there are rules.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.140
You'll be expected
to follow our protocols.

05:48.214 --> 05:50.114
You'll report directly
to Lieutenant Torres

05:50.183 --> 05:52.117
and obey any order
she gives you.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.152
l understand.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.550
One more thing--

05:54.620 --> 05:58.215
your designation,
"Seven of Nine"

05:58.291 --> 06:00.418
is a little cumbersome.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.687
Wouldn't you prefer

06:01.761 --> 06:04.321
to be called
by your given name, Annika?

06:04.397 --> 06:08.197
l have been Seven of Nine
for as long as l can remember.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.862
All right.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.495
But maybe we could
streamline it a little.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.871
How would you feel about...

06:15.942 --> 06:16.874
"Seven"?

06:18.778 --> 06:21.178
lmprecise...

06:21.247 --> 06:22.771
but acceptable.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.714
Tuvok to Captain Janeway.

06:24.784 --> 06:25.716
Yes, Tuvok?

06:25.785 --> 06:27.218
Please come to the Bridge.

06:27.286 --> 06:28.776
A ship is approaching.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.063
lt's damaged, but functional.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.793
Energy emissions are so low

06:40.867 --> 06:43.529
it's probably not capable
of warp speed.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.935
Several dozen life signs aboard.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.801
We are being hailed, Captain.

06:47.874 --> 06:48.966
Open a channel.

06:50.009 --> 06:51.670
l'm Captain Kathryn Janeway

06:51.744 --> 06:53.871
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.176
l am Rahmin.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.649
My people are the Caatati.

06:58.718 --> 07:00.447
l apologize

07:00.520 --> 07:06.322
for our appearance
and the condition of our ship.

07:06.392 --> 07:09.828
Most of our people
were assimilated by the Borg

07:09.896 --> 07:12.262
over a year ago.

07:12.331 --> 07:15.129
We lost everything.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.401
How many of you escaped?

07:20.473 --> 07:24.239
A few thousand, on 30 ships--

07:24.310 --> 07:28.371
all that's left
from a planet of millions.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.710
l'm sorry.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.874
Captain...

07:30.950 --> 07:33.009
l want to assure you

07:33.085 --> 07:36.782
my people were once
proud and accomplished.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.756
l understand.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.623
lt pains me to have to ask this,

07:41.694 --> 07:46.757
but l have 88 people
to care for on this vessel.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.859
We need food, medicines.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.996
ls there any way
you could help us?

07:54.240 --> 07:55.537
Of course.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.974
Send us a list of your needs
and we'll see what we can do.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.739
l'm deeply grateful.

08:00.813 --> 08:04.340
lf it's not too much to ask,

08:04.417 --> 08:07.250
is there any way
you might also spare

08:07.320 --> 08:10.221
a small quantity
of thorium isotopes?

08:10.289 --> 08:14.487
Without them,
our systems can't function.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.050
l think we can arrange that.

08:16.128 --> 08:17.857
l'll speak to my engineer.

08:17.930 --> 08:24.631
You...can't imagine
what this means to us, Captain.

08:24.704 --> 08:27.070
Thank you.

08:40.119 --> 08:42.485
How are those thorium isotopes
coming, Vorik?

08:42.554 --> 08:43.885
l'll admit l'm having trouble

08:43.956 --> 08:45.583
controlling
the neutron absorption.

08:45.658 --> 08:48.525
Try increasing
the temperature of the plasma.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.926
Get the thorium to the Captain
as soon as it's ready.

08:50.997 --> 08:52.123
Of course.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.497
Tell me something...

08:54.567 --> 08:58.731
when you hear
about people like the Caatati,

08:58.804 --> 09:01.204
do you have
any feelings of remorse?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.743
No.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.042
That's it?

09:09.115 --> 09:10.207
Just"no"?

09:10.283 --> 09:13.184
What further answer
do you require?

09:13.252 --> 09:15.220
Oh, maybe some kind
of acknowledgment

09:15.288 --> 09:18.155
of the billions of lives
you helped destroy...

09:18.224 --> 09:20.419
a justification
for what you did...

09:20.493 --> 09:22.620
maybe...
a little sense of guilt.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.287
Guilt is irrelevant.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.593
Heartwarming.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.226
l've set the parameters
for the tachyon burst

09:29.302 --> 09:31.600
we'll need to create
a transwarp conduit.

09:33.539 --> 09:35.837
lt will be several hours
before the main deflector

09:35.908 --> 09:37.375
can be modified.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.843
l think it would be best
if l waited in my alcove.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.244
l think you're right.

10:08.507 --> 10:09.940
lf l ever saw

10:10.009 --> 10:12.705
a job for the morale officer,
it's sitting right here.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.507
l'll bet l can help.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.707
You're facing
a big challenge, Neelix.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.807
l enjoy a challenge.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.849
ls that supposed
to make me feel better?

10:23.923 --> 10:25.515
Blood pie, for the Day of Honor.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.491
How did you know about that?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.494
Has Tom been talking to you?

10:29.562 --> 10:31.223
Not at all.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.765
No, l- l make it a point
to know these things.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.824
And if l'm correct,

10:35.901 --> 10:37.732
many Klingon families
traditionally serve

10:37.803 --> 10:40.397
blood pie on the Day of Honor.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.465
l appreciate the gesture,
Neelix,

10:43.542 --> 10:47.273
but, um, l've decided to ignore
this particular tradition.

10:47.346 --> 10:50.611
No blood pie, no examining
my behavior over the last year

10:50.683 --> 10:52.947
to see if l measure up
to Klingon standards.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.680
Understood.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.181
Lieutenant...

11:03.496 --> 11:04.724
without knowing why

11:04.797 --> 11:07.732
there's a black cloud
hanging over your head,

11:07.800 --> 11:09.859
may l suggest something?

11:09.935 --> 11:11.493
Go right ahead.

11:11.570 --> 11:16.303
You have a...bit of a temper...

11:16.375 --> 11:18.434
that you keep reined in

11:18.511 --> 11:21.344
and sometimes,
it builds up inside you

11:21.414 --> 11:23.143
until you explode at someone.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.241
l'd say that about sums it up.

11:26.318 --> 11:29.082
l'm offering to be
a pressure valve.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.156
A what?

11:31.223 --> 11:35.353
You may use me
to blow off steam.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.918
When you're angry, come see me,

11:36.996 --> 11:37.928
call me names

11:37.997 --> 11:40.261
insult me,
question my parentage.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.799
l won't take it personally,

11:41.867 --> 11:43.858
and you won't need
to keep things

11:43.936 --> 11:44.903
bottled up inside anymore.

11:47.073 --> 11:50.941
That may be the nicest offer
l've had in a long time.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.638
Thank you, Neelix.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.513
You're sweet, but l'm not sure
l could do that to you.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.609
l'm here if you need me.

12:03.923 --> 12:04.912
Neelix...

12:07.159 --> 12:09.627
about this, um, Day of Honor.

12:10.696 --> 12:13.130
Do you think
l should go through with it?

12:14.800 --> 12:15.926
l've always thought

12:16.001 --> 12:17.866
traditions were good things...

12:17.937 --> 12:19.234
worth preserving.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.770
l've been thinking a lot
about...

12:22.842 --> 12:25.834
the rituals that my mother
taught me, and...

12:25.911 --> 12:30.439
they don't seem quite so hateful
as they did when l was a child.

12:30.516 --> 12:35.647
Maybe being so far away from
anything Klingon has changed me.

12:35.721 --> 12:38.656
lt certainly can't hurt
to go through with the ceremony.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.222
l don't know
what effect it'll have on me.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.861
That's what's frightening.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.031
All right.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.840
Bring on the blood pie.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.420
l can do this.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.901
Qapla'!

13:30.976 --> 13:33.536
What warrior goes there?

13:33.612 --> 13:36.342
My name is B'Elanna.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.713
Have you come
to have your honor challenged?

13:38.784 --> 13:41.947
l guess so. Yes.

13:42.021 --> 13:45.422
Are you willing to see
the ceremony through to the end?

13:45.491 --> 13:47.721
That's the idea, isn't it?

13:47.793 --> 13:50.227
What do l do?

13:50.296 --> 13:52.730
lt will be a lengthy ordeal.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.767
First, you must eat
from the heart

13:55.835 --> 13:57.735
of a sanctified targ.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.078
Pak lohr!

14:07.146 --> 14:11.378
Yes...the heart of a targ

14:11.450 --> 14:14.647
brings courage
to one who eats it.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.020
Next, you will drink mot'loch

14:19.091 --> 14:21.321
from the Grail of Kahless.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.529
Drink to the glory of Kahless,

14:27.600 --> 14:30.068
the greatest warrior
of all time.

14:35.808 --> 14:40.507
Kahless defeated his enemies
on the field of battle

14:40.579 --> 14:43.309
and built a mighty empire.

14:44.483 --> 14:47.111
How have you
proven yourself worthy?

14:47.186 --> 14:50.644
Um, l haven't built any empires,
and l can't say

14:50.723 --> 14:53.749
that l've personally defeated
any enemies in battle,

14:53.826 --> 14:56.090
but you have to realize,
l'm not living among warriors.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.652
Then how do you expect
to distinguish yourself?

14:58.731 --> 14:59.663
l don't know.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.098
l guess l'm doing
the best l can.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.068
Huh! A pitiful reply.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.368
Let us proceed.

15:07.439 --> 15:11.967
A warrior must endure
great hardship.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.512
To test your mettle,

15:14.580 --> 15:18.914
you will endure the Ritual
of Twenty Painstiks.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.851
After that,
you will engage in combat

15:21.921 --> 15:24.754
with a master of the bat'leth.

15:24.823 --> 15:29.851
Finally, you will traverse
the sulfur lagoons of Gorath.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.498
You know, l don't think so.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.261
l didn't want to do this
before you described it.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.802
Certainly not now.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.030
l'm leaving.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.870
Not until you have completed
the ceremony, pahtk.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.395
Thanks so much.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.934
lt's been lovely.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.503
Come in.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.481
l tried to find you before,
but you were on the holodeck.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.419
That's right.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.186
You know, you left it running.

16:34.259 --> 16:37.695
There was a Klingon in there
who didn't look too happy.

16:37.763 --> 16:39.321
Really.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.196
Yeah, and he was nursing
a whale of a black eye.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.632
Looks like he had a run- in

16:43.702 --> 16:45.670
with someone having
a really bad day.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.672
That's very funny.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.809
So, how'd it go?

16:54.179 --> 16:56.647
lt didn't.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.479
Do you mind if we talk
about something else?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.787
As a matter of fact, l do.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.723
You have been like
a spitting cobra all day

17:06.791 --> 17:08.419
and it's getting boring.

17:08.493 --> 17:10.962
You know, we designed that
holodeck program together,

17:11.030 --> 17:12.291
and l think you owe me
the courtesy

17:12.364 --> 17:13.387
of telling me what happened.

17:13.464 --> 17:17.299
lt was ridiculous,
meaningless posturing.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.337
Honor, dishonor--
what does it matter?

17:19.405 --> 17:22.067
lt matters because it's
part of who you are.

17:22.141 --> 17:25.133
You've been running away
from that your whole life.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.871
Who are you to tell me that?

17:28.513 --> 17:30.505
l care about you,

17:30.582 --> 17:32.607
but if you're going
to keep pushing me away,

17:32.684 --> 17:34.549
then there's no point
in my staying around, is there?

17:34.620 --> 17:36.645
Fine.
Just leave me alone.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.189
Oh, don't worry.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.815
lf this is the way
you treat people

17:39.892 --> 17:42.417
who try to be your friend,
you'll be alone, all right.

17:58.811 --> 18:02.212
There are over 200 people
on our three ships alone.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.478
Every one of them
suffers from malnourishment,

18:05.551 --> 18:08.782
but it's been hardest
on the children.

18:08.854 --> 18:12.153
Every parent sacrifices
for their child,

18:12.224 --> 18:15.250
but even so,
there's not enough food.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.761
lf you could hear
the crying of the babies,

18:17.830 --> 18:20.856
you would have as much trouble
sleeping at night as l do.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.265
Have you considered
relocation to a planet

18:23.335 --> 18:25.269
where you could
grow your own food?

18:25.337 --> 18:26.861
Of course...

18:26.939 --> 18:29.601
but we haven't
been welcomed anywhere.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.109
Because we have no resources,

18:32.177 --> 18:36.807
everyone treats us like
vagrants, even criminals.

18:36.882 --> 18:40.409
We're not unsympathetic,
but we have limited supplies.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.716
We can't possibly provide
enough for all your people.

18:42.788 --> 18:46.918
Forgive me, but, from my
perspective, you live in luxury.

18:46.992 --> 18:49.187
You don't suffer
from debilitating diseases.

18:49.261 --> 18:53.459
You have many sources
of energy-- replicators.

18:53.532 --> 18:56.592
Your crew is very well fed.

18:56.668 --> 19:01.230
Apparently,
keeping your bellies full

19:01.306 --> 19:04.571
is more important to you than
helping those less fortunate.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.838
That's unfair.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.278
These are the most generous
people you could hope to meet,

19:09.348 --> 19:11.646
but if we gave supplies
to everyone who asked,

19:11.717 --> 19:13.275
we wouldn't have anything left.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.343
Neelix, how much food
can we spare?

19:17.356 --> 19:20.792
We could provide each ship
with several hundred kilograms.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.224
Do it and check with the Doctor

19:22.294 --> 19:24.319
to see if he can spare
any medical supplies.

19:25.898 --> 19:26.865
Aye, Captain.

19:26.932 --> 19:27.899
Thank you.

19:29.134 --> 19:33.093
May the gods smile
on you and your crew.

19:33.172 --> 19:37.233
Tuvok, please escort our guest
to the transporter room.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.580
l've never navigated
a transwarp conduit.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.352
Any problems
l should be aware of?

19:53.425 --> 19:55.916
You have no idea
what you're doing.

19:55.994 --> 19:58.588
lf we attempt to enter one,
l'll have to take helm control.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.928
l am a quick study.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.694
What species is that?

20:02.768 --> 20:04.429
She is a human
who lived as a Borg.

20:04.503 --> 20:05.470
Borg!

20:05.537 --> 20:06.799
She is disconnected
from the collective.

20:06.872 --> 20:07.839
She won't harm you.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.498
Where's my wife?
Where are my children?

20:09.575 --> 20:11.372
What did you do with them
after you took them?

20:11.443 --> 20:12.876
What did you do
with my family?

20:12.945 --> 20:14.708
Mr. Paris, please proceed.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.682
l lost everything--
my family, my home...!

20:18.750 --> 20:20.843
Sorry about that.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.181
About what?

20:22.254 --> 20:24.415
Well, the way he reacted to you.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.751
He didn't injure me.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.223
Good.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.228
There are
many people on this ship

20:30.295 --> 20:32.263
who have similar feelings
toward me.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.323
l'm afraid you're right.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.662
Does that bother you?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.202
No.

20:39.605 --> 20:42.199
Well, l'm not
one of those people.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.708
We all have a past.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.038
What matters is now.

20:46.111 --> 20:49.342
l'm uncertain
what you're trying to say.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.211
That...

20:51.283 --> 20:53.843
if there's any way
that l can help you

20:53.919 --> 20:56.046
adjust to your life
here on Voyager,

20:56.121 --> 20:57.850
please ask me.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.756
l will remember your offer.

21:18.343 --> 21:19.367
All systems are ready.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.706
We're only going to take a peek.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.748
We open a conduit, get
as much sensor data as we can,

21:23.815 --> 21:25.146
and then close it up.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.447
l want to take this
one step at a time.

21:27.519 --> 21:28.986
l've set up
a temporary tachyon matrix

21:29.054 --> 21:30.419
within the main deflector.

21:30.489 --> 21:31.547
lt's on line.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.557
Engineering to the Bridge.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.956
We're ready to start, Captain.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.427
Go ahead. We'll monitor
your progress from here.

21:37.496 --> 21:38.986
We'll need to be at warp speed

21:39.064 --> 21:41.225
to create a large enough
subspace field.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.734
l'd like to reroute
helm control to Engineering.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.734
Agreed.
Janeway out.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.735
Take us past...

21:45.804 --> 21:47.362
Past warp 2. l know.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.825
We're at warp 2. 3.

22:08.894 --> 22:10.088
All right.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.357
Vorik, start emitting
the tachyons.

22:12.431 --> 22:13.955
Energizing the matrix.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.559
There's no indication
of a subspace field.

22:18.637 --> 22:21.105
l'd recommend switching
to a higher energy band.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.577
That did something.

22:27.646 --> 22:28.840
The subspace field is forming.

22:33.552 --> 22:36.419
Tachyon particles are leaking
into the propulsion system!

22:36.488 --> 22:37.648
Shut down the deflector.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.624
Done, but the leak
is continuing.

22:42.627 --> 22:44.458
Janeway to Engineering.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.157
Tachyons are flooding
the warp core, Captain!

22:47.232 --> 22:49.393
lf you can't stabilize
the core immediately,

22:49.468 --> 22:50.492
evacuate Engineering.

22:50.569 --> 22:53.129
Aye, Captain.
l'll get back to you.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.230
l've cut all power relays,
but the tachyon levels

22:55.307 --> 22:56.604
are still rising.

22:56.675 --> 22:58.768
All right. Everybody out!

22:58.844 --> 23:00.402
Now!

23:00.512 --> 23:01.444
That means you as well.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.538
l could be of help.

23:02.614 --> 23:03.876
That's an order!

23:06.918 --> 23:09.045
You can't order me.
l outrank you.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.316
We've got
to neutralize the core.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.655
l'll try decoupling
the dilithium matrix.

23:15.594 --> 23:16.822
No effect!

23:16.895 --> 23:18.226
Try it again.

23:19.998 --> 23:21.226
lt's not working!

23:21.299 --> 23:22.459
The core's about to breach!

23:22.534 --> 23:24.126
l've got to try one more thing.

23:24.202 --> 23:26.033
B'Elanna, there's no time!

23:26.104 --> 23:27.264
We've got to get out of here!

23:29.908 --> 23:31.535
Come on!

23:31.610 --> 23:34.272
Computer, prepare
to eject the warp core

23:34.346 --> 23:37.907
Authorization:
Torres- omega- five- nine- three.

23:40.452 --> 23:43.717
Computer, eject the warp core.

23:53.031 --> 23:53.998
Torres to Janeway.

23:54.099 --> 23:54.997
Go ahead.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.625
We've dumped the core.

24:03.408 --> 24:05.672
Welcome to the worst day
of my life.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.916
Vorik, we have to get

24:11.983 --> 24:14.417
those impulse engines
back on line.

24:14.486 --> 24:15.544
You and Nicoletti get started.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.552
Yes, Lieutenant.

24:16.621 --> 24:17.849
Report.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.015
We're stopped dead.

24:19.090 --> 24:21.650
The warp core is millions
of kilometers away by now

24:21.726 --> 24:23.887
and the impulse engines
are seriously damaged.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.793
l can give you a few thrusters,
but that's about it.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.661
How long before l can
have impulse power?

24:27.732 --> 24:29.097
l can't give you
an estimate on that.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.395
We're still assessing
the damage.

24:31.903 --> 24:35.100
So much for opening
a transwarp conduit.

24:35.173 --> 24:38.574
l sent the Borg
back to her alcove.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.203
We won't be needing her
in here anymore.

24:41.279 --> 24:43.873
At least
the core's still intact.

24:43.949 --> 24:44.973
Tom.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.711
Take a shuttle and find it.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.548
See if you can tractor
it back to Voyager.

24:48.620 --> 24:49.587
Yes, ma'am.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.586
lt'll be unstable.

24:50.655 --> 24:51.644
lt should be repaired

24:51.723 --> 24:53.156
before he tries to put
a tractor beam on it.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.214
Well, then, you go with him.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.691
Do whatever you have to.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.125
Just get it back
here in one piece.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.815
We're getting near
some random ion turbulence.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.612
l'll change course to avoid it.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.915
l wonder what else
can go wrong today?

25:25.991 --> 25:29.358
lf we get this core back,
l'm going right to bed

25:29.427 --> 25:30.917
and sleeping straight through
till tomorrow.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.758
Get this day over with.

25:32.831 --> 25:33.798
Well, look at it this way--

25:33.865 --> 25:34.923
how much worse could it get?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.467
Having to dump the warp core

25:36.535 --> 25:38.435
has to be the low point
of any day.

25:38.503 --> 25:40.903
Maybe it's me.

25:40.972 --> 25:45.033
Maybe l'm asking
for this trouble somehow.

25:45.110 --> 25:48.045
Or maybe it's just
a string of bad luck.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.549
Sensors have picked up
a polymetallic object.

25:53.618 --> 25:54.983
Could be the core.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.987
That's the warp signature,
all right,

25:57.055 --> 26:00.821
but there's something else
out there...a ship.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.860
According to sensors,
it has the same energy signature

26:02.928 --> 26:04.828
as the Caatati ships.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.864
Maybe they're guarding it
for us.

26:06.965 --> 26:09.058
Right.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.895
l see it.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.841
What do they think
they're doing?

26:17.909 --> 26:19.877
They're trying to put
a tractor beam on it.

26:20.011 --> 26:22.844
This is the Shuttle Cochrane
to the Caatati vessel.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.211
Please respond.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.113
Don't come any closer.

26:26.184 --> 26:28.277
We're performing
a salvage operation.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.480
Oh, what a coincidence--
so are we.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.147
l'm afraid we got here first.

26:32.223 --> 26:35.021
Don't interfere
or we'll open fire.

26:35.093 --> 26:38.085
Don't you realize
that core is highly unstable?

26:38.163 --> 26:39.630
lf you try to tractor it
like that,

26:39.698 --> 26:41.791
you could cause
an antimatter explosion.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.131
They're not answering.

26:45.203 --> 26:46.534
ldiots!

26:46.605 --> 26:48.573
We have to stop them
from destroying the core.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.040
l'm going to try to disrupt
their tractor beam.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.139
lt's working.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.675
What was that?

27:01.753 --> 27:04.813
They sent an antimatter pulse
back through our particle beam.

27:04.889 --> 27:05.947
Warning.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.492
Structural integrity field
has been compromised.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.960
Now at 53 percent and falling.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.998
Hull breach
in two minutes 20 seconds.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.862
Reroute power from the
propulsion and weapon systems.

27:16.968 --> 27:20.267
Warning. Hull breach in
two minutes, ten seconds.

27:20.338 --> 27:21.396
No effect.

27:23.575 --> 27:27.534
Warning. The structural
integrity field has collapsed.

27:27.612 --> 27:29.739
Hull breach in two minutes.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.180
We have to get out of here!

27:32.250 --> 27:35.811
Warning. Hull breach
in one minute, 50 seconds...

27:45.630 --> 27:48.622
Computer, send a distress call
to Voyager.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.667
Give them our coordinates.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.331
Computer, respond.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.498
The com systems must be down.

27:58.043 --> 28:00.204
Transporters are still on line.

28:00.278 --> 28:01.210
Stand by to energize.

28:05.650 --> 28:07.174
Energize.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.670
Paris to Voyager.

28:33.745 --> 28:35.804
Do you read me?

28:38.183 --> 28:40.413
Please respond.

28:40.485 --> 28:41.850
Paris to Voyager.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.080
lt's no use.

28:43.154 --> 28:45.952
The com system in these suits
won't carry that far.

28:48.493 --> 28:51.223
When they get
the impulse engines repaired,

28:51.296 --> 28:53.025
they'll come looking for us.

28:53.098 --> 28:55.726
Well, l don't plan
on just drifting here,

28:55.800 --> 28:58.394
hoping somebody will come along
and rescue us.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.030
There must be something
we can do.

29:01.139 --> 29:02.663
Agreed.

29:05.110 --> 29:09.376
lf we could interplex
the com systems in both suits,

29:09.447 --> 29:13.543
we might be able to create
a phased carrier wave.

29:13.618 --> 29:16.553
Voyager would read
the signature

29:16.621 --> 29:18.452
and know it's from us.

29:18.523 --> 29:19.956
Good idea.

29:20.024 --> 29:22.015
Let me access your controls.

29:23.661 --> 29:25.856
l thought you'd never ask.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.864
That's it.

29:47.852 --> 29:53.518
This would be a lot easier
if l had a hyperspanner.

29:53.591 --> 29:54.785
Hold still.

29:59.330 --> 30:01.730
Why is it we have
to get beamed into space

30:01.800 --> 30:03.791
in environmental suits

30:03.868 --> 30:07.929
before l can initiate
first contact procedures?

30:08.006 --> 30:12.136
Why is it that if we're alone
for more than 30 seconds,

30:12.210 --> 30:14.235
you start thinking
about contact?

30:14.312 --> 30:17.679
Oh. That is not fair.

30:17.749 --> 30:21.981
The other day in Engineering,
l must have gone...

30:22.086 --> 30:25.249
four minutes before l started
thinking about it.

30:26.691 --> 30:28.591
Okay...

30:28.660 --> 30:31.754
l'm ready to initiate
the carrier wave.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.022
Sorry.

30:37.769 --> 30:38.758
Better?

30:40.471 --> 30:41.995
Yeah.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.540
Let's hope
it's still that strong

30:44.609 --> 30:46.873
by the time
it gets to Voyager.

31:02.293 --> 31:03.590
Come in.

31:06.898 --> 31:09.526
Would you like tea or coffee?

31:09.601 --> 31:11.159
l have no need
to ingest liquids.

31:11.236 --> 31:13.329
l still receive energy
from the Borg alcove.

31:13.404 --> 31:14.336
My understanding is

31:14.405 --> 31:16.703
that you're almost ready
to begin eating food.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.667
That is what the Doctor says.

31:20.745 --> 31:22.372
Why have you asked me here?

31:22.447 --> 31:25.280
Whenever there's
an accident on the ship--

31:25.350 --> 31:27.784
even a minor one--
we investigate it

31:27.852 --> 31:30.980
in order to minimize the chances
of its happening again.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.522
A prudent course of action.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.581
l didn't have a chance
to talk to Lieutenant Torres

31:34.659 --> 31:35.626
before she left the ship,

31:35.693 --> 31:38.218
so...l wanted to ask you
some questions

31:38.296 --> 31:40.526
about what happened
in Engineering.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.864
Sensor logs indicate
that tachyons

31:43.935 --> 31:45.630
were leaking into the warp core.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.432
Do you have any idea
how it started?

31:47.505 --> 31:48.938
No.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.941
We had reconfigured
the deflector shield

31:51.009 --> 31:51.998
to emit tachyon bursts.

31:52.143 --> 31:54.111
The procedure
must've triggered the leak.

31:54.178 --> 31:56.146
Who was controlling
the tachyon bursts?

31:56.214 --> 31:57.545
Ensign Vorik.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.276
What were you doing?

31:59.350 --> 32:01.875
Monitoring the transwarp
frequencies.

32:01.986 --> 32:04.784
And did you at any time
access deflector control?

32:07.425 --> 32:09.893
You believe l'm responsible
for the accident,

32:09.961 --> 32:12.293
that l deliberately
sabotaged the ship.

32:12.363 --> 32:14.297
You're like the others.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.333
You see me as a threat.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.935
l won't lie to you.

32:21.005 --> 32:22.199
Part of me is suspicious.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.070
We've dealt
with tachyon fields before

32:24.142 --> 32:25.803
and never had
this kind of problem.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.937
Captain, l am unaccustomed
to deception.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.911
Among the Borg,
it was impossible.

32:30.982 --> 32:31.971
There were no lies,

32:32.050 --> 32:34.678
no secrets, and l assure you

32:34.752 --> 32:37.312
l had nothing to do with
the accident in Engineering.

32:46.331 --> 32:48.629
l believe you.
Thank you.

32:50.902 --> 32:53.894
l am finding it
a difficult challenge

32:53.972 --> 32:56.406
to integrate into this group.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.738
lt is full
of complex social structures

32:58.810 --> 33:00.243
that are unfamiliar to me.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.437
Compared with the Borg,

33:01.479 --> 33:03.504
this crew is inefficient
and contentious.

33:05.149 --> 33:09.882
But it is capable of...
surprising acts of compassion.

33:09.954 --> 33:14.254
Unexpected acts of kindness
are common among our group.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.725
That's one of the ways
we define ourselves.

33:20.031 --> 33:21.498
ls there anything more?

33:21.566 --> 33:22.794
Yes.

33:22.867 --> 33:26.530
We still have to find out
what caused the tachyon leak.

33:26.604 --> 33:29.573
Tell me what you remember
about the power fluctuations

33:29.640 --> 33:31.107
in the propulsion system.

33:45.189 --> 33:47.419
This isn't anything
like the simulations

33:47.492 --> 33:49.050
we had at the Academy.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.289
They felt peaceful...

33:53.364 --> 33:56.265
like floating in the womb...

33:59.237 --> 34:01.467
but right now,

34:01.572 --> 34:04.666
l'm feeling a little sick
to my stomach.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.179
You dropped out too soon.

34:09.246 --> 34:10.839
ln the third year,

34:10.915 --> 34:15.181
there's a six- week course
of actual space walks,

34:15.253 --> 34:17.516
so you can get used to them.

34:17.588 --> 34:20.920
l never would've lasted
to the third year.

34:21.025 --> 34:24.824
lf l hadn't dropped out,
they would've asked me to leave.

34:26.464 --> 34:28.431
l wish l'd known you then.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.659
You'd have hated me.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.635
l can't imagine a time

34:32.703 --> 34:35.069
l wouldn't have
found you fascinating.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.478
What the hell was that?

34:42.914 --> 34:45.109
More ion turbulence.

34:45.183 --> 34:50.449
Warning. Oxygen level
at 1 14 millibars.

34:50.521 --> 34:53.513
My oxygen supply is leaking.

34:54.891 --> 34:58.293
Warning. Oxygen level
at 93 millibars.

34:58.362 --> 35:00.489
We'll have to share mine.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.871
Are you getting air now?

35:13.344 --> 35:14.470
Yes.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.207
Much better.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.840
Thanks.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.220
What's wrong?

35:23.287 --> 35:27.519
The turbulence must
have damaged my suit, too.

35:27.592 --> 35:30.891
l should have at least
24 hours worth of oxygen,

35:30.962 --> 35:33.624
but there's only about
a half hour left.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.336
Engineering to Captain Janeway.

35:43.407 --> 35:44.499
Yes, Ensign.

35:44.575 --> 35:45.542
l'm pleased to inform you

35:45.610 --> 35:47.077
that impulse power
should be restored

35:47.145 --> 35:48.305
within the hour.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.347
Good news. Let me know as soon
as the engines are on line.

35:50.414 --> 35:51.881
Yes, ma'am.

35:51.949 --> 35:55.282
Captain, l believe l've found
the cause of the accident--

35:55.353 --> 35:58.186
erratic fluctuations
in the ship's warp power.

35:58.256 --> 36:01.020
When tachyon levels rose
to a resonant frequency,

36:01.125 --> 36:02.524
core pressure increased.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.528
Then it was an accident.

36:05.763 --> 36:07.663
Come in.

36:07.732 --> 36:08.994
Captain, we've picked up

36:09.066 --> 36:11.193
a carrier wave
with a Starfleet signature.

36:11.269 --> 36:12.861
l'd guess it's Tom and B'Elanna,
but they're not

36:12.970 --> 36:13.868
answering our hails.

36:14.005 --> 36:14.869
They may be in trouble.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.234
As soon as we get
impulse power...

36:16.307 --> 36:19.003
Tuvok to the Captain.
Can you come to the Bridge?

36:19.076 --> 36:20.202
On my way.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.846
We're being approached
by an armada of Caatati ships.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.910
They're hailing us.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.614
On screen.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.122
Hello, Captain.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.318
You've brought some friends.

36:35.393 --> 36:36.826
Needy friends.

36:36.894 --> 36:40.159
We're hoping
you'll offer us more supplies.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.290
l made it clear last time
that we couldn't

36:42.366 --> 36:44.926
possibly provide you
with enough for all your ships.

36:45.002 --> 36:46.333
And l had to accept that

36:46.404 --> 36:49.202
because your ship
is more powerful than ours,

36:49.273 --> 36:51.241
but the situation has changed,
hasn't it?

36:51.309 --> 36:53.573
You seem to be
at a disadvantage now.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.737
We have your warp core.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.075
You can't escape.

36:57.148 --> 37:00.140
l'm hoping that will make you
more generous.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.982
We've given you
everything we can spare.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.579
Return the core,
and we'll be on our way.

37:05.656 --> 37:08.750
One of our ships might not seem
threatening to you,

37:08.826 --> 37:13.126
but l assure you, 27 can inflict
considerable damage.

37:13.197 --> 37:15.131
We are desperate.

37:15.199 --> 37:17.861
Prepare to send us food, weapons

37:17.935 --> 37:20.267
and your entire supply
of thorium.

37:20.338 --> 37:22.602
And that Borg
you're protecting--

37:22.673 --> 37:23.867
we want her, too.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.136
There are many
who would enjoy a chance

37:26.210 --> 37:28.644
to repay one of them
for what they did to us.

37:38.923 --> 37:42.051
l'm lowering the oxygen ratio.

37:42.126 --> 37:45.186
That should give us
a few more minutes.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.528
l'm feeling...

37:48.599 --> 37:50.533
kind of groggy.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.126
Oxygen deprivation.

37:53.204 --> 37:56.173
And you're lowering it?

37:56.240 --> 38:00.108
We have to try to make it
last as long as possible.

38:00.177 --> 38:03.340
lt's ironic, isn't it?

38:04.749 --> 38:06.717
What?

38:06.784 --> 38:10.049
Today...

38:10.121 --> 38:13.682
the Day of Honor...

38:13.758 --> 38:17.524
is the day
that l'm going to die.

38:17.595 --> 38:20.325
We are not going to die.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.958
Would you stop
talking like that?

38:23.034 --> 38:25.628
We have to face up to it, Tom.

38:28.239 --> 38:31.003
There's something
l've been wanting to ask you.

38:31.075 --> 38:33.669
Well, now's the time.

38:35.446 --> 38:38.506
When we first met...

38:38.582 --> 38:42.416
you didn't have
a very high opinion of me.

38:42.486 --> 38:46.422
That's putting it mildly.

38:46.490 --> 38:52.588
l thought you were an arrogant,
self- absorbed pig.

38:54.365 --> 38:57.425
Flattery won't get you
any more oxygen.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.098
Do you think l've changed?

39:03.174 --> 39:04.334
A lot.

39:06.210 --> 39:09.509
Now you're a stubborn,
domineering pig.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.047
l'm just kidding.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.556
There l go again...

39:21.625 --> 39:24.025
just pushing you away.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.659
You were right about me.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.899
lt's what l do...

39:37.675 --> 39:40.542
push people away.

39:40.611 --> 39:44.604
Well, it's a surefire way
of not getting hurt.

39:45.616 --> 39:47.277
What a coward l am.

39:49.019 --> 39:51.010
Shh...

40:11.242 --> 40:12.834
Our weapons are more
powerful than theirs.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.309
l say we fight.

40:14.378 --> 40:15.936
Maybe if we give them something.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.047
Like what?

40:17.114 --> 40:19.344
l can't imagine what
would satisfy them now.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.544
l will go.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.246
They asked for me.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.982
lf l surrender myself,
perhaps they'll let you leave.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.318
That's very generous,

40:27.391 --> 40:29.154
but l will not turn
you over to them.

40:29.226 --> 40:30.557
l was only offering

40:30.628 --> 40:33.495
to do what would be best
for this group.

40:33.564 --> 40:34.929
You're part of this group now

40:34.999 --> 40:36.557
and we're going to protect you.

40:36.634 --> 40:37.931
lt's time
to stop talking about this.

40:38.002 --> 40:39.993
Tom and B'Elanna are in trouble
and we have to find them.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.470
Tuvok, what's the status
of our weapons array?

40:42.540 --> 40:44.565
Weapons are
at the ready, Captain,

40:44.642 --> 40:46.633
but our shield strength
is extremely low.

40:46.710 --> 40:49.201
We'll have to shut down
nonessential systems.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.804
Reroute power to the shields.

40:50.881 --> 40:52.280
We're going to fight.

40:52.349 --> 40:53.873
That might not be necessary.

40:53.951 --> 40:57.751
Caatati technology is dependent
on thorium isotopes.

40:57.822 --> 40:59.847
lf they had enough, they could
become self- sustaining.

40:59.924 --> 41:01.892
But we don't have
that much thorium to give them.

41:01.992 --> 41:03.550
When the Borg
assimilated the Caatati,

41:03.594 --> 41:06.654
the survivors lost their ability
to replicate the isotopes.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.254
But l have retained
that knowledge.

41:08.332 --> 41:11.529
l could design an energy matrix
that would produce

41:11.602 --> 41:13.092
thorium in large quantities.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.730
lf you've had this knowledge all
along, why didn't you say so?

41:17.341 --> 41:20.037
l am not accustomed
to thinking that way.

41:20.110 --> 41:22.442
Borg do not consider
giving technology away,

41:22.513 --> 41:23.878
only assimilating it.

41:23.948 --> 41:27.179
And what do you suppose
made you consider it now?

41:29.286 --> 41:31.186
l am not certain.

41:31.255 --> 41:36.693
Maybe...it was just
an unexpected act of kindness.

41:38.262 --> 41:40.890
Work with Vorik
to build the energy matrix,

41:40.965 --> 41:42.125
while l convince the Caatati

41:42.199 --> 41:43.632
there's a better way
out of this.

41:48.939 --> 41:53.137
This matrix will produce
944 grams of thorium per day.

41:53.210 --> 41:54.734
Now you can power
all your systems

41:54.812 --> 41:58.248
and begin to rebuild
your replication technology.

41:58.315 --> 42:00.681
Will you allow us to leave?

42:00.784 --> 42:04.379
One device isn't enough
for all our ships.

42:04.421 --> 42:05.911
Using this matrix
as a template,

42:05.990 --> 42:08.151
you can construct
as many as you like.

42:08.225 --> 42:09.692
We can provide you
with components

42:09.760 --> 42:11.887
and specifications.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.228
You're free to go.

42:17.601 --> 42:19.592
And thank you.

42:20.771 --> 42:22.762
You're welcome.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.955
Tom...

42:49.633 --> 42:50.600
Come on.

42:50.668 --> 42:53.262
Open your eyes.

42:53.337 --> 42:57.330
Warning. Oxygen level
at 87 millibars.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.377
l was having a dream.

43:00.444 --> 43:03.413
There's something l have to say.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.606
Me, too.

43:06.650 --> 43:10.347
l'm glad
the last thing l'll see is you.

43:10.421 --> 43:15.188
l've been a coward
about everything...

43:15.259 --> 43:18.922
everything that really matters.

43:19.029 --> 43:22.521
No. You're being
a little hard on yourself.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.033
No.

43:24.101 --> 43:26.501
l'm going to die...

43:26.570 --> 43:29.733
without a shred of honor,

43:29.807 --> 43:32.241
and for the first time
in my life,

43:32.309 --> 43:34.004
that really bothers me.

43:37.982 --> 43:40.416
So l have to tell you something.
l...

43:40.484 --> 43:45.217
Warning. Oxygen level
at 7 1 millibars.

43:48.425 --> 43:50.655
l have to tell you the truth.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.093
The truth about what?

44:00.304 --> 44:02.932
l love you.

44:06.944 --> 44:08.468
Say something.

44:12.616 --> 44:15.414
You picked a great time
to tell me.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.715
Voyager to Tom Paris.

44:47.785 --> 44:49.753
Tom, do you read me?
Respond.

44:54.391 --> 44:55.722
We're here.

44:55.793 --> 44:58.091
Prepare to beam aboard.
