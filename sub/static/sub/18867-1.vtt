WEBVTT

00:03.462 --> 00:05.703
(roaring)

00:27.694 --> 00:30.812
(mooing)

00:44.169 --> 00:46.126
(men yelling indistinctly)

02:10.297 --> 02:13.665
(dramatic music)

02:31.443 --> 02:33.229
Did you fall off again?

02:33.445 --> 02:37.279
I'm practicing a
new kind of dismount.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.064
Jesus, no.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.365
Jesus, yes.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.238
We're out here playing
some kind of goddamn

02:42.454 --> 02:45.822
cowboys and my
horse can't keep up.

02:46.041 --> 02:46.906
Dammit!

02:47.501 --> 02:49.242
Oh Scott, what are we doing?

02:49.461 --> 02:50.576
Katie...

02:52.381 --> 02:56.170
I think we're
having a heart attack.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.173
No, you're having
a thrill again.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.720
This is just one of
your goddamn thrills!

03:01.932 --> 03:04.173
Katie, I don't make
the fucking rules!

03:05.268 --> 03:08.852
I'm just one of the players.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.556
Oh, great one, this
isn't the real thing?

03:11.775 --> 03:15.769
No, it's a goosy
situation, baby.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.773
Scott, damn it.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.946
Are you scared?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.860
Would I be scared?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.662
(laughs)

03:29.084 --> 03:31.371
Oh Scott, I'm afraid.

03:31.795 --> 03:32.876
Cotton!

03:33.088 --> 03:35.079
Yeah, what the
hell is going on?

03:38.176 --> 03:41.714
Oh, great one, oh,
tell me everything.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.848
Tell me again from the time
I was born in your arms.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.807
(chuckles)

03:52.482 --> 03:54.564
Will you let
me bite your lip?

03:54.776 --> 03:55.891
Is it all right?

03:56.111 --> 03:59.320
Oh, I don't
think it'll kill me.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.152
I don't know, it's
pretty potent stuff.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.451
Let me try...

04:15.714 --> 04:17.671
What are you
doing on your butts?

04:17.882 --> 04:19.668
Scott, he thinks he's
having a heart attack.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.718
You bet you
1,000 to one he is.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.011
Maybe we better give
him a couple of shots.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.588
Just in case.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.344
Just in case what?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.927
Just in case you need them.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.762
Pull up his shirt for me.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.685
This will have to
go in the belly.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.642
Oh, goddamnit,
not in the belly.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.602
In the arm, in the arm, Cotton.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.858
No, it's got to
go in the belly part.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.735
Goddamnit, I'll kick you
right in the head, Cotton.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.568
Not in the belly, that shot
does not go in the belly!

04:47.788 --> 04:49.950
Stop it, just stop it now!

04:51.708 --> 04:54.166
Just this try
to be brave part.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.583
Oh, brave.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.379
(laughs)

04:59.883 --> 05:03.421
You know, honey, I was
seeing one of those big

05:03.637 --> 05:05.719
rabies shots.

05:05.931 --> 05:06.966
You ever seen one of those?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.092
Yeah, yeah.

05:08.308 --> 05:12.051
Oh goddamnit,
they're awesome things.

05:13.355 --> 05:17.314
Oh, Scott, this is
the real thing, damn you.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.397
Listen, honey,
if I have to go,

05:24.908 --> 05:26.694
what'll you do?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.446
I will not cry.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.074
I will not wear ugly black.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.033
And I will go forward
with your strength

05:35.252 --> 05:38.745
and live life to
the fullest, sir.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.752
You'll be good about this?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.796
Oh, I have to.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.673
Those are the rules.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.051
I sure would
like to change them

05:50.642 --> 05:52.724
and take you with me.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.269
Oh, I'll go.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.438
But you're not going anywhere.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.641
(beeping)

06:00.861 --> 06:02.443
Where am I now?

06:02.654 --> 06:05.646
I mean, what did it do to me?

06:06.157 --> 06:09.070
Well, you won't be
playing King Kong anymore.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.908
What about Mighty Mouse?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.499
Don't know about
Mighty Mouse yet.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.968
Oh, there's my baby.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.598
No, no, no.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.800
Might be catching.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.307
Will you shut up
and listen to me?

06:41.526 --> 06:43.688
I don't want
to listen to you.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.319
You're saying a lot of shit.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.065
Unfortunately, it is shit.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.026
Tough, ugly shit.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.240
And that's not all of it.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.204
Okay, you're saying my
fucking heart's no good.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.752
I'm listening!

07:03.757 --> 07:07.751
The rest of it is that
you don't get a new one.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.926
Of course you do.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.754
They do it every day.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.888
Not true.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.637
That's just not true.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.648
Over 60, you don't get a heart.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.647
(laughs)

07:25.862 --> 07:27.648
You're joking.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.487
You're not joking.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.745
Who made that rule?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.919
I don't know,
common sense, I guess.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.715
God!

07:51.471 --> 07:52.802
Can it be broken?

07:53.515 --> 07:55.005
Not really.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.890
Hey, what are
you bawling about?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.017
It's just...

08:03.233 --> 08:05.645
(dog barking)

08:10.031 --> 08:11.521
Does she know about it?

08:11.741 --> 08:13.607
She's no dummy, Scott.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.158
Look at her.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.242
God, she's beautiful.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.698
Full of health.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.626
Damn it, son of a bitch.

08:33.722 --> 08:38.558
Katie, I hate for you
to see me like this.

08:38.977 --> 08:39.682
The hell is that?

08:39.894 --> 08:40.929
What is that?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.886
Oh come on, not a number,
for Christ's sake.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.140
They don't mean a goddamn...

08:44.357 --> 08:45.062
son of a bitch!

08:45.275 --> 08:46.606
Go ahead, inject him.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.185
You're a big boy, you know
the facts and consequences.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.941
Facts and
consequences my ass.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.694
Scotty, we love you

08:54.909 --> 08:57.071
and I want you to
think about that.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.448
Kiss me, baby,
kiss me. (laughs)

09:06.171 --> 09:08.754
I'm sorry, Fred, I'm sorry.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.205
I'll be back soon, pal.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.631
Okay, okay.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.513
Helen, I'm sorry, I apologize.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.882
Just blew my top.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.437
Katie.

09:31.905 --> 09:35.489
That feels wonderful. (laughs)

09:37.619 --> 09:40.031
Why do I love you so?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.537
Come on now.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.489
Give me the lip.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.743
This is a no no, no no.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.666
I'll tell you
when it's a no no.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.368
Come on, put out your
lip, put out your lip.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.955
Come on, I need (mumbling).

09:53.009 --> 09:54.716
(groans)

09:56.137 --> 09:58.219
(mumbling)

10:05.688 --> 10:07.929
That makes me feel better.

10:08.691 --> 10:12.355
(serene music)

10:25.875 --> 10:27.582
That's about it.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.869
All right, you make the
changes and patch them to me.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.298
No, no, no, right
here at the ranch.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.428
I need you.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.430
Right.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.490
Honey, that was beautiful.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.869
But a little more spur
and a little less love

11:08.084 --> 11:10.621
and you might get a better
performance out of him.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.371
Well, he's just
being a bad boy today.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.835
Just like you sometimes.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.296
(laughs)

11:19.512 --> 11:20.923
Maybe you're right.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.255
Let me see you ride
him around again.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.472
(serene music)

12:14.067 --> 12:16.104
Where have you been?

12:17.403 --> 12:22.318
Oh, I, uh, I went to
visit an old sweetheart of mine.

12:24.118 --> 12:28.157
No, I just, just
riding around, roaming.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.530
You're just a bad boy.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.741
Katie, let's go for a walk.

12:32.961 --> 12:33.917
But you can't.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.961
Why not?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.788
You just can't.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.714
Ah, come on.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.212
Can you?

12:42.720 --> 12:46.088
Katie, I want to
go walking with you.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.431
You sure?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.806
I'm sure.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.731
Okay.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.309
Well, who backs up
first, you or me?

12:59.529 --> 13:00.519
You.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.320
Okay, boss.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.367
Come on.

13:10.957 --> 13:11.867
(laughs)

13:12.041 --> 13:13.827
How do we jump over this?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.334
You're the genius.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.412
You'll figure something out.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.377
Goddamnit.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.426
Oh, goddamnit. (laughs)

13:25.388 --> 13:27.095
Oh God,

13:28.516 --> 13:30.974
God, look how beautiful it is.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.760
I love this country.

13:34.147 --> 13:38.516
Katie, I want to ask
your forgiveness.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.776
You're scaring me, great one.

13:43.948 --> 13:48.909
I just want you to
remember all the good times.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.537
That's every single second.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.576
Once more.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.999
Not even once more.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.182
Oh, my love.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.564
A lot of good things are...

14:27.325 --> 14:29.737
...getting away from me, Katie.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.622
It's no big deal, Scott.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.162
(laughs)

14:41.381 --> 14:42.837
You're right.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.920
It's no big deal.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.843
(laughs)

15:07.198 --> 15:09.735
I'm no goddamn Hemingway.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.121
I'm not even Norman Mailer.

15:20.711 --> 15:21.917
Dear...

15:24.215 --> 15:25.546
...Katie.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.181
(gunshot)

15:43.943 --> 15:45.525
No, don't go up there!

15:45.736 --> 15:46.976
Please, Mrs. Scott,
I think we ought to.

15:47.196 --> 15:47.856
No, don't go!

15:48.072 --> 15:48.812
Please let us.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.444
No, wait, no, don't come.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.445
Look at me.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.742
Don't come up here.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.115
Ma'am I think we should.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.822
Just go, please, just go!

15:59.250 --> 16:04.165
Katie, my love, I short
changed you the other day

16:04.380 --> 16:08.544
when I said you put
the cherry on my cake.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.256
You are my cake.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.092
And now I have to
kiss you goodbye.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.016
(sobbing) Oh Scott, don't say
these awful things.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.639
We are May - December lovers

16:20.855 --> 16:23.472
and have been from day one.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.309
We used to joke about
it, if and when,

16:27.528 --> 16:31.442
and you always said
you'd forgive me

16:31.699 --> 16:34.157
if I felt this was necessary.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.824
Katie, it is necessary.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.410
I have no options.

16:41.626 --> 16:46.587
It's necessary that
you hold me and love me,

16:46.839 --> 16:50.048
great one, you son of a bitch!

16:51.928 --> 16:54.841
Oh, Scott, love me.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.387
Oh, Scott, let me in, please.

17:00.603 --> 17:03.265
Oh God, what have I done?

17:03.731 --> 17:06.393
God never comes for suicides.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.895
It wasn't a suicide.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.146
It was a mercy killing.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.865
I gave myself a euthanasia shot.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.403
Very much against the rules.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.200
I don't like rules.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.330
How unusual.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.837
You must be the very first
person who ever felt that way.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.590
Who are you?

17:37.515 --> 17:41.759
Well, the devil has her
tail and angels...

17:43.521 --> 17:45.387
...have wings.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.646
(laughs)

17:50.861 --> 17:53.193
You, you're an angel?

17:57.785 --> 18:00.026
(laughs)

18:01.247 --> 18:05.741
Well, I must say,
you're a gorgeous one.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.536
Thank you.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.876
Gorgeous is a nice word.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.207
(laughs)

18:14.427 --> 18:16.509
I'm a fledgling angel.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.553
Oh.

18:19.181 --> 18:24.142
And you are my first case.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.011
Isn't that interesting?

18:27.231 --> 18:30.223
I was Katie's first case.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.943
They have shrouded
themselves in sorrow.

18:37.575 --> 18:41.534
In his last hours in
1890, Crow Foot, the great warrior

18:41.746 --> 18:43.362
also buried here.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.781
Spoke of life, not of death.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.825
What is life?

18:49.045 --> 18:52.379
It is the flash of a
firefly in the night.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.332
It is the breath of a
buffalo in the winter time.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.128
(continues speaking
indistinctly)

19:07.688 --> 19:09.224
Scott.

19:18.991 --> 19:23.952
Katie, take a deep breath
and a deep, deep seat.

19:26.749 --> 19:30.458
Ta Da! (laughs)

19:30.670 --> 19:32.206
I'm back.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.538
Please look at me.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.498
It's me.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.879
I'm back.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.210
Don't be scared.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.922
Look, it's me.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.510
(dog barking)

19:45.726 --> 19:47.182
Remember how we used
to joke and speculate

19:47.395 --> 19:50.137
about how it would
be when I was dead?

19:50.356 --> 19:55.146
Well the joke is, (laughs)
it's exactly like that.

19:58.989 --> 20:03.574
Honey, you're wearing
black and you're crying.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.869
And I thought there wasn't
going to be any of that.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.583
I know, I'm sorry, Scott.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.671
They all insist
that you be sad.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.548
But I am sad.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.425
I don't like that.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.345
Are you all right, Kate?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.177
Fine, I'm fine.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.888
Honey, now you've
gone and done it.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.474
Just bow your head sadly.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.151
That'll make them
all feel better.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.274
You'll have to go
and do something.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.608
You know, they say
it's mandatory, got all

20:44.827 --> 20:47.194
kinds of rules and laws up here.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.278
Will I see you again.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.829
Absolutely.

20:51.917 --> 20:52.907
You promise?

20:53.127 --> 20:54.788
I promise.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.246
Katie, do you...

21:01.135 --> 21:02.375
Do you still love me?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.753
Oh yes, I love you.

21:04.972 --> 21:08.556
I really want to thank
you for this, this funeral.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.806
I mean, it's better
than I imagined.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.603
I mean, right to the letter.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.522
I mean, the mountains,
the buffalo robe,

21:16.734 --> 21:20.853
and I want to thank you
for inviting Gambler.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.779
That was sweet.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.069
He shall return again
and again, for he has

21:30.289 --> 21:32.200
never left us, he will live on.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.578
For the spirit knows no death.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.876
The spirit laughs at death.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.376
Our eyes will see him,
for that is the way

21:40.591 --> 21:42.798
of all great spirits.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.927
So do not grieve, my brothers.

21:46.972 --> 21:50.010
Do not grieve, my sisters.

21:50.893 --> 21:55.308
Great Scott, the
great Scott lives.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.150
Scott, hey, hey.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.486
Hey, look at the camera.

22:03.864 --> 22:04.945
That's great.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.488
You too, Scott.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.529
That's great.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.032
That's just terrific.

22:12.373 --> 22:15.536
(Scott) God, you look
good enough to eat.

22:16.544 --> 22:19.127
But of course that's probably
out of the question now.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.579
Scott, am I doing this?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.048
Am I making you up?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.801
Honey, I don't know the
physics of the phenomenon.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.805
But are you dead?

22:31.016 --> 22:32.848
Yes, Katie, God
was going to get me,

22:33.060 --> 22:36.018
so I beat him to
it with a 12 gauge.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.722
But you could
have taken pills.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.225
Real men don't eat quiche.

22:42.653 --> 22:44.815
Well that's fine
for you, Scott.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.568
What about me?

22:49.034 --> 22:51.446
What am I going to do now?

22:51.912 --> 22:53.494
Stand up.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.412
Stand up on your feet.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.615
Come on, come on, stand up.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.200
Come on!

23:00.337 --> 23:02.419
Now, shoulders back.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.338
Straight back.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.257
Stand tall.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.046
Titties out.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.344
(laughs)

23:10.848 --> 23:15.558
Now, where were we going
before all this happened?

23:18.314 --> 23:20.100
I can't go there now.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.691
Honey, it's your favorite
place in the whole world.

23:24.862 --> 23:27.854
I know, but I can't go.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.568
Why not?

23:32.161 --> 23:35.244
Well, because you're
out there on the prairie.

23:35.456 --> 23:39.700
(laughs) I'm not out there, I'm
not here, I'm not anywhere.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.036
Honey, I'm not people.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.293
I'm just a ghost.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.797
Come on.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.675
Go on.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.132
Will you come?

23:57.144 --> 23:59.135
I'm sure going to try.

24:02.983 --> 24:06.317
(serene music)

24:27.967 --> 24:29.253
That's the woman.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.085
She's the one, I'm sure,
I'm certain of that.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.920
(Scott) Katie, Katie, look.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.597
(laughs) I'm here.

24:37.184 --> 24:40.017
Oh, Scott, I hate this.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.266
Damn you and your shotgun.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.098
She's talking to someone,
but there is no one.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.432
Maybe on the land.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.394
Goddamnit, Katie,
I was nothing but a

24:49.613 --> 24:52.571
goddamn piece of meat.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.572
Big bang was absolutely right.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.619
Well you were
absolutely wrong.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.199
You are absolutely wrong.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.787
Look at you.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.960
You're here but you're not here.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.253
Yes, but I am here.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.919
Damn it, Scott, this stinks.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.048
No, you know what
it really does?

25:19.476 --> 25:20.682
It sucks!

25:21.937 --> 25:24.975
Please, don't use that word.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.397
It sucks.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.689
I'll find a way.

25:34.908 --> 25:35.989
I'll work it out.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.408
I promise you.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.573
Promise me?

25:40.789 --> 25:43.326
You can't even swim with me.

25:44.293 --> 25:48.912
Honey, we'll do it all again.

25:51.842 --> 25:54.675
I can hardly feel
it when you touch me.

25:57.181 --> 25:59.513
It's like a butterfly flew by.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.051
You're a ghost, Scott.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.645
Ghosts can't do it,
it's that simple.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.857
Katie, please, please
stop this kind of talk.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.901
You stop it.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.103
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

26:14.573 --> 26:16.940
You blew your head
off, I didn't.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.284
And you did this to us, not me.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.487
Katie, will you shut up?

26:22.706 --> 26:23.992
Shut up yourself.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.825
Katie, will you listen to me?

26:27.044 --> 26:28.626
I'm listening.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.124
(laughs) That's my girl.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.547
I'm your girl, all right.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.838
But you're not my
man, you're my ghost.

26:42.017 --> 26:45.806
So you do believe
I'm a ghost, huh?

26:47.481 --> 26:48.642
What else could you be?

26:48.857 --> 26:51.144
I mean, look at you.

26:51.819 --> 26:54.151
Honey, there are
stories about ghosts that

26:54.363 --> 26:57.151
come back in another body.

26:57.366 --> 27:00.529
Oh Jesus, Scott,
don't do that to me.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.860
Oh God, don't do that.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.448
If it's possible,
I want to try.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.499
Just think about it.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.917
In another body?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.672
You mean you'd take another body

27:16.593 --> 27:19.506
and with this body
you'd make love to me?

27:20.472 --> 27:21.337
You bet I would.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.719
I mean, if it's possible.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.516
I don't know, Scott.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.343
That's kinky stuff.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.770
We've never been kinky.

27:30.440 --> 27:35.059
Honey, we could
get married again.

27:35.821 --> 27:40.782
I mean, God, wouldn't
that be wonderful?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.610
What would you look like?

27:44.830 --> 27:46.662
Look like?

27:46.915 --> 27:48.246
Yes, look like.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.742
That's important.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.828
Would you be young?

27:54.131 --> 27:56.964
If you were offered a
choice, would you choose

27:57.176 --> 27:59.884
a young man?

28:00.179 --> 28:02.466
You know, Scott, I've
never really had one before.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.514
(laughs) Are you kidding?

28:05.851 --> 28:07.888
I was only 50.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.566
How young?

28:15.944 --> 28:17.685
I think very.

28:18.155 --> 28:22.490
Will he be blond
or brunet,

28:23.660 --> 28:24.695
redhead?

28:24.912 --> 28:26.994
Will he be tall, short?

28:27.206 --> 28:29.789
Whoa, hello there!

28:30.292 --> 28:31.782
Great, I must
look like I'm crazy

28:32.002 --> 28:33.584
talking to a beach full of sand.

28:33.795 --> 28:34.580
Do you need any help?

28:34.796 --> 28:35.911
Is there anything I can do?

28:36.131 --> 28:37.792
No thank you!

28:38.133 --> 28:40.591
I was just trying
to remember a poem.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.964
From here you look like
a very beautiful person!

28:43.180 --> 28:44.966
Wish there was
something I could do!

28:45.182 --> 28:47.594
No thank you,
I'm fine, thank you!

28:47.809 --> 28:48.970
Fuck off, kid!

28:49.311 --> 28:50.392
Ciao!

28:51.230 --> 28:54.393
(upbeat music)

28:56.109 --> 28:58.817
Oh, she's so...

28:59.029 --> 29:01.361
(Scott) Look Katie, I've been
thinking, wouldn't it be wonderful

29:01.573 --> 29:04.736
if we found someone
that looked like me?

29:04.952 --> 29:06.943
I mean, just a little bit?

29:07.162 --> 29:09.620
Okay, maybe younger.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.289
I can't talk to you here,
I'd look like an idiot.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.208
I like you when
you're listening.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.831
I've done more
than my share of that.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.753
What are you saying, Katie?

29:18.966 --> 29:20.422
I didn't say that.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.466
I couldn't have said that.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.468
I love to hear you talk.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.886
God, I love you.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.056
I never loved anybody before.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.388
Well, not as much.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.474
I know that now.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.021
Now you know this?

29:36.233 --> 29:38.065
Well. (laughs)

29:38.277 --> 29:41.611
It is marvelous to
see you, Mrs. Scott.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.898
May I sit with you
for a moment, please?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.108
Of course, your
honor, please do.

29:47.327 --> 29:50.740
Oh, this is going to take
a lot of getting used to.

29:51.331 --> 29:54.494
You know that when
we heard of the tragedy,

29:54.960 --> 29:59.500
we all gathered here,
all of us for a memorial.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.545
Many tears were shed.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.506
I'm sure he would have
liked that very much.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.258
Actually I would have.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.929
We are so pleased
that you are back.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.307
And you know, you should
treat every foot of this

30:15.522 --> 30:17.854
island as your home.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.854
Well thank you, we love
your island very much.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.561
That makes me very happy.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.738
Oh, I'm pleased to hear that.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.156
Good evening, your honor.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.826
Good evening, Mr. Garibaldi.

30:31.455 --> 30:34.823
Would you introduce us or
could I introduce myself?

30:35.042 --> 30:37.079
Katie, look at this.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.876
Look at this kid.

30:39.087 --> 30:42.375
Yes, of course, let
me do the introductions.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.879
Mrs. Scott, this
is Mr. Garibaldi.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.129
My name is Fausto.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.758
(laughs) You're
Fausto all right.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.759
And mine is Kate.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.091
Fausto, Katie.

30:54.311 --> 30:57.349
Take your hand away,
he's romancing you.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.101
Are you romancing me, Fausto?

31:00.317 --> 31:02.149
Katie, what, are you nuts?

31:02.361 --> 31:03.897
Look at the kid. (laughs)

31:04.112 --> 31:06.103
He's coming all over himself.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.323
Yes, 1, your
beauty demands it.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.279
Oh, you're the
young man who saw me

31:11.495 --> 31:13.111
on the beach working on my poem.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.996
Yes, I saw that and
I was fortunate enough

31:16.208 --> 31:17.494
to see much more.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.950
Oh, goddamnit, never, never.

31:20.170 --> 31:24.630
Now look, Katie, don't you
fuck around with this kid.

31:24.841 --> 31:25.956
That would kill me.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.009
Would you like to dance?

31:29.221 --> 31:31.212
No thank you, I
think I should get home

31:31.431 --> 31:32.842
and go to bed early.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.219
Oh, I'd like
that even better.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.016
That's all, you
son of a bitch.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.219
(thunders)

31:42.567 --> 31:44.774
What did you
say your name was?

31:44.986 --> 31:46.397
Fausto.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.691
No, Senor what?

31:49.032 --> 31:50.522
Garibaldi.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.076
Well good night,
Senor Garibaldi.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.126
That was fantastic. (laughs)

32:02.337 --> 32:03.793
I love it.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.871
Tell me, how many of
those do you have?

32:06.091 --> 32:07.832
A bunch.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.713
Well, they shouldn't be here.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.797
They should be in a vault
in New York or Hong Kong.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.717
No, if it were vaulted
in New York or Hong Kong

32:17.936 --> 32:19.802
then I couldn't play with them.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.305
How much are they worth?

32:23.525 --> 32:24.606
Well...

32:25.902 --> 32:29.395
...the sultan wants
that big mama very badly.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.855
But he always gets
everything he wants, and I

32:32.075 --> 32:34.533
don't think that's
very good for a person.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.405
Everything in here,

32:37.247 --> 32:39.204
if prices are holding up,

32:40.333 --> 32:44.748
$1,375,000 without the O'Dare.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.997
Oh, that's very impressive.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.132
Well, you'd better get
them off the island.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.302
Most of them
will be going soon.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.720
The buyers are coming
in and they're going to

32:55.932 --> 32:57.548
fight over them.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.428
They were just honoring
the untimely blowing

32:59.644 --> 33:01.681
off of your head.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.775
Darling, you're now
the chairman of the board.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.853
My entire empire.

33:11.198 --> 33:13.940
The whole damn thing.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.650
You know, this isn't a
five and dime operation.

33:16.870 --> 33:21.034
I mean, you'll have to,
god, you'll have to work.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.491
I shouldn't have
hit him like that.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.200
But it was fun.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.582
Boom, bang, just like Sugar Ray.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.037
I should have been a boxer.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.841
Have you any idea of
how much money we're worth?

33:33.428 --> 33:35.635
Must be a ton because an
awful lot of very important

33:35.847 --> 33:38.714
people are always kissing
your beautiful little ass.

33:38.934 --> 33:43.849
Honey, $2 billion.

33:48.276 --> 33:52.395
That's 2 billion.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.530
Why don't you go get
a body and ravish me?

33:55.742 --> 33:56.982
Just like the old days.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.113
I'll wait right here.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.196
I'll bet you it can be done.

34:02.415 --> 34:06.079
I just don't want to leave
you alone with that Fausto.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.123
Then zap him
and use his body.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.420
Zap him?

34:11.049 --> 34:13.460
You really like that punk, huh?

34:13.677 --> 34:16.510
Oh, no, but his face
when you take him out of it

34:16.721 --> 34:18.587
is really quite nice.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.223
And I can't tell for sure,
but his body looks like it

34:21.434 --> 34:23.344
might be a lot better
than just good.

34:24.353 --> 34:27.891
She's right,
he's not too bad.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.766
Besides, Katie likes the
way he's put together.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.943
He's kind of young for
her, but what the hell.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.612
It's her turn now.

34:35.949 --> 34:39.658
And the question is,
how do I kick him out?

34:43.915 --> 34:44.996
(laughs)

34:45.208 --> 34:47.290
I've got it, I've got it.

34:47.502 --> 34:51.120
All we have to do
is possess him.

34:51.630 --> 34:54.214
Find a way to zap him.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.876
My god, Scott.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.716
What the hell
is he doing here?

35:00.140 --> 35:04.225
Oh, honey, we can have
fun with that body.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.895
Fausto, your body is mine.

35:08.898 --> 35:09.888
Tell him to use sunblock.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.270
I don't want to
die of skin cancer.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.767
You will like him, Katie.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.445
I saw him go skinny
dipping the other night.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.317
(laughs)

35:18.533 --> 35:20.524
Oh please, Scott, stop it.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.655
Now see what you've made me do.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.828
All right, all right,
you tell him your problem.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.530
All right, I will.

35:26.750 --> 35:27.706
Okay.

35:28.418 --> 35:31.001
You must think I'm
crazy talking to myself.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.577
Well, I'm not.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.913
I'm talking to the ghost
of my dead husband.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.840
He's right there.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.551
You do think I'm crazy.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.098
All right, you were
skinny dipping last night.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.800
How about that?

35:47.979 --> 35:49.686
So, I was skinny dipping.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.605
Well how did I know about it?

35:51.816 --> 35:53.398
I guess you
were on the beach.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.480
No, I was in bed.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.561
He saw you.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.401
Well, if you say so.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.483
Oh, I do say so.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.194
Do you know what he wants?

36:05.413 --> 36:06.574
No.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.999
Oh shit. (laughs)

36:10.210 --> 36:13.123
He wants to
possess your body.

36:13.505 --> 36:18.420
Honey, honey, I don't
think he's quite grasping it.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.629
Well then you tell him.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.462
I prefer you possess me.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.639
See, I don't think
he's following us.

36:25.850 --> 36:26.760
I can't do it.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.558
I'm not strong enough.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.181
And I'm not wise enough.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.767
But it doesn't take brains.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.768
You know, you have
a nice head of hair.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.895
It'll be nice to
have that again.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.569
Look, I was just joking.

36:39.781 --> 36:42.022
Well I'm not,
get away from me.

36:42.951 --> 36:45.113
How are your teeth?

36:45.954 --> 36:48.696
Mr. Garibaldi,
I don't like you.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.618
That's good, not too tough.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.620
Don't drive him too far away.

36:52.836 --> 36:54.418
Scott, please.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.165
But I'm just anxious.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.294
My angel says I only
have a couple of days.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.671
So what do you say?

37:05.807 --> 37:07.138
All right.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.928
You want to know what
the crazy lady and her

37:09.144 --> 37:10.885
dead husband talk about?

37:11.104 --> 37:14.313
I'll tell you and you'll
probably like this part.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.435
He says you're not bad looking.

37:17.861 --> 37:18.601
Where is he?

37:18.820 --> 37:20.106
I'd like to thank him.

37:20.739 --> 37:21.695
There.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.571
Thank you.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.023
You're welcome.

37:25.535 --> 37:29.745
And then we discuss a
quick way for you to die.

37:30.331 --> 37:32.117
How do you like it so far?

37:32.333 --> 37:34.370
Well, just the handsome part.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.497
He just said not bad looking.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.209
What do you think?

37:41.676 --> 37:45.135
Well, the outside's fine.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.630
But the inside appears to stink.

37:48.850 --> 37:52.684
Honey, you don't have
to insult him. (laughs)

37:54.814 --> 37:56.054
Kate!

37:56.274 --> 37:58.140
Honey, look, it's Win.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.475
What a surprise, Winston!

38:00.695 --> 38:02.686
Hey, Katie!

38:02.906 --> 38:05.443
Win, Winston!

38:05.658 --> 38:07.365
Why are you so happy?

38:07.577 --> 38:09.284
I'm so glad to see him.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.828
(laughter)

38:11.998 --> 38:13.363
Let me look at you.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.957
You've held up pretty well.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.501
Those were his orders.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.792
You're more
beautiful than ever.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.748
How many times have
you said that in your

38:22.967 --> 38:24.708
long life, Win?

38:24.969 --> 38:26.050
We haven't met.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.752
I'm Winston Hill.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.554
Fausto Garibaldi.

38:29.766 --> 38:32.053
Come on, Win, I want
to show you around.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.804
Is there room for
four on this boat?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.806
No, you're right, four would slump us.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.057
You'd better swim.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.684
Oh, I'm sorry, I should
have stayed on board.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.311
No, you should be
right where you are.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.484
No, no, no, Win
should go home and the

38:42.695 --> 38:44.902
kid should stay here and
be wrapped up in cotton

38:45.114 --> 38:47.321
until we need him.

38:47.575 --> 38:51.113
Kate, when I
heard, I was stunned.

38:53.414 --> 38:57.032
Well, what else would
the great Scott do?

38:57.752 --> 38:59.663
He loved Hemingway.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.836
He always admired the
way Hemingway did it.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.880
But he's all right now.

39:04.092 --> 39:06.880
I have it on good authority
he's an angel first class.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.177
On his way to
becoming a good looking,

39:09.389 --> 39:11.972
dark haired young man.

39:12.517 --> 39:16.260
Win, something you
should look into.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.804
He sure loved you.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.682
I still do.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.731
What are you doing here, Win?

39:25.947 --> 39:26.937
Are you taking a vacation?

39:27.156 --> 39:28.863
No, I came to see you.

39:29.075 --> 39:30.565
Me?

39:30.785 --> 39:33.152
You've come halfway around
the world just to see me?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.328
I wanted to talk to you
in person about Scott's

39:35.540 --> 39:37.827
business, your business now.

39:39.043 --> 39:42.377
I tried to understand it,
but I never really could.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.580
He would sit me down
and try to teach me, but

39:44.799 --> 39:46.790
I just wanted to love
him and take him outside

39:47.010 --> 39:48.842
and enjoy and play
with all this.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.545
And you did too,
and he loved it.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.472
You made him the luckiest
man on the face of the earth.

39:54.684 --> 39:57.426
He was envied for
his beautiful Katie.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.889
I wish I could have
done all that for him.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.434
And I wish his empire
could have excited me.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.644
Wait a minute, let's
hear what he has to say

40:07.864 --> 40:10.322
about the boring empire.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.024
Well, I'm afraid now you're
going to have to give it

40:12.243 --> 40:13.904
your complete attention.

40:14.537 --> 40:15.823
Tell me.

40:16.039 --> 40:17.655
Well, everybody's
after it, hits and pieces

40:17.874 --> 40:19.330
of it, raiders.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.953
(Scott) Christ, I'm not cold
yet and everybody wants to

40:21.169 --> 40:22.876
gobble me up.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.919
What can I do about it?

40:25.131 --> 40:26.462
Well you're
chairman of the board.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.005
You sit on all the
bits and pieces.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.799
You have to stop them.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.920
But I have no
idea how to do that.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.220
I'll show you.

40:34.474 --> 40:36.636
(Scott) Katie, you have to go
to Hong Kong right away.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.762
(Katie) I think I should go
to Hong Kong right away.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.970
(Winston) I was just going to
say that, Hong Kong.

40:43.650 --> 40:48.144
And don't forget, you be
all the woman that you are.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.438
Boggle their brains.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.237
Okay.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.360
Now don't be
afraid to be a woman.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.821
It's a deadly weapon, so use it.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.952
You used my exact words.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.283
Exact words.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.668
Well I hope I
make you all proud.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.959
It's after you and
after you and after me.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.349
(whispering)

41:24.649 --> 41:27.311
(laughs)

41:31.823 --> 41:33.939
Well, gentlemen, I
hope I was clear and not

41:34.158 --> 41:37.571
too vacant headed, because
from the look of this

41:37.787 --> 41:41.701
room, it isn't woman's work
we're doing here today, is it?

41:42.750 --> 41:45.367
It has been decided
that there is no point

41:45.586 --> 41:47.543
that can be argued.

41:48.172 --> 41:51.290
The point is based
as it is stated.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.420
It's not ambiguous.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.215
There's no room
for any rhetoric.

41:56.431 --> 41:57.466
You must yield.

41:57.682 --> 41:58.592
Must?

41:58.808 --> 42:00.219
Who the fuck are you?

42:00.435 --> 42:01.266
I never saw you before.

42:01.477 --> 42:02.763
Must, who the fuck are you?

42:02.979 --> 42:04.640
I've never even seen you before.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.563
Don't come down
to their level.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.981
Where does that have a
bearing on the point of issue?

42:09.193 --> 42:10.934
Tell him we 're going
back to the Indian ocean

42:11.612 --> 42:15.480
to put away their
knives and go home.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.985
Now I would suggest
you put away your knives.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.821
You haven't got one sharp
enough to carve up a Scott.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.032
The great Scott lives on in me.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.868
And believe me, this city
will be reduced to dust

42:28.087 --> 42:29.919
before you will best me.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.755
Does Tai Pan ring a bell?

42:33.634 --> 42:34.965
This has been interesting.

42:35.178 --> 42:36.714
Tomorrow at 11:00 we will vote

42:36.929 --> 42:39.296
and that will settle it for now.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.344
But be assured, Mrs.
Scott, that in this room there

42:42.560 --> 42:45.268
are knives sharp enough
to cut you to the bone.

42:45.938 --> 42:49.772
And hearts cold enough to
eat yours as hors d'oeuvres.

42:50.151 --> 42:52.017
You bet your sweet
little ass, honey.

42:52.361 --> 42:54.523
You're too
pretty to eat that.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.776
You noticed.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.359
You've got him,
honey. (laughs)

43:02.663 --> 43:06.076
(romantic music)

43:16.302 --> 43:19.590
I'm sorry I'm so
shy, I'm embarrassed.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.672
So am I.

43:29.690 --> 43:31.226
The tango!

43:32.235 --> 43:33.145
(laughter)

43:35.238 --> 43:38.651
When you say dance, you
mean dance with a capital D.

43:38.866 --> 43:40.482
I love it!

43:40.701 --> 43:42.783
I can see that,
but seriously, Win,

43:42.995 --> 43:44.952
Scott and I never danced a step.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.154
He hated it.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.081
You can't hate it.

43:48.292 --> 43:51.785
No, I love it, but I
don't think I could really

43:52.004 --> 43:53.119
dance with someone.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.922
It was so long ago when
I was just a little girl.

43:56.425 --> 43:57.915
It'll all come back to you.

43:58.469 --> 43:59.880
Come on.

44:00.096 --> 44:01.086
How can it come back to me?

44:01.305 --> 44:03.091
I've never done this before.

44:03.599 --> 44:05.510
Well, you're
going to love it.

44:06.102 --> 44:09.595
(romantic music)

45:16.964 --> 45:19.331
(laughter)

45:21.177 --> 45:23.760
All right, so
you don't love it.

45:23.971 --> 45:26.133
I'm sorry, Win.

45:29.477 --> 45:32.469
I've just never been
with another man before.

45:34.482 --> 45:37.144
Not even to dance with.

45:40.613 --> 45:42.445
I understand.

45:42.657 --> 45:45.524
Someday, maybe not
now, but someday,

45:45.743 --> 45:47.529
you're going to have to, Kate.

45:49.205 --> 45:51.196
Son of a bitch.

45:56.045 --> 45:58.503
Would you like
to go for a swim?

45:58.714 --> 46:00.955
I have been swimming
with men before.

46:01.217 --> 46:03.208
Are there any other choices?

46:03.427 --> 46:04.462
No.

46:04.679 --> 46:05.965
No.

46:06.180 --> 46:07.011
Let's swim.

46:07.223 --> 46:09.339
The pool should be
empty at this time.

46:10.726 --> 46:13.639
No, no actually I shouldn't
be swimming or dancing.

46:13.854 --> 46:17.392
That's right, he can't,
he can't swim or dance.

46:18.401 --> 46:19.891
(Winston) There are a lot
of calls to be made

46:20.111 --> 46:21.727
about tomorrow's vote.

46:21.946 --> 46:23.687
Well I'll help you.

46:24.824 --> 46:27.316
No, no you go
on with your swim

46:27.535 --> 46:30.243
and afterward we'll
talk strategy.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.655
You sure?

46:34.750 --> 46:35.785
Yeah.

46:36.711 --> 46:39.294
Yeah, I'm sure.

46:47.221 --> 46:50.134
(splashing)

46:55.271 --> 46:57.308
How long you
going to stay in?

46:58.566 --> 47:00.477
Should I get out?

47:01.193 --> 47:02.604
No, no, no.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.356
You stay in.

47:08.284 --> 47:10.400
I'm going to see some
of my old buddies.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.407
Katie, are you all right?

47:14.040 --> 47:16.247
I don't think I am all right.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.790
You're doing fine, honey.

47:22.006 --> 47:24.338
No, Scott and Kate.

47:24.550 --> 47:26.382
It was like what worked.

47:27.803 --> 47:29.885
It's not all right
with just Kate.

47:30.598 --> 47:33.465
It's still Scott and Kate!

47:34.393 --> 47:36.054
It always will be.

47:38.898 --> 47:40.434
Will you kiss me?

47:42.568 --> 47:44.104
Honey, you won't
hear bells ring.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.606
They haven't stopped
ringing since the first

47:45.821 --> 47:47.903
time you kissed me.

47:50.117 --> 47:52.484
Did I make bells ring for you?

47:54.121 --> 47:55.532
Oh honey,

47:57.708 --> 48:01.622
you made life ring for me.

48:17.853 --> 48:20.311
Broad's a fucking fruitcake.

48:22.441 --> 48:24.432
Yeah, right.

48:25.528 --> 48:26.814
We can count on you then?

48:27.029 --> 48:29.396
(door opens)
Put the fucking phone down.

48:42.086 --> 48:43.292
(screams)

48:43.504 --> 48:45.871
Oh my god, oh my god.

48:46.090 --> 48:49.128
I'm sorry, but you
scared me to death.

48:50.010 --> 48:51.375
This is the ladies locker room.

48:51.595 --> 48:53.882
The mens is down the hall.

48:58.811 --> 49:01.052
You're not lost, are you?

49:04.775 --> 49:06.732
You're right where
you want to be.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.441
And I'm in trouble.

49:12.533 --> 49:15.195
I won't hurt you
unless you make me.

49:16.036 --> 49:18.403
Why would I want
to make you hurt me?

49:18.622 --> 49:20.408
Yeah, why would you?

49:20.624 --> 49:24.333
Just don't scream again,
do exactly as I tell you,

49:24.879 --> 49:28.588
and you might come
out okay. (laughs)

49:30.885 --> 49:34.094
No, no, I can't
let you rape me.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.756
Oh no.

49:38.350 --> 49:39.932
Oh.

49:43.063 --> 49:44.394
(laughs)

49:44.607 --> 49:45.938
Hi there.

49:49.862 --> 49:52.274
What makes you think
I want to rape you?

49:52.781 --> 49:55.193
Because there are a lot
of rapists in the world.

49:55.409 --> 49:56.774
Yeah, yeah, there are a lot.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.826
Lot of killings too.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.738
Yes there are, but
there are more rapes.

50:01.957 --> 50:03.493
All right, whatever.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.620
Look, I don't want
to argue with you.

50:05.836 --> 50:07.622
You probably know
more than me anyway.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.795
I know you didn't
come here to kill me.

50:10.007 --> 50:13.045
You said, you said, and
this is almost exactly what

50:13.260 --> 50:14.842
you said...

50:18.390 --> 50:22.554
...if you don't
scream and if you do

50:22.770 --> 50:25.888
as you're told,
you won't get hurt.

50:26.148 --> 50:27.684
(laughs)

50:27.900 --> 50:29.436
Now that's not murder.

50:29.652 --> 50:31.484
(laughs)

50:31.695 --> 50:33.902
No, you came here to rape me.

50:34.240 --> 50:38.029
Oh, you want to
get raped? (laughs)

50:39.078 --> 50:42.321
Yes, every day if my
other choice is killed.

50:43.541 --> 50:44.872
(gunshot)

50:48.087 --> 50:50.169
I want you to be good,
so very, very good.

50:50.381 --> 50:53.248
(Scott) I could hear you
scream clear across town.

50:53.467 --> 50:57.005
Oh Scott, you
came just in time.

50:57.555 --> 51:01.298
For God's sake,
you're bare ass naked.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.927
Well I'm sorry, but I
was running for my life.

51:06.146 --> 51:08.308
Who's the seedy
looking bastard?

51:08.524 --> 51:10.936
Well he wants to
rape me, or kill.

51:11.151 --> 51:13.392
I don't really know
what he wants, Scott.

51:13.612 --> 51:14.693
What do you want?

51:14.905 --> 51:19.820
All I want you to do is
to take two little pills.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.827
It's so simple.

51:24.373 --> 51:26.785
I'm not going
to take any pills.

51:27.001 --> 51:28.537
Of course you're not.

51:28.752 --> 51:30.242
You'd never make the meeting.

51:30.462 --> 51:33.454
That's why Chan sent
this goddamn goon here.

51:33.674 --> 51:36.712
That's why I told
him I wouldn't take any.

51:36.927 --> 51:39.214
But how am I not going
to take any pills?

51:39.430 --> 51:42.013
Katie, if you were only a man

51:42.224 --> 51:45.057
and these were
the good old days.

51:45.269 --> 51:46.851
Oh god, I'd pow!

51:47.062 --> 51:49.975
But I'm not a man and
these aren't the good old days

51:50.190 --> 51:52.147
and how am I not
going to take them?

51:52.651 --> 51:54.858
You watch me, watch me.

51:55.070 --> 51:56.652
Watch you?

51:56.864 --> 51:58.104
I can hardly see you.

51:58.324 --> 52:01.066
You know, sometimes you're
almost impossible to see.

52:01.285 --> 52:04.949
Pretend to take
them and put them

52:05.956 --> 52:08.493
inside your mouth.

52:08.709 --> 52:10.575
Yes, but that's
a very old trick.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.000
Come on, look at him.

52:12.212 --> 52:13.748
He won't know the difference.

52:13.964 --> 52:15.546
Look at him.

52:16.133 --> 52:19.626
Okay, now you take these
two little pills, you see?

52:19.845 --> 52:20.755
These two little pills.

52:20.971 --> 52:23.508
And then we'll put you
beddy-byes, all right?

52:23.724 --> 52:24.589
Take the pills.

52:24.808 --> 52:25.388
All right.

52:25.601 --> 52:26.716
Come on, take them.

52:26.935 --> 52:29.427
There seems to be no way
to avoid these pretty pills.

52:32.399 --> 52:33.855
So here they go.

52:35.819 --> 52:38.277
All right, swallow
the fucking pills

52:38.489 --> 52:40.776
or I'm going to give it to
you like the suppository!

52:40.991 --> 52:42.322
Katie, don't!

52:44.662 --> 52:47.370
Or I'll give it to
you like a suppository.

52:49.375 --> 52:52.743
Honey, you've got
to fight the pills.

52:53.462 --> 52:54.793
Yes.

52:55.464 --> 52:57.375
Will you help me?

52:58.926 --> 53:00.667
I can't hold you up.

53:01.470 --> 53:03.302
You're on your own.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.889
Of course.

53:08.977 --> 53:10.217
I'm sorry.

53:10.437 --> 53:12.849
Get some clothes and
let's get out of here.

53:15.067 --> 53:17.604
Now, I've been down the
shaft and it's perfect.

53:17.820 --> 53:20.983
All you've got to do is take
a deep breath and think.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.322
- I can't.
- Think!

53:23.534 --> 53:25.024
I'm awake.

53:25.244 --> 53:26.530
I'm awake.

53:28.122 --> 53:30.409
But I'm not really.

53:30.624 --> 53:33.286
That's bullshit,
Katie, and you know it!

53:33.502 --> 53:36.995
All you gotta do is
think, I'm awake!

53:37.673 --> 53:39.084
Come on, I'm awake.

53:39.299 --> 53:41.131
I hope I can do it right.

53:41.343 --> 53:43.550
Katie, you can
if you want to.

53:44.430 --> 53:47.172
God, it's that simple.

53:47.391 --> 53:50.554
I know, that's
what you always said.

53:54.148 --> 53:56.105
So where's our new body?

53:56.859 --> 53:58.816
That is not...

53:59.820 --> 54:01.857
That is not that simple.

54:04.950 --> 54:09.865
(laughs) Well, we
busted their balls.

54:10.581 --> 54:11.946
Did I win?

54:12.166 --> 54:13.702
I did, didn't I?

54:13.917 --> 54:15.407
You were good.

54:15.627 --> 54:17.368
I read your book.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.044
And I won, I did.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.587
I beat you.

54:20.966 --> 54:22.548
You were very good.

54:22.760 --> 54:25.218
You played the
situation perfectly.

54:25.429 --> 54:27.887
So I beat the
situation, but not you.

54:28.724 --> 54:30.340
That's what you did.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.809
I think you like
to make mischief.

54:34.354 --> 54:35.936
You noticed that too.

54:41.361 --> 54:42.772
Winston!

54:47.451 --> 54:48.191
Kate!

54:48.410 --> 54:49.445
Hey, Winston.

54:49.661 --> 54:51.698
Kate, I'm sorry!

54:51.914 --> 54:53.825
I was late, I missed it.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.748
No, it's all right.

54:55.959 --> 54:57.666
We beat him, Scott said
we busted their balls.

54:57.878 --> 55:00.210
You won and Scott said?

55:00.798 --> 55:02.789
The pirates retreated.

55:03.550 --> 55:05.211
Hey, wait a second.

55:05.427 --> 55:08.636
You single handedly beat
that room full of sharks?

55:08.847 --> 55:11.965
Yes, but I had good coaching.

55:12.184 --> 55:16.974
Well, it really wasn't
one of my best clays. (laughs)

55:17.689 --> 55:19.521
No, I might have
told you a thing or two,

55:19.733 --> 55:21.315
but not enough to win the day.

55:21.527 --> 55:23.518
No Win, you told
me marvelous things.

55:24.071 --> 55:25.812
But Scott also helped me.

55:26.031 --> 55:28.363
He told me exactly what to say.

55:28.575 --> 55:31.613
You know, baby, he
thinks you're cuckoo.

55:32.746 --> 55:35.329
Oh Win, I'm not
losing my marbles.

55:35.541 --> 55:38.408
Don't worry, if you do
I'll pick them up for you.

55:38.627 --> 55:40.584
Now she doesn't need
you to pick them up.

55:41.088 --> 55:42.578
I'm going to go home
now to the islands.

55:42.798 --> 55:44.084
Oh, I'll see you
get there safely.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.085
No you don't,
I take her there.

55:46.301 --> 55:49.885
Well that's sweet, but
it's not just across town.

55:50.556 --> 55:52.046
Kate.

55:52.891 --> 55:56.054
I've always loved you, I'm
sure you've known that.

55:57.855 --> 55:59.596
Just being around you
for a while would be

55:59.815 --> 56:01.726
like Christmas for me.

56:01.942 --> 56:03.182
Don't say no.

56:03.402 --> 56:06.565
(Scott) You say no, loud and clear.

56:08.824 --> 56:10.656
You love me?

56:14.204 --> 56:15.945
I never knew.

56:16.331 --> 56:20.245
Well, your Scott always
was a blinding light.

56:20.878 --> 56:24.291
Well, that's very
nice of you, Win.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.376
Are you packed?

56:26.592 --> 56:28.549
Am I packed?

56:29.469 --> 56:30.834
Five minutes.

56:40.981 --> 56:42.892
Earlier you mentioned love, Win.

56:43.108 --> 56:45.349
You can't talk love to him.

56:45.569 --> 56:48.061
Love is a big word.

56:49.781 --> 56:52.068
Love is our word.

56:53.118 --> 56:58.033
I've loved you for
as long as he has.

57:00.083 --> 57:01.198
Will you stop this
talk, both of you?

57:01.418 --> 57:02.874
Oh, you stop it.

57:03.086 --> 57:05.043
I'm sorry, Win, not you.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.713
But he's here in
the plane with us.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.800
And he thinks love is our word.

57:13.430 --> 57:17.298
Well, it is, it
always has been.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.724
You see, even he knows it.

57:19.937 --> 57:23.646
Katie, I can't stand this
kind of talk from you.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.643
Well you could sit out
on the wing for a minute

57:25.859 --> 57:26.769
and then you wouldn't hear.

57:26.985 --> 57:29.317
I'll go out
and try to behave.

57:30.906 --> 57:34.274
Why did God make you so young?

57:34.493 --> 57:35.733
Because you probably
wouldn't have accepted

57:35.953 --> 57:37.694
me any other way.

57:37.913 --> 57:39.620
Just be careful.

57:39.831 --> 57:41.538
You've got a...

57:42.376 --> 57:45.494
We've got a good thing going.

57:47.673 --> 57:49.789
Don't let go of it yet.

57:53.804 --> 57:56.171
Are you watching my
marbles fall out, Win?

57:56.556 --> 58:00.595
Uh-huh, but I'm sure
you've got plenty left.

58:00.811 --> 58:02.848
Oh, I don't
know about plenty.

58:03.313 --> 58:06.522
(upbeat music)

58:09.319 --> 58:10.605
(Scott) Are we all right?

58:10.821 --> 58:13.779
Are we still history's
greatest lovers?

58:13.991 --> 58:16.904
The way you put
it, we're hanging in.

58:17.119 --> 58:17.859
I'm sorry, Win.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.785
Our friendly ghost is back.

58:19.997 --> 58:20.862
I heard.

58:21.039 --> 58:22.200
You heard him?

58:22.416 --> 58:24.032
No, I heard you!

58:24.251 --> 58:25.707
Ch, of course me.

58:26.086 --> 58:29.204
See, if I waited to talk
to him only when no one

58:29.423 --> 58:31.915
was listening, I'd go
crazy because he's always

58:32.134 --> 58:33.795
talking to me.

58:34.011 --> 58:35.797
(Scott) I feel like you're a
kite that's about to catch

58:36.013 --> 58:39.426
a strong gust of wind and
be torn from me forever.

58:39.641 --> 58:41.552
I won't be that kite.

58:42.853 --> 58:46.141
You've turned
away the wolves.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.602
You're an amazing young lady.

58:48.817 --> 58:50.399
Thank you, Win.

58:53.613 --> 58:55.069
Come on, let's dance.

58:55.282 --> 58:57.023
No, Win, I can't.

58:57.242 --> 58:58.482
Ah, come on.

58:58.702 --> 58:59.658
No, Win, you know I can't.

58:59.870 --> 59:00.530
Please.

59:00.746 --> 59:02.328
I'm sorry.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.833
Well you're fantastic.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.752
You like that kind of stuff?

59:09.963 --> 59:12.796
Well yes, Scott, a
little bit sometimes.

59:14.593 --> 59:17.176
Come on, dance with me.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.466
Really?

59:19.681 --> 59:21.467
Really.

59:22.059 --> 59:25.552
(upbeat music)

59:30.734 --> 59:32.816
What are you doing?

59:34.488 --> 59:37.071
Well I think
I'm dancing, Scott.

59:39.993 --> 59:43.156
Babe, where'd you learn that?

59:44.289 --> 59:46.530
In the kitchen
or the bathroom or

59:46.750 --> 59:48.741
wherever it wouldn't bother you.

59:49.669 --> 59:52.912
(upbeat music)

59:57.969 --> 01:00:00.210
(Winston) You said you didn't dance?!

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.717
I don't, I never have!

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.889
Not with a person.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.139
(laughs)

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:11.931
When I return, we're
going to do this a lot.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:14.399
I'll have new legs then.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:18.566
(upbeat music)

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:41.043
Ooh, we're better
than any of them.

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:45.176
Even that kid with
the one glove.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.315
Ooh, Katie!

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:59.396
(upbeat music)

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.757
She making you
lose it, Minister?

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.048
Hear you talking to yourself.

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:35.643
My god, what we've missed.

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.941
(laughter)

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.876
Stop that!

01:01:56.796 --> 01:02:00.505
In God's name, I
command you to stop!

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:03.671
The devil is in you!

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:06.837
(laughs)

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.718
What are you doing, reverend?

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:10.299
Have you gone crazy?

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.725
She is desecrating
the Sabbath!

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.645
It's Friday.

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.972
Did you see her dance?

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:19.854
Yes, it was like a mission.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.653
And then you came and
stopped the music, reverend.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:25.231
Turn the music on, please.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:26.235
No.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:28.658
Yes, I want to see her dance.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.986
No, God says no!

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:33.117
No, it's all right, reverend.

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:35.457
It's all right.

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:38.582
Your she devil won't
dance any more tonight.

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:39.832
Yes!

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.376
Praise God!

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.175
Hold me and I will take
the devil from your body.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:48.675
Praise God, I can
feel it happening.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.301
(laughs)

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:52.967
Thank you, reverend.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.854
It's over, he's gone.

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:00.728
Thank you.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:02.059
It's over.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:03.735
I'm at peace now.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.359
Yes, yes.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.024
I could feel him enter my body.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:10.405
Yes.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:14.780
God will deal with him now.

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:17.912
(laughs)

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:24.082
Kate, if you want
to dance, dance.

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:27.839
Of course, it's
not even Sunday.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.215
Come on, honey.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:33.265
Ask him to play some slow dance.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:36.100
May we have slow music now?

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:39.809
That loud thing over there
does not make slow music.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:43.563
But I'll make it for
you, yes, I will.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:46.903
(laughs)

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:50.525
(slow piano music)

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:54.536
(Winston) Kate.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:03.499
Kate.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.923
What are you doing?

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.468
Scott just wanted
to slow dance.

01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:12.929
It's our first time.

01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:14.347
I love it.

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:18.894
Are you having a good time?

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:21.563
(Scott) The time of my life.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:26.353
(slow music)

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:16.910
(Scott) Katie.

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:18.077
Katie.

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.155
I want a decision now.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:21.706
But I can't kill him.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:24.539
You know I hate to
even swat a fly.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.085
Nobody's going
to come forward and

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:28.208
donate his body.

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:31.083
He's with us
again now, isn't he?

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.254
Yes, Win.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.510
Katie, you know,
after all the research,

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:42.265
I've found rat poison is
the simplest. (laughs)

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.309
He certainly
gave you paradise.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:48.563
I can't stand to see a
man slump like a sack of shit

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.733
on a horse or an elephant.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:55.782
Can you imagine rat
poison? (laughs)

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:59.240
No, of course she didn't
invent the black pearl.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.447
But who cared about it before?

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:02.576
Nobody.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.204
Now she's turned it into
something real special.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.208
But did she have to dive
for them with nothing on.

01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:10.630
They say she's stark ass naked.

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:12.298
Well that's no big deal.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:14.547
So she's wild and crazy.

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:20.682
And that great surgeon,
what's his name?

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:21.725
You know the one.

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:22.641
What, the breasts too?

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.561
Absolutely breasts.

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:26.228
Darling, who in the
world but you and me

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:27.977
haven't done their breasts?

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.775
Well that's true.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.288
Hello!

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:52.998
I'm Kate Scott.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:56.461
Thank you for coming so
far to see my pearls.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:59.304
(Scott) Remember how I
could hit the ball?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:00.426
Ha, got you.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:01.347
No, no.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:03.846
(Scott) Come on now,
dig in and get it.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.933
All right,
watch this one now.

01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:10.899
(Scott) Katie, you were
great and will be again.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.942
I'm only living
for that moment.

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:14.770
For what moment?

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:18.364
Oh, I was just
talking with my ghost.

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:19.691
Your husband?

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:21.151
Mm-hmm.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.611
It happens like
that with great loves.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.366
You know, neither
can let the other go.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:26.698
Hey, she's not only good
looking, she's no dummy.

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:30.377
Ask her if she knows
anything about possession.

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.670
He wants to know
if you know anything

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.338
about possession.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.883
(yelling)

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:40.754
Is he looking for a body?

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.510
You know about it?

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.307
I'm a white witch.

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:46.305
A white witch?

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.521
Well can you see him?

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:51.352
(laughs)

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:55.981
No.

01:07:57.949 --> 01:08:00.190
But I think I can feel him.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.701
Hi, I'm Fausto Girabaldi.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.703
Sabine Justin.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:12.411
I think Fausto and Sabine
should dance sometime.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:15.588
No, there is an obvious
reason why this won't happen.

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:18.545
I have absolutely no
desire to dance with you.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.296
Oh, you'll watch me
and you'll scream in your

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.880
dreams, Fausto, I love you.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.591
And I'll forgive you, Sabine.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.393
Oh no, no, no!

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:32.854
We win!

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:34.148
(cheering)

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.692
You hustle real
good, Miss Scott.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.983
You can stay and
play in the game.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.609
What?

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.819
Well, that should be
a body worth considering.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.617
That's the one he picked.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:51.874
He liked the hair and the
teeth and the rest, I guess.

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.077
(laughs)

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.250
Well how do
you feel about it?

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.296
I don't know.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:08:59.545
You do realize you
can only occupy a body

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.752
at the actual moment of death.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:04.962
I guess so.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:07.390
But how's this
death going to happen?

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:08.636
Rat poison.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:10.469
Rat poison.

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:11.974
Rat poison?

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.522
Excuse me, but I do
have some shopping to do.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.765
Okay, I'll see you later.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.522
Katie, that should
be easy for you.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.854
He's absolutely worthless.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:24.194
He's full of vanity,
nothing more.

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:27.786
Scott, I need to think
about this all by myself.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:31.911
The outsider,
that is what we need.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:35.162
(laughs)

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:39.965
You could have such
fun with that body.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.130
Oh, shut up, Scott!

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.006
Shut up?

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:49.140
Katie, shut up?

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.511
No, I didn't say that.

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:58.646
I said I have to think
about this all by myself.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.441
Okay.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.155
Fair enough.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:07.655
You want it, you got it.

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:12.614
I love you.

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.618
You should, Katie.

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:19.626
When you're over here,
looking back, you know.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:22.629
You know what love is.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:25.586
It's what we always said it was.

01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:29.180
It's everything.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:32.092
Only it takes two.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.180
Well I'm going to think
about this now, Scott.

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:39.228
But all by myself.

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:42.736
Did you dance
with Katie like this?

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:50.493
I can never dance
with Katie like this.

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:59.581
Maybe it is a
difficult thing.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:03.214
But that Mickey Mouse contraption

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.758
she has invented got it.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:08.553
It's quite cunning, I feel.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:10.092
(laughter)

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:11.764
I'm awfully greedy.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:14.058
I want the whole thing.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:21.978
You are a killer.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.066
I think I'm going to
go see the widow Scott.

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:30.568
I mix a little drink
of rat poison and papaya.

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:39.910
And then I hand it to him.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.129
I smile...

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:46.916
...and his dirty
eyes smile back.

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:51.258
And he drinks it all down.

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:54.303
But then he looks at me
in disbelief as it dawns

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.430
on him that I poisoned him.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.971
He staggers back, falling.

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:02.812
Struggling, in horrible pain.

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:05.394
And then he dies.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:09.068
But then the great one
slips into his body.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:14.365
And he's up like a shot,
eyes twinkling and bright.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.163
Then he sweeps me into his arms

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:20.208
and then he carries me to bed.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.627
And looks deep into my eyes.

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:30.335
And says, "Don't
be afraid, Katie."

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:31.628
"I'm not..."

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:32.679
Fausto.

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:33.721
Oh!

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.674
Fausto, Mrs. Scott.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:37.846
Doing your poetry again?

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:41.771
Yes, don't go in the light.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.057
Why, Will the bells ring?

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:47.019
(sirens)

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:49.320
That's Scott's house.

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:51.114
That sounds bad.

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:52.656
This the O'Dare?

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:54.697
Hard to believe this
is really the largest

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.870
black pearl in the whole world.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:00.248
Of course it's the largest.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:03.831
You're a bastard, Fausto,
a selfish, rotten bastard!

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.081
(Scott) Get a gun.

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:06.538
Get a gun!

01:13:06.757 --> 01:13:08.498
This punk's up to no good.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.208
All right, get out.

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:11.042
(laughs)

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:15.176
No, like you said, I'm
a selfish, rotten bastard.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.223
Get a gun, get a gun!

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:18.721
Yes, yes I will.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.347
I'll get a gun.

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:23.017
More of your
poetry, Mrs. Scott?

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:27.608
Hold on tight now!

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:29.610
(laughs)

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:30.653
Good girl.

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:33.152
A look at that should
make him go limp.

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.950
All right, out of
here now, damn it.

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:39.742
Do you really think a
gorgeous thing like you

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:42.949
could shoot a gorgeous
thing like me?

01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:47.787
Fausto!

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:49.543
What, Mrs. Scott?

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:50.840
Shoot!

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.793
But I can't shoot!

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:54.548
Why, Mrs. Scott?

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.926
Move the gun a little
over to the right.

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:59.052
Put it on his heart!

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:00.925
I can't.

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:02.969
Squeeze the trigger.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:06.398
And in one second we
could be together forever.

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:08.020
I know.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:11.444
Oh, oh no.

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:13.362
Oh my god.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.910
My god, it was all there.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.572
I know, and I want it so bad.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.828
Well you don't
have to want anymore.

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:26.535
This selfish bastard will
give you what you want.

01:14:26.754 --> 01:14:27.835
And much more.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:28.957
No!

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:30.413
(Scott) God, you're sloppy.

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:31.873
You're better than that.

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:33.675
This isn't make believe!

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.376
He's not my instructor!

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:36.882
Put an end to it!

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:38.805
That was a really
good try, real good.

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:40.848
Fausto, go home!

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.425
I hope you're
as much fun in bed

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.306
as you are getting you there.

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:46.354
You should have shot him.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.932
If you don't shut
up I'll shoot you.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.937
We've already
been through that.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:54.191
Am I hearing shut up again?

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:56.648
Yes, shut up
and let me fight!

01:14:56.867 --> 01:14:58.653
All right, get him!

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.820
We're out of gas!

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:05.907
Hit him with a club.

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:07.959
Grab the club and hit him.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:10.829
Okay.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.039
Are you going to use that
club like you use the gun?

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:17.256
Hit him, now!

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:18.711
Katie, now!

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:19.887
I can't!

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.055
Yes you can!

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.133
I can't!

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.181
This is perfect.

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:26.511
Now get the poison.

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:27.937
Stop!

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:29.731
Come on.
Stop!

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:32.066
Where is it?

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.066
There.

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.200
Oh.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:44.862
Pull his lips
open and pour it in.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:49.831
Yes, his lips,
I know, open them.

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:54.710
Pull his lips
open and pour it in.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:59.719
Oh, okay, okay, no problem.

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:03.924
Yes, God, then God, do it!

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:12.432
Oh, I can't.

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.767
Goddamnit, son of a bitch!

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.691
I'm sorry.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:20.194
I don't need sorry.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:23.276
I need, I need that body.

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:26.120
And I want you to have it.

01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:30.208
If you love me greatly
and I mean greatly,

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:34.003
as you always claimed,
that boy lying there

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:35.046
would be me.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.919
Now unless the little son
of a bitch commits suicide,

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:41.298
as you kids say,
I am out of here.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.217
No!

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.015
I am history!

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:51.016
No!

01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:56.522
(cries)

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:02.945
Kate?

01:17:04.703 --> 01:17:06.364
Katie, what happened?

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:10.289
Kate, is he dead?

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:11.582
No.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.626
But he should be.

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:16.000
He will be, Scott!

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:18.790
Kate?

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.925
Oh, Winston.

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.386
Are you all right?

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:27.799
Katie, is he here?

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:28.849
Who?

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.893
Your husband.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.307
I hurt him and he left.

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.183
He's dead.

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:39.440
I'm sure he must be dead.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.278
No, no, he's not dead.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.527
I can feel his
heartbeat very strongly.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.983
Are you all right?

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:48.240
I'm trying to be, Winston.

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:51.413
What ever happened here?

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:54.368
Well, I hit him with a club.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.123
But not hard enough.

01:17:57.882 --> 01:17:59.919
Why'd you have to hit him?

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:04.928
Well, he attacked me
and we fought, and...

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:08.055
Oh, what a bad boy he is.

01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:12.102
I'm arresting him now and
putting him behind bars,

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:15.806
and then I will find some
suitable punishment for him.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:19.893
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.609
You did very well to subdue him.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.031
Very well indeed.

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:28.450
I hit him with the war club,

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:30.244
but my eyes were
closed or I would have

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:32.367
done it much better.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.790
(laughs) Better
would have killed him.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:37.460
Oh yes, I'm
sure it would have.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:40.003
All right, everybody,
come on, let's go!

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.923
Everything's under control here.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:43.465
Just go back to the party
and have a good time.

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:45.133
There's nothing
more to see here.

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:46.677
Just go back to the party.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:48.721
Are you sure, Mrs.
Scott, that you'll...

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:50.765
She almost killed me.

01:18:51.018 --> 01:18:52.133
I should have.

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:54.720
I'll regret the rest of
my life that I didn't!

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:55.974
Winston, get him out of here.

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.646
We'll see you in a while.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:58.848
Kate?

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.225
I'll be okay.

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.491
He's really gone.

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:10.284
But why?

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:17.325
Have I gone crazy?

01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:19.205
I'm sure under
the circumstances,

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:22.413
for a moment anybody would.

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:27.756
No, because if I were
crazy, I would have been

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.839
talking to myself and I wasn't.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.091
So I'm not!

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:38.638
But that means the dirty
son of a bitch has left me.

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.028
Katie, why
should he leave you?

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.234
Because I
couldn't kill Fausto.

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:52.864
Oh, I wish I had!

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:56.281
All right, now
listen, Katie, you didn't

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.834
and he's gone, but somehow
you have got to live on.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:03.621
He has my heart.

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:06.499
How can I live without a heart?

01:20:06.927 --> 01:20:09.510
Most people do
it quite easily.

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:12.885
I'll die.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:17.636
Is there no way
I can talk to God,

01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:19.687
man to man, directly?

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:21.852
Mm-mm.

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:25.563
Could Katie?

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:27.862
She could try.

01:20:29.783 --> 01:20:32.366
It's a very busy line.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.403
I can imagine.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.244
Well.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:46.168
I have to tell you
something important.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.468
You have one foot in hell.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.590
And if you continue
to incite violence,

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:55.423
you just may end up in
that big bad red pit.

01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:00.682
Listen, tell me,

01:21:00.898 --> 01:21:04.482
how do I get life back?

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:07.230
You can't.

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:11.613
Come on, of course you can.

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:15.201
You can possess a body.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:19.121
What I'm trying
to tell you is

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.914
people are afraid to
death to die, right?

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:27.751
First thing they do is to
try to get back down there.

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:32.297
Either through
reincarnation or possession.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.629
But you can't do that.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:36.885
Those are fairy tales.

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.557
I have to get back.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:40.726
Eternity without her is,

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:44.514
it's... it's impossible.

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.271
In our world there
are no shortcuts.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:50.728
There's no way out of eternity.

01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:52.939
You're stuck with it.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:55.692
Kate, want to show
them what you've done.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.697
Okay, Win.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.583
(applause)

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.210
You got their attention.

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:19.303
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm so, so sorry.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:20.883
Forgive me, I'll kill him!

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:22.643
I knew you would.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.971
Don't forget about
the boogeyman pit.

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:27.894
At least give her a choice.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:35.944
Katie, it could
doom you to hell.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.446
Would we be together?

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:38.867
(Scott) Yes, yes.

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.243
(Katie) Then let's do it now.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.868
Let's try it, let's see.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:47.835
It could mean hell forever.

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:50.125
(Katie) Do you want to go for it?

01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:51.997
(Scott) It might not work.

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:53.628
Can you hear what I'm saying?

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:56.506
Loud and clear,
are we going for it?

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.339
Like I always
say, thrice warned.

01:22:59.558 --> 01:23:01.140
What more can you do?

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:05.345
It's up to you, babe.

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:07.054
We're going for it!

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:10.145
Kate!

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:14.904
Where are you going?!

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:16.989
I'm going with you!

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.404
Okay, okay.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:21.945
Finally.

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:24.822
You're going to get him.

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:27.074
Hold on!

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:28.375
What is she doing?

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:29.577
Kate, wait!

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:30.752
I'm sorry, Win, I'm
going to go get him!

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:32.079
Wait!

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.008
Katie, you're
going to get him.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.927
Oh God.

01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:40.008
Kate!

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.136
Is she all right?

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.851
She's with Scott.

01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:47.098
You believe that?

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.350
No, but she does.

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:52.274
Well I do too, but
shouldn't we go after her?

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.227
There's nothing here
that can catch her.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:55.857
Katie!

01:23:56.073 --> 01:23:57.859
Take care!

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:02.489
Where is he?

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.786
He's not here, he's
supposed to be here.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.202
Where's Garibaldi?

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:08.373
He and the mayor
took a boat last night

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:10.417
and went somewhere, I guess.

01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:13.078
Why is he with the mayor?

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:16.924
I've got to get
back to the island.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:19.172
I bet Fausto's there.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:20.378
(Scott) You can't take the boat.

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:22.087
It'll take too goddamn long.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:24.469
You'll never get
through the reefs.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:26.934
Then I won't take the boat.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:56.998
(spoken in drunk voice)
I will fill your brazier cup

01:24:57.259 --> 01:24:59.921
with pearls for you every

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:02.504
year if you will be my

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:05.966
very beautiful wife.

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.806
But I don't wear a brazier.

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:11.262
You don't.

01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:15.850
But you see already how
much you have saved for me.

01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:18.561
(horn honking)

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:30.956
I have to talk to you!

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:32.958
Alone!

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:34.960
Mrs. Scott.

01:25:35.172 --> 01:25:38.085
Now, your honor, immediately!

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:39.464
Get him, Kate.

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.166
You're damn right!

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:44.299
You're damn right, of
course, immediately Mrs. Scott.

01:25:44.514 --> 01:25:46.721
Where is Garibaldi?

01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:48.719
He's in our fine jail.

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:50.596
No he is not.

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:51.677
He escaped?

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.980
Oh, Mrs. Scott, I wish
we had a devil's island

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:57.354
for this bad boy.

01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:59.526
He escaped with you.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:01.524
Me, with me?

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.276
What are you saying, Mrs. Scott?

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:05.608
I am saying that
you left the jail with

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:09.616
Garibaldi and took
a boat to where?

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.826
We took a boat?

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:13.407
Yes, we took a boat!

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:15.751
That's it, Katie,
grind him, grind him.

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:18.499
I'm going to ask
you one more time.

01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:21.081
And then I'm going
to beat you up.

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:22.336
Oh, beat me up?

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:24.668
Yes, beat you up badly.

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:25.844
Yes, of course.

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:27.763
You will and I think you should.

01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:30.136
Yes, we did take a boat.

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:33.765
Now, I must remember where
we went in this boat.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.891
I'm going to count to three.

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:38.850
Yes, of course, but slowly.

01:26:39.069 --> 01:26:39.854
Slowly, please.

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:41.777
There's a strange
diver in the pearl bed.

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:44.070
There's a strange
diver in the pearl bed.

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:46.398
That's where Garibaldi is.

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:49.201
I'm going to go kill him
and then I'm going to

01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:53.702
come back and break your
body into little pieces!

01:26:55.919 --> 01:26:57.751
They only made
one of you, Kate.

01:26:57.963 --> 01:27:00.000
Only one.

01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:01.713
Wait, wait!

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:06.802
You follow that boat, go on!

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:11.849
Katie, he's fouled up
in the lines down there.

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:14.055
He's already dead!

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:17.847
No, he's not dead yet.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:19.640
He's not!

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.770
Let's see.

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:22.226
(Winston) Kate, here I come!

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.773
Katie, it's no use!

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.730
He's dead!

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:11.616
It's a good try,
but you missed.

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:14.240
Tell your Katie he's gone.

01:28:14.498 --> 01:28:16.660
It's time you came with me.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.081
Bullshit.

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:19.533
She'll get him.

01:28:21.004 --> 01:28:22.586
You just watch.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:30.802
Bring him back.

01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:33.297
Give him to me.

01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:34.427
He's gone, honey.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.475
No, I'll get him.

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:37.847
Kate.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:41.688
Give me that one
precious second.

01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:47.524
Kate!

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.906
He's back.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:53.863
He's breathing.

01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:04.703
You are the most willful!

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:06.876
Katie, you did it!

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:08.753
You did it!

01:29:13.098 --> 01:29:14.759
Oh my God.

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:16.886
Oh my God.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:19.597
Scott?

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.434
Scott, are you in there?

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:26.275
I flew.

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:30.696
Oh, welcome back,
you awesome bastard.

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:35.572
We have come to
witness the marriage

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:38.950
of two people, Kate and Fausto.

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:41.866
And now by virtue of
the powers vested in me

01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:45.077
by the state of Wyoming,
I now pronounce you

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:47.208
husband and wife.

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:49.710
You may kiss the bride.

01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:57.764
You're even more beautiful
than the first time.

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:00.012
So are you.

01:30:06.026 --> 01:30:08.438
(rooster crows)

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:24.499
Oh no, Scott.
Oh no, Scott.

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:27.078
No, no, no, I can't.

01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:29.538
(laughter)

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:33.129
Scott, no more, I give up.

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:42.309
(laughter)

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:45.770
Isn't this fantastic?

01:30:45.982 --> 01:30:48.519
What a wonderful way to die.

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:51.234
Oh no.

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:54.479
Did I lie to you?

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.817
Are we having fun
with this body?

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.907
I told you you'd like him.

01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:05.825
Let's make all the
bells on Earth ring!

01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:07.830
(bells ringing)

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:14.921
Oh no, Scott, oh no.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:17.423
I can't, I can't anymore.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:19.630
It'll kill me, I promise.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:22.181
Prepare to die.

01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:25.135
(laughs)

01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:37.648
Jesus, goddamnit.

01:31:39.995 --> 01:31:42.407
(laughter)

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:46.247
Did you fall off again?

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:51.420
This kid was not
much of an athlete.

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.086
Oh, poor Scott.

01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:58.877
How do I do this?

01:31:59.556 --> 01:32:01.797
(laughs)

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:05.638
Be careful with that rein.

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:09.063
I used to be able to
ride like the fucking wind.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:15.520
Fausto, Fausto.

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:17.813
Scott.

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:27.990
You sure are a good
looking son of a bitch.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:31.334
Always have been. (laughs)

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:37.333
(soft music)
