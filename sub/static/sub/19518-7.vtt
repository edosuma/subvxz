WEBVTT

00:00.007 --> 00:02.547
How did you know there was
someone in your house, Lily?

00:02.555 --> 00:03.843
He left fingernails!

00:03.873 --> 00:05.406
You know something about Sandy's death.

00:05.441 --> 00:07.498
They were talking about
some mess they were in.

00:07.523 --> 00:09.191
I've been prepping
for this mess all day.

00:09.225 --> 00:10.859
Did you destroy evidence?

00:10.893 --> 00:13.228
You let me think that my dad
had an affair with a teenager

00:13.262 --> 00:14.429
and it was you!

00:14.464 --> 00:16.500
He's dead! I'm alive!

00:16.525 --> 00:18.059
The video's taken the night Jesse died.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.351
That means you weren't at home.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.187
That means you can't alibi Tom.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.022
He's finding a temporary situation.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.825
Some desperate girl who'll fall
over herself to be with him.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.194
You don't have to feel
pain to be with someone.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.040
You don't have to drive someone
to the edge of fucking sanity.

00:34.811 --> 00:36.578
Who are you?!

01:31.766 --> 01:34.101
I'm so sorry about last night.

01:36.504 --> 01:38.554
Classic Annie Ryder.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.841
Well, you got into a fight, too.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.309
It's not like you're that evolved.

01:42.343 --> 01:44.344
I'm trying, Annie.

01:44.379 --> 01:45.979
Why is that a win for you?

01:46.014 --> 01:47.448
It's not.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.820
I'm just trying to, to make a change.

01:49.845 --> 01:52.447
And I don't know why you won't let me.

01:59.138 --> 02:00.961
I have a brother.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.697
- I just found out.
- What?

02:03.731 --> 02:05.265
What do you mean you have a brother?

02:05.300 --> 02:07.021
His name's Adam.

02:07.047 --> 02:09.148
He's nine years older than me.

02:11.906 --> 02:14.524
He thinks I'm his only family.

02:14.557 --> 02:16.110
He's pretty messed up.

02:16.144 --> 02:18.539
- Well, how do you know?
- Did, did you see him?

02:18.578 --> 02:20.314
I went to dad's fishing cabin.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.267
Why the fuck did you go there?

02:22.292 --> 02:23.759
He's messed up how?

02:23.784 --> 02:25.776
I don't, I don't know.

02:25.987 --> 02:28.384
I don't have the answers.

02:29.090 --> 02:30.791
Jesus.

02:30.825 --> 02:33.093
I don't think he's my mom's.

02:33.128 --> 02:35.072
My parents were only
together for a couple of years

02:35.097 --> 02:36.463
before they had me.

02:36.488 --> 02:38.291
Is he fucking dangerous?

03:15.789 --> 03:17.233
_

03:20.053 --> 03:22.488
Tom lied. His alibi is bullshit.

03:23.778 --> 03:25.279
You said you didn't pick Jesse up.

03:25.313 --> 03:26.680
But we know you did.

03:26.714 --> 03:28.782
We can place Jesse in the white truck.

03:28.816 --> 03:30.751
We're getting a warrant
to check your phone, GPS,

03:30.785 --> 03:32.186
scrub down your truck.

03:32.220 --> 03:33.854
Your best chance is to
tell us what happened

03:33.888 --> 03:36.156
before the evidence comes back.

03:36.191 --> 03:37.424
My best chance, huh?

03:37.458 --> 03:40.022
Wow, that's great. That's uh...

03:41.572 --> 03:43.233
that's appealing.

03:45.533 --> 03:47.639
Tom, have you been drinking?

03:51.558 --> 03:53.449
If there's an explanation...

03:53.474 --> 03:56.720
that's gonna get you out of
a 25-year-prison sentence,

03:56.760 --> 03:58.236
I'd get into it.

04:01.164 --> 04:03.291
You picked Jesse up...

04:04.697 --> 04:07.164
Yeah. Okay. I picked him up.

04:09.170 --> 04:11.821
But I... I didn't hurt him!

04:12.797 --> 04:14.617
What did you do?

04:15.430 --> 04:18.098
B-Bethany was freaking out
because of the fight at the,

04:18.132 --> 04:19.565
at the scrap yard, you know.

04:19.601 --> 04:21.536
And ah...

04:21.903 --> 04:25.439
Lily asked me to pick Jesse up, and uh,

04:25.473 --> 04:27.441
meet her at the church.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.509
Can anyone confirm this?

04:31.613 --> 04:33.113
Father J.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.436
The mayor, the priest
and the hockey coach

04:48.467 --> 04:50.756
all saw Jesse the night he was killed.

04:50.781 --> 04:52.186
And lied about it.

04:52.638 --> 04:54.201
Bring them in.

04:55.264 --> 04:56.598
Hey.

04:59.374 --> 05:01.573
Are we gonna have a problem here?

05:01.994 --> 05:04.190
Not if you keep it clean.

05:19.661 --> 05:21.531
Hey Ryder,

05:21.748 --> 05:24.149
I'm sitting outside Father J's.

05:24.174 --> 05:26.508
I'll let you know when I have Mother.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.414
You know I, I really hate to do this...

05:40.448 --> 05:44.251
I didn't know anything about
this conversion therapy.

05:44.285 --> 05:45.919
Bethany called me.

05:45.953 --> 05:47.787
- From the scrap yard?
- Yes.

05:47.812 --> 05:49.922
She, Jacob and Max had
apparently been trying

05:49.957 --> 05:51.925
to help Jesse.

05:51.959 --> 05:54.528
It was misguided, obviously.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.730
It was time some adults got involved.

06:07.175 --> 06:08.842
How did you end up at the church?

06:08.876 --> 06:11.645
Jesse called just after the scrap yard.

06:11.679 --> 06:14.614
Mother said to meet her there with him.

06:14.649 --> 06:16.450
Just, just to talk.

06:16.484 --> 06:18.750
And, and what did you
talk to Jesse about?

06:18.887 --> 06:21.157
We were worried about him.

06:21.907 --> 06:24.891
We tried to tell him he
was on the wrong path.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.415
Because you feel that
your path is the only path?

06:29.118 --> 06:31.841
We told Jesse how much the
people of Bellevue loved him.

06:31.866 --> 06:34.935
How they loved Jesse so much,
that they electrocuted her

06:34.969 --> 06:36.770
to get her to reject who she really was?

06:36.804 --> 06:38.739
The world is the world.
If he didn't open his eyes,

06:38.773 --> 06:40.440
this was just gonna
keep happening to him.

06:40.475 --> 06:44.344
We got there around 12:30.
We left just after one.

06:44.379 --> 06:45.917
You sure about that?

06:45.942 --> 06:48.714
Yeah. I heard a bell,
it chimed once for one.

06:48.750 --> 06:52.111
So you talked to Jesse.
Obviously it didn't go well.

06:52.136 --> 06:54.287
Then what? Jesse go back in Tom's truck?

06:54.322 --> 06:56.476
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What?

06:56.501 --> 06:59.092
No! He didn't get back
in my fucking truck.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.890
- What?
- He ran out.

07:00.915 --> 07:04.060
Jesse was seen in a white
truck later that night.

07:04.085 --> 07:05.699
Are you saying that wasn't your truck?

07:05.733 --> 07:09.223
The church was the
last I saw of him, okay?

07:09.248 --> 07:10.703
I swear.

07:10.738 --> 07:12.939
You have to understand that it looks bad

07:12.974 --> 07:14.862
that you didn't tell
us any of this before.

07:14.887 --> 07:17.613
The town needed its
leaders to be strong.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.346
We didn't want Bellevue to know

07:19.371 --> 07:23.316
that we'd failed Jesse
right before he...

07:26.691 --> 07:29.073
He was seen alive after we met.

07:29.098 --> 07:31.722
I absolutely would've come forward,
but it just didn't seem relevant.

07:31.747 --> 07:33.026
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:33.060 --> 07:35.688
Seeing a dead kid on
the night that he died

07:35.713 --> 07:37.628
didn't seem relevant?

07:41.702 --> 07:43.514
Can I have the room?

07:59.827 --> 08:01.499
You know me.

08:02.790 --> 08:05.140
You know everything about me.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.374
Yes, I do.

08:17.271 --> 08:18.783
Hey.

08:19.106 --> 08:22.876
Ah... last night it
was ah... k-kinda crazy.

08:22.910 --> 08:24.211
I'm sorry I ah...

08:24.245 --> 08:26.889
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

08:26.914 --> 08:28.666
He says Jesse ran away.

08:28.691 --> 08:30.058
Yeah. So did Jameson.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.717
At least they got their story straight.

08:31.742 --> 08:33.352
Well, Tom says he
heard a clock chime one,

08:33.386 --> 08:35.222
right before they left.

08:35.256 --> 08:37.957
So they took Jesse
to the church to talk?

08:37.991 --> 08:40.293
Yeah. You can talk anywhere.

09:28.947 --> 09:31.335
_

09:55.369 --> 09:57.270
People watch everything...

09:57.305 --> 09:58.738
You gotta snap out of this.

10:01.421 --> 10:02.844
... Appreciate the courage.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.336
You can ask too much of them...

10:04.361 --> 10:06.711
There'll be consequences
to that beating.

10:06.914 --> 10:09.273
Should never, never have happened.

10:09.584 --> 10:11.318
Someone was at the church,

10:11.352 --> 10:13.180
they saw everything.

10:13.909 --> 10:15.711
The clock that Tom thought he heard

10:15.736 --> 10:17.542
was a door chime.

10:18.783 --> 10:21.284
Someone else was there
the night Jesse was killed.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.475
I talked to Jameson.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.110
He says that door's open in his office

10:37.144 --> 10:38.778
whenever he's working late.

10:38.813 --> 10:41.181
In case anyone needs
solace, day or night.

10:41.215 --> 10:44.084
- So the chime is an alarm?
- More of an alert.

10:44.118 --> 10:45.889
Although he doesn't
even hear it anymore.

10:45.914 --> 10:47.988
Tom's phone GPS came back.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.056
It supports his story.

10:50.091 --> 10:52.025
We checked against cell towers

10:52.059 --> 10:53.426
and shows that he didn't go any further

10:53.461 --> 10:55.295
than the church and his home.

10:55.329 --> 10:57.631
And the lake is no
where along that route.

10:57.878 --> 10:59.529
Can I see that?

11:00.783 --> 11:03.813
So Tom has an alibi for Jesse's death.

11:03.838 --> 11:05.365
Jameson doesn't drive.

11:05.390 --> 11:07.474
And Mother doesn't own a white truck.

11:07.508 --> 11:09.109
So Jesse truly ran off.

11:09.143 --> 11:11.955
But he was still seen in a white
truck later that night by Danny.

11:12.002 --> 11:14.196
Then, I guess we're looking
for a second white truck.

11:14.221 --> 11:15.900
Shit.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.440
All right. Well, let's expand the radius

11:17.465 --> 11:18.680
of the truck search to Sudbury.

11:18.705 --> 11:21.533
Maybe the killer lives further
a field than we thought.

11:21.558 --> 11:25.281
The chime that Tom thought
was a clock was a door opening.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.080
Someone was there.

11:27.684 --> 11:29.127
Someone?

11:30.320 --> 11:32.755
Well, okay... but we have no idea who.

11:32.789 --> 11:35.596
So again, we're nowhere.

11:39.192 --> 11:40.963
Could we put this photo out there.

11:40.997 --> 11:43.052
See if anyone's seen it.

11:45.191 --> 11:46.661
My office.

11:51.032 --> 11:52.863
Shut the door.

11:56.558 --> 11:58.081
What is this?

11:59.616 --> 12:02.503
He looks just like that. My riddler.

12:03.275 --> 12:05.943
His name's Adam and I'm
pretty sure he's my brother.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.592
What?

12:09.626 --> 12:11.675
You didn't know anything?

12:12.542 --> 12:14.870
About my dad having another kid.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.816
No.

12:24.908 --> 12:26.742
Maybe you did.

12:26.776 --> 12:28.611
Maybe you didn't.

12:28.816 --> 12:32.299
Maybe you fucked a teenager
and tampered with evidence.

12:33.917 --> 12:36.163
Maybe you're still with her.

12:39.656 --> 12:41.733
He's not in the system.

12:42.663 --> 12:44.827
Probably uses a different name.

12:44.861 --> 12:46.695
I don't think he knows who killed Jesse.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.831
Knows who killed Jesse?

12:48.865 --> 12:51.400
He's the prime fucking suspect, Annie!

12:57.073 --> 12:58.548
Come with me.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.700
Pretty cool town, eh?

13:45.770 --> 13:47.595
Wouldn't be a bad place for us to live.

13:47.629 --> 13:49.550
You know, we came here
before, when you were a baby.

13:49.575 --> 13:50.965
Just you and me.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.101
I took you to this
ah... chicken restaurant.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.443
You were one and a half.

13:54.468 --> 13:56.305
It was the first time I was ever, like,

13:56.339 --> 13:58.005
feeding you by myself.

13:58.030 --> 14:00.931
And I ordered you this
whole chicken dinner.

14:01.244 --> 14:04.035
And the waitress and
everyone is staring at me

14:04.060 --> 14:05.580
like I was such an idiot.

14:05.615 --> 14:08.016
But you know, when that chicken
came, you ate the whole thing.

14:08.051 --> 14:09.251
The people were staring.

14:09.285 --> 14:11.019
They couldn't believe this pig baby

14:11.054 --> 14:13.193
was packing all this food away.

14:14.005 --> 14:15.724
It was like you knew I was embarrassed

14:15.758 --> 14:17.659
and you weren't having it.

14:23.766 --> 14:26.536
Guess we grew up
together, you and me, huh?

14:31.741 --> 14:34.676
- Who's this guy?
- It's him.

14:35.226 --> 14:37.446
That guy is a cop, man.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.148
Have you seen him?

14:39.898 --> 14:41.835
- No.
- You sure?

14:42.359 --> 14:43.986
You think if I had an answer...

14:44.020 --> 14:46.521
that could get you two
lunatics to leave me alone

14:46.556 --> 14:48.156
I'd lie right now?

14:48.191 --> 14:49.820
Get out of here.

14:53.594 --> 14:55.497
How about you guys. You see him around?

14:55.531 --> 14:59.034
Sorry, kitchen's slow today.

15:03.106 --> 15:04.500
What?

15:07.110 --> 15:09.443
"I've been prepping for this mess."

15:09.679 --> 15:12.614
This mess. The mess.

15:12.648 --> 15:15.417
Not this mess. The mess.
As in military slang.

15:15.451 --> 15:17.740
We had the employee list,
but we missed something.

15:18.193 --> 15:21.123
Hey! We need to see your kitchen.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.656
- Why?
- Right now.

15:23.681 --> 15:26.396
I need the names and numbers
of everybody who works here.

15:27.130 --> 15:29.670
Look I'm not the owner. Okay?

15:29.695 --> 15:33.201
I gave you what I have.
People come and go.

15:36.873 --> 15:38.427
Who is this?

15:38.945 --> 15:41.613
That's Bobby. Just quit.

15:41.638 --> 15:43.906
- Bobby who?
- Storms.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.146
Dishwashers, man.

15:49.939 --> 15:51.361
_

15:53.589 --> 15:55.257
Holy shit.

15:56.592 --> 15:58.868
It's like your dad cloned himself.

15:58.995 --> 16:03.415
B&E, assault, arson a few times.

16:03.868 --> 16:05.400
He likes fires.

16:05.435 --> 16:07.407
Gonna have to issue an APB.

16:09.105 --> 16:12.340
He's been in and out of
prison basically for years.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.042
Until a few months ago.

16:14.077 --> 16:15.944
I guess that's when he came back.

16:15.978 --> 16:17.679
"Mr. Storms is a reclusive individual

16:17.713 --> 16:20.148
"who is known to be
difficult to communicate with.

16:20.183 --> 16:21.516
"Previously attended military school

16:21.551 --> 16:23.595
"from the ages of 12 to 16."

16:23.620 --> 16:25.907
That's where he's been. Jesus.

16:26.622 --> 16:29.911
"... Mental issues, anger issues."

16:31.727 --> 16:34.433
He's been from
institution to institution.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.298
He has no one.

16:36.661 --> 16:38.895
Well, I saw Clarence
stick up for some bad guys

16:38.920 --> 16:40.700
'cause of their tough lives.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.771
He never gave up on people.

16:42.805 --> 16:45.173
If he sent his own kid
away, then he had reason.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.277
He's been invisible his whole life.

16:47.302 --> 16:50.012
So you gonna tell me
where you saw him or not?

16:51.973 --> 16:53.949
My dad's being weird.

16:53.983 --> 16:55.317
I think he wants us to move

16:55.351 --> 16:56.856
and forget everything
that happened here.

16:56.881 --> 16:59.106
But I don't want to.

16:59.131 --> 17:01.028
Sounds like my mom.

17:01.183 --> 17:03.583
But, um...

17:06.128 --> 17:09.027
I'm not going back to
the way things were.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.665
I kind of wrecked it.

17:13.035 --> 17:15.103
I did it for Jesse.

17:18.175 --> 17:20.089
I think she'd like it.

17:20.753 --> 17:22.521
So let's give her some.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.558
- Anything?
- No.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.042
Hang on.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.455
Who'd have a campfire up here?

17:33.489 --> 17:34.855
Where are you?

17:34.880 --> 17:36.525
On the path above the cabin.

17:36.559 --> 17:38.120
I'll be right there.

17:44.206 --> 17:47.073
- I like coming here.
- Me too.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.269
There's tire tracks. I'll be right back.

18:54.269 --> 18:55.891
Annie.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.297
Don't tell anyone we're in here.

19:00.610 --> 19:02.310
Look up.

19:20.047 --> 19:22.148
Shhh!

19:23.099 --> 19:24.681
I love you.

19:38.981 --> 19:42.083
Adam! Adam, open the door.

19:42.554 --> 19:44.880
Open the door, Adam! Now!

19:44.905 --> 19:46.843
Adam! Open the door.

19:46.868 --> 19:49.257
You can't keep doing this. Come on.

19:49.292 --> 19:50.898
Go away!

19:51.866 --> 19:54.062
- He's gonna hurt her.
- Adam! I'm serious!

19:54.096 --> 19:55.897
- He's crazy. Adam!
- Open up!

19:55.931 --> 19:57.468
Open the door!

19:57.493 --> 20:00.249
They'll die. Everyone will.

20:00.770 --> 20:02.771
We're all that will be left.

20:03.077 --> 20:06.913
Or maybe we'll have to
die for that to happen.

20:07.316 --> 20:09.070
You're mine.

20:12.014 --> 20:13.468
You're mine.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.117
I love you.

20:17.733 --> 20:19.567
You're mine.

20:28.586 --> 20:30.231
Daisy!

20:30.266 --> 20:32.072
- Daisy! Daisy!
- Help!

20:38.407 --> 20:39.600
Hello.

20:40.734 --> 20:42.092
What?

20:44.580 --> 20:45.914
Peter!

20:45.948 --> 20:47.341
It's Daisy!

21:09.970 --> 21:11.837
You're my whole heart.

21:12.395 --> 21:15.423
I know. You say that all the time.

21:16.037 --> 21:18.181
What you saw...

21:18.870 --> 21:20.556
with Briana...

21:22.391 --> 21:24.064
I'm so sorry. That's not a version of me

21:24.089 --> 21:26.173
I ever want you to see again.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.993
Then don't be that way.

21:30.758 --> 21:33.431
And if you say you miss me all the time,

21:33.456 --> 21:35.853
stop being gone all the time.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.601
Okay, baby.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.648
Is she okay?

21:44.673 --> 21:47.623
Yeah. She's in the water
where Jesse drowned.

21:47.648 --> 21:50.977
Eddie just told me that the
doctor gave her antibiotics.

21:51.011 --> 21:54.560
Apparently there is a
bacteria in that lake.

21:54.585 --> 21:56.582
The killer and Jesse struggled.

21:56.617 --> 21:58.531
They both would've ingested the water.

21:58.556 --> 21:59.919
If the killer was in the lake,

21:59.953 --> 22:02.688
they might have needed
the same drugs afterwards.

22:02.723 --> 22:06.000
It's called... nitazoxinide.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.227
We should get a warrant
for pharmacy records.

22:11.516 --> 22:13.650
I can't. I've gotta stay home.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.195
Can you?

22:15.220 --> 22:17.755
I'll call Brady. I'll talk to you later.

22:20.347 --> 22:21.984
"At 7 o'clock,

22:22.009 --> 22:25.523
"where the hypocrites weekly,
wear the mask of good."

22:27.470 --> 22:29.484
Anything from your brother?

22:29.829 --> 22:31.530
I had a memory.

22:31.969 --> 22:33.867
Did he hurt you?

22:35.542 --> 22:36.942
No.

22:37.837 --> 22:40.057
We were in the closet together...

22:40.082 --> 22:42.681
at our old house in French river.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.666
It was weird. He was...

22:46.931 --> 22:48.677
really possessive.

22:48.882 --> 22:51.383
I think it's why my dad sent him away.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.886
'Cause he thought he might hurt you?

22:54.306 --> 22:56.054
But I don't think he would've.

22:56.089 --> 22:57.923
Well, they must've
thought he was dangerous.

22:57.957 --> 22:59.892
Maybe he wasn't then.

23:04.226 --> 23:05.705
Maybe he just...

23:08.825 --> 23:13.006
he wanted me all for himself, somehow.

23:14.207 --> 23:16.874
He needed to know every second that...

23:17.387 --> 23:19.015
I was all his.

23:20.156 --> 23:21.780
How do you know all this?

23:21.814 --> 23:23.851
'Cause it's what I'm like.

23:25.518 --> 23:26.807
Isn't it?

23:28.521 --> 23:30.096
With you.

23:32.523 --> 23:34.524
I love you too much.

23:35.653 --> 23:37.885
And I need to push you, to...

23:37.910 --> 23:40.755
make sure that you're mine every second.

23:44.408 --> 23:46.972
When you turn away,

23:47.006 --> 23:50.455
or don't answer in a way
that I think bleeds pure love,

23:51.937 --> 23:53.891
I feel pain...

23:54.747 --> 23:57.720
and this need...

23:58.285 --> 23:59.455
to pull you away

23:59.480 --> 24:01.981
from everyone else in the world.

24:04.657 --> 24:07.437
That is what I do to you, isn't it?

24:10.063 --> 24:11.897
'Cause I learned to love from a...

24:11.922 --> 24:14.323
crazy, obsessed guy in a closet.

24:14.616 --> 24:17.413
That isn't how it's
supposed to be. Is it?

24:46.032 --> 24:48.073
I'm leaving, Annie.

24:48.501 --> 24:50.276
I'm taking Daisy.

24:51.070 --> 24:54.596
We can do this together. And change.

24:54.841 --> 24:57.752
We can put all our fucked
up choices behind us.

24:58.620 --> 25:01.480
We can lock them all
in your childhood home.

25:01.514 --> 25:03.643
We just never look back.

25:05.385 --> 25:07.586
If you don't come with me...

25:08.855 --> 25:12.815
I'll fight you for her 'cause
I've gotta get her out of here.

26:50.990 --> 26:53.364
Wasn't you that was supposed to be here.

26:53.908 --> 26:57.567
How does it feel, you fucking lunatic?

26:58.168 --> 27:00.432
How does it feel not to be in control?

27:00.466 --> 27:02.267
Just listening to your voice tells me

27:02.301 --> 27:04.035
that you are out of control.

27:04.060 --> 27:05.770
Oh, I'm fine.

27:06.873 --> 27:10.167
Mostly because I've got a gun on you.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.464
As soon as these people
clear out of here,

27:13.489 --> 27:15.998
I'm gonna take you up
to your boy scout camp

27:16.023 --> 27:18.942
and I'm gonna shoot you in
the face you piece of shit.

27:21.754 --> 27:24.249
A 7-year-old girl you fucked with?

27:24.357 --> 27:26.296
A 7-year-old kid?

27:27.226 --> 27:29.289
Not a man with a gun?

27:30.029 --> 27:32.554
You can try all you want, asshole.

27:33.733 --> 27:35.951
You know, you could just arrest me now.

27:35.976 --> 27:40.414
But then that wouldn't satisfy
your violent urges, would it?

27:40.492 --> 27:43.492
- You're fucking right about that.
- Yeah.

27:48.981 --> 27:51.314
There's just one thing I'd like to say,

27:51.339 --> 27:54.949
before this all ends happily for you.

27:55.321 --> 27:56.816
What's that?

28:53.512 --> 28:57.349
"A lion has come to
lay waste to your land."

29:20.137 --> 29:23.245
Hey. Any, ah, word on that
patient list from New Horizons?

29:23.270 --> 29:25.705
No. I told you it was
gonna take a long time.

29:25.739 --> 29:27.640
What about the pharmacy
records for the antibiotics?

29:27.675 --> 29:29.051
No, not yet.

29:29.076 --> 29:30.457
Annie.

29:32.816 --> 29:35.676
Anthony Greene? The guy
who burned Jed's truck.

29:35.701 --> 29:37.417
- Yeah.
- This is his bank account.

29:37.451 --> 29:38.918
I've been watching it
since he disappeared.

29:38.953 --> 29:41.715
- So?
- So a $1000 went into it yesterday.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.040
And see this?

29:43.065 --> 29:45.334
The deposit has a
police source code on it.

29:45.359 --> 29:46.754
How do you know that?

29:46.779 --> 29:49.143
I used to work for
confidential sources unit.

29:49.168 --> 29:50.849
He's a CI?

29:54.732 --> 29:56.265
You can't do that without Peter.

29:56.290 --> 29:59.025
You can't access someone's
CI codes without...

30:11.183 --> 30:12.684
Brady?

30:19.669 --> 30:20.815
Hey, Ryder.

30:20.840 --> 30:24.401
Hey. I called you like, five times.

30:24.689 --> 30:29.089
Ah, yeah. Shit. The
antibiotics stuff. Sorry.

30:30.499 --> 30:31.866
Anthony.

30:32.742 --> 30:34.347
He's your CI.

30:34.516 --> 30:37.980
I looked up his number, he's
all over your arrest warrants.

30:39.545 --> 30:41.058
What the hell?

30:41.437 --> 30:43.371
You knew we were looking for him.

30:43.396 --> 30:45.893
Yeah. Well, he ratted out Jed.

30:45.918 --> 30:48.230
He was gonna end up at
the bottom of a lake.

30:49.255 --> 30:50.855
So you're still paying him,

30:50.890 --> 30:52.804
out of the kindness of your heart?

30:53.025 --> 30:55.126
Yeah. What else would it be?

30:55.161 --> 30:56.890
Well, where is he then?

30:58.330 --> 30:59.851
I don't know.

31:03.389 --> 31:05.279
Look, this is a mess.

31:05.304 --> 31:07.272
Why don't I meet you at the station.

31:07.306 --> 31:09.107
We'll check on the antibiotics.

31:11.350 --> 31:12.977
Are you going somewhere?

31:13.012 --> 31:15.115
- Camping.
- Oh yeah?

31:15.834 --> 31:18.193
- Where?
- Green point.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.780
I just gotta pee real quick.

31:24.156 --> 31:25.600
Okay.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.101
Who are you going with?

31:36.126 --> 31:38.269
Couple of buddies from high school.

31:38.304 --> 31:40.120
Bit of a reunion.

31:40.727 --> 31:42.206
Oh yeah,

31:42.818 --> 31:44.503
sounds like fun.

31:54.119 --> 31:56.283
How long are you going for?

32:53.027 --> 32:54.627
Hello, this is Chief Peter Welland.

32:54.652 --> 32:56.624
Leave a message after the beep.

32:58.651 --> 33:01.074
Peter... oh my...

33:10.567 --> 33:12.697
Ryder, what do I do?

33:12.731 --> 33:14.532
Why did you come here?

33:14.566 --> 33:16.167
I, I don't know.

33:16.201 --> 33:19.434
Drop your weapon, slowly.

33:19.459 --> 33:21.272
Okay. Shh! It's okay.

33:21.549 --> 33:22.949
Look.

33:34.586 --> 33:36.354
Everyone knows where I am.

33:36.388 --> 33:37.922
Bullshit,

33:38.524 --> 33:40.825
you never tell anyone
where you're going.

33:44.737 --> 33:46.643
If you try anything,

33:47.433 --> 33:51.096
we will go to your house
and I will kill Daisy.

34:02.147 --> 34:05.048
You were the other person
at the church that night?

34:06.585 --> 34:08.386
With Tom and Mother?

34:08.411 --> 34:09.774
Ahuh.

34:12.946 --> 34:15.056
I wasn't with them!

34:16.152 --> 34:17.891
But you saw what happened.

34:19.331 --> 34:21.165
Did they hurt her?

34:21.199 --> 34:22.667
Not physically.

34:25.418 --> 34:27.813
They act like they can help.

34:27.839 --> 34:29.107
This should never have happened.

34:29.141 --> 34:31.274
We're so sorry.

34:31.299 --> 34:32.938
We want you to know that
we're here to make sure

34:32.964 --> 34:34.431
this never happens again.

34:34.456 --> 34:37.634
Nothing like this will
ever happen to you again.

34:37.815 --> 34:40.016
You're important to us,
you're important to this town.

34:40.052 --> 34:41.103
There's gonna be consequences.

34:41.128 --> 34:42.743
- I got your back.
- We'll take care of this.

34:42.775 --> 34:44.542
And then they're all...

34:44.663 --> 34:46.626
you can't go to the cops.

34:46.830 --> 34:50.266
These are our kids,
they're-they're your friends,

34:50.813 --> 34:52.353
the hockey team.

34:52.378 --> 34:54.621
We can do this behind closed doors.

34:54.647 --> 34:56.748
The whole town doesn't
need to know what happened.

34:56.773 --> 34:58.569
But you gotta understand
is they were trying to help.

34:58.604 --> 35:00.038
They beat the fucking shit out of me.

35:00.063 --> 35:01.672
- All right.
- Excuse me?

35:01.707 --> 35:03.695
We've done nothing
but trying to help you.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.931
- They're your friends.
- They're not my friends.

35:05.956 --> 35:08.304
Friends don't do what they did.

35:08.329 --> 35:10.730
This is not about you.
This is about a community.

35:10.755 --> 35:12.140
- We're trying to support you.
- Don't touch me!

35:12.165 --> 35:13.374
We're trying to help you.

35:13.399 --> 35:15.667
We need you, you are our star, and...

35:18.304 --> 35:20.023
We're worried about you and your future.

35:20.048 --> 35:23.179
If you dress like this, there
is gonna be consequences as well.

35:23.595 --> 35:26.398
All this shit, man! It
went on and on and on.

35:26.423 --> 35:27.834
I put my life on the line for you

35:27.859 --> 35:30.010
to be the star player
I think you could be.

35:30.035 --> 35:32.288
None of this would have
happened to you, you little shit,

35:32.313 --> 35:34.172
if you had learned to
control your behavior.

35:34.206 --> 35:36.808
Kill these freak urges
that you feel inside of you.

35:36.833 --> 35:37.881
Stop looking like a princess!

35:37.915 --> 35:38.984
Pull yourself together, Jesse.

35:39.009 --> 35:40.461
You're acting like an abomination.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.587
You don't get to fucking
talk to me like that!

35:42.612 --> 35:45.022
Stop being a fucking abomination.

35:45.047 --> 35:47.375
He's beyond help, so far beyond.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.722
He's a lost cause.

35:48.747 --> 35:52.032
Kill these freak urges
that you feel inside of you.

35:52.057 --> 35:54.250
But they are you.

35:54.275 --> 35:56.677
So hate yourself...

35:58.607 --> 36:01.442
because there isn't room for you here.

36:05.070 --> 36:08.211
I can't imagine what it must
have been like to hear all that.

36:08.236 --> 36:09.781
No! Don't!

36:09.806 --> 36:11.375
Get in the fucking truck!

36:11.410 --> 36:14.202
- Come on, Brady.
- Get in the truck! Now!

36:45.831 --> 36:48.124
You made a lot of good decisions.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.188
Getting Anthony to burn Jed's truck.

36:51.213 --> 36:54.266
Planting the earring on
Jed's lawn. That was smart.

36:55.665 --> 36:57.821
Keeping the white truck
off the registry...

36:58.435 --> 37:00.069
It's Briana's.

37:00.094 --> 37:02.133
It's registered in Sudbury.

37:02.379 --> 37:05.347
And hey, she didn't know anything.

37:13.467 --> 37:15.368
But then you stole the drugs from Eddie,

37:15.403 --> 37:17.795
cause Anthony told you Eddie had them.

37:18.561 --> 37:20.460
Of all people.

37:20.485 --> 37:22.272
My Eddie.

37:23.367 --> 37:25.802
You must've known that I'd find out.

37:27.782 --> 37:30.279
You know me, I never stop.

37:30.635 --> 37:32.403
Why would you do that?

37:35.120 --> 37:38.175
On some level you wanted to get caught.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.891
'Cause you're a good guy.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.901
I'm right, aren't I?

37:44.420 --> 37:47.636
No. I don't know.

37:47.661 --> 37:51.472
You didn't go to the church
intending to hurt anyone.

37:53.925 --> 37:55.672
Why did you go?

37:55.707 --> 37:57.741
I wasn't doing so good.

37:57.999 --> 37:59.749
I ah,

38:00.309 --> 38:04.070
I, I just needed to talk
to Father J for a second.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.812
You know you have a reason,

38:08.421 --> 38:10.546
one that makes you human.

38:11.218 --> 38:12.866
Not a monster.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.491
Yeah.

38:16.694 --> 38:18.162
Have you ever...

38:18.196 --> 38:20.564
have you ever loved something so much,

38:20.598 --> 38:23.945
that you, just want to protect it...

38:24.269 --> 38:25.820
or possess it?

38:25.845 --> 38:28.672
I don't know... I don't
know... I don't know, Ryder.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.148
You just want to own the other person.

38:31.633 --> 38:33.445
But you know,

38:35.747 --> 38:37.079
you know it's messed up.

38:37.104 --> 38:39.101
You know that it's wrong.

38:39.126 --> 38:43.129
I've never seen you care
about anybody that much.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.422
Not anyone except...

38:56.634 --> 38:58.203
I get that love.

39:02.684 --> 39:04.376
In some ways because...

39:05.954 --> 39:07.688
I'm like that.

39:08.446 --> 39:11.743
And in other ways because
I was loved like that.

39:13.985 --> 39:18.108
Am... loved like that.

39:21.273 --> 39:22.941
By my brother.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.985
You don't have a brother, Ryder.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.610
Yes, I do.

39:30.635 --> 39:33.813
He scared my parents
because he loves me too much.

39:34.882 --> 39:37.625
So they kicked him out when I was young.

39:38.343 --> 39:39.633
But...

39:43.326 --> 39:46.135
once you've been loved like that...

39:49.387 --> 39:51.987
so intense and crazy,

39:55.760 --> 39:57.836
but so honest.

39:58.132 --> 39:59.914
It's like a high.

40:02.180 --> 40:03.805
It is honest.

40:06.855 --> 40:09.110
But she hates me for it.

40:14.178 --> 40:15.943
Briana?

40:20.618 --> 40:22.886
It must have felt like
they were talking about you,

40:22.921 --> 40:24.655
in the church.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.978
Like they were judging you.

40:29.271 --> 40:31.285
It's why you picked up Jesse, right?

40:31.310 --> 40:33.664
You were just trying to help?

40:33.698 --> 40:37.365
I just wanted to let him
know that he wasn't alone.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.670
They're people out there everyday

40:39.704 --> 40:41.232
that are struggling with shit.

40:41.257 --> 40:44.284
Every day... and those church assholes,

40:44.309 --> 40:46.543
they have no idea how hard it is.

40:46.577 --> 40:48.312
They don't know what it's
like to have these feelings.

40:48.346 --> 40:50.747
Some days you can't control
it. You try to maintain it,

40:50.782 --> 40:53.834
but it's just too big,
you know. It's too much.

40:58.383 --> 41:01.513
I have been in love with Briana...

41:02.427 --> 41:04.928
for as long as I can remember.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.748
My sister.

41:13.567 --> 41:17.061
You're just... like Tom.

41:17.775 --> 41:19.640
You want me to be you.

41:19.665 --> 41:20.749
I don't know what's wrong with me.

41:20.774 --> 41:23.480
But I always have a way
of provoking every guy

41:23.514 --> 41:24.718
that I date. It's like...

41:24.743 --> 41:26.202
No. Don't. Don't. Don't.

41:26.851 --> 41:29.319
You deserve better than that asshole.

41:29.354 --> 41:31.897
Oh, Briana.

41:35.713 --> 41:37.428
That's really nice.

41:44.961 --> 41:48.522
Brady! What the fuck?!

41:50.065 --> 41:51.833
Oh my God...

41:55.780 --> 41:57.814
You're so fucked.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.850
You're all so fucked.

42:00.339 --> 42:02.407
We're not the same.

42:02.432 --> 42:03.766
What was that?

42:03.791 --> 42:06.459
I'm not who you think I am.

42:06.591 --> 42:09.393
My God. What's wrong with you?

42:09.427 --> 42:12.826
I'm not you, okay? I'm not you.

42:13.297 --> 42:15.098
I'm not sick like you.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.900
You mean sick like me, is that it?

42:16.934 --> 42:18.545
Sick like me? It that
what you're saying?

42:18.570 --> 42:20.139
You little shit!

42:23.937 --> 42:26.672
He woulda told everybody, Ryder.

42:27.293 --> 42:28.612
Brady.

42:28.646 --> 42:31.014
Don't look at me anymore, Ryder.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.483
Don't look at me anymore!

42:39.570 --> 42:40.870
Brady.

42:40.895 --> 42:44.043
- You brought this on yourself.
- Okay. Just...

42:51.264 --> 42:53.504
Brady, this isn't you!

42:56.340 --> 42:58.700
Come on, Brady!
