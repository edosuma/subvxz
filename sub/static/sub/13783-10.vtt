01:47.254 --> 01:49.279
Yeah.

01:49.322 --> 01:52.291
What was in my mind
to raise my hand?

01:52.325 --> 01:53.792
Anyways,

01:53.827 --> 01:57.558
time for breakfast.

01:57.597 --> 02:01.158
- You go ahead.
- Bullshit.

02:01.201 --> 02:03.601
Come on.

02:27.394 --> 02:31.091
Would a letter
to the paper be an idea?

02:31.131 --> 02:33.725
Same time I give
the proposal to Farnum?

02:33.767 --> 02:36.668
- Yes.
- Marshal public sentiment and favor,

02:36.703 --> 02:39.069
maybe fence 'em
in a little.

02:39.105 --> 02:41.096
- Excellent approach.
- Goddamn quicksand

02:41.141 --> 02:44.008
is what these commissioner
positions amount to.

02:44.044 --> 02:45.636
Yes, they do.

02:45.679 --> 02:48.375
It's all a hoot and a holler to you,
though, isn't it, SoI?

02:48.415 --> 02:52.215
- No, it isn't.
- Jesus Christ.

02:52.252 --> 02:55.050
- Breakfast vittles at the ready.
- Mayor.

02:55.088 --> 02:58.057
As far as use for the fees
to be levied on businesses,

02:58.091 --> 03:01.390
I worked a proposal up on a permanent
infirmary and a camp dump.

03:01.428 --> 03:03.487
The first use
for those fees

03:03.530 --> 03:05.623
is paying bribes
to the legislature.

03:05.665 --> 03:07.326
Their bagman's
in transit.

03:07.367 --> 03:10.063
- If there's anything fucking left.
- Why, Mr. Bullock,

03:10.103 --> 03:12.594
you sound like
you want to wring my neck.

03:12.639 --> 03:15.870
Submit your ideas, Bullock,
and by all means,

03:15.909 --> 03:18.434
I'll take them
under advisement.

03:18.478 --> 03:22.005
Always glad to hear from
the camp Health Commissioner.

03:29.489 --> 03:33.585
Give the idea
to the damn paper first.

03:39.566 --> 03:41.090
Please, take your passage.

03:42.102 --> 03:44.093
Cocksucker.

03:52.612 --> 03:54.580
What is this celestial

03:54.614 --> 03:57.208
doing approaching
The Gem's front door?

04:01.888 --> 04:04.015
The tit licker.

04:08.061 --> 04:09.824
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:09.863 --> 04:12.855
- Stop where the fuck you are, Mr. Wu.
- Swe'gen.

04:12.899 --> 04:15.424
Yeah, well, I'll get
Mr. "Swe'gen,"

04:15.468 --> 04:18.028
but first, you gotta
walk the fuck out

04:18.071 --> 04:22.064
- and then come around the back.
- Swe'gen.

04:23.376 --> 04:25.640
Uh, nope, no!
No!

04:25.679 --> 04:28.409
No, closed for a while.
Lick later.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.009
We got us
a situation here, Al!

04:34.254 --> 04:36.188
Come in the front
fucking door.

04:36.222 --> 04:37.951
Bring him up.

04:37.991 --> 04:40.858
You want me to take him out
and bring him around back?

04:40.894 --> 04:42.589
Bring him
the fuck up.

04:45.265 --> 04:47.893
Come on, Mr. Wu.
Come on.

05:08.555 --> 05:11.183
Put him in the chair
and get out, Johnny.

05:11.224 --> 05:13.317
Sit.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.726
Sit!
He won't sit.

05:15.762 --> 05:19.061
- Get out.
- Yes, sir.

05:19.099 --> 05:20.862
What is it, Wu?

05:39.119 --> 05:41.587
Do you think I should
open it back up?

05:41.621 --> 05:43.782
I believe that's what Al
would want.

06:13.586 --> 06:15.144
Mayor.

06:17.290 --> 06:20.282
August commencement
to my administration-

06:21.327 --> 06:24.922
stand stymied
outside a saloon

06:24.964 --> 06:28.161
beside a degenerate
tit licker.

06:28.201 --> 06:30.931
Now, the- this-
this is one of you, huh?

06:36.443 --> 06:39.310
Oh, this-
this is him dead?

06:41.781 --> 06:43.248
And these two.

06:45.685 --> 06:47.619
...cocksucker!

06:47.654 --> 06:49.849
Yeah, glad I taught
you that fucking word.

06:49.889 --> 06:52.119
These are whites, huh?

06:52.158 --> 06:54.888
White cocksucker!

06:56.096 --> 06:58.929
Two white cocksuckers
killed him

06:58.965 --> 07:01.559
and stole the dope
that he was bringing to you.

07:01.601 --> 07:04.035
White cocksucker!
You, Swe'gen.

07:04.070 --> 07:07.301
The dope that you were
gonna fucking sell to me?

07:07.340 --> 07:08.807
White cocksucker.

07:08.842 --> 07:11.140
These two white cocksuckers?
Who the fuck did it?

07:11.177 --> 07:13.702
- Who?
- Who, you ignorant fucking Chink?!

07:13.747 --> 07:15.305
- Wu?!
- Who?!

07:15.348 --> 07:18.840
Who- who stole
the fucking dope?!

07:18.885 --> 07:21.854
- Cocksucker!
- Aw, Jesus.

07:21.888 --> 07:23.719
Those are the first
"cocksuckers"

07:23.757 --> 07:26.123
I have ever heard shouted
from that room, Dan,

07:26.159 --> 07:28.127
that didn't come
from Al's mouth

07:28.161 --> 07:30.789
that wasn't followed
by Al coming over to that railing,

07:30.830 --> 07:32.491
pointing at you
and beckoning you

07:32.532 --> 07:34.864
up them stairs
with your fucking knife.

07:42.041 --> 07:45.306
I begrudge that pervert
his capacity for happiness.

07:45.345 --> 07:48.109
I do.

07:48.148 --> 07:52.551
Them people worship
a fat man seated on his ass.

07:52.585 --> 07:54.985
You listen to me, hmm?

07:55.021 --> 07:57.581
Listen.

07:57.624 --> 07:59.854
I...

07:59.893 --> 08:02.453
find cocksuckers.

08:03.496 --> 08:05.987
I find.

08:06.032 --> 08:08.159
I find dope...

08:08.201 --> 08:11.170
and cocksuckers
who steal...

08:11.204 --> 08:13.695
- fucking dope, huh?
- White cocksucker.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.708
Oh, yeah.

08:15.742 --> 08:18.973
I'll find those
fucking cocksuckers.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.615
Now, get the fuck
out of here, Wu,

08:25.652 --> 08:27.119
the back way,
you understand?

08:27.153 --> 08:30.281
The back way,
or we'll start getting people

08:30.323 --> 08:33.190
having the wrong fucking idea
of things around here, huh?

08:48.241 --> 08:50.209
Where's the dope fiend?

08:50.243 --> 08:52.837
Ain't seen Jimmy Irons
in three or four days.

08:52.879 --> 08:54.676
Fucking find him.

08:59.319 --> 09:01.810
- Morning, E.B.
- Morning, sir.

09:03.456 --> 09:05.924
Anything the mayor
should know?

09:05.959 --> 09:08.826
Name of another tailor.

09:12.632 --> 09:15.123
Didn't we have an engagement
to stuff envelopes, Al?

09:15.168 --> 09:17.295
Not untll I get the currency
to stuff 'em with.

09:32.385 --> 09:34.751
"Any person who
causes offal,

09:34.787 --> 09:36.516
manure, rubbish
or filth

09:36.556 --> 09:38.922
to be discharged in the common areas
of the camp except

09:38.958 --> 09:41.324
in the areas designated
the camp dump,

09:41.361 --> 09:43.761
shall be subject
to a fine of not less than $1

09:43.796 --> 09:45.263
or more than $3,

09:45.298 --> 09:47.630
such revenues
to be used for dump upkeep

09:47.667 --> 09:50.602
and to build and keep up
a camp infirmary. "

09:50.637 --> 09:52.798
That's excellent,
Mr. Bullock.

09:52.839 --> 09:55.034
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Bullock.

09:55.074 --> 09:58.635
- Gentlemen.
- Mrs. Garret.

09:58.678 --> 10:01.272
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

10:01.314 --> 10:03.782
And good morning
to you, young lady.

10:03.816 --> 10:06.307
It's Mr. Bullock's
ideas on

10:06.352 --> 10:08.377
refuse disposal.

10:10.723 --> 10:13.351
It is terribly
crowded today.

10:13.393 --> 10:15.554
- Mmm.
- We were just remarking just yesterday

10:15.595 --> 10:18.393
that it couldn't possibly
get more crowded.

10:19.966 --> 10:22.230
And yet today, it is.

10:39.118 --> 10:41.086
I'm gonna ask
after E.B. Farnum.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.452
Mr. Farnum's
away from the desk.

10:46.859 --> 10:48.827
Gem Saloon,
across the way.

10:48.861 --> 10:50.920
Two rooms.

10:50.964 --> 10:53.296
There's no vacancy, sir.

10:55.234 --> 10:57.225
I'll work it out
while you eat.

10:57.270 --> 10:59.067
There's a man outside
with two horses.

10:59.105 --> 11:01.164
You send the man inside,
see the horses stabled.

11:01.207 --> 11:03.266
- Don't ask no fucking extra for it.
- Yes, sir.

11:11.451 --> 11:14.716
Mr. Farnum's doing
a lined office business.

11:14.754 --> 11:17.120
Or should I say
"Mayor" Farnum?

11:17.156 --> 11:20.592
Don't, unless
you feeI you have to.

11:22.562 --> 11:25.793
That very attractive
solitary woman

11:25.832 --> 11:29.029
is Miss Joanie Stubbs,

11:29.068 --> 11:32.401
a supervisory figure

11:32.438 --> 11:34.633
at Cy Tolliver's
Bella Union Saloon.

11:36.209 --> 11:39.007
- Your cravat's in your bacon.
- Oh.

11:45.985 --> 11:47.976
Fuck this!

11:51.624 --> 11:53.148
Is it fucking
crowded in here

11:53.192 --> 11:55.888
or you just got
some big fucking feet?

11:57.463 --> 11:59.693
Maybe it's the lethal
combination of 'em both.

12:06.706 --> 12:09.903
This one legislator's
named on the list

12:09.942 --> 12:11.637
you were given
twice, Al.

12:11.677 --> 12:14.646
- Lucalis Childs of Bismarck.
- Give him two envelopes.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.046
I'll call him on it
if it ever suits my purpose.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.675
As damp as your
hands are,

12:18.718 --> 12:21.016
why do you continuously
lick your fucking thumb?

12:21.054 --> 12:22.817
Habit, I suppose.

12:22.855 --> 12:25.085
Could you learn the habit
of licking a fucking stump?

12:27.693 --> 12:29.888
If Health Commissioner
Bullock has his way,

12:29.929 --> 12:32.056
some of the levies
meant to defray

12:32.098 --> 12:34.498
the cost of these payoffs
may get diverted.

12:34.534 --> 12:37.526
- To what?
- Infirmary for the camp.

12:37.570 --> 12:41.165
- Garbage dump.
- Well, that type of shit's inevitable.

12:41.207 --> 12:43.505
E.B.,

12:43.543 --> 12:47.274
steal none
of this money.

12:47.313 --> 12:50.214
Gratuitous, hurtfuI
and unnecessary.

12:50.249 --> 12:53.412
When I deal with these
cocksuckers down the road,

12:53.453 --> 12:56.547
I need to be able to look
any one of 'em in the eye,

12:56.589 --> 12:59.456
name what
they were paid

12:59.492 --> 13:01.619
- and know I'm right.
- Understood.

13:01.661 --> 13:03.652
Intact and undiminished.

13:08.267 --> 13:11.168
- What is it, Al?
- Half a chance this could be him.

13:11.204 --> 13:13.729
The bagman?
He wasn't to be here till tonight.

13:16.209 --> 13:18.905
Name's Silas Adams.
I'm looking for E.B. Farnum.

13:18.945 --> 13:21.709
I'm Mayor E.B. Farnum,
Mr. Adams.

13:21.747 --> 13:24.272
And this
is Al Swearengen.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.750
I'm to give this to you
from Magistrate Clagett,

13:30.756 --> 13:32.553
and you're to give
those to me.

13:32.592 --> 13:35.254
Pour yourself
and your friend a drink.

13:40.233 --> 13:42.201
Stop!

13:44.270 --> 13:46.864
You motherless
fucking whores.

13:47.907 --> 13:49.602
Fuck you!

13:49.642 --> 13:51.633
- Fuck me?!
- Gentlemen!

13:52.812 --> 13:55.178
You know what he
says here?

13:55.214 --> 13:58.012
No. You think you should've asked me
that before you motherfucked me?

13:58.050 --> 14:00.610
A double-crossing
cocksucker.

14:00.653 --> 14:02.348
That's Magistrate
Clagett.

14:02.388 --> 14:04.583
Is that the message
you want me to take back to him?

14:04.624 --> 14:07.821
That's the gist of it. Let me put
it a better way before I send you

14:07.860 --> 14:10.192
and your mute friend
back down the fucking trall.

14:10.229 --> 14:12.823
No later
than tonight.

14:12.865 --> 14:15.333
- You giving me a time limit?
- Yeah.

14:16.669 --> 14:19.137
Pussy and whiskey free,
if you want it.

14:19.172 --> 14:20.639
I make my own
arrangements.

14:29.415 --> 14:31.383
Mr. Adams,

14:31.417 --> 14:34.477
may I accompany
you to my hoteI, sir?

14:35.621 --> 14:37.612
Mr. Adams?

14:39.959 --> 14:41.927
Hey, Al.

14:41.961 --> 14:43.553
Dan's got
Jimmy Irons.

14:43.596 --> 14:45.757
Tell him
I'll receive him

14:45.798 --> 14:48.961
in my fucking
chambers, okay?

14:49.001 --> 14:50.992
Get out of here.

14:52.305 --> 14:54.603
- You work out the rooms?
- You gotta share.

14:57.610 --> 14:59.874
Just send up two plates
of fucking food.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.041
And don't spit
in 'em, partner.

15:17.396 --> 15:19.091
Mr. Utter.

15:19.131 --> 15:21.361
I'd 'bout
given up hope.

15:24.470 --> 15:26.461
Yes.

15:38.784 --> 15:40.877
Mighty kind of you,
Miss Stubbs.

15:43.789 --> 15:46.053
How's the freight
business working out?

15:46.092 --> 15:49.118
All a man could wish for
and verging on more than he can handle.

15:49.161 --> 15:50.685
Glad to hear it.

15:55.334 --> 15:58.132
How'd you do looking
for your whorehouse?

15:58.170 --> 16:00.400
I ain't found
a spot yet.

16:01.774 --> 16:04.504
I guess, to be more honest,
I'd say I found a few,

16:04.543 --> 16:08.070
but ain't settled
on one yet, absolutely.

16:08.114 --> 16:10.514
- I see.
- Everyone done? Because if not,

16:10.549 --> 16:12.574
- I fear for our lives.
- I'm done.

16:12.618 --> 16:14.347
Let's take
a nice brisk walk.

16:14.387 --> 16:16.184
Shit. Oh God.
Did I- did I-

16:16.222 --> 16:18.019
did I spill
on anyone?

16:18.057 --> 16:20.685
- No.
- Sorry.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.267
- Where y'all headed?
- Gonna take the air.

16:30.303 --> 16:32.635
Join us
if the opportunity permits.

16:36.642 --> 16:38.610
It's good
to see you, Charlie.

16:38.644 --> 16:40.544
Have a good day.

16:42.915 --> 16:45.850
You too, Miss Stubbs.

16:45.885 --> 16:49.343
Madam, as crowded
as it was yesterday and more so today,

16:49.388 --> 16:52.323
it shows no sign
of becoming less crowded.

16:53.759 --> 16:56.421
You mind getting your ass
out of my shoulder?

17:05.271 --> 17:08.468
You got a rude
fucking mouth, fella.

17:12.778 --> 17:14.837
Conditions
in that dining room

17:14.880 --> 17:16.711
have grown increasingly
oppressive.

17:19.585 --> 17:23.077
- It's crowded, for a fact.
- Price of the camp's success.

17:23.122 --> 17:25.317
That fella was being
smart with you, Merrick.

17:25.358 --> 17:27.622
Your ass was nowhere
near his shoulder.

17:27.660 --> 17:30.595
Well, whatever my proximity,
it was certainly unintentional.

17:30.629 --> 17:32.597
Well, believe me,
I had the angle.

17:32.631 --> 17:35.964
We was just remarking
how tight it's all getting in there.

17:36.001 --> 17:38.401
Ah, yet how many memories
fond to the recollection

17:38.437 --> 17:41.338
have their setting in that
tight little dining room?

17:41.374 --> 17:43.205
Yeah, well,
it's fucked now.

17:43.242 --> 17:44.800
Anyways, we ought
to open soon.

17:44.844 --> 17:46.277
Who would argue
that the venue

17:46.312 --> 17:49.338
was the cause of these happy memories,
nor the bill of fare?

17:49.382 --> 17:53.409
The bitter coffee,
the rancid bacon,

17:53.452 --> 17:55.215
those stale biscuits

17:55.254 --> 17:59.020
that were tomb and grave
to so many insects.

17:59.058 --> 18:01.026
No, gentlemen,

18:01.060 --> 18:03.858
it was the meandering
conversation,

18:03.896 --> 18:06.922
the lingering
with men of character,

18:06.966 --> 18:09.127
some of whom are walking
with me now,

18:09.168 --> 18:11.636
that was such pleasure
to experience

18:11.670 --> 18:13.433
and such a joy
now to recall.

18:13.472 --> 18:16.066
Good of you to say,
Mr. Merrick.

18:16.108 --> 18:18.872
Yeah, back at ya
as far as that goes.

18:18.911 --> 18:21.004
Yeah.

18:22.448 --> 18:25.747
Gentlemen, what's to prevent us
from freeing our friendship

18:25.785 --> 18:28.413
from dependence on that
little dining room?

18:28.454 --> 18:31.821
Relying not on happenstance
and appetite to further

18:31.857 --> 18:34.792
commerce between us,
but on our own conscious choice?

18:36.061 --> 18:38.791
- Meaning what?
- Meaning, Mr. Utter,

18:38.831 --> 18:42.665
the most informal
and disorganized

18:42.701 --> 18:46.102
- of clubs.
- We gotta open, SoI.

18:46.138 --> 18:48.470
Yeah, I don't
join clubs.

18:48.507 --> 18:50.134
Now, now,
its sole purpose

18:50.176 --> 18:52.610
could be just walking
together as we are now.

18:52.645 --> 18:54.408
Well, why don't we
just walk together

18:54.447 --> 18:56.039
when we happen to be out?

18:56.081 --> 18:58.140
We could, or we
could dedicate ourselves

18:58.184 --> 19:00.049
to the principle
of walking together.

19:00.085 --> 19:02.383
Maybe all we need
is a name.

19:02.421 --> 19:03.979
SoI?

19:04.023 --> 19:05.615
We gotta open.

19:05.658 --> 19:08.718
- Yeah, I got freight coming in.
- This was good.

19:08.761 --> 19:10.558
I enjoyed this.

19:10.596 --> 19:12.325
Yeah, we'll
do it again.

19:12.364 --> 19:14.423
- Morning, Mr. Merrick.
- Thank you, Mr. Bullock.

19:14.467 --> 19:16.765
And thank you
for the letter to the editor.

19:21.407 --> 19:23.807
"The Ambulators. "

19:25.110 --> 19:27.704
Huh.

19:27.746 --> 19:29.611
Where have you
been, Jimmy?

19:29.648 --> 19:31.843
So fucking sick,
Mr. Swearengen.

19:31.884 --> 19:34.876
- Chills, fever.
- Yeah, I hear it still in your chest.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.219
Couple times, felt like turning my face
to the fucking wall.

19:38.257 --> 19:39.918
Fucking pale
you are, too.

19:39.959 --> 19:41.688
I- I've rounded
the corner, though.

19:41.727 --> 19:44.287
Plan for my return
today or tomorrow.

19:44.330 --> 19:46.093
Wu's opium courier
was robbed.

19:46.131 --> 19:48.099
Oh, is that so?

19:48.133 --> 19:49.896
Well, was it money
they got or dope?

19:49.935 --> 19:51.926
All his fucking dope.

19:51.971 --> 19:53.495
Uh-oh.

19:53.539 --> 19:56.030
- So you didn't get your resupply.
- No.

19:56.075 --> 19:59.010
- Had you any laid by?
- No, sir.

19:59.044 --> 20:01.376
"Uh-oh,"
eh, Jimmy?

20:01.413 --> 20:03.108
It sounds like
I'm in for a dry time.

20:04.850 --> 20:07.512
Some more aches
and pains coming up for me.

20:07.553 --> 20:10.681
When was Wu supposed
to hear again from California?

20:11.957 --> 20:14.221
Can he even make himself
understood to you?

20:14.260 --> 20:16.228
I'm that amazed
how the fuck you and him

20:16.262 --> 20:19.254
can make yourselves
understood any way to each other.

20:19.298 --> 20:21.858
Jimmy, what become
of that dope-fiend, faro dealer

20:21.901 --> 20:24.995
that I hired to apprise me of what
transpired over at Tolliver's?

20:26.005 --> 20:28.030
Leon?

20:29.041 --> 20:31.032
Leon,
that's right.

20:32.311 --> 20:34.575
Jeez, he just disappeared,
didn't he?

20:34.613 --> 20:37.582
Where the fuck
has he got to?

20:37.616 --> 20:40.449
You've been wrong
since you walked in here.

20:40.486 --> 20:42.420
You know that,
Jimmy, don't you?

20:42.454 --> 20:45.651
Like I said, sir,
I feeI like hell.

20:45.691 --> 20:47.090
Is that what I mean?

20:47.126 --> 20:49.526
Well, what do you mean,
Mr. Swearengen?

20:49.562 --> 20:52.224
You been Iying, Jimmy.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.891
Smell of cat's piss
in this room is so bad,

20:56.936 --> 21:00.838
I want to burn down
the fucking building.

21:00.873 --> 21:03.341
I'm nervous, sir.
I'm always nervous around you.

21:03.375 --> 21:04.842
Nervousness don't
cause that.

21:04.877 --> 21:08.313
Lying causes
cat piss smell.

21:10.649 --> 21:13.777
I want to tear this entire fucking
structure down.

21:16.288 --> 21:19.121
I'll strangle you and throw
you off the balcony,

21:19.158 --> 21:20.682
you stinking
little cocksucker

21:20.726 --> 21:22.626
if you don't
hurry to tell me

21:22.661 --> 21:24.652
where and what's left
of that fucking dope

21:24.697 --> 21:26.927
that you and that other weaseI
have been slamming

21:26.966 --> 21:30.663
into your dope-fiend fucking veins
during your fucking convalescence.

21:30.703 --> 21:32.500
God, Mr. Swearengen-

21:33.505 --> 21:37.305
Jesus, what
a fucking stink!

21:37.343 --> 21:40.471
Not to mention,
you kill a fucking Chink courier

21:40.512 --> 21:43.140
and the headache over that I'm gonna
have with fucking Wu

21:43.182 --> 21:45.082
if I ever get
this fucking stench

21:45.117 --> 21:47.915
- out of my fucking nostrils.
- I just shit myself, sir.

21:47.953 --> 21:49.818
I'm saying it now before
the smell gets you.

21:49.855 --> 21:52.722
- You shit yourself?
- I'm sorry.

21:52.758 --> 21:55.056
Go ahead, throw yourself
off the balcony.

21:55.094 --> 21:57.289
I'm gonna crawI, sir,
I shouldn't stand.

21:57.329 --> 21:59.729
Where's
the fucking dope?

21:59.765 --> 22:01.756
At Leon's,
I'll show you exactly.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.132
I'll tell you everything.
We were four days up in his room.

22:04.169 --> 22:06.831
Hurry the fuck up.
Go on, throw yourself.

22:06.872 --> 22:09.306
And stay in the fucking
muck untll I'm down there.

22:09.341 --> 22:12.435
I just got a splinter the length
of my arm in my fucking palm.

22:12.478 --> 22:14.343
- It's all right.
- Go.

22:14.380 --> 22:16.541
Go, Jimmy.
Come on.

22:16.582 --> 22:19.107
Come on, get your shit-smeared
ass off my balcony.

22:19.151 --> 22:21.449
Go, go, go!

22:26.325 --> 22:28.520
I hurt my arm.
But I'm okay.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.925
You fucking
lie there now.

22:29.962 --> 22:31.827
I'm just gonna
roll forward,

22:31.864 --> 22:33.957
so- so I don't
get trampled.

22:46.011 --> 22:47.979
Jimmy Irons
is in the muck.

22:48.013 --> 22:51.005
Don't let him scuttle off untll Dan
emerges with other orders.

22:53.752 --> 22:55.413
How'd it go
with Jimmy?

22:55.454 --> 22:58.048
Lying thieving cocksucker threw
himself off a balcony.

22:58.090 --> 23:00.024
He'll lead you
to whatever shithole

23:00.059 --> 23:02.391
him and that dope-fiend
faro dealer from Tolliver's

23:02.428 --> 23:04.919
have been using
to slam Wu's junk into their arms.

23:04.963 --> 23:08.023
Change Irons into a pair of the other
cocksucker's trousers

23:08.067 --> 23:10.831
and bring 'em both
back here, plus whatever dope's left.

23:10.869 --> 23:13.133
All right.

23:13.172 --> 23:15.606
- That the reverend idling by the piano?
- Yes, sir.

23:15.641 --> 23:18.769
- Has he explained his presence at all?
- No, sir.

23:18.811 --> 23:22.269
But he ain't been trying
to lead no lost souls to the Lord.

23:22.314 --> 23:23.679
So there's that.

23:28.454 --> 23:30.445
Reverend.

23:32.424 --> 23:34.392
Mr. Swearengen.

23:34.426 --> 23:37.361
- Your new piano plays wonderfully.
- Ain't it delightfuI?

23:37.396 --> 23:40.126
Dave, go get a free
touch from Wanda, huh?

23:44.002 --> 23:45.970
What's the matter
with your eye?

23:46.004 --> 23:48.700
I'm not certain.

23:48.741 --> 23:51.039
Something's been amiss
the last week or so.

23:51.076 --> 23:54.011
Anyways, not wanting
to give offense,

23:54.046 --> 23:56.708
would you mind me
asking you to frequent another joint?

23:58.851 --> 24:00.978
No. No,
I understand.

24:01.019 --> 24:03.112
Man of the cloth slows
business down, huh?

24:03.155 --> 24:05.851
I understand,
certainly.

24:13.031 --> 24:15.556
Hey, what-
what's that then, hmm?

24:15.601 --> 24:18.297
Something amiss
with my leg, as well.

24:22.808 --> 24:25.174
How you dealing
with the fits, huh?

24:25.210 --> 24:28.111
Nothing amiss with those.
They come with some regularity.

24:28.147 --> 24:30.809
- My brother suffered them.
- Did he?

24:32.851 --> 24:36.548
Any case, don't take me
for inhospitable.

24:36.588 --> 24:38.988
Off hours,

24:39.024 --> 24:41.515
any purpose you want
to visit, hmm, hmm?

24:41.560 --> 24:45.052
Incognito or the like,
I'll be happy to make it work.

24:47.399 --> 24:49.924
I just happened
to hear the piano.

24:52.938 --> 24:54.929
All right, Minister.

24:56.775 --> 24:59.073
All right,
Mr. Swearengen.

25:09.021 --> 25:11.182
Fucking new piano.

25:17.429 --> 25:19.056
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

25:19.097 --> 25:21.122
Afternoon, Hostetler.

25:21.166 --> 25:23.896
Afternoon. Now, I got other interests
in my property.

25:23.936 --> 25:26.803
If'n you want it,
better make an offer.

25:26.839 --> 25:29.399
I'm not gonna
make an offer today.

25:29.441 --> 25:32.569
- How much time would you need?
- I don't know.

25:32.611 --> 25:35.079
I said when I was ready,
I'd be by to you.

25:35.113 --> 25:37.479
You don't want
to rush me.

25:39.518 --> 25:41.713
I was giving you
first opportunity.

25:41.753 --> 25:44.153
- No one is rushing you.
- All right.

25:44.189 --> 25:46.953
Fair offer from other interests,
I'm gonna take it.

25:48.493 --> 25:50.484
All right,
Hostetler.

25:51.597 --> 25:53.087
I'll be having
a pickaxe.

25:53.131 --> 25:54.621
Bargain at $7.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.601
It's open.

26:06.511 --> 26:08.775
- Hi ya, kid.
- Hi, Eddie.

26:15.220 --> 26:18.155
Did that blood stain
get you the special rate?

26:20.959 --> 26:22.950
Have a seat, Eddie.

26:22.995 --> 26:26.226
I'd offer you a drink,
but I don't have any booze.

26:29.835 --> 26:31.962
Settle on a location
for your new place yet?

26:32.004 --> 26:33.596
I'm looking.

26:33.639 --> 26:35.129
Good.

26:37.075 --> 26:39.976
- That's a lie.
- Long as it's the only one you told me.

26:40.012 --> 26:41.479
I don't want
Cy to back me,

26:41.513 --> 26:43.811
and I don't know how
to do anything without him.

26:43.849 --> 26:45.544
I'll back you.

26:45.584 --> 26:47.415
You don't have
that kind of money.

26:47.452 --> 26:49.852
- I will.
- You gonna turn prospector, Eddie?

26:49.888 --> 26:51.685
I'm gonna rob Cy.

26:51.723 --> 26:54.521
Don't, Eddie.
He'll know.

26:54.559 --> 26:56.186
What's the time, kid?

26:59.865 --> 27:03.130
No, he won't.

27:03.168 --> 27:04.965
I do business
with this fucking man.

27:05.003 --> 27:07.335
Wu does 50 fucking
things for me.

27:07.372 --> 27:10.705
You rob his fucking courier
and kill the cocksucker.

27:10.742 --> 27:12.676
What the fuck do
I do with you, huh?

27:12.711 --> 27:14.941
I'm so fucked up,
Mr. Swearengen.

27:14.980 --> 27:17.210
I can't make a case
for myself.

27:17.249 --> 27:18.944
Well, what would
you want to say?

27:18.984 --> 27:22.112
From you, I have received
no service of any kind at any point.

27:22.154 --> 27:24.554
That chair would
make a better spy.

27:25.724 --> 27:27.885
I've worked hard for you,
Mr. Swearengen.

27:27.926 --> 27:30.486
- My habit's a fuckin' curse.
- Oh God.

27:30.529 --> 27:32.963
I wish the fuck I never
took up opium in my life.

27:32.998 --> 27:35.398
If something might persuade you,
Mr. Swearengen,

27:35.434 --> 27:38.369
to say you couldn't find us and give
us a day's start out of camp...

27:38.403 --> 27:41.964
You got almost half the dope back,
maybe a little less.

27:44.209 --> 27:46.302
So I give him a little
less than half the dope,

27:46.345 --> 27:49.371
which you being the cat
piss stinking liars you are,

27:49.414 --> 27:52.781
he'll probably draw a picture explaining
to me is 10% of the dope.

27:52.818 --> 27:57.346
And then I'll probably draw a picture
for him, portraying myself a cunt!

27:57.389 --> 27:59.289
'Cause in that Chink
mind of his,

27:59.324 --> 28:03.090
I'm supposed to bring you to him
for his pig's fucking supper.

28:03.128 --> 28:05.255
Please fucking God,
Mr. Swearengen,

28:05.297 --> 28:07.663
don't give us to Wu
for his pigs.

28:34.893 --> 28:38.056
We're here to be overcharged
on some fucking meat.

28:38.096 --> 28:41.395
Will Your Chink Highness
fucking permit us to go inside

28:41.433 --> 28:44.061
and get robbed blind
on a side of elk?

28:57.382 --> 29:00.442
I found the cocksuckers
that stole your dope

29:00.485 --> 29:03.784
and that's what's left
of the fucking shipment.

29:03.822 --> 29:06.120
Cocksuckers!

29:06.158 --> 29:08.456
Oh yeah, I'm all
fucking for it, Wu.

29:08.493 --> 29:10.654
But neither of us
would have reached

29:10.695 --> 29:13.994
our present comfortable position
freezing our balls off

29:14.032 --> 29:16.899
if we didn't understand
you can't cut the throat

29:16.935 --> 29:19.699
of every cocksucker whose
character it would improve.

29:19.738 --> 29:21.330
Cocksucker.

29:21.373 --> 29:25.366
What happens after
the white cocksuckers' throats

29:25.410 --> 29:29.710
have been cut and two dozen
more white cocksuckers

29:29.748 --> 29:32.273
get their loads on
and decide to teach you

29:32.317 --> 29:34.581
and all your Chink friends
a fucking lesson?

29:34.619 --> 29:37.486
Who's gonna walk away
from that get-together, huh, Wu?

29:37.522 --> 29:39.649
Cocksucker!

29:41.093 --> 29:43.391
Yeah.

29:43.428 --> 29:45.589
Cocksucker.

29:45.630 --> 29:48.155
Swe'gen bring
you cocksucker.

29:49.801 --> 29:52.599
- Swe'gen.
- But only one, Wu.

29:52.637 --> 29:55.435
One cocksucker,
not two.

30:00.846 --> 30:03.212
Cocksucker.

30:03.248 --> 30:05.113
One.

30:06.284 --> 30:07.751
No two.

30:07.786 --> 30:11.688
I give up two whites
for one Chink,

30:11.723 --> 30:15.420
when they're finished stringing you up,
they'll come get me.

30:17.329 --> 30:19.058
How much?

30:20.699 --> 30:22.189
Swe'gen.

30:33.979 --> 30:36.914
Even money this'll end up
a fucking bloodbath.

30:42.287 --> 30:45.347
Every fucking time I come
with one price in mind

30:45.390 --> 30:47.051
and leave having
paid in double.

30:47.092 --> 30:48.753
How does this Wu
do it to me, huh?

30:48.793 --> 30:50.784
Think these Chinks
understand you?

30:50.829 --> 30:52.763
They understand
my fucking attitude.

30:52.797 --> 30:54.355
That he's a fucking
wily big shot.

30:54.399 --> 30:56.128
Builds him up
amongst his people.

30:56.168 --> 30:58.329
Take them two dope-fiends
over to the baths

30:58.370 --> 31:01.703
while I converse with Tolliver over
which one gets murdered.

31:05.610 --> 31:08.807
It's a nice
piece of meat.

31:10.248 --> 31:12.273
So cut a piece off
for yourself,

31:12.317 --> 31:15.184
put the rest in the cellar,
then take them hoople heads to the bath.

31:17.455 --> 31:18.820
Nice meat!

31:45.684 --> 31:48.653
If it's your missing
faro dealer you're drinking over,

31:48.687 --> 31:51.485
he just threw up
in my office.

31:51.523 --> 31:54.117
Had you been sharing space
with him a while?

31:54.159 --> 31:55.956
Only long enough
to find out

31:55.994 --> 31:58.121
him and a fellow dope-fiend
who works for me

31:58.163 --> 32:01.690
robbed and murdered
a Chink opium courier.

32:02.968 --> 32:05.436
Leon, Leon, Leon.

32:05.470 --> 32:09.031
Second best thimble rigger I ever saw
when he wasn't chasing the dragon.

32:09.074 --> 32:12.669
You do realize I'm presenting you
with a mutual problem.

32:12.711 --> 32:16.670
Which I expect's a little ways down
the road, so I'm waxing philosophical

32:16.715 --> 32:18.239
till you tell me
what you want.

32:18.283 --> 32:20.581
I made a deal
with the boss Chink

32:20.619 --> 32:23.179
to give him one
of the two dope-fiends.

32:23.221 --> 32:25.849
Do I assume some piece
of the opium

32:25.890 --> 32:27.721
this courier bore
was intended for you?

32:27.759 --> 32:32.219
Ah, so you got a reason
to keep the Chink boss happy.

32:32.264 --> 32:34.528
I don't, so I can
stand on principle.

32:35.734 --> 32:38.669
What's your
fucking principle?

32:38.703 --> 32:40.466
A white dope-fiend's
still white.

32:40.505 --> 32:42.666
I don't deliver
white men to Chinks-

32:42.707 --> 32:44.436
Leaving me with
a bag of shit to hold.

32:44.476 --> 32:47.377
Maybe you should think harder
about trafficking in fucking junk.

32:47.412 --> 32:50.711
I'm a purveyor of spirits,
Cy, dope fucking included,

32:50.749 --> 32:54.708
and when chance affords, a thief,
but I ain't no fucking hypocrite.

32:54.753 --> 32:58.553
I think we're done, Al.

32:59.658 --> 33:01.717
But in my line,
I'm used to certain types

33:01.760 --> 33:04.126
thinking they need
the last word.

33:04.162 --> 33:07.325
No, my last word is the fucking
bagman's here from Yankton,

33:07.365 --> 33:09.526
so get up
your fucking share.

33:15.907 --> 33:17.568
Where's fucking
Joanie staying?

33:17.609 --> 33:20.169
I don't know, Cy.

33:20.211 --> 33:21.769
Ah, don't fucking
lie to me.

33:21.813 --> 33:25.214
I don't know.

33:25.250 --> 33:28.686
If you see her
at whatever fucking place

33:28.720 --> 33:31.280
you don't know
where she's staying at,

33:31.323 --> 33:34.156
tell her I have some good
fucking news for her

33:34.192 --> 33:36.752
about upcoming real estate
availabilities

33:36.795 --> 33:38.786
if she'd ever show up
to hear about it.

33:40.532 --> 33:42.796
- Okay?
- Sure, boss.

33:43.968 --> 33:45.458
Thank you.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.909
That ain't right, see?

34:25.944 --> 34:28.242
My father was
a preacher of the Word

34:28.279 --> 34:29.473
and that ain't right.

34:40.859 --> 34:43.793
So this what it's come
to in Deadwood, eh, Doc?

34:43.828 --> 34:45.819
Ministers kicking up
their heels

34:45.864 --> 34:48.799
and Chinamen walking
through the front door?

34:51.569 --> 34:55.369
You know, when you giggle,
you leak piss.

34:56.975 --> 35:00.411
- Poor fucking man.
- Let me see your arm.

35:02.714 --> 35:04.875
It's fine, Doc,
it's better.

35:08.520 --> 35:12.081
Quit acting like
a goddamn fooI and sit down.

35:19.264 --> 35:21.164
Get the fuck
away from him!

35:21.199 --> 35:23.292
Shut that
fucking piano down!

35:23.334 --> 35:26.462
Hey, big time, fuck 'em
or get the fuck out!

35:27.539 --> 35:29.837
Did we not come
to an understanding?

35:29.874 --> 35:31.239
In what connection, sir?

35:31.276 --> 35:33.676
In the connection
of you staying the fuck out of here.

35:33.711 --> 35:36.509
I don't recall that, sir.

35:36.548 --> 35:40.644
- Do you wish me to leave?
- Yeah, I wish you to fucking leave.

35:40.685 --> 35:44.212
Write yourself a note and hang it over
your one good fucking eye:

35:44.255 --> 35:48.783
- "Stay out of Al Swearengen's joint. "
- All right, sir.

35:48.827 --> 35:52.524
"Stay the fuck out of The Gem, whatever
my fucking problem is," hmm?

35:52.564 --> 35:54.429
I was drawn
to the music.

35:54.466 --> 35:57.458
The piano relieves
my headache.

35:57.502 --> 36:01.233
Listen to a piano where you don't make
a fucking ass out of yourself, huh?

36:03.241 --> 36:06.768
- Do you know where I might find one?
- No!

36:06.811 --> 36:08.938
Help him
the fuck out, huh?

36:15.453 --> 36:17.284
Come on.

36:20.625 --> 36:23.116
What the fuck
was that?

36:23.161 --> 36:25.220
He's having changes
in his brain.

36:25.263 --> 36:27.060
I hope to Christ
he's having changes.

36:27.098 --> 36:30.090
I'd hate to think of him
conducting performances like that

36:30.134 --> 36:32.295
of secret evenings
in the forest and the like.

36:32.337 --> 36:33.770
I'm certain now
it's a tumor.

36:33.805 --> 36:35.864
- That caused the fits too, huh?
- Yes.

36:35.907 --> 36:38.967
You notice now too
he's staring cockeyed?

36:39.010 --> 36:41.911
He was in here not two hours ago.
Don't fucking remember.

36:44.015 --> 36:46.279
- Nothing to be done, huh?
- No.

36:47.986 --> 36:49.681
He ain't coming
back in my joint.

36:49.721 --> 36:51.882
He's a man of the cloth
in case he forgets.

36:51.923 --> 36:54.289
Kicking up his legs
like a four-bit strumpet.

36:55.593 --> 36:58.426
How's Trixie's spirits
seem to you, huh?

36:58.463 --> 37:02.297
- Her abscess seems fine.
- That ain't what I asked!

37:02.333 --> 37:06.997
And I don't answer for
the state of people's spirits.

37:13.511 --> 37:16.571
Come on! Buy a drink!
Get your pricks sucked!

37:16.614 --> 37:19.048
Spend some fucking
money, huh?!

37:20.084 --> 37:22.348
It ain't circumstance.

37:22.387 --> 37:25.686
It's my own fucking
mettlesome nature.

37:25.723 --> 37:27.987
- Far as what?
- What I've done, SoI.

37:28.026 --> 37:30.859
And you have
to admire me for it.

37:30.895 --> 37:34.524
It's moved 300 miles
to set the damn situation up

37:34.566 --> 37:37.091
I left Montana
to get away from.

37:39.070 --> 37:42.198
Drawing up proposals
for refuse disposal.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.502
Unsolicited.

37:43.541 --> 37:46.840
Insulted Hostetler
out of my own fucking irritability.

37:46.878 --> 37:49.108
I believe Hostetler's
had worse afternoons.

37:49.147 --> 37:51.479
Wife and child
I barely know.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.481
I don't guess
you need me to say it.

37:59.223 --> 38:02.852
If there's a heaven, your brother
sees what you did and he's gratefuI.

38:02.894 --> 38:05.761
Maybe he sees me
borrowing his life

38:05.797 --> 38:07.958
so I didn't have
to live my own.

38:07.999 --> 38:10.968
People have made good lives
out of borrowed ones before.

38:15.106 --> 38:18.337
But she
is a beautifuI woman.

38:20.445 --> 38:24.347
Them stuffed envelopes
for those cunts at the legislature,

38:24.382 --> 38:27.715
past smoothing the road
for the camp's annexation,

38:27.752 --> 38:30.687
they were supposed to clear
up a personal situation.

38:30.722 --> 38:33.020
But that letter you bore
from the magistrate

38:33.057 --> 38:36.857
explained my situation would
need additional envelopes.

38:36.894 --> 38:38.725
Not my problem.

38:40.164 --> 38:43.190
But you'd understand
how a man would feeI aggrieved,

38:43.234 --> 38:46.726
learning that he bribed
a legislator to annex a camp,

38:46.771 --> 38:48.966
but hadn't got
the sold-out cocksuckers

38:49.007 --> 38:51.134
to lift the murder
warrant against him?

38:51.175 --> 38:53.837
How he'd feeI that
he spent a lot of time,

38:53.878 --> 38:57.609
and trouble and expense
for the privilege of getting hanged?

38:57.649 --> 39:00.083
Not so far I'd excuse
him motherfucking me

39:00.118 --> 39:01.745
that only bore
the message.

39:01.786 --> 39:03.686
No.

39:05.456 --> 39:08.084
I'm here to take your message back
to the magistrate.

39:08.126 --> 39:11.562
Who I'd be surprised is a Iying,
thieving double-crossing cocksucker

39:11.596 --> 39:13.496
only in his
dealings with me.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.963
Yeah.

39:18.002 --> 39:21.529
- Magistrate Clagett is a cocksucker.
- And?

39:21.572 --> 39:24.063
Make your offer.

39:29.113 --> 39:31.946
How can you prove you're not here
to catch me in a switch?

39:31.983 --> 39:33.678
I'm not here
to prove shit to you.

39:33.718 --> 39:37.176
Does it matter to you the cocksucker
the warrant's out on me for killing

39:37.221 --> 39:39.712
needed murdering
every fucking day he drew breath?

39:39.757 --> 39:42.885
- No.
- Good.

39:45.997 --> 39:48.625
Gotta go to the bathhouse.
You want to accompany me?

39:50.802 --> 39:53.930
No one's looking
to fuck you up the ass.

39:53.971 --> 39:55.962
I gotta execute someone.

40:02.313 --> 40:04.747
Here's the situation:

40:04.782 --> 40:08.684
Two dope-fiends
rob and murder an opium courier.

40:08.720 --> 40:11.518
Dope-fiends are white,
opium courier's a Chink.

40:12.557 --> 40:14.525
So far, who cares?

40:14.559 --> 40:16.686
The Chink who paid
for the delivery

40:16.728 --> 40:19.253
is a boss amongst
his own, goes berserk.

40:20.298 --> 40:22.357
Matter of indifference
still, huh?

40:23.568 --> 40:26.537
Some of the dope should
have been delivered

40:26.571 --> 40:30.405
by the boss Chink
to a pillar of the white community,

40:30.441 --> 40:32.534
a wonderfuI man.

40:33.811 --> 40:35.972
One of the dope-fiends
works for him.

40:36.013 --> 40:38.208
The other one works
for a clever cocksucker

40:38.249 --> 40:39.944
who could be
considered his rival,

40:39.984 --> 40:43.181
and who is watching us
from his balcony even as we speak.

40:45.623 --> 40:47.454
Thank you for
not looking.

40:47.492 --> 40:49.790
The boss Chink
wants to feed

40:49.827 --> 40:51.818
both the dope-fiends
to his pigs.

40:51.863 --> 40:53.330
No.

40:53.364 --> 40:54.854
Would you
give him one?

40:58.369 --> 41:01.463
Is the boss Chink the only source
of opium in the camp?

41:01.506 --> 41:03.167
Yup.

41:03.207 --> 41:05.903
Any other business
connections with the white pillar?

41:07.345 --> 41:08.835
Several.

41:10.047 --> 41:11.537
I'd give him one.

41:11.582 --> 41:13.982
Let the dope-fiends
draw fucking straws.

41:14.018 --> 41:16.145
Clever cocksucker
won't consent to that.

41:16.187 --> 41:18.018
Don't want his man
in a lottery

41:18.055 --> 41:20.819
that could deliver
him to a Chink.

41:20.858 --> 41:23.622
Is the clever cocksucker
spoiling for a fight?

41:23.661 --> 41:24.992
Al.

41:25.029 --> 41:26.792
What you asked
for earlier...

41:30.168 --> 41:32.693
I suspect that's who
it's intended for.

41:32.737 --> 41:34.364
Smart thinking.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.932
This is Lilah.

41:39.110 --> 41:41.237
Say hello
to the fellas, Lilah.

41:41.279 --> 41:42.746
Hello, fellas.

41:42.780 --> 41:44.873
Speaks, too.

41:44.916 --> 41:47.180
Be a big earner
for you, Cy.

41:49.887 --> 41:52.447
- Maybe he is spoiling for a fight.
- Felt that way to me.

41:52.490 --> 41:54.185
No one asked
you how it felt.

41:54.225 --> 41:56.557
My money'd be on him trying
to put the Chink boss

41:56.594 --> 41:58.562
in the wrong in the eyes
of the camp.

41:58.596 --> 42:01.156
Anyways, thank God
I don't have to rely on you

42:01.199 --> 42:03.429
to formulate
my plan of action.

42:03.467 --> 42:04.957
You with me?

42:06.037 --> 42:07.800
Yeah, I'm with you.

42:19.584 --> 42:21.779
Mr. Swearengen.

42:21.819 --> 42:26.153
Al, we are good
and fucked up.

42:26.190 --> 42:28.385
We are fucked up,
Mr. Swearengen.

42:28.426 --> 42:31.623
- What have we been saying repeatedly?
- Al's a good guy.

42:31.662 --> 42:35.826
That you'd fucking
allow us our works here

42:35.867 --> 42:38.597
and us periodically
fixing the entire time

42:38.636 --> 42:40.399
we're in the fucking tub,

42:40.438 --> 42:44.397
after how we inconvenienced
you and fucked you up.

42:44.442 --> 42:47.070
Fucked up our
own fucking lives

42:47.111 --> 42:49.841
from the time I was
a fucking child.

42:49.881 --> 42:52.213
Al.

42:52.250 --> 42:55.344
Thank you, Mr. Swearengen,
and you are a good guy.

43:00.191 --> 43:01.453
Thank you, Al.

43:01.492 --> 43:04.620
One of you is gonna
have to apologize to Wu.

43:07.331 --> 43:10.300
- Apologize?
- I'll apologize.

43:10.334 --> 43:12.859
Bring that slant-eyed
bastard over here.

43:12.904 --> 43:14.769
He can get in the fucking
tub with me.

43:14.805 --> 43:16.932
I'll apologize

43:16.974 --> 43:19.340
and then I'll kiss him.

43:19.377 --> 43:22.437
And then I'll tie him off
and I'll shoot him up

43:22.480 --> 43:25.381
and then I'll blow him

43:25.416 --> 43:27.247
with fucking soap.

43:27.285 --> 43:29.378
We're gonna draw straws...

43:30.655 --> 43:33.488
to see who goes
over to see Wu.

43:33.524 --> 43:35.822
We go there?

43:36.894 --> 43:39.362
I withdraw my volunteer.

43:39.397 --> 43:41.490
I am comfortable
where I am.

43:49.674 --> 43:51.574
You're gonna
pick a straw, Jimmy.

43:56.380 --> 44:00.111
Well, when you say
apologize, sir,

44:00.151 --> 44:02.210
could you be specific
what's gonna happen?

44:02.253 --> 44:05.347
Short straw
apologizes.

44:05.389 --> 44:08.483
But then what the fuck
is Wu gonna do?

44:08.526 --> 44:10.323
I worked it out with Wu.

44:10.361 --> 44:12.591
You don't think I'd be here unless
I'd worked it out with Wu.

44:12.630 --> 44:15.793
So an apology's
gonna be enough?

44:15.833 --> 44:18.825
We happen
to be fucking white.

44:18.869 --> 44:20.302
In case you
hadn't noticed,

44:20.338 --> 44:23.068
he happens to be a fucking slant-eyed
fucking celestial.

44:23.107 --> 44:25.632
He's lucky to get
a fucking apology.

44:25.676 --> 44:27.735
He's lucky we're willing
to do even that.

44:29.046 --> 44:31.037
- Well, why do I gotta pick?
- I'll pick.

44:31.082 --> 44:33.573
I don't fucking mind.
Don't be fucking afraid.

44:33.617 --> 44:36.677
You be afraid your whole life
of every fucking thing.

44:36.721 --> 44:39.588
You want me to pick, Al?
I'll pick.

44:39.623 --> 44:43.150
And then I'll blow
myself with fucking soap.

44:46.130 --> 44:47.620
Pick, Jimmy.

44:57.875 --> 44:59.342
Show me.

44:59.377 --> 45:01.675
Uh, would you show me
the straws, please, sir?

45:01.712 --> 45:03.907
So I know one's
long and one's short.

45:03.948 --> 45:05.711
Pick.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.980
Can I get off
again first?

45:22.867 --> 45:27.167
Is that the short one
or the long one?

45:37.982 --> 45:40.109
Do not throw up.

45:40.151 --> 45:42.119
I don't want
to smell your stink!

45:51.362 --> 45:54.126
- Reverend Smith.
- Evening, sir.

45:59.136 --> 46:01.195
- Evening.
- Reverend.

46:04.141 --> 46:07.440
I watched goods
in the tent this uh,

46:07.478 --> 46:11.278
this structure replaced
while Messieurs...

46:11.315 --> 46:14.842
Bullock and Star
first took in the camp.

46:14.885 --> 46:17.046
You sure did.

46:17.088 --> 46:19.079
What can we do
for you, Reverend?

46:23.260 --> 46:25.626
I'm in a quandary,
gentlemen.

46:29.700 --> 46:32.032
Are you Messieurs
Bullock and Star?

46:32.069 --> 46:33.866
In the flesh.

46:41.445 --> 46:44.141
You are the absolute
images of them, gentlemen.

46:44.181 --> 46:48.811
But what makes me afraid
is I do not recognize you as my friends.

46:50.054 --> 46:52.022
And naturally,
I am afraid.

46:52.056 --> 46:53.751
What are you
afraid of, sir?

46:53.791 --> 46:56.817
I don't know what's
happening to me.

46:56.861 --> 46:58.556
I have various ailments,

46:58.596 --> 47:01.121
and I suppose this
is a further ailment,

47:01.165 --> 47:02.792
but of what sort,
I don't know.

47:06.837 --> 47:08.896
And I'm afraid
if you are devils,

47:08.939 --> 47:11.169
which I don't
believe you are,

47:11.208 --> 47:15.872
because you were the kindest men
of all in the camp to me-

47:15.913 --> 47:18.177
but if you were devils,
I suppose that-

47:18.215 --> 47:20.945
that would be the type
of shape you would take,

47:20.985 --> 47:22.816
and- and if you
are not devils, I-

47:25.256 --> 47:27.656
then I am-

47:29.627 --> 47:31.356
I am simply
losing my mind.

47:31.395 --> 47:35.422
And with my
other ailments,

47:35.466 --> 47:39.630
I am concerned
and afraid.

47:41.005 --> 47:42.905
All right, Reverend.

47:42.940 --> 47:46.273
We're the people you met
the night you watched our goods.

47:46.310 --> 47:48.642
I'm from Etobicoke,
Ontario.

47:48.679 --> 47:50.977
I'm from Vienna,
Austria.

47:56.086 --> 47:57.713
WonderfuI.

47:57.755 --> 47:59.848
You're here
with friends.

48:01.792 --> 48:04.955
Yes, yes,
I feeI that now.

48:04.995 --> 48:08.158
And I have
various ailments

48:08.199 --> 48:09.962
of which
we all suffer.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.663
And next morning often
finds us feeling better.

48:13.704 --> 48:16.229
Yes.

48:16.273 --> 48:18.764
In any case,
part of God's plan.

48:19.910 --> 48:21.844
May we walk you back
to your tent, sir?

48:25.849 --> 48:29.080
An evening stroll
with friends.

48:29.119 --> 48:30.848
I would
so enjoy that.

48:30.888 --> 48:32.788
Let's go then.

48:49.073 --> 48:52.167
Mr. Swearengen's
saloon has a new piano.

49:07.191 --> 49:09.785
You tell your boss.

49:09.827 --> 49:11.351
Tell him what
you saw here, huh?

49:11.395 --> 49:14.023
I saw a fair procedure.

49:14.064 --> 49:16.692
I saw a fair procedure, Al,
to tell Mr. Tolliver.

49:18.369 --> 49:20.462
Oh God!

49:20.504 --> 49:24.167
Do not fucking
call me Al.

49:42.026 --> 49:45.427
I guess Tolliver achieved his purpose
standing on that balcony.

49:49.433 --> 49:52.630
- Why'd you kill your own guy?
- Why?

49:52.670 --> 49:56.106
You give Tolliver's dope-fiend to the
boss Chink instead of your own guy,

49:56.140 --> 49:58.938
gives Tolliver the opening
to make the boss Chink

49:58.976 --> 50:01.001
look wrong in the eyes
of the whites.

50:01.045 --> 50:04.742
And he can go to war
with me and make me out a Chink lover.

50:04.782 --> 50:08.115
What if my guy had
drawn the long straw?

50:08.152 --> 50:11.349
I guess he'd have
been shit out of luck.

50:11.388 --> 50:15.119
Mr. Adams, don't think
there was a long straw.

50:15.159 --> 50:17.525
Mr. Adams, Mr. Dority.

50:17.561 --> 50:20.223
- Silas.
- Dan.

50:20.264 --> 50:22.232
Silas, lift your lid.

50:23.567 --> 50:26.365
Yeah.
Get a fucking haircut.

50:26.403 --> 50:28.462
Looks like your mother
fucked a monkey.

50:41.318 --> 50:45.812
Wu, here's that cocksucker
to apologize.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.328
Say you're sorry,
Jimmy.

51:07.144 --> 51:09.112
Swe'gen.

51:09.146 --> 51:11.808
Yeah.

51:11.849 --> 51:16.445
Swe'gen hopes we ain't signed
ourselves up for killing too.

51:51.054 --> 51:53.079
& And the hog
of the forsaken &

51:53.123 --> 51:55.148
& Got no reason
to cry &

51:55.192 --> 51:58.958
& He got to chew the angels
fallen from up high &

51:58.996 --> 52:00.896
& He ain't waitin'
for no answer &

52:00.931 --> 52:02.523
& Bakin' woefuI pie &

52:02.566 --> 52:04.329
& Pie of eyesight,
pie blue black &

52:04.368 --> 52:08.930
& Whoa that pie,
the pie of by and by &

52:11.909 --> 52:13.877
& And the hog
of the forsaken &

52:13.911 --> 52:15.879
& Well, he ain't like
you and I &

52:15.913 --> 52:19.747
& With bones always breakin'
and no place to go lie &

52:19.783 --> 52:21.683
& He sit in the box
so dark and wet &

52:21.718 --> 52:23.583
& He got
so much time &

52:23.620 --> 52:25.588
& He ain't even
worried yet &

52:25.622 --> 52:27.385
& The hog
of the forsaken &

52:27.424 --> 52:30.416
& He is the pork
of crime. &
