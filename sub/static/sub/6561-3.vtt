WEBVTT

00:10.044 --> 00:11.145
- FIVE HOURS OF DANCING.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.746
- SEVEN HOURS OF HARMONIES.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.549
- AND I SWEATED
THROUGH 14 BANDANNAS.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.386
- THANK GOODNESS WE CAN ESCAPE
THE STRESSES OF HOLLYWOOD

00:18.452 --> 00:19.887
AT THE AMAZING PALMWOODS POOL.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.322
[bell rings]
- WHAT'S THIS?

00:21.389 --> 00:22.756
I DIDN'T ORDER EXTRAS.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.458
- WE LIVE HERE.
THIS IS OUR POOL.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.094
- NO, THIS IS THE SET

00:26.160 --> 00:28.028
FOR THE SEXY DOG
DOG FOOD COMMERCIAL,

00:28.096 --> 00:30.464
STARRING LIGHTNING
THE TV WONDER DOG.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.333
all: HEY, LIGHTNING.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.868
- STRIKE THE BOYS.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.105
- WHAT'S THAT?

00:37.171 --> 00:38.739
- UH!

00:38.806 --> 00:42.143
- WELL, AT LEAST WE CAN RECHARGE
IN THE STYLISH PALMWOODS LOBBY.

00:42.210 --> 00:47.281
- AH, THE FOUR HOCKEY PLAYERS
FROM MINNESOTA.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.350
- I'M NOT GETTING
A FRIENDLY VIBE.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.719
- NO LOITERING
IN THE LOBBY AFTER 9:00.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.288
OH, LOOK AT THE TIME.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.124
9:01.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.226
- THEN THERE'S
THE GRACIOUS INTERIOR

00:58.292 --> 01:01.028
OF OUR VERY OWN APARTMENT 2-J.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.797
[farting sounds]

01:03.864 --> 01:06.200
both: THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.268
crash!

01:07.335 --> 01:11.139
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

01:11.172 --> 01:13.040
- * MAKE IT COUNT,
PLAY IT STRAIGHT *

01:13.141 --> 01:14.808
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:14.875 --> 01:19.046
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME *

01:19.147 --> 01:20.881
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:20.948 --> 01:22.816
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:22.883 --> 01:25.853
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME *

01:25.919 --> 01:26.987
- * OH-OH, OH-OH *

01:27.054 --> 01:28.756
- * HEY, HEY *

01:28.822 --> 01:30.924
- * LISTEN TO YOUR HEART NOW *

01:30.991 --> 01:32.660
- * HEY, HEY *

01:32.726 --> 01:34.828

01:34.895 --> 01:36.464

01:36.530 --> 01:37.798

01:42.803 --> 01:44.172
* GO AND MAKE YOUR LUCK *

01:44.172 --> 01:46.774
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE *

01:46.840 --> 01:50.411
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:50.478 --> 01:55.449
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

01:57.685 --> 01:59.853
[bell dinging]

01:59.920 --> 02:02.190
- WHAT? I'M BUSY.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.891
- WE'D LIKE A NICER APARTMENT,
PLEASE.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.026
- HOW COME EVERY ONE ELSE GETS
ONE OF THOSE COOL APARTMENTS?

02:06.093 --> 02:07.461
- AND OURS IS A BIG-TIME DUMP.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.063
- 2-J, A DUMP?

02:10.198 --> 02:13.066
IF BY "DUMP,"
YOU MEAN "REALLY COOL."

02:14.735 --> 02:18.539
AS YOU KNOW, THE PALMWOODS
IS HOME OF THE FUTURE FAMOUS.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.209
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY SHOWBIZ LEGENDS

02:21.209 --> 02:24.212
HAVE STAYED IN THIS VERY ROOM?

02:24.245 --> 02:26.814
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STAINS
AND SMELLS THERE ARE

02:26.880 --> 02:28.549
IN THIS VERY ROOM?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.818
- IF YOU SPILL, IT'S A STAIN.

02:30.884 --> 02:34.722
WHEN LINDSAY LOHAN
THROWS UP CHOCOLATE MILK,

02:34.788 --> 02:36.524
IT'S HISTORY.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.360
AND THIS SLIGHT BLEMISH,

02:39.427 --> 02:42.996
THE RESULT OF A SHIA LABEOUF
INDOOR SOCCER GAME.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.665
NO SOCCER IN THE ROOMS.

02:44.732 --> 02:49.270
AND ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE TOO GOOD

02:49.337 --> 02:53.241
FOR THE TV
ENJOYED BY KANYE WEST

02:53.274 --> 02:56.744
WHEN HE WAS KNOWN AROUND HERE
AS LIL' KANYE WEST?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.879
- CAN WE AT LEAST
PAINT THE PLACE?

02:58.946 --> 03:01.615
- NO, 'CAUSE YOUR LEASE
SPECIFICALLY STATES

03:01.682 --> 03:05.253
THAT THERE WILL BE
NO PAINTING...

03:05.286 --> 03:08.456
NO HANGING
OF PERSONAL PICTURES--

03:08.522 --> 03:10.458
I'LL ALLOW THIS ONE.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.493
NO CONSTRUCTION OF ANY KIND.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.929
AND THERE IS NO WAY I AM PUTTING
FOUR HOCKEY-PLAYING HOOLIGANS

03:15.996 --> 03:18.666
INTO ONE OF MY FINER APARTMENTS.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.901
- SO INSTALLING
AN INDOOR SWIRLY SLIDE

03:20.968 --> 03:23.136
IS COMPLETELY
OUT OF THE QUESTION?

03:23.271 --> 03:26.440
- THIS MATTER, LIKE THIS DOOR,
IS CLOSED.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.044
- I'M SURPRISED
THE PIPE DIDN'T BURST.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.546
- PIPE JUST BURST.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.981
- YEP.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.716
WE NEED A NEW CRIB.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.352
- YEAH, RIGHT, LIKE THAT'S JUST
GONNA FALL FROM THE SKY.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.355
- WE CALL IT
THE ULTIMATE TEEN CRIB,

03:41.422 --> 03:44.358
FILLED WITH AMAZING HOME
ELECTRONICS, ARCADE GAMES...

03:44.425 --> 03:46.059
- A SWIRLY SLIDE!

03:46.126 --> 03:47.094
ding!

03:47.160 --> 03:48.729
- COOL, RIGHT?

03:48.796 --> 03:51.632
PUT A SWIRLY SLIDE IN MY OFFICE.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.834
- GRIFFIN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS,

03:53.901 --> 03:58.306
BUT I NEED TO WORK WITH THE DOGS
ON HARMONIES TODAY.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.607
- CHANGE YOUR PLANS.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.109
OUR ANCIENT JAPANESE FOUNDER,
MR. FUJIZAKI,

04:02.175 --> 04:04.645
WANTS TO DUMP
OUR MUSIC DIVISION.

04:04.712 --> 04:08.316
BUT YOUR BOYS
ARE GOING TO CHANGE HIS MIND.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.317
- AND WE GET TO LIVE IN THERE?

04:09.383 --> 04:10.884
- YES...

04:10.951 --> 04:13.521
FOR TWO HOURS, WHILE YOU SHOOT
A PROMOTIONAL VIDEO

04:13.587 --> 04:17.057
SURROUNDED BY RCM/CBT/
GLOBAL NET/SANYOID PRODUCTS,

04:17.124 --> 04:19.360
WHICH WILL SHOW FUJIZAKI
WHY OUR FUTURE ROCK STARS

04:19.427 --> 04:21.362
ARE PERFECT
FOR SELLING HIS BLENDERS,

04:21.429 --> 04:24.565
PLASMA TVs,
AND MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.334
OH, AND DO SOME INTERVIEWS.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.602
YOU KNOW, WHY THEY LOVE TO SING,
WHY THEY WEAR THAT HELMET,

04:28.669 --> 04:32.973
AND WHY THEY LOVE RCM/CBT/
GLOBAL NET/SANYOID ARCADE GAMES,

04:33.040 --> 04:35.108
INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH
PLAYGROUND SLIDES,

04:35.175 --> 04:39.112
AND THE NEW XZ5 MICRO LAPTOP.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.348
LOOK HOW TINY.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.949
- AND WE COULD ALL
WEAR BANDANNAS.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.551
IT COULD BE OUR THING.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.354
BANDANNAS.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.590
- GRIFFIN, YOU CAN'T KEEP COMING
INTO MY STUDIO EVERY DAY

04:49.657 --> 04:51.592
AND INTERRUPTING
MY TRAINING SESSIONS.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.060
- YES, I CAN.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.363
AND DO THE INTERVIEWS
BY THE WATER.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.831
FUJIZAKI
THINKS WATER IS LUCKY.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.433
IT'S WEIRD.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.503
- BUT YOU WANT A PERFORMANCE
IN THE TEEN HANGOUT CRIB THING.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.571
- EXACTLY.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.673
AND I NEED IT
IN TWO DAYS,

05:05.739 --> 05:08.909
OR THE MUSIC DIVISION
WILL BE GONE.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.713
BUT HAVE FUN WITH IT.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.649
- OKAY, WE'LL BUILD THE TEENAGE
CRIB HERE IN STUDIO "A."

05:15.716 --> 05:17.685
I'LL FIND A NICE BEACH LOCATION
FOR THE INTERVIEWS

05:17.751 --> 05:19.119
AND PUT IN SOME CALLS
FOR A HOT DIRECTOR.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.421
- I'M A HOT DIRECTOR.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.989
AND WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING HERE,

05:22.055 --> 05:24.525
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER,
QUICKER, AND CHEAPER.

05:24.592 --> 05:28.462
YOU, I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA BUILD THIS THING.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.165
[harp glissando]

05:32.232 --> 05:33.233
[trumpet fanfare]

05:33.300 --> 05:34.468
[farting sound]

05:34.535 --> 05:36.236
- NO.
NO WAY.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.739
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.642
- A WEEK AGO, WE WERE
A HOCKEY TEAM IN MINNESOTA.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.878
AND TODAY
WE'RE A BAND IN L.A.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.079
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.415
- OKAY, YOU HAVE A POINT.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.451
BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET ALL THIS IN HERE?

05:50.518 --> 05:51.952
- TAKE ANY COLOR YOU WANT.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.054
- WE'RE NOT WEARING BANDANNAS
IN THE VIDEO, OKAY?

05:54.121 --> 05:55.423
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:55.489 --> 05:57.525
YOU GUYS NEVER SUPPORT
MY RISKY FASHION CHOICES.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.960
- NOW, THE FIRST STEP
IS GETTING THE SET DESIGNER

06:00.027 --> 06:04.297
TO BUILD THE ULTRATEEN CRIB HERE
AND NOT ROCQUE RECORDS.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.566
- YEAH, THAT'S SIMPLE.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.334
AND HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

06:07.435 --> 06:09.570
- LOGAN, ARE YOU FORGETTING

06:09.637 --> 06:12.573
THAT PALMWOODS IS HOME
OF THE FUTURE FAMOUS?

06:15.443 --> 06:17.445
WAIT FOR IT.

06:17.511 --> 06:21.081
- TREVOR, I TRUSTED YOU
WITH MY HEART,

06:21.148 --> 06:23.183
MY SOUL, MY MONEY.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.018
- CAMILLE.
- WHAT?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.887
all: WE NEED
TO BORROW YOUR ACTING.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.722
- SURE.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.158
I NEED THIS INSTALLED
BY 3:00 P.M. TOMORROW

06:31.224 --> 06:33.193
AT THE PALMWOODS,
NOT ROCQUE RECORDS.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.227
CAN YOU DO IT?

06:34.294 --> 06:35.463
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T,

06:35.529 --> 06:37.798
MR. GRIFFIN
WILL FIND SOMEBODY WHO CAN.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.800
- YEAH, IT'S ALL PRE-BUILT HERE.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.301
AND THE PAINT
WILL BE DRY BY 3:00.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.770
- GOOD.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.605
CALL MR. GRIFFIN
ON THIS NUMBER ONLY

06:44.672 --> 06:45.939
IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS

06:46.006 --> 06:47.908
OR RUN INTO ANY PROBLEMS.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.843
BACK TO WORK, EVERYBODY.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.082
[phone rings]

06:55.148 --> 06:57.050
- ARTHUR GRIFFIN'S OFFICE.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.719
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.921
DO YOUR
GRIFFIN IMPRESSION NOW.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.389

07:02.490 --> 07:04.057
HELLO?

07:04.124 --> 07:06.226
UH-HUH.
YES.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.496
MOVE THAT SET
TO THE PALMWOODS, NOW.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.298
OKAY, I NEED
TO TOUCH MY LLAMA NOW. BYE.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.165
- YES!
- YES!

07:12.232 --> 07:13.701
- I OWNED THEM IN THERE.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.070
- ALL YOU'VE DONE IS SET US UP
FOR BIG-TIME TROUBLE.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.405
- OH, OUR LITTLE LOGEY,

07:18.506 --> 07:19.673
SO PESSIMISTIC.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.509
- SO SCARED OF EVERYTHING.

07:21.509 --> 07:24.512
- AND SO HOT.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.346
- OKAY.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.548
AND I'M NOT SCARED.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.016
I'M REALISTIC,

07:29.082 --> 07:30.417
AS IN, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL YOUR MOM

07:30.518 --> 07:32.285
ABOUT THE CREW THAT'LL BE
INVADING YOUR APARTMENT

07:32.352 --> 07:34.121
TOMORROW FROM 11:00 TO 3:00?

07:34.187 --> 07:35.422
- HEY, I ALMOST FORGOT.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.024
I'M GONNA GO LOOK
FOR A JOB TOMORROW,

07:37.090 --> 07:39.292
SO I'LL BE GONE
FROM ABOUT 11:00 TO 3:00.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.397
- OKAY, THAT HAPPENED,
BUT WHAT NOW?

07:46.033 --> 07:47.868
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.537
FRANKLY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE GOT THIS FAR.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.038
- HEY, LOOK.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.940
WRIST-DANNAS.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.410
- OKAY,
OUR NEXT WORRY IS GUSTAVO.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.313
WE NEED TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO CAN THINK LIKE HIM,

08:00.380 --> 08:03.350
SOMEONE WHO CAN
GET INSIDE HIS HEAD.

08:03.416 --> 08:06.353
WHERE ARE WE GONNA FIND
SOMEONE THAT DEVIOUS?

08:06.419 --> 08:10.023
- FIRST, YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE
FUTURE STARS FROM THE PALMWOODS.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.560
I RECOMMEND THE JENNIFERS
FOR THEIR LACK OF FEAR.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.595
NEXT, YOU'LL NEED
CORDLESS POWER TOOLS,

08:14.662 --> 08:17.565
SAWDUST,
COOL CODE PHRASES, AND--

08:17.565 --> 08:19.567
- WAIT, KATIE.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.934
WHERE DID YOU GET
THE WHITEBOARD?

08:26.306 --> 08:29.309
- [coughing]

08:29.376 --> 08:30.578
- SPEAKING OF BITTERS,

08:30.644 --> 08:33.080
YOU HAVE TO KEEP HIM
IN HIS CAGE ALL DAY.

08:33.146 --> 08:36.283
BUT THE KEY TO THIS WHOLE
ULTRA 2-J MAKEOVER

08:36.349 --> 08:39.820
IS CONVINCING GUSTAVO TO SHOOT
THE INTERVIEWS BY THE POOL

08:39.887 --> 08:41.822
LIKE THAT DOG FOOD COMMERCIAL
LAST NIGHT.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.190
- RIGHT.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.392
AND ONCE OUR TEEN DREAM
REMODELING IS COMPLETE,

08:45.458 --> 08:47.294
HE'LL HAVE NO TIME
AND NO CHOICE

08:47.360 --> 08:50.130
BUT TO SHOOT OUR
ROCK PERFORMANCE RIGHT HERE.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.900
- AND I GET THE FIRST TURN
ON THE SWIRLY SLIDE.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.735
- I GET FIRST TURN
ON THE SWIRLY SLIDE.

08:54.802 --> 08:55.769
- I DO!
- NO, I DO!

08:55.836 --> 08:56.970
- YOU CAN GO TOGETHER.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.743
- LET'S DO THIS.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.477
all: WE'RE NOT WEARING
BANDANNAS.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.046
- BANDANNAS ARE COOL.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.492
- YOU CANNOT
SHOOT AGAINST THIS.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.794
- YES, I CAN.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.263
- FUJIZAKI IS GONNA KNOW
THAT WATER IS FAKE.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.498
FUJIZAKI
IS 200 YEARS OLD.

* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

20:09.442 --> 20:13.580
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME *

20:13.646 --> 20:15.482
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

20:15.548 --> 20:16.683
- WE LOVE HOCKEY.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.551
WE LOVE SINGING.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.753
AND WE HAVE A BLAST TOGETHER.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.160

20:31.598 --> 20:33.700
THAT WAS A ROCK.

20:33.766 --> 20:34.967
- * GO AND SHAKE IT UP *

20:35.034 --> 20:36.469
* WHATCHA GOTTA LOSE *

20:36.536 --> 20:37.704
- I'M THE SMART ONE
OF THE GROUP.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.871
BUT DON'T BE FOOLED.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.673
I'M NOT AFRAID
TO TAKE A RISK,

20:40.740 --> 20:45.011
MUCH LIKE RCM'S 64 BIT CORE
RISC PROCESSOR.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.447

21:00.693 --> 21:03.696

21:03.763 --> 21:05.465
- I'VE NEVER SEEN FUJIZAKI
SO EXCITED.

21:05.532 --> 21:08.935
FRANKLY, I THINK IT'S THE FIRST
TIME I'VE SEEN HIM MOVE.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.771
YOU WERE A GOOD BOY TODAY,
GUSTAVO.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.340
GOOD BOY.

21:19.712 --> 21:24.083

TODAY, DIDN'T WE?

21:24.150 --> 21:25.818
YOU DID SOME THINGS.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.086
WE DID SOME THINGS.

21:27.153 --> 21:30.357
- TEN HOURS OF HARMONIES!

21:30.390 --> 21:32.258
NO BREAKS!

22:03.790 --> 22:06.659
- THIS IS A BONE.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.528
- COME AGAIN?

22:08.595 --> 22:11.898
- I REALIZED TODAY,
SORT OF,

22:11.964 --> 22:15.735
THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO TRAIN DOGS PROPERLY,

22:15.802 --> 22:17.937
YOU NEED TO THROW THEM A TREAT
NOW AND THEN.

22:18.004 --> 22:22.241
SO ENJOY YOUR TREAT.

22:22.308 --> 22:23.710
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY MORE.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.678
- AND WE LOST A DAY OF REHEARSAL
BECAUSE OF THE SHOOT,

22:25.745 --> 22:28.648
SO IT'S AT THE STUDIO,
7:30 A.M.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.016
- WE'LL BE THERE.
NO PROBLEM.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.984
- WE PROMISE,
NO MORE SURPRISES.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.987
[banging]

22:39.959 --> 22:42.429
- YOU'VE ALTERED THIS ROOM.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.632
YOU'VE COMPLETELY DEVASTATED
THIS APARTMENT.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.967
- YOU LOCKED HIM
IN THE SUPPLY CLOSET?

22:48.034 --> 22:48.968
- NO.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.303
BANDANNA MAN DID.

22:51.438 --> 22:54.073
- THIS IS
A TOTAL LEASE VIOLATION.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.742
MAN, COOL SWIRLY SLIDE.

22:55.808 --> 22:59.579
I WANT ALL OF YOU
OUT OF HERE TOMORROW.

22:59.646 --> 23:02.782
- WHAT IF I ADD ANOTHER GRAND
TO YOUR "MAKING IT HAPPEN" FEE?

23:02.849 --> 23:05.251
- HAVE A PALMWOODS DAY,
EVERYONE.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.853
ENJOY YOUR STAY.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.459
- YOU LIKE THEM.

23:12.459 --> 23:15.094
THEY'RE NOT LIKE OTHER BANDS
YOU'VE PRODUCED, ARE THEY?

23:15.161 --> 23:17.296
- THEY'RE DOGS,
AND I'M TRAINING THEM.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.202
I DON'T LIKE THEM!
