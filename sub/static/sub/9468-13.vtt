WEBVTT

00:08.375 --> 00:10.506
And then they posted
all these Facebook

00:10.605 --> 00:13.523
pictures of Ellie Caruso
where she's like

00:13.567 --> 00:15.986
in the background and doesn't
know that there's a camera there

00:16.027 --> 00:18.489
and she's about to shove
this big sandwich in her face,

00:18.530 --> 00:20.657
and it got all these comments
and likes and stuff, and then

00:20.698 --> 00:23.285
she ended up in hospital
for like starving herself

00:23.326 --> 00:26.870
and ripping out
a bunch of her hair.

00:26.913 --> 00:28.498
Girls.

00:28.539 --> 00:30.667
And here I am
talking about them

00:30.707 --> 00:35.213
behind their backs,
and I'm their best friend.

00:35.253 --> 00:38.008
I just... it's like,

00:38.048 --> 00:41.969
high school is coming up so suddenly and
everything has to be a million times more weird

00:42.012 --> 00:44.139
and complicated and sad.
I don't get it.

00:44.179 --> 00:46.682
Look, Hemingway,

00:46.722 --> 00:49.520
girls get to a certain age
and it's sort of like a...

00:49.560 --> 00:53.356
like a freight train
without a conductor.

00:53.398 --> 00:55.692
Every fucked-up thing
that you're feeling right now

00:55.731 --> 00:59.945
pretty much every chick in the universe
has come through it all right--mostly.

01:01.988 --> 01:06.328
I just feel like the more
I try to understand the world,

01:06.370 --> 01:08.664
the more of a stranger
it makes me feel.

01:08.703 --> 01:11.040
I hate it.

01:11.081 --> 01:13.626
I hate not feeling
like other people.

01:13.668 --> 01:16.837
So what?
You'd rather be

01:16.879 --> 01:20.257
normal? You're abnormal
as fucking balls!

01:20.299 --> 01:22.718
What?

01:22.760 --> 01:25.430
I think it's funny
when you say that.

01:25.471 --> 01:27.265
What, balls?

01:29.766 --> 01:31.727
Come on.

01:31.769 --> 01:34.188
Take it from an old man.
OK, this town,

01:34.230 --> 01:36.730
these people, and all this
fucked-up shit that seems

01:36.774 --> 01:39.569
like the end of the known world,
it's all just a blip.

01:42.197 --> 01:44.364
The world outside this place

01:44.408 --> 01:46.367
and the life
that you're gonna live

01:46.409 --> 01:48.495
is so much bigger than this.

01:48.537 --> 01:52.081
You were born for so much more
than you can see here.

01:52.123 --> 01:56.253
And it's just sitting there
waiting for you.

01:58.504 --> 02:01.382
I'd be fucking
jealous of you...

02:01.424 --> 02:04.093
if I weren't me.

Let me out!

03:00.442 --> 03:02.651
Let me out!

03:02.693 --> 03:03.943
Roman!

03:03.985 --> 03:06.615
Come on, you little bitch!
Come on!

03:06.657 --> 03:09.699
Roman, it's fucking locked!

03:14.997 --> 03:17.038
Come on!

03:28.883 --> 03:31.806
Roman!

05:43.312 --> 05:45.314
Shelley.

06:07.377 --> 06:09.923
Roman!

06:12.591 --> 06:14.134
No!

06:23.769 --> 06:25.437
Shelley!

06:25.480 --> 06:28.483
Shelley, don't run! No!

06:30.233 --> 06:32.403
Please don't hurt her.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.036
Shelley!

06:44.749 --> 06:46.750
Shelley!
Shelley!

08:49.624 --> 08:51.581
I'm here.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.586
I'm with you.

09:06.682 --> 09:08.682
Shelley!

09:41.466 --> 09:43.677
Hey.

09:47.264 --> 09:49.264
It's OK.

10:07.701 --> 10:09.701
Tell me.

10:12.288 --> 10:14.291
She's gone.

10:16.918 --> 10:19.089
What do you mean? Where?

10:21.504 --> 10:23.466
The girl--

10:23.509 --> 10:25.469
uh, Christina--

10:25.509 --> 10:27.677
she was the killer.

10:30.932 --> 10:34.311
And what happened to Christina?

10:34.350 --> 10:36.522
Uh, she's dead.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.524
Shelley...

10:42.528 --> 10:45.278
...uh, Shelley saved us.

10:45.322 --> 10:47.700
The sheriff thought she did it.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.033
He shot her and she ran off.

10:52.326 --> 10:54.624
I couldn't find her.

10:59.543 --> 11:02.966
Babies, my babies.

11:12.682 --> 11:14.682
Sleep tight.

11:21.609 --> 11:24.570
And you,

11:24.610 --> 11:27.282
- what about your parents?
- Oh, I'm fine.

11:27.322 --> 11:29.450
- My dad's on his way.
- OK.

11:33.995 --> 11:35.663
I just...

11:35.706 --> 11:37.750
I just, uh...

11:40.461 --> 11:42.211
Come here.

11:46.841 --> 11:49.134
What is it?

11:52.307 --> 11:55.643
I saw him change
into something else.

11:57.812 --> 11:59.855
And then I saw him die,

11:59.897 --> 12:02.899
and then... I woke up

12:02.942 --> 12:06.235
and... he was back--

12:08.572 --> 12:11.075
in my arms.

12:11.115 --> 12:14.076
I don't understand
how any of that can happen.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.705
I don't either.

12:15.745 --> 12:19.956
It was you.
There's no

12:20.000 --> 12:23.504
magic in the world stronger than
life itself, and life is love.

12:23.546 --> 12:27.341
Nothing's stronger.
Nothing ever has been.

12:29.344 --> 12:31.221
Thanks.

12:33.221 --> 12:35.014
Thanks.

12:35.057 --> 12:37.807
<i>While details remain</i>
<i>vague, it appears that</i>

12:37.850 --> 12:40.519
<i>the perpetrator of last night's</i>
<i>Hemlock Grove killing</i>

12:40.562 --> 12:43.066
<i>and those that preceded it</i>
<i>was the disfigured</i>

12:43.105 --> 12:45.985
<i>and mentally ill biotech heiress</i>
<i>Shelley Godfrey.</i>

12:46.027 --> 12:48.278
<i>She was wounded,</i>
<i>perhaps fatally,</i>

12:48.321 --> 12:52.407
<i>by Sheriff Thomas Sworn, but</i>
<i>a body has yet to be recovered.</i>

12:52.447 --> 12:55.119
<i>It is unclear whether there were</i>
<i>other witnesses</i>

12:55.158 --> 12:58.620
- <i>to the in--</i>
- Dad.

12:58.663 --> 13:02.293
He's OK. He's OK.

13:04.879 --> 13:07.254
Your aunt and I have spoken.

13:07.298 --> 13:09.759
The town is gonna need
an explanation,

13:09.798 --> 13:13.596
one that answers more questions
than it raises,

13:13.634 --> 13:15.596
one that protects the ones

13:15.639 --> 13:17.850
who are still here.

13:17.892 --> 13:21.269
Your names won't be part of it.
It's been arranged

13:21.312 --> 13:24.980
with Tom. You were never there.

13:29.903 --> 13:32.572
I guess it's gonna have
to be her, then.

13:32.615 --> 13:35.158
<i>This will be the hardest thing</i>

13:35.201 --> 13:38.413
you ever have to do,

13:38.451 --> 13:42.292
but for the town to heal
and the family to move forward,

13:42.331 --> 13:45.586
- they can never know the truth.
<i>- Peter won't be safe</i>

13:45.628 --> 13:47.546
if they know the truth.

13:47.586 --> 13:50.091
<i>They need a villain.</i>

13:50.133 --> 13:53.466
I will make
all necessary arrangements.

13:53.509 --> 13:55.888
None of you were ever there.

13:55.927 --> 13:59.807
The sheriff acted alone
and he saw what he saw.

13:59.850 --> 14:03.687
It's what she would
have wanted.

14:03.729 --> 14:06.941
She would have wanted
to save what pain she could.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.985
<i>We're Godfreys...</i>

14:11.360 --> 14:15.158
...and what we say happened,
happened.

14:15.197 --> 14:17.408
You sure you can go along
with this?

14:17.451 --> 14:20.330
Is there any other way?

14:23.874 --> 14:25.706
<i>What she wants,</i>

14:25.750 --> 14:29.546
not what she would have wanted.

14:29.586 --> 14:31.841
It's what she wants.

14:31.879 --> 14:34.927
That's why she shouldn't
let me find her.

14:37.221 --> 14:39.182
Yes.

14:39.221 --> 14:42.975
Yes, it's what she wants.

14:43.019 --> 14:47.273
When she returns,
we will protect her

14:47.315 --> 14:49.524
with all our power.

14:49.566 --> 14:51.942
It's what we do.

14:51.985 --> 14:55.239
We protect our own.

14:55.278 --> 14:58.451
This is why
we must do this now.

15:01.576 --> 15:03.788
What about Chasseur?

15:05.791 --> 15:08.793
Oh, don't worry, darling.

15:10.796 --> 15:13.673
I've taken care
of that as well.

15:15.676 --> 15:19.596
She won't be bothering you
or your friend any longer.

15:25.186 --> 15:28.147
All we can do is pray that where she is

15:28.187 --> 15:31.984
she knows the world is better
from the love she put into it,

15:32.024 --> 15:34.860
and the monster that did this,
wherever it is,

15:34.903 --> 15:37.407
will pay for its sins.

15:37.447 --> 15:39.740
Now let's pray and, as we pray,

15:39.783 --> 15:44.495
let's think about Christina-- her
ever present smile and that...

15:44.538 --> 15:47.417
You didn't have to come here.

15:47.456 --> 15:50.086
Appearances.

15:50.125 --> 15:53.879
I'd do anything
to give it back.

15:53.923 --> 15:56.426
What?

15:56.466 --> 15:58.844
Your childhood.

16:01.346 --> 16:04.807
To everything
there is a season.

16:04.850 --> 16:08.229
Ecclesiastes.

16:08.269 --> 16:10.273
The Byrds.

16:13.067 --> 16:16.735
Well, I think
appearances have been made.

16:16.778 --> 16:19.447
Why don't you go and see
how your cousin's doing?

16:19.490 --> 16:21.865
- Thanks.
- ...in the presence

16:21.908 --> 16:25.245
of my enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil;

16:25.288 --> 16:27.998
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:28.038 --> 16:30.125
Surely goodness and mercy

16:30.167 --> 16:32.918
shall follow me
all the days of my life

16:32.961 --> 16:36.715
and I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

16:36.754 --> 16:40.134
I'm so sorry, Tom.

16:40.177 --> 16:43.052
All that you've lost.

16:45.057 --> 16:47.600
It's all so...

16:47.643 --> 16:49.894
fucking pointless.

16:51.897 --> 16:55.274
I did my part.

16:55.317 --> 16:57.860
One bullet
for every one of mine.

16:57.903 --> 17:02.280
Not another man here can
say the same.

17:02.325 --> 17:07.076
These people call me a hero. That abomination
was under my nose the whole time.

17:07.121 --> 17:09.873
Well, the town's safer now.

17:09.913 --> 17:14.295
If I really was a hero, I'd burn that
tower to the ground with Pryce inside.

17:14.336 --> 17:16.086
It's over, Tom.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.923
You think so?

17:19.923 --> 17:22.595
You think that we're living
in a town without evil?

17:24.721 --> 17:28.142
I don't.
And I'm done.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.313
Turned in my badge
this morning.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.440
It's ridiculous to think

17:34.480 --> 17:36.942
that a piece of tin would
make you one of the good guys.

17:36.980 --> 17:38.942
And what's a good guy

17:38.986 --> 17:42.865
when you can't even protect
the things you love the most?

17:44.865 --> 17:47.701
I don't know.

17:47.740 --> 17:50.788
I'm always around

17:50.827 --> 17:54.125
if you want to talk about it.

17:54.164 --> 17:56.125
Yeah, Doctor.

17:56.170 --> 17:59.131
Let's fucking talk about it.

17:59.173 --> 18:01.548
...with thy steadfast love,

18:01.592 --> 18:05.804
that we may rejoice
and be glad all our days.

18:11.519 --> 18:13.479
Wow.

18:13.519 --> 18:15.814
- That was easy.
- Are you a man of faith,

18:15.855 --> 18:19.442
- Mr. Godfrey?
- Brother, neither you or I have

18:19.481 --> 18:22.403
time for me to start
answering that question.

18:22.442 --> 18:26.409
Well, then... a blessed day
to you at any rate.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.451
Yeah, a blessed day to you too.

18:29.491 --> 18:31.913
He's all yours.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.671
Gentlemen.

18:48.510 --> 18:50.471
Strange bedfellows.

18:50.516 --> 18:52.557
So to speak.

18:54.558 --> 18:56.355
Well, here's to

18:56.394 --> 18:59.816
- peace in the kingdom.
- Indeed.

18:59.855 --> 19:05.698
I'm sure you won't mind sharing
the crown with Roman Godfrey.

19:08.365 --> 19:12.162
Twenty years
and that albatross is hanging

19:12.201 --> 19:14.707
around someone else's neck. Ha!

19:14.749 --> 19:16.788
My son's, soon enough.

19:16.833 --> 19:21.422
Well, if he takes after
his father at all...

19:21.461 --> 19:24.337
He's a good kid.

19:24.383 --> 19:27.219
They all are.

19:27.259 --> 19:30.640
Oh, Jesus, the things
they've seen.

19:30.681 --> 19:32.642
They have each other.

19:32.682 --> 19:35.432
We all have each other.

19:35.478 --> 19:38.644
It's all trivial
in the face of this family.

19:38.689 --> 19:42.855
All that matters is family.

19:42.901 --> 19:46.568
Does it make me a bad person to expect
any charitable donation makes me

19:46.614 --> 19:50.490
less guilty for what I'm about
to do to the mother of my child?

19:50.534 --> 19:55.038
It simply makes you a person,
my love.

19:57.082 --> 19:59.585
I can't wait to marry your ass.

19:59.625 --> 20:02.375
You'll have to engage it first.

20:08.173 --> 20:10.554
Hey. How's he doing?

20:10.596 --> 20:12.765
He's out of options,

20:12.807 --> 20:14.682
except for this.

20:14.721 --> 20:16.852
Do you think
it's gonna do any good?

20:16.893 --> 20:19.144
It's no set of lost car keys,

20:19.188 --> 20:21.480
but... stranger things
have happened.

20:28.739 --> 20:32.490
What are you gonna tell
baby girl about... everything?

20:34.576 --> 20:37.873
Is that how it feels
to talk to me?

20:40.125 --> 20:43.500
Oh, don't lose
that backyard baby weight, baby.

20:43.546 --> 20:46.507
- You're a beast.
- You bring it out in me.

20:46.548 --> 20:48.087
I hope so.

20:48.133 --> 20:50.634
- All right, get out of here.
- OK.

20:50.678 --> 20:53.510
See ya.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.928
I know she's there.

21:32.969 --> 21:35.765
♪ In place of any loss ♪

21:35.806 --> 21:38.057
She's somewhere.

21:40.269 --> 21:43.188
She is!

21:43.230 --> 21:46.145
Then continue giving her
your faith.

21:46.191 --> 21:49.192
I'm sure it will comfort her
on her journey.

21:49.236 --> 21:51.488
I'm gonna find her.

21:51.528 --> 21:54.279
She needs me.

21:56.285 --> 21:59.037
You're certain she's the one
who needs you?

22:11.634 --> 22:13.634
Well, I'll be.

22:23.019 --> 22:26.315
Hey.

22:26.355 --> 22:29.777
Hey. Jesus,
that was quick.

22:29.817 --> 22:32.692
- [Uh, guess what I'm doing?]
- Having a baby?

22:32.738 --> 22:34.615
I'm having a baby!

22:34.653 --> 22:36.700
[Yum!]

22:36.740 --> 22:38.740
Well?

22:38.786 --> 22:42.413
Baby... my heart has no words.

22:42.452 --> 22:45.413
Your smile makes the flowers grow,
and your tits make 'em bloom.

22:45.459 --> 22:48.420
I love your ass to pieces and
anything that pops out of you.

22:48.461 --> 22:50.422
[This is the best news
I've heard all year.]

22:50.461 --> 22:53.968
- [I'll see you there, OK?]
- Yeah. I'll catch you on the flipside.

22:54.008 --> 22:55.634
Yeah.

23:16.323 --> 23:19.615
- What's up?
- Birthday.

23:19.660 --> 23:21.286
Yay!

23:21.326 --> 23:23.288
- Oh, shee-it!
- Shee-it!

23:23.326 --> 23:26.249
Give her my best.

23:26.288 --> 23:29.336
- Oh, babies are awesome!
- We should go! - Yes!

23:29.375 --> 23:32.422
What?

23:32.461 --> 23:34.212
Still.

23:34.257 --> 23:37.093
To be the still point

23:37.134 --> 23:39.509
in the turning world is
a warrior's greatest feat.

23:51.191 --> 23:53.151
Anything else?

23:53.192 --> 23:55.612
Go.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.659
Come on.

24:19.970 --> 24:21.971
Nice touch.

24:25.557 --> 24:28.729
Can we... can we
smoke in here?

24:28.769 --> 24:31.565
I'm gonna own the place.
Who's gonna stop us?

25:02.384 --> 25:07.182
<i>Dr. Day, Dr. Day,</i>
<i>please come to the OR.</i>

25:07.221 --> 25:09.478
Uncle Roman.

25:09.519 --> 25:12.815
God help us.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.154
Anything from D?

25:26.411 --> 25:28.413
Dead end.

25:30.913 --> 25:34.164
You completely sure
she's still even out there?

25:34.210 --> 25:37.171
I know she is.

25:37.211 --> 25:40.423
It's like in the fall, you know,
the dreams we were having?

25:40.467 --> 25:43.345
I see her sometimes in dreams.

25:46.846 --> 25:50.019
Not... not in dreams.

25:50.057 --> 25:51.933
I've been trying it on myself.

25:55.691 --> 25:58.692
You...?

25:58.731 --> 26:02.114
<i>I look into the mirror</i>

26:02.153 --> 26:04.115
<i>and I tell myself to see her</i>

26:04.154 --> 26:07.076
<i>and things cloud over,</i>
<i>but there's...</i>

26:07.115 --> 26:09.038
light.

26:09.076 --> 26:11.373
And the light's an angel,

26:11.413 --> 26:14.459
and the angel's her.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.461
It's her.

26:16.500 --> 26:19.631
And she's trying to tell me
something, but... but I can only

26:19.673 --> 26:22.384
just hear her.
What she's saying is...

26:25.054 --> 26:27.635
You must make your heart steel.

26:27.681 --> 26:29.641
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Shelley.</i>

26:32.728 --> 26:35.730
What do you think it means?

26:42.988 --> 26:46.740
I saw a conversion
of his fate line and heart line.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.451
Your friend is gonna face
the hardest choice of his life,

26:49.490 --> 26:52.372
and whoever's in his shadow is
gonna share in the consequences.

26:55.413 --> 26:58.336
Can you make yourself cluck
like a chicken?

27:03.717 --> 27:06.134
I don't know.

27:06.178 --> 27:08.680
In the chapel,

27:08.721 --> 27:12.307
you know, when you did
what you did...

27:15.144 --> 27:17.313
...how were you not afraid?

27:24.653 --> 27:26.403
What?

27:26.448 --> 27:29.490
I've never been more afraid
of anything in my life.

27:32.451 --> 27:36.038
I could have never done it if
I hadn't had you there with me.

27:43.173 --> 27:44.923
Yeah.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.718
Fucking angels.

27:50.055 --> 27:52.141
It's OK, sweetie. It's OK.

27:52.182 --> 27:54.893
- It's OK.
- You're doing great.

28:02.355 --> 28:04.278
Doctor!

28:04.317 --> 28:07.614
Please, I don't...
I don't want it. Please!

28:07.653 --> 28:10.740
Please, please!

28:14.663 --> 28:19.038
- Stay still!
- Please! Ah! Ah!

28:19.084 --> 28:21.295
Come on!

28:26.587 --> 28:28.384
Peter?

28:30.804 --> 28:32.806
Hey, what's going on?

28:38.352 --> 28:40.939
<i>Code omega.</i>

28:40.980 --> 28:43.900
<i>Code omega. Maternity one.</i>

28:43.942 --> 28:46.236
<i>All available staff report.</i>

28:59.788 --> 29:03.211
Sir, uh, there's a disruption
in the OR.

29:03.250 --> 29:06.381
It doesn't matter.

29:06.422 --> 29:09.218
Sir?

29:09.259 --> 29:12.846
Just... tell him
where to find me.

29:32.448 --> 29:35.451
<i>Maternity one.</i>
<i>Cancel omega.</i>

29:35.490 --> 29:39.663
<i>Patient is deceased.</i>
<i>Security, clear the area.</i>

30:08.106 --> 30:10.486
I thought she'd be safe,

30:10.528 --> 30:13.198
safe with you.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.865
It was...

30:14.904 --> 30:17.076
unavoidable.

30:19.491 --> 30:21.413
Do it.

30:21.452 --> 30:23.083
Bring her back.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.460
Norman... perhaps
you should sit down.

30:25.500 --> 30:28.422
No, no. You need
to bring her back.

30:28.461 --> 30:30.923
I'm ordering you
to bring her back!

30:30.962 --> 30:34.219
She suffered a massive
post-partum embolism.

30:34.259 --> 30:35.929
I'm sorry,

30:35.971 --> 30:37.635
but...

30:37.680 --> 30:40.346
She's getting cold.

30:40.392 --> 30:43.478
Look, just bring her back.

30:43.519 --> 30:46.519
You think I'm being irrational.

30:48.520 --> 30:50.106
Oh, but I'm not.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.737
Look, I'm in full possession
of my faculties.

30:52.778 --> 30:55.115
Just... bring her back.

30:55.153 --> 30:59.240
I'll make you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

30:59.286 --> 31:01.788
Norman, give her to me.

31:01.826 --> 31:05.663
- You'll do it?
- Go on,

31:05.708 --> 31:08.211
- give her to me.
- You'll do it now?

31:13.548 --> 31:15.548
Take her back.

31:23.977 --> 31:25.979
No.

31:39.659 --> 31:41.661
She's too old.

31:44.998 --> 31:47.334
I may have more luck
with the baby.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.875
Fuck the baby.

31:49.919 --> 31:51.921
SHE'S my baby.

32:12.025 --> 32:14.986
I'm sorry, Norman.

32:15.028 --> 32:17.028
I'm not God.

32:26.622 --> 32:29.125
<i>Are you ready?</i>

32:38.259 --> 32:41.221
- No.
- Yeah.

32:41.259 --> 32:43.056
You know...

32:45.471 --> 32:48.019
...when I was pregnant
with you,

32:48.057 --> 32:50.564
Nic had a vision

32:50.605 --> 32:53.567
that he was holding a baby

32:53.605 --> 32:56.236
and the baby was peeing on him

32:56.278 --> 33:00.403
and the pee was coming out as one
red silk ribbon after the other.

33:00.449 --> 33:05.326
And that's how he knew you were
gonna have a long and full life.

33:05.366 --> 33:10.833
And it filled him up
with so much sadness,

33:10.875 --> 33:13.669
because in a life that's long
and well lived, there's gonna be

33:13.711 --> 33:16.256
pain and darkness
that can't be understood

33:16.298 --> 33:19.173
by those who live day to day
like it's any other.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.634
You loved her, she loved you,

33:23.679 --> 33:28.307
and you're never gonna be
the same again.

33:30.308 --> 33:32.939
And these are all good things.

34:48.389 --> 34:51.643
Darling, tell me

34:51.684 --> 34:54.311
what you need.

34:57.065 --> 34:58.940
Peter.

35:37.021 --> 35:40.483
<i>You know this story.</i>

35:40.525 --> 35:45.320
<i>Many years ago in a land</i>
<i>beyond the forest...</i>

35:45.362 --> 35:47.657
<i>there lived a young girl,</i>

35:47.699 --> 35:50.826
<i>the plainer of two sisters</i>

35:50.867 --> 35:54.623
<i>and daughter of one of</i>
<i>the proudest names in the land.</i>

35:54.664 --> 35:59.210
<i>She was much loved and protected</i>
<i>by her father and elder sister</i>

35:59.251 --> 36:02.588
<i>for her meek and gentle spirit.</i>

36:04.590 --> 36:10.137
<i>But in her 13th year she was</i>
<i>to have a taste of the suffering</i>

36:10.179 --> 36:12.556
<i>from which she had long</i>
<i>been shielded.</i>

36:12.599 --> 36:16.811
<i>His name was Dimitri</i>

36:16.851 --> 36:19.813
<i>and he was a slave purchased</i>

36:19.855 --> 36:23.233
<i>for the unthinkable sum</i>
<i>of two oxen</i>

36:23.275 --> 36:25.902
<i>for her sister's dowry.</i>

36:25.945 --> 36:29.657
<i>So she did the unthinkable.</i>

36:29.699 --> 36:34.077
<i>She defied the law of her land</i>
<i>and her blood</i>

36:34.119 --> 36:37.039
<i>and she stole him.</i>

36:39.793 --> 36:42.920
<i>They rode a day and a night</i>

36:42.960 --> 36:46.257
<i>until they dared sleep without</i>
<i>a search party catching up.</i>

37:22.918 --> 37:25.295
<i>But when she awoke,</i>

37:25.338 --> 37:27.047
<i>Dimitri,</i>

37:27.088 --> 37:30.425
<i>both horses, and the rings</i>
<i>on her fingers</i>

37:30.467 --> 37:32.344
<i>were gone.</i>

38:29.443 --> 38:32.447
<i>A search party came across her</i>
<i>the next day.</i>

38:35.617 --> 38:38.159
<i>Nine months passed.</i>

38:41.456 --> 38:43.833
Not to worry,
my darling Olivia.

38:43.875 --> 38:46.251
We'll say she is your sister's,

38:46.293 --> 38:49.838
and it will be a dishonor
to no one.

38:49.880 --> 38:54.217
The blood of a slave...

38:57.012 --> 39:00.766
...makes a slave.

39:00.809 --> 39:04.813
Give it to the swineherd.

39:04.853 --> 39:09.900
<i>And so the child, Magdalena,</i>
<i>was not heard from again.</i>

39:12.193 --> 39:14.155
<i>And Olivia informed her father</i>

39:14.195 --> 39:16.614
<i>she'd be going to the academy</i>
<i>in the city</i>

39:16.657 --> 39:19.284
<i>to learn the dramatic arts.</i>

39:22.163 --> 39:27.626
<i>A gypsy is a gypsy is a gypsy.</i>

39:27.668 --> 39:31.505
<i>They will steal the rings</i>
<i>from your fingers</i>

39:31.547 --> 39:35.467
<i>and the love from your heart.</i>

39:35.510 --> 39:40.431
<i>But as he discovered history's truest
and cruelest nature...</i>

39:40.472 --> 39:43.643
<i>...to repeat,</i>

39:43.684 --> 39:45.643
<i>I was there waiting for him.</i>

39:45.686 --> 39:47.563
<i>I was right there.</i>

41:30.164 --> 41:31.793
Mmm.

41:36.170 --> 41:39.759

45:47.172 --> 45:49.507
No! No! No!

45:49.550 --> 45:52.427
No! No! No! No!

45:52.469 --> 45:56.139
- No!
- You can't control the hunger.

46:00.061 --> 46:02.021
Let it take you.

46:02.063 --> 46:04.106
No!

46:09.110 --> 46:12.447
You must make your heart steel.
You must make your heart steel.

46:12.489 --> 46:15.076
You must make your heart steel.

46:15.117 --> 46:17.369
You must make your heart steel.

46:17.452 --> 46:21.206
- You must make your heart steel.
- Clever boy.

47:03.831 --> 47:06.458
You are a warrior.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.885
You don't win.

47:48.460 --> 47:52.130
Oh, my poor boy.

47:52.172 --> 47:54.382
I love you so much.

Oh, darling,

I always win.

50:45.554 --> 50:49.681
You're not a warrior.

50:49.724 --> 50:52.353
You are a dragon.

50:57.148 --> 50:59.108
Do it.

51:06.367 --> 51:09.286
Ah!

51:24.385 --> 51:28.972
So... proud of you.

51:50.784 --> 51:53.163
Oh...

51:53.204 --> 51:55.623
You talk too much.

Your Grace?

53:32.094 --> 53:35.349
I think you're gonna like it.

Sudoku

53:41.271 --> 53:44.692
keeps the mind spry.

53:44.733 --> 53:48.235
You'll find that's no small
thing when you reach my age.

53:48.277 --> 53:52.324
But then I suppose it's
impossible for a man of your age

53:52.364 --> 53:55.409
to believe it will
ever come to pass.

53:55.452 --> 53:59.581
Speak in straight lines,
papist. Why am I here?

53:59.623 --> 54:02.710
Why am I here?

54:02.751 --> 54:04.710
Are we debating ontology?

54:04.753 --> 54:08.047
Don't contact me again.

54:08.088 --> 54:11.467
Michael Chasseur.

54:16.556 --> 54:19.309
- I have a job for you.
- Keep it.

54:19.351 --> 54:22.103
I don't need the silver
from you.

54:22.143 --> 54:24.606
Who said anything about money?

54:24.648 --> 54:28.860
It's not that kind of job.

54:35.242 --> 54:38.746
Hemlock Grove.

54:38.786 --> 54:41.331
It was him,

54:41.373 --> 54:43.666
Roman Godfrey...

54:45.668 --> 54:48.588
...who murdered
your sister.

54:50.590 --> 54:52.592
Mmm. Yummy.

55:20.077 --> 55:22.954
Well!

55:22.996 --> 55:25.500
I suppose we can find room.

55:36.637 --> 55:38.221
You hungry?

55:40.222 --> 55:42.809
Not right now.

55:42.851 --> 55:44.853
Maybe later.
