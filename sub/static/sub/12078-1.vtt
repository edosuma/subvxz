- Oh.
- Yeah. But...

I say screw it.

09:10.576 --> 09:12.377
We go ahead without the permit.

09:12.378 --> 09:14.112
Yeah, but what if we get caught?

09:14.113 --> 09:16.449
I mean, wouldn't we have to
tear it all out and redo it?

09:16.450 --> 09:18.284
It would cost like twice as much.

09:18.285 --> 09:21.853
I'm sure we could avoid getting caught.

11:40.126 --> 11:42.026

think about putting in

11:44.564 --> 11:47.232

13:49.288 --> 13:50.721
I was gonna ask you about that shirt,

13:50.722 --> 13:52.658
- but it says "Leonard" on it.
- That's my name, Doc.

13:52.659 --> 13:56.127
Lincoln's just a nickname my
teammates gave me in college.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.728
- Basketball teammates?
- Yep.

13:57.729 --> 13:59.765
They used to call me "Link"

13:59.766 --> 14:02.300
because, uh, when I joined the squad,

14:02.301 --> 14:05.771
fellas said they no longer had
a weak link in the lineup.

14:05.772 --> 14:08.574
Then that became "Lincoln,"

14:08.575 --> 14:11.642
because I led 'em out of the
slavery of a third place team.

14:11.643 --> 14:15.280
I guess it doesn't surprise me
you were such a stud in college.

14:15.281 --> 14:17.249
- Yeah?
- When we first started playing together,

14:17.250 --> 14:20.352
- before you got old and slow.
- Oh, damn, man. [Laughs]

14:20.353 --> 14:24.189
I, uh, I thought you played well
enough to have been pro.

14:24.190 --> 14:26.724
I almost did, Doc, but it wasn't in the cards.

14:26.725 --> 14:28.327
Huh. Why not?

14:28.328 --> 14:29.229
Well, I'll tell you the story
if you want to hear it.

- All right.

14:32.565 --> 14:34.732

14:34.733 --> 14:36.503

14:37.503 --> 14:39.271

I mean, real good.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.343
We had, uh, just won the big game.

14:44.344 --> 14:46.578
- Clinched our conference.
- Wow.

14:46.579 --> 14:49.714
And, uh... damn.

14:49.715 --> 14:52.416

14:59.425 --> 15:00.792
That's it.
His career's over.

15:00.793 --> 15:02.327
It's like over

15:02.328 --> 15:05.597
and like right, right
when he would turn pro, too.

15:05.598 --> 15:08.534
It's, it's, it's like a crusher.

15:08.535 --> 15:11.670
He's always got these pieces
of gauze taped to his arm.

15:11.671 --> 15:14.740
Turns out the poor guy's got kidney failure.

15:14.741 --> 15:16.208
[toilet flushes]

15:16.209 --> 15:18.443
Jesus.

15:18.444 --> 15:21.646
It's amazing how you can know
someone for so long,

15:21.647 --> 15:24.782
but you never really know 'em.

15:24.783 --> 15:26.217
Wow.

15:26.219 --> 15:27.452
[spits]

15:27.453 --> 15:31.323
He's got these terrible, cracked teeth.

15:31.324 --> 15:34.325
I was thinking about paying
for him to go to the dentist,

15:34.326 --> 15:37.663
but I don't know.

15:37.664 --> 15:41.300
Well, you know, if his passion's
really basketball...

15:41.301 --> 15:42.734
- Mmm. [Spits]
- ...you should talk to Ron's sister

15:42.735 --> 15:44.269
about that school she runs.

15:44.270 --> 15:46.275
Maybe they have a coaching job open.

15:49.275 --> 15:51.845
That's not a bad idea.

15:53.845 --> 15:55.217
[knocking]

15:57.217 --> 15:58.282
Hi.

15:58.283 --> 15:59.885
Sorry to bother you,
Dr. Lang,

15:59.886 --> 16:03.789
but when your guys broke
through your wall the other day

16:03.790 --> 16:05.724
a bunch of dust got into my house.

16:05.725 --> 16:07.228
Oh. I'm really sorry
about that.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.660
[dog whines]

16:09.661 --> 16:11.329
I also, I, I noticed that you're

16:11.330 --> 16:12.965
expanding your front room towards our house.

16:12.966 --> 16:15.601
- Right.
- I looked it up for me on the internet.

16:15.602 --> 16:18.640
The code is to leave a five foot passage.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.574
[dog growls]

16:22.575 --> 16:23.976
What can I do?

16:23.977 --> 16:26.011
You can't see it anymore because I spent hours

16:26.012 --> 16:28.880
cleaning everything with
white vinegar and a toothbrush.

16:28.881 --> 16:33.352
[chuckles]
But you can see it on the TV here.

16:33.353 --> 16:35.454
Oh.

16:35.455 --> 16:38.022
Wow, well, I can have the guys
working on my project

16:38.023 --> 16:39.591
come by and clean up for you.

16:39.592 --> 16:43.661
I hardly think that a, a laborer

16:43.662 --> 16:45.430
who hammers and saws all day would know

16:45.431 --> 16:46.897
how to clean my house.

16:46.898 --> 16:48.868
Yeah, you might be right about that.

16:48.869 --> 16:50.901
And this has been very, very hard on me.

16:50.902 --> 16:54.039
I mean, with all this dust just,
it's just floating around.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.275
Just look!
It's everywhere! See?

16:56.276 --> 16:59.580
It's everywhere!
Here, you see it?

17:00.580 --> 17:01.746
I mean, you're a doctor.

17:01.747 --> 17:03.447
You've heard of environmental illnesses.

17:03.448 --> 17:05.852
- Sure, I've heard of 'em.
- That's, that's why I keep this

17:05.853 --> 17:08.654
basil leaf pinned to my lapel.
It purifies the air.

17:08.655 --> 17:11.957
[inhales deeply]
My naprapath suggested it.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.758
It's been a lifesaver.

17:13.759 --> 17:16.661
Well, I'm very happy to pay for
a professional cleaning service

17:16.662 --> 17:18.330
if you need it.
Whatever the cost.

17:18.332 --> 17:20.431
You give me the bill, I'll write the check.

17:20.432 --> 17:22.402
I just want you to be happy.

17:23.402 --> 17:25.002
That's very nice of you.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.506
Not at all.

17:27.507 --> 17:29.441
All right, I should get goin', so...

17:29.442 --> 17:30.941
- Dr. Lang?
- Yeah?

17:30.942 --> 17:32.842
I heard you last night...
[chuckles]

17:32.843 --> 17:34.814
...try to scare away
your raccoons.

17:34.815 --> 17:37.048
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

17:37.049 --> 17:38.683
[chuckling]
That's OK.

17:38.684 --> 17:39.986
I don't sleep much anyway.

17:39.987 --> 17:42.520
- You don't sleep?
- No.

17:42.521 --> 17:45.459
I get a little every few weeks, but...

17:46.459 --> 17:48.327
...basically
I'm a night creature.

17:48.328 --> 17:49.660
Huh.

17:49.661 --> 17:52.430
Well, I could get you some samples of Ambien

17:52.431 --> 17:53.932
from the office.
It might help with that.

17:53.933 --> 17:55.433
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:55.434 --> 17:56.634
You know what?

17:56.635 --> 17:58.104
I'll drop 'em in your mailbox

17:58.105 --> 17:59.679
when I get home from work.

18:06.679 --> 18:09.526
[whistling]

18:20.526 --> 18:23.862
[grunts and groans]
Nealy!

18:23.863 --> 18:25.863
Wow, this stuff is burning the skin of my hand

18:25.864 --> 18:27.669
just touching it!

18:29.669 --> 18:31.469
[groans]

18:31.470 --> 18:33.104
- [sighs]
- I doubt a raccoon

18:33.105 --> 18:34.672
is gonna come back here

18:34.673 --> 18:37.808
after he snorts up a nose full of this.

18:37.809 --> 18:40.112
[exhales]

18:40.113 --> 18:45.953
So... I read online today
about this guy...

18:47.953 --> 18:51.156
...he sticks a barrel
into his grass

18:51.157 --> 18:53.958
and he throws steaks in, and during the night,

18:53.959 --> 18:55.861
the raccoons, they jump in,

18:55.862 --> 18:57.795
but they can't climb out.

18:57.796 --> 19:01.565
He runs a hose from his garage out
of the tailpipe from his car,

19:01.566 --> 19:06.571
he sticks a lid on and asphyxiates them.

19:06.572 --> 19:08.975
You know, I really don't feel
like talking about this

19:08.976 --> 19:10.978
five nights a week.

19:11.978 --> 19:13.978
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bore you.

19:13.979 --> 19:16.948
We should re-landscape
without sod,

19:16.949 --> 19:18.483
like I keep telling you.

19:18.484 --> 19:21.452
You know, fifteen hundred square feet of grass

19:21.453 --> 19:24.456
and a new irrigation system was expensive.

19:24.457 --> 19:26.024
You just don't throw it away.

19:26.025 --> 19:27.527
Please don't use that tone with me.

19:27.528 --> 19:29.527
I didn't use any tone with you.

19:29.528 --> 19:32.163
OK, don't deny using a tone when you use a tone.

19:32.164 --> 19:34.466
I'm not crazy, I know what I just heard.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.168
I didn't call you crazy.

19:36.169 --> 19:38.603
But you implied it, though, didn't you?

19:38.604 --> 19:41.071
As if I'm not sane enough
to judge your tone of voice.

19:41.072 --> 19:42.941
- Maybe you are crazy.
- Oh, oh, right.

19:42.942 --> 19:45.677
Oh, oh, now the truth comes out.

19:45.678 --> 19:48.612
- Well, you want to know the truth?
- Yeah, sure, I love the truth.

19:48.613 --> 19:50.515
OK. The truth is,
you are the crazy one, OK?

19:50.516 --> 19:52.184
- Right, yes, of course I am. Yeah.
- With these goddamn raccoons,

19:52.185 --> 19:55.454
you are acting like a complete
fucking deranged moron.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.956
Now I'm acting like a fucking deranged moron?

19:57.957 --> 20:00.092
- Keep your fucking voice down.
- You keep your fuckin' voice down.

20:00.093 --> 20:02.127
Don't you dare wake up Miles.

20:02.128 --> 20:04.161
This is it! This is perfect!

20:04.162 --> 20:05.996
This is just what you want, isn't it?

20:05.997 --> 20:08.232
- What is what I want?
- You want me to get crazy

20:08.233 --> 20:10.633
- so you can remind me of how crazy I get...
- Oh, mission accomplished!

20:10.634 --> 20:12.503
...when you make me
apologize to you!

20:12.504 --> 20:14.172
You're crazy with your
fucking Indian pepper bullshit!

20:14.173 --> 20:16.675
Hey! I'm working on our
fucking lawn for our son!

20:16.676 --> 20:19.544
- What?
- But of course I'm the crazy one!

20:19.545 --> 20:21.512
And of course you have no fucking responsibility

20:21.513 --> 20:22.614
- at all in this fight!
- You know what,

20:22.615 --> 20:24.649
just go fuck one of your raccoons!

20:24.650 --> 20:27.255
More likely than fucking you!

20:29.255 --> 20:32.293
- [raccoons chittering]
- [wind chimes chiming]

21:07.293 --> 21:09.302
[sniffs]

21:16.302 --> 21:18.940
[rooster crows]

21:21.940 --> 21:24.543
Hi, Jeffrey.
Fancy meeting you here.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.710
Uh, here's for your cleaning service.

21:26.711 --> 21:28.546
- [timer ringing]
- Thank you.

21:28.547 --> 21:30.215
Oh, your timing's impeccable.

21:30.216 --> 21:31.849
I have a surprise for you, come on in.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.218
I'd love to come in, but I've gotta get to work.

21:33.219 --> 21:36.086
Come on in.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.327
I won't bite.

21:42.327 --> 21:44.728
Now just wait here, just a sec.

21:44.729 --> 21:45.863
OK.

21:45.864 --> 21:48.999
I found these really great blueberries

21:49.000 --> 21:50.803
at the farmer's market the other day

21:50.804 --> 21:54.706
and it inspired me to do some baking.

21:54.707 --> 21:56.975
So...

21:56.976 --> 21:58.576
I hope you like pies.

21:58.577 --> 21:59.810
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

21:59.811 --> 22:01.346
Well, the blueberries were so beautiful,

22:01.347 --> 22:02.913
I had to do something with them.

22:02.914 --> 22:04.649
Did you know they're a superfood?

22:04.650 --> 22:05.817
And, and the crust
is gluten-free

22:05.818 --> 22:07.919
which means I didn't use flour.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.322
I used spelt.

22:10.323 --> 22:12.090
By the way...

22:12.091 --> 22:14.825
[sighs]
...I'm sleeping so much better,

22:14.826 --> 22:17.027
thanks to your magic little pills.

22:17.028 --> 22:18.630
Oh, that's good to hear.

22:18.631 --> 22:20.197
- [chuckles]
- [cell phone ringing]

22:20.198 --> 22:21.998
And Jeff, you haven't seen my Matthew

22:21.999 --> 22:23.702
wandering around the neighborhood, have you?

22:23.703 --> 22:25.103
- Uh...
- My cat.

22:25.104 --> 22:27.872
- Your cat?
- He didn't come home last night,

22:27.873 --> 22:30.307
but you know how cats are, nine lives and all.

22:30.308 --> 22:33.844
Actually, I was thinking about
buying a miniature camera

22:33.845 --> 22:35.014
and attaching it to his collar

22:35.015 --> 22:37.047
to see where he skulks around to.

22:37.048 --> 22:41.785
- Oh, that's, uh, an idea.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

22:41.786 --> 22:43.700
Thank you.

22:54.700 --> 22:58.268
<i>[woman] Hey, babe.
Thanks for writing.</i>

22:58.269 --> 22:59.904
<i>I really would love to get
together with you</i>

22:59.905 --> 23:03.240
<i>one of these days
for a, uh, a rubdown.</i>

23:03.241 --> 23:06.010
<i>[chuckles]
Hope to see you soon.</i>

23:06.011 --> 23:08.313
<i>And if we do get together,</i>

23:08.314 --> 23:10.817
<i>don't forget
to bring your friend...</i>

23:12.817 --> 23:13.873
<i>...Mary Jane.</i>

23:33.873 --> 23:35.774
[chuckles]

23:35.775 --> 23:37.043
You're sweating.

23:37.044 --> 23:38.410
Well, I walked here.

23:38.411 --> 23:40.945
I tried to get here as fast as I could.

23:40.946 --> 23:43.381
Is everything all right?
What's goin' on?

23:43.382 --> 23:47.384
Yeah, just needed to talk
to a friend and have a drink.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.787
- You want one?
- Of course.

23:49.788 --> 23:53.057
Have I ever said no to that
question after twelve?

23:53.058 --> 23:55.363
So what are we talkin' about here?

23:57.363 --> 23:59.234
We are talking about...

24:02.234 --> 24:03.968
...infidelity.

24:03.969 --> 24:07.337
- [chuckles]
- I believe you have some experience with that.

24:07.338 --> 24:09.708
Uh, yes, I do.

24:09.709 --> 24:14.411
Uh, is Mister Virgin Mary being unfaithful?

24:14.412 --> 24:16.147
[chuckles]
No.

24:16.148 --> 24:19.750
Not unfaithful. [Lnhales]

24:19.751 --> 24:21.986
- Not technically.
- Oh. [Chuckles]

24:21.987 --> 24:26.091
But I have been emailing with
girls on the internet.

24:26.092 --> 24:27.859
Girls on the internet.

24:27.860 --> 24:32.096
OK, what, what kind of girls on the internet?

24:32.097 --> 24:35.432
Sensual massage therapists.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.170
Oh, you mean whores?

24:38.170 --> 24:39.200
I guess.

24:39.205 --> 24:41.872
OK, well, I think

24:41.873 --> 24:44.374
that sleeping with a prostitute

24:44.375 --> 24:46.945
"technically" counts as being unfaithful.

24:46.946 --> 24:49.447
No, no, I am not sleeping
with them, that's the point.

24:49.448 --> 24:52.116
I just get off on flirting with them online.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.185
I don't go through with it.

24:54.186 --> 24:56.454
Though truthfully,

24:56.455 --> 24:59.027
I do think about it.

25:03.027 --> 25:05.231
When was the last time you and Nealy had sex?

25:06.231 --> 25:08.399
[chuckles]

25:08.400 --> 25:09.600
Oh, uh...

25:09.601 --> 25:11.869
- <i>...it was make-up sex.</i>
- <i>[Rebecca] Really?</i>

25:11.870 --> 25:13.169
- <i>[Jeff] Yeah.</i>
- <i>[Rebecca laughs]</i>

25:13.170 --> 25:14.774
<i>[Jeff]</i>
<i>Do you wanna hear about it?</i>

25:14.775 --> 25:17.007
- <i>[Rebecca] Yes, of course.</i>
- <i>[Jeff] OK.</i>

25:17.008 --> 25:19.544
<i>Uh, well, I was fuckin' around online,</i>

25:19.545 --> 25:22.247
you know, looking up porn,
checking out my internet chicks,

25:22.248 --> 25:24.548
- <i>my net whores. [Laughs]</i>
- <i>[laughs]</i>

25:24.549 --> 25:27.384
- <i>Oh, God, I never learn.</i>
- <i>No, you don't. [Laughs]</i>

25:27.385 --> 25:28.418
<i>[Jeff]</i>
<i>All right, all right.</i>

25:28.419 --> 25:29.419
<i>Anyway, a few hours later,</i>

25:29.420 --> 25:30.888
<i>I get a call from Nealy.</i>

25:30.889 --> 25:32.557
- <i>She's read all my emails.</i>
- <i>No!</i>

25:32.558 --> 25:35.493
<i>[Jeff]</i>
<i>Yeah. Suffice to say, she is not too pleased.</i>

25:35.494 --> 25:38.463
<i>[Rebecca groans]</i>
- <i>Of course, I can't leave to go talk to her in person.</i>

25:38.464 --> 25:41.533
<i>My patient's labor's going on
all night, so the next morning,</i>

25:41.534 --> 25:43.499
<i>I have some flowers
delivered to her store</i>

25:43.500 --> 25:45.302
- <i>with a very cheesy love poem.</i>
- <i>[laughs]</i>

25:45.303 --> 25:47.504
<i>But when I finally get home,
she's still at her shop,</i>

25:47.505 --> 25:49.475
<i>so I go for a run to clear my head</i>

40:25.049 --> 40:29.920
Ohh... no.

40:29.921 --> 40:32.456
He was so wonderful.

40:32.457 --> 40:36.468

All he wanted to do was play.

40:43.468 --> 40:45.480

There you go.

41:09.493 --> 41:11.028
Jeffrey?

41:11.029 --> 41:13.430
Do you know Sonya Fitzpatrick?

41:13.431 --> 41:16.867
- No.
- She's a pet medium on TV,

41:16.868 --> 41:19.135
but she has a private practice.

41:19.136 --> 41:22.338
And when my first Yorkie, Max, died,

41:22.339 --> 41:25.742
she gave me a lot of comfort.
So...

41:25.743 --> 41:27.910
so when...

41:27.911 --> 41:30.146
...when I finally

41:30.147 --> 41:33.182
found Matthew's body...

41:33.183 --> 41:36.920

...wedged like,

41:42.426 --> 41:44.230
I called her, and do you know what she said?

41:45.230 --> 41:46.764
What?

41:46.765 --> 41:49.432
As he was dying...

41:49.433 --> 41:54.172
...in excruciating pain...

41:55.172 --> 41:57.843
...he was
wondering where I was.

41:59.843 --> 42:01.478
Well, he's, he's at peace now.

42:01.479 --> 42:04.819
[sniffs]
Maybe.

42:07.819 --> 42:12.562
Maybe he's lost in the dark
swirling abyss of nothingness.

42:17.562 --> 42:21.331
[inhales]
I'm sorry.

42:21.332 --> 42:25.034
I'm really, really sorry, Lila.

42:25.035 --> 42:26.935
Of course you are.
Of course you're sorry.

42:26.936 --> 42:29.410
Because you poisoned him
trying to kill your raccoons.

42:32.410 --> 42:35.012
<i>It's OK.</i>

42:35.013 --> 42:38.414
I know you weren't trying to hurt him.

42:38.415 --> 42:41.485
You were trying to make it...

42:41.486 --> 42:43.954
[sniffs]
...nice and pretty

42:43.955 --> 42:46.055
for your family in the backyard.

42:47.826 --> 42:51.028
I bet Mrs. Nealy Lang was...

42:51.029 --> 42:54.298
I bet she was really upset
that her sod was all messed up.

42:54.299 --> 42:55.268
[sniffs]
I bet...

42:57.268 --> 43:00.003
I bet she put a lot of pressure on you...

...to fix it.

I am sorry for your loss,

43:40.143 --> 43:43.246

43:49.319 --> 43:51.954
You forgot to mention that I disgust you.

43:51.955 --> 43:54.324
No.

43:54.325 --> 43:55.492
No...

43:55.493 --> 43:57.059
Oh, don't lie to me, just say it.

43:57.060 --> 44:00.630
- That's not it.
- Oh, "married man"?

44:00.631 --> 44:03.201
"Married man"? Please.

You're a dirty philanderer.

You're stupid, too.

44:09.274 --> 44:12.508
What, you're just leaving clues
around for somebody to find.

44:12.509 --> 44:14.010
Careless!

44:14.011 --> 44:16.345
Do you want to be caught?

44:16.346 --> 44:19.548
- [exhales]
- [quietly] Maybe you should.

44:19.549 --> 44:21.418
Maybe you should get caught.

44:21.419 --> 44:23.954
Maybe I should go out on the street

44:23.955 --> 44:26.088
and I should scream it for the world to hear

44:26.089 --> 44:31.093
that Dr. Jeffrey Lang is a
cheating, cat-killing liar!

44:31.094 --> 44:34.264
You know, it's against the law

44:34.265 --> 44:36.566
to kill wildlife in this state!

...power hammers
in the middle of the night.

45:05.530 --> 45:08.365
We didn't do any construction
in the middle of the night.

45:08.366 --> 45:09.733
Well, how would I know

45:09.734 --> 45:13.442
when you gave me those bizarre
pills that doped me?

45:17.442 --> 45:20.093
Excuse me.

45:36.093 --> 45:38.095
I'm sorry.

45:38.096 --> 45:40.197
I'm sorry.

45:40.198 --> 45:41.200
I didn't mean to shout at you.

[exhales]

45:44.301 --> 45:45.203
I just...

45:46.203 --> 45:49.472
I'm very upset about Matthew.

45:49.473 --> 45:51.377
Of course you are.

45:53.377 --> 45:55.278
The main thing is...

45:55.279 --> 45:57.014
I wanna somehow find a way

45:57.015 --> 45:58.317
to try to make it up to you.

46:00.317 --> 46:02.318
So in a few days,

46:02.319 --> 46:04.421
when you've had a chance to mourn,

46:04.422 --> 46:06.622
we can get coffee and discuss it.

46:06.623 --> 46:08.392
- I'd like that.
- Good.

46:08.393 --> 46:09.727
- I'd really like that.
- Good.

46:09.728 --> 46:11.394
OK, great. Now...

46:11.395 --> 46:13.195
- Dr. Lang?
- Yeah?

46:13.196 --> 46:15.502
I had a really funny dream a few nights ago.

46:18.502 --> 46:21.371
You and I, we lived in the countryside.

46:21.372 --> 46:23.741
In England.

46:24.741 --> 46:27.711
And we rode horses everywhere.

46:27.712 --> 46:29.646
And mine was a...

46:29.647 --> 46:32.615
Oh, he was a big white stallion

46:32.616 --> 46:36.385
with a silvery mane. And yours
was a beautiful Arabian.

46:36.386 --> 46:38.121
And we were in the forest...

46:38.122 --> 46:40.523
...and the light was dim,

46:40.524 --> 46:42.825
and we were galloping past each other,

46:42.826 --> 46:46.530
we were passing each other by when we both...

46:46.531 --> 46:49.666
...we made our animals stop.

46:49.667 --> 46:54.271
<i>I mean, I know you could say
it was just a dream</i>

46:54.272 --> 46:55.808
but it...

46:56.808 --> 47:00.510
What happened next felt...

47:00.511 --> 47:02.584
It felt very real to me.

47:06.584 --> 47:10.420
And... if you would

47:10.421 --> 47:13.622
like me to show you what I did...

47:13.623 --> 47:16.293
You, you don't, you don't even have to agree,

47:16.294 --> 47:20.232
just... just don't disagree.

47:21.232 --> 47:24.401
And then it will be like...

47:24.402 --> 47:26.607
...you're not doing
anything at all.

47:29.607 --> 47:32.448
I wouldn't want you to get in trouble.

touches turns to gold.

OK.

Instead, I'm gonna offer you a choice.

You pick up this phone, right now,

you call your wife and you tell
her what you did or...

56:06.056 --> 56:08.891
I was gonna kill you.

56:08.892 --> 56:10.994
But then I remembered

56:10.995 --> 56:13.262
I'm not that kind of man.

56:13.263 --> 56:16.365
I'm the kind of man who makes a mistake

56:16.366 --> 56:18.001
and then makes amends.

56:18.002 --> 56:20.737
I'm the kind of man who got into
a drunk driving accident

56:20.738 --> 56:23.271
and nearly killed a kid,
but did I get some fancy-pants

56:23.272 --> 56:27.342
lawyer to get me off scot-free 'cause I
was just below the legal limit? Uh-uh!

56:27.343 --> 56:29.244
I prayed for forgiveness,

56:29.245 --> 56:31.216
and I pled guilty.
And when the judge ordered me

56:32.216 --> 56:34.717
to pay a million dollars to the kid's family

56:34.718 --> 56:37.753
and he sent me to jail
for a month, did I stop there?

56:37.754 --> 56:42.724
No. I started helping people.
Volunteering.

56:42.725 --> 56:44.793
Philanthropy.

56:44.794 --> 56:48.334
'Cause that's the kind of guy I am.

56:50.334 --> 56:52.169
You may wish you're that kinda man,

56:52.170 --> 56:54.671
but you're not.

56:54.672 --> 56:58.082
You're a scumbag home-wrecker.

57:05.082 --> 57:07.319
You wrecked my home, Jeffrey.

57:10.319 --> 57:12.223
You wrecked my home.

57:14.223 --> 57:18.860
And I could just as easily
wreck yours with one phone call.

57:18.861 --> 57:21.831
But I don't need to do that.

57:21.832 --> 57:24.300
Because you're the kinda guy

57:24.301 --> 57:27.940
who's gonna fuck it all up himself.

58:03.940 --> 58:07.276
[cell phone ringing]

58:07.277 --> 58:08.419
[sighs]

58:15.419 --> 58:18.960
[ringing continues]

58:22.960 --> 58:24.494
Hey, Lincoln, how are you?

58:24.495 --> 58:26.796
<i>Very good, very good.</i>

58:26.797 --> 58:30.032
<i>So guess what?
I got the job, Doc.</i>

58:30.033 --> 58:32.834
No kidding, that's great news.

58:32.835 --> 58:34.238
<i>Actually, I start tomorrow.</i>

58:34.239 --> 58:36.838
<i>And to celebrate,
this weekend my wife and I</i>

58:36.839 --> 58:38.373
<i>were thinking we could
have you and your family</i>

58:38.374 --> 58:39.841
- <i>over to dinner.</i>
- <i>[beeping]</i>

58:39.842 --> 58:41.145
What's that noise, Lincoln?

58:41.146 --> 58:45.046
<i>Oh, I'm all tied up to my
dialysis machine right now.</i>

58:45.047 --> 58:50.821
<i>Damn thing starts makin' noises
for no good reason sometimes.</i>

58:51.821 --> 58:54.893
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>[beeping continues]</i>

58:56.893 --> 58:58.293
<i>Hello?</i>

58:58.294 --> 58:59.829
[chatter]

58:59.830 --> 59:01.463
Thanks for visiting me, Doc.

59:01.464 --> 59:04.432
Nobody ever visits me here.

59:04.433 --> 59:06.872
Of course.

59:09.872 --> 59:11.841
So I hope you don't mind me askin',

59:11.842 --> 59:15.878
I was just wondering what your
doctor says in terms of, uh,

59:15.879 --> 59:18.246
how long it is before your kidneys fail?

59:18.247 --> 59:21.284
A couple years, if I'm lucky.

59:21.285 --> 59:23.318
So they say.

59:23.319 --> 59:25.421
But I'm feeling strong,

59:25.422 --> 59:26.956
and the way I see it,

59:26.957 --> 59:30.293
if God can create the earth in seven days,

59:30.294 --> 59:32.160
why can't I get lucky

59:32.161 --> 59:35.303
and find myself a kidney
in the next year or two?

59:40.303 --> 59:41.871
Hey, Doc.

59:41.872 --> 59:44.574
I hope I didn't depress you with that.

59:44.575 --> 59:46.175
Today's a really good day.

59:46.176 --> 59:48.482
I know, yeah, yeah, of course.

59:53.482 --> 59:55.517
- To Doc.
- To Doc.

59:55.518 --> 59:56.552
A saint.

59:56.553 --> 59:58.086
[chuckles]
Oh, not a saint.

59:58.087 --> 59:59.355
Well, in my book you are.

59:59.356 --> 01:00:01.423
And one heck of a basketball player.

01:00:01.424 --> 01:00:03.626
[chuckles]
Oh, now are you just saying that

01:00:03.627 --> 01:00:05.827
- to make him feel good?
- [Lincoln] Well, let me tell you,

01:00:05.962 --> 01:00:08.430
if your husband understood how to play defense,

01:00:08.431 --> 01:00:10.533
had a better jump shot,
and was about six foot nine,

01:00:10.534 --> 01:00:12.968
he'd be killin' 'em in the NBA right now.

01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:14.439
[laughing]

01:00:16.439 --> 01:00:19.307
Hey, hey, you mind if I
say a prayer before we eat?

01:00:19.308 --> 01:00:21.614
Of course not.

01:00:24.614 --> 01:00:26.314
Dear Heavenly Father,

01:00:26.315 --> 01:00:28.218
we thank you for the food
that's been prepared before us,

01:00:29.218 --> 01:00:31.355
for the nourishment
and strengthening of our bodies.

01:00:31.356 --> 01:00:33.356
In the name of Christ Jesus, amen.

01:00:33.357 --> 01:00:34.225
[all]
Amen.

01:00:35.225 --> 01:00:37.994
- All right, you guys can eat.
- Whoo.

01:00:37.995 --> 01:00:40.463
May I have the salt and pepper?

01:00:40.464 --> 01:00:44.099
So you haven't told me how the team is yet.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.535
Doc, these girls hustle
like you wouldn't believe.

01:00:46.536 --> 01:00:49.171
And there's some talent on the team, too.

01:00:49.172 --> 01:00:50.673
Oh, that's great.

01:00:50.674 --> 01:00:52.642
Really great.

01:00:52.643 --> 01:00:54.075
But I've gotta tell you,

01:00:54.076 --> 01:00:57.246
what I like the best about it is

01:00:57.247 --> 01:01:00.687
my kids are finally excited about
something their daddy does.

01:01:03.687 --> 01:01:05.387
Thank you, Doc.

01:01:05.388 --> 01:01:06.357
You made this possible, bro.

01:01:08.357 --> 01:01:11.626
[exhales]
You changed my life, Doc.

01:01:11.627 --> 01:01:13.230
So why can't Angela donate?

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:16.600
Oh, she has some kind of
congenital heart defect,

01:01:16.601 --> 01:01:18.601
which means an operation would be risky.

01:01:18.602 --> 01:01:20.001
[car alarm beeps]

01:01:20.002 --> 01:01:23.639
He seems so alive, you know, and healthy.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.480
He's so far down on the list to
get a transplant it's not funny.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.115
I know it's kind of an absurd thought, but...

01:01:34.116 --> 01:01:36.988
...why shouldn't it be me?

01:01:37.988 --> 01:01:42.564
Here, I've been doing a little research.

01:01:47.564 --> 01:01:51.099
"Living organ donation."

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.568
Wow.

01:01:52.569 --> 01:01:54.603
OK, you're serious.

01:01:54.604 --> 01:01:57.606
You've been thinking about this for a while.

01:01:57.607 --> 01:02:00.142
Well, a bit.

01:02:00.143 --> 01:02:03.614
[exhales]
This is...

01:02:05.614 --> 01:02:07.316
This is amazing.

01:02:07.317 --> 01:02:09.684
I'm just, I'm, I'm worried,

01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:13.655
uh, what if Miles needs your kidney one day?

01:02:13.656 --> 01:02:17.293
Well, I thought that we could do
a test to make sure both

01:02:17.294 --> 01:02:19.427
you and Miles have healthy kidneys,

01:02:19.428 --> 01:02:20.230
and if so,

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:24.166
the risk is incredibly small.

01:02:24.167 --> 01:02:27.571
I'm not opposed to doing some tests.

01:02:28.571 --> 01:02:31.773
I actually think it's a really wonderful thought

01:02:31.774 --> 01:02:34.415
to do something truly selfless.

01:02:39.415 --> 01:02:42.203
[chuckles]
You weren't expecting this.
[Laughs]

<i>All right, there you go, there you go.</i>

01:03:02.572 --> 01:03:05.810
OK, pick up the rhythm, guys.

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:09.378
All right, good, good.
Right back to the other side.

Lincoln.

01:03:11.547 --> 01:03:14.249
Hey, Doc.
What are you doin' here?

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:15.584
How's it goin'?

01:03:15.585 --> 01:03:17.520
It's goin' great.
The girls are great.

01:03:17.521 --> 01:03:20.688
Yeah. Uh, I come
bearing some good news.

01:03:20.689 --> 01:03:22.458
You know I like good news.

01:03:22.459 --> 01:03:24.326
After dinner at your house,
my wife and I were talking

01:03:24.327 --> 01:03:27.262
about your, your health situation.

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:29.532
And um, long story short,

01:03:29.533 --> 01:03:31.701
the last few weeks have been
all about kidney donation

01:03:31.702 --> 01:03:34.235
and we have researched it, talked about it,

01:03:34.236 --> 01:03:37.273
done a bunch of tests, and we came to agree

01:03:37.274 --> 01:03:39.076
that it was the right thing to do.

01:03:39.077 --> 01:03:40.642
So I called your doctor and...

01:03:40.643 --> 01:03:42.577
Whoa, wait a minute.

01:03:42.578 --> 01:03:44.114
Are you saying what I think you're sayin'?

01:03:44.115 --> 01:03:47.316
We are a perfect match, Lincoln.

01:03:47.317 --> 01:03:49.385
The same blood type, everything.

01:03:49.386 --> 01:03:51.720
Doc, yes!

01:03:55.626 --> 01:03:57.626
Am I looking at a man or an angel?

- Ladies, ladies, hold up, hold up.

This is my friend,
Dr. Lang.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.767
And he's gonna give me one of his kidneys!

I got so much love for you right now, Doc.

Gimme your hands.

I'm so glad this worked out, Lincoln.

01:05:56.779 --> 01:05:59.414
So am I, Doc.

01:05:59.415 --> 01:06:02.383
So am I.

01:06:02.384 --> 01:06:05.820
Oh. My minister came by to
visit me this morning.

01:06:05.821 --> 01:06:08.856
And we were talking about what
a miracle it is, what you did,

01:06:08.857 --> 01:06:12.595
and he had the idea to do
a special service in your honor.

01:06:12.596 --> 01:06:14.229
I don't need to be honored.

01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:15.731
Wouldn't be for your vanity, Doc.

01:06:15.732 --> 01:06:17.733
It'd be for our congregation,

01:06:17.734 --> 01:06:20.937
to inspire them to do their own charity work.

01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:25.541
I think it would be, you know, painless.

01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:28.943
But if you'd prefer not to...

01:06:28.944 --> 01:06:32.014
No. I'll do it.

01:06:32.015 --> 01:06:33.849

to find me here?

What a wonderful thing you did for him,

saving his life, getting him
the job, everything.

the positive karma

01:07:32.509 --> 01:07:36.045
Um... speaking of karma,

01:07:36.046 --> 01:07:39.380
there's something I need to tell you,

01:07:39.381 --> 01:07:43.452
which may slam the karmic
wheel of fate down on me hard.

Um...

01:07:44.587 --> 01:07:47.359

but after Matthew was poisoned

01:07:52.062 --> 01:07:54.829

01:08:05.642 --> 01:08:08.343
Anyway, they finally came by yesterday

01:08:08.344 --> 01:08:10.953
and they...
they put this on your door.

01:08:17.953 --> 01:08:20.456
I am really sorry, Jeffrey.

01:08:20.457 --> 01:08:22.825
[exhales]
I, I...

01:08:22.826 --> 01:08:24.658
...probably would've done
the same thing

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.528
- if you'd killed my pet.
- [exhales]

01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:28.401
[chuckles]

01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:33.035
There's something else.

01:08:33.036 --> 01:08:35.002
I'm pregnant.

01:08:35.004 --> 01:08:36.545
With your baby.

01:08:43.545 --> 01:08:45.647
I know what you're thinking.

01:08:45.648 --> 01:08:47.950
But you don't need to be worried.

01:08:47.951 --> 01:08:50.419
It's all gonna be all right.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.719
It will all work out.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.455
Things always do.

01:08:54.456 --> 01:08:57.738
No. Things don't
always work out.

01:09:09.738 --> 01:09:11.553
You want me to kill it, don't you?

01:09:23.553 --> 01:09:24.724
[clears throat]

01:09:28.724 --> 01:09:33.728
[screaming]

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:35.031
[Miles]
I wanna go in the house.

01:09:35.032 --> 01:09:36.934
[Nealy sighs]
We're goin'.

01:09:37.934 --> 01:09:41.073
[groans]
OK.

01:09:45.073 --> 01:09:46.944
[sighs]

01:09:48.944 --> 01:09:51.045
I thought about fixing it myself,

01:09:51.046 --> 01:09:53.487
but it just didn't seem worth it.

01:09:58.487 --> 01:09:59.623
[chuckles]

01:10:01.623 --> 01:10:03.791
[Lila]
Don't worry, it's decaf.

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:06.562
I, I would never poison our baby with a

01:10:06.563 --> 01:10:08.996
double shot of real espresso.

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:11.666
They say it can cause autism.

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:13.569
Then again, you're the baby doctor.

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:15.903
Hey, can I ask, um...

01:10:15.904 --> 01:10:19.540
Are you one hundred percent
certain that you're pregnant?

01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:21.175
Yes.

01:10:21.176 --> 01:10:24.979
[whispering]
I took the test twice, I peed twice,

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.714
- just to make sure.
- Lila...

01:10:26.715 --> 01:10:29.017
Do you really think, in your heart,

01:10:29.018 --> 01:10:30.687
that this is the right thing to do,

01:10:30.688 --> 01:10:33.522
for you and I to be having a baby together?

01:10:33.523 --> 01:10:35.891
Oh... absolutely.
It's a miracle.

01:10:35.892 --> 01:10:37.593
- No.
- Yes, Jeff.

01:10:37.594 --> 01:10:38.692
I feel the life growing inside of me.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:39.996
- No, Lila,
- I can feel it

01:10:39.997 --> 01:10:41.897
- blooming
- Lila, please.

01:10:41.898 --> 01:10:44.766
- and blossoming and growing.
- Lila, please. Lila. Look...

01:10:44.767 --> 01:10:47.870
Lila! What fuckin'
planet do you live on?!

01:10:47.871 --> 01:10:51.240
There is no way, no chance under
any circumstance,

01:10:51.241 --> 01:10:54.175
that I'll be fathering a child with you.

01:10:54.176 --> 01:10:56.745
Jeffrey, I want you to understand

01:10:56.746 --> 01:10:58.513
that once our little one is born

01:10:58.514 --> 01:11:01.116
I'm not expecting child support

01:11:01.117 --> 01:11:03.652
or anything like that.

01:11:03.653 --> 01:11:05.988
I just want our little one
to grow up knowing his father.

01:11:05.989 --> 01:11:08.824
And if you think about it, it's perfect.

01:11:08.825 --> 01:11:10.193
The little one will be right next door.

01:11:10.194 --> 01:11:13.661
You can come by and visit any time you like.

01:11:13.662 --> 01:11:15.731
You can be like the charming uncle

01:11:15.732 --> 01:11:18.303
and that... that wife of
yours never has to find out.

01:11:20.303 --> 01:11:22.103
She won't know.

01:11:22.104 --> 01:11:23.604
Bye.

01:11:23.605 --> 01:11:26.708
[baby crying]

01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:28.813
See you later.

01:11:30.813 --> 01:11:32.854
[knocking]

01:11:37.854 --> 01:11:39.898
[baby continues crying]

01:11:49.898 --> 01:11:51.291
[yelling]

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:19.126
[Lila]
I... I don't have any medical insurance

01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:21.862
so I thought maybe

01:12:21.863 --> 01:12:24.974
you could help me out.

01:12:31.974 --> 01:12:35.076
You wouldn't put anything up there

01:12:35.077 --> 01:12:36.281
that would hurt the baby, would you?

01:12:38.281 --> 01:12:40.357
No. I wouldn't do that.

01:12:47.357 --> 01:12:49.926
[Lila]
Does that mean...?

01:12:50.926 --> 01:12:52.234
- It's alive.
- [chuckles]

01:12:59.234 --> 01:13:01.236
[Lincoln]
Dang, Doc.

01:13:01.237 --> 01:13:05.309
That's a pretty tight spot
this woman's got you in.

01:13:07.309 --> 01:13:10.012
You know, Doc, my mother used to say,

01:13:10.013 --> 01:13:16.050
"It's impossible to reason
with an unreasonable person."

01:13:16.051 --> 01:13:17.819
I think that's what you're dealing with,

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.090
with this woman here.

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:25.027
I can barely see straight.

01:13:25.028 --> 01:13:29.097
And the things I'm thinking,
you, you couldn't imagine.

01:13:29.098 --> 01:13:30.300
Like what?

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.402
Like all day...

01:13:34.403 --> 01:13:37.339
...I'm fantasizing
about her dying.

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:41.809
I must've imagined it a hundred different ways.

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:45.446
Actually, last night, I had a dream about it.

01:13:45.447 --> 01:13:50.720
A wish fulfillment dream, huh, Doc?

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.261
I guess so.

01:13:59.261 --> 01:14:00.331
What was it?

01:14:03.331 --> 01:14:05.769
[sighs]
It was ridiculous.

01:14:07.769 --> 01:14:10.237
There were these two football players

01:14:10.238 --> 01:14:12.840
runnin' through the woods
in the park by my house

01:14:12.841 --> 01:14:14.942
where I sometimes go jogging

01:14:14.943 --> 01:14:18.314
and I see her walking her
little dog every night at dusk.

01:14:19.314 --> 01:14:21.348
They're just galloping through the woods

01:14:21.349 --> 01:14:24.885
in full game day uniforms.

01:14:24.886 --> 01:14:28.122
<i>One of 'em hurls
a ball through the air.</i>

01:14:28.123 --> 01:14:30.826
<i>As it sails,</i>

01:14:30.827 --> 01:14:35.165
I realize it's an arrow.

01:14:36.165 --> 01:14:38.871
It splits her head wide open.

01:14:41.871 --> 01:14:45.406
I woke up totally relieved.

01:14:45.407 --> 01:14:49.982
Until I realized it was just a dream.

01:14:52.982 --> 01:14:54.922
Sick, huh?

01:15:00.922 --> 01:15:02.924
It's gonna be all right, Doc.

01:15:02.925 --> 01:15:04.996
[exhales]

01:15:06.996 --> 01:15:09.134
[clears throat]

01:15:11.134 --> 01:15:13.880
It's gonna be all right.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.115
Meredith just called and said

01:16:00.116 --> 01:16:03.995
that Peter and Rebecca are getting divorced.

01:16:12.995 --> 01:16:15.830
<i>[Jeff]</i>
<i>"Once upon a time, but not long ago,</i>

01:16:15.831 --> 01:16:19.034
a mom and her girl were folding washed clothes.

01:16:19.035 --> 01:16:22.103
When suddenly, Mom noticed something amiss.

01:16:22.104 --> 01:16:25.874
Something weird, something
crazy, a real mystery this!

01:16:25.875 --> 01:16:27.241
'Where are the socks?'

01:16:27.242 --> 01:16:29.143

Hey. Have you seen
my keys anywhere?

01:16:35.483 --> 01:16:36.883
<i>No, I have no idea.</i>

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:38.384
<i>Uh, have you looked
in your purse?</i>

01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:39.686
Yes, of course I looked in my purse.

01:16:39.687 --> 01:16:41.355
<i>You didn't take them with you
when you left the house</i>

01:16:41.356 --> 01:16:42.623
<i>this morning, did you?</i>

01:16:42.624 --> 01:16:44.228

<i>No. What about Miles' toy box?</i>

01:16:45.228 --> 01:16:48.532
<i>Remember when he hid
the remote in there?</i>

It happened in the park.
Less than a mile away.

The police are now going door to door.

01:19:21.349 --> 01:19:24.552

Sort of puts a damper on tonight's celebration,

01:19:24.553 --> 01:19:25.399
doesn't it?

01:19:37.399 --> 01:19:39.750

That's a plane, you know what that is.

No, that.

01:21:31.212 --> 01:21:33.867
Oh, that?
I don't know what that is.

01:21:51.867 --> 01:21:54.411
That was pretty moving, huh?

Where, where are we going?

Hey.

I cheated my way through med school.

01:22:25.867 --> 01:22:27.468
What?

01:22:27.469 --> 01:22:30.772
Cheat sheets.
Very elaborate,

01:22:30.773 --> 01:22:34.845
written on little pieces
of paper in every pocket.

01:22:37.845 --> 01:22:39.981
[sighs]

01:22:39.982 --> 01:22:42.616
When I was a kid, I had this doctor

01:22:42.617 --> 01:22:45.853
who misdiagnosed my chicken pox as dermatitis.

01:22:45.854 --> 01:22:49.523
I almost died.
Did I ever tell you that?

01:22:49.524 --> 01:22:51.595
No.

01:22:53.595 --> 01:22:55.696
While I was in the hospital,

01:22:55.697 --> 01:22:58.366
my mother and grandmother were sitting around,

01:22:58.367 --> 01:23:00.535

"Well, I guess not all
doctors made A's."

01:23:03.738 --> 01:23:08.875

Stop it! Stop! No!

01:23:55.424 --> 01:23:58.828
You are freaking me out.

01:24:00.828 --> 01:24:04.766
What is going on?
[breathes heavily]

01:24:04.767 --> 01:24:07.403
I fucked Rebecca.

01:24:08.403 --> 01:24:09.836
What?

[breathes heavily]

01:24:15.711 --> 01:24:19.080
I don't mean to hurt you telling you this.

- I'm just trying to

01:24:20.815 --> 01:24:23.951
tell you the truth for a change.

Rebecca Mazzoni.

- Oh, great. Good.

01:24:36.764 --> 01:24:38.965
But Peter found out.
