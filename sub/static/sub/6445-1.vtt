00:02.127 --> 00:03.992
Previously on Smallville:

00:04.338 --> 00:07.000
You must ﬁnd the human vessel
and destroy it.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.964
The cost of one life
is the price that must be paid.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.636
Even if that life is your son?

00:13.972 --> 00:16.304
I don't know how
I could have ever loved you.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.383
I don't know
if I'm ever gonna see you again.

00:21.605 --> 00:24.017
You need to know the truth about me.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.104
I won't let you destroy this planet
like you did Krypton.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.484
You don't have a choice.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.187
Then it begins.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.539
-What have I done?
-You've opened the portal for Zod.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.499
Mr. Luthor!

00:58.892 --> 01:02.055
And now, the season premiere
of Smallville.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.399
Hello?

02:42.204 --> 02:43.660
Is anyone there?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.790
Thank you.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.466
Welcome to the Phantom Zone.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.653
Get her!

04:53.961 --> 04:55.041
Mr. Luthor!

05:06.098 --> 05:08.259
Mr. Luthor,
we need to get you off the street.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.424
-Your son's already inside.
-Lex?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.763
-Yes, sir.
-No! No!

05:12.938 --> 05:14.303
Go. I'll get her.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.700
The city's tearing itself apart.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.412
All those people.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.075
-We have to help them.
-Help them?

05:36.253 --> 05:39.245
With the powers Fine gave you,
you could end the riots.

05:39.423 --> 05:42.665
-You could save everyone, Lex.
-Lex Luthor is dead.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.634
My name is Zod.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.150
That was him, wasn't it?
That was Zod.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.942
Clark must not have been able
to get to Lex in time...

06:11.371 --> 06:13.362
...to stop him.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.537
Zod has taken over Lex.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.497
Clark.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.545
You don't think Zod actually...?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.543
It's the dagger.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.797
The dagger that Jor-El gave to Clark
might still be at the farm.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.508
We can use that to stop Zod.

06:31.850 --> 06:35.468
You mean kill him. Kill Lex.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.056
I'll make my way to the Daily Planet...

06:41.276 --> 06:44.689
...and see if I can learn anything else
about this Kryptonian virus.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.900
If I can match those symbols
to the ones that you were scribbling--

06:48.075 --> 06:50.031
That won't help us. We—

06:53.413 --> 06:57.827
-We need Clark to decipher them.
-But you're Jor-El's oracle.

06:58.001 --> 07:01.243
Don't you have access to some sort
of Kryptonian-English dictionary?

07:01.421 --> 07:06.290
The connection that I felt with Jor-El
and the fortress...

07:07.385 --> 07:09.046
...it's gone.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.681
I can't feel his presence anymore.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.056
But if we can get to that dagger,
we can stop Zod.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.596
We can stop all of this.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.607
I can't make it back to Smallville
with my leg like this.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.568
Here.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.820
You take care, Miss Sullivan.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.494
You too, Mr. Luthor.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.876
Clark.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.925
Wherever you are,
I could really use your help right now.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.559
Where are you from? Where?

08:08.947 --> 08:12.656
l was born on Krypton,
l was raised on Earth.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.910
Earth?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.662
KaI-EI?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.961
How do you know my
Kryptonian name?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.248
I knew your father.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.806
Let go.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.147
-Where are you taking me?
-Zod doesn't take orders, he gives them.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.188
What is Zod?
What are you talking about?

08:55.535 --> 08:59.778
Oh, God. You're one of those
things from that ship.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.289
Aethyr and Nam-Ek?
Mere foot soldiers here at my command.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.293
Whatever is happening, it's not you.
It's the ship.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.830
It's Fine controlling you.
You have to ﬁght it, Lex.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.044
I already told you, Lexis gone.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.589
I don't believe that.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.799
Do you really think Zod cares
what a primitive like you believes?

09:21.519 --> 09:24.556
If Lex is really dead...

09:24.731 --> 09:28.519
...then why waste your time
with a primitive like me?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.698
To bear witness
to the end of the human era...

09:36.868 --> 09:38.654
...and the rebirth of Krypton.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.992
-Krypton?
-A shining jewel in a vast, dark universe.

09:43.166 --> 09:47.284
And you have the privilege
of playing a part in its resurrection.

10:08.483 --> 10:11.395
There's no escaping
what's about to happen.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.963
Lois?

10:34.926 --> 10:36.757
Lois?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.426
Lois?

10:43.893 --> 10:45.884
Lois?

10:51.735 --> 10:53.350
Oh, my God. Lois.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.610
Lois.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.611
Oh, my God.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.443
Sweetie.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.543
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.172
Lois? Lois?

11:43.828 --> 11:48.663
Mayday. Mayday. Our plane is down.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.999
Can anyone hear me?

12:13.858 --> 12:16.190
Lois. Lois.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.852
Martha Kent.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.693
Jor-El.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.986
This is the fortress
Clark told me about.

12:29.541 --> 12:34.035
Why did you bring us here?
Why did you crash our plane?

12:34.212 --> 12:39.047
You were taken as pawns
by the Brain InterActive Construct...

12:39.217 --> 12:41.959
...the being you know as Milton Fine.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.214
Clark.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.722
[gave him a dagger
to kill the vessel of Zod.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.384
Instead, he chose
to use it against Fine.

12:51.563 --> 12:54.020
Where is he? Where--? Where is Clark?

12:54.190 --> 12:57.182
The dagger is part of this fortress.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.852
Plunging it into Fine
destroyed all copies of him...

13:01.030 --> 13:04.693
...but also damaged this structure
and released Zod.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.402
What happened to my son, Jor-El?

13:08.580 --> 13:11.697
Banished forever by Zod.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.706
Bring him back.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.121
You have to bring him home.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.292
Not within my power.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.551
His destiny...

13:25.722 --> 13:27.883
...is now his own.

13:28.892 --> 13:33.886
I've lost my husband and now my son
because of your games.

13:34.063 --> 13:37.647
We have both lost much, Martha Kent.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.025
But you must put aside
your anguish...

13:41.196 --> 13:44.108
...if you wish to save your world.

13:44.282 --> 13:47.866
Kal-El's mission must be completed.

13:48.036 --> 13:52.575
Retrieve the dagger
and kill Zod's vessel...

13:52.749 --> 13:55.331
...Lex Luthor.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.413
You want me to murder Lex?

13:57.587 --> 14:00.920
Zod has taken over his body...

14:01.090 --> 14:06.585
...and given him all the powers
of a true Kryptonian.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.300
How am I supposed to do that?

14:09.766 --> 14:12.599
You must ﬁnd a way...

14:12.769 --> 14:15.636
...or all is lost.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.947
All right.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.449
Send me back.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.288
Everything you will have done
for Kal-El. ..

14:35.458 --> 14:38.621
you have my deepest gratitude.

14:38.795 --> 14:44.165
I could not have wished
for a brighter light to guide my son.

14:44.342 --> 14:48.301
Farewell, Martha Kent.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.691
Who are you?

15:08.324 --> 15:11.532
Raya. Not that names matter here.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.819
Where is here, exactly?

15:14.539 --> 15:18.908
Jor-El created this place to hold criminals
from the 28 known inhabited galaxies.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.121
So it's a prison?

15:21.838 --> 15:24.830
That makes you an inmate.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.043
I may be trapped here,
but I'm not one of the prisoners.

15:31.639 --> 15:35.131
Am I supposed to just trust you?
I'm running a little low on that lately.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.640
Good.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.015
In the Zone, trust can get you killed.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.563
Or worse.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.559
Most vicious offenders
are condemned for eternity...

15:46.738 --> 15:50.481
...their corporeal bodies destroyed,
their essence haunting the wasteland.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.400
The phantoms,
like the ones that attacked me.

15:53.786 --> 15:57.324
The crystal your father gave me
is the only thing they fear.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.458
How did you know Jor-El?

16:00.460 --> 16:04.874
-l was one of his assistants.
-When you were 5?

16:07.592 --> 16:09.958
Time is meaningless here.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.256
I wanted to stay with Jor-El
in the ﬁnal hours...

16:16.309 --> 16:18.470
...but he wouldn't hear of it.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.808
He thought I'd have a better chance
in the Phantom Zone.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.311
Why didn't he and my mother
come with you?

16:26.486 --> 16:31.321
He wouldn't stop trying to save Krypton
and your mother wouldn't leave his side.

16:36.454 --> 16:39.491
This is all I have left of your father.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.501
Every day, he still saves my life.

16:52.637 --> 16:57.381
l have to go. I have to stop Zod.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.848
-Zod?
-He's on Earth because of me.

17:03.022 --> 17:07.231
Raya, you were my father's assistant.
You helped him create this place.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.815
-ls there a way out?
-Zod is a soldier. He will kill you.

17:11.489 --> 17:15.732
If there is a way
for you to save everyone you loved...

17:15.910 --> 17:18.367
...wouldn't you risk dying?

17:23.292 --> 17:25.669
You truly are your father's son.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.884
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't shoot.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.061
Look, okay, I work here.
You don't have--

18:36.199 --> 18:37.314
Chloe?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.359
Hey.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.571
This isn't because I didn't
call you back, is it?

18:47.043 --> 18:48.704
Jimmy Olsen.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.596
How did you know to come here?
This is Lex's home.

19:01.766 --> 19:06.260
If there wasn't part of him still alive inside
you, how did you remember this place?

19:06.562 --> 19:08.268
You had feelings for this human.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.431
Yes.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.280
His feelings for you were also strong.

19:20.618 --> 19:24.827
They left an unpleasant taste
when l consumed his essence.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.325
This virus crippling your technology...

19:31.504 --> 19:34.416
...can only be stopped
at the original point of infection.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.751
It's the only reason I'm here.

19:48.521 --> 19:52.309
-You got rid of the virus.
-I need it to acquire information.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.816
The power.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.438
It would take days for your people
to restore it.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.572
If they had that much time.

20:05.663 --> 20:09.372
-The Pentagon.
-There's something there I need.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.583
-What are you going to do?
-Finish what I've started.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.621
The black ship would have sent a pulse
around the world, reshaping its crust.

20:16.799 --> 20:17.914
Into what?

20:20.303 --> 20:21.383
My home.

20:23.264 --> 20:26.472
That planet you were talking about.
Krypton.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.430
Only this time it will be perfect.
The start of an empire...

20:30.605 --> 20:32.721
...ruled by the bloodline of Zod.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.855
I thought you needed the black ship.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.157
Its hard drive can
still initiate the pulse.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.864
But I need access to your military
satellites to broadcast it.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.865
I'm not gonna let you do this.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.495
There's nothing to be afraid of.

20:55.713 --> 20:59.171
The fate of your race will not be yours
if you give me what I want.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.790
What?

21:01.427 --> 21:02.542
An heir.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.720
We'll discuss this further
when I return from your Pentagon.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.715
Why haven't you used
the gateway yourself?

21:50.893 --> 21:53.475
It won't open for anyone
except the House of El.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.386
Your father kept it a secret...

21:55.564 --> 21:58.647
...a back door in case anyone tried
to imprison his family here.

21:58.818 --> 22:02.106
-Why would he have to worry about that?
-Jor-El was a great man.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.146
And like all great men,
there were those who wished him ill.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.247
Kal-El.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.921
Nam-Ek, wait. Don't kill him.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.174
Why should I spare his life?

22:25.344 --> 22:28.461
-The one who sent me here.
-He can open the gateway.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.465
l was bringing him to you.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.309
He can free us all.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.486
Martha. Martha.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.584
You're all right.

22:58.544 --> 23:03.163
-Your son, Lex, I--
-I know, I know.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.877
I know what I have to do.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.678
Where's Clark?

23:20.357 --> 23:21.972
Lana.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.525
I don't know where Clark is.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.070
I heard him talking to Chloe
about killing Lex.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.983
-I didn't understand what was happening.
-Lana, where's Lex? We have to ﬁnd him.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.321
It's too late.

23:33.496 --> 23:36.954
The things he can do now, I don't think
there's anyone who can stop him.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.910
There might be.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.961
l have to kill him with this.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.458
You would never get close enough
to even use that.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.509
But I can.

23:57.436 --> 24:01.270
A lot of people are going to die
if you don't let me do this.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.813
It's the only way.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.934
That's all it takes to end the world?

24:49.738 --> 24:51.990
And begin a new one.

24:54.076 --> 24:57.068
You freed yourself but didn't run.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.075
Why?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.912
I realized there was nothing to run to.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.994
Sometimes...

25:07.590 --> 25:10.957
...to survive, you have to give up
the things that you care about...

25:13.596 --> 25:15.882
...and just give in to your fate.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.605
You would give me an heir?

25:24.273 --> 25:26.229
Willingly?

25:29.612 --> 25:31.978
The ﬁrst of many.

25:56.096 --> 26:00.465
Perhaps I have underestimated
the females of your species.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.223
Or maybe you just underestimated me.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.562
You shouldn't play with things
you don't understand.

26:32.675 --> 26:35.667
Did you really think
you could make a difference?

26:35.844 --> 26:38.677
Nothing can change
the fate of your world.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.447
l was in the basement
scanning photos into the database...

26:59.618 --> 27:01.950
...when everything went screwy.

27:02.121 --> 27:06.205
First ofﬁcial day at the Daily Planet,
and the world decides to end, you know?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.574
God, I can't believe
you actually work here.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.473
What is that?

27:37.197 --> 27:38.528
Jimmy!

27:44.913 --> 27:47.996
Since when are there earthquakes
in Metropolis?

27:50.502 --> 27:53.039
The others will be here soon.

27:58.052 --> 28:01.169
-Open the gateway.
-He doesn't know how.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.428
But I do. Give me the knife.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.136
No.

28:16.612 --> 28:21.697
His blood, the blood of the House of El,
is the key to open the gateway.

28:22.785 --> 28:23.900
I trusted you.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.911
Trust is for the weak.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.243
You're right.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.379
Nam-Ek!

28:40.427 --> 28:42.258
The gateway! Go, Kal-El!

28:53.774 --> 28:55.355
Raya!

29:28.934 --> 29:30.970
What's happening?

29:50.873 --> 29:51.908
Clark.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.826
Where is he?

30:00.340 --> 30:03.673
You could have been at my side
as Krypton is reborn.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.715
Now you'll die with all the rest.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.889
Let her go.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.139
Kal-El.

30:32.623 --> 30:36.036
lib}

30:55.562 --> 31:00.306
I don't know how you escaped the Zone,
but you were safer where you were.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.077
Did you really think
you could win, KaI-El?

31:14.248 --> 31:16.705
You're an idealistic fool,
just like your father.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.015
So easily beaten.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.556
Disappointing.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.769
I won't let you destroy Earth...

31:48.156 --> 31:49.612
...like you did Krypton.

31:49.783 --> 31:53.071
Jor-El couldn't stop me
and neither will his son.

31:53.245 --> 31:57.409
-Then I'll die trying.
-But you won't be the only one.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.495
These humans you care so much about.

32:01.461 --> 32:05.875
Swear your allegiance to me, and I'll
allow the ones you love the most to live.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.550
Kneel before Zod.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.684
Kneel.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.478
My father sends his regards.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.369
Jor-El.

33:18.538 --> 33:22.247
lib}

33:58.662 --> 34:01.074
-All right. Keep it steady.
-ltjust hurts so much.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.910
If you could just give me something
for the pain....

34:04.876 --> 34:05.956
Hey, Smallville.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.626
Hey, how you feeling?

34:10.132 --> 34:12.464
Bad enough to know I'm still alive.

34:12.926 --> 34:15.633
Guess I have your mom
to thank for that.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.004
You know, honestly...

34:19.307 --> 34:21.468
...I don't even remember
the plane going down.

34:21.977 --> 34:25.435
The cabin lost pressure,
I was gasping for breath...

34:26.732 --> 34:28.768
...and then I was in this palace of ice.

34:29.443 --> 34:32.105
And it was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

34:32.279 --> 34:35.146
l was bathed in this warm light...

34:35.741 --> 34:38.448
...and I knew everything
was gonna be okay.

34:41.288 --> 34:45.247
Lois, you were hurt pretty badly.

34:45.417 --> 34:50.161
-Maybe you were hallucinating.
-No, it was real.

34:53.884 --> 34:56.500
I think I died and went to heaven.

35:01.475 --> 35:03.682
Well, then I'm glad you're back.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.526
All right.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.661
All right.

35:29.503 --> 35:31.164
Thank you.

35:33.340 --> 35:36.582
Lana. Are you all right?

35:38.303 --> 35:40.043
What happened?

35:41.056 --> 35:45.015
-You don't remember?
-I was in the ﬁeld with you.

35:45.936 --> 35:48.018
Then everything went white.

35:49.439 --> 35:52.021
Next thing I know, I woke up here.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.279
Is that why you're afraid of me?

36:07.290 --> 36:08.791
Is all this because of me?

36:09.501 --> 36:11.662
Lex, you weren't yourself.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.878
The things you did,
it wasn't your fault.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.423
I tried to stop it.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.969
Lex, I almost killed you.

36:24.766 --> 36:28.384
Lana. Hey.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.635
I would have done the same thing.

36:31.565 --> 36:34.807
Look, I can never make up
for what happened.

36:34.985 --> 36:38.318
All I can do is move forward and
try to rebuild everything I've damaged.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.150
That might not be easy.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.779
Well, nothing worth it ever is.

36:59.175 --> 37:03.293
Clark. Oh, my God.
I thought you were dead.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.802
Hi.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.764
So did I for a while there.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.134
What happened? Where did you go?

37:11.813 --> 37:15.305
A place I never wanna go again.
Are you okay?

37:15.483 --> 37:18.975
Yeah, everything's great
now that you're here.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.783
Chloe.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.410
Before I left...

37:34.377 --> 37:36.288
...there was this moment that we....

37:36.463 --> 37:38.829
You mean when I laid one on you?

37:41.885 --> 37:46.128
Don't worry, it was the end of the world.
It's not like I'm expecting us to hook up.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.635
Yeah. Me neither.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.228
-Hey, bright eyes.
-Hey.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.771
Oh, bad time?

37:59.945 --> 38:01.355
No.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.736
l was just talking to a friend.

38:08.078 --> 38:11.115
-Grow them big in Kansas, don't they?
-l'm sorry.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.037
Jimmy Olsen, this is Clark Kent.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.871
Actually, it's...

38:18.755 --> 38:20.245
...James Olsen.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.836
Really? Since when?

38:26.054 --> 38:28.420
Oh, since...

38:28.598 --> 38:30.975
...now-ish....

38:35.772 --> 38:39.264
You wanna grab some dinner
at the vending machine?

38:39.859 --> 38:41.895
Love to, James.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.027
Clark, are you hungry?

38:50.120 --> 38:52.736
Me? No. I'm okay. You guys go ahead.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.783
Catch you later, OK

39:16.396 --> 39:19.058
Clark. How are Lois and Chloe?

39:19.899 --> 39:22.982
-Fine. They're both gonna be ﬁne.
-Good.

39:24.571 --> 39:27.813
Lionel told me
his connection to Jor-El is gone.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.324
Along with any inﬂuence
he had over him.

39:31.828 --> 39:35.696
Maybe we're all better off
without Jor-El in our lives.

39:37.542 --> 39:41.205
I took Raya's crystal to the fortress
for safekeeping.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.211
I tried to talk to Jor-El,
but he wouldn't--

39:47.719 --> 39:49.550
Wouldn't answer.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.968
The fortress is dead.

39:57.479 --> 39:59.561
Everything's changing.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.226
Dad's gone.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.486
I can't talk to Lex.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.144
Lana's....

40:11.159 --> 40:13.491
I don't know where to go from here.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.987
I didn't either when l was your age.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.910
Just follow your heart...

40:20.085 --> 40:22.167
...and you'll always do the right thing.

40:25.340 --> 40:29.174
Maybe some Kryptonians
believed the same thing.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.258
Jor-El sacriﬁced himself
trying to save Krypton.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.638
Raya died saving me.

40:40.188 --> 40:43.680
Every world needs its heroes, Clark.

40:44.359 --> 40:48.227
They inspire us to be
better than we are.

40:53.118 --> 40:58.533
And they protect us from the darkness
that's just around the corner.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.761
