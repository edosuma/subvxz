WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:04.190
(resolute music)

00:16.504 --> 00:18.165
(cheering)
(applauding)

00:18.165 --> 00:20.665
(tense music)

00:23.701 --> 00:26.230
(growling)

00:26.230 --> 00:28.600
- Attention every dragon, attention!

00:28.600 --> 00:32.380
As you are all well aware,
I am your town Mayor, Argon.

00:32.380 --> 00:36.300
And as you all know, if
I'm not shouting it out,

00:36.300 --> 00:38.214
it's not worth shouting about.

00:38.214 --> 00:40.260
With that said, I have some very,

00:40.260 --> 00:43.340
very exciting news for one and all!

00:43.340 --> 00:46.640
Our beloved Dragon Town is,
as you may have noticed,

00:46.640 --> 00:49.678
experiencing a bit of a Renaissance.

00:49.678 --> 00:52.760
We've got new, strange exotic creatures,

00:52.760 --> 00:57.110
like the camel, kangaroo,
and the elephant.

00:57.110 --> 01:00.600
Fortune telling, costume
contest, musical theater,

01:00.600 --> 01:04.300
blacksmithing, and of
course, wing painting.

01:04.300 --> 01:08.200
But, strangely, the one
thing we've never done here

01:08.200 --> 01:10.590
in Dragon Town, is a good old fashioned

01:10.590 --> 01:12.690
fire breathing contest.

01:12.690 --> 01:15.112
Well, the wait is over!

01:15.112 --> 01:17.437
(chattering)

01:17.437 --> 01:20.620
Come one, come all, hear ye, hear ye!

01:20.620 --> 01:24.740
Young and old, tell your
loved ones, tell your friends!

01:24.740 --> 01:26.513
Heck, tell your rivals too!

01:26.513 --> 01:30.600
For the first annual Dragon
Town Fire Breathing Contest,

01:30.600 --> 01:33.260
is officially open for entry!

01:33.260 --> 01:35.980
And the winner is sure to be crowned

01:35.980 --> 01:40.195
the most famous dragon in all the land!

01:40.195 --> 01:42.494
(roaring)
(cheering)

01:42.494 --> 01:44.911
(applauding)

01:47.120 --> 01:49.010
Some of you may not know that I'm quite

01:49.010 --> 01:51.010
the fire breather myself!

01:51.010 --> 01:53.727
I might throw a claw
into the ring, who knows?

01:53.727 --> 01:56.550
I want to check the rule
books on that since,

01:56.550 --> 01:57.840
I'm slated to be judge.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.070
At any rate, next Wednesday's the date,

02:01.070 --> 02:02.920
high noon is the time.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.190
Until then, breath deep,

02:05.190 --> 02:07.733
and practice your flame throwing, dragons!

02:07.733 --> 02:12.400
(cheering)
(applauding)

02:14.090 --> 02:17.550
- The Dragon Town Fire
Breathing Contest Grus,

02:17.550 --> 02:18.640
think of it!

02:18.640 --> 02:20.980
Dragons from far and wide,

02:20.980 --> 02:24.770
all getting up on stage
to blow fire and show off!

02:24.770 --> 02:27.350
What a spectacle it's gonna be!

02:27.350 --> 02:28.780
- It sure is Draco!

02:28.780 --> 02:31.140
You know, I've never even breathed fire.

02:31.140 --> 02:33.033
Do you think that's odd?

02:33.033 --> 02:34.520
- Nah, we're still little Grus.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.543
We have lots of growing up to do.

02:37.543 --> 02:39.090
I'll tell you this though,

02:39.090 --> 02:41.180
when my lungs are fully developed,

02:41.180 --> 02:45.390
I'm gonna be the biggest,
baddest, most fearsome,

02:45.390 --> 02:48.833
and revered fire breather the
Dragon Kingdom's ever known!

02:49.730 --> 02:51.940
- Wow, you think so?

02:51.940 --> 02:54.990
- Think so, I know so!

02:54.990 --> 02:58.110
You have to envision your dreams Grus,

02:58.110 --> 03:00.530
before you can make 'em come true!

03:00.530 --> 03:03.290
- Oh, that sounds like magic.

03:03.290 --> 03:07.370
- It's not magic, it's just
the power of positive thinking.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.680
Or negative thinking.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.180
Whatever we put our
minds to, we can achieve!

03:12.180 --> 03:16.530
All it takes is focus,
determination, hard work,

03:16.530 --> 03:19.520
and our ferocious dragon genes of course.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.100
- Oh...
- What's the matter Grus?

03:22.100 --> 03:25.290
- I don't own a pair of jeans, Draco.

03:25.290 --> 03:28.160
- Not jeans, genes!

03:28.160 --> 03:30.350
- Um, I'm confused.

03:30.350 --> 03:32.550
- Hey, I have an idea.

03:32.550 --> 03:35.743
Have you ever heard of the
mighty dragon, Lacerta?

03:36.643 --> 03:37.700
- Lacerta?

03:37.700 --> 03:40.990
That savage dragon warrior from ages ago?

03:40.990 --> 03:42.750
- Yep.
- Who led our town's

03:42.750 --> 03:45.370
dragons against a horde of rival tribes?

03:45.370 --> 03:49.630
Emerging victorious, in
battle, time and time again?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.930
- That's the one.
- Who was banished from

03:51.930 --> 03:55.470
our town forever, with the
power of a magic spell,

03:55.470 --> 03:59.860
for being conniving, and
deceitful in the eyes of the king?

03:59.860 --> 04:02.000
- Hey, you can't win 'em all.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.521
I see you're familiar with his tales.

04:04.521 --> 04:07.020
- (gasps) He has more than one tail?

04:07.020 --> 04:10.360
- No no no Grus, he only has one!

04:10.360 --> 04:12.130
That's not my point.

04:12.130 --> 04:15.870
My point is it's possible
that a dragon like Lacerta

04:15.870 --> 04:18.730
could help two Pixy
Dragons like you and me,

04:18.730 --> 04:21.238
win that Fire Breathing Contest!

04:21.238 --> 04:22.120
- Us?

04:22.120 --> 04:24.390
Win the Fire Breathing Contest?

04:24.390 --> 04:26.010
That's crazy!

04:26.010 --> 04:28.680
- Crazier stuff has happened, has it not?

04:28.680 --> 04:30.210
- Uh...

04:30.210 --> 04:32.680
- Like Marly the Maltese Dragon,

04:32.680 --> 04:35.750
nose-diving into that
erupting volcano last year,

04:35.750 --> 04:37.700
and emerging without a mark on her!

04:37.700 --> 04:41.290
- That was crazy!
- And Vin the Varmint

04:41.290 --> 04:43.250
herding those stampeding wildebeests

04:43.250 --> 04:45.890
through the town fair all by himself,

04:45.890 --> 04:48.660
without a single soul getting hurt!

04:48.660 --> 04:50.650
- That was crazy too!

04:50.650 --> 04:52.910
- You see Grus, crazy things

04:52.910 --> 04:56.400
happen all the time, so
us winning that contest

04:56.400 --> 04:58.580
isn't so crazy after all, is it?

04:58.580 --> 05:01.970
- It's still pretty crazy Draco,

05:01.970 --> 05:05.093
I mean right now I couldn't
breath fire if I had to.

05:05.093 --> 05:07.330
How can I expect to get up,

05:07.330 --> 05:09.470
and beat thousand year
old dragons who've been

05:09.470 --> 05:11.490
doing it all their lives?

05:11.490 --> 05:14.560
- Where there's a will
Grus, there's a way!

05:14.560 --> 05:16.303
- How would we even find Lacerta?

05:16.303 --> 05:18.140
What if he's old and sick?

05:18.140 --> 05:21.340
Or, what if he's, you know.

05:21.340 --> 05:25.560
- Dragons like Lacerta don't
just lie down and die, Grus.

05:25.560 --> 05:29.840
They bide their time,
watching and waiting,

05:29.840 --> 05:32.870
for the perfect moment to
re-emerge from their lairs,

05:32.870 --> 05:36.540
and strike with savage
force and furious venom!

05:36.540 --> 05:38.260
- Yikes!
- Come on,

05:38.260 --> 05:40.812
there's no time to waste!

05:40.812 --> 05:43.312
(tense music)

05:46.172 --> 05:48.672
(crow cawing)

05:56.080 --> 05:58.240
- Hey guys, what's up?

05:58.240 --> 06:00.950
- We are, in just a little while.

06:00.950 --> 06:03.700
We're going on an exciting trip!

06:03.700 --> 06:06.070
- Oh yeah, you're not gonna stick around

06:06.070 --> 06:09.560
to see the Fire Breathing
Contest next week?

06:09.560 --> 06:12.010
- Oh we'll be back in time for that Leo.

06:12.010 --> 06:14.970
We'll be back in plenty of time for that.

06:14.970 --> 06:17.604
- Yeah, we gotta be there to win.

06:17.604 --> 06:19.600
- Win (chuckles)?

06:19.600 --> 06:22.690
You guys are as funny as ever.

06:22.690 --> 06:24.847
- There's nothing funny about it Leo,

06:24.847 --> 06:26.350
(crow cawing)
Grus and me are gonna enter

06:26.350 --> 06:30.620
that Fire Breathing Contest,
and we're gonna win!

06:30.620 --> 06:33.780
- But neither one of
you has even mustered up

06:33.780 --> 06:35.348
a fire burp before!

06:35.348 --> 06:36.870
(crow cawing)
None of us have.

06:36.870 --> 06:38.610
We're still little!

06:38.610 --> 06:40.220
- It doesn't matter!

06:40.220 --> 06:41.610
- Sure it does!

06:41.610 --> 06:46.240
Lita breaths fire clear over
the snowy mountain peaks!

06:46.240 --> 06:50.270
You're gonna learn how to
do that by next Wednesday?

06:50.270 --> 06:54.170
- Maybe!
- Ha, I'd like to see you try!

06:54.170 --> 06:56.740
- You'll see more than that little Leo!

06:56.740 --> 07:00.400
Just sit back, and enjoy
the show on Wednesday!

07:00.400 --> 07:03.340
We have a surprise coach
who's gonna help teach us

07:03.340 --> 07:06.580
everything we need to
know about breathing fire!

07:06.580 --> 07:09.170
- Yeah, and we're gonna
wipe out the competition,

07:09.170 --> 07:13.230
and claim first prize,
lickity split, I hope!

07:13.230 --> 07:16.560
- Who's your coach?
- It's top secret,

07:16.560 --> 07:19.080
you can't tell anybody!

07:19.080 --> 07:20.820
- Your secret's safe with me!

07:20.820 --> 07:23.800
When have I ever ratted you guys out?

07:23.800 --> 07:26.020
- You told Scalington, when I stapled

07:26.020 --> 07:29.160
Dopple's tail to the seat in band camp.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.040
- Besides that.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.120
- Oh, um...

07:33.120 --> 07:35.080
- We're going to find Lacerta,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.330
so he can train us in all the ways

07:37.330 --> 07:39.834
of fire breathing dragons!

07:39.834 --> 07:40.667
- Lacerta?

07:41.510 --> 07:42.580
- Yep!

07:42.580 --> 07:47.580
- Evil Lacerta, the dragon who
betrayed our king long ago?

07:47.770 --> 07:50.600
- How do you know he's evil?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.160
- The stories!

07:52.160 --> 07:53.720
We all grew up on them!

07:53.720 --> 07:56.420
My mom used to tell me Lacerta stories

07:56.420 --> 08:00.432
when I wanted to hear something
spooky around the campfire.

08:00.432 --> 08:03.563
- (hisses) Stories-shmories.
(crow cawing)

08:03.563 --> 08:06.580
Do you always believe everything you hear?

08:06.580 --> 08:10.440
- About Lacerta, yes
because everybody tells

08:10.440 --> 08:14.322
the same ones, so there
must be some truth to 'em.

08:14.322 --> 08:16.920
- You sound gullible to us.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.510
- Yeah, gullible.

08:18.510 --> 08:22.500
- I don't even think you should
go anywhere near Lacerta!

08:22.500 --> 08:24.522
If he's even still around here.

08:24.522 --> 08:26.060
(crow cawing)
Nobody's seen him

08:26.060 --> 08:28.590
in a long time.

08:28.590 --> 08:32.020
- Well then, we'll find out, won't we,

08:32.020 --> 08:34.480
and when we're fire breathing champions,

08:34.480 --> 08:36.620
you and all your little buddies will be

08:36.620 --> 08:37.870
singing a different tune!

08:38.880 --> 08:40.049
- Yeah?

08:40.049 --> 08:43.580
Do you think we'll know
the tune too, Draco?

08:43.580 --> 08:45.390
- Grus!
- I mean,

08:45.390 --> 08:46.850
I'll feel a little bit dumb if

08:46.850 --> 08:48.930
everyone's singing but me.

08:48.930 --> 08:51.670
- Let it go Grus.
- Okay.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.720
- Leo, you're just jealous
of our plan because you

08:54.720 --> 08:56.157
didn't think of it.
(crow cawing)

08:56.157 --> 08:59.490
But that's okay, after we win the contest

08:59.490 --> 09:01.410
I'll be more than happy to teach you

09:01.410 --> 09:03.710
everything I've learned!

09:03.710 --> 09:06.507
Then maybe you can win next year (laughs)!

09:08.280 --> 09:10.110
- Unless we enter again.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.210
- Well yeah, duh!

09:12.210 --> 09:14.490
In that case, we'll be back-to-back

09:14.490 --> 09:16.940
fire breathing champions!

09:16.940 --> 09:19.330
- Okay, but maybe we'll sit out.

09:19.330 --> 09:20.770
- Maybe our endorsements,

09:20.770 --> 09:22.986
will have us flying around the world,

09:22.986 --> 09:26.610
doing interviews, shooting commercials!

09:26.610 --> 09:29.820
- Being hounded by
paparazzi wearing disguises,

09:29.820 --> 09:31.930
hiding behind body guards!

09:31.930 --> 09:35.520
- You guys have your heads in the clouds!

09:35.520 --> 09:37.320
- That's right we do!

09:37.320 --> 09:41.520
Come on Grus, we have a fire
breathing dragon to meet!

09:41.520 --> 09:43.940
- Okay!
- Later loser!

09:43.940 --> 09:45.743
See ya next Wednesday!

09:47.870 --> 09:50.484
- Psst, whatever.
(crow cawing)

09:50.484 --> 09:53.314
(tense music)

09:53.314 --> 09:56.064
(resolute music)

10:19.421 --> 10:22.254
(energetic music)

10:52.066 --> 10:54.566
(crow cawing)

10:57.690 --> 11:00.763
- Dragon breaths, I've
never flown so far Draco!

11:00.763 --> 11:03.900
I've never been this far
away from Dragon Town either!

11:03.900 --> 11:04.763
I'm beat!

11:05.620 --> 11:08.026
- Let's take a minute to rest, Grus.

11:08.026 --> 11:09.740
(crow cawing)
We can use this lighthouse

11:09.740 --> 11:11.810
as a marker on our path.

11:11.810 --> 11:15.280
It can be seen for miles and miles around.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.300
So no matter which way we go,

11:17.300 --> 11:19.340
we'll never lose sight of it!

11:19.340 --> 11:21.180
- Wow, smart!
(crow cawing)

11:21.180 --> 11:22.610
- I know, right?

11:22.610 --> 11:26.030
Dragons from all over the
world will probably write

11:26.030 --> 11:28.610
after I win the Fire Breathing Contest,

11:28.610 --> 11:31.300
just to ask me important questions!

11:31.300 --> 11:32.853
- You mean us.
- What?

11:33.740 --> 11:34.573
- Us.

11:34.573 --> 11:36.690
Dragons from all over
the world will write us

11:36.690 --> 11:38.740
to ask important questions,

11:38.740 --> 11:41.220
because we're gonna tie, remember?

11:41.220 --> 11:44.590
- Oh, yeah of course,
we're both gonna win.

11:44.590 --> 11:47.800
It's gonna be a tie, the best friends,

11:47.800 --> 11:50.913
and the best fire breathers
Dragon Town's ever known!

11:51.785 --> 11:55.080
- (laughs) That sounds
too good to be true.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.940
- But is is true Grus, it is!

11:57.940 --> 12:02.260
All we gotta do is find Lacerta,
and explain our situation,

12:02.260 --> 12:05.250
and I'm sure he'll be
as excited as we are.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.370
- Gosh I sure hope so!

12:07.370 --> 12:10.430
- Brighten up my friend, come on,

12:10.430 --> 12:12.751
let's go further up the coast.

12:12.751 --> 12:14.340
(crow cawing)
Lacerta's lair is surely

12:14.340 --> 12:17.730
up North, and I'd like
to find it by morning!

12:17.730 --> 12:19.910
- Okay.
- The quicker we get

12:19.910 --> 12:23.030
Lacerta on our side,
the quicker we'll become

12:23.030 --> 12:25.951
the grown-up legends we were meant to be!

12:25.951 --> 12:29.343
- Yeah!
- Okay, here we go!

12:30.270 --> 12:31.970
- Uh Draco?

12:31.970 --> 12:33.610
- Yes Grus, what is it?

12:33.610 --> 12:36.240
- Can I rest a little bit longer?

12:36.240 --> 12:38.190
- Fine, hurry it up though.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.160
We're wasting time!

12:40.160 --> 12:41.653
- I'm hungry, I'm hungry!

12:43.186 --> 12:45.330
(crow cawing)

12:45.330 --> 12:47.830
(tense music)

12:51.805 --> 12:54.720
(crow cawing)

12:54.720 --> 12:57.098
- Hi there Pixy Dragon.

12:57.098 --> 12:59.200
Who might you be?

12:59.200 --> 13:00.963
- Yeah we've never seen you before.

13:00.963 --> 13:03.940
We flew all the way from Dragon Town.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.920
- Dragon Town, what's that?

13:05.920 --> 13:09.370
- Wow, you've never heard of Dragon Town?

13:09.370 --> 13:12.880
File another one under crazy stuff, Draco.

13:12.880 --> 13:13.910
- No doubt.

13:13.910 --> 13:17.000
Dragon Town is where most
all the dragons we know

13:17.000 --> 13:18.830
were born and raised!

13:18.830 --> 13:22.150
- It's way back down the
coastline, super far!

13:22.150 --> 13:23.800
You got to be one rugged dragon

13:23.800 --> 13:25.190
to make the trip.
(crow cawing)

13:25.190 --> 13:26.280
Or two.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.630
And both of us are pretty rugged.

13:28.630 --> 13:31.740
- Oh, well, good for you.

13:31.740 --> 13:35.630
- I'm Draco, and this is my buddy, Grus.

13:35.630 --> 13:36.640
What's your name?

13:36.640 --> 13:38.626
- I'm Pixypaw.

13:38.626 --> 13:42.540
- (chuckles) Pixypaw, that's a dumb name.

13:42.540 --> 13:45.260
- Oh...
- (chuckles) Don't listen

13:45.260 --> 13:48.480
to my friend, he has bad manners.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.470
You're name's not dumb, it's just weird.

13:51.470 --> 13:56.277
- Oh, I guess Draco and Grunts
aren't weird at all then.

13:56.277 --> 13:57.110
- Uh...

13:58.098 --> 14:00.090
- (chuckles) Good point.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.310
I guess we're all kind of weird.

14:02.310 --> 14:04.437
I like you Pixypaw,

14:04.437 --> 14:06.950
you want to hang with us and be friends?

14:06.950 --> 14:08.120
- I don't know.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.940
What are you two doing out here and,

14:09.940 --> 14:11.370
where are you going?

14:11.370 --> 14:12.940
- We're in training.

14:12.940 --> 14:15.620
- Yeah, on a top secret mission.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.550
- Training on a top secret mission?

14:17.550 --> 14:18.970
That sound exciting.

14:18.970 --> 14:20.330
- Totally!

14:20.330 --> 14:22.330
- Excitement's our middle name.

14:22.330 --> 14:25.680
- Uh, mine's Donny.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.687
- Donny (chuckles)?

14:27.550 --> 14:29.120
Now that's super weird.
(crow cawing)

14:29.120 --> 14:30.720
Can I train too?

14:30.720 --> 14:33.449
- Um, no.

14:33.449 --> 14:34.540
- No?

14:34.540 --> 14:38.070
- No, but you can come
along and cheer us on.

14:38.070 --> 14:39.920
- That's stupid.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.060
Why would I want to fly
off to parts unknown

14:42.060 --> 14:45.390
with a couple of weird strangers
just to cheer for them?

14:45.390 --> 14:47.330
Ra-ra-sis-boomba!

14:47.330 --> 14:50.000
There, now beat it you selfish jerks!

14:50.000 --> 14:53.060
- Wow, you don't take any guff, do you?

14:53.060 --> 14:55.490
- Of course not, I might be a little Pixy,

14:55.490 --> 14:58.290
but I'm a Pixy Dragon
and don't you forget it!

14:58.290 --> 15:01.410
- I like your style, Pixypaw!

15:01.410 --> 15:03.970
I'm gonna let you in on our secret.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.440
- Oh I feel so privileged.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.130
- Wait, what does that word mean?

15:09.130 --> 15:11.330
- We're getting ready for our town's big

15:11.330 --> 15:14.140
upcoming Fire Breathing Contest.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.910
- Only, we've never breathed fire.

15:16.910 --> 15:18.350
- You've never breathed fire,

15:18.350 --> 15:21.370
and you're getting ready for
a fire breathing contest?

15:21.370 --> 15:25.100
- That's right.
- Okay, so you two

15:25.100 --> 15:26.560
are looney toons?

15:26.560 --> 15:28.667
- Does everybody know that tune but me?

15:28.667 --> 15:30.340
I need to hear it!

15:30.340 --> 15:32.600
- What?
- Don't mind him.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.770
We're on our way to see Lacerta,

15:34.770 --> 15:38.160
the famous fire breathing dragon.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.631
He's gonna school us in
the ways of breathing fire.

15:41.631 --> 15:42.850
- Lacerta?

15:42.850 --> 15:44.100
- Yep.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.490
- Yep.
- He told you that?

15:46.490 --> 15:48.920
- Well, not exactly.
(crow cawing)

15:48.920 --> 15:51.540
We're gonna find him, introduce ourselves,

15:51.540 --> 15:54.840
explain our situation, and ask nicely.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.660
- Oh, well, good luck with that.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.840
- What's the matter Pixypaw,

15:59.840 --> 16:02.210
you don't seem excited anymore?

16:02.210 --> 16:04.530
- That's because I'm not.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.380
Lacerta's insane, and mean,

16:07.380 --> 16:09.140
and bad to the bone!

16:09.140 --> 16:12.150
Nobody good can ever come
from dealing with him!

16:12.150 --> 16:13.760
Everybody knows that!

16:13.760 --> 16:16.190
- Everybody except us, apparently.

16:16.190 --> 16:17.300
- That's right,

16:17.300 --> 16:19.100
everybody except you!
(crow cawing)

16:19.100 --> 16:22.080
So save yourselves the
trouble, and turn back now.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.890
That's the lamest plan I've ever heard.

16:24.890 --> 16:28.430
- Oh come on, what are you, five days old?

16:28.430 --> 16:29.630
You're just jealous because you've

16:29.630 --> 16:31.770
never seen greatness before!

16:31.770 --> 16:35.410
Well, take a good look
sister, here it goes!

16:35.410 --> 16:37.600
See ya around, sucker!

16:37.600 --> 16:39.650
(tense music)

16:39.650 --> 16:42.593
- Those two dragons are in
for a whole ton of trouble.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.497
- Wow, is that...

16:50.497 --> 16:52.580
- Excuse us, Mr. Lacerta?

16:55.449 --> 16:59.408
- (growls) Who goes there?

16:59.408 --> 17:02.001
(whimpering)

17:02.001 --> 17:02.834
Ah...

17:04.367 --> 17:06.640
- I think I just swallowed a fire burp!

17:06.640 --> 17:09.440
- Really, that's a start!

17:09.440 --> 17:12.089
- Terror works wonders, I guess.

17:12.089 --> 17:14.385
- What are you two jabbering idiots

17:14.385 --> 17:17.277
(crow cawing)
doing at my castle?

17:17.277 --> 17:19.390
Are you lost?

17:19.390 --> 17:24.390
- No Mr. Lacerta, we're not
lost, we came to speak with you.

17:24.935 --> 17:26.270
(chuckling)

17:26.270 --> 17:27.880
- With me?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.914
You expect me to believe that?

17:30.914 --> 17:35.787
No one has been fool enough
to approach me in 300 years!

17:36.920 --> 17:38.690
- We're fool enough!

17:38.690 --> 17:42.300
- That's right sir, we're complete fools!

17:42.300 --> 17:43.742
- Completely.

17:43.742 --> 17:47.617
- (growls) The line between
foolishness and bravery

17:47.617 --> 17:49.170
has always been thin.

17:49.170 --> 17:53.805
Tell me then, fools, why
have you come to speak,

17:53.805 --> 17:55.664
with Lacerta?

17:55.664 --> 17:58.663
- W-W-We want to, humbly
ask for your help.

17:59.754 --> 18:00.587
- My help?

18:02.365 --> 18:03.800
(growls)

18:03.800 --> 18:06.817
And what have you brought
to appease me, fools?

18:07.725 --> 18:09.350
(crow cawing)
- Appease?

18:09.350 --> 18:10.834
What does that mean?

18:10.834 --> 18:15.667
- (hisses) We didn't bring anything, sir.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.730
(growling)

18:19.730 --> 18:23.860
Okay, okay, we're not here
to fight with you Lacerta!

18:23.860 --> 18:26.200
We couldn't even if we tried!

18:26.200 --> 18:29.510
- That's right!
- Just grant us the mercy

18:29.510 --> 18:32.770
to plead our case, mighty dragon,

18:32.770 --> 18:35.260
then do as you wish.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.470
- Within reason, as you wish.

18:37.470 --> 18:39.060
Within reason.

18:39.060 --> 18:40.931
- You're wasting my time,

18:40.931 --> 18:43.730
(dramatic music)
peons, make it quick.

18:43.730 --> 18:45.123
- Yikes!

18:45.123 --> 18:46.270
- (stammers) Okay here,

18:46.270 --> 18:49.750
uh, so your old town is holding

18:49.750 --> 18:52.200
a big Fire Breathing Contest.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.860
(perky music)

19:03.690 --> 19:05.170
- Hi Mylo.

19:05.170 --> 19:06.003
- Hi Mika.

19:06.003 --> 19:07.380
What's going on today?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.250
- Not much, just thinking about that

19:09.250 --> 19:12.360
Fire Breathing Contest
that Argon announced.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.750
What fun it sounds like!

19:14.750 --> 19:15.680
- I know right?

19:15.680 --> 19:17.680
We'll get to see many
dragons from our town

19:17.680 --> 19:19.020
showing what they can do.

19:19.020 --> 19:22.170
I hear Miss Winger can
spit spinning fireballs!

19:22.170 --> 19:27.170
- And I heard Mr. Hatch can
blow bonafide fire rockets!

19:27.370 --> 19:29.520
- Whoa, that's gnarly!

19:29.520 --> 19:31.540
- I wonder who's gonna win?

19:31.540 --> 19:32.860
- It's so exciting!

19:32.860 --> 19:34.250
When it's all said and done,

19:34.250 --> 19:37.370
who's the best fire breather
in Dragon Town gonna be?

19:37.370 --> 19:39.650
- Have you given any thought to entering?

19:39.650 --> 19:40.483
- Me?

19:40.483 --> 19:43.370
Nah, dragons like us are too little.

19:43.370 --> 19:44.800
- We're not that little!

19:44.800 --> 19:47.360
- Have you ever breathed fire, Mika?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.490
- Well, not really.

19:49.490 --> 19:51.270
- See.
- But,

19:51.270 --> 19:54.960
I had a smoke curl come
out of my nostril once.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.650
- Um...

19:56.650 --> 19:58.770
On purpose or by accident?

19:58.770 --> 20:00.260
- By accident.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.260
- Accidents don't count.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.790
- But smoke means fire, right?

20:04.790 --> 20:08.420
- No, fire means fire, smoke's just smoke.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.420
Unless we can harness
it and perform at will,

20:10.420 --> 20:13.040
we won't even get to
the talent eliminations!

20:13.040 --> 20:15.410
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

20:15.410 --> 20:17.710
I don't know what I was even thinking.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.970
We're probably still years away from

20:19.970 --> 20:22.340
even spitting fireballs.

20:22.340 --> 20:24.050
- But if that competition's a hit,

20:24.050 --> 20:25.710
and they start holding it every year,

20:25.710 --> 20:29.230
we can enter when we're
older, and maybe even win!

20:29.230 --> 20:33.000
- Ha, that would be so wild!

20:33.000 --> 20:34.760
Imagine the attention you'd get,

20:34.760 --> 20:37.080
and all the new friends you'd make!

20:37.080 --> 20:38.990
- Not to mention the personal reward.

20:38.990 --> 20:40.800
That's the most important thing.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.610
There's probably nothing
better than setting your

20:42.610 --> 20:45.080
mind to something, then seeing it through.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.750
- Yeah, imagine it.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.480
Ladies and gentledragons,

20:49.480 --> 20:52.490
please give a warm round
of applause to your

20:52.490 --> 20:56.853
new Dragon Town fire
breathing champion, Mylo!

20:59.646 --> 21:01.610
- Or, put your wings together for the best

21:01.610 --> 21:05.010
fire breather in town,
our good friend, Mika!

21:06.390 --> 21:08.640
(laughing)

21:11.006 --> 21:13.756
(resolute music)

21:18.296 --> 21:21.070
(tense music)

21:21.070 --> 21:23.993
- So, let me get this straight.

21:24.980 --> 21:29.980
Dragon Town plans to crown
a fire breathing king,

21:30.120 --> 21:34.603
while the great Lacerta still
dwells in the hills, nearby.

21:36.230 --> 21:41.230
- Well, not a king, no,
it's just a contest.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.710
- What is the meaning

21:43.710 --> 21:45.600
of a contest?
(crow cawing)

21:45.600 --> 21:49.600
- It's like a competition,
a test of talent.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.580
A game with a winner.

21:51.580 --> 21:54.680
- Oh, I see.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.720
- Wow, I just explained the
meaning of a word to somebody.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.720
- Not just somebody, Grus,

22:00.720 --> 22:04.230
you explained it to Lacerta the dragon!

22:04.230 --> 22:05.907
- You're right, ah!

22:05.907 --> 22:08.670
I'm geeking out, I'm geeking way out!

22:08.670 --> 22:12.360
- And you two inconsequential Pixies

22:12.360 --> 22:17.086
would like to learn from
the best fire breather ever,

22:17.086 --> 22:19.140
(crow cawing)
how to craft the

22:19.140 --> 22:24.140
mightiest flame, and
defeat your myriad enemies?

22:24.660 --> 22:29.660
- Uh, well, they're not
really enemies, Lacerta,

22:29.816 --> 22:34.507
more like townsfolk, but
yeah, that's the gist of it.

22:34.507 --> 22:38.570
- (growls) I will help you.

22:38.570 --> 22:39.990
- You will?

22:39.990 --> 22:41.340
- You will?

22:41.340 --> 22:43.523
- Yes, I will.

22:44.547 --> 22:47.930
On one condition.
(suspenseful music)

22:47.930 --> 22:49.160
- Name it!

22:49.160 --> 22:50.420
- Anything!

22:50.420 --> 22:52.580
- Not, most things.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.030
- Most things, lots of things.

22:55.030 --> 22:57.820
- Lots, but not anything.

22:57.820 --> 22:59.930
- No, lots is good.

22:59.930 --> 23:02.183
- Hmm, very.

23:03.331 --> 23:06.669
- You will lead me back to Dragon Town,

23:06.669 --> 23:10.200
as your guest, so that I may view

23:10.200 --> 23:14.100
your fire breathing performances.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.460
- Oh, (scoffs), yeah.

23:16.460 --> 23:19.730
- Absolutely, no problem big guy!

23:19.730 --> 23:21.960
- Done!
- Excellent.

23:21.960 --> 23:26.170
The punishment spell that
cast me out so long ago,

23:26.170 --> 23:30.120
dictates that I am
forever unable to return,

23:30.120 --> 23:34.008
and may not breach the town's borders,

23:34.008 --> 23:38.180
unless accompanied by a citizen who

23:38.180 --> 23:41.030
willingly leads me back in.

23:41.030 --> 23:42.000
- Really?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.630
Huh.
- Well, consider yourself

23:44.630 --> 23:46.080
with us, buddy!

23:46.080 --> 23:48.888
- Yeah, it's great to know you, Lacerta.

23:48.888 --> 23:53.310
- Likewise, Pixies, likewise.

23:53.310 --> 23:55.580
- We've heard so much
about you growing up.

23:55.580 --> 23:58.300
It's awesome to find out,
that that big old dragon's

23:58.300 --> 24:00.393
even cooler than we imagined in person!

24:01.269 --> 24:03.830
- Grus, I think this
could be the beginning

24:03.830 --> 24:06.550
of a beautiful friendship,

24:06.550 --> 24:10.900
and a new fire breathing champion!

24:10.900 --> 24:14.620
- Two new fire breathing
champions Draco, two!

24:14.620 --> 24:18.607
- Ha ha, yes, two, tied
for the best (laughs).

24:20.317 --> 24:22.984
(Grus laughing)

24:24.208 --> 24:26.708
(perky music)

24:29.270 --> 24:31.590
- Hey Mika, Mylo!

24:31.590 --> 24:34.000
- Hey Leo.
- Hey Leo.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.420
- Are you two planning to enter the

24:35.420 --> 24:37.830
Fire Breathing Contest too?

24:37.830 --> 24:39.950
- Us, we talked about it.

24:39.950 --> 24:41.920
- But we think we might be too little.

24:41.920 --> 24:44.870
- Yeah, maybe next year.

24:44.870 --> 24:48.140
- Oh so you don't have a
crazy plan under your wings,

24:48.140 --> 24:52.090
like some other pixy dragons around here.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.690
- Who are you talking about?

24:53.690 --> 24:57.260
- I'm talking about those
two sparkler spitters,

24:57.260 --> 24:59.640
Draco and Grus.

24:59.640 --> 25:00.750
- Draco and Grus?

25:00.750 --> 25:02.560
What are they up to this time?

25:02.560 --> 25:05.420
- You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.270
- Oh no, try us?

25:08.270 --> 25:10.730
- They're gonna enter the
Fire Breathing Contest

25:10.730 --> 25:14.000
and try to win it, with
somebody else's help.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.300
- With somebody else's help?

25:15.300 --> 25:16.880
Nobody could teach two dragon's

25:16.880 --> 25:18.590
who've never breathed fire to breath

25:18.590 --> 25:21.750
better than every dragon
in town by Wednesday!

25:21.750 --> 25:24.410
- Yeah, nobody could do that!

25:24.410 --> 25:25.883
- Nobody except Lacerta!

25:27.169 --> 25:28.687
- Lacerta?

25:28.687 --> 25:32.133
- Lacerta?
- The one and only.

25:32.133 --> 25:33.460
(crow cawing)
- But, is he

25:33.460 --> 25:35.450
even still around these parts?

25:35.450 --> 25:37.660
That was so long ago.

25:37.660 --> 25:40.052
- Our parents told stories about Lacerta.

25:40.052 --> 25:42.170
- And our grandparents.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.100
- [Mylo] And our great grandparents.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.020
- And our great, great--

25:46.020 --> 25:47.450
- You get the idea.

25:47.450 --> 25:51.610
- Yeah well Draco and Grus flew
off to find him last night.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.520
- Are you serious?

25:53.520 --> 25:57.060
- How could they be so dumb,
that's a terrible idea!

25:57.060 --> 25:58.447
- I tried telling them that

25:58.447 --> 26:00.360
but they didn't want to listen.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.600
Whoosh, off they went.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.420
- Do they know where he is?

26:04.420 --> 26:07.570
- I don't think anybody knows where he is,

26:07.570 --> 26:09.300
or if he's even still out there,

26:09.300 --> 26:12.360
but if he is, they'll know soon enough.

26:12.360 --> 26:15.363
You don't find Lacerta, he finds you!

26:16.458 --> 26:19.190
- Jeesh, I've never gotten
along with those guys,

26:19.190 --> 26:20.860
but I hope they're okay.

26:20.860 --> 26:23.160
- Yeah, hopefully they'll both come home

26:23.160 --> 26:26.642
in one piece and chalk it
up to a lesson learned.

26:26.642 --> 26:30.750
- We'll see but you know,
I was giving some thought

26:30.750 --> 26:34.233
to what they said, and
what if their plan works?

26:35.151 --> 26:37.651
(crow cawing)

26:42.969 --> 26:45.719
(birds chirping)

26:49.330 --> 26:52.310
- Hey hey Pixy Dragons, how
are those wings flapping?

26:52.310 --> 26:53.810
- How's it going Lily?

26:53.810 --> 26:55.380
- What you been up to, Lily?

26:55.380 --> 26:58.080
- I've been reading a lot, I love to read.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.200
- Oh yeah, what are you reading now?

27:00.200 --> 27:01.870
- I'm almost finished
with this book about a

27:01.870 --> 27:04.150
daydreaming dragon who
runs away from home,

27:04.150 --> 27:05.930
and ends up finding this mythical monster

27:05.930 --> 27:07.290
on a mountaintop!

27:07.290 --> 27:09.670
- Wow, what's the name of the book?

27:09.670 --> 27:12.150
- The Daydreaming Dragon
Who Ran Away From Home,

27:12.150 --> 27:14.800
Versus a Mythical
Monster on a Mountaintop.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.890
- Ah, I should have known.

27:16.890 --> 27:20.020
- It's real good, you want
to borrow it when I'm done?

27:20.020 --> 27:21.420
- Yeah, maybe.

27:21.420 --> 27:23.750
- What brings you guys
over to my side of town?

27:23.750 --> 27:26.850
Are you going to the fire
breathing talent eliminations?

27:26.850 --> 27:30.150
- Oh, are they happening right now?

27:30.150 --> 27:31.270
- They sure are.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.840
You just gotta talk to
Argon and get your slot.

27:33.840 --> 27:36.520
- Hmm, that's odd, we've
never hung out over here.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.540
It's almost like we were meant

27:37.540 --> 27:39.690
to run into that talent eliminator.

27:39.690 --> 27:43.340
- Yeah, what do you think, should we?

27:43.340 --> 27:45.600
- It's not like we have anything to lose.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.960
- Worse that could happen
is we embarrass ourselves

27:47.960 --> 27:51.126
by trying to blow fire and
just burping or something.

27:51.126 --> 27:52.440
(bell ringing)
- It's not like anyone

27:52.440 --> 27:55.220
would expect two Pixy Dragons our size

27:55.220 --> 27:56.980
to breath fire anyway.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.190
- That's right.

27:58.190 --> 28:00.950
- You should go for it, who
knows what might happen?

28:00.950 --> 28:03.540
- On the other wing, if we don't try,

28:03.540 --> 28:05.220
we know nothing will happen.

28:05.220 --> 28:08.080
- That's right, take a
chance, live a little.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.133
- Thanks Lily!
- Good luck!

28:12.260 --> 28:14.780
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

28:14.780 --> 28:17.228
(bell ringing)

28:17.228 --> 28:19.478
(snarling)

28:21.720 --> 28:25.320
- [Draco] Here we are
Lacerta, home sweet home.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.480
- [Grus] We're here now.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.260
You finally have friends.

28:28.260 --> 28:30.415
Welcome home, Lacerta!

28:30.415 --> 28:33.980
- [Draco] Yeah, (speaking
foreign language).

28:33.980 --> 28:35.720
- [Grus] Uh, what?

28:35.720 --> 28:39.626
- [Draco] Still not paying
attention in Spanish Class I see.

28:39.626 --> 28:41.578
(cheering)
(applauding)

28:41.578 --> 28:44.328
(pleasant music)

28:47.050 --> 28:50.710
- Hello, ladies and gentledragons, hello!

28:50.710 --> 28:53.240
And welcome to the official Dragon Town

28:53.240 --> 28:55.960
fire breathing talent eliminations.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.420
I am you Mayor Argon, and I will be the

28:58.420 --> 29:01.340
Master of Ceremonies for this afternoon,

29:01.340 --> 29:04.370
full of skilled, and
perhaps not so skilled

29:04.370 --> 29:07.180
displays of fire exhalations.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.590
This is it, hit us with your best shots,

29:09.590 --> 29:14.510
and today's result will determine
whether you place or pass,

29:14.510 --> 29:18.070
in Wednesday's historic
First Annual Dragon Town

29:18.070 --> 29:19.980
Fire Breathing Challenge!

29:19.980 --> 29:23.923
Now without further ado, away we go!

29:25.677 --> 29:28.280
(chattering)
(birds chirping)

29:28.280 --> 29:32.420
Firstly, I have something
very special to tell you all.

29:32.420 --> 29:35.250
I ran into this young
pixy on the way over here,

29:35.250 --> 29:38.840
and can proudly say, that I
was privileged to witness,

29:38.840 --> 29:41.143
her very first ever, fire breath.

29:42.590 --> 29:46.230
She did a marvelous job,
and for one so young,

29:46.230 --> 29:48.600
I know there's much more in store.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.870
I can't wait to see what
she shows us on Wednesday.

29:51.870 --> 29:55.377
Let's get her out her, Mika, come on out!

29:55.377 --> 29:57.086
(chattering)

29:57.086 --> 29:58.402
(crickets chirping)
(birds chirping)

29:58.402 --> 30:01.402
(suspenseful music)

30:04.640 --> 30:09.620
- Um, hi everybody, my name's Mika, and,

30:09.620 --> 30:14.307
um, well, I'm here to breath fire!

30:14.307 --> 30:17.010
(chattering)

30:17.010 --> 30:19.020
Thank you, thank you.

30:19.020 --> 30:22.680
Okay, whew, sorry, one second.

30:22.680 --> 30:26.342
This is like, my second ever try.

30:26.342 --> 30:31.259
(fiery roaring)
(cheering)

30:34.330 --> 30:38.250
- All right, let's hear
it for little Mika!

30:38.250 --> 30:40.010
Second fire ever!

30:40.010 --> 30:42.050
What a fine young dragon!

30:42.050 --> 30:43.863
Thank you for sharing, Mika!

30:44.820 --> 30:47.060
Well how's that for talent?

30:47.060 --> 30:50.620
I'm telling you, Dragon Town
has some of the very best

30:50.620 --> 30:53.470
fire breathers anywhere on this planet!

30:53.470 --> 30:56.310
I kid you not, we start 'em young here,

30:56.310 --> 30:57.913
we start 'em young!

30:59.500 --> 31:03.760
Okay, next up, please lend
a warm winged welcome,

31:03.760 --> 31:05.980
for Mika's best buddy.

31:05.980 --> 31:07.900
Some of you may know this little guy

31:07.900 --> 31:10.850
from the morning paper route last year.

31:10.850 --> 31:12.597
Give it up for, Mylo!

31:13.782 --> 31:16.314
(cheering)
(applauding)

31:16.314 --> 31:19.314
(suspenseful music)

31:26.040 --> 31:28.210
- Hi everybody, I'm Mylo,

31:28.210 --> 31:30.040
this is my second ever fire too!

31:30.040 --> 31:30.873
I hope.

31:32.025 --> 31:34.775
(flames roaring)

31:38.604 --> 31:40.231
(cheering)
- Woo hoo!

31:40.231 --> 31:42.077
Woo hoo, yeah!

31:42.077 --> 31:45.015
Fire, smoke, she's a-rising!

31:45.015 --> 31:47.515
(tense music)

32:01.344 --> 32:03.160
(growling)

32:03.160 --> 32:05.910
(flames roaring)

32:08.877 --> 32:11.627
(flames roaring)

32:15.367 --> 32:18.710
(snarling)
- Hello again,

32:18.710 --> 32:20.663
Dragon Town!
(bell ringing)

32:20.663 --> 32:24.300
For those of you who do not know who I am,

32:24.300 --> 32:27.020
allow me to introduce myself!

32:27.020 --> 32:28.400
I am Lacerta!

32:29.720 --> 32:32.600
Also known as the Boogie Dragon,

32:32.600 --> 32:36.933
the Thing in the Shadows, and
the Monster Under the Bed!

32:38.166 --> 32:40.333
You're all my dragons now!

32:43.360 --> 32:48.277
(laughing)
(bell ringing)

32:51.021 --> 32:54.100
(flames roaring)
(snarling)

32:54.100 --> 32:56.410
- Oh no, Draco, and Grus!

32:57.510 --> 32:59.880
What have you two Pixies done?

32:59.880 --> 33:01.864
What have you done?

33:01.864 --> 33:06.864
(dramatic music)
(flames roaring)

33:21.073 --> 33:23.441
(snarling)

33:23.441 --> 33:25.752
(growling)

33:25.752 --> 33:28.830
(Lacerta laughing)

33:28.830 --> 33:33.183
- [Lacerta] That's what I
call, a homecoming party.

33:34.130 --> 33:36.721
- That was unbelievable Lacerta!

33:36.721 --> 33:39.490
The townsdragons were terrified!

33:39.490 --> 33:42.160
- I've never seen them so scared!

33:42.160 --> 33:44.860
- And Argon, did you see his face?

33:44.860 --> 33:47.410
I think his scales turned white!

33:47.410 --> 33:49.891
- He looked like he'd seen a ghost!

33:49.891 --> 33:53.567
- [Lacerta] You two, go
into the countryside,

33:53.567 --> 33:57.443
and locate for me the
Ancient Dragon's Egg.

33:58.330 --> 34:00.900
Bring me the Ancient Egg,

34:00.900 --> 34:04.720
so that I may command
the mightiest dragon army

34:04.720 --> 34:07.770
this world has ever known!

34:07.770 --> 34:10.010
- Then can we practice fire breathing?

34:10.010 --> 34:11.440
- Right away Lacerta!

34:11.440 --> 34:12.540
Here we go!

34:12.540 --> 34:15.120
- Oh my gosh, are you two okay?

34:15.120 --> 34:19.530
- We're fine Luna, it's Dragon
Town we're not so sure about.

34:19.530 --> 34:22.070
- I can't believe those
two jerks actually found

34:22.070 --> 34:24.110
Lacerta and brought him back to our home!

34:24.110 --> 34:26.150
What a stupid thing to do!

34:26.150 --> 34:28.710
- To be honest, Draco and Grus have never

34:28.710 --> 34:31.000
really been known for their smarts.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.860
- That's an understatement.

34:32.860 --> 34:35.010
- What in the world will we do now?

34:35.010 --> 34:37.540
Our dragons are peaceful dragons.

34:37.540 --> 34:41.659
Nobody here is any match
for a monster like Lacerta!

34:41.659 --> 34:43.630
- That's right, must of us grew up hearing

34:43.630 --> 34:45.739
tales of Lacerta's fiery power!

34:45.739 --> 34:47.219
He's frightened our town's residents

34:47.219 --> 34:49.070
for longer than we've been alive!

34:49.070 --> 34:51.820
- Talk about having a psychological edge!

34:51.820 --> 34:55.050
- What if, what if we
had to leave Dragon Town?

34:55.050 --> 34:57.773
- Nonsense Mylo, Dragon Town's our home!

34:58.710 --> 35:00.420
There's no place on this planet that could

35:00.420 --> 35:02.080
ever take its place!

35:02.080 --> 35:04.110
- But if--
- If nothing!

35:04.110 --> 35:08.230
Yes, Lacerta's a big bad
dragon, but we're dragons too!

35:08.230 --> 35:11.810
He has no power that each
of us doesn't also possess.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.480
- I mean, I just learned how to spit fire

35:14.480 --> 35:16.580
a few minutes ago, so...

35:16.580 --> 35:18.700
- Maybe a different level of power.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.350
- Definitely a different level.

35:21.350 --> 35:25.310
- You Pixies listen, I
don't talk much about this,

35:25.310 --> 35:28.200
because well, the past is the past,

35:28.200 --> 35:31.245
but, my grandmother knew Lacerta.

35:31.245 --> 35:32.720
- (gasps) Really?

35:32.720 --> 35:35.220
- Were they like, friends?

35:35.220 --> 35:36.930
- You'd have to ask her.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.080
- Oh.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.090
- The good thing is you can.

35:40.090 --> 35:41.210
- Oh.

35:41.210 --> 35:42.820
- Grandmother Nala's lair is

35:42.820 --> 35:44.850
somewhere out in the countryside.

35:44.850 --> 35:46.690
She doesn't accept many visitors,

35:46.690 --> 35:48.220
because she's an old dragon and she's

35:48.220 --> 35:50.340
preparing to transition into the light,

35:50.340 --> 35:52.910
but if she knew what
Dragon Town was facing,

35:52.910 --> 35:54.560
I'm sure she'd help.

35:54.560 --> 35:58.750
- Your grandma sounds very
cool Luna, but that's crazy!

35:58.750 --> 36:02.610
What could an old dragon
possibly do against Lacerta?

36:02.610 --> 36:05.570
- Grandmother Nala's fire
breathing is more powerful

36:05.570 --> 36:08.010
than any dragon breath on this planet.

36:08.010 --> 36:10.430
- Wow!
- Once upon a time,

36:10.430 --> 36:13.560
she taught Lacerta everything he knows.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.160
- Get out!

36:15.160 --> 36:17.800
- If anyone can stop
him, or instruct us on

36:17.800 --> 36:20.510
how to do it ourselves, it's Nala!

36:20.510 --> 36:22.420
- Can you take us to see her Luna?

36:22.420 --> 36:25.170
- I would, but I'm
babysitting little hatchlings

36:25.170 --> 36:26.620
at their house today.

36:26.620 --> 36:28.910
I'm afraid the trip would
be too much for them,

36:28.910 --> 36:32.220
and I can't leave them here
with Lacerta flying around!

36:32.220 --> 36:35.490
- Right, I remember hearing
the Trapped Alaricon Egg story

36:35.490 --> 36:36.752
when we were little.

36:36.752 --> 36:40.370
- Yeesh, that one still gives
me nightmares to this day!

36:40.370 --> 36:41.410
- What's even worse,

36:41.410 --> 36:44.490
is that Grandmother Nala
said it was all true!

36:44.490 --> 36:46.680
- No way!

36:46.680 --> 36:48.180
- Heebie-jeebies!
(bell ringing)

36:48.180 --> 36:50.830
- You two should go in
search of my grandmother!

36:50.830 --> 36:53.200
Tell her what Lacerta's
doing in Dragon Town,

36:53.200 --> 36:55.530
and she'll help any way she can!

36:55.530 --> 36:57.510
Her telepathy is still strong,

36:57.510 --> 37:00.460
so she'll feel your
presence as you get closer.

37:00.460 --> 37:01.920
- Telepathy?

37:01.920 --> 37:04.570
I'm learning so much
about our species today,

37:04.570 --> 37:06.750
it's blowing my mind a little.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.720
- Me too!
- I'll hold down

37:08.720 --> 37:11.810
the fort here, and make
sure Lacerta doesn't go wild

37:11.810 --> 37:13.530
and burn down our town!

37:13.530 --> 37:16.700
- If he tries Luna, how will you stop him?

37:16.700 --> 37:19.920
- I'm not sure, but
I'll think of something.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.540
- That's all any of us can do.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.060
Time wasting, let's fly!

37:24.060 --> 37:25.820
- Be safe dragon friends!

37:25.820 --> 37:27.023
Pixy speed!

37:28.570 --> 37:33.570
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

37:34.510 --> 37:36.130
- What a slap in the tail!

37:36.130 --> 37:37.960
I can't believe Lacerta!

37:37.960 --> 37:39.367
- What can't you believe, Grus?

37:39.367 --> 37:41.410
- He was supposed to train us in

37:41.410 --> 37:43.490
the way of fire breathing, and help us

37:43.490 --> 37:46.490
win the contest on Wednesday, instead,

37:46.490 --> 37:49.280
he's taking over Dragon Town!

37:49.280 --> 37:53.600
Now, there might not even
be a Fire Breathing Contest.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.690
- We knew the risks when
we decided to go find him.

37:56.690 --> 37:59.220
- Maybe you did, but I didn't.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.120
Why would somebody we ask for help,

38:01.120 --> 38:03.120
turn their wings on us like this?

38:03.120 --> 38:04.910
It doesn't make sense!

38:04.910 --> 38:06.890
- Because he's Lacerta, Grus,

38:06.890 --> 38:10.740
he's a bad dragon and always has been!

38:10.740 --> 38:13.620
We've all heard the stories enough times.

38:13.620 --> 38:15.830
- He's bad, but we're not!

38:15.830 --> 38:17.240
Why wouldn't he help us?

38:17.240 --> 38:19.300
When he used to be just like us?

38:19.300 --> 38:22.480
Even Lacerta was once
a little bitty dragon.

38:22.480 --> 38:25.830
- That was a long time ago.

38:25.830 --> 38:27.090
- I guess you're right.

38:27.090 --> 38:30.220
Maybe he just forgot what
it's like, to be little,

38:30.220 --> 38:32.300
with no fire breathing skills,

38:32.300 --> 38:35.620
and a zillion questions about everything.

38:35.620 --> 38:39.040
- Yeah, or maybe he just doesn't care.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.440
- Or that.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.610
How are we supposed to find
an ancient dragon eggs anyway?

38:43.610 --> 38:45.310
I mean, where do we look,

38:45.310 --> 38:48.320
how do we spot it if we do find it?

38:48.320 --> 38:51.300
- I have no clue Grus, I have no clue.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.880
- I know, what if we start digging?

38:53.880 --> 38:56.390
Ancient stuff's always in the dirt, right?

38:56.390 --> 38:58.300
So, it's gotta be underground.

38:58.300 --> 39:01.570
I'll dig here, you dig there.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.670
- Why do you think we
should dig right here Grus?

39:04.670 --> 39:06.410
- Uh, I don't know.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.100
The soil's the soil, right?

39:08.100 --> 39:11.000
It's the same every
place, just like the sky.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.015
If we dig deep enough, we're
bound to hit something ancient.

39:15.015 --> 39:18.460
- (sighs) Why don't we keep
walking a little further,

39:18.460 --> 39:20.340
see what's up over that next ridge.

39:20.340 --> 39:24.640
Lacerta wouldn't have sent
us out on a wild goose chase.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.660
- I didn't hear him say
anything about geese.

39:27.660 --> 39:30.500
- Have faith Grus, we'll
find this thing and

39:30.500 --> 39:33.130
get back to Dragon Town by nightfall!

39:33.130 --> 39:36.970
Then, once he has his
magic egg, or whatever,

39:36.970 --> 39:39.618
I'll bet we can start our fire training!

39:39.618 --> 39:41.318
- You think?
- Yeah, I kind'a do.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.370
I think.

39:44.370 --> 39:45.330
- Draco?

39:45.330 --> 39:46.650
- Yes, Grus?

39:46.650 --> 39:48.447
- What if Lacerta got mad and,

39:48.447 --> 39:50.983
and there's not a Dragon
Town to go back to?

39:54.370 --> 39:56.680
- [Mylo] Look Mika, it's a dragon like us.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.690
Maybe he knows where to find Nala.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.238
- [Mika] Let's ask him.

40:00.238 --> 40:05.238
(relaxing music)
(birds chirping)

40:05.730 --> 40:08.409
- Hello there, we just
came from Dragon Town.

40:08.409 --> 40:11.540
- Oh, you don't say, I
never would have guessed.

40:11.540 --> 40:13.320
- Yeah, we were born here.

40:13.320 --> 40:16.017
- He's being sarcastic, Mylo.

40:16.017 --> 40:17.460
- Oh.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.290
- Let me guess, you want to practice your

40:19.290 --> 40:22.180
fire breathing on my
natural wood windmill here?

40:22.180 --> 40:24.120
Well, the answer's no.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.870
It's my windmill, and
nobody's burning it down.

40:26.870 --> 40:29.210
Especially, not two Squirt Dragons

40:29.210 --> 40:31.080
practicing their smoke rings.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.910
- We don't want to burn
down your windmill,

40:32.910 --> 40:35.320
we just want to ask you a question.

40:35.320 --> 40:38.840
- Yeah, and we're not Squirt
Dragons, we're Pixy Dragons.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.840
- Well excuse me.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.050
I didn't know there was such a difference.

40:43.050 --> 40:43.883
- There is.

40:43.883 --> 40:46.480
Squirters, are generally
found in the mountain regions,

40:46.480 --> 40:48.470
and they're about half our size.

40:48.470 --> 40:50.800
They're bred smaller so they
can stay low to the ground.

40:50.800 --> 40:51.950
They live in the foliage,

40:51.950 --> 40:53.560
out of sight of the pterodactyls,

40:53.560 --> 40:55.480
and trab-di-laricons.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.400
- Hmph, thanks for the species lesson kid.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.680
- No problem.
- Now scram,

41:00.680 --> 41:03.070
I don't trust you two
this close to my windmill!

41:03.070 --> 41:05.320
I built it with my own claws!

41:05.320 --> 41:08.310
- But, we said we--
- I don't care what you said!

41:08.310 --> 41:09.580
It's Springtime!

41:09.580 --> 41:11.480
There's all this pollen in the air!

41:11.480 --> 41:14.090
One sneeze from you Runt Dragons and poof,

41:14.090 --> 41:16.260
this place could go up in flame!

41:16.260 --> 41:19.140
- We're Pixy Dragons, not Runt Dragons!

41:19.140 --> 41:22.430
- Pixies, Runts or Squirts, who cares?

41:22.430 --> 41:24.590
- We're getting off on the wrong wing.

41:24.590 --> 41:27.811
I'm Mika, and this is my friend Mylo.

41:27.811 --> 41:30.480
- Mika, and Mylo, snappy nicknames.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.860
I am Cyan.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.840
You some kind of traveling
minstrels or something?

41:34.840 --> 41:37.170
- No, we're just two
little Pixies looking for

41:37.170 --> 41:39.030
an old dragon named Nala,

41:39.030 --> 41:41.480
she's our dear friend's grandmother.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.200
And, the baddest fire breathers

41:43.200 --> 41:45.310
these hills have ever seen.

41:45.310 --> 41:46.370
- That too.

41:46.370 --> 41:48.800
Do you know where we might find her lair?

41:48.800 --> 41:49.970
- Nala?

41:49.970 --> 41:52.750
Nada, nobody's seen her in ages.

41:52.750 --> 41:55.370
She might have passed on for all I know.

41:55.370 --> 41:56.383
- Oh.

41:56.383 --> 41:57.600
- Oh.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.120
- I mean, I don't know, who knows?

42:00.120 --> 42:01.650
What are two little ones like you

42:01.650 --> 42:03.720
doing traveling by yourselves out here,

42:03.720 --> 42:06.250
looking for some old dragon anyway?

42:06.250 --> 42:07.480
- We're not sure if you heard,

42:07.480 --> 42:09.360
but Lacerta the dragon reappeared,

42:09.360 --> 42:11.050
and took over Dragon Town.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.268
- Lacerta?

42:12.268 --> 42:14.750
You mean the campfire story character?

42:14.750 --> 42:16.010
- That's him!

42:16.010 --> 42:20.274
Only he's not a campfire
character, he's real!

42:20.274 --> 42:22.040
- (chuckles) Tell me another one!

42:22.040 --> 42:24.000
You two ought to put on a comedy show!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.770
- Cyan, we're not kidding, Lacerta's real,

42:26.770 --> 42:29.320
and he aims to do bad things in our town!

42:29.320 --> 42:30.780
- We love our town,

42:30.780 --> 42:33.440
and all our friends and
loved ones are there.

42:33.440 --> 42:35.620
- They're all in grave danger.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.700
- You sure look like you're serious.

42:37.700 --> 42:40.830
If so, I'd say find Nala right away.

42:40.830 --> 42:42.940
I don't know how real Lacerta is,

42:42.940 --> 42:44.730
but I know Nala's fire breathing

42:44.730 --> 42:47.380
packs the biggest punch
on this whole planet!

42:47.380 --> 42:49.690
She's the fire breather
they're talking about,

42:49.690 --> 42:52.430
when they say "Fire breathing dragon."

42:52.430 --> 42:54.960
If I was going up against
a mythical monster,

42:54.960 --> 42:57.800
I'd want Nala in my corner, no doubt.

42:57.800 --> 42:58.950
- That's reassuring.

42:58.950 --> 43:01.580
Now if we could only find her!

43:01.580 --> 43:04.560
- The hillsides look like a
nice place for a dragon's lair.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.780
Let's go that way.

43:05.780 --> 43:08.080
(sneezing)
- Ah, cover your mouth

43:08.080 --> 43:09.270
when you sneeze, squirt,

43:09.270 --> 43:10.600
and step away from the windmill.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.900
Come on, we talked about this!

43:12.900 --> 43:16.230
- Thank you for your time
Cyan, we're leaving now.

43:16.230 --> 43:18.240
- Yeah, just go wide, okay,

43:18.240 --> 43:20.033
wide around the windmill.

43:20.033 --> 43:25.033
(birds chirping)
(tense music)

43:28.970 --> 43:29.810
- Hi there.

43:29.810 --> 43:33.050
Hey, you guys are Pixy Dragons like me!

43:33.050 --> 43:35.310
- Says who?
- I'm Teddy,

43:35.310 --> 43:36.730
the dock operator.

43:36.730 --> 43:39.160
You guys interested in taking a boat ride?

43:39.160 --> 43:41.760
- Okay.
- Quiet Grus,

43:41.760 --> 43:43.470
I'll handle this.

43:43.470 --> 43:46.180
Where does the boat ride take us, peon?

43:46.180 --> 43:49.160
- Just around the lake and
back, it's a nice ride.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.500
- What's in the lake?

43:50.500 --> 43:52.470
- Uh, water?

43:52.470 --> 43:53.920
- What about ancient stuff?

43:53.920 --> 43:56.750
Are there any ancient
dragon eggs at the bottom?

43:56.750 --> 43:58.300
- Uh, I don't know.

43:58.300 --> 44:00.650
You interested in renting scuba gear?

44:00.650 --> 44:01.910
- Okay.

44:01.910 --> 44:02.923
- Quiet, Grus!

44:03.890 --> 44:08.090
Just what kind of racket are
you running here, trickster?

44:08.090 --> 44:09.250
- Racket?

44:09.250 --> 44:11.090
Oh, you want to play some tennis.

44:11.090 --> 44:12.910
The courts are on the other side.

44:12.910 --> 44:14.200
Would you rather do that?

44:14.200 --> 44:16.840
A match is half the price of a boat.

44:16.840 --> 44:18.120
- Okay.

44:18.120 --> 44:19.654
- Enough, Grus.

44:19.654 --> 44:21.790
(bell ringing)
I said I got this.

44:21.790 --> 44:24.030
- Oh, okay.

44:24.030 --> 44:26.950
- Just what all do you offer here, Teddy?

44:26.950 --> 44:28.040
- Lots of things!

44:28.040 --> 44:31.030
Dragons come from all over to
kick back and (mumbles) here.

44:31.030 --> 44:33.060
Especially this time of year.

44:33.060 --> 44:35.890
We have the boats,
snorkeling and scuba diving,

44:35.890 --> 44:38.820
tennis, badminton, fire
breathing, dragon ball,

44:38.820 --> 44:41.480
rock climbing, zip line,
leg swing, bungee jump,

44:41.480 --> 44:43.960
dragon glide, virtually reality parlor,

44:43.960 --> 44:46.890
spa, sauna, steam room, mineral bath,

44:46.890 --> 44:51.000
hiking trails, tunnel digging,
egg laying, claw painting--

44:51.000 --> 44:54.240
- Whoa whoa whoa, say that last one again.

44:54.240 --> 44:55.270
- Claw painting.

44:55.270 --> 44:56.340
It's real fun.

44:56.340 --> 44:59.780
We have a wide variety
of water soluble colors!

44:59.780 --> 45:02.470
- Not that, the one before.

45:02.470 --> 45:03.850
- Tunnel digging?

45:03.850 --> 45:05.440
- After that.

45:05.440 --> 45:08.345
- Uh, hang on, let me get our brochure.

45:08.345 --> 45:10.790
- You said egg laying!

45:10.790 --> 45:13.280
- Oh, yeah, sometimes I get mixed up!

45:13.280 --> 45:15.160
The egg fields are super fun.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.670
You gotta fly over them though,

45:16.670 --> 45:18.430
there's no landing or walking.

45:18.430 --> 45:21.120
Some of our mom dragons are real crafty,

45:21.120 --> 45:24.195
you never know where those cute
little eggs will be stashed!

45:24.195 --> 45:25.140
- Direct us to these
(bell ringing)

45:25.140 --> 45:27.000
egg fields now!

45:27.000 --> 45:29.810
- Yeah, we're looking
for one in particular.

45:29.810 --> 45:32.230
- Oh, I should add, none of the eggs

45:32.230 --> 45:33.940
are available for adoption.

45:33.940 --> 45:36.330
We only offer the incubating ground.

45:36.330 --> 45:39.660
- Well, I think we already have one here.

45:39.660 --> 45:40.750
- Oh, you do?

45:40.750 --> 45:42.099
What's the name?

45:42.099 --> 45:43.480
- Lacerta.

45:43.480 --> 45:47.710
- Hmm, Lacerta, Lacerta, that doesn't

45:47.710 --> 45:48.950
ring a bell.
(bell ringing)

45:48.950 --> 45:51.750
- Which way to the egg fields, Teddy?

45:51.750 --> 45:52.583
- That-a-way!

45:52.583 --> 45:55.183
(dramatic music)
Remember, no landing!

46:07.415 --> 46:09.410
- Halt, who goes there?

46:09.410 --> 46:11.180
- Nobody but us pixy dragons.

46:11.180 --> 46:12.470
Who might you be cutey pie?

46:12.470 --> 46:14.227
- Oh no you don't!

46:14.227 --> 46:16.431
You don't fly up to my mushroom cottage

46:16.431 --> 46:18.946
and ask me to identify myself for you!

46:18.946 --> 46:21.600
You're the one trespassing on my property!

46:21.600 --> 46:24.900
- We didn't mean to invade
your privacy, little one!

46:24.900 --> 46:27.900
I'm Mika, and this is my friend Mylo.

46:27.900 --> 46:28.733
- Mia's my name.

46:28.733 --> 46:31.940
Now, what are you doing, on my property?

46:31.940 --> 46:32.840
- Hi Mia.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.900
We're kind of far from home and,

46:34.900 --> 46:38.180
well, we don't really
know where we're going.

46:38.180 --> 46:39.580
- Don't know where you're going?

46:39.580 --> 46:41.300
Sounds like you two are in a predicament,

46:41.300 --> 46:43.190
as my daddy used to say.

46:43.190 --> 46:44.827
- Yeah, you might say that.

46:44.827 --> 46:47.380
- And my momma would call it a conundrum.

46:47.380 --> 46:48.670
- That too.

46:48.670 --> 46:50.520
Maybe you can help us.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.320
- We just have a question, and maybe

46:52.320 --> 46:53.910
you know the answer.
(bell ringing)

46:53.910 --> 46:55.000
- I stay off the roads around here,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.550
so don't ask me where anything leads.

46:57.550 --> 46:58.720
What's your question?

46:58.720 --> 47:02.930
- We're looking for an old
dragon lady named Nala.

47:02.930 --> 47:04.150
- Do you know her?

47:04.150 --> 47:04.983
- Nala?

47:04.983 --> 47:05.970
I sure do!

47:05.970 --> 47:08.422
Everyone around here knows old Nala.

47:08.422 --> 47:10.700
What do you two city
slickers want with her?

47:10.700 --> 47:12.216
You serving a warrant?

47:12.216 --> 47:13.330
- A warrant?

47:13.330 --> 47:14.817
Goodness no!

47:14.817 --> 47:15.988
- A summons?

47:15.988 --> 47:17.160
(bell ringing)
- No.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.490
- Selling cookies?
- No, but if

47:19.490 --> 47:22.110
you have any we sure are hungry.

47:22.110 --> 47:24.340
- Yeah, we'll gladly take a dragon bag.

47:24.340 --> 47:27.400
- I'm vegan, I don't do cookies.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.350
- Gotcha, we're from Dragon Town,

47:29.350 --> 47:31.800
and the dragon Lacerta invaded us!

47:31.800 --> 47:34.420
He's holding our whole town hostage!

47:34.420 --> 47:36.860
- Who knows what will
become of our loved ones!

47:36.860 --> 47:39.800
- Our friend told us about
her Grandmother Nala.

47:39.800 --> 47:43.080
- And, the renowned fire
breathing powers she possesses!

47:43.080 --> 47:47.050
- Fire breathing power that
can defeat the dragon Lacerta.

47:47.050 --> 47:49.000
- So, we're on our way to find her,

47:49.000 --> 47:50.500
and ask her for her help.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.513
- Ha, you won't find old Nala,

47:52.513 --> 47:54.950
not unless she wants to be found.

47:54.950 --> 47:57.250
- So we've heard.
- We think she will

47:57.250 --> 47:58.440
want to be found!

47:58.440 --> 48:01.040
If her telepathy is as
strong as we're told,

48:01.040 --> 48:04.420
she'll realize her
granddaughter's in big trouble!

48:04.420 --> 48:06.010
- And she'll do anything in her power

48:06.010 --> 48:08.200
to help us drive Lacerta out!

48:08.200 --> 48:10.331
- Maybe, maybe not.

48:10.331 --> 48:13.410
Rumors of Nala's powers
are greatly exaggerated.

48:13.410 --> 48:15.630
I've probably talked to
her more than anyone alive,

48:15.630 --> 48:17.070
and she's old and tired,

48:17.070 --> 48:19.940
and ready to move on to the
next phase of existence.

48:19.940 --> 48:20.970
A mess like this would only

48:20.970 --> 48:21.990
bother her, and she
(bell ringing)

48:21.990 --> 48:23.210
doesn't need that!

48:23.210 --> 48:24.610
- Could we just see her?

48:24.610 --> 48:26.790
- I don't think it's a good idea.

48:26.790 --> 48:28.400
Why don't you go back and ask your friend

48:28.400 --> 48:29.850
to talk to her grandma?

48:29.850 --> 48:32.300
- She's baby dragon sitting!

48:32.300 --> 48:34.223
- Baby dragons, how cute!

48:34.223 --> 48:35.570
How old are they?

48:35.570 --> 48:36.941
- They're just hatchlings.

48:36.941 --> 48:38.720
- Hatchlings (squeals)!

48:38.720 --> 48:39.590
Cute overload.

48:39.590 --> 48:43.315
Go take care of those
sweeties, and let old Nala be.

48:43.315 --> 48:44.148
If your town is in

48:44.148 --> 48:44.981
(bell ringing)
great enough distress,

48:44.981 --> 48:47.819
she'll feel it, and
she'll do the right thing.

48:47.819 --> 48:52.819
(pleasant music)
(birds chirping)

48:59.250 --> 49:01.390
- Do you really think this
is the right move, Mika?

49:01.390 --> 49:03.070
What if we were close to finding Nala?

49:03.070 --> 49:04.940
And what if Mia was lying?

49:04.940 --> 49:07.460
- I think going back to get Luna is best.

49:07.460 --> 49:10.140
Lily can watch the hatchlings
while we reach Nala.

49:10.140 --> 49:11.730
And when she senses her granddaughter,

49:11.730 --> 49:14.270
she might even find us first.

49:14.270 --> 49:15.710
- I hope you're right.

49:15.710 --> 49:19.807
- Come on, let's hurry, there's
really no time to spare now!

49:19.807 --> 49:23.221
(pleasant music)

49:23.221 --> 49:26.054
(energetic music)

49:39.447 --> 49:44.447
(foreboding music)
(birds chirping)

49:47.220 --> 49:48.053
- You were right Draco.

49:48.053 --> 49:51.570
This lighthouse is a great
landmark for traveling.

49:51.570 --> 49:55.440
We can see it for miles
and miles in any direction.

49:55.440 --> 49:57.080
- Kind of like we could see those eggs

49:57.080 --> 49:59.700
for miles and miles in that field!

49:59.700 --> 50:01.530
There were millions of them!

50:01.530 --> 50:03.770
We could have searched for months!

50:03.770 --> 50:05.630
And without being able to touch down,

50:05.630 --> 50:07.950
it would have taken forever.

50:07.950 --> 50:10.912
- Oh Draco, what are we gonna do?

50:10.912 --> 50:13.320
Lacerta gonna be so mad when he hears

50:13.320 --> 50:15.567
that we can't find that
Ancient Dragon Egg,

50:15.567 --> 50:18.928
no matter how hard, or far we look!

50:18.928 --> 50:21.820
- (sighs) It's pointless to continue.

50:21.820 --> 50:26.160
Look, all I wanted was to learn
how to breath fire anyway.

50:26.160 --> 50:29.260
I never wanted to take over Dragon Town!

50:29.260 --> 50:32.550
Or go on some stupid ancient egg hunt!

50:32.550 --> 50:35.152
Or get back at anybody who wronged me!

50:35.152 --> 50:38.970
We're two months old for crying out loud!

50:38.970 --> 50:41.560
Revenge won't be a thing until we're like,

50:41.560 --> 50:43.550
at least, six months!

50:43.550 --> 50:46.950
- I know, breathing fire
is all I want to do too!

50:46.950 --> 50:49.652
Just learning how to rear
back and let 'em rip.

50:49.652 --> 50:50.813
(burping)
Ho!

50:51.803 --> 50:53.591
- Grus, you did it!

50:53.591 --> 50:56.303
You did it, you spit fire!

50:56.303 --> 50:57.572
How?

50:57.572 --> 50:59.601
- I, I don't know.

50:59.601 --> 51:02.487
I, I just, it just happened (chuckles).

51:04.530 --> 51:07.190
- That was incredible!

51:07.190 --> 51:09.150
Do it again, do it again!

51:09.150 --> 51:10.481
- Okay!

51:10.481 --> 51:13.367
(snarling)

51:13.367 --> 51:14.670
(bell ringing)
I can't.

51:14.670 --> 51:16.345
- What do you mean you can't?

51:16.345 --> 51:18.290
You just did it!

51:18.290 --> 51:19.920
- But I don't know what I did!

51:19.920 --> 51:22.170
It just came out like, whoosh.

51:22.170 --> 51:23.730
- I'll say.

51:23.730 --> 51:26.620
What was it like, did you feel it coming?

51:26.620 --> 51:30.890
- I, I don't remember, I
was as surprised as you!

51:30.890 --> 51:32.220
- Hey I know, let's go back

51:32.220 --> 51:34.750
to Lacerta's castle and show him!

51:34.750 --> 51:36.240
- Show Lacerta?

51:36.240 --> 51:37.073
The most fearsome
(bell ringing)

51:37.073 --> 51:39.433
fire breather, in all the world?

51:39.433 --> 51:41.592
What if I can't do it again?

51:41.592 --> 51:44.090
- Aw, have some faith buddy!

51:44.090 --> 51:46.892
Maybe you just need to
get worked up to do it!

51:46.892 --> 51:49.510
Lacerta'll make you good and nervous!

51:49.510 --> 51:51.020
Pay attention next time.

51:51.020 --> 51:54.569
- Ah, oh, okay.

51:54.569 --> 51:58.157
- Come on, we'll tell him we
couldn't find the stupid egg.

51:58.157 --> 52:00.370
But we can breath fire!

52:00.370 --> 52:03.080
He'll see that the two
of us are all he needs,

52:03.080 --> 52:06.290
and probably forget all
about that dumb egg!

52:06.290 --> 52:09.460
- Draco, that's a terrible idea.

52:09.460 --> 52:12.740
- Nah, trust me, he'll like our chutzpa!

52:12.740 --> 52:17.290
- Our what?
- Nevermind Grus, nevermind.

52:17.290 --> 52:19.200
(pleasant music)
- Well Mika,

52:19.200 --> 52:21.200
Dragon Town is still standing.

52:21.200 --> 52:23.020
- [Mika] I guess that's good news.

52:23.020 --> 52:24.606
Hey there's Luna!

52:24.606 --> 52:28.000
- Mika, Mylo, what are you two doing back?

52:28.000 --> 52:30.090
Did you find Grandmother Nala?

52:30.090 --> 52:32.680
- No, but we found someone who knows here.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.550
She suggested that Nala would be

52:34.550 --> 52:37.320
more receptive to you than to us.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.140
- So we came back to get you, come on!

52:39.140 --> 52:43.090
- But the hatchlings, I'm
still dragon baby sitting!

52:43.090 --> 52:46.420
- It's no problem, our
friend Lily is taking over.

52:46.420 --> 52:48.400
She's a sweetheart.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.250
- She's really good with hatchlings!

52:50.250 --> 52:51.820
- She'll probably have them reading

52:51.820 --> 52:53.590
by the time we get back!

52:53.590 --> 52:56.152
- Oh, um, okay.

52:56.152 --> 52:57.673
(wind howling)
(bird keening)

52:57.673 --> 53:00.303
- Acolytes, have you brought me

53:00.303 --> 53:02.240
the Ancient Dragon Egg,

53:02.240 --> 53:07.240
that will grant me everlasting
command of all dragon forces,

53:08.900 --> 53:13.722
on land, in the skies, or in the sea?

53:13.722 --> 53:14.660
- The sea?

53:14.660 --> 53:16.370
Can dragons swim?

53:16.370 --> 53:17.271
- Sure.

53:17.271 --> 53:19.400
You've never swam before?

53:19.400 --> 53:21.680
- No, I'm scared of the water.

53:21.680 --> 53:23.550
- Scared of the water?

53:23.550 --> 53:25.940
What kind of crazy talk is that?

53:25.940 --> 53:27.930
- It's not crazy talk!

53:27.930 --> 53:29.520
I don't like the water.

53:29.520 --> 53:32.560
- Eh, how do you take baths?

53:32.560 --> 53:34.100
- You take baths?
(bird keening)

53:34.100 --> 53:36.020
- I don't believe this.

53:36.020 --> 53:38.550
You know I thought you smelled funny.

53:38.550 --> 53:40.441
- I smell, I do not!

53:40.441 --> 53:41.899
- [Draco] Do to!

53:41.899 --> 53:43.148
- [Grus] Do not!

53:43.148 --> 53:44.510
- Do to!

53:44.510 --> 53:45.921
(snarling)

53:45.921 --> 53:47.020
- Enough!

53:47.020 --> 53:48.750
The Ancient Egg!

53:48.750 --> 53:50.867
Where is, the Ancient Egg?

53:52.290 --> 53:53.390
- Oh that, (chuckles).

53:54.260 --> 53:57.350
We uh, we couldn't find it.

53:57.350 --> 53:58.363
- You, what?

53:59.740 --> 54:02.740
- We looked everywhere
Lacerta, we promise!

54:02.740 --> 54:05.460
High and low, near and far.

54:05.460 --> 54:07.950
- If there was a stone, we overturned it,

54:07.950 --> 54:10.200
if there was a tree, we climbed it.

54:10.200 --> 54:13.803
- Yet still you disobey me!

54:15.001 --> 54:17.630
- Disobey, no, not us!

54:17.630 --> 54:19.290
- Yeah we're your boys!

54:19.290 --> 54:21.890
We're good Pixy Dragons!

54:21.890 --> 54:22.723
- Good?

54:22.723 --> 54:26.030
Lacerta hates all that is good!

54:26.030 --> 54:29.600
- I meant bad, we're a
couple of bad Pixies!

54:29.600 --> 54:31.750
- Nasty, the worst!

54:31.750 --> 54:34.990
- [Draco] Everyone in
Dragon Town hates our guts!

54:34.990 --> 54:37.310
- Hey, we should stomp 'em out!

54:37.310 --> 54:39.100
- Yeah, all of 'em!

54:39.100 --> 54:40.349
- Right on!

54:40.349 --> 54:43.739
- (snarls) Shut up, both of you!

54:43.739 --> 54:45.337
- Okay.
- Okay.

54:45.337 --> 54:48.010
- When you journeyed to this castle

54:48.010 --> 54:51.042
to beg help breathing fire,

54:51.042 --> 54:53.875
you unwittingly unleashed Lacerta!

54:54.840 --> 54:56.623
- Don't we know it.

54:56.623 --> 55:00.260
- And with Lacerta comes
the power, and fury,

55:00.260 --> 55:03.163
of the world's most feared dragon!

55:04.030 --> 55:05.642
- We know that too.

55:05.642 --> 55:10.242
- A command from Lacerta is
to be heeded without question,

55:10.242 --> 55:11.723
and without delay!

55:12.640 --> 55:14.735
- I wasn't clear on that one.

55:14.735 --> 55:19.242
- Yeah, we didn't discuss
like a timeframe or anything.

55:19.242 --> 55:20.783
- No, no time limits.

55:21.621 --> 55:24.121
(tense music)

55:27.111 --> 55:28.818
- Grandmother Nala!
(birds chirping)

55:28.818 --> 55:32.739
- L-L-Luna, is that you my dear?

55:32.739 --> 55:35.400
- [Luna] Yes, yes it's me Grandmother!

55:35.400 --> 55:39.941
- Oh Luna, my sweet, sweet Pixy!

55:39.941 --> 55:41.393
You're growing so fast!

55:42.420 --> 55:44.970
It's been so long!

55:44.970 --> 55:48.430
- [Luna] I'm sorry Grandmother,
time moves so fast.

55:48.430 --> 55:50.290
- That it does.

55:50.290 --> 55:53.080
When you look back from my perspective,

55:53.080 --> 55:55.870
it's like the bat of a wing.

55:55.870 --> 55:59.630
Who is this Pixy pair you've
brought along with you?

55:59.630 --> 56:01.600
- [Luna] These are my
good friends Grandmother,

56:01.600 --> 56:02.740
Mika and Mylo.

56:02.740 --> 56:05.200
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.429
- Well hello you two.

56:07.429 --> 56:09.420
Welcome to my home.

56:09.420 --> 56:11.610
- Thank you for having us Nala.

56:11.610 --> 56:14.150
- Yeah, we've been looking
everywhere for you.

56:14.150 --> 56:15.810
- Oh?
- Grandmother,

56:15.810 --> 56:18.040
I'm so sorry to come to you like this,

56:18.040 --> 56:21.400
but, I'm afraid we're in trouble!

56:21.400 --> 56:24.860
- Oh no, what sort of trouble my dear?

56:24.860 --> 56:27.319
- Lacerta the dragon trouble!

56:27.319 --> 56:28.486
- Uh, Lacerta?

56:29.720 --> 56:34.720
But, I thought, the townsdragons
banished him long ago!

56:35.080 --> 56:38.470
- He's back!
- And meaner than ever!

56:38.470 --> 56:40.880
- [Luna] Two of our town
Pixies foolishly went

56:40.880 --> 56:43.010
and found his lair, Nala.

56:43.010 --> 56:47.370
- Oh no, why would they do such a thing?

56:47.370 --> 56:48.880
- For glory!

56:48.880 --> 56:50.760
- They thought he'd help
them to breath fire,

56:50.760 --> 56:52.480
which they'd then use to win the

56:52.480 --> 56:54.910
Fire Breathing Contest
our town is holding.

56:54.910 --> 56:56.940
Or, was holding.

56:56.940 --> 57:00.633
- Why, that is the most
foolish plan I ever did hear!

57:01.649 --> 57:04.770
I've known Lacerta for 300 years,

57:04.770 --> 57:07.290
and in all that time, he's never helped

57:07.290 --> 57:11.180
a single living creature, except himself!

57:11.180 --> 57:13.010
- When he reappeared in Dragon Town,

57:13.010 --> 57:15.680
Lacerta was very angry Nala!

57:15.680 --> 57:18.360
He crashed out talent
elimination show in the square,

57:18.360 --> 57:20.180
and threatened us all!

57:20.180 --> 57:22.120
- He told us, we all belong to him now.

57:22.120 --> 57:26.060
- Hmm, same old Lacerta all right.

57:26.060 --> 57:27.990
- None of the Pixy dragons in town

57:27.990 --> 57:29.520
know what to do Grandmother,

57:29.520 --> 57:31.220
or which way to turn!

57:31.220 --> 57:34.320
They've never faced anyone
like Lacerta before!

57:34.320 --> 57:37.550
- We've never faced
anything bad at all, really.

57:37.550 --> 57:40.520
- Right, life's been
pretty good in Dragon Town.

57:40.520 --> 57:43.670
- That's because, once upon a time,

57:43.670 --> 57:48.380
the town elders, myself
included, made a choice.

57:48.380 --> 57:50.520
We would use all the good magic

57:50.520 --> 57:54.090
at our dragon disposal,
to drive the bad elements,

57:54.090 --> 57:57.660
like Lacerta, out of Dragon Town forever.

57:57.660 --> 58:01.290
And in doing so, we
would usher in an age of

58:01.290 --> 58:05.130
peace and tranquility,
for generations to come,

58:05.130 --> 58:09.470
allowing all pixy families to
raise their young, happily.

58:09.470 --> 58:12.530
No pixy was ever supposed to know war,

58:12.530 --> 58:16.350
or famine, or strife
of any kind ever again!

58:16.350 --> 58:21.350
Until you three delivered
this dreadful, dreadful news!

58:21.620 --> 58:24.300
- I'm so sorry Grandmother Nala!

58:24.300 --> 58:27.150
I'd give anything to avoid
bringing you this news,

58:27.150 --> 58:29.020
but I simply couldn't!

58:29.020 --> 58:31.920
- It's all right my dear, it's all right.

58:31.920 --> 58:35.410
Now that Lacerta is back,
and you know what it is

58:35.410 --> 58:38.780
he plans to do, our path is clear.

58:38.780 --> 58:41.720
We have only one choice.

58:41.720 --> 58:43.260
- What's that Nala?

58:43.260 --> 58:45.350
- I'm going to teach you Pixy dragons

58:45.350 --> 58:48.290
all I know about fire breathing,

58:48.290 --> 58:52.240
then you're gonna go find
that big mean dragon,

58:52.240 --> 58:55.363
and do what we did way back in the day.

58:56.440 --> 58:59.906
You're gonna kick his ugly butt!

58:59.906 --> 59:02.296
- Yay!
(vigorous music)

59:02.296 --> 59:03.129
- Yay!

59:04.392 --> 59:09.392
(wind howling)
(bird keening)

59:11.490 --> 59:13.180
- Well lookie here!

59:13.180 --> 59:14.920
What's gotten into you Luna?

59:14.920 --> 59:18.460
You want to drop those Dragon Town zeroes,

59:18.460 --> 59:21.914
and come up here to join
the fire breathing heroes?

59:21.914 --> 59:24.340
- (chuckles) Nice one Draco.

59:24.340 --> 59:25.670
- Not at all Grus.

59:25.670 --> 59:28.050
I'm here to ask you two
to drop what you're doing,

59:28.050 --> 59:30.130
and leave this castle at once!

59:30.130 --> 59:31.954
Dragon Town needs you!

59:31.954 --> 59:34.020
Lacerta can't win, and he's about

59:34.020 --> 59:36.045
to find that out the hard way!

59:36.045 --> 59:40.020
- (chuckles) I'll believe
it when I see it, Pixy face.

59:40.020 --> 59:40.853
- Yeah.

59:40.853 --> 59:43.360
It's gonna take more than
a bunch of minidragons

59:43.360 --> 59:45.714
to drive this dragon out again.

59:45.714 --> 59:47.760
Lacerta's here to stay.

59:47.760 --> 59:50.373
The sooner you realize it,
the better off you'll be.

59:51.330 --> 59:52.460
- That's right.

59:52.460 --> 59:54.637
Hey, I did it again!

59:54.637 --> 59:57.490
- You did, way to go Grus!

59:57.490 --> 59:59.413
Tell me how, I want to do it too!

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.700
Remember, we both gotta
win that contest pal!

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.550
Tie champions, me and you!

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:08.240
- Tie champions!

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.170
- Does this mean you two
are staying with Lacerta?

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:12.340
- That's right Luna!

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.750
And you're on the loser's team!

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:18.277
- Scram Pixy girl, winners
only up here (chuckles)!

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:20.763
- Have it your way.

01:00:21.658 --> 01:00:26.475
(wind howling)
(resolute music)

01:00:26.475 --> 01:00:30.570
- (chuckles) Can you believe
the audacity of that Pixy?

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:32.560
- She's always been stuck up.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.680
Let her go hide under
a bed in Dragon Town.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.870
- Yeah, try to keep her
tail tucked (chuckles)!

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:41.600
Hey, hey come on, teach
me that fire trick, Grus.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.750
- I never remember.

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:44.960
I still don't know how I'm doing it.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.300
- Oh come on, I'm your best pal!

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.210
If I have a (mumbles), I'd give you half.

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:54.520
We share everything, remember?

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.516
- I'd tell you if I knew
Draco, I swear I would!

01:00:57.516 --> 01:01:01.920
- (grunts) Don't hold out
on me, that's not Pixy nice!

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.910
- Draco, I'm not holding out!

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.350
- We'll see about that!

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:08.090
I'm gonna learn your trick,
and do it better than you!

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:10.190
Then I'm gonna win that
fire breathing contest,

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:12.380
and you're gonna be
nothing but a runner up!

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.640
Then they'll call you
Grub, 'cause you're grubby!

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.570
Nothing but a grubby bum!

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:21.440
- Aw Draco, I thought we
were buddies for life?

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.880
- Well, you thought wrong, loser!

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.380
I'm going straight to the top, no stops!

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.380
Aha, I told you!

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.415
- You did it Draco!

01:01:31.415 --> 01:01:32.900
(bird crying)
You did it!

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.590
- Zip it Grubby!

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.567
- Okay.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:40.567
(resolute music)
(wind howling)

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:50.253
- Welcome back Lacerta,
it's been a long time.

01:01:51.148 --> 01:01:53.868
(snarling)

01:01:53.868 --> 01:01:56.035
(hissing)

01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:59.080
- They're getting away, Luna!

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.370
- No they're not,

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:03.081
remember what Grandmother
taught us, come on!

01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:06.581
(grunting)
- Ooh, action!

01:02:10.145 --> 01:02:13.078
(flames roaring)

01:02:13.078 --> 01:02:15.661
(wind howling)

01:02:17.796 --> 01:02:20.546
(flames roaring)

01:02:23.697 --> 01:02:25.286
(wind howling)

01:02:25.286 --> 01:02:27.920
- [Lacerta] Is that all
you've got, come on!

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.383
Give it your best shot,
you (mumbles) lighters!

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:35.727
(snarling)
(hissing)

01:02:35.727 --> 01:02:37.380
- Careful what you wish for,

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.280
jerk face, you just might get it!

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.712
- [Draco] You talk tough
with your friends around you.

01:02:43.712 --> 01:02:45.420
But I remember you begging us not

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:48.407
to bully you in dragon gym class!

01:02:48.407 --> 01:02:50.337
(grunting)
- Yay (chuckles).

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:53.780
Please you guys, please
don't pull my tail!

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.960
He cried!

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.480
- [Mika] And I remember you trying so hard

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.190
to breath fire that you passed
out in first period Grus.

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.560
- [Grus] Did not!

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.786
- [Mylo] Did too, we all saw it!

01:03:04.786 --> 01:03:06.990
- [Draco] They got you there pal,

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:09.830
I filmed the paramedics carrying you out!

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:11.370
- [Grus] You what?

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:13.020
Some friends you are!

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:13.853
- [Draco] What?

01:03:13.853 --> 01:03:15.357
It was funny!

01:03:15.357 --> 01:03:18.190
(Lacerta laughing)

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:20.140
- [Lacerta] It sounds funny (chuckles)!

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.790
- [Draco] I know, right?

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:24.250
- [Mika] Time's up Lacerta,

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:27.332
your reign of fire is coming to an end!

01:03:27.332 --> 01:03:31.091
(Lacerta hissing)
(wind howling)

01:03:31.091 --> 01:03:33.406
- [Lacerta] But I just got started!

01:03:33.406 --> 01:03:35.370
I (mumbles),

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:38.287
I sent you Pixy dragons scurrying

01:03:38.287 --> 01:03:40.400
to Hades before you were born!

01:03:44.815 --> 01:03:47.120
What I'm capable of!

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.700
- [Mika] I've seen enough, we all have!

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.236
With the power invested in
me by my Grandmother Nala!

01:03:53.236 --> 01:03:56.278
- [Lacerta] (gasps) Nala!

01:03:56.278 --> 01:03:58.730
Nala is your grandmother?

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:00.580
- That's right, she is!
(wind howling)

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.620
- [Mylo] We got friends
in high place Lacerta,

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.587
higher places than this!

01:04:04.587 --> 01:04:09.050
- [Lacerta] It only means,
you have farther to fall, rat!

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:10.700
Take this!

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.290
(snarling)

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.070
- Whoo, close call!

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:17.913
- [Mika] Nice shot, now you take this!

01:04:17.913 --> 01:04:19.193
(flames roaring)

01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:21.974
(inspiring music)

01:04:21.974 --> 01:04:26.301
(bird keening)
(Lacerta groaning)

01:04:26.301 --> 01:04:29.934
- [Lacerta] That flame was too bright!

01:04:29.934 --> 01:04:31.382
(Draco screaming)

01:04:31.382 --> 01:04:34.180
- [Draco] Whoa, that was hot!

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.840
(Grus screaming)

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.220
- [Grus] Ouch, it sure was!

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.484
- [Lacerta] I give up!

01:04:40.484 --> 01:04:44.433
You're just like your grandmother, Luna!

01:04:44.433 --> 01:04:47.313
I can't beat a dragon like this!

01:04:47.313 --> 01:04:50.233
I'm going back to my castle, see ya!

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:53.850
- [Draco] Wait, you're
not giving up are you?

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:55.985
- [Lacerta] Let's just say,

01:04:55.985 --> 01:04:59.068
I'm retiring from ruling Dragon Town.

01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:03.553
I'm too old to battle new dragon blood!

01:05:05.326 --> 01:05:07.640
- [Grus] What, what about us?

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.270
- [Mika] You two are in trouble!

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:11.390
(pleasant music)

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:15.158
(cheering)
(applauding)

01:05:15.158 --> 01:05:17.450
(grunting)

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:20.480
- Attention, every dragon, attention!

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.300
Welcome to the First Annual Dragon Town

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.513
Fire Breathing Contest!

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:32.180
As you are all aware, I am Mayor Argon,

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.880
and I'll be your host for this afternoon.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.943
And have we got a show for you!

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:38.723
But first, first,

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.990
I'd like to point out
some heroes in our town,

01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:46.710
without whom, we wouldn't
even be here today!

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:50.380
You all know, it's still
fresh in all of our minds,

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.310
that monster Lacerta,
and what he attempted

01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:55.690
to do to our peaceful town,

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.880
with the aid of some of our
own Pixy dragons no less.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.330
We'd all like to forget, but,

01:06:01.926 --> 01:06:04.260
you should always, always remember,

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.963
so that it never, ever happens again.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:13.330
Please, now, allow me to
introduce our littlest heroes,

01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:15.350
with the biggest hearts!

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:20.350
Ladies and gentledragons, I
give you Mika, Mylo, and Luna!

01:06:21.656 --> 01:06:25.130
(cheering)
(applauding)

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:28.275
They saved Dragon Town, they saved us all!

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:29.670
Let 'em hear it!

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:31.873
Pixy power, yeah!

01:06:35.281 --> 01:06:38.385
Okay, okay, quiet down, quiet down!

01:06:38.385 --> 01:06:41.530
There'll be plenty of time
for celebration later,

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.030
plenty of time!

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:46.820
Right now we have a champion
fire breather to crown!

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.435
What do you say we get to it!

01:06:48.435 --> 01:06:52.180
(cheering)
(applauding)

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.380
Oh what the flame, I'll
take a shot at it too!

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.943
This is for you, dragons!

01:06:58.137 --> 01:07:00.065
(roaring)

01:07:00.065 --> 01:07:04.732
(cheering)
(applauding)

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.940
(grunting)

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.950
- Hi everybody, it's me!

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:17.620
I'm pretty tired from all
the excitement earlier but,

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.980
I couldn't pass this up.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:22.380
All my life, I've hoped,
and waited, and tried,

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.390
with all my might to breath fire!

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:27.140
And all my life I could
never figure it out,

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.920
until today!

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.970
I was lucky enough, to
breath with some of the best!

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:35.810
My dear friend Luna, and
her wonderful grandma Nala,

01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:37.177
big shout out to Nala!

01:07:37.177 --> 01:07:39.532
(cheering)
- Nala!

01:07:39.532 --> 01:07:40.365
Nala!

01:07:41.346 --> 01:07:42.908
Nala!

01:07:42.908 --> 01:07:44.491
- Nala, Nala, Nala!

01:07:45.567 --> 01:07:49.760
And, my best friend in the
whole dragon universe, Mika!

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.820
I love you Mika, long may we fly!

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:55.370
Okay, I know I'm putting
all your wings to sleep.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:56.360
I'll get to it.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.220
Here goes my best shot!

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.077
One, two, three!

01:08:02.127 --> 01:08:04.122
(Mylo roaring)
(flames roaring)

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:07.437
(cheering)
(applauding)

01:08:07.437 --> 01:08:09.160
Thank you Dragon Town!

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:09.993
Hoo hoo!

01:08:11.967 --> 01:08:13.727
- [All] Mylo!

01:08:13.727 --> 01:08:15.398
Mylo!

01:08:15.398 --> 01:08:17.196
Mylo!

01:08:17.196 --> 01:08:18.473
Mylo!

01:08:23.912 --> 01:08:25.832
(grunting)

01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:28.654
- Hello Dragon Town!

01:08:28.654 --> 01:08:30.423
- [All] Mika!

01:08:30.423 --> 01:08:31.256
Mika!

01:08:32.283 --> 01:08:33.800
Mika!

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.100
- It's so good to be here, I mean that!

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.830
It's been a heck of a
couple days, hasn't it?

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:41.939
Real quick, I just want to say,

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:44.983
without being as long winded
as my friend Mylo there.

01:08:44.983 --> 01:08:48.090
(cheering)
(applauding)

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.040
Kidding, kidding.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.490
Love you too, buddy.

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:54.529
I just want to say, from
the bottom of my Pixy heart,

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:57.200
that I love Dragon Town!

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.149
Now and forever!

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:00.609
(crow cawing)

01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:03.264
Long live Dragon Town!

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:04.096
(cheering)
(applauding)

01:09:04.096 --> 01:09:05.772
- [All] Dragon Town!

01:09:05.772 --> 01:09:07.553
Dragon Town!

01:09:07.553 --> 01:09:09.377
Dragon Town!

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:12.294
- Dragon Town, Dragon Town, dragon!

01:09:13.971 --> 01:09:16.258
(Mika roaring)
(flames roaring)

01:09:16.258 --> 01:09:21.008
(cheering)
(applauding)

01:09:22.865 --> 01:09:23.698
(pleasant music)

01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:26.040
- I can't believe Lacerta still wants us

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.830
to find that stupid Ancient Dragon Egg!

01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:30.750
What a waste of time.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:33.890
- I know, we've been kicking
rocks our here for hours.

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:35.250
My toes hurt.

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.569
- You sure they're not burned

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:39.100
from those Pixies spitting fire at us?

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.502
- Nah, I'm a little
singed, but not burned.

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:44.160
- They won't get away with this,

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.200
we'll be back, mark my words!

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.609
Then Dragon Town's gonna pay!

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:52.170
- I hope so, they have all my toys,

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:54.130
my books, my bed.

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:57.070
There's nothing I love more
than a good night's sleep,

01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:58.440
let me tell you!

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.570
- Now we have no choice but to stay up

01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:03.030
in that big castle with Lacerta.

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:05.630
- And he bosses us around all day long,

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:08.230
with all his dumb revenge plots.

01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:10.130
There's not a moment's rest.

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:14.217
- Well, there will be Grus, there will be.

01:10:14.217 --> 01:10:16.180
Lacerta's one thing,
(crow cawing)

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.240
but Dragon Town will rue the day

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.140
they cast out Draco and Grus!

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:25.146
We'll be back, and they'll be sorry!

01:10:25.146 --> 01:10:30.146
(pleasant music)
(crow cawing)
