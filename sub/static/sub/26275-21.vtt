00:15.885 --> 00:18.105
Hey, Kyle.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.584
Damn it.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.239
Kyle. Kyle!

00:22.283 --> 00:24.850
Here I am!

00:24.894 --> 00:26.461
[laughing]

00:26.504 --> 00:29.290
You had no idea where I was.

00:30.987 --> 00:34.077
No. Had I known, I would've
taped that box up.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.516
You haven't packed
any of this stuff up.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.084
Well, I started to,
but I took a long stroll

00:41.128 --> 00:43.086
down memory lane...

00:43.130 --> 00:46.263
when I found this.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.699
A hanger.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.571
Well, thehanger.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.268
From when I first moved in.
Remember?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.966
-No.
-Well, I used to leave my coat

00:54.010 --> 00:55.490
laying on the sofa all the time.Remember?

00:55.533 --> 00:57.144
No.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.667
And you said, "Hang up your coat

00:58.710 --> 01:00.016
or I'm gonna smack you
in the head." Remember?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.366
Yes.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.368
Yeah, and I said, "Where am I
supposed to hang it up?"

01:04.412 --> 01:05.978
And you said, "In the closet."
And I said, "With what?"

01:06.022 --> 01:07.241
And you said, "A hanger."
And I said,

01:07.284 --> 01:09.460
"What hanger?"
And you said, "This hanger."

01:09.504 --> 01:11.810
Thishanger.

01:11.854 --> 01:14.030
First off,
the hanger stays here.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.686
Message received,
you old softie.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.514
You got to pack
all this stuff up.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.125
This is why we had to cancel
the moving truck last week.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.909
I know.
I know, it's just...

01:23.953 --> 01:26.173
everything I pick up tells me
a beautiful story

01:26.216 --> 01:27.609
about my time here.

01:27.652 --> 01:31.221
I understand.
How about this?

01:31.265 --> 01:33.963
You pack it up real quick,it'll tell you the same stories,

01:34.006 --> 01:37.358
even better ones as you'reunpacking it at your new house.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.621
-All right. I'll get on it.
I promise.
-Okay.

01:39.664 --> 01:42.276
Oh, um, would you ask Mandy
to give me a hand?

01:42.319 --> 01:44.974
Geez. Mandy. Mandy!

01:45.017 --> 01:47.019
Here I am!

01:52.242 --> 01:54.244
♪

01:59.075 --> 02:01.773
You know, Air Force Academy
food is good,

02:01.817 --> 02:03.210
but there's something about
a meal at home

02:03.253 --> 02:05.212
-that just tastes
so much better.
-Yep.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.736
Well, you're old enough
I can tell you the secret:

02:07.779 --> 02:09.433
I use obscene amounts of butter.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.437
-Oh, I love special occasions.
Morning.
-Morning.

02:13.481 --> 02:17.441
Hey. Because there's waffles
and I don't have to cook them.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.660
-That's right.
-[chuckles]

02:18.703 --> 02:20.357
You can cook them anytime
you want,

02:20.401 --> 02:21.663
just not on the waffle maker

02:21.706 --> 02:23.839
that my dad passed on to me.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.449
You know, Mike, my grandmother
passed me down

02:25.493 --> 02:28.583
a loom.
Doesn't mean I have to use it.

02:28.626 --> 02:31.412
That's because a loom is stupid.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.109
[scoffs]

02:33.153 --> 02:36.460
This thing's got generations
of Baxter family flavor

02:36.504 --> 02:37.853
baked right into it.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.421
Ew. You said it was butter.

02:40.464 --> 02:43.424
Make all the jokes you want,
but this is a big day for me.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.252
This is when my nearly
30-year-old daughter

02:45.295 --> 02:49.299
-and her husband
move out of the house.
-Mm. [chuckles]

02:49.343 --> 02:51.867
Well, in that case,
I am opening champagne.

02:51.910 --> 02:54.130
Uh, I'm adding orange juice.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.045
I'm not a lush.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.264
As long as we're celebrating,

02:57.307 --> 02:58.569
I'm gonna add some more
chocolate chips,

02:58.613 --> 03:02.051
making this waffle
one step closer to cake.

03:03.095 --> 03:04.445
Honey, aren't you upset?

03:04.488 --> 03:05.620
You're finally home
for the summer

03:05.663 --> 03:07.491
and your sister's leaving?

03:07.535 --> 03:09.232
She's like the sun.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.668
I enjoy her from a distance,

03:10.712 --> 03:14.237
but if you spend too much with
her, you'll suffer a stroke.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.022
Ooh, champagne and orange juice.

03:17.066 --> 03:20.896
That's called an Omarosa.

03:20.939 --> 03:24.247
Actually, that would be
champagne and sour grapes.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.249
-Ooh.
-[chuckles]

03:26.293 --> 03:29.252
Ah, waffles. One of the most
memorable smells.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.080
-MIKE: Mm-hmm.
-You know, it's like
fresh cut grass

03:31.123 --> 03:33.865
or gasoline covering the trailerright before your mom

03:33.909 --> 03:36.346
files an insurance claim.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.305
You know, the key to making
a great waffle

03:38.348 --> 03:41.525
is hard on the outside,
soft on the inside.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.049
It's almost the opposite
of how it is in your artery.

03:44.093 --> 03:46.182
-It's just...
-All right.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.184
Sit down, guys. Why don't I getsome breakfast in you

03:48.228 --> 03:49.533
-before the
moving truck arrives?
-Yep.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.666
Oh, actually, we canceled that.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.624
This will be the third time
you've canceled this thing.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.278
-What's going on?
-No, now, hey, hey, hey.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.279
Maybe they have a good reason.

03:56.323 --> 03:59.151
Which I would really
love to hear.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.110
Yeah. We-we ordered
some curtains,

04:01.153 --> 04:02.459
and we thought we'd wait
till they got delivered.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.418
We don't want people peeking in.

04:04.461 --> 04:07.682
Trust me. Nobody
wants to watch you and Kyle

04:07.725 --> 04:10.250
try to program a stove clock.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.342
Heh.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.303
Hey, Ed?

04:20.347 --> 04:21.739
I got your text.
What's the emergency?

04:21.783 --> 04:23.350
No, no, no.
Did you see a customer

04:23.393 --> 04:26.222
who drove off
in a cherry red convertible?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.397
Oh. I don't know.
Did he hit something?

04:27.441 --> 04:28.442
No, no, no, no, no.

04:28.485 --> 04:29.573
How do you think I would look

04:29.617 --> 04:31.575
in a cherry red convertible?

04:31.619 --> 04:33.882
Okay, we-we need to talk

04:33.925 --> 04:36.319
about the word "emergency".

04:36.363 --> 04:39.540
-[indistinct chatter]-Yoo-hoo. Anybody want a muffin?

04:39.583 --> 04:42.934
-Ooh. Absolutely.
-Someone was up
all night baking.

04:42.978 --> 04:46.024
And then I bought some
from the bakery.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.939
-Mmm. Mmm.
-What's that?

04:47.983 --> 04:50.768
-The whole thing tastes
just like the top.
-Mmm.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.815
And that granola bar in my deskcan go kiss my ass.

04:53.858 --> 04:57.384
[laughs]I'm so glad you guys like them.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.821
Uh, hey. Are you guys
gonna be here tomorrow?

04:59.864 --> 05:01.605
-Mm-hmm. All day.
-Great.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.781
Uh, Boyd's school
is doing their spring musical,

05:03.825 --> 05:05.783
so he's gonna come in with me
and do some fund-raising.

05:05.827 --> 05:09.570
Seems like he was just here
for Peter Pan.
-[chuckles]

05:09.613 --> 05:11.702
Yep. Uh, this year
they're doing Music Man.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.487
He's so excited to tell
you guys about it.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.924
Have a great day.
Thanks, bye.

05:15.967 --> 05:19.014
[chuckles] I knew
this muffin would cost me.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.624
[grunts]

05:20.668 --> 05:23.714
Last year he talked me into
that "Tiger Lily" package.

05:23.758 --> 05:27.718
-Mmm.
-200 bucks for
a signed cast photo

05:27.762 --> 05:31.200
and a room temperature soda
at intermission.

05:31.243 --> 05:34.725
This year...
I'm not gonna do it.

05:34.769 --> 05:35.944
What?

05:35.987 --> 05:39.164
Yeah. He asks me to donate?

05:39.208 --> 05:40.992
I'm gonna say no.

05:41.036 --> 05:43.778
Wow. But...
but that's Mike's grandson.

05:43.821 --> 05:47.738
-Yeah.
-He-he doesn't realize
that the kid's a jackass.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.871
I don't give a damn.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.742
I'm done.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.005
All right.
Me too.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.572
I'm not gonna bankroll
that kid anymore.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.487
-Yeah.
-All right? Yeah, right.
[chuckles]

05:57.531 --> 06:00.098
And I'm talking all these
bribe muffins.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.538
We got to get rid
of these sponges.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.757
Really?
I just bought those.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.803
No.
I mean Kyle and Mandy.

06:10.674 --> 06:13.416
Yeah. Well, uh, you know,
they'll be gone soon enough.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.549
It's-it's like Mandy
in high school:

06:15.592 --> 06:19.335
-dicey for a while,
but she got out.
-Right...

06:19.379 --> 06:20.597
She even said it herself.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.599
She's not feeling any pressure
to move out.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.471
I want to put some
pressure on her.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.429
Okay. What-what do you
want me to say?

06:26.473 --> 06:28.475
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.477
I-I realize we attract more
flies with honey than vinegar,

06:30.520 --> 06:33.436
but we want to get rid
of the flies.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.395
-I can be tough.
-Honey.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.355
[chuckles]

06:42.053 --> 06:44.447
I don't like
watching old movies.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.667
Everybody who was in them
is dead.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.496
-Like, see that adorable kid?
-Mm-hmm.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.236
Dead.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.282
Hey, uh, could you guys

06:53.325 --> 06:56.067
turn that off for just a second?

06:56.111 --> 06:58.069
All right, listen up.
I've been thinking about this,

06:58.113 --> 07:01.464
and if you guys don't want
to move into the apartment,

07:01.508 --> 07:03.510
I'm gonna have to find
another tenant.

07:03.553 --> 07:04.946
Wait, what are you
talking about?

07:04.989 --> 07:07.905
You know what
he's talking about.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.568
We spent a lot of money
fixing that place up,

07:18.612 --> 07:20.701
and I think we've done
a great job.

07:20.744 --> 07:21.963
And if you guys
aren't gonna move in,

07:22.006 --> 07:23.747
I'm gonna
put it back on the market,

07:23.791 --> 07:26.141
so I'm saying you're gonna haveto move in tomorrow.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.535
Well, Dad you're-you're puttingus under a lot of pressure.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.146
-I know.
-We know!

07:36.760 --> 07:39.546
Well, I... I mean, I guess,
when you put it that way,

07:39.589 --> 07:40.895
we don't really have a choice.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.766
Exactly.

07:42.810 --> 07:43.724
Rent it to someone else.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.861
-What?
-No... You...

07:50.905 --> 07:52.776
You realize you're gonna
lose the apartment.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.475
-I know.
-We know!

08:00.175 --> 08:01.872
Hey, let's go unpack, babe.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.353
I still get to use the hanger.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.880
Wow.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.014
I know this is probably
too late, but, um...

08:13.057 --> 08:14.624
I don't want to have kids.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.589
VANESSA:
Oh, I thought

08:22.632 --> 08:25.940
this would be the last gallon
I'd have to buy.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.811
You know, that,
you know, I-I could be

08:27.855 --> 08:30.118
one of those elegant women
who buys her milk

08:30.161 --> 08:33.600
one skinny quart at time.

08:33.643 --> 08:36.385
But Mandy and Kyle
are staying,

08:36.428 --> 08:40.215
so I guess I'm still
"Ugly Jugs" Vanessa.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.700
Honey... your jugs
are beautiful.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.180
Hey.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.747
-Ooh, actually...
-Uh-uh-uh...

08:50.791 --> 08:52.140
What? I'm thirsty.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.664
Drink water.
Milk is for movers.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.234
I think what your father
is trying to say is

08:59.277 --> 09:01.715
what the hell are you and Kyle
still doing here?

09:01.758 --> 09:04.848
Hey, hey. [chuckles]I can't wait to get out of here.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.415
Right back at ya.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.634
The problem is this family is

09:07.677 --> 09:10.724
too loving and too supportive.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.464
Boy. That's gonna be
an interesting call

09:12.508 --> 09:14.031
to social services.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.296
Well, you guys know Kyle
grew up with an alcoholic mom

09:18.340 --> 09:19.863
in a condemned trailer.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.648
And then he comes here
to a... to a caring,

09:21.691 --> 09:23.214
supportive family.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.739
I-I think maybe
he wants more of that.

09:25.782 --> 09:28.393
Well, does explain why Kyle's
been dragging his heels.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.091
-I mean, it's kind of sweet.
-Yeah.

09:30.134 --> 09:33.268
So I created a wonderful home
and family

09:33.311 --> 09:35.052
and, once again,

09:35.096 --> 09:37.664
being too good at something
bites me in the ass.

09:37.707 --> 09:40.797
Yeah, and those
three pregnancies

09:40.841 --> 09:44.496
hardly took any toll at all
on your figure.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.024
-Retail area.
-Uh-huh?

09:50.067 --> 09:52.287
There's a guy in a black leatherjacket with lots of buckles.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.288
-Uh.
-Lots of buckles.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.463
-Got him.
-Uh-huh.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.986
-Did you see him lift something?-No, no, no.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.510
Do you think I could pull off
a coat like that?

09:58.554 --> 10:01.905
Only in
a cherry red convertible.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.994
[chuckles]

10:04.038 --> 10:06.518
Oh, uh, okay. Uh-oh.
Boyd's here.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.869
-It's happening.
-Huh. Oh.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.697
What-what, wait, wait, wait.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.960
That's the first place
he'll look for you. Come on.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.269
-Okay.
-Yeah.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.709
Shh, shh.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.930
Ed? Chuck?

10:26.974 --> 10:29.585
Hey, where are you guys?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.022
It's a perfect idea.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.808
This way he can't shake down
people he can't find.

10:34.851 --> 10:38.899
Yeah. You know,
I stared down the Iraqi army.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.162
Now I'm hiding
from a peewee music man.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.167
But the Iraqi army
wasn't singing show tunes.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.082
[phone ringing]

10:48.125 --> 10:49.605
Come on, stop that.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.563
-Come on, cut it, cut it,
cut it, cut it.
-I got it. Whoa.

10:51.607 --> 10:54.349
Ooh.

10:54.392 --> 10:55.350
I got it.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.787
Turn the damn thing...

10:57.831 --> 10:59.528
-There it is. Okay.
-Turn the damn thing off.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.574
What are you guys doing?

11:02.618 --> 11:05.621
-Chuck just dropped his phone.
-Uh...

11:05.665 --> 11:08.058
Why is it so dark in here?

11:08.102 --> 11:10.539
-Uh, because the lights
aren't on.
-Yeah.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.454
-Ed, Ed, I told you,
turn the lights on.
-Okay.

11:14.369 --> 11:17.328
-Whoa. It's bright.
-Let me ask you
a question, fellas.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.373
-Yeah?
-Yeah?

11:18.416 --> 11:20.941
Do you love love?

11:20.984 --> 11:23.987
BOTH:
Yes.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.860
Well, then, you're going
to love the story

11:26.903 --> 11:29.601
of a flimflam man
who travels town to town

11:29.645 --> 11:30.907
selling musical instruments

11:30.951 --> 11:34.215
till one thing gets in his way.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.217
What do you think that is?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.915
BOTH:
Love.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.922
What's with the picnic basket?

11:45.966 --> 11:48.925
We usually go to the woods
with guns.

11:48.969 --> 11:52.537
This is for Kyle.He's having a hard time leaving.

11:52.581 --> 11:55.323
Then take him to the woods
with guns.

11:55.366 --> 11:59.588
Your father has agreed to let meexplain to Kyle

11:59.631 --> 12:02.460
-that family is family
no matter where he lives.
-MIKE: Right.

12:02.504 --> 12:03.897
You know, sometimes
I just prefer

12:03.940 --> 12:05.637
to rip the Band-Aid off,
all right?

12:05.681 --> 12:08.815
Damn it, I don't even like
putting Band-Aids on.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.947
You'll see, you'll see.
Once I talk to Kyle,

12:10.991 --> 12:13.689
he will realize on his own
that it's time to go.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.169
Right. Or he'll just
wait us out,

12:15.212 --> 12:17.475
take the master bedroom
after we die.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.044
Then I'll take him
to the woods with guns.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.916
What?

12:22.959 --> 12:25.919
Uh, Kyle... Hey.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.225
Uh, I packed this picnic basket

12:28.269 --> 12:30.271
full of all
your favorite snacks.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.621
-My favorite snac...
-Yeah.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.797
I thought they discontinued
making choco-balls

12:34.841 --> 12:38.845
like ten years ago
because they caused "lesions."

12:38.888 --> 12:41.369
Heh. No, no, no, no.
No choco-balls. Okay, so...

12:41.412 --> 12:44.851
Um, I just thought that
maybe you and Mandy

12:44.894 --> 12:46.853
could take the picnic
basket outside,

12:46.896 --> 12:50.944
and you could realize that
food tastes just as good

12:50.987 --> 12:52.467
no matter where you eat it.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.948
That's not true.
I mean, there's something

12:54.991 --> 12:56.950
that's just so magical
about your kitchen,

12:56.993 --> 12:59.691
and nobody beats
Mr. B's waffles.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.433
That's very nice, but, uh, but

13:02.477 --> 13:04.044
what I'm trying
to tell you is that...

13:04.087 --> 13:05.741
The only thing that my mom
cooked in the kitchen was

13:05.785 --> 13:07.612
this weird stuff
that made her friends

13:07.656 --> 13:11.007
really excited
to clean the trailer.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.183
Yeah, uh...

13:13.227 --> 13:15.751
look, I realize your childhood

13:15.795 --> 13:17.535
wasn't exactly ideal...

13:17.579 --> 13:20.974
Yeah, but it's okay now,'cause living here with you guys

13:21.017 --> 13:24.194
has been the happiest time
of my life.

13:24.238 --> 13:27.067
Which is why I'm not sure
I'm ever gonna leave.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.070
Mike.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.555
Listen, Kyle, I'm gonna get
ahold of the moving van.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.993
It'll be here in an hour.
Your stuff's gonna be in it

13:40.036 --> 13:41.864
or in the front yard.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.910
Now, get out.

13:46.564 --> 13:49.132
That Band-Aid had
a little hair on it.

13:59.186 --> 14:02.972
I can't believe I have my own
beautiful, perfect apartment.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.801
I want to kick you guys
out of here so badly.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.716
Okay, well, a few
last-minute things.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.152
Uh, the curtains will
be in tomorrow.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.938
Oh, and there is a bus that
stops by every few days

14:11.981 --> 14:14.766
because we are on
the "Haunted Denver" tour.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.986
Prison murder.
Don't ask.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.075
Oh, where do you want
the bowling balls?

14:20.294 --> 14:21.948
That's the last one.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.906
Now all that's left
is back surgery

14:23.950 --> 14:26.822
and three months
of physical therapy.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.519
Hey, how about your new landlordbuys everybody lunch

14:28.563 --> 14:30.086
at the Grill?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.828
I can get us a good table.
I sleep with the manager.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.092
[chuckles]Oh, don't tell her I said that.

14:36.136 --> 14:39.182
Maybe Dad could join us.
He likes to pay for things.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.967
Actually, I'm-I'm not hungry.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.969
-I think I'll just
get started unpacking.
-Okay.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.188
What about you, Eve?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.147
Uh, I think I'll hang here, too.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.410
I lost my appetite
when I fused my spine.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.546
Kyle, um, I think
you and I need to talk.

14:55.590 --> 14:58.941
You know, Baxter son
to Baxter son.

14:58.985 --> 15:02.989
Apparently I'm not a Baxter son.

15:04.599 --> 15:07.341
Which... which I suppose
is a good thing,

15:07.384 --> 15:09.038
since I'm married
to a Baxter daughter,

15:09.082 --> 15:12.563
and that would be,
you know... disgusting.

15:12.607 --> 15:15.175
Well, Dad thinks of you
as a son.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.655
Oh, yeah?

15:17.699 --> 15:19.440
Sure has a funny way
of showing it.

15:19.483 --> 15:23.096
Well, he has a funny way
of showing most things.

15:23.139 --> 15:26.186
You kind of have to learn
how to read him.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.188
He kicked me out.
An-And I don't know why.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.798
I don't know what I did wrong.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.539
You didn't do anything wrong.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.758
That's why he kicked you out.
Don't you get that?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.369
Okay, this might be
a little late in the game

15:35.412 --> 15:37.153
for me to ask this,
since, you know,

15:37.197 --> 15:39.808
-I'm married into
the family and all.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.463
But... are you people insane?

15:44.508 --> 15:47.033
Kyle, he knew it was time
for you to move out.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.469
He knew you were ready.

15:48.512 --> 15:50.036
That's why,
when he found out

15:50.079 --> 15:52.690
that you weren't going
to pull the trigger, he did.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.605
And if there's one thing
Dad knows,

15:54.649 --> 15:57.869
it's... it's when to pull
the trigger.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.697
I guess that's true.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.612
Of course it's true.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.614
And you want to know
another thing that's true?

16:03.658 --> 16:06.226
You think you moving out
is hard on you?

16:06.269 --> 16:09.098
Trust me,
it's way harder on Dad.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.406
You think so?

16:12.449 --> 16:14.277
I do.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.323
That's why I know how
to read him.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.109
You're a good brother, Eve.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.287
You think you could teach me
how to read?

16:24.331 --> 16:26.115
Sure.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.077
You mean my dad, right?

16:34.863 --> 16:38.258
Hey, guys, I'm back.

16:38.301 --> 16:42.044
Me, too, and I brought
more muffins.

16:42.088 --> 16:45.134
Now, Ed, you bought
the "Shipoopi" package.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.876
That gives you four tickets
to each performance,

16:47.919 --> 16:50.052
and a special lunch
with the cast.

16:50.096 --> 16:53.708
I know what I did.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.493
-And, Mr. Larabee.
Now, now this is my favorite.
-Mm.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.930
-You get...
-To build a gazebo.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.498
I know.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.544
Oh, you're gonna need
an insurance waiver.

17:03.587 --> 17:07.330
What?
An insurance waiver?

17:07.374 --> 17:09.158
[chuckles]
If it helps, uh,

17:09.202 --> 17:11.204
we have to host the cast party.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.902
46 drama nerds spilling soda
and spreading it

17:13.945 --> 17:17.210
all over my house
with their jazz hands.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.429
I just bought myself
another year

17:19.473 --> 17:22.476
to try to figure out
how to say no to that kid.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.869
Next year they're doing Cats.

17:24.913 --> 17:27.785
-[sighs]
-Oh, for the love of God.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.222
A-Am I gonna have to build
some kind of

17:29.265 --> 17:31.137
giant litter box or something?

17:33.008 --> 17:34.357
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, hey, Jen, Jen, Jen.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.795
Don't take this the wrong way,
but get out.

17:37.839 --> 17:40.320
Boyd's gonna get here
any second.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.322
He's fundraising
for his new play, so get...

17:42.365 --> 17:44.106
Hey, that's my kid.
But he's right.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.499
You should totally
just leave right now. Just go.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.543
ED:
It's too late, too late,

17:46.587 --> 17:48.371
-too late.
-Oh, Jen, great.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.938
Let me ask you a question.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.984
-Do you love love?
-Why?

17:53.028 --> 17:55.509
Because if you do, you're goingto love The Music Man.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.772
-It's the story of a guy...
-Stop.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.339
-What?
-Not interested.

17:59.382 --> 18:03.778
-But don't you want to know...
-I do not.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.217
But it-it's a musical.

18:08.261 --> 18:11.220
Yeah, people don't like those.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.310
Let's go, Boyd.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.617
Uh... think we're done here.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.575
[chuckles]

18:18.619 --> 18:21.404
That is the most amazing thing

18:21.448 --> 18:22.797
I've ever seen.

18:24.015 --> 18:26.017
You don't seem to feel
any guilt.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.497
How d-how did you do that?

18:27.541 --> 18:30.413
Well, I'll tell you.
Right after I tell you

18:30.457 --> 18:33.590
about the geology club, which israising money for a field trip.

18:39.205 --> 18:42.077
You two strike me
as the type who would be...

18:42.121 --> 18:43.209
Limestone Members.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.168
Hey, you got a check...

18:51.217 --> 18:53.567
Hello?

18:53.610 --> 18:55.960
Hey, Kyle. Kyle.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.571
In the box?

18:58.615 --> 19:01.227
Oh, hey, Mr. B.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.663
Hey, buddy.

19:02.706 --> 19:05.361
You know, this place is startingto look pretty good.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.103
Yeah, yeah, it's starting
to feel like home.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.670
That's because it is a home.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.193
Can I get you anything?

19:11.237 --> 19:14.588
No, but, uh,
I brought you something.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.030
This is yours.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.901
Yeah. Family heirloom.

19:23.945 --> 19:27.427
Oh. Cool. I'll-I'll tell Mandy
you brought it by for her.

19:27.470 --> 19:31.082
Actually, uh,
I brought it for you, Kyle.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.694
-Really?
-You, uh...

19:33.737 --> 19:36.262
Vanessa's got a loom, but...
that's stupid.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.266
Heirloom good.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.269
A loom, stupid.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.359
-Thank you, Mr. B.
-Mm-hmm.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.230
Any time you want a waffle,
you come by.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.711
Okay. Listen, I, uh...

19:50.754 --> 19:52.713
I should get back to work.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.237
A-And do you remember
how I like the waffles?

19:55.281 --> 19:58.109
Hard on the outside,
soft on the inside.

19:58.153 --> 20:00.329
You know how to read me.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.433
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

20:17.477 --> 20:21.481
reminding you that the outdoorshas much to teach us.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.397
For example, you know one thingyou'll never see in nature?

20:24.440 --> 20:27.487
A millennial
still living at home.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.316
And you know why?
It isn't good for them.

20:30.359 --> 20:33.101
Buy your own damn milk.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.191
You see,
it really doesn't matter

20:36.235 --> 20:38.324
if the teat is attached
to your mom,

20:38.367 --> 20:41.196
an almond or the government.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.067
If you suckle at it
for too long,

20:43.111 --> 20:45.548
you won't know how to be
a grown-up in the real world.

20:45.592 --> 20:46.897
Of course, in nature,

20:46.941 --> 20:50.336
the parents don't mess around.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.469
Birds will just launch the kid
out of the nest.

20:53.513 --> 20:56.559
They don't even check to see ifthe dude can fly. They're like,

20:56.603 --> 20:58.648
"Well, you got a couple secondsto figure it out,

20:58.692 --> 21:01.172
otherwise you're gonna
get eaten down there."

21:02.348 --> 21:04.393
With people,
it's a little trickier.

21:04.437 --> 21:05.568
Especially the-the people

21:05.612 --> 21:08.310
your very loving wife
gave birth to.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.486
If you're really lucky, your
grown-up kid who lives at home

21:10.530 --> 21:13.272
will get married, and you get
to take in a stray.

21:14.490 --> 21:18.407
It's like
birth one, get one free.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.888
You ever see those videos
where the goat folds in

21:20.931 --> 21:24.195
with the family dogs
until he thinks he's a dog?

21:24.239 --> 21:26.328
Well... [imitates goat]

21:26.372 --> 21:28.591
...we had a goat.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.724
He thought he was one of us.

21:30.767 --> 21:33.466
Thought he was one of us.
[chuckles]

21:33.509 --> 21:36.469
And I hope that he knows
that he is

21:36.512 --> 21:38.209
and always will be.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.603
Baxter out.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.622
Then here are a few more shows to check out from Fox.

22:01.537 --> 22:02.799
ANNOUNCER: It'’s outrageous.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.018
