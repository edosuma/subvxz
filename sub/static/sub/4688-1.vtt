00:28.216 --> 00:31.218
Girls, your mother and I
are getting divorced.

00:31.220 --> 00:32.720
Don't cry.

00:32.722 --> 00:34.988
I know you're upset.
I know you're confused.

00:34.990 --> 00:36.723
I don't know
what your mother told you,

00:36.725 --> 00:38.759
but let me explain it
from my side,

00:38.761 --> 00:41.861
in terms you can understand.

00:44.565 --> 00:47.260
You got your doll, right?
You got your doll there.

00:47.286 --> 00:47.934
Yeah.

00:47.936 --> 00:49.509
You got your doll. You
like your doll, right?

00:49.535 --> 00:49.902
Yes.

00:49.904 --> 00:51.671
- You love your doll.
- Yeah.

00:51.673 --> 00:53.305
Yes, you love the doll.

00:53.307 --> 00:55.807
But what if I told you...

00:55.809 --> 00:58.690
that was the only doll you're allowed
to play with the rest of your life?

00:59.578 --> 01:02.314
- How would you feel?
- Sad.

01:02.316 --> 01:04.416
You'd feel sad. Of course.

01:04.418 --> 01:06.317
'Cause there's a lot of
other dolls on your shelves.

01:06.319 --> 01:09.254
And if you play with the other dolls,
you can't have that doll anymore.

01:09.256 --> 01:11.990
Even though that doll doesn't really
want to play with you at this point.

01:11.992 --> 01:14.326
You're both living a lie.

01:14.328 --> 01:17.796
There's other dolls you like, and
they're making new dolls every year.

01:17.798 --> 01:20.199
- You want a stewardess doll?
- Yeah.

01:20.201 --> 01:23.635
What about a slightly overweight
cocktail waitress doll? - Yeah.

01:23.637 --> 01:26.338
What about a doll who happens to be
best friends with your main doll?

01:26.340 --> 01:28.139
Yeah. It could happen, right?

01:28.141 --> 01:29.607
Yeah.

01:29.609 --> 01:31.775
A doll you only play with
one day and never see again?

01:31.777 --> 01:33.277
Yeah!

01:33.279 --> 01:35.379
What about a doll where your
friend's playing with a doll,

01:35.381 --> 01:38.716
and he needs you to, you know, kind
of man up with the other doll.

01:38.718 --> 01:40.884
You don't even wanna play
with that doll, but you do it...

01:40.886 --> 01:42.518
'cause your friend's
playing with that doll.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.387
You don't wanna sit there and
leave the other doll unattended.

01:44.389 --> 01:46.122
Yeah.

01:46.124 --> 01:48.657
So that's why me and Mom
are getting divorced.

01:48.659 --> 01:51.527
Monogamy isn't realistic.

01:51.529 --> 01:54.396
Monogamy isn't realistic.

01:54.398 --> 01:57.699
- Again!
- Monogamy isn't realistic.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.701
Again!

02:03.140 --> 02:05.039
I never do this.

02:05.041 --> 02:08.074
This is <i> so</i> weird for me.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.983
I really like these ones.

02:16.985 --> 02:19.051
Oh, no!

02:19.053 --> 02:20.820
Shit!

02:20.822 --> 02:22.688
- That's your dick?
- Uh-huh.

02:22.690 --> 02:26.658
Too big! Your dick doesn't end.

02:26.660 --> 02:29.594
Why doesn't your dick end?

02:29.596 --> 02:31.529
Have you ever fucked
someone before?

02:31.531 --> 02:33.932
Where is she buried?

02:33.934 --> 02:36.935
That looks like the whole
cast of <i> Game of Thrones.</i>

02:36.937 --> 02:39.405
Come here.

02:42.875 --> 02:44.676
Um, you know what? Huh?

02:44.678 --> 02:47.178
I'm, like, really shy. Uh-huh.

02:47.180 --> 02:50.915
So we should probably do this first so
I, like, feel comfortable with you.

02:50.917 --> 02:52.216
Yeah, all right. You know?

02:52.218 --> 02:53.884
It's just... Mm.

02:53.886 --> 02:55.752
A little warm-up. I know.
Yeah, a little warm-up.

02:55.754 --> 02:57.354
Hey, you taste like mango.

02:57.356 --> 02:59.122
Just stop talking, okay? Okay.

02:59.124 --> 03:01.190
Just, like... What are you...

03:01.192 --> 03:03.026
Just do the alphabet.

03:03.028 --> 03:05.962
Just hang up at the top. Everything
important's up at the top.

03:05.964 --> 03:07.930
Yeah, that's good.

03:07.932 --> 03:09.966
Okay.

03:18.742 --> 03:21.109
Hey, you like that, right?

03:22.778 --> 03:24.378
Amy?

03:24.380 --> 03:26.247
Hey.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.881
I think it's my turn, baby.

03:27.883 --> 03:32.118
Amy. Seriously, my turn.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.080
Muffin, remember you said
you were gonna...

03:38.392 --> 03:39.557
Okay.

03:45.598 --> 03:47.599
<i>Hey, guys, I'm Amy.</i>

03:47.601 --> 03:49.801
<i>Don't judge me, fuckers!</i>

03:49.803 --> 03:51.770
<i>I'm just a sexual girl, okay?</i>

03:51.772 --> 03:54.973
<i>I am fine. I am in control.</i>

03:54.975 --> 03:58.577
Okay, bye. <i>This is clearly
not my first rodeo.</i>

03:58.579 --> 04:01.980
<i>The key is to never ever,
let them sleep over.</i>

04:01.982 --> 04:05.351
Tell you what, I got a couple of ticks,
uh, to The Black Keys, Thursday, if you...

04:05.353 --> 04:06.785
Ooh, thanks.

04:06.787 --> 04:08.320
Bye.

04:09.322 --> 04:11.823
All right, good night.

04:11.825 --> 04:13.857
All right, bye. Good night. Oh.

04:15.694 --> 04:18.028
I guess I do love pussy.

04:20.632 --> 04:23.967
<i>Look, I have a great job
and my apartment's sick...</i>

04:23.969 --> 04:25.702
<i>and my friends and family
are awesome,</i>

04:25.704 --> 04:28.005
<i>and I'm sort of
seeing someone...</i>

04:28.007 --> 04:30.140
<i>and this dude's not him.</i>

04:32.044 --> 04:34.044
<i>This guy is who I'm seeing.</i>

04:34.046 --> 04:35.645
<i>Kind of.</i>

04:35.647 --> 04:37.880
<i>He's hot, right?</i>

04:37.882 --> 04:40.950
<i>He is great, but it is like
fucking an ice sculpture.</i>

04:45.322 --> 04:47.556
<i>Okay, so I broke
the sleepover rule.</i>

04:47.558 --> 04:49.357
<i>Where am I?</i>

04:49.359 --> 04:51.326
Scarface <i> poster? Ugh.</i>

04:51.328 --> 04:53.795
<i>Please don't be a dorm room.
Please don't be a dorm room.</i>

04:53.797 --> 04:56.198
There she is.
<i>Buenos d√≠as,</i> baby.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.401
Oh, my God! You
look like an angel.

04:59.403 --> 05:02.738
What time is it? It's
like 7:30 in the morning.

05:02.740 --> 05:05.307
I don't know if I should let you
sleep or not or make you breakfast.

05:05.309 --> 05:06.841
I chose breakfast.

05:06.843 --> 05:08.844
Where am I?

05:08.846 --> 05:10.478
Oh, you're in
Staten Island, sugar.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.246
What?

05:12.248 --> 05:14.482
Fuck!

05:14.484 --> 05:16.917
Hey, so when you think
I'm gonna see you again?

05:16.919 --> 05:18.585
Soon. Like really, really soon.

05:18.587 --> 05:20.921
You don't gotta rush off. Oh.

05:22.023 --> 05:23.590
My God. You're stunning.

05:23.592 --> 05:26.560
Thank you. Hey, so Saturday...

05:26.562 --> 05:28.495
Saturday my aunt
is getting married,

05:28.497 --> 05:30.263
and she's having
a little barbecue beforehand,

05:30.265 --> 05:32.399
and I would love it
if you were my date, baby.

05:32.401 --> 05:35.068
Like, if I walked in with you,
oh, my God,

05:35.070 --> 05:40.040
Johnny would be like, "Yo!
Oli, what's up, kid? Great."

05:40.042 --> 05:43.043
Like, who's that piece, you know?
She's body down."

05:43.045 --> 05:46.213
I don't know what that means,
but, like, I can't do that...

05:46.215 --> 05:50.351
because, like, you and I won't
ever see each other again.

05:50.353 --> 05:54.187
I didn't think you were gonna follow
up so quick about hanging out,

05:54.189 --> 05:56.456
but this is it for us.
Well, but...

05:56.458 --> 05:58.524
Our journey is over.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.893
Like it just ends here...
Till Saturday.

06:00.895 --> 06:03.263
No... Our journey is over now...

06:03.265 --> 06:05.231
because I probably won't see you
because I gotta get to work...

06:05.233 --> 06:09.703
and you gotta go be fine as hell.
Good-bye.

06:09.705 --> 06:12.739
I got Bikram yoga, so...

06:12.741 --> 06:15.242
Hey, you can say whatever you
want, baby, but hips don't lie.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.277
Hey, check your Twitter.
I might Direct Message you.

06:17.279 --> 06:18.778
Might DM.

06:19.913 --> 06:23.649
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

07:11.764 --> 07:13.663
Noam, watch out. Good morning.

07:13.665 --> 07:16.633
Oh, Amy!
There she is, my princess.

07:16.635 --> 07:18.301
What happened?
Did church let out early?

07:18.303 --> 07:19.869
Ha-ha.

07:19.871 --> 07:21.671
Hey! Amy, where you going?

07:21.673 --> 07:23.339
This isn't Planned Parenthood.

07:30.113 --> 07:31.981
Oh, my God! Shut up.

07:31.983 --> 07:33.849
You have to tell me
everything about last night.

07:33.851 --> 07:37.319
I went on your Instagram.
That guy is, like, so hot.

07:37.321 --> 07:39.789
He looks kind of like
a white Drake. No.

07:39.791 --> 07:42.491
He was like a Puerto Rican Gollum.
I'm not talking about it.

07:42.493 --> 07:44.627
Do you have to pee?
Yeah, totally.

07:46.797 --> 07:48.931
Did you hear Johnny Depp is
coming into the office today?

07:48.957 --> 07:49.999
Oh, yeah. I'm all over that.

07:50.001 --> 07:52.901
Which version of Johnny Depp
you most wanna have sex with?

07:52.903 --> 07:55.703
Like, which one does it for you the most?
'Cause I can't stop thinking about it.

07:55.705 --> 07:57.539
For me, it's
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

07:57.541 --> 07:59.474
Like, I love a fully made up,
Really?

07:59.476 --> 08:02.811
Long hair, like, almost
feminine-looking Johnny Depp.

08:02.813 --> 08:05.513
Not "almost." Like, he looks like
a beautiful woman in that movie.

08:05.515 --> 08:07.481
Yeah. Who would be yours?

08:07.483 --> 08:10.384
I'm picking, like, an <i> Edward
Scissorhands</i> Johnny Depp.

08:10.386 --> 08:12.219
You would get totally cut up.

08:12.221 --> 08:14.222
Like, you... Yeah, but he'd
feel so bad about it...

08:14.224 --> 08:15.823
that he'd be, like,
"I'll never leave you."

08:15.825 --> 08:18.926
And I would get, like, a sick haircut.
Yeah, yeah.

08:18.928 --> 08:21.863
But also, guess what. Willy
Wonka, like, bring it on.

08:21.865 --> 08:23.664
Oh, my God. Totally. Right?

08:23.666 --> 08:27.268
Would... Yeah. Would fuck the shit
out of Willy Wonka Johnny Depp.

08:27.270 --> 08:30.004
Okay, my babes,
I want your undivided.

08:30.006 --> 08:33.207
I've been looking at your pitches,
and these are my thoughts.

08:33.210 --> 08:37.044
Nikki. Why are you smiling?

08:37.047 --> 08:39.748
I'm not smiling.
I'm just very nervous.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.383
Stop smiling. Stop smiling.

08:42.385 --> 08:44.184
That's even more.

08:44.187 --> 08:44.774
Nikki.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.121
The more nervous I get,
the more I smile, so...

08:47.123 --> 08:49.056
Stop smiling.

08:49.058 --> 08:51.626
Stop it. Stop it.

08:51.628 --> 08:53.928
Nikki, shut it down. Come on.
Bring it down.

08:53.954 --> 08:54.695
Bring it down.

08:54.697 --> 08:56.197
That's it.

08:56.199 --> 08:58.132
I'm sick of your
ginger nonsense.

08:58.134 --> 09:00.868
I don't want to see
those gnashers. No.

09:00.870 --> 09:02.537
Stop it. What's this?

09:02.539 --> 09:04.438
That's our new intern, Donald.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.440
Thought we were getting
a chick, but he's here.

09:06.442 --> 09:08.643
Okay. Welcome, Donald.

09:08.645 --> 09:11.078
Welcome to <i> S'nuff,</i> where we are
teaching the strong-willed man...

09:11.080 --> 09:12.913
how to dress, think, eat, fuck.

09:12.915 --> 09:15.249
Do you like the magazine, Donald?
Oh, yeah.

09:15.251 --> 09:17.384
It's pretty much all I read.
Good answer.

09:17.386 --> 09:21.155
Look. This is ours. This is ours.
Right. We made this.

09:21.157 --> 09:24.124
- What's our demographic?
- Every-fucking-one.

09:24.126 --> 09:25.893
Yeah.

09:25.895 --> 09:27.261
Thank you. You can go now.

09:27.263 --> 09:29.997
Yeah, thank you.
It's a big opportunity, so...

09:29.999 --> 09:33.501
- Right. Pitch me.
- Pitch me hard.

09:33.503 --> 09:35.669
Schultz? So I was thinking
of something called...

09:35.671 --> 09:37.905
the <i> "S'nuff</i> Guide
to Beating Off at Work."

09:37.907 --> 09:40.807
Where to do it, how to do
it, how not to get caught.

09:40.809 --> 09:43.509
How to get caught.
Makes it more fun, yeah.

09:43.511 --> 09:47.180
I already started
the research, you guys.

09:47.182 --> 09:48.848
- Bryson?
- Okay, I got one.

09:48.850 --> 09:50.684
"You're Not Gay. She's Boring."

09:50.686 --> 09:52.085
Good. Yeah?

09:52.087 --> 09:53.920
- Fantastic. I can see it.
- Thank you.

09:53.922 --> 09:55.688
Okay, I have another to pitch.

09:55.690 --> 09:57.424
Maybe a cover, I don't know.

09:57.426 --> 10:00.460
Uh, "You Call Those Tits?"

10:00.462 --> 10:02.262
That's good. Yeah.

10:02.264 --> 10:05.198
And then, maybe, like, a "Where
Are They Now?" piece about, uh,

10:05.200 --> 10:07.333
the kids Michael Jackson
gave settlements to.

10:07.335 --> 10:08.501
Good. Ooh!

10:08.503 --> 10:10.870
I wanna know.
That's good, yeah.

10:10.872 --> 10:13.005
I play ice hockey with one of them.
I'll get an e-mail.

10:13.007 --> 10:14.874
Yeah, that's good. Right.

10:14.876 --> 10:18.644
So, assignments. Schultz, you're
on the Ryan Phillippe piece.

10:18.646 --> 10:20.980
Oh, what? Yes!<i> Crash</i> was epic.

10:20.982 --> 10:23.716
I was thinking I would take
a stab at the Phillippe piece.

10:23.718 --> 10:26.553
No, no. Ryan, I tell you,
he's in a major funk right now,

10:26.555 --> 10:30.856
and he will respond much better to a male
who is neither attractive nor masculine.

10:30.858 --> 10:33.459
Blam! That's me right here.

10:33.461 --> 10:36.061
Bryson, I've got a red mark by your name.
Why would that be?

10:36.063 --> 10:39.632
Yes, okay. I am pitching
Dr. Aaron Conners.

10:39.634 --> 10:41.300
Uh, he works with
some of the Knicks.

10:41.302 --> 10:45.171
He's this incredible, young
sports physician on the rise,

10:45.173 --> 10:49.307
and he just created this revolutionary knee
insert that cuts recovery time in half.

10:49.309 --> 10:51.510
He's about to perform it on
Amar'e Stoudemire.

10:51.512 --> 10:53.845
It'll be the first time it's
ever been done on a pro athlete.

10:53.847 --> 10:56.682
If we get this, we'll have access
to the biggest names in sports.

10:56.684 --> 10:59.484
LeBron, Durant, Blake Griffin.

10:59.486 --> 11:02.087
I've heard of this guy. He did
D'Brickashaw Ferguson's knee, right?

11:02.089 --> 11:04.589
Yes. Yeah, and Metta
World Peace's too.

11:04.591 --> 11:07.325
Yeah, Thabo Sefolosha owes
his whole career to this guy.

11:07.327 --> 11:09.528
Are these real names?
What's that, Amy?

11:09.530 --> 11:11.997
Your thoughts?
I'd... I'm sorry. I just...

11:11.999 --> 11:15.001
I don't know why we treat
these athletes like heroes...

11:15.003 --> 11:18.437
just 'cause they can skate fast
or kick a ball in a net.

11:18.439 --> 11:20.072
I just think that it's weird.
No offense.

11:20.074 --> 11:23.108
I just think that
sports are stupid...

11:23.110 --> 11:28.714
and anyone who likes them is
just, like, a lesser person...

11:28.716 --> 11:30.615
and has a small intellect.

11:34.554 --> 11:37.188
Killer. I want you
to write the piece.

11:37.190 --> 11:39.424
What? What?

11:39.426 --> 11:42.126
Oh, no, no. I literally
can't stomach sports.

11:42.128 --> 11:44.229
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Your opposition is perfection.

11:44.231 --> 11:45.863
This really feels like
a Bryson article.

11:45.865 --> 11:47.698
Yeah, this feels
like a "me" article.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.734
- I pitched it.
- You pitched it. I'm giving it to Amy.

11:49.736 --> 11:51.569
What are you saying? Giving me attitude?
I can do...

11:51.571 --> 11:54.405
This isn't a fucking medical journal.
I can do opposition.

11:54.407 --> 11:56.541
- I can do sexy.
- I want that.

11:56.543 --> 11:58.543
I want that hatred.

11:58.545 --> 12:01.579
I'm giving it to Amy. Don't sulk at me.
I'm not sulking. I'm...

12:01.581 --> 12:05.350
This is my decision. I am
giving it to Amy. Sure. Fine.

12:06.985 --> 12:08.453
I can do sexy though. Sorry?

12:08.455 --> 12:09.720
Huh? What?

12:09.722 --> 12:12.155
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- I'm just...

12:12.157 --> 12:13.824
having fun.

12:15.259 --> 12:17.593
Nikki, I want you to research...

12:17.595 --> 12:20.163
whether garlic makes
semen taste any different.

12:20.165 --> 12:24.500
Oh. Um, how am I supposed
to get the... Thank you.

12:24.502 --> 12:26.536
You inspire me.

12:28.472 --> 12:30.172
It tastes the same.

12:32.109 --> 12:36.444
Amy. I'm not trying
to punish you.

12:36.446 --> 12:38.146
Does it feel a little like I am?

12:38.148 --> 12:39.947
Uh, no, no. I appreciate the...

12:39.949 --> 12:43.150
Well, you know, I know you want
to branch out and cover more.

12:43.152 --> 12:47.021
And you do know I'm looking for a
new executive editor, don't you?

12:47.023 --> 12:48.956
I do know that,
and I'm very, very interested.

12:48.958 --> 12:51.125
I'd love to be considered.

12:51.127 --> 12:54.261
Uh, especially... My dad's
house, like, isn't selling,

12:54.263 --> 12:58.099
and my sister and I just had to put
him in this assisted living place.

12:58.101 --> 12:59.905
And you would think it
was, like, the Waldorf.

12:59.931 --> 13:00.634
It's so expensive.

13:00.636 --> 13:03.717
Is this your one-woman show right now?
'Cause I ain't got a ticket.

13:06.140 --> 13:08.375
You know,
just eviscerate the piece.

13:08.377 --> 13:10.510
I'm giving you an assignment.
Right, yeah.

13:10.512 --> 13:13.012
Hmm? And, Amy, if you would...

13:13.014 --> 13:15.849
teach this about this.

13:19.453 --> 13:23.789
So, does she have a foreign
accent, or is she just awesome?

13:25.859 --> 13:28.339
Don't talk to me for two weeks.

13:30.463 --> 13:33.799
<i>That's my sister, Kim.
She's cute, right?</i>

13:33.801 --> 13:37.536
<i>Well, back off!
She's totally married as fuck.</i>

13:37.538 --> 13:39.805
<i>Our dad's MS
has gotten really bad,</i>

13:39.807 --> 13:41.673
<i>so he can't live
by himself anymore.</i>

13:41.675 --> 13:43.976
<i>We're cleaning out his house.</i>

13:43.978 --> 13:45.644
There's your box.

13:45.646 --> 13:47.178
So that stuff's Goodwill,
that stuff's eBay,

13:47.180 --> 13:48.746
and that stuff
up front is trash.

13:48.748 --> 13:51.249
This is... This stuff's eBay?
Yeah.

13:51.251 --> 13:54.018
We should go... I wanna go through this.
No, don't go through it.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.887
That's stuff we can
make money off of.

13:57.089 --> 13:58.823
Why are they here?

13:58.825 --> 14:01.025
They're picking me up.

14:01.027 --> 14:03.194
Hey, Mother, look!
We got a croquet set.

14:03.196 --> 14:05.596
Great job, sweet pea!

14:05.598 --> 14:08.266
He calls you "Mother"? That's not creepy.
Yeah, it was his choice.

14:08.268 --> 14:10.935
Have him call you "Stepmother."
It's more accurate.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.605
- I've raised that child!
- Mom, I found a glove.

14:13.607 --> 14:15.707
Hey, buddy. How you doing? Good.

14:15.709 --> 14:17.775
What are you, uh,
studying in school?

14:17.777 --> 14:21.713
I'm learning about space
and all the celestial objects,

14:21.715 --> 14:24.716
and, you know, how there are
planets and solar systems...

14:24.718 --> 14:28.087
and sometimes there could be,
you know, multiple universes,

14:28.089 --> 14:30.889
but people don't know how to describe
that yet, but it's a new theory,

14:30.891 --> 14:33.425
and I'm so excited to see
if they figured it out or not.

14:34.894 --> 14:36.961
Great.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.631
See you around.

14:39.633 --> 14:41.366
Okay.

14:42.968 --> 14:44.769
Why is he dressed
like Colonel Sanders?

14:44.771 --> 14:46.804
He got to dress himself
and that's what he chose.

14:46.806 --> 14:48.772
That's what the inside of his
heart looks like. Be nice.

14:48.774 --> 14:50.541
Can you just be real
for a second?

14:50.543 --> 14:53.210
I-If you just, like, met
that dude at, like, a CVS,

14:53.212 --> 14:54.811
you'd have a real
problem with him.

14:54.813 --> 14:57.513
Can you just pretend to like him?
I am pretending.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.716
Ooh, I like Tom's sweater.

15:00.718 --> 15:03.453
He's doing, like,
the <i> To Catch a Predator</i> look.

15:03.455 --> 15:04.887
Amy! What?

15:04.889 --> 15:06.989
Amy, what's up? Hey!

15:06.991 --> 15:10.593
Looking sharp. Looking sharp, man.
Thanks.

15:10.595 --> 15:12.261
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you.

15:12.263 --> 15:13.896
I was reading
your article about...

15:13.898 --> 15:15.430
how to talk your girlfriend
into a three-way.

15:15.432 --> 15:16.964
You read that one? Yeah.

15:16.966 --> 15:18.565
- Wow!
- Would you do that?

15:18.567 --> 15:20.134
Nope. No.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.503
Wow, that got off the table quick.
Yeah.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.439
Let him do what he wants. You guys
should make a sex tape. - I would.

15:25.441 --> 15:28.203
Uh... I did high school theater.
I think I'd be pretty good.

15:29.979 --> 15:32.013
This nursing home is nice.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.749
Yeah. It's too nice
and it's too expensive,

15:34.751 --> 15:37.351
and we should've put him in a shithole.
No. We did.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.953
No, I mean, it's a shithole.

15:38.955 --> 15:41.755
It's just like
the nicest shithole. Yeah.

15:41.757 --> 15:45.593
Places where the nurses don't
fuck the patients are expensive.

15:45.595 --> 15:48.028
That's what you're paying for.
It's not the food, sister.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.832
Ew! "Condoms ribbed
for his pleasure"?

15:51.834 --> 15:54.134
Ew. I better hold on to these.

15:54.136 --> 15:56.036
Is this coke? No.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.372
Dad didn't love coke. He was
just a full-blown alcoholic.

16:00.708 --> 16:02.975
No. It must just be from
like a Halloween costume.

16:02.977 --> 16:04.509
Oh.

16:06.144 --> 16:08.112
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Moving on.

16:08.114 --> 16:09.880
Okay, let's just...
Amy, don't touch it.

16:09.882 --> 16:11.281
These are his memories.

16:11.283 --> 16:13.316
No, don't do that!

16:13.318 --> 16:15.452
What? He needs his wallet.
Toss it away.

16:15.454 --> 16:17.654
We've got so much stuff to go through.
Please sto...

16:17.656 --> 16:19.723
Aw!

16:19.725 --> 16:22.692
Oh! He loves that poster.
Oh, I know.

16:24.127 --> 16:26.395
Kimberly! Stop it!

16:26.397 --> 16:29.131
Stop it! Girl, come on!

16:29.133 --> 16:31.867
Not cool, girl. That felt good.

16:33.169 --> 16:34.903
It's not right. Alaska.

16:34.905 --> 16:37.171
No! Don't throw away
his snow globes.

16:37.173 --> 16:39.874
These are his memories. He got
one of these everywhere he went.

16:39.876 --> 16:41.767
Does he have one for every
one of our teachers?

16:41.793 --> 16:42.476
I don't see them.

16:42.478 --> 16:44.979
He didn't fuck all of our teachers.
He fucked all of my teachers.

16:44.981 --> 16:47.715
No, he never fucked Mr. Hecht.

16:47.717 --> 16:49.149
I did.

16:49.151 --> 16:50.851
I'm just kidding.

16:50.853 --> 16:54.487
You know, he wouldn't, but...
Where's that?

16:54.489 --> 16:56.490
Mmm. Hamburg.

16:56.492 --> 16:58.591
Auschwitz. What?

17:00.427 --> 17:02.262
I guess they have a gift shop.
Hmm.

17:02.264 --> 17:04.763
Oh, man.

17:04.766 --> 17:06.766
Look at this.

17:11.005 --> 17:12.505
Mom was so fuckable then.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.041
She had the best tits.

17:16.044 --> 17:18.844
When she would lay down,
they would just stay put.

17:18.846 --> 17:20.880
Mine are just like, "See ya!"

17:20.882 --> 17:24.182
My titties are like, "Peace!"

17:26.051 --> 17:27.786
Dad was such a dick.

17:30.690 --> 17:34.125
Yeah, I don't really
see it that way.

17:43.903 --> 17:47.571
Can we mix it up a little bit?
Will you talk dirty to me?

17:47.573 --> 17:49.239
Come on. Uh, Amy, no.

17:49.241 --> 17:51.242
Come on! Just...
It's not something I do well.

17:51.244 --> 17:54.478
I'm not really verbal, okay? I'm
more physical in how I communicate.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.090
You're gonna be great.
I'm gonna sound stupid.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.048
I don't wanna sound stupid.

17:57.050 --> 18:00.051
You're not gonna sound stupid. Clear your
mind and say whatever pops in it, okay?

18:00.053 --> 18:02.554
Just try it. Just say anything.

18:02.556 --> 18:05.290
All right.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.958
I'm gonna give you
my full pecker.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.727
Yeah. Okay.

18:08.729 --> 18:12.464
'Cause of the pecs, but
pecker's kind of like my dick.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.100
Yeah, y-yeah, I got it. I understood
what you meant by "pecker."

18:15.102 --> 18:17.936
I'm gonna fill you with protein.

18:17.938 --> 18:22.007
Yeah. I'm gonna give you the protein you
need to survive when you're making muscles.

18:22.009 --> 18:23.575
I'm gonna put
my green drink in you.

18:23.577 --> 18:26.979
Yeah, beta-carotene
and vegetable mix.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.682
Can it not be about protein
or-or energy or nutrition?

18:30.684 --> 18:32.818
Can you just talk about
like sex stuff?

18:34.453 --> 18:37.087
- All right.
- Yes, okay. Just sexy stuff.

18:37.089 --> 18:38.823
Okay, here. All right.

18:38.825 --> 18:40.524
Talk to me.

18:40.526 --> 18:43.026
There's no "I" in "team."

18:43.028 --> 18:45.195
But there's an "I" in "win."

18:45.197 --> 18:49.599
Can't spell "victory"
without T-R-Y.

18:49.601 --> 18:52.368
Winning isn't everything.
It's the only thing.

18:52.370 --> 18:55.505
Okay. These are just phrases,
for, like, sports phrases.

18:55.507 --> 18:57.807
Are these Nike slogans?
Please, just...

18:57.809 --> 19:00.109
Do you want the "Just do it"?
Do you want that one? No!

19:00.111 --> 19:02.612
Just have... Just have sex with
me and say some dirty shit.

19:06.617 --> 19:09.785
What... Wha... What is that? Talking to you
dirty in Chinese. That's what I'm doing.

19:09.787 --> 19:12.627
What? I've been studying
Mandarin in my off time.

19:13.357 --> 19:15.123
"Do you need to go
to the bathroom?"

19:15.125 --> 19:17.358
Please don't speak Chinese or
whatever during sex. Okay, I got it.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.995
Okay, no problem. Just, yeah. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be so picky.

19:20.997 --> 19:22.997
No, I... You look discouraged
and you're doing great.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
I told you I wasn't gonna be
any good at this.

19:25.001 --> 19:26.801
- Can we try something else?
- Yeah.

19:26.803 --> 19:29.403
Talk about...

19:29.405 --> 19:31.839
the first time you saw me.

19:31.841 --> 19:34.308
Okay?

19:34.310 --> 19:36.009
That's easy. Yeah, right.

19:36.011 --> 19:38.078
- I remember it like it was yesterday.
- Yeah?

19:38.080 --> 19:40.146
I was just getting done in the gym.
Yeah?

19:40.148 --> 19:42.548
You were leaving that pizza
place, remember? Yeah.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.250
Yeah, and you were
holding on to that box.

19:44.252 --> 19:46.218
Mm-hmm. And you walked out.

19:46.220 --> 19:48.220
Yeah?
Oh! You were in those jeans.

19:48.222 --> 19:51.591
- Oh, God! They looked so good from behind.
- Uh-huh?

19:51.593 --> 19:53.326
Oh. From behind... Yeah?

19:53.328 --> 19:54.860
Yeah? You looked like a dude!

19:54.862 --> 19:56.896
- What?
- Oh!

19:56.898 --> 19:58.530
Wha...

19:58.532 --> 20:02.501
What?

20:02.503 --> 20:03.935
Mm.

20:06.572 --> 20:08.406
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move at all!

20:08.408 --> 20:11.529
Don't move at all! Anything! Ah!
You're moving your arm!

20:14.513 --> 20:18.549
Fudge ripple ice cream! Ah!

20:20.854 --> 20:24.554
Oh, yeah!

20:29.059 --> 20:32.529
Oh. That was great.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.430
We gotta make that part of our program.
For sure.

20:34.432 --> 20:36.365
Really onto something.

20:47.410 --> 20:49.731
Amy. Don't forget
to hydrate, babe.

20:51.747 --> 20:54.081
We went verbal!

20:54.083 --> 20:56.317
The boys make the noise!

20:58.286 --> 21:01.656
What's up, brother?
Yes, I'm loving it. Rastaman!

21:01.658 --> 21:04.725
Digging it with the rolling bag.
Mixed messages.

21:04.727 --> 21:07.160
Come back over here.
I love you on <i> Glee.</i>

21:07.162 --> 21:09.563
How's it going?
Amy, what's happening?

21:09.565 --> 21:13.600
You got a new sign? Yeah, you know,
I'm working a couple ideas out.

21:13.602 --> 21:17.837
Yeah, I'm gonna visit my dad.
Oh. How is he?

21:17.839 --> 21:20.173
Eh, we put him in an
assisted living facility.

21:20.175 --> 21:22.441
I don't know
how nice it is actually.

21:22.443 --> 21:24.643
Hmm. I know exactly
how you feel.

21:24.645 --> 21:28.113
The car I take a shit in,
they towed it.

21:28.115 --> 21:29.447
Yeah. Sucks.

21:29.449 --> 21:31.483
Sorry, man. All right,
I'll see you later.

21:31.485 --> 21:33.084
I'll see you later.
I'll be here.

21:33.086 --> 21:35.319
Hey, I'm digging that
back camel toe.

21:35.321 --> 21:37.955
What a ridiculous statement.

21:37.957 --> 21:41.758
I mean, you're talking about the
most talented player on all levels.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.661
None of these bums
are the equal of Babe Ruth.

21:44.663 --> 21:47.430
- Norman, Babe Ruth was awful.
- Stop it.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.131
How can you negate facts?

21:49.133 --> 21:52.468
Just be nice to him. I am nice to him.
He's not nice to me.

21:52.470 --> 21:55.839
Babe Ruth was a superhero.
He was Superman!

21:55.841 --> 21:59.042
Easy to be a Superman when you never played
against a black guy your whole life.

21:59.044 --> 22:02.446
What does white-black
got to do with it?

22:02.448 --> 22:05.482
Every 12-year-old kid in the Dominican Republic
right now can probably beat Babe Ruth.

22:05.484 --> 22:07.318
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

22:07.320 --> 22:10.220
Before 1947, it's one big asterisk.
Blah!

22:10.222 --> 22:14.325
Can you just keep a low profile
for like two weeks, here?

22:14.327 --> 22:16.994
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't wanna
offend any of these people...

22:16.996 --> 22:19.731
who, uh, fucking each other with
Viagra day and night, God forbid.

22:19.733 --> 22:23.568
Can you just be nice and make friends?
After 7:00, after dinner,

22:23.570 --> 22:25.137
it turns into <i> Caligula</i>
around here.

22:25.139 --> 22:27.539
Trust me. Please, just...

22:27.541 --> 22:30.174
It's a madhouse, like the Playboy
Mansion, for Christ's sakes.

22:30.176 --> 22:32.710
This place? Yes.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.646
You got my Mets stuff?

22:36.648 --> 22:38.081
Yeah.

22:39.349 --> 22:41.850
Amy. I'll bring it by.

22:41.852 --> 22:43.185
Amy.

22:43.187 --> 22:46.054
Look at me.

22:46.056 --> 22:47.588
Amy.

22:47.590 --> 22:49.724
Kim made me throw
a lot of it away.

22:49.726 --> 22:52.860
- Kim made you? Your little sister?
- Yes. She's mean as a dog.

22:52.862 --> 22:55.663
- Jesus.
- I tried. I'm so sorry.

22:56.931 --> 22:58.998
What do I care?
It's all memorabilia anyway.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.701
I'm memorabilia at this point.

23:01.703 --> 23:03.302
Don't say that.

23:18.285 --> 23:20.120
Dr. Conners?

23:20.122 --> 23:22.122
Hi. Hi. Hey. Hi.

23:22.124 --> 23:24.357
Amy Townsend.
Hi. Aaron Conners.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.193
Great to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

23:26.195 --> 23:28.795
Thank you so much for letting me come in.
No worries.

23:28.797 --> 23:31.965
Um, so... How does this work?

23:31.967 --> 23:35.040
Oh, uh, today's really
just to go over schedules.

23:35.066 --> 23:35.901
Oh, okay.

23:35.903 --> 23:38.137
If that's cool.
Yeah, that's great.

23:38.139 --> 23:41.440
Uh, I have never, uh,
been interviewed for a magazine.

23:41.442 --> 23:42.941
Heya. Hey, LeBron.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.977
I don't mean to interrupt.
Did I leave my sunglasses here?

23:44.979 --> 23:47.579
I-I don't know. Did you?

23:47.581 --> 23:50.282
You know, I was sitting...
Oh, here they are. Phew!

23:50.284 --> 23:53.551
Did you just drive 40 minutes back
here to look for your sunglasses?

23:53.553 --> 23:56.454
Yeah, of course. You think I'm gonna
give Sunglass Hut another $30 for these?

23:56.456 --> 23:58.389
You crazy? Hey, how you doing?

23:58.391 --> 24:01.760
Hi! Wait, your watch costs
more than my apartment.

24:01.762 --> 24:04.629
Oh, this thing? Oh. Oh, that was a gift.
We watching <i> Downtown Abbey</i> later?

24:04.631 --> 24:06.897
Uh, if I get outta here on time.
Yeah, we could watch it.

24:06.899 --> 24:08.900
If not, let's do it tomorrow.
What?

24:08.902 --> 24:11.435
Listen, I'm watching it tonight, 'cause I'm
not gonna go to practice in the morning,

24:11.437 --> 24:13.738
and all the guys are talking
about it and I'm left out.

24:13.740 --> 24:15.639
Well, hey, do what you gotta do.
All right.

24:15.641 --> 24:17.273
Can you, uh, validate
my parking, please?

24:17.275 --> 24:19.576
I don't validate.
You should talk to Cheryl.

24:19.578 --> 24:21.144
Okay. All right, take care.
Nice meeting you.

24:21.146 --> 24:22.979
Bye, LeBron. Thanks, buddy.
Okay.

24:22.981 --> 24:25.649
Cheryl, can you
validate my parking, please?

24:25.651 --> 24:27.917
Tall. Yeah, I know, right?

24:27.919 --> 24:29.518
Do you know who that was?

24:30.620 --> 24:32.521
The basketball player.

24:32.523 --> 24:35.590
He's LeBron James. He's kind
of like <i>the</i> basketball player.

24:35.592 --> 24:38.427
Oh, yeah. I think I saw one of
his soda commercials. Yeah.

24:38.429 --> 24:40.429
You follow sports?

24:40.431 --> 24:42.998
Oh, my God. Sports?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.134
I love them.
Who are your favorite teams?

24:45.136 --> 24:46.768
The, uh...

24:46.770 --> 24:48.369
I like smaller teams,
like the...

24:48.371 --> 24:50.805
Not the big leagues.
I like the, like, uh,

24:50.807 --> 24:53.541
Long Island Mediums.

24:53.543 --> 24:56.611
The-The Acorn Pinecones.

24:56.613 --> 24:59.480
I haven't heard of them.
The Fire Island Penguins.

24:59.482 --> 25:02.484
I like the Cincinnati Thunder-Wizards.
You can stop.

25:02.486 --> 25:04.886
The Orlando...

25:04.888 --> 25:06.721
Blooms. You can stop.

25:06.723 --> 25:08.990
You... You don't follow sports.

25:08.992 --> 25:11.292
I... I'm sorry. I don't.

25:11.294 --> 25:13.194
I don't know anything about sports.
You know what?

25:13.196 --> 25:15.229
That's okay though. Don't be embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

25:15.231 --> 25:18.465
No, don't be embarrassed, because I didn't
really follow sports until I got this job.

25:18.467 --> 25:20.134
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

25:20.136 --> 25:23.303
Oh, my God. You have no idea
what a huge relief that is.

25:23.305 --> 25:26.674
I-I... I was assigned this.
This was not even my pitch.

25:26.676 --> 25:29.910
- Right. So you're doing the article on me?
- Mm-hmm.

25:29.912 --> 25:31.512
Awesome.

25:31.514 --> 25:34.548
I think they're kind of weird
and just-just... strange.

25:34.550 --> 25:37.685
Grown men wearing jerseys
with another man's name on it.

25:37.687 --> 25:39.687
Like, are you in jail?
Are you his bitch?

25:39.689 --> 25:41.255
Right. Kind of like that one?

25:47.095 --> 25:50.264
That's different,
'cause it's in a frame.

25:50.266 --> 25:52.266
I think sports brings
people together, you know.

25:52.268 --> 25:53.700
It kind of forms a community.

25:53.702 --> 25:56.236
That's what I'm saying.
Right. Yeah. Obviously.

25:56.238 --> 25:58.371
I'll tell you another thing
that's great about this job...

25:58.373 --> 26:00.606
is that I get to work with
athletes, which means that I, uh...

26:00.608 --> 26:01.908
I work with a lot of, um,

26:01.910 --> 26:03.242
Black people? Injuries...

26:03.244 --> 26:05.244
What did you just say?
Did you say, "black people"?

26:06.112 --> 26:07.613
No.

26:07.615 --> 26:09.381
Do you have a problem
with black people?

26:09.383 --> 26:12.250
No. I love black people.
I prefer black people.

26:12.252 --> 26:15.787
- Do you have black friends?
- Endless black friends.

26:15.789 --> 26:18.556
Can you show me pictures of your
black friends on your phone?

26:18.558 --> 26:22.127
You... You want to see pictures
on my phone of my black friends?

26:22.129 --> 26:24.195
Amy, you gotta have
a lot of them.

26:24.197 --> 26:26.932
I have so many. I'm just deciding which
one, 'cause there's, like, so many.

26:26.934 --> 26:28.800
Oh! Here we go.
Oh, great. Let's see.

26:28.802 --> 26:30.701
So, you're gonna be eating your words.
Oh, good.

26:30.703 --> 26:31.903
You ready? Yeah, I'm ready.

26:31.905 --> 26:33.571
Okay, get ready.

26:33.573 --> 26:35.272
Black friend!

26:35.274 --> 26:38.376
That is you and a white friend.

26:38.378 --> 26:41.245
And that is a black waiter
pouring your water.

26:41.247 --> 26:44.115
Let me find another one.
Oh. My phone died.

26:44.117 --> 26:47.043
Um, I'm gonna let you
get back to doctoring.

26:47.069 --> 26:48.084
Oh, thanks.

26:48.086 --> 26:49.886
- I'll talk to your...
- Cheryl.

26:49.888 --> 26:51.120
Cheryl. Yeah.

26:51.122 --> 26:54.556
About, um, when we can meet again.
Great.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.701
<i>No, we're not going
into the park.</i>

27:08.471 --> 27:10.505
<i>We've been in the park already.</i>

27:10.507 --> 27:11.906
Ooh.

27:11.908 --> 27:13.508
Sorry I'm late.

27:13.510 --> 27:15.643
No, it's okay.
It's a wonderful film.

27:15.645 --> 27:17.311
Daniel Radcliffe is in it.
Mm-hmm.

27:17.313 --> 27:19.347
Yeah.<i> Dog...</i> What is the movie?

27:19.349 --> 27:22.917
Radcliffe is a dog walker, but he's got
a chip on his shoulder, a real edge.

27:22.919 --> 27:24.485
Sundance loved it!

27:24.487 --> 27:27.255
<i>I need help with my dog.</i>

27:27.257 --> 27:30.291
<i>I can see that.</i>

27:30.293 --> 27:32.927
<i>I would love to be the one
to help you with your dog.</i>

27:32.929 --> 27:35.629
<i>What's your technique?</i>

27:35.631 --> 27:38.666
<i>Well, I put them
on a leash and walk them.</i>

27:38.668 --> 27:40.701
<i>You talk a big game.</i>

27:42.103 --> 27:45.473
<i>That's 'cause I walk a big dog.</i>

27:45.475 --> 27:47.508
<i>She's looks little,</i>

27:47.510 --> 27:50.144
Amy. <i>But she's not.</i>

27:50.146 --> 27:52.846
What's up?
Is that wine in a box?

27:52.848 --> 27:54.347
Mm-hmm.

27:54.349 --> 27:56.383
- I have red too.
- You have red too?

27:56.385 --> 27:58.184
What the fuck? Is this guy
ever gonna shut up?

27:58.186 --> 28:01.121
Mm, please watch the movie.

28:01.123 --> 28:03.356
Whoa. Stop. No, that's not right.
Don't do this to me.

28:03.358 --> 28:05.224
Why is he yelling?

28:05.226 --> 28:06.960
Listen, you always
do this to me.

28:06.962 --> 28:09.395
You show up to these places,
you put me in a situation.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.897
I'm a big guy. Everybody wants to
fight the big guy. Yeah, you are.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.300
Hey, uh, Mark Wahlberg,
shut your bitch up.

28:14.302 --> 28:17.303
Mark... Mark Wahlberg?
Are you gonna...

28:17.305 --> 28:20.840
Me? Who else looks like Mark Wahlberg?
Your girl?

28:20.842 --> 28:22.842
Mark Wahlberg's like
a hundred and fifty pounds.

28:22.844 --> 28:25.178
I'm 250, lean.

28:25.180 --> 28:27.580
I look like Mark Wahlberg
<i>ate</i> Mark Wahlberg!

28:27.582 --> 28:29.815
Your muscles aren't the fucking problem.
Do you even lift?

28:29.817 --> 28:31.350
It's your yapping girlfriend.

28:31.352 --> 28:32.551
Just say, "Fuck you."

28:32.553 --> 28:33.852
Yeah. Yes.

28:33.854 --> 28:35.987
I will fuck you! All right?
I will enter you!

28:35.989 --> 28:38.657
You're gonna...
You're gonna "enter" me?

28:38.659 --> 28:41.326
- Did you hear what he said?
- What are you talking about right now?

28:41.328 --> 28:42.895
I'm just trying
to intimidate him.

28:42.897 --> 28:44.563
You're just talking
about raping him.

28:44.565 --> 28:46.731
You're not about that life, champ.
I can see it.

28:46.733 --> 28:48.432
I am about that life!
No, you're not.

28:48.434 --> 28:51.102
You just like to flex your muscles.
I will get crazy up in here.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.870
You like movies? We'll make a movie.
Oh, God.

28:52.872 --> 28:54.538
We'll make
"Mama Say Knock You Out,"

28:54.540 --> 28:56.507
starring my fist
and your dick hole.

28:56.509 --> 28:59.069
Oh, shit! What the fuck
is wrong with this dude?

28:59.095 --> 29:00.010
He wants you.

29:00.012 --> 29:02.279
Babe, your threats, I'm telling
you, they're super gay.

29:02.281 --> 29:03.780
Too sexual? Yeah.

29:03.782 --> 29:06.582
This has to be the corniest,
muscled white dude...

29:06.584 --> 29:08.251
I've ever seen
in my fucking life.

29:09.453 --> 29:11.086
Okay, Koko B. Ware.
You know what?

29:11.088 --> 29:12.587
You're being an asshole,
all right?

29:12.589 --> 29:14.756
You know what I do with assholes?
I lick 'em. Okay.

29:14.758 --> 29:16.791
Uh, what the fuck?
He wants to fuck you.

29:16.793 --> 29:17.953
Okay?

29:25.702 --> 29:29.438
<i>My pooch has been hurt
more than enough.</i>

29:29.440 --> 29:33.609
<i>I will make sure no one ever
hurts your pooch again.</i>

29:33.611 --> 29:37.313
<i>I like when you're taking
control of your dogs.</i>

29:37.315 --> 29:39.715
<i>I thought you would.</i>

29:39.717 --> 29:42.050
Oh, my God.

29:43.820 --> 29:47.389
What'd I miss?
Amy, what did I miss?

29:47.391 --> 29:49.425
<i>I want to paddle real hard.</i>

29:49.427 --> 29:51.593
They pre-butter it.

29:51.595 --> 29:53.060
Who's Brody?

29:54.963 --> 29:56.330
What?

29:56.332 --> 29:58.765
Who's... Who's Oli? Who's Brody?

29:58.767 --> 30:01.068
Why you my have cell phone?

30:01.070 --> 30:02.736
Why are you smiling?

30:02.738 --> 30:06.773
I got a little high outside.
Like, barely at all high.

30:06.775 --> 30:08.841
Okay. While you were
outside getting high,

30:08.843 --> 30:11.009
I was putting your phone
on silent for the movie.

30:11.011 --> 30:13.779
When I did that, I noticed you
have all these guys in your phone.

30:13.781 --> 30:15.614
There's Brody. This guy is
listed as "Hot as Balls."

30:15.616 --> 30:17.649
Who the fuck is "Hot as Balls"?

30:17.651 --> 30:20.319
Stop smiling! I'm not smiling.
Those are guys from work.

30:20.321 --> 30:22.020
Oh.

30:22.022 --> 30:23.588
Can we just watch this movie?

30:23.590 --> 30:25.490
You know what? No, I can't.

30:25.492 --> 30:28.292
Because as I was turning off your phone,
I got a picture of somebody's dick.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.027
It was mine.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.863
You know, fuck you, Tone Loc.

30:31.865 --> 30:33.831
You want to take it to
the parking lot? Fine!

30:33.833 --> 30:36.834
You can't find me? I'll be
the closest one on Grindr.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.370
That's gay.

30:40.372 --> 30:44.007
Steven, please.
I am not in shape for this.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.175
Stop walking like the Hulk!
I can see that you're mad.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.343
You're being crazy. Am I?

30:48.345 --> 30:50.112
'Cause I think you owe me
an explanation for this.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.114
Do I have to worry about you
with other guys?

30:52.116 --> 30:54.817
I'm so high right now. Can we just
please talk about this tomorrow?

30:54.819 --> 30:56.819
I'm too fucked up.
Amy, you're always fucked up.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.854
Answer the question.

30:58.856 --> 31:01.490
Are you hooking up
with other guys?

31:01.492 --> 31:03.325
We never said we were exclusive.

31:03.327 --> 31:06.194
Fuck, Amy! "Exclusive"?
It's not high school.

31:06.196 --> 31:10.499
You know, every single guy I work
out with, every single guy...

31:10.501 --> 31:14.636
says that all you're gonna do is
mess with my emotions and hurt me.

31:14.638 --> 31:16.571
You guys talk about
that at the gym?

31:16.573 --> 31:19.215
Fuck, Amy. Do I have to worry
about you with other guys?

31:22.244 --> 31:24.545
Yes, I hook up with other guys.

31:24.547 --> 31:29.049
I don't go to the
movies with them.

31:29.051 --> 31:30.718
That's like our special thing.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.021
This is so fucking stupid.
You know what the sad part is?

31:35.023 --> 31:37.225
I was gonna ask you
to marry me.

31:39.359 --> 31:41.860
Really?

31:41.862 --> 31:44.363
I didn't even think
you liked me very much.

31:44.365 --> 31:46.365
Why are you making me
feel bad about this?

31:46.367 --> 31:49.836
You can sleep with other girls.
It's like every guy's dream.

31:49.838 --> 31:52.038
It's not this guy's dream.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.373
Yeah, this guy's got a dream,

31:54.375 --> 31:57.944
and it's us, making it.

31:57.946 --> 32:01.181
Getting married, moving out to the
countryside, having a family.

32:01.183 --> 32:03.516
Three boys and two more boys.

32:03.518 --> 32:06.051
Enough for a basketball team.
Why?

32:06.053 --> 32:08.888
And I'll develop a CrossFit
program and patent it.

32:08.890 --> 32:12.191
And I'll rule
the CrossFit world...

32:12.193 --> 32:14.561
with you by my side.

32:14.563 --> 32:17.463
You can be my CrossFit queen.

32:17.465 --> 32:19.098
That's my dream.

32:26.473 --> 32:27.806
Hey.

32:29.074 --> 32:30.474
Hey.

32:32.811 --> 32:36.079
Can I leave?

32:36.081 --> 32:38.148
Or, like, can you leave?

32:38.150 --> 32:43.620
I just like... I'm very high, and I just
kind of need this interaction to be over.

32:43.622 --> 32:45.655
You serious?

32:45.657 --> 32:48.224
Fuck you, Amy.
You are not nice.

32:52.964 --> 32:54.464
I'm totally nice.

32:57.769 --> 33:00.470
Maybe you should...

33:00.472 --> 33:03.140
consider changing your ways.

33:03.142 --> 33:05.609
My "ways"? Mm-hmm.

33:05.611 --> 33:07.745
You would love having a family.

33:07.747 --> 33:10.147
You sound like Steven. I wish
I could break up with you.

33:10.149 --> 33:11.982
Having a family is fun.

33:11.984 --> 33:13.586
That's fun? Yeah.

33:15.086 --> 33:17.020
They're having a boys' lunch.
Here?

33:17.022 --> 33:18.956
Hi! Hi, ladies.

33:18.958 --> 33:21.158
Um, I really like your hair.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.993
Is that choice,
or you, like did it?

33:22.995 --> 33:25.596
No, it's just my deal.
I'm bald. So... Oh.

33:25.598 --> 33:27.631
Cool. It's like...
You look like Bruce Willis.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.099
Like early Willis. Totally.

33:29.101 --> 33:30.533
Thanks.

33:30.535 --> 33:33.270
Um, You know what?
We will have two mimosas.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.171
Okay? Mm-mmm.

33:35.173 --> 33:37.674
No, you're right. Hold the orange juice.
No orange juice.

33:37.676 --> 33:40.376
It's sugar. So, champagne?

33:41.378 --> 33:42.812
Oh. Okay.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.547
No, no. No champagne for me.

33:44.549 --> 33:46.782
Uh, yeah, we'll have
two champagnes.

33:46.784 --> 33:50.620
Two champagnes. Thanks. Okay.
We'll see you in a bit.

33:50.622 --> 33:53.356
Oh, my God. He's, like,
dying to fuck me. Mm-hmm.

33:53.358 --> 33:56.859
Wait, why aren't you drinking?
Have a drink with me.

33:56.861 --> 33:58.894
Wait.

33:58.896 --> 34:00.128
No!

34:00.130 --> 34:02.965
You're pregnant? I'm pregnant!

34:02.967 --> 34:05.667
God!

34:05.669 --> 34:07.336
Tom's the father.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.770
Ew!

34:11.473 --> 34:13.708
God. They look like
they're on a speed date.

34:13.710 --> 34:15.476
Say, "Congratulations."

34:15.478 --> 34:17.978
We're telling Dad.

34:17.980 --> 34:21.341
I'll tell him at the new nursing home.
The one that's cheaper.

34:22.382 --> 34:24.752
It's not okay.
You're telling him.

34:24.754 --> 34:27.387
Kim, are you serious?

34:27.389 --> 34:29.322
Oh, my God. Congratulations.

34:29.324 --> 34:31.658
You're pregnant.

34:31.659 --> 34:34.060
Oh, my God.
Come here. Come here.

34:34.062 --> 34:35.694
Oh!

34:35.696 --> 34:38.764
My God. Oh, my God!

34:38.766 --> 34:40.732
I'm tingling right now.
I feel high.

34:40.734 --> 34:42.400
I feel high!

34:42.402 --> 34:44.770
- That's incredible.
- Thank you.

34:44.772 --> 34:47.239
I'm finally gonna be
a grandfather.

34:47.241 --> 34:49.542
You're already a grandfather.

34:49.543 --> 34:52.244
- But not yet.
- No. You were already a grandfather.

34:52.246 --> 34:54.079
Allister, Dad. What's that?

34:54.081 --> 34:55.181
Allister. What about him?

34:55.183 --> 34:56.549
That's your grandson.

34:56.551 --> 34:58.517
Allister?

35:00.119 --> 35:03.888
No, I mean, Allister's...
your stepchild...

35:03.890 --> 35:05.789
and my step-grandkid, I guess.

35:05.791 --> 35:08.216
But I'm talking about <i>your</i> kid.
Our bloodlines.

35:08.242 --> 35:09.226
That's... Yeah.

35:09.228 --> 35:12.630
I was the first person on my
block to own a television set.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.531
That's... That's really not
relevant right now, Norman.

35:14.533 --> 35:16.099
That's interest...
It's not relevant.

35:16.101 --> 35:17.600
Come on, that's more
like Tom's kid.

35:17.602 --> 35:20.236
It's Tom's kid,
who you help with.

35:20.238 --> 35:21.870
Dad, you love Allister.

35:21.872 --> 35:25.741
I like Allister. I care for him.
I fear for him.

35:25.743 --> 35:28.121
I know what happens to a kid
like that in the school yard.

35:28.147 --> 35:29.411
We had a kid like that. Stewie.

35:29.413 --> 35:32.081
We used to beat him mercilessly.

35:32.083 --> 35:34.817
Oh! Some of the beatings
I almost feel bad about.

35:34.819 --> 35:36.953
That's gonna happen to this kid.
He's perfectly...

35:36.955 --> 35:38.988
I'm trying to protect him,
teach him to be a man.

35:38.990 --> 35:41.290
I don't know what you're talking about.
You were the worst father ever.

35:41.292 --> 35:44.394
Come on. I wasn't a bad father.

35:44.396 --> 35:45.962
Mom did everything
when we were growing up.

35:45.964 --> 35:47.563
You wouldn't understand
'cause you weren't there.

35:47.565 --> 35:49.632
So now your mother's a saint?
Of course she's a saint.

35:49.634 --> 35:51.734
Of course. Because once you...
you die, everybody's a saint.

35:51.736 --> 35:53.435
Dad, just shut up.

35:53.437 --> 35:55.604
We were just talking about
this yesterday, right?

35:55.606 --> 35:56.805
- About Allister.
- Amy?

35:56.807 --> 35:58.239
No! He's... He's lying.

35:58.241 --> 36:00.575
Amy? Amy, come on.

36:00.577 --> 36:04.579
You said he's the kind of kid who drops his
pants to the floor when he pees in the urinal.

36:04.581 --> 36:06.648
No, I didn't say that. You said that!
That's funny to guys.

36:06.650 --> 36:09.083
I said he pees sitting down.

36:09.085 --> 36:10.918
- Like, it was a joke...
- That was funny.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.855
I cannot believe that you guys
are teaming up against me again.

36:13.857 --> 36:16.023
Oh, my... No. I am on your side.

36:16.025 --> 36:18.191
- I'm on your team.
- You're not on my team.

36:18.193 --> 36:20.761
Sorry if I'm excited more about my
grandkid than some step-grandkid.

36:20.763 --> 36:23.764
They're both your grandkid.
Goddamn it!

36:23.766 --> 36:25.866
What the... Kimberly, come...

36:27.935 --> 36:29.869
Is that your wife?

36:32.840 --> 36:36.375
What is this speech you have to
make for Doctors With Borders?

36:36.377 --> 36:40.846
"Without." Without Borders. It's
"Doctors Without Borders." Oh, right.

36:40.848 --> 36:44.217
Yeah, no, it's Doctors Without Borders.
It's really a good organization.

36:44.219 --> 36:47.720
Uh, basically, we go to places
with the most conflict,

36:47.722 --> 36:51.658
places with the biggest disasters
and we go in and help people.

36:51.660 --> 36:55.729
So, you help people by choice, and
that's, like, what you like? Yeah.

36:55.731 --> 36:57.330
It's great work.

36:57.332 --> 36:59.492
It's very rewarding,
helping these people.

36:59.518 --> 37:00.032
Wow!

37:00.034 --> 37:02.635
What's your story? Are you like a
Division I athlete or something?

37:02.637 --> 37:04.870
No! Me? No, no.

37:04.872 --> 37:10.008
I was on the Xbox that I was playing and then
I got really high and tripped on my bong.

37:10.010 --> 37:13.812
Are you high? Yeah.

37:13.814 --> 37:17.549
Wow. So high.

37:17.551 --> 37:19.818
I think I got your new article right here.
Here we go.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.586
All right.

37:21.588 --> 37:25.357
So, uh, this is our Sports Medicine
and Performance Center. Wow.

37:25.359 --> 37:28.360
This is where most of our athletes
come and, uh, do the rehabilitation.

37:28.362 --> 37:29.994
What does this do?

37:29.996 --> 37:32.230
Come on.

37:32.232 --> 37:36.901
So the HBM, uh, shows how your
muscles are working and moving,

37:36.903 --> 37:39.436
so your rehab's most effective.

37:39.438 --> 37:41.771
Um, it could help you
with your gait, your posture.

37:41.773 --> 37:44.241
- My gait?
- Mm-hmm.

37:44.243 --> 37:46.610
Okay. So, you, let's say, just
walk normal for a second.

37:46.612 --> 37:48.746
- That looks pretty good.
- Okay, okay.

37:48.748 --> 37:50.914
Just... Just walk naturally for
one second, please. Okay.

37:50.916 --> 37:52.916
That's it exa... Like this?

37:52.918 --> 37:55.637
I walk like Beyonc√©. People
always think I'm her.

37:55.663 --> 37:56.887
We share on Instagram.

37:56.889 --> 37:58.649
This is how you walk down the street?
Mm-hmm.

38:00.090 --> 38:01.858
No, this is how I walk.

38:01.860 --> 38:04.227
I think the screen's doing different
stuff than what I'm doing.

38:04.229 --> 38:06.730
What we can do with this,
is we could show how you can,

38:06.732 --> 38:10.366
um, fix your posture
and your gait.

38:10.368 --> 38:12.802
I really wouldn't do
a Hitler march.

38:12.804 --> 38:16.438
Just walk the way you walk,
uh, down the street.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.306
Is that... Is that... Like this?

38:22.744 --> 38:24.979
All right. Sorry. I'm listening.
Okay? We good?

38:24.981 --> 38:26.780
Yeah, I'm listening. You good?
All right. Thank you.

38:26.782 --> 38:29.983
Wait, who is this? Ready? Watch the screen.
Who is this? - Okay.

38:33.989 --> 38:36.558
Who? Kevin Spacey at the
end of <i> Usual Suspects.</i>

38:36.560 --> 38:39.294
I didn't see that movie.
Oh. He's Keyser S√∂ze.

38:39.296 --> 38:41.429
That's not important.
It's not a spoiler. Oh.

38:41.431 --> 38:44.232
So why don't you pick up the
speed a little bit? That's good.

38:44.234 --> 38:47.101
That's good. Get a nice
jog going there. Okay.

38:47.103 --> 38:48.803
That's good.

38:48.805 --> 38:50.771
You can speed up
a bit faster, if you want.

38:50.773 --> 38:54.675
Ah. There you go. See how that's
working out? That's great.

38:54.677 --> 38:56.777
See how your legs are lighting up green?
That's great.

38:56.779 --> 38:58.645
You can go
a little faster actually.

38:58.647 --> 39:01.081
Yeah, so don't lean forward
like that when you run.

39:01.083 --> 39:03.450
You wanna lean back a little bit.
See how that's lighting up green?

39:03.452 --> 39:05.492
There you go.
See, that's real nice.

39:06.687 --> 39:09.021
See how you're...
you're landing on your heel.

39:09.023 --> 39:11.990
You're stepping too far back. So you
wanna land on the ball of your foot.

39:11.992 --> 39:14.994
There you go.
See, that's real nice.

39:14.996 --> 39:18.197
Okay. How do you stop? Can you,
uh, make sure this thing stops?

39:20.168 --> 39:21.967
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

39:21.969 --> 39:23.468
You all right? Uh-huh.

39:23.470 --> 39:25.471
You're hyperventilating. Here.
Yeah. Can you get this off?

39:25.473 --> 39:27.539
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You're fine. Okay. Okay.

39:27.541 --> 39:29.641
- Look at me.
- Deep breath in.

39:29.643 --> 39:31.810
Blow it out like you're
blowing out a birthday candle.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.481
That's good, that's good.
Slow it down. Slow it down.

39:36.483 --> 39:39.484
You're just hyperventilating.
You're all right.

39:39.486 --> 39:42.688
You're okay.
Just take your time.

39:42.690 --> 39:45.123
You all right?

39:45.125 --> 39:47.692
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, okay.

39:47.694 --> 39:49.961
- I haven't eaten much today.
- Oh, okay.

39:49.963 --> 39:52.977
I had like... Basically,
like, Lay's potato chips.

39:53.003 --> 39:53.731
Oh.

39:53.733 --> 39:57.368
Like... Stopped in Starbucks,
had, like one red velvet...

39:57.370 --> 40:00.372
like, yogurt.

40:00.374 --> 40:04.209
And, like, two scones
and they were, like super small.

40:04.211 --> 40:07.479
And then just some Chipotle, but that
stuff, you know, like, runs through you.

40:07.481 --> 40:09.647
So you had breakfast,
lunch and a snack?

40:09.649 --> 40:11.315
Yeah, that's it. Okay.

40:11.317 --> 40:13.484
Well, let's go get some food.
Yeah.

40:13.486 --> 40:15.619
Yeah? Let's do that. Yeah.

40:27.333 --> 40:30.869
Um, my dad, um,

40:30.871 --> 40:33.071
is a rheumatologist,

40:33.073 --> 40:35.239
and my mom is
a college professor.

40:35.241 --> 40:37.375
They're great. They put a
lot of pressure on me.

40:37.377 --> 40:39.343
I was their only child, so...

40:39.345 --> 40:41.545
Or maybe they didn't put
a lot of pressure on me.

40:41.547 --> 40:44.682
I just put the pressure on myself 'cause
they did so much great stuff, but...

40:44.684 --> 40:46.717
No, they put pressure on me.
Let's not put...

40:46.719 --> 40:48.920
Can we not put this in the article?
Is that all right?

40:48.922 --> 40:51.956
This doesn't need to be in the article.
I don't know why I'm saying any of it.

40:51.958 --> 40:54.191
They're great. They're great.
They're great.

40:54.193 --> 40:55.633
Aaron's parents are great.
They sound great.

40:55.659 --> 40:56.561
"Aaron's parents are great."

40:56.563 --> 40:59.564
I won't put any of that in
the article, if you don't want.

40:59.566 --> 41:01.033
Is that all right? Yeah.

41:01.035 --> 41:03.035
- Just off the record.
- Okay.

41:03.037 --> 41:06.706
Um, just so you know, if you want me to,
uh, keep something out of the article,

41:06.708 --> 41:09.475
if you want it to be off the record,
you have to tell me <i> before.</i>

41:09.477 --> 41:12.445
Oh, really? Yeah. Uh,
this can be retroactive.

41:12.447 --> 41:15.147
I won't put your parents in
the article, but... Okay.

41:15.149 --> 41:19.718
Thanks.
This article is gonna be killer.

41:19.720 --> 41:23.488
Yeah, it's gonna be a bummer.

41:23.490 --> 41:25.724
Um... Hey, you know,
I read some of your stuff.

41:25.726 --> 41:27.292
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

41:27.294 --> 41:29.394
They were really good. No.

41:29.396 --> 41:32.331
When I started reading, it was one
thing, and I was like, "I don't know."

41:32.333 --> 41:34.599
Then I started reading it
and I thought it was... I was...

41:34.601 --> 41:37.269
"Oh, this is actually really funny
and smart." It's satirical.

41:37.271 --> 41:40.572
- Thank you.
- It was... It was good.

41:40.574 --> 41:43.175
I have other stuff that
I've written for other places.

41:43.177 --> 41:45.577
That's the kind of stuff
they want at this magazine.

41:45.579 --> 41:48.079
Can I read some of it?

41:48.081 --> 41:51.149
Uh, yeah, you can read...
you can read some of my stuff.

41:52.584 --> 41:54.852
- Do you wanna go get a drink?
- Yeah.

41:54.854 --> 41:56.186
Yeah? Okay.

42:00.158 --> 42:01.992
Can I get the check, please?
They... He understood.

42:01.994 --> 42:04.461
Don't do it... Don't do
the symbol and yell.

42:04.463 --> 42:06.297
Just... You do one or the other.

42:06.299 --> 42:07.998
What do you mean?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.433
You can mouth the word "check"
really loud and not make noise.

42:10.435 --> 42:12.101
And that's, like,
kind of the best.

42:12.103 --> 42:14.064
Well, what do I do? Watch.

42:14.538 --> 42:16.939
Check.

42:16.941 --> 42:18.942
Okay, let me try. Okay.

42:18.944 --> 42:21.311
- Check!
- No! No.

42:21.313 --> 42:22.945
No.

42:22.947 --> 42:24.714
Am I not doing that right? No!

42:24.716 --> 42:26.549
Check! Oh, my God!

42:26.551 --> 42:28.951
Could we get the bill, please?
We'd like to pay for the food!

42:37.963 --> 42:41.030
Okay, first kiss. This girl
named Jennifer Jennifer.

42:41.032 --> 42:42.699
Her name was Jennifer Jennifer?

42:42.701 --> 42:45.068
Her name was Jennifer Jennifer,
and she was very cute.

42:45.070 --> 42:47.236
It was... It was a Halloween
party, seventh grade.

42:47.238 --> 42:50.139
She was shorter than me. She had
to stand up on a stone to kiss me.

42:50.141 --> 42:52.474
It was... It was like
a Norman Rockwell painting.

42:52.476 --> 42:54.743
It was very cute. Oh! And
you see these teeth? Yeah.

42:54.745 --> 42:57.212
Oh. Look at these teeth.

42:57.214 --> 42:59.147
What's wrong? They're fake.
They're porcelain.

42:59.149 --> 43:02.484
Ron Gardner, seventh grade.

43:02.486 --> 43:06.087
I got brand-new Air Jordans.
He wanted them. Yeah?

43:06.089 --> 43:09.858
He punched me in the face and knocked
out my teeth and stole my shoes.

43:09.860 --> 43:11.759
No! You're getting a
lot of info for me.

43:11.761 --> 43:13.728
Ron Gardner! This is all
of the record, by the way.

43:13.730 --> 43:15.563
All off the record. Oh, yeah,
off the record. Totally.

43:15.565 --> 43:18.065
Hey, today was really fun.
Yeah, it was great.

43:18.067 --> 43:19.700
I was a little nervous about it.
Yeah.

43:19.702 --> 43:22.369
But no, this was a lot of fun.
No, this was great.

43:22.371 --> 43:25.873
Um, if you wanna, like, maybe
come by tomorrow or... You coming?

43:25.875 --> 43:27.741
Oh, you going downtown? Mm-hmm.

43:27.743 --> 43:30.043
Sweet. Uh, and...

43:30.045 --> 43:33.047
Hi. Sorry.

43:33.049 --> 43:36.884
Uh, two stops.
Uh, just one stop.

43:36.886 --> 43:39.953
You wanna give him
your address?

43:39.955 --> 43:42.021
Sp... Spring and Washington.

43:54.569 --> 43:57.604
Great. So, this
is where I live.

43:57.606 --> 43:59.973
Uh, it's pretty sweet.

43:59.975 --> 44:03.043
Um, do you want a drink or anything?
No, thanks.

44:03.045 --> 44:07.614
No? All right.
Um, this is the kitchen.

44:07.616 --> 44:11.984
Um, it's a pretty sweet place.
I've been here for about a year.

44:11.986 --> 44:16.288
Uh, you know what? Let's get
some tunes on in this place.

44:16.290 --> 44:20.393
Holy shit. Hi. Hi.

44:28.736 --> 44:31.839
So we're gonna do this now?
We are gonna do this now.

44:31.841 --> 44:33.507
Okay, that's...

44:33.509 --> 44:35.942
Is that okay?
That's cool, yeah.

44:35.944 --> 44:38.845
Whoa! Ooh. All right.

44:41.114 --> 44:43.182
Do you own this place?
Are you renting it?

44:43.184 --> 44:45.450
I, uh... I own it.
Oh, cool. That's really nice.

44:45.452 --> 44:47.051
Yeah, yeah.

44:50.322 --> 44:52.289
You wanna g-go...

44:52.291 --> 44:54.091
Oh, shit. Yeah.

44:54.093 --> 44:56.693
Oh, we're doing this, like, right now?
We are doing this right now.

44:56.695 --> 44:59.128
Wow, we are off to the races.
It's happening.

44:59.130 --> 45:02.332
Oh, okay. All right.
That's nice.

45:02.334 --> 45:07.771
Oh! Oh, man. Oh, God!

45:07.773 --> 45:11.541
Oh, my God! Wow, good for you.
Yeah, oh, thank you.

45:11.543 --> 45:13.210
This is... I didn't
see this for you.

45:13.212 --> 45:14.644
Yeah? Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.

45:14.646 --> 45:16.545
Mm! Mm.

45:19.183 --> 45:20.715
Oh.

45:24.187 --> 45:27.055
Okay. I'm, uh...
I'm gonna head out.

45:27.057 --> 45:28.356
Oh, no. No.

45:28.358 --> 45:30.225
Hey. Thank you. Oh.

45:30.227 --> 45:32.193
That's... Yeah, why don't
you stay over?

45:32.195 --> 45:34.828
Uh, yes, no.
I'm not gonna stay here.

45:34.830 --> 45:37.198
I just... I...
You have an early day, I bet.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.833
Oh, no, it's fine. Mmm.

45:52.747 --> 45:55.149
You comfortable?
No. No, I'm not.

45:55.151 --> 45:57.217
Okay. This is... I don't
really like to spoon.

45:57.219 --> 46:00.754
Oh. Okay. Yeah, just sorry.

46:00.756 --> 46:04.523
C-Can we, uh... If I stay here, can we
just sleep in a realistic position?

46:04.525 --> 46:06.726
Because it just... Sure, yeah.

46:06.728 --> 46:09.929
I'm a light sleeper,
and I, like... I-I...

46:09.931 --> 46:13.199
If I feel you move or, like, sweat
or breathe, I'll, like, wake up,

46:13.201 --> 46:16.335
and I'll just, like, lay here
resenting you all night. Okay.

46:16.337 --> 46:19.672
Can we... Actually, could we put
this pillow in between us?

46:19.674 --> 46:21.774
That'll be good, if we put this...
Put the pillow between us?

46:21.776 --> 46:24.577
Yeah, that's not, like, your
main pillow that you use, is it?

46:24.579 --> 46:26.078
No. Okay, cool.

46:26.080 --> 46:28.280
Yeah, let's just...
Let's kind of get that in there.

46:28.282 --> 46:30.583
Thank you. Okay.

46:30.585 --> 46:31.917
Yeah.

46:35.521 --> 46:38.891
I'm sorry I'm nitpicking, but, like, you're
breathing on me pretty hard right now.

46:38.893 --> 46:41.727
Yeah, it's like a strong wind. Oh, okay.
What do you need me to do?

46:41.729 --> 46:45.231
Breathe up towards the sky and
not, like, at me. Yeah. Okay.

46:45.233 --> 46:48.602
Sorry, it's just... It's a lot.
Yeah, you got it. You got it.

46:48.604 --> 46:51.304
Like this? Are you just...
Are you feeling better?

46:51.306 --> 46:53.130
Is this more comfortable?
Let me see. Do it.

46:53.156 --> 46:54.453
I'll tell you if I can feel it.

46:56.110 --> 47:00.447
I'm still getting, like, a
little bit of a wind. Oh, Jesus.

47:00.449 --> 47:03.049
Do you want me to go home? I can
still sleep at home. No, no.

47:03.051 --> 47:05.517
This is... This is so worth it.

47:08.288 --> 47:11.456
Nikki, just hurry up
and get here.

47:11.458 --> 47:14.293
When you're writing an article, do
you always use a tape recorder?

47:14.295 --> 47:15.794
No.

47:15.796 --> 47:17.930
Um, wh-when you're
writing an article,

47:17.932 --> 47:20.499
what are the 10 biggest
mistakes you could make?

47:20.501 --> 47:24.570
Um, plagiarizing, getting
drunk, fucking someone.

47:24.572 --> 47:27.139
Hey. Have you ever seen
any kind of article...

47:27.141 --> 47:30.776
about a fetish where guys like
to masturbate to hockey fights?

47:30.778 --> 47:32.344
That's not a thing.
Not a thing.

47:32.346 --> 47:34.913
Then why'd it work for me?

47:34.915 --> 47:37.850
- We're in the middle of something, so...
- Yeah. Seriously, right?

47:41.188 --> 47:44.190
Okay. So, that actually brings me to
an interesting line of questioning.

47:44.192 --> 47:46.792
You know what?
Uh, they're gonna want you...

47:46.794 --> 47:48.961
to just do a bunch of Web stuff
because you're younger.

47:48.963 --> 47:51.363
Everyone has, like, a boner for young
people and the Internet, okay?

47:51.365 --> 47:53.365
They think you have, like,
the key to it. Amy!

47:53.367 --> 47:55.250
That's why we'll do anything
we can to help you here.

47:55.276 --> 47:56.435
Right, but when
you're writing...

47:56.437 --> 47:58.136
I'm sorry. Just talk
to me about it later.

47:58.138 --> 48:01.340
Just write them all down.
I'll be helpful later.

48:01.342 --> 48:02.674
Okay.

48:02.676 --> 48:05.309
I like you, Amy.
I do, you know.

48:05.311 --> 48:07.478
You're clever,
but you're not too brainy.

48:07.480 --> 48:10.447
You're pretty-ish and you're not gorgeous.
You're approachable.

48:10.449 --> 48:12.149
Thank you. Yeah.

48:12.151 --> 48:14.351
I want this promotion for
you, Amy, you know? Yeah.

48:14.353 --> 48:16.119
I want you to help me
to help you.

48:16.121 --> 48:17.988
I need to go up there,
to the men upstairs.

48:17.990 --> 48:20.457
I need you to provide me
with the <i> ammo...</i> Yeah.

48:20.459 --> 48:23.026
To get them to know that you
can handle their workload.

48:23.028 --> 48:25.062
Can you handle their load, Amy?

48:25.064 --> 48:27.730
I can handle all their loads.
That's it.

48:30.634 --> 48:32.568
- Nikki.
- Hey.

48:32.570 --> 48:34.836
Where have you been? Oh. Sorry.
I was getting a smoothie.

48:34.838 --> 48:37.239
Can you just... Please, sit?

48:37.241 --> 48:39.674
I slept at the doctor's
place last night.

48:39.676 --> 48:41.910
Oh my God, 'cause you were,
like, blackout drunk? No.

48:41.912 --> 48:44.412
That's the thing.
I-I was dead sober.

48:44.414 --> 48:47.214
I had, like, two drinks.
Three, max.

48:47.216 --> 48:49.650
Four, now that I'm tallying.
But it was like... I was sober.

48:49.652 --> 48:52.185
Okay, so you... so you barely drank?
Barely.

48:52.187 --> 48:54.021
'Cause you're on antibiotics
or something? No.

48:54.023 --> 48:55.555
I spent the night on purpose.

48:55.557 --> 48:57.590
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand.

48:57.592 --> 49:01.394
When you think about the sex,
are you just kinda like...

49:01.396 --> 49:03.396
No. I'm like...

49:06.934 --> 49:09.769
So, you're like...

49:09.771 --> 49:11.670
No, that's not what I'm doing.

49:11.672 --> 49:13.873
You're...

49:13.875 --> 49:15.507
Oh, my God! He's calling.

49:15.509 --> 49:17.709
Why would he call?
You guys just had sex.

49:17.711 --> 49:19.211
It's probably a mistake.
It's a mistake. Yeah.

49:19.213 --> 49:20.912
He's... He's butt-dialing you.
Hello.

49:20.914 --> 49:22.613
<i>Oh. Hey, there.
It's... It's Aaron.</i>

49:22.615 --> 49:24.449
Oh. This is Amy.

49:24.451 --> 49:26.083
I think you butt-dialed me.

49:26.085 --> 49:28.018
No. No, I... I dialed
you with my fingers.

49:28.020 --> 49:30.588
What's she saying?
What did she say? Shh!

49:30.590 --> 49:32.256
- He called me on purpose.
- Hang up.

49:32.258 --> 49:34.191
He's obviously, like, sick
or something, so he's... No.

49:34.193 --> 49:34.932
Um, yeah, what's up?

49:34.958 --> 49:37.261
I was calling to say I had a
really good time last night.

49:37.263 --> 49:39.363
I was wondering if you wanted
to, um, hang out again.

49:40.565 --> 49:42.934
Will you say that again, please?

49:42.936 --> 49:46.037
<i>I was wondering
if I could see you again.</i>

49:46.039 --> 49:48.540
You know what? I'm gonna call
the police because he's a...

49:48.542 --> 49:50.308
Hold on, hold on.

49:50.310 --> 49:53.044
Uh, yeah, I'll just talk to you
about it tomorrow at the interview.

49:53.046 --> 49:54.980
<i>Okay?</i> Oh, yes!

49:54.982 --> 49:56.815
Yes. She said yes! She said yes!
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

49:56.817 --> 49:58.716
All right. All right,
I'll talk to you then.

49:58.718 --> 50:00.652
Whoa, man! Huh?

50:00.654 --> 50:02.286
That... That's pretty cool, man.

50:02.288 --> 50:04.288
I didn't get to hear
the whole conversation though.

50:04.290 --> 50:06.991
We're gonna talk... We're gonna talk about
it when we see each other tomorrow.

50:06.993 --> 50:08.792
Oh, that's great, man.
Yeah, she's got a sexy voice.

50:08.794 --> 50:10.260
That's great.

50:10.262 --> 50:13.097
Did you guys make love?

50:13.099 --> 50:14.798
Yeah. Oh, ho, ho!

50:14.800 --> 50:16.099
Whoo! Shh!

50:16.101 --> 50:17.600
My boy got intimate. Yes.

50:17.602 --> 50:19.002
Sexual intercourse! Whoo!

50:19.004 --> 50:21.104
Do you want to just announce
it to everybody and...

50:21.106 --> 50:25.509
My boy got a girlfriend. Like,
man, it's been forever. Yeah.

50:25.511 --> 50:27.444
I'm not gonna lie. It's been a while.
Yeah, yeah.

50:27.446 --> 50:29.747
It's been like six years
since Sheila and... Yeah.

50:29.749 --> 50:31.782
That only lasted like five weeks.
Yep.

50:31.784 --> 50:32.562
There was Debbie.

50:32.588 --> 50:34.851
Debbie didn't even tell
you where she lived.

50:34.853 --> 50:37.354
Yeah, she thought I was a psycho.
She kept calling me "Dexter."

50:37.356 --> 50:39.489
What I'm saying is,
you got to go for it.

50:39.491 --> 50:41.959
Focus if you want to take it
to the next level. Right.

50:41.961 --> 50:44.795
You have to. You gotta give it everything
you own if you want this one, man.

50:44.797 --> 50:47.531
It's like, when I lost
the championship in 2011,

50:47.533 --> 50:49.367
I worked on my game
twice as hard, Yeah.

50:49.369 --> 50:51.168
Worked on my post-up game,

50:51.170 --> 50:53.938
and we wound up winning the
championship, twice. Yeah.

50:53.940 --> 50:55.940
Yeah. I don't feel like
that applies to me.

50:55.942 --> 50:58.375
But I-I appreciate
the... the thought.

50:58.377 --> 51:00.511
Aaron, you have to take a risk.
Yeah, no, you're right.

51:00.513 --> 51:03.113
You have to. It's like, when I
decided to go back to Cleveland,

51:03.115 --> 51:05.816
I wasn't totally sure they was
gonna welcome me back, man.

51:05.818 --> 51:09.386
But they did. They welcomed me back
with open arms and an open heart.

51:09.388 --> 51:13.323
Yeah, they did. Again, I feel
that applies more to you.

51:13.325 --> 51:15.825
Um, like, I don't even
live in Cleveland.

51:15.827 --> 51:18.962
But, again, I appreciate the thought.
Cleveland, Ohio?

51:18.964 --> 51:21.197
Talking about the home of
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

51:21.199 --> 51:23.199
Maybe go to Canton to
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

51:23.201 --> 51:24.734
You know Superman
was created in Cleveland?

51:24.736 --> 51:26.535
Yeah, no, I know Superman
was created in Cleveland.

51:26.537 --> 51:28.169
You've told me that
a number of times.

51:28.171 --> 51:30.138
You ever seen a Cuyahoga sunset?
No.

51:30.140 --> 51:32.206
Do you know Cleveland's great
for the whole family? Yes. Yes.

51:32.208 --> 51:34.374
Yes, I do. You tell
me that all the time.

51:34.376 --> 51:36.477
You randomly just text me that.
What's wrong with that?

51:36.479 --> 51:39.079
- Which is weird. It's weird.
- I got free texting.

51:39.081 --> 51:40.880
Why are trying to always
sell me on Cleveland?

51:40.882 --> 51:43.350
When are you gonna
come to Cleveland?

51:43.352 --> 51:46.052
I'll-I'll... I'll come when
I have the, uh... the time.

51:46.054 --> 51:48.655
I don't have the time right now.
I'll come when I have the time.

51:48.657 --> 51:50.857
- I've just been really busy.
- You visit me in Miami all the time.

51:50.859 --> 51:53.593
Yeah, but that's Miami. I mean...

51:53.595 --> 51:55.595
What's the difference between
Miami and Cleveland?

51:55.621 --> 51:56.621
It's... It's the same.

51:58.732 --> 52:01.234
- You're right. It's the same.
- Exactly.

52:03.103 --> 52:06.106
Okay, so you... You had the salmon.
That's about $14.

52:06.108 --> 52:07.874
What are you doing, man?
You had two Cokes.

52:07.876 --> 52:10.276
Dude, are you trying to
split the bill? Look.

52:10.278 --> 52:12.345
Look, I... Look, I told you those
refills weren't free. Yeah.

52:12.347 --> 52:14.013
No, no, no, no, no. We're
not splitting the bill.

52:14.015 --> 52:15.781
Pick up the check.

52:15.783 --> 52:18.251
Why do I have to pick up the check?
'Cause you're LeBron James.

52:18.253 --> 52:21.787
Listen, don't look at me no differently
now just because I got a little money.

52:21.789 --> 52:23.622
Look, I don't know
how long this could last.

52:23.624 --> 52:25.424
Anything can happen. Right.

52:25.426 --> 52:27.292
I'm not about to end up
like MC Hammer. Yeah.

52:27.294 --> 52:29.027
Listen, you owe $32.43.

52:29.029 --> 52:31.063
You know what? I'm...

52:31.065 --> 52:33.698
I'll pay it, but you gotta pick
up a check every once in a while.

52:33.700 --> 52:35.466
No, no, no. Don't pay
the whole thing.

52:35.468 --> 52:38.269
Just pay your part.
It's better for our friendship.

52:38.271 --> 52:40.371
- Equals forever.
- All right. All right, fine.

52:40.373 --> 52:42.207
All right. I'll put
my credit card in.

52:42.209 --> 52:44.242
Put a... Put a credit card in.
We'll split it.

52:44.244 --> 52:46.410
Okay. That's what...
That's what I'm talking...

52:46.412 --> 52:47.979
Fuck you.

52:47.981 --> 52:49.213
I think... Fuck you.

52:49.215 --> 52:50.447
I think I left my wallet.
Fuck you.

52:50.449 --> 52:52.250
It's in the car. Fuck you.

53:22.179 --> 53:25.347
So that was disgusting. Yeah.

53:25.349 --> 53:27.349
Why Billy Joel?

53:27.351 --> 53:31.087
Why "Uptown Girl"?
I love that song.

53:31.089 --> 53:33.823
That's, like, probably
the worst Billy Joel song.

53:33.825 --> 53:35.592
I'm pretty sure Billy
Joel hates that song.

53:35.594 --> 53:37.160
Oh, he shouldn't. It's great.

53:38.095 --> 53:39.695
Okay.

53:39.697 --> 53:41.831
So, uh, off the record.

53:44.167 --> 53:46.968
Do you wanna maybe
go grab some dinner?

53:46.970 --> 53:50.439
Um, actually, Aaron,
I think you're so great,

53:50.441 --> 53:53.175
and, uh... but I'm a writer.

53:53.177 --> 53:55.144
I'm <i> your</i> writer.
You're my subject.

53:55.146 --> 53:59.716
And, uh, from now on, we need
to just keep it professional.

53:59.718 --> 54:00.883
Okay. You know?

54:00.885 --> 54:02.684
Yeah. Okay.

54:02.686 --> 54:05.954
I think we really like each other
and we should start dating.

54:05.956 --> 54:09.223
N... No, I'm-I'm saying...

54:09.225 --> 54:11.659
I'm confused. I-I... Am I not
communicating this right?

54:11.661 --> 54:12.188
Like, I-I...

54:12.214 --> 54:14.294
No, I hear you. I'm
just saying I disagree.

54:14.296 --> 54:16.229
- Do you like me?
- Yeah.

54:16.231 --> 54:17.798
Yeah, see, I really like you.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.366
So we should be a couple.

54:19.368 --> 54:21.634
No! No!

54:21.636 --> 54:23.570
I-I have pla... plans.

54:23.572 --> 54:26.072
- What are your plans?
- Dentist.

54:26.074 --> 54:28.240
Is that true? No.

54:28.242 --> 54:31.811
Then let's go out.

54:31.813 --> 54:33.712
I'm sorry. My dad's
place is calling.

54:34.647 --> 54:36.582
Hello?

54:37.850 --> 54:39.884
Well, why didn't
someone help him?

54:39.886 --> 54:40.406
What is it?

54:40.432 --> 54:42.487
Um, my dad fell. He
lives in assisted living.

54:42.489 --> 54:44.188
I need to change.
Okay, I'm on my way.

54:44.190 --> 54:47.057
What hospital is he at?
Uh, I don't know.

54:52.430 --> 54:54.031
Sit still, Gordon.

54:54.033 --> 54:55.399
- Dad!
- Hey, baby.

54:55.401 --> 54:57.067
What happened? Nothing.

54:57.069 --> 54:58.768
He's supposed to ring
his call button...

54:58.770 --> 55:00.537
if he wants to get out
of his chair.

55:00.539 --> 55:02.705
- He has fallen.
- Where's the doctor?

55:02.707 --> 55:05.942
They are ignoring my pages.
If I wanted, I could treat him.

55:05.944 --> 55:07.877
I was a doctor in my country.

55:07.879 --> 55:11.113
Yeah, I'll let you know if the wound
gets invaded by evil spirits.

55:11.115 --> 55:12.582
Are you in pain, Dad? No.

55:12.584 --> 55:14.250
Can I take a look at it, please?

55:14.252 --> 55:16.585
Oh, God, Dad!

55:16.587 --> 55:19.855
No, it looks a lot worse
than it actually is.

55:19.857 --> 55:22.090
- Who's this Moondoggie?
- Hi. I'm Dr. Conners.

55:22.092 --> 55:23.926
Your daughter and I just
officially started dating.

55:23.928 --> 55:26.261
No. Not officially. Not at all.

55:26.263 --> 55:28.429
Welcome to a very large club.

55:28.431 --> 55:30.465
You are gonna be
getting stitches today.

55:30.467 --> 55:33.401
- Not a chance, buster.
- Dad, let him do it.

55:33.403 --> 55:35.069
No, what's the point?
Just leave it.

55:35.071 --> 55:37.038
Why do I have to look like
Kate Middleton for? Yeah.

55:37.040 --> 55:38.439
I don't give consent.
Here we go.

55:38.441 --> 55:40.040
No consent! Shut up, Dad.

55:40.042 --> 55:41.884
See, I need you to stop moving.

55:46.615 --> 55:49.316
- What is he humming?
- Uh, Billy Joel.

55:49.318 --> 55:51.451
"Uptown Girl." That's the
only thing that saves you.

55:51.453 --> 55:55.322
I like Billy Joel. I saw him in Nassau
Coliseum, Nylon... Curtain Tour.

55:55.324 --> 55:57.123
Oh, Nylon Curtain Tour?
That's awesome.

55:57.125 --> 55:59.125
You know, I saw him
with Elton John in Shea Stadium.

55:59.127 --> 56:00.961
It was great.
Of course you did.

56:00.963 --> 56:02.996
Nothing better than
down-to-earth,

56:02.998 --> 56:06.500
blue collar Billy Joel with Elton
John, the queen of England.

56:06.502 --> 56:09.936
Hey, uh, Amy tells me that you're
a, uh, Mets fan. Is that right?

56:09.938 --> 56:12.069
I'm a supporter of the
New York Metropolitans.

56:12.095 --> 56:12.839
That is correct.

56:12.841 --> 56:14.907
What about it? Would you
like to hear some trivia?

56:14.909 --> 56:18.978
Oh, distracting me like I'm a young girl
getting her ears pierced? Go ahead.

56:18.980 --> 56:22.648
Can you name nine major league teams
that don't end with the letter "S."

56:22.650 --> 56:24.417
Child's play.

56:24.419 --> 56:26.419
The Jazz, Utah Jazz.

56:26.421 --> 56:28.421
You got the Miami Heat.
You got the White Sox.

56:28.423 --> 56:31.792
What's up? I shouldn't
be telling you this,

56:31.794 --> 56:34.027
but I think he's hoarding
his pain medication.

56:34.029 --> 56:36.430
No, I got it.
Ease up, Martha Stewart.

56:36.432 --> 56:39.599
Hey! Water aerobics.
You coming?

56:39.601 --> 56:41.802
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.

56:41.804 --> 56:44.671
Meryl's wearing a two-piece.

56:47.543 --> 56:50.342
The guy died three years ago
and nobody alerted him.

56:53.112 --> 56:55.180
Thank you so much.
Hey, no problem.

56:55.182 --> 56:58.650
No, I... My dad's really not
a bad guy, Oh, he's fine.

56:58.652 --> 57:01.987
But you caught him on an off day.
No, no. He was fine.

57:01.989 --> 57:05.023
Uh, you know what? What I'll do is,
I'll check up on him next week.

57:05.025 --> 57:06.959
And I told him about this
immune suppressant that...

57:06.961 --> 57:09.661
Will you please
come home with me?

57:09.663 --> 57:12.131
Uh...

57:12.133 --> 57:13.732
Forget it. N-No, no, no.

57:13.734 --> 57:15.333
No. No! No, no, no.
You know what?

57:15.335 --> 57:18.203
Hey, you know what?
Let's, um... Let's get food.

57:18.205 --> 57:22.139
Do you wanna get some food?
Do you wanna get some raviolis?

57:22.141 --> 57:23.808
Raviolis? I'm serious.
Yeah, yeah.

57:23.810 --> 57:26.143
Do you wanna get some raviolis? I
know a place that's around here.

57:26.145 --> 57:28.879
They-They have great raviolis.

57:28.881 --> 57:31.148
I'd love to get raviolis.

57:31.150 --> 57:32.749
Just go to the ravioli place.
Just get 'em.

57:32.751 --> 57:34.650
Yeah. Yeah?

57:50.536 --> 57:52.603
Yeah. Yeah.

57:52.605 --> 57:54.906
Stop doing that.

57:54.908 --> 57:57.508
Why are you breathing weird?
I'm not breathing weird.

58:00.280 --> 58:02.079
What's going on?

58:02.081 --> 58:04.347
I like him so much.

58:04.349 --> 58:06.583
Yeah?

58:06.585 --> 58:10.053
Why do I feel, like, so...
Like, so scared?

58:10.055 --> 58:14.558
Well, because you've always dated dummies
you weren't at risk of actually liking.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.226
C... Can we get a drink? No!

58:16.228 --> 58:17.861
No, no, we can get one drink.
Stop it!

58:17.863 --> 58:19.529
No, I-I... What?

58:19.531 --> 58:21.531
I've been dating for
fucking 90 years.

58:21.533 --> 58:24.067
Something always happens. Why not
this time that I really care?

58:24.069 --> 58:26.069
What could possibly happen? What
do you think is gonna happen?

58:26.071 --> 58:28.371
What if I, like, forget
to flush the toilet...

58:28.373 --> 58:31.074
and there's, like, a
tampon in there? Okay.

58:31.076 --> 58:34.544
And not like a cute, like,
"Oh, it's the last day."

58:34.546 --> 58:36.613
Like, a real tampon.

58:36.615 --> 58:38.448
I'm talking, like,
a crime scene tampon.

58:38.450 --> 58:41.361
Like... Like, the Red
Wedding, Game of Thrones.

58:41.387 --> 58:42.452
Oh, that bloody.

58:42.454 --> 58:45.221
Oh, my gosh! It's like
a Quentin Tarantino,

58:45.223 --> 58:48.725
<i>Django,</i> like, a real
motherfucker of a tampon.

58:48.727 --> 58:50.727
Like you... There's,
like, an ear on it.

58:52.230 --> 58:53.930
You know what I mean though...
Oh, my gosh.

58:53.932 --> 58:55.398
There's, like, deal
breakers, you know?

58:55.400 --> 58:57.099
I know. Oh. Why?

58:57.101 --> 58:58.900
Hey, look who's here! Hey!

58:58.902 --> 59:00.636
This does not seem safe. Hi.

59:00.638 --> 59:02.304
- Whoo!
- Oh, my God.

59:02.306 --> 59:04.139
Always here.

59:04.141 --> 59:06.976
Is Amy crying?
Yeah, she's in love.

59:06.978 --> 59:08.911
Oh, with Steven? No!

59:08.913 --> 59:10.846
- No!
- I love Steven.

59:10.848 --> 59:13.983
He taught me this workout to
get me a beach bod. Okay.

59:13.985 --> 59:15.484
- You look amazing.
- Thank you so much.

59:15.486 --> 59:17.967
You'll be really ripping it up.

59:22.425 --> 59:24.293
Oh! Oh!

59:24.295 --> 59:25.861
That was cool.

59:27.631 --> 59:29.531
- Oh! And there he is!
- Thank you, thank you.

59:29.533 --> 59:31.299
It's LeBron. LeBron!

59:31.301 --> 59:34.135
I'm LeBron James, and welcome
to the Big Apple Jam Fest.

59:36.540 --> 59:39.307
So, are you guys ready
to have some fun?

59:45.215 --> 59:47.048
The Knicks City Dancers!

59:50.686 --> 59:52.053
Whoo!

59:52.055 --> 59:54.389
<i>Y'all ready for this?</i>

59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.395
They're just gyrating.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:03.664
No, they're not. No, no, no. These
girls work really hard. I treat them.

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:06.534
You tre... You treat them? Yes, I do.
I work with them.

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.369
They get bad injuries. I bet.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.570
The pole isn't always
greased right.

01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:15.908
You're gonna lose us
the right to vote!

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.982
How long is this?
I... I don't know.

01:00:22.984 --> 01:00:24.851
Like, I don't know maybe another
hour or something. I'm just asking.

01:00:24.853 --> 01:00:26.319
Okay.

01:00:30.424 --> 01:00:32.525
Whoo!

01:00:32.527 --> 01:00:34.193
Dr. Conners.

01:00:34.195 --> 01:00:36.829
Do you mind taking a look at my ankle?
I think I rolled it.

01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:38.397
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.

01:00:38.399 --> 01:00:41.501
Yeah, I'll-I'll
see you in a sec.

01:00:48.709 --> 01:00:50.543
Hey! Hey.

01:00:50.545 --> 01:00:53.246
You were so great. Everybody flipped
out when you came out here.

01:00:53.248 --> 01:00:55.049
It was cool to see. Thank you.

01:00:57.851 --> 01:01:00.053
But seriously, like,
you know, what's the deal?

01:01:00.055 --> 01:01:01.975
You know,
what's your intentions?

01:01:03.223 --> 01:01:05.458
- My intentions?
- Yeah, with my boy.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.794
- Like, what's your plan?
- Oh, I don't have a plan with Aaron.

01:01:08.796 --> 01:01:12.031
I... No, we've just been dating
for, like, six weeks, and, uh...

01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:13.899
We're just hanging out. Okay.

01:01:13.901 --> 01:01:15.700
Keeping it "cazh."

01:01:15.702 --> 01:01:19.437
So, like, you know, you get
butterflies when you hear his name?

01:01:19.439 --> 01:01:21.272
Excuse me?

01:01:21.274 --> 01:01:23.508
When you're looking at clouds,
do you see his face?

01:01:25.878 --> 01:01:29.199
Do you hear his name when
you listen to the wind?

01:01:29.647 --> 01:01:30.847
Um...

01:01:32.249 --> 01:01:34.283
Yes?

01:01:35.386 --> 01:01:37.754
I really have to
ask you a question.

01:01:37.756 --> 01:01:40.623
Don't hurt him.

01:01:47.399 --> 01:01:50.267
<i>So, we did it. Okay?</i>

01:01:50.269 --> 01:01:51.968
<i>We fell hard for each other.</i>

01:01:53.638 --> 01:01:55.639
<i>Welcome to the whitest
couple in America.</i>

01:01:57.342 --> 01:01:59.309
<i>How did no one mug us that day?</i>

01:01:59.311 --> 01:02:00.977
<i>Look at his hat.</i>

01:02:02.179 --> 01:02:04.013
<i>I know. We're kissing on a rock.</i>

01:02:04.015 --> 01:02:06.697
<i>Do you know how many homeless people
have taken a dump on that rock?</i>

01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:11.320
<i>Subway kissing? Ew.</i>

01:02:11.322 --> 01:02:13.689
<i>I love how tall he is.</i>

01:02:13.691 --> 01:02:16.091
Whoa! Easy, dude.
I'm a working man too.

01:02:16.093 --> 01:02:18.160
All right, I get it. Hey, Noam.

01:02:18.162 --> 01:02:21.863
Hey, guys! Whoa, inside sex.
I'm digging that.

01:02:21.865 --> 01:02:24.132
<i>Even my dad likes him.</i>

01:02:24.134 --> 01:02:25.800
<i>My dad doesn't like anyone.</i>

01:02:25.802 --> 01:02:28.435
<i>He thought Mother Teresa
was full of shit.</i>

01:02:28.437 --> 01:02:31.105
<i>That's my "Aaron's
apartment" toothbrush.</i>

01:02:31.107 --> 01:02:33.707
<i>I have two toothbrushes.</i>

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:38.679
<i>I hope this love montage
ends like Jonestown.</i>

01:02:38.681 --> 01:02:41.882
<i>Ooh! I think this is where
Woody Allen met Soon Yi.</i>

01:02:43.451 --> 01:02:45.318
<i>Okay, okay, easy.</i>

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.387
<i>That was a dare, okay?</i>

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.455
<i>I was dared to do that.</i>

01:02:57.464 --> 01:02:59.030
What's up with you and Amy?
How's that going?

01:02:59.032 --> 01:03:00.332
Amy? Yeah.

01:03:00.334 --> 01:03:01.833
Things are going awesome, man.

01:03:01.835 --> 01:03:03.634
Yeah? Yeah.

01:03:03.636 --> 01:03:06.571
Yeah. It's going real good.

01:03:06.573 --> 01:03:08.239
I mean, I really,
really like her, but...

01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:11.376
she's... she's got
some issues, you know?

01:03:11.378 --> 01:03:14.579
I mean, that's gonna happen.
Yeah.

01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:16.547
It's like, last night we went
out drinking, and, like...

01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:18.316
You? Yeah, I went out drinking.

01:03:18.318 --> 01:03:19.984
And she, uh...

01:03:19.986 --> 01:03:21.585
And, uh...

01:03:21.587 --> 01:03:23.688
We, uh...

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:25.523
You know, I don't drink.
I got hammered.

01:03:25.525 --> 01:03:27.766
And then she drank a lot,
but she didn't... Barely got...

01:03:29.361 --> 01:03:31.562
But she didn't
get drunk at all.

01:03:35.031 --> 01:03:36.499
She's...

01:03:40.403 --> 01:03:42.338
So how's the sex? The sex?

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.906
Why do you always wanna
know this stuff, man?

01:03:43.908 --> 01:03:45.507
Listen, I'm a married man.
Uh-huh.

01:03:45.509 --> 01:03:47.209
I need to live vicariously
through you.

01:03:47.211 --> 01:03:49.211
Just give me a couple of details.
No.

01:03:49.213 --> 01:03:51.880
Just like 11. Eleven details?

01:03:51.882 --> 01:03:53.716
When you're married as long
as me, you'll understand.

01:03:53.718 --> 01:03:57.019
She knows what she wants.
It's great.

01:03:57.021 --> 01:03:59.422
The sex is great.
It's rough. It's wild.

01:03:59.424 --> 01:04:00.956
I mean, if it's not wild,
it's not right.

01:04:00.958 --> 01:04:02.857
Right. But no, it's crazy.

01:04:02.859 --> 01:04:05.527
Like pulling my hair and stuff.
Oh.

01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:08.429
We've never... We haven't
even laid down yet.

01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:12.100
Always either, like, sitting up
or against a wall or something.

01:04:12.102 --> 01:04:14.602
I've never been on top once. Oh.

01:04:14.604 --> 01:04:16.604
We have a safe word. Already?

01:04:16.606 --> 01:04:18.640
Yeah. It's "calypso." Man, it's
pretty early for a safe word.

01:04:18.642 --> 01:04:22.310
It is. Second date,
we had a safe word.

01:04:22.312 --> 01:04:23.779
It's insane, man.

01:04:23.781 --> 01:04:25.614
You ready for this?
Come on, man.

01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:27.983
I've been practicing.
Man, knock it off.

01:04:27.985 --> 01:04:30.466
Ready for this? Ready for this?

01:04:33.555 --> 01:04:37.125
Yeah! Oh. It's foul. Foul?

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:39.460
Yeah, man. You hit me. No.

01:04:39.462 --> 01:04:41.663
You use protection, right? Yeah.

01:04:41.665 --> 01:04:44.565
Yeah, yeah, she's got little bowls
of condoms all around her apartment.

01:04:44.567 --> 01:04:46.600
Condoms? Yeah.

01:04:46.602 --> 01:04:49.337
I'm not talking about condoms. I'm talking
about, like, protection, like a lawyer.

01:04:49.339 --> 01:04:52.173
Like a nondisclosure
agreement, you know? Oh, yeah.

01:04:52.175 --> 01:04:55.243
No penetration
without representation.

01:04:55.245 --> 01:04:57.645
Oh, yeah, you're right.

01:04:57.647 --> 01:05:00.949
Wh... What happened?
Nothing, man.

01:05:00.951 --> 01:05:02.583
Listen, I'll tell you one thing.

01:05:02.585 --> 01:05:04.117
You don't wanna have a baby mama.
Yeah?

01:05:04.119 --> 01:05:05.686
Next thing, you're paying
for a Ferrari.

01:05:05.688 --> 01:05:08.088
Yeah. You getting her a
big house, a big mansion.

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:09.856
She's gonna want
to start a jumpsuit line.

01:05:09.858 --> 01:05:12.326
And you gonna have to pay for it.
You wanna go through that?

01:05:12.328 --> 01:05:15.696
You gotta convince one of your friends
to say he's the dad and raise the child.

01:05:15.698 --> 01:05:19.700
Who wants to go through that? Kid end up
being 6'7 ", and your best friend only 5'2".

01:05:19.702 --> 01:05:21.435
Eighteen years later,
the kid comes...

01:05:21.437 --> 01:05:24.539
and he writes a book about you saying
how much of a jackass you are.

01:05:24.541 --> 01:05:26.774
Yeah. Eighteen years, man.
Eighteen years.

01:05:26.776 --> 01:05:29.477
Your baby mama's car and crib
is bigger than his.

01:05:29.479 --> 01:05:31.712
You could turn on the TV
any given Sunday.

01:05:31.714 --> 01:05:34.548
Win the Super Bowl
and drive off in a Hyundai.

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:37.318
She was supposed to get the
shorty Tyco with your money.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.820
Then she went to the doctor,
got lipo with your money.

01:05:39.822 --> 01:05:42.990
What are you talking about? What
the fuck are you talking about?

01:05:42.992 --> 01:05:45.659
It's Kanye. You're quoting
Kanye West to me?

01:05:45.661 --> 01:05:47.862
You know what?
Amy's not like that.

01:05:47.864 --> 01:05:50.197
Amy's not like that at all.
She's awesome.

01:05:50.199 --> 01:05:51.898
And this is gonna be great.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.542
She's cool, and I don't have to
worry about that. All right.

01:05:56.136 --> 01:05:58.003
Oh! Did you let me do that?

01:05:58.005 --> 01:05:59.672
Did I just score on you?

01:05:59.674 --> 01:06:02.574
Yes! You are my
bitch, LeBron James!

01:06:02.576 --> 01:06:04.642
But not really. Not really.

01:06:04.644 --> 01:06:07.178
You gotta admit, that was a
good shot though. Come on, man.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.080
I scored on LeBron James. I'm
never playing basketball again.

01:06:10.082 --> 01:06:11.682
Lunch is on you, buddy!

01:06:11.684 --> 01:06:13.884
Where you going, Aaron? Whoo!

01:06:13.886 --> 01:06:15.385
Aaron!

01:06:17.055 --> 01:06:18.555
LeBron.

01:06:20.224 --> 01:06:22.225
Whoo!

01:06:22.227 --> 01:06:23.727
Goddamn it!

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:27.963
How's work?

01:06:29.499 --> 01:06:31.933
Work's great, actually.

01:06:31.935 --> 01:06:34.235
I think I'm gonna
get that editor job.

01:06:34.237 --> 01:06:37.272
Yeah, Aaron's been kind of
pushing me to think bigger.

01:06:37.274 --> 01:06:39.941
Can I just do this, please?

01:06:39.943 --> 01:06:42.477
Aaron was telling me about
this acupuncturist.

01:06:42.503 --> 01:06:43.879
She's supposedly amazing.

01:06:43.881 --> 01:06:46.381
She helps a lot of his patients
with pain management.

01:06:46.383 --> 01:06:49.351
I really want her to take a look at you.
Will you do that?

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:52.420
I have no desire for an Oriental
woman to touch me above the waist.

01:06:52.422 --> 01:06:54.589
Don't say that.
That's disgust...

01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:56.290
It's "Asian." Just say "Asian."

01:06:56.292 --> 01:06:59.594
Why does Aaron all of a sudden
know everything about everything?

01:06:59.596 --> 01:07:02.597
He's a doctor.
He knows something.

01:07:02.599 --> 01:07:04.799
He's a sports doctor. That's not
a real doctor. Let's face it.

01:07:04.801 --> 01:07:07.235
A real doctor
tries to cure diseases.

01:07:07.237 --> 01:07:09.804
He's trying to get courtside
seats for the play-offs.

01:07:09.806 --> 01:07:12.107
You're saying sports doctors
aren't real doctors?

01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:15.243
Yeah. When they said, "What do you wanna
focus on?" "I wanna focus on MS."

01:07:15.245 --> 01:07:17.613
"What do you wanna focus on?"
"I wanna focus on cancer."

01:07:17.615 --> 01:07:19.381
"What about you?"
"I don't give a f...

01:07:19.383 --> 01:07:21.916
Whatever gets me closest
to men's locker rooms."

01:07:21.918 --> 01:07:23.618
Okay. That's really...

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.487
"I want giant, athletic
penises close to my face...

01:07:26.489 --> 01:07:28.288
while I'm pretending
to look at their knees."

01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:30.958
He's a good doctor, and he does a
lot with Doctors Without Borders.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.560
He's a great guy. I'm not
saying he's not a good guy,

01:07:33.562 --> 01:07:37.764
but he's got about a month left
before you give him the boot, right?

01:07:37.766 --> 01:07:39.565
What does that mean?

01:07:39.567 --> 01:07:42.402
He's a reaction from
the muscle-bound knucklehead,

01:07:42.404 --> 01:07:44.737
so now you go
for the nerdy brainiac.

01:07:44.739 --> 01:07:48.074
I know the way your pattern works, Amy.
I... It's my pattern.

01:07:48.076 --> 01:07:49.842
No, Dad, I really like him.

01:07:49.844 --> 01:07:52.845
And I just want you to be nice to him.
I want you to take it seriously.

01:07:52.847 --> 01:07:54.970
Will you do that? I think
we have a real shot.

01:07:54.996 --> 01:07:55.782
That's great.

01:07:55.784 --> 01:07:57.650
You sound like a Lifetime movie.

01:07:57.652 --> 01:08:00.020
One of the happy ones,
not the murder ones.

01:08:00.022 --> 01:08:02.489
Don't you want me
to be happy? I mean...

01:08:02.491 --> 01:08:05.793
You're building him up, and you're
gonna let yourself in for a big fall.

01:08:05.795 --> 01:08:07.561
He's gonna break your heart.

01:08:09.864 --> 01:08:12.132
I'm leaving.
I'll talk to you later.

01:08:12.134 --> 01:08:14.467
I'll tell Temembe
to come get you.

01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:18.171
Amy, don't walk...
Don't leave like this.

01:08:18.173 --> 01:08:21.207
I don't like it when you don't
talk to me for a while.

01:08:29.517 --> 01:08:31.317
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.952
Oh, no, I wanna be
doing this with you.

01:08:33.953 --> 01:08:36.020
It's the only one I've ever
done that we've framed.

01:08:36.023 --> 01:08:37.721
It looks great.

01:08:37.724 --> 01:08:39.557
- It seems like a regional thing.
- - Well...

01:08:39.559 --> 01:08:42.560
Hey. Hi.

01:08:42.563 --> 01:08:44.194
Hi. Hey. I'm Aaron.

01:08:44.197 --> 01:08:46.063
I'm Kim. So nice to meet you.
Kim.

01:08:46.064 --> 01:08:47.826
It's really nice to meet you.
You're Tom? Tom.

01:08:47.852 --> 01:08:48.800
Pleasure to meet you.

01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:51.135
Hey, Amy. How are you?

01:08:51.136 --> 01:08:53.304
Congrats on trapping my
sister with your seed.

01:08:53.305 --> 01:08:56.240
Well, not all sex ends
with a flush and a cry.

01:08:56.242 --> 01:08:58.075
You know,
sometimes you get this.

01:08:58.077 --> 01:08:59.844
- That's killer.
- Come on in!

01:08:59.845 --> 01:09:01.545
This is Wendy and Kyle.

01:09:01.546 --> 01:09:02.812
Hello. Hi.

01:09:02.814 --> 01:09:04.014
It's great to see you.

01:09:05.917 --> 01:09:08.149
Oh, nice. Very good.

01:09:08.152 --> 01:09:11.319
What does that mean?
"Welcome to our party."

01:09:11.322 --> 01:09:14.221
It's Portuguese.
Rolm's teaching me.

01:09:14.224 --> 01:09:17.725
That's our son Rolm. We adopted
him about six months ago.

01:09:17.728 --> 01:09:20.694
Yeah, we've been teaching him, but
really, he's been teaching us.

01:09:20.697 --> 01:09:25.033
Yeah. How to protect ourselves.
How to stand up for ourselves.

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:27.935
- He has night terrors.
- Lotta lessons really quick.

01:09:27.937 --> 01:09:31.205
He's a very strong presence
in our house.

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:33.072
Um, we love you.

01:09:35.443 --> 01:09:37.076
Yeah. Lot of lessons.

01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:39.711
How to get along with,
essentially, a stranger...

01:09:39.712 --> 01:09:42.180
who refuses to learn English.

01:09:42.183 --> 01:09:44.550
He doesn't know his birthday.
He says around eight,

01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:46.718
but the dentist said
he was 12 at least.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.522
They know. Yeah, he's through puberty.
For sure.

01:09:50.524 --> 01:09:53.893
- Oh.
- Yeah, he was so small in the e-mail,

01:09:53.895 --> 01:09:56.629
but... he's shot up.

01:09:56.631 --> 01:09:58.397
Come on in the party.

01:09:58.399 --> 01:10:02.034
There's drinks on the deck and there's
food in the kitchen over here.

01:10:06.272 --> 01:10:08.206
I haven't been to
a baby shower in years.

01:10:08.208 --> 01:10:10.943
We're so glad you made it. Yeah.
Hey, congratulations, man.

01:10:10.945 --> 01:10:13.879
So, I hear that you
work with athletes.

01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:15.981
Yeah. I'm a physician
and a surgeon.

01:10:15.983 --> 01:10:18.150
Mostly work with the Knicks
right now, but, uh...

01:10:18.152 --> 01:10:19.951
Oh! Very cool.

01:10:19.953 --> 01:10:22.253
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
And other athletes.

01:10:22.255 --> 01:10:23.421
Oh. Wow.

01:10:23.423 --> 01:10:25.890
Really?
Like... Like, which ones?

01:10:25.892 --> 01:10:28.459
Specifically, which athletes?

01:10:28.461 --> 01:10:31.262
Uh, Tom Brady.

01:10:31.264 --> 01:10:32.896
Yeah. Wow.

01:10:32.898 --> 01:10:35.132
Any other athletes
that you, uh, work with?

01:10:35.134 --> 01:10:37.934
Uh, Jay Cutler. Whoa!

01:10:37.936 --> 01:10:40.102
Yeah, I work with him.
Um... He's awesome.

01:10:40.104 --> 01:10:42.405
Do you guys follow tennis? Yeah.

01:10:42.407 --> 01:10:45.307
- Rog-Roger Federer?
- Whoa.

01:10:45.309 --> 01:10:46.909
Uh, Robert Griffin.

01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:48.777
Cool!

01:10:48.779 --> 01:10:51.412
Chris Paul. CP3.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.448
- Alex Rodriguez.
- Fuck that guy.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:56.284
I agree. Yeah.

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:58.719
Fuck him. Piece of shit.

01:11:01.522 --> 01:11:03.356
Clayton Kershaw.

01:11:03.358 --> 01:11:05.359
Oh! Yeah!

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.194
Amy, he's great.

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:08.828
Yeah, where did you find him?

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:10.496
We... Uh... Work.

01:11:10.498 --> 01:11:13.666
Well, you two are
really cute together.

01:11:13.668 --> 01:11:16.268
You two would have
the most perfect babies.

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:18.504
I could just eat you up.
You know?

01:11:18.506 --> 01:11:21.139
Yeah, it seems a little early
for this kind of talk, so...

01:11:21.141 --> 01:11:22.941
It's not. If
anything, it's late.

01:11:22.943 --> 01:11:26.844
My life did not begin
until I had kids.

01:11:26.846 --> 01:11:28.847
Your life has not begun.

01:11:28.849 --> 01:11:32.183
Yeah, you know, I'm... I'm
pretty happy right now, so...

01:11:32.185 --> 01:11:34.185
Aaron, do you want a family?

01:11:34.187 --> 01:11:37.989
Um, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think I'd like
to have two kids by the time I'm 40.

01:11:37.991 --> 01:11:39.657
- At least. Right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:39.659 --> 01:11:42.160
Two is tight. It's tight.

01:11:42.162 --> 01:11:45.329
If I were you, I would start thinking
about having them as soon as possible.

01:11:45.331 --> 01:11:47.065
Just breathe. Just breathe.
It's fine.

01:11:47.067 --> 01:11:49.033
He wants to have kids.
Like, right now. Amy.

01:11:49.035 --> 01:11:50.667
People talk about that.
Not really.

01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:52.201
It's fine. I don't know
anyone that talks about that.

01:11:52.203 --> 01:11:53.870
He's great. It's normal.

01:11:53.872 --> 01:11:55.638
I think Aaron's great.
I really like him.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.673
Can you tell the members of
Heaven's Gate in there to relax?

01:11:57.675 --> 01:11:59.308
No, he's too nice.
He's not too nice.

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:01.143
Yes, he is. He's too nice for me.
You know it.

01:12:01.145 --> 01:12:03.712
No, Am... I... No. He's the perfect
amount of nice that you deserve.

01:12:03.714 --> 01:12:05.815
There's deal breakers
across the board with him.

01:12:05.817 --> 01:12:08.083
Like, the sex is good.
It's, like, really good.

01:12:08.085 --> 01:12:10.719
Like, it's great, but it's not,
like, the best I've ever had.

01:12:10.721 --> 01:12:12.420
You know? Yeah, right.

01:12:12.422 --> 01:12:14.488
You don't want "best sex
that you've ever had guy."

01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:17.191
No, you wanna stay with the
"best you've ever had guy."

01:12:17.193 --> 01:12:19.593
You don't. That's a creepy guy.
You don't wanna be with that guy.

01:12:19.595 --> 01:12:22.329
"Best sex that you've
ever had guy" is in jail.

01:12:22.331 --> 01:12:24.865
You know what I mean? Yeah.

01:12:24.867 --> 01:12:27.367
But I've been thinking about
maybe reaching out to him.

01:12:27.369 --> 01:12:29.837
Stop. Amy, breathe.
It's fine. He's great.

01:12:29.839 --> 01:12:31.371
You're ridiculous. Mother.

01:12:31.373 --> 01:12:33.072
I'm not ready for...

01:12:33.074 --> 01:12:36.155
If I kiss the belly hard
enough, will the baby feel it?

01:12:37.577 --> 01:12:39.344
You wanna try?

01:12:41.048 --> 01:12:43.014
I think that
the baby did feel it.

01:12:46.217 --> 01:12:48.252
No.

01:12:48.254 --> 01:12:50.554
Kim's great, man. Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

01:12:50.556 --> 01:12:52.589
She's really awesome.
Kim's the best.

01:12:52.591 --> 01:12:54.191
I'm glad I finally got
to meet her.

01:12:54.193 --> 01:12:56.860
Yeah, and Amy's great,
too, by the way.

01:12:56.862 --> 01:12:59.096
Like, I just love her.

01:12:59.098 --> 01:13:03.299
But keep her away from those pro athletes.
You know what I mean?

01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:04.934
Wait. What does that mean?

01:13:04.936 --> 01:13:06.602
Um...

01:13:06.604 --> 01:13:08.303
No, like, it was a joke.

01:13:08.305 --> 01:13:10.071
Like, that she'd
sleep with them.

01:13:10.073 --> 01:13:11.940
I don't get the joke angle.

01:13:11.942 --> 01:13:14.642
Well, the... N-No,
not that she would, but...

01:13:14.644 --> 01:13:16.745
Those are the kinds
of jokes she tells.

01:13:16.747 --> 01:13:20.115
Like... Like, "I'm loose.
I'm a whore." Or whatever.

01:13:20.117 --> 01:13:21.816
That's my girlfriend.
No. I know.

01:13:21.818 --> 01:13:23.718
It's not my joke. It's her...

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.286
Those are the kind
of jokes she tells,

01:13:25.288 --> 01:13:27.755
which I'm not, like, for at all.

01:13:27.757 --> 01:13:30.058
Like, I'm always like, "Don't
tell these kinds of jokes."

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.727
And then she does. I'm like,
"There she goes again."

01:13:32.729 --> 01:13:35.831
Really? But I'm just like...
Just forget I said this.

01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:40.468
Just, like, drag that one to
trash and just empty trash.

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:42.003
Oh.

01:13:45.841 --> 01:13:48.810
The game is Skeletons in the Closet.
Okay.

01:13:48.812 --> 01:13:52.312
We all have to admit things
we've never told anyone before.

01:13:52.314 --> 01:13:53.947
No! No, Wendy.

01:13:53.949 --> 01:13:55.615
Yes! I'm already embarrassed.

01:13:55.617 --> 01:13:57.016
Yes, we have to.
We have to do it.

01:13:57.018 --> 01:13:58.417
Okay, okay.

01:13:58.419 --> 01:14:01.320
Sometimes,
after Kyle falls asleep,

01:14:01.322 --> 01:14:03.689
I get up and eat Skinny
Cow ice cream pops.

01:14:03.691 --> 01:14:06.292
- No!
- No, you don't. You should be asleep.

01:14:06.294 --> 01:14:09.094
I know. Sometimes I have
the whole box. What?

01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:12.364
That's like an... a whole regular-size
ice cream if you eat the whole box.

01:14:12.366 --> 01:14:15.333
I know. I know. Your turn.

01:14:15.335 --> 01:14:17.469
Okay. Um,

01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:22.206
last week, I let my
six-year-old watch <i> Glee.</i>

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:24.642
Too soon.
I know. I know. I know.

01:14:24.644 --> 01:14:26.210
- That show's very racy.
- She's six years old.

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:28.880
There were some, um, homosexual undertones.
I will say that.

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:31.816
There were two girls
kissing in this episode.

01:14:31.818 --> 01:14:34.451
And you know, I haven't even explained
to them what gay people are.

01:14:34.453 --> 01:14:36.387
- Uh, they're people?
- Yeah.

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:39.356
Okay, okay. Amy, your turn.

01:14:39.358 --> 01:14:42.326
Um, I don't know
how I'm gonna follow these.

01:14:42.328 --> 01:14:45.028
They were so good.
You guys are really brave.

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:46.864
Thanks for trusting.

01:14:46.866 --> 01:14:52.001
Um, one time,
I had sex with this guy,

01:14:52.003 --> 01:14:53.703
and we couldn't find the condom.

01:14:53.705 --> 01:14:58.374
So three days later, I found out
it was attached to my cervix.

01:14:58.376 --> 01:15:00.677
It had been, like,
kind of pounded up there.

01:15:00.679 --> 01:15:03.546
And, uh, so I googled
what do I do, right?

01:15:03.548 --> 01:15:08.751
So it said just kind of bear down,
you know, and just fish it out.

01:15:08.753 --> 01:15:11.020
Like, with... Uh, you know,
make your finger a hook.

01:15:11.022 --> 01:15:13.722
So I just, you know, like,
hooked my finger like this...

01:15:13.724 --> 01:15:17.827
and then just kind of beared down
and just got it out of there.

01:15:24.568 --> 01:15:28.436
I let Tim and his brothers tag
team me on Christmas morning.

01:15:28.438 --> 01:15:31.572
And you know what?
It was wonderful.

01:15:33.675 --> 01:15:35.109
I like her.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.353
<i>Hi.</i> Hi.

01:15:48.355 --> 01:15:49.921
<i>How are you?</i> Can you come over?

01:15:49.923 --> 01:15:51.522
<i>No. I'm working.</i>

01:15:51.524 --> 01:15:53.224
Is this about the baby shower?

01:15:53.226 --> 01:15:56.427
'Cause I'm sorry I wasn't nicer
to The Real Housewives of Hell.

01:15:56.429 --> 01:15:59.063
No, it's fine. It's fine.
It's not about that.

01:15:59.065 --> 01:16:00.697
What's up?

01:16:00.699 --> 01:16:04.868
<i>Um, Dad died.</i>

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:08.371
<i>He was hoarding his medication
and his heart gave out.</i>

01:16:11.542 --> 01:16:13.142
<i>Amy?</i>

01:16:14.911 --> 01:16:16.344
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:16:19.082 --> 01:16:20.982
A little change? A penny?

01:16:20.984 --> 01:16:23.552
A nickel? A ruble?

01:16:23.554 --> 01:16:25.820
Crowd fund this.
Come on. Help me out.

01:16:34.431 --> 01:16:36.665
Thank you.

01:16:36.667 --> 01:16:38.166
Um...

01:16:52.349 --> 01:16:55.652
I had a... I had
a black boyfriend once.

01:16:55.654 --> 01:16:57.935
Your mother must be proud.

01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:01.557
Yep.

01:17:03.092 --> 01:17:05.828
And I'd do it a...
I'd do it again.

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:08.030
Hello.

01:17:09.098 --> 01:17:10.933
Thank you for coming.

01:17:14.603 --> 01:17:16.938
Gordon David Townsend.

01:17:19.374 --> 01:17:21.708
Not that great of a guy.

01:17:22.944 --> 01:17:26.012
He was kind of racist...

01:17:26.014 --> 01:17:28.548
and homophobic.

01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:30.449
He was a drunk.

01:17:32.685 --> 01:17:34.953
He was a drunk.

01:17:34.955 --> 01:17:38.455
He once apologized to me for
missing a volleyball game...

01:17:38.457 --> 01:17:40.791
that he was at.

01:17:40.793 --> 01:17:45.027
He had, um, made signs
with my name on them.

01:17:47.198 --> 01:17:51.332
When I was 11,
this kid, Brandon Lipinsky...

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:54.135
Remember Brandon?
He stole my bike.

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:57.671
Maybe he was just borrowing it,

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.908
but our dad went over there and beat
the shit out of Brandon's dad...

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:04.077
and his grandpa and Brandon.

01:18:08.716 --> 01:18:11.351
I bet he personally
offended everyone here.

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:14.220
Right? Raise your hand
if our dad ever offended you.

01:18:20.761 --> 01:18:22.395
Yeah.

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:25.097
He was an asshole.

01:18:25.099 --> 01:18:28.901
When I asked him to tell me the story
of how he proposed to our mom,

01:18:28.903 --> 01:18:32.104
his response was "Who?"

01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:38.244
And I know he was joking.
He loved her a lot.

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:39.745
But, uh...

01:18:45.885 --> 01:18:49.688
He was really sick
for a really long time.

01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:53.358
Which isn't fair,

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.128
because I don't think anyone
else was more alive than him...

01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:58.796
when he was younger.

01:19:01.766 --> 01:19:05.136
He thought it was payback.
He thought it was karma.

01:19:05.138 --> 01:19:08.371
And that's why he got sick.
But I don't think so.

01:19:10.575 --> 01:19:13.443
I think he was the greatest dad.

01:19:13.445 --> 01:19:17.214
He always made me feel
loved and important.

01:19:18.416 --> 01:19:20.917
I know he fucked up.

01:19:20.919 --> 01:19:24.554
I know he probably
hurt everyone here.

01:19:24.556 --> 01:19:27.390
But raise your hand if he was
one of your favorite people.

01:19:32.897 --> 01:19:34.999
He was my favorite person.

01:19:42.574 --> 01:19:44.041
Thank you.

01:19:52.285 --> 01:19:53.718
You all right?

01:19:56.621 --> 01:20:00.062
This makes me wish they'd
found my father's remains.

01:20:06.832 --> 01:20:08.332
- I'll cook?
- Yeah.

01:20:08.334 --> 01:20:10.576
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

01:20:11.336 --> 01:20:12.536
Hey.

01:20:20.445 --> 01:20:23.014
Mother, can we go
to La Poubelle now?

01:20:23.016 --> 01:20:24.615
Yeah. Sure, honey.

01:20:24.617 --> 01:20:26.316
How about a piece of pizza?

01:20:26.318 --> 01:20:28.552
So Mom doesn't have to take
you to a French restaurant.

01:20:28.554 --> 01:20:30.220
Pizza has gluten in it.

01:20:30.222 --> 01:20:32.121
Who gives a shit? I'm sorry.

01:20:32.123 --> 01:20:33.789
Amy. I'm just kidding.

01:20:33.791 --> 01:20:36.832
We're just... I'll put
Allister in the car.

01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:41.665
Can we have one second?

01:20:41.667 --> 01:20:43.400
I'm joking.

01:20:44.835 --> 01:20:46.469
I'm not in the mood today.

01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:49.338
I'm not in the mood
for the jokes today.

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.972
Thought you'd be
in a great mood.

01:20:50.974 --> 01:20:53.909
You don't have to pay
for Dad's nursing home anymore.

01:20:53.911 --> 01:20:56.177
What are you doing?

01:20:56.179 --> 01:20:58.480
What? Don't push me away today.

01:20:58.482 --> 01:21:01.583
I'm pushing you away? Yes.

01:21:01.585 --> 01:21:05.420
You've been running away from
this fucking family forever.

01:21:05.422 --> 01:21:07.655
Amy, I am not a crazy person...

01:21:07.657 --> 01:21:10.157
because I got married and
got pregnant with a child.

01:21:10.159 --> 01:21:11.859
That's what people do.

01:21:11.861 --> 01:21:14.361
Why are you even here?
You didn't even like him.

01:21:14.363 --> 01:21:17.832
I did everything. You don't get to
pretend today like you gave a fuck.

01:21:17.834 --> 01:21:20.000
I think that's enough
for today, Amy.

01:21:20.002 --> 01:21:21.433
We ought to go.

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.038
Hey. Hey. Fuck.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.739
Hey.

01:21:27.741 --> 01:21:30.075
You okay? Yeah. I'm good.

01:21:30.077 --> 01:21:32.510
Okay? You ready to go?
Yeah, let's go.

01:21:32.512 --> 01:21:36.180
Hey, I just want you to know,
I really care about you, okay?

01:21:36.182 --> 01:21:38.248
And I love you. Thank you.

01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:41.852
What? Are you seriously
saying that to me today?

01:21:41.854 --> 01:21:44.921
You're gonna say that to me, seriously,
for the first time right now?

01:21:44.923 --> 01:21:47.724
They're putting dirt
on my dad's body behind you.

01:21:47.726 --> 01:21:50.626
Today is the day you say that?
Let's go.

01:21:50.628 --> 01:21:52.795
I... Is that bad?
Yes, that's bad.

01:21:52.797 --> 01:21:54.463
- Bad timing.
- Sorry about that.

01:21:54.465 --> 01:21:56.698
I'm sorry. Is this us?

01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.101
We're way down there.

01:21:59.535 --> 01:22:01.569
Is this us? No.

01:22:01.571 --> 01:22:03.604
There's the car.

01:22:03.606 --> 01:22:05.907
Can he pull up? Do we have his number?
Is this us?

01:22:05.909 --> 01:22:09.510
I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry.

01:22:43.617 --> 01:22:44.917
Hey.

01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:46.819
How's it going, sweetheart?

01:22:46.821 --> 01:22:49.621
I'm getting by. Mm-hmm.

01:22:49.623 --> 01:22:52.424
Thank you for coming the other day.
That was really nice. I...

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:54.459
I can't believe he's gone.
Mm-hmm.

01:22:54.461 --> 01:22:56.761
I'm literally just sitting
here waiting for him to call.

01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:59.965
It feels like a... like a...
a dream or something.

01:22:59.967 --> 01:23:02.168
Are we still talking about this?

01:23:03.469 --> 01:23:06.939
That was eight days ago.
<i>I'm</i> over it.

01:23:06.941 --> 01:23:11.043
It was hard, but I'm over it.
Sorry.

01:23:11.045 --> 01:23:13.378
Best way to grieve...

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.879
don't do it.

01:23:16.716 --> 01:23:18.817
Don't. No. No. Don't grieve.

01:23:18.819 --> 01:23:21.853
Yeah. I've got
good news for you.

01:23:21.855 --> 01:23:25.357
Um, you know that story... that, you
know, Mr. Dr. Boring sports guy?

01:23:25.359 --> 01:23:27.125
Yeah. Well, uh, I cut it.

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:29.628
I mean, I know you weren't in love
with that piece anyway, but...

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:32.998
No, no, no. I was very in love with that.
I-I love that piece.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.881
There's nothing happening.
There's no tension.

01:23:34.907 --> 01:23:35.801
There's no sex appeal.

01:23:35.803 --> 01:23:38.470
He's a bore. Did you
see the pictures?

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:41.574
You know, we did a photo shoot.
Look at him.

01:23:41.576 --> 01:23:45.811
Personally, I don't like his odd
bird face, but we tried everything.

01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:48.514
We tried a ball.
Supposed to be a sports guy.

01:23:48.516 --> 01:23:50.333
I don't think he'd ever
touched a ball before.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.183
Not that kind anyway.

01:23:51.185 --> 01:23:53.586
And there he is. Look at him standing
there, stiff as a scarecrow.

01:23:53.588 --> 01:23:55.220
These guys, they're hot, right?

01:23:55.222 --> 01:23:58.524
We even got him wet.
I mean, would you fuck that?

01:23:58.526 --> 01:24:00.025
Sure. You would?

01:24:00.027 --> 01:24:01.926
I wouldn't fuck that
with <i> your</i> dick.

01:24:01.928 --> 01:24:05.096
No. We decided to go with "Ugliest
Celebrity Kids Under Six."

01:24:05.098 --> 01:24:06.864
Let's get this done, Amy,

01:24:06.866 --> 01:24:09.067
or we are not talking promotion.

01:24:09.068 --> 01:24:10.870
Good girl. Mm-hmm.

01:24:15.873 --> 01:24:18.608
You almost ready? Yeah. I
need, like, two seconds.

01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:21.277
How you feeling about
Amar'e's surgery tomorrow?

01:24:21.279 --> 01:24:23.013
I don't feel
any pressure at all.

01:24:23.015 --> 01:24:25.015
You know, if it doesn't work,
it's just the end of his career.

01:24:25.017 --> 01:24:28.052
But... Feel fine.

01:24:28.054 --> 01:24:30.120
I can't breathe in this.
You look great.

01:24:30.122 --> 01:24:31.221
Yeah? Yeah.

01:24:31.223 --> 01:24:33.022
Thanks.

01:24:33.024 --> 01:24:35.625
Now, is that a formal dress?
Or what is it?

01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:38.894
Yeah. I mean, it's, like...

01:24:38.896 --> 01:24:40.730
There's flowers on it.

01:24:40.732 --> 01:24:42.531
It's, like, shiny, kind of.

01:24:42.533 --> 01:24:44.099
Is it too short? I mean...

01:24:44.101 --> 01:24:46.702
No, no, no, no. Just, uh...

01:24:46.704 --> 01:24:49.638
These people are... They're
real conservative, and, uh...

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.773
You know. Okay, so...

01:24:51.775 --> 01:24:54.810
- They're more gown...
- Oh, yeah. A gown?

01:24:54.812 --> 01:24:56.912
Do you want me to just go
into my gown closet?

01:24:56.914 --> 01:24:58.781
No, no. Nah!

01:24:58.783 --> 01:25:01.550
Would you grab my tiara? It's
right next to my pearls and all...

01:25:01.552 --> 01:25:03.385
Forget I said anything.
Forget I said anything.

01:25:03.387 --> 01:25:05.921
I didn't mean anything. I know nothing
about fashion. You look beautiful.

01:25:05.923 --> 01:25:07.789
You're crazy hot. Let's go.

01:25:15.564 --> 01:25:17.632
You look beautiful. I
look like a dickhead.

01:25:17.634 --> 01:25:19.634
Why didn't you tell me
this was so fancy?

01:25:19.636 --> 01:25:23.472
Oh, come on, it's nice. You
look really nice. I'm serious.

01:25:23.474 --> 01:25:26.074
Congratulations. Maybe we can talk a
little later about another charity.

01:25:26.076 --> 01:25:27.809
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

01:25:27.811 --> 01:25:29.645
Arnold, from Somalia.
Hey, how are you? Hey!

01:25:29.647 --> 01:25:32.080
Good to see you, Arnold.
All right. Tables.

01:25:32.082 --> 01:25:34.316
Enjoy the day. You've earned it.
Oh. Thank you, buddy.

01:25:34.318 --> 01:25:36.084
Thanks.

01:25:36.086 --> 01:25:38.986
Dr. Conners, welcome. Hi.
Hi. Hi. How are you?

01:25:38.988 --> 01:25:40.755
Do you mind if I grab you
just for a minute...

01:25:40.757 --> 01:25:42.356
to go over some things?
Sure. Sure, sure.

01:25:42.358 --> 01:25:43.957
I'll be right back, okay? Okay.

01:25:43.959 --> 01:25:45.625
I'll just... Yeah. I'm fine.

01:25:45.627 --> 01:25:47.094
Okay.

01:26:03.145 --> 01:26:05.013
Would you like some more wine?

01:26:05.015 --> 01:26:06.647
Yeah. That'd be great.

01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:09.716
- Hey, it's a luncheon.
- It's wine.

01:26:09.718 --> 01:26:12.085
I'll have some more.

01:26:14.788 --> 01:26:16.022
Thank you.

01:26:16.024 --> 01:26:18.124
Thanks, everyone.

01:26:18.126 --> 01:26:19.558
I'm Tony Romo.

01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.196
Soccer? Football.

01:26:24.198 --> 01:26:26.131
Tell you what, I don't get
cheered in New York very often,

01:26:26.133 --> 01:26:28.200
so this is a rare treat
for me this evening.

01:26:28.202 --> 01:26:30.535
Dallas suck!

01:26:30.537 --> 01:26:32.703
That's Amar'e Stoudemire,
if you guys do not know.

01:26:32.705 --> 01:26:35.640
He's been following
me around all week.

01:26:35.642 --> 01:26:40.379
Anyway, we're here today to talk
about our esteemed recipient.

01:26:40.381 --> 01:26:42.714
No athlete wants
to go under the knife.

01:26:42.716 --> 01:26:46.085
But when you do, you feel
comfortable with Dr. Conners.

01:26:46.087 --> 01:26:47.886
He's not just changing
professional athletes...

01:26:47.888 --> 01:26:49.587
and the way they
look at medicine.

01:26:49.589 --> 01:26:51.889
He's also changing the world.
And he's helping everybody.

01:26:51.891 --> 01:26:54.158
From pandemics
to war-torn regions,

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.727
to extreme poverty situations,

01:26:56.729 --> 01:26:58.663
they feel safe in his hands.

01:26:58.665 --> 01:27:02.233
To our MVP and to my good
friend, Dr. Aaron Conners.

01:27:02.235 --> 01:27:04.336
Wish me luck.

01:27:04.338 --> 01:27:05.978
Good luck. Thanks.

01:27:15.681 --> 01:27:17.182
Wow. Hey. Look at this.

01:27:17.184 --> 01:27:18.649
Great.

01:27:21.085 --> 01:27:23.253
Look at this. Very nice.

01:27:23.255 --> 01:27:25.355
Very nice of you guys.

01:27:25.357 --> 01:27:27.190
It's very sharp.

01:27:27.192 --> 01:27:30.961
I'll be doing the surgery
tomorrow with this, Amar'e.

01:27:30.963 --> 01:27:33.396
And remember, don't eat
anything after midnight.

01:27:33.398 --> 01:27:35.399
I'm hungry!

01:27:35.401 --> 01:27:39.603
Uh... But I really...

01:27:39.605 --> 01:27:41.806
I really wanna thank the actual
heroes from Doctors Without Borders.

01:27:41.808 --> 01:27:43.774
Sorry.

01:27:43.776 --> 01:27:45.910
Mark Twain said, "Be careful
about reading health books."

01:27:45.912 --> 01:27:47.978
You may die of a misprint."

01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:49.479
Shit.

01:27:49.481 --> 01:27:51.581
Uh... Hello?

01:27:51.583 --> 01:27:53.317
<i>Amy, it's Dianna.</i> Hi, Dianna.

01:27:53.319 --> 01:27:55.552
<i>We really need to talk.</i>
I'm sorry.

01:27:55.554 --> 01:27:57.787
Actually, it's a really bad time.
Is there any chance I can...

01:27:57.789 --> 01:27:59.790
<i>No, I don't wanna hear
that it's a bad time.</i>

01:27:59.792 --> 01:28:01.825
Yeah, but maybe
in, like, an hour.

01:28:01.827 --> 01:28:04.595
<i>You can be replaced within the
hour by 90 other girls...</i>

01:28:04.597 --> 01:28:06.430
<i>who graduated from places...</i>

01:28:06.432 --> 01:28:09.666
<i>better than whatever state school
you blew your way through.</i>

01:28:09.668 --> 01:28:12.503
I'm stepping out.
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

01:28:12.505 --> 01:28:15.138
<i>For fuck's sake!</i> Um...

01:28:16.641 --> 01:28:18.375
This, uh...

01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:21.912
Uh, this organization
came into my life at a time...

01:28:21.914 --> 01:28:24.114
when I was looking
to truly make a difference.

01:28:24.116 --> 01:28:25.915
<i>Which of these
can we live without?</i>

01:28:25.917 --> 01:28:28.118
<i>"We Forgive You,
Lance Armstrong,".</i>

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.019
<i>"The Inventor
of the Pussy Magnet"...</i>

01:28:30.021 --> 01:28:33.188
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. <i>And "Are you
Gay or is She Just Boring?"</i>

01:28:33.190 --> 01:28:34.990
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:28:34.992 --> 01:28:36.791
Uh, is a family.

01:28:36.793 --> 01:28:39.193
And it's a family that I'm very,
very happy to be a part of.

01:28:39.195 --> 01:28:41.829
Thank you guys very much.
It's very nice of you.

01:28:41.831 --> 01:28:44.364
Thank you.

01:28:47.335 --> 01:28:49.735
Thank you. Thank you.

01:28:58.814 --> 01:29:00.347
Hey.

01:29:01.849 --> 01:29:03.783
Hey. I was just coming in
to watch you.

01:29:03.785 --> 01:29:05.452
Yeah, you missed it.

01:29:05.454 --> 01:29:07.687
Shit. I got a phone call.
How'd it go?

01:29:07.689 --> 01:29:09.689
Look, Amy, I know you're going
through a lot right now,

01:29:09.691 --> 01:29:12.359
but I... I really... I really
needed you in there.

01:29:12.361 --> 01:29:14.160
Instead, you're out here,
smoking weed.

01:29:14.162 --> 01:29:15.795
No, I didn't come out here
to smoke pot.

01:29:15.797 --> 01:29:18.464
I came out because, um...
because Dianna called.

01:29:18.466 --> 01:29:20.899
Amy, I really, really
needed you out there.

01:29:20.901 --> 01:29:22.635
You were my lifeline.
You knew that.

01:29:22.637 --> 01:29:24.370
I really can't take you seriously
when you're holding that.

01:29:24.372 --> 01:29:26.338
Why... Why'd you carry
your award out here?

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.407
You don't have to carry it around
like Anne Hathaway at an Oscar party.

01:29:28.409 --> 01:29:29.975
Can you put it down so I can...

01:29:29.977 --> 01:29:31.910
It's just... That's crazy, Amy.

01:29:31.912 --> 01:29:34.246
You knew I wanted
to do that speech to <i> you.</i>

01:29:34.248 --> 01:29:36.581
Yeah, I'm so sorry. I-I-I'm...

01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:38.151
I really didn't wanna
miss it, but I-I was...

01:29:38.177 --> 01:29:39.650
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my job right now.

01:29:39.652 --> 01:29:41.753
But it doesn't matter. You
shouldn't have your phone on...

01:29:41.755 --> 01:29:43.721
in the middle
of my speech anyway.

01:29:43.723 --> 01:29:45.723
That was just
so disrespectful, Amy.

01:29:45.725 --> 01:29:47.425
God. All right, good-bye.
What? No, Amy.

01:29:47.427 --> 01:29:49.360
What are you
talking about good-bye?

01:29:49.362 --> 01:29:51.595
What? I'm leaving.
We're... We're fighting.

01:29:51.597 --> 01:29:53.898
We're not gonna talk for a while.
That's how this works.

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:57.101
What are you talking about?
No. We're just having a fight.

01:29:57.103 --> 01:29:59.938
What are we doing?
What do you want?

01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:02.373
Why are you with me?
I love you.

01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:04.042
Why do you keep saying that?

01:30:04.044 --> 01:30:06.077
Because I mean it. I love you.
I'm crazy about you.

01:30:06.079 --> 01:30:08.179
What do you want me to say?
We're just having a fight.

01:30:08.181 --> 01:30:10.348
You insulted me, and
that's... And I just...

01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:12.116
We'll talk about it,
and we'll work through it.

01:30:12.118 --> 01:30:14.384
What's wrong with you
that you wanna be with me?

01:30:14.386 --> 01:30:17.121
I... I'm a... I'm a drinker.
I don't care.

01:30:17.123 --> 01:30:20.190
I've been with a lot of guys.
I don't care.

01:30:20.192 --> 01:30:21.524
How many?

01:30:21.526 --> 01:30:23.360
I don't know.

01:30:23.362 --> 01:30:25.395
How many girls
have you slept with?

01:30:25.397 --> 01:30:27.530
I've slept with three women.
Me too.

01:30:27.532 --> 01:30:29.533
I have slept
with three women too.

01:30:30.535 --> 01:30:32.202
How many guys?

01:30:32.204 --> 01:30:34.238
What, like, this year?
This year?

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.806
Fuck this.
I'm not talking about this.

01:30:35.808 --> 01:30:37.240
Don't say "fuck this."
Don't follow me.

01:30:37.242 --> 01:30:38.908
Amy.

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:41.444
I don't want... I'm tired.
I wanna go to sleep.

01:30:41.446 --> 01:30:44.113
You can go to your apartment.
It's nicer than mine.

01:30:44.115 --> 01:30:46.783
No. Look, my parents had a saying.
"Don't go to bed angry."

01:30:46.785 --> 01:30:49.385
We're angry. Let's resolve this.
Okay?

01:30:49.387 --> 01:30:51.921
- Your parents weren't that happy.
- They're very happy.

01:30:51.923 --> 01:30:53.923
Fine. You wanna talk about it?
You wanna get into it?

01:30:53.925 --> 01:30:55.791
Yes, please. Well, let's get
into all of it right now.

01:30:55.793 --> 01:30:57.425
Okay, let's do it. Okay.

01:30:57.427 --> 01:30:59.628
I'll start.
You go down on me too much.

01:30:59.630 --> 01:31:01.930
What? Yeah. It's selfish.

01:31:01.932 --> 01:31:03.933
No, it is actually
selfish because y...

01:31:03.935 --> 01:31:05.768
No, you act...
Don't look like I'm crazy.

01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:09.004
You act like it's for me, but really,
it's just to show how great you are.

01:31:09.006 --> 01:31:10.740
Like, you're
always helping people.

01:31:10.742 --> 01:31:12.508
So I shouldn't go down
on you as much?

01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:15.077
Don't try and spin this as a way
to not go down on me as much.

01:31:15.079 --> 01:31:18.147
That's ridiculous. Of course I want
you to go down on me that much.

01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:20.816
So take it down a notch?
No, keep going down on me.

01:31:20.818 --> 01:31:23.920
Forget this whole part of the
argument, okay? Forget that.

01:31:26.957 --> 01:31:29.878
I'm so glad you apologized.
I didn't apologize.

01:31:31.093 --> 01:31:33.461
Wow. I did not apologize.

01:31:33.463 --> 01:31:35.130
Are you serious right now?

01:31:35.132 --> 01:31:36.931
I've been through
a lot this year,

01:31:36.933 --> 01:31:39.968
and... and of course I'm gonna
have some... some ups and downs.

01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:41.703
But that's why I need to stop...

01:31:41.705 --> 01:31:43.771
and then say, "Am I gonna
just follow the river",

01:31:43.773 --> 01:31:45.372
or am I gonna make
decisions in my li... ".

01:31:45.374 --> 01:31:47.308
You're sleeping!

01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:50.044
You were just asleep.
No, I wasn't.

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:52.614
Okay, good. Because I am not
even close to done. Oh, good.

01:31:52.616 --> 01:31:55.283
I have a lot of thoughts, and I'm
thinking very clearly right now.

01:31:55.285 --> 01:31:58.353
I'm so glad that I feel comfortable
enough with you to talk like this.

01:31:58.355 --> 01:32:00.855
This is the time when you have
to look at yourself and say,

01:32:00.857 --> 01:32:03.057
"Am I living
the best life I could?"

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:04.826
"Am I the best version
of myself...

01:32:04.828 --> 01:32:06.327
that I could possibly be?"

01:32:06.329 --> 01:32:08.062
That's why I need to stop
and then say,

01:32:08.064 --> 01:32:10.398
"Am I gonna just follow
the river, or am I gonna..."

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.333
Wake up, Aaron!

01:32:12.335 --> 01:32:14.568
You're totally sleeping!
Mm-mmm.

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:17.138
You said we're gonna stay up until
we figure it out, like your parents.

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.340
I'm listening.
What did I just say?

01:32:19.342 --> 01:32:21.442
You said, "Wake up."

01:32:34.558 --> 01:32:36.325
Hey. Amar'e.

01:32:36.327 --> 01:32:37.826
What's up, Doc?
How you feeling, buddy?

01:32:37.828 --> 01:32:39.561
Good. You ready to do this?

01:32:39.563 --> 01:32:41.363
Yeah. We're gonna do this.
It's gonna be great.

01:32:41.365 --> 01:32:42.664
Awesome.

01:32:42.666 --> 01:32:45.166
You met Rachel? Yes.
We've been acquainted.

01:32:45.168 --> 01:32:47.035
- All right.
- - Okay.

01:32:47.037 --> 01:32:50.004
- What do we have here?
- Oh, this is just a little more sedative.

01:32:50.006 --> 01:32:51.773
- Hey, the good stuff.
- To relax you.

01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:54.108
- Yeah.
- Okay. Oh, whoa.

01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:56.410
All right, buddy. Okay.

01:32:56.412 --> 01:32:59.247
So, uh, we're gonna be replacing
your cruciate ligament.

01:32:59.249 --> 01:33:03.251
And, um...
Uh, do you want a coffee?

01:33:03.253 --> 01:33:05.787
Hey, could we get a coffee
for... Doc, I can't.

01:33:05.789 --> 01:33:07.455
I'm not supposed to
drink before... Right.

01:33:07.457 --> 01:33:10.058
- Don't worry about it.
- Just one coffee, for me.

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.126
Um... Right, right.
Are you okay, Doc?

01:33:12.128 --> 01:33:14.294
Me? I'm great. I'm great. Yeah.

01:33:14.296 --> 01:33:16.597
Me and Amy got into
a little bit of an argument,

01:33:16.599 --> 01:33:18.966
but, you know, I think I'm doing okay.
Oh, wow.

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:20.600
Yeah, this is
gonna go really well.

01:33:20.602 --> 01:33:22.970
She really lit
into me last night.

01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:23.766
Wow.

01:33:23.792 --> 01:33:26.940
Like, really a side of her
I've never seen before.

01:33:26.942 --> 01:33:29.357
Like, it got... it got...
it got dark, fast.

01:33:29.383 --> 01:33:30.644
It really fucked me up.

01:33:30.646 --> 01:33:33.113
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm good. I'm good.

01:33:33.115 --> 01:33:36.617
We're gonna get this going.
Okay. Perfect.

01:33:36.619 --> 01:33:39.086
I'm gonna mark the knee...

01:33:39.088 --> 01:33:41.122
that, uh, we're gonna
do the surgery on.

01:33:41.124 --> 01:33:43.057
All right?
Doc, this is the wrong knee.

01:33:43.059 --> 01:33:44.725
I'm marking this
as <i> not</i> the knee to do.

01:33:44.727 --> 01:33:48.329
This is not the knee.

01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:49.997
Not this knee.

01:33:51.332 --> 01:33:53.634
Not this knee. Are you
sure you're okay, Doc?

01:33:53.636 --> 01:33:56.003
Amar'e, I'm great.
This is gonna go great.

01:33:56.005 --> 01:33:58.339
This is the bad boy
we're gonna split open.

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:00.574
You know what?
This is a bad idea.

01:34:00.576 --> 01:34:03.310
Amar'e, you're nervous.
Everyone gets nervous.

01:34:03.312 --> 01:34:06.147
I don't think you get it, Doc.
We need to reschedule this.

01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:09.083
We're not doing that. I'm gonna
get you back out on the court.

01:34:09.085 --> 01:34:11.419
We gotta get you back out on the court.
I wanna see you play. Okay?

01:34:11.421 --> 01:34:13.120
I'm here for you, okay?

01:34:13.122 --> 01:34:15.088
You're nervous. I'm nervous.

01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:17.691
Amy was acting
like a psycho last night.

01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:19.426
I don't know what I did.

01:34:19.428 --> 01:34:23.330
I really, really like her.

01:34:23.332 --> 01:34:25.532
But she's like a fucking demon.

01:34:26.767 --> 01:34:29.002
She's like the fucking Exorcist.

01:34:29.004 --> 01:34:32.672
I said, "You gotta let me go to sleep.
I have a surgery."

01:34:32.674 --> 01:34:34.875
- And you know what she said?
- She said... "No!"

01:34:34.877 --> 01:34:36.476
Hey, I'm taking a rain check.

01:34:36.478 --> 01:34:38.319
I'm outta here. No, no, no, no.

01:34:40.482 --> 01:34:42.148
Hey, Amar'e.

01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:43.782
Mr. Stoudemire,
where are you going?

01:34:43.784 --> 01:34:45.851
I gotta get outta here.
I gotta get outta here.

01:34:45.853 --> 01:34:47.786
Okay.

01:34:47.788 --> 01:34:49.554
Amar'e. Watch your head. Wa...

01:34:49.556 --> 01:34:51.289
Oh!

01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:52.891
Oh, shit.

01:34:52.893 --> 01:34:54.859
See if I can help.

01:35:00.832 --> 01:35:02.399
Hey. Hey.

01:35:02.401 --> 01:35:04.635
How'd it go?

01:35:04.637 --> 01:35:07.537
Have you just been watching TV
and smoking pot all day?

01:35:07.539 --> 01:35:12.475
No. I got up and had some cereal.
At some point.

01:35:15.412 --> 01:35:18.181
They, uh, canceled
my surgery today.

01:35:18.183 --> 01:35:22.352
Amar'e didn't feel comfortable with me
performing it because I was too tired.

01:35:22.354 --> 01:35:25.355
So he... fled.

01:35:25.357 --> 01:35:28.758
He was on a lot of anesthesia.
He fell.

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:31.694
And when I tried to help
him, he called me a witch.

01:35:31.696 --> 01:35:33.095
Is he okay?

01:35:34.832 --> 01:35:37.700
You know, and it was because
of all this shit last night.

01:35:37.702 --> 01:35:39.435
Which was... It was crazy.

01:35:39.437 --> 01:35:41.171
It just was bad.

01:35:41.173 --> 01:35:43.173
Yeah.

01:35:44.942 --> 01:35:47.044
You know, I've been
thinking about all that.

01:35:47.046 --> 01:35:49.513
And I was walking over here.

01:35:50.882 --> 01:35:53.417
And I was just
thinking, maybe...

01:35:53.419 --> 01:35:56.086
Can I say something?

01:35:56.088 --> 01:35:58.622
You know what?
It does bother me...

01:35:58.624 --> 01:36:01.891
that you smoke pot
and that you drink a lot.

01:36:01.893 --> 01:36:04.728
And I do care that you slept
with a lot of guys.

01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:08.264
It makes me feel unsafe or something.
Okay, yeah.

01:36:08.266 --> 01:36:10.967
Yeah, you should be with a
girl who you feel safe with.

01:36:10.969 --> 01:36:13.569
That's not what I'm saying.
That's not what I'm saying.

01:36:13.571 --> 01:36:16.472
It's very clear.
That's fine. It's obvious.

01:36:16.474 --> 01:36:18.474
You should be with one
of those cheerleaders.

01:36:18.476 --> 01:36:21.043
Amy, that's not what I'm saying.
Just go be with that kinda girl.

01:36:21.045 --> 01:36:24.313
A little Texan
with huge hair and big tits.

01:36:24.315 --> 01:36:27.483
And then, when you get married, she
wants to be more conservative,

01:36:27.485 --> 01:36:32.454
so she just gets, like, smaller fake tits
put in, but they still look amazing.

01:36:32.456 --> 01:36:34.657
Well, you know, the thing about
cheerleaders is that they...

01:36:34.659 --> 01:36:37.159
you know, they bring people together
and they make people happy.

01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:40.163
Unlike you and your friends
at your magazine...

01:36:40.165 --> 01:36:44.333
who sit there and
judge people from afar...

01:36:44.335 --> 01:36:47.470
because if you don't try,
then you can't fail.

01:36:47.472 --> 01:36:49.338
That's why you're
threatened by cheerleaders.

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:52.642
That's me. You really got me.

01:36:56.512 --> 01:36:58.146
All right. You know what, Amy?

01:36:58.148 --> 01:37:00.414
Um...

01:37:00.416 --> 01:37:02.916
You know what? Uh, we're...

01:37:02.918 --> 01:37:04.852
I have to do the surgery
in two days.

01:37:04.854 --> 01:37:07.187
Let's just take
those two days off.

01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:10.090
And then, um,
I'll do the surgery,

01:37:10.092 --> 01:37:12.192
and then we'll come back
and we'll work this out.

01:37:12.194 --> 01:37:14.260
You know what? I think you're right.
That's good.

01:37:14.262 --> 01:37:16.296
I know we're done here.

01:37:16.298 --> 01:37:18.631
"We're done?"
What are you talking about?

01:37:18.633 --> 01:37:20.966
Amy, that's not what I'm saying.
And you know what? It's fine.

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:22.835
It's not fine.
It's fine that we're done.

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:24.457
Because I don't need to
talk to you anymore.

01:37:24.483 --> 01:37:25.537
Because the interview's over.

01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:27.439
Because your article
got canceled.

01:37:28.974 --> 01:37:31.442
My boss said
you were too boring.

01:37:37.516 --> 01:37:39.837
All right. You win.

01:38:21.759 --> 01:38:23.358
Hey.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.026
Hey.

01:38:25.028 --> 01:38:27.896
How are you doing? So great.

01:38:27.898 --> 01:38:29.764
It's fun, right?
This is the best.

01:38:29.766 --> 01:38:31.732
I love this.

01:38:31.734 --> 01:38:35.903
So, what's... Are you gonna
work at the magazine...

01:38:35.905 --> 01:38:37.771
after the internship?

01:38:37.773 --> 01:38:39.940
Honestly? Yeah.

01:38:39.942 --> 01:38:41.908
Probably not.

01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:44.944
Why? You're so, like, good,
and you have energy.

01:38:44.946 --> 01:38:48.548
Yeah, I know, but being around
all these, like, photographs,

01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:51.752
I think I wanna do photography.

01:38:51.754 --> 01:38:53.920
Oh, yeah.
I can see that for you.

01:38:53.922 --> 01:38:56.555
Like, pictures and...

01:38:56.557 --> 01:38:59.725
I love that stuff, like the
photo shoots for... Yeah.

01:38:59.727 --> 01:39:03.429
Hey! Last call for alcohol!

01:39:03.431 --> 01:39:05.397
I gotta get outta here.

01:39:05.399 --> 01:39:08.098
Oh. You...
You wanna get outta here?

01:39:10.035 --> 01:39:12.602
Yeah, okay. Let's go.

01:39:13.637 --> 01:39:15.639
Yeah, okay.

01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:19.041
Cool.

01:39:25.382 --> 01:39:27.283
Shit, Donald.

01:39:40.599 --> 01:39:43.167
It's so nice to hang with you
outside the office.

01:39:43.169 --> 01:39:45.570
This is great.
I really like you.

01:39:45.572 --> 01:39:47.471
I really like you.

01:39:47.473 --> 01:39:48.872
You're great.

01:39:55.179 --> 01:39:56.879
Mmm.

01:40:04.355 --> 01:40:09.459
Okay, maybe let's next...
next... phase it up, you know?

01:40:09.461 --> 01:40:11.694
Okay. I know
just what you mean.

01:40:12.796 --> 01:40:14.329
Lie down. Whoa.

01:40:14.331 --> 01:40:16.699
Hey. Oh!

01:40:16.701 --> 01:40:19.268
Hey. When did you get here?

01:40:21.372 --> 01:40:23.692
Yeah, let's get that going.

01:40:27.176 --> 01:40:29.344
Oh, shit.

01:40:29.346 --> 01:40:31.112
Shit!

01:40:31.114 --> 01:40:32.813
Yeah. Shit.

01:40:32.815 --> 01:40:35.349
Just feel me. Feel me. Okay.

01:40:35.351 --> 01:40:37.384
Feel me. Okay.

01:40:37.386 --> 01:40:39.453
You like that? Grab my tits.
Grab 'em.

01:40:39.455 --> 01:40:41.955
Feel 'em. I feel like I'm the one
with the tits in the equation,

01:40:41.957 --> 01:40:43.623
but this is cool.

01:40:43.625 --> 01:40:45.292
You wanna lick 'em? Uh... Shit.

01:40:45.294 --> 01:40:48.295
You wanna lick 'em? Yes, you do.
You wanna lick 'em.

01:40:48.297 --> 01:40:50.063
Sure you there? Yeah, I'm
right... Now I'm there.

01:40:50.065 --> 01:40:53.000
Yeah, suckle it.

01:40:53.002 --> 01:40:54.735
Shit.

01:40:54.737 --> 01:40:58.039
I don't have a good angle.

01:40:58.041 --> 01:41:00.474
Let me just... Ooh.

01:41:04.846 --> 01:41:06.213
What?

01:41:06.215 --> 01:41:08.748
You're just gonna stay
really still for me, okay?

01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:11.885
Stay really still. Yeah?
What is that?

01:41:17.726 --> 01:41:19.992
What is that?

01:41:19.994 --> 01:41:23.035
It's Adderall. I have ADHD, so it
just helps me with my education.

01:41:26.733 --> 01:41:29.367
Okay, this is so great,
but what about...

01:41:29.369 --> 01:41:32.069
- Cradle my bonch. Cradle my bonch.
- Your what?

01:41:32.071 --> 01:41:34.539
I'm gonna take a rain check,
but how about...

01:41:34.541 --> 01:41:36.841
You wanna get on top?
You wanna take charge, Daddy?

01:41:36.843 --> 01:41:39.744
You wanna take charge, Daddy? I think
it's... I think it's Mama's turn.

01:41:39.746 --> 01:41:41.746
Yeah. Sure, Daddy.

01:41:41.748 --> 01:41:43.447
Oh, yeah.

01:41:43.449 --> 01:41:45.216
All right, this is great.

01:41:45.218 --> 01:41:48.586
I just want you to know,
my safe word is "pineapple."

01:41:48.588 --> 01:41:51.256
All right. Got it.

01:41:51.258 --> 01:41:54.091
Okay.

01:41:55.093 --> 01:41:57.395
- Hit me.
- Hit you?

01:41:57.397 --> 01:41:59.917
Yeah, I want you to hit me.
Okay.

01:42:01.299 --> 01:42:03.234
- Ooh.
- Are you serious?

01:42:03.236 --> 01:42:05.302
In the face.

01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:08.137
Hit me! I'm hitting you!

01:42:08.139 --> 01:42:09.939
Hit me hard.

01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:12.474
Oh, fucking do it already!

01:42:12.476 --> 01:42:14.075
Hit me! I'm hitting you!

01:42:14.077 --> 01:42:16.244
Why don't you take a little
arthritis medication...

01:42:16.246 --> 01:42:19.080
and then try again.

01:42:19.082 --> 01:42:20.881
You pathetic, childless MILF.

01:42:20.883 --> 01:42:22.416
Hit me like this!

01:42:22.418 --> 01:42:24.551
Ow!

01:42:24.553 --> 01:42:26.619
Fuck!

01:42:26.621 --> 01:42:27.787
Shit! Fuck!

01:42:27.789 --> 01:42:29.655
Pineapple! Pineapple!

01:42:29.657 --> 01:42:31.256
Donny, what's going on
back here?

01:42:31.258 --> 01:42:33.492
Mommy.

01:42:33.494 --> 01:42:35.494
"Mommy"? Mommy, my eye.

01:42:35.496 --> 01:42:37.796
He is 16 years old!

01:42:37.798 --> 01:42:39.164
Fuck!

01:42:41.934 --> 01:42:44.001
So...

01:42:44.003 --> 01:42:46.237
you had quite a night.

01:42:46.239 --> 01:42:48.004
I'm so...

01:42:49.639 --> 01:42:51.340
Amy.

01:42:51.342 --> 01:42:53.842
Listen. We've all been there.

01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:57.078
Oh, yeah.

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:00.641
I once fucked three-quarters
of Pink Floyd.

01:43:01.183 --> 01:43:04.352
Yeah. Dark side
of all their moons.

01:43:05.487 --> 01:43:07.020
Amy.

01:43:08.122 --> 01:43:10.657
You're a very strong writer.

01:43:10.659 --> 01:43:14.099
I will go so far as to say that
you are my most valuable writer.

01:43:16.264 --> 01:43:17.697
Thank you.

01:43:17.699 --> 01:43:21.134
I reread your latest draft
of the Dr. Conners piece,

01:43:21.136 --> 01:43:23.169
and I... I have to confess,
I spoke too soon.

01:43:23.171 --> 01:43:24.770
It is very good.

01:43:24.772 --> 01:43:26.605
Really? It really is.

01:43:26.607 --> 01:43:28.107
Really? Yeah, it's very good.

01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:29.208
Yeah. Thank you.

01:43:29.210 --> 01:43:31.043
You won't regret this, Dianna.

01:43:31.045 --> 01:43:32.778
I know you said, d-don't...

01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:35.515
I won't regret what? I'm
not gonna publish it here.

01:43:35.517 --> 01:43:37.817
Oh, no. No, no.
Amy, you're fired.

01:43:37.819 --> 01:43:39.820
Amy, how could you not get that?

01:43:39.822 --> 01:43:41.855
You are so fired.

01:43:41.857 --> 01:43:46.226
My love, I can't have one of
my employees having sex...

01:43:46.228 --> 01:43:49.195
with someone underage
and beating them up.

01:43:49.197 --> 01:43:51.831
You know? One or the
other, but not the combo.

01:43:51.833 --> 01:43:53.465
See what I'm saying?

01:43:53.467 --> 01:43:55.066
Hey, Dianna, we just, um...

01:43:55.068 --> 01:43:58.203
Oh. Uh, you're doing it now?

01:43:58.205 --> 01:44:00.738
Sorry. Should we come back,
or did it already happen?

01:44:02.373 --> 01:44:04.341
- Everyone knows?
- Did what already happen?

01:44:04.343 --> 01:44:05.975
Amy fucked Donald.

01:44:05.977 --> 01:44:07.743
Amy... I didn't fuck Donald.

01:44:07.745 --> 01:44:09.679
I-I tried... I... Can you two go?

01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:10.980
Yeah, you tried. He's 16.

01:44:10.982 --> 01:44:12.681
Oh, my God!

01:44:12.683 --> 01:44:15.016
Can you get out, you guys?
Go, please.

01:44:15.018 --> 01:44:17.152
His safe word is "pineapple."
Fuck you.

01:44:17.154 --> 01:44:19.020
- Fuck you, Schultz.
- Can you go?

01:44:19.022 --> 01:44:20.654
You wanna line up the winners
you've fucked?

01:44:20.656 --> 01:44:22.657
Get out. Hey, congrats. Nice.

01:44:22.659 --> 01:44:25.593
The girl you fucked while she was
quarantined for we don't even know what.

01:44:25.595 --> 01:44:27.762
I'm sorry about that.
That's so inappropriate.

01:44:27.764 --> 01:44:30.231
Anyway, nice news. I know
you're close with Nikki.

01:44:30.233 --> 01:44:33.114
She got the executive
editor position.

01:44:33.335 --> 01:44:35.235
Oh, that's... that's great.

01:44:35.237 --> 01:44:37.770
Thanks, Amy.
And that means the world.

01:44:37.772 --> 01:44:41.074
Although, you know, I...
I can turn down the position...

01:44:41.076 --> 01:44:43.176
if, you know, you want me to.

01:44:43.178 --> 01:44:45.012
Okay, yeah,
please don't take it.

01:44:45.014 --> 01:44:46.546
I'm serious.

01:44:46.548 --> 01:44:48.480
I'm kidding.

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:52.918
You're funny. Congratulations.

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.686
You scared me.

01:44:58.058 --> 01:45:00.259
No, she's great.
I mean, she's...

01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:02.928
She looks like an idiot.

01:45:07.633 --> 01:45:10.435
Okay. Go. Yeah. Go.

01:46:18.035 --> 01:46:21.271
Amar'e. Hey, buddy. Hey, Doc.

01:46:21.273 --> 01:46:22.939
Hey.

01:46:22.941 --> 01:46:25.274
How'd we do? We did great.

01:46:25.276 --> 01:46:27.644
Okay. You get some sleep.

01:46:27.646 --> 01:46:29.212
Did it go Tom Brady good?

01:46:29.214 --> 01:46:31.280
It went better than Brady good.

01:46:31.282 --> 01:46:33.616
Have you seen his wife, Gisele?
Yeah, I have. Yeah.

01:46:33.618 --> 01:46:35.317
She's hot.

01:46:35.319 --> 01:46:36.885
Look, you're on a lot
of medication right now,

01:46:36.887 --> 01:46:38.954
so why don't you just get
some sleep, all right?

01:46:38.956 --> 01:46:41.122
Isn't she, like,
a Victoria's Secret model?

01:46:41.124 --> 01:46:43.390
You know, I don't know.
I think so, yeah.

01:46:43.392 --> 01:46:46.894
I'm gonna be right here.
I'm gonna be on this floor.

01:46:46.896 --> 01:46:49.897
So if you need anything,
you let me know, okay?

01:46:49.899 --> 01:46:52.300
I follow her on Instagram. Okay.

01:46:52.302 --> 01:46:54.201
You should go to sleep.
Okay, buddy?

01:46:54.203 --> 01:46:55.735
Oh.

01:46:56.803 --> 01:46:58.404
Are we gonna do this again?
Okay.

01:46:58.406 --> 01:47:00.672
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:47:00.674 --> 01:47:02.840
I love you.
Oh, I love you too, man.

01:47:02.842 --> 01:47:04.409
It went great.

01:47:04.411 --> 01:47:06.411
Okay. Okay.

01:47:06.413 --> 01:47:08.112
And he's asleep.

01:47:14.518 --> 01:47:18.188
<i>Everybody's left a dog
in a hot car...</i>

01:47:18.190 --> 01:47:20.925
<i>at some point in their lives.</i>

01:47:20.927 --> 01:47:23.560
<i>I don't think that's true.</i>

01:47:23.562 --> 01:47:25.995
<i>I trust you with my hot doggy.</i>

01:47:34.171 --> 01:47:36.071
Hello. <i>Hey, Aaron.
This is LeBron.</i>

01:47:36.073 --> 01:47:38.073
<i>So I'm at the gym, man.
I think I pulled something.</i>

01:47:38.075 --> 01:47:39.909
You pulled something?
<i>You need to come down.</i>

01:47:39.911 --> 01:47:42.344
Uh... <i>It hurts like a mother.</i>

01:47:42.346 --> 01:47:44.179
Yeah. Hey.
I'll-I'll-I'll be right over.

01:47:44.181 --> 01:47:46.502
<i>Hurry up.</i> Yeah. Just sit tight.
I'll be right over.

01:47:49.285 --> 01:47:50.784
LeBron!

01:47:53.121 --> 01:47:54.754
Hey.

01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:59.025
You okay?

01:47:59.027 --> 01:48:01.527
I'm not okay, Aaron.
I'm concerned about you.

01:48:01.529 --> 01:48:03.897
What, so you're not hurt? No.

01:48:03.899 --> 01:48:05.899
This is your intervention.

01:48:05.901 --> 01:48:09.970
What? My intervention? For what?

01:48:09.972 --> 01:48:11.771
You ruined things with Amy.

01:48:11.773 --> 01:48:13.472
This is about Amy?

01:48:13.474 --> 01:48:15.908
You've been so sad lately.
It's scaring me.

01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:17.809
- Oh.
- Aaron.

01:48:17.811 --> 01:48:19.477
We're concerned about you.

01:48:19.479 --> 01:48:21.246
You've helped us, and now
we're gonna help you.

01:48:21.248 --> 01:48:23.768
- Come on, man.
- Sit. Sit down.

01:48:24.982 --> 01:48:29.385
Oh, it started and it is on.

01:48:29.387 --> 01:48:32.054
I'm sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

01:48:32.056 --> 01:48:35.391
Now, I know that relationships
can be terrifying,

01:48:35.393 --> 01:48:38.093
but you don't just bail out
at the first sign of trouble.

01:48:38.095 --> 01:48:41.330
Oh, it's obvious. Aaron choking
under intense pressure.

01:48:41.332 --> 01:48:43.231
I did not choke, Marv.

01:48:43.233 --> 01:48:46.235
You know what? Thanks for that,
Matthew, but you live a charmed life.

01:48:46.237 --> 01:48:48.237
Okay? My situation
is much more complicated.

01:48:48.239 --> 01:48:50.606
You know, not all of us
can be Ferris Bueller...

01:48:50.608 --> 01:48:52.642
and marry the star
of <i> Sex and the City.</i>

01:48:52.644 --> 01:48:54.910
Why not? I did.

01:48:54.912 --> 01:48:58.314
Yeah.<i> You did.</i> You married the
star of <i> Sex and the City.</i>

01:48:58.316 --> 01:49:01.583
- There's three other ladies on that show.
- Yeah, one's a lesbian.

01:49:01.585 --> 01:49:04.253
Now... Matthew,
that's not helpful.

01:49:04.255 --> 01:49:05.854
We want him to stay with Amy.

01:49:05.856 --> 01:49:09.024
Look, if he's not happy and she's
not the right one for him,

01:49:09.026 --> 01:49:11.659
then obviously,
it's just not meant to be.

01:49:11.661 --> 01:49:16.164
Sometimes, the right person happens
to be sitting right in front of you.

01:49:16.166 --> 01:49:19.267
Chris Evert hitting
on Aaron hard.

01:49:19.269 --> 01:49:20.668
Chris, don't hit on Aaron.

01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:22.837
LeBron, don't be a cockblocker.

01:49:22.839 --> 01:49:27.108
Evert is still at it, and, frankly,
it's making me uncomfortable.

01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:29.610
You know what
I think the issue might be?

01:49:29.612 --> 01:49:31.812
You're probably
focusing on her problems...

01:49:31.814 --> 01:49:33.314
instead of looking
in the mirror.

01:49:33.316 --> 01:49:36.517
- Aaron is playing the blame game.
- Thank you, Marv.

01:49:36.519 --> 01:49:39.187
I bet you're not the easiest person
to have a relationship with.

01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:42.857
Broderick cutting deep with his insights.
He is on fire.

01:49:42.859 --> 01:49:44.826
His best work since <i> WarGames.</i>

01:49:44.828 --> 01:49:48.229
You guys don't understand. I tried.
She didn't wanna be a part of it.

01:49:48.231 --> 01:49:50.731
Can't just run when you get scared.
She pushed me away.

01:49:50.733 --> 01:49:53.468
Aaron is fearing
engulfment and intimacy.

01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:55.136
Okay, you know what?
You're not helpful.

01:49:55.138 --> 01:49:57.372
You're not helpful.
You're not helpful.

01:49:57.374 --> 01:50:00.241
And you are really not helpful, Marv.
Really not helpful.

01:50:00.243 --> 01:50:02.476
Marv Albert apologizes.

01:50:02.478 --> 01:50:04.812
All right. Wait a minute.
No, wait, wait, Aaron.

01:50:04.814 --> 01:50:08.549
Before you go, can you
take a look at my hip?

01:50:08.551 --> 01:50:09.261
Are you serious?

01:50:09.287 --> 01:50:11.653
There's a popping sound,
and it doesn't go away.

01:50:11.655 --> 01:50:14.555
Yeah, when I walk.
Any time I walk.

01:50:14.557 --> 01:50:16.391
I can hear it. I'll see you
at the office, all right?

01:50:16.393 --> 01:50:17.725
- Bye.
- Aaron.

01:50:17.727 --> 01:50:19.993
Good-bye, LeBron. Aaron!

01:50:19.995 --> 01:50:22.429
I thought you said he
would look at my hip.

01:50:22.431 --> 01:50:24.430
Yeah, if things
would've went better.

01:50:40.849 --> 01:50:42.850
Hi.

01:50:42.852 --> 01:50:44.317
Hey.

01:50:47.188 --> 01:50:49.455
This isn't working
for you anymore.

01:50:51.225 --> 01:50:52.692
I know.

01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.293
I'm sorry.

01:50:56.863 --> 01:50:59.030
I know you're sorry.

01:50:59.032 --> 01:51:00.264
No.

01:51:00.266 --> 01:51:03.133
No, I'm really sorry.

01:51:05.035 --> 01:51:06.935
I want you to know...

01:51:06.937 --> 01:51:11.040
that I act like...

01:51:11.042 --> 01:51:15.411
everything you do in your life
is so wrong and stupid.

01:51:15.413 --> 01:51:19.347
But it's just because I... I don't
think that I can have that.

01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:23.151
I'm not okay.

01:51:24.453 --> 01:51:25.886
I'm not okay, Kimmy.

01:51:27.222 --> 01:51:29.489
I know what I am.

01:51:29.491 --> 01:51:32.224
I know who I am and I'm...

01:51:33.961 --> 01:51:37.229
I'm broken.

01:51:37.231 --> 01:51:40.399
Mother, Dad needs you.

01:51:40.401 --> 01:51:42.267
We're talking right now.
What's going on?

01:51:42.269 --> 01:51:44.402
I don't know.
He's just yelling.

01:51:44.404 --> 01:51:45.937
Okay.

01:51:45.939 --> 01:51:48.180
Is it okay? Okay.

01:51:58.318 --> 01:52:00.252
What you got there?

01:52:00.254 --> 01:52:03.022
Uh, my drawings for Minecraft.

01:52:05.158 --> 01:52:07.459
For what? Minecraft.

01:52:07.461 --> 01:52:11.763
It's a game where you can build
a whole virtual world...

01:52:11.765 --> 01:52:13.765
and put whatever
you want in it...

01:52:13.767 --> 01:52:18.637
and make it big
or small or whatever.

01:52:18.639 --> 01:52:21.107
Let me see. Yeah.

01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:23.442
If it's a video game,
why is it in a notebook?

01:52:23.444 --> 01:52:25.977
Oh, I... I draw it out first,
you know, to plan it...

01:52:25.979 --> 01:52:30.047
so I know what to build
and what to put in it...

01:52:30.049 --> 01:52:32.382
instead of just winging it.

01:52:34.686 --> 01:52:37.354
What's this?
Oh, this is our house.

01:52:37.356 --> 01:52:40.991
Here's my bedroom.
Here's the baby's room.

01:52:40.993 --> 01:52:43.059
What's that rectangle?

01:52:43.061 --> 01:52:46.229
It's the mattress for you and Aaron
to stay in once the baby's born.

01:52:49.132 --> 01:52:50.900
That's for me?

01:52:50.902 --> 01:52:53.903
You and Aaron. Yeah. Yeah.

01:52:53.905 --> 01:52:57.040
That's really cool, Allister.
Thank you.

01:52:57.042 --> 01:53:00.009
But you know what? I don't think
Aaron's gonna be around much anymore.

01:53:00.011 --> 01:53:01.844
So...

01:53:01.846 --> 01:53:04.580
Oh. You don't like him anymore.

01:53:06.049 --> 01:53:09.819
I like him more than anybody.
He's my best friend.

01:53:09.821 --> 01:53:11.461
Then we should
have him come over.

01:53:16.726 --> 01:53:19.427
Yeah. Yeah.

01:53:19.429 --> 01:53:21.596
We should.

01:53:23.765 --> 01:53:26.768
The baby's room is pink.

01:53:26.770 --> 01:53:29.003
It's a girl?

01:53:29.938 --> 01:53:31.939
It's a girl.

01:53:31.941 --> 01:53:35.610
That is... That's amazing.
Congrats.

01:53:35.612 --> 01:53:37.678
That's so cool. No, it's not.

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:40.081
It's not. It's the worst
thing in the world.

01:53:40.083 --> 01:53:42.416
It really sucks. She's doomed.

01:53:42.418 --> 01:53:44.184
No, she'll be fine.

01:53:44.186 --> 01:53:46.453
She's got us.

01:53:46.455 --> 01:53:48.188
She'll be fine.

01:53:48.190 --> 01:53:50.123
I miss Dad too.

01:53:50.125 --> 01:53:52.259
I know that.

01:53:52.261 --> 01:53:54.461
Come here.

01:53:55.963 --> 01:53:57.464
I got you.

01:53:58.933 --> 01:54:02.903
I'm uncomfortable.

01:54:02.905 --> 01:54:04.471
We're together.

01:54:04.473 --> 01:54:06.473
Receive... The love.

01:54:06.475 --> 01:54:09.076
Get outta here.

01:54:09.078 --> 01:54:12.079
Too much intimacy.
Love overload.

01:54:12.081 --> 01:54:14.441
Accept it.
I'm exiting this hug.

01:54:27.263 --> 01:54:28.997
Urban Outfitter, help me out.
Come on, buddy.

01:54:28.999 --> 01:54:31.099
Hey, Noam. What's up, Amy?

01:54:31.101 --> 01:54:33.802
- A gift.
- Booze, pot, drugs.

01:54:33.804 --> 01:54:38.273
And a place to live.
Amy, you are the best.

01:54:38.275 --> 01:54:40.342
You got it, man. Oh, God. I
gotta give you something.

01:54:40.344 --> 01:54:42.143
No, it's okay. How
about a reach around?

01:54:42.145 --> 01:54:44.178
Oh, I don't need a reach around.
Thanks, man.

01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:48.482
"The most important play of the
season is about to take place..."

01:54:48.484 --> 01:54:51.486
and there isn't a scoreboard,
fan or cheerleader in sight.

01:54:51.488 --> 01:54:54.755
<i>The man on the spot
is Aaron Conners.</i>

01:54:54.757 --> 01:54:59.459
<i>And his arena is a silent, antiseptic
operating room on a Tuesday morning...</i>

01:54:59.461 --> 01:55:03.830
<i>where he's about to sew Amar'e Stoudemire's
battered $20 million knee together.</i>

01:55:04.832 --> 01:55:06.499
<i>Time is ticking.</i>

01:55:06.501 --> 01:55:09.603
<i>Pressure builds,
and he goes for it.</i>

01:55:09.605 --> 01:55:11.438
<i>I, on the other hand,
just woke up,</i>

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:13.873
<i>still drunk with dried cheese
under my fingernails,</i>

01:55:13.875 --> 01:55:15.976
<i>leading me to believe
that I ordered fries...</i>

01:55:15.978 --> 01:55:17.610
<i>before passing out
on the floor.</i>

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:20.846
<i>Life hurts.</i>

01:55:20.848 --> 01:55:24.316
<i>But spending time with Dr. Conners
showed me that you can't play scared.</i>

01:55:24.318 --> 01:55:28.787
<i>And maybe every drunken night, accidental
ride on the Staten Island Ferry...</i>

01:55:28.789 --> 01:55:32.023
<i>and awkward sexual encounter
were just practice for this.</i>

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:33.759
<i>"The main event."</i>

01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:39.498
<i>Since the beginning
of training camp,</i>

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:43.068
<i>Knick fans have wondered, when do
they get back their number one?</i>

01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:45.171
<i>Well, the answer is tonight.</i>

01:55:45.173 --> 01:55:49.174
<i>Amar'e Stoudemire is back
in action for the Knicks.</i>

01:55:56.182 --> 01:56:00.485
<i>Hi, everybody. I'm Marv Albert, and welcome
to sold-out Madison Square Garden,</i>

01:56:00.487 --> 01:56:02.688
<i>where Knicks fans
are holding their breath...</i>

01:56:02.690 --> 01:56:07.024
<i>to see if Amar'e Stoudemire's surgically
repaired knee will bring new hope...</i>

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:09.360
<i>as they tip off another season,</i>

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:12.696
<i>looking to get back
into the play-off picture.</i>

01:56:12.698 --> 01:56:16.834
<i>It's the Knicks and the Nets,
coming up next.</i>

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:18.602
How you doing, man?

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:20.605
I'm gonna ask you this question.
How are you feeling?

01:56:20.607 --> 01:56:22.373
How's the knee feeling? Feels good.
Feels great.

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:23.907
Yeah. It's okay? Yeah.
It's awesome.

01:56:23.909 --> 01:56:25.441
Taxi!

01:56:28.045 --> 01:56:31.347
Oh, taxi! What is going on?

01:56:31.349 --> 01:56:33.917
Amar'e Stoudemire
is checking in.

01:56:33.919 --> 01:56:37.287
And it is a standing ovation.

01:56:40.725 --> 01:56:45.296
<i>Number one, Amar'e Stoudemire!</i>

01:57:05.052 --> 01:57:07.286
Why are we stopped?

01:57:07.288 --> 01:57:09.455
You know, sometimes
on these short trains,

01:57:09.457 --> 01:57:11.757
you know, it doesn't touch
that third rail,

01:57:11.759 --> 01:57:13.425
you know, where
the electricity is?

01:57:13.427 --> 01:57:16.128
So the red signal comes on and
the power just shuts off.

01:57:16.130 --> 01:57:18.763
Really? No, not really.
I don't fucking know.

01:57:18.765 --> 01:57:21.133
Do I look like I work for MTA?
I don't know.

01:57:21.135 --> 01:57:23.802
What, I got MetroCards in my
fucking purse now? Oh. Sorry.

01:57:23.804 --> 01:57:26.237
What the fuck, man? You
ask me some stupid shit.

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:27.772
I'm sorry. I don't work here.

01:57:27.774 --> 01:57:29.406
Don't lean into me.

01:57:29.408 --> 01:57:31.274
Pierce, off the drive.

01:57:31.276 --> 01:57:33.744
It is blocked by Stoudemire!

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:35.312
And then comes up
with the ball.

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:37.947
Under four to play
here in the first.

01:57:37.949 --> 01:57:40.917
Smith. Finding Stoudemire!

01:57:40.919 --> 01:57:44.186
Beautiful play!
And that gets the crowd going.

01:58:00.472 --> 01:58:03.107
Hey, Dr. Conners. Oh. Hey.

01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:04.942
Amar'e looked good tonight.
Yeah, he did.

01:58:04.944 --> 01:58:06.710
I'm happy for him. Actually,
he's looking for you.

01:58:06.712 --> 01:58:08.345
He said to meet him
out on court.

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:09.446
On court? Yeah.

01:58:09.448 --> 01:58:10.513
Right now? Right now.

01:58:10.515 --> 01:58:11.675
Uh... Okay.

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.651
<i>Y'all ready for this?</i>

01:58:47.686 --> 01:58:48.986
Amy?

01:59:13.111 --> 01:59:14.911
<i>Let's get ridiculous!</i>

01:59:23.552 --> 01:59:24.618
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:59:25.519 --> 01:59:27.721
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

01:59:27.723 --> 01:59:29.856
- <i>Let's get ridiculous!</i>
- You're really good!

02:00:47.468 --> 02:00:48.633
Come here.

02:00:48.635 --> 02:00:50.101
Hey.

02:00:50.103 --> 02:00:52.537
Hi. I'm sorry. No, no, no.
I'm sorry.

02:00:52.539 --> 02:00:55.206
No. You were really,
really good.

02:00:55.208 --> 02:00:58.210
As it turns out, I am in terrible
physical shape. Yeah, I saw that.

02:00:58.212 --> 02:00:59.844
Could you see that? Yeah, yeah.

02:00:59.846 --> 02:01:01.979
I am sweating more than
I am proud of. Yeah.

02:01:01.981 --> 02:01:03.648
No, no. I know. Hey.

02:01:03.650 --> 02:01:05.516
What? I really missed you.

02:01:05.518 --> 02:01:07.184
I missed you.

02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:14.023
What? Amy, you really
don't need to do that.

02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:18.127
Why is there a mat?

02:01:18.129 --> 02:01:19.889
Oh, shit. These guys.

02:01:24.634 --> 02:01:26.402
Hey.

02:01:30.473 --> 02:01:33.954
No, no, no, no. Amy, you can't.
Bad idea!

02:01:36.678 --> 02:01:38.312
Honey! Honey! No!

02:01:38.314 --> 02:01:40.514
No! No!

02:01:40.516 --> 02:01:42.082
Amy! No!

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.026
Amy? Amy?

02:01:52.028 --> 02:01:53.594
Amy. Amy, honey.

02:01:53.596 --> 02:01:55.696
You okay? Did I get it?

02:01:55.698 --> 02:01:57.699
Did you get the basket?
Did it go in?

02:01:57.701 --> 02:01:59.400
Oh, of course not.

02:01:59.402 --> 02:02:01.101
You didn't get enough height.
No?

02:02:01.103 --> 02:02:03.370
No. I thought I got
a lot of height.

02:02:03.372 --> 02:02:06.539
No, no. Zero height.
No height, huh?

02:02:06.541 --> 02:02:08.909
Usually when people hit
trampolines, they go high,

02:02:08.911 --> 02:02:11.011
but for some reason
you went down.

02:02:11.013 --> 02:02:13.279
You went straight down.
Hard. I went down.

02:02:13.281 --> 02:02:15.715
I really wanna impress you.
Yeah?

02:02:15.717 --> 02:02:17.283
Yeah, I wanna show you
I can work hard...

02:02:17.285 --> 02:02:19.685
and put myself
out there, you know?

02:02:19.687 --> 02:02:21.688
No, I got that. And not
be afraid to fail.

02:02:21.690 --> 02:02:23.690
No. I got... I got the metaphor.

02:02:23.692 --> 02:02:25.414
'Cause with the dance, I
wanna show you, like, us.

02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.293
Yeah, I got the metaphor.

02:02:26.295 --> 02:02:28.295
'Cause, like, I really wanna try.
Yeah.

02:02:28.297 --> 02:02:29.863
I wanna try with you.

02:02:31.432 --> 02:02:33.133
I wanna try too.

02:02:33.135 --> 02:02:35.602
I love you.

02:02:35.604 --> 02:02:37.670
Yeah? Yeah.

02:02:38.539 --> 02:02:40.473
I love you too, Amy.

02:02:44.612 --> 02:02:46.212
Aw!
