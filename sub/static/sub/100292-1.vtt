WEBVTT

00:48.720 --> 00:51.400
Are you hungry, Mr. Harker?

00:52.800 --> 00:53.920
No, I'm--

00:54.640 --> 00:56.600
-I'm fine.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.920
-Thank you.
-Then perhaps we can talk.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.280
Uh...

01:03.400 --> 01:04.520
I'm Sister Agatha.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.520
I thought I'd met all the sisters.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.960
I have been sequestered.

01:09.960 --> 01:10.960
In prayer?

01:11.040 --> 01:13.800
In study, Mr. Harker, of you.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.760
I've read your account of your most
interesting stay in Transylvania.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.080
It's the truth.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.400
All of it.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.120
And what a lot of truth there is.

01:23.800 --> 01:28.000
Sister Angela tells me you wrote all day
and all night for a whole week.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.080
Please, sit with me.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.040
-Is the sun a little bright for you?
-No.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.200
Good.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.080
That's good, isn't it?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.200
Ah, my dear, come in.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.080
We are to be observed.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.320
Apparently, I cannot be trusted alone
with a man.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.520
Consider yourself chaperoned.

01:57.480 --> 02:01.440
Mr. Harker, I intend no impertinence,
but why are you still alive?

02:02.640 --> 02:04.840
I fled. I was trapped. I escaped.

02:05.360 --> 02:09.000
-Escaped, yes.
-I fled that place in terror of my life.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.000
He is a monster.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.080
I swear to you.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.640
He is the Devil himself.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.480
Then why have you stopped?

02:18.120 --> 02:19.560
-Stopped what?
-Fleeing.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.600
You've been here nearly a month.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.320
I'm safe with you.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.240
Why?

02:29.240 --> 02:30.560
This is a house of God.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.320
A house of God, is it?

02:33.400 --> 02:34.240
Well, that's good.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.520
We could do with a man about the place,
eh, Sister?

02:38.040 --> 02:40.640
Two years ago,
a church in this town collapsed.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.960
The roof fell on the congregation,
killed everyone as they prayed,

02:44.040 --> 02:45.200
including the children.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.520
The priest was the only survivor.
Priests are like that.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.000
He said to me afterwards
that even in moments like these,

02:52.080 --> 02:54.080
he was able to maintain his faith.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.000
I told him he should have maintained
his roof.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.920
-Look to your own protection, Mr. Harker.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.320
-God doesn't care.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.480
The way you talk,

03:05.560 --> 03:08.160
it's unusual in someone of your calling.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.360
My calling was a very long time ago.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.080
What's wrong?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.840
You have something in your eye.

03:26.760 --> 03:27.600
Is it gone?

03:30.880 --> 03:31.720
Yes.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.120
Your fiancée, Mina,

03:37.080 --> 03:39.840
you mentioned her a lot
when you first arrived. Mina Murray.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.640
Oh, uh, yes.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.800
-I need to contact her.
-You must love her very much.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.160
Of course.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.040
Perhaps, in time,
you will let her read this account.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.360
-If she wishes, yes.
-So, out of kindness,

03:52.440 --> 03:56.160
you've omitted from your writings
anything that would alarm or disturb her?

03:56.240 --> 03:57.520
Well, I didn't want to--

03:57.600 --> 03:59.560
So now you may tell me everything

03:59.640 --> 04:02.320
that occurred in the time you spent
with the Count at his castle.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.960
Your dinners, your conversations,
your intimate moments.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.320
Your life may depend
on your complete honesty.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.480
Do you understand what I'm asking you?

04:15.160 --> 04:16.080
I think so.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.400
I'm asking, Mr. Harker,

04:19.480 --> 04:21.960
if you had sexual intercourse
with Count Dracula.

05:16.920 --> 05:17.800
Mr. Harker.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.560
Mr. Harker, please.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.320
You must take this.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.360
That's very kind of you, thank you.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.040
-I couldn't possibly.
-You must.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.280
-Thank you.
- You will need this.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.400
Driver,

05:34.960 --> 05:38.040
I'm sorry, but we still seem to be
some distance from the castle.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.040
It's as close as we are going.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.840
-The Count will find you here.
-How?

05:46.320 --> 05:47.600
He finds people.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.000
He will send his driver.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.880
<i> My darling Johnny...</i>

06:02.640 --> 06:04.840
<i>You are to travel to a distant land,</i>

06:05.320 --> 06:08.480
<i>and I shall miss you very much</i>
<i>every single day.</i>

06:10.720 --> 06:13.720
<i>It seems to me likely that you will meet</i>
<i>some very exciting women</i>

06:13.800 --> 06:16.200
<i>as you travel across Europe</i>
<i>to Transylvania,</i>

06:16.280 --> 06:20.280
<i>and I wanted to assure you</i>
<i>that, should you fall prey to temptation,</i>

06:20.360 --> 06:24.520
<i>I, as your dutiful fiancée,</i>
<i>will completely understand.</i>

06:26.040 --> 06:28.040
<i>The certainty of our coming wedding</i>

06:28.120 --> 06:30.640
<i>is all the consolation</i>
<i>a young woman could require.</i>

06:31.040 --> 06:33.960
<i>Well, apart from</i>
<i>the very handsome Doctor Holmwood,</i>

06:34.040 --> 06:37.800
<i>your friends Reggie and Barnaby</i>
<i>who always seem so pleased to see me,</i>

06:37.880 --> 06:39.160
<i>lovely Edwin from your office,</i>

06:39.240 --> 06:42.520
<i>the butcher's boy who has filled out</i>
<i>quite deliciously in recent months,</i>

06:42.600 --> 06:44.480
<i>and should I want for variety,</i>

06:44.560 --> 06:46.840
<i>the adorable barmaid</i>
<i>at the Rose and Crown,</i>

06:46.920 --> 06:48.600
<i>who I know you have also admired.</i>

06:52.400 --> 06:54.200
<i>I feel certain we shall be mindful</i>

06:54.280 --> 06:56.680
<i>of each other at all times</i>
<i>during our separation.</i>

06:57.720 --> 07:02.520
<i>All my love and, I hope, all yours,</i>
<i>your adoring Mina.</i>

07:22.040 --> 07:24.520
Actually, driver,
could you help me with my cases?

07:28.360 --> 07:29.240
Hmm.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.640
Charming.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.720
Hello?

08:45.440 --> 08:47.040
Hello?

09:10.520 --> 09:11.680
Anyone at home?

09:15.000 --> 09:15.880
Hello?

09:54.680 --> 09:55.920
I'm sorry. I...

09:56.480 --> 09:58.160
The wine was open, I assumed...

09:58.520 --> 10:01.400
Perhaps I could pour you some, Count?

10:01.840 --> 10:03.200
I do not drink...

10:04.400 --> 10:05.240
wine.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.360
I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.040
I am...

10:12.200 --> 10:13.240
Dracula.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.600
Mmm.

10:34.240 --> 10:40.080
Your employer speaks highly of you,
Mr. Harker.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.320
Yes. The property has been purchased
in your name.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.920
-Everything is in order.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.360
I need only your signature
on a few documents,

10:48.440 --> 10:50.280
and Carfax Abbey will be yours.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.880
I am looking forward to England,
Mr. Harker.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.600
People here, they are so narrow.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.440
I wither among them.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.520
Um...

11:00.600 --> 11:03.040
They are without...

11:03.120 --> 11:05.760
They are without flavor.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.440
Perhaps you mean "character"?

11:10.720 --> 11:11.720
Perhaps.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.240
This is good, Mr. Harker.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.520
You must correct my English at all times.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.640
From you, I shall learn to pass
among your countrymen

11:21.720 --> 11:23.160
as one of their own.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.080
Your English is already excellent, Count.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.880
You flatter me.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.400
No, I don't.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.080
However, I'm afraid
I will be leaving here tomorrow.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.000
I have to return to England immediately.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.480
No.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.720
Sorry?

11:45.800 --> 11:48.880
Your apology is unnecessary.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.080
You are staying.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.640
-It has already been agreed.
-With whom?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.560
Your superiors.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.480
You will remain with me for one month

12:00.560 --> 12:06.040
and assist me with my English
and my understanding of your culture.

12:06.120 --> 12:10.640
-But, Count, I--
-Do not-- No, please.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.400
Do not look so concerned, Mr. Harker.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.080
You are most welcome.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.000
Count...

12:19.080 --> 12:21.440
Count Dracula, I'm a lawyer,

12:22.040 --> 12:23.560
I'm not a teacher.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.320
There will be no need to teach.

12:27.120 --> 12:30.480
Simply remain at my side, and I shall...

12:32.280 --> 12:33.480
absorb you.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.280
That word...

12:41.880 --> 12:44.880
"absorb," he said that?

12:46.000 --> 12:46.920
Yes.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.200
"Absorb."

12:54.720 --> 12:57.920
<i>Please, pay close attention.</i>

13:00.320 --> 13:04.040
You will not find my home
easy to navigate.

13:04.680 --> 13:11.080
It is a rising labyrinth of stairs
and doors and shadows.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.000
Yes, quite remarkable.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.240
-One would almost need a map.
-There is no map of my castle.

13:19.320 --> 13:25.000
No complete design
was ever committed to paper.

13:25.560 --> 13:30.640
It is said many souls are lost
in the tangle of the corridors.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.320
The prison without locks.

13:45.120 --> 13:51.120
Perhaps you have heard of the architect,
Petruvio the Widower?

13:51.920 --> 13:56.920
-No.
-This castle was the widower's final work.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.480
A monument to his lost love
and the sunlight

14:01.560 --> 14:04.680
to which he could never return.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.640
Legend has it

14:07.720 --> 14:09.440
that he died here

14:09.920 --> 14:13.320
in the arms of his wife.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.680
If he was a widower,
surely she died before him.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.880
Hmm.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.160
It must have been a cold embrace.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.600
Do not be impatient
with those sweet little things.

14:46.680 --> 14:50.960
They are man's companion
to the end and beyond.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.200
Where there is flesh,

14:54.160 --> 14:55.720
there are flies.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.400
In the morning,

14:59.480 --> 15:02.400
you will find the sunlight
will be streaming

15:02.800 --> 15:04.720
through this window.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.240
Fortunately the drapes are very thick.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.360
Please excuse the absence of my staff.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.400
They are not here at night.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.680
Forgive me. I am clumsy.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.280
Of course, Count,

15:30.760 --> 15:33.200
though perhaps you could lend me
a replacement.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.240
I am afraid I do not possess such a thing.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.640
-You don't have any mirrors?

15:39.320 --> 15:40.960
Baubles of vanity.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.080
What is the purpose of a mirror?

15:43.440 --> 15:44.400
Hmm?

15:45.080 --> 15:49.560
One will find no enlightenment
in one's own gaze.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.920
-Ow!

16:01.480 --> 16:03.840
Are you all right, Mr. Harker?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.560
Oh, I'm fine. It's, uh...

16:05.640 --> 16:08.520
-just a scratch.
-Please be careful.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.080
We cannot return you in any way damaged

16:12.160 --> 16:14.600
to your beautiful Mina.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.120
It's nothing, it's just--

16:18.240 --> 16:19.400
Did I mention Mina?

16:21.880 --> 16:25.760
I think you spoke of her beauty at dinner.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.600
Oh, I...

16:29.440 --> 16:30.520
don't recall that.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.000
Perhaps it was the wine.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.040
No, I barely drank.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.360
Huh.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.320
My sympathies.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.840
Please, attend to your hand.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.840
It's really fine. It's nothing.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.600
Blood is not nothing.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.240
Blood is lives.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.160
<i>Lives?</i>

16:54.880 --> 16:57.360
You are quite certain he did not say,
"Blood is life"?

16:57.440 --> 17:00.160
-He said, "Blood is lives"?
-He did.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.040
Yes.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.520
It struck me as odd.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.320
But there were other oddnesses
that preoccupied you?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.000
How could he know my thoughts?

17:10.960 --> 17:12.640
I never mentioned Mina at dinner.

17:13.840 --> 17:14.960
I'm certain of it.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.320
A dog can sniff stories
on the slightest breeze,

17:18.400 --> 17:20.000
while we are blind in the wind.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.920
He could smell my thoughts in the air?

17:23.360 --> 17:25.760
No, Mr. Harker, that would be ridiculous.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.440
But perhaps in your blood.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.360
Perhaps stories flow in our veins
if you know how to read them.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.040
Blood is lives.

17:37.760 --> 17:44.360
You will not see me till tomorrow evening.
I have, uh, several appointments.

17:45.400 --> 17:49.600
Till then,
please treat my home as your own.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.680
I bid you good night.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.520
Good night--

18:59.880 --> 19:00.840
Is someone--

19:06.000 --> 19:07.200
Hello?

19:09.600 --> 19:10.480
Hello?

19:21.840 --> 19:24.120
So, there was another guest in the castle?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.920
Perhaps also a prisoner.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.080
I didn't realize I was a prisoner
at the time.

19:32.080 --> 19:32.960
That night, then?

19:33.560 --> 19:35.400
-I slept.
-You dreamed?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.120
I woke early.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.600
No, wait. You dreamed.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.200
After a day of such incident and color,
how could you not?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.120
<i>Was it Mina you dreamed of?</i>

19:50.200 --> 19:51.600
You longed for her.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.040
One longs for the solace of home.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.120
<i>One longs, certainly.</i>

19:59.760 --> 20:01.480
<i>Tell me more about your dream.</i>

20:01.560 --> 20:02.680
It is private.

20:03.840 --> 20:04.920
You ache for her.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.960
<i>You were together in your dream.</i>

20:08.040 --> 20:10.960
I don't see-- This is not--

20:28.840 --> 20:30.920
There is no shame in it.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.000
Dreams are a haven where we sin
without consequence.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.720
Believe me, I know.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.080
Some mornings,
I can hardly look Sister Rosa in the face.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.520
What you asked before, if I'd ever--

20:51.320 --> 20:53.760
If you'd ever had sexual intercourse
with Count Dracula.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.360
Hmm.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.800
Why did you ask that?

20:58.120 --> 21:00.760
Clearly you have been contaminated
with something.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.960
Any contact you've had with Count Dracula,

21:04.040 --> 21:05.760
sexual or otherwise,

21:05.840 --> 21:07.080
is therefore relevant.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.680
Continue.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.640
"Help us."

21:39.520 --> 21:41.880
So, it struck you as strange,
of course.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.880
Well, clearly, there was someone
trapped in the castle.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.480
No. No, the writing. "Help us."

21:49.120 --> 21:50.520
It was upside down.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.560
<i>Yes, of course,</i>
<i>because whoever wrote it</i>

21:52.640 --> 21:54.000
<i>was obliged to hang that way.</i>

21:54.080 --> 21:58.560
But even that extraordinary physical feat
is surely not the point of interest.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.800
Then what is?

21:59.880 --> 22:01.840
What is remarkable, Mr. Harker...

22:02.680 --> 22:06.720
what is convenient
is that the words were in English.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.640
Oh.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.640
I didn't think of that.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.600
Of course not. You are an Englishman:

22:18.000 --> 22:20.400
a combination of presumptions
beyond compare.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.240
Proceed.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.680
<i>I knew I had the day to myself,</i>

22:35.320 --> 22:37.600
<i>so I determined to find the room</i>
<i>above mine</i>

22:37.680 --> 22:40.600
<i>and see if anyone required my assistance.</i>

22:41.800 --> 22:42.680
<i>Tell me.</i>

22:43.960 --> 22:45.000
<i>How did you feel?</i>

22:46.920 --> 22:48.320
<i>Different, older.</i>

22:50.280 --> 22:54.040
<i>But very curious.</i>
<i>At least I knew I was not alone.</i>

22:56.320 --> 22:58.960
<i>The Count hadn't been exaggerating</i>
<i>about his castle.</i>

22:59.360 --> 23:00.280
Hello?

23:03.040 --> 23:04.560
<i>Whatever way I turned,</i>

23:05.160 --> 23:07.360
<i>it never took me where I expected.</i>

23:08.040 --> 23:11.880
<i>Every door I opened led to two more,</i>
<i>and then three.</i>

23:14.760 --> 23:16.120
<i>Every step I took,</i>

23:16.200 --> 23:17.320
<i>I made the wrong choice.</i>

23:19.120 --> 23:22.760
<i>I was lost in the architect's labyrinth.</i>

23:28.320 --> 23:29.960
<i>I wasted most of the day</i>

23:31.160 --> 23:33.920
<i>until I found myself too tired to go on.</i>

23:36.960 --> 23:38.280
-Mmm.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.840
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.440
I think you've been working too hard.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.720
Count.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.960
Please, relax.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.440
Have a glass of wine.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.000
Your voice...

23:54.080 --> 23:55.920
you sound different.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.040
I've been working on my English.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.000
-Ah...
- Do you approve?

24:01.760 --> 24:03.160
It's almost perfect.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.640
The credit is all yours.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.040
Your presence has invigorated me.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.400
Fresh blood.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.240
<i>"Help us."</i>

24:41.960 --> 24:42.960
Hello?

25:01.120 --> 25:02.200
Hello?

25:04.080 --> 25:05.160
Hello? Excuse me?

25:05.720 --> 25:07.720
Please, I intend you no harm.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.080
<i>However fleeting the sight,</i>

25:13.160 --> 25:15.720
<i>surely this was proof</i>
<i>that I wasn't going mad.</i>

25:39.640 --> 25:40.640
Count Dracula?

25:43.920 --> 25:46.160
Are we alone in this castle?

25:46.520 --> 25:47.360
Yes.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.040
Except for the servants, of course.

25:52.840 --> 25:56.240
-I never see any servants.
-They aren't here at nights.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.720
I don't see them in the daytime either.

26:01.680 --> 26:02.800
In fact,

26:03.240 --> 26:04.680
apart from the driver,

26:07.280 --> 26:09.600
I haven't seen anyone working here at all.

26:12.760 --> 26:16.360
Ah, yes, the driver.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.560
What I'm asking is,

26:24.480 --> 26:26.040
aside from yourself,

26:27.320 --> 26:29.760
is there anyone living in this castle?

26:39.520 --> 26:41.640
No, Jonathan,

26:43.440 --> 26:46.560
there's no one <i>living </i>here.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.280
<i>So after sundown each day,</i>

27:05.360 --> 27:07.720
<i>Dracula appeared stronger and younger,</i>

27:08.320 --> 27:10.320
<i>while the opposite was true for you.</i>

27:22.560 --> 27:25.240
Did you understand what was happening
to you?

27:29.320 --> 27:33.120
No, not then.
I thought I was sick, just...

27:34.440 --> 27:35.400
sick.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.560
Turn your head to the side.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.200
Why?

27:41.320 --> 27:42.360
Show me.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.360
You have been very strong, Mr. Harker.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.000
In your circumstances, I don't think
I could have been half so brave.

27:56.080 --> 27:59.080
I wasn't brave. In what way was I brave?

27:59.160 --> 28:00.920
You were trapped in that place.

28:01.000 --> 28:01.920
You were afraid,

28:02.000 --> 28:03.880
and yet you spent your days
searching the castle

28:03.960 --> 28:05.760
because you thought
someone needed your help.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.680
Well, my help had been requested. It...

28:08.400 --> 28:10.560
It would have been difficult
to refuse that.

28:10.640 --> 28:11.720
Difficult?

28:12.600 --> 28:13.680
Unacceptable.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.680
So, your search continued.

28:19.920 --> 28:20.880
Tell us.

28:27.880 --> 28:32.840
<i>My every exploration led me</i>
<i>deeper and deeper into the labyrinth.</i>

28:48.400 --> 28:52.480
<i>Eventually, I made a remarkable discovery.</i>

29:27.040 --> 29:29.080
<i>What had become of these people?</i>

29:30.440 --> 29:31.920
<i>Were they my predecessors?</i>

29:42.800 --> 29:43.640
Oh!

30:06.600 --> 30:07.560
Oh.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.400
<i>Omoara-mă.</i>

30:43.720 --> 30:46.000
<i>Omoara-mă. </i>

30:53.200 --> 30:55.760
<i>Omoara-mă.</i>

31:19.000 --> 31:22.080
<i>Omoara-mă.</i>

32:45.320 --> 32:46.320
It's all I remember.

32:47.480 --> 32:48.960
I fear I may have passed out.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.840
Quite understandable.

32:51.800 --> 32:52.920
<i>"Omoară-ma."</i>

32:53.600 --> 32:54.880
Do you know what that is?

32:56.520 --> 32:57.720
It sounded like a curse.

32:58.320 --> 32:59.440
It's Romanian.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.040
It means "kill me."

33:01.120 --> 33:02.480
They looked dead already.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.440
Dead and walking.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.000
Undead.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.640
Tell me.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.600
There is a contagion,

33:17.680 --> 33:21.680
a corruption passing through this world
from one sufferer to the next.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.080
For those unfortunates
who fall victim to it,

33:24.160 --> 33:26.080
life becomes incurable.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.400
They lose the divine ability to die.

33:30.360 --> 33:33.560
As their bodies rot,
their consciousness persists.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.080
Even as dust, their pain goes on.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.920
It is a secret every gravedigger keeps.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.320
There are those among us

33:43.400 --> 33:46.440
destined to scratch at our coffin lids
for all eternity.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.400
If you work among the dead,
it's not death you fear,

33:55.760 --> 33:57.200
it's the alternative.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.040
Is there any salvation for such creatures?

34:04.720 --> 34:06.920
- I don't know.
-Have faith!

34:07.000 --> 34:09.960
Faith is a sleeping draught
for children and simpletons.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.680
What we must have...

34:13.720 --> 34:14.640
is a plan.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.320
Dracula's one of them, isn't he?

34:19.480 --> 34:20.320
Undead?

34:20.880 --> 34:25.000
Undead, certainly, but from your account,
I think he's much more complicated.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.480
Johnny, there you are.

34:48.200 --> 34:49.600
I thought we'd lost you.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.920
What am I doing here?

34:52.440 --> 34:55.960
Well, I found you downstairs,
asleep on the floor.

34:59.560 --> 35:02.440
I could be wrong,
but I think you were having a nightmare.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.360
You do look rather pale.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.240
You said you didn't drink.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.760
Wine. Now...  ...listen,

35:16.920 --> 35:19.320
I need you to do something.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.920
Now, sit yourself down. There you go.
That's the ticket.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.400
Now, take this.

35:27.280 --> 35:31.000
I need you to write three letters.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.040
What was that?

35:34.120 --> 35:36.000
-That's nothing.
-It sounded like a baby.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.120
No, no, no. There's no baby.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.880
Now, Johnny, concentrate. Three letters.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.480
No one calls me Johnny.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.440
No one?

35:46.280 --> 35:47.120
No one.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.280
Company for you while you work.

35:52.880 --> 35:53.720
Who is she?

35:54.960 --> 35:56.280
Don't you recognize her?

35:57.040 --> 35:58.040
Why would I?

35:59.480 --> 36:03.080
I took it from your room.
It's Mina, your fiancée.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.160
Mina Murray.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.400
How...

36:18.840 --> 36:20.880
How can I not recognize her face?

36:22.040 --> 36:23.680
Well, you do look rather...

36:24.760 --> 36:25.960
drained.

36:26.960 --> 36:27.960
You look young.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.040
And I owe it all to you.

36:34.480 --> 36:35.480
Thanks.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.800
Now, it's almost time for you to go,
so three letters,

36:39.880 --> 36:41.320
all to Mina.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.360
The first saying
you have nearly finished your work here

36:44.440 --> 36:45.960
and will be leaving within the week.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.880
The second saying
that you have now completed your work

36:48.960 --> 36:51.640
and will be leaving the following day.

36:51.720 --> 36:54.040
And the third saying
you have now left the castle

36:54.120 --> 36:56.280
and have arrived safely in--

36:56.360 --> 36:57.880
What shall we say?

36:57.960 --> 36:59.120
Bistritz, hmm?

36:59.880 --> 37:02.280
I will send the letters
at the appropriate times.

37:02.360 --> 37:04.280
I'll forward the last one to Bistritz,

37:04.360 --> 37:06.280
so it can be sent from there.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.600
But why-- Why would I do that?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.920
So that Mina will know
that you're coming home.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.880
But why would I write the letters
in advance?

37:15.960 --> 37:18.200
Because the post here is very erratic.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.400
It's a precaution.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.120
For whom? If...

37:23.400 --> 37:26.720
If something were to happen to me,
and those letters had already been sent--

37:26.800 --> 37:31.160
Then Mina wouldn't think to come looking
for you here.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.760
Do you want her to come here?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.400
That's a baby.

37:43.480 --> 37:47.040
-I can hear it crying.
-There is no baby.

37:48.520 --> 37:51.600
Write the letters
or don't write the letters.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.960
It's up to you.
I'm only thinking about Mina.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.920
Now, if you don't mind, things to do.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.880
See you tomorrow evening.
Leave the letters on the table.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.040
The dates!

38:05.720 --> 38:07.040
The dates for the letters.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.280
How should I date them?

38:10.960 --> 38:11.840
Well, let's see.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.080
Uh...

38:13.640 --> 38:17.400
The 12th for the first.
Uh, for the second, the 19th.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.160
And for the third...

38:19.640 --> 38:21.080
um...

38:23.920 --> 38:26.280
What shall we say? 29th?

38:29.080 --> 38:29.920
29th?

38:30.920 --> 38:32.680
As good a day as any, Johnny.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.680
Good night.

38:43.520 --> 38:47.000
What if I leave?
What if I leave this place right now?

38:47.080 --> 38:48.960
No one is stopping you.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.760
I don't have the strength.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.720
No, I know.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.720
It's not your fault, Johnny.
You mustn't blame yourself.

39:04.800 --> 39:05.640
Please.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.560
Please!

39:11.240 --> 39:12.760
Leave the baby.

39:12.840 --> 39:16.400
Johnny, there is no baby.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.840
<i>I knew in that moment</i>
<i> that I had a choice.</i>

39:24.240 --> 39:28.200
<i>I had been told the span of my life,</i>
<i>the limit of my existence: the 29th.</i>

39:30.520 --> 39:33.000
<i>Now, I could stay here dying</i>
<i>piece by piece</i>

39:33.080 --> 39:36.760
<i>till I found myself nailed</i>
<i>into one of those boxes.</i>

39:40.200 --> 39:41.040
Or?

39:42.760 --> 39:44.840
Or I could kill Count Dracula.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.800
Not an easy task in the circumstances.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.320
No, but I had certain advantages.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.800
I should be fascinated
to know what they were.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.000
I was enfeebled and trapped.

39:58.960 --> 40:02.680
-Well, indeed.
-So, Dracula did not consider me a threat.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.520
That's true, yes.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.480
But on the negative side,
you were enfeebled and trapped.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.320
I had a potential ally,

40:11.880 --> 40:13.800
one who could climb the castle walls.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.360
One you couldn't even find.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.960
That was because I was looking
for the wrong thing.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.200
I should've been looking for a map.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.600
Of the castle? But there wasn't one.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.240
That's what Dracula believed.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.320
But in telling me that,
he'd also told me where to find it.

40:29.400 --> 40:30.360
What did he say?

40:31.680 --> 40:32.600
I told you.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.160
I missed it.

40:36.960 --> 40:37.840
You did.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.280
Then you're much quicker than me.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.280
I'm not quick.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.120
I've always been slow.

40:44.520 --> 40:47.240
But the thing is, when you're slow,
you know you need to pay attention.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.560
It's the clever ones who never listen.

40:51.520 --> 40:54.480
You've read all this already
in my account.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.600
It's vague in certain crucial regards.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.360
Continue, please.

41:04.520 --> 41:08.400
<i>It occurred to me that night</i>
<i>that Dracula said more than he intended.</i>

41:10.520 --> 41:11.920
<i>And more than he knew.</i>

41:16.720 --> 41:19.800
<i>As he was a creature of the night,</i>
<i>I had to wait until morning</i>

41:19.880 --> 41:21.200
<i>to test my theory.</i>

41:30.080 --> 41:31.840
<i>The Count said there was no map,</i>

41:31.920 --> 41:34.040
<i>but Petruvio was an artist,</i>

41:34.360 --> 41:37.000
<i>and artists always wish to be understood.</i>

41:39.360 --> 41:42.960
<i>The castle was a monument</i>
<i>to the architect's lost love</i>

41:43.040 --> 41:45.520
<i>and the sunlight</i>
<i>to which he would never return.</i>

41:47.600 --> 41:48.960
<i>And what else is sunlight,</i>

41:50.040 --> 41:52.560
<i>but the face of one's beloved?</i>

41:54.880 --> 41:56.360
The path to the sunlight.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.600
<i>It was clear from the castle maps</i>

42:13.680 --> 42:16.120
<i>that Petruvio had created,</i>
<i>within his design,</i>

42:16.200 --> 42:18.640
a system of shortcuts through the maze.

42:19.600 --> 42:23.760
Hidden passages,
possibly unknown even to Dracula himself.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.360
<i>How many times had I looked</i>
<i>at that picture and not seen it?</i>

42:50.600 --> 42:53.200
<i>Petruvio's wife was the sunlight,</i>

42:54.920 --> 42:56.800
<i>and he stood guard at the door.</i>

44:33.200 --> 44:35.720
He doesn't know I can get out of the box.

44:35.800 --> 44:36.840
Don't tell him.

44:37.440 --> 44:38.360
I won't.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.560
Are you his friend now?

44:42.360 --> 44:45.920
No, I work for him.

44:46.800 --> 44:49.840
I'm a lawyer from England.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.080
I think he's made you his friend.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.360
Why?

44:57.520 --> 44:58.880
What's England?

44:59.400 --> 45:01.040
It's where I'm from.

45:02.080 --> 45:05.800
You know it. Your speaking English.

45:06.560 --> 45:07.640
I learned it.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.320
-How?
-It tasted funny.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.200
Tasted?

45:14.640 --> 45:18.080
Once you are the Count's friend,
all languages are the same.

45:21.680 --> 45:22.720
I'm hungry.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.160
Was it you at the window?

45:26.760 --> 45:29.160
You left the message?

45:29.880 --> 45:31.360
I smelled you.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.720
You're trapped here.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.040
You're trapped too.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.400
I want to help you.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.600
Tell him I'm hungry.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.640
He only gives me scraps.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.720
Tiny little things.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.120
Tell him I finished the last one.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.240
I finished it really quickly.

45:51.360 --> 45:52.680
- I'm hungry!

45:55.720 --> 45:56.880
Look at it!

45:58.560 --> 45:59.960
It is the sign of the cross.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.760
The symbol of our Lord.

46:02.840 --> 46:03.760
I know.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.520
It's pretty.

46:16.880 --> 46:20.920
You assumed, I suppose,
that the cross would ward off evil.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.160
Why are you smiling?

46:26.160 --> 46:29.040
Your faith, I think it's touching.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.440
What happened to yours?

46:31.560 --> 46:34.680
I have looked for God everywhere
in this world and never found him.

46:36.280 --> 46:37.400
Then why are you here?

46:37.480 --> 46:40.520
Well, like many women of my age,
I am trapped in a loveless marriage,

46:40.600 --> 46:43.200
maintaining appearances
for the sake of a roof over my head.

46:44.720 --> 46:45.760
Now then,

46:45.840 --> 46:49.200
we proceed to your miraculous escape
from Castle Dracula

46:49.280 --> 46:51.560
about which you have been so vague.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.200
Somebody?

47:25.280 --> 47:26.920
Please, help!

48:12.040 --> 48:14.120
Johnny, this is interesting.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.920
I've never seen it work
with a baby before. Never.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.920
I think I might keep it on for a while.

48:21.560 --> 48:24.760
I hope this doesn't mean
that I'm getting sentimental.

48:30.680 --> 48:32.920
- Why did you kill her?
- Who?

48:33.880 --> 48:35.240
Oh, um...

48:35.320 --> 48:38.080
because I wanted to see if she would die,
I suppose.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.480
Johnny, don't give me that look.

48:41.560 --> 48:43.800
You were a child once.
You know the feeling.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.200
Didn't you break your toys apart
to see how they worked?

48:46.960 --> 48:48.400
You are a monster.

48:48.480 --> 48:50.760
And you are a lawyer. Nobody's perfect.

48:51.800 --> 48:52.640
Ah.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.480
A stake through the heart.

48:54.560 --> 48:57.960
You see, sometimes the legends are right.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.080
This is not one
you can test too often, though.

49:01.760 --> 49:04.040
I only ever have three brides at a time.

49:05.080 --> 49:05.920
Brides?

49:06.000 --> 49:08.840
Brides, yes.
I think that's the right word for it.

49:08.920 --> 49:10.400
You see, um...

49:10.480 --> 49:13.040
I am trying to reproduce.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.120
-Ooh.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.720
Which, frankly,
can be a bit of a challenge

49:17.800 --> 49:19.400
when there is only one of you.

49:21.560 --> 49:25.360
Ah, Johnny, you're just about done,
aren't you?

49:25.440 --> 49:26.880
She was a thirsty little thing,

49:26.960 --> 49:30.880
and to think that she was going to
keep you in that box all to herself.

49:31.280 --> 49:32.400
Are you going to kill me?

49:32.480 --> 49:35.080
Of course I'm going to kill you.

49:37.280 --> 49:41.040
Why does death always come
as such a shock to mortals?

49:50.160 --> 49:52.680
You took everything from me.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.360
Well, of course I did.

49:55.440 --> 49:58.800
You are the high road
that leads me to England.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.840
Why England?

50:01.320 --> 50:02.400
Ah.

50:04.600 --> 50:05.520
The people.

50:05.600 --> 50:09.440
All those sophisticated
and intelligent people.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.120
As I've been trying to tell everyone
for centuries,

50:13.200 --> 50:14.880
you are what you eat.

50:35.920 --> 50:36.800
Now...

50:39.960 --> 50:44.080
if you don't mind,
I need you to do one last thing for me.

50:45.360 --> 50:48.160
I haven't seen her in hundreds of years.

50:48.640 --> 50:50.120
Describe her to me.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.720
Who?

50:51.800 --> 50:55.160
I've had artists paint her
and poets capture her in words,

50:55.240 --> 50:59.840
and Mozart wrote
such a pretty little tune, I...

51:00.360 --> 51:02.720
I really should have spared him, but...

51:04.280 --> 51:05.680
What does a lawyer see?

51:06.640 --> 51:08.200
Johnny, in my memory,

51:08.280 --> 51:11.880
she sits behind the second highest peak
at this time of year,

51:11.960 --> 51:13.200
and she's quite red.

51:15.520 --> 51:16.680
Is she red, Johnny?

51:19.120 --> 51:20.280
Look for yourself.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.760
But that will burn me to dust.

51:28.600 --> 51:29.480
Good.

51:30.320 --> 51:31.280
Fair enough.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.880
Absolutely fair enough.

51:34.640 --> 51:36.400
Will you put me in a box?

51:36.840 --> 51:39.000
Keep your eyes on the sun, Johnny.

51:39.640 --> 51:41.560
It'll be the last time you see her.

51:42.840 --> 51:46.560
There is a box waiting for you
in case you walk, yes.

51:46.640 --> 51:50.720
But most people I feed off just die,
so you'll probably be fine.

51:52.560 --> 51:54.680
Don't you see? An end is a blessing.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.440
Dying gives you size.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.040
It's the mountaintop

51:59.120 --> 52:01.560
from which your whole life
is at last visible,

52:02.520 --> 52:03.680
from beginning to end.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.240
Death completes you.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.600
Spare me.

52:09.680 --> 52:10.880
How?

52:12.480 --> 52:14.880
Answer me. Johnny, how?

52:15.960 --> 52:17.400
How do I spare you?

52:19.000 --> 52:20.760
How indeed, Mr. Harker?

52:22.400 --> 52:23.480
Mr. Harker.

52:24.600 --> 52:25.800
Mr. Harker,

52:25.880 --> 52:28.800
you were about to explain
how you escaped from the castle.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.200
Yes.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.400
-You've read my account.
-Yes.

52:37.960 --> 52:40.360
Perhaps it will help
to refresh your memory.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.160
"Dracula will be served."

52:59.240 --> 53:00.240
What is this?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.960
"Dracula is my master.
Dracula will be obeyed. Drac--

53:06.640 --> 53:08.080
Dracula is the beginning and the end.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.640
Dracula is all things.
Dracula is God."

53:10.720 --> 53:11.600
What?

53:12.600 --> 53:14.160
I didn't write this.

53:14.240 --> 53:17.280
When you were first brought here,
you asked for a pen and paper.

53:17.840 --> 53:20.280
You were up all day and all night,
and this is what you wrote.

53:20.360 --> 53:24.200
No. No, I thought I'd--

53:24.280 --> 53:27.160
You thought you'd written
an account of your stay at Castle Dracula.

53:27.560 --> 53:31.120
The only account you've given
is the account you are giving right now.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.680
It's time to finish your story.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.440
<i>Johnny, how?</i>

53:46.160 --> 53:47.800
<i>How do I spare you?</i>

53:48.600 --> 53:49.480
How?

53:51.000 --> 53:51.840
Let me go.

53:52.400 --> 53:55.760
You know why I'm going to England.
You know that I'm going to kill people.

53:55.840 --> 53:56.720
A lot of them.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.680
As many as I need,
and perhaps even more.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.080
I...

54:01.480 --> 54:02.480
I...

54:03.560 --> 54:05.920
- I won't.
-You won't what?

54:06.880 --> 54:09.520
Oh, you won't tell anyone about me,
or try to stop me?

54:10.080 --> 54:12.240
You'll just let me slaughter
all those innocents,

54:12.320 --> 54:14.520
no questions asked?

54:14.600 --> 54:17.520
Some lawyer you turned out to be, Johnny.

54:17.600 --> 54:19.600
I promise.

54:19.680 --> 54:24.080
I swear.

54:25.720 --> 54:26.640
All right, then.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.000
Do that.

54:29.320 --> 54:31.320
What?

54:31.400 --> 54:32.240
Swear.

54:33.640 --> 54:37.880
I'm going to England to destroy everything
and everyone you love,

54:38.840 --> 54:41.760
but if you give me your word
that you won't try to stop me,

54:44.080 --> 54:45.160
I'll spare you.

54:47.080 --> 54:49.440
- It's a trick.
-Give me your word.

54:49.520 --> 54:52.360
No, you're going to kill me anyway.

54:52.440 --> 54:53.640
Look me in the eye...

54:54.160 --> 54:55.320
and give me your word.

55:02.320 --> 55:04.040
Count Dracula,

55:05.680 --> 55:06.920
I give you my word.

55:08.920 --> 55:11.000
If you let me out of this place...

55:12.760 --> 55:15.120
if you let me live,

55:16.400 --> 55:17.400
then I...

55:18.960 --> 55:22.400
then I will do everything in my power
to stop you.

55:26.080 --> 55:27.280
Quite right.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.080
That's my Johnny.

55:32.520 --> 55:33.880
Welcome to the mountaintop.

55:41.800 --> 55:42.840
I'm not breathing.

55:43.160 --> 55:45.680
Sometimes you do,
but I think it's mostly habit.

55:46.040 --> 55:47.560
You have no heartbeat either.

55:50.560 --> 55:51.480
I'm dead.

55:51.960 --> 55:52.880
Undead,

55:53.400 --> 55:55.800
but apparently not yet a vampire.

55:57.920 --> 56:00.360
One must cling on to any good news
that there is.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.120
I do not serve Dracula.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.920
No, but he's in your mind.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.640
The question is,
why are you not in one of his boxes?

56:15.640 --> 56:16.520
I don't know.

56:18.120 --> 56:21.080
It's not something
one ever anticipates asking,

56:21.160 --> 56:23.360
but what happened after you were murdered?

56:37.880 --> 56:41.960
Oh, my goodness, that was quick.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.440
Johnny.

56:47.160 --> 56:48.920
Usually people have a lie-down first.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.360
You're going to be a lively one,
aren't you?

56:57.760 --> 57:01.040
You came back so quickly,
that was impressive.

57:01.120 --> 57:03.720
You even have the beginnings
of a will of your own.

57:04.560 --> 57:08.400
None of the others had much beyond hunger,
but look at you go!

57:10.920 --> 57:13.400
Well, don't you see?

57:13.480 --> 57:15.400
This changes everything.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.200
Stay.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.200
You could be my finest bride.

57:25.680 --> 57:29.080
The others just became beasts,
but you've kept your spirit.

57:30.360 --> 57:31.760
Johnny, you're like me.

57:32.480 --> 57:35.480
I am not like you.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.760
That's everything. That's...

57:53.960 --> 57:55.360
It's all I remember.

57:55.440 --> 57:57.320
But why did he scream?
What did you do?

57:57.400 --> 57:59.280
Nothing. I did nothing. I...

58:00.120 --> 58:00.960
I looked at him,

58:01.040 --> 58:03.000
and the next thing I remember
was that I was here.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.000
Yes, never mind that.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.640
-We know what happened next.
- No, I...

58:06.520 --> 58:08.960
I don't... I don't remember.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.160
The river bore you out to sea,

58:13.240 --> 58:15.520
and a fisherman found you,
caught in their net.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.040
A drowned man walking and talking
arouses a certain amount of curiosity,

58:20.120 --> 58:21.200
and you were brought to me,

58:21.280 --> 58:24.320
babbling of a girl called Mina
whose face you had forgotten

58:24.400 --> 58:26.320
and an evil Count
who had stolen your soul.

58:26.400 --> 58:27.680
Why was I brought to you?

58:29.640 --> 58:32.920
I am known to have some expertise
in the realm of witchcraft and the occult.

58:34.640 --> 58:35.560
You're a nun.

58:36.040 --> 58:39.240
We can discuss
my imperfectly suppressed fascination

58:39.320 --> 58:41.040
with everything dark and evil
another time.

58:41.920 --> 58:45.640
For now,
we will focus on why Dracula screamed.

59:02.520 --> 59:03.760
You were facing the sun.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.880
Yes.

59:07.960 --> 59:12.400
I have sought to find God all my life
and never found a sign of him anywhere.

59:13.880 --> 59:16.240
Why now? Why you? Why him?

59:17.080 --> 59:19.320
-I don't understand.
-Then think!

59:30.680 --> 59:33.120
Count Dracula fears the cross.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.800
He fears the symbol of our Lord.

59:37.520 --> 59:40.280
-The girl didn't.
-Never mind the girl. She was nothing.

59:41.080 --> 59:45.320
Dracula, prince among vampires,
fears the cross.

59:46.600 --> 59:48.400
Do you understand what that means?

59:49.320 --> 59:51.120
No, tell me.

59:53.880 --> 59:54.720
God is real.

59:57.040 --> 1:00:00.320
God is real, and I've found him at last.

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:03.440
You have found the Devil.

1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:07.240
If it takes the Devil to bring me
to my Lord, then I say bring on the Devil!

1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:12.040
-I don't!
- And why not?

1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:14.960
God saved you for a reason,
don't you think?

1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:16.440
I'm not saved.

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:20.160
I'm nothing.

1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:22.600
Would Mina think that?

1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:25.560
If she could see me, yes, she would.

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:30.000
Look at me.

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:35.800
I can't even remember her face.

1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:38.880
Yes, I think you have proven that
to our satisfaction.

1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:47.720
Mr. Harker, I apologize for the deception.

1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:50.840
It was necessary she heard the story
from your own lips.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:09.760
You may have forgotten
your fiancée's face,

1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:17.040
but I have not lost you yet.

1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:23.280
Hello, Johnny.

1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:27.720
Your eyes are still blue, at least.

1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:30.360
Having established your identity,

1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:34.360
it was not difficult to trace you back
to England and find your worried fiancée.

1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:37.080
I have a detective acquaintance in London.

1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:42.360
Mina.

1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:44.040
Did you really think,

1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:46.960
even in your darkest moment,

1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:49.880
that I wouldn't come for you?

1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:55.960
Did you think it was even possible
that I could abandon the man I love?

1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.600
I am no longer that man.

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:03.160
Dearest one,

1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:06.760
we are to be married.

1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:09.640
And so let me be plain,

1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:13.840
who you are will always be my decision.

1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:22.000
Dracula is here.

1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:25.640
How exciting.

1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:35.040
Look after Mina.

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:08.200
Mina.

1:03:09.680 --> 1:03:10.760
Take it, please.

1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:12.960
Why?

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:15.400
Because you're bleeding.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.160
And I can't stand it.

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:22.200
Take it!

1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:40.200
Mother Superior,
on no account invite that creature in.

1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:43.560
That is not a temptation
with which I was struggling.

1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:47.240
What is happening? What is this?

1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:50.480
We are under attack
from the forces of darkness.

1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:54.320
Why would the forces of darkness
wish to attack a convent?

1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:56.920
Perhaps they are sensitive to criticism.

1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:05.920
I know who you are.

1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:07.600
I've studied the legends.

1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:11.840
I am fully aware
that I am addressing Count Dracula.

1:04:15.720 --> 1:04:17.960
The bats are a little noisy.
Would you mind?

1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:32.760
Listen to me.

1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:36.720
You are Jonathan Harker.

1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:39.920
You would never harm me.

1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:47.040
I know I am safe with you.

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:00.520
It's me.

1:05:03.960 --> 1:05:04.920
Look at me.

1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:07.600
See me.

1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:10.960
My blue-eyed Johnny.

1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:21.480
No, Johnny.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:24.120
Don't.

1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.040
Oh, please, don't.

1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:29.760
You don't need to do that.

1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:32.160
I know you don't!

1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:34.280
Johnny!

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:38.680
The sun is down.
You don't need to hide anymore.

1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:42.720
Or are you too afraid to step
from the shadows?

1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:24.480
Please.

1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:37.600
Let me.

1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:41.040
-Johnny.
- Let me.

1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:43.240
-Please.
- Johnny.

1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.040
No.

1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:18.760
I'm sorry.

1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:25.800
-Somebody help! Please!

1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:39.680
This is devilry.

1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:42.200
It's worse than that.

1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:44.560
It <i>is </i>the Devil.

1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:11.440
I don't know about you girls,

1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:14.320
but I do love a bit of fur.

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:26.160
Suffer unto me.

1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:34.720
I'm not sure what legends
you've been reading,

1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:36.960
but bells don't have any effect on me.

1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:38.480
This one will.

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:40.520
Ooh.

1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:43.840
Sister Agatha, have you been up
to one of your secret projects again?

1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:45.040
You'd better hope so.

1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:46.480
This is exciting.

1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.720
This'll be the most nuns I've had
in one sitting.

1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:52.040
Sisters, present arms.

1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:54.520
Ooh!

1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:56.880
I see my arrival was anticipated.

1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:58.520
I was aware of the possibility.

1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:00.520
Sister Agatha,
what have you brought down upon us?

1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:01.680
Cooee!

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:03.560
Hello!

1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:06.360
Hello, ladies!

1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:09.760
I don't want to worry you,

1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:12.600
but the army of the faithful
can't seem to look me in the eye.

1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:15.800
You're naked, and they're nuns.
It isn't your eye they're not looking at.

1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:18.600
Well, isn't anyone going to invite me in?

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:20.600
I've come a long way to see you.

1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:22.080
Certainly not.

1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:24.600
Sister Rosa, the key.

1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:25.840
You can't be serious.

1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:28.080
I am more than serious.
I'm completely confident.

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:29.920
How did you know that I was coming?

1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:33.080
There's a man here
you consider to be your property.

1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:36.520
-My bride.
-He is what drew you here, I think.

1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:39.240
A bee can always find nectar.

1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:41.560
And a trap always needs honey.

1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:43.680
I don't think this is a trap.

1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:46.240
Well, it wouldn't be a very good trap
if you did.

1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:49.240
Thank you, Sister.

1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:57.920
Count Dracula,
please attend my words with care.

1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:09.360
This is Saint Mary's Convent of Budapest,
and you're not welcome here.

1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:13.400
You are most specifically not invited in.

1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:23.720
- Oh!

1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:26.880
So, it's true, then.

1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:29.120
-That's interesting.
- What is?

1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:31.720
A vampire may not enter any abode

1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:34.080
unless invited in.
I wasn't sure about that one.

1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:36.320
-A vampire?
-You unlocked the gate

1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:37.800
and you weren't sure?

1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:40.160
-A vampire?
-Oh, the iron wasn't keeping you out.

1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:42.000
You could have torn it apart
like matchwood.

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:43.800
I could tear you apart.

1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:45.560
Not from out there, you couldn't.

1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:47.600
But what's stopping you?

1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:51.400
A feeling? A force?

1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:53.240
Is it physical or mental?

1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:55.920
-Why do you need an invitation?
-Do you expect me to tell you?

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.440
Oh, I don't even expect you to know.

1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:01.640
A beast can follow rules.
I don't expect it to understand them.

1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:07.040
I am more than a beast.

1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:09.160
In what way?

1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:10.880
But by your own account,

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:12.880
you've been on this earth
for hundreds of years,

1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:15.280
and you can't even walk into a nunnery?

1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:16.960
An ox could do it.

1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:20.240
-How are you more than a beast?
-You want me to show you?

1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:22.760
Of course. I'm waiting.

1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:26.880
Come here, come here a moment.

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:28.360
Come closer.

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:32.120
Look at them.

1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:34.760
Look at your sisters.

1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:37.320
-Armed and ready.
-You're not looking.

1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:38.280
I don't need to.

1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:44.320
One of them. That's all I need.

1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:48.200
If just one of your pretty little army
beckons me in,

1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:52.760
I will tear your world to pieces,

1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:54.640
and I will drink my fill.

1:11:55.080 --> 1:11:58.480
Why would they invite you in?
What do you have to offer?

1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:01.720
-Eternal life.
-Well, they have that already.

1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:03.320
Thanks.

1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:04.640
Starting tonight,

1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:08.600
because the first one to invite me in
stays at my side.

1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:13.120
The others, I will tear apart,
and, ladies,

1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:16.800
I will take my time.

1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:19.600
One should never rush a nun.

1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:21.520
Your words are not welcome here.

1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:25.760
Well, if you find you're not tempted
by my offer,

1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:28.520
ask yourself this:

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:30.760
who is?

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:33.400
Who's weakest?

1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:35.400
Who's the most afraid?

1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:37.160
Who will break first?

1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:40.000
Is there still time for it to be you?

1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:45.080
What's that? What are you doing?

1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:46.880
You wanted to know who's weakest.

1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:49.400
I'm showing you.

1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:09.240
Oh, go on, help yourself.

1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:11.240
There's a dog comes past here most days.

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:13.040
We often give it scraps.

1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:18.400
Go on. You've come so far.

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:20.760
I'm sure you could do with a drink.

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:27.000
Mmm.

1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:31.680
See, I'm not certain I see the appeal...
of blood.

1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:35.280
Each to his own I suppose.

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:41.240
Do you think provoking me is clever?

1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.040
Yes, I do.

1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:47.840
I want to learn about you.

1:13:48.560 --> 1:13:50.920
I want to see the limit
of your capability.

1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:54.960
-It's the point of this experiment.
-You have no conception,

1:13:55.520 --> 1:13:56.920
not the first idea...

1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:02.680
Here, boy.

1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:08.760
This is contemptible.

1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:13.400
-You are without shame.
-Be careful what you say to me.

1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:15.400
Don't speak with your mouth full.

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:19.320
She has earned the right to express
her contempt, you know? We all have.

1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:24.520
Each of these women in front of you
has turned her back on earthly pleasures,

1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:27.240
resisting all forms of temptation.

1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:29.680
We have freed ourselves of appetite

1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:31.640
and, therefore, of fear.

1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:34.880
That is why you can't bear
the sight of this.

1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:39.080
It speaks of the holy virtue
you do not possess.

1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:41.600
It is goodness incarnate.

1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:49.240
For a moment there,
I thought you were clever.

1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:55.160
But no.
No, that's not why I fear the cross.

1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:58.120
Goodness has got nothing to do with it.

1:14:58.200 --> 1:14:59.240
So you say.

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.120
But how can a mere beast understand
its own fear?

1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:06.080
No one will invite you in, Count Dracula.

1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:08.240
We'll just pity you right where you are.

1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:10.680
Who are you?

1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:13.480
Finish your scraps.
It's all you'll be getting tonight.

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:15.880
Agatha.

1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:18.120
That's your name, isn't it?

1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:21.760
Mother Superior used my name.
You heard her.

1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:25.520
-You'll have to do better than that.
-You're from somewhere else, I think.

1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:26.440
Um...

1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:30.480
Holland, right?

1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:34.280
Well, you can tell as much from my accent,
I think. I bid you good night.

1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:39.800
Helsing!

1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:43.960
Van Helsing!

1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:50.440
What is your interest in me,
Agatha Van Helsing?

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:52.960
Who are you?

1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:56.240
Your every nightmare at once.

1:15:56.920 --> 1:15:59.320
An educated woman in a crucifix.

1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:36.000
He was a brave man.

1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:39.160
He must have loved you very much.

1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:40.720
What is he?

1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:44.720
What is Count Dracula?

1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:52.280
In life, he was a prince
of exceptional learning and attainment.

1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:56.400
In death, I suppose you could say
he's the best of the vampires.

1:16:56.480 --> 1:16:59.080
-The best?
-The most successful, I mean.

1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:01.680
Most are feral, half-mad.

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:03.560
They rarely last long, and yet, somehow,

1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:06.200
Dracula has found a way
to retain his human form

1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:09.160
and intellect, more or less intact,
for hundreds of years.

1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:11.720
-By drinking blood.
- Ah, they all drink blood.

1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:14.000
Dracula has learned to do it well.

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:17.400
I think, by choosing his victims
with the greatest of care.

1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:23.040
Even in death, he has retained
the discrimination of an aristocrat.

1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:28.160
And so, he took my Johnny.

1:17:31.920 --> 1:17:35.880
Come, the Mother Superior
will want to lead us in prayer.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:39.400
I don't see the point in praying.

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:41.720
God is nowhere.

1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:47.480
In which case, it is up to us
to stop Count Dracula.

1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:53.840
And we will, won't we?

1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:56.360
Yes, we will.

1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:02.160
Goodbye, Johnny Blue Eyes.

1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:04.880
I shan't ever love anyone else, you know.

1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:07.880
Quite right.

1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:40.960
Johnny.

1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:43.920
Johnny Blue Eyes.

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:47.240
Suicide doesn't work.

1:18:47.320 --> 1:18:49.440
Don't you think the undead
have tried that?

1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:52.920
Stake through the heart, that's fine,

1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:56.280
but someone else needs to put it there.

1:18:57.680 --> 1:18:59.520
I'm willing to give it a try.

1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:02.360
Do you want me to do that?

1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:05.360
Do you want me to kill you properly?

1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:09.160
All you have to do...

1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:13.480
is invite me in.

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:19.920
<i>We face danger.</i>

1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:21.440
<i>We face evil,</i>

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:25.000
<i>which stands</i>
<i>at the gate of our most holy sanctuary.</i>

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:27.800
God is with us, as we know.

1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:30.200
God's love is eternal.

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:32.320
This we know, too.

1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:37.000
Tonight, in our most deadly hour,

1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:40.200
do we think our God will remember us?

1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:45.080
Will he reach down and save us
from death's shadow?

1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:48.280
No.

1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:50.920
No, he will not.

1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:56.080
Where in our world is God to be found?

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:57.400
In our prayer?

1:19:57.960 --> 1:19:58.880
No.

1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:00.760
In our song?

1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:02.280
No.

1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:05.640
In our suffering? In our endurance?

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:06.640
No.

1:20:07.760 --> 1:20:09.760
Faith is not a transaction.

1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:12.680
You do not barter with the infinite.

1:20:13.400 --> 1:20:14.680
You align with it.

1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:19.440
So then, where do we find our God?

1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:22.800
Sisters, I will tell you.

1:20:23.760 --> 1:20:27.160
When you stand in the deepest pit,

1:20:27.720 --> 1:20:30.920
alone, without hope or help,

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.120
and yet still know right from wrong.

1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:37.200
When there is only darkness and despair,

1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:41.080
and yet you feel humming in your blood,

1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:43.400
the difference between good and bad.

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:47.640
When you are beyond rescue,
or reward, or judgment,

1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:52.200
and you still look evil in the face
and say,

1:20:52.280 --> 1:20:56.360
"No. This far, but no further.

1:20:58.440 --> 1:20:59.320
No!"

1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:04.360
Whose voice is that?

1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:07.400
Who's with you in that darkness?

1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:11.280
Whose voice keeps you to the path?

1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:17.040
Darkness and evil may seem compelling
to us all,

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:21.720
and I believe it is because
in their presence,

1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:24.520
we can feel God in our hearts.

1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:30.120
No, he will not reach down to save us.

1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:34.480
We will rise to meet him.

1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:39.800
Let us pray.

1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:54.960
She was clearing her throat.

1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:00.480
I think it's fine now.

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:07.480
So, ladies, who's next?

1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:08.800
Boo!

1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:19.440
It's just that I have a very hard time
deciding who's gonna be--

1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:22.760
Here's an idea.

1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:26.400
Catch.

1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:30.960
This will be the safest spot.

1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:32.680
- What is this place?
-My workshop.

1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:36.920
Here, where the sunlight hits.

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.400
-It's nighttime.
-In the morning.

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:41.720
It's not morning for hours.

1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:42.920
I know.

1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:47.920
Who's got it? Who's caught it?

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.080
Ah, we have a winner!

1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:53.280
-What's that?
-Jesus.

1:22:53.960 --> 1:22:54.880
Jesus?

1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:56.520
Bread.

1:22:57.280 --> 1:22:58.920
Sacramental bread.

1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:05.480
Oh, of course.

1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:11.360
Nuns. You have those things
which work, actually,

1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:14.360
even though you will...

1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:19.480
never guess why.

1:23:22.440 --> 1:23:25.240
So I suppose
I'll just have to control myself,

1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:27.480
but between you and me,

1:23:28.200 --> 1:23:31.400
controlling wolves
is just so much more fun.

1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:38.760
It's a question of who you'd rather have
tear you apart, I suppose.

1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:41.000
You have a choice, of course.

1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:43.600
I'm undead, I'm not unreasonable.

1:23:43.680 --> 1:23:44.960
-Whoa!

1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:47.280
Oh! Ow, that must have hurt.

1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:54.200
Oh.

1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:32.600
It's all right. The screaming has stopped.

1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:37.240
I don't know how you could bear
to listen to that.

1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:39.280
I brought it on them.

1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:42.320
Listening was my punishment.

1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:47.000
Dracula's going to find us, isn't he?

1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:48.520
Of course.

1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:51.480
How is bread going to keep him out?

1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:53.840
-Sacramental bread.
- But how?

1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:54.800
I don't know.

1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:57.040
None of the vampire legends make sense,
and yet,

1:24:57.120 --> 1:24:59.680
somehow, they are proving to be true.

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:02.000
He can't enter a home

1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:04.080
without being invited. Why not?

1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:06.840
The light of the day
would burn him to death.

1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:07.840
Why?

1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:10.800
He's terrified of the cross,
and yet he's no believer.

1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:14.680
Somehow, these facts are all
the same fact.

1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:18.040
There's one thing that Dracula fears
above all.

1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:22.000
And to destroy him, we must discover it.

1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:27.360
He got into the convent.
How did he get in here?

1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:29.160
Well, clearly, there was an invitation.

1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:32.960
Then someone invited him.

1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:36.440
Shh.

1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:54.400
Shh.

1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:02.200
Mina?

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.520
I thought you were...

1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:08.320
I saw you dead.

1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:10.480
I couldn't stop him, Mina.

1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:12.080
I let him inside.

1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:15.760
-He's inside.
-We know, Johnny.

1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:18.360
He killed everyone.

1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:24.000
Do not cross that line.
You can't come any closer.

1:26:24.840 --> 1:26:25.800
Let him in.

1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:27.320
We cannot trust him.

1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:29.120
He is strong, stronger than you think.

1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:31.400
-And if I'm with him--
- No one is strong enough.

1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:32.680
-No one.
-Please!

1:26:32.760 --> 1:26:36.720
-We can't just leave him out there.
-Do not invite him in.

1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:41.480
No!

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:49.440
Come here, Johnny.

1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:51.960
Come to me.

1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:57.920
I... am inviting you to be with me.

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:01.520
You don't know what you're doing.
He let Dracula in. He will do it again!

1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:03.680
He won't. Will you, Johnny?

1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:05.920
'Cause I'm here with you,

1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:08.200
and I will give you strength.

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:11.560
The two of us, together,
we can be stronger.

1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:18.720
Johnny, your eyes...

1:27:20.920 --> 1:27:22.400
He's inside.

1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:25.640
Why aren't your eyes blue anymore?

1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:36.680
They're not my eyes.

1:27:55.920 --> 1:27:56.840
Hello.

1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:02.880
I've been dying to meet you.
