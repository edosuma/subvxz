00:00.934 --> 00:02.925
We have nowhere near
the capabilities

00:03.003 --> 00:04.994
of being able to transport
everyone all the way home.

00:05.071 --> 00:06.060
Why?

00:06.139 --> 00:07.197
We're missing a few
key components.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.764
But we can recreate,
and in some cases, recover,

00:09.843 --> 00:10.832
with your help.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.844
I've been involved in some
very terrible things.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.470
The attack in Coral
Gables on me.

00:14.547 --> 00:17.072
I was manipulated by
a very powerful man.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.242
Who is it?
It was...

00:19.786 --> 00:21.014
What about Samantha?

00:21.087 --> 00:22.179
The people who are
behind this,

00:22.255 --> 00:23.916
they took her just
Iike they took you.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.922
They can't hurt
a little girl, right?

00:25.992 --> 00:27.084
We'll find her, okay?

00:27.160 --> 00:28.957
We weren't aware Thomas
and the sleepers existed

00:29.029 --> 00:30.257
until several days ago.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.229
Or how deeply they've
infiltrated our country.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.129
We have nothing.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.663
Forty-seven years
we were married,

00:39.439 --> 00:42.840
but now when I think
of Roland, all I see
is a sick old man

00:42.942 --> 00:45.911
spitting blood
and breathing
with a tank.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.516
That man's factory
didn't just take my husband,

00:51.584 --> 00:53.575
it took my memories.

00:54.654 --> 00:57.350
And for how many
of those 47 years

00:57.424 --> 01:00.052
was your husband a smoker?

01:01.428 --> 01:05.888
You are aware that smoking
is a significant risk factor
for pulmonary fibrosis.

01:05.965 --> 01:08.627
The fact is, there are
a host of things

01:08.701 --> 01:10.828
that could have caused
your husband's condition,

01:10.937 --> 01:14.065
smoking, genetics,
acid reflux.

01:14.174 --> 01:17.007
He spent half his Iife
breathing toxic dust,

01:17.077 --> 01:20.638
and now you're trying
to tell me my husband
died because of heartburn?

01:20.713 --> 01:25.013
What I'm telling you
is the memories are only
going to get worse

01:25.085 --> 01:27.815
when I argue my case
in front of a jury.

02:19.739 --> 02:22.572

on a midterm.

I tell them that
they're only hurting

our days here really

Fortunately, Thomas has made
a Iot of progress

04:06.279 --> 04:09.442
in creating the infrastructure
we'II need to get
us back home.

04:09.649 --> 04:12.482
And I will be taking over
that effort from now on.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.844

raw materials.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.923

retrieving the components we
salvaged after the crash

that will allow us
to open a portal.

Iooking to you to speak.

Sophia, we all appreciate
the sacrifices

04:57.597 --> 05:01.590
that you and the others have
made. Locked up all those
years.

05:02.769 --> 05:07.570
But Iiving here has had a
profound effect on all of us.

05:08.841 --> 05:11.139

to Iike it.

05:11.210 --> 05:15.306
And the truth is, we don't
want to go home.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.014
I see.

05:23.756 --> 05:26.281
And how widespread
is this feeling?

05:26.359 --> 05:27.348
Very.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.058
The majority of the people
I represent feel that way.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.597
And I think the same is true
for the rest of the

05:33.766 --> 05:37.532
For the first time in a Iong
while, there's a sense of hope
among us.

05:38.071 --> 05:41.097
We are starting families.
We're making a Iife here.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.475
I understand.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.135
I do.

05:45.345 --> 05:49.145
But you know what staying
will ultimately do to the

I give you my word.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.143

Go back and tell your people
that's the decision.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.957

the key module tomorrow.

we can move on
to the next phase.

Thank you.

06:43.102 --> 06:45.070
Did you know this was coming?

06:45.138 --> 06:48.198
I've heard a few comments over
the years about some of us
feeling this way.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.798
A few comments.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.706
I didn't know to what extent,
or else I would have...

06:51.778 --> 06:53.939
You should have known.
It was your job to know.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.681
I was doing what you ordered.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.741
When we got here, these people
couldn't even achieve nuclear
fusion.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.418

to a place

07:01.487 --> 07:03.455

of creating the materials
that we need.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.219
Yes, I appreciate

busy doing other things
as well.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.961
Like what? What are you
talking about?

07:13.032 --> 07:16.160
Well, you told me yourself
that you built a huge
financial empire.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.929
That was all in service
of getting us home.

07:19.572 --> 07:23.064
And there's nothing else that
you want to tell me about
that you've been up to?

07:28.548 --> 07:30.539
You used to do this to me
when I was younger.

07:30.817 --> 07:33.843
Pretending you knew I'd
misbehaved just to see if
I'd confess anything.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.783

weren't followed?

underestimate your mother.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.425

concerned, I'm toeing

08:26.005 --> 08:29.497
After the meeting,
you talked to them.

08:30.042 --> 08:33.307
I had to choose my
words carefully.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.710
Where do you think they stand?

08:38.017 --> 08:40.508
If they knew what we were
planning, they would object.

08:42.554 --> 08:45.649
But it is clear that if we go
through with this,

08:46.492 --> 08:49.655
they will accept you
as their new Ieader.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.236
You will, won't you?

09:04.443 --> 09:06.240

09:10.716 --> 09:13.549

accomplish with you in charge.

What?

09:22.128 --> 09:27.998
This isn't about us. This is
about me, and what I think
is best for our people.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.902
My mother's given
me no choice.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.402
I'II go with her
to unlock the module,

09:35.174 --> 09:37.438

I will kill her.

The doctors say

them a better understanding

under your feet.

13:48.894 --> 13:53.888
In terms of witnesses,
please make sure you
clean up after yourself.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.299
Understood.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.031
Godspeed.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.241
(DOORBELL RINGING)

14:10.482 --> 14:11.471
(KNOCKING)

14:11.650 --> 14:14.619
Shutter just closed.
Someone's home.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.289
We know you're in there.
We're not Ieaving.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.526
What do you want?
Are you Abby Stern's mother?

14:24.096 --> 14:26.860
We're not speaking
to journalists. PIease
just Ieave us alone.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.727
No, no, no. We're
not journalists.
Mrs. Stern, wait!

14:29.001 --> 14:30.332
My Iittle sister
is missing.

14:30.769 --> 14:33.761
And we think it's connected
to what happened
to your daughter.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.873
And ifyou could
just talk to us.

14:38.177 --> 14:41.203
Right now, you're
our only chance
of finding her.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.053
Thank you.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.591
Just one minute.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.331
Abby's resting,
we need to keep
our voices down.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.769
I'm sorry, I didn't
get your names.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.807
I'm Leila Buchanan.
This is Sean.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.672
I'm sorry about your sister,

15:16.782 --> 15:18.977
but I'm not sure how
much I can help you.

15:19.885 --> 15:23.514
We think that the same people
who took your daughter may
have Leila's sister.

15:23.622 --> 15:27.080
So you could start with
telling us what she told
the police.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.816
Abby doesn't
remember anything.

15:29.161 --> 15:32.722
About the people who did this
to her or where they kept her.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.465
The police kept trying.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.928
They finally Iet us take
her home this morning.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.532
She must have told
them something.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.006
She didn't. Nothing. Really.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.610
Could you tell us where
they found her?

15:45.911 --> 15:48.175
At a truck stop in Stillwater.

15:48.814 --> 15:50.941
She said that a driver
gave her a ride there.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.982
But she didn't know
where from.

15:53.252 --> 15:54.947
Maybe if I could
just talk to her.

15:55.754 --> 15:58.154
Maybe she'II remember
something that she forgot
to tell the police.

15:58.223 --> 16:01.283
No. Like I said,
she's resting.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.826
I'm sorry. That's
all there is.

16:05.097 --> 16:07.429
I just didn't want to Ieave
you standing out there

16:07.499 --> 16:09.524
thinking that I could
help you, when I can't.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.436
Mrs. Stern...

16:15.341 --> 16:17.571
You can't know
what it's Iike.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.035
My baby's finally home.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.541
Everything should be fine,

16:26.318 --> 16:27.785
but it's not.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.530
Who are you?

16:42.501 --> 16:44.526
I just wanted to talk
to your daughter

16:44.603 --> 16:45.831
and see if she could
remember...

16:45.904 --> 16:46.893
That's not possible.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.600
Now, how could you Iet
them in here, Mary?

16:48.674 --> 16:49.663
Sir. Sir.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.437
We're just trying to find
a Iittle girl named Samantha.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.568
You need to Ieave.
Okay. Just...

16:52.678 --> 16:53.975
Why won't you help us?

16:54.580 --> 16:56.377
My sister was taken, too.

16:56.548 --> 16:59.142
I said get out.
We're just trying
to find her sister.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.952
We're just trying to get some
information about Samantha,
okay?

17:02.087 --> 17:03.247
Leila?

17:06.458 --> 17:07.925
You're Leila?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.752
You're Samantha's sister.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.554
Yes, yes, you know her?

17:13.632 --> 17:15.098
Abby, sweetie, back
to your bed.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.301
Come on. Go back inside.
You can't do that.

17:18.637 --> 17:19.934
Look, we need to talk to her!

17:20.039 --> 17:22.666
You heard her, she knows
my sister! She just said
her name!

17:22.741 --> 17:24.470
She overheard you talking
to my wife, okay?

17:24.542 --> 17:26.271
Now, I need you to Ieave...
Wait, wait. Hey...

17:26.345 --> 17:27.505
...or I'm calling the police.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.379
Leila...
Sean, you just heard
what she said.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.179
Mary, call 911!
You don't need to do that.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.152
Leila, we don't
have a choice.
We have to go.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.755
Now, okay? Come on.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.722
We're sorry to bother
you, sir.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.124
I'm sorry.

18:06.151 --> 18:08.676
Are you sure your mother
doesn't suspect anything?

18:09.088 --> 18:12.649
If she did, she wouldn't be
going with me, would she?

18:14.159 --> 18:16.252
You gotta stop doubting me.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.924
You gotta stop believing
you're as smart as your
mother.

18:23.001 --> 18:25.060
Because you're not.
Neither of us are.

18:26.905 --> 18:28.372
Get off me.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.774
Get off.

18:41.920 --> 18:46.050
Once she's retrieved
the module and you've done it,

18:47.259 --> 18:49.159
go to elevator number three.

18:49.361 --> 18:52.296
Open the emergency hatch...
Open the emergency hatch,

18:53.265 --> 18:56.632
I'II find the plastic
sheeting and the packing
bag for the body.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.633
We've been over this.

19:00.339 --> 19:01.931
Where's the gun?

19:07.379 --> 19:10.212
I talked with a friend
who knows about these things.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.213
He said to use a.380

19:15.354 --> 19:17.083
for stopping power.

19:17.489 --> 19:21.550
And to use Iow velocity
rounds, so the bullet
doesn't exit,

19:22.127 --> 19:26.120
especially when the shot
is to the head, so there's
no cleanup.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.672
This must be hard.

19:41.813 --> 19:44.577
You being in charge
for all these years,

19:45.717 --> 19:48.584
and me stepping in
and changing all that.

19:50.756 --> 19:53.520
You've handled it a Iot
better than I expected.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.055
Than you expected?

19:56.695 --> 19:58.925
Meaning what?
It was a compliment.

19:59.665 --> 20:02.429
But not really.
What did you mean?

20:03.035 --> 20:06.004
You know how I feel about
how you handled
President Martinez.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.898
The damage
that you did.
I handled it just fine.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.204
In fact, I'm the only reason
why you're sitting here.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.206
Thomas, we could have gotten
out of Inostranka any time,

20:15.514 --> 20:16.742
in any number of ways.

20:16.815 --> 20:20.581
We stayed there because
we were protecting you
and the others.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.819
It wasn't easy,
but we waited.

20:24.256 --> 20:25.518
Because we were strong.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.863
When you were a Iittle
boy, you had this
thing about the rain.

20:36.168 --> 20:40.662
You were terrified
of it, Iike it was
the end of the world.

20:42.774 --> 20:47.711
One day I took you outside
during a storm, and I Iet
us both get drenched.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.738
I thought that ifwe stayed
there Iong enough,

20:50.949 --> 20:53.247
you would see that there
was nothing to be afraid of.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.181
But you just
cried for hours.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.556
I should've brought
you inside.

21:00.158 --> 21:02.820
I should've protected you,
but I was stubborn.

21:05.464 --> 21:08.399
I was trying to force you
to be someone that you're not.

21:11.536 --> 21:13.060
Someone strong.

21:16.341 --> 21:17.968
It was a Iong time ago.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.703
And my point is that
I repeated my mistake.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.578
That I need to accept
you for who you are

21:25.417 --> 21:28.318
and stop putting you
in situations that
you can't handle.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.352
I know this isn't what
you want to hear.

21:34.993 --> 21:36.426
I'm sorry.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.326
I'm sorry, too.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.160
Where is it?

22:21.473 --> 22:22.565
Down.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.929
(BEEPING)

22:50.736 --> 22:53.796
Incorrect code.
Re-enter code.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.363
(BEEPING)

22:57.843 --> 23:00.141
Incorrect code.
Re-enter code.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.411
Is something wrong?

23:05.083 --> 23:06.380
(BEEPING)

23:24.803 --> 23:26.327
Your turn.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.226
It's still viable.

23:58.036 --> 24:01.005
I was worried it might have
been damaged during the crash.

24:10.649 --> 24:11.843
Thomas?

24:16.955 --> 24:18.582
Give me the key.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.456
Now turn around.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.192
Turn around!

24:30.268 --> 24:32.793
No. I want you to Iook
at my face when you pull
the trigger.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.239
You think that's gonna
make it harder for me?

24:36.374 --> 24:37.636
It won't.

24:37.843 --> 24:39.572
You brought this
upon yourself.

24:39.644 --> 24:42.340
Thomas, this isn't you.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.309
You have no idea who I am.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.619
Who I've become.
I do.

24:50.088 --> 24:51.885
I see you so clearly.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.848
This isn't something
that you'd get to
on your own.

24:57.229 --> 25:01.632
You've become irrelevant
to our people. And now to me.

25:02.067 --> 25:03.694
Are those your words?

25:05.103 --> 25:06.502
Or Isabel's?

25:07.539 --> 25:09.006
It's her, isn't it?

25:09.841 --> 25:11.433
I was wondering.

25:12.310 --> 25:15.245
I saw the way that you
Iooked at each other.

25:16.882 --> 25:18.577
You're choosing
her over me.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.409
I'm choosing me.

25:21.586 --> 25:23.315
I'm done Iiving
in your shadow.

25:23.488 --> 25:25.547
I'm done hiding
behind your words,

25:25.657 --> 25:27.454
words I don't even believe in.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.059
Now it's my turn.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.494
It's not.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.459
You're not ready.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.825
You don't have
it in you.

25:38.336 --> 25:39.667
Go ahead.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.698
Prove me wrong.

25:43.074 --> 25:45.440
Show me you have
what it takes.

25:47.312 --> 25:48.472
Do it.

25:52.584 --> 25:53.744
Do it.

26:13.838 --> 26:15.328
(SOBBING)

26:29.220 --> 26:30.619
I Iove you.

26:51.309 --> 26:52.571
Where do you think
they're going?

26:52.911 --> 26:54.572
I don't know, but it Iooks
Iike they're in a hurry.

26:57.015 --> 26:58.710
Do you think we scared them?

26:59.317 --> 27:01.182
Well, we did, but that's
not why they're Ieaving.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.379
Their suitcases were packed
when we got there.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.254
Well, if we ever want
to talk to Abby, we have
to follow them.

27:48.833 --> 27:49.822
He's pulling off.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.470
AII right. This might
be our chance.

27:52.871 --> 27:53.997
Okay.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.330
Wait. Don't turn around.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.862
He's Iooking right at us.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.705
Is she still in the car?
No, they're getting
out right now.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.714
AII right. Here's my chance.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.545
Okay. I'II watch
for the husband.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.381
Okay.

29:06.277 --> 29:07.835
No.
PIease, just hear me out.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.675
You followed us?
I had to.

29:10.014 --> 29:12.073
I have to ask Abby
about my sister.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.141
We are not
talking to you.

29:14.352 --> 29:15.785
Come on, hurry up.
We're Ieaving now,
honey.

29:15.854 --> 29:16.946
No, please, please.
Mrs. Stern.

29:18.523 --> 29:21.924
Can you remember how it felt
when Abby was still missing?

29:24.129 --> 29:25.653
I am desperate.

29:27.198 --> 29:29.996
And if you could just
Iet me talk to her,

29:30.335 --> 29:32.929
maybe she knows
some small detail

29:33.238 --> 29:34.967
that can help me
find my sister.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.568
Just a few questions.
And then I promise
I will Ieave you alone.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.611
It's okay, Mom.
I wanna talk to Leila.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.286
Thank you, Abby.

29:56.294 --> 30:00.731
You can just tell me
anything, anything at all.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.490
Were you with Sammy?

30:05.136 --> 30:07.661
She got there a couple
of days before I ran away.

30:14.946 --> 30:15.970
She was scared.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.378
It's okay.

30:17.448 --> 30:18.710
But she was still normal.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.510
AII the girls are when
they first get there.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.121
And all the other girls,

30:24.823 --> 30:28.850
are they just Iike you?

30:29.694 --> 30:31.059
Some of us.

30:32.230 --> 30:35.063
The nurse there says
we're helping people,

30:36.167 --> 30:39.068
but bad things happened after
she gave us the injections.

30:39.671 --> 30:44.108
Okay, Abby, can you tell
me about the place where
they kept you?

30:44.576 --> 30:49.275
Did you see any pictures
or words on the buildings?

30:50.415 --> 30:52.315
It was Iike a hospital.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.843
But not for
regular people.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.353
Do you remember the name
of the hospital?

30:57.655 --> 31:00.715
Did you see any
signs anywhere?

31:04.562 --> 31:07.497
I saw something
in the trash can once.

31:08.967 --> 31:11.561
There was a triangle
on the medicine.

31:12.437 --> 31:15.338
We told the police, but they
said it was too vague.

31:15.406 --> 31:16.964
It probably didn't
mean anything.

31:17.108 --> 31:21.135
Okay, was there anything else?
Any other detail?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.348
When I got out
of the hospital,

31:25.783 --> 31:27.944
there was a really big tower.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.783
Okay, you mean Iike
a water tower?

31:31.422 --> 31:32.411
Yeah.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.168
Watch out! Watch out!

31:53.978 --> 31:55.070
Behind you!

32:00.084 --> 32:01.244
What's happening?

32:01.552 --> 32:02.541

32:12.130 --> 32:13.529

32:33.584 --> 32:34.573
(CRIES IN PAIN)

32:34.919 --> 32:36.477
What happened?

32:36.554 --> 32:38.181
Let me help you.
Are you okay, Mommy?

32:38.456 --> 32:40.321
Go! Protect Abby.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.723
Take her. Take her.
We'II catch up. Go, go!

32:42.994 --> 32:44.791
Come on. You can do it,

32:52.136 --> 32:54.798
I want my mommy.
It's going to be okay.

33:16.427 --> 33:18.554
Come on. He's coming.
I can't.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.653
Get Abby.
Okay, come on.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.061
Okay, go, go, go!
I'II draw him away.

33:35.446 --> 33:36.879
Mom? Mom!
Abby!

33:37.548 --> 33:38.537
(ABBEY CRYING)

33:38.616 --> 33:39.674
Mom!

33:41.753 --> 33:43.516
Listen, you have to be quiet!

33:51.162 --> 33:52.652
Abby, run!

33:56.601 --> 33:57.829
Come on!

34:00.905 --> 34:02.736
Help! Wait! PIease!

34:07.979 --> 34:09.639
Abby, run, run!

34:45.349 --> 34:46.338
Are you okay?

34:46.650 --> 34:47.913
You?
Yeah.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.284
He's alive.

34:50.955 --> 34:53.788
Too bad.
No. Maybe he can give
us some answers.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.993
Come on, Abby. Let's go!

34:56.960 --> 34:58.553
No, Mrs. Stern!

34:59.564 --> 35:01.794
Abby! It's okay!

35:02.633 --> 35:03.725
Come back!

35:08.372 --> 35:10.272
What is it? It's Abby?

35:11.342 --> 35:15.608
No, it's... I don't think
he was here for Abby.

35:16.581 --> 35:17.946
What are you talking about?

35:26.691 --> 35:28.056
He was here for you.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.458
Ray.

35:42.406 --> 35:43.395
Ah.

35:44.575 --> 35:48.170
Hi. You didn't think you
could get rid of me
that easily, did you?

35:48.579 --> 35:51.139
Ifyou need anything,
Mr. Vice President,
please Iet me know.

35:51.215 --> 35:52.580
Thank you.
Thank you.

35:53.017 --> 35:55.952
Oh, honey!
It's okay. It's all right.
It's okay.

35:57.121 --> 35:59.681
It will be as soon
as I talk to the President.

36:00.224 --> 36:01.555
You can't.

36:02.293 --> 36:03.453
What do you mean?

36:03.694 --> 36:05.184
Someone came
to the house.

36:05.363 --> 36:06.625
Who?
Two men.

36:06.697 --> 36:07.721
What?

36:07.798 --> 36:09.322
They didn't hurt you?
No.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.262
You're okay?
I'm fine.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.163
How are the kids?
Fine.

36:14.672 --> 36:18.938
Raymond, they know our
children's names. They
know where they are.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.902
They said no matter where
we go and what we do,
they'd find us,

36:21.979 --> 36:24.743
and they'II do terrible things
to me and terrible things
to the children...

36:24.815 --> 36:25.804
I'm sorry, Erika.

36:25.883 --> 36:29.080
...in front of you,
and then they'II kill
me and they'II kill you.

36:29.153 --> 36:32.987
I'm sorry. It wasn't supposed
to happen Iike this.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.358
What have you done?

36:41.732 --> 36:43.063
I'm sorry.

36:43.801 --> 36:46.235
Raymond, what have you
done to us?

36:46.370 --> 36:47.359
I'm sorry.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.977
You think about
our children.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.406
I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

37:30.514 --> 37:31.742
Where's Thomas?

37:32.016 --> 37:34.177
You don't need to worry
about Thomas.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.214
You need to worry
about me.

37:39.724 --> 37:41.123
Sophia, I...

37:42.026 --> 37:43.493
I don't know
what you mean.

37:45.029 --> 37:47.862
He told me everything, Isabel.

37:50.635 --> 37:53.160
I wasn't thinking
straight. I was...

37:54.005 --> 37:56.599
I was only doing
what Thomas wanted.

37:56.941 --> 38:00.206
Isabel, you know
that's not true.

38:01.812 --> 38:05.805
I saw it in his eyes,
and now I can see it in yours.

38:07.418 --> 38:08.942
You pushed him.

38:09.854 --> 38:11.845
But you were only giving him
what he wanted.

38:11.922 --> 38:16.484
Someone who would push him
to be more than he truly is.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.459
Of course.

38:18.863 --> 38:20.524
That's why he was
drawn to you.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.626
I'm so sorry.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.832
He's my son, I'II deal
with him as I see fit.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.668
But regrettably,

38:33.411 --> 38:35.811
I can't ignore
your disloyalties.

38:37.281 --> 38:38.908
What do you mean?

38:41.385 --> 38:43.410
Get on your knees, Isabel.

38:43.621 --> 38:44.610
(GUN CLICKS)

38:45.589 --> 38:47.386
Down on your knees.

38:48.092 --> 38:49.559
PIease don't.

38:51.228 --> 38:52.217
PIease.

38:52.863 --> 38:54.990
I'm not going to shoot you.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.193
I'm going to give
you a choice.
Are you Iistening?

38:59.670 --> 39:04.300
I can order that no one has
anything to do with you.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.742
That you have no contact
with any ofyour kind,

39:07.812 --> 39:10.337
not so much as a touch
or a Iook,

39:11.549 --> 39:14.518
that you're ostracized
for the rest of your Iife.

39:15.653 --> 39:19.020
And ultimately,
I know that you can't
survive that way.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.388
Or what?

39:28.933 --> 39:30.594
Give me your hand.

39:36.874 --> 39:41.277
The gun only has one bullet,
so you couldn't be certain
of killing me.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.512
But you can prove
your Ioyalty.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.163
You're forcing me
to maim myself?

40:02.500 --> 40:05.196
I'm not forcing you
to do anything.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.494
I want you to
make the choice.

40:08.506 --> 40:09.871
I can't.

40:11.475 --> 40:12.840
Then don't.

40:13.511 --> 40:14.910
But understand,

40:15.112 --> 40:18.946
that if I can't be certain
of your allegiance, you can't
Iive among us.

40:19.183 --> 40:21.310
Sophia, please...

40:22.353 --> 40:23.684
I'm sorry.

40:24.455 --> 40:26.946
There's nothing more that
I can do for you, Isabel.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.888
The rest Iies in your hands.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.811
(GUNSHOT)
(SCREAMS)

40:59.824 --> 41:02.622
And remember,
this world
isn't yours.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.493
Or Thomas's.

41:05.663 --> 41:06.652
(CRYING)

41:24.682 --> 41:27.276
I know this isn't
easy for you.

41:31.255 --> 41:32.984
We can go now.
