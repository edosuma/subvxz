00:21.108 --> 00:25.634
Hi. My name is Joy.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.331
My parents named me

00:27.375 --> 00:29.681
after the feeling they
had when I was born.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.511
That faded fast.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.041
Peace out, bitches.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.825
I'm good, how are you?

00:42.868 --> 00:44.522
I'm good, how are you?

00:44.566 --> 00:46.089
I love your bangs today.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.917
I have a boyfriend too.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.572
Is that a new baby?
I love your baby.

00:50.615 --> 00:53.575
And then he said, "I
love you."

00:53.618 --> 00:55.707
When I say, "I love you,"

00:55.751 --> 00:58.232
what I really mean is,

00:58.275 --> 01:00.712
"Do you love me?"

01:02.714 --> 01:04.673
These are gonna look
so hot in my coffin.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.376
I actually wasn't
always this miserable.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.118
One time, in seventh-grade band,

01:15.162 --> 01:18.513
I challenged Bobby Hendricks
on the drums for first chair.

01:18.556 --> 01:22.125
I fucking won.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.258
That was the moment I peaked.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.915
Mmm.

01:35.617 --> 01:38.533
You know that huge,
gaping hole in your soul?

01:38.576 --> 01:41.144
Lots of people find
ways to fill it up...

01:41.188 --> 01:44.713
Drugs, booze, porn,
food, gambling, shopping.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.933
I've had my own ways.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.283
This is Rob.

01:49.326 --> 01:50.501
This is Greg.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.329
This is Enrique.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.376
But it's never enough.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.728
I always need more.

01:59.771 --> 02:00.729
You're the one.

02:00.772 --> 02:01.773
You're the one.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.210
You're the one!

02:06.604 --> 02:08.389
Ooh... Oh, boy.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.182
I'm a piece of shit.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.709
I can't do anything right.

02:31.194 --> 02:34.197
I couldn't even get
killing myself right.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.894
This monkey is an orphan,

02:35.938 --> 02:39.942
separated from his mother
since the day of his birth.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.906
A soft cheesecloth pad

02:47.950 --> 02:49.952
is his only companion

02:49.995 --> 02:52.041
and his only comfort.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.181
Once a day, the pad is
removed for cleaning.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.406
He may die for want of love.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.169
Hello, we are unable

03:33.213 --> 03:35.258
to answer the phone right now.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.478
Please leave a message,
and we'll call you back.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.871
Hi, Mom.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.657
It's me, Joy.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.746
I'm just calling to see

03:44.789 --> 03:49.925
if you wanted to do
something for Mother's Day.

03:49.968 --> 03:54.146
Doesn't have to be a big deal.
We could go on a walk or...

03:54.190 --> 03:56.410
- Hello, who's this?
- Mom?

03:56.453 --> 03:57.846
It's Joy.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.761
Tell Dad I said hi.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.899
Do you need money again? We
can't give you any money.

04:07.943 --> 04:11.120
No, I don't need any money.

04:11.163 --> 04:14.166
I was just wondering if
you wanted to do something

04:14.210 --> 04:16.081
for Mother's Day on Sunday.

04:16.125 --> 04:19.128
Oh, Mother's Day.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.741
Your dad wants to go to
Sonoma Raceway this Sunday.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.004
Oh.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.528
It's the Sprint Cup Series now.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.051
You know he has to see it.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.879
Do you have to go with him?

04:32.533 --> 04:34.752
Mom?

04:34.796 --> 04:37.320
Are you eating?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.717
- Hello?
- ...to make a call,

04:42.760 --> 04:44.284
please hang up and try again.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.946
Pierogies, please.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.931
More pierogies!

05:32.201 --> 05:34.159
- Action! -
Today is brought to you by...

05:34.203 --> 05:35.770
Wait, what do I-- today's show--

05:35.813 --> 05:37.946
Today's show is brought
to you by hugs, got it?

05:37.989 --> 05:40.383
Okay, got it. All right, action.

05:40.427 --> 05:43.038
I hug my family. I hug my dog.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.344
I hug my best friend.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.649
I hug a log.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.175
-Cut!
-Sorry.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.655
Can we make sure
her earwig is in?

05:51.699 --> 05:53.744
Okay, guys, let's
just hold real quick.

05:53.788 --> 05:57.052
Okay, we're going again.
Take 12 for Joy. Action.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.475
- Yeah, love yourself!
- Cut.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.302
All right. Beautiful, beautiful.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.479
Ben?

06:32.522 --> 06:34.219
No, it's great.
You're just so right

06:34.263 --> 06:35.438
-for this character.
-Thanks, man.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.439
Get out of that hot suit, huh?

06:36.483 --> 06:38.223
Everyone eventually nailed it.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.008
- You were great.
- Dang it.

06:40.051 --> 06:43.011
Thank you very much.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.460
Hey, man, what are you
doing this weekend?

06:57.504 --> 06:59.462
No solid plans, man. What's up?

06:59.506 --> 07:02.117
I'm shooting a music
video up in the hills.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.553
Sick ass mansion, infinity pool.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.120
We need a black dude
for the hot tub scene.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.730
-Oh, snap, for real?
-Yeah, are you down

07:06.774 --> 07:08.079
to take your shirt off,
hang with some models?

07:08.123 --> 07:09.820
-Hell, yeah, man.
-All right, man.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.561
It doesn't pay
anything, but, uh,

07:11.605 --> 07:13.258
they got an awesome EP.
It sounds so good.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.782
-No, thank you so much.
-Hey, you killed it today.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.566
Oh, thank you.
Blessings, blessings.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.915
Great work, great work.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.482
I can twerk.

07:19.526 --> 07:20.788
I took a pole
dancing class once.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.006
I could be in the music video.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.660
Monkey, come on.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.010
I mean, you're too cute
to be a booty girl.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.664
Hey, no, don't get mad.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.231
Look, I got you
something, all right?

07:29.274 --> 07:32.103
Hold on.

07:32.147 --> 07:35.716
This is my promise to
you that you're mine.

07:35.759 --> 07:38.283
You're the one.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.068
Thank you. I love it.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.027
Hey, are we still
gonna see your mom

07:43.071 --> 07:44.899
this weekend for Mother's Day?

07:44.942 --> 07:46.553
-I got a new dress.
-Shit.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.120
That's the same
day as the shoot.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.514
I just can't pass up
this opportunity, you know?

07:51.558 --> 07:54.778
Not at this crucial
time in my career.

07:54.822 --> 07:57.128
Why don't you go see
your mom, you know?

07:59.217 --> 08:02.743
I love you.

08:02.786 --> 08:06.137
I love you!

08:06.181 --> 08:08.531
I love you!

08:11.621 --> 08:13.971
"Why don't you go see your
mom for Mother's Day?"

08:22.893 --> 08:25.330
Pierogies, please.

08:42.477 --> 08:43.871
Babe.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.568
Babe.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.962
Hey, babe, which one
of these headshots

08:48.005 --> 08:49.964
do you think looks more "CSI"?

08:50.007 --> 08:51.531
That one...

08:51.574 --> 08:53.141
Or that one?

08:53.184 --> 08:56.927
That one... Or that one?

08:56.971 --> 08:59.408
-That one?
-Ah.

08:59.451 --> 09:00.931
Hi, monkey.

09:03.238 --> 09:07.285
I'm gonna
make us some pancakes.

09:07.329 --> 09:10.114
Pineapples and pancakes.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.594
Up, up, up.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.814
Nobody ever got
famous sleeping in.

09:32.615 --> 09:35.226
You got pierogies.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.403
I didn't want to.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.581
Jesus Christ.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.673
What the fuck is wrong with you?

09:46.716 --> 09:48.022
I don't know.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.372
I felt abandoned.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.766
I promise I won't do it again.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.637
Joy... God.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.204
I got scared that
you don't really...

09:56.247 --> 09:59.599
No, that's not gonna
work anymore, Joy.

09:59.642 --> 10:00.991
You're the one, Ben.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.036
I want you to be the one so bad.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.603
Yeah?

10:03.646 --> 10:06.170
Yeah? Did you fuck him?

10:10.261 --> 10:11.611
We're done.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.309
Ben. Please.

10:15.832 --> 10:16.616
Get help.

10:22.143 --> 10:27.104
- Bonnie, sex and love addict.
- Hi, Bonnie.

10:27.148 --> 10:30.630
Rick, sex, love,
and fantasy addict.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.675
Hi, Rick.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.809
I'm Maddie, sex and love addict.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.463
Hi, Maddie.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.814
Well, I, uh...

10:40.857 --> 10:44.861
This room is very special to me

10:44.905 --> 10:47.995
because exactly eight
years ago today,

10:48.038 --> 10:52.913
I came crawling... Uh, for
the second or third time

10:52.956 --> 10:57.657
on my hands and knees
for help, right here.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.920
My childhood was
fairly textbook.

10:59.963 --> 11:03.445
Never knew my dad,
and my mom was either

11:03.488 --> 11:04.881
working or drinking,

11:04.925 --> 11:09.712
sometimes drinking and working,

11:09.756 --> 11:12.149
and my brother
and I were starved

11:12.193 --> 11:16.501
for her attention and love,
and she never gave it.

11:17.981 --> 11:22.116
And sometimes we were
just plain starving.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.726
I'd dig through the change jar

11:23.770 --> 11:26.120
and go down to the
store to buy licorice.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.122
That was the only way I
could get my brother to eat.

11:30.994 --> 11:35.390
Never really learned what a
healthy relationship could be,

11:35.433 --> 11:38.480
and I just sort
of started cycling

11:38.523 --> 11:41.178
through one bad
relationship after another.

11:41.222 --> 11:44.399
Alcoholics, addicts.

11:44.442 --> 11:47.358
I kept thinking I could
fix them, change them,

11:47.402 --> 11:49.752
make it all better.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.538
And then, uh...

11:53.582 --> 11:55.758
I married one of them,

11:55.802 --> 11:59.327
and that brought me
pretty resolutely

11:59.370 --> 12:01.982
to my very lowest low.

12:02.025 --> 12:05.899
His needs, his happiness
always came first.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.640
It was exhausting.

12:08.684 --> 12:13.645
And the more I gave,
the emptier I became.

12:13.689 --> 12:18.346
Then I found this
room and you people,

12:18.389 --> 12:22.002
so I thank you so much
for letting me share.

12:24.221 --> 12:27.703
Yeah.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.751
- Joy, sex and love addict.
- Hi, Joy.

12:31.794 --> 12:35.798
Uh, this isn't my
first time here.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.192
I tried a few of these meetings,

12:38.235 --> 12:42.544
like, a couple years ago?

12:42.587 --> 12:45.155
I didn't think I needed it.

12:45.199 --> 12:48.202
I thought you guys were weird.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.987
No offense.

12:51.031 --> 12:57.602
Anyway, I'm back because
I guess I need help.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.216
Proud of you for that.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.000
Can't complain
about that, right?

13:04.044 --> 13:06.002
Well, thank you, thank
you for everything.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.177
Bye-bye.

13:07.699 --> 13:08.831
Hi.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.399
Hi. I liked what you said.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.487
Oh, which part?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.663
Uh, the part about
getting better,

13:14.706 --> 13:16.447
about beating the addiction.

13:16.491 --> 13:20.277
I'm still an addict, I just
learned to make better choices.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.021
-That's a cute ring.
-Thanks.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.806
I had one like that.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.243
We get what we think we deserve.

13:30.418 --> 13:33.247
Hang in there.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.640
- Wait, will you be my sponsor?
- No.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.468
-No?
-I would if I could,

13:37.512 --> 13:39.122
but I can't.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.124
Oh.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.647
Just keep asking.
There's a lot of people

13:42.691 --> 13:44.736
in there who want to help.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.481
Give me your phone.

13:50.525 --> 13:54.050
You can call me if you
can't find anybody, huh?

13:54.094 --> 13:55.878
And maybe I can introduce you

13:55.922 --> 13:58.011
to someone who
might be a good fit.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.317
Okay. Thanks.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.809
-I did it.
-Did what?

14:57.853 --> 14:58.985
I got help.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.943
Oh, Joy just stop, all right?

15:00.987 --> 15:02.945
I'm an addict, Ben. I'm sick.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.947
Yeah, that's a pretty
convenient excuse.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.122
I... I like cereal.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.994
Does that make me a
fucking cereal addict?

15:08.037 --> 15:09.473
Ben.

15:09.517 --> 15:12.346
You have two days to get
your stuff and move out.

15:26.882 --> 15:31.321
God, you're so fucking hot.
I want to marry you.

15:32.888 --> 15:36.761
I like you so much.

15:36.805 --> 15:39.721
Mmm.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.506
You want a beer?

15:43.986 --> 15:46.858
Uh, no thanks.

16:43.263 --> 16:46.875
All right, so how
much do we owe you?

16:46.918 --> 16:52.228
Because I know we didn't really
discuss all the, uh... Holes.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.838
It's usually a little extra.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.885
Here, I'll give
you a little extra.

16:56.928 --> 17:00.236
All right, hey, thanks
for a great night.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.195
I mean, Chad...

17:02.238 --> 17:03.718
The guy was in
beast mode, right?

17:03.761 --> 17:05.589
He's gonna remember
this forever.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.242
Who's Chad?

17:07.287 --> 17:09.244
Jeez... The groom.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.864
Hi, Joy. It's Sam.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.910
You missed your call time.
Logan's been thinking

17:21.953 --> 17:24.260
about this a lot. He's
got to let you go, okay?

17:24.304 --> 17:26.915
We'll put your last
paycheck in the mail.

17:34.096 --> 17:38.100
Hey, you've reached Ben.
Please leave...

17:38.144 --> 17:40.102
Hey, you've reached Ben.
Please leave a...

17:41.930 --> 17:44.324
Hello, we are unable
to answer the phone.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.516
-Hi.
-Hey, it's Joy...

18:02.559 --> 18:04.822
From the meeting.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.825
I'm...

18:07.869 --> 18:09.523
Will you pick me up?

18:16.007 --> 18:19.010
Hey.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.795
How are you?

18:20.838 --> 18:26.235
I lost my boyfriend.
I lost my apartment.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.585
I lost my job.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.284
Oh, and I just banged
a bunch of random dudes

18:31.327 --> 18:34.374
at the same time,
and I don't remember.

18:36.202 --> 18:39.161
I don't know what to do anymore.

18:41.772 --> 18:45.211
I think I need help.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.169
You have any friends
you can stay with?

18:47.213 --> 18:48.866
They're his friends.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.129
Family?

18:50.172 --> 18:51.739
No fucking way. My family wants

18:51.782 --> 18:53.349
nothing to do with me.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.353
I don't have anybody.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.141
Why won't you sponsor me?

19:04.708 --> 19:07.146
It's a huge commitment.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.060
Please.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.933
You have to save yourself.
I can't do this for you.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.154
I know.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.940
It's gonna suck, and it's
gonna feel impossible.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.942
You're gonna want to give up,

19:20.985 --> 19:22.204
but you can't.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.250
You have to listen to me.

19:24.293 --> 19:28.341
Anything you say, I will do.
I promise.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.171
There's a guest house
at my grandma's,

19:32.214 --> 19:34.912
and you can stay there for a
little bit until you sober up,

19:34.956 --> 19:36.566
get your feet on the ground.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.700
Thank you.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.355
Thank you.

19:42.398 --> 19:47.447
There are gonna be very
strict rules at Nana's house.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.232
Rule number one: I
need you to go 30 days

19:50.276 --> 19:52.016
without contacting Ben,

19:52.060 --> 19:55.281
and that includes all
forms of social media.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.283
-Rule number two...
-Sorry.

19:57.326 --> 20:00.764
You should not be alone with
other possible partners.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.680
No sex. No sexting.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.292
No flirting. No intrigue.

20:06.335 --> 20:10.818
No weird Internet stuff.

20:10.861 --> 20:14.213
Rule number three:
no masturbating.

20:25.572 --> 20:29.402
Rule number four: keep
going to meetings.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.012
They're your lifeline,

20:31.055 --> 20:33.841
and they will keep you on track.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.104
All right, this
time is about you.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.498
Just you.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.500
-Thanks, Maddie.
-All right.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.287
Yeah, all right.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.854
Uh, the key is under the mat.

20:46.897 --> 20:50.510
Nana's caretaker
knows you're here,

20:50.553 --> 20:52.033
but please don't disturb him.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.296
If you need me, call me.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.646
But only if you really need me.

20:56.690 --> 20:57.821
Okay.

21:43.606 --> 21:48.089
Just 30 of these. NBD.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.918
No big D.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.160
Me time.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.293
Hey, babe,
I'm walking home.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.251
You know, I'm
thinking of picking up

22:20.295 --> 22:22.384
a goddamn pineapple, huh?
Pineapple Fridays.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.647
We should totally start that.
That's gonna be our thing.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.780
Um, let me know if you want
anything else, all right?

22:26.823 --> 22:30.174
I love you. Bye.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.394
Hey, babe, I'm walking home.
You know, I'm thinking

22:32.438 --> 22:34.570
of picking up a
goddamn pineapple.

22:34.614 --> 22:35.876
Let me know if you want
anything else, all right?

22:35.919 --> 22:37.660
I love you. Bye.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.880
Hey, babe, I'm walking home.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.587
You know, I'm
thinking of picking up

22:51.631 --> 22:53.589
a goddamn pineapple, huh?

23:03.120 --> 23:04.557
Pineapple Fridays. We
should totally start that.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.428
That's gonna be our thing.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.268
I love you. Bye.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.855
Please be Ben, please
be Ben, please be Ben.

24:30.338 --> 24:34.516
I can't do it.
I just feel so crazy.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.692
I don't know how to
be anything but crazy.

24:36.736 --> 24:39.303
I used to be crazy too.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.609
I don't believe you.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.872
Well, after my first six
months in the program,

24:42.916 --> 24:45.048
I went right back
to my boyfriend.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.441
That's not crazy.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.488
And we kept getting
together and breaking up.

24:49.531 --> 24:50.750
That's not crazy.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.795
And then I started
working two jobs

24:52.839 --> 24:55.537
so I could buy him a car,

24:55.581 --> 24:57.234
which he totaled.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.888
DUI.

24:58.932 --> 25:03.806
And then we got married
while he was in prison...

25:03.850 --> 25:06.766
And while I was
fucking my therapist...

25:06.809 --> 25:08.289
And his son.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.682
Okay, that counts.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.077
So, what are your hobbies?

25:14.121 --> 25:15.992
Besides crippling anxiety?

25:16.036 --> 25:18.517
I mean, what do you like to do?

25:18.560 --> 25:21.998
A big part of recovery is
finding something to live for.

25:22.042 --> 25:27.177
You ought to try things.
Read, learn... Play.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.962
Get curious.

27:37.830 --> 27:40.093
Excuse me.

27:41.747 --> 27:44.663
Excuse me. Excuse me!

27:44.706 --> 27:47.927
Hi. You can't play those.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.493
I'm sorry, who are you?

27:49.537 --> 27:50.886
I live here. You
can't play those.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.845
Oh, Maddie didn't
tell me you live here.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.281
Maddie's my sister.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.675
Oh, hi. I'm Joy.
Nice to meet you.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.024
Okay, great.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.548
Now, please get
out of my garage.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.248
I need
you to leave now.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.124
My name is Jim.

29:19.409 --> 29:21.281
Fucking shit. Fuck.

30:00.407 --> 30:01.408
Hi.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.076
Right hand on the high hat.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.818
One, two, three, four.

30:29.523 --> 30:32.265
Don't squeeze them
with a death grip.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.136
Hold them like baby birds.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.790
Let them breathe.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.445
Good.

30:38.488 --> 30:41.404
Okay, now same beat,
please, and no showboating.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.228
What are you doing?

31:23.142 --> 31:24.926
I said no showboating.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.015
-I was backing you up.
-No, no.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.364
You know what? You got to go.

31:29.931 --> 31:30.714
Go.

31:41.900 --> 31:46.382
I think every woman I
date is the woman of my dreams.

31:46.426 --> 31:48.732
If a woman is even nice to me,

31:48.776 --> 31:51.822
I've already pictured
her in a wedding dress,

31:51.866 --> 31:54.564
and when she does make
herself available,

31:54.608 --> 31:57.002
I just want to go
find someone else.

31:57.045 --> 31:59.134
Another fantasy.

31:59.178 --> 32:02.181
Thanks for
everyone's shares.

32:02.224 --> 32:05.358
I really related to all of them,

32:06.011 --> 32:07.708
so thank you.

32:08.752 --> 32:09.623
Um...

32:12.408 --> 32:14.410
My dad was obsessed with women.

32:18.066 --> 32:22.418
Our garage was...
Covered in centerfolds.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.421
Naked women everywhere.

32:26.857 --> 32:30.426
And he watched a lot of porn.

32:30.470 --> 32:35.475
Whenever I was home alone,
I'd sneak into the garage,

32:35.518 --> 32:37.564
and I watched it.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.046
I think I was, like, five or six

32:41.089 --> 32:42.438
when I started doing it.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.617
I remember, the first time
I watched it, I was like,

32:47.661 --> 32:50.794
"I don't know what
the hell this is!"

32:50.838 --> 32:54.450
But... My body felt crazy.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.975
I wanted to watch
it all the time.

33:00.804 --> 33:04.460
I looked at all those women...

33:06.071 --> 33:07.202
And I thought...

33:08.856 --> 33:11.206
"That's what I want to be.

33:11.250 --> 33:12.903
That's who my dad loves."

33:16.124 --> 33:17.604
I don't know, whatever.

33:18.953 --> 33:19.998
Thanks for letting me share.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.612
Hey, you didn't tell me

33:25.655 --> 33:27.396
your brother lives
with your grandma.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.658
He didn't bother you, did he?

33:29.442 --> 33:31.357
No.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.360
Well, he's got real
problems, mental health issues,

33:34.403 --> 33:37.711
and he's basically a recluse.

33:37.754 --> 33:39.800
I'm surprised he even
came out of the house.

33:39.843 --> 33:42.237
I saw him checking the mail,

33:42.281 --> 33:45.197
and I introduced
myself to be polite.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.241
No biggie at all.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.156
Good.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.376
Just leave him alone, and
he'll leave you alone, okay?

36:23.268 --> 36:25.008
That was tight.

36:25.052 --> 36:26.053
So good.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.272
Holy shit, that was tight.

36:27.315 --> 36:28.838
We got to record that next time.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.753
Yeah.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.799
My recording setup is pretty lo-fi,
you know, but it sounds good.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.496
I can add some reverb,
dip the treble.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.759
Yeah, yeah, verb the trebs.

36:39.849 --> 36:41.373
What's your grandma like?

36:41.416 --> 36:43.418
Nana? She's cool.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.988
She basically raised
me and Maddie.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.859
She takes care of me.
I take care of her.

36:49.903 --> 36:52.297
It's a symbiotic relationship.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.386
She likes watching musicals

36:54.429 --> 36:56.823
and enjoys the works
of Shakespeare.

36:59.042 --> 36:59.782
What else do you want to know?

37:03.830 --> 37:05.788
I'm hungry. You want to eat?

37:08.269 --> 37:11.229
Keep the change, my man.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.274
Come on, let's eat
at the table inside.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.102
Oh...

37:15.145 --> 37:18.279
I probably shouldn't
go in your house.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.629
I promised myself I'd only
go as far as this garage.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.042
You really like orange juice.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.696
I love orange juice.

37:51.791 --> 37:54.097
So you're in 12-step
with my sister?

37:54.141 --> 37:55.316
Mm-hmm.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.752
Is she your sponsor?

37:57.275 --> 37:58.450
Yeah.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.061
Do you like her?

38:01.104 --> 38:02.018
Yeah.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.457
-Do you?
-What?

38:05.500 --> 38:06.632
Do you like her?

38:06.675 --> 38:07.720
Yes.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.292
You're not hungry?

38:14.335 --> 38:18.600
It's been really hard to eat...
And sleep,

38:18.644 --> 38:21.516
and, like, be a human being.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.213
Everything's a fucking trigger.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.347
What does that mean?

38:26.391 --> 38:28.393
Trigger?

38:28.436 --> 38:34.355
Uh, something that intensely
makes you feel a feeling

38:34.399 --> 38:37.489
that you really
don't want to feel.

38:37.532 --> 38:41.057
It makes you react compulsively.

38:41.101 --> 38:43.146
Oh, I have a lot
of triggers then.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.496
Exactly.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.149
The whole fucking
world is a trigger.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.369
I know. I'm triggered
by everything.

38:48.413 --> 38:49.675
I'm triggered by pancakes.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.198
Pancakes?

38:51.241 --> 38:52.939
My boyfriend...

38:52.982 --> 38:56.159
Ex-boyfriend made good pancakes.

38:56.203 --> 38:58.771
I'm triggered by
family, sad songs...

39:00.381 --> 39:01.208
Pierogies.

39:02.252 --> 39:03.819
I could see that.

39:07.997 --> 39:10.739
What is happening right now?
What are you doing?

39:13.220 --> 39:16.745
Nana taught us to do
that when we were little.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.530
She said, "Cookies
don't create my fortune.

39:18.573 --> 39:21.010
"I create my fortune."

39:21.054 --> 39:22.577
And she taught us
that there are many

39:22.621 --> 39:24.362
much better tasting
cookies in the world,

39:24.405 --> 39:26.668
and we shouldn't waste our
dessert on a shit cookie.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.410
Nana's amazing.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.978
I know. She's cool.

39:32.021 --> 39:32.805
You're cool.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.693
I'm glad Maddie's
sponsoring again.

39:51.737 --> 39:52.868
I didn't think she would.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.218
Why?

39:55.262 --> 39:56.829
Well, she used to
sponsor this girl Kelly.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.396
She stayed here too.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.528
Oh, really? What happened?

40:00.572 --> 40:01.877
She killed herself.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.927
She was a
really nice person too.

40:10.451 --> 40:12.671
Nana's about to wake
up from her nap.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.934
Her naps are always
two hours long.

40:14.977 --> 40:16.805
Not a minute less,
not a minute more.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.154
How'd she do it?

40:18.894 --> 40:20.243
What?

40:20.287 --> 40:21.984
How'd she kill herself?

40:22.028 --> 40:24.726
Oh, she just took
a bunch of pills

40:24.770 --> 40:26.467
and passed out in the bathtub.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.034
Pretty standard stuff.

40:32.038 --> 40:33.909
Hi, Kelly.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.956
It's me, Joy.

40:39.524 --> 40:43.919
I don't want to be weird.
I just wanted to say hi...

40:48.271 --> 40:51.753
And I'm sorry, and...

40:54.147 --> 40:55.888
I get you.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.110
I'm gonna try harder for
the both of us, okay?

41:57.602 --> 41:59.517
How did it sound?

41:59.560 --> 42:00.387
I think we got it.

42:01.301 --> 42:03.042
I can do it faster.

42:05.392 --> 42:06.698
Do you want me to?

42:11.572 --> 42:13.182
Hey, can I ask you something?

42:14.923 --> 42:17.099
Why did Kelly kill herself?

42:17.143 --> 42:18.927
How can I answer that?

42:18.971 --> 42:22.540
I mean... Did you have any
sense of what was wrong?

42:22.583 --> 42:24.019
No.

42:24.063 --> 42:25.847
Did she give you
any warning signs?

42:25.891 --> 42:29.590
Maybe she knew she
was terminally ill.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.550
Maybe she was bored.
Maybe she got dumped

42:32.593 --> 42:33.812
and was sad like you.

42:41.428 --> 42:44.736
Well... Nana's still sleeping.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.089
What are you doing right now?

42:51.394 --> 42:53.179
I hope so.

42:53.222 --> 42:55.398
Bobby certainly has taken
charge of those boys.

42:55.442 --> 42:57.009
"I'm
just a helpless woman

42:57.052 --> 42:59.620
"with no self-worth because
society says I'm nothing

42:59.664 --> 43:01.404
"unless a man saves me.

43:01.448 --> 43:03.102
"Save me, save me!

43:03.145 --> 43:05.974
"Your breath smells like
farts, but save me."

43:06.018 --> 43:08.586
"These mouth farts are
just for you, my dear.

43:08.629 --> 43:10.326
"My mother never ever loved me,

43:10.370 --> 43:12.241
"but you look just like
her so I'll take it."

43:15.854 --> 43:17.595
-Trigger.
-What?

43:17.638 --> 43:18.465
Trigger.

43:22.121 --> 43:23.339
Trigger.

43:24.689 --> 43:26.255
Trigger.

43:36.657 --> 43:38.224
You like this show?

43:38.267 --> 43:40.008
Love yourself.

43:40.052 --> 43:42.010
-Happy-Happy loves you.
-I'm sorry.

43:42.054 --> 43:43.098
You didn't say trigger.

43:44.230 --> 43:45.231
That was Ben.

43:46.362 --> 43:47.625
Who's Ben?

43:47.668 --> 43:49.801
My boyfriend. My ex-boyfriend.

43:51.237 --> 43:52.455
The hedgehog?

43:52.499 --> 43:53.413
Yeah.

43:54.806 --> 43:57.591
Your ex-boyfriend
is a fuzzy hedgehog?

43:59.158 --> 44:00.594
You got dumped by a hedgehog?

44:07.122 --> 44:10.517
Joy, come on. It's okay.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.084
No, it isn't.

44:12.127 --> 44:14.303
He's clearly a loser. You
could do better than that.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.662
It's okay. It's okay.

44:26.881 --> 44:30.058
Come on, stop being a
baby and just get over it.

44:30.102 --> 44:32.844
I can't just get over it.

44:32.887 --> 44:36.064
I wouldn't need to be here
if I could just get over it.

44:36.108 --> 44:38.066
Yeah, you can.

44:38.110 --> 44:39.720
Maybe if you weren't
so self-centered,

44:39.764 --> 44:42.288
you'd realize the world
has much bigger problems.

44:42.331 --> 44:44.725
So just let go and
move on already.

44:44.769 --> 44:46.074
I'm sure he has.

44:47.859 --> 44:49.512
You're an asshole.

44:54.692 --> 44:58.565
I am strong.

44:58.608 --> 45:00.567
I am smart.

45:01.524 --> 45:03.744
I am beautiful.

45:03.788 --> 45:07.661
I am enough for this moment.

45:07.705 --> 45:11.839
"I am Happy-Happy, and
I'm a fucking douchebag."

45:11.883 --> 45:14.712
I am a good person.

45:17.976 --> 45:19.673
I am a pizza.

45:30.597 --> 45:31.903
Joy?

45:35.950 --> 45:37.604
You know, I can see you.

45:38.997 --> 45:40.781
Joy, do you want a
popsicle that's made

45:40.825 --> 45:42.217
of American flag colors?

45:42.870 --> 45:43.915
I can't.

45:44.654 --> 45:45.525
Oh.

45:45.568 --> 45:46.308
I'm busy.

45:48.180 --> 45:49.311
Yeah, okay.

45:55.100 --> 45:55.927
Thanks!

47:14.266 --> 47:15.963
Okay, let's get you out, Nana.

48:19.592 --> 48:22.769
Today is August 19, 1998.

48:23.639 --> 48:26.686
It's 1:33 a.m.

48:47.272 --> 48:48.969
I'm so sorry.

48:49.013 --> 48:50.536
What are you doing?

48:52.494 --> 48:54.583
-No one's heard these.
-Don't!

48:54.627 --> 48:55.715
-They're gonna be buried with me.
-Don't do that!

49:07.335 --> 49:08.597
So what do you think?

49:10.077 --> 49:10.991
About what?

49:12.036 --> 49:13.298
The song.

49:15.039 --> 49:16.605
I thought it was beautiful.

49:19.347 --> 49:20.653
Do you want to see something?

50:37.251 --> 50:39.123
-Hey.
-Hey.

50:39.166 --> 50:41.386
It's so cool you're keeping
up with the painting.

50:41.429 --> 50:44.128
Oh, yeah, just messing around.

50:44.171 --> 50:46.043
I was just dropping
off my nana's meds,

50:46.086 --> 50:49.437
so I thought I'd check
in and see you're doing.

50:49.481 --> 50:50.395
How you doing?

50:50.438 --> 50:51.439
I'm good.

50:51.483 --> 50:53.006
No contact with Ben, right?

50:53.050 --> 50:54.312
None.

50:54.355 --> 50:56.401
No acting out at all?

50:56.444 --> 50:57.619
Nope. Totally clean.

51:01.493 --> 51:03.103
I guess I'll go see my nana.

51:03.147 --> 51:04.844
And Jim.

51:04.887 --> 51:07.238
Jim and I are taking a break
from each other right now.

51:07.281 --> 51:09.457
My sponsor suggested it.

51:10.284 --> 51:11.981
I am proud of you.

51:12.025 --> 51:14.201
Thanks.

51:18.510 --> 51:21.861
"Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

51:21.904 --> 51:25.995
"And summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

51:26.039 --> 51:29.260
"Sometime too hot the
eye of heaven shines."

51:29.303 --> 51:30.609
I need to talk to Nana.

51:43.100 --> 51:44.753
Hi, Nana.

51:46.973 --> 51:49.715
Hey.

51:49.758 --> 51:51.543
Hi. It's Maddie.

51:52.152 --> 51:53.980
Hi.

52:01.944 --> 52:04.033
We could also
just be J and J,

52:04.077 --> 52:06.906
and "All The Way" could be
the name of our first album.

52:06.949 --> 52:09.561
Oh... I don't know.

52:09.604 --> 52:13.521
I haven't really thought
about us as an actual band.

52:13.565 --> 52:16.220
Kind of pursuing my
solo thing, you know?

52:16.263 --> 52:18.787
Thanks, though. You're
a really good artist.

52:23.227 --> 52:27.318
Let's start with "Here's
to the Trigger," yeah?

52:27.361 --> 52:31.365
All right. One, two, one, two...

52:31.409 --> 52:33.193
All right, what's wrong?

52:34.934 --> 52:36.196
Come on, Joy, what?

54:47.588 --> 54:49.851
So why do we need
to know about this?

54:50.983 --> 54:52.811
Mom, I told you.

54:52.854 --> 54:55.248
I just want you
to know who I am.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.294
I want you in my life.

54:57.337 --> 55:00.688
I've been working really
hard on being really honest

55:00.732 --> 55:02.821
and looking at my patterns

55:02.864 --> 55:06.520
and talking to people about it.

55:06.564 --> 55:08.130
I'm not the only one.
There are other people

55:08.174 --> 55:10.568
out there just like me
with the same addictions.

55:10.611 --> 55:12.004
We all just want love

55:12.047 --> 55:15.312
and intimacy and
connection, but...

55:15.355 --> 55:18.315
We don't know how to get it
without hurting ourselves.

55:19.620 --> 55:22.362
No one showed us how.

55:22.406 --> 55:24.495
It's okay.

55:24.538 --> 55:26.888
I'll make you spaghetti.
Your favorite.

55:31.545 --> 55:33.547
Your Uncle Louie was an addict.

55:35.854 --> 55:38.117
Couldn't stop buying hats.

56:25.164 --> 56:28.167
I enjoy reading books, writing,

56:28.210 --> 56:29.995
and playing the piano.

56:30.038 --> 56:32.780
But most of all, I love dancing.

56:37.872 --> 56:39.396
It was so crazy.

56:39.439 --> 56:43.487
I could really see my
parents, you know what I mean?

56:45.445 --> 56:48.274
They'll never be what
I want them to be.

56:48.317 --> 56:51.408
I can stop expecting
them to be somebody else.

56:51.451 --> 56:53.322
They're human beings

56:53.366 --> 56:55.673
who have no idea what
they're doing, just like me.

56:58.197 --> 57:00.025
One, two...

57:00.068 --> 57:01.592
I feel really stupid right now,

57:01.635 --> 57:03.463
like you're not getting it.

57:03.507 --> 57:05.465
I get it, Joy.
I just want to play.

57:05.509 --> 57:08.381
Do you get it? I don't
think you get it.

57:08.425 --> 57:09.556
I get it.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.471
-Do you though?
-I get it.

57:11.515 --> 57:13.430
Do you even realize how
long you've been talking?

57:13.473 --> 57:15.432
Oh. Okay.

57:15.475 --> 57:17.303
Let's play now.

57:20.219 --> 57:23.440
Are you acting out?
Is this acting out?

57:27.835 --> 57:28.923
Stop.

57:29.968 --> 57:32.840
I get it, Joy! I get it!

57:33.972 --> 57:36.583
My dad was drunk and left us.

57:36.627 --> 57:39.064
My mom was miserable
and left us.

57:39.107 --> 57:41.980
My sister won't talk to me.
I miss her.

57:44.112 --> 57:46.071
I'm wearing my
underwear inside out

57:46.114 --> 57:48.029
because I don't care enough
about myself to do laundry,

57:48.073 --> 57:50.292
so, yeah... I get it.

57:52.686 --> 57:54.514
This morning, I woke up thinking

57:54.558 --> 57:56.777
I was holding someone's hand...

57:57.865 --> 57:59.737
But it was just my other hand.

58:03.218 --> 58:05.482
Sometimes I sleep with a
phone book on top of me

58:05.525 --> 58:06.961
because it feels like love.

58:09.398 --> 58:11.096
I can't eat Gummy Bears

58:11.139 --> 58:12.880
because I think
they have feelings.

58:23.282 --> 58:24.152
You're my friend.

58:30.245 --> 58:32.030
Are you asking me or
are you telling me?

58:34.728 --> 58:36.948
You're my friend, Jim.

58:37.949 --> 58:39.037
I'm just saying.

58:42.954 --> 58:43.998
Yeah.

58:46.697 --> 58:48.263
You're my friend.

58:51.353 --> 58:52.093
Weirdo.

58:56.794 --> 58:58.578
You ready to play now?

58:59.710 --> 59:00.754
Yeah.

59:07.587 --> 59:09.067
I wrote a song.

01:01:04.573 --> 01:01:06.880
What the fuck is this?

01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:10.014
Maddie, we're just friends.

01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:13.539
I'm so stupid.

01:01:13.582 --> 01:01:16.063
I came by to congratulate
you on all your progress.

01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:20.372
What the hell are you doing?

01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:22.461
Oh, so it's okay
to talk to me now?

01:01:22.504 --> 01:01:24.637
Did you make sure your
sponsor's cool with it

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.901
or are you breaking one
of the rules right now?

01:01:27.945 --> 01:01:29.773
You told me you were committed
to taking care of Nana.

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:31.557
Here we go.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.515
If you can't handle it,
you need to tell me.

01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:34.952
She's napping, Maddie.
She's fine.

01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:36.605
If you can't do it, Jim,

01:01:36.649 --> 01:01:38.042
we're gonna have to
put her in a home.

01:01:38.085 --> 01:01:39.913
This is her fucking home!

01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:41.523
Oh, you are so selfish.

01:01:41.567 --> 01:01:44.048
This is about what
Nana needs, not you.

01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:45.789
You have no fucking
idea what she needs!

01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:47.660
You're so wrapped up in
your own personal tragedy

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.096
and your 12-step cult,

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.532
you don't see anything
outside of that anymore.

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:51.925
You've checked
out of this family

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:52.970
a long fucking time ago.

01:01:53.013 --> 01:01:55.581
Joy, tell me the truth.

01:01:55.624 --> 01:01:57.061
Are you two sleeping together?

01:01:57.104 --> 01:01:58.671
You think you know
everything, but you don't.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.542
Nana is doing
great, and so am I.

01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:03.197
Not everyone needs saving.
We're happy here.

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.982
Oh, of course you are.
You have a new girlfriend.

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:07.071
She's not my
girlfriend, you asshole.

01:02:07.114 --> 01:02:08.246
I don't even think she's cute.

01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:13.512
You're self destructing.
You know that.

01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:16.558
There are rules to
follow, and if you don't,

01:02:16.602 --> 01:02:19.083
you will end up right
back where you started,

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:21.999
and it will feel so much worse.

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.219
I'm not like Kelly, okay?

01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:26.568
You don't have to worry.

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:42.280
Hey, don't mind Maddie.
She's crazy.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.818
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:03:41.861 --> 01:03:43.210
-Have a nice day.
-Hey.

01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:46.866
Hey.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:47.954
How are you?

01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:50.609
Good. How are you?

01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:52.393
Good.

01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:54.526
-Good... Good.
-That's good.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.704
I've, uh...

01:03:58.747 --> 01:04:00.662
Been thinking about
you a lot recently.

01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:04.057
Yeah, I've been
thinking about you too.

01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:07.626
Um...

01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:08.888
What are you doing right now?

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:09.802
Are... Are you busy?

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.674
Uh, no.

01:04:12.718 --> 01:04:15.677
Um, I'm just
shopping for balloons

01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:18.419
because I'm supposed
to love myself

01:04:18.463 --> 01:04:20.857
and do things like that now.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:21.988
-Um...
-Okay.

01:04:22.032 --> 01:04:23.120
How about you?

01:04:23.163 --> 01:04:25.470
I am getting some glow sticks

01:04:25.513 --> 01:04:27.864
for Logan's warehouse rave.

01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:28.821
Nice.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:29.909
Yeah.

01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:31.650
Yeah.

01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:32.520
Yeah.

01:04:32.564 --> 01:04:33.695
Yeah.

01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:44.706
Oh, God.

01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.673
So what else is new?

01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:56.414
Um...

01:04:57.371 --> 01:04:59.199
I'm in a band.

01:04:59.243 --> 01:05:00.766
Yeah?

01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:02.028
Oh, cool.

01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:03.769
Yeah, I'm, uh, you know,

01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:06.119
glad we've both been doing
our own thing, you know?

01:05:06.163 --> 01:05:09.079
I've got some stuff going on
too, so I definitely, you know,

01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:11.472
I think we should
keep that going.

01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:13.300
It's cute you're
in a band though.

01:05:13.344 --> 01:05:14.954
Uh, you're not singing?

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:17.174
'Cause we've seen
you at karaoke, 'cause...

01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:18.915
No, I'm just saying, you know,

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:20.351
you always try to... Monkey...

01:05:23.136 --> 01:05:25.573
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:31.492
Your balloons! You...

01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:05.526
Hey.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:06.397
Hey.

01:06:08.312 --> 01:06:09.443
I made this for you.

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:16.973
See you.

01:06:21.238 --> 01:06:23.022
Who was that?

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:25.416
I have no idea.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:29.376
What happened to 30 days?

01:06:30.856 --> 01:06:33.032
I ran into Ben at
the party store.

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.036
I told him I was in a band.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.125
And then you fucked
some random dude?

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:40.648
Yeah, I know.

01:06:40.692 --> 01:06:41.823
I'm the worst
person in the world.

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:43.912
No.

01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:45.392
But you're acting really stupid.

01:06:45.436 --> 01:06:47.655
I get it. I'm stupid, okay?

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.181
Why would you even care?

01:06:51.224 --> 01:06:52.878
I thought we were friends.

01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:55.228
We're not friends, you idiot.
I love you.

01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:56.360
No, you don't.

01:06:56.403 --> 01:06:58.057
Yeah, I do.

01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:00.581
No, you need to grow up.
You're a fucking lunatic baby.

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:02.366
Oh, really? Takes
one to know one.

01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:03.802
That's what babies say.

01:07:03.845 --> 01:07:05.369
You need to need
to fucking grow up.

01:07:05.412 --> 01:07:06.935
Look at yourself. Look at me.

01:07:06.979 --> 01:07:09.242
We ruin people's lives.
That's who we are!

01:07:11.244 --> 01:07:13.812
Let's get out of each other's
lives and save ourselves.

01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:16.945
I'm eating this cake.

01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:54.244
Hi, you've reached Maddie.
Leave a message.

01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:56.637
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.509
Hey, Maddie, it's Joy.

01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:02.252
I relapsed.

01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:03.992
Not with Jim...

01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:06.952
With Ben and some other people.

01:08:08.258 --> 01:08:10.477
You were right.

01:08:10.521 --> 01:08:12.000
It's worse than before.

01:08:14.568 --> 01:08:17.876
I'm so sorry for everything.

01:08:17.919 --> 01:08:19.573
You've been nothing
but kind to me.

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:24.143
When I said I'm not like
Kelly, I just meant...

01:08:26.624 --> 01:08:28.104
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:29.453
I promise.

01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:36.895
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

01:09:04.488 --> 01:09:06.925
Sorry. Sorry.

01:09:06.968 --> 01:09:08.144
Sorry.

01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:11.582
Sorry.

01:09:16.716 --> 01:09:17.675
Not sorry.

01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:08.073
Jim?

01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:21.869
Jim?

01:10:24.132 --> 01:10:25.133
Jim?

01:10:28.267 --> 01:10:29.268
Oh, hi.

01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:32.140
Do you know where Jim is?

01:10:37.798 --> 01:10:39.626
What are you watching?

01:11:21.886 --> 01:11:23.191
I gotta go.

01:11:24.889 --> 01:11:26.760
It was nice meeting you.

01:11:43.734 --> 01:11:45.213
What was that?

01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:49.800
Jim?

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:10.342
Oh, let me help.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:11.822
Thanks.

01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:14.433
All righty.

01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:23.834
I know you're not like Kelly.

01:13:27.185 --> 01:13:28.578
What was she like?

01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:31.972
Oh, she was... Complicated.

01:13:33.496 --> 01:13:35.802
And awesome,

01:13:35.846 --> 01:13:39.066
and she had a great big
heart, just like you,

01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:42.635
But she didn't have
the strength you have.

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:48.293
She was not gonna make it
through the darkest moments,

01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:51.601
but I know you will,

01:13:55.866 --> 01:13:57.694
I think about her all the time.

01:13:58.695 --> 01:14:00.087
It keeps me going.

01:14:00.914 --> 01:14:02.176
Yeah, me too.

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.659
She was lucky to have you.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.053
Thanks.

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:04.717
Pretty crazy how we can
go through a bunch of stuff

01:15:04.761 --> 01:15:06.153
and not die.

01:15:09.809 --> 01:15:13.247
Time doesn't exist,

01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:17.251
and five-year-old you
is cheering you on.

01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:23.388
So, is there
anybody here today

01:15:23.431 --> 01:15:26.304
who has one-month of sobriety?

01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:29.742
Congratulations.

01:15:31.222 --> 01:15:32.702
Three months?

01:15:40.318 --> 01:15:42.015
Six months?

01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:46.019
Nine months?

01:15:48.195 --> 01:15:49.545
One year?

01:15:59.816 --> 01:16:02.166
Hey.

01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:05.430
I did it.

01:16:05.473 --> 01:16:06.953
You did it.

01:16:06.997 --> 01:16:08.651
Now, the next time I see you

01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:10.304
we're gonna have to start
talking about a dating plan.

01:16:10.348 --> 01:16:11.958
That sounds terrible.

01:16:12.002 --> 01:16:14.352
Oh, it is.
And then it's not.

01:16:16.397 --> 01:16:19.009
Listen, I want to thank
you for something.

01:16:19.749 --> 01:16:22.229
Thank me?

01:16:22.273 --> 01:16:26.843
Jim and I, we love
each other so much.

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:29.585
We've always been the
only other stable person

01:16:29.628 --> 01:16:31.151
in each other's lives.

01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:33.937
I almost really
fucked that up...

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:37.593
And we're so good now, I...

01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:39.725
I just wanted to thank you

01:16:39.769 --> 01:16:41.597
for helping me find
my brother again.

01:16:42.989 --> 01:16:45.644
I love you, Maddie.

01:16:45.688 --> 01:16:46.732
I love you too, Joy.

01:16:48.691 --> 01:16:50.823
- Please.
- Come on.

01:17:01.442 --> 01:17:03.183
Ah!

01:17:41.352 --> 01:17:43.049
"Here's to the
Trigger" sounded so tight

01:17:43.093 --> 01:17:45.008
with the synth you added.

01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:46.270
So tight.

01:17:47.706 --> 01:17:49.316
Did you like the hand claps?

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.101
Loved the hand claps.

01:17:51.144 --> 01:17:53.494
Were the sirens at
the end too much?

01:17:53.538 --> 01:17:55.714
I would normally roll
my eyes at sirens,

01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:57.324
but you layered them
in there so gracefully,

01:17:57.368 --> 01:17:59.283
I hardly knew what
the sound was.

01:18:01.894 --> 01:18:03.330
You're really talented.

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:05.898
Thank you.

01:18:08.771 --> 01:18:10.033
How are you?

01:18:10.076 --> 01:18:12.122
I'm good. Mm-hmm.

01:18:12.775 --> 01:18:13.993
How are you?

01:18:14.646 --> 01:18:16.082
I'm good.

01:18:18.606 --> 01:18:20.347
How are you really?

01:18:22.349 --> 01:18:24.177
"How are you really?"

01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:28.094
Good. I said I'm good.

01:18:31.445 --> 01:18:33.883
I mean, you know, I missed you.

01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:35.972
My music got so much
better playing with you,

01:18:36.015 --> 01:18:38.931
and it was fun.

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:41.586
I missed you too.

01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:46.896
I play acoustic sets

01:18:46.939 --> 01:18:50.116
at the Pig and Whistle
now every Sunday.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.424
Nobody pays attention,
but I don't care.

01:18:53.467 --> 01:18:55.121
And Maddie and her
boyfriend eat dinner

01:18:55.165 --> 01:18:56.601
with me and Nana once a week.

01:18:58.472 --> 01:18:59.560
Pretty cool.

01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:03.521
Oh, I started making waffles

01:19:03.564 --> 01:19:05.915
with the waffle iron
that I purchased.

01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:07.394
That's fucking awesome.

01:19:07.438 --> 01:19:08.700
It really is.

01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:11.703
I think we're gonna be okay.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.272
We are okay. Both of us.

01:19:41.385 --> 01:19:42.473
God.

01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:48.261
Ah.

01:19:53.658 --> 01:19:54.615
You wanna play?

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.054
Yeah.
