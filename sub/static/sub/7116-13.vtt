00:17.240 --> 00:20.950
I know... I know.
I look tired and awful.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.080
You know how I know?

00:22.120 --> 00:23.980
'Cuz I was just walkin' down the hall,

00:24.020 --> 00:30.280
and Jesse the janitor goes to me, "hiya
Tori... you look tired and awful, duhh."

00:30.320 --> 00:32.720
Well, I'm not agreeing
that you look tired and awful...

00:32.790 --> 00:34.850
But why do you?

00:34.890 --> 00:36.020
You wanna know why?

00:36.060 --> 00:38.800
Okay. Here's what's going on
in my life right now.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.100
First, I'm supposed to...

00:45.620 --> 00:47.870
Do you have to play that now?

00:49.100 --> 00:50.380
Yes.

00:55.070 --> 00:58.380
- I'm supposed to write a one-act
play for Sikowitz's class,

00:58.410 --> 01:02.880
and Trina has a head cold and blows her
nose all night long which wakes me up,

01:02.920 --> 01:05.019
and I've spent like
a billion hours trying to make.

01:05.060 --> 01:09.090
This stupid venetian carnival
mask for my world cultures class!

01:09.130 --> 01:10.790
Mm, let's see it.

01:13.230 --> 01:14.540
Hey, you look better!

01:21.970 --> 01:25.610
Oh my God, I am so sick...
Feel how heavy this is.

01:25.650 --> 01:26.840
Oh.

01:32.020 --> 01:33.860
I think you really need to get some rest.

01:33.890 --> 01:35.230
I can't rest.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.320
I have to go to the bathroom and
wash this Trina goo off my hand!

01:40.300 --> 01:43.900
You guys! You guys, have
either of you seen Jade?

01:43.970 --> 01:45.640
- No.
- Uh-uh. Why, what's up with Jade?

01:45.710 --> 01:49.110
- She's trying to kill me!
- Any reason?

01:49.140 --> 01:50.640
Well, we were hanging out last night.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.710
And she asked me to do her eyebrows.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.620
- Do what to 'em?
- Make 'em look neater and nicer.

01:55.650 --> 01:58.560
Girls do that.
We groom each other like monkeys.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.590
So, why is Jade trying to kill you?

02:02.630 --> 02:04.840
- Well...
- Where is she?!

02:06.670 --> 02:09.370
Stop her!
Somebody stop Cat right now!!!

02:09.400 --> 02:10.870
- Hide me!
- Come here!

02:10.900 --> 02:13.370
- Please hide me!
- No! Come here!

02:13.410 --> 02:15.540
- Stop. Come here!
- Oh, hide meeeeee!!!

02:15.580 --> 02:16.570
Don't touch him!

02:17.710 --> 02:19.180
- Hide me!
- Come here!

02:19.250 --> 02:23.220
What do you... stop!
Like, Jade, stop! Relax!

02:24.660 --> 02:27.060
- What was that about?
- Why are you so mad at Cat?

02:32.230 --> 02:35.810
Don't... say... a word.

Oh, I do look tired and awful.

03:53.740 --> 03:56.080
And now my hands smell like sink water.

04:12.450 --> 04:13.920
Hello?

04:22.930 --> 04:26.370
- This stall is taken.
- Are you okay?

04:27.290 --> 04:28.220
Why?

04:28.730 --> 04:33.050
Well... you're sitting there on a
toilet, eating a sandwich, and crying.

04:33.290 --> 04:36.710
I knowwwwww.

04:39.650 --> 04:43.100
Bye, sandwich.
I wish I could go with you.

04:45.290 --> 04:51.560
Awww, c'mere... c'mon...
Here, dry your eyes with this.

04:56.260 --> 04:58.480
This paper towel smells like sink water.

04:59.450 --> 05:00.600
I know.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.780
- Uh, what's your name?
- Ponnie.

05:04.810 --> 05:08.550
- Well, hi, Bonnie, I'm Tori.
- No... Ponnie.

05:08.580 --> 05:12.610
My name is Ponnie... with a "p."
Ponnie!

05:13.270 --> 05:19.950
- Oh. That's... different.
- I know... I have a baaaad naaaame.

05:22.220 --> 05:24.010
You have a great name.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.370
I always wished my name was...
Pori.

05:30.270 --> 05:32.800
- You're nice.
- Thanks.

05:32.910 --> 05:35.210
So you must be new here at Hollywood arts.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.310
No. I've been going to
school here for three years.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.050
- You have?
- Totes.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.650
I was in the spring showcase with you.

05:45.370 --> 05:48.580
Ohhhh yeeeeaaaah.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.820
You don't have to lie.
Nobody ever remembers me.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.630
Well, maybe people would remember you more.

05:56.700 --> 06:00.070
If you didn't eat lunch here
in the bathroom by yourself.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.000
You wanna eat lunch in here with me?

06:04.110 --> 06:07.410
- No, I didn't mean...
- There's room for two in the handicapped stall.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.150
Why don't you come have lunch
with me and my friends?

06:12.230 --> 06:15.320
- Ya mean it?
- Let's go.

06:16.550 --> 06:17.880
- Okey-doke.

06:25.660 --> 06:29.400
Oh my God, look what just came out of me!

06:29.430 --> 06:32.490
Let's go, let's go.

06:41.380 --> 06:45.360
Um... I think you look
nice with no eyebrows.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.720
Jade... I just wanna say...

06:50.750 --> 06:53.390
I really appreciate you
having lunch with us,

06:54.760 --> 06:59.430
and thank you, Andre and Beck, for
handcuffing Jade to the table.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.190
- Sure.
- No problem.

07:04.030 --> 07:05.570
I still don't get how this happened.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.240
Well, Jade asked me
to make her eyebrows look nice.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.370
So I tried to wax them,

07:08.400 --> 07:11.270
but when I took
the wax strips off there was...

07:12.560 --> 07:14.740
Um... a problem.

07:14.780 --> 07:17.550
- My eyebrows are gone!
- No they're not!

07:17.580 --> 07:19.680
I told you, they're right here!

07:23.420 --> 07:24.890
I've never eaten out here before.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.890
Ah, it's just like
eating in the bathroom...

07:27.190 --> 07:30.390
- Y'know... without the toilet.
- Right.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.430
You guys...

07:33.460 --> 07:35.400
Hey everyone! Special treat.

07:35.430 --> 07:38.130
I just found a new friend...
On a toilet...

07:38.350 --> 07:42.960
She's fun and she likes sandwiches...
Say hey to Ponnie.

07:44.430 --> 07:47.560
- Ponnie?
- Who are you talkin' about?

07:48.780 --> 07:51.600
Ponnie. She was...
She was right behind me.

07:51.710 --> 07:56.220
- Who's Bonnie?
- Ponnie! With a p. Pah-nee.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.140
What color was her hair?
Plond?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.900
Or prunnette?

08:09.130 --> 08:13.530
Ponnie, are you in here?
Ponnie?

08:13.770 --> 08:15.570
Ponnie, what happened?

08:15.610 --> 08:17.110
I went to introduce you to all my friends.

08:17.170 --> 08:19.240
And when I turned around, you were gone.

08:20.610 --> 08:21.990
Sinjin?

08:22.320 --> 08:24.440
This stall is taken.

08:29.470 --> 08:33.470
Anyone know where Ponnie is?

08:33.470 --> 08:37.470
Or why Sinjin is crying in the girls bathroom?!?

08:37.470 --> 08:39.500
Feeling: Confused.

08:44.970 --> 08:47.520
Ahhhhhh!!!

08:48.470 --> 08:53.340
- It's just me, Ponnie.
- But... how did...

08:53.380 --> 08:55.010
Well, I found your mask on the floor,

08:55.080 --> 08:56.510
so I thought I'd put it over my face...

08:56.580 --> 08:58.100
And then return it to you.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.380
Oh. Thanks.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.580
Hey, what happened to you at lunch?

09:04.620 --> 09:06.550
Sorry. It's just...

09:06.590 --> 09:07.850
I'm just really shy and I got nervous,

09:07.920 --> 09:10.660
and so I went and finished my
lunch in the janitor's closet.

09:12.190 --> 09:16.600
- Ewww, why there?
- 'Cuz it's safe and quiet.

09:16.630 --> 09:19.350
And I like the smell
of the cleaning products.

09:21.290 --> 09:24.240
But wouldn't you rather smell people?

09:29.910 --> 09:31.540
Oh, yeah.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.380
Listen, I gotta get to class.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.410
Yeah, we don't wanna be late for Sikowitz.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.720
You?
You're not in Sikowitz's class.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.660
- Uh-huh.
You probably never noticed me.

09:44.690 --> 09:47.780
I'm one of the quiet kids who sits in
the back and just reacts to stuff.

09:47.930 --> 09:49.740
You're a shrugger?

09:53.300 --> 09:54.530
Wow.

09:54.570 --> 09:57.370
Well, then, why don't we
walk to class together?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.200
- Owwww.
- What's wrong?

10:01.240 --> 10:04.440
I have severe shoulder pain.
From too much shrugging.

10:05.660 --> 10:09.270
Oh, then let me carry your backpack.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.210
Really?

10:11.360 --> 10:14.800
Wow, I guess this is what
it's like to have a friend.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.690
Yeaaahhhh, but you don't have
to touch my belly button.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.650
Oh, I don't mind.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.070
Ahhhhh!!! Oh!
She's right behind me!

10:31.100 --> 10:33.600
Please hide me!
She is gonna kill me!

10:33.640 --> 10:36.070
What?! Did you just say
that someone was going...

10:36.140 --> 10:38.870
Ah, you kids work it out yourselves.

10:39.230 --> 10:40.810
C'mon, Cat...
Just watch the door.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.530
And that way Jade can't sneak up on you.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.920
Okay. I'll just stay right here.
And I'll watch the door...

10:48.020 --> 10:51.490
- Aah!
- Whoa! Whoa!

10:51.520 --> 10:54.860
- Aah! Come here! No!
- Jade, whoa whoa! Watch it.

10:54.890 --> 10:56.560
- Someone...
- Don't do that!

10:56.600 --> 11:00.000
Danger, danger!
What are you... stop it!

11:00.030 --> 11:05.000
Hey! Cut it out! Hey!

11:06.440 --> 11:09.770
- You girls knock it off.
- I'll get you.

11:09.810 --> 11:11.480
I don't wanna be gotten!

11:14.180 --> 11:17.230
Alright, weirdos, take your seats.

11:21.220 --> 11:25.990
- Wait, where's Ponnie?
- Where's who?

11:26.030 --> 11:28.190
Ponnie, one of your students.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.320
She sits in the back with you guys, right?

11:30.470 --> 11:34.460
- There's no anybody in here.
- Oh, come on. She's one of you!

11:35.800 --> 11:39.210
Uh, Tori...
Maybe you should sit down and rest.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.370
There's no Ponnie in this class.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.840
- B-but... she told me...
Okay...

11:44.910 --> 11:49.280
Well, if there's no Ponnie, then
how do I have pennie's backpack?

11:49.320 --> 11:52.680
Hmmmm? Hmmmm?

11:52.720 --> 11:56.460
- What's in Ponnie's backpack?
- I don't know. Ponnie stuff.

11:57.870 --> 12:01.180
An ear of corn...

12:02.740 --> 12:07.150
A klingon dictionary...

12:07.940 --> 12:10.410
And a doll...

12:11.110 --> 12:13.230
That's dressed exactly like me.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.790
I'm talking Tori.
And I'm evil.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.550
What?!

12:20.750 --> 12:24.760
- Why would you buy that doll?
- And where do I get one?

12:25.920 --> 12:29.790
I didn't buy it!
This is Ponnie's backpack!

12:30.530 --> 12:35.800
- Sounds a little odd.
- There is no one named Ponnie in this school.

12:35.830 --> 12:38.450
It's true. No Ponnie.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.370
Okay. That does it.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.360
I am gonna find that Ponnie girl right now!

12:50.330 --> 12:54.880
Ponnie?! Ponnie?!
Ponnie?!

12:54.920 --> 12:57.850
Why was there corn in your backpack?!

12:58.860 --> 13:00.870
Ponnie?!

13:02.580 --> 13:05.930
M-make it... make it...

13:08.500 --> 13:11.970
Rah... rahhh....

13:12.000 --> 13:14.440
Sikowiiiiiiiiitz!!!!
Andreeee!!!!

13:37.930 --> 13:40.660
Come see!
It says make it rot!

13:40.700 --> 13:43.330
And I know Ponnie did it!
Look!

13:43.400 --> 13:48.120
See, my locker says make it shine!
Whaaaaaaaat?!?

13:53.020 --> 13:54.890
I am not crazy!

13:55.050 --> 13:57.950
I swear, my locker said
make it rot just a second ago!

13:57.980 --> 14:01.170
And Ponnie did it!
I know Ponnie did it!

14:02.690 --> 14:06.430
Is it just me, or is Tori a lot
hotter now that she's crazy?

14:12.980 --> 14:20.590
I'm not crazy! There is a Ponnie!!!

14:20.590 --> 14:22.530
Feeling: Frustrated.

14:22.950 --> 14:26.020
Look, Tori. I got you some
nice soothing herbal tea.

14:26.790 --> 14:31.150
And here are some pretty
magazines for you to look at.

14:31.590 --> 14:33.290
And I'm gonna sing you a littttle song.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.010
That'll make you feel calm and
maybe a little bit less insane.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.370
Listen to me!

14:39.400 --> 14:42.130
I swear, there is a girl named Ponnie!

14:42.170 --> 14:45.670
And she's intentionally trying to

17:48.260 --> 17:49.900
Feeling: Frazzled.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.950
Tori?

17:55.260 --> 17:56.690
What?

17:56.730 --> 17:59.800
It's three thirty in the morning.
Why are you up?

17:59.830 --> 18:06.500
- Why are you up?
- Oh. It's so thick and green!

18:06.540 --> 18:08.410
You look upset.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.510

Will you listen to me?

18:19.420 --> 18:23.020

What are you doing?!

18:39.700 --> 18:41.560
I was checking my email.

18:42.540 --> 18:44.640
Mom!!! I am talking to you!

18:44.670 --> 18:47.110
I'm scared that this girl at
school is gonna do something bad!

18:47.180 --> 18:49.740
Okay. Maybe we can...
Uhhh...

18:49.810 --> 18:52.010
We need cops...
When does dad get back in town?

18:52.080 --> 18:55.150
- Not 'til Sunday.
- Well, can't you call his partner?

18:55.180 --> 18:58.720
- Okay. I'll text Gary.
- Yeah, text Gary. I like that guy.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.240
- I know, he's handsome, right?
- Kinda.

19:09.090 --> 19:10.460
Bye.

19:21.010 --> 19:22.030
Well...

19:23.250 --> 19:27.340
It's just me, alone here in the hallway.

19:28.690 --> 19:30.980
No one else around.

19:45.940 --> 19:48.660
Ahhhhhh! Ahhhhhh!

19:52.150 --> 19:54.980
Come outta there!

19:59.940 --> 20:01.460
Thirsty, Tori?

20:02.860 --> 20:05.890
Who are you?!
What is your deal?!

20:06.490 --> 20:08.740
My name is Fawn Liebowitz.

20:09.060 --> 20:11.300
Well, I don't even know you!

20:11.330 --> 20:14.560
I used to go to school here.
... 'Til you showed up.

20:14.940 --> 20:19.030
- Huh?
- Your locker? Used to be my locker.

20:19.480 --> 20:23.250
Yeah. I got kicked outta Hollywood arts
so they could "make room" for you.

20:23.280 --> 20:28.090
And guess what, Tori...
I'm angry about it.

20:29.420 --> 20:34.390
Yeah? Well, you guess what!

20:39.420 --> 20:41.180
Ohhhh... whistle...

20:46.700 --> 20:49.010
Looking for this?

20:50.010 --> 20:52.730
How did you get my whistle ball?!

20:53.370 --> 20:57.310
The only thing you need to know
is, I belong at this school.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.310
Not you.
Me!

20:59.350 --> 21:03.290
I wanna make it shine.
It's my time to be!!!

21:04.390 --> 21:07.260
To be arrested!
Gary!

21:09.030 --> 21:10.390
Gary!!!

21:11.360 --> 21:15.100
- What happened?!
- What's going on?! Fawn Liebowitz?

21:15.130 --> 21:17.290
Ah, shut up, hippie.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.350
She never liked you.

21:21.140 --> 21:24.010
- You all right, kid?
- Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

21:24.040 --> 21:27.810
Sure. I'll text your mom.
Let her know you're okay.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.310
Good.

21:29.350 --> 21:31.860
She's a special lady.

21:33.820 --> 21:35.710
Thanks...?

21:36.920 --> 21:41.390
Noooo, she didn't get expelled from
Hollywood arts to make room here for you.

21:41.420 --> 21:46.330
- Then why did she get kicked out?
- She's crazy. A loony-bat.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.800
She stole things...
Carried weird stuff in her backpack...

21:49.830 --> 21:54.440
Called everyone Debbie.
A real nut case.

21:54.470 --> 21:57.210
Lick my loafers, Debbie.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.580
Hey, be careful with her!
She's a slippery one!

22:07.080 --> 22:09.550
I fell asleep during study hall.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.610
Jade found me.

22:14.590 --> 22:17.090
Aw, don't be sad little one.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.660
I think your head looks great like that.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.420
Of course, you do.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.470
Okay, kiddo.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.300
We're gonna take Fawn down
to the station and book her.

22:29.340 --> 22:30.940
She won't bother you again.

22:30.970 --> 22:33.380
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

22:33.410 --> 22:35.510
Uh Detective, she's pretty shaken up.

22:35.550 --> 22:38.450
Do you have an extra police officer
who could give her a ride home?

22:38.480 --> 22:40.580
- Sure thing.
- Oh, and can Trina come?

22:40.620 --> 22:42.650
She texted me, she said she has a fever.

22:42.690 --> 22:46.730
No problem. Just tell your
mom I send her my best.

22:47.990 --> 22:48.940
Okay.

22:50.220 --> 22:52.090
What a week.

22:56.070 --> 22:59.700
- Sorry.
- I don't even mind.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.080
