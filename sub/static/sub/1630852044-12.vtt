my favorite person right now.

34:02.107 --> 34:03.206
That's for sure.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.742
<i>But you know, I never let
feelings get in the way</i>

34:05.810 --> 34:09.379
of sales and commissions,
so why not bring him through.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.481
I'm kind of pumped
to show you this.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.283
<i>So have you been looking
for a long time?</i>

34:13.351 --> 34:14.417
- About a year and a half.

34:14.485 --> 34:15.685
Been looking
for the forever house.

34:15.753 --> 34:17.387
- Just a few months now,
not too long.

34:17.455 --> 34:19.656
Just looking at Newport
and down in Laguna, mostly.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.024
- Let me show you what this is

34:21.092 --> 34:22.292
all about 'cause this is insane.

34:22.359 --> 34:23.393
- Look at this.

34:23.461 --> 34:24.594
- It's incredible.

34:24.662 --> 34:26.196
You're, like,
on top of the water.

34:26.198 --> 34:27.530
- This took a long time
to build.

34:27.598 --> 34:29.432
Actually, 15 years
believe it or not.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.634
- Wow.

34:30.701 --> 34:32.503
- We're on the promontory tip
right here.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.637
So everything else
is behind you.

34:34.705 --> 34:36.073
- Where are you living
right now?

34:36.141 --> 34:37.240
- Corona Del Mar.

34:37.308 --> 34:38.708
- Oh, nice. CDM. I love CDM.

34:38.776 --> 34:43.113
<i>♪ ♪</i>

34:43.181 --> 34:44.681
<i>It's separated
on three different levels.</i>

34:44.749 --> 34:47.051
<i>You got three bedrooms
upstairs and two below.</i>

34:47.118 --> 34:48.284
<i>- It's amazing.</i>

34:48.286 --> 34:49.754
<i>- What type of business you in?</i>

34:49.820 --> 34:52.055
- I'm an entrepreneur.
I do a lot of venture capital,

34:52.122 --> 34:53.723
so I entertain a lot
and I have a lot of things

34:53.791 --> 34:55.459
so this house would be perfect
for that as well.

34:55.526 --> 34:57.393
- Oh, man. This would be
the best investment you do.

34:57.461 --> 34:59.330
- Yeah.
- This is the deal closer.

34:59.396 --> 35:00.530
- Absolutely.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.664
- I'm in the car business.

35:01.732 --> 35:03.400
- You are?
- Yeah.

35:03.402 --> 35:06.736
- I have, like, a crush on
being a salesperson for cars.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.172
- Come on over.
We'll give you a job.

35:08.238 --> 35:11.174
- Can I do that?
- Yeah, absolutely.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.809
So here, you've got
the primary suite.

35:12.811 --> 35:16.113
You know, typical open modern
floor plan, which is cool.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.681
- I love the tub in the shower.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.415
- Especially when you have
a floor like this, you know,

35:19.483 --> 35:20.884
you can get everything
wet over here

35:20.886 --> 35:22.485
and you don't have to worry
about the wood.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.621
You know, the price per
square foot on this property,

35:24.623 --> 35:26.255
do you think it's a little high?

35:26.324 --> 35:29.226
- Look, it did take 15 years
to build this so we factor

35:29.293 --> 35:31.294
that into the price.
If you look at it

35:31.296 --> 35:34.564
as just a pure price
per square foot basis,

35:34.632 --> 35:36.366
it can be argued
that could be aggressive,

35:36.433 --> 35:38.501
but at the end of the day,
it's an inventory issue.

35:38.569 --> 35:41.438
So, like, I don't know what
else you can get for that price

35:41.505 --> 35:42.840
that's brand new right now.

35:42.907 --> 35:47.444
To find a new construction
house on a cliff in Laguna

35:47.446 --> 35:50.480
is like finding a lucky penny.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.583
<i>Move-in ready equals
higher price per square foot</i>

35:53.585 --> 35:56.653
and turnkey
is what people right now.

35:56.655 --> 36:00.157
<i>So the views from every room
are super iconic.</i>

36:00.225 --> 36:01.225
Come on down here.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.593
<i>I'll show you
my favorite part of the house.</i>

36:03.661 --> 36:04.462
So you got the hot tub.

36:04.528 --> 36:06.663
You have a great outdoor
grilling area.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.464
You have multiple
grilling areas over here.

36:08.532 --> 36:09.532
And to have this

36:09.600 --> 36:11.801
and to have a nice flat
piece of land, it's great.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.270
- This is what it's all about.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.871
<i>- The views don't get better
than this.</i>

36:14.939 --> 36:16.340
- Yeah, I'll be in touch.
- Yeah, let me know.

36:16.407 --> 36:17.608
- As of right now seriously
if you want it.

36:17.675 --> 36:18.808
- Sounds great.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.777
- Next time,
cue the whales, okay?

36:20.844 --> 36:22.545
- All right. Bye, guys.

36:22.613 --> 36:24.314
- Hello.
- Yo.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.683
- Wow, that's a view.

36:26.685 --> 36:27.684
- This is the ship.

36:27.752 --> 36:30.254
- Look at us. OC man.

36:30.320 --> 36:33.623
- I think we had to switch out
the suits for the pastels.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.757
Ain't it fun down here.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.226
- I was just saying that
to my sister.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.496
Water is bluer,
trees are greener,

36:38.562 --> 36:41.164
the brokers are nicer,
the sunshine.

36:41.232 --> 36:43.167
- No, I love it.
How much is this?

36:43.234 --> 36:45.235
- So we just hit
the market for 25.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.370
- Okay. Show me around.

36:46.437 --> 36:47.570
- Yeah, man.

36:47.638 --> 36:51.175
So we got about 5,000 feet,
five beds, seven baths.

36:51.242 --> 36:52.742
- What is the light fixture?
Interesting.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.711
- It's an art installation
but also a light.

36:54.778 --> 36:56.980
- It looks like--do you
do popcorn

36:56.982 --> 36:58.715
in the microwave with your kids?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.450
You know those popcorn bags
you then cut up--

37:00.452 --> 37:01.484
- I can see how--

37:01.552 --> 37:03.453
- And they just burn
from one side like the paper.

37:03.521 --> 37:05.355
- Yes. I can see how
some people will like it.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.657
Some will want something
kind of more substantial there.

37:07.725 --> 37:11.662
- These are, like, really cool.
Like a Swedish snow globe.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.363
- So this is the primary.
- Yeah. Okay.

37:14.432 --> 37:17.201
I mean,
this is California lifestyle.

37:17.268 --> 37:20.737
- Every room as you can see
here has a incredible view.

37:20.804 --> 37:23.273
<i>- Wow. The water,
the modern architecture.</i>

37:23.340 --> 37:24.874
<i>I can even see
in here the birds.</i>

37:24.942 --> 37:27.443
- I'll show you downstairs.
The outside is insane.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.412
But the ceilings aren't,
like, that tall.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.149
- Well, you're also 7 feet tall
so for me, they're pretty tall.

37:32.216 --> 37:34.484
- I'm actually quite normal
in Sweden.

37:34.551 --> 37:35.818
- Yeah, that's perfect.

37:35.886 --> 37:38.021
- Cool, right?
It's a pretty iconic view.

37:38.088 --> 37:39.556
- It really is.

37:39.558 --> 37:43.827
- Speaking of icon,
congrats on the award.

37:43.829 --> 37:46.763
- The Element Award?
- The Icon Award.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.498
I don't participate
in the rankings

37:48.565 --> 37:51.000
'cause I can't because
I run too large of a team.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.902
<i>But Douglas Elliman gave us</i>

37:52.970 --> 37:54.671

37:55.908 --> 37:57.707
<i>which is called the Icon Award.</i>

37:57.709 --> 37:59.842
- There's been a ton of talk
around the office

37:59.910 --> 38:01.512
about this Icon Award.
It's like--

38:01.578 --> 38:02.580
- What? What talk?

38:02.646 --> 38:03.914
- What was the whole deal
with it?

38:03.981 --> 38:05.281
- You're asking me?

38:05.349 --> 38:06.450
- Yeah.
- Ask the company.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.051
What--what--it's the deal.

38:08.118 --> 38:10.653
- My point--my point is this.
I'm all about the rankings

38:10.721 --> 38:12.456
just because I feel like
we're in a business

38:12.523 --> 38:15.693
where that's how you're
measured is by rankings, right?

38:15.759 --> 38:18.761
Like this is a super
competitive sales environment.

38:18.829 --> 38:21.731
You're the number one
or you're not number one.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.866
- Or you're not anything.
Maybe you're iconic.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.068
Like what--what I mean.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.737
- Look, I was the number
one agent in Douglas Elliman

38:26.804 --> 38:28.004

this year.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.405
I take pride in that.

38:29.473 --> 38:30.673
- Congratulations
to your award too.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.309
- No, I appreciate it.

38:32.311 --> 38:35.578
Being the number one Douglas
Elliman agent in the country,

38:35.646 --> 38:39.549
<i>it means a huge amount
to my brand and my reputation</i>

38:39.617 --> 38:42.886

Fredrik's award
it's--it's a sham.

38:45.622 --> 38:48.624
I felt it was kind of bizarre
because I had heard

38:48.692 --> 38:50.894

that your CEO, Julia.

38:50.961 --> 38:52.361

38:52.363 --> 38:53.629
- Called the executives.

38:53.697 --> 38:56.400

38:59.570 --> 39:00.937

39:02.639 --> 39:04.541
- Right. So you wanted

"Can you believe what he did?"
Like, it's embarrassing.

39:38.742 --> 39:41.744
So I'm actually asking him
because he should be aware

39:41.812 --> 39:44.013
that everybody's talking
about him behind his back.

39:44.081 --> 39:45.681
- It wasn't an award we wanted

39:45.749 --> 39:47.550
but we wanted
to be recognized somehow.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.620
You see, when we removed
ourselves from the ranking

39:49.686 --> 39:51.955
and I'm saying the smiling
because it's so silly

39:51.957 --> 39:53.489

We sat down...

39:53.557 --> 39:55.091
- Right.
- With the owner of the company

39:55.159 --> 39:56.893
and we said we want to expand.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.694
I want to go to Texas.
I want to go to L.A.

39:58.762 --> 40:00.630
I might even move there.
Miami.

We were, like, 11 at the time.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.974
And every time
there was a ranking,

40:11.041 --> 40:13.376
we had to cut one person.
It was a whole thing.

40:13.444 --> 40:16.580
And then yes, we decided
to never be ranked again.

40:16.647 --> 40:19.849
And five years later, yes,
I wanted some sort of

it's recognition for my team.

40:33.897 --> 40:35.998

It's not about number 1, 2, 3,
4, better than anybody else.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.808
It's just that
we actually exist.

40:45.876 --> 40:48.077
Some developers,
some sellers get confused.

40:48.145 --> 40:50.079

but where Fredrik and his team?

40:54.184 --> 40:58.854
And it just didn't feel right
when we are clearly so big.

40:58.923 --> 41:02.626
- The fact that he admitted
that he asked for an award

41:02.693 --> 41:04.827
<i>to be made up for him,</i>

41:04.895 --> 41:10.033

41:10.035 --> 41:11.834
that do submit their numbers.

41:11.902 --> 41:13.503
There's so many words
that, like,

41:13.505 --> 41:16.772

Oh, that's my respect level.

It's like, I got my award
'cause I earned it,

41:22.980 --> 41:25.716
but Fredrik still feels
like he needs to have his

41:25.782 --> 41:28.617
and then had your office
call the executive

41:28.686 --> 41:30.086
to make up an award for you.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.855
- But we are the top

- I don't know who you are
'cause you're not on that list.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.794
- You should celebrate being
number one in the company.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.195
- It's not about that.

41:39.263 --> 41:40.497
It's about the fact
that you're taking away...

41:40.565 --> 41:41.597
- What is it about?

41:41.665 --> 41:42.800
- What I accomplished this year.

41:42.866 --> 41:43.867
- I take away--

41:43.934 --> 41:45.201
- Number one agent
in the country

41:45.269 --> 41:46.670
for some fakakta award.
Come on.

41:46.737 --> 41:47.804
- Josh.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.006

but the calling in thing

41:50.074 --> 41:51.641

Fredrik, it's bullsh--.

41:53.144 --> 41:54.210

41:54.212 --> 41:55.845
- I think you think is bullsh--

41:55.847 --> 41:57.680
That I'm here and getting
any kind of recognition.

41:57.682 --> 41:59.082
- Clearly, I don't.
I've been number one

41:59.149 --> 42:00.883
every year I've been
at Douglas Elliman in L.A.

42:00.885 --> 42:02.820
There's no bullsh--
Don't go out there

42:02.886 --> 42:05.154
and say you're number one when
you're not in the rankings.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.523
- Did I say that I'm number one.

42:06.591 --> 42:07.524
- You did.

42:07.591 --> 42:09.826
It was a--it was
a backward slap in the face,

42:09.828 --> 42:12.762
whatever you want to call it.
Fredrik is an icon like--

42:12.829 --> 42:13.963
- I am an icon.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.631
- Yeah, you're icon.

42:15.699 --> 42:17.533
You're the biggest ----ing
broker I've ever seen.

42:17.601 --> 42:19.435
You're--you're 8 feet tall.
You're an icon, all right?

42:19.503 --> 42:22.840
- I feel like I can't do
anything right with him.

42:22.906 --> 42:25.642
It doesn't matter what I do.
There's something about me.

42:25.709 --> 42:29.646
<i>But he has mentioned now many
times that I'm so tall.</i>

42:29.713 --> 42:30.848
I'm wearing this thing,

42:30.914 --> 42:32.182
it's like,
you know, holding me up.

42:32.249 --> 42:33.784
- I like that.

42:33.850 --> 42:34.985
Maybe that's, like,
something you should wear.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.519
- Maybe something
you should wear.

42:36.586 --> 42:37.854
- Yeah, I should.
I need the extra inches.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.188
You don't need the extra inches.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.858
- How high are these ceilings?
- 12 feet.

42:40.924 --> 42:43.059
- I think they're more
like 10'5", 11.

42:43.126 --> 42:44.561
- Oh, that's 'cause you're a
little closer

42:44.629 --> 42:45.528
to them, Fredrik,

42:45.530 --> 42:47.197
It's crazy. When I started
in this business,

42:47.264 --> 42:52.802
I was Fredrik's height.
Now I'm--now I'm 5'9" 1/2.

42:52.869 --> 42:56.705
- Maybe I'm taller. Maybe I'm,
you know, do too many deals.

42:56.774 --> 42:59.075
<i>Maybe I'm just annoying.
And somehow</i>

42:59.077 --> 43:01.611
he thinks in his mind
that I'm provoking him.

43:01.678 --> 43:03.680
- I wanted to get it off
my chest 'cause I do think

43:03.747 --> 43:06.215
that we were actually headed
in the right direction.

43:06.283 --> 43:07.750
I just like--now I know

43:07.818 --> 43:10.087
it's like Fredrik
Backhand Compliment Eklund.

43:10.153 --> 43:11.688
- What do you want me to do?
- You get--what?

43:11.755 --> 43:13.022
I don't know
what you want to do.

43:13.090 --> 43:14.223
It's all good, man.

43:14.225 --> 43:16.159
I hope you enjoy the Icon Award.

43:16.161 --> 43:17.693
- Wow. Okay.

43:17.761 --> 43:20.062
Well, this was nice.
I think you're going to sell it

43:20.130 --> 43:22.232
'cause you're the number one
and the best.

43:22.299 --> 43:25.669
<i>- Next time on "Million Dollar
Listing Los Angeles"...</i>

43:25.671 --> 43:27.637
- Hoo-hoo-hoo!
<i>- This is insane.</i>

43:27.704 --> 43:29.172
<i>What's the square footage?
- 20,000.</i>

43:29.239 --> 43:31.107
- I'm like a kid
in a candy store.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.042
Give me the tour. I don't know
who's gonna buy this,

43:33.110 --> 43:35.579
but I can tell you one thing's
for sure, they're wealthy.

43:35.646 --> 43:36.979
And you haven't signed
with anybody yet?

43:37.047 --> 43:38.749
- Not yet.

43:38.815 --> 43:42.918
- Gleb is on "Dancing with
The Stars," and he and his wife

43:42.986 --> 43:44.254
are in the process
of selling their house.

43:44.321 --> 43:46.989
So I popped over there and well,

43:46.991 --> 43:50.694
the tenant trashed the place,
so I have ten days

43:50.760 --> 43:52.194
to get it ready for market.

43:52.262 --> 43:53.497
- What?
- Wow!

43:53.563 --> 43:56.032
- It looks so good, right?
- Oh, my God.

43:56.099 --> 43:57.167
- Goodness.

43:57.234 --> 44:01.604
- Sell the house, da, da, da,

44:01.672 --> 44:02.938
and little pivot, pivot, pivot,
and a dip.

44:03.006 --> 44:04.406
Both: Whoo!

44:04.408 --> 44:06.108
- What were you doing
on Nightingale?

44:06.110 --> 44:07.810
- James, I happen
to be a really good cook.

44:07.878 --> 44:10.647
- It's not a cookout.
It's a $30-million listing.

44:10.714 --> 44:12.648
Rock and roll, baby.
Now we flip them.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.218
- This whole place is
smoked out right now.

44:15.285 --> 44:18.087
- Only ----ed up 12 minutes
before everybody arrives

44:18.089 --> 44:20.890
and we looked like
a couple of ---holes.
