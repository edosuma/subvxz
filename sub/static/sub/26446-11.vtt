WEBVTT

00:04.026 --> 00:07.061
All right, guys. A year ago today,

00:07.062 --> 00:11.399
we lost an incredible mother,
incredible wife and a friend.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.068
Uh, so to remember her,
I got her favorite food:

00:14.069 --> 00:16.437
shrimp fried rice.

00:18.641 --> 00:21.275
Boy, are you crazy?
It's 9:30 in the morning.

00:21.277 --> 00:23.578
Ain't nobody gonna eat
no shrimp fried rice this early.

00:24.847 --> 00:26.748
Yeah, yeah,
when did you even get this?

00:26.749 --> 00:27.915
I got it yesterday.

00:27.916 --> 00:29.917
Ew. Yesterday?

00:29.918 --> 00:31.719
Look, Nancy was like a mother to me,

00:31.720 --> 00:34.021
but I'm not eating no day-old
shrimp for breakfast.

00:34.023 --> 00:36.290
Nat, this is supposed to be
a day of celebration.

00:36.292 --> 00:38.203
How you gonna celebrate when
you're throwing up all day,

00:38.227 --> 00:40.762
- trying not to die?
- Okay, look.

00:40.763 --> 00:43.097
If y'all gonna waste
my shrimp fried rice...

00:43.098 --> 00:46.100
which I refrigerated properly,
by the way...

00:46.101 --> 00:47.802
we gonna move on to memory sharing.

00:47.803 --> 00:49.414
I read in a book that
it can be actually therapeutic

00:49.438 --> 00:50.715
to, you know, grieve as a group.

00:50.739 --> 00:52.340
So I got this box with...

00:54.043 --> 00:55.676
There's pictures of Mom in it, man...

00:55.678 --> 00:58.045
Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey. No tears.

00:58.047 --> 01:00.047
Look, this is a celebration,
all right?

01:00.049 --> 01:02.350
We're all just gonna smile.
I said smile.

01:04.420 --> 01:06.988
Dad, I mean, I see you go
through this box every night.

01:06.989 --> 01:08.456
You know, you think I'm asleep.

01:08.457 --> 01:10.925
Oh, you a Peeping Tom now?

01:10.926 --> 01:12.704
Dad, just because you're
uncomfortable having emotions

01:12.728 --> 01:14.962
in front of other people,
that don't mean that you can

01:14.963 --> 01:16.931
rain on our parade, man.
I mean, we grieving.

01:16.932 --> 01:18.543
Oh, I am not uncomfortable
having emotions, all right?

01:18.567 --> 01:21.469
I'm having an emotion right now,
called irritation.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.638
Look, look, look. Look, guys. Look.

01:23.639 --> 01:26.474
Let's just stop giving
each other a hard time, okay?

01:26.475 --> 01:28.420
Look, I'm gonna remember Mom the
way I remember her every day.

01:28.444 --> 01:30.744
I mean, she's in my heart,
and, you know, I've processed

01:30.946 --> 01:33.414
her passing in my own way.
You know, I-I'm-I'm good.

01:33.415 --> 01:36.484
Well, Dad's not. He claims
he's never even cried about Mom.

01:36.485 --> 01:38.085
Oh, no, hold up now.

01:38.087 --> 01:40.131
My generation and every
generation before me? Strong.

01:40.155 --> 01:41.689
Y'all remember the movie <i>Gladiator?</i>

01:43.092 --> 01:44.892
They killed his whole family.
What'd he do?

01:44.893 --> 01:47.028
He went out in a field,
screamed one time.

01:49.031 --> 01:50.832
Basically, he was good after that.

01:50.833 --> 01:53.634
I did the same thing. I was at
work, I was kind of feeling it.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.113
Lunchtime, went outside,
and I screamed,

01:55.137 --> 01:57.171
and I've been amazing ever since.

01:58.774 --> 02:00.374
Dad, you not a gladiator.

02:00.376 --> 02:01.776
Oh, I'm not a gladiator?

02:04.513 --> 02:07.515
Feel stupid as hell
right now, don't you?

02:07.516 --> 02:09.851

02:32.174 --> 02:35.610
<i>Just called to let you know I'm

<i>Miss you. Love you.</i>

03:04.306 --> 03:06.541
Hey.

03:06.542 --> 03:08.376
Rel, you okay?

03:08.377 --> 03:12.179
Since when did you just start
walking into my apartment?

03:12.181 --> 03:15.349
All the time.

03:15.350 --> 03:17.385
What-what do you want?

03:17.386 --> 03:19.487
I left my phone.

03:26.462 --> 03:29.030
- Look, Rel, I miss your mom, too.
- Hey! Hey!

03:29.031 --> 03:31.065
Okay, she wasn't your mom, all right?

03:31.066 --> 03:33.501
She was my mom.

03:33.502 --> 03:35.079
So you don't know
what I'm going through, okay?

03:35.103 --> 03:36.771
Matter of fact, just get out of here.

03:36.772 --> 03:38.450
This your phone right here?
Just-just leave, okay?

03:38.474 --> 03:40.107
Excuse me?

03:40.108 --> 03:42.343
Look, you being real rude,
and it's pissing me off.

03:42.344 --> 03:44.979
But because I have a firm rule
that I don't smack people

03:44.980 --> 03:47.648
on the anniversary of the day
their mother died...

03:49.418 --> 03:51.118
...I'm-a smack your ass tomorrow.

03:52.888 --> 03:54.889
Hey, Britt, Britt.

03:54.890 --> 03:57.458
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look, I'm...

03:57.459 --> 04:01.562
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I-I'm...

04:01.563 --> 04:03.664
I'm struggling.

04:05.634 --> 04:07.702
Look, I know. It's all right.

04:09.171 --> 04:11.872
If you don't want to talk to me,
that's fine, Rel.

04:11.874 --> 04:14.342
But you need to talk to somebody.

04:14.343 --> 04:16.711
Maybe you should see a therapist.

04:16.712 --> 04:20.047
You know black people
don't see no therapists.

04:20.048 --> 04:22.550
That's not true. Metta World
Peace thanked his therapist

04:22.551 --> 04:24.318
when he won the finals.

04:24.319 --> 04:27.855
Charlamagne tha God talks about
mental health all the time.

04:27.856 --> 04:30.458
Speaking of God,
Oprah advocates therapy.

04:30.459 --> 04:33.294
See, all those people are rich, okay?

04:33.295 --> 04:35.763
I don't know any normal people
that go to therapy.

04:35.764 --> 04:39.333
Rel, normal people
go to therapy all the time.

04:39.334 --> 04:41.836
I go to therapy.

04:41.837 --> 04:43.504
You see a therapist?

04:43.505 --> 04:46.607
I know at first, it seems weird
to tell a stranger

04:46.608 --> 04:48.275
all your darkest secrets.

04:48.277 --> 04:51.278
But after a while, you know,
it's very freeing.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.582
It's like having
an emotional prostitute.

04:57.152 --> 04:59.320
I'm not gonna lie, that...

04:59.321 --> 05:01.822
that actually just sounds
like a regular prostitute.

05:05.093 --> 05:06.905
Okay, look, what if I say
something stupid, right?

05:06.929 --> 05:08.362
And she start laughing at me?

05:08.363 --> 05:10.331
She is not gonna laugh at you.

05:10.332 --> 05:13.501
Okay, well, what if I say
something funny, then? Huh?

05:13.502 --> 05:15.603
Is she gonna suppress her laugh?

05:16.738 --> 05:19.140
See, I don't like
her attitude already.

05:19.141 --> 05:21.208
You ain't even meet her yet.

05:21.209 --> 05:24.445
See, this feel like a mistake.
You know what I'm saying to you?

05:24.446 --> 05:27.648
Matter of fact, what if
she fall in love with me?

05:28.817 --> 05:30.818
Rel, what are you talking about?

05:30.819 --> 05:33.487
I'm saying, I'm-a go in there,
I'm-a lay on that couch, right?

05:33.488 --> 05:36.123
And she gonna just start looking
at me deep in my eyes, right?

05:36.124 --> 05:37.858
She's gonna be checking out

05:37.859 --> 05:41.929
all this sexy
chocolate-ness with glasses.

05:41.930 --> 05:45.566
Rel, trust me. She is not gonna
fall in love with you.

05:45.567 --> 05:48.169
Oh, so she thinks
she better than me now?

05:48.170 --> 05:50.905
You know something? I ain't got
time for this. I'm out of here.

05:50.906 --> 05:52.773
Sit down.

05:52.774 --> 05:54.619
You're not leaving.
You're gonna go in that room,

05:54.643 --> 05:56.343
and you're gonna spill your guts.

05:56.345 --> 05:59.046
She's gonna react appropriately,
like she supposed to.

05:59.047 --> 06:01.649
And when you leave,
you will not only feel better,

06:01.650 --> 06:03.194
but you gonna tell her I referred you

06:03.218 --> 06:05.019
so I can get my 15% off.

06:06.188 --> 06:08.556
Argyle McClaine?

06:11.627 --> 06:13.627
What are you doing?

06:13.629 --> 06:15.262
I'm Argyle McClaine.

06:15.263 --> 06:18.399
Uh-uh. If this gonna work,
you need to be honest.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.435
His name is Rel, he's in pain,
and I referred him.

06:25.173 --> 06:27.441
Mr. McClaine, come on in.

06:27.442 --> 06:30.111
Okay, you don't have to call me
Mr. McClaine. Just call me Rel.

06:30.112 --> 06:32.012
Okay, Rel.

06:32.014 --> 06:34.515
Now, look, I know what
the HIPAA laws are, right?

06:34.516 --> 06:36.661
You're not supposed to talk
about anything we discuss.

06:36.685 --> 06:39.186
But I need you to say that to my face.

06:39.187 --> 06:42.223
Okay, there are doctor-patient
confidentiality laws

06:42.224 --> 06:44.892
that if I break,
I could lose my license.

06:46.094 --> 06:48.429
Okay.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.765
Well, uh,

06:50.766 --> 06:53.901
I killed an Uber driver yesterday.

06:56.438 --> 06:58.139
Um, I...

06:58.140 --> 07:00.418
See, exactly. Look at your face.
See, I didn't kill nobody.

07:00.442 --> 07:03.010
Look at you. You're already
about to tell on me.

07:03.011 --> 07:06.147
I'm required to tell
if it's about a murder.

07:06.148 --> 07:10.484
All right, look, I'm just trying
to figure out the rules.

07:10.485 --> 07:13.154
Rel, this is a safe space.

07:13.155 --> 07:14.922
We could talk about hypotheticals,

07:14.923 --> 07:16.891
and that would be fine,

07:16.892 --> 07:20.127
or we can talk about
what's truly bothering you.

07:22.197 --> 07:24.999
I don't know, look, I...

07:25.000 --> 07:29.470
I was selfish, I was a coward,
and I did a horrible thing.

07:29.471 --> 07:32.039
And what was that?

07:33.175 --> 07:35.509
Look, my mom, right? Um...

07:37.279 --> 07:40.147
She called me before she went to
the hospital for the last time,

07:40.148 --> 07:44.151
and I didn't answer.
I didn't even call her back.

07:44.152 --> 07:49.290
She fell into a coma,
and she was gone that weekend.

07:49.291 --> 07:51.926
I wasn't there for her.

07:51.927 --> 07:55.729
Well, you know,
life is sometimes busy, Rel.

07:55.731 --> 07:59.567
And we don't know how important
a moment is until it's gone.

07:59.568 --> 08:01.435
See, but that's not what
it was about, okay?

08:01.436 --> 08:03.737
I wasn't busy, right?
I was just tired.

08:03.739 --> 08:07.007
I was tired of being sad, I was
tired of talking about cancer,

08:07.008 --> 08:09.376
and all I wanted to do was just

08:09.377 --> 08:11.745
sit around the house and watch TV.

08:14.382 --> 08:17.051
I thought I had more time. It...

08:17.052 --> 08:19.520
happened so fast.

08:19.521 --> 08:21.622
I'm sorry.

08:28.463 --> 08:30.898
I mean, is that... is that it?

08:30.899 --> 08:33.100
You just say sorry? I mean...

08:33.101 --> 08:37.004
I was just giving you a moment.
But I think I can help you.

08:37.005 --> 08:39.773
Well, if you can help me,
start helping. Okay?

08:39.775 --> 08:43.477
You got me here all broken up.
I need help. Help me.

08:47.993 --> 08:50.399
Jake, this is a happy day.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.700
A day of celebration.

08:51.701 --> 08:53.635
So I think I want
my wife's favorite drink:

08:53.636 --> 08:55.670
a Chardonnay with one ice cube.

08:55.672 --> 08:57.906
Coming right up.
And since it's a special drink,

08:57.907 --> 09:00.108
I'm-a give you a fresh ice cube.

09:00.109 --> 09:02.411
'Cause most of the ice in here
is old as hell.

09:02.412 --> 09:04.913
Yeah, back in '98, they had
a big ice sale, so I bought

09:04.914 --> 09:07.015
20 years worth of ice.

09:10.153 --> 09:12.354
Oh, hey, Pop.

09:12.355 --> 09:14.790
Damn, Nat, why you keep
stalking me with that box?

09:14.791 --> 09:17.269
When I put you out the car, say,
"Check the windshield wiper,"

09:17.293 --> 09:20.495
and I left you,
that was me ditching you.

09:22.465 --> 09:25.400
Look, I'm sorry, Dad, man, look,
I'm just worried about you.

09:25.401 --> 09:27.335
You can't keep
your emotions bottled up.

09:27.337 --> 09:29.004
I feel like if you don't open up, man,

09:29.005 --> 09:30.215
you're gonna end up killing somebody.

09:30.239 --> 09:32.507
It's probably gonna be you.

09:32.508 --> 09:34.219
You got to expose yourself
to the memories, okay?

09:34.243 --> 09:37.312
Let your emotions run their course.

09:37.313 --> 09:39.381
I found this picture of you and Mom

09:39.382 --> 09:42.150
in your matching jean jackets.

09:42.151 --> 09:45.020
Hmm?

09:48.925 --> 09:52.194
Dad, I know it's tough, man, but
you got to look at the picture

09:52.195 --> 09:54.729
so you can process.

09:54.731 --> 09:57.365
Nat, I processed it, okay?

09:57.367 --> 09:59.634
I'm a warrior, son.

10:01.137 --> 10:04.105
I'm here to celebrate, okay?

10:04.107 --> 10:07.042
Mm. Great ice cube, Jake.

10:08.044 --> 10:09.744
Come on, Dad.

10:09.746 --> 10:12.080
Look, you used to wear
this jean jacket all the time

10:12.081 --> 10:13.949
before Mom passed.
Now you never wear it.

10:13.950 --> 10:16.585
- Just talk to me, man.
- Look, it's just a jean jacket.

10:16.586 --> 10:18.386
I don't even think about it like that.

10:18.388 --> 10:21.923
And you just messed up my whole day.

10:21.924 --> 10:23.325
Pop?

10:23.326 --> 10:25.160
- Pop, I ruined...
- Yo, Nat.

10:25.161 --> 10:26.595
Nat, come here, man.

10:26.596 --> 10:28.864
Come here, man.

10:28.865 --> 10:33.235
Look, bro, your father left
without paying for his drink.

10:39.041 --> 10:41.376
So you owe me ten dollars, playboy.

10:44.247 --> 10:46.114
She was the glue to our family, right?

10:46.115 --> 10:47.593
She-she the one that kept
everything together.

10:47.617 --> 10:49.417
Kept all of us together.

10:49.419 --> 10:51.920
And when my brother was locked
up, she went and visited him

10:51.921 --> 10:53.455
any time they would let her,

10:53.456 --> 10:55.524
and my dad and her,
they used to sit up all night

10:55.525 --> 10:57.025
just laughing and talking.

10:57.026 --> 10:58.493
You know, she was the first person

10:58.494 --> 11:00.328
that held my babies
when they were born.

11:02.064 --> 11:04.232
My mom would just listen
to whatever I had to say.

11:04.233 --> 11:06.768
No matter how silly or small it was.

11:08.371 --> 11:10.939
And the one time she needed me,
I wasn't there.

11:12.608 --> 11:14.676
I just wish I can...

11:16.345 --> 11:18.446
...wish I could
talk to her, uh...

11:18.448 --> 11:20.582
and-and apologize.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.717
Why can't you?

11:24.454 --> 11:25.921
Well, I don't know if you heard

11:25.922 --> 11:28.123
the beginning of the story...
she's dead.

11:32.862 --> 11:34.296
Okay.

11:34.297 --> 11:36.665
Let's do an exercise.

11:36.666 --> 11:41.369
Picture that this is your mom.

11:41.370 --> 11:42.704
Talk to her.

11:44.373 --> 11:46.841
Okay.

11:46.843 --> 11:49.444
Um...

11:49.445 --> 11:51.123
Okay, look, that's just weird.
I can't do this.

11:51.147 --> 11:52.414
This is not my thing.

11:52.415 --> 11:54.082
Rel.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.918
I just want you to know
you can move beyond this.

11:56.919 --> 11:58.687
Just because she's passed doesn't mean

11:58.688 --> 12:01.222
you can't still feel connected to her.

12:02.758 --> 12:04.459
Is there a place

12:04.460 --> 12:07.662
that particularly reminds you
of your mother?

12:08.631 --> 12:09.998
Bennigan's.

12:09.999 --> 12:11.499
The restaurant?

12:11.501 --> 12:13.201
Yeah, we would, um...

12:13.202 --> 12:15.036
we would go there every Friday,
you know,

12:15.037 --> 12:16.504
after school, just me and her.

12:16.506 --> 12:18.206
Just our own time.

12:18.207 --> 12:21.209
I mean, they had a special booth
and everything.

12:21.210 --> 12:23.055
It was funny, my mom used
to get the bill every week,

12:23.079 --> 12:24.857
and it'd be the same exact
amount, but she still had

12:24.881 --> 12:27.192
an irritated face looking at
the bill like it's a new price.

12:29.819 --> 12:32.354
I mean, we would just sit there and...

12:32.355 --> 12:34.089
just laugh for hours.

12:36.025 --> 12:38.593
I haven't been
to that place since she passed.

12:39.762 --> 12:41.363
Well, why not go back?

12:41.364 --> 12:44.032
Maybe being in the place
that you associate

12:44.033 --> 12:47.869
so heavily with her will help
you engage with your emotions.

12:47.870 --> 12:50.405
Lot of feelings will probably
come up for you.

12:50.406 --> 12:53.174
But you can also gain
a greater understanding

12:53.175 --> 12:55.243
of what you really need.

12:55.244 --> 12:57.212
Thank you. You know something?
Maybe I will.

12:57.213 --> 12:58.780
Good.

12:58.781 --> 13:02.150
Okay. Well, we still have
ten minutes left.

13:05.087 --> 13:08.189
I mean, is there anything
you want to let off your chest?

13:19.135 --> 13:20.835
Hello, sir. By yourself?

13:20.836 --> 13:22.136
- Yeah, yeah. Just one.
- Okay.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.875
Hey, do you... do you mind
if I take this booth right here?

13:26.876 --> 13:28.309
- Sure.
- Thanks.

13:36.285 --> 13:37.686
Hey, baby.

13:39.355 --> 13:41.156
Mom?

13:41.157 --> 13:44.125
You got the good booth.

13:46.282 --> 13:47.382
_ _

13:48.955 --> 13:51.323
Hi, sweetie.

13:51.324 --> 13:55.199
Okay, are you... are you really here,

13:55.200 --> 13:58.369
or... am I sitting alone at a booth,

13:58.370 --> 14:01.071
looking crazy talking to myself?

14:01.072 --> 14:03.240
Not as crazy as you looked
this morning

14:03.241 --> 14:05.075
throwing that pillow around.

14:05.076 --> 14:06.911
You saw that?

14:06.912 --> 14:10.881
Baby, I can see everything.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.787
- Uh, e-everything?
- Mm-hmm.

14:16.788 --> 14:20.724
Don't worry, I close my eyes
for the disgusting parts.

14:20.725 --> 14:23.093
Also, you need to wash
your sheets more.

14:23.094 --> 14:25.129
Boy, I did not raise you that way.

14:28.099 --> 14:30.134
Look, Mom, it's-it's, um...

14:30.135 --> 14:32.069
there's something
I want to say to you.

14:32.070 --> 14:33.404
Um...

14:34.306 --> 14:36.607
The last time you called...

14:36.608 --> 14:38.242
I'm sorry I didn't answer the phone

14:38.243 --> 14:40.277
or didn't call you back, I...

14:41.847 --> 14:43.948
- I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.
- Son.

14:43.949 --> 14:46.984
I didn't like seeing
myself sick, either.

14:48.286 --> 14:50.521
You know, I still got the...

14:50.522 --> 14:52.456
you know I still got the voice mail?

14:52.457 --> 14:54.224
Uh, I listen to it almost every day.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.570
I-I didn't know you was gonna...

14:55.594 --> 14:58.228
Look, I know
that you think you're here

14:58.230 --> 15:01.565
because you want me to forgive you.

15:01.566 --> 15:05.369
But really, you need
to forgive yourself.

15:06.371 --> 15:08.439
I know you love me.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.275
I've always known.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.446
- You ready to order, sir?
- Uh, yeah.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.314
Um...

15:17.315 --> 15:19.883
uh, let me do
the loaded nachos and hot wings.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.285
Thank you.

15:21.286 --> 15:24.188
Two appetizers?

15:24.189 --> 15:27.257
It's a good thing
I'm not paying this time.

15:29.861 --> 15:32.696
I'm so afraid.

15:32.697 --> 15:34.999
I feel like everything is...
just went wrong.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.534
My marriage failed, and...

15:37.536 --> 15:39.837
and the kids are in Cleveland.

15:41.039 --> 15:42.873
And I thought you would still be here.

15:48.179 --> 15:49.647
It's just not fair, you know?

15:49.648 --> 15:50.914
Baby.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.617
Life is unfair.

15:53.618 --> 15:55.886
But you're not alone.

15:55.887 --> 15:59.056
Your dad, now...

15:59.057 --> 16:03.060
he can be stubborn, but he needs you.

16:03.061 --> 16:04.895
And Nat...

16:04.896 --> 16:07.765
well, he has my heart.

16:07.766 --> 16:10.134
So let him grieve with you.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.202
And remember...

16:12.203 --> 16:13.971
I love you.

16:13.972 --> 16:17.174
And I want to see you happy.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.413
I just feel like such a bad son.

16:22.414 --> 16:23.914
- You know?
- Oh, no. No, no. no.

16:23.915 --> 16:25.315
Baby.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.485
I am so proud of you.

16:28.486 --> 16:31.121
You're a great dad,

16:31.122 --> 16:34.158
and you've always been a great son.

16:35.727 --> 16:39.329
Now, delete that silly voice mail,

16:39.331 --> 16:43.567
because you're only
dwelling in your own guilt.

16:45.537 --> 16:48.238
I love you, Rel.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.544
I love you, too.

17:01.386 --> 17:03.954
So anyway, my week was fine, you know?

17:03.955 --> 17:05.969
It was good, I worked
on some of the triggers

17:05.970 --> 17:07.724
that you told me, and...

17:07.726 --> 17:09.193
everything...

17:09.194 --> 17:11.862
Look, just tell me what Rel said.

17:11.863 --> 17:14.998
Let's focus on why
you want to know what Rel said.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.901
Uh-uh. Nah. We ain't doing that.

17:17.902 --> 17:20.537
Don't use none of your
little therapy tricks on me.

17:20.538 --> 17:21.972
And how does it make you feel

17:21.973 --> 17:24.074
to think I'm using
therapy tricks on you?

17:24.075 --> 17:26.844
W-Well...

17:26.845 --> 17:28.444
makes me feel like you...

17:28.445 --> 17:29.813
Hell no.

17:29.814 --> 17:32.483
Mm-mm. I know what
you're trying to do.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.284
But it ain't gonna work this time.

17:34.285 --> 17:35.953
I'm here to talk about Rel.

17:35.954 --> 17:37.387
Brittany, HIPAA laws prevent me

17:37.389 --> 17:39.556
- from discussing...
- HIPAA laws, really?

17:39.557 --> 17:42.860
You gonna let the white man
tell you how to act?

17:42.861 --> 17:44.194
Huh?

17:44.195 --> 17:46.597
This is black therapy.

17:46.598 --> 17:49.733
Okay, now we're delving back
into your narcissistic

17:49.734 --> 17:52.302
Afrocentrism issues.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.471
Damn.

17:54.472 --> 17:55.939
You're right.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.741
I'm sorry.

17:57.742 --> 18:00.077
All right, okay.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.746
So, what did Rel say?

18:11.956 --> 18:14.424
- Dad?
- Rel?

18:14.426 --> 18:16.760
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

18:17.722 --> 18:19.667
Hey, you know, me and Mom
used to come here all the time.

18:19.691 --> 18:21.373
It was like our favorite place,
you know?

18:21.374 --> 18:23.090
Yeah, well, me and your mom
used to come and eat, too.

18:23.091 --> 18:25.393
You're not the only one that
ate with her. I was hungry.

18:25.394 --> 18:28.062
I just... you know, I'm just...
I'm celebrating right now.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.398
For real, Dad? You celebrating?

18:30.399 --> 18:32.199
You don't know how I celebrate.

18:33.368 --> 18:34.635
All right, damn, Rel. I'm...

18:34.636 --> 18:36.037
I miss her, too, man.

18:36.038 --> 18:37.405
I've just been walking around

18:37.406 --> 18:39.150
thinking about...
why-why did God take her?

18:39.174 --> 18:41.842
Of all the people he could take,
why'd he take her?

18:41.844 --> 18:45.146
Why didn't he take
that dude over there?

18:45.147 --> 18:46.781
Really?

18:48.217 --> 18:50.284
Nat showed me the pictures
of your mom and I

18:50.285 --> 18:52.130
wearing our matching
jean jackets, and I was...

18:52.154 --> 18:54.188
I was trying to prove
I was strong, so...

18:54.189 --> 18:56.090
I was gonna put my jacket on, and...

18:56.091 --> 18:57.658
I grabbed her jacket by accident,

18:57.659 --> 19:00.094
and the scent from her jacket just...

19:00.095 --> 19:02.096
- overwhelmed me. I-I just...
- Okay, Dad.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.564
Come on, it's all good, you know?

19:03.565 --> 19:05.800
It's-it's good to let it out.

19:05.801 --> 19:08.803
Look, I was holding stuff in, too.

19:08.804 --> 19:10.571
So, uh, so I get it.

19:10.572 --> 19:14.408
Look, I thought I would go before her.

19:14.409 --> 19:17.478
I never thought I'd be
bound here by myself.

19:17.479 --> 19:21.115
Look, you're not by yourself, okay?

19:21.116 --> 19:22.827
Maybe Nat is right...
may-maybe we do need

19:22.851 --> 19:24.218
to be emotional together.

19:25.954 --> 19:27.655
Right.

19:30.025 --> 19:31.425
Is that the jacket right there?

19:31.426 --> 19:33.995
Yeah, I've just been
walking around with it.

19:33.996 --> 19:35.096
Can I hold it?

19:48.677 --> 19:50.745
Come on, don't sniff

19:50.746 --> 19:53.447
all the smell out of it...
and get it off your body, man.

19:53.448 --> 19:55.883
I don't know what kind of funk
you got on yourself.

19:59.621 --> 20:01.622
Man.

20:03.191 --> 20:04.692
Dad, are you...

20:04.693 --> 20:07.328
- are you crying?
- I'm fine, man, I'm fine!

20:07.329 --> 20:08.496
No, it's-it's literally...

20:08.497 --> 20:09.974
It's o... it's okay to cry
in front of me.

20:09.998 --> 20:12.466
Damn you, Rel, you gonna make
me cry in a public place!

20:13.769 --> 20:16.470
Now I can't come back here no more!

20:16.471 --> 20:18.439
Nobody paying attention to us.
Nobody saw it.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.075
He did.

20:21.076 --> 20:22.676
Now we're gonna have to kill him.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.127
So, how was your day, Rel?

20:30.128 --> 20:33.360
I got in trouble
for doing my British accent.

20:33.361 --> 20:36.230
Where'd you learn
a British accent?

20:36.231 --> 20:37.931
<i>Mr. Belvedere.</i>

20:37.933 --> 20:40.901
The old-ass white butler?

20:40.902 --> 20:43.803
How dare
you, madam! A little class?

20:43.804 --> 20:46.573
Oh. Okay, Mr. Belvedere.

20:46.574 --> 20:47.941
What happened?

20:47.942 --> 20:50.043
I was simply trading my baseball cards

20:50.044 --> 20:52.111
when this vile little beast came up

20:52.113 --> 20:53.947
and stole my Andre Dawson card.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.782
And you know what I called him?

20:55.783 --> 20:57.884
Rubbish.

20:57.885 --> 20:59.919
So, you were doing something

20:59.920 --> 21:01.988
you shouldn't have been doing in class

21:01.989 --> 21:03.523
and got in trouble?

21:03.524 --> 21:05.191
Bob's your uncle.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.094
That means yes.

21:08.095 --> 21:09.996
Well, Mr. Belvedere,

21:09.997 --> 21:12.465
I should ground you, but...

21:12.466 --> 21:14.801
I'm impressed with your accent.

21:14.802 --> 21:17.904
Please, simply don't
let it happen again.

21:17.905 --> 21:19.216
Thank you, Mum.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.874
Pip-pip, cheerio.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.442
Now, what should we order?

21:22.443 --> 21:24.377
Mmm. Fish and chips.

21:24.378 --> 21:26.145
Bangers and mash.

21:27.381 --> 21:28.615
Never mind.

21:28.616 --> 21:31.217
Good. 'Cause that sounds nasty.
