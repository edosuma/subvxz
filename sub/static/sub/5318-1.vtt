Kiera Cameron, and / came
here from the year 2077.

Evolution is on

The war begins now.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.676
Emily, it's okay.

00:12.763 --> 00:13.752
I love you, too.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.007
Emily!
(SCREAMING)

00:19.937 --> 00:21.438
I have to accept the truth

00:21.981 --> 00:24.893
that / may never get back
to him. That doesn’t mean
/ have to stop trying.

00:25.610 --> 00:26.941
That’s all I’ve ever wanted.

00:27.028 --> 00:30.771
To put the pieces
back together
and return to my family.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.355
I'm sorry, Kiera.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.611
Alec, I can go home!

00:35.119 --> 00:36.700
I know. (PANTING)

00:37.121 --> 00:38.110
But I have to save her.

00:38.623 --> 00:39.612
No, Alec!

00:40.166 --> 00:41.531
Emily, I traveled
through time for you.

00:43.127 --> 00:46.290
You. I choose you.

00:46.881 --> 00:49.042
So, I guess we're not
gonna be pals then, huh?

00:49.133 --> 00:50.213
I don't see how.

00:50.927 --> 00:52.383
KIERA: There are
two Alec Sadlers.

00:52.470 --> 00:55.553
He made the time device work.
He traveled back
to change things

00:55.640 --> 00:58.723
and created another
timeline. This one.

00:59.477 --> 01:02.435
That’s what created
the ultimate future
that this guy comes from.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.312
Travelers lead, let's knock
all the dominos down.

01:05.483 --> 01:08.190
When things get too hairy,
I want you to use this.

01:08.527 --> 01:11.269
All right, let's let
the big man himself
send you off.

01:12.823 --> 01:13.812
BRAD: Sir.

01:13.991 --> 01:17.279
You want to cheat
death, Kellog? Help me,
and I'll teach you how.

01:17.745 --> 01:21.488
I'm just a cog in the machine
now, Carlos. I don't get to
play chess master anymore.

01:21.832 --> 01:22.867
Somehow, I doubt that.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.574
KELLOG: That was yesterday.

01:25.962 --> 01:27.077
She is a heartbreaker.

for the attempted
murder ofAlec Sadler.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.582
This timeline isn't big
enough for the both of us.

KELLOG:
/ have been getting the other
Alec to sign documents

01:42.103 --> 01:45.937
that remove him and put
me in the big chair.

01:47.316 --> 01:48.476
This will send a signal.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.980
If nobody hears it,
nothing happens.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.358
And if someone
does hear it?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.239
Then we've failed.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.801
Mr. Sadler's

Thank you so much, Carlos.
We really appreciate it.

02:47.710 --> 02:51.498
Good. You can reciprocate
by getting Piron to support
my department's requests

02:52.089 --> 02:54.421
now that it's finally
in the hands of a sane person.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.171
All right, what happened?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.502
Kellog happened.

03:01.474 --> 03:04.011
He tricked other me
into turning over control
of the company to him.

Uh, excuse me?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.413
If they're important,
the decisions.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.749
See, that's where I come in.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.921
I can let you know in advance
which decisions are key
to protecting your future

16:52.012 --> 16:53.548
and which decisions are not.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.054
Think of the traveler
as a road map.
Hmm.

16:56.391 --> 17:01.852
A map to this grim future
where I'm some warlord
leading an army.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.809
Not the future. Right now.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.852
Your foot soldiers
are here in this time.

17:11.114 --> 17:14.447
I can help you use them,
push their actions.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.905
Push the timeline in
the right direction.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.031
The right way.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.163
I'm still gonna
think about it.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.458
That's your prerogative,
of course.
But one way or another,

17:25.795 --> 17:27.831
your destiny will
catch up with you.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.042
And bring you back to me.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.248
To us.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.427
Then I have something
to look forward to.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.128
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

17:38.350 --> 17:41.137
Now, ifyou'll excuse me,
I've got some business
to attend to.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.385
Of course.

17:56.493 --> 18:00.452
Interesting night.
Uh, yeah. You could say that.

18:00.956 --> 18:03.789
Between the power outage
and the street warfare,

18:03.875 --> 18:05.831
I'm guessing more
Liber8 activity.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.877
I'm worried it's
a new faction.
Based on what?

18:09.339 --> 18:10.328
Solid Intel.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.414
Provided by Kiera Cameron?

18:13.927 --> 18:16.919
There's CCTV security
footage of her with
members of Liber8.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.966
Working with them.
Uh-huh.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.219
Yeah, Kiera's managed
to infiltrate Liber8.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.891
She's gathering Intel
that should lead to
some high-profile arrests.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.557
That's quite the promise.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.013
More of a hopeful prediction.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.140
I want results.
Not predictions.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.192
Copy that. Oh, did you
hear about Dillon?

18:34.406 --> 18:37.193
What?
Doctors cleared him.
He'll be out any day.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.028
I can go back to
being a detective.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.531
I wouldn't throw away
that sport coat just yet.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.371
Word on the street is
he's done with the force.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.540
(SIGHS) Jesus Christ.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.872
I never took you
for a religious man.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.340
Do you realize the position
that you put me in?

18:57.554 --> 19:01.467
I promise, this is the
last time you'll ever
have to cover for me.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.848
What are you talking about?

19:05.895 --> 19:06.884
Nothing.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.272
ljust want to protect
you and the department
in any way that I can.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.732
I've caused enough damage.
Literally and figuratively.

19:16.614 --> 19:17.603
Are you okay?

19:18.783 --> 19:19.772
Yes.

19:20.744 --> 19:21.733
Okay.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.535
So why don't you tell me
what happened last night?

19:25.123 --> 19:29.082
Brad wanted to see
ifwe had prevented
Kellog's dark future.

19:29.961 --> 19:30.950
Unfortunately,

19:31.838 --> 19:35.422
proof that we failed
showed up in the form of six
heavily-armored soldiers.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.671
And where are they now?
I don't know.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.378
And Brad?

19:42.807 --> 19:44.593
I haven't seen him
since last night.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.343
(SIGHS) I'm hoping that
he might be working
them from the inside.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.719
Might be?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.356
I'm worried.

19:54.903 --> 19:55.983
(SIGHS)

19:57.322 --> 20:00.405
All right, we gotta figure out
where these soldiers are
and what they're planning.

20:00.575 --> 20:01.735
Target Kellog.

20:02.577 --> 20:05.865
They're connected to him and
whatever he's cooking up
in that twisted mind of his.

20:06.164 --> 20:09.372
(SCOFFS) Kellog, as in
my new overlord?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.830
Same guy.
Well, it's not gonna be as
easy as it sounds.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.419
Kellog has consolidated
a lot of power and money,

20:15.507 --> 20:18.249
and his influence
in this department
shouldn't be underestimated.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.129
Piron still holds the
purse strings around here.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.469
I'm sure you can
find a way around that.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.971
Well, I'm still a cop, Kiera.
I've got to follow the rules.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.215
But you could get me
something concrete

20:27.310 --> 20:29.926
that I can arrest Kellog on
and we could share the load.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.645
Paﬂneh
Okay.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.648
Iwill work on
nailing his ass,

20:36.653 --> 20:38.985
but it might be fun
to shake the tree first.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.688
And what did you
have in mind?

21:05.974 --> 21:07.339
So, which one
are you?

21:08.601 --> 21:09.807
The good one.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.685
I think you'd both say that.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.688
I'm the only one.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.522
Then how good are you?

21:21.698 --> 21:23.029
How much do you know?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.364
Sadler told me
a little bit.

21:26.661 --> 21:30.324
Brought some other
things together.
Your future, mine.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.249
Who are those guys?
Political activist friends.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.124
They look serious.
Yeah, they are serious.

21:43.219 --> 21:46.006
About making change.
Outsmart your enemy.

21:46.598 --> 21:49.840
Don't make yourself
a target. Embed,
disrupt from the inside.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.225
(SCOFFS)
This is serendipitous.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.599
That's what I came
to talk to you about.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.686
I'm listening.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.062
Do you still have your
employee access card to Piron?

22:04.616 --> 22:07.073
They haven't fired
me yet... Yet.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.566
That's good.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.988
Maybe that change
that you're talking about,

22:13.082 --> 22:14.413
maybe we can make it together.

22:21.925 --> 22:22.914
Laying low?

22:26.763 --> 22:28.628
The protector might be our
friend for the moment,

22:29.015 --> 22:31.927
but she still works for
a system that wants to
bring us down, Lucas.

22:32.727 --> 22:35.469
We have to start
thinking about survival
and disappearing.

22:38.316 --> 22:41.854
You have an update?
Yeah, but, uh, you're
not gonna like it.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.028
It seems like all that effort
we put into switching

22:46.115 --> 22:48.948
Alec Sadler's at the HALO
launch event was for nothing.

22:50.203 --> 22:55.197
Kellog's pulled a fast one
and arranged to have the kid
removed from his company.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.576
He's holding all
the cards now.

22:57.877 --> 22:58.957
Kellog controlling Piron.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.453
That can't be good for us.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.040
I'll tell Travis.
There's more.

23:06.261 --> 23:09.378
There's some kind of a
temporal event connected
to Kellog's future.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.463
What's the protector
doing about it?

23:12.141 --> 23:14.678
It's unclear.
Why is that?

23:15.979 --> 23:19.471
Kiera's protecting Brad.
They're his people.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.816
Then we can't trust her.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.366
Are you sure you
thought this through?
Completely.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.084
So, finally I say to the guy,

23:45.883 --> 23:49.671
"If I can't land
a helicopter on it, what's
the point of buying it?"

23:50.138 --> 23:51.969
(ALL CHUCKLE)
(LAUGHS)

24:07.739 --> 24:09.775
Excuse me, ma'am,
this is a private party.
Invited guests only.

24:09.866 --> 24:10.855
(BUZZING)
(GROANS)

24:15.204 --> 24:16.819
Oh, it never gets old.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.117
(CLEARS THROAT)

24:22.462 --> 24:24.874
Um, excuse me.
This won't take a minute.

24:28.301 --> 24:29.507
Carlos!

24:30.011 --> 24:32.502
What a surprise,
I don't remember your
name on the guest list.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.554
Yours, however, is always
on the guest list.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.215
I'm flattered.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.342
I'm here on business, Kellog.
Oh.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.219
Why don't you tell us what
happened with Alec?

24:41.606 --> 24:43.767
Which one are
you referring to?
KIERA: Don't be a dick.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.644
What are you up to?

24:46.235 --> 24:48.851
Business. Just like Carlos.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.403
All right, look. From where
I was standing, the other
Alec was a problem.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.321
He was a shithead,
to be frank.

24:56.746 --> 24:57.986
You knew it, I knew it.

24:58.331 --> 25:02.244
I just took care
of the situation in
my own creative way.

25:02.585 --> 25:06.498
Fine. Then give the
Piron keys back to the
Alec who isn't a problem.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.673
Pdloveto,
but the board doesn't
know what we know

25:10.760 --> 25:14.753
and it might be a hard
sell to them with the whole
time travel doubles thing,

25:14.847 --> 25:16.383
you know.
Paradoxically speaking.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.391
Why don't you tell us
about these soldiers
from Brad's future?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.434
I'm sorry, your future.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.851
Sorry, come again?
In English, please?

25:27.610 --> 25:31.819
Power suits, heavy
weapons, warlord Kellog
future scenario?

25:33.950 --> 25:36.032
Brad spelled it out for us.

25:36.119 --> 25:39.611
Well, maybe he's the one
you should be talking to.
Your boyfriend.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.364
Perhaps you should start
your investigation there.

25:43.668 --> 25:44.828
(LAUGHS)

25:45.336 --> 25:46.621
Let's go, Kiera.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.968
Oh, yeah! (LAUGHS)

26:00.059 --> 26:01.469
In your face, Kellog.

26:02.854 --> 26:04.094
Excuse me, please.

26:04.856 --> 26:06.392
Yeah, yeah. Right. Okay.

26:06.691 --> 26:07.897
Shut it down.

26:10.194 --> 26:13.152
It's an outside DNS attack,
our entire network shut down.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.899
Well, get it back up.

26:17.577 --> 26:21.195
Everything alright, Matthew?
You know it's not,
you're obviously behind it.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.497
We have nothing
to do with whatever's
going on right now.

26:25.585 --> 26:26.995
ls somebody mad
at you, Kellog?

26:27.170 --> 26:31.334
Whoeverjust hacked
into this company
is breaking the law, Carlos.

26:32.175 --> 26:34.006
Why don't you do yourjob?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.466
You know what?
You're right. I'm sorry.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.135
I'll get to the
bottom of this.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.220
In fact, I know
the perfect guy

26:40.308 --> 26:43.095
that can help us
track down the perpetrators
of this heinous act.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.848
And he's a whiz
with computers.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.360
Whatjust happened?
I have no idea.

26:59.452 --> 27:00.988
Kellog is up to something

27:01.078 --> 27:03.945
and I have a feeling
those soldiers are just
the tip of the iceberg.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.117
Yeah, no doubt about that.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.575
Look, if Brad is
embedded with these guys,

27:08.711 --> 27:10.417
and I'm notjudging,

27:11.380 --> 27:15.714
I'm just saying, ifyou have
questions, maybe you should
press him for answers.

27:23.935 --> 27:25.971
(PHONE RINGING)
It's gotta be Kellog.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.102
Put him on speaker.

27:34.529 --> 27:35.518
Alec Sadler.

27:35.613 --> 27:38.355
ls Julian there?
He is, and you're
on speakerphone.

27:39.242 --> 27:40.357
You're fired, Julian.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.741
You can't fire me,
I already quit.

27:42.912 --> 27:43.901
KELLOG: However you like.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.072
Alec, I know you're
behind this hack.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.953
Fix it. Right now.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.668
Or I take this to Defcon 1.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.208
You already did that when
you stole my company.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.414
Okay.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.089
Are you ready to
play big league
hardball with me, kid?

28:07.270 --> 28:08.510
Bring it.

28:14.569 --> 28:16.480
And CMR is connected.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.614
(CHUCKLES)
Just like old times.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.160
You miss the barn?
Every day.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.370
Alec, before
we get to work,

28:32.753 --> 28:34.914
I need to know what
you did to Kellog.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.046
Nothing too harsh.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.374
Alec, what did you do?

28:41.095 --> 28:42.460
I sort of locked him
out of his own system

28:42.555 --> 28:45.388
and then downloaded
and erased all the data
and control software

28:45.474 --> 28:46.725
for Piron's equipment.

28:47.476 --> 28:48.977
You're asking for trouble.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.144
Actually, I'm trying
to send you home.

28:52.690 --> 28:53.679
What do you mean?

28:53.983 --> 28:57.726
All of Piron's anti-matter
time travel research is
in the data that I stole.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.778
I thought we could use the
time to figure out a way

29:00.865 --> 29:04.574
to exploit the company's tech
and eventually send you home.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.112
Thank you.
That's inspired.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.744
Kellog's going to be
so focused getting his
business back up and running

29:11.834 --> 29:13.540
he won't even have
time to realize what
we're really up to.

29:13.628 --> 29:14.743
Good.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.961
While you're working on that,

29:19.008 --> 29:21.715
I'd also like you
to help me find
Brad and the soldiers.

29:22.345 --> 29:23.425
I thought you were
staying out of it.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.218
It's just for my
own peace of mind.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.298
If he's in tight with
them, I'll back off.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.016
But if he's in trouble...
I understand.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.355
Can you do it?
Maybe.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.102
Their gear is
probably operating on
some advanced tech,

29:37.193 --> 29:38.353
odd wavelength stuff.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.521
I could do a sweep
of the spectrum,

29:40.613 --> 29:42.695
see if there's any areas
with unique energy signatures.

29:42.949 --> 29:46.237
It won't give you an exact
address, but I can narrow it
down to a few city blocks.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.947
You could go down there
using your super suit
as a kind of antenna.

29:49.038 --> 29:50.323
I could give you
a specific building.

29:50.623 --> 29:51.954
All right, good enough.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.703
Let's get started.

30:20.069 --> 30:23.232
You're breaking down the
power suits, cannibalizing
the core components.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.233
Something like that.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.278
What exactly are you building?

30:31.163 --> 30:33.370
This mission is
a need-to-know basis, and
you don't need to know.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.498
Nolan?

30:36.585 --> 30:39.918
Give it time. Marcellus has
a lot on his plate and you...

30:40.006 --> 30:40.995
What about me?

30:41.340 --> 30:42.796
You can't see what we can.

30:48.639 --> 30:49.799
All right, take a left.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.593
Try the end of the block.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.051
How long is this gonna take?

30:55.146 --> 30:56.682
Depends on how fast you go.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.768
I take it back.
I don't miss this.

31:00.276 --> 31:01.766
Your CMR says you're lying.

31:03.612 --> 31:04.601
Great.

31:08.617 --> 31:09.606
Shit.

31:10.119 --> 31:11.359
Are you following me?

31:11.454 --> 31:13.945
No. It's a total coincidence.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.122
What are you doing, Kiera?

31:17.918 --> 31:18.907
Boyfriend issues?

31:20.463 --> 31:21.748
Something like that.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.501
Kellog's soldiers are
a problem for all of us.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.382
You don't get
to call the shots.

31:27.470 --> 31:28.960
Give me a head start.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.971
I'll clear Brad from the area
and you can roll in,
back me up

31:32.433 --> 31:33.468
and do yourthing.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.890
Whoa, the signal just spiked.
You're getting close.

31:36.353 --> 31:37.479
Alec says we're close.

31:37.938 --> 31:40.554
Are you gonna help me
out or am I gonna shut this
whole thing down right now?

31:40.941 --> 31:42.681
ALEC: Got it.
It’s the building
to your left, Kiera.

31:44.195 --> 31:45.184
This is it.

31:46.447 --> 31:48.233
Hey, head start, remember?

31:49.825 --> 31:51.281
I changed my mind.

31:51.368 --> 31:55.236
Listen to me, I have
seen these men in action.

31:55.331 --> 31:56.821
You need to have
the upper hand,

31:57.333 --> 31:58.664
and right now you don't.

32:00.795 --> 32:01.830
I can play nice.

32:03.214 --> 32:04.579
You got 10 minutes.

32:04.840 --> 32:05.955
Perfect.

32:07.885 --> 32:09.921
Are you seriously gonna
let Garza try anything?

32:10.012 --> 32:12.344
No. Get Carlos on speed dial.

32:12.473 --> 32:14.213
I want him ready to roll.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.052
No matter what.

32:16.811 --> 32:17.846
Gotcha.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.205
Why take the chance?

32:47.550 --> 32:49.711
It's not that simple.
We served together.

32:50.761 --> 32:52.843
You don't win wars with
sentimentality, Marcellus.

32:52.930 --> 32:53.919
No, you don't.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.680
You win them with recon
and support.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.596
Tonkin arranged this place,
our supplies, and our comm.

32:59.687 --> 33:00.676
He's delivered.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.068
It's my call.
We'll see how it plays out.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.405
ALEC: Thatis
definitely not from now.

33:18.414 --> 33:20.245
/’m recording a// this, Kiera.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.286
You ever see anything
like that in your time?

33:23.586 --> 33:25.076
No, that's a new one.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.919
It's like Time Travel
Team Six.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.176
We have 11 days max
before the core degrades.

33:31.302 --> 33:33.714
If we're gonna have
a fight we're gonna need
more medical supplies.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.006
MARCELLUS: Crew is on edge.
It’s their problem, not yours.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.019
BRAD: Marcellus, / don’t know
half of these guys.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.098
You know we can’t
do this without you.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.271
Looks like he's convinced
them he's one of them.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.932
It'll be nice having
someone on the inside
feeding us info.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.016
JASON: Mmm-hmm.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.520
Whoa, whoa, what is that?
It's cool.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.980
Can you grab me that?
It looks like a pen.

34:02.791 --> 34:03.780
Watch her, Kiera.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.550
What's she doing?

34:15.304 --> 34:17.215
Get her out of there.
Get her out of there.
Kiera, Brad is safe.

34:17.306 --> 34:18.421
You need to leave.

34:23.437 --> 34:24.768
(GROANS)

35:05.562 --> 35:06.551
Got her!

35:07.648 --> 35:08.763
(GUN FIRING)

35:08.899 --> 35:10.059
(GRUNTS)

35:12.027 --> 35:13.767
Nice shot.
Blow me.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.530
Watch our backs, there
could be more of them.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.694
Alec, get me out of here. Now!

35:27.209 --> 35:29.666
Alec, I'm burned.
I need a way out, now!

35:29.795 --> 35:31.535
Okay, hang on, just
give me a second!

35:36.719 --> 35:37.879
(GUN FIRING)

35:46.645 --> 35:47.851
Now you're out.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.155
(GASPS)

35:58.073 --> 35:59.233
(GROANS)

36:07.374 --> 36:08.659
I know who you are.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.537
That makes two of us.
What are you doing here?

36:12.129 --> 36:13.539
I could ask you
the same thing.

36:13.630 --> 36:16.667
You're not in a position to
be asking any questions.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.840
I'm a police officer,

36:18.927 --> 36:22.419
and that man is
a suspect in an investigation
that I'm conducting.

36:22.890 --> 36:24.755
Now, I don't know what you
think you're doing here,

36:24.850 --> 36:28.342
but I do know that you're
involved with Matthew Kellog,
and so do the police.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.936
I'm calling Carlos.
Don't!

36:33.275 --> 36:34.481
What do you mean, don't?

36:35.694 --> 36:36.934
Don't trust him.

36:37.446 --> 36:39.607
You might consider
Kellog an ally,

36:39.698 --> 36:41.814
but he's only interested
in one thing. Kellog.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.323
This is a waste
of our time.

36:44.745 --> 36:45.734
Toss her.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.407
Marcellus, she
could be useful.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.489
Useful?

36:52.461 --> 36:53.541
What'd he tell you?

36:55.547 --> 36:56.536
Nothing.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.752
He tried to kill me,
and he failed.

37:00.969 --> 37:01.958
(PANTING)

37:03.722 --> 37:04.711
Apparently not.

37:04.807 --> 37:05.796
(GRUNTS)

37:10.312 --> 37:11.301
(THUDS)

37:13.148 --> 37:14.137
(GROANS)

37:16.527 --> 37:17.516
(GUN FIRING)

37:19.279 --> 37:20.655
(GUN FIRING)

37:23.325 --> 37:24.986
(TIRES SCREECHING)

37:25.911 --> 37:27.321
Let's go after them!
Stand down!

37:27.955 --> 37:29.820
We pack up and we move.
Agreed.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.573
This place will be crawling
with cops in no time.

37:45.848 --> 37:46.928
That was close.

37:47.141 --> 37:49.177
(EXHALES) Too close!

37:52.479 --> 37:53.514
Have you seen Emily?

37:54.857 --> 37:56.017
Not for a while.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.358
(TIRES SCREECHING)

38:18.964 --> 38:20.625
(GRUNTING)

38:30.893 --> 38:33.805
(GRUNTING)

39:00.631 --> 39:01.962
Get out! Now!

39:05.260 --> 39:06.636
(GROANS)

39:20.359 --> 39:22.691
All right, keep me
posted. Yeah.

39:25.239 --> 39:26.274
All right.

39:27.366 --> 39:30.574
So SWAT cleared
the building, there's no
sign of our new friends.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.952
Surprise, surprise.
(SIGHS)

39:35.624 --> 39:36.704
What is it?

39:36.792 --> 39:39.033
I just feel like we've
been down this road before.

39:39.503 --> 39:42.085
It's Liber8 all
over again. (SIGHS)

39:43.632 --> 39:46.214
Well, this time we know
they're working for Kellog

39:46.301 --> 39:48.132
and we've got a man
on the inside.

39:48.470 --> 39:51.428
Well, if that's the case,
why don't we have
anybody in custody yet?

39:53.517 --> 39:55.428
Maybe Brad will reach out.
(SCOFFS)

39:56.353 --> 39:58.264
We can't count on "maybe."

40:03.318 --> 40:06.025
You know, ever since you got
knocked out there's been...

40:06.738 --> 40:08.274
I don't know,
something different.

40:09.992 --> 40:13.359
Sorry. I've been preoccupied.

40:14.121 --> 40:15.827
Thoughts of 2077.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.573
Home. Sam.

40:21.253 --> 40:22.584
Of course.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.622
I need to believe that
path still exists for me.

40:28.844 --> 40:31.335
That I'll be able
to see him again.

40:36.810 --> 40:39.176
Well, I support
you going home.

40:39.271 --> 40:42.354
I'm not happy about it,
but I support you.

40:46.153 --> 40:47.984
To going home.
(LAUGHS)

40:59.499 --> 41:00.625
To going home.

41:14.765 --> 41:17.006
JASMINE: You're late.
I had to be careful.

41:18.018 --> 41:19.929
You said this was about
Kellog and his new friends.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.681
That's the only
reason I'm here.
So make it quick.

41:21.855 --> 41:24.813
I don't think any of us
can afford to let Kellog
become more powerful.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.231
More insulated,

41:26.318 --> 41:28.934
build and control an army
that shapes history his way.

41:29.738 --> 41:30.853
What are you saying?

41:30.947 --> 41:34.906
I'm saying what's good for you
and Liber8 is most likely
what's bad for Kellog.

41:35.535 --> 41:36.615
(SNICKERS)

41:37.287 --> 41:39.073
You want us to
take out Kellog?

41:39.414 --> 41:41.245
To do your dirty work?
No.

41:41.750 --> 41:44.241
No, I think you've
got plenty of good
reasons to kill Kellog.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.952
ljust don't think
you can afford to
waste any more time.

41:49.091 --> 41:50.251
Goodnight, Jasmine.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.228
This package was
delivered for you.

42:14.157 --> 42:15.442
I've cleared it for security.

42:16.326 --> 42:17.361
Thank you, Jacqueline.

43:09.296 --> 43:10.456
Hiya, pal.
