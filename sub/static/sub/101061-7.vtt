WEBVTT

00:07.750 --> 00:09.333
<i>What is reality?</i>

00:11.916 --> 00:14.083
<i>And is there only one of them?</i>

00:15.666 --> 00:19.416
<i>Or do several realities coexist?</i>

00:21.166 --> 00:23.916
<i>To help explain, Erwin Schroedinger</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:27.125
<i>devised an extremely interesting</i>
<i>thought experiment.</i>

00:28.000 --> 00:29.625
<i>Schroedinger's cat.</i>

00:30.916 --> 00:34.083
<i>A cat is locked in a steel chamber</i>

00:34.166 --> 00:37.875
<i>with a tiny amount</i>
<i>of radioactive substance,</i>

00:38.000 --> 00:41.791
<i>a Geiger counter,</i>
<i>a vial of poison, and a hammer.</i>

00:43.250 --> 00:47.166
<i>As soon as a radioactive atom decays</i>
<i>inside the steel chamber,</i>

00:47.250 --> 00:51.583
<i>the Geiger counter releases the hammer,</i>
<i>which smashes the vial of poison.</i>

00:51.666 --> 00:53.000
<i>The cat is dead.</i>

00:53.541 --> 00:54.583
<i>However,</i>

00:55.166 --> 01:00.125
due to the wave characteristics
in the quantum world,

01:01.750 --> 01:05.458
the atom has both decayed and not decayed,

01:06.333 --> 01:11.833
until our own observation
forces it into a definitive state.

01:12.583 --> 01:15.291
until the instant we look and see,
we don't know

01:15.375 --> 01:18.250
if the cat is dead or alive.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.750
It exists in two superposed states.

01:25.458 --> 01:27.291
The properties "dead"

01:28.666 --> 01:30.083
and "alive"

01:30.458 --> 01:33.833
therefore exist simultaneously
in the microcosm.

01:38.083 --> 01:43.083
<i>But what if the simultaneous existence</i>
<i>of life and death</i>

01:43.625 --> 01:46.458
<i>also applied to the macrocosmic world?</i>

01:49.875 --> 01:51.166
I'll make this right.

01:54.291 --> 01:58.875
<i>Could two different realities</i>
<i>potentially exist side by side?</i>

02:03.083 --> 02:05.375
<i>Could we manage to split time</i>

02:05.458 --> 02:10.125
<i>and allow it run</i>
<i>in two opposing directions?</i>

02:11.166 --> 02:12.625
And by doing so, allow the cat

02:13.416 --> 02:17.916
to simultaneously exist in both states,
dead and alive?

02:19.958 --> 02:21.333
<i>And, if so,</i>

02:22.041 --> 02:24.666
<i>how many different realities...</i>

02:26.250 --> 02:28.291
<i>could exist side by side?</i>

02:28.375 --> 02:29.458
Martha!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.041
Wait!

02:35.125 --> 02:36.458
You can't go in there.

02:37.958 --> 02:38.958
Bartosz?

02:49.833 --> 02:53.291
-What are you doing here?
-Adam and the others lied to you.

02:53.375 --> 02:55.791
He doesn't want to help you.
He's going to kill you.

02:56.166 --> 02:58.875
In the future.
He doesn't want to stop the apocalypse.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.750
Everyone will die.

03:00.833 --> 03:03.625
Not because of you, but because of him.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.166
I know what the origin is.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.208
And how it's all connected.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.500
Please.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.541
I can show you.

03:26.625 --> 03:28.125
You've got to trust me.

05:14.875 --> 05:19.500
IN BETWEEN TIME

05:47.166 --> 05:51.208
<i>It's hard for people to accept death.</i>

05:51.708 --> 05:54.083
TANNHAUS FAMILY: NOVEMBER 8, 1971
MAREK, SONJA, CHARLOTTE

05:54.166 --> 05:56.541
<i>We hold on tightly to things</i>
<i>that are long gone.</i>

06:08.083 --> 06:09.916
CHARLOTTE
MAY 30, 1971

06:10.000 --> 06:14.500
<i>We long in vain</i>
<i>for a way to turn back time.</i>

06:17.958 --> 06:20.666
<i>A way to reverse death.</i>

06:34.500 --> 06:37.458
<i>But if time is relative</i>

06:37.541 --> 06:40.416
<i>and nothing is really ever in the past,</i>

06:41.166 --> 06:46.583
<i>and the simultaneous overlapping</i>
<i>of different realities is possible,</i>

06:47.583 --> 06:50.250
<i>shouldn't it then be possible</i>

06:50.333 --> 06:54.666
<i>to bring back something</i>
<i>that was believed to be dead long ago</i>

06:55.625 --> 07:00.833
<i>and to create a new reality</i>
<i>in which what is dead lives again?</i>

07:03.375 --> 07:06.416
<i>If our life is defined as that</i>

07:06.500 --> 07:09.125
<i>which lies between birth and death,</i>

07:10.000 --> 07:13.250
<i>then it exists there in infinite versions.</i>

07:15.166 --> 07:18.333
<i>Could we succeed in cheating death</i>

07:19.000 --> 07:21.166
<i>by finding a way</i>

07:22.041 --> 07:23.875
<i>to bring back life?</i>

07:24.916 --> 07:27.791
<i>There, between time.</i>

08:16.041 --> 08:21.083
FOR CHARLOTTE

08:24.958 --> 08:26.875
Tell me about paradise.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.083
Paradise...

08:34.500 --> 08:35.833
is free

08:36.833 --> 08:38.500
of pain and suffering.

08:40.916 --> 08:43.583
Everything we've ever done...

08:44.791 --> 08:46.541
is forgotten there.

08:48.958 --> 08:50.375
Any pain...

08:52.500 --> 08:54.291
we've ever felt...

08:56.125 --> 08:57.416
is erased.

08:58.750 --> 08:59.833
And...

09:00.875 --> 09:02.416
all the dead...

09:05.000 --> 09:05.916
live.

09:07.083 --> 09:09.291
Adam will keep his promise.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.708
The passage will open.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.208
What do you want?

11:02.708 --> 11:05.875
You've been promising us
there's a way out of here for ages.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.333
That we can stop the apocalypse.

11:16.958 --> 11:19.458
But you still don't know
how the portal works.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.041
It will work.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.958
I saw it work.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.875
In the future.

11:28.666 --> 11:30.458
And then what?

11:31.916 --> 11:34.291
When are you finally going
to tell us the truth?

11:34.375 --> 11:36.083
You don't want to go back.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.250
You don't want
to stop the apocalypse at all.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.000
This is bigger than us.

11:50.166 --> 11:51.958
Bigger than the apocalypse.

11:53.791 --> 11:57.208
If the portal works,
we can use it to find the origin.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.125
The one moment that started all this.

12:01.791 --> 12:04.083
And when we've found it, we'll destroy it.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.791
And everything that arises from it.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.333
That is paradise.

12:13.791 --> 12:15.208
Paradise?

12:17.125 --> 12:19.375
We've been stuck here for two years.

12:20.958 --> 12:22.500
Two fucking years!

12:23.958 --> 12:25.875
I don't want your fucking paradise.

12:27.208 --> 12:28.583
I just want out of here.

13:27.583 --> 13:28.625
Hello?

13:48.750 --> 13:51.666
I... didn't mean to startle you.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.750
Sometimes I think
it'll never stop raining.

14:01.333 --> 14:02.625
I'm...

14:03.166 --> 14:04.416
Silja.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.333
Bartosz.

15:45.625 --> 15:48.291
We can start
a new series of experiments tomorrow.

15:52.458 --> 15:54.541
I know we've been trying for a long time,

15:55.291 --> 15:56.583
but it will work.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.875
Jonas.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.083
You can't lose hope.

16:08.541 --> 16:09.958
I can't do this anymore.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.875
What are you doing here?

19:12.208 --> 19:13.708
Are you following me?

19:14.625 --> 19:15.833
You promised me something.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.250
Adam promised me something.

19:20.583 --> 19:23.125
You said the apocalypse must happen.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.125
So that we can be saved.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.500
So that all of us will be saved.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.083
You can't die.

20:15.208 --> 20:17.041
You can't take your own life.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.333
Because your older self already exists.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.125
Time won't allow it.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.000
No matter what you try...

20:31.041 --> 20:32.375
something...

20:33.458 --> 20:34.916
or someone...

20:35.916 --> 20:38.416
will always stop you from doing it.

20:41.166 --> 20:42.708
Elisabeth and I,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.750
we found the passage.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.541
You must keep your promise.

21:27.416 --> 21:28.875
It will open again.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.500
And then you will...

21:34.500 --> 21:36.166
Then Adam will...

21:38.125 --> 21:39.708
lead us to paradise.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.833
He said we will become friends.

21:57.833 --> 21:59.708
Before you betray me.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.916
Yes! Good.

22:24.583 --> 22:25.833
Once more.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.000
Once more.

22:29.083 --> 22:30.541
Yes! Yes!

22:34.250 --> 22:35.750
It's a boy.

22:53.291 --> 22:54.625
What will you name him?

23:05.791 --> 23:06.625
Hanno.

23:10.541 --> 23:13.875
<i>Fate is playing a cruel game with us.</i>

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
<i>Yet we will always believe there is</i>
<i>a way to turn the tide in our favor.</i>

23:32.083 --> 23:34.500
<i>If only we want it badly enough.</i>

23:42.125 --> 23:47.041
<i>A person is able to pursue a goal,</i>
<i>no matter how unattainable it may seem,</i>

23:47.708 --> 23:51.458
<i>over the course of an entire lifetime.</i>

23:53.541 --> 23:57.208
<i>No resistance, no obstacle is great enough</i>

23:57.291 --> 24:00.458
<i>to stop one from pursuing one's will.</i>

24:02.916 --> 24:05.708
<i>Is this stubbornness in our striving</i>

24:05.791 --> 24:09.583
<i>not that which distinguishes us</i>
<i>from animals,</i>

24:09.666 --> 24:12.875
<i>which know only short-lived desire?</i>

24:16.291 --> 24:19.666
<i>And isn't all progress, through all ages,</i>

24:19.750 --> 24:24.375
<i>not the product</i>
<i>of this unquenchable act of will?</i>

24:28.875 --> 24:31.875
<i>No matter what motivates our will,</i>

24:31.958 --> 24:36.000
<i>it will guide us on our path.</i>

24:42.000 --> 24:44.916
<i>We will only be able to let go</i>

24:45.000 --> 24:48.666
<i>when we have finally attained our goal</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

26:15.208 --> 26:17.333
Why do you think it's not working?

26:20.833 --> 26:23.375
Maybe Claudia doesn't want it to work.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.250
Why do you even trust her?

26:29.375 --> 26:31.125
Why did you trust him?

26:31.208 --> 26:32.250
Adam?

26:34.333 --> 26:35.833
He lied to you.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.458
There is no paradise.

26:39.125 --> 26:41.125
There's no world other than this one.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.375
I know you think I will become him.

26:45.458 --> 26:46.625
But I won't.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.125
The portal will work, I've seen it.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.625
In the future.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.291
Everything repeats itself.

26:54.416 --> 26:57.083
But if I can travel back,
I can change everything.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.458
My older self tried it before,

27:03.083 --> 27:04.875
but this time, everything's different.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.916
I've changed the components
in the passage.

27:10.250 --> 27:11.583
This time, it'll work.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.875
She told you that?

27:14.958 --> 27:16.166
Claudia?

27:18.208 --> 27:20.250
What do you really know about her?

27:22.791 --> 27:24.958
She sometimes disappears for days.

27:26.416 --> 27:28.791
How does she know
all the things she knows?

27:30.583 --> 27:34.541
She said
not everything that's here belongs here.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.875
What did she mean by that?

27:48.833 --> 27:51.333
Come inside.

27:58.125 --> 28:00.083
Claudia's hiding something from us.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.583
We can't trust her.

28:06.291 --> 28:08.000
I hope you know that.

28:26.208 --> 28:28.291
<i>He still doesn't suspect anything?</i>

28:30.208 --> 28:31.208
<i>No.</i>

28:31.958 --> 28:34.666
<i>He has no idea you</i>
<i>or the other world exists.</i>

28:36.500 --> 28:38.625
You must continue
to guide him on his path.

28:39.291 --> 28:42.250
The matter, it must not work yet.

28:42.916 --> 28:46.333
You uphold the knot in your world,
and I'll uphold it in mine.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.041
Wait.

28:51.750 --> 28:55.375
All these past few years,
the things Eva said I had to do...

28:56.125 --> 28:57.958
Does she know everything that happens?

28:59.833 --> 29:01.458
I was wondering.

29:01.541 --> 29:03.208
Have you ever met her?

29:05.291 --> 29:06.291
Who?

29:09.041 --> 29:10.458
My older self.

29:13.541 --> 29:14.583
No.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.041
I still remember exactly what she said.

29:25.166 --> 29:26.833
"If everything goes right...

29:29.791 --> 29:31.208
Regina will live."

29:35.625 --> 29:37.916
I've thought about that all these years.

29:39.291 --> 29:41.666
I just can't believe
that by that she meant

29:41.750 --> 29:44.458
her suffering was to repeat
over and over forever.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.416
There must be a way to untie the knot...

29:55.458 --> 29:57.583
without destroying all life in it.

29:59.833 --> 30:01.500
A way for Regina to live.

30:02.708 --> 30:03.833
Really live.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.291
I think
neither Eva nor Adam know that path.

30:07.916 --> 30:09.333
But I'll find it.

30:11.083 --> 30:13.916
In my world or yours.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.166
Don't...

31:48.916 --> 31:50.791
You didn't bring Claudia with you?

31:54.500 --> 31:56.125
Noah is watching her.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.000
We have to be careful.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.208
You must give this to Claudia.

32:33.833 --> 32:36.000
And she must give it to Tannhaus.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.500
She understands

32:42.291 --> 32:44.166
why it's necessary?

32:45.125 --> 32:47.625
Why everything has to happen again?

33:12.291 --> 33:14.375
You have to be strong now, Hanno.

33:15.166 --> 33:16.500
For your father too.

33:47.625 --> 33:48.916
Silja...

33:52.875 --> 33:55.250
Bartosz, we tried everything.

33:58.875 --> 34:00.833
She wanted to name her Agnes.

34:59.083 --> 35:02.375
Tell me about paradise.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.291
Paradise...

35:13.500 --> 35:15.041
is free

35:15.666 --> 35:18.625
of pain and suffering.

35:20.416 --> 35:24.916
Everything we've ever done...

35:26.875 --> 35:28.666
is forgotten there.

36:28.458 --> 36:30.708
The passage will open.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.458
And then...

36:34.541 --> 36:36.250
we will be there.

36:38.625 --> 36:39.666
You,

36:40.583 --> 36:41.666
me...

36:43.416 --> 36:44.708
and Charlotte.

37:38.625 --> 37:39.875
Where is she?

37:42.875 --> 37:44.125
Charlotte?

37:45.500 --> 37:47.000
Where is Charlotte?

37:49.958 --> 37:52.625
All these years,
I wondered what he meant by that.

37:54.041 --> 37:56.583
That we'd be friends before you betray me.

37:56.666 --> 37:59.708
Where's Claudia?
Does she have Charlotte? Did you help her?

38:00.666 --> 38:02.750
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.791
Where is she?

38:12.750 --> 38:14.125
Where's Charlotte?

38:15.125 --> 38:16.708
I don't know.

38:45.125 --> 38:47.500
I wish you all the suffering in the world.

39:38.541 --> 39:41.208
I will find her.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.041
I will bring her back.

39:52.291 --> 39:54.333
I promise I will.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.958
<i>A man can do what he wills,</i>

40:32.916 --> 40:35.958
<i>but he cannot will what he wills.</i>

40:49.666 --> 40:53.375
<i>All the paths we take in our lives,</i>

40:54.125 --> 40:56.791
<i>every decision that we make,</i>

40:56.875 --> 41:01.833
<i>is guided by that which we desire</i>
<i>deep inside ourselves.</i>

41:20.125 --> 41:22.458
<i>We cannot fight that desire.</i>

41:29.291 --> 41:32.000
<i>It determines every one of our deeds,</i>

41:33.416 --> 41:37.583
<i>no matter how grave and unimaginable</i>
<i>they seem.</i>

42:36.000 --> 42:37.250
Hannah?

42:50.041 --> 42:51.250
Silja?

43:02.166 --> 43:03.166
I...

43:05.250 --> 43:06.666
I'm looking for Jonas.

43:10.958 --> 43:12.041
Yes.

43:13.208 --> 43:14.625
He has changed.

43:17.083 --> 43:19.791
Traveling has left its mark on him.

44:22.541 --> 44:23.708
Jonas?

44:46.916 --> 44:48.333
This is my daughter.

44:48.958 --> 44:49.791
Silja.

44:52.916 --> 44:54.583
She's your sister.

45:12.375 --> 45:14.375
How did you find us?

45:23.708 --> 45:25.125
A few days ago...

45:27.083 --> 45:28.833
there was this old woman.

45:31.791 --> 45:34.750
She just showed up on our doorstep.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.541
Eva.

45:41.375 --> 45:42.791
She said...

45:43.583 --> 45:45.250
she knew where you were.

45:49.333 --> 45:51.458
And that you were looking for me.

45:58.208 --> 45:59.625
You're right.

46:02.541 --> 46:04.208
It's all my fault.

46:06.458 --> 46:08.291
I ruined everything.

46:10.333 --> 46:11.958
But now I'm here.

46:14.375 --> 46:16.166
I'm here, Jonas.

46:38.875 --> 46:39.875
Bartosz.

46:40.833 --> 46:42.583
Prepare the chamber for them.

48:00.666 --> 48:02.208
What are you doing?

48:32.125 --> 48:33.291
Silja.

48:34.541 --> 48:36.333
She doesn't belong here.

48:37.541 --> 48:39.166
What's that supposed to mean?

48:41.208 --> 48:42.958
"She doesn't belong here"?

48:47.750 --> 48:50.750
All the pieces have to be in position.

48:52.791 --> 48:54.333
She's in the wrong place.

48:55.458 --> 48:56.583
So are you.

49:12.708 --> 49:13.791
Mom.

50:31.333 --> 50:33.125
I want to show you a secret.

50:36.083 --> 50:38.166
But we'll let your mom sleep, okay?

50:41.291 --> 50:42.375
Come on.

51:55.125 --> 51:56.416
I...

51:58.208 --> 51:59.875
I have traveled far.

52:00.750 --> 52:02.958
I need a place to sleep.

52:05.291 --> 52:06.208
Hanno?

52:12.916 --> 52:14.666
Prepare the chamber for this gentleman.

52:53.333 --> 52:56.416
I was wondering when you'd come.

53:12.166 --> 53:14.750
I know you think I lied to you.

53:16.375 --> 53:18.875
That I took Charlotte away from you.

53:21.291 --> 53:22.875
But I didn't.

53:24.166 --> 53:25.875
You were right.

53:26.458 --> 53:27.708
Claudia...

53:29.083 --> 53:30.875
she lied to all of us.

53:35.958 --> 53:37.291
The book...

53:38.625 --> 53:40.208
Do you have it with you?

53:51.958 --> 53:53.833
Are the last pages missing?

53:55.583 --> 53:57.291
You must find the last pages.

53:58.333 --> 54:02.000
They will lead you to Charlotte
and to your final destination.

54:04.208 --> 54:06.625
You will find your paradise.

54:08.500 --> 54:09.708
And Helge...

54:10.791 --> 54:12.416
will help you do so.

54:27.875 --> 54:30.541
Everything in life happens in cycles.

54:32.625 --> 54:34.041
Sunset

54:34.833 --> 54:36.583
is followed by sunrise,

54:36.666 --> 54:37.875
over and over.

54:39.958 --> 54:41.666
But this time...

54:42.875 --> 54:45.166
it will be the last cycle.

54:46.250 --> 54:48.750
Are you ready, Noah?

54:58.291 --> 54:59.750
The matter,

55:00.333 --> 55:02.791
it can finally be stabilized.

55:03.291 --> 55:05.958
Everything must happen again
in exactly the same way.

55:07.791 --> 55:11.375
You have to lead your younger self
down the same path.

55:11.458 --> 55:13.083
He must not act differently.

55:13.166 --> 55:14.375
MISSING
MIKKEL NIELSEN

55:14.458 --> 55:17.666
You have to set the course,
no matter how hard that may seem.

55:17.750 --> 55:20.833
But you'll finally be able
to change everything.

55:20.916 --> 55:24.125
WINDEN WELCOMES ITS NEW MINISTER

55:26.333 --> 55:27.708
The device...

55:28.791 --> 55:30.541
He'll repair it.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.083
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

55:39.166 --> 55:42.875
You must destroy the passage,
and the knot with it.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.500
You'll succeed this time.

55:54.333 --> 55:55.583
Jonas...

55:59.166 --> 56:01.416
You must never lose hope.

56:48.458 --> 56:50.208
POLICE

56:50.291 --> 56:53.291
<i>Weeks ago, in the small town of Winden,</i>

56:53.375 --> 56:55.875
<i>a 15-year-old boy</i>
<i>disappeared mysteriously.</i>

56:56.666 --> 57:00.666
<i>Residents are now alarmed</i>
<i>after a second child has gone missing.</i>

57:00.750 --> 57:03.916
<i>Eleven-year-old Mikkel</i>
<i>has been missing for two days.</i>

57:04.250 --> 57:07.041
<i>Report any information</i>
<i>you may have to the Winden police.</i>

57:09.500 --> 57:10.916
Hello, Claudia.

57:28.708 --> 57:29.958
Don't you want to get in?

57:34.208 --> 57:35.416
You have to stop Adam.

57:43.708 --> 57:46.000
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

58:11.958 --> 58:13.291
Have we met?

58:14.500 --> 58:15.916
I'm sorry.

58:20.708 --> 58:23.791
<i>You are the white devil.</i>

58:28.958 --> 58:31.041
JUNE 27, 2020
BEGINNING OF THE LAST CYCLE

58:35.625 --> 58:36.833
Charlotte?

58:38.000 --> 58:39.833
No, this can't be true.

58:40.583 --> 58:41.666
Mom.

58:46.583 --> 58:47.458
Jonas.

58:52.125 --> 58:54.291
I've looked for you all these years.

58:54.375 --> 58:56.041
You are not my father.

58:57.541 --> 58:58.750
Regina?

59:02.625 --> 59:04.000
I'm so sorry.

59:06.291 --> 59:07.625
You used me.

59:15.500 --> 59:17.708
<i>There is no man without guilt.</i>

59:18.625 --> 59:22.250
None of them deserve
a place in your paradise.

59:34.875 --> 59:36.041
Jonas?

59:49.291 --> 59:51.125
And so the circle closes.

59:57.333 --> 59:59.041
What about Martha?

1:00:56.375 --> 1:00:58.125
Why did you bring me here?

1:01:01.083 --> 1:01:03.208
They're the only ones who'll save us.

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:06.250
Save us?

1:01:07.541 --> 1:01:10.458
Everything that's happened is their fault.

1:01:12.416 --> 1:01:13.416
No.

1:01:15.125 --> 1:01:16.500
They are the light.

1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:33.000
What do you want from me?

1:01:36.166 --> 1:01:37.916
Isn't it peculiar...

1:01:39.250 --> 1:01:41.416
that one feels the greatest aversion

1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:44.041
towards the people
who are most similar to oneself?

1:01:45.041 --> 1:01:46.541
I'm not like you.

1:01:48.208 --> 1:01:50.416
You and I have nothing in common.

1:01:52.416 --> 1:01:54.416
My whole life, I believed

1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:58.708
that this moment
could never repeat itself.

1:01:59.333 --> 1:02:00.958
That I could never do

1:02:01.041 --> 1:02:03.000
what my older self had done.

1:02:04.125 --> 1:02:06.208
Because I couldn't understand

1:02:06.791 --> 1:02:09.916
how I could ever want what she wanted.

1:02:10.875 --> 1:02:11.958
But now...

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:16.000
66 years later, I understand.

1:02:22.541 --> 1:02:25.291
Some pain is never forgotten.

1:02:26.791 --> 1:02:29.583
It brands us for our entire life.

1:02:30.666 --> 1:02:32.166
You and I...

1:02:33.375 --> 1:02:34.833
we share that pain.

1:02:35.750 --> 1:02:37.625
We bear the same scars.

1:02:52.625 --> 1:02:54.041
A memento.

1:02:55.916 --> 1:02:59.708
So you never forget
which side you really belong on.

1:03:02.291 --> 1:03:06.916
You may not understand yet,
but choosing us is choosing life.

1:03:08.833 --> 1:03:10.833
Choosing Adam is choosing death.

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:16.500
No!

1:03:17.291 --> 1:03:18.333
No!

1:03:24.958 --> 1:03:26.000
No!

1:04:24.375 --> 1:04:25.833
This can't be.

1:04:36.875 --> 1:04:38.166
Hello, Jonas.

1:08:28.458 --> 1:08:31.583
