what I was wearing,</i>

13:17.672 --> 13:20.140
What time it was,
where I was staying...

13:20.208 --> 13:22.242
<i>I know how it sounds.</i>

13:22.310 --> 13:24.744
But believe me,
if you can imagine it,

13:24.811 --> 13:26.045
It's possible.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.947
If that's true,

13:29.014 --> 13:31.315
If they were trying to find you,

13:31.383 --> 13:33.650
Why didn't they just come for
you last night? I-I don't know.

13:33.717 --> 13:36.351
These are not your
ordinary bad guys.

13:37.553 --> 13:39.287
The tissue is very pink.

13:39.355 --> 13:41.089
Yes, and it's not
normally like that.

13:41.157 --> 13:43.691
It only happens when our
bodies metabolize adrenaline.

13:43.759 --> 13:45.993
So her adrenal's must have
spiked right before she died.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.996
Oh...My god.

13:57.271 --> 13:58.672
"find the crack"?

13:58.740 --> 14:01.542
That is the worst police
slogan I've ever heard.

14:01.610 --> 14:02.776
It's not a slogan.

14:02.844 --> 14:05.011
<i>In the darkness,</i>

14:05.079 --> 14:08.013
There's always a crack.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.549
It's how the light gets in.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.551
<i>Ferguson gave it to me...</i>

14:13.619 --> 14:15.686
Ur first case together.

14:15.754 --> 14:18.455
Nobody else thought I
could hack it, but...

14:20.958 --> 14:24.260
It's--it's an inside joke.

14:24.328 --> 14:25.394
It looks expensive.

14:25.462 --> 14:27.029
Yeah.

14:27.097 --> 14:28.797
That's what he keeps telling me.

14:30.499 --> 14:34.302
[fax whirs, beeps]

14:37.639 --> 14:39.706
If that's an accurate
account of your statement,

14:39.774 --> 14:41.908
Please sign it.

14:41.976 --> 14:45.044
It is, very.

14:45.112 --> 14:47.446
I'm gonna get a room at
the northwest passage.

14:47.514 --> 14:50.048
I'll be staying
under the name of...

14:50.116 --> 14:51.816
Gene cowan.

14:51.884 --> 14:53.684
So if you need me,
that's where I'm at.

14:53.752 --> 14:55.652
You sure you don't
want a police escort?

14:55.720 --> 14:56.987
[laughing] no, I'll be fine.

14:57.055 --> 14:59.122
You know, you say that
there are people out ther

14:59.190 --> 15:01.257
Cutting people's
brains out to find you,

15:01.325 --> 15:02.558
<i>And you're smiling.</i>

15:02.626 --> 15:03.959
Look, they may have found me.

15:04.027 --> 15:05.928
But now that I know
they're here for sure,

15:05.995 --> 15:07.396
I found them too.

15:07.463 --> 15:09.164
And now we're gonna catch 'em.

15:14.836 --> 15:15.837
What?

15:17.140 --> 15:18.740
I don't know about
this guy, ann.

15:18.808 --> 15:20.242
He knew his way around there.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.110
He's like a medical examiner.

15:22.178 --> 15:24.912
He knew the brain,
biology, medications.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.280
Doesn't mean he's legit.

15:26.348 --> 15:28.715
You read your books
about ufos and roswell

15:28.783 --> 15:30.550
And whacked-out theories and
government conspiracies.

15:30.618 --> 15:32.952
I think that you
want to believe.

15:32.986 --> 15:34.653
What makes you trust him?

15:34.721 --> 15:37.122
I don't know.

15:37.190 --> 15:39.357
I'm a good judge of character.

15:41.794 --> 15:43.628
I'm the only one
here who likes you.

15:43.695 --> 15:46.296
[chuckles]

15:46.364 --> 15:49.435
[door bell buzzing]

15:53.474 --> 15:55.675
Closed. What do you want?

15:57.378 --> 15:59.679
If you open up,
I'll make it worth your while.

16:20.093 --> 16:22.261
[phone ringing]

16:24.731 --> 16:25.764
Mathis?

16:25.832 --> 16:29.200
[electronic static,
distorted voices]

16:30.936 --> 16:33.035
[phone ringing]

16:35.603 --> 16:36.836
What do you want from me?

16:36.904 --> 16:37.837
<i>Peter...</i>

16:37.905 --> 16:39.038
It's mathis.

16:39.106 --> 16:41.140
Who did you tell?

16:41.208 --> 16:42.708
What are you talking about?

16:42.776 --> 16:44.376
Just now, I got one
of those phone calls.

16:44.444 --> 16:45.777
They know where I'm staying.

16:45.845 --> 16:47.946
<i>And I only told you. I didn't--</i>

16:48.013 --> 16:49.280
Then ask your partner!

16:49.348 --> 16:51.815
That's what I'm
calling about, peter.

16:51.883 --> 16:53.650
Ferguson's--

16:53.717 --> 16:56.185
Ferguson's disappeared.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.425
<i>When was the last time that
you spoke with him?</i>

17:04.527 --> 17:06.127
About two hours.

17:06.195 --> 17:08.696
He went back to the scene
where krista's body was found.

17:08.763 --> 17:10.298
He felt we might have
missed something.

17:10.366 --> 17:11.766
That means that he disappeared

17:11.833 --> 17:14.068
About a half hour before I
got the last phone call.

17:15.737 --> 17:17.971
You think they used
him to find you,

17:18.038 --> 17:21.339
Like they used krista.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.742
What is it that
makes you special?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.176
Why haven't they taken you?

17:26.244 --> 17:28.311
I don't know.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.147
[scoffs] I don't even
know what it all means,

17:30.215 --> 17:32.915
But I do know that these
people have the answers.

17:32.983 --> 17:34.750
And that's exactly why
I need to find them.

17:34.817 --> 17:36.918
All right, then,
call your friends at the f.B.I.

17:36.985 --> 17:39.019
Let's get these guys! No.

17:39.087 --> 17:40.820
The f.B.I. Has the expertise.

17:40.888 --> 17:42.854
They have the resources.
And if we call the f.B.I.,

17:42.922 --> 17:44.522
They're gonna descend
on this place,

17:44.590 --> 17:46.524
And these people will disappear.

17:46.592 --> 17:48.361
I am this close.

17:48.429 --> 17:51.532
And I am going to
get my answers.

17:53.468 --> 17:55.369
You said you got
calls at drake's bay

17:55.436 --> 17:56.903
And northwest passage, right?

17:56.971 --> 17:59.372
Yes.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.640
Mm-hmm.

18:00.708 --> 18:03.242
Well, we pulled
those phone records.

18:03.310 --> 18:06.446
Those calls never happened.

18:11.651 --> 18:13.952
These people can pull
memories out of brain tissue.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.887
You think they can't make a
couple of calls disappear?

18:15.954 --> 18:17.055
I can do that.

18:17.122 --> 18:19.125
People have been doing
that since the '70s.

18:22.763 --> 18:25.064
I understand.

18:25.131 --> 18:27.532
You don't want me to be right,

18:27.600 --> 18:29.000
'cause if I'm right,

18:29.068 --> 18:31.637
Then that means your partner
is most likely dead.

18:31.705 --> 18:33.071
Hey...

18:33.139 --> 18:35.240
Peter...

18:35.308 --> 18:37.308
With the exception
of who you are,

18:37.376 --> 18:40.579
I haven't been able to verify
anything you've said to me.

18:40.646 --> 18:43.414
It's all either classified,
or it's incredible.

18:43.482 --> 18:46.083
I'm calling the bureau.

18:46.151 --> 18:48.651
Your partner did disappear.

18:48.719 --> 18:51.784
And I did talk to krista.

18:51.852 --> 18:55.216
And I did get those phone calls.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.787
What if he's alive?

19:10.789 --> 19:12.122
What if he's out
there somewhere,

19:12.190 --> 19:14.792
Thinking I am doing
everything in my power,

19:14.859 --> 19:17.729
Including calling the f.
B.I., to save him?

19:17.796 --> 19:19.264
Then that is all the more reason

19:19.332 --> 19:21.467
For us to find him ourselves.

19:21.534 --> 19:23.068
If youake that phone call,

19:23.135 --> 19:26.336
We never will.

run out of pudding pops?

21:30.647 --> 21:32.748
Yes, if you need them.

21:32.815 --> 21:36.483

care for myself.

If peter doesn't come back--

21:40.587 --> 21:43.656
Walter...

21:43.723 --> 21:46.958
They'll send me back to
the hospital, won't they?

21:47.026 --> 21:50.127
I won't let that happen.

24:41.816 --> 24:43.216
There is blood on my jacket

Because there is
blood on my wrist,

I'm sorry.

From your point of view-- I mean,
I was there once too.

You just did it.

You just questioned
your own sanity.

time you slept?

26:22.197 --> 26:23.931
I'm not hallucinating.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.365
And I'm not paranoid.

26:25.433 --> 26:27.900
And I'm not questioning
my own sanity.

26:27.967 --> 26:31.903
I was wondering why you
would listen to me.

26:33.506 --> 26:34.738
You're desperate.

26:38.142 --> 26:41.244
Ferguson is more than just
your partner, isn't he?

between the two of you.

You said back at the
precinct that...

26:54.623 --> 26:56.424
That I was trying to rationalize

26:56.492 --> 26:58.026
That he was still alive.

26:59.629 --> 27:01.432
You may be right.

27:01.499 --> 27:04.769
I may be doing it right now.
He may be dead.

27:06.905 --> 27:09.773
But I won't believe it
until I see his body.

27:13.843 --> 27:15.477
I can't.

27:17.979 --> 27:20.414
[cell phone ringing]

27:20.481 --> 27:22.082
Mathis.

27:38.736 --> 27:40.203
You want me to go look?

27:46.411 --> 27:48.212
[sighs]

27:58.089 --> 27:59.188
Sheriff.

27:59.255 --> 28:00.655
<i>The victim's a white female.</i>

28:00.723 --> 28:02.155
<i>She has part of her
skull missing.</i>

28:02.223 --> 28:04.851
[sighs]

28:10.623 --> 28:13.123
I don't recognize this girl.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.556
You never seen her before?

28:14.624 --> 28:16.489
No, I've never seen her before.

28:16.557 --> 28:18.558
Who is she?

28:20.093 --> 28:22.561
I talked to gwynn right
before her shift ended.

28:22.629 --> 28:24.663
We'd talked about her
coming over last night

28:24.731 --> 28:27.166
To help me color my hair.

28:27.233 --> 28:30.069
I figured she just got tired.

28:30.136 --> 28:32.471
[crying] I should
have called her.

28:32.539 --> 28:35.407
You couldn't have known.

28:35.475 --> 28:36.875
I'm sorry.

28:36.943 --> 28:40.345
Did your sister ever hang
out at the hilltop cafe?

28:40.413 --> 28:42.147
Um... I don't think so.

28:42.215 --> 28:44.349
What about the mosser
brothers gas station

28:44.417 --> 28:45.584
<i>Out on route 202?</i>

28:45.652 --> 28:47.086
<i>I filled up there on the
way into town.</i>

28:47.153 --> 28:48.353
Her pickup's a diesel,

28:48.421 --> 28:50.055
And I don't think
mosser's carries diesel.

28:50.123 --> 28:51.356
Fine, what about the
drake's bay motel?

28:51.424 --> 28:52.790
Would she ever go
there for any reason?

28:52.858 --> 28:54.258
<i>Peter... What's this about?</i>

28:54.326 --> 28:55.292
<i>It's just...</i>

28:55.360 --> 28:57.826
Part of our investigation.

28:57.894 --> 29:00.326
<i>If you could just write down
your address for us.</i>

29:05.762 --> 29:07.960
She is grieving,

29:08.028 --> 29:10.260
And you are not
getting anywhere.

29:17.403 --> 29:19.406
[exhaling sharply]

29:22.910 --> 29:25.144
[crackling]

29:25.212 --> 29:28.380
* *

29:28.448 --> 29:30.716
The hadron super collider
is less complicated

29:30.783 --> 29:32.384
Than that infernal dishwater.

29:32.451 --> 29:34.519
Next time, don't use
laundry detergent,

29:34.586 --> 29:36.287
And the dishwasher
will work fine.

29:36.355 --> 29:37.354
Thank you, astrid.

29:37.422 --> 29:38.722
You're a federal agent.

29:38.790 --> 29:41.725
I doubt, during your
years of training,

29:41.792 --> 29:43.960
That you had dreams
of babysitting

29:44.027 --> 29:45.361
A helpless old man.

29:46.796 --> 29:48.030
You are not that helpless.

29:48.097 --> 29:50.732
<i>A little disorganized, maybe.</i>

29:50.800 --> 29:54.435
Don't you usually keep
this in the bathtub?

29:58.540 --> 30:00.006
<i>Walter?</i>

30:00.074 --> 30:03.276
I took this little car
from the zelazney building.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.544
Objects from the other
universe like this

30:05.612 --> 30:07.046
Emit a glimmer,

30:07.113 --> 30:09.581
A distinctive energy signature.

30:09.649 --> 30:12.584
It may be possible to
detect that signature.

30:12.652 --> 30:13.585
So?

30:13.652 --> 30:15.253
So I need you to gather

30:15.321 --> 30:16.588
All the objects
from the other side

30:16.655 --> 30:18.156
That we recovered from
the zelazney building

30:18.224 --> 30:20.658
And from jacksonville and bring
them to the lab. Okay, why?

30:20.726 --> 30:23.694
To build a device to read
that energy signature!

30:23.762 --> 30:26.329
Peter emits the same energy,
don't you see?

30:26.397 --> 30:28.797
This is how we will find peter.

30:33.068 --> 30:35.169
I must have seen
gwynn somewhere,

30:35.236 --> 30:36.537
Or she had to have seen me.

30:36.604 --> 30:38.338
I mean...

30:38.406 --> 30:40.173
She has to have had
some value to them,

30:40.241 --> 30:41.708
Some knowledge that they needed.

30:41.775 --> 30:43.509
We'll go to your motel
and get your things,

30:43.577 --> 30:46.078
Get you something to eat, and...

30:46.146 --> 30:49.114
You can stay at
my house tonight.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.950
It's okay. I'll be fine.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.552
You're my only connection
to finding bill right now.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.854
I want you safe.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.758
What color was gwynn's truck?

31:01.826 --> 31:03.326
Tan brown.

31:21.243 --> 31:23.510
Driver's side window
is rolled down.

31:28.614 --> 31:31.282
<i>Glove compartment's open.</i>

31:31.349 --> 31:34.483
Okay, so this girl
pulls over her truck,

31:34.551 --> 31:35.651
Rolls down the window,

31:35.718 --> 31:37.786
And then opens up the glove box.

31:37.853 --> 31:39.387
You tell me-
why would she do that?

31:39.454 --> 31:41.321
She got pulled over by a cop.

31:41.389 --> 31:43.423
Or someone pretending
to be a cop--or bill.

31:43.490 --> 31:45.324
Pretending to be bill?

31:45.392 --> 31:47.459
Well, these shape-shifters,
they take on the appearance

31:47.526 --> 31:50.060
Of people in positions
of authority.

31:52.162 --> 31:53.496
Where you going?

31:53.563 --> 31:56.065
I'm calling the f.B.I.

31:56.132 --> 31:57.734
Why?

31:57.802 --> 32:00.504
First, you said they
cut out his brain

32:00.572 --> 32:02.109
To find you.

32:02.177 --> 32:04.783
Now you're telling me he may
have been shape-shifted?

32:04.851 --> 32:06.285
Which is it, peter?

32:06.353 --> 32:09.154
Did I make a mistake
not calling the f.B.I.?

32:11.892 --> 32:13.527
[sighs]

32:13.595 --> 32:16.699
I am very scared right now.

32:25.006 --> 32:25.939
Wait, wai--wait.

32:26.007 --> 32:27.840
<i>Just hold on for one second.</i>

32:27.908 --> 32:29.041
<i>Those people,
when they were taken,</i>

32:29.109 --> 32:30.476
They must have
been afraid, right?

32:30.543 --> 32:32.344
And when they were killed,
they must have been terrified.

32:32.411 --> 32:33.478
So?

32:33.545 --> 32:36.380
So I know how to find them.

32:41.767 --> 32:43.319
Do you know how airplanes
have blackboxes?

32:43.929 --> 32:45.362
To record flight data, sure.

32:45.430 --> 32:48.164
Yeah, well, human bodies
collect data as well.

32:48.232 --> 32:50.666
Both krista and
gwynn's muscle tissue

32:50.734 --> 32:52.234
Was flooded with adrenaline.

32:52.301 --> 32:53.502
Yeah, I remember.

32:53.569 --> 32:55.303
Well, the tissue would've
partially metabolized

32:55.370 --> 32:56.704
The adrenaline.

32:56.772 --> 32:59.172
So we should be able to measure
the rate of absorption,

32:59.240 --> 33:02.008
Which will tell us when the
adrenaline was first produced.

33:02.076 --> 33:03.509
<i>What about newton?</i>

33:03.577 --> 33:05.878
<i>How does that help us find him?
Look...</i>

33:05.945 --> 33:07.746
Normally,

33:07.814 --> 33:10.882
Your adrenaline levels are flat.

33:10.949 --> 33:13.050
Then you experience fear.

33:13.117 --> 33:15.018
A spike in adrenaline.

33:15.085 --> 33:17.787
Sometime later,
you experience more fear,

33:17.854 --> 33:19.855
Say, in the moments right
before you were killed--

33:19.923 --> 33:22.758
Another spike,
two points of fear.

33:22.825 --> 33:24.792
Now, we already know where
the girls were abducted.

33:24.860 --> 33:26.894
So if we can just determine
how much time took place

33:26.962 --> 33:28.328
Between these two intervals...

33:28.396 --> 33:30.365
Then we can figure out
where they were killed.

33:30.432 --> 33:32.705
Exactly right.

33:32.772 --> 33:34.274
<i>There is one more thing.</i>

33:34.342 --> 33:36.512
<i>We're gonna need a
control sample.</i>

33:38.015 --> 33:40.951
Can you stick that
in the centrifuge?

33:41.018 --> 33:43.220
It's that thing
right over there.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.422
Ah.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.893
Hey! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.960
I just needed to scare you.

33:55.932 --> 33:57.900
[zipper opens]

34:00.904 --> 34:04.037
I'm gonna need to take a
tissue sample from you.

34:07.674 --> 34:09.341
(broyles) how is dr.
Bishop doing?

34:09.409 --> 34:11.010
Walter's trying to adjust

34:11.077 --> 34:12.911
To a very difficult situation.

34:12.978 --> 34:16.947
He's concerned about being
sent back to st. Claire's.

34:21.420 --> 34:23.989
Will he be able to function
if peter doesn't come back?

34:25.558 --> 34:27.792
I'm sure that peter
will come back.

34:34.835 --> 34:36.768
Do you know something?

34:41.072 --> 34:44.108
Have you spoken to him?

34:44.176 --> 34:46.643
Krista manning's adrenaline
spikes were 42 minutes apart.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.110
So assuming that newton
drove the speed limit,

34:48.179 --> 34:49.145
60 miles an hour--

34:49.213 --> 34:50.480
On these roads,

34:50.547 --> 34:51.947
That'd be a good
way to get killed.

34:52.014 --> 34:54.014
He would have stuck to 45.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.717
All right, 45.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.889
Okay, the center point is
where krista was taken.

35:02.693 --> 35:04.760
At 45 miles per hour,

35:04.828 --> 35:06.028
The farthest they
could have gone

35:06.095 --> 35:07.729
Would be 31 1/2 miles.

35:07.797 --> 35:11.332
Gwynn, our second victim...

35:11.399 --> 35:12.999
Was taken much
farther out of town,

35:13.067 --> 35:14.768
Almost on the other
side of the county.

35:14.835 --> 35:17.036
Her adrenaline spikes
are 57 minutes apart.

35:17.104 --> 35:20.906
Again, factoring 45
miles per hour...

35:23.075 --> 35:24.776
That's it.

35:24.844 --> 35:26.211
That's our kill zone.

35:26.279 --> 35:28.280
You're assuming he
killed them both

35:28.348 --> 35:29.649
In the same place.

35:29.716 --> 35:31.151
They were using complex
medical equipment.

35:31.219 --> 35:32.719
It's not easy to move
an operating room.

35:32.787 --> 35:34.055
Much simpler to just
bring the victims

35:34.122 --> 35:35.123
To a specified location--

35:35.191 --> 35:36.758
Someplace out of the way.

35:36.826 --> 35:39.395
Like an old dairy farm?

35:41.631 --> 35:44.633
[clattering]

35:56.905 --> 36:00.240
<i>Just ask him something
only he would know.</i>

36:01.542 --> 36:02.908
<i>Hello, there.</i>

36:02.974 --> 36:04.807
It's, uh, craig, right?

36:04.875 --> 36:06.739
Yeah. I don't know
if you remember,

36:06.807 --> 36:08.838
But, uh, I think
you were in choir

36:08.906 --> 36:10.739
With my sister up at st.
Andrew's.

36:10.807 --> 36:12.641
Well, actually,
I was at good shepherd.

36:12.708 --> 36:14.442
<i>Good memory, though.</i>

36:14.510 --> 36:15.877
Yeah, good shepherd-
that's right.

36:15.945 --> 36:17.880
So, uh, what can I do for you?

36:17.949 --> 36:19.516
Your old dairy farm up the hill.

36:19.584 --> 36:22.585
Could there be people up there?

36:22.653 --> 36:25.521
People? Yeah,
you get up there often?

36:25.589 --> 36:27.824
<i>No, not much,
since we shut it down.</i>

36:27.892 --> 36:29.759
Why?

36:29.826 --> 36:32.827
Okay, we got 12 outbuildings--

36:32.895 --> 36:34.027
The milking parlors,

36:34.095 --> 36:35.762
The barn,
and the holding stalls.

36:35.830 --> 36:37.731
<i>Those are all good
places to hide.</i>

36:37.798 --> 36:40.600
That's a lot of ground to cover.

36:40.667 --> 36:44.002
I'll go call backup to
help with the search.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.446
<i>Need any help with the search?</i>

36:56.514 --> 36:59.048
I think it's best
if you stay here.

36:59.116 --> 37:00.583
Let me get you the keys.

37:00.651 --> 37:01.917
Sure.

37:26.713 --> 37:28.313
Uhh! Ohh!

37:29.715 --> 37:32.282
Uhh! Uhh!

37:32.350 --> 37:33.316
Unh! Uhh! Uh!

37:33.384 --> 37:35.051
Who are you? Where's newton?

37:36.353 --> 37:38.854
Peter, stop!

37:42.857 --> 37:44.424
<i>I couldn't stop.</i>

37:44.491 --> 37:46.726
<i>The girls--I wanted to
be close to them.</i>

37:46.793 --> 37:48.994
I just couldn't stop.

37:49.062 --> 37:50.562
Where is he?

37:50.630 --> 37:52.130
<i>Where's ferguson?</i>

37:52.198 --> 37:54.332
What did you do to him?

38:01.272 --> 38:03.507
Bill?

38:07.678 --> 38:08.944
<i>Bill?</i>

38:15.751 --> 38:17.852
<i>Peter...</i>

38:21.123 --> 38:22.723
[door creaks]

38:24.291 --> 38:26.526
Bill!

38:26.593 --> 38:28.762
Bill...

38:28.830 --> 38:30.699
He's still breathing. Thank god.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.000
Bill.

38:32.068 --> 38:34.336
It's just ink.
There's no incision here.

38:34.404 --> 38:36.204
I'm gonna go call an ambulance.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.338
[crying] bill.

38:37.406 --> 38:38.873
Stay with me, baby.

38:38.941 --> 38:39.940
I'm here.

38:40.008 --> 38:41.375
I'm here now.

38:41.442 --> 38:43.510
I'm here, bill.

38:43.578 --> 38:45.379
[water sloshing]

38:56.426 --> 38:57.760
I don't know what to say.

38:57.827 --> 38:59.495
You saved bill's life,

38:59.562 --> 39:02.230
And you tracked a killer-
what else is there to say?

39:08.671 --> 39:11.640
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

39:14.277 --> 39:17.445
Whatever your experiences are,

39:17.513 --> 39:21.682
Whatever you can't or
won't tell me about...

39:21.750 --> 39:24.285
I think you're looking
for meaning in things

39:24.353 --> 39:27.855
That...Have no meaning.

39:33.828 --> 39:36.730
I don't know who I am anymore.

39:42.471 --> 39:45.006
When I was in college...

39:45.073 --> 39:48.242
My family was killed, murdered.

39:50.579 --> 39:52.313
I'm sorry.

39:54.616 --> 39:56.951
Sometimes I still think...

39:57.018 --> 39:59.620
One day I might catch
whoever did it.

40:02.891 --> 40:05.459
I was alone for a long time.

40:05.527 --> 40:09.895
But I found my place.

40:09.963 --> 40:13.532
You will too.

40:38.924 --> 40:40.625
(walter) once we
isolate the glimmer,

40:40.692 --> 40:42.059
We can find peter.

40:46.763 --> 40:48.864
[computer beeps]

40:53.902 --> 40:55.637
Walter, you put in
the wrong numbers.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.668
No, no, I believe
they're correct.

40:57.736 --> 41:00.404
[keys clacking]

41:00.472 --> 41:02.436
No, they're not.

41:04.733 --> 41:06.795
But, then, you know
that already, don't you?

41:06.862 --> 41:10.788
I thought you wanted
to find peter.

41:10.856 --> 41:13.982
What if he won't
forgive me, astrid?

41:14.050 --> 41:15.978
All I have now is hope--

41:16.046 --> 41:17.675
Hope that he will
come to understand

41:17.742 --> 41:19.173
Why I did the things I did.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.840
What if I find him,
and he won't forgive me?

41:21.908 --> 41:23.942
What do I have then?

41:24.010 --> 41:25.744
[door closes]

41:25.812 --> 41:27.078
Hey. Hey, olivia.

41:27.146 --> 41:29.114
Walter...

41:29.182 --> 41:31.082
I found peter.

41:31.150 --> 41:32.083
W-where?

41:32.151 --> 41:33.217
<i>He's in washington state.</i>

41:33.285 --> 41:34.519
<i>I'm heading to the airport now.</i>

41:34.586 --> 41:37.154
Would you like to
come with me, walter?

41:44.429 --> 41:47.598
I'll need to pack a bag.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.474
