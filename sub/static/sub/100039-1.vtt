01:35.580 --> 01:37.920
He fell,
and I caught the rope.
I took over,

01:37.920 --> 01:39.250
but he's dead weight.
I got no leverage here.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.830

Tie him to an anchor point.

01:48.330 --> 01:49.960

fired me.

02:16.710 --> 02:19.460
Without a word of apology
or regret.

02:19.460 --> 02:23.620
And my own wife said nothing
to defend me,

02:23.620 --> 02:25.380
not one word.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.710
Look, I-I-I know
I have my part in this,

02:28.710 --> 02:31.420
but I do not see me

02:31.420 --> 02:35.380
forgiving anyone but myself
anytime soon.

02:37.380 --> 02:40.040
I did it myself.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.500
I take full responsibility
for my actions.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.000
Andrew DeLuca had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Okay.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.500
Okay.
What now?

02:49.500 --> 02:51.380
We go to the police?

02:51.380 --> 02:53.580
No. Now you go home
and I do what I do.

02:53.580 --> 02:56.170
I go home?

02:56.170 --> 02:57.500
Will they
let Andrew out?

02:57.500 --> 02:59.170
After the charges against him
are dismissed.

02:59.170 --> 03:00.080
And then what?

03:00.080 --> 03:01.500
Well, we'll schedule
a hearing.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.670
You'll be
deeply repentant.

03:03.670 --> 03:05.670
You'll get a few weeks
of community service

03:05.670 --> 03:07.250
at a free clinic,

03:07.250 --> 03:08.420
and you'll pay a fine.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.920
And what about
my medical license?

03:09.920 --> 03:11.420
That's up to the board
if they want to pursue action,

03:11.420 --> 03:13.120
but I'd say
it's highly unlikely.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.210
So I just go home.
Yes.

03:17.420 --> 03:18.750
Is there a problem?
No.

03:18.750 --> 03:21.420
I just -- I did
this long, dramatic goodbye

03:21.420 --> 03:23.540
with my kids.

Link: Well,
this is good, man.

She's getting
the help she needs.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.380
Yeah, well,
it's just --

03:30.380 --> 03:32.250
I have a history
with some people

03:32.250 --> 03:33.710
who had that kind of help,
and it doesn't help.

03:33.710 --> 03:36.080
Jo's not those people,

03:36.080 --> 03:37.040
and she isn't
just a fighter.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.790
She's Rocky.
She's Ali.

03:40.790 --> 03:42.040
She'll get better.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.080
Let's talk about
something else.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.620
I think
Amelia dumped me.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.750
You think?

03:50.750 --> 03:52.330
Little hard to tell.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.790
Hi.

03:57.790 --> 04:00.920
Somebody wants to meet
his baby sister.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.250
Leo, Leo.
Look, look.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.460
This is your little sister,
Allison,

04:04.460 --> 04:08.920
and, Allison, this is your
big brother, Leo.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.290
Leo, being a big brother
is such an important job.

04:12.290 --> 04:15.420
Oh, uh, Hunt, Shepherd,
I have incoming trauma.

04:15.420 --> 04:16.420
Well,
I just had a baby.

04:16.420 --> 04:17.580
He just had a baby.
Yeah.

04:17.580 --> 04:20.290
I'm aware. She's very cute.
Congratulations.

04:20.290 --> 04:22.620
I still need you to come.
Altman, you're excused.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.120
What --
Are you serious?

04:24.120 --> 04:27.500
Due to criminal activity,
Meredith Grey,

04:27.500 --> 04:29.620
Alex Karev, and Richard Webber
no longer work here.

04:29.620 --> 04:30.920
What?

04:30.920 --> 04:32.210
And Andrew DeLuca's
in jail.

04:32.210 --> 04:33.210
What do you mean
"criminal activity"?

04:33.210 --> 04:33.960
Incoming trauma.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.290
Now.

04:35.290 --> 04:36.880
What do you mean
"criminal activi--"

04:36.880 --> 04:37.880
Would you?

04:37.880 --> 04:39.880
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Uh, sure.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.290
Hey. Hi. Okay.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.790
Oh. Oh, boy.

Bye.
We gotta go.
Okay. Yeah. Goodbye.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.290
Okay. Okay.
Okay. I know.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.460
Oh, I...

04:52.460 --> 04:54.380
Hey, help.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.710
Nurse?

04:55.710 --> 04:57.000
Teddy: Let's see.
Look at this. What's this?
Wh--

04:57.000 --> 04:58.790
You --
You had the baby!

05:00.790 --> 05:03.290
I-I tried to reach you.
I-I didn't hear from you.

05:03.290 --> 05:05.620
And then I had the --
the Spidey Sense, and...

05:05.620 --> 05:08.290
Oh.

05:08.290 --> 05:10.460
Look at her.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.620
Wow.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.170
What a beauty.

05:13.170 --> 05:15.920
And that is little Leo Hunt,
am I right?

05:15.920 --> 05:18.170
You must be so tired.
You need a hand?

05:18.170 --> 05:19.920
Come here,
little Leo Hunt.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.330
Come here.

05:21.330 --> 05:22.830
Wait, so, tell me -- What --

05:22.830 --> 05:25.580
So, tell me -- did she get
back together with your daddy?

05:25.580 --> 05:26.750
Is that what she did?

05:26.750 --> 05:28.170
Yes, she did,
didn't she?

05:28.170 --> 05:30.080
Did he ride in
on a white horse

05:30.080 --> 05:32.330
and make
all the right promises?

05:32.330 --> 05:33.880
I think he did. Yes, I do.
That's what I think.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.880
Oh, Tom, please don't --
don't -- don't blame Owen.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.250
This is -- This is me.
This is -- It's my fault.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.250
I'm just --
You know, you are --

05:40.250 --> 05:42.670
You are
such a wonderful man.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.380
Oh -- Oh, I know I am.

05:44.380 --> 05:47.000
I'm funny and I'm smart
and I'm kind when I want to be,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.040
generous with my money
and with my tongue in bed.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.500
So, you will regret
this decision,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.540
and when you do --

05:52.540 --> 05:54.250
I'll still be here

05:54.250 --> 05:57.620
because, uh,
I'm in love with you,

05:57.620 --> 06:00.380
and I don't think this thing
with Hunt's gonna last.

06:00.380 --> 06:03.250
And in the meantime,
we are friends.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.960
Okay?
Ma.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.380
Yeah, do you want me to take
little Leo back to daycare?

06:07.380 --> 06:09.120
Yes, please.
Yeah?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.710
He's crazy about me.

06:10.710 --> 06:12.580
Come on, little Leo.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.540
Let's go back to daycare,
you and me.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.080
You fired them?

06:18.080 --> 06:19.880
What do you suggest
I should have done?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.420
Anything
but fire them.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.460
Mari Prishna, 34,

06:33.620 --> 06:35.290
What do we got?

06:35.290 --> 06:39.120
Jai Prishna, 35, GCS 11,
with a left open femur fracture

06:39.120 --> 06:40.420
and right
lower leg deformity,

06:40.420 --> 06:42.080
secondary to a fall
over a cliff,

06:42.080 --> 06:43.250
thready pulse.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.460
Systolic's in the hundreds.
Okay.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.790
Uh...

06:45.790 --> 06:47.580
Uh,
you two hurt, or...?

06:47.580 --> 06:48.920
No.
No.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.250
We're fine.
We're fine.

07:05.330 --> 07:06.750
And we're good to go.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.580
He wanted
to cut off my leg.
I didn't want to,

07:09.580 --> 07:12.460
I suggested that it was
the safest course of action.

07:12.460 --> 07:13.580
But then
you were wrong.

07:13.580 --> 07:16.170
But then
I was a miracle worker.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.120
After he begged you
and cried.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.290
You love me because
I'm a sensitive guy.

07:21.790 --> 07:23.460
Alright, can we let our interns
do their job now, please?

07:23.460 --> 07:24.620
Qadri?

07:24.620 --> 07:26.460
Mari Prishna, 34,
seven days post-op

07:26.460 --> 07:28.670
after she was
a warrior goddess

07:28.670 --> 07:30.120
and saved
her husband's life.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.330
Dr. Avery
was the warrior.

07:32.330 --> 07:33.330
He saved Jai.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.120
I mean,
if he hadn't come along --

07:35.120 --> 07:37.210
No, Mari,
you caught the rope,

07:37.210 --> 07:40.880
and you held it for hours
on a broken, shredded arm.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.790
You saved his life.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.960
We did a debridement
of her wound

07:44.960 --> 07:47.040
and then put in
a right humeral plate.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.290
So, today will be
her brachial plexus surgery

07:49.290 --> 07:51.120
for definitive
nerve repair.

07:54.460 --> 07:56.120
Uh, I'm checking in my wife --
Josephine Karev.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.460
Guard: You need
to drive around.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.920
You say goodbye there,
she goes in on foot.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.670
I hate
that I did this to you.

08:18.670 --> 08:19.880
Did what?

08:19.880 --> 08:21.040
Became another name

08:21.040 --> 08:24.080
on your list
of crazy women.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.330
Listen, for the record,
you are way saner

08:27.330 --> 08:28.710
than any woman
I've ever dropped off

08:28.710 --> 08:29.670
at a treatment center.

08:32.330 --> 08:34.080
Look,
it's 30 days.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.500
You go in, you talk about
your feelings or whatever,

08:36.500 --> 08:38.880
and I get to come visit you
on Saturdays.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.250
You don't have to.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.750
Alex, we're not even
legally married.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.040
We never filed
a license.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.380
You have an out,

08:48.380 --> 08:51.040
and I guess I'm saying
that I love you enough

08:51.040 --> 08:53.580
to understand
if you want to take it.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.420
Link:
Bipolars, please.

09:27.420 --> 09:29.580
Amelia: Look at
the posterior cord.

09:29.580 --> 09:30.920
I have no idea

09:30.920 --> 09:33.920
how she hung onto her husband
for that many hours.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.670
I'm thinking
I would have let go

09:35.670 --> 09:38.830
at about the 20-minute mark,
if not sooner.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.750
Sounds about right.

09:40.750 --> 09:44.580
Okay, so, clearly,
we have had a misunderstanding.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.000
Can we talk
after surgery?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.670
I'm happy
to talk now.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.670
I'm not
listening.

09:48.670 --> 09:49.830
And I don't
care.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.000
I like you...
a lot.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.250
I would like
to keep seeing you.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.790
What I don't want to do
is bury myself in you.

09:59.790 --> 10:00.790
You know
what I mean?

10:00.790 --> 10:02.250
No,
he doesn't.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.880
He doesn't?
You don't?

10:04.880 --> 10:06.540
Of course he doesn't. You're not
speaking in a language

10:06.540 --> 10:08.880
any dude could
possibly understand.
They're not wrong.

10:10.380 --> 10:13.290
I would like
to go on dates with you

10:13.290 --> 10:16.460
and get to know you better
before I'm all in,

10:16.460 --> 10:20.210
because I have a history
of going all in too fast,

10:20.210 --> 10:22.620
and I would like
to change that.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.040
Better?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.620
Better.
Better.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.040
Better.

10:39.330 --> 10:40.880
Can you
come back later, please?

10:40.880 --> 10:43.000
Okay.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.460
She won't stop crying.
She just --

10:45.460 --> 10:47.170
She won't stop crying!

10:47.170 --> 10:50.170
Alright, Teddy, listen.
This -- This is crazy.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.830
Just come home
with me.
No.

10:51.830 --> 10:54.000
No, I am not
going back home

10:54.000 --> 10:55.330
to the house
that you bought for Amelia.

10:55.330 --> 10:57.040
That's not the way
you and I are supposed to

10:57.040 --> 10:58.330
start our lives
together.

10:58.330 --> 11:00.670
I know it.
I know it in my soul.

11:00.670 --> 11:03.170
What, and this hotel room --
this makes sense to your soul?

11:03.170 --> 11:06.670
My soul
needs a shower,

11:06.670 --> 11:09.880
and our baby
needs a diaper change.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.330
Okay.

11:12.330 --> 11:13.580
Thank you.

11:21.330 --> 11:22.880
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.920
Uh, hello,
I'm, uh, I'm Dr. Webber --

11:31.920 --> 11:34.290
From the health app?
Oh, please, come in.

11:34.290 --> 11:35.540
Okay.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.380
Dumbledore.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.040
Dumbledore, stop that.
Stop it.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.750
Stop that. Stop that.

11:44.790 --> 11:46.210
Sorry about that.
Yeah.

11:46.210 --> 11:48.880
This is Lolly.
Hi, honey.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.580
So, she's got a fever

11:50.580 --> 11:52.460
and a headache
and a sore throat,

11:52.460 --> 11:54.120
and this morning,
we were at the park,

11:54.120 --> 11:55.250
and we were playing.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.040
I'm not really...
sure what happened.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.420
She seemed fine.

12:00.710 --> 12:02.120
Oh, my God.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.040
Well...I guess maybe
she has the flu.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.040
I...

12:05.040 --> 12:07.920
I'd say maybe.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.420
Hey.

12:18.420 --> 12:20.460
Shepherd was able to do
a complete repair

12:20.460 --> 12:21.960
of Mari's nerves.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.790
That's good.
That's good.

12:23.790 --> 12:25.080
How's Jai?

12:25.080 --> 12:27.670
He's improving,
actually.

12:27.670 --> 12:29.420
How's that ankle?

12:29.420 --> 12:31.460
It's a little better.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.460
Good.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.420
How about us?
How are we?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.670
Hmm?

12:35.670 --> 12:37.620
It's been a week,
Maggie.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.250
We agreed...

12:39.250 --> 12:41.460
To let
our tempers settle

12:41.460 --> 12:43.080
before we talked further
about --

12:43.080 --> 12:45.170
You abandoning me
on a dark and foggy road?

12:46.750 --> 12:48.420
That walk that I took --

12:48.420 --> 12:50.500
That walk you took?
...ending up
saving two lives.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.880
Is that what we're calling it
now? That walk you took?

12:52.880 --> 12:55.500
You left me
in a car

12:55.500 --> 12:57.830
on an unfamiliar road
i-in the woods,

12:57.830 --> 12:59.460
surrounded by...

12:59.460 --> 13:01.790
fog and bears
and wolves.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.670
There were no bears.
Why --

13:03.670 --> 13:05.790
None that we could see,
but I could hear them!

13:08.290 --> 13:10.670
This is why
we should wait to talk.

13:10.670 --> 13:13.670
Yeah, got it.

13:13.670 --> 13:16.790
Dr. Grey's bleeding heart
got the better of her,

13:16.790 --> 13:19.290
but she is
an award-winning surgeon.

13:19.290 --> 13:20.540
She saves lives every day,
and she --

13:20.540 --> 13:22.830
Did you bring an actual violin,
counselor?

13:22.830 --> 13:24.290
Judge --
Dr. Grey,

13:24.290 --> 13:27.120
you're a partial owner of
Grey-Sloan Memorial.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.170
So why commit
insurance fraud?

13:29.170 --> 13:31.380
Why not just pay
for the surgery yourself

13:31.380 --> 13:32.460
or do it for free?

13:32.460 --> 13:34.080
Repentant.

13:35.420 --> 13:38.040
Your Honor,
the little girl has cancer.

13:38.040 --> 13:41.670
She needs hundreds of thousands
of dollars' worth of care

13:41.670 --> 13:43.500
over a period
of years,

13:43.500 --> 13:47.080
and I didn't think that her
very proud, hardworking father

13:47.080 --> 13:49.250
would accept charity
from me.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.500
And I didn't think
he should have to.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.920
The system
should've supported them,

13:53.920 --> 13:55.670
and the system
is broken.

13:55.670 --> 13:57.210
Do you regret
your choices?

14:03.540 --> 14:06.210
To the extent
that I can,

14:06.210 --> 14:08.330
knowing there's a very sick
little girl out there,

14:08.330 --> 14:10.330
who's beginning
to feel better.
Klein:
Your Honor --

14:10.330 --> 14:11.500
I've heard enough!

14:11.500 --> 14:12.580
She has three kids.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.540
Don't throw her
in jail.

14:24.540 --> 14:25.960
Mari: Help!
Somebody help my husband!

14:25.960 --> 14:27.380
Help! Help!

14:27.380 --> 14:29.540
Help, help!
Somebody help me! Help!

14:29.540 --> 14:31.540
We were just talking, then
he started acting strange...
Call in a code.

14:31.540 --> 14:33.620
...and he stopped talking,
and I can't wake him up. Jai!

14:33.620 --> 14:34.790
I got a pulse.
Jai,
please wake up.

14:34.790 --> 14:35.880
Nurse:
Rapid response.
Wake up. Jai.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.210
Crash cart
and intubation tray!
Jai.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.040
I'm on it.
Give me the mask.

14:38.040 --> 14:38.750
Wake up.
Please wake up.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.040
Jai.
100% oxygen.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.040
Nurse: Pushing saline.
Please wake up!

14:41.040 --> 14:42.210
Please wake up, Jai.

14:44.710 --> 14:47.290
You put Tom Koracick
in charge of me.

14:47.290 --> 14:48.620
I put him in charge

14:48.620 --> 14:51.250
of all Catherine Fox Foundation
hospitals.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.250
He's Chief of Chiefs.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.580
You said
you would have my back.

14:53.580 --> 14:54.790
I did
have your back.

14:54.790 --> 14:58.000
I sat here silently
while you fired my husband

14:58.000 --> 15:00.250
and two of your most effective
department heads.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.580
Because they had
broken the law!

15:02.580 --> 15:04.920
When I was 15,
I stole a lipstick

15:04.920 --> 15:06.670
just to see
if I could get away with it.

15:06.670 --> 15:07.920
Do you think
that means

15:07.920 --> 15:09.500
I shouldn't
get to practice medicine?

15:09.500 --> 15:10.670
What?

15:10.670 --> 15:12.830
That's a false equivalence,
and you know it!

15:12.830 --> 15:15.460
My husband
is working for an app!

15:15.460 --> 15:19.080
He's making house calls
like it's 1965.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.620
He leaves the house
before I wake,

15:22.620 --> 15:24.750
he goes to sleep at night
before I get home,

15:24.750 --> 15:27.080
and if our paths happen to cross
in the daytime,

15:27.080 --> 15:29.750
he avoids eye contact.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.580
That's what
standing by you cost me --

15:32.580 --> 15:33.960
my marriage.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.750
So Tom Koracick
is my punishment.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.460
I am living
with cancer.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.290
I don't have the energy
I once did.

15:41.290 --> 15:42.830
And all the things
you used to bring to me,

15:42.830 --> 15:44.170
you will now
bring to Tom.

15:44.170 --> 15:46.620
Tom is
a world-class surgeon --
I know what he is.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.620
DeLuca?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.120
You want
to explain yourself?

15:59.120 --> 16:00.620
Yeah, you fired
several doctors,

16:00.620 --> 16:03.290
and other doctors quit
in solidarity.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.290
But I've been cleared
of all my charges,

16:05.290 --> 16:06.670
and I think
you might need my help.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.040
Cocky.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.460
DeLuca.

16:11.460 --> 16:14.120
This...
This is cocky.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.620
You want me to leave?

16:15.620 --> 16:17.120
I can leave.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.120
Just get to work.

16:25.330 --> 16:27.170
You really a doctor?

16:27.170 --> 16:28.670
I might be.

16:28.670 --> 16:30.380
It's still undecided.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.040
What did you do?

16:32.040 --> 16:33.380
Robbed a bank.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.540
Really?

16:34.540 --> 16:35.710
No.

16:35.710 --> 16:37.000
I keyed
my ex-boyfriend's car.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Oh.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Did he deserve it?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.880
Oh,
he very much did.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.920
So,
I got this mole.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.830
Think you could
take a look?

16:52.170 --> 16:53.380
Heard about Jai.

16:53.380 --> 16:57.040
Yeah, radiology says
he has watershed infarcts,

16:57.040 --> 16:58.500
which makes no sense
in this case.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.000
He's 35,
he could do an Ironman,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.580
and he just
strokes out.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.750
Out of nowhere.
Did you do
an echo or a V/Q?

17:03.750 --> 17:05.750
Of course I did,
Maggie.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.750
I...

17:07.750 --> 17:09.040
I'm trying to help.

17:10.710 --> 17:13.290
Jai was hanging on the edge of
a cliff with two shattered legs,

17:13.290 --> 17:16.040
and Mari hung onto him.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.040
She hung on so hard

17:18.040 --> 17:19.710
that a tree sliced through
the nerves in her arm

17:19.710 --> 17:21.540
and almost cut it off.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.880
But she hung on,

17:22.880 --> 17:25.380
pulled him
from the brink,

17:25.380 --> 17:27.790
like the edge of
certain death.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.710
And then we show up
and we bring him back here

17:29.710 --> 17:31.540
and we put him through
excruciating surgeries,

17:31.540 --> 17:35.790
and now he's on...
life support,

17:35.790 --> 17:39.120
somewhere between
alive and dead.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.790
So, I'm wondering
if she should have...

17:42.790 --> 17:43.750
back at
that cliffside,

17:43.750 --> 17:45.750
if she should have
just...

17:45.750 --> 17:48.250
let him go.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.120
Because there's
something inside him

17:50.120 --> 17:51.920
that we can't find.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.290
Hell,
we can't even name it.

17:53.290 --> 17:55.670
There's something there
that's broken

17:55.670 --> 17:59.750
beyond...repair.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.580
In this metaphor,

18:04.580 --> 18:06.290
am I the thing
that is broken beyond repair?

18:06.290 --> 18:08.920
Am I the thing that,
um...

18:08.920 --> 18:10.920
should just be
thrown over a cliff now?

18:10.920 --> 18:11.920
No.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.920
No.
Not you, Maggie.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.790
Us.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.500
So, you're still
broken up?

18:28.500 --> 18:29.500
That's sticking?

18:29.500 --> 18:32.670
It's very,
very sticking.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.960
I think I deserve
better than someone

18:34.960 --> 18:36.790
who regularly
abandons me

18:36.790 --> 18:38.790
for, you know,
trees.

18:38.790 --> 18:40.620
Amelia: Right?
So, yeah,
it's sticking.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.880
You're okay,
right? I mean...

18:41.880 --> 18:43.170
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

18:43.170 --> 18:44.460
We're fine.
I mean, we're friends.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.960
Our parents are married
to one another.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.880
So, yeah.
Friends.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.880
Or like siblings.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.330
We're definitely not
like siblings.

18:54.620 --> 18:56.960
Mommy, can I wear this
to school?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.790
No.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.620
Because Mommy needs that
for...work.

19:03.670 --> 19:06.290
Maggie:

19:15.250 --> 19:18.250
Aren't you
supposed to be in there?

19:18.250 --> 19:20.710
They tried
to take a selfie.

19:20.710 --> 19:24.330
They climbed all the way
to the top of a mountain.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.000
They made it up
through rain and fog,

19:27.000 --> 19:28.540
and then they tried
to take a selfie,

19:28.540 --> 19:30.500
and he stepped back
and slipped.

19:31.830 --> 19:34.080
He was a miracle,
and now he's...

19:36.420 --> 19:38.920
...not.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.580
And we don't know why.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.380
And that...

19:43.880 --> 19:45.420
Just --

19:45.420 --> 19:47.380
It hurts my body.
It makes me ache.

19:55.210 --> 19:57.040
Hey.
You okay?

19:57.040 --> 19:58.080
Uh, yeah.
Baby?

19:58.080 --> 19:59.380
Oh, she's fine,
I think,

19:59.380 --> 20:00.920
but, um,
I don't know where Teddy is.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.540
Have you seen her?

20:02.540 --> 20:04.710
Uh, she panics and she brings
the baby here sometimes.

20:04.710 --> 20:05.960
Why?

20:05.960 --> 20:07.580
Because she doesn't
trust me.

20:07.580 --> 20:09.920
B-Because everything I do,
everything I say, is wrong.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.580
New baby.
That's hard.

20:11.580 --> 20:12.960
Yeah.
Oh, God.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.960
When we got Leo, it was hard,
but it wasn't this hard.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.380
No, motherhood is hard
no matter what,

20:16.380 --> 20:17.710
but giving birth
is a beast.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.790
I mean, it's a beast
that changes your whole body

20:19.790 --> 20:22.380
and your whole mind
and your whole heart forever.

20:22.380 --> 20:25.380
Hormones are insane,
so just be patient.

20:25.380 --> 20:27.250
Yeah.

20:28.380 --> 20:29.710
I offered
to milk her.

20:29.710 --> 20:31.670
What?

20:31.670 --> 20:33.790
She had a clogged duct
and she was in pain,

20:33.790 --> 20:35.670
and I -- her --
the heat pads weren't working.

20:35.670 --> 20:37.420
I just --
So you offered
to milk her?

20:37.420 --> 20:38.790
Yeah.

20:38.790 --> 20:39.620
In those exact words?

20:39.620 --> 20:41.080
Yeah.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.120
Wh--

20:43.120 --> 20:45.080
I was just
trying to help!

20:45.080 --> 20:47.460
What?

20:47.460 --> 20:49.500
And you said you are available
to start immediately?

20:49.500 --> 20:50.750
I am.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.790
And may I ask why?

20:54.790 --> 20:56.960
Why I'm available?

20:56.960 --> 20:58.120
Why you're interested.

20:59.420 --> 21:02.670
Why I'm interested
to be your chief of surgery?

21:02.670 --> 21:03.750
You've worked
at Grey-Sloan Memorial

21:03.750 --> 21:05.420
for a very long time.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.250
You are well-regarded
and well-respected.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.000
Well --
Well, thank you.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.580
But this job
is enormous.

21:10.580 --> 21:12.620
Our new investors are looking
to turn around a hospital

21:12.620 --> 21:14.830
that is ranked last
in Seattle.

21:14.830 --> 21:16.120
This takes vision and --

21:16.120 --> 21:17.960
Vision
and experience, yes.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.790
Some experience,
sure.

21:19.790 --> 21:21.790
But, Dr. Webber,

21:21.790 --> 21:24.460
aren't you considering retiring
anytime soon?

21:28.540 --> 21:30.040
I am not.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.040
Hey.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.330
Hi.
Dr. Avery.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.290
Jackson, please.

21:43.290 --> 21:44.380
Victoria. Vic.

21:44.380 --> 21:45.380
Right, right.

21:45.380 --> 21:47.210
Vic.

21:47.210 --> 21:49.290
I never thanked you.
I should have.

21:49.290 --> 21:50.790
Oh, God, no.
No.

21:50.790 --> 21:52.790
No, my patients
would have been roadkill

21:52.790 --> 21:54.000
if it wasn't
for you.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.420
Well,
how are they doing?

21:55.420 --> 21:57.580
She's doing well.
Actually, really well.

21:57.580 --> 21:59.830
Uh, he's not as well
as I'd...like.

21:59.830 --> 22:01.380
I got you.
Oh, thanks.

22:01.380 --> 22:03.000
But, uh, still,
thank you.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.500
Oh,
just doing my job.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.000
Yeah.
So...

22:10.000 --> 22:11.330
Uh,
you know what?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.170
I'm going to grab
a burger at Joe's.

22:14.670 --> 22:16.830
Yeah, I like burgers,
but, um...

22:16.830 --> 22:19.330
...maybe
some other time?

22:19.330 --> 22:22.000
Deal.

22:27.670 --> 22:30.500
When you tried so hard
to talk to me and I couldn't,

22:30.500 --> 22:34.750
I felt shame, fear,
and pain.

22:34.750 --> 22:37.380
And what was that shame about
for you, Jo?

22:39.040 --> 22:42.040
That I lost the ability

22:42.040 --> 22:44.580
to receive the love
that he was offering.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.380
Tell him.

22:51.620 --> 22:56.210
That I couldn't receive the love
that you were offering...

22:56.210 --> 22:58.710
and, um,
I pushed you away.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.080
I'm sorry,

23:00.080 --> 23:05.540
and I'm afraid that I won't
be able to regain your trust.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.750
Alex?

23:08.750 --> 23:11.460
Did you do
your homework?

23:11.460 --> 23:13.210
Oh.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.290
When you didn't talk to me,
it made me feel --

23:22.290 --> 23:23.750
"I felt."

23:23.750 --> 23:26.170
Nobody makes you feel anything.
Those are your feelings.

23:28.420 --> 23:32.420
When you shut down,
I f-- I felt fear.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.500
I still do.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.330
Can you talk a little more
about that fear?

23:39.330 --> 23:42.170
Alex --

23:43.960 --> 23:45.330
You've had enough pain
and crazy

23:45.330 --> 23:47.170
to last you a lifetime.

23:50.250 --> 23:51.330
You deserve someone

23:51.330 --> 23:53.580
who doesn't
break like glass

23:53.580 --> 23:55.960
and need
to be swept up

23:55.960 --> 23:58.000
and shipped off
to places like this.

23:59.670 --> 24:02.120
Do you think
that person exists?

24:03.880 --> 24:05.000
I think some

24:05.000 --> 24:08.620
are s-stronger
than other-- others.

24:08.620 --> 24:11.790
Jo, you've had
a depressive episode

24:11.790 --> 24:14.960
caused by intense trauma,

24:14.960 --> 24:16.790
and even though
our society tells us

24:16.790 --> 24:20.120
places like this
mean we're broken,

24:20.120 --> 24:23.120
I think the truth is
coming to a place like this

24:23.120 --> 24:24.790
makes you stronger
than most.

24:33.330 --> 24:35.330
Link: There was
an episode of hypotension

24:35.330 --> 24:37.170
in the second surgery,
but we got that under control.

24:37.170 --> 24:38.210
Mm.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.830
That is unlikely
to cause a stroke.

24:40.830 --> 24:42.710
I know.
Try this.

24:42.710 --> 24:45.000
If I eat any more, I'm gonna
have to unbutton my pants.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.210
Hot.

24:46.210 --> 24:50.000
Okay, new game.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.670
Name three things
that you have never done,

24:53.670 --> 24:55.080
but you really
want to do.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.330
Ooh.
Good one.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.920
Um...
Okay.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.580
Surf a 20-foot wave...

25:03.580 --> 25:07.040
um, ride a camel
through the Sahara...
Mm.

25:07.040 --> 25:11.880
...and, um...
cure Parkinson's.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.330
Now you.
Same question.

25:13.330 --> 25:14.750
Okay.

25:14.750 --> 25:17.920
Mm.

25:17.920 --> 25:21.000
Go to a psychic medium
and talk to my dead father,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.620
get licensed
in scuba diving,

25:23.620 --> 25:27.540
and have sex
with more than one person.

25:29.750 --> 25:31.250
You've never done that?

25:31.250 --> 25:33.210
You have?

25:33.210 --> 25:35.710
I lived in Venice Beach
for a year.

25:35.710 --> 25:37.040
So did I.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.540
And you never
had a three-way?

25:38.540 --> 25:39.920
They're offered up
like mints in Venice Beach.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.120
Hmm.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.710
I had
a medical practice there.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.040
Oh.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.080
Yeah, I...
worked in a bike shop.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.540
Fat embolus.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.210
What?

25:53.380 --> 25:56.790
In California,
we had a patient.

25:56.790 --> 25:58.210
Muscle Beach
body builder,

25:58.210 --> 25:59.880
shattered his femur,
just like Jai.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.120
He didn't wake up
from surgery.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.460
It looked like
it was a stroke.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.580
Turns out it was
fat embolism syndrome

26:04.580 --> 26:06.080
from the
long bone injury.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.250
There was
a telltale rash.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.420
Did you check Jai
for a rash?

26:20.580 --> 26:21.960
Wait!

26:21.960 --> 26:23.960
Just stop!
Just wait!
Link:
What are you doing?

26:23.960 --> 26:25.120
Extubating.
Why?

26:25.120 --> 26:26.120
This is
his worst fear.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.250
He doesn't want
to live like this --

26:27.250 --> 26:28.460
hooked up
to machines.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.290
We're climbers.
People have accidents.

26:30.290 --> 26:31.290
We've talked
about this.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.960
We're both
way less afraid of dying

26:32.960 --> 26:34.580
than just
being kept alive on --
He has it.

26:34.580 --> 26:35.920
Has what?
W--

26:35.920 --> 26:38.250
Link, that's it.
That's the rash, under his arm.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.250
Is this reversible
at this stage?

26:40.250 --> 26:41.750
Wait, what -- what rash?
What does that mean?

26:41.750 --> 26:43.670
It means maybe
we can wake him up.

26:52.380 --> 26:55.790
Vic: A fat embolus? That
man didn't have an ounce
of fat on his body.

26:55.790 --> 26:56.790
Jackson: Right.

26:56.790 --> 26:59.330
I mean, it's the fat
from the bone marrow

26:59.330 --> 27:01.120
in long bones
like the femur.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.540
Bone breaks,
and...
Oh.

27:02.540 --> 27:05.170
...that fat can travel
into the bloodstream,

27:05.170 --> 27:06.460
which can get lodged
in the brain,

27:06.460 --> 27:08.330
and it looks like
a stroke.

27:09.620 --> 27:10.790
I never get to know

27:10.790 --> 27:12.670
how the people I rescue
do in the end.

27:12.670 --> 27:15.960
We run into fires
or pull people off of cliffs,

27:15.960 --> 27:17.540
and then
we hand them off to you,

27:17.540 --> 27:19.540
and then we run into
some other fire. So, it's, um...

27:19.540 --> 27:23.540
it's nice, I guess,
to know how he's doing.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.380
I hope
he wakes up.

27:25.380 --> 27:28.000
Yeah, me too.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.210
I...

27:33.210 --> 27:38.210
am just getting out of
a pretty serious relationship.

27:39.580 --> 27:42.210
Uh, me -- me too.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.540
Did you love her?

27:44.540 --> 27:47.170
I did, yeah.

27:47.170 --> 27:48.830
Me too.

27:51.330 --> 27:54.250
And, um,
he -- he died.

27:54.250 --> 27:56.170
Oh, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

27:56.170 --> 27:58.750
Yeah.
Me too.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.500
So, probably...

28:02.500 --> 28:04.500
...not the very best time

28:04.500 --> 28:07.540
for either one of us
to be starting something new.

28:07.540 --> 28:09.620
Yeah, probably not,
because we're both

28:09.620 --> 28:12.080
supposed to just feel miserable
for as long as possible.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.710
So...

28:13.710 --> 28:16.210
Well, if you're gonna
put it like that...

28:18.620 --> 28:20.420
Well...

28:22.250 --> 28:24.380
Man: All the way down
to the corner!

28:24.380 --> 28:25.460
Dr. Grey?

28:25.460 --> 28:26.620
Is that you?

28:26.620 --> 28:28.380
Suzie Wilson.

28:28.380 --> 28:30.750
I'm the classroom mom
at Zola's school.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.620
Hi, Suzie.
Hi.

28:32.620 --> 28:33.790
What are you
doing here?

28:33.790 --> 28:35.290
Is this
some sort of volunteer thing?

28:35.290 --> 28:37.540
Something like that,
yeah.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.920
Oh, I just love that.
Love that you're doing this.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.380
I always wondered why

28:41.380 --> 28:42.710
we never saw you
volunteering at school,

28:42.710 --> 28:44.120
but now I get it.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.210
This is
really nice to see.

28:46.210 --> 28:47.420
You know, Suzie,

28:47.420 --> 28:49.620
when working moms
don't volunteer at school,

28:49.620 --> 28:53.500
it's usually because
we're working in the daytime

28:53.500 --> 28:55.000
and parenting at night,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.120
so we generally don't have time
to participate.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.920
Grey!
This is not happy hour!

29:00.920 --> 29:02.580
Get back to work

29:02.580 --> 29:05.580
before I tell the court
you're in contempt!

29:05.580 --> 29:07.580
Nice to see you,
Suzie.

29:07.580 --> 29:11.170
I appreciate everything you do
for Zola's class.

29:12.580 --> 29:13.620
Go!

29:13.620 --> 29:15.460
I got it!

29:21.920 --> 29:23.960
Hey.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.670
Aren't you still
on maternity leave?

29:26.960 --> 29:28.920
I hate maternity leave.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.580
Which is -- I know.

29:30.580 --> 29:32.330
There are women
the world over

29:32.330 --> 29:34.460
who would kill
for the privilege

29:34.460 --> 29:36.380
of being able
to stay at home

29:36.380 --> 29:38.460
with their newborn baby

29:38.460 --> 29:40.460
and know that they have a job
to come back to.

29:40.460 --> 29:41.620
Mm.

29:41.620 --> 29:42.670
I know that
I should be grateful,

29:42.670 --> 29:44.120
but I hate it.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.710
Owen called me a cow
the other day.

29:46.710 --> 29:48.120
He did what now?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.960
He offered to milk me.

29:52.380 --> 29:53.790
Yeah, I don't even know
what to do with that.

29:53.790 --> 29:57.290
I have a brilliant mind

29:57.290 --> 29:59.710
with no opportunity
to use it.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.670
So,
I-I came to work.

30:01.670 --> 30:04.120
I'm not working,
but I'm at work.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.670
Tell -- Bailey, tell me --
tell me.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.460
Come on, tell me a little bit
about work, please.

30:08.790 --> 30:10.620
I fired
all my favorite people,

30:10.620 --> 30:15.210
and my least favorite person
now has power over me.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.000
And the anger
I feel --

30:18.000 --> 30:21.330
The righteous anger is...

30:21.330 --> 30:23.710
it's exhausting.

30:25.580 --> 30:28.330
I think I might be
a terrible mother.

30:28.330 --> 30:30.080
For what it's worth,

30:30.080 --> 30:33.080
I hated
maternity leave, too.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.830
And I am
an excellent mother.

30:43.710 --> 30:45.420
What do you want?

30:45.420 --> 30:47.750
Richard: Well, that's a nice way
to greet your mentor.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.670
Coffee?

30:51.670 --> 30:53.670
I'd love a cup.

30:59.210 --> 31:00.880
Applied for a job
last week

31:00.880 --> 31:02.620
with
Pacific Northwest General.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.540
Did they call you?

31:04.540 --> 31:06.540
Put you down
as one of my references.

31:06.540 --> 31:07.880
I don't know.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.420
You don't know?

31:09.420 --> 31:11.210
I don't answer the phone
if I don't recognize the number.

31:11.210 --> 31:12.750
You don't check
your messages?

31:12.750 --> 31:15.710
You know,
I hate your generation.

31:15.710 --> 31:18.040
I hate any generation
other than my own.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.540
Same.

31:19.540 --> 31:21.710
Eh, I'm not gonna get
that job.

31:21.710 --> 31:24.380
The woman doing the hiring
is a child.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.540
She practically
called me grandpa.

31:26.540 --> 31:28.880
Well, can't you get your wife
to do something for you?

31:28.880 --> 31:29.960
No.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.880
Where is your wife?

31:33.880 --> 31:35.580
Does she let you
live like this?

31:35.580 --> 31:37.920
Eh,
she's out of town.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.750
Is she coming back?

31:39.750 --> 31:41.250
I don't know.

31:41.250 --> 31:43.420
You know,
so you got to get it.

31:43.420 --> 31:45.290
What?

31:45.290 --> 31:46.920
The job at Pac-North.
I mean, it's still open.

31:46.920 --> 31:47.960
I just checked
this morning.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.460
Wait,
the job's at Pac-North?

31:49.460 --> 31:51.750
Of course it's still open.
Nobody wants to work there.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.460
No, you want
to work there.
Why?

31:53.460 --> 31:55.250
Because you could
turn it around.

31:55.250 --> 31:57.330
And if you get the job,
you can hire me.

31:57.330 --> 31:59.580
Look, Dr. Webber, I really want
to help you, but --

31:59.580 --> 32:01.670
Oh, look at yourself,
Karev!

32:01.670 --> 32:04.080
You're drowning
in your own filth!

32:04.080 --> 32:06.250
I'm not asking you
to help me.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.080
I'm asking you
to help yourself.
Alright,
stop yelling at me.

32:08.080 --> 32:09.250
This is my house,

32:09.250 --> 32:10.790
and I don't
work for you anymore.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.670
Here.

32:18.250 --> 32:21.540
You're worried about
your marriage?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.960
Give your wife
a reason to come back home.

32:31.540 --> 32:34.670
They've been doing this
every day for a week, and
nothing has changed.

32:34.670 --> 32:37.380
It's an experimental protocol.
You have to give it time.

32:37.380 --> 32:40.460
I don't want
to give it time.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.830
I want them to stop.

32:43.460 --> 32:44.960
I promised that I would never
let this happen.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.460
We promised each other.

32:48.290 --> 32:50.000
Stop. Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

32:50.000 --> 32:51.330
Hey. Alright.
Stop!

32:51.330 --> 32:53.000
Hey,
what is going on?

32:53.000 --> 32:54.170
I don't know
what to say.

32:54.170 --> 32:55.290
What if this
makes him just better enough

32:55.290 --> 32:57.120
that he can't die?

32:57.120 --> 32:59.620
What if -- What if this
makes him just better enough

32:59.620 --> 33:02.500
that he is just stuck in
this body for another 20 years?

33:02.500 --> 33:04.330
My husband is living
his worst nightmare!

33:04.330 --> 33:06.040
Mari, Mari, Mari,
look at me, okay?

33:06.040 --> 33:08.330
I know it's easier
to imagine worst-case scenarios

33:08.330 --> 33:10.000
than it is
to hold onto hope, alright?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.080
But we are not
there yet.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.710
Do you understand me?

33:12.710 --> 33:15.040
It is not the time
to give up on him.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.040
Will you tell me
when it's time?

33:20.040 --> 33:23.540
Yes.
I promise I will.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.250
Hi, Mari.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.750
Thanks for coming.
How are you, um --

33:40.750 --> 33:42.500
Please don't ask me
how I'm doing.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.040
Mari, there's something
we want you to see.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.460
Come on.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.420
I found a place
for him.

33:51.420 --> 33:54.420
It's a pretty nice
long-term care facility.

33:54.420 --> 33:57.380
Didn't smell quite as bad
as the other ones that I saw.

34:03.620 --> 34:06.040
Oh, my God.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.960
Oh, my God.
Is this real?

34:07.960 --> 34:09.210
Is...

34:09.210 --> 34:11.710
Are -- Sorry.
Is this real?

34:11.710 --> 34:13.710
Amelia:
It's real.

34:13.710 --> 34:14.960
He's fragile,

34:14.960 --> 34:16.580
but his cognitive tests
are good.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.120
Sometimes the best we can do...

41:00.120 --> 41:03.830
...is bear each other's burdens
and ease each other's pain.

41:03.830 --> 41:08.540
So, Zola overhears
the school-mom

41:08.540 --> 41:11.330
tell the teacher
I'm a criminal,

41:11.330 --> 41:13.460
and then she asks me
how to spell "criminal."

41:14.710 --> 41:15.960
So, that was fun.

41:19.500 --> 41:22.750
Listen, I'm --
you know, I'm healthy.

41:22.750 --> 41:25.080
My kids are healthy.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.830
And I'm not in jail.
Yes.

41:26.830 --> 41:28.330
I'm getting exercise.

41:29.540 --> 41:31.250
It's quite meditative,
actually.

41:31.250 --> 41:32.830
You sort of just
pick up the trash,

41:32.830 --> 41:34.170
one piece at a time,

41:34.170 --> 41:37.880
and I'm helping the city,
I'm helping the planet.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.750
I still feel
a sense of accomplishment.

41:39.750 --> 41:43.500
So, it's kind of like
a roadside vacation, then.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.540
Exactly.

41:44.540 --> 41:46.210
I want
a roadside vacation.
Right?

41:46.210 --> 41:47.500
Maybe I'll go
rob a store or something.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.540
Please don't do that.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.540
What is it?

42:00.500 --> 42:02.170
It's a letter
from the medical board.

42:02.170 --> 42:05.710
They're going to pursue action
against my license.

42:05.710 --> 42:08.250
There'll be a hearing.

42:08.250 --> 42:10.620
And hold each other's hands
in the dark.

42:10.620 --> 42:15.120
♪ You leave me so high and dry ♪
