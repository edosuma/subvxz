WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:04.700
Inhale, tadassana...

00:05.875 --> 00:08.007
Exhale. Padmasana.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.749
Again. Inhale, tadassana...

00:12.186 --> 00:14.057
Exhale. Padmasana.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.886
And as we close
our practice,

00:16.929 --> 00:18.670
let us thank
Lena Luthor

00:18.714 --> 00:21.891
for freeing us from rage
and for bringing us peace.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.721
-Namaste.
- Namaste.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.905
What's going on?

00:35.948 --> 00:37.559
Wh... Why won't
the doors open?

00:37.602 --> 00:39.517
The solar event must've
knocked the power out.

00:39.561 --> 00:42.042
I can't breathe.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.173
I think
he's claustrophobic.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.915
I got
to get out of here!

01:08.764 --> 01:10.766
Is that our invitation
to the Leviathan ship?

01:11.810 --> 01:13.421
I really have to put
a bell on you.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.075
No, but I'm close.

01:15.118 --> 01:18.078
I think Gemma Cooper
is warming to me.

01:18.121 --> 01:20.384
And when she sees
my newest present,

01:20.428 --> 01:21.777
she'll roll out
the red carpet.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.648
Another present
like the Sun-Eater?

01:25.172 --> 01:26.956
I'm a twelfth level
intellect.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.132
Did you really think
I wouldn't connect the dots?

01:29.176 --> 01:32.831
-What's your point?
-Okay. I... I know
that you've been

01:32.875 --> 01:35.399
cozying up to Gemma Cooper
for strategic reasons,

01:35.443 --> 01:37.619
but there's a distinction
between manipulating

01:37.662 --> 01:40.970
Leviathan and helping them
destroy the world!

01:41.013 --> 01:43.973
What kind of operation
do you think this is?

01:44.016 --> 01:45.627
Mr. Smith
Goes to Leviathan?

01:45.670 --> 01:47.150
Sometimes, to get
what you want,

01:47.194 --> 01:48.934
you have to play
a little dirty.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.588
I cannot get
that invitation

01:50.632 --> 01:52.416
unless they think
I'm on their side

01:52.460 --> 01:53.939
and if that means
helping them get

01:53.983 --> 01:55.593
a weapon or two,
so be it.

01:55.637 --> 01:56.681
People could've died.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.467
My friends could've died.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.991
Three months ago,
you said that Leviathan

02:02.034 --> 02:03.471
was our biggest threat,

02:03.514 --> 02:05.168
that if we didn't
defeat them,

02:05.212 --> 02:07.953
the global repercussions
would be catastrophic.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.130
Millions dead,
us and the Supers included.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.610
And your very words were,
"The only way

02:12.654 --> 02:14.482
that you could
successfully defeat them

02:14.525 --> 02:18.094
was by working with me,
by trusting me."

02:18.703 --> 02:20.879
So, trust me now...

02:22.229 --> 02:23.491
because I know
what you're thinking.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.189
You're thinking that
if you can get

02:26.233 --> 02:27.799
the location
of the Leviathan ship

02:27.843 --> 02:29.453
before I get that invitation,

02:29.497 --> 02:33.153
you can maybe end this
before anyone gets hurt.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.720
But that's your anxiety
thinking, not logic.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.637
I don't want
your friends to die either,

02:39.681 --> 02:41.683
but sometimes,
for the greater good,

02:41.726 --> 02:43.293
you have to break
a few super-eggs.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.642
And you expect me
to just stand back

02:44.686 --> 02:46.296
while Leviathan tries
to kill my friends?

02:46.340 --> 02:49.343
I expect you
to trust the process.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.695
War is brewing between
Leviathan and the Supers

02:53.738 --> 02:56.088
and you are not
to intervene.

02:59.353 --> 03:02.182
So, we tried
to find Leviathan's
last known location.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.488
There's no trace,
no hidden signs,

03:04.532 --> 03:07.230
no radiation.
Even the elevator was gone.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.101
J'onn is out scanning
for any other signs

03:09.145 --> 03:11.060
of Leviathan right now.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.496
We don't even know
if their headquarters

03:12.540 --> 03:15.020
are in National City
on this Earth.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.544
Well, one thing
that we do know

03:16.587 --> 03:20.374
is that Leviathan strikes
quickly after a failure.

03:20.417 --> 03:24.029
I wish Brainy would give us
another crack at that Morae.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.509
What I'd really like
to know is

03:25.553 --> 03:28.251
why Lena was at the Fortress
at the exact same time.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.731
Myriad is a trigger
for Lena.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.037
So, maybe her arrival
is a coincidence.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.692
Like it was a coincidence
that Lex just heroed in

03:34.736 --> 03:36.172
and saved all those
coma patients

03:36.216 --> 03:39.219
the exact same day Leviathan
tried to destroy the sun?

03:39.262 --> 03:41.699
No. Where there is smoke,
there is a Luthor.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.571
Right now, we have
no reason to believe

03:43.614 --> 03:45.268
that Lena is involved
with Leviathan.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.052
We have no reason
to believe she isn't.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.794
Okay. So, let's start
with something that we do know.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.539
Rama Khan.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.542
Except he hasn't been
seen on this Earth
for hundreds of years.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.370
I can monitor for
unusual seismic activity

04:00.414 --> 04:01.719
until J'onn gets back.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.113
Rama Khan isn't
the only member of Leviathan.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.549
So, we should search
for record

04:05.593 --> 04:07.247
of any others
throughout history.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.597
How can we do that
without the DEO's database?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.468
Kelly's mentioned
an old military friend

04:11.512 --> 04:13.731
who's an expert in
semiotics and iconography

04:13.775 --> 04:15.255
and he's currently
an archivist

04:15.298 --> 04:17.257
at the United States
Congressional Library.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.563
So, I will ask her
to reach out to him

04:19.607 --> 04:21.086
and maybe he can help.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.566
I'll stay here,

04:22.610 --> 04:24.394
see if I can't dream
of Leviathan's
new headquarters.

04:24.438 --> 04:27.136
Good. Look,
we've stopped him before,

04:27.179 --> 04:28.833
we can do it again.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.358
And this time, we'll take down
both the Luthors and Leviathan.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.930
So, the blackout provoked
the subject to have
some sort of episode?

04:38.974 --> 04:40.105
No, I think something's
interfering with

04:40.149 --> 04:41.542
his Non Nocere directive.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.761
Do you think your BFF
messing with Myriad Q-waves

04:43.805 --> 04:45.110
yesterday had anything
to do with it?

04:45.154 --> 04:46.460
That was the very
first thing I thought of,

04:46.503 --> 04:47.765
but I checked and it didn't.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.637
Well, even still,
I could have a bag

04:49.680 --> 04:51.987
of Kryptonite dumplings
delivered to her door.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.122
Mr. Luthor,

04:57.166 --> 04:59.124
I didn't know you were
gonna be here, too.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.517
What an honor.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.302
And I had no idea you...

05:03.477 --> 05:04.695
existed.

05:04.739 --> 05:07.307
This is Steve Lomelli.
I asked him to come.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.830
He was with Klaus
when he changed,

05:08.873 --> 05:11.485
but Steve's Non Nocere
directive is still intact.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.965
So, it was
an isolated incident.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.794
Great. Just need to re-adjust
the Q-wave frequencies

05:16.838 --> 05:19.667
and that should re-establish
Non Nocere.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.234
Don't worry.
I turned the sun red.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.324
I think we can fix
one broken inmate.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.852
Imagine a place where
there's only peace,

05:30.895 --> 05:33.507
connection, unity,

05:33.550 --> 05:35.465
where we can connect
with everyone,

05:35.509 --> 05:38.033
past, present and future,

05:38.076 --> 05:40.688
where a lost loved one
can stand by your side

05:40.731 --> 05:42.211
once more.

05:42.254 --> 05:46.520
I give you Obsidian North's
greatest VR achievement,

05:46.563 --> 05:49.697
the Obsidian Worldwide
Unity Festival.

05:53.222 --> 05:56.181
An Obsidian employee
kidnaps hundreds of users

05:56.225 --> 05:57.879
and the next day,
we're planning

05:57.922 --> 06:00.490
a Live Aid 2020.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.883
If Margot Morrison had
anything to do

06:01.926 --> 06:04.364
with the glitch
that trapped Alex,

06:04.407 --> 06:06.540
who knows what else
she may have planted.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.237
Great. Everyone, thank you.
That'll be it.

06:11.893 --> 06:15.200
-Andrea.
-Kelly. Isn't this exciting?

06:15.244 --> 06:16.506
We're obviously
working late tonight.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.290
I was thinking Thai.
There's so much to do.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.206
Andrea, we are not
in a position to launch

06:21.250 --> 06:22.251
such a massive event.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.731
After what we just
went through,

06:23.774 --> 06:25.907
-we have a responsibility--
-I told you.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.778
I took care of that
glitch personally.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.693
We're clean.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.087
And right now, we have
what every company needs,

06:32.130 --> 06:34.089
-momentum.
-To launch this event

06:34.132 --> 06:37.092
without proper vetting,
is reckless.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.268
We owe it to our users
to make sure it's safe.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.444
It is safe.

06:41.488 --> 06:45.230
So, unless you have
specific proof that it's not,

06:45.274 --> 06:46.971
please do not waste
my time with this, again.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.239
So, wait, this is
the army buddy

06:54.283 --> 06:55.458
Malefic impersonated?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.112
Yes, but this is
the real Pete

06:57.155 --> 06:59.070
and Kelly adores him.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.072
-You must be Alex.
-Hi.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.118
Kelly couldn't stop
talking about you
when she called.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.425
Oh, hey, thanks so much
for meeting with us.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.470
Uh, Pete Andrews,
this is Kara Danvers,
my sister.

07:07.514 --> 07:08.863
Hi, nice to meet you.

07:08.906 --> 07:11.300
Of CatCo Worldwide Media.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.955
Your use of syntax
and imagery is sublime,

07:13.998 --> 07:16.740
suggesting a much deeper
understanding of language

07:16.784 --> 07:18.089
than just modern English.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.743
Uh, thank you.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.963
Did you spend a lot
of time growing up
in foreign countries?

07:22.006 --> 07:24.444
Uh, no.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.793
We're Midvale born
and raised.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.359
Yup. Yup.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.492
Although right now, I feel
a little like Eliza Doolittle.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.277
"The rain in Spain...

07:32.321 --> 07:34.802
...stays, um,
mainly in the plain."

07:34.845 --> 07:36.456
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

07:36.499 --> 07:39.459
Occupational hazard
for a linguist.
I can't turn it off.

07:39.502 --> 07:42.331
Kelly said that you need help
finding a unique symbol?

07:42.374 --> 07:44.638
Yes. It belongs
to a very dangerous

07:44.681 --> 07:46.117
organization that
we're tracking.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.120
We're trying to find
any evidence of it on Earth.

07:49.164 --> 07:52.167
Buildings, temples,
whatever can pinpoint us

07:52.210 --> 07:53.864
to their current location,

07:53.908 --> 07:56.345
Though we think they were
behind the solar event
yesterday.

07:57.389 --> 08:00.175
-They're called Leviathan.
-Leviathan?

08:00.218 --> 08:02.525
I've heard whispers about them,
but only as myth.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.614
Well, we can assure you
they are very real,

08:04.658 --> 08:06.181
and they are very dangerous.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.662
I think I know
where to start.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.371
Neat party trick.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.982
Do you use that at your
corporate cocktail soirees?

08:25.026 --> 08:26.070
Don't be bitter.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.332
You had your chance
at the throne.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.857
Oh, you think
you can fare better?

08:29.900 --> 08:33.643
With those idiotic ringlets
and obnoxious
porcelain cheek bones.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.645
You are a bolt
of power and fear,

08:35.688 --> 08:37.342
and yet you insist
on wearing this

08:37.385 --> 08:38.692
stupid human shell.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.043
You're an insult.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.567
You are just jealous
because I have evolved.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.529
Fitting in with the humans
has allowed me to lull them

08:49.572 --> 08:51.705
into a false sense
of security.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.358
You should really
consider it.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.882
What's in there?
Poison lipstick?

09:01.758 --> 09:03.586
This was stolen from us
years ago.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.023
Lex Luthor found it
just wasting away

09:06.067 --> 09:08.548
in a chilly place that
you know quite well.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.681
So, you came here
to gloat.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.205
I came here to give you
a second chance

09:14.249 --> 09:16.033
to destroy the Supers.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.731
You know what this
weapon is,

09:17.774 --> 09:19.428
so you know what it needs.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.431
Get it for me.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.914
And this time,
do not fail.

09:32.180 --> 09:35.052
In 1752, a series
of crop circles

09:35.096 --> 09:37.141
appeared in Greece,
only weeks before

09:37.185 --> 09:39.753
a plague of locusts
took out the entire region.

09:39.796 --> 09:42.582
But this symbol is similar,
but it's slightly off.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.019
Well, symbols like languages
evolve over time.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.718
But all of these

09:48.762 --> 09:50.590
have the same DNA.
Look at this.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.070
567 A.D, Macedonia,

09:53.114 --> 09:55.725
1134 A.D, Bavaria.

09:55.769 --> 09:58.293
Each time this symbol
has appeared,

09:58.336 --> 09:59.816
catastrophe has followed.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.601
There's gotta be a way
to use this pattern

10:01.644 --> 10:03.994
to predict where
Leviathan is now.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.127
Well, there's a special
collections room
in the library,

10:06.170 --> 10:07.345
might have more information.

10:08.129 --> 10:09.086
I'll go try to get access.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.348
-Great.
-Be right back.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.751
You know what?

10:21.795 --> 10:22.970
I'm starting to get it.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.842
The desire to be
in a new reality,

10:25.886 --> 10:29.106
to live in a world that's
a little less complicated.

10:29.150 --> 10:32.457
Hmm. Is this about
your run-in with Lena?

10:32.501 --> 10:35.025
She was so kind
after Jeremiah died,

10:35.069 --> 10:37.680
and then... and then she
breaks into the fortress

10:37.724 --> 10:40.857
and accuses me,
me, of hypocrisy.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.293
And you know what?
The more I think about it,

10:42.337 --> 10:43.773
the more the pattern
makes sense.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.471
Her and Lex are working
on something with Leviathan,

10:46.515 --> 10:48.648
and it makes me
so angry,

10:48.691 --> 10:50.214
I... I just...
I wanna--

10:50.258 --> 10:51.346
Hide?

10:55.698 --> 10:57.178
William, what's going on?

10:57.221 --> 10:59.310
I've been dissecting
Margot Morrison's
manifesto video.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.791
I think I found something
you're gonna want to see.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.358
I'll be right there.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.534
William thinks he found
something connected
to Margot.

11:05.577 --> 11:06.666
Go. Check it out.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.058
-I'll stay with Pete.
-Thank you.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.016
Yeah.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.978
Hey, I'm so sorry.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.893
Kara had a work emergency.
She had to go.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.809
Oh, that's all right. I think
we may have hit a wall anyway.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.551
All of my requests
were completely denied,

11:22.594 --> 11:23.552
which is strange,
because I've been

11:23.595 --> 11:25.554
in that room
many times.

11:25.597 --> 11:28.731
I think it stopped when
I mentioned
the word Leviathan.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.733
Which means that
we must've struck a nerve.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.256
And in my experience,

11:32.300 --> 11:33.910
that means that we're on
the right path.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.565
Maybe. I mean,
they shut me down cold.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.393
So we find a new way.

11:38.436 --> 11:39.829
Pete, if we are right
about this,

11:39.873 --> 11:41.744
this is a matter
of global security.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.616
We cannot be concerned
about breaking the rules.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.055
-Now, are you with me?
-Yeah.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.621
Lead the way.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.854
Why are his eyes
like that?

12:04.898 --> 12:06.900
The Q-waves have
a direct effect on his irises.

12:06.943 --> 12:09.163
The inkiness indicates
an irregular break.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.560
Did Klaus hurt
the other prisoner

12:15.604 --> 12:17.214
before his eyes turned?
Or after?

12:17.258 --> 12:18.955
Before. Definitely before.

12:20.609 --> 12:21.871
What if the act of violence

12:21.915 --> 12:23.568
isn't a result
of Non Nocere failing?

12:23.612 --> 12:25.222
What if the act itself
caused the failure?

12:25.266 --> 12:26.441
His need to survive

12:26.484 --> 12:28.399
clashed with his directive
to do no harm.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.879
Klaus felt like his life
was in danger.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.403
His brain adapted,
it evolved
to protect himself.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.884
But now,
his survival instincts,
they're in overdrive.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.234
You can fix it, right?

12:37.278 --> 12:39.889
I mean, after all
you've done for us here,

12:39.933 --> 12:42.805
now that I'm free
from fear and anger,

12:42.849 --> 12:45.286
I'm finally enjoying life

12:45.329 --> 12:47.331
and the community.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.464
I forgot what it was like
to have friends.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.690
Are you feeling okay after
what happened in the elevator?

13:11.703 --> 13:14.141
Technology is
the greatest evil

13:14.184 --> 13:15.707
mankind has ever faced.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.668
See? Right there.

13:21.409 --> 13:22.845
Oh, my God.
You're right.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.674
Whoever that is, they're
wearing an Image Inducer.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.328
But why would someone
imitate her?

13:27.371 --> 13:29.634
You said she worked
at Obsidian North?

13:29.678 --> 13:31.811
Let's get our hands on
Obsidian's personnel files,

13:31.854 --> 13:33.247
see everyone she was
in contact with.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.688
I expanded my search,
but no sign of Leviathan

13:39.731 --> 13:42.299
anywhere within
a 300-mile radius.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.867
Hmm. Perhaps, we can
try again later.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.653
Oh, yeah. It's a little
unconventional, I know.

13:48.697 --> 13:52.570
To go out wearing this face,
but I like it like this.

13:52.614 --> 13:53.963
I'm just as much
J'onn J'onzz

13:54.007 --> 13:55.965
the human as I am
the Martian Manhunter.

13:56.009 --> 13:58.489
The last time I saw you,

13:58.533 --> 14:01.492
you were wrestling with
your own sense of self,

14:01.536 --> 14:03.233
burdened by the ghost
of your father.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.975
But now...

14:06.019 --> 14:07.847
You're finally in command
of who you are.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.718
And you,
the last time I saw you,

14:09.761 --> 14:12.503
you were engaged in
endless Martian civil wars--

14:12.547 --> 14:14.679
Until your brother's
heroic return to Mars,

14:14.723 --> 14:16.856
which was nothing
short of a miracle.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.554
We're finally on the path
to peace because of him.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.993
Because of you.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.561
Well, I guess we were both
in different places back then.

14:27.649 --> 14:28.737
But I gotta say,

14:30.957 --> 14:32.306
I'm really glad
you're here now.

14:42.577 --> 14:46.015
-Should we wake her, or--
-No, no, no. That's, uh...

14:46.059 --> 14:47.060
That's just how
she works.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.762
-I don't understand it.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.372
Every time we try
to re-establish

14:55.416 --> 14:57.374
Non Nocere in the subject,
his vitals spike

14:57.418 --> 14:59.202
and his body's
overriding it.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.596
It's like he's treating
my directive
like some kind of flu virus.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.206
Try again.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.078
We've already
given what we can.
Any more would kill him.

15:05.121 --> 15:07.515
Uh, guys.

15:21.703 --> 15:22.791
It's spreading.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.619
Wait. I created
a safe environment,

15:24.662 --> 15:26.490
free from outside predators

15:26.534 --> 15:27.927
so that the prisoners
would be safe.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.319
But when Klaus turned,

15:30.146 --> 15:31.669
he became the predator,

15:31.713 --> 15:33.280
triggering the survival
instincts in
the other inmate.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.108
So, when he attacked
the other inmate
in the elevator--

15:35.151 --> 15:36.631
A domino effect was born.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.503
Evolution is a bitch.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.084
Hello?

16:10.882 --> 16:12.319
Get out of my dreams, Brainy.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.018
Get out of my dreams!

16:40.521 --> 16:41.348
Gotcha.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.178
Mmm. Mmm.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.049
Seriously, what do
you put in these things?

16:47.093 --> 16:49.182
I can't stop eating them.
They're so good.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.271
Crack.

16:51.314 --> 16:54.535
Just kidding. But seriously,
um, I can't tell you.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.885
Chef Emile would drag me
to patisserie prison

16:56.928 --> 16:58.234
for even hinting at it.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.543
So, I didn't find any
communication between

17:02.586 --> 17:04.066
Margot and the Luthors.

17:04.109 --> 17:05.154
But she did spend
a lot of time

17:05.198 --> 17:07.896
talking to
this employee, 873.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.376
No name.
Just a badge number.

17:09.419 --> 17:13.205
Well, then let's find
this mysterious number 873.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.338
Supergirl,
Dreamer just woke up
from a vision.

17:15.382 --> 17:18.602
We believe Rama Khan
is at the Oregon Geological Monitoring Station.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.430
We think he's gonna
trigger a massive earthquake.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.740
Uh... Oh, shoot.

17:25.782 --> 17:28.525
-Shoot. It's my sister's cat.
-Oh.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.224
He got out again.
I gotta go.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.703
I'll come with you.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.357
Cats love me,
for some reason.

17:34.401 --> 17:35.750
Of course they do.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.405
Uh, but this one, he gets
real skittish around...

17:39.145 --> 17:41.103
around tall guys with...

17:41.147 --> 17:43.540
accents and...
and he bites.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.239
Well, a shy biter. He...

17:46.282 --> 17:48.589
You call Kelly
about number 873.

17:48.632 --> 17:49.590
I'll be right back.

17:53.463 --> 17:54.769
It's over, Rama Khan.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.083
Oh, no.
It's just begun.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.392
We're in a massive
subduction zone.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.133
If it ruptures, the results
will be devastating.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.787
Then we should
stop that from happening.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.879
Director Dox,

18:17.922 --> 18:19.402
we have reports that
Rama Khan has triggered

18:19.446 --> 18:21.230
a massive seismic event
in Portland.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.754
Supergirl and her allies
are already there, sir.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.016
Should we provide backup?

18:27.889 --> 18:28.803
Yes.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.154
I think I can fix this.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.243
I can reset everything
with a burst of Q-waves.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.331
We just need to reconfigure

18:35.375 --> 18:36.637
the Q-wave generator
in my office.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.421
It's on the other side
of the prison.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.944
All right.
Safety in numbers.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.294
I'm coming with you.

18:50.825 --> 18:51.652
Excuse me.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.308
Lena, help!

19:02.097 --> 19:03.142
Stop, please!

19:06.667 --> 19:07.842
Oh, are you all right?

19:35.739 --> 19:37.480
We need to get the staff.

19:37.524 --> 19:38.873
It's enhancing his powers.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.189
Supergirl,
we've stopped the quake.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.364
We're gonna go put
the town back together.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.371
Thank you for the assistance,
we'll take it from here.

19:58.414 --> 20:01.025
Assistance?
We found him.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.201
We get to question him first.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.506
Absolutely not.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.726
Leviathan is the DEO's
top priority.

20:05.769 --> 20:08.859
No, Brainy, the DEO
might be compromised.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.339
I have reason to believe
that Lex

20:10.383 --> 20:11.514
has been working
with Leviathan.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.560
You turn Rama Khan
into the DEO,

20:14.778 --> 20:16.302
who knows
what Lex will do.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.522
I'm sorry.
My decision is final.

20:19.566 --> 20:20.741
Rama Khan comes with me.

20:21.785 --> 20:22.786
So are we.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.704
The Special Collections Room
is right here.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.097
Okay.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.881
Well, just keep watch.
I need a minute.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.579
We only have one.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.971
It's the 5:00 p.m.
shift change.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.582
The new guard's gonna be
coming on duty any second.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.587
- Run.

21:13.837 --> 21:14.664
What's wrong?

21:15.448 --> 21:17.319
It's just...

21:17.363 --> 21:20.409
Something about that staff
is giving me bad vibes.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.804
Hey, Brainy.

21:23.847 --> 21:26.154
We need to find out
if Leviathan
has anything else planned.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.590
I will.

21:27.634 --> 21:28.983
You and Dreamer can watch
from the observation room.

21:29.026 --> 21:30.332
Whoa, whoa, wait.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.595
You said
I could go in there
with you.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.162
I said you could come
to the DEO.

21:35.381 --> 21:38.122
Look, this is a very
sensitive prisoner.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.776
By my calculations,
any interrogation will be

21:39.820 --> 21:42.301
85% more successful
without you in the room.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.606
Brainy...

21:43.650 --> 21:45.304
Are you really going
to shut us out like that?

21:45.347 --> 21:47.480
Did you call me when you found
Rama Khan's location?

21:48.568 --> 21:49.395
Did you?

21:55.357 --> 21:57.359
Are you sure
this is a good idea,

21:57.403 --> 21:59.013
leaving Brainy alone
in there with him?

21:59.056 --> 22:00.623
No, I don't love it,

22:00.667 --> 22:03.365
but it is Brainy's DEO.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.845
Brainy was in
my dream of Rama Khan.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.501
What was he doing?

22:08.544 --> 22:10.851
He was playing games
with Rama Khan.

22:10.894 --> 22:14.507
More like, Brainy was
using Rama Khan.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.688
So, it's just you
and me now, Coluan.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.214
You will tell me
what I want to know.

22:27.563 --> 22:28.695
Your fellow Leviathan,

22:29.609 --> 22:31.219
your headquarters,

22:31.262 --> 22:32.699
your endgame.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.048
And why would I do that?

22:39.749 --> 22:40.968
How is my wife?

22:41.011 --> 22:42.448
She's sure somebody's
watching the house.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.885
Oh, God. I'm so sorry for
dragging you into all this.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.495
No, I jumped willingly.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.367
But I think I better keep
my head down for a bit.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.717
I got a friend who's gonna get
my family and me off the grid.

22:50.760 --> 22:51.935
You should think
about it, too.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.763
Not until we bring
all of Leviathan down.

22:54.721 --> 22:55.722
Alex...

22:55.765 --> 22:57.680
For what it's worth,

22:57.724 --> 23:00.117
you still sound like someone
who's a part of the military.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.728
I get it.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.512
Shifting to civilian life
can be hard.

23:03.556 --> 23:04.731
It took me months, years.

23:05.558 --> 23:06.733
Hell, if you ask my wife,

23:06.776 --> 23:09.257
I still think I'm leading
a platoon of 20.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.259
You get used to the
power of the uniform.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.131
There comes a day
when you realize...

23:15.568 --> 23:16.482
you gotta let it go.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.400
Thanks again
for helping me out.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.227
I know it goes against
Andrea's orders,

23:23.271 --> 23:25.099
and I don't want to get you
in any more trouble.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.406
All right, let's see
who you are,
Employee 873.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.108
Eve Tessmacher.

23:35.501 --> 23:36.327
Did you know her?

23:37.328 --> 23:39.766
Oh, in another life.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.942
And if she's still
who I think she is...

23:43.596 --> 23:44.945
this is bad news.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.655
Wait, what did he say?

23:59.699 --> 24:01.483
That's not
a language I know,

24:01.527 --> 24:03.790
or ever heard Brainy use.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.625
Did he just say "Luthor"?

24:35.212 --> 24:36.170
What is it?

24:36.213 --> 24:37.214
Something's wrong.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.348
Rama Khan's staff.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.871
It's scanning the DEO
for something.

24:51.838 --> 24:52.882
It's a trap!

24:58.018 --> 24:59.367
Not so fast.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.200
The prisoner has escaped.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.636
Initiate Protocol Five.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.031
Evacuate the DEO.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.225
Enough!

25:38.232 --> 25:40.060
And now to get
what I came for.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.129
I can't find
the right frequency,
I need more time.

26:09.306 --> 26:10.438
Back in a minute.

26:16.749 --> 26:17.750
Gentlemen!

26:18.664 --> 26:19.926
Shall we dance?

26:30.153 --> 26:31.328
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

26:47.170 --> 26:47.997
Steve!

26:52.698 --> 26:53.916
Are you okay?

26:53.960 --> 26:54.787
Yeah.

26:56.310 --> 26:57.354
Except...

26:57.877 --> 26:59.008
What?

26:59.052 --> 27:01.315
I feel like I used to feel.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.795
The peace.

27:04.361 --> 27:05.798
It's all gone.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.548
Rama Khan! Over here.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.071
M'gann! No!

28:52.643 --> 28:53.470
Is everyone safe?

28:54.776 --> 28:56.038
Everyone's fine.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.387
But Rama Khan's gone.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.041
We need to find him.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.434
J'onn and M'gann are
out looking for him.

29:00.477 --> 29:01.914
He could be
anywhere by now.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.785
Well, then we'll
look everywhere.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.049
We'll start at the Tower.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.747
See if we can trace
his seismic signature.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.622
-I'm needed here,
but I--
-Don't.

29:14.665 --> 29:16.406
-Nia.
-No!

29:16.450 --> 29:17.886
When you took off
your inhibitors,

29:17.930 --> 29:20.106
I swore to be there for you
no matter what.

29:23.370 --> 29:25.415
But, maybe I was wrong.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.896
Because I don't know
who this Brainy is.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.419
But, I know
I don't like him.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.552
And I definitely don't
trust him.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.034
Look...

29:36.165 --> 29:37.297
I can't explain.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.733
No more riddles.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.692
What the hell were you doing
in there with Rama Khan?

29:43.477 --> 29:44.739
What was that language?

29:44.783 --> 29:47.307
And what did Lex Luthor
have to do with it?

29:50.136 --> 29:51.180
Tell me.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.794
Right here, right now.

30:02.670 --> 30:03.845
I can't.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.025
You can't play the game
from both sides, Brainy.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.813
You can't pretend to be
on our side one minute

30:14.856 --> 30:16.249
and then push us away
the next.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.732
If you can't pick a side,
I'll choose one for you.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.176
And this is who?

30:30.219 --> 30:33.657
She apparently
has a list of names
and identities...

30:33.701 --> 30:35.181
Her real name
is Eve Tessmacher

30:35.224 --> 30:37.879
and she's a very
dangerous individual.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.402
Well, it says here,
we hired her

30:39.446 --> 30:42.014
on direct, personal
recommendation of
Gemma Cooper,

30:42.057 --> 30:43.842
our board chair
and my friend.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.018
No criminal record,

30:46.061 --> 30:47.758
no black marks
on her file,

30:48.934 --> 30:51.327
practically
a model citizen.

30:51.371 --> 30:54.678
I don't know
what kind of game
you two are playing,

30:54.722 --> 30:57.899
coming to me with these
concerns based on nothing.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.423
But I've worked too hard
to get this company
to where it is

31:00.467 --> 31:02.251
to lose momentum now.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.427
If you can't find it in you
to get fully behind

31:04.471 --> 31:07.343
Obsidian Worldwide's
Unity Festival,

31:07.387 --> 31:11.043
then perhaps,
you should consider
finding the door.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.448
Peace at last.

31:25.492 --> 31:28.712
It took a bit of persuading,
but the prisoners have been
pacified and neutralized.

31:28.756 --> 31:29.931
They're ready for
the next round.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.068
Non Nocere is dead.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.202
It doesn't work.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.943
It can't.
It never could.

31:44.119 --> 31:47.427
Pain is a necessary part
of being human, of life.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.732
And I was delusional
to think

31:48.776 --> 31:50.647
that I could save people,
or fix it.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.914
Humanity will always try
to protect itself, to evolve.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.480
You can't stop that.

31:57.524 --> 32:00.440
You saw Steve,
how helpless he was,
all because of me.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.486
I was rooting for you, Lena.

32:04.009 --> 32:04.966
But,

32:05.967 --> 32:06.968
I have to agree.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.450
Humanity can't be fixed.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.933
They need to be controlled.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.676
Leviathan may be
our biggest threat,

32:19.720 --> 32:21.330
but they were right
about one thing.

32:22.462 --> 32:25.987
Humanity needs a firm hand
to guide it.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.468
To lead it.

32:29.817 --> 32:32.472
And not some
arrogant alien.

32:33.864 --> 32:35.170
It needs to be human.

32:39.653 --> 32:40.828
You mean, a Luthor.

32:42.656 --> 32:45.267
Think of all that we could
accomplish together,

32:45.311 --> 32:49.315
if we just take our rightful
place as humanity's saviors.

32:51.491 --> 32:52.666
Saviors?

32:56.148 --> 32:57.323
Of course.

32:59.151 --> 33:00.369
You never change.

33:03.155 --> 33:04.983
This was always

33:05.026 --> 33:06.332
all about you,

33:07.507 --> 33:08.812
your megalomania.

33:08.856 --> 33:12.033
You... knew my plan
wouldn't work,

33:12.077 --> 33:13.295
that it was doomed.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.296
You were counting on it.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.994
How dare you?

33:17.169 --> 33:18.474
I gave you the world.

33:18.518 --> 33:19.649
Everything.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.173
I supported you.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.870
I sabotaged nothing,

33:22.913 --> 33:24.524
touched nothing.

33:24.567 --> 33:27.744
I set aside my own goals
for you.

33:27.788 --> 33:31.313
Because you needed to see
your little project fail

33:31.357 --> 33:33.576
with your own eyes.

33:33.620 --> 33:36.492
To know the true depravity
of humanity.

33:36.536 --> 33:39.800
To know that my way
was the only way.

33:52.073 --> 33:52.987
You're a monster.

33:57.252 --> 33:59.646
But that doesn't mean
I have to be one, too.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.918
We've lost the DEO,
we've lost Brainy.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.572
Leviathan has Kryptonite.

34:13.616 --> 34:16.271
Without Lena to build
me a Kryptonite suit,

34:17.141 --> 34:18.534
I have nothing.

34:18.578 --> 34:19.753
We still have each other.

34:20.449 --> 34:21.581
And we will stop them.

34:22.625 --> 34:23.713
Go home.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.280
We'll deal with this
in the morning.

34:33.853 --> 34:34.811
M'gann.

34:39.164 --> 34:42.080
I can't find Rama Khan's
energy signal.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.386
I've lost his trail.

34:44.429 --> 34:45.605
Listen, listen, listen.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.782
I nearly lost you
out there today.

34:50.478 --> 34:52.090
-I'm just not sure I can--

34:54.657 --> 34:56.094
J'onn.

34:57.269 --> 34:58.444
It's okay.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.638
- Hey.
-Hi.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.162
How did it go with Pete?

35:22.294 --> 35:24.600
Oh.

35:24.644 --> 35:25.993
Not so good.

35:26.036 --> 35:29.039
Um, we were ambushed
by Leviathan.

35:29.083 --> 35:30.171
Wait, what?

35:30.215 --> 35:31.172
Pete's okay.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.653
It's fine. I just...

35:33.696 --> 35:35.785
Look, I made a mistake.

35:35.829 --> 35:41.139
I just...
I pressed and I put him
in danger.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.446
I just...

35:44.490 --> 35:48.189
I'm not used to
being so exposed.

35:48.233 --> 35:52.280
And now with the DEO,
it's gone...

35:52.324 --> 35:53.238
I'm so sorry.

35:55.501 --> 35:59.200
Oh, and speaking
of exposed,

35:59.244 --> 36:02.160
William and I discovered
that Eve Tessmacher

36:02.203 --> 36:03.900
has been working
for Obsidian.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.989
Have you talked
to Andrea?

36:06.033 --> 36:07.165
She didn't care.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.992
In this world
there is no record

36:09.036 --> 36:11.212
of Eve being anything
but perfect.

36:12.561 --> 36:15.521
She threatened to fire me
if I came to her again.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.305
-Come on.
-Yeah.

36:17.349 --> 36:20.178
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna leave Obsidian?

36:20.221 --> 36:21.962
No.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.094
No. That'll make it
much harder
to get to the bottom of this.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.313
I just...

36:26.401 --> 36:27.968
I've got to get better
at hiding.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.059
Maybe you should, too.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.106
What do you mean,
like, wear a mask?

36:37.238 --> 36:38.544
It worked for my brother.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.722
If you're going to be
a vigilante,

36:43.897 --> 36:45.377
you might as well
go all the way.

36:50.599 --> 36:51.774
Mr. Luthor?

36:51.818 --> 36:52.949
We got the prisoners
back in their cells.

36:52.993 --> 36:54.081
What do you want us
to do with them?

37:04.439 --> 37:05.614
Burn it.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.585
Just the person I was
hoping to hear from.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.760
Did you get my gift?

37:20.803 --> 37:21.891
Oh, yes.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.589
I am very grateful.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.547
How grateful?

37:25.591 --> 37:28.158
Regarding your request
to meet my colleagues,

37:28.202 --> 37:30.248
I'll send you a car
tomorrow morning.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.206
Well, now I'm grateful.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.208
See you tomorrow.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.742
Eventful day, Director Dox?

37:46.786 --> 37:50.485
I know. I disobeyed
your direct order.

37:50.529 --> 37:53.314
I interfered with Leviathan
and the Supers.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.838
I am responsible.

37:58.319 --> 37:59.451
For everything.

38:05.805 --> 38:08.329
Oh, Dox.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.200
Of course, I knew that
you'd rush in

38:10.244 --> 38:11.811
to help your little friends.

38:11.854 --> 38:14.117
You're all gooey hero
on the inside.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.684
I don't have to be a genius
to know that.

38:16.250 --> 38:17.469
But don't worry.

38:17.512 --> 38:18.818
Everything is right on track.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.037
Even the loss of the DEO
is a tax write-off.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.824
You wanted Rama Khan
to be brought here.

38:26.695 --> 38:27.783
To get the Kryptonite.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.829
I gave Leviathan
a little trinket

38:29.872 --> 38:32.135
from the Fortress that,
with Kryptonite,

38:32.179 --> 38:33.702
will make Supergirl's life
miserable.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.009
And they were
very appreciative.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.230
You got an invite
to the ship.

38:41.188 --> 38:42.058
I told you,

38:42.668 --> 38:44.539
trust the process,

38:44.583 --> 38:45.671
save the world.

38:46.498 --> 38:47.325
Get some sleep.

38:48.064 --> 38:48.891
Big day tomorrow.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.094
I have made
a terrible mistake.

40:03.792 --> 40:04.663
I was hurt.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.102
I was so hurt. And...

40:10.756 --> 40:12.497
I thought I could
get rid of the hurt.

40:14.455 --> 40:15.717
I thought that
I knew better,

40:15.761 --> 40:17.240
that I could make
the world
a better place.

40:17.284 --> 40:18.328
But I was wrong.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.637
That hurt, um,

40:24.639 --> 40:27.120
took me down
a dark, dark path,

40:28.513 --> 40:30.558
where I was

40:30.602 --> 40:32.299
blind to what I was
really doing,

40:33.169 --> 40:34.432
to what I'd become.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.568
You were right.

40:40.612 --> 40:43.615
This whole time
I became a villain,
and then...

40:45.355 --> 40:47.923
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

40:47.967 --> 40:50.796
I know what I said
and I know what I did,
but I am...

40:55.191 --> 40:59.326
I am really hoping that you
will believe me right now.
Okay?

41:01.154 --> 41:03.330
Lex is working
with Leviathan,

41:03.373 --> 41:05.288
and they are going
to use Obsidian

41:05.332 --> 41:06.638
to do something terrible...

41:08.335 --> 41:09.641
using the system,

41:10.816 --> 41:12.905
that I made
with my project.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.823
I didn't know I was
helping them, but I did.
And...

41:18.824 --> 41:21.217
now I want to help
stop them, so...

41:25.047 --> 41:26.092
Please, okay?

41:28.573 --> 41:31.924
I want to help stop
Lex and Leviathan.

41:45.372 --> 41:46.504
Sit down.
